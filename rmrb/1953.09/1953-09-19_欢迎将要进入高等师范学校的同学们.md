Welcome to the Students Who Will Enter Higher Normal Schools
Lin Liru, Vice Minister of Education, Central People's Government

The national unified enrollment examination for higher education institutions in the summer of 1953 has come to an end. The National Higher Education Enrollment Committee will allocate and admit candidates according to the needs of the country, and the list of admitted candidates will be announced soon. I congratulate these students who are about to enter higher education institutions. Among the students who are about to enter higher education institutions, some will enter normal colleges (normal universities) or normal specialized schools. Here, I would like to offer some suggestions and talk to these students.

The task of higher normal schools is to cultivate secondary school teachers who have a foundation of Marxism-Leninism, advanced cultural and scientific levels, and specialized knowledge and skills in education, and who serve the people's education cause wholeheartedly, based on the new democratic education policy and in a manner that combines theory and practice. This task is very important.

Our country is undergoing various construction projects. Economic construction requires a large number of mid-level technicians, who are to be trained by secondary technical schools; primary education requires a large number of teachers, who are to be trained by secondary normal schools; and higher education institutions need secondary schools and worker-peasant rapid course middle schools to provide reserves of students. Since secondary schools are so important, the importance of higher normal education, which trains teachers for secondary schools, is not difficult to understand. Some people compare higher normal education to heavy industry in industrial construction, or to a working machine in a machine. These comparisons are very appropriate. This year, more than 70,000 students are enrolled in higher education institutions, the first being engineering, with 29,600 students, accounting for more than 42% of the total; the second being normal education, with 18,300 students, accounting for more than 26% of the total; followed by health, science, agriculture and forestry, liberal arts, finance and economics, sports, politics and law, and art. The enrollment plan for higher education institutions, carefully decided by the government, reflects the current needs of national construction and also shows the role of normal education in the cause of national construction.

As secondary school teachers, educating the younger generation, arming them with revolutionary ideas and general cultural and scientific knowledge, and enabling their physical and mental development to be comprehensive, laying the necessary foundation for entering vocational schools, higher education institutions, participating in industrial production, agricultural production, or other construction work, is a noble and difficult career. Just thinking about this is enough: in the all-encompassing treasure house of human culture and scientific knowledge in the world, precisely selecting what is most needed for modern life and most suitable for the age characteristics and personality characteristics of students, and effectively and systematically teaching them, so that young people's "minds are not filled with a pile of useless garbage, but are enriched with all the practical knowledge necessary for every educated person in modern times" (Lenin), this requires teachers to have such broad knowledge, excellent moral character, and skilled educational techniques. As Kalinin said, "Education is the most difficult undertaking. Excellent educators believe that education is not only a scientific undertaking, but also an artistic undertaking." Can such a noble and difficult undertaking be undertaken by bookworms or empty theorists? No, such an undertaking can only be undertaken by people's teachers who possess broad knowledge, excellent moral character, and skilled educational techniques. As people's teachers, it is necessary and entirely possible to continuously improve their political and ideological level and professional level in the practice of educating the younger generation, so that they have the conditions to become "experts." Therefore, all views that despise teaching work or consider it to have no future are clearly wrong.

We often hear young students say: "Go to where the motherland needs us!" This is a sentence with profound meaning. To the students who are about to enter higher normal schools, the motherland expects them to become excellent secondary school teachers and entrusts them with the glorious task of cultivating the younger generation. This is the need of national construction, and at the same time, it will not be unsuitable for the specific conditions of the students themselves. According to the "Regulations on the Enrollment of New Students in National Higher Education Institutions in the Summer of 1953" promulgated by the Central Higher Education Department and the Central Education Department, the National Higher Education Enrollment Committee will allocate students who have passed the examination according to the needs of the state, according to the grade of their scores, and with reference to the majors they have applied for; those who fail to be allocated according to the majors they have applied for will be appropriately allocated to their departments and schools according to the needs of enrollment and with reference to the conditions of the applicants. The needs of the country exist objectively, and the personality of the individual is also specifically expressed in the examination scores, which can also be said to be objective. Objective existence is decisive. If our subjective wishes and objective existence are harmoniously combined, that is very good; if contradictions occur between the subjective and the objective, then the only way to resolve the contradictions is to make our subjective conform to the objective, thereby promoting the development of objective existence. It should be understood that if an individual's ideals, aspirations, and interests are far from the requirements of the motherland and the people, then so-called ideals and aspirations become impractical fantasies and daydreams, and so-called interests become bad habits.

Since liberation, countless excellent teachers have emerged in the new China. Taking secondary schools alone, there are Comrade Qi Taichen, a teacher at Siping Normal School in Liaoxi Province, who displayed a spirit of hard work and took the lead in doing a good job in teaching; Comrade Huang Jiayuan, a teacher at Nanning No. 1 Middle School in Guangxi Province, who created the "Three-Sphere Instrument," overcame the difficulties of material conditions, and improved the quality of teaching; Comrade He Taoran, a teacher at Zhouzhi County Junior High School in Shaanxi Province, who modified the "Movable Key Organ" and promoted the widespread development of school music activities; and many other teachers who loved their work and achieved remarkable results. Their hard work has won the respect and praise of the government, the people, and young students. There are also many students studying in higher normal schools who are the backbone of future secondary school education and future excellent teachers. For example, the examples shown in the educational practice of Beijing Normal University in the second semester of 1952 are very touching. After the internship, some students said: "I can teach these happy children. These children will be the experts, engineers, and scientists who will build the motherland in the future... The motherland trusts me so much, and I feel great happiness! Therefore, I must answer the happiness given to me by the motherland with practical actions." Some students said: "When I first walked into the classroom, the students stood up and saluted. Every innocent and lively student revealed a desire for knowledge in their clever eyes. They sat upright and waited for me to lecture, which gave me great encouragement. At this time, my whole body was full of strength." These many excellent teachers and huge reserve forces have made the ranks of teachers increasingly strong, rapidly changing the face of secondary school education, thereby powerfully promoting the various construction undertakings of the motherland.

Students! I hope that you will learn from these excellent teachers and future excellent teachers, learn from their spirit of obeying the needs of the motherland and loving education work, resolutely and happily embark on your new learning positions, establish professional thoughts, and step up your studies, preparing to work hard to complete the glorious task of cultivating the younger generation!

Students! We have made so many demands on you, and at the same time, we are precisely expressing our respect. Let me end this article by quoting the words of the great educator Makarenko: "Our basic principle is always this: how can we make more demands on people, but at the same time, also show more respect for people. In fact, in our dialectic, the two are unified: when we make more demands on people, then the demand itself also includes our respect, precisely because we demand, precisely because they fulfill our demands, we show them respect."

### 欢迎将要进入高等师范学校的同学们

    欢迎将要进入高等师范学校的同学们
    中央人民政府教育部副部长  林礪儒
    一九五三年暑期全国高等学校统一招生考试工作已告结束，全国高等学校招生委员会按照国家需要分配录取考生，录取考生的名单将于最近公布。我为这些快要进入高等学校的同学们祝贺。在将要进入高等学校的同学中，有一部分是升入师范学院（师范大学）或师范专修科学校的。在这里，我愿意提出几点意见和这些同学们谈谈。
    高等师范学校的任务是根据新民主主义的教育方针，以理论和实际一致的方法，培养具有马克思列宁主义的基础、高级文化与科学水平和教育的专门知识与技能、全心全意为人民教育事业服务的中等学校师资。这个任务是非常重大的。
    我们的国家正在进行各项建设。经济建设需要大批中级技术人员，要由中等技术学校来培养；初等教育需要大批教师，要由中等师范学校来培养，高等学校的学生来源更需要中学和工农速成中学输送后备军。中等学校既如此重要，那么，培养中等学校师资的高等师范教育的重要性是不难理解的了。有人把高等师范教育比喻为工业建设中的重工业，比喻为机器中的工作母机，这些比喻都是很恰当的。今年高等学校招生七万多人，其中第一为工科，招生二万九千六百人，占总数百分之四十二强；第二为师范，招生一万八千三百人，占总数百分之二十六强；其次为卫生、理科、农林、文科、财经、体育、政法、艺术等。经过政府慎重考虑决定的高等学校招生任务，反映了当前国家建设的需要，也显示了师范教育在国家建设事业中所起的作用。
    作为中等学校教师，教育青年一代，以革命思想和普通文化科学知识武装他们，使他们的身心获得全面的发展，为升入专业学校、高等学校、参加工业生产、农业生产或其他建设工作打下必要的基础，这是一种崇高的也是艰难的事业。只要想想这一点就够了：在全世界人类文化科学知识的包罗万象的宝库中，精密地选择最为现代生活所需要，而又最适于学生年龄特点和个性特点的东西，有效地有系统地教导他们，使青少年们的“脑子里，不是被一堆无用的垃圾充塞着，而是为现代每个有学识的人所必备的一切实际知识所丰富着”（列宁），这需要教师具有怎样广博的学识、优良的道德品质和熟练的教育技巧。正如加里宁所说，“教育是一种最困难的事业。优秀教育家们认为，教育不仅是科学事业，而且是艺术事业。”这样崇高而又艰难的事业，难道是书呆子或空头理论家一类的人所能担当的么？不，这样的事业，只有具备广博的学识、优良的道德品质和熟练的教育技巧的人民教师才能担当起来。作为人民教师，在教育青年一代的实践中，不断地提高自己的政治思想水平和业务水平，使自己具备成为“专家”的条件，是必要的，也是完全可能的。因此，一切轻视教师工作或认为它是没有前途的看法显然都是错误的。
    我们常常听到青年同学们说：“到祖国需要的地方去！”这是一句含有深刻意义的话。对将要进入高等师范学校的同学们说，祖国期待他们成为优秀的中等学校教师，交给他们以培养青年一代的光荣任务。这是国家建设的需要，同时也不会不适合同学们个人的具体条件。根据中央高等教育部和中央教育部公布的“关于全国高等学校一九五三年暑期招考新生的规定”，全国高等学校招生委员会对考试成绩合格的同学，即根据国家需要，按成绩等第，参照所报志愿进行分配；其未能依所报志愿分配者，则根据招生需要，参照报考同学的条件，适当分配其系科及学校。国家的需要客观地存在着，个人的个性也具体地表现于考试成绩，也可说是客观的。客观存在具有决定性，如果我们的主观愿望和客观存在和谐地结合，那是很好的；如果主观和客观之间发生矛盾，那么，解决矛盾的方法只有使我们的主观服从客观，从而推动客观存在向前发展。要知道，个人的理想、志愿、兴趣，如果与祖国和人民的要求有很大距离，那末，所谓理想、志愿就成为不切实际的幻想、空想，而所谓兴趣就成为不好的性癖了。
    解放后的新中国，涌现了无数优秀的教师，单以中等学校来说，如发挥艰苦卓绝精神、带头搞好教学的辽西省四平师范教师齐泰辰同志；创制“三球仪”、克服物质条件的困难、提高教学质量的广西省南宁市第一中学教师黄家元同志；改制“活键风琴”、推动学校音乐活动广泛展开的陕西省盩厔县初中教师何陶然同志和其他许多热爱自己工作、获得显著成绩的教师，他们辛勤劳苦的工作，获得了政府、人民和青年学生的尊敬和赞扬。还有正在高等师范学校学习的许多同学，他们是未来中等学校教育工作的骨干，未来的优秀教师，如北京师范大学一九五二年度第二学期教育实习中表现出来的事例，就使人非常感动。经过实习，有的同学说：“我能教这些幸福的孩子，这些孩子就是将来建设祖国的专家、工程师、科学家……。祖国这样地信任我，我也感到了莫大的幸福！因此，我一定要以实际行动来回答祖国给予我的幸福。”有的同学说：“当我第一次走进教室时，同学们起立、行礼，每一个天真活泼的学生，在他们聪明伶俐的眼睛里，都透露着求知的欲望。他们端端正正地坐着等我讲课，给了我很大的鼓舞，这时我全身充满了力量。”这许多优秀的教师和巨大的后备力量，使教师的队伍日益壮大，使中等学校教育的面貌迅速改变，从而有力地推动祖国的各项建设事业。
    同学们！我希望你们向这些优秀教师和未来的优秀教师学习，学习他们服从祖国需要、热爱教育工作的精神，坚决地、愉快地走上自己的新的学习岗位，树立专业思想，加紧学习，准备为完成培养青年一代的光荣任务而努力！
    同学们！我们对你们提出这样多的要求，同时也正是表示了我们的尊重。让我在这里引用伟大的教育家马卡连柯的话结束这篇文章吧：“我们的基本原则永远是这样的：如何能对人提出更多的要求，但同时，也提出如何对人更多的尊敬。实际说来，这一点，在我们的辩证法里，两者是统一的：当我们对人多多提出要求的时候，那末，这种要求的本身也包括了我们的尊敬，正因为我们要求，正是因为他履行我们的要求，我们才对他表示尊重。”
