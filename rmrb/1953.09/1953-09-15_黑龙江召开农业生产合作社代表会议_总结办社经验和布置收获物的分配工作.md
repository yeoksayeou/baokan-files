    Heilongjiang Holds Representative Meeting of Agricultural Production Cooperatives
    Summarizing Experience in Running Cooperatives and Arranging Distribution of Harvested Goods
    The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently convened a representative meeting of agricultural production cooperatives for the entire province. In addition to summarizing the experiences of pilot agricultural production cooperatives in various regions during the first half of this year, the meeting also made advance arrangements for the autumn harvest distribution work of agricultural production cooperatives. The meeting pointed out: Doing a good job in the distribution of harvested goods is an important link in consolidating agricultural production cooperatives. During the autumn harvest, key points should first be selected for distribution experiments to gain experience. Then, accountants of agricultural production cooperatives and cadres at the county and district levels who are responsible for distribution work should be collectively trained to determine unified distribution principles, teach distribution methods, and then carry out universal distribution. However, the wheat already harvested by the cooperatives, after deducting agricultural taxes and next year's seeds, should be allowed to be pre-borrowed based on the existing "workdays" of male and female members, and then finally settled during the autumn harvest accounting to meet the autumn needs of the members.
    The meeting also put forward three principles as the basis for doing a good job in distribution: First, in the distribution, it is necessary to implement the principle of both ensuring reasonable compensation for the private means of production of the members and adhering to labor dividends as the main factor. Second, it is necessary to implement the principle of ensuring that members have more actual income. Therefore, in addition to retaining agricultural tax amounts and next year's seeds, fodder, and no more than five percent of the public welfare fund and accumulation fund, all grain should be distributed to the members, and no unified sale of grain should be carried out to purchase large amounts of public property and set up large stalls. Third, it is necessary to implement the principle of democratic distribution: Distribution must be discussed and agreed upon by all members, and carried out under the supervision of all members.

    黑龙江召开农业生产合作社代表会议
    总结办社经验和布置收获物的分配工作
    中共黑龙江省委会最近召开了全省农业生产合作社代表会议。会议除总结今年上半年各地试办农业生产合作社的经验外，还提前布置了农业生产合作社的秋收分配工作。会议指出：做好收获物的分配工作，是巩固农业生产合作社的重要一环。秋收中首先选择重点进行分配试验，取得经验，然后集训农业生产合作社的会计人员和县、区领导分配工作的干部，确定统一分配原则，教会分配方法，再行普遍分配。但各社已收的小麦，除留下农业税和明年的籽种外，应一律准予按男女社员现有的“劳动日”数预借，秋收结账时再最后找清，以满足社员的秋季需要。
    会议并提出了三条原则，作为搞好分配工作的依据：第一，在分配中，要贯彻既保证社员私人生产资料取得合理代价又坚持劳动力分红为主的原则。其次，必须贯彻保证社员有更多实际收入的原则，因此除保留农业税额和明年的籽种、草料以及不超过百分之五的公益金、公积金外，应将全部粮食分配给社员，不得统一卖粮，购买大量公共财产和摆大摊子。第三，必须贯彻民主分配的原则：分配必须经过全体社员讨论同意，并在全体社员监督下进行。（据新华社讯）
