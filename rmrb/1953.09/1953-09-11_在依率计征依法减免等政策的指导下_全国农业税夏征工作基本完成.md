    Under the Guidance of Policies Such as Tax Collection According to Law and Legal Tax Reduction and Exemption, the National Summer Agricultural Tax Collection Work is Basically Completed

    [By this newspaper] From the beginning of June, twenty-two provinces and six cities across the country carried out the 1953 summer agricultural tax collection work. At present, with the exception of the early rice areas of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian, and the Northeast region due to later summer harvests, most of the wheat-producing areas such as Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Sichuan have basically completed the summer tax collection work.

    This year's summer agricultural tax collection work, due to the attention of leaders at all levels, underwent in-depth publicity and education, and implemented the collection policy. As most wheat-producing areas suffered from varying degrees of frost damage this year, all localities earnestly carried out legal tax reduction and exemption work during collection. Some areas' farmers originally had concerns, such as non-disaster area farmers thinking that if agricultural taxes were reduced and exempted for disaster areas, would the burden on non-disaster areas be increased? Some middle peasants thought that if poor peasants suffered disasters they could get agricultural tax reduction and exemption, but if middle peasants suffered disasters, could they also get tax reduction and exemption? However, these concerns were dispelled due to the correct implementation of the reduction and exemption policy.

    All localities paid great attention to the work of transporting grain into storage. Many provinces and cities have accepted the experience and lessons of last year, formulated methods for the safe storage of public grain, emphasized safety first, strengthened safety education and the organization of grain transportation and storage; stipulated the conditions for manpower and animal power to participate in transportation; carried out necessary repairs to roads, bridges and warehouses; and organized medical treatment and reception work for grain transporters and animals. Therefore, casualties of people and animals in this year's summer tax collection were greatly reduced compared to last year.

    There are two main reasons for the above-mentioned achievements: first, the Party committees and people's governments at all levels attached importance to the summer tax collection work, and the policy was clearly explained. In many areas, under the unified leadership of the local Party and government, the policy was conveyed in a relatively thorough manner, combined with the anti-bureaucracy struggle, checked at each level, the policy was explained, a good work style was established, and specific methods for implementing the policy were stipulated. Some areas also conducted policy tests for cadres. In the process of carrying out the summer tax collection work, some areas adopted the method of typical experiments and gradually promoted them. The directors of the finance departments of many provinces and responsible cadres of the Party committees led working groups to go deep into districts and townships to check the implementation of the policy. Second, after the wheat-producing areas suffered disasters, the Party and government organs fully led the peasants to produce and provide disaster relief, which greatly reduced the degree of wheat damage. In April and May this year, wheat disasters were relatively common in Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, Anhui and other provinces, but after rescue, the disaster situation was greatly reduced. Many farmers were pleasantly surprised.

    Although the summer tax collection work in most areas has achieved the above-mentioned achievements this year, some serious shortcomings still occurred in a few areas. In some places, the policy was not fully implemented, so that individual farmers did not receive the due reduction and exemption, resulting in an excessive burden. A small number of district and village cadres failed to follow the mass line well, and there was still a coercive work style. Some areas did not seriously implement the policy of tax collection according to the rate and legal tax reduction and exemption, and the task was divided equally, resulting in a phenomenon of hard squeezing that violated the policy. Although the local Party and government organs promptly checked and conducted serious handling, it has caused adverse effects among the masses. In addition, some areas did not conduct in-depth publicity of the policy, and even some cadres made wrong publicity, causing ideological concerns among the masses; in addition, they did not conduct in-depth investigations, and some people exaggerated the disaster situation when reporting for reduction and exemption. There were also individual areas that one-sidedly emphasized "reducing the burden on the people," looking for disasters even when there were none, and implementing "reduction and exemption" for prosperous farmers, so that the masses reflected that: "This year's harvest is considered a disaster, when will it not be considered a disaster!" The result of doing so has reduced the state's due financial revenue and created difficulties for future work.

    In the work of transporting grain into storage, although there has been great improvement, according to reports from various places, accidents of human and animal casualties continue to occur. The reasons for these phenomena are, on the one hand, due to the fact that the summer tax grain storage is in the dog days, hot and rainy, but on the other hand, it is because many cadres still have a bureaucratic work style, are indifferent to the lives of the masses, and are paralyzed; and the work of safe storage is limited to general calls, lacking specific organizational work.

    All localities have made timely checks and handling of the problems and deviations that occurred in this year's summer tax collection work. Some areas are further checking and summarizing in order to improve during the autumn tax collection.

### 在依率计征依法减免等政策的指导下  全国农业税夏征工作基本完成

    在依率计征依法减免等政策的指导下
    全国农业税夏征工作基本完成
    【本报讯】从六月初开始，全国有二十二个省六个市进行了一九五三年农业税夏征工作。目前除广东、广西、福建早稻地区和东北区因夏收较晚外，江苏、山东、河南、安徽、河北、山西、陕西、四川等产麦地区，大部已基本结束夏征工作。
    今年农业税夏征工作，由于各级领导的重视，经过了深入的宣传教育，贯彻了征收政策。由于今年大部分产麦地区曾遭受不同程度的冻灾，各地在征收中认真地进行了依法减免工作。有些地区的农民本来有顾虑，如非灾区农民认为给灾区减免了农业税，是否会给非灾区加重？有些中农认为贫农受了灾能减免农业税，中农受了灾是否也能减免？但由于正确地贯彻了减免政策，打消了这种顾虑。
    各地对运粮入库工作都很重视。不少省、市都接受去年的经验教训，制定了公粮安全入库办法，强调了安全第一，加强了安全教育工作和运粮入库的组织工作；规定了人力、畜力参加运输的条件；对道路、桥梁和仓库作了必要的检修；组织了对运粮人、畜的医疗和招待工作。因此，今年夏征中人畜伤亡事件，比去年大大减少。
    取得上述成绩的主要原因有两点：第一是中共各级党委和人民政府重视夏征工作，政策交代得明确。许多地区，在当地党政统一领导下，对政策方针进行了比较深入的传达，结合反官僚主义斗争，逐级进行检查，交代政策，树立优良的工作作风，并规定了贯彻政策的具体方法。有的地区还对干部进行了政策测验。在进行夏征工作中，有些地区采用了典型试验逐步推广的方法，不少省的财政厅长和中共党委负责干部带领工作组深入区、乡，检查政策执行情况。第二是产麦区受灾之后，党、政机关全力领导农民生产救灾，大大减轻了小麦受灾程度。今年四、五月间，江苏、山东、河南、安徽等省小麦受灾较为普遍，但经过抢救后，灾情大为减轻。许多农民喜出望外。
    今年大部地区夏征工作虽然取得上述成绩，但少数地区依然发生了一些严重的缺点。有的地方对政策贯彻不够，使个别农民未能得到应有的减免，以致负担过重。少数区村干部未能很好地走群众路线，仍存在着强迫命令的工作作风。有的地区未认真执行依率计征、依法减免的政策，平均摊派任务，以致发生了违反政策的硬挤的现象。虽经当地党政机关及时检查并进行严肃的处理，但在群众中已造成不良影响。还有些地区对政策宣传不深入，甚至某些干部作了错误的宣传，引起了群众思想上的顾虑；加以未作深入调查，有些群众在报减免时夸大灾情。还有个别地区片面强调“减轻民负”，无灾找灾，对于丰收的农民也实行“减免”，以致群众反映说：“今年的年景还算有灾，啥时候才算没灾呢！”这样作的结果，减少了国家应有的财政收入，并给今后工作造成了困难。
    在运粮入库工作方面，虽有了很大的改进，但据各地报告，人、畜伤亡事故仍然不断发生。这些现象造成的原因，一方面固然是由于夏征公粮入库正逢伏天，酷热多雨，但另一方面，却是由于不少干部还存在着官僚主义作风，对群众性命漠不关心，麻痹大意；对安全入库工作只限于一般号召，缺乏具体的组织工作。
    各地对今年夏征工作中发生的问题和偏向，都作了及时的检查与处理。有些地区正在进一步检查，进行总结，以便在秋征时加以改进。
