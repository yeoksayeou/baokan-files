Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 11th: Since the government of the German Democratic Republic announced the implementation of its new policies and the results of the Soviet-German Moscow talks were published, workers and farmers in Democratic Germany have widely engaged in increasing production and practicing economy, creating remarkable achievements. They pledge to fulfill their annual production plans ahead of schedule.

    Miners at the August Bebel furnace of the "Wilhelm Pieck" steel combine in Mansfeld completed 107.6 percent of their production quota in July, reaching the highest production volume since 1945.

    Miners at the Mitschurin brown coal mine exceeded their production quota by 8.3 percent in July and by 21.2 percent on August 9th. They also pledged to increase the annual production of brown coal by one million tons and the annual production of briquettes by 70,000 tons above the original plan.

    Max Teistler, a worker at the "Deutsche Kohle" mine in Oesnis, completed his annual production plan on August 8th. He doubled his daily production quota by using a method of thorough preparation before starting work, despite difficult geographical conditions.

    Nine hundred workers in the mineral department of the "Walter Ulbricht" chemical plant in Leuna and workers at the Niedersachswerfen gypsum factory jointly launched a competition with the goal of overproducing 8,300 tons of chemical fertilizer this year to support the government's new policies. They also pledged to complete their annual production plans by December 21st – the birthday of the great Stalin.

    Production teams and workers at the "Karl Marx" coal mine in Zwickau have put forward guarantees for personal responsibility in protecting machinery, tools, and mine safety. The "October 7th" production team at the mine pledged to complete its annual production plan by November 15th.

    Due to efforts to increase production and practice economy, workers at the "Buna Synthetic Rubber Factory" completed 104.4 percent of their production plan in the second quarter, reduced regular expenses by 6.15 percent, and increased labor productivity by 4 percent.

    At the Riesa steel plant, the efficiency of goods delivery in July increased by 35 percent compared to June, and the number of vehicle damage incidents was reduced by half due to the establishment of a goods distribution system.

    Engineers and technicians at the Brandenburg steel plant, in order to express their support for the results of the Soviet-German talks, pledged to adjust the fuel consumption of open-hearth furnaces to reduce the amount of briquettes needed to refine each ton of pig iron to an average of 370 kilograms per year. The twenty members of the "Construction" team in the plant's brown coal department pledged to increase their monthly production quota by 25,000 tons starting in September.

    Workers at the Silbitz "Steel Foundry and Machine Manufacturing Plant" in Thuringia pledged to complete the annual amount of molten steel in eleven months. The factory's production volume has increased fivefold from 1947 to 1952.

    Workers at the state-owned motorcycle repair shop in the Democratic sector of Berlin wrote a letter to Johannes Dieckmann, Chairman of the People's Chamber of Democratic Germany, on August 18th, pledging to complete the 1953 production plan by October 30th.

    Workers at the Scherzeide synthetic factory put forward 297 rationalization proposals for improvement work during a two-month competition. Adopting these proposals will save two million marks annually. In the artificial fiber industry, workers in Democratic Germany have recently completed several important inventions, including: the invention of "Parlon" and "Telelon" glass fibers, which are stronger than "Nylon," and the invention of "Wolollon," an artificial fiber product that resembles wool in appearance and quality but is stronger. "Parlon" glass fiber, when woven into textiles with other cotton, wool, and rayon, can increase the strength of the original fabric by four times, and it can also replace pig bristles and surgical catgut.

    The production enthusiasm of agricultural workers and farmers is also constantly increasing. Tractor driver Ernst Waoschkun has already completed 200 percent of his annual production plan, and he has challenged his colleagues, personally guaranteeing to plow at least 1,000 hectares of land by December 21st. Members of the "Philipp Müller" agricultural production cooperative wrote a letter to President Pieck, pledging to increase the production of pigs, milk, eggs, and grain by learning from the advanced production experience of the Soviet Union. They had already completed their production plans for grain, legumes, oilseeds, meat, milk, and eggs by August 15th.

    工人、农民纷纷保证提前完成全年生产计划
    【新华社十一日讯】柏林消息：自从德意志民主共和国政府宣布执行新方针以及苏德莫斯科会谈结果公布以来，民主德国工人与农民广泛展开了增产节约，创造出显著的成绩。他们保证要提前完成全年的生产计划。
    曼斯费尔德的“威廉·皮克”钢铁康宾纳奥古斯特·倍倍尔熔炉的矿工，七月份完成了生产定额的百分之一百零七点六，达到了自一九四五年以来的最高生产额。
    密欣褐煤厂的矿工七月份超过了生产定额百分之八点三，并在八月九日这一天超过每日生产定额百分之二十一点二。他们并保证将褐煤的年产量比原订计划提高一百万吨，块煤的年产量提高七万吨。
    欧斯尼斯“德意志煤矿”工人马克斯·泰斯特勒在八月八日就完成了全年的生产计划。他在困难的地理条件下，使用在开始工作前预先进行彻底的准备工作的方法，把每日生产定额提高了一倍。
    “瓦尔特·乌布利希”化学工厂洛埃那矿物部门的九百个工人和尼德撒克斯维尔芬石膏工厂的工人联合展开了一个竞赛，目标是今年超额生产八千三百吨化学肥料，以支持政府的新方针。他们同时保证在十二月二十一日——伟大的斯大林的诞辰，完成全年生产计划。
    兹维考“卡尔·马克思”煤矿的生产小队与工人们提出了个人负责保护机器、工具和矿井安全的保证。该矿的“十月七日”生产小队保证在十一月十五日完成全年生产计划。
    “布那人造橡胶工厂”的工人由于展开了增产节约的努力，第二季度完成了生产计划百分之一百零四点四，经常费开支减少了百分之六点一五，而劳动生产率提高了百分之四。
    在里埃萨钢铁厂，由于建立了派送货物制度，七月份的运货效率比六月份提高了百分之三十五，车辆损坏事件减少了一半。
    布兰登堡钢铁厂的工程师与技术人员为了表示支持苏德会谈结果，保证调节平炉的燃料用量，以便把炼每吨生铁所需要的块煤用量减少到一年平均三百七十公斤。该厂褐煤部“建设”小队的二十个队员保证从九月份起把每月生产定额提高二万五千吨。
