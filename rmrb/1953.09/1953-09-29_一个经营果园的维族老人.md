    A Uyghur Elder Running an Orchard
    By our reporter, Zhu Bo
    On the northwestern border of our motherland, the land is so vast that in some places you can travel for dozens of kilometers without finding a single household. Sometimes you have to climb over a high mountain or cross a deep valley to find someone living there; but even in these places there may only be one or two households, who rely on growing fruit trees and raising bees to make a living. The Uyghur elder Balati is one such person.
    Balati lives in a mountain gully that stretches for more than forty kilometers – people call this gully "Salabaoketing Gully." In this deep valley, aside from water for livestock, it is difficult for Kazakh herders to find pasture. Only some substandard shrubs grow on both sides of the gully. However, there is a very beautiful place here, namely the orchard of the Uyghur elder Balati. It is planted with various fruit trees and flowers such as刺梅 (prickly plum) and night-blooming jasmine; dozens of pigeons raised by the elder often fly over the orchard. People passing by here all stop at this place to rest for a while before continuing on their way.
    Balati has put a lot of effort into this orchard. He often forgets to eat and sleep because of the orchard. One night, he heard the sound of sheep bleating in his sleep and thought that a flock of sheep had broken into his orchard. He threw on his clothes and ran out, inspecting the orchard, but found nothing but the sound of gurgling streams. Therefore, the Kazakh herders nearby all say that the elder is obsessed with fruit trees.
    At noon in July, the weather is as hot as if it were on fire. Uyghur herders drive their herds into the depths of the forest; Uyghur farmers return indoors and sit on carpets to drink tea; travelers also rest in the shade of trees, waiting to set off again in the afternoon. But at this time, Balati elder, regardless of the heat, is spraying pesticide on the fruit trees. After spraying for a while, he stops to observe carefully. When he sees those pests lying on the leaves, struggling weakly, he smiles with satisfaction and says to himself: "This pesticide is really effective. If it were in the past, these fruit trees, planted for less than a year, would have been eaten bare by them long ago. Those damned bugs are as hateful as Sheng Shicai!"
    "Dad, Mom is calling you to come and have tea!" Balati's youngest son shouted as he ran.
    The elder seemed not to have heard his child's words, and continued his work. When he felt impatient, he straightened his back and replied, "Wait a little longer."
    The child felt dissatisfied with his father's attitude, walked up to him and said: "Every time I call you, you always say 'wait a little longer'. Mom has told you several times, fruit can't be eaten as a meal!"
    Balati saw his son's tense little face, smiled and said: "Little Sayidahon, how come you have the same temper as your mother, you get so anxious that your face turns red when you speak, how can you get angry at your dad?" Then he put his arm around his son, pointed to the fruit trees and said: "Look, these fruit trees will bear fruit next year, then you and your mother will never get angry again!" He led his son through the fruit trees.
    "This is the famous red apple tree moved from the Ili River Valley. The fruit it bears is large, juicy, and sweet. This is..."
    The child was fascinated by his father's words, his eyes turning with Balati's fingers.
    Why does Balati take care of the orchard so painstakingly? There is a reason for that.
    More than twenty years ago, this place, like other places in Salabaoketing Gully, was full of scattered stones, except for a small stream. Balati and his wife moved here from outside and began to clear the rocks and plant fruit trees. However, every time the fruit trees were planted, they were soon eaten bare by passing livestock and wild animals. In order to prevent the livestock and wild animals from harming the orchard, Balati and his wife built a wall around the orchard and inserted branches on top of the wall; they also repaired the canals to divert water for irrigation. The fruit trees grew luxuriantly, bringing happiness to Balati's family.
    But soon, a new disaster loomed. When the young fruit trees had just borne their first fruit, Sheng Shicai's township head (i.e. township chief) rode over on horseback and ordered Balati and his wife to prepare fodder for fifty horses for Sheng Shicai's cavalry which would be arriving soon, and warned Balati and his wife to take good care of them. How could the township head's order be violated? Balati immediately ran to the distant mountains and cut bundles of green grass with a sickle, while his wife took out the stored corn to prepare.
    About two hours later, the sound of horses' hooves came from the northern deep valley, and dust rose into the air. The herders nearby nervously waved their whips, driving their herds into the deep mountains. After a while, bandits wearing their hats askew and carrying their guns upside down came running.
    One of the bandits in front asked Balati fiercely: "Where is the fodder that the township head ordered you to prepare?" Balati led him to the open space by the stream. When the bandit saw the withered green grass under the sun, he angrily asked Balati: "Can livestock eat such grass?" When Balati was about to argue, the bandit began to curse, and asked sternly: "If the horses run away, can you take responsibility?"
    The bandits drove the herd of horses into the orchard. As soon as the horses entered the orchard, they jumped and leaped, eating all the leaves, tender branches, and unripe fruits. Balati's wife was so anxious that she took a stick to drive away the livestock, but was beaten severely by the bandits.
    Balati saw his humiliated loved one and his beloved orchard being destroyed, and he trembled with anger. He was a man of integrity and could not tolerate such humiliation. He protested to the bandits. However, the protest was ineffective and instead suffered abuse.
    From then on, the fruit trees withered, and the painstakingly built walls were washed away by rain.
    The sound of liberation gunfire rang out, and the bandits, like hunted beasts, were defeated by the People's Liberation Army. Balati learned from Kazakh herders that the times had changed, and the people had gained power. He rekindled new hope for his orchard. In the second year after liberation, Balati traveled dozens of miles to attend a mass meeting. Comrades from the county people's government work team called on everyone to work hard in production to improve their lives. The villagers unanimously replied: "We are liberated, now we must work hard to create our happy lives." The representative of the Kazakh herders reported on the plan to develop animal husbandry at the meeting. The herder representative said: "In the past, the Kuomintang reactionaries destroyed the fruits of our labor; now, Chairman Mao has liberated us, allowing us to work in peace." Balati elder listened and said to himself:
  "That's right, in the past we could never satisfy the bandits' greed!" Balati returned home and began to repair the ruined orchard, and bought fruit tree seedlings from the Ili River Valley.
    Now, the fruit tree seedlings have all survived and are growing very vigorously. People passing through the orchard all praised Balati for his good work, saying that his fruit trees were neatly trimmed. The elder pointed to the mountains and said with a smile, "I want to challenge the Kazakhs!" (Attached picture)

    一个经营果园的维族老人
    本报记者　朱波
    在祖国的西北边境上，土地是那么辽阔，有些地方，你就是走上几十公里也找不到一户人家，有时，你得爬过一座高山，或者穿过一道深谷，才能遇到有人住的地方；但是，这种地方也只有一两户人家，他们依靠种果树、养蜂来维持生活。维吾尔族老人巴拉提就是这样的一户人家。
    巴拉提住在一条长达四十多公里的山沟里，——人们称这山沟为“撒拉宝琴沟”。在这个深谷里，除牲畜的饮水以外，哈萨克族牧民很难找到牧草。沟的两旁只是长着一些不成材的灌木。但是，这里却有一个很美丽的地方，那就是维族老人巴拉提的果园。里面种植着各种果树和刺梅、夜来香等鲜花；果园上空经常飞翔着几十只老人喂养的鸽子。路过这里的人都要在这个地方停下来，休息一会再走。
    巴拉提曾为这个果园费了很多心血。他常常为了果园而忘记吃饭睡觉。有一个夜晚，他在睡梦里听到羊叫的声音，就以为是羊群钻进了他的果园。他披着衣裳跑出去，向园中探视了一番，除了潺潺的溪水声，他什么也没有发现。因此，附近的哈萨克族牧民都说老人被果树迷住了。
    七月的中午，天气炎热得像火烤似的。维族牧民都把牧群赶进森林的深处；维族农民回到室内，坐在地毯上喝茶；行路的人，也都歇在树荫下，等午后再上路。可是巴拉提老人在这时候，却不顾炎热，向果树喷射着杀虫药水。他喷了一阵，就停下来仔细地观察一下。他一看到那些躺在树叶上无力挣扎的害虫，就满意地笑了，自言自语地说：“这药水真管用，要是在过去，这些种植不到一年的果树早就被它们啃光了。该死的虫子像盛世才一样可恶！”
    “大大（爸爸），阿娜（妈妈）叫你快喝茶去！”巴拉提的小儿子边跑边喊着。
    老人好像没有听到孩子的话似的，继续进行着自己的工作。当他感觉不耐烦的时候，才直了直腰回答一声：“再等一等。”
    孩子对父亲的态度感到了不满，走到跟前说：“每次叫你，你都是说‘等一等’，阿娜说过你好几次了，果子也不能当饭吃呀！”
    巴拉提看到儿子的紧绷着的小脸，笑起来了，说：“小撒依达洪，你怎么长得和你阿娜一样的鬼脾气，一说话就急得脸红脖子粗，怎么能向着大大发脾气呢？”随着就把儿子搂过来，指着果树说：“看，这些果树明年就要结果子了，那时你和你阿娜再也不会发脾气了！”他领着儿子在果树间走着。
    “这是从伊犁河谷移来的有名的红苹果树，它结的果，个大汁多，味又甘美。这是……”
    孩子被他爸爸的话迷住了，两只眼睛随着巴拉提的手指打转转。
    巴拉提为什么那样苦心地照管果园呢？那是有理由的。
    二十多年前，这里和撒拉宝琴沟的其它地方一样，除去一道不大的溪流而外，满是零乱的石头。巴拉提夫妇从外边移到了这里，开始收拾乱石，种植果树。但是，每次果树种上不久，就被过往的牲畜、野兽啃光了。巴拉提夫妇为了防止牲畜和野兽的侵害，就在果园的四周修起一道围墙，并在墙上面插上了树枝；又整修了水渠，以便引水灌溉。果树茂盛地生长起来了，它们给巴拉提家带来了快乐。
    但是不久，新的灾难又临头了。在幼小的果树刚结了第一次果子的时候，盛世才的乡约（即乡长）骑着马跑来，命令巴拉提夫妇为即将来到的盛世才的马队准备五十匹马的草料，并警告巴拉提夫妇要小心侍候他们。乡约的命令那能违背呀，巴拉提马上跑到远处山头上用镰刀割了一捆一捆的青草，他的女人则把收藏着的包谷拿出来准备着。
    约莫两个钟头以后，北边深谷中传来了马蹄声，空中扬起了尘土。附近的牧人都紧张地挥动着鞭子，把牧群赶往深山里。一会儿，歪戴着帽子倒背着枪的匪徒们跑来了。
    走在前面的一个匪徒恶狠狠地问巴拉提：“乡约叫你准备的草料在那里？”巴拉提就引他到溪水边的空地上。匪徒一看到太阳底下的枯萎的青草就愤怒地问巴拉提：“牲口能吃这样的草吗？”巴拉提正要申辩的时候，匪徒就骂起来了，厉声问道：“马跑了你敢负责吗？”
    匪徒们就把马群赶进果园里。马群一进果园，又蹦又跳，把树叶、嫩枝和没有成熟的果子都啃光了。巴拉提的女人急得拿了一根棍子去赶那些牲畜，却遭了匪徒们的一顿痛打。
    巴拉提看到了被凌辱的亲人以及被破坏了的心爱的果园，气得混身发抖。他是个有血气的人，决不能忍受这种凌辱。他向匪徒们提出了抗议。可是，抗议没有发生效力，反而遭受了殴辱。
    从此，果树都枯死了，苦心修筑起来的围墙也都被雨水冲塌了。
    解放的炮声响了，匪徒们像被追赶着的野兽一样，被人民解放军打垮了，巴拉提从哈萨克牧民那里知道时代变了，人民取得了政权，他对自己的果园又燃起了新的希望。解放后的第二年，有一次巴拉提跑了几十里地参加一个群众大会，县人民政府工作组的同志，号召大家努力生产，改善自己的生活。乡民一致回答：“解放了，现在要好好生产，创造我们幸福的生活。”哈萨克的牧民代表，在会上报告了发展牧畜业的计划。牧民代表说：“过去，国民党反动派破坏我们的劳动成果；现在，毛主席解放了我们，使我们能在安静的日子里进行劳动。”巴拉提老人听了，自言自语地说：
  “说的对，过去我们怎样也满足不了匪徒们的贪欲！”巴拉提回到家里，就开始修复被糟踏的果园，并从伊犁河谷买来果树苗。
    现在，果树苗都活过来了，而且长得很茁壮。经过果园的人都称赞巴拉提劳动好，说他的果树修理的整齐。老人却向山上指了指笑着说：“我要和哈萨克人挑战哩！”（附图片）
