Helping Farmers Overcome Difficulties and Guarantee Completion of Procurement Plan
Major Peanut Producing Areas in Hebei Province Launch Advance Purchase Work

    Peanut advance purchase work has been launched in major peanut producing areas of Hebei Province. Hebei Province is one of the main peanut producing areas. This year, the growth of most peanuts is good. Except for some areas affected by flooding, a bumper harvest is generally expected. Because Hebei Province suffered from drought last year, resulting in reduced peanut production, farmers in the producing areas have been affected to a certain extent in production and life. Therefore, at this time of year when the old crops are running out and the new crops are not yet ready, farmers face many difficulties in their lives that must be resolved quickly.

    In order to meet the urgent needs of farmers, the Hebei Provincial People's Government, with the approval of the Central People's Government, has launched peanut advance purchase work in key peanut producing areas of the province. This advance purchase is being carried out by the state-owned Hebei Provincial Oil Company and its agencies at all levels, in conjunction with local administrations, through supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels. The advance purchase method is for local cooperatives to sign advance purchase contracts directly with farmers in the producing areas. A deposit of 30% of the current local market price of peanut kernels will be paid temporarily. The delivery date is generally stipulated from November 15th of this year to January 15th of next year. When the goods are received, the balance will be paid after settlement based on the market price standard of the day, "pricing according to value." The advance deposit already paid will be deducted from the payment for the goods without interest.

    The peanut advance purchase work not only solves the current production and living difficulties of farmers, but also protects the production interests of farmers. For example, some particularly poor farmers in Chaigezhuang in the Second District of Luan County were preparing to use immature tender corn as food rations. Now, with the peanut advance purchase, the farmers' food shortage has been solved, and there will be no waste of grain. In Dingxian County, due to the lack of food, a few speculators prepaid for peanuts from farmers at low prices, reducing the price of peanuts that could be sold for at least 900 yuan or more per kilogram after harvest to 600 yuan or even lower, thereby obtaining huge profits. Now that the state has advance purchases, farmers can avoid this loss.

    While carrying out the advance purchase, the Hebei Provincial People's Government has also notified state-owned specialized companies in various places to prepare sufficient materials to meet the production and living needs of farmers. (Zhang Bingqian, et al.)

### 帮助农民渡过困难保证完成收购计划  河北省主要花生产区展开预购工作

    帮助农民渡过困难保证完成收购计划
    河北省主要花生产区展开预购工作
    河北省各主要花生产区展开花生预购工作。河北省是花生的主要产区之一。今年绝大部分花生生长情况良好，除部分地区受涝外，一般可望丰收。由于去年河北省各地曾受旱灾，花生减产，产区农民在生产和生活上受到一定的影响，所以在目前青黄不接时，农民生活上有不少的困难，必须迅速解决。
    河北省人民政府为了适应农民的迫切需要，特报经中央人民政府批准，在该省花生主要产区，重点展开花生预购工作。这次预购是由国营河北省油脂公司及其各级机构负责，结合各地行政通过各级供销合作社进行的。预购办法是由各地合作社直接向产区农民签订预购合同。暂照目前各地花生米牌价，付给预购数量百分之三十的定金。收货日期一般规定自本年十一月十五日起到明年一月十五日止。收货时按照当天的牌价标准“按值论价”结算后，补付余款。已经预付的定金无息扣抵货款。
    花生预购工作不但解决了农民目前生产和生活上的困难，同时还保障了农民的生产利益。如滦县第二区柴各庄的有些特别困难的农民，他们准备用不成熟的嫩苞米充做口粮，现在有了花生预购，解决了农民食粮困难，就不致浪费粮食了。在定县区，若干农户因缺食粮，少数投机商人向农民低价预收花生，把收获后至少可卖九百元以上一斤的花生，压低到六百元或以低于六百元的价钱定下来，从中获得暴利。现在国家有了预购，就可使农民避免这种损失。
    在预购同时，河北省人民政府还通知各地国营专业公司准备充足的物资，满足农民生产和生活上的需要。    （张秉谦等）
