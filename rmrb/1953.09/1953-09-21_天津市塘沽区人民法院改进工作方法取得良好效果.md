    The People's Court of Tanggu District, Tianjin, Improves Working Methods and Achieves Good Results
    Letter from the Correspondence Group of the People's Court of Tanggu District, Tianjin: After the judicial reform movement and the study of the resolutions and documents of the Second National Judicial Conference, our court adopted the mass line working method and handled 829 cases, achieving good results.
    Based on the specific conditions of Tanggu District, our court established three trial groups to handle criminal and civil cases in the three regions of Xinhe Suburbs, Tanggu, and Dagu Beizhen. They are also responsible for answering public inquiries, conducting legal education, and implementing post-trial enforcement. The trial groups established a circuit trial system, rotating daily to various places to resolve the public's disputes on the spot. The family dispute between Kan Yuzhen and Zhou Enzhen in Beitang was resolved satisfactorily through the timely invitation of mass representatives to participate in mediation by the circuit court. Afterwards, many people reflected: The People's Court is truly working for the people.
    When handling cases, we emphasize going deep into the masses, conducting investigations and research, and overcoming the old practice of simply sitting in court and making judgments based only on confessions. For example, in the case of fishing disputes among fishermen using "dragnet boats" in Beitang, the comrades of the trial group went out to sea twice with experienced fishermen during circuit trials to conduct research, and contacted the government's aquatic products department. After two weeks of work, not only were the disputes between these fishermen resolved, but they were also promoted to organize and carry out mutual aid in production.
    At the end of each quarter, we also hold meetings of case parties and mediation committee meetings by district, and regularly visit the parties concerned to check the feedback after the case is handled and listen to the public's opinions on the style of the court cadres. For some cases where the public reflects that the handling is improper and is found to be true after investigation, corrections are made; for cases where there are no errors in handling, but the parties concerned have temporary ideological problems, explanations are given to the parties concerned. Regarding reflections on the style of cadres, if they are true, education or handling is carried out according to the circumstances, and apologies are made to the parties concerned in writing or in person; if it is a misunderstanding by the parties concerned, explanations are also given to them. In this way, our trial work is closely based on the masses and is carried out under the direct supervision of the masses.
    After we implemented the above mass line working methods, the ideological, policy, and professional levels of the cadres were quickly improved. The comrades who newly participated in the trial work initially regarded the trial work as very mysterious and lacked confidence. Now these problems have been gradually resolved. The comrades have a high enthusiasm for work, and everyone has the confidence to do a good job.

    天津市塘沽区人民法院改进工作方法取得良好效果
    天津市塘沽区人民法院通讯组来信：我院经过司法改革运动和学习了第二届全国司法会议决议各项文件以后，采取了群众路线的工作方法共处理了案件八百二十九件，收到良好的效果。
    根据塘沽区的具体情况，我院建立了三个审判组，分担新河郊区、塘沽、大沽北镇三个地区的刑民案件的审判工作，并负责解答群众疑难、进行法纪教育、贯彻审判后的执行等等。审判组建立了巡回审判制度，按日轮流到各处就地解决群众的纠纷。北塘阚玉珍与周恩珍的家庭纠纷，经巡回法庭及时邀请群众代表共同调解，得到圆满解决。事后许多人反映：人民法院真是给人民办事的。
    我们办案时强调深入群众，调查研究，克服了过去单纯坐堂问案，只凭口供判决的旧作风。如北塘使用“张网船”的渔民捕鱼纠纷一案，审判组同志在巡回审判时就找了有经验的渔民两次出海研究，并与政府水产科联系。经过两星期的工作，不但解决了这些渔民之间的纠纷，还推动他们组织起来，进行生产互助。
    在每一季度终，我们还分区召开案件当事人会议和调解委员会议，并定期访问当事人，检查案件处理后的反映，听取群众对法院干部作风的意见。对一些群众反映处理不当而经查属实的案件，即给以纠正；对于处理没有偏差，只是当事人一时思想搞不通的案件，即向当事人解释。对干部作风的反映，如果属实，就分别情况进行教育或处理，并向当事人书面或当面道歉；如属于当事人误会的，也向他解释说明。这样做，就使我们的审判工作紧紧地依靠了群众，并在群众的直接监督下进行。
    我们贯彻了以上的群众路线的工作方法后，干部的思想、政策和业务水平很快提高了。新参加审判工作的同志，当初把审判工作看得很神秘，缺乏信心，现在这些问题都逐步解决了。同志们工作热情很高，大家都有信心把工作做好。
