The Central Ministry of Construction Engineering, the Central Ministry of Transportation, the Central Ministry of Textile Industry, and the Central Ministry of Light Industry, etc., have all made specific arrangements to their subordinate units for carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, and strive to over fulfill the national plan.

Before deploying the work on increasing production and practicing economy, these four departments carefully studied the production and capital construction situations and problems of their respective departments in the first half of the year, and unanimously determined that the campaign to increase production and practice economy must focus on improving business management. The Central Ministry of Construction Engineering decided to focus the campaign on increasing production and practicing economy on improving construction management, instructing its subordinate units to establish and improve the responsibility system to eliminate the chaotic phenomena on construction sites; at the same time, strengthen political work on construction sites, give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of employees, and complete the annual tasks quickly and economically on the premise of ensuring project quality. The Central Ministry of Transportation's instructions on increasing production and practicing economy clearly pointed out: In terms of transportation production, it is necessary to actively improve business management, strengthen the planning of various tasks, strengthen contact with cargo owners, and overcome the disconnection and imbalance in production; strengthen the dispatching of port loading and unloading, improve loading and unloading efficiency, and shorten the non-productive berthing time of ships in ports. The Central Ministry of Textile Industry's policy for increasing production and practicing economy is to implement planned management, strengthen technical measures, carry out labor competitions, promote advanced experience, and maximize the potential of enterprises, in order to comprehensively fulfill and over fulfill the national plan; in terms of strengthening technical management, it is necessary to formulate practical and feasible technical measures plans, and pay special attention to reducing the rate of yarn breakage in spinning and loom downtime in weaving, and improving the quality of finished and semi-finished products. The Central Ministry of Transportation and the Central Ministry of Textile Industry have both determined that in terms of capital construction, it is necessary to strengthen construction management, overcome the phenomenon of no one being responsible, improve quality, and speed up progress. The Central Ministry of Light Industry pointed out in its instructions: Carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy is not only an important guarantee for completing and over fulfilling the annual plan, but also a driving force for improving production and capital construction work. All factories and mines should combine the original central tasks of strengthening planned management and technical management, and gradually improve the level of enterprise management.

These four departments have clearly stipulated specific measures and important precautions in light of the characteristics of their respective departments. The Central Ministry of Construction Engineering's subordinate units did not complete their engineering tasks according to plan in the first half of the year, and there are only two to three months left in the future. Therefore, the ministry instructed engineering bureaus and engineering companies at all levels to quickly conduct extensive publicity and mobilization work to their subordinate construction sites, and conscientiously promote decisive advanced experiences, such as parallel flow operation methods, double-handed mud squeezing methods, level bricklaying methods, and carpenter Xie Wanfu's flow operation method, etc., and do everything possible to speed up the progress of the project and strive to complete the contract tasks under the principle of resolutely ensuring the quality of the project. The Central Ministry of Transportation emphasized that while actively implementing the plan to increase production and practice economy, it is necessary to grasp policies and strengthen political work. In terms of increasing income, it is necessary to prevent the purely financial point of view and the bias of blindly pursuing profits; increasing production and over fulfilling the transportation plan must implement the policy of taking both public and private interests into consideration, pay attention to improving transportation quality, and ensure safety, economy, and rationality; the increase in production plans of affiliated factories must be carried out according to needs, and the manufacture of parts must prevent avoiding difficulties and producing surpluses; vehicle and ship repairs must ensure quality, time, and reduce costs, and should not increase profits too much. The Central Ministry of Textile Industry's specific requirements for its subordinate units are: state-owned cotton textile industry should guarantee the completion of the annual yarn and cloth production plan, make up for the cotton yarn reduced due to changes in variety, and increase the production of cotton yarn by 20,000 pieces and cotton cloth by 730,000 bolts beyond the plan; printing and dyeing, wool spinning, knitting and other industries should increase production as much as possible according to the supply of raw materials and sales needs, and improve varieties and improve quality; the textile machinery manufacturing industry currently has better supply and sales conditions, and should make every effort to give full play to production potential in order to over fulfill the national plan as much as possible; the sack industry should reduce costs, improve quality, improve varieties, and strive to open up sales channels; at the same time, each textile administration bureau is responsible for reporting the specific situation of increasing production and practicing economy to the ministry on time. The Central Ministry of Light Industry decided that the basic task of increasing production and practicing economy in the light industry system at present is mainly to overproduce on the basis of completing this year's production plan, and to ensure improved quality.

In terms of economy, these four departments have determined the direction of economy. The Central Ministry of Construction Engineering decided to save raw materials in construction, reduce waste on construction sites, reduce project costs, and accelerate the turnover of working capital, especially to speed up the disposal of stagnant materials and surplus materials on construction sites; quickly make project final accounts, settle accounts, reduce the amount of working capital; and carry out team rectification, streamline enterprise institutions in a planned, organized, and led manner. The Central Ministry of Transportation pointed out in its instructions: Project items that can be postponed and are optional should be resolutely reduced, and important projects must overcome all difficulties to ensure completion according to plan; at the same time, it is necessary to clean up accumulated materials, and strive to make monthly and quarterly appropriation plans in line with actual conditions, so as to avoid stockpiling cash and blindly purchasing materials, resulting in waste. The Central Ministry of Textile Industry initially decided to postpone and reduce some repair, purchase measures and other undertakings appropriation; requiring all units to save raw materials, fuel, power, tighten enterprise and administrative management expenses, and actively handle stagnant materials. The Central Ministry of Light Industry instructed all its subordinate enterprises and capital construction units to vigorously investigate stagnant materials and invest funds in production and construction. Capital construction units should save materials and labor, and management agencies at all levels should adjust staffing and supplement the production departments that need employees.

    中央建筑工程部、交通部和纺织工业部等
    具体布置增产节约的工作
    中央建筑工程部、中央交通部、中央纺织工业部和中央轻工业部等四个部门为开展增产节约竞赛，争取超额完成国家计划，先后向所属各单位作了具体布置。
    这四个部门在布置增产节约工作之前，都仔细地研究了本部门上半年生产与基本建设的情况和问题，一致确定开展增产节约竞赛必须以改善经营管理为中心。中央建筑工程部决定把增产节约竞赛的重点放在改善施工管理上，指示所属各单位建立和健全责任制，以消灭施工现场的混乱现象；同时加强工地政治工作，充分发挥职工的积极性和创造性，在保证工程质量的前提下，又快又省地完成全年的任务。中央交通部的增产节约指示中明确指出：在运输生产方面，必须积极改善经营管理，加强各项工作的计划性，加强与货主之间的联系，克服生产中的脱节与不均衡的现象；加强港口装卸的调度工作，提高装卸效率，缩短船舶在港非生产停泊时间。中央纺织工业部增产节约的方针是：贯彻计划管理，加强技术措施，开展劳动竞赛，推广先进经验，最大限度地发挥企业潜力，以达到全面地完成和超额完成国家计划；在加强技术管理方面，要制订切实可行的技术措施计划，特别要注意降低细纱断头和织布停台率，提高成品与半成品的质量。中央交通部与中央纺织工业部都确定在基本建设方面要加强施工管理，克服无人负责现象，提高质量，加快进度。中央轻工业部指示中指出：开展增产节约竞赛，不但是完成和超额完成全年计划的重要保证，而且是改善生产与基本建设工作的推动力量。各厂矿应结合原订的加强计划管理与技术管理的中心工作，有步骤地把企业管理水平提高一步。
    这四个部门都针对本部门的工作特点，明确规定了具体措施与重要注意事项。中央建筑工程部所属各单位上半年工程任务没有按计划完成，今后也只有两个月到三个多月的时间，因此该部指示各级工程局和工程公司必须迅速向所属工地进行广泛的宣传动员工作，认真推广有决定性的先进经验，如平行流水作业法，双手挤浆法、水平器砌砖法、木工谢万福流水作业法等，在坚决保证工程质量的原则下，尽一切可能加快工程进度，争取完成承包任务。中央交通部强调在积极执行增产节约计划的同时，必须掌握政策，加强政治工作。在增加收入方面，要防止单纯的财政观点与盲目追逐利润的偏向；增加生产、超额完成运输计划，必须贯彻公私兼顾的政策，注意提高运输质量，保证安全、经济合理；附属工厂的增产计划，必须根据需要进行，配件的制造要防止避难就易和生产过剩的现象；修车修船要保证质量、时间，降低成本，不应过高地增加利润。中央纺织工业部对所属各单位的具体要求是：国营棉纺织业要保证完成全年纱、布生产计划，补足因品种改变而减少的棉纱，并再超计划增产棉纱二万件，棉布七十三万匹；印染、毛纺、针织等业应按原料供应与销售需要情况，尽可能地增加生产，并改进品种、提高质量；纺织机器制造业，目前供应与销售条件都较好，应尽最大努力发挥生产潜力，以求更多地超额完成国家计划；麻袋工业应降低成本，提高质量，改进品种，努力打开销路；同时并责成各纺织管理局按时向部报告增产节约的具体情况。中央轻工业部决定目前轻工业系统增产节约的基本任务，主要是在完成今年生产计划的基础上，超额生产，并保证提高质量。
