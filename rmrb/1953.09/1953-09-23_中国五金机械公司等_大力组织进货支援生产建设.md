To meet the needs of national capital construction and production construction, and to better serve production, China National Hardware and Machinery Company, China National Transportation Electrical Equipment Company, and China National Chemical Raw Materials Company, through reviewing their work in the first half of the year, criticized the shortcomings and errors in their business management. They clarified the position and role of industrial materials in the national planned economic construction, and decided to strengthen procurement and processing orders in the second half of this year in coordination with the industrial sector's production increase and savings campaign, expand sources of goods, closely connect with various construction departments, vigorously promote sales, expand commodity circulation, accelerate capital turnover, and strengthen leadership over the market, so as to give play to the leading role of the state-owned economy.

Most of the basic construction projects across the country are carried out in the third quarter. In order to meet the above requirements, China National Hardware and Machinery Company's procurement plan for the second half of the year has increased by an average of 139.98 percent compared to the first half of the year, of which foreign procurement increased by 167.39 percent, and domestic procurement increased by 116.66 percent. China National Transportation Electrical Equipment Company's procurement plan for the second half of the year increased by 98.02 percent compared to the first half of the year. China National Chemical Raw Materials Company's procurement plan for the second half of the year increased by 73 percent compared to the first half of the year. It was particularly emphasized to pay attention to the procurement of domestic products. On the basis of increased procurement, China National Hardware and Machinery Company's sales target for the second half of the year increased by 43.06 percent compared to the first half of the year; China National Transportation Electrical Equipment Company increased by 71.46 percent; and China National Chemical Raw Materials Company increased by 63 percent.

In order to better complete the arduous new tasks in the second half of the year, China National Hardware and Machinery Company, China National Transportation Electrical Equipment Company, and China National Chemical Raw Materials Company have taken the following measures:

I. Vigorously organize sources of goods: Judging from the business situation in the first half of the year, many regions did not realize that having material strength is the only way to implement the principle of serving production and leading the market, and a general tendency of "only paying attention to completing sales tasks and neglecting organizing sources of goods" was prevalent. This phenomenon began to be reversed at the beginning of the third quarter, and considerable progress has been made in domestic and foreign procurement. The quantity of materials imported from abroad by China National Hardware and Machinery Company in July and August was 89.8 percent of that in the second quarter; the quantity of domestic procurement was 61.45 percent of that in the first half of the year. The quantity of goods procured by China National Transportation Electrical Equipment Company in Shanghai and Tianjin in July and August was 135 percent of the procurement volume in the two places in the second quarter. Ideological importance has been attached to domestic procurement. The processing orders for small hardware and plumbing equipment by China National Hardware and Machinery Company in the third quarter alone, the processing orders for small hardware tools by the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station increased three times compared to the second quarter. The supply of small hardware tools and plumbing equipment in Qingdao in July and August expanded more than doubled compared to the second quarter. The long-term backlog of tools in Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant and Northeast Ten Factories and Thirteen Factories was purchased, and long-term sales contracts were signed to enable them to carry out production in a planned manner. The processing orders for tires by China National Transportation Electrical Equipment Company in the third quarter increased by 134 percent compared to the second quarter. The processing orders for major auto parts increased by 344 percent. China National Chemical Raw Materials Company adopted the principle of guaranteed purchase for products of state-owned factories and mines, actively contacted local leading organs, and actively carried out guaranteed purchase and processing orders for local state-owned and private industrial products. For example, sodium sulfide and sulfide elements, which have large production volumes and are needed by the masses, are promoted by reducing prices and expanding purchases. Phenol and aniline oil, which were previously not produced domestically and completely relied on imports, have been able to meet domestic needs since domestic production began in 1952.

In addition to a large amount of domestic and foreign procurement, a batch of backlog materials from various state-owned enterprises were also purchased. China National Hardware and Machinery Company purchased a batch of scrap aluminum, solving the processing raw materials for aluminum products of China National Department Store Company; and purchased a batch of pig iron from the Southwest; the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station purchased a batch of lead from ethnic minority areas in the Southwest, and appropriately increased the price of lead in the production area. China National Transportation Electrical Equipment Company purchased 129.7 billion yuan worth of backlog materials in Beijing, Qingdao, Guangzhou, and Shenyang alone in the third quarter.

II. Conduct planned supply and pay attention to the balance of production and sales: In order to support production in a planned way and meet the needs of producers and consumers, China National Hardware and Machinery Company also carried out the balance of production and sales of lead wire, wire nails, plumbing equipment parts, small hardware and major tools. In August, Chongqing Hardware and Machinery Company invited responsible cadres from 128 units of national defense military supplies, machinery, chemical industry, geology, railway, transportation, construction, cooperation, schools and other production material departments to visit the inventory of goods, solving part of their needs. At the meeting, the amount of goods requested by various units reached more than 20 billion yuan at a time, further strengthening the purchasing and sales relationship between the relevant units. At the beginning of August, Tianjin Purchasing and Supply Station of China National Transportation Electrical Equipment Company convened a professional meeting under the leadership of the local Finance and Economics Committee and the Commercial Bureau to study the balance of supply of electric motors and transformers, and signed sales contracts with manufacturers. In early September, Beijing Company of China National Transportation Electrical Equipment Company held a planned supply meeting to investigate and study the needs of various construction departments in Beijing for basic construction in order to achieve a balance between production and sales. China National Chemical Raw Materials Company conducted an inspection of the material strength of its directly affiliated companies, carried out exchanges between companies, and signed 328 fourth-quarter contracts and 231 agreements between supply stations and companies. In order to develop the dye sales business in rural areas, it was decided to fully supply department stores and cooperatives with dyes and chemical commodities with greater civilian use, and give a preferential treatment of 2 to 3 percent to achieve universal supply.

III. Appropriately adjust the brand prices of commodities: For a long period of time in the first half of the year, there was a phenomenon of disconnection between brand prices and market prices. The market price of general commodities was lower than the brand price, while the market price of scarce commodities was higher than the brand price, thus prompting speculators to transport them everywhere, causing the phenomenon of commodity detour and backflow. In order to correct the above phenomenon, the prices of major hardware and mechanical commodities were adjusted nationwide in mid-July, and the adjustment range was generally lowered. For example, black iron sheet was reduced by an average of 5 percent; tinplate was reduced by an average of 28.8 percent. Other commodities are being gradually and reasonably adjusted according to the supply situation. A total of seven types of transportation electrical equipment were lowered, the largest decrease being for tires, which was lowered by 32.11 percent; the smallest decrease was for loudspeakers, which was lowered by 2.63 percent. China National Chemical Raw Materials Company adjusted unreasonable prices in the second and third quarters of this year according to domestic and international market conditions. Judging from the market situation after the adjustment, the material using units generally responded well, and most of the equipment was purchased from state-owned trading departments, which can not only reduce the difficulty for users to run to the market for procurement, but also reduce the cost of industrial production, which will play a certain role in supporting industrial production, handicraft production and supplying market needs.

    中国五金机械公司等
    大力组织进货支援生产建设
    为适应国家基本建设和生产建设的需要，更好地为生产服务，中国五金机械公司、中国交通电工器材公司和中国化工原料公司通过检查上半年工作，批判了经营管理上的缺点和错误，明确了工业器材在国家有计划的经济建设中的地位和作用，决定今年下半年配合工业部门的增产节约竞赛，加强收购和加工订货，扩大货源；密切与各建设部门的联系，大力推销，扩大商品流通，加速资金周转，加强对市场的领导，以发挥国营经济的领导作用。
    各地基本建设工程大部分在第三季度进行。为了满足上述要求，中国五金机械公司下半年进货计划比上半年平均增加百分之一百三十九点九八，其中国外进货增加百分之一百六十七点三九；国内进货增加百分之一百十六点六六；中国交通电工器材公司下半年进货计划比上半年增加百分之九十八点零二；中国化工原料公司下半年收购计划比上半年增加百分之七十三；并特别强调注意国内产品的收购。在进货增加的基础上，中国五金机械公司下半年销售任务比上半年增加百分之四十三点零六；中国交通电工器材公司增加百分之七十一点四六；中国化工原料公司增加百分之六十三。
    为了更好地完成下半年艰巨的新任务，中国五金机械公司、中国交通电工器材公司、中国化工原料公司采取了下列措施：
    一、大力组织货源：从上半年经营情况来看，很多地区没有认识到有了物资力量才能贯彻为生产服务、领导市场的道理，普遍产生“只重视完成销售任务而忽视组织货源”的偏向。第三季度初开始扭转了这一现象，国内、外的进货都有相当进展。中国五金机械公司七、八月份自国外进口的物资数量为第二季度的百分之八十九点八；国内进货数量为上半年的百分之六十一点四五。中国交通电工器材公司七、八月份在上海、天津两地进货数量，为第二季度两地进货量的百分之一百三十五。对国内进货已从思想上重视起来。中国五金机械公司今年第三季度对小五金水暖器材的加工，仅上海采购供应站对小五金工具的加工订货量，就比第二季度增加了三倍。青岛七、八月份小五金工具和水暖器材供应量比第二季度扩大一倍以上。对上海钢铁厂及东北十厂、十三厂长期积压的工具进行了收购，并订立长期的包销合同，使其有计划地进行生产。中国交通电工器材公司第三季度轮胎的加工订货比第二季度增加百分之一百三十四。主要汽车零件的加工订货增加百分之三百四十四。中国化工原料公司对国营厂矿产品，采取包购原则，主动和地方领导机关联系，积极进行对地方国营与私营工业产品的包购与加工订货。如硫化碱、硫化元等生产量较大，又为广大群众所需，采取降价推销并扩大收购的办法，石炭酸、安尼林油等过去国内均无生产，完全依赖进口。自一九五二年国内开始生产后，目前已能满足国内需要。
    除了大量地组织国内、外进货外，还收购了一批各国营企业的积压物资。中国五金机械公司收购了一批废铝，解决了中国百货公司铝制品的加工原料；又向西南收购了一批生铁；上海采购供应站向西南少数民族地区收购了一批青铅，并在产区适当地提高了青铅的价格。中国交通电工器材公司第三季度仅在北京、青岛、广州、沈阳四地，即收购价值一千二百九十七亿元的积压物资。
    二、进行有计划的供应，注意产销平衡：为了有计划地扶持生产，满足生产者和消费者的需要，中国五金机械公司又作了铅丝、洋钉、水暖器材零件、小五金及主要工具的产销平衡工作。重庆市五金机械公司在八月份邀请国防军需、机械、化工、地质、铁路、交通、建筑、合作、学校等生产用料部门一百二十八个单位的负责干部参观库存商品，解决了他们的部分需要。各单位在会议上提出要货者一次即达二百余亿元，进一步密切了各有关单位的购销关系。中国交通电工器材公司天津市采购供应站八月初在当地财政经济委员会、商业局的领导下召开了专业会议，研究平衡电动机、变压器的供应，并与厂商订立包销合同。九月初，中国交通电工器材公司北京市公司召开计划供应会议，调查研究满足北京市各建筑部门基本建设的需要，以达到产销平衡。中国化工原料公司对各直属公司物资力量进行了检查，在公司之间进行了交流，供应站与公司之间签订了第四季度合同三百二十八份，协议二百三十一份。为了开展染料下乡业务，决定充分供应百货公司和合作社染料及民用性较大的化工类商品，并给予百分之二至三的优待，以做到普遍供应。
    三、适当地调整商品的牌价：在上半年较长的时期内，市场存在着牌市价脱节的现象，一般的商品是市价低于牌价；而市场上的奇缺商品则市价高于牌价，因而促使投机商人到处贩运，造成商品迂回倒流的现象。为了纠正上述现象，全国在七月中旬调整了五金机械主要商品的价格，其调整幅度一般都是调低。如黑铁皮平均调低百分之五；马口铁平均调低百分之二十八点八。其他商品正根据供应情况逐步合理调整。交通电工器材共调低了七种，调低幅度最大的是轮胎，计调低了百分之三十二点一一；调低幅度最小的是扬声器，计调低百分之二点六三。中国化工原料公司在今年二、三季度内，根据国内国际市场情况，将不合理的价格进行调整。根据调整后的市场情况来看，用料单位一般反映良好，大部分器材都向国营贸易部门采购，这样不仅可以减少用户奔跑市场采购上的困难，还可减低工业生产的成本，这对于扶持工业生产、手工业生产及供应市场需要将起到一定的作用。
