    Farmers in Various Parts of East China Launch Autumn Cultivation
    Local Leading Organs Provide Timely Supply of Wheat Seeds and Technical Guidance
    With the comprehensive unfolding of the autumn harvest, autumn cultivation has begun in various parts of East China in preparation for autumn sowing. In the Linyi, Tai'an, Heze, and Qiangteng County areas of Shandong Province, more than 60% of the sorghum and millet stubble fields had been plowed by early September, with some even achieving plowing while harvesting. In Anhui Province, the Li Yansong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Longquan Township, Huanglong District, Huaining County, was harvesting rice while plowing paddy fields. In the Yunhe District of Pi County, Jiangsu Province, sorghum stubble fields have generally been plowed once, with better mutual aid groups having plowed twice.

    All localities have attached great importance to preparations for autumn sowing. In addition to issuing instructions on autumn agricultural production, Party and government leading organs in various localities have provided farmers with significant assistance in terms of materials and technology. Zhejiang, Fujian, and southern Jiangsu generally had good wheat harvests this year, so there are generally no problems with wheat seeds. Areas north of the Yangtze River that lack seeds due to wheat disasters this spring are also making adjustments locally. All localities have also made great efforts to supply autumn sowing fertilizers and farm tools. According to incomplete statistics from cooperatives in Dezhou and Laiyang areas of Shandong Province, approximately 100 million jin of cotton cake, sesame cake, and bean cake have been processed using local raw materials for supply to farmers. Laiyang and Linyi areas have processed and manufactured more than 400,000 various small farm tools. The Changwei and Qiangteng County areas have prepared more than 3,800 new-style walking plows and more than 3,000 waterwheels. Some areas of Zhejiang and Anhui provinces have also organized iron, wood, and bamboo handicraftsmen to rush-manufacture various necessary small farm tools for farmers. In addition to planning the supply of commercial fertilizers, localities are vigorously mobilizing the masses to increase the accumulation of natural fertilizers in order to meet the current needs of farmers for increased production and to increase farmers' net income.

    This year's technical guidance work for autumn sowing has been strengthened compared to previous years and is very timely. In late August, the East China Agricultural, Forestry, and Water Conservancy Bureau convened a wheat production technology symposium with representatives from Shandong, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai, and relevant scientific research institutions, focusing on the technical measures for increasing wheat production in different regions, while emphasizing consideration of the geographical nature of agricultural production. The meeting also put forward opinions on future agricultural science and technology work. In addition to holding a meeting of technical guidance stations and state-owned farms in early August, focusing on technical guidance issues, the Shandong Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry recently dispatched more than 50 technical cadres to Guangrao, Wendeng, Heze, and other five counties to guide autumn sowing work. Wendeng, Tai'an, and Changwei areas, as well as the Qiangteng County area, have all held technical meetings or wheat production increase symposiums. After discussions with experienced farmers, the Changwei area has initially identified the key to increasing production in different natural conditions such as alkaline land and low-lying land. Laiyang and Jiaozhou areas have also mobilized the masses to conduct wheat germination experiments. The CCP Dafeng County Committee of Jiangsu Province invited old farmers to hold a symposium, focusing on the technical issues of autumn cultivation and autumn sowing. The Zhejiang Provincial People's Government also pointed out in its instructions on autumn harvesting and autumn sowing work that in order to increase the yield per unit area of various crops, in addition to timely sowing, attention should be paid to steadily improving agricultural technology work in autumn sowing according to different conditions and habits.

    华东各地农民展开秋耕工作
    各地领导机关适时供应种麦物资和进行技术指导
    华东各地随着秋收工作的全面展开，已开始秋耕，准备秋种。山东省临沂、泰安、菏泽、前滕县等专区的高粱和谷子茬地在九月初已耕了百分之六十以上，有的并做到边收边耕。安徽省怀宁县黄龙区龙泉乡李焰松农业生产合作社一面割稻一面耕板田。江苏省邳县运河区的高粱茬地，一般都耕了一遍，较好的互助组已耕了两遍。
    各地对秋种的准备工作都很重视。各地党、政领导机关除分别发布有关秋季农业生产工作的指示外，并在物质上、技术上给农民以很大的帮助。浙江、福建及苏南地区，今年麦子普遍丰收，麦种一般不成问题。长江以北今春因小麦受灾而缺种的地区，也正在当地进行调剂。各地对秋种肥料及农具的供应也尽了很大的努力，据山东省德州、莱阳等专区合作社的不完全统计，利用当地原料加工了棉饼、麻饼、豆饼约一亿斤，准备供应农民使用。莱阳、临沂两专区加工制造了各种小农具四十多万件。昌潍、前滕县两专区准备了新式步犁三千八百余部，水车三千余架。浙江、安徽两省部分地区并组织铁、木、竹手工业者，为农民突击制造各种必需的小农具。各地除了筹划商品肥料的供应外，为适应当前农民增产的需要，增加农民的纯收入，并大力动员群众增积自然肥料。
    今年秋种的技术指导工作较往年加强，并且很适时。八月下旬，华东农林水利局就召开了有山东、安徽、江苏、浙江、上海等省、市及有关的科学研究机关代表参加的小麦生产技术座谈会，着重研究了不同地区小麦增产的技术措施，同时强调照顾农业生产的地域性。会议并对今后农业科学技术工作提出了意见。山东省农林厅除在八月上旬召开技术指导站及国营农场会议，着重研究了技术指导问题外，最近又派出技术干部五十余人，分赴广饶、文登、菏泽等五个县，指导秋种工作。文登、泰安、昌潍等专区和前滕县专区都召开过技术会议或小麦增产座谈会。昌潍专区经过有经验的农民座谈后，初步找出了碱地、洼地等不同自然条件的增产关键。莱阳、胶州两专区并发动群众进行小麦发芽试验。中共江苏省大丰县委会邀请老农举行座谈会，着重研究秋耕秋种的技术问题。浙江省人民政府在关于秋收秋种工作的指示中也指出为了提高各种作物的单位面积产量，除及时播种外，在秋种中应根据不同条件和习惯，重视稳步地改进农业技术工作。
