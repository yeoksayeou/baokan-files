    North China Region Largely Issues Agricultural Loans According to Farmers' Needs
   [Our Newspaper News] The North China region is largely issuing agricultural loans according to the actual needs of farmers. The North China region plans to issue agricultural loans worth more than 1.3 trillion yuan this year. In the first half of the year, in coordination with spring plowing and sowing, summer topdressing, pest control, and seedling protection, 816.7 billion yuan has been issued in a timely manner. According to incomplete statistics, the issued loans have helped farmers repair and newly open more than 2,500 canals, dig more than 12,800 wells, repair 2,300 wells, drill more than 20,000 wells, and purchase more than 46,000 waterwheels. Shanxi Province alone used loans to expand paddy fields by more than 80,000 mu, purchased more than 21,000 pieces of agricultural equipment, 162.35 million catties of fertilizer, more than 10.26 million catties of seeds, more than 1.45 million catties of feed, 19,528 draft animals, 974 breeding animals, and 498 female animals. The issuance of agricultural loans has helped farmers solve many practical difficulties in production and life, and has been welcomed by the broad masses of farmers.
    In the first half of the year, some areas also experienced some shortcomings and errors in the work of issuing agricultural loans. First, in terms of loan recipients, some areas overemphasized taking care of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, and neglected assistance to poor farmers among individual farmers. For example, the sixth district of Linfen County, Shanxi Province, distributed all loans to four cooperatives and thirty-five mutual aid teams. Some cooperatives received loans equal to their total output value, which affected their own business due to excessive debt. Second, there was an excessive emphasis on dedicated funds for specific purposes, and the proportion of equipment loans was too large. For example, Suiyuan Province originally planned to lend farmers more than 4,400 waterwheels, but farmers actually only needed more than 2,000, and the remaining 2,000 waterwheels were stockpiled, while the loans for draft animals, seeds, and fertilizers that farmers urgently needed were squeezed out. Third, some areas distributed loans evenly, so that the loans could not play their due role. For example, in Linhe County, Suiyuan Province, the average loan for each cart was 500,000 yuan, so farmers could not buy good carts. In addition, complicated loan procedures also affected the progress of the issuance work. For example, in Xuanhua City, Hebei Province, some areas in Yuci Prefecture, Shanxi Province, and Fengtai District, Beijing, farmers had to go through eight procedures to receive a loan: obtaining an application form, finding a production committee member for approval, a financial team introduction, sending the application form to the bank, the bank sending cadres to the village for investigation, filling out a receipt, and withdrawing money. The emergence of these shortcomings and errors is mainly because the spirit of the policy that the issuance of agricultural loans is to truly help farmers overcome difficulties and develop production was not deeply understood in various places, and the actual needs of farmers were not understood in a deep and concrete way.
    Since late March, all parts of the North China region have studied the three documents of the CPC Central Committee's instructions to the Party committees at all levels on spring plowing production, earnestly inspected the work of issuing agricultural loans, and began to correct past shortcomings. Various regions have adjusted the proportion of equipment loans, and paid attention to correcting the tendencies of overemphasizing loans to organized farmers while neglecting poor farmers among individual farmers. For example, Shanxi Province reduced equipment loans by 31 percent and increased revolving loans by 6 percent. In April, Ding County Prefecture, Hebei Province, increased loans for draft animals, fertilizers, and waterwheel repairs, expanding revolving loans by 37.5 percent, and changed loans for fertilizers, carts, etc., to the issuance of currency. The fertilizer loans issued by Li County before sowing were not issued to individual farmers, and individual farmers received 54 percent of the 900 million yuan of fertilizer loans issued after sowing. This timely and effectively helped poor farmers overcome practical difficulties and played a positive role in supporting production. However, some areas have also produced thoughts such as "the masses can do anything with loans" and "organized farmers don't need loans this year," which are also wrong. In order to give full play to the due role of agricultural loans, all regions should organize relevant cadres to earnestly study the "Instructions of the State Council of the Central People's Government on Issuing Agricultural Loans," and conduct inspections in light of actual work, accept lessons, draw experience, and formulate improvement methods, and earnestly implement policies in the agricultural loan work in the second half of the year to more effectively help farmers overcome difficulties and develop production.

### 华北大部地区按照农民需要发放农业贷款

    华北大部地区按照农民需要发放农业贷款
   【本报讯】华北大部地区按照农民的实际需要，发放农业贷款。华北区今年计划发放农业贷款一万三千余亿元。上半年，配合春耕播种、夏季追肥、除虫、保苗等工作，已及时发放了八千一百六十七亿元。据不完全的统计，发放的贷款，已帮助农民修整和新开渠道二千五百多条，打井一万二千八百多眼，修井二千三百多眼，锥井二万多眼，购买水车四万六千多辆。仅山西省就利用贷款扩大了水田八万余亩，购买了农具二万一千余件、肥料一亿六千二百三十五万斤、种籽一千零二十六万余斤、饲料一百四十五万余斤、耕畜一万九千五百二十八头、种畜九百七十四头和母畜四百九十八头。农业贷款的发放，帮助农民解决了许多生产、生活中的实际困难，受到了广大农民群众的欢迎。
    部分地区上半年在发放农业贷款工作中，也曾经发生了一些缺点和错误。首先，在贷款对象上，有些地区过分强调照顾农业生产合作社和互助组，忽视了对个体农民中贫困农民的扶助。如山西省临汾县六区就将全部贷款分配给四个合作社和三十五个互助组。有的合作社贷到的款数和生产总值相等，因负债过重，影响了本身的业务。其次，过分强调专款专用，设备性贷款比重过大。例如绥远省原计划贷给农民水车四千四百余辆，实际上农民只需要二千余辆，其余的二千多辆水车就积压了下来，而农民迫切需要的耕畜、种籽、肥料贷款反被挤掉。再次，某些地区平均分配贷款，使贷款不能发挥应有的作用。例如绥远省临河县对每辆大车的贷款平均发给五十万元，农民因而买不到好车。此外，贷款手续过繁，也影响发放工作的进行。如河北省宣化市、山西省榆次专区部分地区和北京市丰台区，农民领一次贷款，要经过领申请书、找生产委员批准、金融小组介绍、到银行送申请书、银行派干部到村调查、填写借据、取款等八道手续。这些缺点和错误的产生，主要是由于各地对发放农业贷款是为了真正帮助农民克服困难、发展生产的政策精神领会不深，又没有深入具体地了解农民的实际需要。
    三月下旬以来，华北区各地都对中共中央关于春耕生产给各级党委的指示等三个文件，进行了学习，切实检查了发放农业贷款工作，开始着手纠正过去的缺点。各地对设备性贷款的比例作了调整，并注意纠正过分强调贷款给组织起来的农民而忽视个体农民中的贫困农民等偏向。如山西省将设备性贷款降低了百分之三十一，周转性贷款增加了百分之六。河北省定县专区在四月份即增加了耕畜、肥料、修理水车等项贷款，扩大了百分之三十七点五的周转性贷款，并将肥料、大车等项贷款改为发放货币。蠡县在播种前发的肥料贷款没有发给个体农民，播种后发的九亿元肥料贷款，个体农民贷到了百分之五十四。这就及时有效地帮助贫苦农民克服了实际困难、发挥了扶助生产的积极作用。但是，某些地区又产生了“群众贷款作什么也行”、“组织起来的，今年用不着贷款”等思想，这也是错误的。为了使农业贷款充分发挥应有的作用，各地应组织有关干部认真学习“中央人民政府政务院关于发放农业贷款的指示”，并结合实际工作进行检查，接受教训，吸取经验，订出改进办法，在下半年的农业贷款工作中切实贯彻政策，更有效地帮助农民克服困难、发展生产。
