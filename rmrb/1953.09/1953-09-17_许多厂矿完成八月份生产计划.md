    Many factories and mines in Northeast China, North China, East China, and other regions have completed or overfulfilled their national production plans for August.

    Many factories and mines affiliated with the state-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company have completed and overfulfilled their national production plans for August. Among them, the steelmaking plant overfulfilled by 1.6 percent; the medium-sized rolling mill overfulfilled by 7.1 percent; the small rolling mill overfulfilled by 18.8 percent; the thin plate plant overfulfilled by 8.7 percent; the sintering ore of the ore dressing plant overfulfilled by 11.1 percent; and the primary rolling mill also reversed the situation of failing to complete its tasks in June and July, overfulfilling by 0.2 percent. In addition, iron smelting, coking, steel rope, and other plants also completed their August production plans. In August, the factories and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel Company conscientiously implemented the work plans and further strengthened the maintenance of mechanical equipment. Some factories and mines also vigorously promoted various advanced experiences. At the same time, all factories and mines also deeply mobilized the masses of workers and launched labor competitions to welcome the National Day. In the labor competition, the workers of the steelmaking plant, by continuing to implement the work plan and strengthening the protection of the furnace body, not only extended the service life of the furnace body and shortened the cold repair time, but also greatly shortened the steelmaking time. In August, the average steelmaking time of each open-hearth furnace was thirteen minutes shorter than in July.
    Forty-two state-owned and local state-owned factories in Dalian and Lushun completed or overfulfilled their national plans for August. The state-owned factories that completed the plan included sixteen units such as Dalian Steel Plant, Dalian Chemical Plant, and the Seventh Cement Plant. The number of state-owned factories that completed the plan increased by 22.77 percent compared to July. The completion of plans by local state-owned factories has also improved, with six more factories completing plans than last month. The overall situation in the city has improved compared to the past few months, not only completing the output and quality plans and reducing accidents, but also improving enterprise management compared to the past. For example, after strengthening its planning management, Dalian Steel Plant overfulfilled the national plan in August. The total value of goods exceeded the plan by 20.27 percent, and the total value of production exceeded the plan by 10.5 percent. The work of rectifying labor discipline in various factories has also effectively guaranteed the completion of the national plan. The machinery workshop of Dalian Crane Factory completed the national plan by 32 percent in excess due to the increase in worker attendance.
    Thirty-two state-owned and local state-owned factories in Harbin have overfulfilled their national production plans for August. These factories include China's current large-scale machine tool manufacturing plants, battery factories, forest railway locomotive and vehicle manufacturing plants, flax textile mills, and movie projector manufacturing plants. Since July, all factories have strengthened planning management, technical management, and labor discipline education, and have made significant progress in completing plans in a balanced manner and exceeding economic quotas compared to the past. For example, after conscientiously implementing the work plan, the state-owned Machine Tool Plant No. 10's actual total production value in August exceeded the plan by 4.8 percent, and the equilibrium rate of production reached 94.5 percent. The third workshop of the factory, which did a better job in planning management, comprehensively overfulfilled the plan for all thirteen products in August.
    Forty-six state-owned and local state-owned factories in Tianjin completed or overfulfilled their national production plans for August. Among them are the large-scale state-owned Tianjin cotton textile factories, printing and dyeing factories, and the power plants affiliated to the Tianjin Electric Power Bureau. Many factories achieved a comprehensive and balanced completion of the national plan in August. The production equilibrium rate of Tianjin Bicycle Factory has reached 91 percent. All indicators of the power plants affiliated to the Tianjin Electric Power Bureau were overfulfilled in August. The product quality of various factories has improved significantly in August. The North China Textile Administration did not complete the planned rate of first-class cotton cloth in the first half of the year, but completed 100.26 percent in August. The quality of six major products such as steel ingots produced by Tianjin Steel Plant reached the prescribed standards. In July, only about 50 percent of the various products of Tianjin Paper Mill were qualified, but in August, more than 90 percent were qualified.
    Production in state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines in Taiyuan has been rising month by month, and fifteen major factories and mines overfulfilled their national production plans in August. Among them are Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory, Shanxi Machine Factory, Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, Taiyuan Transportation Factory, Dongshan Coal Mine, and Taiyuan Cement Factory. Of the eight major products of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, five products overfulfilled the plan, and high-grade special steel created the highest monthly production record since the opening of the furnace. In general, production in various factories and mines is on the rise. Shanxi Machine Factory not only overfulfilled the August plan, but also made up for the shortfall in July. Production at Xishan Coal Mine has also been increasing month by month. The workers of various factories and mines in Taiyuan produced more and better products in August, meeting the needs of national economic construction and people's lives. For example, small steel products of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant exceeded by 18.5 percent, cement of Taiyuan Cement Plant exceeded by 6.29 percent, and Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory and Shanxi Machine Factory overfulfilled the manufacturing plan for various types of drilling rigs, all of which promptly met the urgent requirements of various basic construction units.
    State-owned and joint state-private machinery and electrical appliance manufacturing factories in East China successfully completed the national production plan for August. The total value of production for the entire month completed 113.4 percent of the plan. The total value of goods completed 103.6 percent of the plan. Fifteen of the twenty-one factories comprehensively completed the plan. Fifty-three major products were completed or overfulfilled. The August plan for these factories was higher than any previous month, more than double that of the same period last year. Many factories also completed important new products and delivery tasks that had to be completed ahead of schedule. Shanghai Boiler Factory completed the first boiler in the country that produces 18 tons of steam per hour, and a 20-ton bridge-type crane. Shanghai Huatong Switch Factory successfully trial-produced two different 10,000-volt voltage frequency oil circuit breakers according to Soviet standards. Shanghai Wire Factory also rushed to produce a large number of copper wires and cables for the Anshan No. 7 blast furnace and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Broadcasting Station construction projects, which will be completed this year.
    Twenty major state-owned, local state-owned, and joint state-private factories in Nanjing overfulfilled the national production plan in August, and the quality of the products reached the national standards. These factories include Nanjing Machine Tool Factory, Electrical Porcelain Factory, Bulb Factory, Film Machinery Factory, and Yongli Chemical Company Nanjing Factory, which are larger in scale in Nanjing City.
    Twenty-four major factories and mines in Chongqing overfulfilled or completed the August production plan for major products. Seven factories in the heavy industry system, such as Steel Plant 101 and Steel Plant 102, completed and overfulfilled the plan. Among them, rail products exceeded by 33.92 percent, fully meeting the needs of the construction of new lines in major railways across the country. The quality of products from major factories and mines also improved significantly in August. The qualified rate of rolled steel products at Plant 102 reached 96 percent, the highest record since this year. The quality of yarn in various textile factories has also greatly improved, and the yarn of two factories has risen to first class. The production equilibrium rate of major factories and mines has also moved forward. The equilibrium rate of various products at Plant 101 increased by 0.1 to 6.59 percent compared to July.
