    Xinhua News Agency Report: In the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, the People's Great Polder, opened on the north bank of the Yangtze River in Shishou County, Hubei Province, to resettle migrants from the flood diversion area, has, after a year of hard work by reclamation area migrants, transformed wasteland into a vast expanse of fertile fields crisscrossed by paths, with many new villages appearing within the polder. This year, the People's Great Polder's autumn harvest averaged over 80%: rice yields generally reached 400-500 catties per mu, with many high-yield households achieving 700-800 catties per mu. Soybean, sesame, and other miscellaneous grain harvests exceeded 90%. Although cotton suffered some disasters, it generally still yielded 100-200 catties of seed cotton per mu, with good yields reaching 300-400 catties. Coupled with the further expansion of cultivated land area, this year's autumn crops in the People's Great Polder are estimated to have increased by more than double compared to last year.
    Over the past year, the People's Government has actively supported the people in the reclamation area in building new homes and developing production. When the people from the flood diversion area moved into the People's Great Polder, were allotted land, and began reclaiming wasteland for production, the People's Government actively sought ways to supply farmers with means of production and tools. Simultaneously, it transferred fifteen tractors from state-owned farms throughout Hubei Province to help farmers within the area reclaim some of the hard soil with many reed and weed roots. Last winter, the People's Government allocated over 1.1 billion yuan in various relief funds and "work-for-relief" funds, along with over 3 million catties of rice, to the farmers in the People's Great Polder, mobilizing them to construct nearly 300 large drainage ditches and many waterlogged embankments to drain waterlogged areas. These projects freed half of the cultivated land in the People's Great Polder from waterlogging. This spring, the People's Government further issued nearly 700 million yuan in agricultural loans, helping migrants in the reclamation area overcome difficulties such as the lack of draft animals, farm tools, fertilizer, and seeds, enabling farmers within the polder to timely complete spring plowing and planting.

    荆江分洪工程中开辟的人民大垸
    今年的秋收平均在八成以上
    据新华社讯：荆江分洪工程中，为安置分洪区移民，在长江北岸湖北省石首县境内开辟的人民大垸，经过垦殖区移民一年来努力建设，荒洲已变成一望无际阡陌相连的良田绿野，垸内已出现了许多新型的村庄。今年人民大垸的秋收平均在八成以上：稻谷产量一般每亩可收四五百斤，每亩产稻七八百斤的丰产户也很多。黄豆、芝麻等杂粮收成在九成以上。棉花虽然遭受了一些灾害，一般每亩仍能收一二百斤籽棉，好的达三四百斤。加之耕地面积进一步的扩大，今年人民大垸的秋庄稼约比去年增产一倍以上。
    一年来，人民政府积极扶助垦殖区人民新建家园发展生产。当分洪区人民迁入人民大垸，分得土地着手开荒播种生产时，人民政府积极设法供应农民生产资料和生产工具，同时，又从湖北省各地国营农场调拨了十五部拖拉机，帮助境内农民开垦部分土硬根多的芦草荒草土地。去年冬天，人民政府又给人民大垸农民拨出各种救济款和“以工代赈”款十一亿多万元，米三百多万斤，动员垸内农民修筑了近三百条大排水沟和许多排除渍水的渍水堤。这些工程使人民大垸有一半耕地免除了渍水。今年春季，人民政府又贷发了近七亿元的农业贷款，为垦殖区移民克服了缺乏耕牛、农具、肥料、种籽等困难，使垸内农民及时做好春耕播种。
