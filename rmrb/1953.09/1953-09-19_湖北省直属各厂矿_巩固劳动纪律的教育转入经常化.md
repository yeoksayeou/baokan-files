　　Factories and Mines Directly Under the Jurisdiction of Hubei Province:
　　Education on Consolidating Labor Discipline Turns to Regularization
　　Hubei Provincial Farm Implement Manufacturing Plant, Wuhan and Suihua Match Factories, Dada Tobacco Factory, Xinhua Glass Factory, Xinhua Pharmaceutical Factory, Yingcheng Gypsum Mine, Provincial Ship Repair Yard, Provincial Paper Mill, and others, starting from June, successively conducted a concentrated education on abiding by labor discipline for the masses of workers. This work has now been turned into a regular practice.
　　At the beginning, each factory and mine first mobilized cadres and Party and League members to conduct education, overcoming the cadres' thinking of "fearing to manage workers," so that cadres and Party and League members clearly understood the important significance of consolidating labor discipline, and explained the guidelines and policies. Then, deep mobilization was carried out among the workers, policies were explained, criticism and self-criticism were carried out, and education was conducted. Some factories and mines, such as Dada Tobacco Factory and Yingcheng Gypsum Mine, also selected advanced workers who consistently observed labor discipline during the consolidation of labor discipline, publicized their exemplary deeds and advanced ideas, established good role models among the masses, and greatly educated the workers. After the workers were mobilized, some workers had impatient emotions, but the leadership always implemented the policy of adhering to education, patiently persuaded and educated them, overcame the excessive emotions of some workers, and enabled the work to be carried out steadily and smoothly. Finally, each factory and mine put forward improvement methods, established necessary systems, and gradually made the work of consolidating labor discipline regular.
　　After consolidating labor discipline, the ideological awareness of the workers has generally improved, and the phenomenon of lax labor discipline has gradually been overcome. Shen Yuzhen, a young female worker in the third workshop of Wuhan Match Factory, said: "I now understand that socialist society must be created by our own active labor, and I must work hard in production." The phenomena of being late, leaving early, and absenteeism have been basically eliminated in various factories and mines, and the absenteeism rate has been greatly reduced. For example, in Yingcheng Gypsum Mine, the absenteeism rate in the past in each workshop was above 15%, and even reached 20.3% in the third workshop; after consolidating labor discipline, the absenteeism rate in August dropped to 10%. The absenteeism rate of the Provincial Ship Repair Yard also dropped from the original 16.7% to 5%.
　　After consolidating labor discipline, there has also been great improvement in production in various factories and mines. For example, the cold work riveting department of the Provincial Ship Repair Yard launched a competition in conjunction with consolidating labor discipline, and worker Chen Shoucai created a new record of riveting 1,400 rivets a day. The average daily output of the stem section of the first workshop of Wuhan Match Factory increased from 60 trays to 85 trays, and reached 116 trays at the highest; waste was reduced by 60%. After the consolidation of labor discipline in various factories and mines, rework and defective work have been greatly reduced.
　　Some factories and mines took the initiative to improve the labor conditions of the factories and mines and improve the welfare of the workers during the consolidation of labor discipline, which further educated the workers and improved their awareness. For example, the Provincial Farm Implement Manufacturing Plant rebuilt the cafeteria, increased ventilation equipment, and reduced the temperature of the workshop. The leaders of Yingcheng Gypsum Mine actively tried to install a ventilator in the mine, so that the problem of gun smoke and ventilation, which had not been solved for a long time, was solved. In the past, there were not enough mine lamps, which affected work, but the Provincial Department of Industry has allocated more than 140 lamps, which will be solved soon. Worker Zhang Huogou said: "The leaders care about us so much, we must wholeheartedly do a good job in production."
　　After full discussion by the masses, most factories and mines have also formulated attendance systems, reward systems, etc., so that the work of consolidating labor discipline has become regular and institutionalized. For example, in Suihua Match Factory, there are very few people who are absent from work without reason, and they are not late for meetings. The workers obey the organization's arrangements, and the phenomenon of non-standard matchbox packaging has also been overcome. After the Provincial Farm Implement Manufacturing Plant formulated various systems, the小组 also formulated covenants and has generally inspected them once.
　　The factories and mines directly under the jurisdiction of the province are now carrying out the work of evaluating labor models, and some are combining this with the establishment of various responsibility systems, preparing to further strengthen the work of planned management on the basis of consolidating labor discipline.

    湖北省直属各厂矿
    巩固劳动纪律的教育转入经常化
    湖北省直属农具制造厂、武汉、燧华两火柴厂、大达烟厂、新华玻璃厂、新华化学制药厂、应城石膏矿、省修船厂、省造纸厂等，从六月开始，先后集中地向职工群众进行了一次遵守劳动纪律的教育。现在这一工作已转入经常化。
    各厂矿在开始时都首先发动干部和党员、团员进行了教育，克服干部“怕管工人”的思想，使干部及党员、团员明确认识巩固劳动纪律的重要意义，并交代方针政策。然后在工人中深入动员，交代政策，开展批评与自我批评，进行教育。有的厂矿，如大达烟厂和应城石膏矿，在巩固劳动纪律中，还评选了一贯遵守劳动纪律的先进工人，宣传他们的模范事迹和先进思想，在群众中树立了良好的榜样，大大地教育了职工群众。工人发动起来以后，部分工人曾有急躁情绪，但领导上始终贯彻了坚持教育的方针，耐心说服教育，克服了部分工人的过火情绪，使工作得以稳步顺利地开展。最后，各厂矿都提出了改进办法，建立必要的制度，逐渐把巩固劳动纪律的工作经常化。
    经过巩固劳动纪律，职工思想觉悟普遍提高，劳动纪律松弛的现象逐渐克服。武汉火柴厂三车间青年女工沈玉珍说：“我现在明白了，社会主义社会要靠我们自己积极劳动去创造，我一定要好好生产。”各厂矿迟到早退和旷工的现象基本消灭，缺勤率大大减少。如应城石膏矿，过去各车间缺勤率都在百分之十五以上，三车间甚至达到百分之二十点三；经过巩固劳动纪律，八月份缺勤率降到百分之十。省修船厂的缺勤率也由原来的百分之十六点七降低到百分之五。
    经过巩固劳动纪律，各厂矿在生产上也有很大改进。如省修船厂冷作铆钉部门结合巩固劳动纪律开展竞赛，工人陈守才创造了一天铆钉一千四百个的新纪录。武汉火柴厂一车间梗片部每天平均产量由六十盘提高到八十五盘，最高时达到了一百一十六盘；浪费减少了百分之六十。各厂矿巩固劳动纪律后，返工废活都大大减少。
    有的厂矿在巩固劳动纪律中主动改进厂矿的劳动条件，改善职工的福利，这也更进一步教育了工人群众，提高了他们的觉悟。如省农具制造厂改建了食堂，增加通风设备，减低了车间的温度。应城石膏矿领导方面积极设法把抽风机安下矿井，使长久没有解决的炮烟和通风问题得到了解决。过去矿灯不够，影响工作，现已由省工业厅拨去一百四十几盏，很快就可解决。工人张火苟说：“领导上这样关心我们，我们要一心一意地搞好生产。”
    大部厂矿经过群众充分讨论，还订立了考勤制度奖励制度等，使巩固劳动纪律的工作经常化制度化起来。如燧华火柴厂已很少有人无故旷工，开会也不迟到了，工人都服从组织的调度，火柴装盒不合规格的现象也克服了。省农具制造厂在订立各种制度后，小组还订立了公约，并已普遍检查过一次。
    省直属各厂矿现正进行评选劳动模范的工作，有的并结合建立各种责任制，准备在巩固劳动纪律的基础上，更进一步加强计划管理工作。（陈帆）
