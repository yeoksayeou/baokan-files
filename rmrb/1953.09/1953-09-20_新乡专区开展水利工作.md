    Xinxiang Special District Carries Out Water Conservancy Work
    Under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, the Xinxiang Special District of Henan Province has launched mass water conservancy construction work. In the past four years, it has constructed and restored 85 large and small canals, more than 155,900 water wells, 14,000 mountain ponds and cellars, dredged 34 large and small drainage rivers, and improved 500,000 mu of sandy alkaline and waterlogged land. The area of ​​paddy fields has expanded from 1.16 million mu before liberation to 2,568,393 mu. The famous "Divert the Yellow River to Irrigate the Wei River" project, with the "People's Victory Canal" opened for 105 li, has made the Yellow River, which has been a scourge for thousands of years, begin to serve the people docilely. The irrigation area will be expanded to more than 700,000 mu this year, with an average increase of more than double per mu. Because mass water conservancy management organizations were established and improved at the same time as water conservancy construction, the irrigated area has greatly increased, and the flow of each river channel has increased from 3,645 mu before liberation to 24,802 mu. The irrigation area of a well has increased from 17 mu to 35 mu. Due to the development of mass water conservancy work, a quarter of the land in the entire special district has been freed from the threat of drought, agricultural production has increased year by year, and has greatly exceeded the pre-war level. In 1952, the entire special district increased grain production by 93.2 million jin. People's lives have also been improved. For example, after water management in Machang, Huojia, in 1952 alone, more than 40 mules were added. The masses said that they no longer rely on the weather to get by. (Lü Jianzhong)

    新乡专区开展水利工作
    河南省新乡专区在党和人民政府领导下开展了群众性的兴修水利工作，四年来计兴修与恢复大小渠道八十五条，水井十五万五千九百多眼，山地打塘窖一万四千个，疏浚大小排水河三十四条，改良了五十万亩沙碱下湿土地，水田由解放前的一百十六万亩扩大到二百五十六万八千三百九十三亩。有名的“引黄灌溉济卫”工程所开辟的长一百零五里的“人民胜利渠”，使为害千载的黄河开始驯顺地为人民服务，灌溉面积今年将扩大为七十多万亩，平均每亩可增产一倍以上。因为在兴修水利的同时建立与健全了群众自己的水利灌溉管理机构，浇地面积大为增加，河渠每个流量由解放前浇三千六百四十五亩增加到二万四千八百零二亩。一眼井由浇十七亩增至三十五亩。由于群众性水利工作的开展，使全专区四分之一的土地摆脱了旱灾威胁，农业生产量逐年增加，并大大超过战前水平。一九五二年全专区增产粮食已达九千三百二十万斤。人民生活也得到改善，如获嘉马厂治水后，仅一九五二年，即增加骡子四十多头，群众说，再不靠老天爷过时光了。（吕建中）
