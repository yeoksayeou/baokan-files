Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: The National Day, a time of joy for the people, and the annual Mid-Autumn Festival are fast approaching. The Central Ministry of Commerce has issued instructions recently, requiring commercial departments in all regions to make preparations to fully meet the needs of the people nationwide for non-staple foods during the festive celebrations, and to strengthen leadership in this work. They are to effectively organize the forces of state-owned commerce, cooperatives, and private commerce, dividing the proportion of responsibility and formulating plans for supply. The instructions state: This year's National Day is being celebrated after the victorious signing of the Korean armistice negotiations, the start of the nation's planned economic construction, and the continuous increase in people's purchasing power. The people nationwide will universally celebrate the festival, and the demand for non-staple foods will inevitably increase. Therefore, state-owned commercial departments in all regions must attach importance to this work, vigorously organize sources of goods, and make proper arrangements, especially paying attention to the supply of meat, eggs, oil, sugar, liquor, fresh and dried fruits, and fish among non-staple foods. At the same time, they should strengthen market management and strictly restrict price increases and speculative hoarding.

The instructions finally require state-owned commercial departments in all regions to form temporary inspection groups under the leadership of the local financial committees to specifically supervise and inspect this work.

    中央商业部指示各地
    做好国庆节中秋节供应工作
    【新华社三日讯】全国人民历来欢欣鼓舞的国庆节和一年一度的中秋佳节快要到了。中央商业部已在日前发出指示，要求各地商业部门作好准备充分满足全国人民在欢度节日时对副食品的需要，并加强对这一工作的领导，有效地组织国营商业、合作社与私营商业的力量，划分比重制订计划，分别负责供应。指示说：今年的国庆节是在朝鲜停战谈判胜利签字、国家有计划经济建设业已开始、人民购买力不断提高的情况下进行庆祝活动的。全国人民将普遍欢度节日，对副食品的需要，必然增加。为此，各地国营商业部门必须重视这一工作，大力组织货源，妥善安排，特别是对副食品中的肉类、蛋品、油、糖、酒、干鲜果品以及鱼类等更应注意供应，同时并应注意加强市场管理、严格限制抬高物价、投机居奇的行为。
    指示最后要求各地国营商业部门在当地财委领导下，酌情组成临时检查组，专门督促、检查这一工作。
