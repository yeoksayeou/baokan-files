How the State-Run Huangfan District Farm Improved Cotton Quality
    Wang Hairun

The cotton produced by the State-Run Huangfan District Farm last year was of very good quality. According to inspection results, good-quality cotton of the secondary grade and above accounted for 60 percent of the total cotton production, a relatively outstanding achievement. After this batch of cotton was sent to the Taikang Cotton Inspection Station in Henan Province and the Xihua Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, the inspectors also believed that such a large batch of "Grade Four" cotton was rarely seen on the market in the past. They also considered that the impurity and moisture content of this batch of cotton were lower than the statutory standards.

How did the State-Run Huangfan District Farm improve the quality of its cotton?

First, strengthen cotton field management, promptly prune and sucker, and promote early maturity of cotton. The climate in Henan Province is often dry in June and rainy in July and August. Fertilizers in the cotton fields are quickly decomposed and utilized during the rainy season, and cotton generally grows vigorously. If pruning and suckering are not done in time under these circumstances, it will cause cotton boll shedding and late maturity. If the vigorous growth of cotton can be controlled artificially to concentrate nutrients on the cotton bolls, it can promote the early maturity and opening of cotton bolls, reduce the yield of frost-affected cotton, and improve the cotton grade. According to the experience of the State-Run Huangfan District Farm, cotton that is pruned in a timely manner has long fibers, good uniformity, strong toughness, and good quality.

Second, strengthen the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests to maintain the natural color of seed cotton. The color of seed cotton is the primary condition for determining the grade of cotton. Last year, the cotton of the Huangfan District Farm was damaged by pests such as the pink bollworm, cotton bollworm, anthracnose, red rot, and black mold, which discolored and stained the cotton, resulting in inconsistent colors in the ginned cotton (milky white with yellow staining and contamination), affecting the quality of the cotton. In order to maintain the natural color of cotton, it is necessary to strengthen the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests in accordance with the principle of prevention being more important than cure. In addition, poor cotton storage locations can also stain or blacken seed cotton or lint, so the location for storing cotton should be carefully selected and arranged. Now is the cotton picking season, and this point should be paid close attention to.

Third, keep the cotton pure when picking. Maintaining the purity of cotton is one of the important factors in improving the grade. According to the central government's regulations, the impurity standard for lint is 1 percent, and the maximum should not exceed 3 percent. The increase in impurities in cotton is mainly due to the mixing of dead leaves, fragments, dust, boll husks, etc. during cotton picking. Last year, in order to improve the grade, maintain color, and reduce impurities, the Huangfan District Farm formulated requirements for each stage of work and launched a mass campaign to improve cotton quality among farm workers. For example, the following "five requirements" were put forward for cotton picking: 1. Pick mature cotton (i.e., fully opened bolls with dried bracts); 2. Pick and store good and bad cotton separately (i.e., pure white cotton, yellow-stained cotton, and stiff cotton are picked and stored separately); 3. Keep the cotton clean and free of leaf debris and dust; 4. Dry it in the sun (moisture content of 8 or 9 percent) before putting it into storage; 5. Sort the grades and store them separately (i.e., cotton with inconsistent colors should not be mixed). At the same time, requirements were also put forward for field work, such as not missing any cotton fibers, not picking half-open raw cotton, and not damaging or breaking fruit branches.

Fourth, ginning should be meticulous. Careful ginning is also a factor in improving cotton quality. Last year, the cotton at the farm was very dry before ginning and had been cleaned, so the ginned cotton was very good. The ginning speed should maintain a certain amount of cotton feeding and ginning rate to prevent cotton seeds and seed cotton from mixing into the lint, so that the ginned cotton is uniform and tidy.

    国营黄泛区农场是怎样提高棉花品质的
    王海润
    国营黄泛区农场去年生产的棉花品质很好。据检验结果，次上级以上的好花占产棉总数的百分之六十，成绩比较突出。这批棉花送交河南省太康棉检站和西华花纱布公司以后，验收人员也认为像这样大批的“四级”花，过去市场上是很少见的。并且认为这批棉花的含杂和水分都低于法定标准。
    国营黄泛区农场的棉花品质是怎样提高的呢？
    首先是加强棉田管理，及时整枝打杈，促进棉花早熟。河南省的气候，往往是六月干旱，七、八月间多雨，棉田内肥料在雨多季节很快被分解利用，这时棉花一般的有疯长现象。在这种情况下不及时整枝打杈，就会造成棉花落铃、晚熟。如果能用人工控制棉花的疯长，使养料集中供应棉铃，就可促进棉铃的早熟吐絮，减少霜后花的产量，提高棉花品级。根据国营黄泛区农场的经验，凡整枝及时的棉花，都是纤维长、整齐度好、韧度强、品质好的棉花。
    其次是加强病虫害的防治，保持籽棉自然色泽。籽棉的色泽是决定棉花等级的首要条件。去年黄泛区农场的棉花，因遭红铃虫、棉铃虫、炭疽病、红腐病、黑霉病为害，使棉瓤变色染污，以致轧出的棉花色泽不一致（乳精白色内有黄染、污染），影响了棉花品质。为了保持棉花的自然色泽，必须根据防重于治的方针，加强病虫害的防治工作。此外，储棉场所不好，也会使籽棉或皮棉染污、熏黑，因此储存棉花的地点应很好的选择、安排。目前正是收花季节，这一点应十分注意。
    第三、摘花时要保持棉花纯净。保持棉花纯净是提高品级重要因素之一。皮棉的含杂标准按中央规定为百分之一，最高不得超过百分之三。棉花含杂增多，主要是在收花时混进了枯叶、碎片、尘土、铃片等。黄泛区农场去年为提高品级，保持色泽，减少杂质，曾经订出了各段工作的要求，并发动农场工人展开了群众性的提高棉花质量的工作。如摘花时提出“五要”的要求：一、要摘熟花（即充分吐絮、苞叶枯干）；二、要好坏花分收、分存（即纯白花、黄染花、僵片花，分收分存）；三、要保持棉花干净，不带叶屑、尘土；四、要晒干（含水百分之八、九）入仓；五、要分好等级，分别入仓（即色不一致的不混合存放）。同时对田间工作还提出了不漏摘棉絮，不摘半开的生花，和不损折果枝等。
    第四、轧花要精细。轧工精细也是提高棉花质量的因素之一。农场去年在轧花前，棉花都已很干燥，并且经过清花，因此轧出的花都很好。在轧花速度上，要保持一定的喂花量和轧花率，防止棉籽和籽棉混入皮棉，使轧出的棉花均匀整齐。
