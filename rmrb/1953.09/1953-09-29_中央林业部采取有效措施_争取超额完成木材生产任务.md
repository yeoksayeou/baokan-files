    Central Forestry Department Takes Effective Measures
    Striving to Exceed Timber Production Targets

    To guarantee timber for construction, increase national income, and strive to exceed the 1953 timber production targets, the Ministry of Forestry of the Central People's Government has taken effective measures to vigorously rush timber transport, clear backlogs, and strengthen production management.

    This year's national timber production target has increased by 41% compared to last year. In the first half of the year, thanks to the continuous efforts of forestry industry departments at all levels to overcome difficulties and strive for production, the timber needs of major national construction departments were basically guaranteed. Of the total timber supplied to the state in the first half of the year, timber for national defense and industrial construction accounted for more than 70%. However, according to the production plan, only 83.5% of the planned raw timber production was completed in the first half of the year, and only 85% of the planned timber sales were completed. Because production did not meet the plan, storage yards were emptying stock upon arrival of new shipments, resulting in multiple instances of stock-outs. The reasons for not completing the production plan were mainly that the various production links were not well-connected: although felling exceeded the plan, timber collection and transportation could not keep up. Individual forestry industry bureaus in the Northeast did not consider the specific geographical and technical conditions and prematurely abolished old and skilled timber transportation methods, using new timber transportation tools. Some even mistakenly proposed slogans such as "eliminate physical labor" and "abolish animal-drawn transport." As a result, because of a lack of workers and cadres who mastered the technology, the new timber transportation tools could not meet the needs, so the transportation tasks that could have been completed were not (for example, 149,000 cubic meters of timber were backlogged in the production process at the Wangqing Sub-bureau of the Jilin Provincial Forestry Industry Bureau due to this). In addition, the spring drought resulted in low water levels, affecting timber floating down rivers, and summer floods caused damage, destroying river channels and part of the forest railway transportation equipment, resulting in the loss of large quantities of timber, which has not yet been fully recovered, affecting the completion of timber transportation tasks. Sawmills also stopped working due to the lack of raw timber supply, affecting the completion of sawing tasks. In addition, some basic construction projects were not completed on time, which also affected transportation. The Houfangzi flatcar line of the Mudanjiang Hulonggou Sub-bureau failed to be completed in May as planned, preventing the transportation of 20,000 cubic meters of timber. In private forest areas such as East China and Central South China, the production tasks were assigned relatively late, and farmers were busy with spring plowing and summer drought resistance and dam sealing, so timber was piled up in the mountains and could not be transported out. Some areas relaxed timber management, resulting in private merchants rushing to buy and raising timber prices, which also affected procurement tasks.

    Because the production and allocation plans were not completed, coupled with excessive amounts of semi-finished products in production, untimely sales of outside-grade timber, excessive material reserves, and excessively low cost planning controls, only 48.09% of the financial remittance task was completed in the first half of the year.

    In order to guarantee timber for construction, increase national income, and complete and strive to exceed the 1953 timber production targets, the Ministry of Forestry of the Central People's Government has taken effective emergency measures, requiring forestry industry departments in all regions to mobilize all employees to overcome all difficulties and complete the tasks of rushing timber transport and clearing backlogs: In terms of timber water transport, the Northeast must complete the rushing transport and river transport work before the freezing period; all regions within the passes must seize the opportunity to use autumn water to rush transport, vigorously organize creek transport, rush transport to the big river bank, and strive to organize the timber floating down the major rivers; all upstream timber rafts must be transported to the storage yards before the winter dry season. Forest railways should actively restore the damaged transportation routes and equipment, check transportation conditions, promptly dispatch or adjust vehicles, and increase daily transportation volume. In addition to completing the timber allocation tasks, measures to increase income also include vigorously promoting the sales of outside-grade timber and disposing of stagnant materials. Timber that does not meet the needs of national allocation can be sold by timber companies on the market to meet the needs of the masses. In order to better grasp these emergency measures, the Ministry of Forestry has specially organized a production scheduling office, and Vice Minister Li Fanwu personally presides over the scheduling.

    In addition, all regions are also required to do the following work: gradually implement a planned management system in the Northeast, Inner Mongolia, and other regions, establish a production scheduling system to organically link the various production links to ensure the realization of the production plan; implement timber operation and management policies in private forest areas such as East China and Central South China; attach importance to and strengthen the leadership of basic forest construction, re-examine engineering plans, and concentrate efforts to complete projects that can be completed this year and must be completed; continue to rectify organizational structures. After the Northeast and Inner Mongolia have reduced their organizations from five levels to three levels, they should focus on strengthening grassroots production organizations; Central South, East China, and Southwest China should study and focus on piloting the reduction of organizational levels, reducing non-production personnel, and strengthening grassroots leadership; Northwest China should consider the direct leadership of grassroots organizations in Shaanxi and Gansu by the Greater Northwest Administration Bureau, temporarily not establishing provincial bureaus, so as to guide production in a timely manner. Forestry industry organizations in all regions must, in accordance with the spirit of the Central Government's recent instructions on increasing production and practicing economy, urgently mobilize, rely on the leadership and support of the local Party committees, give play to the wisdom and creative spirit of all employees, and strive to exceed the timber production targets.

### 中央林业部采取有效措施  争取超额完成木材生产任务

    中央林业部采取有效措施
    争取超额完成木材生产任务
    为了保证建设用材、增加国家收入、争取超额完成一九五三年木材生产任务，中央人民政府林业部已采取有效措施，大力抢运木材，清理积压，加强生产管理。
    今年全国木材生产任务比去年增加了百分之四十一。上半年，由于各级森林工业部门不断克服困难，努力生产，基本上保证了国家主要建设部门的木材需要。总计在上半年供应国家的木材中，国防和工业建设用材占百分之七十以上。但根据生产计划来检查，上半年原木生产只完成计划百分之八十三点五，木材销售也只完成计划百分之八十五。由于生产没有完成计划，贮木场随到随拨，没有库存，造成了多次拨空现象。没有完成生产计划的原因：主要是各生产环节互不衔接，采伐虽超过计划，集材运材却跟不上。东北个别森林工业局没有考虑到具体地理条件和技术条件，曾过早地取消了旧有熟练的运材方法，使用新的运木材的工具，甚至有的错误地提出“消灭体力劳动”、“取消牛马套子”的口号，结果，因为缺乏掌握技术的工人和干部，新的运材工具不能适应需要，使得原来可以完成的运输任务没能完成（如吉林省森林工业局汪清分局的二十万立方公尺木材就因此在生产过程中积压十四万九千立方公尺）；加以今年春旱水小，影响木材推河，夏季水灾为害，冲毁河道及部分森林铁道运输设备，大量木材流失，至今尚未完全抢出，影响了木材运输任务的完成。制材场也因原木供应不上，停工待料，影响制材任务的完成。另外，有些基本建设没有按时完成，也影响了运输。牡丹江火龙沟分局后房子平车线未能按计划在五月完工，使二万立方公尺木材不能运出。在华东、中南等私有林地区，由于生产任务布置较晚，农民忙于春耕及夏季抗旱封坝，木材堆积山中运不出来。部分地区放松对木材管理，产生私商抢购、抬高木价的现象，也影响了收购任务。
    由于生产、调拨计划没有完成，再加生产中的在制品数量过多，推销等外材不及时，材料超储备的积压和成本计划控制过低，致使上半年财政上缴任务只完成百分之四十八点零九。
    为了保证建设用材、增加国家收入、完成并争取超额完成一九五三年木材生产任务，中央人民政府林业部已采取了有效的紧急措施，要求各地森林工业部门，动员全体职工，克服一切困难，完成木材抢运和清理积压任务：木材水运方面，东北要在冻期前完成抢运和出河工作；关内各地要抓紧利用秋水抢运，大力组织溪运，抢运至大河边，争取时间组织大江河的木材放运工作，必须在冬季枯水期前把上游木排全部运至贮木场。森林铁路应积极恢复被冲毁的运输路线和设备，检查运输情况，及时调度或调剂车辆，提高日运量。增加收入的办法除完成木材调拨任务外，还要大力推销等外材和处理呆滞物资，凡不合国家调配需要的木材，可由木材公司在市场推销，供应群众需要。为了很好地掌握这一紧急措施，中央林业部特组织生产调度室，并由李范五副部长亲自主持调度。
    此外，还要求各地做好下列工作：在东北、内蒙等地区逐步实行计划管理制度，建立生产调度制度，使各个生产环节有机地联系起来，以保证生产计划的实现；在华东、中南等私有林地区贯彻木材经营管理政策；重视和加强对森林基本建设的领导，重审工程计划，凡属今年可能完成而又必须完成的工程，应集中力量坚决完成；继续整顿组织机构，东北和内蒙从五层机构减为三层机构以后，应着重加强基层生产机构；中南、华东、西南应研究和重点试行减少机构层次，减少非生产人员，加强基层领导；西北应考虑由大区管理局直接领导陕西、甘肃基层机构，暂不设省局，以便及时指导生产。各地森林工业机构，都必须依照中央最近关于增产节约指示的精神，紧急动员起来，依靠当地党委的领导与支持，发挥全体职工的智慧和创造精神，努力争取超额完成木材生产任务。
