Guangdong Province Begins Rectifying Local State-Operated Industries

The CPC Central Committee's South China Sub-Bureau convened the Guangdong Provincial Local Industry Conference on August 4th, determining that the main task of Guangdong's local state-operated industries in the coming period would still be rectification. The conference also conducted a preliminary ranking of local state-operated industries and discussed and approved the plan for rectifying Guangdong's local industries.

Guangdong's local state-operated industries have seen some development since liberation. Major industries such as sugar production, silk reeling, silk weaving, and rosin have been restored or have grown. In the past, because the leadership of Party committees at all levels focused mainly on rural areas, their leadership over local industry was relatively weak. The Provincial Department of Industry also only managed large factories for a long time, neglecting small factories (this has changed since this year). In addition, due to unclear guidelines, local industry has many problems, such as the uneven distribution of factories, resulting in a disconnect between supply, production, and sales, poor management, high costs, poor quality and specifications, wasted power, and low equipment utilization. After the Guangdong Provincial Guangzhou Municipal Financial and Economic Conference in August of last year proposed rectifying local industry, the rectification was not carried out in accordance with the original guidelines and requirements throughout the province's local state-operated industries, because leaders at all levels did not pay enough attention. Therefore, to date, there are still many problems in local state-operated industries.

The conference criticized the erroneous thinking that local industry has no prospects for development and the passive and indifferent attitude towards local industry. After studying the situation and existing problems of Guangdong's local industry, the conference clarified the guidelines for local industry, believing that Guangdong's local state-operated industries must be rectified. The rectification guidelines should be based on Guangdong's specific circumstances, and the general guideline of "local industry serving agricultural production increase and processing for national enterprises" should be resolutely implemented in a planned and step-by-step manner. At the same time, it is necessary to take into account the needs of urban and rural people's lives and means of production, and to supplement the deficiencies in national construction needs. Under this general guideline, improve business management, tap potential, reduce costs, improve quality, and open up sales channels, thereby steadily and actively seeking development.

### 广东省开始整顿地方国营工业

    广东省开始整顿地方国营工业
    中共中央华南分局于八月四日召开广东省地方工业会议，确定广东地方国营工业今后一定时期内的主要任务仍以整顿为主。会议并对地方国营工业进行了初步的排队，讨论和通过了整顿广东省地方工业方案。
    广东省地方国营工业，在解放后有了一些发展，主要行业如制糖、缫丝、丝织、松香等都已恢复或有了发展。过去由于各级党委的领导力量，主要放在农村，对地方工业的领导较弱；省工业厅又长期只管大厂，不管小厂（今年以来有了改变），加上方针不明确，地方工业存在的问题很多，如工厂分布的地区不平衡等，因而使供、产、销脱节，经营管理不善，成本高，质量规格不好，动力浪费，设备利用率低等。去年八月，在广东省广州市财经会议上提出整顿地方工业以后，因各级领导重视不够，实际上除个别县进行了一些整顿工作外，全省地方国营工业并未按原定方针要求进行整顿。因此，到目前为止，地方国营工业存在的问题仍很多。
    会议批判了认为地方工业没有发展前途，对地方工业采取消极冷淡态度的错误思想，研究了广东地方工业的情况和存在的问题后，明确了地方工业的方针，认为广东地方国营工业必须加以整顿。整顿的方针应根据广东的具体情况，有计划、有步骤地坚决贯彻“地方工业为农业增产服务，为国家企业加工”的总方针；同时要照顾城乡人民生活和生产资料的需要，并补助国家建设需要的不足。在这总方针下，改善经营管理，发掘潜力，降低成本，提高质量，打开销路，从而稳步积极地求得发展。
