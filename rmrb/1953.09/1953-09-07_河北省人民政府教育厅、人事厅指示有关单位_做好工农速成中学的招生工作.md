The Hebei Provincial People's Government Education Department and Personnel Department, in order to run workers' and peasants' short-course secondary schools well and ensure the quantity and quality of enrolled students, and to correct the phenomenon of some units selecting and sending students who do not meet the prescribed conditions, recently jointly issued instructions on the enrollment of students for workers' and peasants' short-course secondary schools, requiring education administrative departments and personnel departments at all levels to earnestly do a good job in this year's enrollment work.

The instructions point out: Since the establishment of workers' and peasants' short-course secondary schools in Hebei Province three years ago, there has been considerable development in quantity, but due to insufficient publicity about the nature, principles, and tasks of workers' and peasants' short-course secondary schools, coupled with the existence of departmentalism among the responsible comrades of some factories, mines, and organizations, who are unwilling to transfer a sufficient number of industrial workers and worker-peasant cadres who meet the conditions to apply for the schools, and the failure of workers' and peasants' short-course secondary schools in various places to strictly grasp the conditions for admitting new students, some of the students recruited in the past did not meet the political requirements, or their cultural level was too low, or they were too ill to persist in their studies; some had unhealthy thoughts; and some were even unwilling to enroll in the schools. This situation has added many difficulties to the school's teaching work and affected the state's plan for training talent.

In order to correct these shortcomings in the past enrollment work and ensure that the quantity and quality of students selected and sent meet the regulations, the instructions put forward the following two requirements to the relevant units in various places: First, all localities should, through meetings and other means, repeatedly explain to the responsible comrades of relevant units and the workers and cadres applying for workers' and peasants' short-course secondary schools the principles and tasks of workers' and peasants' short-course secondary schools and the conditions for admitting new students to workers' and peasants' short-course secondary schools. In order to attract more industrial workers to enroll, workers' and peasants' short-course secondary schools will gradually implement a "worker return system" starting this year, that is, graduates of higher education institutions will still be sent back to their original recommending departments to work. Second, all localities and sending units should earnestly implement the regulations of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Higher Education and the Ministry of Education on the admission conditions for students of workers' and peasants' short-course secondary schools, especially the three main conditions of ideological progress, active work, and good health. In addition, special attention should be paid to absorbing more industrial workers, labor models, and model workers to enroll. The political conditions of applicants should be strictly reviewed; the length of service of workers and the length of time worker-peasant cadres have participated in revolutionary work must be more than three years; the cultural level must reach the equivalent of graduation from senior primary school, and a strict physical examination should be conducted.

    河北省人民政府教育厅、人事厅指示有关单位
    做好工农速成中学的招生工作
    河北省人民政府教育厅、人事厅，为了办好工农速成中学，保证入校学生的数量和质量，纠正某些单位不按规定条件选送学生的现象，在最近联合发出了关于工农速成中学招生的指示，要求各级教育行政部门和人事部门，切实作好今年度的招生工作。
    指示指出：河北省工农速成中学开办三年以来，数量上已有相当发展，但由于对工农速成中学的性质、方针、任务宣传得不够，加上有些厂矿和机关的负责人存在着本位主义思想，不愿抽调足够数量同时够条件的产业工人和工农干部去投考，各地工农速成中学也没有严格掌握录取新生的条件，因此过去所招收的学员中，有一部分学员政治条件不够，或文化程度太低，身体多病不能坚持学习；有的思想不健康；甚至有的不愿意入校学习。这种情况给学校教学工作增加很多困难，使国家培养人材的计划受到影响。
    为了纠正过去招生工作中的这种缺点，保证选送学生的数量与质量合乎规定，指示中对各地有关单位提出了以下两点要求：一、各地应通过会议等方式，对有关单位的负责同志及投考工农速成中学的工人和干部，反复说明工农速成中学的方针任务、工农速成中学录取新生的条件。为了争取更多的产业工人入学，工农速成中学从今年起逐步实行“工人返还制”，即高等学校毕业后仍送回原来保送部门工作。二、各地、各选送单位应切实执行中央人民政府高等教育部、教育部关于工农速成中学学生入学条件的规定，尤其要掌握思想进步、工作积极、身体健康三个主要条件。另外，应特别注意吸收更多的产业工人、劳动模范和模范工作者入学。对投考学生的政治条件，应进行严格的审查；工人的工龄和工农干部参加革命工作年限必须满三年以上；文化程度必须达到相当于高小毕业的水平，并应严格进行体格检查。
