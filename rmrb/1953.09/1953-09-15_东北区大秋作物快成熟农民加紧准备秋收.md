Xinhua News Agency Report:

    The various autumn crops in the Northeast Region are nearing maturity, and farmers are intensifying their preparations for the autumn harvest.

    Throughout the Northeast region, with the exception of some farmland affected by flooding, crops are generally growing well. If there are no other disasters in the future, a good harvest is expected. It is estimated that grain production in Rehe Province will exceed last year's. In Heilongjiang, Beizhen, Yi County and other places in Western Liaoning Province, the main grain crops are growing vigorously, with a generally higher number of plants per unit area than in previous years, and yields are expected to increase. The counties in western Jilin Province and southern Heilongjiang Province, which have historically had lower yields, have seen generally good crop growth this year. It is estimated that crops in Changling County in western Jilin Province will increase by several tens of percent compared to last year.

    Among the various grain crops, the commodity crops of soybeans and rice are growing well. Rice in Liaodong Province and the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Region of Jilin Province is growing better than last year, and the yield per unit area is expected to increase compared to last year. Among the various industrial raw material crops, flax has been harvested. Nearly 20,000 hectares (1 hectare = 15 mu) of flax in Songjiang Province yielded an average of 3,200 jin of flax stems per hectare, an increase of 600 jin over last year. Cotton in various places is also generally growing well, with some bolls beginning to crack and fluff. According to a typical survey of Xiaoxingzhuang Village in Jin County, Western Liaoning Province: the general yield of cotton fields in the village can reach more than 3,000 jin (seed cotton) per hectare, and 31 hectares can yield 5,000 to 6,000 jin per hectare. This is an unprecedented good harvest in the area.

    This year in the Northeast region, due to the heavy rainfall and wet ground, the crop stalks are generally thick and tall, and some crops have been flattened due to the rain. In addition, the widespread promotion of wide sowing and dense planting has increased the number of plants per unit area, making this year's autumn harvest work particularly heavy and intensive. In view of this situation, the Party and government leading organs in various places are actively leading farmers in preparing for the autumn harvest. First, they are generally rectifying mutual aid and cooperative organizations and rationally organizing the labor force. Secondly, in order to supply agricultural tools for the autumn harvest in a timely manner, supply and marketing cooperatives in various places have generally prepared a large number of agricultural tools such as sickles and shovels to supply to farmers. In addition, various places are vigorously carrying out the work of opening autumn ridges and pulling large weeds to promote early crop maturity and ensure the harvest.

    东北区大秋作物快成熟农民加紧准备秋收
    据新华社讯：东北区各种大秋作物已接近成熟，农民们正加紧准备秋收。
    东北全区除遭受水涝的部分农田外，大部地区庄稼都生长良好，今后如无其他灾害，可望获得较好的收成。热河省粮食产量，据估计可超过去年。辽西省黑山、北镇、义县等地的主要粮食作物都生长茂盛，一般单位面积株数比往年多，产量可望提高。历年收成较低的吉林省西部和黑龙江省南部地区各县，今年庄稼普遍长得很好。吉林省西部的长岭县的庄稼据估计可比去年增产好几成。
    在各种粮食作物中，商品粮大豆和水稻都生长得好。辽东省和吉林省延边朝鲜民族自治区的水稻，都长得比去年好，单位面积产量可比去年提高。在各种工业原料作物中，亚麻已经收割完毕。松江省近两万垧（每垧十五市亩）亚麻，平均每垧收割麻茎三千二百斤，比去年提高六百斤。各地棉花也普遍生长很好，部分已开始裂桃吐絮。据辽西省锦县小兴庄的典型调查：该村棉田一般产量每垧都能达三千斤（籽棉）以上，其中有三十一垧每垧产量可达五千斤到六千斤。这是当地从未有过的好收成。
    东北区今年因为雨多地湿，庄稼秸棵普遍粗大，有些庄稼还因阴雨发生了倒伏现象，加上各地重点推行了宽播、密植，增加了作物的单位面积株数，使今年的秋收工作特别繁重和紧张。根据这一情况，目前各地党政领导机关正积极领导农民进行秋收准备工作，首先普遍整顿互助合作组织，合理地组织劳动力。其次，为了及时供应秋收农具，各地的供销合作社普遍准备了大量镰刀、铁锹等农具供应农民。此外，各地还大力进行放秋垅、拔大草的工作，以促使庄稼早熟，保证收成。
