Reader's Letters Abstract

Serious Infringement of the Interests of Local People
During the Nanwan Reservoir Construction Project

A letter from Nan Shan, Secretary of the Fifteenth District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Xinyang County, Henan; Zhang Dehong, Township Head of Songshutan Township, Fifteenth District, Xinyang County; and Chen Weibin, Chairman of the Farmers' Association: During the construction of the Nanwan Reservoir in Xinyang, Henan, many incidents of infringing upon the interests of farmers have occurred.

Last autumn, due to work needs, the Nanwan Reservoir Headquarters and Security Section were responsible for establishing a market. However, the more than ten mu of land for the market were all taken from local farmers. The cotton crop of one and a half mu belonging to farmer Li Wenshe was pulled up by cadres establishing the market, and he has not yet received compensation; this spring, his jute field was arbitrarily turned into a ball field by people from the market. Li Wenshe went to the Nanwan Reservoir Relocation Committee and the Security Section six times to demand compensation, but they ignored him. Many households whose land was occupied went to the township government, and township cadres reported to the Nanwan Reservoir Relocation Committee, the Security Section, and the Headquarters, but they were not taken seriously. Similar incidents include: When Xiong Xuqi and Xiong Xushan of Erdaogou Village, Songshutan Township, wanted to plant wheat on their six mu of wheat field last year, the Nanwan Reservoir Relocation Committee instructed "this land is to be occupied" and forbade them to plant. However, until now, they have neither requisitioned nor notified them; the land has been left barren, wasting three seasons of production. Other instances include the reservoir stonemason team of Shuixianqiao Township occupying farmers' mountains and land, with no compensation paid to this day.

The Nanwan Reservoir also frequently bypasses the district and township governments and randomly finds farmers in the villages to work. In Songshutan Township alone, twenty-nine farmers have been found to work at the reservoir. After some farmers went to work, there were no other laborers at home, and the land was completely barren; Xiong Xushan of Erdaogou Village planted rice seedlings on his two mu of land, but has not weeded them even once. On July 26th, the reservoir, disregarding the farmers' production situation, temporarily found eighty-eight farmers in Songshutan Township to work; this has caused great difficulties for the local government in leading agricultural production.

Zhang Qinghua and others of the Nanwan Reservoir Automotive Section also fail to comply with the government's forest protection policy and buy trees from Shuixianqiao Township without the approval of the local district and township governments. Farmer Zhang Shide said: "The government calls for closing the mountains for afforestation and prohibits indiscriminate felling of trees." But Zhang Qinghua said: "We are a reservoir above the special commissioner level and can buy them. You cut them down, and we'll take responsibility. We'll pay a little more." As a result, local farmers cut down more than 1,200 trees; but in the end, they only bought 860 trees. This has not only made local farmers very dissatisfied but has also hindered the implementation of the policy of protecting mountain forests.

The higher-level leading organs of the Nanwan Reservoir should seriously deal with these many acts of infringing upon the interests of the masses.

Using Mountain Floods for Irrigation in the Third District of Hejin

A letter from readers Ren Yingjie, Wei Tianxi, and three others: In early August, the Water Conservancy Committee of the Third District of Hejin County, Shanxi Province, planned and organized the use of mountain floods to irrigate more than 45,000 mu of land. The general irrigation volume of these fields reached about one chi, with mud covering one to three cun thick. This not only laid a reliable foundation for preserving soil moisture in the wheat fields but also improved the soil with fertile silt and reduced flood disasters. We suggest that in areas with suitable conditions, the method of diverting floods for siltation and irrigation should be promoted to turn water disasters into water conservancy.

Hengshan County Farm Should Improve Its Work
Setting a Demonstrative Role in Agricultural Production

A letter from Cao Peiji, Beiwang Township, Hengshan County, Hunan Province: The work of the Hengshan County Farm is not done well. During this year's spring plowing, an old farmer nearby discovered that the farm's seedlings were rotting. He enthusiastically reported this to the comrades at the farm, but a technician surnamed Luo at the farm said: "We are confident they won't rot! What business is it of yours!" As a result, when it was time to transplant the seedlings, the farm realized that more than 93 percent of their seedlings had rotted and had to temporarily switch to planting dry rice. When double-cropping rice seeds were sown in the fourth month of the lunar calendar, the farm only prepared intercropping rice seedlings for planting on dozens of mu of land but sowed seedlings for seven mu of land; as a result, seedlings for two mu and four fen of land were left over and had to be plowed into the soil as fertilizer. When it rained too much during the local autumn harvest, the farm allowed the intercropping rice to rot in the fields without timely harvesting. Their early rice harvest was also very late. The rice straw harvested by the farm this autumn also rotted a lot due to poor storage, and they will have to buy straw to feed the cattle in the future.

The local farmers have a lot of opinions about the farm's work. Bin Jinxian, chairman of the Beiwang Township Women's Federation, said: "The farm wasted too much this year. The first and second rice crops only yielded three or four hundred jin of rice per mu, which is simply outrageous." Some farmers said: We hope the county farm will be run well and set a good example for us. What can we learn from a farm like this?

Huanan County Cooperative Should Seriously Handle
New Embezzlement Incidents After the "Three-Anti" Campaign

A letter from readers Zhou En and Liu Guoqing: The cooperative system in Huanan County, Songjiang Province, continues to experience embezzlement incidents even after the "Three-Anti" campaign. According to the key inspection results of the Huanan County Cooperative Union in seven grassroots cooperatives, as many as twenty people were found to be embezzlers, accounting for more than 11 percent of the cadres in these seven cooperatives; the amount of embezzled funds that have been voluntarily confessed reached more than 25.7 million yuan. Among the twenty embezzling cadres, nine were repeat offenders after the "Three-Anti" campaign, and one was a "tiger" during the "Three-Anti" campaign; eleven embezzled less than one million yuan, and nine embezzled more than one million yuan, with the most embezzling more than 8.2 million yuan. The embezzlement of some individuals was extremely egregious. For example, Gai Guangwu, the accountant of the Dongsheng Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative, embezzled before the "Three-Anti" campaign, did not honestly confess his problems during the "Three-Anti" campaign, and became even more daring and reckless after the "Three-Anti" campaign. In the autumn of 1952, when purchasing grain from the masses, he unauthorizedly created 83 million yuan in grain coupons, allowing the masses to use them as RMB in the surrounding five administrative villages. If the grain coupons were wet or torn, he would not exchange them for money, causing considerable losses to the farmers; he and the cashier, Qu Yongzhen (female), colluded to steal cash from outside using grain coupons.

The phenomenon of blurring the lines between public and private interests and the situation of borrowing goods without proper procedures are also very common among cooperative cadres. Some cadres treat the cooperative as if it were their own, taking goods by writing slips without anyone's approval or knowledge. For example, Li Shufeng, an employee of the Yao Village Cooperative in the First District, has been borrowing goods from the cooperative since 1949, and now owes the cooperative more than 5 million yuan in unpaid goods.

The above situation has seriously affected the normal operation of the cooperative's business. For example, the Zhangjia Village Cooperative in the Eighth District has very few goods in stock due to a lack of cash for purchasing goods; local people have to go to distant villages and towns to buy things, and they have many complaints.

In order to correct the above deviations, the Huanan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party instructed the County Union to further strengthen its leadership over the grassroots cooperatives. First, the County Union can organize a working group to conduct key inspections of the work of the grassroots cooperatives, criticize bad people and bad deeds, and commend good people and good deeds; embezzlement offenders whose cases are serious should be sent to judicial departments for punishment according to law, in order to educate all cadres. Second, when conditions are ripe, it is necessary to guide the grassroots cooperatives to conduct a thorough property inventory, establish and improve various systems, and earnestly play the role of the supervisory board and the board of directors to supervise the work of the grassroots cooperatives. The district party committees should also strengthen their guidance to rural supply and marketing cooperatives and strengthen political education for cooperative cadres, in order to improve their political awareness and establish the viewpoint of serving the masses.

Personnel Section of Zhejiang Provincial Construction Engineering Company
Should Pay Serious Attention to Employees' Household Registration Work

A letter from reader Qian Binglin: Administrative leaders of the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Engineering Company do not pay attention to employees' household registration work. The personnel section does not have a dedicated person in charge of household registration work, and employees rarely go through household registration transfer procedures when they are transferred to work, so the household registration situation is very chaotic. For example, Huang Zuji of the construction section handed in his household registration certificate to personnel section assistant Chen Lingdi in June last year. In April of this year, he was transferred to work at a project office in another location and asked the personnel section to process his household registration transfer-out procedures. The personnel section could not find his household registration certificate and pushed the responsibility to the security section; the security section then asked him to check with the personnel section. Finally, they said they would wait until they found it later, but his household registration certificate is still missing to this day. After the household registration books of all employees of the First Branch of the former Zhejiang Provincial Construction Company (now abolished) were lost in October last year, the personnel section did not declare the loss to the public security department or go through the procedures. Many employees who were transferred to work still cannot transfer out their household registrations. Some comrades have raised opinions with the personnel section, but the personnel section has never provided an appropriate solution to this problem. In addition, some employees have never submitted their household registration certificates, and the personnel section does not inquire about them.

I believe that this phenomenon of the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Engineering Company not complying with the household registration system is wrong. The company's leadership should quickly urge the personnel section to sort out employees' household registrations and conscientiously do a good job in household registration.

Military Dependents in Kuqa County, Xinjiang
Zhu Xueli's Prosperous Life Grateful to the Government

A letter from Zhu Xueli: I am a military dependent from No. 1 Street, Chengguan District, Kuqa County, Xinjiang. There are eight people in my family, and I am the only full laborer. Before liberation, I ran a rented mill and lived a difficult life. After liberation, the people's government allocated three mu of cultivated land to me and provided relief of 130 jin of wheat. With the help of the people's government, my wife and I made a plan to work hard to cultivate the land and run the mill. At present, we not only have no worries about food and clothing but also bought a horse and saved 1,680 jin of wheat. We have escaped poverty and embarked on a happy and prosperous life.

In March of this year, the county people's government convened a county-wide representative conference of families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel. I was selected as a model military dependent. The county leaders personally awarded me prizes, and the people of No. 1 Street also presented me with a banner. These have made me feel extremely honored. This honor was brought to me by Chairman Mao and the people's government. I have written to my son, Zhu Guangyuan, and my daughter, Zhu Yuxia, telling them to work harder to study politics and modern military technology in the army and work actively to strive for merit in order to repay Chairman Mao and the people's government for their concern for me.

Family of a Revolutionary Disabled Soldier
He Xianying Actively Engages in Production

A letter from reader Yang Zhubao: The exemplary behavior of He Xianying, the family member of a revolutionary disabled soldier, is worthy of everyone's learning. He Xianying is from Fuxiang Township, Lingchuan County, Shanxi Province. Before liberation, her family was very poor and lacked food and clothing all year round. After Lingchuan County was liberated, her family was able to turn over a new leaf. In order to safeguard the beautiful new life, He Xianying mobilized her husband, Zhao Quanfa, to join the People's Liberation Army, and she took on the burden of labor for the six mu of land at home. In 1950, He Xianying joined a mutual aid team. That year, her family's income per mu increased by 3 dou and 2 sheng compared to when her husband was at home. She also gets along very well with her mother-in-law. Because of this, Zhao Quanfa was greatly encouraged and did not leave the front line even after being wounded several times in battle. In August 1951, Zhao Quanfa returned home after being disabled in both legs. At first, he was afraid that He Xianying would change her mind. Later, seeing that He Xianying was still working and managing household affairs as actively as before and that her feelings for him had not changed in the slightest, he dispelled his ideological concerns. Last autumn, He Xianying persuaded her mother-in-law to join the agricultural production cooperative. She led the twenty-nine women in the cooperative to obtain equal pay for equal work. Now, all the women in the cooperative, except for those who are sick or pregnant, are involved in the production movement.

    读者来信摘要
    南湾水库修建工程中
    严重侵犯当地群众的利益
    中共河南信阳县十五区委员会南山，信阳县十五区松树坦乡乡长张得宏，农会主席陈维斌来信：河南信阳南湾水库在工程建设中发生许多侵犯农民利益的事件。
    去年秋天，南湾水库因为工作需要，由指挥部和保卫科负责建立一个市场。但是，市场的十余亩土地都是占用当地农民的。农民李文社的一亩半棉花被水库建立市场的干部拔掉，直到现在还没有得到赔偿；今年春天，他的一块黄麻地又被市场的人任意辟为球场。李文社为了这件事六次到南湾水库迁移委员会和保卫科要求赔偿，他们竟置之不理。许多被占地户找乡政府，乡干部反映到南湾水库迁移委员会、保卫科和指挥部，但都没被重视。类似事件还有：松树坦乡二道河村熊绪齐、熊绪山的六亩麦田去年要种麦子时，南湾水库迁移委员会指示
  “要占这块地”，不叫种。可是到现在，他们既不征购也不通知人家；这块地就这样荒着，耽误了三季的生产。其他如睡仙桥乡水库石工队占用农民的山和地，至今也没有赔偿。
    南湾水库还经常不通过区乡政府而随便到村里找农民去做工。松树坦乡被找到水库做工的农民达二十九人。有些农民去做工后家里没有其他劳动力，土地就全部荒芜了；二道河村熊绪山的二亩地栽上秧后，至今还没锄一次草。七月二十六日这一天，水库不顾农民生产情况，临时在松树坦乡找八十八个农民去做工；这样就使地方政府领导农业生产的工作发生很大困难。
    南湾水库汽车科张清华等还不遵守政府护林政策，不经当地区乡政府批准，私自到睡仙桥乡买树。农民张世德说：“政府号召封山育林，不叫乱砍树木。”而张清华却说：“我们是专署以上的水库，可以买。你砍吧，由我们负责。我们多掏几个钱。”于是，当地农民就砍了一千二百多棵树；但结果他们只买八百六十棵。这不但使当地农民很不满意，并且妨碍了保护山林政策的贯彻。
    南湾水库这许多侵犯群众利益的行为，他们的上级领导机关应该严肃地加以处理。
  河津三区利用山洪灌田
    读者任英杰、魏天锡等五人来信：山西省河津县三区水利委员会在八月初有计划、有组织地利用山洪灌溉了四万五千余亩土地。这些田地一般的灌水量达一尺左右，漫泥一寸至三寸厚。这样不但给麦田保墒打下可靠的基础，而且用肥沃的淤土改良了土壤，并减轻了洪水灾害。我们建议在有条件地区，应推行引洪淤灌的方法，变水患为水利。
  衡山县农场应该改进工作
    在农业生产中起示范作用
    湖南省衡山县北望乡曹培基来信：衡山县农场工作做得很不好。今年春耕时，附近的一个老农发现农场的秧烂了，他热心地把这个情况向农场的同志反映，该场一个姓罗的技术员反而说：“我们有把握不会烂！你们管什么闲事！”结果要插秧了，农场才知道自己的秧烂了百分之九十三以上，只好临时改种旱稻。在旧历四月间下双季稻种时，农场只预备插几十亩田的间作稻，却种了七亩田的秧子；结果剩下了二亩四分田的秧，只好犁了当肥料。当地秋收时雨水过多，农场却任凭间作稻在田里烂，不及时收割。他们的早稻收割也很迟。农场今秋收下的稻草也因保管不好而烂了很多，将来还得买稻草来喂牛。
    当地农民群众对农场的工作很有意见。北望乡妇女会主席宾金鲜说：“农场今年浪费太大，头二道稻每亩只收三、四百斤稻谷，简直不像话。”有的农民说：我们希望县农场办得好，给我们作个好样子，像这样的农场我们向他学什么东西呢？
  桦南县合作社应严肃处理
   “三反”后的新贪污事件
    读者周恩、刘国卿来信：松江省桦南县合作社系统在“三反”以后仍不断发生贪污事件。仅据桦南县合作社联合社在七个基层社的重点检查结果，贪污者即达二十人，占这七个社干部的百分之十一以上；已自动坦白交代的贪污款数达二千五百七十余万元。二十个贪污的干部中，有九名是“三反”后的重犯，一名是“三反”时的“老虎”；贪污百万元以下的十一名，百万元以上的九名，最多的达八百二十多万元。个别人贪污情节极其恶劣，如东升村供销合作社会计盖广武在“三反”前就贪污，“三反”运动中不老实交代问题，“三反”后更变本加厉地大胆妄为。一九五二年秋，收购群众粮食时，他擅自制造粮条子八千三百万元，让群众在周围五个行政村当人民币流通使用，粮条子遭水湿或磨破了他就不给换钱，农民受到不少损失；他和出纳员曲永珍
  （女）合谋用粮条子向外盗换现金。
    合作社干部中公私不分的现象和不合手续赊欠货物的情况也很普遍。某些干部把合作社当成自家开的，买东西不经任何人批准和知道，就自行打条子拿货。如一区腰村合作社职员李树枫由一九四九年开始就赊取合作社的货，到现在已欠合作社五百多万货款未偿还。
    以上情况，严重影响了合作社业务的正常进行。如八区张家村合作社因无现金取货，库存物资很少；当地群众只得到很远的村镇去买东西，意见很多。
    为了纠正上述偏向，中共桦南县委指示县联社要进一步加强对基层社的领导。首先，县联社可组织工作组对基层社工作作重点检查，批判坏人坏事，表扬好人好事；对情况严重的贪污分子应送请司法部门依法惩办，以教育全体干部。其次，在条件成熟时，要领导各基层社进行彻底的清理财产工作，建立和健全各种制度，并认真发挥监事会、理事会的作用，以监督基层社的工作。各区党委也要加强对农村供销合作社的指导，加强对合作社干部的政治教育，以提高他们的政治觉悟，树立为群众服务的观点。浙江省建筑工程公司人事科
  应该切实重视职工户口工作
    读者钱炳麟来信：浙江省建筑工程公司行政领导干部不重视职工户口工作。人事科对户口工作没有专人负责，职工调动工作时很少办理户口登记迁移手续，因此户口情况非常混乱。如施工科黄祖骥在去年六月把户口证缴给人事科助理员陈令弟，今年四月间他被调到外地工程处工作，就要人事科办理户口迁出手续。人事科查不到他的户口证，就向保卫科推；保卫科又让他到人事科查。最后说是等以后查到了再说，但直到现在他的户口证还是没有下落。前浙江省建筑公司第一分公司（现已撤销）全体职工的户口簿在去年十月间被遗失后，人事科也没有向公安部门申明遗失和办理手续，许多调动工作的职工直到现在还迁不出户口。有些同志曾向人事科提出意见，但人事科始终没有对这个问题作适当解决。此外，还有一部分职工一直不缴户口证，人事科也不加查问。
    我认为，浙江省建筑工程公司这种不遵守户口制度的现象是不对的。该公司领导方面应该赶快督促人事科清理职工户口，认真做好户口登记工作。新疆库车县军属
  朱学礼生活富裕感激政府
    朱学礼来信：我是新疆库车县城关区一街的一个军属，家里八口人，只有我一个整劳动力。解放前，我经营着一座租来的磨坊，生活很困难，解放后，人民政府给我调了三亩耕地，救济了一百三十斤小麦。在人民政府的帮助下，我和我的爱人就订了努力种地和经营磨坊计划。目前，我们不仅不愁吃穿，还买了一匹马，积蓄了一千六百八十斤小麦。我们已摆脱了贫穷，走上了幸福、富裕的生活道路了。
    今年三月，县人民政府召开全县烈属军属代表大会，我被评选为军属模范。县首长们亲自给我发了奖品，一街群众还给我送了一面锦旗。这些都使我感到莫大的光荣。这种光荣是毛主席和人民政府带给我的。我已经把这些事情写信告诉我的儿子朱光远和女儿朱玉霞，叫他们在部队里加倍努力地学习政治和现代化的军事技术，积极工作，争取立功，来报答毛主席和人民政府对我的关怀。
  革命残废军人家属
    和先英积极生产
    读者杨珠宝来信：革命残废军人家属和先英的模范行为值得大家学习。和先英是山西省陵川县附城乡人，解放前家里很穷，整年缺吃少穿。陵川县解放后，她家才翻了身。为了保障美好的新生活，和先英动员丈夫赵全法参加了解放军，家里六亩地的劳动担子由她担起来。一九五零年和先英参加了互助组，这一年她家每亩地的收入比丈夫在时增加了三斗二升。她和婆婆也处得很好。因为这样，赵全法受到很大鼓舞，在战斗中几次挂花都不下火线。一九五一年八月，赵全法因为双腿残废复员回家。开始，他唯恐和先英要变心。后来，看看和先英还是像以前那样积极地劳动和处理家务，对他的感情没丝毫改变，他才打消了思想顾虑。去年秋天和先英说服婆婆，参加了农业生产合作社。她领导全社二十九个妇女取得同工同酬的待遇。现在，全社妇女除有病的和怀孕的外，全都卷入了生产运动。
