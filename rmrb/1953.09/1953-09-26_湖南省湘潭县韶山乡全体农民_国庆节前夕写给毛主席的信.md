    To our respected Chairman Mao:
    National Day is approaching. The farmers of your hometown would like to report to you that this year our township has had a bumper harvest of rice, with a general increase of 20% compared to last year, exceeding the production increase plan by 5%. In the first year of the great motherland's first Five-Year Plan, we have increased rice production for the motherland by more than 340,000 jin. This is our pride and honor.
    We understand that it was the Communist Party and you who personally liberated us from the feudal system. As you know, in the past, the landlords, who accounted for only 3.6% of the total households in our township, occupied 57.8% of the land. We, these toiling people, "faced the yellow earth and turned our backs to the sky," and worked hard all year round, yet we could not even get enough to eat. Now we have become the masters of the land, and everyone is striving for "patriotic production increase and prosperity through labor."
    The revolutionary seeds you personally sowed—our township's Communist Party branch—are the "locomotive" leading our production. The Communist Party members in the township personally participated in and led us to establish 43 labor mutual aid groups, set up supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives; they also led us to repair ponds and dams, eliminate pests, fight against natural disasters, and adopt various new farming techniques. Because of this, this year our township has achieved a bumper harvest with an average yield of more than 600 jin of rice per mu. Li Dejun, a poor peasant, harvested 734 jin of dried grain from his 0.72 mu of "Grade B land," which is equivalent to 1,000 jin of grain per mu. This is a miracle that the elderly people in our township are spreading. In addition, after overcoming the "five excessive burdens" in the countryside this year, the township and village cadres have also increased production, and some have even higher yields than ordinary farmers.
    Respected Chairman Mao, you are most familiar with Huangtian’ao in our township. This area has more than 60 mu of fields on the mountains. In the past, weeds on the field ridges grew more than one person tall, and the rice seedlings could not see the sun. Generally, only 400 jin of grain could be harvested per mu. But this year, the yield here is more than 590 jin per mu. Last winter and this spring, our township's Communist Party branch led us to weed three times and also transported good soil to improve the soil quality. Later, when we encountered a drought, we used waterwheels and carried water for more than ten days, and finally saved the rice seedlings.
    Chairman Mao, everyone is happy about the bumper harvest in our township. Many families have added farm tools, built new houses, and sewn new clothes. Even elderly women in their forties and fifties have bought new fountain pens to learn culture. In the past, our township relied on external grain for relief. This year, we have surplus grain to sell to the state.
    However, we also understand that every grain of food is very precious. Therefore, we are responding to the call of the Communist Party to increase production and practice economy. More than 600 households in our township raise two pigs each, and the amount of grain consumed each year is very large. This year, our township's Communist Party branch called on everyone to grow vegetables and raise pigs very early. We estimate that this year we have saved at least 50,000 jin of rice for the country.
    Respected Chairman Mao, we have many more gratifying things to tell you about our township. This year, a school that can accommodate more than 600 people has been newly built in Zhangjiashan, and our children are all enrolled. A health clinic and a health care station have been newly established in Jiajiafen Mountain, and six medical personnel are busy all day long diagnosing and treating our illnesses and delivering babies. In addition, this winter, the Hunan Provincial People's Government Water Conservancy Bureau decided to build a small reservoir in Shidong'an in our township, which can irrigate more than 3,000 mu of rice fields, not only in our township but also in the neighboring Qingxi and Ruyi townships.
    Chairman Mao, when we think about it, it seems like a dream! This is only the first year of national construction, and our township has already benefited so much. You can imagine how happy we will be in the days to come!
    On the fourth anniversary of the founding of our great People's Republic of China, we must continue to work hard to increase grain production to support national economic construction and the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. All the farmers in our township make the following four guarantees to the Communist Party and you:
    (1) All rice fields will be winter ploughed and winter planted, and grass seeds and green manure will be planted in 70% of the rice fields to lay the foundation for increasing grain production next year.
    (2) Increase the production of miscellaneous grains. After digging sweet potatoes from all dry land in the township, plant broad beans, vetches, wheat and other winter crops, apply more fertilizer, and weed diligently to ensure that the harvest of miscellaneous grains next year will increase by 15% compared with this year.
    (3) Do not steam wine or boil sugar, implement vegetable growing and pig raising, and strive to save 150,000 jin of rice for the country next year.
    (4) On the basis of 70% of the farmers in the township already being organized, conduct key rectification and consolidation this winter to steadily develop the mutual aid and cooperation movement.
    Finally, we cheer:
    Long live Chairman Mao!
    Long live the Communist Party of China!
    Long live the People's Republic of China!
        All Farmers of Shaoshan Township, Xiangtan County, Hunan Province
                        September 21st

### 湖南省湘潭县韶山乡全体农民  国庆节前夕写给毛主席的信

    湖南省湘潭县韶山乡全体农民
    国庆节前夕写给毛主席的信敬爱的毛主席：
    国庆节快到了。你的故乡的农民谨向你报告，今年我们全乡水稻丰收，普遍比去年增产两成，超过增产计划百分之五。在伟大祖国第一个五年建设计划的头一年，我们给祖国增产了三十四万多斤稻谷。这是我们的骄傲和荣誉。
    我们懂得：是共产党和你亲手把我们从封建制度下解放出来的。你是知道的，过去我们乡里只占总户数百分之三点六的地主却占去百分之五十七点八的土地。我们这些劳苦人民，“面对黄土背朝天”，一年做到头，还得不到温饱。而今我们成了土地的主人，人人争取“爱国增产、劳动发家”了。
    你亲手撒下来的革命种籽——我们乡里的共产党支部，是领导我们生产的“火车头”。全乡共产党员亲自参加和领导我们成立了四十三个劳动互助组，办起了供销合作社和信用合作社；还领导我们修塘坝、除虫，向自然灾害作斗争，采用各种新的耕作技术。就因为这样，今年我们乡里获得平均每亩田产稻六百多斤的丰收。贫农李德俊的七分二厘“乙等田”，收割了七百三十四斤干谷，折合起来，每亩有一千斤谷子。这些在我们乡里的老年人嘴边是传为奇谈的。还有，今年我们乡里克服了农村“五多”现象后，乡村干部也都增产，有的产量比一般农民还高。
    敬爱的毛主席，我们乡里的黄田坳，你是最熟悉的。这地方有六十多亩田在山岭上，往年田塍上杂草长得一人多高，禾苗见不到太阳，一般每亩只能收四百斤谷子。可是今年这里每亩有五百九十多斤的产量。去冬今春，我们乡里的共产党支部领导我们铲了三次草，还挑了好土改良了土质，后来，碰上了天旱，我们车水、挑水，坚持了上十天，终于把禾苗救活了。
    毛主席，我们乡里丰收了，大家都高兴。许多人家添农具、盖新屋、缝新衣，连四、五十岁的老年妇女也买了新钢笔学文化了。从前我们乡里是靠外面粮食接济的，今年我们有余粮卖给国家了。
    但是，我们也懂得每颗粮食都是很珍贵的。因此我们响应共产党的号召，进行增产节约。我们乡里六百多户人家，每家都养了两头猪，每年消耗的谷子很多。今年我们乡里共产党支部很早就号召大家种菜养猪，我们计算一下，今年至少给国家节约了五万斤稻谷。
    敬爱的毛主席，我们乡里还有许多可喜的事情要告诉你。今年张家山新建了一所能容六百多人的学校，我们的子弟都入学了。焦家坟山新办了卫生所和保健站，六个医务人员整天忙着给我们诊病、接生。还有，今年冬天湖南省人民政府水利局决定在我们乡里石洞庵地方修一座小型水库，能灌溉三千多亩稻田，不仅我们乡里的稻田，就是和我们相邻的清溪、如意两乡的稻田都将得到灌溉。
    毛主席，我们想起来，好像在做梦啊！这还是国家建设的头一年，我们乡里就得到这大的好处，往后的日子，你想，我们该多幸福呵！
    在我们伟大的中华人民共和国成立四周年的时候，我们一定要继续努力增产粮食，来支援国家经济建设和抗美援朝工作，我们全乡农民向共产党和你提出下面四项保证：
    （一）全部稻田冬耕冬种，在百分之七十的稻田里种草籽绿肥，为明年增产粮食打下基础。
    （二）增加杂粮生产。全乡旱土挖掉红薯后，全部种上蚕豆、麦豌、小麦等冬季作物，多施肥，勤锄草，保证明年杂粮收获量较今年增加一成半。
    （三）不蒸酒熬糖，实行种菜养猪，争取明年为国家节约十五万斤稻谷。
    （四）在全乡已有百分之七十的农民组织起来的基础上，今冬进行有重点的整顿和巩固，使互助合作运动稳步发展。
    最后我们欢呼：
    毛主席万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
        湖南省湘潭县韶山乡全体农民
                        九月二十一日
                              （新华社）
