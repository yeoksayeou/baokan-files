After watching the film "Two Worlds," technicians at the No. 5 Factory of a certain automobile repair factory in Beijing realized that it was wrong to neglect politics and purely pursue technology in the past. The North China Management Office of the China Film Distribution Corporation invited female workers, female government employees, women's federation cadres, and street activists in Beijing to hold a post-screening discussion on "Catherine's Marriage."
