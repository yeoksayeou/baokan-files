Cooperative Societies in Haicheng and Gaiping Counties, Liaodong,
Adopt Various Methods to Procure Goods and Aid Disaster Relief

In some areas of Haicheng and Gaiping counties in Liaodong Province, roads were damaged by floods, and transportation was cut off, resulting in shortages of many commodities. To ensure supplies for farmers in the disaster areas, the Dongsitai Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Haicheng County organized six cadres to carry goods from department stores in the city on their backs. Cadres from the Pailou Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative went to the city to procure goods. Because the river was swollen, carts could not pass. They adopted a method of using carts on both sides of the river and carrying goods across the river on their backs to overcome the difficulties. Xu Qingxiang, director of the Dabalingzi Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Gaiping County, led employees in the rain to buy goods in the county, purchasing 1,300 jin of sorghum rice, 180 jin of soybean oil, and autumn supplies. Some cooperative societies also used internal allocation methods to balance surpluses and shortages. In order to solve the problem of supply falling short of demand due to transportation difficulties, the Haicheng County Cooperative Federation issued a notice to all village cooperatives to try their best to solve transportation difficulties and actively organize sources of goods. First of all, they should fully satisfy the daily necessities of members, and at the same time, they should strengthen the purchase of agricultural and sideline products to help disaster areas to restore production through their own efforts.

    辽东海城盖平等县合作社
    采取各种办法办货救灾
    辽东省海城、盖平等县，部分地区道路被水冲坏，交通隔绝，造成很多商品脱销。为了保证灾区农民的供应，海城县东四台子村供销合作社组织了六名干部到城里百货公司去背货。牌楼村供销合作社的干部到城里去办货，因为大河涨水，大车过不去，他们采取了两头用车拉，过河用人背的办法，来克服困难。盖平县大巴岭子村供销合作社主任许庆祥冒雨领着职员到县里去买货，买进高粱米一千三百斤、豆油一百八十斤及秋季用品。也有的合作社用内部调拨的方法，来调剂有无。海城县合作社联合社为了解决因运输上困难而造成供不应求的局面，特通报各村社尽力设法解决运输困难，积极组织货源。首先应充分满足社员日常生活必需品，同时要加强农副产品的收购工作，以帮助灾区生产自救。
