Xinhua News Agency, September 22nd dispatch from New York: The United Nations General Assembly held a plenary meeting on the morning of September 21st to continue the general debate. Andrei Yanuarevich Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation, spoke first. Vyshinsky delivered a lengthy speech on measures to eliminate the threat of a new war and ease international tensions.

Vyshinsky put forward a draft resolution including proposals to ban atomic weapons, hydrogen bombs, and other weapons of mass destruction, and for disarmament. He also presented a draft declaration for the General Assembly, which stated that the establishment of military bases on foreign territories increased the threat of a new world war and infringed upon the sovereignty and independence of those countries. The draft declaration also condemned war propaganda.

Vyshinsky's speech attracted great attention. The venue was packed with representatives, journalists, and guests. Everyone listened attentively to the speech of the Soviet representative. When Vyshinsky, in his conclusion, called on the Eighth Session of the UN General Assembly to declare an unconditional ban on atomic weapons, hydrogen bombs, and other weapons of mass destruction, and to take measures to reduce armaments and armed forces, many representatives, journalists, and guests responded with prolonged applause.

At the meeting, Liberian representative Cooper also spoke. Speaking about the development of small countries, he pointed out that the United Nations could achieve results in this regard if the great powers did not "take advantage of the weaknesses of small countries" and if there was "no policy of strength." He said that the goal of developing weak countries could not be achieved without ending one race's "discrimination and oppression" against another.

The Liberian representative requested the UN General Assembly to consider the demands of oppressed nations, especially the demands of the African people. He said, "The national aspirations of the Asian people are awakening, and the shackles of slavery there have been broken… The tide demanding independence is spreading to every continent. This movement cannot be stopped, and it will sweep away all obstacles in its path." The Liberian representative then said: We believe that the United Nations must "listen to the voices of our African brothers." However, the Liberian representative also repeated the cliché of the so-called "iron curtain" propagated by the United States.

The President of the United Nations General Assembly, Indian representative Mrs. Pandit, announced that the General Committee would convene a meeting on September 22nd to review the issue of including the "Secretary-General's Memorandum on the Implementation of Resolution 3 adopted by the General Assembly on August 28, 1953" on the agenda of the General Assembly. The aforementioned Resolution 3 relates to the replies submitted by the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the issue of the Korean Political Conference.

Xinhua News Agency, September 22nd dispatch from Moscow: The Soviet delegation submitted a draft resolution on "Measures to Eliminate the Threat of Another World War and Ease International Tensions" at the plenary meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on September 21st. The full text is as follows:

"The General Assembly considers that the cessation of hostilities in Korea is a significant step towards easing international tensions and creates favorable conditions for implementing further measures to prevent the threat of another world war.

The General Assembly also declares that in some countries, the arms race is not only not diminishing, but is continuing on a larger scale; due to the latest achievements in the application of atomic energy in this regard, weapons of mass destruction are even more harmful and frightening to millions of people.

In order to alleviate the threat of another major war and strengthen peace and the security of all peoples:

1.  The General Assembly declares an unconditional ban on atomic weapons, hydrogen bombs, and other weapons of mass destruction, and instructs the Security Council to take urgent measures to draft and implement an international agreement to ensure the establishment of strict international control to supervise the implementation of this ban.

2.  The General Assembly recommends that the five permanent members of the Security Council—the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France, and China, which bear primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security—reduce their armed forces by one-third within one year. In order to alleviate the burden of military expenditures, the General Assembly recommends that the Security Council convene an international conference on disarmament as soon as possible to ensure that all countries reduce their armaments.

3.  The General Assembly believes that the establishment of land, air, and naval bases on foreign territories increases the threat of another world war and infringes upon the sovereignty and independence of these countries.

The General Assembly recommends that the Security Council take steps to abolish military bases established on foreign territories. The General Assembly considers this an important measure to ensure lasting peace and international security.

4.  The General Assembly condemns the propaganda being carried out in some countries that aims to incite hostility and hatred among peoples and advocates a new war, and demands that all countries take measures to stop such propaganda, which is incompatible with the main principles and purposes of the United Nations."

    苏联代表团建议联合国大会采取措施
    消除战争威胁缓和国际紧张局势
    维辛斯基演说呼吁禁用原子武器裁减军备
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会于九月二十一日上午举行全体会议，继续一般辩论。苏联代表团团长安·扬·维辛斯基首先发言。维辛斯基就消除新战争威胁和缓和国际紧张局势的措施发表了长篇的演说。
    维辛斯基提出了一项决议草案，其中包括禁止原子武器、氢弹与其他大规模杀人武器及裁减军备的建议。他并提出了一份大会的宣言草案，草案中指出，在外国领土上建立军事基地的行动增加了新世界大战的威胁，并侵犯了这些国家的主权和独立。宣言草案也谴责战争宣传。
    维辛斯基的演说受到大家极大的注意。会场中挤满了代表、新闻记者和来宾。大家聚精会神地倾听苏联代表的发言。当维辛斯基在结语中呼吁联合国第八届大会宣布无条件禁止原子武器、氢弹和其他大规模杀人武器并采取措施裁减军备与武装部队的时候，许多代表、新闻记者和来宾都报以经久不息的掌声。
    在这次会议上利比里亚代表库柏也发了言。他谈到小国的发展问题时指出，如果大国不“利用小国的弱点”，如果“没有实力政策”，联合国在这方面就能获得成效。他说，不终止一个种族对另一个种族的“歧视和压迫”，发展弱小国家这一目的就不可能达到。
    利比里亚代表要求联合国大会考虑被压迫民族的要求，首先是非洲人民的要求，他说：“亚洲人民的民族愿望正在觉醒，那里的奴役枷锁已经被打断了。……要求独立的浪潮正扩展到每一个大陆。这一运动是阻挡不了的，它将扫除它道路上的一切障碍。”利比里亚代表接着说：我们认为联合国必须
  “听听我们非洲同胞们的话”。然而，利比里亚代表也重复了美国宣传所谓“铁幕”的滥调。
    联合国大会主席印度代表潘迪特夫人宣布：总务委员会将于九月二十二日召开会议，以审议苏联代表团提出的把“秘书长关于一九五三年八月二十八日大会通过的第三项决议案的执行情况的备忘录”这一项列入大会议程的问题。上述第三项决议案是与中华人民共和国中央人民政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府就朝鲜政治会议问题提出的答复有关的。
    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十二日讯：苏联代表团在九月二十一日联合国大会全体会议上提出了“关于消除另一次世界大战的威胁和缓和国际紧张局势的措施”的决议草案。全文如下：
    “大会认为：朝鲜境内敌对行动的终止是导向国际紧张局势缓和的重大步骤，并为实施防止另一次世界大战威胁的进一步的措施创造了有利的条件。
    大会同时宣告：在若干国家内，扩张军备的竞赛不但没有减退，而且以更大的规模继续进行；由于原子能应用在这方面的最新成果，大规模杀人武器对于千百万人民是更有害和更可怕了。
    为了减轻另一次大战的威胁，加强和平和各国人民的安全：
    一、大会宣布无条件禁止原子武器、氢弹和其他大规模毁灭性武器，并责成安全理事会采取紧急的措施，来草拟和实施一项保证建立严格的国际管制以监督这一禁令的执行的国际协议。
    二、大会建议对维持国际和平和安全负有主要责任的安全理事会五个常任理事国——美国、苏联、英国、法国和中国——在一年之内把武装部队裁减三分之一。为了减轻军事费用的负担，大会建议安全理事会尽早召开保证各国裁减军备的国际会议。
    三、大会认为在外国领土上建立陆、空、海军基地的行动，增加了另一次世界大战的威胁，并侵犯了这些国家的主权和独立。
    大会建议安全理事会采取步骤，取消在外国领土上建立的军事基地。大会认为这是保证持久和平和国际安全的重要措施。
    四、大会谴责正在若干国家内进行的、旨在煽动各国人民间敌对和仇视情绪并拥护新战争的宣传，并要求一切国家采取措施来制止这种与联合国的主要原则和宗旨不相符合的宣传。”
