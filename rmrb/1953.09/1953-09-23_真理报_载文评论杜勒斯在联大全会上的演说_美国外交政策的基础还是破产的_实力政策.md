Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 20th: "Truth Daily" published an article by Yuri Zhukov entitled "Old Conspiracy in New Clothes." In the article, Zhukov commented on Dulles' speech to the United Nations General Assembly on September 17th. Zhukov pointed out that the American propaganda machine boasted that this speech was a "new masterpiece" in American foreign policy. The semi-official commentaries on the speech in Washington, London, and Paris all emphasized as much as possible that it was a speech with a "conciliatory nature."

If this statement were indeed true, then the U.S. Secretary of State's speech would certainly be welcome. If the United States were to end the "Cold War," it would certainly improve the international atmosphere. However, even a most careful study of Dulles' speech does not reveal the slightest intention on the part of the U.S. government to take such a step. What matters is not how the U.S. Secretary of State says things, or how he phrases them, but what he says.

Dulles mentioned many problems that need to be resolved, including the issues of Korea, Germany and Austria, Indochina, and disarmament. Although he declared at the beginning of his speech that the United States did "not monopolize all wisdom and virtue," he always spoke as if wisdom and virtue were on the side of the United States in any matter, and an agreement could be reached as long as the other party obeyed the decisions of the United States.

The U.S. Secretary of State's speech leaves no doubt that the foundation of the foreign policy pursued by those who rule the United States remains unchanged – this foundation remains those things that have failed in practice: "tough policy" and "policy of strength."

Zhukov continued by saying that everyone who is unwilling to close his eyes to the life around him can clearly see that this policy, which ignores the actual balance of power on the international stage and ignores the historical changes that have taken place since the end of World War II, has gone bankrupt. This explains why the resistance to Washington's enforced adventurous policies is becoming more and more intense in the camp of U.S. allies. This also explains why, this August, when the United States intended to turn the political conference discussing the Korean issue into a "second Panmunjom" and shut out neutral Asian countries, it suffered a moral and political defeat.

Dulles' entire speech shows that the U.S. ruling clique has in fact no intention of slightly changing its original attitude to prove that they are truly willing to play a substantial role in the peaceful resolution of disputes; they believe that, in this regard, all work must be completed by the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries through unilateral concessions.

Zhukov pointed out that part of Dulles' speech specifically discussed plans to revise the United Nations Charter in smooth terms. It is no accident that the American diplomatic authorities have more frequently and more stubbornly raised the issue of revising the United Nations Charter at a time when the people of the world are firmly demanding the easing of international tensions. Dulles' statement that the U.S. Senate is extremely interested in revising the United Nations Charter inadvertently revealed the hidden plans of those who advocate revising the United Nations Charter. The fundamental reason for the existence of the United Nations is that it is an international organization, not an agency serving a certain country. Dulles has revealed the cards of those who are playing tricks, whose main purpose is to ultimately turn the United Nations into an affiliated agency of the U.S. State Department.

Zhukov said that, judging from all these facts, the words that the U.S. ruling clique really wants to work hard to ease international tensions or is really willing to explore ways to eliminate the current tensions are nothing more than meaningless clamoring. The new clothes cannot help Mr. Dulles conceal his old conspiracy. The people of all countries are eagerly awaiting a solution to international disputes.

Zhukov concluded that the way to actually solve international problems is clear and feasible. This is the way for the parties concerned to reach a common agreement, and this is the way for one party not to issue orders to the other party and stipulate preconditions.

    “真理报”载文评论杜勒斯在联大全会上的演说
    美国外交政策的基础还是破产的“实力政策”
    【新华社二十一日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十日讯：“真理报”发表了尤里·茹科夫的文章，题为“披着新外衣的旧阴谋”。茹科夫在文章里评论了杜勒斯九月十七日在联合国大会全体会议上的演说。茹科夫指出：美国的宣传机器吹嘘说，这篇演说是美国外交政策上的“新杰作”。华盛顿、伦敦和巴黎对这篇演说的半官方评论都尽可能地强调说，这是具有一种“和解性质”的演说。
    假如这种说法的确是真实的话，那么美国国务卿的演说当然是值得欢迎的。美国如果终止“冷战”，当然只会使国际气氛更为好转。可是，即使对杜勒斯的演说作最仔细的研究，也看不出美国政府有一点意思准备采取这样一种步骤。重要的不是美国国务卿如何说法，如何措辞，而是他说了些什么。
    杜勒斯提到了许多有待解决的问题，包括朝鲜、德国和奥地利问题，印度支那问题，裁减军备问题等。虽然他在演说一开始的时候就宣布美国并“没有垄断一切智慧和美德”，可是他时时刻刻总把事情说得好像在任何问题上智慧和美德都是在美国这方面，只要另外一方服从美国的决定就可达成协议。
    美国国务卿的演说使人对这一点丝毫不用怀疑，即统治美国的人所奉行的外交政策的基础仍然没有改变——这个基础仍然是那些在实践中已经失败的东西：“强硬方针”“实力政策”。
    茹科夫接着说，每一个不愿意对他周围的生活闭起眼睛来的人都能明显地看出：这个无视国际舞台上实际力量对比、无视第二次世界大战结束以来所发生的历史变化的政策，已经破产了。这就说明了：为什么在美国盟友的阵营中对华盛顿所强制执行的冒险政策的反抗越来越激烈。这也说明了：为什么今年八月美国在打算将讨论朝鲜问题的政治会议变成“第二个板门店”，将亚洲中立国家摒于门外的时候，遭到了道义上和政治上的失败。
    杜勒斯的整篇演说说明：美国统治集团实际上并无意稍稍改变原来的态度，以证明他们真正愿意在和平解决争执中发挥相当的作用；他们认为，在这方面，一切工作都要由苏联以及各人民民主国家以片面让步的方法去完成。
    茹科夫指出，杜勒斯演说的一部分以圆滑的词句专门谈到修改联合国宪章的计划。正当世界各国人民坚决要求缓和国际紧张局势的时候，美国外交当局更频繁地、更顽固地提出了修改联合国宪章问题，这不是偶然的。杜勒斯说美国参议院对修改联合国宪章极感兴趣，这句话无意中泄露了主张修改联合国宪章的人们的隐秘计划。联合国之所以存在的根本理由在于它是一个国际组织，不是一个为某一个国家服务的机构。杜勒斯揭开了那些耍骗局的人们的牌，他们的主要目的是要把联合国最后变成美国国务院的一个附属机构。
    茹科夫说，从所有这些事实来看，那些说美国统治集团真要努力缓和国际紧张局势或真愿意探求消除目前紧张局势的道路的话，不过是一种毫无意义的叫嚷罢了。新的外衣并不能帮助杜勒斯先生掩饰他的旧阴谋。各国人民正殷切地等待国际争执得到解决。
    茹科夫结语说，实际解决国际问题的道路是明晰而可行的。这就是有关方面取得共同协议的道路，这就是一方不得向另一方发号施令并规定先决条件的道路。
