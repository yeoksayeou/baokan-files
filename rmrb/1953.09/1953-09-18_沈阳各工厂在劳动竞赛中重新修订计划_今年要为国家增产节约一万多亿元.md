Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, September 17th: To ensure the comprehensive and over-fulfillment of the national plan, state-owned and local state-owned factories in Shenyang City have revised their annual production increase and savings plans during the recent labor competition. Preliminary statistics show that 95 state-owned and local state-owned factories in the city are striving to increase production and savings for the country by a total of 10.07 trillion yuan, on top of completing their annual national plans. This includes an increase in total production value of 7.7 trillion yuan and total savings of 3 trillion yuan.

    On the basis of completing the national plan for the first half of the year, the broad masses of workers in Shenyang factories began a labor competition in August. Recently, all factories have universally inspected and analyzed the implementation of the national plan and revised their annual production increase and savings plans according to the actual conditions of their units. The Shenyang Smelter originally set a target of completing a production increase and savings value of 50 billion yuan for the whole year. However, after a specific inspection of each workshop, it found the key to tapping production potential and therefore decided to increase production and savings for the country by another 19.9 billion yuan on the basis of the original plan. After in-depth inspection, the metalworking workshop of the Shenyang Transformer Factory determined that by strengthening the quality responsibility system and inspection system, it could guarantee an increase in the production of 136 large and small transformers, creating 50 billion yuan of wealth for the country. After discovering various favorable conditions in production, the Shenyang Water Pump Factory plans to increase the total value of goods by 14.6 percent over the national plan, the total value of production by 21.5 percent over the national plan, labor productivity by 20.7 percent over the national plan, and reduce costs by 11.31 percent compared with the national plan. After the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Plant promoted the advanced experience of high-speed drilling, it increased efficiency by more than seven times, solving the key problem affecting the imbalance of production in the entire plant. The workers plan to increase the production of ten lathes in September as a gift to the National Day. The city's 36 local state-owned factories also plan to increase production and savings for the country by 78 billion yuan by the end of the year.

    The revised production increase and savings plans of the Shenyang factories are based on strengthening plan management and technical management. Workers in all factory workshops are focusing on solving key production problems, proposing various effective technical measures, and formulating specific methods to ensure the completion of the plan.

    沈阳市各工厂的广大职工，在完成上半年国家计划的基础上，八月份开始开展了劳动竞赛。最近，各厂又普遍检查和分析了执行国家计划的情况，并根据本单位的实际情况，修订了全年的增产节约计划。沈阳冶炼厂原来确定全年完成增产节约价值五百亿元，最近经过对各车间的具体检查，找到了发掘生产潜力的关键，因此确定在原计划增产的基础上，再为国家增产节约一百九十九亿元。沈阳变压器厂金工车间经过深入检查，确定通过加强质量责任制和检查制度，保证增产大小变压器一百三十六台，为国家增产五百亿元的财富。沈阳水泵厂在发掘出生产中的各种有利条件以后，计划要求全年商品总值超过国家计划百分之十四点六；生产总值超过国家计划百分之二十一点五；劳动生产率超过国家计划百分之二十点七；成本较国家计划降低百分之十一点三一。沈阳机床三厂推广高速钻空法的先进经验以后，提高效率七倍多，解决了影响全厂生产不平衡的关键问题。职工们计划在九月份增产十台车床，作为向国庆节的献礼。全市三十六个地方国营工厂，也计划到年底为国家增产节约七百八十亿元。
    沈阳市各工厂重新修订的增产节约计划，是在加强计划管理和技术管理的基础上进行的。各工厂车间的工人，都围绕着解决生产上的关键问题，提出各种有效的技术措施，并制订出保证完成计划的具体办法。
