    Supplying Consumers with Seasonally Appropriate Goods

    Early Transport of Cotton Cloth to Supply Remote Areas
    The Xi'an Purchasing and Supply Station of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company is transporting cotton cloth early to meet market demand. In order to adapt to the transportation conditions in remote minority areas in the Northwest, the station began preparing for the peak season supply as early as the second quarter of this year, with some goods already transported in advance. Of the cotton cloth dispatched by the station to wholesale stores in Shaanxi Province in August, 75% was shipped in advance in July; all cotton cloth dispatched in September was also shipped out in August. The cotton cloth supplied to Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, and Xinjiang in August can also be guaranteed to complete the task on time.
    The Xi'an Purchasing and Supply Station of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company has now transferred cadres from the Shaanxi Provincial Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, the Xi'an Warehouse Company, and other units to strengthen transportation work, and is actively studying ways to simplify procedures, improve commodity allocation systems, and reduce transit times to ensure timely supply to meet market needs.

    Department Store Adds "Trading Room"
    To facilitate the bulk purchase of cloth by various units, the Handan Branch of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company has added a trading room in its department store. It displays new samples and assigns dedicated personnel to be responsible for reception and negotiation. In addition to cash and carry transactions, the trading room particularly focuses on developing contract business with local department stores, cooperatives, private cotton cloth businesses, and collective consumers; as long as the demanding units draw up a variety plan in advance and sign a supply contract with the company, timely supply is guaranteed. In addition, the company has also designated special personnel to assist units coming from afar to purchase goods, organizing packaging and contacting relevant transportation departments to handle transportation matters.

    Pay Attention to Investigating Production and Sales
    State-owned department stores and purchasing and supply stations in the Southwest region have paid special attention to investigating production and sales when organizing peak season supplies, and have successively held business meetings and supply meetings to prepare materials for the peak season to understand the needs of urban and rural people. In early August, the Chongqing Department Store Purchasing and Supply Station convened a meeting of representatives of towel and sock salespersons from state-owned stores within its supply range to study production and sales, and expanded its purchase and sales plan. Many state-owned department stores and purchasing and supply stations also held internal inventory exchange meetings and organized salesmen to visit production departments to facilitate face-to-face interaction between production and sales, so as to exchange opinions and improve product quality.

    Large Quantities of Goods Transported to the Shores of Dongting Lake
    Large quantities of cloth, daily necessities, and other goods have been continuously transported from various places to the primary markets along the shores of Dongting Lake to supply farmers. Ships loaded with these goods shuttle incessantly between the river ports along the shores of Dongting Lake. Hundreds of ships enter and leave the three major ports of Dongting Lake—Changde, Yiyang, and Jinshi—every day. The volume of goods imported into Changde Port in the first half of August increased by 30% compared with the same period last year. According to incomplete statistics from the cooperatives of eight counties along the lake—Changde, Nanxian, Yuanjiang, Hanshou, Lixian, Anxiang, Huarong, and Yiyang—the average daily transfer of goods in the first half of August was worth approximately 1 billion yuan, including several thousand bolts of various cloths. The Nanxian, Changde, and Jinshi stores of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company transported more than 70,000 bolts of various cloths in the first half of August.

    Prepare High-Quality Clothing Materials to Meet Needs
    As the weather is getting colder, the Tianjin Department Store and the Municipal Cooperative Department Store are preparing large quantities of high-quality clothing materials for the market. The first batch of Tianjin-produced fancy serge began to be sold in early August and was very popular with customers. In their procurement plans, various units paid special attention to high-quality clothing materials. The Tianjin Department Store has prepared a large quantity of woolen fabrics, wool serge, and various leather materials. The Department Store has also prepared a particularly large number of single cotton uniforms, cotton quilts, cotton jackets, and cotton shoes this year, with the procurement plan for various uniforms increasing threefold compared to last year; Polish flannel serge was selected for quilt covers, and a large number of cotton quilts were made; in the purchase of caps, in addition to fabrics such as gabardine and paramount, a large number of woolen fabrics were also prepared; the styles of woolen underwear increased from three last year to six.

    Design New Varieties and Patterns
    The Zhejiang Provincial Company of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company and the Zhejiang Provincial Company of the China National Department Store have respectively established technical design teams to design new varieties and patterns based on consumer feedback. In the past, the towels produced in Hangzhou were only available in plain white and colored stripes, which were not very popular with consumers. After adding new varieties such as checks, fine stripes, and prints in July, the products of various towel factories were quickly sold out. Factories producing cotton cloth, silk fabrics, socks, and cotton sweaters have also created many new varieties and patterns under the guidance of state-owned commercial departments.

    Silk Fabrics Also Sold to Rural Areas
    The Jiangsu Provincial Branch of the China National Silk Company plans to increase silk production by 140.6% of the output in 1951 this year. The sales volume of silk fabrics has been increasing month by month since February. Silk fabrics are not only sold in various cities but also in rural areas. The real silk, Parisian satin, brocade satin, and other quilt covers and checked spun silk, crepe de chine, and other products produced this year are very popular with consumers. To better meet the different needs of consumers, the China National Silk Company has designed a variety of new products, actively improved silk weaving specifications, and improved the quality of silk fabrics. More than 260 kinds of brightly colored and intricately patterned silk fabrics such as woolen serge, four-dimensional serge, brocade satin, and Parisian satin have been prepared.

    No Longer a "Goods-Shortage Company"
    The state-owned commercial system in the Northwest region is increasing the variety of goods to welcome the peak season. The Xi'an Department Store Wholesale and Supply Station added more than 900 kinds of goods from June to July, almost doubling the original number of goods. The Xi'an Trade Company added 287 kinds of general merchandise, 32 kinds of local products, and 150 kinds of food in July. The Xi'an Department Store added more than 60 kinds of fabrics and more than 60 kinds of autumn goods. These included various bath towels, soft satins, crepe satins, wool yarn, autumn clothing, and autumn pants produced in Shanghai, many of which had never been sold before. The Jiefang Road Department Store in Xi'an added thirteen kinds of goods in the third quarter, including children's clothing, children's toys, leather shoes, pillow cores, cotton blankets, wool blankets, and valuable Enicar, Oris, and Roga men's and women's watches. The sales revenue on August 20 was nearly double the sales revenue on July 20. The impression among the masses that "department stores are goods-shortage companies" has now been generally reversed.

    Winter Clothing Delivered to Yichun Forest Area
    In mid-August, according to the contract, the Yichun Department Store in the forest area delivered more than 20,000 sets of cotton clothing to the local Forestry Industry Bureau. At the same time, batches of cotton galoshes and leather hats have also been transported to the area successively, and the vast number of loggers have purchased winter clothing in advance.
    The Yichun Department Store began preparing for the supply of winter clothing as early as the second quarter. With the help of the local Party committee, they specially formed a working group to go to the operation sites in the forest area to understand the needs of the workers. As a result, they mastered the different requirements of workers engaged in lifting timber, logging, loading vehicles, and sawing. For example, workers lifting timber requested to wear riding breeches, which are convenient for walking and not easy to trip over; logging workers often climb mountains and hills, and generally requested to wear casual clothes. To ensure a more accurate supply, they also actively investigated the required numbers with the Forestry Industry Bureau and signed a supply contract. Therefore, the various winter goods they purchased and processed not only met the requirements of the workers but also ensured accuracy and timeliness.

    Shenyang Grain Company Prepares to Supply Holiday Goods
    The Shenyang Grain Company has fully prepared the staple foods needed by citizens during the National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival and decided to start supplying them from September 15th.
    They started preparing for the holiday supply as early as two months ago. Based on the reality that people's purchasing power is constantly increasing, the Grain Company plans to supply one and a half to two times more Northeast rice and high-quality white flour and soybean oil than during the Dragon Boat Festival. All goods have now been basically prepared. They decided to allocate 70% of the holiday goods to various supply and marketing cooperatives throughout the city to supply to citizens; the remaining 30% will be directly sold by the company's stores.

    把适应季节的商品供给消费者
    提早调运棉布供应边远地区
    中国花纱布公司西安采购供应站提早调运棉布应市。为了适应西北边远少数民族地区运输条件，该站早在今年第二季度，就开始准备旺季物资的供应工作，其中部分已提前调运。该站八月份调往陕西省各批发商店的棉布，有百分之七十五已在七月份提前运出；九月份调运的棉布也在八月份全部运出。八月份供应甘肃、青海、宁夏、新疆四省的棉布，也能保证按时完成任务。
    中国花纱布公司西安采购供应站，现已抽调了陕西省花纱布公司、西安市仓库公司等单位的干部，加强调运工作，并积极研究简化手续，改进商品调拨制度、减少转运时间，以保证及时供应市场需要。

    门市部添设“交易室”
    中国花纱布公司邯郸分公司为便利各单位大批选购布匹，特在门市部添设交易室。陈列新颖样品，派专人负责招待、接谈。在交易室里除成交现款、现货业务外，特着重对各地百货公司、合作社、私营棉布业和集体消费者开展合同业务；各需货单位只要事先编造品种计划，和该公司签订了供应合同，就保证按时供应。另外该公司还指定了专人协助各地远道来采购的单位整理包装和联系有关运输部门办理运输事务等。（韩角今）
    注意调查产销情况
    西南区各省、市国营百货公司及采购供应站，在组织旺季货源时，特别注意了调查产销情况，曾先后召开了为旺季准备物资的业务会议和供应会议，了解城乡人民的需要。重庆百货采购供应站在八月初召开了供应范围内各国营商店的毛巾、袜子营业员代表会议，研究生产、销售情况，扩大了购销计划。许多国营百货公司及采购供应站，还举行了内部库存物资交流会，和组织推销员参观生产部门，使产、销见面，以便交换意见，提高产品质量。
    大批物资运到了洞庭湖滨
    大批布匹、日用百货等物资已源源从各地运到洞庭湖滨各初级市场供应农民。装载这些物资的船只，川流不息地来往于洞庭湖滨各河港间。洞庭湖滨的三个主要港口—常德、益阳和津市，每天有数百艘船只出进。常德港口八月上、中旬进口的物资较去年同期增加百分之三十。据滨湖的常德、南县、沅江、汉寿、澧县、安乡、华容和益阳等八个县合作社的不完全统计，八月上半月平均每天要调进约值十亿元的物资，其中各种布每天要运到数千匹。中国花纱布公司南县、常德、津市三个商店在八月上、中旬就运进各种布七万多匹。
    准备质量好的衣料供应需要
    天气渐凉了，天津市百货公司门市部及市合作社门市部正准备大批质量较高的服装料应市。首批天津产花哔叽已于八月初开始登市，很受顾客欢迎。各单位在进货计划中，特别注意质量较高的服装料。天津市百货公司门市部已备妥了大批呢绒和毛哔叽及各种皮料子。该公司门市部今年准备的单棉制服、棉被、棉甲克、棉鞋也特别多，各种制服的进货计划比去年增加三倍；并选用波兰花绒哔叽做被面，做了大批棉被；在采购的制帽中，除了华达呢、派拉蒙等料子外，还准备大批呢料子的；绒衣的式样由去年的三种增加到六种。
    设计新的品种和花色
    中国花纱布公司浙江省公司和中国百货公司浙江省公司分别设立了技术设计小组，根据消费者的意见，设计新的品种和花色。杭州过去出产的毛巾，只有全白的和彩条两种，很不受消费者欢迎。七月份增加了方格、细条和印花等新品种后，各毛巾厂的产品，很快就销售出去了。棉布、绸缎、袜子、棉毛衫等工厂，也在国营商业部门指导下创造了很多新的品种和花样。
    丝织品也销到了农村
    中国蚕丝公司江苏省分公司，今年计划增加的绸产量为一九五一年的百分之一百四十点六。丝织品的销售量，自二月份起逐月增加，丝织品不仅在各城市行销，而且也销到了农村。今年生产的真丝、巴黎缎、织锦缎等被面和格子纺绸、碧绉等，很受消费者欢迎。为了更好地满足消费者不同的需要，中国蚕丝公司设计了多种新制品，积极改进丝织规格，提高丝织品的质量。已准备好的有纺建呢、四维呢、织锦缎和巴黎缎等二百六十多种色彩鲜丽、花色繁多的丝织品。
    不再是“缺货公司”了
    西北区国营商业系统，增加商品品种，迎接旺季。西安百货批发供应站，自六月到七月增添了九百多种商品，几乎比原来的商品增添了一倍。西安市贸易公司七月份增添了百货二百八十七种、土产三十二种、食品一百五十种。西安市百货商店增添了各色布匹六十余种，和秋季商品六十多种。有上海出产的各种浴巾、各色软缎、克利缎、毛线、秋衣、秋裤等，其中有许多货物都是过去没有经营过的。西安市解放路百货门市部，第三季度新添了童装、小孩玩具、皮鞋、枕头心、棉毯、毛毯及贵重的英纳格、奥奇都、路茄等男女手表十三种商品。八月二十日卖钱额比七月二十日的卖钱额增加将近一倍。现在一般已扭转了群众认为“百货公司是缺货公司”的印象了。  （陈瑞良）
    冬装已送到了伊春林区
    八月中旬，按照合同的规定，林区伊春百货公司已把第一批棉服两万多套交给了当地的森林工业局。同时，成批的棉胶鞋和皮帽子也已陆续运到，广大的伐木工人提前买到了冬装。
    伊春百货公司早在第二季度就着手进行冬装供应的准备工作。他们在当地党委的帮助下，专门组成了工作组前往林区的作业所了解工人需要。由此，掌握了抬木、采伐、装车、拉锯工人的不同要求。比如抬木工人要求穿马裤，走路方便，不易绊倒；采伐工人经常上山爬岭，普遍要求穿便服。为了供应得更准确，他们并主动地和森林工业局调查了需要数字，签订了供应合同。因此，他们采购和加工出来各种冬货不但适合工人的要求，也作到了准确、及时。
    沈阳市粮食公司准备供应节货
    沈阳市粮食公司把市民在国庆节和中秋节需要的主食品已经准备齐全，决定从九月十五日起开始供应。
    早在两个月以前他们就开始了节日供应的准备工作。根据人民购买力不断提高的现实情况，粮食公司计划供应东北大米和上等白面、豆油的数量比端午节多出一倍半到两倍。现在各货已基本准备齐全。他们决定把百分之七十的节货拨给全市各个供销合作社向市民供应；余下的百分之三十由公司门市部直接销售。
