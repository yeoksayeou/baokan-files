The US-British Wheat Struggle
Shi Chi

The struggle between the United States and Britain in the capitalist world wheat market reflects the further sharpening of contradictions between the two countries and signifies that the US policy of monopolizing the capitalist world market is facing increasingly strong resistance. Recently, in the wheat struggle, the United States, which has dominated the capitalist world market for many years, stumbled for the first time in front of Britain.

This spring, the signatory countries of the 1949 "International Wheat Agreement" (including four exporting countries, namely the United States, Canada, Australia, and France, and forty-two importing countries, namely the United Kingdom, West Germany, and India), held an "International Wheat Conference" in Washington to discuss the revision of a new agreement, as the old agreement was to expire at the end of July. The old agreement stipulated: the maximum price of wheat was US$1.80 per bushel (approximately 54.5 Chinese jin), and the minimum price was US$1.50 (if the price of wheat fell, it could be reduced by ten cents each year until US$1.20); in addition to trading according to the agreed quotas and prices, importing and exporting countries could buy and sell "non-agreement wheat" in the free market, and the price and quantity were not restricted. At the time of signing the old agreement, the wheat market tended to fall due to oversupply, but in order to guarantee the profits of its own grain monopoly capitalists, the United States did not hesitate to adopt national subsidy policies to protect the export of "agreement wheat" in order to maintain the high price of US "non-agreement wheat," which remained at more than US$2.20 per bushel, once reaching US$2.60 in 1951; as a result, "agreement wheat" always maintained the maximum price of US$1.80. At the Washington conference, the United States, as the largest exporter of wheat, demanded that the price of the new agreement be raised to US$2.50 based on the artificially high US wheat market price; however, the importing countries, led by the United Kingdom, firmly opposed this asking price, and other exporting countries did not express support. After more than two months of haggling, the "International Wheat Agreement" was finally extended for three years in April, stipulating US$2.05 per bushel; however, the United Kingdom still refused to participate in the new agreement because the price it insisted on was US$2.00 per bushel.

The United Kingdom is the largest importer of wheat, purchasing more than 177 million bushels annually according to the new agreement, accounting for about one-third of the total import quota. Therefore, the United Kingdom's refusal to participate in the new agreement cannot but weaken the role of the agreement and hit the US monopoly capital's plan to control the world wheat market. The recent decline in the US grain market is closely related to the US-British wheat struggle.

Why does the United States want to manipulate the "International Wheat Agreement"? This can be understood from the aspects of wheat stagnation and surplus in the United States and the profits of US grain monopoly capitalists. According to the agreement, the quantity and price of wheat imported or exported by each participating country are stipulated. Therefore, the United States, as the largest exporting country, can rely on the agreement to dump its surplus wheat at high prices. The US Department of Agriculture has openly admitted: "This agreement guarantees us a market that has never been seen before... Without this agreement, it would be difficult to sell our wheat in many foreign markets." At the same time, "this agreement gives our private merchants the opportunity to compete in foreign markets, which they would not be able to compete without an agreement like this." That is to say, the "International Wheat Agreement" not only guarantees the United States to export more than 270 million bushels of "agreement wheat" annually, but also will have an impact on the free market, enabling the United States to sell a large amount of "non-agreement wheat."

The situation of wheat stagnation and surplus in the United States is very serious, and this situation has deepened the US agricultural crisis. US Senator Bridges admitted that US agricultural products have created an "unmanageable surplus." Some American newspapers even anticipate the re-enactment of the 1920s and 1930s. During these two periods of great economic panic in the United States, a large amount of US wheat and other grains were poured into the sea because they could not be sold. In the 1951-1952 fiscal year, due to the poor harvest in Argentina (which did not participate in the "International Wheat Agreement"), the output of Australian wheat was reduced due to the reduction of planting area, and due to the increase in the strategic storage quantity of wheat in Western European countries, and the food-deficient countries in Asia and Latin America also absorbed a lot of American wheat, the export volume of American wheat and flour once surged, reaching about 460 million bushels, almost double that of the previous year. But the good times did not last long. In the 1952-1953 fiscal year, it decreased by 30 percent to only 320 million bushels. The accumulated wheat inventory in the United States was more than 250 million bushels as of July 1 last year, but according to the estimate in August this year, it has increased to more than 700 million bushels. At present, there is no warehouse to hold the excess wheat in the United States, so that the New York "Commercial Daily" screamed wildly that "the only hope for the United States is drought" in order to solve these mountains of wheat inventory.

The reason for the stagnation and surplus of wheat in the United States is inseparable from the economic militarization of capitalist countries. As Comrade Malenkov said in his report to the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union: "The militarization of the economy makes these countries use tax increases to squeeze money from the people. All this turns the budgets of capitalist countries into a means for billionaires to plunder the people, greatly reduces the purchasing power of the people, and reduces the demand for industrial and agricultural products." As a result of the stepped-up arms expansion and war preparation in capitalist countries, inflation, soaring prices, increased taxes, and reduced real wages have generally been caused, and the working people have been further impoverished and have fallen into unemployment and semi-unemployment in large numbers, and thus have had to reduce the consumption of wheat, flour and other grains. In Western Europe, horse feed has become the main food for workers. At the same time, due to the intensification of exports by the United States and restrictions on imports, the difficulties of the "dollar shortage" in other capitalist countries have been deepened. These countries have had to reduce the import of US wheat and import wheat that does not pay in US dollars in order to reduce the consumption of foreign exchange reserves.

On the other hand, the domestic consumption of wheat in the United States is also decreasing. In 1952, each American consumed an average of less than 130 pounds of flour, 14.7 percent less than in 1946. This is not only due to the shrinking purchasing power of the American people, but also because the price of grain is too expensive. In 1952, the retail price of bread in the United States rose by 28 percent compared with 1947. Therefore, many Americans are starving, even if US officials admit that one-fifth of American families cannot get enough to eat, although a large amount of wheat is piled up and rotting in warehouses.

Despite the serious stagnation and surplus of wheat in the United States, US grain monopoly capitalists still maintain high prices in order to ensure their high profits. They increase the burden on taxpayers through the US government and use national subsidies to offset the difference between the price of "agreement wheat" and the domestic price, thereby raising the level of domestic prices. According to the statistics of the "New York Herald Tribune," in the 1952-1953 fiscal year, the US grain monopoly capital received subsidies of 188 million US dollars, and since August 1949, that is, in the four years of the implementation of the "International Wheat Agreement," a total of 600 million US dollars has been obtained. It should be pointed out that this subsidy is of little benefit to ordinary US farmers. As mentioned above, the retail price of bread in the United States rose by 28 percent from 1947 to 1952, but the price of wheat fell by 30 percent during the same period. Most of the grains sold by farmers did not reach the government-supported price, but flowed into the free market. For example, in June of this year, the government-supported price of wheat was US$2.10 per bushel, but the average price sold by farmers was only US$1.88, and the lowest was even less than US$1.50. According to the materials at the end of 1952, the farmer's share of every dollar of grain purchased by American consumers was only 16 cents, and the remaining 84 cents mainly fell into the pockets of American grain capitalists. Therefore, it is not difficult to understand that this absurd subsidy system is of course opposed by the American people. The reason why the US representative stalemated with the United Kingdom for five cents at the Washington International Wheat Conference was mainly to maintain domestic wheat prices in order to satisfy the greed of grain monopoly capitalists, but also to reduce the burden of subsidies and alleviate the dissatisfaction of taxpayers.

This selfish plan of the United States cannot but harm the interests of wheat importing countries, especially the United Kingdom, so the United Kingdom resolutely refused to participate in the new agreement. In the United Kingdom, the retail price of bread rose by 90 percent from 1947 to 1952. The wartime food rationing system is still in place, and the rationing amount has decreased rather than increased, and many people cannot afford the rationing goods (including bread). The increase in the price of wheat will directly adversely affect the British economic life. At the same time, an increase of five cents per bushel of wheat means an increase of nearly 10 million US dollars in expenditure for the United Kingdom, which is equivalent to being strongly blackmailed by the United States, which is difficult for the United Kingdom to endure. Therefore, the London "Times" once said: "The difference of five US cents between bargaining is a difference in principle—US domestic policy interferes with international trade—therefore the British government should not concede." James, Chairman of the British Grain Merchants Association, sharply criticized the US subsidy policy aimed at raising grain prices. He said: "The taxpayers or consumers of the United Kingdom are already in difficulty. We cannot protect our own farmers, let alone take care of foreign high-priced producers." Of course, what the US government is taking care of is not the producers, but the agricultural and grain monopoly capitalists.

The United Kingdom dared to withdraw from the "International Wheat Agreement," of course, taking into account the situation that the United States cannot block the source of wheat imported by the United Kingdom. Because the United Kingdom can obtain cheaper "non-agreement wheat" in the free market outside the United States, and does not need to pay US dollars. The British Ministry of Food announced that it has bought 80,000 tons of wheat from Argentina, which will be delivered in July, August and September. If the United Kingdom can get rid of US interference and expand trade with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, the source of wheat will be no problem.

At present, according to British newspapers, the United Kingdom has achieved a victory in the wheat struggle against the United States. The price of US wheat is falling. When the International Wheat Conference passed the new agreement on April 13, the July futures of wheat in the Chicago market were US$2.25 per bushel; by mid-June, it fell to US$1.89, lower than the price of the new agreement; in August, after the new agreement came into effect, the September futures fell to US$1.82. Affected by this, the prices of all US grains have fallen one after another. There are many signs that US wheat will not only continue to fall in price, but also the export volume in the 1953-1954 fiscal year will be further reduced. In short, the US wheat surplus crisis is becoming more and more serious.

From this wheat struggle, people can see that in order to strive for economic independence, the United Kingdom is making every effort to oppose the US interference and control of international trade. This will inevitably promote the intensification of the struggle between the United States and Britain for markets.

    美英两国的小麦斗争
    施迟
    美英两国在资本主义世界小麦市场上的斗争，反映了美英之间的矛盾进一步尖锐化，而且意味着美国对资本主义世界市场的垄断政策正在遭到愈来愈强烈的反抗。最近在小麦斗争中，多年来在资本主义世界市场上横行霸道的美国，第一次在英国的面前栽跟头了。
    今年春天，参加一九四九年“国际小麦协定”的签字国（包括美、加、澳、法等四个输出国，英国、西德、印度等四十二个输入国），在华盛顿举行“国际小麦会议”，讨论重订新协定，因为旧协定到了七月底就要满期。旧协定规定：小麦最高限价每蒲式耳（约合我国五十四斤半）为美金一元八角、最低限价为一元五角（如小麦跌价，每年可减低一角，直至一元二角）；输入国和输出国除了按照协定的配额和价格交易之外，可以在自由市场买卖“非协定小麦”，价格和数量不受限制。在签订旧协定的当时，小麦市场因供过于求而趋向跌价，但美国为了保证本国粮食垄断资本家的利润，不惜采取国家补贴政策来保障“协定小麦”的输出，以维持美国“非协定小麦”的高价，使“非协定小麦”每蒲式耳一直盘旋在二元二角以上，一九五一年时一度高达二元六角；而“协定小麦”也因之始终保持一元八角的最高限价。在华盛顿会议上，美国以小麦最大输出国资格，根据人为的高昂的美国小麦市场价格，要求将新协定的价格提高到二元五角；但以英国为首的输入国坚决反对这个要价，其他输出国也不表示支持。经过两个多月的讨价还价，终于在四月间勉强通过将“国际小麦协定”延长三年，规定每蒲式耳美金二元零五分；但英国仍然拒绝参加新协定，因为它所坚持的价格是每蒲式耳美金两元。
    英国是小麦最大输入国，按照新协定每年要购进一亿七千七百多万蒲式耳，约占全部输入配额的三分之一。因此，英国拒绝参加新协定的行动，不能不削弱了这一协定的作用，并打击了美国垄断资本主义世界小麦市场的计划。近月来美国粮食市场的跌风，就和美英两国的小麦斗争有密切关系。
    美国为什么要操纵“国际小麦协定”呢？这一点，可以从美国小麦滞销和过剩的情况以及美国粮食垄断资本家的利润这两方面去了解。根据协定，对于每一参加国输入或输出的小麦，都规定了数量和价格。因此，作为最大输出国的美国，就可以凭借协定高价倾销它的过剩的小麦。美国农业部曾经公开承认：“这个协定保证给予我们以前所未有的市场。……如果没有签订这个协定，在许多外国市场难以销售我们的小麦。”同时，“这个协定给予我们私商在外国市场竞争的机会，如果没有像这样的协定，他们是无法竞争的。”这就是说，“国际小麦协定”不但保证美国每年输出二亿七千多万蒲式耳“协定小麦”，而且将在自由市场产生影响，使美国得以大量售出“非协定小麦”。
    美国小麦滞销和过剩的情况是非常严重的，这种情况已经加深了美国的农业危机。美国参议员布里奇斯承认：美国农产品已造成“无法处理的剩余”。某些美国报纸更预感到二十年代和三十年代的重演。在这两个美国经济大恐慌的年代中，美国大批小麦和其他谷物因无法销售而倒入海里。一九五一—一九五二年度，由于小麦输出国阿根廷（没有参加“国际小麦协定”）歉收，澳洲小麦因缩小播种面积而减少输出，又由于西欧国家增加小麦的战略储存数量，亚洲和拉丁美洲缺粮国家也吸进很多美国小麦，美国小麦和面粉的输出量一度激增，达到四亿六千万左右蒲式耳，比上一年度几乎多了一倍。但好景不常，到了一九五二—一九五三年度，就减少了百分之三十，只有三亿二千多万蒲式耳了。美国积压的小麦存货，截至去年七月一日止是二亿五千多万蒲式耳，但据今年八月的估计，已经增加到七亿蒲式耳以上。目前，美国的过剩小麦，已多到没有仓库可装，以致纽约“商务日报”竟狂叫“美国唯一的希望是旱灾”，才能解决这些堆积如山的小麦存货。
    美国小麦滞销和过剩的原因，是和资本主义国家经济军事化分不开的。正如马林科夫同志在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的报告中所说：“经济军事化使得这些国家用增税手段来榨取人民的金钱。这一切就把资本主义国家的预算变成亿万富翁掠夺人民的手段，大大缩小人民的购买力，降低对工业品和农产品的需求”，由于资本主义国家加紧扩军备战的结果，普遍引起通货膨胀、物价飞涨、捐税加重，实际工资降低，劳动人民进一步贫困化，而且大批大批地陷入失业和半失业的困境，因而不得不减少小麦、面粉和其他谷物的消费量。在西欧，饲马料已成为工人的主要食物了。同时，又由于美国加紧输出，限制输入，加深了其他资本主义国家“美元荒”的困难，这些国家只得削减美国小麦的输入，而输入不用美元支付的小麦，以减少美汇储备的消耗。
    另一方面，美国国内小麦的消费量也在降低，在一九五二年，每个美国人消费的面粉平均不到一百三十磅，比一九四六年少了百分之十四点七。这不仅由于美国人民购买力缩小，而且是因为粮价太贵，一九五二年美国面包零售价格比一九四七年上涨了百分之二十八。因此，有许多美国人民挨饥受饿，即使美国官方也承认有五分之一的美国家庭吃不饱，虽然有大量的小麦堆积在仓库里霉掉烂掉。
    尽管美国小麦的滞销和过剩情况这样严重，但美国粮食垄断资本家仍然维持高价，以便保证它们的高额利润。它们通过美国政府加重纳税人的负担，利用国家补贴来抵偿“协定小麦”价格和国内价格的差额，并从而抬高国内价格的水平。据“纽约先驱论坛报”的统计，在一九五二——一九五三年度，美国粮食垄断资本获得这种补贴达一亿八千八百万美元，而在一九四九年八月以来，即实行
  “国际小麦协定”的四年中，总计获得六亿美元。应该指出，这种补贴对于美国普通农民并没有什么好处。上面说过，一九四七年至一九五二年美国面包零售价格上涨了百分之二十八，但同期小麦价格却降低了百分之三十。农民所出售的谷物，绝大部分没有达到政府所支持的价格，而是流入自由市场。如在今年六月，政府支持的小麦价格是每蒲式耳二元一角，但农民出售的价格平均只有一元八角八分，最低的甚至在一元五角以下。据一九五二年年底的材料，美国消费者零购粮食的每一美元中，农民的份额只有一角六分，其余的八角四分主要落入美国粮食资本家的荷包。因此，不难理解，这种荒谬绝伦的补贴制度，当然要受到美国人民的反对。美国代表之所以在华盛顿国际小麦会议上与英国为五分钱而闹成僵局，虽然主要是为了维持国内小麦价格，以满足粮食垄断资本家的贪欲，但也想借此减轻补贴金的负担，缓和纳税人的不满情绪。
    美国这种自私自利的打算，不能不损害到小麦输入国、特别是英国的利益，所以，英国断然拒绝参加新协定。在英国，自一九四七年至一九五二年，面包零售价上涨百分之九十。战时的食品配给制至今仍在维持着，而且配给量有减无增，有许多人还买不起配给品（包括面包）。小麦价格的提高，将使英国经济生活直接蒙受更加不利的影响。同时，每蒲式耳小麦增加五分钱，对英国是意味着增加将近一千万美元的支出，这个支出等于受美国的强力敲诈，这是很难使英国忍受的。所以伦敦“泰晤士报”曾经这样说：“在讨价还价之间的五分美金的差别是原则上的差别——美国国内政策干涉国际贸易——因此英国政府不应让步。”英国粮食商协会主席震姆斯更尖锐地抨击美国旨在抬高粮价的补贴政策，他说：“联合王国的纳税人或消费者已很困难，保护不了我们自己的农民，更谈不到照顾外国的高价生产者。”当然，美国政府照顾的不是什么生产者，而是农业和粮食垄断资本家。
    英国敢于退出“国际小麦协定”，当然估计到这样的情况：美国无法阻塞英国输入小麦的来源。因为英国尽可在美国以外的自由市场取得较为廉价的“非协定小麦”，而且不用支付美元。英国粮食部宣布已从阿根廷买了八万吨小麦，分七、八、九三个月交货。如果英国能够摆脱美国的干涉，扩大对苏联和人民民主国家的贸易，小麦来源更不成问题。
    目前，按照英国报纸的说法，英国在对美国的小麦斗争中，已经取得了一个胜利。美国小麦价格正在下跌中。当四月十三日国际小麦会议通过新协定时，芝加哥市场小麦七月份期货是每蒲式耳美金二元二角五分；到六月中旬就跌到一元八角九分，低于新协定的价格；到八月间新协定生效后，九月份期货又跌到一元八角二分。影响所及，美国所有谷物价格都纷纷下跌。有许多迹象显示，美国小麦不但要继续跌价，而且一九五三——一九五四年度的输出量将更加缩小。总之，美国小麦的过剩危机是愈来愈严重了。
    人们从这场小麦斗争中可以看到，英国为了争取经济独立地位，正在竭力反对美国对国际贸易的干涉和控制。这就必将促使美英争夺市场的斗争更加尖锐化。
