    Reply Regarding the Termination of Yang Wanqi's Employment at the North China Administrative Committee Guest House

    A letter from the General Affairs Management Office of the North China Administrative Committee: Regarding the matter of "Why was Yang Wanqi's employment terminated at the North China Administrative Committee Guest House?" published in the "Reader's Letters Summary" column of the People's Daily on May 16th, we have conducted an investigation. The situation is as follows: On November 15th of last year, our guest house needed to hire temporary workers to stoke the boilers for the winter. Yang Wanqi was introduced by Zhang Jinshan, the manager of the private Tongfeng Iron Factory. At that time, both parties verbally agreed on a three-and-a-half-month employment period. When the heating season was extended by half a month, it was agreed to extend the employment for another month. At the end of March this year, Yang Wanqi's employment was terminated as agreed. As for Yang Wanqi's relationship with the nanny Jiang Yuelan, no one interfered; they are now married. However, we did not go through a specific organization to introduce the temporary workers we hired, and we did not sign a contract after hiring them. This is a shortcoming in our work, and we should correct it in the future.

### 关于华北行政委员会招待所解除杨万起工作问题的答复

    关于华北行政委员会招待所解除杨万起工作问题的答复
    华北行政委员会机关事务管理处来信：五月十六日人民日报“读者来信摘要”栏刊载的“华北行政委员会招待所为何解除杨万起的工作”一事，我们已经作了检查。情况是这样的：去年十一月十五日，我处招待所需要雇用冬季烧锅炉的临时工人，经私营同丰铁工厂经理张锦山介绍杨万起前来。当时双方口头商定雇用时间为三个半月。届期因烤火期延长半月，又约定续雇一个月。到今年三月底期满后，杨万起即按约解除工作。至于杨万起和保姆蒋月兰恋爱，并没有任何人干涉；现在他们已经结婚了。但是，我们雇用临时工作人员时，没有通过一定组织介绍，录用后又没有订立合同，这是我们工作中的缺点，今后应该改正。
