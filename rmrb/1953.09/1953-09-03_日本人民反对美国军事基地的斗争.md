    The Japanese people's struggle against American military bases is expanding daily.
    After World War II, in order to turn Japan into a springboard for its aggression in the Far East, the United States manipulated the reactionary Japanese government, using a series of unequal treaties and agreements imposed on the Japanese people, such as the San Francisco "Peace Treaty," the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty," the "U.S.-Japan Administrative Agreement," and the "Facilities and Areas Agreement," which stipulated that Japan would provide military bases to the United States. It frantically expanded military bases in Japan, forcibly tying Japan to the U.S. chariot of aggression. Military bases from the era of Japanese militarism were not only not completely abolished, but more military bases were built. Even according to the official figures released by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries in July of last year, the United States already had 603 military bases and facilities in Japan. According to figures from a survey published by the Japanese "Akahata" newspaper in January of this year, the actual number of U.S. military bases and facilities in Japan has increased to 733, occupying a total of 311,875,490 tsubo of land (one tsubo equals 3.3058 square meters). The United States is also demanding the establishment of 55 more military bases. On Japan's 369,800 square kilometers of land, reaching the summit of Mount Fuji and extending deep into the seabed of Tokyo Bay, there is an American military base every 500 square kilometers on average.
    The U.S. forcing Japan to become a military base is a serious threat to Japan's territorial sovereignty and national survival. It is rare in history for one country to force another to become completely militarized, and the barbaric means by which the U.S. military plunders the land of the Japanese people to build military bases are even more unbearable. There was such an example: the mayor of Higashi-Akiru Village in Nishi-Tama County, Tokyo, was suddenly summoned by the U.S. occupation authorities. He was ordered to sit in a jeep and accompany the U.S. military on a ride around the site of a former Japanese military airport that had long since become farmland. The U.S. military immediately announced to him that they wanted to "borrow" all the land within the circle the jeep had traveled, ordering him to instruct all residents in the area to move out immediately, and then forcibly built barracks there. In many cases, when the U.S. military wanted to occupy the land of Japanese farmers, they instructed the Yoshida government to come forward and coerce the farmers into signing contracts promising to "temporarily use" their land; however, even before the contracts were signed, the land had already been forcibly occupied by the U.S. military.
    The U.S. building military bases in Japan has ruthlessly destroyed the livelihoods of the Japanese people. Once Japanese villages and fishing ports are occupied by the U.S. military as bases, mulberry groves, fields, and houses are violently leveled. Stray bullets from exercises often kill farmers and fishermen at work or cause large fires. Military trucks, recklessly speeding around, run over old people and children everywhere. Regardless of day or night, American soldiers arbitrarily break into farmhouses and fishing huts, raping women and robbing property. The amount of farmland forcibly occupied by the U.S. military is staggering. Even according to a survey report by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of the Yoshida government, in the past year alone, 170,000 acres of cultivated land and forests have been allocated to the U.S. military as airfields and training bases based on the "U.S.-Japan Administrative Agreement" (one acre equals approximately six mu), and plans are being made to allocate another 190,000 acres of land to the U.S. military. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry admits that the requisition of cultivated land by the U.S. military and the Japanese "Security Forces" will reduce Japan's rice production by more than 4.7 million liters per year. At the same time, due to the impact of the U.S. military bases, at least one-fifth of the fishermen in Japan have been deprived of their livelihoods. The U.S. military has designated large areas of the sea near its fishery-related military bases in Japan as prohibited zones, and has designated an area of the sea around Japan equivalent to one-eighth of Japan's total land area as an exercise area. In addition, anti-submarine nets have been laid in fishing areas such as Tokyo Bay and Sasebo. All of these areas, regardless of the size of the fishing boats, are not allowed to approach. As a result, Japan's fish production has decreased by more than 410 million catties per year. The piers of many ports in Japan have been occupied by the U.S. military. 92 percent of the facilities in the port of Tokyo have been forcibly occupied by the U.S. military. Shibaura, Hinode, and Takeshiba wharves are all controlled by the U.S. military. 90 percent of the main wharves in Sasebo port are occupied by the U.S. military. The ports of Yokohama, Kobe, and Moji are also mostly occupied by the U.S. military. The normal commerce of these ports is on the verge of stagnation, and the lives of dockworkers have been severely affected.
    The establishment of American military bases has also devastated Japan's historical relics and national culture, and hindered the research work of Japanese academia. The ancient Kumamoto Castle, a nearly 400-year-old building in Kumamoto City that the Japanese people regard as a national treasure, Mount Fuji, "the symbol of Japan," and many other precious scenic spots and cultural relics with a long history, have now become U.S. military barracks or areas of gunpowder smoke and artillery fire. Science and engineering students at Japanese universities are forced to switch to military-related research. The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries have also established reactionary research organizations in many universities, such as the Military Research Association of Tokyo University. Because the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries control research funding and research subsidies, many impoverished Japanese university professors and technicians are deprived of the freedom of academic research.
    The U.S. military's licentious and violent acts in Japan have become increasingly serious with the expansion of military bases, giving an extremely bad influence on Japanese social customs and children's education. At the "Japanese People's Anti-Military Base Conference" held in Tokyo in late June, representatives compared the U.S. military base areas to festering sores full of pus, and Japanese children grow up in this filthy pus. Even Kunzli, Secretary-General of the American Federation of Teachers, after inspecting the actual situation at the Tachikawa U.S. military base near Tokyo in February of this year, could not help but exclaim: "This is a terrible phenomenon!" "It makes one shudder!"
    As mentioned above, the result of the U.S. building military bases in Japan, even without mentioning the possible threat of Japan being forced into the disaster of war in the future, has already caused direct and indirect serious damage to people of all walks of life in Japan. This is of course absolutely intolerable to the Japanese people, and therefore, the Japanese people's struggle against American military bases is rising day by day.
    Initially, the U.S. occupation authorities instructed the Japanese Yoshida government to use lies such as "temporary use" and "return after the signing of a peace treaty" and other deceptive means to hoodwink the people in every possible way, to try to conceal the truth about the military bases, and to use violence to suppress them, attempting to prevent the Japanese people from rising up in resistance. However, the Japanese people, who have suffered deeply from the oppression and enslavement of the U.S. occupation authorities, are not deceived. With the continuous expansion of U.S. military bases, Japanese workers, farmers, and fishermen have stepped forward to launch struggles. For example, villagers in Itami, Toyonaka, and Ikeda in Hyogo Prefecture removed the fences erected by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries to oppose the expansion of Itami Airport by the U.S. military; villagers in Takashima County, Shiga Prefecture, used methods such as not providing drinking water and digging pits in the roads to oppose the U.S. military's training base; fishermen in Kujukuri Beach, Chiba Prefecture, forced the U.S. military to stop shooting practice, and many other concrete examples vividly illustrate the heroic tenacity of the Japanese people's early struggle against American military bases.
    After the various unequal treaties and agreements signed by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries, especially the "Facilities and Areas Agreement" by which the U.S. forced Japan to provide 603 military bases, were announced, the aggressive face of the U.S. permanently occupying Japanese territory and forcing Japan to become a military base was completely exposed. At the same time, many Japanese progressives and democratic groups formed fact-finding groups on military bases, which exposed the ugly situation of the U.S. military bases. As a result, the Japanese people's struggle against American military bases was widely launched. For example, in the autumn and winter of last year, the Hokkaido people's struggle against the expansion of U.S. military bases gradually developed into a common struggle of unity among workers, farmers, and the broad masses of people in Hokkaido; with the support of the broad masses of people, the people of Nara shattered the U.S. military's plan to establish an air force base in Nara City, the ancient capital of Japan with more than 1,000 precious historical sites; the people of Shizuoka and Nagano prefectures opposed the expansion of the U.S. military base on Mount Fuji, developing into the struggle of the Japanese people against the U.S. military base on Mount Fuji, in which people from a wide range of strata participated.
    Since the beginning of this year, the Japanese people's struggle against American military bases has expanded into a broad, strong, and powerful national people's struggle. The long-term persistent struggle of the people of Uchinada Village in Ishikawa Prefecture and the rapid acquisition of universal sympathy and strong support from the people of the whole country is the most brilliant example. Last September, the U.S. military occupied Uchinada Village as a shooting range. Later, due to the fierce opposition of the local people, the Yoshida government was forced to make a promise to only temporarily hand it over to the U.S. military for four months from January of this year and to take it back by the end of April. However, when the "temporary use" period expired, the Yoshida government not only did not fulfill its promise, but instead decided to designate Uchinada Village as a permanently used shooting range for the U.S. military. This deceptive means of the Yoshida government aroused the great anger of the people of Uchinada Village. With the support of people from all walks of life across the country, the people of Uchinada Village launched a heroic and unyielding struggle. Around the shooting range and the U.S. military barracks, thousands of people every day held up signs reading "Swear to defend Uchinada" to demonstrate. In order to persist in the struggle after the U.S. military implemented shooting practice, the people of Uchinada Village built more than 160 bomb shelters near the shooting range and erected obstacles around the bomb shelters. On June 14, the day before the U.S. military began live ammunition shooting practice, when the first truck carrying U.S. shells was about to drive into Uchinada Village, an old woman lay down in front of the truck and shouted: "I was born on this land, and I will die on this land. If you want to transport shells for shooting practice, drive over me!" That night, more than 800 villagers gathered at the shooting range, including even old people and women in their 80s. In front of more than 1,000 armed policemen of the Yoshida government, they shouted: "Even if cannons bombard us, we will not retreat." On the morning of June 15, the U.S. military cannons brazenly began firing. However, the heroic people, arm in arm, persisted in the struggle. Whenever a shell exploded, they shouted the slogan: "Yankee go home!" For many days after the U.S. military began shooting practice, three to four hundred people in Uchinada Village still stayed day and night in the area where the shells were landing, sleeping on the road leading to the shooting range, and continued to struggle. Later, in order to protect their livelihoods and further break through the barbed wire fence around the shooting range, they sailed their fishing boats into the so-called "restricted area" designated by the U.S. military to fish, despite the Yoshida government's tyrannical suppression.
    The reason why the Japanese people's struggle against American military bases can develop into a powerful national patriotic movement is because it has the leadership of the working class and has formed a worker-peasant alliance and a broad united front of unity among people of all strata in many places. The Ishikawa Prefecture people's struggle against the U.S. military training base in Uchinada Village most clearly illustrates this characteristic. The Japanese working class has always supported the farmer and fisherman brothers in Uchinada Village with its own practical actions. On April 17 of this year, after the Ishikawa Prefecture people held a rally to recapture Uchinada Village under the initiative of the Ishikawa Prefecture Council of Trade Unions, a united front was formed with workers, farmers, and fishermen as the core, including students, the broad masses of citizens, and people from all strata united. Railway, electricity, metal and other major trade union workers in Ishikawa Prefecture jointly fought with the farmers and fishermen in Uchinada Village. In June and July, the national congresses of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the Japan Private Railway Workers' Union, the Japan Teachers' Union, and the All-Japan Federation of Student Self-Government Associations successively passed resolutions to support the people of Uchinada Village. The people of Tokyo held a "Donation Drive and Anti-Military Base Signature Campaign Week to Support the People of Uchinada Village" from July 11th to 17th. In the ranks of petitioning in front of the Diet and holding sit-in demonstrations at the Uchinada Village shooting range to fight against the U.S. military training base in Uchinada Village, there were not only workers, students, teachers, staff members, and other righteous people, but also monks wearing robes. The monks of Myohoji Temple in Nihonbashi, Tokyo, also held a hunger strike to support the people of Uchinada Village. Kyodo News Service could not but admit: "The breadth of the strata of this movement (referring to the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S. military establishing a training base in Uchinada Village) is unparalleled in past such movements."
    The Japanese people's struggle against American military bases in various parts of Japan has developed into an important link in the entire Japanese people's struggle for national independence. This struggle will persist and expand on a more united and unified basis. In late June of this year, under the initiative and preparation of the Japanese Communist Party, the Japan Labor-Farmer Party, the Japan Peace Committee, the Japan-China Friendship Association, the Japan-Soviet Friendship Association, and more than 20 other progressive political parties and democratic groups, 479 military base representatives from 39 prefectures, Hokkaido, and prefectures across Japan convened the "Japanese People's Anti-Military Base Conference" in Tokyo. The conference representatives unanimously agreed that it is necessary to learn from the successful experience of the people of Uchinada Village and Mount Asama in fighting against the U.S. military bases, strengthen and expand the united front, and expand this struggle into a struggle of the people of the whole country. In order to achieve this goal, the conference decided to establish a national anti-military base struggle organization in the center, establish corresponding organizations in various places, communicate and support each other, and organize the strength of all groups and individuals across the country that oppose U.S. military bases. The conference resolved to demand the abolition of the San Francisco "Peace Treaty," the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty," the "U.S.-Japan Administrative Agreement," and other traitorous treaties.
    Currently, the Japanese people's struggle against American military bases is booming across the country. In Mount Asama, the powerful pressure of the Japanese people finally forced the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries to announce on July 12 that they would abandon their plan to forcibly occupy Mount Asama to establish a base. In Yamagata Prefecture, the local people are conducting a signature campaign demanding the removal of the U.S. military bases within the prefecture. In Aomori Prefecture, the struggle against the U.S. military using the Mount Iwaki area within the prefecture as a training base is expanding. In Okayama Prefecture, under the leadership of the Okayama Prefecture Council of Trade Unions, the local people have launched a struggle against the U.S. military's preparation to use the former Japanese Army training base. In Hokkaido, fishermen in Oshima Village, Hakodate, are continuing to wage a struggle against the U.S. military establishing a gunboat base; the people of Sapporo City forced the U.S. military to announce on July 16 that it would abandon the use of the Tsukisamu shooting range in Sapporo City. In addition, the people of Fukuoka, Shiga, Aichi, Kyoto, and Nagano have convened or are preparing to convene all-prefecture anti-American military base conferences.
    The increasing expansion of the Japanese people's struggle against American military bases powerfully demonstrates that under the leadership of the Japanese working class, the political consciousness of Japanese farmers, fishermen, and the broad masses of people has been significantly improved, the unity of the people of all strata in Japan is being consolidated and expanded, and the strength of the Japanese people is rapidly growing.

    日本人民反对美国军事基地的斗争
    徐明
    日本人民反对美国军事基地的斗争，正在日益扩展。
    第二次世界大战后，美国为了把日本变为它侵略远东的跳板，操纵日本反动政府，利用一连串强加在日本人民身上的旧金山单独“和约”、“美日安全条约”、“美日行政协定”以及规定日本向美国提供军事基地的“设施与区域协定”等不平等条约和协定，在日本疯狂地扩建军事基地，强把日本缚上了美国的侵略战车。过去日本军国主义时代的军事基地不仅未被完全废毁，而且更多的军事基地已被建筑起来。即使按照去年七月美、日反动派官方公布的数字，美国在日本的军事基地和设施就已达六百零三处。根据日本“赤旗报”发表的今年一月间调查的数字，实际上美国在日本的军事基地和设施已经增加到七百三十三处，霸占土地多达三亿一千一百八十七万五千四百九十坪（每坪合三·三○五八平方公尺），美国正在要求建立军事基地的还有五十五处。日本全国三十六万九千八百余平方公里的土地上，高及富士山之巅，深至东京湾海底，平均每五百平方公里，就有美国的军事基地一处。
    美国强使日本军事基地化，是对日本领土主权和民族生存的严重威胁。一个国家强使另一个国家完全军事基地化，这在历史上是少见的，而美国军队为了建筑军事基地掠夺日本人民土地的蛮横手段，更是令人不堪忍受。曾经有这样一个事例：东京都西多摩郡东秋留村的村长突然被美国占领军当局传去，他被命令坐在吉普车上，陪同美军乘车环绕早已成为农田的前日本军用机场的遗址兜了一圈后，美军立即向他宣布要“借用”吉普车所绕过的圈子中的全部土地，要他限令该地区所有居民迅即迁出，随即强行在该处建筑起兵营来。在许多场合，美军要占用日本农民的土地时，就吩咐吉田政府出面胁迫农民签订承诺“暂时使用”他们土地的契约；但是，甚至契约还没有签订前，土地就已被美军强占了。
    美国在日本强筑军事基地，残暴地破坏了日本人民的生计。日本的农村、渔港，一经被美军占作基地，桑林、田地和房舍就被狂暴地铲平。演习的枪炮流弹常常射死在工作中的农民、渔民，或引起大火灾。横冲直闯的军用卡车到处压死老人和小孩。不管白天夜晚，美国兵任意冲入农家和渔舍蹂躏妇女和抢劫财物。美军强占的耕地面积数字是惊人的。即使按照吉田政府农林省的调查报告，仅最近一年来根据“美日行政协定”划给美军做飞机场和演习基地的耕地和森林，就已达十七万英亩（一英亩约合六市亩），并且准备再将十九万英亩的土地划给美军。农林省承认，由于美军和日本“保安队”对耕地的征用，将使日本米产量每年减少四百七十多万公升。同时，由于美军基地的影响，日本全国至少有五分之一的渔民被剥夺了生计。美军在日本与渔业有关的军事基地附近，都划出很大面积的海面作为禁区，并在日本四周划出相当于日本全国陆地面积八分之一的海面作为演习区，此外，还在东京湾和佐世保等渔区布设了防潜艇网，所有这些地区，无论大小渔船，一概不准近前，日本的鱼产量因而每年减少了四亿一千多万斤。日本许多港口的码头都已被美军霸占，东京港口的设备被美军强占了百分之九十二，芝浦、日出、竹芝等码头全部为美军控制，佐世保港的主要码头百分之九十为美军占用，横滨、神户、门司的港口也大部被美军占用。这些港口的正常商务已濒于停顿，码头工人生活受到严重影响。
    美国军事基地的设置也摧残了日本的历史文物和民族文化，阻挠了日本学术界的研究工作。日本人民视为国宝的、位于熊本市内有近四百年历史的古代建筑熊本城，“日本的象征”富士山以及许多珍贵的名胜地区和悠久的文化遗迹，现在都已成为美军兵营或硝烟炮火之区。日本各大学理工科学生被迫转作军事性的研究。美、日反动派并在许多大学中建立类如东京大学军事研究会的反动研究组织。由于美、日反动派掌握着研究费及研究津贴费，迫使陷于贫困中的日本许多大学教授和技术人员失去学术研究的自由。
    美军在日本的荒淫暴行随着军事基地的扩大而日趋严重，给予日本社会风气和儿童教育以极端恶劣的影响。六月下旬在东京举行的“日本人民反对军事基地大会”上代表们的发言，曾把美军基地地区比做长满了污脓的烂疮，日本儿童就在这污秽的疮脓中生长。甚至连美国教师联合会总书记库恩兹利在今年二月间视察了东京附近立川美军基地的实际情况后，也不禁惊叹说：“这真是可怕的现象！”“叫人不寒而栗！”
    如上所述，美国在日本建筑军事基地的结果，即便不谈将来日本被迫卷入战争灾祸的可能威胁，就在眼前也已使日本各阶层人民都受到了直接和间接的严重损害。这当然绝对不是日本人民所能忍受的，因而，日本人民反对美国军事基地的斗争也就一天天地高涨起来。
    最初，美国占领当局曾指使日本吉田政府以
    “暂时使用”、“签订和约后即可发还”等等谎言和其他种种欺骗手段，千方百计地蒙蔽人民，竭力掩盖军事基地的真相，并使用暴力进行镇压，企图防止日本人民起来反抗。然而，深受美国占领当局压迫和奴役的日本人民是不受欺骗的。随着美军基地的不断扩充，日本工人、农民和渔民就挺身起来展开了斗争。如兵库县伊丹、丰中、池田的村民，用拔除美、日反动派打下的圈地栅栏以反对美军扩大伊丹飞机场；滋贺县高岛郡村民用不给饮水、在道路上挖坑等手段反对美军演习基地；千叶县九十九里滨渔民迫使美军停止打靶等等许多斗争的具体事例，都生动地说明了日本人民初期反对美国军事基地斗争的英勇顽强。
    美日反动派签订的各种不平等的条约和协定、特别是美国强迫日本提供六百零三处军事基地的“设施与区域协定”公布后，美国永久霸占日本领土和强使日本军事基地化的侵略面目完全暴露。同时，许多日本进步人士和民主团体组成的军事基地实况调查团，又把美军基地的丑恶情况揭露出来。于是，日本人民反对美国军事基地的斗争就广泛地展开。如在去年秋冬间，北海道人民的反对美军扩大基地的斗争，逐渐发展为北海道工人、农民和广大人民团结一致的共同的斗争；奈良人民在广大人民的声援下，粉碎了美军在日本的故都、有着一千多件珍贵古迹的奈良市建立空军基地的计划；静冈、长野两县人民反对美军在富士山扩充基地，发展为各地广泛阶层人民参加的日本人民反对富士山美军基地的斗争等等。
    今年以来，日本人民反对美国军事基地的斗争，更扩展成为规模广阔、坚强有力的全国人民的斗争了。石川县内滩村人民的长期坚持斗争并迅速获得全国人民的普遍同情和有力支援，就是最辉煌的例证。去年九月美军就霸占了内滩村为打靶场，其后由于当地人民的激烈反对，迫使吉田政府作出仅交给美军从今年一月起临时使用四个月、到四月底就收回的诺言。可是到“临时使用”期满时，吉田政府不仅没有履行诺言，反而决定把内滩村划给美军作永久使用的打靶场。吉田政府这种欺诈手段激起了内滩村人民的巨大愤怒，内滩村人民在全国各阶层人民的声援下，展开了英勇不屈的斗争。在打靶场和美国兵营的周围，每天都有成千的人高举着“誓死保卫内滩”的标语进行示威。为了在美军实行打靶后坚持斗争，内滩村人民在打靶场附近筑起了一百六十多个避弹所，并在避弹所的四周架设了障碍物。美军开始实弹打靶的前一日——六月十四日，当第一辆卡车载着美国炮弹将要驶进内滩村时，一位老妇人横卧在卡车前喊道：“我生在这块土地上，我死也要死在这块土地上，你们要想运炮弹来打靶，就从我身上开过去吧！”这天晚上，有八百多村民聚集在打靶场，其中甚至有八十多岁的老人和妇女。他们在一千多名吉田政府的武装警察面前高喊着：“即使大炮轰击，我们也不后退”。六月十五日的早晨，美军的大炮蛮横地开始射击了。可是英雄的人民臂挽着臂，坚持着斗争。每当一颗炮弹爆发时，他们就高喊一声：“美国佬滚回去！”的口号。在美军开始打靶以后的许多日子里，内滩村人民仍然有三、四百人日夜守在落弹地区，睡在通往打靶场的道路上，继续进行斗争。后来，他们为了保卫自己的生计，并进一步突破了打靶场四周的铁丝网，不顾吉田政府的横暴镇压，把渔船驶入美军划定的所谓“禁区”内去捕鱼。
    日本人民反对美国军事基地的斗争所以能发展为强大的全国规模的爱国运动，是由于有工人阶级的领导，在许多地方结成了工农联盟和各阶层人民团结一致的广泛统一战线。石川县人民反对内滩村美军演习基地的斗争，最清楚地说明了这个特点。日本工人阶级始终以自己的实际行动支援了内滩村的农民和渔民弟兄。今年四月十七日，石川县人民在石川县工会总评议会发起下举行了夺回内滩村大会后，形成了以工人、农民、渔民为核心包括学生、广大市民及各阶层人民团结一致的统一战线。石川县的铁路、电气、金属等各主要工会工人都和内滩村农民渔民一起共同进行了斗争。六、七月间，日本工会总评议会、日本私营铁道总联合会、日本教职员工会和全日本学生自治会总联合会先后召开的全国大会，都通过决议支援内滩村人民。东京市人民曾在七月十一日到十七日举办了“支援内滩村人民募捐及反对军事基地签名运动周”。在国会前请愿和在内滩村打靶场静坐示威进行反对内滩村美军演习基地斗争的队伍里，不仅有工人、学生、教师、职员和其他的正义人士，而且还有披着袈裟的和尚。东京日本桥妙法寺的和尚也曾为支援内滩村人民而举行绝食。共同社也不能不承认：“这个运动
    （指日本人民反对美军在内滩村建立演习基地的斗争）阶层的广泛，是过去这类运动所不能比拟的。”
    日本全国各地人民反对美国军事基地的斗争，已经发展成为整个日本人民争取民族独立斗争中的一个重要的环节。这一斗争将在更加团结和统一的基础上坚持和扩展。今年六月下旬，在日本共产党、日本劳农党、日本拥护和平委员会、日中友好协会、日苏亲善协会等二十几个进步政党和民主团体的发起筹备下，日本全国三十九个都、道、府、县军事基地代表四百七十九人，在东京召开了“日本人民反对军事基地大会”。大会代表一致认为要学习内滩村和浅间山人民反对美军基地斗争的胜利经验，加强和扩大统一战线，把这一斗争扩展成为日本全国人民的斗争。为了达到这一目标，大会决定在中央成立全国性的反对军事基地斗争的组织，在各地成立相应的组织，互相联络支援，把全国人民反对美军基地的一切团体和个人的力量组织起来。大会决议，要求废除旧金山单独“和约”、“美日安全条约”、“美日行政协定”等卖国条约。
    目前，日本人民反对美国军事基地的斗争正在全国各地蓬勃扩展。在浅间山，日本人民的强大压力终于迫使美、日反动派于七月十二日宣布放弃强占浅间山建立基地的计划。在山形县，当地人民正在进行签名运动，要求撤除县境内的美军基地。在青森县，反对美军把县境内岩木山一带作为演习基地的斗争正在扩大。在冈山县，当地人民在冈山县工会总评议会领导下，展开了反对美军准备使用旧日本陆军演习基地的斗争。在北海道，函馆的大岛村渔民正继续展开反对美军设立炮舰基地的斗争；札幌市人民迫使美军在七月十六日宣布放弃使用札幌市的月寒打靶场。此外，福冈、滋贺、爱知、京都、长野各地人民已经召开了或正在准备召开全县人民的反对美国军事基地大会。
    日本人民反对美国军事基地斗争的日益扩展，强有力地说明了在日本工人阶级的领导下，日本农民、渔民及广大人民的政治觉悟有了显著的提高，日本各阶层人民的团结正在巩固和扩大，日本人民的力量是迅速地强大起来了。
