Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 9th: The Chief Member of the Korean-Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission received a letter from the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission on September 8th, reporting a serious incident in which US soldier Armstrong violently punched Captain Larsson, a Swedish member of the Neutral Nations Inspection Team stationed in Daegu, on September 1st, injuring his jaw and causing bleeding from his lips and teeth. The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission requested the right to discuss this issue after the US investigation.

Captain Larsson submitted a written report to the Daegu Neutral Nations Inspection Team describing the incident on September 1st: "I handed a draft telegram to Private First Class Armstrong, who serves in the Neutral Nations Inspection Team office, to type on the prescribed telegram form. I told him that the telegram did not need the Liaison Officer's signature. Four minutes later, Armstrong returned to the secretariat to find me and said: If the telegram does not have the Liaison Officer's signature, this telegram cannot be sent. I told him again that it was not necessary to have the Liaison Officer's signature on this telegram, and it should be signed by an officer of the Neutral Nations Inspection Team. Armstrong insisted on his opinion in an impolite manner, so I ordered him to leave the secretariat and type the telegram. He said impulsively: You can't control me. I told him sternly that he was in the area of the four neutral nations and was serving the four neutral nations, so he must accept the orders of the neutral nations representatives. After speaking, I strictly ordered him to leave the secretariat and type this telegram. Armstrong replied: You can't control me. At the same time, he punched my jaw. When he tried to hit my head, I pushed him out of the secretariat. This punch caused a severe headache, and my teeth and lips were bleeding."

The letter from the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission also included a signed letter from the four chief members of the Daegu Neutral Nations Inspection Team. The Daegu Neutral Nations Inspection Team believes that the US Liaison Officer is related to this incident and requests an investigation and his replacement.

At the meeting on September 9th, General Li Sang-cho, the Chief Member of the Korean-Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission, pointed out that the US personnel's assault on the personnel of the Neutral Nations Inspection Team not only violated the relevant provisions of the Armistice Agreement but also insulted the entire Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. The Korean-Chinese side resolutely demands that the US immediately take effective and practical measures to prevent the occurrence of similar incidents and ensure the thorough implementation of the relevant provisions of the Armistice Agreement.

    美军人员殴打驻大邱的中立国视察小组的瑞典人员
    我方要求美方采取措施制止同类事件发生
    【新华社开城九日电】军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员收到中立国监察委员会九月八日的来信，报告驻大邱的中立国视察小组的瑞典人员拉尔逊上尉在九月一日被美方士兵阿姆斯特朗猛殴下颚受伤、唇齿出血的严重事件。中立国监察委员会要求保留在美方调查后讨论这一问题的权利。
    拉尔逊上尉向驻大邱的中立国视察小组书面报告他在九月一日被殴打的经过说：我交了一份电稿给在中立国视察小组办公室服务的一等兵阿姆斯特朗，去缮写在规定的电报式样上。我告诉他在电报上，不必有联络官的署名。四分钟后，阿姆斯特朗回到秘书处找我，并说：如果在电报上没有联络官署名，这封电报就不能发出。我再一次告诉他，缮写这封电报不必有联络官的署名，应该由中立国视察小组的一位军官签署。阿姆斯特朗以无礼的态度坚持他的意见，因此我命令他离开秘书处去缮写电报。他冲动地说：你管不着我，我当时严词告诉他，他是在四个中立国的地区内，并为四个中立国服务，因此必须接受中立国代表的命令。说完以后，我严厉地命令他离开秘书处去缮写这份电报。阿姆斯特朗回答说：你管不着我。同时他举拳打我的下颚，当他还想打我的头的时候，我把他推出了秘书处。这一拳引起了剧烈的头痛，而且我的牙齿和嘴唇都被打得流血了。
    在中立国监察委员会的信中，并附有大邱中立国视察小组四个中立国首席组员的签名信。大邱中立国视察小组认为美方联络官与这一事件有关，要求进行调查并将他撤换。
    军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员李相朝将军在九日的会议上，指出美方人员殴打中立国视察小组人员，不仅违反了停战协定的有关条款，而且是对中立国监察委员会全体的侮辱。朝中方面坚决地要求美方立即采取有效的实际的措施，以制止同类事件的发生，保障停战协定的有关条款的贯彻执行。
