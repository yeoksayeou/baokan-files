The medical personnel of the Shanxi Jinsheng Textile Factory, in order to safeguard the health of employees and continuously improve labor productivity, organized medical staff and concentrated their efforts on treating workers' "occupational diseases" – digestive system ailments – and achieved excellent results. Over a period of thirty-eight days, out of 138 digestive system patients in the factory, 59 were completely cured, and 51 were significantly improved.

Gastrointestinal diseases are a very common type of "occupational disease" among textile workers. The medical staff of the factory, through specific analysis during this treatment, found that the causes of gastrointestinal diseases were roughly as follows: lax management of nearby vendors and a lack of necessary hygiene education for employees. For example, the factory's front and back gates often gathered many vendors who specialized in providing employees with snacks and cold foods. These vendors generally had no sanitary facilities, and the food they sold was extremely unsanitary, which could easily cause diseases of the digestive system. In addition, the factory's working hours were in three shifts. Workers on the early shift started work at 6:00 a.m. and worked until 2:00 p.m. After work, they attended meetings and study sessions, sometimes not eating until around 5:00 p.m. Eating irregularly, with uneven periods of hunger and satiety, caused digestive system diseases over time. Some workers on the middle shift went to bed immediately after eating dinner after getting off work at 10:00 p.m. Some female workers had to take care of household chores after work, being exhausted all day long, and thus overly fatigued. These were also among the causes of gastrointestinal diseases.

Before conducting health examinations of employees this time, the medical personnel of the Jinsheng Textile Factory first organized themselves and divided their work according to workshops and residential areas, changing from waiting for treatment to actively providing medical services, reducing the waiting time for patients. They used the time saved to focus on solving the diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases. After achieving considerable results, when patients began to automatically request treatment, they specifically assigned one doctor to be responsible for the treatment, thus solving the difficulties of lacking doctors and time. At the beginning of the treatment, they conducted thorough examinations of the patients, classified various digestive system diseases, and then combined the effective methods used by each doctor in past treatments with advanced Soviet therapies to treat different gastrointestinal diseases with different methods. According to the experimental results, deep-seated gastrointestinal diseases can be cured with the advanced Soviet blood-lysing therapy in about ten treatments. For example, comrades like Zhang Sen of the factory, who had suffered from gastrointestinal diseases for nearly two years, are now working happily after blood-lysing therapy. Before the promotion of blood-lysing therapy, many employees were skeptical about this method, but after the treatment of comrades with severe gastrointestinal diseases, they went to the workshops to promote it, and the number of people requesting blood-lysing treatment increased day by day. In addition, the factory also combined treatment with prevention work. When making diagnoses, the factory's doctors also paid attention to explaining the sources of the diseases to the patients, the need for a normal diet, and the development of regular hygiene habits, enlightening and educating employees on paying attention to their lifestyle habits, which also promoted the effectiveness of the treatment. For example, Zhang Yongxi, a worker in the spinning workshop, listened to the doctor's advice and changed his habits of eating snacks and sleeping after meals. His gastrointestinal diseases of many years were cured after three treatments. The factory cafeteria also increased the supply of sesame cakes, fried dough twists, and soybean milk, based on the employees' working conditions and dietary needs, and the number of people eating snacks from vendors was relatively reduced. At the same time, they also conducted publicity and education among the family members of employees, so that workers could get appropriate food after work and reduce the excessive burden of housework. The factory also appropriately streamlined meeting times to reduce workers' fatigue and allow them to get adequate rest. As a result of these measures, workers' digestive system diseases have been greatly reduced.

    治疗工人“职业病”收效显著
    山西省晋生纺织厂为保障职工健康，继续提高劳动生产率，组织了医务人员，集中力量治疗工人的“职业病”——消化系疾病，获得了很好的成绩。经过三十八天时间，该厂一百三十八个消化系病患者，有五十九人彻底痊愈，五十一人基本好转。
    肠胃病是纺织工人中很普遍的一种“职业病”，该厂医务人员这次在治疗中经过具体分析，发现造成肠胃病的原因大致是：对附近摊贩管理不严，对职工缺乏必要的卫生教育，如该厂的前后大门经常聚集着许多摊贩，专门供给职工吃零食冷食等，这些摊贩一般都无卫生设备，所售食物极不清洁，吃了容易引起消化系的疾病。另外，该厂的工作时间是三班制的，早班工人上午六点上班，一直工作到下午两点钟，下班后开会学习，有时要饿到下午五时左右才能吃饭，吃饭不按时，饥饱不匀，积年累月，就造成消化系的疾病；有些做中班的工人晚上十时下班后吃完饭便马上睡觉，有些女工下班后回家还要办理家务，终日操劳，因而过分疲劳，这些也是引起肠胃疾病的原因之一。
    晋生纺织厂医务人员这次进行职工健康检查之前，首先组织起来按照车间、家属地区等分工，把等待治疗改为主动出诊，减少了等待病人的时间，把节余时间专门来解决肠胃病的诊断与治疗，待收得相当效果后，患者开始自动要求治疗时，则专门抽出医师一人负责治疗，因而解决了缺乏医生缺乏时间的困难。在治疗开始时，他们把病人作了细密的检查，将各种消化系疾病划分类型，然后将各个医生对已往治疗中的特效办法和苏联的先进疗法结合起来，对不同肠胃病施以不同治疗办法。根据实验的结果，程度较深的肠胃病，只要用苏联的先进溶血疗法，有十次左右即可痊愈。如该厂张森等同志将近二年来的肠胃病，经过溶血疗法，现在他们都很愉快的工作了。当溶血疗法推行之前，许多职工对这一办法抱怀疑的态度，但经过患肠胃病程度较深的同志治疗以后，到车间进行宣传，于是要求溶血治疗的人便日益增加。此外，该厂还结合治疗进行预防工作。该厂医师在开始诊断的时候，同时注意了对患者说明得病的来源和需要正常的饮食，以及养成经常的卫生习惯等，启发教育了职工对生活习惯的注意，同时也促进了治疗效果。如细纱间工人张永喜听了医师的话，改变了吃零食、饭后睡觉的习惯，多年来的肠胃病经过三次治疗就痊愈了。该厂食堂又根据职工工作情况和饮食需要，增加了饼子、麻叶、豆浆等，到摊贩吃零食的人就相对减少了。同时他们对职工家属也进行了宣传教育，使工人下班后得到适当的饮食，并减少了对家务的过重负担。工厂方面也适当地精简了会议时间，减轻工人的疲劳，使他们得到适当的休息。由于采取了以上这些措施，工人消化系疾病便大大减少了。
