    The First National Coal Mine Geological Drilling Work Experience Exchange Conference in April 1953 indicated the direction, tasks, and future efforts of coal mine geological drilling work, thus reversing the serious and adverse situation in coal mine geological drilling work in the past. The Fuel Industry Publishing House compiled the relevant documents (reports and experience exchanges) of the conference and the "Draft Technical Management Regulations for Coalfield Geological Drilling" into a book, which is the "How to Do Coal Mine Geological Drilling Well" that I am going to introduce now.

    We know that to put the country on the road to industrialization, we must ensure the rapid development of heavy industry, and one of the prerequisites for ensuring the rapid development of heavy industry is to increase coal production. Lenin once said in his speech at the First All-Russian Miners' Union Congress in 1920: Coal is the food of industry, and without this food, other industries cannot move. According to our current situation, the most effective way to increase coal production is undoubtedly to rapidly build a large number of new mines and renovate old mines. Here, coal mine geological exploration work has a particularly important significance.

    In the past few years, under the correct leadership of the Party, due to the learning of the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and the promotion of the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, coal mine geological drilling work has achieved certain results. However, we must recognize that the current coal mine geological drilling work is far from keeping up with the requirements of the development of the coal mining industry. The design of geological drilling is sometimes still lagging behind the construction of drilling projects, and administrative management and technical management have not fully adapted to the requirements of the site. The chaotic phenomenon of no one being responsible is still very serious. Problems such as low efficiency, poor quality, many accidents, and high costs still exist in many areas. There are even phenomena of missing coal seams during drilling and failing to produce correct geological reports after drilling.

    It can be seen that today geological drilling work is still a weak link in the basic construction of the fuel industry, and it is still seriously lagging behind the requirements of national construction. The first five-year plan stipulates that a number of new mines must be started and a number of old mines must be renovated, so we urgently need to provide a large amount of reliable geological data as soon as possible. Then, how can we successfully complete this glorious and arduous task? First of all, "geological exploration work must be placed in the primary position of basic construction to give full play to its vanguard role" (page 10-11 of the original book). According to the development of work and the current situation, technical management must be strengthened, a responsibility system must be established, and quality must be guaranteed. The specific practices are mainly: strengthening ideological leadership and political education; learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union; relying on the masses to overcome bureaucratic work style; reorganizing organizational leadership according to the characteristics of geological drilling work, changing the chaotic phenomenon of weak cadres and no one being responsible; strengthening specific on-site leadership; establishing an economic accounting system, practicing thrift, and opposing waste.

    The book explains the above issues in detail with vivid examples. In particular, the eight instructions put forward by Minister Chen Yu of the Ministry of Fuel Industry based on national needs and actual on-site possibilities (see pages 7-8 of the original book) must be carefully studied and observed by every leader and executor of geological drilling work. Many facts powerfully prove that the units that do this have achieved results, while those that do not have caused great losses to the country.

    How to improve the efficiency and quality of drilling is the most important issue in geological drilling work. In the two reports, "Monthly Progress of 'Drilling Work' in Coalfield Drilling and Methods of Improving It" and "Responsibilities of Driller and Core Recorder," Soviet experts introduced a lot of advanced experience and made accurate analysis and research on the specific facts in our country's drilling work, pointing out the causes and harms of low efficiency and poor quality, and put forward possible and necessary technical indicators. Soviet experts believe that if the role of the driller, squad leader, and core recorder of the drilling team is strengthened, the technical level and awareness of all staff are improved, and geological and technical leadership and organizational leadership are improved, ... then the drilling work will definitely achieve good results. We must pay attention to these reports.

    In the experience exchange section, the article "Several Experiences on Drilling Work" systematically describes issues such as bottomhole pressure, the use of drill bits, quality, mud, rapid drilling, and reasonable coordination of working hours, and explains them with various tables and calculation formulas. Then, the book introduces in more detail the experience of the Ma Wenzhi drilling team of Fuxin Mining Bureau and the Sun Dianfu team of Jixi Mining Bureau in safe and rapid deep drilling. The characteristics are first of all the scientific use of mud. In terms of drilling speed, the rotation speed and the corresponding drill bit are determined according to different rock formations; secondly, various systems are established, such as the shift system, the mechanical inspection system, the chart operation system, and the meeting system, and clear division of labor and mutual assistance are achieved. All these experiences need to be vigorously promoted by us. In addition, "because the main object of geological exploration in coal mines is 'coal', if the drilling quality is not high, it will directly affect the correctness of the design data for future shaft sinking and mining and tunneling" (page 89 of the original book); therefore, the experience of "Yingcheng Coal Mine improving drilling quality after implementing regulations and systems" and the "soft rock sampling tube" created by Comrade Gao Jianming of the Jixi Mining Bureau Geological Drilling Company are particularly worthy of popularization. Experience has proved that as long as the "soft rock sampling tube" is used, the coal core recovery rate can be guaranteed to reach more than 85%, which is an extremely outstanding achievement.

    Directional drilling is a major contribution of the Soviet Union to the drilling industry, and it has significant value and significance in terms of technology and economy. The book also introduces some successful experiences of the Jixi Drilling Company in trying this method. This powerfully proves the preciousness of the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and the importance of striving to learn from the Soviet Union.

    Finally, although this book is entitled "How to Do Coal Mine Geological Drilling Well", its content is not limited to coal mine geology. All geological drilling work has many common points. Therefore, for all petroleum, non-ferrous metals, hydropower construction, and even general site geological drilling workers, this book also has research and reference value.

    介绍“怎样做好煤矿地质钻探工作”
    汪华东
    燃料工业出版社一九五三年八月编辑出版  新华书店发行
    一九五三年四月第一次全国煤矿地质钻探工作经验交流大会，指示了煤矿地质钻探工作的方针、任务以及今后努力的方向，从而扭转了过去煤矿地质钻探工作方面的严重恶劣情况。燃料工业出版社把大会有关文件（报告及经验交流）和“煤田地质钻探技术管理规程草案”，汇编成书，它就是我现在所要介绍的“怎样做好煤矿地质钻探工作”。
    我们知道，要使国家走上工业化的道路，必须保证重工业的迅速发展，而保证重工业迅速发展的前提之一就是提高煤炭的开采量。列宁在一九二○年第一届全俄矿工工会代表大会上的演说中曾经说过：煤是工业的食粮，没有这种食粮，其他工业就不能动了。根据我们当前的情况，提高煤炭开采量的最有效的方法，无疑地是迅速大量建设新矿井和改建旧矿井。在这里，煤矿地质勘探工作有其特别重要的意义。
    几年来，在党的正确领导下，由于学习了苏联的先进经验，发挥了群众的积极性与创造性，煤矿地质钻探工作业已取得一定的成绩。但是，我们必须认识，目前煤矿地质钻探工作还远远跟不上煤矿工业建设发展的要求。地质钻探的设计有时仍落后于钻探工程的施工，行政管理和技术管理也未能完全适应现场的要求，无人负责的混乱现象还非常严重，效率低、质量差、事故多、成本高等等问题在不少地区依然存在，甚至在钻进中还有遗漏了煤层，打完了钻做不出正确的地质报告的现象。
    由此可见，今天地质钻探工作仍旧是燃料工业基本建设中的薄弱环节，它还严重地落后于国家建设的要求。第一个五年计划规定必须开工建设若干新矿井和改建若干旧矿井，因而急需我们尽速提出许多可靠的地质资料。那末，怎样才能胜利地完成这个光荣而艰巨的任务呢？首先“必须将地质探勘工作放在基本建设的首要地位，发挥其先锋作用”（原书第一○——一一页）。而根据工作的发展及目前情况，必须加强技术管理，建立责任制和保证质量。其具体做法主要是：加强思想领导和政治教育；学习苏联先进经验；依靠群众，克服官僚主义作风；按照地质钻探工作的特点来整顿组织领导，改变干部弱和无人负责的混乱现象；加强现场的具体领导；建立经济核算制，厉行节约，反对浪费。
    对于上述这些问题，书中都分别以生动的事例加以深刻的说明。尤其是燃料工业部陈郁部长根据国家需要和现场实际可能而提出的八条指示（见原书第七——八页），更是我们每一个地质钻探工作的领导者和执行者必须认真研究和遵守的。很多事实有力的证明，那个单位这样做了，就取得了成绩，反之就给国家造成很大的损失。
    如何提高钻探的效率和质量，这是地质钻探工作中最重要的问题。苏联专家在“煤田钻眼‘钻进工作月进度’及其提高的方法”和“钻机机长和岩心记录员的职责”两篇报告中，介绍了很多先进经验，并就我国钻探工作中的具体事实，加以精确的分析和研究，指出了效率低、质量差的原因和危害性，提出了可能和必须提高的技术指标。苏联专家认为：如果加强钻探小组的机长、班长和岩心记录员的作用，提高全体工作人员的技术水平和自觉性，改善地质技术领导和组织领导，……就一定能使钻探工作得到良好的成绩。我们必须重视这些报告。
    在经验交流部分，“关于钻探工作的几点经验”一文系统地叙述了井底压力、钻头的使用、质量、泥浆、快速钻进以及作业时间合理配合等问题，并用种种表格及计算公式加以说明。接着书中更详细介绍了阜新矿务局马文志钻探小组和鸡西矿务局孙殿福小组深部安全快速钻进的经验。其特点首先是科学地使用泥浆，在钻机速率方面，根据不同岩层，分别决定转速和使用与之相适应的钻头；其次是建立各种制度，如交接班制、机械检查制、图表作业制和会议制等，并做到明确分工和互相帮助。所有这些经验，都是需要我们大力推广的。此外，“因为煤矿的地质勘察主要对象是‘煤’，如果钻探质量不高，就会直接影响到将来开凿竖井和采掘、送道的设计资料的正确性”，（原书第八九页）；所以，“营城煤矿贯彻执行规程制度后提高了钻探质量”的经验和鸡西矿务局地质钻探公司高见明同志创造的“软岩采取管”，就特别值得普遍推广。经验证明：只要应用了“软岩采取管”，就能够保证煤心采取率达到百分之八十五以上，这实在是极其优异的成就。
    打斜眼是苏联在钻探事业上的重大贡献，它在技术上、经济上都具有重大价值和意义。书中也介绍了鸡西钻探公司试行这个方法的一些成功经验。这正有力地证明了苏联先进经验的可贵和努力向苏联学习的重要。
    最后，这本书虽名为“怎样做好煤矿地质钻探工作”，但其内容并不限于煤矿地质方面。一切地质钻探工作都是有不少共同点的，因此，对于所有石油、有色金属、水电建设，甚至一般厂址的地质钻探工作者，这本书也有研究和参考的价值。
