    The Bright Future of the Asian People
    Today is the eighth anniversary of the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. Eight years ago, thanks to the great victory of the Soviet army over the Japanese aggressors in Northeast China and northern Korea, and thanks to the great victory of the heroic War of Resistance Against Japan by the Chinese people and the people of other countries, the Japanese fascists were forced to surrender unconditionally, thus ending World War II. As a result of this historic victory by the anti-fascist people of the world, major changes have taken place in the Asian and world situation. The founding of the People's Republic of China and the high tide of national liberation movements in other vast areas of Asia are direct results of this change, and this result has further fundamentally changed the Asian situation. Now, the victorious end of the Korean people's war against aggression marks a new development in the strength of the Asian people. The changes in the Asian situation over the past eight years have been enormous and great.
    After the end of World War II, American imperialism stole a large part of the fruits of the victory of the anti-fascist war, replacing Germany and Japan as the most疯狂的aggressor in the world. In Asia, after its intervention in the Chinese revolution failed miserably, it launched a war of aggression in Korea. In order to carry out the war of aggression against Korea, American imperialism not only mobilized one-third of its army, one-fifth of itsair force, and a large part of its navy, and turned the entire national economy into a wartime system, but also coerced fifteen countries to participate in the war of aggression against Korea. At the same time, while launching the war of aggression against Korea, the American aggressors occupied our Taiwan, openly interfered in the liberation wars of the Filipino and Vietnamese people, and tried to extend their aggressive forces to China's Southeast Asian neighbors by means of various threatening and enticing despicable means. However, now the rampant American imperialism has been defeated in its aggression against Korea, and its entire plan and steps to invade Asia and the world have been disrupted. The victory of the Chinese and Korean people is a major encouragement to the Asian people's struggle against aggression.
    The victory of the Chinese and Korean people in defeating American imperialist aggression is also beneficial to the struggle of the Japanese people. The development of the Asian situation is increasingly conducive to the Japanese people's struggle against the rule of the American occupiers and unfavorable to the American occupiers' rule over the Japanese people. The American occupiers and their running dogs, the Japanese reactionary ruling class, have used all kinds of deceptive means to cover up the dangerous future of dragging Japan into a new war disaster, and even blatantly want the Japanese people to believe that only rearmament and foreign expansion can lead to a way out. After the outbreak of the Korean War, the American occupiers stepped up the rearmament of Japan and expanded Japan's arms production to serve the American war of aggression against Korea; at the same time, it successively signed the San Francisco separate "peace treaty," the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty," the "U.S.-Japan Administrative Agreement," and the "U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation" with the Yoshida reactionary government, strangling Japan's national independence and economic rights like layers of ropes, placing Japan under long-term military occupation, economic monopoly, and political oppression by the United States, making it its colony and accomplice in aggression against Asia. At the same time, the American occupiers forced Japan to implement "blockade" and "embargo" against the People's Republic of China, cutting off the traditional trade relations between China and Japan; and encouraged Japan to expand into Southeast Asia, attempting to seize Britain's market in Southeast Asia by proxy. However, this is completely contrary to the interests of the Japanese people and their country. The United States is forcing Japan to take the road of militarist war, which is only a dead end. The Japanese people clearly see that now even a powerful imperialist country like the United States has run into a wall when it wants to take the old road of Japanese militarist aggression. The increasingly deepening national crisis and economic crisis that Japan has faced in recent years is enough to make all Japanese patriots urgently feel that the only way out is to further unite, strive for independence and freedom from the American occupiers, and strive to establish peaceful, friendly and trade relations with Asian countries.
    In their congratulatory message on the eighth anniversary of the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan to Chairman Malenkov of the Soviet Council of Ministers and Minister Molotov of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai said: "Recently, the signing of the Korean armistice agreement is obviously a new and major achievement of the entire peace and democracy camp in its efforts to strive for peace and prevent a new war. This new and major achievement has already helped to ease the overall world situation, and at the same time, it will also help the Japanese people's efforts to demand the establishment of normal relations with Far Eastern countries in order to prevent the resurgence of Japanese imperialist aggression."
    Public opinion in Asia and countries around the world believes that the realization of the Korean armistice must lead to peace throughout Asia and further seek to restore and enhance normal relations and economic ties between Asian countries, especially between Japan and other countries. Recently, the increasing upsurge of the movement among broad sections of the Japanese people demanding the promotion of Sino-Japanese friendship and Sino-Japanese trade has demonstrated their legitimate and urgent desire.
    However, the American imperialists, who obstruct and undermine the realization of this desire by the people of Asian countries, are not relaxing their policy of promoting aggressive war in Asia because they have once again suffered a blow from the forces of the Asian people in the Korean War; on the contrary, they are intensifying the creation of tension in Asia, engaging in frequent aggressive activities and new adventure preparations, attempting to salvage their doomed fate of defeat in Asia. Now people have seen many conclusive facts of this kind. The American aggressors and the Syngman Rhee clique are conspiring to sabotage the political conference and sign a military alliance in the so-called "mutual defense treaty"; not only that, the conspiratorial activities of American diplomats and generals in Tokyo, Taiwan, Saigon, and other regions have also become tense. Dulles, the most reactionary adventurer in the United States, is exerting pressure on the countries participating in the aggression against Korea, forcing them to continue to abandon their own national interests and submit to the so-called "common policy" of the United States to maintain hostility towards the People's Republic of China, and to assume part of the obligations of the United States to carry out new adventures in Korea and Vietnam, in order to drag them back into the water again. It must be pointed out that the United States is also implementing increasingly blatant intimidation and interference against many countries in Asia that are unwilling to accept the United States' enslaving "aid," do not agree with the United States' "Cold War" policy, and are willing to contribute more to promoting friendly cooperation between countries and the cause of world peace, in an attempt to make them submit, so as to facilitate the implementation of its aggressive policy.
    In the United States' future intensified new conspiratorial activities to invade Asia, intensifying the restoration of Japan's war hotbed is still the focus, and it is seen as more important than before. Because the United States has deeply felt its lack of strength in the Korean War, when it decided to "disengage" from the Korean battlefield, it hoisted the infamous banner of "Asians fight Asians," wanting to rely on rascals like Shigeru Yoshida, Syngman Rhee, Chiang Kai-shek, Quirino, Bao Dai, and Plaek Phibunsongkhram to realize its aggressive ambitions that it cannot achieve with its own strength; among them, the largest and most readily mobilized war bet that the United States considers to be, is the revival of Japanese militarist forces. Therefore, after the Korean armistice, the United States' activities to "aid" Japan in accelerating rearmament have also become tense. The negotiations on the disguised so-called "Mutual Security Assistance Agreement" have officially begun publicly; according to this agreement, the United States will use huge amounts of dollars to force Japan to accelerate the expansion of its armed forces and expand its war production. According to the "Five-Year Army, Navy, and Air Force Defense Plan" revealed by Tokutaro Kimura, director-general of the "Security Agency," Japan's disguised military department, Japan will expand the disguised army "Security Force" to 205,000 men, increase the warships of the "Maritime Safety Force" to 143,000 tons, and establish an air force with 1,530 aircraft, including 480 jet aircraft, within five years. This rearmament plan obviously cannot win the satisfaction of the American masters. Recently, after Dulles' visit to South Korea and Japan, he openly expressed dissatisfaction with the Japanese government's reluctance to expand its military arbitrarily due to the strong opposition of the domestic people. He demanded that Japan increase the "Security Force" to ten divisions through the budget, that is, to increase the existing 110,000 men to 350,000 men. The United States' intensified arming of Japan is the basis for realizing the United States' piecing together of the Pacific aggressive alliance, and therefore a serious threat to the peace and security of Asia and the Pacific region.
    Therefore, the current urgent task facing the people of Asia and Japan is to wage a resolute struggle against the U.S. imperialists' intensified arming of Japan, the organization of the Pacific aggressive alliance, and various conspiratorial activities to provoke new wars, and they must defeat it. No matter which country in Asia the people are from, even the people of Japan, which is occupied by the United States, their just struggle to defend peace and resist the forces of aggressive war has the broadest mass base in their own country and powerful allies abroad. They can completely achieve victory by continuously strengthening and expanding the great unity and common struggle of the people at home and abroad. What is particularly important is that the Soviet Union, which eliminated the main force of the Japanese fascist army eight years ago and促使Japanese imperialism to surrender, is now even stronger; the Chinese people, who heroically persisted in the War of Resistance Against Japan and defeated Japanese imperialism, and then achieved victory in the domestic liberation war, have now joined hands with the Korean people to inflict a heavy blow on the aggressive forces of American imperialism; and the two major powers, China and the Soviet Union, have long concluded an unbreakable friendly alliance to jointly prevent the re-aggression of Japan and any country that colludes with Japan in aggressive acts. This alliance has proven to be a reliable guarantee against the threat of new aggression and a strong bulwark of peace in Asia and the world.
    The united strength of the Asian people is infinitely powerful. Japan can never be enslaved for a long time, and the Japanese people will never allow their country to repeat the mistakes of militarism. The liberation struggle of the people of other Asian countries that are still suffering from imperialist rule and enslavement can certainly achieve final victory. The future of the Asian people is infinitely bright.

### 亚洲人民的光明前途

    亚洲人民的光明前途
    今天是抗日战争胜利日的八周年纪念。八年前，由于苏军在我国东北和朝鲜北部对日本侵略者的伟大胜利，由于中国人民和其他国家人民的英勇抗日战争的伟大胜利，迫使日本法西斯无条件投降，从而结束了第二次世界大战。由于世界反法西斯人民取得了这一历史性的胜利，亚洲和世界形势发生了重大的变化。中华人民共和国的成立，和亚洲其他广大地区民族解放运动的高涨，就是这一变化的直接结果，而这个结果又使亚洲形势进一步发生根本的改变。现在，朝鲜人民反侵略战争的胜利结束，标志着亚洲人民力量的新发展。八年来亚洲形势的变化，是巨大的，伟大的。
    第二次世界大战结束以后，美帝国主义窃取了反法西斯战争胜利的很大一部分果实，代替德国和日本成为世界上最疯狂的侵略者。在亚洲方面，它对中国革命的干涉可耻地失败后，又在朝鲜挑起了侵略战争。为了进行侵略朝鲜的战争，美帝国主义不仅动员了国内三分之一的陆军、五分之一的空军和一大部分海军，把全部国民经济转入战时体制，而且胁迫十五个国家参加了侵朝战争。同时，美国侵略者发动侵朝战争的同时，侵占了我国台湾，同时公开干涉菲律宾和越南人民的解放战争，并以种种威胁利诱的卑劣手段力图把侵略势力伸入到中国的东南亚邻国。但是，现在猖狂跋扈的美帝国主义在朝鲜的侵略被打败了，它的整个侵略亚洲和世界的计划和步骤被打乱了。中朝人民的胜利是对亚洲人民反侵略斗争的重大鼓舞。
    中朝人民战胜美帝国主义侵略的胜利，对日本人民的斗争也是有利的。亚洲形势的发展，日益有利于日本人民反抗美国占领者统治的斗争，而不利于美国占领者对日本人民的统治。美国占领者及其走狗日本反动统治阶级，曾使用一切欺骗手段，来掩盖它们把日本拖向新的战争灾祸的危险前途，并且还公然想叫日本人民相信只有重整军备和向外扩张才有出路。朝鲜战争爆发后，美国占领者加紧重新武装日本，扩大日本的军火生产为美国侵朝战争服务；同时它并与吉田反动政府先后签订了旧金山单独“和约”、“美日安全条约”、“美日行政协定”及“美日通商航海条约”，像一层层的绳索绞杀着日本的民族独立和经济权利，使日本处于美国的长期的军事占领、经济垄断和政治压迫之下，成为它的殖民地和侵略亚洲的帮凶。同时，美国占领者强迫日本对中华人民共和国实行“封锁”“禁运”，切断了中日两国的传统贸易关系；并鼓励日本向东南亚扩张，企图假手日本来夺取英国在东南亚的市场。但是，这是和日本人民及其国家的利益完全违背的，美国强迫日本走军国主义化的战争道路只是
    一条死路。日本人民清楚地看到，现在连美国这样强大的帝国主义国家想走日本军国主义的侵略老路也都碰壁了。日本近几年来所面临的民族危机和经济危机日益深刻的局势，已足够使日本所有爱国人士迫切地感到只有进一步团结起来，向美国占领者争取独立自由，争取与亚洲各国建立和平友好与贸易关系，才是唯一的出路。
    毛泽东主席和周恩来总理兼外长在抗日战争胜利八周年给苏联部长会议马林科夫主席和苏联外交部莫洛托夫部长的贺电说：“最近，朝鲜停战协定的签字，显然是整个和平民主阵营在争取和平、制止新战争的努力中所获得的新的重大的成就。这
    一新的重大的成就业已有助于整个世界形势的开始和缓，同时，也将有助于日本人民要求与远东各国建立正常关系的努力，以便防止日本帝国主义侵略之再起。”
    亚洲和世界各国人民的舆论认为：朝鲜停战的实现，必须引向全亚洲范围内的和平，引向进一步谋求恢复与增进亚洲各国特别是日本与各国之间的正常关系和经济联系。最近以来，日本广泛人士要求促进日中友好和日中贸易的运动的更加高涨，就是表现了他们的这个正当的迫切愿望。
    但是，阻挠和破坏亚洲各国人民实现这个愿望的美帝国主义者，并不因它在朝鲜战争中又一次遭受到亚洲人民力量的打击，而放松它在亚洲推行侵略战争的政策；相反地，它正在加紧制造亚洲的紧张局势，从事频繁的侵略活动和新的冒险准备，企图挽救它在亚洲注定了的失败命运。现在人们已经看到了不少这一类的确凿事实。美国侵略者与李承晚集团正在共谋破坏政治会议，并签订所谓“共同防御条约”的军事同盟；不仅这样，美国的外交家和将军们在东京、台湾、西贡以及其他地区的阴谋活动也紧张起来了。美国最反动的冒险分子杜勒斯向参加侵朝各国施行压力，强迫它们继续放弃自己的国家利益而屈从美国维持敌视中华人民共和国的所谓“共同政策”，并承担美国在朝鲜和越南进行新的冒险的一部分义务，以便把它们重新拖下水去。必须指出，美国对亚洲许多不愿接受美国奴役性的“援助”，不赞同美国的“冷战”政策，而愿意对促进各国友好合作及世界和平事业作更多贡献的国家，也正在实行日益露骨的恫吓和干涉，企图使它们屈服，以便利它的侵略政策的推行。
    在美国今后加紧进行侵略亚洲的新阴谋活动中，加紧恢复日本的战争温床，仍是它的重心所在，并且被看得比从前更为重要了。因为美国在朝鲜战争中更加深切地感到力不从心，当它决心从朝鲜战场“脱身”的时候，就打出了臭名远扬的“亚洲人打亚洲人”的旗子来，想依靠吉田茂、李承晚、蒋介石、季里诺、保大和銮披汝一类的亡命之徒，来替它实现它自己的力量所不能办到的侵略野心；其中被美国认为最大的和可能迅速动员的战争赌注，就是日本军国主义势力的复活。所以，朝鲜停战后，美国“援助”日本加速重新武装的活动也就紧张起来了。遮遮掩掩的所谓“共同安全援助协定”的谈判正式公开举行了；依照这个协定，美国将以巨额的美元强使日本加速扩充武装部队和扩大战争生产。据日本变相军部“保安厅”长官木村笃太郎所透露的“五年陆海空军防御计划”，日本将在五年内把变相陆军“保安队”扩充到二十万五千人，“海上警备队”的军舰增加到十四万三千吨，并建立一支拥有一千五百三十架飞机的空军，其中包括喷气式飞机四百八十架。这个重整军备的计划显然还不能博得美国主子的称心，最近杜勒斯由南朝鲜到日本一行之后，就对日本政府因慑于国内人民的强烈反对而不敢肆行扩军一点公开表示不满，他要求日本通过预算把“保安队”增加到十个师，即要把现有的十一万人增加到三十五万人。美国加紧武装日本是实现美国拼凑太平洋侵略联盟的基础，因而是对亚洲及太平洋区域和平与安全的严重威胁。
    因此，摆在亚洲和日本人民的当前迫切任务，是向美帝国主义加紧武装日本、组织太平洋侵略联盟、以及挑拨新战争的种种阴谋活动作坚决的斗争，并且必须击败它。不论是亚洲那一国家的人民，即使是被美国所占领的日本的人民，他们保卫和平、反抗侵略战争势力的正义斗争，都在他们的国内拥有最广泛的群众基础，在国外拥有强大的同盟军，他们是完全可以从不断加强和扩大国内外的人民的大团结和共同斗争中取得胜利的。特别重要的是，八年前消灭日本法西斯军队主力而促使日本帝国主义投降的苏联，现在更加强大了；曾经英勇地坚持战胜日本帝国主义的抗日战争并接着取得了国内解放战争胜利的中国人民，现在又与朝鲜人民一起给了美帝国主义的侵略势力以严重的打击；并且中苏两大强国之间早已为共同制止日本和其他在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的任何国家之重新侵略而缔结了牢不可破的友好同盟，这个同盟已经证明了是反对新侵略威胁的可靠保证，是亚洲和全世界和平的坚强堡垒。
    亚洲人民的团结力量是无限强大的。日本决不可能被长期奴役，日本人民也决不会允许他们的国家重蹈军国主义的覆辙，亚洲其他仍然遭受帝国主义统治和奴役的国家的人民的解放斗争一定可以取得最后胜利。亚洲人民的前途是无限光明的。
