Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 6th. The Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Army Prisoner of War Administration announces:

	The following is the text:

	By order of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army: The eleven members of the U.S. Far East Air Force's 91st Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron's No. 1727 RB-29 bomber crew, namely: Theodore R. Harris, Joseph E. Morlan, Francis A. Steube, Bernard F. Reaves, William E. Kausky, Edwin D. Comes, Kenneth E. Bassi, Charles V. Johnson, Eugene E. Ives, Donald L. Hand, and Kenneth H. Bass, were captured by our forces in July 1952. While in detention, Harris and the others confessed that the U.S. Air Force had carried out criminal activities such as invading the airspace of the People's Republic of China, dropping germ bombs in China, and airdropping special agents. Because Harris and the others were highly suspected of being involved in the above-mentioned activities, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea extradited Harris and the others to the People's Republic of China to be investigated by the Northeast People's Government of China. According to the results of the investigation, the Northeast People's Government of the People's Republic of China believes that Harris and the other eleven people are not directly related to the U.S. Air Force's aggressive activities in China, so it decided to exempt them from prosecution and has returned Harris and the other eleven people to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Accordingly, Harris and the other eleven people should be repatriated immediately in accordance with general prisoner of war repatriation procedures.

	In compliance with the above order, this Prisoner of War Administration has decided to repatriate all of the above-mentioned prisoners of war, Harris and the other eleven people, on September 5, 1953. This is hereby announced.

	Wang Yangong, Director of the Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Army Prisoner of War Administration
	September 5, 1953

    关于遣返美空军战俘哈立斯等的公告
    【新华社开城六日电】朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿军战俘管理处公告。文如下：
    奉朝鲜人民军总政治局命令：美国远东空军第九十一战略侦察中队一七二七号RB—29型轰炸机机组十一人，计为：狄奥多·R·哈立斯，约瑟夫·E·摩兰，佛朗西斯·A·斯吹贝，伯纳·F·瑞勿斯，威廉·E·考斯基，爱德文·D·柯木斯，坎尼斯·E·巴西，查理斯·V·约翰逊，尤金·E·伊伏斯，唐纳·L·汉德，肯尼斯·H·巴斯，于一九五二年七月被我俘获。在拘留中，该哈立斯等自承美国空军曾进行侵犯中华人民共和国领空，在中国投掷细菌弹并空投特务等罪恶活动。由于该哈立斯等在上述活动中涉有重大嫌疑，因此，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府将该哈立斯等引渡至中华人民共和国，交由中国东北人民政府进行考查。根据考查结果，中华人民共和国东北人民政府认为该哈立斯等十一人与美国空军在中国所进行的侵略活动尚无直接关系，故决定免予追究，并已将该哈立斯等十一人送还朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。据此，该哈立斯等十一人应即按照一般战俘遣返手续，予以遣返。
    遵奉上述命令，本战俘管理处定于一九五三年九月五日将上述战俘哈立斯等十一人予以全部遣返。特此公告。
    朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿军战俘管理处主任王央公
    一九五三年九月五日
