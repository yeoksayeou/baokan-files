The People's Daily published two articles on August 26th, "Correctly Treating the Chinese Medical Heritage" and "Some Opinions on the Research of Traditional Chinese Medicine." These two articles not only gave a relatively correct assessment of China's medical academic field, correcting some people's erroneous views on China's medical academic field, but also provided opinions on the future development direction of China's medical academic field.

China's medical academic field is the crystallization of our ancestors' medical experience. Although it has never formed a relatively systematic and complete scientific theory, we should never measure it by the words and deeds of quack doctors. Furthermore, we cannot underestimate its value in medical treatment, especially its role in China's current sanitary conditions, simply because China's medical academic field emphasizes experience and lacks scientific accuracy in clinical aspects. For thousands of years, China's medical academic field has indeed played a certain role in the health care of the Chinese people. The fact that many people are still willing to receive treatment from traditional Chinese medicine practitioners shows that traditional Chinese medicine can solve some problems for patients. Therefore, all the medical experience mastered by traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, whether direct or indirect, is worthy of attention and research.

In order to critically accept China's medical heritage and make China's medical academic field more effectively serve the people, in addition to agreeing with the original intentions of the above two articles, we would like to provide some supplementary opinions on some of the issues.

Improving the dosage forms of traditional Chinese medicine is an important task. Traditional Chinese medicine practitioners generally use traditional Chinese medicine based on experience. A traditional Chinese medicine often contains several components, and therefore has several therapeutic effects. Therefore, when improving the dosage forms of traditional Chinese medicine, if we only emphasize "purification," that is, extracting only one active ingredient from a drug and discarding other ingredients, this is scientific for some drugs, and we should put more effort into this aspect in the future. However, for other drugs, it is easy to reduce or even change its therapeutic effect, and this work should be studied more by experts and carried out cautiously. For example, peony, which is used by traditional Chinese medicine practitioners as a blood-harmonizing and pain-relieving agent, has been proven by chemical analysis to have benzoic acid as its main chemical component, so what is extracted is also benzoic acid. In this way, the refined peony becomes an expectorant, diuretic, and preservative, and its original blood-harmonizing and pain-relieving effect disappears. Therefore, the improvement of traditional Chinese medicine dosage forms should start from clinical practicality, closely combining chemical analysis, pharmacological research, and clinical practical application, and gradually improve on the basis of existing knowledge about traditional Chinese medicine. It is absolutely impossible to blindly take all traditional Chinese medicines for refining all at once, but we should choose those that we are sure of first; and try to make each preparation treat only one disease. Since traditional Chinese medicine practitioners often use compound prescriptions, the mixed use of several preparations should also be considered when improving the dosage forms of traditional Chinese medicine. Some people believe that changing the dosage form is a Westernization of traditional Chinese medicine and a formalistic approach; others say that traditional Chinese medicine is a compound prescription and cannot be changed, and once changed, it will lose or destroy the original effective ingredients and become ineffective, and cite some examples of failures in changing the dosage form to oppose changing the dosage form of traditional Chinese medicine. These views are incorrect and should be corrected.

Sorting out China's medical academic literature is an even more important initiative. There are many Chinese medical books and many medical methods. Taking Treatise on Febrile Diseases as an example, since Zhang Zhongjing of the Han Dynasty completed his work, after being annotated by Cheng Wuji, by the time Huang Yuanyu wrote "Explanation of Treatise on Febrile Diseases" in the Qing Dynasty, there were already two hundred and fifty-six schools. Among them, "Nanyang Living Person Book" written by Zhu Gong of the Song Dynasty is a masterpiece on the study of Treatise on Febrile Diseases. And Li Xianzhi's "Living Person Book Summary," Cheng Jiong's "Book Discrimination," Wang Zuosu's "Increased Interpretation," and Zhao Sizhen's "Explanation of Doubts" in the late Yuan Dynasty are also very worthy of study. There are also more than two hundred kinds of monographs specializing in the study of the properties of Chinese medicines recorded in classics. Among them, Tang Shenwei's "Zheng Lei Materia Medica" of the Song Dynasty is a famous masterpiece of pharmacology. In terms of versions, it has the Daguan edition of Daguan two years in the Song Dynasty, the newly revised edition of Zhenghe, the collated edition of Shaoxing in the Southern Song Dynasty, and the complete edition of Dade in the Yuan Dynasty. In terms of the content of Materia Medica: there are "Hai Yao Materia Medica," "Hu Materia Medica," etc., which record the origin of drugs; there are "Diet Therapy Materia Medica," "Food Mirror Materia Medica," etc., which discuss diet hygiene (commonly known as food therapy); there are "Carbuncle Ear and Eye Materia Medica," "Pediatric Medication Materia Medica," etc., which discuss specialist treatment. Li Shizhen's "Compendium of Materia Medica" in the Ming Dynasty can be said to be the culmination of Materia Medica. In addition, there are Pu Xian'an's "Reading Materia Medica Fast Compilation," Zhao Xuemin's "Supplement" in the Qing Dynasty, etc., and there are also a considerable number of effective herbs and herbs to be collected that are not included in the outline. Therefore, medical literature such as Chinese medicine prescriptions and Materia Medica also needs to be studied and sorted out in a focused manner with a certain amount of manpower.

The purpose of critically accepting China's medical heritage is to make China's medical academic field better serve the people. To this end, we must also use the viewpoint and method of dialectical materialism to strengthen the research work of China's medical history. No matter which science is studied, it is impossible to leave its own history. If you lose history, you cannot find its evolutionary law. Those who study politics must study political history, those who study literature must study literary history, and those who study medicine must study medical history, especially to understand the medical history of their own country. Only through rich medical historical materials can we more deeply understand the basis on which China's medical academic field arose and developed, better understand the characteristics and current situation of China's medical academic field, and more clearly understand the future development path of China's medical academic field.

Critically accepting China's medical heritage is an extremely meticulous and extremely complex task. This task cannot be completed by a few medical experts and a few traditional Chinese medicine practitioners alone. It must rely on the cooperation of a large number of experienced traditional Chinese medicine practitioners and many medical experts. Therefore, we believe that to do this work well, in addition to sincerely and closely cooperating with medical experts, traditional Chinese medicine practitioners should also eliminate sectarianism, conservative thinking, and sincerely exchange experience and discuss medical theories. We believe that most traditional Chinese medicine practitioners are willing to put aside their prejudices and work hard under the leadership of the People's Government to complete this great historical task.

Editor's note: The author of this article, Xiao Longyou, is a famous traditional Chinese medicine practitioner in Beijing, and Zhao Shuping is the director of the Beijing Association of Traditional Chinese Medicine.

    对批判地接受我国医学遗产的意见
    萧龙友  赵树屏
    八月二十六日人民日报发表了“正确地对待中国医学遗产”和“我对于中药研究工作的几点意见”两篇文章。这两篇文章不仅给我国医药学术作了比较正确的估价，矫正了一部分人对我国医药学术的错误观点，并且提供了关于我国医药学术今后发展方向的意见。
    我国医药学术是我们祖先医疗经验的结晶。虽然它一直没有形成比较系统的完整的科学理论，但我们决不应当以江湖医士的言行来衡量它，更不能因为我国医药学术偏重经验，在临床方面还缺乏科学的准确性，便过低地估计它在医疗上的价值，特别在我国目前卫生条件下的作用。几千年来，我国医药学术在我国人民的保健事业上，确实起了一定的作用。现在，许多人仍愿意接受中医师的治疗，正说明中医中药能给病人解决一些问题。所以，为中医师所掌握的一切医疗经验，无论是直接的经验或是间接的经验，都是值得重视和加以研究整理的。
    为了批判地接受我国医学遗产，使我国医药学术更有效地为人民服务，我们除了同意上述两篇文章的原意外，这里想就其中的若干问题提供一些补充意见。
    改进中药剂型是一项重要的工作。中医师一般是凭经验使用中药的。一种中药多半含有数成分，也就有数种治疗功效。因此在改进中药剂型时，如果单单强调“提纯”，即从一种药物中只提出一种有效成分，而抛弃其它成分，这对某些药物来说是科学的，今后我们应该在这方面多下工夫。但是对于另外一些药物来说，就容易减少甚至改变了它的治疗功效，这项工作就应该多请专家研究，审慎进行。譬如中医师用作和血止痛剂的芍药，经过化学分析证明它的主要化学成分是安息香酸，因而提炼出的也是安息香酸。这样，提炼后的芍药就变成了清痰利水和防腐剂，它原有的和血止痛的药效消失了。因此改进中药剂型，应当是从临床实用出发，把化学分析和药理研究以及临床实际应用密切地结合起来，在现有的关于中药知识的基础上逐步改进。切不可盲目地把所有的中药一下子都拿来提制，而应当挑选确有把握的先做；并尽可能地使每一种制剂单独治疗一种病症。由于中医师用药常常使用复合方剂，所以在改进中药剂型时，也应当考虑到几种制剂的混合使用。有的人认为改变剂型是中药西药化，是一种形式主义的作法；也有人说中药是复合方剂，不可以改变，一经改变，就会把原有的有效成分丧失或破坏而变为无效，并举出一些改变剂型中的失败的例子用来反对改变中药剂型。这些看法都是不对的，应当纠正的。
    整理我国医药学术文献更是一个重要的倡议。我国的医药书籍很多，医疗方法也很多。就以伤寒论来说，自汉代张仲景完成他的著作以后，中经成无已注解，到清代黄元御著“伤寒说意”时，已经有二百五十六家。其中如宋代朱肱著的“南阳活人书”，就是研究伤寒论的巨著。而李先知的“活人书括”、程逈的“书辨”、王作肃的“增释”、元末赵嗣贞的“释疑”等也都是很值得研究的文献。研究中国药物性能的专门论著，载在典籍的也有二百多种。其中如宋代唐慎微的“证类本草”就是有名的药物学的巨著。以版本而论，它有宋代大观二年的大观本，有政和的新修本，有南宋绍兴的校订本，有元代大德的大全本。就本草内容来说：记载药物产地的有“海药本草”、“胡本草”等；讨论饮食卫生（俗称食治）的有“食疗本草”、“食鉴本草”等；讨论专科治疗的有“痈疽耳眼本草”、“小儿用药本草”等。明代李时珍的“本草纲目”可谓集本草之大成。此外还有浦夕庵的“读本草快编”、清代赵学敏的“拾遗”等，其未列入纲目的有效草药和待采集使用的为数也不少。所以中医方论、本草等医学文献也是需要用一定的人力，有重点地进行研究整理的。
    批判地接受我国医学遗产的目的，是使我国医药学术更好地为人民服务。为此，还必须运用辩证唯物主义的观点和方法，加强我国医学史的研究工作。无论研究那一门科学，都不可能离开它自己的历史。丢开了历史便寻不出它演进的规律。学政治的要研究政治史，学文学的要研究文学史，学医的当然要研究医学史，尤其是要明了本国的医学史。只有透过丰富的医学史料，才能更深切地了解我国医药学术是在什么样的基础上发生和发展起来的，才能更好地了解我国医药学术的特点和现状，才能更清楚地认识我国医药学术的未来的发展道路。
    批判地接受我国医学遗产是一件极为细致极为复杂的工作。这件工作决不是少数医学专家和少数中医师所能完成的，它必须依靠广大有经验的中医师和许多医学专家合作。因此，我们认为要做好这件工作，中医师除了要真诚地和医学专家密切合作外，并且应当消除宗派主义、保守思想，诚心诚意地交流经验、研讨医学理论。我们相信大部分中医师是愿意抛开成见，在人民政府的领导下努力来完成这一伟大历史任务的。
