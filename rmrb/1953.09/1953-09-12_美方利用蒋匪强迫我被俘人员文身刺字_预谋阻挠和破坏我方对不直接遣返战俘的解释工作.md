Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 11th -- News from the POW camps in South Korea detaining non-directly repatriated prisoners of war states: In the month and more since the ceasefire, the US side, utilizing Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents, has once again forced non-directly repatriated captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to tattoo their bodies. Their aim is to increase their doubts, making them afraid to demand repatriation, in order to achieve the goal of forcibly detaining them and coercing them to go to Taiwan to serve as cannon fodder for the Chiang Kai-shek bandits.

According to reports, many non-directly repatriated Volunteer Army prisoners of war have their entire bodies tattooed with colorful patterns. Their entire chest and abdomen are tattooed with a flag of the Chiang Kai-shek gang, with the flagpole stretching from the left collarbone to the right waist; the back bears the Kuomintang party emblem of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and the arms and thighs are also covered with reactionary phrases insulting the new China. The Chiang Kai-shek secret agents forced the prisoners of war to strip naked, then tied their hands and feet, and used a two-inch-long needle to prick these flags and words one by one. It takes three to four hours to tattoo one person, and US military police are always present to supervise. More than eighty prisoners of war have been arrested by the US side for refusing to be tattooed, and their whereabouts are unknown; one prisoner of war has already been killed. This new crime by the US side began on August 10 and was completed in early September. The captured personnel have been weeping day and night since being tattooed.

At the same time, Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents have also repeatedly forced prisoners of war to cut their fingers and sign "petitions" to Chiang Kai-shek in blood, writing down their home addresses. The agents also threatened the prisoners of war, saying: "These blood letters have been sent to Taiwan. Even if the Communist Party doesn't kill you after you return to the mainland, the Kuomintang will kill your whole family when they counterattack the mainland in the future!"

Another noteworthy piece of news is that Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents obtained detailed maps of the camps in the southern half of the demilitarized zone where Indian troops were guarding non-directly repatriated prisoners of war from the US prisoner-of-war camp authorities long ago, which marked the locations of the barracks and the deployment positions of the Indian troops. After obtaining this map, the agents held many secret meetings. In addition, Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents gave the prisoners of war fourteen hours of lessons every day, proposing various means of sabotaging the explanation work, forcing the prisoners of war to discuss what to do in the future, and expressing that if something went wrong, they would have the "support of the United Nations forces." The agents have even forced the prisoners of war to conduct several exercises on their plots to obstruct and sabotage our explanation work.

    美方利用蒋匪强迫我被俘人员文身刺字
    预谋阻挠和破坏我方对不直接遣返战俘的解释工作
     【新华社开城十一日电】据来自南朝鲜拘留不直接遣返战俘的战俘营的消息说：美方利用蒋匪特务，在停战后的一个多月中，再度强迫不直接遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员文身刺字，其目的是要增加他们的疑虑，使他们不敢要求遣返，以达到强迫扣留他们，胁迫他们到台湾去为蒋匪充当炮灰的目的。
    据消息说，许多不直接遣返的志愿军被俘人员全身都被刺得花花绿绿。他们的整个胸部和腹部被刺上了一面蒋匪帮的旗子，旗杆自左胸锁骨一直伸到右侧腰部；背上是蒋匪国民党的党徽，两臂和大腿也刺满了侮辱新中国的反动字句。蒋匪特务强迫战俘们脱光衣服，然后绑住他们的手脚，用一根二寸长的针一针一针地刺上了这些旗和字。刺一个人需三、四小时，美国宪兵始终在场监督。有八十多名战俘因为拒绝刺字，被美方抓去，下落不明；有一名战俘已被杀死。美方这项新的罪行自八月十日开始，到九月初才完成。被俘人员被刺后日夜恸哭不止。
    同时，蒋匪特务还曾屡次强迫战俘割破手指，用血在给蒋匪的“请愿书”上签名，写下家庭地址。特务们并恐吓战俘说：“这些血书已经送到台湾去了，你们回大陆后即使共产党不杀你们，将来国民党反攻大陆就要杀你们全家！”
    另一个值得注意的消息是：蒋匪特务很早就从美方战俘营当局处得到了印度部队在非军事区南半部看管不直接遣返战俘的营地详图，其中标明了营房位置、印度部队的布防位置等。在得到这张图以后，特务们曾开过许多次秘密会议。此外，蒋匪特务们每天都给战俘上十四个小时的课，提出种种破坏解释工作的手段，强迫战俘讨论将来如何做，并表示出了乱子有“联合国军支持”。特务们甚至已就他们阻挠和破坏我方解释工作的预谋，强迫战俘作了几次演习。
