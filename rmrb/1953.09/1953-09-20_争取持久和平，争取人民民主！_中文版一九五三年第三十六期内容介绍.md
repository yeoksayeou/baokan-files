    The Chinese edition of the organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" 1953, Issue 36, has been published.
    The central content of this issue is about the issue of collective leadership in the Party. This issue publishes an editorial entitled "Collectivity is the Highest Principle of Leadership for Communist and Workers' Parties." The editorial points out: Collective leadership is the highest principle of leadership for Communist and Workers' Parties. The strength of the Party's leadership lies in its collectivity, unity, and consistency. Personality cults, which are contrary to collective leadership, will reduce the role of the Party and its leadership core and weaken the enthusiasm of Party members and the working people. Only when the entire Party, from top to bottom, collectively discusses and decides on issues based on extensive self-criticism and criticism from below, is it possible to promptly expose and eliminate shortcomings in work and distortions of the Party's line, and to promptly expose the conspiracies of the Party's enemies. The editorial also states: Collective leadership is an important prerequisite for correctly cultivating and educating new cadres, and an important prerequisite for effectively supervising the activities of elected organs and giving play to the initiative and activism of Party members.
    This issue also publishes an article by Rajk, member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party, entitled "The Question of Collective Leadership in the Hungarian Working People's Party." The article narrates the situation revealed by the June Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party regarding the shortcomings existing in the implementation of collective leadership, pointing out that in most cases, collective leadership has been replaced by individual leadership, both in the Party's higher leading organs and lower leading organs. These situations made it impossible for Party resolutions to be collectively formulated with the participation of all members of the Party's leading organs, weakened open, bold, and honest criticism, weakened the Party's connection with the masses, hindered the development of the working people's creativity, led to a decline in the activism of Party members, and made it difficult for the Party leadership to promptly expose and correct errors committed in economic policy. The article also discussed the measures taken by the Central Plenary Session to eliminate these shortcomings and errors, and pointed out that these measures have now produced good results.
    Important articles published in this issue also include: Deng Xiaoping, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, "The General Election of People's Congresses at All Levels in China," and Marcel Servin, member of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, "The Great Struggle of the French Working People."
    Marcel Servin's article narrates the unprecedentedly high wave of strikes in France this August, pointing out that the number of working people participating in this strike has greatly increased, and the strike movement has a clear breadth and spirit of unity, which has greatly frustrated the French government's conspiracy to implement anti-labor policies and undermine democratic rights. The article emphasizes: The large-scale August strike movement confirmed the correctness of the Party's line and the Party's assessment of the current situation, and confirmed Maurice Thorez's speech at the Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee in June: "In France, the nation's 'latent forces' are beginning to rise, and this force will determine a new course of development."

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五三年第三十六期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五三年第三十六期中文版已经出版。
    本期的中心内容是关于党的集体领导问题。本期以“集体性是共产党和工人党领导的最高原则”为题发表社论。社论指出：集体领导是共产党和工人党领导的最高原则。党的领导力量就在于它的集体性、团结和一致性。而与集体领导相违背的个人崇拜，会降低党及其领导核心的作用，并削弱党员群众和劳动人民的积极性。只有当全党自上而下以广泛的自我批评和自下而上的批评为基础，集体地讨论和决定问题时，才有可能及时地揭露和消灭工作中的缺点以及歪曲党的路线的情事，才有可能及时地揭露党的敌人的阴谋诡计。社论又说：集体领导是正确地培养和教育新干部的重要先决条件，是有效地监督由选举产生的机关的活动、发挥党员的积极性和主动性的重要先决条件。
    本期并刊载了匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会政治局委员和书记处书记拉约希·阿契的一篇文章，题目是“匈牙利劳动人民党的集体领导问题”。文章叙述了匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会六月全体会议揭发在实行集体领导方面所存在的缺点的情况，指出不论在党的上级领导机关和下级领导机关中，集体领导在大多数情况下都被个人领导所代替了。这些情况使得党的决议不能在党的领导机关全体成员的参加下集体地制定出来，削弱了公开和大胆而诚实的批评，削弱了党和群众的联系，阻碍了劳动人民创造力的发挥，造成了党员积极性的低落，并使党的领导很难及时地揭露和纠正在经济政策方面所犯的错误。文章还谈到了中央全会关于消灭这些缺点和错误所采取的措施，并指出这些措施现在已经产生了良好的结果。
    本期刊载的重要文章还有：中国共产党中央委员会委员邓小平的“中国各级人民代表大会的普选”，和法国共产党中央委员马赛尔·赛尔文的“法国劳动人民的伟大斗争”。
    马·赛尔文的文章叙述了今年八月法国罢工浪潮空前高涨的情形，指出参加这次罢工的劳动人民大为增加，罢工运动具有明显的广泛性和团结精神，它大大地挫败了法国政府实行反劳工政策和破坏民主权利的阴谋。文章强调说：大规模的八月罢工运动证实了党的路线、党对目前局势的估计的正确性，证实了莫·多列士六月间在党中央委员会全体会议上的讲话：“在法国，民族的‘潜在力量’正开始兴起，这种力量将决定新的发展过程。”
