The factories and mines under the Central Fuel Industry Department have universally launched a production increase and economy practice campaign, and have already achieved initial results. In order to make the production increase and economy practice campaign advance victoriously, recently Minister Chen Yu of the Ministry and responsible cadres from bureaus, departments, and sections have gone to major regions and key factories and mines to assist in the work.

After the Central Fuel Industry Department mobilized for production increase and economy practice at the joint meeting of directors of various professional management bureaus, major regional management bureaus, and chairmen of major regional trade unions on September 8, each professional management bureau immediately made specific arrangements according to the specific conditions of their departments. The coal mining industry requires that while mobilizing the masses to carry out propaganda and education on production increase and economy practice, it must emphasize guaranteeing safety and improving quality, as well as strengthening tunneling work, and that vigorously promoting advanced experience and launching movements to find tricks, tap potential, and make rationalization proposals be the basic methods. The electric power industry should carry out safe power transmission competitions and do a good job in the maintenance of important equipment to ensure the safe use of electricity for important industrial and mining production; and vigorously tap the potential of the power industry by increasing output, adjusting load, and unifying maintenance work. The petroleum industry should overcome the shortcomings of poor production operations and low refining rates, and reduce the waste of raw materials. Many factories and mines have been able to focus on reducing raw material consumption and factory and mine management costs in order to reduce production costs. Some factories and mines have paid more attention to handling stagnant equipment and strengthening the recovery and utilization of old and waste products.

Under the direct leadership of local party committees and governments, all major factories and mines in the fuel industry system have actively taken action and extensively carried out production increase and economy practice campaigns. Many factories and mines have guaranteed that the production increase and economy practice targets they will complete are higher than those stipulated by higher authorities. For example, the Coal Mine Management Bureau required the Northeast region to increase raw coal production by 300,000 tons and save 62.8 billion yuan, but Fushun Mine alone guaranteed to increase raw coal production by 400,000 tons and save 115 billion yuan; it required the North China region to save 52 billion yuan, but Kailuan Mine alone guaranteed to save 50 billion yuan. The Petroleum General Bureau required the Yumen Oil Mine Bureau to increase production and practice economy by 25.5 billion yuan, but the bureau guaranteed to complete 45 billion yuan; it required the Northeast Petroleum System to increase production and practice economy by 61 billion yuan, but after discussions among cadres, Petroleum Plant No. 1 could strive to complete 75 billion yuan, and after discussions among workers, it guaranteed to complete 90 billion yuan, and strive to complete 100 billion yuan. After discussions among employees, Petroleum Plant No. 7 could strive to complete 228 billion yuan and guarantee to turn over profits of 157 billion yuan. The production increase and economy practice plans of these two factories alone greatly exceeded the requirements of the higher authorities.

Facts have proved that there is a lot of potential for production increase and economy practice in the fuel industry system. For example, after adjusting the load, saving electricity, unifying scheduling, and unifying maintenance work, the electric power industry can tap the equivalent of 10 percent of the national existing equipment's potential. For example, the transformer capacity installed on the lines of the Beijing Electric Power Bureau is much larger than the city's total load, which results in significant electricity losses, and some are unsafe due to disrepair over the years. With only a slight adjustment, the country could save more than 3 billion yuan.

Judging from the production figures of the main products of the fuel industry system, the figures for mid-September were much higher than those for early September: coal increased by 7.2 percent, electricity increased by 29 percent, and gasoline increased by 61 percent. The safety situation has also improved. This shows that the production increase and economy practice campaign has achieved initial results. In the competition, many factories and mines can take improving business management as the central content, tap potential, and achieve the requirements of increasing production and practicing economy. A prominent example is Petroleum Plant No. 1 launching a daily progress competition. The goals of the competition are: to ensure the comprehensive and balanced completion of the plan on a daily, ten-day, and monthly basis under the conditions of safety and guaranteed quality. The conditions of the competition are: (1) Guarantee the completion of daily output; (2) Quality must meet national standards and be qualified daily; (3) Safety should focus on eliminating personal accidents; (4) The attendance rate should focus on eliminating absenteeism, requiring a ten-day attendance rate of 98 percent. Since the launch of the daily progress competition, the level of enterprise management has been improved, enabling the implementation of work plans, thus breaking the unbalanced production situation.

At present, although the production increase and economy practice campaign in the fuel industry system has been widely launched and has achieved many results, the development is not balanced. The phenomenon of only focusing on production increase and neglecting economy practice is quite common. The production increase and economy practice plans of some units are not specific, comprehensive, and practical enough, and the production increase and economy practice of some units still remains among the cadres. The reasons are: (1) Some cadres have insufficient understanding of the significance of production increase and economy practice, and still have the negative attitude of "production increase and economy practice are carried out every year, and now the higher authorities are calling for it again." These cadres do not understand that production increase and economy practice are the fundamental policy for developing socialist enterprises. (2) Some cadres do not have enough knowledge of the specific situation of the enterprise, especially about the key and weak links of their units, so they do not know where the potential lies. In addition, some cadres have some muddled ideas, advocating "keeping half," thus producing conservative ideas and failing to break through the old quotas based on new and advanced factors. (3) Some comrades mistakenly believe that engaging in economy practice has no "profits," and only rely on the financial department to deduct figures in isolation. They do not think about improving equipment utilization, improving labor organization, improving operating methods, and reducing product waste. (4) The grasp and implementation of the production increase and economy practice policy are not stable, and the phenomena of only focusing on rush work, not paying attention to preparation, and disregarding safety still exist. (5) Relying on the masses and contacting the masses are insufficient, and the systematic policy education of the masses is neglected. More commonly, the education and mobilization of technical personnel are very poor. (6) Production increase and economy practice are opposed to planning management. It is not understood that only by further improving management work can the production increase and economy practice campaign be guaranteed and carried out regularly, deeply, and persistently.

In order to correct these unhealthy phenomena and enable the production increase and economy practice campaign to be further developed, Chen Yu, Minister of the Central Fuel Industry Department, has, together with Song Zhichun, Deputy Director of the Coal Mine Management Bureau, and directors and chiefs of the department and various professional management bureaus, as well as engineering and technical personnel, gone to major regions and key factories and mines to lead and promote the normal progress of the production increase and economy practice campaign. In the future, the department will strengthen inspection work in order to timely correct the deviations occurring in production increase and economy practice and ensure the victorious completion and overfulfillment of the production increase and economy practice plan.

    燃料工业系统结合中心工作展开增产节约竞赛
    许多厂矿纷纷突破原定指标
    陈郁部长等深入重点单位检查工作
    中央燃料工业部所属各厂矿普遍展开了增产节约竞赛，并已取得初步成绩。为使增产节约竞赛胜利前进，最近该部陈郁部长和局、司、处负责干部多人分赴各大区、重点厂矿协助工作。
    中央燃料工业部在九月八日各专业管理总局、各大区管理局局长及大区工会主席的联席会议上，动员开展增产节约以后，各专业管理总局随即根据本部门的具体情况，分别作了具体布置。煤矿工业要求在发动群众进行增产节约宣传教育的同时，必须强调保证安全和提高质量，以及加强掘进工作，而以大力推广先进经验和展开找窍门、挖潜力、合理化建议运动为基本方法。电力工业以开展安全送电的竞赛，做好重要设备检修，来确保重要工矿生产的安全用电；以提高出力、调整负荷及统一检修工作来大力挖掘电业潜在能力。石油工业要克服生产操作不良、炼率低的缺点，减少原料的浪费。不少厂矿已能抓紧原材料消耗和厂矿管理费用的降低，以求降低生产成本。有些厂矿更注意处理呆滞器材与加强旧、废品的回收和利用等。
    在地方党委和政府直接领导下，燃料工业系统各个主要厂矿都已积极行动起来，广泛地开展了增产节约竞赛。不少厂矿保证完成的增产节约指标，比上级规定的还要高。例如煤矿管理总局要求东北区增产原煤三十万吨，节约六百二十八亿元，仅抚顺一个矿即保证增产原煤四十万吨，节约一千一百五十亿元；要求华北区节约五百二十亿元，仅开滦矿即保证节约五百亿元。石油总局要求玉门油矿局增产节约二百五十五亿元，但该局却保证完成四百五十亿元；要求东北石油系统增产节约六百一十亿元，石油一厂经干部讨论可争取完成七百五十亿元，再经工人讨论保证完成九百亿元，争取完成一千亿元。石油七厂经职工讨论后可争取完成两千二百八十亿元，保证上缴利润一千五百七十亿元。仅这两个厂子的增产节约计划，就大大地超过了上级的要求。
    事实证明，燃料工业系统在增产和节约方面，是存在着不少潜在力量的。例如电力工业经过调整负荷、节约用电、统一调度和统一检修等项工作，就可挖出相当于全国现有设备百分之十的潜力。又例如北京电业局现在线路上装的变压器容量比全市总负荷多得多，这样电的损失既大，有的年久失修也不安全，只要稍加调整，就可为国家节省三十多亿元。
    从燃料工业系统主要产品生产数字上看，九月中旬都高过上旬很多：煤提高了百分之七点二，电提高了百分之二十九，汽油提高了百分之六十一。安全情况也见好转。这说明开展增产节约竞赛已取得初步成绩。在竞赛中，不少厂矿能以改善经营管理为中心内容，发掘潜力，达到增产节约的要求。突出的例子如石油一厂开展了日进度竞赛。竞赛的目标是：在安全与保证质量的条件下，保证全面的、均衡的按日、按旬、按月完成计划。竞赛条件为：
  （一）保证完成每日产量；（二）质量以国家要求的规格为标准，必须按日合格；（三）安全以消灭人身事故为主；（四）出勤率以消灭旷工为主，要求每旬出勤率达到百分之九十八。日进度竞赛开展以来，提高了企业管理水平，使作业计划得以实现，因而打破了生产不均衡的局面。
    目前燃料工业系统的增产节约竞赛虽已广泛展开，并已获得不少成绩，但发展并不平衡，只注重增产忽视节约的现象相当普遍，有的单位增产节约计划不够具体、全面和切实，还有些单位增产节约尚停留在干部当中。其原因是：（一）有些干部对增产节约的意义认识不足，还存在着“增产节约年年搞，现在上级又号召”的消极态度。这些干部不了解增产节约是发展社会主义企业的根本方针。
  （二）有些干部对企业具体情况掌握不够，尤其对本单位的关键和薄弱环节心中无数，因此不知道潜力所在，更加上有些干部存在一些糊涂观念，主张
  “留一半”，因此产生了保守思想，不能根据新的与先进因素突破旧的定额。（三）有些同志错误地认为搞节约无“油水”，在节约上仅交财务部门孤立地扣数字，不知从改进设备利用、改进劳动组织、改进操作方法、减少产品废料等各方面着想。（四）对增产节约的政策掌握和贯彻的不稳，只顾突击，不注意做好准备工作和不顾安全的现象依然存在。
  （五）依靠群众，联系群众不够，忽视对群众进行系统的政策教育，更较普遍的是对技职人员教育和动员很差。（六）将增产节约与计划管理对立起来，不了解只有管理工作进一步改进，才能使增产节约竞赛得到保证并经常深入与持久的进行。
    为了纠正这些不健康的现象，使增产节约竞赛能够进一步开展，中央燃料工业部陈郁部长已偕同煤矿管理总局宋之春副局长及部与各专业管理总局司、处长和工程技术人员多人，分别前往各大区、各重点厂矿领导与推动增产节约竞赛的正常进展。今后该部将加强检查工作，以便及时纠正增产节约中发生的偏向，保证胜利地完成和超额完成增产节约计划。
