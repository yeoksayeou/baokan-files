    Ulbricht Discusses the Achievements of East Germany in Implementing the New Policy
    Points out that the Material Living Standards of People of All Classes Have Improved
    [Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 11th] According to a TASS report from Berlin on the 10th, "Neues Deutschland" published an article by Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, entitled "What Has the New Policy Brought?"
    Ulbricht wrote: Every citizen of the German Democratic Republic can see how much the German Democratic Republic has achieved in the three months since the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the Government of the German Democratic Republic decided to implement a new policy to improve the living standards of people of all classes. Ulbricht pointed out that due to the achievements of workers and peasants, and especially due to the selfless assistance provided by the socialist Soviet Union, it has become possible to improve supplies to residents. Ulbricht cited many materials to illustrate the improvement in the material living standards of the Republic's residents. Grain and daily consumer goods are increasing greatly. Comparing the second quarter of 1953 with the first quarter of the same year, meat imports increased by 270 percent; cotton fabrics increased by 166 percent. In the second half of 1953, the commodity circulation volume of the German Democratic Republic will increase by 30 percent compared to the first quarter of this year. The wages of workers in some departments have been increased, and prices have begun to fall. From the beginning of the implementation of the new policy to the present, the government has allocated 533.8 million marks to reduce the prices of several commodities. The supply of oils and margarine has increased. Sales of margarine in the second half of this year will increase by 50 percent compared to the first half of the year. During this period, farmers, handicraftsmen and small business operators received great help from the state. The government has allocated an additional 600 million marks to expand housing construction.

    乌布利希论述民主德国执行新方针的成就
    指出各阶层人民的物质生活水平已经提高
   【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社柏林十日讯：“新德意志报”刊载了德国统一社会党第一书记乌布利希的一篇题为“新方针带来了什么？”的文章。
    乌布利希写道：德意志民主共和国的每一个公民都可以看到，自从德国统一社会党中央委员会和德意志民主共和国政府决定执行改善各阶层人民生活水平的新方针以来，在三个月中，德意志民主共和国取得了多么大的成就。乌布利希指出：由于工人和农民的成就，特别是由于社会主义苏联所给予的无私援助，使得有可能改善对居民的供应。乌布利希举出许多材料说明共和国居民物质生活水平的提高。粮食和日用消费品正在大大增加。以一九五三年第二季度与同年第一季度比较，肉类进口增加到百分之二百七十；棉织品增加到百分之一百六十六。一九五三年下半年，德意志民主共和国的商品流通量将比今年第一季度提高百分之三十。某些部门工人工资已经提高，物价开始降低。从开始实施新方针到目前为止，政府已经拨出了五亿三千三百八十万马克用来降低几种商品的价格。油类和人造牛油的供应量增加了。今年下半年人造牛油的销售量将比上半年增加百分之五十。在这个时期内，农民、手工业者和小企业经营者得到国家巨大的帮助。政府额外拨出了六亿马克以扩大住宅建筑。
