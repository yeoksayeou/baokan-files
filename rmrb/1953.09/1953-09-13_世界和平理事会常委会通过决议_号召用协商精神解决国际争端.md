Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 12th - TASS dispatch from Vienna on the 11th: The Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, meeting in Vienna, passed the following resolution on the 10th:

    The Standing Committee of the World Peace Council is meeting for the first time since the cessation of military action in Korea, and the meeting congratulates this victory for the cause of peace.

    The Standing Committee discussed the progress of the movement launched by the World Peace Council on June 20, 1953, which called on the peoples of all countries to demand that their governments consult and reach agreements. Public opinion's attitude toward this call proves that the World Peace Council has expressed the deep aspirations of mankind. Today, no politician in any country dares to openly oppose consultation.

    However, recent developments have made it the duty of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council to remind the people to be vigilant. The word "consultation" is often used to mask measures that oppose the peaceful settlement of international disputes. To propose preconditions and to try to force others to accept the form and content of consultations in advance is not the same as consultation. To conclude a separate agreement with Syngman Rhee, who refused to cease fire, before consulting on the Korean issue, and to exclude India from the political conference, and to demand agreement on the revival of German militarism before any consultation on the German issue, all of these are attempts to make agreement impossible.

    We call on the peoples of all countries to prevent the resumption of the Korean War under any pretext and to strive for the cessation of the war in Indochina. For the sake of peace, the acts of violence taken in Asia and Africa that violate the independence and security of many countries must be stopped. The peoples of all countries do not agree to turn Germany back into a hotbed of war, threatening all its neighbors, the German people themselves, and world peace.

    The peoples of all countries demand sincere consultation, and demand sincere efforts to reach agreements in all areas on the basis of decisions acceptable to all.

    They demand respect for the United Nations Charter and demand that the People's Republic of China occupy its rightful seat in the United Nations. They believe that it is impossible to solve important international problems and establish peace without the participation of China. Because of the terrible threat of the hydrogen bomb to mankind, all weapons of mass slaughter must be banned immediately.

    The unbearable and dangerous burden of military expenditure must be alleviated through international disarmament agreements. The time has come to restore trade between countries on the principle of equality for the mutual benefit of all countries and to rapidly improve everyone's lives. The time has come to restore cooperation between countries. New prospects must be opened up for mankind.

    The Standing Committee of the World Peace Council confidently appeals to the peoples of all countries who have achieved a ceasefire in Korea, calling on them to unite and work together to defeat the policy of strength and enable agreements between governments to be realized.

    世界和平理事会常委会通过决议
    号召用协商精神解决国际争端
    【新华社十二日讯】塔斯社维也纳十一日讯：在维也纳举行的世界和平理事会常务委员会会议，十日通过一项决议如下：
    世界和平理事会常务委员会在朝鲜停止军事行动以后第一次举行会议，会议祝贺和平事业的这次胜利。
    常务委员会讨论了世界和平理事会于一九五三年六月二十日发起的运动的进展情况，这个运动号召各国人民要求他们的政府进行协商并达成协议。舆论对这个号召的态度证明，世界和平理事会表达了人类的深切愿望。今天，已经没有一个国家的政治家敢于公开反对协商了。
    但是，最近事态的发展，使世界和平理事会常务委员会有责任提醒人民的警惕。“协商”这两个字常常被用来掩盖反对和平解决国际争端的措施。提出先决条件和事先就想强迫别人接受协商的形式和内容，这并不等于协商。在就朝鲜问题进行协商以前先和拒绝停战的李承晚单独缔结协定，并且排斥印度参加政治会议，在就德国问题进行任何协商以前先要求同意复活德国军国主义，所有这些都是想要使协议成为不可能。
    我们号召各国人民防止在任何藉口下恢复朝鲜战争，并争取停止印度支那战争。为了和平，必须停止在亚洲和非洲所采取的、违反许多国家独立和安全的暴力行动。各国人民不同意把德国重新变成战争的温床，使它的所有邻国、德国人民本身和世界和平受到威胁。
    各国人民要求真诚的协商，要求做出真诚的努力，以便在大家都可以接受的决定的基础上达成各方面的协议。
    他们要求遵守联合国宪章，要求中华人民共和国在联合国中占有应得的席位。他们认为：要解决重要的国际问题和建立和平，没有中国参加是不可能的。由于氢弹对人类的可怖的威胁，必须立刻禁止一切大规模屠杀的武器。
    令人不可忍受的和危险的军费重担，必须通过国际裁减军备协议予以减轻。为了各国的互利和迅速改善大家的生活，在平等的原则上恢复各国之间的贸易的时机已经到来了。恢复各国之间的合作的时机已经到来了。必须给人类打开新的远景。
    世界和平理事会常务委员会满怀信心地向已经使朝鲜获得停战的各国人民呼吁，号召他们团结起来，同心协力来挫败实力政策并使各国政府之间的协议得以实现。
