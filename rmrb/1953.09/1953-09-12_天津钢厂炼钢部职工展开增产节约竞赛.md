Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 11th: Workers in the steelmaking department of the state-owned Tianjin Steel Plant have launched a labor competition to strive for the comprehensive overfulfillment of this year's national production plan. The goals of the competition are to shorten steelmaking time, do a good job in furnace protection, reduce one intermediate repair within this year, and ensure continuous steelmaking for 400 heats. In September, the primary goals are: one open-hearth furnace should have ten heats of steelmaking within seven hours, and other open-hearth furnaces should have thirty heats of steelmaking within six hours.

Although Tianjin Steel Plant completed its total production value plan in the first half of the year, the quality reached the planned targets, and the actual cost was also 4.36% lower than planned, the output of steel ingots, the main product, only reached 97.69% of the plan. This was because the factory leadership did not pay enough attention to implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts, and the steelmaking time of open-hearth furnaces could not be shortened quickly. After inspecting this situation, the factory leadership and the workers of the steelmaking department formulated a specific plan to implement the suggestions of Soviet experts. By mid-August, with the help of Soviet experts, the steelmaking department workers repaired a certain open-hearth furnace 37 hours ahead of schedule, and also carried out work such as digging and repairing the furnace roof and front wall of other open-hearth furnaces. Then, the workers responded to the call of the factory leadership to smelt a heat of steel in an average of seven hours and fifteen minutes, and launched a labor competition. In the competition, workers and technicians implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts, and the smelting time of each heat of steel has gradually been shortened. Since September, the average smelting time of each open-hearth furnace has been shortened to seven hours and four minutes. The workers of the Sun Shifeng and Li Wanfu shifts have continuously created new records of five hours and fifty minutes and five hours and forty-nine minutes.

On September 4, the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party wrote a letter to congratulate all the workers in the steelmaking department, encouraging them to create greater production achievements. All the workers felt infinitely excited and expressed their determination to resolutely respond to the call of the Party, strive to overfulfill this year's production plan, and produce and save more wealth for the country.

    天津钢厂炼钢部职工展开增产节约竞赛
    【新华社天津十一日电】国营天津钢厂炼钢部职工展开劳动竞赛，争取全面超额完成今年的国家生产计划。竞赛的目标是：缩短炼钢时间，做好护炉工作，在今年内减少一次中修，保证连续炼钢四百炉。在九月份中首先做到：某号平炉有十炉炼钢时间在七小时以内，其他平炉有三十炉炼钢时间在六小时以内。
    天津钢厂上半年虽然完成了生产总值计划，质量达到计划指标，实际成本也较计划降低了百分之四点三六，但由于工厂领导方面不重视贯彻苏联专家建议，平炉炼钢时间不能很快缩短，主要产品钢锭的产量只完成计划百分之九十七点六九。工厂领导方面和炼钢部职工检查了这种情况以后，就制订出贯彻苏联专家建议的具体计划。到八月中旬，炼钢部职工在苏联专家帮助下，提前三十七小时修好了某号平炉，对其他平炉也进行了挖补炉顶、前墙等工作。接着，职工们又响应工厂领导方面提出的平均七小时零十五分炼一炉钢的号召，展开了劳动竞赛。在竞赛中，工人和技术人员执行了苏联专家建议，每炉钢的冶炼时间已逐渐缩短。九月以来，各个平炉的平均冶炼时间已缩短到七时零四分。孙士凤、李万富两班工人并连续创造了五时五十分、五时四十九分的新纪录。
    九月四日，中国共产党天津市委员会写信向炼钢部全体职工祝贺，勉励他们创造更大的生产成绩。全体职工感到无限兴奋，表示坚决响应党的号召，争取超额完成今年的生产计划，为国家增产节约更多的财富。
