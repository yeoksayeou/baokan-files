The Central People's Government Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications issued instructions on August 27 concerning the basic situation of postal and telecommunications work and the work deployment for the second half of 1953. The instructions first analyzed the achievements and shortcomings of past work, pointing out that in 1952, the total revenue of postal and telecommunications services completed 100.2% of the annual plan, an increase of 16.9% in business volume and 23.6% in revenue compared to 1951. It basically guaranteed the communication needs of state organs, enterprises, and the people. The advanced operational method of Guo Xiuyun in long-distance telephone services was summarized and promoted, and advanced experiences emerged in urban telephone services, mail sorting, line maintenance, and telegram dispatch. The total revenue plan for postal and telecommunications services in 1953 will increase by 17% compared to 1952; the cost reduction rate is 1.8%; and the basic construction totals 987 projects, with the planned workload equivalent to 226.1% of that in 1952. Through the struggle to inspect business deviations and oppose bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline in the first half of the year, serious errors of forced apportionment and deception that violated policies and alienated the masses have been corrected and are being corrected, and a transformation has begun in improving service attitude and improving the quality of work. The total volume of business and revenue are increasing. Although this is the beginning of the transformation, it is beneficial to the work in the second half of the year.

Over the past three years, although the postal and telecommunications departments have done a lot of work, they have made serious mistakes on some important issues. For example, the eagerness for success in the "unified postal distribution" of newspapers and periodicals, blind sales, and deviations occurred; handling of inappropriate purchasing of goods and consulting services; soliciting congratulatory telegrams from a purely business perspective; general deployment of increasing production and practicing economy without considering the characteristics of postal and telecommunications, proposing "actively developing business" as the content of labor competitions; and unrealistic newspaper and periodical distribution plans lacking steps. These incorrect or not entirely correct measures resulted in adverse phenomena of alienation from the masses and violation of policies, both internally and externally. The work emphasized quantity over quality, causing serious errors, backlogs, and obstacles. The greedy and rash approach to basic construction resulted in many projects not being completed, accumulating national funds. The main reason for these errors is that decentralism, which is detached from the leadership of the Party and the government, has long existed in the postal and telecommunications system. They do not know how to rely on the Party and the government, and they work behind closed doors from top to bottom. They only ask about business and do not ask about politics. They are often unclear about what is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, what is harmful, what should be implemented, what should be opposed, what can be done now, and what should be done later, resulting in the disconnection of business from politics and reality.

The instructions also pointed out the main problems currently hindering postal and telecommunications work:

First, the work of safeguarding national communication secrets in the postal and telecommunications departments is not carried out well enough, and there are phenomena of impure organizations. Incidents of losing, leaking, and stealing national communication secrets still occur frequently, and the situation of eavesdropping on telephones and "small broadcasts" is very serious. The confidentiality system has not been well established.

Second, the quality of postal and telecommunications work is poor, and errors, backlogs, and obstacles are very serious. There are many backlogs, mis-sortings, and mis-deliveries of mail. Some large municipal bureaus find hundreds of large and small errors in a day. Telegrams often have errors. The circuit utilization rate of long-distance telephones and the connection rate of urban telephones are very low. There are many obstacles, the sound quality is not good, and the interests of the state and the people are often damaged. The existence of these problems is mainly due to poor management, the lack of an established responsibility system, and the lack of original records and management indicators; at the same time, the political and ideological education of employees is too poor, and there is a lack of a foundation of serious and responsible ideological awareness.

Third, there is insufficient understanding of the political significance of newspaper and periodical distribution work. At present, the needs for newspapers and periodicals are still unclear, and there are blind distribution phenomena of giving less to those who need more and giving more to those who need less. In many places, distribution personnel believe that after correcting the apportionments, they can breathe a sigh of relief and do not actively do a good job in distribution work; or they mechanically implement the regular fixed-quota subscription method, without seriously solving difficulties for readers, and even treat readers with a rejection attitude. Therefore, omissions, mis-deliveries, and readers not being able to subscribe to newspapers and periodicals still occur frequently.

Fourth, the basic construction plan and business plan are not realistic, and there are many elements of blindness and temporary patchwork, which are far from meeting the requirements of national planning work. First of all: the preparation of the basic construction plan lacks a serious and responsible spirit and an overall concept, showing the phenomenon of greed and rashness, and even shoddy workmanship. They did not carefully collect materials, conduct investigations and research, and distinguish priorities according to needs and possibilities, but instead were either clueless or asked for the sky-high price. Due to insufficient knowledge of the situation, what should not be reduced has been reduced, and what should not be included has been included in the plan, so the number of sudden emergency tasks has increased. In this way, the plan loses its control function and changes frequently, seriously affecting the progress of design, construction, and supply work. Secondly, the supply work lacks careful planning, and material preparation is too centralized. They are clueless about warehouse materials, and the timing and specifications of domestic orders are not well grasped, often resulting in untimely supply and mismatches between supply and demand, which leads to some basic construction projects being idle and waiting for materials. Thirdly, the law of business development has not been well grasped, there is a lack of foresight, and the postal and telecommunications equipment of major trunk lines and major bureaus often becomes overloaded and unable to cope, especially failing to keep up with the needs of expanded and newly built factories and new industrial cities.

The instructions proposed several tasks that the postal and telecommunications departments should first concentrate on in the second half of the year:

First, strengthen the work of safeguarding national communication secrets. First of all, education on safeguarding national secrets should be widely carried out among cadres and employees to improve their consciousness of safeguarding national secrets, strictly establish various work procedure systems, and establish a confidentiality responsibility system. Resolutely oppose the ideas of not paying attention to confidentiality and being lightly armed with the enemy, overcome harmful phenomena such as eavesdropping on secrets and "small broadcasts," and prevent the occurrence of theft of secrets. At the same time, the key parts of postal and telecommunications should be gradually tightened politically and organizationally in a planned and step-by-step manner to ensure national communication secrets.

Second, carry out patriotic labor competitions and promote advanced experiences with improving the quality of postal and telecommunications as the main content, overcome the current prominent and serious phenomena of errors, backlogs, and obstacles, and establish a serious and responsible service ideology. In launching the competition, cadres and employees should be educated on the advantages and disadvantages of the current poor quality to improve understanding, discover problems, thereby improve management, improve operation methods and technical measures, improve labor organization, strengthen a sense of responsibility, correct the phenomenon of no one being responsible, and achieve the purpose of improving the quality of postal and telecommunications work and improving work efficiency. Moreover, feasible quality indicators must be set according to different work levels and conditions, a management system and a responsibility system must be established, and the work of enterprise management must be improved. To this end, in organizing labor competitions, discussions should be launched from the bottom up by relying on trade unions according to the actual situation, so that cadres and employees can clearly understand the purpose and requirements of the competition. District, provincial, and municipal bureaus should make full preparations ideologically and organizationally, and should organize working groups to help two or three postal and telecommunications bureaus to conduct a quality inspection with emphasis, obtain experience, and guide and promote the overall competition.

In the labor competition, it is necessary to emphasize learning from the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union and our country. In addition to continuing to deeply promote Guo Xiuyun's operational method, promote the mail delivery method of Beijing and Tianjin, the advanced working method of the urban telephone mechanical group of the Shenyang Telecommunications Bureau, and focus on promoting the advanced experience of the Tianjin Postal Receiving and Dispatching Department. And one or two average advanced quotas must be determined in the promotion of Guo Xiuyun's operational method and other advanced experiences for trial quota management next year. In the process of promoting advanced experiences, special attention should be paid to correcting the idea of trying to create one's own set without being willing to promote existing advanced experiences. In carrying out labor competitions and promoting advanced experiences, attention should be paid to appropriately solving safety and hygiene, and solving the problem of working hours and public holidays as much as possible according to existing conditions.

Third, under the leadership of the local Party committee propaganda department and government competent department, closely cooperate with the publishing department, and do a good job in the subscription, transportation, and delivery of newspapers and periodicals with a realistic spirit. To this end, the following three tasks must be done first: First, correct certain erroneous understandings of the work of distributing newspapers and periodicals among cadres and employees, so that they clearly understand the great political significance of distribution work, overcome the erroneous idea of only seeking convenience for themselves and not overcoming difficulties for readers, and strive to basically change phenomena such as refusal to subscribe, omissions, and errors this autumn. Second, the provincial bureau distribution section should be quickly established and improved, the distribution personnel of the county bureau should be fixed and supplemented, and the rural postal personnel should be enriched. Determine the distribution leadership relationship between provinces and counties, and establish a distribution management system from provinces to county bureaus. Third, with the distribution department as the main force, organize forces to clarify the general direction of distribution and the approximate numbers of objective needs of major newspapers and periodicals to ensure that the distribution work has a correct basis.

Fourth, strengthen planning and statistical work. Overcome the idea of not paying attention to planning work. Therefore, first, it is necessary to understand the needs of all parties for postal and telecommunications as much as possible. Distinguish between primary and secondary, proceed from what is possible and necessary, and propose a practical and feasible basic construction plan for the next year in the spirit of seeking truth from facts, preventing the tendency of greed and rashness and the conservative tendency arising from insufficient estimation of objective conditions. Second, it is necessary to establish and improve planning and statistical departments, do a good job in sorting out and implementing the regular statistical report system, strengthen the collection and sorting of data. Clean up and simplify the current forms and reports to make them practical and feasible, and oppose the bad habit of falsely reporting numbers and falsely reporting achievements. Third, it is necessary to prepare the plan for 1954. Understand objective needs and subjective capabilities, pay attention to summarizing the implementation of the plan in the first half of this year, estimate the degree to which it may be completed in the second half of the year to study the plan for next year. Collect and study the main quota materials, and carry out the necessary survey and design work.

Fifth, in basic construction work, the supply and transportation of equipment and materials should be done well, inventory equipment and materials should be cleaned up, a warehouse management system should be gradually established, the division of labor for material preparation should be clarified, and a graded and regional responsibility system should be implemented. Appropriately strengthen the basic construction force, strengthen the leadership of planning, design, and construction, improve the organization, concentrate the use of force, and ensure the timely conduct of survey and design and construction of major projects. Education for design and engineering personnel should also be strengthened to gradually change the bourgeois views and conservative ideas that still exist in some personnel. Provincial and municipal bureaus should conduct inspections and research on construction sites with emphasis, expose waste and the phenomenon of no one being responsible. And summarize experience, educate cadres and employees, improve project quality, and improve construction efficiency and equipment utilization efficiency. Attention must also be paid to safe production during construction.

The instructions finally emphasized that in order to ensure the completion of the above-mentioned key tasks, it is necessary to firmly rely on the leadership of the Party and the government, resolutely correct the serious errors of being detached from the leadership of the Party and the government that existed in the past, overcome decentralism, subjectivism, and bureaucracy, and improve the political and ideological nature of the work. All issues of policy principles must be reported to the Party committees and governments above the provincial and municipal levels for review and approval before implementation. In dealing with problems, it should proceed from reality, consider the convenience of the people, and consider the specific difficulties of the lower levels. At the same time, political work must be strengthened, and a political work system must be established. The main content of political work is to carry out the work of the Party, develop the organization of the Party, train and select cadres, implement the policies of the Party and the laws of the country, safeguard national secrets, improve the political awareness of employees, and give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of employees to ensure the completion of business and basic construction plans. At present, the weakest link in the postal and telecommunications departments is the lack of political and ideological work. Therefore, political work must be carried out around various businesses and various important measures to ensure that business is not separated from politics. To this end, it is determined to set up political deputy positions in provincial (municipal) bureaus, municipal bureaus under provincial jurisdiction, central bureaus, and county bureaus, and provincial (municipal) bureaus and larger municipal bureaus under provincial jurisdiction will also set up office institutions for political work to be solely responsible for political work. In addition, it is also necessary to change certain unreasonable phenomena in the current organizational leadership and organizational structure. In order to do the above work well, the instructions require leading cadres at all levels to resolutely overcome past mistakes, and under the leadership of the Party and the government, work hard with all employees to complete the main work in the second half of the year.

    中央邮电部布置下半年中心工作
    中央人民政府邮电部于八月二十七日发出关于邮电工作基本情况与一九五三年下半年工作部署的指示。指示首先分析了过去工作的成绩和缺点，指出一九五二年邮电业务的总收入完成了年度计划百分之一百点二，较一九五一年增加业务量百分之一十六点九，增加收入百分之二十三点六。基本上保证了国家机关、企业与人民的通信需要。总结和推广了长途电话方面的郭秀云先进操作法，出现了市内电话、邮件分拣、线路维护、电报拍发等先进经验。一九五三年的邮电业务计划总收入将比一九五二年提高百分之一十七；成本降低率为百分之一点八；基本建设共九百八十七项，计划完成工作量等于一九五二年百分之二百二十六点一。经过上半年检查业务偏向和反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的斗争，纠正了和正在纠正着违反政策、脱离群众的强迫摊派、欺骗蒙哄的严重错误，并在改善服务态度和提高工作质量方面开始转变。业务总量和收入均在增加。这虽是转变的开始，但对下半年工作是有利的。
    三年多来，邮电部门虽然做了很多工作，但在若干重要问题上犯了严重错误。如报刊“邮发合一”的急于求成，盲目包销，出了偏差；办了不应当办的代购货物和征询业务；以单纯业务的观点去招揽庆贺电报；离开邮电特点笼统地布置增产节约，提出以“主动发展业务”为劳动竞赛内容；报刊计划发行的脱离现实，缺乏步骤。这些不正确或不完全正确的措施，其结果是对内对外都产生了脱离群众、违反政策的不良现象；工作中重量轻质，造成严重的差错、积压和障碍，基本建设的贪多冒进，致不少工程没有完成，积压了国家的资金。产生这些错误的主要原因，是由于在邮电系统中长期存在着脱离党和政府领导的分散主义，不晓得依靠党和政府，从上到下都关起门来办事。只问业务，不问政治，对于那些是对国计民生有利的，那些是有害的；那些是应该贯彻的，那些是应该反对的；那些是办得到的，现在就应办；那些是现在办不到的，应该缓办等等，多不明确知道，致使业务和政治脱节，也和实际脱节。
    指示又指出了目前妨碍邮电工作的主要问题：
    一、邮电部门保守国家通信机密的工作进行得很不够和存在着组织不纯的现象。遗失、泄漏、盗窃国家通信机密的事件还不断发生，偷听电话、小广播的情况很严重。保密制度也还没有很好地建立。
    二、邮电工作质量低劣，差错、积压和障碍很严重。邮件的积压、误拣、误投很多，有的大市局在一天中发现的大小差错竟达数百件，电报经常发生差错，长途电话的电路利用率与市内电话的接通率很低，障碍多，音质不好，常使国家和人民的利益遭受损失。这些问题的存在，主要是管理不善，责任制没有建立，以及缺少原始记录和管理指标；同时在职工中的政治思想教育太差，缺乏认真负责的思想觉悟基础。
    三、对报刊发行工作的政治意义认识不足，目前对报刊的需要仍然心中无数，还发生需要多者少给、需要少者多给的盲目分配现象。在许多地方的发行人员中，认为在纠正摊派之后，可以松一口气，不积极作好发行工作；或者机械地执行定期定额预订办法，而不认真负责去替读者解决困难，甚至以拒订的态度去对付读者。因此，漏发、错发和读者订不到报刊的事情仍不断发生。
    四、基本建设计划和业务计划不切合实际，盲目性和临时拼凑成分很大，远不能适应国家计划工作的要求。首先是：编制基本建设计划缺乏认真负责的精神与整体观念，表现出贪多冒进甚至粗制滥造的现象。没有认真地搜集材料，进行调查研究，根据需要和可能分清轻重缓急，而是心中无数或漫天要价。由于掌握情况不够，将不应削减的削减了，不应列入的反而列入了计划，因而突然增加的紧急任务也就多了。这样，使计划失去控制作用，并且变动频繁，严重地影响了设计、施工和供应工作的进行。其次，供应工作缺乏周密计划和筹料过分集中，对仓库物资心中无数，国内订货的时间和规格也没有很好掌握，常发生供应不及时、供需不符的现象，以致使某些基本建设工程窝工和停工待料。再次，对业务的发展规律未能很好掌握，缺乏预见，经常发生主要干线和主要局所的邮电通讯设备负荷过重、无法应付的状况，尤其是赶不上扩建与新建设的工厂及新的工业城市的需要。
    指示提出了邮电部门下半年应首先集中力量做好的几项工作：
    一、加强保守国家通信机密的工作。首先应在干部和职工中广泛进行保守国家机密的教育，提高干部和职工保守国家机密的自觉性，严格建立各种工作手续制度，建立保密责任制。坚决反对不重视保密和轻敌麻痹思想，克服偷听机密和“小广播”等有害现象，防止偷窃机密的事件发生。同时要有计划有步骤地将邮电要害部位在政治上组织上一步一步地严密起来，以确保国家通信机密。
    二、以改进邮电质量为主要内容，开展爱国主义的劳动竞赛和推广先进经验，克服目前突出的严重的差错、积压和障碍的现象，树立认真负责的服务思想。在发动竞赛中，应以现有质量低劣的利害来教育干部和职工，借以提高认识，发现问题，从而改善管理，改进操作方法与技术措施，改善劳动组织，加强责任心，纠正无人负责现象，达到改进邮电工作质量、提高工作效率的目的。而且必须按不同的工作水平和条件定出可行的质量指标，建立管理制度和责任制，将企业管理工作提高一步。为此，在组织劳动竞赛中，应根据实际情况，依靠工会，发动职工自下而上地展开讨论，使干部和职工中明确认识竞赛的目的和要求。区、省、市局应做好思想上、组织上的充分准备，并应组织工作组帮助二、三个邮电局，有重点地进行一次质量检查，取得经验，以指导与推动全面的竞赛。
    在劳动竞赛中，必须强调学习苏联的和我国的先进经验。除了继续深入推广郭秀云操作法外，并推广北京、天津邮件投递法，沈阳电信局市话机械股的先进工作法，以及重点推广天津邮政收发部门的先进经验。并须在郭秀云操作法及其他先进经验的推广工作中确定一、二种平均先进定额，以便明年试行定额管理。在推广先进经验过程中，特别要注意纠正企图自己搞一套而不愿推广已有的先进经验的思想。在开展劳动竞赛和推广先进经验中，要注意适当地解决安全卫生，以及根据现有条件尽可能地解决工时公休问题。
    三、在当地党委宣传部门及政府主管部门的领导下，与出版部门密切合作，以实事求是的精神，做好报刊发行的收订、发运和投递工作。为此，先要做好以下三件工作：首先纠正干部和职工中对发行报刊工作的某些错误认识，使他们明确认识发行工作的重大政治意义，克服只图自己方便，不为读者克服困难的错误思想，求得今秋基本上将拒订、漏发、差错等现象改变过来。第二、应迅速建立和健全省局发行科，并固定与补充县局的发行人员，充实乡邮人员。确定省、县之间的发行领导关系，并建立省对县局发行管理制度。第三、以发行部门为主，组织力量，弄清主要报刊的发行动向和客观需要的大体数字，保证发行工作有正确的依据。
    四、加强计划与统计工作。克服不重视计划工作的思想。因此，第一，要尽可能地了解各方面对邮电的需要。分清主次，从可能与必需出发，本着实事求是的精神，提出切实可行的下年度基本建设计划，防止贪多冒进的偏向和对客观情况估计不足而来的保守偏向。第二，要建立和健全计划、统计部门，做好整理与贯彻定期统计表报制度，加强资料的收集、整理。清理及简化现行表报，使之切实可行，反对假报数字、假报成绩的恶劣作风。第三，要编好一九五四年的计划。了解客观需要与主观能力，注意总结今年上半年的计划执行情况，估计下半年可能完成的程度来研究明年的计划。收集、研究主要的定额材料，进行必要的勘查设计工作。
    五、基本建设工作应做好器材供应与运输工作，清理库存器材、逐步建立仓库管理制度，明确筹料分工，实行分级分区负责制。适当地壮大基本建设力量，加强计划、设计和施工的领导，健全组织，集中使用力量，保证主要工程的勘查设计及施工的及时进行。还应加强对设计和工程人员的教育，逐渐改变某些人员中尚存在的资产阶级观点和保守思想。各省市局应有重点地深入工地进行检查和研究，揭发浪费与无人负责现象。并总结经验，教育干部和职工，改进工程质量，提高施工效率与设备使用效能。在施工中还必须注意安全生产。
    指示最后着重指出：为保证上列几项主要工作的完成，必须坚决依靠党和政府的领导，坚决纠正过去严重存在的脱离党政领导的错误，克服分散主义、主观主义和官僚主义，提高工作的政治性、思想性。凡属政策原则性的问题必须分别向省市以上党委、政府请示，经审查批准后执行。在处理问题时应从实际出发，为人民方便打算，为下边的具体困难着想。同时，还须加强政治工作，建立政治工作制度。政治工作的主要内容是进行党的工作，发展党的组织，培养选拔干部，贯彻党的政策和国家的法令，保守国家机密，提高职工政治觉悟，发挥广大职工的积极性和创造性，以保证业务和基本建设计划的完成。目前邮电部门中最薄弱的就是缺乏政治思想工作，因此，必须使政治工作围绕着各种业务、各个重要措施来进行，以保证业务不和政治脱节。为此，确定在省（市）局、省辖市局、中心局及县局都设政治副职，省（市）局及省辖较大市局并设政治工作的办公机构，专责进行政治工作。此外，还需要改变现行组织领导和组织机构的某些不合理现象。为了作好以上工作，指示要求各级领导干部坚决克服过去的错误，在党和政府的领导下，和全体职工努力完成下半年的主要工作。
