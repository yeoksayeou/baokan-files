    Beijing No. 5 Construction Engineering Company Should Inspect Waste of Timber on Construction Sites
    Reader Liu Qingxiang writes: The waste of timber on some construction sites belonging to the Beijing No. 5 Construction Engineering Company is very serious. For example, on the 3592 construction site under the company, in May and June of this year, without any procedures, construction timber was casually used to make furniture, including 5.35 cubic meters of new red and white pine, 0.5 cubic meters of new yellow flower pine, and 2.84 cubic meters of old pine; for temporary construction projects, 7.7 cubic meters of plywood, about 6 cubic meters of yellow flower pine and elm, 120 cedar poles of 7 meters long, and 795 cedar poles and planks of 2.5 meters to 4.5 meters long were used. The 3531 construction site under the company used more than 11 cubic meters of construction timber to make furniture this year without approval. The 3512 construction site also used a batch of construction timber to make 300 pieces of furniture. As for the phenomenon of casually using cedar poles, planks, and other new materials to build sheds, temporary warehouses, and other temporary facilities, it is even more common on various construction sites.
    The main reason for the waste of timber is that the material department of the company and the leaders of some construction sites do not pay attention to saving national timber. The construction sites only care about their own convenience and ask for materials when they are needed; the company's material department only issues materials according to the quantity requested by the construction sites, without carefully reviewing the plans in advance or inspecting them afterward. In addition, the on-site management work and material requisition procedures of some construction sites are very chaotic, which also increases the waste of timber.
    The above-mentioned waste of timber phenomenon cannot continue, and it is suggested that Beijing No. 5 Construction Engineering Company quickly take effective measures to stop it.

    北京市第五建筑工程公司应检查工地浪费木材现象
    读者刘庆祥来信：北京市第五建筑工程公司所属某些工地浪费木材的情况很严重。如该公司所属三五九二工地在今年五、六月份内，未经任何手续，就随便把建筑木材用来制造家具的，有红、白松新料五点三五立方公尺，黄花松新料零点五立方公尺，旧松料二点八四立方公尺；用新料建筑暂设工程的，有合子板七点七立方公尺，黄花松和榆木约六立方公尺，七公尺长的杉槁一百二十根，二公尺半到四公尺半长的杉槁和排木七百九十五根。该公司所属三五三一工地今年未经批准，就把十一立方公尺以上的建筑木材用来制造家具。三五一二工地也曾用一批建筑木材做了三百件家具。至于随便拉用杉槁、排木和其它新料来搭工棚、临时仓库等临时设施的现象，在各工地更是不少。
    造成浪费木材的原因主要是该公司材料部门和某些工地的领导人不重视节约国家木材。工地方面只图自己方便，缺料就要；公司材料部门对工地用料只是按数照发，事先既不认真审核计划，事后也不检查。此外，某些工地的现场管理工作和材料领发手续都很紊乱，也增加了木材的浪费。
    以上这种浪费木材的现象不能再继续下去了，建议北京市第五建筑工程公司迅速采取有效措施加以制止。
