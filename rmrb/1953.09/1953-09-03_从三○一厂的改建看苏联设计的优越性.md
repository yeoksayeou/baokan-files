Seeing the Superiority of Soviet Design from the Reconstruction of Factory 301
Wei Hanguang, Deputy Director of Factory 301

The basic construction project of Factory 301 is a reconstruction, and the design task is to utilize existing buildings and equipment as much as possible to transform it into a new type of factory. This design was carried out under the direct leadership of Soviet experts, and after more than a year, it is now nearing completion. Through brief contact with Soviet experts, I have the following insights into Soviet design work:

I. Scientific Design Organization and Division of Labor

A major feature of Soviet design organization is its meticulous division of labor and clear tasks. Our design institutions generally only include production, mechanical, and civil engineering aspects, with a rough and vague division of labor and unclear tasks. Soviet design organizations generally include professional groups for production, machinery, civil construction, electrical, water supply, ventilation, heating, instrumentation, boiler, gas generation station, and overall layout. Within these groups, there is even more detailed division of labor. In this way, each designer has a clear task and responsibility, and can better delve into their own business to improve the efficiency and quality of design work.

Soviet design institutions have a detailed division of labor, and at the same time, the mutual connections are very scientific and close. For example, in the design of a production workshop, the first step is for the production professional group to discuss with the main related groups (such as mechanical, electrical, ventilation, civil construction, etc.) based on the determined production volume and production plan to initially determine the task. Other professional groups then propose tasks to each other according to their own requirements. For example, the ventilation group, according to the requirements of ventilation technology, proposes the layout and cross-section of the ventilation and exhaust systems to the civil construction group, and the civil construction group carries out structural design under suitable ventilation conditions. Another example is that the mechanical group makes a configuration diagram of the workshop equipment according to the task of the production group, and then requires the civil construction group to make the foundation map of the equipment, etc.

II. Collecting Information with a Serious Attitude and Scientific Methods

Soviet experts often teach us: "Without correct original data, there is no correct design." In the reconstruction design of Factory 301, experts carefully and extensively collected original data related to the design. During the preliminary design, in order to understand the geological hydrology of the factory, drilling was carried out in many places to determine the direction and speed of water flow. For all the factory's water wells, whether in use or abandoned, divers were required to go to the bottom of the wells to investigate the pipeline situation. Each water well was subjected to pumping tests and water quality analysis to determine whether it met the requirements of future production. In the technical design stage, not only was the original data rechecked, but also the foundation of the factory building to be utilized was selected for excavation to measure the depth and settlement. In addition to actual measurement of metal structures and brick walls, stress tests were also carried out. For the foundation of the 120-meter high chimney, in addition to geological drilling for soil analysis, a full-load pressure test was carried out according to the foundation depth. The results were appraised by geological experts, and the foundation design was carried out after a conclusion was made.

In order to understand and grasp the supply of raw materials required for future production, detailed investigations were carried out on the origin of raw materials, reserves, quality specifications, transportation distance, and methods.

Equipment data on the mechanical and electrical aspects, such as product catalogs of various equipment (including detailed specifications, performance, and drawings of the equipment), and the location of manufacturing factories, were also carefully collected as the basis for design. Experts are often not satisfied with some written materials, but often go to the manufacturing factories themselves to understand the actual situation.

Experts also take an extremely serious and scientific attitude towards the utilization of old equipment.

For more significant issues, such as the supply of raw materials, fuel, and electricity, experts require that the issues must be resolved through formal written procedures.

This serious and scientific work attitude ensures that the design will not be wrong due to incorrect data. What a stark contrast this is to the work style of relying solely on fragmented experience, subjective conjecture, carelessness, and hearsay! Soviet design workers also cherish experience very much, but they never replace scientific surveys and experiments with fragmented experience.

III. Considering Issues Comprehensively and with Foresight

Another characteristic of Soviet experts in design work is considering issues comprehensively and with foresight. Bourgeois design is short-sighted. In order to obtain high profits, they often do not consider future development and comprehensive and reasonable allocation. The old layout of Factory 301 fully illustrates this point. For example, the original eastern boiler room was not built with foresight. With the continuous development of production, it could not meet the needs, and two boiler rooms had to be added nearby, one with twice the capacity of the original and one with four times the capacity of the original.

In contrast, Soviet design is comprehensive and has foresight. The organization attaches importance to the overall layout of the factory. The task of the overall layout group is to specifically control the overall configuration of the factory, formulate the location and elevation of each workshop, the transportation routes between workshops, the configuration of various pipe networks throughout the factory, etc. At the same time, it also considers the long-term development prospects of the entire factory. For example, the gas generation station of Factory 301 could have been rebuilt at the old location, but considering the needs of the second phase of development, a new location was chosen between the two factory buildings that use the most gas in order to achieve economic rationality.

IV. Advanced Economic and Technical Standards

Soviet design economic and technical standards are advanced. For example, after a major workshop in Factory 301 was completely rebuilt, although the factory building area was still the same as during the Japanese occupation of Manchuria, the production capacity increased by 1.9 times due to the adoption of advanced Soviet technical standards. Another example is that after another major production workshop was rebuilt, it only used 50% of the past factory building, but the production capacity increased by 20%.

Due to the adoption of advanced Soviet technical standards throughout the factory, the degree of mechanization in operation has been greatly improved, and much heavy and unnecessary manual labor has been reduced, so that the number of workers throughout the factory has been reduced by more than two-thirds to three-quarters compared to the Japanese occupation of Manchuria, while the output has increased by nearly two times.

V. Thorough Economic Accounting Ideas

Experts often teach us: A designer must carefully consider how to save state investment and use it in the most effective places. The idea of economic accounting is prominently expressed in the reconstruction design work of Factory 301. For example, the design decided to use an old factory building to establish a pig iron casting workshop, but metal structure roof trusses had to be used. The expert's handling of this old roof truss was not to simply demolish it, but to think of many solutions. As a result, the old roof frame was used as a timber warehouse for the civil construction repair workshop, rationally utilizing existing materials under the premise of ensuring engineering quality. Another example is the reconstruction project of a major production workshop. In order to utilize the original building, but also to make it a factory building that fully meets Soviet standards, many methods were devised, such as using support beams to replace columns to strengthen the load-bearing capacity of the factory building, which not only met the requirements of advanced technology, but also saved a lot of investment for the state.

Experts often taught us in the design process to learn to calculate carefully and calculate whether our design is economical. When designing the cold protection layer of a factory building, the expert let us carefully calculate, and the result proved that increasing the cold protection layer greatly reduced the amount of steam used for heating the room in winter, and the cost was only equal to the heating cost saved in one year, which conformed to the principle of economic accounting.

VI. Perfect Labor Protection Facilities

Capitalists, in pursuit of profits, can ignore the life and death of workers; while the Soviet Union pays attention to labor protection conditions everywhere in factory design. Soviet experts often say: "People are the most valuable asset. If the machine is broken, it can be repaired, but if a person dies, it cannot be recovered."

In the past, a major workshop in our factory had no ventilation equipment, and workers worked painfully in high temperature and harmful gases all day long. In order to change this harsh situation and enable workers to operate in a good air environment, Soviet experts designed a 120-meter-high chimney and a large-scale, well-equipped ventilation facility for us, fundamentally improving the conditions of labor operation. A production workshop used to be the dirtiest workshop, with particularly high dust and very poor light. The staff who came out of the workshop were all dirty and unrecognizable. Soviet experts fundamentally changed this situation in the reconstruction design. In order to avoid dust flying everywhere in the workshop, most of the production equipment has good ventilation devices. The most prominent is that all bucket conveyors are equipped with ventilation pipes at the feeding and discharging places, so that the dust raised by the rotation can be discharged from the ventilation pipes. This is a device that has not been seen in old-fashioned equipment.

In the design of the reconstruction project of Factory 301, those phenomena that disregarded the safety and convenience of workers were completely eliminated. The narrowest passage is also more than one meter wide, and each equipment has iron railings. In order to reduce heavy manual labor, even general machines are designed to be light and flexible as much as possible. For example, the handcarts used for internal transportation in a workshop use new magnesium-aluminum alloy wheels to reduce their weight; in order to reduce friction, special balls are installed under the turntables of the light railways.

All workshops have places for workers to rest, and the rest rooms have smoking rooms, lunch rooms, shower rooms, and changing rooms. The configuration of the rest rooms is adjacent to the workshop, and everything is very convenient. In order to take care of the workers who operate at high temperatures, Soviet experts designed equipment for us to supply special cool drinks, so that every worker can obtain specially formulated cool drinks. In Soviet design work, not only is the mass viewpoint of attaching importance to labor protection prominently manifested, but also the design organization guarantees this. The fact that the Soviet design organization has an independent ventilation professional group illustrates this point.

Due to the superficial understanding of Soviet design, the above-mentioned superiority of Soviet design is only a personal fragmented experience; advanced experience still needs us to deeply learn and summarize, so that we can better absorb the achievements and experience in Soviet construction work in order to improve our design work level.

    从三○一厂的改建看苏联设计的优越性
    三○一厂副厂长  韦涵光
    三○一厂基本建设工程是属于改建的性质，设计任务是尽量利用原有建筑物与设备，将它改造成一个新型工厂。这个设计是在苏联专家直接领导下进行的，经过一年多的时间，现在已接近结束。在与苏联专家短短的接触中，我对苏联设计工作有以下几点体会：
    一、科学的设计组织和分工
    苏联设计组织的一个主要特点是分工细致，任务明确。我们的设计机构一般地只包括生产、机械、土木等方面，分工粗糙、笼统，任务也含混不清。苏联的设计组织一般包括生产、机械，土建、电气、水道、通风、暖气、仪表、锅炉、煤气发生站、总平面图等专业小组，在专业组内还有更详细的分工。这样，每个设计人员工作任务明确，责任分明，也就能更好地钻研自己的业务，以提高设计工作的效率和质量。
    苏联设计机构有细致的分工，同时相互间的联系也非常科学而密切。例如一个生产车间的设计，第一步先由生产专业小组根据已经确定的生产量、生产方案与主要的有关小组（如机械、电气、通风、土建等）商讨，初步确定任务，其它专业组再根据自己的要求相互提出任务。如通风组根据通风技术条件的要求，对土建提出通风、排风系统的平面布置与断面，由土建组在适合的通风条件下进行结构设计。又如机械组根据生产组的任务作出车间设备的配置图，然后要求土建组作出设备的基础图等。
    二、以认真的态度和科学的方法搜集资料
    苏联专家经常教导我们说：“没有正确的原始资料就没有正确的设计。”在三○一厂的改建设计中，专家认真地、广泛地搜集了与设计有关的原始资料。初步设计时，为了了解厂内地质水文，曾进行多处的钻探来测定水流的方向与速度，对全厂的水井，无论是使用的或废弃的，都要求由潜水员实地到井底探清管道的情况，每个水井都进行了抽水试验与水质分析，以测定是不是符合将来生产上的要求。在技术设计阶段，不仅对原始资料进行复查，同时将准备利用的厂房基础选择挖土以测绘深度及下沉情况。对金属结构和砖墙，除进行实测外，均作了应力试验。一百二十公尺的大烟囱基础，除作地质钻探进行土壤分析外，并根据基础深度作全负荷的加压试验。这些结果请地质专家鉴定，作出结论后，才进行基础的设计。
    为了了解与掌握将来生产时所需原料的供应情况，对原料产地、埋藏量、质量规格、运输的距离和方法等，都进行了详细的调查。
    对机械及电气方面的设备资料，如各种设备的产品目录（包括设备的详细规格、性能及图纸）、制造工厂的地点等，也是很认真地搜集，以作为设计的依据。专家们往往不满足于一些书面的资料，而经常亲自到制造工厂去了解实际的情况。
    专家对于旧有设备的利用也是采取极其郑重与科学的态度。
    至于比较重大的问题，如原料、燃料、电力的供应，专家要求必须通过正式的书面手续才算将问题解决。
    这种认真的科学的工作态度，就保证了设计不会因资料的不正确而造成错误。这对只凭片断的经验主观臆测、粗枝大叶、道听途说的工作作风，该是一个多么鲜明的对比！苏联设计工作者也十分珍视经验，可是决不以片断的经验去代替科学的勘测与试验工作。
    三、全面地有远见地考虑问题
    苏联专家在设计工作中的另一特点是全面地有远见地考虑问题。资产阶级的设计是短视的，他们为了获取高额利润，往往不考虑今后的发展和全面合理的配置，三○一厂旧有的平面配置就充分说明了这一点。如原有的东部锅炉房，在修建时是没有远见的。随着生产的不断发展，不能适应需要，不得不在附近先后增设两座锅炉房，一个能力为原有的二倍、一个能力为原有的四倍。
    与此相反，苏联设计是全面的，有远见的，从组织上就重视了工厂的全面布置。总平面图组的任务就是专门掌握工厂的全面配置，制订各车间的位置与标高、车间与车间的交通运输线路、全厂各种管网的配置等；同时还考虑到全厂发展的远景，如三○一厂煤气发生站本可在旧有位置上进行改建，但因考虑到第二阶段发展的需要，而另行选择了位置，使之介于两个使用煤气最多的厂房之间，以达到经济合理的目的。
    四、先进的经济技术标准
    苏联设计经济技术标准是先进的。如三○一厂某主要车间经过彻底的改建后，虽然厂房面积仍和伪满时一样，但由于采取了苏联先进的技术标准，生产能力却比以前增加了一点九倍。又如另一主要的生产车间改建后，仅利用了过去厂房百分之五十，而生产能力却增加了百分之二十。
    由于在全厂范围内采用了苏联先进的技术标准，大大提高了操作中机械化的程度，减少了许多沉重的和不必要的体力劳动，使全厂劳动人员较伪满时减少了三分之二强至四分之三，而产量却增加了将近两倍。
    五、周密的经济核算思想
    专家经常教导我们：一个设计工作者必须细致地考虑如何节省国家投资使之用于最有效的地方。在三○一厂改建设计工作中就突出地表现了经济核算的思想。如设计中决定利用一个旧厂房建立生铁铸造车间，但必须采用金属结构屋架。专家对这个旧屋架的处理，不是简单地拆除，而是想了许多方案，结果将旧的房架应用作为土建修理车间的木材仓库，在保证工程质量的前提下合理地利用了现有的材料。又如某主要生产车间的改建工程，为了要利用原有的建筑物，但又要使之成为完全符合苏联标准的厂房，想了许多办法，如用托梁换柱的方法来加强厂房荷重的能力，既合乎先进技术的要求，又为国家节省了大量的投资。
    专家在设计的过程中经常教导我们要学会算细账，计算自己的设计是否经济。在设计某厂房的防寒层时，专家让我们认真地算了细账，结果证明增加了防寒层，大大地减少了冬季暖房的蒸气用量，而成本只等于一年中节约下来的暖房费用，是合乎经济核算的原则的。
    六、劳动保护设施的完善
    资本家为了追求利润，可以不管工人的死活；而苏联在工厂设计中处处注意到劳动保护的条件。苏联专家经常说：“人是最宝贵的财产，机械坏了还可以修，人死了就无法挽回了。”
    我厂某主要车间过去没有通风的设备，工人终日在高温与有害的气体下痛苦地工作着。为了改变这种恶劣的情况，使工人能在空气良好的环境下进行操作，苏联专家为我们设计了高达一百二十公尺的大烟囱和规模宏大、设备完善的通风设施，从根本上改善了劳动操作的条件。某生产车间过去是最脏的车间，粉尘特别大，光线也特别差，从该车间出来的工作人员都脏得不像样子。苏联专家在改建设计中从根本上改变了这种情况，为了免除灰尘在车间内到处飞扬，大部生产的设备均有良好的通风装置。最突出的是所有斗式输送机的加料、出料的地方都安有通风管，使因转动而扬起的灰尘能从通风管中排出，这是在旧式的设备中没有见到过的装置。
    在三○一厂改建工程的设计中，彻底地消灭了原有那些不顾工人安全和工作方便的现象，最狭的过道宽度也在一公尺以上，每个设备都有铁栏杆。为了减轻笨重的体力劳动，即使是一般的机械也尽一切可能设计得轻巧灵便。如某车间内部运输用手推车，为了减轻其重量，车轮采用新型的镁铝合金；为了减少摩擦力，在轻便铁道的转盘下装设了特殊的滚珠。
    所有车间都有工人休息的地方，休息室内部有吸烟室、午餐室、淋浴室、更衣室等。休息室的配置与车间邻近，一切都很方便。为了照顾到在高温下操作的工人，苏联专家为我们设计了供应特殊清凉饮料的设备，使每个工人都能取得特殊配制的清凉饮料。在苏联的设计工作中，不但表现了突出的重视劳动保护的群众观点，同时在设计组织上也保证了这一点。苏联设计组织有独立的通风专业小组，就说明了这一点。
    由于对苏联设计的认识还很肤浅，上面所提到苏联设计的优越性，仅是个人片断的体会；先进的经验还有待我们深入地学习与总结，使我们能更好地吸收苏联建设工作中的成就与经验，以提高我们的设计工作水平。
