Establishing Planned Management in Industrially Weak Mining Enterprises
Initial Experiences Gained by Some Factories and Mines in the Central South Region

Following the summary of production in the first half of the year, many industrial and mining enterprises in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, and Hunan and Henan provinces in the Central South region have successively focused on strengthening planned management, implementing operational plans, and strengthening dispatch work to arrange work for the second half of the year.

Many factories and mines in the Central South region mobilized the masses to discuss production plans in the second quarter and solved several key problems, initially overcoming the serious chaos in production in the first quarter. A small number of factories and mines have also strengthened planned management and implemented operational plans based on the discussion of plans, resulting in significant progress in production and management. The Xikuangshan Mining Bureau failed to complete its main production targets in the first quarter, and only 20 percent of the groups completed their plans in February. After implementing operational plans in the second quarter, it began to complete various production targets on a monthly basis in a more comprehensive manner. In May, 92 percent of the groups were able to complete their plans evenly on a ten-day basis. After implementing operational plans and strengthening dispatch work, the Fourth Automobile Assembly Plant reversed the situation of failing to complete its plans for five months and completed an average of 105 percent of its plans in June. Jiangling 324 Factory and Shuikoushan First Factory were among the units that strengthened planned management earlier and achieved good results. They also gained preliminary experience in strengthening planned management in factories and mines with weak work foundations:

1.  Leading cadres must study production and comprehensively grasp production, overcome the tendency of "neither understanding nor studying" that exists among a few cadres, and overcome the formalism of one-sidedly emphasizing going deep into the front line, but in fact not having a clear understanding of the overall production situation of the entire factory. They believe that to achieve "having a clear understanding," it is necessary to grasp planning, grasp the work of departments, study and analyze the daily production situation, go deep into the front line, discover problems, and solve key problems, in order to lead everyone to overcome weaknesses in work and achieve balanced and comprehensive completion of production plans.

2.  Give full play to the role of various functional departments and reverse the situation of "masses being active but management lagging behind" caused by long-term neglect of departmental work. The Xikuangshan Mining Bureau has done a relatively good job in this regard. On the one hand, they strengthened the political and ideological work of technical personnel and staff, and on the other hand, they focused on the key issues in the work of departments, formulated practical plans and necessary systems, and launched patriotic emulation campaigns around the formulation, discussion, and implementation of operational plans. This has significantly improved the previously very chaotic management work. The original raw data records were neither timely nor accurate. After rectification, it is now possible to completely count the completion of 98 varieties before 8:00 p.m. The original accounting department's accounts were backlogged for nearly two months, but now a preliminary group cost accounting system has been established, and group cost indicators can be calculated three days after each ten-day period. Technical personnel also frequently go deep into the tunnels with a purpose to help workers overcome technical difficulties in the implementation of operational plans, and create advanced methods such as the "mixed groove double blasting method" and the "deep hole groove method." The materials department can also supply materials in a timely manner according to the plan. Since May, the mine has achieved balanced production on a ten-day basis.

3.  In the formulation, discussion, and implementation of operational plans, it is necessary to earnestly mobilize the masses, actively overcome various difficulties, and carry out production in accordance with operational plans. This is even more important in factories and mines with weak work foundations. When formulating operational plans, Xikuangshan found that the rock of non-ferrous metal mines varies greatly. Therefore, in addition to analyzing the data from the previous month to identify the key issues to be solved in the following month, administrative cadres led the way and absorbed worker representatives to participate in "face-to-face appraisal." Engineers and worker representatives respectively put forward opinions on prospecting for the next month, and focused on studying several major factors in production, and finally determined the quota figures, overcoming the phenomenon of plans not being in line with reality. After the operational plan was prepared, the masses were mobilized to discuss it, find out the key problems in production, and formulate a technical measures plan to ensure the completion of the plan. The wind drill team found that the low blasting efficiency was the key to production during the discussion of the June plan, and then created the advanced "mixed groove double blasting method" to overcome the technical difficulties in completing the plan. When implementing the operational plan, the trade union launched a labor competition; the leadership also promoted advanced experiences to address weak links. At the same time, a "three-check" system (self-check, group check, inspector check) was established to check the implementation of the plan, so that the operational plan was gradually implemented.

4.  Political and ideological work must be strengthened. One of the reasons why the production plans of some factories and mines in the Central South region have been poorly completed is that the leading cadres have inconsistent ideas and each goes its own way. Therefore, they first unified the cadres' thinking by studying various documents on planned management, and unified their actions by going deep into production. At the same time, they conducted layer-by-layer mobilization from top to bottom and from inside to outside, publicized the relationship between factory and mine plans and the Five-Year Plan, and the relationship between individual and group plans and national plans, and established the concept that "planning is national law" in the minds of workers and staff, and conducted patriotic education with specific examples at any time, so that everyone consciously completed the plan.

However, most factories and mines in the Central South region did not pay attention to strengthening planned management on the basis of mass discussion of plans in the second quarter, so the progress of production management was not great, and the national production plan for the first half of the year was not completed comprehensively and evenly. Many factories and mines had many accidents and very low product quality. In view of this situation, the Central South Region's Iron and Steel, Non-Ferrous Metals, Machinery, Coal Industry and other administrative bureaus, the Central South Electric Power Management Branch Bureau, etc., have all determined that the implementation of planned management will be the central task for the second half of the year. The Central South Non-Ferrous Metals Administration Bureau specifically convened a meeting of factory directors of its subordinate factories and mines to discuss the instructions on planned management, introduce the experience of the Xikuangshan Mining Bureau in implementing planned management, and divided its subordinate factories and mines into three types to arrange work: The first type is a small number of factories and mines that have implemented operational plans and initially achieved balanced production, and have improved in terms of product quantity and quality. They should establish a responsibility system to further consolidate planned management; the second type is factories and mines that can generally guarantee the completion of production plans. They should implement operational plans and strengthen dispatch work to strengthen planned management; the third type is factories and mines that are still very chaotic in management. They should mobilize the masses to discuss production plans and carry out various rectification work. The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed all factories and mines to earnestly study the experience of the "May 3" factory while implementing planned management, conscientiously change the leadership's thinking and leadership style, comprehensively mobilize the masses with leadership, especially technical personnel and management personnel, and strengthen political and ideological work. The factories and mines under the Henan Provincial Department of Industry are actively rectifying raw data records to create conditions for the implementation of planned management.

    在工作基础薄弱的工矿企业中建立计划管理
    中南区部分厂矿获得初步经验
    中南区武汉市和湖南、河南两省的许多工矿企业在总结上半年生产之后，先后以加强计划管理，实行作业计划和加强调度工作为中心，布置下半年工作。
    中南区许多厂矿在第二季度中发动群众讨论了生产计划，并解决了若干关键问题，初步克服了第一季度中生产上严重的混乱现象。少数厂矿还在讨论计划的基础上加强计划管理，实行作业计划，使生产与管理工作有了显著进步。锡矿山矿务局第一季的主要生产指标没有完成，而且二月份只有占总数百分之二十的小组完成了计划，从第二季实行作业计划以后，便开始比较全面地按月完成各种生产指标，五月份已有百分之九十二的小组能按旬均衡地完成计划。汽车制配第四厂在实行作业计划和加强调度工作后，扭转了五个月没有完成计划的局面，六月份平均完成计划百分之一○五。加强计划管理较早而且获得成绩的，还有江零三二四工厂和水口山第一厂等单位。他们并获得了在工作基础薄弱的厂矿加强计划管理的初步经验：
    一、领导干部必须钻研生产、全面地掌握生产，克服在少数干部中存在的“既不懂，又不钻”的偏向，克服片面强调深入现场，而事实上却又对整个工厂生产情况心中无数的形式主义。他们认为要做到“心中有数”，必须抓计划，抓科室工作，研究分析每日的生产情况，深入现场，发现问题，解决关键问题，才能领导大家克服工作中的薄弱环节，达到均衡地全面地完成生产计划。
    二、充分发挥各职能部门的作用，扭转过去长期忽视科室工作而产生的“群众积极、管理落后”的局面。锡矿山矿务局在这方面作得比较好。他们一方面加强对技术人员和职员的政治思想工作，一方面围绕编制、讨论和贯彻作业计划，抓住科室工作中的关键问题，订出切实的计划与必要的制度，展开爱国主义竞赛。这样便使原来非常混乱的管理工作有了显著进步。原来的原始记录既不及时、又不准确，经过整顿以后，现在已能作到在当晚八时前将九十八种品种完成情况完全统计好。原来会计科的账目积压了近两个月，而现在还初步建立了小组成本核算制度，在每旬后三天便能计算出小组成本指标完成情况。技术人员也经常有目的地深入坑道，帮助工人克服实行作业计划中的技术上的困难，创造出“混合拉槽两次爆破法”和“深眼拉槽法”等先进方法。材料部门也能及时按计划供应。该矿从五月份起便实现了按旬均衡生产。
    三、在编制、讨论与贯彻作业计划中，必须认真发动群众，主动克服各种困难，按作业计划进行生产。这在工作基础薄弱的厂矿更为重要。锡矿山在编制作业计划时，因为有色金属矿的岩石变化很大，故除了根据上个月的资料分析，找出下月份应解决的关键问题外，还以行政干部为主，吸收工人代表参加，进行“壋头鉴定”。由工程师和工人代表分别提出下月份的探矿意见，并着重研究生产中的几个主要因素，最后确定定额数字，克服了计划不切合实际的现象。作业计划编制好以后，又发动群众进行讨论，找出生产上的关键问题，订出保证完成计划的技术措施计划。风钻队便是在讨论六月份计划时，找出爆炸效能低是生产中的关键，进而创造出“混合拉槽两次爆破法”的先进方法，克服了完成计划中的技术困难。在贯彻作业计划时，工会发动劳动竞赛；领导上又针对薄弱环节推广先进经验。同时还建立了检查计划执行情况的“三检”制度（本人检查、小组检查、检查员检查），使作业计划逐步贯彻。
    四、必须加强政治思想工作。中南区某些厂矿生产计划完成很差的原因之一，便是领导干部思想不统一，各行其是。因此他们首先从学习计划管理的各种文件来统一干部思想，以深入生产来统一行动。同时从上到下、从内到外地进行层层动员，宣传厂矿计划与五年计划的关系，个人、小组计划与国家计划的关系，在职工思想上树立起“计划就是国家法律”的观念，并且随时以具体事例进行爱国主义教育，使大家自觉地完成计划。
    但是，中南区大多数厂矿在第二季度中并没有注意到在群众讨论计划的基础上加强计划管理，因此使生产管理工作的进步不大，使上半年的国家生产计划也完成的不全面，不均衡。许多厂矿事故多、产品质量很低。根据这种情况，中南区的钢铁、有色金属、机械、煤业等管理局、中南电业管理分局等都确定下半年以贯彻计划管理为中心工作。中南有色金属管理局专门召集了所属厂矿长会议，讨论了计划管理的指示，介绍锡矿山矿务局实行计划管理的经验，并且将所属厂矿分成三种类型布置工作：第一类实行了作业计划，初步作到均衡生产，在产品数量质量上都有改进的少数厂矿，应建立责任制，进一步巩固计划管理；第二类一般能保证生产计划完成的厂矿，应实行作业计划和加强调度工作，加强计划管理；第三类是管理上还很混乱的厂矿，应发动群众讨论生产计划，并进行各种整顿工作。中共湖南省委指示各厂矿，在实行计划管理的同时，认真学习“五三”工厂经验，切实转变领导思想与领导作风，有领导地全面发动群众，特别是发动技术人员与管理人员，加强政治思想工作。河南省工业厅所属厂矿，正在积极整顿原始记录，为实行计划管理创造条件。
