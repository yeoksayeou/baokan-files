Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th: The public economy of Soviet collective farms has now developed into a multi-sectoral economy with high productivity and continuously increasing income. The development of the public economy in the "Zhdoptok-Zhevtoya" collective farm in the Kiev region and the Stalin collective farm in the Leningrad region are good illustrations of this.

	The "Zhdoptok-Zhevtoya" collective farm is a typical example of a farm that develops a variety of economic activities. Every year it plants more than 1,000 hectares (1 hectare equals 15 mu) of winter wheat, barley, buckwheat, and sugar beets, and cultivates a large number of melons and vegetables. It has also opened orchards and vineyards covering 40 hectares. This year it is raising more than 140 dairy cows, 285 pigs, and a large number of sheep. Last year, the total monetary income of the collective farm's public economy in various sectors was more than 2.2 million rubles. Among them, the income from melons, vegetables, and pig raising alone was more than 928,000 rubles. Due to the continuous adoption of high-efficiency agricultural machinery and advanced agricultural technology, the yield per unit area of ​​winter wheat, barley, buckwheat, sugar beet and other crops has increased to two or three times that of the early days of the farm’s establishment. In addition to these economic sectors, this collective farm also engages in sideline production such as beekeeping, oil extraction, and fish farming. Fish farming alone generated nearly 53,000 rubles last year. This year, the income from this sector will increase fourfold. Due to the continuous growth of production and the increase of income in various sectors of the public economy, the collective farm's accumulation fund has increased by 17.5 times in the past eight years, and the monetary income per hectare of land has increased from more than 1,200 rubles in 1951 to more than 2,000 rubles in 1952. The material and cultural life of the farm members has also improved accordingly. Electric lights and running water have been installed in the farm members' homes and on the farm's streets. In addition, the farm has established a primary school, nursery, kindergarten, and a club. The club has a radio broadcasting station, film projection equipment, and a library containing 3,000 books on political, artistic, and popular science subjects. Currently, the farmers of this collective farm are building twenty houses.
	
	The Stalin Collective Farm was formed three years ago by the merger of four small collective farms. The main sectors of its public economy are planting potatoes and vegetables and raising dairy livestock. Before the merger, public livestock farming was a backward sector in the original four collective farms. In 1950, the four farms had a total income of only 220,000 rubles in this area. Each dairy cow produced a maximum of 1,400 liters of milk per year. In recent years, due to the improvement of livestock feeding and management, and the full mechanization of the labor-intensive work in the livestock sector, livestock farming has become an important sector with high productivity and continuously increasing income in the public economy of the Stalin Collective Farm. In 1951, the monetary income in this area increased to 393,000 rubles, and this year it will increase to 1.5 million rubles. This year, the annual milk production per dairy cow will increase from 1,550 kilograms in 1951 to 3,000 kilograms. On the basis of continuous development of production, the material and cultural welfare of the collective farm members has also increased.

    苏联集体农庄公有经济不断发展
    【新华社十六日讯】莫斯科消息：苏联集体农庄的公有经济，现在已发展成为多部门的、生产力很高和收入不断增加的经济。基辅州“兹多普托克·热夫托亚”集体农庄和列宁格勒州斯大林集体农庄发展公有经济的情况，便是一个很好的说明。
    “兹多普托克·热夫托亚”集体农庄是一个典型的发展多种经济的农庄。每年它都种有一千多公顷（每公顷合十五亩）的冬小麦、大麦、荞麦、甜菜，栽种着大量的瓜类作物和蔬菜。它还开辟了占地四十公顷的果园和葡萄园。今年它饲养着一百四十多头乳牛、二百八十五口猪和大群的羊。去年该集体农庄公有经济各部门的货币收入共二百二十多万卢布。其中单是瓜果、蔬菜、养猪等部门就收入了九十二万八千多卢布。由于不断采用高效率的农业机器和先进的农业技术，农庄的冬小麦、大麦、荞麦、甜菜等农作物的单位面积产量，已提高为农庄成立初期的两三倍。除了上面这些经济部门以外，这个集体农庄还从事养蜂、榨油、养鱼等副业生产。仅只养鱼一项去年就收入了近五万三千卢布。今年这一部门的收入还将增加到四倍。由于公有经济各部门生产的不断增长和收入的增加，集体农庄的公积金在最近八年中已增加到十七倍半，每公顷田地的货币收入已从一九五一年的一千二百多卢布增加到一九五二年的两千多卢布。农庄庄员的物质和文化生活也随着提高了。在庄员的住宅和农庄的街道上，已安装了电灯和自来水设备。此外，农庄还设立了小学、托儿所、幼儿园和一个俱乐部。这个俱乐部内有无线电广播站、电影放映设备和一个藏有三千册政治、艺术和通俗科学书籍的图书馆。现在，这个集体农庄的农民正在建筑二十幢住宅。
    斯大林集体农庄是三年前由四个小集体农庄合并而成的。它的公有经济的主要部门是种马铃薯、蔬菜和饲养产乳牲畜。在没有合并以前，公有饲畜业在原先的四个集体农庄中都是落后的部门。一九五○年四个农庄在这方面总共只收入二十二万卢布。每头乳牛全年最多产一千四百公升牛乳。最近几年来，由于改善了牲畜的饲养管理工作，由于饲畜部门费力劳动的充分机械化，饲畜业已变成斯大林集体农庄公有经济中一个生产力很高、收入不断增加的重要部门了。一九五一年这一方面的货币收入就增加到三十九万三千卢布，今年将增加到一百五十万卢布。今年，每头乳牛的全年产奶量将从一九五一年的一千五百五十公斤提高到三千公斤。在生产不断发展的基础上，集体农庄庄员的物质和文化福利也增进了。
