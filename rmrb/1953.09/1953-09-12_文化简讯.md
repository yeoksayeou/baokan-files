    Harbin is Building a Workers' Tuberculosis Sanatorium
    Harbin is building a large-scale workers' tuberculosis sanatorium. The construction area of this sanatorium will be nearly 20,000 square meters, of which the ward area will be more than 11,000 square meters, accommodating 400 standard beds. The construction project started in July last year and by the end of August this year, 70 percent of the total project has been completed, and it is expected to be fully completed in mid-October. This workers' tuberculosis sanatorium is being built on the banks of the Hulan River in Harbin, with beautiful scenery and fresh air, which is very suitable for the recuperation of tuberculosis patients. This sanatorium is jointly invested in by the Northeast Administrative Committee and the Northeast Working Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and is specifically for workers in forestry, mining, factories and other enterprises in the northern part of Northeast China who suffer from tuberculosis. After the completion of this sanatorium, the medical equipment will also be relatively complete. The sanatorium will be equipped with internal medicine, surgery, X-ray room, laboratory, operating room, disinfection room and dressing room.
    Beijing's Western Suburb Zizhuyuan Park Construction Project Completed
    The construction project of Zizhuyuan Park in the western suburbs of Beijing has been completed, and a water release ceremony was held on August 13. During the construction period, the workers displayed a high degree of labor enthusiasm, launched red flag competitions, and created a "relay segment" method of transporting earth, saving the state 140 million yuan in expenses. Zizhuyuan is located west of Baishi Bridge outside Xizhimen. It was originally a lake, but later it was turned into rice fields due to siltation. Every summer, when the city uses water, the rice fields in Zizhuyuan also use the water from the Changhe River. However, after the rainy season, when the Changhe River rises, the water in Zizhuyuan cannot be released, and the rice fields are often flooded. After dredging, this problem has been solved, and an artificial lake with an area of ​​more than 145,700 square meters has been added, opening up a new park for the people of the capital.
    Two Wooden Coffin Han Tombs Discovered in the Eastern Suburbs of Guangzhou
    Two wooden coffin Han tombs were discovered successively on July 25 and August 2 in the Longshenggang construction area in the eastern suburbs of Guangzhou.

    The newly discovered ancient tombs are both rectangular. The first one is 5.24 meters long and 2.40 meters wide. Unearthed artifacts include two pottery houses in wooden structure style. One is special in form and exquisite in structure: all four sides are translucent walls with oblique and straight lattice windows. There are also brackets on the pillars. One of the doors of the house has two open doors, with door gods carved on the left and right. There are also two bronze mirrors: one is a "Shangfang Mirror"; and the other is a "Vermilion Bird and Black Tortoise Mirror", with detailed and vivid animal patterns. In addition, there are a total of 53 pieces of pottery plates, pottery wells, and agate, all of which are complete. The second tomb is 4.80 meters long and 2.64 meters wide. A total of 42 artifacts were unearthed, most of which are pottery. There is also a small sword and a small knife. The handle of the small knife is inlaid with gold thread, which is exquisite and beautiful. There is also a bronze box (container), which has not been found in the ancient bronzes unearthed in the suburbs of Guangzhou in the past six months; the copper is very thin, which shows that the copper smelting technology in ancient China had reached a considerable level. Both tombs have some remaining unrotted coffins inside, but there is no record of the age in the relics. According to preliminary judgment, the first tomb may be the remains of the early Eastern Han Dynasty; the second tomb may be the remains of the early Western Han Dynasty.

    哈尔滨正建设一座工人结核病院
    哈尔滨正在建设一座规模宏大的工人结核病院。这座病院的工程面积将近两万平方公尺，其中病室为一万一千多平方公尺，可设四百个标准床位。建设工程从去年七月开始到今年八月底，已完成工程总量的百分之七十，预计十月中旬可全部完工。这座工人结核病院是建筑在哈尔滨的呼兰河畔，风景幽美，空气清爽，很适宜于结核病的疗养。这座病院是东北行政委员会和中华全国总工会东北工作委员会共同投资建设的，专为东北北部地区森林、矿山、工厂等企业部门害有结核病的工人们进行疗养。这座病院建成后，在医疗设备方面也比较完善，院内设有内科、外科、爱克司光室、化验室、手术室、消毒室和敷料室等。
    北京西郊紫竹院公园修建工程完工
    北京市西郊紫竹院公园的修建工程已经完工，八月十三日举行了放水典礼。在施工期中，工人们发挥了高度的劳动热情，开展红旗竞赛，创造了“分段接力”运土法，给国家节省了一亿四千万元的开支。紫竹院在西直门外白石桥西边，原来是一片湖泊，后来因湖水淤塞改成稻田，每到夏天城区用水的时候，紫竹院的稻田也要用长河的水，而雨季后长河水涨时紫竹院的水又无法放出来，稻田往往被淹。经过疏浚后，这个问题就解决了，并增加了一个十四万五千七百余平方公尺面积的人造湖，给首都人民开辟了一处新的公园。
    广州东郊发现木椁汉墓两座
    广州市东郊龙生岗建筑工区，七月二十五日和八月二日先后发现木椁汉墓两座。
    新发现的这两座古墓都是长方形的。第一座长五公尺零二十四公分，阔两公尺零四十公分。出土器物有木构型式的两间陶屋，一座形式特殊，结构精美：四面都是通明的斜格和直棂的窗形墙壁。柱上还有斗拱。屋的一个门口有两扇打开的门，左右刻有门神。又有铜镜两面：一是“尚方镜”；一是
  “朱雀玄武镜”，兽纹细致、生动。此外，还有陶盘、陶井和玛瑙等共五十三件，都很完整。第二座墓长四公尺零八十公分，阔两公尺零六十四公分。出土的器物共四十二件，大部分是陶器。另有小剑、小刀各一把。小刀柄用金丝嵌镶着，精致美观。又有铜奁（盛器）一个，是广州近郊过去半年出土的古铜器中没有发现过的；铜很薄，足见我国古代的铜器冶铸技术已达相当高的水平。两墓都有一些残余未腐的棺木在内，但遗器中都没有年代记载。据初步判断，第一座墓可能是东汉初的遗迹；第二座可能是西汉初的。
