Anhui Province is preparing for the acquisition of new tobacco.

The flue-cured tobacco in Chuxian and Suxian Special Districts of Anhui Province is about to enter the market. Flue-cured tobacco is one of the main special products of the province. In order to welcome the new tobacco to the market, the Provincial Finance Committee, the Tobacco and Hemp Company, the Cooperative Federation, and related departments have promptly made preparations for the acquisition.

The Anhui Provincial Tobacco and Hemp Company has prepared sufficient funds based on the estimated market volume, and has renovated warehouses and acquisition sheds in various locations. In mid-July, the Provincial Finance Committee convened cadres from the Department of Commerce, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry, the Tobacco and Hemp Company, and the Cooperative, as well as representatives of tobacco farmers from tobacco-producing areas, to discuss the new grading standards and listen to the opinions of tobacco farmers. The Provincial Tobacco and Hemp Company also ran short-term training classes for grading and valuation personnel, training more than 160 inspection personnel. The Provincial Coal and Construction Company allocated nearly 30,000 tons of high-quality coal to meet the needs of tobacco farmers for curing tobacco; the Provincial People's Bank also issued loans to tobacco farmers.

The Provincial Department of Commerce issued instructions on August 25 regarding the acquisition of flue-cured tobacco. The instructions stated: This year, we must resolutely implement the new grading standards formulated by the central government, firmly grasp the principle of "high price for good tobacco, low price for poor tobacco," and strictly prevent the tendency of under-grading and under-pricing, in order to take care of the reasonable income of tobacco farmers and encourage tobacco farmers to produce. The Tobacco and Hemp Company should actively provide guidance and inspection to cooperatives in mastering grading techniques. Regarding market management issues, the instructions stated: Cooperatives should play a role in regulating the market and stabilizing prices, and strictly prevent private merchants from raising or lowering prices. The Tobacco and Hemp Company should also actively acquire low-grade tobacco that is used as raw material for handicrafts.

Currently, the Provincial Tobacco and Hemp Company has signed an agreement with the Provincial Cooperative Federation for the acquisition of flue-cured tobacco. The agreement stipulates the grade, specifications, price, acceptance, and delivery of flue-cured tobacco. The respective agencies of both parties at all levels are also signing acquisition contracts based on the spirit of the agreement. The Tobacco and Hemp Company and the Cooperative began purchasing at listed prices in major markets such as Bengbu, Huainan City, Liufu, Wudian, and Luqiao on August 25.

    安徽作好收购新烟准备工作
    安徽省滁县、宿县两专区烤烟即将上市。烤烟是该省主要特产之一。为迎接新烟上市，该省财委会、烟麻公司和合作总社及有关部门已及时作好收购的准备工作。
    安徽省烟麻公司已根据预计的上市量，准备了足够的资金，整修了各地仓库、收购棚。该省财委会在七月中旬召集商业厅、农林厅、烟麻公司、合作社等单位干部，以及烟产区农民代表，座谈新的分级标准，听取烟农意见。省烟麻公司还开办了评级估价员短期训练班，训练了一百六十多名验级人员。省煤建公司调拨了近三万吨品质优良的煤炭，供应烟农烤烟的需要；省人民银行也对烟农发放了贷款。
    该省商业厅在八月二十五日发出关于收购烤烟的指示。指示中说：今年必须坚决贯彻中央新制订的分级标准，切实掌握“优烟优价，劣烟低价”的原则，严防压级压价的偏向，以求照顾烟农合理收益，鼓励烟农生产。烟麻公司对合作社在掌握分级技术方面，应主动给以指导和检查。关于市场管理问题，指示中说：合作社要起调剂市场、稳定价格的作用，严防私商抬价压价，凡属手工业原料的低级烟，烟麻公司也应积极收购。
    现该省烟麻公司已与省合作总社签订收购烤烟协议。协议对烤烟等级、规格、价格、验收、交接等方面都作了规定。双方所属各级机构也正根据协议精神，签订收购合同。烟麻公司和合作社于八月二十五日已在蚌埠、淮南市、刘府、武店、炉桥等主要市场挂牌收购。
