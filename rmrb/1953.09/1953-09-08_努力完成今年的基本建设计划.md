1953 is the first year of China's planned economic construction. All aspects of the national economy will greatly develop on the existing foundation. One of the most important signs of national economic development is the significant increase in basic construction in industries, transportation, water conservancy, and other sectors. This year, the state's investment in basic construction accounts for approximately one-third of the total fiscal expenditure. There are 130 major construction projects: the construction and reconstruction of 75 industrial and mining enterprises; the commencement of construction on ten new railway lines; the construction of over 5,000 kilometers of highways; in water conservancy, the continued fundamental control of the Huai River and the Yongding River, and the commencement of fundamental control projects for the Liao River and the Han River; in education, the construction of new colleges for iron and steel, aviation, petroleum, geology, etc.; and a total national building area of 27 million square meters.

The beginning of anything is often difficult and important, and this is precisely the case with the state's basic construction. 1953 is the beginning of China's five-year construction plan, and the quality and timeliness of this year's various engineering constructions have an extremely important impact on our successful realization of the five-year plan, making it particularly significant.

Since the second half of 1952, the Central Committee and Chairman Mao have presciently instructed various economic departments and provincial and municipal party committees and governments to strengthen leadership over basic construction; to strengthen the basic construction force, especially to assemble and cultivate geological survey and design forces; and to expand basic construction teams in a planned and purposeful manner, mainly to enhance technical strength in construction. The Central Committee also pointed out that in basic construction work, it is necessary to oppose the mood and tendency of blindly advancing, attempting large-scale projects everywhere and in everything, without considering our capabilities; it is necessary to recognize the complexity and arduousness of basic construction, and to grasp the principle of focusing on key construction based on both needs and possibilities, practically placing basic construction on a reliable foundation. According to the above-mentioned principles of the Central Committee, various economic departments, local party committees, and governments have made tremendous efforts and carried out many arduous and complex tasks since the second half of 1952, thus enabling us to achieve many successes in basic construction in 1953. According to inspections, eleven departments, including heavy industry, fuel, the first machinery industry, the second machinery industry, light industry, textiles, railways, transportation, posts and telecommunications, agriculture, and water conservancy, completed 30 percent of the planned workload for basic construction in 1953 in the first half of the year. Both the proportion of completed tasks and the absolute quantity have increased significantly compared with the same period in 1952, and the quality of projects has also improved.

Our achievements in basic construction should not make us complacent or slack in any way. From now until the end of the year, there are only four months left for construction, and in the north, only a little more than two months. Completing the remaining workload (approximately 50 percent or more of the annual plan) in this short period is a very arduous task. At the same time, according to the inspection of work in the first half of the year, many shortcomings and even errors still exist in our basic construction work. For example, when some departments compiled plans, the idea of blindly advancing was not completely overcome, the principle of focusing on key construction was not sufficiently implemented, and there was insufficient attention or effort devoted to surveying and design work. Equipment, materials, technical strength, and construction forces were not well organized to achieve balance, which has affected the completion of basic construction tasks. It must be recognized that if we do not make the greatest effort now, we will not be able to complete this year's basic construction plan.

In order to complete this year's basic construction plan, from the leadership perspective, it is necessary to further strengthen specific leadership over basic construction. The central economic departments must assign leading cadres to take charge, immediately organize forces to conduct practical inspections of the construction situation, understand and resolve the problems existing in the work of various construction units, and pay special attention to inspecting the construction situation of important engineering projects, solving problems, overcoming difficulties, and ensuring the quality and progress of the projects. Party committees and governments at all levels should also mobilize and organize forces to earnestly inspect and supervise the progress of basic construction work in local state-owned enterprises. In particular, ensuring the completion of the construction of major projects should be regarded as their primary task, and the work of the Party, trade unions, and the Communist Youth League in construction units should be effectively strengthened, fighting against the phenomenon of no one being responsible for construction, against the bureaucratic style of construction management, and against the lack of attention to project quality and the phenomenon of waste in construction, to ensure the smooth progress of construction.

In order to complete this year's basic construction plan, all construction units should strive to improve construction management, establish and improve the responsibility system to eliminate the chaos on construction sites; at the same time, they should strengthen political work on the construction sites, fully mobilize the high enthusiasm and creativity of workers, and complete this year's tasks quickly, economically, and with guaranteed quality.

What are the main tasks for strengthening construction management?

First, it is necessary to establish and implement the technical responsibility system and strengthen technical management to ensure project quality. This is the primary task for improving construction management. Because ensuring project quality is the greatest economic accounting, and it is only on the premise of ensuring project quality that we can talk about striving for project progress.

To establish a relatively sound technical management system, it is first necessary to strictly control quality standards. The standards and basis for project quality are construction drawings and acceptance specifications. All construction sites should organize all employees to study drawings and acceptance specifications and strictly construct according to the drawings and specifications. Construction units should promptly accept completed sectional projects according to acceptance specifications, especially the concealed parts of the project. Secondly, it is necessary to carefully formulate and implement operating procedures. Without certain operating procedures, it is impossible to ensure certain project quality. Therefore, construction sites without operating procedures should formulate them immediately; construction sites with incomplete operating procedures should mobilize employees to discuss, absorb advanced experience from the masses, and supplement and revise them in a timely manner; construction sites with existing operating procedures must mobilize and educate employees to strictly abide by them, and have someone responsible for checking their implementation. Thirdly, it is necessary to establish and implement the technical responsibility system. There should be a technical person in charge of any construction site or section. Only in this way can we eliminate the phenomenon of no one being responsible for quality. At the same time, it is necessary to implement an inspection system. Construction units should establish technical inspection agencies to inspect and test project quality, and inspect and accept raw materials and semi-finished products. Design departments should send site technical supervisors to check whether the construction departments are constructing according to the design. In addition to sending people to supervise project quality at ordinary times, construction units should also conscientiously do a good job in project acceptance. Finally, it is also necessary to establish a mass quality responsibility system, launch a mass inspection campaign, and rely on the masses to consciously take responsibility, inspect and supervise each other to ensure the improvement of project quality. In addition to the above-mentioned basic responsibility systems, each enterprise needs to establish some necessary responsibility systems according to its own characteristics, such as the responsibility system for implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts.

Second, it is necessary to establish and implement a responsibility system to ensure construction progress, strengthen the planned management of construction, overcome the blindness and passivity in construction, and overcome the shortcomings of unclear responsibilities and unclose cooperation between construction units and construction units, to ensure the smooth progress of construction. The main contents of the construction responsibility system and planned management are: In order to ensure the timely delivery of design, equipment, materials and investment, the construction unit must carry out various balancing work on a monthly basis to connect it with the operation plan of the construction unit. The equipment supply department must complete the supply of equipment in a timely manner and effectively guarantee the quality of the equipment. Each construction unit must formulate correct operation plans on time, and establish indication charts as much as possible to guide the progress of the project and grasp the progress of the project on the site; establish necessary dispatching agencies and dispatching systems to supervise the implementation of operation plans, and through dispatching, continue to discover various phenomena of no one being responsible, and promote the establishment and implementation of other responsibility systems.

Third, a preliminary economic accounting system should be established. It is necessary to establish a budget and final accounts system, and according to the project budget, the construction unit and the construction unit shall sign a contract for contracting, which will be used as the basis for checking the cost of the project. It is necessary to improve the use of funds, mainly to handle the backlog of materials and equipment in a timely manner, so that it can be used reasonably and shorten the period of capital turnover. In view of the difficulty of building resources in our country at present, building materials should be well saved under the requirements of ensuring project quality. It is necessary to initially establish a financial accounting system, requiring both the construction site and the company to keep accounts to ensure that there is evidence to check, and to establish a foundation for financial management. Finally, original records should also be established. The head of the construction site, team, and group should report the attendance rate, the quantity of material consumption, etc. on a daily basis, and overcome and correct waste phenomena in a timely manner.

In order to do a good job in the above-mentioned management work and ensure the comprehensive completion of this year's basic construction plan well, quickly and economically, it is necessary to strengthen the political work on the construction site, strictly enforce labor discipline, and improve work efficiency. The political work on the construction site should aim at completing the construction task, strengthen the political education of employees, inspire the consciousness of the masses, and give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of workers, technicians, and employees; encourage them to actively put forward rationalization proposals, learn and promote advanced experience, especially advanced experience that has a significant effect; on the basis of improving the consciousness of employees, strictly enforce labor discipline, reduce and eliminate absenteeism and violations of labor discipline; and gradually rectify and consolidate the existing construction team; the working conditions and safety and welfare work of employees on the construction site must also be appropriately improved.

This year's basic construction task is arduous, but as long as we further strengthen the specific leadership of basic construction work without slackening, improve construction management, and further promote the enthusiasm and creativity of all workers, technicians, and employees, we have the confidence to strive to basically complete the basic construction plan for 1953 and create a good start for the country's five-year construction.

    努力完成今年的基本建设计划
    一九五三年是我国开始有计划的经济建设的第一年，国民经济各个方面都将在原有基础上有很大的发展。国民经济发展的最重要的标志之一，就是工业、交通运输、水利等事业的基本建设有很大的增长。今年，国家对基本建设的投资约占全部财政支出的三分之一。重大的建设项目共一百三十个：新建和改建七十五个工矿企业；十条铁路新线开始施工；公路的施工里程共五千余公里；水利方面继续根治淮河和永定河，并开始辽河和汉水的治本工程；教育方面新建钢铁、航空、石油、地质等学院；全国房屋的建筑面积共达二千七百万平方公尺。
    任何事情的开端往往是困难的，而且也是重要的，国家的基本建设也正是这样。一九五三年是我国五年建设计划的开端，今年的各项工程建设的好坏，完成得迟早，对我们胜利地实现五年建设计划有极其重大的作用，因此它也就特别显得重要。
    中央和毛主席从一九五二年下半年开始，就有预见地指示各经济部门、各省市党委和政府，必须加强对基本建设的领导；必须壮大基本建设力量，特别是集结和培养地质勘察和设计的力量；必须有计划有目的地扩大基本建设施工的队伍，主要是增强施工的技术力量。中央同时指出，在基本建设工作中，必须反对不量力而行，企图处处大规模、样样大规模等盲目冒进的情绪和倾向，必须认识基本建设的复杂性和艰巨性，既根据需要又根据可能，掌握重点建设的方针，切合实际地把基本建设放在可靠的基础上面。各个经济部门、各地党委和政府根据中央的上述方针，在一九五二年下半年开始就作了巨大的努力，进行了许多艰巨复杂的工作，因而使得我们在一九五三年的基本建设方面获得了很多成就。据检查，重工业、燃料、第一机械、第二机械、轻工业、纺织、铁道、交通、邮电、农业、水利等十一个部门，上半年完成了一九五三年基本建设计划工作量的百分之三十，在完成任务的比例和绝对数量上，与一九五二年同期比较有很大的增长，工程质量也有改进。
    我们在基本建设方面的成就，丝毫也不应该使我们有任何自满，有任何松懈。从现在到年底，施工时间只剩下四个月，在北方只有两个多月。在这个短促的时间内，要完成未完工程的工作量（约占全年计划的百分之五十以上），是十分艰巨的任务；同时，根据对上半年工作的检查，在我们的基本建设工作中仍存在着很多缺点甚至错误。例如某些部门编制计划时，盲目冒进的思想并未彻底克服，对重点建设的方针贯彻不够，对勘察、设计工作重视不足或努力不够，对设备、材料和技术力量、施工力量等，没有很好加以组织使之平衡，这些都影响到基本建设任务的完成。必须认识，如果我们现在不作最大的努力，那末，我们将还不能完成今年的基本建设计划。
    为了完成今年的基本建设计划，从领导方面说，必须进一步加强对基本建设的具体领导。中央各经济部门，必须由领导干部负责，立即组织力量，对施工情况进行切实的检查，了解和解决各个施工单位工作中存在的问题；并特别抓紧对重要工程项目施工情况的检查，解决问题，克服困难，保证完成工程质量和进度。各级党委和政府，同样应动员和组织力量，认真检查和监督当地国营企业基本建设工作进行的情况。特别应把保证完成重大工程的建设当作自己首要的任务，并切实加强建设单位中的党、工会和青年团的工作，向施工中无人负责的现象作斗争，向施工管理上的官僚主义作风作斗争，向不注意工程质量及施工中的浪费现象作斗争，以保证施工的顺利进行。
    为了完成今年的基本建设计划，施工各单位应努力改善施工管理，建立和健全责任制，以消除施工现场的混乱现象；同时应加强工地的政治工作，充分发挥职工高度的积极性和创造性，在保证工程质量的前提下，又快又省地完成今年的任务。
    加强施工管理，有那些主要工作要做呢？
    第一，要建立和贯彻技术责任制，加强技术管理，以保证工程质量。这是改善施工管理的首要任务。因为保证工程质量就是最大的经济核算，而且也只有在保证工程质量的前提下，才谈得上争取工程进度。
    要建立比较健全的技术管理制度，首先必须严格掌握质量标准。工程质量的标准和根据就是施工图纸和验收规范。各个工地都应组织全体职工学习图纸和验收规范，严格按照图纸和规范施工。建设单位应该按照验收规范及时验收完工的分部工程，特别是工程的隐蔽部分。其次，要认真制定和贯彻操作规程。没有一定的操作规程，就无法保证一定的工程质量。因此，没有操作规程的工地，应立即制订；操作规程不完备的工地，应发动职工讨论，吸收群众中的先进经验，及时补充和修正；已有操作规程的，必须动员和教育职工严格遵守，并由专人负责检查执行。再次，要建立和贯彻技术责任制。任何一个工地、工段，都要有技术上的负责人。只有这样，才能消灭质量上的无人负责现象。同时，要贯彻检验制度。施工单位要建立技术检查机构，检查和检验工程质量，并进行原材料、半成品的检查和验收。设计部门要派出工地技术监督人，检查施工部门是否按设计进行施工。建设单位除平时派人监督工程质量外，还应认真做好工程验收工作。最后，还要建立群众性的质量责任制，展开群众性的检查运动，依靠群众自觉地负责、相互检查和监督，来保证工程质量的提高。除上述这些基本的责任制度以外，各个企业还需要根据自己的特点，建立一些应有的责任制度，如贯彻苏联专家建议的责任制度等。
    第二，要建立和贯彻保证施工进度的责任制，加强施工的计划管理，克服施工中的盲目性和被动状况，克服建设单位和施工单位责任不明、配合不密切的缺点，以保证施工进度的顺利进行。施工责任制和计划管理的主要内容是：建设单位为了保证及时交付设计、设备、材料和投资，必须按月进行各种平衡工作，使之与施工单位的作业计划衔接起来。设备供应部门必须及时完成设备的供应，并切实保证设备的质量。各个施工单位必须按时制定正确的作业计划，并尽可能建立指示图表，以指导工程的进行，掌握现场的工程进度；建立必要的调度机构和调度制度，以监督作业计划的执行，并通过调度，继续发现各种无人负责现象，促进其他各种责任制度的建立和贯彻。
    第三，应建立初步的经济核算制。要建立预决算制度，并根据工程预算，由建设单位和施工单位订立包工合同，以此作为检查工程成本的依据。要改进资金运用情况，主要是及时处理积压的材料和设备，使之能够合理地运用，缩短资金周转的期限。鉴于我国目前建筑资源的困难，应在保证工程质量的要求下，很好地节约建筑材料。要初步建立财务会计制度，要求工地和公司两方面都记账，做到有据可查，为财务管理建立基础。最后，还要建立原始记录。工地的班、组长应按日报告出勤率、材料消耗数量等，及时克服和纠正浪费现象。
    为了做好上述各方面的管理工作，保证又好又快又省地全面完成今年的基本建设计划，必须加强工地的政治工作，严肃劳动纪律，以提高工作效率。工地的政治工作，应该以完成施工任务为目标，加强对职工的政治教育，启发群众的觉悟，发挥工人、技术人员和职员的积极性和创造性；鼓励他们积极提出合理化建议，学习和推广先进经验，特别是有重大作用的先进经验；在提高职工觉悟的基础上，严肃劳动纪律，减少和消除旷工和违犯劳动纪律的现象；并逐渐整顿和巩固现有的建筑队伍；对于工地的作业条件及职工的安全福利工作，也必须适当改善。
    今年基本建设的任务是艰巨的，但只要我们毫不松懈地进一步加强对基本建设工作的具体领导，改善施工管理，进一步发扬全体工人、技术人员和职员的积极性、创造性，我们有信心争取基本上完成一九五三年的基本建设计划，为国家的五年建设创造一个良好的开端。
