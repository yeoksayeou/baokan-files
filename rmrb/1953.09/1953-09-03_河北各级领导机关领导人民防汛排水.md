Since mid-August, Tianjin, Tongxian, Tangshan and other regions of Hebei Province have experienced continuous rain, causing some rivers to breach their banks and low-lying areas to flood, resulting in severe flooding in some areas. For example, in Tongxian County, the Tiantang River, Xiaolong River, Long River, and Feng River successively breached their banks, overflowing into the fields, with floodwaters generally ranging from one to three feet deep. Crops in the affected areas have suffered varying degrees of damage, and wheat planting has also been greatly hindered. Leaders at all levels in Hebei Province have paid close attention to leading the masses in flood control and drainage. When organizing farmers to fight the floods, cadres at all levels have conscientiously gone deep into the disaster-stricken areas to conduct detailed investigations and research, and then organized the masses to dig drainage ditches and repair water dikes according to the specific situation, so that many areas threatened by floods have been spared from disaster. Daxing County carried out drainage work according to the different terrain in various places, so that most of the areas suffering from floods in the county quickly drained the water. Jiahe County mobilized more than 20,000 people to repair dikes and embankments and fight floods with all their strength, and successively overcame the floods. The Hebei provincial leadership has taken emergency measures to lead the masses in production and disaster relief, and organized condolence groups from provincial-level agencies to go to various regions to express condolences, and assist local party and government leadership agencies in organizing the masses to rush to rescue and provide disaster relief, and further lead the masses to carry out a production self-rescue movement. The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China also convened a meeting of cadres from directly affiliated agencies on August 27 to mobilize party members and cadres to vigorously lead the masses to fight against disasters. Lin Tie, Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, pointed out in a report on Hebei Province's flood control, drainage, and disaster relief work at the meeting: The situation in rural areas of Hebei Province has undergone great changes in the past 20 days. Due to continuous heavy rainfall, some areas have suffered serious rain and river water disasters, some areas have had their crops flooded, and people's lives are facing great difficulties. He said: Leading agencies and leading cadres at all levels must clarify their leadership thinking and face the changed, new situation to plan their work. In areas where the disaster is serious, all work must be centered on production and disaster relief, and any work that hinders production and disaster relief should be stopped or postponed. Decentralism that disregards the overall interests is not allowed, nor is the phenomenon of stubbornly implementing plans that are no longer suitable for the new situation, regardless of the changed situation. Finally, Lin Tie called on all cadres sent to the countryside and party members and cadres in the disaster-stricken areas to work together with the people of all regions to overcome the disaster.

    河北各级领导机关领导人民防汛排水
    八月中旬以来，河北省天津、通县、唐山等专区阴雨连绵，以致有的河流决口，低洼地区内涝，部分地区造成了严重的水灾。如通县专区境内天堂河、小龙河、龙河、凤河连续决口，漫溢四野，被淹土地一般积水一尺到三尺深。遭灾地区各种庄稼遭到了不同程度的损害，种麦工作也受到了很大妨碍。河北省各地领导机关对于领导群众防洪排水的工作十分注意。各级干部在组织农民和洪水作斗争时，都认真深入到受灾的地方详细进行调查研究，然后根据具体情况，分别组织群众挖泄水沟，修整水堤，使许多遭受水灾威胁的地区，得免灾害。大兴县根据各地不同地形进行排水工作，使全县大部遭受水灾的地方很快把水泄出。交河县发动群众两万多人全力修补堤埝抢险，连续战胜洪水。河北省级领导机关，对于领导群众生产救灾工作，已经采取了紧急措施，由省级机关组织慰问团分赴各地区进行慰问，并协助各地党、政领导机关，组织群众抢险救灾，进一步领导群众开展生产自救运动。中共河北省委于八月二十七日并召开了直属机关干部大会，动员党员、干部大力领导群众向灾害作斗争。河北省委书记林铁在会上报告河北省的防汛、排水、救灾工作时指出：河北省农村的情况，二十多天来发生了很大变化，由于连降大雨，目前某些地区已受到了严重的雨水、河水灾害，有些地区庄稼被淹，人民生活面临着很大的困难。他说：各级领导机关、领导干部，一定要从领导思想上明确起来，务必面对着变化了的、新的情况，计划自己的工作。凡是灾情严重的地区，一切工作要围绕着生产救灾来进行，凡妨碍生产救灾的工作应停的停，应缓的缓，不允许有不顾整体利益的分散主义发生，也不允许有不顾变化了的情况，而固执地执行已不适合新情况的计划的现象。最后林铁号召所有下乡干部和各受灾地区的党员、干部，和各地人民同心协力，战胜灾害。
