    Shenyang Electrical Engineering Plant No. 5 Workers Welcome National Day
    Intensifying Trial Production of China's Largest Transformer
    To welcome National Day, workers at the Shenyang Electrical Engineering Plant No. 5 are currently intensifying the trial production of China's first and largest 13,500 kVA transformer. Its power transmission capacity can supply electricity for a large city with a population of one million or provide power for four heavy industrial factories each employing ten thousand workers.
    To ensure the early completion of this trial production task, the workers are enthusiastically launching a labor competition. In the competition, the marking group in the cold working workshop established a technology research association and launched a red flag competition among individuals. Hu Xianglin, a lathe operator in the trial production section of the metalworking workshop, improved his tools, increasing his daily output of wire clamps from thirty to eighty. Liu Fengzhen, a female worker in the insulation workshop, promptly resolved the critical issue of the shortage of 0.06 insulation paper, creating favorable conditions for the timely assembly of this large transformer.

    沈阳电工五厂职工迎接国庆节
    加紧试制我国最大的变压器
    沈阳市电工五厂职工为了迎接国庆节，现正加紧试制我国第一台最大的、一万三千五百千伏安的变压器。它的输电量可以供给有一百万人口大城市的用电，也可以供给四个有一万名工人的重工业工厂的动力用电。
    职工们为保证这个试制任务的提前完成，正热烈地展开劳动竞赛，在竞赛中冷作车间划线组的工人成立了技术研究会，并展开了个人之间的红旗竞赛；金工车间试制工段车工胡相林改进了工具，由每天做三十个线夹提高到八十个，绝缘车间女工刘凤珍及时解决了零点零六绝缘纸供不上的关键问题，为这台大变压器的按时装配创造了有利条件。（倪恩普）
