Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 11th: TASS Moscow, 10th, reported: "Izvestia" published an article by B. Bolotin and G. Kuzmin, commenting on the failure of the US economic blockade against People's China.

The article states: The trade blockade imposed by the United States on the People's Republic of China for more than two years has proven a complete failure. In fact, this blockade has been detrimental to the organizers themselves. The trade blockade has not been able to hinder the restoration and development of China's national economy, but has instead damaged the economies of those capitalist countries that have lost contact with the Chinese market.

The article points out that the severance of trade relations with China has intensified competition in the world capitalist market, especially in the Southeast Asian market. At the same time, the blockade against China is also detrimental to the economic situation in Indonesia, Malaya, Burma, and Ceylon. The reduction in rubber exports has left millions of farmers in these countries in a state of starvation.

Great Britain has encountered great difficulties in developing foreign trade. The loss of the Chinese market and the intensification of competition from the United States and Japan are the main reasons for the rapid decline in the export volume of British textiles and hardware.

The United States, disregarding the economic interests of other capitalist countries, implements a policy of blockading China, which has aroused growing dissatisfaction among commercial and industrial circles in these countries, especially since the People's Republic of China has repeatedly expressed its willingness to establish normal trade and economic relations with all capitalist countries. An increasing number of business people are demanding the lifting of the economic blockade. On the other hand, some capitalist countries, regardless of the blockade, have still established trade relations with China.

The failure of the economic blockade against People's China has angered the US reactionaries. The notorious Senator McCarthy has already demanded severe "punishment" for those countries that dare to trade with China. Many people in the US ruling clique support McCarthy. They are prepared to take all measures to sanction countries that break the blockade, from refusing to supply fuel to ships heading to China, to bombarding these ships on the high seas. However, in the United States, as in other countries, there are industrial and commercial circles who want to restore normal trade with countries in the peaceful and democratic camp.

Bolotin and Kuzmin concluded: It is clear that economic interests are more powerful than the political obstacles erected by the US ruling clique to oppose the normalization of international trade. The economic interests of most capitalist countries urgently demand the expansion of trade with the democratic camp, especially with the People's Republic of China.

    “消息报”发表波洛丁和库兹明的文章
    指出美国对我国进行的经济封锁已经失败
   【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十日讯：“消息报”登载了布·波洛丁和格·库兹明的一篇文章，评论美国对人民中国经济封锁的失败。
    文章写道：两年多以来美国对中华人民共和国实行的贸易封锁已经证明彻底失败了。事实上，这个封锁反而对组织封锁的人本身不利。贸易封锁并没有能阻挠中国国民经济的恢复和发展，反而损害了那些失去和中国市场的联系的资本主义国家的经济。
    文章指出，和中国贸易关系的断绝已使世界资本主义市场上的竞争，特别是在东南亚市场上的竞争，更尖锐化了。同时，对中国的封锁也对印度尼西亚、马来亚、缅甸和锡兰的经济局势不利。橡胶输出量的削减使这些国家内数以百万计的农民陷于饥饿状态。
    英国在发展对外贸易中，遇到了很大的困难。中国市场的丧失以及美国、日本的竞争的加剧，就是英国纺织品和五金商品输出量迅速下降的几个主要原因。
    美国不顾其他资本主义国家的经济利益实行封锁中国的政策，引起了这些国家商业界和工业界的日益增长的不满，尤其是因为中华人民共和国一再表明愿和一切资本主义国家建立正常的贸易关系和经济关系，越来越多的商业界人士要求取消经济封锁。另一方面，若干资本主义国家不顾封锁，仍和中国建立了贸易关系。
    对人民中国经济封锁的失败，激怒了美国反动分子。臭名昭彰的参议员麦卡锡，就已经要求严厉“惩罚”那些敢于和中国进行贸易的国家。在美国统治集团中有许多人支持麦卡锡。他们准备采取一切手段来制裁那些突破封锁的国家，从不供给驶向中国的船只以燃料起，直到在公海上炮轰这些船只为止。然而，在美国，也和在其他国家一样，有想和和平民主阵营各国恢复正常贸易的工商业界。
    波洛丁和库兹明最后写道：很明显，经济利益要比美国统治集团为反对国际贸易正常化而建立起来的政治障碍来得更有力。大多数资本主义国家的经济利益迫切要求扩大和民主阵营、特别是和中华人民共和国的贸易。
