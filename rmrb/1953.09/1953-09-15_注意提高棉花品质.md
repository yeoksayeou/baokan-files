    Pay Attention to Improving Cotton Quality
    In recent years, China's cotton production has greatly increased, and the quality has also been continuously improved. In 1952, the output of upland cotton with a lint length of more than one inch increased 3.6 times compared with 1950. Long-staple cotton, which China could not produce in the past, was also produced for spinning 60-count yarn. This is of great significance for improving the quality of textiles and meeting the needs of the people.
    However, the work of improving cotton quality is far less significant than the achievement of increasing cotton production. In 1952, the cotton purchased by the state was still mainly medium and sub-medium grade, and the amount of top-grade and sub-superior grade cotton was still very small. Artificial adulteration has been basically eliminated, but the content of impurities caused by rough ginning processing has not been reduced. More seriously, there is too much frost-damaged and immature yellow cotton. Taking the northern cotton area in 1952 as an example, the output of frost-damaged cotton generally accounted for 15 to 20 percent of the total output. Therefore, improving cotton quality is an extremely important task in future cotton production increase work.
    The experience of the state-owned Yellow River Flood Area Farm in improving cotton quality, published in this newspaper today, shows that as long as we pay attention to improving cotton quality during the production process, during the process of picking, collecting, and ginning cotton, the cotton grade can be rapidly improved. The cotton harvest season has arrived. Agricultural leading organs and scientific research institutions at all levels should learn from the experience of the Yellow River Flood Area Farm in improving cotton quality, and guide farms and farmers as well as processing plants to do a good job in this year's cotton harvesting and ginning work. At the same time, when summarizing the experience of increasing cotton production, pay attention to summarizing the experience of improving cotton quality, and guide cotton farmers to do a good job in improving cotton quality.

### 注意提高棉花品质

    注意提高棉花品质
    几年来，我国棉花产量有很大增加，品质也在不断提高。一九五二年绒长一英寸以上的细绒棉的产量，比一九五○年的产量增加到三点六倍，同时也生产了过去我国不能生产的纺六十支纱的长纤维棉花。这对改进纺织品质量和供应人民需要方面，有很重要的意义。
    但是提高棉花品质的工作还远不如增加棉花产量的成绩显著。一九五二年国家收购的棉花仍以中级及次中级棉花为大宗，上级及次优级的棉花数量还很少。人为的掺杂是基本消灭了，但由于轧花加工粗放所引起的杂质的含量并没有减少。更严重的是霜黄花和僵黄花的产量太多。以一九五二年北方棉区为例，霜黄花产量一般占总产量的百分之十五到二十。因此，提高棉花质量，乃是今后棉花增产工作中一项极重要的任务。
    今天本报发表的国营黄泛区农场提高棉花品质工作的经验，说明我们只要在生产过程中，在摘花、收花、轧花的过程中，注意提高棉花的质量，棉花品级是可以迅速提高的。目前已到棉花收获的季节，各级农业领导机关和科学研究机关应吸取黄泛区农场的提高棉花质量的经验，领导农场和农民群众以及加工厂做好今年的收花、轧花工作；同时在总结棉花的增产经验时，注意总结提高棉花品质的经验，领导棉农做好提高棉花质量的工作。
