Xinhua News Agency: New cotton from Hebei Province, a major cotton-producing area in China, has generally entered the market, and local cooperatives at all levels are now starting to purchase it. The Mancheng County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Baoding Prefecture has adopted the "supply and marketing mutual guarantee contract" method for purchasing this year. From August 11th to 24th, it has signed 146 contracts with agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, ordering 528,830 jin of seed cotton; and pre-ordering large quantities of fertilizer, salt, kerosene, coal, and various fabrics for cotton farmers. This method not only satisfies the cotton farmers but also ensures that the state purchases cotton in batches on schedule in a planned manner.

Before the new cotton purchase began, the relevant commercial departments in Hebei Province made full preparations. More than 1,600 cotton purchasing stations were established throughout the province, and 31 ginned cotton collection and transportation points were established. The Shijiazhuang area held a cotton processing conference to study the issue of improving processing technology. Cotton-producing areas have also added fire-fighting equipment and built simple warehouses and factories. The Provincial Cooperative Federation has allocated 75% of the cotton purchase funds for September to various cotton purchase stations.

In order to meet the needs of cotton farmers for various means of production and daily necessities after selling cotton, the Provincial People's Government Grain Bureau transferred a lot of coarse and fine food grains to cotton-producing areas at the end of August. The Hebei Provincial Cooperative Federation has prepared agricultural machinery, pesticides worth 21.7 billion yuan, 243 million jin of fertilizer, more than 270,000 tons of coal, and more than 360,000 bolts of cloth.

In order to cooperate with the purchase of new cotton, the Tianjin Purchasing and Supply Station of China National Merchandise Corporation has strengthened the supply of materials to the cotton-producing areas of Hebei Province. The daily necessities supplied by the station to the two major cotton-producing areas of Handan and Shijiazhuang are being transferred in a continuous stream. Some factories in Tianjin's machinery, cast iron, and wrought iron industries have signed ordering contracts for diesel engines, baling machines, leather shafts, belts, and cotton gin parts with 37 cooperatives in the cotton-producing areas of Hebei Province.

    河北省新棉普遍上市
    据新华社讯：我国主要棉花产区河北省新棉普遍上市，现在当地各级合作社正开始收购中。保定专区的满城县供销合作社今年采用了“供销互保结合合同”的收购方法。自八月十一日到二十四日已与农业生产合作社、互助组订妥合同一百四十六份，订购籽棉五十二万八千八百三十斤；预订给棉农大量的肥料、食盐、煤油、煤炭和各种布匹等。这种方法，不但棉农满意，也保证了国家有计划地按时将棉花成批购进。
    在新棉收购开始前，河北省各有关商业部门都作了充分的准备工作。全省设立了一千六百多个购棉站，建立了三十一个皮棉集运点。石家庄地区召开了棉花加工会议，研究了改进加工技术问题。各棉花产区，还增设了防火器材和修盖简单的仓库和厂房等。省合作总社，已把九月份购棉资金的百分之七十五拨到各购棉站。
    为了满足棉农售棉后对各种生产资料和生活资料的需要，省人民政府粮食厅在八月底就调了很多粗细食粮到产棉区。河北省合作总社准备了价值二百十七亿元的农械、农药和二亿四千三百万斤肥料、二十七万多吨煤，三十六万多匹布。
    为了配合新棉的收购工作，中国百货公司天津采购供应站加强了对河北省棉区的物资供应工作。该站供应邯郸、石家庄两个主要产棉地区的日用百货正在源源调拨。天津市机器、铸铁、锻铁等行业的部分工厂与河北省产棉区的三十七个合作社分别签订了柴油机、打包机、皮轴、线带及轧花机零件的订货合同。
