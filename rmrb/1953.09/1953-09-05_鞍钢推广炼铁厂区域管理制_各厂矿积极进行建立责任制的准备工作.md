Anshan Iron and Steel Promotes Regional Management System in Ironmaking Plant
Various Factories and Mines Actively Prepare to Establish Responsibility Systems

Anshan Iron and Steel Company, according to the instructions of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry, has decided to devote two and a half months to establish and improve the administrative responsibility system, focusing on promoting the experience of the ironmaking plant in implementing the production area management system.

Since the Anshan Iron and Steel Ironmaking Plant started operations in 1949, it has achieved some success in implementing democratic management. However, with the continuous development of production, many new problems have emerged in enterprise management. Due to unclear division of labor and ambiguous responsibilities, there was a serious phenomenon of no one being responsible; technical personnel did not dare to take bold responsibility; and various production units could not cooperate well. For example, the operation of the hot blast stove could disregard the command of the blast furnace; blast furnace operators could arbitrarily increase or decrease the temperature according to their personal intentions, without considering the operating conditions of the next shift; and tram maintenance could interrupt the supply of raw materials without notifying the blast furnace. These problems were concentrated in the lack of unified leadership in a production area and the lack of dedicated personnel responsible for various tasks, resulting in continuous responsibility accidents and hindering the development of production. In 1950, the plant only completed its production plan in eight months.

In order to reverse the chaotic state of production, the plant began to implement the production area management system in 1951. Under the leadership of the factory director responsibility system, a duty foreman system was first established in the entire plant's production area. The production of each shift was the full responsibility of a duty foreman, who directly led the deputy duty foreman (in charge of raw materials), blast furnace technicians, mud mixing foreman, iron casting foreman, dispatcher, etc., to carry out production. This eliminated the phenomenon of no one being responsible on the night shift, making each shift's production the responsibility of a dedicated person. Under the production area responsibility system, the plant unified the production leadership of the blast furnace. In the past, the blast furnace duty technician was only responsible for guiding the operation inside the blast furnace. The hot blast stove workers and pipe fitters, who should have been within the scope of the blast furnace team, were led by the foremen of the independent hot blast stove team and pipe fitting team, and the furnace front workers were led by the blast furnace foreman. If the entire blast furnace operation plan was not completed, no one was specifically responsible. When the plant implemented the regional responsibility system, according to the production characteristics of the blast furnace, it was decided that the blast furnace duty technician would be the overall person in charge of the blast furnace team, and would uniformly command the entire blast furnace work under the leadership of the duty foreman. This eliminated multiple leadership and changed the face of production.

In terms of technical management, the plant established a technical professional responsibility system. The formulation and revision of various professional operating procedures, technical education for employees, inspection of operating discipline, and safe production were all the responsibility of the respective professional technicians. Specialization allowed technical personnel to better study their work and improve their technical level. For example, the technicians responsible for gas work have created and promoted advanced production experiences such as the "furnace top ignition shutdown method," "reverse flow shutdown method," and "rapid combustion method" in the past two years; electrical professional technicians, with the help of Soviet experts, have improved and mastered the latest semi-automatic blast furnace equipment. The establishment of the technical professional responsibility system played a promoting and guaranteeing role in completing production tasks.

In addition, the plant also established a responsibility system for functional departments, a division of labor responsibility system for production teams (fixed worker operating positions), and responsibility systems for production scheduling and equipment management.

The result of the establishment and implementation of the responsibility system in the Anshan Iron and Steel Ironmaking Plant was the overcoming of the phenomenon of no one being responsible in production, the improvement of enterprise management, and significant achievements in increasing output and improving quality. The annual production task was completed 36 days ahead of schedule in 1951, the production task in 1952 was completed 5 days ahead of schedule, and the production task in the first half of this year was completed 17 days ahead of schedule. The steelmaking rate has increased year by year. Responsibility accidents have also been greatly reduced. Compared with April this year and April last year, material collapse accidents have decreased by 90%, and hanging material accidents have decreased by 85%.

The experience of this plant proves that establishing a responsibility system in production factories and mines is an effective way to overcome the phenomenon of no one being responsible and improve enterprise management. Currently, the experience of this plant in establishing a responsibility system is being widely promoted in various production factories and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel. (Xue Enqin)

Xinhua News Agency - Anshan, 
The state-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company's various production plants and mines are actively preparing for the establishment and improvement of responsibility systems. Leading cadres, technical personnel, and staff in the various plants and mines, after a period of learning and deliberation, have universally recognized the importance of establishing and improving the responsibility system. Leading cadres from several plants, such as the Chemical Plant and the Cast Pipe Plant, have already begun to conduct experiments in key workshops to establish the responsibility system. Some factories, in conducting key experiments, have identified some problems that hinder the implementation of work plans due to no one being responsible, and have initially determined the responsibilities of certain organizations and individuals. Currently, more than 20 units, including the Ironmaking Plant, the Steelmaking Plant, and the Gongchangling Iron Mine, have formulated specific plans and schedules for the central tasks in the second half of the year based on the instructions of higher authorities and the specific conditions of their units, and have proposed specific methods to solve key production problems in the plans. The Steelmaking Plant plans to further guarantee the production of steel according to variety and reduce costs through the establishment of various responsibility systems. In order to implement the production area management system, the plant first further clarified the responsibilities of the duty foreman. During the duty time, the duty foreman uniformly leads the production of the open hearth furnace, the agglomeration, the transportation, and the raw materials workshops. The Communist Party, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League organizations of the plant have also changed their organizational forms to adapt to the requirements of the production area management system in the administrative aspect. In the past, these organizations were formed on a workshop basis, and there were no Party or trade union cadres working on the site at night. Now these organizations are formed according to Class A, B, and C shifts, and cadres are working during the day or night shifts, thus strengthening the Party's guarantee and supervision role in the grassroots production organizations, and the mass work is also more in-depth.

In order to lay a good foundation for the establishment of the responsibility system in the future, the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently inspected the preparations of the various plants and mines. During the inspection, it was found that the leading cadres of a few plants and mines had not studied the documents well and formulated specific work steps, but had hastily arranged the work of establishing the responsibility system to the workers and masses, which caused some erroneous understanding among many workers. For this reason, the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China requires that before establishing the responsibility system, the Party Committee must well organize cadres, technical personnel, and staff to study the relevant guiding documents and fully prepare for the establishment of the responsibility system.

    鞍钢推广炼铁厂区域管理制
    各厂矿积极进行建立责任制的准备工作
    鞍山钢铁公司根据中央重工业部的指示精神，决定以两个半月的时间来建立与健全行政责任制，着重推广炼铁厂实行生产区域管理制的经验。
    鞍钢炼铁厂从一九四九年开工以后，在实行民主管理上曾收到一些成绩。但随着生产的不断发展，在企业管理上又出现了许多新的问题。由于分工不明、职责不清，存在着严重的无人负责现象；技术人员不敢大胆负责；各生产单位不能很好配合。如热风炉的工作可以不听高炉的指挥；高炉操作人员可以按着个人意图随便增加或减少温度，不考虑下班操作人员的操作条件；电车检修时可以不通知高炉就中断了原料的供给。这些问题集中表现在一个生产区域缺乏统一的领导，各项工作无专人负责，因而责任事故不断发生，阻碍着生产的发展。在一九五○年，该厂只有八个月完成了生产计划。
    为扭转生产中的混乱状态，该厂从一九五一年开始实行生产区域管理制。在厂长负责制之下，首先在全厂生产区域建立值班长制度，每一轮班的生产由一个值班长负完全责任，他直接领导副值班长（管原料）、各高炉技术员，碾泥班长、铸铁班长、调度员等进行生产。这样就消灭了夜班的无人负责现象，使每一轮班的生产都有专人负责。在生产区域责任制之下，该厂统一了高炉的生产领导。过去高炉值班技术员仅负责指导高炉内的操作，应属高炉小组范围的热风炉工人与配管工人，都由独立的热风炉班与配管班的班长领导，炉前工人则由高炉班长领导。整个高炉作业计划完不成则无专人负责。该厂实行区域专责制时，根据高炉的生产性质，决定高炉值班技术员为高炉小组的全面负责人，在值班长的领导下统一指挥整个高炉的工作。从而消灭了多头的领导，改变了生产面貌。
    在技术管理方面，该厂建立了技术专业责任制。各专业操作规程的拟订与修正，职工技术教育，操作纪律的检查，以及安全生产等，都由各专业技术员负责。专业化的结果，使技术人员有可能更好地钻研业务，提高了技术水平。如负责瓦斯工作的技术人员，两年多来创造与推广了“炉顶点火休风法”、“倒流休风法”、“快速燃烧法”等先进生产经验；电气专职技术人员在苏联专家帮助下，改进与掌握了最新式的半自动化高炉设备。技术专业责任制的建立，对完成生产任务起了推动与保证作用。
    此外，该厂还建立了职能机构的责任制，生产小组分工负责制（固定工人操作岗位），以及生产调度、设备管理等责任制度。
    鞍钢炼铁厂建立与贯彻责任制的结果，克服了生产中的无人负责现象，改善了企业管理，在增加产量与提高质量方面都有显著成绩。一九五一年提前三十六天完成全年生产任务，一九五二年的生产任务提前五天完成，今年上半年的生产任务提前十七天完成，制钢铁率逐年上升。责任事故也大大减少，以今年四月份与去年四月份比较，崩料事故减少了百分之九十，悬料事故减少了百分之八十五。
    该厂经验证明，在生产厂矿中建立责任制是克服无人负责现象、改善企业管理的有效办法。目前，该厂建立责任制的经验，正在鞍钢各生产厂矿中普遍推广。    （薛恩勤）
    国营鞍山钢铁公司所属各生产厂矿正在积极进行建立和健全责任制的准备工作。各厂矿的领导干部、技术人员和职员，经过一定时期的学习酝酿，已普遍认识到建立与健全责任制的重要性。化工和铸管等几个厂的领导干部，已开始深入重点车间进行建立责任制的试验。有些工厂在进行重点试验中，检查出了一些因无人负责而阻碍贯彻作业计划的问题，并初步确定了某些机构和个人的职责。目前，炼铁厂、炼钢厂和弓长岭铁矿等二十多个单位，根据上级指示和本单位的具体情况，拟定了下半年中心工作的具体计划与进度，并在计划中提出了解决生产关键问题的具体办法。炼钢厂计划通过各种责任制的建立，进一步保证按品种出钢和降低成本。该厂为了贯彻生产区域管理制，首先进一步明确了值班长的职责。在值班时间内，值班长统一领导平炉、造块、运转、原料等四个车间的生产。该厂的共产党、工会和青年团组织，为了适应行政方面生产区域管理制的要求，也改变了组织形式。过去这些组织是以车间为单位组成的，夜间现场里没有党或工会干部进行工作。现在这些组织按照甲、乙、丙三班组成，日班或夜班都有干部进行工作，因而加强了党在基层生产组织中的保证与监督作用，群众工作也更深入了。
    为了给今后建立责任制的工作打好基础，中共鞍山市委最近检查了各厂矿的准备工作。在检查中，发现少数厂矿的领导干部没有很好学习文件和拟定具体的工作步骤，就草率地向职工群众布置了建立责任制的工作，因而使许多职工产生了一些错误的认识。为此，中共鞍山市委要求各厂矿在建立责任制以前，党委要很好地组织干部、技术人员和职员学习有关的指示文件，充分地做好建立责任制的准备工作。    （新华社）
