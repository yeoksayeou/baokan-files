    The Japanese Workers' Movement Since This Spring
    Feng Zhidan
    Under the rule of the American occupation forces and the Yoshida traitorous clique, the Japanese working class and other working people are facing a serious threat of poverty and starvation. Due to the deepening of the economic crisis in Japan, many factories have reduced production or closed down, and a large number of workers have been laid off. According to the greatly reduced figures in the recent labor "White Paper" published by the Yoshida government, the number of unemployed workers has reached more than 4 million, an increase of more than 1 million compared with the same period last year; plus the number of semi-unemployed, the total is 13 million, accounting for about one-sixth of the total population of Japan. The actual wages of workers are constantly decreasing, and working hours are generally extended to about twelve hours. Attacked by the increasingly serious crisis in all aspects of the social economy, the living conditions of the broad masses of Japanese working people are deteriorating.
    Since the fifth time Yoshida government came to power, the US-Japan reactionaries have been more and more frantically pushing forward the policy of rearmament and colonial enslavement in Japan. In order to clear the obstacles for the United States to rearm Japan, the Yoshida government recently passed militarized financial budgets and fascist laws such as the "Anti-Strike Law". The US government is also negotiating a highly unequal transaction with Yoshida, attempting to further enslave the Japanese people with military "aid" from the "Mutual Security Agency." Japan's national crisis is deepening. Under such circumstances, in order to fight for independence, peace, and democracy, and to fight for their own living rights, the Japanese working class, under the leadership of the Japanese Communist Party, is carrying out an unyielding struggle against the US-Japan reactionaries. Following the five major strikes by millions of Japanese workers in 1952 against the "Anti-Subversive Activities Act", the historic "May Day" demonstrations, and the coal and electricity strikes in the second half of the year, the Japanese workers' movement has seen new developments since this spring.
    In March, 80,000 transport workers of Japan Express Co. launched a six-day strike across the country, demanding that the base wage be increased from 12,800 yen to 24,000 yen, causing more than 18,000 freight cars of the national railway to stop running and 60 percent of freight transport to be suspended. Subsequently, 100,000 steelworkers and the Federation of Private Railway Workers' Unions and the Synthetic Chemical Industry Workers' Union held a unified strike. Coupled with the strikes of workers in the vehicle, shipbuilding, and machinery industries, a spring strike wave demanding wage increases was formed. At the same time, workers, mainly from unions such as "Teikoku Coal," "Kanto Steel," and "Showa Denko Kawasaki Factory," also launched strikes against layoffs and against reducing labor conditions. When the Yoshida government returned to power in May, workers at Oji Paper Co., the largest paper company in Japan, and Honshu Paper Co. launched a strike to demand wage increases. The workers at Oji Paper Co. persisted in their strike for three weeks, causing the capitalists to suffer losses of 154 million yen and reducing the number of pages in newspapers across Japan by twelve pages per week, finally forcing the monopoly capitalists to accept some of the workers' demands. Six thousand workers at the Akabane factory of Japan Steel Works in Tokyo, which is managed by the US military, could not tolerate the barbaric exploitation and enslavement by the US military authorities and Japanese military-industrial tycoons. Ignoring the prohibitions and the threats from the 600 armed thugs sent by the US military authorities to supervise production, they began a strike on June 16, demanding a wage increase of 4,000 yen. Although the striking workers were immediately subjected to bloody suppression by the US military authorities, they still persevered heroically until victory. Japanese public education personnel, who were deprived of the right to strike by the Yoshida government, also launched a campaign to demand summer allowances from the Yoshida government in the face of deteriorating living conditions and rising prices, holding demonstrations with tens of thousands of people. These struggles to fight for the right to live almost swept across all industrial sectors in Japan. Many unions, such as Japan Express Co. and the Steelworkers' Union, which had rarely participated in strikes in the past, have now participated in unified strikes in their respective industries. The Japanese working class's strike movement has severely hit the US-Japan reactionaries' war preparation policy. At the same time, more and more Japanese working people have realized the truth in the struggle for the right to live: only by striving for Japan's independence, peace, and democracy can their living conditions be fundamentally improved.
    With the increase in the political consciousness of the Japanese working class, they have launched increasingly sharp political struggles against the US-Japan reactionaries and have become the leading force in the political life of the Japanese people. They have answered the absurd argument of the right-wing Socialist Party splitters about "less involvement in politics" with practical actions. At the beginning of this year, the Japanese working class launched an offensive against Yoshida's fourth traitorous cabinet. On February 28, Japanese youth refused to be cannon fodder and held a mass rally in Tokyo against conscription, striking at Yoshida's conspiracy to restore the militarist conscription system. Japanese young workers were the backbone of this movement. On March 14, more than 30,000 workers held a large demonstration in Tokyo to oppose the Yoshida government's enactment of fascist laws such as the Anti-Strike Law. When the workers' ranks held a rally in Hibiya Park, a large number of US military police and Japanese police guarded the surrounding area, but the workers, holding placards reading "American soldiers get out" and "Down with the Yoshida government," broke through the cordon and held a demonstration in downtown Tokyo, distributing leaflets along the way, demanding peace, opposing rearmament, and opposing the pro-US, traitorous Yoshida government. On this very day, the Yoshida cabinet fell. The frequent demonstrations and protests by the people of all strata, led by the working class, had a huge impact on the Japanese political situation and became an important factor in the collapse of the fourth Yoshida cabinet. Subsequently, in the April general election, the Japanese working class and the Japanese people, under extremely undemocratic election conditions, further weakened the forces of the reactionary parties in the parliament, hitting the US imperialists' conspiracy to establish a stable conservative regime in Japan. After the fifth Yoshida cabinet came to power on May 21, it resubmitted the "Anti-Strike Law" to the Diet on June 14. The Japanese working class immediately responded with powerful counterattacks through practical actions such as strikes. On June 20, mass rallies against the Anti-Strike Law, demanding summer allowances, and demanding wage increases were held across Japan. One and a half million people participated in this nationwide struggle. On July 4, three million Japanese workers held scheduled strikes and protest rallies in various places. The Yoshida government ignored the strong protests of the Japanese working class and forcibly passed the "Anti-Strike Law" in the Japanese House of Representatives on July 11. On the same day, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) called on its three million members to hold a second nationwide general strike. Prior to this, Yoshida government's Minister of Justice, Ken Inukai, and Minister of Labor, Zentar≈ç Kosaka, had made threatening remarks, warning workers not to hold strikes to oppose the "Anti-Strike Law"; however, 270,000 coal miners held a 24-hour strike, electrical industry workers across Japan cut off power to large factories, and workers in key industrial sectors such as metal mines, shipbuilding, chemical industry, steel, and automobiles held protest strikes one after another. On July 27, "Sohyo" held the third protest struggle, including strikes, as scheduled, with three million workers participating in this struggle, demonstrating the unwavering will of the Japanese working class to fight for democratic rights.
    Inspired and influenced by the Japanese workers' movement, a struggle to cancel the US military base, centered on Uchinada Village in Ishikawa Prefecture, is unfolding throughout Japan. The struggle in Uchinada Village is a broad mass struggle with workers, peasants, and fishermen as the backbone, including all other strata and some people from bourgeois political parties. Following the refusal of military transportation by the Hokuriku Railway workers, the Ishikawa Prefecture Electric Power Workers' Union and the National Railway Workers' Union also successively resolved to refuse military power supply and military transportation, supporting the struggle in Uchinada Village. The struggle of the Japanese people against the militarization of national territory will continue to give the US warmongers and their running dog, the Yoshida traitorous government, an even heavier blow.
    In the course of its development, the Japanese workers' movement is overcoming numerous obstacles and gradually moving towards the road of unity. More and more Japanese workers have recognized the deception and reactionary nature of the right-wing Socialist Party splitters from the struggle, and resolutely safeguard the unity and united action of the working class.
    The Japanese working class is closely vigilant against the conspiracy of the right-wing splitters to drag the Japanese trade union into the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" and to promote "international neutrality" in order to undermine the great unity of the Japanese working class and the workers of the Soviet Union, China, and the world. From its third congress to its fourth congress, "Sohyo" has consistently adhered to the resolution to refuse to participate in the imperialist tool, the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions." Various trade union organizations that had participated in the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" have also successively resolved to withdraw from this international bourgeois front organization. The National Railway Workers' Union of Japan, with 400,000 members, passed a resolution at its national congress in June to formally withdraw from the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions"; the Private Railway Workers' Union, with 110,000 members, also made the same resolution at its third national congress. At its sixth national congress held on May 21, the All-Japan Telecommunications Workers' Union rejected the proposal of right-wing elements to join the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions." Many Japanese trade union organizations have already or are in the process of breaking through the obstruction of right-wing upper-level elements and severing ties with the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions." The leadership of the Electrical Industry, Tokyo Electric Power Company, and Yawata Iron Works of Japan Steel Industry, etc., has long been controlled by right-wing elements, but due to the fierce opposition of the grassroots masses, they have also successively revised their economicism and trade unionism work programs. All of these have great significance for the development of the Japanese workers' movement.
    In order to further split "Sohyo," the US-Japan reactionaries instigated their agents to form the "National Council for Liaison on Democratic Labor Movements" (Minroren) in February of this year. This organization, echoing the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" internally and externally, attempted to oppose the political struggle of Japanese workers to fight for survival and democratic rights, and to split the united action of the working class. However, the splitting conspiracy of the US-Japan reactionaries cannot hinder the high tide of the Japanese workers' movement. Since this spring, regional and industrial unified strikes have become a common phenomenon. This shows the increasing strengthening of the united action of the Japanese working class. At the Fourth National Congress of "Sohyo" held from July 8 to 11 this year, the progressive forces once again defeated the splitting activities of the right-wing elements, enabling the congress to successfully pass a series of progressive resolutions such as overthrowing the Yoshida cabinet, supporting the peace movement, opposing Japan's acceptance of the US "Mutual Security Agency" aid, holding "Peace Month," supporting the struggle to cancel military bases such as in Uchinada Village, and opposing the Anti-Strike Law. Obviously, the US-Japan reactionaries are unwilling to give up their conspiracy to split and suppress the workers' movement. Recently, they are still carrying out activities against certain trade union organizations belonging to "Sohyo," attempting to weaken and split "Sohyo." However, any acts of violence and despicable fraudulent means by the ruling class can only make the Japanese working class more vigilant and strengthen the great unity within the working class and with the entire people.
    Currently, the Japanese workers' movement is moving towards a new high tide. The Japan Coal Miners' Union, with 270,000 members, is currently brewing a large-scale strike to counter the so-called "production rationalization" of the coal industry monopoly capitalists, which involves massive layoffs of workers. The struggle of Nissan Motor Co. workers to demand summer allowances since June is still developing. The 150,000 Japanese workers employed by the US military in Japan held a 48-hour general strike starting on August 12, actively cooperating with the struggle of the entire Japanese people against military bases. These actions demonstrate the powerful strength of the Japanese working class. As the Japanese "Akahata" pointed out in its editorial on July 15 regarding the current situation of the Japanese working class struggle: The Japanese workers' movement is entering "a new stage of leapfrog development."
