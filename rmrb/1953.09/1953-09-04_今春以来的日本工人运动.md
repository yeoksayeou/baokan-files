    The Japanese Workers' Movement Since This Spring
    Feng Zhidan
    Under the rule of the American occupation forces and the Yoshida traitorous clique, the Japanese working class and other working people are facing a serious threat of poverty and starvation. Due to the deepening of the economic crisis in Japan, many factories have reduced production or closed down, and a large number of workers have been laid off. According to the greatly reduced figures in the recent labor "White Paper" published by the Yoshida government, the number of unemployed workers has reached more than 4 million, an increase of more than 1 million compared with the same period last year; plus the number of semi-unemployed, the total is 13 million, accounting for about one-sixth of the total population of Japan. The actual wages of workers are constantly decreasing, and working hours are generally extended to about twelve hours. Attacked by the increasingly serious crisis in all aspects of the social economy, the living conditions of the broad masses of Japanese working people are deteriorating.
    Since the fifth time Yoshida government came to power, the US-Japan reactionaries have been more and more frantically pushing forward the policy of rearmament and colonial enslavement in Japan. In order to clear the obstacles for the United States to rearm Japan, the Yoshida government recently passed militarized financial budgets and fascist laws such as the "Anti-Strike Law". The US government is also negotiating a highly unequal transaction with Yoshida, attempting to further enslave the Japanese people with military "aid" from the "Mutual Security Agency." Japan's national crisis is deepening. Under such circumstances, in order to fight for independence, peace, and democracy, and to fight for their own living rights, the Japanese working class, under the leadership of the Japanese Communist Party, is carrying out an unyielding struggle against the US-Japan reactionaries. Following the five major strikes by millions of Japanese workers in 1952 against the "Anti-Subversive Activities Act", the historic "May Day" demonstrations, and the coal and electricity strikes in the second half of the year, the Japanese workers' movement has seen new developments since this spring.
    In March, 80,000 transport workers of Japan Express Co. launched a six-day strike across the country, demanding that the base wage be increased from 12,800 yen to 24,000 yen, causing more than 18,000 freight cars of the national railway to stop running and 60 percent of freight transport to be suspended. Subsequently, 100,000 steelworkers and the Federation of Private Railway Workers' Unions and the Synthetic Chemical Industry Workers' Union held a unified strike. Coupled with the strikes of workers in the vehicle, shipbuilding, and machinery industries, a spring strike wave demanding wage increases was formed. At the same time, workers, mainly from unions such as "Teikoku Coal," "Kanto Steel," and "Showa Denko Kawasaki Factory," also launched strikes against layoffs and against reducing labor conditions. When the Yoshida government returned to power in May, workers at Oji Paper Co., the largest paper company in Japan, and Honshu Paper Co. launched a strike to demand wage increases. The workers at Oji Paper Co. persisted in their strike for three weeks, causing the capitalists to suffer losses of 154 million yen and reducing the number of pages in newspapers across Japan by twelve pages per week, finally forcing the monopoly capitalists to accept some of the workers' demands. Six thousand workers at the Akabane factory of Japan Steel Works in Tokyo, which is managed by the US military, could not tolerate the barbaric exploitation and enslavement by the US military authorities and Japanese military-industrial tycoons. Ignoring the prohibitions and the threats from the 600 armed thugs sent by the US military authorities to supervise production, they began a strike on June 16, demanding a wage increase of 4,000 yen. Although the striking workers were immediately subjected to bloody suppression by the US military authorities, they still persevered heroically until victory. Japanese public education personnel, who were deprived of the right to strike by the Yoshida government, also launched a campaign to demand summer allowances from the Yoshida government in the face of deteriorating living conditions and rising prices, holding demonstrations with tens of thousands of people. These struggles to fight for the right to live almost swept across all industrial sectors in Japan. Many unions, such as Japan Express Co. and the Steelworkers' Union, which had rarely participated in strikes in the past, have now participated in unified strikes in their respective industries. The Japanese working class's strike movement has severely hit the US-Japan reactionaries' war preparation policy. At the same time, more and more Japanese working people have realized the truth in the struggle for the right to live: only by striving for Japan's independence, peace, and democracy can their living conditions be fundamentally improved.
    With the increase in the political consciousness of the Japanese working class, they have launched increasingly sharp political struggles against the US-Japan reactionaries and have become the leading force in the political life of the Japanese people. They have answered the absurd argument of the right-wing Socialist Party splitters about "less involvement in politics" with practical actions. At the beginning of this year, the Japanese working class launched an offensive against Yoshida's fourth traitorous cabinet. On February 28, Japanese youth refused to be cannon fodder and held a mass rally in Tokyo against conscription, striking at Yoshida's conspiracy to restore the militarist conscription system. Japanese young workers were the backbone of this movement. On March 14, more than 30,000 workers held a large demonstration in Tokyo to oppose the Yoshida government's enactment of fascist laws such as the Anti-Strike Law. When the workers' ranks held a rally in Hibiya Park, a large number of US military police and Japanese police guarded the surrounding area, but the workers, holding placards reading "American soldiers get out" and "Down with the Yoshida government," broke through the cordon and held a demonstration in downtown Tokyo, distributing leaflets along the way, demanding peace, opposing rearmament, and opposing the pro-US, traitorous Yoshida government. On this very day, the Yoshida cabinet fell. The frequent demonstrations and protests by the people of all strata, led by the working class, had a huge impact on the Japanese political situation and became an important factor in the collapse of the fourth Yoshida cabinet. Subsequently, in the April general election, the Japanese working class and the Japanese people, under extremely undemocratic election conditions, further weakened the forces of the reactionary parties in the parliament, hitting the US imperialists' conspiracy to establish a stable conservative regime in Japan. After the fifth Yoshida cabinet came to power on May 21, it resubmitted the "Anti-Strike Law" to the Diet on June 14. The Japanese working class immediately responded with powerful counterattacks through practical actions such as strikes. On June 20, mass rallies against the Anti-Strike Law, demanding summer allowances, and demanding wage increases were held across Japan. One and a half million people participated in this nationwide struggle. On July 4, three million Japanese workers held scheduled strikes and protest rallies in various places. The Yoshida government ignored the strong protests of the Japanese working class and forcibly passed the "Anti-Strike Law" in the Japanese House of Representatives on July 11. On the same day, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) called on its three million members to hold a second nationwide general strike. Prior to this, Yoshida government's Minister of Justice, Ken Inukai, and Minister of Labor, Zentarō Kosaka, had made threatening remarks, warning workers not to hold strikes to oppose the "Anti-Strike Law"; however, 270,000 coal miners held a 24-hour strike, electrical industry workers across Japan cut off power to large factories, and workers in key industrial sectors such as metal mines, shipbuilding, chemical industry, steel, and automobiles held protest strikes one after another. On July 27, "Sohyo" held the third protest struggle, including strikes, as scheduled, with three million workers participating in this struggle, demonstrating the unwavering will of the Japanese working class to fight for democratic rights.
    Inspired and influenced by the Japanese workers' movement, a struggle to cancel the US military base, centered on Uchinada Village in Ishikawa Prefecture, is unfolding throughout Japan. The struggle in Uchinada Village is a broad mass struggle with workers, peasants, and fishermen as the backbone, including all other strata and some people from bourgeois political parties. Following the refusal of military transportation by the Hokuriku Railway workers, the Ishikawa Prefecture Electric Power Workers' Union and the National Railway Workers' Union also successively resolved to refuse military power supply and military transportation, supporting the struggle in Uchinada Village. The struggle of the Japanese people against the militarization of national territory will continue to give the US warmongers and their running dog, the Yoshida traitorous government, an even heavier blow.
    In the course of its development, the Japanese workers' movement is overcoming numerous obstacles and gradually moving towards the road of unity. More and more Japanese workers have recognized the deception and reactionary nature of the right-wing Socialist Party splitters from the struggle, and resolutely safeguard the unity and united action of the working class.
    The Japanese working class is closely vigilant against the conspiracy of the right-wing splitters to drag the Japanese trade union into the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" and to promote "international neutrality" in order to undermine the great unity of the Japanese working class and the workers of the Soviet Union, China, and the world. From its third congress to its fourth congress, "Sohyo" has consistently adhered to the resolution to refuse to participate in the imperialist tool, the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions." Various trade union organizations that had participated in the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" have also successively resolved to withdraw from this international bourgeois front organization. The National Railway Workers' Union of Japan, with 400,000 members, passed a resolution at its national congress in June to formally withdraw from the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions"; the Private Railway Workers' Union, with 110,000 members, also made the same resolution at its third national congress. At its sixth national congress held on May 21, the All-Japan Telecommunications Workers' Union rejected the proposal of right-wing elements to join the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions." Many Japanese trade union organizations have already or are in the process of breaking through the obstruction of right-wing upper-level elements and severing ties with the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions." The leadership of the Electrical Industry, Tokyo Electric Power Company, and Yawata Iron Works of Japan Steel Industry, etc., has long been controlled by right-wing elements, but due to the fierce opposition of the grassroots masses, they have also successively revised their economicism and trade unionism work programs. All of these have great significance for the development of the Japanese workers' movement.
    In order to further split "Sohyo," the US-Japan reactionaries instigated their agents to form the "National Council for Liaison on Democratic Labor Movements" (Minroren) in February of this year. This organization, echoing the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" internally and externally, attempted to oppose the political struggle of Japanese workers to fight for survival and democratic rights, and to split the united action of the working class. However, the splitting conspiracy of the US-Japan reactionaries cannot hinder the high tide of the Japanese workers' movement. Since this spring, regional and industrial unified strikes have become a common phenomenon. This shows the increasing strengthening of the united action of the Japanese working class. At the Fourth National Congress of "Sohyo" held from July 8 to 11 this year, the progressive forces once again defeated the splitting activities of the right-wing elements, enabling the congress to successfully pass a series of progressive resolutions such as overthrowing the Yoshida cabinet, supporting the peace movement, opposing Japan's acceptance of the US "Mutual Security Agency" aid, holding "Peace Month," supporting the struggle to cancel military bases such as in Uchinada Village, and opposing the Anti-Strike Law. Obviously, the US-Japan reactionaries are unwilling to give up their conspiracy to split and suppress the workers' movement. Recently, they are still carrying out activities against certain trade union organizations belonging to "Sohyo," attempting to weaken and split "Sohyo." However, any acts of violence and despicable fraudulent means by the ruling class can only make the Japanese working class more vigilant and strengthen the great unity within the working class and with the entire people.
    Currently, the Japanese workers' movement is moving towards a new high tide. The Japan Coal Miners' Union, with 270,000 members, is currently brewing a large-scale strike to counter the so-called "production rationalization" of the coal industry monopoly capitalists, which involves massive layoffs of workers. The struggle of Nissan Motor Co. workers to demand summer allowances since June is still developing. The 150,000 Japanese workers employed by the US military in Japan held a 48-hour general strike starting on August 12, actively cooperating with the struggle of the entire Japanese people against military bases. These actions demonstrate the powerful strength of the Japanese working class. As the Japanese "Akahata" pointed out in its editorial on July 15 regarding the current situation of the Japanese working class struggle: The Japanese workers' movement is entering "a new stage of leapfrog development."

    今春以来的日本工人运动
    冯之丹
    在美国占领军及吉田卖国集团的统治下，日本工人阶级和其他劳动人民，正面临严重的穷困与饥饿的威胁。由于日本经济危机日益加深，许多工厂减产或倒闭，大批工人被解雇。根据吉田政府新近发表的劳工“白皮书”中大大缩小的数字，工人失业人数已达四百余万，较去年同期增加了一百多万；加上半失业的数字，则达一千三百万人，约占日本总人口的六分之一。工人的实际工资不断降低，工作时间一般延长到十二小时左右。在社会经济的各个方面，都遭受着日益严重的危机的袭击，日本广大劳动人民的生活条件是越来越恶化了。
    吉田政府第五次上台后，美日反动派越来越疯狂地在日本推行重整军备和殖民地奴役的政策。吉田政府为了给美国重新武装日本扫清障碍，最近通过了军事化的财政预算及“禁止罢工法”等法西斯法令。美国政府并和吉田谈判着一宗极不等价的交易，企图以“共同安全署”的军事性的“援助”，进一步奴役日本人民。日本的民族危机正日益加深。在这种情况下，日本工人阶级为了争取独立、和平与民主，为了争取自己的生活权利，在日本共产党领导下，正和美日反动派进行着不屈不挠的斗争。继一九五二年数百万日本工人举行了反对“防止破坏活动法案”的五次大罢工、历史性的“五一”大示威以及下半年煤业、电业大罢工之后，日本工人运动自今春以来又有了新的发展。
    三月间，日本通运公司八万运输工人为要求将基准工资从一万二千八百日元增加到二万四千日元，在全国范围内掀起了罢工六天的斗争，使一万八千余辆国营铁道的货车停驶，百分之六十的货运陷于停顿。接着十万钢铁工人及私营铁道工会、合成化学产业工会联合会举行了统一罢工，加上车辆、造船、机器等产业工人的罢工，便形成了春季要求提高工资的罢工浪潮。同时，以“帝国石炭”、“关东制钢”、“昭和电工川崎工场”等工会为主，工人们也展开了反对解雇、反对降低劳动条件的罢工斗争。当吉田政府在五月间重新登台的时候，日本最大的造纸企业王子造纸公司和本州造纸公司的工人，为要求增加工资发动罢工，王子造纸公司工人坚持罢工达三个星期之久；仅五月二十日至六月三日两个星期中，就使资方遭受了一亿五千四百万日元的损失，使日本全国各报每周减少了十二页的篇幅，终于迫使垄断资本家接受工人的部分要求。在驻日美军管理下的东京日本制钢所赤羽工厂六千名工人，因为不能忍受美军当局和日本军需财阀的野蛮的剥削和奴役，他们不顾禁令和美军派去的六百名监督生产的武装暴徒的威胁，自六月十六日起开始罢工，要求增加工资四千日元。罢工工人虽然立即受到美军当局的血腥镇压，但是他们仍英勇坚持，直到胜利。被吉田政府剥夺了罢工权利的日本公教人员在生活状况日趋恶劣、物价日益昂贵的情形下，也展开了向吉田政府要求发给夏季津贴的运动，他们举行了数万人的游行示威。这些争取生活权利的斗争，几乎遍及日本全国一切产业部门。许多工会，例如日本通运公司、钢铁工人工会等，过去几乎没有参加过罢工，现在都参加了各该业的统一罢工。日本工人阶级的罢工运动给了美日反动派的备战政策以严重的打击。同时，越来越多的日本劳动人民在争取生活权利的斗争中，更加认识到这样一个真理：只有争取日本的独立、和平与民主，才能根本改善自己的生活条件。
    随着日本工人阶级政治觉悟的提高，他们向美日反动派展开了日益尖锐的政治斗争，并成为日本人民政治生活中的领导力量。他们以实际行动回答了右派社会党分裂分子关于“少牵涉政治”的荒谬论调。今年年初，日本工人阶级向吉田第四次卖国内阁展开了攻势。二月二十八日，日本青年拒绝充当炮灰，在东京举行了全日青年反对征兵的群众大会，打击了吉田恢复军国主义征兵制度的阴谋，日本青年工人是这个运动的骨干。三月十四日三万多工人在东京举行大示威，反对吉田政府制订禁止罢工法案等法西斯法令。工人队伍在日比谷公园举行集会时，大批美国宪兵和日警在会场四周警戒，但工人们举着“美国兵滚回去”和“打倒吉田政府”的标语牌冲过警戒线，在东京闹市中举行了示威，沿途散发传单，要求和平，反对重整军备和反对亲美卖国的吉田政府。就在这一天，吉田内阁倒台了。以工人阶级为首的各阶层人民的频繁的示威和抗议，给日本政治局势带来巨大影响，并成为吉田第四次内阁垮台的重要因素。接着，在四月大选中，日本工人阶级和日本人民一道，在极端不民主的选举条件下，使反动党派在议会中的势力进一步削弱，打击了美帝国主义企图在日本建立一个稳定的保守政权的阴谋。五月二十一日吉田第五次内阁登场后，于六月十四日向国会再度提出“禁止罢工法案”，日本工人阶级便立即用罢工等实际行动予以强有力的反击。六月二十日，日本全国各地举行了反对禁止罢工法、要求发给夏季津贴和要求增加工资的群众大会。有一百五十万人参加了这次全国规模的斗争。七月四日，日本三百万工人在各地举行了定时罢工和抗议大会。吉田政府竟不顾日本工人阶级的强烈抗议，强迫日本众院于七月十一日通过了“禁止罢工法”。就在当天，日本工会总评议会号召三百万会员举行全国规模的第二次总罢工。在此以前，吉田政府法务相犬养健和劳动相小坂善太郎曾先后发表威胁性的谈话，警告工人不得举行罢工来反对“禁止罢工法”；但是二十七万煤矿工人举行了二十四小时罢工，全日本电气产业工人对大工厂实行了停电，金属矿山、造船、化学工业、钢铁、汽车等重要产业部门的工人，纷纷举行了抗议罢工。七月二十七日，“总评”又按期举行了包括罢工在内的第三次抗议斗争，三百万工人参加了这一斗争，表现了日本工人阶级争取民主权利的意志是不可动摇的。
    在日本工人运动的鼓舞和影响下，日本全国正在展开以石川县内滩村为中心的取消美国军事基地的斗争。内滩村的斗争是以工人、农民和渔民为骨干包括其它各阶层以及资产阶级政党的某些人士的广泛的群众性的斗争。继北陆铁道工人拒绝军事运输之后，石川县电业工会和国营铁道工会也相继决议拒绝军事供电和军事运输，支援内滩村的斗争。日本人民反对国土军事基地化的斗争将继续给予美国好战分子及其走狗吉田卖国政府以更沉重的打击。
    日本工人运动在自己的发展过程中，正在克服重重障碍，逐步走向统一的道路。越来越多的日本工人从斗争中认识了右翼社会党分裂分子的欺骗和反动本质，而坚决维护工人阶级的团结和统一行动。
    日本工人阶级严密地警惕着右翼分裂分子企图把日本工会拖入“国际自由工联”和标榜“国际中立”以破坏日本工人阶级和苏联、中国及全世界工人阶级的伟大团结的阴谋。“总评”从第三届大会到第四届大会始终坚持了拒绝参加帝国主义的工具“国际自由工联”的决议。曾经参加“国际自由工联”的各工会组织也纷纷决议退出这个国际资产阶级的御用组织。拥有四十万会员的日本国营铁道工会，在六月间举行的全国大会上通过决议，正式退出“国际自由工联”；拥有十一万会员的私营铁道工会也在第三次全国大会上作出了同样的决议。日本全国电气通讯从业员工会在五月二十一日举行的第六次全国大会上否决了右翼分子关于参加“国际自由工联”的提案。日本许多工会组织已经或正在冲破右翼上层分子的阻挠，切断和“国际自由工联”的关系。电气产业、东京电气公司以及日本制铁业八幡制铁所等工会，其领导机构过去长期为右翼分子所控制，但由于下层群众的激烈反对，也先后修改了它的经济主义与工联主义的工作纲领。所有这些，对于日本工人运动的发展有着重大的意义。
    美日反动派为进一步分裂“总评”，于今年二月唆使他们的代理人组成“全国民主主义劳工运动联络协议会”（简称民劳联），这个组织与“国际自由工联”内外呼应，力图反对日本工人进行争取生存和民主权利的政治斗争，分裂工人阶级的统一行动。但是美日反动派的分裂阴谋并不能阻挠日本工人运动的高涨。今春以来，地区性和产业性的统一罢工已成为普遍现象。这说明了日本工人阶级统一行动的日益加强。在今年七月八日至十一日举行的“总评”第四次全国大会上，进步势力再度击败了右翼分子的分裂活动，使大会胜利地通过了打倒吉田内阁、支持和平运动、反对日本接受“共同安全署”的美援、举行“和平月”及支持内滩村等取消军事基地的斗争、反对禁止罢工法等一系列进步的决议。显然，美日反动派是不甘心放弃它对工人运动分裂和镇压的阴谋的，最近他们仍在对属于“总评”的某些工会组织进行活动，企图削弱和分裂“总评”。但是统治阶级的任何暴行和卑劣的欺诈手段，只能使日本工人阶级更加提高警惕，加强工人阶级内部及其与全体人民的伟大团结。
    目前，日本工人运动正在走向新的高涨。拥有二十七万会员的日本煤矿工会现正酝酿着为反击煤业垄断资本家大批解雇工人的所谓“生产合理化”而举行大罢工。日产汽车公司工人自六月以来为要求发给夏季津贴而进行的斗争，仍在继续发展中。驻日美军雇用的十五万日本工人从八月十二日起举行了四十八小时的总罢工，积极配合了全日本人民反军事基地的斗争。这些行动表现了日本工人阶级的强大力量。正如日本“赤旗报”在七月十五日的社论中提到关于日本工人阶级斗争的现势时指出：日本工人运动正在进入“新的飞跃发展的阶段”。
