(Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 26th) According to TASS, Rome: The 24-hour general strike of Italian workers ended on the 25th. Eight million people participated in the strike, including workers in metallurgy, metal processing, machine manufacturing, textiles, chemicals, and other industries. Tram, bus, and transportation workers also went on strike for four hours.

    During the strike, rallies were held in various Italian cities. Representatives of the three central trade unions—the Italian General Confederation of Labor, the Italian Confederation of Labor of the Working People, and the Italian Labor Union—spoke at the meetings. The Italian General Confederation of Labor put forward the following demands, some of which were supported by the other two central trade unions: increase wages, end the shutdowns in the metallurgical, machine manufacturing, textile, and mining industries, and re-enter into collective contracts for various workers.

    A communiqué issued by the press office of the Italian General Confederation of Labor wrote: The general strike was carried out in an extremely high mood. The striking feature of the strike was the profound unity and coordination of the laborers. In many cities, not a single person went to work in factories of all sizes. When the urban transportation workers went on strike, not a single car could be seen on the streets of many cities. No city published newspapers. Cinemas and other places of entertainment were closed. Almost 100% of workers and staff participated in the strike. The communiqué went on to say that the Secretariat of the Italian General Confederation of Labor expressed its satisfaction and thanked the industrial workers belonging to the trade union organizations and the industrial workers in various residential areas for their united participation in the strike, which was carried out with the highest degree of democratic discipline and without any unexpected incidents. Some news published in "Unità" stated that the scale of the people's participation in the strike in many cities was unprecedented. In Florence, Milan, and Naples, thousands of workers who had never participated in trade union struggles before also did not go to work.

    意大利八百万工人举行总罢工
    罢工的显著特点是劳动者的团结一致
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社罗马讯：意大利工人的二十四小时总罢工已于二十五日结束。参加罢工的有八百万人，包括冶金、金属加工、机器制造、纺织、化学和其他各业工人。电车、汽车和交通工人也罢工四小时。
    在罢工期间，意大利各城市都举行了集会。在会上发表演说的有三个中央工会——意大利总工会、意大利劳动人民工会联合会、意大利劳工联盟的代表。意大利总工会提出了以下的要求，其中一部分并得到其他两个中央工会的支持：增加工资，终止冶金、机器制造、纺织和采矿工业中的停工，重新缔结各种工人的集体合同。
    意大利总工会新闻处发表的公报写道：总罢工是在极其高涨的情绪中进行的，罢工的显著特点是劳动者的深刻的团结一致和协调。在许多城市中，各大小工厂都没有一个人去上工。在城市交通工作人员罢工的时候，许多城市的街道上看不见一辆汽车。没有一个城市出版报纸。电影院和其他娱乐场所都关了门。几乎百分之百的工人和职员参加了罢工。公报接着写道，意大利总工会书记处表示满意并感谢各工会组织所属的工业工人和各居民区的工业工人团结一致地参加罢工，这次罢工是在具有最高度的民主纪律，没有任何意外事件发生的情况下进行的。“团结报”刊载的一些消息说明在许多城市中劳动人民参加罢工的规模是前所未有的。在佛罗伦萨、米兰和那不勒斯，有数千以前从未参加工会斗争的工人也没去上工。
