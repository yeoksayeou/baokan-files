    Northeast Administrative Committee Instructs All Localities
    to Do a Good Job in Autumn Harvesting to Ensure Increased Grain Production
    On September 10th, the Northeast Administrative Committee issued instructions on doing a good job in the autumn harvest, implementing increased production and practicing economy, and ensuring increased grain production.
    The instructions first pointed out the characteristics of this year's autumn harvest work in the Northeast and the significance of increasing production and conserving grain. Most areas of the Northeast, except for some disaster areas, are expected to have a bumper harvest. The southern regions will soon begin harvesting, and the northern regions can begin harvesting within half a month. Due to the many cloudy and rainy days and the lack of sunshine this summer and autumn, the maturation of most crops has been delayed, and the harvesting time has been shortened. Many farmlands are wet and barren, and some crops have even been lodged. In addition, the number of plants per unit has generally increased this year, and the stalks are tall, making the harvest particularly labor-intensive. Moreover, some crops have uneven growth due to untimely tending or the impact of disasters. All these factors make this year's autumn harvest work not only exceptionally tense and heavy, but also extremely prone to grain losses and reduced quality. This is the basic characteristic of this year's autumn harvest. Therefore, carrying out an autumn harvest production increase and conservation movement, improving the quality of autumn harvest operations, preventing losses and waste, and ensuring that every grain returns home are the basic requirements of this year's autumn harvest work. All localities must concentrate their efforts, thoroughly mobilize and organize the broad masses of farmers, and harvest in a timely manner according to the maturity of the crops, harvesting carefully and threshing meticulously. For some crops that are not evenly mature, one should harvest one piece after another to prevent late harvesting from spoiling the crops. For some crops that are still green, effective measures should be discussed with the masses to promote early ripening of the grains and avoid frost damage. In autumn harvest work, it is necessary to pay attention to mobilizing the masses to study the advanced experiences in the entire process of harvesting, pulling, and threshing various crops, and effectively improve the methods of combining harvesting and pulling, and improve the technology of pulling to the field and threshing, so as to harvest more grain and improve the quality of the grain. Cotton-growing areas should pick as they open to avoid waiting for all the bolls to open before picking, so as not to affect the yield and quality of cotton, and should also pay attention to strengthening pruning and drainage to promote early boll opening and strive to harvest more pre-frost cotton.
    Before the autumn harvest, all localities should conduct a planned inspection and rectification of mutual aid and cooperation organizations, go deep into the groups and societies, and specifically solve the problems existing within the groups and societies (especially clarifying labor accounts and other mutual benefit issues), summarize and promote the experiences of flexible allocation of labor and reasonable work calculation during spring plowing and summer hoeing, thereby improving labor efficiency, consolidating and improving mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and ensuring the autumn harvest. According to the specific conditions of the groups and societies, formulate feasible and simple autumn harvest plans to ensure timely autumn harvest; some larger mutual aid groups can carry out group operations under unified leadership on the basis of voluntary participation of the masses; help and organize mutual aid among mutual aid groups and individual farmers who have already broken up, in order to overcome the difficulties in the autumn harvest. For the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, the work of harvesting on their behalf should be done more conscientiously. In addition, all localities should make preparations for the autumn harvest distribution of agricultural production cooperatives and the establishment of new cooperatives next year under leadership.
    Disaster areas should pay attention to overcoming the negative emotions of pessimism and despair among some of the masses and the dependent mentality of simply waiting for relief, and actively organize the masses to carry out autumn harvesting and production and disaster relief work. Regardless of the severity of the disaster area, it should be ensured that all the grains that can be harvested are harvested and brought home, preventing any possible abandonment of harvesting.
    In order to concentrate all efforts on doing a good job in the autumn harvest, all general elections and other unnecessary meetings and training activities should be stopped in rural areas during the autumn harvest period, and rural work cadres should devote all their efforts to leading and organizing the autumn harvest work of the masses.
    Agricultural experiment stations, demonstration and propagation farms, agricultural technology guidance stations, etc. in all localities should, under the unified leadership of the provincial agricultural department or the county agricultural section, organize agricultural technicians in a planned manner to conduct key investigations and research on several major crops in the local area, and in combination with local farming conditions, deeply summarize the experience of technical production increase, especially the experience of reasonable close planting and disaster prevention and production protection. For some cases where production has been reduced due to blind implementation of wide sowing and dense planting or due to other technical errors due to separation from other farming conditions, the reasons should be carefully identified and lessons should be learned. All localities must also closely combine the autumn harvest to organize the masses to actively do a good job in seed selection and autumn land preparation. When turning the land, the quantity should be required on the basis of ensuring quality to prevent rough practices.
    The instructions finally stated: The autumn harvest is approaching, and cadres in all localities must further deepen their leadership, and appropriately arrange the above-mentioned production work starting from the specific conditions of different regions. It is necessary to understand the ideological situation of the masses, implement the comprehensive production policy, and focus on explaining clearly to the farmers the fair, reasonable and encouraging burden policy of "how much land is planted, how much grain should be produced, assessed according to the rate, reduced or exempted according to law, and increased production without increasing taxes," and the principles of reduction and exemption such as "small disaster, small reduction, heavy disaster, large reduction, and special heavy total exemption," in order to improve the production enthusiasm of the masses; and to carry out patriotic production increase and conservation ideological education universally and deeply, so that the masses truly understand that every grain is directly related to the national economic construction and the improvement of the lives of the farmers themselves, so as to ensure the successful completion of this year's autumn harvest work.

    东北行政委员会指示各地
    做好秋收工作保证粮食增产
    东北行政委员会在九月十日发出关于做好秋收贯彻增产节约保证粮食增产的指示。
    指示首先指出了东北今年秋收工作中的特点和增产节约粮食的意义。东北目前除部分灾区外，大部地区丰收在望。南部地区即将动镰收割，北部地区半月内也可开始秋收。由于今年夏、秋阴雨多，日照少，大部庄稼成熟延迟，收割时间缩短；许多农田土湿地荒，部分庄稼并有倒伏现象，加之今年庄稼一般的单位株数增多，秸棵高大，收获格外费工；以及部分庄稼因侍弄不及时，或受灾害的影响，生育不齐等情况，使得今年秋收工作不但异常紧张繁重，而且极易使粮食遭受损失和降低质量。这就是今年秋收的基本特点。因此，开展秋收增产节约运动，提高秋收作业质量，防止损失浪费，作到颗粒还家，是今年秋收工作的基本要求。各地必须集中力量，深入动员和组织广大农民，根据庄稼成熟情况，及时进行收割，细收细打。对部分成熟不齐的庄稼，应实行熟一片割一片，防止割晚糟蹋。对某些贪青的庄稼，应和群众商量采取有效办法，促进籽粒早熟，避免霜害。在秋收工作中，必须注意发动群众研究各种庄稼收割拉打全部过程中的先进经验，切实改进割、拉结合的方法，提高拉地打场的技术，以便收进更多的粮食并提高粮食质量。棉区要做到随开随捡，防止某些等待花絮开齐再捡的做法，以免影响棉花的产量和质量，并要注意加强整枝与排水工作，以促进棉花提早开絮，争取多收霜前花。
    各地应在秋收前有计划地对互助合作组织进行一次检查与整顿，深入组、社，具体解决组、社内部存在的问题（特别是找清工账等互利问题），总结与推广春耕、夏锄期间灵活调配劳动力、合理计工，从而提高劳动效率的经验，巩固与提高互助合作组织，保证秋收。根据组、社具体条件，制订切实可行的简单的秋收计划，保证及时秋收；某些规模较大的互助组，在群众自愿的基础上，可在统一领导下，实行分组作业；帮助与组织已经散伙的互助组和单干农户，换工互助，以克服秋收中的困难。对于烈属、军属，更要认真作好代收工作。此外，各地应有领导地做好农业生产合作社的秋收分配与明年新建社的准备工作。
    灾区应注意克服某些群众悲观失望的消极情绪和单纯等待救济的依赖思想，积极组织群众进行秋收和生产救灾工作。不论轻重灾区，都应保证把可能收获的粮食全部收获到家，防止可能发生的某些弃收现象。
    为了集中全力做好秋收工作，秋收期间，农村里应一律停止普选工作及其他一切不必要的会议和训练等活动，农村工作干部应全力领导和组织群众的秋收工作。
    各地农业试验场、示范繁殖场、农业技术指导站等应在省农业厅或县农业科的统一领导下，有计划地组织农业技术人员，就当地几种主要作物，重点进行调查研究，结合当地耕作条件，深入总结技术增产经验，特别是合理密植和防灾保产的经验。对于某些因脱离其他耕作条件，盲目实行宽播密植或由于其他技术上的错误而造成减产的，亦应认真找出原因，总结教训。各地并须紧密结合秋收，组织群众积极做好选种和秋翻地的工作。翻地时，应在保证质量的基础上要求数量，防止粗糙的作法。
    指示最后说：秋收即将到来，各地干部必须进一步深入领导，从不同地区的具体情况出发，恰当地安排上述各项生产工作。要摸清群众的思想情况，贯彻全面生产政策，着重向农民交代清楚“种多少地，应产多少粮食，依率计征，依法减免，增产不增税”的公平合理、鼓励增产的负担政策，和“轻灾少减，重灾多减，特重全免”等减免原则，提高群众生产情绪；并普遍深入进行爱国增产节约的思想教育，使群众真正懂得每一粒粮食都直接关系到国家经济建设事业和农民自己生活的改善，以保证今年秋收工作的胜利完成。
