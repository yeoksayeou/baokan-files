The Design Bureau of the Central First Ministry of Machine Building convened a design conference from August 31 to September 10, gathering its affiliated design units to summarize the work of the past six months. Based on overcoming blindness, the conference arranged design tasks for 1954 and specifically studied the main methods for completing tasks while ensuring design quality.

The summary pointed out that thanks to the implementation of the correct policies stipulated by higher authorities and the direct guidance of Soviet experts over the past six months, design work has been preliminarily launched and some achievements have been made through the efforts of all personnel. This is reflected in the following: In accordance with the policy of unified and centralized design forces and the organizational principle of combining regions and specialties, a Design Bureau specifically leading design work and several branch bureaus with basically professional orientations actually conducting design were established successively. Organizational adjustments were also made within the branch bureaus, thus design strength has increased by 2.7 times compared to before unified centralization. In the past six months, each newly established branch bureau has completed several preliminary designs, technical designs, and construction drawings, accumulated some experience in factory design, and established design plans and review systems, initially correcting the erroneous views that design cannot be planned and that quality is not important. In the earlier established branch bureaus, through the inspection of specific design projects, criticism of erroneous design ideas was carried out, design quality was improved, and technical levels were raised, so the atmosphere of learning from Soviet advanced experience was also relatively strong, and other units also began to pay attention to learning from Soviet design materials and advanced design examples.

The summary also pointed out that learning advanced design ideas is not enough. There has been a great deal of blindness in design work in the past six months. Therefore, the design progress plan determined in March of this year has basically not been completed on schedule. Although there are some objective conditions that affect the delay of design progress, the main reasons are poor design quality, low work efficiency, and many errors and rework. This is reflected in insufficient preparation work before design, poor coordination in design, and some units do not seriously collect original design data or do not study the collected data (especially engineering geological data) before starting design; the design principles are not fully studied and analyzed before being busy with calculations. Therefore, for some heavy factory civil engineering designs that have been completed, the exact load of soil bearing capacity has not yet been calculated; some factory general layout drawings have been designed with several options, but the existing buildings have not been checked clearly: what is on the drawings does not exist in reality; what exists in reality does not exist on the drawings. As for the detailed appraisal work on the use of original equipment, old buildings, and old pipelines, and the possibility of utilization, it is similarly not given much importance. The quota indicators adopted in the design pay attention to advancement, but do not fit the specific conditions. Therefore, the indicators of process design often do not pay attention to analyzing the conditions of batch and complexity of production and are copied rigidly. For example, indicators for mass production are used without analysis in small batch production; workshops for small batch production use equipment for mass production, and so on. The conference pointed out that the basic reason for these shortcomings is that learning advanced design ideas is not enough, and the design principles guided by Soviet experts are not studied or implemented enough. Existing facts have proven that those who resolutely learn advanced design ideas or seriously study the design principles guided by Soviet experts and carry out design, the quality must be good and the rework must be less.

After several days of discussion, the thinking was unified. Then, based on overcoming blindness, the design tasks for 1954 were arranged more properly. And under the principle of ensuring that the design projects for construction in 1954 can be submitted on time, and that the preparatory work before the design of the design projects for construction in 1955 is done well, the planned progress was arranged.

In order to ensure that the progress plan set by the conference can be guaranteed, the conference pointed out that the following key tasks must be grasped in the future:

First, continue to strengthen design planning work. The planning work must be arranged to the section, group and individual plans on a factory basis. Individual sections and groups can try to arrange plans according to the design method of indicated charts when conditions are mature, further clarify the design procedures, establish a contact system, and establish and implement a responsibility system in weak links to ensure the completion of the plan.

Second, earnestly establish and consolidate the design review system to check the design guiding ideology and clarify the design principles of each factory, so that errors can be discovered in time and major rework can be avoided to ensure design quality.

Third, closely coordinate civil engineering design and process design. At present, the civil engineering design force of the branch bureau is not strong. In the case that the civil engineering design personnel do not understand the process part, and the process design personnel do not understand the civil engineering part, in order to cultivate the force and complete the task, the civil engineering design personnel must collect the original data until the construction requirements are put forward; in addition, during the construction process, the civil engineering design personnel must cooperate with the process design personnel and jointly form an inspection team to the construction site to inspect the construction project, in order to achieve the purpose of linking theory with practice, accumulating experience, protecting design, and correcting errors.

Fourth, strengthen data exchange and management work, and gradually change the phenomenon that data work lags behind design. In order to manage the data well, use it well, and vigorously organize the compilation of data, strive to complete it within three months to half a year, so as to keep up with the technical design reference.

Fifth, unite, educate, and improve all cadres. At present, in the case of a shortage of design personnel, in the future, we must conduct inspections and summaries through specific design projects frequently and in a timely manner in the design process, criticize erroneous design ideas, so as to ensure design quality and improve design level. Attention should be paid to vigorously cultivating and promoting young student cadres, so that they can quickly establish and master correct design ideas.

The conference emphasized that whether each design unit can improve design ideas and complete design tasks, the main key lies in the leadership. Therefore, leading cadres must strengthen theoretical study, closely contact the masses, combine inspection and summary work, continue to launch the struggle against bureaucracy, and overcome bureaucracy that does not pay attention to objective reality and does not study business.

    中央第一机械部召开设计会议
    总结经验和布置明年度设计任务
    中央第一机械工业部设计总局于八月三十一日至九月十日召集所属设计单位举行设计会议，总结了半年工作，并在克服盲目性的基础上安排了一九五四年度设计任务，具体研究了在保证设计质量的原则下完成任务的主要方法。
    总结中指出：半年来由于执行上级规定的正确方针，并接受了苏联专家的直接指导，在全体人员的努力下，设计工作已初步展开，并取得了一些成绩。这表现在：依据统一集中设计力量的方针和按地区与专业相结合的组织原则，先后成立了专门领导设计工作的设计总局与实际进行设计的基本上有专业方向的若干分局，并在分局内部进行了组织调整，因而设计力量比统一集中以前壮大了二点七倍。各新成立的分局在半年中完成了若干个初步设计和技术设计、施工图，积累了一些工厂设计的经验，并建立了设计计划和审查制度，初步纠正了设计不能订计划和不重视质量的错误观点。在成立较早的分局，通过具体设计项目的检查，展开了对错误设计思想的批判，改进了设计质量，提高了技术水平，因而学习苏联先进经验的空气也比较浓厚，其他单位也开始注意学习苏联设计资料与先进设计范例。
    总结中又指出了，学习先进的设计思想还是不够的，半年来设计工作中还存在着很大的盲目性，因而今年三月份确定的设计进度计划，基本上没有按期完成。虽然影响设计进度的推迟，还存在着若干客观条件，但主要原因是设计质量不好，工作效率不高，错误多，返工多。这表现在设计前的准备工作不足，设计中联系不好，有些单位没有认真地收集设计原始资料或者收集了资料不加研究（特别是工程地质资料），就开始设计；设计的原则没有充分研究、分析，就忙于计算，因此有的重厂房土建设计已经做好了，地耐力的确实负荷还没有算清，有的厂总平面布置图已设计了几个方案，对已建筑的房屋还没有查清，图上有的，实地没有；实地有的，图上没有，至于原有设备旧建筑物和旧管路的使用情况，利用的可能性的详细鉴定工作，同样地不很重视。在设计中采用的定额指标，注意了先进性，但不切合具体条件，因而工艺设计的指标，往往不注意分析生产的成批性和复杂性的条件而照抄硬套，例如把大量生产用的指标不加分析地搬到小批生产中来用；小批生产的车间，采用大量生产的设备等等。会议指出产生这些缺点的基本原因是由于学习先进的设计思想不够，对于苏联专家指导的设计原则研究不够，贯彻不够。已有事实证明，凡是坚决学习了先进的设计思想或认真研究了苏联专家指导的设计原则进行设计的，一定质量好、返工少。
    经过了几天的讨论，统一了思想。接着在克服盲目性的基础上，较妥善地安排了一九五四年度设计任务。并在保证一九五四年施工的设计项目能按时交图，对一九五五年施工的设计项目做好设计前准备工作的原则下，排定了计划进度。
    为了使会议所定的进度计划能得到保证，会议指出今后必须抓紧以下几项主要工作：
    第一、继续加强设计计划工作，必须以厂为单位把计划工作排到科组和个人计划中去。个别科组条件成熟，可以试行按指示图表的设计方法排计划，进一步明确设计程序，建立联系制度，并在薄弱环节上建立和贯彻责任制，以保证计划的完成。
    第二、认真建立和巩固设计审查制度，以检查每个厂的设计指导思想和明确设计原则，使能及时发现错误，避免重大返工，以保证设计质量。
    第三、密切土建设计和工艺设计的配合。目前分局土建设计力量不强，在土建设计人员不懂工艺部分，工艺设计人员不懂土建部分的情况下，为了培养力量、完成任务，土建设计人员必须自收集原始资料起直到提出施工上的要求为止；此外在施工进行过程中，土建设计人员必须和工艺设计人员配合，并共同组成检查小组到工地检查施工工程。以达到联系实际、积累经验、保护设计、修正错误的目的。
    第四、加强资料交流及管理工作，逐步改变资料工作落后于设计的现象。为了使资料能管理得好，使用得好，并大力组织资料汇编工作，争取在三个月到半年内完成，以便跟得上技术设计参考之用。
    第五、团结教育提高全体干部。在目前设计人员缺乏的情况下，今后必须在设计过程中经常地、及时地通过具体设计项目进行检查、总结，批判错误的设计思想，以保证设计质量，提高设计水平。要注意对青年学生干部大力培养和提拔，使能迅速地树立和掌握正确的设计思想。
    会议强调各设计单位能否提高设计思想，完成设计任务，主要关键在于领导，因此领导干部必须加强理论学习，密切联系群众，结合检查和总结工作，继续展开反官僚主义斗争，克服不重视客观实际，不钻研业务的官僚主义。
