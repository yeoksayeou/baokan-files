Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 31st: The "Indian Times" published an editorial on August 29th stating that the United States suffered a "moral defeat" in the United Nations in obstructing India's participation in the political conference. The editorial pointed out that, apart from Greece, Pakistan, and the Kuomintang, only Latin American countries stood with the United States in voting against India's participation in the conference. This shows that the United States "has broken away from its European allies and Asian countries and has fallen into complete isolation."

The editorial said that the US attitude "has damaged the cause of peace". The United States "has incurred the guilt of obstructing a peaceful solution."

Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, August 31st: According to TASS, some Swedish bourgeois newspapers criticized the US attitude at the Seventh Session of the UN General Assembly, especially the US attitude toward India's participation in the Korean political conference.

"Stockholm News" emphasized in an editorial that the United States achieved a "dubious victory" by obstructing India's participation in the conference. "Stockholm News" said that world opinion is correct in saying that this was a "victory at a great price." Obstructing India's participation in the conference "cannot but give the impression that the United States rudely excludes one of the real powers in the region from a conference that is in fact related to all issues in this region."

The newspaper said that Americans often say that their attitude is to cater to Syngman Rhee. "If this is the case, it is ridiculous that the foreign policy of a world power like the United States depends on a small dictator in East Asia on such an important issue. It is better to say that the United States itself is against a round table conference."

Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 31st: According to TASS, commenting on the situation and final results of the UN General Assembly's discussion on India's participation in the political conference, the "Washington Post" wrote that the US chief representative to the United Nations, Lodge, brought the atmosphere of the US Congress into diplomatic occasions. It seems that he is treating the United Nations as a Republican convention and the Indian delegation as a second-class delegation. This attitude not only creates an unpleasant feeling, but also makes it practically impossible to sincerely discuss many issues in the United Nations.

"New York World Telegram and Sun" wrote: The result of the UN General Assembly's vote on India's participation in the political conference was a "psychological defeat for the United States." The newspaper pointed out that only a few insignificant countries supported the United States in opposing India's participation.

    印度等国报纸抨击美国在联合国的专横态度
    【新华社三十一日讯】新德里消息：“印度时报”八月二十九日发表社论说，美国在联合国中在阻挠印度参加政治会议问题上遭到了“道义上的失败”。社论指出，除了希腊、巴基斯坦和国民党外，和美国站在一边投票反对印度参加会议的只有拉丁美洲国家。这说明美国“已脱离了它的欧洲盟国以及亚洲国家，而陷于完全孤立的状态”。
    社论说，美国的态度“已经使和平事业受到了损害”。美国“已自己招致了阻挠和平解决的罪名。”
    【新华社三十一日讯】据塔斯社斯德哥尔摩三十日讯：瑞典一些资产阶级报纸抨击美国在联合国第七届大会上的态度，特别是抨击美国对于印度参加朝鲜政治会议的态度。
    “斯德哥尔摩新闻”在一篇社论中强调指出：美国阻挠印度参加会议，得到了“可以怀疑的胜利”。“斯德哥尔摩新闻”说，世界舆论说得对，这是一次“付出极大代价的胜利”。阻挠印度参加会议，“使人不能不得到这样的印象：美国无礼地把世界这个地区的真正大国之一，排除在事实上和这个地区所有问题有关的会议之外。”
    该报说，美国人常常说，他们的态度是为了迎合李承晚。“如果真是这样，像美国这样一个世界强国在这么重要的问题上的外交政策竟取决于东亚一个小独裁者，那是十分可笑的。倒不如说是美国自己反对圆桌会议。”
    【新华社三十一日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：“华盛顿邮报”在评论联合国大会讨论关于印度参加政治会议问题的情形及最后结果时写道，美国驻联合国首席代表洛奇把美国国会中的气氛带到外交场合上去了。看样子，他是在把联合国当成共和党的代表大会，而把印度代表团看成了二等的代表团。这种态度结果不仅造成一种不愉快的感觉，并且使在联合国中真诚地讨论许多问题实际上都成为不可能。
    “纽约世界电讯与太阳报”写道：联合国大会关于印度参加政治会议问题的表决的结果，是“美国在心理上的失败”。该报指出，支持美国反对印度参加的仅仅是一些无足轻重的国家。
