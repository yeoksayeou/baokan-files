    Beijing is Gradually Repairing and Building New School Buildings for Middle and Primary Schools

    With the development of the national economic construction, the Beijing Municipal People's Government is gradually repairing, expanding, and building new school buildings for middle and primary schools.

    The number of students in Beijing's middle and primary schools has increased significantly in the past four years, from over 180,000 in 1949 to over 310,000 now. To adapt to this situation, the Beijing Municipal People's Government has increased the funds allocated for school building construction every year. According to statistics, a total of over 112,000 square meters of new school buildings were constructed from 1950 to 1952; in 1953, the planned construction area for school buildings for middle and primary schools and kindergartens is over 130,000 square meters. This greatly exceeds the total school building area built in Beijing in the past 40 years; it is equivalent to 54.4 percent of the total area of all middle and primary school buildings in Beijing before liberation.

    When addressing the issue of school buildings for middle and primary schools, the Beijing Municipal People's Government first focused on the repair and expansion of existing school buildings. From 1950 to 1953, the Municipal People's Government allocated a total of over 30 billion yuan to maintain and repair most of the school buildings in the city; for many schools that felt their school buildings were insufficient during development, expansions were carried out on the original basis. A total of 36 middle schools and 282 primary schools were expanded throughout the city. For example, the original No. 4 Middle School had 5,000 square meters of school buildings, which could only accommodate more than 700 students. To meet the school's development needs, the Municipal People's Government allocated funds to build over 3,380 square meters of classrooms, libraries, and dining halls. For existing school buildings that were indeed old and dilapidated and could not be used, such as Xinjiekou Primary School, the Municipal People's Government allocated funds to build new school buildings elsewhere.

    Since liberation, Beijing has built 15 new secondary schools and 10 primary schools. In the past, most of Beijing's middle schools were concentrated in prosperous urban areas, and there were very few middle schools in the areas where working people lived. For example, in Chongwen District, there was only one private middle school with four classes and about 200 students before liberation. After liberation, the Municipal People's Government gradually established the No. 11 Middle School, the No. 50 Middle School, and the No. 7 Girls' Middle School in the district, with 52 classes and more than 2,000 students. As another example, the suburbs had only three municipal middle schools before liberation; now, eight middle schools and one affiliated middle school class have been added. These middle schools in the suburbs have all built relatively complete new school buildings. However, when the country begins to carry out economic construction in a planned way, it is not possible to solve all school building construction problems in the short term. The Beijing Municipal People's Government will adapt to the people's growing cultural needs and solve the problem of school buildings gradually and in a planned way.

### 北京市逐步修缮和新建中、小学校校舍

    北京市逐步修缮和新建中、小学校校舍
    随着国家经济建设事业的发展，北京市人民政府正在逐步修缮、扩充和新建中、小学校的校舍。
    北京市中、小学学生人数四年来增加很多，一九四九年是十八万多人，现在已增加到三十一万多人。为了适应这种情况，北京市人民政府拨出的修建校舍的经费，每年都有增加。据统计，从一九五○年到一九五二年的三年中，新建的校舍工程共十一万二千多平方公尺；一九五三年计划建筑中、小学和幼儿园等的校舍面积共十三万多平方公尺。这大大地超过了四十多年来北京在学校建筑面积上的总和；相当于解放前北京市所有中、小学校校舍总面积的百分之五十四点四。
    北京市人民政府在解决中、小学校校舍问题时，首先注意到原有校舍的修缮和扩建。从一九五○年到一九五三年的四年中，市人民政府共拨出经费三百多亿元，对全市大部分中、小学校校舍进行了维护修缮工作；对于很多在发展过程中感到校舍不够的学校，便在原有的基础上进行了扩建。全市扩建的学校有中学三十六所、小学二百八十二所。如市第四中学原有五千平方公尺的校舍，只能容纳七百多学生，市人民政府为适应该校发展的需要，拨款建筑了三千三百八十多平方公尺的教室、图书馆和饭厅。对原有校舍确已古老腐朽不能使用者，如新街口小学，市人民政府便拨款另行建筑新校舍。
    解放以来，北京市已经新建了十五所中等学校和十所小学校。过去北京的中学大都集中在繁华市区，在劳动人民居住的地方很少有中等学校。如崇文区，解放前只有一所私立中学，共四个班，学生二百人左右。解放后，市人民政府在该区逐步建立了市第十一中学、第五十中学和第七女子中学，有五十二个班级、两千多名学生。又如全部郊区解放前只有三所市立中学，现在已增加了八所中学和一个附设中学班。这些郊区的中学都已建筑了相当完善的新校舍。但是在国家开始有计划地进行经济建设的时候，还不可能在短期内解决全部校舍的建筑问题。北京市人民政府将适应人民日益增长的文化需要，逐年地有计划地来解决学校校舍。
