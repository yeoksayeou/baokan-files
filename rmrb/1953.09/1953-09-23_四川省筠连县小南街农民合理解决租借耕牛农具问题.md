    Peasants in Xiaonan Street, Junlian County, Sichuan Province, Reasonably Solve the Problem of Renting Cattle and Farm Tools

    Letter from Yuan Huaijun of the CPC Junlian County Committee, Sichuan: There is a shortage of cattle in Xiaonan Street (suburb) of the First District of Junlian County, and some poor peasants lack farm tools. In the past, when renting cattle and farm tools in this street, there were phenomena that infringed upon the interests of peasants. For example, poor peasant Chen Daoyun of the Sixth Group rented cattle from middle peasant Cao Shaozhou the year before last, and has not yet paid the cattle rent; Zhao Shufa of the Fourth Group rents cattle from Gu Mingxing, and does not let the cattle rest at noon after putting the harrow on them in the morning; Gu Shuxian borrowed the plow and manure bucket from Hu Guocheng, and never returned them after using them, and did not care even if the manure bucket was broken. Therefore, this year, peasants with cattle and farm tools are unwilling to let others rent them, which has increased the difficulty for poor peasants who lack cattle power and farm tools in autumn plowing and autumn planting.

    After the cadres leading production in the area understood this situation, they vigorously carried out education on unity and mutual assistance in early August, and held meetings to mobilize peasants to negotiate and settle the cattle rent (those who had difficulty paying at the time would definitely pay after the autumn harvest), repair and return the borrowed farm tools. Everyone also studied and decided: In the future, the cattle rent will be calculated on an annual basis, with one *dou* of rice for plowing four *tiao* and eight *tian huang*, to be paid after the autumn harvest; a rent will also be paid for borrowing large farm tools.

    After the meeting, some peasants quickly paid off the arrears of cattle rent; Gu Shuxian, who broke Hu Guocheng's manure bucket, also tried to compensate. The concerns of households with cattle and households with more farm tools were eliminated, and they were willing to lend cattle and farm tools to help others solve their difficulties. At the same time, in order to avoid rushing to use cattle and farm tools during the autumn harvest and autumn plowing, everyone also discussed a method of scheduling work. In this way, the difficulty of lacking cattle and farm tools for some peasants in Xiaonan Street was successfully resolved.

### 四川省筠连县小南街农民合理解决租借耕牛农具问题

    四川省筠连县小南街农民合理解决租借耕牛农具问题
    中共四川筠连县委会袁怀均来信：筠连县一区小南街（郊区）耕牛不够，还有些贫苦农民缺乏农具。过去该街在租借耕牛、农具时，曾有侵犯农民利益的现象，如六组贫农陈道云前年租中农曹少州的牛，现在还没有付牛租；四组赵书发租古明兴的牛，早晨套上耙子，晌午还不放牛休息；古树先借胡国成的犁头、粪桶，用了就不还，粪桶用烂了也不管。因此，今年有耕牛、农具的农民不愿让人租借，这就增加了贫苦农民秋耕秋种中缺乏牛力、农具的困难。
    当地领导生产的干部了解这种情况后，在八月初就大力进行了团结互助的教育，并开会动员农民协商结清牛租（当时付有困难的，到秋收后一定付清），修好并送还借来的农具。大家还研究决定：今后牛租按全年计算，犁四挑八田黄谷一斗，在秋收后付清；借用大农具也酌付租金。
    会后，有的农民很快付清了拖欠的牛租；古树先弄坏了胡国成的粪桶，也设法赔偿。有牛户和农具较多的户的顾虑消除了，都愿意出借耕牛、农具，帮助别人解决困难。同时，为了避免秋收、秋耕中抢用耕牛、农具，大家又商量了排工办法。这样，小南街部分农民缺乏耕牛、农具的困难就顺利地解决了。
