The Northeast Coal Mine Administration Bureau of the Central Fuel Industry Ministry and the Northeast Committee of the China Coal Miners' Union jointly convened the Northeast Coal Mine Tunneling Representatives Meeting in Fuxin from September 7th to 11th. This meeting aimed to reverse the long-standing situation where tunneling lagged behind coal mining, and to ensure the comprehensive, balanced, and over-fulfilled completion of production tasks. The meeting clarified the special importance of tunneling, exposed the tendency of leading cadres to neglect tunneling work, and earnestly exchanged advanced experiences that are crucial for rapid tunneling. Tunneling worker representatives from the Northeast coal mine system proposed a tunneling competition to ensure the over-fulfillment of the annual tunneling plan and create conditions for next year's production.

The primary process in coal mine industrial production is tunnel excavation; without it, coal mining is impossible. However, the Northeast Coal Mine Administration Bureau only completed 85.3 percent of its tunneling plan from January to July. Ten out of its twelve subordinate mining bureaus failed to meet their tunneling plans. Some mine entrances, due to failure to complete the tunneling plan and prepare reserve mining areas on time, were forced to cease production because the coal in the old mining areas had been exhausted. In July, enterprises under the Northeast Coal Mine Administration Bureau reduced coal production by 70,000 tons due to this reason.

The main reasons for failing to complete the tunnel excavation plan are: First, leading cadres have insufficient understanding of tunneling as the primary link in coal mine production and the need to maintain a balanced development between excavation and mining. They relaxed their leadership over tunneling work and even artificially hindered the completion of the tunneling plan. Second, planning management is lagging behind. This is mainly manifested in neglecting production drilling, incomplete geological data, inaccurate overall and partial designs of tunnels, and failure to construct according to plan. As a result, "blind tunnels" were dug when encountering changes in natural conditions, which wasted tunneling resources and led to an insufficient number of coal mining faces. Third, the experience of rapid tunneling by Cui Guoshan and Ma Liuhai has not been promoted deeply and thoroughly. Although various bureaus organized 273 rapid tunneling teams in the first half of the year, only eleven teams reached the rapid standard due to relaxed leadership. Fourth, tunneling quotas and wages are unreasonable. The income of general tunneling workers is lower than that of coal mining workers, causing tunneling workers to be unwilling to do tunneling work.

After repeated discussions at the meeting, everyone clarified the significant role of tunnel excavation in coal mine production. Leading cadres at all levels focused on reviewing their ideological tendencies of not attaching importance to tunneling work. At the same time, administrative management cadres, Party and mass work cadres, technical work cadres, and tunneling team leaders, group leaders, and worker representatives exchanged advanced experiences in leading tunneling work and improving tunneling efficiency through separate discussions. Two advanced mines, seven advanced tunnel entrances, and nineteen advanced rapid tunneling teams were selected as models for future learning.

In the summary report, Cai Silie, Deputy Director of the Northeast Coal Mine Administration Bureau, emphasized that in order to reverse the situation of failing to complete the tunneling plan, political work must first be strengthened to criticize the one-sided view of leaders at all levels who do not attach importance to tunneling work. Secondly, preparatory work must be strengthened, geological conditions must be clarified, and accurate designs must be made. Thirdly, leadership over rapid tunneling teams and tunneling groups must be strengthened, and sufficient technicians, physically strong workers, and excellent machinery, equipment, and tools must be equipped and must not be transferred at will. Fourthly, the experiences of Cui Guoshan and Ma Liuhai, the experience of cyclical operation according to instruction charts, deep drilling, hollow blasting, three-ring central rods, and finished and protective canopies, and other nine advanced experiences and tools must be vigorously promoted to improve tunneling efficiency and carry out production under the premise of ensuring safety.

At the closing meeting, the representative of the Cui Guoshan rapid tunneling team from the Jixi Mining Bureau, the banner of Northeast tunneling work, first responded to the call of the Northeast Committee of the China Coal Miners' Union and issued a friendly challenge to the Northeast rapid tunneling teams and tunneling groups. The Cui Guoshan rapid tunneling team, having already over-fulfilled the tunneling plan from January to August, proposed to complete the annual tunneling plan two months ahead of schedule, excavate an additional 1,000 meters of roadways, prepare more reserve mining areas, and ensure the over-fulfillment of the coal mining plan. Immediately afterwards, the Ji Xiangguo rapid tunneling team from the Beipiao Mining Bureau proposed a challenge condition: to guarantee completion of the annual tunneling plan half a month ahead of schedule and to ensure that 96 percent of the roadways meet specifications. Li Baoshu rapid tunneling team from Fuxin, Chen Xi rapid tunneling team from Xi'an, and others also responded to the challenge.

### 东北召开煤矿掘进代表会议  保证超额完成全年掘进计划

    东北召开煤矿掘进代表会议
    保证超额完成全年掘进计划
    中央燃料工业部东北煤矿管理局与中国煤矿工会东北委员会，为扭转煤矿掘进长期落后于采煤的局面，保证全面均衡地超额完成生产任务，于九月七日到十一日，在阜新联合召开了东北煤矿掘进代表会议。这次会议明确了掘进的特殊重要性，揭发了领导干部中忽视掘进工作的思想倾向；认真交流了对快速掘进有决定意义的先进经验。东北煤矿系统的掘进工人代表，在会上提出了保证超额完成全年掘进计划并为明年生产创造条件的掘进同工种竞赛。
    煤矿工业生产的首要工序，是坑道掘进，没有它，就不可能采煤。但东北煤矿管理局一月份到七月份的坑道掘进计划，却只完成百分之八十五点三，所属十二个矿务局，就有十个局没有完成掘进计划。有的坑口，因为没完成掘进计划，没按时准备好预备采区，而旧采区的煤已经采光，被迫不得不停止生产。七月份东北煤矿管理局所属企业就曾因此少产七万吨煤。
    完不成坑道掘进计划的主要原因：一是领导干部对掘进是煤矿生产的首要环节、必须保持采掘平衡发展的认识不足，放松了对掘进工作的领导，甚而人为地阻碍掘进计划的完成。二是计划管理落后。主要表现在忽视生产探钻，地质资料不全、坑道总体设计与局部设计不准确，不按计划施工。结果遇到自然条件的变化而送了“瞎道”，既浪费了掘进力量又造成采煤工作面不足。三是崔国山、马六孩的快速掘进经验推广得不深不透。上半年各局虽然组织了二百七十三队次快速掘进队，因为放松了领导，只有十一队次达到了快速标准。四是掘进定额和工资不合理。一般掘进工人的收入都低于采煤工人的收入，致使掘进工人不安心做掘进工作。
      会议经过反复讨论，大家明确了坑道掘进在煤矿生产上的重大意义之后，各级领导干部着重地检讨了不重视掘进工作的思想倾向。同时，参加会议的行政管理干部、党群工作干部、技术工作干部和掘进队长、组长、工人代表们，分头通过座谈方式，认真地交流了有关领导掘进工作和提高掘进效率的先进经验。并评选出两个先进矿，七个先进坑口，十九个先进的快速掘进队，作为今后学习的榜样。
    在总结报告里，东北煤矿管理局蔡斯烈副局长强调指出：为了扭转完不成掘进计划的局面，首先必须加强政治工作，批判各级领导不重视掘进工作的片面观点；其次，必须加强准备工作，弄清地质情况作出确切的设计；第三，必须加强对快速掘进队和掘进组的领导，配备足够的技术高、身体强健的工人和优良的机器设备及工具，不得随便调动；第四，必须大力推广崔国山、马六孩的经验、按指示图表循环作业经验、深打眼、空心爆破、三环中心杆和成品棚子、护顶棚子等九种先进经验和工具，以提高掘进效率，在保证安全的条件下进行生产。
    在闭幕会上，东北掘进工作的旗帜鸡西矿务局崔国山快速掘进队的代表，首先响应中国煤矿工会东北委员会的号召，向东北各快速掘进队和掘进组提出友谊的挑战。崔国山快速掘进队，在已经超额完成一月份至八月份掘进计划的基础上，提出提前两个月完成全年掘进计划，并多掘进一千公尺巷道，准备更多的预备采区，保证采煤计划超额完成。紧接着，北票矿务局季祥国快速掘进队提出应战条件：保证提前半个月完成全年掘进计划，保证百分之九十六的巷道合乎规格。阜新的李宝书快速掘进队、西安的陈锡快速掘进队等，都纷纷应战。
