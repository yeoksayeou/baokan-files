Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 5th: In response to the Soviet government's call for heavy industry factories to participate in the production of daily necessities, many heavy industry enterprises in various parts of the Soviet Union are striving to increase their production of these goods. For example, metallurgical and machine-building enterprises in Novosibirsk will produce daily necessities worth 51 million rubles this year. One metallurgical factory has expanded its enamelware manufacturing workshop and will produce utensils worth more than 10 million rubles by the end of the year. Other heavy industry enterprises in the city have also begun to manufacture high-quality furniture, iron-framed beds, toys, clothing, amplifiers, etc. In the Southern Urals, many machine-building and metallurgical enterprises are also expanding the production of daily necessities. The Chelyabinsk Steel Pipe Factory is using waste products from its main production to manufacture nickel-plated wire beds. The output of these beds has increased by 42 percent compared to last year. The Chelyabinsk Tractor Factory will produce 95 tons of aluminum utensils this year, 20 tons more than last year. The Kolyushchenko Factory and the Lenin Factory in Zlatoust, as well as the Magnitogorsk Steel Plant, are all expanding the use of waste products to manufacture daily necessities, improving the quality and variety of products. In addition to their main production, heavy industry factories in the Western Urals are also manufacturing various daily necessities. The Lysva Metallurgical Plant, the largest in the Molotov Oblast, manufactures 35 types of enameled utensils, such as milk pails, iron cans, basins, plates, dishes, pots, etc. There are 22 different styles of frying pans alone. Production of well-selling enameled teapots and wine glasses has been expanded. In the past, the surface of the utensils was coated with granite or variegated enamel, but now metallurgical workers have mastered the technique of coating the surface of the utensils with cyan, blue, and green enamel. Recently, the factory tested a completely new enamel, the formula for which was developed by workers in cooperation with scientists from Leningrad. Advanced ingredient mixers, enamelers, and utensil bakers regularly over fulfill their work quotas. The stainless-steel teaspoons and soup spoons manufactured by the Natvin Metallurgical Plant are well-known. The factory has increased its output of soup spoons this year, and has already produced 500,000 spoons of various types in the past six months. Advanced grinders have already produced soup spoons according to the October or November plan.

    苏联各地重工业工厂努力增加日用品生产
    【新华社五日讯】莫斯科消息：在苏联政府吸收重工业工厂参加日用品生产的号召下，苏联许多地方的重工业企业纷纷努力增加其日用品生产量。例如，新西伯利亚城的冶金工业和机器制造业的企业，今年生产日用品的价值将达五千一百万卢布。有一家冶金工厂扩大了制造珐琅质器皿的车间，到年底将生产价值一千万卢布以上的器皿。该城其他重工业企业也开始制造质量很好的家具、铁架子床、玩具、服饰品、扩音器等。在南乌拉尔，许多机器制造企业和冶金企业也在扩大日用品的生产。车里雅宾斯克钢管工厂利用主要生产剩下的废品制造镀镍钢丝床。这种床的产量已比去年增加百分之四十二。车里雅宾斯克拖拉机工厂今年将生产九十五吨的铝制器皿，比去年多二十吨。车里雅宾斯克的科柳钦工厂、齐拉图斯特的列宁工厂，以及马格尼托哥尔斯克炼钢工厂都在扩大利用废品来制造日用品，改善产品的质量和种类。西乌拉尔重工业工厂除主要生产外，也正制造各种日用品。莫洛托夫州最大的勒西文斯克冶金工厂制造三十五种珐琅器皿，如奶桶、铁罐、盆、盘、碟、壶等。仅炒菜锅出的式样就有二十二种。销路很好的珐琅质茶壶和酒杯的生产扩大了。过去器皿的表面一直用花岗岩或杂色瓷釉，而现在冶金工人已掌握了用青色、蓝色和绿色瓷釉来涂器皿表面的技术。最近该厂试验了一种完全新的瓷釉，这种瓷釉配料是工人跟列宁格勒科学工作者合作制成的。先进的配料工、上釉工、器皿焙烧工经常超额完成工作任务。纳特文冶金工厂用不锈钢制造的茶勺和汤勺是很出名的。该厂今年出产的汤勺增加了，过去半年已经生产了五十万把各种匙。先进磨工都已按照十月或十一月的计划生产汤勺。
