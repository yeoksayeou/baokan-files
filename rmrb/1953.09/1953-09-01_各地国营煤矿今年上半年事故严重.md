    State-Owned Coal Mines Across the Country Experience Serious Accidents in the First Half of This Year
    [Reported by this newspaper] State-owned coal mines across the country experienced serious accidents in the first half of this year, which greatly affected the completion of production tasks.
    In order to improve safety work in coal mines, the Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry and the National Committee of the National Coal Miners' Union of China successively convened a Coal Mine Safety Production Conference and a National Coal Mine Grassroots Cadre Safety Production Conference. They proposed guidelines such as carrying out safety production campaigns, calling for the elimination of deaths and the elimination of malignant accidents such as gas explosions and water inrushes this year. However, according to the current situation, only a few mining bureaus have conscientiously implemented the resolutions of these two conferences, and most mining bureaus have not implemented them well. Therefore, accidents in the first half of this year have not only not decreased but have become more serious than in the same period in 1952. In particular, casualties in state-owned coal mines in the Northeast and East China regions have increased significantly.
    Units such as Yangquan Mining Bureau, Fengfeng Mining Bureau, Huainan Mining Bureau, Hunan Xiangjiang Coal Mine, and Zixing Coal Mine have conscientiously implemented the resolutions of the conferences and effectively improved safety work. As a result, safety and production situations have improved. These units launched major safety inspection campaigns in the first half of this year, during which leading cadres conducted in-depth self-criticism and criticized one-sided views and bureaucratic work styles that only sought output regardless of safety. They held regular safety regulation tests among cadres and engineering technicians. In the process of studying safety regulations, they promoted the advanced experiences of Shi Yuhai and Liu Jiuxue in safe production, and organized group leaders for blasting, shoring, and transportation, as well as safety officers, to participate in rotating training classes to study safety regulations. In order to ensure the thorough implementation of safety regulations, mines such as Huainan and Yangquan implemented a zoning and dedicated responsibility system, established and improved various systems, strengthened the safety technical leadership organizations, and held mass safety inspections every month to promptly resolve problems in safety work. Because these units actively strengthened safety work, they basically reversed the serious situation of continuously rising accidents. For example, Hunan Xiangjiang Coal Mine, because it attached importance to safety production work, eliminated deaths and serious injuries in the first half of this year. As a result, the production enthusiasm of employees was high, and the production situation improved accordingly. Huainan Datong Mine learned from past accidents and identified the safety regulations that were most easily violated. It mobilized workers to study these regulations and implement them in their work. As a result, accidents decreased, and output increased.
    Many coal mines have not implemented the spirit of the conferences well and effectively strengthened safety work. Jingxing Mining Bureau only carried out general communication of the resolutions and did not formulate specific implementation plans. The No. 1 Mine of the bureau experienced five roof collapse accidents in the first quarter, reducing coal production by 1,834 tons. However, leading cadres did not seriously investigate the causes and actively prevent recurrence. Therefore, on June 7, a serious accident occurred again in the No. 2 Mine of the bureau, drowning ten workers and poisoning two workers with gas, one of whom died after emergency treatment failed. Leading cadres of Hubei Yuanhua Coal Mine have consistently not paid enough attention to the policy of safe production and have neglected safety education. Workers universally violate regulations by smoking underground, and there have been two near fires. However, leading cadres did not promptly stop it. As a result, on May 29, a serious fire accident was finally caused by workers smoking, resulting in 15 deaths and 6 injuries.
    Some coal mine cadres even hold erroneous and resistant attitudes toward safety work. For example, leading cadres of the Jingxi Mining Bureau did not pay attention to the implementation of safety regulations or the opinions of safety inspectors, and they transferred safety inspectors to do production work, thereby weakening the leadership of safety work. The North China Coal Mine Administration sent people to inspect, but the leading cadres of the mine refused to include safety work in the current work. In this year's safety production campaign, mines such as Xi'an, Hegang, Jixi, Jiaohe, and Tonghua have also not made effective plans to improve future safety work, especially relaxing safety education for grassroots cadres, resulting in continuous accidents. Because the safety situation in these coal mines is not good, the production tasks are generally poorly completed.

### 各地国营煤矿今年上半年事故严重

    各地国营煤矿今年上半年事故严重
    【本报讯】各地国营煤矿今年上半年事故很严重，使生产任务的完成受到极大影响。
    中央燃料工业部煤矿管理总局和中国煤矿工会全国委员会为了改善煤矿安全工作，曾先后召开了煤矿安全生产会议和全国煤矿基层干部安全生产会议，提出了开展安全生产运动等方针，号召在今年一定要消灭死亡现象，和消灭瓦斯爆炸、透水等恶性事故。但根据目前情况看来，只有少数矿务局认真贯彻了这两次会议的决议，大部分矿务局都没有很好贯彻，因此，今年上半年事故不但没有减轻，反而较一九五二年同期更为严重，特别是东北地区和华东地区国营煤矿的伤亡事故大大增加了。
    阳泉矿务局、峰峰矿务局、淮南矿务局、湖南湘江煤矿、资兴煤矿等单位认真地执行了会议的决议，切实改进了安全工作，因而安全情况和生产情况都有好转。这些单位在今年上半年都先后展开了保安大检查运动，领导干部深刻检查和批判了只求产量不管安全的片面观点和官僚主义作风，在干部和工程技术人员中举行了定期的保安规程的测验。在学习保安规程中，推广了施玉海、刘九学安全生产的先进经验，并分别组织了放炮、支柱、运输小组长和保安员参加轮训班学习保安规程。淮南、阳泉等矿为了保证保安规程的彻底执行，实行了分区专责包干制的办法，建立和健全了各项制度，健全了保安技术领导机构，并每月举行一次群众性的保安大检查，以便及时解决保安工作中的问题。这些单位因为积极加强了安全工作，基本上扭转了事故不断上升的严重局面。如湖南湘江煤矿因为重视了安全生产工作，今年上半年消灭了死亡和重伤事故，因而职工生产情绪高涨，生产情况随之好转。淮南大通矿接受过去发生事故的教训，确定了最易违反的几条保安规程，发动工人学习这些规程，并贯彻到工作中去，结果事故减少，产量增加。
    有许多煤矿没有很好贯彻会议的精神，切实加强安全工作。井陉矿务局只进行了一般的传达，没有作出具体的执行计划。该局第一矿第一季度先后发生五次冒顶事故，减产一千八百三十四吨煤。但领导干部并未认真查明原因，积极防止再次发生事故，因此，六月七日该局二矿再度发生严重事故，淹死工人十人，两个工人被瓦斯薰倒，其中一个急救无效死亡。湖北源华煤矿领导干部由于一贯对安全生产的方针不够重视，忽视安全教育，工人普遍违反规程在井下吸烟，并有两次几乎失火，但领导干部没有及时制止，结果在五月二十九日终于因工人吸烟而酿成严重失火事故，死亡十五人，负伤六人。
    有些煤矿的干部对安全工作甚至抱着错误的对抗态度，如京西矿务局领导干部竟不重视保安规程的执行、不重视安全检查人员意见，把安全检查人员抽去做生产工作，以致削弱了对安全工作的领导，华北煤矿管理局曾派人去检查，而该矿领导干部竟表示拒绝把安全工作列入到当前的工作中去。西安、鹤岗、鸡西、蛟河、通化等矿在今年的安全生产运动中，也都没有切实作出改进今后安全工作的有效计划，特别是放松了对基层干部的保安教育，以致不断酿成事故。以上这些煤矿由于安全情况不好，生产任务一般的都完成得很差。
