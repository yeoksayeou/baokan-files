The literary works for children are a powerful tool in the cause of cultivating and educating the new generation. Guiding young pioneers' after-school reading of literary books should be a very important method for the Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers organizations to educate young people. The charter of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League clearly stipulates that "the League organizations should attach importance to the publication of reading materials for young people." Over the past four years, the experience of many school Young Pioneers organizations in leading reading work has proved that children's literary works have played a huge and profound role in cultivating children into a new generation with five loves, who are healthy, lively, brave, and honest.

However, this work has not yet attracted the attention of the Youth League committees and their children's work departments in all regions. Most League organizations do not know much about the reading of books by young people, and their leadership is insufficient. This work has not attracted enough attention from schools and Young Pioneers organizations, and there are still many problems in the work. We have not tried to arouse children's interest in reading literary books, we have not guided children's reading, and we have not tried to make the large number of good books that have been published available to children. This is equivalent to abandoning a powerful weapon for ideological and moral education for children, and therefore we cannot fight against the influence of bad books. These bad books take advantage of our lack of vigilance, relying on their own publishing and distribution organizations (sometimes through state-owned bookstores), private bookstores and book stalls, adopting the method of low rents and simple procedures to infiltrate into the hands of young people in large quantities, seriously poisoning the pure minds of the new generation. This is a major shortcoming in children's education.

At present, the main problem in children's reading of literary works is that there are too few good literary works for children. This problem has attracted the attention of the leading organs in creation and publishing, and it will be gradually improved in the future. The League organizations should first strengthen their leadership over youth and children's newspapers and periodicals, youth and children's publishing houses, vigorously organize manuscripts related to young people, improve the quality of children's books in terms of printing, binding, illustrations, etc., increase the number of publications, and appropriately reduce prices. Secondly, they should strengthen their ties with other children's publishing institutions and writers to jointly improve the backward situation in the creation and publication of children's reading materials. However, publishing a large number of good books may still be a long process. Therefore, the more realistic problem for the current leadership of children's after-school reading work should be how to make full use of a batch of good and better reading materials that have been created and published. Solving this problem will move the work of children's after-school reading a step forward.

How to make full use of the good books that have been created and published?

First, the League and team organizations in schools should attach importance to guiding young people to choose and read literary books, and regard reading as an important daily task. Now, some teachers and counselors have been able to inspire children's interest in reading; improve children's reading methods, deepen their understanding of the meaning of books, and make them a force to guide their life practice. Some teachers and counselors can also pay attention to improving children's literary accomplishment and language level from guiding children's reading; and gradually consolidate their interest in reading and develop good habits of regular reading. For example, Fu Cai, the former sixth-grade homeroom teacher and counselor of Dongtiejiang Hutong Primary School in Beijing, consciously introduced books to children for a long time, so that all the children in the class could see them. He also used methods such as organizing literary groups and inviting writers to guide them in writing poems to make children often like to read. And like to write stories and compose lyrics. For example, many Young Pioneers have held gatherings about "Zoya". This is based on everyone reading "The Story of Zoya and Shura". The counselor helps several team members choose the most meaningful paragraphs in the book to speak or recite; some also help the team members make a slide of a section of the book to show or perform; and some combine the class situation to discuss several issues, such as how Zoya studied. This kind of gathering leaves an extremely deep impression on the children about the heroic characters and exemplary deeds in the book, and Zoya thus becomes a role model for the children to learn from. Facts have proved that teachers and counselors who can guide after-school reading to cooperate with teaching work will gradually feel that: a new atmosphere is gradually emerging in their class (or squadron); children have made significant progress in moral behavior and learning discipline, their desire for knowledge is greatly enhanced, their knowledge horizon is broadened, and their composition has greatly improved.

However, most school administrators, teachers, and counselors have not given due attention to the work of guiding children's after-school reading. Because young people are young and lack the ability to choose books, some young people read good books and bad books at the same time. A child who loves "Paul Kochakin" the most also loves to read martial arts novels very much, and regards knights as the bravest people like Paul. They also do not understand reading methods. When they see good books, they often read them roughly because they have not received correct guidance, and they forget them after reading them, or they are not easy to understand the meaning of the books. They only read stories, not descriptions; or they only look at pictures and illustrations. Very few can read carefully and organize discussions. Although some schools have already started this work, due to lack of experience, children's reading is mostly left to run wild.

In guiding after-school reading work, it is also necessary for the educational administration departments and the League organizations to educate school administrators, teachers, and counselors, and repeatedly explain the important significance of guiding after-school reading work. It is a part of school education, not an extra burden on teachers. It is one of the important ways of activities of the Young Pioneers. In addition, the educational administration departments and the League organizations are also required to regularly understand and check the guidance of after-school reading work in various schools and Young Pioneers organizations, and promptly summarize and exchange good experiences. For example, the Kunming Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League investigated and understood the influence and harm of bad picture books on children, summarized the experiences of three schools where counselors led extracurricular reading well, and made a mobilization and experience introduction at the city's general counselor meeting on June 20 this year, and launched a discussion. Afterwards, in order to be able to lead children's extracurricular reading, many school teachers also began to read "baby books" that they used to think they had no interest in, and felt that good children's literary books had great help in their teaching and cultivating children's conscious observance of discipline. In Xianhe Primary School in the city, the number of teachers who love to read children's books has increased from one to thirty among the 36 teachers in the school. Because the guidance role of teachers in children's reading has been strengthened, there are almost no children in the school who read bad picture books, and the Young Pioneers' room is full of children reading new books.

This working method of the Kunming Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League is worthy of our attention.

Second, according to the current situation in our country, very few young people have the ability to buy books themselves, and even fewer can buy many books. Therefore, with good books, libraries and schools need to supply them, and teachers and counselors need to do a lot of organizational work so that more young people can read more good books.

According to the materials sent by the Youth League committees in various places, libraries or young people's reading rooms have been established in some cities. In addition to providing young people with reading, they also promote books to schools. For example, the children's branch of the Beijing Library has established book circulation stations in 32 schools, and has also established a team collective borrowing system with 108 Young Pioneers teams. This greatly accelerated the turnover rate of books, increased many readers, and provided good conditions for children's after-school reading in schools. However, there are still too few young people's libraries in the country, which are far from meeting the needs of children. In addition to Shanghai having three children's libraries, 61 children's reading rooms, and 11 children's book supply stations, with a total of more than 144,000 books, Beijing only has one children's library and one better young people's reading room, with a total of less than 25,000 books. It is estimated that other cities will have even fewer. There are also some books in the library that are not suitable for young people to read. Because the work of introducing and guiding children to choose books and read has not been done well enough, readers cannot often see good books.

Schools are the places where young people are concentrated. Whether schools can supply books is often the main condition for whether after-school reading can be carried out. Some schools attach importance to this work and squeeze out a sum of money every semester to buy books even when the school's funds are difficult. Some teachers and counselors organize students to borrow books from their own or their older siblings to establish class (squadron) libraries to supplement the source of books. Some rural primary schools, although they cannot squeeze out book funds, teachers try to use saving kerosene costs, selling manure and other methods to buy books. Xiliangdian Village Primary School in Gaoyang County, Hebei Province, although located in a remote rural area, has only more than 90 students; but the counselor once mobilized students to engage in a slight labor, and used the income to buy books; the Young Pioneers and some workers from the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant (villagers) established contact, and the workers gave them some books. The team members often make their own books (books made by clipping and pasting pictures and photos from newspapers and periodicals). They also adopted some other methods to make the school have more than 200 books. For example, the library of Shanghai Gezhi Middle School created the method of "recommended books collective borrowing", focusing on buying good books, with a small number of more than ten copies and as many as fifty copies; speeding up the turnover rate of books so that more students can read good books.

However, because the number of schools in our country has developed very quickly and the education funding is not very generous; and because the vast majority of schools and Young Pioneers organizations do not pay enough attention to extracurricular reading work, there are still very few schools that actively try to purchase or organize books as mentioned above. Judging from the national scope: most primary schools (mainly rural primary schools) have no books at all; some primary schools have a small number of books, but children have long been tired of reading them; a few schools have more and new books (middle school books are more than primary school books, but there are very few books suitable for junior high school first and second grade students). In schools with books, there are still many problems: 1. Because teachers and counselors do not understand the good or bad of children's books and the depth of the content, there are not many good books suitable for children's age characteristics in the books purchased by the school. Even in the libraries of many schools, feudal, yellow, and even reactionary books have not been cleared out. 2. Most schools (especially primary schools) still use funds equally when buying books, only seeking many types, and not paying attention to good books should have many copies. 3. Some schools are afraid that books will be easily damaged after being borrowed, so they emphasize so-called "led" reading, that is, reading under the supervision of teachers, and students are not allowed to borrow books home. Teachers are very busy, and students do not even have much time to borrow and read at school. Individual schools simply lock up the bookcase for a long time and treat the books as decorations for the school.

In order to better cultivate and educate young people, in order to fight against all harmful books, the cultural and educational departments need to appropriately add public and school libraries (or reading rooms) and increase the number of good books. Teachers and counselors should overcome all difficulties, try to organize the source of books, and increase the reading turnover rate of existing books. The League organizations should always care about and pay attention to the supply of children's books, and reflect and make suggestions to the relevant parties.

Third, we must strengthen the evaluation and introduction of children's reading materials, introduce good books, and criticize bad books. In the past, some children's reading materials have been introduced and criticized in newspapers and magazines, and book lists have been recommended, which have played a very good role. The number of readers of the books that have been introduced and recommended has increased all of a sudden. But this work has been done too little, and the recognized good books that have been introduced can be counted on the fingers. We can say with certainty that there are still a number of good books in the published children's literary reading materials, including creation, translation, comic albums, and scientific knowledge reading materials. If these books can be introduced in a more systematic way, it will provide a standard for teachers, counselors, and book buyers who guide after-school reading, and it will expand the scope of children's reading of good books. However, up to now, it is not very clear to everyone how many good books there are in the thousands of children's books that have been published. This situation makes the publication and distribution of children's reading materials very blind, and also makes the purchase, borrowing, and reading of books by libraries, schools, parents, and children blind. Bad books also have sales, but good books often have no chance to reach the hands of readers.

The evaluation and introduction of children's reading materials (especially the introduction work) is a relatively arduous task, which requires the joint efforts of writers, publishing circles, newspapers, bookstores, libraries, and school teachers, counselors, and all children's education work. The League organizations have the responsibility to regularly assist all relevant parties to better complete this task.

    青年团的组织要认真指导儿童阅读文艺书籍
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会少年儿童部副部长  刘祖荣
    在培养教育新一代的事业中，儿童文艺读物是一种有力的工具。领导少年儿童课余阅读文艺书籍，应该是青年团和少年先锋队的组织教育少年儿童很重要的方法。在中国新民主主义青年团的团章里，并且明确地规定了“团的组织要重视少年儿童读物的出版”。四年来，不少学校少年先锋队组织领导读书工作的经验，证明了儿童文艺读物在培养儿童成为具有五爱品德、健壮、活泼、勇敢、诚实的新的一代的工作上，是起了巨大的深刻的作用的。
    但是，这个工作，还没有引起所有地区的团委及其少年儿童工作部门的重视。多数团的组织对少年儿童的阅读书籍的情况是了解不多，领导不够的。这个工作，也没有引起广大学校和少年先锋队组织的足够重视，工作中还存在很多问题。我们没有设法引起儿童阅读文艺书籍的兴趣，没有去指导儿童阅读，也没有设法使已出版的大量好书供应到儿童手里，这就等于放弃了对儿童进行思想品德教育的有力武器，因此也就无法与坏书的影响进行斗争。而这些坏书籍却利用我们疏于警惕，凭借着自己的出版和发行机构（有时通过国营书店），通过私营的书店和书摊，采取租价低廉，手续简便的办法，大量地渗透到少年儿童的手里，严重地毒害着新一代的纯洁的心灵。这是儿童教育工作中的一个重大缺憾。
    目前儿童阅读文艺读物方面的主要问题，是好的儿童文艺读物太少，这个问题已经引起创作和出版工作方面领导机关的注意，今后会逐步改进。青年团的组织应首先加强对青年和少年儿童报刊、青年和少年儿童出版社的领导，大力组织有关少年儿童的稿件，提高儿童书籍的印刷、装订、插图等方面的质量，增加出版数量，适当减低定价。其次，应加强对其他少年儿童出版机构和作家的联系，以共同改善儿童读物的创作和出版方面的落后情况。但是出版大量好书，恐怕仍有一个较长时期的过程。因此，对于当前领导儿童课余阅读工作更有现实意义的问题，应该是如何充分地运用已经创作和出版的一批好的和较好的读物。解决了这个问题，就能把儿童课余阅读的工作，向前推进一步。
    如何充分运用已经创作和出版的好书呢？
    第一，学校里团和队的组织，应当重视指导少年儿童选择并阅读文艺书籍的工作，把读书工作作为一件日常的重要工作。现在，有一些教师和辅导员们，已经能够启发儿童们的阅读兴趣；改进儿童们的读书方法，加深他们领会书中的意义，使之成为指导他们生活实践的力量。有一些教师和辅导员们还能从指导儿童阅读工作中，注意提高儿童们的文学修养和语文水平；并逐渐地巩固他们的读书兴趣，养成经常阅读的良好习惯。如北京东铁匠胡同小学前任六年级班主任兼辅导员傅埰曾在较长时期内有意识地给儿童介绍书籍，使全班儿童都能看到。又用组织文艺小组，请作家来指导他们写诗等方法，使儿童经常地喜爱读书。并喜爱写故事、编歌词。又如有很多少先队都举行过有关“卓娅”的集会，这是在大家读过“卓娅和舒拉的故事”的基础上，辅导员帮助几个队员选择书中最有意义的几段来讲或朗诵；有的还帮助队员把书中的一段制成幻灯片放映或者表演；也有的结合班级情况，讨论几个问题，如卓娅是怎样学习的等等。这种集会，使儿童对书中英雄人物和模范事迹留下了极为深刻的印象，卓娅就这样成为儿童们学习的榜样。事实证明，凡是能以指导课余阅读来配合教学工作的教师和辅导员，就会逐渐感觉到：他们的班级（或中队）里逐渐出现了一种新的气象；儿童们在品德行为上、在学习纪律上有着显著的进步，他们的求知欲大为旺盛，知识眼界扩大了，作文有了很大的进步。
    但是，大部分的学校行政、教师和辅导员们，对于指导儿童课余阅读的工作，还没有予以应有的重视。由于少年儿童年龄小，缺乏选择书籍的能力，有些少年儿童看好书，同时也看坏书。一个最喜爱“保尔·柯察金”的孩子，同样十分爱看武侠小说，把侠客和保尔一样看作是最勇敢的人。他们又不懂读书方法，看到好书，也因没有得到正确的指导，多半粗枝大叶地看过去，看了就忘了，或者不易领会书中的意义。他们只看故事，不看描写；或者只看图画、插画。能够认真阅读，组织讨论的极少极少。有些学校虽然已经开始进行这个工作，但由于缺乏经验，儿童们的阅读，也大多陷于自流。
    在指导课余阅读工作方面，还有必要由教育行政部门和青年团的组织，向学校行政、教师和辅导员进行教育，反复说明指导课余阅读工作的重要意义。它是学校教育的一部分，而不是教师的额外负担。它是少年先锋队的活动的重要方式之一。另外，也要求教育行政部门和青年团的组织，经常了解和检查各学校和少年先锋队组织指导课余阅读工作的情况，并及时总结和交流好的经验。如青年团昆明市委曾调查和了解坏小人书在儿童中的影响毒害，总结了三个辅导员领导课外阅读较好的学校的经验，在今年六月二十日召开全市总辅导员会时，作了动员和经验介绍，并展开了讨论。以后，许多学校教师为了能领导儿童课外阅读，自己也开始看从前认为没有兴趣的“娃娃书”，并感到好的儿童文艺书籍对自己的教学和培养儿童自觉遵守纪律方面，都有很大的帮助。该市咸和小学全校三十六个教师中，爱看儿童读物的已从一人增加到三十人。由于加强了教师对儿童阅读的指导作用，全校看坏小人书的几乎没有了，而在少先队室里则坐满了看新书的孩子。
    青年团昆明市委的这种工作方法是值得我们注意的。
    第二，根据目前我国的情况，少年儿童自己有能力买书的为数不多，能买许多书的人更少。因此，有了好书，还需要由图书馆和学校来供给，需要教师和辅导员们做许多组织工作，以便更多的少年儿童能读到更多的好书。
    据各地团委寄来的材料看，某些城市中已建立了图书馆或少年儿童阅览室。他们除了供给少年儿童阅览外，还把图书推广到学校去。如北京市图书馆儿童分馆在三十二个学校里建立了图书流通站，又与一百零八个少年先锋队小队建立了小队集体借阅制度。这样，就大大加速了图书的周转率，增加了许多读者，为学校儿童的课余阅读，提供了良好的条件。但是，现在全国少年儿童图书馆还太少，远不能满足儿童的要求。除了上海市有三个儿童图书馆、六十一个儿童阅览室、十一个儿童图书供应站，共有图书十四万四千余册外，北京只有一个儿童图书馆、一个较好的少年儿童阅览室，共有图书不到二万五千册。其他城市估计更要少一些。而图书馆中还有一部分图书是不适合少年儿童阅读的。由于图书馆介绍和指导儿童选择图书和阅读的工作还做得不够，读者还不能经常看到好书。
    学校是少年儿童集中的地方，学校能否供给图书，往往是课余阅读工作能否开展的主要条件。有一些学校重视这个工作，在学校经费困难的情况下，每学期都挤出一笔款项购买图书。有些学校的教师和辅导员，组织学生借出自己的或哥哥姐姐的图书，建立班级（中队）图书馆，补充了书的来源。有些农村小学虽然挤不出图书经费，但教师们设法用节省灯油费，出卖粪便等办法来购买图书。河北省高阳县西良淀村小学，虽然处在偏僻的农村，只有九十多个学生；但辅导员曾动员学生从事一次轻微劳动，以所得报酬来买书；少年先锋队员和石景山钢铁厂一些工人（本村人）建立了通讯联系，工人们赠给他们一些书。队员们并经常自制书（由报刊上剪下的图画照片编贴而成的书）。还采用了一些其他办法，使学校有了两百几十本图书。又如上海格致中学图书室创造了“推荐书集体借阅”的办法，重点购买好书，复本少的十多本，多至五十本；加快图书周转率，使更多的同学能读到好书。
    但是，由于我国的学校数量发展得很快，教育经费还不是很宽裕；更由于广大的学校和少年先锋队组织对课外阅读工作重视不够，像上述积极设法购置或组织图书的学校还很少。就全国范围来估计：大部分小学（主要是农村小学）完全没有图书；一部分小学有少量图书，但是儿童早已看腻了；少数学校有较多而新的图书（中学的图书要比小学多一些，但适合于初中一、二年级学生看的书就很少了）。在有图书的学校里，还存在许多问题：一、由于教师和辅导员都不了解儿童读物的好坏和内容的深浅，因此，学校所买的图书，能适合儿童年龄特点的好书就不多。甚至在许多学校的图书馆中，还未把封建、黄色以至反动的书籍清除出去。二、大多数学校（特别是小学）买书时，还平均使用经费，只求种类多，而不注意好书应该多备复本。三、有一部分学校怕图书出借后容易损坏，就强调所谓“有领导”的阅读，即在教师监视下阅读，不准学生把书借回家去。而教师工作很忙，学生连在校借阅的时间也不多。个别的学校，索性长期把书橱锁起来，把图书当作学校的装饰品。
    为了更好地培养教育少年儿童，为了与一切有毒害的书籍作斗争，需要文教部门适当地增设公共的和学校的图书馆（或阅览室），增加好书数量。教师和辅导员则应该克服一切困难，设法组织图书的来源，增加已有图书的阅读周转率。团的组织应经常关心和注意有关儿童图书的供应情况，并向各有关方面反映和提出建议。
    第三，要加强儿童读物的评介工作，介绍好书，批评坏书。过去，在报刊杂志上曾经介绍和批评过一些儿童读物，推荐过书单，起了很好的作用。凡是被介绍推荐的书，读者一下子增多了。但是这个工作做得太少，被介绍过的、公认的好书，少得屈指可数。我们可以肯定地说，在已出版的儿童文艺读物中还有一批好书，包括创作、翻译、连环画册和科学知识读物。如果能把这些书较有系统地介绍出来，就会使指导课余阅读的教师、辅导员和买书的读者，有了一个标准，就会扩大儿童阅读好书的范围。但是，到目前为止，在已出版的几千种儿童读物中，究竟有多少种好书，大家都还不是太清楚。这种情况，使儿童读物的出版和发行工作，带着很大的盲目性，也使图书馆、学校、家长和儿童的购书、借书、读书都带着盲目性。坏书也有了销路，而好书却往往没有机会到达读者的手里。
    儿童读物的评介工作（特别是介绍工作），是一件比较艰巨的工作，需要作家、出版界、报刊、书店、图书馆、以及学校教师、辅导员和所有儿童教育工作等各个方面，共同努力。团的组织有责任经常协助各有关方面来更好地完成这个任务。
