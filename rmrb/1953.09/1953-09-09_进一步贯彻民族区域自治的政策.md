    Further Implement the Policy of National Regional Autonomy

    National regional autonomy is a fundamental policy of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government to resolve China's ethnic issues, applying the Marxist-Leninist theory on ethnic questions by Comrade Mao Zedong. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government have attached great importance to and shown great concern for promoting national regional autonomy. After the Central People's Government promulgated the "Outline for the Implementation of National Regional Autonomy of the People's Republic of China" in August 1952, the work of promoting national regional autonomy throughout the country has made great progress and remarkable achievements. As of March 1953, forty-seven national autonomous regions at or above the county level had been established nationwide, in addition to many national autonomous regions at the district and township levels. The minority population within the autonomous regions has reached over ten million. The work of establishing national autonomous regions is still ongoing throughout the country, and many new national autonomous regions will be established in the future.

    The implementation of the policy of national regional autonomy has enabled minority nationalities with certain areas of concentrated residence to realize their right to "be masters of their own affairs" within their own nationalities under the unified leadership of the Central People's Government. This has achieved positive results universally and significantly, enhanced the political enthusiasm, initiative, and patriotism of all ethnic groups; strengthened unity between and within ethnic groups; closely connected the autonomous organs and the people; and gradually promoted the political, economic, and cultural development of the minority nationalities. Particularly significant is the increase in the patriotism of the minority peoples and the strengthening of national unity. They actively participated in major actions such as suppressing counter-revolutionaries, eradicating bandits, resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and defending the motherland's borders. Their heartfelt love and support for the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government are increasing day by day. They say: "In the past, we had no home, but now Chairman Mao has given us a home." "What we couldn't win even by fighting in the past, Chairman Mao has given us." They praise Chairman Mao as "the sun in winter" and "the rain in summer." The minority peoples in the autonomous regions have strengthened their friendship with and trust in the Han people, recognizing the advanced and leading role of the Han people as the main body of China; the ties between various regions, tribes, and religious factions within each ethnic group have also become closer, and unity has been strengthened day by day. All of these have proven and continue to prove the superiority of the national regional autonomy system, proving and continuing to prove that it is indeed the key to solving China's ethnic issues.

    The experience accumulated nationwide in promoting national regional autonomy over the past three or four years is vivid and rich. The most fundamental aspect, as proposed in the "Basic Summary of the Experience in Promoting National Regional Autonomy" at the Third (Enlarged) Meeting of the Central Nationalities Affairs Commission, is that it is necessary to fully consider the characteristics and specific circumstances of each minority nationality in all work; it is necessary to strengthen and consolidate unity between and within ethnic groups; it is necessary to gradually nationalize the autonomous organs; it is necessary to help the autonomous regions gradually exercise their autonomous rights; and it is necessary to strive to develop the political, economic, and cultural undertakings of the autonomous regions to the greatest extent possible under feasible conditions. Among these valuable experiences, the issues of the nationalization of autonomous organs and helping autonomous regions develop their political, economic, and cultural undertakings are particularly noteworthy at present.

    The nationalization of autonomous organs is the core issue of the national regional autonomy policy. According to the relevant provisions of the "Outline for the Implementation of National Regional Autonomy of the People's Republic of China," the nationalization of autonomous organs includes: the autonomous organs should be composed mainly of personnel from the nationalities exercising regional autonomy; the specific form of the autonomous organs should be based on the wishes of the majority of the people of the nationality exercising regional autonomy and the leading figures connected to the masses; the autonomous organs should adopt a national language commonly used in their autonomous region as the main tool for exercising their functions and powers; the autonomous organs should pay attention to the use of national forms in their work. In simple terms, the nationalization of autonomous organs means that the nationality exercising regional autonomy mainly uses its own cadres, in its own language, and appropriately using its own national forms to manage the internal affairs of its own nationality.

    As early as November 6, 1938, Comrade Mao Zedong proposed at the Enlarged Sixth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party: "First, the Mongol, Hui, Tibetan, Miao, Yao, Yi, and Fan nationalities should be allowed equal rights with the Han nationality, and under the principle of jointly resisting Japan, they should have the right to manage their own affairs, and at the same time, they should unite with the Han nationality to establish a unified country. Second, in areas where various minority nationalities live in mixed communities with the Han nationality, the local government must establish committees composed of personnel from the local minority nationalities as a department of the provincial and county governments to manage matters related to them, regulate relations between the nationalities, and they should have positions in the provincial and county government committees. Third, respect the culture, religion, and customs of the various minority nationalities. Not only should they not be forced to learn the Han language, but they should also be assisted in developing cultural education using the languages of their own nationalities. Fourth, correct the existing Great Han chauvinism and advocate that the Han people treat all nationalities with an equal attitude, so that they become increasingly friendly and close, and at the same time, prohibit any insulting or contemptuous language, words, and actions towards them. On the one hand, the above policies should be implemented by the various minority nationalities themselves uniting to strive for their realization. On the other hand, the government should automatically implement them in order to thoroughly improve the mutual relations between the various nationalities in the country and truly achieve unity for the purpose of external defense. The old methods of appeasement and control will not work."

    Comrade Stalin said at the Congress of People's Representatives of the Soviet Kirghiz Autonomous Oblast in 1920: "The national autonomy discussed here can be understood in this way, that in all administrative organs, there are people of your own, who know your language, your living habits, this is the meaning of autonomy. Autonomy must teach you to walk on your own legs, this is the purpose of autonomy." Subsequently, in his 1923 article "The National Factor in Party Building and State Building," Comrade Stalin also proposed: "Not only schools, but all organs, whether Party or Soviet, should be gradually nationalized, so that they operate in a language easily understood by the masses, and that they perform their duties under conditions that adapt to national life."

    These are the clearest, most concise, and most profound explanations regarding the nationalization of autonomous organs. One can imagine that in a region that has declared the implementation of regional autonomy, if it is not dominated by minority personnel, but is instead monopolized by Han cadres; if the local nationality's language (if there is a written language) is not used as the main tool for the autonomous organs to exercise their functions and powers, but only the Han language is used; if national forms are not respected and utilized, but are instead rejected, then what kind of national regional autonomy is that?

    The nationalization of autonomous organs is an issue that requires a relatively long period of effort to fully resolve. It is neither possible nor should it be demanded that it be fully realized in one morning; however, it is entirely necessary and possible to shorten this process as much as possible. Over the years, the national autonomous regions and their higher-level Party and government leading organs have carried out a great deal of work in cultivating ethnic cadres, developing ethnic languages, and appropriately applying national forms, and have achieved great results. However, it must be pointed out that some national autonomous regions have many shortcomings in this regard during and after the establishment process, and some of these shortcomings are very serious. For example, some Han cadres monopolize and replace ethnic minority cadres, leaving ethnic minority cadres with positions but no power; some Han cadres do not sufficiently respect the right of minority peoples to "be masters of their own affairs" in managing their own national internal affairs, and some cadres even seriously infringe upon this right; individual autonomous regions with written languages have not yet used ethnic languages as tools for exercising their functions and powers; the phenomenon of disrespecting the religious beliefs, customs, and national forms of minority nationalities is relatively common; and some relevant higher-level people's governments do not have enough respect for the autonomous rights of the autonomous regions, and even less for earnestly helping them to exercise their autonomous rights. All of these shortcomings and errors are caused by the fact that some Han cadres do not understand or attach importance to this core issue in the national regional autonomy policy, namely, the nationalization of autonomous organs; and this lack of understanding and attention is often inseparable from the Great Han chauvinism or remnants of Great Han chauvinism that exist in the ideological consciousness of these Han cadres. The inspection of the implementation of national policies conducted nationwide starting in the autumn of 1952 has already inspected and corrected the shortcomings and errors in this regard. The relevant Party and government leading organs must continue to pay attention and earnestly carry out work in order to thoroughly correct these shortcomings and errors and expedite the gradual nationalization of the autonomous organs.

    Of course, the realization of the nationalization of the autonomous organs of various nationalities is inseparable from strengthening the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the higher-level people's governments over the autonomous regions, and is inseparable from the help and support of cadres and people of the Han and other nationalities. If it is believed that "being masters of one's own affairs" or "nationalization" means that the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party is no longer needed, that attention can be ignored to the unified laws and systems of the country, that it is no longer necessary to obey the unified leadership of the Central People's Government and the leadership of the higher-level people's governments, or that the help and support of the Han people and cadres are no longer needed, then it is obviously wrong and must be prevented and corrected.

    The implementation of national regional autonomy is not equivalent to the fundamental resolution of ethnic issues; to fundamentally resolve ethnic issues, it is necessary, based on feasible conditions, to actively help minority nationalities develop their political, economic, and cultural undertakings, so that they can gradually reach the level of advanced nationalities. At present, economic work, especially agricultural and pastoral production, should be strengthened. The establishment of national autonomous regions is very beneficial to the development of the political, economic, and cultural undertakings of the minority nationalities within the autonomous regions. Over the past three or four years, the relevant higher-level Party committees and people's governments have helped the autonomous regions do a lot of work in this regard and have achieved certain results; however, some regions have not done enough, especially in helping the autonomous regions develop economic construction. More needs to be done as much as possible. Comrade Stalin said in his article "The Formulation of the National Question": "But the working masses of these nations, because of their cultural and economic backwardness, are unable to fully enjoy the rights they have acquired... Precisely because of this, the proletariat of the victorious advanced nations needs to help, effectively and for a long time, the cultural and economic development of the backward nations, helping them to rise to the highest level of development, catching up with the nations that are ahead. Without this help, it is impossible for the workers of all nations and peoples to achieve peaceful coexistence and close cooperation within a unified world economy, and this peaceful coexistence and close cooperation are necessary for the complete victory of socialism." It can be seen from this that in order to fundamentally resolve the ethnic issues and to ensure the victory of our country's construction, we must carry out long-term arduous work in this area.

    The "Basic Summary of the Experience in Promoting National Regional Autonomy" points out: "The higher-level people's governments must care about the hardships of the minority peoples in the autonomous regions, especially the hardships of the minority peoples living in mountainous areas and other areas with poor natural and production conditions, because the people there have many difficult problems in production and life that urgently require special care from the higher-level people's governments and strive to help them solve those urgent material needs for life and production." "Based on different situations and possible conditions, help minority nationalities develop their economies and cultures, and gradually improve their material and cultural living conditions." This is very important.

    Here, we must prevent two kinds of deviations. One is failing to care about the hardships of the minority peoples and failing to pay attention to helping minority nationalities develop their economic and cultural undertakings. This attitude is wrong and must be overcome and corrected. The other deviation is failing to understand that our country's economic construction is only just beginning, and that for a considerably long period of time, the state will not be able to use great efforts to help minority nationalities develop rapidly in the economic and cultural aspects, and therefore making blind and excessive demands. This is also wrong and must be prevented. However, based on the strength of the state and the current situation and conditions in ethnic regions, it is entirely necessary and possible to carry out some construction work in the economic and cultural aspects of minority nationalities, especially to actively help minority nationalities develop agricultural and pastoral production, in order to gradually and appropriately improve the lives of minority peoples. The relevant Party committees and people's governments should strengthen the work in this area.

    Our country's ethnic work, along with the advancement of our motherland, has achieved great success. This is due to the fact that the relevant Party committees and people's governments at all levels and thousands of working cadres have implemented correct ethnic policies and worked hard. We should consolidate these achievements, overcome the shortcomings that still exist, and further improve the work of national regional autonomy, and strive to further implement the policy of national regional autonomy!

### 进一步贯彻民族区域自治的政策

    进一步贯彻民族区域自治的政策
    民族区域自治是毛泽东同志运用马克思列宁主义关于民族问题的学说来解决我国民族问题的基本政策。中华人民共和国成立以来，中国共产党和中央人民政府就以极大的重视和关怀来推行民族区域自治。一九五二年八月中央人民政府公布了“中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要”以后，全国各地推行民族区域自治的工作更获得了很大的进展和显著的成绩。截至一九五三年三月，在全国范围内已建立了相当于县级和县级以上的民族自治区四十七个，此外还建立了许多相当于区级和乡级的民族自治区。各自治区内的少数民族人口已达一千万人以上。现在全国各地建立民族自治区的工作，还在继续进行，今后还将有许多新的民族自治区建立起来。
    民族区域自治政策的推行，使有一定聚居区的少数民族实现了他们在中央人民政府统一领导下对本民族内部事务“当家作主”的权利，普遍而显著地获得了良好的效果，增强了各族人民的政治积极性、自动性和爱国主义精神；加强了民族间和各民族内部的团结；密切了自治机关和人民之间的联系；逐渐促进了各少数民族政治、经济和文化的发展。其中特别显著的是少数民族人民中爱国主义精神的增涨和民族团结的加强。他们积极参加镇压反革命、剿灭土匪、抗美援朝和保卫祖国边防等重大行动。他们对中国共产党、毛主席、中央人民政府日益增涨着衷心的爱戴和拥护。他们说：“过去我们没有家，现在毛主席给我们安了家。”“过去我们打仗也争不来的东西，毛主席给我们了。”他们称颂毛主席是“冬天的太阳”、“夏天的雨”。各自治区的少数民族人民增强了和汉族人民的友谊和对汉族的信任，认识了作为中国主体民族汉族的先进作用和领导作用；各民族内部的各地方、各部落、各教派相互之间的联系也密切了，团结也日益加强了。所有这些都证明了并且还在证明着民族区域自治制度的优越性，证明了并且还在证明着它的确是解决我国民族问题的钥匙。
    三、四年来，全国各地在推行民族区域自治的工作中所积累起来的经验是生动而丰富的，其中最基本的正如中央民族事务委员会第三次（扩大）会议在“关于推行民族区域自治经验的基本总结”中所提出的，这就是必须在一切工作中充分地估计各少数民族的特点和具体情况；必须加强、巩固民族间和民族内部的团结；必须逐步使自治机关民族化；必须帮助自治区逐步地行使其自治权利；必须在可能条件下尽力发展自治区的政治、经济、文化事业。在这些宝贵的经验中，目前值得特别注意的是自治机关民族化的问题和帮助自治区发展政治、经济和文化事业的问题。
    自治机关的民族化，是民族区域自治政策的核心问题。依照“中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要”有关各条的规定，自治机关的民族化包括自治机关应以实行区域自治的民族人员为主要成份组成；自治机关的具体形式，应依照实行区域自治的民族大多数人民以及与人民群众有联系的领袖人物的志愿；自治机关应采用一种在其自治区内通用的民族文字，为行使职权的主要工具；自治机关在其工作中，应注意运用民族形式。简单说来，自治机关的民族化就是：实行区域自治的民族，主要地以他们民族自己的干部，用他们自己的语言文字，并适当地运用他们自己的民族形式管理他们自己民族内部的事务。
    早在一九三八年十一月六日，毛泽东同志在中国共产党第六届中央委员会扩大的第六次全体会议上就曾提出：“第一，允许蒙、回、藏、苗、瑶、彝、番各民族与汉族有平等权利，在共同对日原则之下，有自己管理自己事务之权，同时与汉族联合建立统一的国家。第二，各少数民族与汉族杂居的地方，当地政府须设置由当地少数民族的人员组成的委员会，作为省县政府的一部门，管理和他们有关事务，调节各族间的关系，在省县政府委员中应有他们的位置。第三，尊重各少数民族的文化、宗教、习惯，不但不应强迫他们学汉文汉语，而且应赞助他们发展用各族自己言语文字的文化教育。第四，纠正存在着的大汉族主义，提倡汉人用平等态度和各族接触，使日益亲善密切起来，同时禁止任何对他们带侮辱性与轻视性的言语、文字与行动。上述政策，一方面，各少数民族应自己团结起来争取实现，一方面应由政府自动实施，才能彻底改善国内各族的相互关系，真正达到团结对外之目的，怀柔与羁縻的老办法是行不通了的。”
    斯大林同志一九二○年在苏联吉尔斯克省人民代表大会上说：“这里所谈的民族自治，可以如此了解，为的是一切管理机关中，站有你们的人，知道你们的语言，你们的生活习惯，这就是自治的意义。自治必须教会你们用自己的腿走路，这就是自治的目的。”随后斯大林同志在一九二三年“党的建设和国家建设中的民族因素”一文中又提出：“不仅要使学校，而且要使一切机关，不论党的或苏维埃的，逐渐民族化，使他们用群众所容易理解的语言来活动，使他们在适应民族生活的条件下执行职务。”
    这些就是关于自治机关民族化的最明白、最简要而又最深刻的说明。可以设想，在宣布了实行区域自治的地区，如果不是由少数民族人员为主，而是由汉族干部包办代替；不是以当地民族的语言文字（假如有文字的话）为自治机关行使职权的主要工具，而仅仅使用汉文汉语；不是尊重和运用民族形式，而是厌弃民族形式，那还算什么民族区域自治呢？
    自治机关的民族化，是一个需要较长时期的努力才能完全解决的问题，不可能也不应该要求在一个早晨就完全实现；但是，把这个过程尽量地缩短一些，则是完全必要的，也是可能的。几年以来，各民族自治区及其上级党政领导机关，在培养民族干部、发展民族语文和适当地运用民族形式各方面，进行了许多工作，并且得到了很大成绩。但是，必须指出，有些民族自治区在建立过程中和建立起来之后，在这一方面是存在着许多缺点的，其中有些缺点并且是很严重的。例如有的汉族干部包办代替、少数民族干部有职无权，某些汉族干部对少数民族人民在管理本民族内部事务上“当家作主”的权利是不够尊重的，有的干部甚至还严重地侵犯了这种权利；个别有民族文字的自治区，还没有把民族文字当作行使职权的工具；不尊重少数民族宗教信仰、风俗习惯及民族形式的现象，更是较多地存在着；若干有关的上级人民政府，对于自治区自治权利的尊重，也是很不够的，对于自治权利的行使，更缺乏认真的帮助。所有这些缺点和错误，都是因为有一些汉族干部对于民族区域自治政策中这一个核心的问题，即自治机关民族化的问题不了解或不重视而发生的；而这种不了解和不重视又往往是和这一些汉族干部思想意识上存在的大汉族主义或大汉族主义残余分不开的。一九五二年秋季开始的在全国范围内进行的关于民族政策执行情况的检查，已经检查并纠正了这方面的缺点和错误，各有关的党政领导机关，必须继续注意，认真地进行工作，以彻底地纠正这些缺点和错误，尽速使各自治机关逐步民族化。
    当然，实现各民族自治机关的民族化，是和加强中国共产党及上级人民政府对自治区的领导分不开的，是和汉族或其他民族的干部及人民的帮助与支持分不开的。如果认为“当家作主”或“民族化”就可以不需要中国共产党来领导了，可以不注意国家统一的法令和制度，可以不那么服从中央人民政府的统一领导和上级人民政府的领导了，可以不需要汉族人民和干部的帮助和支持了，那很显然都是错误的，必须注意加以防止和纠正。
    民族区域自治的实行，还不等于民族问题的根本解决；要根本解决民族问题，必须依据可能条件，积极帮助少数民族人民发展他们的政治、经济和文化事业，使他们能逐步达到先进民族的水平。目前尤应加强经济工作，特别是农、牧业生产。民族自治区的建立，对于自治区内少数民族的政治、经济、文化事业的发展是非常有利的。三、四年来，在这一方面，各有关的上级党委和人民政府多已帮助自治区做了不少工作，有一定的成绩；但也有些地区还做得不够，特别是在帮助自治区发展经济建设方面，还做得不够，还需要尽可能多做一点。斯大林同志在“论民族问题的提法”一文中说：“但是这些民族的劳苦大众，由于自己文化与经济落后的缘故，无力充分地去享用他们所获得的权利。……正因为如此，所以很需要胜利的先进民族的无产阶级去帮助，而且有效地、长期地去帮助落后民族文化与经济的发展，帮助他们高升到最高的发展水平，赶上走在前边的民族。没有这种帮助就不可能使各民族和人民的劳动者在统一的世界经济之内实行和平共居和亲密合作，而这种和平共居和亲密合作，却为社会主义的彻底胜利所必要。”由此可见，为了从根本上解决民族问题，为了保证我们国家建设事业的胜利，我们必须在这方面进行长期的艰苦的工作。
    “关于推行民族区域自治经验的基本总结”中指出：“各上级人民政府必须关怀自治区少数民族人民的疾苦，特别是那些居住在山区及其他自然条件和生产条件很差的地区的少数民族人民的疾苦，因为那里的人民在生产和生活方面的困难问题很多，亟需上级人民政府予以特别关怀，尽力帮助他们解决那些迫切的物质生活和生产的需要。”“应依据不同情况和可能条件，帮助少数民族发展其经济和文化，逐步地改善其物质、文化生活状况”。这是非常重要的。
    在这里，我们要防止两种偏向。一种是不关怀少数民族人民的疾苦和不注意帮助少数民族发展经济和文化事业，这种态度是错误的，是必须克服和纠正的。另一种偏向是不了解我们国家的经济建设才在开始，在一个相当长的时间内，国家还不可能用很大的力量帮助少数民族在经济、文化方面迅速地发展，因而提出盲目的过高的要求，这也是错误的，也是必须防止的。但根据国家的力量和民族地区目前的情况和条件，在少数民族经济、文化方面举办一些建设工作，首先是积极地帮助少数民族发展农业和牧业生产，以便逐步地、适当地改善少数民族人民的生活，却是完全必要的，也是可能的。各有关的党委和人民政府应该加强这一方面的工作。
    我们国家的民族工作，随同我们祖国的前进，已经得到了巨大的成就，这是由于有关的各级党委、各级人民政府和千万个工作干部执行了正确的民族政策，艰苦奋斗所得来的。我们应该巩固这些成绩，克服仍然存在的缺点，进一步做好民族区域自治工作，为进一步贯彻民族区域自治的政策而奋斗！
