Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 8th: The construction of the new large rolling mill at Anshan Iron and Steel Company is now entering a tense completion phase. In a few months, the long-awaited rails, bridge beams, and large structural steel will begin to be shipped from this factory to supply construction sites across the country.

Currently, all construction projects are proceeding with great intensity. From inside to outside the factory, from underground to the roof, all civil construction, metal structures, electrical installations, machine installations, and various pipeline projects have been fully launched. As the end approaches, any delay or failure to guarantee the quality of these projects will seriously affect the completion of other projects. To ensure the successful completion of the entire project, a labor competition to guarantee project quality and strive for early completion has been launched at the large rolling mill site. Many workers have proposed the slogan of striving to trial roll the first standard steel billet by the end of October.

Basic construction workers and technicians at the large rolling mill site have demonstrated a high degree of initiative and creativity in the construction process. From May to the end of August, all engineering progress plans, except for industrial pipeline engineering, have been completed or overfulfilled according to plan. Civil construction workers created advanced experiences such as the division-of-labor trapezoidal flow excavation method and the half-standard bricklaying method, and overcame the difficulties brought to the construction by the continuous heavy rains in mid-to-late August with the bravery and perseverance of the working class. They not only guaranteed the quality but also overfulfilled the August task by 41.76 percent.

Currently, at the large rolling mill site, a huge red factory building has been largely completed. A large number of workers are installing the final part of the prefabricated panels on the roof, applying cement and a layer of asphalt to prevent rainwater intrusion. Painters are painting the various control consoles, corridors, and steel beam supports, making the factory more clean and comfortable. After basically completing the metal structure installation project, the metal structure department, in addition to leaving a few workers to install steel windows and other scattered finishing projects, has organized most of the workers to participate in the installation of various pipelines outside the factory. More than 10,000 tons of rolling mill machinery have been largely installed, and workers are carrying out adjustments and cleaning work. In the heating furnace workshop, with the help of Soviet experts, after several test runs, the superiority of Soviet technology and machinery has been proven. The cable from the central substation to the main electrical room of the large rolling mill has been connected. Once the battery room project is completed, power can be turned on. Soon, the DC generator and large motor connected to the main rolling mill will be able to rotate rapidly with the push of a button. At that time, these giant rolling mills can begin trial operation. The various pipeline projects outside the factory are proceeding very intensively. Some workers have begun to clean the ditches and backfill soil on the crisscrossing underground pipeline trenches, preparing to build the roads and railways needed for production.

    鞍钢大型轧钢厂工程进入竣工阶段
    【新华社鞍山八日电】鞍山钢铁公司新建大型轧钢厂的工程，目前已进入紧张的竣工阶段。再过几个月，人们长期盼望着的各种钢轨、桥梁和大型建筑钢材，就要开始从这个工厂里运送出来，供应全国各地的建设。
    目前，各项工程建设进行得十分紧张。从厂里到厂外，从地下到屋面，一切土木建筑、金属结构、电气安装、机器安装和各种管道工程都已全面摊开了。临近结束时期，这些工程无论那一项延期或不能保证质量，都会严重地影响其他工程的完工。为了保证整个工程的胜利完成，大型轧钢厂工地开展了保证工程质量和争取提前完工的劳动竞赛。许多工人在竞赛中，都提出争取到十月底试轧出第一根标准钢管坯的口号。
    大型轧钢厂工地的基本建设工人和技术人员们，在工程建设中发挥了高度的积极性和创造性。从五月到八月底的总工程进度计划，除了工业管道工程以外，其他一切工程都已按计划完成或超额完成了。土木建筑工人们创造了分工梯形流水挖土法，和半边标准砌砖法等先进经验，并以工人阶级勇敢和坚忍的劳动，战胜了八月中旬和下旬连续的大雨给施工带来的困难。他们不仅保证了质量，并且超额百分之四十一点七六完成了八月份的任务。
    目前在大型轧钢厂的工地上，一座巨大的红色的厂房工程大体上已经造好，大批的工人们正在屋顶上安装最后一部分预制板，抹上水泥和涂上一层沥青，以防雨水的侵袭。漆工们正为各个操纵台、走廊和钢梁的支柱涂抹油漆，把厂房装饰得更加整洁，舒适。金属结构部门在基本完成金属结构安装工程后，除留下少数工人安装钢窗等一些零星的结尾工程，已把大部分工人组织起来参加了突击厂外各种管道的安装工程。一万多吨的轧钢机器已大体安装就绪，工人们正进行调整和清洗工作。加热炉车间在苏联专家帮助下，经过多次试车，证明了苏联的技术和机器的优越性。由中央变电所通向大型轧钢厂主电室的电缆已经接通，等到蓄电池室工程完工后就可通电。不久，连接着主要轧钢机的直流发电机和大马达，只要一按电钮就能迅速旋转起来。那时，这些巨型的轧钢机就可以开始试车了。厂外各种管道工程进行得十分紧张，有部分工人已开始在纵横交错的地下管道沟上清扫沟渠和回填土，准备修筑生产时所需要的公路和铁道。
