    Congratulations on the Eighth Anniversary of the Victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan
    Telegram from Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou to Malenkov and Molotov

    To Comrade Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union;
    To Comrade Molotov, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union:

    On the occasion of the eighth anniversary of the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, we, on behalf of the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, extend warm congratulations to the Soviet people and the Soviet armed forces.

    In the long and arduous war of resistance against the aggression of Japanese imperialism, and in the final battle to defeat Japanese imperialism, the Chinese people have consistently received the support and assistance of the Soviet people. Especially in 1945, because of the participation of the Soviet armed forces, together with the Chinese people, Japanese imperialism was defeated and final victory was achieved.

    After the establishment of the People's Republic of China, thanks to the signing of the Sino-Soviet treaty of friendship, alliance and mutual assistance, the unbreakable friendship between China and the Soviet Union has been and is being consolidated and developed. This great friendship has now become a strong guarantee for peace in the Far East and world peace.

    Here, we must also mention that the fraternal assistance given by the Soviet Union to the Chinese people is an important factor in the rapid recovery of the Chinese economy and its embarking on the road of planned construction.

    Recently, the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement is clearly a new and significant achievement of the entire peace and democracy camp in its efforts to strive for peace and stop new wars. This new and significant achievement has already helped to ease the overall world situation, and will also help the Japanese people in their efforts to establish normal relations with the countries of the Far East, in order to prevent the resurgence of Japanese imperialist aggression.

    Long live the permanent cooperation between China and the Soviet Union in the just cause of defending peace in the Far East

    祝贺抗日战争胜利八周年
    毛主席周总理致马林科夫莫洛托夫电苏联部长会议主席马林科夫同志：苏联外交部部长莫洛托夫同志
    当此抗日战争胜利的第八周年之际，我们谨代表中国人民和中国人民解放军向苏联人民和苏联武装部队致以热烈的祝贺。
    中国人民在反抗日本帝国主义侵略的长期艰苦战争中以及在最后击败日本帝国主义的战斗中，自始至终获得了苏联人民的支持和援助。特别是在一九四五年，因为苏联武装部队的参战，和中国人民一起，击败了日本帝国主义，取得了最后的胜利。
    中华人民共和国建立之后，由于中苏友好同盟互助条约的签订，中国与苏联牢不可破的友谊已经并正在日益巩固和发展。这种伟大的友谊现在已成为远东和平与世界和平的坚强保证。
    在这里，我们还要提到的，就是苏联给予中国人民的兄弟般的帮助，乃是中国经济迅速恢复和走上有计划建设道路的重要因素。
    最近，朝鲜停战协定的签字，显然是整个和平民主阵营在争取和平、制止新战争的努力中所获得的新的重大的成就。这一新的重大的成就业已有助于整个世界形势的开始和缓，同时，也将有助于日本人民要求与远东各国建立正常关系的努力，以便防止日本帝国主义侵略之再起。
    中苏两国在保卫远东和世界和平的正义事业中永久合作万岁！
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府主席  毛泽东
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府政务院总理兼外交部部长  周恩来
    一九五三年九月二日  于北京
