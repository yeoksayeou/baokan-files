Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Adenauer government’s four years of rule have brought profound economic disaster to the people of West Germany.

According to West German official statistics, the number of unemployed in West Germany has more than doubled during Adenauer’s four years in power. Professor Siegbert Kahn, director of the Economic Research Institute of the German Democratic Republic, estimates that the West German army of unemployed currently numbers at least 3.5 million. Including their families, the number is even more staggering. According to figures released by the Bonn government's press office, as of last year, 17,447,000 people in West Germany, or about one-third of the population, were living on meager unemployment benefits and other subsidies.

According to statistics from the Kiel and Munich economic research institutes in West Germany, the minimum living expenses for a family of four in West Germany are 420 marks per month. However, 60 percent of West German families currently have an average monthly income of less than 250 marks.

The constant rise in prices has made the already meager income of the working people even more inadequate. From 1949 to March 1953, the price increases in West Germany were as follows: sugar up 17 percent, butter up 26 percent, meat up 28 percent, and bread up 52 percent.

At the same time, as a result of the Adenauer government's active pursuit of a war policy, the tax burden on the West German people is constantly increasing. According to Bonn official statistics, from 1948 to 1953, income tax and consumer goods taxes have more than doubled. Currently, the average West German family must pay 730 marks in taxes each year. The vast majority of these taxes are used for rearmament. This year, 68 percent of the Bonn government's total budget expenditure is directly or indirectly used for war preparations.

Due to rising prices and increased taxes, the real wages of West German workers are now less than 70 percent of what they were before the war, and the average wage of West German workers is only 55 percent of that of Belgian workers.

The situation for farmers and handicraftsmen is even worse. From 1949 to April 1953, West German farmers' debts increased from 2 billion marks to more than 5 billion marks, two-thirds of which was owed by small and medium-sized farmers. At the same time, West German agriculture is also suffering from the destruction caused by massive imports of grain from foreign countries, mainly the United States. Currently, West German grain imports have increased more than threefold since Adenauer came to power. In addition, 500,000 hectares of West German farmers' land have been requisitioned for military use. Bonn's Minister of Agriculture, Nikolas, also admitted that 700,000 West German farmers are threatened with bankruptcy and ruin.

The plight of West German intellectuals is also becoming increasingly tragic. According to Bonn's official figures alone, 22,000 scientific workers and teachers, and 15,000 engineers and technicians are unemployed. According to the West German bourgeois newspaper "Aachen News," a professor who was extremely poor and asked for help received this reply from a government official: "I can cite many famous scientists who are in the same situation as you. These professors pick mushrooms in the woods and sell them to passengers in passing cars."

While the West German people are generally impoverished, capitalists are making huge fortunes. Stocks in military industries closely related to American monopoly capital and the Adenauer government have risen by more than 400 percent.

    阿登纳罪恶的统治使西德人民普遍贫困化
    据新华社讯：阿登纳政府四年来的统治，在经济上给西德人民带来了深重的灾难。
    据西德官方的统计，在阿登纳统治的四年中，西德的失业人数已经增加了一倍多。德意志民主共和国经济研究所所长西格柏特·卡恩教授估计，目前，西德失业大军最少有三百五十万人。连同他们的家属，数字还更加惊人。据波恩政府新闻局公布的数字，还在去年，西德就有一千七百四十四万七千人，即约三分之一的人，是靠为数极少的失业补助金和其他补助金糊口。
    据西德基尔和慕尼黑两个经济研究所的统计，在西德，一个四口之家的生活费每月最低也得有四百二十马克。可是西德现在有百分之六十的家庭平均每月收入还不到二百五十马克。
    物价的不断上涨使得劳动人民本已微薄的收入更加不敷应用。从一九四九年到一九五三年三月，西德物价上涨的情况如下：糖价上涨百分之十七，牛油上涨百分之二十六，肉类上涨百分之二十八，面包上涨百分之五十二。
    同时，由于阿登纳政府积极推行战争政策的结果，西德人民的赋税负担正不断加重。根据波恩官方的统计，从一九四八年到一九五三年，所得税和消费品的税额已经增加了一倍多。目前，西德每一个家庭平均每年须缴纳七百三十马克的赋税。这些税款绝大部分是用于重整军备。今年波恩政府全部预算支出的百分之六十八是直接或间接用于战争准备方面的。
    由于物价的上涨和赋税的增加，西德工人的实际工资现在还不到战前的百分之七十，西德工人的平均工资只等于比利时工人的百分之五十五。
    农民和手工业者的情况甚至更加恶劣。从一九四九年到一九五三年四月这一时期，西德农民的债务从二十亿马克增加到五十亿马克以上，其中三分之二是中小农户所负的债务。同时，西德的农业还遭受着外国，主要是美国大量进口粮食的摧残。目前，西德进口的粮食已经比阿登纳上台时增加了三倍多。另外，还有五十万公顷西德农民的土地被征作军用。波恩政府农业部长尼可拉斯也承认，西德已有七十万农户受到丧家破产的威胁。
    西德知识分子的遭遇也愈来愈悲惨。仅据波恩官方的材料，就有二万二千个科学工作者和教师、一万五千个工程师和技术人员失业。据西德资产阶级的报纸“亚琛新闻”报道，一个穷到极点请求帮助的教授得到政府官员这样的答复：“我可以举出很多有名的科学家，他们的境况和你一样。这些教授在树林里拣蘑菇，卖给过路汽车上的乘客。”
    在西德人民普遍贫困化的同时，资本家却大发其财。与美国垄断资本和阿登纳政府有密切关系的军事工业的股票已上涨了百分之四百以上。
