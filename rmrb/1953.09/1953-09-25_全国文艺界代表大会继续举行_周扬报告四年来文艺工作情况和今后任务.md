The Second National Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Workers continued on the 24th. Zhou Yang, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, gave a report on the literary and artistic work in the past four years and future tasks. Representatives from major administrative regions such as East China, Northwest China, Northeast China, and Southwest China reported on the literary and artistic work in their respective regions.

Zhou Yang first gave a general account of the literary and artistic work since the First National Congress of Literary and Art Workers in 1949. He said that in the past four years, literary and artistic work has made great progress under the guidance of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic direction. New people's literature and art have basically replaced the old, decadent, and backward feudal and bourgeois literature and art. Writers and artists have strived to express the images of workers, peasants, and soldiers in their creations, expressing their new faces and new qualities. The themes of praising the great motherland and defending world peace have been strongly and vividly expressed in literary and artistic works. New worker-peasant and ethnic minority writers have emerged in the literary and artistic ranks. At the same time, reforms have been carried out on folk and traditional ethnic arts. Opera reform has gained experience, and opera performers have shown great progress.

However, on the whole, the literary and artistic cause is still far behind the cause of the entire people and the country, and far from meeting the needs of the people.

Zhou Yang pointed out that the development of literature and art in the past four years has gone through a series of ideological struggles. In 1951, the Communist Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao launched the criticism of the film "The Life of Wu Xun," which gave a powerful rebuff to the bourgeois ideological invasion of literature and art in a timely manner, and also gave literary and art workers, especially Party literary and art workers, a profound and unforgettable education. The struggle against various manifestations of bourgeois ideology is a long-term task for future literary and artistic work. On the other hand, we must oppose the tendency of conceptualization and formulaization in literary and artistic creation. This tendency is unconscious for most writers, mainly because they do not have a deep and comprehensive understanding of life, and have not fully mastered the creative methods and literary techniques for expressing life. The narrow and simplistic understanding of the relationship between literature and art and politics by some leaders of literary and artistic work has also contributed to this tendency.

Zhou Yang criticized certain crude attitudes manifested in the leadership of literary and artistic work, such as leading creation in a simple administrative manner. At the same time, after affirming the achievements of literary and artistic criticism in the past two or three years, he pointed out the current deviations in criticism work, mainly that some criticisms lack a positive attitude of support and encouragement for new literary and artistic creations, with more accusations than help, and the combination of stern criticism and enthusiastic encouragement is lacking. Some criticisms often do not proceed from reality, but from dogmatic formulas.

The report pointed out that the central task of literary and artistic work in the future is to further develop literary and artistic creation, and gradually improve it in the direction of socialist realism on the current basis. Socialist realism is the highest criterion for our entire literary and artistic creation and criticism. The basic trend of the New Literature Movement that began with the May Fourth Movement is to move towards socialist realism. Lu Xun became a great pioneer of socialist realism in his later creative activities. At present, China is gradually and extensively carrying out socialist transformation, and further studying and mastering the method of socialist realism has more urgent and important significance. However, a hasty attitude and narrow style are harmful. Every writer and artist reaches socialist realism according to their different life experiences and creative paths. At the same time, socialist realism must guarantee the maximum freedom for writers in the selection of subjects, in the expression of forms, and in personal style.

Current literary and artistic creation should focus on expressing new characters and new ideas, while opposing the enemies of the people and all backward phenomena within the people. In real life, new characters are emerging. And the most sublime task of literary and artistic work is precisely to express completely new types of characters, who must be incompatible with the bad influences left over from the old society. Literary and artistic creation should not only express the present of our people, but also look forward to their future. In order to highlight the brilliant qualities of a heroic figure, writers can and should consciously ignore some of his unimportant shortcomings, so that he becomes an ideal figure in the work. Our realists must also be revolutionary idealists. Writers and artists must stand in the advanced ranks of the people and fight alongside the people to support new things and oppose old things.

The report also put forward the task of systematically sorting out and studying the national literary and artistic heritage. Literary and art workers must learn the spirit of realism and artistic skills from their great national heritage, and at the same time, they must learn from the advanced experiences of foreign countries to enrich our own traditions and absorb what we lack. Literary and art workers must strive to master artistic skills and strive to create new national styles.

The report also put forward the task of further strengthening popularization work. Writers and artists should pay attention to all forms in literature and art that are conducive to popularization, such as movies, dramas, etc., and strive to adopt these forms. At the same time, it pointed out the importance of popular literary and artistic creation and the need to further improve the level of popular literary and artistic works. Professional literary and art workers should maintain fixed contact with the amateur artistic activities of workers and peasants, help them create and perform, and discover and cultivate literary and artistic talents among the working people.

The report concluded by proposing to strengthen and reorganize the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, various associations, and local federations of literary and art circles to meet the needs of developing creative undertakings.

Representatives Xia Yan from East China, Ke Zhongping from Northwest China, Cao Ming from Northeast China, and Sha Ting from Southwest China all pointed out in their speeches that the literary and artistic work in various regions has achieved certain results under the direction of Chairman Mao to serve workers, peasants, and soldiers, but literary and artistic creation is still far behind the needs of the people. In the future, we must do everything possible to encourage and develop literary and artistic creation from all aspects.

Ke Zhongping's speech also specifically mentioned that literary and art workers of various ethnic groups in the Northwest are now united in a big family. Talented literary and art workers of various ethnic groups have created many works that are deeply loved by the masses. He introduced a folk singer from the Northwest who attended the conference and recited a folk song praising Chairman Mao at the meeting. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 全国文艺界代表大会继续举行  周扬报告四年来文艺工作情况和今后任务

    全国文艺界代表大会继续举行
    周扬报告四年来文艺工作情况和今后任务
    中国文学艺术工作者第二次代表大会二十四日继续举行大会。中华全国文学艺术界联合会副主席周扬作了关于四年来文学艺术工作情况和今后任务的报告；华东、西北、东北、西南等大行政区代表报告了各区的文学艺术工作。
    周扬首先概括地叙述了一九四九年第一次全国文学艺术工作者代表大会以后，全国文学艺术工作的情况。他说：四年来文学艺术工作，在毛泽东文艺方针的指导之下获得了很大的发展。新的人民的文学艺术已在基本上代替了旧的、腐朽的、落后的封建阶级和资产阶级的文学艺术。文学家、艺术家努力地在自己的创作中表现了工农兵的形象，表现了他们的新的面貌和新的品质。歌颂伟大祖国和保卫世界和平的主题，在文艺作品中得到了强烈的鲜明的表现。在文艺队伍中出现了新的工农的和少数民族的写作者。同时对民间流行的民族传统的艺术，进行了改革。戏曲改革已取得经验，戏曲艺人表现了极大的进步。
    但是整个说来，文学艺术事业同整个人民和国家的事业相比，同人民的需要相比，还是远远地落后的。
    周扬指出，四年来文学艺术的发展是经历了一连串的思想斗争的。一九五一年共产党中央和毛主席所发起的对电影“武训传”的批判，及时地给了文艺上的资产阶级思想的侵袭以有力的回击，同时也给了文艺工作者特别是党的文艺工作者以极深刻的难忘的教育。对资产阶级思想的各种表现进行斗争，是今后文艺工作的一个长期的任务。另一方面，在文艺创作上必须反对概念化、公式化的倾向。这种倾向，对大多数作家来说，是不自觉的，主要是由于他们没有深刻地全面地认识和理解生活，没有充分掌握表现生活的创作方法和文学技巧的原故。文艺工作的某些领导者对于文艺与政治的关系的狭隘的、简单化的了解也助长了这种倾向。
    周扬批判了文艺工作的领导上所表现的某些粗暴态度，如用简单行政方式领导创作等现象。同时在肯定两三年来文艺批评工作的成绩之后，指出目前批评工作中的偏向，主要是有些批评对新的文艺创作缺乏积极支持和扶植的态度，指责多而帮助少，严正的批评没有和热情的鼓励结合起来。有些批评常常不是从实际出发，而是从教条公式出发。
    报告指出今后文学艺术工作的中心任务是进一步发展文学艺术创作，并在现在的基础上沿着社会主义现实主义方向逐步提高。社会主义现实主义是我们整个文学艺术创作和批评的最高准则。从“五四”开始的新文艺运动的基本趋势就是朝着社会主义现实主义前进的。鲁迅在他后期的创造活动中，成为社会主义现实主义的伟大先驱者。目前我国正在逐步地广泛地进行着社会主义的改造，进一步学习和掌握社会主义现实主义的方法就具有更迫切和更重要的意义。但是性急的态度和狭隘的作风是有害的。各个作家、艺术家都是按照他们各人不同的生活经历和创作道路来达到社会主义现实主义的。同时社会主义现实主义必须最大限度地保证作家在选择题材、在表现形式和个人风格上的自由。
    当前文艺创作应当着重表现新的人物和新的思想，同时反对人民的敌人，反对人民内部的一切落后现象。在现实生活中，新的人物正在涌现出来。而文艺工作最崇高的任务，恰恰是表现完全新型的人物，这种人物必须是和旧社会所遗留的坏影响水火不相容的。文艺创作不只要表现我们人民的今天，而且要展望到他们的明天。作家为要突出地表现一个英雄人物的光辉品质，可以而且应当有意识地忽略他的一些不重要的缺点，使之在作品中成为理想人物。我们的现实主义者必须同时是革命的理想主义者。作家、艺术家必须站在人民的先进行列，和人民一道，为拥护新事物和反对旧事物而斗争。
    报告中还提出了系统地整理和研究民族文学艺术遗产的任务。文艺工作者必须向自己伟大的民族遗产学习现实主义的精神和艺术技巧，同时又必须向外国的先进经验学习，以丰富我们自己的传统，吸收我们所缺乏的东西。文艺工作者必须努力掌握艺术技巧，努力创造新的民族风格。
    报告中又提出了进一步加强普及工作的任务。作家、艺术家应当注意文学艺术中一切有利于普及的形式，如电影、戏剧等，并努力采用这些形式。同时指出通俗文艺创作的重要性及进一步提高通俗文艺作品水平的必要。专业文艺工作者应当和工农群众的业余艺术活动保持固定联系，帮助他们创作和表演，并从中发现和培养劳动人民中的文学艺术天才。
    报告的最后提出了加强和改组全国文联和各个协会及各地方文联的组织，以适应发展创作事业的需要。
    华东区代表夏衍、西北区代表柯仲平、东北区代表草明、西南区代表沙汀在讲话中都指出：各地文学艺术工作在毛主席所指示的为工农兵服务的方向下获得了一定的成绩，但文艺创作仍远落后于人民的需要。今后必须尽一切力量，从各方面来鼓励和发展文学艺术的创作。
    柯仲平的发言还特别提到了西北各民族的文艺工作者今天已团结在一个大家庭里。各民族的有天才的文艺工作者创作了许多深受群众喜爱的作品。他介绍了一位出席大会的西北民间歌手在会上朗诵了一首歌颂毛主席的民歌。　（新华社）
