    A Record of the Restoration of the Jianlong Reservoir
    Xiao Qi, Jiang Qingzhao

    The Jianlong Reservoir, located at the junction of Pingyuan County and Shunan County in South Pyongan Province, Korea, is one of Korea's famous irrigation facilities. It has a circumference of more than 30 kilometers and a storage capacity of 34.12 million cubic meters, irrigating more than 3,400 hectares of land. For 23 years, it has been a guarantee of bumper harvests for farmers in this area. However, such a peaceful facility was actually described as a "military target" by the US aggressor air force and brutally destroyed. On May 13th and 14th of this year, the US aggressors dispatched more than 100 aircraft sorties and dropped more than 500 bombs on the Jianlong Reservoir, blowing a 140-meter-wide gap in the huge dam. The resulting flood inundated 4,800 hectares of crops in Shunan, Pingyuan, Datong counties and the suburbs of Pyongyang, turning hundreds of hectares of fertile land into beaches and rivers. More than 2,000 Korean families suffered severe disasters. More than 800 Korean people were drowned in the flood. The inhumane disaster-makers—the US aggressors—proudly boasted of their high level of human slaughtering skills, declaring: "North Korea will not be able to repair the bombed reservoir in three years."
    However, the despicable act of the US aggressors in creating disasters could not destroy the strong will of the heroic Korean people. At that time, the Korean government immediately took emergency measures, distributing large quantities of grain, seeds, and farm implements to help the disaster victims settle down and engage in production to overcome the famine. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army units stationed nearby also bravely carried out rescue operations at that time, and distributed a large amount of grain and clothing to relieve the Korean disaster victims. The affected Korean people also firmly and quickly carried out post-disaster recovery work.
    In order to help the Korean people quickly carry out production and construction, the Korean and Chinese People's forces began the arduous project of repairing the Jianlong Reservoir on May 23. A labor army composed of 6,000 Chinese People's Volunteers and 2,000 Korean People's Army soldiers, under the unified deployment of the Korean government, invested in this great and arduous restoration work.
    These were two heroic units that had just stepped down from the front line with full honors. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army unit was the unit where the immortal internationalist fighter Luo Shengjiao lived before his death. They severely struck the enemy on heroic positions such as Tiande Mountain and "Baldy Mountain", creating brilliant achievements. The Korean People's Army unit was the winner of the honorary title of "Guards Seoul Kim Chaek Division." They had inflicted heavy blows on the enemy on the south bank of the Han River. Now these two heroic units are fighting side by side again on the reconstruction front. When heroes meet, they are especially cordial. Korean People's Army soldiers warmly embraced the Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers and said: "Congratulations on your immortal feats in the battles of Tiande Mountain and 'Baldy Mountain' for our motherland and the cause of peace. Thank you for coming to help us repair the reservoir which is related to the lives of thousands of people."
    Intense labor began. On the construction site, the soldiers of the Korean and Chinese People's forces dug soil, loaded carts, filled soil, and dredged silt together intimately. They encouraged each other, learned from each other, and supported each other. When the Volunteer Army soldiers saw that the People's Army soldiers were too tired, they rushed to help; when the People's Army soldiers saw that the Volunteer Army soldiers were too tired when digging silt, they took the initiative to jump into the waist-deep silt to replace them. When Volunteer Army soldiers were injured during labor, People's Army soldiers immediately bandaged them. When there was a shortage of tools, they allocated them to each other. When enemy planes came to harass, the anti-aircraft gunners of the Korean and Chinese People's forces jointly conducted air defense operations. They shot down seven enemy planes in three days, protecting the safety of the construction site.
    In order to improve work efficiency, the Korean and Chinese People's forces launched a friendly labor competition on the construction site and launched a "create new records" movement. The Kang Bingzhu Model Company of the Korean People's Army increased its work efficiency by more than double in four days; the "automatic soil loading box" created by Volunteer Army soldier Chen Jixiang also increased the efficiency of soil loading by twelve times.
    In the first ten days after the start of construction, the Korean and Chinese People's forces built a temporary dam 2,400 meters long, 5 meters high, and 3 meters wide at the fastest speed, blocking the flood. Then, four main canals with a total length of 92 kilometers were repaired, and more than 2,800 hectares of drought-stricken rice fields were irrigated in a timely manner.
    Next, the Korean and Chinese People's forces immediately began the arduous project of rebuilding the permanent dam. Under the cover of the anti-aircraft artillery units, a rolling stream of people bustled on the construction site all day long; at night, it was illuminated like daytime by thousands of torches. The sound of car horns and labor songs filled the entire construction site. People carrying soil to the dam came and went in an endless stream, and cars loaded with various materials were speeding in groups... The soldiers had to travel an average of more than 70 li back and forth every day, carrying more than 4,000 catties of weight. In the hot weather, many soldiers fainted and got up again, and the car drivers often worked for several days and nights without rest.
    The rainy season brought great difficulties to the restoration project of the reservoir.
    The rain not only made the roads muddy, but also caused the water level to rise sharply because fourteen streams poured into the pool from the high mountains. Once, there were continuous torrential rains for several days and nights, and the speed of the rising pool water exceeded the progress of the project. It was clear that the water level was as level as the dam. At this time, Commander Zheng Bo of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army and Commander of a certain unit of the People's Army simultaneously issued the battle call to the troops: "Race against the flood!" "We will not withdraw until we defeat the flood!" The night was pitch black, and the soldiers lit torches to repair the dam overnight. Before long, the torches were extinguished by the rain, and the command post concentrated everyone's flashlights for use. The two commanders led everyone to load sandbags to block the flood in front of the roaring pool water, and after twelve hours of intense labor, they finally overcame the flood.
    In the intense rescue, the soldiers of the Korean and Chinese People's forces displayed a tenacious fighting spirit. Volunteer Army soldier Zhang Jixiang, who was wounded in the battle to attack "Baldy Mountain" and then continuously attacked four enemy bunkers, participated in the intense labor with his seriously injured body that had just recovered. He was so exhausted that his whole body was limp, but he still refused to go down to rest, and still tried to shout: "For the happy tomorrow of the Korean people, comrades! We must contribute more, sweat more!"
    The news of the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement further encouraged the soldiers of the Korean and Chinese People's forces who were working hard. They held a warm celebration meeting on the wide flood discharge gate square. At the meeting, the soldiers unanimously expressed that they would further improve the efficiency of the project and strive to complete the entire reservoir before the glorious liberation day of the Korean people on "August 15th" as a gift to victory.
    The soldiers' determination was realized. On August 14, the entire project of the reservoir was successfully completed according to the plan. For more than eighty days, the soldiers contributed their greatest strength. According to statistics, the Volunteer Army units alone dispatched more than 200,000 man-days, more than 1.3 million labor hours, transported more than 2 million cubic meters of soil, excavated 2,300 cubic meters of silt, built a central concrete dam of more than 11,200 meters, built 5,200 meters of canals and more than 47,000 meters of ring-pool roads.
    For more than eighty days, the Korean people, full of infinite joy, rushed to the construction site from all directions every day. They gave vegetables, cigarettes, apples and many other comfort items to the Korean and Chinese People's forces. Many art groups also came to the construction site to conduct comfort performances. Vice Premier of the Korean Cabinet Cui Changyi also personally came to the construction site to express his condolences. Korean old farmer Zhang Nanshan, whose entire property was washed away by the flood, said with tears in his eyes to the Volunteer Army soldiers at the construction site: "Children, you have worked hard! Please tell Chairman Mao and the Chinese people that our children and grandchildren will never forget you. We will repay your great kindness with the practical action of year after year of bumper harvests." With the completion of the reservoir, more than a dozen huge production assault teams in this area were formed.
    On August 17, a grand completion ceremony was held at the reservoir. Korean Cabinet Minister of Agriculture Park Wen-gyu read out Marshal Kim Il-sung's letter of thanks to the Volunteer Army units at the meeting. He also presented a huge banner to the Volunteer Army units on behalf of the Korean Cabinet. In order to commemorate the immortal feats of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, the people of South Pyongan Province also built a monument on the bank of the reservoir. The monument is engraved in Korean and Chinese with immortal words:
    "...Who destroyed the reservoir dam? It is the beastly American imperialists. Who helped us repair it? It is the brotherly Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The restoration of the reservoir is another new victory demonstrating the consolidated friendship and seamless unity between the people of Korea and China."

    见龙贮水池修复记
    萧琦、姜庆肇
    朝鲜平安南道平原郡和顺安郡交界处的见龙贮水池，是朝鲜著名的灌溉设施之一。它周长三十多公里，贮水量达三千四百十二万立方公尺，可灌溉三千四百多公顷土地。二十三年来，它一直是这一带农民丰收的保证。可是，这样一个和平设施，竟也被美国侵略军空军说成是“军事目标”，而加以残暴地破坏了。美国侵略者在今年五月十三、十四两日，派出了一百多架次飞机，向见龙贮水池投下了五百多颗炸弹，把巨大的堤坝炸开了一个一百四十公尺宽的缺口，使决堤的洪水淹没了顺安、平原、大同三个郡和平壤市郊区的四千八百公顷农作物，把数百公顷良田冲成了沙滩和河流。两千多户朝鲜人民受到了严重的灾害。八百名以上的朝鲜人民被洪水溺毙了。而灭绝人性的灾难制造者——美国侵略者却洋洋得意地夸耀他们屠杀人类的本领高强，宣称：“北朝鲜三年内无法修复被炸毁的贮水池。”
    但是，美国侵略者制造灾难的卑鄙行为，却无法摧毁英雄的朝鲜人民的坚强的意志。当时，朝鲜政府立即采取了紧急措施，发放了大批粮食、种籽和农具，帮助灾民安家，生产渡荒。驻在附近的中国人民志愿军部队，也在当时奋不顾身地进行了抢救，并散发了大批粮食和衣物，救济朝鲜灾民。受灾的朝鲜人民也坚强地、迅速地进行了善后的恢复工作。
    为了帮助朝鲜人民迅速地进行生产建设，朝中人民部队于五月二十三日便开始进行修复见龙贮水池的艰巨工程。六千个中国人民志愿军和两千个朝鲜人民军一起组成的劳动大军，在朝鲜政府统一布置下，投入了这个伟大而艰巨的修复工作。
    这是满载荣誉刚下火线的两支英雄部队。中国人民志愿军部队，是不朽的国际主义战士罗盛教生前所在的部队。他们在天德山、“老秃山”等英雄阵地上，沉重地打击了敌人，创立了辉煌的功绩。朝鲜人民军部队，是“近卫汉城金策师团”光荣称号的获得者。他们曾在汉江南岸使敌人遭受到惨重的打击。现在这两支英雄部队，又并肩战斗在恢复建设的战线上了。英雄相见，分外亲热。朝鲜人民军战士热情地拥抱着中国人民志愿军战士说：“祝贺你们在天德山和‘老秃山’战斗中为我们祖国为和平事业建立的不朽功勋，感谢你们现在又来帮助我们修复关系到万千人民生活的贮水池。”
    紧张的劳动开始了。在工地上，朝中人民部队的战士们，亲密地在一起挖土、装车、填土、挖淤泥……。他们彼此鼓励，互相学习，互相支援。志愿军战士见人民军战士太劳累了就抢着去帮忙；人民军战士见志愿军战士在掘淤泥时太辛苦了，便主动地跳下齐腰深的淤泥里去替换。志愿军战士在劳动时负了伤，人民军战士就立即给他包扎。工具缺乏，他们互相调配。敌机来侵扰，朝中人民部队的高射炮手们便联合对空作战。他们曾在三天内打落了七架敌机，保护了工地上的安全。
    为了提高作业效率，朝中人民部队在工地上展开了友谊的劳动竞赛，展开了“创造新纪录”运动。朝鲜人民军康丙洙模范中队在四天内作业效率提高了一倍多；志愿军战士陈吉祥创造的“自动装土箱”，也使装土的效率提高了十二倍。
    在开工后的头十天内，朝中人民部队就以最快的速度，修起了一条长二千四百公尺、高五公尺、宽三公尺的临时性堤坝，阻住了洪水。接着，又修复了四条长九十二公里的水渠干线，适时地灌溉了二千八百多公顷缺水的稻田。
    接着，朝中人民部队又立即开始重建永久性堤坝的艰巨工程。在高射炮部队的掩护下，工地上整日奔忙着滚滚的人流；夜晚，被千百枝火把照耀得像白天一样。汽车的喇叭声和劳动的歌声充满了整个工地。背土上堤的人们川流不息地来往着，装满了各种材料的汽车成群地在奔驰……。战士们每人每天平均要往返七十多华里，背重四千多斤。在炎热的天气里，有许多战士昏倒了又爬起来，汽车司机们也常常一连几昼夜不休息。
    雨季给贮水池的修复工程带来了极大的困难。
    雨水不仅使道路变得泥泞不堪，而且因为十四条涧水从高山倾泻入池，引起了水位暴涨。有一次狂风暴雨连续了数昼夜，池水猛涨的速度超过工程的进展，眼看水位就和堤坝一般平了。这时，志愿军某部指挥员郑波和人民军某部指挥员同时向部队发出了“和洪水赛跑！”“不战胜洪水不收兵！”的战斗号召。夜是漆黑的，战士们燃起了火把连夜抢修堤坝。不一会，火把被雨水浇灭了，指挥所便把大家的手电筒集中起来使用。两位指挥员在咆哮的池水面前率领着大家装土袋堵洪水，连续进行了十二时的紧张劳动，终于战胜了洪水。
    在紧张的抢修中，朝中人民部队战士们发挥了顽强的战斗精神。在攻打“老秃山”的战斗中负伤后又连续攻下了敌人四座地堡的志愿军战士张吉祥，在大雨中带着重伤初愈的身体，参加紧张的劳动。他疲乏得全身瘫软了，但他还拒绝下去休息，仍努力喊叫：“为了朝鲜人民幸福的明天，同志们！要多出一分力，多流一点汗呵！”
    朝鲜停战协定签订的消息，更加鼓舞了紧张劳动中的朝中人民部队战士们。他们在宽阔的泄洪闸广场上举行了热烈的庆祝大会。战士们在会上一致表示要进一步提高工程效率，争取在朝鲜人民光荣的解放日“八·一五”前把贮水池全部修好，作为向胜利的献礼。
    战士们的决心实现了。八月十四日，贮水池的全部工程按照计划胜利完工。八十多天来，战士们贡献了他们最大的力量。据统计，仅志愿军部队就出动了二十多万个人工，一百三十多万个劳动小时，运土两百多万立方公尺，挖掘淤泥两千三百立方公尺，筑中心凝土坝一万一千二百多公尺，建筑水渠干线五千二百公尺和环池公路四万七千多公尺。
    八十多天来，满怀着无限喜悦的朝鲜人民每天从四面八方奔向工地。他们把蔬菜、香烟和苹果等许多慰问品送给朝中人民部队。许多艺术团体也到工地上来进行慰问演出。朝鲜内阁副首相崔昌益也亲自到工地上来慰问。全部家产被洪水冲走的朝鲜老农民张南山含着眼泪，在工地上对志愿军战士说：“孩子们，你们辛苦了！请转告毛主席和中国人民吧，就说我们的子子孙孙都永远不会忘记你们。我们将用年年丰收的实际行动来报答你们的大恩情。”随着贮水池的完工，这一带十多个庞大的生产突击队组成了。
    八月十七日，贮水池举行了隆重的竣工典礼大会。朝鲜内阁农业相朴文圭在会上宣读了金日成元帅给志愿军部队的感谢信。他并代表朝鲜内阁献给志愿军部队巨幅锦旗。为了纪念中国人民志愿军的不朽功勋，平安南道的人民并在贮水池畔建筑了纪念碑。碑上用朝中两国文字刻着永垂千秋的词句：
  “……是谁破坏了水库堤坝？是野兽般的美帝国主义者。是谁帮助我们修复了它？是兄弟般的中国人民志愿军。水库的修复，是朝中两国人民之间巩固的友谊和无间的团结的又一新的胜利的表现。”
