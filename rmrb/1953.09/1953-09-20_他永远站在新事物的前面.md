    The Troublesome "Thirty Percent"
    Cultural learning has begun.
    Comrade Chen Shufu, Political Commissar of the Tashan Hero Regiment, had never been so distressed. Before him was a report from the regiment's cultural and educational office: in the initial stage of the language textbook teaching, 30 percent of the people were falling behind.
    "Thirty percent!" This number struck him like an alarm bell, making him uneasy.
    He was well aware of the urgent need to improve the cultural level of the troops. The image of Li Yanling, the deputy instructor of the Third Company, floated before his eyes. This old Tashan warrior fought like a tiger in the Liberation War, but after the national victory, he was worried that he could not handle the work of a modern national defense army company due to a lack of education. He recalled the distress of Zhang Shouyuan, the Ninth Company commander, in 1951 during military training, when he had difficulty reading the principles of shooting and could not attend classes. … The troops were advancing towards regularization and modernization, but they were blocked by the "culture" mountain. To seize this mountain, he knew that this was the requirement of the entire army and the hope of the people of the whole country. Now, the Party had entrusted this task to his regiment, and thousands of soldiers in the regiment were looking forward to him, but he could not come up with a solution – thirty percent falling behind! And this was the "Tashan Hero Regiment"! Where was the honor of the troops? Could it be that this heroic unit, which annihilated more than 10,000 enemies and repelled eleven days of continuous attacks by the enemy's land, sea, and air forces in the Tashan blocking battle, could not advance on the cultural front today? Thinking of this, Comrade Chen Shufu became even more uneasy, he had to be responsible for the Party's task and the honor of the troops. But he himself also had difficulties! He, who had only studied for three and a half years, was indeed "completely ignorant" of cultural education and was truly an "outsider"!
    Now, Chairman Mao's words rang in his ears: "Some of the things we are familiar with are about to become idle, and some of the things we are not familiar with are forcing us to do. … We must overcome difficulties, we must learn things we do not understand."

    First Be a Student, Then Be a Teacher
    Yes, we must learn things we do not understand, we must delve into it!
    At this moment, the deputy director of the Political Department of the Central South Military Region came to their troops to inspect the work. The deputy director asked Comrade Chen Shufu with concern:
    "What is your current cultural level?" Comrade Chen Shufu thought for a moment and replied, "Probably around the level of senior primary school." So the deputy director picked up a senior primary school language textbook and asked him to explain a few words and sentences, but he did not explain them completely.
    As a result, Comrade Chen Shufu saw the difficulties in front of him more clearly, his language foundation was still too poor. But he was not the kind of person who would shrink back when faced with difficulties. On the contrary, he became even more determined.
    "You can't catch tiger cubs without entering the tiger's lair," he decided to personally attend classes to study teaching methods. It was June weather, and the hot southern sun baked the entire building like a steamer. After Comrade Chen Shufu asked the teachers about the words and characters he did not understand, he sat at his desk, sweating profusely, preparing teaching plans. Often from noon until seven o'clock in the evening, he would get up and walk to the classroom.
    After such a period of painstaking study, Chen Shufu had initially grasped some of the laws of language teaching. He felt that he was quite confident in doing a good job of teaching demonstration.
    At that time, the key problem in language teaching was that the foundations of characters, words, and sentences were not solid, and the phenomenon of repetition was very serious, which caused great distress to both teachers and students. Through listening to lectures, studying homework, and organizing trial lessons, Comrade Chen Shufu found that the main reason was that the teachers' teaching plans were not related to the actual situation of the students, and the explanations were not easy to understand and accept. So Comrade Chen Shufu spent two days preparing a demonstration lecture.
    On the day he gave the lecture, all the language teachers of the regiment came to observe and learn. Comrade Chen Shufu began to lecture confidently and calmly using the language familiar to the soldiers. When he talked about the most difficult to distinguish similar, similar-shaped, and homophonic new characters, he pointed to some characters written on the blackboard and said: "Pay attention, let's line up – this is the '办' (bàn) of 办公 (bàngōng, office), this is the '辨' (biàn) of 辨别 (biànbié, distinguish), this is the '瓣' (bàn) of 花瓣 (huābàn, petal), this is the '辩' (biàn) of 辩论 (biànlùn, debate), and this, is the '辫' (biàn) for the braid on a girl's head!" The soldiers found it interesting and easy to understand, and were really happy. They originally recognized these characters, but they had never been lined up together, and they were always mixed up. Today, after being "lined up" by Political Commissar Chen, they were clearly distinguished. When he talked about the sentence "手足无措" (shǒuzúwúcuò, at a loss what to do), Comrade Chen Shufu suddenly stopped and asked a soldier to stand up and answer. The soldier panicked all of a sudden, and his face turned red and he couldn't answer. Comrade Chen Shufu said with a smile: "Comrades, this is called 手足无措!" The classroom burst into a good-natured roar of laughter. It seemed that these words and sentences were not so difficult to understand, and after Political Commissar Chen pointed them out, they were all descriptions of things that happened in ordinary life! As soon as the class was over, the soldiers happily shouted: "Now the door is open in my heart." The teachers also repeatedly praised: "Our political commissar is really able to delve into things."
    In this way, the difficulty of language teaching was broken down little by little, and the number of people falling behind decreased day by day.
    The troublesome "thirty percent" is gone forever.

    "Confidence is the Most Important"
    Once, Comrade Chen Shufu heard that a soldier was going to be held back a grade. He ran over and saw the soldier working on an arithmetic problem, calculating horizontally and vertically but unable to figure it out, sweating profusely. Comrade Chen Shufu squatted down and said, "Come, let's calculate together and see if it works." He first gave an example, then made a metaphor, and then calculated step by step, and soon, he figured it out. Looking at the soldier who had changed from shy to happy, Comrade Chen Shufu said with a smile: "How is it, do you have confidence this time? Confidence is the most important thing, with confidence you can overcome difficulties. I used to only know simple addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, but now I have learned junior high school algebra." The soldier looked at him in surprise, and he continued: "However, fighting requires tactics, training soldiers requires finding key points, and learning arithmetic also requires knowing the trick." The soldier looked at his political commissar with admiration, nodding his head, and had already decided not to fall behind. At this time, the study group leader standing next to him interjected and said: "Political Commissar, if we have your help like this, no one will fall behind." "Yes," Comrade Chen Shufu then turned the topic to the problem that some people always emphasize that our soldiers are "stupid," which quite affected the soldiers' confidence in learning. He looked affectionately at the soldiers around him and said: "Do you think you are stupid? Just say that on the battlefield, we can detour and encircle, divide and intersperse, and annihilate the enemy in a flexible and flexible way according to various situations. It seems that our soldiers are smart. Since we are smart to deal with living enemies on the battlefield, are we "stupid" to deal with dead textbooks on the cultural front?" None of the soldiers spoke, they all stared at him with wide eyes, only to see him continue to say: "So, the problem must not be raised to smart and stupid, but to see if we are willing to work hard and whether we have found the key to learning." The soldiers all jumped up: "Political Commissar Chen understands and trusts us so much!"

    Embarking on a New Front
    This May, it is the harvest season for cultural learning.
    The cultural general examination began. Comrade Chen Shufu's leadership and the efforts of all the officers and soldiers of the regiment have yielded fruitful results. The Tashan Hero Regiment won first place in the army in the cultural examination. The total average score for language was 96.33, and the total average score for arithmetic was 95.84. One hundred percent of the battalions and companies have reached the excellent standard for unit performance, and 74 percent of the cadres and soldiers have reached the excellent standard for individual performance. Before learning culture, 74 percent of the regiment were illiterate or semi-literate, and now 96 percent of the cadres and soldiers have reached the level of senior primary school graduation or senior primary school level. The Tashan Hero Regiment has conquered the "culture" mountain that blocked their progress and maintained its honor.
    Now a new task is placed in front of the Tashan Hero Regiment. Comrade Chen Shufu bravely accepted it. He once convened political work cadres above the company level to speak, and he pointed out: political work cadres must study military affairs. He said: "Comrades, we are now 'in front of new things' again, we must continue to work hard, always maintain our honor, and must not fall behind the situation!" Then, he went deep into the battalions and companies to study and master the laws of doing a good job in the normal training of troops. He strives to always stand at the forefront of new things!

    他永远站在新事物的前面
    金凤
    苦恼的“百分之三十”
    文化学习开始了。
    塔山英雄团政治委员陈树福同志从来没有这样苦恼过。在他的面前，是一份团文教办公室送来的报告：语文课本教学开始的一个阶段中，掉队的人有百分之三十。
    “百分之三十”！这个数字好像警钟一样使他感到不安。
    他很明白部队迫切需要提高文化的状况。眼前浮现出三连副指导员李延令的影子。这个塔山老战士，在解放战争中打仗像猛虎，全国胜利后却由于缺乏文化而耽心挑不起现代化国防军连队工作的担子。他想起一九五一年军事训练中，九连连长张寿原读射击原理有困难，上不了课的苦恼。……部队向正规化、现代化迈进，却被“文化”这座大山挡住了。要夺取这个山头，他明白这是全军的要求，是全国人民的希望。现在，党把这一团的任务交给他，全团数千战士期望着他，他却拿不出办法——百分之三十的掉队！还是“塔山英雄团”！部队的荣誉在那里呢？难道这个在塔山阻击战中消灭敌人一万多名、打退敌人陆、海、空军十一天的连续进攻，使敌人不能前进一步的英雄部队，今天在文化战线上就不能前进吗？想到这里，陈树福同志更加不安起来，他必须对党的任务、对部队的荣誉负责。但是，他自己也有困难哪！他，只读了三年半书的他，对文化教育确实是“一门不摸”，实在是“外行”啊！
    现在，毛主席的话在他耳边响了起来：“我们熟悉的东西有些快要闲起来了，我们不熟悉的东西正在强迫我们去做。……我们必须克服困难，我们必须学会自己不懂的东西。”
    先当学生，再当先生
    是的，必须学会自己不懂的东西，必须钻进去！
    正在这时候，中南军区政治部副主任到他们部队来检查工作。副主任关心地问起陈树福同志：
    “你现在什么文化水平？”陈树福同志想了一想回答说：“大概是高小程度吧。”于是副主任就随手拿起一本高小语文课本，指着几处词句要他讲解，结果他却讲得不完全。
    这一来，陈树福同志对横在自己面前的困难看得更清楚了，自己的语文基础还太差。但他不是那种看到困难就退缩的人。相反，他倒因此更加下了决心。
    “不入虎穴，焉得虎子”，他决定亲自上课，来钻研教学业务。正是六月天气，南方的火热的太阳烤得整个楼房像蒸笼。陈树福同志在向教员请教了他所不懂的词和字以后，就汗流夹背地坐在桌前准备教案。常常从中午起，直到晚上七点钟，他才站起身来，走向教室。
    经过这样一个苦心钻研的阶段以后，陈树福已经初步领会了语文教学的一些规律。他觉得作好教学示范工作已有相当把握了。
    当时语文教学中关键的问题是：字、词、句的基础不巩固，回生的现象很严重，教员和学员为此都很苦恼。陈树福同志通过听课、研究作业、组织试教，发现主要原因是教员的教案不联系学员的实际，讲解很不通俗，不易为学员所接受。于是陈树福同志花了两天的时间，准备了教学示范的讲课。
    到他上课的那天，全团的语文教员都来观摩学习。陈树福同志开始有把握地、镇定地用着战士所熟悉的语言来讲课了。当他讲到最不易区分的同类、同形、同音的生字时，他指着黑板上写下的一些字说道：“注意，我们来排排队吧——这是办公的‘办’，这是辨别的‘辨’，这是花瓣的‘瓣’，这是辩论的‘辩’，而这个，是小姑娘头上梳辫子的‘辫’字啊！”战士们觉得又有趣又好懂，心里真是高兴。这些字原来都认识，就是没有在一起排过队，老是搅混不清，今天被陈政委一“排队”，就被清清楚楚分辨出来了。讲到“手足无措”这一句，陈树福同志突然停住了，叫一个战士起来回答。那战士一下子慌乱了，红着脸答不上来。陈树福同志笑着说：“同志们，这就叫做手足无措啊！”教室里爆发了一阵善意的轰笑。看起来，这些字句并不是那么难解，经陈政委一点破，原来都是形容平常生活中发生的事的！一下课，战士们都高高兴兴嚷起来：“这下心里开了门”。教员们也都连连称道：“咱们的政委真是能钻。”
    就这样，语文教学的难关一点点被他打破，掉队的一天天减少。
    苦恼的“百分之三十”从此一去不复返了。
    “信心是最重要的”
    一次，陈树福同志听说一个战士要留级了。他跑了去，看到那个战士正在演算一个算术题，横算竖算算不出来，蹩得一头大汗。陈树福同志蹲下来说，“来，咱俩个来算算看行不行。”他先举个例子，再打个比喻，然后一步一步往下算，不一回，算通了。看着这个由羞怯变得高兴了的战士，陈树福同志笑着说：“怎么样，这回有信心了吧？信心是最重要的，有信心就能战胜困难。我原来只会简单的加、减、乘、除，现在学到初中代数了。”战士惊讶地望着他，他继续说：“不过，打仗要讲战术，练兵要找要领，学算术也要看门道啊。”这个战士用敬佩的眼光看着自己的政委，一面点头，一面早已决心不再掉队了。这时，站在旁边的学习小组长插上一句说：“政委，我们要有你这样帮助，大家谁也不会掉队的”。“是呀”，陈树福同志接着又把话题转到一些人总强调我们战士“笨”的问题上，它相当影响了战士们学习的信心。他的眼光爱抚地看着围着他的战士们说：“你们说你们笨吗？就说咱们在战场上，会迂回包围、分割穿插，会根据各种情况机智灵活地歼灭敌人。这样看起来我们战士们是聪明的吧。既然在战场上对付活的敌人我们是聪明的，难道在文化战线上对付死的课本就“笨”起来了吗？”战士们没有一个说话，都睁大着眼睛瞅着他，只见他继续说：“所以，问题决不能提到聪明和笨，而是看咱们是不是肯下苦功夫，是不是摸到学习的门道。”战士们都跳起来了：“陈政委多么了解和信任我们啊！”
    走上新的战线
    今年五月，文化学习上的丰收季节。
    文化大会考开始了。陈树福同志的领导和全团指战员的努力结出了丰盛的果实。塔山英雄团的文化考试成绩荣获全军第一。全团语文总平均九六点三三分，算术总平均九五点八四分。百分之百的营和连都达到单位成绩优良标准，百分之七十四的干部和战士达到个人成绩优良标准。学文化以前，全团文盲、半文盲有百分之七十四，现在有百分之九十六的干部和战士达到高小毕业和高小程度。塔山英雄团攻克了阻碍他们前进的“文化”大山，保持了自己的荣誉。
    现在新的任务又摆在塔山英雄团的面前。陈树福同志勇敢地接受了它。他曾召集连以上政治工作干部讲话，他指出：政治工作干部必须学习军事。他说：“同志们，我们现在又是‘在新事物面前’，我们必须继续努力，永远保持我们的荣誉，千万不能落在形势后面！”接着，他又深入营、连，研究和掌握作好部队正常训练的规律。他争取永远站在新事物的前面！
