    With Government Assistance, People of the Miao Nationality Autonomous Region of Damao Mountain in Guangxi Develop Education

    Lang Chao from the People's Government of the Miao Nationality Autonomous Region of Damao Mountain, Guangxi Province, writes: The Miao Nationality Autonomous Region of Damao Mountain is located in northern Guangxi Province, bordering Guizhou Province. It is inhabited by Miao, Yao, Dong, and Zhuang ethnic groups. Under the long-term policy of obscurantism pursued by the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past, this area's culture was very backward, and most villages did not have a single school.

    After liberation, with the vigorous assistance of the People's Government, the education of ethnic minorities in the region has greatly developed. There are now 191 primary schools in the entire region, with more than 14,000 students; among them, 180 are primary schools specifically or partially for ethnic minorities, with more than 8,000 students from the Miao, Yao, Dong, and Zhuang ethnic groups. In addition, there are two short-term teacher training courses.

    This year, the Guangxi Provincial People's Government has allocated more than 500 million yuan in educational subsidies for ethnic minorities in Damao Mountain to help people of all ethnic groups build school buildings, add teaching equipment, and solve some of the living difficulties of teachers and students. The Guangxi Provincial People's Government Education Department, the Provincial Ethnic Affairs Commission, the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region Culture and Education Bureau, and the Yishan Special District Culture and Education Section have also sent special personnel to Damao Mountain to assist in holding cultural and educational meetings and to properly study the use of this subsidy. People of all ethnic groups are very grateful to the People's Government for its strong assistance in building schools and developing cultural and educational undertakings; many people voluntarily participated in labor and contributed materials during the construction of the schools. At present, the five central schools and two village schools that are being built as key projects in the region have all started construction one after another, and will all be completed before the end of this year; the other 172 primary schools have also added a lot of equipment.

    广西大苗山苗族自治区人民在政府帮助下发展教育事业
    广西省大苗山苗族自治区人民政府浪潮来信：大苗山苗族自治区处在广西省北部和贵州省毗邻的地方，这里住着苗、瑶、侗、僮四个民族。在过去国民党反动派长期的愚民政策统治下，这个地区文化很落后，大部分乡没有一所学校。
    解放后，在人民政府大力扶助下，该区少数民族教育事业有了很大的发展。全区现在已有小学一百九十一所，学生一万四千余人；其中民族专设与民族兼收的小学有一百八十所，苗、瑶、侗、僮族的学生共有八千余人。此外，还有二个短期师资训练班。
    今年广西省人民政府又拨给大苗山少数民族教育补助费五亿余元，以帮助各族人民兴建校舍、增添教学设备并解决教员和学生的某些生活困难。广西省人民政府教育厅、省民族事务委员会、桂西僮族自治区文教局、宜山专署文教科等还都派专人到大苗山协助开好文教会议，妥善研究使用这笔补助费的问题。各族人民对人民政府大力帮助他们修建学校、发展文化教育事业都表示十分感激；不少人在学校兴建时还自动参加劳动和拿出工料。目前该区重点修建的五所中心学校和两所乡校都已先后动工，今年年底前可全部完工；其他还有一百七十二所小学也都添置了不少设备。
