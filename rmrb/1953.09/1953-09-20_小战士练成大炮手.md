Little Soldier Trains to Become a Big Gunner
Wang Renyong Lian Yunshan

"Wait a moment, someone has already gone to find him, he will be here soon, let him talk to you in detail." Comrade Zhang Haiyang, the company commander of the 8th Company of a certain regiment, said this after briefly introducing the situation of the 8th Company's big gunner, Zhang Youzhong. It seems he really likes this soldier.

At this moment, we heard a loud report from outside, and a young soldier strode in. He stood at attention with a "click," looked at the company commander, and said, "Company Commander, soldier Zhang Youzhong of the Third Squad, is here on command." This soldier was not tall, his eyes were bright and spirited, and his face was covered with a layer of down. It seemed he was at most twenty years old.

"Please sit down!" After the company commander gave permission, he sat down and began to talk to us about his learning of artillery.

Just three months ago, Zhang Youzhong had never even seen this kind of new artillery that he is now able to operate. But a few days ago, when the battalion commander personally came to the artillery range to conduct a separate test on Zhang Youzhong, he saw him act like a little tiger, first stepping back to act as squad leader, giving operating commands, and then kneeling on the artillery as a gunner, operating all parts of the artillery. He quickly and deftly completed all the operations from the first gunner, second gunner, all the way to the eighth gunner, and everything was in accordance with the rules. So the battalion commander immediately requested a commendation for Zhang Youzhong from the regiment, and soon the story of Zhang Youzhong learning artillery appeared in the unit's small newspaper. The division immediately issued a circular of commendation for him, and the story of this little soldier quickly becoming a big gunner spread throughout the companies.

As soon as Zhang Youzhong joined the army, he fell in love with anti-aircraft guns at first sight. He touched the green gun body and thought to himself, "It would be great if I could become a qualified gunner!" But because he was young and not strong, the work assigned to him by the superiors was first as a caretaker, and then as a communication soldier. However, the matter of learning artillery was never put down in his heart. His hard work in studying culture was also for the purpose of becoming a good gunner in the future.

In January of this year, his wish came true, and he was assigned to the 8th Artillery Company to learn artillery. When he touched the cannon, which was even thicker than the anti-aircraft gun, he was so happy that he almost jumped up.

Before Zhang Youzhong was transferred to the 8th Company, he had heard that the 8th Company was a heroic company with a glorious history. On the first day he was transferred to the 8th Company, he went to the club during the recreational activities. As soon as he entered, he saw more than ten award banners hanging on the wall, such as "Invincible" and "Exemplary in City Assault," and a silver shield with the inscription of Commander Gao Gang of the Northeast Military Region.

Before formally learning artillery, he also participated in the 8th Company's award ceremony. Director Li of the regiment reported at the meeting, "Because the 8th Company has achieved outstanding results in cultural studies, the superiors have specially approved the 8th Company for a collective merit of first class, and I represent the division leaders in awarding this big red banner to the 8th Company." After the meeting, he took a photo with the old comrades of the 8th Company. When taking the photo, he felt very uncomfortable. While sitting, he thought to himself, "I must also perform meritorious service in the future! I must not tarnish the glorious banner of the 8th Company!"

In the 8th Company, the class love of the comrades warmed him, and the honor of the 8th Company encouraged him. On the first day of learning artillery, he stood on the gun pad with a sweet feeling in his heart. There were such complicated wheels on the gun, and some large and small mirrors and many circles engraved with fine lines. What kind of furniture were these! He had to raise his toes to see the sights. He went to move the iron thing called the spade, but he couldn't move it. He made a strong effort - but still couldn't move it. He thought to himself: This is bad! I've been wanting to be an artilleryman every day, but now that I am one, I'm not tall enough to see the sights, and I'm not strong enough to move the spade. Don't let the superiors transfer me away again, I have to study hard!

However, the difficulties were not just being short and not strong. As soon as he heard the artillery lessons, he felt even more difficult. What ratio method, topography, what mechanical physics, gas pressure, he couldn't understand a lot of it. At this time, squad leader Yu Xueyi encouraged him, "It doesn't matter, you have already studied culture, you should apply it, listen carefully, remember carefully, think carefully, as long as you are determined, you will definitely learn it. If you are not strong, you can practice your body well." Then the company sent Deputy Platoon Leader Zhang Fengjing to serve as extracurricular tutor. Zhang Fengjing patiently tutored the new gunners, and also patiently tutored Zhang Youzhong. In particular, when teaching Zhang Youzhong, the first gunner, how to use the instrument to calculate, he spent a full sixteen hours, patiently teaching him from aiming, calibration, to every mil line. He would patiently teach him as long as Zhang Youzhong was willing to learn, without any impatience.

Zhang Youzhong's confidence in learning artillery increased. He listened attentively in class, took notes, and asked boldly about things he didn't understand, remembering them in his heart and in his notebook. On the training ground, he studied diligently and practiced hard. He also paid attention to the movements of other gunners, over and over again; even when he walked on the road, he paid attention to other gunners talking about their movements. Every night he had to repeatedly look at his notes until he had understood and remembered everything before going to sleep. In this way, he deeply realized that without a certain level of education, one could not master modern military technology.

In order to exercise his body, he practiced parallel bars, vaulting horse, and weightlifting every day during game time, and his body became stronger and stronger. His weightlifting had increased from more than fifty pounds to more than ninety pounds, and the spade that he couldn't move before was now easily lifted away.

After the conversation, Zhang Youzhong asked if he could go back. At this time, the cultural instructor was already standing behind him and said, "Please allow him to go back! We are now rehearsing a song and dance drama, the content of which is a glorious page in the history of the 8th Company: how the 8th Company won the banner of 'Invincible' in the Battle of Jinzhou. Comrade Zhang Youzhong plays a role in this drama."

After getting permission, Zhang Youzhong turned around and walked out of the company headquarters with a "click, click, click." Company Commander Zhang Haiyang looked at his back, so happy that he couldn't close his mouth, his eyes staring at me as if to say, "This is not a small soldier, but a skilled big gunner!"

    小战士练成大炮手
    王壬庸  连云山
    “呆一会，已经去找了，他马上就会来的，让他给你们细细谈吧。”某团八连连长张海洋同志，给我们简单介绍了一下该连大炮手张有忠的情况后，这样说。看样子他真喜欢这个战士。
    这时，只听见外面很宏亮地喊了一声报告，一个年青的战士跨了进来，他“卡”地一个立正，注视着连长说：“连长同志，三班战士张有忠，奉命来了。”这个战士个儿不高，眼睛闪闪有神，脸上还盖着一层汗毛，看来至多也不过二十岁。
    “请坐吧！”连长允许以后，他才坐下来，向我们谈起他学炮的事情来。
    还在三个月以前，像张有忠同志现在能够操纵的这样新式的大炮，他连见都没见过。而前些日子，当营长亲自来到炮场对张有忠进行单独测验时，只见他好似小老虎似地先退后去当班长，下达操作命令，又跪到炮上当炮手，操纵大炮的各部位，从一炮手、二炮手，一直到八炮手的全部操作，都迅速敏捷地完成了，并且完全合乎规则。于是营长马上就为张有忠向团里请了功，很快张有忠学炮的事迹，在部队的小报上出现了。师里并立即通报表扬了他，这个小战士迅速学成了大炮手的事迹也就在各连队里传开了。
    张有忠刚一入伍，一看见高射炮，就爱上了它。他摸着那绿油油的炮身心里想：“我要能当上个够格的炮手，那才带劲哩！”可是因为他年纪轻，力气小，上级分配给他的工作，开始是看护员，以后是通讯员，不过，学炮的事，他从来都没有从心里放下过。他的埋头学文化，也是为了将来当个好炮手。
    今年一月间，愿望实现了，他被分配到炮兵八连去学炮。当他摸着那比高射炮的炮身还要粗壮的大炮时，他简直高兴得要跳起来。
    张有忠没调到八连去以前，他就听说第八连是个有着光荣历史的英雄连队。他被调到八连去的第一天，在文娱活动时间，他到俱乐部去玩，一进门他就望见墙上挂着“无坚不摧”“攻城范例”等十多面奖旗，桌子上还摆着东北军区高岗司令员亲笔题字的一个银盾。
    正式学炮以前，他又参加了八连的受奖大会，团的李主任在会上报告说“因为八连在文化学习中成绩卓著，上级特批准给八连集体记大功一次，我并代表师首长把这面大红锦旗奖给八连”。会后他和八连的老同志一齐照了像。照像时，他觉得自己很不自在，他一面坐着，一面心里想：“今后我也得立功啊！可不能沾污了八连这面光荣的旗帜！”
    在八连，同志们的阶级友爱温暖着他，八连的荣誉又鼓舞着他。开始学炮的那一天，他满心里甜吱吱的往炮垫上一站，炮上有那样复杂的轮子，又有些大大小小的镜子和许多刻着细线的圈圈，那都是些什么家具啊！他把两脚尖翘起来，才能够上看瞄准镜。他去搬那个叫做驻锄板的铁东西，搬不动，猛作劲——也搬不动。他心里想：坏啦！天天想当炮兵，现在当上了，可是个儿不高看不着瞄准镜，力气不大搬不动驻锄板，可不要叫上级又调走我，我得好好学呀！
    可是，困难还不仅仅是个不高，力不大。一听学炮的课程，他更感到困难了。什么比例法，地形学，什么机械物理、瓦斯压力，很多听都听不懂。就在这时，班长于学一鼓励他了，“不要紧，你已经学了文化，应该应用，多用心听，用心记，用心想，只要有决心，一定能学会，力气小嘛，可以好好练身体。”接着连里又派了副排长张凤经同志担任课外辅导。张凤经耐心地辅导着新炮手们，也耐心地辅导着张有忠，特别是教张有忠一炮手使用仪器计算时，整化了十六个小时，从瞄准，标定，直到每根米位刻线，都耐心地教给他，只要张有忠愿意学到什么时候，他就耐心地教到什么时候，毫不厌烦。
    张有忠学炮的信心提高了。在课堂上专心一意地听讲，记笔记，不懂的地方就大胆地问，记在心里，又记在本子上。在操场，他专心学，用功练，别的炮手的动作，他也留心看，一遍又一遍；甚至走到路上，别的炮手谈论自己的动作时，他也留心听。每天晚上他都要反复看笔记，直到全部想通了，记住了，才去睡觉。这样，他才深刻地体会到，没有一定文化就不能掌握现代化的军事技术。
    为了锻炼身体，他在游戏时间就天天练杠子，跳木马，举重，他的身体也越练越结实。举重已从五十多斤，增加到九十多斤，先前搬不动的那个驻锄板现在轻轻一提就提走了。
    谈完以后，张有忠问他可以回去了吗？这时文化教员早站在背后说：“请允许他回去吧！我们现在正在排练一个歌舞剧，内容是八连历史上光荣的一页：锦州之战中，八连是怎样获得‘无坚不摧’这面锦旗的。张有忠同志在这个剧里担任着一个角色呢。”
    得到准许以后，张有忠一个向后转“卡、卡、卡”地走出连部。连长张海洋同志看着他的背影，高兴得嘴都合不住，两眼直瞅着我好像是说：“这不是一个小战士，而是一个熟练的大炮手了！”
