    [From Our Own Correspondent] Beijing—The Industrial Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions jointly convened a city-wide meeting of cadres and labor models from factories and mines on September 24. At the meeting, Liu Ren, Deputy Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPC, delivered a report on the campaign for increased production and savings in Beijing. Deputy Mayor Wu Han, on behalf of the North China Administrative Committee, presented awards to units and individuals from Beijing who were selected as industrial labor models for the North China region in 1952.

    Liu Ren focused his report on the issue of launching the campaign for increased production and savings in industrial and mining enterprises. He first pointed out: The ongoing campaign for increased production and savings in various factories and mines throughout the city not only plays a significant role in completing and overfulfilling this year's national plan but will also greatly promote the production management work of various factories and mines.

    Regarding the city's plan for increased production and savings, he said: After research, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPC and the Beijing Municipal People's Government have initially drafted a plan that, in addition to completing various state plans, industrial and mining enterprises and financial and economic departments throughout the city will increase revenue for the state by 1.2 trillion yuan. Each industrial and mining enterprise should formulate appropriate plans based on objective conditions and subjective strengths as a goal to mobilize the masses to strive for. He pointed out that when formulating plans, it is necessary to oppose both conservative and rash tendencies. On the one hand, the plan should not be too low but should be achievable through effort. Only in this way can we encourage everyone to actively think of ways to improve production and work, thereby raising our leadership, professional, and technical levels. At the same time, the plan should not be too high, not something that cannot be achieved even with effort, otherwise, it will dampen the enthusiasm of cadres and workers and even lead to deviations where unscrupulous means are used and policies are disregarded in order to complete the plan. The preliminary plan formulated by the leadership must be fully discussed by the masses, and a concrete implementation plan must be formulated.

    Liu Ren then pointed out that because the completion of plans by various industrial and mining enterprises in the first half of the year was extremely uneven, the requirements for each unit in the increased production and savings campaign would also be different. Units that performed poorly in completing the plan in the first half of the year should make the greatest effort in the campaign and adopt all means to ensure the completion and strive to overfulfill the state-stipulated plan. Units that have already completed or overfulfilled the state plan in the first half of the year should generally formulate an increased production plan after approval from the competent department. For individual units with difficulties in raw materials or sales, the focus should be on improving quality and reducing costs.

    In the campaign, we must actively seek ways to improve production, establish the concept of comprehensively fulfilling the state plan, and prevent tendencies that neglect quality, neglect costs, neglect safety, and simply increase labor intensity. Moreover, we should not only focus on completing the current task and neglect long-term production plans and necessary reserves, which would cause a "spring shortage" in the second year's production.

    Liu Ren particularly emphasized the need to learn and promote advanced Soviet experiences, requiring that all industrial and mining enterprises where Soviet experts have made suggestions should mobilize the masses to resolutely implement the suggestions of Soviet experts.

    Liu Ren encouraged the labor models to carry forward their glorious traditions and further发挥play their role in this increased production and savings campaign. At the same time, he called on all industrial and mining enterprises to better cultivate and educate labor models, help them formulate concrete plans, and promote the realization of these plans; pay attention to further discovering and cultivating model figures emerging in the competition, and conscientiously summarize their advanced experiences.

    Finally, Liu Ren emphatically explained the great significance of ensuring the completion and striving to overfulfill the first annual plan of the first Five-Year Plan, calling on all employees in the city to further发挥play their high level of enthusiasm and creativity and successfully complete this glorious task.

    Deputy Mayor Wu Han presented awards on behalf of the North China Administrative Committee. He warmly congratulated the Beijing employees on their brilliant achievements in last year's patriotic increased production and savings movement. He said: Beijing employees and the vast number of employees in the North China region together overfulfilled the increased production and savings plan in 1952, accumulating a total of seven trillion yuan of wealth for the country. A large number of model units and model individuals emerged in that movement. Then, he introduced one by one the model deeds of the two workshops, five groups, and sixteen individuals from Beijing who were awarded the honorary title of industrial labor model of the North China region. Amid thunderous applause, representatives of each labor model and model unit walked onto the stage to receive their awards. Labor model representative Li Kezuo, chief engineer of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, and Liu Shimei, a worker from the Qinghe Woolen Mill, spoke successively, both expressing their determination to respond to the honor given to them by the Party and the government with practical actions by actively participating in this increased production and savings campaign.

    北京市召开各企业干部、劳动模范大会
    动员增产节约一万二千亿
    被选为华北区的模范单位和个人在会上受奖
    【本报讯】中共北京市委工业部和北京市总工会，在九月二十四日联合召开了全市厂矿企业干部、劳动模范大会。会上，中共北京市委副书记刘仁就北京市增产节约竞赛的问题做了报告，吴晗副市长代表华北行政委员会向被选为华北区一九五二年工业劳动模范的北京市各单位和个人颁发奖品。
    刘仁着重报告了关于在工矿企业中开展增产节约竞赛的问题。他首先指出：目前全市各工矿企业正在开展的增产节约竞赛，不但对于完成和超额完成今年的国家计划具有极大的作用，而且对于各工矿企业的生产管理工作，也将有巨大的推动作用。
    关于全市增产节约的计划，他说：中共北京市委和北京市人民政府经过研究后，已初步拟定，全市工矿企业和财经部门除完成各项国家计划外，将为国家增加收入一万二千亿元。各工矿企业应根据客观条件和主观力量，分别拟定恰当的计划，作为动员群众奋斗的目标。他指出：订计划时必须反对保守倾向与冒进倾向。一方面计划不应过低，而应该是经过努力后才能完成的，这样，才能推动大家积极想办法，改进生产，改进工作，使我们的领导水平、业务水平和技术水平提高一步。同时，计划也不应过高，不应是经过努力也不能完成的，否则就会打击干部和职工的热情，乃至发生为了完成计划而不择手段、不顾政策的偏差。领导方面拟定的初步计划，必须交给群众充分讨论，并订出具体的执行计划。
    刘仁接着指出，由于上半年各工矿企业完成计划的情况极不平衡，在增产节约竞赛中对各单位的要求也就有所不同。上半年完成计划的情况较差的单位，在竞赛中应尽最大的努力，采用一切办法，保证完成并争取超额完成国家规定的计划。上半年已经完成或超额完成国家计划的单位，一般应经过主管部门批准制订增产计划。对个别原料或销路有困难的，应着重提高质量，降低成本。
    在竞赛中，必须从积极方面设法提高生产，树立全面完成国家计划的观念，防止忽视质量、忽视成本、忽视安全和单纯增加劳动强度的偏向。更不应只顾完成目前任务而不顾长远的生产计划和必要的后备力量，致使第二年的生产发生“春荒”。
    刘仁特别强调要学习与推广苏联先进经验，要求凡有苏联专家提出建议的工矿企业，都应该发动群众坚决贯彻执行苏联专家建议。
    刘仁鼓励劳动模范们发扬过去的光荣传统，在这次增产节约竞赛中进一步发挥作用。同时，他要求各工矿企业更好地培养和教育劳动模范，帮助他们制订具体计划，并促成这个计划的实现；注意进一步发现与培养竞赛中涌现出来的模范人物，并认真地总结他们的先进经验。
    最后，刘仁着重说明了保证完成和争取超额完成第一个五年建设计划的头一个年度计划的重大意义，号召全市职工进一步发挥高度的积极性和创造性，胜利地完成这一光荣任务。
    吴晗副市长代表华北行政委员会发奖。他热情地祝贺了北京市职工在去年工业爱国增产节约运动中的光辉成就。他说：北京市职工和华北区广大职工在一起，在一九五二年超额完成了增产节约计划，全区共为国家多积累了七万亿元的财富。那次运动中，涌现了大批的模范单位和模范人物。接着他逐一介绍了北京市获得华北区工业劳动模范光荣称号的两个车间、五个小组和十六个个人的模范事迹。各劳动模范和模范单位的代表在一阵阵雷动的掌声中依次走上讲台，领取了奖品。劳动模范代表、华北农业机械总厂总工程师李克佐和清河制呢厂工人刘世梅先后讲话，都表示要用积极参加这次增产节约竞赛的实际行动来回答党和政府给自己的荣誉。
