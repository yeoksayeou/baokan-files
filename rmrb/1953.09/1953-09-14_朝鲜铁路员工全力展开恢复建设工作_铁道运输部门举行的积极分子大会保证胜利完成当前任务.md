Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang: Korean railway employees under the Ministry of Railways are responding to Marshal Kim Il-sung's call and are fully engaged in resuming construction work.

    Only five days after the armistice agreement was signed, the sound of steam whistles echoed on the two tracks between Pyongyang and Kaesong; in just ten days, passenger cars began running on the main lines. In just half a month, the stations in the democratic capital of Pyongyang and other stations in northern Korea have been completely renovated.

    The rapid restoration of railway facilities is the result of tireless efforts by all employees of the Ministry of Railways in close cooperation with and with the strong assistance of the Chinese People's Volunteers Railway Corps, and the active labor of the people in various regions. All the employees of the Hamhung Railway Administration completely restored the railway destroyed by enemy aircraft thirty minutes before the armistice agreement took effect within two days, ensuring timely transportation. At present, train drivers are carrying out competitions to complete and over fulfill safe driving plans and traction quotas. In the fields and mountains of northern Korea, trains loaded with building materials can be seen from time to time, heading towards the restoration and construction sites.

    On the railway transportation recovery and construction front, Republic heroes and labor heroes are standing at the forefront of the struggle, just as they did during the war.

    During the three-year war, 50 percent of the total length of railways in northern Korea, more than 3,900 bridges, and 390 tunnels were destroyed by enemy aircraft. The Chongchon River Bridge was bombed by enemy aircraft as many as 176 times in 1951 alone. However, the brave Korean "Railway Restoration Team" members and "Youth Shock Brigade" members, braving the rain of bullets and bombs, closely united and helped each other with the warriors of the Chinese People's Volunteers Railway Transportation Force, disregarding the enemy aircraft's indiscriminate bombing, overcoming all difficulties, and bravely and tenaciously carried out repairs, establishing immortal feats in the struggle to ensure the supply to the front. During the three-year anti-aggression war, 36 Republic heroes and labor heroes, including Han Nan-soo, Jeong Do-myung, and Park Chun-wol, and 16,784 award recipients emerged in the railway transportation department. Today, all employees of the departments under the Korean Ministry of Railways, with the strong support of the Soviet Union, China, and various people's democratic countries, are rapidly restoring the country's transportation arteries with great labor enthusiasm.

    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang: The Korean Railway and Transportation Departments held a four-day activist congress starting on the 7th.

    Many meritorious personnel from the Chinese People's Volunteers Railway Transportation Force were also invited to attend the conference.

    The conference heard a report by Nam Hak-ryong, Vice-Minister of Railways. He highly praised the heroic struggle and immortal achievements of all the staff of the Korean Railway and Transportation Departments and the Chinese People's Volunteers Railway Transportation Force in the anti-aggression war. He said: The assistance given to us by the Chinese People's Volunteers Railway Transportation Force is enormous. This assistance is constantly expanding today during our recovery and construction period. We would like to express our warm gratitude to the great Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and Chairman Mao Zedong. He pointed out that the current tasks of the Railway and Transportation Departments are: to restore and construct major railway factories, car inspection sections, stations, auto repair factories, and ship repair factories; in terms of railway freight and passenger transportation, we must overfulfill this year's transportation plan by 173 percent, and at the same time, ensure the completion of freight and passenger transportation by automobiles and ships.

    The conference discussed in groups the methods for completing the basic tasks of the Railway and Transportation Departments. All attendees unanimously expressed their determination to strive for the victorious completion of the restoration tasks. Finally, Vice-Minister Nam Hak-ryong made a summary.

    When the representative of the Chinese People's Volunteers Railway Transportation Force addressed the meeting, he called on the staff of the Chinese and Korean railway transportation departments to further unite closely, work hard, and crush the enemy's conspiracy to undermine peace.

    朝鲜铁路员工全力展开恢复建设工作
    铁道运输部门举行的积极分子大会保证胜利完成当前任务
    据新华社平壤讯：朝鲜铁道省所属全体职工正在响应金日成元帅的号召，全力展开恢复建设工作。
    停战协定签订后，不过五天，就在平壤开城间的两条轨道上响起了汽笛声；不过十天，各主要干线上的客车都开始行驶了。民主首都平壤的车站和朝鲜北部各地的车站，在短短的半个月中，面貌已经焕然一新。
    铁道设施的迅速恢复，是铁道省所属各部门全体职工在中国人民志愿军铁道部队大力帮助及配合下，进行了不倦的努力，和各地人民积极劳动的结果。咸兴铁道管理局所属全体职工，在两天之内就完全恢复了在停战协定生效前三十分钟被敌机炸毁的铁路，保证了定时的输送工作。目前，火车司机们正在展开完成和超额完成安全行走计划和牵引定量的竞赛。朝鲜北部的原野和山地上，不时可以看到满载建筑材料的列车，驰向恢复建设的工地。
    在铁路运输的恢复和建设战线上，共和国英雄和劳动英雄们像在战争期间一样，站在斗争的最前列。
    在三年战争中，朝鲜北部铁路全长的百分之五十，桥梁三千九百多座及隧道三百九十多所都曾遭敌机炸毁。清川江大桥只在一九五一年就遭敌机滥炸一百七十六次之多。但是，英勇的朝鲜“铁路恢复队”队员们、“青年突击队”队员们，冒着枪林弹雨，和中国人民志愿军铁道运输部队勇士们紧密团结和互助，不顾敌机的狂轰滥炸，克服一切困难，英勇顽强地进行抢修，在保证前方供应的输送斗争中，建立了不朽的功勋。在三年的反侵略战争中，铁道运输部门中涌现出了韩南洙、郑道明、朴春月等三十六位共和国英雄和劳动英雄及一万六千七百八十四位受勋者。今天，朝鲜铁道省所属各部门全体职工，正在苏联、中国及各人民民主国家大力支援下，以巨大的劳动热情，迅速恢复着国家的交通动脉。
    据新华社平壤讯：朝鲜铁道、运输部门自七日起举行了为期四天的积极分子大会。
    中国人民志愿军铁道运输部队的许多功臣也应邀参加了大会。
    大会听取了铁道省副相南学龙的报告。他高度赞扬朝鲜铁道、运输部门全体工作人员和中国人民志愿军铁道运输部队在反侵略战争中的英雄斗争和不朽业绩。他说：中国人民志愿军铁道运输部队给予我们的援助是巨大的。这种援助，在今天我们恢复和建设的时期也在不断扩大着。我们要向伟大的中国人民、中国共产党和毛泽东主席致以热烈的感谢。他指出，铁道、运输部门的当前任务是：恢复和建设主要的铁道工厂、检车段、车站、汽车修理工厂和船舶修理工厂；在铁道的货运和客运方面，要超额完成今年度运输计划的百分之一百七十三，同时要保证完成汽车、船舶的货运与客运。
    大会分组讨论了完成铁道、运输部门基本任务的方法。到会者都一致表示决心要为胜利完成恢复任务而奋斗。最后并由南学龙副相作了总结。
    中国人民志愿军铁道运输部队的代表在会上致词时，号召中、朝铁道运输部门工作人员进一步亲密团结，努力工作，粉碎敌人破坏和平的阴谋。
