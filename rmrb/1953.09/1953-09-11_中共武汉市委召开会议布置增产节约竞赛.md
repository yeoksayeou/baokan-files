The Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting of factory and enterprise cadres throughout the city on the 9th to deploy a production increase and thrift campaign. Li Erzhong, First Deputy Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Committee, delivered a mobilization report.

Li Erzhong first analyzed the basic situation of factories and enterprises in Wuhan, pointing out the favorable conditions for carrying out the production increase and thrift campaign. He then put forward requirements based on the different situations of each factory: the state-owned Wuchang Shipyard, the joint state-private Wuchang No. 1 Cotton Mill, and nearly thirty other factories with a good working foundation and normal production, as well as factories such as the packing plant and tea factory, which do not have full-year production tasks but have large production tasks in the autumn and winter seasons, should all strive to guarantee the over-fulfillment of the annual national production plan. Factories with a certain foundation, but whose plan completion in the first half of the year was too poor or whose raw materials are unstable, such as the Fourth Automobile Parts Assembly Factory and Zhenhuan Cotton Mill, should strive to guarantee the completion of the annual production plan. A small number of factories, such as printing and flour factories, must strive to overcome difficulties and strive to complete the annual plan due to insufficient raw materials and difficult sales. He called on all factories and enterprises to not only increase production but also pay attention to gradually improving product quality, reducing costs, and increasing labor productivity, in order to comprehensively complete and over-fulfill the national plan. Li Erzhong also requested that basic construction units carry out a production increase and thrift campaign to ensure project quality, shorten construction periods, and save raw materials.

Li Erzhong requested that all factories and enterprises grasp three key links when carrying out the competition: First, do a good job of ideological mobilization and preparation, and earnestly mobilize the masses of workers to formulate practical and feasible production increase and thrift plans with specific figures and guarantees. Second, the competition must be closely combined with various production reform tasks, and at present, it should be combined with strengthening planning management, implementing operation plans, and establishing and improving the responsibility system as the central work. Third, strengthen the Party's political work in factories and enterprises. The Wuhan Municipal Committee plans to systematically establish a political work system in factories and enterprises before the end of the year. The Party committees of all factories and enterprises should, on the basis of the city-wide selection of model workers and the strengthening of labor discipline education, earnestly educate workers on the production increase and thrift campaign, painstakingly study the key problems in production, and mobilize and lead the masses to launch the competition.

   中共武汉市委召开会议布置增产节约竞赛
   【本报讯】中共武汉市委员会在九日召开了全市工厂企业干部大会，布置增产节约竞赛。武汉市委第一副书记李尔重作了动员报告。
    李尔重首先分析了武汉市工厂企业的基本情况，指出了开展增产节约竞赛的有利条件。他并根据各工厂的不同情况，分别提出了要求：工作基础较好、生产正常的国营武昌造船厂、公私合营武昌第一纱厂等近三十个工厂，以及虽无全年生产任务，但秋冬两季生产任务很大的打包厂、茶厂等工厂，都应当努力保证超额完成全年国家生产计划。有一定的基础，但上半年完成计划太差或原料不固定的工厂如汽车制配第四厂、震寰纱厂等七个工厂，应当努力保证完成全年生产计划。印刷、面粉等少数工厂，因原料不足、销路困难，必须努力设法克服困难，争取完成全年计划。他号召所有工厂企业不仅要增加生产，还要注意逐步提高产品质量，降低成本和提高劳动生产率，以求全面地完成和超额完成国家计划。李尔重同时要求基本建设单位开展增产节约竞赛，保证工程质量，缩短工期和节约原材料。
    李尔重要求各工厂企业在开展竞赛时抓紧三个环节：一、作好思想动员与准备工作，认真发动职工群众订出切实可行、有具体数字和保证办法的增产节约计划；二、竞赛必须和各项生产改革工作密切结合，在目前就应结合着加强计划管理，实行作业计划和建立与健全责任制度等中心工作进行。三、加强党在工厂企业中的政治工作。武汉市委计划在年底前有系统地在工厂企业中建立政治工作制度。各工厂企业的党委则应在全市评选劳动模范、加强劳动纪律教育的基础上，认真向职工进行关于增产节约竞赛的教育，刻苦钻研生产中的关键问题，发动和领导群众展开竞赛。
