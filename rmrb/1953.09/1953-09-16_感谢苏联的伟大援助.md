Thanking the Great Assistance of the Soviet Union

The 26th meeting of the Central People's Government Committee heard Comrade Li Fuchun's "Report on Consultations with the Soviet Government on the Issue of Soviet Assistance to China's Economic Construction." This report explained the process of consultations between our government delegation and the Soviet government, as well as the Soviet government's tremendous assistance to China's economic construction. The results of the Sino-Soviet consultations are of extremely important significance for guaranteeing the development of China's economic construction. As Chairman Mao said in his telegram to Chairman Malenkov on the 15th: "Because the great Soviet government has agreed to provide systematic economic and technical assistance in the construction and reconstruction of 91 new enterprises in China and 50 enterprises that are under construction and reconstruction, the Chinese people will be able to gradually establish their own powerful heavy industry by learning from the advanced experience and the latest technological achievements of the Soviet Union. This will have extremely important implications for China's industrialization, the gradual transition of China to socialism, and the strengthening of the power of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union."

Starting this year, China has entered the period of the first Five-Year Plan. The general goal of the first Five-Year Plan is to first concentrate major efforts on developing heavy industry to establish the foundation for national industrialization and defense modernization. Although building heavy industry requires huge amounts of capital, a long period of time, and relatively complex technology, we must not abandon this policy and choose another. Because to fundamentally improve the people's lives and satisfy their material needs, we must systematically develop the national economy; and to systematically develop the national economy, we must have a strong industry, especially heavy industry. Only by developing the country's heavy industry, namely, hardware, fuel, electricity, machinery, chemicals, and the defense industry, can we develop all light industry, transportation, and modern agriculture, transform China from a backward and poor agricultural country into an advanced, strong, and prosperous industrial country, ensure the consolidation of national defense, and begin to thoroughly improve the lives of all the people, making it possible for the people (most of whom are farmers) to gradually obtain modern living conditions and abundant consumer goods. In contrast, if we focus on developing light industry, agriculture, or other aspects, we will never be able to become an industrial country, and there will be no source for the machines needed by our light industry and agriculture. As a result, we will have neither heavy industry nor light industry; neither industry nor large-scale developed agriculture; neither the development of industry and agriculture nor the real guarantee and improvement of the lives of workers and peasants. In that case, our country and people will be in a state of poverty for a long time, not to mention modern national defense. Therefore, our construction policy should not only take into account the current needs of the people but also the long-term needs of the people. Of course, concentrating major efforts on building the country's heavy industry must correspondingly cultivate national construction talents, develop transportation, light industry, agriculture, and expand commerce. At the same time, we should also promote the cooperativization of agriculture and handicrafts and the transformation of private industry and commerce in a planned way, and correctly bring into play the role of individual agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce. All of these are to ensure the continuous rise of China's economy, to ensure the steady growth of the proportion of socialist components in the national economy, and to ensure the gradual improvement of the people's material and cultural living standards on the basis of developing production. The realization of these tasks will greatly advance our cause of building an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, prosperous, and strong New China.

The task of China's Five-Year Plan is glorious and arduous. To accomplish this task, we must mobilize the people of all strata throughout the country, unite as one, and work hard. In addition, we also need international assistance, first and foremost from the Soviet Union. Chairman Mao, in refuting the erroneous view that China's revolutionary cause "can be victorious without international assistance," pointed out: "In the era of imperialism, the true people's revolution in any country cannot achieve its own victory without the assistance of international revolutionary forces in various ways. It is impossible to consolidate it after victory." (On the People's Democratic Dictatorship) This means that we not only needed assistance in the past, we still need assistance now, and we will need it in the future.

Everything is difficult at the beginning. We thank the Soviet government and the Soviet people for giving us generous, selfless, and enormous support in the most difficult initial stage of our economic construction. According to the results of the consultations between our government delegation and the Soviet government, including the enterprises that have been helped us designed over the past three years, the Soviet Union will assist China in building and renovating 141 large-scale projects by 1959, including iron and steel complexes, non-ferrous metallurgical enterprises, coal and oil enterprises, machine manufacturing plants, automobile and tractor manufacturing plants, hydroelectric and thermal power stations, and so on. After these enterprises are completed, China's industrial production capacity will greatly increase, and China will be a country with its own independent industry, and China's industrialization will have a solid foundation. Obviously, without the assistance of the Soviet Union, we would not be able to implement China's Five-Year Plan on such a large scale, at such a scale, and at such a speed.

On August 4th this year, the leaders of the Soviet Communist Party and government, Comrade Malenkov and others, wrote in their inscription to China's Industrial and Agricultural Exhibition: "We are convinced that the great Chinese people, under the leadership of their glorious Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong and their people's revolutionary government, will achieve new and great victories and will ensure that New China becomes a powerful people's democratic country with developed industry and advanced agriculture in a short historical period. Dear comrades, you can be sure that in the great cause of socialist transformation in People's China, you will always receive the friendly and active support of the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet government." The Soviet leaders' warm wishes and internationalist friendship for the Chinese people are fully manifested in the Soviet Union's large-scale assistance to China's economic construction.

The Soviet Union's assistance to China has always been sincere and selfless. In this consultation between our government delegation and the Soviet government, for all the projects in China that we requested the Soviet Union to assist, as long as they were necessary, conditionally feasible, and we could not do it ourselves, the Soviet government always fully satisfied our requirements; for those that should be done but we did not consider, the Soviet government also actively suggested to us, thus increasing the number of projects. In the enterprises that the Soviet Union helps us build and renovate, from selecting the site, collecting basic design data, determining the design task book, carrying out the design, supplying equipment, guiding construction and installation, and starting operation, to the manufacture of new products and the free supply of technical data for manufacturing new products, the Soviet government gives China generous assistance. In order to cultivate the strength of China's economic construction, the Soviet Union will accept China's dispatch of interns to factories in the Soviet Union for internships and will continue to send experts to work in China. It is truly a historical initiative that the two countries have resolved so many enterprise construction issues and planned such long-term and comprehensive assistance in one negotiation.

It must be pointed out that for China's economic construction work, international assistance is certainly necessary and important, but the fundamental key is to rely on the unity, hard work, and self-reliance of the Chinese people. To realize industrialization in our large country with a backward economy, our people must, of course, have great persistence and overcome countless inevitable difficulties. The mentality of fantasizing about relying entirely on foreign aid and waiting for success is, of course, extremely absurd. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have united as one, worked hard, and relied on their own efforts in the past, and since they have been able to overcome various difficulties and achieve revolutionary victory and the success of the national economic recovery work with international assistance, then today, with the comprehensive and extremely large assistance of the Soviet government to China's economic construction, we ourselves should make our best efforts to ensure the completion of the newly built and renovated enterprises, fully tap the potential of existing enterprises, and strive to increase production and practice economy in all aspects, and make unremitting efforts to accumulate sufficient funds for the country and to realize national industrialization.

Under the great assistance of the Soviet Union, what is the specific goal of the current efforts of the Chinese people?

First of all, it is necessary to take the enterprises that the Soviet Union helps us build and renovate as the backbone and develop China's economic undertakings in a planned way in accordance with the law of proportional development of the national economy. What should be noted here is that construction projects should be distinguished between primary and secondary, grasp the policy of focusing on heavy industry, oppose the practice of average development and dispersing forces; advance steadily in a pragmatic way, oppose the subjective idealism of blind adventurism; learn and master the most basic method in planning work - the method of balance, pay special attention to the relationship and balance between new and old factories, large and small factories, and give full play to the production potential of existing enterprises, and oppose conservative tendencies in production.

Secondly, it is necessary to strengthen basic construction work, especially to strengthen geological exploration work, to ensure that there are sufficient and reliable mineral resources. It is necessary to strengthen design work, strengthen design forces, and master correct design ideas. It is necessary to improve the technical level of construction and installation in construction and cultivate new construction and installation forces. It is necessary to strengthen the leadership of basic construction and continue to transfer strong cadres to the basic construction departments.

Thirdly, it is necessary to adapt to the needs of the Soviet Union's assistance to China and do a good job in all preparations for construction. For example, determining the design task book for enterprises and determining the factory site as soon as possible; providing correct design data (including geological data); quickly reviewing and approving the designs submitted by the Soviet side; actively completing the equipment manufacturing tasks undertaken by China itself; and quickly deploying cadres for various newly built and renovated enterprises and determining the planning issues of important industrial zones and industrial cities, and so on.

Finally, it is necessary to strengthen the study of the Soviet Union and cultivate construction talents. It is necessary to study the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)," political economy, and the experience of the Soviet Union in building socialism; study the advanced technical sciences of the Soviet Union; study all the design documents, construction and installation work, and start-up operation work of the enterprises that the Soviet Union helps us build and renovate; send interns to study in the Soviet Union, and strengthen the technical education of our universities, specialized schools, and secondary technical schools, and so on.

The first year of China's first Five-Year Plan has already begun this year. We thank the Soviet government and the Soviet people for the great assistance they have given us for China's Five-Year Plan. We must mobilize the people of the whole country, especially the entire working class, to participate in this great construction cause, give full play to their greatest strength in their respective posts, overcome difficulties, complete and overfulfill the state's plan, and bravely advance toward the road of national industrialization.

### 感谢苏联的伟大援助

    感谢苏联的伟大援助
    中央人民政府委员会第二十六次会议，听了李富春同志的“关于与苏联政府商谈苏联对我国经济建设援助问题的报告”。这个报告说明了我国政府代表团和苏联政府商谈的经过，以及苏联政府对我国经济建设的巨大援助。中苏两国商谈的结果，对于保证我国经济建设事业的发展有极其重要的意义。正如毛主席十五日致马林科夫主席的电文中所说的：“由于伟大的苏联政府同意在建设和改建中国的九十一个新的企业以及正在建设和改建的五十个企业中给以系统的经济的和技术的援助，中国人民将能够在学习苏联的先进经验和最新技术成就的努力之下，逐步地建立起自己的强大的重工业，这对于中国工业化、使中国逐步地过渡到社会主义和壮大以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的力量，都具有极其重大的作用。”
    从今年开始，我国进入了第一个五年建设计划的时期。第一个五年建设计划的总目标，是首先集中主要力量发展重工业，以建立国家工业化和国防现代化的基础。尽管建设重工业需要巨量资金、较长时间和比较复杂的技术，但我们决不能舍弃这一个方针而选择另外的方针。因为要从根本上改善人民生活，使人民的物质需要得到满足，就必须有系统地发展国民经济；而要有系统地发展国民经济，就必须有强大的工业，特别是要有重工业。只有发展了国家的重工业，即五金、燃料、电力、机械、化学和国防工业等等，才能发展一切轻工业、运输业和现代化的农业，才能把中国从落后的贫困的农业国家变为先进的强大的繁荣的工业国家，才能保证国防的巩固，才能着手彻底地改善全体人民的生活，使人民（其大部分是农民）有可能逐步得到现代化的生活条件，得到富裕的消费品。与此相反，如果将建设重点放在发展轻工业、农业或其它方面，我们就会始终不能成为一个工业国家，而我们的轻工业和农业所需要的机器也就没有来源，结果我们将既没有重工业，也没有轻工业；既没有工业，也没有大规模发展的农业；既没有工农业的发展，也没有工人农民生活的真正保障和真正改善。那样，我们的国家和人民都将长期陷于贫困的境地，更不用说现代化的国防了。因此，我们的建设方针，就应该不仅照顾到人民目前的需要，而且要照顾到人民的长远需要。当然，集中主要力量建设国家的重工业，必须相应地培养国家建设人材，发展交通运输业、轻工业、农业和扩大商业。同时，还应该有步骤地促进农业、手工业的合作化和进行对私营工商业的改造，并正确地发挥个体农业、手工业和私营工商业的作用。所有这些，都是为了保证我国经济不断地上升，为了保证国民经济中社会主义成份比重的稳步增长，为了保证在发展生产的基础上逐步提高人民物质生活和文化生活水平。这些任务的实现，将使我们建设独立民主和平统一富强的新中国的事业，大大向前迈进一步。
    我国五年建设计划的任务是光荣而又艰巨的。为了完成这一任务，我们必须动员全国各阶层人民，团结一致，努力以赴。除此而外，我们还需要国际的援助首先是苏联的援助。毛主席在驳斥那些认为中国革命事业“不要国际援助也可以胜利”的错误观点时曾经指出：“在帝国主义存在的时代，任何国家的真正的人民革命，如果没有国际革命力量在各种不同方式上的援助，要取得自己的胜利是不可能的。胜利了，要巩固，也是不可能的。”（论人民民主专政）这就是说，我们不仅过去需要援助，现在还需要援助，而将来也是这样。
    万事起头难。感谢苏联政府和苏联人民，在我国经济建设的最困难的开始阶段，给了我们慷慨无私的巨大的支援。根据我国政府代表团和苏联政府商谈的结果，连同过去三年来帮助我国设计的企业在内，至一九五九年为止，苏联将援助我国新建和改建一百四十一项规模巨大的工程，其中包括钢铁联合企业，有色冶金企业，煤和石油企业，机器制造厂，汽车和拖拉机制造厂，水力和火力发电站等等。这些企业建成后，我国工业生产能力将大大增长，我国就将是一个自己有独立工业的国家，我国的工业化就将有一个稳固的基础。显然的，如果没有苏联的援助，我们是不可能在这样巨大的范围内，在这样的规模上以这样的速度来实施我国的五年建设计划的。
    今年八月四日，苏联共产党和政府领袖马林科夫同志等九人在写给我国工农业展览会的题词中说：“我们确信，伟大的中国人民，在以毛泽东同志为首的自己的光荣的共产党、自己的人民的革命的政府领导之下，将取得新的伟大的胜利，将在短短的历史时期内，保证新中国成为具有发展的工业和先进的农业的强大的人民民主大国。亲爱的同志们，你们可以确信，在人民中国社会主义改造的伟大事业中，会永远得到苏联各族人民、苏联共产党和苏联政府的友好和积极支援的保证。”苏联的领袖们对于中国人民的这种热烈的愿望和国际主义的友情，在苏联对我国经济建设的大规模援助中完全表现出来了。
    苏联对我国的援助，一贯是诚恳无私的。在这次我国政府代表团和苏联政府的商谈中，所有在我国提请苏联予以援助的项目，只要是必要的、有条件办的、并且单靠我们自己办不到的，苏联政府总是充分地满足我们的要求；凡是应该办而我们没有考虑到的，苏联政府也积极向我国建议，因而增加了项目。在苏联帮助我们新建和改建的企业中，从选择厂址、搜集设计基础资料、确定设计任务书、进行设计、供应设备、指导建筑安装和开工运转，一直到新产品制造以及无偿地供给制造新产品的技术资料等等，苏联政府都给我国以慷慨的援助。为了培养我国经济建设的力量，苏联将接受我国派遣实习生到苏联各工厂进行实习，并继续派遣专家来到我国工作。两个国家在一次的谈判中，解决了这样多的企业建设问题，规划了这样长久的和全面的援助，实在是历史上的创举。
    必须指出：对于我国的经济建设工作，国际的援助固然是必需的和重要的，但是根本的关键，却是依靠我国人民的团结一致，艰苦奋斗，自力更生。要在我们这样一个经济落后的大国中实现工业化，我们全国人民当然要有极大的坚持性，要战胜无数的不可避免的困难。那种幻想一切依赖外援，自己等着坐享其成的心理，当然是极端荒谬的。我国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导之下，过去团结一致，艰苦奋斗，自力更生，既然能够克服种种困难，并在国际援助下取得了革命的胜利和国民经济恢复工作的成功，那末，今天有了苏联政府对我国经济建设的全面的和极其巨大的援助，我们自己就更应该竭尽最大的努力，保证新建和改建企业的完成，充分发挥现有企业的潜力，并从各方面努力增产节约，为国家积累充分的资金，为实现国家工业化而不懈地努力。
    在苏联的伟大援助之下，我国人民当前具体努力的目标是什么呢？
    首先，就是要以苏联帮助我们新建和改建的企业为骨干，按照国民经济按比例发展的法则，来有计划地发展我国的经济事业。这里应该注意的是：各项建设要分别主次，抓住以重工业为主的方针，反对平均发展和分散力量的作法；要实事求是地稳步前进，反对盲目冒进的主观主义；要学习和掌握计划工作中最基本的方法——平衡的方法，特别要注意新厂与旧厂、大厂与小厂的相互关系和平衡，并充分发挥现有企业的生产潜力，反对生产中的保守倾向。
    其次，就是要加强基本建设工作，特别是要加强地质勘探工作，保证有充足的确实的矿产资源。要加强设计工作，壮大设计力量并掌握正确的设计思想。要提高施工中建筑安装的技术水平，生长新的建筑安装力量。要加强基本建设的领导，继续抽调强的干部到基本建设部门中去。
    再次，就是要适应苏联对我国援助的工作需要，作好一切建设的准备工作。例如及早确定企业设计任务书和确定厂址；供给正确的设计资料（包括地质资料）；迅速进行苏方交来的设计的审查批准工作；积极完成我国自己所承担的设备制造任务；以及迅速调配各新建和改建企业的干部并确定重要工业区和工业城市的规划问题等等。
    最后，要加强学习苏联和培养建设人材。要学习“联共（布）党史”、政治经济学和苏联建设社会主义的经验；学习苏联先进的技术科学；学习苏联帮助我国新建和改建企业的全部设计文件、建筑安装工作、开工运转工作；要派遣实习生到苏联留学，加强我国大学、专科学校和中等技术学校的技术教育等等。
    我国第一个五年建设计划的第一年已经从今年开始了。我们感谢苏联政府和苏联人民为了我国五年建设计划给予我们的巨大援助。我们必须动员全国人民首先是全体工人阶级参加这一伟大的建设事业，在各自的岗位上发挥最大的力量，克服困难，完成和超额完成国家的计划，向着国家工业化的道路英勇前进。
