    Strive to Increase Grain Harvests
    Solve Gun Shortages, Eliminate Pests in Large Numbers
    In the mountainous areas of Northwest and Southwest China, wild animals eating livestock and damaging crops is a serious problem. To eliminate pests and protect production, the people's governments of these regions, in addition to mobilizing the masses in mountainous areas to widely organize hunting teams and pest prevention groups, also help the masses solve the difficulties of lacking hunting guns and gunpowder. Xinjiang Province used 4.3 billion yuan in livestock protection loans to purchase more than 2,000 hunting guns and other tools from the mainland, distributing them to hunters of various ethnic groups to kill wolves and eliminate pests. Xuanwei County, Yunnan Province, distributed more than 900 stocked indigenous guns and 1,500 jin of gunpowder to the masses to hunt wild animals. Ping Mountain County, Sichuan Province, issued more than 1,000 muskets and more than 200 jin of gunpowder ingredients to the masses. Zheng'an County, Guizhou Province, allocated 400,000 yuan to help the Miao farmers in Wushui Township, who were hunting animals, and sent four soldiers from the public security forces to assist. Baoxing County, Xikang Province, set up furnaces in the first, fourth, and fifth districts to help hunting teams repair their hunting guns. Some cooperatives also cooperated in purchasing animal hides to help the masses solve difficulties in animal hunting. In this way, a mass animal hunting movement with organization and leadership has been formed in various places. According to statistics from Guangxi, Yunnan, Sichuan, and Hubei provinces alone, from January to the end of July, a total of more than 166,000 harmful birds and animals were captured and killed.
    Mobilize the Masses to Eliminate Insects and Protect the Autumn Harvest
    Recently, rice stem borers have successively occurred in the late rice fields of Nanchang, Yifeng, Gao'an, and other counties in Jiangxi Province. These areas have taken emergency measures to eliminate them. Nanchang County organized more than 190 women and children to capture and kill more than 390 jin of pests, and also adopted methods such as pumping water into the fields, sweeping insects into the water, and spraying 0.5% of 666 powder to kill insects. Yifeng County mobilized more than 200 people to go to the fields to catch insects every day, and the insects were wiped out within four days. In order to prevent the spread of pests, areas currently affected by pests are continuing to eliminate insects by methods such as dripping oil to sweep them down and digging ditches to encircle and fight them.

    Affected by the climate, some rice stem borers have now entered the soil to pupate, and some are turning into moths to lay eggs. It is estimated that insect pests may still occur in the future. Therefore, in areas where rice stem borers are currently harming, in addition to actively capturing them, it is also necessary to check the occurrence of rice stem borers, strive for the initiative, and mobilize the masses to collect eggs in time to prevent the recurrence of insect pests.
    Open Up Fertilizer Sources, Apply More Fertilizer
    In the previous period, Changle County, Fujian, devoted all its efforts to fighting drought, and accumulated very little fertilizer. After the rain last month, although the county people's bank and cooperative departments promptly issued loans and supplied some fertilizers, some areas still felt that there was a shortage of fertilizer. Based on this situation, the Changle County Committee of the Communist Party of China immediately instructed all districts to mobilize farmers to open up fertilizer sources and apply local fertilizer to solve the fertilizer shortage problem. Cadres in various districts and townships actively mobilized the masses to buy human manure in areas along the river with convenient transportation; to increase the accumulation of sea fertilizer and fish fertilizer in coastal areas; and, in conjunction with the patriotic health campaign, to sweep up garbage and fertile soil for fertilizer; in areas with crops such as peanuts, to use peanut branches and leaves as fertilizer. All parts of the county adopted the above methods to widely accumulate and purchase fertilizer, so that most of the late rice fields and sweet potato gardens completed topdressing work. According to statistics, the general amount of fertilizer applied has increased compared with last year. Huayang Township in the third district has a total of 2,112 mu of paddy fields, with an average of 15 dan of fertilizer applied per mu, an increase of 2 dan compared with last year. The general amount of fertilizer applied throughout the county is 15 dan to 17 dan per mu, an increase of about 2 dan compared with last year.
    Build Water Conservancy Projects to Ensure Increased Production
    Most of Yongtai County, Fujian, is mountainous and terraced, and crops are often affected by water and drought disasters, resulting in poor harvests. Last year, there were six floods, and one on April 29 alone inundated more than 9,500 mu of paddy fields in 30 townships. In order to strive for more grain this year, the leaders of the county actively led farmers to build farmland water conservancy projects. From January to the end of August this year, the county repaired more than 6,900 places and built more than 290 new places, and opened 53 reservoirs. The benefited area is more than 160,000 mu, accounting for more than 52% of the total area of ​​paddy fields in the county. The construction of water conservancy projects has greatly reduced water and drought disasters in farmland and ensured increased grain production. This year, only two mountain floods occurred in the county, and the largest one only flooded more than 900 mu of fields, which did not suffer major losses after rescue. Dongpo Township in the third district repaired Yangtou Dike in March. Later, when the drought was severe in the area, the more than 1,000 mu of fields on both sides of the dike still often had one or two inches of water. (Liu Woxin)
    Zhangwu County's Fourth District Organizes the Masses to Participate in the Autumn Harvest
    The crops in the fourth district of Zhangwu County, Heilongjiang Province are in good condition this year, and a bumper harvest is expected. It is estimated that this year's output will exceed last year's average output by 30%. All cadres in the district have now gone to various villages to organize the masses to do a good job in the autumn harvest.

    The fourth district of Zhangwu County has made proper arrangements for the order of harvesting. Farmers in various villages have generally implemented the method of harvesting one piece when it is ripe, so as to prevent the early ripe crops from being blown away by the wind. For example, the millet in Guo Mengqin's field in Damao Village ripened at both ends first, so the mutual aid group started harvesting from both ends of the field. Another example is that the millet in Zhao Yi's field ripened in the middle first, so the mutual aid group decided to harvest the millet in the middle of the field first. Because the mutual aid group solved the problem of which to cut first and which to cut later and the problem of labor organization, and carried out the harvesting meticulously, it is estimated that 40,000 shi (each shi is 500 market catties) of grain can be harvested from 13,000 hectares of land in the whole district. The reduced losses from careful harvesting in the autumn harvest process alone can increase 1,500 shi of grain. However, there are still a few village cadres and farmers who have the paralyzing thought of "not being in a hurry." For example, the autumn harvest instructions issued by the Fourth District Committee of the Communist Party of China in Zhangwu County to various branches on September 2 were received by the village chief (party member) of Baijia Village, who kept them in his pocket until district cadres inspected work on the 10th, when he took out the instructions. In order to correct this phenomenon and successfully complete the autumn harvest work, all district cadres have gone to various villages to specifically supervise and lead the autumn harvest work.
    Give Play to the Enthusiasm of Male and Female Team Members in the Autumn Harvest
    The climate in Buteha Banner, Inner Mongolia, is cool this year, and it freezes early, and the ripening of crops is extremely uneven. The masses have tried to find ways to harvest one piece when it is ripe, so as not to waste grain. The Song Mingxin mutual aid group in the banner has formulated the order of rotation in the autumn harvest according to the specific situation, and implemented the method of small contracting. They stipulate that the early ripe ones should be harvested first, and the late ripe ones should be harvested later. The order of various crops is arranged in the order of first grass fields and then large fields. The terrain is arranged in the order of wind gap, depression, slope, and sunny land. The dense seedlings are harvested first, and the sparse seedlings are harvested later. The harvesting of crops is contracted. Mastering these principles, they appropriately and flexibly allocated manpower according to the actual situation, and also divided the work for women according to the principle of equal pay for equal work. In this way, the enthusiasm of all male and female team members was stimulated, and everyone made full preparations to strive for a fast and clean harvest.

    Overcome Drought and Welcome Another Bumper Harvest
    After overcoming the drought that had not occurred in the local area for 20 years, the farmers in Jiaxing Prefecture, Zhejiang Province, are stepping up preparations for the autumn harvest and autumn planting, and are full of confidence in welcoming another bumper harvest year. Until mid-to-late August, the drought in Jiaxing Prefecture still seriously threatened the growth of autumn crops. The Jiaxing Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China led all cadres to lead the farmers in the whole region to organize and wage a tenacious and sustained struggle against the drought. By the beginning of September, according to statistics from 14 counties including Jiaxing and Pinghu, more than 840,000 mu of water-cut fields and dry white fields had been rescued, making it possible for more than 90% of the late rice fields in the whole region to have a bumper harvest. Jiaxing County alone dredged 287 dried-up rivers and rescued 170,000 mu of crops during the drought. At present, the late rice in the area is heading and flowering, and its growth is generally better than last year. The Jiaxing Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China has instructed all localities to quickly revise and change the original deployment before harvesting, shift the central work to the preparation work for rushing to harvest and plant, protect the autumn and prevent floods, and strive for a bumper agricultural harvest.

    为增加粮食收获量而斗争
    解决猎枪困难，大量消灭害兽
    西北、西南等区的山岳地带，野兽吃食牲畜和糟蹋庄稼的现象很严重。这些地区的人民政府为了消灭兽害，保护生产，除发动山区群众广泛组织打猎队和防兽小组外，并帮助群众解决缺乏猎枪和火药的困难。新疆省以四十三亿元的保畜贷款，在内地购买两千多支猎枪和其他工具，分发给各族猎枪手，打狼除害。云南省宣威县将库存土枪九百余支、火药一千五百斤，分发给群众打野兽。四川省屏山县发给群众火枪一千多枝，火药原料二百多斤。贵州省正安县拨款四十万元，帮助该县乌水乡打兽的苗族农民，并派了公安部队的四个战士去协助。西康省宝兴县在一、四、五区设立了炉子，帮助打猎队修理猎枪。有些地区的合作社并配合收购兽皮，帮助群众解决打兽中的困难。这样，各地便形成有组织有领导的群众性打兽运动。仅广西、云南、四川、湖北四个省自一月到七月底的统计，共捕打害鸟害兽十六万六千多只。
    发动群众，灭虫保秋
    最近江西省南昌、宜丰、高安等县的晚稻田里，先后发生夜盗虫。这些地区都采取了紧急措施，进行扑灭。南昌县组织了妇女、儿童一百九十多人捕捉，消灭害虫三百九十多斤，同时还采用了车水灌田，扫虫落水，喷撒百分之零点五的六六六药粉等方法灭虫。宜丰县每天发动二百余人下田捕虫，四天内把虫捉净。为了防止害虫蔓延扩大，目前发生虫害地区正在用滴油扫落和掘沟围打等办法继续灭虫。
    夜盗虫因受气候影响，目前部分已入土化蛹，有的在变蛾产卵，估计今后虫害可能仍会发生。因此，在夜盗虫正在为害的地区除积极捕捉外，并要检查夜盗虫发生情况，争取主动，及时发动群众采卵，制止虫害复发。
    开辟肥源，多施肥料
    福建长乐县在前一时期由于全力抗旱，积肥很少。上月落雨后，县人民银行和合作社部门虽然都及时地发放贷款和供应了部分肥料，若干地区仍感肥料不足。中共长乐县委根据这一情况，立即指示各区动员农民开辟肥源，施用土肥解决缺肥问题。各区乡干部便积极发动群众，在沿江交通便利地区买人粪；沿海地区增积海肥、鱼肥；结合爱国卫生运动，打扫垃圾、沃土作肥料；有花生等作物地区，采取花生枝叶等作肥料。全县各地采取了上述各种办法广泛积肥购肥，使大部分晚稻田和蕃薯园完成追肥工作。据统计，一般施肥量都比去年增多。三区华阳乡共有稻田二千一百二十亩，平均每亩施肥十五担，比去年增加两担。全县一般施肥量每亩都在十五担至十七担，比去年增加两担左右。
    兴修水利，保证增产
    福建永泰县大部是山地、梯田，农作物因受水旱灾害影响，经常歉收。去年曾发生六次洪水，单四月二十九日一次就淹掉三十个乡的九千五百多亩稻田。该县领导方面为争取今年多收粮食，积极领导农民兴修农田水利。从今年一月到八月底，全县共修补六千九百多处，新修二百九十多处，开蓄水池五十三口。受益田十六万余亩，占全县稻田总面积百分之五十二以上。兴修的水利工程使农田大大地减轻了水旱灾害，保证了粮食增产。今年该县只发生过两次山洪，最大的一次只淹九百多亩田，经抢救后也未受到大的损失。三区东坡乡在三月间修好洋头圳，后来该地旱象严重时，圳两旁一千多亩田仍经常有一、二寸深水。（刘我信）
    彰武县四区组织群众投入秋收
    黑龙江省彰武县第四区今年庄稼良好，可望丰收，估计今年产量将超过去年平均产量百分之三十，全区干部现在已到各村组织群众做好秋收工作。
    彰武县第四区对收割的次序作了妥善的安排，各村农民普遍贯彻了熟一片割一片的办法，以免先熟的庄稼被风吹掉颗粒。如大庙村农民郭孟勤地中的谷子两端先熟，互助组就从地的两头收割起。又如赵义地中的谷子中间先熟，互助组就决定先收割地当中的谷子。由于互助组内解决了先割后割的问题和劳动力组织的问题，并细致地进行收割，全区一万三千垧地估计可收四万石（每石五百市斤）粮食，仅在秋收过程中细收细打减少的损失，就能增加一千五百石粮食。但是还有少数村庄的干部和农民有着“不着忙”的麻痹思想。例如中共彰武县第四区区委在九月二日发到各支部的秋收指示，柏家村村长（党员）接到后，一直就装在口袋里，直到十日区干部检查工作时，他才把指示拿出来。为了纠正这种现象，胜利完成秋收工作，全体区干部已分头深入各村，具体督促和领导秋收工作。
    秋收中发挥男女组员积极性
    内蒙古布特哈旗今年气候凉，上冻早，庄稼成熟的极不一致。群众纷纷想办法，争取熟一块割一块，不糟蹋粮食。该旗宋明新互助组，按照具体情况，规定了秋收中轮作的次序，并实行小包工的办法。他们规定早熟的先割，晚熟的后割，对各种作物的顺序，以先草田后大田的顺序排列，对地势则以风口、洼地、坡地、阳地的顺序排列，对苗密的先割，苗稀的后割。并对庄稼的收割实行包工的办法。掌握了这些原则，他们就按实际情况，适当地、灵活地调配了人力，对妇女也按同工同酬的原则分了工。这样，激发了全组男女组员的积极性，大家都作了充分准备，要争取收的快，收的净。

    战胜旱灾，迎接又一个丰收
    浙江嘉兴专区的农民，战胜了当地二十年来从未有过的旱灾以后，正加紧进行秋收秋种准备工作，满怀信心地迎接又一个丰收年成。嘉兴专区直到八月中、下旬，旱灾还严重威胁着秋禾的生长。中共嘉兴地委领导着全体干部，带动全区农民组织起来，和灾荒进行了顽强的持续的斗争，到九月初，据嘉兴、平湖等十四个县统计，共抢救了断水田、干白田八十四万多亩，使全区百分之九十以上的晚稻田可望丰收。只是嘉兴县，在抗旱期间，就疏通了干涸的河道二百八十七条，抢救了十七万亩的庄稼。目前，该区晚稻正在抽穗、扬花，生长一般比去年还好。中共嘉兴地委已经指示各地，在收割前，迅速修正和改变原来的部署，把中心工作转入抢收抢种的准备工作，保秋防汛，争取农业丰收。（谭其蔚）
