Hubei farmers in most rural areas, except for some disaster areas, generally have a harvest that is ten percent better than last year. Now, from the hills of eastern Hubei to the banks of the Yangtze River, from the mountains of western Hubei to the Jianghan Plain, farmers throughout the province are actively preparing to pay patriotic agricultural tax to support national economic construction. Many farmers are storing the rice they intend to pay as agricultural tax separately, ensuring that the grains are full and clean. Li Wangqing, a farmer from Berlin Township in Hanyang County, harvested the rice from his best field separately, sun-dried it one more time than usual, and threshed it separately. When winnowing the grain, he designated the grain from the upwind side for agricultural tax, and even stored the grain to be paid in a wooden cabinet separately. Farmers in Zhangqiao Township, Wuchang County, are universally sun-drying the grain to be paid as agricultural tax again and again, winnowing it over and over. The farmers in this township said: "Last year we were a model township for grain delivery, and this year is the first year of the country's first five-year plan, so we must not fall behind." Many farmers are not only preparing well themselves, but also encouraging others. Farmers in Yu's Village, Baiyang Township, Yangxin County, oiled a grain transport boat capable of carrying 1,000 jin of grain as early as two months ago. Recently, they also organized an inspection team to inspect each other's grain to ensure it is clean and full. Many villages and mutual aid teams have also formulated plans for paying agricultural tax. The Zhang Dexing Mutual Aid Team in Luogang Township, Xianning County, decided to: deliver full, golden rice as agricultural tax; universally sun-dry the grain to be paid as agricultural tax two more times and winnow it twice, and stipulated measures to ensure that the grain is not returned. Zeng Qixiang, a farmer from Chenbei Township, Yingcheng County, said: "During land reform, the government distributed land to us, and this year it provided loans for seeds and fertilizer to help solve production difficulties; during the drought, it also set up pumping stations to lead us in overcoming the drought and achieving a bumper harvest, so I selected the one mu of land with the best-grown rice, harvested it separately, threshed it separately, and stored it separately, sun-dried and winnowed it, ready to pay as agricultural tax."

Now, many farmers have prepared the grain to be paid as agricultural tax and are waiting for the government to start collecting it. The Zhang Changyu Mutual Aid Team of Huangtuling in the Second District of Qichun County wrote a letter to the District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in the district, saying: "We have prepared high-quality grain to pay as agricultural tax, as soon as we are notified, whether to send it at Yin time, we will never wait until Mao time."

    湖北农民积极准备缴纳公粮
    湖北省广大农村除部分灾区外，一般收成比去年增产一成。现在，从鄂东丘陵地到荆江两岸，从楚西山地到江汉平原，全省农民为支援国家经济建设，正积极准备缴纳爱国公粮。许多农民把准备缴纳公粮的谷子单藏起来，保证做到籽粒饱满、干净。汉阳县柏林乡农民李望清，把长得最好的一块田的稻谷单独割，比一般谷子多晒一遍，单独打，扬谷时将上风头谷子缴公粮，并且还把应缴的公粮用木柜子单独收藏起来。武昌县张桥乡农民普遍将应缴纳的公粮，晒一遍又一遍，扬一道又一道。该乡农民说：去年我们是交粮模范乡，今年是国家第一个五年计划的第一年，我们更不能落后。许多农民不但自己准备好，并且还推动别人。阳新县白杨乡俞家湾农民早在两个月前就油好了一只能装一千斤的送粮船，最近又组织了检查组，互相检查公粮是不是干净、饱满。许多乡村与互助组还订出了缴纳公粮计划。咸宁县骆岗乡张德兴互助组订出：把饱满金黄的谷子缴公粮；普遍把应缴公粮多晒两次，扬两次，并订出要保证公粮不被退回等办法。应城县陈北乡农民曾启祥说：“土地改革时，政府分田给我们，今年又贷种、贷肥，帮助解决生产上的困难；抗旱时又设立抽水机站，领导我们战胜旱灾，得到丰收，所以我挑出谷子长得最好的一亩田，单割、单打、单收藏，晒干扬净准备缴公粮。”
    现在许多农民已将应缴公粮准备就绪，等候政府开征。蕲春县第二区黄土岭张长玉互助组写信给该区中共区委会说：“我们已准备好上等谷子缴公粮，只要一通知，要寅时送，决不等到卯时。”
