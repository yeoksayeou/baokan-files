    Rongcheng County Party and Government Leading Organs Actively Lead Disaster Area Masses to Drain Water and Save Seedlings
    From Shandong Province, Rongcheng County reader Shi Licong writes: Rongcheng County experienced continuous rainfall from late July to early August, coupled with seawater intrusion, causing waterlogging in some low-lying areas, resulting in significant damage to farmland. Local farmers and some cadres felt helpless. In response to the above situation, the Rongcheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Rongcheng County People's Government decided to make leading the masses in draining water and preventing waterlogging the overriding central task in disaster-stricken areas, and organized 41 capable cadres to lead this work in the severely affected areas; Deputy County Chief Jin Rong also personally led cadres to the tenth district. Under the call of "Save one seedling, gain one seedling" and "Strive to produce more grain on the existing basis," the county quickly launched a campaign to drain water and save seedlings. Putou Township in the first district took the lead in inviting experienced old farmers and labor models to conduct discussions, summarizing past experiences in draining water and saving seedlings, and studying methods for future work. Subsequently, they organized the Peng Jinsheng Agricultural Production Cooperative and several better mutual aid teams to rush to save seedlings, using their practical actions and experience to educate the masses throughout the township. In addition, the county People's Government solved the living difficulties of some severely affected households through appropriations for relief and by launching "social mutual assistance, neighborhood help"; at the same time, it actively led the broad masses of farmers in production for self-salvation. After the above series of work, the morale of the masses has begun to improve. Some farmers said: Under the leadership of the People's Government, no disaster cannot be overcome.

    荣城县党政领导机关积极领导灾区群众排水救苗
    山东省荣城县读者时立聪来信：荣城县在七月下旬至八月上旬间连日降雨，加上海水倒灌，某些低洼地区积水成涝，农田遭到很大损失。当地农民群众和一部分干部都感到束手无策。中共荣城县委员会与荣城县人民政府针对以上情况，决定在受灾地区以领导群众排水防涝为压倒一切的中心任务，并组织了得力干部四十一名，分头到重灾区领导这项工作；副县长金荣同志也亲自带领干部到十区去。在“救一棵、得一棵”和“在现有基础上争取多打粮食”的号召下，全县迅速开展了排水救苗运动。一区蒲头乡首先召请了有经验的老农和劳动模范进行座谈，总结了过去排水救苗的经验，研究了今后工作的办法。接着，又组织彭晋升农业生产合作社和几个较好的互助组进行抢苗，以他们的实际行动和经验来教育全乡群众。此外，县人民政府又以拨款救济和发动“社会互济、亲邻相助”的办法，解决了某些受灾较重户生活上的困难；同时积极领导广大农民生产自救。经过以上一系列的工作，群众情绪已开始提高，有的农民说：在人民政府的领导下，没有战胜不了的灾害。
