Xinhua News Agency, September 21st: State-owned and local state-owned factories and mines across the country are actively engaged in production increase and economy drives, or are formulating plans for production increase and economy, striving to comprehensively overfulfill this year's state plan. In the Northeast region, where the competition started earlier, industrial and mining enterprises in Anshan, Shenyang, Benxi, Fushun, Harbin, and Dalian have all formulated production increase and economy plans and goals. As of early September, more than 170 state-owned and local state-owned factories in Shenyang have launched competitions, of which 95 units have set a goal of increasing production and saving 1,007 billion yuan for the country on the basis of completing the annual state plan. Tens of thousands of basic construction workers in Shenyang have also participated in a labor emulation drive focusing on improving quality and fully implementing "good, fast, economical, and safe." In mid-September, Anshan Iron and Steel Company's various production plants and mines formulated a plan to increase production and save 850 billion yuan. The coal mine system in the Northeast region proposed a plan to increase coal production by more than 300,000 tons. The power industry system launched a labor competition focusing on safe power transmission and burning low-quality coal. In the North China region, industrial and mining enterprises in Beijing, Tianjin, Taiyuan, Tangshan, Shijiazhuang, Zhangjiakou, Baoding, Handan, Xuanhua, and Qinhuangdao also launched competitions successively in September. Many of these cities participating in the competition have either formulated production increase and economy plans or are studying and formulating them. State-owned, local state-owned, and joint state-private industrial departments in the Northwest region have recently drafted a plan to increase production and save 167 billion yuan. Leading organs and enterprise departments in the Southwest, East China, and Central South regions are holding various meetings to formulate or prepare to formulate production increase and economy plans. The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a conference of factory party member cadres on September 17th to conduct in-depth mobilization for production increase and economy and proposed specific methods for carrying out production increase and economy. The Wuhan Metallurgical and Electrical Industry Bureau and the five major textile factories including the State-owned Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory in Wuhan have formulated plans to increase production and save 34.6 billion yuan and 4,459 pieces of yarn. Some state-owned factories in Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming and other cities in the Southwest region have formulated this year's production increase and economy plans. Chongqing China Wool Textile Factory, Chongqing Electrical Equipment Factory and other units have initially proposed a plan to increase production and save 30 billion yuan. Chongqing 101 Iron and Steel Plant has also formulated a plan to increase production and save 100 billion yuan.

    The production increase and economy competition targets and plans proposed by factories and mines across the country are based on the specific circumstances of each factory and mine completing the state plan in the first half of the year. Some factories and mines that did not complete their plans well paid special attention to overcoming shortcomings in their production increase and economy plans or labor competitions in order to achieve comprehensive and overfulfillment of the plan. For example, Tianjin Steel Plant did not complete its steel ingot production plan in the first half of the year, so they took shortening the steelmaking time and doing a good job in furnace protection to increase steel ingot production as the competition goal. Anshan Iron and Steel Company overfulfilled its production tasks in the first half of the year, but costs exceeded the budget by more than 60 billion yuan. Therefore, in the production increase and economy plan, they proposed not only to complete the plan to reduce costs by 50 billion yuan, but also to make up for the losses in the first half of the year, in order to achieve the goal of comprehensively completing the state plan. Qinghe Woolen Mill in Beijing did not complete the quality indicators in the first half of the year, so their production increase and economy competition focused on improving quality as the main goal. Some factories and mines have already completed the state plan but still have potential capacity. They formulate their own production increase and economy plans based on raw material supply and sales conditions. For example, the major products of petroleum, coal, yarn, cloth, and electricity in Northwest State-owned Industry have overfulfilled the state plan in the past eight months. These departments have formulated production increase and economy plans based on the guarantee of raw materials and sales.

    Before launching the production increase and economy competition, party committees at all levels convened meetings of cadres from various factories and mines. In addition to inspecting and summarizing production in the first half of the year, they also put forward specific requirements based on the different circumstances in various places. All localities were required to fully mobilize the masses in the competition, tap potential, find tricks, promote advanced experience, and propose effective methods to complete and overfulfill the state plan. At the same time, factories and mines were required to actively strengthen planning management, establish and improve the responsibility system, in order to achieve the goals of completing production plans and handing over profits.

    各地工矿企业积极进行增产节约
    【新华社二十一日讯】全国各地国营和地方国营工矿企业正在积极开展增产节约竞赛或制订增产节约计划，争取全面超额完成今年的国家计划。竞赛开展比较早的东北区鞍山、沈阳、本溪、抚顺、哈尔滨、旅大等地区的工矿企业，都已制订了增产节约计划和奋斗目标。沈阳市截至九月上旬止，已有一百七十多个国营、地方国营工厂展开了竞赛，其中有九十五个单位提出在完成全年国家计划的基础上为国家增产节约一万零七百亿元的奋斗目标，沈阳市几万个基本建设职工也都参加了以提高质量为主，全面贯彻“好、快、省、安全”为内容的劳动竞赛。鞍山钢铁公司各生产厂矿在九月中旬已制订了增产节约八千五百亿元的计划，东北区的煤矿系统提出了增产三十多万吨煤炭的计划，电业系统开展了以安全送电和烧劣质煤为内容的劳动竞赛。华北区的北京、天津、太原、唐山、石家庄、张家口、保定、邯郸、宣化、秦皇岛等市的工矿企业也都在九月份相继展开了竞赛。这许多城市参加竞赛的厂矿，有的已经制订了增产节约计划，有的正在研究制订。西北区国营、地方国营和公私合营的各工业部门已在最近拟订出增产节约一千六百七十亿元的方案。西南、华东、中南等地区的领导机关和企业部门正在召开各种会议制订或准备制订增产节约计划。中共上海市委已在九月十七日召开了工厂党员干部大会，进行增产节约的深入动员，并提出了开展增产节约的具体办法。武汉市的武汉冶电业局和国营武汉第一棉纺织厂等五大纺织厂，已订出了增产节约三百四十六亿元和四千四百五十九件纱的计划。西南区的重庆、成都、昆明等市的部分国营工厂已制订了今年的增产节约计划，重庆中国毛纺织厂、重庆电工器材厂等单位已初步提出增产节约三百亿元的方案。重庆一零一钢铁厂也订出了增产节约一千亿元的计划。
    各地厂矿所提出的增产节约竞赛目标和增产节约计划，都是根据各厂矿完成上半年国家计划的具体情况确定的。有些厂矿计划完成得不够好，他们在增产节约计划或劳动竞赛中就特别注意了克服缺点，以达到全面和超额完成计划。如天津钢厂上半年钢锭产量没有完成计划，他们就以缩短炼钢时间、做好护炉工作，以增加钢锭产量为竞赛目标。鞍山钢铁公司上半年超额完成了生产任务，但成本超支了六百余亿元。因此，他们在增产节约计划中提出不但要完成降低成本五百亿元的计划，而且还要补足上半年的亏损数字，以达到全面完成国家计划的目的。北京市清河制呢厂上半年没有完成质量指标，他们的增产节约竞赛就以提高质量为主要目标。有些厂矿已经完成了国家计划但仍有潜在能力，他们就根据原材料供应和销路等情况来订出自己的增产节约计划。例如西北国营工业中的石油、煤炭、纱、布、电等主要产品，过去八个月都已超额完成国家计划，这些部门就根据原料和销路有保证的情况，订出了增产节约计划。
    各地在开展增产节约竞赛以前，各级党委都分别召开了各厂矿的干部会议，除检查和总结了上半年的生产外，还根据各地的不同情况，提出了具体要求。各地都要求在竞赛中，充分发动群众，挖掘潜力，寻找窍门，推广先进经验，提出完成和超额完成国家计划的有效办法；同时，要求各厂矿积极加强计划管理，建立和健全责任制，以达到完成生产计划和上缴利润的目的。
