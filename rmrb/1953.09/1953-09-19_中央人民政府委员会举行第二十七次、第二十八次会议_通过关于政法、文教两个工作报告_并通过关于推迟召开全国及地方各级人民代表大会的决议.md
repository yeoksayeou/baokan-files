Xinhua News Agency, 18th: The Central People's Government Committee held its 27th and 28th meetings on the 16th, 17th, and 18th respectively.

    At the 27th meeting, Peng Zhen, Deputy Director of the Political-Legal Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government, delivered a report on political-legal work, and Guo Moruo, Deputy Premier of the State Council of the Central People's Government and Director of the Culture and Education Committee, delivered a report on culture and education work.

    In his report, Deputy Director Peng first described the main situation of the current political-legal work. In terms of political power construction, people's representative conferences of all circles have been widely convened throughout the country; the people's representative conferences of all provinces, cities, and more than one-third of the counties have exercised the functions and powers of the people's congresses; in areas inhabited by ethnic minorities, people's representative conferences of all ethnic groups and all circles have been convened, and ethnic autonomous regions and ethnic democratic coalition governments have been established at all levels. The general election work of grassroots people's congresses is now underway throughout the country. In terms of preferential treatment, more than 50 million mu of land cultivated on behalf of poor revolutionary martyrs' families and revolutionary military personnel families lacking labor have largely approached the level of ordinary people's self-cultivated land in terms of yield. In terms of relief work, some areas in Anhui, Jiangsu, Henan, Shandong, and other provinces suffered from cold waves last year, and some natural disasters also occurred in some areas this year. The central government has successively allocated more than 1,670 billion yuan for relief, and local cadres have actively led the masses in overcoming disasters. In terms of public security work, the large-scale mass movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries has basically been completed nationwide, and unremitting struggle against lurking counter-revolutionaries must continue in the future. Recently, mass movements to ban and disintegrate reactionary secret societies have also been launched in the vast areas of East China, Central South, Southwest, and Northwest China, with nearly four million deceived followers voluntarily withdrawing from the societies. At the same time, education and reform work has been carried out on counter-revolutionaries and unlawful landlords under control in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement. Now many of those under control have expressed remorse, willing to abide by national laws and participate in labor, and have been released from control with the consent of the masses. After labor reform, many counter-revolutionaries and other criminals sentenced to imprisonment have gradually confessed their crimes and obeyed the law, initially developed labor habits, learned production techniques, and are able to engage in legitimate occupations after serving their sentences. In terms of judicial work, after the judicial reform movement, judicial departments across the country have basically drawn a clear line between new and old legal ideologies and changed the serious phenomenon of impure organizations in the past, and have cleared up a large number of backlogged cases and reversed some improperly handled cases in the past. At the Second National Judicial Conference held in April this year, a resolution on specifically strengthening judicial construction work was also made, and people's courts at all levels are actively implementing it. In terms of implementing the Marriage Law, during March and April this year, in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council of the Central People's Government, a movement to publicize and implement the Marriage Law was launched among the broad masses of the people in about 70% of the regions across the country. By focusing the inspection of the implementation of the Marriage Law mainly on the competent departments and their staff, the movement has achieved smooth development and great success. However, about 25% of the regions across the country have not yet universally implemented the Marriage Law. In the future, governments at all levels must regularly check and study the implementation situation to promote and ensure the implementation of the Marriage Law.

    When talking about the main tasks of political-legal work in the future, Deputy Director Peng Zhen pointed out that now that large-scale economic construction has begun, the main tasks of political-legal work in the future are: to gradually improve and utilize the people's democratic legal system, further consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, and continue to complete some social reforms that have not yet been completed in the past, in order to ensure the smooth progress of economic construction, protect the people's democratic rights, and protect state property. To this end, we must continue to be vigilant against the hidden activities of counter-revolutionaries and severely suppress them; other criminals who endanger the country's construction cause and the people's democratic order must also be subject to legal sanctions. We must strengthen the legal education of all state personnel and all citizens, and actively integrate political-legal work into factories, rural areas, and various economic work departments. We must earnestly carry out criticism and self-criticism among government personnel, listen to the opinions of the masses, and accept the supervision and criticism of the people from bottom to top. We must fully protect the people's democratic rights from the legislative aspect and from the aspect of improving the people's judicial, public security, and procuratorial systems. We must continue to resolutely oppose all crimes of corruption and theft of state property, and severely punish all corrupt and thieving elements in accordance with the law. In the work of all departments of political-legal work, we must also earnestly strengthen the ideological leadership of the working class. All political-legal workers, especially leading cadres, must start from scratch, go deep into the masses, go deep into grassroots organizations, humbly learn from the masses, learn from practice, and especially seriously study the Soviet Union's experience in political-legal work, study Marxist-Leninist theory, and study the party and government's various policies to improve the working ability of political-legal workers and successfully complete the tasks assigned to us by the state and the people.

    In his report, Deputy Premier Guo first described the achievements of cultural and educational work over the past three years. He said that over the past three years, New China's cultural and educational work has cooperated with various social reform movements and economic recovery work, and has made considerable achievements in terms of restoration, reform, and development. In terms of education, four-fifths of the country's higher education institutions have carried out departmental adjustments and professional settings, and have begun to universally carry out teaching reform work on this basis. There are now more than 220,000 higher education students, more than 3 million secondary school students, and more than 55 million primary school students nationwide. The number of primary school students exceeds the highest year during the Kuomintang rule (1946) by 135%. The education of workers and peasants and the work of eliminating illiteracy have made considerable progress. At present, about 3 million workers are studying in on-the-job spare time schools. Last year, 42 million peasants enrolled in winter schools, more than half of whom were studying in regular folk schools. In terms of health and sports work, a mass patriotic health movement has been launched since 1952, and the great victory of smashing the bacteriological warfare of American imperialism has been achieved. Health work in various ethnic minority areas has also laid a preliminary foundation. The People's Government is promoting sports among the people and has achieved considerable results. In terms of scientific work, in recent years, the focus has been on reorganizing the organization of scientific research and starting to cooperate with economic and national defense construction to carry out many effective research works. After the return of the Chinese Academy of Sciences delegation to the Soviet Union, it is learning from the Soviet Union's advanced experience and starting to further develop China's scientific research work. In terms of cultural and artistic work, over the past three years, 38 feature films, 83 large and small documentaries have been produced, and more than 100 films from the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries have been translated. The old operas have been preliminarily reformed in terms of content and performance. News publishing work and foreign cultural activities have also greatly developed. The above-mentioned achievements in cultural and educational work have raised the political awareness and cultural level of the people across the country and have helped the economic recovery and development.

    When talking about the shortcomings in cultural and educational work, Deputy Premier Guo pointed out that the main shortcoming in past cultural and educational work was blind adventurism. In order to enable the national cultural and educational work to be more closely integrated with the national economic construction in the early stage of the implementation of the Five-Year Plan in our country, we have put forward "rectification and consolidation, key development, improving quality, and steady advancement" as the general principle for improving cultural and educational work at present. In order to correctly implement this principle, we must oppose both blind adventurism and prevent the conservative tendency of fearing difficulties and being satisfied with the status quo. In the last part of the report, Deputy Premier Guo separately put forward specific tasks in education, health, sports, science, and cultural and artistic aspects, the first of which is to effectively train economic construction talents for the country. Deputy Premier Guo called on intellectuals in education, science, medicine, literature, art, news, and publishing to unite more firmly, study earnestly, improve their work, improve their political and professional level, and work hard to complete the national construction plan.

    At the meeting, Committee members Peng Zemin, Zhang Nanxian, and Chen Jiageng spoke successively on the reports of Deputy Director Peng and Deputy Premier Guo.

    Committee member Peng Zemin said that since the founding of New China, in the short span of four years, political-legal work, like financial and economic work and cultural and educational work, has achieved great and brilliant achievements. Now that our country has begun planned economic construction, political-legal work must strengthen the ideological leadership of the working class and further consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and guarantee the smooth progress of economic construction through a sound people's democratic legal system and people's democratic system.

    Committee member Zhang Nanxian said in his speech that he believed that the various weaknesses caused by the old culture of our country for thousands of years have been completely reversed by Marxist-Leninist thought. In order to make the people of our country stronger, in addition to promoting scientific research work, we must also pay attention to cultivating a strong national character in cultural and educational work.

    Committee member Chen Jiageng said that since liberation, the overseas Chinese's love for the motherland has been increasing day by day, and the number of overseas Chinese youth returning to China to study has also been increasing year by year. In the past, the People's Government has done a lot of work in this regard and has made proper arrangements for the overseas Chinese youth who have returned to China. It is hoped that in the future, under possible conditions, appropriate measures will continue to be taken to further solve the various difficulties that may arise in the overseas Chinese youth's return to China to study.

    At this meeting, other speakers also had in-depth discussions on national economic construction issues.

    After discussion, the meeting unanimously approved the "Report on Political-Legal Work" made by Deputy Director Peng and the "Report on Cultural and Educational Work" made by Deputy Premier Guo.

    At the 28th meeting, Deng Xiaoping, member of the Central Election Committee, gave an explanation on the election of the National People's Congress and local people's congresses at all levels. After listening to the explanation of Committee member Deng Xiaoping, the meeting unanimously adopted the "Resolution on Postponing the Convening of the National People's Congress and Local People's Congresses at All Levels," deciding that the national grassroots election work should generally be completed before the end of January 1954; if some provinces and cities have difficulties, they may postpone it to the end of March 1954 according to the local work situation. The convening of the county people's congress should generally be completed before the end of February 1954; if some provinces have difficulties, they may postpone it to the end of April 1954. As for the time for convening the provincial and municipal people's congresses, it should be connected with the time for convening the National People's Congress, and the time for convening it will be determined separately. The meeting also passed and approved various appointment and removal cases.

    The following attended the two meetings: Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central People's Government, Vice Chairmen Liu Shaoqi, Soong Ching Ling, Li Jishen, Zhang Lan, Gao Gang, Committee members Chen Yi, Li Lisan, Lin Boqu, He Xiangning, Peng Dehuai, Wu Yuzhang, Peng Zhen, Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, Rao Shushi, Chen Jiageng, Deng Zihui, Xu Teli, Cai Chang, Liu Geping, Ma Yinchu, Chen Yun, Lin Feng, Guo Moruo, Deng Xiaoping, Shen Yanbing, Chen Shutong, Situ Meitang, Huang Yanpei, Cai Tingkai, Xi Zhongxun, Peng Zemin, Zhang Zhizhong, Fu Zuoyi, Li Zhuchen, Zhang Bojun, Cheng Qian, Zhang Xiruo, Chen Mingshu, Zhang Nanxian, Liu Yazi, Long Yun.

    中央人民政府委员会举行第二十七次、第二十八次会议
    通过关于政法、文教两个工作报告
    并通过关于推迟召开全国及地方各级人民代表大会的决议
    【新华社十八日讯】中央人民政府委员会在十六日、十七日、十八日分别举行第二十七次、第二十八次会议。
    在第二十七次会议上，中央人民政府政务院政治法律委员会副主任彭真作了关于政治法律工作的报告，中央人民政府政务院副总理兼文化教育委员会主任郭沫若作了关于文化教育工作的报告。
    彭副主任在报告中首先叙述了当前政治法律工作的主要情况。在政权建设方面，全国各地已普遍召开了各界人民代表会议；所有省、市和三分之一以上的县的人民代表会议，已代行了人民代表大会的职权；在少数民族居住地区，多数召开了各族各界人民代表会议，并建立了各级的民族自治区和民族民主联合政府。现在全国各地正进行基层人民代表大会的普选工作。在优抚工作方面：全国为缺乏劳动力的贫苦革命烈士家属、革命军人家属代耕的五千余万亩土地，产量大部接近一般群众自耕土地的水平。在救济工作方面：去年安徽、江苏、河南、山东等省一部分地区遭受寒流侵袭，今年有些地区也发生一些自然灾害。中央已先后拨款一万六千七百余亿元进行救济，当地干部并积极领导群众进行了战胜灾害的工作。在公安工作方面：现在，大张旗鼓的群众性的镇压反革命运动，在全国范围内已基本上完成，今后仍须继续和潜伏的反革命分子进行不懈的斗争。最近在华东、中南、西南、西北的广大地区也展开了取缔和瓦解反动会道门的群众运动，被骗道徒自动退道者近四百万人。同时对在镇压反革命运动中被管制的反革命分子和不法地主分子，进行了教育改造工作，现在已有不少被管制分子表示悔罪，愿意服从国家法令、参加劳动，经群众同意，宣布解除了管制。对于判处徒刑的反革命分子及其他罪犯，在经过劳动改造后，许多罪犯已逐渐认罪服法初步养成了劳动习惯，学会了生产技术，能够于刑满释放后从事正当职业。在司法工作方面：全国各地司法部门经过司法改革运动以后，基本上划清了新旧法律的思想界限和改变了过去组织不纯的严重现象，并清理了大批积案，改判了过去一些处理不妥的案件。在今年四月召开的第二届全国司法会议上，并已作出关于具体加强司法建设工作的决议，现各级人民法院正积极贯彻中。在贯彻婚姻法工作方面：今年三、四月间，根据中共中央和中央人民政府政务院的指示，在全国百分之七十左右地区内，向广大人民群众展开了宣传和贯彻婚姻法运动。并把对婚姻法执行情形的检查，主要放在主管部门及其工作人员方面，这就使运动获得了顺利的开展和极大的成绩。但全国仍有百分之二十五左右的地区，尚未普遍贯彻婚姻法，今后各级政府必须定期检查和研究执行的情况，以促进和保障婚姻法的贯彻。
    在谈到今后政法工作的主要任务时，彭真副主任指出：现在大规模的经济建设已经开始，今后政法工作的主要任务是：逐步健全和运用人民民主的法制，进一步巩固人民民主专政，继续完成过去尚未完成的某些社会改革，以保障经济建设的顺利进行，保护人民的民主权利，保护国家财产。为此，必须继续对反革命分子的隐蔽活动提高警惕，予以严厉镇压；对于其他危害国家建设事业和人民民主秩序的犯罪分子也必须予以法律制裁。必须加强全体国家工作人员和全体国民的守法教育，并积极地使政法工作深入到工厂、农村和各种经济工作部门中去。必须切实开展政府工作人员中的批评和自我批评，倾听群众的意见，接受人民群众自下而上的监督和批评。必须从立法方面，从健全人民司法、公安和检察制度方面，对人民的民主权利充分予以保护。必须继续坚决反对一切贪污、盗窃国家财产的罪行，并依法严厉制裁一切贪污和盗窃分子，在政治法律工作各部门工作中，还必须切实加强工人阶级的思想领导。全体政法工作人员，特别是领导干部，必须从头学起，深入到群众中去，深入到基层组织中去，虚心向群众学习，向实际学习，特别是要认真地学习苏联关于政治法律工作的经验，学习马克思列宁主义的理论，学习党和政府的各项政策以提高政法工作人员的工作能力，胜利地完成国家和人民所交给我们的任务。
    郭副总理在报告中，首先叙述了三年多来文化教育工作的成就。他说：三年多来新中国的文化教育工作配合着各项社会改革运动和经济恢复工作，在恢复、改革和发展方面有了不少成绩。在教育方面：全国四分之三的高等学校进行了院系调整和专业设置工作，并在这个基础上开始普遍地进行教学改革工作。现在全国共有高等学校学生二十二万多人，中等学校学生三百多万人，小学校学生五千五百多万人，小学生数超过国民党统治时期最高年份（一九四六年）百分之一百三十五。工农群众的教育和扫除文盲的工作有了相当大的发展。目前在职工业余学校学习的职工约有三百万人。去年冬学农民入学的达四千二百万人，其中半数以上在常年民校学习。在卫生体育工作方面：一九五二年以来开展了群众性的爱国卫生运动，并取得了粉碎美帝国主义细菌战的伟大胜利。各少数民族地区的卫生工作也打下了初步基础。人民政府正在人民群众中推广体育运动，并收到相当的成效。在科学工作方面：几年来着重整顿科学研究的组织，并开始配合经济和国防建设，进行了许多有效的研究工作。中国科学院访苏代表团回国后，正在学习苏联的先进经验，着手进一步开展我国的科学研究工作。在文化艺术工作方面：三年多来出产了电影故事片三十八部，大、小型纪录片八十三部，翻译了苏联和各人民民主国家影片一百多部。旧有戏曲在内容和演出方面已作了初步改革。新闻出版工作和对外文化活动，也有很大的发展。上述文教工作方面的成就，提高了全国人民群众的政治觉悟和文化水平，帮助了经济的恢复和发展。
    在谈到文化教育工作中的缺点时，郭副总理指出：过去文教工作中的主要缺点在于盲目冒进。为使全国文教工作在我国实行五年建设计划的初期更能密切地结合国家经济建设，我们提出了“整顿巩固、重点发展、提高质量、稳步前进”作为当前改进文教工作的总方针。为了正确地贯彻这个方针，既要反对盲目冒进，又要防止害怕困难、满足于现状的保守主义倾向。在报告的最后部分，郭副总理分别提出了教育、卫生、体育、科学、文化艺术几方面的具体任务，首先就是有效地为国家培养经济建设人才的任务。郭副总理号召全国教育、科学、医药、文艺、新闻、出版各方面的知识分子更加巩固地团结起来，认真学习，改进工作，提高自己的政治水平和业务水平，为完成国家建设计划而努力。
    会上彭泽民委员、张难先委员、陈嘉庚委员，曾就彭副主任和郭副总理的报告相继发言。
    彭泽民委员说，新中国成立以来，在短短的四年中，政法工作和财经、文教工作一样，有伟大辉煌的成就。现当我国开始有计划的经济建设时，政法工作要加强工人阶级的思想领导，通过健全的人民民主的法制和人民民主制度，来进一步巩固人民民主专政，保障经济建设的顺利进行。
    张难先委员在发言中认为我国几千年来旧文化所造成的各种弱点，已被马克思列宁主义思想所完全扭转过来。为了使我国人民更加刚强起来，在文教工作中，除了要提倡科学研究工作，还要注意培植坚强的民族性格。
    陈嘉庚委员说，解放以来，海外华侨热爱祖国的心情是日益增高的，华侨青年回国求学的人数也在逐年增加。过去，人民政府已经在这方面作了很多工作，对回国的华侨青年作了妥善安置，希望今后在可能的条件下，继续采取适当的措施，以进一步解决华侨青年回国学习中可能发生的各种困难。
    在这次会议上，其他发言者还就国家经济建设问题进行了深入的讨论。
    会议经过讨论，一致通过了彭副主任所作的“关于政治法律工作的报告”和郭副总理所作的“关于文化教育工作的报告”。
    在第二十八次会议上，中央选举委员会邓小平委员就全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会的选举问题作了说明。会议在听了邓小平委员的说明后，一致通过了关于推迟召开全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会的决议，决定全国基层选举工作，一般推迟到一九五四年一月底以前完成；有些省市如有困难，尚可根据当地工作情况，推迟到一九五四年三月底以前完成。县人民代表大会的召开，一般应于一九五四年二月底以前完成；有些省份如有困难，尚可推迟到一九五四年四月底以前完成。至于省、市人民代表大会的召开时间，应与全国人民代表大会的召开时间相衔接，其召开时间另定之。会议并通过和批准了各项任免案。
