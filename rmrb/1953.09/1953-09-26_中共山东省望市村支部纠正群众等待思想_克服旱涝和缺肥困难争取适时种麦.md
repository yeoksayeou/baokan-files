The CCP Wangshi Village Branch in Laiyang County, Shandong Province, is correcting the masses’ mentality of “waiting for the land to dry,” “waiting for rain,” and “waiting for fertilizer,” and strengthening leadership in autumn plowing and wheat planting.

Two-thirds of the cultivated land in Wangshi Village is plains, some of which are still flooded, and farmers are waiting for the land to dry before plowing. In addition, the hilly land and non-flooded sticky soil have been dry in recent days, and farmers are not actively plowing, but are waiting for rain. Therefore, even though it is time for sowing, some farmers have not started plowing. The village’s fertilizer accumulation work has also been affected by the heavy rains this summer. The average household has accumulated a quarter less manure than last year, and individual households with no labor force have accumulated a third or half less than last year. Some farmers have not actively sought solutions to the problem of fertilizer shortage. Some plan to reduce the area sown in autumn, while others plan to use soybeans as fertilizer after harvesting them, so the phenomenon of waiting for fertilizer and late planting is also common.

After studying the masses’ thinking, the CCP Wangshi Village Branch convened座谈会 meetings of various types of mutual aid team leaders and experienced farmers, using local examples for comparison, calculating time, and calculating the benefits of increased production. In the past, the Xin Shaochen mutual aid team plowed the land as soon as the millet was harvested. For land that could not be plowed immediately, they hoed it once to clear the stubble, and for flooded land, they drained it in time, preventing both drought and flood, and planting in a timely manner (around the Autumn Equinox). Therefore, their wheat crops have been bountiful year after year. Last year, they harvested seventy or eighty catties more per mu than the average farmer, and this year they harvested forty or fifty catties more. Because the Jiang Zuoli mutual aid team has always found ways to accumulate more fertilizer, they have enough fertilizer to meet the needs of planting. This year, the average wheat yield per mu in the whole team was fifty-five catties more than that of the masses. On the other hand, those households who waited for fertilizer and planted after the Cold Dew period did not allow the wheat to take root before the ground froze, and many plants were damaged by frost in winter. The ripening period was also delayed until the following year, resulting in an average yield reduction of 50% compared to the average farmer. As for the masses who were waiting for rain, they recalled and compared the situation in 1950: those households who responded to the government’s call and actively fought drought and planted seeds reaped a good harvest because they planted in a timely manner; those households who waited for rain and planted late not only reduced the planting area but also harvested half the grain. After such enlightenment and education, many people corrected their waiting mentality and came up with ways to overcome difficulties and strive for timely planting. The methods adopted by the masses in the village to strive for timely planting are: to quickly drain water from low-lying areas by various means, plowing and planting each piece of land as it dries; to harrow the already dry land first to prevent moisture evaporation, and to plow slightly dry land in the early morning when it is relatively moist; to water the land the night before and plow it the next morning, or to carry water for planting. Regarding the problem of fertilizer shortage, on the one hand, they actively open up fertilizer sources, and on the other hand, they adopt the method of plowing and planting first without waiting for fertilizer, applying the existing fertilizer evenly to the land, waiting for urine application in winter and topdressing in the spring. At the same time, in order to ensure vigorous wheat growth and prevent frost damage, five or six catties of chemical fertilizer are applied per mu during planting. In this way, the village will not reduce the planting area and can ensure timely planting.

    中共山东省望市村支部纠正群众等待思想
    克服旱涝和缺肥困难争取适时种麦
    中共山东省莱阳县望市村支部纠正群众“等地干”、“等雨”、“等粪”的思想，加强秋耕种麦的领导工作。
    望市村平原地占耕地面积的三分之二，其中有部分洼地的积水至今仍未排除，农民等待地干后才耕种；另外，丘陵地和无积水的粘土地，则因为最近多日无雨，呈现旱象，农民也不积极耕种，只等待下雨；因此，该村直到下种的季节，还有部分农民没有动手耕地。该村还因为今年夏季多雨，影响了积肥工作，全村一般户比去年少积四分之一的粪，个别无劳力的户则比去年少积三分之一或二分之一。部分农民对于缺肥的问题也没有积极设法解决，有的人打算减少秋种面积，有的人等待打了豆子以后，以豆子充作肥料，所以等粪晚种的现象也是普遍的。
    中共望市村支部研究了群众的思想情况后，就召开了各种不同类型的互助组长和老农座谈会，通过当地的事例，进行对比，算时间，算增产的账。该村辛绍臣互助组往年割了谷就耕地，对不能马上耕的地，先耪一遍茬子，对积水地则及时排水，作到了旱涝并防，适时（秋分前后）播种，因此，小麦年年丰收。去年每亩地比一般群众多收七、八十斤，今年多收四、五十斤。姜作礼互助组因为年年想法多积肥，肥能够得上种地的需要，今年全组的小麦每亩平均比群众多打五十五斤；而其他等有了粪，到寒露以后才种的户，小麦没有在封冻前扎下根去，冬天就冻坏了不少，到第二年成熟期又推迟，平均比一般群众减产百分之五十。对于等雨的群众，则回忆对比了一九五○年的情况：当时响应了政府号召，积极抗旱点种的户，因为作到了适时播种都得到丰收；等雨晚种的户，不但减少了播种面积，而且还少打了一半粮食。经过这样启发教育，许多人都纠正了等待的思想，想出办法克服困难，争取适时播种。该村群众争取适时播种的办法是：尽速用各种办法排除洼地积水，干一块就耕一块，耕一块就种一块；对已经干旱的地，先耙后耕，防止水分蒸发，对稍干的地，可抓紧时间在早晨较湿时耕，对耙后仍耕不起来的地，则采取头天晚上泼水，第二天早上耕，或挑水播种的办法；对于缺粪的问题，一方面积极开辟粪源上粪，另一方面，则采取不等粪，先耕种的办法，把现有的粪匀和着施到地里，以待冬天浇尿，明春追肥。同时，为了保证麦苗生长旺盛，免受冻害，播种时每亩地施五、六斤化学肥料。这样，该村既不会减少播种面积，又可保证适时播种。
