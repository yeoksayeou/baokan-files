    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 25th: TASS Moscow, September 24th: "Pravda" commentator I. Pavlov wrote in the newspaper's international commentary column: The Soviet delegation attending the Eighth Session of the United Nations General Assembly’s proposal at the UN General Assembly on "Measures to Eliminate the Threat of Another World War and Ease International Tensions" is a very important event.
    Extremely broad strata in Asia, Europe, and the Americas are increasingly and resolutely demanding the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction and disarmament. The Soviet proposal is in line with these demands. The Soviet proposal suggests first unconditionally prohibiting atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction. The premise on which the Soviet proposal is based is that the arms race in some countries has not only not relaxed but is continuing on a larger scale; because atomic energy is used for destructive purposes, weapons of mass destruction are more harmful and more terrifying to millions of people.
    If an international agreement can be reached on the prohibition of weapons of great destructiveness and danger, it will prove that the governments of the countries participating in the United Nations are sincerely hoping to stop the "power politics" pursued by international aggressors, and prove their determination to embark on the road of international cooperation.
    For the sake of the security of all countries, the United Nations has the responsibility to pass this important resolution and implement it as an unchangeable international law.
    For the benefit of peace, the Soviet delegation proposed disarmament, suggested that the General Assembly condemn the propaganda that is being carried out in some countries to incite hostility and hatred among the people of all countries and to incite new wars, and requested all countries to take measures to stop this propaganda that violates the main principles and purposes of the United Nations.
    Pavlov emphasized: All democratic newspapers that welcome the Soviet proposal unanimously believe that the adoption of the Soviet proposal will ease international tensions. However, under the direction of the State Department, the reactionary American newspapers are trying to bury the essence of the Soviet proposal with empty words.
    Pavlov finally said that broad strata around the world are waiting for the United Nations to give a straightforward answer to this straightforward question.

    “真理报”评苏联巩固和平提案的重大意义
    【新华社二十五日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十四日讯：“真理报”评论员伊·巴夫洛夫在该报国际述评栏中写道：出席联合国第八届大会的苏联代表团，在联合国大会上提出的“关于消除另一次世界大战的威胁和缓和国际紧张局势的措施”的提案，是一件十分重要的事件。
    亚洲、欧洲和美洲大陆各地极广泛的阶层，越来越坚决地要求禁止大规模的毁灭性武器和裁减军备。苏联的提案是符合这些要求的。苏联提案建议，首先无条件禁止原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器。苏联提案所根据的前提是：在若干国家内，扩张军备的竞赛不但没有放松，而且正在以更大的规模继续进行；由于原子能被用于毁灭目的，大规模杀人武器对于千百万人民是更有害和更可怕了。
    如果在禁止有极大毁灭性和危险性的武器方面能够达成国际协议，那就会证明参加联合国的各国政府是真诚地希望制止国际侵略分子所执行的“实力政策”，并证明它们决心走上国际合作的道路。
    联合国为了各国的安全，有责任通过这一项重要的决议，并把它作为一项不可更改的国际法规付诸实施。
    苏联代表团为了和平的利益，建议裁减军备，建议大会谴责正在若干国家内进行的、煽动各国人民之间的敌意和仇视并鼓动新战争的宣传，并要求一切国家采取措施来制止这种违背联合国的主要原则和宗旨的宣传。
    巴夫洛夫着重指出：一切欢迎苏联建议的民主报纸都异口同声地认为：通过苏联的提案，就会使国际紧张局势趋于缓和。但是，美国反动报纸在国务院的指使下，正企图用空泛的言词来埋没苏联提案的实质。
    巴夫洛夫最后说，全世界广大的阶层正等待着联合国对这个直接了当的问题，提出直接了当的答复。
