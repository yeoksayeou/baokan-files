A Message to the Soldiers

    I Salute You in the Name of a Mother
    Sun Wenzhi

    Dear Volunteer Army comrades:
    I am an ordinary mother with three children. For the past few months, I have been reading a great epic over and over again – the hundred and some letters you wrote to me. Dear comrades, this is an epic you wrote with blood and life! In every letter, you call me "Mom" or "Mother," and you pour out your great love for world peace, your love for the motherland, and your love for the mothers and children of the motherland. How can I describe the emotion I have received?
    I firmly remember your vigorous assurances and vows. In his letter, soldier Wan Fufeng said: "Dear Mother, please open your diary and write down my words. My comrades around me, including company commander Yang Ruxing and political instructor Xu Rongguang, are all determined to shoot down more enemy planes to defend the motherland, to defend the motherland's first five-year construction plan, and to defend the mothers and children of the motherland." There is also Comrade Dai Shaoji, who is from Shanghai and already has many children and grandchildren, but he still joined the Volunteer Army without hesitation and is engaged in repair work. In his letter, he said: "Comrade Wenzhi, I assure you that we will strive to complete the important tasks given to us by Chairman Mao and the people of the whole country. We will not return to the motherland until the Korean issue is peacefully resolved; we are determined to fight to the end for the happiness of the next generation of children..."

    One evening in July, I came home from work and, as soon as I walked up the stairs, I heard someone talking in my room:
    "Look, this letter is so moving, they love the motherland and the mothers and children of the motherland so much!"
    I guessed immediately that it was my friends – young mothers – rummaging through your letters again. I walked in quietly, and they had spread all the letters I had carefully organized and stored all over the table. At that time, I felt a little angry. But, seeing their expressions of fascination and emotion, I couldn't help but blame myself: Why be angry? Isn't every heart of the motherland in Korea, with you, accompanying you? Your words in the letters are not just for me, but for the thousands upon thousands of mothers in the motherland!

    For the past few months, I have been guessing on my way home every day: How many letters will I receive from you today? Three? Four? Sometimes, as soon as I get home, the children will rush to hand me your letters, and even the youngest child will rush to say to me: "Mom, it's another letter from the Volunteer Army uncles!" Then, they would ask me to tell them the contents of the letters. Sometimes they would invite their little friends to listen to me read. They have asked such questions more than once: "Why did the Volunteer Army uncles go to Korea?" "Are the Volunteer Army uncles suffering in Korea?" "Do the Volunteer Army uncles miss home?"…

    Dear comrades, your letters have answered their questions satisfactorily. Look, Wang Chunsu wrote in his letter: "Recently, the higher authorities wanted to transfer me back to the country for study, but I repeatedly requested the higher authorities to keep me in Korea, I want to serve the people of the motherland on the front line of the struggle! Comrade Wenzhi, it's not that I don't miss the motherland, on the contrary, I often dream of it. I have the same wish as you, for the sake of innocent and lively children, I want to stay in Korea, defend the motherland, defend peace, and defend the children." Besides this, what else can I tell the children?

    Recently, I have noticed that the children are enthusiastically engaged in an activity – drawing pictures. They drew all kinds of pictures and asked me to enclose them in letters to send to you. They drew trains full of goods, saying they were to support you in winning more battles; they drew tanks and planes, saying they were to send to you to kill more enemies; they drew Tiananmen Square, because they knew you missed Chairman Mao; they sent you their own photos, and they even wrote "To Volunteer Army Uncles" and their own names crookedly on the back of the photos, because they knew you cared about the children of the motherland. One night, it was already past ten o'clock, and my second child suddenly talked in her sleep: "Red crayon, red crayon!" Suddenly she started touching all over the bed. I knew that she was dreaming again about drawing Tiananmen Square to send to the Volunteer Army uncles.

    Once, when I read Comrade Wang Chunsu's second letter to the children, they all jumped up with joy. Comrade Wang Chunsu's letter said: "The children's photos are very welcome to us Volunteer Army soldiers. Before your letter was even handed to me, the photos were taken away by others, and only one was left for me, the one that the children personally wrote 'Volunteer Army Uncle' on with their little hands! When I am fighting on the battlefield full of artillery fire, or sleeping in the snowy mountains and forests, seeing the children and thinking of the children can encourage me to kill the enemy, help me overcome difficulties, and make me feel great comfort and warmth."

    Now that the Korean armistice has been signed, the mothers of the motherland are even more happy. I often think of the scene of you walking out of the firing range, holding up your weapons, and shouting "Long live peace!" But, for this victory, what a great price you paid! Huang Jiguang and Qiu Shaoyun sacrificed their great youthful lives for this, as everyone knows. At this time, I also think of another great warrior, Chen Shirong, who sacrificed his life for victory this June.

    That was what Comrade Zhang Zhufang told me in his letter of June 30th. In the battle to counterattack Jiaoyan Mountain, the strong and great warrior Comrade Chen Shirong, after rushing to the enemy's main peak, had his left leg blown up, but he endured the pain and climbed up the main peak, bandaged the wound, and formed a combat team with the other two warriors who rushed up the main peak, Xia Yumin and Yang Jinhui, to defend the newly captured position. The enemy's two consecutive counterattacks were repelled by them. Suddenly, a shell flew over and shrapnel landed on Comrade Shirong's back, and he was seriously wounded for the second time, and the fortification was also blown down. When he woke up, he immediately said: "Don't worry about me, quickly repair the fortifications, monitor the enemy, I will clean the guns." He endured the pain and cleaned the weapons for the three of them. The next day at dawn, the enemy launched another counterattack with more troops, and Chen Shirong struggled to get up and shoot at the enemy. At this time, an incendiary bomb flew over and ignited the signal flare on his body, and flames were burning on his body. Xia Yumin rushed over to put out the fire for him, but he shot with one hand and said: "Don't worry about me, the position is important, the fire on my body will easily attract the enemy's firepower, you should quickly turn to the side to fight." He also shouted loudly: "We are the most beloved people, we must do the most beloved things!" The enemy concentrated all their firepower on the burning fire, and Comrade Chen Shirong gloriously sacrificed at this time. And his comrades, under his encouragement and cover, completely repelled the enemy's counterattack and bought time for the main force to reach the main peak, like a sharp knife inserted in front of Jiaoyan Mountain.

    Whenever the night is quiet and I am reading your letters or writing replies to you, I will think of this letter, I will think of that heroic martyr Chen Shirong, and I can't help but go to my children's beds, looking at their sleeping red faces, I feel the children are more lovely, and I feel your greatness even more.

    In a few days, school will start, and my eight-year-old eldest daughter has been admitted to the first grade of elementary school, and my five-year-old second daughter has also been admitted to the small class of kindergarten. I thought of the scene when they were packing their schoolbags, crayons, and paper blocks the day before yesterday. At that time, the second daughter suddenly asked me innocently: "Mom, if there is no war, when will the Volunteer Army uncles come back and come to our house?" Just as I was thinking about how to answer her, the eldest child immediately chimed in and said: "Mom, didn't you say that the American wolves are still in Korea? If the Volunteer Army uncles come back, what will we do if the American wolves come to fight us?" Comrades, dear comrades, I think you are satisfied with the children's answers. How profoundly has your heroic struggle to defend peace, defend the motherland, and defend the thousands upon thousands of mothers and children of the motherland educated the people of the motherland! The mothers and children of the motherland have thousands of words of gratitude to say to you. Even if I write for days and nights, can I express even one ten-thousandth of this gratitude?

    The night is already very late. Stars are all over the sky, a cool breeze is blowing through this city, and crickets are chirping in the garden lawn. I gazed eastward for a moment, as if it was turning white there. I can't tell the time, I think the morning sun may be rising in your place soon. Comrades, in the name of a mother, I wish you peace and pay you the highest respect!

    Late night of August 16th in Shanghai

### 我以母亲的名义向你们致敬

    我以母亲的名义向你们致敬
    孙文芝亲爱的志愿军战士同志们：
    我是一个普通的母亲，跟前有三个孩子。几个月来，我几乎每天都在一遍又一遍地读着一部伟大的史诗——你们写给我的一百几十封来信。亲爱的同志们，这是你们用鲜血与生命写下的史诗啊！在每一封来信里，你们都把我叫作“妈妈”或者“母亲”，你们都向我倾吐着你们热爱世界和平，热爱祖国，热爱祖国的母亲和孩子们的伟大的感情。我怎样来形容我所受到的感动呢？
    我牢牢地记得你们那雄劲有力的保证和誓言。战士万扶风的信中说：“亲爱的母亲，请你打开日记本，把我的话记下来。我和我周围的战友，包括连长杨如兴，政治指导员许荣光在内，都决心以击落更多的敌机来保卫祖国，保卫祖国第一个五年建设计划，保卫祖国的母亲和孩子们。”还有一位戴绍基同志，家在上海，他已经是儿孙满堂的人了，可是他还是那样奋不顾身地参加了志愿军，担任着修械工作。他在来信中说：“文芝同志，我向你保证：毛主席和全国人民所交给我们的重大任务，我们一定要努力完成。朝鲜问题一天没有和平解决，我们一天不回祖国；我们坚决为下一代孩子的幸福而奋斗到底……。”
    七月的一个傍晚，我下班回家，刚走上楼梯，就听到有人在我的房间里说话：
    “你看，这封信实在太感动人了，他们多么热爱祖国，热爱祖国的母亲和孩子们啊！”
    我一下就猜到，又是我那几个朋友——年轻的母亲——来翻腾你们的来信了。我轻轻地走进去，她们又把我整理得整整齐齐收藏好的来信，翻得满桌都是。当时我心里很有几分生气。但，看到她们那种被吸引被感动的神情，我禁不住又责备起自己来：干么生气呢？祖国母亲的每一颗心，不是都在朝鲜，都在你们身上，伴随着你们吗？你们信上的话也不是给我一个说的，而是给祖国千千万万母亲们说的呀！
    几个月来，我每天在回家的路上都会这样猜：今天会收到你们的几封来信呢？三封？四封？有时一回到家里，孩子们就会抢着把你们的来信递给我，顶小的孩子，也急急忙忙地抢着对我说：“妈妈，又是志愿军叔叔写来的！”接着，她们就要求我把信的内容讲给她们听。有时候她们还邀请她们的小朋友来听我念。她们不只一次地提出这样的问题：“志愿军叔叔为什么到朝鲜去呢？”“志愿军叔叔在朝鲜苦吗？”“志愿军叔叔想家吗？”……
    亲爱的同志们，你们的来信，都很满意地答复了她们的问题。看吧，王纯素的来信里这样写着：“最近，上级要调我回国学习，但我向上级再三要求，希望把我留在朝鲜，我要为祖国人民服务在斗争的最前线！文芝同志，我不是不想祖国，相反，常常做梦都看到它，我和你的愿望一样，为了天真活泼的孩子，我要留在朝鲜，保卫祖国，保卫和平，保卫孩子。”除此之外，我还能给孩子们再说些什么呢？
    近来，我发现孩子们在热衷地进行着一种活动——画图。她们画了各种各样的图画，要我附在信里寄给你们。她们画了满载东西的火车，说是支援你们多打胜仗；画了坦克飞机，说是送给你们多杀敌人；画了天安门，因为知道你们想念毛主席；把她们自己的照片送给你们，还在照片背面歪歪斜斜地写上“送给志愿军叔叔”和她们自己的名字，因为知道你们关心着祖国的孩子。一天夜里，已经十点多钟了，我的第二个孩子，忽然说起梦话：“红蜡笔，红蜡笔！”突然她又在床上到处摸起来。我知道，她在梦中又想起来画天安门寄给志愿军叔叔的事了。
    有一次，当我给孩子们念了王纯素同志的第二封来信时，她们都高兴得跳起来了。王纯素同志的来信说：“孩子们的照片，我们志愿军都是非常欢迎的，你那封来信还没有递到我的手里，照片就被别人拿走了，只给我留了一张，那就是孩子们用小手亲笔写着‘志愿军叔叔’的一张啊！我战斗在炮火激烈的战场上，或露宿在积雪的山林里，看到孩子们，想到孩子们，就能鼓舞杀敌的勇气，就能帮助我克服困难，就能使我感到莫大的安慰和温暖。”
    现在，朝鲜停战了，祖国母亲们的心情是更加愉快了。我常常想到你们走出了射击台，高举着武器，欢呼“和平万岁”的情景。但是，为了这一胜利，你们付出多大的代价呀！黄继光、邱少云正是因此而献出他们伟大的青春的生命，这是大家所熟知的。这时我又想起今年六月另一个为了胜利而献出自己生命的伟大战士陈世荣。
    那是张竺芳同志在六月三十日的来信中告诉我的。在反击轿岩山的战斗中，顽强伟大的战士陈世荣同志，在冲到敌人的主峰前，左腿被炸伤了，但是他忍着剧痛爬上了主峰，裹扎了一下伤口，就和另外两个冲上主峰的战士夏玉民、杨金辉组成了一个战斗小组，守住新攻下的阵地。敌人一连两次的反扑都被他们打退了，突然，一颗炮弹飞打过来，弹片落到世荣同志的背上，他第二次又负了重伤，工事也被炸塌了。当他苏醒过来时，立刻说：“不要管我，快修工事，监视敌人，我来擦枪。”他忍着剧痛，擦好了三个人的武器。第二天天一明，敌人用更多的兵力又反扑上来了，陈世荣挣扎起来射击敌人。这时，一颗燃烧弹打过来，把他的身上的信号弹打着了，烈火在他身上燃烧起来，夏玉民急忙过来给他扑火，而他却一面单手射击，一面说：“不要管我，阵地重要，我身上的火光容易吸引敌人的火力，你们快转到旁边去打。”还高声喊：“咱们是最可爱的人，要做最可爱的事！”敌人把火力都集中在火光燃烧的地方，陈世荣同志就在这时光荣地牺牲了。而他的战友就在他的鼓舞与掩护下，全部击退了敌人的反扑，争取了时间，使主力部队到达了主峰，像一把尖刀似地插在轿岩山前。
    每当夜深人静，我在读着你们的来信，或者给你们写回信的时候，我就会想到这封信，会想到那位英雄的陈世荣烈士，我又不由得要走到我的小孩的床前，看着她们熟睡的红红的小脸，我更觉得孩子的可爱，也更觉得你们的伟大了。
    再过几天，学校就要开学了，我那八岁的大女孩子已经考取了小学一年级，五岁的二女孩子也考进了幼儿园小班。我想起了前天她们在整理书包、蜡笔、纸块时的情景。那时，二女孩子忽然天真地问我：“妈妈，不打仗了，志愿军叔叔啥时候回来，到我们家里来呀？”我正想怎样来回答她，大孩子却立刻接过去说：“妈妈，不是说美国狼还在朝鲜吗？志愿军叔叔回来了，美国狼来打我们怎么办呢？”同志们，亲爱的同志们，孩子的回答我想你们是满意的。你们为保卫和平，保卫祖国，保卫祖国千千万万母亲和孩子的英勇斗争，是如何深刻地教育了祖国人民啊！祖国的母亲和孩子们有千言万语感激的话要向你们说，我就是再写几天几夜，能表达这种感激的万分之一吗？
    夜，已经很深了。星星满布在天空，清凉的风吹拂着这个城市，蟋蟀在庭园的草地里叫着。我向东方凝望了一刻，好像那里正在发白，我算不准时间，我想清晨的太阳也许就要在你们那里升起了。同志们，我以一个母亲的名义祝你们平安，向你们致最崇高的敬礼！
    八月十六日深夜于上海
