    On the eve of National Day, Beijing is filled with a festive atmosphere. The people of the capital, participating in the great Five-Year Construction Plan, are welcoming National Day with new achievements.

    Tiananmen, illuminated by the early autumn sun, appears particularly solemn and magnificent. Large red palace lanterns hang neatly on the towering gate tower; workers are making final decorations and cleaning the square. On the green central islands of East and West Chang'an Avenue, gardeners are cultivating autumn flowers. Many tall buildings around Tiananmen have been fitted with five-colored electric lights. In the Working People's Cultural Palace, northeast of Tiananmen, colorful arches have been erected among the lush ancient cypress trees. A celebration garden party for 100,000 people will be held here on October 2nd.

    On the eve of the festival, the people of the capital, immersed in a surge of increasing production and practicing economy, have achieved new victories. The red flags fluttering on the tall construction frames mark the emergence of new records every day. Workers are exceeding their competition plans to welcome the great festival. The geophysical and classroom buildings of the Beijing Iron and Steel Institute, and other major projects, are being completed four days ahead of schedule for each floor. The Qinghe Woolen Mill completed its September production increase and economy plan three days ahead of schedule. Railway workers are rushing to make a giant slogan board, which will state their plan for this year: Strive to increase production and economize by 300 billion yuan! The North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory has new products coming off the production line, and workers will carry models of double-wheeled double-furrow plows to participate in the parade.

    In the fields on the outskirts of Beijing, farmers are determined to make next year's harvest even richer than this year's, and they are carefully sowing wheat. The Zhangguozhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative guarantees to complete the plowing and harrowing of 300 mu of land before National Day. The tractor station in the southern suburbs is operating huge machines to help farmers cultivate the land.

    The streets and alleys of the capital are filled with joy. Many Young Pioneers, wearing red scarves, return from school with newly made bouquets ready to participate in the festival parade. Markets and shops are crowded with customers, and girls are choosing brightly colored dresses. On September 30th, the Beijing branch of the China Department Store will add two new sales departments on East Chang'an Avenue and Tianqiao to meet people's festive needs. Colorful arches have been erected at the entrances of many organizational stores. In the shop windows of the Xidan district, where the general election is about to begin, various propaganda paintings depicting the democratic life of the people are posted, and workers, shop assistants, and street residents are rehearsing ballads about the general election. The various theater troupes are preparing wonderful programs for the festival evening.

    As the motherland enters the first year of planned construction, the people of the capital are excitedly welcoming the great festival and looking forward to a bright future with full confidence.

    国庆节的前夕，北京已处处呈现着节日的景象。参加伟大五年建设的首都人民正以新的成就迎接国庆节的到来。
    天安门，在初秋阳光的照耀下，显得格外庄严和灿烂。大红宫灯整齐地高悬在巍峨的门楼上；工人们正在广场上作最后的装饰和清扫工作。东西长安街各个绿色的中央岛上，花匠们在栽培秋季的花卉。天安门四周许多高大的建筑物上，已安上了五色的电灯。在天安门的东北侧的劳动人民文化宫里，苍翠的古柏林中搭起了彩牌。十月二日，这里将举行十万人的庆祝游园大会。
    节日前夕，投入增产节约热潮的首都人民获得了新胜利。工地高大建筑架上飘扬的红旗，标志着每天都有新纪录出现。工人们以超额完成竞赛计划来迎接伟大节日。北京钢铁学院工地理化大楼和教室大楼等较大工程，每层楼都提前四天完工。清河制呢厂提前三日完成九月份增产节约计划。铁路工人们在赶做一个巨型的标语牌，标语牌上将写着他们今年的计划：为增产节约三千亿元而奋斗！华北农业机械总厂又有新的产品出厂，工人们将扛着双轮双铧犁的模型参加游行。
    在京郊的田野里，农民们决心要使明年的收成比今年更丰富，他们正在精细地播种小麦。张郭庄的农业生产合作社保证在国庆节前完成三百亩地的耕耙。南郊的拖拉机站，正开动巨大的机器，帮助农民们耕地。
    首都的大街小巷洋溢着喜悦。许多系着红领巾的少年先锋队员们，下课回来拿着新扎的准备参加节日游行的花束。市场和商店里挤满顾客，姑娘们在挑选颜色鲜艳的衣裙。九月三十日，中国百货公司北京市公司将在东长安街、天桥增设两座门市部，以满足人们节日的需要，不少机关商店的门口，已搭上彩色的牌楼。即将开始普选的西单区各商店的橱窗里，张贴着各种描绘人民民主生活的宣传画，工人、店员、街道市民正排演说唱普选的杂剧。各剧团正为节日的晚会准备精彩节目。
