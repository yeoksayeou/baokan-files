Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 2nd: According to TASS, the Soviet Peace Committee held an enlarged plenary session on August 31st at the October Hall of the Trade Union Building in Moscow. The meeting was attended by representatives of the Peace Committees of the Soviet Union's various republics, border regions, and states, representatives of the Soviet Trade Unions, the Central Committee of the Soviet Leninist Young Communist League, the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee, the Soviet Youth Anti-Fascist Committee, and other public organizations, as well as scientists and cultural workers, advanced workers in industry and agriculture, and active fighters in the Soviet people's struggle for peace.

The plenary session was opened by the writer Ilya Ehrenburg.

Nikolai Tikhonov, Chairman of the Soviet Peace Committee, delivered a report at the meeting. He gave a detailed account of the results of the World Peace Council meeting in Budapest. He said: The World Peace Council meeting passed a declaration for the settlement of international disputes through negotiation in a completely unified and warm atmosphere, and issued an appeal to the people of all countries, calling on them to "demand that their governments consult and reach agreements."

The people of all continents, regardless of party affiliation or social status, sincerely hope that consultation can firmly and unswervingly replace intimidation and blackmail, and that new armed conflicts will not occur. The global movement for consultation has unfolded widely in various forms in various countries. News from countries in Europe and Asia, and from countries in Latin America, proves that the masses have expressed the opinions put forward in the resolutions of the World Peace Council in various ways. The people of People's China and the people of various people's democratic countries wholeheartedly support the movement for consultation. Even in the United States, where the ruling group is pursuing a "cold war" policy and organizing international adventures and provocations, many people are willing to work with peace advocates in other countries to oppose aggression.

Now, the peace camp can see its definite achievements. The real and great victory of the cause of peace, and the practical result of the struggle of all peace-loving mankind, is the Korean armistice. It inspires peace fighters all over the world to engage in a more vigorous struggle for peace, and strengthens their confidence in achieving a peaceful settlement of all international disputes through consultation by the parties concerned.

The victory won by the heroic Korean people and the great Chinese people in defending peace in the Far East has promoted the overall victory of the cause of peace throughout the world.

Now, the people of all countries are full of hope and have full determination to continue the struggle for peace, because a situation has now been formed in which it would be a crime against humanity if the current partial relaxation of international tensions were allowed to give way again to black clouds containing thunder (the thunder of new threats to peace-loving and war-hating people). However, peace fighters are well aware that the enemies of peace, the forces of aggression, have not abandoned their vicious weapons. Imperialists and their lackeys are doing everything possible to undermine the favorable conditions that have been created for continuing to resolve the Korean issue through peaceful consultation. The provocation launched in the democratic sector of Berlin on June 17th this year was also organized by the same dark forces, which incited Syngman Rhee to issue his arrogant and rude statements, and which are searching everywhere in the world for excuses to worsen the international situation and launch wars and aggression.

Tikhonov then spoke about the efforts made by the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union in the struggle for peace. The Soviet people are vigilantly watching the development of the international situation and are using all methods to prevent another war and ensure and consolidate world peace. Tikhonov emphasized that the Soviet people warmly support the World Peace Council's resolution to resolve all international disputes through consultation, and resolutely condemn the policy of threatening with force. We demand that the countries concerned conduct sincere and open negotiations on all complex international disputes in order to establish lasting international peace. The people of the whole world are now demanding the start of such negotiations, such as negotiations on the Korean issue.

Like the people of other countries, the Soviet people hope that Korea will become a unified, free, and peaceful country, and that the Korean people will solve the problems of their national structure and the problems of their economic and cultural development themselves. This cannot be achieved under Syngman Rhee's oppression, sabotage, and tyrannical rule, because his rule is dragging Korea back to the dark ages of enslavement. Therefore, those who are making the upcoming Korean political conference subject to Syngman Rhee's control clearly have no sincerity in wanting a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. We, the Soviet people, have to resolutely condemn the policy adopted by the American delegation at a recent meeting of the United Nations General Assembly that endangers the cause of peace.

Similarly, the Soviet people cannot agree with the policy of ignoring such a large country as China when resolving important international issues. They cannot consider it justified that the United States government and the countries under its influence refuse to restore the People's Republic of China's violated rights in the United Nations Organization. This policy cannot bring useful results to the cause of peace.

The Soviet people unanimously support the proposals made by the Soviet government in its note to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France on August 15th this year regarding a peaceful settlement of the German issue. All Soviet people warmly support the results of the talks between the government of the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet government. We, the Soviet people, hope that Germany will become a democratic and unified country, and do not want it to be a terrible repeat of Hitlerism, nor a bloody American colony directed by foreigners.

The Soviet people also hope that Austria will become a free and peaceful country, and hope that Japan will break free from the shackles of the oppressors and become a democratic and peaceful country that can coexist peacefully with all countries.

The Soviet people hope to live in peace with all countries, because the Soviet people have no territorial ambitions towards any country. The Soviet people hope to live in friendship with the great American people. Despite the existence of the most insane reactionary groups in the United States, the American people, like all peace-loving people, have no animosity or hatred towards any other country.

The Soviet Union's unwavering policy is to consolidate peace and the security of all peoples. Starting from this policy, the Soviet people demand that agreements be reached on greatly reducing armaments, banning the use of atomic weapons, bacteriological weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction.

We will continue to expose the conspiracies of all forces that are hostile to peace and that organize provocative actions to obstruct the peaceful resolution of international problems. We will continue to oppose all those who attempt to undermine the peaceful resolution of international problems in order to launch wars. The Soviet people believe that the World Peace Council's resolution on launching a movement to resolve all international problems through consultation is very timely, and they are ready to actively support this resolution with practical actions.

After Tikhonov's report, the meeting held a warm discussion. The speakers at the discussion included: L. Solovyov, Secretary of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions; S. Gerasimov, Soviet People's Artist and film director; N. Popova, Chairman of the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee; writer B. Polevoi; Semichastny, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Soviet Leninist Young Communist League; composer D. Shostakovich; Academician A. Topchiev; Nikolai, Archbishop of Krutitsy and Kolomna; and the chairmen of the peace committees of Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Moldova, and other republics, as well as Leningrad and Stalingrad.

The plenary session unanimously passed a resolution on Tikhonov's report and decided to hold the Fifth All-Soviet Peace Congress in December this year.

    吉洪诺夫在苏联拥护和平委员会扩大全体会议上作报告
    苏联人民拥护大国协商解决争端
    【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联拥护和平委员会八月三十一日在莫斯科工会大厦十月大厅，举行扩大全体会议。参加会议的有苏联各加盟共和国、各边疆区和各州拥护和平委员会的代表，苏联工会、苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会、苏联妇女反法西斯委员会、苏联青年反法西斯委员会和其他公众团体的代表，以及科学家和文化工作者、工业和农业中的先进工作者、苏联各族人民争取和平斗争中的积极战士。
    全体会议由作家伊利亚·爱伦堡主持开幕。
    苏联拥护和平委员会主席尼古拉·吉洪诺夫在会上作了报告。他详细叙述了世界和平理事会布达佩斯会议的结果。他说：世界和平理事会会议在完全一致和热烈的气氛中通过了以争取协商的方式解决国际争端的宣言，并向世界各国人民发出呼吁书，号召他们“要求他们的政府进行协商并达成协议”。
    世界各洲的人民，不论是什么党派、什么社会地位，都衷心希望协商能够坚定地、毫无改变地代替恫吓和讹诈，希望新的武装冲突不再发生。世界范围争取协商的运动在各国以各种形式广泛地展开了。从欧洲和亚洲各国、从拉丁美洲各国所传来的消息证明，群众以各种方式表示了世界和平理事会决议中所提出的意见。人民中国和各人民民主国家的人民都全心全意地支持争取协商的运动。甚至在其统治集团正在奉行“冷战”政策、组织国际冒险和挑衅的美国，也有许多人民愿意和其他国家的和平拥护者共同努力反对侵略主义。
    现在，和平阵营可以看出它的肯定的成就了。和平事业的真正的、伟大的胜利，全体爱好和平人类的斗争的实际结果就是朝鲜停战。它鼓舞着全世界和平战士从事更加有力的争取和平的斗争，加强了他们对于通过有关方面以协商的方法达到和平解决一切国际争端的信心。
    英雄的朝鲜人民和伟大的中国人民在保卫远东的和平方面所获得的胜利，促进了全世界和平事业的总的胜利。
    现在，各国人民满怀着希望、有充分的决心要继续争取和平的斗争，因为现在已形成了一种局势，在这种局势下，如果使现已获得的国际紧张局势的某些缓和，再度让位给蕴藏着雷声（对热爱和平憎恨战争的人们的新威胁的雷声）的黑云的话，那末这就是对人类的一种罪行。然而，和平战士们十分清楚，和平的敌人、侵略的力量还没有抛弃他们的恶毒的武器。帝国主义者和他们的仆从正尽一切力量，企图破坏已经创造好了的继续以和平协商方式解决朝鲜问题的有利条件。今年六月十七日在柏林民主区所发动的挑衅也是由同一个黑暗势力所组织的，这个黑暗势力，怂恿李承晚发表他的傲慢无礼的声明，这个黑暗势力正在世界各处寻找使国际局势恶化和发动战争和侵略的藉口。
    吉洪诺夫接着谈到了苏联各族人民在争取和平中所作的努力，苏联人民正在警惕地注视着国际局势的发展，正在用一切方法防止另一次战争、保证和巩固世界和平。吉洪诺夫着重指出，苏联人民热烈地拥护世界和平理事会要求以协商方式解决一切国际争端的决议，坚决谴责以武力相威胁的政策。我们要求有关国家对一切复杂的国际争端进行诚恳的公开的谈判，以建立国际间的持久和平。全世界人民现在都要求开始这种谈判，例如关于朝鲜问题的谈判。
    苏联人民像其他国家的人民一样，都希望朝鲜成为一个统一、自由、和平的国家，希望由朝鲜人民自己解决他们国家结构的问题，解决他们经济和文化发展的问题。这在李承晚的压迫、破坏、暴虐的统治下是不能得到的，因为他这种统治正在把朝鲜拉回到黑暗的被奴役的年代里去。因此，那些正在使即将召开的朝鲜政治会议听任李承晚摆布的人们显然没有诚意想和平解决朝鲜问题。我们苏联人民不得不坚决地谴责美国代表团在最近召开的一次联合国大会会议上所采取的那种危害和平事业的政策。
    苏联人民同样地也不能同意在解决国际重要问题时忽视像中国这样大国的政策。他们不能认为美国政府以及在它影响之下的各国拒绝恢复中华人民共和国在联合国组织中被侵犯了的权利是正当的。这种政策不能替和平事业带来有用的结果。
    苏联人民一致拥护苏联政府在今年八月十五日致美国、英国和法国政府的照会中所提出的关于和平解决德国问题的建议。全体苏联人民热烈地拥护德意志民主共和国政府和苏联政府之间会谈的成果。我们苏联人民希望德国成为一个民主的、统一的国家，而不希望它成为可怕的希特勒主义的重演，也不要成为一个受外人指使而流血的美国殖民地。
    苏联人民也希望奥地利成为一个自由和平的国家，希望日本摆脱压迫者的枷锁，成为一个能和各国和平共处的、民主和平的国家。
    苏联人民希望和一切国家和平共处，因为苏联人民对于任何国家都没有领土的野心。苏联人民希望和伟大的美国人民友好相处。尽管美国有着最疯狂的反动集团，可是，美国人民和所有爱好和平的人民一样，对于任何其他国家并没有敌意和仇视。
    苏联坚持不变的政策是为了巩固和平与各国人民的安全，苏联人民从这种政策出发，要求在关于大大削减军备、禁止使用原子武器、细菌武器和其他大规模毁灭性的武器方面，取得协议。
    我们将不断揭露与和平为敌的一切力量的阴谋，它们组织挑衅行动来阻挠国际问题的和平解决。我们将继续反对一切为了发动战争而企图破坏国际问题的和平解决的人们。苏联人民认为世界和平理事会关于展开用协商办法解决一切国际问题的运动的决议非常适时，他们准备用实际行动来积极支持这个决议。
    吉洪诺夫报告后，会议就进行了热烈的讨论。在讨论会上发言的有：全苏工会中央理事会书记列·索洛维耶夫，苏联人民艺术家、电影导演谢·格拉西莫夫，苏联妇女反法西斯委员会主席尼·波波娃，作家鲍·波列沃伊，苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会书记谢米察斯特尼，作曲家德·萧斯塔科维奇，亚·托普切夫院士，克卢提柴和科罗姆纳的大主教尼古拉，以及乌克兰、哈萨克、摩尔达维亚等共和国和列宁格勒与斯大林格勒的拥护和平委员会主席等人。
    全体会议最后一致通过了关于吉洪诺夫报告的决议，并决定在今年十二月间举行第五届全苏拥护和平大会。
