Xinhua News Agency, Leipzig, August 31st: The 1953 Leipzig International Fair solemnly opened at the Leipzig Theater on August 30th. Ten thousand visitors from all over the German Democratic Republic, West Germany, and twenty-seven other countries attended the opening ceremony. Government leaders of the German Democratic Republic, delegations from the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and people's democratic countries, as well as diplomatic envoys from various countries to the German Democratic Republic, also attended the opening ceremony.

Grotewohl delivered a speech to the assembly. He pointed out that the normal development of international trade is of great significance for defending and consolidating peace throughout the world. He emphasized that the government of the German Democratic Republic, in accordance with its new policy, is striving to expand foreign trade relations and can play a major role in connecting trade between countries of the peaceful and democratic camp and all other countries, as long as such trade relations are built on the principles of mutual respect, equality, and national independence. Grotewohl also pointed out that the results of the negotiations recently conducted in Moscow between the delegation of the German Democratic Republic government and the Soviet government are of great significance for the further development of the German Democratic Republic's economy, for the national struggle of the entire German people to establish a unified, independent, democratic, and peace-loving Germany as soon as possible, and for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany.

Grotewohl read President Wilhelm Pieck's congratulatory message amidst warm applause. Afterwards, the guests visited the exhibition halls.

The exhibits of 8,000 state-owned and private enterprises in the German Democratic Republic reflected the initial achievements made by Democratic Germany in implementing the new policy of raising people's living standards. The consumer goods on display deeply impressed the audience.

The Soviet Pavilion was the most crowded pavilion on the first day of the exhibition. The exhibition vividly illustrated how the Soviet people are victoriously advancing in communist construction.

The Chinese Pavilion opened shortly after the opening of the fair. The first visitors after noon were Premier Grotewohl, Deputy Premiers Ulbricht, Rau, and Nuschke, and heads of diplomatic missions from various countries. Soviet High Commissioner to Germany, Ambassador Semenov, was also among the visitors.

Grotewohl wrote in the visitor's book, "Confidence, strength, peace, and the friendship of the people of all countries in the world peace camp guarantee the Chinese people's march towards socialism." Ulbricht wrote, "The exhibition shows the tremendous progress of the people's China's industry. I sincerely congratulate the Chinese people on their success in developing heavy industry."
