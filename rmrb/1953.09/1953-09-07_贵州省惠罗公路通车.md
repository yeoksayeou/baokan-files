Guizhou Province's Huiluo Highway Opens to Traffic
Xinhua News Agency

A highway from Huishui to Luodian has been built in the area where the Miao and Buyi peoples of southern Guizhou Province live. This highway was completely completed on July 10th of this year and has recently been officially opened to traffic.

This highway is 101 kilometers long and most of it was carved out of cliffs. The northern end is connected to the highway from Huishui to Guiyang and the highway trunk lines of the entire Guizhou Province. Most of the area on both sides is inhabited by Miao and Buyi people. In the past, transportation near Luodian County was blocked. The county's abundant tung oil, ramie, cowhide, cotton, timber, and vegetable and fruit products had to be transported to Guiyang and other areas by human or animal carriage. The salt, cloth, and daily necessities needed by the local people were both scarce and expensive. After the Huishui-Luodian highway opened to traffic, state-owned trading departments can transport large quantities of salt and general merchandise, and transport large quantities of tung oil, ramie, and timber. Recently, the price of salt in the two places has begun to fall due to reduced transportation costs.

The terrain in the area through which this highway passes is steep, making construction very difficult. As early as the end of the Guangxu period of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, the feudal dynasty planned to build a post road here. Later, Yuan Shikai and the Kuomintang reactionaries also wanted to build a highway here. But they were unable to overcome the natural barriers and failed. Beginning in November 1951, the People's Government led thousands of road construction workers and laborers, who, after twenty months of effort, overcame various difficulties and finally completed it, realizing the wishes of the people of all ethnic groups along the route.

### 贵州省惠罗公路通车

    贵州省惠罗公路通车
    贵州省南部苗族和布依族人民集居的地区修了一条从惠水到罗甸的公路，这条公路在今年七月十日全部修好后，最近已正式通车。
    这条公路长一百零一公里，大部分是从悬崖绝壁中开凿出来的，北端通过惠水到贵阳的公路和贵州全省的公路干线相连接。它的两旁大部分地区聚居着苗族和布依族人民。过去，罗甸县附近交通闭塞，该县盛产的桐油、青麻、牛皮、棉花、木材及蔬菜水果等物产，运送到贵阳及其他地区去都要靠人背或兽驮，而当地人民需要的食盐、布匹和日用百货是既少又贵。惠水到罗甸的公路通车后，国营贸易部门就可以运去大批食盐和百货，并大量地运出桐油、青麻和木材。最近，两地食盐的价格因运费减少，已开始降低了。
    这条公路所通过的地区地势陡削，修建起来很艰巨。早在满清光绪末年，封建王朝就打算在这里修一条驿道。后来，袁世凯和国民党反动派也想在这里修条公路。但都不能战胜天险，没有结果。一九五一年十一月开始，人民政府领导成千上万的筑路工人和民工，经过二十个月的努力，克服了各种困难，终于把它修好了，实现了沿线各族人民的愿望。（新华社）
