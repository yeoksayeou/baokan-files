    Victorious Heroes
    —An Interview with the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Representatives Returning Home for National Day Celebrations
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Zhou Zemin
    On the eve of the Fourth National Day, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's delegation of over one hundred representatives returning home for National Day celebrations, led by General Yang Dezhi, the commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and General Li Zhimin, the director of the Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, came to the capital of the great motherland, Beijing, from the Korean front, carrying the honor of victory and the lofty love and respect of all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army for the people of the motherland.
    The delegation includes representatives from various services and units, all outstanding commanders, fighters, political workers, and logistics personnel who have made brilliant contributions in the just struggle against aggression and in defense of peace. Among them are senior commanders from various services and units. Some of them participated in the five offensive operations from October 25, 1950, to late May 1951, personally commanding their units to drive the American aggressors from the Yalu and Tumen Rivers back to the south of the 38th parallel. From the Yalu River to the 38th parallel, this is the road they have traveled—a road to victory. Many of them led the soldiers day and night on the 250-kilometer-long front across Korea to construct deep defensive positions like walls of bronze and iron, firmly stabilizing the front near the 38th parallel, and in many victorious counterattacks, inflicted heavy losses on the enemy, pushing the front further and further south. Many of them participated in the famous defense of Kaesong, the Battle of Triangle Hill, and the powerful counterattacks west of the Bukhan River and south of Kumsong on the eve of the armistice, striking the enemy heavier and heavier blows each time. They grew and matured rapidly in battle, gradually becoming excellent commanders with high military skills and rich experience in commanding modern warfare. They and all the commanders at the front made significant contributions in the arduous struggle. They are the guarantee of victory.
    Another part of the delegation consists of heroes, models, and meritorious individuals from various services and units of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Among them is Zhao Renhu, the deputy regimental commander of a certain unit who led a battalion and inserted seven kilometers into the enemy's deep positions in two hours and forty minutes (north of Risil-dong) during the counterattack south of Kumsong. He commanded his unit, disrupted the enemy's deployment, annihilated the command structure of the 1st Regiment of the puppet Capital Division, cut off the enemy's retreat, annihilated more than 1,500 enemy soldiers in the enemy's heartland, and captured 31 artillery pieces and more than 50 vehicles, opening the way for our army's western assault forces. Also in the delegation is Yang Yucai, the deputy platoon leader of a reconnaissance platoon from a certain unit, who led a squad and directly attacked and defeated the headquarters of the so-called "White Tiger Regiment" of the puppet Capital Division with astonishing bravery and resourcefulness during the counterattack south of Kumsong. He led his troops in the area where the enemy regimental command post was located, killing or wounding more than 70 enemy soldiers, killing the commander of the puppet armored regiment reinforcing the "White Tiger Regiment," and capturing the "White Tiger Regiment's" regimental flag. The delegation also includes Lai Yongze, a squad leader from a certain unit who single-handedly repelled more than 20 counterattacks from an enemy force ranging from a squad to a battalion during the counterattack south of Kumsong; Li Guohai, the deputy squad leader of a certain unit who continuously blasted through three layers of enemy barbed wire, remained on the front line despite injuries, and single-handedly charged into the enemy's position, annihilating the enemy's company and platoon command posts and more than 50 enemy soldiers; Ren Zhimin, a platoon leader from a certain unit who led an assault platoon and annihilated 11 enemy bunkers and three tunnels, eliminating more than 40 enemy soldiers in 15 minutes; Gao Lianglun, a special-class meritorious individual and second-class combat hero who led a combat team and repelled 17 enemy assaults on two positions during the Battle of Triangle Hill, killing or wounding more than 300 enemy soldiers; Gao Runtian, a special-class meritorious individual and second-class hero who led two platoons and captured three enemy positions in one go during the Battle of White Horse Mountain, and repelled 15 counterattacks from an enemy force of a battalion on these positions, opening the way for our army's assault forces and killing or wounding more than 320 enemy soldiers; Lin Caizuo, a Korean soldier and first-class meritorious individual who remained on the front line despite injuries during the defense of Kaesong, killing or wounding more than 20 enemy soldiers and capturing many weapons; Jiang Daoping, a pilot from a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Air Force, a special-class meritorious individual and second-class hero who shot down five Sabre-type enemy aircraft and damaged two Sabre-type enemy aircraft in six air battles; Zhu Jinchi, an artillery observation platoon leader from a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, a special-class meritorious individual and second-class combat hero; Wang Xiangwen, a first-class meritorious individual and artillery commander who used a single gun to actively coordinate with the infantry, fought bravely for dozens of days and nights during the Battle of Triangle Hill, destroying more than 30 enemy bunkers of various sizes and killing a large number of enemy soldiers; Chen Youfu, a heroic truck driver on the transportation front who safely drove 60,800 kilometers, a special-class meritorious individual; Li Weibin, the deputy political instructor of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army tank forces, a first-class meritorious individual, who destroyed four enemy positions, destroyed one enemy tank, and killed or wounded a large number of enemies in a counterattack; Liu Changling, the deputy company commander of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army railway troops, a first-class meritorious individual and second-class hero; Zhang Chuanxin, a first-class meritorious individual from the engineering corps; Zhang Xianneng, an outstanding female literary soldier and member of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's cultural troupe, a second-class meritorious individual, who went deep into the front-line positions, carried out front-line literary work, and performed 99 performances in 28 days; and Zhu Yong, a female nurse who patiently served the wounded and sick, a second-class meritorious individual, and others. Some of them came from the front line of defense for peace—near the 38th parallel and the east and west coasts of Korea; some came from the logistics front and various work posts in Korea. They are all soldiers with a high degree of political awareness and noble qualities, and under the banner of justice, they have written brilliant poems in the history of the struggle to defend peace.
    The heroes returned to the capital of the motherland with the joy of victory. Nearly three years of arduous combat life have added wrinkles to the faces of many of them, and some have even developed gray hair. However, victory and honor were born in this arduous struggle. Most of the representatives have received medals, and some have received the title of hero. Many of them wear different medals, badges, and military service medals on their chests. Each medal, badge, and military service medal represents a merit or a series of merits. It is a symbol of victory and honor.
    But victory does not come easily; it is created by the heroes with blood, sweat, courage, and wisdom. Lai Yongze was the tip of the spear in a spearhead force of our army during the counterattack south of Kumsong in mid-July of this year. After inserting into the enemy's central position, Black Cloud Ridge, he engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy on the protruding position in front of Black Cloud Ridge. When his position was surrounded on three sides by the enemy who came to counterattack, and the ammunition was about to run out, he collected more than 70 boxes of grenades left behind by the fleeing enemy on the position and continued to strike the enemy. He was wounded in many places, but he did not leave the front line. Finally, when he had only two demolition charges left, he collected several piles of large stones, and when the enemy rushed close, he used the stones to hit the enemy. The enemy thought he was really out of ammunition, so they rushed up boldly and densely, and Lai Yongze took the opportunity to aim the demolition charges at the enemy pile and threw them in, killing a large number of enemies. In three days, Lai Yongze bravely cooperated with his comrades-in-arms and repelled the counterattacks of nearly a regiment of enemy troops in the enemy's heartland positions. In single-handedly defending the position, he killed more than 100 enemy soldiers. Air Force hero Jiang Daoping is only 23 years old this year, and he has only flown in jet fighters for a short time, but he has grown rapidly in battle. In his first battle, his plane was wounded, but he still calmly shot down an enemy plane. In the second battle, he used the sunlight to hide himself, took the opportunity to approach the enemy plane, and wounded the enemy plane. The third battle fully demonstrated Jiang Daoping's rapid improvement in shooting skills in battle. After entering a favorable position, he accurately fired a string of shells into the enemy plane's tail nozzle, blowing the enemy plane apart. After that, he bravely covered the leader plane in three more battles and shot down or damaged four enemy planes.
    With infinite remembrance and excitement, the heroes recounted the immortal deeds of the martyrs. Second-class hero Gao Lianglun will always remember the scene when Squad Leader Yang Guoliang, a second-class combat hero, sacrificed heroically. Yang Guoliang repelled an enemy force a hundred times his own while defending an outpost position in front of the 597.9 position. He insisted on staying on the front line despite being wounded in both arms. When two enemy platoons rushed up to the position and surrounded him densely, he stubbornly pulled open a demolition charge and rushed into the enemy crowd, blowing up a large number of enemies. Yang Guoliang also fell heroically. First-class meritorious individual Wu Zaiyuan also often remembers Zhou Chenglin, the squad leader of the Second Squad who sacrificed heroically like Yang Guoliang. In one battle, Zhou Chenglin's eyes were injured by enemy shells. When he heard the enemy coming up outside the fortifications again, he groped for a wooden stick, rushed out of the fortifications, and charged towards the enemy. The enemy did not have time to see what weapon he was holding, so they fled with their heads in their hands. But after a while, the enemy rushed up again and surrounded him. At this time, Zhou Chenglin fearlessly held a grenade and shouted: Long live our great motherland! Long live the Communist Party! Then he rushed towards the enemy and pulled the fuse. A large group of enemies fell beside him. Zhou Chenglin also shed his last drop of blood.
    In the days of victory, let us always remember them! It is they—the immortal martyrs—who have made the greatest contribution to the motherland and to peace.
    All the heroes who have returned to the motherland feel proud and comforted by the increasing prosperity of the great motherland. In Shenyang, many people went to the highest floor of their residence and stood there for a long time, watching the factories with chimneys standing tall and smoke billowing. It is these factories that have supplied them with so many valuable materials! Also in Shenyang, many people often went to department stores in groups of three or five. Some of them did not necessarily go to buy anything they needed, but to see the prosperity of the motherland. They said: "It is a blessing to see that the motherland has so many abundant materials, whatever you need, you have it."
    Heroic truck driver Peng Fengan, seeing the advancing motherland, kept repeating his wartime determination: Motherland, how lovely motherland! I will definitely guard you vigilantly, even if it costs my life.
    The heroes who fought for peace know the preciousness of peace, so they also know how to defend peace. When the representatives returned to the country, on the long front-line positions and beside the fortifications, the representatives heard the same voice everywhere: Tell the relatives of the motherland that we thank them, we will definitely be highly vigilant and strictly guard our positions, actively help the Korean people rebuild their homes, and fight to the end to powerfully defend the construction of the motherland and peacefully resolve the Korean issue. If the enemy dares to launch another war of aggression, then we will definitely make him suffer an even more serious defeat.
    Now, the motherland has seen this group of victorious heroes and warmly welcomes them. Because they are the honor and pride of our great motherland.

    胜利的英雄
    ——访中国人民志愿军国庆节归国观礼代表
    新华社记者　周泽民
    第四届国庆节前夕，中国人民志愿军国庆节归国观礼代表团一行一百多人，在团长、中国人民志愿军副司令员杨得志将军，副团长、中国人民志愿军政治部主任李志民将军率领下，带着胜利的荣誉，带着中国人民志愿军全体指挥员、战斗员对祖国人民的崇高的热爱和敬意，由朝鲜前线来到了伟大祖国的首都——北京。
    代表团中有各兵种、各部队来的代表，他们都是在反抗侵略、保卫和平的正义斗争中作出了光辉贡献的优秀的指挥员、战斗员、政治工作人员和后勤工作人员。其中包括各兵种、各部队的高级指挥员。他们有些人参加了一九五零年十月二十五日到一九五一年五月下旬进行的五次攻势作战，亲自指挥他们所领导的部队，把美国侵略军从鸭绿江和图们江边赶回到三八线以南。鸭绿江到三八线，这就是他们所走过的道路——一条胜利的道路。他们许多人曾夜以继日地领导战士们在横贯朝鲜的二百五十公里长的战线上，构筑了铜墙铁壁般的纵深的防御阵地，把战线坚固地稳定在三八线附近，并且在多次胜利的反击战中，使敌军遭受了严重的损失，把战线日益推向南方。他们中的许多人参加过著名的开城保卫战、上甘岭战役和停战前夕北汉江以西、金城以南的强大反击战，一次比一次沉重地打击了敌人。他们在战斗中迅速地成长和成熟起来，逐步地成为具有高度军事素养和指挥现代化战争的丰富经验的优秀指挥员。他们和前线所有的指挥员们，在艰苦的斗争中，作了重大的贡献。他们是胜利的保证。
    代表团中另一部分代表是中国人民志愿军各兵种、各部队的英雄、模范和功臣。其中有在金城以南反击战中带领一个营，以二小时四十分钟的时间，插进敌人纵深阵地七公里的（梨实洞以北地区）某部副团长赵仁虎。他指挥他的部队，打乱了敌人的部署，消灭了伪首都师第一团的指挥机构，并切断了敌人的退路，消灭了敌人的炮群，在敌人的心腹地区歼灭敌军一千五百多人，缴获了各种炮三十一门和五十多辆汽车，为我军西路攻击部队开辟了前进的道路。代表中还有在金城以南反击战中，带领一个班，首先直扑并打垮伪首都师所谓“白虎团”团部的某部侦察排副排长杨玉才，他以惊人的勇敢和机智，带领部队在敌人团指挥所的所在地，毙伤敌人七十多名，并打死了增援伪“白虎团”的伪机甲团团长，缴获了“白虎团”的团旗。代表中还有在金城以南反击战中独身打退敌人一个班到一个营的兵力的二十多次反扑的某部班长赖永泽；连续爆破敌人三道铁丝网，负伤不下火线，单身冲进敌人阵地，消灭了敌人连、排指挥所和五十多名敌人的某部副班长李国海；带领突击排，在十五分钟内消灭敌人十一个地堡和三条坑道，消灭敌人四十多名的某部排长任志民；在上甘岭战役中带领一个战斗小组，在两个阵地上击退敌人十七次冲锋，杀伤敌人三百多名的特等功臣、二级战斗英雄高良伦；在白马山反击战中，带领两个排，一气攻下敌人三个阵地，并在这些阵地上打退敌人一个营的兵力的十五次反扑，给我军冲锋部队打开了前进的道路，并杀伤敌人三百二十多名的特等功臣、二级英雄高润田；开城保卫战中，负伤不下火线，杀伤敌人二十多名，并缴获了许多武器的朝鲜族战士、一等功臣林菜左；有在六次空战中击落佩刀式敌机五架、击伤佩刀式敌机两架的中国人民志愿军空军某部飞行员、特等功臣、二级英雄蒋道平；有中国人民志愿军某部炮兵观测排长、特等功臣、二级战斗英雄朱金池；有在上甘岭战役中使用一门炮，积极配合步兵，奋战数十昼夜，摧毁敌人大小地堡三十多个，大量杀伤了敌人的一等功臣、炮长王祥文；有安全行车六万零八百公里的运输战线上的英雄汽车司机、特等功臣陈佑甫；有在一次反击战中摧毁敌人四个阵地，击毁敌人坦克一辆并杀伤了大批敌人的中国人民志愿军坦克部队某部副指导员、一等功臣李维斌；有中国人民志愿军铁道部队某部副连长、一等功臣、二级英雄刘长岭；工兵部队一等功臣张传新；有深入前沿阵地，开展火线文艺工作，二十八天中演出九十九场的出色的女文艺战士、中国人民志愿军某部文工队队员、二等功臣张贤能，和耐心为伤病员服务的女护士、二等功臣朱勇等。他们有的来自保卫和平的最前哨阵地——三八线附近和朝鲜的东、西海岸；有的来自朝鲜的后勤战线和各种工作岗位。他们都是具有高度的政治觉悟和高贵品质的战士，在正义的旗帜下，在保卫和平的斗争史上，写下了光辉灿烂的诗篇。
    英雄们带着胜利的喜悦回到祖国的首都。近三年艰辛的战斗生活，使他们许多人的脸上增添了绉纹，有些人的头上也出现了白发。但是，胜利和荣誉也就在这种艰辛的战斗中诞生了。代表中大部分人都受过勋，一部分人得到了英雄称号，他们许多人的胸前都佩着不同的勋章、奖章和军功章。每一枚勋章、奖章和军功章，都表示一件功绩或者一连串的功绩。它是胜利和荣誉的标志。
    但胜利不是轻易得来的，它是英雄们用血汗、勇敢和智慧缔造的。赖永泽在今年七月中旬金城以南反击战中是我军一支攻击部队中尖刀部队的刀尖。在插入敌人的中心阵地黑云吐岭后，他就在黑云吐岭前的突出阵地上和敌人展开了激烈的争夺战。当他所在的阵地受到前来反扑的敌人三面包围，弹药快打完的时候，他就在阵地上收集了敌人溃逃时丢下的七十多箱手榴弹，继续打击敌人。他身上多处负伤，但他不下火线。最后，当他只剩两根爆破筒时，他就收集了几堆大石块，等到敌人冲近时，他就用石块打敌人。敌人以为他真的弹药完了，就放心大胆，密密麻麻地涌上来，赖永泽乘机将爆破筒对准敌人堆里投去，炸死了一大片敌人。三天中，赖永泽就这样英勇地配合他的战友，在敌人的心腹阵地上打退了敌人将近一个团的兵力的反扑。在独身坚守阵地中，他打死敌人一百多名。空军英雄蒋道平，今年才二十三岁，在喷气式战斗机上飞行的时间也很短，但他在战斗里迅速地成长起来。在第一次战斗中，他的飞机负了伤，但他仍镇静地击落了一架敌机。第二次战斗，他利用阳光隐蔽自己，乘机接近了敌机，并击伤了敌机。第三次战斗充分显示出蒋道平在战斗中飞速提高了射击技术，他在进入有利位置后，把一串炮弹准确地从敌机的尾喷口里打了进去，打得敌机腹中开花，四分五裂。此后，他又在三次战斗中，英勇地掩护了长机，并击落击伤了四架敌机。
    英雄们怀着无限怀念和激动的心情叙述了烈士们的不朽业迹。二级英雄高良伦永远记住九班长、二级战斗英雄杨国良壮烈牺牲时的情形。杨国良在坚守五九七·九阵地前面的一个前哨阵地中，打退了百倍于己的敌人，两臂负伤坚持不下火线，当敌人两个排扑上阵地，并密密层层地包围了他时，他顽强地拉开爆破筒，冲进敌人群里，炸死了一大片敌人，杨国良也壮烈的倒下了。一等功臣武在元也常怀念着和杨国良一样壮烈牺牲的二班长周成林。一次战斗中，周成林双眼被敌人的炮弹炸伤，当他听到工事外面敌人又上来时，摸到一根木棒，便窜出工事，冲向敌人，敌人来不及看清他拿的是什么武器，便抱头逃窜了。但一会儿，敌人又冲了上来，并包围了他。这时，周成林怀抱手雷无畏地高呼：我们伟大的祖国万岁！共产党万岁！然后冲向敌人，拉响导火索，一大群敌人倒在他的身旁。周成林也流尽了他最后的一滴血。
    在胜利的日子里，让我们永远记住他们吧！正是他们——永垂不朽的烈士们，为祖国、为和平作了最大的贡献。
    所有回到祖国的英雄们，都为伟大祖国的日益富强感到骄傲和安慰。在沈阳，许多人走上他们住所的最高一层楼房，久久的伫立在那里，注视着烟囱林立、浓烟滚滚的工厂区。就是这些工厂，曾供给他们多少可贵的物资啊！也就在沈阳，许多人常常三五成群地走进百货公司，他们有些人并不一定是去买什么需要的东西，而是去看祖国的繁荣。他们说：“看到祖国有那么多丰富的物资，要什么，有什么，真是一种幸福。”
    英雄汽车司机彭逢恩，看到前进中的祖国，不断重复地说着他战时的决心：祖国，多么可爱的祖国啊！我一定警惕地保卫着你，那怕牺牲我的生命。
    为和平而战的英雄们是知道和平的可贵的，因此，他们也就懂得怎样来保卫和平。当代表们返国时，在漫长的前线阵地上、工事旁，代表们到处听到同一个声音：告诉祖国的亲人们，我们感谢他们，我们一定高度警惕地严守自己的阵地，积极地帮助朝鲜人民重建家园，为有力地保卫祖国建设，和平解决朝鲜问题而斗争到底。如果敌人胆敢再次发动侵略战争，那么，我们一定叫他遭到更加严重的失败。
    现在，祖国看见了这批胜利的英雄，并热情地欢迎了他们。因为他们是我们伟大祖国的荣誉和骄傲。
