    Use Practical and Concrete Methods to Help Primary School Graduates
    Yu Jingzhen, Principal of No. 1 Primary School, District 1, Tianjin

    After the release of the unified enrollment results for junior middle schools in Tianjin, some of our school's teachers said, "Oh! What should we do with so many students who didn't pass the exam?" Students who failed the exam returned to school and asked the principal and teachers, "What should we do? We didn't pass!" Some students, seeing their names were not on the list, went home and cried incessantly; others didn't dare to come to school, fearing ridicule. Some parents of students who didn't pass also couldn't understand the situation. Everyone felt at a loss and couldn't think of a proper solution. As a principal, my understanding of this problem was also somewhat vague at the time. I failed to provide the necessary and possible ideological preparation for students who couldn't pass the exam from all aspects. Although I did some work of persuasion and explanation in principle, I couldn't find concrete solutions in my mind, and the persuasive power of the explanation was not strong.

    After reading the "People's Daily" editorial on "Solving the Problem of Primary School Graduates Entering Higher Education in a Realistic Manner," I first felt deeply that the Party and the government's concern for the people's education was meticulous. It not only pointed out the nature of this problem and the reasons for its occurrence but also comprehensively proposed concrete methods for working together to solve the problem based on the principle of necessity and possibility being consistent. At this time, I felt enlightened, and felt that the Party and the government's instruction not only cared about students, helped parents and teachers, but also educated and enlightened education cadres, enabling us to mobilize the potential of all aspects with full confidence to jointly solve this problem. After reading the editorial, I made the following preliminary preparations: First, I asked the teachers whether they had read the "People's Daily" editorial and listened to their feelings after reading it. Some said, "There is a way to solve the problem this time." Some said, "It really shows that the government cares about our second generation and tries every means to help us solve the problem." Teacher Hao said, "The government is highly responsible to the people." Then, we arranged for the teachers to study further, asking everyone to be educated by this editorial and related documents, and to learn to handle affairs according to the principle of necessity and possibility being consistent, and to have the courage and confidence to overcome difficulties and solve problems.

    In the past few days, students who failed the exam have been coming to school constantly, and their emotions have changed significantly compared to before. Every child's eyes are filled with joy and hope. Some said, "We read the newspaper and we will take the second exam!" The teachers also introduced to the students the progress and joy in work of a female student who graduated from our school the year before last after participating in factory work, which encouraged several older students to actively ask the teachers where they could be introduced to factories to participate in labor. We have organized all the students who did not pass the exam to review their lessons, and the teachers and students are very active. And it can also be seen that everyone is full of confidence in solving this problem. We also visited several parents. Some said, "I thought the government would find a way, and it really did!" Some are determined to send their children back to school for another year, and now they are generally urging their children to review their lessons. We will also convene a parents' forum to listen to opinions and further explain the spirit of the "People's Daily" editorial. Parents are also required to prepare ideologically while helping their children review their lessons, so that if they cannot pass the exam again, they can adopt other practical and concrete solutions to properly arrange their children's future. We have also made various preparations for the second exam, and are preparing to take back some students to study for another year. (Originally published in Tianjin Daily on September 7th)

### 用切实具体的办法帮助小学毕业生

    用切实具体的办法帮助小学毕业生
    天津市一区第一小学校长  于静贞
    天津市初级中学统一招生发榜后，我们学校有的老师说：“呀！这么多学生没考上怎么办呢？”落榜的同学回到学校，找校长和老师说：“怎么办？我们没考上！”有的同学看榜上没有自己的名子，回家就一个劲儿的哭；有的就不敢到学校来，怕人笑话。有的没考上的学生的家长也想不通这个问题。大家都感到茫然，想不出妥善办法。作为一个校长的我，当时对这个问题的认识也比较模糊。我对于不能考取的学生没能从各方面作必要的与可能的思想准备。虽然也做了某些原则上的说服解释工作，但思想中也找不出解决问题的具体办法，解释工作虽然做了，但说服力不大。
    我读到“人民日报”关于“实事求是地解决小学毕业生升学问题”的社论以后，首先亲切地感到党和政府关心人民的教育事业是无微不至的。它不仅指出了这个问题的性质和发生的原因，并且全面地提出共同努力根据必要与可能一致的原则来解决问题的具体办法。这时我心里开朗了，感到党与政府这一指示，不但关心学生，帮助了家长和教师，也教育和启发了教育干部，使我们能以满怀信心地发动各方面的潜力共同努力解决这一问题。我读过社论以后，就初步作了以下几件准备工作：首先问老师们是否读过“人民日报”社论，并分别倾听他们的读后感想。有的说：“解决问题，这回可有办法了。”有的说：“真正看出政府是关心我们的第二代的，想尽一切办法来帮助我们解决问题。”郝老师说：“政府对人民真是高度负责的。”接着，我们又布置老师们再深入学习，要求大家在这一篇社论及有关文件中受到教育，并学习根据必要与可能一致的原则来办事，应有克服困难和解决问题的勇气与信心。
    这几天来，没考上的学生不断到学校来，情绪比以前有显著的变化，每个孩子的眼睛里充满了喜悦与希望。有的说：“我们看了报纸，要考第二次了！”老师们还给学生介绍我校一位前年毕业的女生参加工厂工作以后在工作上的进步和欢欣愉快的情形，这样就鼓舞了几个年岁较大的学生主动地找老师们打听哪里可以介绍到工厂去参加劳动。我们已经把没考上的同学都组织起来进行温课，老师和学生们都很积极。而且也看出大家对解决这一问题都是满怀着信心的。我们也访问了几个家长。有的说：“我早就想政府会给想办法的，果然有了！”有的打定主意要把孩子送回学校再念一年，现在都普遍督促孩子温课。我们还要召集一次家长座谈会听取意见，并将“人民日报”社论的精神再进行解释。也要求家长们在帮助孩子温课的同时要作思想准备，以便再不能考取时采用其他实际解决问题的具体办法来妥善地安排自己孩子的前途。我们对迎接第二次考试也作了各种准备工作，并准备收回一部分学生再读一年。    （原载九月七日天津日报）
