    Tian Guiying in Study
    Xing Qingquan
      On December 9, 1951, more than 80 labor models and advanced producers from Northeast China entered the former Northeast Experimental Workers and Peasants' Rapid Course Middle School—now the Workers and Peasants' Rapid Course Middle School attached to the Northeast Institute of Technology. Tian Guiying, China's first female train driver and national railway labor model, entered the Workers and Peasants' Rapid Course Middle School at this time.
    Formal cultural learning was a new thing for her. She lived a poor life in the old society, fishing at sea with her father all day long, and had no opportunity to learn culture.
    She had only studied for two years or so in the past. In the entrance examination, she only knew simple addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in arithmetic, and did not understand fractions or decimals at all; there were many typos in the Chinese test paper. Precisely because of her low level of education, she once asked to study in a remedial class when she was assigned to a class upon admission, but when the organization asked her to try it out, she made up her mind: "I must catch up."
    In the classroom, she listened attentively, and no external force could interrupt her thinking. In her own words, she didn't miss a single word the teacher said. This was the case in class, and it was the same after class. When doing exercises in self-study in the evening, she actively exerted her independent thinking ability. After the teacher finished correcting the homework, she would carefully look at it and carefully check the shortcomings in the homework. When summarizing her geometry learning experience, she said: "When doing homework in the evening, I don't easily ask others how to do it. No matter how difficult the questions the teacher gives, I always try to solve them, so that I can turn knowledge into my own and make the knowledge I have learned more solid. I carefully look at the homework that the teacher has corrected every time, and think about why the teacher wants to correct it for me like this...".
    Tian Guiying's learning attitude is correct. No matter which subject it is, she always has an attitude of understanding what she understands and not understanding what she doesn't understand. In the classroom, if she has any doubts, she immediately raises them and asks, and thoroughly clarifies the problem. It is also the same when studying problems with classmates after class. Knowing is knowing, and not knowing is not knowing. She is never complacent, and often humbly checks her shortcomings in learning, and actively seeks the opinions of teachers. For example, when she first learned geometry, she was not bold enough. After the teacher pointed out this shortcoming, she quickly corrected it.
    She never favors one subject over another in her studies. She said: "The courses prescribed by the school are useful to me and are very important." Therefore, she adopts a serious, down-to-earth, and realistic attitude towards all courses.
    Her grades are excellent. Judging from her current grades, most of the nine courses are five points (only one or two courses are four points), making her one of the excellent students in the class. Her progress in Chinese is even more significant. Her writing has now basically reached a smooth level, and the structure is tight and the levels are clear; she has consistently maintained a score of five points in the forty or so compositions from admission to the present.
    Her progress in mathematics learning is also very rapid. When she first entered school, she only knew simple addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division problems, but due to her hard work, algebra and geometry have now reached a level of five points. When she performs algebra, she is not only fast, but also able to explain the reasoning. In geometry learning, she can flexibly use theorems and think quickly, just as she said herself: "Sometimes I understand before the teacher has even explained the answer to the exercise."
    She also learns physics, chemistry, history, and geography very well. Therefore, she now feels relaxed and happy in her studies.

    学习中的田桂英
    邢清泉
      一九五一年十二月九日，东北地区有八十几名劳动模范和先进生产者进了原东北实验工农速成中学——现东北工学院附设的工农速成中学。中国第一名女火车司机、全国铁路劳动模范田桂英就是在这个时候走进工农速成中学的。
    正规的文化学习对她说来是件新事儿。她在旧社会里过着贫苦生活，终日跟父亲在海上打鱼，得不到文化学习的机会。
    她过去只念过二年多书，入学考试时她算术只会简单的加减乘除，分数、小数一点也不懂；语文试卷中错别字很多。正因为她文化程度低，在入学编班时，她曾要求到补习班去学习，但当组织方面叫她试试看时，她就下定了决心：“我一定要赶上去。”
    在课堂上她全神贯注地听讲，没有任何外力可以打断她的思考。用她自己的话来讲，就是：不漏掉老师所讲的每一句话。上课是如此，下课也是如此。在晚上自习作习题时，她积极地发挥自己的独立思考能力。教师批完作业之后，她又是那样细心地看，认真地检查作业中的缺点。她在总结几何学习经验时说：“在晚间做作业时，我不轻易问别人怎样作。老师出的题不论怎样难，我总要设法把它解答出来，这样才能把知识变成自己的，使所学得的知识更为巩固。老师批改的作业，我每次都细心地看，想想老师为什么要给我这样改……”。
    田桂英的学习态度是正确的。不论对那一门功课，她总是抱着懂就懂、不懂就不懂的态度。在课堂上，有一点儿疑问她马上就提出来问，把问题彻底弄明白。在课后和同学研究问题时，也是如此，知道就是知道，不知道就是不知道。她从来也不自满，经常虚心地检查自己在学习中的缺点，主动地征求老师们的意见。如刚学几何时她不够大胆，经教师指出这一缺点以后，她就迅速地改正了。
    她在学习上从来不偏重那一科。她说：“学校所规定的各门功课对我都是有用的，都很重要。”因此她对各门功课都采取认真踏实、实事求是的态度。
    她的成绩是优秀的。从现在的成绩来看，九门课程中绝大部分都是五分（仅一两门课程是四分），成为班内优秀学生之一。她的语文成绩的进步更为显著，作文现在已经基本上达到通顺水平，而且结构紧密，层次清楚；从入学到现在的四十几次作文中，一贯保持五分。
    她在数学学习上的进步也是很快的。刚入学时她仅会简单的加减乘除题，但由于她的努力钻研，现在代数、几何都已经达到了五分的水平。她在演算代数时，不仅迅速，而且能讲出道理来。在几何学习上，她能灵活地运用定理，思考也迅速，正如她自己所说的：“有时老师还没有把习题的答案讲出来，我就明白了。”
    她在物理、化学、历史、地理等方面，也学得都很好。因此她现在在学习上觉得轻松愉快。
