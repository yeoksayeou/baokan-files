Xinhua News Agency, 12th: The 24th meeting of the Central People's Government Committee was held in an enlarged session on the afternoon of the 12th. The meeting heard the report made by Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, on the work of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in Resisting America and Aiding Korea (full text to be published separately). After speeches by Committee members Zhang Zhizhong, Fu Zuoyi, Chen Jiageng, Vice Chairman Li Jishen, and Committee member Chen Shutong, the meeting unanimously approved a letter of condolence to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

Zhang Zhizhong said: The greatest victory of Resist America and Aid Korea is that we pushed back the American imperialist invading army from the Yalu River to the 38th parallel, ensured the survival of the Korean people, safeguarded the security of the motherland, guaranteed peace in the Far East and the world, and postponed the timetable for American imperialist aggression against the world. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army has been greatly strengthened after nearly three years of training and is fully capable of defeating any new provocations together with the Korean People's Army. Fu Zuoyi said: The victory of the Resist America and Aid Korea struggle is not only a victory on the Korean front, but also a victory for all aspects of our country's work. Our national defense has been further consolidated because of the victory of the Resist America and Aid Korea struggle, and our international status has also been enhanced because of this victory.

Chen Jiageng said: The great victory of Resist America and Aid Korea has filled overseas Chinese with confidence and inspired them with infinite courage. The achievement of this victory is inseparable from the support of our great ally, the Soviet Union, and peace-loving people all over the world.

Vice Chairman Li Jishen said: The victory of the Resist America and Aid Korea war proves that the Chinese and Korean people cannot be bullied and that the aggressors' attacks can be repelled. In the future, the people of the whole country must continue to be vigilant against the enemy's conspiracies to launch aggression and continue to strengthen our national defense forces.

Chen Shutong said: The victory of the Resist America and Aid Korea war has made us deeply realize that only by resisting aggression can we achieve peace and carry out large-scale economic construction. Now our victory has forced the enemy to cease fire, but the American aggressors are not reconciled to defeat. Therefore, we should remain vigilant and continue to support the Korean people, defend the security of the motherland and peace in the Far East.
