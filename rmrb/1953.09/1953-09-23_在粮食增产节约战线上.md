A Review of Newspaper Work

On the Grain Increase and Conservation Front

Our country's grain output has exceeded the highest level before the Anti-Japanese War. However, with the development of national economic construction, the demand for grain is constantly increasing. We must increase grain production even more to meet the needs of the country and the people. Currently, crops are already ripe or about to ripen. An important part of increasing grain production and conserving grain is that "in some drought-stricken areas in the south, wherever possible, we should organize the masses to rush-plant and replant late-autumn crops; in some waterlogged areas in the north, we must organize the masses to drain water and save crops. All areas must provide good leadership for autumn harvesting and autumn planting, and do everything possible to increase the harvest of grain and other crops." (September 6th People’s Daily editorial). To do everything possible to increase the harvest of grain and other crops, party and government leading organs in various regions have, since June, successively adopted all effective measures according to local conditions and possibilities, and mobilized the masses to strive vigorously. Newspapers in some regions, under the leadership of the Party committees, have also conducted relatively strong publicity on how to increase the harvest of grain and other crops as much as possible, according to the characteristics of different regions.

Taking Hubei Daily and Ningbo Masses Daily as examples, the former has made relatively prominent publicity on rushing to plant and replant late-autumn crops to strive for an extra season, and the latter has made relatively prominent publicity on increasing the production of coarse grains to strive for an all-round bumper harvest. The characteristics of the two newspapers in publicity are roughly the same.

To increase the harvest of grain and other crops as much as possible, we must adopt various effective methods according to local conditions and possibilities. The first common point of Hubei Daily and Ningbo Masses Daily in publicity is to carry out different key reports according to the characteristics of different regions. Hubei Daily has carried out a series of reports on increasing grain production from the aspects of rushing to harvest and plant, selecting seeds and accumulating fertilizer, and planting wheat. In the middle rice harvesting area, the newspaper focused on mobilizing the masses to "strive for the last meal of water to ensure a comprehensive bumper harvest of rice"; in areas where rice suffers from white spikes and lodging, the newspaper focused on mobilizing the masses to rush to plant late rice or other late-autumn crops, striving to "harvest this if we can't harvest that." While reporting on rushing to harvest and plant, the newspaper also reported on the use of all leisure land to plant green manure, and the preparation work for selecting seeds and planting wheat, in order to strive for a bumper wheat harvest next year. Similarly, Ningbo Masses Daily also focused on preventing rice lodging in rice areas according to the characteristics of different regions; focused on thinning seedlings and protecting seedlings to strive for full seedlings in cotton areas; and focused on coarse grain production in mountainous areas. Around these different key points, the two newspapers also provided different technical guidance on how to increase the harvest of crops through lively people and events. Hubei Daily introduced how Luo Wenxing, a farmer in Chunhe Township, Wuchang, planted buckwheat, and how the Zhangmen Mutual Aid Group in Mugang Township, Yangxin, specifically arranged the rushing to harvest, plant, and autumn cultivation on August 12th, 14th, 16th, 20th, and 23rd respectively; Ningbo Masses Daily introduced the high-yield experience of coarse grain crops such as barley, pumpkin, and corn on June 16th, 18th, and 23rd. These experiences of trying to increase crop harvests from all aspects are mostly based on the production experience of the local masses over the years. Therefore, once these different experiences are promoted by the newspapers, they can enlighten the masses in various different regions and be widely adopted to jointly strive for increased production. At the same time, in terms of newspapers, the publicity method of adapting to local conditions avoids impetuosity and truly implements the policy of increasing grain production.

Of course, guiding and mobilizing the masses to rush to plant and replant late-autumn crops or increase the production of coarse grains according to the characteristics of different regions and the techniques of different crops is still only one aspect of the newspaper's efforts to adopt all effective measures to mobilize the masses to increase grain harvests. Another aspect, and also the most basic aspect, is to discover and solve various ideological problems in the struggle to strive to increase the harvest of grain and other crops, to use advanced ideological education to transform backward conservative ideas, and to promote the progress of work. The second common point of Hubei Daily and Ningbo Masses Daily is that they have revealed and solved various complex ideological problems in this aspect through lively people and events. In the reports on August 26th, 27th, and 30th, Hubei Daily revealed the erroneous ideas of some farmers who believed that planting late-autumn crops "is not worth the effort," "whatever we get is what we get," and "more grain production means more grain delivery." In response to these backward conservative ideas, the reports used some advanced figures, advanced ideas, and advanced facts as examples, explaining the vital interests of increasing crop harvests for farmers from the aspects of "one bucket of autumn harvest is equal to one stone of spring harvest," "increased production does not increase taxes," and planting buckwheat does not affect wheat planting and can increase income (at least 180 to 190 catties per mu, and up to 300 catties). This has encouraged the enthusiasm of farmers to produce to a certain extent, and thus expanded the planting area of late-autumn crops. According to incomplete statistics in Echeng, the buckwheat planting area has expanded by 40,000 mu compared to last year, and the area of rice ratooning has more than doubled compared to last year. In the publicity for increasing crop harvests, Ningbo Masses Daily also conducted a relatively profound criticism of the one-sided views of "emphasizing plains and neglecting mountainous areas," "emphasizing fine grains and neglecting coarse grains," and "emphasizing cash crops and neglecting coarse grain production" existing among local rural cadres, as well as the phenomenon that some cadres believe that "cotton areas are more popular than rice areas" and "fine grains are more popular than coarse grains," resulting in uneasiness in working in mountainous areas, using various forms. For example, a reader's letter on June 16th criticized "some cadres in Cixi County still have the one-sided view of 'neglecting mountainous areas and neglecting coarse grains'." Shortly after this letter was published, the "Friends of Rural Work Cadres" supplement of the newspaper published a review by Comrade Xiang Geng, Secretary of the Cixi County Party Committee. In this review, Comrade Xiang Geng analyzed and criticized the one-sided view of "neglecting coarse grains" and its bad consequences on cadres and the masses, based on proportional figures and specific facts, starting from checking the leadership responsibilities of the county party committee and himself, and pointed out the importance of strengthening coarse grain production and establishing a comprehensive bumper harvest view. For example, in the report "'This year's wheat harvest is good, worth a season of rice!' Farmers tell me that we should have a comprehensive bumper harvest view" on June 12th, the newspaper used the example of a township cadre realizing the actual benefits gained by farmers in mountainous areas in coarse grain production after specific calculations to educate cadres and the masses to value coarse grain production. While carrying out ideological criticism, the newspaper also explained the position of coarse grain production in people's economic life and the relationship between strengthening coarse grain production and comprehensively improving agricultural production and national industrial construction in the form of questions and answers and short comments. In agricultural production publicity, it is also an issue that cannot be ignored to promptly point out its political significance, point out its relationship with industrial production, and thus encourage farmers' patriotic enthusiasm for increasing production.

What cannot be ignored even more is that while striving to increase the harvest of grain and other crops, it is also necessary to mobilize farmers to pay attention to conserving grain. Paying attention to conserving grain is not only to prevent and overcome the possible waste after a bumper harvest, but also to encourage and develop farmers' enthusiasm for expanding production investment and increasing production, and to strive for greater increased production and bumper harvest in the coming year. Hubei Daily simultaneously implemented the Party's policy in the publicity of increasing grain production. On the one hand, Hubei Daily praised the farmers of Jinzhai Township, Xingyang No. 1 District, for actively investing the remaining grain into production after reducing and exempting public grain, striving to produce more grain next year in the report on September 7th; on the other hand, the "Letter Review," "Rural Work Review," and "Letter Summary" on August 19th, 23rd, and September 7th continuously criticized and educated some farmers on the serious waste of grain caused by the early autumn harvest. According to reports from many readers of the newspaper, 93 out of 105 farmers in Zhangjia Township, Sixth District, Gong'an County, were burning grain to make liquor; Chen Xiping's distillery in Hepu Township, Daye, burned 45 stone of grain to make liquor in two days. The result of extravagance and waste has added new difficulties to some farmers in production and life. When criticizing these phenomena of wasting grain, Hubei Daily first affirmed that after a bumper harvest, it is also right for farmers to appropriately improve their lives and do some cultural entertainment; however, whether it is eating and drinking, performing operas, or holding weddings and funerals, there should be a limit, and it should not cause difficulties in production and life. Secondly, the newspaper also focused on criticizing the erroneous ideas such as "it doesn't matter if you spend more, anyway, you can rely on the people's government in the future," "you've worked hard, spend more, just think of it as losing a little," and "it doesn't matter if you eat more, just think of it as using it for drought resistance," and the bad habit of "eat for a season, whether there is a harvest or not." In order to correctly and patiently educate farmers to change these wrong ideas and bad habits, Hubei Daily proposed to use self-education methods such as recollection and comparison, detailed accounting, to conduct policy education, future education, and ideological education of increasing production and conserving, working diligently to get rich, and loving the country to develop the family, so as to make farmers develop a new atmosphere of increasing production and conserving. Hubei Daily's practice of being able to promptly discover, criticize, and point out solutions to this phenomenon of wasting grain that has just emerged in rural areas is undoubtedly worthy of promotion. Therefore, it is also an important responsibility of the newspaper to patiently educate farmers on conserving grain at the same time.

Of course, the reason why Hubei Daily and other newspapers have done a relatively good job in this publicity is inseparable from the local party and government leading organs' attention to this work. For example, the Hubei Provincial People's Government and the Department of Agriculture and Forestry successively issued instructions on planting and cultivating late-autumn crops, instructions on vigorously leading the autumn harvest, and notices on vigorously accumulating fertilizer and expanding the planting area of green manure in combination with the autumn harvest and autumn planting on August 2nd, 9th, and 26th. In addition, the newspaper also published an editorial on September 3rd entitled "Continue to Lead the Masses, Vigorously Plant Late-Autumn Crops, Do a Good Job in Wheat Planting Preparation, and Strive for a Greater Bumper Harvest." These instructions or editorials representing the opinions of local party and government leading organs gave the newspaper a great inspiration in reporting ideas and a great force in publicity and mobilization.

Now the autumn harvest has already begun or is about to begin in various regions. In the grain increase and conservation front, in addition to seizing the time, adapting to local conditions, vigorously mobilizing the masses to plant late-autumn crops, actively draining water to prevent floods, cultivating autumn and planting wheat, conserving grain and investing in production, and striving for a bumper harvest next year, newspapers in various regions should also firmly grasp the spirit of increasing production and conserving grain, pay attention to reporting typical examples of frost prevention and production protection, careful harvesting and threshing, clean ground and bright fields, returning grains to homes, and the achievements and harvests of sideline production with raw materials and sales channels. If these tasks are done well, they will also be of great help in increasing the harvest of grain and increasing farmers' income.

    在粮食增产节约战线上
    我国粮食产量已超过抗日战争以前最高水平，但是随着国家经济建设的发展，粮食需要量也就不断增加；必须增产更多的粮食，才能满足国家和人民的需要。目前农作物已经成熟，或即将成熟，增产粮食和节约粮食的一个重要环节，就是“在南方某些旱灾地区，凡有可能时即应组织群众抢种、补种晚秋作物；在北方某些水涝地区，要组织群众排除积水，抢救庄稼。各地都要很好地领导秋收、秋种工作，尽一切可能提高粮食和其他农作物的收获量。”（九月六日本报社论）为尽一切可能提高粮食和其他农作物的收获量，各地党政领导机关从六月以来，已先后根据当地具体情况及可能条件，因地制宜采取一切有效措施并动员群众大力争取。若干地区的报纸在党委的领导下，也根据不同地区的特点，对于如何尽一切可能提高粮食和其他农作物的收获量，都作了比较有力的宣传。
    以湖北日报、宁波大众报为例，前者曾对抢种补种晚秋作物、争取多收一季，后者曾对增加杂粮生产、争取全面丰产，作了比较突出的宣传。该两报在宣传上的特点，大体上是相同的。
    要尽一切可能提高粮食和其他农作物的收获量，必须根据当地具体情况及可能条件，因地制宜采取各种有效办法。湖北日报、宁波大众报在宣传上所表现的第一个共同之点，就是根据不同地区的特点进行不同重点的报道。湖北日报从抢收抢种、选种积肥、种麦等各方面进行了一系列的增产粮食的报道。在中稻收割地区，该报着重动员群众
  “努力争取最后一餐水，保证水稻全面丰收”；在稻谷发生白穗和倒伏地区，着重动员群众抢种晚秧或其他晚秋作物，争取“不收那头收这头”。在报道抢收、抢种同时，该报还报道了利用一切休闲地种植绿肥，和选种、种麦等准备工作，以争取明年小麦丰收。同样，宁波大众报也根据不同地区的特点，对稻区着重报道了防止稻倒伏；对棉区着重报道了间苗保苗，争取全苗；对山区着重报道了杂粮生产。环绕这些不同的重点，两个报还通过活人活事在如何提高农作物收获量的方法上，作了不同的技术指导。湖北日报在八月十二日、十四日、十六日、二十日、二十三日曾分别介绍了武昌春和乡农民罗文兴怎样种荞麦、阳新木港乡章门互助组怎样具体安排抢收抢种秋耕工作等等经验；宁波大众报在六月十六日、十八日、二十三日则介绍了大麦、南瓜、玉米等杂粮作物的高额丰产经验。这些从各方面尽力提高农作物收获量的经验，大都是根据当地群众自己多年的生产经验研究提高的。因而这些不同经验，一经报纸推广，就能对各种不同地区的群众有所启发，并被广泛采用，共同为争取增产而努力。同时，在报纸方面，由于掌握了因地制宜的宣传方法，既避免了急躁冒进，又切实地贯彻了增产粮食的方针。
    当然，根据不同地区的特点和不同作物的技术，来指导和动员群众抢种补种晚秋作物或增加杂粮生产，仍仅仅是报纸采取一切有效措施动员群众增加粮食收获量的一个方面。另一个方面，也是最基本的一方面，则是发现和解决在争取提高粮食和其他农作物收获量的斗争中各种思想问题，以先进的思想教育改造落后的保守思想，并推动工作前进。湖北日报、宁波大众报的第二个共同之点，就是通过活人活事揭示并解决了这方面各种各样形式的复杂的思想问题。湖北日报在八月二十六日、二十七日、三十日的报道中，就曾揭示了部分农民认为种植晚秋作物“没有什么搞头”、“有几多算几多”，和“多打粮食要多完粮”等错误思想。针对这些落后的保守思想，报道中即以一些先进人物、先进思想、先进事实为例，从“秋收一斗，等于春收一石”、“增产不增税”、种荞麦既不影响种麦，又能增加收入（每亩最少收一百八、九十斤，最多三百斤）等等方面，说明增加农作物收获量对于农民的切身利益。这就在一定程度上鼓舞了农民的生产积极性，并从而扩大了晚秋作物的种植面积。据鄂城不完全统计，荞麦种植面积比去年扩大了四万亩，秧孙面积比去年扩大一倍以上。在为增加农作物收获量的宣传上，宁波大众报也根据当地农村干部中存在着的“重平原、轻山区”、“重细粮、轻杂粮”、“重经济作物、轻杂粮生产”的片面观点，以及某些干部认为“棉区比稻区吃香”、“细粮比杂粮吃香”，因而产生不安心山区工作的现象，运用各种形式进行了比较深刻的批判。如六月十六日读者来信批评了“慈溪县部分干部还有‘轻山区、轻杂粮’的片面观点”。这封来信发表后不久，该报副刊“农村工作干部之友”上即发表了中共慈溪县委书记项耿同志的检讨。在这篇检讨中，项耿同志从检查县委及其本人的领导责任出发，曾以比例数字和具体事实作根据，分析批判了“轻杂粮”的片面观点，及其在干部群众中所造成的恶果，并指出加强杂粮生产和树立全面丰产观点的重要性。又如该报六月十二日“‘今年小麦收成好，抵得上一季稻！’农民告诉我应有全面丰产观点”的报道中，曾以一个乡干部经过具体算账，认识到山区农民在杂粮生产中得到实际收益的事例，教育干部群众必须重视杂粮生产。该报在进行思想批判的同时，还以问答和短评等形式，解释了杂粮生产在人民经济生活中的地位，以及加强杂粮生产对于全面提高农业生产，对于国家工业建设的关系。在农业生产宣传中，报纸及时指明其政治意义，指明其与工业生产的关系，并从而鼓舞农民爱国增产的热情，也都是不可忽视的问题。
    更不可忽视的是，在与争取增加粮食和其他农作物收获量的同时，还必须动员农民注意节约粮食。注意节约粮食，不只是为了防止和克服丰收后可能发生的浪费现象，而且是为了鼓励和发挥农民扩大生产投资增加生产的积极性，为争取来年更大的增产丰收而努力。湖北日报在增产粮食的宣传中是同时贯彻了党的这一方针的。湖北日报一方面在九月七日的报道中，表扬了荥阳一区金寨乡农民减免公粮后把余下的粮食积极投入生产，争取明年多打粮食；另一方面，在八月十九日、二十三日、九月七日的“来信述评”、“农村工作述评”、“来信综述”中，对一些农民因早秋丰收而产生的严重浪费粮食的现象，进行了连续的批判教育。据该报不少读者来信反映：公安县六区张家乡七、八两组一百零五户农民，担谷烧酒的就有九十三户；大冶河铺乡陈西平槽坊两天就烧了四十五石谷的酒。铺张浪费的结果，已使一些农民在生产上、生活上增加了新的困难。湖北日报在批判这些浪费粮食的现象时，首先肯定了农民在丰收之后，生活适当的改善一点、作些文化娱乐，也是应该的；但无论是吃喝、唱戏或办婚丧，都应有个限度，不能因此而造成生产上生活上的困难。其次，该报还着重批判了“多花一些没关系，反正以后可以依靠人民政府”、
  “辛苦了，多花点，只当少收了一点”，“多吃一点不算什么，只当抗旱用了的”等错误想法，和“收不收，吃一秋”的不良习惯。为了正确地耐心地教育农民改变这些错误想法和不良习惯，湖北日报提出要用回忆对比算细账等自我教育的方法，向农民进行政策教育、前途教育，和增产节约、勤劳致富、爱国发家的思想教育，以使农民养成增产节约的新风气。湖北日报对这种刚在农村中露形的浪费粮食的现象，能及时地发现批判，并指出解决途径的作法，无疑是值得提倡的。因此，对农民同时耐心地进行节约粮食的教育，也是报纸当前一个重要的职责。
    当然，湖北日报等报在这一宣传上所以作得比较好，和当地党政领导机关对这一工作的重视，也是分不开的。如湖北省人民政府和农林厅曾在八月二日、九日、二十六日连续地发出关于种植和培育晚秋作物的指示，关于大力领导秋收的指示，和结合秋收秋种大力积肥扩大绿肥种植面积的通知。另外，在九月三日该报还发表了“继续领导群众，大力种植晚秋作物，作好种麦准备工作，争取更大丰收”的社论。代表当地党政领导机关意见的这些指示或社论，就给予报纸在报道思想上以很大启发，和在宣传鼓动上以很大力量。
    现在各地秋收已经或正在开始，各地报纸在粮食增产节约战线上，除应抓紧时间，因地制宜，大力动员群众种植晚秋作物、积极排水防涝、秋耕种麦、节约粮食投入生产，为争取明年丰产而努力外，还要紧紧掌握增产节约粮食的精神，注意报道防霜保产，和细收细打、地净场光、颗粒还家的典型事例，以及有原料、有销路的副业生产的成绩和收获。如果这些工作做得好，对于增加粮食的收获量和增加农民的收入，也都会有很大帮助。
