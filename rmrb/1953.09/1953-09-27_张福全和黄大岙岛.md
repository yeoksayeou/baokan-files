    Zhang Fuquan and Huangdakao Island
    Li Ming
    I.
    One rainy evening in June 1952, Zhang Fuquan, a platoon leader of the Public Security Forces of the People's Liberation Army, was leading his soldiers in a study session indoors when a soldier led two children in. As soon as they entered, the two children happily shouted, "Village Chief Zhang! Village Chief Zhang!" and rushed towards Zhang Fuquan.
    Before Zhang Fuquan could respond, the younger child shook his hand innocently, saying with a hint of complaint, "You forgot about us as soon as you left! You haven't sent us a letter in over a month. Do you know how much we miss you?" The older child added, "People were discussing sending someone to see you a long time ago. Dad said you would definitely write soon. But a month has passed and we still haven't heard from you. Everyone was really anxious, but it was also the fishing season, so they sent us two." Then, he took out a letter and a small package from his pocket and handed them to Zhang Fuquan, explaining in a rush, "This is a letter from everyone on Huangdakao Island to you. This is a pair of socks you forgot to take with you when you left. The mothers have mended them for you. And a bowl cover."
    Zhang Fuquan was usually a very talkative person, but today he couldn't find the right words to thank and comfort these two children, who were visiting him with the thoughts of over ten thousand people. He just changed the children's wet clothes with affection, while repeating two sentences with embarrassment: "I haven't forgotten you, and I will never forget you!"

    II.
    In February 1951, Platoon Leader Zhang Fuquan came to Huangdakao Island in Dongtou County, Zhejiang Province, which had just been liberated, with his troops. At that time, over ten thousand farmers and fishermen on the island, under the harassment and plunder of the remnant bandits of Chiang Kai-shek, dared not go out to sea to fish, nor could they cultivate the land in peace. People could only soak the starch out of sweet potato noodles to sell, and eat the remaining dregs and rotten fish and shrimp salvaged from the seaside to survive.
    In order to help the people of Huangdakao Island establish political power, organize production, and improve their lives, the troops and the People's Government decided to send Zhang Fuquan to Huangdakao Township as the township chief.
    When he received this order, he told the instructor as if he was accepting a combat mission: "I will do everything in my power to make the people of Huangdakao Island live a free and happy life like the people on the mainland of the motherland."
    When he arrived at Huangdakao Township, he immediately went deep into the masses, helping them with their labor and learning about their hardships. At that time, the main difficulty for the people on the island was the lack of food. After investigating, he found that there were still a few relatively wealthy families on the island. He personally went from door to door to persuade them to adopt the method of "free lending, repayable loans" to help poor fishermen. Thanks to his patient persuasion and education, these families voluntarily donated 390 jin of sweet potato flour to help the poor fishermen. After solving the food problem, it was also necessary to dispel the fishermen's concerns about being harassed by remnant bandits and their fear of going out to sea to fish. At a mass meeting, he assured all the fishermen: "Whenever you go out to sea, I will go to protect you. Wherever you go, I will protect you there."
    In this way, the fishermen's courage to go to sea was boosted.
    So the fishermen repaired their boats and nets overnight and prepared food. The next morning, the vast ocean was boiling again. Zhang Fuquan led two other young men, carrying guns and driving a small boat, and was the first to go out to sea. Dozens of fishing boats, with their sails raised, formed a powerful fleet, following closely behind him. On the first day, the fishermen returned safely with a full load, filled with joy they hadn't felt in years.
    On the third day, just as the fishermen were happily fishing, a bandit ship suddenly sailed towards the fishing boats. Zhang Fuquan forcefully suppressed the anger in his heart, and while directing the fishermen to continue fishing, he and the two young men on the boat calmly hid in the cabin. When the bandit ship was about to approach, they climbed out of the cabin, and the three guns fired fiercely at the bandit ship. The sea bandits, who were suddenly attacked, were so frightened that they turned their ship around and fled. This further increased the fishermen's confidence in victory in the struggle against the sea bandits. In less than four months from the beginning of March to July, the fishermen caught 80,000 jin of fish. In order to solve the problem of fish sales, Zhang Fuquan contacted the district and county people's governments and organized fishmongers to come to the island to buy fish. Sometimes, he personally escorted the fishermen to sell fresh fish on the mainland, and then bought grain and daily necessities from the mainland. In just three months, the fishermen personally experienced the importance of being organized. They spontaneously organized fishing teams and a maritime armed force to protect fishing—the militia.

    III.
    Between the two large mountains in front of Daqi Village is the only plain on the island. All the farmers on the island rely on cultivating the land on this plain to maintain their lives. A long time ago, the farmers on the island built a five-li-long dam along the coast to prevent seawater from flooding the fields. Because of years of disrepair, the dam had many gaps that were washed away by the sea, and the raging waves rushed into the rice paddies along the gaps, causing this 1,549-mu fertile land to yield nothing for nine out of ten years. The farmers were too poor to repair the dam.
    After Zhang Fuquan learned the situation in detail, he decided to organize the farmers to build the dam. He first learned the experience of building dams from the older farmers, investigated everything needed to build the dam, and then formulated a detailed dam-building plan and submitted it to the higher-level government for approval and support. The higher-level government immediately lent 700 jin of grain to solve the food problem for the people on the island. Then, he announced the dam-building plan and the assistance from the higher-level government to everyone. Immediately, men, women, old, and young all enthusiastically joined the dam-building project. Zhang Fuquan ran to the construction site every day before dawn to organize everyone, and personally worked in the mud and water, bare-chested, carrying mud, lifting soil, and building the dam with everyone. In twelve days, all the gaps in the dam were repaired. This prevented the annual March wind and waves from rushing into this fertile land again.
    Soon, the green rice seedlings, like bamboo shoots after the rain, rose greenly. Just as the farmers were happy about the upcoming harvest, a large number of locusts suddenly appeared in the rice paddies. When the farmers were worried about this sudden disaster, Zhang Fuquan mobilized and organized the farmers to kill the locusts. In just over ten days, the locusts were wiped out, ensuring an average harvest of 500 jin of rice per mu.

    IV.
    A year has passed, and Huangdakao Island has completely changed its appearance. The farmers have organized farmers' associations; the fishermen have organized fishermen's associations and fishing teams; the women have also organized women's representative meetings and production groups; the children are no longer "wild children," they have gone to the three newly established primary schools and one central primary school on the island to study; during the New Year and festivals, the people on the island also wear clothes made of new cloth bought from the mainland of the motherland, eat newly fried rice cakes, twist the yangko dance, and celebrate their happy life enthusiastically.
    In March 1952, Zhang Fuquan was ordered to return to the army. The people of the island came in groups, beating gongs and drums, to see him off. The elderly, shedding tears like they were seeing off their children who had been away from them for a long time, patted his shoulders and repeatedly said: "We all owe it to the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the People's Liberation Army. We will never forget the great kindness of saving us from death. Write often! Take care of your health, don't make us worry!" Zhu Qingan, the director of the Dajing Village Farmers' Association, held his hand tightly, his eyes filled with tears, and said: "In the past, we were all like children, you pulled us up like a father. We will definitely work hard in your spirit, build Huangdakao Island better, and make the lives of all the people on the island happier." Looking at this beautiful island and the people who had begun to live a life of plenty, Zhang Fuquan said with excitement and emotion: "It is our responsibility to make everyone in our country live a free and happy life."

    张福全和黄大岙岛
    黎明
    一
    一九五二年六月的一个雨天的傍晚，人民解放军公安部队某部排长张福全，正领导着战士们在屋子里学习，一个战士领着两个小孩走了进来。一进门，两个孩子高兴地喊着：“张乡长！张乡长！”便扑向张福全身上。
    张福全还没有来得及回话，较小的孩子便天真地摇着他的手，带着瞒怨的口气说：“离开我们就把我们忘啦，一个多月不给我们来信，你知道我们多想你啊！”较大一点的孩子也接上去说：“很早就有人商议着派人来看你，阿爸都说你一定会很快来信的。可是一个月过去了还没有见你来信，大家真急了，可是又赶上渔汛期，这才派我们俩来。”接着他又从口袋里掏出一封信和一个小纸包交给了张福全，然后滔滔不绝地解释说：“这是我们黄大岙岛全岛人给你的信，这是你临走时忘记带的一双袜子，阿妈们给你补好了。还有一个碗套。”
    张福全本是一个很爱说话的人，但今天他却找不出一句恰当的话来感谢和安慰这两个孩子，他们是带着一万多人的心意来看望他的。他只是一面亲热地给两个孩子换下打湿了的衣服，一面为难似地重复着两句话：“我没有忘记你们，永远也不会忘记你们！”
    二
    一九五一年二月，排长张福全随同部队来到了解放不久的浙江省洞头县黄大岙岛。那时，全岛一万多农民和渔民，在蒋匪残余的侵扰和掠夺下，不敢出海捕鱼，不能安心种田，人们只有把地瓜丝的淀粉浸去卖掉，吃剩下的渣滓和从海边捞来的烂鱼烂虾维持生命。
    为了帮助黄大岙岛人民建立政权，组织生产，改善生活，经部队和人民政府研究，决定派张福全到黄大岙乡担任乡长。
  当他接到这一命令时，像接受战斗任务一样向教导员表示：“尽我所有的力量使黄大岙岛的人民同祖国大陆的人民一样过着自由幸福的生活”。
    到了黄大岙乡，他马上深入到群众中去，一面帮助他们劳动，一面了解他们的疾苦。当时岛上人民的主要困难是缺乏口粮，经他调查发现岛上还有几户比较富裕的人家时，他便亲自挨门逐户去动员他们采取“自由借贷，有借有还”的办法来帮助贫苦渔民。由于他耐心的说服教育，使这几户人家自动捐了三百九十斤地瓜丝救济贫苦渔民。口粮问题解决以后，还必须解除渔民因为害怕残匪骚扰而不敢出海捕鱼的顾虑。在一次群众大会上，他向全体渔民保证：“你们什么时候出海，我就什么时候去保护你们。你们走到那里，我就保护你们到那里。”
    这样，渔民出海的勇气被鼓动起来了。
      于是渔民们连夜修补船、网，准备粮食，第三天清晨，辽阔的海洋又沸腾了。张福全带领着另外两位青年，背着枪，驾驶着一只小船，第一个出海了。数十只渔船，扬着帆，组成一只强大的船队，浩浩荡荡紧跟在他的后面。第一天，渔民们便带着多年没有过的喜悦，安安全全满载而归。
    第三天，正当渔民们兴高采烈地捕鱼的时候，一只匪船突然向渔船驶来，张福全用力压抑着心中的愤怒，一面指挥渔民继续捕鱼，一面和同船的两个青年沉着地隐蔽在船舱里，当匪船快驶近的时候，他们爬出船舱，三枝枪一齐向匪船猛烈射击起来，遭到突然打击的海匪，吓得掉转船头就跑。这就更加提高了渔民同海匪斗争的胜利信心。从三月初到七月的不足四个月的时间里，渔民们便捕鱼八万斤。为了解决鱼的销售问题，张福全又同区、县人民政府联系好，组织鱼贩来岛上买鱼，有时他也亲自掩护渔民，把鲜鱼送到大陆出卖，再从大陆买来粮食和日用品，在短短的三个月中，渔民们亲身体会到组织起来的重要，他们自动组织了捕鱼大队，组织了保护捕鱼的海上武装——民兵。
    三
    大旗村前的两座大山之间，是全岛唯一的平原，全岛农民就依靠经营这块平原上的土地，来维持生活。很早以前，全岛农民曾在海岸筑起了一条长达五里的大坝防止海水淹田。因为年久失修，大坝被海水冲开许多缺口，汹涌的海浪，沿着缺口，冲进稻田，使这块一千五百四十九亩肥沃的土地，十年就有九年颗粒不收。农民由于穷困不堪，也没有力量修坝。
    张福全详细地了解了情况之后，便决定组织农民筑坝。他首先向年老的农民学习了筑坝的经验，调查了筑坝所需要的一切，然后制定了周密的筑坝计划，并提请上级政府批准和支援。上级政府立即借出七百斤粮食解决岛上人民的口粮，接着他就向大家宣布了筑坝计划和上级政府的帮助。马上，男、女、老、少都踊跃投入了筑坝工程。张福全每天天不亮就跑到工地上去组织大家，并亲自在泥水里，光着膀子和大家一起挑泥、抬土、筑坝。十二天，大坝所有的缺口便全部修好。使每年一度的三月风浪再不能冲进这肥沃的土地。
    不久，稻谷的青苗，像雨后春笋一样，绿油油地上升着，农民们正在为这即将获得的丰收高兴时，突然稻田里出现了大批蝗虫。农民都为这突如其来的灾难发愁的时候，张福全又动员和组织农民扑灭蝗虫，十几天的功夫，蝗虫被扑灭了，保证了每亩地平均获得五百斤稻谷的丰收。
    四
    一年过去了，黄大岙岛完全改变了面貌。农民们组织了农会；渔民们组织了渔会和捕鱼大队；妇女们也组织了妇女代表会和生产小组；儿童们再不是“野孩子”了，他们已分别到全岛新办起的三所小学和一所中心小学读书了；过年过节时，全岛人民也穿上了从祖国大陆买来的新布做的衣服，吃着新炸的年糕，扭着秧歌，跳着舞，热烈庆祝着自己幸福的生活。
    一九五二年三月，张福全奉命归队，全岛人民成群结队敲着锣鼓前来送行。老年人，像送别将久离自己的孩子一样流着眼泪，拍着他的肩膀一次又一次重复着：“我们都托了共产党、毛主席和解放军的福。我们永远忘不了你把我们从死里救活的大恩，以后常来信！要保重身体，不要叫我们挂心！”大井村农会主任朱庆安紧握着他的手，眼泪盈眶地说：“过去我们都像些小孩子，你像阿爸一样把我们拉大，我们一定本着你的精神，努力工作，把黄大岙岛建设得更好，使全岛人民的生活过的更幸福。”张福全看着这个美丽的海岛和已开始过着丰衣足食生活的人们，又是兴奋，又是感动地说：“使我们祖国每一个人都过着自由幸福的生活，这是我们的责任。”
