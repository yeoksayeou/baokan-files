    Large Number of Ancient Relics Discovered in兰新 Railway Project Area

    The “Relic Survey and Clearance Team of the兰新 Railway Project Area” organized by the Gansu Provincial People's Government Cultural Relics Management Committee has discovered a large number of stone tools, pottery, and bronze ware in the Datong area of Yongdeng since it began work on May 21. This is of great help in studying ancient history. Among them are 36 pieces of prehistoric Neolithic pottery such as jars and bowls, all handmade. Two-thirds are painted pottery and plain red pottery containers, with patterns such as rhombuses and rope patterns. One-third are coarse plain red pottery, and many of the pottery pieces have traces of burning on the outside of the abdomen, proving that they were cooking utensils. Among them, there is a flat-bottomed coarse plain red pottery cooking utensil, which still contains some grains inside, providing valuable information for the study of ancient agricultural production in my country.

    In addition, ten polished stone tools from the prehistoric Neolithic Age were discovered, shaped like knives, axes, and chisels; 53 pieces of gray pottery from the Han Dynasty were discovered, shaped like altars, jars, pots, bowls, stoves, etc., all with rope patterns and flat bottoms, and most of them were wheel-made funerary objects. There were also 15 pieces of bronze ware from the Han and Sui dynasties (including three Han mirrors, one Sui mirror, and two Han bronze belt hooks), and more than 600 coins from the Han and Tang dynasties; and four finely crafted green porcelain bowls with hidden flower patterns from the Song Dynasty. Multiple prehistoric and Han Dynasty ruins have been discovered on a terrace about 30 to 40 meters high on the east side of the railway outside the east gate of Mancheng in Yongdeng, on the west bank of the Zhuanglang River, at the mouth of the Dasha Gully, on the Xiongjia Yaitou terraces, and in the area from outside the east gate of Mancheng in Yongdeng County to outside the east gate of Yongdeng County.

    The precious cultural relics unearthed above and the prehistoric and Han Dynasty ruins discovered illustrate how the working people of past dynasties used their wisdom to create brilliant cultural achievements.

    Repair Project of the Badaling Section of the Great Wall Begins

    The repair project of the Badaling section of the Great Wall, a great ancient building in our country, officially started on August 21. The Badaling section is located in a dangerous terrain with steep cliffs and was once an important passage to the outside of the Great Wall. Due to years of disrepair, coupled with the destruction by Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek bandits, it has been greatly damaged. This year, the Central People's Government allocated special funds and appointed technical personnel to design and guide the project. People's governments at all levels also transferred cadres to form a temporary construction committee to lead the repair project. At present, hundreds of workers are working hard to complete the project on National Day, October 1.
