Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 6th—Today, September 6th, our side has completed the repatriation of all enemy prisoners of war eligible for direct repatriation. Today, our side repatriated 125 non-Korean prisoners of war and 7 Korean prisoners of war to the other side, totaling 132 prisoners. The non-Korean prisoners of war included 111 American, 8 British, 4 Turkish, 1 South African, and 1 Japanese. The American prisoners of war included 25 air force personnel who had confessed to participating in bacteriological warfare and were exempted from prosecution by the Korean People's Army authorities.

The other side repatriated 2,256 captured personnel of the Korean People's Army to our side, including 75 wounded and sick personnel; and 138 captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers, including 4 wounded and sick personnel.

Under our repeated protests and the pressure of just public opinion, the U.S. side today repatriated the representatives of the Korean and Chinese captured personnel who persisted in the struggle for repatriation, Park Sang-hyun, Li Ren-zhe, Kim Tae-hoon, Shin Tae-bong, Wu Cheng-de, Wang Fang, Wei Lin, and Sun Zhen-guan. They have suffered long-term imprisonment and torture by the U.S. side and are extremely weak and haggard. Wu Cheng-de, a captured member of the Chinese People's Volunteers, has lost half of his hair due to inhuman abuse. They were warmly welcomed by our staff upon arrival at our exchange area. Major General Park Il-young and Major General Ding Guoyu, members of the Korean-Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission, and Du Ping, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteers, were present to welcome them.

At yesterday's meeting of the Prisoner of War Repatriation Committee, the U.S. Chief Commissioner, Mr. Frederstad, stated that he would repatriate all our captured personnel eligible for direct repatriation today. But in fact, only 138 captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers were repatriated today, which is more than 100 fewer than the 250 captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers that U.S. Secretary of the Army Stevens publicly admitted that the U.S. side was detaining.

    对应予直接遣返的对方战俘
    我方已经全部遣送完毕
    【新华社开城六日电】九月六日，我方已将应予直接遣返的对方战俘全部遣送完毕。今日我方遣送给对方非朝鲜籍战俘一百二十五名，朝鲜籍战俘七名，共一百三十二名。在非朝鲜籍战俘中包括美国籍一百十一名、英国籍八名、土耳其籍四名、南非联邦籍一名、日本籍一名。在美籍战俘中包括曾供认参加进行细菌战而为朝鲜人民军当局免予法办的二十五名空军人员。
    对方遣送给我方朝鲜人民军被俘人员两千二百五十六名，其中包括伤病人员七十五名；中国人民志愿军被俘人员一百三十八名，其中包括伤病人员四名。
    在我方再三抗议和公正舆论的压力下，美方今日已将朝中被俘人员坚持遣返斗争的代表朴相显、李仁哲、金泰勋、申泰凤、吴成德、王芳、魏林、孙振冠等人遣返回来。他们遭受美方长期囚禁与折磨，身体极为虚弱，面色憔悴。中国人民志愿军被俘人员吴成德的头发已经由于非人的虐待而脱落了一半。他们到达我方交换区后，受到了我方工作人员的热烈欢迎。军事停战委员会朝中方面委员朴一英将军、丁国钰将军及中国人民志愿军政治部副主任杜平将军均在场欢迎。
    在昨日的战俘遣返委员会会议上，美方首席委员弗莱德斯达夫曾表示将于今日遣返一切应予直接遣返的我方被俘人员。但事实上，今天被遣返回来的中国人民志愿军被俘人员只有一百三十八名，比美国陆军部长斯蒂文斯曾公开承认的美方扣留着二百五十名的中国人民志愿军被俘人员的数字还少一百多名。
