Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 5th: Just as the Yoshida government's negotiations to accept the U.S. Mutual Security Agency "aid" are entering their final stage, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles has once again publicly urged Japan to speed up its rearmament. Before this, Dulles and U.S. Senator Nolan had personally come to Tokyo to urge the Yoshida government to accelerate the pace of rearmament.

Dulles said in Washington on the 3rd, "He believes Japan needs a larger security force than it has now." United Press reporter Hansley quoted "American officials" in Washington as saying, "Secretary of State Dulles' statement at a press conference today that Japan must make greater efforts in rearmament is an attempt to expedite the conclusion of a military assistance agreement between Japan and the United States." It is known that this "military assistance agreement" is the agreement between the Yoshida government and the United States, which began negotiations on July 15, for Japan to accept U.S. Mutual Security Agency "aid." From the beginning of the negotiations until August 21, eight meetings have been held. Due to the failure to reach an agreement on the specific number of armed forces to be increased in Japan, the negotiations were adjourned until September 2. Dulles's remarks were made the day after the negotiations resumed.

According to United Press reporter Hansley, "Japan has notified the U.S. State Department that Japan intends to increase its troops by 20,000 each year," and "This rate of increase is obviously not satisfactory to Dulles." Therefore, "Dulles has become impatient." He hinted in his statement that if Yoshida does not speed up rearmament according to the wishes of the United States, the United States may stop supporting him. Hansley reported, "Some people speculate based on Dulles' attitude that he would welcome the reinstatement of Hitoshi Ashida, who once served as prime minister during the occupation," because "Ashida is one of the staunch advocates of Japanese rearmament."

Under the constant urging of the United States, the Yoshida government is nervously drafting a large-scale rearmament plan to be submitted to the United States. Yoshida has also decided to send former Finance Minister and Chairman of the Policy Research Council of the Liberal Party, Hayato Ikeda, to the United States in mid-September to discuss the issue of rearmament. According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Tokyo on August 23, Yoshida has decided to personally "visit" the United States this fall. Agence France-Presse also revealed that Yoshida's purpose in going to the United States is to exchange Japan's rearmament for greater U.S. support for him.

    在杜勒斯等不断督促下
    吉田政府正加紧重新武装
    【新华社五日讯】东京消息：正当吉田政府接受美国共同安全署“援助”的谈判进入最后阶段的时候，美国国务卿杜勒斯又一次公开督促日本加紧重新武装。在这以前，杜勒斯和美国参议员诺兰都曾亲自到东京来催促吉田政府加快重新武装的速度。
    杜勒斯三日在华盛顿发表谈话说：“他相信日本需要一支比现在大一些的保安部队”。合众社记者汉斯莱援引华盛顿“美国官员”的话说：“国务卿杜勒斯今天所以在记者招待会上发表声明说日本必须在重新武装方面作出更大的努力，是企图加快日本和美国的军事援助协定的缔结。”大家知道，这个“军事援助协定”就是吉田政府和美国从七月十五日开始谈判的日本接受美国共同安全署“援助”的协定。谈判自开始到八月二十一日止已先后举行八次会议。由于在日本增加武装部队的具体数目上未能达成协议，谈判休会至九月二日。杜勒斯的谈话就是在谈判复会后的第二天发表的。
    据合众社记者汉斯莱报道：“日本已通知美国国务院，日本打算每年增加二万名部队”，“这种增加速度显然不能使杜勒斯满意”。因此，“杜勒斯已感到不耐烦了”。他在发表声明时暗示，如果吉田不按照美国的意思加紧重新武装，美国可能会停止对他的支持。汉斯莱报道说：“某些人士根据杜勒斯的态度推测，他将欢迎在占领时期曾一度担任首相的芦田均复职”，因为“芦田均是坚决主张日本重新武装的人物之一”。
    在美国的不断督促下，吉田政府正在紧张地草拟提交美国的大规模重新武装的计划，吉田并已决定在九月中旬派前任藏相、吉田自由党政务调查会会长池田勇人到美国去商谈重新武装的问题。据法新社东京八月二十三日电报道，吉田已决定在今年秋季亲自到美国去“访问”。法新社并透露，吉田赴美的目的是要以日本的重新武装来换取美国对他的更大支持。
