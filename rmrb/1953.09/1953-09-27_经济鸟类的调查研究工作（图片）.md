As far as is known, nearly two thousand species and subspecies of birds live in China's vast land. In the past, research on these birds was limited to the scope of pure taxonomy. Now, scientific workers have recognized the importance of science serving production and are pushing bird investigation and research work onto the road of serving production.

In order to study how to prevent and control harmful birds in fruit-growing areas, protect beneficial birds in fruit-growing areas, and provide necessary reference materials for the future formulation of hunting laws, bird research workers from the Institute of Zoology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences conducted targeted and systematic economic bird surveys and research in Changli and nearby areas, the center of fruit production in northeastern Hebei Province. In this work, which lasted less than three months, they hunted nearly 1,500 birds belonging to more than 130 species and made many preliminary discoveries. For example, the red-billed crow, which is relatively common in the area, is generally considered a harmful bird, but after dissecting and examining the specimens collected in April and May during this research work, it was found that although it eats some sorghum, peanuts, cypress seeds, etc., its main food is pests on fruit trees, especially the larvae of pests. In this way, it can at least be said that during the period of April and May, the red-billed crow is more beneficial than harmful.

This investigation and research work is just a beginning, and the experience gained from this work will help in future large-scale economic bird investigation and research work. *People's Pictorial* Manuscript, Photos by Peng Huashi and He Shiyao

	Research workers went deep among the masses to understand the activities of birds and received enthusiastic help from local farmers.
	Researchers examine the food in the stomachs of various birds in the laboratory to determine whether they are beneficial or harmful.
	Local children spontaneously catch various birds to provide research data for the investigation. This researcher is kindly explaining the bird's living habits to the children and telling them: When shooting birds, shoot harmful birds and not beneficial birds.
	Investigation staff are observing the habits and feeding habits of birds.
	Leading comrades of bird research work, together with the person in charge of the pest and disease group of the Changli Hebei Provincial Fruit Tree Horticultural Experimental Farm, are jointly studying the fragments of pests found in the stomachs of birds.
	After the birds are skinned and stuffed, they are packed into boxes in batches and transported back to Beijing for research purposes. Some of them will be exchanged with research institutions and museums at home and abroad.
	During breaks, investigation and research workers watch the specimens they have collected and talk about their experiences in hunting specimens.
	On the coast of Changli, large eagles and many seagulls, sea swallows, sand snipes, etc. were hunted.

    经济鸟类的调查研究工作
    就现在所知，在我国广阔的土地上生活着近二千种和亚种的禽鸟。过去对这些鸟类的研究工作只限于单纯的分类学范围。现在，科学工作者们认清了科学为生产服务的重要性，正把鸟类的调查研究工作推向为生产服务的道路。
    中国科学院动物研究室的鸟类研究工作者们为了研究如何防除果区害鸟，护殖果区益鸟，并为日后制定狩猎法提供必要的参考资料，曾在河北省东北部出产水果的中心——昌黎及附近地区进行了有目的、有系统的经济鸟类调查研究工作。他们在这一次历时不到三个月的工作中，已猎得将近一千五百号分隸一百三十余种的禽鸟，并有许多初步的发现。如该地比较常见的红嘴乌鸦，一般人都认为它是害鸟，但在这次研究工作中把四、五月间所采得的标本加以剖析检验之后，却发现它虽然吃一部分高粱、花生、柏树种子等，但它的主要食物是果树上的害虫，特别是害虫的幼虫。这样，至少可以说：在四、五月这个时期里，红嘴乌鸦是益处多于害处的。
    这一调查研究工作，仅仅是一个开始，这次工作所得的经验将有助于今后较大规模的经济鸟类调查研究工作。人民画报稿　彭华士、何世尧摄影
    研究工作人员深入群众，了解鸟类活动的情况，得到当地农民的热情帮助。
    研究人员在实验室里检验各种禽鸟胃里的食物，以确定它们是益鸟还是害鸟。
    当地的小朋友自动捕捉各种禽鸟，为调查工作提供研究资料。这位研究工作者正在亲切地向小朋友们讲解鸟的生活习性，并对他们说：在平常打鸟的时候，要打害鸟，不要打益鸟。
    调查工作人员正在观察禽鸟的习性和觅食情况。
    鸟类研究工作的领导同志在昌黎河北省果树园艺试验场和该场病虫害组的负责人共同研究由鸟胃中检验所得的害虫碎片。
    禽鸟经剥制后，一批一批地装箱，运回北京，供研究用。其中一部分将与国内外各研究机关和博物馆交换标本。
    休息的时候，调查研究工作人员们互相观看所采得的标本，并交谈着猎取标本的经验。
    在昌黎海滨，猎得了大鹰和不少的海鸥、海?、沙锥等。
