Make an effort to increase crop yields is the current major combat mission of rural workers, and also the main and long-term policy of agricultural production. Rural work cadres in all regions must quickly lead and organize farmers to fight to achieve this task by all means.

Under the current conditions in our country, it is possible and necessary to increase this year's crop yields. Especially this year, although we have also expanded some cultivated land area, the invasion of various natural disasters may reduce our harvest compared to the expected target. Therefore, it is even more necessary to use all means at present to maximize the yield of grain and other crops. This is not only of great significance for ensuring the successful completion of this year's national plan and laying a material foundation for next year's production, but also creates experience for further increasing the yield of various crops in the future.

To increase this year's crop yields, we must first eliminate some ideological obstacles among cadres and the masses. Some people think: it is too late now, this year's harvest is already set, and even if you want to increase the harvest, you can't do anything about it. Some people think: agriculture is too limited by the seasons, and there is no way to think about it. Some people think: even if agriculture can increase production a little bit this year, it will not have much effect on the whole country; it is better to accumulate strength and leave it for next year's big effort. In some areas, after a long drought, it rains or after being flooded, the local cadres think that "a thousand-jin stone has fallen to the ground," and they relax in leading production. In some areas that have been hit by disasters continuously, local cadres become pessimistic and disappointed, and some county cadres are even afraid to go to the disaster areas to work again. In some areas that have had good harvests in summer and early autumn, local cadres think that there is no need to spend a lot of effort to strive for increased production in late autumn and to plant more autumn and winter crops. Some of these ideas are originally held by the cadres themselves, and some are infected from some of the masses; but no matter what, as long as the cadres have these unhealthy ideas, the masses will be greatly affected. If we do not break these harmful ideas, we will not be able to increase this year's crop yields.

This year, we have made great efforts to strive for increased agricultural production. Rural work cadres in various regions have done much more practical work than in previous years, resisted heavy attacks from disasters, and achieved good harvests in most areas. This is undoubtedly gratifying. However, if we have a little bit of complacency, no longer look forward or only see our own region without understanding the national situation, then we are wrong. No matter in which region, as long as there is still a little possibility of increasing production, we must make full use of it. We have no reason to despise one mu of land or even one crop at any time. "Save one more tree, harvest one more grain"; our country is so vast, as long as every village and everyone cherish one mu of land and one crop, the total will be considerable.

At present, many late autumn crops have not yet matured, and some winter crops can still be planted. Production can be increased from these two aspects. For example, there are more than 60 million mu of late rice in the Central and Southern District, which is equal to the area of early rice, which is equal to more than 26% of the total rice planting area in the Central and Southern District. Late rice in Zhejiang Province accounts for more than half of all rice; late autumn coarse grains account for two-thirds of all coarse grains. The buckwheat planting area in many areas has increased a lot compared to previous years. Sweet potatoes (yams), which are growing in vast areas, are also important crops that farmers call "half-year grain." Because there is more rain and less sunshine this year, the major autumn crops in some areas of Northeast and North China are also maturing relatively late. For these crops, strengthening protection work, improving field management, and appropriately promoting early maturity can still strive for more harvest. In addition, most areas, especially areas with poor summer and autumn harvests and near cities, can still grow some vegetables, radishes, and turnips, and can also plant rapeseed, broad beans, peas, barley, etc. for next spring. These can increase a part of the harvest.

Although some crops have matured or have been harvested, we can also strive to increase the harvest rate by reducing losses. Because the harvesting is not timely or meticulous, some areas are often "ten-point fields, eight-point harvest," "high yield but not high harvest"; if we can achieve "how many years of harvest there are, how many percent of harvest there are," we will harvest a lot more grain. Therefore, improving harvesting methods is very meaningful. For example, harvesting as soon as it is ripe and shortening the harvesting time can avoid unexpected wind and rain; generally, crops are harvested when they are just ripe and not too dry, beans are harvested in the morning while there is dew, millet is bundled as it is harvested, etc., which can reduce grain falling in the field. In waterlogged areas, autumn remnants should be salvaged as much as possible. For crops that have been harvested, the time left in the field should be shortened as much as possible; after being transported to the threshing floor, fire, wind, and rain should be prevented, and when threshing, the grains should be mixed in the hay as little as possible and scattered as little as possible. After threshing, it should be dried as early as possible; before and after entering the warehouse, moisture-proof, insect-proof, and rodent-proof work should be done. Special attention should be paid to the harvest and storage of sweet potatoes; last year, sweet potatoes in various places suffered huge losses due to frost and mold, which affected the lives of the farmers for several months. This is a lesson that should be remembered.

In order to do these tasks well, we must rely on the masses and concentrate the strength and wisdom of the masses to solve difficulties, and we must never adopt a passive attitude. In some places, the rice is dried to death, and the farmers are still unwilling to pull out the dead stalks and replant coarse grains; even if they are planted, they do not pay attention to processing and fertilizing. Some farmers in disaster-stricken areas have no intention of striving for increased production in late autumn, and are intent on going out and finding work in the city. In some places with good harvests, farmers are casual about harvesting and threshing. Cadres in various regions should address these practical situations, overcome the negative thoughts and emotions of some of the masses, combine the interests of the masses with the interests of the country, the current interests with the long-term interests, do a good job in publicizing and explaining the tax policy, the mutual assistance and cooperation policy, and the national construction plan, and encourage all farmers to strive to increase harvests.

At the same time, we must earnestly help farmers, especially farmers in disaster areas, solve some practical difficulties, such as shortage of food, shortage of seeds, shortage of fertilizer, shortage of livestock, shortage of agricultural tools, or too busy autumn farming and insufficient manpower allocation. To solve the difficulty of manpower, we must reverse the idea of ​​underestimating temporary mutual aid groups and strengthen the leadership of temporary mutual aid groups; we must grasp appropriate wage standards to adjust the labor force between areas with different harvest times; we must grasp the principle of equal pay for equal work to mobilize women to participate in field production. To solve material difficulties, we must specifically analyze the causes of these difficulties and the various conditions in the local area to overcome these difficulties, and try to solve them locally as much as possible; we should ask for national support only when it is really impossible to solve them. Local party committees and people's governments at all levels must strengthen the leadership of economic departments such as supply and marketing and finance, so that they can fully play an active role in serving production. We must prevent the tendency to call for increased production in general or blindly follow some of the masses to complain, and actively take practical measures to increase harvests.

Facts have proved that as long as active measures are taken, crop yields can definitely be increased. Fuyang Prefecture and Suxian Prefecture in Anhui Province actively fought drought and rescued late autumn crops, turning hundreds of thousands of mu of late autumn, soybeans, and sweet potatoes from yellow to green. After drainage and rescue, most of the more than 100,000 mu of waterlogged crops in Tai'an Prefecture, Shandong Province, can still approach last year's yield, and some places can even increase production by 10% compared with last year. After the eradication of insect pests in many places, late autumn crops have grown vigorously again. Supply and marketing cooperatives in many places have solved the difficulty of farmers lacking fertilizer by using local materials, processing locally, and promoting locally. These facts prove that we can do many effective things to increase the harvest of autumn and winter crops. This year, the area of ​​late autumn planting in various places has been expanded compared with the past. The masses generally have a high degree of enthusiasm, and the cadres have generally gained a lot of experience in leading the masses to fight against disasters and strive for increased production. These are favorable conditions for increasing the total harvest of crops this year. Rural work cadres in various places should have full confidence, mobilize the broad masses of farmers, and exert the greatest strength and wisdom to fight for increasing the harvest of autumn and winter crops!

### 尽最后努力提高农作物的收获量

    尽最后努力提高农作物的收获量
    努力提高农作物的收获量，是农村工作者当前的重大的战斗任务，也是农业生产的主要的和长远的方针。各地农村工作干部必须迅速领导和组织农民用一切办法为实现这一任务而奋斗。
    在我国目前的条件下，提高今年农作物的收获量是可能的也是必需的。特别是今年，我们虽然也扩大了一些耕地面积，可是各种自然灾害的侵袭，使我们的收成较预计目标可能减少，因此在目前用一切办法把粮食和其他农作物的收获量提高到最大限度，就更属必要。这不仅对于保证今年国家计划的胜利完成，并为明年的生产打下物质基础，具有重要意义；而且也可以为今后进一步提高各种农作物的收获量创造经验。
    要提高今年农作物收获量，首先要扫除干部和群众中的一些思想障碍。有些人认为：现在为时已晚了，今年的收成已经定局，即使想要增加收获量也使不上劲了。有些人认为：农业受季节的限制太大，没有办法可想了。有些人认为：今年农业上即使还能增产一点点，对整个国家也起不了多大作用；还是把力量积蓄起来，留着明年大干吧。有些地区久旱之后下了雨或者被淹之后排了水，当地干部就认为“千斤石头落了地”，在领导生产方面松劲了。有些地区连续受灾，当地干部就悲观失望起来，有的县干部甚至怕再到受灾地区去工作。有些地区夏季和早秋丰收了，当地干部就认为不必再费很大力气去争取晚秋增产、更多种植一些秋冬作物。这些思想，有些是干部自己本来就有的，有些是从部分群众感染得来的；但是，不管如何，只要干部一有了这些不健康的思想，就会使群众受到很大的影响。不打破这些有害的思想，我们就不能提高今年农作物的收获量。
    今年我们为了争取农业的增产已经作了巨大的努力，各地农村工作干部做了许多比往年更加切实的工作，抵挡了重重灾害的袭击，大部地区得到了好收成。这无疑是值得高兴的。可是，如果我们有一丝一毫的自满，眼睛不再向前看或只看到本地区而不了解全国情况，这就错了。无论在那个地区，只要还有一点增产的可能性，我们就要把它充分地利用起来。我们任何时候也没有理由轻视一亩地甚至一棵庄稼。“救一棵多一棵，收一粒多一粒”；我们的国土是这样广大，只要每个村子、每个人都十分珍视一亩地、一棵庄稼，加起来就有相当可观的数量。
    目前有许多晚秋作物还没有成熟，有一些冬季作物还可以种植，从这两方面都还可以增加产量。如中南区的晚稻有六千多万亩，和早稻的面积相等，等于中南区全部水稻种植面积的百分之二十六强。浙江省的晚稻占全部稻子的一半以上；晚秋杂粮占全部杂粮的三分之二。许多地区荞麦播种面积都比往年增加了很多。广大地区正在生长着的甘薯（红薯），也是被农民称之为“半年粮”的重要作物。因为今年雨水较多、日照较少，东北和华北部分地区的大秋作物成熟得也比较迟。对于这些作物，加强防护工作，改进田间管理，适当促使早熟，还是能够争取多收的。此外，大部地区，特别是夏秋歉收的地区和城市附近，目前还可以多种一些蔬菜、萝卜、蔓菁，也可以种植明春的油菜、蚕豆、豌豆、大麦等。这些都可以增加一部分收获量。
    有些作物虽然已经成熟或者已经收割，也还可以从减少损失方面努力提高收获率。因为收割不及时或不细致，有些地区往往是“十分田，八分收”，“丰产不丰收”；如果能作到“有几成年景就有几成收成”，将会多收许多粮食。因此，改进收割方法是很有意义的。如随熟随割、缩短收割时间，可以避免意外的风雨；一般作物在刚成熟而又不太干的时候收割、豆子在早晨趁露水收割、谷子随割随捆等等，都可以减少田间落粒。在水涝地区应尽可能打捞残秋。对于已经收割了的庄稼，要尽可能缩短留放在地里的时间；运到打谷场以后要防火防风防雨，脱粒时要使谷粒尽可能少夹杂在谷草里、少飞迸散失。脱粒之后，还要使它早些干燥；入仓前后还要做好防潮、防蛀、防鼠的工作。甘薯的收获和储藏，更需特别注意；去年各地甘薯曾因受冻霉烂受到巨大损失，影响到农民群众几个月的生活，是一个应当记取的教训。
    为了作好这些工作，必须依靠群众，集中群众的力量和智慧来解决困难，决不能采取消极态度。有些地方稻子旱死了，农民仍然不愿把枯秆拔掉改种杂粮；即使种上了，也不重视加工施肥。有一些受灾地区的农民无心再争取晚秋增产，一心想出外，想进城找工作。有些丰收的地方农民对于收割、打场漫不经心。各地干部应当针对这些实际情况，克服部分群众消极的思想情绪，把群众利益和国家利益、当前利益和长远利益结合起来，做好税收政策、互助合作政策和国家建设计划的宣传解释工作，鼓舞全体农民为增加收获量而奋斗。
    同时还要认真地帮助农民、特别是帮助灾区农民解决一些实际困难，如缺口粮，缺种子，缺肥料，缺牲口，缺农具，或者秋季农事太忙人力调配不开等等。要解决人力上的困难，就必须扭转轻视临时互助组的思想，加强对临时互助组的领导；就必须掌握适当的工资标准以调剂收获先后不同的地区之间的劳动力；就必须掌握同劳同酬的原则以动员妇女参加田间生产。要解决物质上的困难，就要具体地分析造成这些困难的原因，和当地克服这些困难的各种条件，尽可能先设法就地解决；确实不能解决时再要求国家支持。各级地方党委和人民政府必须加强对供销、金融等经济部门的领导，使他们充分发挥为生产服务的积极作用。我们要防止笼统地号召增产或盲目地跟着一些群众叫苦的倾向，而积极地采取实际办法来增加收获量。
    事实证明，只要采取积极办法，就一定能够提高农作物的收获量。安徽阜阳专区和宿县专区积极抗旱抢救晚秋作物，已使数十万亩晚秋、黄豆、红薯由黄转青。山东泰安专区十几万亩受涝的庄稼，经排水抢救以后大部分还可以接近去年的产量，有的地方还可以比去年增产一成。许多地方扑灭了虫害之后晚秋作物已经重新旺盛地生长起来。许多地方的供销合作社用就地取材、就地加工、就地推销的办法解决了农民缺乏肥料的困难。这些事实都证明我们是能够为增加秋冬农作物的收获量做许多有效的工作的。今年各地播种晚秋的面积都比过去扩大了，群众一般是有很高积极性的，干部一般地也取得了领导群众和灾害作斗争、争取增产的许多经验，这是增加今年农作物总收获量的有利条件。各地农村工作干部应有充分信心，动员广大农民，发挥最大的力量和智慧，为增加秋冬农作物的收获量而斗争！
