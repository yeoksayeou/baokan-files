The sculptor Georges Saupique, winner of the World Peace Council's International Peace Gold Medal in 1952, was born in 1890 in Romaneche, Ain, France. He graduated from the Lyon School of Fine Arts and won the first prize in sculpture.

Georges Saupique participated in World War I from 1914 to 1918, was commended five times, and received the Combat Medal and the Military Medal. From 1940 to 1945, he organized and led the armed forces of the anti-enemy movement "France First" and "Guerrilla," fighting the German invaders in the areas between Satroux and Lyon, and leading his armed forces to liberate Lyon. He is the chairman of the Rhône Peace Movement Committee and the vice-chairman of the Republican Association of Former Veterans.

From 1949 to 1950, he hosted the "Art and Peace" International Exhibition in Lyon, uniting 231 artists from fourteen countries with different opinions and different art schools, exhibiting 332 works, with more than 15,000 visitors. This exhibition was also a powerful demonstration in support of peace. The Lyon "Stockholm Appeal" signature campaign began at this exhibition. At Saupique's initiative, the artists participating in the exhibition also jointly wrote a letter to the chairman of the French government military court, requesting the release of eighteen peace advocates in Roanne, including Jean Baitaulle.

Georges Saupique's works are housed in various museums: a portrait of Utrillo and a nude are in the Paris Museum of Modern Art. Portraits of Suzanne Valadon and the composer Vicovsky, Walter Hirschberg, and several other nudes are in the museums of Lyon and Grenoble. There are also memorial statues in Lyon's parks, such as those of Henri Barbusse and Paul Vaillant-Couturier. From 1946 to 1948, Saupique also sculpted several anti-enemy memorial statues, such as the "Stone Watchman" in the Place Bellecour in Lyon, "The Anti-Enemy Movement in the University" in the Place Olivier in Lyon, and "Relief for Children in Wartime" in Biel, Switzerland. In addition, there is the famous bust of Henri Martin, which was vandalized by fascist bandits when it was displayed at the Southeast Museum of Fine Arts in Lyon. Later, the "Committee for the Defense of Culture and Freedom of Speech" raised more than 100,000 francs to provide Saupique with a new stone, and he rebuilt the giant bust of Henri Martin. This statue is more beautiful and vivid than the first. However, it was recently vandalized by another gang of bandits in the Youth Sculpture Museum in Paris. Because the bandits hated the peaceful people represented by this bust, and hated the artists who fought for peace.

However, a larger-scale protest movement is being organized, and Georges Saupique will recast the Henri Martin statue for the third time. This is a concrete manifestation of the continuous struggle of the French people and the people's artist Georges Saupique to strive for the release of Henri Martin and for world peace.

Note: Henri Martin is a famous French peace fighter and a member of the National Committee of the Republican Youth League of France. He was sentenced to five years of hard labor in 1950 because he opposed the colonial war waged by the French government in Indochina. For three years, the French people have been fighting for Henri Martin's release and finally won the victory. The French government had no choice but to release Henri Martin on August 2 this year.

    法国雕刻家乔治·萨朗德
    ——国际和平奖金和金质奖章一九五二年得奖美术家介绍之四
    沈嘉
    世界和平理事会国际和平金质奖章一九五二年得奖者雕刻家乔治·萨朗德，一八九○年生于法国安省的罗曼湼施地方。他毕业于里昂美术学院，并获得雕刻第一奖。
    乔治·萨朗德曾参加一九一四年至一九一八年的第一次世界大战，受到五次表扬，获得战斗勋章和军事奖章。从一九四○年至一九四五年，他组织和领导了抗敌运动的武装部队“法国第一”和“游击队”，在萨特洛和里昂之间各个地区与德寇战斗，并率领他的武装部队解放里昂。他是罗尼省和平运动委员会的主席和旧参战军人共和协会的副主席。
    在一九四九年至一九五○年间，他在里昂主办了“艺术与和平”国际展览会，联合了各种不同见解和不同艺术学派的十四个国家的二百三十一个艺术家，展出了三百三十二件作品，观众达一万五千余人。这个展览会，同时也是一次拥护和平的强有力的示威。里昂的“斯德哥尔摩宣言”签名运动就是在这次展览会上开始的。在萨朗德的发动下，参加展览会的艺术家并联名写信给法国政府军事法庭主席，要求释放罗安内城的十八名和平拥护者，其中包括约翰·毕塔伐尔。
    乔治·萨朗德的作品分藏在各个博物馆中：尤特里罗像和一个裸体像藏在巴黎现代艺术博物馆。苏赞娜·瓦拉东像和作曲家维可夫斯基像、华尔特·吉尔什堡像以及其它几个裸体像都藏在里昂和格城的博物馆中。在里昂的还有公园里的纪念像，如亨利·巴比塞和保罗·瓦扬·古久里的像。从一九四六年至一九四八年，萨朗德还雕刻了几座抗敌纪念像，如在里昂贝尔顾广场的“石头的看守人”，里昂奥利维埃广场的“大学中的抗敌运动”，在瑞士贝尔的“救济战时儿童”等。此外还有著名的亨利·马丁的半身像，这个像陈列在里昂东南美术馆时，曾被法西斯匪徒破坏了，后来由“保卫文化与言论自由委员会”的发起，征集了十多万法郎，供给萨朗德一块新的石头，他重新建立了亨利·马丁的半身巨像。这个像比第一个更美丽、更生动。可是不久以前在巴黎的青年雕刻美术馆中又被另一帮匪徒破坏了。因为匪徒们仇恨这座半身像所代表的和平人民，并仇恨为和平而斗争的艺术家。
    但是，一个更大规模的抗议运动正在组织中，乔治·萨朗德将第三次重雕亨利·马丁像。这是法国人民和人民艺术家乔治·萨朗德为争取释放亨利·马丁、争取世界和平而一直坚持斗争的具体表现。
    按：亨利·马丁是法国著名的和平战士、法兰西共和青年联盟全国委员会委员。因为他反对法国政府在印度支那进行的殖民战争，于一九五○年被判五年苦役。三年来法国人民一直为争取亨利·马丁出狱而坚持斗争，终于获得了胜利。法国政府不得不在今年八月二日将亨利·马丁释放。
