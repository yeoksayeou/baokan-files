    【Report from this newspaper】To express sympathy and solicitude to all workers participating in the Hainan Island highway project and to better understand the situation of the Hainan Island highway project, the Central Ministry of Communications has formed a consolation work group, led by Zhang Ce, Deputy Minister of the Central Ministry of Communications, which departed from Beijing on the 16th for Hainan Island.
    Hainan Island is a large island in southern China, located in the subtropical zone, with abundant mineral deposits and various products. After liberation, the state began highway construction on Hainan Island. The highway construction project on Hainan Island is very arduous, requiring crossing the steep Wuzhi Mountain area, where the climate is harsh, infectious diseases are prevalent, transportation is inconvenient, and material supplies are difficult. However, thanks to the efforts of all workers to overcome various obstacles, the highway construction is progressing smoothly.

    中央交通部慰问工作团出发
    慰问修筑海南岛公路的职工
    【本报讯】中央交通部为慰问参加海南岛公路工程的全体职工，和更具体地了解海南岛公路工程的情况，已组成慰问工作团，由中央交通部副部长张策率领，十六日由京启程赴海南岛。
    海南岛是我国南部的一个大岛，位居亚热带，矿藏及各种物产都很丰富。解放后，国家就在海南岛进行了公路建设。海南岛公路建设工程非常艰巨，要越过地势险峻的五指山区，那里气候恶劣，流行病盛行，交通不便，物资供应不易，但由于全体职工努力克服种种障碍，公路建设正在顺利进行。
