The Fourth Factory (Zinc Smelting Workshop) of the Hunan Shuikoushan Mining Bureau, thanks to the initiative and creativity of the workers, the close integration of technical personnel and workers, and the leadership's goal-oriented promotion of advanced experience, achieved a zinc block composition of 99.94%, setting a new national record for horizontal tank zinc smelting and earning commendation from the Central Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration.

The raw material used by the factory for zinc smelting is flotation zinc concentrate, which usually contains between 2% and 4% lead, and also has a high cadmium content, affecting the quality of the zinc blocks. Last year, in order to improve quality, they added salt during sand drying to volatilize the lead as lead chloride; and added pulverized coal for reduction, making the cadmium easily volatilized as metallic cadmium. This method was very good and did not significantly affect product costs, but adopting this method required workers to reform their operating methods.

In April of this year, during discussions on the national plan, after many studies and learning from advanced experiences of other factories, they adopted the methods of frequent cleaning, quick filing, and two-stage furnace cleaning to reduce the phenomenon of sand clumping caused by prolonged shutdowns and to increase the opportunity for ore oxidation. When raising the fire, in addition to adhering to the "thin coal, thin slag" firing method, they also promoted the "small furnace cleaning method" of the First Factory of the Shuikoushan Mining Bureau, so that the furnace temperature was always balanced. When feeding materials, they tried to ensure that the sand was fed evenly and that the sand layer was of uniform thickness. In terms of sand turning, in addition to frequently cleaning the clumping in the circular furnace, promptly repairing and replacing the rake arm and rake teeth to maintain the normal operation of the sand raking machine, they also improved the batching and manual sand turning operation methods, allowing the ore to be fully burned and chlorinated. After adopting a series of new operating methods, by the end of April, the zinc block composition had reached a new record of 99.925% zinc content, and during the Red May competition, it further created a peak record of 99.94%.

The Central Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration has issued a circular of commendation for the achievements made by the factory. Currently, the entire factory's employees are improving some of the furnace's shortcomings during the shutdown for repairs. They expressed that they will further improve the recovery rate in the fourth quarter and strive to make the product quality reach 99.96%.

    湖南水口山矿务局第四厂 
    创全国横罐炼锌新纪录
    湖南水口山矿务局第四厂（炼锌车间）由于工人群众发挥了积极性与创造性，技术人员和工人密切结合，领导方面有目标地推广先进经验，使锌块成份达到百分之九十九点九四，创造了全国横罐炼锌的最高纪录，获得中央有色金属工业管理局的表扬。
    该厂炼锌所采用的原料浮选锌精砂，含铅量通常在百分之二到百分之四之间，含镉量也高，影响锌块品质。去年他们为改进质量曾在烘砂时加入食盐，使铅成为氯化铅挥发；另加柴煤还原，使镉亦成为易于挥发的金属镉。这一办法很好，对产品成本影响也不大，但采用这一办法，必须工人改革操作方法。
    今年四月，该厂在讨论国家计划中，经过许多次的研究和向外厂学习先进经验，他们采用了勤清快锉和两段清炉的办法，减少了因停车过久砂子结块的现象，并且增进了矿砂氧化的机会。在升火时除了坚持“薄煤薄渣”烧火法外，并推广水口山矿务局一厂的“小清炉法”，使炉温经常均衡。进料时，尽量使进砂均匀，砂层厚薄一致。在翻砂方面，除了勤清圆炉的结块，及时修换耙臂耙齿，保持耙砂机的正常运转外，又改进了配料和人工翻砂的操作方法，使矿砂得到充分的燃烧和氯化的机会。采取了一连串的新的操作方法以后，四月底锌块成份已达到含锌量百分之九十九点九二五的新纪录，在红五月竞赛中，进一步创造了百分之九十九点九四的最高纪录。
    中央有色金属工业管理局对该厂所创造的成绩，已予通报表扬。现在，全厂职工在停炉修理中，又改进了炉子的一些缺点，他们表示要在第四季度进一步提高收回率，努力使产品品质达到百分之九十九点九六。
