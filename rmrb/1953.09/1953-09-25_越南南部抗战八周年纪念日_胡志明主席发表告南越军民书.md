Xinhua News Agency, September 24th: According to Vietnam News Agency, September 23rd marks the eighth anniversary of the Southern Vietnamese Resistance War. Ho Chi Minh, President of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, issued a letter to the Southern Vietnamese military and people.

The letter said: On the occasion of the eighth anniversary of the Southern Vietnamese Resistance War, I, on behalf of the Lao Dong Party and the Central Government, extend warm congratulations and regards to the cadres, army, and people of Southern Vietnam.

The heroic battles of the past eight years have proven that Southern Vietnam deserves the title of the motherland's fortress. The people of Southern Vietnam have been and continue to unyieldingly persist in the struggle against the French colonialists, the American interventionists, and their puppets.

After pointing out that Vietnam's long-term resistance war will surely achieve victory, and that the more the enemy fails, the more brutal they become, the letter called on: all the people to unite more closely, launch a production increase competition, and actively participate in the resistance war; the entire army to continuously expand and consolidate the network of guerrilla bases, and strike and eliminate the enemy anytime, anywhere; government and party cadres must further strengthen unity, follow the mass line, and fully implement the policies of the Party and the government; those who have been misled by the enemy should be sincerely explained to and called upon to return to the embrace of the motherland.

The letter concluded: Because the international situation is favorable to us, because our army and people have a high degree of patriotism, and because of the wise leadership of our Party and government, we will surely overcome all kinds of difficulties and achieve complete victory.

Xinhua News Agency, September 24th: Vietnam News Agency published an article commemorating the eighth anniversary of the Southern Vietnamese people's resistance war on September 23rd.

The article discussed the achievements of the Southern Vietnamese people in the past eight years, along with the entire Vietnamese people, in resisting the French aggressors and establishing resistance bases in difficult environments. The article said: Under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, the Southern Vietnamese people have become stronger and achieved significant victories in the past eight years, severely打击ing (dǎjī - hitting, striking) the imperialists and partially thwarting their plans of aggression.

The Southern Vietnamese military and people have been constantly working to build their own armed forces in battle. Previously, the people's armed forces only had some small guerrilla units, but now there are many local force companies and regular army regiments. Guerrilla areas have sprung up like bamboo shoots after rain and gradually formed the huge net that now surrounds the enemy, making them very embarrassed in many areas.

With the assistance of the militia and guerrillas, the People's Army units frequently launch attacks on the enemy forces, keeping most of the enemy forces exhausted. In the first half of 1953, the People's Army in the Southern Vietnamese battlefield killed, wounded, and captured a total of 5,000 enemy soldiers, and seized nearly 1,000 weapons. Good results have also been achieved in disintegrating the enemy forces. In the past few years, three or four thousand puppet soldiers have surrendered to the people. A new change is taking place in the morale of the puppet soldiers in Southern Vietnam.

The article then described the achievements of the Southern Vietnamese people in the political, economic, and cultural fields. The article pointed out: The Southern Vietnamese people's regime and the Lao Dong Party organization pay great attention to leveraging the strength of the peasants. Rent reduction of 25% has been steadily implemented, and more than 251,600 hectares of land have been distributed to poor and landless peasants. Agricultural output is increasing year by year. This year, rice production in many areas has doubled or tripled compared to previous years. The lives of soldiers, workers, and public employees have improved, and most of the former poor peasants have become middle peasants.

The people's cultural demands have also increased. The number of publications this year is two to three times that of previous years. Almost all villages have cultural classes and primary schools.

The people's democratic regime in the countryside is being strengthened on the basis of the worker-peasant alliance.

The article then talked about the heroic struggle of the people in the enemy-occupied areas of Southern Vietnam against the enemy's plunder and forced conscription.

The article emphasized the role of the Southern Vietnamese military and people in the resistance war, saying: The struggle of the Southern Vietnamese military and people has absorbed many of the enemy's forces, creating conditions for the Vietnamese military and people on the main battlefield of Northern Vietnam to gain a military advantage. The article finally pointed out: After the armistice in Korea, U.S. imperialism has been strengthening its intervention in Indochina. Under the orders of U.S. imperialism, the French colonialists and their puppets are trying to use new and more vicious methods to deal with the Southern Vietnamese people. However, the Southern Vietnamese people fully understand the arduousness of the struggle for national independence and freedom and are determined to unite more closely around Chairman Ho Chi Minh and continue to fight in order to defeat the enemy's conspiracy of aggression.

    越南南部抗战八周年纪念日
    胡志明主席发表告南越军民书
    【新华社二十四日讯】据越南通讯社讯：九月二十三日是南越抗战八周年纪念日，越南民主共和国政府胡志明主席特发表告南越军民书。
    告军民书说：值此南越抗战八周年纪念之际，我代表劳动党和中央政府向南越干部、军队和人民表示热烈的祝贺和慰问。
    过去八年的英勇战斗，证明了南越无愧于祖国堡垒的称号；南越人民已经而且还在不屈不挠地坚持着反对法国殖民者、美国干涉者和它们的傀儡的斗争。
    告军民书在指出越南的长期抗战必将取得胜利，而敌人越失败就越残暴后，号召：全体人民更紧密地团结起来，展开增产竞赛并积极参加抗战；全体军队不断扩大和巩固游击基地网，随时随地打击和消灭敌人；政府和党的干部必须进一步加强团结，走群众路线，完全执行党和政府的政策；对被敌人诱入歧途的人，应诚恳地向他们进行解释，号召他们返回祖国的怀抱。
    告军民书最后说：由于国际形势对我们有利，由于我们的军队和人民具有高度的爱国主义精神，由于我们的党和政府的英明领导，我们一定会克服种种困难并取得完全的胜利。
    【新华社二十四日讯】越南通讯社发表文章，纪念九月二十三日南越人民抗战八周年。
    文章论述了南越人民八年来和全体越南人民一道，在抗击法国侵略者和在艰苦环境中建立了抗战根据地的成就。文章说：南越人民八年来在胡志明主席的领导下，已变得更加坚强，取得了重大的胜利，严重打击了帝国主义者并部分粉碎了它们的侵略计划。
    南越军民在战斗中不断努力建立自己的武装。以前，人民武装只有一些小的游击单位，现在已有许多地方部队的连队和正规军的团队了。游击区像雨后春笋一样纷纷兴起，并逐渐形成了现在的围住敌人的巨大的网，使敌人在许多地区非常狼狈。
    人民军部队在民兵和游击队的协助下，经常对敌军发动进攻，使大部分敌军疲于奔命。一九五三年上半年，人民军在南越战场上一共毙、伤、俘敌军五千人，缴获近一千件武器。在瓦解敌军方面也取得了良好成绩，过去几年中归顺人民的伪军有三四千人。在南越的伪军士气正在发生新的变化。
    文章随着叙述了南越人民在政治、经济、文化各方面的成就。文章指出：南越人民政权和劳动党组织非常注意发挥农民的力量。二五减租已在稳步实行，已有二十五万一千六百多公顷的土地分给贫苦和无地农民。农业产量一年比一年增加，今年许多地区的大米产量已为往年的二倍或三倍。军队、工人和公教人员的生活得到了改善，以前的贫农大部分已上升为中农。
    人民在文化方面的要求也增加了。今年出版物的数量为往年的两倍到三倍。差不多全部的村庄都设有文化班和小学校。
    农村的人民民主政权在工农联盟的基础上正日益加强。
    文章接着谈到南越敌占区人民反对敌人掠夺和强迫征兵的英勇斗争。
    文章着重指出南越军民在抗战中的作用说：由于南越军民的斗争，吸住了敌人的许多兵力，给北越主要战场上的越南军民创造了取得军事优势的条件。文章最后指出：在朝鲜停战后，美帝国主义已在加强对印度支那的干涉。在美帝国主义的命令下，法国殖民者及其傀儡正在设法用新的和更加毒辣的方法来对付南越人民。但是，南越人民充分了解到争取民族独立和自由的斗争的艰苦性，决心更加紧密地团结在胡志明主席周围，继续战斗，以便击败敌人的侵略阴谋。
