    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 28th: (Dispatch from our special correspondent) The U.S. side is now attempting to continue delaying the explanatory work and openly threatening to instigate Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee bandit gang special agents to stage so-called "riots" to sabotage the explanatory work on a large scale.
    Hamblen, commander of the U.S. repatriation group, wrote a letter to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on the 27th, demanding that the explanatory work should end on December 23rd. In other words, he demanded that the date of commencement of the explanatory work should be counted from September 25th, and that the days delayed due to U.S. obstruction should be included in the ninety days of explanatory work. In effect, this is to shorten the duration of the explanatory work. In his letter, Hamblen also stated that he was not satisfied with the facilities established by the Korean and Chinese side in the camps for non-directly repatriated U.S. prisoners of war for carrying out the explanatory work, and demanded that these facilities be improved. In fact, the Korean and Chinese side prepared five houses and tents for the explanatory work, with an average of about seventy prisoners of war per house; while the U.S. side only prepared sixteen tents, with an average of about one thousand four hundred prisoners of war per tent, which of course increased the difficulty of the explanatory work. Therefore, it is obviously the U.S. side that should improve the facilities, not the Korean and Chinese side. Hamblen's unreasonable demand is nothing more than an attempt to create an excuse to delay the start of the explanatory work, so as to further shorten the duration.
    At the same time, as the date scheduled for the start of the explanatory work approached, the U.S. side more openly used intimidation and threats to put pressure on the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, attempting to force the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to accept its unreasonable demand that so-called "prisoners of war can individually or collectively refuse to accept explanation." The Associated Press reported on the 28th that "As the date for the start of the explanatory work draws nearer, the Allied officers express fear that disturbances will occur." These officers are "worried" that if prisoners of war are forced to listen to the explanations of the Korean and Chinese explanation representatives, then many so-called "anti-communist prisoners of war" "may take violent actions, or even escape collectively."
    In fact, the so-called "worry" and "fear" of these "Allied officers" are all pretentious. The "riot" plans of those special agents pretending to be "anti-communist prisoners of war" were formulated under the guidance and planning of these officers. Personnel who had already broken through special agent control in the Indian forces' detention camps and returned reported unanimously that when they were still in the U.S. prisoner of war camps in Busan or Jeju Island, the Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee bandit gang special agents in these prisoner of war camps had all received maps of the Indian forces' detention camps from the U.S. side. The map clearly showed the camp location, the defensive situation of the Indian forces; on the south side of the camp, it also marked the positions of three divisions of the U.S. military and the Rhee puppet army, drawing symbols of artillery, tanks, and airplanes. These returning personnel had all heard a lecture by an American general at the end of August and the beginning of September this year. The American general told the prisoners of war to rush out of the Indian forces' detention camps when necessary, and told them that the U.S. military had deployed strong positions near the Indian camps, and a large number of airplanes, artillery, and tanks were ready to meet them at any time.
    As long as the U.S. threats are compared with the facts revealed by the returning personnel, it can be seen how sinister and malicious the U.S. intentions are. They are afraid that the prisoners of war will demand repatriation after receiving the explanation, and their conspiracy to forcibly detain the prisoners of war will completely fail. Therefore, they attempt to use special agents to force the prisoners of war to refuse to accept the explanation. If this trick fails, they will have the special agents coerce the prisoners of war to rush out of the prisoner of war camps, so that the explanation work will be completely sabotaged. People here pointed out that the U.S. conspiracy has now been fully exposed and should arouse serious vigilance. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission now has the responsibility to quickly take all effective measures to prevent the realization of this U.S. conspiracy, in order to ensure the smooth progress of the explanatory work.

### 美方公开对中立国遣返委员会施加压力  企图拖延解释工作并利用特务进行破坏

    美方公开对中立国遣返委员会施加压力
    企图拖延解释工作并利用特务进行破坏
    【新华社开城二十八日电】本社特派记者报道：美方现在企图继续拖延解释工作的进行，并公然恫吓要鼓动国民党和李承晚匪帮特务举行所谓“暴动”来大规模破坏解释工作。
    美方遣返组司令汉布伦在二十七日写信给中立国遣返委员会，要求解释工作应在十二月二十三日结束，换句话说，他要求将解释工作开始的日期从九月二十五日算起，并把因美方阻挠而延期的日子都算在进行解释工作的九十天之内，实际上就是要缩短解释工作的期限。汉布伦在他的信中还说，他不满意朝中方面在收容不直接遣返的美方战俘的营地内为进行解释工作而建立的设备，要求改进这些设备。事实上，朝中方面为进行解释工作而准备了五所房屋和帐篷，平均大约七十名战俘就有一所；而美方只准备了十六所帐篷，平均大约一千四百名战俘才有一所，这当然增加了解释工作的困难。因此，应该改进设备的显然不是朝中方面而是美方。汉布伦提出这样一个无理要求，无非是企图制造藉口，以便拖延解释工作的开始，达到他的进一步缩短解释期限的目的。
    同时，随着预定开始解释工作的日期的迫近，美方更加公开地用恫吓和威胁来对中立国遣返委员会施加压力，企图迫使中立国遣返委员会接受它的所谓“战俘可以个别或集体拒绝接受解释”的无理要求。美联社在二十八日报道说：“开始进行解释工作的日期已越来越近，联军军官们表示害怕将发生骚动。”这些军官们“担心”，如果强迫战俘们听取朝中解释代表的解释，那末许多所谓“反共战俘”“可能采取暴力行动，或者甚至于集体逃跑”。
    其实，这些“联军军官们”的所谓“担心”和“害怕”全是装腔作势，那些装作“反共战俘”的特务分子的“暴动”计划，就是在这些军官们的指导和策划下拟订出来的。已经在印度部队看管营地突破特务控制而遣返回来的人员一致报告说，当他们还在釜山或济州岛美方战俘营中的时候，这些战俘营中的国民党和李承晚匪帮的特务，都从美方得到了印度部队看管营地的地图。地图上清楚地标示着营场位置，印度部队设防情况；在营地南面，还标示着美军和李伪军三个师的阵地，画着大炮、坦克、飞机的符号。这些归来人员在今年八月底九月初都曾听过一个美国将军的训话，这个美国将军要战俘们在必要时冲出印度部队看管营地，并且告诉他们说，美军已在印度营地附近布下强大的阵地，大批飞机、大炮、坦克，随时都准备着接应他们。
    只要把美方的恫吓和归来人员所揭露的事实对照一下，就可以看出，美方的用心是多么阴险和恶毒，他们害怕战俘在接受解释以后要求遣返，使他们强迫扣留战俘的阴谋彻底失败，因此他们企图利用特务来强迫战俘拒绝接受解释，如果这一着不能成功，他们就要特务胁迫战俘冲出战俘营，使解释工作完全遭到破坏。此间人士指出，美方的这一阴谋现在已经充分暴露，应该引起人们的严重警惕。中立国遣返委员会现在有责任迅速采取一切有效措施，防止美方这个阴谋的实现，以保证解释工作的顺利进行。
