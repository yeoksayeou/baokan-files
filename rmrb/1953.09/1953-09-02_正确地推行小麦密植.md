    Correctly Promote Close Planting of Wheat

    Close planting of wheat is the most economical and effective method to strive for increased wheat production under China's current conditions. To promote this method, it is not necessary to increase investment too much or spend too much manpower. It only requires slightly more seeds and using wider sowing widths or adding more sowing rows to distribute the seeds more evenly, which can greatly increase wheat production. In recent years, state-owned farms and agricultural experiment stations in the suburbs of Beijing have densely planted wheat and achieved continuous increases in production. Areas that correctly promoted close planting of wheat in the autumn sowing of 1952 also had good harvests this year. Even in areas where wheat suffered from frost damage, closely planted wheat had stronger resistance to disasters. All of this proves the benefits of close planting of wheat. This is a gratifying achievement in learning from Soviet experience on the agricultural production front and summarizing and promoting the existing farming experience among the Chinese people under the guidance of advanced Soviet agricultural scientific thought. It is a significant advancement in agricultural technology in China. On the agricultural production front, in addition to continuing to earnestly implement various policies for developing agricultural production, improving agricultural production technology on the basis of existing possible conditions is of great significance for increasing the yield of crops. We should not neglect this point in the slightest.

    In the past year, we have gained some important experience in implementing and promoting close planting. However, it must be recognized that the promotion of any new agricultural technology must take into account the characteristics of the small-peasant economy, the vastness of China, and the extremely uneven social conditions, natural conditions, and agricultural technology levels. Therefore, we must adopt the principle of first making good examples, achieving increased production results, and then gradually promoting them. As long as we adhere to this principle, farmers are happy to accept new technologies. The promotion of close planting of wheat is no exception. Last year, in launching the wheat production increase challenge competition, some areas subjectively stipulated the proportion of wheat fields to be densely planted without regard to local specific conditions; even forcibly stipulated the amount of seeds to be sown per unit area, requiring farmers to sow according to so-called "scientific standards." This was obviously inappropriate. It must be understood that the original farm tools, soil, climate, varieties, farming systems, etc., are different in different regions. To implement close planting, each region has some specific problems that need to be solved through repeated experiments and research. Before the majority of farmers have practical experience in close planting and increasing production, what the masses first consider is whether close planting will reduce production instead. For the sake of a year's life, farmers are unwilling to take the "risk" of using farming methods they have not experienced without a reliable guarantee. In this case, to force the "completion of the close planting task" will lead to coercive orders, false reports of densely planted areas, and formalism such as "dense planting by the roadside, not dense in the fields."

    On the other hand, it is also wrong to take a passive laissez-faire attitude towards close planting of wheat. Some people believe that close planting is a foreign experience, and they have a mysterious or fearful mentality towards it. In fact, although the scientific principles of close planting are foreign, the facts of close planting exist among the masses in various parts of China, but they are still individual or accidental and have not been systematically summarized. Each region or its neighboring regions has examples of relatively dense planting and relatively high yield. If we have a correct understanding and a correct attitude towards close planting, we should cherish these examples and earnestly summarize and promote them. In particular, after a year of promotion last year, various places have more practical experience in close planting and increasing production, and more people have personally seen the fact that close planting increases production. Statements such as "close planting is prone to lodging," "close planting is prone to infection with yellow rust," and "dry and thin land cannot be closely planted" have been fully proven by practice to be misconceptions, subjective assumptions of people who do not correctly and comprehensively understand the content of close planting, and have no scientific basis. At the same time, through opposing blind advancement, opposing "five excesses," and publicizing various policies related to agricultural production, and this year the farmers have once again more accurately seen the fact that increased production does not increase the burden in the summer harvest, the enthusiasm of the farmers to improve technology and increase production has been improved. These are all favorable conditions for further promoting close planting of wheat.

    In many areas with backward cultivation, wheat is still sown by broadcasting. In these places, narrow-row drilling should be promoted first. Agricultural production leaders in these places should not lose interest in preliminary improvements because there are more advanced farming methods. In areas where wheat planting technology is relatively advanced, one should not be satisfied with "already dense enough" and stop moving forward. The experience of Wugong County, Shaanxi Province, has proven that there is still a broad prospect for increasing wheat production in such areas. To achieve high density planting of wheat, we should also strive to improve in terms of deep plowing, fertilization, and fine selection of varieties, and we can gradually improve and promote crop rotation and fallowing cropping systems. Close attention should also be paid to variety selection and disease prevention. Otherwise, simply adding more seeds may not necessarily guarantee a sufficient number of plants per unit area. In the past, some places blindly cited foreign varieties that were not suitable for local growth; or brought in pests and diseases that were not originally present locally. Attention should also be paid to this aspect this year. The principle of selecting and promoting excellent varieties locally should be followed; for foreign varieties, they must be promoted only after farm trials have proven that they are suitable for local conditions.

    Wheat is one of China's main commercial grains. With the progress of industrial construction and the improvement of the living standards of urban and rural people, the demand for wheat is increasing day by day. Increasing wheat production is of great significance for improving and stabilizing the normal relationship between urban and rural areas. According to rough statistics based on existing materials, correct implementation of close planting can generally increase production by about 20% compared to the original sparse planting. If all the wheat fields in the country are densely planted, the increased wheat alone can exceed the current amount of commercial wheat. In the past, many places neglected the production of miscellaneous grains, which was wrong; now, we should not inappropriately expand the area of wheat fields. Therefore, it is even more important to correctly promote close planting to increase the yield of wheat per unit area. Before the autumn harvest, the leading organs in wheat-producing areas should make all preparations for sowing winter wheat. In many areas where wheat has suffered from disasters this year, special attention should be paid to preparing enough seeds suitable for local conditions to meet the needs of close planting. More attention should be paid to summarizing local existing experience in close planting of wheat, and key techniques of close planting should be taught to grassroots cadres and activists. They must correctly and comprehensively grasp the two basic contents of close planting (increasing the number of plants per unit area, and striving to evenly distribute the seeds) and the methods of promoting advanced technology under the conditions of the small-peasant economy, so as to avoid the mistakes that have occurred in the past, and lay a more solid foundation for gradually expanding the area of close planting of wheat in the coming year.

### 正确地推行小麦密植

    正确地推行小麦密植
    小麦密植是在我国目前条件下争取小麦增产的最经济最有效的方法。推行这个方法，不必增加太多投资，不必多费很多人工，只是稍多用一些种籽，用加宽播幅或加多播种行列的办法使种籽散布得比较均匀，就能够增产不少麦子。北京市郊各国营农场和农业试验所近几年来密植小麦，达到连年增产；一九五二年秋季播种时正确地推行了密植小麦的地区，今年收成也都很好；就是在小麦遭受霜灾的地区，密植的小麦抗灾的能力也比较强。这都证明了小麦密植的好处。这是我国农业生产战线上学习苏联经验，并在苏联先进的农业科学思想指导下总结和推广我国群众中已有的耕作经验得到的一项值得欢欣的成果，是我国农业技术上一个巨大的进步。在农业生产战线上，除应继续认真贯彻各种发展农业生产的政策外，在现有可能的条件基础上，改进农业生产技术，对于提高农作物的产量，具有重大的意义。我们对于这一点丝毫也不应忽视。
    过去一年里，我们已取得了实行密植和推广密植的若干重要经验。但是必须认识到，推广任何新的农业技术，都必须照顾小农经济的特点，必须照顾我国地域广大、社会条件、自然条件和农业技术水平都极不平衡的特点，因此都必须采取先作好样子，取得增产成效，然后逐步推广的方针。只要我们坚持这个方针，农民对新技术是乐于接受的。推广小麦密植也不能例外。去年在发动小麦增产挑战竞赛中，有的地区不根据当地的具体条件，主观地规定了密植的小麦要达到全部麦田的比例数字；甚至硬性地规定了单位面积的播种量，要农民按所谓“科学标准”播种。这样做显然是不适当的。必须了解，各地原有的农具不同，土壤、气候、品种、耕作制度等都各不相同。要实行密植，各地都有些具体问题尚待通过反复试验研究求得解决。在大部地区的农民群众还没有密植增产的实际经验的时候，要群众普遍实行密植，群众首先要考虑的是密植会不会反而减产。农民为了一年的生活，没有确实可靠的保证，是不肯担着“风险”使用自己没有经历过的耕作方法的。在这情况下，要强求“完成密植任务”，就会发生强迫命令、假报密植面积和“路边密、田间不密”之类的形式主义的现象。
    另一方面，对于小麦密植抱消极的放任自流的态度也是不对的。有人认为密植是外来的经验，就对它产生了一种神秘的或畏惧的心理。其实，密植的科学道理虽是外来的，密植的事实则是在我国各地群众中都存在的，只不过还是个别的或偶然的，没有加以系统的总结。每个地区或它的附近地区，都有比较密植而比较多产的事例。如果我们对于密植有正确的认识、正确的态度，就应该珍视这些事例，认真地加以总结和推广。特别是经过去年一年的推广，各地已经有了更多的密植增产的实际经验，已经有更多群众亲眼看到了密植增产的事实。“密植容易倒伏”、“密植容易感染黄锈病”“旱地薄地不能密植”等等说法，已被实践充分地证明了是一种错觉，是没有正确地全面地了解密植的内容的人们的主观臆断，是没有科学根据的。同时经过反对盲目冒进、反对“五多”和宣传有关农业生产的各项政策，且在今年夏征中农民群众又一次更确切地看到了增产不增负担的事实，农民群众改进技术、增加生产的积极性已经提高。这些都是进一步推行小麦密植的有利条件。
    在许多耕作落后的地区，种麦还是用撒播的方法。在这些地方，当前首先要提倡窄行条播。这些地方的农业生产领导者不能因为有更先进的耕作方法就对初步的改进不感兴趣。在种麦技术比较先进的地区，不应满足于“已经够密了”，不再继续前进。陕西武功县的经验就证明了，在这样的地区，增产小麦还是有广阔前途的。要做到小麦的高度密植，还应当从深耕、施肥、精选品种等方面力求改进，并可以逐步改进和推广轮作、倒茬的耕作制度。对于选种、防治病害等方面也应密切注意。不然，只是加多种籽，还不一定能够保证单位面积上有足够的株数。过去有些地方因盲目引用外来品种，不适合当地生长；或者带来了本地原来所没有的病虫害。今年在这方面也应当注意，优良品种应以就地选取，就地推广为原则；对于外来品种，必须经过农场试验证明确能适合当地条件才能推广。
    小麦是我国的主要商品粮食之一。随着工业建设的进展和城乡人民生活的改善，小麦的需要量正日渐增加。增产小麦对于改进和稳定城乡之间的正常关系有重要的意义。根据现有材料粗略地统计，正确实行密植比原来稀植的一般可以增产百分之二十左右。如果全国的麦田都实行了密植，只是增产的麦子就可以超过现在的小麦商品额。过去不少地方忽视杂粮生产，是不对的；现在也不应不适当地扩大麦田面积。因此，正确推行密植以提高小麦的单位面积产量就更加重要了。秋收以前，产麦地区的领导机关应当为播种冬小麦作好一切准备工作。在许多地区今年小麦受了灾害的情况下，特别要注意准备足够的适合当地条件的种籽，以备密植之需。更应注意总结当地已有的小麦密植经验，有重点地向基层干部和积极分子传授密植技术。要使他们正确地全面地掌握密植的两个基本内容（加多单位面积株数，同时力求使种籽均匀分布）和在小农经济的条件下推广先进技术的方法，以避免过去曾经发生的错误，在今后一年间为逐步扩大小麦密植面积打下更稳固的基础。
