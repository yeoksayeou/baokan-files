    Shanghai Public Security Bureau Arrests Imperialist Element Luo Zhangda

    Based on materials confirmed by long-term investigation, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau cracked a case on August 26 involving the imperialist element Luo Zhangda, who was using the Catholic Little Brothers of the Mother Mary to conduct sabotage activities. The main culprit, Luo Zhangda (Robbe Gabriel, French national, Provincial Superior and Provincial Accountant and First Provincial Councilor of the Little Brothers of the Mother Mary in China), was arrested. The Municipal Public Security Bureau will, after interrogation, submit the case to the Shanghai Military Control Commission of the Chinese People's Liberation Army for punishment according to law.

    Luo Zhangda came to China in 1907. For a long time, he used the "Little Brothers of the Mother Mary" as the core to control church schools in Beijing, Tianjin, Qingdao, Shanghai, Wuhan, Chongqing and other places, carrying out cultural aggression and other conspiratorial activities against our country.

    In November 1948, Luo went to Shanghai. After the liberation of Shanghai, he launched a series of sabotage activities, deploying and dispatching henchmen to lie dormant in various places. He instructed his trusted henchman Liu, in Xishiku, Beijing, to take on "important responsibilities" and continue to carry out undercover activities "in secular clothing." He sent his confidant Wu Youjun to Xikang, Chongqing, Guizhou and other places to carry out activities. Luo attempted to use the former Shanghai St. Francis Xavier's General and Branch Schools as strongholds against the Chinese people. Luo Zhangda sent Chiang Kai-shek's "Military Intelligence Bureau" agent Bai Yuheng (already arrested) to serve as the principal of St. Francis Xavier's General School under the guise of a "Little Brother of the Mother Mary," and sent reactionary element Liang Guangyi (already arrested) to be the director of the branch school; he also gathered some saboteurs to carry out destruction in a hidden way. They organized a reactionary "Legion of Mary" in the school to engage in anti-people activities. Members of the "Legion of Mary" infiltrated the student union to undermine the patriotic student movement. In April 1950, they incited members of the "Legion of Mary," Gu Xi'an and Jiang Zuhua, to go to Taiwan via Hong Kong to receive special agent training, in order to return to the mainland to carry out espionage activities; before their departure, Luo Zhangda also helped them to obtain Hong Kong entry permits. In October 1951, when the Military Control Commission ordered the banning of the reactionary organization "Legion of Mary," Luo Zhangda not only obstructed the registration of the "Legion of Mary" members under his control, but also ordered them to change their name to "Catechism Group" to continue their sabotage activities.

    On the eve of Shanghai's liberation, Luo hid firearms in the mezzanine between the second and third floors of the former St. Francis Xavier's Foreign School. After liberation, Luo destroyed a batch of weapons and hid them at the bottom of a well in the yard. This batch of weapons has been seized by our Public Security Bureau, including: a Winchester .44 caliber repeating rifle, a St. Etienne rifle, a 7.9 rifle, a Browning pistol, two revolvers, as well as a large number of bullets of various calibers and a damaged telecommunications device.

    In order to raise funds for conspiratorial sabotage activities, Luo Zhangda also illegally operated an inland river shipping company in our country. In 1951, Luo ordered Little Brother of the Mother Mary Fu Cizhu (detained) to pull Zhao Kangtai to come forward and jointly open the "Liangliu Inland River Shipping Company" in Nantong County, Jiangsu Province. Luo invested more than 80 million yuan, accounting for two-thirds of the company's funds. In addition, Luo also invested heavily in the Kunshan Xiangxing Shipping Company, and sent Little Brother of the Mother Mary Wang Ping to be the accountant, and later wanted to send Bai Yuheng to be the manager, attempting to infiltrate the business community and use this as a cover to expand the scope of sabotage activities.

    The Shanghai Public Security Bureau has long had conclusive evidence, both human and material, of Luo's above-mentioned crimes. In order to eliminate imperialist elements and other counter-revolutionary elements lurking in Catholicism, the Municipal Public Security Bureau promptly cracked this case. The cracking of this case once again proves the fact that imperialist elements use Catholicism in many ways to carry out conspiracies and sabotage activities, and shows people the ugly face of the "Legion of Mary" and its reactionary essence.

    上海市人民政府公安局逮捕帝国主义分子罗璋达
    上海市人民政府公安局根据长期侦察所证实的材料，在八月二十六日破获了以帝国主义分子罗璋达为首利用天主教圣母小昆仲会进行阴谋破坏活动案，捕获主犯罗璋达（Robbe    Gabriel，法国籍，圣母小昆仲会中国省会长兼省会计及第一省议士）。市公安局将在审讯后提请中国人民解放军上海市军事管制委员会依法惩处。
    罗璋达于一九○七年来中国。他长期利用“圣母小昆仲会”为核心，控制北京、天津、青岛、上海、武汉、重庆等地教会学校，对我国进行文化侵略及其他阴谋活动。
    一九四八年十一月，罗犯去上海。上海解放后他展开了一系列的阴谋破坏活动，布置和派遣爪牙潜伏各地。他指示在北京西什库的亲信爪牙刘某负起“重要的责任”，“在世俗的服装下”继续进行潜伏活动。他派遣心腹吴酉俊去西康、重庆、贵州等地进行活动。罗犯企图以上海前圣芳济总、分校作为对抗中国人民的据点。罗璋达派了蒋匪“军统”特务白玉珩（已逮捕）以小昆仲会“修士”的名义担任了圣芳济总校校长，派反动分子梁广义（已逮捕）为分校主任；还纠合了一部分破坏分子以隐蔽活动方式进行破坏。在学校中组织反动“圣母军”，从事反人民勾当。“圣母军”分子打入学生会，破坏学生爱国运动。一九五○年四月唆使“圣母军”分子顾西安、江祖华经香港去台湾受特务训练，以便重回大陆进行特务活动；临行，罗璋达还为他们设法办理香港入境手续。一九五一年十月，军管会命令取缔反动组织“圣母军”时，罗璋达不仅阻挠其掌握下的“圣母军”分子登记，并令他们改以“教理小组”名义，继续从事破坏活动。
    上海解放前夕，罗犯在前圣芳济外侨中学内二楼和三楼之间的夹墙中藏存枪枝。解放后，罗犯把一批武器破坏后隐藏在院子里的井底。这批武器已经由我公安局抄获，计有：温却斯咸四四口径连发枪、圣爱几尼来复枪、七九步枪、勃朗宁枪各一枝，转轮手枪二枝，以及大量各式口径的子弹和一部已被破坏的电讯器具。
    罗璋达为了筹集阴谋破坏活动的经费，还在我国非法经营内河轮船公司。一九五一年罗犯令小昆仲会修士傅辞筑（已扣押）拉赵康泰出面，在江苏省南通县与人合伙开设“良流内河航运公司”，罗犯投资八千多万元，占该公司资金三分之二。另外罗犯在崑山祥兴轮船公司也大量投资，并派遣小昆仲会修士王萍前去当账房，后又想派白玉珩去当经理，妄图打入工商界并以此为掩护扩大破坏活动的范围。
    罗犯以上罪行，上海市公安局早已掌握有确凿的人证物证。为了肃清潜藏在天主教里的帝国主义分子和其他反革命分子，市公安局及时地破获了这个案件。这一案件的破获又一次证明了帝国主义分子从多方面利用天主教进行阴谋破坏活动的事实，让人们看到了“圣母军”的丑恶面目和它的反动本质。
