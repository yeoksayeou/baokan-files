    Xinhua News Agency, 13th: The CCP Central Committee North China Bureau convened the North China region's industrial work conference from August 26th to September 7th. The conference reviewed the completion of the North China region's industrial production plan for the first half of the year, and focused on studying specific measures to strive to overfulfill the national plan and increase production and conserve huge amounts of wealth for the country. More than 40 people attended the meeting, including the industrial ministers of the Inner Mongolia-Suiyuan Sub-bureau and the provincial and municipal Party committees, the directors of the provincial and municipal People's Government industrial departments and bureaus, the directors of the North China-level specialized bureaus, and the heads of trade unions.

    The meeting considered that the production plans of most factories and mines in the North China region this year were relatively practical, and the actual production value in the first half of this year increased by 34.72 percent compared with the same period last year. There has also been great progress in production management compared with the past. However, the national plan has still not been fully completed. The region as a whole only completed just over 97 percent of the national plan in the first half of the year, and 45.8 percent of the annual plan. Of the 97 major products in the region, only 56 completed the plan.

    The meeting demanded that the Party committees of the subordinate provinces and cities concentrate their efforts to strengthen specific leadership over factories and mines, and place the work of leading each factory and mine to strive to overfulfill the national plan on the Party's most important agenda; conscientiously help each factory and mine to check the reasons for not completing the plan, and help them formulate practical and feasible plans for increasing production and economizing. Each factory and mine should take the organization of the Chinese Communist Party as the core, organize and mobilize all employees to strive for the comprehensive completion of the national plan and the plan for increasing production and economizing. In the struggle to strive for the comprehensive completion of the national plan, each factory and mine must promote decisive advanced experience according to different circumstances, conscientiously implement the suggestions of Soviet experts, carry out the rationalization proposal movement, and implement operating procedures. When each factory and mine is doing the above work, it should pay attention to mobilizing employees and technical personnel to combine labor and technology. And it is necessary to avoid the phenomenon of simply increasing labor intensity and increasing output, while ignoring safety and product quality.

    The meeting also proposed that all current production reform work in each factory and mine should be conducive to the central task of overfulfilling the national plan. Because the industrial development in the North China region is extremely uneven, requirements should be put forward for the production reform of each factory according to different categories. All state-owned factories and mines should implement the requirements of the central ministries and concretize them according to the characteristics of the factory. Regarding local state-owned factories and mines, all those with relatively fixed products, normal supply and marketing, relatively stable technology, quota systems, and a certain foundation in enterprise management should focus on implementing planned management and promoting operation plans as the central content of production reform. All factories and mines with serious quality problems and very unstable technology should focus on solving technical quality problems. All factories and mines that have not completed the rectification task should focus on establishing necessary systems.

    During the meeting, Liu Lantao, the third secretary of the CCP Central Committee North China Bureau, gave important instructions. He asked Party organizations at all levels to conscientiously study and strengthen specific leadership over industry. He pointed out that the Party committees of each province and city must strengthen the political and ideological leadership of the Party in factories and mines, ensure that the idea of comprehensively completing the national plan is implemented in every employee, and make it the idea of all workers and all cadres.

    The meeting was concluded by Comrade Liu Xiufeng. He emphasized that this year is the first year that the people of the whole country are jubilantly implementing the Five-Year Plan, and the industrial production in the North China region must complete the plan. The Party organizations and all employees in the North China region must strive to comprehensively complete the annual industrial production plan.

    Xinhua News Agency, 14th: First-level organs in North China are actively taking effective measures to vigorously practice economy and tighten expenditures in order to concentrate forces to ensure the completion of the country's major construction projects. Wang Congwu, the second deputy secretary of the CCP Central Committee North China Bureau, gave a report on vigorously practicing economy to more than 1,000 cadres of the subordinate organs on the 11th. Wang Congwu called on Party member cadres to take various measures to implement the policy of economy, to save everything that can be saved, and not to ask the central government for money if it can be solved by themselves. It is necessary to further cultivate a good style of thrift in the organs through savings in various aspects, so that our country's financial resources can be concentrated on industrial construction.

    The organs have now taken enthusiastic action and have successively held meetings to study further tightening various expenditures and formulate specific methods for vigorously practicing economy. The administrative department of the CCP Central Committee North China Bureau re-examined the budget plan, reduced and curtailed some expenditures that must be done but can be delayed, and can save more than 160 million yuan by the end of this year. Due to the mobilization being deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, all departments, whether cadres or public service personnel, have expressed their determination to better complete their work tasks with creative labor and ensure the realization of the savings plan. Many cooks in the canteen voluntarily proposed to cherish every grain of rice and improve the life of the organs and protect the health of the staff on the basis of economy. The North China Administrative Committee was reported to all staff by Vice Chairman Zhang Su, and the General Office also convened an enlarged office meeting and decided on ten regulations for the organs to vigorously practice economy, including: expenses that can be paid or not paid in the organ's funds will resolutely not be paid; correct the practice of equal distribution and equal receipt of office supplies; public property should be responsibly cherished, extend the period of use, and prevent damage; save water, electricity, and coal; regularly clean up inventory to make the best use of everything, and everything that can be substituted should be substituted as much as possible, and everything that can be repaired should be used as much as possible to reduce expenditures. The North China Military Region organized cadres to study Lenin, Stalin, and Chairman Mao's essays on economy in order to understand the political and economic significance of economy for national construction. All commanders and fighters of the military region firmly stated that they would strengthen the overall concept, cherish public property, reduce expenditures, and assume more responsibility for ensuring national construction. Mass organizations in North China have also reduced their budgets, and the mere slowdown of dormitory construction can save 2.4 billion yuan. The North China Federation of Trade Unions can save 810 million yuan after careful calculation. In addition to formulating an organ savings plan, the North China Cooperative General Agency also plans to instruct cooperative societies at all levels in the region to quickly formulate plans to implement the policy of increasing production and practicing economy from the perspective of business operations.

    Many units have proposed to reduce the consumption of refined grains and increase the consumption of coarse grains to save refined grains, and have proposed to save one or two taels of rice per person per day to support the masses in disaster areas and help them overcome their current difficulties.

    中共中央华北局召开工业工作会议
    布置全区工业增产节约的工作
    华北一级机关采取措施厉行节约紧缩开支
   【新华社十三日讯】中共中央华北局在八月二十六日到九月七日召开了华北区的工业工作会议。会上检查了华北区上半年工业生产计划完成的情况，并且着重研究了关于争取超额完成国家计划和为国家增产节约巨额财富的具体措施。参加会议的有蒙绥分局和各省、市委的工业部长，省、市人民政府工业厅厅长、局长，华北级各专业局长、工会负责人等四十多人。
    会议认为华北区大部分厂矿今年的生产计划订得比较切实，今年上半年实际的生产价值比去年同期增加了百分之三十四点七二。在生产管理上也比过去大有进步。但仍没有全面完成国家计划。全区上半年只完成国家计划的百分之九十七强，完成全年计划的百分之四十五点八，全区九十七种主要产品，只有五十六种完成计划。
    会议要求所属各省、市党委集中全力加强对工厂矿山的具体领导，把领导各厂矿争取超额完成国家计划的工作，放在党的最主要的议事日程上；认真帮助各厂矿检查没有完成计划的原因，并帮助他们制订出切实可行的增产节约计划。各厂矿要以中国共产党的组织为核心，组织和动员全体职工为全面完成国家计划和增产节约计划而努力。各厂矿在争取全面完成国家计划的斗争中，要根据不同情况，推广有决定性的先进经验，认真执行苏联专家的建议，开展合理化建议运动，贯彻操作规程。各厂矿在做以上工作时，要注意发动职员和技术人员，使劳动与技术结合。并且要避免单纯提高劳动强度和提高产量，而忽视安全和产品质量的现象。
    会议还提出：各厂矿当前的一切生产改革工作，都要有利于超额完成国家计划这一中心任务。因为华北区工业发展极不平衡，对各厂生产改革，应分类提出要求。凡是国营厂矿都应执行中央各部的要求并按本厂的特点加以具体化。关于地方国营厂矿，凡是产品比较固定，供销较正常，技术较稳定，有定额制度，企业管理有一定基础的厂矿，都应以实行计划管理，推行作业计划为生产改革的中心内容。凡是质量问题严重，技术很不稳定的厂矿，都应以解决技术质量问题为中心。凡是未完成整顿任务的厂矿，都以建立必要的制度为中心。
    会议期间，中共中央华北局第三书记刘澜涛作了重要指示。他要求各级中共党的组织认真钻研，加强对工业的具体领导。他指出：各省、市党委必须加强党在厂矿中的政治思想领导，保证全面完成国家计划的思想贯彻到每个职工群众中去，使之成为全体工人、全体干部的思想。
    会议最后由刘秀峰同志作结论。他强调指出：今年是全国人民欢欣鼓舞地执行五年计划的第一年，华北区工业生产必须完成计划。华北区党的组织和全体职工，必须为全面完成全年的工业生产计划而奋斗。
  【新华社十四日讯】华北一级机关，积极采取有效措施，厉行节约、紧缩开支，以集中力量保证完成国家的主要建设事业。中共中央华北局第二副书记王从吾在十一日向所属各机关干部一千余人做了厉行节约的报告。王从吾号召党员干部要采取各种办法来贯彻节约的方针，凡是能够节约的要节约下来，凡是能够自己解决的就不向中央要钱，要从各方面的节约中进一步培养机关俭朴的良好风气，这样才能使我们国家的财力集中在工业建设上来。
    各机关现在已经热烈地行动起来，先后都开会研究再行紧缩各项开支，制订厉行节约的具体办法。中共中央华北局行政部门，重新审查了预算计划，减缩了一些须办而可延缓的开支，到今年年底，共可节约一亿六千多万元。由于动员的深入人心，各部门不论干部公勤人员，都表示要以创造性的劳动更好地完成工作任务，保证节约计划的实现。食堂的许多炊事员自动提出要爱惜一粥一饭，在节约的基础上改善机关生活，保护工作人员的健康。华北行政委员会由副主席张苏向全体工作人员做了报告，办公厅还召集了扩大厅务会议，决定了机关厉行节约的十项规定，其中规定：机关经费中凡可开支可不开支的款项，坚决不开支；在办公用具方面纠正平均分配、平均领取的做法；对公共财物，应负责地加以爱护，延长使用期，防止损坏；节省水、电、用煤；定期清理库存，务使物尽其用，一切器具物品，能代用的尽量代用，能修理的尽量利用，以减少开支。华北军区曾组织干部学习列宁、斯大林和毛主席有关节约的论文，以体会节约对于国家建设的政治意义和经济意义。军区全体指挥员和战士坚决表示要加强整体观念，爱护公物，减少开支，为保障国家建设尽更多的责任。华北各群众团体也都削减了预算，只缓建宿舍一项就可节省二十四亿元。华北总工会经过精打细算，可节约八亿一千万元。华北区合作总社除制订了机关节约计划外，并准备指示全区各级合作社，迅速订出计划，从业务工作上贯彻增产节约方针。
    许多单位提出减食细粮，增食粗粮，以节省细粮的办法，并提出每人每天节省一两米，支援灾区群众，帮助他们渡过目前的困难。
