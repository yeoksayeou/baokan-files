Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 14th: US export trade continued to decline significantly in the first half of this year.

According to figures released by the US Department of Commerce, the total US commodity exports in the first six months of this year amounted to $6.12 billion, compared to $7.25 billion in the first half of 1952. This downward trend in commodity exports reflects both the shrinking of the capitalist world market and the continued development of the gradual decline in US commodity exports since 1952. Commodity exports decreased by 7 percent in 1952 compared to 1951, and decreased by another 15 percent in the first half of this year compared to the first half of last year. Despite the US government's continued large-scale subsidization of exports, and its efforts to maintain the monopolistic and dumping position of US monopoly capital in the international market, it has still failed to reverse this decline.

Simultaneous with the decrease in commodity exports, a significant change has taken place in the structure of US foreign trade. Exports of agricultural products, textiles, and other civilian industrial goods have decreased significantly, while exports of military supplies have increased dramatically. According to figures from the Department of Commerce, US military supply exports reached as high as $1.96 billion in the first half of this year, an increase of one and a half times compared to the first half of last year. The proportion of military supplies in total exports has increased to 24 percent. In the whole year of 1952, military supply exports accounted for 17 percent of total exports.

    美国出口贸易继续衰退
    【新华社十四日讯】华盛顿消息：今年上半年，美国出口贸易继续大大衰退。
    根据美国商务部公布的数字，在今年头六个月，美国的商品输出一共为六十一亿二千多万美元，而一九五二年上半年则为七十二亿五千多万美元。这种商品出口减少的趋势，一方面反映资本主义世界市场的萎缩，同时又说明一九五二年以来美国商品出口逐步减少的情况正在继续发展中。一九五二年商品出口比一九五一年减少百分之七，而今年上半年又比去年上半年减少百分之十五。尽管美国政府一直大量津贴出口，竭力维持美国垄断资本在国际市场中的独占与倾销的地位，仍然没有挽回这一颓势。
    与商品出口减少同时，美国对外贸易的结构发生了显著的变化。农产品，纺织品及其他民用工业物品的出口大大减少了，军事物资的出口却急剧增加。根据商务部的数字，在今年上半年，美国军事物资的出口高达十九亿六千多万美元，比去年上半年增加了一倍半。军事物资在全部出口中的比重已增至百分之二十四。在一九五二年全年，军事物资的出口占全部出口百分之十七。
