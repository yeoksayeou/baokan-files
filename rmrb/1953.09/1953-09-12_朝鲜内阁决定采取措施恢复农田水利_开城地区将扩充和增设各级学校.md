Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 11th: According to the Korean Central News Agency, the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea passed a resolution on the 3rd regarding the implementation of countermeasures to restore and protect farmland.

The report stated: During the Fatherland Liberation War, the American aggressors carried out frantic bombing and burning of farmland, river dikes, irrigation facilities, and local people in various parts of Korea. As a result, vast tracts of farmland in areas adjacent to the front lines and coastlines have become barren; farmland in other areas has also been abandoned. At the same time, the existence of unnecessary roads and facilities built during the war and the presence of bomb craters have reduced the area of cultivated land. Because of the destruction of mountains and rivers, unprecedented floods have occurred repeatedly, inundating much of the farmland in river basins.

In response to this situation, the Cabinet stipulated in its decision: People's Committees at the provincial and municipal levels, with the assistance of various political parties and social organizations, should discuss and establish countermeasures to restore and protect farmland before September 15th, and should organize and mobilize all the people in their jurisdictions in a planned way to launch a nationwide campaign to organize the restoration of farmland affected by floods, abolish unnecessary detours, facilities and trenches located in farmland areas, fill bomb craters, repair and dredge irrigation canals, repair the banks of small rivers and lakes, and embankment projects, protect farmland, and establish flood control forests. All these tasks should be basically completed before next spring's plowing. In order to prevent damage to farmland, it is strictly forbidden to cut down trees in river basins and around farmland, and afforestation and sand control work should be carried out first.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 11th: According to the Korean Central News Agency, the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea passed a decision on the 8th to ensure the expansion and addition of schools at all levels in the Kaesong area.

According to this decision, the number of people's schools (primary schools) in the Kaesong area will be expanded from 19 to 40; the number of junior middle schools will be expanded from 3 to 6; and a new normal college and Songdo (Kaesong's ancient name) University of Political Economy will be established.

    朝鲜内阁决定采取措施恢复农田水利
    开城地区将扩充和增设各级学校
   【新华社平壤十一日电】据朝鲜中央通讯社报道：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁三日通过了关于实施恢复和保护农田对策的决定。
    报道说：在祖国解放战争过程中，美国侵略者对朝鲜各地农田、河川堤防、灌溉设施和当地人民进行了疯狂的轰炸和焚烧。因此，在邻近前线和海岸线等地带，广大农田都变成了荒地；其他各地的农田也有荒废。同时，由于弹坑和战时修建而在今天不必要的道路与设施的存在，耕地面积缩小了；由于山林、河川的被破坏，结果屡次发生从来没有过的水灾，使河川流域的许多耕地被淹。
    针对这种情况，内阁在决定中规定：各道、市人民委员会，要在各政党、社会团体的协助下，在九月十五日以前讨论并建立恢复和保护农田的对策，并要有计划地组织动员辖区全体人民展开全民性的运动，组织进行关于受洪水灾害的农田的恢复工作，废除设在农田地带的不必要的迂回道路、设施和战壕，整理弹坑，修筑和疏通灌溉水渠，补修小河川的河岸、湖岸和沿堤工事，保护农田，设立防水林。所有这些工作到明年春耕前要基本完成。为了预防农田的被害，并要严格禁止采伐河川流域和农田周围的林木，并要首先进行植树造林的工作和防沙的工作。
   【新华社平壤十一日电】据朝鲜中央通讯社报道：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁于八日通过一项关于保证在开城地区扩充和增设各级学校的决定。
    根据这一决定，开城地区的人民学校（小学）将由十九所扩充到四十所；初级中学校将由三所扩充到六所；并将新创设师范专科学校一所和松都
  （开城的古名）政治经济大学。
