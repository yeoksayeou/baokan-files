    Report on the Work of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea
    Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
    Chairman, Members, Comrades:
    The heroic Korean people's war against aggression to defend independence and freedom has lasted for three years and thirty-two days. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army went abroad to fight alongside the Korean People's Army on October 25, 1950, which has been two years and nine months. Now, the Korean Armistice Agreement has been signed, the Korean War has ended, and the struggle of the Chinese and Korean people to defend peace and resist aggression has achieved a great victory. On behalf of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, I would like to present this report to you.
      (I)
      On June 25, 1950, the reactionary ruling clique of the United States instigated the South Korean Syngman Rhee government to launch an attack on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The American aggressors themselves also directly participated in this attack. The heroic Korean people's war against US aggression began from then on. At the same time as launching the war of aggression against Korea, the American aggressors occupied our Taiwan. The arrogant aim of the American aggressors was to conquer the entire Korean peninsula and further invade the People's Republic of China as part of their ambitious plan to dominate the world.
    In order to realize this plan, the American aggressors were not content with the initial defeats they suffered at the hands of the Korean People's Army in the first month or so after starting the war. They gathered their own and their satellite countries' superior forces, which could be put into the Korean battlefield, and landed on the west coast of Korea at Incheon, cutting off the rear traffic of the Korean People's Army, causing serious losses to the Korean people who had gained independence, democracy, and freedom. The aggressors were insatiable and frantically advanced north in a massive offensive.
    After the start of the Korean War, the Chinese people and the Chinese government repeatedly advocated a peaceful solution to the Korean issue, and repeatedly issued warnings demanding that the US armed forces withdraw from Taiwan, quickly stop the war of aggression against Korea, and peacefully resolve the Korean issue and the Far East issue. However, the American aggressors blatantly ignored the warnings of the Chinese people and regarded the Chinese people's advocacy of peace as a sign of weakness. In the early winter of 1950, the American invading army crossed the 38th parallel in a large-scale offensive and attacked the Yalu and Tumen Rivers on our northeastern border, seriously threatening our country's security.
    The Chinese people, having reached the limit of their tolerance, formed the Volunteer Army to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, and went to Korea to resist the aggression of American imperialism together with the Korean People's Army. On November 4, 1950, all democratic parties in our country issued a joint declaration supporting this just action, and pointed out: "If peace-loving people in the world want to obtain peace, they must use active actions to resist atrocities and stop aggression. Only resistance can make the imperialists learn a lesson, and only then can the issue of independence and liberation of Korea and other regions be justly resolved according to the will of the people."
    For more than two years, the great war of the Korean and Chinese people against American aggression has continuously achieved brilliant victories. From October 25, 1950, to the end of May 1951, the heroic Korean and Chinese People's forces conducted five offensive campaigns, driving the American invading forces from the banks of the Yalu and Tumen Rivers back to the south of the 38th parallel, and annihilating more than 190,000 enemy troops, including more than 80,000 American troops. Since then, the Korean and Chinese forces have switched to active defensive positional warfare, building deep defensive positions like copper walls and iron walls on the 250-kilometer front line across Korea. Not only did they stabilize the front line near the 38th parallel, but they also conducted many victorious counterattacks, causing even more serious losses to the enemy. The American invading forces violated humanitarian principles and international conventions, and began a genocidal bacteriological warfare in December 1951, but this was also completely crushed by us. With the support of the great people of the motherland and the Korean people, our army became stronger and stronger, and laid the foundation for victory in the arduous struggle.
    The just action of the Korean and Chinese people in carrying out the war against aggression aims to create conditions for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue on a fair and reasonable basis. Therefore, the people and governments of both Korea and China quickly responded to the peace proposal made by the Soviet government on June 23, 1951, regarding negotiations on a ceasefire and armistice, reiterated their position on resolving the Korean issue peacefully, and began holding Korean armistice negotiations with the United Nations Command on July 10, 1951.
    During the Korean armistice negotiations, although the US government had to accept the armistice negotiations due to military failures and domestic and international pressure, it still unreasonably adopted a policy of delay and sabotage, so that the Korean armistice negotiations went through a tortuous process lasting two years.
    The Korean and Chinese Armistice Negotiation Delegation has always adhered to the attitude of seeking an agreement on a fair and reasonable basis, and with great determination and patience, has successively defeated the US side's conspiracies to use "military pressure," refuse consultation, carry out provocations, and other conspiracies to obstruct the realization of the armistice. By May 1952, both sides had reached an agreement on issues such as the establishment of a military demarcation line, specific arrangements for ceasefire and armistice, and suggestions to the relevant governments of both sides. The only remaining issue was the issue of prisoners of war. Since the US side was always unwilling to abide by the provisions of the Geneva Convention and insisted on its unreasonable claim to forcibly detain prisoners of war, the negotiation on the prisoner of war issue was delayed and difficult to resolve. The US side unilaterally announced a recess on October 8, 1952, interrupting the armistice negotiations.
    On March 30th and 31st of this year, Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of the Central People's Government of our country and Premier Kim Il-sung of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, on behalf of the Chinese and Korean sides, successively put forward new proposals for resolving the prisoner of war issue in two steps, advocating that after the armistice, both sides should immediately repatriate all prisoners of war they hold who insist on repatriation, and transfer the remaining prisoners of war to neutral countries to ensure a fair resolution of their repatriation issues. This new proposal by the Chinese and Korean sides has won universal sympathy and support from world public opinion, leading to the resumption of armistice negotiations, and finally reaching an agreement on the prisoner of war issue on June 8, 1953.
    After the prisoner of war issue was resolved, the US side condoned the Syngman Rhee group in forcibly detaining 27,000 of our prisoners of war, attempting to use this to undermine the realization of the armistice. But this conspiracy did not succeed. Thanks to the policy of the Korean and Chinese people in adhering to a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and thanks to the great efforts made by the people of the world for the cause of peace, an agreement was finally reached after two years of Korean armistice negotiations, and both sides signed the armistice agreement at Panmunjom on July 27, 1953. The Korean armistice, which the whole world universally longed for, has finally been realized.
    The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement is a great victory for the heroic Korean and Chinese people, a great victory for the democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union, and a victory for the peace-loving forces of the world. It is completely understandable that peace-loving people all over the world are rejoicing for this.
      (II)
    The great victory of the struggle of the Korean and Chinese people to defend peace and resist aggression is of great significance and has a huge and far-reaching impact on the situation in the Far East and the world.
    When the American imperialists launched the war of aggression, they were confident that the young Democratic People's Republic of Korea would be vulnerable, and that the Chinese people, who had just been liberated for a year, would not dare to rise up to support their neighbors in jointly opposing American aggression. Therefore, they hoped to use a blitzkrieg to achieve their arrogant goal of occupying the entire Korean peninsula and then invading our Northeast. Syngman Rhee, the running dog of the American imperialists, once clamored about "completing the Northern Expedition in three days." On October 15, 1950, MacArthur, then commander-in-chief of the United Nations Command, met with US President Truman on Wake Island and arrogantly declared that "formal resistance in all parts of North and South Korea will end before Thanksgiving," and said: "The possibility of the Chinese rising up to resist is extremely small." When the American invading forces reached the banks of the Yalu River, the warmongers in the United States even made absurd and outrageous remarks, saying: "Historically, the Yalu River is not an insurmountable obstacle that clearly divides the two countries (China and Korea)." However, the American interventionists miscalculated, and their arrogant ambitions of aggression were shattered. The heroic Korean people withstood the severe test of war, resolutely resisted the United Nations forces headed by the United States, and defended the independence and freedom of their motherland. The heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army carried out a just struggle, defended the security of the motherland, and aided the people of Korea, thereby ensuring the smooth progress of our country's economic recovery and construction work. After three years of fierce fighting, the first-class army of the largest industrial power in the capitalist world was confined to the place where they originally launched the aggression, not only unable to cross the boundary, but also falling into an increasingly unfavorable predicament. This is a lesson of great international significance. It eloquently proves that the era when Western aggressors could occupy a country by simply erecting a few cannons on a coast in the East for hundreds of years is gone forever. Today, any imperialist aggression can be defeated by relying on the strength of the people. It also eloquently proves that a nation that has awakened and dares to rise up to fight for the glory, independence, and security of its motherland is invincible. The wheels of Asian history, which have undergone profound changes after the Second World War, especially after the victory of the Chinese revolution, cannot be reversed by aggressive forces. There is no doubt that the Korean lessons will inspire all colonial and semi-colonial peoples to resist imperialists for the defense of their homeland and inspire them to intensify the struggle for the independence, peace, democracy, and unity of their country. This is a major contribution to ensuring peace in the Far East.
    The victory of the Korean and Chinese people's war against aggression was achieved under the conditions of a disparity in military equipment between the enemy and ourselves. In the past 37 months, the American invading forces used Korea as a testing ground for new weapons of mass destruction, and many new weapons were used on a large scale. In addition to coercing fifteen satellite countries to send troops to participate in the war, the American aggressors mainly mobilized one-third of their own army, one-fifth of their air force, and most of their navy as the main force in the war of aggression against Korea, and put the entire national economy on a military track, investing a large amount of military equipment and materials in the war. However, the Korean and Chinese People's forces, whose military equipment was inferior, were still able to annihilate a large number of enemy troops and consume a large amount of enemy military equipment and materials in the war. From June 25, 1950, to the armistice on July 27, 1953, the Korean and Chinese People's armies killed, wounded, and captured a total of more than 1.09 million enemy troops, including more than 390,000 American troops; shot down and damaged more than 12,200 enemy aircraft; sank and damaged 257 enemy ships of various types; and destroyed and seized countless other combat materials from the enemy. During this period, the enemy transported more than 73 million tons of combat materials to Korea, and the direct war expenditure was more than 20 billion US dollars. At the same time, the Korean and Chinese People's forces not only rapidly improved and upgraded their equipment and technical level, formed and strengthened various new services and arms, but also absorbed the rich experience of modern warfare, thereby increasingly enhancing the combat strength of our army. The enemy's attrition rate of manpower became larger and larger; conversely, our army's attrition rate of manpower became smaller and smaller. The strategic situation and the balance of power became more and more favorable to our army. Thus, even former US Secretary of Defense Marshall was forced to declare when talking about the Korean War: "The myth has been shattered. The United States is not as strong a country as people imagined." Other American generals could not but admit: "The superiority of the navy and air force cannot determine the Korean War"; the Korean War was "the most costly, bloodiest" and "protracted and difficult to resolve war that the United States has fought." The brilliant achievements of the Korean and Chinese People's armies in defeating the invading army with superior equipment with inferior equipment completely exposed the lie of the "omnipotent role" of new weapons that the American imperialists had consistently used to blackmail, threaten, and intimidate since the end of World War II, thereby thoroughly exposing the weakness of the military thought of the imperialist camp and the true inside story of their so-called "powerful war machine", disrupting their plans and deployments to prepare for another world war. The Korean and Chinese People's armies proved to the world that the American imperialists are outwardly strong but inwardly weak, and that their aggression can be completely defeated.
    The truth of the enemy's brutality and weakness has been exposed on the battlefield, and the enemy's warlike and unreasonable imperialist face has also been exposed in the Korean armistice negotiations. This has made them increasingly isolated in the eyes of the people of the world. The Korean armistice negotiations are an unprecedented armistice negotiation. It is neither an armistice negotiation in which imperialists conquered other countries and forced other countries to accept surrender terms, nor an armistice negotiation between imperialist countries fighting each other and unable to make a decision, and had to compromise and divide colonies to seek temporary peace, but an armistice negotiation that an imperialist who attempted to dominate the world was forced to give up and reluctantly accept after being resisted and contained by young and emerging people's democratic countries in a war of aggression. Obviously, imperialists would not willingly accept such negotiations, and they are constantly trying to overturn the verdict. Therefore, the Korean armistice negotiations cannot but be an unusually acute, complex, and long-term struggle interwoven with military and diplomatic efforts. Throughout the entire negotiation process, the US side has consistently displayed a violent attitude of refusing to admit military defeat, unwilling to negotiate on an equal footing, and disregarding the most basic international laws. During the second agenda item of discussing the establishment of a military demarcation line in 1951, the US side demanded to seize more than 12,000 square kilometers of land north of the 38th parallel, and openly spread the argument of "let bombs, cannons, and machine guns debate." At the same time, the US side launched the so-called "summer offensive" and "autumn offensive," vainly attempting to exert military pressure on our side, but as a result suffered serious losses. After the negotiations turned to the third agenda item, the US side put forward many unreasonable demands that interfered in the internal affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, shamelessly publishing in the meeting the fallacy of "Let us forget the fragmented nouns of sovereignty and internal affairs. Complete sovereignty is an abstract concept that no longer exists in any country in the world." When all these delusions and rogue tactics of the US side failed to achieve their goals and the armistice negotiations were close to agreement, they implemented a despicable policy of obstruction and delay on the issue of prisoners of war. In the negotiations, the Korean and Chinese sides, on the one hand, continuously shattered the enemy's "military pressure" to打击其气焰(hit their arrogance), so that what they could not get on the battlefield they could not get at the conference table; on the other hand, they sought to reach an agreement through firm and patient efforts, thus exposing the true face of the war-mongering war dealers of the American reactionaries who wanted war but not peace.
    During the three years of war and two years of negotiations, the American imperialists suffered serious failures not only militarily but also politically and morally, and became increasingly isolated. At the same time, during this period, more and more people in various countries increasingly recognized the truth about the American aggressors and increasingly supported the reasonable proposals of the Korean and Chinese sides to promote the Korean armistice and peacefully resolve international disputes.
    The American imperialists tried their best to use the international tension caused by the Korean War to further control the capitalist world and turn the capitalist countries into their military, political, and economic appendages. However, due to the failure in the Korean War, this plan of the American imperialists to enslave the capitalist world has also been thwarted. The US government coerced fifteen countries including Britain, France, and Canada to participate in the war of aggression against Korea, and used this war to greatly strengthen its political and economic control over these countries. The American imperialists deeply penetrated the colonies and spheres of influence of Britain and France, seizing their raw materials and sales markets. France's position in Vietnam is gradually being squeezed out by the United States. The European Military Treaty was forced on the countries of Western Europe. According to this treaty, the participating countries will be forced to cede their national sovereignty to the so-called supra-national European group organization controlled by the United States. Under the "aid" of the American "Marshall Plan" and "Foreign Aid Act," the US government desperately supported the armed forces of West Germany and Japan, reviving the two sources of World War II, thereby threatening the security of many countries in Western Europe and the Far East. The American ruling clique pointed fingers at the countries participating in the war of aggression against Korea, arrogantly regarding themselves as the dominant nation. The US government also forced its allies to implement an embargo and blockade against the People's Republic of China, depriving them of their economic sovereignty. Under the "aid" of the American "Marshall Plan" and "Foreign Aid Act," these countries implemented the expansion of armaments and the militarization of the national economy, resulting in a great deepening of the economic crisis, a deteriorating people's livelihood, and increasing internal economic and political difficulties. This policy of enslavement and plunder by the American aggressors cannot but arouse the most profound dissatisfaction of their partners, sharpening and expanding the contradictions between them. These countries have always dared to be angry but dared not speak out. Now, on the one hand, because the myth of America's "invincible power" was shattered in the Korean War, and on the other hand, because the so-called "communist threat" consistently clamored by American warmongers has been proven unfounded by facts, some bourgeoisies in these countries have finally seen that following the United States is of no benefit, but is tantamount to suicide, thereby increasing their sentiment of trying to get rid of American control by "adopting a more independent policy." The situation of the third meeting of the Seventh General Assembly of the United Nations recently proved that this sentiment of not wanting to be controlled by the United States has developed to the point of beginning to openly confront the United States.
    From a general perspective, the Korean armistice reflects the true balance of power in the current international situation, which is beneficial to the peace and democracy camp and unfavorable to the imperialist aggressive camp. As early as October 23, 1951, Chairman Mao pointed out in his opening remarks at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "Our enemies are short-sighted. They cannot see the strength of our great domestic and international unity. They cannot see that the era in which the Chinese people were bullied by foreign imperialism has been forever declared over by the establishment of the People's Republic of China. They also cannot see the era of imperialism dominating the world has been forever declared over by the establishment of the socialist Soviet Union, by the establishment of the People's Republic of China, by the establishment of various people's democratic countries, by the consolidated solidarity of the two great countries of China and the Soviet Union on the basis of the Treaty on Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, by the consolidated solidarity of the entire peace and democracy camp, and by the deep sympathy of the vast peace-loving people of the world for this great camp. Our enemies cannot see these things. They still want to bully the People's Republic of China. They still want to dominate the world. But, comrades, I can assert that their ideas are arrogant, futile, and impossible to achieve. On the contrary, the People's Republic of China cannot be bullied, the great peace camp headed by the Soviet Union cannot be violated, and the peace-loving people of the world cannot be deceived." The entire course of the Korean War confirmed this correct analysis by Chairman Mao. The attainment of the Korean armistice is the result of the failure of imperialist military adventures, and the result of the great victory won by the Korean and Chinese people with the sympathy and support of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union and the peace-loving people of the world. It illustrates as vividly as possible the increasingly deepening political and economic difficulties and disintegration caused by the imperialist camp implementing a policy of war, and also illustrates the increasing political and economic strength and rock-solid unity gained by the entire peace and democracy camp due to its adherence to a policy of peaceful construction.
    The victory of the just struggle of the Korean and Chinese people proves that in the current international situation, only peaceful consultation between the countries concerned is the only possible and correct way to resolve international disputes. More than three years ago, the reactionary ruling clique of the United States tore up the decision of the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain, refused to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, and embarked on the path of military adventure. Now, the cruel reality on the Korean battlefield has proven that this path is no longer feasible, forcing them to accept the armistice and return to the path of peaceful consultation to resolve the Korean issue. This is a very significant lesson and warning for adventurers who are obsessed with using a "policy of strength" to resolve international disputes, and it is a great encouragement for the movement of people in various countries to strive for a peaceful resolution of international disputes. All peace-loving people will admit that since the Korean War, which lasted for more than three years and was extremely fierce, can be terminated by negotiation, then any unresolved international issues or disputes now, including the post-armistice Korean issue, can of course be peacefully resolved on the basis of mutual agreement between the countries concerned. Due to the success of the Korean armistice, the current international situation is more conducive to the struggle of the people of the world for peace; at the same time, due to the frustration of the imperialist war plan, the aggressive bloc headed by the United States is struggling desperately. Therefore, the Korean and Chinese people and all peace-loving people in the world now need to make further efforts to strive for the easing of international tensions and for world peace more than ever before; at the same time, they also need to be seriously vigilant against the conspiracies of the imperialists to try to obstruct the advance of the wheels of peace. There is no doubt that in the current situation of the balance of power, as pointed out by Comrade Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, "as long as the people of all countries are vigilant and work hard to prevent the implementation of the aggressors' plans, then peace will surely be guaranteed."
      (III)
    The source of strength of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the fundamental reason for its victory is the righteousness of the great struggle to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea.
    The Chinese People's Volunteer Army is a truly people-based army with a high degree of political consciousness and noble qualities. It inherited the glorious tradition of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. It was cultivated under the spirit of patriotism, and it was cultivated under the spirit of internationalism of respecting and caring for other nations. It was also formed and strengthened in the struggle to defend peace in the Far East and the world.
    All officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army generally and profoundly realized that the war they were waging was a just war against aggression, representing the will and wishes of the people of the motherland and the peace-loving people of the world; what they were carrying out was the great and glorious task of defending the security of the motherland, defending the independence and freedom of the Korean people, and defending peace in the Far East and the world. Therefore, their morale was very high and their fighting will was very high. Every soldier showed unparalleled courage, strength, initiative, and agility on the battlefield, and showed earth-shattering revolutionary heroism and self-sacrifice. In the past three years, more than 300,000 meritorious people have emerged in the Volunteer Army, including many glorious heroes and models like Yang Gensi, Huang Jiguang, Guo Zhongtian, Huang Jiafu, Sun Zhanyuan, and Qiu Shaoyun. Their outstanding heroic deeds, their courage, perseverance, tenacity, and fearlessness, have promoted the power of justice to the people of the world, and will be remembered forever in the annals of the people of the world's struggle to defend peace.
    Because justice and truth are on our side, and because we have a deeply rooted belief in the cause of peace, our negotiators have always been able to fight righteously and win victories in the process of the Korean armistice negotiations. They tirelessly exposed and打击 (hit) the enemy's various conspiracies to delay, obstruct, and sabotage the negotiations, and put forward our honest and reasonable proposals, making everything clear and distinguishing right from wrong. They carried out a serious struggle with determination and patience, and finally made this unprecedented long-term, complex, and acute Korean armistice negotiation a success, opening the way for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.
    For the past three years, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army have fought side by side, supporting each other like brothers. We fought and lived with the Korean people, and we deeply know that the Chinese and Korean people are as close as lips and teeth, sharing weal and woe. We further recognized that the aggressive and warlike elements of the United States are the common deadly enemies of the people of China and Korea, and we deeply realized that in order to defend our homes and defend our country, we must resist US aggression and aid Korea. In the three years of common struggle, the combat friendship between our army and the Korean people and the Korean People's Army, which was forged with blood, has been further consolidated, and the feelings of internationalism have been further deepened. In the intervals between battles, our army often helped the Korean people with spring plowing and autumn harvesting, repairing canals and controlling water, planting trees and building houses, and preventing epidemics and relieving disasters. In the past year, our army also saved more than 10 million catties of grain from its own supplies to help the Korean disaster victims. We are in Korea as if we were in our motherland. The example of Martyr Luo Shengjiao is a symbol of the internationalist consciousness of our entire army. The heroic Korean people under the leadership of Marshal Kim Il-sung also loved and supported our army with unparalleled enthusiasm. The Workers' Party of Korea and the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea were constantly concerned about us and constantly helping us. The Korean people automatically let us live in their houses, lent us furniture, helped us transport grain and water, and transported the wounded. Deeply touching deeds like those of Martyr Park Jae-geun, who risked his life to rescue the wounded of our army, were everywhere. All this made us deeply feel that the Korean people are just like our own brothers and sisters, getting along seamlessly and as close as blood relatives. We will never forget the care and support of the Korean people for our army. The brave, industrious, and arduous fighting spirit of the Korean people not only encouraged the courage of our army to fight, but also profoundly educated all commanders and fighters of our army, further improving their internationalist thought. We are deeply proud and honored to have such a brave and industrious neighboring country.
    The struggle to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea is a serious test for the people of our country. Now, after three years of struggle, people can see that the people of our country have not only successfully withstood this test, but have also become stronger. The people of our country have never been so highly united spiritually and politically as they are today, the relationship between our various ethnic groups has never been so friendly and united as it is today, and the patriotic spirit of the people of our country has never been so vigorous and high-spirited as it is today.
    The full support of the people of our country played a very important role in enabling us to win such a great victory on the Korean front. For the past three years, under the slogan of resisting US aggression and defending our homes, the people of our great motherland have been carrying out the great recovery and construction work of the economy on the one hand, and carrying out the great movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea to support the Volunteer Army on the other hand, so that we can obtain an endless stream of material supplies and an overwhelming spiritual encouragement, enabling us to smoothly打击 (hit) the aggressors until today's victory. On behalf of the entire army, I would like to express my sincere gratitude and respect to the people of our motherland who fully support us. We can confidently say that the enthusiastic and huge support of the people of our country will be recorded in history alongside the heroic struggle of our army, and has established brilliant achievements in the cause of defending peace in the Far East and the world.
    The people of all ethnic groups and all walks of life in the country signed up for the Volunteer Army with unprecedented enthusiasm, and moving deeds of mothers sending their sons, wives sending their husbands, and brothers vying to join the army appeared everywhere, and new combat forces continued to join the ranks of the Volunteer Army. Thousands upon thousands of railway workers, truck drivers, and civilian workers went to the Korean front to undertake various transportation and logistics tasks, ensuring the victorious completion of combat missions. Medical workers organized a large number of medical teams to serve the Chinese and Korean forces. A nationwide movement to慰问 (comfort) the Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, a movement to donate weapons, and a patriotic health campaign to completely smash the bacteriological warfare of US imperialism were launched, and all these tasks were successfully completed.
    The working class enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call to "increase production, practice thrift, and support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army", put forward the fighting slogan of "the factory is the battlefield, the machine is the gun", launched patriotic labor competitions, gave full play to a high degree of production initiative and creativity, ensured the recovery and development of the national economy, and supplied the huge and heavy needs of the front line in a timely and sufficient manner.
    The peasants supported our army's operations by launching patriotic production increase movements, which enabled national agricultural production to be rapidly restored and exceed the highest historical level, providing a strong guarantee for the supply of grain to the Korean front.
    The intellectuals of our country did not lag behind the working class and the peasants in the patriotic cause of supporting the front. They promoted our country's science and culture and education in the movement to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, serving national construction and serving national defense.
    The patriotic people of other classes in our country also made great contributions to supporting the movement to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea.
    The people of the whole country carried out large-scale work to provide preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs and the families of revolutionary servicemen, and regarded preferential treatment work as a major task in supporting the front. Under the slogan of "first the families of servicemen, then ourselves", the people in cities and rural areas all made great efforts and took many measures to ensure the life and production of the families of martyrs and the families of servicemen, which not only encouraged the production enthusiasm of the families of martyrs and the families of servicemen, but also directly encouraged the morale of the soldiers on the front.
    The movement to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea educated the people of the whole country in patriotism and internationalism, greatly enhancing national self-esteem and self-confidence, and strengthening the determination to unite against the enemy and repel US aggression. It was on this ideological basis that a strong material force was generated to support the Volunteer Army and the Korean people in resisting aggression, defending peace in the Far East, and defending world peace through various aspects. At the same time, the major and profound changes in the face of the motherland caused by the movement to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, and the unprecedented upsurge in the people's political consciousness and organization, in turn became the most important force to encourage the entire army to have a hundredfold courage and become stronger and stronger.
    The strong unity and hard work of the Communist Party of China and the organizations at all levels of the democratic parties, various people's organizations, and patriotic people from all walks of life enabled the patriotic movement to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea to be rapidly launched and achieve success. All the efforts of the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and our great and wise leader Chairman Mao Zedong, were united into a huge torrent, breaking through all difficulties and leading the struggle to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea to a great victory.
    The victory of the struggle to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea is inseparable from the support and assistance of our great ally, the Soviet Union, inseparable from the support and assistance of various people's democratic countries, and inseparable from the support and assistance of the peace-loving people of the world. For the past three years, these supports and assistance have been encouraging our army to advance heroically. Here, on behalf of the entire army, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks and infinite respect to the fraternal countries of the democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union and the peace-loving people of the world. We must further strengthen the friendship and unity with our great ally, the Soviet Union, and various people's democratic countries, and raise the banner of internationalism, which has won every battle!
      (IV)
    Comrades! The Korean armistice has now been realized. The Korean people, who have won the victory in the war against aggression, under the leadership of Marshal Kim Il-sung, and under the leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea and the government, are enthusiastically responding to the call of "everything for strengthening the democratic base and restoring and developing the post-war people's economy", working hard to heal the wounds of war, rebuild a peaceful life, strengthen the armed forces, and strive for the peaceful reunification of the motherland. The Chinese people wholeheartedly congratulate the Korean people on being able to successfully complete these great and complex arduous tasks at an early date. The Chinese people are prepared to do everything possible to help the Korean people. All officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army regard the difficulties faced by the Korean people as their own difficulties, and will do their best to help the Korean people overcome difficulties, and regard this as the most glorious task. I am deeply convinced that the Korean people, who have the strong leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea and Marshal Kim Il-sung and the support of the countries of the democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union, who have had five years of peaceful construction experience after liberation, and who have proven their infinite loyalty to the motherland in the three years of war and have shown the heroic spirit of daring to overcome difficulties, will surely further exert great strength and achieve new brilliant and great achievements in the arduous task of strengthening the armed forces and rebuilding a peaceful life in the future. I wish the Democratic People's Republic of Korea an infinitely bright future!
    However, the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement is only the beginning of a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The current task is to consolidate the Korean armistice, ensure strict compliance with the armistice terms to prevent the recurrence of aggressive war, and promote the smooth convening of political conferences to further seek a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.
    The Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, together, have been and will continue to strictly abide by and fulfill all the provisions of the armistice agreement. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army resolutely supports the statements issued by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of our country and Foreign Minister Nam Il of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on August 24 and 25, respectively, regarding the issue of political conferences, and the principles on the membership of the political conferences proposed by Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet government's delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, on August 25 to the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly. The attitude of the three countries, China, Korea, and the Soviet Union, towards the political conferences not only fully complies with the principles of Article 4, Paragraph 60 of the Korean Armistice Agreement, but only in this way can the political conferences be convened on a sound and reasonable basis, and proceed in a harmonious atmosphere after the

    关于中国人民志愿军抗美援朝工作的报告
    中国人民志愿军司令员　彭德怀主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    英雄的朝鲜人民为捍卫独立自由而展开的反侵略战争，一共进行了三年零三十二天。一九五零年十月二十五日，中国人民志愿军出国与朝鲜人民军并肩作战，亦已达两年零九个月。现在，朝鲜停战协定已经签字，朝鲜战争已经停止，中朝人民保卫和平反抗侵略的斗争已经取得了伟大胜利。我代表中国人民志愿军谨向各位提出报告。
      （一）
      一九五零年六月二十五日，美国反动统治集团唆使南朝鲜李承晚政府发动了对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的进攻，美国侵略者自己跟着也直接参加了这个进攻。英勇的朝鲜人民抗美战争从此开始。美国侵略者在发动侵朝战争的同时，侵占了我国台湾。美国侵略者的狂妄目的是要征服全部朝鲜，并进一步侵犯中华人民共和国，作为他们称霸世界的野心计划的一部分。
    为了实现这个计划，美国侵略者不甘心于他们在挑起战争后最初一个多月内在朝鲜人民军手上所遭受的失败，竟纠集了他们自己的和仆从国家的可以投入朝鲜战线的优势兵力，在朝鲜西海岸仁川登陆，截断朝鲜人民军的后方交通，使获得独立、民主、自由的朝鲜人民遭受严重的损失；侵略者并贪得无厌，疯狂地大举向北进犯。
    朝鲜战争开始后，中国人民和中国政府就一再主张和平解决朝鲜问题，并一再提出警告，要求美国武装力量退出台湾，迅速停止侵朝战争，和平解决朝鲜问题和远东问题。但是，美国侵略者悍然无视中国人民的警告，并把中国人民的和平主张认为是软弱的表示。一九五零年冬初，美国侵略军大举越过三八线，向我国东北边境的鸭绿江和图们江进攻，严重地威胁了我国的安全。
    中国人民在忍无可忍之际，这才组成了抗美援朝保家卫国的志愿军，开往朝鲜，和朝鲜人民军一道，抵抗美国帝国主义者的侵略。我国各民主党派于一九五零年十一月四日发表了联合宣言，支持这一正义的行动，并指出：“世界上爱好和平的人民如果想要得到和平，就必须用积极行动来抵抗暴行，制止侵略。只有抵抗，才有可能使帝国主义者获得教训，才有可能按照人民的意志公正地解决朝鲜及其他地区的独立和解放的问题。”
    两年多以来，朝中人民伟大的反抗美国侵略的战争，不断取得了光辉的胜利。英勇的朝中人民部队在一九五零年十月二十五日到一九五一年五月下旬期间，进行了五次攻势作战，把美国侵略军从鸭绿江边和图们江边赶回到三八线以南，歼灭了敌军十九万余人，其中包括美军八万多人。自此以后，朝中部队即转而采取了积极防御的阵地战，在横贯朝鲜的二百五十公里战线上构筑了铜墙铁壁般的纵深的防御阵地，不仅把战线在三八线附近稳定下来，而且进行了多次胜利的反击，使敌军遭受了更为严重的损失。美国侵略军违背人道，破坏国际公约，竟于一九五一年十二月开始进行灭绝人性的细菌战；但也被我们所彻底粉碎。我军得到伟大祖国人民和朝鲜人民的支援，愈战愈强，在艰苦的斗争中奠定了胜利的局面。
    朝中人民进行反侵略战争的正义行动，其目的是为了争取条件，使朝鲜问题得以在公平合理的基础上获致和平解决。所以，朝中两国人民和政府迅速响应了一九五一年六月二十三日苏联政府所提出的关于谈判停火与休战的和平建议，重申以和平方式解决朝鲜问题的主张，并于一九五一年七月十日与联合国军方面开始举行朝鲜停战谈判。
    在朝鲜停战谈判过程中，美国政府虽然由于军事失败和国内国际压力而不得不接受停战谈判，但仍横蛮无理地采取了拖延与破坏的政策，以致朝鲜停战谈判经历了两年之久的迂回曲折的过程。
    朝中停战谈判代表团始终坚持在公平合理基础上谋求达成协议的态度，并以极大的坚定和耐心，逐次击破了美方使用“军事压力”、拒绝协商、进行挑衅以及其他种种阻挠停战实现的阴谋。到一九五二年五月，双方已对建立军事分界线、停火与停战的具体安排和向双方有关各国政府建议事项等问题取得了协议，剩下的只是战俘问题。由于美方始终不愿遵守日内瓦公约的规定，坚持其强迫扣留战俘的无理主张，战俘问题的谈判遂拖延难决。美方并在一九五二年十月八日片面宣告休会，中断了停战谈判。
    今年三月三十日和三十一日，我中央人民政府周恩来总理兼外长和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府金日成首相代表中朝方面先后提出了分两步解决战俘问题的新建议，主张在停战以后双方立即遣返其所收容的一切坚持遣返的战俘，而将其余战俘转交中立国，以保证对他们的遣返问题的公正解决。中朝方面的这一新建议获得了全世界舆论的普遍同情与支持，导致了停战谈判的恢复，并使战俘问题终于在一九五三年六月八日达成了协议。
    美方在战俘问题解决之后，又纵容李承晚集团强迫扣留了我方战俘二万七千人，企图借此破坏停战的实现。但是这个阴谋并未得逞。由于朝中人民坚持和平解决朝鲜问题的政策，由于世界人民为了和平事业而作的巨大努力，经历两年的朝鲜停战谈判终于达成了协议，双方于一九五三年七月二十七日在板门店签订了停战协定。全世界普遍渴望的朝鲜停战，终于实现了。
    朝鲜停战协定的签订，是英勇的朝中人民的伟大胜利，是以苏联为首的民主阵营的伟大胜利，是世界爱好和平力量的胜利。全世界爱好和平的人民都为之欢欣鼓舞，这是完全可以理解的。
      （二）
    朝中人民保卫和平，反抗侵略的斗争的伟大胜利，具有十分重大的意义，对远东及世界局势有巨大而深远的影响。
    美国帝国主义者当发动侵略战争之初，满以为年青的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国是不堪一击的，满以为解放刚才一年的中国人民是不敢起而支援其邻人共同反对美国侵略的，因而他们指望用闪电式的袭击来达到侵占全部朝鲜并进而侵犯我国东北的狂妄目的。美国帝国主义者的走狗李承晚曾经叫嚣什么“三天完成北伐”。一九五零年十月十五日，当时的联合国军总司令麦克阿瑟在威克岛与美国总统杜鲁门会晤，竟狂妄地宣称“在感恩节前，南北朝鲜各地的正式抵抗都将告终”，并且说：“中国人起而抵抗的可能性极为微小”。当美国侵略军进达鸭绿江边时，美国的好战分子们更发出荒谬绝伦的狂言，他们说：“在历史上，鸭绿江并不是把（中朝）两国截然划分的不可逾越的障碍。”然而，美国干涉者失算了，他们的狂妄侵略野心被粉碎了。英雄的朝鲜人民经受了严重的战争考验，坚决地抗击了以美国为首的联合国军，保卫了自己祖国的独立自由。英勇的中国人民志愿军进行了正义的斗争，捍卫了祖国的安全，援助了朝鲜的人民，从而保障了我国经济恢复和建设工作的顺利进行。在三年激战之后，资本主义世界最大工业强国的第一流军队被限制在他们原来发动侵略的地方，不仅不能越雷池一步，而且陷入日益不利的困境。这是一个具有重大国际意义的教训。它雄辩地证明：西方侵略者几百年来只要在东方一个海岸上架起几尊大炮就可霸占一个国家的时代是一去不复返了，今天的任何帝国主义的侵略都是可以依靠人民的力量击败的。它也雄辩地证明：一个觉醒了的、敢于为祖国光荣、独立和安全而奋起战斗的民族是不可战胜的。在第二次世界大战后、特别是中国革命胜利后起了深刻变化的亚洲历史的前进车轮，是侵略势力所绝对不能扭转的。毫无疑问，朝鲜的教训将鼓舞一切殖民地半殖民地人民为保卫祖国而抵抗帝国主义者的决心和信心，鼓舞他们加紧地展开争取本国的独立、和平、民主、统一的斗争。这对于保障远东和平，是一个重大的贡献。
    朝中人民反侵略战争的胜利，是在敌我双方军事装备悬殊的条件下取得的。在过去三十七个月的长久时期内，美国侵略军把朝鲜当作进行大规模屠杀的新武器的试验场，许多新武器都大规模地使用过了。美国侵略者除胁迫十五个仆从国家派遣兵力参加作战之外，主要地动员了它自己的陆军的三分之一、空军的五分之一和海军的大部作为侵朝战争的主力，并把整个国民经济转上军事轨道，以大量的军事装备和物资投入战争。但是，军事装备居于劣势的朝中人民部队却仍然能够在战争中大量歼灭敌人的有生力量，大量消耗敌人的军事装备和物资。从一九五零年六月二十五日到一九五三年七月二十七日停战时止，朝中人民军队毙、伤、俘敌军共一百零九万多人，其中美军三十九万多人；击落击伤敌机一万二千二百多架；击沉击伤敌军各种舰艇二百五十七艘；击毁和缴获敌军其他各种作战物资无数。敌人在这一期间运往朝鲜的作战物资在七千三百万吨以上，直接战费的消耗在二百亿美元以上。同时，朝中人民部队不仅迅速改善和提高了自己的装备和技术水平，组成和壮大了各项新的兵种，而且吸取了现代化战争的丰富经验，从而日益增强了我军的战斗力量。敌人有生力量的消耗率愈来愈大；相反地，我军有生力量的消耗率则愈来愈小。战略形势与力量对比愈益对我军有利。这样，连美国前国防部长马歇尔在谈到朝鲜战争时，也被迫宣告：“神话已经破灭了。美国原来并不是像人家所想像的那样一个强国。”美国的旁的将军们也不能不承认：“海空军的优势决定不了朝鲜的战争”；朝鲜战争是“美国所进行的一次代价最大、流血最多”而又“旷日持久、难于解决的战争”。朝中人民军队以劣势装备对抗优势装备的侵略军而取得胜利的辉煌战绩，把自第二次世界大战结束以来美国帝国主义者一贯用以讹诈、威胁和吓人的新武器的
  “万能作用”论的谎言完全揭穿了，从而彻底地暴露了帝国主义阵营的军事思想的软弱无力，和他们的所谓“强大战争机器”的虚弱的真正内幕，打乱了他们准备另一次世界大战的计划和部署。朝中人民军队向全世界证明：美国帝国主义者是外强中干的，他们的侵略是完全可以打败的。
    敌人的残暴和虚弱的真相在战场上暴露出来了，而敌人的好战和横蛮无理的帝国主义面目，也在朝鲜停战谈判中暴露出来了。这就使他们在全世界人民面前日益孤立。朝鲜停战谈判是一次史无前例的停战谈判。它既不是帝国主义者征服了别的国家、强迫别国接受投降条件的停战谈判，也不是帝国主义国家间争夺火并、相持不决，只好以妥协瓜分殖民地谋得短暂和平的停战谈判，而是一个妄图独霸世界的帝国主义者，在侵略战争中遭受到年青的新兴的人民民主国家的反抗并遏制之后，不得不罢手而勉强接受的停战谈判。很显然，帝国主义者对于这样的谈判是不会甘心情愿地接受的，他无时无刻不在力图翻案。因此，朝鲜停战谈判不能不是一场异常尖锐的、复杂而长期的军事与外交交织着的斗争。美方在整个谈判过程中始终表现出不肯承认军事失败、不愿平等协商、不顾最起码的国际法则的狂暴态度。在一九五一年讨论建立军事分界线的第二项议程时，美方要求夺取三八线以北的一万二千多平方公里的土地，并公然散布“让炸弹、大炮和机关枪去辩论吧”的论调。美方同时发动所谓“夏季攻势”和“秋季攻势”，妄图对我方施行军事压力，但结果是遭受了严重的损失。谈判转入第三项议程后，美方又提出许多干涉朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内政的无理要求，恬不知耻地在会议上发表“让我们忘记主权、内政这些支离破碎的名辞吧。完整主权是一个抽象概念，它已不存在于现在世界上的任何国家”的谬论。当美方所有这些妄想和无赖手段都不能达到目的而停战谈判已经接近协议时，他们就在战俘问题上实行卑劣的阻挠拖延政策。朝中方面在谈判中，一方面不断地粉碎敌人的“军事压力”以打击其气焰，使得他们在战场上得不到的东西在会议桌上也得不到；另一方面又以坚定耐心的努力，谋求谈判达成协议，这样就暴露了美国反动集团要战争不要和平的战争贩子的真面目。
    在三年战争、两年谈判期间，美国帝国主义者不仅在军事上，而且在政治上和道义上都遭受到了严重的失败，而日益孤立。同时，在这个期间，各国有愈来愈多的人日益认清美国侵略者的真相，日益支持朝中方面促致朝鲜停战、和平解决国际纠纷的合理主张。
    美国帝国主义者竭力想利用朝鲜战争所产生的国际紧张局势，来进一步控制资本主义世界，把各资本主义国家变成他们的军事上、政治上和经济上的附庸。但是，由于在朝鲜战争中的失败，美国帝国主义者这一奴役资本主义世界各国的计划也受到了挫折。美国政府胁迫英国、法国、加拿大等十五个国家参加了侵朝战争，并利用这个战争大大地加强了对于这些国家的政治和经济的控制。美国帝国主义者深深地打进了英法的殖民地和势力范围，夺取了他们的原料和销售市场。法国在越南的地位正在逐步为美国所排挤。欧洲军条约被强加在西欧各国的头上，按照这个条约，各参加国将被迫把自己的国家主权出让给美国所控制的所谓超国家的欧洲集团组织。藉口朝鲜战争所产生的局势，美国政府拚命扶持西德和日本的武装力量，复活这两个世界大战的策源地，从而威胁了西欧和远东许多国家的安全。美国统治集团对参加侵朝战争各国颐指气使，骄横不堪地以主宰民族自居。美国政府也强迫其盟国对中华人民共和国实行禁运和封锁，剥夺了他们的经济主权。这些国家在美国“马歇尔计划”和“援外法案”的“援助”之下，实行扩张军备和国民经济军事化的结果，经济危机大大加深，人民生活日趋恶化，内部的经济困难和政治困难日益增长。美国侵略者这种奴役和掠夺的政策不能不引起其伙伴们的极深刻的不满，使他们彼此之间的矛盾尖锐化并扩大起来。这些国家一直都是敢怒而不敢言的。现在，一方面由于美国“力量无敌”的神话在朝鲜战争中的破灭，另一方面由于美国好战分子一贯叫嚣的所谓“共产主义威胁”经事实证明并无根据，就使得这些国家的一部分资产阶级终于看到了：追随美国并无好处，反而等于自杀，从而增加了他们力图摆脱美国控制的所谓“采取较为独立的政策”的情绪。最近联合国第七届大会第三次会议的情形证明，这种不愿再受美国控制的情绪已经发展到了开始与美国公开对抗的程度了。
    从总的方面来看，朝鲜停战反映了当前国际形势中的真正力量对比，有利于和平民主阵营而不利于帝国主义侵略阵营。毛主席早在一九五一年十月二十三日中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议上的开会词中就已经指出：“我们的敌人眼光短浅，他们看不到我们这种国内国际伟大团结的力量，他们看不到由外国帝国主义欺负中国人民的时代，已由中华人民共和国的成立而永远宣告结束了。他们也看不到帝国主义称霸世界的时代，已由社会主义苏联的成立，已由中华人民共和国的成立，已由各人民民主国家的成立，已由中苏两个伟大国家在友好互助同盟条约基础上的巩固团结，已由整个和平民主阵营的巩固团结以及世界各国广大和平人民对于这个伟大阵营的深厚同情，而永远宣告结束了。我们的敌人看不到这些，他们还想欺负中华人民共和国，他们还想称霸世界。但是，同志们，我可以断定，他们的想法是狂妄的，是徒然的，是不可能达到目的的。与此相反，中华人民共和国是不能欺负的，以苏联为首的伟大和平阵营是不能侵犯的，全世界和平人民是不能欺骗的。”整个朝鲜战争的进程证实了毛主席的这种正确的分析。朝鲜停战的获得，是帝国主义军事冒险失败的结果，是朝中人民在以苏联为首的和平民主阵营以及全世界爱好和平人民的同情和支持之下获得了伟大胜利的结果。它再生动也没有地说明了帝国主义阵营内部由于实行战争政策而招致的日益加深的政治经济困难和分崩离析，也说明了整个和平民主阵营由于坚持和平建设政策而获得的政治经济实力日益增长和团结得坚如磐石。
    朝中人民正义斗争的胜利证明，在目前国际形势下，只有有关国家彼此进行和平协商，才是解决国际争端的唯一可能和正确的途径。三年多以前，美国反动统治集团撕毁莫斯科苏美英三国外长会议的决定，拒绝和平解决朝鲜问题，走上了军事冒险的道路。如今，朝鲜战场上的残酷现实证明这条道路已经无法走通，逼得他们只能接受停战，重新回到和平协商的道路上来解决朝鲜问题。这对于迷信用“实力政策”来解决国际争端的冒险家们是一次极重大的教训和警告，而对于各国人民争取和平解决国际争端的运动则是很大的鼓舞。一切爱好和平的人都会承认，为时三年有余而且极其激烈的朝鲜战争既然可以用协商方法获得停战，那么，现在任何国际未决的问题或争端，包括停战后的朝鲜问题在内，当然也就可能在有关各国相互协议的基础上谋取和平解决。由于朝鲜停战的成功，目前的国际形势更加有利于全世界人民争取和平的斗争；同时，由于帝国主义战争计划的挫折，以美国为首的侵略集团正在进行拚命的挣扎。因此，朝中人民和全世界一切爱好和平的人民，现在比任何时候更加需要进一步努力为缓和国际紧张局势、为世界和平而奋斗；同时，也更加需要严重警惕帝国主义者妄图阻挡和平车轮前进的阴谋。毫无疑问，在目前的力量对比的情况之下，正如苏联部长会议主席马林科夫同志所指出的，“只要各国人民警惕，并努力制止侵略者的计划的实现，那么，和平就一定会得到保证。”
      （三）
    中国人民志愿军力量的泉源及其获得胜利的根本原因，是伟大的抗美援朝斗争的正义性。
    中国人民志愿军是真正来自人民的、有着高度政治觉悟和高贵品质的军队。它继承了中国人民解放军的光辉传统。它是在爱国主义精神下教养起来的，是在尊敬和爱护其他民族的国际主义精神下教养起来的。它也是在保卫远东和世界和平的斗争中组成和壮大起来的。
    中国人民志愿军全体将士都普遍而深刻地认识到他们所进行的战争是正义的反侵略战争，代表着祖国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的意志和愿望；他们所执行的是保卫祖国安全、保卫朝鲜人民独立和自由、保卫远东和世界和平的伟大光荣的任务。因此，他们的士气非常旺盛，战斗意志非常昂扬。每个战士在战场上都表现了无比的勇敢坚强和主动机敏，表现了惊天动地的革命英雄主义和自我牺牲精神。三年来，志愿军中涌现出来三十多万个功臣，其中有很多像杨根思、黄继光、郭忠田、黄家富、孙占元、邱少云这样光辉的英雄和模范。他们的出色的英雄业迹，他们的勇敢、坚毅、顽强、无畏，为全世界人民发扬了正义的威力，将在世界人民保卫和平斗争的史册上万古流芳。
    由于正义和真理是在我们一边，由于对和平事业抱着根深蒂固的信心，所以，在朝鲜停战谈判过程中，我们的谈判代表们总是能够理直气壮、义正辞严地展开斗争并获得胜利。他们不倦不怠地揭发和打击敌人拖延、阻挠、以及破坏谈判的种种阴谋诡计，提出我们正直而合理的主张，使一切都黑白分明、是非判然。他们坚定而耐心地进行严肃的斗争，终于使这个史无前例的长期、复杂而尖锐的朝鲜停战谈判获得成功，为和平解决朝鲜问题打开了道路。
    三年来，中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军并肩作战，兄弟般地相互支持。我们与朝鲜人民一同战斗，一同生活，深知中朝人民唇齿相依，休戚与共。我们进一步认清了美国的侵略好战分子是中朝两国人民的共同死敌，深刻地体会到为了保家卫国，就必须抗美援朝。在三年的共同斗争当中，我军与朝鲜人民及朝鲜人民军之间用鲜血凝结起来的战斗友谊是更加巩固了，国际主义的感情是更加深厚了。我军在战斗的空隙中经常帮助朝鲜人民春耕秋收，修渠治水，植林造屋，防疫救灾。我军在过去一年当中，还从自己的给养中节约了一千多万斤粮食来接济朝鲜的灾民。我们在朝鲜，就如同在我们祖国一样，罗盛教烈士的榜样就是我们全军的国际主义觉悟的标志。而在金日成元帅领导之下的英雄的朝鲜人民也同样以无比的热情爱护和支援我军。朝鲜劳动党和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府无时不在关心我们，不断帮助我们。朝鲜人民自动地让房给我们住，借家具给我们用，帮我们运粮送水，输送伤员。像朴在根烈士那样舍命抢救我军伤员的深切感人的事迹，随处都有。这一切使我们深感朝鲜人民就同我们自己的兄弟姊妹一样，相处无间，亲同骨肉。朝鲜人民对于我军的爱护和支援，我们全军将士永远感念不忘。朝鲜人民的勇敢勤劳、艰苦卓绝的战斗精神，不仅鼓舞了我军战斗的勇气，并且深刻地教育了我军全体指挥员和战斗员，更加提高了他们的国际主义思想。我们深深以有这样的英勇勤劳的人民的邻邦而感到骄傲光荣。
    抗美援朝的斗争是对于我国人民的严重考验。现在，经过了三年斗争之后，人们可以看到，我国人民不仅很有成效地经受住了这个考验，而且是变得更加坚强了。我国人民从来没有像今天这样具备着高度的精神上和政治上的团结一致，我们各族人民之间的关系从来没有像今天这样友爱团结，我国人民的爱国主义精神从来没有像今天这样蓬勃昂扬。
    我们之所以能在朝鲜前线赢得了如此伟大的胜利，我国人民的全力支援起了非常重要的作用。三年来，在抗美援朝、保家卫国的口号之下，我们伟大祖国的人民一面进行着经济的巨大的恢复和建设工作，一面进行着伟大的抗美援朝运动来支援志愿军，使我们能够获得源源不绝的物质供应和正气磅礴的精神鼓舞，使我们得以顺利地打击侵略者，直到今天的胜利。我代表全军谨向全力支援我们的祖国人民表示衷心的感谢和敬意。我们满可以说，我国人民的热情的巨大的支援，将与我军的英勇斗争并列史册，在保卫远东和世界和平事业中建立了辉煌的功勋。
    全国各族各界人民空前踊跃地报名参加了志愿军，到处出现了母亲送儿子、妻子送丈夫、兄弟争相入伍的感人事迹，新的战斗力量不断地参加到志愿军的队伍中去。成千成万的铁路职工、汽车司机和民工纷纷到朝鲜前线去担任战地的各种运输与勤务工作，保证了战斗任务的胜利进行。医务工作者组织了大批医疗队为中朝部队服务。全国规模的慰问志愿军和朝鲜人民军运动，捐献武器运动和彻底粉碎美帝国主义细菌战的爱国卫生运动展开了，并且胜利地完成了这一切任务。
    工人阶级热烈响应毛主席“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的号召，提出了“工厂即战场、机器即枪炮”的战斗口号，开展了爱国主义的劳动竞赛，发挥了高度的生产积极性和创造性，保证了国家经济的恢复和发展，及时而充分地供应了前线庞大繁重的需要。
    农民们以开展爱国增产运动来支援我军的作战，使全国农业生产得以迅速恢复和超过历史上最高水平，对朝鲜前线的粮食供应提供了有力的保证。
    我国知识分子在支援前线的爱国事业中也不落后于工人阶级和农民。他们在抗美援朝运动中把我国的科学和文化教育向前推进，服务于国家建设，服务于祖国国防。
    我国其他阶层的爱国人士对于支持抗美援朝运动，也都有很大的贡献。
    全国人民进行了大规模的优待革命烈士家属、革命军人家属的工作，把优抚工作作为支援前线的重大任务。在“先军属、后自己”的口号下，各地城市和农村的人民都尽了很大努力，采取许多措施，以保证烈属军属的生活和生产，这样不仅鼓舞了烈属军属的生产积极性，而且直接鼓舞了前方将士的士气。
    抗美援朝运动使全国人民受到了爱国主义的和国际主义的教育，大大提高了民族自尊心和自信心，加强了同仇敌忾、打退美国侵略的决心。正是在这一思想基础上，产生了通过各方面来支援志愿军及朝鲜人民反抗侵略、保卫远东和平和世界和平的强大的物质力量。同时，抗美援朝运动所引起的祖国面貌的重大而深刻的改变，和人民政治觉悟和组织性的空前高涨，又转而成为鼓舞全军勇气百倍、愈战愈强的最重要的力量。
    中国共产党和各民主党派的各级组织，各人民团体以及各界爱国人士的坚强团结和努力工作，使抗美援朝爱国运动得以迅速开展并获得成绩。全国人民的一切努力，在中国共产党和我们伟大英明的领袖毛泽东主席的领导下，联合为一支巨大的洪流，冲破了一切困难，把抗美援朝斗争引向伟大的胜利。
    抗美援朝斗争的胜利是与我们伟大的盟邦苏联的支持和援助分不开的，是与各人民民主国家的支持和援助分不开的，是与全世界爱好和平的人民的支持和援助分不开的。三年多来，这些支持和援助
  一直在鼓舞着我军英勇地前进。我在这里代表全军向以苏联为首的民主阵营各兄弟国家和世界爱好和平的人民致以衷心的感谢和无限的敬意。我们要进一步加强与我们伟大盟邦苏联及各人民民主国家的友谊团结，更高地举起百战百胜的国际主义旗帜！
      （四）
    同志们！朝鲜停战现在已经实现了。取得了反侵略战争胜利的朝鲜人民，在金日成元帅的领导下，在朝鲜劳动党和政府的领导下，正在热烈响应着“一切为了加强民主基地，恢复和发展战后人民经济”的号召，为医治战争创伤、重建和平生活、加强武装力量、争取祖国和平统一而努力。中国人民衷心地祝贺朝鲜人民能早日胜利地完成这些伟大而复杂的艰巨任务。中国人民准备尽一切可能来援助朝鲜人民。中国人民志愿军全军将士把朝鲜人民面临的困难看作是自己的困难，将尽其最大的努力，以自己的劳动来帮助朝鲜人民克服困难，并以此为最光荣的任务。我深信，有着朝鲜劳动党和金日成元帅的坚强领导和以苏联为首的民主阵营各国支援的朝鲜人民，在解放后有过五年和平建设的经验、在三年战争中又证明了自己对于祖国具有无限忠诚和表现了勇于克服困难的英雄气概的朝鲜人民，今后在加强武装力量、重建和平生活的艰巨工作中，一定会进一步发挥巨大力量，取得新的光辉伟大的成就。谨祝朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的前途无限光明！
    但是朝鲜停战协定的签订，不过是和平解决朝鲜问题的开端。当前的任务是巩固朝鲜停战，保证严格遵守停战条款以严防侵略战争的再起，促成政治会议的顺利召开以进一步谋求朝鲜问题的和平解决。
    中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军一道，现在已经、将来也要继续严格地遵守并履行停战协定的一切规定。中国人民志愿军坚决拥护我国周恩来外长与朝鲜民主主义人民共和国南日外务相先后在八月二十四日及二十五日发表的关于政治会议问题的声明，和苏联政府出席联合国大会代表团维辛斯基团长八月二十五日在联合国大会政治委员会上所提的关于政治会议的成员的原则。中、朝、苏三国关于政治会议的态度，不仅完全符合于朝鲜停战协定第四条第六十款的原则，而且只有这样才能使政治会议在健全合理的基础上召开，并在召开之后在和谐的空气中进行，从而保证会议有成功的可能性。
    中朝两国对于停战协定的严格遵守和在政治会议问题上的合情合理态度，充分显示了中朝两国人民争取巩固朝鲜停战、开好政治会议、以便用协商方法谋求解决朝鲜问题的真诚愿望和重大努力。
    但是，中朝人民和一切爱好和平的人民不能不严重地注意到：美国侵略者正在有计划地使朝鲜停战保持不稳定状态，并竭力阻挠和破坏讨论和平解决朝鲜问题的政治会议的召开。在停战协定签订之前，美国侵略者已经纵容李承晚集团破坏了停战协定中关于战俘遣返的协议部分。在停战协定签订之后，美军破坏停战协定的事件仍在继续发生。美国国务卿杜勒斯在八月八日与李承晚签订所谓“共同防御条约”，规定美国有权无限期驻留军队在南朝鲜，同时并公开声明：如果在政治会议中达不到他们预定的目的的话，美国与李承晚将在政治会议召开三个月之后一同退出政治会议。美国政府并压迫参加侵朝战争的其他十五个国家和他们一道发表了所谓“十六国宣言”，以重新恢复朝鲜战争并使之不限于朝鲜境内的狂妄叫嚣来企图威胁中朝人民和世界人民。杜勒斯在他九月二日对美国退伍军人团代表大会的演说中，又重复了这种威胁。这样，美国政府在政治会议还未举行之前，便预先对政治会议就撤退外国军队及和平解决朝鲜问题的协商规定了无理的条件。
    为了便利操纵政治会议，美国政府以横蛮达于极点的手段，排斥印度和其他有关国家参加，迫使联合国大会通过了由他们包办提出的关于政治会议成员问题的所谓十五国提案，企图把政治会议变成板门店谈判的再版，以便替杜勒斯李承晚实行其九十天后退出政治会议的罪恶计划准备条件。美国统治集团这种横行霸道的事实，不能不引起世界人民对于即将举行的政治会议的严重警惕。
    美国海军继续侵占着我国领土台湾。美国好战分子们公然宣布继续反对我国在联合国和整个国际事务中应该享有的合法权利。美国政府竭力阻挠东西方之间的正常经济关系的恢复，继续对我国实行禁运和封锁。
    上面这一切事实都有力地说明：美国侵略者是不甘心于他们在朝鲜的失败的，他们的侵略野心并未放弃，疯狂的挑衅阴谋随时都有可能发生。
    必须严正警告美国的好战分子们，如果你们或你们的走狗李承晚集团敢于背信弃义地破坏朝鲜停战协定，再次发动侵略战争，那么，你们就一定会碰得头破血流。你们任何使政治会议流产和遭受破坏的阴谋，都必将遭受朝中人民和世界爱好和平人民最坚决的反对而遭受更严重的失败。
    中国人民志愿军全军将士将百倍警惕美国好战分子和李承晚集团的阴谋和挑衅，严守自己的阵地，准备随时粉碎敌人任何可能的突然侵犯，完成我们光荣的自卫任务。
    我们全军将士将认真总结三年战争两年谈判的经验，学习苏联的先进的军事科学，提高自己的军事政治水平，加强部队的战斗能力；将继续发扬国际主义精神，爱护朝鲜人民的利益，更加紧密地和朝鲜人民军一起严守停战线和朝鲜海防，巩固并加强与朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军之间的战斗友谊。
    同样，我们全国人民应该保持高度警惕，不能有丝毫的松懈麻痹；应该遵照中国共产党和中央人民政府的指示，大力完成并提前超额完成我们经济建设五年计划的第一年的任务，加强国防建设；同时还应该继续深入地开展抗美援朝运动，继续支援朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，直到朝鲜人民重建工作的完成，直到朝鲜问题得到和平解决为止。
    为了贯彻朝鲜停战协定的实施，为了争取朝鲜问题的和平解决，为了争取远东和平事业的更大胜利，让我们前线和后方更紧密地团结在一起，奋斗前进！为抗美援朝斗争而英勇牺牲的先烈们永垂不朽！伟大的抗美援朝斗争胜利万岁！中朝两国人民牢不可破的永久友谊万岁！以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营万岁！我们伟大的祖国和人民万岁！我们伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！
                     一九五三年九月十二日
