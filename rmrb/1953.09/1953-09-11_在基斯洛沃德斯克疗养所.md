    At the Kislovodsk Sanatorium
    Li He
    In Moscow, after Soviet doctors checked my health, they recommended that I go to a sanatorium in Kislovodsk.
    Soviet workers and students generally spend twelve days a year in a rest home, while those who are more tired or in poorer health spend twenty-six days in a sanatorium for rest and treatment. What makes the Soviet rest system so enviable is not only that people universally get rest, not only that the state bears most of the expenses of rest and recuperation, but also that the state has extensively established rest homes and sanatoriums to meet the needs of the broad masses. With these places of rest, people can fully utilize their annual vacation, wash away the fatigue accumulated during the year, and infuse their bodies with new vitality. Kislovodsk is one of the many sanatorium areas in the Soviet Union.
    The train from Moscow directly to Kislovodsk, passing through Kursk, Kharkov, and Rostov, took forty-five hours. When I left Moscow in mid-August, the leaves there were beginning to turn yellow, and the rain brought the feeling of autumn, but Kislovodsk still had the climate of late summer in the south. Along the way, the fertile grain-producing areas of Ukraine, the Don, and the North Caucasus had already finished harvesting. Local people said that this year's harvest was very good.
    Kislovodsk, Pyatigorsk, Zheleznovodsk, and Yessentuki are a string of resort cities in the southern part of the Stavropol Territory. This is the famous Caucasian Mineral Waters region. In the past five years, more than one million people have received treatment in this mineral water area. Not only Moscow, but also Leningrad, Kiev, Tbilisi, Baku, and other places have direct trains to here. When the train travels from the Stavropol Plain to this area, which is about sixty kilometers long and about thirty kilometers wide, you can only see verdant slopes and green mountains, and you unknowingly enter the highlands.
    Kislovodsk is located in a valley eight hundred and twenty to nine hundred and fifty meters above sea level. Forty magnificent and beautiful sanatoriums are surrounded by green trees at higher and lower elevations. They are organized by the Ministry of Health, trade unions, and various government departments. The vast park, many sanatoriums' own gardens, tree-lined roads, city medical institutions, shops, markets, and theaters all serve the people receiving treatment. One hundred and thirty years ago, there was no village here. Later, especially after the establishment of the Soviet regime, due to the development of sanatorium institutions, Kislovodsk became a famous city.
    I entered the sanatorium named after Stalin. This sanatorium, organized by the Ministry of Health, is located on a hillside behind the park. It has a three-story residential building and a two-story club. In front of it, under the canopy of locust and horse chestnut trees, next to flowerbeds and Stalin statues, you can overlook the opposite green mountains through the treetops of the park. This sanatorium can accommodate more than two hundred people. Like other sanatoriums in Kislovodsk, it works all year round. It accepts newcomers and sends away those who have recovered their health almost every day.
    Like other people in the sanatorium, I was under the care of a fixed doctor after entering the sanatorium. The next day, the doctor accepted the medical records I brought, examined my heart, and checked my blood pressure. Although I had a full body examination in Moscow, on the third day, I was re-examined for urine, stool, and blood, my chest was X-rayed, the activity of my heart was recorded with an electrical device, and my height and weight were measured. On the fourth day, a doctor came to diagnose, and then determined how to treat me. I was given a sanatorium manual, which stated what treatment I should receive. I was weighed every five days, and the doctor re-examined me once to check the effect of the treatment. Some people also take medicine, get injections, and receive physical therapy. The health of each person in the sanatorium is cared for in this way. More attention is paid to those with poorer health.
    Kislovodsk is famous for treating diseases of the heart and circulatory system, etc. In the sanatorium where I was, like other sanatoriums in Kislovodsk, there were people from all over the Soviet Union who came for treatment because of heart or blood pressure diseases or abnormalities. There were actors from Tbilisi, teachers from Baku, workers from the Stone Pass, students from Astrakhan, railway employees from Moscow, and pilots from Krasnoyarsk. There were also workers from Murmansk in the north and Sakhalin Island in the Far East. People from Sakhalin Island spent several months of vacation accumulated over three years here and elsewhere. In the Stalin Sanatorium, I unexpectedly met a Chinese student studying in the Soviet Union, who was of the Yi ethnic group. There were also three other Chinese students in two other sanatoriums. They were all treated favorably by the trade union in the Soviet school and came here for vacation during the summer vacation. Whether doctors or people receiving treatment, they all showed cordial concern for us Chinese. "Comrade, how do you feel?" "Comrade, are you used to it here?" "Comrade, you should gain some weight!" Everyone hoped that the Chinese comrades' bodies would be healthier, and everyone was worried that the Chinese comrades were too thin.
    Most of the people who come to Kislovodsk for treatment use "Narzan" mineral water for treatment. "Narzan" is the largest mineral spring in the Caucasian Mineral Waters region, producing an average of about 1.5 million liters of spring water per day, which is equal to a quarter of the total spring water output in the entire region. "Narzan" mineral water contains various mineral salts and carbonic acid gas, and small bubbles like beads emerge from the water. It has been used for treatment for more than a hundred years, but it has only been used extensively in the Soviet era, and the people can enjoy it. Kislovodsk got its name and developed because of this mineral spring containing carbonic acid gas.
    The doctor asked me to drink half a cup of mineral water two or three times a day by the mineral spring, and told me to drink one of the mineral waters called dolomite, and to warm it up. I have also seen "Narzan" in soda bottles in Moscow, but it is best to drink it by the spring, because at this time the physical and chemical properties of the mineral water are preserved.
    The doctor also allowed me to have a mineral water bath every other day. Some sanatoriums have their own mineral water bathhouses. Most of the people in the sanatorium go to the "Narzan Main Bathhouse" and the "Narzan October Bathhouse" on Stalin Street for mineral water baths. The former was established in 1903 and has sixty-six bathrooms and other mineral water medical equipment, and the latter was established in 1928 and has sixty bathrooms. Each bathroom has an individual bathtub. One end of the bathtub is equipped with a heat transfer iron ring device. After the bathhouse workers put mineral water into the bathtub, they put the heat transfer device into the water and adjust the water to the appropriate temperature according to the doctor's instructions on each person's sanatorium manual. The thermometer is installed on the wooden pole in the hand of the bathhouse worker. The mineral water prepared for me was thirty-six degrees. According to the doctor's pre-instructions, I kept my chest exposed to the water surface and quietly soaked in the water. At this time, countless small water droplets were clinging to all the pores of my skin, and I felt comfortable all over. A doctor came in to check my pulse in the middle of the bath. When the small light bulb on the wall lit up, or the sand timer had filled a certain grid, I would get out of the bath. The first time I was only allowed to bathe for five minutes, and then gradually increase by one minute each time. The longest was no more than fifteen minutes. After the bath, I would lie quietly in the rest hall for fifteen to twenty minutes, and then return to the sanatorium to rest. For sanatoriums that are far away, they are sent back by car after the bath. People who have mineral water baths are prohibited from traveling or doing other activities that are easy to cause fatigue on this day.
    Mineral water is also used to treat diseases of the nose, throat, and gynecology.
    In addition to mineral springs, the climate in Kislovodsk is mild. In summer, there are often short rains to wash the air and dissipate the heat. Autumn is sunny and refreshing.
    Many people in the sanatorium like the quiet environment of Kislovodsk. There are few streets here, sparse traffic, but the parks are vast and beautiful. People take walks and relax in the park every day. The old part of the park includes the banks of the Xiaohe River, with hundred-year-old trees standing tall along the banks; the new part of the park extends to the hillside. The lush branches and leaves of pine, cypress, fir, oak, locust, chestnut, poplar, mulberry, and linden trees form layers of natural canopies above the park. People walking under their shade do not need to wear straw hats on sunny days, and do not need to wear raincoats in light rain. The strong sunlight becomes light and soft through the gaps in these canopies. Summer rain and autumn wind here only add the fresh atmosphere of grass and trees and the rustling of the trees. On moonlit nights, silver light is sprinkled on the avenues and paths crisscrossed by tree shadows. All this regulates the recuperative mood of people from all over the country.
    Air treatment and gymnastics treatment are commonly used in sanatoriums. People are encouraged to walk, travel, sunbathe, and air bathe more in the air.
  (Air bath is lying naked on a wooden bed in a shaded field during warm weather without wind, the field is surrounded by wooden boards). The men and women in the sanatorium, with very few exceptions, participate in gymnastics. Some people participate in morning gymnastics, and some people do special gymnastics in the gym that are suitable for their physical condition. The sanatorium has sports instructors who teach gymnastics and organize the sports of the people in the sanatorium.
    The life of the people in the sanatorium is regular and active. We get up at seven o'clock every morning in our sanatorium. We take naps and sleep on time. We eat at eight to nine in the morning, one to two in the afternoon, and seven to eight in the evening every day, tea at five in the afternoon, and a cup of sour milk at ten in the evening. The first floor of the club is the sanatorium's dining hall. Each person has a fixed seat. Order the next day's dishes from the menu on the first day. The diet is richer and more diverse than at home, and suitable for the needs of the people in the sanatorium. The doctor inspects the kitchen and dining hall every day. There are entertainment programs every night; movies are shown every other day, as well as musical concerts, dances, and lectures. Allowed to go to the theater. Trips are often organized. The sanatorium has a cultural organizer responsible for organizing cultural and entertainment life. The sanatorium has its own library and reading room.
    Sanatoriums are of significant help to people's health. Almost everyone's complexion is better when they go back, their physical functions have improved, and their weight has increased. In the Kislovodsk Sanatorium, I felt that the characteristic of Soviet sanatoriums is that they use all the external recuperation environment and conditions to influence and improve people's health, and all the external recuperation environment and conditions do not only act on a certain part of people's bodies, but on their whole bodies.

    在基斯洛沃德斯克疗养所
    李何
    在莫斯科，苏联医生检查我的健康情况后，推荐我到基斯洛沃德斯克的疗养所去。
    苏联的职工和学生一般每年到休养所休息十二天，较累的或者健康稍差的到疗养所休息和治疗二十六天。苏联这种休息制度令人羡慕的地方，不仅在于人们普遍得到休息，不仅在于休养和疗养的费用大部分由国家负担，而且在于国家广泛地设立了满足广大人民需要的休养所和疗养所。有了这些休息所在，人们能够充分地利用每年一度的假期，涤洗一年中积累的疲劳，向自己身体灌输新的活力。基斯洛沃德斯克是苏联许多疗养区中的一个。
    莫斯科直达基斯洛沃德斯克的火车，经过库尔斯克、哈尔科夫、罗斯托夫，走了四十五个钟头。八月半离开莫斯科时，那里树叶开始转黄，阴雨带来秋意，但是基斯洛沃德斯克还是南方晚夏的气候。一路上，乌克兰、顿河、北高加索的富庶产谷区都已经收割完毕。当地人们说，今年收成很好。
    基斯洛沃德斯克和毕之高尔斯克、热列兹诺沃德斯克、埃森图其，是斯塔甫罗波尔边区南部的一串疗养城市。这就是著名的高加索矿泉区。最近五年中在这个矿泉区疗养的有一百多万人。不但莫斯科，而且列宁格勒、基辅、第比利斯、巴库等地都有火车直达这里。当火车由斯塔甫罗波尔平原驰骋在这个长约六十公里、宽约三十公里的地带时，只见翠绿的坡地和碧青的山峦，不觉进到高地来。
    基斯洛沃德斯克处在拔海八百二十到九百五十公尺的谷地里，在高处和低处，绿荫的树木包围着四十多座宏伟和秀丽的疗养所。它们是卫生部、工会和政府各部举办的。广大的公园、许多疗养所自己的花园、林荫道，市上的医疗机关、商店、市场、旅馆、戏院，都是为疗养的人们服务的。一百三十年前此地还没有村落。后来，特别是苏维埃政权建立以后，由于疗养机关的发展，基斯洛沃德斯克才成为有名的城市。
    我进了以斯大林为名的疗养所，这个卫生部举办的疗养所座落在公园侧背的山坡上。它有三层楼的住屋和二层楼的俱乐部。在它面前华盖的槐树和野栗树下，花坛和斯大林塑像旁边，透过公园的林梢，可以眺望对面的青山。这个疗养所可以容纳二百多人疗养。和基斯洛沃德斯克其他疗养所一样，它是常年工作的。它差不多每天接受新来的和送走恢复了健康的人们。
    像别的疗养人们一样，我进疗养所后就在固定医生的关照底下。第二天，医生接受了我带来的病历，诊察了我的心脏，检查了我的血压。虽然在莫斯科已经全身检验过，第三天还是重新检验了大小便、血，用X光透视了胸部，用电机记录了心脏活动情况，量了身高和体重。第四天来了博士诊断，然后确定怎样治疗。发给一本疗养手册，上面注明我应受什么治疗。每五天称体重一次，医生重新诊察一次，检查治疗的效果。有的人还吃药、打针、理疗。对每个疗养的人的健康，都是这样关心的。对健康更差的人，关注更多一些。
    基斯洛沃德斯克以治心脏和血脉系统等疾病出名。在我所在的疗养所，和基斯洛沃德斯克其他疗养所一样，有因为心脏或血压的疾病或不正常从苏联各地来疗养的人们。有第比利斯的演员、巴库的教员、石山口的工人、阿斯特拉罕的学生、莫斯科的铁路职员、克拉斯诺雅尔斯克的飞行员。也有从北方摩尔曼斯克和远东库页岛来疗养的职工。从库页岛来的人，把三年积下来的几个月假期在这里和别处渡过。在斯大林疗养所，我不期遇到了我国在苏联学习的一位留学生，他是彝族。在另外两个疗养所还有三个中国留学生。他们都是受到苏联学校里工会的优待，在暑假来此地休养的。不论医生还是疗养的人们，对于我们中国人，都表现着亲切的关怀。“同志，你的身体觉得怎样？”“同志，你过得惯吗？”“同志，你要吃胖些呀！”每个人都在希望中国同志的身体养得好些，每个人都为中国同志太瘦而操心。
    到基斯洛沃德斯克疗养的人，绝大部分利用“纳尔藏”矿泉来治疗。“纳尔藏”是高加索矿泉区的最大矿泉，平均一昼夜出泉水约一百五十万公升，等于全区矿泉出水量的四分之一。“纳尔藏”矿泉水含有各种矿盐和炭酸气体，水里冒着小珠似的气泡。它被用来治疗已经有一百多年历史，但在苏维埃时代才大量地被利用，人民才能享受到。基斯洛沃德斯克就是以这种含有炭酸气体的矿泉得名和发展起来的。
    医生要我每天两三次到矿泉边饮矿水大半杯，并且告诉我要饮其中一种叫做白云石的矿水，并且要温过的。在莫斯科也见过装在汽水瓶里的“纳尔藏”，但以在泉边喝为最好，因为这时矿水所含的物理和化学性能都保全着。
    医生也允许我进行隔日一次的矿水浴。有些疗养所有自己的矿水浴室。大部分疗养所的疗养人们到斯大林街的“纳尔藏总浴堂”和“纳尔藏十月浴堂”进行矿水浴，前者是在一九○三年建立的，有六十六个浴室和其他矿水医疗设备，后者是在一九二八年建立的，有六十个浴室。每个浴室有一个个人浴盆。浴盆的一端设有传热铁圈的装置。浴堂女工把矿水放入浴盆后，把传热装置放到水里，根据各人疗养手册上医生的指示，把水调节到适当的温度。温度计就装在女工手里的木杆上。给我准备的矿水是三十六度。根据医生的预先指点，我把胸部露在水面，全身静静地泡在水中。这时皮肤的所有毛孔上衔着无数小水珠，浑身舒泰。在浸浴中间有医生进来诊脉。当墙上的小灯泡燃亮，或者沙表流满一定格位时，就出浴。第一次只许浴五分钟，然后逐次增加一分钟。最长的不超过十五分钟。浴罢到休息厅静卧十五到二十分钟，然后回到疗养所休息。较远的疗养所，浴后用汽车送回去。进行矿水浴的人，这一天禁止旅行或作其他容易疲劳的活动。
    矿泉水还用来治疗鼻喉科和妇科的疾病。
    除了矿泉以外，基斯洛沃德斯克的气候是柔和的。夏天经常有短雨涤洗空气和打散热度。秋天是晴爽的。
    许多疗养人们都喜欢基斯洛沃德斯克的安静环境。这里街道少，车辆稀，公园却广大而漂亮。人们每天在公园里散步和休憩。公园的旧部分包括小山河的河岸，岸旁耸立着百多年的大树；公园的新部分扩展到山坡上。松、柏、枞、橡、槐、栗、杨、桑、菩提等大小树木的茂盛枝叶，在公园上空形成层层天然的帐幕。在它们的荫盖下散步的人们，晴天不用戴草帽，下小雨不用穿雨衣。强烈的日光透过这些帐幕的空隙变得轻淡柔和。夏雨秋风在这里增添的只是草木的清氛和树林的籁响。月夜里，银光洒在树影纵横的大道小径上。这一切调剂着各地来人的疗养心情。
    疗养所普遍采用着空气治疗和体操治疗。人们被鼓励多在空气中散步、旅行、日光浴和空气浴
  （空气浴是在没有风的暖和时候，光身躺在林荫的场子的木床上，场子围着木板）。疗养的男男女女，除了极少例子，都参加体操。有些人参加早晨体操，有些人在健身房进行适合于他们身体情况的特别体操。疗养所有体育指导员教导体操和组织疗养人们的运动。
    疗养人们的生活是有规则和活跃的。我们疗养所每天上午七点起床。按时午睡和睡觉。每天上午八—九时，中午一—二时，下午七—八时吃饭，下午五时茶点，晚上十时一杯酸牛奶。俱乐部的第一层就是疗养所的饭堂。每人有一定的坐位。凭菜单第一天点第二天菜。饮食比家常丰富、多样，适合疗养人们的需要。医生每天到厨房和食堂巡视。每晚都有娱乐节目；隔天放映一次电影，还有音乐演奏会、跳舞晚会、演讲。允许到戏院去。时常组织旅行。疗养所有文化组织员负责组织文化娱乐生活。疗养所有自己的图书阅览室。
    疗养所对人们的健康有显著的帮助。几乎每个人在回去时气色都好了，身体机能有进步，体重增加了。在基斯洛沃德斯克疗养所中，我感觉到了，苏联疗养所的特点在于：它们利用外在的全部疗养环境和条件来影响和改进人们的健康，而外在的全部疗养环境和条件，不是只作用于人们身体的某一部分，而是作用于他们的全身的。
          八月二十五日于基斯洛沃德斯克
