    A Brief Discussion of My Understanding of Mathematics
    Hua Luogeng
    A reporter from People's Daily asked me to talk about my love for mathematics and my understanding of mathematics, which might be helpful to young readers—especially college students who are about to enter mathematics majors and other majors that require studying mathematics. Therefore, I will make an introduction in this article. However, my understanding of mathematics has been a tortuous process, which had to be the case due to the resistance of the old society. Therefore, it can only serve as a reference for today's happy young people who are advancing by leaps and bounds under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.
    In the old days, young people aged fourteen or fifteen were ignorant of the needs of the motherland. At the same time, the old society was also cold and ruthless. Who cared where a dropout went! At that time, as soon as you dropped out of school, it was as if you had disappeared from the memories of the teachers and classmates who could go to higher schools! It was also dropping out of their so-called "progressive" ranks! Even now, I can still clearly recall the arrogant and disdainful expressions of those "promising" old classmates—new high school students—passing by in the small shop. In such an environment, of course no one would help you to study on your own or guide you on the road to learning. In such a self-destructive environment, my choice of mathematics certainly did not take into account the needs of the motherland (although there were some vague feelings at the time). At that time, the only force driving me to learn was interest and convenience, because mathematics is a science full of interest and also the most convenient science for self-study.
    My knowledge at that time was limited to arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and trigonometry in junior high school. From arithmetic and algebra, I realized that in mathematics, higher-level knowledge has the effect of turning difficulties into ease. Arithmetic's four arithmetic problems are ever-changing, making people rack their brains; but once you understand algebra, it becomes extremely easy. According to a principle and following a certain method, you can solve a variety of problems. This encouraged me to learn at a higher level, which was the original driving force for me to learn more profound mathematics. In geometry, I encountered rigorous reasoning for the first time—deriving all theorems from a simple minority of basic assumptions. In junior high school, no other course was more convincing than this one. Geometry not only has a complete theory, but also has great practical value when combined with trigonometry.
    In short, in those years, I discovered that mathematics has the nature of gradually deepening. Every time you go deeper, and then look back at the problem, you feel that the more you look at it, the easier it becomes. Therefore, although some parts of the textbooks at that time were not well written, and they were a bit dry and boring when I first read them, I still learned deeper and deeper, and the more I learned, the more motivated I became, and finally I forged an indissoluble bond with mathematics.
    Of course, mathematics is not the only thought-provoking subject, but compared with other subjects, mathematics is indeed the most suitable for self-study. It has the clearest outline, and everything else can be deduced from the simplest few assumptions. As long as you proceed in an orderly manner, don't take the next step if you don't understand one step, and review frequently, you can gradually go deeper; you can know whether it is right or wrong by verification, and there is only one answer, making it easiest to find mistakes. It also does not require experimental equipment. A piece of paper, a pen, and a few books are all you need to start working. And these were the conditions I could meet when I dropped out of school and stayed at home.
    Therefore, I started learning mathematics without any "grand ambitions," just for interest and for the convenience of self-study. This kind of thinking dominated me for fifteen or sixteen years.
    My first eye-opening experience was when I visited the Soviet Union in 1946. At that time, I was amazed at how much this country valued mathematics. I still remember that in a meeting with Kubulatze, the Minister of Education of the Georgian Republic, when he told me the proportion of students in the mathematics department of Soviet universities, I was taken aback. I asked him: With so many students in the mathematics department, what about their future? The background of my question was: In the old China under the control of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, only twenty or thirty students graduated from the mathematics department every year, and they were still struggling with the problem of finding a job. Therefore, I asked a question that seems very naive today. Minister Kubulatze—who was also a mathematician—replied, "You are a mathematics student, don't you know how useful mathematicians are?" I am ashamed to say that at that time, I really did not know what mathematicians were useful for. For the sake of my own "face," I didn't have the courage to ask another question. But at least my eyes were opened, and I knew that in the Soviet Union, mathematicians were needed by the state in large numbers.
    Inspired by this, I began to pay attention to the relationship between mathematics and society. I found that in capitalist countries, many mathematics workers have become accomplices or henchmen of war-mongers. This startled me! It made me realize that the study of mathematics cannot remain at the level of "for the sake of interest," and that mathematics is closely related to society and the country. It can become a tool for building the motherland, or it can become a tool for war-mongers. Scientists must have a stand.
    Even so, I was still not very clear about how mathematics should serve the motherland. At the beginning of this year, I had the opportunity to participate in the Chinese Academy of Sciences' delegation to the Soviet Union. This study trip to the Soviet Union furthered my understanding of the reason why the Soviet Union valued mathematics. In the past, I only knew that many scientific departments needed mathematics, but only a very few departments needed advanced mathematics. What I saw in the Soviet Union this time was very different. I saw many scientists using mathematics as a powerful assistant in their research work, and even more mathematicians grasping this "key to open the treasure house of science" and delving into other scientific departments. There are countless examples of the former, such as mechanics, astronomy, and theoretical physics, not to mention that the scope of application of mathematics has also expanded to disciplines such as meteorology and seismology; in engineering science, using mathematics to improve the theoretical level and accurate calculations in advance can reduce a lot of groping time and save a lot of experimental equipment. Regarding the latter, there are brilliant examples of Academician Lavrentyev and Academician Sobolev, who mastered mathematics and entered the field of seismology, Academician Kolmogorov entered the study of fluid mechanics, Academician Keldysh entered the pioneering work of mechanics, and even more mathematicians entered theoretical physics, meteorology, and other departments. Soviet mathematicians also mentioned that people with mathematical training are more likely to gradually deepen their thinking and easily distinguish between primary and secondary issues.
    These facts awakened me! Mathematics is a subject that can make great contributions to society. In the past, the phenomenon of mathematics having no use was due to our social environment and subjective reasons for not wanting to be related to practice.
    In essence, the more developed science and production are, the more urgent the need for mathematics is; the more natural science is elevated to the theoretical stage, the more mathematics is needed. In the semi-feudal and semi-colonial old China, to be a comprador or to serve a comprador, you only needed some addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and logarithms for calculating compound interest; to calculate fields, you only needed some simple geometry. This explains why mathematics in capitalist countries is far superior to that in semi-colonial and semi-feudal old China, and on the other hand, it also explains why socialist countries need mathematics more urgently than capitalist countries. As our motherland begins to embark on the road to industrialization, the state's need for mathematics workers will definitely increase sharply. In its essence, this phenomenon has already begun today, and the positions of mathematics workers across the country are showing a surprisingly empty phenomenon.
    My talking about mathematics in this way does not hope to create a misconception in the minds of young people in our country that only mathematics is the most important science. This is not the case. We must pay attention to the fact that in our country, which is gradually transitioning to socialism, every department in the construction plan is important and indispensable. Just like a huge machine, not a single screw can be missing. Mathematics, like other disciplines, is urgently needed and indispensable in our country's construction cause. For the sake of the motherland, young people in our country must master this indispensable discipline, not to mention that it is such a fascinating and useful discipline.

    略谈我对数学的认识
    华罗庚
    人民日报的记者向我提起：谈一谈我对数学的爱好和我对于数学的认识，或将有助于青年读者—特别是即将进入数学专业及必须学习数学的其他专业的大学生们。因此我就在这篇文章里作一介绍。但是，我对数学的认识过程是迂回曲折的，是由于旧社会的阻力不得不如此的，所以它对今天在中国共产党正确领导下大步前进的幸福的青年们，仅能做一参考而已。
    在旧时代里，十四五岁的青年，对于祖国的需要是茫然无知的。同时，旧社会也是冷酷无情的，谁关心一个失学青年往那儿走！那时，只要你一失学，就等于从老师们及从能够升学的同学们的记忆中消失了！也就是从他们所谓的“上进”的队伍中掉队了！直到现在，我还能够清晰地回忆起当年在小店中眼看着那些“飞黄腾达”的旧日同窗——新入高中的老同学们趾高气扬昂然不屑一顾而过的神情。在那样的环境中，当然不会有人帮助你自修，指导你学习的道路的。在那样自生自灭的环境里，我选择了数学当然不会考虑到祖国的需要（虽然当时也有一些模糊的感觉）。那时唯一推动我学习的力量，就是兴趣和方便，因为数学是充满了兴趣的科学，也是最便于自学的科学。
    我当时的知识仅限于初中的算术、代数、几何和三角。从算术和代数中，我体会到，在数学中，高一级的知识有化难为易的作用。算术中的四则问题，千变万化，使人绞尽脑汁；但是懂得了代数，它就变为极其平易。根据一个原则，遵循一定的方法，就可以解决多种多样的问题。这鼓励了我向高处学，这是我学习更精深的数学的原动力。在几何学中，我第一次碰到了严格的推理——从简单的少数的基本假设，推出一切定理。在初中，再也没有比这一门课程更具有说服力的了。几何不但有完整的理论，并且和三角结合在一起，也有极大的实用价值。
    总之，在当年我发现了数学具有逐步深化的性质，每深入一步，再回头看问题，便觉得愈看愈容易。因之，尽管当时的教科书有些部分没有写好，初读时有些枯燥乏味，但我还是愈学愈深，愈学愈有劲，终于和数学结下了不解之缘。
    当然，耐人寻味的学科不止是数学，但和其他学科比较起来，数学确是最宜于自修的。它有最清楚的纲领，由最简单的少数假设就可以推出其他的一切。只要循序前进，一步不懂，不走下步，并且经常复习，就能够逐步深入；对与不对，验算便知，答案只有一个，发现错误最易。它也不需要实验器材，一张纸、一枝笔、少数书籍，就可以开始工作。而这就是当年我失学在家所能具备的条件了。
    所以，我开始学习数学是没有什么“宏愿”的，仅仅是为了兴趣，为了便于自学。这样的思想支配着我，我一直搞了十五六年。
    我第一次开眼界是在一九四六年访问苏联的时候。当时我对于这个国家那样重视数学感到惊异。我还记得，在和格鲁吉亚共和国教育部部长库柏拉特兹的一次会晤中，当他告诉我苏联大学数学系学生所占的比例时，我不禁大吃一惊。我问他：这么多的数学系的学生，他们的出路怎么办？我问这句话的背景是：旧中国在蒋匪帮的控制下，全国数学系每年毕业的学生不过二三十人，还在闹出路问题，因之我发出了今天看来十分幼稚的问题。库柏拉特兹部长——他也是数学家——却回答我说：“您是一个学数学的，难道不知道数学家是多么有用吗？”说来惭愧，当时我真的并不认识数学家到底有什么用处。顾惜自己的“面子”，我也没有勇气再追问一句。但我总算开了眼界，知道在苏联数学家是大量地为国家所需要的。
    受了这次启发，我便开始注意数学和社会的关系。我发现在资本主义的国家里有不少数学工作者做了战争贩子的同谋者或帮凶。这使我惊醒了！使我认识到研究数学不能停留在“为了兴趣”上，认识到数学是和社会、国家有着密切关系的，它可以成为建设祖国的工具，也可以成为为战争贩子们帮凶的工具。科学家必须有立场。
    虽然如此，我对数学究竟应当怎样为祖国服务，还是不很了然的。今年年初，我有机会参加了中国科学院的访苏代表团。这次到苏联学习，我才进一步地认识到苏联重视数学的道理。以往我只知道很多科学部门需要数学，但只有极少数的部门需要高深数学。这次在苏联所见到的，就大不相同了。我看到了不少科学家把数学当做他们研究工作的得力助手，更有不少数学家掌握了这“打开科学宝库的钥匙”，深入到其他科学部门的范例。关于前者可以举出无数例证，如力学、天文、理论物理等固不必说，数学应用的范围还扩充到了气象、地震等学科；在工程科学中用数学来提高理论水平，预先的精确计算，可以减少不少摸索的时间，节省不少实验的器材。关于后者有拉符抡捷夫及索波列夫院士的光辉例子，他们掌握了数学而进入了地震学领域，阔尔莫郭洛夫院士进入了流体力学的研究，开尔陀什院士进入了力学的开创性的工作，更有不少数学家进入理论物理、气象学等等部门。苏联的数学家们还提起：有了数学训练的人，他们的思想容易逐步深入，容易辨别主从。
    这些事实使我觉醒了！数学是可能对社会有极大贡献的学问。以往数学无用武之地的现象，是由于我们的社会环境及不肯和实际相联系的主观原因在作祟。
    实质上，科学和生产愈发达，对数学的需要也就愈迫切；在自然科学愈提高到理论阶段的时候，也就愈是需要数学的时候。在半封建半殖民地的旧中国，要做买办或为买办服务，只需要一些加减乘除及计算复利的对数而已；为了要计算田亩，也只需要一些简单的几何。这说明了为什么资本主义国家的数学远优于半殖民地半封建的旧中国的道理，另一方面也说明了社会主义国家对数学需要之急又超过了资本主义国家的道理。在我们祖国开始走上工业化的道路的时候，国家对于数学工作者的需要一定是会突增的。从它的实质上来说，这一现象今天已经开始了，现在全国数学工作者的岗位，显现了空虚得惊人的现象。
    我这样地谈到数学，并不希望在我国青年们的思想上造成一种错觉，认为只有数学才是最重要的科学。这并不是事实。我们必须注意，正在逐步地过渡到社会主义的我们的国家里，建设计划中的任何一个部门都是重要的，不可或缺的。诚如硕大无朋的机器，不能少掉一个螺丝钉。数学在我国的建设事业中正和其他学科一样，是迫切需要的，不可或缺的。为了祖国，我国青年必须掌握这一门必不可少的学科，何况它是如此引人入胜而且十分有用的学科。
