    The Cooperative in Yueqing County, Zhejiang Province is Too Irresponsible Regarding the Promotion of Improved Varieties
    A letter from Wang Deba, Agricultural and Forestry Science of Yueqing County, Zhejiang Province: During the spring plowing season this year, the cooperative in our county supplied farmers with over 150,000 jin of early rice "Zhenong 503" improved varieties; however, other rice varieties were mixed into this batch of improved varieties, causing serious losses to local agricultural production. Because the improved varieties and the mixed rice varieties matured at different times, some matured as much as ten days apart. According to investigations in various places, fields planted with this batch of improved varieties still had an average of 16% green ears (unripe rice ears) per mu at the time of rice maturity. If we calculate that five jin of rice seeds are sown per mu, the batch of improved varieties supplied by the cooperative could plant more than 20,000 mu of land, and the amount of grain reduced as a result is very large. The Yueqing County Cooperative has had similar problems in the past in its work of promoting improved varieties. Last winter, most of the alfalfa seeds supplied by the cooperative to farmers were infected with damping-off bacteria, so many alfalfa plants withered this year, some even withered more than 80%. The above situation has caused serious losses to farmers, alienated the cooperative from the masses, and affected the future promotion of improved varieties.
    The Yueqing County Cooperative should conduct a deep self-criticism of its irresponsible work style in the promotion of improved varieties, and earnestly correct it in future work; units responsible for promoting improved varieties in various places should also pay special attention to strengthening inspection work to prevent similar phenomena from occurring.

### 浙江乐清县合作社对推广良种工作太不负责

    浙江乐清县合作社对推广良种工作太不负责
    浙江省乐清县农林科汪德霸来信：我县合作社在今年春耕期间供应农民早稻“浙农五○三”良种十几万斤；但是这批良种中却混入了其它稻种，使当地农业生产受到严重损失。因为良种和混入的稻种成熟时间不一，有的先后相差达十几天。据各地调查结果，栽种这批良种的田，在稻谷成熟时，每亩平均还有百分之十六的青穗（未成熟的稻穗）。如果以一亩田下稻种五斤计算，合作社所供应的这批良种约可种植二万余亩田，因此而减产的粮食数量是很大的。乐清县合作社过去在推广良种工作中也曾发生过这样的问题。去年冬季该社供应农民的黄花苜蓿籽种大部分带有立枯病病菌，所以今年黄花苜蓿干枯的很多，有的甚至干枯了百分之八十以上。以上情况，已使农民受到严重损失，使合作社脱离了群众，并影响了今后的良种推广工作。
    乐清县合作社对推广良种工作中的不负责任作风应作深刻检讨，并在今后工作中切实改正；各地负责推广良种的单位也应该特别注意加强检验工作，以防止类似现象的发生。
