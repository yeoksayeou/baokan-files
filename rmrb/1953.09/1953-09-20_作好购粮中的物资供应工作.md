Do a Good Job in Material Supply During Grain Purchase

The autumn grain and major cash crop purchasing work has already begun. This is an extremely important task in the nation's economic life at present. The success or failure of the grain purchase work directly affects the storage of the nation's material reserves, the food needs of urban residents, the improvement of farmers' lives, the expansion of the domestic market, and the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance, among a series of major issues. Therefore, the autumn grain purchase work must be done well.

To do a good job in grain purchase, there must be a correct price policy and the necessary economic and political work. This year, the new cotton-grain price ratio, the new grain purchase prices, the "premium for quality" and "accepting both good and inferior" methods, and other corresponding measures stipulated by the state are entirely in line with the interests of the peasants. As long as we do the necessary economic and political work on the basis of a correct price policy, especially material supply work, we will certainly be able to do a good job in grain purchase. In our country, where the small-scale peasant economy dominates, the main form of economic connection between peasants and cities is through commodity exchange, i.e. buying and selling. Farmers sell grain in order to buy the goods they need. If we cannot meet the farmers' needs for goods, their interest in selling surplus grain will be reduced, and their actions to sell surplus grain will be delayed. Especially since the land reform, with successive years of good harvests, the lives of most peasants have improved, and their need for goods has increased, which further increases the importance of doing a good job in material supply work to attract peasants to sell surplus grain.

However, not all grain work and commercial work personnel fully understand the importance of doing a good job in material supply in grain purchase work. Many cadres still regard grain purchase work as a simple administrative task, as just a work of asking farmers for grain. They do not understand that purchasing farmers' surplus grain and supplying farmers with means of production and means of livelihood are an important part of the national commercial work and cooperative work, and are important measures to connect the urban and rural economies. On the one hand, it is to serve agricultural production, to help farmers sell their surplus grain as soon as possible, and use this income to expand production and improve farmers' lives. Therefore, we should fully meet the needs of farmers in this regard as much as possible. In the past, many places had poor material supply, so that some farmers could not buy the goods they needed even after they got the money. This is an extremely profound lesson. We must ensure that we both purchase farmers' grain in a timely manner and fully supply the goods farmers need in this year's grain purchase. On the other hand, it is also to serve urban industrial production, vigorously promote urban industrial products, and expand the market for industrial products. Chairman Mao taught us:

"The peasant – this is the main body of China's industrial market. Only they can provide the most abundant food and raw materials, and absorb the largest amount of industrial products." ("On Coalition Government") The development of industry in our country mainly relies on the domestic market, first of all the vast rural market. If the national industry does not sell its products to the rural market, it cannot obtain the supply of grain and raw materials from the rural market; without the supply of grain and raw materials, industry cannot exist and develop. In the past, many grain purchase workers did not have a sufficient understanding of the significance of this work, or did not actively open up sources of goods, or the supply of industrial products was inappropriate, which also hindered the grain purchase and material supply work. Therefore, in the future, we must first recognize the important significance of grain purchase work in order to do a good job in grain purchase and material supply work, ensure the completion of the grain purchase task, and further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.

In order to do a good job in material supply work, many specific measures must be taken. First of all, state-owned commercial departments and cooperatives in various places are required to, under the unified leadership of the local Financial and Economic Committee, conscientiously estimate the purchasing power of farmers, and formulate supply plans realistically according to the specific types, specifications, and quality of goods needed by farmers in the grain-producing areas. Based on this, continue to open up sources of goods and expand the purchase of industrial products. In opening up sources of goods, we should not only pay attention to the procurement of products from large cities and large industries, but also pay great attention to the procurement and promotion of local industrial products suitable for the needs of the local people, and actively help these enterprises improve product quality and reduce costs, so that they can produce more cheap and good-quality goods to supply the needs of the market. Because handicrafts have a large sales volume in rural areas, accounting for 60 to 80 percent of the total industrial products purchased by farmers, cooperatives in various places should strengthen the combination with local handicraft production according to needs and possibilities, supply the raw materials needed for handicraft production through the signing of supply and marketing contracts, and actively promote their products. In material supply work, special attention should be paid to strengthening the supply of autumn fertilizers and the supply of agricultural tools needed by farmers for autumn harvest and autumn planting.

Another important link in ensuring the successful completion of autumn material supply is to do a good job in material allocation and transportation. Our country has a vast area, inconvenient transportation, and a scattered rural environment. If allocation and transportation are not done well, the timely supply of materials cannot be guaranteed. In the past, improper allocation and transportation or blind allocation and transportation resulted in phenomena such as "sweatshirts arrive in autumn" and "flannel clothes arrive in winter" and shortage of goods in areas that need them and backlog in areas that do not need them. These must be gradually improved in this year's grain purchase work. In order to guarantee the completion of the national grain purchase plan this year, state-owned commercial departments and cooperatives in various places must make grain-producing areas and cotton-producing areas the focus of supply. In terms of material preparation, the materials needed by farmers in these areas must be transferred first, and attention must be paid to the sales situation in these areas at any time, and the material reserves of state-owned stores and cooperatives in these areas must be continuously replenished in order to meet the needs of farmers at any time. In addition to the general daily necessities such as fertilizers, wrought iron for making farm tools, small farm tools, oil, salt, and cloth, the supply of grain should be especially noted in cotton-producing areas so that cotton farmers can buy a certain amount of grain after selling cotton.

While going to the countryside to purchase grain and cotton, it is necessary to ensure that where grain is purchased, material supply also reaches there, and the goods suitable for farmers' needs are delivered to farmers as soon as possible. It is necessary to promote the method of bringing goods to the countryside and selling goods to buy grain. In selling goods to buy grain, procedures should be simplified as much as possible to facilitate farmers. This year, many areas adopted the method of bringing goods to the countryside and buying grain on the spot during the purchase of wheat, which was warmly welcomed by farmers. It not only completed the grain purchase task, but also established extensive purchase and sale relationships with farmers, opening up a broad market for industrial products to go to the countryside. This experience should be promoted.

State-owned commerce must fully cooperate with cooperatives. Cooperatives have a vast business network and mass base, and are a powerful assistant to state-owned commerce. Giving support to cooperatives and correctly playing the role of cooperatives will help to quickly send a large number of industrial products to farmers, gradually introduce the purchasing and sales activities of the vast number of farmers into the overall national economic plan, and further develop urban and rural trade. Leadership should also be strengthened for private commerce that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and they should be promoted to better serve the urban and rural economy under the leadership of state-owned commerce and the implementation of market management. As for illegal acts of speculation and disruption of the market, they should be strictly banned.

The time for grain purchase is now at hand. All commercial workers must work with a hundredfold effort to do a good job in grain purchase and ensure the completion of the state's plan.

### 作好购粮中的物资供应工作

    作好购粮中的物资供应工作
    秋粮和主要经济作物的收购工作已经开始了，这是目前国家经济生活中的一项极为重要的工作。购粮工作的好坏，直接影响着国家物资后备力量的储存、城市人民食用的需要、农民生活的改善、国内市场的扩大，以及工农联盟的巩固等一系列的重大问题。因此，秋粮收购工作必须作好。
    要作好购粮工作，必须有正确的价格政策以及必要的经济工作和政治工作。今年国家规定的新的棉粮比价、新的粮食收购价格和“优级优价”、“好次兼收”的办法，以及其他相应的措施，是完全符合农民的利益的。只要在正确的价格政策的基础上，作好必要的经济工作和政治工作，特别是物资供应工作，我们就一定能把购粮工作做好。在小农经济占优势的我国，农民与城市进行经济联系的主要形式，是通过商品交换的买卖关系。农民卖出粮食是为了买进所需要的商品，如果我们不能满足农民对商品的需要，农民出售余粮的兴趣就会减少，出售余粮的行动就要延迟。特别由于土地改革后，连年丰收，大多数农民的生活有了改善，他们对商品的需要增多，这就更增加了作好物资供应工作去吸引农民卖出余粮的重要性。
    但是，并不是所有的粮食工作和商业工作的人员都充分了解了购粮工作中作好物资供应的重要性。有很多干部还只是把购粮工作当作简单的行政任务，当作只是向农民要粮食的工作。他们不了解收购农民的余粮和供给农民生产资料与生活资料，乃是国家商业工作和合作社工作的一个重要部分，是联系城乡经济的重要措施。一方面，它是为农业生产服务，帮助农民尽快地卖出余粮，用这些收入来扩大生产和改善农民生活。因此就应该在可能条件下充分满足农民在这方面的需要。过去，很多地方由于物资供应不良，使得有些农民拿到了钱买不到他们所需要的商品。这是一个极其深刻的教训。我们必须在今年购粮中作到既要适时地收购农民的粮食，又要充分地供应农民所需要的商品。另一方面，它又要为城市工业生产服务，大力推销城市工业产品，扩大工业品的市场。毛主席教导我们说：
    “农民—这是中国工业市场的主体。只有他们能够供给最丰富的粮食和原料，并吸收最大量的工业品。”（“论联合政府”）我国工业的发展，主要依靠于国内市场，首先是广大的农村市场。国家工业不把自己的产品卖给农村市场，就不能从农村市场取得粮食和原料的供应；而没有粮食和原料的供应，工业就无法存在和发展。过去，很多购粮工作人员对这项工作的意义认识不足，或者没有积极开辟货源，或者对工业品的供应工作不适当，也妨害了购粮和物资供应工作。因此，今后必须首先认识购粮工作的重要意义，才能作好购粮和物资供应工作，保证购粮任务的完成，进一步巩固工农联盟。
    为了作好物资供应工作，必须采取很多具体措施。首先要求各地国营商业部门和合作社，在当地财经委员会统一领导下，切实根据产粮区农民具体需要的商品品种、规格、质量，正确地估计农民的购买力，实事求是地订出供应计划。并据此继续开辟货源，扩大收购工业品。在开辟货源方面，我们不仅要注意到大城市大工业产品的采购，同时，也应该十分注意对适合当地人民需要的地方工业产品的采购和推销，并积极帮助这些企业提高产品质量、降低成本，使它们能生产出更多价廉物美的商品，以供应市场的需要。由于手工业产品在农村中的销售量很大，占农民购买的工业品的总量百分之六十到八十，各地合作社，应根据需要和可能，加强与当地手工业生产的结合，通过订立供销合同，供应手工业生产所需的原料，积极推销其产品。在物资供应工作中，要特别注意加强秋季肥料供应，加强农民秋收、秋种所需要的农具的供应。
    保证做好秋季物资供应的另一个重要环节，就是作好物资调运。我国地区广大、交通不便，加上农村的分散环境，如不作好调运，就不能保证物资的适时供应。过去，由于调运工作不当或者盲目调运，曾经产生“秋来汗衫到”“冬去绒衣来”和要货的地区缺货、不要货的地区积压的现象，这些都必须在今年的购粮工作中逐步加以改进。为保证今年国家收购粮食计划的完成，各地国营商业部门和合作社必须把产粮区、产棉区作为供应的重点。在物资准备上，必须把适合这些地区农民需要的物资首先调运，并随时注意这些地区的销售情况，不断地充实这些地区国营商店和合作社的物资储备，以便随时满足农民的需要。供应产粮区和产棉区农民的物资，除一般的应注意供应肥料、造农具的熟铁、小型农具及油、盐、布匹等日用必需品外，在产棉区应特别注意粮食的供应，使棉农出卖了棉花，能够买进一定数量的粮食。
    在下乡收购粮、棉的同时，要做到收购粮食到那里，物资供应也到那里，把适合农民需要的货物尽快地送到农民手里。要提倡带货下乡、卖货买粮的办法。在卖货买粮中，应尽量简化手续，便利农民。今年收购小麦中，不少地区由于采取了带货下乡，就地买粮的办法，受到农民的热烈欢迎，不但完成了购粮任务，并且和农民建立了广泛的购销关系，为工业品下乡开辟了广阔的市场。这个经验应该推广。
    国营商业必须和合作社充分地合作。合作社有广大的营业网和群众基础，是国营商业的有力助手。给合作社以支持并正确地发挥合作社的作用，将有利于把大批工业品迅速地送到农民手里，把广大农民的购销活动逐渐导入国家总的经济计划之中，并进一步发展城乡的贸易工作。对有利于国计民生的私营商业，也应加强领导，促使它们在国营商业领导与实行市场管理的条件下更好地为城乡经济服务，至于投机倒把、扰乱市场的不法行为，应予以严格取缔。
    目前购粮的时机已到，全体商业工作者必须百倍紧张地作好购粮工作，保证完成国家的计划。
