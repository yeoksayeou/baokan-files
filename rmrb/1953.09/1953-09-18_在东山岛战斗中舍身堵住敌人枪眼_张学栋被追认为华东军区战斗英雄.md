In the Dongshan Island Battle, Sacrificing Himself to Block Enemy Gunfire
Zhang Xuedong Posthumously Recognized as a Combat Hero of the East China Military Region

The leading organs of the East China Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army recently issued an order posthumously recognizing Zhang Xuedong, a squad leader in the style of Huang Jiguang, as a combat hero of the East China Military Region, for using his body to block an enemy gun emplacement during the Battle of Dongshan Island, and thus gloriously sacrificing his life. The 5th Squad of the 2nd Platoon of the 2nd Company of a certain unit to which Zhang Xuedong belonged during his lifetime was renamed the "Zhang Xuedong Squad."

On July 16th of this year, the remnants of the Chiang bandits invaded Dongshan Island off the coast of Fujian, and were routed in disarray under the powerful blows of our army and civilians. The 2nd Platoon of the 2nd Company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army was ordered to cooperate with fraternal units to annihilate two companies of remnant bandits on Highland 214. These bandits retreated there, attempting to escape to the sea. The enemy, occupying the high ground, desperately resisted. During the battle, the platoon leader and deputy platoon leader were unfortunately killed and wounded. In this emergency, Zhang Xuedong, squad leader of the 5th Squad of the 2nd Platoon, and a member of the Communist Party of China, stepped forward and led the other soldiers to continue attacking the remnant enemy. Zhang Xuedong, carrying a light machine gun, fired at the enemy while rushing towards the enemy's bunker, driving back the enemy's counterattack. As Zhang Xuedong advanced, he sustained serious injuries to his chest and thigh, and was on the verge of collapsing. But Zhang Xuedong mustered the last of his strength and rushed all the way to the front of the bunker. When Zhang Xuedong was about to open fire to eliminate the enemy in the bunker, he discovered that the machine gun had run out of bullets. At this time, the enemy's heavy machine gun was firing fiercely, making it difficult for everyone to rush forward. Suddenly, comrades saw Zhang Xuedong stand up abruptly and lunge directly towards the enemy's bunker, using his body to block the enemy's gun port. In the instant when the enemy stopped firing, the soldiers of the 2nd Platoon rushed up and seized the enemy's bunker, and then, together with fraternal units, completely annihilated the remnant enemy, completing the predetermined task.

Zhang Xuedong gloriously sacrificed his life for the whole, for victory. His brilliant image of loving the motherland and loving the people will forever live in the hearts of the people of the motherland. (Xinhua News Agency)

    在东山岛战斗中舍身堵住敌人枪眼
    张学栋被追认为华东军区战斗英雄
    中国人民解放军华东军区领导机关最近发布命令，追认在东山岛战斗中用自己的身体堵住敌人枪眼，因而光荣牺牲的黄继光式的班长张学栋为华东军区战斗英雄，并授名张学栋生前所在的某部第二连第二排第五班为“张学栋班”。
    今年七月十六日，残余蒋匪窜犯福建沿海的东山岛，在我军民的强大打击下狼狈溃退。人民解放军某部二连二排奉命配合兄弟部队歼灭二一四高地上两个连的残余匪军。这批匪军退缩到那里企图夺路向海上逃命。敌人居高临下，拼命顽抗。战斗中，排长和副排长不幸伤亡。在情况紧急时，二排五班班长、中国共产党党员张学栋挺身而出，带领其他战士继续向残余敌人攻击。张学栋端起轻机枪一面向敌人扫射，一面向敌人的地堡扑去，把向我反击的敌人打了回去。张学栋向前攻击时，胸部和大腿负了重伤，眼看就要倒下了。但是张学栋鼓足了全身最后的力量，一直冲到地堡跟前。当张学栋准备开枪消灭地堡里敌人的时候，发现机枪里的子弹已经打光了。这时敌人地堡里的重机枪打得很猛烈，大家一时不容易冲上去。同志们突然看见张学栋猛地站立起来，直扑到敌人地堡跟前，用自己的肉体堵塞了敌人的枪眼。在敌人停止射击的一霎间，二排战士冲上去夺下了敌人的地堡，然后又和兄弟部队一道全部歼灭了残余敌人，完成了预定的任务。
    张学栋为了整体、为了胜利而光荣殉国了。他热爱祖国、热爱人民的光辉形象将永远活在祖国人民的心里。（新华社）
