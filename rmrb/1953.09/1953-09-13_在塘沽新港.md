    At Tanggu New Port
    By our reporter Lin Li
    The Motherland's Gateway
    This is Bohai Bay. It's the closest stretch of coastline to the interior. It lies to the left of Dagu Port.
    Before, there was nothing here—no trees, no people. The fierce sea drove away even the wildflowers and grass.
    Before, this was a barren alkaline flat. People called it a "wasteland."
    Here, there are two tides every day. When the tide rises, the water, one or two people deep, rolls and surges. When the tide falls, miles of silt separate the ocean from the land. Not only could pedestrians not walk here, but even wild animals couldn't come. In the past years, the tide has washed over this piece of our motherland twice a day, year after year, day after day.
    But now—
    People have conquered nature, controlled the sea, and overcome the silt. On this desolate beach, a large-scale seaport has emerged—Tanggu New Port. With the birth of this new-type seaport, everything here has changed. It has changed so much that the elderly can't recognize the place, and children can't understand the past desolation.
    The people who built Tanggu New Port always affectionately call it "the capital's gateway" or "the motherland's door." Because it is only a hundred and sixty kilometers away from Beijing, it is the closest point of the ocean to the capital. Foreign friends coming to our capital from the sea first land here. Goods imported from abroad to northern China are unloaded here. Many of our country's exports are also loaded onto ships here. Tanggu New Port has great economic value and significance. More importantly: this port was built with our own people's manpower and resources, and the key to this gate is in our own hands. In China's history of the past century, the customs have always been controlled by imperialists. Along the long coastline, there was not a single port built by ourselves. Dagu Port has had its own particularly unfortunate experience. As early as 1900, the first shell fired by the "Eight-Nation Alliance" when attacking Beijing landed here. The "Boxer Protocol" signed after this war also included the "leveling" of the Dagu forts and the permission for foreign troops to be stationed in Tanggu as an important part. From that time on, China lost the right to build national defense at Dagu Port. Dagu Port became a colony at the mercy of others, and of course, it was impossible to build its own commercial port. Because Dagu Port did not have its own defense forces, in July 1937, the invading forces of Japanese fascism landed here effortlessly. Japanese fascists were very clear about the importance of Dagu Port. When it had not yet firmly established itself in North China, it began the construction of Tanggu New Port. They planned to export 27 million tons of plundered materials from here every year to support its aggression against China. However, the wild ambition of Japanese fascists was not realized. It only completed the construction of berths for 3,000-ton ships, which was very small in scale. After the surrender of Japanese imperialism, the Kuomintang bandit gang did not carry out the necessary maintenance and upkeep of the existing projects, and the navigation channel was silted up into a shallow water beach, and the front of the pier became almost a flat ground. The Kuomintang reactionaries even brought American soldiers here. They arrogantly threatened some Chinese people who came here for a walk: "This is not your territory." In this way, Dagu Port suffered nearly half a century of insult and trampling. It was not until the beginning of 1949 that Dagu Port returned to the hands of the Chinese people. From then on, we began to build our coastal defense and also built a commercial port that can berth several 10,000-ton ships at the same time. In port construction, Tanggu New Port is the firstborn child since the founding of our People's Republic of China. Like the great Huai River harnessing project, the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway project, and the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway project, it is one of our great contemporary construction projects.
    The water area of Tanggu New Port is very large, and no artificial port in the world can compare with it. In just one year last year, the silt dug out of the channel was equivalent to the earthwork project of digging a canal from Tianjin to Beijing. The length of the breakwater is also unmatched by other ports in our country. The railway track close to the seaside can be connected with the seven main railway lines in our country. Leaving the new port lock and heading west along the Hai River to Tianjin, it can also communicate with the five inland rivers on the Hebei Plain. There is also a corresponding ship repair and shipbuilding factory here, which is responsible for repairing ships. With the emergence of these huge buildings, thousands of houses and warehouses have also appeared here, which are used to welcome import and export materials and for the accommodation of port management personnel.
    However, the entire project of Tanggu New Port has not ended. Only the first phase of the project has been completed. In the future, we will continue to move forward while using it and building it.
      Dockside Vignettes
    The day I arrived at Tanggu New Port, three large ships were berthed at Pier No. 1. One came from a New Democratic country, and two came from capitalist countries. Around the three large ships were tugboats, barges, crane ships, and sampans. The loading and unloading machines on the shore were running back and forth, the locomotive whistles were responding to each other, and the stevedores were busy. The two automatic coal loaders on Pier No. 2 had just sent away a 10,000-ton coal ship and were waiting for the next one.
    Comrade Zhou Shengmin, who is in charge of the dock work, accompanied me to visit the various warehouses and open-air cargo yards. At the east end of the sixth warehouse, a universal loading and unloading machine was moving huge machines and boxed components out of the warehouse one by one and loading them onto trains for transportation. Fertilizer, which had just been unloaded from ships, was piled from the ground all the way to the top of the warehouse, and was being extended from the west end of the warehouse to the east. Comrade Zhou Shengmin introduced: "These machines and fertilizers were all shipped from our brother country Poland." He particularly emphasized the words "brother," and then said with deep feeling: "This is true brotherly friendship. The goods from the Soviet Union and New Democratic countries have no luxury goods, always cars! Tractors! And then steel equipment, fertilizer, and scientific instruments. All of them are urgently needed for our current industrial and agricultural production." Zhou Shengmin's understanding of international friendship is profound. He works on the seaside but directly serves the people of the interior. He knows the needs of the people in the interior and works quite conscientiously. He said that the farmers in Shandong Province are looking forward to fertilizer. A few days ago, they sent a telegram to the cooperative headquarters, saying: "Send the fertilizer quickly! It will be too late!" But the people in the interior did not know that while they were sending the telegram, ships from the brother country Poland were unloading here. In order not to miss the farming season and deliver the fertilizer to the farmers on time, Zhou Shengmin and his partners also launched a quick loading and unloading campaign among the stevedores. The workers have broken through the planned quota of unloading a thousand tons of cargo per shift. Despite this, Zhou Shengmin's mood is still quite tense. He is deeply afraid of delaying the needs of the farmers. He is muttering to himself: "Delaying the needs of the farmers is certainly the responsibility of the cooperative. However, the loss to the farmers can never be made up." So he turned around and said to me: "The fertilizer will be put on the train tomorrow, and it can be delivered to Shandong the day after tomorrow." He said, smiling.
    In the open-air cargo yard, cars and tractors were lined up one after another, forming large vertical and horizontal teams. The warehouse keepers covered the bodies of the tractors with straw mats. Then they gently wrote the word "Gottwald." It turned out that these cars and tractors were shipped from Czechoslovakia and were sent by the "Gottwald" ship, named after the glorious Comrade Gottwald. People wrote the word "Gottwald" to express the deep gratitude of the Chinese people for the friendly assistance of brother countries.
    We detoured behind the warehouse and saw towering wooden frames crisscrossing in the distance, and a large number of construction workers were climbing up and down. Next to that huge building, a road roller was flattening a wide square. Comrade Zhou Shengmin said: "The two larger warehouses under construction in the distance. Because the rapid development of international trade has greatly exceeded our expectations. Therefore, the originally built warehouses are not enough. In order to free up space for the newly arrived goods, we have spent a lot of effort. The Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council also stipulated 'Ten Measures' for us, one of which is that goods must be picked up within ten days. Even so, the existing warehouses are still not enough. That's why we decided to build two larger warehouses." Speaking of the nearby square, Zhou Shengmin was even more excited. He said: "That is also an open-air cargo yard, 7,000 square meters large. It is also much better than the original open-air cargo yard. A thick layer of gravel has been laid on this open-air cargo yard, and it will be rolled as solid and flat as an asphalt road. Because the goods that come now are always machines, the mud cargo yard cannot support them." His simple and unadorned sketch just illustrates the prosperity of this new-type seaport and its role and significance in the planned economic construction of the motherland.
      On the Dredger
    People who live on the mainland are very lucky to have the opportunity to come to Tanggu New Port and see it. Here, like other seashores, the scenery is beautiful and the air is fresh. Standing on that steel and concrete dock, looking into the distance, the clear blue sea and the light blue sky are connected together, and you can't tell whether the sky is connected to the sea or the sea is connected to the sky. Looking closer, the waves are churning on the sea surface, and the people who are building the port are driving all kinds of ships. They are resourceful and brave, fighting the ocean and waging a decisive battle against the silt.
    I came to a "suction and discharge" dredger. This kind of ship has a heavy "cutter" on its head and a long "tail" behind its butt—this is the mud discharge pipe. The mud discharge pipe is like a huge long snake, stretching from the ocean to the land in a winding manner. When the cutter on the bow plunges into the seabed, a large amount of silt is quickly sprayed onto the land. Suction dredgers are very efficient, especially suitable for port areas with shallow water and lots of mud. In the construction of the Tanggu New Port project, suction dredgers undertook more than 60% of the dredging tasks. On the ship, Comrade Zhang Qingyuan, the captain of the "Tanggu" dredging team, introduced to me the changes and progress of the dredger. Zhang Qingyuan used to be a sailor. After liberation, he was promoted to the captain of the Tanggu No. 4 dredger. Recently, he was promoted to the dredging captain leading eight large ships. He said that the captains and drivers of each ship were all cultivated and promoted from the workers during the port construction. He found Captain Mu Chengyi, car driver Shi Jingui, and some ordinary crew members. Everyone chimed in when he talked about the promotion of cadres. This one said: "Yes! We all grew up in the port construction." That one said: "In the past, there was no such talent in our place, and all dredging technology was in the hands of the Japanese." The third one said: "At that time, who dared to touch other people's machines? Unless you didn't want your head." The fourth one said: "At that time, they trampled on us, saying that the Chinese couldn't operate the machines. Now let those imperialist elements take a look!" ……The people on the ship spoke extremely angrily about the past, and they were so happy about the present. These words, which have been heard thousands of times on land, are so fresh at sea. For a person from the land, it seems that the crew members can't fully express their emotions unless they start from here.
    Then, they talked about their feelings when they first started driving the ships, how Soviet experts helped them overcome difficulties, how they went from understanding nothing to being proficient, and how they broke through the old indicators and created a new dredging record. The people on the ship spoke in high, loud voices, and were humorous. It was as if they were afraid that the waves would cover their voices. At this time, I remembered the story told by Comrade Jin Bu, the deputy captain of the New Port Engineering Team.
    When Comrade Jin Bu first came to Tanggu New Port, he was still a student who had just left school. Now he is responsible for the party and government work and the arduous dredging tasks of the entire port construction engineering team. He said: "The construction process of Tanggu New Port is actually a dredging process. Whether or not we can overcome the silt is the key to determining whether Tanggu New Port can exist. But at the beginning, we had no experience and made a lot of jokes." Among the many stories that now seem like "jokes" that he told, there is a passage like this:
    "That was when we were just entering the climax of port construction, and Comrade Shashkov, a Soviet expert, came. He asked us how much mud concentration we had? - This question stumped the engineering technicians. You look at me, I look at you, and no one can answer. To be honest, at that time we didn't even know what the use of mastering the concentration was! Comrade Shashkov saw that we were embarrassed and said: 'Okay, let's go and take a look together.' We followed the expert, thinking that since we were looking at the concentration, we must go on the ship. However, the expert didn't go to the seaside, but kept walking along the mud discharge pipe. When Comrade Shashkov arrived at the mud discharge place, he reached out and grabbed a handful, looked at it, and said: 'No! The concentration is not enough.'
  "How much is enough?" we asked, staring.
    "'In the Soviet Union, it is 30%,' the expert replied: '—that is to say: of what comes out of the mud discharge pipe, mud accounts for 30% and water accounts for 70%.'
   "Comrade Shashkov seemed to be a stern person, and everyone secretly guessed: 'He must be an authoritative expert.' (Later, we learned that he had many works on dredging engineering.) However, Comrade Shashkov was so patient and always showed the spirit of being tireless in teaching us. He smiled and used an analogy: 'Mud discharge is like cooking porridge. Thick porridge, one scoop of rice; thin porridge, one scoop of nothing - the water all runs out of the gaps in your fingers. You are now cooking thin porridge, which is a waste of the country's manpower and financial resources.'
    "Comrade Shashkov then asked: 'How much mud do you dig per hour?' We replied: '300 cubic meters.' - The Soviet expert shook his head and said nothing. In fact, is it really 300 cubic meters? Or even a little more? We didn't know at all. We just based it on what the Japanese used to say about the effectiveness of this kind of ship.
    "At this time, Comrade Shashkov introduced us to the Soviet dredging experience, specifically explaining how to increase the mud discharge concentration and how to increase the machine turnover rate. However, this does not mean that there were no problems. How to turn the expert's instructions into reality? And how to cook thin porridge into thick porridge?
   "Most of our engineering technicians are young people. They are very enthusiastic about national construction, but almost none of them studied port construction. In the past, Chinese ports were controlled by imperialists. Old China did not leave us with port construction talents, nor did it have a role model to learn from. What should we do? The Party often teaches us to rely on the working class and discuss things with the masses.
   "So we worked with the workers to find the accurate figures for the amount of mud dug and to find the reasons for the insufficient mud discharge concentration. Once we looked, the problems came out! One of the biggest problems was the low mechanical operating efficiency. Within 24 hours a day, there were only 15 hours of dredging. Secondly, within these 15 hours, what was discharged was more water and less mud, with a concentration of only 15%. At the same time, it was found that there was a series of unreasonable phenomena from machine operation to management system. In fact, we didn't even have an operating procedure before!
   "We relied on the workers to find the problems, and then we handed the problems over to the workers to solve. The trade union led everyone to find tricks and put forward rationalization proposals. The administration also specifically marked the topics of 'topic awards'. As a result, many advanced working methods emerged, and the problems that were previously considered unsolvable were solved. The mud discharge concentration quickly rose from 15% to 30%. The dredging time gradually increased from 15 hours in the past to an average of 20 hours. Due to the increase in mud discharge concentration and the increase in machine turnover rate, the old quota of digging 300 cubic meters of mud per hour was gradually raised to a new record of 700 cubic meters per hour. This means that the work of one ship is almost equivalent to the performance of two and a half ships in the past. At the same time, we established a 'concentration test' system to test the mud discharge concentration every five minutes, a 'flow rate check' system to check the machine turnover rate, and other operational systems."
    The process of the evolution of the dredging work that Comrade Jin Bu said is actually the construction process of Tanggu New Port, and it is also the process of progress of every person who built Tanggu New Port. When Comrade Zhang Qingyuan, the captain of the "Tanggu" dredging team, was promoted to the captain of the Tanggu No. 4 dredger, he was so nervous. He was happy, but also anxious. He was happy that he became a captain, but he asked himself anxiously: "Can I do it? An old roughneck who sells labor and works as a sailor? Leading a ship is not that simple?" But then he thought: "If I don't do it, who will? The leaders say all day long that New China needs to rely on us to build it. Can we be afraid of difficulties?" Zhang Qingyuan's partners also encouraged him, saying: "Old Zhang, do it! With all of us, you won't have any difficulties." When Zhang Qingyuan became the captain, he caught up with the engineering bureau calling for increasing the mud discharge concentration and increasing the machine turnover rate. Zhang Qingyuan and everyone checked their ship and calculated all the dredging time. After looking at it, there were only 15 hours of dredging time per day. He was shocked!
  "Where did the time go?" he calculated. He arranged all the downtime in front of him. Except for all the inevitable time, he found that the most time was taken up by moving the anchor to stop and cleaning the cable to stop. Normally, each move would take seventy minutes. From the fact that everyone looked forward to the ship breaking down during the Japanese rule before liberation, and the fact that the workers tried to lengthen the anchor moving time during the Kuomintang reactionary rule, he concluded: "The anchor moving time can be shortened or reduced." He handed his idea to the technical staff for research and asked the workers to discuss it. At the same time, he did three or five actual tests. A method of "not stopping when moving the anchor" was established. But at this time, there was still a waste of four minutes of "blowing water" time. Zhang Qingyuan's method quickly spread to various ships. The Tanggu No. 5 ship was also testing it. When they heard that Zhang Qingyuan's experiment was successful, their confidence was even stronger. The next day, they even reduced the four minutes of "blowing water" time. "Not stopping when moving the anchor" has become a complete method. People calculated for him that saving just these seventy minutes could dig an additional 127,000 cubic meters of mud per year.
    The huge Tanggu New Port project was built by relying on the gradual exploration of these comrades, and it was condensed by the painstaking efforts of these comrades. (To be continued)

    在塘沽新港
    本报记者　林里
    祖国的门户
    这里是渤海湾。是离内地最近的一段海岸。它在大沽口的左边。
    这里早先什么都没有——没有树木，没有人烟，凶恶的海水，把野花、小草都驱逐得远远的。
    这里早先是光秃秃的一片碱滩。人们叫它“不毛之地”。
    这里每天有两次海潮。潮水一涨，一、两人深的大水滚滚翻腾；潮水一落，十几里地的淤泥隔开了海洋和陆地，别说行人不能走，就是野兽都不能来。以往的若干年间，海潮就这样年复一年地、日复一日地、一天两次冲刷着这块祖国的土地。
    可是现在——
    人们征服了自然，控制了海水，战胜了淤泥，这荒僻的海滩上，出现了一个规模宏大的海港——塘沽新港。随着这个新型海港的诞生，这里的一切都变了。它变得使老年人不能认识这个地方，孩子们无法理解过去的荒凉。
    建设塘沽新港的人们，总是那么亲昵地把塘沽新港叫做“首都的门户”，或者唤做“祖国的大门”。因为这里相距北京只有一百六十多公里，是海洋离京城最近的地方。从海上到我国首都来的外国朋友，首先在这里登陆。由国外输入我国北方的货物，要在这里靠岸。我国向外输出的物资，很多也在这里上船。塘沽新港在经济上的价值和意义是很大的。然而更重要的是：这个港口是用我们本国的人力物力修成的，进出这个大门的钥匙，掌握在我们自己的手里。我国近百年来的历史上，海关一直操纵在帝国主义手里。漫长的海岸线上，找不到一个港口是我们自己修筑的。大沽口这个地方，更有它特殊不幸的遭遇。远在一九○○年，“八国联军”打北京时的第一颗炮弹就落在这里。由这次战争所订定的“辛丑条约”，还把“削平”大沽炮台，允许外国军队驻扎塘沽，做为重要内容之一。从那时起，我国便失去了在大沽口建设国防的权利。大沽口事实上成了任人宰割的殖民地，当然也不可能建设自己的商港了。因为大沽口没有了自己的防御力量，所以一九三七年七月，日本法西斯的侵略武装，便不费吹灰之力从这里登陆了。日本法西斯很清楚大沽口这个地方的重要，当它在华北立脚未稳的时候，便开始了塘沽新港的建筑工程。他们预备每年从这里输出二千七百万吨掠夺的物资，以支持它对中国的侵略。但是，日本法西斯的狂妄野心并没有实现，它仅只完成了停泊三千吨级轮船的建设，规模是很小的。日本帝国主义投降以后，国民党匪帮对于已有工程没有进行必要的维护和保养，航道淤成了浅水滩，码头前面几乎成了平地。国民党反动派更把美国兵带到了这里。他们对一些随便来此走走的中国人，都蛮横地恐吓着：“这里不是你们的领土。”就这样：大沽口这地方蒙受了将近半个世纪的侮辱和蹂躏。直到一九四九年初，大沽口才回到了中国人民自己的手里。从此，我们开始建设我们的海防，也建成了可以同时停泊数艘万吨轮船的商港。在港湾建设当中，塘沽新港又是我们中华人民共和国成立以来的头生子。它和伟大的根治淮河工程、成渝铁路工程、天兰铁路工程一样，是我们当代伟大建筑工程之一。
    塘沽新港的水区面积很大，世界上还没有一个人工港可以和它相比。只去年一年，从航道里挖出来的淤泥，就相当于开凿一条从天津到北京的运河的土方工程。防波堤的长度，也是我国其他港口所不能相比的。紧靠海边的那根铁轨，可以和我国七条主要铁路干线相联。出新港船闸，溯海河西行，到天津，又可以和河北平原上的五条内河沟通。这里还有一个相应的船舶修造厂，担负着修理船舶的任务。随着这些巨大建筑物的产生，这里还出现了几千幢房屋和仓库，是为了迎送进出口物资及港务管理人员住宿用的。
    然而，塘沽新港的整个工程并没有结束。现在仅只完成了第一期工程。今后将在一边使用，一边建设中继续前进。
      码头小景
    我到塘沽新港的那天，一号码头上停泊着三只大船。一只来自新民主主义国家，两只来自资本主义国家。三只大船的旁边，围绕着拖轮、驳船、起重船，还有舢舨。岸上的装卸机来回奔跑，火车的汽笛应声呼叫，搬运工人在忙碌着。二号码头上的两部自动装煤机，刚刚送走了万吨煤船，在迎候着下一船只。
    负责码头工作的周省民同志，陪我参观了各个仓库和露天货场。在第六仓库的东头，万能装卸机把巨大的机器和成箱的机件，一部一部地推出仓外，装上火车运走了。刚刚下船的肥田粉，从地面一直堆到了仓顶，正由这座仓库的西头向东延伸着。周省民同志介绍说：“这些机器、肥田粉，都是从我们兄弟国家波兰运来的。”他特别把“兄弟”二字的声音加重，然后又深有所感地说着：“这才是真正的兄弟友谊。从苏联、新民主主义国家来的货物，没有一件奢侈品，总是汽车呀！拖拉机呀！再就是钢铁器材，肥田粉、科学仪器。都是我们眼前工业生产和农业生产上所急用的。”周省民对于国际友谊的体会是深刻的。他工作在海滨，却直接服务于内地的人民。他知道内地人民的需要，工作相当认真。他说山东省的农民，正在盼望着肥田粉，前两天，还给合作总社打电报，说：“赶快送肥田粉来吧！再晚了就赶不上用啦！”可是内地人民不知道，正当他们打电报的时候，兄弟国家波兰的船只却在这里卸货了。为了不误农时，准时地把肥田粉送给农民，周省民和他的伙伴们，还在装卸工人中发动了快装快卸运动。工人们已突破了每班卸装千吨货的计划定额。尽管如此，周省民的心情还是相当紧张的。他深怕耽误了农民的需要，他在自言自语地说着：“耽误了农民的需要，固然是合作社的责任。可是，农民的损失那就再也无法弥补了。”于是他转回头，面对着我说：“明天就叫肥田粉上火车，后天就可以送到山东了。”他说着，笑了。
    露天货场上的汽车、拖拉机，一辆挨着一辆，排成了纵横相错的大队。保管工人用席子盖住了拖拉机的机身。然后轻轻地写上了“哥特”二字。原来这些汽车、拖拉机，是由捷克斯洛伐克运来，并且是用光荣的哥特瓦尔德同志的名字命名的“哥特瓦尔德号”轮船送来的。人们写上“哥特”二字，是表示我国人民对兄弟国家的友谊援助的深切感激。
    我们绕道仓库的后面，远远看见纵横交织着高大的木架，大批建筑工人在爬上爬下。紧靠那个巨大建筑的旁边，轧路机在碾平着一个宽阔的广场。周省民同志说：“远处正在建筑的，是两座更大的仓库。因为国际贸易的迅速发展，大大超过了我们的预计。于是，原来修盖的仓库不够用了。为了给新来的货物腾地盘，我们费了好大劲呵。政务院财经委员会还给我们规定了‘十大措施’，其中有一条是来货必须十天提取。就这样，原有仓库还是不够用。这才决定建筑两座更大的仓库。”说起旁边的广场，周省民更是兴致勃勃，他说：“那也是露天货场，有七千平方公尺大。也比原来的露天货场好得多。在这个露天货场上，已经铺了很厚的一层石子，要把它轧成像柏油马路一样结实，一样平整。因为现在来的货物，总是机器呀机器，泥土货场是支撑不住的。”他这简单而朴实的素描，正好说明这个新型海港的繁荣景象和它在祖国有计划的经济建设中的作用和意义。
      在挖泥船上
    生活在大陆上的人们，能够有机会到塘沽新港来看看，那真是幸福极了。这里，和其他海滨一样，景色美丽，空气新鲜。站在那座钢骨水泥制成的码头上，远看，蓝澄澄的海水和淡蓝色的天空联结在一起，你分不清是天连着海，还是海连着天；近看，浪花翻卷着海面，建筑港口的人们驾驶着各种各样的船。他们机智、勇敢，向海洋进行着搏斗，向淤泥进行着决战。
    我来到一种“吸扬式”的挖泥船上。这种船，头顶上顶着粗重的“绞刀”，屁股后边拖着长长的“尾巴”——这是排泥管。排泥管像一条莽壮的长蛇，从海洋弯弯曲曲的伸向陆地。船头上的绞刀往海底一扎，大量淤泥便神速地喷向陆地。吸扬式挖泥船的效率很高，尤其适用于水浅泥多的港区。在建设塘沽新港工程中，吸扬式挖泥船担负了百分之六十以上的挖泥任务。在船上，“塘沽号”挖泥队队长张庆元同志，给我介绍了挖泥船的变化和进步。张庆元从前是水手，解放后被提拔为塘沽四号挖泥船的船长。最近又提拔成领导八只大船的挖泥队长。他说各个船上的船长、驾驶，都是建港当中，从工人里边培养、提拔起来的。他找来船长穆成义，大车史金贵，以及一些普通船员。大家听他讲起提拔干部的问题，就都插上嘴来。这个说：“是啊！我们都是在建港中长大的。”那个说：“过去咱这地方没有这种人材，挖泥技术全都掌握在日本人手里。”第三个说：“那时候，谁敢摸摸人家的机器？除非你不想要脑袋了。”第四个说：“那时候他们糟踏咱，说中国人开不了机器，现在让那些帝国主义分子瞧瞧吧！” ……船上的人说到过去异常愤激，说到现在又是那样欢喜。这些在陆地上听过千百次的话语，到了海上却是那么新鲜。船员们对于一个来自陆地的人，似乎也非先从这里说起就不足以表达他们的情感。
    接着，他们说到开始驾驶船只的心情，说到苏联专家如何帮助他们克服困难，说到他们怎样由不懂到熟练，以及怎样突破旧日指标，又创造了挖泥新纪录。船上的人说话嗓高、声大，又富有风趣。像是深怕海浪盖住了他的声音。这时候，我想起新港工程队副队长靳步同志说过的故事。
    靳步同志初到塘沽新港的时候，还是一个刚出校门的学生，现在负责整个筑港工程队的党政工作和艰巨的挖泥任务。他说：“塘沽新港的建设过程实际上是挖泥过程。能不能战胜淤泥，是决定塘沽新港能否存在的关键。但开始我们没有经验，闹了不少笑话。”在他所说的，许多现在看来是“笑话”的故事中，有一段是这样的：
    “那是刚刚进入建港高潮的时候，苏联专家沙士柯夫同志来了。问我们排泥浓度多大？——这一问，工程技术人员都傻眼了。你看我，我看你，谁也回答不来。老实说，那时候我们还不知道掌握浓度有什么用哩！沙士柯夫同志看见我们窘不堪言，就说：‘好吧，我们一起去看看好了。’我们跟着专家走，以为既然看浓度，那一定要上船哟。可是，专家不往海边走，却一直沿着排泥管子走去。沙士柯夫同志到了排泥的地方。伸手抓了一把，张手一看，说：‘不行呵！浓度不够。’
  “‘多少才算够哩？’我们瞪着眼问。
    “‘在苏联是百分之三十’专家回答说：‘——就是说：从排泥管里出来的，泥占百分之三十，水占百分之七十。’
   “沙士柯夫同志看来是个严厉的人，大家暗地里揣猜说：‘一定是权威专家。’（以后知道他有许多关于挖泥工程的著作。） 可是，沙士柯夫同志对我们是那样循循善诱，处处表现诲人不倦的精神。他笑着，打着比方：‘排泥，和熬粥一样。稠粥，一捞一把米；稀粥，一捞什么都没有——水都从手缝里流跑了。你们现在熬的是稀粥，这就浪费了国家的人力和财力。’
    “沙士柯夫同志又问：‘每小时挖多少泥？’我们回答说：‘三百立方公尺。’——苏联专家摇了摇头，没有说什么，其实，是不是三百立方公尺？或者还要多一点？我们全不知道。只是根据过去听日本人说这种船的效能是这些。
    “这时，沙士柯夫同志给我们介绍了苏联的挖泥经验，具体说明如何提高排泥浓度，如何提高机器周转率。然而这并不是说没有了问题，如何把专家的指示变成现实？又如何把稀粥熬成稠粥呢？
   “我们的工程技术人员，绝大部分是青年，他们对国家建设的热情满高，但几乎没有一个是学港湾建筑的，中国的港口，过去都操纵在帝国主义手里。旧中国没有给我们留下筑港人材，也没有学习的榜样。怎么办呢？党经常教导我们的是：依靠工人阶级，有事和群众商量。
   “于是我们和工人一起，寻找挖泥数量的准确数字，寻找排泥浓度不够的原因。这一找，问题出来啦！最大的问题之一，是机械运转效率低，一天二十四小时内，只有十五个小时挖泥。其次，在这十五个小时以内，排出来的是水多泥少，浓度只有百分之十五。同时发现，从机器操作到管理制度，存在着一系列的不合理现象。实在说，以前我们就没有个操作规程哩！
   “我们依靠工人找到了问题，又把问题交给工人去解决。由工会领导大家找窍门，提合理化建议。行政上也具体标出‘课题悬赏’的题目。这一来，许多先进工作方法出现了，过去认为不能解决的问题解决了。挖泥浓度很快由百分之十五，上升到百分之三十。挖泥时间由过去的十五小时，逐渐提高到平均二十小时。由于挖泥浓度的提高，机械周转率提高，就使过去每小时挖泥三百立方公尺的陈旧定额，逐渐上升到每小时七百立方公尺的新纪录。这就是说：一只船的工作，差不多相当于过去两只半船的成绩。同时，我们建立了每五分钟试验挖泥浓度一次的‘浓度试验’制度，检查机器周转率的‘流速检查’制度，以及其他方面的操作制度。”
    靳步同志说的挖泥工作的演变过程，实际上是塘沽新港的建设过程，也是每一个建设塘沽新港的人们的进步过程。“塘沽”号挖泥队队长张庆元，当他被提拔为塘沽四号挖泥船船长的时候，心情是那样紧张。他高兴，但又着急。他高兴自己当了船长，但他着急地自问着：“干得了吗？一个卖苦力、当水手的老粗？领导一条船可不那样简单？”可是他又想：“咱不干叫谁干哩？领导上成天说新中国要依靠我们来建设，我们能怕困难吗？”张庆元的伙伴们也鼓励他说：“老张，干吧！有我们大伙，你作不了难。”张庆元当了船长，正赶上工程局号召提高排泥浓度，提高机器周转率。张庆元和大家检查了自己的船，把全部挖泥时间计算了一下，一看，每天只有十五小时的挖泥时间。他大吃一惊！
  “时间跑到哪里去了呢？”他计算着。把各种停车时间排列在眼前，除去一切必不可免的时间以外，他发现移锚停车和清缆停车占去的时间最多，平常每移动一次要占去七十分钟。他从解放前，日本统治时期大伙盼着船坏，国民党反动统治时期工人们尽量把移锚时间拉长的事实，得出结论说：“移锚时间是可以缩短，或者减免的。”他把他的想法交给技术人员研究，请工人同志们讨论，他自己同时做了三番五次地实际试验。一个“移锚不停车”的方法成立了。但这时候还有四分钟的“吹水”时间的浪费。张庆元的方法很快传到了各个船上。塘沽五号船本来也在试验，一听说张庆元试验成功了，他们的信心更强了，第二天，他们连四分钟的“吹水”时间也减去了。“移锚不停车”成了一个完整的方法。人们替他计算了一下，单这七十分钟的节省，一年就可以多挖十二万七千立方公尺的泥。
    巨大的塘沽新港工程，就是依靠这些同志的逐步摸索建成的，就是依靠这些同志的点点滴滴的心血凝成的。（未完）
