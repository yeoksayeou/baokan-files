We had completely repatriated all US POWs from August 5th to September 6th, including the twenty-five American airmen who had confessed to participating in germ warfare and were exempted from prosecution by the Korean People's Army authorities. This fully demonstrates our spirit of conscientiously implementing the armistice agreement and our truly humanitarian attitude towards POWs. The US side's approach is completely different. Up to now, the US side has forcibly detained a large number of our captured personnel who should be repatriated, seriously affecting the implementation of the armistice agreement and harming the inalienable rights of these POWs.

Of course, the US side, as usual, uses a pile of lies to cover up their shady dealings on the issue of POW repatriation. In the Military Armistice Commission and the POW Repatriation Commission, the US representatives repeatedly stated that all our captured personnel who insisted on repatriation would be repatriated without exception; US Secretary of the Army Stevens also said: "We (the US) will not keep any prisoners of war"; US Secretary of State Dulles also announced on September 2: "All captured personnel who are willing to be repatriated" "will all be repatriated"; but the conclusive facts completely prove that these are worthless lies. In the twenty-three days from August 14th to September 5th, the US side only sent back seven Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war on the 14th, who should have been repatriated long ago and were wounded by the US military on the way. They did not repatriate a single Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoner of war who should have been directly repatriated. During this period, we repeatedly demanded that the other party explain why the repatriation of Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war was interrupted, but the other party remained irresponsibly silent and refused to respond to our legitimate demands. It was not until September 6th, the last day when the POWs who should be directly repatriated should have been repatriated, that the US side, in order to cope with the pressure of public opinion and cover up its conspiracy to continue to detain a large number of our captured personnel, repatriated 138 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war. At the same time, they pretended to claim: that our captured personnel who insisted on repatriation had been completely repatriated.

But what contrasts with these ridiculous lies is the ruthless fact. According to the accurate information we have, at least 228 Korean People's Army prisoners of war who insisted on repatriation are still being detained in US POW camps, and a large number of Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who should be directly repatriated have also not obtained their due right to repatriation. Let us quote the material spoken by US Secretary of the Army Stevens to prove it. On August 13th, Stevens told American reporters that there were still 250 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who should have been directly repatriated and had not been repatriated. If we take this number, and subtract the 138 repatriated on September 6th, then at least 112 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war were forcibly detained.

This is a serious violation of the armistice agreement. The US side must give a responsible explanation.

What is particularly serious is that while forcibly detaining our captured personnel who should be directly repatriated, the US side is also intensifying terrorist activities among our captured personnel who are not directly repatriated, the purpose of which is to use the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and the Syngman Rhee group to further control our captured personnel, obstruct and undermine the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, so as to finally forcibly detain them.

It is precisely because of this that Chiang Kai-shek recently secretly ordered Chen Jianzhong, the special agent leader of the US POW camp, to demand that the United Nations Command and the Syngman Rhee group forcibly detain the POWs in the name of "release" as soon as possible, and demanded that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who were not directly repatriated be sent to Taiwan. The Chiang gang is so rampant as to order Chen Jianzhong to try to undermine the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and to persecute our staff sent to the POW camp under the supervision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission with violence. Then, at the end of August, the Chiang gang sent a so-called delegation led by special agent leader Fang Zhi to Jeju Island and Busan POW camps to strengthen its criminal activities. And what is the relationship between the US side and these Chiang gang special agent activities? Just look at the following revelations from our returned personnel and it will be clear. Once, a US colonel gathered more than 300 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who were not directly repatriated in the Busan POW camp on the square to speak, and a Chiang gang special agent acted as a translator. The US colonel said to the POWs: "Soon you will be handed over to the Neutral Nations forces, but the United Nations Command will still protect you and send people to be with you, without dismantling your organization; the Neutral Nations forces are equipped with light weapons, you can seize their weapons and run away." Under such open and unbridled connivance of the American master, his lackey, the Chiang gang special agent, became even more rampant; he summoned POWs to meetings, taught everyone how to undermine the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission after being handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, how to obstruct the explanation work of the Korean and Chinese sides, and provoked the POWs to say that if the representatives of the Korean and Chinese sides came, they would kill them if they had the opportunity, and the United Nations would be responsible for killing people. In order to ensure the realization of their criminal plan, the Chiang gang special agents also prepared to impersonate POWs. When Fang Zhi, the special agent leader of the Chiang gang, went to the Busan POW camp to conduct activities, he openly made two arrogant demands to the US POW camp commander to undermine the POW agreement; he demanded that the US military authorities interfere with and undermine the functions and work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission under the pretext of guaranteeing the so-called "safety" of the POWs; he also demanded that the Chiang gang special agent organization be allowed to be preserved after the POWs were handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. And the US Busan POW camp commander McGall has completely agreed to this arrogant demand of the Chiang gang special agent. At the same time, news from POW camps in South Korea also proves that with the support and assistance of the US side, the Syngman Rhee special agents in each POW camp have received unified orders to organize "special agent teams" to carry out deception propaganda and intimidation against the POWs.

Since the signing of the Korean armistice, the US side has continued to carry out various conspiracies to forcibly detain POWs and has tried every possible means to obstruct the POW repatriation work, which we cannot tolerate. Now the POWs who are not directly repatriated have begun to be handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and the US side must immediately stop all conspiracies to undermine the POW agreement, and take responsible and effective measures to expel all special agent elements of the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee gangs lurking in the POW camps, so that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission can smoothly exercise its functions and carry out its work, so that the representatives of the Korean and Chinese sides can fully and freely carry out their explanation work, so as to ensure that the entire POW issue is resolved fairly and reasonably. This will greatly facilitate the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

    战俘协议不容破坏
    金之光
    从八月五日到九月六日我方已经全部遣返了美方战俘，包括那些曾供认参加进行细菌战而为朝鲜人民军当局免予法办的二十五名美籍空军人员在内。这充分地表现了我方认真地实施停战协定的精神和对战俘的真正人道主义的态度。而美方的作法却完全不是这样，一直到现在，美方仍然强迫扣留了大批应该遣返的我方被俘人员，严重地影响着停战协定的实施和损害着这些战俘不容剥夺的权利。
    当然，美方在战俘遣返的问题上，照例是用大堆的谎言来掩盖他们干的见不得人的勾当的。在军事停战委员会上和战俘遣返委员会上，美方代表一再说将无例外地遣返一切坚持遣返的我方被俘人员；美国陆军部长斯蒂文斯也说过：“我们（美方）将不把任何一个战俘留起来”；美国国务卿杜勒斯也在九月二日宣布：“一切被俘人员，凡是愿意遣返的”，“将一律遣返”；但确凿的事实完全证明了这是一文不值的谎话。从八月十四日到九月五日的二十三天中，美方除了十四日仅仅送来早就应该遣返而在途中又被美军打伤的七名中国人民志愿军被俘人员外，一直就没有遣返一个应该直接遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员。这期间，我方曾经一再提出要求，要对方交代为什么中断中国人民志愿军战俘的遣返，而对方却一直作着不负责任的沉默，拒绝答复我方的正当要求。直到九月六日，即应该把直接遣返的战俘遣返完毕的最后一日，美方才为了应付舆论的压力和掩盖其仍然扣留着大批我方被俘人员的阴谋，遣返了一百三十八名中国人民志愿军被俘人员，同时装模作样地声称：坚持遣返的我方被俘人员，已经完全遣返完毕了。
    但与这些可笑的谎言对照的却是无情的事实。根据我方掌握的确切材料证明：朝鲜人民军被俘人员中坚持遣返的至少还有二百二十八名被扣留在美方战俘营内，至于应该直接遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员同样还有大批没有获得应有的遣返权利。让我们引用美国的陆军部长斯蒂文斯所讲的材料来证明吧，就在八月十三日那一天，斯蒂文斯对美国记者说，还有二百五十名应该直接遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员没有被遣返，我们就拿这个数字来看，除掉九月六日遣返回来的一百三十八名而外，至少还有一百一十二名中国人民志愿军被俘人员是被强迫扣留了。
    这是严重违反停战协定的行为。美方必须要作负责的交代。
    尤其严重的是，美方在强迫扣留应该直接遣返的我方被俘人员同时，还加紧在不直接遣返的我方被俘人员中进行恐怖活动，其目的就是利用蒋介石匪帮和李承晚集团进一步控制我方被俘人员，阻挠和破坏中立国遣返委员会的工作，以便最后强迫扣留他们。
    正是由于这样，最近蒋介石曾密令美方战俘营特务头子陈建中，要求联合国军和李承晚集团尽快以“释放”名义强迫扣留战俘，并要求把不直接遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员送到台湾去。蒋匪帮竟猖狂到命令陈建中设法破坏中立国遣返委员会的工作，以暴力迫害我方派去中立国遣返委员会看管下的战俘营的工作人员。接着蒋匪帮又在八月底派遣由特务头子方治率领的所谓代表团，去济州岛和釜山战俘营，加强其罪恶活动。而美方和这些蒋匪特务活动的关系怎样呢？只要看看归来的我方人员以下的揭露就清清楚楚了。一次，一个美军上校，把釜山战俘收容所中三百多名不直接遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员集合在广场上讲话，由一个蒋匪特务作翻译，这个美军上校对战俘们说：“不久你们就要交给中立国军队看管了，但联合国军仍将保护你们，并派人和你们一起去，不拆散你们的编制；中立国军队带的都是轻武器，你们可以夺取他们的武器跑出来。”在美国主子如此公开和放肆的纵容下，他的走狗蒋匪特务就更加猖獗起来；召集战俘开会，教大家在交给中立国遣返委员会看管以后，如何破坏中立国遣返委员会的工作，如何阻挠朝中方面的解释工作，并且挑唆战俘们说，如果朝中方面代表来了，有机会就打死他们，打死人由联合国负责。为了保证他们这套罪恶计划的实现，蒋匪特务还准备去冒名顶替战俘。蒋匪特务头子方治到釜山战俘营进行活动时，更公开向美方战俘营长官提出两项破坏关于战俘协议的狂妄要求；他要求美军当局藉口保证战俘的所谓“安全”，干涉和破坏中立国遣返委员会的职权和工作；还要求在战俘移交中立国遣返委员会看管以后，允许蒋匪特务组织保存下来。而美方釜山战俘营长官麦克加尔已经完全答应了蒋匪特务的这种狂妄要求。同时，从南朝鲜各战俘营传来的消息也证明，在美方的支持和协助下，各战俘营的李承晚特务都得到了统一的命令，组织“特务队”，对战俘进行欺骗宣传和恫吓。
    朝鲜停战签字以来，美方继续进行强迫扣留战俘的种种阴谋活动，千方百计地阻挠战俘遣返工作，这是我们决不能容忍的。现在不直接遣返的战俘已经开始交给中立国遣返委员会看管了，美方必须立即停止一切破坏关于战俘协议的阴谋活动，并采取负责和有效的措施，将潜伏在战俘营里的所有蒋介石和李承晚匪帮的特务分子逐出战俘营，以便中立国遣返委员会能够顺利行使其职权和进行其工作，以便朝中方面的代表能够充分地自由地进行其解释工作，以保证全部战俘问题得到公正合理的解决。这会大大有利于朝鲜问题的和平解决的。
