To Formulate Policies and Plans for Radically Curing the Yellow River
	Huanghe River Basin Survey Work is Actively Underway
    [Reported by this newspaper] In order to formulate policies and specific plans to eradicate the Yellow River's water disasters and effectively utilize its waterpower, survey and research work in the Yellow River basin is being actively carried out.
    Governing the Yellow River is a very complex and arduous project. It not only requires eradicating the Yellow River's floods but also fully utilizing it for power generation, irrigation, developing navigation, and other undertakings beneficial to the national economy. In the future, on the one hand, afforestation, pasture cultivation, and the construction of field and gully projects for soil and water conservation will be carried out in the vast loess areas of the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River to reduce soil erosion, maintain soil fertility, and change the climate. On the other hand, a series of large-scale hydroelectric power stations and projects for irrigation, navigation, and water supply will be built on the main stream and tributaries of the Yellow River to serve the industrial and agricultural production of the Yellow River basin. To realize this great ideal, thorough preparations must be made, starting with meticulous, in-depth, and comprehensive survey and research work.
    Since liberation, the Ministry of Water Resources and the General Bureau of Hydroelectric Power Construction of the Ministry of Fuel Industry, together with the Ministry of Geology and other departments, have organized several survey teams to conduct general surveys in the rarely visited source area of the Yellow River, as well as the Yellow River's main stream and tributaries from Guide to the estuary. They have discovered many excellent hydroelectric power generation sites in the canyon areas of the upper and middle reaches and surveyed many large reservoirs and irrigation, flood detention, and flood storage areas in the middle and lower reaches. To thoroughly clarify the main sources of Yellow River sediment and floods, this year, the Ministry of Water Resources, together with the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Forestry, the Academy of Sciences, and the Water Resources Bureaus of Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces, have organized eight survey teams to conduct comprehensive surveys of geography, geology, soil, plants, agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry in the severely eroded loess plateau area of the Northwest. The scale, quantity, and depth of this survey are unprecedented, with more than 430 experts, engineering technicians, and administrative cadres from various fields participating, surveying an area of approximately 190,000 square kilometers. The area in the Yellow River basin that needs to be surveyed for soil and water conservation is approximately 370,000 square kilometers, and more than half of it can be completed this year. In addition, another survey team led by the Ministry of Water Resources is surveying the Yellow River channel from Ningxia to Tokto and the Ordos desert area.
    In the past three years, the surveying work in the Yellow River basin has made great progress. By the end of 1952, more than 20,000 square kilometers of topographic surveying and more than 1,800 kilometers of precision leveling had been completed. The planned workload for this year is much larger than in 1952, with more than 700 personnel participating. It is estimated that by the end of this year, topographic and precision leveling surveys along the river, stretching approximately 3,700 kilometers from several mountain gorges in Qinghai Province to the Yellow River estuary in Shandong Province, can be completed. Starting in 1954, in addition to the existing staff, a large number of new personnel will be transferred to engage in topographic surveying of vast areas in the loess plateau area of the Northwest.
    Geological exploration of the Yellow River has also made progress. This year, the Ministry of Geology, the Beijing Institute of Geology, and the General Bureau of Hydroelectric Power Construction of the Ministry of Fuel Industry have cooperated to carry out geological surveying and mapping work for two key reservoirs and dam sites. The General Bureau of Hydroelectric Power Construction and the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission have organized six drilling teams, concentrating approximately 200 technical staff members, to conduct preliminary geological drilling at more than ten planned dam sites. Regarding the economic investigation of reservoirs, the investigation of two reservoirs with a total area of nearly 6,000 square kilometers was completed last year, and the field investigation of three reservoirs with a total area of more than 6,000 square kilometers was completed this year.
    Hydrological measurement is an important task in the governance of the Yellow River basin. After liberation, the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission vigorously restored and reorganized hydrological stations along the Yellow River. By the end of 1952, more than 400 various types of measuring stations, including hydrological, water level, rainfall, meteorological, and sediment measurement stations, had been established, and more than 200 more are planned to be added this year. This not only far exceeds the highest number of measuring stations in history but also has greatly improved in terms of work quality, measurement items, and personnel allocation. In addition, since September of last year, the Hydrology Bureau of the Ministry of Water Resources, the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission, and the General Bureau of Hydroelectric Power Construction have concentrated approximately 80 technical cadres to整理 the hydrological data of the main stream and tributaries of the Yellow River, with the plan to complete all of it before the end of this year.
    The survey work in the Yellow River basin is very arduous. The survey areas are either steep mountains and canyons or dry and barren loess plateaus or turbulent rapids, but because the staff recognizes the importance of their work, they have overcome various difficulties and completed various tasks ahead of schedule. For example, the areas traversed during the survey of the river source area are mostly Tibetan pastoral areas. Because the area is remote, at high altitude, and with low air pressure, even eating, sleeping, and moving are difficult, but with the help of the Tibetan brothers, the staff persisted in completing the task. The drilling work in the middle reaches of the Yellow River requires setting up drilling rigs on dangerous cliffs. When drilling on ice in winter, it is necessary to set up tents on steep rocks or live in bird holes, climbing up and down with rope ladders, but the drilling personnel accepted these tasks without fear and successfully completed them. Surveying staff also frequently traverse mountains and rivers to carry out their work. They are constantly creating various new working methods and have completed a huge workload in just a few years.
    In order to carry out the survey and research work of the Yellow River more effectively under leadership, the Yellow River Research Group was established this year under the leadership of the State Planning Commission. In addition to a large number of engineering and technical personnel and administrative cadres from the Ministry of Water Resources and the Ministry of Fuel Industry participating in the work, many experts and technical personnel from the Academy of Sciences, the Ministry of Geology, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Ministry of Forestry are also participating in various specialized research work.

    为制订根治黄河的方针和计划
    黄河流域勘测工作正在积极进行
    【本报讯】为了制订根除黄河水患和有效地利用黄河水力的方针和具体计划，黄河流域的勘测和研究工作正在积极进行。
    治理黄河是一项非常复杂和艰巨的工程，不仅要根除黄河的水灾，而且要充分利用黄河来发电、灌溉、发展航运和其他种种有益于国民经济的事业。将来，一方面要在黄河上、中游广大黄土区进行造林、培育牧草、修筑田间和沟壑工程等项水土保持工作，以减少水土流失和保持土壤肥力，并改变气候；另一方面还要在黄河干流和支流上建造一系列规模巨大的水力发电站和灌溉、航运、给水等项工程，为黄河流域的工农业生产服务。为了实现这个伟大的理想，必须进行充分的准备工作，首先就要进行细致的、深入的、全面的勘测和研究工作。
    解放以来，中央水利部和中央燃料工业部水力发电建设总局会同中央地质部等部门，组织了几个查勘队，在人迹罕见的黄河河源区以及贵德以下至海口的黄河干流和支流上进行了普遍的查勘，在上、中游峡谷地区发现了很多优良水力发电地点，在中、下游查勘了许多大型水库和灌溉、滞洪和蓄洪地区。为了彻底弄清黄河泥沙和洪水的主要来源，今年中央水利部又和农业部、林业部、科学院以及山西、陕西两省水利局，组织了八个查勘队，在水土流失比较严重的西北黄土高原区进行有关地理、地质、土壤、植物、农业、林业、牧业各方面的综合查勘。这一次查勘的工作规模、工作数量以及工作的深度都是空前的，参加工作的各方面专家、工程技术人员和行政干部共四百三十余人，查勘面积达十九万平方公里左右。黄河流域需要进行水土保持查勘的地区约三十七万平方公里，今年就可以完成半数以上。此外，中央水利部领导的另一查勘队正在查勘从宁夏到托克托的黄河河道及鄂尔多斯风沙区。
    三年来，黄河流域的测量工作有了很大的成绩，到一九五二年底已完成地形测量二万平方公里以上和精密水准测量一千八百多公里。今年计划完成的工作量比一九五二年增加很多，参加工作的人员有七百余人，预计到本年底可完成从青海省若干山峡直达山东黄河出海口长约三千七百多公里的沿河地形和精密水准测量。从一九五四年起，除现有工作人员外，还要增调大批生力军来从事西北黄土高原区广大面积的地形测量。
    黄河地质勘探工作也有了进展。今年中央地质部、北京地质学院和中央燃料工业部水力发电建设总局合作进行了两个重点水库及坝址的地质测量填图工作。水力发电建设总局和黄河水利委员会组织了六个钻探队，集中技术员工约二百人，在十余个计划中的坝址上进行初步地质钻探。关于水库经济调查工作，去年完成了总面积约近六千平方公里的两个水库的调查，今年又完成了总面积约六千余平方公里的三个水库的野外调查工作。
    水文测验是治理黄河流域工程的一项重要工作，解放后，黄河水利委员会曾大力恢复和整顿黄河沿岸各水文站，到一九五二年底已建立的水文、水位、雨量、气象、泥沙测验等各种测站达四百余处，今年计划再增加二百余处。这不但在数量上远远超过历史上最高的测站数，而且在工作质量、测验项目和人员配备方面也有了很大的提高。此外，从去年九月份起，中央水利部水文局、黄河水利委员会和水力发电建设总局又集中了技术干部约八十人整理黄河干流和支流的水文资料，计划在今年年底前全部完成。
    黄河流域的勘测工作是很艰苦的，查勘地区不是险峻的深山峡谷，就是干燥不毛的黄土高原或急流险滩，但由于工作人员认识到工作的重要性，他们克服了各种困难，提前完成了各项任务。例如查勘河源区时所经过的多为藏民牧区，因地区荒僻，海拔高，气压低，连吃饭睡觉和行动都发生困难，但在藏民弟兄的帮助下，工作人员坚持完成了任务。黄河中游的钻探工作，需要在危险的峭壁上架设钻机，冬季在冰上钻探时需在陡岩上架设帐篷或利用鸟洞居住，用绳梯上下，但钻探人员毫无畏惧地接受了并胜利地完成了这些任务。测量工作人员也经常地翻山涉水进行工作。他们不断创造各种新的工作方法，在短短数年内完成了巨大的工作量。
    为了使黄河的勘测和研究工作更有领导地进行，今年在国家计划委员会的领导下，成立了黄河研究组，除由中央水利部和中央燃料工业部抽调大批工程技术人员和行政干部参加工作外，并有科学院、地质部、农业部、林业部的许多专家和技术人员参加各种专业性的研究工作。
