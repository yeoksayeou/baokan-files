In response to the criticism and suggestions from the *People's Daily*:

    *Jiefang Daily* Editorial Office in Shanghai writes: The "Report on the Work of Newspapers: The Experiences of Several Letters of Criticism," published in the *People's Daily* on August 8th, criticized our newspaper's agricultural group for irresponsibility in handling readers' letters. We believe this criticism is entirely correct. On April 29th, our newspaper's agricultural group received a letter from Comrade茅绍廉, reflecting that cadres in Beizao Village, Longkou District, Huang County, Shandong Province, forced fishermen to plant trees during the spring flood season, causing dissatisfaction among the fishermen. Because the letter was written very simply and many specific details were not clearly explained, the editor handling the letter asked Comrade Lu Ming, who was responsible for liaison work, to write to the author to supplement the information. However, Comrade Lu Ming carelessly forwarded the original letter to the local authorities, neither specifying the purpose of forwarding the letter nor mistakenly sending the letter to掖县 (Ye County) instead of Huang County. The occurrence of this error shows that some of our newspaper's cadres are not concerned enough about the vital interests of the people and lack a sense of responsibility in their work. In order to learn from this lesson and improve our work, the agricultural group has held a meeting to review this issue and conducted criticism and self-criticism. Comrade Lu Ming has also made a written self-criticism. According to the agricultural group's review, similar incidents of irresponsibility and misdirected letters have occurred many times in the past. The group has decided to strengthen the inspection system in its work in the future.

    解放日报农业组对处理茅绍廉信件的检讨
    上海解放日报总编辑办公室来信：八月八日人民日报发表的报纸工作述评“几封批评信件的遭遇”，对我报农业组处理读者来信不负责任提出批评，我们认为这一批评完全正确。四月二十九日我报农业组收到茅绍廉同志来信，反映山东黄县龙口区北皂村干部在春汛期间强迫渔民造林，引起渔民不满等情况。由于来信写得很简单，许多具体情况没有交代清楚，处理这封信的编辑就要求负责通联工作的卢明同志写信请作者补充情况。可是卢明同志却草率地把原信转给当地机关，既未写明转信目的，又把转给黄县的信错转给掖县。这一错误的发生，表明我报有些干部对人民切身利益关心不够，工作责任心差。为吸取教训，改进工作，农业组对这个问题已开会作了检查，进行了批评与自我批评，卢明同志并作了书面检讨。据农业组检查，类似这种不负责任、错转信件的事情过去也曾多次发生，该组决定今后将加强工作的检查制度。
