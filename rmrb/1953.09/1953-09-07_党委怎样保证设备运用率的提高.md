    How Can the Party Committee Guarantee the Improvement of Equipment Utilization Rate
    Liu Shihua, Secretary of the CCP Committee of Factory 53
    The main task of the factory Party organization is to guarantee and supervise the completion and exceeding of production tasks by combining political work with economic work. Therefore, the Party's political work must permeate all aspects of economic activities.
    The factory Party organization must fully estimate the role of continuously improving the utilization rate of machinery and equipment in completing and overfulfilling production tasks, and make doing a good job in machine protection and improving equipment utilization rate an important part of the Party organization's guarantee and supervision of production.
    After the country entered the period of planned economic construction, the factory's production tasks became more arduous than in the past, and machinery and equipment and new workers continued to increase. Under these circumstances, how the Party organization educates and organizes workers to cherish machines, do a good job in machine maintenance and repair, improve equipment utilization rate, and ensure the comprehensive and balanced completion or overfulfillment of the national plan is even more important.
    In the past, we had many problems in terms of machine maintenance. For example, due to a lack of regular education, some workshop cadres and workers did not fully understand the importance of this work. Sometimes, in order to rush through tasks, they relaxed the inspection and regular maintenance of machinery and equipment. Some workers pursued quantity and did not comply with operating procedures and machine maintenance systems. The work of the Power Machinery Section and the Repair Workshop was not active enough or in-depth enough, and production efficiency was not fully utilized. Poor maintenance of machinery and equipment and the inability to fully utilize equipment capacity affected the implementation of work plans and the comprehensive and balanced completion and overfulfillment of the national plan. In order to solve this problem, the factory Party committee, in strengthening planning management, focused on the central link of compiling and implementing work plans, while investigating the situation and existing problems in machine maintenance and improving equipment utilization rate, and determined it as one of the key issues in strengthening planning management, and took necessary measures. With the strengthening of production planning, this work has also achieved initial results.
    In order to guarantee good machine maintenance and improve equipment utilization rate, the Party organization took the following measures:
    First, we constantly combined our central tasks to educate all employees about cherishing machines and complying with labor discipline, and at the same time vigorously promoted advanced experiences to improve workers' technical skills. According to the actual situation of the factory and workshops, we combined the strengthening of planning management in Party and Youth League meetings and general employee meetings to educate employees about cherishing machines, and included cherishing machines and complying with labor discipline as part of the exhibition on strengthening planning management and consolidating labor discipline and the summary and promotion of advanced ideas and advanced experiences of advanced figures held by the factory or workshop. This established the advanced banner of consistently complying with labor discipline and conscientiously implementing the machine maintenance system, and criticized the opposite erroneous ideas and behaviors, inspiring the workers' sense of responsibility as masters in the use of machines, so that they consciously cherish machine equipment, abide by relevant rules and regulations, and overcome shortcomings in machine protection work.
    Due to the needs of production development, new workers are constantly increasing in large numbers, and they are required to participate in production in a very short period of time. However, their technical level is low and they do not understand the performance and maintenance methods of machines, which often causes machine failures or excessively long repair times. Therefore, it is very important to quickly improve the technical level of new workers. We established and adhered to a system of educating new workers for a certain period of time after they enter the factory. During this period, in addition to political education, they are also educated about labor discipline, safety technical operating procedures, and machine maintenance. They are only allowed to start operating after they have certain technical knowledge. In addition, they are organized to sign apprenticeship contracts with master workers to learn the operating experience of advanced producers and improve their technical level.
    Second, mobilize and organize the masses to improve and implement the machine maintenance and repair system, and conduct in-depth competitions. We treat the machine repair and maintenance system as one of the systems related to the implementation of the work plan and improve and implement it. Under the leadership of the Party committee, the Party branch of each workshop assisted the administration in inspecting the implementation of the system in the past and the existing problems, organized technicians and workers (to combine them) to revise the machine repair and machine maintenance system of the workshop groups and individuals, determined the scope of machine repair and maintenance and specific practices, improved the daily inspection, weekly inspection, and monthly inspection system, and the special responsibility system of personnel at all levels in machine maintenance work, and clarified the content of handover. And the part related to the workers is explained to all the workers in simple and clear terms according to the current existing problems. At the same time, select and cultivate advanced figures who consistently implement the system and often complete personal action plans, and let them make demonstration reports at the general meeting of employees. After the meeting, organize the workers to check themselves against the demonstration report to inspire the workers to learn from the advanced. Then, on this basis, launch a red flag competition, and include the implementation of the machine maintenance and repair system as one of the competition contents, and conduct inspections on schedule.
    Before strengthening planning management, a group in the Fifth Workshop, due to poor machine maintenance and repair, had an average of 541 minutes of machine repair time and man-hour waste before and after driving the car every day, and an average of ten machine tools were needed every day to complete the task. After strengthening planning management, improving and implementing the machine maintenance and repair system, establishing mutual aid groups, launching mutual aid group competitions, and mobilizing the masses to find tricks and make rationalization proposals, the machine repair time was saved by 251 minutes by the end of August, and an average of nine machine tools could be used to complete the task every day. The equipment utilization rate has been improved, and the machine efficiency has been improved from 88% in the past to 94%.
    Third, strengthen the work of departments and auxiliary workshops, and further give play to the role of the Power Machinery Section and the Repair Workshop. In the past, the work of the Power Machinery Section was not active or in-depth enough; the efficiency of the Repair Workshop was not high, and the plan was not accurate. The large repair machines mentioned by the direct production workshop to the Repair Workshop generally took 30 to 35 days to repair, which was too long and affected the completion of the production task; temporary emergency machine repair tasks were carried out by the repair group of the direct production workshop. In strengthening planning management, in order to overcome these shortcomings, the Party committee organized forces to assist the Repair Workshop in implementing rhythmic production organized according to the instruction charts. The machine repair task for the current month was issued by the section to the Repair Workshop on the 20th of the previous month, and the Repair Workshop formulated a pre-repair plan as early as possible and carried out the maintenance according to the plan. At the same time, the advanced experience of the Soviet Chirnykh "machine repair area responsibility system" was promoted.
    Under the guidance of the Power Machinery Section, the Repair Workshop established a contract repair team to carry out repair work in the workshop. When a key experiment was carried out in a certain process in the Second Workshop, the workers believed that the contract repair team was here to monitor them, and the foreman did not support it, so the personnel of the contract repair team had concerns. The workshop Party branch and the workshop director gave strong support to the work of the contract repair team, and after persuading the workers and foremen, they unified their thinking so that the contract repair team could carry out its work smoothly. The foreman took the initiative to introduce the machine equipment situation to the team, and the personnel of the contract repair team regularly checked the machine protection situation, urged the workers to implement the machine maintenance system, and solved the problems immediately after they were found. This has close the link between the repair personnel and the production team, and eliminated the phenomenon of often arguing for repairing machines in the past. The people of the contract repair team said: "This time, we have become familiar with the machine, and we can know where there is a problem." The foreman said: "With the contract repair team, there is also a way to master the machine." In the past, this process could not prevent machine failures, and when there was a failure, it was a big one; the Repair Workshop often had to pull the machine to the workshop for repair during production time because it was not familiar enough with the machine. Now, it is possible to repair it on the spot without occupying production time, and at the same time, it can prevent machine failures. In the past, this process could not complete the task of twenty units with twenty-two machine tools, and now it can complete the task of twenty-two units with only nineteen machine tools. In this way, we further promoted the successful experience of the contract repair team in the Second Workshop to other workshops.
    Since the Repair Workshop organized rhythmic production, it greatly improved the balance of machine repair. For example, the balance rate of the workshop was 90.6% in May, and it increased to 92.9% in June, which played a certain role in ensuring the normal operation of machine tools in the production workshop and improving the equipment utilization rate.
    Although we have done some work and achieved initial results, it is still very insufficient. The promotion of relevant advanced experience is not enough, the implementation of technical measures plans is slow, the workers' implementation of the machine maintenance system is not good enough, and the machine repair time for some processes is still too long. These shortcomings affect the further improvement of the equipment utilization rate. When deepening planning management work, the Party organization will continue to strengthen and improve this aspect of work.

    党委怎样保证设备运用率的提高
    中共五三厂委员会书记  刘诗华
    工厂党组织的主要任务，是用政治工作和经济工作相结合的方法保证与监督生产任务的完成与超过。因此，党的政治工作必须渗透到经济活动的各个方面。
    工厂党组织必须充分估计到机器设备运用率的不断提高对完成和超额完成生产任务的作用，并把做好机器保护工作、提高设备运用率作为党组织保证与监督生产的一个重要内容。
    国家进入有计划经济建设时期后，工厂的生产任务比过去更加繁重，机器设备和新工人不断增加，在这种情况下，党组织如何教育与组织职工爱护机器，做好机器保养、检修工作，提高设备运用率，保证全面地均衡地完成或超额完成国家计划，就更加显得重要。
    过去我们在保养机器这方面存在着很多问题。如由于缺乏经常的教育，有些车间干部和工人对这一工作的重要性认识不足，有时为了突击任务放松了对机器设备的检查和定期检修；工人中有追求数量，不遵守操作规程和机器保养制度的现象；动力机械科和机修车间的工作不够主动、不够深入，生产效率没有充分发挥。机器设备保养不好，设备能力不能充分发挥，就影响作业计划的贯彻和全面地均衡地完成与超额完成国家计划。为解决这一问题，工厂党委会在加强计划管理工作中，围绕着编制与贯彻作业计划这一中心环节，同时调查了保养机器，提高设备运用率方面的情况和存在的问题，并确定把它作为加强计划管理工作的关键问题之一，采取了必要的措施。随着生产计划性的加强，这一工作也同时取得了初步的成绩。
    党组织为了保证做好机器保养工作、提高设备运用率，采取了如下的做法：
    第一、不断地结合中心工作向全体职工进行爱护机器和遵守劳动纪律的教育，同时大力推广先进经验，提高工人的技术水平。我们根据全厂和车间的实际情况，在党和青年团的会议和全体职工大会上结合加强计划管理工作向职工进行爱护机器的教育，并把爱护机器、遵守劳动纪律作为厂或车间举办的加强计划管理和巩固劳动纪律的展览会和总结推广先进人物的先进思想和先进经验的内容之一。这样就树立了一贯遵守劳动纪律、认真贯彻机器保养制度的先进旗帜，并批判了与此相反的错误思想和行为，启发了职工在使用机器方面的主人翁的责任感，使他们自觉地爱护机器设备，遵守有关的规程制度，克服在保护机器工作中的缺点。
    由于生产发展的需要，新工人不断地大量增加，并要求他们在很短时间内参加生产。但他们的技术水平低，不懂机器的性能和保养方法，因而常常引起机器故障或者是机修时间过长。因此迅速提高新工人的技术水平是很重要的工作。我们建立并坚持了新工人入厂后在一定时期内进行教育的制度。在这一时期内，除向他们进行政治教育外，同时进行有关劳动纪律和安全技术操作规程和机器保养的教育。等他们具备一定技术知识后，才让他们开始操作。此外还组织他们和老师傅订立师徒合同，学习先进生产者的操作经验，提高他们的技术水平。
    第二、发动与组织群众健全与贯彻机器保养和检修制度，深入开展竞赛。对于机器检修保养制度我们是作为与贯彻作业计划有关的制度之一加以健全与贯彻的。在党委领导下，各车间支部协助行政检查了过去贯彻制度的情况和存在的问题，组织技术人员和工人（使他们结合起来）修订车间小组和个人的机器检修和机器保养制度，确定了机器检修和保养范围以及具体作法，健全了日查、周查、月查制和各级人员在保养机器工作上的专责制，明确了交接班的内容。并将与工人有关的部分根据当前存在的问题向全体工人进行通俗简明的讲解。同时选择和培养一贯执行制度、经常完成个人行动计划的先进人物，让他在全体职工大会上做示范报告。会后组织工人对照着示范报告检查自己，以启发工人向先进者看齐。然后在这基础上展开红旗竞赛，把贯彻机器保养、检修制度作为竞赛内容之一，按期进行检查。
    五车间有一个小组在加强计划管理以前，由于机器保养、检修不好，平均每天有五百四十一分钟的机修时间和开车前后的工时浪费，平均每天需用十台机床才能完成任务。经过加强计划管理，健全与贯彻机器保养、检修制度，建立互助组，展开互助组的竞赛，并发动群众找窍门、提合理化建议，到八月底止机修时间节省二百五十一分钟，平均每天开动九台机床就可以完成任务。设备运用率提高了，机器效能的发挥由过去的百分之八十八提高到百分之九十四。
    第三、加强科室工作和辅助车间工作，进一步发挥动力机械科和机修车间的作用。过去动力机械科工作不够主动、深入；机修车间效率不高，计划不准确。直接生产车间提到机修车间的大修机器一般要三十至三十五天才能修完，时间过长，影响生产任务的完成；临时紧急的机修任务，靠直接生产车间的修理组进行修理。在加强计划管理中，为了克服这些缺点，党委会组织力量协助机修车间实行按指示图表组织有节奏生产，当月机修任务在上月二十日就由科发到机修车间，机修车间及早制订预修计划，按计划进行检修。同时推行了苏联齐尔尼赫“机器检修区域负责制”的先进经验。
    机修车间在动力机械科的指导下成立了包修小组到车间进行修理工作。在二车间某一工序进行重点试验时，工人认为包修小组是来监视他们的，工长也不支持，因此包修小组人员产生了顾虑。车间党支部和车间主任对包修小组的工作给予大力支持，对工人工长进行了说服教育后，统一了思想，使包修小组得以顺利地展开工作。工长主动向小组介绍机器设备情况，包修小组人员经常检查机器保护情况，督促工人贯彻机器保养制度，发现问题立即解决。这样就密切了机修人员与生产小组的联系，消除了过去常为修机器争吵的现象。包修小组的人说：“这回可把机器摸熟了，哪里有毛病就能知道。”工长说：“有了包修小组，掌握机器也有办法了。”过去，这个工序不能预防机器故障的发生，出了故障就是大的；机修车间由于对机器不够熟悉，常常要在生产时间把机器拉到车间修理。现在做到不占用生产时间就地修理，同时也能预防机器故障的发生。这个工序过去用二十二台机床还不能完成二十台的任务，现在仅用十九台机床就能完成二十二台的任务。这样我们就进一步把包修小组在二车间工作的成功经验在其他车间推广。
    机修车间由于组织了有节奏生产，大大提高了机修的均衡性，如该车间的均衡率在五月份为百分之九十点六，六月份即提高到百分之九十二点九，对保证生产车间机床正常运转，提高设备运用率，起了一定的作用。
    我们虽然作了一些工作并取得了初步的成绩，但仍很不够，有关先进经验推广得不够，技术措施计划实现得慢，工人贯彻机器保养制度的情况还不够好，有些工序机修时间仍然过长等，这些缺点都影响设备运用率的进一步提高。在深入计划管理工作时，党组织将要继续加强并改进这一方面的工作。
