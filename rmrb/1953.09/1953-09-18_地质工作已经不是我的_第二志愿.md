    Geological Work Is No Longer My "Second Choice"
    Li Peiyu, Student of the Special Training Course at Beijing Geological College

    I have been studying at the Beijing Geological College's Special Training Course for a year now. The school has nurtured and trained me like a mother. I have completed fifteen courses; during the summer vacation, I basically learned fieldwork methods and drew a 1:25,000 geological map; moreover, my physical fitness has also improved. Now, I can climb very high mountains and carry specimens for dozens of miles. I am no longer afraid of climbing mountains and wading through rivers.

    Looking back a year ago, I did not understand geological work well enough. I didn't know what kind of knowledge it contained, and I didn't understand how geologists worked in the field. The thought of climbing mountains and wading through rivers made me worry about my physical endurance... But I knew one thing: the country's industrialization needs resources. Without geologists exploring underground treasures, the country's heavy industry would have no raw materials. The sense of responsibility and honor of a young person encouraged me. I couldn't push difficult work to others, so I came to the Geological College as my second choice.

    The internship experience told me that fieldwork is not as difficult as I imagined. In the field, we don't spend all day trekking and getting exhausted. Geological work is scientific work, and it has a set of scientific working methods. Now we have adopted the Soviet "geological point" system in the field, which makes our work purposeful and orderly. We don't necessarily walk very long distances every day, and we don't have to climb every mountain top, rushing straight to the summit like travelers; we have a certain amount of work to do, and we make observations within the planned scope of work every day. Of course, we have to go to the mountains or ditches to obtain certain materials, just like a mechanical engineering student has to learn to blacksmithing and sand casting. We don't feel forced at all.

    Northwest of Qixia Mountain in Zhoukoudian, there are three small hills. Because of its complex structure and poor outcrops (rocks exposed on the surface), we spent the most time "mushrooming" there during the summer vacation, so we called it "Mushroom Mountain". It was this small mountain that attracted so many people! Everyone asked to work there. I had been there three times, and the last time I automatically ran there after completing the work in other areas. The road to get there was very long, and it was full of narrow paths. Since I didn't have a task that I had to complete there, why did I still have to go instead of going home to rest? Even I myself wouldn't have understood this before the internship. But who knows how those uncertain faults and those irregularly oriented outcrops attracted me, who knows how the heated discussions about structural problems at our group meetings inspired me—whoever has the most materials, their opinions are closer to the truth.

    Once, everyone was a little tired. On the way back, we suddenly found fossils near a coal seam, and everyone immediately forgot their fatigue. Suddenly, there were the clanging sounds of hammers and joyful laughter everywhere. One classmate found a complete pyrite crystal—we had never seen such a beautiful and shiny specimen even at school. He jumped up with joy. On the way home, everyone's backpacks were filled with wheel wood, lepidodendron, pteridospermae, and pyrite-mineralized tree trunks and roots. It was difficult to maintain the center of gravity when going down the mountain, and the straps of the backpacks were pressing on our shoulders; but we knew what we were doing: these specimens would be placed in our practice room, and new students would use these specimens to master geological knowledge... Thinking of this, who would feel tired?

    Fieldwork is no longer as monotonous and difficult as I imagined. It is fresh and enjoyable. Now I am dedicating everything to our young geological cause. Facing high mountains and deep valleys, I feel as interesting as a worker facing a machine. I feel the same high sentiment when I am filling out geological maps as workers feel when they are operating lathes, farmers feel when they are plowing the land, and soldiers feel when they are guarding the border. Our work means prosperity. Wherever our footprints reach, drilling rigs will be erected, and mines and factories will appear. Every time we go to a place, the villagers cordially ask about our work and eagerly hope that we can discover some treasures in their hometown, as if we are messengers of happiness. This scene inspires us to move forward.

    Fieldwork has difficulties, but, in any case, this cannot be compared with our great ideals, in any way!

    Now I no longer regard geological work as a "second choice." I understand that geological work is not only magnificent, being the vanguard of the country's industrialization, but also a very interesting scientific work. I will dedicate the light and heat of my life to the beloved geological work.

### 地质工作已经不是我的“第二志愿”

    地质工作已经不是我的“第二志愿”
    北京地质学院专修科学生  李佩玉
    我在北京地质学院专修科学习已经一年了。学校像母亲般地培养了我，锻炼了我。我已经学完了十五门课程；暑假当中，又基本上学会了野外的工作方法，填绘了一张二万五千分之一的地质图；而且，我的体质也增强了。现在，我可以攀登很高的山，可以背着标本走几十里路。我再也不怕爬山涉水了。
    回想一年以前，我对地质工作还是不够了解的。我不知道它包含些什么学问，我更不了解地质工作者在野外怎样工作，我一想到登山涉水就怕身体支持不了……。但有一件事我是知道的：祖国的工业化需要资源，没有地质工作者发掘地下的宝藏，祖国的重工业就没有原料。青年人的责任感和荣誉心鼓舞着我，我不能把困难工作推给别人，于是我来到了我第二志愿的地质学院。
    实习生活告诉我，野外工作并不像我所想像的那样困难。在野外，我们并不是整天长途跋涉、疲乏得要命。地质工作是科学工作，它有一套科学的工作方法。现在我们采用了苏联野外“地质点”的制度，工作起来是有目的的，而且很有秩序。我们并不一定每天都走很远很远的路，也并不是每一个山头都要爬上去，像旅行家那样冲呀冲地直奔高山之巅；我们有一定的工作量，每天都在事先计划好的工作范围内进行观察；为了取得某种材料我们当然要到山上或沟里去，就像一个学机械的，他一定要学打铁、翻砂一样，一点也不觉得勉强。
    周口店旗山西北有三个小山包，由于它的构造复杂，露头（露出在地表面的石头）不好，暑假期间我们在那里蘑菇的时间最多，因此叫它为“蘑菇山”。就是这座小山它曾吸引了多少人呀！大家都要求到那里去工作。我曾去过三次，最后一次是我在完成了别的区域的工作自动跑去的。到那里的路很远，而且尽是羊肠小道。我既然没有必须去那里完成的任务，为什么还一定要去，而不回家休息休息呢？这在实习以前，就连我自己也不会理解的。但是有谁知道那些不敢肯定的断层，那些走向不规则的露头是怎样地吸引着我，有谁知道我们在小组会上讨论构造问题时的那种热烈场面怎样激励着我——谁掌握的材料最多，谁的意见就更接近于正确。
    有一次，大家有些疲乏了。归途中，忽然在煤层附近发现了化石，大家一下子就把疲倦忘光了，谁还想到回家休息呢。顿时，到处都是铁锤的铿锵声和惊喜的欢笑声。有一位同学打到了完整的黄铁矿晶体——就是在学校里也没有看到过这样漂亮的、闪闪发光的标本呀，他高兴得跳起来了。回家的路上，大家的背包里放满了轮木、鳞木、翅羊齿和黄铁矿化的树干和树根，下山时重心都不太好掌握，背包的带子压得肩膀发痛；但是我们知道我们在作些什么：这些标本将放到我们的实习室里，新同学将利用这些标本掌握地质知识……想到这些，谁还会觉得累呢。
    野外工作再也不是我所想像的那样单调那样困难了，它是新鲜而愉快的。现在我是将自己的一切，全部交给我们年青的地质事业了。我面对着高山深谷就像工人面对着机器那样有趣，我填绘地质图的心情就像工人在开动车床、农民在耕地、战士在守卫着边疆那样，人们都会知道那是一种多么高尚的心情。我们的工作就意味着富强。我们足迹踏到的地方就会架起井架，就会出现矿山和工厂。每到一个地方，老乡们都是亲切地问长问短，热切地希望我们能在他们的家乡发现什么宝物，好像我们就是幸福的使者一样。这情景激励着我们前进。
    野外工作是有困难的，但是，这无论如何也不能和我们的伟大理想相比，无论如何也不能！
    现在我再也不把地质工作当作什么“第二志愿”了。我懂得，地质事业不但是壮丽的，是祖国工业化的尖兵部队，而且它是一种极有趣的科学工作。我将把我生命的光和热贡献给亲爱的地质工作。
