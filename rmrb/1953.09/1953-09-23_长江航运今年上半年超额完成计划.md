Yangtze River shipping exceeded the state transportation plan in the first half of this year. In terms of passenger transport, the number of passengers exceeded the plan by 90.7 percent, and passenger-kilometers exceeded the plan by 46.4 percent. In terms of freight transport, the tonnage of goods exceeded the plan by 21.8 percent, and ton-kilometers exceeded the plan by 19.1 percent. The transportation efficiency of both joint state-private and private ships has improved.

The Yangtze River is the largest inland river in our country. Currently, navigation is possible year-round on the 2,000-kilometer route from Shanghai to Yibin, Sichuan. The six provinces along the river, including Sichuan, Hunan, and Jiangsu, are the main agricultural areas of our country, rich in products and with a population of nearly 200 million. Since liberation, with the rapid rise of industrial and agricultural production in the country, especially since the beginning of planned economic construction this year, the exchange of materials has become increasingly busy, and the volume of passenger and freight transportation has continued to rise. If the transportation volume in 1950 is taken as 100, it increased to 125.3 in 1952, and is expected to reach 170.29 in 1953.

One of the important reasons why Yangtze River shipping exceeded the transportation task in the first half of this year is the rapid improvement in the efficiency of ship transportation. According to the plan, the main efficiency indicators for the Yangtze River Shipping Administration's ships this year are 146.6 ton-kilometers for passenger and cargo ship ton-days, 288 ton-kilometers for tug horsepower-days, and 45.3 ton-kilometers for barge ton-days. Compared with 1951, the efficiency of passenger and cargo ships increased by 94.3 percent, tugs increased by 211.1 percent, and barges increased by 53.4 percent. The efficiency of tugs has increased the most, mainly due to the result of the Yangtze River ships learning and promoting the Soviet advanced experience - the single-row tug-barge transportation method. This advanced production method has been widely promoted on the entire Yangtze River this year. The highest record in the first half of the year has reached 9.83 tons towed upstream per horsepower of tug and 14.4 tons downstream, an increase of four to five times compared to before liberation.

While the transportation efficiency of state-owned ships has improved, the transportation efficiency of joint state-private and private ships has also improved. The Min Sheng Shipping Company, a joint state-private enterprise, is expected to complete a 54.6 percent increase in transportation volume this year compared to last year.

The Yangtze River shipping's exceeding the plan is also due to the strong support and assistance of Party and government leading organs along the line in improving port work. In the first half of this year, the loading and unloading efficiency of various ports along the Yangtze River has generally improved significantly. The loading and unloading efficiency of Nanjing Port in the second quarter of this year increased by 184 percent compared to the fourth quarter of last year, Chongqing Port increased by 96 percent during the same period, and Jiujiang Port increased by 79 percent; the average loading and unloading efficiency per man-hour at Yichang Port was 681 kilograms in April, 735 kilograms in May, and 773 kilograms in June, with the highest reaching 2,376 kilograms per man-hour, greatly accelerating ship turnaround.

Since liberation, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and governments at all levels, Yangtze River shipping has changed the backward and chaotic situation of Yangtze River shipping in old China and has played a certain role in the country's economic construction. However, there are still some problems and shortcomings in the current Yangtze River shipping work: the implementation of the monthly transportation plan is loose at the beginning and tight at the end, and the potential of ship transportation cannot be fully utilized; the progress of port work is relatively slow, and the loading and unloading efficiency of some ports has remained at a very low level for a long time, which greatly affects ship turnaround; the planning of ship repair work is insufficient, and the repair quality is poor, so that the operating efficiency of ships cannot be further improved. These problems have a great impact on the development of Yangtze River shipping and urgently need to be greatly improved.

### 长江航运今年上半年超额完成计划

    长江航运今年上半年超额完成计划
    长江航运今年上半年超额完成了国家运输计划。在客运方面，旅客人数超过计划百分之九十点七，人公里超过计划百分之四十六点四；在货运方面，货物吨数超过计划百分之二十一点八，吨公里超过百分之十九点一。公私合营和私营船舶的运输效率都有提高。
    长江是我国最大的一条内河。目前从上海至四川宜宾长达二千余公里的航线上已能终年航行。沿江的四川、湖南、江苏等六省都是我国主要的农作区，物产丰饶，居民近两亿人。解放后，长江航运，随着国家工农业生产的迅速上升，特别是今年开始进入有计划的经济建设以来，物资交流日益繁忙，客货运输量不断上涨。如以一九五○年运量为一百，则一九五二年增加为一百二十五点三，一九五三年预计将达一百七十点二九。
    长江航运今年上半年超额完成运输任务的重要原因之一，是由于船舶运输效率的迅速提高。长江航运管理局的船舶，根据计划规定，今年的主要效率指标，客货轮吨天生产量是一百四十六点六吨公里，拖轮马力天生产量是二百八十八吨公里，驳船吨天生产量是四十五点三吨公里。和一九五一年相比，则客货轮效率提高百分之九十四点三，拖轮提高百分之二百十一点一，驳船提高百分之五十三点四。拖轮效率提高最大，主要是由于长江船舶学习和推行了苏联先进经验——一列式拖驳运输法的结果。今年这一先进生产方法已在长江全线普遍推行，上半年最高纪录已达到拖轮每马力上水拖运九点八三吨，下水十四点四吨，较解放前提高了四倍至五倍。
    与国营船舶运输效率提高的同时，公私合营与私营船舶的运输效率也均有提高。公私合营的民生轮船公司，今年预计完成运输量较去年将增加百分之五十四点六。
    长江航运超额完成计划还在于沿线各港党政领导机关大力支持和协助改进港湾工作。今年上半年长江各港的装卸效率一般都提高不少，南京港装卸效率今年第二季度较去年第四季度提高了百分之一百八十四，重庆港同期提高了百分之九十六，九江港提高了百分之七十九；宜昌港四月份平均每工时装卸效率为六百八十一公斤，五月份平均为七百三十五公斤，六月份平均为七百七十三公斤，最高的达到每工时装卸二千三百七十六公斤，从而大大地加速了船舶周转。
    长江航运，解放以来，在中国共产党和各级人民政府的正确领导下，改变了旧中国长江航运落后紊乱的面貌，对祖国的经济建设起了一定的作用。但是，长江航运工作目前仍然存在着一些问题和缺点：每月执行运输计划先松后紧，船舶运输潜力不能充分发挥；港湾工作进步比较迟缓，有些港口的装卸效率长期停留在很低的水平上，大大影响了船舶周转；修船工作计划性不足，而且修理质量低劣，以致不能进一步提高船舶营运效率等。这些问题对于长江航运的发展都有极大影响，急待大力改进。
