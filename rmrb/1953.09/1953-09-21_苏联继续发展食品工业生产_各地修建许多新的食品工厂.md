    Xinhua News Agency, 20th Dispatch: According to TASS news: The Soviet Union is continuously developing the production of the food industry. Compared with 1940, the Soviet Union's meat production this year will increase by 60%, sausage by 50%, canned meat by 400%, sugar by almost 70%, and butter production will be almost 80% higher than the pre-war cheese and butter production level. Currently, food industry enterprises in various regions of the Soviet Union are working hard to increase production, and new enterprises are being vigorously constructed.
    In Moscow, the Mikoyan Meat Combine Factory is building some new departments and factory buildings. This factory will increase the production of high-quality meat products this year. The production of superior packaged meat will increase threefold, and the production of steak, pork chunks, fried beef chunks, and other semi-finished products will increase by one to two times. The Moscow Fish Combine Factory is also being expanded. Currently, this factory can produce 150 kinds of fish products. After the newly built pickled fish workshop is put into production this year, the factory will produce 27% more pickled fish than last year. The Bolshevik Biscuit Factory is installing the latest equipment, including continuous production devices with fully automated production processes. Currently, this factory is producing more than 100 kinds of biscuits, snacks, pastries, etc., with a daily output of 175,000 kilograms; by October, the daily output will increase to 190,000 kilograms—almost twice that of 1948. In order to continuously meet the meat food needs of Moscow residents, a new sausage factory has recently started production in Moscow, and another sausage factory will be completed and put into production in November this year.
    The Belorussian Republic is building two giant meat combines with sausage and canning departments, five livestock slaughterhouses with refrigeration equipment, and five poultry processing factories. In Minsk, Mogilev, Orsha, and other cities in Belarus, milk factories equipped with the latest machines, cheese factories capable of producing condensed milk, milk powder, lactose, and butter factories will soon be put into production. Currently, the number of cheese factories and butter factories in Belarus alone is five times greater than in 1940.
    In the next three years, the Ukrainian Republic will build 170 new bread factories, confectionery factories, meat combines, and poultry processing factories. Many existing food factories will be renovated. This year, the total value of the products of the Ukrainian food industry will reach 14.5 billion rubles, an increase of 50.9% compared to 1950. The bread, confectionery, and canning industries have been able to produce 520 different kinds of food.
    The food industry in the southern Soviet republics is also developing. Armenia will produce 160 million rubles more worth of food this year than last year. Currently, many regions of the republic are building new food factories, such as new meat product factories being built in Kapan and Kirovakan. Recently, a winery in the republic's capital, Yerevan, with an annual output of 500,000 decaliters (each decaliter equals one city peck) of brandy and wine, has been put into production. The Kyrgyz Republic is developing a new sector in the food industry—the brewing industry. This year, collective farms and state-owned farms in the republic have planted fine varieties of grapes for making champagne on 1,500 hectares (each hectare equals 15 mu); the newly built champagne factory outside the capital, Frunze, will begin production during this year's grape harvest season. In Karaganda, Semipalatinsk, and other large cities in the Kazakh Republic, mechanized bread baking factories equipped with the latest machines are also being built.

    苏联继续发展食品工业生产
    各地修建许多新的食品工厂
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社消息：苏联正在不断发展食品工业的生产。和一九四○年相比，苏联今年的肉类生产将增加百分之六十，腊肠将增加百分之五十，罐头肉类将增加百分之四百，糖差不多将增加百分之七十，牛油产量将差不多比战前奶酪、牛油生产水平高百分之八十。现在，苏联各地的食品工业企业正在努力增加生产，新的企业正在大力建设中。
    在莫斯科，米高扬肉类联合工厂正在建造一些新的部门和厂房。该厂本年度将要增产优等肉类产品，如上等的包装肉类将增加三倍，牛排、猪肉块、煎牛肉块和其他半制成品将增加一倍到两倍。莫斯科鱼类联合工厂也在扩建中。目前这个工厂已能制造一百五十种的鱼制品。今年新建的腌鱼车间投入生产后，该厂将比去年多生产百分之二十七的腌鱼。布尔什维克饼干工厂正在安装最新的设备，包括全部生产过程自动化的连续生产装置。目前这个工厂正在制造一百多种饼干、点心和糕饼等，每日产量达十七万五千公斤；到十月间，日产量将增为十九万公斤——几乎等于一九四八年的两倍。为了不断满足莫斯科居民肉食品的需要，莫斯科最近又有一个新的腊肠工厂开工生产，另一个腊肠工厂将在今年十一月建成后投入生产。
    白俄罗斯共和国正在兴建两个设有腊肠部和制罐头部的巨型肉类联合工厂、五个有冷藏设备的牲畜屠宰场和五个家禽加工工厂。在明斯克、莫吉略夫、奥尔沙和白俄罗斯其他城市，安装有最新式机器的牛乳厂，能够生产炼乳、奶粉、乳糖等制酪工厂和牛油制造厂，不久就可开工生产。目前单是白俄罗斯的乳酪厂和牛油制造厂的数目，就比一九四○年增加五倍。
    乌克兰共和国在今后三年中将新建一百七十个面包工厂、糖果工厂、肉类联合工厂和家禽加工工厂等。许多原有的食品工厂将实行改建。今年乌克兰食品工业的产品总值将达一百四十五亿卢布，比一九五○年增加百分之五十点九。面包、糖果和罐头制造工业，已能生产五百二十种不同的食品。
    苏联南部各加盟共和国的食品工业也在发展中。亚美尼亚今年将比去年多生产价值一亿六千万卢布的食品。现在，共和国的许多地区正在兴建新的食品工厂，例如在卡凡和基洛发堪城正在建造新的肉类制品工厂。最近共和国首都埃里温已有一个年产五十万公斗（每公斗合一市斗）白兰地和葡萄酒的酿酒工厂投入生产了。吉尔吉斯共和国正在发展食品工业中的新部门——酿酒工业。共和国的集体农庄和国营农场，今年已在一千五百公顷（每公顷合十五市亩）的土地上种植了酿制香槟酒的良种葡萄；首都伏龙芝郊外新建的香槟酒制造厂将在今年葡萄收获季节开始生产。在哈萨克共和国的卡拉干达、塞米巴拉丁和其他大城市，也在建造装有最新型机器的机械化面包焙制工厂。
