Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, September 3rd: The Third World Student Congress concluded in Warsaw on the 2nd. The congress elected a new council for the International Union of Students (IUS), which includes representatives from all student organizations participating in the IUS. At the closing meeting, the congress adopted a decision by the IUS Council to elect an Executive Committee of twenty-two members. Joe Bellenger of Italy was elected President of the IUS; representatives from student organizations in China, Ecuador, Canada, and the Soviet Union were elected Vice-Presidents. The congress also decided to reserve two Vice-Presidents for representatives from French and British student organizations. Yuri Berlikon of Czechoslovakia was elected General Secretary of the IUS.

The congress adopted resolutions on the development of international sports, the situation of students in colonial, dependent, and underdeveloped countries, cultural exchanges between students of various countries, economic and social issues and access to education for all, student newspapers, and other issues.

The congress passed a resolution on the report presented to the congress by IUS General Secretary Berlikon on behalf of the IUS Executive Committee, and adopted a Message to Students of the World.

The resolution passed by the congress on Berlikon's report stated: The congress notes with satisfaction that in recent years, the IUS and national and local student organizations in various countries have strengthened their activities, more actively safeguarding the urgent needs of students, and implementing measures aimed at further strengthening students' friendship and unity. The congress also noted the difficult situation of students in colonial and dependent countries.

The Message to Students of the World, adopted by the congress, stated: We, student representatives from all over the world, gathered in Warsaw, where we freely discussed and exchanged views on our common problems, and formulated plans to solve these problems.

We come from different countries. Among us are conservatives and liberals, socialists and communists, Catholics and Christians, Orthodox and Muslims. Despite our different beliefs and convictions, we can still reach agreement and mutual understanding on many important issues concerning student life and education, and on issues related to the student movement. We firmly believe that it is necessary for all student organizations, whether or not they are members of the IUS, to intensify their struggle to meet students' needs and demands.

We have decided to expand international cooperation among students in education, culture, and sports, and to exchange delegations, cultural and sports groups, organize exhibitions, and exchange literature more widely on a reciprocal basis. We firmly believe that there is no reason to divide the world student movement, and that there are no insurmountable obstacles to strengthening the unity and friendship of students worldwide.

Hundreds of millions of ordinary people in all countries share a common idea and a common desire: to maintain peace and strengthen international solidarity. The congress, together with the people of all countries, calls on you - students, both male and female - to demand consultations to resolve international disputes. Our education and work require world peace.

After summarizing the work of the congress, Berlikon announced the closing of the congress amidst a storm of prolonged applause. The delegates stood up and sang the IUS anthem and the World Democratic Youth anthem in unison.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, September 1st (Delayed): The Chinese student delegation attending the Third World Student Congress was invited by the Soviet student delegation on August 30th to hold a get-together with Soviet students.

    第三届世界学生代表大会闭幕
    选出新的国际学联理事会，通过告全世界学生书
    【新华社四日讯】据塔斯社华沙三日讯：第三届世界学生代表大会于二日在华沙闭幕。大会选出了国际学生联合会新的理事会，新理事会包括所有参加国际学联的学生组织的代表。在闭幕会议上，大会通过国际学联理事会关于选出一个由二十二个委员组成的国际学联执行委员会的决定。意大利的乔·贝林格当选为国际学联主席；中国、厄瓜多尔、加拿大和苏联学生组织代表当选为副主席。大会并决定为法国和英国学生组织代表保留两个副主席。捷克斯洛伐克的尤里·贝利康当选为国际学联总书记。
    大会通过了关于发展国际体育，关于殖民地、附属国和落后国家学生的情况，关于各国学生之间的文化交流，关于经济与社会问题以及使所有的人都能受到教育，关于学生报纸以及其他问题的建议。
    大会就国际学联总书记贝林格代表国际学联执行委员会向大会提出的报告通过一项决议，并通过了告全世界学生书。
    大会就贝林格的报告通过的决议说：大会满意地指出，近年来，国际学联与各国全国性的和地方性的学生组织加强了它们的活动，更加积极地维护学生的迫切需要，实行旨在进一步加强学生的友谊与团结的措施。大会并注意到殖民地与附属国学生的困难情况。
    大会通过的告全世界学生书说：我们来自世界各地的学生代表在华沙聚集一堂，我们就我们的共同问题进行了自由讨论和交换意见，并且制订了解决这些问题的计划。
    我们来自不同的国家。我们之中有保守党人也有自由主义者，有社会党人也有共产党人，有天主教徒也有基督教徒，有正教徒也有回教徒。尽管我们的信仰与信念不同，但是我们一样可以在关于学生生活与教育的许多重要问题上，在学生运动问题上取得一致的意见以及相互的谅解。我们坚信一切已加入和未加入国际学联的学生组织有必要加紧为争取满足学生的需要与要求而进行斗争。
    我们决定扩大各国学生在教育、文化与运动方面的国际合作，并在互惠的基础上，更广泛地互派代表团，互派文化与体育团体，组织展览会与文学的交流。我们坚信，没有理由分裂世界学生运动，没有不可克服的障碍使得不能加强全世界学生的团结与友谊。
    各国千百万普通人民共同具有一个思想与一个愿望，就是维护和平，加强国际团结。大会与世界各国人民一道，要求你们——男女学生们，起来要求进行协商，以解决国际争端。我们的教育与工作需要世界和平。
    贝林格在总结了大会的工作以后，在暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声中宣布大会闭幕。代表们起立齐声高唱国际学联进行曲与世界民主青年进行曲。
    【新华社华沙一日电】（迟到）出席第三届世界学生代表大会的我国学生代表团，八月三十日应苏联学生代表团的邀请，与苏联学生代表举行联欢会。
    联欢会上，中苏两国学生代表交流了学习经验，并交换了礼物。大家在一起欢乐，在一起歌唱。代表们并为中苏友谊和两国人民领袖的健康而干杯。我国学生代表在会上表示，中国学生将永远以苏联学生作为学习的榜样。
