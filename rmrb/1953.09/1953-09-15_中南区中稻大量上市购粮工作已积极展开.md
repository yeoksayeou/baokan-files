Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, September 14th: Since June, crops such as wheat, early rice, and middle-season rice have been successively entering the market in the Central-South region, a major grain-producing area of China. Because middle-season rice accounts for a very large proportion of the total grain output in Central-South China, the current large-scale market entry of middle-season rice has pushed the region's grain purchasing work into a new high tide. Since the end of August, in major rice-producing areas such as Hunan, Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Hubei, the amount of new grain entering the market every day has reached 50 to 60 million catties. In the plains along Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake, the amount of rice entering the market in some areas has exceeded last year's highest record. Thanks to the enthusiastic sales of new grain by the vast number of farmers, from the time new grain entered the market in June to the end of August, the total amount of wheat and rice purchased by grain departments and cooperatives in the region increased by 37% compared to the same period last year. Among them, wheat has completed more than 84% of the annual purchase plan. In August, due to the simultaneous market entry of early and middle-season rice, the amount of new grain purchased in the region increased by more than one and a half times compared to July.
　　The Central-South region starts the peak season for new grain entering the market every year from June, when wheat from Henan enters the market. Afterwards, early rice, middle-season rice, and late rice from provinces along the Yangtze River successively enter the market, and farmers sell grain until autumn and winter. This year, farmers in various places are selling new grain slightly earlier than in previous years. In order to meet the needs of farmers selling grain in various places, state-owned grain departments and cooperatives in the Central-South region have expanded their purchasing forces, with purchasing points all over the medium and small towns and vast rural markets. More than 3,500 purchasing points have been set up in wheat-producing areas of Henan; nearly 7,000 purchasing points have been set up in rice-producing areas of Hunan, Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Hubei. In addition, the simplification of grain purchasing procedures in various places has greatly saved the time for farmers in grain-producing areas to sell grain. Because the exchange ratio between new grain and some industrial products has narrowed this year, the number of draft animals, fertilizers, and farm tools purchased by farmers after selling new grain in the main wheat and rice producing areas of Henan and Dongting Lake has increased significantly compared to previous years. The amount of materials transported to the countryside for supply by state-owned commercial and cooperative departments in Central-South China is increasing month by month. In July, the peak season for early rice entering the market, the amount of various fertilizers supplied to farmers in Hunan Province increased by 20% compared to the monthly supply during the peak season for fertilizers in the first half of the year; the cooperatives in Jiangxi Province increased by 80%; and the state-owned commercial departments supplied 60% more daily necessities, cloth, and cotton yarn to various places in July than in the same period last year, and the supply of materials increased even more in August.

    中南区中稻大量上市购粮工作已积极展开
   【新华社武汉十四日电】我国主要产粮区的中南区，六月份以来小麦、早稻、中稻等农作物相继上市，由于中稻在中南粮食总产量中占极大比重，所以，目前中稻大量上市后，就使全区购粮工作进入了新的高潮。八月底以来，在湖南、广东、江西、湖北等水稻主要产区，每天上市的新谷已达五千万斤到六千万斤。洞庭湖滨和鄱阳湖滨的平原上，有的地区稻谷上市量已超过去年的最高纪录。由于广大农民踊跃出售新粮，自六月份新粮上市到八月底止，全区粮食部门和合作社收购小麦和稻谷的总数比去年同期增加了百分之三十七，其中小麦已完成年度收购计划的百分之八十四以上。八月份因早稻、中稻同时上市，全区收购的新谷比七月份增加了一倍半以上。
    中南区每年从六月河南的小麦上市起，便开始了新粮上市旺季；之后长江两岸各省的早稻、中稻、晚稻接踵上市，农民售粮时间一直延续到秋冬。今年各地农民出售新粮比往年稍早，为适应各地农民售粮需要，中南区国营粮食部门和合作社都扩大了收购力量，在中、小城镇和广大农村市场遍布购粮点，河南产麦区设置了收购点三千五百多个；湖南、广东、江西、湖北水稻产区设置了收购点近七千个；加以各地购粮手续简化，大大节省了粮产区农民的售粮时间。由于今年新粮和一部分工业品的交换比价缩小了，在河南和洞庭湖滨的麦米主要产区，农民出售新粮后购置耕畜、肥料、农具的数量比往年显著增加。中南各地国营商业、合作社部门运往农村供应的物资月月增加。在早稻上市最盛的七月份内，湖南省供应农民的各种肥料，比上半年供应肥料旺季每月的供应量增多二成；江西省合作社增多八成；国营商业部门在七月份供应各地的日用百货、布匹、棉纱也比去年同期增加六成以上，八月份供应的物资增加的就更多。
