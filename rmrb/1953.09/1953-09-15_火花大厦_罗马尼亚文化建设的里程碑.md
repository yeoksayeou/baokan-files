    The Scinteia House – A Milestone in Romanian Cultural Construction
    Romanian "Scinteia" Reporter Viktor Beldanu
    In 1931, in a damp and dark cellar on a street in the suburbs of Bucharest, a group of people were printing a small and thin newspaper under the dim light of an oil lamp—"Scinteia," the organ of the Central Committee of the Romanian Communist Party. Thus, the newspaper, which mobilized the people to overthrow the regime of oppression and exploitation and to fight for freedom and a happy life, was born underground.
    The path that the Romanian people have traveled from the oppressed dark past to the free and bright present is vividly reflected in the course of the newspaper "Scinteia," which is loved by the masses. This is the development from a damp and dark small house in the cellar to the magnificent building of the printing center in Bucharest—the "Yo. Vi. Stalin Scinteia House".
    I remember how, in 1949 and 1950, a group of the country's best architectural experts worked tirelessly day and night to formulate the architectural plan of this building. Their work was often personally led by the Party and Comrade Gheorghiu-Dej. The task given to the architects by the Party and the government was not easy: to embody in the new building the working people's deep desire for culture and a new socialist life. The "Scinteia House" must combine the excellent national traditions of Romanian architecture with the solemn and grand characteristics of the era of socialist construction, becoming a milestone of Romanian new culture and a true architectural work of art in future Bucharest.
    After months of hard work, and making full use of the rich experience of Soviet architecture, the architects completed this difficult and noble task. This design was praised by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party. In order to implement this plan, work began quickly.
    When we talk about the great work of planning and building this largest printing complex factory in Southeastern Europe, we cannot but thank the Soviet Union for its great assistance. From the valuable suggestions of the best Soviet architects, to the cranes and conveyor belts that greatly reduce manual labor; from the famous Stakhanovite bricklayer Kovalev teaching our bricklayers the Soviet rapid construction method, to the most modern printing machines and equipment manufactured in the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union helped build this printing complex building in every way. This is why the entire Romanian people warmly supported the decision of the Party and the government to name the "Scinteia House" after Stalin, the genius mentor of the working people and the great friend of Romania.
    The magnificent building of the "Scinteia House" stands in one of the most beautiful scenic areas of our capital, on the shore of Lake Herăstrău. Its towering long shadow is reflected in the mirror-like lake. Not far from the "Scinteia House" is the "Stalin Cultural Rest Park" blooming with various flowers.
    The huge scale of the "Scinteia House" can be seen from the fact that only from an airplane can the entire ten components of the already completed building be seen. These building parts constitute an architectural complex, decorated with arches and columns in accordance with the most outstanding styles of Romanian architecture from the 16th to 18th centuries. Now the construction workers are working to build the central part of this building. The steel frame has been erected to a height of one hundred meters. The huge central building will be the tallest building in our country, and it will be built entirely of white stone and based on a large pedestal of red granite. Above the eleventh floor of the building, a huge golden arrow pointing straight to the sky will be installed, symbolizing the people's desire for light and progress for many centuries.
    The working environment in the new building is completely different from those printing plants built under the bourgeois landlord regime. In the past, typesetting, imposition, and binding workers toiled for meager incomes year after year in narrow, crowded, poorly ventilated, and poorly lit rooms, and their health was severely damaged. Pneumonia and lead poisoning killed many printing workers every year. But now, in the "Scinteia House," everywhere you can feel the Party and the government's concern and care for the safety and health of the staff. All the printing workers in all the workshops work in spacious, well-ventilated, and well-lit halls. Green tiles are built up to the middle of the walls.
    The type casting workshop of the "Scinteia House" is in a hall with six-meter-high windows, which allow air and light to pass through unhindered, and is also equipped with strong automatic ventilation equipment.
    People who come to visit the "Scinteia House" are not only left with an unforgettable impression of the particularly superior working environment here, but also moved by the advanced Soviet technology that runs through every stage of the production process. Nearly five hundred machines representing the latest technology are the pride of the workers in this building.
    Here is the most modern reel-fed press with twelve rollers among all the printing presses in our country. On May 8, 1951, the first four rollers began printing "Scinteia" in the new house, and now all twelve rollers have been started. These excellent Soviet machines are 56 meters long and can print three million copies of newspapers every day. On the same floor, there are also lithographic presses and reel-fed book printing presses working. In one day, the various departments of the building can print 100,000 copies of books. Due to the start-up of the new reel-fed book printing machine, the cost of printing books has been saved, and our country has reduced the prices of literary and scientific books by 15% since January 1952.
    The binding department is in the four wings of the second floor of the building. In the past, the work of folding book pages was done by hand, but now it is done by new machines. In the general binding room, a giant Soviet "cover foil stamping machine" performs seven different tasks at the same time, replacing the labor of forty people.
    In one of the largest rooms of the building is the distribution department for newspapers and books. Special conveyors carry the newspapers from the outlet of the printing press to the packaging table. The female workers quickly pack them up and put them in a large cylinder, so the newspapers slide directly down this cylinder to the delivery truck. The distribution work was one of the most difficult tasks in the old printing factory, but in the "Scinteia House", it is now almost completely mechanized.
    Not only the printing house, but also the editorial departments of the central newspapers, especially the editorial department of "Scinteia", are also located in well-lit and spacious rooms. In the years of underground work, "Scinteia" was written in cellars or attics, but now the editors and staff of "Scinteia" can make full use of more than 120 spacious and comfortable rooms.
    During the construction of the building and after the partial start-up of the machines, many skilled cadres who have mastered the technology and are full of enthusiasm for their work have been trained. In the various departments of the building, there are now more than forty Stakhanovite workers and more than two hundred and fifty advanced workers working. Everyone in our country is familiar with the name of Bania Rong, the mechanical foreman who won the "Labor Medal" for his significant contribution to the installation of the reel-fed press. Now he is using his experienced eyes and high technical knowledge to operate this smoothly running excellent Soviet machine. At the same time, our people are also familiar with the name of Stakhanovite Silvia Musachesku. She used to be an unskilled worker in a printing factory in Bucharest who transported paper and swept the floor. Thanks to the party's training and her own efforts, she has now become a specialized female bookbinder who can complete two to three quotas every day. Thanks to the selfless efforts of the workers of the "Scinteia House", most of the various complete machines transported from the Soviet Union have now been started. The huge reel-fed press printed 460 million copies of newspapers last year. In the last quarter of last year alone, the machines in the various departments of the printing building printed more than 12 million books. This number exceeds the annual output of all printing factories during the former bourgeois landlord regime.
    After the establishment of the "Yo. Vi. Stalin Scinteia House", the Party and the government created a powerful tool for the cultural revolution to improve the cultural level of the masses of our people. While building a new happy life, the working people of our country are also making great strides towards a high level of culture. The cultural needs of our people are growing day by day. Now the daily circulation of our country's newspapers has reached five million copies, which greatly exceeds the circulation of newspapers before our country's liberation. The circulation of "Scinteia" alone has exceeded the total circulation of all newspapers and magazines in the past. The purpose of building the "Scinteia House" is to meet the increasing cultural needs of the masses of our people.
    In the suburbs of Bucharest, a magnificent palace—the printing complex factory "Yo. Vi. Stalin Scinteia House"—has been built in just two years like a myth. The working people of our country believe that this is a manifestation of the unshakable friendship between our country and the great Soviet Union, a symbol of the new life that is constantly prospering in our country, and also a milestone of the Romanian new culture with socialist content and national form.

    火花大厦——罗马尼亚文化建设的里程碑
    罗马尼亚“火花报”记者　维克多·别勒达努
    在一九三一年的时候，在布加勒斯特近郊一条街道的一个潮湿而阴暗的地窖里，一群人在一盏油灯的昏暗灯光下印刷着一种小而薄的报纸——“火花报”，罗马尼亚共产党中央的机关报为动员人民推翻压迫与剥削的政权，为争取自由和幸福生活而斗争的报纸，就这样在地下诞生了。
    罗马尼亚人民从被压迫的黑暗的过去到自由光辉的现在所经历的道路，生动地反映在被群众所热爱的报纸——“火花报”所经历的途程中。这就是从地窖里的潮湿阴暗的小屋子，发展到矗立在布加勒斯特的、具有优美外形的印刷中心——“约·维·斯大林火花大厦”的雄伟建筑物。
    我还记得，在一九四九年到一九五○年的时候，全国最优秀的一批建筑专家如何日夜不倦地为了制订这座大厦的建筑计划而工作着。他们的工作经常得到党和乔治乌—德治同志的亲自领导。党和政府给与建筑师们的任务并不是容易的：要在新的建筑物里体现出劳动人民对于文化和社会主义新生活的深切愿望。“火花大厦”须要把罗马尼亚建筑中优秀的民族传统和建设社会主义时代庄严伟大的特点结合起来，成为罗马尼亚新文化的里程碑，成为未来布加勒斯特的一个真正的建筑艺术品。
    经过了好几个月的辛劳工作，充分利用了苏联建筑学上的丰富经验，建筑家们把这一艰难而崇高的任务完成了。这一设计受到了罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会政治局的表扬。为了执行这个计划，很快就开始了工作。
    当我们谈到计划和建筑这个在东南欧最大的印刷综合工厂的伟大工作时，我们不能不感谢苏联的巨大的援助。从最优秀的苏联建筑师们的宝贵建议，一直到大大减轻人力劳动的起重机和输送带；从著名的斯大哈诺夫工作者泥瓦工郭瓦廖夫教给我们泥水工人的苏联快速建筑法，直到苏联制造的最现代化的印刷机器和设备，苏联以一切办法来帮助建筑这个印刷综合工厂大厦。这就是为什么全体罗马尼亚人民热烈地拥护党和政府决定以劳动人民的天才导师、罗马尼亚的伟大朋友斯大林的名字来命名“火花大厦”的原故。
    “火花大厦”的宏伟建筑矗立在我国首都最美丽的一个风景区——赫拉斯特劳湖畔。在明镜般的湖水里倒映着它的高耸的长影。离“火花大厦”不远，就是盛开着各种鲜花的“斯大林文化休息公园”。
    “火花大厦”的巨大规模可以从这一个事实上看出来：即它的已经落成的整个建筑物的十个组成部分，只有在飞机上才能全部看到。这些建筑部分构成一个建筑的综合体，它按照十六到十八世纪罗马尼亚建筑上最出色的样式，用圆拱和圆柱装饰起来。现在建筑工人们正在为建立这个建筑物的中心部分而工作着。钢骨已架设到一百公尺的高空。巨大的中心大楼将是我国最高的建筑物，它将全部用白石砌成并奠基在红色花冈石的大台基上面。在大厦的第十一层楼之上，将安装一个直指云霄的巨大金箭，它象征着许多世纪以来人民渴望走向光明与进步的理想。
    新的大厦里的工作环境，和在资产阶级地主政权下所盖的那些印刷厂房迥然不同。从前的排字、拼版和装订工人们在狭窄、拥挤、空气恶浊和光线不足的屋子里，为了微薄的收入而经年累月地劳苦工作，他们的健康受到严重的损害。肺炎和铅中毒每年都要害掉许多印刷工人的性命。但是现在，在“火花大厦”里，处处都可以感觉到党和政府对于工作人员的安全与健康的关怀与照顾。所有车间里的印刷工人都在宽敞、空气流通和光线充足的大厅里工作。绿色的磁砖一直砌到墙壁的中部。
    “火花大厦”的铸字车间是在装有六公尺高的窗子的大厅里，这些窗子可以使空气和光线直通无阻，而且还装有强力的自动通风设备。
    来到“火花大厦”参观的人们，不仅对这里特别优越的工作环境留下难忘的印象，而且还要为贯串在生产过程每一阶段中的苏联先进技术而受到感动。表现着最新技术的近五百部机器，是这座大厦里的工人们的骄傲。
    这里有我国所有印刷机中最新式的具有十二个滚子的卷筒机。一九五一年五月八日，最初的四个滚子开始在新房子里印刷“火花报”，而现在十二个滚子已全部开动。这些出色的苏联机器长达五十六公尺，每天能印三百万份报纸。在同一层楼里，还有平版机和印书用的卷筒机在工作。在一天之内，大厦的各部门能够印出十万册书籍。由于新式的卷筒印书机的开工节省了印书的成本，我国已从一九五二年一月起把文艺和科学书籍的价格减低了百分之十五。
    装订部在大厦第二层楼的四翼。以前折摺书页的工作是用手工来做的，现在则由新机器来进行。在总装订室里，一台巨型的苏联“封面烫字机”同时进行着七种不同的工作，它代替了四十个人的劳动。
    在大厦的一个最大的房间里，是报刊和书籍的发行部门。特殊的传送机把报纸从印刷机的出口带到包装台。女工们很快地把它们打包起来，放进一个大圆筒内，于是报纸就顺着这个筒子直接滑到运货汽车上去。发行工作本是旧时印刷厂里的最困难的工作之一，但在“火花大厦”内，现在也几乎完全机械化了。
    不仅是印刷所这样，而且中央级报纸的编辑部，特别是“火花报”的编辑部，也是设在光线充足的宽敞的房间里。在地下工作的年代中，“火花报”是在地窖里或阁楼上编写的，但现在“火花报”的编辑和工作人员们却可以充分利用一百二十多个宽敞舒适的房间。
    在大厦的兴建过程中和部分机器开动以后，已培养出许多掌握技术并对自己的工作充满热情的熟练干部。在大厦的各个部门里，现在有四十多个斯大哈诺夫工作者，二百五十多个先进工作者在工作着。我国每个人都熟悉那位由于对安装卷筒机的工作有重大贡献而荣获“劳动勋章”的机械领班巴尼亚·荣的名字。现在他正在用他那双有经验的眼睛和高度的技术知识，操作着这个平稳开动着的出色的苏联机器。同时，我国人民也都熟悉斯大哈诺夫工作者西尔维亚·慕沙切斯古的名字，她从前是在布加勒斯特一家印刷厂里运纸、扫地的一个没有技术的工人，由于党的培养和自己的努力，她现在已成为掌握专门技术，每天能完成两个到三个定额的订书女工。由于“火花大厦”工人们的忘我努力，从苏联运来的各种完备机器现在绝大部分都已开工了。巨大的卷筒机已在去年印出了四亿六千万份报纸。仅仅在去年的最后一季内，印刷大厦的各部机器就印出了一千二百多万册书籍。这个数字超过从前资产阶级地主政权统治时期所有印刷厂的全年生产量。  
    “约·维·斯大林火花大厦”建立后，党和政府就为提高我国人民群众文化水平的文化革命事业创造了一个有力的工具。我国劳动人民在建设新的幸福生活的同时，也正在向高度的文化水平大踏步前进。我国人民的文化需求正在与日俱增。现在我国报纸的每日发行数量已经达到了五百万份，这个数字已大大地超过了我国解放以前的报纸发行数量。单是“火花报”的发行数额就已超过了过去所有报纸杂志的发行总额。“火花大厦”兴建的目的就是为了适应我国人民群众的日益增长的文化需求。
    在布加勒斯特的近郊，短短的两年中就像神话一般地建立起了一座辉煌的宫殿——印刷综合工厂“约·维·斯大林火花大厦”。我国劳动人民认为这是我国与伟大苏联的不可动摇的友谊的表现，是在我国不断繁荣着的新生活的象征，同时也认为这是具有社会主义内容和民族形式的罗马尼亚新文化的里程碑。（附图片）
