    The Second National Congress of the China New Democratic Youth League unanimously passed the resolution to change the name of "China Children's Team" to "Young Pioneers of China" in order to more accurately reflect the nature and tasks of the Children's Team and to meet the wishes of the children.

    "Pioneer" is someone who opens up roads, someone who walks ahead for the benefit of the people. There are many famous scientists, philosophers, writers, artists, and many people's heroes in human history. In order to pursue truth and strive for the freedom and happiness of mankind, they bravely and fearlessly carried out tremendous creative labor and opened up the road for human progress. They are pioneers. The great Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin opened up the road for the cause of the liberation of the working people. They are the greatest communist pioneers. Our beloved leader Chairman Mao and his comrades led the people of our country to liberation and are building a new life. They are also great communist pioneers. On all fronts of our motherland, there are many combat heroes, labor models, advanced workers, and many Communist Party members and Youth League members. They take the lead in advocating and are not afraid of difficulties, dedicating everything they have to the cause of defending and building the motherland. They are pioneers in building a new life.

    Applying the educationally meaningful title of "Pioneer" to children's organizations is mainly to educate children to learn from the examples of the pioneers, inherit their cause, and bravely advance along the road opened up for us by the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao and his comrades! Youth League organizations and instructors at all levels should take advantage of this name change to conduct an education for the Young Pioneers and the vast number of children, educating them to learn from the cause of the great pioneers, as well as their lives and struggles; encourage the members to study hard, exercise, abide by discipline, and unite in friendship in order to be worthy of the glorious title of Young Pioneers, and to be truly capable of undertaking the cause of pioneers in the future, prepare to strive for the cause of building the motherland, and for the realization of the great ideals of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao!

    Changing the name of "China Children's Team" to "Young Pioneers of China" does not change the nature and tasks of the team. The Young Pioneers of China is still a broad-based organization of children themselves. This organization unites and educates children in learning and various collective activities, and cultivates them to become a new generation that loves the motherland, loves the people, loves labor, loves science, and cherishes public property, and is healthy, lively, brave, and honest. Youth League committees at all levels must pay attention to prevent and correct misunderstandings about the nature of the team that may be caused by the name change, and especially prevent and correct tendencies such as demanding too much from children without starting from education, and raising the requirements for children to join the team.

    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会
    关于“中国少年儿童队”改名为“中国少年先锋队”的说明
    ——一九五三年八月二十一日
    中国新民主主义青年团第二次全国代表大会，为了更确切地反映少年儿童队的性质、任务和适应少年儿童们的愿望，一致通过了把“中国少年儿童队”改名为“中国少年先锋队”。
    “先锋”是开辟道路的人，是为了人民的利益走在前面的人。人类历史上有许多著名的科学家、哲学家、文学家、艺术家以及许多的人民英雄，他们为了追求真理和争取人类的自由幸福，勇敢地、不怕困难地进行了巨大的创造性的劳动，开辟了人类前进的道路，他们是先锋。伟大的马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林为劳动人民的解放事业开辟了道路，他们是最伟大的共产主义先锋。我们敬爱的领袖毛主席和他的战友们，领导我国人民获得了解放，建设着新生活，他们也是伟大的共产主义先锋。在我们祖国的各个战线上，有着许多战斗英雄、劳动模范、先进工作者，有着许多共产党员、青年团员，他们带头倡导，不怕困难，把自己的一切贡献给保卫祖国和建设祖国的事业，他们是建设新生活的先锋。
    以“先锋”这样一个富于教育意义的称号，加之于少年儿童的组织，主要是教育儿童学习先锋们的榜样，继承他们的事业，沿着中国共产党和毛主席及其战友们为我们开辟的道路勇敢前进！各级青年团的组织和辅导员们应该通过这次改名，普遍地对少年先锋队员和广大少年儿童进行一次教育，教育他们学习伟大先锋们的事业，以及他们的生活和斗争事迹；鼓励队员们为了无愧于少年先锋队员的光荣称号，为了在将来真正能担当起先锋者的事业，要好好学习，锻炼身体，遵守纪律，团结友爱，准备为建设祖国的事业，为实现中国共产党和毛主席的伟大理想而奋斗！
    “中国少年儿童队”改名为“中国少年先锋队”，并没有改变队的性质和任务，中国少年先锋队仍然是广泛性的少年儿童自己的组织，这个组织在学习和各种集体活动中，团结和教育少年儿童，培养他们成为爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学、爱护公共财物，健壮、活泼、勇敢、诚实的新的一代。各级团委必须注意防止和纠正由于改名而可能引起的对队的性质的误解，特别要防止和纠正不从教育出发，过高地要求儿童，以及提高儿童入队条件等偏向。
