    Grain Departments and Cooperatives Closely Cooperate
    Increased Rice Procurement in Huanggang Prefecture, Hubei
    The state-owned grain departments and cooperatives in Huanggang Prefecture, Hubei Province, have closely cooperated in procuring rice. As of September 9th, they had procured 30 million jin of mid-season rice, a twofold increase compared to the same period last year.
    This year, under the leadership of the Party Committee and the government, state-owned grain departments and cooperatives in various parts of Huanggang Prefecture started by correcting their attitudes and reviewing their work. They unified their understanding through criticism and self-criticism, significantly improving their relationship. For example, when the state-owned grain department and cooperative in Huangmei County signed the rice procurement contract last year, they argued for sixteen days before reluctantly reaching an agreement. This year, they smoothly signed the contract in just one and a half days. To do a good job in rice procurement, both sides generally take the initiative to cooperate. For instance, when the cooperative in Xishui County lacked grain storage, the Grain Bureau automatically lent six granaries to solve part of the problem. In some places, the grain managed by the cooperatives exceeded the contractually stipulated amount by six or seven times, but there were no instances of suspending procurement due to warehouse difficulties as happened last year. Cadres of the cooperatives said: Problems and difficulties can be solved with effort, and procurement work must not be affected. In Shengli County, the state-owned grain department initially failed to rely on the cooperatives effectively during the early wheat procurement period, controlling only a little over 40% of the wheat on the market. Later, it resolutely relied on the cooperatives and provided them with various forms of assistance, resulting in a surge in wheat procurement to over 90% of the market supply. In addition, cooperatives in various parts of Huanggang Prefecture paid special attention to supply work and improved procurement methods this year, so the overall rice procurement work in the region has progressed smoothly. Currently, under the leadership of the county Finance and Economics Committee, state-owned grain departments and cooperatives in major grain-producing counties have established unified procurement offices to oversee procurement work and organize work teams to inspect work at various procurement points in turn, and solve problems.
    Some shortcomings still exist in rice procurement work in some areas. First, market management work is not done well. Some counties are more diligent in managing larger market towns such as county seats, but have relaxed management of primary markets. Many speculators and private merchants disguised as farmers and other means, infiltrated rural areas to disrupt the market and engage in panic buying, affecting national procurement work. Second, they have not actively sought ways to transport the grain as it is procured. Counties such as Xinzhou have not promptly found ways to transport grain from grassroots procurement points, resulting in excessive grain storage at grassroots procurement points and scattered storage everywhere. Some temporary warehouses have thin walls and leaky roofs, causing damage to stored grain. Accidents involving temporary warehouses collapsing due to the weight of the grain have occurred in Huangmei and Huanggang counties. In some places, stored grain has been infested with insects. Currently, Party committees and governments in various counties have begun to address these issues. (Wang Benzhi)

    粮食部门和合作社密切配合
    湖北黄冈专区稻谷收购量增加
    湖北省黄冈专区国营粮食部门和合作社密切配合收购稻谷，截至九月九日止，已收进中稻三千万斤，比去年同时期收购数量增加一倍。
    今年黄冈专区各地国营粮食部门和合作社在党委和政府领导下，从端正态度、检查工作着手，运用批评与自我批评统一了认识，双方关系有很大改善。如黄梅县国营粮食部门和合作社去年签订稻谷收购合同时，争执了十六天才勉强订好，今年只用了一天半时间便顺利地签订了合同。为了做好收购稻谷工作，双方一般都能主动配合。如浠水县合作社粮仓不足，粮食局自动借给六个粮仓，解决了一部分问题。有的地方合作社代管粮食已经超过合同规定数六、七倍，也没有发生像去年那样因仓库困难而停收的现象。合作社的干部说：有问题和困难可以想办法解决，不能让收购工作受到影响。胜利县国营粮食部门今年收麦初期，由于没有很好地依靠合作社进行收购工作，只掌握了上市小麦的百分之四十多；后来坚决依靠合作社，对合作社多方扶助，结果收购小麦数量激增到上市量的百分之九十以上。另外，黄冈专区各地合作社今年特别注意了供应工作，并改进了收购方法，所以全区稻谷收购工作进展比较顺利。目前，各主要产粮县国营粮食部门和合作社都在县财政经济委员会领导下，成立了统一收购办公室，掌握收购工作，并组织工作组轮流到各收购点检查工作，解决问题。
    有些地区收购稻谷工作还存在一些缺点。首先是市场管理工作做得不好。有些县对城关等较大集镇管理比较认真，但放松了对初级市场的管理。不少投机私商用化装为农民等办法深入农村扰乱市场，进行抢购，影响了国家收购工作。其次是没有积极设法随收随运。新洲等县没有及时设法将基层收购点的粮食运走，基层收购点存粮过多，只好到处散存。有些临时仓库砖薄顶漏，使存粮受到损失。黄梅、黄冈两县已先后发生临时仓库被粮食挤倒的事故。有的地方存粮已被虫蚀。目前，各县党委和政府已着手解决这些问题。　　（王本直）
