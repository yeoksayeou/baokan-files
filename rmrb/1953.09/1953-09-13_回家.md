    Returning Home
    Zhu Zunying

    Editor's Note: Zhu Zunying is a student at the Beijing Normal University Affiliated Girls' Middle School. After the sacrifice of the Volunteer Army’s First-Class People's Hero, Yang Lian'di, she wrote a letter to the hero's father, Yang Yupu, asking to be his daughter. Yang Yupu quickly replied, agreeing to her request. Since then, they have continuously corresponded and exchanged gifts. This article was written by Zhu Zunying after her first personal visit to the home of martyr Yang Lian'di to express her condolences.

    On July 12th, I braved the rain to go to Beicang Village in the suburbs of Tianjin, where the home of hero Yang Lian'di is located – no, it is also my home.

    The closer I got to the village, the faster my heart beat. This was the first time I was returning home! After entering the village, I followed the directions Yang Uncle had written in his letter not long ago. From afar, I spotted the few brand-new houses at the north end of the village. This was my home. As luck would have it, this day was the day the family moved into their new house, and people helping with the move were constantly going in and out of that new, gray gate.

    I squeezed through the crowd, and a robust old man came towards me. I knew at once that he must be Uncle Yang. I quickly took two steps forward and couldn't help but call out, "Uncle!" He widened his eyes, stared intently, and suddenly smiled, saying loudly, "Oh! Aren't you Zunying!" His shout was heard by the whole family, and they ran out from various houses. Auntie was at the very front. I quickly ran over, took her hand, and asked, "Auntie, do you recognize me?" She smiled and said, "How could I not recognize you! Good girl, you didn't pick a good day to come, with such heavy rain. Come inside and rest."

    Before I had time to talk to anyone else, Auntie pulled me into the house. Lian'di's sister-in-law also came in, leaning against me, and said affectionately:
  "Cousin, you're finally back. We've been wanting to see you for a long time! Come, sit inside on the kang!" As she spoke, she pushed me onto the kang. I originally didn't know how to sit cross-legged, but seeing my sister-in-law's warmth, I didn't want to refuse.

    The adults were all busy moving or cooking, and only Auntie, me, and a few children were left in the room. Auntie introduced the children's names to me one by one. Changlin is Lian'di's eldest child, only ten years old this year. He studies at the village's central primary school and is excellent, always in the top five. Changlin also has two younger sisters, the older one is called Daping, and the younger one is called Erru. They are both very sturdy. Erru looks a lot like Lian'di, with a round face, but she is a bit shy and hides when she sees people. When I went to take her hand, she put her little hands straight behind her back. Auntie said, "Erru, didn't you always say you wanted to go to Beijing to see the cousin who bought you the patterned ball for the New Year? Your cousin is here, why don't you dare to speak!" Hearing her grandmother's words, her little eyes stared at me with a smile. Jiying is Lian'di's youngest child. He was born after Lian'di's sacrifice. To commemorate Lian'di, he was named Jiying. Everyone in the family loves him very much, especially Auntie. They all hope that when he grows up, he can inherit the cause of his heroic father.

    Lunch was ready: cold, hot, meat, vegetarian, large plates, and small bowls filled the table. Looking at these things, I said to Uncle, "Uncle, this is too wasteful..." Before Uncle could speak, Comrade Jin from the district, who was here helping with the move, rushed to explain, "Don't worry, your uncle just harvested new wheat, he has to treat his daughter who's returning home for the first time!" What he said made everyone laugh.

    Towards evening, the people helping with the move gradually dispersed, and I finally took a closer look at this new residence. The new house has a total of six rooms, facing north and south, three rooms connected to each other, just like the houses in the government offices. Coupled with the red courtyard walls and gray gate, it looks particularly fresh and beautiful. The westernmost room is where the second brother, Liankui (Yang Lian'di's second younger brother), and his wife live. Next to it is the kitchen, and then Lian'di's sister-in-law's room. The three rooms on the east side, the easternmost one, is where Uncle and Auntie live, which is where we had lunch. The middle room has not yet been furnished and looks like it will be used as a guest room. The room to the west is a display room. In the center of the wall hangs the portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, Chairman Mao, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, with Lian'di's portrait hanging below, surrounded by black gauze. Directly opposite the door is a square table with several glass boxes lined with red satin, inside which are Lian'di's pre-death Height Climbing Hero medal, the commemorative medal of the National Combat Heroes and Labor Model Representative Conference, and the military medal awarded to him by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea... The surrounding walls are also covered with Yang Lian'di's pre-death award certificates, merit reports, photos of heroic deeds... Seeing these, it's like reliving the hero's epic, making you inevitably moved. Here, there are also glorious plaques and flags sent from all over the country, the soldiers' oaths, the workers' guarantees, enthusiastic letters of condolence from students, and photos of them asking to be his children, it's truly one person's meritorious service brings glory to the whole family!

    The rain was still pattering down. The courtyard was filled with the sounds of chickens and ducks, the ducks were frolicking in the puddles on the ground, and the chickens were pacing back and forth looking for food. Sometimes they would stretch their necks and shake off the rainwater on their bodies. Over there, a donkey was eating fodder in the pen, and you could hear the rustling chewing sounds. This donkey, Uncle mentioned in his letters to me more than once. It was bought with the help of the People's Government after Lian'di's sacrifice, it's grown plump and strong, one is truly worth one. Later, the People's Government also provided a loan to buy a rubber-wheeled cart, and the second brother drove the cart to haul goods. These days, because of the rain, the livestock and the cart are resting at home.

    Dinner was another table full: pancakes, stir-fried vegetables, rice porridge...

    After dinner, the sisters-in-law went to coax the children to sleep, and I had a hearty chat with Uncle and Auntie again. The smile never left Uncle's face, he loved to talk about the past and even more about the present. Talking about the situation of participating in the fourth Tianjin Municipal People's Congress, he said: Everyone elected me to the presidium and sat with the mayor, not to mention, there were several comrades specifically helping me when going up and down the elevator. I said to them: "Comrades, don't do this, I still carry a big hoe to work in the fields at home!" Here, it seemed like he couldn't express his feelings, and after half a day, he added a sentence: "Really, the Communist Party, Chairman Mao..."

    Auntie always loves to chat about family matters. One thing she says is how good Lian'di's sister-in-law is, how well the sisters-in-law get along, how clever Liankui is...

    Then, she talked about Lian'di. She said: "Your older brother, he had that energy since he was a child, climbing poles and trees, afraid of nothing. But, he didn't have any shortage of starving days..." Mentioning the past, tears welled up in Auntie's eyes, and my eyes couldn't help but moisten. Seeing that I was sad, she quickly changed the subject: "You don't know, the first time I heard that your Lian'di became a 'Height Climbing Hero' and went to Beijing to see Chairman Mao, the joy of the whole family. After going to Korea, the merit reports came one after another, and the villagers all said that your uncle had made it, having a heroic son, the suffering hadn't been in vain! He himself had energy in his work, he and your third brother Liansheng went to the fields before dawn in the morning, and always didn't come back until it was almost time to light the lamps in the evening. Even now, he's still like this. He often says: 'If I wasn't old, I would have run to Korea to get to work!'"

    Talking and talking, it was past ten o'clock. The joy of returning home made me forget my fatigue. Lying in bed, my mind was still flashing with everything I had seen today. I felt that I was honored to be the daughter of such a heroic family!

    回家
    朱尊英
    编者按：朱尊英是北京师范大学附属女子中学的学生。志愿军一级人民英雄杨连第烈士牺牲后，她给英雄的父亲杨玉璞写信，要求做他的女儿，杨玉璞很快回信答应了。从此，他们就不断通信，并相互赠送礼品。本文是朱尊英第一次亲自到杨连第烈士家中慰问后写的。
    七月十二日，我冒着雨到天津市郊的北仓村去，那里有英雄杨连第烈士的家——不，也是我的家。
    越走近村子，我的心越跳得厉害，这还是第一次回家呀！进了村子，我照着不久前杨大伯写信告诉我的地方走去，老远，就望到村北头那几间崭新的房子，这就是我的家了。真巧，这天正是家里迁入新居的日子，帮助搬家的人们，不停地从那个新的灰色大门里进进出出。
    我从人群中挤进去，一个身体健壮的老人迎面走来，一看就知道他准是杨大伯。我紧着向前迈了两步，不由得叫道：“大伯！”他睁大了眼，凝视着，突然笑起来，大声说：“噢！你不是尊英！”他这一叫，被全家人都听到了，他们从各个房子里跑出来，走在最前面的是大娘。我忙跑过去，拉住她的手问：“大娘，认得我是谁不？”她一边笑一边说：“咳，那能不认得！好闺女，来时也不选个好日子，下着这么大雨，快进去歇歇。”
    还没来得及和别人说话，大娘就拉我到房子里去。连第嫂子也跟了进来，靠着我，亲热地说道：
  “姑姑，你可回来了，俺们早就想着看你呢！快往炕里头坐吧！”说着，她就把我往炕上推。我本来不会盘腿坐，可是看到嫂子那股亲切劲儿，也不好拒绝了。
    大人都去忙着搬家或做饭了，屋子里只剩下大娘、我和几个孩子。大娘把孩子的名字都一一介绍给我。长林是连第哥最大的孩子，今年才十岁，在村里的中心小学读书，学得顶呱呱，总在前五名。长林还有两个妹妹，大的叫大萍，小的叫二茹，长得都挺结实，二茹的样子很像连第哥，圆呼呼的脸，就是有点怕生，见人就躲。我去拉她的手时，她把两只小手直往后背。大娘说：“二茹，你不是常说要到北京去看看过年时给你买花皮球的那个姑姑吗？姑姑来了，怎么又不敢说话啦！”她听着奶奶的话，两只小眼睛直盯着我笑。继英是连第哥最小的孩子，他在连第哥牺牲后才出生。为了纪念连第哥，把他取名继英。一家人都很疼他，大娘疼得更厉害。都希望他大了能继承英雄父亲的事业。
    午饭做好了：凉的、热的、荤的、素的、大盘小碗的摆了一桌子。我瞧着这些东西，对大伯说：“大伯，这可太浪费了……”大伯还没开口，在这里帮助搬家的区上的靳同志就抢着解释道：“不怕，你大伯才收下新麦子，还不招待招待你这第一次回家的闺女！”他说得大家都大笑起来。
    临到傍晚，帮助搬家的人渐渐散去，我才细看了一下这所新居。新房子一共六间，坐北朝南，三间三间相通，和机关里的房子一模样儿。再加上红色院墙和灰色大门的衬托，显得格外清新好看。最西边那间房子是二哥连奎（杨连第烈士的二弟）和二嫂住的，再过来是灶房，紧接着的一间就是连第嫂子的房子了。东边的那三间，最东的一间是大伯、大娘住的，就是我们中午吃饭的地方。中间的一间还没布置好，看样子是做客房的。靠西的一间是陈列室。房子正中间的墙上挂着马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林、毛主席和朱总司令的像，连第哥的遗像也挂在下边，像的周围还围着黑纱。正对门放有一张方桌，上面摆着几个衬有红缎子的玻璃盒，里面放着连第哥生前获得的登高英雄奖章，全国战斗英雄、劳动模范代表会议的纪念章、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国颁发给他的军功章……。屋子的周围还挂满了杨连第烈士生前所获得的奖状、立功的喜报、英雄事迹的照片……。看到了这些，就像重温了一遍英雄的史诗一样，使你不能不受感动。这里，还陈列着从全国各地送来的光荣匾、光荣旗、战士的誓言、工人的保证、学生们充满热情的慰问信和他们要求做儿女的照片，真是一人立功，全家光荣啊！
    雨还在滴滴嗒嗒地下着。院子里不时传来小鸡和鸭子的叫声，鸭子在尽情地嬉戏着地下的积水，小鸡在踱来踱去地觅寻食物，有时它们就伸长了脖子，抖擞一下身上的雨水。那边，一匹驴子在圈棚里吃着草料，还可以听得出沙沙的咀嚼声。这匹驴子，大伯在给我的信上不止一次地说过。这是连第哥牺牲后，人民政府帮助买的，长得膘肥体壮，一个真顶一个用。后来，人民政府又贷款给买了一辆胶轮大车，二哥就赶着大车去拉脚。这几天下雨，牲口、大车都在家歇着哩。
    晚饭又是一桌子：烙饼、炒菜，大米稀饭……。
    晚饭后，嫂子们都去哄孩子睡觉了，我又和大伯、大娘畅谈起来。大伯的脸上就没断过笑，爱谈过去，更爱谈现在。谈到参加天津市第四届各界人民代表会议的情形时，他说：大伙选我当了主席团，和市长他们坐在一起，这还不说，上下电梯时，还专有几个同志扶着我。我对他们说：“同志，别这样，我在家里还扛着大锄头下地干活呢！”这里，看样子他好像没办法表达自己的心情了，半天才加上一句：“真是，共产党，毛主席……。”
    大娘总爱扯家常。一说就是连第嫂子如何好呀，妯娌们如何合得来呀，连奎哥的心眼儿如何灵呀……。
    接着，她又谈起了连第哥。她说：“你大哥呀，从小就有那股劲儿，爬杆上树的，什么都不怕。可是，挨饿的日子也没少过……。”一提到过去，大娘的眼里便涌出了泪水，我的眼睛也情不自禁地润湿了。她看到我在难过，很快就转了话题：“你不知道呀，头一次听说你连第哥当了‘登高英雄’，还到北京见了毛主席时，全家人的那个欢乐样儿。到朝鲜以后，立功喜报又是一个接一个的，乡亲们都说你大伯熬出头了，有了个英雄的儿子，罪总算没白受！他自己干活也有了劲儿，早晨天还不亮，他和你三哥连生就下地去了，晚上总要到快上灯的时候才回来。就是现在，他还是这样。他常说：‘要不是我岁数大了，早跑到朝鲜去干起来了！’”
    谈着谈着，十点多了。回家的喜悦使我忘记了疲劳。倒在床上，脑子里还闪烁着今天所看到的一切。我觉得我能够做这样一个英雄家庭的女儿，真是光荣！
