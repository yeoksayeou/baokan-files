Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 11th. The US side transferred the first group of 904 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war, who were not directly repatriated, to the custody of Indian troops of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on the 11th. Reporters from the Korean and Chinese sides were not allowed to enter the camp where the Indian troops were guarding the prisoners of war until 1:30 pm on the same day. The obstruction by the US military authorities prevented the Korean and Chinese reporters from going to interview in the morning, and made it impossible to get a true report of yesterday—the first day's transfer situation.

From these prisoners of war, who were touted by the US propaganda machine as "refusing repatriation," the US military's crimes of maltreatment and persecution of prisoners of war were further exposed. Most of them were sallow and emaciated, wearing tattered pants with the letters P.W. (Prisoner of War) written on them, and ill-fitting, rotten boots. On their backs, they carried small "bedrolls" wrapped in tattered blankets. Only the short-sleeved undershirts they wore were new. From the Kuomintang party emblem printed on them, it can be seen that they were the "comfort items" brought to them half a month ago by Chiang Kai-shek bandit secret service chief Fang Zhi. Obviously, they were ordered to keep this undershirt until today to put it on. Many insulting words were tattooed on their bare arms. When they were led into the camp and took off their undershirts to be inspected by the Indian guard troops, the Chiang bandit flags and party emblems tattooed on their chests and backs were exposed to everyone.

The observation representatives dispatched by the Korean and Chinese sides observed the handover work of the Indian troops outside the barbed wire fence. They wore conspicuous badges with the words "Chinese People's Volunteer Army" in black characters on a white background with a bright red border. They watched each prisoner of war passing in front of them with great concern and sympathy. Although these prisoners of war had been handed over to the Indian troops for custody, it was very obvious from their faces that their fear had not been eliminated. When they were led into the camp one by one by the Indian guard troops, many of them dared not look directly, and after they entered the camp and sat down, many of them turned their faces and looked at the Volunteer Army personnel, whom they had not seen for two years, from a distance. A very few fat people shouted a few insulting slogans as if they were performing, but it was lonely and did not receive a response.

    首批不直接遣返的我志愿军被俘人员
    移交中立国遣返委员会印度部队看管
   【新华社开城十一日电】美方十一日把首批不直接遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员九百零四名移交给中立国遣返委员会印度部队看管。朝中方面的新闻记者直到当天下午一时半才被允许进入印度部队看管战俘的营地。由于美军当局的阻挠，使朝中记者不能在上午前往采访；并使得昨天——第一天的移交情况不能得到真实的报道。
    从这些被美方宣传机器称作“拒绝遣返”的战俘身上，进一步地暴露了美军虐待和迫害战俘的罪行。他们大都面黄肌瘦，下身穿着破旧的写着P·W·（战俘）字母的裤子，脚上穿着大得不称的烂靴子，背上背着一条破毯子裹成的小“铺盖卷”。只有上身穿着的一件短袖汗衫是新的。从上面印着的国民党党徽可以看出，那就是半个月以前蒋匪特务头子方治带给他们的“慰问品”。显然，这件汗衫被命令留下来直到今天才把它穿上。每个人赤裸的两条手臂上刺着许多侮辱性的字句，当他们被带进营场后脱去汗衫，受印度看管部队检查时，他们胸前背后被刺上的蒋匪旗子及党徽等都无遮蔽地暴露在人们面前。
    朝中方面派遣的观察代表在铁丝网外观察印度部队的接收工作。他们在胸前佩戴着鲜明的红边白底黑字的“中国人民志愿军”胸章，他们以十分关切和同情的目光注视着每个被俘人员从他们面前走过。这些被俘人员虽然已交给印度部队看管，但从他们的脸上很显然可以看出，他们的恐怖情绪并未消除。当他们一个个被印度看管部队架着走进营场去的时候，许多人都不敢正眼观看，而在他们进入营场坐下以后，许多人都转过脸来远远地望着两年不见的志愿军人员。极少数吃得胖胖的人好像表演似地喊出了几句辱骂的口号，但是它却孤单地没有得到回应。
