Southwestern Border Mountain Areas Gradually Change Slash-and-Burn Farming Habits
    Agricultural Production Potential Initially Developed
    Overcoming Natural Disasters and Animal Pests, This Year's Spring and Summer Crops Generally Increased
    The Southwest is mostly mountainous. Due to the cruel rule of successive reactionary factions, farmers' production is extremely backward. To this day, many places still use slash-and-burn farming methods, planting extensively but harvesting little.

    In order to transform and develop agricultural production in mountainous areas, Party committees and governments at all levels have strengthened leadership over production in mountainous areas and carried out reforms of production tools. The Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued instructions to Party committees at all levels in June this year on leading production in mountainous areas. Yunnan Province has formulated a five-year plan for transforming production in mountainous areas, and "Committees for Improving Production in Mountainous Areas" have been established from the province to the county level to specifically lead production in mountainous areas. Sichuan Province has also conducted key investigations. Zhang Yuhuan, Secretary of the Zhenyuan Prefectural Committee of Guizhou Province, personally led a working group to go deep into the mountainous areas to grasp key points, absorb and create experience, and guide general production in mountainous areas. At present, various places have basically overcome the tendency of "only valuing the interior and not valuing the border areas" and reversed the erroneous thinking of grassroots cadres who are not content with working in mountainous areas and believe there is no future there.

    In order to support production in mountainous areas and help farmers overcome difficulties in developing production, the Southwest Financial and Economic Committee issued 40 billion yuan worth of free agricultural implements this year to help people in mountainous areas reform production tools and replace wooden primitive production tools with iron ones. In Taijiang, Lushan and other 11 counties in Guizhou Province alone, 100,500 pieces of large and small agricultural tools were distributed. Generally, each county sent working groups deep into the mountainous areas to publicize policies and distribute relief grain and loans. Localities also organized primary market material exchanges. Guizhou Province held more than 200 small-scale material exchange meetings in mountainous areas inhabited by various ethnic minorities, selling more than 18 billion yuan worth of local and special products. After selling their local and special products, farmers in mountainous areas immediately purchased a large number of means of production.

    Wild animals are a great hazard to production in mountainous areas. High mountain areas in Yunnan, Guizhou, and Xikang have suffered from animal pests for years. In Qingchuan County, Sichuan Province, there are as many as 20 kinds of wild animals that endanger people, livestock, and crops, and there are also eight kinds of harmful birds. The loss of crops in the county's 15 townships due to wild animals reaches 40% to 60%. The masses call it "half taken by heaven, half taken by earth." In order to prevent and eliminate animal pests, many areas have helped the masses solve the difficulties of gunpowder and guns needed for hunting and mobilized the masses to actively hunt and kill. Yunnan Province allocated more than 600 million yuan in hunting loans and more than 30,000 rounds of ammunition in December last year. For example, in Douzui Village, Fourth District, Luliang County, because 18 wild boars that often harmed crops were killed, the potato production this year doubled.

    Droughts and floods in mountainous areas are also more serious than in flat areas. Many areas either "drought" or "flood," seriously affecting production. Therefore, building water conservancy projects to prevent drought and flood and irrigate fields is of great significance for developing production in mountainous areas. Mountainous areas in Xuanwei, Mengzi, Yuxi and other counties in Yunnan Province have recently convened district and township representative meetings to summarize experience in flood prevention and drought resistance and to inspect the construction of water conservancy projects. Shangyao Township, Xuanwei County, mobilized more than 600 farmers to build three new water diversion ditches, blocking mountain water into dams and ponds, preventing floods, and storing water for spring plowing next year. As of June this year, Guizhou Province has built and renovated more than 3,000 water conservancy projects in mountainous areas, guaranteeing the irrigation of more than 156,600 mu of paddy fields.

    Because farmers in mountainous areas have reduced difficulties in means of production and overcome natural disasters to a certain extent, they have the conditions to engage in the reform of cultivation techniques. Now many mountainous areas have changed human-pulled plows to ox-drawn plows, fallow land is gradually becoming fixed cultivation, and fertilization and manure accumulation have begun. Wooden and bamboo agricultural implements have been partially replaced by iron agricultural implements, and the primitive farming habits of "slash-and-burn" are gradually changing. This has partially developed the potential of the mountainous areas, and this year's spring and summer crops in various high mountain areas have generally increased, some by several times.

    西南边沿山区逐步改变刀耕火种的耕作习惯
    农业生产潜力初步得到发挥
    战胜天灾兽害今年大小春作物普遍增产
    西南大都是多山地区。农民由于受历代反动派的残酷统治，生产极端落后，至今许多地方仍沿用刀耕火种、广种薄收的生产方式。
    为了改造和发展山区农业生产，各地党和政府都加强了山区生产的领导，在山区进行生产工具的改革。中共贵州省委今年六月即向各级党委发出关于领导山区生产的指示。云南省拟定了改造山区生产的五年计划，从省到县都成立“改进山区生产委员会”专门领导山区生产。四川省也进行了重点调查。贵州省镇远地委书记张玉环亲自带领工作组深入山区掌握重点，吸取和创造经验，指导一般山区生产。现在，各地已基本上克服了“只重视内地，不重视边沿”的倾向，扭转了基层干部不安心山区工作，认为没有前途的错误思想。
    为扶助山区生产，帮助农民克服发展生产中的困难，西南财政经济委员会今年发放了四百亿元的无偿农具，帮助山区人民进行生产工具改革，以铁制农具代替木制的原始生产工具。仅贵州省台江、炉山等十一县，即发放大、小农具十万零五千件。各县一般都派出工作组深入山区宣传政策，发放救济粮款和贷款。各地并组织了初级市场物资交流。贵州省在各地少数民族居住的山区举行了二百多次小型物资交流会，推销土、特产品一百八十亿元以上。山区农民卖出土、特产品后，随即购入大批生产资料。
    野兽对山区生产危害很大。云南、贵州、西康高山地区，历年都遭兽害，四川青川县危害人畜、农作物的野兽达二十种之多，害鸟也有八种，全县十五个乡的农作物，野兽损耗量达百分之四十至六十，群众称之为“天收一半，地收一半”。为防除兽害，许多地区都帮助群众解决了打兽所需要的火药、枪枝等困难，动员群众积极捕打。云南省在去年十二月拨下打兽贷款六亿多元、子弹三万多发。如陆良县四区斗咀村由于打死了十八只经常危害庄稼的野猪，今年的马铃薯就增产了一倍。
    山区旱灾、洪灾亦较平坝严重，许多地区不“旱”就“洪”，不“洪”就“旱”，严重影响生产。因之，兴修水利，借以防旱防洪和灌溉田地，对发展山区生产有着重大意义。云南省宣威、蒙自、玉溪等县的山区，最近均召开了区乡代表会，总结防洪、抗旱经验，检查了兴修水利情况。宣威县上窑乡，发动六百多农民新修堵水沟三条，将山水堵到坝塘里，防止了洪水，并蓄备了明年春耕的用水。贵州省至今年六月止，共在山区兴修和整修水利三千余处，保证了十五万六千六百余亩稻田的灌溉。
    山区农民由于减少了生产资料上的困难，在一定程度上战胜了自然灾害，因而有条件来从事耕作技术的改革。现在许多山区都把人拉犁改成牛拉犁，轮歇地逐渐变成固定耕作，并开始施肥、积肥，木竹器的农具，部分为铁制农具所代替，“刀耕火种”的原始耕作习惯在逐步改变。这样就部分地发挥了山区的潜在力，今年各地高山区大、小春作物普遍增产，有的增产好几倍。　　　　　（彭泽农）
