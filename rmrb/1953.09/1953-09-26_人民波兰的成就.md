Achievements of People's Poland
Ambassador of the People's Republic of Poland to China, Kirilołek

The Polish Economic Exhibition, the first of its kind held in Beijing, opened on September 26th. This exhibition not only demonstrates the economic and cultural achievements of the Polish people after the war, but will undoubtedly become an important factor in mutual learning and strengthening the friendship between China and Poland.

The purpose of holding the Polish Economic Exhibition is to introduce to the Chinese people the achievements of the People's Republic of Poland in politics, economy, society, and culture, the results of political and social reforms, and the achievements of the working people in urban and rural areas during the nine years of being masters of their own affairs. This exhibition also shows the contribution of the Polish people to the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, as well as our solidarity with the Chinese people who are fighting against imperialist aggression.

In his telegram congratulating China's National Day in 1952 to the leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Poland, Beirut said: "The Polish people ardently hope that the fraternal Chinese people will achieve further success in the struggle for the progress, development, and security of their motherland and the consolidation of world peace."

It is no accident that the relations between our two countries are closer today—after the Second World War—when the working class and working peasants in our two countries have formed a lasting alliance and won a great historical victory, and when both the People's Republic of Poland and the People's Republic of China have established people's power through revolution.

After years of liberation struggles, the people of China and Poland have joined the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, and have joined the camp of people fighting to prevent new acts of imperialist aggression.

The Soviet Union's brilliant victory in the war against Hitlerism in Europe and Japanese imperialism in Asia brought liberation to the people of both countries. The people of various people's democracies, the great liberated Chinese people, and the Asian nations striving for liberation are united around the Soviet Union under the banner of Marxism-Leninism.

Now, People's China is undertaking the enormous task of building the country, especially building industry. After completing this task, the Chinese people will become a stronger member of the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism led by the Soviet Union, and a beacon and example for the people of other countries in Asia.

But this task of the Chinese people is arduous. The Polish people have deeply experienced this on the road to rebuilding the country.

Before the war, Poland was an agricultural country with backward agriculture and culture. The destruction caused by the Hitler bandits in Poland during World War II was the most serious in Europe. But now, People's Poland has become an industrial-agricultural and maritime country with enormous economic potential.

Thanks to the selfless labor of the Polish working class, peasants, and working intellectuals, and the continuous assistance from the Soviet Union, we have not only rebuilt our country, but have also surpassed previous levels in economic and cultural development.

The current industrial production of Poland is more than three times that of before the war, and steel production is three times that of before the war; after the completion of the Six-Year Plan in 1955, steel production will reach 4.6 million tons. This figure, calculated per capita, is four times the pre-war output.

Thanks to the modernization and mechanization of coal mines, coal production this year will reach 85 million tons, and in 1955 it will reach 100 million tons, while in 1938 it was only 38.1 million tons. Modern equipment has now been installed in both old and new coal mines.

Electricity generation has increased greatly, and in 1955 it will be six times that of 1938.

The chemical industry is the second largest national industry after coal mining. The chemical industry manufactures many new products. The eighteen large-scale chemical factories currently under construction throughout the country will further increase the production of the chemical industry.

The output of cotton, wool, and silk products in Poland's textile industry has increased rapidly. The current output has exceeded the pre-war level, and calculated per capita, woolen fabrics have increased by two times, cotton fabrics by one and a half times, and silk fabrics by more than four times.

Great achievements have also been made in agriculture. Huge water conservancy projects are of great help to land reclamation and cultivation. Agricultural production has increased a lot. During the nine years, it has increased by 40 percent compared to before the war (calculated per capita). The industrialization and modernization of agriculture, the voluntary organization of collective farming, and the adoption of new working methods have resulted in increased crop yields: the average yield of crops after the war has increased from 11.1 quintals per hectare before the war to 13.5 quintals (each quintal is 100 kilograms). Polish farmers use 40,000 tractors (calculated at 15 horsepower) and 150,000 various agricultural machines.

Poland is developing even faster in manufacturing various items that were not manufactured before, including trucks, light vehicles, and bearings. Within one year, more than one hundred new types of industrial and transportation machines began to be manufactured.

The Polish Economic Exhibition is a clear demonstration of the industrial development of People's Poland. The exhibits well illustrate the great economic achievements that Poland has made in its nine years of peaceful work under the conditions of building socialism.

This brilliant and rapid development cannot be matched by any capitalist country. This development can only be achieved under a true democratic system. In this system, the working class under the leadership of the Marxist-Leninist party has seized power; there is no more unemployment and "surplus population"; and all the power of the national economy is used to serve the welfare of the entire society.

Due to economic achievements, People's Poland has also developed foreign trade and trades with the Soviet Union, various people's democratic countries, capitalist countries in Europe, and ports around the world.

It must be emphasized that People's Poland is prepared to maintain and develop trade relations with all countries on the basis of mutual respect for sovereignty and mutually beneficial commodity exchange.

We should especially mention the exchange of goods in the socialist market. This is related to the developing trade relations with the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries; this kind of trade relationship mutually assists each other, takes into account the needs and plans of the national economy, and mutually guarantees the supply of goods, thus greatly increasing the amount of commodity exchange in the socialist market.

Before mentioning the Sino-Polish commodity exchange, we should remember that the amount of commodity exchange between the two countries before the war was extremely small, less than 2 million US dollars in 1937, and about 1.3 million US dollars in 1938.

Trade relations between the People's Republic of China and the People's Republic of Poland developed when China was just liberated, based on the conditions of maximizing the needs of both countries and in line with the economic development plans of both countries.

In 1953, machinery and industrial equipment supplied by Poland to China accounted for about 45 percent of all goods; iron and non-ferrous metal products accounted for about 30 percent. Therefore, 75 percent of Poland's exports to China are for the development of industry, especially the basic means of production required for the development of heavy industry in accordance with the People's China construction plan.

Polish industry can meet part of the needs of People's China with many items, including: various machinery and equipment, the complete equipment of some factories, such as sugar factories, distilleries, chemical fertilizer factories, paper mills, chemical plants, and timber factories; in addition, Poland's exports also include locomotives, train carriages, smelting machinery, drilling machines and refrigerators, cement and building materials, iron and zinc products, trucks and tractors, electrical machinery and signaling equipment, fire-fighting equipment, various mother machines and precision machines, laboratory and scientific research instruments, agricultural machines, sugar, vegetable and economic crop seeds, paper and cellulose, leather and leather products, ceramic products, sanitary and electrical supplies, various medicines, chemicals and chemical acids, photographic film and paper, matches, rubber products, soap and wax. These are all beneficial imports for People's China, and Poland has included some of these items in the export list of trade agreements.

The trade relations between the two countries will further develop, because Poland will supply China with more and more industrial products, and on the other hand, Poland is a reliable sales market for China's raw materials, semi-finished products, and many food products. Especially of great importance to the economic development of Poland is that China supplies more and more raw materials for smelting and textile, raw hides, oils, as well as tobacco leaves, tea, and rice. The trade relations between China and Poland are for the continuous development of the economies of China and Poland and to meet the growing needs of both countries for consumer goods.

The continuous economic development of People's China and People's Poland has laid a solid foundation for strengthening the commodity exchange and economic cooperation between the two countries. For example, compared with 1950, the number of machinery and industrial equipment supplied by Poland to China in 1952 increased by four times, and this year it will increase by another one time compared with 1952.

The quantity of China's exports to Poland has also increased similarly. Compared with 1950, the raw materials for smelting increased by more than two times; oilseeds increased by five times; since 1951, the quantity of textile raw materials, tobacco leaves, tea, etc. has been continuously increased.

The amount of commodity exchange between People's Poland and People's China in 1952 was six times that of 1950; the trade agreement signed in May 1953 further laid the foundation for the development of trade relations between the two countries.

An important factor in the development of this trade relationship is the regular shipping line linking Polish ports and Chinese ports. Before the war, capitalist Poland had very few merchant ships and could not maintain regular shipping with the Far East. Now Polish giant modernized cargo ships maintain regular maritime shipping.

In addition to economic relations, we must also mention the development of cultural exchanges between the two countries. The Polish People's Song and Dance Troupe "Mazowsze" achieved great success in performances in many cities in China. Poles who came to China—workers, representatives of institutions and organizations, especially sailors—had more opportunities to see the great art and culture of the Chinese people.

Trade and cultural relations between Poland and China are based on equality, friendship, and mutual respect. This relationship is an important factor in the economic and cultural development of both countries. It is hoped that this economic exhibition of the People's Republic of Poland held in Beijing will promote the further development of friendly and cooperative relations between the People's Republic of Poland and the People's Republic of China.

    人民波兰的成就
    波兰人民共和国驻华大使　基里洛克
    在北京首次举行的波兰经济展览会在九月二十六日揭幕了。这一展览会不仅表现出战后波兰人民在经济和文化方面的成就，而且无疑的将成为中波两国彼此学习和加强两国友谊的重要因素之一。
    举行波兰经济展览会的目的是向中国人民介绍波兰人民共和国在政治、经济、社会和文化等方面的成就，政治与社会改革的结果以及城乡劳动人民在当家做主的九年期间的成绩。这一展览会同时显示出波兰人民对和平、民主与社会主义阵营的贡献以及我们和为反对帝国主义侵略而斗争的中国人民的团结一致。
    波兰人民共和国部长会议主席贝鲁特在一九五二年祝贺中国国庆时致中国人民领袖毛泽东的电文中说：“波兰人民热烈地希望兄弟般的中国人民，在争取自己祖国的进步、发展和安全以及巩固世界和平的斗争中，获得进一步的成就。”
    在第二次世界大战之后的今天——当我们两个国家内的工人阶级和劳动农民结成了持久的联盟而获得了伟大的历史性胜利时，当波兰人民共和国和中华人民共和国都是经过革命而建立了人民的政权时——我们两国之间的关系更为紧密了，这并不是偶然的。
    中波两国人民在经过了多年的解放斗争后，已加入了和平、民主与社会主义的阵营之中，已加入了为防止帝国主义新侵略行动而斗争的人民阵营之中。
    苏联在对欧洲的希特勒主义和对亚洲的日本帝国主义的战争中取得了辉煌的胜利而给两国人民带来了解放。各人民民主国家人民、伟大的解放了的中国人民以及争取解放的亚洲各民族都在马克思列宁主义旗帜之下团结在苏联的周围。
    现在人民中国承当起建设国家，尤其是建设工业的巨大任务。中国人民在完成了这一任务后，将成为以苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义阵营中更强大的一员，以及亚洲其他各国人民的一个灯塔和榜样。
    但中国人民的这一任务是艰巨的。波兰人民在重建国家的道路中深深体验到这一点。
    波兰在战前是一个农业与文化落后的农业国。波兰在第二次大战期间所遭到的希特勒匪帮的破坏是欧洲各国中最严重的。但是现在人民波兰已成为
  一个工业—农业国和海洋国，而具有巨大的经济潜在力。
    由于波兰工人阶级、农民和劳动知识分子的忘我劳动以及苏联给予了不断的援助，我们不仅重建了我们的国家，而且在经济和文化的发展方面都已超过了以前的水平。
    现在波兰工业生产量已为战前的三倍以上，钢的生产量为战前的三倍；一九五五年完成六年计划后，钢的生产量将达到四百六十万吨。这一数字若以每一人口计算则达到战前产量的四倍。
    由于煤矿的现代化和煤矿工作的机械化，今年煤的产量将达到八千五百万吨，一九五五年时则将达到一亿吨，而一九三八年时的产量仅为三千八百一十万吨。现在旧有和新建的煤矿都安装了现代化的设备。
    发电量增加了很多，一九五五年时的发电量将为一九三八年时的六倍。
    化学工业是仅次于采煤工业的第二个规模巨大的国家工业。化学工业制造了许多新产品。现在全国各地建筑中的十八个大规模化学工厂将进一步提高化学工业的生产量。
    波兰纺织工业的棉、毛与丝制品的产量增加很快。现在的产量已超过战前的水平，若以每一人口计算，毛织品增加为二倍，棉织品增加为一倍半，丝织品增加为四倍多。
    农业方面也获得了伟大的成就。巨大的水利工程对于开荒和耕种有很大帮助。农业生产量增加了很多。九年期间，比战前增加了百分之四十（以每一人口计算）。农业的工业化和现代化，在自愿的基础上组织集体耕种以及采用新工作方法的结果增加了农作物的产量：战后农作物平均产量已由战前的每一公顷十一点一夸特增至十三点五夸特（每一夸特为一百公斤）。波兰农民应用了四万部拖拉机
  （以十五马力计算）以及各种农业机器十五万架。
    波兰在制造以前未制造过的各种物品方面的发展更快，其中包括卡车、轻型汽车和轴承等。在一年期间内，开始制造出一百多种新型的工业和运输机器。
    波兰经济展览会是人民波兰工业发展的明证。展览品很好地说明了波兰在建设社会主义基础条件下的九年和平工作中所获得的伟大经济成就。
    这种辉煌而迅速的发展是任何资本主义国家所赶不上的。这一发展只有在真正的民主制度下才能实现。在这一制度中，马克思列宁主义党领导下的工人阶级掌握了政权；再没有失业和“人口过剩”的现象；国民经济的全部力量都用在为整个社会的福利而服务。
    由于经济方面的成就，人民波兰也发展了对外贸易而和苏联、各人民民主国家、欧洲的资本主义国家以及世界各港口通商。
    必须着重指出，人民波兰准备在互相尊重主权和互利的货物交换的基础上与各国维持和发展贸易关系。
    我们应当特别提到社会主义市场的货物交换。这和苏联以及各人民民主国家正在发展中的贸易关系有着联系；这种贸易关系是互相协助并互相考虑到国民经济的需要和计划并互相保证货物供应的条件，因而使社会主义市场上的货物交换额大大增加。
    在提到中波货物交换以前，我们应当记住战前两国的货物交换额极小，一九三七年尚不足二百万美元，一九三八年时约为一百三十万美元。
    中华人民共和国和波兰人民共和国之间的贸易关系，在中国才获得解放时，就根据最大限度满足两国的需要以及符合两国经济发展计划的条件发展起来。
    一九五三年波兰供给中国的机器和工业设备约占全部货物的百分之四十五；铁和有色金属的制品约占百分之三十。因此，波兰向中国输出物品的百分之七十五是为了发展工业，尤其是按照人民中国建设计划为发展重工业所需用的基本生产工具。
    波兰工业能以许多物品来满足人民中国的部分需要，这些物品主要包括：各种机器设备，有些工厂的全部装备，如制糖厂、制酒厂、化学肥料厂、造纸厂、化学厂与木材厂等；此外波兰的输出品还包括机车、火车车厢、冶炼机器、钻探机与冷藏机、水泥与建筑器材、铁与锌的制品、卡车与拖拉机、电机与信号设备、防火装备、各种母机与精密机器、实验室与科学研究用仪器、农业机器、糖、蔬菜与经济作物种子、纸与纤维素、皮革与皮制品、陶瓷制品、卫生与电气方面用品、各种药品、化学品与化学酸类、摄影用胶卷与纸、火柴、橡皮制品、肥皂和蜡等。这些都是对人民中国有利的输入品，波兰已把这些物品的一部分列入贸易协定的输出品名单中。
    两国的贸易关系将进一步发展，因为波兰将供给中国越来越多的工业品，另一方面波兰又是中国原料、半制成品和许多食品的可靠的销售市场。尤其对波兰经济发展有极大重要性的是中国供给了越来越多的冶炼与纺织用原料、生皮、油脂以及烟叶、茶叶与大米等。中波两国的贸易关系是为了不断地发展中波两国的经济和满足两国对消费品的日益增长着的需要。
    人民中国和人民波兰的不断的经济发展，为加强两国货物交换和经济合作奠定了巩固的基础。例如一九五二年与一九五○年相比，波兰供给中国的机器和工业设备的数量增加为四倍，今年将比一九五二年再增加一倍。
    中国对波兰输出品的数量也同样增加了。一九五二年与一九五○年相比，冶炼原料增加为两倍多；油籽增加为五倍；自一九五一年以来更不断地增加纺织原料、烟叶、茶叶等的数量。
    人民波兰和人民中国一九五二年的货物交换额为一九五○年的六倍；五月签订的一九五三年贸易协定更为进一步发展两国贸易关系打下了基础。
    这种贸易关系发展的一个重要因素是联结波兰港口与中国港口之间的定期航运线。战前的资本主义波兰的商船很少，更不能和远东维持定期航运。现在波兰巨型近代化的货船维持了定期的海上航运。
    除了经济关系之外，我们也必须提到两国文化交流的发展情形。波兰人民歌舞团“玛佐夫舍”在中国许多城市表演而获得巨大的成就。来到中国的波兰人——工人，机关与团体的代表，尤其是海员——更有机会能看到中国人民的伟大艺术与文化。
    波兰与中国的贸易和文化关系是建立在平等、友谊和互相敬爱的基础上。这一关系是两国经济和文化发展的一个重要因素。希望在北京举行的这次波兰人民共和国经济展览会将促使波兰人民共和国和中华人民共和国之间友谊与合作关系的进一步发展。
