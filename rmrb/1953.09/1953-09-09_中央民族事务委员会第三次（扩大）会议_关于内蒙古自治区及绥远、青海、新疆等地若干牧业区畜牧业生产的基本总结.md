    The Third (Enlarged) Meeting of the Central Nationalities Affairs Commission
    Basic Summary of Animal Husbandry Production in Some Pastoral Areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Suiyuan, Qinghai, Xinjiang, etc.
    (June 15, 1953)

    (I) Overview of Animal Husbandry in Pastoral Areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Suiyuan, Qinghai, Xinjiang, etc.

    China has a large area of pastoral regions, with over 90 percent located in areas inhabited by minority nationalities. The minority nationalities engaged in animal husbandry include Mongolians, Tibetans, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Tajiks, etc., totaling approximately 3.5 million people. Animal husbandry is the main economic source of livelihood and development for the people of these pastoral regions, and it is an important component of China's New Democratic economy. Developing animal husbandry is fundamental to developing the economy of pastoral regions, improving the lives of various nationalities in these areas, and resolving nationality issues. It is also an indispensable part of national industrialization and agricultural development.

    The large number of livestock in the pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Suiyuan, Qinghai, Xinjiang, etc., indicates that animal husbandry production is relatively developed in these regions; however, it does not mean that animal husbandry was thriving in these areas before liberation.

    Before liberation, the cruel oppression and plunder by imperialism and domestic reactionary rule, coupled with the devastation of the long-term feudal system, caused severe disasters for the people of all nationalities in the pastoral regions, leading to a gradual decline in animal husbandry production in various pastoral areas. For example, in Xinba Left Banner of Hulunbuir League in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, there were 584,794 heads of livestock in 1939. By 1945, when it was liberated during the "September 3rd" victory, there were only 287,978 heads, a decrease of 50.8 percent. In Qinghai Province, the total number of livestock in 1949 when it was liberated was 52.4 percent lower than in 1937. In Dalate Banner of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in the Suiyuan Province, 19 households along the Yellow River had their livestock numbers decline by 50% for cattle, 89% for horses, and 29% for sheep, compared to before the Anti-Japanese War.

    After liberation, thanks to the deep concern of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government for the development of animal husbandry in all minority nationalities, and the clear stipulation in Article 34 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to "protect and develop animal husbandry," along with effective support in various aspects, and the efforts of local people's governments, people of all nationalities in the pastoral areas, and cadres, animal husbandry production in various pastoral areas gradually recovered and developed. For example, the number of livestock in the Inner Mongolia pastoral areas increased from over 3.5 million in 1947 to over 7 million in 1952, doubling in five years. Xinba Left Banner in Inner Mongolia had only 287,978 heads of livestock in 1945, which further decreased to 280,000 in 1946, but by 1952, it had 680,000 heads, an increase of nearly 1.5 times, exceeding the highest number of livestock before liberation. Uxin Banner in Suiyuan Province had 198,927 heads of livestock when it was liberated in 1949, and 246,940 heads in 1951, an increase of 24.2 percent in three years. Qinghai Province increased by 20 percent in the three years after liberation. Xinjiang Province increased by 18 percent in the three years after liberation.

    As a result of the development of animal husbandry production in the Inner Mongolia pastoral areas, the production and living conditions of people at all levels have changed significantly. According to a survey in Xinba Right Banner, Hulunbuir League, in the four years from 1948 to 1952, the number of destitute households without livestock decreased from 0.21 percent of the population to 0.07 percent. The number of poor herding households owning less than 210 heads of livestock decreased from 42.91 percent of the population to 23.88 percent. The number of middle-income herding households owning less than 2,100 heads of livestock increased from 54 percent to 67.08 percent. The number of wealthy herding households and herdlords owning more than 2,100 heads of livestock increased from 2.87 percent to 8.97 percent. This indicates that the trend of socio-economic development in the pastoral areas is that poor herders are generally improving, the number of middle-income herders is rapidly increasing, and the economy of wealthy herders and herdlords is also developing considerably. However, the development of animal husbandry production in various pastoral areas is uneven, and the accumulation of total social wealth is also uneven. The resolution of the difficulties faced by a significant number of poor herders and the gradual change of the uneven state require long-term and arduous efforts.

    The pastoral areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region were liberated earlier and implemented regional autonomy and democratic reforms earlier. Because the implementation of various policies and guidelines under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government has been basically correct, and errors in some areas and work due to the implementation of policies deviating from actual conditions and disregarding specific conditions have been constantly corrected, the region has achieved the result of doubling its livestock in several years (in the past, even under normal circumstances of livestock development, it usually took about ten, fifteen, or even more years). Production techniques have been improved, disputes and problems hindering the development of animal husbandry production that were left over from history have been basically resolved, unity among nationalities and within nationalities has been strengthened, the people's economic and cultural lives have been improved and raised, and the social economy has developed forward. The people of all nationalities, especially the people of pastoral areas, cannot but pay attention to this change. Therefore, summarizing the experience of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is necessary for the people of Inner Mongolia and for the people of other relevant nationalities.

    The gradual development of animal husbandry in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is inseparable from the democratization of the pastoral areas. The establishment of the New Democratic regime has guaranteed the smooth implementation of various correct guidelines and policies and the smooth development of animal husbandry production.

    Pastoral areas in Suiyuan, Qinghai, Xinjiang, and other places were liberated later. In some of these areas, the implementation of guidelines and policies was better, various tasks were relatively smooth, animal husbandry production was restored and developed to a certain extent, and much experience has been gained. In some of these areas, deviations occurred in the work to varying degrees, but some experience was also gained after correcting these deviations. Therefore, summarizing the experience of these areas is also necessary.

    (II) Working Guidelines for Developing Animal Husbandry Economy

    The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and some pastoral areas of Suiyuan, Qinghai, Xinjiang, etc., generally implemented the following working guidelines when developing the animal husbandry economy:

    1.  The working guideline of prudence and steadiness. Based on the characteristics of the socio-economic situation of the pastoral areas, it is emphasized that one should start from the actual situation of the local pastoral areas, combine with the personal experience of the herders, adopt a prudent and steady working guideline, carry out work step by step, and prevent rash advances and coercive orders. This is absolutely necessary. Since the animal husbandry economy is generally a private, small-scale individual production economy, animal husbandry production mainly relies on the natural reproduction of livestock and is greatly affected by natural conditions (such as wind, snow, water, and drought disasters). Its specific organization and leadership are much more difficult than in agricultural areas, and improper measures can easily lead to losses. Many of our cadres are unfamiliar with animal husbandry production and do not understand or do not fully understand the laws of animal husbandry production development. Due to long-term national oppression, complex national relations have been created in the pastoral areas, and national estrangement is difficult to eliminate completely in a short period of time. Therefore, in the work of developing animal husbandry production, it is necessary to closely integrate with the united front of uniting people of all nationalities and all social strata, strengthen unity among nationalities and within nationalities, stabilize social order, carry out medical treatment and trade, train national cadres, and promote national regional autonomy. In terms of working methods, it is emphasized to adopt in-depth investigation and research, summarize experience, cultivate typical examples, establish banners, and promote step by step using simple methods that are easy for herders to accept. At the same time, attention should be paid at all times to preventing and overcoming tendencies such as laissez-faireism and blind rashness in the work, which are harmful to the development of animal husbandry production, especially preventing the mistake of neglecting the production characteristics and national characteristics of the pastoral areas and transplanting the methods of agricultural areas to pastoral areas. In terms of work style, it is emphasized to maintain close contact with the masses, prevent coercive orders, and be good at listening to the opinions of people of all nationalities and all social strata, understanding their difficulties, sufferings, demands, calls, and psychological feelings. It is necessary to examine at all times whether the policy measures can be accepted by people of all strata. Some things, even if they are beneficial to the masses, should not be done temporarily if everyone does not understand them and the conditions are not yet ripe. In the past, some areas failed to implement this guideline well, and some deviations occurred, which greatly affected the development of the local animal husbandry economy and even caused losses. After the deviations were corrected, animal husbandry production returned to the normal track. It can be seen from this that only by correctly implementing this working guideline can the animal husbandry economy in the pastoral areas develop normally and smoothly. In the future, the Party and the people's governments in all relevant places should continue to firmly implement it.

    2.  Developing animal husbandry production is the regular central task of the pastoral areas. All work should revolve around this central task of production and serve the development of production. It should be recognized that only when animal husbandry production develops can the animal husbandry economy develop, the lives of the people in the pastoral areas improve, and other work in the pastoral areas have a material basis, which is beneficial to the development of the national economy as a whole. The ultimate goal of all work of the People's Government in the pastoral areas is only one, which is to develop production in the pastoral areas and improve the lives of the people in the pastoral areas. To develop production, it is necessary to strengthen unity among nationalities and within nationalities, solve various problems hindering the development of animal husbandry production, and change the long-standing backward state of livestock breeding methods, production techniques, and incomplete production organization, as well as the weak resistance to various natural disasters caused by them.

    In carrying out work in the pastoral areas, some people have had erroneous ideological tendencies such as "valuing agriculture over animal husbandry" and "the backwardness of animal husbandry." The reasons for these errors are: first, it is mechanically believed that the transformation of nomadic economy to agricultural economy is a kind of progress from a historical point of view, so today's animal husbandry production has no future if it is not changed to agriculture. They do not understand that due to the more detailed social and economic division of labor, due to economic development, industry and agriculture, the state and the people need a large number of livestock and animal products, and animal husbandry production has broad prospects in the present and future, and animal husbandry production also has the prospect of modernization. Second, among the cadres working in the pastoral areas, some cadres grew up in agricultural areas and worked in agricultural areas for a long time, and do not understand animal husbandry production, so it is easy to ignore the characteristics of the pastoral areas and the importance of animal husbandry production. Third, they do not understand that developing animal husbandry production is the necessary way to develop the economy of the pastoral areas, improve the lives of the people in the pastoral areas, and enable all nationalities to get rid of poverty and backwardness. These errors have affected the development of animal husbandry production. Therefore, criticizing these ideas and educating these comrades has become a task that should be paid attention to regularly.

    3.  Strengthen and consolidate national unity. Because of the enemy's instigation, great-Han chauvinism and narrow nationalism still exist in some areas, and there are still historical feuds, conflicts of interest, and other disputes within some minority nationalities. Therefore, in a considerable period after liberation, there will still be disunity among nationalities and within nationalities in various pastoral areas, which will directly affect the development of the animal husbandry economy. In order to strengthen national unity, various localities have adopted methods such as: exposing enemy conspiracies, punishing counter-revolutionaries, strengthening patriotism and internationalism education, combining with the resolution of practical problems to overcome great-Han chauvinism, first and foremost Han chauvinism, and narrow nationalist ideological tendencies, mediating and persuading both sides to reach national unity through self-criticism and mutual concessions. The implementation of this guideline has eliminated the phenomenon of estrangement, discrimination, and even mutual robbery and vendetta among nationalities, consolidated national unity, and strengthened mutual assistance among nationalities. National harmony, and peaceful grasslands, enable production to achieve great development.

    Cadre unity is the key to national unity. Therefore, cadres working in pastoral areas, especially Han cadres, must recognize the important significance of animal husbandry production, establish the viewpoint of serving the people of all nationalities and building the motherland in the pastoral areas for a long time, and overcome unhealthy ideas such as neglecting work in the pastoral areas, disliking the backwardness of work in the pastoral areas, and fearing difficulties and not being at ease in their work. It is necessary to regularly prevent ideological tendencies of great-Han chauvinism such as neglecting national characteristics and the actual situation of the pastoral areas, not paying attention to national relations, and not respecting the religious beliefs, customs, languages, and writing of various nationalities. At the same time, it is also necessary to educate minority nationality cadres to prevent and overcome narrow nationalist tendencies and narrow professional viewpoints such as not actively striving for the help of fraternal nationalities and foreign cadres, not paying attention to unity with them, and thinking that animal husbandry can be developed in isolation without the help of industry and agriculture.

    4.  Vigorously train ethnic cadres in pastoral areas. The people in pastoral areas have been engaged in animal husbandry production for a very long time. They are not only familiar with the laws of animal husbandry production, but also have deep feelings for animal husbandry production. Training a group of cadres of their own nationality who understand policies and are familiar with animal husbandry production knowledge and technology, enabling them to take on the leadership of animal husbandry production, making it easier for the People's Government's policies for developing animal husbandry production to be combined with the enthusiasm of the masses, and making it easier for advanced scientific methods to be combined with the inherent experience of the masses, is of decisive significance for the development of the economy in the pastoral areas. As a result of implementing this guideline in various pastoral areas, such ethnic cadres have begun to grow.

    5.  Implement the guideline of "prosperity for both people and livestock." The population of pastoral areas is generally not prosperous. To develop animal husbandry production, it is also necessary to make the population prosperous. Therefore, people's health and population increase are also of paramount importance in the work of pastoral areas. Various localities have adopted many measures, such as increasing medical and health equipment, providing free treatment for poor people, carrying out maternal and child health work, and rewarding childbirth, to implement this guideline, and have achieved great results. In 1952, the Xinjiang Military Region dispatched medical teams to go deep into pastoral areas to treat diseases for herders of all nationalities. In the six months from May to November alone, the initial diagnoses of syphilis, rheumatism, gastrointestinal diseases, and skin diseases reached 63,018 people, and 41,269 people were re-diagnosed. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has generally treated the people in the pastoral areas for venereal diseases, and venereal diseases have been basically cured in many areas. The population in the pastoral areas has begun to show signs of prosperity, and the labor force for animal husbandry production has been increased. Now "prosperity for both people and livestock" has become a slogan that inspires the people in the pastoral areas to move forward and is wholeheartedly supported by the people in the pastoral areas.

    (III) Various Policies for Developing Animal Husbandry Economy

    According to the guideline for developing the animal husbandry economy and the actual conditions of various pastoral areas, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the above-mentioned pastoral areas have adopted different steps to implement several policies, the main ones being the following eleven:

    1.  In the pastoral areas, the policy of "no struggle, no division, no class demarcation" and mutual benefit for both herdsmen and herd owners was implemented. The policy of preserving the herd owner economy and "no struggle, no division, no class demarcation" was formulated according to the actual conditions of the pastoral areas and the characteristics of the animal husbandry economy. The animal husbandry economy includes the herd owner economy. The business model of the herd owner economy is to hire labor, which has a capitalist nature. The development of the herd owner economy is beneficial rather than harmful to the entire New Democratic national economy. Facts have proven that animal husbandry production has developed and people's lives have improved in places where this policy is correctly implemented. The leading authorities in some areas, because they do not understand the nature of the herd owner economy, do not understand that the development of the herd owner economy is beneficial to the development of production and economic prosperity, and copied the methods of agricultural areas, took detours sooner or later, causing losses to animal husbandry production. An important issue in implementing the policy of mutual benefit for both herdsmen and herd owners is the wage issue. Inner Mongolia has implemented the transformation of the old "Suluke" system (herd owners entrust herdsmen to graze livestock and give herdsmen very few living supplies) to the new "Suluke" system (herd owners entrust herdsmen to graze livestock, and herdsmen receive wages based on reasonable wage contracts), so that the livestock of herdsmen has developed, and the livestock of herd owners has also developed. For example, in Hatun Hoshoba Gaga, Bayanhada Sumu, Chen Barag Banner, there are 45 middle-income and poor herding households with 219 people in total. In 1948, they had 1,217 heads of livestock, with 5 to 6 heads per person. In the four years up to 1952, it has developed to 4,935 heads, an increase of more than three times, and now there is an average of 22.6 heads of livestock per person. Another example is the herd owner Maolama in Xinba Left Banner, who had nearly 700 heads of various livestock when it was liberated in 1945. In the seven years up to 1952, it has developed to 2,100 heads, an increase of exactly two times. In implementing the wage policy, two methods were generally adopted: one is that herdsmen and herd owners negotiate and sign contracts and abide by them together; the other is that the representatives of herdsmen and herd owners negotiate and stipulate a unified wage standard in a small area with the same production conditions. Experience in various places has proven that both of these methods are feasible and can achieve voluntariness and mutual benefit if implemented well. According to the experience of various places, the standard of wages cannot be forced to be uniform due to different production development and other specific conditions. It should not be too high at the beginning in general. With the development of production, it should be appropriately raised to a more reasonable level. It should achieve the purpose of improving the lives of herdsmen, improving the enthusiasm of herdsmen in production, and encouraging the enthusiasm of herd owners in management. In the implementation of the wage policy, some deviations have also occurred in some areas. One is to stipulate excessively high wage standards, forcing herd owners to hire workers, and not allowing herd owners to use and freely buy and sell livestock. This practice of infringing on the private property rights of herd owners is wrong. The other is not protecting the interests of herdsmen, allowing herd owners to reduce herdsmen's wages and delay payment of wages at will, and arbitrarily dismiss herdsmen in violation of contracts. This practice is also wrong. These errors should continue to be prevented and corrected.

    2.  Reasonably resolve the issue of grassland and pastures. At present, the grasslands and pastures in various pastoral areas are owned by nationalities or tribes, privately owned by individuals or temples, and leased between nationalities and tribes. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, where grasslands and pastures are owned by nationalities, has implemented a policy of free grazing and adjusting pastures. In areas where grasslands and pastures are privately owned by temples and individuals (such as Qinghai and Xinjiang), the approach was adopted of starting from the status quo, taking into account history, taking into account the overall situation, and paying special attention to the smaller nationalities, which is conducive to production and unity between nationalities and within nationalities. Through consultations with representatives of people of all nationalities and leaders who are connected with people of all nationalities, grasslands and pastures were adjusted, and disputes between nationalities and within nationalities were resolved. In Qinghai Province alone, more than 3,000 disputes have been mediated and resolved since liberation. In areas where disputes arise between nationalities and tribes due to the lease of grasslands and pastures, the rental amount is appropriately adjusted through consultation. This strengthened unity within and between nationalities, initially eliminating obstacles to the development of production for the peoples of pastoral areas.

    3.  Implement a policy of supporting animal husbandry production, especially supporting poor herdsmen's production. Because animal husbandry production has been in a state of decline for a long time in the past, the People's Government has provided support in various aspects, such as organizing material exchanges, issuing loans, lending production tools and feed, and implementing free epidemic prevention injections, so that animal husbandry production can be quickly restored and developed. For poor herdsmen, the People's Government has adopted the method of solving the difficulties of herdsmen through the development of production, and has paid attention to correcting the erroneous attitude of neglecting support for poor herdsmen, guaranteeing the political rights of poor herdsmen, educating herdsmen to enhance the concept of labor, and rewarding active production; helping capable herdsmen, and helping them rise economically by means of production mutual aid, appropriate adjustment of wages, issuing loans, developing free lending, and encouraging mutual assistance and mutual support among herdsmen. Since liberation, the Central People's Government has issued loans to various pastoral areas, 22.2 billion to Inner Mongolia and 14.4 billion to Suiyuan. In addition, relief funds are also issued to areas affected by disasters. In issuing loans and relief, we have helped poor herdsmen solve the difficulties of lacking ewes, breeding animals, grass cutting machines, wood for wells, tents, yurts, bean cake, and waterwheels. In 1950, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region lent 7,000 sheep to poor herdsmen in Chen Barag Banner, Hulunbuir League. After one year, according to a survey, the average increase rate was 44.9 percent, and the production and living conditions of the loan households were generally improved.

    4.  Organize mutual support between industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry, and develop trade cooperation in pastoral areas. Animal husbandry production must be developed with the help of industry and agriculture and in coordination with the development of industry and agriculture. Since liberation, the Central People's Government and the People's Governments of Inner Mongolia, Suiyuan, Qinghai, Xinjiang, and other places have actively developed trade cooperation in pastoral areas, supplying pastoral areas with a large amount of grain every year, greatly reducing the consumption of livestock; supplying feed such as bean cake, overcoming the difficulties of livestock lacking feed for the winter; and supplying production tools and daily necessities, overcoming many difficulties in production and life. In the past few years, pastoral areas have also transported a large number of livestock to agricultural areas, supplying draft animals needed by agriculture and helping the development of agriculture. At the same time, a large amount of fur and other industrial raw materials have been supplied to industrial production. In 1952 alone, the state-owned trading company in the Hulunbuir League pastoral area of ​​the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region exported 68,577 head of livestock. In 1952, Qinghai State-owned Trading Company purchased 1,050,228 various animal skins and 683,600 casings. In 1952, Xinjiang State-owned Trading Company purchased 1,825,790 catties of various animal wool and 1,866,050 various animal skins. Due to the development of trade cooperation in pastoral areas, the excessive exploitation of herdsmen by illegal merchants has been reduced, and the price of animal husbandry products has been unprecedentedly increased. Therefore, the purchasing power of herdsmen has been greatly increased and the lives of herdsmen have been improved. For example, before the liberation of the pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia, the purchasing power of the herdsmen was extremely low. In 1951, the average purchasing power of each herdsman increased to 433,000 yuan, and in 1952 it increased to 506,000 yuan. After the mobile group of Qinghai Trading Company went deep into the pastoral area, the Tibetan Vimu Zang in Guide Jianzha District gratefully said: "In the past, when I went to Guide, several loads of wool could be exchanged for a load of tea. Today, the trading company has come to the yurt, and one load of wool can be exchanged for a load of tea." However, our work still has shortcomings. Grain cannot be transported to some pastoral areas, and livestock and animal products cannot be transported out of some pastoral areas. There are also unreasonable price ratios between animal products and industrial and agricultural products, and the price of purchasing animal products is somewhat high. We should pay attention to this in the future. Trade departments should take care of pastoral areas where production has not yet recovered and people's lives are still difficult. Under special circumstances, even if there is a slight loss, they should maintain the supply. They should appropriately help pastoral areas establish markets and package trade stations, and plan and focus on supporting mass organizations to organize supply and marketing cooperatives. Under the leadership and organization of trade administrative organs and state-owned trade enterprises, we should implement fair and reasonable price policies, restore commercial trade relations between people, unite legitimate private merchants, and oppose any fraudulent behavior against the people of minority nationalities. In order to exchange materials, all localities should make full use of the existing transportation tools of herdsmen, and, if possible, appropriately repair roads and add new transportation tools.

    5.  In semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas or areas where agriculture and animal husbandry are intertwined, focus on developing animal husbandry production and adopt a policy of protecting pastures and prohibiting wasteland reclamation. Because these areas are not only intertwined with agriculture and animal husbandry, but also mostly inhabited by various nationalities, there have long been contradictions in agricultural and animal husbandry production and ethnic disputes. Now, transportation in these areas is extremely inconvenient, and it is difficult to transport grain out. Many of them are also unsuitable for agriculture due to soil and climate. After wasteland reclamation, they often become rotation lands, reclaimed and abandoned as they go, and the area of ​​sandy wasteland increases, which not only shrinks and damages pastures, but also easily leads to wind, sand, water, and drought disasters, which is detrimental to both animal husbandry and agricultural production, resulting in farmers and herdsmen working hard every year but not being able to become rich. Therefore, prohibiting wasteland reclamation and delineating pastures have become extremely important measures. Facts have proven that farmers and herdsmen will receive practical benefits in areas where this policy is resolutely implemented. According to materials from Ikhozhao League, Suiyuan Province, in 1952, a laborer can cultivate 100 mu of land a year and harvest about 4,000 catties of millet, which is worth about 1.6 million yuan, but ten sheep can be sold for 2 million yuan. Therefore, developing animal husbandry in these areas is more beneficial to the local people than developing agriculture. However, in these areas, agricultural and animal husbandry relations and ethnic relations are complex and intertwined, and special care must be taken in handling them. Otherwise, the goals of strengthening national unity, mutually developing production, resolving agricultural and animal husbandry contradictions, and resolving ethnic disputes cannot be achieved. The general method is to delineate the boundaries of farmland and pastures, organize mutual assistance between farmers and herdsmen, and promote and encourage farmers to engage in animal husbandry. In small agricultural areas in pastures, the development of animal husbandry production can be gradually guided on a voluntary basis, and the government can provide help and care if there are difficulties. In areas where both agricultural and animal husbandry production are suitable for development, the area of ​​farmland and pastures should be fixed, and agriculture and animal husbandry should be developed separately. In resolving agricultural and animal husbandry contradictions and ethnic disputes, it must be clearly recognized that although these contradictions and disputes were caused by historical national oppression, they have generally become internal problems between working people today, and only methods of persuasion and help can be adopted. Expulsion is not allowed, and the overall situation must be taken care of, especially the minority. As a result, coupled with the strengthening of national unity in politics, not only can the contradictions in agricultural and animal husbandry production be overcome and production be developed, but also agricultural and animal husbandry contradictions can be transformed into agricultural and animal husbandry mutual assistance, and ethnic disputes left over from history can also be resolved.

    6.  Taxation policies that are lighter than those in agricultural areas and cities have been adopted to allow herdsmen to recuperate and thrive. In the early days of liberation, all localities took into account the difficulties of the people in pastoral areas and reduced or exempted the taxes that herdsmen in pastoral areas should pay to the state for a certain period of time. After the development of animal husbandry production, reasonable taxation policies with very light tax rates were also implemented. At present, some pastoral areas implement progressive progressive taxes with exemption points and progressive maximum rates, and some implement proportional taxes. The tax rates are very light. The collection of livestock tax generally collects livestock and fur and adopts simple procedures. The procedures in some individual pastoral areas are not simple enough, and the conversions are also unreasonable and should be improved. The implementation of reasonable taxation policies has stabilized the production sentiment of herdsmen and is conducive to the development of production.

    7.  A policy of steadily developing mutual assistance and cooperation among herdsmen has been implemented. Due to the needs of production development and the primitive mutual assistance habits that herdsmen have had in history, coupled with the leadership of the Party and the People's Government in various places, the mutual assistance and cooperation movement in pastoral areas has developed greatly in some areas. According to existing materials, herdsmen in Xinjiang and Qinghai already have temporary mutual assistance groups for fighting wolves, cutting grass, preventing fires, and sideline production. There are more than 1,000 seasonal animal husbandry production mutual assistance groups and agricultural and animal husbandry mutual assistance groups in the Suiyuan pastoral area and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral area. In Inner Mongolia, there are more than 2,600 mutual assistance groups of various types, including three types: one is mutual assistance groups for disaster prevention, lambing, cutting grass, fighting wolves, shearing wool, walking "Aoter" (grazing in places with good water and grass), and sideline production. This is a large number of organizations existing in pastoral areas and has a certain seasonality; one is joint grazing mutual assistance groups, which are mutual assistance organizations organized by herdsmen with fewer livestock to save labor. Such mutual assistance organizations are quite common in pastoral areas and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas; one is higher-form mutual assistance groups with year-round certain division of labor and production plans. Such mutual assistance organizations are not yet large in number at present. The implementation of labor mutual assistance has solved the difficulties of insufficient labor and production tools for herdsmen, and herdsmen have received practical benefits. For example, in the year before disaster prevention mutual assistance was universally organized in Xinba Right Banner, Inner Mongolia in 1949, 12,000 heads of livestock died during the winter. In the year of 1951 after disaster prevention mutual assistance was organized, only 700 heads died during the winter. Another example is the Huhhetai cooperative mutual assistance group of herdsmen in Chen Barag Banner, Hulunbuir League, Inner Mongolia. There are four households in total, with a total of four male and female laborers. They have three horses, 32 cattle, and six sheep. In 1950, the People's Government lent them 401 sheep and two horses. Because of the implementation of mutual assistance and cooperation, the group is divided into grazing groups and sideline groups, and a cooperation production agreement is established, which greatly improves labor efficiency. By 1952, the group's livestock had developed to 1,164 heads, two wells were built, two livestock sheds were built, and a grass mowing machine was purchased. In promoting mutual assistance and cooperation, some areas have made the mistake of coercion and command in the past, which must be resolutely prevented in the future. The promotion of mutual assistance and cooperation movements in pastoral areas must proceed from the needs of herdsmen's production, strictly abide by the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit, adopt the forms that herdsmen are most likely to accept, conduct typical pilot projects, and gradually promote them. What is currently advocated should be temporary and seasonal mutual assistance organizations. For higher-level mutual assistance organizations, only leadership organs can control pilot projects in places where conditions are met. It is better to have fewer but better, and not to be greedy and rash, so as not to hinder the progress of the mutual assistance and cooperation movement in pastoral areas.

    8.  Encourage settled nomadic life in places where conditions permit. Most of the pastoral areas in various places are nomadic areas, and some are settled and settled nomadic areas. Settled life and nomadic life each have their advantages and disadvantages. Settled life is good for "prosperous people", but because the amount of grass produced in natural pastures and grasslands is limited, it is not conducive to the development and reproduction of livestock. Nomadic life enables livestock to always eat good grass, which is good for livestock reproduction, but the whole family moves with the livestock all year round, which is extremely detrimental to "prosperous people". However, settled nomadic life can take into account the advantages of both and overcome the disadvantages of both under the current production conditions. Therefore, encouraging settled nomadic life in places where conditions are met, with some people (mainly young and middle-aged people) going out for nomadic life and some people (including the old, weak, and children) building homes in settled places, setting up health centers, planting pasture, growing vegetables, running schools, etc., and gradually organizing herdsmen under voluntary conditions to carry out mutual assistance and cooperation, will better achieve the goal of changing the living conditions of the people in the pastoral areas and achieving prosperity for both people and livestock.

    9.  Strengthen patriotic education, carry out livestock increase and protection competitions, cultivate labor models in pastoral areas, and reward working cadres and technicians. Various pastoral areas have paid attention to combining various tasks to conduct patriotic propaganda and education among the masses. Experience has proven that this is the driving force for improving the patriotic sentiment of herdsmen, encouraging labor enthusiasm, and promoting production development. Organizing people in pastoral areas to visit various places is a good way to carry out patriotic education, which can make them more aware of the greatness of the motherland, feel the warmth of the motherland, and thus further improve their patriotic sentiment and labor enthusiasm. The improvement of the patriotic and internationalist consciousness of the people in the pastoral areas can be illustrated by the following examples: For example, in the donation movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea in 1951, herdsmen in Inner Mongolia donated extremely enthusiastically. In the Xilin Gol League alone, 50,000 herdsmen donated more than 37,000 catties of meat floss and more than 400 million yuan in cash to the volunteers.

    Various places have combined patriotic education with livestock increase and protection competitions. For example, since 1951, herdsmen in West Sonid Banner, Xilin Gol League, Inner Mongolia, have launched a patriotic production competition to compete for red flags between Zuo and Zuo, and the net increase rate of livestock has rapidly increased from 0.3 percent to 23 percent. Labor model conferences have been held in pastoral areas such as Inner Mongolia, Suiyuan, and Xinjiang. Various mass gatherings, rewarding various production experts and labor models, comparing excellent livestock, and exchanging production experience have generally been adopted to improve and encourage the production sentiment of the masses.

    We must regularly pay attention to cultivating labor models and discovering various production experts in combination with various tasks. We must also be cautious when selecting them, and we must always pay close attention to ideological education.

    Because the work in pastoral areas is relatively arduous, various localities have given appropriate commendation and rewards to technicians and cadres in pastoral areas. Such rewards have played a good role in encouraging cadres to actively and diligently lead animal husbandry production. However, the work in this area has not been done enough, and more attention should be paid to it in the future.

    10. Develop handicraft production and sideline production, and appropriately hold certain small-scale industries that are closely related to animal husbandry production. There are already some small-scale industries and handicrafts in pastoral areas, such as livestock product processing – dairy products, felt-making, leather tanning

    中央民族事务委员会第三次（扩大）会议
    关于内蒙古自治区及绥远、青海、新疆等地若干牧业区畜牧业生产的基本总结
    （一九五三年六月十五日）
    （一）内蒙古自治区及绥远、青海、新疆等地牧业区畜牧业概况
    我国牧业区面积很大，其中有百分之九十以上是在少数民族聚居区。从事畜牧业生产的少数民族人民计有蒙古人、藏人、哈萨克人、柯尔柯孜人、塔吉克人……等，共约三百五十万人左右。畜牧业生产是牧业区各民族人民赖以生存发展的主要经济，是我国新民主主义经济的一个重要的组成部分。发展畜牧业生产是发展牧业区经济、改善牧业区各民族人民生活、解决牧业区民族问题的基本内容，也是国家工业化与发展农业生产不可缺少的部分。
    内蒙古自治区及绥远、青海、新疆等地牧业区的牲畜数是比较多的，说明这些地区的畜牧业生产是比较发展的；但并不表明这些地区的畜牧业在解放前就是发展的。
    解放前，由于帝国主义和国内反动统治的残酷压迫、掠夺以及长期封建制度的摧残，给牧业区各民族人民造成了严重的灾难，曾使得各牧业区畜牧业生产日趋衰落下降。如内蒙古自治区呼纳盟的新巴左旗，一九三九年有牲畜五十八万四千七百九十四头，到一九四五年“九三”解放时，只有二十八万七千九百七十八头，减少了百分之五十点八；青海省一九四九年解放时全省牲畜总数比一九三七年减少了百分之五十二点四；绥远省伊克昭盟蒙族自治区达拉特旗黄河畔村的十九户牧民，一九四九年解放时统计，和抗日战争前比较，牛减少了百分之五十，马减少了百分之八十九，羊减少了百分之二十九。
    解放后，由于中国共产党、毛主席和中央人民政府对全国各少数民族的畜牧经济发展给予了深切的关怀，在中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领第三十四条上明确规定了“保护和发展畜牧业”的方针，并在各方面给予了有效的扶持，加上当地人民政府与牧业区各族人民和干部的努力，各牧业区的畜牧业生产才得逐步恢复和发展。如内蒙古牧业区的牲畜自一九四七年的三百五十余万头至五二年的七百余万头，五年中已增加了一倍。内蒙古新巴左旗一九四五年只有牲畜二十八万七千九百七十八头，一九四六年又下降到二十八万头，而五二年已有牲畜六十八万头，增加了近一倍半，超过了解放前牲畜的最高数字。绥远省乌审旗在一九四九年解放时有牲畜十九万八千九百二十七头，而五一年已有牲畜二十四万六千九百四十头，三年中增加百分之二十四点二。青海省解放后的三年中增加了百分之二十。新疆省解放后的三年中增加了百分之十八。
    内蒙古牧业区畜牧业生产发展的结果，各阶层人民生产、生活情况均有显著变化。据呼纳盟新巴右旗的调查，在一九四八年到一九五二年的四年间，没有牲畜的赤贫户，由原占人口的百分之○．二一减少到百分之○．○七；占有二百一十头牲畜以下的贫苦牧户，由原占人口的百分之四十二．九一减少到百分之二十三．八八；占有二千一百头牲畜以下的中等牧户，由原占人口百分之五十四上升到百分之六十七．○八；占有二千一百头以上牲畜的富裕牧户和牧主，由原占人口的百分之二．八七上升到百分之八．九七。这就是说牧业区社会经济发展的趋势是：贫苦牧民普遍上升，中等牧民迅速增加，富裕牧民和牧主的经济也有相当大的发展。但是各个牧业区畜牧业生产的发展是不平衡的，社会总财富的积累状况也是不平衡的，相当数量的贫苦牧民困难的解决及不平衡状态的逐渐改变，还需要作长期的艰苦的努力。
    内蒙古自治区的牧业区是解放较早和实行区域自治与民主改革较早的地区，因为在中国共产党、毛主席和中央人民政府领导下，各项方针、政策的执行基本上是正确的，并不断地纠正了若干地区和若干工作中因执行政策时脱离实际情况和不顾具体条件所犯的错误，几年来获得了牲畜纯增一倍的成绩（在过去的时代，即使在牲畜发展的正常情况下，通常需要约十年、十五年甚至还要更多的时间），生产技术已经有了改进，历史上遗留下来的妨碍畜牧业生产发展的纠纷和问题基本得到解决，民族间与民族内部的团结加强了，人民的经济、文化生活改善和提高了，社会经济向前发展了。对于这种变化，各少数民族人民尤其是牧业区人民是不能不注意的。因此，总结内蒙古自治区的经验，对内蒙古民族人民和对其他有关各民族人民都是必要的。
    内蒙古自治区牧业区畜牧经济的逐步发展，是和牧业区政权的民主化分不开的，新民主主义政权的建立，保障了各项正确的方针、政策顺利地执行和畜牧业生产顺利地发展。
    绥远、青海、新疆等地的牧业区是解放较晚的地区。其中有些地区是执行方针、政策较好，各种工作比较顺利，畜牧业生产得到了恢复和一定程度的发展，并已经获得不少经验。其中有些地区则在工作中发生过不同程度的偏差，但在纠正了这些偏差之后也获得了若干经验。因此，总结这些地区的经验也是必要的。
    （二）发展畜牧业经济的工作方针
    内蒙古自治区及绥远、青海、新疆等地若干牧业区在发展畜牧业经济时，一般执行了如下的工作方针：
    一、慎重稳进的工作方针。根据牧业区社会经济的特点，强调从当地牧业区的实际情况出发，与牧民的切身经验相结合，采取慎重稳进的工作方针，有步骤地进行工作，防止急躁冒进和强迫命令是完全必要的。由于畜牧业经济一般是个体的私有的小生产经济，畜牧业生产主要依靠牲畜的自然繁殖，受自然条件的影响极大（如风、雪、水、旱的灾害），其具体组织和领导比农业区还要困难许多，措施不当，即很容易遭受损失；由于畜牧业生产对于我们许多干部还是生疏的事情，不懂得或不完全懂得畜牧业生产发展的规律；由于过去长期的民族压迫，造成了牧业区复杂的民族关系，民族隔阂在短时期内难于全部消除；因此，在发展畜牧业生产的工作中，应该紧密地结合着团结各民族各阶层人民的统一战线，加强民族间与民族内部的团结，安定社会秩序，开展医疗、贸易，培养民族干部，推行民族区域自治等工作来进行。在工作方法上，强调采取深入调查研究，总结经验，培养典型，树立旗帜，用牧民易于接受的简便方法，一步一步地推广。并要随时注意防止与克服工作中的放任自流、盲目冒进等有害于畜牧生产发展的倾向，特别是防止忽视牧业区的生产特点和民族特点，把农业区的办法搬套到牧业区去的错误作法。在工作作风上，强调密切联系群众，防止强迫命令，善于倾听各民族各阶层人民的意见，体会他们的困难、痛苦、要求、呼声和心理感情。必须随时考察政策措施是否能为各阶层人民所接受。有些事情，即使是对群众有好处的，但当大家还不懂得，条件还不成熟时，宁可暂时不办。过去有个别地区未能很好执行这一方针，发生过一些偏差，曾使当地畜牧业经济的发展受到很大影响，甚至受到损失，在纠正之后，畜牧业生产才又纳入正常轨道。由此可见，只有正确地贯彻执行这一工作方针，才能使牧业区畜牧经济得以正常地顺利地发展。今后各有关地方的党和人民政府仍然应该坚定不移地继续贯彻。
    二、发展畜牧业生产，是牧业区经常的中心工作任务。一切工作都要围绕生产这个中心工作去进行，并为发展生产服务。应该认识只有畜牧业生产发展了，畜牧业经济才能发展，牧业区人民生活才能改善，牧业区的其他工作才有物质基础，才对全国国民经济的发展有好处。人民政府在牧业区的一切工作最终目的只有一个，就是发展牧业区的生产，改善牧业区人民的生活。要发展生产就必须加强民族间与民族内部的团结，解决各种妨碍畜牧业生产发展的问题，改变长期存在的牲畜饲养方法、生产技术的落后状态与生产组织的不完备状态以及由此而引起的对各种自然灾害抵抗力薄弱的状态。
    在开展牧业区工作中，有一部分人曾产生过“重农轻牧”、“牧业落后论”等错误思想倾向。发生这些错误的原因：第一是机械地认为从历史上看游牧经济转变为农业经济是一种进步，因而今天的畜牧业生产不改变为农业是没有前途的。不了解由于现在社会经济分工的更加细密，由于经济的发展，工业和农业、国家和人民都需要大批的牲畜与畜产品，畜牧业生产在目前和将来都是有广阔前途的生产，畜牧业生产也有现代化的前途。第二，在牧业区工作的干部中，有一部分干部生长在农业区，长期在农业区工作，不懂得畜牧业生产，因而容易忽视牧业区的特点与畜牧业生产的重要性。第三，不了解发展畜牧业生产，是发展牧业区经济、改善牧业区人民生活，使各民族摆脱贫困与落后的必经道路。这些错误曾影响了畜牧业生产的发展。因此，批判这些思想，教育这些同志，就成为经常应该注意的工作。
    三、加强和巩固民族团结。因为有敌人的挑拨离间，有些地区大民族主义思想与狭隘民族主义思想还存在，某些少数民族内部还有历史仇隙、利益矛盾等纠纷，所以各牧业区在解放后的相当时期内，还会存在着民族间与民族内部的不团结现象，这种情况，也就会直接影响到畜牧业经济的发展。为了加强民族团结，各地采用了：揭露敌人阴谋，惩办反革命，加强爱国主义与国际主义教育，结合实际问题的解决来克服大民族主义、首先是大汉族主义与狭隘民族主义思想倾向，调解劝说双方以自我检讨互相让步等办法来达到民族团结。这一方针的实施，消除了民族间的隔阂、歧视甚至互相抢夺、仇杀的现象，巩固了民族团结，加强了民族间的互助。民族友爱，草原平静，生产就能得到大的发展。
    干部团结是民族团结的关键。因此，在牧业区工作的干部，尤其是汉族干部，必须认识畜牧业生产的重要意义，树立长期为牧业区各民族人民服务与建设祖国的观点。克服忽视牧业区工作、嫌牧业区工作落后、怕困难而不安心工作的不健康的思想。经常防止忽视民族特点和牧业区实际情况、不注意民族关系、不尊重各民族的宗教信仰、风俗习惯、语言文字等大民族主义的思想倾向。同时也必须教育少数民族干部，防止和克服不积极争取兄弟民族和外来干部的帮助，不注意和他们的团结，及认为不需要工业和农业的帮助也可以孤立地发展畜牧业的狭隘民族主义倾向和狭隘的职业观点。
    四、大力培养牧业区民族干部。牧业区人民从事畜牧业生产，已经有很长久的历史，他们不但熟悉畜牧业生产的规律，而且对畜牧业生产有深厚的感情。培养一批既懂得政策又熟悉畜牧业生产知识和技术的本民族的干部，使他们能够担当起畜牧业生产的领导工作，使人民政府发展畜牧业生产的政策更易于与群众的热情相结合，使先进的科学方法更易于与群众的固有的经验相结合，对发展牧业区经济有决定的意义。目前在各个牧业区执行这一方针的结果，这样的民族干部已经开始在成长。
    五、贯彻“人畜两旺”的方针。牧业区的人口一般是不兴旺的，要发展畜牧业生产，同时就必须使人口兴旺。因此，人民健康和人口增加，在牧业区工作中，也具有头等重要的意义。各地曾采取了许多措施，如增进医疗卫生设备，为贫苦人民免费治疗，开展妇幼卫生工作，奖励生育等来贯彻这一方针，已获得很大成绩。新疆军区一九五二年派出医疗队深入牧业区替各民族牧民治疗疾病，仅在五月至十一月的六个月中共初诊梅毒、风湿病、肠胃病、皮肤病患者即达六万三千零一十八人，复诊四万一千二百六十九人。内蒙古自治区已将牧业区人民的性病普遍治疗了一遍，很多地区性病已经根治，牧业区人口已开始有兴旺气象，并给畜牧业生产增加了劳动力。现在“人畜两旺”已经成为鼓舞牧业区人民前进，为牧业区人民所衷心拥护的口号。
    （三）发展畜牧业经济的各项政策
    根据发展畜牧业经济的方针和各牧业区的实际情况，内蒙古自治区和上述若干牧业区采取不同的步骤，实施了若干政策，主要的有下列十一项：
    一、在牧业区实行了“不斗不分，不划阶级”与牧工、牧主两利的政策。保存牧主经济、“不斗不分，不划阶级”的政策，是根据牧业区的实际情况与畜牧业经济特点制订的。畜牧业经济是包括牧主经济在内的。牧主经济其经营方式是雇佣劳动，即带有资本主义性质的，牧主经济的发展，就整个新民主主义的国民经济来说，不是有害而是有利的。事实证明，凡是正确执行这一政策的地方畜牧业生产都得到发展，人民生活得到改善。有些地区的领导机关，因为不懂得牧主经济的性质，不懂得牧主经济的发展对发展生产、繁荣经济有利，搬用农业区的办法，曾或先或后地走了弯路，使畜牧业生产遭受了损失。实行牧工、牧主两利政策的重要问题是工资问题。内蒙古各地实行改造旧的“苏鲁克”制度（牧主将畜群交牧民放牧，给牧民极少的生活品）为新的“苏鲁克”制度（牧主将畜群交牧民放牧，牧民根据合理的工资合同得到工资），使得牧民的牲畜得到发展，牧主的牲畜也同样得到发展。如陈巴尔虎旗巴彦哈达苏木哈顿和硕巴嘎，共有中等牧户和贫苦牧户四十五户二百一十九人，一九四八年共有牲畜一千二百一十七头，每人五、六头；到一九五二年的四年中，已发展到四千九百三十五头，增加了三倍多，现每人平均有牲畜二二．六头了。又如新巴左旗牧主毛拉玛，在一九四五年解放时，只有各种牲畜近七百头；到一九五二年的七年中，已发展到二千一百头，增加了整两倍。在贯彻工资政策中，一般采用了两种办法：一种是经过牧工、牧主双方协商订立合同，共同遵守；一种是经过牧工、牧主的代表会议协商，规定出在生产条件相同的一个小的地区的统一的工资标准。各地经验证明，这两种办法都是可行的，执行得好就可作到自愿和两利。工资的标准，据各地经验，由于生产发展与其他具体条件不同，不能强求划一；在开始时一般不宜过高，随着生产的发展，再适当提高到更合理的水平；应达到既能改善牧工生活、提高牧工生产的积极性、又能鼓励牧主经营积极性的目的。在执行工资政策中，有些地区也曾经发生过偏差。一种是规定过高的工资标准，强迫牧主雇工，不准牧主动用和自由买卖牲畜等，这种侵犯牧主私有权的做法是错误的；一种是不保护牧工利益，听任牧主随便降低牧工工资和拖延不付工资，违反合同随便解雇牧工等，这种做法同样也是错误的。这些错误都应继续防止与纠正。
    二、合理地解决草场、牧场问题。目前各牧业区的草场、牧场，有为民族或部落所公有的、个人或寺庙所私有的和民族之间部落之间租用的等情况。草场、牧场为民族公有的内蒙古自治区，实行了放牧自由、调剂牧场的政策。草场、牧场为寺庙和个人所私有的地区（如青海、新疆），采取了从现状出发、照顾历史、照顾全局、同时特别照顾较少数的民族、有利于生产与民族间和民族内部的团结的方针，通过各民族人民代表及与各民族人民有联系的领袖人物协商的办法，调剂草场、牧场，调解各民族间和各民族内部的纠纷。仅青海一省，在解放以来，调解解决的纠纷，即达三千多件。在民族间部落间因租用草场、牧场发生纠纷的地区，则通过协商的办法适当调整租额。这样做，就加强了民族内部与各民族间的团结，初步扫除了牧业区各民族人民发展生产的障碍。
    三、实行扶助畜牧业生产，特别是扶助贫苦牧民生产的政策。由于畜牧业生产过去长期处于衰落下降的状态，因此人民政府曾从各方面予以扶助，如组织物资交流，发放贷款，贷放生产工具和饲料，实行免费的防疫注射等，使畜牧业生产得以迅速恢复和发展。对于贫苦牧民，人民政府采取了从发展生产中来解决牧民困难的方法，并注意纠正了忽视扶助贫苦牧民的错误态度，保障了贫苦牧民的政治权利，教育牧民增强劳动观念，奖励积极生产；会过光景的牧民，并用生产互助、适当调整工资、发放贷款、开展自由借贷、鼓励牧民间的互助互济等办法，扶助其经济上升。解放以来，中央人民政府发给各牧业区的贷款，内蒙古为二百二十二亿，绥远为一百四十四亿。此外对发生灾害的地区，并发放救济款。在发放贷款和救济中，曾帮助贫苦牧民解决缺乏母畜、种畜、打草机、井用木材、帐篷、蒙古包、豆饼、水车等困难。内蒙古自治区一九五○年贷给了呼纳盟陈巴尔虎旗贫苦牧民绵羊七千只，经过一年以后，据调查平均增殖了百分之四十四点九，贷畜户的生产和生活情况普遍得到了改善。
    四、组织工、农、牧业的相互支援，发展牧业区贸易合作事业。畜牧业生产是必须在工业和农业的帮助下，与工业、农业发展相配合才能发展的。解放以来，中央人民政府与内蒙古及绥远、青海、新疆等地人民政府，积极发展了牧业区贸易合作事业，每年供应了牧业区许多粮食，大大地减少了牲畜的消耗；供应了豆饼等饲料，克服了牲畜过冬缺乏饲料等困难；供应了生产工具和生活必需品，克服了生产中和生活中许多困难。牧业区这几年也将大量的牲畜输送到了农业区，供应了农业所需要的耕畜，帮助了农业的发展。同时还以大量的皮毛等工业原料供应了工业生产。内蒙古自治区呼纳盟牧业区一九五二年仅国营贸易公司即输出了牲畜六万八千五百七十七头。青海国营贸易公司在一九五二年收购各种畜皮一百零五万零二百二十八张，肠衣六十八万三千六百条。新疆国营贸易公司在一九五二年收购的各种畜毛一百八十二万五千七百九十斤，各种畜皮一百八十六万六千零五十张。由于牧业区贸易合作事业的开展，减少了不法商人对牧民的超额剥削，使畜牧业产品的价格空前提高了。因此，就大大提高了牧民的购买力，改善了牧民生活。如内蒙古牧业区解放前，牧民的购买力极低，一九五一年每个牧民平均购买力提高到四十三万三千元，一九五二年更增加到五十万零六千元。青海贸易公司的流动组深入牧业区工作后，贵德尖扎区藏民维木藏感激地说：“过去走到贵德，几驮羊毛换一驮茶，今天贸易公司走到帐房，一驮羊毛换一驮茶”。但我们的工作还是有缺点的，有些牧业区粮食运不进去，有些牧业区牲畜和畜产品运不出来，还有畜产品与工、农业产品比价的不合理以及收购畜产品的价格某些偏高的现象，今后应该注意。对于生产尚未恢复、人民生活尚有困难的牧业区，贸易部门应予以照顾，在特殊情况下，即使略有赔累，也应保持供应。应适当帮助牧业区建立集市和一揽子的贸易站，并有计划、有重点地扶助群众组织供销合作社。对于牧业区人民习惯的交易市场（如“那达慕大会”及其他庙会等）应充分利用，并予以扶持。在贸易行政机关与国营贸易企业的领导和组织下，应贯彻公平合理的价格政策，恢复人民之间的商业贸易关系，团结正当私商，反对任何对少数民族人民的欺诈行为。为了交流物资，各地应充分利用牧民中现有的交通工具，并在可能条件下，适当修路，添设新的交通工具。
    五、在半农半牧或农牧交错地区，以发展牧业生产为主，为此采取保护牧场禁止开荒的政策。因为在这些地区不仅是农牧交错，并且大部分是民族杂居，长久存在着农牧生产的矛盾和民族纠纷；现在这些地区交通极为不便，粮食很难外运；其中有许多又是土质与气候不适宜农业的，往往开荒之后，变为轮种地，随开随弃，沙荒增多，既缩小与破坏了牧场，又易酿成风、沙、水、旱灾害，对畜牧业与农业生产都很不利，以致造成农牧民年年勤劳生产，但不能致富的景况；因此现在禁止开荒与划定牧场，就成为极其重要的措施。事实证明：凡是坚决执行这一政策的地区，农牧人民就得到实际利益。据绥远省伊克昭盟一九五二年的材料，一个劳动力一年种一百亩地，约可收四千斤糜子，约可值一百六十万元，但十只羊就可卖二百万元，因此在这些地区发展畜牧业比发展农业更有利于当地人民。但这些地区，农牧关系、民族关系错综复杂，处理时需特别慎重，否则就不能达到加强民族团结、相互发展生产、解决农牧矛盾、解决民族纠纷的目的。其办法，一般的是划定农田、牧场界线，组织农、牧民互助，提倡与鼓励农民兼营畜牧业。对牧场中的小块农业区，可在自愿的原则下逐步引导发展畜牧业生产，如有困难，政府可给以帮助和照顾。对农、牧业生产发展都很适宜的地区，应固定农田、牧场面积，分别发展农业和畜牧业。在解决农牧矛盾与民族纠纷中，必须明确认识这些矛盾与纠纷，虽是历史上民族压迫所造成的，但在今天一般已成为劳动人民间内部的问题，只能采取说服帮助的办法，决不能采取排挤的办法，要照顾全局，特别要照顾少数。这样作的结果，再加上民族间在政治上团结的加强，不但可克服农、牧业生产中的矛盾，发展生产，而且会使农牧矛盾变为农牧互助，历史上遗留下来的民族纠纷也能得到解决。
    六、采取了轻于农业区与城市的税收政策，使牧民得以休养生息。各地在解放初期，照顾到牧业区人民的困难，一定时间内减免了牧业区牧民应向国家缴纳的赋税，在畜牧业生产发展之后，也是实行税率很轻的合理的税收政策。目前各牧业区有的实行了有免征点与累进最高率的超额累进税，有的实行比例税，其税率都是很轻的。牧业税的征收，一般都征收牲畜、皮毛，采用简便的手续。个别牧业区在手续上还不够简便，折合上也有不合理的地方，应该改进。合理的税收政策执行的结果，安定了牧民的生产情绪，有利于生产的发展。
    七、实行了稳步的发展牧民间的互助合作的政策。由于生产发展的需要及牧民间在历史上已有原始的互助习惯，再加上各地党和人民政府的领导，牧业区的互助合作运动在有些地区已经有很大的发展。据现有材料，新疆、青海的牧民中已有打狼、打草、防火和副业生产的临时性的互助组，绥远牧业区和半农半牧区有一千多个季节性的牧业生产互助组和农牧互助组。在内蒙古，各类型的互助组有二千六百多个，计有三种类型：一种是防灾、接羔、打草、打狼、剪毛、走“敖特尔”（到有好水草的地方放牧）和副业生产互助小组，这是在牧业区大量存在的组织，带有一定的季节性；一种是合群放牧互助组，这是牲畜较少的牧民间为节省人力而组织起来的互助组织，在牧业区和半农半牧区这样的互助组织相当普遍；一种是常年的有一定分工和生产计划的较高形式的互助组，此种互助组织在目前还不是大量的。实行劳动互助的结果，解决了牧民劳动力不足、生产工具不足等困难，牧民已得到实际利益。如内蒙古新巴右旗在防灾互助未普遍组织以前的一九四九年的一年中，过冬即死亡牲畜一万二千头，在组织起来防灾互助后的一九五一年的一年中，过冬仅死亡七百头。又如内蒙古呼纳盟陈巴尔虎旗牧民胡和勒泰合作互助组，他们一共四户，有男女劳动力共四个，自己有马三匹，牛三十二头，羊六只，一九五○年人民政府贷给他们羊四百零一只，马二匹。因为实行了互助合作，组内分为放牧组和副业组，并订立合作生产公约，大大地提高了劳动效率，到一九五二年该组的牲畜已发展到一千一百六十四头，打井二眼，建筑畜舍二栋，购买搂草机一架。在推行互助合作中，过去有些地区曾经产生过强迫命令的错误，今后必须坚决防止。牧业区推行互助合作运动，必须从牧民生产的需要出发，绝对遵守自愿互利的原则，采用牧民所最易接受的形式，典型试办，逐步推广。目前提倡的，应该是临时性的季节性的互助组织，对较高级的互助组织，只能在条件具备的地方由领导机关掌握试办，宁可少一些，但要办好，不可贪多冒进，以免妨碍牧业区互助合作运动的进行。
    八、在条件具备的地方提倡定居游牧。各地牧业区，绝大部分是游牧区，也有一部分是定居和定居游牧区。定居与游牧各有好处与缺点。定居对“人旺”好，但因天然牧场、草场产草量有一定限度，对牲畜发展与繁殖不利。游牧能使牲畜经常吃到好草，对牲畜繁殖有好处，但全家老小一年四季随着牲畜搬家，对“人旺”说来极为不利。而定居游牧，在目前的生产条件下，则可以兼顾两者的优点和克服两者的缺点。因此在条件具备的地方提倡定居游牧，一部分人（主要是青壮年）出去游牧，一部分人（包括老弱小孩）在定居地方建设家园，设卫生所、种植牧草、种菜、兴办学校等，并在自愿条件下，逐步将牧民组织起来，进行互助合作，这将可以更好地达到改变牧业区人民的生活面貌和达到人畜两旺的目的。
    九、加强爱国主义教育，开展增畜保畜竞赛运动，培养牧业区的劳动模范，奖励工作干部和技术人员。各地牧业区都注意了结合各种工作向群众进行爱国主义宣传教育的工作。经验证明：这是提高牧民爱国情绪、鼓舞劳动热情、推动生产发展的动力。组织牧业区人民到各地参观，是进行爱国主义教育的很好的方法，能够使他们更认识到祖国的伟大，感觉到祖国的温暖，因而更提高了爱国情绪和劳动热情。牧业区人民的爱国主义和国际主义觉悟的提高，可以从以下的事例说明：如一九五一年在抗美援朝捐献运动中，内蒙古牧民捐献极为踊跃，仅锡林郭勒盟的五万牧民就为志愿军捐集了肉松三万七千余斤和四亿多现款。
    各地在进行爱国主义教育中，都结合着开展增畜保畜竞赛运动。如内蒙古锡林郭勒盟西苏尼特旗牧民，从一九五一年起，在佐与佐间展开争夺红旗的爱国生产竞赛运动，牲畜的纯增殖率迅速地由百分之零点三提高到百分之二十三；在内蒙古、绥远、新疆等牧业区，都开了劳模会议，一般的采用了各种群众集会、进行奖励各种生产能手和劳模、评比优良牲畜、交流生产经验的办法，提高和鼓舞了群众的生产情绪。
    必须结合各种工作经常注意培养劳模和发现各种生产能手，评选时也要慎重，并须经常抓紧思想教育工作。
    因为牧业区工作比较艰苦，各地对于牧业区的技术人员与干部，曾给以适当的表扬与奖励，这样的奖励，对鼓励干部积极努力领导好畜牧业生产，起了良好的作用。但在这方面的工作还作得不够，今后应更加注意。
    十、发展手工业生产和副业生产，适当举办某些与畜牧业生产有密切关系的小型工业。牧业区已经有些小型工业和手工业，如畜产品加工——乳制品、赶毡、熟皮，做车等；有运输、拉盐、挖碱、打猎、捕鱼等副业。发展工业和手工业，对牧业区生产力的发展具有进步的作用和重大的意义。发展副业生产也可以增加牧民的收入，解决贫苦牧民的生活问题。内蒙古自治区锡林郭勒盟一九五二年的副业生产总值为一百五十八亿元。青海牧业区牧民在一九五○年到一九五二年的三年中仅运输一项，收入即达三百四十三亿元。新疆省承化县第四区阿拉哈克牧民二百一十三户组织起来搞副业生产，在一九五二年中挖盐五十吨，挖碱八万斤，捕鱼四十一吨，拾柴三百五十驮，共折合人民币三亿一千二百余万元，每户平均可得一百四十六万六千元。
    十一、建立国营牧场与种畜场。内蒙古自一九四九年起，先后建立了国营牧场五处，为了改良马种，并建立了五所配种站。绥远牧业区也建立了国营牧场。国营牧场是社会主义性质的经济，对畜牧业生产发展有极大的重要性。其任务是：吸收牧民好的牧养经验，逐步引用科学方法改良品种，改善饲养管理方法，提高牲畜繁殖率与成活率，在发展畜牧业生产上给牧民以示范作用。对于国营牧场，应坚决贯彻“只许办好、不许办坏”的方针。目前已建立国营牧场的地方，有些办的不好，其原因主要是领导机关和国营牧场负责人还不认识国营牧场的重要意义，对牧场的领导和经营，采取了官僚主义的态度。今后必须克服这种错误，改进经营管理方法，加强政治领导。
    （四）发展畜牧业生产的各种具体措施
    为了贯彻执行上述政策，各地在畜牧业生产上采取了如下的具体措施：
    一、保护培育草原，划分与合理使用牧场、草场。各地牧业区，面积广大、水草丰美的牧场很多，但是由于过去反动统治阶级乱牧、抢牧、滥垦的结果，使许多草场、牧场遭受破坏，对畜牧业生产极为不利。因此，各地对草场、牧场的管理和使用，都曾采取过一些有效措施。在青海牧业区实行了划分四季牧场，轮流放牧，打井引水，并在划定的牧场地区建立了草原管理委员会。青海贵德县藏族独秀部落，不但把六十七万五千亩草原划出四季草场，而且从各季草场中心，再划出四块到六块小草场，把牛、马、羊分群，循环轮流放牧（宁夏、甘肃等草场较坏的地区，有的实行划界封滩育草，延迟放牧的方法）。在绥远牧业区，为了解决缺水困难，组织群众打新井和修复旧井共达三千多眼。在内蒙古牧业区普遍地划分了四季牧场和打草场，个别地方实行了小块牧场灌溉，重点组织牧民打井和推行水车，严格实行防火制度。内蒙古牧业区仅一九五一年即打新井二千二百五十眼，修复旧井二千二百七十眼。为了解决过冬过春草场、牧场不足的困难，呼纳盟在一九五一年过冬过春时，组织了有经验的牧民勘察四个旗过冬的牧场，调剂解决了一百一十四万头牲畜的过冬的牧场问题，使牲畜因历年草场不足而瘦弱死亡的情形大大减少。在半农半牧区提倡农作物和牧草轮种，和在牧业区提倡种植牧草、选取优良草种、培植人工草场是有意义的。采取这些方法的结果，可使草原繁茂，减少牲畜寄生虫的繁殖，改善饲料质量，提高草场、牧场利用率，解决草场、牧场不足的困难。
    二、搭棚、盖圈、储草、防止风雪灾害。各地都采取了发动牧民搭盖圈棚，改善环境卫生，准备饲料，储备冬草等改善牲畜饲养管理的办法。内蒙古昭乌达盟搭圈棚达四万余个；绥远牧业区搭圈棚达一万五千一百九十一个；新疆牧业区一九五二年搭圈棚四万七千四百多个；青海牧业区十四个县一九五二年搭盖棚圈共五千三百五十七个。内蒙古牧业区一九五二年秋季打草十九亿四千三百五十四万斤；新疆牧业区一九五二年一年打草二十一亿八千四百余万斤，若每月每只羊补助八十斤冬草，可解决九百一十余万只羊三个月的冬草。搭盖棚圈和储草的结果，克服了牧业区因冬、春二季气候严寒，缺乏足够的饲料及保温设备的困难。
    提倡改进放牧方法，在防止风雪灾害方面也收到了显著的成绩。如内蒙古呼纳盟牧业区由于统一调剂牧场和一九五○年走“敖特尔”秋膘抓得好，一九五一年各种牲畜繁殖率平均达到百分之八十六，其中绵羊下双羔的空前增多，约占母羊的百分之十五左右。牧民过去认为冬春两季死牲畜是不可避免的事，现在已开始相信“人定胜天”了。
    三、扑灭狼害及其他兽害。牧业区的狼害，仅次于牲畜传染病害，严重地影响着畜牧业的发展。据内蒙古的不完全统计，牧业区解放以前，每年被狼伤害的牲畜平均都在五万头以上。因此，内蒙古自治区人民政府几年来极重视打狼工作，积极发动与组织群众进行定期与经常性的打狼运动。据不完全统计，由一九四八年到一九五二年，共打大小狼四万余只。其他各牧业区也都重视打狼工作，绥远省三年来打狼一万三千余只；新疆牧业区一九五二年打狼二千三百三十只；青海牧业区三个县在一九五二年打狼二百四十多只。因此，各牧业区狼害大大减少了。其他兽害（如鼠害）在有些地区也已在注意防止。
    四、组织定期交配，大群分群放牧、拨群接羔，小群合群放牧、互助接羔。过去牧民养羊，公母向不分群，交配无定期，因此产羔时间拖得很长，冬春两季随时随地产羔，顾此失彼，损失很大。内蒙古有些牧业区人民政府，已在领导牧民实行公母分群放牧，定期合群交配，把产羔期间控制在春季清明前后约三十天内，到时牧民均可找到能防风雪的春营地，集中力量进行接羔。由于各户幼畜数量与劳动力多寡不同，又提出了在自愿互利原则下进行拨群接羔办法，把牲畜多的牧户的羊拨给有剩余劳动力的牧户代为接羔，并规定合理报酬。牲畜少的牧户则采取合群放牧互助接羔的办法。这些办法为广大牧民所接受，大大提高了幼畜成活率。一九五二年春季，呼纳盟新巴右旗的牧民实行这一办法，该旗羊羔成活率平均达到百分之九十五。
    五、改良品种。各地牧业区采取了选育本地良种与推广外来良种相结合的办法来逐渐改良品种。有几个牧业区曾发布从各方面奖励优良种公畜的办法（如内蒙古为解决种公畜不足困难，在一九五二年以前曾规定种公畜免税），青海、新疆牧业区曾辅导牧民选定种公畜进行育种，还采取了劣种“去势”（即“阉割”）的办法。各牧业区都开始采用人工授精法，推广了若干优良品种，如兰哈羊、焉耆马（新疆）、三河马（内蒙）等。此外，内蒙古的经验使种公畜与母畜保持一定的比例（如马牛一比十五，羊一比三十五，驼一比十），畜群保持一定的数目（如马二百五十至三百，牛一百五十至二百，羊三百至五百，驼三十至五十），也对增殖牲畜、改良品种有很大好处。
    六、防治牲畜疫病。各牧业区都强调了改进饲养管理、增进牲畜体质以防止疫病，普遍开展了以预防为主、治疗为辅的兽疫防治工作。内蒙古自治区到一九五二年时，各旗、县、市已建立了四十个防疫站，在疫情比较严重的牧业区，则普遍组织了群众性的基层防疫组织。以前长期存在于内蒙古各地的几种主要的牲畜疫病，如牛瘟、炭疽、口蹄疫、疥癣等都得到防治。如牛瘟曾是内蒙古牧业区危害最大的一种传染病，根据一九四二年东部四盟关于牛瘟的统计，患病达一万零六百九十头，死亡达三千三百八十三头，解放后由于采取了封锁疫区，施行血清防治和非疫区进行普遍预防注射的防治办法，牛瘟已显著减少，现在已基本上扑灭。根据新疆省一九五零年统计，全省各专区都已设有兽医院，另外，还有一个血清厂和三十六个防治站，仅一九五二年，治疗及预防注射各种牲畜二百一十七万余头。青海省牧业区三年来防治各种牲畜六十余万头。新疆、青海已基本控制了牛瘟，基本消灭了口蹄疫，其他如炭疽内外寄生虫等主要疫病也得到普遍防治。在开展防疫工作中，除了积极设法训练
    一批干部外，并与群众一起想办法，吸取群众中的技术人材，推广群众中的固有经验，团结和改造当地兽医人员，解决了技术干部不足的困难。
    （五）关于今后工作的意见
    目前全国的经济建设正在开展，牧业区的畜牧业生产是全国经济建设的一部分，因此今后牧业区的中心工作任务，就是要适应全国经济建设的需要，增加牲畜数量，提高牲畜质量，增加牲畜产品，发展畜牧业经济。
    为了完成发展畜牧业经济的任务，上述地区必须继续贯彻执行各牧业区现在已经推行有效的各种方针、政策。这些方针、政策，对各个牧业区都是基本上适用的，但现在有些牧业区还没有全部实施。经验证明：凡是正确执行这些方针、政策的地方，畜牧业就得到发展，凡是违反这些方针、政策的地方，工作就不免犯错误，畜牧业经济就会遭受损失。但各牧业区在实施这些方针、政策时，必须从本地区的实际情况出发，有步骤地就生产的需要与可能逐步地实施。
    一般的说，在解放时间较早，工作基础较巩固，生产已有发展的地区，该区现在执行的各项政策应该继续贯彻。内蒙古自治区应着重贯彻牧工牧主两利政策，有领导有步骤地提倡和组织畜牧业生产中的互助合作，在有条件的地区提倡定居游牧
    （已定居的地区提倡定居轮牧与种植牧草），逐渐实行科学的管理方法，加强对国营牧场的领导，以逐步改变牧业区的落后状态。
    在社会秩序已经安定，工作已有一定基础，畜牧业生产已经恢复的地区，应继续贯彻“不斗不分，不划阶级”的政策，在实际情况可以推行的地区经过典型试验，推行牧工、牧主两利政策，巩固生产情绪，开展医疗、贸易等工作。根据生产发展的需要和可能并在群众自愿的原则下，进行某些有利于畜牧业发展的措施，达到人畜两旺、增畜保畜的目的。定居游牧等政策在这类地区则暂时不要提倡；生产互助也只宜于先总结群众中的固有经验，个别地进行试验。
    在工作虽有初步开展，但生产还是处于恢复时期的地区，则主要的应是广泛宣传“不斗不分，不划阶级”及其他有关政策，安定生产情绪，进行医疗、贸易工作及有关恢复畜牧业生产的一些必要与可能的措施，以逐步奠定发展畜牧业生产的基础，其他工作如条件不具备，暂可不举行。
    牧业区的领导机关和工作干部必须学习有关牧业区的各项政策，学习畜牧业生产的知识，并把现在应该在本区实行的政策和生产知识向各民族人民进行广泛的宣传教育。
    在内蒙古自治区及绥远、青海、新疆等地以外的牧业区和青海、新疆等地还有些牧业区应否实行和应在什么时候、采取什么步骤实行这些政策和具体措施，必须根据那些地区的实际情况和具体条件来决定。切不可因为它是好的，而不顾情况和条件勉强去作，也不可因为有一两条是可以作的，而不加区别地件件都作。
    畜牧业生产是有光明前途的，过去工作的成绩是很大的，并将继续获得更大的成绩。但今后工作中的困难也会是很多的，缺点和错误还不免会发生。为了发展牧业区经济，改善人民生活，建设我们伟大的祖国，一切牧业区工作的干部和各民族人民，都应该更加努力工作，努力生产，克服困难，争取更大的成就，完成自己光荣的任务。
