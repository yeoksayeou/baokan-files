    A Black Market Transaction
    Li Gao
    America's "Life" magazine once compared France to a prostitute who spends American money. When Wall Street bosses' arms deals don't go smoothly, they often lose their temper with her. This time, after the UN General Assembly discussed the composition of the political conference on Korea, the American bosses took it out on "Miss Marianne" again. The Scripps-Howard newspaper group, the mouthpiece of American monopoly capitalists, published an editorial on August 28, criticizing France for "standing idly by" when the UN General Assembly's Political Committee voted on the proposal for India to participate in the political conference, daring to "abstain" instead of following the United States in voting against it. The editorial argued that France had become a "stone" in America's arms. It said that we had spent so much money on France, "but when we need France, they are nowhere to be found. Then shall we continue to hold this stone until it sinks us?"
    Why are the American bosses so angry? Aren't they publicizing America's "victory" in this UN General Assembly? Indeed, America has "won" this time—"won" to the point of almost becoming a "lone wolf." As the "Indian Times" put it well: "America's victory shows that it has separated itself from its European allies and Asian countries and has fallen into complete isolation." Regarding America's unprecedented state of isolation, the "New York Post" quoted the opinions of so-called "sober observers in the United Nations" as saying: "The United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Lodge, is personally presiding over the destruction of America's powerful position in the United Nations," watching the power of the American delegation "decline in a straight line to the lowest level in the history of the United Nations." The Scripps-Howard newspaper group also believes that this UN vote "provides some ominous signs that we (the United States) are losing ground in the Cold War." This has forced the American bosses to fly into a rage.
    Why did the Scripps-Howard newspaper group first direct its anger at France? In the UN General Assembly Political Committee, the only ones who followed the United States in opposing India's participation in the Korean political conference were a group of Latin American lackeys, plus Greece and the Kuomintang corpse from Taiwan. Even America's number one sidekick, Britain, voted in favor. France only "abstained," so why was it the first to be scolded? The reason is that the United States and France engaged in a dirty political deal behind the scenes this time. The United States discovered that it had lost money in this deal. Originally, France's position on the issue of India's participation in the Korean political conference was contrary to that of the United States. However, due to its barbaric aggression against Morocco and the expulsion of Sultan Sidi Mohammed ben Youssef, Asian and Arab countries were preparing to bring this issue to the United Nations for discussion. Therefore, France asked the United States to support it in preventing the United Nations from discussing the Moroccan issue. The Wall Street bosses, full of business acumen, immediately demanded that France support the United States on the issue of the composition of the Korean political conference in exchange. This black market transaction was completed. However, this collusion in political conspiracy aroused further opposition from Asian and Arab countries to the US-British bloc. The Associated Press reported on August 26: "The attitude of the United States and Britain on the Moroccan issue (actually refusing to allow the Security Council to discuss France's policies) has aroused strong anti-Western sentiment throughout the Arab world. ...Even the newspapers of tiny Outer Jordan expressed the public's indignation and launched a campaign against France, Britain, and the United States." In this way, the United States became even more isolated. Therefore, the Scripps-Howard newspaper group believes that the United States "foolishly acted as France's puppet" and blamed France for reneging on the deal. It wrote: "Our government supported France in the Moroccan case, and we lost the Islamic countries group. However, France did not support us on the India issue. They abstained in the vote."
    There is a Chinese saying: "When the Bodhisattva is no longer effective, the temple is already old; if you repair the east wall, the west building will collapse." This is a true reflection of the current US foreign policy.

    一桩黑市交易
    李高
    美国“生活”杂志曾经把法国比成一个花美国钱的妓女。华尔街老板们在军火生意做得不顺心的时候常常对她大发脾气。这回联合国大会讨论关于朝鲜政治会议的组成问题以后，美国老板又拿这位“马利安娜小姐”来泄气了。美国垄断资本家的报纸——斯克里浦斯—霍华德系报纸在八月二十八日发表了一篇社论，斥责法国在联大政治委员会表决关于印度参加政治会议的提案时“袖手旁观”，不跟着美国投反对票而敢于“弃权”。这篇社论认为法国简直成了美国怀里抱着的一块“石头”。它说，我们对法国花了这么大的本钱，“然而当我们需要法国时，他们就不知道那里去了。那么我们还要继续抱着这块石头，直至它使我们沉下去时为止吗？”
    美国老板们为什么这样起火呢？他们不是正宣传美国在这次联合国大会中的“胜利”吗？的确，美国这次是“胜利”了——“胜利”得使自己快要变成“孤家寡人”了。“印度时报”说得好：“美国的胜利说明它已脱离了它的欧洲盟国以及亚洲国家，陷于完全孤立的状态。”对于美国这种空前的孤立状态，“纽约邮报”引所谓“联合国中头脑清醒的观察家”的意见说：“美国驻联合国代表洛奇正在亲自主持断送美国在联合国中的有力地位”，眼看着美国代表团的势力“直线下降到联合国历史上最低的程度”。斯克里浦斯—霍华德系报纸也认为：联合国的这次表决“提供了一些不祥的迹象，说明我们（美国）在冷战中失势了。”这就使得美国老板们不得不暴跳如雷起来。
    斯克里浦斯—霍华德系报纸为什么又首先向法国发火呢？在联大政治委员会上跟着美国反对印度参加朝鲜政治会议的，只有一群拉丁美洲的小喽罗，外加希腊和台湾的国民党僵尸。连美国的第一个伙计英国也投了赞成票。法国只不过“弃权”而已，为什么首先挨骂呢？原因是美国和法国这回在幕后做了一桩肮脏的政治买卖。美国发现在这场买卖中折了本。本来，法国对印度参加朝鲜政治会议问题的主张，原是和美国相反的。但是，由于它对摩洛哥的野蛮侵略和驱逐素勒檀西迪·穆罕默德·本·优素福的事件，亚洲、阿拉伯各国准备把这个问题提到联合国去讨论。于是法国就要求美国支持它阻挠联合国讨论摩洛哥问题。满身生意经的华尔街老板马上要法国以在朝鲜政治会议的组成问题上支持美国为交换条件。这场黑市交易就此做成了。但是，这种狼狈为奸的政治阴谋，引起了亚洲、阿拉伯各国对美英集团进一步的反对。美联社八月二十六日报道说：“美国和英国在摩洛哥问题上所持的态度（实际上是拒绝让安全理事会讨论法国的政策）已引起了整个阿拉伯世界的强烈反对西方的情绪。……甚至小小的外约旦的报纸也表达了民众的愤慨情绪，发动了反对法国、英国和美国的运动。”这样，美国就更加陷于孤立了。因此，斯克里浦斯—霍华德系报纸认为美国是“愚笨地作了法国的傀儡”，而且责怪法国赖账。它写道：“我们政府在摩洛哥案件上支持了法国，我们便失去了回教国家集团。然而，法国在印度问题上并没有支持我们。他们在投票时弃权。”
    中国有一句俗话：“菩萨不灵庙已旧，堵好东墙垮西楼。”这正是当前美国外交政策的写照。
