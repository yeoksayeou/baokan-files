Xinhua News Agency: A campaign to increase production and practice economy amongst the national state-owned coal mines to strive for comprehensive overfulfillment of state plans has been fully launched. Currently, the Coal Mine Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government and the National Committee of the Coal Miners' Union of China have proposed a plan to increase coal production by 810,000 tons and save 169 billion yuan on top of fulfilling the annual state plan. Mining bureaus in Fushun, Fuxin, Hegang, Kailuan, Datong, Huainan, and Jingxi have all formulated specific plans for increasing production and practicing economy based on the different conditions of each mine. Because these plans fully tapped the production potential of each mine, the plans formulated are generally higher than those proposed by the General Bureau. The Fushun Mining Bureau alone has drafted a plan to increase coal production by 400,000 tons and save 120 billion yuan for the year. Other mining bureaus such as Xi'an, Benxi, Jixi, Fengfeng, and Pingxiang have also successively launched increase production and practice economy campaigns, studying and formulating increase production and practice economy plans.

At the same time as formulating increase production and practice economy plans, most units have formulated specific measures to ensure the completion of the plans. For example, the Datong Mining Bureau plans to further implement work plans and strengthen technical management from September to mid-December, open up new coal extraction and tunneling work surfaces by tapping the potential of machinery, and promote existing advanced experiences to increase the output of medium and thick coal seam extraction work surfaces to achieve the goal of increasing production. They also plan to continue to reduce the amount of stone in the coal and increase the production of large lump coal to improve the quality of the coal; reduce costs by eliminating waste of major materials such as explosives, detonators, and timber in certain mines, and by saving on management expenses. Kailuan Coal Mine has proposed to promote the Soviet Union's advanced experience in planning management, and to promote Ma Liuhai's multi-hole circular operation method in tunneling, among other methods.

Currently, many coal mine workers have achieved results in the increase production and practice economy campaign. In the first and middle ten days of September, the transportation system workers of the Haizhou Open-Pit Coal Mine of the Fuxin Mining Bureau have already found and proposed more than 180 rationalization proposals and tricks. The trick of having each electric locomotive pull one more self-tipping car alone can save the country five locomotives and forty-eight self-tipping cars. From September 1st to 18th, the coal miners of the Huainan Mining Bureau had already overfulfilled the cumulative daily output plan by 5%; the drilling workers completed all of their September tasks on September 16th. After formulating a plan to increase production and save more than 118 million yuan for the country in September, the Lian Wanlu and Ma Liuhai rapid tunneling teams of the Datong Mining Bureau initiated a friendly competition with tunneling teams across the country to advance 700 meters per month and strive for 750 meters. The Cui Guoshan tunneling team of the Jixi Coal Mine also proposed a competition to all tunneling teams in the Northeast region to advance 500 meters per month.

### 全国国营煤矿展开增产节约竞赛

    全国国营煤矿展开增产节约竞赛
    据新华社讯：全国国营煤矿争取全面超额完成国家计划的增产节约竞赛已全面展开。目前，中央人民政府燃料工业部煤矿管理局和中国煤矿工会全国委员会已提出要在完成全年国家计划的基础上再增产八十一万吨煤炭、节约一千六百九十亿元的计划，抚顺、阜新、鹤岗、开滦、大同、淮南、京西等矿务局都已根据各矿的不同情况，订出了具体的增产节约计划。这些计划由于各矿务局充分挖掘了生产潜力，因此所订计划一般的比总局提出的计划要高，仅抚顺矿务局一个单位就拟订了全年增产四十万吨煤，节约一千二百亿元的计划。其他如西安、本溪、鸡西、峰峰、萍乡等矿务局也都先后展开增产节约竞赛，研究制订增产节约计划。
    各矿务局在制订增产节约计划的同时，大部分单位都订出了保证完成计划的具体措施。如大同矿务局准备在九月到十二月中，以进一步贯彻作业计划和加强技术管理，从发挥机械潜力中增辟新的回采工作面和掘进工作面，推广已有的先进经验，以提高中厚煤层回采工作面的产量等办法，达到增加生产的目的。他们还计划继续减少煤里面带的石头和增加大块煤的产量来提高煤的质量；以消灭若干矿井中炸药、雷管、木材等主要材料的浪费以及节省管理费用的办法，来降低成本。开滦煤矿提出要推广苏联关于计划管理方面的先进经验，在掘进方面要推广马六孩的多孔道循环作业法等办法。
    目前，许多煤矿的职工在增产节约竞赛中获得了成绩。阜新矿务局海州露天煤矿运输系统职工在九月上、中旬的竞赛中，已经找到和提出一百八十多个合理化建议和窍门，其中仅一台电机车多拉一节自翻车箱的窍门，就可以为国家节省五台机车和四十八节自翻车箱。淮南矿务局煤矿工人在九月一日到十八日中，已超额百分之五完成了日产量的累计计划；钻探工人在九月十六日就完成了九月份的全部任务。大同矿务局连万禄、马六孩快速掘进组在订出九月份为国家增产节约一亿一千八百多万元的计划后，向全国煤矿的掘进组发起月进七百公尺争取七百五十公尺的友谊竞赛。鸡西煤矿崔国山掘进组也向东北区煤矿所有掘进组提出了月进五百公尺的竞赛。
