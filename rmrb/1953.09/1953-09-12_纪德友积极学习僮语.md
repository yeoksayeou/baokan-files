    Ji Deyou Actively Learns Zhuang Language
    Reader Ji Deyou writes: I am a Mongolian cadre who learned Chinese later in life. In 1949, I went south with the army and was assigned to work in Huanjiang County, Guangxi Province. The first difficulty I encountered upon arriving was not understanding the local Zhuang language, which prevented me from communicating with the masses, hindering my work. I once had thoughts of not wanting to work here. Later, taking advantage of the land reform, I lived in a poor peasant's home for four months and finally learned the Zhuang language to a basic level.
    My process of learning the Zhuang language was also a process of overcoming the idea of not being content to work in ethnic minority areas. Before learning the Zhuang language, I first criticized my personal plans and resolved to work in ethnic minority areas for a long time. I also decided to live with a Zhuang compatriot's family and humbly learn from them. When I started learning the Zhuang language, I would use each sentence I learned in practical life. Because my pronunciation was incorrect, I was often ridiculed, which made me not want to continue learning. But when I thought of the difficulties of the 25,000-mile Long March, I gained courage again. When I was busy with work, I would forget the Zhuang language I had learned, and progress was very slow, so I didn't want to learn anymore. But when I calmly thought about it again, the thought of "settling down to work in the Zhuang area" strengthened my confidence in learning. Gradually, I figured out a set of learning methods: ask frequently when I don't understand; record the Zhuang language I learned in a notebook, often review it, and often practice speaking it; after studying for a period of time, summarize the experience and correct the shortcomings in learning.
    Now, I have basically learned the Zhuang language. But I am not proud at all, and I will continue to work hard to learn the Zhuang language well and serve the ethnic minorities better.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    纪德友积极学习僮语
    读者纪德友来信：我是一个蒙族干部，后来才学会汉语。一九四九年我随军南下，被分配到广西省环江县工作。到这里以后，碰到的第一个困难就是不懂当地的僮语，和群众互不通语言，以致工作不能深入。我曾经有过不愿在这里工作的想法。后来趁着搞土地改革，我在一个贫农家里住了四个月，终于基本上学会了僮语。
    我学僮语的过程，也是克服不安心在兄弟民族地区工作的思想斗争过程。学僮语以前，我首先批判了个人打算，下决心长期在兄弟民族地区工作下去，自己并决定住到一僮胞家里，虚心向他们学习。开始学习僮语时，我学会一句便在实际生活中用一句。因为我发音不正确，时常受到别人讽刺嘲笑，这时我又产生了不愿学下去的想法。但当我想到两万五千里长征的困难时，就又有了勇气。我工作忙时，把学会的僮语忘了，进步很慢，心里又想不学了。但是自己平静地再想一下，“安心在僮族地区工作”的念头又增强了我的学习信心。慢慢地我摸出了一套学习办法：不懂的勤问；把学来的僮语记在笔记本上，时常翻阅，也时常练习说；学过一个时期后总结一下经验，纠正学习中的缺点。
    现在，我已经基本上学会僮语。但我绝不骄傲，一定继续努力把僮语学好，更好地为兄弟民族服务。
