Universal suffrage work is gradually unfolding in various national minority areas across the country, with people of all ethnic groups enthusiastically participating in the election activities.

In the Northwest region, Xinjiang, Gansu, Qinghai, and other provinces have successively selected areas to carry out trial universal suffrage work. Gansu Province completed trial work in Xiji and Gucheng townships in Linxia County, where Hui, Dongxiang, and other ethnic groups live together, as early as the end of June. Xinjiang Province is conducting trial universal suffrage work in agricultural areas, semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, and pastoral areas. Among them, the trial work in three townships of the three counties including Turpan, directly led by the Provincial Election Committee, has been completed. Ningxia Province started universal suffrage work in the Alxa League and Ejina League Mongolian Autonomous Regions in pastoral areas in June and July respectively.

In the Southwest region, the grassroots election work in Xikang Province has completed the first batch of grassroots elections in two hundred and twenty-four townships of twenty-one counties throughout the province. Tibetan and Yi people living in these areas have enthusiastically participated in the elections. Guizhou Province has completed trial universal suffrage work in one city and seventy-nine counties with mixed ethnic populations, and the first phase of grassroots elections has been launched successively. The Kaili District of the Miao Autonomous Region in Lushan County began the first phase of grassroots elections in eight townships in mid-July.

In the Central South region, the trial work in the Damiaoshan Miao Autonomous Region of Guangxi Province and the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region of Guangdong Province has been completed successively. The Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region of Hunan Province has conducted trial work in eleven townships, and people's congresses have been convened in seven townships. Currently, more than eighty townships in the five counties of Dongfang and Baisha in the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region are widely carrying out population surveys and voter registration.

In the vast land of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, twenty-three banners, seven counties, and four cities have conducted trial universal suffrage work. Since the beginning of August, twenty-one banners and counties in the agricultural and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral banners and counties of the entire region have started the first batch of grassroots elections. Three Nutuks (districts) in the Oroqen Autonomous Banner and six banners in the pastoral areas of the Xilin Gol League and the Chahar League have also started. Twenty-six banners and counties in Suiyuan Province have started trial universal suffrage work. The Guihua City Hui Autonomous Region is conducting population surveys and voter registration.

In the Northeast region, the grassroots election work in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Region of Jilin Province is unfolding in a step-by-step manner. Currently, voters of Korean, Han, Hui, and Mongolian ethnicities in the first batch of one hundred and sixty-six villages and twelve streets undergoing elections are nominating candidates; population surveys and voter registration have also been conducted in the second batch of one hundred and twenty-six villages and eight streets and other electoral districts.

Before carrying out trial universal suffrage work or launching grassroots elections, all localities made full preparations. People of all ethnic groups enthusiastically participated in the universal suffrage. Before the universal suffrage work was launched in various places, detailed plans were formulated according to the different conditions of each region, and a large number of minority ethnic cadres were trained. As early as May, Guizhou Province gathered more than two hundred and thirty cadres from Miao, Yi, Buyi, and other ethnic minorities to study at the Guizhou Nationalities Institute. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, in order to adapt to the situation of vast and dispersed areas, drew cadres of all ethnic groups from all aspects for training, totaling more than six thousand six hundred and thirty people. Cadres of all ethnic groups have played a good role in the election work. In the universal suffrage propaganda work in the Damiaoshan Miao Autonomous Region of Guangxi Province, cadres of all ethnic groups compiled the content of the universal suffrage documents into Miao mountain songs and sang them at any time, which was very effective. In the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Region of Jilin Province, more than two thousand five hundred Korean cadres were trained to participate in the universal suffrage work. They led people of all ethnic groups to closely integrate with production and carry out universal suffrage activities in a step-by-step manner. During the election process, the township election committees in Xikang Province organized farmers of all ethnic groups in the mountainous areas to hunt and protect crops from wild animals. In pastoral areas, cadres of all ethnic groups also carried out work in conjunction with pastoral production, which was well received by herders. In the Ulanqab League Autonomous Region of Suiyuan Province and the Alxa League and Ejina League Mongolian Autonomous Regions of Ningxia Province, universal suffrage was conducted in conjunction with the autumn fattening of livestock. Cadres also used temple fairs and other opportunities to conduct extensive publicity to herders, and also helped them carry water and clean up pens. More than seven hundred herders in a Gacha (village) in the Ulanqab League of Suiyuan Province realized the great significance of universal suffrage. A Mongolian woman named Meidema said: We must elect people who truly work for us.

People of all ethnic groups in various places regard election day as the most meaningful day. They put on brand-new national costumes and participate in the elections with the joyful mood of participating in festivals. Kazakh herders in Nanshan Pastoral Township, Dihua, Xinjiang, dressed in new clothes and rode horses from the grassland to the electoral district to vote. 93.1% of the voters cast their votes. Buyi women in Guizhou Province also put on their favorite embroidered "Baige clothes" to participate in the elections. After people of all ethnic groups elected the people's representatives they trusted most at the township people's congress, they played the best instruments of their ethnic groups and sang the best ethnic songs and dances to celebrate the victory of the universal suffrage.
