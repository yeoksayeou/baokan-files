The reconstruction and expansion work of major factories and mines in Southwest China has achieved remarkable results over the past three years. The restoration and reconstruction of some factories and mines have been basically completed; the reconstruction and expansion of some factories and mines are actively underway. The appearance of many enterprises has been completely renewed.

The foundation of major factories and mines in Southwest China was generally very weak; the production equipment was also very unbalanced and unreasonable. The machinery industry had only a few repair shops, which could only do some small-scale repair and processing work. Many semi-finished products, and even parts, had to rely on outside sources. The equipment capacity of the iron and steel industry in iron smelting, steelmaking, and steel rolling was unbalanced, making independent production impossible. The working and living conditions of workers were extremely poor.

In order to change the backward appearance of these factories and mines, the state has invested huge funds in these old enterprises over the past three years. Judging from the basic construction investment of various factories and mines directly under the former Southwest Industrial Department and those managed on behalf of the central government, the investment amount has increased year by year. If 1950 is taken as 100, then 1951 increased to 219.5, and 1952 increased to 374.4. Among them, the basic construction funds invested in the coal mining industry increased nearly twelve times in three years; the investment in the textile industry also increased more than nine times; the basic construction funds invested in Factory 101 have reached 98.32 percent of the total original fixed assets of the factory at the time of takeover.

After several years of vigorous restoration, reconstruction, and expansion, the equipment capacity of many major enterprises has gradually become balanced, and due to the workers' enthusiasm, the production capacity and product quality have been greatly improved, while the cost has been relatively reduced. The original rolling mill of Factory 101 had insufficient power equipment and could not simultaneously roll steel rails and other steel products urgently needed by the country. In 1951, a certain 1,000-horsepower steam engine was restored, increasing the power equipment capacity by more than double, which increased the output of steel rails by 47 percent and ensured that the country could obtain tens of thousands of tons of various steel products every year. The factory's two newly built open-hearth furnaces have been basically installed. After appropriately increasing the iron smelting equipment and putting them into operation, the factory's production capacity of iron smelting, steelmaking, and steel rolling will be balanced, thereby changing the unreasonable phenomenon of relying on long-distance supply of steel billets from outside areas. Chongqing Machine Tool Factory was originally just a small automobile repair shop, but now it has various latest Soviet machines such as vertical lathes, surface magnetic grinders, and Model 532 machine tools, and has begun to trial-produce machine tools. The former Guizhou Machinery Factory was merged from several small factories in the past and mainly did repair work. It has now been changed to Guiyang Mining Machinery Factory. Factory 204, which used to specialize in repairing motors, will be changed to Kunming Electric Motor Factory, specializing in the manufacture of generators and transformers. The remaining factories have also gradually moved towards independent production and will carry out production division according to product categories such as gear machinery, power machinery, agricultural machinery, and construction machinery, and develop in the direction of specialization. The reconstruction work has also corrected the blind factory construction phenomenon during the past reactionary ruling era. For example, the No. 615 Yarn Factory, originally located in Guizhou, had to transport raw cotton from Chongqing and Guangxi separately. In June of this year, it moved to Chongqing and merged with Yuhua Yarn Factory, thus making the technical equipment more concentrated and production management more strengthened.

The reconstruction and expansion projects have further improved the production equipment level of factories and mines and promoted the gradual automation and mechanization of production. The aerial ropeway project of Yunnan Tin Company, which is sixteen kilometers long in this year's basic construction, has automatic loading and unloading buckets; the new concentrator project has automatic scrapers and conveyor belts; the thermal power plant also has automatic coal loading equipment and controllers. Several hundred pneumatic tools such as air drills and air picks have been added to four mines including No. 401 in the coal mining industry this year. The original No. 401 mine used steam power for mine drainage and coal lifting. After the completion of a certain 1,000-kilowatt power plant built this year, electricity has begun to be used for drainage and coal lifting, greatly reducing the underground temperature and providing power conditions for the future mechanization of coal mining in the mine.

The reconstruction and expansion projects have also played a significant role in improving the working and living conditions of workers. Four mines including No. 405 Coal Mine have added a number of air compressors, exhaust fans, and a fan to the ventilation equipment this year. Investment in ventilation and cooling projects in the textile industry accounts for 12.8 percent of the total basic construction investment. The main workshops of fine yarn, roving, steel wire, and cotton cleaning in factories 610 and 612 have all been equipped with roof sprinkler and exhaust fan equipment. Factories 610's fine yarn, roving, and steel wire workshops renovated the roofs this year, added insulation equipment, and installed elastic floors on all the original cement floors. In recent years, the construction area of various factory and mining enterprises for reconstruction and expansion has been very large. Factory 101 has newly built factory buildings, warehouses, and staff dormitories with a total construction area of 45,000 square meters in three years, of which staff dormitories account for 60 percent, which has solved the accommodation problem for nearly 7,000 people.

    西南主要厂矿进行改建扩建工作
    逐步改变企业落后面貌发挥生产潜力
    西南各主要厂矿的改建与扩建工作三年多来，已取得显著成绩。部分厂矿的恢复、改建工作已基本完成；部分厂矿的改建、扩建工作正在积极进行。许多企业的面貌已焕然一新。
    西南各主要厂矿的基础一般都非常薄弱；生产设备也很不平衡、很不合理。机械工业只有少数的修配厂，只能做些小型的修配与加工工作，许多半成品，甚至零件都要依靠外来。钢铁工业的炼铁、炼钢及轧钢的设备能力互不平衡，无法进行独立生产。工人的劳动条件与生活条件更是极其恶劣。
    为改变这些厂矿的落后面貌，三年多来，国家对这些旧企业投入了巨大的资金。从原西南工业部直辖及代管中央各厂矿的基本建设投资情况看，投资数历年都有增加。如以一九五零年为一百，则一九五一年增为二百一十九点五，一九五二年又增为三百七十四点四。其中，投入煤矿工业的基本建设资金，三年中增加了将近十二倍；投入纺织工业的也增加了九倍多；投入一零一厂的基本建设资金已达到接管时该厂原有固定资产总额的百分之九十八点三二。
    经过几年来大力的恢复、改建与扩充，许多主要企业的设备能力已逐步达到平衡，并由于工人积极性的发挥，生产能力、产品质量都大大提高，成本则相对降低。一零一厂轧钢场原来动力设备不足，不能同时轧制国家迫切需要的钢轨和其他钢材，一九五一年恢复了某千匹马力蒸汽机一部，增加了动力设备能力一倍以上，使钢轨产量提高了百分之四十七，并保证国家每年可以获得成万吨的各种钢材。该厂新建平炉两座已基本安装完成，再适当增建炼铁设备，开工后即可使该厂炼铁、炼钢、轧钢的生产能力得到平衡，从而改变过去依赖外区远途供应钢胚的不合理现象。重庆机床厂原来只是一个小型的汽车修配厂，目前已经拥有立式车床、平面磁铁磨床、五三二型工具机等各种最新式苏联机器，并已着手试制工作母机。原贵州机械厂过去由几个小厂合并而成，主要做修理工作，现已改为贵阳矿山机器厂。过去专门修理电机的二零四厂将改为昆明电机厂，专门制造发电机和变压器。其余各厂亦已逐步走向独立生产，并将按齿轮机械、动力机械、农业机械、建筑用机械等产品类别，进行生产分工，向专业化方向发展。改建工作还纠正了过去反动统治时代的盲目建厂现象，如原设在贵州的六一五纱厂，所用原棉要从重庆、广西分别运去，今年六月迁到重庆与裕华纱厂合并，这样就使技术设备更加集中，生产管理更为加强。
    改建、扩建工程进一步提高了厂矿的生产设备水平，并促进生产逐步走向自动化、机械化。云南锡业公司今年基本建设中长达十六公里的架空索道工程、索道的运塃兜是自动装塃和自动倒塃的；新型选矿厂工程中有自动的扒塃机和输送皮带；火力发电厂也有自动的上煤设备和控制器。采煤工业中四零一等四个矿今年来就增添了风钻、风镐等风动工具数百部。四零一矿原来矿井排水及提煤用的是蒸汽动力，今年新建的某千基罗瓦特发电厂完工后，排水、提煤已开始使用电力，大大降低了井下温度，并为今后该矿采煤机械化提供了动力条件。
    改建、扩建工程在改善工人劳动条件和生活条件方面也起了很大的作用。四零五煤矿等四个矿在通风设备方面今年即添设了压风机若干部、抽风机若干台及一部风扇。纺织工业通风降温工程的投资占全部基本建设投资的百分之十二点八。六一零厂、六一二厂的细纱、粗纱、钢丝、清花各主要车间已全部装好屋顶喷水和排气风扇设备。六一零厂细纱、粗纱、钢丝各车间今年翻修屋面，增添了隔热设备，并将原来的水泥地全部安装了具有弹性的地板。几年来，各厂矿企业进行改建、扩建的工程面积都很大。一零一厂三年中新建厂房、仓库、职工宿舍等工程面积共达四万五千平方公尺，其中职工宿舍占百分之六十，已先后解决了近七千人的住宿问题。
