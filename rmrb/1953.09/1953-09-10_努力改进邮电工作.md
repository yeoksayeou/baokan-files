    The "Instructions on the Basic Situation of Postal and Telecommunications Work and the Work Deployment for the Second Half of 1953," issued by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications of the Central People's Government on August 27, affirmed the achievements of postal and telecommunications work over the past three years, exposed and criticized serious errors in the work, and pointed out the direction and methods for improving the work in the future. This further clarified the nature and important role of postal and telecommunications work, which is of extreme importance for transforming and improving the long-standing chaotic situation in postal and telecommunications work.

    As the instructions of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications pointed out: In the past three years, the postal and telecommunications departments have done a lot of work, but they have also made serious mistakes on several important issues. For example, violating policies and one-sidedly pursuing income, a large number of congratulatory telegrams were solicited during the 30th anniversary of the Communist Party of China, which seriously damaged the prestige of the Party. Another example is the indiscriminate deployment of the increase production and practice economy campaign, deviating from the characteristics of postal and telecommunications work, resulting in boundless engagement in secondary businesses such as running purchasing and sales agencies, and soliciting a large number of commodity parcels, while mail was severely backlogged and delayed. Furthermore, the assignment of "developing business" tasks to various business personnel, detached from politics and reality, prompted many employees to promote newspapers and journals, postal notes, solicit express calls, express telegrams, and double-registered letters by means of seeking favors, making entreaties, deception, and even compulsory quotas. In addition, the work of "unified postal distribution" and planned distribution also caused some unnecessary chaos due to eagerness for quick results. All of these seriously damaged the interests of the Party and the people, and damaged the reputation of the people's postal and telecommunications cause. Postal and telecommunications work should be the most welcomed by the people, but postal and telecommunications work that is detached from politics and the masses is bound to cause dissatisfaction among the broad masses. These experiences and lessons should arouse the deep vigilance of all postal and telecommunications workers!

    The reason for the various errors in the work of the postal and telecommunications departments lies in their serious mistake of decentralism in politics. In the past, their major measures were rarely reported to the higher authorities for instructions before they were implemented on their own initiative; the postal and telecommunications departments at all levels excessively emphasized the "vertical system," and rarely reported to the local party committees for instructions. Some postal and telecommunications departments in some places even did not respect or accept the leadership of the local party committees, resulting in weak political and ideological leadership and the phenomenon of commandism divorced from politics and reality in the work. The past mistakes in the work of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications prove that wherever there is a tendency towards decentralism, there will inevitably be weak political and ideological leadership, and deviations will inevitably occur in business.

    In the past six months or so, under the criticism and instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications accepted opinions from all sides, and combined with the struggle against bureaucracy, reviewed the guiding ideology and business deviations, strengthened political and ideological work, exposed and corrected errors and shortcomings, and on this basis, improved various business works, which has begun to achieve good results. This proves once again that as long as decentralism is overcome and ideological and political work is strengthened, business work will inevitably improve accordingly. The mistakes in the work of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and the experience of correcting mistakes should also arouse the vigilance of other departments, and pay attention to drawing lessons from them.

    The phenomenon of decentralism does not only exist in the work of the postal and telecommunications departments, it also exists in other departments and other works. For example, haven't some departments' important measures caused serious adverse consequences because they were implemented arbitrarily without requesting instructions or consulting with various regions, and subjectively stipulating a set of methods? Haven't some departments' works caused serious detachment from politics and the masses due to the bureaucratic style of leading cadres and the commandism of lower-level cadres? In order to further improve our work in all aspects, shouldn't every working department oppose decentralism, subjectivism, and bureaucracy? Isn't this very clear?

    The instructions of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications pointed out that there are still many problems in the current postal and telecommunications work that hinder the progress of the work. The main ones are: First, security education is insufficient, and the organization also has impure elements. Incidents of loss, leakage, and theft of state communication secrets occur constantly, making it impossible to fully guarantee state secrets. Second, the quality of postal and telecommunications work is poor, and errors, backlogs, and obstacles are very serious. Third, the political significance of newspaper and magazine distribution work is not sufficiently recognized, and there is still a phenomenon of blind distribution. Fourth, the basic construction plan and the business plan are not in line with reality, and the components of blindness and temporary patchwork are very large, which is far from meeting the requirements of national planning work. At the same time, the instructions also stipulated that in the second half of the year, efforts should be concentrated on earnestly improving these aspects of work. These instructions and regulations of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications are correct and timely. Only by doing these works well can we further improve postal and telecommunications work and give play to the role of postal and telecommunications work. However, to do these works well, we must distinguish between the important and the urgent, and proceed step by step. In particular, strengthening security work and improving work quality should be taken as the basic link in improving all works.

    The security work of the postal and telecommunications departments has been done very poorly for a long time. For example, in a certain city's telecommunications bureau, among 272 employees, there were 498 incidents of leakage and disclosure of secrets within a year, including 41 pieces of confidential information related to national defense and public security, and 29 pieces of economic information, which shows the seriousness of the problem. In other places, it has been discovered more than once that hidden counter-revolutionary elements used radios to communicate with the enemy or steal secrets. We all know that the postal and telecommunications departments are important communication agencies of the state, undertaking communication tasks in the military, political, economic, and cultural aspects of the country. If the current situation of security work is not changed immediately, the serious damage it will cause to the interests of the state and the people will be unimaginable. In order to strengthen the security work of the postal and telecommunications departments, on the one hand, effective measures should be taken to gradually tighten the organization of the postal and telecommunications departments step by step in a planned way. On the other hand, political and ideological leadership should be strengthened, paralysis ideas should be corrected, deep education in keeping state communication secrets should be carried out, and a strict security system should be established, so that the postal and telecommunications departments must gradually become reliable communication agencies of the state.

    Improving the quality of postal and telecommunications work is another key issue in improving postal and telecommunications work. The specific manifestation of the quality of postal and telecommunications work is to see whether it can be accurate, rapid, safe, and convenient. The current postal and telecommunications work is far from satisfactory in these aspects, and the phenomenon of backlog and errors is very serious. According to statistics from a certain city's post office in the spring of this year, an average of 500 errors occur every day. The phenomenon of often making mistakes in numbers when sending economic telegrams, poor sound quality of local and long-distance calls, and delayed delivery of newspapers and magazines also often causes political and economic losses to the state and the people. As the instructions of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications said: "The existence of these problems is mainly due to poor management, the lack of a responsibility system, and the lack of original records and management indicators; at the same time, the political and ideological education among employees is too poor, and there is a lack of a foundation of conscientious and responsible ideological awareness." In order to improve the quality of postal and telecommunications work, in addition to conducting political and business education for all employees, we should immediately launch a labor competition with improving quality as the content, further promote advanced experience, consolidate labor discipline, strengthen management work, establish a responsibility system, and on this basis, strive to complete and overfulfill the national plan.

    The distribution of postal and telecommunications organizations is very wide, the strength of postal and telecommunications workers is very weak, and the development of postal and telecommunications work in various places is also very uneven. In order to ensure the completion of the various works stipulated in the instructions of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, the postal and telecommunications departments at all levels must resolutely rely on the leadership of the local party committees and governments, closely cooperate with relevant departments, specifically arrange their own works, and resolutely oppose decentralism, subjectivism, and bureaucracy. At the same time, within the postal and telecommunications departments, ideological and political work should be strengthened, a political work system should be established, and the political and business levels of the workers should be continuously improved. Only in this way can we improve postal and telecommunications work and complete the glorious tasks assigned to the postal and telecommunications departments by the state.

### 努力改进邮电工作

    努力改进邮电工作
    中央人民政府邮电部于八月二十七日发出的“关于邮电工作基本情况和一九五三年下半年工作部署的指示”，肯定了三年来邮电工作的成绩，揭露和批判了工作中的严重错误，指出了今后改进工作的方针和办法，从而进一步明确了邮电工作的性质及其重要作用，这对于转变和改进邮电工作中长期存在的混乱状况有极其重要的意义。
    正如邮电部指示中所指出的：三年多来，邮电部门曾经作了很多工作，但在若干重要问题上也犯了严重的错误。例如违反政策、片面地追求收入，在中国共产党三十周年纪念时大批招揽庆贺电报，严重地损害了党的威信。再如离开邮电工作的特点笼统地布置增产节约运动，结果发生了漫无边际的举办代购代销业务、大量兜揽商品包裹等等非主要业务的工作，而邮件却被大量积压延误。又如脱离政治、脱离实际地分配给各种业务人员以“发展业务”的任务，促成很多职工用求亲恳友、欺骗蒙哄、直至用强迫摊派的办法推销报刊、邮简，招揽加急电话、加急电报和双挂号信件等等。此外如“邮发合一”、计划发行等项工作，也因为急于求成而引起了不应有的一些混乱。这些，都严重地损害了党和人民的利益，损害了人民邮电事业的信誉。邮电工作，应该是最受人民群众欢迎的，而脱离了政治、脱离了群众的邮电工作，就必然引起广大人民的不满。这些经验教训，应该引起全体邮电工作人员的深刻警惕！
    邮电部门工作中产生各种错误的原因，在于他们在政治上犯了严重的分散主义的错误。他们的各项重大措施，过去很少向上级请示报告即擅作主张加以推行；各级邮电部门过分强调“垂直系统”，也很少向地方党委请示报告，甚至有些地方的邮电部门，不尊重和不接受地方党委的领导，因而政治思想领导薄弱，在工作上发生了脱离政治脱离实际的强迫命令现象。邮电部过去在工作中的错误证明了凡是存在有分散主义倾向的地方，必然同时也是政治思想领导薄弱的地方，因而在业务中就必然要发生偏差。
    最近半年多以来，在党中央和毛主席的批评与指示下，邮电部接受了各方面的意见，并结合反官僚主义的斗争，检查了领导思想和业务偏向，加强了政治思想工作，揭发和改正了错误和缺点，并在此基础上，改进各项业务工作，已开始收到了好的成效。这又证明了只要克服分散主义和加强思想政治工作，业务工作也就必然会随着有所改进。邮电部工作的错误及其改正错误的经验，也应该引起其它部门的警惕，注意吸取他们的教训。
    分散主义的现象决不只是存在于邮电部门的工作中，它也存在于其它部门和其它工作中。例如有些部门的重要措施，不是也曾经因为既未请示报告又未与各地区商量，主观主义地规定一套办法即擅自推行，因而造成了严重恶果吗？有些部门的工作，不是也曾经因为领导干部的官僚主义作风，下级干部的强迫命令，因而造成了严重脱离政治脱离群众的情况吗？为了进一步改进我们各方面的工作，每个工作部门都应该反对分散主义、主观主义和官僚主义，难道这不是很明白的吗？
    邮电部的指示中指出，目前邮电工作中还存在很多问题妨碍着工作的前进。其中主要的是：一、保密教育不够，组织上也存在着不纯的情况，遗失、泄漏和盗窃国家通信机密的事件不断发生，使国家机密不能完全保证。二、邮电工作质量低劣，差错、积压和障碍很严重。三、对报刊发行工作的政治意义认识不足，仍然有盲目分配的现象。四、基本建设计划和业务计划不切合实际，盲目性和临时拼凑成分很大，远不能适应国家计划工作的要求。同时，在指示中也规定了下半年要集中力量认真改进这几方面的工作。邮电部的这些指示和规定是正确的、适时的。只有作好这些工作，才能进一步改进邮电工作，发挥邮电工作的作用。但是要作好这些工作，必须分别轻重缓急，有步骤地进行。特别应该把加强保密工作和提高工作质量，作为改进一切工作的基本环节。
    邮电部门的保密工作长时间以来都是做得很差的。例如有一个城市的电信局，二百七十二个职工中，一年内就发生了失密、泄密等事件四百九十八起，其中有关国防和治安的机密情报四十一件，经济情报二十九件，足见其问题的严重性。在其它地方，也不止一次地发现过暗藏的反革命分子利用电台和敌人通报或偷窃机密的事情。我们大家都知道，邮电部门是国家的重要通讯机关，负担着国家军事、政治、经济和文化方面的通讯任务，如不即速改变其保密工作的现状，其对国家和人民的利益所招致的损失的严重，将是不可设想的。为了加强邮电部门的保密工作，一方面应该采取有效措施，有计划有步骤地把邮电部门的组织一步一步地严密起来，另一方面应该加强政治思想领导，纠正麻痹思想，深入地进行保守国家通讯机密的教育，并建立起严格的保密制度，务必使邮电部门逐步成为国家可靠的通讯机关。
    提高邮电工作的质量，是改进邮电工作的另一个关键性的问题。邮电工作质量好坏的具体表现，就是要看它是不是能作到准确、迅速、安全和方便。目前的邮电工作在这几方面都作得很不能令人满意，积压和差错的现象十分严重。有一个城市的邮局，据今年春天的统计，平均每天要发生五百件差错。在拍发经济电报时经常把数字弄错，市内电话和长途电话音质不良，发送报刊延误时间等等现象，也常常给国家和人民造成政治上和经济上的损失。正如邮电部指示中所说的：“这些问题的存在，主要是管理不善，责任制没有建立，以及缺少原始记录和管理指标；同时在职工中的政治思想教育太差，缺乏认真负责的思想觉悟基础。”为了提高邮电工作的质量，除应向全体职工进行政治和业务教育而外，目前即应以提高质量为内容，展开劳动竞赛，进一步推广先进经验，巩固劳动纪律，加强管理工作，建立责任制度，并在此基础上争取完成和超额完成国家计划。
    邮电组织的分布很广，邮电工作人员的力量很薄弱，而各地邮电工作的发展也很不平衡；为了保证完成邮电部指示中所规定的各项工作，各级邮电部门今后必须坚决依靠各地党委和政府的领导，与有关部门密切合作，具体地安排自己的工作，坚决反对分散主义、主观主义和官僚主义。同时，在邮电部门内，应加强思想政治工作，建立政治工作制度，不断提高工作人员的政治和业务水平。只有这样，才能改进邮电工作，完成国家交给邮电部门的光荣任务。
