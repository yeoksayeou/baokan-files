Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 10th - Nine unrepatriated Korean People's Army prisoners of war broke through the control of the US-Syngman Rhee special agents while under the custody of Indian troops and resolutely demanded repatriation. They have been placed under separate guard by the Indian troops, and the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission decided at its meeting on the afternoon of the 10th to repatriate them to the Korean-Chinese side on the 11th.

Starting today, Korean and Chinese prisoners of war detained by the US side but not directly repatriated are being handed over to the custody of Indian troops in the southern part of the demilitarized zone. Today, one thousand Korean People's Army prisoners of war were handed over to the Indian troops. The US-Syngman Rhee special agents, hidden in the POW camps, tightly controlled our captured personnel, but nine prisoners of war still broke through their control and demanded to return to their homeland. Some ran out of the POW ranks during the handover, some reiterated their will during the handover registration, and one had already entered the detention camp under the control of the special agents, but he still rushed out of the barbed wire fence, at which point the US-Syngman Rhee special agents among the prisoners of war openly pushed him to the ground and beat him severely. After rushing out, they threw the Syngman Rhee gang's Taegeukgi (flag) that the special agents had forced them to carry on the ground, and one of them happened to meet a translator accompanying the Korean-Chinese observer representatives, and he excitedly stood at attention and saluted.

During the process of transporting these prisoners of war to the demilitarized zone, the special agents in the POW camps forced them to carry the Syngman Rhee gang's Taegeukgi and slogans insulting Korea and China, and wore hats with the words "Anti-Communist Unification." The special agents also shouted reactionary slogans wildly. When repatriating the directly repatriated prisoners of war, the US side repeatedly attacked our prisoners of war with bayonets and tear gas because they were carrying their own national flags and singing their national songs. Now, the US side is fully supporting and protecting the special agents' violent behavior, which clearly shows that the US side is using all means to attempt to detain our prisoners of war.

    九个未直接遣返的我方被俘人员突破特务控制坚决要求遣返
    中立国遣返委员会决定即将他们遣返给我方
    【新华社开城十日电】九个未直接遣返的朝鲜人民军被俘人员在交由印度部队看管的过程中突破美李特务的控制，坚决要求遣返。他们已由印度部队单独看管，中立国遣返委员会并在十日下午的会议上决定十一日即将他们遣返给朝中方面。
    在美方拘留下未直接遣返的朝中被俘人员，于今天开始在非军事区南部交由印度部队看管。今天交给印度部队看管的是朝鲜人民军被俘人员一千人。暗藏在战俘营中的美李特务严密地控制着我方被俘人员，但是仍有九个被俘人员突破特务的控制，要求返回祖国。其中有的是在交接时跑出战俘的队伍，有的是在交接登记时再次表示了自己的意志，还有一个在特务的控制下已经进入拘留营场，但是他仍然冲出铁丝网，这时战俘中的美李特务竟公然把他按倒在地上痛打。他们在冲出后就把特务强迫他们拿的李匪帮的太极旗丢在地上，其中一个恰好遇到随朝中观察代表的翻译人员，他兴奋地立正致敬礼。
    在这些被俘人员被运送到非军事区的过程中，战俘营里的特务们强迫他们拿着李匪帮的太极旗和侮蔑朝中的标语，在帽子上缀着“反共统一”的字样，特务们并狂呼反动口号。在遣送直接遣返的被俘人员时，美方曾多次因我方被俘人员拿着自己祖国的国旗和唱祖国的歌曲，而用刺刀和毒气弹向他们攻击，现在美方对特务们的那些狂暴行为却全力加以支持和庇护，这清楚地说明了美方采用一切办法企图扣留我方被俘人员的阴谋。
