    Handan Cotton and Cloth Company
    Strengthens Raw Cotton Storage Work
    The state-owned Handan Cotton and Cloth Company in Handan Prefecture, Hebei Province, is actively strengthening raw cotton storage work, learning from the lessons of the Dong Cotton Depot fire incident. The Handan District Company of the China Cotton and Cloth Company, due to insufficient attention to raw cotton storage work in the past, experienced a fire at the Dong Cotton Depot on June 5th this year, resulting in significant losses to state property. Learning from this lesson, the company began construction in early July on two new warehouses capable of storing large quantities of raw cotton. This project was completed by the end of August, and raw cotton storage began on September 5th. To prevent accidents both organizationally and systematically, and to ensure timely rescue in the event of an accident, the company organized a Security Committee, strengthened security and fire control organizations, and formulated necessary warehouse management systems, such as a warehouse director responsibility system, inbound and outbound inspection and registration systems, and separate storage of cloth and raw cotton.
    After the fire at the Dong Cotton Depot of the Handan Cotton and Cloth Company, some cadres developed the idea of not wanting and not daring to do raw cotton storage and preservation work. To clarify these confused ideas, Hao Tianyi, Secretary of the Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, summoned all the company's staff to make a report. The local committees of the Chinese Communist Party and the Commissioner's Office also sent responsible cadres to help the company educate employees on cherishing state property, thereby enhancing the understanding of the staff and ensuring the smooth progress of warehouse construction and cotton receiving work. In addition, to strengthen this work, the local committees of the Chinese Communist Party and the Commissioner's Office promptly transferred six section-chief-level cadres to serve as raw cotton warehouse directors and raw cotton storage and transportation section chiefs, and will continue to transfer warehouse staff.

    邯郸花纱布公司
    加强原棉保管工作
    河北省邯郸专区国营花纱布公司，接受东棉库失火事件的教训，积极加强原棉保管工作。中国花纱布公司邯郸区公司，过去由于对原棉保管工作重视不够，今年六月五日，曾发生东棉库失火事件，使国家资财遭受了巨大损失。接受这一教训，该公司从七月初开始，即动工新建二座可以容纳大量原棉的仓库。这一工程已于八月底竣工，并已从九月五日起开始收储原棉。为要从组织上、制度上来防止事故的发生，及发生事故后可得到及时的抢救，该公司组织了保安委员会，加强了警卫和消防的组织；制订了必要的仓库管理制度，如仓库主任负责制，出、入库检查、登记制等，以及纱布与原棉分库保管等办法。
    邯郸花纱布公司东棉库失火事件发生后，部分干部曾产生了不愿和不敢做原棉储保工作的思想。为了澄清这些混乱思想，中共市委书记郝田役召集了该公司全体工作人员作了报告。中共地方委员会、专员公署还派了负责干部帮助该公司向职工进行了爱护国家资财的教育，因而提高了工作人员的认识，保证了建仓工作和接收棉花工作的顺利进行。此外，为了加强这一工作，中共地方委员会和专员公署还及时地调配了六个科长级的干部充任该公司原棉仓库主任和原棉储运科长等职务，并将继续调配仓库工作人员。　（韩角今）
