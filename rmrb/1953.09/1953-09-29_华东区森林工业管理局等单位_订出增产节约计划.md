    Set Production Increase and Thrift Plan

    The East China Forest Industry Bureau convened a meeting of the heads of forest industry bureaus from various provinces in early September and formulated a plan for the entire region's forest industry to increase production and conserve over 590 billion yuan within the year. In terms of increased production, forest areas in Fujian, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces will produce an additional 400,000 cubic meters of timber this winter, valued at approximately 560 billion yuan.

    Seven forest industry bureaus in the Mudanjiang Forest Area of Songjiang Province have jointly formulated a plan to increase timber production by 109,600 cubic meters, which will increase the national output by 76.7 billion yuan annually.
