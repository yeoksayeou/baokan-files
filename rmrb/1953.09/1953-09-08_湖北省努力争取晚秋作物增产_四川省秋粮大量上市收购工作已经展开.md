Central South News Agency Report:

    Hubei Province is working hard to increase late autumn crop production.
    Sichuan Province's autumn grain is marketed in large quantities and procurement work has begun.
    [Our Central South Reporter Station] Farmers in various parts of Hubei Province are actively planting late autumn crops and preparing for wheat planting.
    Farmers in Hubei Province overcame natural disasters this year, and one-third of the province achieved a bumper harvest. Now, all parts of the province are taking advantage of the favorable conditions in the Yangtze River region of Hubei, where the climate is warm and suitable for late autumn crops, and where some farmers have a tradition of planting late autumn crops. They are vigorously leading farmers to plant late autumn crops. In most areas of Huanggang, Xiaogan, Jingzhou, and Yichang regions, the area planted with late autumn crops has generally increased by more than 10% compared to last year, and in some areas, it has increased by as much as 40%.
    In order to strive for a bumper harvest in late autumn, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Hubei Provincial People's Government called on all localities to vigorously accumulate fertilizer. Without reducing the area sown with grain, they should make full use of idle land to plant green manure crops such as purple alfalfa (red clover) and vetch (orchid clover). In wheat-growing areas, women should be mobilized to use their spare time to cut more green grass, pull aquatic plants and lake duckweed, and collect bean stalks and by-products to make compost. Farmers in Wuchang, Xishui, and Xiaogan and other places are now actively accumulating fertilizer.
    Various localities are also actively preparing for wheat planting. Farmers in Shanhe Township, Yidu County, are rushing to carry out autumn plowing after the autumn harvest. In the township's 1,439 mu of paddy fields, 97 cattle are plowing the fields every day. The Xiaogan County Committee of the Communist Party of China called on every farmer in the county to accumulate ten more dan of manure, plow one more time, and harrow one more time this year than last year, and to plow deeper by three to five fen; at the same time, it instructed the Department of Agriculture and Forestry to prepare 100,000 jin of the high-quality wheat variety "Nanda 2419" and mobilize farmers to exchange for high-quality wheat seeds; it instructed cooperative and trade departments to actively complete the supply of 10 million jin of commercial fertilizer to meet the needs of farmers for wheat planting.
    At present, a few cadres in some areas do not pay enough attention to the planting of late autumn crops and the preparation for wheat planting, and they lack confidence in leading the masses to plant late autumn crops. According to past habits, the general public does not pay much attention to late autumn crops either, letting them grow naturally, harvesting as much as they can, and unwilling to weed, fertilize, cultivate, or nurture them. To this end, the Party and government leading organs of Hubei Province have made "vigorously striving to increase the production and harvest of late autumn crops and actively preparing for wheat planting" the overriding central task in the current rural work, calling on rural work cadres throughout the province to overcome complacency and conservatism, lead the masses to continue to fight against various natural disasters, vigorously promote the planting of late autumn crops, carry out the preparation for wheat planting, and, while carrying out autumn plowing and autumn sowing, pay attention to organizing various forms of temporary labor exchange and mutual assistance to consolidate and improve year-round mutual aid teams to solve the various difficulties of the masses in autumn plowing and autumn sowing.

    [Our Southwest Reporter Station] Sichuan Province has generally achieved increased autumn grain production this year. New grain has begun to pour into the market, and state-owned grain companies and supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of the province are vigorously carrying out autumn grain procurement work. More than 1,100 procurement stations scattered throughout the province have been equipped with cadres, and warehouses and scales for grain purchase have also been fully prepared. In order to strengthen the unified leadership of grain purchase work and conscientiously implement price policies, the Sichuan Provincial Grain Department of the People's Government and the Preparatory Committee of the Sichuan Provincial Cooperative Federation jointly signed an autumn grain agency purchase agreement at the end of August. The agreement not only stipulates the types of grain and the quality of various grains, but also stipulates that the "cash on delivery" method must be adopted in accordance with the posted price, and the policy of grading and pricing must be implemented to prevent disguised price increases or price reductions in terms of quality. The Grain Company, Cooperative, and People's Bank of Meishan County and other departments have formed a "Joint Office for Autumn Grain Procurement" to unifiedly lead the grain purchase work. The County People's Bank adopted a telephone remittance method, simplifying the procedures and greatly facilitating the progress of the procurement work. In the procurement process, various localities generally strive to be diligent in collecting, collecting in small amounts, collecting every day, and collecting as soon as they arrive, in order to facilitate farmers' grain sales. Some places have also organized mobile procurement teams to go deep into the countryside to collect grain on a rotational basis. At the same time, various localities pay attention to conducting patriotic education for farmers, so grain sellers are very enthusiastic. In Luzhou, Jiangjin, Neijiang, Leshan, Nanchong, Suining, Fuling and other regions, the daily purchase volume is more than 500,000 jin. As of August 22, the province had purchased 30 million jin of new grain.

### 湖北省努力争取晚秋作物增产  四川省秋粮大量上市收购工作已经展开

    湖北省努力争取晚秋作物增产
    四川省秋粮大量上市收购工作已经展开
    【本报中南记者站讯】湖北省各地农民积极种植晚秋作物，并进行种麦的准备工作。
    湖北省农民今年战胜了自然灾害，全省三分之一的地区获得了丰收。现在全省各地正利用湖北沿江地区气候温暖、适宜于晚秋作物生长和一部分农民群众有种植晚秋作物习惯等有利条件，大力领导农民种植晚秋作物。黄冈、孝感、荆州、宜昌专区的大部地区种植晚秋作物的面积，一般比去年增加百分之十以上，个别地区增加达百分之四十。
    为了争取晚秋丰收，湖北省人民政府农林厅号召各地大力积肥。在不减少粮食播种面积下，尽量利用休闲地种植紫云英（红花草）、苕子（兰花草）等绿肥。在种小麦地区，发动妇女利用闲暇时间多割青草，扯水草、湖萍，收集豆禾及副产物等制作堆肥。现在武昌、浠水、孝感等地农民都在积极进行积肥。
    各地也在积极进行种麦准备工作。宜都县山河乡农民在秋收后，突击进行秋耕。全乡一千四百三十九亩水田，每天都有九十七条牛耕田。中共孝感县委会，号召全县每个农民，今年要比去年多积十担粪，多耕一遍，多耙一遍，并深耕三分到五分；同时责成农林科准备优良麦种“南大二四一九”十万斤，发动农民调换优良麦种；责成合作、贸易部门积极完成一千万斤商品肥料，供应农民种麦需要。
    目前某些地区的少数干部对种植晚秋作物和准备种麦工作还不够重视，对领导群众种晚秋作物没有信心。一般群众根据过去习惯，也不很重视晚秋作物，任其自生自长，收多少算多少，不愿?草追肥，加工培植。为此，湖北省党、政领导机关已将“大力争取晚秋作物增产丰收，积极做好种麦准备工作”作为目前农村工作中压倒一切的中心任务，号召全省农村工作干部，克服麻痹与保守思想，领导群众继续与各种自然灾害作斗争，大力推广种植晚秋作物，进行种小麦的准备工作，并在进行秋耕秋种的同时，注意组织各种形式的临时换工互助，巩固与提高常年互助组，以解决群众在秋耕、秋种中的各种困难。
    【本报西南记者站讯】四川省秋粮今年普遍获得增产，新粮开始涌入市场，全省各地国营粮食公司和供销合作社正大力展开秋粮收购工作。散布在全省的一千一百多个收购站已配备好干部，购粮所用仓库、磅秤，也都预备齐全。为加强购粮工作的统一领导，并认真贯彻价格政策，四川省人民政府粮食厅与四川省合作社联合社筹备委员会于八月底共同签订了秋粮代购协议书。协议书不仅规定了购粮的种类与各种粮食的品质，而且规定必须按照牌价采取“现款现货”方式，贯彻分等论价政策，防止品质上发生变相提价、压价等现象。眉山县粮食公司、合作社和人民银行等部门已组成“秋粮收购联合办公室”，统一领导购粮工作。县人民银行采用电话汇款方式，简化了手续，大大便利了收购工作的进行。在收购中，各地为便利农民售粮，一般都作到了勤收、零收、天天收、随到随收，有些地方并组织流动收购组，深入农村轮回收购。同时，各地并注意对农民进行爱国主义教育，因此售粮者非常踊跃。泸州、江津、内江、乐山、南充、遂宁、涪陵等专区，每天的收购量都在五十万斤以上。到八月二十二日止，全省已收新谷三千万斤。
