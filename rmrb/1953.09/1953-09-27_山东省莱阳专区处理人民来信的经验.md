    The regular, close, and earnest attention to handling people's letters is a bridge connecting the Party and the People's Government with the masses, and it is also an important method for opposing bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline. Under the guidance of the Shandong Sub-bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Shandong Provincial People's Government, various agencies in the Laiyang Special District of Shandong Province have gradually attached importance to and strengthened the work of handling people's letters, and have gradually explored some important methods and experiences in handling people's letters. As a result, cadres at all levels have been profoundly educated, the struggle against bureaucracy, coercion and commandism, and violations of law and discipline has been effectively promoted, the enthusiasm of the masses in supervising the government and cadres has been greatly brought into play, and the masses' sense of ownership and enthusiasm for production in participating in the management of state affairs have also been enhanced.

    In the first half of this year, agencies in Laiyang Special District received a total of 6,473 letters from the people (including those left over from last year), and 2,885 have been processed and closed (accounting for more than 44 percent), of which 151 relatively major ones have been handled with great fanfare. There are four methods used by agencies in this special district to handle people's letters: First, handling specific cases. In the first half of this year, each county seized one or two typical cases of heinous crimes and great public resentment, which were personally grasped by the county party committee, organizing forces to understand the situation in depth, implementing policies, and mobilizing the masses to handle them. As a result, the goals of consolidating organizations and developing production were achieved. Second, discussing and handling them through county and township people's representative conferences in conjunction with central tasks. At the county level, the focus is on discussing and dealing with policy-related issues and typical cases of great educational significance. General cases are handled at the township people's representative conferences, but they must be combined with conferences implementing work, that is, the issues raised in the people's letters are incorporated into proposals and discussed and handled together. In May, the counties in the special district successfully handled 667 people's letters at the township people's representative conferences implementing central work. This also shows that if the township people's representative conferences are held well, they can not only correctly handle the problems reflected by the people and promote various tasks, but also improve the masses' awareness, improve the ability of district and township cadres to distinguish and handle problems, establish their prestige among the masses, make the masses feel that "there is truth in districts and townships," feel that "township people's representative conferences can handle big things," and gradually turn the letters that the masses want to write to higher-level agencies into proposals in the townships. Third, handling people's letters through various tasks and through various business units. The key here is that each department must have a high sense of responsibility and a spirit of "drawing inferences from one instance," listen to the voices of the masses, and transform work styles and improve operations by handling people's letters. When the cooperative in the special district received a letter from the masses requesting help in installing old waterwheels, the leading cadres, in the spirit of "drawing inferences from one instance," conducted a general inspection of the work of lending waterwheels. Then, they organized a large number of cadres to go to the countryside to solve the problem of waterwheel installation, and at the same time solved the problems of adding parts, improving water cylinders, technical guidance on fertilizer use, and the supply of small farm tools. Therefore, the masses are very satisfied with the work of the cooperative, and the cooperative's business itself has been greatly improved. Fourth, continue to consolidate and further develop the system of receiving visits from the people. In today's situation where the cultural level of most farmers is not high, the policy level of many cadres is relatively low, and the work style is still being transformed, the establishment of this system is very important. According to the practice in this special district for the past six months, the masses have responded very well. Of course, it is not enough for the county magistrate to receive people's visits regularly. It is necessary to educate all organizations and cadres to maintain close ties with the masses, listen to the voices and demands of the masses at all times, and solve problems for the masses as much as possible anytime and anywhere.

    From the practice of various units in Laiyang Special District in handling people's letters in the past six months, the key issue is that party committees at all levels must have the determination to overcome bureaucracy. This is not only because handling people's letters requires a high degree of mass perspective that cares about the suffering of the masses, but also because almost every people's letter is related to leaders at all levels. Therefore, the determination to correct bureaucracy has become the key to whether people's letters can be handled well. Conversely, doing a good job in handling people's letters will promote the struggle against bureaucracy. After handling typical events, the county party committees of Laixi, Laiyang, Huangxian, Yexian, Pingxi, Pingdu, and Qixia counties raised their awareness and made up their minds. As a result, they not only did a better job in handling people's letters and visits, but also further discovered the serious phenomena of bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, and the problems existing in various tasks, thus effectively promoting the transformation of work style and the smooth progress of work. Secondly, it must be combined with the central task and promote the central task. At the beginning, many cadres were afraid that handling people's letters would affect production and business work and regarded it as an "extra burden." However, the bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline that exist in some of our cadres are the real obstacles to production development. And handling people's letters is an effective medicine to cure these diseases. Experience has proved that as long as we can grasp the internal connection between handling people's letters and production, we will be able to find the forms and experience of combining the two. In the investigation work of handling people's letters, as long as we can start from production and grasp the key problems that hinder the development of production, the situation will be easy to clarify; when handling the problem, if we can educate the parties concerned around the purpose of being conducive to production, there will be less resistance; after the handling, if we guide the enthusiasm of the masses to production, we will naturally achieve multiple effects with one action. It not only satisfies the demands of the masses, but also strengthens the ties with the masses, and directly promotes production. Third, it is necessary to conduct a case triage, first of all, carefully analyze the nature of all cases, distinguish between bureaucracy, coercion, and violations of law and discipline, and strictly distinguish between those who beat and scold the masses and violate policies in the implementation of work and those who engage in extortion, frame the masses, and commit all kinds of evil deeds with personal purposes; separate the problems of bad elements from internal events of the people. After that, they are dealt with separately according to the severity and urgency of the case. In this way, handling the work of people's letters accurately and realistically in accordance with the party's policies will effectively combat evil and promote righteousness, and will not have the side effect of harming the work enthusiasm of the vast number of cadres and party members.

    Although the work of handling people's letters in various units in Laiyang Special District has achieved considerable success and gained some experience, there are still many problems: First, the development of various units is uneven, and some units are still doing a poor job; second, not enough attention is paid to educating and helping district and township cadres to listen to the opinions of the masses, care about the lives of the masses, and solve the general problems of the masses. This not only fails to improve the prestige of grassroots organizations and strengthen the daily ties between grassroots organizations and the broad masses, but also easily creates the phenomenon of backlog of general letters; third, some cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of the long-term nature of handling people's letters and have the idea of "blitzing through and making a clean break"; fourth, a few cadres are still not objective, calm, and tend to listen to one side in the style of handling people's letters, so that there are still unclear boundaries and the phenomenon of excessive or broad handling.

    In order to correct these shortcomings, the Laiyang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China has convened a meeting of the secretaries of the Party Discipline Inspection Committees of its subordinate counties, the procurator-general of the Prefectural People's Procuratorate, and the responsible cadres of the directly affiliated organs of the Prefectural Committee to summarize the experience of handling people's letters and lay the foundation for balanced development. Most county committees have also discussed the problems in the work of handling people's letters and are now earnestly implementing the spirit of this meeting. In the future, all counties will especially emphasize that they must listen to the opinions of the masses and solve the problems of the masses at any time and any place through county and township people's representative conferences, through district and township organizations, and through the daily activities of all cadres.

    山东省莱阳专区处理人民来信的经验
    陈垲
    经常地密切地重视处理人民来信的工作，是党与人民政府联系群众的一个桥梁，也是反对官僚主义、反对命令主义和反对违法乱纪的重要方法。山东省莱阳专区各机关，在中共中央山东分局和山东省人民政府的指示下，逐步重视和加强了处理人民来信的工作，并逐步摸索出一些处理人民来信的重要方法和经验。因而，深刻地教育了各级干部，有效地推动了反对官僚主义、反对强迫命令和反对违法乱纪的斗争，大大地发挥了群众监督政府、监督干部的积极性，也提高了群众参与管理国家事务的主人翁感和生产积极性。
    今年上半年莱阳专区各机关共收到人民来信六千四百七十三件（包括去年遗留的），已处理结束二千八百八十五件（占百分之四十四多），其中大张旗鼓地处理了一百五十一件比较重大的。该专区各机关处理人民来信的方法有四种：第一，专案处理。今年上半年，各县都抓住了一两起罪恶累累民愤很大的典型案件，由县委亲自掌握，组织力量，深入了解情况后，贯彻政策，发动群众进行处理。结果达到了整顿组织、发展生产的目的。第二，通过县、乡人民代表会议，结合中心工作进行讨论处理。在县一级，主要是讨论处理关乎政策性的问题和有重大教育意义的典型案件。一般的案件放在乡级人民代表会议上处理，但必须和贯彻工作的会议结合，即把人民来信提出的问题并入提案，一起讨论处理。该专区各县在五月份贯彻中心工作的乡人民代表会议上，便成功地处理了六百六十七件人民来信。这也说明了乡人民代表会议开得好，不仅能正确地处理人民反映的问题，推动各项工作，并且能提高群众觉悟，提高区、乡干部辨别和处理问题的能力，树立他们在群众中的威信，使群众感到“区、乡也有真理”，感到“乡人民代表会议能办大事”，使群众逐渐把所要写给上级机关的信在乡里变作提案。第三，通过各种工作，通过各业务单位处理人民来信。这里的关键是：各部门要有高度责任心和“举一反三”的精神，倾听群众呼声，通过处理人民来信，转变作风，改进业务。该专区合作社，当接到群众要求帮助安装旧有水车的来信后，领导干部便以“举一反三”的精神，把贷放水车的工作作了普遍检查。接着，他们即组织大批干部下乡，解决了水车安装问题，同时还解决了添置零件、改进水筒和肥料使用的技术指导、小农具的供应等问题。因此，群众对合作社工作很满意，合作社的业务本身也得到了很大改进。第四，继续巩固和进一步发展接待人民来访的制度。在今天多数农民文化水平还不高，许多干部的政策水平比较低，工作作风还正在转变的情况下，建立这种制度是很重要的。该专区经半年来的实践，群众反映很好。当然，如果只是县长定期接待人民来访是很不够的，必须教育所有组织和干部，都要密切和群众联系，时刻倾听群众的呼声和要求，尽可能地随时随地为群众解决问题。
    从莱阳专区各单位半年来处理人民来信的实践看来，关键问题是各级党委要有克服官僚主义的决心。这不仅因为处理人民来信要有关心群众疾苦的高度群众观念，而且因为每一件人民来信几乎都和各级领导有关。因此，决心纠正官僚主义就成了能否处理好人民来信的关键。反过来，做好处理人民来信工作，也就推动了反官僚主义斗争。莱西、莱阳、黄县、掖南、平西、平度、栖霞等县县委在处理典型事件后，提高了觉悟，下了决心，结果不仅处理人民来信、来访工作做的较好，并进一步发现了官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪的严重现象和各种工作中所存在的问题，因而有力地推动了工作作风的转变和工作的顺利进行。其次，必须与中心工作相结合，并且推动中心工作。开始时，有很多干部怕处理人民来信影响生产和业务工作，而把它看成“额外负担”。殊不知存在于我们某些干部中的官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪行为，才是真正障碍生产发展的东西。而处理人民来信正是医治这些疾病的特效药。经验证明：只要我们能抓住处理人民来信和生产的内在联系，便会摸到两者结合的形式和经验。在处理人民来信的调查工作中，只要我们能从生产入手，抓住障碍生产发展的关键性问题，情况便容易弄清；处理时，能环绕有利于生产的目的对当事人进行教育，阻力就少；处理后若把群众的积极性引向生产，自然便会收一举数得之效。既满足了群众要求，又密切了和群众的联系，还直接推动了生产。第三，要进行案件排队，首先要认真分析所有案件的性质，区别官僚主义、强迫命令和违法乱纪，把在执行工作中打骂群众违反政策的严重强迫命令分子和怀有个人目的而进行敲诈勒索、陷害群众、无恶不作的违法乱纪分子严加区分；把坏分子问题和人民内部的事件分开。之后，再根据案件的轻重缓急，分别处理。这样依据党的政策，准确地、实事求是地进行处理人民来信的工作，便有力地打击了邪气，伸张了正气，不会发生伤害广大干部、党员的工作积极性的副作用。
    莱阳专区各单位处理人民来信的工作，虽然已经获得相当大的成绩并取得了一些经验，但还存在着许多问题：第一，各单位发展不平衡，还有的单位作得不好；第二，对教育、帮助区乡干部倾听群众意见、关心群众生活、解决群众的一般性问题重视不够，这样既不能提高基层组织的威信，密切基层组织和广大群众的日常联系，又容易造成积压一般性信件的现象；第三，有些干部对处理人民来信的长期性认识不足，存有“突击一下，一了百断”的思想；第四，少数干部在处理人民来信的作风上还有不够客观、不够冷静和偏听偏信的现象，以致仍有界限不清、处理偏重偏广的现象。
    为了纠正这些缺点，中共莱阳地委已经召集所属各县党的纪律检查委员会书记、专署人民检察处检察长和地委直属机关负责干部开会，总结了处理人民来信的经验，奠定了向平衡发展的基础。多数县委会也都对处理人民来信工作中的问题作了讨论，现在正认真贯彻此次会议精神。今后，各县都特别强调要通过县、乡人民代表会议，通过区乡组织，通过所有干部的日常活动，随时随地倾听群众意见，解决群众的问题。
