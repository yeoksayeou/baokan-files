Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 21st: According to the German News Agency, the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany held its 16th plenary session on September 17th. The discussions at the meeting focused on the current stage of the struggle for a peaceful solution to the German question and the methods for conducting this struggle. Experiences were exchanged on how to implement the new policy and how to give play to the creativity of the working class, laboring farmers, and all working people. The meeting will also determine the political guidelines for preparing the Party Congress.

The First Secretary of the Central Committee, Walter Ulbricht, presented recommendations for easing domestic and international tensions in a comprehensive speech. He said: Although the situation in Germany has been deteriorating since the West German elections on September 6th, "the method of reunifying Germany is simple and clear. We propose that representatives from East and West Germany hold an all-German conference to discuss practical solutions to the reunification of Germany on a democratic and peaceful basis, and to accelerate the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. We believe that it is absolutely necessary to immediately establish an all-German provisional government to create the conditions necessary for holding and guaranteeing free all-German elections. This election must be free from all foreign interference and the pressure of large monopoly capital. The provisional government must participate in drafting a just peace treaty with the aim of meeting the basic national demands of the German people, that is, to reunify Germany under conditions of peace, independence, and freedom.

Ulbricht said that the main obstacle to concluding a peace treaty is the policy pursued by the Bonn government, which has ruined West Germany's independence with the so-called European Defense Treaty and has continued to place West Germany in the shameful position of a U.S. protectorate.

Ulbricht continued: "Adenauer is using the same tactics that Hitler used in preparing to launch World War II. He talks big about his policy of 'military strength,' claiming that he can conquer Polish territory without causing Germany any harm. The West German warmongers have clearly underestimated the strength of the world peace camp and the friendship between the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of Poland, the German Democratic Republic, and the Czechoslovak Republic. If the West German militarists pursue the aggressive aims that Adenauer has declared, they will be wiped out in the bases from which they launch their aggressive adventures." "The West German rulers are now able to act under the cover of parliament, but the balance of political forces in West Germany will shift in favor of peaceful forces, even though the West German rulers hold a majority in the Bonn parliament."

Ulbricht said: Establishing the unity of the German working class is the most important task. He exposed the fact that the right-wing Social Democratic leaders support the Adenauer government and that the Social Democratic Party is completely colluding with bourgeois parties. He said that the West German working class can only accomplish their cause if they move forward in lockstep.

Finally, Ulbricht explained the basic principles for establishing a unified and democratic Germany. Among the key points he raised as necessary for maintaining peace were: the removal of U.S. military bases in West Germany, the return of seized land to farmers, and the free return of mines, steel factories, and large chemical plants still in the hands of warmongers.

### 德国统一社会党中央举行全会  全面讨论现阶段争取和平统一德国的问题

    德国统一社会党中央举行全会
    全面讨论现阶段争取和平统一德国的问题
    【新华社二十一日讯】据德意志通讯社柏林十九日讯：德国统一社会党中央委员会于九月十七日举行第十六次全体会议。会上的讨论集中在争取和平解决德国问题的斗争的现阶段情况以及进行这一斗争的方法上。会上就如何执行新方针，如何发挥工人阶级、劳动农民以及所有劳动人民的创造力问题交流了经验。会议同时还将确定筹备党代表大会的政治方针。
    中央委员会第一书记瓦尔特·乌布利希在一篇全面的演说中提出了缓和国内与国际紧张局势的建议。他说：尽管自九月六日西德选举以来，德国的局势在日渐恶化，“使德国重归统一的方法是简单明了的。我们建议东德与西德代表举行全德会议，讨论在民主、和平的基础上，实际解决有关德国重归统一的办法，以及加速缔结对德和约的办法。我们认为，立刻成立全德临时政府，以创造举行并保障全德自由选举所必需的条件是绝对必要的。这一选举必须不受一切外国的干涉，不受大垄断资本的压力。临时政府必须参加草拟一个公正的对德和约，和约的目的在满足德国人民的基本民族要求，也就是根据和平、独立与自由的条件，使德国重归统一。
    乌布利希说，缔结和约的主要障碍是波恩政府所奉行的政策，这个政策用所谓的欧洲防务条约断送了西德的独立，并且使西德继续处于美国的保护国的可耻地位。
    乌布利希继续说：“阿登纳使用的是希特勒在准备发动第二次世界大战时所使用的同一策略。他大谈其‘军事实力’政策，硬说他能够征服波兰领土而不致使德国遭殃。西德的战争贩子显然低估了世界和平阵营的力量以及苏联、波兰人民共和国、德意志民主共和国与捷克斯洛伐克共和国之间的友谊。假如西德军国主义者追逐阿登纳所宣称的侵略目的的话，他们将被消灭在他们发动侵略冒险的根据地上。”“西德统治者现在有可能在议会的掩护下行事，但是西德政治力量的对比将发生有利于和平力量的转变，尽管西德统治者在波恩议会中占多数。”
    乌布利希说：建立德国工人阶级的统一是最重要的任务。他揭发了右翼社会民主党领袖支持阿登纳政府，以及社会民主党完全与资产阶级政党同流合污的事实。他说，西德工人阶级只有步伐一致，才能完成他们所进行的事业。
    最后，乌布利希说明了建立统一的民主的德国的基本原则。在他所举出的维持和平所必需的几个要点中有：取消美国在西德的军事基地，把霸占的土地归还农民，无偿地归还仍在战争贩子手中的矿山、钢铁工厂与大的化学工厂。
