    Vigilance – Our Weapon
    In recent months, many newspapers have exposed cases of imperialism using Catholicism for sabotage activities. Through the exposure of these cases, the newspapers have encouraged the broad masses of people to further carry out the anti-imperialist patriotic struggle, and have educated people on raising vigilance.
    The Shanghai Liberation Daily is a prominent example. In coordination with the development of Shanghai's struggle to eliminate imperialist elements and other counter-revolutionaries within the Catholic Church, the Liberation Daily successively exposed two spy cases from June to September involving imperialist elements disguised in religious garb, namely Tian Wanglin (Belgian) and Zhai Guanghua (American), exposed the crimes of imperialist elements such as Maldun (French) at the Xujiahui Sacred Heart Nursery in mass killing of Chinese infants and harboring and shielding counter-revolutionary elements, exposed the case of the counter-revolutionary organization "Shandong Provincial People's Salvation Corps" led by reactionary elements within the Catholic Church in collusion with imperialist spies and the Kuomintang military intelligence bureau, exposed the case of imperialist elements such as Luo Zhangda (French) using the Catholic "Little Brothers of Mary" to carry out conspiratorial sabotage activities, and so on. While exposing these cases, the newspaper also published many pictures and accusation articles exposing the bloody crimes of imperialist elements, and gave vivid and detailed reports on the "Exhibition of Evidence of Imperialist Conspiracy and Sabotage Activities Using Catholicism" held in Shanghai. The exposure of these cases has once again profoundly educated people: Although imperialism has suffered successive defeats, they will inevitably continue to use all means to carry out disruption and sabotage against our country. The newspaper's exposure of the vicious conspiracies and criminal activities of imperialist elements has not only aroused public outrage from all walks of life and patriotic Catholics, but has also greatly promoted people's political vigilance. Xu Shengyun of Shanghai Hengtong Yarn Factory, a Catholic with nine generations of religious belief in his family, wrote in a letter to the Liberation Daily: "I saw in the newspaper the news that the People's Government Public Security Bureau had cracked the case of imperialist elements Tian Wanglin and Lin Ren, etc., using Catholicism as a cover for espionage activities in the Taishan Apartment, and also saw the exhibition of evidence of crimes, which made me truly realize the ugly face of imperialist elements pretending to be merciful. They were hidden in the Catholic Church, using the name of religion to engage in espionage, collect intelligence, and plot to sabotage the new China. Like all patriotic and devout Catholic believers in the city, I feel infinite anger towards these imperialist elements. … Now we should all wake up, strengthen the unity of believers, and together with all the people of Shanghai, resolutely carry out a merciless struggle against the imperialist elements lurking in the Catholic Church"; in the letter, he also exposed and rebuked some imperialist elements for spreading rumors and sabotaging activities after the People's Government cracked the espionage cases.
    In addition to the Liberation Daily, the Shandong Dazhong Daily, Fujian Daily, Zhejiang Daily, Hebei Daily, Tianjin Daily and other newspapers have also exposed local espionage cases under the guise of religion. For example, the Hebei Daily published on August 17 the case of counter-revolutionary secret sabotage activities headed by Zhang Siqian and Jia Shushan in Xian County and other places. This is the second time that a counter-revolutionary secret sabotage activity case has occurred in the same area after the international espionage case within the Catholic Church in Xian County, which was cracked by us in 1947. The newspaper reminded everyone in an editorial published on the matter: "This once again shows that the imperialist elements and their running dogs lurking in the Catholic Church will not be reconciled to their shameful failure. Under the instructions of imperialism, these reactionary elements not only used various conspiracies and tricks to sabotage our people's war of liberation, but now they are still using various conspiracies and tricks to sabotage our people's construction cause, attempting to make a desperate dying struggle." The newspaper called on the people of the province and all patriotic Catholics to learn a lesson from this case and increase their vigilance a hundredfold.
    A high degree of political vigilance is a powerful weapon to smash all conspiracies and sabotage activities of imperialist elements and other counter-revolutionary elements. Firmly grasping this weapon, using practical examples to expose the conspiracies and tricks of imperialism and its running dogs, and educating the people to engage in national construction with a revolutionary spirit of vigilance is the responsibility that our newspapers must not relax at all times. In this regard, newspapers should also constantly wage a resolute struggle against the emotions of complacency and vulgar self-satisfaction caused by victory, as well as the sloppy, careless, and inattentive style. On September 15, the Liberation Daily exposed a group of state workers who did not pay attention to protecting state secrets and seriously leaked secrets. Among them, some people lost 19 pieces of materials on counter-revolutionary elements in a snack bar, and some people read "top secret" documents on public vehicles. It is entirely necessary for the newspaper to bring these people who have lost vigilance into the sunlight and wake them up so that they do not continue to be numb and careless.

### 警惕性——我们的武器

    警惕性——我们的武器
    近几个月来不少报纸揭露了帝国主义利用天主教进行破坏活动的案件。通过这些案件的揭露，报纸鼓舞了广大人民进一步展开反帝爱国斗争，并向人们进行了提高警惕性的教育。
    上海解放日报就是一个突出的例子。解放日报配合着上海清除天主教内帝国主义分子及其他反革命分子斗争的开展，从六月份到九月份先后揭发了披着宗教外衣的帝国主义分子田望霖（比利时籍）等和翟光华（美国籍）等的间谍特务案两起，揭发了帝国主义分子马尔敦（法国籍）等在徐家汇圣母院育婴堂大批虐杀我国婴儿和窝藏包庇反革命分子的罪行，揭发了在帝国主义间谍和蒋匪军统局共谋下以天主教内的反动分子为领导核心的反革命组织“山东省民众救国团”的案件，揭发了帝国主义分子罗璋达（法国籍）等利用天主教“圣母小昆仲会”进行阴谋破坏活动的案件，等等。报纸在揭发这些案件的同时，还刊登了暴露帝国主义分子血腥罪行的许多图片和控诉文章，并对上海市举行的“帝国主义利用天主教进行阴谋破坏活动罪证展览会”作了生动的、详细的报道。这些案件的揭发，又一次深刻地教育了人们：帝国主义虽已接连遭到了失败，但他们必然要继续利用一切方式对我国进行捣乱和破坏。报纸对帝国主义分子的恶毒阴谋和罪恶活动的揭露，不仅激起了各界人民和爱国天主教徒的公愤，而且大大促进了人们的政治警觉性。家庭九代信教的天主教徒、上海恒通纱厂许升云在给解放日报的信中写道：“我从报上看到人民政府公安局在泰山公寓破获了帝国主义分子田望霖和林仁等利用天主教为掩护进行间谍活动的消息，又看了罪证展览会，使我真正认识了帝国主义分子假慈悲的丑恶面貌，他们暗藏在天主教内，利用宗教的名义来做间谍，收集情报，阴谋破坏新中国。我和全市爱国又虔诚信教的天主教教友一样，对这些帝国主义分子感到无限的愤怒。……现在我们都应该清醒过来，加强教友的团结，和全上海人民一起，坚决和潜藏在天主教内的帝国主义分子进行无情的斗争”；在信中他并揭露和斥责了某些帝国主义分子在人民政府破获间谍特务案件后的造谣破坏活动。
    除解放日报外，山东大众日报、福建日报、浙江日报、河北日报、天津日报等也曾揭发了当地以宗教为掩护的间谍特务案件。例如河北日报就曾在八月十七日公布了在献县等地破获的以张思谦、贾书善为首的反革命秘密破坏活动案。这是继一九四七年被我破获的献县天主教内国际间谍案件之后，又于同一地区再次出现的反革命秘密破坏活动案。报纸在为此事发表的社论中提醒大家说：“这就再次说明潜藏在天主教内的帝国主义分子及其走狗们是不会甘心他们可耻的失败的，这些反动分子在帝国主义的指使下不但使用过种种阴谋诡计破坏过我国人民的解放战争，现在他们还在使用种种阴谋诡计破坏我国人民的建设事业，企图作绝望的垂死的挣扎。”报纸号召全省人民和一切爱国的天主教徒从这一案件中吸取教训，百倍提高警惕。
    高度的政治警惕性，是粉碎帝国主义分子及其他反革命分子一切阴谋破坏的有力武器。紧紧掌握这一武器，用实际事例揭破帝国主义及其走狗的阴谋诡计，教育人民以革命警惕精神从事国家建设，是我们报纸时刻不能放松的责任。在这一方面，报纸还应该经常地向那种因胜利而麻痹大意、庸俗自安的情绪以及马马虎虎、漫不经心的作风进行坚决的斗争。解放日报在九月十五日揭露了一批不注意保护国家机密和严重失密的国家工作人员，其中有人将十九件反革命分子的材料遗失在小吃店中，有人在公共车辆上阅读“绝密”文件。报纸将这些丧失警惕性的人拉到太阳光底下，惊醒他们不要继续麻痹、马虎下去，是完全必要的。
