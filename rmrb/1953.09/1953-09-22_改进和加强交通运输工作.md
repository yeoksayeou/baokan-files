    Improving and Strengthening Transportation Work

    The transportation industry is an integral part of achieving national industrialization. With the growth of industrial and agricultural production, the expansion and acceleration of material circulation, and the needs of national defense construction, the important role of transportation work becomes more apparent. However, it is undeniable that the foundation of China's transportation industry is very weak. The number of ships and automobiles left over from old China was small, and most were dilapidated. After restoration and reorganization, these few modern transportation tools were able to play their due role and were combined with a large number of folk transportation tools such as mule carts and wooden sailboats to basically meet the needs of the national economy during the recovery phase. Measuring the tasks completed against the difficult conditions of the past, there is no doubt that significant achievements have been made. However, the tasks ahead are becoming more onerous, and there are still many difficulties. How to further utilize existing transportation equipment, give full play to the potential of existing equipment, manage the current transportation industry well, and provide high-quality, low-cost, and large-volume transportation capacity under the overall national plan to complete national transportation tasks is an important issue for current transportation work.

    The main shortcomings in the current transportation work, as pointed out by the National Transportation Conference, are that business management is still in a backward and chaotic state. The most prominent manifestations are high transportation costs, low efficiency, complicated procedures, and many accidents. The root cause lies in the failure to completely eliminate capitalist management thinking.

    In the first half of this year, the actual production of the state-owned maritime transport system decreased by 11 percent compared with the same period last year, while the actual total cost increased by 35 percent. There are also many enterprises that only know how to pursue profits, without regard to business management, blindly compete, monopolize sources of goods, seek profit only, set up large stalls, have bloated organizations, and huge expenditures. For example, the Yangtze River Navigation Administration blindly increased personnel, exceeding the establishment by 39 percent. There were more than 2,400 people in the intermodal transport agencies in Anhui Province that are being shut down; the Hefei Intermodal Transport Company used 350 people to handle 20 tons of freight; the Yanbei Automobile Company had only 19 vehicles, but more than 100 employees, and the working capital accounted for more than 2 billion yuan, which was not enough to cover expenses, so they resorted to ideas from freight and handling fees. These are precisely manifestations of capitalist management thinking.

    The National Transportation Conference adopted strict criticism and self-criticism, exposing and criticizing the tendencies of bureaucracy, subjectivism, and decentralism in transportation work, as well as the neglect of political and ideological work, and especially focused on exposing and criticizing capitalist management thinking, enabling everyone to understand the essence of the current problems and made a correct analysis of the basic situation of the current transportation work, and put forward the guiding principles and tasks for future work. This is timely and necessary. This will greatly advance future transportation work.

    It should be emphasized that state-owned transportation enterprises of a socialist nature should not only increase the accumulation of the state and enterprises by improving business management and striving to reduce costs; more importantly, they should serve industrial and agricultural production and urban and rural material exchanges under the unified leadership and planning of the Central Government, first and foremost serving national industrialization, and not blindly pursuing unreasonable profits. Managing enterprises well and improving business technology must rely on the consciousness of the workers, the laboring people, and the wisdom of the masses, and not on huge management institutions. The central task of the people of the whole country is to fight for national industrialization, and the transportation industry will gradually and selectively seek corresponding development along with the process of national industrialization. Therefore, we must make full use of existing equipment, give play to potential forces, and improve transportation efficiency. This requires reducing costs, saving management expenses, promoting advanced experience, improving labor organization, mastering the flow of materials, organizing overall and rational transportation, and overcoming conservative thinking, in order to achieve low transportation costs, high efficiency, good quality, large volume, and safe passenger and freight transportation. The so-called large volume here must be combined with the needs of industrial and agricultural production and commodity circulation. It is unrealistic and wrong to blindly solicit sources of goods that are divorced from production and the needs of the people. The National Transportation Conference has solved these problems and is a starting point for doing a good job in future work.

    The National Transportation Conference also focused on discussing how to improve and strengthen local transportation work, which is also necessary. Because the potential contained in local transportation is very large and is an important aspect of completing transportation tasks in the future. The Soviet Union's 1927 instructions on formulating the Five-Year Plan for the National Economy stated: "Whether in expanding line construction and mechanizing transportation tools, special attention should be paid to the development of local transportation, especially in areas where commerce is developing. The local organs of the Soviet regime should pay special attention to using the strength and resources of local residents and local Soviets to solve this problem, because the insufficient development of local transportation is one of the most important reasons for the backwardness of rural technology and culture." China has a vast territory, abundant resources, and a large population, but there are very few railways, and whether on land or at sea, the main focus is on trunk line transportation. Local transportation has not received sufficient attention in the past; but local transportation is a powerful assistant to these trunk line transportation, playing the role of capillaries and arteries depending on each other. Local transportation is closely related to workers, peasants, handicraftsmen, and especially to the vast number of peasants. Therefore, to improve the political, cultural, and technical level of the countryside, to meet the peasants' demands for industrial products, to supply industrial raw materials, and to supply agricultural products to industrial and mining areas and cities, it is necessary to actively develop local transportation. In the past, various places were busy with more important central tasks such as social reforms, and it was difficult to take care of local transportation work. Some areas have begun to pay attention to it, but in general, local transportation still cannot meet the needs of urban and rural material exchanges. In the future, this aspect of work should be appropriately strengthened to better serve national industrialization, expand urban and rural material exchanges, and serve the material and cultural life of the broad masses of people.

    The National Transportation Conference formulated the guidelines and tasks for local transportation work that meet the requirements of national key construction; emphasized starting from the actual situation, managing existing transportation undertakings well, giving full play to the capabilities of all existing transportation tools and equipment, and striving to gradually improve and improve; emphasized the need to implement relying on the leadership of local party committees and governments, combining local needs, and relying on local people's strength and financial resources, and using local materials to engage in local transportation construction. The conference clarified the idea of key construction, pointing out that local transportation undertakings must be subordinate to the needs of the entire national economic construction and the lives of the broad masses of the people. This must be resolutely implemented.

    In the organizational management of local transportation, we must also pay attention to the use of backward transportation tools. Because nearly four million tons of wooden sailboats and millions of mule carts, as well as other folk transportation tools, are objectively existing, dispersed in all corners of a large transportation army. Fully organizing and giving play to the power of these backward transportation tools, not only in the past, but also in a long period to come, will still play a major role in urban and rural material exchanges. In the past, the phenomenon of letting things go or managing them too rigidly in some areas must be corrected. In the future, all localities should improve and strengthen the organizational management of these transportation tools according to their characteristics and transportation needs. This is not only a major economic task, but also a political and mass work of great significance. Of course, in terms of business management and development direction, modern tools should be the main focus, which is also certain.

    Local transportation, in addition to completing transportation tasks within the region and some transportation tasks entrusted to the region by the state, is mainly to meet the needs of the local people. Local transportation also has the characteristics of complexity, dispersion, and diversity, involving many policy-related and mass-related issues. Therefore, the National Transportation Conference decided that local transportation work should be led by local party committees and local governments, and the Central Ministry of Transportation should mainly grasp the guidance of principles and policies, and provide assistance in business technology. This division of labor is suitable for the nature and characteristics of local transportation work and the needs of regional work, and it is also in line with the principle of centralization and unity without hindering flexibility in adapting to local conditions. In the future, party committees and governments at all levels should appropriately strengthen their leadership over the work of local transportation departments, adjust and improve local transportation institutions; local transportation departments must strengthen their requests for instructions and reports to local party committees and governments, and closely rely on the leadership of local party committees and governments. This is the key to improving local transportation work.

    In order to implement the spirit of the National Transportation Conference to meet the huge transportation tasks of the country during the period of economic construction, transportation departments at all levels must resolutely rely on the leadership of party committees and governments at all levels, closely cooperate with all relevant departments, specifically arrange their own work; at the same time, they must resolutely oppose bureaucracy, subjectivism, and decentralism, and earnestly correct capitalist management thinking and management methods, strengthen political and ideological work, vigorously carry out production reforms, gradually establish a planned management system, and constantly improve the political and professional level of staff. Only in this way can we improve transportation work and adapt it to the growing needs of the national economy and serve national industrialization.

    改进和加强交通运输工作
    交通事业是实现国家工业化的有机组成部分。随着工农业生产的增长，物资流转的扩大和加速，以及国防建设的需要，交通运输工作的重要作用更为明显。但不可否认的，我国交通事业的基础非常薄弱。旧中国遗留下来的轮船、汽车为数不多而且大多破烂；经过恢复整理，才使这些仅有的近代运输工具发挥了应有的作用，并与为数众多的民间运输工具——骡马大车、木帆船等结合起来，基本上适应了国民经济在恢复阶段的需要。以过去困难的条件，来衡量完成的任务，无疑是有显著成绩的。但是今后任务益重，目前困难尚多，如何进一步利用现有的交通运输设备，充分发挥现有设备的潜在能力，管好现在的交通事业，使它在国家整个计划之下，提供质好、价廉、量大的运输力，完成国家运输任务，这是当前交通工作的重要问题。
    目前交通工作中存在的主要缺点，正如全国交通会议所指出的，是企业经营管理上仍处于落后和混乱的状态。集中突出的表现是运输费用高、效率低、手续繁、事故多。其根源在于资本主义的经营管理思想未被彻底肃清。
    今年上半年国营海运系统的实际生产比去年同期减少百分之十一，实际总成本却增加了百分之三十五。还有不少企业只知追逐利润，不问经营管理，盲目竞争，垄断货源，唯利是图，铺大摊子，机构臃肿，开支浩大。例如长江航务管理局盲目增加人员，超过了编制百分之三十九。安徽省在结束中的联运机构就有二千四百多人；合肥市的联运公司以三百五十人办理二十吨的货运；雁北汽车公司仅有车十九辆，人员却有一百多，流动资金占了二十多亿元，不够开支，竟从运费和手续费中打主意。这些正是资本主义经营思想的表现。
    这次全国交通会议采用了严格的批评和自我批评，揭露和批判了交通工作中的官僚主义、主观主义和分散主义以及忽视政治思想工作的偏向，特别着重揭露和批判了资本主义的经营管理思想，使大家对目前存在的问题深入到本质来认识，并针对目前交通工作的基本情况做了正确的分析，提出了今后工作的方针任务。这是适时的和必要的。这将使今后交通工作大大地前进一步。
    应该强调指出：社会主义性质的国营运输企业，不仅是要从改善经营管理、力求降低成本中来增加国家和企业的积累；更重要的是要在中央统一领导和计划下，为工农业生产服务，为城乡物资交流服务，首先是为国家工业化服务，而决不是盲目追逐不合理的利润。管好企业，提高业务技术，是要依靠职工群众、劳动人民的自觉、群众的智慧，而决不是依靠庞大的管理机构。当前全国人民的中心任务是为国家工业化而斗争，交通运输事业将随着国家工业化的进程，逐步地有重点地求得相应的发展。因此，我们必须充分利用现有设备，发挥潜在力量，提高运输效率。这就必须降低成本，节约管理费用，推广先进经验，改善劳动组织，掌握物资流向，组织整体的合理的运输，克服保守思想，以求运输费用低、效率高、质量好、运量大、客货运输安全。这里所谓运量大，是要与工农业生产和商品流通的需要相结合的，一切脱离生产和人民需要而盲目招揽货源是不切实际的和错误的。全国交通会议解决了这些问题，是做好今后工作的一个起点。
    全国交通会议还着重讨论了如何改进与加强地方交通工作，这也是必要的。因为在地方交通中所蕴藏的潜力很大，是今后完成运输任务的一个重要方面。苏联一九二七年关于拟定国民经济五年计划的指示中曾提出：“无论在扩大线路建设与运输工具机械化方面，都应特别注意发展地方性的运输，首先是在商业发展的地区。苏维埃政权各地方机关应特别注意利用当地居民和地方苏维埃底力量与资材来解决这一问题，因为地方性运输发展不充分，乃是乡村技术落后与文化落后的最重要原因之一。”我国地大物博，人口众多，现有铁路却很少，而且无论在陆上和海上，主要的是干线运输，地方交通过去没有受到充分重视；但地方性运输对这些干线运输来说是一个有力的助手，起着微血管对大动脉互相依存的作用。地方交通对工人、农民、手工业者，特别是对广大农民有密切关系。因此要提高农村的政治、文化、技术水平，要满足农民对工业品的要求，要将工业原料以及将农产品供应工矿和城市的需要，就不能不积极发展地方性的交通运输事业。过去因各地忙于更重要的社会改革等中心工作，对地方交通工作难于兼顾，目前有些地区已开始重视，但一般说来，地方交通仍不能适应城乡物资交流的需要。今后应适当加强这方面的工作，使它更好地为国家工业化、为扩大城乡物资交流、为广大人民的物质与文化生活服务。
    全国交通会议制定了符合国家重点建设要求的地方交通工作的方针和任务；强调了从现实情况出发，管好现有交通事业，充分发挥现有一切交通运输工具和设备的能力，并力求逐步改进和提高；强调要贯彻依靠地方党政领导，结合当地需要和依靠地方民力、财力、就地取材的办法来从事地方交通建设。会议明确了重点建设的思想，指出地方交通事业，必须服从于整个国家经济建设和广大人民生活的需要。这是必须坚决执行的。
    我们在地方交通的组织管理工作中，还必须注意利用落后的运输工具。因为近四百万吨的木帆船和几百万辆的骡马大车，以及其他各种民间运输工具，是客观存在的、分散在各个角落的一支运输大军。充分组织与发挥这些落后运输工具的力量，不仅在过去，就是在今后一个很长的时期内，对城乡物资交流仍将起重大的作用。过去有些地区放任自流或管得太死的现象，都必须纠正。今后各地应根据这些运输工具的特点和运输上的需要，改进与加强对它们的组织管理工作。这不仅是一件重大的经济工作，同时也是具有重大意义的政治工作和群众工作。当然在经营管理和发展方向上，应以近代工具为主，这也是肯定的。
    地方性的运输，除了为完成地区范围内的运输任务和一部分国家委托该地区的运输任务以外，主要是为满足当地人民的需要的。地方交通又具有复杂、分散、多样性的特点，涉及政策性、群众性的问题很多。因此全国交通会议确定地方交通工作由地方党委和地方政府负责领导，中央交通部主要掌握方针政策的指导，并在业务技术上予以帮助。这种分工是适合地方交通工作的性质、特点和地区工作需要的，这也是符合于集中统一而又不妨害因地制宜的灵活性的原则的。今后，各地党委和政府应适当加强对地方交通部门工作的领导，调整和健全地方交通机构；各地交通部门则必须加强向当地党委、政府请示报告，紧密依靠当地党委和政府的领导。这是改进地方交通工作的关键。
    为了贯彻全国交通会议的精神以迎接国家在经济建设时期巨大的运输任务，各级交通部门必须坚决依靠各地党委和政府的领导，和各有关部门密切配合，具体安排自己的工作；同时要坚决反对官僚主义、主观主义和分散主义，并认真地纠正资本主义的经营思想和经营方式，加强政治思想工作，大力进行生产改革，逐步建立计划管理制度，不断地提高工作人员政治和业务水平。只有这样，才能改进交通工作，使之适应于国民经济日益增长的需要，为国家工业化而服务。
