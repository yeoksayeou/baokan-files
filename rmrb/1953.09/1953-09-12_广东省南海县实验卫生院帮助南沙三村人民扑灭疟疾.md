    The Experimental Health Institute of Nanhai County, Guangdong Province, Helps the People of Nansha Three Villages Eradicate Malaria
    Yu Senjin of the Experimental Health Institute of Nanhai County, Guangdong, writes: Nansha Three Villages in Nanhai County has low-lying terrain, is rife with malaria mosquitoes, and has very poor environmental hygiene. In the past, malaria epidemics occurred every year.

    Over the past two years, with the care and assistance of the People's Government, the face of the village has completely changed. Last year, the Experimental Health Institute of Nanhai County sent doctors to Nansha to treat farmers and investigate the causes of local malaria epidemics. This year, the institute sent an anti-malaria team to Nansha Three Villages to carry out medical and malaria prevention work. In March alone, they provided 997 free treatments, and all sick farmers received treatment. Under the guidance and assistance of the anti-malaria team, the environmental hygiene of Nansha Three Villages has also been greatly improved. Many depressions have been filled, stagnant water has been drained, and all farmers' homes have undergone several major cleanings. The Nanhai County People's Government also allocated 20 million yuan for farmers to purchase mosquito nets. On the evening of August 6th, the Nanhai Experimental Health Institute also screened movies in the village to educate farmers on how to fight against disease. Through the above measures, Nansha Three Villages has basically met the requirements for mobilizing the masses to prevent malaria. Many farmers gratefully said: "In the past, we knew our own hardships, and no one cared if we died of illness. Only the People's Government can care about us like this." Some farmers said: "Our health is better, and our production is also guaranteed."

专栏：读者来信摘要

    广东省南海县实验卫生院帮助南沙三村人民扑灭疟疾
    广东南海县实验卫生院余森津来信：南海县南沙三村地势低洼，疟蚊遍生，环境卫生很坏，过去每年都有疟疾流行。
    两年来，在人民政府的关怀和帮助下，该村的面貌完全改变了。去年，南海县实验卫生院派了医生到南沙替农民看病，并调查了当地疟疾流行的原因。今年该院又派了一个防疟小组到南沙三村去，展开医疗和预防疟疾工作。仅三月份一个月，就免费诊治九百九十七次，患病的农民都得到了治疗。在防疟小组的指导和帮助下，南沙三村的环境卫生也大大改善了。不少洼地已被填平，积水已被排除，所有农户家里也都进行过几次大扫除。南海县人民政府还拨了二千万元给农民购买蚊帐。八月六日晚上，南海实验卫生院又在该村放映电影，教育农民怎样和疾病作斗争。经过以上措施，南沙三村已基本上达到了发动群众预防疟疾的要求。许多农民都感激地说：过去我们辛苦自家知，病死了也没有人问，只有人民自己的政府才能这样关心我们。有的农民说：我们的身体健康了，生产也有保障了。
