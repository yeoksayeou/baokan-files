Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 2nd (TASS): In recent days, final election rallies have been held in West German cities, workers' residential areas, and villages, with the candidates of the German Communist Party receiving broad support from the masses.

According to the German News Agency, large rallies attended by tens of thousands of people were held in Hamburg and Bremen earlier this week, where German Communist Party Chairman Max Reimann delivered speeches. Simultaneously, the German Communist Party also held election rallies in Wuppertal, Aachen, and Minden. German Communist Party Bundestag candidates F. Reiche, J. Ledwin, and F. Heitner delivered speeches at these rallies, calling on voters to vote for the German Communist Party candidates on September 6 to overthrow the Adenauer government.

Speaking at the rally in Wuppertal, F. Reiche cited numerous examples illustrating the disastrous consequences of the Bonn government's economic policies. Addressing the election rally in Aachen, Heitner, a member of the German Communist Party Central Committee, pointed out the significant importance of the Soviet government's new note on the German question and the agreements reached during the Soviet-German Moscow talks. He called on voters to vote for the German Communist Party candidates to ensure the formation of a government prepared to reach an agreement. Heitner said amidst the stormy applause of the rally participants: "As long as all the democratic and peaceful forces of the German people act in unity, we will be able to establish a unified, peaceful, and independent Germany." J. Ledwin, speaking at the Minden election rally, mentioned the huge amount of reparations and occupation costs that West Germany has to pay annually. He emphasized that if these billions of marks were used for the people, the German people would enjoy unprecedented prosperity.

In these days, many candidates of the German Social Democratic Party have also addressed West German voters, exposing the policies of the Bonn Adenauer government. For example, Müller-Dostali, the Social Democratic Party Bundestag candidate for the city of Essen, accused the Bonn government at a youth rally of "delaying negotiations between eastern and western Germany in an act bordering on treason." Müller-Dostali pointed out that the Adenauer government is trying to hinder the conclusion of an agreement between the major powers, because such an agreement would ease international tensions.

The reactionary parties of the Bonn Adenauer group are trying every means to secure victory in the elections. They are stepping up their slander and malicious propaganda, and resorting to horrific terror tactics before the elections to deal with West German democratic and peace-loving forces. Fascist thugs they have bought off have torn down the German Communist Party's election slogans, beaten workers who posted slogans calling on voters to overthrow Adenauer in the elections, and used hooligan methods to prevent election rallies from being held. Members of the fascist "German Youth League," with the active support of the police, are carrying out conspiracies to disrupt the German Communist Party's election rallies; on several occasions, rallies where Social Democratic Party Bundestag candidates and representatives of West German patriotic and democratic forces were speaking have also been disrupted.

    德共候选人在竞选运动中获得人民广泛拥护
    阿登纳集团使用恐怖手段迫害西德民主力量
    【新华社四日讯】据塔斯社柏林二日讯：最近几天来，西德各城市、各工人住宅区和各乡村，都在举行最后的竞选大会，德国共产党的候选人得到群众的广泛拥护。
    据德意志通讯社报道，本星期初，在汉堡和不来梅举行了成千成万人参加的大会，德国共产党主席马克斯·雷曼在这些大会上发表了演说。与此同时，德国共产党还在窝伯塔尔、亚琛、敏顿召开了竞选大会。德国共产党联邦议院候选人弗·雷熙、约·莱德温、弗·海特纳在这些大会上发表了演说，号召选民在九月六日投票选举德国共产党的候选人，以推翻阿登纳政府。
    在窝伯塔尔的大会上发表演说的弗·雷熙举出了许许多多的例子，说明波恩政府经济政策所造成的灾难性的后果。德共中央委员会委员海特纳在亚琛的竞选大会上发表演说时指出，苏联政府关于德国问题的新照会和苏德莫斯科会谈所达成的协议，具有重大的意义。他并号召选民投票选举德国共产党的候选人，以保证成立一个准备达成协议的政府。海特纳在集会者暴风雨般的掌声中说：“只要德国人民的一切民主、和平的力量团结一致地行动，我们就能够建立起一个统一、和平、独立的德国。”约·莱德温在敏顿的竞选集会上演说，提到西德每年要支付巨额的赔款和占领费。他着重指出，如果把这成十亿的钱用之于人民，那么德国人民就会得到空前未有的繁荣。
    在这些日子里，德国社会民主党的许多候选人也向西德选民发表演说，揭露波恩阿登纳政府的政策。例如，埃森城社会民主党联邦议院候选人缪勒—多斯塔利，在一个青年集会上指责波恩政府“拖延德国东部与西部之间的谈判是一种近乎叛国的行为。”缪勒—多斯塔利指出：阿登纳政府竭力阻碍大国间达成协议，因为这种协议将会缓和国际紧张局势。
    波恩阿登纳集团各反动党派正在千方百计地使自己在选举中获得胜利，它们加紧进行污蔑和恶意宣传，在选举前施行骇人听闻的恐怖政策来对付西德民主和爱好和平的势力。它们所收买的法西斯恶棍撕毁了德国共产党的竞选标语，殴打了那些张贴号召选民在选举中推翻阿登纳的标语的工人，并采用流氓手段阻止举行竞选大会。法西斯“德国青年联盟”的分子在警察的积极支持下，进行破坏德国共产党竞选大会的阴谋；有几次，对社会民主党联邦议院候选人发表演说的大会和西德爱国民主势力的代表发表演说的大会也进行破坏。
