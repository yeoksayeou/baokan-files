Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, September 23rd: The Chinese Communist Party's Chinese People's Volunteer Army Committee issued instructions on September 19th to all levels of the Chinese Communist Party organizations within the Volunteer Army, calling on all Party members to unite all commanders and combatants to conscientiously cherish the property of the motherland and practice strict economy. The instructions pointed out: Under the full support of the people of the motherland, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, together with the Korean People's Army, has achieved victory. In the past arduous war, all Communist Party members, commanders, and combatants in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army achieved great success in cherishing the motherland's materials, practicing strict economy, and tightening expenditures. This year is the first year of the motherland's Five-Year Plan for economic construction, and we need to cherish all the country's resources even more conscientiously, practice strict economy, and tighten expenditures so that the country can devote more resources to major construction projects and ensure the successful completion of the national construction plan.

The instructions require leaders at all levels in the army to conscientiously educate Party members and educate the troops so that all comrades deeply understand that cherishing the motherland's resources and practicing strict economy are concrete manifestations of cherishing the motherland. All comrades should be educated to cherish weapons, ammunition, vehicles, horses, fuel, and all kinds of equipment and materials, and to cherish every gun, every bullet, every needle, and every thread given by the motherland. The instructions also require everyone to conduct a careful inspection and inventory of all materials, and leaders at all levels should formulate practical and feasible savings plans based on specific circumstances. The instructions call on commanders and fighters of the entire Volunteer Army to take active action, practice strict economy, and carry forward the fine tradition of our Party and our People's Army in serving the people with hard work and dedication.
