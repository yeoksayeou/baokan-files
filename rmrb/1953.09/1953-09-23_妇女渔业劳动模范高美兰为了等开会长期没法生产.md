    Women's Fishery Labor Model Gao Meilan Unable to Produce Long-Term Due to Waiting for a Meeting
    Reader Bohai writes: This spring, Gao Meilan, a women's fishery labor model from Qin Island Township, Changshan Island Special District, Laiyang Prefecture, Shandong Province, organized a women's production team, preparing to go to sea to catch knife fish. However, the person in charge of the Qin Island Township Party organization said that they had received a notice from the Special District Women's Federation, asking Gao Meilan to attend the Shandong Provincial Women's Congress, so they asked Gao Meilan to stay at home. Gao Meilan stayed for a long time, but the meeting was still not held, so she requested to go out to sea. However, Wang Huaqin, the responsible comrade of the Qin Island Township Party organization, said: "No! You have to attend the meeting, what will happen if you leave! 'Individual interests must be subordinate to overall interests'!"
    Until now, almost half a year has passed, but there is still no news of the meeting, and the season for catching knife fish has passed. Gao Meilan's production suffered a great loss, and the women's production team also collapsed as a result. Gao Meilan said distressfully: "I can't be a model anymore! If I'm just asked to wait at home for a meeting, how can I still play a leading role in production?"

    妇女渔业劳动模范高美兰为了等开会长期没法生产
    读者渤海来信：今春，山东省莱阳专区长山岛特区钦岛乡妇女渔业劳动模范高美兰组织了一个妇女生产组，准备出海打刀鱼。但当时钦岛乡党组织的负责人说是已得到特区妇联通知，要高美兰出席山东省妇女代表会议，就让高美兰留在家里。高美兰留下好久，会议还没有开，于是又要求出海。但钦岛乡党组织负责同志王华琴说：“不行啊！你要去出席会议，走了怎么办！‘个人利益要服从整体利益’呀！”
    直到现在，时间过了快半年，会议还是没有音信，打刀鱼的季节却过去了。高美兰的生产受到很大损失，妇女生产组也因此垮了台。高美兰苦恼地说：“我这个模范要当不起了！光让我在家里等开会，我怎样还能在生产中起带头作用呢？”
