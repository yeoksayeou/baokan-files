Xinhua News Agency, September 24th, Dispatch from New York by TASS: The United Nations General Assembly held a meeting on the afternoon of September 22 to discuss the report of the General Committee regarding the two supplementary items proposed by the Soviet Union. These two items are: (1) "Memorandum by the Secretary-General on the implementation of the third resolution adopted by the General Assembly on August 28, 1953"; (2) "Measures for eliminating the threat of another world war and reducing international tension."

    Andrei Yanuarevich Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation, stated in his speech that it was necessary to include the motion "Memorandum by the Secretary-General on the implementation of the third resolution adopted by the General Assembly on August 28, 1953" on the agenda.

    Representatives from Poland, the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, and Czechoslovakia spoke successively, unanimously advocating the adoption of the Soviet proposal to include the Secretary-General's memorandum on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly.

    The Polish representative, Katz-Suchy, pointed out that if the United Nations did not consider and discuss the new proposals of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea regarding the political conference, it would not be fulfilling its responsibilities. He said: Attempts to force one-sided decisions on the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will not succeed. Referring to the statement by the US representative Lodge that the political conference itself could decide on the participation of neutral countries in the work of the conference, he pointed out that this vague promise was a trick to cover up the irreconcilable attitude of the US government on the issue of the political conference—an attitude that completely disregards the interests of Asian countries.

    The representative of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, Kiselev, pointed out that the US insistence on a "two-sided" conference was unreasonable and violated the armistice agreement.

    The Czechoslovak representative, David, emphasized in his speech that excluding Asian countries from the conference would not be conducive to the success of the political conference.

    The US and British representatives spoke against the Soviet proposal to include the Secretary-General's memorandum on the agenda.

    Subsequently, the General Assembly put to a vote the General Committee's report not to include the Secretary-General's memorandum on the agenda. Representatives from eight countries—the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Byelorussia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Indonesia, Burma, and Sweden—voted against the proposal. Representatives from ten countries—Iraq, Yemen, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, Guatemala, Argentina, and Yugoslavia—abstained. The Indian representative did not participate in the vote. Forty countries, including the United States, Britain, and France, voted in favor of the General Committee's proposal (i.e., against the Soviet proposal).

    Afterward, the General Assembly unanimously adopted another recommendation from the General Committee, with one abstention, to include the item proposed by the Soviet delegation, "Measures for eliminating the threat of another world war and reducing international tension," on the agenda and to refer it to the Political Committee for discussion. The plenary session of the General Assembly then adjourned.

    According to Xinhua News Agency: The General Committee of the United Nations General Assembly held a meeting on September 22 to discuss the Soviet request to include two supplementary items on the agenda of this session of the General Assembly. These two items are: (1) "Memorandum by the Secretary-General on the implementation of the third resolution adopted by the General Assembly on August 28, 1953." (2) "Measures for eliminating the threat of another world war and reducing international tension."

    At the morning session, Andrei Yanuarevich Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation, spoke. He explained why the Soviet delegation believed it was necessary to include the first supplementary item on the agenda. He emphasized that the Korean question has always occupied an important position not only in the discussions of the Seventh UN General Assembly, but also in the discussions of the UN General Assembly in all sessions since the beginning of the Korean War. This shows that the UN General Assembly believes that it must participate in resolving all issues arising from the war imposed on the Korean people, mainly all issues arising from ending the war.

    Vyshinsky further elaborated on the issue of the membership of the Korean political conference. He said that both in the past and now, we believe that the American interpretation is wrong, and we maintain the position supported by other delegations, accounting for one-third of all UN member states. Our proposition is to hold a round table conference. That is to say, this conference should not be limited to the belligerent parties, but should be a conference jointly held by the belligerent parties plus other countries that are concerned about the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and are concerned about the successful conduct and satisfactory conclusion of the political conference.

    Vyshinsky emphasized the importance of the Secretary-General's report. He said, "The significance of the "third" resolution should be understood as the Secretary-General should submit a report to the UN General Assembly. Therefore, the Secretary-General's practice of submitting his brief report to the UN General Assembly is correct. Vyshinsky then asked, if the UN General Assembly believes that this issue should not be discussed further at this time, then what is the point of the "third" resolution stipulating that a report be submitted?

    Vyshinsky said that we attach great importance to the question of whether the General Assembly should discuss the report. We believe that the intention of the General Assembly expressed in the "third" resolution can only have the intention of discussing this issue in order to achieve a satisfactory solution. The General Assembly cannot take a neutral stance on this issue, let alone evade it, because it concerns the interests of the entire world and is also a direct task of the United Nations to maintain peace.

    The US representative, Lodge, spoke, opposing the Soviet delegation's proposal to include the item of discussing the Secretary-General's memorandum on the agenda. He said that the issue of the participation of India and other neutral countries in the political conference could be decided at the political conference or through pre-conference consultations between representatives of the belligerent parties.

    The British representative, Lloyd, supported Lodge's opinion. Representatives from France, Belgium, El Salvador, Canada, and Venezuela also opposed reconsidering the issue of the political conference. The Polish representative, Katz-Suchy, spoke to express his full support for the Soviet proposal.

    Near the end of the morning session, Vyshinsky spoke again. He pointed out that the statements of Lodge, Lloyd, and others who opposed the Soviet motion were completely untenable. He said that Lodge indicated that he continued to support the resolution on the composition of the political conference adopted by the Seventh General Assembly on August 28. At the same time, Lodge contradicted himself by saying that the issue of the composition of the political conference should be resolved by the political conference itself. The illogicality of Lodge's position was so obvious that Vyshinsky's words caused a long burst of laughter in the hall.

    After Vyshinsky's speech, the Soviet proposal was put to a vote. The Soviet Union and Poland voted in favor, while representatives from ten countries, including the United States, Britain, and France, voted against.

    At the afternoon session, the committee unanimously adopted the Soviet proposal to include the proposal "Measures for eliminating the threat of another world war and reducing international tension" on the agenda. The committee adopted the Polish proposal to refer this issue to the General Assembly's Political Committee for discussion.

### 苏联巩固和平提案列入联大议程  维辛斯基斥责美国对政治会议的无理态度

    苏联巩固和平提案列入联大议程
    维辛斯基斥责美国对政治会议的无理态度
    【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社纽约二十三日讯：联合国大会于九月二十二日下午举行会议，讨论总务委员会关于苏联提出的两个补充项目的报告。这两个项目是：（一）“秘书长关于一九五三年八月二十八日大会通过的第三项决议案的执行情况的备忘录”，（二）“关于消除另一次世界大战的威胁和缓和国际紧张局势的措施”。
    苏联代表团团长安·扬·维辛斯基在发言中，说明有必要将“秘书长关于一九五三年八月二十八日大会通过的第三项决议案的执行情况的备忘录”这一项动议列入议程。
    波兰、白俄罗斯共和国、捷克斯洛伐克的代表相继发言，他们一致主张通过苏联提出的将秘书长的备忘录列入联合国大会议程的建议。
    波兰代表卡茨—苏希指出，联合国假如不考虑并讨论中华人民共和国及朝鲜民主主义人民共和国关于政治会议的新建议，就是没有履行它的责任。他说：强使中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国接受片面决定的企图是不会成功的。他在谈到美国代表洛奇所说的政治会议本身能够决定中立国参加会议工作问题时，指出：这种含糊其词的诺言是耍花样，目的是要掩饰美国政府在政治会议问题上的不能和解的态度——一种完全无视亚洲国家的利益的态度。
    白俄罗斯共和国代表基谢列夫指出，美国坚持“两方”会议的态度是毫无理由的，而且违反停战协定。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表戴维在发言中强调指出，把亚洲国家排斥在会议之外，对于政治会议的成功是毫无裨益的。
    美国代表和英国代表发言反对苏联关于把秘书长的备忘录列入议程的建议。
    接着，大会把总务委员会所提不把秘书长备忘录列入大会议程的报告提付表决。苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、印尼、缅甸、瑞典八个国家的代表投票反对这个建议。伊拉克、也门、阿富汗、沙特阿拉伯、叙利亚、黎巴嫩、埃及、危地马拉、阿根廷、南斯拉夫十个国家的代表团弃权。印度代表没有参加表决。包括美、英、法在内的四十个国家投票赞成总务委员会的建议（即反对苏联的建议）。
    随后，大会除一票弃权外一致通过了总务委员会的另一项建议，即把苏联代表团提出的“关于消除另一次世界大战的威胁和缓和国际紧张局势的措施”项目列入大会议程，并转交政治委员会讨论。大会全体会议至此休会。
    据新华社讯：联合国大会总务委员会九月二十二日举行会议，讨论苏联要求把两个补充项目列入本届大会议程的动议，这两个项目是：（一）“秘书长关于一九五三年八月二十八日大会通过的第三项决议案的执行情况的备忘录”。（二）“关于消除另一次世界大战的威胁和缓和国际紧张局势的措施”。
    在上午会议上，苏联代表团团长安·扬·维辛斯基发言。他说明为什么苏联代表团认为有必要将第一项补充项目列入议程。他着重指出朝鲜问题不仅在联合国第七届大会的讨论中，而且在朝鲜战争开始以来的联合国历届大会的讨论中一向占重要地位。这说明，联合国大会认为它必须参与解决因强加在朝鲜人民头上的战争而引起的一切问题，主要是结束战争所引起的一切问题。
    维辛斯基进一步详细说明了关于朝鲜政治会议的成员问题。他说，我们不论在以前和现在都认为美国的解释是错误的，我们维护占全体联合国会员国三分之一的其它代表团所支持的主张。我们的主张就是要举行圆桌会议。这就是说，这个会议不应该局限于交战双方，而应该是一个由交战双方加上其它关心和平解决朝鲜问题、关心政治会议的成功进行与圆满结束的国家共同举行的会议。
    维辛斯基着重指出了秘书长报告的重要性。他说，“第三项”决议案的意义应该被了解为秘书长应向联合国大会提出报告。因此，秘书长向联合国大会提出他的简短报告这种做法是正确的。维辛斯基接着问道，假如联合国大会认为现在不应该继续就这个问题进行讨论，那么“第三项”决议案规定提出一个报告，又有什么意思呢？
    维辛斯基说，我们十分重视大会要不要对报告进行讨论的问题。我们认为“第三项”决议案中所表达的大会的意愿，除了希望讨论这个问题，以求圆满解决以外，不可能有其他含意。大会对这个问题不能采取中立立场，更不能规避这个问题，因为它关系整个世界的利益，并且也是联合国分内的一项维护和平的直接任务。
    美国代表洛奇发言，他反对苏联代表团提出的关于把讨论秘书长备忘录的项目列入大会议程的建议。他说，关于印度和其他中立国家参加政治会议的问题，可以在政治会议上去决定，或者由交战双方代表举行会前协商来决定。
    英国代表劳埃德支持洛奇的意见。法国、比利时、萨尔瓦多、加拿大和委内瑞拉的代表，也反对再度考虑政治会议的问题。波兰代表卡茨—苏希发言表示完全支持苏联建议。
    在上午会议接近结束时，维辛斯基再次发言。他指出，洛奇、劳埃德和其它反对苏联动议的人们的说法，是完全站不住脚的。他说，洛奇表示他继续支持七届大会在八月二十八日通过的关于政治会议组成问题的决议。同时，洛奇又自相矛盾地说，政治会议的组成问题，应该由政治会议本身加以解决。洛奇立场的不合逻辑是这样明显，以致维辛斯基的话在会场上引起了长时间的哄堂大笑。
    维辛斯基发言结束后，苏联建议付表决。苏联和波兰投票赞成，包括美、英、法在内的十国代表投票反对。
    在下午会议上，委员会一致通过把苏联所提“关于消除另一次世界大战的威胁和缓和国际紧张局势的措施”的建议列入议程。委员会通过了波兰所提把这一问题交由大会政治委员会讨论的建议。
