Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 23rd: Polish personnel of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC) assigned to South Korea to inspect the work of the NNSC inspection teams, were involved in an aircraft crash on the 19th while flying from Gunsan to Busan. This was due to the irresponsible attitude of the US side towards the safety of NNSC personnel, resulting in four Polish personnel being injured. It is worth noting that this incident occurred after a series of obstructions and sabotage, including US military personnel beating, abducting, threatening, and attempting to bribe NNSC inspection team members, as well as hindering the NNSC inspection teams from inspecting the replacement of war materials.

The Polish personnel and another group of Swiss personnel were originally scheduled to fly together from Gunsan to Busan at 9:30 a.m. on the 19th, but the US side delayed them until 2:00 p.m. The US side designated its liaison officer to take the first plane with the Swiss personnel, which took off five minutes before the second plane carrying the Polish personnel, including Colonel Sliwiński. Before the second plane took off, the engine was malfunctioning and running abnormally, and it took several attempts to start it before it barely took off. According to the pilot's report after the accident, he had reported the condition of the aircraft to the Gunsan Air Force Base Command before takeoff, but was still ordered to take off. Shortly after takeoff, the engine stopped working. The pilot tried to force a landing on the highway without success. The plane crashed into a rice field 150 meters from the highway, 20 kilometers away from Gunsan, with the engine buried in the soil. As a result, the four Polish personnel suffered concussion or nervous disorders. However, after they were injured, they remained at the scene of the accident for a long time without receiving any first aid or service. The US Air Force also did not search for the aircraft that failed to reach its destination. The US liaison officer and military police did not arrive at the scene until two hours later and sent the injured Polish personnel back to Gunsan. After returning to Gunsan, the Polish personnel received first aid from the Czechoslovak medical personnel of the Gunsan NNSC inspection team. Colonel Sliwiński lodged a protest with the local US military authorities on the 20th regarding this incident and requested an investigation. Colonel Sliwiński has also reported this incident to the NNSC.

### 美方对中立国监察委员会人员的安全采取不负责任的态度  波兰斯利文斯基上校等人因飞机失事受伤

    美方对中立国监察委员会人员的安全采取不负责任的态度
    波兰斯利文斯基上校等人因飞机失事受伤
    【新华社开城二十三日电】中立国监察委员会派往南朝鲜视察中立国视察小组工作的波兰人员，在十九日从群山乘飞机去釜山途中，由于美方对中立国监察委员会人员的安全采取不负责任的态度，以致发生一架飞机失事撞毁，使波兰人员四人负伤的事件。值得注意的是，这一事件是在美方军事人员殴打、劫持、威胁及企图贿买中立国视察小组人员，以及阻碍中立国视察小组对作战物资的替换进行视察的种种阻挠和破坏事件以后发生的。
    波兰人员和另一批瑞士人员原定在十九日上午九时三十分一同乘飞机由群山赴釜山，但被美方拖延到下午二时才乘到飞机。美方指定其联络官与瑞士人员乘第一架飞机起飞，波兰人员斯利文斯基上校等四人乘第二架飞机在五分钟后起飞。第二架飞机在起飞以前引擎就因故障运转不正常，发动多次才勉强起飞。据驾驶员在肇事后报告，他在起飞以前曾经将飞机的情况报告群山空军基地司令部，但仍奉令必须起飞。飞机起飞以后不久引擎就停止转动，驾驶员试图强迫降落在公路上没有成功，飞机在离群山二十公里的公路旁一百五十公尺的稻田中撞毁，引擎埋入土中。波兰人员四人因而发生震荡症或神经混乱症。但是，他们受伤以后逗留在出事地点很久始终未能获得任何急救和服务。美空军方面亦未对这架未能到达目的地的飞机进行搜寻。美方联络官及宪兵在两小时以后才到达出事地点，把受伤的波兰人员送回群山。波兰人员回到群山以后才由群山中立国视察小组的捷克斯洛伐克医务人员施行急救。斯利文斯基上校在二十日已就这一事件向当地美军当局提出抗议，并要求进行调查。斯利文斯基上校并已将此事件报告中立国监察委员会。
