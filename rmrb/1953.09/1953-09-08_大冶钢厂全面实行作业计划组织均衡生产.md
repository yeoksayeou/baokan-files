Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, September 5th: In order to improve enterprise management and ensure the comprehensive fulfillment of the 1953 national plan, the Daye Steel Plant of the state-owned Central China Iron and Steel Company is fully implementing operational planning to organize balanced production. In late June, based on mobilizing the workers to discuss the plan, the Daye Steel Plant first implemented weekly operational plans in workshops producing special steel. They also used advanced Soviet experience to improve the technical level of steelmaking workers and technicians in smelting high-quality steel and solved problems such as the heating capacity of the heating furnace in the forging workshop being smaller than the capacity of the forging hammer, gradually changing the imbalance in production. For example, in the first week of implementing the weekly operational plan, steelmaking only completed 88.5% of the weekly operational plan, and forging only completed 68.4%; while in the sixth and seventh weeks, steelmaking exceeded the plan by 13 to 14 percent, and forging also exceeded the weekly operational plan by more than 12 percent. This set an example for the plant to fully implement operational planning. Now, the plant has begun to implement comprehensive planning management centered on promoting operational planning. In September, workshops such as ironmaking, electric furnace, forging, steel rolling, and heat treatment began to implement day and night operational plans, and open hearth furnaces and other workshops also began to implement weekly operational plans. By October, all major workshops are preparing to implement shift operational plans and produce according to instruction charts.

In order to ensure that the operational plan is carried out well, the Daye Steel Plant carried out many preparatory tasks in August. First, the deputy director of the plant was sent to Anshan Steel to study experience in operational planning and dispatching work. Then, based on the experience of Anshan Steel and combined with the actual situation of the plant, a plan for implementing operational planning and establishing dispatching work was drafted. In mid-August, cadres from the Party organizations, administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations of the entire plant were organized for two weeks of study to enable them to grasp the spirit of operational planning. At the same time, the dispatching organizations of the entire plant and workshops were initially established and improved, and planners, statisticians, and material clerks were trained. In order to ensure the implementation of the operational plan, the plant also proposed specific measures such as adjusting workshop organizations, strengthening leadership over the operational plan, establishing a preliminary administrative responsibility system and machine maintenance and repair responsibility system, and rectifying original records. In order to enable the workers to implement the operational plan with a conscious work attitude, the Party organizations, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations of the Daye Steel Plant have respectively formulated work plans to strengthen political and ideological leadership. The plant also convened a plant-wide employee representative meeting from August 27th to 29th, and the representatives passed the operational plan on to the workers.

The leaders of the Daye Steel Plant realized that the quality of implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts is an important key to whether the operational plan can be completed. Therefore, they specifically formulated a technical organizational measures plan for implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts.

    大冶钢厂全面实行作业计划组织均衡生产
    【新华社武汉五日电】国营华中钢铁公司大冶钢厂为了改进企业管理，保证全面完成一九五三年的国家计划，正在全面实行作业计划，组织均衡生产。六月下旬，大冶钢厂在发动职工群众讨论计划的基础上，首先在生产特殊钢的各车间实行了周作业计划。并运用苏联先进经验提高了炼钢工人和技术人员冶炼优质钢的技术水平，解决了锻造车间加热炉加热能力小于锻锤能力等问题，逐步改变了生产上的不均衡现象。例如在实行周作业计划的第一周，炼钢只完成周作业计划的百分之八十八点五，锻造只完成百分之六十八点四；而第六周和第七周，炼钢就超过计划百分之十三到十四，锻造也超过周作业计划百分之十二强。这样就为全厂全面地实行作业计划树立了榜样。现在，该厂已开始实行以推行作业计划为中心的全面计划管理。九月份，炼铁、电炉、锻造、轧钢、热处理等车间，就开始实行昼夜作业计划，平炉和其他车间也开始实行周作业计划。到十月份，各主要车间都准备实行轮班作业计划，按指示图表进行生产。
    为了使作业计划进行得好，大冶钢厂在八月份曾进行了许多准备工作。首先派出副厂长到鞍钢去学习了作业计划与调度工作方面的经验。然后根据鞍钢的经验，结合本厂情况，拟订出实行作业计划和建立调度工作的方案。八月中旬又组织全厂中共党的组织、行政、工会和青年团组织的干部，进行了两个星期的学习，使他们掌握作业计划的精神。同时，还初步建立和健全了全厂和车间的调度机构，训练了计划员、统计员和材料员。为了保证作业计划的贯彻，该厂还提出调整车间组织，加强对作业计划的领导，建立初步的行政责任制和机器维护检修责任制，整顿原始记录等具体措施。为了使职工群众都能以自觉的劳动态度来贯彻作业计划，大冶钢厂中共党的组织、工会和青年团的组织都分别制订了加强政治、思想领导的工作计划。该厂并在八月二十七日到二十九日召开了全厂职工代表大会，通过代表把作业计划贯彻到职工群众中去。
    大冶钢厂的领导方面认识到贯彻苏联专家建议的好坏，是能否完成作业计划的重要关键，因此他们专门制订了贯彻苏联专家建议的技术组织措施方案。
