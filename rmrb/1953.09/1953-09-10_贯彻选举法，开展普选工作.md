    Shenyang 301 Factory and 205 Construction Site
    Promote Production Through Universal Suffrage Work
    In their universal suffrage work, Shenyang 301 Factory and the 205 Construction Site of the Second Engineering Company of the Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau combined universal suffrage with production, both doing a good job in universal suffrage and making it a driving force for production.
    After the start of the universal suffrage work in the 301 Factory, the leadership seriously carried out this work, closely integrating universal suffrage with production and making it a driving force for production. In terms of organizational leadership, a universal suffrage working group was first established, headed by Deputy Factory Director Jiang Wanshou and Trade Union Chairman Zhang Wanrong as the leader and deputy leader, respectively. Three section chiefs were assigned to specifically manage the universal suffrage work. Under the leadership of the universal suffrage working group, extensive and in-depth publicity and education work was carried out. First, the secretary of the Party General Branch made a report to all factory employees on the election law; then, cadres and propagandists who had undergone study went deep into the workshops and offices to carry out publicity and education, making universal suffrage publicity a vivid and practical patriotic education. In the publicity, the combination of universal suffrage and production was particularly emphasized. Therefore, when Trade Union Chairman Zhang Wanrong called on employees to increase production to welcome universal suffrage before voter registration, all factory employees actively responded to this call. Many model groups and advanced workers put forward guarantees. For example, Jin Yuxiang, the leader of a model group, put forward guarantees on behalf of the entire group of workers to improve quality to more than 99.5 percent, achieve balanced production, strengthen labor discipline, and increase attendance rate. Each workshop also put forward different slogans according to its own situation, calling for solving key problems. For example, the Sixth Sewing Workshop proposed "Eliminate waste cotton to welcome great events"; the Fifth Workshop proposed "Strengthen workshop management and strictly abide by labor discipline." In this way, new production achievements continued to emerge throughout the factory. According to statistics, the factory's output increased by 1.6 percent, quality increased by 0.8 percent, and the attendance rate increased by 0.8 percent.
    The universal suffrage work at the 205 Construction Site of the Second Engineering Company of the Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau was also carried out around production. In late July, He Xia, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee, instructed the 205 Construction Site to complete the state's tasks on time or ahead of schedule, improve project quality, strengthen and implement the responsibility system, conduct a major quality inspection, and launch a campaign to increase production and practice economy. Therefore, the task was heavy, but after the universal suffrage work was carried out on the construction site, it not only did not affect the work task, but also promoted the work. For example, after the entire construction site thoroughly carried out publicity and education on universal suffrage, several groups created new work achievements due to the increased political enthusiasm of the workers. For example, the plastering group of Jia Yuanlin did not complete the quota in July (18.5 meters per day), but after studying and discussing the universal suffrage documents, the workers' enthusiasm increased, they found tricks and tapped potential, reaching 40 meters per day, more than double the quota. Xu Huanxin, a technician in the steel bar workshop, invented two tools, saving materials for the country and improving work efficiency. In addition, the work of the payroll section and the accounting section, which often made mistakes in issuing wages in the past, has also seen significant improvements. The cooks of the Fourth Canteen also voluntarily signed a work agreement after education.
    Chongqing Municipal Universal Suffrage Reception Office
    Answers Questions About Universal Suffrage for Visiting Masses
    The universal suffrage reception offices established by the Chongqing Municipal Election Committee and the election committees of various districts have received many people from the masses who came to inquire about universal suffrage issues since June, which encouraged people's enthusiasm for participating in universal suffrage.
    With the gradual deepening of the universal suffrage work, the reception offices have increasingly received workers, peasants, industrialists, businessmen, and people from all walks of life from all directions. As of now, there have been more than 120 letters and visits, most of which are inquiries about voter eligibility. These issues have been dealt with and answered promptly and carefully; some that cannot be answered promptly are forwarded to relevant departments for processing. In order to prevent anyone who should have the right to vote from losing it, the reception office also sends people to visit their location, sometimes even dozens of miles away, to understand the situation. The First District Universal Suffrage Reception Office received a letter from Qiu Zhen, an old lady in her fifties, complaining that she was forced to sell her land nine years before liberation and had been working as a helper ever since, so she should have the right to vote, but she could not find proof at her current residence. The reception office sent people to Tuqiao Township in the suburbs, where she originally lived, to find out the situation. They obtained certification materials from the farmers' association and immediately issued her a voter certificate. She was very grateful for the government's concern for the people's right to vote and actively participated in the universal suffrage work.
    In the reception, they try to provide more convenience to many people who are not very literate or illiterate. Some people affectionately call the reception office a place to gather people's opinions, and many women come to inquire without any restraint. Women accounted for 66 percent of the visitors to the First District Universal Suffrage Reception Office. Some residents who live dozens of miles away also come to inquire. Tenant farmer Jiang Guangcheng ran more than 20 miles from Tuwan to the municipal reception office to ask if elderly people have the right to vote (because universal suffrage has not yet been launched in that area). When he learned that elderly people have equal voting rights, he excitedly said: I must go back and promote universal suffrage well. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 贯彻选举法，开展普选工作

    沈阳三○一工厂和二○五工地
    通过普选工作推动生产
    沈阳市三○一工厂和市建筑工程局第二工程公司二○五工地在普选工作中，使普选和生产结合，既把普选工作做好了，又使普选成为推动生产的动力。
    三○一工厂普选工作开始后，领导方面就认真地进行这一工作，使普选和生产密切结合，成为推动生产的动力。在组织领导上，首先成立了以副厂长姜万寿、工会主席张万荣为正副组长的普选工作组，并指派了三名科长具体掌握普选工作。在普选工作组领导下，展开了广泛、深入的宣传教育工作。首先由党总支书记向全厂职工做了关于选举法的报告；然后由经过学习的干部和宣传员等深入各车间、科室进行宣传教育，使普选宣传成为一次生动、实际的爱国主义教育。在宣传中特别强调了普选和生产结合。因此当工会主席张万荣在选民登记前号召职工们提高生产，迎接普选时，全厂职工便积极地响应了这一号召。许多模范小组和先进工作者都提出了保证。如模范小组组长金玉相代表全组工人提出把质量提高到百分之九十九点五以上、做到均衡生产、加强劳动纪律提高出勤率等保证。各个车间也根据本车间情况提出不同口号，号召解决关键问题。如缝纫六车间提出“消灭落地棉，迎接大喜事”；第五车间提出“加强车间管理，严格遵守劳动纪律”。就这样，全厂不断地出现创造新的生产成绩的事情。据统计，全厂产量提高百分之一点六，质量提高了百分之零点八，出勤率提高了百分之零点八。
    市建筑工程局第二工程公司二○五工地普选工作也是围绕着生产进行的。七月下旬，中共沈阳市委副书记何侠同志曾指示二○五工地要按期或提前完成国家任务，提高工程质量，加强和贯彻责任制，进行质量大检查，开展增产节约运动。因此任务较重，但普选工作在工地开展后，不但没有影响工作任务，而且推动了工作。如当全工地深入展开普选的宣传教育工作后，有几个小组由于工人政治热情的提高，创造了新的工作成绩。如贾元林抹灰小组全组七月份没有完成定额（每日十八公尺五），但学习、讨论普选文件后，工人热情提高，找窍门、挖掘潜力，每天达到四十公尺，超过定额一倍多。钢筋车间施工员徐焕馨发明了两种工具，给国家节省了材料，提高了工作效率。又如过去发放工资时常出错误的工资科、会计科，工作也有了显著的改进。第四食堂炊事员经过教育，也自动订了工作公约。
    重庆市普选接待室
    为来访群众解答有关普选问题
    重庆市选举委员会和各区选举委员会所设立的普选接待室，从六月份以后，接待了很多为征询有关普选问题而来访的人民群众，鼓舞了人们参加普选的积极性。
    随着普选工作逐渐深入的开展，接待室日益众多地接待着来自各方的工人、农民、工商业者以及各阶层人民。截至目前止，来信、来访的已有一百二十多件，其中绝大部分都是属于询问选民资格问题的。这些问题大都得到了及时处理和认真解答；有些不能及时解答的，就负责转送有关部门处理。为了不使一个应该得到选举权利的人失掉选举权，接待室还派人到他们所在的地方去访问，有时甚至跑到几十里路外去了解情况。第一区普选接待室接到五十多岁的老太婆邱珍来信，申诉她解放前九年被迫卖了土地，就一直当帮工，因而应该有选举权利，但是在她现住处找不到证明。接待室便派人到她原来居住的郊区土桥乡去了解，从农民协会里得到了证实材料，立即发给她选民证。她很感谢人民政府对人民选举权利的关怀，便积极参加普选工作。
    接待室在接待中对许多识字不多或不识字的人，尽量给以更多的方便。有的人把接待室亲切地说成是广纳人民意见的地方，很多妇女毫无拘束地前来询问。第一区普选接待室来访的人中，妇女就占了百分之六十六。有些远在几十里以外的居民也来询问。佃农蒋光澄从土湾跑了二十多里到市接待室来问老年人有没有选举权（因该地尚未展开普选），他知道老年人有同等选举权利时，兴奋地表示：回去一定要好好宣传普选。    （新华社）
