    The North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee Issues Instructions
    Mobilize the Entire Region to Support the Disaster-stricken People's Struggle for Production and Self-Relief
    [By Our Own Correspondent] The North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee issued instructions on the 16th regarding the urgent mobilization to carry out production for disaster relief and actively support the disaster areas.
    The instructions stated: The agricultural bumper harvest that was already in sight in North China has suffered from waterlogging in a considerable area, coupled with drought and other disasters in some areas, which has brought new difficulties to our work. Of course, these difficulties are difficulties in our progress. It is believed that the long-tested people of North China, under the strong leadership of the Party, have the conditions and confidence to overcome these difficulties. The instructions called on the entire Party and the people of the entire region to mobilize urgently, actively support the disaster areas, overcome the disasters, use all means to compensate for the losses caused by the disasters, and create all necessary conditions for next year's expanded reproduction of agriculture, especially increased grain production.
    The instructions stipulated: All levels of leadership organs in the disaster areas must regard production and disaster relief as the overriding central task at present and for a considerable period to come. Any work that affects or hinders this central task of production and disaster relief should be resolutely changed, postponed, or reduced in scope, or even have its original plan cancelled. The relevant county Party committees are responsible for making unified arrangements for various tasks, especially unified mobilization of various manpower and materials, to serve production and disaster relief, in accordance with the Party's policies and local disaster situation, and must not commit errors of egalitarianism or decentralism.
    In the disaster areas, in addition to continuing to vigorously solve the transportation and supply of daily necessities such as grain, coal, salt, and matches, to stabilize the lives of the masses and social order, efforts should be concentrated on doing a good job in drainage work and other preparatory work to ensure timely wheat planting. The difficulty of wheat seeds should be resolved as soon as possible through mutual assistance and adjustment among the masses and government loans, striving for about 60 million mu of wheat sowing in the entire region. This is an important task to shorten the disaster period and increase production, and it must be grasped and done well. At the same time, the masses should be mobilized to collect and protect the remaining autumn crops, rescue crops, and not lose a single plant or grain, do a good job in autumn planting and autumn plowing, and start preventing disasters such as wind and frost. The work of tax reduction and exemption, grain loans, and necessary relief must be done well. Widespread free lending among the masses should be carried out, and the Party's political leadership should be strengthened to fight against economic methods and various commercial speculation and high-interest exploitation. The relevant economic organs should formulate plans for organizing disaster victims to develop sideline production, according to the instructions of the provincial Party committees, and implement them quickly. The North China Bureau has instructed the North China Materials Exchange Conference being held in Tianjin to vigorously assist the disaster areas in solving the problem of sideline production outlets.
    Leadership organs at all levels should send capable cadres leading necessary staff to the disaster areas and disaster-stricken households in batches, to earnestly check the disaster situation, solve problems in a timely manner, and oppose simply sitting in offices and asking for materials, which would lead to missing opportunities. Problems raised by the masses and cadres must be answered as soon as possible. Things that can be done today should not be delayed until tomorrow. Delaying disaster relief work is a mistake.
    The instructions particularly emphasized that the people in the disaster areas must be educated to overcome difficulties and strive for production and self-relief through their own efforts. First of all, Party members and cadres in the disaster areas must be educated to implement the production and self-relief policies in an exemplary manner, share weal and woe with the people, lead the people to fight against disasters, and oppose abandoning leadership, local selfishness, taking the lead in outflowing, unwillingness to go deep into the disaster areas, and all other behaviors that are detached from the masses. In order to fully promote the positive factors among cadres and the masses, the leadership should pay great attention to praising good people and good deeds that have emerged on the production and disaster relief front that are worthy of emulation and encouragement (there are already many such good people and good deeds); at the same time, necessary criticism and punishment should be given to individual bureaucrats, deserters in the face of disaster, and serious localists.
    In order to effectively support the disaster areas and overcome difficulties, the instructions finally pointed out: All parts of North China, whether disaster areas or non-disaster areas, should educate cadres and the masses in accordance with the spirit of increasing production, increasing income, practicing strict economy, and tightening expenditures, vigorously increase production and practice economy, pay special attention to saving grain, eat more coarse grains and less fine grains, and support the country and the disaster areas with surplus grain. Organs, organizations, and troops should become models of saving grain, and put forward specific measures and requirements for saving grain. All localities should do everything possible to support sideline production in the disaster areas and help sideline production in the disaster areas find outlets.

    中共中央华北局发出指示
    动员全区支援灾区人民生产自救的斗争
    【本报讯】中共中央华北局十六日发出关于紧张动员起来进行生产救灾和积极支援灾区的指示。
    指示中说：华北区业已在望的农业丰收，已在相当大的一片土地上遭受了涝灾，加以部分地区的旱灾及其它灾害，给我们的工作带来了新的困难，当然这种困难是在我们前进中的困难，相信久经考验的华北人民在党的坚强领导下，是有条件有信心来克服这些困难的。指示号召全党、全区人民紧张动员起来，积极支援灾区，战胜灾害，用一切办法补偿因灾害所遭受的损失，并为明年的农业扩大再生产特别是增产粮食，创造一切必需的条件。
    指示中规定：所有灾区的各级领导机关，必须把生产救灾工作作为当前以及在今后一个相当长的时期内压倒一切的中心任务，凡是影响和障碍生产救灾这一中心任务的任何工作，都应坚决改变、推迟或缩小直至取消原来计划。责成有关各县委根据党的政策及当地灾情，统一安排各项工作，特别是统一调动各种人力、物力，使之服务于生产救灾，不得犯平均主义、分散主义的错误。
    在灾区，目前除继续大力解决粮食、煤炭、食盐、火柴等日用品的运输、供应问题，以安定群众生活和社会秩序外，应集中力量做好排水工作以及其他准备工作，保证适时种麦。麦种的困难应通过群众的互助调剂及政府的贷款尽速解决，争取全区播麦六千万亩左右。这是缩短灾期和增加生产的一项重要工作，务必抓紧做好。同时，应动员群众收拾与保护残秋，抢救庄稼，不再损失一棵一粒，做好秋种秋耕工作，并着手预防风霜等灾害。确实把税收减免和贷粮贷款及必要的救济工作做好。广泛开展群众间的自由借贷，加强党的政治领导，以经济办法和各种商业投机及高利盘剥行为作斗争。各有关经济机关，应根据省委的指示，制订关于组织灾民开展副业生产的计划，迅速施行。华北局已责成正在天津召开的华北物资交流会议大力协助灾区解决副业出路问题。
    各级领导机关应分期分批地派得力干部率领必要的工作人员深入灾区、灾户，切实检查灾情，及时解决问题，反对单纯坐机关、要材料，以致坐失时机。凡群众和干部提出的问题，须尽快答复，今天能办的事不拖到明天，拖延救灾工作便是错误。
    指示特别强调必须教育灾区人民以自己的力量战胜困难，努力生产自救。首先要教育灾区的党员和干部，模范地执行生产自救政策，与人民同甘苦共患难，领导人民与灾害作斗争，反对放弃领导、本位自私、带头外流、不愿深入灾区及其他一切脱离群众的行为。为了使干部和人民群众中的积极因素充分发扬起来，领导方面应十分注意表扬在生产救灾战线上涌现出来的足以令人仿效和鼓舞的好人好事（这种好人好事已经不少了）；同时对于个别官僚主义分子、临难脱逃分子以及严重的本位主义分子，应予以必要的批评和处罚。
    为了有效地支援灾区，战胜困难，指示最后指出：华北各地，不论灾区或非灾区，都应依照增加生产、增加收入、厉行节约、紧缩开支的精神，教育干部和群众，大力增产节约，特别注意节约粮食，多吃粗粮，少吃细粮，以余粮支援国家，支援灾区。机关、团体、部队应成为节约粮食的模范，提出节约粮食的具体措施和要求。各地应尽一切可能支援灾区副业生产，帮助灾区副业生产找寻出路。
