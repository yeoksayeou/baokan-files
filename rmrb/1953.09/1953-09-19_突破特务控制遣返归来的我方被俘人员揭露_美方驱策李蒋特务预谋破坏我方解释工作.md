Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 17th: Gui Rangpin, a captured Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldier who broke through the control of Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents and requested repatriation, denounced to reporters after being repatriated by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on the 16th: "In order to prevent our captured personnel from daring to request repatriation, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents forced all non-repatriated Chinese People's Volunteer Army captured personnel to tattoo the flags and slogans of the Chiang Kai-shek gang on their bodies in August. Those who were unwilling to be tattooed were killed." Gui Rangpin took off his shirt to show reporters the characters that he was forced to have tattooed on his body. A Chiang Kai-shek party flag was tattooed on his chest, and a map of China with a Chiang Kai-shek national flag inserted in it was tattooed on his back. Slogans of the Chiang Kai-shek gang were tattooed on both arms. He said: "In the past, Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents forced us to tattoo characters on our arms. Later, many prisoners of war used knives to dig out the tattooed characters. This time, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents said to us viciously: 'This time, we will tattoo you large and deep, to see if you can still dig them out!' The Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents used two-inch-long copper needles to pierce our flesh fiercely, causing our bodies to be covered in blood. After we were forced to be tattooed, American officers came to the camp to inspect the characters we had tattooed and took pictures of us."

Gui Rangpin said angrily: "The Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents also used terrorist methods to coerce the Chinese People's Volunteer Army captured personnel not to request repatriation. Many people were killed by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents because they expressed their determination to return to the motherland. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents even dug out their hearts and showed them to the other prisoners of war, threatening them by saying: 'Whoever dares to say they want to return to the mainland will be killed.' Some people had their ears cut off. More people were subjected to beatings and all kinds of torture." Tears could not help but stream down Gui Rangpin's face as he talked about the brutal torture suffered by our captured personnel.

Next, Gui Rangpin revealed the conspiracy of the U.S. military authorities to support and assist the Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents in preparing to sabotage the explanation work of the Korean-Chinese side. He said: "When we were about to leave Jeju Island and be transferred to the demilitarized zone, the U.S. military authorities transported many wooden sticks and iron materials and handed them over to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents to make flagpoles with iron tips, so that they could be brought into the prisoner-of-war camps guarded by the Indian army as weapons for sabotage activities. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents openly said: 'After taking them in, cut them into sections, which can be used as wooden sticks and bayonets to beat the communist explanation representatives.' The Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents also coerced us to beat, scold, and throw stones at the representatives and staff of the Korean-Chinese side together with them. Three Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents sent from Taiwan also forced us to attend classes and coerced us to refuse the explanation of the Korean-Chinese side."

Gui Rangpin said that the Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents also ordered our captured personnel not to call them "battalion commander" or "company commander" after being handed over to the Indian army, but to call them by their names, and threatened our captured personnel to still obey their orders in the prisoner-of-war camps guarded by the Indian army, otherwise they would be executed. This sinister conspiracy of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents was obviously to make it easier for them to impersonate prisoners of war and mix in the prisoner-of-war camps guarded by the Indian army to continue to carry out terrorist rule over the prisoners of war. Gui Rangpin said indignantly: "The three Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents sent from Taiwan who forced us to attend classes came to the demilitarized zone with us by boat and train, and entered the prisoner-of-war camps with us, impersonating prisoners of war."

Gui Rangpin said that those Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents who had infiltrated into the prisoner-of-war camps stood guard day and night, monitoring the actions of our captured personnel and preventing them from requesting repatriation. They also forbade our captured personnel from talking to the representatives of the Korean-Chinese side and the Indian soldiers. Gui Rangpin said: "On September 13th, when we entered the prisoner-of-war camps guarded by the Indian army, a prisoner of war saw the observation representative of the Korean-Chinese side and said a word to himself. In the evening, during an illegal roll call, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents threatened everyone by saying: 'If this person is found, he will be executed.'"

Gui Rangpin described how he broke through the control of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents and requested repatriation: "On the morning of September 14th, it was drizzling. While the Chiang Kai-shek bandits were sleeping soundly, I secretly escaped. After climbing over the barbed wire, I saw the Indian guards and told them that I wanted to return to my motherland. However, the Indian guards could not understand my words. At this moment, a Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agent who could speak English rushed over. While dragging me back, he spoke to the Indian guards in English. I heard him say the words 'Taiwan' several times. I immediately realized that he was deceiving the Indian guards, saying that I was going to Taiwan. In my anxiety, I picked up a stone from the ground to hit this special agent. The Indian guards immediately understood what I meant, drove away the special agent, and separated me from him."

Gui Rangpin finally said: "I know that our captured personnel who are still in the prisoner-of-war camps want to return to the motherland like me all the time. However, due to the control and persecution of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents, they cannot freely express their will to request repatriation."

    突破特务控制遣返归来的我方被俘人员揭露
    美方驱策李蒋特务预谋破坏我方解释工作
    【新华社开城十七日电】突破蒋匪特务控制要求遣返回国的中国人民志愿军被俘人员贵让品，十六日由中立国遣返委员会遣返归来以后对记者们控诉说：“蒋匪特务为了使我方被俘人员不敢要求遣返，在八月间强迫所有没有遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员在身上刺上蒋匪帮的旗帜和口号。不愿刺字的人就被杀害。”贵让品脱去上衣给记者们看他身上被强迫刺的字。他胸上被刺上一面蒋匪党旗，背上刺了一幅插着一面蒋匪国旗的中国地图。两臂上都刺了蒋匪帮口号。他说：“过去蒋匪特务强迫我们在臂上刺字。后来许多战俘用刀把刺的字都挖掉了。这一次，蒋匪特务狠毒地对我们说：‘这一回，要给你们刺得大，刺得深，看你们还能挖得掉！’蒋匪特务用二寸长的铜针狠命地刺进我们的肉里去，刺得我们身上流满了血。我们被强迫刺字以后，美国军官就到营场里来检查我们所刺的字，还给我们拍照。”
    贵让品愤怒地说：“蒋匪特务还用恐怖手段胁迫中国人民志愿军被俘人员不得要求遣返。许多人因为表示决心返回祖国，被蒋匪特务杀死。蒋匪特务还把他们的心挖出来给其他的战俘看，恫吓他们说：‘谁再敢说回大陆去，就杀死谁。’有些人被割掉了耳朵。更多的人遭到毒打和各色各样的酷刑。”贵让品谈到我方被俘人员惨遭酷刑的情形时眼泪就不禁滚下来了。
    接着，贵让品揭露了美军当局支持和协助蒋匪特务准备破坏朝中方面的解释工作的阴谋，他说：“在我们快要离开济州岛移送到非军事区来的时候，美军当局运来许多木棍和铁料，交给蒋匪特务制成有铁尖头的旗杆，以便带进印度军队看管的战俘营去，作为进行破坏活动的武器。蒋匪特务公开说：‘带进去以后把它截成几段，可以当作木棒和枪刺来打共产党的解释代表。’蒋匪特务还胁迫我们跟着他们一起打朝中方面的代表和工作人员，辱骂他们，和对他们掷石块。三个台湾派来的蒋匪特务还强迫给我们上课，胁迫我们拒绝朝中方面的解释。”
    贵让品说，蒋匪特务还命令我方被俘人员在移交给印度军队看管以后，不准再叫他们“大队长”、“中队长”，改称他们的名字，并且恫吓我方被俘人员在印度军队看管的战俘营内仍旧要服从他们的命令，否则便要处死。蒋匪特务的这个罪恶阴谋，显然是为了便于他们冒充战俘混在印度军队看管的战俘营内，继续对战俘施行恐怖统治。贵让品愤慨地说：“那三个强迫给我们上课的台湾派来的蒋匪特务与我们一起坐船坐火车来到非军事区，并且冒充战俘与我们一起进入了战俘营。”
    贵让品说，那些混进战俘营的蒋匪特务日夜站岗放哨，监视我方被俘人员的行动，不许他们要求遣返。他们还禁止我方被俘人员与朝中方面代表和印度士兵说话。贵让品说：“九月十三日，当我们进入印度军队看管的战俘营时，有一个战俘看到朝中方面的观察代表自言自语地说了一句话。晚上，蒋匪特务在非法点名时，就威胁大家说：‘如果查到这个人，就要把他处死。’”
    贵让品叙述他突破蒋匪特务的控制要求遣返回国的情形说：“九月十四日早晨，下着细雨，我乘着蒋匪熟睡未醒，就偷偷地逃了出来。我爬过铁丝网以后，看见了印度卫兵，我告诉他说，我要回到祖国去。但是，印度卫兵听不懂我的话。正在这时，一个会说英语的蒋匪特务赶了过来，他一面拖我回去，一面用英语对印度卫兵哇呀哇呀说话。我听到他说了好几次‘台湾’这两个字。我立刻明白他是在欺骗印度卫兵，说我是要到台湾去。我急得在地上拾起一块石头要打这个特务。印度卫兵立刻明白了我的意思，就赶走了这个特务，把我隔离开来。”
    贵让品最后说：“我知道，现在仍在战俘营里的我方被俘人员像我一样时时刻刻想回到祖国来。但是由于蒋匪特务的控制和迫害，他们无法自由表达他们要求遣返的意志。”
