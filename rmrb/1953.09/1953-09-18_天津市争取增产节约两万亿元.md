    Tianjin Strives to Increase Production and Practice Economy by Two Trillion Yuan
    [Our Newspaper's News] The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of Party member cadres on the 16th. Wu De, Deputy Secretary of the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered a mobilization report at the meeting, calling on all Party members to unite with people from all walks of life in the city to strive to increase production and practice economy for the country by two trillion yuan this year.
    In his report, Wu De explained the significance of increasing production and practicing economy, and also analyzed in detail the situation of Tianjin's industrial production, capital construction, state-owned commerce, and tax revenue work in the first half of the year. He particularly pointed out the conditions that Tianjin possesses for striving to over fulfill the state plan: the political consciousness of the broad masses of workers has been greatly improved; there is still huge potential within enterprises; the peak season for trade has arrived, and the market is increasingly prosperous; under the education and cultivation of the Party, cadres at all levels have greatly improved their ideological and professional levels through practical work training.
    Wu De emphasized: All departments must take the work of increasing production and practicing economy as the central task that overrides everything else at present. All state-owned, local state-owned, and joint state-private factories and enterprises should determine the goals of increasing production and practicing economy according to the specific circumstances of their enterprises. All products with guaranteed sales and raw materials should increase production; for products with current difficulties in sales or raw materials, efforts should be made to complete the original plan, focusing on improving quality and reducing costs to open up sales. The capital construction department should complete the project progress plan ahead of schedule on the basis of effectively ensuring project quality, implement the policy of "good, fast, economical, and safe," and oppose various wasteful phenomena. Workers in all private factories should also set competition goals according to the production and sales conditions of each factory. Party organizations and trade unions in private factories should educate workers to recognize the significance of increasing production and practicing economy in private factories, mobilize them to actively participate in the competition, and urge the capitalists to improve business management and working conditions, while also supervising and preventing the capitalists from engaging in the "five poisons" again. All state-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives should vigorously organize the exchange of materials, systematically control the sources of goods, organize procurement, and expand sales. At the same time, they should cooperate with transportation and other departments to solve the existing transportation and warehouse problems, so as to accelerate capital turnover and reduce circulation costs. All tax revenue departments should concentrate their efforts on doing a good job in peak season collection, ensuring the completion of the tax revenue plan, and expanding tax sources and increasing tax revenue on the basis of developing production, expanding exchanges, and eliminating tax evasion.
    Finally, Wu De pointed out: In the work of increasing production and increasing income, we must oppose the tendency of blindly pursuing profits or completing figures and violating the Party's policies, and when practicing strict economy and tightening expenditures, we must oppose the tendency of failing to do what should be done and failing to use what should be used. He requested that all financial and economic departments strengthen political work in carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, conduct universal and in-depth publicity and education for the workers, so that all workers fully understand the significance of increasing production and practicing economy for the industrialization of the motherland, give full play to their high degree of enthusiasm and creativity, and victoriously complete and over fulfill the plan to increase production and practice economy by two trillion yuan.

    天津市争取增产节约两万亿元
    【本报讯】中共天津市委员会在十六日召开党员干部大会。中共天津市委副书记吴德在会上作动员报告，号召全体党员团结全市各界人民，争取今年为国家增产节约两万亿元。
    吴德在报告中说明了增产节约的意义，又详细地分析了天津市上半年工业生产、基本建设、国营商业和税收等工作的情况。他特别指出了天津市在争取超额完成国家计划方面所具备的条件：广大职工的政治觉悟大大提高了；企业内部仍然存在着巨大的潜力；贸易旺季已经到来，市场日益繁荣；在党的教育培养下，各级干部经过实际工作锻炼，思想水平与业务水平都有很大的提高。
    吴德强调指出：各部门必须把增产节约工作作为当前压倒一切的中心任务。各国营、地方国营和公私合营的工厂企业，应根据本企业的具体情况，确定增产节约的目标。凡销路和原料有保证的产品都要进行增产；销路或原料在目前有困难的产品，要努力完成原订计划，集中力量提高质量、降低成本，以打开销路。基本建设部门应在切实保证工程质量的基础上，提前完成工程进度计划，贯彻“好、快、省、安全”的方针，反对各种浪费现象。各私营工厂的职工也应根据各厂产销情况订出竞赛的目标。私营各厂的党组织和工会应教育职工认清在私营工厂中增产节约的意义，动员他们积极地投入竞赛，并督促资方改善经营管理与劳动条件，同时要监督并防止资方再施“五毒”。各国营商业部门和供销合作社应大力组织物资交流，有计划地掌握货源、组织收购、扩大推销。同时要配合交通运输等部门解决目前存在的运输问题与仓库问题，以加速资金周转、减低流转费用。各税收部门应集中力量做好旺季征收工作，保证完成税收计划，并在发展生产、扩大交流、杜绝偷税漏税的基础上，扩大税源，增加税收。
    最后，吴德指出：在增加生产、增加收入的工作中，必须反对片面追求利润或完成数字而违反党的政策的偏向，在厉行节约、紧缩开支时必须反对应办不办、该用不用的偏向。他要求各财政经济部门在开展增产节约竞赛中，加强政治工作，向职工进行普遍而深入的宣传教育，使全体职工充分认识增产节约对祖国工业化的意义，发挥高度的积极性和创造性，胜利地完成并超额完成增产节约二万亿元的计划。
