Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 7th: The construction and machinery installation of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Seamless Steel Tube Plant is nearing completion, and a comprehensive trial production will begin in mid-September. Currently, the construction workers are speeding up the completion of the final phase of the project. Acceptance team members, armed with various design technical documents and inspection tools, have already begun the project completion acceptance work. The repair workshop has been basically accepted and is being handed over to the production departments for use. The entire project is expected to be basically accepted by October.

The main projects of this giant factory were basically completed by the end of June. In July and August, various main mechanical and electrical equipment underwent partial trial runs and adjustments. Electrical equipment has already begun supplying power to the plant. The factory buildings have been painted and whitewashed beautifully, and the floors are being cleaned and the skylight glass is being scrubbed. Some auxiliary equipment arrived relatively late, and workers are now speeding up the installation. Once this equipment is installed, it will be able to supply electricity, oil, air, water, gas, and steam to the entire plant, meeting the production needs of each workshop.

To complete the remaining project ahead of schedule and put the factory into production as soon as possible, the workers building the Seamless Steel Tube Plant have demonstrated a high degree of patriotism and revolutionary heroism in the labor competition. The walls of the workers' lounges are covered with many challenge letters, response letters, and colorful slogans expressing various resolutions to complete the project ahead of schedule. The workers installing a certain gas pipeline joint worked in shifts around the clock. The state required this project to be completed in five days. The metal structure company that contracted the project planned to complete it in forty-eight hours, but the workers guaranteed to complete it in an even shorter time. When pipeline workers were connecting the main water lines, they found a thick layer of mud accumulated at the construction site, but in order to save time cleaning the mud, they lay in the mud to work. To avoid interrupting the work, they took turns eating. As a result, this project, which normally required two days to complete, was completed in just one day.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 7th: The state-owned Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant, Shenyang Fan Factory, Electric Engineering No. 14 Factory, and five other factories completed a batch of urgent orders for Anshan Iron and Steel Company in August. This batch of orders included more than thirty types of products such as large gas gate valves, lathes, shears, radial drilling machines, water pumps, air compressors, blowers, and switches, all of which were needed for the construction of Anshan Iron and Steel Company's large-scale rolling mill, seamless steel tube plant, and other projects. The quality and specifications of this batch of products all met Soviet standards. The workers in each factory overcame various difficulties in the production process, ensuring that the product quality and specifications met the requirements.

"Support Anshan Iron and Steel" has become the most glorious thing in the minds of the vast number of workers in Shenyang. The workers of the Shenyang Fan Factory had been looking forward to manufacturing equipment for Anshan Iron and Steel since the autumn of last year, waiting for nearly a year, and only received the order in July this year. After receiving the order task, they immediately established professional groups and technical research groups to study the trial production of new products. Dispatchers strengthened dispatching work to solve the difficulties of insufficient tools and fixtures. The director of Electric Engineering No. 14 Factory also personally placed orders with other units to solve the shortage of bakelite boards and other raw materials. Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant also encountered great difficulties in manufacturing the gate plate and gate shell of large gas gate valves. This type of product required a completely tight fit, with no air leakage allowed. At first, the workers of fitter team three failed several times. But they were not discouraged, they knew that the quality was related to the safety of Anshan Iron and Steel workers, so they continued to experiment, and finally succeeded on the afternoon of August 31st.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou: The Zhejiang Provincial Forestry Bureau has successfully completed this year's timber supply task for Anshan Iron and Steel Company. By the end of August, all 150,000 fir wood handover poles had been delivered. With the active assistance of the local Coal Construction Company and the Railway Administration, 130,000 fir logs have been transported to Anshan Iron and Steel Company, and the remaining 20,000 are being transferred.

In completing this batch of timber supply, the Zhejiang Provincial Forestry Bureau received strong support from the Party and government leading organs and farmers in nearly twenty counties including Kaihua and Qu County. The peasants learned that logging was to support the basic construction of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, and at the same time heard that if Anshan Iron and Steel was built well, it could produce a large number of tractors, so they all held high enthusiasm and ran into various high mountains and deep valleys to actively cut fir trees. Many farmers also helped to concentrate the finished materials and transport them through hundreds of miles of rivers and waterways to lumber yards near the railway lines, ensuring that large quantities of timber were loaded onto trains in time and transported to Anshan Iron and Steel.

    鞍钢无缝钢管厂将在本月试车
    沈阳重型机器厂等和浙江省森林工业局积极支援鞍钢
    【新华社鞍山七日电】国营鞍山钢铁公司无缝钢管厂的建筑工程和机器安装工程就要完工，九月中旬将进行全面试车。现在，建厂职工正在加速完成最后一部分工程。拿着各种设计技术资料和各种检验工具的验收小组人员，已经开始做工程竣工验收工作。修理车间已经基本上验收完毕，正在陆续移交给生产部门使用。全部工程预计要在十月份基本上验收完毕。
    这座巨型工厂的各项主要工程在六月底就基本上完工了。到七、八月份，各种主要机械设备和电气设备，都局部地进行了试运转和调整，电气设备已开始向厂内送电。厂房已经油漆和粉刷得漂漂亮亮的，现在正在清扫地面和擦洗天窗玻璃。有些附属设备来得比较晚，现在职工们正在加紧安装。这些设备安装好以后，就可以向全厂输送电、油、风、水、瓦斯和蒸汽，供应各车间生产需用。
    建设无缝钢管厂的职工，为了提前完成剩余的工程，使工厂早日完工投入生产，在劳动竞赛中发扬了高度爱国主义和革命英雄主义的精神。工人休息室的墙壁上，贴了许多挑战、应战书和表示各种决心提前完成工程任务的彩色标语。安装某项瓦斯管道接头的工人们，整日整夜地轮流工作。这项工程国家要求在五天内完成，承包这个工程的金属结构公司，计划在四十八小时完工，而工人们却保证在更短的时间内完成。管道工人在进行水道干线接头时，发现施工场所淤积着一层很深的稀泥，但他们为了节省清除稀泥的时间，就躺在稀泥里工作。为了不使工作间断，他们轮流着吃饭。结果，这个平时需要两天完成的工程，只用一天时间就完成了。
    【新华社沈阳七日电】国营沈阳重型机器厂、沈阳扇风机厂、电工十四厂等七个工厂，八月份完成了给鞍山钢铁公司做的一批紧要的订货。这批订货中，有大型瓦斯闸门、车床、剪床、摇臂钻床、水泵、空气压缩机、送风机和开关等三十多种产品，都是鞍山钢铁公司大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂等建设工程需要的。这批产品的质量、规格都是苏联的标准。各工厂职工在生产过程中战胜了各种困难，使产品质量、规格都达到了要求。
    “支援鞍钢”，已在沈阳市广大职工的心目中成了最光荣的事情。沈阳扇风机厂的职工们，从去年秋季起就盼着给鞍钢制造设备，盼了将近一年，到今年七月才盼到了。订货任务接到以后，他们立即成立了专业小组和技术研究组研究新产品的试制工作。调度员加强调度工作，解决工具、卡具不足的困难。电工十四厂的厂长还亲自到其他单位订货解决胶木板和其他原材料缺乏的困难。沈阳重型机器厂在制造大型瓦斯闸门的闸板和闸壳的时候，也遇到很大困难。这种产品要求完全严密合缝，不准透气。一开始，钳工三组的工人几次试验都没有成功。但他们并不灰心，他们知道质量好坏关系着鞍钢工人的安全，就继续试验，到八月三十一日下午终于得到成功。
    【新华社杭州讯】浙江省森林工业局胜利完成今年供应鞍山钢铁公司的木材任务。到八月底止，十五万根杉木交手杆已全部交货。在当地煤建公司和铁路管理局积极协助下，已有十三万根杉木运往鞍山钢铁公司，余下的两万根正在调运中。
    浙江省森林工业局在完成这批木材供应中，曾得到开化、衢县等近二十个县的党、政领导机关和农民的大力支持。农民们了解到采伐木材是支援鞍山钢铁公司基本建设的，同时听说鞍钢建设好了，可以生产出大批的拖拉机，因而都抱着很高的热情，跑进各个高山深谷，积极开伐杉木。不少农民并帮助把成材集中起来，通过数百里路的江河水道，放运到铁路线附近的贮木场，保证了大批木材及时地装上火车运往鞍钢。
