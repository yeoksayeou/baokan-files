    Movie Projection Teams, Don't Be Afraid to Enter Mountainous Areas
    A letter from the Yunxi County Cultural Center, Hubei Province: Our county is located in the remote mountainous area of northwestern Hubei. Transportation is very inconvenient. Vehicles cannot pass at all, and there is only a small river that can be used for boats. During the Kuomintang rule, the people of this remote county lived very bitterly, and naturally there was no cultural entertainment to speak of. Since liberation, the people's material lives have gradually improved, and their demand for cultural life has become increasingly urgent. Everyone hopes to see movies that they have never seen before. According to the demands of the masses, our county has repeatedly made suggestions to the Xiangyang Special District Film Projection Team, hoping that they would come to our county to show movies; however, they used the excuse of "inconvenient transportation, fearing damage to the machines" and have always refused to come.
    The projection area of the First Detachment of the Ankang Special District Film Projection Team in neighboring Shaanxi Province is also a mountainous area, but the film projection team in that area can overcome transportation difficulties and go deep into various places to show movies. Recently, taking advantage of their touring projection to Baihe County, which borders Yunxi, our county leaders sent a special person to contact them, asking them to come to Yunxi to show movies for a few days. After obtaining the consent of the local leading authorities, they came without complaint. The people of Yunxi County warmly welcomed them, and farmers who lived twenty or thirty li from the city rushed to see the movies.
    The First Detachment of the Ankang Special District Film Projection Team can go deep into the mountainous areas to show movies, mainly because they have the courage and determination to overcome difficulties. They said: "If the machines are too big, they can be dismantled and moved. If one person can't move them, two people can carry them. As long as there are people living there, we can go, and we can overcome any difficulties." However, the Xiangyang Special District Film Projection Team is not actively trying to overcome difficulties. It is hoped that the Xiangyang Special District Film Projection Team can learn from the First Detachment of the Ankang Special District Film Projection Team, strengthen the concept of serving the people, and go deep into the mountainous areas to show movies.

### 电影放映队不要怕进山区

专栏：读者来信摘要

    电影放映队不要怕进山区
    湖北省郧西县文化馆来信：我县处在湖北西北部大山地区，交通很不方便，车辆完全不能通行，只有一条小河可以通船。在国民党统治时期，这荒僻小县的人民的生活是非常苦的，自然没有什么文化娱乐可言。解放以后，群众物质生活日渐提高，对文化生活的要求也日益迫切，大家都希望能看到过去从未看过的电影。根据群众的要求，我县几次向襄阳专区电影放映队提出意见，希望他们来我县放映；但是他们却藉口“交通不便，怕损坏机器”，始终不肯来放映。
    邻省陕西省的安康专区电影放映队第一分队所属放映区域，同样也是大山地区，但该区电影放映队却能克服交通困难，深入各地放映。最近趁他们巡回放映到和郧西交界的白河县时，我县领导同志派专人前去接洽，请他们来郧西放映几天。在取得当地领导机关同意后，他们便不辞辛苦地来了。郧西县的人民热烈地欢迎他们，离城二、三十里路的农民都赶来看电影。
    安康专区电影放映队一分队能深入山区放映电影，主要是因为他们有克服困难的勇气和决心。他们说：“机器大了可以拆开搬，一个人搬不动两个人抬。只要有人住的地方我们都能去，再大的困难也能克服。”但襄阳专区电影放映队却不是积极想法克服困难的。希望襄阳专区电影放映队能向安康专区电影放映队第一分队学习，加强为人民服务的观念，深入山区放映电影。
