Xinhua News Agency, September 25th: According to TASS on September 24th: The United Nations General Assembly held plenary meetings on the morning and afternoon of September 23rd to continue the general debate.

    At the morning meeting, the first speaker was Canadian representative Pearson. He said that there is now an opportunity to ease international tensions to some extent, and he hoped that this session of the General Assembly would make full use of this opportunity. However, Pearson attributed the easing of international tensions to the existence of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc and praised this bloc greatly. He talked about the divisions within this bloc, but he tried to prove that these divisions were not very serious. Pearson briefly explained the Canadian government's attitude towards the Korean issue. He said that the Canadian government does not support any hostile acts within Korea that do not belong to the United Nations action, and opposes any attempt to interpret the United Nations' goals as including the use of force to unify Korea. Pearson also said that the Canadian government knows that the signing of the armistice agreement does not relieve Canada of its obligations in Korea as a member of the United Nations. Pearson used a considerable part of his speech to attack the democratic camp and largely repeated Dulles' remarks at the United Nations General Assembly on September 17th.
    Polish delegation leader Naszkowski then spoke. He pointed out that the Korean armistice aroused the hope of people of all countries for the smooth resolution of other international disputes. However, the United Nations has not yet taken advantage of the various possibilities arising from the armistice. Instead of deciding to convene a broadly based political conference to create conditions for resolving the Korean issue and other issues threatening peace in the Far East, it is attempting to force the governments of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to accept the form of a conference between opposing parties, preventing Asian countries that are very concerned about the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue from participating. This policy of the United States and its supporters strikes at the rights of Asian countries. Naszkowski pointed out that the replies of the Chinese and Korean governments to the Secretary-General of the United Nations are another contribution to the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. These two documents give the United Nations the opportunity to return to the only correct path, the path of holding a round table conference with neutral countries, especially Asian countries, participating. The United Nations should re-examine the issue of the Korean political conference.
    The Polish representative accused the United States of conducting sabotage activities against the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries. He also said that the unrestricted arms expansion movement of the United States and other North Atlantic group countries is still one of the particularly dangerous sources of international tension. He called on the General Assembly to adopt the Soviet proposal on "measures to eliminate the threat of another world war and ease international tensions."
    The Polish representative said that in order to accomplish the task of consolidating peace, the United Nations must eliminate the absurd situation in which the representatives of the great Chinese people are not participating in the United Nations. This situation not only violates the United Nations Charter, violates the indisputable rights of the Chinese people, but also increases the difficulty of resolving major issues in world politics. In world politics, the Chinese people are a factor of extreme importance.
    The Cuban representative's speech greatly flattered the American foreign policy.
    At the afternoon meeting, Guatemalan representative Toriello Garrido spoke first. He said that the Guatemalan delegation advocates that "the natural rights of all countries that are reasonably concerned with Asian coordination should be respected." The vast majority of the Guatemalan representative's speech was an exposure of the policies of American monopoly capital and ruling groups towards Guatemala. He said that Guatemala implemented land reform and promulgated a number of decrees that could promote national economic development and safeguard national independence. This has violated the "interests of foreign monopoly capital." American monopoly capital, especially the United Fruit Company, is, with the support of the American ruling group, trying to overthrow the current government of Guatemala and undermine its achievements. He went on to say that in the United Nations, there are enough words saying that foreign investment is a panacea for saving backward countries. However, foreign companies' investment in backward countries is precisely the main reason for the economic backwardness of these countries. Taking Guatemala as an example, foreign monopoly capital controls its port facilities, major transportation and communication equipment, and electricity production, tightly grasping the lifeline of economic development. The Guatemalan representative said that he hopes that the expansion of investment in backward countries advocated by the United Nations will not take the investment of the American United Fruit Company in Guatemala as an "example." He also said that the colonial era has ended and the colonial system must disappear from the earth. The Guatemalan representative's speech won prolonged applause from many representatives and guests.
    The representatives of the Union of South Africa and Ecuador spoke in support of the United States. The Abyssinian representative called for a speedy resolution of the issue of racial discrimination, and requested the United Nations to provide more economic assistance to backward countries and assist the people of colonial territories to gain independence.
    The last speaker was Ukrainian representative Baranovksy. He said: The Korean armistice is a serious failure of the "policy of strength" and a victory for the policy of advocating peaceful resolution of international disputes. However, there are still many serious obstacles on the road to normalizing international relations. He said: Dulles' speech showed no indication that the United States intends to pay attention to the universal efforts of people of all countries, intends to stop the "Cold War" and the arms race. On the contrary, his speech was full of demands for unilateral concessions from the Soviet Union. The Ukrainian representative said that the Indian representative was right, the United States is attempting to turn the "Cold War" into a permanent foundation of its policy. He called on the United Nations to adopt the effective and practical measures proposed in the Soviet proposal to safeguard peace.

### 联合国大会全体会议继续开会  波兰代表要求通过苏联和平提案

    联合国大会全体会议继续开会
    波兰代表要求通过苏联和平提案
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社二十四日讯：联合国大会于九月二十三日上午及下午举行全体会议，继续进行一般辩论。
    在上午会议上，第一个发言的是加拿大代表皮尔逊。他说现在有了在某种程度上缓和国际紧张局势的机会，希望本届大会充分利用这个机会。然而，皮尔逊将国际紧张局势的缓和归功于北大西洋侵略集团的存在，并对这个集团大加赞扬。他谈到了这个集团内部的分歧，但是他企图证明这种分歧并不很严重。皮尔逊扼要地说明了加拿大政府对朝鲜问题的态度。他说，加拿大政府不支持朝鲜境内不属于联合国行动的任何敌对行为，并反对想把联合国的目标解释为包括用武力统一朝鲜的任何企图。皮尔逊又说，加拿大政府知道停战协定的签字并没有解除加拿大作为一个联合国会员国在朝鲜所承担的义务。皮尔逊在演说中用了相当大的一部分对民主阵营进行攻击，并大量重复杜勒斯九月十七日在联合国大会的演说中的言论。
    波兰代表团团长纳斯科夫斯基接着发言。他指出，朝鲜停战引起了各国人民对于顺利解决其他国际争端的希望。但是联合国迄今并未利用由于停战而产生的各种可能。大会非但没有决定召开成分广泛的政治会议以为解决朝鲜问题和威胁远东和平的其他问题创造条件，相反地它企图强使中华人民共和国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府接受对立双方会议形式，不让那些非常关心和平解决朝鲜问题的亚洲国家参加。美国及其支持者的这种政策打击了亚洲国家的权利。纳斯科夫斯基指出，中朝两国政府对联合国秘书长的答复是对和平解决朝鲜问题所作的又一次贡献。这两个文件使联合国有机会回到唯一正确的道路上来，回到举行有中立国、首先有亚洲国家参加的圆桌会议的道路上来。联合国应该重新研究朝鲜政治会议问题。
    波兰代表指责美国对苏联和各人民民主国家进行的破坏活动。他又说，美国和其他北大西洋集团国家的无限制的扩张军备运动仍然是国际紧张局势的特别危险的根源之一。他要求大会通过苏联“关于消除另一次世界大战的威胁和缓和国际紧张局势的措施”的提案。
    波兰代表说，为了完成巩固和平的任务，联合国必须消除现在这种没有伟大的中国人民的代表参加联合国的荒谬情况。这种情况不仅违反了联合国宪章、违反了中国人民的不容争辩的权利，而且对世界政局中重大问题的解决增加了困难。在世界政局之中，中国人民是具有极重大意义的一个因素。
    古巴代表的演说对美国外交政策大为捧场。
    在下午的会议上，危地马拉代表托列里约·加利多首先发言。他说，危地马拉代表团主张，“一切理所当然地关怀亚洲协调的国家的当然权利都应受到尊重”。危地马拉代表发言的极大部分是揭露美国垄断资本和统治集团对危地马拉的政策。他说，危地马拉实行了土地改革，并公布施行了一些能促进国家经济发展和保障民族独立的法令。这就触犯了“外国垄断资本的利益”。美国垄断资本，尤其是联合水果公司，正在美国统治集团的支持下竭力设法推翻危地马拉现政府，并破坏它的工作成果。他接着说，在联合国中，把外国投资说成是拯救落后国家的灵丹妙药的话是够多的了。但是，外国公司在落后国家中的投资恰恰就是造成这些国家经济落后的主要原因。以危地马拉为例，外国垄断资本控制了它的港口设备、主要运输和通讯设备及电力生产等，紧紧抓住发展经济的基本命脉。危地马拉代表说，他希望联合国所主张的扩大对落后国家的投资，不会把美国联合水果公司对危地马拉的这种投资作为“榜样”。他又说，殖民时代已经结束，殖民制度必须在地球上绝迹。危地马拉代表的发言博得了许多代表和来宾经久不息的掌声。
    南非联邦和厄瓜多尔代表发言，替美国捧场。阿比西尼亚代表要求尽速解决种族歧视问题，要求联合国给予落后国家更多的经济援助并协助殖民地人民得到独立。
    最后发言的是乌克兰代表巴拉诺夫斯基。他说：朝鲜停战是“实力政策”的一个严重的失败，是主张和平解决国际争端的政策的胜利。但是，在使国际关系正常化的道路上还有许多严重障碍。他说：杜勒斯的演说丝毫没有表示美国打算注意各国人民的普遍努力，打算停止“冷战”和军备竞赛，相反地，他的演说整篇都是要求苏联作单方面的让步。乌克兰代表说，印度代表说得对，美国正企图把“冷战”变成它的政策的永久基础。他要求联合国采纳苏联提案中提出的有效实际措施来保障和平。
