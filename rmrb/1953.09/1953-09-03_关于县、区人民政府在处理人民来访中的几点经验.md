Since the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued the "Decision on Handling People's Letters and Receiving People's Visits" in June 1951, it has attracted the attention of Party and government organs at all levels in various regions. Especially in North China and Central South China, typical cases such as Zhang Shunyou and Ji Kaifu were seized upon and dealt with in a vigorous manner, severely cracking down on the bureaucratic work style of some organs and personnel. Throughout the country, inspections and cleanups were conducted on cases raised in people's letters and visits. Few people dared to treat the issues raised in people's letters and visits as "minor matters" that could be ignored, arbitrarily delayed, or dealt with by simply "suppressing" them. However, generally speaking, we have not been able to carry out this work very well. Our work still lags far behind the needs of the rapidly developing objective situation. The phenomenon of county and district people's government organs, especially local people's government organs, accumulating people's letters and visits still exists in large numbers. To fundamentally solve this problem, it is necessary to strengthen guidance and assistance to county and district people's governments in handling people's letters and visits, so that county and district people's governments in various regions can establish a higher prestige in handling people's letters and visits, and the masses fully believe that county and district people's governments can solve problems. Only in this way can we avoid the phenomenon of government organs at all levels being busy with simply copying and forwarding, resulting in the accumulation of cases. The masses also do not need to spend money and affect production due to long-distance complaints.

Due to efforts over the recent period, county and district people's governments across the country have generally launched and improved the handling of people's letters and visits. Some counties and districts have achieved greater results because they have gained new experiences and created new methods in their work. For example, in Hailong County, Liaodong Province, out of 78 cases originally transferred by the County People's Supervisory Committee to some units for inspection and handling, less than 20 were handled in the past five months. After key inspections, 41 cases were handled in less than a month, and they were all handled very well, to the great satisfaction of the masses. The Jin County People's Supervisory Committee in Liaoxi Province, with the attention and support of the leading organs this spring, joined relevant departments to inspect and handle nine major cases with relatively serious circumstances in connection with the central task, setting an example for the whole county. As a result, the handling of people's letters and visits by various districts was promoted. The County People's Supervisory Committee has accepted 156 cases of people's letters and visits in the past six months, and more than two-thirds have been resolved in a timely manner. In Changli County, Hebei Province, due to the timely handling of most of the accumulated cases in the past, the prestige of the county and district people's governments has been raised. Not only have people's letters and visits increased rapidly, but most of them are directly delivered by the masses with their signatures, and those transferred by higher authorities or anonymously delivered have gradually decreased. From April to June, 107 new cases were received in three months. Except for a few that are being transferred to relevant departments, most have been dealt with, and the phenomenon of case accumulation has basically been eliminated.

The reasons why the above three counties have achieved some success in handling people's letters and visits are mainly the following:

First, leadership's attention is the main key to carrying out the work. In the first half of this year, Hailong County held four meetings of relevant departments throughout the county, convened by leading cadres, to study how to do a good job in handling people's letters and visits, specifically discussed, summarized experiences, and specifically explained working methods. In June, the responsible comrades of the County People's Government personally convened a meeting of responsible cadres from 14 units under the county to inspect the work of handling people's letters and visits. At the same time, some main cadres were drawn to cooperate with the central work, went to key districts and townships for investigation, and handled many accumulated cases that could not be solved for a long time. The Jin County Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed all districts in March of this year to designate one member of the District Committee to concurrently handle the handling of people's letters and visits. Each summary of work must be reported as one of the main items. Later, this work was continuously deployed and inspected at the county party representative meeting and the joint meeting of district party secretaries and district chiefs. The county party committee also regularly conducts special discussions, and important cases are personally approved by the main responsible comrades of the county. After the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violation of laws and discipline began in Changli County, the county party committee designated a deputy secretary to specifically lead the handling of people's letters and visits, and stipulated that a meeting of relevant personnel from several important county-level departments should be held once a month to inspect and summarize experiences. The county head often personally reads important letters and receives visiting masses, and promptly sends people to deal with the problems raised by the masses.

Secondly, the method of "organizing" should be adopted to carry out work in a planned and led manner. This not only fixes the work through a certain organizational form and makes it regular, but also avoids the phenomenon of decentralization and overcomes the weaknesses of "going it alone." Most districts in Jin County, Liaoxi Province, have established "Working Groups for Handling People's Letters and Visits," led by the Secretary of the District Committee of the Communist Party of China, with the participation of key cadres such as the Organization and Propaganda Committee members of the District Committee, and the Civil Affairs and Public Security Assistants of the District People's Government, who are respectively responsible for grasping the situation and investigating materials. Every important case is researched and discussed, and then handled carefully according to the case and in connection with the central work. In Changli County, Hebei Province, the County People's Supervisory Committee, the Discipline Inspection Committee of the County Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the Civil Affairs Section of the County People's Government jointly drew a portion of cadres to form a specialized "Joint Working Group" to handle people's letters and visits, often carrying files to the countryside for touring processing. At the same time, according to the size of the case and the different circumstances of simple and complex, the methods of "centralized research and joint handling" or "centralized research and separate handling" are adopted respectively. As the number of people's letters and visits in various units has increased, it often happens that one case involves several departments, or several cases of different nature occur in the same area. If each department adopts the method of "going it alone," it is often difficult to unify ideas when discussing and handling with relevant departments. Moreover, sometimes the cadres sent are of poor ability and low level, and do not fully understand the situation, and are unable to make up their minds when encountering problems, resulting in repeated investigations and delays in solving the problem. The method of "organizing" basically overcomes these shortcomings. For example, the problem of corruption by cadres in Yanshang Village, Fifth District of the county, was serious. The masses complained for three years, and the county and district sent people to handle it many times, but it was not resolved due to partial listening and credulous belief. This time, after "Joint Working Group" conducted centralized research, this accumulated case was quickly handled.

Thirdly, the implementation of case queuing, distinguishing between priorities, and adopting different methods for different natures can avoid the chaos of the past, correct the past methods of "first come, first served" and "first handled the top down", and fundamentally change the long-term state of being responsive and passive. Hailong County unified and queued all accepted cases within a certain period, and handled them differently according to different circumstances. Important and complicated cases were directly controlled by the County People's Supervisory Committee. Those involving several departments were assigned to the relevant units to organize joint inspections. Relatively simple cases were handled by the competent units alone. In Changli County, "case queuing" is further divided into two types: "large queue" and "small queue." "Small queues" are arranged by each agency every five to seven days on their own. Simple cases are handled while queuing, laying the foundation for "large queues." "Large queues" are jointly conducted by several major county-level departments every fifteen to twenty days, dividing the cases into three categories: those that are relatively easy to handle are transferred to the relevant units for processing; those related to several departments are assigned to the relevant units to form "temporary joint groups" for processing; and cases with complex and larger content are all directly controlled and processed by the "joint working group" composed of various departments. For cases with typical educational significance, the "joint working group" concentrates its efforts and carries out vigorous handling to achieve the effect of breaking through key points, promoting the general, educating cadres, and improving work.

In addition, because each county has paid attention to specifically explaining working methods in handling cases, the difficulties or concerns of cadres who "have no idea what to do when encountering things" or "are afraid of being responsible for handling errors" have also been eliminated. In handling cases, each county strives to proceed in connection with the central task on the principle of not hindering production, and thus has been supported by the masses. When announcing the handling results, those that should be announced by the district should be announced by the district. County leaders should always pay attention to establishing the prestige of district-level organs, so that the masses trust the leadership of the district.

    关于县、区人民政府在处理人民来访中的几点经验
    中央人民监察委员会办公厅
    一九五一年六月中央人民政府政务院发布了
    “关于处理人民来信和接待人民工作的决定”以后，引起了各地各级党及政府机关的重视。尤其在华北、中南各地，抓住了张顺有、纪凯夫等典型事件，大张旗鼓地进行处理，严重打击了部分机关和人员的官僚主义作风。在全国范围内，对于人民来信来访中提出的案件都曾进行检查和清理，已经很少有人敢于再把人民来信、来访所提出的问题当作
    “小事情”，可以不闻不问，任意推拖，或以“一压了之”的态度来对待这一工作。然而从总的情况来说，我们却还未能把这一工作进行得很好。我们的工作还远赶不上客观情况迅速发展的需要。各级人民政府机关特别是地方人民政府机关积压人民来信、来访案件的现象仍大量存在。为了从根本上解决这一问题，必须注意加强对县、区人民政府处理人民来信、来访工作的指导和帮助，以使各地县、区人民政府在处理人民来信、来访中建立起更高的威信，使群众完全相信县、区人民政府可以解决问题。也只有如此，才有可能避免各级政府机关忙于照抄照转，以致形成案件积压的现象；群众也不必再因远道控告而耗费钱财，影响生产。
    由于最近一个期间的努力，全国各地县、区人民政府对于处理人民来信、来访工作，已有了普遍的开展和改进。有些县、区，由于在工作中摸到了一些新的经验，创造了一些新的方法，因而成绩较大。如辽东省海龙县原由县人民监察委员会转交一些单位检查处理的七十八起案件，在过去五个月中，处理的还不到二十件；经过重点检查后，不到一个月，便处理了四十一件，并且都处理的很好，群众非常满意。辽西省锦县人民监察委员会，在本年春季由于得到了领导机关的重视和支持，曾联合有关部门，结合中心工作，检查处理了九件情节比较严重的重大案件，为全县树立了榜样，因而推动了各区对人民来信、来访案件的处理工作。该县人民监察委员会半年来受理人民来信、来访案件一百五十六件，已有三分之二以上得到及时解决。河北省昌黎县由于以往积案大部及时处理，县、区人民政府的威信因之提高，人民来信、来访不但迅速增加，而且多是群众签署姓名直接投递的，由上级转交或匿名投递的已日渐减少。从四月到六月三个月内，新收案件一百零七件，除有少数正在转交有关部门外，大部都已作了处理，案件积压现象基本上已消除了。
    上述三县处理人民来信、来访能获得一些成绩的原因，主要有下列几点：
    首先，领导重视是开展工作的主要关键。海龙县在今年上半年为了研究如何做好对人民来信、来访的处理工作，曾由领导干部召开全县有关部门会议四次，专门进行讨论，总结经验，具体交代工作方法。在六月份，并由县人民政府的负责同志亲自召集县属十四个单位的负责干部开会，检查处理人民来信、来访的工作；同时，并抽调一些主要干部，配合中心工作，分赴重点区乡，进行调查，处理了很多长久不能解决的积案。中共锦县县委在本年三月曾指示各区必须指定区委委员一人兼办对于人民来信、来访的处理工作，每次总结工作，必须作为汇报的主要项目之一；以后并在县党代表会议和区委书记、区长联席会议上，不断地布置、检查这一工作；县委也定期进行专门讨论，重要案件由县的主要负责同志亲自核批。昌黎县在反官僚主义、反命令主义、反违法乱纪斗争开始后，便由县委指定副书记一人专门领导人民来信、来访的处理工作，并规定每月召集县级几个重要部门有关人员开一次会，进行检查和总结经验；该县县长更经常亲自批阅重要来信和接见来访群众，并及时派人处理群众所提出的问题。
    其次，采取“组织起来”的方法，有领导有计划地进行工作。这样不但由于通过一定的组织形式把工作固定下来并使之经常化，而且避免了分散现象，克服了“单干”的弱点。辽西省锦县各区大都成立了“处理人民来信来访工作小组”，由中共区委书记亲自领导，区委的组织、宣传委员，区人民政府的民政、公安助理等主要干部参加，分别负责掌握情况，调查材料；每一重要案件都经过研究讨论，然后根据案情，结合中心工作慎重地进行处理。河北省昌黎县由县人民监察委员会、中共县委纪律检查委员会以及县人民政府民政科等几个主要部门，共同抽调一部分干部，组成专门巡回处理人民来信来访案件的“联合工作组”，经常携卷下乡，进行巡回处理；同时根据案件大小或简单复杂的不同情况，分别采取“集中研究，联合处理”或“集中研究，分头处理”的办法。由于各单位人民来信来访案件日益增多，常有一个案件牵涉到几个部门，或几个不同性质的案件发生在同一地区的情况，如果各部门采取“单干”的方法，往往在和有关部门研究处理时，思想上不易统一，更有时由于所派干部能力差，水平低，了解情况不全面，遇事拿不定主意，因而往返多次调查，拖延了问题的解决。采取“组织起来”的办法，就基本上克服了这些缺点。例如该县五区崖上村干部贪污问题严重，群众控告三年，经县、区派人多次处理，都由于偏听偏信迄未解决；这次经过“联合工作组”集中研究后，很快地便处理了这件积案。
    再次，实行案件排队，分别轻重缓急，按照不同性质，采取不同方法进行处理，这样就可以避免过去的混乱现象，纠正了过去那种“先来的先办”“上边交下来的先办”等办法，基本上改变了长期处于应付、被动的状态。海龙县在一定时期将所有受理案件统一排队，分别不同情况，采取不同办法加以处理。重要复杂的案件，都由县人民监察委员会直接掌握；凡涉及几个部门的便责成有关单位组织联合检查；比较简单的交由主管单位单独办理。昌黎县在“案件排队”中，更分成“大排”“小排”两种。“小排”由各机关五天至七天自行排列一次，简单的案件边排边作处理，并为“大排”打下基础。“大排”是由县属几个主要部门十五天至二十天联合进行一次，将案件分成三类：比较容易处理的即转有关单位处理；关系几个部门的，便责成有关单位组成“临时联合小组”处理；内容复杂较大的案件，统由各部门所组成的“联合工作组”直接掌握处理。对其中具有典型教育意义的案件，“联合工作组”便集中力量，大张旗鼓地进行处理，以收突破重点，推动一般，教育干部，改进工作的效果。
    此外，由于各县都注意了在处理案件中具体交代工作方法，这样，也就解除了过去干部“遇事没主意”或“怕处理错了负责任”的困难或顾虑。在处理案件中，各县力求结合中心工作在不妨碍生产的原则下去进行，因而也就受到群众的拥护。宣布处理结果时，应由区宣布的便由区宣布，县的领导干部应该经常注意树立区级机关的威信，使群众信赖区的领导。    （新华社）
