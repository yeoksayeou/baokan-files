    I Began Tutoring in the Study of the "History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)"
    Song Wansheng

    I am a tutor for cadres in Huanggu District, Shenyang City, studying the "History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)." In early July this year, I participated in the "History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)" tutoring training class held by the Propaganda Department of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the CPC. The training class put forward two requirements for tutors: first, to study well themselves, and second, to tutor others well. This is an arduous and glorious task entrusted to us by the Party. Because my own theoretical level is not high and I lack tutoring experience, it is really difficult to complete this task. However, in order to be responsible to the Party and to my comrades, I plucked up my courage and did my best to take on the tutoring work for the study of the "History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)." Thus, according to the requirements of the Municipal Party Committee, I began my tutoring work.

    After returning from the training class, the first question I considered was the basic situation and conditions for conducting tutoring work. A total of twenty-eight comrades in our Huanggu District are studying the "History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)," scattered in several organs such as the District Government, Public Security Bureau, Taxation Bureau, two state-owned factories, and the District Committee of the CPC. These twenty-eight comrades are unfamiliar with the "History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)" course, have a poor foundation, and several comrades originally studied political common sense and are now newly joined. This is the basic situation of my tutoring objects. However, the comrades participating in this study are very enthusiastic and have a high learning enthusiasm, which is a good condition for me to carry out tutoring work and must be consolidated and fully utilized. According to this situation, I believe that we must firmly grasp the comrades' learning enthusiasm, start from the existing foundation, and carry out tutoring work in a practical manner.

    After returning from the training class, it happened that the comrades were previewing Chapters 7 and 8 of the "History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)." In order to help the comrades deeply understand and comprehend the content of Chapters 7 and 8, and to understand their actual level, I pointed out reference books for studying these two chapters based on my personal learning experience (such as Chapters 9, 10, and 11 of the "A Brief History of Lenin's Life and Career," and Chapters 5 and 6 of "A Biography of Stalin"). In order to examine the effect of doing so, I talked with some comrades in the District Committee, and they felt that pointing out such reference books was appropriate and easy to understand. However, this was only a preliminary attempt at my tutoring work, and I was not very clear about the situation at the time. Immediately afterwards, I did the second thing.

    In order to prepare for the study of Chapter 9 of the "History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)," I prepared a list of reference books (including required and supplementary parts) and handed it over to the Propaganda Department of the District Committee for printing and distribution to all students, so that they could prepare as early as possible. At the same time, it was pointed out that when reading Chapter 9, it is necessary to repeatedly read the original text and then read the designated reference documents. At this time, it was found that many comrades had difficulty reading reference books and could not grasp the center when reading the original text of Chapter 9, and there was a phenomenon that they could not delve into it. Therefore, I considered how to help everyone study further. Before the lecture on Chapter 9, I gathered everyone together with the Propaganda Department of the District Committee and gave everyone an introduction to the central content and main points of Chapter 9 based on what I had learned in the training class. Everyone's reaction was good after listening, and they asked for the main points of this content to be printed and distributed. This shows that it has been of some help to everyone.

    After the first lecture on Chapter 9 of the "History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)," in order to better help the comrades digest the content of the lecture and get inspiration from some reference books, several reference documents were arranged according to the content of the lecture. At that time, it was pointed out that the original text of Chapter 9 should be repeatedly read first, and then the necessary reference books should be read. The second lecture was also done in this way.

    After Chapter 9 of the "History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)" was completely lectured, the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee issued discussion questions. I pointed out the focus, main points, and the purpose to be achieved by each question to everyone; and in order to facilitate the comrades to look up reference books, I also pointed out the chapters and pages of the reference books according to the questions, and even pointed out the line numbers in some places. When arranging the study on August 19, I also introduced some study methods on how to study in self-study for the comrades to refer to.

    The above are the few tutoring works that I have done so far. Because the tutoring work has just begun, I have not yet gained any experience, but from this period of tutoring work, I have initially realized the following three points.

    First, tutoring work must start from the actual level of the students. Judging from the actual situation in our district, the theoretical level of the students is not very uniform, and the foundation is poor. Generally speaking, the students' enthusiasm for learning is not small, but they do not "get started," so there is a phenomenon that they cannot delve into it. Therefore, the tutor should start from the actual level of the students and inspire them to study independently. When arranging reference books and pointing out the main points, it is necessary to base on the actual level of the students. If the reference books are deeper, they should be explained in detail, and the reference books pointed out should be as "few but refined" as possible to suit the level of the students. Secondly, because these comrades used to be accustomed to the way of listening to lectures and discussions, this year there is more time for self-study, and when the habit of self-study has not yet been established, there will be some difficulties. Therefore, it is also necessary to combine self-study, casual talks, group discussions, and large group discussions according to this situation.

    Second, tutoring work should be carried out specifically and step by step. According to the regulations of the Municipal Party Committee, the study time for Chapter 9 of the "History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)" is three and a half months. In such a long time, there are only two lectures and one special report. The remaining time is mainly for self-study and appropriate discussions. If the tutor only arranges the reference books in principle and lets the students study independently, the students will have a phenomenon that they cannot delve into it due to their poor foundation and the habit of self-study has not yet been formed. Therefore, the tutor must specifically arrange the entire tutoring work, have a clear idea, and carry it out step by step. If tutoring is not carried out in this specific way, the tutoring work will become a formality and will not play its due role.

    Third, to do tutoring work, it is necessary to strengthen self-study, and first of all, you must study well yourself. To measure myself against the task of a tutor in the intermediate group, I feel that I am far behind; so after returning from the training class, I thought: I must delve into it, study hard, and learn more myself. Although I cannot know much more than the comrades, I must take the first step, otherwise I will not be able to do a good job in tutoring. Now I have strengthened my own study and increased my study time by about half an hour to an hour every night. Whether I can complete this task assigned to me by the Party well depends on my efforts in the future. But I am determined to work harder in the tutoring work of the "History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)" under the leadership and education of the Party and with the supervision and help of the comrades.

### 我开始了“联共（布）党史”学习的辅导工作

    我开始了“联共（布）党史”学习的辅导工作
    宋万盛
    我是沈阳市皇姑区干部学习“联共（布）党史”的辅导员。今年七月初，我参加了中共沈阳市委宣传部举办的“联共（布）党史”学习辅导员训练班。训练班对辅导员提出了两项要求，一是自己要学好，一是把别人辅导好。这是党交给我们的一项艰巨而光荣的任务。因为我自己的理论水平不高，又缺乏辅导工作经验，要完成这个任务，委实感到吃力。但是，为了对党和对同志们负责，我还是鼓起勇气，尽我的力量把“联共（布）党史”学习的辅导工作担负起来。于是就根据市委的要求，开始了我的辅导工作。
    我从训练班回来以后，首先考虑的一个问题，就是进行辅导工作的基本情况和条件如何。我们皇姑区学习“联共（布）党史”的同志一共二十八人，分散在区政府、公安分局、税务分局、两个国营工厂和中共区委会等几个机关。这二十八名同志对“联共（布）党史”这门课程都很生疏，基础也差，还有几个同志是原来学习政治常识，现在新加入的。这就是我的辅导对象的基本情况。但是，参加这次学习的同志劲头都挺足，学习热情很高，这就是我进行辅导工作的一个良好条件，必须加以巩固和充分运用。根据这样的情况，我认为必须紧紧抓住同志们的学习热情，从现有基础出发，切合实际地开展辅导工作。
    从训练班回来后，正赶上同志们预习“联共（布）党史”第七、八两章。为了帮助同志们深入地了解和领会七、八两章的内容，并且想了解一下他们的实际程度，于是我就根据个人的学习体会，指出了学习这两章的参考书（例如“列宁生平事业简史”第九、十、十一各章，“斯大林传略”第五、六两章等）。为了考察这样做的效果，我就和区委的部分同志谈了一下，他们感到指出这样的参考书还合适，容易领会。不过，这是我辅导工作的初步尝试，对当时情况还不太摸底。紧接着我就做了第二件工作。
    为了给“联共（布）党史”第九章的学习作好准备，我拟了个参考书目录（包括必读部分与补充部分），交区委宣传部印发给各个学员，以便及早准备。同时指出，阅读第九章时，必须反复阅读原文，再看指定的参考文件。这时，发现不少同志阅读参考书有困难，阅读九章原文时抓不住中心，有钻不进去的现象。于是，我就考虑怎样帮助大家学习深入一步。在第九章听课之前，我同区委宣传部一起把大家召集来，根据我在训练班学习的心得，把第九章的中心内容、要点向大家做了一番介绍。大家听了后，反应还好，并要求把这个内容要点印发一下。这就说明，对大家有了一点帮助。
    在“联共（布）党史”第九章讲过第一讲之后，为了更好地帮助同志们消化所讲的内容，及从一些参考书中得到启示，又按所讲的内容，布置了几个参考文件。当时并指出要先反复阅读第九章原文，然后再阅读必要的参考书。第二讲也是这样做的。
    “联共（布）党史”第九章全部讲完后，市委宣传部发下了讨论题。我就把讨论题的重心、要点及每个题要达到的目的，指给大家；并且为了便于同志们翻看参考书，又按题指出了参考书的章页，甚至有的地方还指出了行数。在八月十九日布置时，还把自学中如何钻研的学习方法也做了一些介绍，供同志们参考。
    上面就是我到现在为止做了的几件辅导工作。因为辅导工作刚开始，还没有摸到什么经验，但从这一个时期辅导工作当中，我初步地体会到了下面三点。
    第一、辅导工作必须从学员的实际水平出发。从我们区里的实际情况看来，学员理论水平不很齐，基础也差。一般学员学习劲头还不小，只是不“入门”，所以有钻不进去的现象。因此，辅导员就应该从学员的实际水平出发，启发他们自学。在布置参考书，指出要点时都必须根据学员实际水平，如果参考书深一些，要详细讲一下，同时指的参考书尽量要“少而精”，适合学员水平。其次，因为这些同志过去习惯了听课、讨论的方式，今年自学时间多，在自学习惯还没有树立起来时，就有些困难。所以，也要根据这种情况，把自修、漫谈、小组讨论、大组讨论等方式结合起来进行。
    第二、辅导工作要具体地、有步骤地进行。按市委规定，“联共（布）党史”第九章的学习时间是三个半月。在这样长的时间内，讲课只有两次，有一次专题报告，剩下时间主要是自学和适当的讨论。如果辅导员只原则地布置一下参考书就让学员们自学，由于学员们基础差、自学习惯尚未养成，就会产生钻不下去的现象。所以，辅导员必须把整个辅导工作具体安排一下，心里有数，一步一步地开展下去。不这样具体地进行辅导，辅导工作就会流于形式，起不到应有的作用。
    第三、要做辅导工作，必须加强自学，首先自己要学好。拿中级组辅导员的任务来衡量一下自己，我感到自己是差得很远的；所以从训练班回来后，我就想：一定要钻下去，苦学，自己多学一些，多看些参考书，虽然不能比同志们多知道很多，但也要先走一步，不这样是做不好辅导工作的。现在我已加强了自己的学习，差不多每天晚上增加半小时到一小时的学习时间。究竟能不能很好地完成党交给我的这个任务，还要看今后我的努力如何。但我决心在党的领导和教育下，在同志们督促和帮助下，尽力在“联共（布）党史”学习辅导工作方面多做些工作。
