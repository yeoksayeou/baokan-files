The farmers of the Zhang Zhongcai Agricultural Production Cooperative in Bajiazi Village, Songjiang Boli County, are all troubled by the sheep flock problem. The sheep flock problem has caused them great losses, and now it has reached a point where it must be resolved.

Last spring, when this agricultural production cooperative was still a mutual aid team, the work team of the Boli County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in order to help them "enrich production content," mobilized everyone to develop sheep flocks. The comrades of the work team said: "These sheep are all Merino sheep, good breed, cheap, and no cash outlay is required. The wool produced in one year is enough to cover the sheep herder's expenses, and the offspring can fully offset the loan interest. Manure accumulation for increased production is pure profit." Although this was said, the general public was still unwilling to raise sheep. In order to eliminate the concerns of the masses, they continued to mobilize for three nights, and only then did they get through to the masses, and everyone "agreed" to raise sheep.

Soon, eighty-three "no cash outlay" Merino sheep were driven back, but where to graze them became a serious problem. At first, they drove them into the forest, and were immediately criticized by the comrades of the Forest Protection Committee, who said they violated the "closing mountains for forest cultivation" policy. Later, they drove them onto the grassy roads, and before they could take care of them, they trampled the crops in the fields; they drove them to the riverbank, but the grass was sparse and the land was narrow, and the sheep could not get enough to eat. ... Due to these difficulties, no one was willing to herd the sheep.

Later, although a rotational grazing system was established and more sheep herders were hired, the situation of raising sheep did not improve because of the lack of pasture and sheep raising experience. For more than a year, the masses did not get any of the benefits of raising sheep that the comrades of the work team originally said. The comrades of the work team said: "The wool produced in one year is enough to cover the sheep herder's expenses." The actual situation is: because the sheep flock suffered from scabies, the wool quality was low. In more than a year, only 800,000 yuan was sold, which was just enough to cover the cost of building the sheep pen and the labor costs for shearing the sheep. The sheep herder's fee of 8.2 million yuan and the medical expenses of 2.3 million yuan for treating the sheep flock's scabies had to be paid from agricultural production. The comrades of the work team said: "The offspring can fully offset the loan interest." The actual situation is: although a lot of sheep have been bred in more than a year, at the same time, because of improper feeding, many sheep have also died. After offsetting the losses, the number of sheep remains the same. However, the amount of bank loan interest has increased to 4.5 million yuan, and the drop in sheep prices will result in another loss of 5.3 million yuan.

Such astonishing losses have seriously affected the farmers' production enthusiasm. Recently, when the cooperative discussed the handling of the sheep flock incident, many people advocated selling the sheep, and even a deaf-mute person personally wrote a note, saying, "Anything else is fine, just not sheep!" If they want to sell the sheep, not only is the sheep price low, but no one will buy them at all. If they can't sell the sheep, no one is at ease. Some members want to withdraw from the cooperative, some members want to return the sheep to the government, and Director Zhang Zhongcai is frowning all day long.

    Editor's note: The Boli County Committee work team's blind mobilization of farmers to raise sheep is another example of turning a good thing into a bad thing by disregarding the needs of the masses, not proceeding from reality, and only proceeding from subjective wishes. It is suggested that the Boli County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party quickly help the Zhang Zhongcai Agricultural Production Cooperative solve this problem, and learn the necessary lessons from it to educate cadres.

    盲目发展羊群的教训
    松江勃利县八家子村张中才农业生产合作社的农民们，都为羊群问题苦恼着。羊群问题使他们遭受到很大的损失，现在已经到了不能不解决的时候了。
    去年春天，当这个农业生产合作社还是互助组的时候，中共勃利县委工作组为帮助他们“充实生产内容”，就动员大家发展羊群。工作组的同志说：“养的这批羊都是美利奴羊，种好，便宜，又不掏现钱，一年光出羊毛就足够羊倌开支，繁殖的崽满可抵住贷款利息，积肥增产是净赚。”虽然这样，一般群众还是不愿养羊。为了消除群众顾虑，又连续动员了三夜，这才打通了群众的思想，大家“同意”了养羊。
    很快，八十三只“不掏现钱”的美利奴羊都赶回来了，但是，到那里去牧放呢？却成了严重的问题。开始，他们赶到树林里，立刻被护林委员会的同志批评了一顿，说他们违犯了“封山育林”的政策。后来，赶到茅道上，一眼照顾不到，就糟踏了地里的庄稼；赶到河边，草薄地窄羊吃不饱。……由于有这些困难，谁都不愿意放羊。
    以后，虽然建立了轮流放羊制，增雇了羊倌，可是，因为缺乏牧场和养羊经验，养羊的情况并没有改善。一年多来，工作组同志原来所说的养羊的好处，群众一点也没有得到；工作组同志说：“一年光出羊毛就足够羊倌开支”。实际情况是：因为羊群生癞，羊毛质量低劣，一年多来只卖八十万元，刚够盖羊栅和剪羊毛的人工费。八百二十万元的羊倌费、二百三十万元医治羊群癞疾的医药费，完全需要由农业生产中开支。工作组同志说：“繁殖的崽满可抵住贷款利息”。实际情况是：一年多来，固然繁殖了不少的羊，同时，因为饲养不得法，却也死亡了不少的羊，出入相抵，羊的数目依然如故。可是，银行贷款利息的数目却增加到了四百五十万元，羊价跌落又要赔五百三十万元。
    这样惊人的赔累，严重地影响了农民的生产情绪。最近，该社讨论处理羊群事件时，许多人都主张卖羊，甚至连一个哑吧也亲自写了一张纸条，表示“别的啥事都行，就是不要羊！”要卖羊，不但羊价贱，而且根本没人买。卖不了羊，群众谁也不安心，有的社员要出社，有的社员要给政府退羊，主任张中才弄得整日愁眉苦脸。
      编者按：勃利县委工作组盲目动员农民养羊，是不顾群众需要，不从实际出发，只从主观愿望出发，把好事办成坏事的又一个例子。建议中共勃利县委迅速帮助张中才农业生产合作社解决这一问题，并从中取得应有教训以教育干部。
