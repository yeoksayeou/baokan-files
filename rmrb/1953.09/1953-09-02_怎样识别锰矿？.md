    How to Identify Manganese Ore?
    Manganese has many uses: in the steel industry, it can be made into alloys and used as a refining agent; in the chemical industry, it can be used to manufacture dry batteries, contact agents, disinfectants, paint and ink drying agents, as well as colorants and decolorizers for the glass and ceramics industries.
    There are two common types of manganese ore: hard manganese ore (psilomelane) and soft manganese ore (pyrolusite). Hard manganese ore has greater hardness and can only be scratched with a file, but its specific gravity is small; soft manganese ore has less hardness and can be scratched with a fingernail, but its specific gravity is greater. Both of these ores are iron-black in color with a submetallic luster. Although each belongs to a specific crystal system, the vast majority do not have crystalline forms: common hard manganese ore shapes are massive, botryoidal, and grape-like, and sometimes appear as nodules like sheep droppings at the foot of mountains; common soft manganese ore shapes are massive, columnar, and fibrous. Sometimes, manganese-containing solutions form patterns like bunches of small grass or tree branches on the fracture surfaces of rocks (in the Nankou area of Hebei Province, it is called painting stone or pine forest stone); this type of stone cannot become manganese ore and has no economic value. Hard manganese ore and soft manganese ore are both composed of manganese dioxide, but hard manganese ore contains many impurities.
    In addition, manganite is also an important manganese oxide, with a color of dark steel gray or iron-black, a streak of reddish-brown, and a submetallic luster. It can be scratched with a knife and often forms striated columnar crystals. There is also rhodochrosite, which is pink to brown in color, with a vitreous or pearly luster, translucent, and a white streak. This ore is brittle and easily broken, and breaks into rhomboid shapes or has complete rhomboid faces; it will also bubble in acid. Rhodochrosite is not as widely distributed as soft manganese ore and hard manganese ore, but there are also large deposits.

    怎样识别锰矿？
    锰的用途很多：在钢铁工业中可以做成合金后用作洗净剂；在化学工业中可以用来制造干电池、接触剂、消毒剂、油漆和墨水的干燥剂以及玻璃和陶器工业的着色剂和脱色剂等。
    常见的锰矿有二种：硬锰矿和软锰矿。硬锰矿的硬度较大，须用刀锉才能划动，但其比重较小；软锰矿的硬度较小，用指甲即可划动，但其比重较大。这两种矿的矿石都是铁黑色，半金属光泽。它们虽然各自都属于一定的晶系，但是外形绝大多数都不具晶形：常见的硬锰矿形状是块状、钟乳石状和葡萄状，有时也会结核出现为山麓的转石，一颗一颗的好像羊粪；软锰矿常见的形状是块状、柱状和纤维状。有时含锰溶液在岩石的裂隙面上生成像一束束的小草或树枝状的花纹（在河北省南口一带把它叫做画石或松林石）；这种石头成不了锰矿，没有什么经济价值。硬锰矿和软锰矿成分都是二氧化锰，但硬锰矿内杂质很多。
    此外，水锰矿也是一种重要的锰的氧化物，它的颜色是深钢灰色或铁黑色，条痕多为红褐色，半金属光泽，用小刀即可把它划动，常成有条纹的柱状结晶。还有一种菱锰矿，颜色是粉红色至褐色，呈玻璃或珍珠光泽，半透明，白色条痕。这种矿石质脆易碎，碎后成菱形体或具有完整的菱形面；放在酸中也可起泡。菱锰矿不如软锰矿和硬锰矿分布的那样普遍，但也有较大的矿床。
