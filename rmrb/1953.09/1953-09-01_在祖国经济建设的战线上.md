    On the Battlefront of National Economic Construction
    Northeast Electric Engineering Plant No. 7 Expansion Project to Commence
    One of the key construction projects in China's machinery industry, the expansion project of the Northeast Electric Engineering Plant No. 7, is about to commence. Once completed, this plant will become the largest modern cable factory in China.
    As the commencement date approaches, preparations are intensifying. Demolition work is currently being accelerated, and the construction of open-air cranes, boiler rooms, and the surrounding water supply and drainage systems will begin in September.
    Northeast Electric Engineering Plant No. 7 originally had only four production workshops, with outdated machinery and many production processes carried out manually, capable of producing only five or six types of products. After the expansion, the plant will have more than twenty workshops, and most of the production equipment will be equipped with the latest Soviet machinery, with production processes becoming automated or mechanized. A large testing laboratory will also be built within the factory, responsible for researching the performance of conductive and insulating materials for various cables, formulating new insulating materials, studying advanced operating methods, and designing and testing new types of cables. After the completion of the entire expansion project, the production of wires and cables will reach more than twenty-five types, and the output will increase several times compared to the present, equivalent to about two-thirds of the total national wire production.

    Shanghai to Build New Factory for Steel Window Manufacturing
    To undertake the task of supplying steel windows for national capital construction, a new workshop specializing in rolling steel window profiles and a new factory specializing in processing steel window profiles into steel windows will soon begin construction in Shanghai.
    Steel windows are indispensable equipment in new factories and large buildings constructed throughout the country. In the past, Shanghai's steel factories could only produce two common types of steel windows, and the output was very small, far from meeting the needs of construction in various regions. In order to supply the steel window needs of various departments such as heavy industry, machinery industry, fuel industry, and textile industry across the country, the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government has decided to build a new workshop specializing in the production of steel window profiles in the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company No. 2 Plant. This workshop will soon commence construction and is expected to be put into production in April next year. The Ministry of First Machinery Industry of the Central People's Government has also determined to build a new factory for processing and manufacturing steel windows in the Shanghai Steel Window Factory under its jurisdiction. This new factory will commence construction in late September, and the production capacity after completion will be five times greater than the production capacity of the existing factory.
    Steel window profiles are a type of small steel material with particularly complex shapes. One window requires five or six types of steel window profiles to be assembled. After more than a year of research and trial rolling, Shanghai Iron and Steel Company No. 2 Plant successfully trial-rolled one of the most technically complex steel window profiles in late July this year. This provides the necessary technical conditions for the official production of the new steel window workshop. (According to Xinhua News Agency)
    "Dedicate Technology to the Motherland Without Reservation"
    Under the correct leadership of the Tangshan Power Plant Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the technical personnel of the Tangshan Power Plant "dedicate technology to the motherland without reservation." Now, half of the plant's technical personnel have become glorious Communist Party members, and four technical personnel have become labor models of the province, city, and factory. The technical personnel of the Tangshan Power Plant frequently go deep into the workshops, summarize the workers' operating experience, and help the factory formulate and implement various operating procedures and systems. They often work, sacrificing their rest time. During the rapid overhaul last year, engineer Ning Jirong worked every day from 7:00 in the morning to 7:00 in the evening before resting. Boiler engineer Yu Shubin worked until late at night to create an automatic ash removal device. Because the technical personnel and workers are closely united and constantly improving their technical level, it has played a decisive role in the long-term safe operation of the plant.
    In order to unite and transform the technical personnel, the plant's Party committee conducted long-term ideological work. On the one hand, it actively supports correct ideas and promotes the advantages of technical personnel. On the other hand, it also actively and resolutely combats incorrect ideas, helping them overcome shortcomings. The plant's Party committee and administrative leaders respect the technical personnel everywhere to give full play to their enthusiasm, giving them authority and responsibility. Every technical measure in the plant is implemented after the technical personnel have studied it. At the beginning of liberation, the plant often had accidents. The leadership sent them to the most important workshops as directors to rectify the workshop work. At the same time, the leadership also regularly cares about the technical personnel's technical learning, organizing them to visit fraternal factories and learn advanced experiences. In the past four years, eight technicians have been promoted to engineers.

    Tiancheng Railway Earthwork Workers Actively Learn Advanced Experience
    In the past six months, more than 9,000 earthwork workers participating in the construction of the Tiancheng Railway have learned advanced operating methods and have also put forward dozens of suggestions for improving tools and operating methods, which has greatly accelerated the progress of the entire line project.
    At the end of February this year, the Technology Department of the Tiancheng Railway Construction Bureau organized advanced workers and technicians to run training classes along the railway line to give demonstration performances in order to promote the advanced experience that had been summarized. After these advanced experiences were rapidly promoted in various places, the work efficiency of excavating earth and stone was greatly improved. For example, after more than 2,000 rock workers in the fourth engineering section universally promoted the "single-person drilling method," the efficiency of drilling blasting holes increased by 40% to 50%. After the stonemasons in the second engineering section learned the "jumping chisel stone cutting method," the efficiency of quarrying stone increased by more than two times. Many workers also combined specific circumstances to improve and create new work methods suitable for local conditions. For example, in some places in the narrow river construction site, because of the limited conditions, it was not suitable to use large cannons, and it was too wasteful to use small cannons. The local workers created a method of setting off "small large cannons" based on the advanced experience of the "large cannon method," which greatly improved work efficiency.

    Dali Farm Successfully Trial-Grows Superior Wheat Variety
    The Shaanxi State-owned Dali Farm successfully trial-planted a superior wheat variety called "Jinghui No. 30." The characteristics of this variety are: suitable for planting in dry land, with strong cold and drought resistance, does not shed grains when blown by strong winds, has long awns, is not susceptible to bird damage, does not lodge, does not require fertilizer, and has a high yield.
    The results of experiments with "Jinghui No. 30" wheat have proven that its yield is higher than other local wheat varieties. For example, in 1951, the average yield per mu of "No. 302" wheat planted by the farm was 190 jin; the average yield per mu of "No. 52" wheat was 198 jin; and the average yield per mu of "Jinghui No. 30" wheat reached more than 230 jin. This year, the average yield per mu of "Bima No. 1" wheat on the farm was 226.43 jin; the average yield per mu of "Jinghui No. 30" wheat was 327.07 jin. The yield of "Jinghui No. 30" exceeded the yield of "Bima No. 1" wheat by more than 100 jin per mu, and exceeded the yield of wheat planted by local farmers by more than double.
    Now, after research by the Agricultural Department of the Shaanxi Provincial People's Government, it has been decided to promote this wheat variety in farms such as Heyang and in areas and townships such as Chengcheng County.

    Pastoralists in Bailingmiao, Suiyuan Welcome Stud Farm
    The Bailingmiao State-owned Pasture and Stud Farm in the Ulanqab League Autonomous Region of Suiyuan Province is welcomed by the pastoralists. Due to overcoming the conservative thinking of the leadership and improving the feeding and management methods, the breeding rate and survival rate of livestock at the Bailingmiao State-owned Pasture have increased significantly this year. For example, 902 Mongolian ewes and Soviet Tsigai rams were bred using artificial insemination, resulting in 868 Tsigai hybrid lambs, with a conception rate of over 96%. The lambs were fat and healthy, which is very popular with local pastoralists. The Bailingmiao State-owned Pasture has now decided to establish four sheep breeding stations in the three pastoral areas of Bailingmiao and Damao United Banner, planning to cross Tsigai rams with Mongolian sheep. Last year, the State-owned Pasture used Soviet riding thoroughbred stallions and Kabardin stallions to artificially inseminate Mongolian mares, and healthy foals have been born one after another. The four-silver-hoofed foals born from the crossbreeding of Soviet riding thoroughbred stallions and Mongolian mares are very popular with local pastoralists. Pastoralists living hundreds of miles away from the pasture also ride their horses to the pasture to visit and request the pasture to send Soviet stallions to breed with their mares.

    在祖国经济建设的战线上
    东北电工七厂扩建工程将开工
    我国机械工业建设重点工程之一——东北电工七厂扩建工程就要开工。这个工厂扩建完工后，将成为我国规模最大的近代化电缆厂。
    在开工日期快到的时候，各项准备工作更加紧张起来。现在拆除工作正加紧进行，露天吊车、锅炉房、场房周围上下水道等项建设工程，九月里就可施工。
    东北电工七厂原来只有四个生产车间，机械设备陈旧，很多生产过程是以手工方式进行，只能生产五、六种产品。经过扩建后，这个厂将增加到二十多个车间，绝大部分的生产设备都要用苏联的最新式的机器装备起来，生产过程都将自动化或机械化。在这个工厂里并要建设起一座大型的试验所，这个试验所将担负研究各种电缆的导电和绝缘材料的性能，制定新型的绝缘材料，研究先进的操作方法，设计和试验新型的电缆。扩建工程全部完成后，生产的电线和电缆将达二十五种以上，产量将比现在提高数倍，相当于全国电线总产量的三分之二左右。    （据新华社讯）
    上海将兴建制造钢窗的新工厂
    为担负起供应全国基本建设的钢窗的任务，一个专门轧制钢窗料的新车间，和一个专门把钢窗料加工制成钢窗的新工厂，很快就要在上海动工兴建。
    钢窗是各地建设的新工厂、大型建筑物中不可缺少的设备。上海的钢铁工厂，过去只能生产两种普通型式的钢窗，而且产量很少，远远不能满足各地建设的需要。为了供应各地重工业，机械工业、燃料工业、纺织工业等部门的钢窗的需要，中央人民政府重工业部决定在上海钢铁公司第二厂新建一个专门生产钢窗料的车间。这个车间不久就要动工，预计明年四月可以投入生产。中央人民政府第一机械工业部也确定在所属的上海钢窗厂建筑一个加工制造钢窗的新工厂。这个新工厂九月下旬就可动工，建成后的生产能力将比现有工厂的生产能力大五倍。
    钢窗料属于型式特别复杂的小型钢材，一扇窗需要五、六种式样的钢窗料配成。上海钢铁公司第二厂经过一年多以来的研究和试轧，在今年七月下旬试轧成功了其中一种技术上最复杂的钢窗料。这就为新建钢窗车间的正式生产，准备了必要的技术条件。    （据新华社讯）
    “将技术毫不保留地献给祖国”
    唐山发电厂的技术人员们在中国共产党唐山发电厂党委的正确领导下，“将技术毫不保留地献给祖国”，现在该厂已有一半技术人员成了光荣的共产党员，并有四个技术人员成为省、市、厂的劳动模范。唐山发电厂的技术人员们经常深入车间，总结工人操作的经验，帮助工厂制定和执行各种操作规程制度，他们常常不惜牺牲休息时间进行工作。去年厂内快速检修时，工程师宁技荣每天从早晨七点钟工作到晚上七点钟才休息。锅炉工程师于树彬为了创造自动出灰装置，每天工作到深夜。由于技术人员和工人们紧紧地团结在一起不断提高技术水平，对该厂长期地安全运转起了决定作用。
    该厂的党委为了团结和改造技术人员，曾进行了长期的思想工作。一方面积极支持正确思想，发扬技术人员的优点，另一方面，也积极和不正确的思想进行坚决斗争，帮助他们克服缺点。该厂党委和行政领导上为了发挥技术人员的积极性，处处都很尊重他们，使他们有职有权，厂内每一项技术措施都经过技术人员研究以后才实行。解放初期，该厂经常出事故，领导上把他们派到最重要的车间当主任，整顿车间工作。同时，领导上还经常关心技术人员的技术学习，组织他们去兄弟厂参观，学习先进经验。四年来，有八名技术员提升为工程师。

    天成铁路土石方工人积极学习先进经验
    参加修筑天成铁路的土石方工人，半年来有九千多人学会了先进操作方法，还提出了几十件改进工具和操作方法的建议，使得全线工程的进展大大加快。
    今年二月底，天成铁路施工局技术处曾经组织先进工人和技术员到铁路沿线开办训练班，作示范表演，以推广已经总结出来的先进经验。这些先进经验在各地迅速推广后，大大提高了开掘土石方的工作效率。如第四工程段两千多个石方工人普遍推广“单人打眼法”后，打炮眼效率提高了百分之四十到五十。第二工程段的石工学习“跳锲截石法”后，开石料的效率提高了两倍以上。许多工人还结合具体情况，改进和创造了适合本地情况的新的工作法。如在窄狭河工地的有些地方，因限于条件，放大炮不适合，放小炮又太浪费人工，当地的工人就根据“放大炮法”的先进经验，创造了一种放“小大炮”的方法，使得工作效率大大提高。

    大荔农场试种优良麦种成功
    陕西国营大荔农场试种了一种优良小麦品种，该小麦名为“泾惠三十号”。这种品种的特性是：适宜在旱地种植，抗寒抗旱性较强，受大风吹而不落粒，麦芒长，不受小鸟侵食，不倒伏，不费肥料，产量高。
    “泾惠三十号”小麦经试验结果，证明比当地别的小麦产量都高。例如：一九五一年农场播种的“三○二号”小麦，每亩平均产量是一百九十斤；“五二号”小麦每亩平均产量是一百九十八斤；“泾惠三十号”小麦每亩平均产量则达到二百三十斤以上。今年农场“碧蚂一号”小麦每亩平均产量是二百二十六点四三斤；“泾惠三十号”小麦每亩平均产量是三百二十七点零七斤。“泾惠三十号”超过“碧蚂一号”小麦产量每亩一百斤以上，超过当地农民播种的小麦产量一倍以上。
    现在，这种麦种经过陕西省人民政府农业厅研究以后，决定在郃阳等农场和澄城县等区乡推广。
