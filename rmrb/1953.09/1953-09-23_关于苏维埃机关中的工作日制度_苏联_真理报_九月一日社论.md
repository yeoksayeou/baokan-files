The state organs of the Soviet state play a significant role in accomplishing the great tasks of communist construction. The Soviet state organs are the most democratic and truly people's administrative organs in the world. Its strength lies in its close ties with the broadest working masses and its reliance on their creative initiative, and in the fact that all activities of its cadres follow the policies formulated by the Communist Party, which embody the vital interests of the people.

The Communist Party and the Soviet government constantly care for the consolidation of state organs and the improvement of their working methods, and demand that Soviet organs always be able to undertake the tasks placed before them, that all links of the organs work accurately and effectively, and that the staff of state organs loyally serve the people.

The founder of the Soviet state, the great Lenin, said to the leaders of the central Soviet organs in 1921: "The Soviet administrative organs should work accurately, practically, and rapidly. Because of its slackness, not only the interests of individuals are affected, but the entire cause of the administrative organs will have a fictitious and illusory nature. … I request that in the future, the matters and requests submitted to you be answered as quickly and comprehensively as possible. Confining oneself to some empty correspondence with other organs is to foster procrastination and waste paper."

Lenin's high demands on the staff of Soviet organs, established as early as the initial years of the Soviet regime, still have practical significance today. The Soviet state organs now possess a wealth of experience in socialist construction, and working within them are cadres cultivated by the Party who are highly skilled in their work and loyal to the cause of communism, and who are able to smoothly implement the directives of the Party and the government. Despite all of the above, serious shortcomings still exist in the activities of Soviet organs.

One of the biggest shortcomings in many central and local Soviet organs is the violation of the normal working day system, which adversely affects the entire activity of Soviet organs.

The recent resolution of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union on the working day system of various ministries, administrations, and other Soviet organs sharply criticized the incorrect practices in the work of the organs, that is, the blatant violation of the laws of the working day system. It has been found that the leaders of various ministries, administrations, and other organs often start work two to three hours late and end the working day late into the night. Some staff members are unnecessarily kept at their posts, and they are asked to do work outside of the prescribed hours. Because the working hours are arranged so abnormally in many ministries and administrations, and the leaders personally violate the existing system, the work of the organs is not adequately supervised, and the labor discipline of the staff is undermined.

Many facts prove that wherever there are such bad practices in work, they are mostly lagging behind in completing plans and production tasks, and there are also serious shortcomings in the leadership of enterprises.

Take the Ministry of Timber and Paper Industry as an example. At first glance, it seems that its leaders work a lot and very diligently, sparing no effort and disregarding time. But what is the actual situation of the work? It is precisely because of their mistakes that the work of the entire department of this ministry is poorly organized. The rule of the ministry leaders is to start the working day two to three hours late, then, after working for a few hours, a long lunch break, and then endless meetings in the evening.

This procedure (or rather, disorder!) in the work of the ministry leaders complicates the entire activity of the organs. The staff of sections and divisions, and many visitors, cannot resolve the most important and urgent issues within the scope of the authority of the minister, deputy ministers, members of the ministry board, and division chiefs in the morning, because the leaders of the organs are not in the ministry in the morning. This disrupts the organization of the work of the organs, weakens the labor discipline of the staff, and unintentionally teaches them not to be so hasty in starting the working day, but to "saunter in." However, in the second half of the working day, the leaders of the ministry and administrations arbitrarily postpone it to the evening, and thus, there is unnecessary rushing and crash work in the work of the staff of the organs. The offices of the leaders often have rows of staff and visitors waiting to resolve urgent matters.

Bad working practices are also manifested in the evening meetings of the ministry board. The committee meetings held in this situation are rarely beneficial to things, sometimes they become empty chatter. Many draft resolutions submitted to the committee for review are prepared in a hurry, so that they need to be "revised" in special committees for a long time later. These facts prove that the leaders of the relevant units and sections have not fulfilled their basic responsibilities in preparing serious drafts and familiarizing themselves with business proposals. Obviously, the incorrect practices of the leaders of the ministry and the work of various units have had to affect the activities of the enterprises of the Ministry of Timber and Paper Industry.

The Ministry of Maritime and Inland Navigation and many other ministries, administrations and units have similar shortcomings. Disrupting the working system of organs will bring serious damage to the cause, generate procrastination and bureaucracy, and hinder the resolution of many truly urgent and vital issues. It is completely intolerable that the same shortcomings have spread to the Party organs.

In improving the work of state organs, the Party and the government have shown great concern for the cadres of Soviet organs, who, together with the entire people, loyally and selflessly labor for our socialist motherland. Due to the abnormal organization of working hours and the destruction of the existing system by leaders, the staff of the organs loses time to improve their cultural and political level and professional proficiency, and at the same time cannot give due attention to family and the education of children. It is known that working in the evening has a bad effect on the health of the staff and reduces their ability to work. These abnormal phenomena, which have been resolutely condemned by the Party and the government, should be eradicated.

In order to rectify the working day system and consolidate the labor discipline of various ministries, administrations, and other Soviet organs, a firm working day procedure is being established in accordance with the government's resolution.

From September 1, 1953, in the all-union and republic organs and organizations in Moscow, it is stipulated that work starts at 9:00 am and ends at 6:00 pm, with a one-hour lunch break. In the local organs and organizations, it is stipulated that work starts at 10:00 am and ends at 7:00 pm, with a one-hour lunch break.

The government's resolution on the working day system of various ministries, administrations, and other Soviet organs has great national significance. The implementation of this decision makes it extremely possible to improve the activities of state organs and makes them work more accurately. This measure of the government is filled with care for the Soviet people—the staff of state organs. The strict implementation of the working day system of Soviet organs creates better conditions for many of its cadres: there will be more adequate time to improve the cultural and political level and professional proficiency. At the same time, the staff of state organs will have more opportunities to care for family and educate children.

In front of the leaders of various ministries, administrations, and all Soviet organs, local Party organizations, lies the task of insisting on implementing this important national measure, the task of further consolidating the national discipline of all links of the Soviet organs, and improving the labor skills of Soviet staff. The glorious cause of the staff of Soviet organs is to use every hour and every minute of the working day to accomplish the tasks of the country in their own positions. We must launch a resolute battle against all manifestations of bureaucracy and procrastination, strengthen the supervision and inspection of implementation, and vigorously promote self-criticism, especially criticism from below.

Ministers, leaders of administrations, and other organs are responsible for strictly abiding by the prescribed working day system, absolutely prohibiting calling staff to work at unauthorized hours and extending the working day in organs and organizations. In cases where it is extremely necessary to call staff to work at unauthorized hours, the organs must ensure that additional compensation is paid for extra work according to the current legislation with the standard working day rate, but the wage fund must not be overspent as a result.

In accordance with the government's decision on the working day system, ministers and leaders of central organs must change the rules of internal working procedures. The Councils of Ministers of various union republics should also rectify the working day system in the republic and local organs.

The implementation of the government's resolution on the working day system in Soviet organs will further consolidate state organs and enhance its role in the struggle to achieve the tasks of communist construction. (Translated by Hu Sisheng)

    关于苏维埃机关中的工作日制度
    ——苏联“真理报”九月一日社论
    苏维埃国家的国家机关在完成共产主义建设的伟大任务中起着重大的作用。苏维埃国家机关是世界上最民主的、真正人民的管理机关。它的力量在于它和最广大的劳动群众有紧密的联系并依靠他们的创造积极性，在于它的干部的全部活动都遵循着共产党制订的体现人民切身利益的政策。
    共产党和苏维埃政府经常关怀国家机关的巩固和它的工作方法的改善，并要求苏维埃机关永远能担负起摆在它面前的任务，要求机关的各个环节准确和有效地工作，要求国家机关的工作人员忠诚地为人民服务。
    苏维埃国家的创始人、伟大的列宁一九二一年对中央苏维埃机关的领导人说道：“苏维埃行政机关应该准确地、实在地和迅速地工作。由于它的松弛，不仅影响个人的利益，而且使管理机关的全部事业会具有虚构的、虚幻的性质。……我要求今后最快地和详尽地回答送交给你们的事情和要求。局限于一些给其他机关的空洞的来往文件，也就是使拖沓作风滋长和浪费纸张。”
    列宁早在苏维埃政权的最初年代就订下的对苏维埃机关工作人员的高度要求，在现在的日子里仍有现实的意义。苏维埃国家机关现在拥有社会主义建设的极丰富的经验，在里面工作的是党培养的对业务高度熟练的和对共产主义事业忠诚的干部，他们能够顺利地贯彻党和政府的指令。虽然有上述一切，苏维埃机关的活动中仍存在着严重的缺点。
    许多中央的和地方的苏维埃机关的最大缺点之一就是破坏正常的工作日制度，因而恶劣地影响到苏维埃机关的全部活动。
    苏联部长会议最近通过的关于各部、各主管机关和其他苏维埃机关工作日制度的决议中，对机关工作的不正确做法，即对工作日制度的法令的粗暴破坏，提出了尖锐的批评。据查明，各部、各主管机关和其他机关的领导人员常常迟二——三小时开始上班工作，而到深夜才结束一天的工作日。不必要地把一部分工作人员扣留在工作岗位上，叫他们在非规定的时间内做工作。由于许多部和主管机关中工作时间安排得这样不正常和领导人员亲自破坏现存的制度，机关的工作就没有充分的监督，工作人员的劳动纪律受到损害。
    很多的事实证明，凡是工作中有这种恶劣作风的地方，在完成计划和生产任务方面多半是落后的，对企业的领导中也大多有严重的缺点。
    拿木材和造纸工业部来举例。骤然看来，似乎它的领导人员工作得很多并且很勤劳，既不吝惜精力又不估计时间。但工作的实际情形如何呢，正因为他们的过错使得这个部的整个部门的工作组织得不好。部的领导人员的规则是，迟二——三小时才开始工作日，然后，工作几小时之后，长时间的午饭的间歇时间，然后是晚间的无休止的会议。
    部领导人员在工作中的这种程序（更正确地说是没有秩序！）使得机关的全部活动复杂化。科和处的工作人员，许多访问者不能在上午解决在部长、副部长、部务委员和处长职权范围内，最重要的和急迫的问题，因为机关领导人员早上不在部里。这就破坏了机关的工作组织，削弱了工作人员的劳动纪律，无意地教导他们开始工作日不必那么急忙，而可以“姗姗而来”。但是工作日的下半天，部和主管机关的领导人又随意把它推迟到晚上，于是机关工作人员的工作中就出现无谓的奔忙和突击的现象。领导人员的办公室里就经常出现等待解决紧急事务的工作人员和来访者的行列。
    恶劣的工作作风也表现在部务委员会的晚间会议上。在这种情况下举行的委员会会议对事情很少有好处，有时就变成空洞无物的清谈了。许多提交委员会审议的决议草案是匆忙准备的，以致后来需要再在专门委员会作长时期的“补充修改”。这些事实证明，有关单位和科的领导人在准备认真的草案和熟悉业务的提案方面没有完成它基本的职责。很显然，部的领导人员和各单位工作的不正确作风不得不影响到木材与造纸工业部各企业的活动。
    海上和内河航运部以及其他许多部、主管机关和单位也有类似的缺点。破坏机关的工作制度会给事业带来严重的损害，产生拖沓现象和官僚主义，阻碍许多真正刻不容缓的、极关重要问题的解决。完全不能容忍的是，相同的缺点已扩展到党的机关中去了。
    在改善国家机关的工作时，党和政府对苏维埃机关的干部表现出极大的关怀，这些干部和全体人民一起为我们社会主义祖国而忠诚地、忘我地劳动。由于不正常地组织工作时间和机关领导人员破坏现存制度，机关工作人员就失去了提高文化、政治水平和业务熟练程度的时间，同时也就不能对家庭和教育孩子给以应有的注意。大家知道，在晚上工作对工作人员的健康有不好的影响并减低他们的劳动能力。这些受到党和政府的坚决斥责的不正常的现象，应当根除。
    为了整顿工作日制度和巩固各部、各主管机关以及其他苏维埃机关的劳动纪律，坚定的工作日程序正在按照政府的决议而建立起来。
    自一九五三年九月一日起，在莫斯科的全联盟的和共和国的机关和组织，规定上午九时开始工作到下午六时结束工作，并有一小时的午饭时间。各地方机关和组织，规定上午十时开始工作到下午七时结束工作，并有一小时午饭时间。
    政府关于各部、各主管机关以及其他苏维埃机关工作日制度的决议具有巨大的国家意义。这个决定的贯彻使国家机关的活动的改善有极大的可能，并使它工作得更准确。政府的这个措施充满了对苏维埃人—国家机关工作人员的关怀。苏维埃机关工作日的严格制度的贯彻，对它的许多干部创造了更良好的条件：将有更充分的时间提高文化和政治水平以及业务熟练程度。同时，国家机关工作人员将有更加关怀家庭和教育孩子的可能。
    在各部、各主管机关以及所有苏维埃机关、地方党组织的领导人面前，摆着坚持贯彻这个重要的国家措施的任务，摆着进一步巩固苏维埃机关各环节的国家纪律和提高苏维埃职员的劳动技巧的任务。苏维埃机关工作人员的光荣事业—在自己的工作岗位上把劳动日的每小时、每分钟用来完成国家的任务。必须向官僚主义和拖沓作风的各种表现展开坚决的战斗，加强对执行情况的监督和检查，大力展开自我批评，特别是自下而上的批评。
    部长、主管机关和其他机关的领导人有责任严格地遵守规定的工作日制度，绝对禁止在非规定时间召集工作人员去工作并在机关和组织里延长工作日。在那种召集工作人员在非规定时间内工作是极端必要的情况下，机关要保证按照现行立法以定额的工作日标准支付额外工作的附加报酬，但不得因此超额开支工资基金。
    按照政府关于工作日制度的决定，中央机关的部长和领导人必须改变内部工作程序的规则。各加盟共和国部长会议也应该在共和国的和地方的机关整顿工作日制度。
    在苏维埃机关贯彻政府关于工作日制度的决议，将进一步巩固国家机关，增强它在争取实现共产主义建设的任务中的作用。（胡思升译）
