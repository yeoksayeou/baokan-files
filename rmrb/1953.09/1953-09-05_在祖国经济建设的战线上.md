    On the Frontlines of the Motherland's Economic Construction
    Minsheng Company's Minxie and Kuixia Vessels Successfully Trial "Push Towing Method"
    The jointly owned public-private Minsheng Company's Minxie and Kuixia vessels successfully trialed the Soviet inland river navigation advanced experience "push towing method" in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River in July and August of this year.
    The Yangtze River's upstream section, the Sichuan River, is 1,084 kilometers long (from Yichang, Hubei to Yibin, Sichuan). The Sichuan River's channel is narrow and winding, with many dangerous shoals, and the current is swift, making it very difficult for ships to tow barges upstream. In the past, single-ship side towing was used, which increased the ship's resistance, resulting in slow sailing speed and the inability to carry heavy loads or tow multiple barges. Later, the Soviet single-line towing method was promoted on the Sichuan River, which solved the problem of downstream towing, but upstream navigation faced many natural limitations. For example, ships couldn't navigate back currents upstream, and barges hanging at the stern when navigating shoals made maneuvering difficult, hindering the ability to yield to other vessels. Therefore, it was not possible to widely promote this method.
    In July of this year, the Soviet inland river navigation advanced experience "push towing method" was introduced to the Sichuan River. The Party, administrative, and trade union leaders of Minsheng Company immediately organized study and research. They decided to select the Minxie vessel for trial operation from Chongqing to Luxian on July 19, followed by the Kuixia vessel from Yichang to Chongqing on August 1.
    The "push towing method" is the opposite of the "single-line towing method." The barge fleet is tied into an arrowhead shape, placing the barges in front of the ship (three or five are possible), with the ship sandwiched in the middle pushing the barges forward. Because the connection is convenient, the ship and barges become a single unit, allowing for free maneuvering, unrestricted by water level, enabling navigation in back currents, the ability to yield to other vessels, and convenient stopping and anchoring. This has improved shipping speed, increased transport volume, and reduced shipping costs. During the Minxie vessel's trial, upstream load increased by 45% compared to the past, and downstream load doubled. When the Kuixia vessel passed the Fox Shoal in Wanxian upstream, it towed three iron barges with a water level of 7.6 zhang, yet it only took 10 minutes. Previously, towing two barges at a lower water level took 17 minutes. Relevant departments are now using the trial experience to prepare for the full-line promotion of the advanced Soviet "push towing method" on the Sichuan River. (Our Southwest Correspondent Station)
    Hulan and Acheng to Build Two of the Largest Flax Processing Plants in the Country
    Hulan and Acheng, near Harbin, are building two of China's largest flax processing plants: the state-owned Hulan Flax Processing Plant and the state-owned Acheng Flax Processing Plant. According to their design capacity, their annual output will be equal to the total annual output of the seven existing flax processing plants in Northeast China. Construction of the two plants began in July of this year and is scheduled to be completed in the second half of next year. Their main task after completion will be to produce raw materials for China's large-scale Harbin Flax Textile Mill.
    China's existing flax processing plants are mostly semi-handicraft operations, far from meeting the needs of the new Harbin Flax Textile Mill. The two new flax processing plants are being built with the help of advanced Soviet technology. They will be equipped with the latest Soviet-style combined flax processing machines, which will automate the entire production process from flax selection, retting, stem drying, and breaking to baling. Production efficiency will be very high. The annual output of just one combined flax processing machine will be 80% higher than that of an old flax processing plant, and the flax yield will increase by about 30%, with good flax quality.

    Coal Deposits Found in the Weihe River Coalfield Suitable for Mining
    Geological drilling work is being carried out on a large scale in the Weihe River Coalfield in Shaanxi Province. In the past eight months, many coal deposits suitable for mining have been found in an area of 12 square kilometers. In most boreholes, three or four coal seams have been found, with the average coal seam being one or two meters thick. The development of the Weihe River Coalfield will be of great significance in solving the coal needs of the increasingly developing industry and transportation in the Northwest region.
    The Weihe River Coalfield is located on the plateau on the north bank of the Weihe River in Guanzhong, near the Xianyang-Tongchuan branch line of the Longhai Railway. The Geological Exploration Team of the Ministry of Geology of the Central People's Government is responsible for the exploration of this coalfield. A general survey began in 1951, and preliminary drilling was carried out in some areas on the edge of the coalfield last August. This year, large-scale drilling began in an area of 12 square kilometers in the eastern part of the coalfield. The workers participating in the drilling are highly enthusiastic, and many new drillers have quickly improved their skills with the help of experienced drillers. In the first quarter of this year, the average core recovery rate of each borehole was only 54%, but now it has reached more than 80%. The coal core recovery rate has reached 100% due to the implementation of the "double core barrel" operation method. (Xinhua News Agency)
    Yanbian Korean Autonomous Region Welcomes a Bumper Harvest
    A bumper autumn harvest is expected in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Region of Jilin Province. It is estimated that the output of the region's main crops, rice, millet, and soybeans, will exceed the original planned output for this year by 7% to 14%. Flax, which has not grown well in recent years, has also had a bumper harvest this year, with a quality one grade higher than that of last year. This year, Korean and other ethnic farmers in the region have paid special attention to improving farming methods and agricultural technology in agricultural production, which is the main reason for the increased harvest. This spring, during the preparatory stage for plowing, both the autonomous region and the counties held training courses focusing on the promotion of new farming methods, and widely publicized new farming methods in districts and villages. They also organized the masses to inspect stubble fields, pointing out to farmers the waste of land and reduced yields caused by "large ridges and sparse seedlings" and "missing seedlings and broken rows," so that farmers knew that if they wanted to produce more grain, they must achieve "equal spacing, full seedlings, and more good fertilizer." In order to implement wide sowing and increase yields, farmers also renovated many old farm tools and manufactured many new farm tools. In addition, farmers in the Yanbian region have also made improvements in fertilization and seed selection. At present, the Korean and other ethnic farmers in the region are looking forward to the fruits of their labor in the year since the establishment of the autonomous region—the soon-to-be-harvested crops—and are all excited. They are seizing the time before the autumn harvest to carry out a manure accumulation campaign, striving to complete the region's task of accumulating 800,000 tons of manure. (Liu Keli)
    Digging Ditches to Drain Waterlogged Areas to Strive for Increased Grain Production
    Farmers in Jilunzhai Township, Jiangji District, Woyang County, Anhui Province, are actively digging and repairing ditches to drain waterlogged areas, creating conditions for increasing grain production in the township.
    Of the more than 14,000 mu of arable land in Jilunzhai Township, more than 12,000 mu are waterlogged, and agricultural production is threatened by inland flooding every year. In the past, farmers in Jilunzhai Township had also dug many ditches, but due to the lack of a unified plan, the drainage ditches had little effect. This year, the township cadres learned about the serious significance of increasing grain production, and based on the township's topography and ditch conditions, they formulated a comprehensive plan for the construction of small-scale farmland water conservancy in the township through village cadre meetings, using the method of calculating engineering, labor, and benefits. The plan called for the repair and excavation of 39 large and small drainage ditches throughout the township, using 740 workdays, which were all completed in ten days. After the completion of the project, all the land in the township can be guaranteed a normal harvest under normal circumstances. Now, the farmers throughout the township have begun to repair and dig ditches. (Xinhua News Agency)

    在祖国经济建设的战线上
    民生公司民协夔峡两轮试行“推船运航法”成功
    公私合营民生公司民协夔峡两轮，今年七、八月先后在川江上游试行苏联内河航运先进经验“推船运航法”获得成功。
    长江上游之川江航程，有一千零八十四公里（从湖北宜昌至四川宜宾）。川江河道狭窄弯曲，滩多险恶，水流湍急，轮船上水拖驳非常困难。过去拖驳采用单船帮拖法，轮船航行阻力增加，不但航行速度慢，而且还不能多载重，多拖驳。后来在川江推广苏联一列式的拖带法后，解决了下水的拖驳问题，但上水航行，因有许多自然条件的限制，如上水不能走洄流，上滩时驳子吊在船尾，驾驶不便，让船不方便等困难，不能普遍推广。
    今年七月间，苏联内河航运先进经验“推船运航法”传播到了川江，民生公司的党、行政和工会领导干部立刻组织学习和研究。并决定选择民协轮，首先于七月十九日从重庆到泸县段试航，接着夔峡轮于八月一日从宜昌到重庆试航。
    “推船运航法”与“一列式拖带法”相反，驳船队绑成箭头形，将驳船放在轮船前面，（三个五个均可），轮船夹在中间推驳船前进。这样由于联系方便、轮驳成一整体，操纵自如，不受水位高低限制，能走洄流水、能自己让船，能自行中途停车，抛锚方便。所以提高了航运速率，增加了运输量，降低了航运成本。“民协轮”试航时，上水载量较过去增加百分之四十五，下水载量增加了一倍。“夔峡轮”上水过万县狐滩时，拖了三只铁驳，水位高达七点六丈，但只用了十分钟，而过去拖二只拖驳，水位比这次低，却用了十七分钟。现在有关方面正根据试航经验，准备把苏联先进“推船运航法”，在川江全线推广。（本报西南记者站）
    呼兰阿城建设两个全国最大的亚麻原料厂
    哈尔滨附近的呼兰、阿城两地，正在建设两座我国最大的亚麻原料厂——国营呼兰亚麻原料厂和国营阿城亚麻原料厂。这两个厂按照设计能力，它们的年产量将等于东北原有七个亚麻原料厂的年产总量。两厂建筑工程已在今年七月开工，预定明年下半年建成，建成之后的主要任务即是为我国规模巨大的哈尔滨亚麻纺织厂生产原料。
    我国现有的亚麻原料厂，大都是半手工业性质远不能满足新型的哈尔滨亚麻纺织厂的需要。新建的两座亚麻原料厂，是在苏联先进技术帮助下着手建设的。厂内将安装苏联最新式的联合制麻机，从选麻、沤麻、干茎、打麻到装包，整个生产过程全部机械化。生产效率很高，只一台联合制麻机的年产量就要比一个旧亚麻原料厂的年产量高百分之八十，出麻率能提高百分之三十左右，麻的质量也很好。    （据新华社讯）渭北煤田找到可开采的煤藏陕西省渭北煤田的地质钻探工作正在大规模地展开。今年八个多月以来，在十二平方公里的地区内已经找到了许多可供开采的煤藏，在大多数钻孔中都发现有三四个煤层，一般的煤层都有一两公尺厚。渭北煤田的开发，对于解决西北地区日益发展的工业和交通的用煤问题将具有重大的意义。
    渭北煤田在关中渭河北岸的高原上，靠近陇海铁路的咸（阳）铜（川）支线。这个煤田由中央人民政府地质部所属的地质勘探队负责勘探。一九五一年就开始普查，去年八月在煤田边缘部分地区进行了初步钻探，今年起在煤田东部十二平方公里地区内开始了大规模的钻探。参加钻探的工人们劳动热情很高，许多新钻工在老钻工的帮助下很快地提高了技术。今年第一季度各钻孔的岩芯采取率平均只有百分之五十四，现在已达到百分之八十以上。煤芯采取率由于实行了“双重岩心管”的操作法，已达到了百分之百。    （新华社）
    延边朝鲜族自治区迎接丰收
    吉林省延边朝鲜族自治区秋季农业生产丰收有望。全区主要作物水稻、谷子、大豆的产量，据估计，能超过今年原来计划的产量百分之七到百分之十四。几年来生长一直不很好的亚麻，今年也已经获得丰收，质量比去年所产亚麻提高一个等级。该区朝鲜族农民及各族农民，今年在农业生产上特别注重改进耕作方法，提高农业技术，这是使收成增加的主要原因。今年春天，在备耕阶段，自治区和县就都开办了以推广新耕作法为主的训练班，并在区、村广泛宣传新耕作法，组织群众到田里查看槎口，向农民指出了因“垄大苗稀”、“缺苗断条”等原因造成地力浪费，产量降低的情况，使农民知道了要想多打粮食，必须做到“等距、全苗、多上好粪”。农民为了实行宽播，提高产量，又改造了许多旧的农具，制造许多新的农具。此外，延边区农民在施肥，选种等方面也有改进。目前，全区朝鲜族和各族农民眼望着他们在自治区成立一年来的劳动成果——即将丰收的庄稼，莫不欢欣鼓舞。他们正抓紧秋收前的时间，开展积肥运动，为完成全区积肥八十万吨的任务而奋斗。（刘克礼）
    挖沟排涝争取粮食增产
    安徽省涡阳县江集区纪伦砦乡农民积极挖修沟渠排除洼地积水，为全乡增产粮食创造条件。
    纪伦砦乡一万四千多亩耕地中，有一万二千多亩是洼地，农业生产年年受着内涝的威胁。往年，纪伦砦乡农民也曾挖了不少沟渠，但因缺乏统一计划，排水沟的作用不大。今年，该乡干部了解到增产粮食的严重意义，就根据全乡的地势和沟洫情况，通过村干部会议，用算工程算劳力算效益的办法，订出了全乡兴修小型农田水利的通盘计划。计划全乡修理和开挖大小排水沟三十九条，用七百四十个工，十天全部完成。工程完成之后，该乡的全部土地在通常的情况下可保证常年的收成。现在，全乡农民已开始修挖沟渠。    （新华社）
