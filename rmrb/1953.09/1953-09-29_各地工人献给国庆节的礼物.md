Kang Yongxiang's Team Exceeds New Production Increase Plan

The Kang Yongxiang Rapid First Brigade of the Fuzitan Coal Mine, led by labor model Kang Yongxiang, originally planned to increase coal production by 150 tons in September. During this production increase and conservation campaign, the workers proposed a new production increase plan as a gift to National Day. They proposed a new plan to increase daily production by ten tons of coal, for a total increase of three hundred tons of coal in September. Under the leadership of labor model Kang Yongxiang, all the workers united as one, improved their operating methods, and strictly implemented safety regulations. As a result, they completed 131.9 percent of the newly set plan in eighteen days. (Fuzitan Mining Area Trade Union)

Dabus Refinery Sets New Record

The Dabus Refinery of the Yumen Mining Bureau set a new record on September 5th by operating for one hundred and ten consecutive days. The refinery's employees unanimously expressed their intention to strive for even higher records to welcome the first National Day after the start of the country's planned economic construction.

In late May, the refinery's employees diligently carried out the overhaul of the refinery furnace. After the restart, they adopted a mixed refining method, which reduced corrosion and coking. At the same time, they promoted the advanced experience of the Wang Kuan team and maintained stable operations, initially achieving balanced production. Thanks to the joint efforts of workers and technicians, many technical difficulties were resolved. To ensure the extension of the operating time, a rotating inspection team was organized in August to strengthen the inspection of the main equipment of each system. When uneven furnace pipe and fire were found during the inspection, they were reported to the foreman or duty director in time for timely adjustment. This also played a significant role in ensuring stable furnace fire and reducing coking.

Beijing Jingxi Mining Bureau Mentougou Electrical and Mechanical Plant Launches Competition

Since the launch of the "All-Red" competition, including safety, quality, quotas, and cost, in August at the Mentougou Electrical and Mechanical Plant of the Beijing Jingxi Mining Bureau, significant results have been achieved. For example, the pipe casting group in the casting workshop, in the past, frequently produced defective products due to inconsistent operating methods and poor communication, with a defect rate that once reached 80 percent. After the launch of the "All-Red" competition, the workers of the pipe casting group proposed many suggestions for improving the casting of iron pipes and unified the operating methods, reducing the defect rate to below 20 percent. Wei Lianming, a worker in the electrical repair workshop, used other materials to modify oil switches, saving the country more than 14 million yuan. Liang Xiuying, a young lathe operator, created a new record of exceeding the quota by 85.7 percent when machining wheel screws.

Now, the production groups of the electrical and mechanical plant have put forward conditions for challenging and responding to challenges one after another, striving to create new production achievements to celebrate National Day.

Ang'angxi Military Grain Processing Plant Employees Find Ways to Improve Production

In order to present a gift for National Day, all the employees of the Ang'angxi Military Grain Processing Plant enthusiastically launched a competition to "find clever ideas" and "complete the overhaul task twenty-four hours ahead of schedule." As soon as the mobilization meeting for "finding clever ideas to give gifts to National Day" was adjourned on September 8, the clever ideas registration office was surrounded by many employees. By the second half of September, a total of 208 clever ideas and rationalization proposals had been received, of which 70 percent were feasible. In the high spirit of all employees welcoming National Day, the mechanical overhaul task was completed forty-two hours ahead of schedule, and the flour production was increased by 31 percent.

Asia Steel Plant Completes Task of Supporting Ma'anshan Iron Mine Ahead of Schedule

Starting from September 1, the state-owned Shanghai Asia Steel Plant continued to manufacture the second batch of mine car wheels to support the Ma'anshan Iron Mine. Although Zou Shengfa, Yang Jingen and other four people in the sand casting workshop created a new record of making seven mine car wheels a day, it was still possible that the task could not be completed.

On September 2, after in-depth discussions, the mold-making group proposed in the Patriotic Pact for September: "Greet National Day with practical actions to break the quota."

In order to implement this guarantee, they arrived at the factory early the next morning to make full preparations, so as not to waste a minute or a second in the entire production time. When they got off work that day, the comrade in charge of daily reports happily said: "You have broken the quota today! You made ten pieces a day." Originally, each piece had a quota of six hours, but now each piece only takes four hours. This not only saved twenty man-hours, but also allowed them to complete the mold-making task by the ninth. This achievement greatly encouraged everyone's enthusiasm. Since then, they have maintained the record of making ten qualified mine car wheel molds every day. Thanks to the early completion of the mold-making task by the mold-making group, coupled with the close cooperation of the mold-baking, casting, sand-cleaning and heat treatment groups, the plant completed the mine car wheel task to support the Ma'anshan Iron Mine ahead of schedule.

    各地工人献给国庆节的礼物
    康永祥队超额完成新的增产计划
    富家滩煤矿南关坑劳动模范康永祥快速第一大队，原计划在九月份增产一百五十吨煤。在这次增产节约竞赛中，工人们提出新的增产计划作为向国庆节献礼。大家提出每日增产十吨煤，九月份共增产三百吨煤的新计划。在劳动模范康永祥的带动下，全队工人团结一致，改进了操作方法，严格执行了安全制度，结果十八天就完成了新订计划的百分之一百三十一点九。（富家滩矿区工会）
    达布斯裂炼厂创造新纪录
    玉门矿务局达布斯裂炼厂，于九月五日创造了开炼一百零十天的最高纪录。该厂职工一致表示：争取创造更高的纪录，以迎接祖国有计划的经济建设开始后的第一个国庆节。
    五月下旬，该厂职工认真地进行了炼炉检修工作，开炼后，采用了混合炼的办法，减少了腐蚀和结焦。同时，推广了王宽班先进经验，保持操作平稳，初步做到了均衡生产。由于工人和技术人员的共同努力，许多技术上的困难问题都解决了。为了保证延长开炼时间，八月份还组织了轮班检查组，加强对各系统主要设备的检查工作。检查中发现炼炉炉管及炉火不均匀时，及时汇报领班或值班主任，及时进行调节，这对保证炉火平稳，减少结焦，也起了极大作用。
    京西矿务局门头沟机电厂开展竞赛
    北京京西矿务局门头沟机电厂从八月份起开展包括安全、质量、定额、成本等四项指标的满堂红竞赛以来，已取得显著成绩。如铸工车间铸管组在铸造铁管时，过去由于操作方法不统一，相互之间的联系差，经常出废品，废品率曾到过百分之八十；满堂红竞赛开展后，铸管组的工人提出很多改进铸造铁管的建议，统一了操作方法，使废品率降低到百分之二十以下。电修车间工人魏廉明利用其他材料改做油开关，给国家节约了一千四百多万元。青年镟工梁秀英在车制车轮螺丝时，创造了超额百分之八十五点七的新纪录。
    现在机电厂各生产小组纷纷提出了挑战应战条件，争取创造新的生产成绩向国庆节献礼。

    昂昂溪军粮加工厂职工找窍门改进生产
    昂昂溪军粮加工厂全体职工为了给国庆节献礼，热烈地展开了“找窍门”和“提前二十四小时完成检修任务”的竞赛。九月八日，“找窍门给国庆节献礼”的动员大会刚一散，窍门登记处就被许多职工围起来了。到了九月下半个月，已收到窍门和合理化建议共二百零八件，其中有百分之七十都是能够实现的。在全体职工迎接国庆的高涨情绪下，提前四十二小时完成机械大检修的任务，并使面粉产量提高了百分之三十一。（王柏祥）
    亚细亚钢铁厂提前完成支援马鞍山铁矿厂的任务
    国营上海亚细亚钢铁厂九月一日起，继续制造第二批矿车轮，支援马鞍山铁矿厂。翻砂车间邹生发、杨金根等四人，虽然创造了一天做七只矿车轮的新纪录，但任务仍有完不成的可能。
    九月二日，制模小组经深入讨论后，在九月份的爱国公约中提出：“以突破定额的实际行动迎接国庆节”。
    为了实行这项保证，第二天他们一清早就到厂里作好充分准备，不使在整个生产时间中浪费一分一秒钟。当天下班时，记日报的同志高兴地说：“今天你们突破定额啦！一天做了十只。”原来每只定额是六小时，现在每只只需四小时，这样不仅节省了二十个工时，而且到九日就可以完成制造模型的任务了。这一个成绩大大鼓舞了大家的热情。从此，每天都保持制造十只合乎规格的矿车轮型的纪录。由于制模小组提前完成了制模任务，加上烘模、浇铸、清砂热处理等小组的紧密配合，该厂提早完成了支援马鞍山铁矿厂的矿车轮任务。
