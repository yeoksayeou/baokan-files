Methods for Controlling Wireworms with "666" Insecticide
Central People's Government Ministry of Agriculture Plant Protection Division

Wireworms are pests that harm seedlings of wheat, millet, sorghum, corn, beans, sweet potatoes, and other crops, with the most severe damage occurring to wheat. In Zuojia溝, Hongtong County, Shanxi Province, hundreds of acres of wheat fields have yielded no harvest for three years due to wireworm infestation. This year, approximately 300,000 acres of wheat fields in Taian and other areas of Shandong Province have also been affected.

In the past, there were no effective methods for controlling wireworms. In 1950, the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute began using "666" to control them. After three years of testing, it was proven to be an effective insecticide for controlling wireworms. In the autumn of 1952 and the spring of this year, the Central Ministry of Agriculture also conducted key experiments on a total of more than 43,000 mu of land in Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Suiyuan, Ningxia, and suburban Beijing, where wireworm damage was severe. In addition, Suiyuan Province independently promoted demonstration fields for control on approximately 600,000 mu. In these areas, either medicated grains were used, or seeds were treated with insecticide powder. After sowing, with the exception of a few areas where drug damage occurred due to lack of experience, poor mastery of seed treatment techniques, inaccurate dosage, and failure to conduct germination tests, most areas achieved significant control effects, and the seedlings of winter wheat and spring wheat grew well.

For example, in Xia County, Shanxi Province, more than 9,400 mu of wheat were sown in 1952 using the seed treatment method. Field inspections in the autumn of that year and the spring of this year proved that although the emergence of the treated wheat was half a day to two days later, the emergence was extremely uniform, with a germination rate of nearly 100%. Moreover, tillering increased a few days after emergence, and development was vigorous. In Han Wutong Village, the wheat planted by Fan Mandou did not experience any seedling death in the fields where the seeds were treated, while in the untreated wheat fields, an average of about 79 damaged seedlings per square meter were found.

In Fan County, Taian County, and other counties in Shandong Province, the promotion of "666" medicated grains was also effective in controlling wireworms, mole crickets, and grubs. After planting wheat with medicated grains, Ding Fuzeng and Tian Yongfa of Tianlaozhuang in Fan County found dead grubs during the evening of the same day. Two days later, most of the wireworms were found to have been poisoned and died. The Xuzhuang and Dongyuzhuang farms in the county have continuously used "666" medicated grains for two years. This year, their more than 80 mu of wheat were basically not harmed by underground insects, but in the wheat fields surrounding the farm where no insecticide was used, the phenomenon of missing seedlings was very common, with the most severe cases reaching 70%.

Although the methods of using "666" medicated grains and "666" seed treatment to control wireworms are already welcomed by the masses, the following points should still be noted in future promotions:

(1) Currently, the main method for controlling wireworms should be "666" medicated grains, because medicated grains are safer and can also control mole crickets and grubs. In areas where wireworms and mole crickets are both severe, it should be vigorously promoted.

The mixing ratio of medicated grains is generally 2 jin of 6% "666" powder (i.e., the previously used 6.5% "666" powder) mixed with 100 jin of boiled grains. However, in areas where mole crickets are particularly severe, the amount of insecticide powder can be increased appropriately. When using medicated grains, attention should be paid to boiling the grains until they are half-cooked. After撈出， allow to cool to half-dry, then mix with the insecticide. Medicated grains should be slightly dried before use, and mixed with wheat seeds for sowing only when they are dry enough to not stick together. Use 3 to 4 jin of medicated grains per mu. Wheat seeds that have been soaked in warm water must be dried before mixing with medicated grains. At the same time, medicated grains and wheat seeds should be mixed and sown on the same day, without delay.

(2) Although the method of directly treating seeds with "666" powder is simple and inexpensive (saving 3 to 4 jin of grains per mu compared to using medicated grains), it requires mastering relatively high technology, otherwise drug damage may occur, affecting emergence. Therefore, in order to avoid losses, the method of directly treating seeds with "666" powder may not be promoted among farmers for the time being.

    用“六六六”药剂防治金针虫的方法
    中央人民政府农业部植物保护司
    金针虫是一种为害小麦、谷子、高粱、玉米及豆类甘薯等作物幼苗的害虫，尤以对小麦的为害最为严重。山西省洪洞县左家沟数百亩麦地，因金针虫的为害已三年没有收成；山东省泰安等地今年受害麦田也有三十万亩。
    过去对金针虫一直没有有效的防治办法。一九五○年华北农业科学研究所开始用“六六六”除治它，经过三年的试验，证明这是防治金针虫的有效药剂。中央农业部一九五二年秋季和今年春季，在金针虫为害严重的山东、山西、河南、绥远、宁夏和北京市郊区等地，也在总数四万三千多亩的田地上进行了重点实验，此外绥远省还自行推广除治示范田约六十万亩。这些地区或用药粉做成毒谷，或用药粉拌种，播种之后，除个别地区由于缺乏经验，对拌种技术掌握较差、用药量不准和没有经发芽试验等原因致发生药害外，绝大部分地区都收到显著的除治效果，冬麦和春麦的幼苗都生长良好。
    如山西省夏县，一九五二年用拌种方法示范播种的九千四百余亩小麦，经过当年秋季和今年春季的田间检查，证明拌药的小麦虽出苗晚了半天到两天，但出苗极为整齐，发芽率近百分之百。并且出苗后数天分蘖增加，发育旺盛。韩五同村樊满斗种的小麦，凡种籽拌药的田里都没有死苗，而没有拌药的麦田平均每平方公尺约有被害苗七十九株。
    山东省范县、泰安等县推广“六六六”毒谷，对防治金针虫、蝼蛄及蛴螬也都有效。范县田老庄丁福曾和田永发等户，用毒谷伴随小麦播种后，当天晚上检查就发现有被毒死的蛴螬，两天后再检查，大部金针虫都中毒死亡；该县徐庄和东于庄农场两年来连续使用“六六六”毒谷，今年八十多亩小麦基本上没有遭受地下虫的为害，但农场周围没有使用药剂的麦田，缺苗现象则很普遍，缺苗最多的达百分之七十。
    用“六六六”毒谷和用“六六六”拌种防治金针虫的方法，虽然已经是群众欢迎的方法，但在今后推广中还应该注意下列几点：
    （一）目前防治金针虫应以“六六六”毒谷为主要方法，因为毒谷较为安全，同时还能兼治蝼蛄、蛴螬。金针虫和蝼蛄都很严重的地区，应当大力推广。
    毒谷的配合量，一般可用百分之六的“六六六”粉（即以前所用的百分之六点五的“六六六”粉）二市斤，拌煮过的谷子一百斤。但在蝼蛄特别严重的地区可酌量增加药粉的用量。使用毒谷时应注意要把谷子煮成半熟。捞出晾至半干后再拌药。毒谷用前须稍晒，等干到互不粘结时才能混合麦种播种。每亩地用毒谷三市斤到四市斤。经过温汤浸种的麦种，须晾干后再和毒谷混合。同时毒谷和麦种混合后，应在当天播种，不要拖延。
    （二）用“六六六”粉直接拌种的方法，虽然手续简便，成本低廉（比用毒谷每亩节省谷子三、四斤）但要求掌握比较高的技术，否则可能发生药害，影响出苗。因此，为了避免损失，用“六六六”粉直接拌种的方法在农民中间可暂不推广。
