　　Henan Xuchang Special District Tobacco Leaves Listed
　　State-Owned Trade Departments and Cooperatives Vigorously Purchase

　　Henan Xuchang Special District's tobacco leaves have begun to be listed on the market, and state-owned trade departments and cooperatives have actively organized sources of goods to cooperate with the tobacco leaf purchase work.

　　Henan Xuchang Special District is a famous tobacco producing area in the country. This year, the planting area of the entire special district increased by 12.41 percent compared with last year. Although it suffered from wind, frost, and insect pests this spring, thanks to the support of the People's Government, tobacco farmers improved tobacco field management, paid attention to deep plowing and meticulous cultivation, and overcame natural disasters. The spring tobacco still achieved a bumper harvest, and a bumper harvest of late tobacco is in sight. According to a key survey by the Special District Finance Committee, the total tobacco production in the district can increase by 28.47 percent compared with last year. Now the new tobacco has begun to be listed on the market. In mid-August, the amount of tobacco leaves listed on the market in Xuchang alone reached more than 300,000 catties per day. The China Tobacco and Jute Company Henan Provincial Company and local cooperatives and state-owned trade departments have actively started purchasing.

　　In order to cooperate with the tobacco leaf purchase, the China Coal Construction Company Xuchang City Company transferred a large amount of coal from Fengfeng, Jiaozuo, Guanyintang and other coal mines, and planned to distribute it to Xuchang, Linying, Heshanqiao and other business offices to supply tobacco farmers with coal for curing tobacco, and established coal supply relationships for curing tobacco with cooperatives in Xiangcheng County, Linying and other places. By the end of July, tobacco farmers in various places had begun to transport coal. In Xuchang alone, 30,000 tons of coal were sold in July. In August, it can sell 1,800 tons per day. Xuchang Local State-Owned Trading Company also purchased 450,000 catties of small mao bamboo poles and more than 700,000 catties of raw and cooked iron from Hunan and Guangxi for curing tobacco, and supplied them to tobacco farmers in large quantities. In order to cooperate with the purchase of tobacco leaves, the Special District Cooperative has purchased back production materials such as sesame cakes, bean cakes, chemical fertilizers, steamed bone fertilizers, and waterwheels, and implemented the policy of "taking materials locally, processing locally, and supplying locally." In terms of living materials, the Xuchang City Department Store expanded its varieties by 287 kinds, and processed a large number of striped cloth and moon cakes. Now the material preparations are sufficient and are being transported to the tobacco producing areas in a steady stream.

    国营贸易部门和合作社大力收购
    河南许昌专区烟叶已开始上市，国营贸易部门和合作社已积极组织货源配合烟叶收购工作。
    河南许昌专区是全国著名的产烟区。今年全专区播种面积较去年增加百分之十二点四一。虽然今春遭受了风、霜、虫灾，但由于烟农在人民政府扶助下，改善了烟田管理，注意深耕细作，战胜了自然灾害，春烟仍获丰收，晚烟丰收在望。根据专区财委会的重点调查，全区产烟可比去年增加百分之二十八点四七。现在新烟已开始上市，八月中旬只许昌一地每天上市烟叶即达三十多万斤，中国烟麻公司河南省公司和各地合作社、国营贸易部门，已积极开始收购。
    为了配合烟叶收购，中国煤建公司许昌市公司由峰峰、焦作、观音堂等煤矿调进大批煤炭，有计划地分配给许昌、临颍、和尚桥等经营处供应烟农烤烟，并和襄城县、临颍等地合作社建立烤烟煤供应关系。七月下旬各地烟农已开始运煤，仅许昌一地，七月份即销煤三万吨。八月份每天能销一千八百吨。许昌地方国营贸易公司也从湖南、广西购进烤烟用的小毛竹杆四十五万斤，生熟铁七十多万斤，大量供应烟农。专区合作社为了配合烟叶收购，已购回麻饼、豆饼、化肥、蒸骨肥、水车等生产资料，贯彻了“就地取材、就地加工、就地供应”的方针。在生活资料方面，许昌市百货公司扩大品种二百八十七种，并加工大批条子布和月饼。现物资准备充足，正源源运往产烟区。
