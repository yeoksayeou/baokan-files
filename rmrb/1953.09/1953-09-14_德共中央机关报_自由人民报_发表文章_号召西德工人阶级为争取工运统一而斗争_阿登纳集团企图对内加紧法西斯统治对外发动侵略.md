Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 13th, TASS dispatch: According to a report by the German News Agency, the German Communist Party Central Organ "Free People's Daily" published an article discussing the lessons of the West German elections.

The article stated: "The question of war or peace is, in the final analysis, not decided in the Federal Parliament. There is a force capable of saving peace and democracy, and that is the working class. However, it must draw the correct lessons from the election results and form a united front to oppose Adenauer and the monopoly capitalists' attempt to launch an unprecedented attack on the living standards of the working people, because Adenauer can only continue to implement the militarization program by attacking the living standards of the working people."

The newspaper called on the working class to fight for unified action, to oppose the splitters of the workers' movement, to not allow wage reductions and a lowering of the living standards of the working people, and to not allow the realization of militarization and further abolition of democracy.

Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, September 13th, German News Agency dispatch: Adenauer is trying to realize his attempt to deprive Communist parliamentarians of their privileges and declare the Communist Party illegal, an attempt he has been trying to achieve unsuccessfully for several years.

State inspection agencies throughout the country are going to file indictments accusing Communist cadres. Adenauer attempts to sentence Communist parliamentarians to prison on so-called "treason" charges. These Communist spokesmen frequently made speeches in the old Federal Parliament opposing the disastrous "policy of strength" and calling on workers to take united action.

Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, September 13th, German News Agency dispatch: Only thirty-six hours after the end of the West German parliamentary elections, and before the new Federal Parliament has even convened, Adenauer shamelessly announced his plans for aggression. The content of the plan is first and foremost the so-called "liberation" of East Germany, that is, the conquest of the German Democratic Republic and the Polish People's Republic by military force. To support his openly declared intentions, Adenauer intends to launch a new movement to suppress all democratic rights and freedoms in order to establish a dictatorship and force the Social Democratic Party and the German Trade Union Federation to surrender completely. He intends to turn the trade unions into state organizations in accordance with the methods of the Hitler Labor Front. Adenauer hopes that the Social Democratic Party will fully cooperate with him in implementing his aggressive foreign policy. This is specifically demonstrated by Adenauer's request to dissolve and reorganize the state governments dominated by the Social Democratic Party. At the same time, Adenauer also wants to amend the current constitution. The West German heavy industry organ "Industrial Express" said: "There are many loopholes in the constitution that allow the Social Democratic Party to use them to obstruct federal policies. These loopholes must be closed." Some laws that were prepared long ago but were not passed by the previous Federal Parliament, such as laws restricting the freedom of newspapers and radio stations and the conscription law, will now become part of the constitution. The new federal government will be formed according to fascist principles. At the same time, two new ministries will be established: the Ministry of the Army and the "Ministry of Propaganda" formed according to Goebbels' guidelines. Two militarists, Theodor Blank (Christian Democratic Union) and Josef Strauss (Christian Social Union), will be appointed as Minister and Deputy Minister of the Army respectively. Adenauer's State Secretary Lenz (Christian Democratic Union) will be appointed as Minister of "Propaganda." He held a major position in the fascist Ministry of Justice during the Nazi era and is now in close contact with new fascist terrorist organizations.

    号召西德工人阶级为争取工运统一而斗争
    阿登纳集团企图对内加紧法西斯统治对外发动侵略
    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社柏林十日讯：据德意志通讯社报道，德国共产党中央机关报“自由人民报”发表文章，论西德选举的教训。
    文章说：“战争或是和平的问题，归根到底并不在联邦议院决定。能够拯救和平与民主的力量是有的，这就是工人阶级。然而它必须从选举的结果中得出正确的教训，并结成统一战线，起来反对阿登纳和垄断资本家对劳动人民生活水平发动空前的进攻的企图，因为阿登纳只有对劳动人民生活水平进攻才能继续实行军国主义化的纲领。”
    报纸号召工人阶级为争取统一行动而斗争，反对工人运动的分裂分子，不容许减低工资和降低劳动人民的生活水平，不容许实现军国主义化和进一步取消民主。
   【新华社十三日讯】据德意志通讯社波恩十日讯：阿登纳正在设法实现其剥夺共产党议员特权和宣布共产党为非法的企图，这是他几年来想实现而未能成功的一种企图。
    各地的国家检查机关将要提出控告共产党干部的起诉书。阿登纳企图以所谓“叛国”罪名来判处共产党议员徒刑。这些共产党的发言人在旧联邦议院中经常发表言论，反对灾难性的“实力政策”，并号召工人们采取一致行动。
   【新华社十三日讯】德意志通讯社波恩十日讯：西德议会选举结束了才不过三十六小时，新联邦议院还没有举行会议，阿登纳就无耻地宣布了他的侵略计划。计划的内容首先就是所谓“解放”东德，即以军事力量征服德意志民主共和国和波兰人民共和国。为了支持他的公然宣布的意图，阿登纳打算发动一个新的运动来镇压一切民主权利与自由，以便建立独裁政权，并迫使社会民主党和德国工会联合会最后完全投降。他打算按照希特勒劳工阵线的办法，把工会变成国家组织。阿登纳希望社会民主党完全与他一道来执行他的侵略性的外交政策。这一点，从阿登纳要求解散并改组社会民主党占多数的州政府这件事上得到了具体的证明。同时，阿登纳还想修改现在的宪法。西德重工业界机关报“工业快报”说：“宪法里有许多空子使社会民主党得以利用来阻碍联邦政策。这些空子必须堵塞起来。”老早准备好的而没有获得上届联邦议院通过的一些法律，如限制报纸和电台自由的法律和征兵法，现在都将成为宪法的一部分。新联邦政府将根据法西斯原则组成。同时将新成立两个部：陆军部和按照戈培尔的方针组成的“宣传部”。两个军国主义分子，特奥尔多·布兰克（基督教民主联盟）和约瑟夫·斯特劳斯（基督教社会联盟）将被分别任命为陆军部长与副部长。阿登纳的国务秘书伦兹（基督教民主联盟）将被任命为“宣传部”部长，他曾在纳粹时代的法西斯司法部担任过主要职务，同时现在与新法西斯恐怖组织保持密切联系。
