The People's Public Security Forces Vigilantly Defend the Motherland
Li Tianhuan
Deputy Political Commissar of the Public Security Forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army

After the victory of the People's Liberation War across the country, in order to safeguard the victorious achievements of the people's revolution, the Chinese people's armed forces, on the one hand, must consolidate national defense and crush any imperialists who dare to invade our country, and on the other hand, must eliminate domestic counter-revolutionary remnants, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, and defend the construction of the motherland. Under the needs of the new situation and tasks, the Public Security Forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army were established as an important tool for the Chinese people to implement the people's democratic dictatorship.

The Public Security Forces are an integral part of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. According to the overall tasks of the people's armed forces, they, together with the Army, Navy, and Air Force, have their own divisions of labor and cooperate with each other to jointly shoulder the glorious task of consolidating national defense and defending the motherland.

Since its establishment, the People's Public Security Forces have been unremittingly fighting to accomplish the glorious tasks assigned to it by the country and the people. In the past few years, it has, together with the People's Liberation Army's defense forces, annihilated more than two million remnant bandits of Chiang Kai-shek on the Chinese mainland, and effectively打击了 the enemy's sabotage conspiracies. It defends the long border and coastline of the motherland, safeguarding the sacred borders of the country. In the nationwide suppression of counter-revolutionaries, it cooperated with the People's Public Security organs to arrest counter-revolutionaries with heinous crimes, greatly consolidating social order. It protects all important factories, mines, warehouses, railway bridges and other national economic lifelines throughout the country, preventing and cracking the sabotage conspiracies of counter-revolutionary elements, and safeguarding the smooth progress of the motherland's economic construction. It guards the state power organs, guards cities across the country, prevents sabotage and harassment by domestic and foreign enemies, and protects the safety of people's lives and property. In short, in the past few years, the People's Public Security Forces have basically completed the glorious tasks given to them by the country and the people, consolidated the people's democratic dictatorship, and created favorable conditions for the country to carry out large-scale economic construction, national defense construction, and cultural construction. These achievements were made under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, due to the close cooperation of fraternal troops and public security organs, the concerted efforts of all officers and soldiers of the public security forces, and even more so due to the enthusiastic support of the people of the whole country.

Because the People's Public Security Forces shoulder the serious task of consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship and safeguarding the country's economic construction, every commander and fighter must have a high degree of political awareness, an heroic and tenacious, self-sacrificing spirit, and a strong will to overcome difficulties. In the past few years, the soldiers of the Public Security Forces have demonstrated the noble qualities of deeply loving the motherland, being loyal to their duties, and strictly guarding their posts. Many moving deeds have emerged in their execution of tasks. A certain unit fought continuously for eleven days and nights on a snow-capped mountain covered with snow all year round, braving the severe cold and snow, completely annihilating the remnant bandits; and built barracks by themselves in the primeval forest. The troops guarding the islands not only have to fight against invading and harassing enemies, but also have to fight against the harsh natural environment. They are sometimes attacked by typhoons, but they realize their vows with firm determination: "To guard the islands like guarding Tiananmen", "To build the islands into steel fortresses and beautiful homes". The public security soldiers guarding the railways feel even more responsible when they see entire trains of materials urgently needed for consolidating national defense and building the motherland being transported on the railways. They protect the smooth flow of railways and the safety of materials day and night. They cherish the property of the motherland as they cherish their own eyes. Comrade Ding Longzhen of a certain unit put out a fire at the risk of his life while escorting a train on a business trip, preserving the entire train of valuable materials; Comrade Tang Guozhong bravely rescued munitions and materials that were about to explode due to a fire, averting significant losses to state property.

Since the tasks undertaken by the Public Security Forces are not only to fight against overt enemies, but also to fight against hidden enemies; therefore, every commander and fighter must not only have excellent military skills, but also have a high degree of revolutionary vigilance, rich knowledge of concealed struggle, and a fighting style that is resourceful, flexible, bold, and meticulous. In 1950, the public security forces guarding a certain factory in the capital discovered and cracked a case in the middle of the night where bad elements attempted to sabotage the factory's transformer, thereby ensuring the factory's safe production. Comrade Wang Yilong of a certain unit, while on guard duty at a government agency, relied on the masses to investigate and discover that a Chiang bandit battalion commander was hiding weapons nearby, and later ordered him to hand them over. Zhao Yongqing of a certain unit successively cracked several counter-revolutionary cases, and discovered and arrested Wu Dengyun, the head of Yiguandao who was disguised as a peddler and attempted to create disturbances, ensuring social order. This high degree of political vigilance and wisdom is a necessary condition for fighting against counter-revolutionary elements, maintaining social order, and ensuring the safety of people's lives and property.

When performing the task of safeguarding the interests of the country and the people, the Public Security Forces must closely rely on the masses, extensively mobilize the masses, and obtain the active support of the people. Therefore, it should be a model for implementing the state's policies and laws and protecting the interests of the masses. In the past few years, because the Public Security Forces have maintained this glorious tradition of the People's Liberation Army, they have received enthusiastic support from the people and successfully completed their tasks. The public security forces in ethnic minority areas have correctly implemented the ethnic policies of the Central People's Government, united all fraternal ethnic groups, and thus achieved remarkable results in bandit suppression and other tasks. In short, earnestly implementing the government's policies and laws, protecting the interests of the people, and forming a flesh-and-blood relationship with the masses are the keys to ensuring that the Public Security Forces can complete their tasks.

In order to better complete the glorious task of guarding the frontiers and consolidating national defense, the Public Security Forces must be highly vigilant against the aggressive conspiracies of imperialist elements and the harassment and sabotage of Chiang Kai-shek's remnant bandit gangs, strictly guard their glorious posts; and strengthen modern regular training, improve the military skills and political awareness of the troops, and build a strong public security force, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, together with fraternal troops and the people of the whole country, to defend our great country.

    警惕地保卫着祖国的人民公安部队
    中国人民解放军
    公安部队副政治委员
    李天焕
    人民解放战争在全国胜利之后，为了保障人民革命的胜利成果，中国人民的武装力量，一方面要巩固国防，粉碎敢于侵犯我国的任何帝国主义，另一方面要肃清国内反革命残余，巩固人民民主专政，保卫祖国建设。在新的形势和任务的需要下，中国人民解放军公安部队，作为中国人民实行人民民主专政的重要工具而建立起来了。
    公安部队是中国人民解放军的一个组成部分，它根据人民武装力量的总任务，与陆军、海军、空军一起，各有分工而又互相配合地共同担负着巩固国防、保卫祖国的光荣任务。
    人民公安部队自成立以来，就为完成国家和人民所交给它的光荣任务而不懈地奋斗着。几年来，它与人民解放军国防部队一起，歼灭了中国大陆上二百余万残余蒋匪，有力地打击了敌人的破坏阴谋。它卫戍着祖国漫长的边防线和海岸线，保卫着国家的神圣边疆。在全国大张旗鼓的镇压反革命运动中，它配合人民公安机关，逮捕了罪大恶极的反革命分子，大大巩固了社会治安。它保护着全国一切重要工厂、矿山、仓库、铁道桥梁等国家经济命脉，防止并破获了反革命分子的破坏阴谋，保卫着祖国经济建设的顺利进行。它警卫着国家政权机关，警卫着全国城市，防止国内外敌人的暗害和骚扰，保护了人民生命财产的安全。总之，过去的几年中，人民公安部队基本上完成了国家和人民所给予的光荣任务，巩固了人民民主专政，为国家进行大规模经济建设、国防建设和文化建设创造了有利条件。这些成绩是在毛主席、朱总司令的英明领导下，由于兄弟部队和公安机关的密切配合，由于公安部队全体指战员的一致努力，更由于全国人民的热烈支援所得来的。
    因为人民公安部队担负着巩固人民民主专政、保卫国家经济建设的严重任务，所以它的每个指挥员、战斗员，必须具有高度的政治觉悟，要有英勇顽强、自我牺牲的精神和战胜困难的坚强毅力。几年来，公安部队的战士们表现了高度热爱祖国、忠于职责、严守岗位的高贵品质，他们在执行任务中出现了不少动人的事迹。某部在终年积雪的高山上，冒着严寒的风雪连续作战十一昼夜，全歼了残匪；并在原始森林中自己动手修建营房。守卫在海岛上的部队，不但要与侵犯、骚扰的敌人进行斗争，还必须与恶劣的自然环境进行搏斗。他们有时遭受台风的袭击，但他们以坚强的决心，实现着自己的誓言：“要像守卫天安门一样地守卫着海岛”，“把海岛建设成钢铁的堡垒，美丽的家园”。守护铁道的公安战士们，当他们看到整列车的为巩固国防、建设祖国所急需的物资在铁道上输送时，就更加感到自己责任的重大，他们日日夜夜地保护着铁路的畅通和物资的安全。他们像爱护自己眼睛一样，爱护祖国的财产。某部丁龙珍同志一次押车出差，冒着生命危险扑灭火灾，保全了整车的贵重物资；唐国忠同志奋不顾身地抢救因失火而将爆炸的弹药物资，免除了国家财产可能遭到的重大损失。
    由于公安部队所担负的任务不仅要与公开的敌人作战，而且要与暗藏的敌人作战；因此，它的每个指挥员、战斗员不但要有优良的军事素养，而且必须有高度的革命警惕性、丰富的隐蔽斗争的知识和机智、灵活、大胆、细心的战斗作风。一九五○年警卫首都某工厂的公安部队战士，深夜发现并破获了坏分子企图破坏工厂变电器的案件，因而保障了工厂的安全生产。某部王义龙同志在担任某政府机关的警卫任务时，曾依靠群众，调查出附近一个蒋匪营长暗藏武器，后勒令其交出。某部赵永庆曾连续破获反革命案件数起，并发现和逮捕了化装小贩、企图骚乱的一贯道头子吴登云，保证了社会的治安。这种高度的政治警惕和智慧是与反革命分子进行斗争、维持社会治安、保障人民生命财产的安全的必要条件。
    公安部队在执行保卫国家和人民利益的任务时，必须紧密地依靠群众，广泛地发动群众，取得人民的积极支持。因此，它应该是执行国家的政策法令、爱护群众利益的模范。几年来，由于公安部队保持了人民解放军这一光荣传统，因此，得到了人民群众的热烈支援，顺利地完成了任务。在少数民族地区的公安部队正确地执行了中央人民政府的民族政策，团结了各兄弟民族，因而在剿匪及其他各项工作上能获得显著成绩。总之，认真贯彻政府的政策、法令，保护人民的利益，与群众结成血肉的联系，是保证公安部队能够完成任务的关键。
    为了更好地完成卫戍边疆、巩固国防的光荣任务，公安部队必须高度警惕帝国主义分子的侵略阴谋和蒋介石残余匪帮的骚扰破坏，严守自己的光荣岗位；并加强现代化的正规训练，提高部队的军事技术与政治觉悟，建设一支坚强的公安部队，在毛主席、朱总司令的领导下，与各兄弟部队和全国人民一道，保卫我们伟大的国家。
