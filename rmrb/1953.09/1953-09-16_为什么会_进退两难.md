Why are they in a "Dilemma"?
By Our Correspondent Lü Jianzhong

After rural cadres in Henan Province studied the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's "Resolution on Agricultural Production Mutual Aid and Cooperation" and other documents, although some comrades' eagerness for quick success and rash advance suffered setbacks, the problem was not fundamentally resolved ideologically in terms of policy. As a result, they went to the other extreme of letting things drift. On the one hand, these comrades were afraid to face up to the complex problems caused by rash advances. On the other hand, they were reluctant to give up their past rash practices and "achievements." Therefore, they could neither comprehend the spirit and essence of the central policy nor the true thoughts of the masses. They also failed to earnestly publicize the central policy to the masses and consult with them to solve problems. They themselves lay horizontally between policy and the masses, yet complained bitterly, "This really puts me in a dilemma!"

Let's take a look at the situation in Shuangmiao Township, Xiangcheng County, in implementing policies to rectify mutual aid and cooperation organizations:

Shuangmiao Township is a key township with a good foundation for mutual aid and cooperation. However, cadres also made mistakes of eagerness for quick success, rash advance, and formalism in their work, blindly advocating the merging of livestock, and merging large groups. They uniformly ranked all the mutual aid groups in the township into a "three-class nine-grade" formation, and also used cartoons, broadcasts, and other methods to satirize and attack low-level groups and individual farmers, publicly declaring that "three or five households do not count as a group."

After the wheat crop suffered frost damage this spring, the difficulties and problems caused by blind rash advances were exposed. In particular, the "livestock merger groups" were quarreling and breaking up, in a complete mess.

The leadership decided to focus on this township to rectify the mutual aid and cooperation organizations. Initially, the working cadres stationed in the township were very resistant ideologically. They felt that it had been difficult to arrange the mutual aid and cooperation organizations in the township "very neatly" in the past. Once the masses were allowed to be completely voluntary, wouldn't that "change the look" and lose the honor of being a "model township"? Although some township cadres and activists knew that the masses would certainly support the central government's policy of mutual aid and cooperation, they were afraid that once the policy was publicized, the masses would complain about their past coercion and bad leadership.

The leadership first resolved the ideological problems of the working cadres stationed in the township, guiding them to recognize that the purpose of mutual aid and cooperation was for the benefit of the masses, not for show. At the same time, with the Shuangmiao Township Branch Committee of the Chinese Communist Party as the core, they organized all cadres to study the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's "Resolution on Agricultural Production Mutual Aid and Cooperation" in conjunction with the actual work situation in the township and the ideological demands of the masses, explaining that only by handling matters in accordance with the policy can the masses not complain, thus dispelling their concerns. Then, through mutual aid group leaders and propagandists, they held meetings in sub-sections according to production organizations to publicize the central government's policy of mutual aid and cooperation to the masses. At first, the masses were surprised and suspicious: Why are the cadres saying and doing things differently this time than in the past? The cadres took out the central government's documents on mutual aid and cooperation policies to explain to the masses and reviewed that in the past, the work was biased, mainly because the working cadres stationed in the township did not study Chairman Mao's policies well. The masses relaxed and became happy. They said: We were tied too tightly in the past! Wouldn't it be better to act according to Chairman Mao's policy earlier!

Next, the cadres led the masses from point to area to earnestly rectify the original mutual aid and cooperation organizations according to their own wishes and needs. As a result of the rectification, the number of households organized throughout the township not only did not decrease, but increased from the original 570 households to 590 households. The original six agricultural production cooperatives were all consolidated. Of the 59 year-round mutual aid groups, 44 remained; some were rectified and consolidated, some were voluntarily reorganized, some were changed from large to small, and some broke up. The number of temporary seasonal mutual aid groups increased significantly. Jia Xinmiao's year-round group was in chaos in the past due to the merging of livestock, but after rectification, the problem was solved by separating the livestock. Most group members still felt that mutual aid was beneficial, so each household was busy adding farm tools and buying livestock (three heads were bought) to reorganize. Jia Ximing, a middle peasant in this group, had concerns in the past and dared not build a new house. His old house had a lot of things in it, and he was afraid of revealing his wealth by moving when a new house was built. Now, he believes in the Party's policy and bought bricks and tiles to build a new house. There were also some temporary mutual aid groups that were secretly organized in the past, and their production was originally very good, but the cadres did not recognize them as mutual aid groups. Now, they have all happily elected group leaders, saying: We can see the clear sky!

In this way, the work is much easier to lead. Xu Guoshun, the secretary of the township branch, said: "In the past, it was difficult to forcibly tie the masses together and drag them forward. Now, acting in accordance with the policy, there is a road to move forward, and my heart is very bright."

The facts in Shuangmiao Township show that some cadres feel "dilemma" in implementing the central government's policy of mutual aid and cooperation, mainly because their own subjective thinking that does not touch reality is at work, or because they are considering whether they will lose face, whether they will encounter difficulties, and other individualistic thoughts. As long as they can take a step closer to the masses and wholeheartedly hand over the policy to the masses, the problem will be easily solved.

    为什么会“进退两难”
    本报记者  吕建中
    河南省农村干部学习中共中央“关于农业生产互助合作的决议”等文件后，一部分同志的急躁冒进思想虽然碰了壁，可是问题并没有从政策思想上得到根本解决；于是，又走入了放任自流这另一个极端。这些同志，一面对冒进所造成的复杂问题怯于正视，一面对自己过去那一套冒进的做法和“成绩”又留恋不舍，因此他们既不能领会中央政策的精神实质和群众的真实思想，也没有认真向群众宣传中央的政策，并和群众共同商量来解决问题。他们自己把身子横卧在政策和群众之间，却苦恼地说：“真叫我进退两难！”
    让我们看看襄城县双庙乡贯彻政策整顿互助合作组织的情形吧：
    双庙乡是互助合作基础较好的重点乡。但是，干部在工作中也曾犯过急躁冒进和形式主义的毛病，盲目地提倡牲口合槽、并大组，整齐划一地把全乡互助组按“三等九级”大站队，还用漫画、广播等方式讽刺打击低级组和单干户，公开宣布“三户五户不算组”。
    今春小麦遭受霜灾之后，盲目冒进所造成的困难和问题便暴露出来了。尤其是“牲口合槽组”，吵架拆伙，乱成一团。
    领导方面决定以这个乡为重点整顿互助合作组织。最初，驻在该乡的工作干部思想抵抗很大。他们感到：过去好容易把全乡的互助合作组织摆弄得“很整齐”，一旦让群众完全自愿，岂不就“走了样”，丢了“模范乡”的荣誉？部分乡干部和积极分子虽然知道群众一定拥护中央的互助合作政策，但心里却害怕一旦政策宣传下去，群众会埋怨自己过去强迫命令和带头带坏了。
    领导方面首先解决了驻在该乡的工作干部的思想问题，引导他们认清互助合作的目的是为了群众的利益，并不是摆形式；同时以中共双庙乡支部委员会为核心，组织全体干部结合乡里的实际工作情况和群众的思想要求，认真地学习了中共中央“关于农业生产互助合作的决议”，说明只有按政策办事才能使群众不埋怨，解除了他们的顾虑。然后，通过互助组长、宣传员，按生产组织分片开会，向群众宣传了中央的互助合作政策。开始，群众惊疑起来了：为什么干部们这次说的和过去说的做的不一样了呢？干部拿出中央关于互助合作政策的文件来向群众讲解，并检讨过去主要是由于驻在该乡的工作干部没有好好学习毛主席的政策，使工作发生了偏向。群众轻松愉快起来了。他们说：过去捆得太紧！早按毛主席的政策办看美不美！
    接着，干部由点到面地领导群众切实按照他们自己的意愿和需要，整顿了原有的互助合作组织。整顿的结果，全乡组织起来的户数不但没有减少，反而由原来的五百七十户增至五百九十户。原有的六个农业生产合作社都巩固下来了。五十九个常年互助组，剩下四十四个；其中一部分整顿巩固了，一部分重新自愿改组了，一部分由大变小了，一部分散了伙。临时季节性的互助组增加了许多。贾鑫淼的常年组过去虽因牲口合槽乱成一团，但是经过整顿后，把牲口分开，问题解决了。多数组员仍感到互助起来好处多，于是各户又忙着添农具，买牲口
    （买了三头），重新组织起来。这个组里的中农贾西铭，过去思想上有顾虑，不敢盖新房子；他旧房子里东西很多，怕盖起新房来搬家露了富。现在，他相信了党的政策，买了砖瓦盖起新房子来了。还有一部分过去暗中组织起来的临时性互助组，生产本来很好，但干部不承认他们是互助组。现在，他们也都喜气洋洋地选出了组长，说：我们可见了青天！
    这样一来，工作好领导得多了。乡支部书记徐国顺说：“过去强把群众捆在一起，拖着往前走，好吃力。现在按照政策办事，有路往前走了，心里很畅亮。”
    双庙乡的事实说明了：有些干部在贯彻中央互助合作政策当中感到“进退两难”，主要是自己不摸实际的主观主义思想在作怪，或者是考虑自己会不会丢面子、会不会遭到困难等等个人主义的思想在作怪。只要能够向群众走近一步，全心全意地把政策交给群众，问题就好解决了。
