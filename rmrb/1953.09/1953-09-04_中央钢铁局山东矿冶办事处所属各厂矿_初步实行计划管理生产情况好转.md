The Jinling Iron Mine, Liguo Iron Mine, Shandong Kiln Factory, Nanshu Graphite Factory, and other units under the Shandong Mining and Metallurgy Office of the Central Iron and Steel Bureau have initially implemented planned management, and the implementation of national plans is in good condition.

The situation of the factories and mines under the Shandong Mining and Metallurgy Office in completing the plan in the first half of the year is as follows: the average output value completed 112.6 percent of the national plan, which was 190 percent of the same period last year; product quality was also completed or over-completed according to the plan; the financial cost plan was completed by 181 percent; the labor productivity plan was completed by 109 percent; the variety plan was completed according to the plan by all factories and mines except for the hard clay of the Shandong Kiln Factory, which did not complete the plan. Although the factories and mines suffered from rain several times in July, they still completed more than 103 percent of the production plan.

The reason why the factories and mines under the office have achieved the above results is mainly because they have implemented the instructions of the Central Heavy Industry Department on mobilizing the masses to discuss plans and implement planned management; in the implementation of the above instructions, they have also combined the spirit of the anti-bureaucracy struggle, checked work, and strengthened the leadership of the Party, so that the work center of the Party, government, labor union, and the Communist Youth League has shifted from daily business to production.

In mobilizing the masses to discuss the national production plan, all factories and mines have paid attention to political and ideological education, and promoted advanced experience to enlighten the masses to find tricks and put forward rationalization proposals, thus improving various production indicators, making the production plan closer to reality, and laying the ideological foundation for the realization of planned management and providing the necessary technical conditions. For example, in mobilizing the masses, the Shandong Kiln Factory organized the masses to promote advanced experience such as the fast kiln firing method and the reduced frame brick kiln loading method. In the firing section, it created the "three-through four-hook" operation method—adding coal for 30 minutes and ventilating the fire for 40 minutes—which shortened the firing time from 120 hours to 96 hours, and increased the kiln loading from 80 tons to 85 tons; the crushing section improved the power of the large mill, increasing the daily processing from 8.5 tons to 9.5 tons; the daily firing section increased from 30 tons to 42 tons. As a result, a series of production indicators have been improved. Since March, the situation that the plan could not be completed month after month for the past two years has been changed, and the production plan has been over-fulfilled month after month.

Around April, all factories and mines rectified the original records. In June, they began to focus on pilot projects for operational plans. In July, they began to gradually promote them and equipped them with dispatchers. Preliminary implementation of planned management has achieved great results. For example, the Nanshu Graphite Factory focused on pilot operational plans in the mineral processing workshop, and formulated production instruction charts, so that the equilibrium rate of the factory's weekly operational plan reached 94 to 96 percent in July. However, the factories and mines lack a clear set of systems, and there is still confusion in production. For example, the models of the auxiliary workshop of the Shandong Kiln Factory cannot be supplied in time, disrupting the implementation of the operational plan of the forming workshop. Accidents of responsibility also occur frequently. To this end, the Shandong Mining and Metallurgy Office decided to strengthen operational plans and dispatching work as the current central work of the factories and mines, and began to establish a production responsibility system, first establishing the technical safety responsibility system and the equipment maintenance and repair responsibility system to ensure the implementation of the operational plan.

    中央钢铁局山东矿冶办事处所属各厂矿
    初步实行计划管理生产情况好转
    中央重工业部钢铁工业管理局山东矿冶办事处所属金岭铁矿、利国铁矿、山东窑业厂、南墅石墨厂等单位初步实行计划管理，执行国家计划情况良好。
    山东矿冶办事处所属厂矿上半年完成计划的情况是：产值平均完成国家计划的百分之一百十二点六，为去年同期的百分之一百九十；产品质量也按计划完成或超额完成；财务成本计划完成了百分之一百八十一；劳动生产率计划完成百分之一百零九；品种计划除山东窑业厂的硬质粘土没完成计划外，其他各厂矿都按计划完成。各厂矿七月份虽几次遭受雨水影响，但仍完成生产计划的百分之一百零三强。
    该办事处所属各厂矿所以取得以上成绩，主要是贯彻了中央重工业部关于发动群众讨论计划和实行计划管理的指示；在执行上述指示中，又结合贯彻了反官僚主义斗争的精神，检查工作，加强了党的领导，使党、政、工、团的工作中心由日常业务转向生产。
    在发动群众讨论国家生产计划中，各厂矿都注意了政治思想教育，并推广先进经验，启发群众找窍门、提合理化建议，因而提高了各项生产指标，使生产计划更加接近实际，奠定了实现计划管理的思想基础和提供了技术上的必要条件。例如：山东窑业厂在发动群众中，组织群众推广了快速烧窑法和减少架子砖装窑法等先进经验，在烧成段创造了“三通四抅”——三十分钟加煤四十分钟通火的操作法，使烧成时间由一百二十小时缩短到九十六小时，装窑量由八十吨提高到八十五吨；粉碎工段改进了大碾动力，由每天处理八点五吨提高到九点五吨；日烧工段由日产三十吨提高到四十二吨。从而一系列地提高了生产指标，从三月份起改变了两年来月月完不成计划的局面，并转而月月超额完成生产计划。
    各厂矿在四月份前后整顿了原始记录，六月份开始重点试行作业计划，七月份开始逐步推广，并配备了调度人员。初步实行计划管理获得很大成绩。如南墅石墨厂抓住选矿车间重点试行作业计划，制订了生产指示图表，使该厂七月份周作业计划的均衡率达到百分之九十四至百分之九十六。但各厂矿缺乏一套明确的制度，生产中还存在混乱现象。如山东窑业厂辅助车间的模型不能及时供应，打乱了成型车间作业计划的贯彻。责任事故也不断发生。为此，山东矿冶办事处决定把加强作业计划和调度工作作为各厂矿当前的中心工作，并开始建立生产责任制，首先把技术安全责任制和设备维护检修责任制建立起来，以保证作业计划的贯彻。
