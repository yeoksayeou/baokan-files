Xinhua News Agency, Paris, September 18th, (via TASS): According to news from London, Labour MP Douglas Jaye criticized the US and British foreign policy in the Far East.

Jaye pointed out that Dulles' misguided diplomacy makes the Korean political conference highly likely to be sabotaged. He said that Dulles obviously values ​​Syngman Rhee's friendship more than the friendship of Britain and the Commonwealth countries.

Jaye concluded that the British people will never participate in a full-scale war against China. They demand that the United Nations become a forum for resolving disputes and maintaining the law, rather than a tool for anti-communism. The British people believe that the Beijing government is the true government of China and must become a member of the United Nations now. The British people demand a peaceful solution to the Far East issue and firmly believe that peace-loving countries like India can make a significant contribution to this.

    英国工党议员贾埃
    抨击美国预谋破坏政治会议
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社巴黎十八日讯：据伦敦消息，工党议员道格拉斯·贾埃批评美国和英国在远东的外交政策。
    贾埃指出，杜勒斯的错误外交使朝鲜政治会议大有被破坏的可能。他说，杜勒斯显然把李承晚的友谊看得比英国和联邦国家的友谊还重要。
    贾埃最后说，英国人民决不参加对中国的全面战争。他们要求联合国成为解决争端和维护法律的讲坛，而不要成为反共的工具。英国人民认为，北京政府是中国真正的政府，必须现在就成为联合国的一员。英国人民要求和平解决远东问题，并深信像印度这样爱好和平的国家对此能有很大的贡献。
