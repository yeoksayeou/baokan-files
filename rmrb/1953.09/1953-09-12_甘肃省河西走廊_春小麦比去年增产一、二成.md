Gansu Province's Hexi Corridor
Spring Wheat Production Increases by 10-20% Compared to Last Year

The spring wheat in the Hexi Corridor of Gansu Province was completely harvested in early September, with production generally increasing by 10-20% compared to last year. In the Wuwei Special District, over 3.1 million mu of wheat yielded an average of over 140 jin per mu. In the Jiuquan Special District, over 900,000 mu of wheat yielded an average of over 250 jin per mu. The harvests in "Golden Zhangye, Silver Wuwei" were even better, with Zhangye County averaging over 340 jin per mu, and 17 agricultural districts in Wuwei County averaging over 250 jin per mu. This year's wheat kernels are full, with each dou generally weighing one to two jin more than last year. Many large-area, high-yield records have also emerged this year. According to relatively precise surveys, the average yield in Gaotai County was over 420 jin per mu, an increase of 33 jin per mu compared to last year. In Liangjiadun Township, Zhangye, the average yield for the entire township reached over 500 jin per mu, and the highest average yield among the high-yield households in Jiuquan was 814 jin per mu.

The Hexi Corridor is a well-known arid region in the country, with a cold climate and little rainfall. The harvest season is late, and crops rely entirely on snowmelt from the Qilian Mountains for irrigation, but the land is fertile and yields are high. Because there was little snow last winter, local Party and government organs actively led the masses in drought prevention this spring, digging more than 40,000 wells, building small-scale water conservancy projects, installing waterwheels, and saving water, thus greatly expanding the irrigated area. There have also been great improvements in cultivation techniques, with wheat fields generally being plowed one to two more times than last year. The wheat seeds sown were all carefully selected last year, and 80% were treated with chemicals before sowing. In the Jiuquan Special District, the vast majority of wheat fields have been changed from broadcast sowing to row sowing.

### 甘肃省河西走廊  春小麦比去年增产一、二成

    甘肃省河西走廊
    春小麦比去年增产一、二成
    甘肃省河西走廊春小麦在九月上旬已全部收割完毕，一般比去年增产一二成。武威专区三百一十多万亩小麦，平均每亩产量一百四十多斤，酒泉专区九十多万亩小麦，平均每亩产量二百五十多斤。“金张掖、银武威”的收成更好，张掖全县平均每亩产量达三百四十多斤，武威县十七个农业区，平均每亩产量二百五十斤以上。今年麦粒饱满，一般每斗比去年重一斤到二斤。今年还出现了很多大面积高额产量纪录。根据比较精确的调查，高台全县平均每亩产量四百二十多斤，每亩比去年增产三十三斤。张掖梁家墩乡，全乡平均每亩产量达五百多斤，酒泉丰产户最高平均每亩八百十四斤。
    河西走廊是全国有名的干旱地区，气候冷、雨量少，收割季节晚，庄稼全靠祁连山融化的雪水灌溉，但土地肥美，产量很高。因为去冬雪较小，当地党政机关今春积极领导群众防旱，先后打井四万多眼，兴修小型水利、安水车、节省用水，因此大大扩大了灌溉面积。在耕作技术上也有很大改进，麦田一般都比去年多耕了一次到两次。种的麦籽都是去年经过精选的，播种时百分之八十都用药剂拌种。酒泉专区绝大部分麦田都由撒播改为条播。
