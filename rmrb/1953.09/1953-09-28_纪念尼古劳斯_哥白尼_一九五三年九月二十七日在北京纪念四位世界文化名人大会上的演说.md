This year marks the 410th anniversary of the death of Nicolaus Copernicus, the great Polish scientist and founder of modern science, and the 480th anniversary of his birth. He achieved accomplishments in theology, economics, art, medicine, and literature, but his greatest contribution was in astronomy. Based on actual observations and previous records, he pioneered the heliocentric theory, delivering a fatal blow to Ptolemy's geocentric theory, which had dominated for over 1,300 years. In Copernicus's time, the geocentric theory recognized by the Vatican authorities became the main argument of orthodox doctrine, and anyone who did not believe in this theory was regarded as a heretic. Therefore, Copernicus's theory shook the foundation of the theocratic theory in medieval Europe. He made an important contribution to the struggle against feudalism, superstition, and idealism, and therefore, the World Peace Council called on all progressive people to hold commemorations this year.

Copernicus was born at the end of the fifteenth century (1473) and died in the middle of the sixteenth century (1543). The era he lived in was a time of decline of feudal rule and the rise of capitalism, a time of transition between the old and the new, a time of Renaissance and religious revolution, and a time of great geographical discoveries. As Engels said, "It was an unprecedented and greatest progressive revolution, an era that needed and produced giants." Contemporaries of Copernicus included Columbus, who discovered the New World; Leonardo da Vinci, the artist and scientist; Michelangelo, the sculptor; Raphael, the painter; and Thomas More, the politician and scientist. Among these giants, Copernicus was not the most famous figure at the time, but in terms of the impact on later generations' thoughts, Copernicus was undoubtedly the greatest. He was the first person to challenge theocracy with science, and he directly shook the theoretical foundation of medieval religious rule, the old worldview. He liberated science from the shackles of theology and developed it by leaps and bounds.

At that time, Europeans' view of the universe was the view of Aristotle and Ptolemy. In this cosmic structure, the Earth occupied a special position in the universe, that is, the center of the universe. It neither rotated on its own axis nor revolved around the sun, while the moon, Venus, Mercury, the sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the stars all revolved around the Earth in layers. This view of the universe conforms to our intuitive impression but violates the laws of celestial motion because, in reality, the Earth is a planet in the solar system, and it revolves around the sun following the same laws as other planets. Ptolemy's theory was wrong, so it could not provide a satisfactory explanation for celestial motions, especially the motion of planets. As astronomical observations became more and more accurate, this theory became increasingly untenable. Although some astronomers at the time knew that this theory had many unreasonable aspects, no one dared to openly oppose it because Ptolemy's view of the universe relied on the authority of Aristotle's theory in the Middle Ages, and people in the Middle Ages regarded every word of Aristotle as sacred truth, which could only be extended and not refuted. More importantly, the most authoritative Vatican at the time was doing its best to support Ptolemy's view of the universe because the Bible said that God created everything for mankind, and this idea also required placing the Earth in a special position in the universe. The Vatican often used the charge of "heresy" to threaten people. At this time, only a person with great courage could break free from the shackles of religious thought and dare to resist this pressure. Copernicus was such a giant.

In the early sixteenth century, based on his observations of astronomical phenomena, Copernicus already knew that the old view of the universe was wrong and believed that the Earth rotated on its own axis while revolving around the sun. This could explain the dynamics of planets, which were considered mysterious at the time, more completely. In his correspondence with his friends, he had clearly put forward an outline of his view of the universe, but he knew that after publishing this opinion, he would be persecuted by the church. Therefore, he proceeded with his work steadily and carefully. He strove to establish the new view of the universe on the basis of scientific facts. After returning to his country from Italy in 1505, Copernicus served as a manager of the Vatican, practiced medicine, wrote a paper on the chaotic situation of currency in Frauenburg, and also led the struggle to defend his homeland. However, for more than 40 years, he always insisted on astronomical observation work. He created the most accurate table of planetary positions at that time and wrote his book "De revolutionibus orbium coelestium" ("On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres"). This book was entirely armed with scientific facts, so his friend Rheticus said: Even Aristotle would abandon his own views after reading this book. Under the urging of relatives and friends, Copernicus finally published his work before his death. In order to enable his book to be published smoothly, he used a letter to the Pope as a preface. In the preface, he said: "If there are people who have a superficial understanding and no mathematical knowledge, and who wantonly criticize or refute my works based on this or that section of the Bible, I am not only not prepared to answer them, but also despise such ignorant opinions." In this way, Copernicus straightforwardly and cleverly declared war on the authority of religion.

Even before his cosmology was published, it was attacked by Martin Luther, the founder of Protestantism, who scolded him as a madman. Later, the Catholic Church also noticed the revolutionary role of this theory, and the Inquisition began to threaten people who believed in the heliocentric theory with severe punishments. The Italian philosopher Bruno believed in and promoted Copernicus's view of the universe and was burned alive on the cross. The great scientist Galileo was also interrogated and threatened with severe punishments for insisting on believing in and spreading the heliocentric theory. However, truth is indestructible, and the heliocentric theory became more and more consolidated day by day due to the joint efforts of scientists. From Kepler and Galileo to Newton, the heliocentric theory finally became an irrefutable truth. In 1616, the Pope announced that "De revolutionibus orbium coelestium" was included in the list of banned books. In 1757, forced by the situation, he had to lift the ban. In 1822, the Pope himself had to admit the heliocentric theory. Science finally triumphed over theocracy with great and irresistible force.

Copernicus's theory not only brought about a revolution in astronomy but also brought people a spirit of scientific practice. He told people how to criticize old theories and how to understand the world. He inspired us to have the courage to doubt and criticize historical works and authoritative theories that people consider sacred and inviolable and to pursue the truth in observing nature and practice. He guided people's understanding of things not to stop at the surface but to penetrate into the essence of things through practice and comprehensive analysis. For example, the understanding of astronomical phenomena cannot be dominated by intuition, thinking that the Earth is immobile, but it is necessary to comprehensively and deeply observe and study the movement of all planets in order to draw correct conclusions. Copernicus's influence on human thought was also extremely profound. As Engels said: He announced the independence of natural science, liberated science from the shackles of religion, shattered the Church-promoted anthropocentric view of the universe, overthrew the special position of the Earth in the sky since Aristotle, and proved with facts that the Earth and other planets follow the same laws of motion, laying an important cornerstone for a correct and unified view of the universe. The great German poet Goethe once commented on Copernicus's contribution:

"Copernicus's heliocentric theory has shaken human consciousness so deeply that no creation or explanation in ancient times can be compared with it. Not long after Columbus confirmed that the Earth was a sphere, the Earth's title as the master of the universe was also deprived. Never before has human consciousness been turned upside down so dramatically. Because if the Earth is not the center of the universe, then the things believed by countless ancient people will become a void. Who will still believe in the Garden of Eden, the praise of hymns, and religious stories?"

Copernicus's great contribution has only gained its due scientific status in the era of the people. When capitalist countries publish histories of science, they often neglect Copernicus's creation when discussing the birth of modern science, regarding Copernicus as an inheritor of ancient science rather than a creator of modern science. Some even say that he was merely a later disciple of the Pythagorean school. This theory is a reactionary theory that reverses the facts. The Pythagoreans were idealists. Although they advocated that the Earth revolved around the sun, it was because they believed that the sun was a ball of fire and should be located in the center of the world. There should be ten planets revolving around the fire, and they should also emit harmonious tones when rotating. Therefore, their cosmology was full of mysterious fantasies. Lenin criticized their philosophy as: "Myths that connect primitive scientific ideas with absurd fantasies similar to religion." Copernicus started from practice and established the heliocentric theory on precise observational facts. He dedicated his life to obtaining factual evidence. His theory was built on a solid foundation and was fundamentally different from the Pythagorean's conjecture.

The revolutionary teachers Engels and Stalin fully estimated Copernicus's contribution to human history. Engels regarded Copernicus as a revolutionary fighter who liberated science from the shackles of theocracy. Stalin also used Copernicus's contribution as a glorious precedent when mentioning the revolutionary and creative role of science. Copernicus's efforts and his victory have encouraged all people who are fighting for scientific truth and for the most beautiful ideal of mankind—the communist ideal. People will never forget Copernicus's achievements.

Today, as we fight to defend peace, democracy, and freedom, we deeply cherish this pioneer who contributed his brilliant life to science and freedom of thought. (Attached picture)

    纪念尼古劳斯·哥白尼
    ——一九五三年九月二十七日在北京纪念四位世界文化名人大会上的演说
    竺可桢
    今年是近代科学的创始人伟大的波兰科学家，尼古劳斯·哥白尼逝世的四百一十周年，也是他诞生的四百八十周年。他对于神学、经济、艺术、医学、文学都有所成就，但他一生最大贡献是在天文学上。他根据实际观测和以前的记载，首创地动学说，给予统治了一千三百多年的托伦梅的天动学说以致命的打击。在哥白尼的时代，教廷当局所认可的天动学说成为正教教义的主要论据，任何不相信这学说的人就被目为异教徒。所以哥白尼的学说动摇了欧洲中世纪神权论的基础，他在人类的反封建、反迷信、反唯心主义的斗争中，有着重要的贡献，因此世界和平理事会，号召全体进步人士在今年普遍举行纪念。
    哥白尼生于十五世纪末（一四七三年），死于十六世纪中叶（一五四三年）。他所处的时代正是封建统治没落，资本主义兴起的时代，是新旧交替的时代，是文艺复兴和宗教革命的时代，是伟大的地理发现的时代。就如恩格斯所说：“是一个前所未有的最伟大的进步的革命，是一个需要和产生巨人的时代”。和哥白尼同时的，有发现新大陆的哥伦布、艺术家和科学家达·芬奇、雕刻家米凯兰杰罗、画家拉斐尔、政治家兼科学家托马斯·摩尔，在这些巨人中间，哥白尼在当时并不能算是最著名的人物，但从对后世的思想上影响来说，哥白尼无疑地是最伟大的人物。他是科学向神权挑战第一人，他直接撼动了中世纪宗教统治的理论基础，旧宇宙观。把科学从神学束缚中解放，而突飞猛进地发展起来。
    当时欧洲人的宇宙观是亚里士多德和托伦梅的宇宙观。在这种宇宙结构中地球占有了宇宙中的特殊地位，就是宇宙的中心，它既不自转也不环绕太阳作公转，而月亮、金星、水星、太阳、火星、木星、土星以及恒星等，都依次层层地绕着地球转动，这种宇宙观符合我们的直觉印象，但违反了天体运动的规律，因为实际上地球是太阳系中一颗行星，他和其他行星统循着一样的规律绕太阳而转动的。托伦梅学说的理论是错的，所以它对天体运动，特别是行星的运动，不能作圆满的解释。天文观测愈来愈精确，这个学说就愈来愈站不住足了。当时若干天文学家虽然知道这学说有许多不合理的地方，但没有人敢公然反对它。因为托伦梅的宇宙观，是依靠着亚里士多德的学说在中世纪的权威的，而在中世纪的人们把亚里士多德的每一句话都看成神圣的真理，只能引申，不敢辩驳。更主要的还有中世纪时最有权威的天主教廷，在尽力支持托伦梅的宇宙观。因为圣经上说上帝创造一切都是为的人类，这种思想也需要把地球放在宇宙中的特殊地位。天主教廷常用“离经叛道”的罪名来威胁人们，这时要有极大勇气的人，才能摆脱宗教思想的束缚，敢于反抗这种压力。哥白尼就是这样的巨人。
    哥白尼在十六世纪初，根据他对天文现象的观测，已经知道旧宇宙观是错误的，相信地球是一面自转一面绕着太阳转动，这样可以比较完满地说明当时认为行踪神秘的行星动态。在他和他的朋友通信中已经明确地提出了他的宇宙观的概要，但是他知道发表这种意见以后，会受到教会的迫害，因此他稳步小心的进行工作，他努力把新宇宙观建立在科学的事实的基础上。一五○五年哥白尼从意大利回国后，他当过教廷的管理者，行过医，写过一篇论文论述弗劳恩堡地方货币混乱的情形。也领导过保卫祖国的斗争，但四十余年内，他始终坚持着天文的观测工作，他创造了当时最精确的行星位置表，写好了他“天体运行”这本书。这本书是全部用科学的事实武装起来的，所以他的朋友列提克斯说：就是亚里士多德看了这本书，也会放弃他自己的见解。在亲友们的督促下，哥白尼终于在临死前发表了他的著作。为了使他的书能够顺利发行，他以给教皇的一封信作为序言。在序言里他说：“假使有一知半解的人，并无数学知识，而根据圣经这一段或那一段，妄肆批评或者驳斥我的著作，我不但不预备答复他们，而且还要轻视这样的无知的见解。”哥白尼就这样直率而巧妙地向宗教的权威宣战了。
    在他的宇宙论发表以前就曾经遭到新教的开创者马丁路德的攻击，骂他是疯子，以后天主教也注意这个学说的革命作用，异端裁判所便开始以严刑威胁相信地动学说的人们。意大利的哲学家布鲁诺相信而且宣传哥白尼的宇宙观，被活活烧死在十字架上，伟大的科学家伽利略也因为坚持信仰和传播地动学说，还被审讯和受到严刑的威胁。然而真理是颠扑不破的，地动学说却由于科学家们的共同努力，一天比一天更巩固了。从克普勒、伽利略到牛顿，地动学说终于成了无可辩驳的真理。一六一六年教皇宣布把“天体运行”列入禁书，到一七五七年被形势所逼，只好解除禁令，到一八二二年教皇自己也只好承认了地动学说。科学终于以伟大的不可抑制的力量，战胜了神权。
    哥白尼学说不但带来了天文学上的革命，也带给人们科学的实践精神。他告诉人们怎样批判旧的学说，怎样认识世界。他启示我们，要有勇气怀疑并批判人们认为神圣不可侵犯的历史著作和权威学说，而在观察自然实践中追求真理。他指导人们对事物的认识，不能停止在外表，而要通过实践，和全面的分析，来深入事物的本质。譬如对天文现象的认识，就不能让直觉支配，以为地球不动，而要全面深入地观测研究全部行星的运行，才能得出正确的结论。哥白尼在人类思想上的影响也是极深刻的，就如恩格斯所说：他宣布了自然科学的独立，把科学从宗教的束缚中解放了出来，他粉碎了教会所提倡的人类中心说的宇宙观，推翻了亚里士多德以来地球在天空中的特殊地位，以事实证明地球和其他行星一样，都按同一规律运行，为正确的统一的宇宙观铺了一块重要的基石。德国大诗人歌德曾经这样评论过哥白尼的贡献：
    “哥白尼地动学说撼动人类意识之深，自古以来无一种创见，无一种说明，可与之比，当地是球形被哥伦布证实以后不久，地球为宇宙主宰的尊号，亦被剥夺了。自古以来没有这样天翻地覆地把人类的意识倒转来过。因为若是地球不是宇宙的中心，那么无数古人相信的事物将成为一场空了。谁还会相信伊甸的乐园，赞美诗的歌颂，宗教的故事呢？”
    哥白尼的伟大贡献，到了人民的时代才获得科学上应有的地位。资本主义国家出版的科学史，讲到近代科学的诞生时，多忽视哥白尼的创造，把哥白尼看作古代科学的继承者，而不是近代科学的创造者。甚至说他不过是毕达哥拉斯学派的后起门徒。这种理论是颠倒事实的反动理论。毕达哥拉斯学派是唯心论者，他们虽然主张地球绕太阳转动，但那是因为他们认为太阳是一团火，应该居于世界的中央。绕着火转的应该有十个行星，旋转时还要发出谐和的音调。因此他们的宇宙论充满了神秘的幻想。列宁批判他们的哲学是：“连结了原始的科学思想和类似宗教的荒诞怪想的神话。”而哥白尼是从实践出发，是把地动学说建立在精密的观测事实上，为了取得事实根据，他献出了一生的精力，他的学说是建立在坚固的基础上的，和毕达哥拉斯的悬想，是有根本区别的。
    革命导师恩格斯和斯大林，都充分估量了哥白尼在人类历史上的贡献。恩格斯把哥白尼看作是把科学从神权束缚中解放出来的革命战士，斯大林在提到科学的革命创造作用时，也以哥白尼的贡献为光辉的先例。哥白尼的努力和他的胜利鼓舞了为科学真理，为人类最美好的理想——共产主义理想——而斗争的一切人们，人们也永远不忘哥白尼的功绩。
    今天当我们为保卫和平、民主与自由而战斗时，我们更深深怀念这位为科学、为思想自由而贡献了光辉的一生的先驱者。（附图片）
