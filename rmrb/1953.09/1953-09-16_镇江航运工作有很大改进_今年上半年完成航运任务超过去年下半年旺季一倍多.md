　　Zhenjiang's shipping work has greatly improved. The shipping tasks completed in the first half of this year exceed more than double that of last year's peak season.

　　Zhenjiang's shipping industry is developing rapidly. The shipping tasks completed in the first half of this year exceed more than double that of last year's peak season.

　　Zhenjiang City has the Grand Canal running through it from north to south, with waterways reaching deep into northern and southern Jiangsu, and the Yangtze River can be navigated year-round from east to west. There is also the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway connecting various places, so most of the materials transported to Jiangsu from various places are concentrated in Zhenjiang for transshipment. With the development of the motherland's economic construction and the active exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, Zhenjiang's cargo carrying capacity in the first half of this year has exceeded 170% of the peak season in the second half of last year. The transported goods are mainly building materials for the Huai River control construction site in northern Jiangsu and basic construction in various places, as well as industrial products for rural areas. The quantity of native products transported out is also very large. In the first half of the year, 12,000 tons of reeds (for papermaking) were transported to Tianjin, and 19,000 tons of live pigs were transported to Shanghai. According to the current situation, it is estimated that the peak season transportation volume in the second half of the year will exceed the total transportation volume of last year.

　　In order to meet the needs of the increasing transportation volume, the shipping workers in Zhenjiang City have been continuously studying advanced experiences and improving operating methods over the past year. More than 50 cargo tugboats in Zhenjiang City have now universally adopted the advanced experience of Soviet shipping - the single-line barge transportation method. Last September, the Huadong No. 30 vessel of the Huadong Inland River Shipping Company, after learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, twice set a new national record for downstream towing capacity, averaging 24.62 tons per horsepower, which is five times more than the past towing capacity. Subsequently, the Feiling vessel of the Yangtze River Port Authority set a new national record for upstream towing capacity, averaging 8.39 tons per horsepower. This drove the public and private ships throughout the port to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and the towing capacity generally increased by more than two times. Nearly 100,000 tons of yellow sand, stone, cement, and other materials were transported successively, strongly supporting the Huai River control project in northern Jiangsu. This spring and summer, the difficulties of shallow water in the canal were overcome, and disaster relief grain was transported to northern Jiangsu, providing timely support for farmers in disaster areas to overcome famine and resume production. On August 11th this year, the Flying Wheel vessel of the Yangtze River Port Authority set a new record for towing a wood raft of 290 "matzi" upstream to Nanjing, not only completing the plan two days ahead of schedule but also exceeding the vessel's original towing capacity by more than six times.

　　Loading and unloading workers are also actively improving operating methods to cooperate with shipping workers in increasing transportation efficiency. The Shanghai-Hankou passenger and cargo liners originally took ten days for a round trip. After the loading and unloading time was shortened by the dockworkers in Zhenjiang and other docks, the round trip period of the liners has been shortened from ten days to seven days. The loading and unloading workers have also implemented a scientific assignment system, increasing work efficiency by more than two times. Since last year, the average loading and unloading volume per person per day has increased from six tons to nine tons, creating a record high of 8,000 tons of loading and unloading in Zhenjiang Port, exceeding the historical record by three times.

　　After the democratic reform movement, wooden sailing ships also reorganized their grassroots organizations, and the transportation management department simplified procedures. Work that used to take three to five days can now be completed within an hour, strengthening the turnover of ships. Now, the Zhenjiang transportation management department is working with relevant departments to study and strengthen planned transportation to welcome the peak season transportation work. They are prepared to uniformly allocate all transportation tools, equip towing capacity according to the performance of each tugboat, achieve regular departure and return to port, so that the production target of each horsepower is increased to an average of 300 ton-kilometers per day (eight hours), exceeding the general transportation target by 37%.

    镇江航运工作有很大改进
    今年上半年完成航运任务超过去年下半年旺季一倍多
    镇江航运事业日渐发达，今年上半年完成航运任务超过去年下半年旺季一倍多。
    镇江市南北有运河贯通，水道深入苏北、苏南各地，东西有长江可终年航行。还有沪宁铁路联接各地，所以各地运到江苏的物资，大都集中在镇江转口。随着祖国经济建设的发展，城乡物资交流的活跃，镇江今年上半年货物运载量已超过去年下半年最旺季节的百分之一百七十。载运的货物以供应苏北治淮工地和各地基本建设的建筑器材，以及农村的工业品占多数。土产运出的数量亦很大，上半年运往天津的芦苇（造纸用）有一万二千吨，运往上海的毛猪有一万九千吨。按目前的情况估计，下半年的旺季运输量将超过去年全年的运输量。
    为了适应运输量增长的需要，镇江市的航运工人，一年来不断地努力学习先进经验，改进操作法。镇江市的五十多艘货运拖轮，现已普遍采用了苏联航运的先进经验——一列式轮驳运输法。去年九月，华东内河轮船公司的华东三十号轮，学习苏联先进经验后，两度创造顺水航行拖载量的全国新纪录，平均每匹马力拖载二十四点六二吨，比过去拖量增加五倍。接着长江港务局的飞铃轮又创造逆水航行拖载量全国新纪录，平均每匹马力拖载八点三九吨。这样就带动了全港的公私轮船学习苏联先进经验，拖载量普遍提高二倍以上。先后运输了近十万吨的黄沙、石料、水泥等，有力地支援了苏北治淮工程。今年春夏间又克服了运河浅水困难，运送苏北救灾粮，及时支援了灾区农民生产度荒。今年八月十一日，长江港务局的飞行轮又创造拖带二百九十两码子的木排逆水拖往南京的新纪录，不但提前二天完成计划，拖载量还超过了该轮原拖载量六倍多。
    搬运工人也在积极改进操作法，配合航运工人增加运输效率。上海至汉口的大客货班轮，原来十天才能来回一次，经镇江的码头工人和其他码头工人缩短装卸时间，班轮的来回期已从十天缩短到七天，搬运工人们还实行了科学的派工制，提高工作效率二倍多。自去年开始，搬运工人每人每天平均装卸量从六吨提高到九吨，创造了镇江港装卸八千吨的最高纪录，超过历史纪录三倍多。
    木帆船经过民主改革运动，也整顿了基层组织，运输管理部门又简化了手续，过去费时三天至五天的工作，现在一小时内即可办完。加强了船只周转。现在镇江运输管理部门，正和有关各部门研究加强计划运输，迎接旺季的运输工作，他们准备统一调配所有运输工具，按照各拖轮的性能，配备拖量，做到定期开出，定期回港，使每匹马力的生产指标提高到平均每天（八小时）三百吨公里，超过一般运输指标百分之三十七。
