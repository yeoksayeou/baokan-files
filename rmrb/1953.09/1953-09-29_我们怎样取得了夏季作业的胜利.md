    How We Achieved Victory in Summer Operations
    Bi Deyu, Director of Dailing Forest Industry Experimental Bureau

    Forestry production takes place in a vast and dispersed natural environment, conducting open-air operations that have historically relied on the weather, resulting in seasonal production. Both logging and transportation could only be carried out in winter. Transportation operations, in particular, mainly depended on the natural sliding force of ice and snow. Therefore, every winter, a large number of people and horses would be mobilized to go up the mountains. Sometimes the people and horses would go up early, but if it didn't snow, then the people would wait for the snow; if it snowed early, but the people hadn't gone up yet, then the snow would wait for the people. Heavy snow would bury the products, and light snow wouldn't allow the timber to slide. This caused huge amounts of wasted work and resources every year. If the snow came late, the transportation period would be shortened, requiring a large increase in manpower, causing the entire winter operation to be in a state of rush. Quality and grade distinctions were often ignored, and timber of different lengths and species would be piled up indiscriminately, causing business chaos. When the ice and snow melted in the spring, the people and horses would all come down the mountain, and most of our work would be forced to stop. Moreover, because loggers couldn't be fixed, a large amount of recruitment would occur before each winter. Most of the temporarily recruited workers were peasants and urban poor with unskilled production techniques and low work efficiency, resulting in large waste, high costs, many accidents, and the occupation of large amounts of state funds. The operation method of working one winter and resting for three seasons became a characteristic of forestry operations and the biggest obstacle to the development of the forest industry. With the urgent need for timber in economic construction, seasonal production could no longer meet the needs of the country.

    In order to change the seasonal operation method, in 1950, we first implemented "autumn logging and winter transportation," extending the operation season by a factor of two. The experiment was successful, and we then prepared to further fix workers and carry out year-round operations. In 1951, we had planned a summer production task of 40,000 cubic meters, but because we underestimated the conditions and were not adequately prepared, we only logged 15,000 cubic meters of timber before being unable to continue. The logged timber was not even transported down, resulting in the accumulation of a large amount of state funds. After this setback, the attempt at year-round operation was opposed by many workers and technicians. They said that year-round operation had never been heard of in forestry production. Some of the older forestry comrades said, "Even the Soviet Union only has partial year-round operation; how can we compare with the Soviet Union's conditions?" They emphasized that the reasons for not being able to carry out year-round operation were: In the spring and summer in the forest area, it is hot and rainy, there are many mosquitoes, and the transportation roads are muddy and impassable for vehicles and horses. If these adverse natural conditions are not overcome, it will be difficult to move towards year-round operation. But we were determined to continue experimenting.

    In the winter of 1951, we continued to try year-round operation, but because we underestimated the difficulties of year-round operation and did not find appropriate ways to solve the transportation difficulties, we suffered a second failure.

    This failure gave us valuable lessons. In order to solve the transportation difficulties of year-round operation, we proposed to make full use of mechanized and semi-mechanized timber transportation tools and decided to extend the simple forest railway as much as possible to overcome the difficulties of transporting timber by cattle and horses and transporting grain and fodder by manual labor in the summer. We began to build five kilometers of simple forest railway in the original Hongyegou logging area. As a result of this measure, transportation costs were saved by 3,218 yuan per kilometer compared to using cattle and horses to transport timber.

      In the autumn of 1952, loggers in the Liaodong Liumaogou forest area created advanced timber transportation tools, providing favorable conditions for year-round operation. We immediately sent five technicians and cadres to learn, and later extracted 18 people, including logging yard leaders, to study. The new Liaodong timber transportation tools indeed opened up a broad road for year-round operation. However, we encountered obstacles from conservative thinking in promoting the new tools. Some people said that the new Liaodong tools were not suitable for the specific conditions of Dailing; others dared not promote them, fearing that promotion would result in waste. After discovering these situations, we immediately convened a forum of logging yard leaders and technicians, timely eliminated the above-mentioned ideological concerns, and decided to first promote experiences that were certain of success, promote inventions and creations, and launch a movement to promote and create new tools. The first logging yard first promoted three new types of tools from Liaodong: double-axle skids, single-axle skids, and wooden rail automatic sleds. Not long after the promotion, new difficulties were discovered. Some people called the promotion of new tools "twice as difficult," meaning that when using single-axle skids, the speed of heavily loaded vehicles downhill was too fast, causing great fear; pushing heavy empty vehicles up the mountains was very tiring. At this time, we mobilized workers to improve the new tools. The workers first改造（gaizao -transformed/reformed） the car body, reducing its weight by one-third. Then, the workers created a safety deceleration brake and converted the double-axle skids into iron-wood hybrid skids. Workers in the tenth logging yard created wooden skids. The creation and improvement of these tools improved efficiency, ensured safety, and enabled the smooth development of the new tools promotion movement, laying a favorable foundation for year-round operation.

    We also learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and carried out grid-based survey and design work in the logging area. After the survey, we correctly grasped the forest land area, timber storage, terrain, landforms, soil, and tree species. Then, based on the survey, we carried out the design, such as studying which tools would minimize transportation costs, where to dig water wells, build workers' dormitories, and build cowsheds, and compiled a schedule operation chart. After review and approval, all eleven logging yards in the Dailing forest area implemented year-round operation this year.

    In the process of carrying out year-round operation, the first logging yard achieved the best results due to the full utilization of natural conditions. In winter, they first logged the distant areas, and in animal-powered transportation, they first transported from distant places back, getting closer and closer, so that workers could more easily reach their quotas day by day and become more and more energetic. They also paid attention to various natural conditions, and when transporting timber, in winter, they first transported the timber from the swampy and muddy areas that could not be easily transported in summer; they took advantage of the fact that the snow had not melted to first haul the timber from the sunny areas and then the timber from the shady slopes (because the snow in the sunny areas melts earlier, about twenty days earlier than in the shady slopes). They also paid attention to natural and geographical conditions, flexibly using new tools in conjunction with cattle and horse teams, and continued to build ice roads and snow track ruts in winter to improve transportation capacity. These many specific measures enabled the first logging yard to smoothly implement the year-round operation plan this year.

    In the first half of 1953, we adopted these methods and completed 131 percent of the logging plan task, 77.4 percent of the annual plan, and 107.1 percent of the forest railway transport volume plan. Moreover, because the workers were fixed and labor productivity improved, costs were reduced. Before the implementation of year-round operation, the labor force required for every 10,000 cubic meters of logs was 184.8 people in 1951. After the implementation of year-round operation, the plan for 1953 was 102.1 people (including non-production personnel in the entire bureau), labor efficiency increased by 184 percent compared to 1951, and costs were also greatly reduced. In addition, we also carried out nurturing and renewal experiments, established forest nurseries and direct seeding, and implemented the policy of combining logging with nurturing, creating beautiful young forests on the barren mountains after logging.

    Year-round operation has led us to factoryization in production. Having monthly and quarterly production plans throughout the year allows us to more evenly complete the state's production tasks and reduce the rush and chaos in production. Moreover, due to year-round operation, the number of workers and tools required has been reduced, thus reducing huge expenses and increasing enterprise bonuses. This makes it possible for us to gradually improve the lives of workers, such as building bathhouses, laundries, buying straw mats, sleeping mats, work clothes, mosquito nets, raincoats, and thermos bottles for everyone, and actively helping workers build houses, settle down, and gradually establish the idea of long-term participation in forestry production.

    我们怎样取得了夏季作业的胜利
    带岭森林工业实验局局长　毕德育
    林业生产是处在相当辽阔而分散的大自然界里，进行露天作业，过去一直是靠天吃饭，进行季节性的生产。不论伐木和运搬，都只能在冬季进行。尤其是运搬作业，主要是依靠冰雪的自然滑力。因此，每年冬天就动员大批人马上山，有时人马上山早了，但未下雪，则人等雪；下雪早了，人还未上山，则雪等人。雪大了埋没产品，雪小了滑不动木材。这样，年年造成巨大的窝工和浪费。碰到雪下晚了，运搬期限缩短，就得大添人马，使整个冬季作业都处在突击的状态中，经常加班加点，顾不得质量的好坏和品级的区分，七长八短，不分树种地就垛起来（归楞），造成了业务上的混乱。等到春天冰雪融化的时候，人马便全部下山，我们的大部工作就被迫停止了。且由于伐木工人不能固定，每到入冬前，大量的招工买马，临时招来的工人大部是农民和城市贫民，生产技术不熟，工作效率不高，因而形成了浪费大，成本高，事故多，占用国家资金多。干一冬歇三季的作业方式，成为林区作业历史上的特点，也是森林工业发展的最大障碍。在经济建设急需木材的情况下，季节性的生产已无法满足国家的需要。
    为了改变季节性的作业方式，一九五○年，我们首先实行了“秋采冬运”，把作业季节拉长了一倍。实验成功了，接着准备进一步固定工人，进行常年作业。一九五一年，我们曾在计划里规定了夏季生产四万立方公尺的任务，但由于我们对条件估计不足，准备不充分，采伐了一万五千立方公尺木材，就继续不下去了，连采伐的木材也没有运下来，反而积压了国家大量资金。常年作业的尝试，遭受了这一打击后，引起了不少工人和技术人员的反对，他们说林业生产从来没有听说过常年作业。老
  一些的学林业的同志说：“就是苏联也只有部分常年作业，咱们那能比得上苏联的条件。”他们强调不能进行常年作业的原因是：林区里到了春夏天，天热雨多，蚊虫咬，运搬道路泥泞，不能行车走马。如果不克服这些不利的自然条件，就很难走向常年作业。但是我们决心要继续试验下去。
    一九五一年冬，我们继续试行常年作业，但是由于我们对常年作业的困难认识不足，没有找出适当办法来解决运搬的困难，又遭到第二次的失败。
    这次失败，使我们获得了有益的教训。为了解决常年作业的运搬困难，我们提出充分利用机械化、半机械化的运材工具，决定把简易森林铁路尽量延长，克服夏天用牛马运输木材、用人工捣背粮草的困难。我们开始在原红叶沟伐区修了五公里的简易森林铁路，实行这一措施的结果，比用牛马套子运搬木材每公里能节省运费三千二百十八元。
      一九五二年的秋天，辽东柳毛河林区伐木工人创造了运材先进工具，给常年作业提供了有利条件。我们当即派了五名技术人员和干部前往学习，后来又抽出伐木场长等十八名人员去学习。辽东的新式运材工具确实给常年作业开辟了宽阔的道路。但我们在推广新工具中又遇到保守思想的阻碍。有的人说辽东新工具不适合带岭的具体条件；也有的人不敢推广，他们怕推广不成反而造成浪费。发现这些情况后，我们就马上召开了伐木场长和技术人员的座谈会，及时消除了上述种种思想顾虑，并决定先推广有把握的经验，提倡发明创造，开展了推广和创造新工具的运动。第一伐木场先推广了辽东的双轴滑杠、单轴滑杠、木轨自动爬犁三种新式工具。推广不久，就发现了新的困难。有的人把推广新工具叫作“二够呛”，即使用单轴滑杠的时候，重载下山速度太快，吓的够呛；笨重的空车向高山推时，累的够呛。这时，我们就发动工人改进新工具。工人们首先改造了车体，使车体重量减轻了三分之一。接着，工人又创造了安全减速闸，把双轴滑杠改成铁式木式混合滑杠。第十伐木场工人又创造了木滑杠。这些工具的创造和改进，提高了效率，保证了安全，使得推广新工具运动顺利开展，为常年作业打下了有利的基础。
    我们又学习了苏联先进经验，进行伐区方格式的调查设计工作。经过调查，正确地掌握了林地面积、林木蓄积、地形、地物、土壤以及树材种等情况。然后根据调查，进行设计，如研究用什么工具运搬成本最低，在什么地点打吃水井，盖工舍，修牛棚等，编制出时间进度作业图。经过审查批准后，今年带岭林区十一个伐木场全部实行了常年作业。
    在进行常年作业的过程中，第一伐木场由于充分利用了自然条件，成绩最好。他们在冬季先开采远的，在畜力运搬上先由远处往回运，越拉越近，工人一天比一天容易达到定额，越干越有劲。他们又注意了各种自然条件，搬运木材时，在冬天先从夏天不能运或不好运的水甸子洼泥塘等处把木材运出来；乘着雪没化先拉向阳地方的木材，后拉背阴坡地方的（因为向阳地方化雪早，要比背阴坡早化雪二十多天）。他们还注意自然条件和地理条件，适当地灵活地使用新工具配合牛马套子，冬天仍多作冰道和雪道冰辙的运材道，提高运搬能力。这许多具体措施，使第一伐木场在今年顺利地实行了常年作业计划。
    一九五三年上半年，我们采取了这些办法，完成了采伐计划任务的百分之一百三十一，完成全年计划的百分之七十七点四，森林铁路的运输量完成计划的百分之一百零七点一。并且由于工人固定了，劳动生产率提高了，因而降低了成本。在实行常年作业以前，原木生产每万立方公尺所需劳动力，一九五一年为一八四·八人，在实行常年作业以后的一九五三年计划为一○二·一人（包括全局非生产人员），劳动效率比一九五一年提高百分之一百八十四，成本也大大降低。此外，我们还进行了抚育更新的实验，建立了林间苗圃与直播，实现了采伐结合抚育的方针，在伐后的光山上，营造了美好的幼林。
    常年作业使我们在生产上走向工厂化。一年到头都有月季的生产计划，使我们能够较均衡地完成国家的生产任务，减少了生产上的突击性和忙乱现象。而且，由于常年作业，需用的工人和工具都减少了，因此减少了庞大的开支，增加了企业奖励金。使得我们有条件逐步地改善工人生活，譬如修建澡堂、洗衣房，给每人买了草垫子、凉席、作业服、蚊帐、雨衣和热水瓶等，并且积极帮助工人修盖房屋，安家立业，逐渐树立起长期参加林业生产的思想。
