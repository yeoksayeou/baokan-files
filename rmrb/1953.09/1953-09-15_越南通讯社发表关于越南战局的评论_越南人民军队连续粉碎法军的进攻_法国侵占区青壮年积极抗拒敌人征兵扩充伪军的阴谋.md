Xinhua News Agency, September 14th: Vietnam News Agency recently published a commentary on the Vietnam War situation. The commentary said: Recently, according to the Navarre Plan, the French invading army, on the one hand, withdrew from the most fortified strongholds such as Na San and many other strongholds; on the other hand, it launched surprise attacks on the guerrilla base areas of the Vietnamese people, such as the guerrilla base areas between Hue and Quang Tri in central Vietnam, and used newly established puppet army battalions to carry out mopping-up operations in the southern part of Nam Dinh province and Quang Yen province near Haiphong in North Vietnam.

However, due to the heroic resistance of the People's Army local troops, militia, and guerrillas, the enemy has suffered heavy losses. In North Vietnam, the People's Army annihilated a large number of enemy troops in the southern part of Nam Dinh province. At the same time, they removed several important enemy strongholds in other places, including Van Tri in Hung Yen province, Van Dinh in Ha Dong province, and Tien Tien in Hai Duong province. The French army has also suffered continuous defeats in various parts of central and southern Vietnam.

The commentary then pointed out: The French colonialists are stepping up their efforts to gather more puppet troops to save their defeat. In the past few weeks, the enemy has continuously carried out large-scale forced conscription of puppet troops and issued a general mobilization order, using various intimidation methods to force all men between the ages of eighteen and forty-five to join the puppet army in order to piece together the fifty-four battalions of puppet troops that they have promised to their American masters.

However, because the youths and adults in the occupied areas are trying every means to deal with the enemy's forced conscription, the French invaders and their lackeys have still not been able to gather as much manpower as they need.

    越南人民军队连续粉碎法军的进攻
    法国侵占区青壮年积极抗拒敌人征兵扩充伪军的阴谋
    【新华社十四日讯】越南通讯社最近发表关于越南战局的评论。评论说：近来，法国侵略军根据纳瓦尔计划，一面撤离了最坚固的据点那产及其他许多据点；另一面对越南人民的游击战根据地如中越的顺化和广治间的游击战根据地进行突袭，并使用新成立的伪军营在北越南定省南部和海防附近的广安省进行扫荡。
    但是，由于人民军地方部队、民兵和游击队对敌军进行英勇的阻击，已使敌人受到严重的损失。在北越，人民军在南定省南部歼灭了大量敌军，同时，在其他地方拔除了几个重要的敌军据点，其中有兴安省的文治、河东省的文定和海阳省的仙仙。法军在中越和南越各地，也不断遭受着失败。
    评论接着指出：法国殖民者正在加紧搜罗更多的伪军来挽救他们的失败。在过去几星期中，敌人连续进行大规模强征伪军的工作，并发布总动员令，用各种恫吓威胁的办法，强迫年龄在十八岁到四十五岁之间的所有男子都去参加伪军，以便拼凑已向其美国主子保证要成立的五十四营伪军。
    但是，由于占领区的青壮年想尽一切办法来对付敌人的强行征兵，法国侵略者及其走狗还是没能够搜罗到他们所需要的那么多的人力。
