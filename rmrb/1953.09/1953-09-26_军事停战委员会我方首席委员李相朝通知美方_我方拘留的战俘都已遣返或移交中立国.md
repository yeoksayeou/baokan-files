Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 25th. Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao, Chief of the Korean-Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission, today informed Mr. Brian, the Chief of the US side, that all US personnel captured by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have either been directly repatriated or transferred to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for custody. The letter stated: "All of your personnel who were previously held by our side and were not directly repatriated were transferred to the custody of the Indian Custodial Forces of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on September 24, 1953. Therefore, our side no longer detains any of your captured personnel."

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 24th. On September 24th, the Korean-Chinese side handed over to the Indian Custodial Forces of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission UN prisoners of war held under custody who, despite repeated persuasion, were still unwilling to be repatriated, including 335 Koreans, 23 Americans, and 1 Briton. They were placed under custody at Songgok-ri, in the northern half of the demilitarized zone west of Panmunjom. The entire handover operation began at 10:00 AM and ended at 1:00 PM.

The UN side claimed that on September 23rd, it had handed over approximately 7,800 Korean People's Army prisoners of war and approximately 14,700 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who were unwilling to be directly repatriated to the Indian Custodial Forces for custody at Dongchang-ri, in the southern half of the demilitarized zone south of Panmunjom.

According to the provisions of the "Terms of Reference for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," representatives of the countries to which the prisoners of war belong will soon begin explaining their rights to all prisoners of war affiliated with those countries and notifying them of any matters related to their return home, especially their complete freedom to return home and live a peaceful life. However, even before the explanation work began, some Korean-Chinese prisoners of war, disregarding the threats from Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee's agents who had infiltrated the prisoners of war under the prior arrangement of the US side, rushed out of the ranks upon seeing the Korean-Chinese observer representatives during the handover process by the Indian Custodial Forces, or slipped out of their tents in the middle of the night after the takeover by the Indian Custodial Forces, seeking Indian sentries to demand immediate repatriation. As of September 23rd, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission had repatriated 22 Korean People's Army prisoners of war and 5 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war to the Korean-Chinese side.

According to the complaints of the aforementioned returning Korean-Chinese prisoners of war to the Korean-Chinese side, representatives of the Indian Custodial Forces, and reporters from both sides in Panmunjom, the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee gangs, under the direct instruction and assistance of the US side, and disregarding the provisions of the "Terms of Reference for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and the repeated warnings from the Korean-Chinese side, dispatched a large number of agents posing as Korean-Chinese prisoners of war unwilling to be directly repatriated to carry out their special agent rule conspiracy in the prisoner-of-war camps under the jurisdiction of the Indian Custodial Forces, undermine the custody of the Indian Custodial Forces and the explanation work soon to be started by the Korean-Chinese explanation representatives, and are using force to obstruct the repatriation of Korean-Chinese prisoners of war. The Korean-Chinese side is paying close attention to this serious violation of the armistice agreement.

    军事停战委员会我方首席委员李相朝通知美方
    我方拘留的战俘都已遣返或移交中立国
    【新华社开城二十五日电】军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将今天通知美方首席委员勃里安说，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军拘留的全部美方被俘人员，或已直接遣返，或已移交给中立国遣返委员会看管。信中说：“先前由我方看管的你方不直接遣返被俘人员已在一九五三年九月二十四日全部移交给中立国遣返委员会印度看管部队看管。因此，我方现已不再拘留有你方任何被俘人员。”
    【新华社开城二十四日电】九月二十四日朝中方面将它收容下屡经劝说但仍不愿遣返的联合国军被俘人员，计：朝鲜籍三百三十五名，美籍二十三名，英籍一名，释交中立国遣返委员会的印度看管部队，在板门店以西非军事区北半部内的松谷里予以看管。整个交给工作于上午十时开始至下午一时结束。
    联合国军方面声称：它已于九月二十三日将不直接遣返的朝鲜人民军被俘人员约七千八百名及中国人民志愿军被俘人员约一万四千七百名释交印度看管部队，在板门店以南非军事区南半部内的东场里予以看管。
    根据“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的规定，战俘所属国家的代表，即将开始向一切依附于该所属国的战俘解释他们的权利，并通知他们任何有关他们回返家乡的事项，特别是他们有回家过和平生活的完全自由。但即在解释工作开始以前，已有若干朝中被俘人员不顾美方事先布置混入战俘中的蒋介石与李承晚的特务的威胁，在印度看管部队接管过程中，看到朝中观察代表而冲出队伍，或在印度看管部队接管后半夜溜出帐篷，寻找印度哨兵要求即予遣返。截至九月二十三日止，由中立国遣返委员会遣交朝中方面的有朝鲜人民军被俘人员二十二名，中国人民志愿军被俘人员五名。
    根据归来的上述朝中被俘人员向朝中方面、印度看管部队代表以及双方在板门店的记者的申诉表明：蒋介石、李承晚匪帮在美方的直接指使与协助下，不顾“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的规定，与朝中方面事先一再的警告，派遣了大批特务冒充不直接遣返的朝中被俘人员，在印度看管部队管辖下的战俘营内实行其特务统治阴谋，破坏印度看管部队的看管和朝中解释代表即将开始的解释工作，并正以武力威胁阻挠朝中被俘人员的遣返，对于这一严重违反停战协定的情况，朝中方面正予以密切的注意。
