What Do the Budgets of Capitalist Countries Show?
Nikitin, Soviet Union

The working people of our motherland and all progressive humanity unanimously praise the recently approved 1953 Soviet national budget and the budgets of the various republics.

Every clause and every figure in the new Soviet budget and the budgets of the republics irrefutably demonstrates the Party and government's tireless concern for expanding and improving socialist production and continuously raising the living standards of the working people.

The main share of the revenue portion of the new Soviet state budget comes from the socialist economy, and compared with the 1952 budget, income from taxes and voluntary contributions from residents is reduced.

In the expenditure portion of the budget, it is stipulated to greatly expand investment in the national economy and increase allocations for social and cultural measures and residential construction.

The 1953 Soviet budget is a budget for peaceful construction. It is a clear testament to the continuous improvement of our people's living standards on the basis of peaceful economic development, and a guarantee of more complete and multifaceted satisfaction of the ever-growing material and cultural needs of the working people of socialist society.

The budgets of capitalist countries, however, reflect a completely different situation.

Not long ago, the major capitalist countries announced the results of the previous fiscal year's national budget execution and conducted parliamentary debates on the draft budgets for the new year that has already begun.

The dry figures in all these budgets and drafts unequivocally illustrate the extraordinary economic tensions caused by the pursuit of a policy of arms expansion and war preparation by the countries of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc. These figures illustrate the national financial crises of capitalist countries, and the unprecedentedly heavy burdens imposed on the working people by the ruling groups in order to enrich a small handful of monopoly capitalists.

From the officially published budget materials, we can draw some conclusions about the policy of unrestricted arms race and "Cold War."

Due to the excessive expansion of military spending by the aggressive bloc, the current military spending of the United States, Britain, and France has increased by one to three times compared with the 1949-1950 budget year before the American armed intervention in Korea, and by tens of times compared with before World War II.

Even from the officially published budget figures, military spending in the expenditure portions of the United States, Britain, and France has reached 73 percent, 42 percent, and 33 percent respectively.

Such is the appalling degree of financial militarization in several major capitalist countries. The entire structure of the budgets proves that their main direction is to raise funds for aggression and expansion plans. These are militarized budgets, "Cold War" budgets, which, in order to excessively expand military preparations, have in fact reduced allocations for the peaceful needs of residents to near zero. For example, due to this financial policy of the U.S. ruling groups, the number of hospital beds in the United States has decreased by 282,000 from 1945 to 1952, and the number of medical institutions in various states has also decreased by 20 to 25 percent.

During the same period, $4.5 billion was spent on building barracks and other housing needed for the U.S. military forces. That is, several times more than the total amount of allocations for education, health, and social security stipulated in the 1953-1954 budget.

The national budgets of capitalist countries clearly demonstrate such an anti-people financial policy, which is being shamelessly used by the ruling groups to ensure that monopoly capitalists obtain maximum profits.

At present, the burden of taxation in capitalist countries has reached an historically unprecedented level, because these countries rely on increasing taxes and exorbitant taxes on the people to pay for huge military expenditures.

In recent years, the tax revenues of those major capitalist countries have far exceeded the highest point ever reached during the war years of 1944-1945. In the United States in 1952, tax revenue accounted for 30 percent of national income; France accounted for 39 percent; and Britain accounted for 42 percent.

Such huge tax revenues are mainly squeezed from the low-wage strata of the residents, because whether it is raising tax rates and drastically increasing the number of income tax payers, or excessively increasing indirect taxes, all of these are, as Lenin said, the most unfair exorbitant taxes imposed on the poor people.

Indirect taxes have reached an unprecedented amount in all taxation, with indirect taxes accounting for 40 percent of total tax revenue in the United States; Britain—44 percent; West Germany—60 percent; France—75 percent; and Italy—84 percent.

As tax rates increased, the direct taxes falling on workers in the U.S. processing industry at the beginning of 1953 increased by an average of 36 times compared with the eve of World War II.

The result of the significant increase in direct and indirect taxes in the United States and other capitalist countries is that the laborers in these countries have to pay no less than one-third of their nominal wages to the tax authorities.

Although the tax squeeze machine has been tightened to the extreme, the ruling classes of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc are still unable to offset the huge military expenditures with tax revenues. Therefore, the growing budget deficits, which are sufficient to prove the state of national financial crisis, have become a characteristic of these countries.

The budget deficit for the U.S. 1952-1953 budget year, which ended not long ago, reached $9.4 billion, which is 1.3 times higher than the budget deficit for the previous year. The American press pointed out that such a huge budget deficit, which has never occurred in peacetime in American history, was completely unexpected even by American financial groups and politicians. The U.S. 1953-1954 budget also stipulates a deficit of more than $5 billion. However, from some statements by U.S. congressmen, it can be seen that in reality, the U.S. deficit for the coming year will greatly exceed these stipulated figures, reaching $9 billion to $10 billion.

In Britain, as a result of the arms race, the budget deficit for the past 1952-1953 budget year was 521 million pounds; but the approved budget for that year originally stipulated that income should exceed expenditure. The new British 1953-1954 budget has directly stipulated a deficit of 580 million pounds.

The situation in France is even worse. In 1952, the French budget deficit was more than 800 billion francs, and the draft budget for 1953 has already explicitly stipulated that expenditure exceeds income by 906 billion francs, accounting for almost a quarter of the total budget expenditure.

Therefore, if the governments of those capitalist countries previously sought to balance their budgets, they now have to abandon their illusions and simply stipulate huge deficits when preparing their budgets.

However, using the issuance of public bonds and securities to make up for budget deficits will cause these countries to be heavily indebted, increase the amount of currency in circulation, cause currency depreciation, further deepen inflation, and thus cause the prices of necessities for the working people to continue to rise.

The amount of currency in circulation in the United States is now more than four times higher than before the war; Britain—twice; France—twenty times.

This proves that the ruling classes of various capitalist countries are universally adopting large-scale inflation measures in order to enrich themselves and lower the living standards of the masses of the people.

In the first half of 1953, the profits of various companies in the United States, even taking into account the decline in the purchasing power of the dollar, exceeded the pre-war level by five times!

During the same period, real wages in the United States, even taking into account the increase in labor intensity, decreased by 30 percent compared with the pre-war level; in Britain, it decreased by 33 percent; and in France and Italy, it decreased by nearly 50 percent. These are the measures of the absolute poverty of the working people. The decline in the share of the national income accounted for by the working people also relatively proves their poverty: as early as 1951, the income of residents in the United States who lived on wages only accounted for 41.9 percent of the total national income; in comparison, it was 44.3 percent in 1948 and 47.4 percent in 1940. The share of wages in the national income in West Germany fell by 8 percent in the period from 1950 to 1952 alone.

The further impoverishment of the working masses, the reduction of their purchasing power, and the sharp reduction in the consumption of food and other necessities—these are the consequences of the notorious economic militarization and "Cold War" policies.

Therefore, the voices of protest against the policies forced by the American aggressive bloc, that is, the disastrous war policies pursued by the countries of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, have become louder and louder. The resistance of the masses of the people to the American militarist plan is growing. The will of hundreds of millions of people who yearn for peace has become a powerful practical force.

    资本主义各国的预算说明了什么
    苏联  尼基丁
    我们祖国的劳动人民和全体进步人类，一致盛赞不久前被批准的一九五三年度苏联国家预算和各加盟共和国的预算。
    新的苏联预算和各加盟共和国预算的每一项条款和每一个数字，都无可辩驳地表明了党和政府对于扩大与改进社会主义生产以及不断提高劳动人民生活的不倦关怀。
    苏维埃国家新预算收入部分的主要份额，是来自社会主义经济，和一九五二年预算比较，来自纳税和居民自愿缴纳的收入是减少了。
    在预算的支出部分中，规定要大大地扩大对国民经济的投资和在社会文化措施与住宅建筑方面的拨款。
    一九五三年的苏联预算是和平建设的预算。它是在和平经济发展的基础上不断提高我国人民生活水平的明证，是更完全地多方面满足社会主义社会劳动者不断增长的物质与文化需要的保证。
    资本主义各国的预算却反映了完全不同的另一种情况。
    不久以前，各主要资本主义国家公布了上一财政年度国家预算执行的结果，并就业已开始的新的年度的预算草案进行了议会辩论。
    所有这些预算和草案中的干燥数字，都确凿地说明北大西洋侵略集团各国由于奉行扩军备战政策在经济上所造成的异常紧张状态。这些数字说明资本主义各国的国家财政危机，说明统治集团为了使一小撮垄断资本家们发财而加于劳动人民身上的空前沉重负担。
    从官方发表的预算材料中，我们可以对进行无限制的军备竞赛与“冷战”政策作出一些结论。
    由于侵略集团过分扩大军费支出，现在美、英、法三国的军费支出已比一九四九—一九五○预算年度美国武装干涉朝鲜以前增加一至三倍，而比第二次世界大战以前增加了数十倍。
    即使从官方发表的预算数字看来，在美、英、法三国的预算支出部分中，军费支出已分别达到了百分之七十三，百分之四十二和百分之三十三。
    几个主要资本主义国家的财政军事化的骇人听闻的程度就是如此。各国预算的整个结构，证明了它们的主要方针是为侵略和扩张计划筹款。这是军事化的预算，“冷战”的预算，它们为了过度扩大军事备战的支出，事实上已将对于居民和平需要的拨款减少到接近于零。举例来说，由于美国统治集团的这种财政政策，从一九四五年到一九五二年这一段期间，美国医院的病床床位已减少了二十八万二千个，而各州的医疗机构也减少了百分之二十到二十五。
    在同一期间，为建盖营房和兵营以及其他为美国军事部队所需的房屋的款项，却支出了四十五亿美元。也就是说，比一九五三—一九五四年预算中所规定的用于教育、卫生与社会保险事业拨款的总数还多出好几倍。
    资本主义各国的国家预算清楚地表明了这样一个反人民的财政方针，这个预算正被统治集团无耻地用来保证垄断资本家们取得最大限度的利润。
    目前在资本主义国家内赋税的负担已经达到了历史上空前未有的奇重程度，因为这些国家是依靠了增大税收和对人民的苛捐杂税来支付庞大的军事开支的。
    近几年以来，那些主要的资本主义国家的税收额已远远地超过战时一九四四—一九四五年度所曾经达到的最高点。在美国一九五二年的税收已占国民收入的百分之三十；法国占百分之三十九；英国占百分之四十二。
    这样巨额的税收主要是从居民中的低薪阶层搜括来的，因为无论是用提高税率和急剧增大所得税缴纳者的人数，或是过分提高间接税，所有这些都是，正如列宁所说，加之于穷苦人民身上的最不公道的苛税。
    间接税在所有课税中达到了前所未闻的数额，美国的间接税占整个税收的百分之四十；英国——百分之四十四；西德——百分之六十；法国——百分之七十五；意大利——百分之八十四。
    随着税率的提高，一九五三年初落在美国加工工业工人身上的直接税较之第二次世界大战前夜平均增加了三十六倍。
    美国和其它资本主义国家的直接税和间接税显著增加的结果，使这些国家的劳动者不得不向税收机关缴纳不下于自己名义工资三分之一的税款。
    虽然税收压榨机已被扭紧到了极点，但是北大西洋侵略集团的统治阶层仍然不能以税收来抵补庞大的军事开支，因此，足以证明国家财政危机状况的日益增长的预算赤字已成为这些国家的特征。
    不久前结束的美国一九五二—一九五三预算年度的预算赤字曾达到了九十四亿美元，这比前一年度的预算赤字超出了一点三倍。美国报刊指出，在美国历史中和平时期所从未有过的这样巨大的预算赤字，甚至完全出乎美国金融集团及政界人士的意料之外。一九五三—一九五四年度的美国预算也规定了五十亿美元以上的赤字。但从美国国会议员的一些声明中可以看出，实际上美国来年度的赤字将会大大超出这些规定的数字，而达到九十至一百亿美元。
    在英国，由于军备竞赛的结果，过去的一九五二—一九五三年度的预算赤字为五亿二千一百万英镑；但该年度批准的预算原是规定了收入要超过支出的。英国一九五三—一九五四年度的新预算已经直截了当地规定了赤字是五亿八千万英镑。
    法国的境况更形恶化，一九五二年法国预算赤字在八千亿法郎以上，而一九五三年的预算草案上已预先明文规定支出超过收入达九千零六十亿法郎，几乎占整个预算支出的四分之一。
    因此，如果说从前那些资本主义国家的政府还企求平衡预算的话，那么现在他们已经不得不放弃幻想而在编制预算时干脆规定庞大的赤字了。
    然而，用发行公债及有价证券弥补预算赤字，这就要引起这些国家债台高筑，增加货币流通额，造成货币贬值，更加加深通货膨胀，从而引起劳动人民生活必需品价格的不断上涨。
    现在美国的货币流通额较之战前几乎增加了四倍多；英国——两倍；法国——二十倍。
    这证明了各资本主义国家的统治阶层为了自己的发财致富，而降低人民群众的生活水准，正普遍地采取很大规模的通货膨胀的手段。
    一九五三年上半年美国各个公司的利润，甚至连美元购买力的降低估计在内，已超过了战前水平的五倍！
    同一时期内美国的实际工资，连劳动强度的增长估计在内，较战前水平降低了百分之三十；在英国降低了百分之三十三；在法国和意大利降低了接近百分之五十。这些就是劳动人民绝对贫困的尺度。国民收入中劳动人民所占份额的下降也相对地证明了他们的贫困：早在一九五一年，美国依靠工薪糊口的居民的收入额，只占全部国民收入的百分之四十一点九；与此相比，一九四八年是百分之四十四点三，一九四○年是百分之四十七点四。西德的工资在国民收入中所占的份额，仅在一九五○到一九五二年这一时期中便下落了百分之八。
    劳动群众的进一步贫穷，他们购买力的缩减，食物和其他生活必需品的消费的锐减——这些就是臭名昭彰的经济军事化和“冷战”政策所造成的后果。
    因此，反对美国侵略集团所强迫实行的政策，即北大西洋侵略集团各国所奉行的遭致覆灭的战争政策的抗议呼声，已愈来愈响亮了。人民群众对美国军国主义计划的反抗正在日益增长。千百万人向往和平的意志已成为一个强大的实际力量。
