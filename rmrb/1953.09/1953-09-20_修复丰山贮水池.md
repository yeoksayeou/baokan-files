    Repairing the Fengshan Reservoir
    Zhi Wen
    "The construction site is the battlefield, the flood is our enemy, and repairing the reservoir is another new victory in the struggle against American imperialism." This is the battle cry of the Chinese and Korean People's troops participating in the construction of the Fengshan Reservoir in Korea, which was destroyed by American aircraft. They fought side by side against a common enemy on the battlefield, and now they are working side by side in the rear to rebuild homes for the Korean people and heal the wounds of war.
    The Fengshan Reservoir is located in Guicheng County, North Pyongan Province, Korea. It is a large reservoir that can irrigate approximately 391,000 mu of land. In the past, under its irrigation, this area could harvest 48,000 tons of rice every year. Therefore, nearby farmers proudly call it "our granary of harvest."
    Starting from June 13th, American aircraft continuously and barbarously bombed this peaceful construction project of the Korean people, severely damaging the dam and causing profound disasters for the Korean people.
    This incident immediately aroused new hatred among the Volunteer Army soldiers towards the aggressors and caused them to have deeper sympathy for the Korean people. On July 5th, 4,000 Volunteer Army soldiers joined the work of building the Fengshan Reservoir. They and 2,000 Korean People's Army soldiers formed a huge commando team and launched a fierce struggle against the flood side by side.
    The Volunteer Army soldiers who participated in the dam construction carried mud and transported earth under the scorching sun, working for more than eight or nine hours a day. However, their spirit was cheerful. They sang:
    "The construction site is the battlefield,
    Tools are weapons. …
    Digging soil with a shovel is like killing the enemy,
    We must send the American devils back home. …
    Carry the soil to the dam,
    To crush Eisenhower and Syngman Rhee!"
    Colorful flags fluttered everywhere, and the clear voice of the broadcaster resounded everywhere. While carrying soil, they used loudspeakers to broadcast, commend models, spread experiences, and share good news. The leaders of the Volunteer Army units and cadres at all levels of the Korean People's Government attached great importance to and cared about the construction project. They often came to the construction site to understand the situation and direct the progress of the project.
    On July 12th, the emergency repair command post suddenly received a weather report from Pyongyang: there would be heavy rain from July 15th to July 20th. The command post predicted that floods were coming; however, the gap in the dam had not been filled. If the flood came, the newly built dam would definitely be washed away; 391,000 mu of fertile paddy fields would be flooded; the lives and property of the vast number of farmers in this area would suffer terrible disasters. When the soldiers heard this news, they all immediately expressed their determination to the leaders and asked for night work to rush the repairs. So they worked with torches lit at night. When enemy planes came, they extinguished the torches, and the construction site was pitch black, and the enemy planes couldn't find anything; as soon as the enemy planes left, countless bright torches were lit again. When the heavy rain came, they still stubbornly persisted in rushing to repair the unfinished project. Finally, the flood did come, and the water level rose by one meter in the first hour. However, a dam about 400 meters long steadily blocked the rising flood.
    In just half a month, the Volunteer Army soldiers and the Korean People's Army soldiers together completely repaired the dam destroyed by the enemy, and built the dam more solid than before. The flood was tamed and calmed in front of it, and once again became the wealth of the people.
    On the afternoon of July 20th, the Chinese and Korean soldiers raised the hoes and shovels in their hands high on the dam, joyfully celebrating the victory of the emergency repair project. This earth-shattering cheer was a demonstration of the power of the Chinese and Korean people, who are firmly united, to the aggressors.
    On the same afternoon, a grand completion ceremony of the Fengshan Reservoir was held. At the meeting, a letter from Premier Kim Il-sung to all commanders and combatants of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army units participating in the dam construction was read. The letter said:
    “…The friendship and unity of the Korean and Chinese people, forged with blood, has become a force that overcomes all difficulties and is forever victorious. Today's achievement in successfully completing the construction of the reservoir in a short period of time, regardless of all difficulties, marks another new victory for us against the enemy, and it will shine forever together with the monument that will be built on the reservoir. …”
    Li Xiangrong, Vice Minister of Agriculture of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, personally presented a flag to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army unit participating in the dam construction at the meeting. The flag read:
    "The Korean people will never forget your labor contributions in the construction of the Fengshan Reservoir project, which was barbarously bombed by American imperialist aircraft."
    Local farmers also presented flags to the Volunteer Army comrades, and wrote their infinite gratitude for the Volunteer Army's help in establishing a happy life on the flag:
    "Your achievements will forever shine on the Fengshan Reservoir." (Attached picture)

### 修复丰山贮水池

    修复丰山贮水池
    志文
    “工地就是阵地，洪水就是我们的敌人，修好贮水池就是对美帝国主义斗争的又一次新的胜利。”这是参加修建被美国飞机破坏的朝鲜丰山贮水池的中朝人民部队的战斗口号。他们在战场上并肩打击了共同的敌人，现在，他们又在后方并肩为朝鲜人民重建家园，医治战争创伤而工作着。
    丰山贮水池在朝鲜平安北道龟城郡境内，是一个能灌溉大约三十九万一千亩土地的大贮水池。往年在它的灌溉下，这一带地区每年可以收四万八千吨稻子。因此，附近的农民都骄傲地把它叫做“我们的丰收仓”。
    从六月十三日开始，美国飞机曾连续地对这个朝鲜人民的和平建设工程进行野蛮的轰炸，严重地破坏了堤坝，使朝鲜人民遭到了深重的灾难。
    这件事立刻激起了志愿军战士们对侵略者的新的仇恨，并且引起了他们对朝鲜人民的更加深切的同情。七月五日，四千名志愿军战士参加了修建丰山贮水池的工作。他们和二千名朝鲜人民军战士们结成了一支庞大的突击队，并肩向洪水展开了猛烈的斗争。
    参加修坝的志愿军战士们，在烈日下背泥运土，每天坚持八、九个小时以上的工作。然而他们的精神是愉快的。他们唱着：
    “工地是阵地，
    工具是武器。……
    铁锹挖土好像把敌杀，
    一定要把美国鬼子送回老家。……
    把土运到水坝前，
    压死艾森豪威尔和李承晚！”
    这里到处飘扬着彩旗，到处响彻着广播员的明朗的声音，他们一边背土，一边用喇叭筒广播，表扬模范，传播经验和好消息。志愿军部队的首长们和朝鲜人民政府的各级干部们对修建工程非常重视和关怀，他们经常到工地来了解情况和指挥工程的进行。
    七月十二日，抢修指挥所忽然接到了平壤来的气象报告：七月十五日到七月二十日将下大雨。指挥所预料洪水即将来临；然而堤坝上的缺口还没有填好，如果洪水一来，新修的堤坝一定要被冲毁；三十九万一千亩肥沃的稻田将被洪水淹没；这一带地区广大农民的生命财产，将遭到可怕的灾害。战士们听到了这个消息，大家都立刻向首长表示决心，要求夜间加工抢修。于是他们就在夜间打起火把来工作。敌机来时他们就熄灭火把，工地漆黑一片，敌机什么也找不到；敌机一走，无数的明亮的火把又燃起来了。当大雨来临时，他们仍然顽强地坚持着抢修未完成的工程。最后，洪水果然来了，第一小时水位就高涨一公尺。但是一条长约四百多公尺的堤坝稳稳当当地挡住了暴涨的洪水。
    仅仅半个月的时间，志愿军战士们和朝鲜人民军战士们一起，就全部修复了被敌人破坏的堤坝，而且把堤坝修筑得比过去更坚固。洪水在它面前驯服而平静，重新又变成了人民的财富。
    七月二十日下午，中朝战士们在坝上高举起手中的镐锹，尽情欢呼抢修工程的胜利，这种响彻大地的欢呼声，就是牢牢团结的中朝人民力量对侵略者的示威。
    当天下午，隆重地举行了丰山贮水池完工典礼。会上宣读了金日成首相给参加修坝的中国人民志愿军部队全体指挥员和战斗员的信，信上说：
    “……以血凝成的朝中人民历史的友谊团结，已经成为克服一切困难，永胜不败的力量。今天不顾一切困难，在短时期内成功地完成了修建贮水池的业绩，是标志了我们对敌人的又一次新的胜利，它将和那将要在贮水池上建立起来的纪念碑一同永放光芒。……”
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国农业省副相李相容并亲自在会上向参加修坝的中国人民志愿军部队献旗。旗上写着：
    “在修建被美帝国主义飞机野蛮轰炸所破坏了的丰山贮水池工程中，你们的劳动功勋是朝鲜人民永远不会忘记的。”
    当地农民也向志愿军同志们献旗，并把他们对志愿军帮助他们建立幸福生活的无限感激写在旗上：
    “你们的功勋永远照耀在丰山贮水池上”。（附图片）
