	National Comprehensive University Conference Opens
	Discussing the Direction, Tasks, and Training Objectives of Comprehensive Universities

[By this newspaper] The first National Comprehensive University Conference, convened by the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government, opened in Beijing on September 10th. The main tasks of this conference are to discuss the direction, tasks, and training objectives of comprehensive universities; and to discuss the establishment of departments and specialties, the division of labor among the schools, as well as teaching plans, teacher training, and scientific research. In order to further implement the spirit of learning from the Soviet Union in carrying out teaching reform, the conference will also exchange experiences in teaching reform over the past year. Attending the conference were Pan Zinian, Director of the Central South Bureau of Higher Education; Han Ming, Director of the Southwest Bureau of Higher Education; Li Zhiqin, Director of the Northwest Education Bureau; Chen Wangdao, Director of the East China Bureau of Higher Education; as well as Ma Yinchu, President of Peking University, and Vice Presidents Jiang Longji and Tang Yongtong; Yang Shixian, Vice President of Nankai University; Lü Zhenyu, President of Northeast People's University; Tong Dizhou and Lu Kanru, Vice Presidents of Shandong University; Pan Shu, President of Nanjing University, and Vice President Sun Shuping; Li Zhengwen, Vice President of Fudan University; Wang Yanan, President of Xiamen University; Li Da, President of Wuhan University; Feng Naichao, Vice President of Sun Yat-sen University; Dai Boxing, Vice President of Sichuan University; Li Guangtian, Vice President of Yunnan University; Hou Wailu, President of Northwest University; and Lin Disheng, President of Lanzhou University, and Vice President Chen Shiwei, totaling one hundred and eight people.

	On the first day of the conference, Huang Songling, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Higher Education, delivered a report on behalf of Minister Ma Xulun regarding the direction and tasks of comprehensive universities. The report first reviewed the work of the past year since the restructuring of departments and faculties, and affirmed the achievements of this restructuring. Since most institutions of higher learning, on the basis of ideological remolding of teachers last year, carried out the restructuring of departments and faculties, the establishment of specialties, and teaching reforms, they have reorganized the old-style ordinary universities with their complex departments, generalist majors, unclear teaching policies, and vague training objectives into new types of specialized colleges and comprehensive universities in engineering, agriculture, medicine, teacher training, finance and economics, political science and law, and the arts, so that each has its own responsibilities, division of labor and cooperation, and cultivates various specialized talents who are both academically sound and morally upright and suitable for national construction needs, and gradually completes a new system of higher education that combines advanced Soviet experience with China's actual conditions, which is entirely correct. At the same time, it was pointed out that there were overly hasty shortcomings in the restructuring of departments and faculties. In some aspects, too many projects were started without sufficient prior preparation, resulting in some colleges and universities not being able to be enriched, while the strength of individual comprehensive universities after the restructuring was weakened. At the same time, the historical advantages and departmental characteristics of some universities and their own actual needs were not taken into account during the restructuring, so that the academic foundation that had been accumulated over many years and that could represent the characteristics of the school was affected. In some comprehensive universities, too many specialized courses or short-term training courses of a secondary technical nature were held, which increased the extra burden on teachers, affected undergraduate teaching, and further blurred the view of comprehensive universities. In the allocation of teachers and equipment, some places have also failed to plan and allocate rationally in accordance with the nature and tasks of comprehensive universities and various specialized colleges. The report also pointed out that there are currently two important problems in comprehensive universities: one is the insufficient number and quality of science teachers, and poor equipment, which should be gradually strengthened; and the other is that the liberal arts and law departments urgently need to be reorganized and reformed, conditions should be created, and preparations should be made for development. Ideological leadership should be strengthened for teachers, and the work of uniting and transforming them should be done well, so as to give full play to their potential strength. As for the tasks of comprehensive universities, the focus is on cultivating talents in natural sciences and social sciences, who can engage in scientific research and serve as teachers in colleges and universities and secondary schools. The characteristics of comprehensive universities are: first, they focus more on general and specialized theoretical education than various specialized institutions of higher learning, so as to cultivate talents who can independently and creatively conduct research work, so that they can gradually solve certain theoretical and practical problems in their professional fields on the basis of Marxist-Leninist methodology. Second, a comprehensive university is a teaching institution, but it is also a research institution, and its teaching work is based on scientific research work. Therefore, comprehensive universities should be the foundation of various specialized institutions of higher learning and various scientific research institutions, and are a symbol of national culture and scientific development. The report finally emphasized that learning from advanced Soviet experience is the basic policy of comprehensive university education. However, this is the direction of our long-term efforts and cannot be fully realized in the short term. The report also explained the future work of comprehensive universities, such as the establishment of specialties, the revision of teaching plans, the training of teachers, and scientific research.

	From September 11th, Zeng Zhaolun, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Higher Education, will deliver a report on the division of key specialties and the revision of teaching plans, and Zhang Bochuan, Director of the Comprehensive University Education Department of the Ministry of Higher Education, will introduce the situation of university education and scientific research in the Soviet Union. Responsible comrades from the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council will also give instructions and reports to the meeting. The meeting will also discuss the above-mentioned reports.

    全国综合大学会议开幕
    讨论综合大学的方针、任务和培养目标
    【本报讯】中央人民政府高等教育部召开的第一次全国综合大学会议，九月十日在北京举行。这次会议的主要任务是讨论综合大学的方针、任务和培养目标；讨论科系和专业的设置、各校的分工以及教学计划、培养师资、科学研究等问题。为了进一步贯彻学习苏联进行教学改革的精神，会议并将交流一年来教学改革的经验。出席这次会议的有中南高等教育局局长潘梓年、西南高等教育局局长韩明、西北教育局局长李之钦、华东高等教育局局长陈望道，以及北京大学校长马寅初、副校长江隆基和汤用彤，南开大学副校长杨石先，东北人民大学校长吕振羽，山东大学副校长童第周和陆侃如，南京大学校长潘菽、副校长孙叔平，复旦大学副校长李正文，厦门大学校长王亚南，武汉大学校长李达，中山大学副校长冯乃超，四川大学副校长戴伯行，云南大学副校长李广田，西北大学校长侯外庐，兰州大学校长林迪生、副校长陈时伟等一百零八人。
  会议第一天由中央高等教育部黄松龄副部长代马叙伦部长作了关于综合大学的方针和任务的报告。报告中首先检查了院系调整后一年来的工作，肯定了院系调整工作的成绩。多数高等学校在去年教师思想改造的基础上进行院系调整、专业设置和教学改革工作以来，将院系庞杂、专业笼统、教学方针不明、培养目标不清的旧式普通大学，按科系性质和任务的不同，分别调整为新型的工、农、医、师范、财经、政法、艺术等专科学院和综合大学，以便各有专责，分工合作，培养适合国家建设需要的学用一致和德才兼备的各种专门人材，逐步完成以苏联先进经验与中国实际情况相结合的高等教育的新体系，这是完全正确的。同时又指出，在院系调整时，有过急的毛病，在某些方面摆的摊子过多，而事前的准备又不足，以致使某些院校不能充实起来，而调整后的个别综合大学的力量则被削弱了。同时，在调整时没有照顾到某些大学的历史优点和科系特点及其本身的实际需要，使其多年积累起来的能代表该校特点的学术基础受到影响。在某些综合大学里过多地举办了工科性质的专修科或中等技术性质和短期性的训练班，加重了教师们的额外负担，影响了本科的教学，也更模糊了对综合大学的看法。在师资和设备的调配上，有的地方也没有完全能够按照综合大学和各种专科院校的性质和任务，统盘筹划，作合理的调配。报告又指出，目前综合大学存在着两个重要问题：一是理科的师资不足，质量不齐，设备也差，应逐步加强；一是文法科急待整顿改革，创造条件，准备发展，对教师应加强思想领导，作好团结改造工作，以发挥其潜在力量。至于综合大学的任务，侧重培养自然科学和社会科学方面的人材，这种人材能够从事科学研究工作和作高等学校、中等学校的师资。综合大学的特点是：第一，比各种专科性的高等学校更着重于一般性的和专门性的理论教育，以便培养能独立地、创造性地进行研究工作的人材，使他们能够逐渐在马克思列宁主义方法论的基础上解决自己专业方面某些理论和实际问题。第二，综合大学是一个教学机构，但同时也是一个研究机构，它的教学工作是建立在科学研究工作的基础上的。因此，综合大学应该是各种专科性高等学校和各种科学研究机构的基础，是国家文化和科学发展的标志。报告最后着重指出，学习苏联先进经验，是综合大学教育的基本方针。但这是我们长期努力的方向，并不是在短期内所能完全实现的。对今后综合大学的工作，如专业设置、修订教学计划、培养师资和科学研究等问题，也作了说明。
    全国综合大学会议十一日起将由中央高等教育部副部长曾昭抡作关于专业设置重点分工及修订教学计划的报告，由中央高等教育部综合大学教育司司长张勃川介绍苏联大学教育和科学研究工作的情况。政务院文化教育委员会负责同志也将对会议作指示和报告。会议并将就上述几个报告进行讨论。
