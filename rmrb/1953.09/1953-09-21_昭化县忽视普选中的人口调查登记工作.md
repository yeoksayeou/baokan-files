    Zhaohua County Neglects Population Survey and Registration Work in General Election
    Reader Shuang Ren's letter: Zhaohua County, Sichuan Province, did not do a good job in the population survey and registration work for the general election. Zhang Peilong, Deputy Secretary of the Zhaohua County Party Committee (Chairman of the County Election Committee), said: "Population survey and registration work does not necessarily need to be emphasized; doing a good job in the general election is equivalent to doing the population survey and registration work." County Magistrate Yang Kunshan said: "Population registration cannot achieve no duplication and no omissions; it's good enough if it achieves 80 or 90 percent accuracy." Because leading cadres have an unclear understanding of the significance and purpose of population survey and registration work and do not pay attention to this work, the following situations have occurred in specific work: (1) Lack of unified leadership. The meetings arranged by the county for each district were not well organized. The Propaganda Department of the County Election Committee arranged for a meeting of Party members, Youth League members, and propagandists on July 18. Two or three days later, the County Production Committee Office convened a meeting of mutual aid team leaders. Following this, the County Civil Affairs Section arranged for a meeting of representatives of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers' families on August 1. Township and village cadres were busy dealing with these meetings and were unable to do practical work at all. (2) The cadres for the general election work did not seriously study the policies, so they could not explain the policies to the masses, causing many unnecessary concerns among the masses. Ma Dengju of Village 6, Dachao Township, was only twenty-five years old, but deliberately reported himself as thirty years old. Liu Fengjun of Village 5, the same township, wanted to get married earlier, so he reported his age as nineteen when he was sixteen. (3) The population registration work was very rough, and even contained errors. A cadre surnamed Feng in Village 2 of Chengguan Township only found Xing Baoyuan to report the population of the entire village when registering the population of the village. Now, after inspection, more than 40 percent of the village's population is wrong, either with incorrect names or incorrect ages. Village 1 of Chaoyang Township has a total of eighty-four households, with three hundred and twenty people; only twenty people were not registered incorrectly, while the remaining population, accounting for more than 93 percent of the village's total population, were all registered incorrectly.
    The above situation shows that the problems in the population survey and registration work in Zhaohua County are serious. The leading authorities of the county should carefully study the instructions from higher authorities and immediately make the necessary remedies for past mistakes to ensure the smooth development of the general election work.

    昭化县忽视普选中的人口调查登记工作
    读者双人来信：四川省昭化县普选中的人口调查登记工作没有搞好。该县中共县委副书记（县选举委员会主席）张佩隆说：“人口调查登记工作不一定强调，把普选工作做好了就等于做了人口调查登记工作。”县长杨昆山则说：“人口登记那能达到不重复，不遗漏，只要达到百分之八、九十的正确性就算好了。”由于领导干部对人口调查登记工作的意义和目的认识不清，对这项工作不重视，以致在具体工作中发生了这样一些情况：（一）领导不统一，县里给各区布置的会议没有很好地安排。县选举委员会宣传部布置七月十八日开党员、团员会议和宣传员会议。相隔两三天，县生产委员会办公室召开互助组长代表会议。接着县民政科布置八月一日开烈、军属代表会议。乡、村干部忙于应付这些会议，根本无法做实际工作。（二）普选工作干部没有认真学习政策，因而没法向群众交代政策，使群众产生许多不必要的顾虑。大朝乡六村马登举才二十五岁，便故意报成三十岁。该乡五马村刘凤君想早结婚，便把十六岁报成十九岁。（三）人口登记工作很粗糙，甚至有错误。城关乡二村一个姓冯的干部，在该村登记人口时，仅找邢宝元一人代报了全村人口。现在检查，全村有百分之四十以上的人口弄错了，不是姓名错，就是年龄错。朝阳乡一村共八十四户，三百二十人，仅二十人没有被登记错，其余占该村总人口百分之九十三以上的人口都被登记错了。
    以上情况，说明昭化县人口调查登记工作中的问题是严重的。该县领导方面应该好好学习上级指示，对过去错误立即作必要的补救，以保证普选工作的顺利开展。
