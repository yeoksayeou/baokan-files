    The Central First Ministry of Machine Building Issues Instructions
    to Implement Planned Management and Promote Operational Planning
    The Central First Ministry of Machine Building recently issued instructions on implementing planned management and promoting operational planning.
    The instructions first pointed out: Since the determination to strengthen planned management work in the first half of the year, enterprise management work has been further improved in all aspects. For example, several factories have begun to implement operational plans, and the passive situation in work has begun to reverse, leading to increased production. However, there are still many shortcomings in the work of the first half of the year. The completion of production tasks is not entirely satisfactory, and some factories have failed to complete their plans for several months.
    The disconnection phenomenon in the transition between new and old products is a widespread problem. The main reason is that production preparations for new products were not done well before they were hastily put into production, so that some factories could not produce products for several months, and most factories experienced the phenomenon of old products being produced intermittently and new products being produced intermittently. The plans for old products were repeatedly increased, and the time for formal production of new products was repeatedly postponed, constantly disrupting work plans and deployments, causing chaos and passivity in production.
    The balance of production is generally still very poor. The beginning of the month is slack, the end of the month is busy, and the phenomenon of rushing to catch up with tasks is still common. Many factories do not pay enough attention to mastering technology and quality, and product quality is still very unstable. Many technical problems in quality have not been effectively improved.
    In addition, there are still many problems in production management that need to be solved. The policy of strengthening planned management, which was decided this year, has basically been noted by all factories, and all factories have also made great efforts to improve management work. However, for several months, a most fundamental problem has not been solved, that is: Where should we start to strengthen planned management? Some factories focus on mobilizing the masses to discuss the national plan, thereby raising various indicators, but the specific steps for establishing planned management work are not clear; some factories focus on establishing a responsibility system or rectifying original records or rectifying institutions or implementing operating procedures in isolation; some factories even planned to implement workshop economic accounting systems too early. Although these practices have achieved some results in certain aspects, they have not solved the main problems in current production. Various factors that undermine the production plan continue to occur, and enterprise leaders have to passively deal with specific problems from all sides, thus forming a situation of being busy dealing with many temporary problems and rushing to catch up with tasks at the end of the month. According to various inspections and studies, and according to the experience of advanced enterprises, it has been proved that the implementation of operational planning is the basic method of implementing planned management and is the central link in organizing enterprise production activities.
    In order to compile an operational plan, first, a systematic functional organization for planning work must be established; the organizational structure must be sound and responsibilities and division of labor must be clear from the work section to the workshop to the factory; after the planning section issues production tasks, the production section should propose production targets for each workshop, and then the workshop should compile the operational plan based on the calculation of various data; second, there must be certain quota data, such as man-hour quotas, raw material consumption quotas, and mastering the number of work-in-progress in the workshop, which requires strengthening record-keeping and statistical work; third, it is necessary to calculate the capacity of the equipment, formulate equipment maintenance and repair plans, arrange the production processes of parts and components, and formulate operating procedures, which requires the workshop to improve the organization of technical work.
    In order to implement the operational plan: first, a systematic dispatching work and workshop service system must be established to promptly solve various problems that may cause production interruptions, so as to ensure the continuity, completeness, and planning of the production activities of parts and components. For this reason, it is necessary to establish a dispatching system to control product activities and a supply system for materials and work tools, and to establish a receiving, dispatching, and storage system for semi-finished products, etc. Second, a strict inspection system must be established to promptly grasp the quality situation and provide it to the responsible department for correction and resolution. Third, a practical technical organization measures plan must be formulated to solve new problems that occur in production at all times and to promote various advanced experiences in a timely manner. In addition, equipment maintenance and repair systems, technical responsibility and technical data, and drawing management systems should be established and improved according to the needs of implementing operational planning.
    The instructions emphasized that operational plans should have different requirements for enterprises with different production organization forms and management levels.
    According to the form of production organization, it can be divided into three categories: the first category, those with a single variety and specification, fixed tasks, and can be produced in a streamlined or large-scale manner, such as certain machine tool factories and bicycle factories; the second category, those with a single variety, complex specifications, and fixed tasks, which can be produced in large quantities or in batches, such as water pumps, fan ventilators, motors, and transformer factories; the third category, those with complex varieties and specifications, and many task changes, which can only be produced in batches or individually, such as the current heavy machinery factories and mining machinery factories.
    The operational plans of these three types of factories should be different in the degree of requirements: the first type of factory should gradually achieve comprehensive balanced production, and should formulate a standard plan table for parts and revise and amend it monthly to improve its advancement; a monthly operational plan should be established, even a ten-day (or weekly), daily operational plan; operating procedures should be formulated for all parts from the main to the secondary. The second type of factory should select the main products with relatively fixed specifications, from less to more, and organize comprehensive balanced production in the direction of the various requirements of the first type of factory; the requirements for secondary products can be relaxed, such as not making standard plans, formulating monthly operational plans according to statistical or estimated quotas, formulating operating procedures for main components, and arranging the processes of secondary components. The third type of factory cannot be required to organize comprehensive balanced production, but should organize balanced production of standard or general components (such as screws, pins, shafts, bearings, and gears, etc.) and formulate operating procedures and gradually improve the accuracy of quotas; for special products or components, only require estimating quotas according to experience to arrange processes, but must complete the production task according to the monthly plan.
    The above three types of factories have different levels of management, so the steps for implementing operational planning should also be different: one is a factory that has implemented operational planning and has achieved results. This type of factory should further improve the quality of the operational plan, overcome the current shortcomings, summarize the existing experience, and find a systematic management method for this type of factory to drive the relatively backward factories. One is a factory that basically has the conditions for implementing operational planning and should start implementing operational planning immediately; factories that still lack basic conditions should focus on solving the most important problems, create the necessary conditions, and then start implementing operational planning.
    The instructions said: In the process of implementing operational planning, two erroneous views should be opposed: one is emphasizing conditions, for example, saying that operational planning cannot be implemented if records and quotas are not accurate, and organizations and systems are not sound. The other view is not requiring conditions, thinking that any factory can immediately implement operational planning in any situation, thinking that various conditions will be improved with the implementation of operational planning. Both of these views are biased. Various tasks can only be gradually improved in the process of implementing operational planning, and it is impossible to prepare everything before implementing operational planning. However, the implementation of operational planning must have some basic conditions, such as records and quota data, organizational structure, and basic management systems, etc. Without the necessary conditions, the operational plan cannot be compiled, and no one will implement it. At present, enterprises should focus on preventing and overcoming the former view, and leading organs of enterprises should focus on preventing and overcoming the latter view.
    The instructions finally pointed out that in order to ensure the smooth implementation of the operational plan, the leading organs must fully help enterprises solve specific difficulties. For example, the planning of production tasks is not thorough, the deployment is slow, the tasks are insufficient, and the tasks change frequently, the supply of materials and technical assistance is insufficient and untimely, the lack of in-depth research on production work, and the failure to summarize and guide work and promote experience in a timely manner will hinder the advancement of enterprise management work. For this reason, the instructions made specific provisions for the future work of the various work departments and professional bureaus of the Ministry.

    中央第一机械工业部发布指示
    贯彻计划管理推行作业计划
    中央第一机械工业部最近发出关于贯彻计划管理推行作业计划的指示。
    指示首先指出：自上半年确定加强计划管理工作以来，企业管理工作在各方面有了进一步的提高，如若干厂已开始推行作业计划，工作的被动局面开始扭转，生产有了提高。但是，上半年的工作还存在很多缺点，生产任务的完成还不能令人完全满意，一部分工厂几个月来一直未完成计划。
    新旧产品交替中的脱节现象是普遍存在的问题。主要是新产品的生产准备没有做好即草率投入生产，以致有的厂几个月不能出产产品，多数厂出现旧产品停停做做和新产品做做停停的现象，旧产品一再追加计划，新产品一再推迟正式生产的时间，不断地打乱了工作计划和部署，造成生产的混乱和被动。
    生产的均衡性普遍都还很差。月初闲月底忙，前松后紧，突击赶任务的现象还普遍存在。许多厂对于掌握技术和质量重视不够，产品质量还很不稳定，质量上的许多技术问题还未能得到确实的改善。
    此外，生产管理中还有很多问题尚待解决。今年所决定的加强计划管理的方针，基本上已为各厂所注意了，各厂也曾以很大的努力来改进管理工作。但是几个月来，一个最根本的问题还没有得到解决，就是：加强计划管理应当从何处下手的问题。有的厂以发动群众讨论国家计划为中心，从而提高各项指标，但具体地建立计划管理工作的步骤则不明确；有的厂孤立地以建立责任制或整顿原始记录或整顿机构或贯彻操作规程等工作为中心；甚至有的厂曾过早地打算实行车间经济核算制。这些做法虽然在某些方面得到若干成绩，但没有解决当前生产中的主要问题。各种破坏生产计划的因素仍然不断发生，企业的领导不得不被动地应付来自各方面的具体问题，于是就形成了忙于招架解决许多临时性的问题与月终突击赶任务的情况。根据各方面检查和研究，根据先进企业的经验，都证明了推行作业计划是贯彻计划管理的基本方法，是组织企业生产活动的中心环节。
    为了编制作业计划，第一，要建立计划工作的系统的职能组织；从工段到车间到厂必须健全组织机构和明确职责与分工；计划科下达生产任务后，应由生产科提出各车间的生产指标，而后由车间根据各种资料的计算编制作业计划；第二，要有一定的定额资料，如工时定额、原材料消耗定额，及掌握车间在制品的数量，这就要求加强记录与统计工作；第三，要计算设备的能力，制订设备维护和检修计划，排列零件和部件的生产工序及制订操作规程，这就要求车间健全技术工作的组织。
    为了贯彻执行作业计划：第一，必须建立系统的调度工作和车间服务制度，及时解决可能造成生产中断的各种问题，以保证零件和部件生产活动的连续性、成套性和计划性。为此必须建立控制产品活动的调度制度及材料和工卡具的供应制度，建立半成品的收发与保管制度等等。第二，必须建立严密的检验制度，及时掌握质量情况并提供责任部门予以纠正和解决。第三，必须制订切实的技术组织措施计划，解决生产中时刻发生的新的问题和适时地推广各种先进经验。此外如设备的维护与检修制度、技术责任和技术资料与图纸的管理制度等均应根据贯彻作业计划的需要，予以建立与健全。
    指示强调指出：对于生产组织的形式和管理水平不同的企业，作业计划应有不同的要求。
    按生产组织形式可划分为三类：第一类，品种和规格单一、任务固定、可以流水或大量生产者，如某些工具机厂和自行车厂等；第二类，品种单一、规格复杂、任务固定，可大量或成批生产者，如水泵、扇风机、电机与变压器等厂；第三类，品种与规格都复杂、任务变换多，只能成批或单个生产者，如目前的重型机器厂与矿山机器厂。
    这三类工厂的作业计划在要求的程度上应有区别：第一类厂，应逐步做到全面的均衡生产，应制订零件的标准计划表，并逐月加以审订和修正以提高其先进性；应建立月的作业计划以至旬（或周）、日的作业计划；所有零件应从主要至次要制订操作规程。第二类厂，应选定规格较固定的主要产品，从少到多，以第一类厂的各项要求为方向组织全面的均衡生产；次要产品可以放宽要求，如不做标准计划，按统计或估计定额制订月的作业计划，制订主要部件的操作规程，排列次要部件的工序。第三类厂，不能要求组织全面的均衡生产，但应组织标准或通用部件（如螺丝、销子、轴及轴瓦和齿轮等）的均衡生产并制订操作规程及逐步提高定额的准确性；对于特殊产品或部件，只要求按照经验估算定额排出工序，但必须作到按月计划完成生产任务。
    上述三类工厂在管理水平上又各有高低，因此推行作业计划的步骤亦应有所区别：一种是已经推行了作业计划并有成绩的工厂，这种厂应进一步提高作业计划的质量，克服当前还存在的缺点，总结已有的经验，找出本类工厂的系统的管理办法以带动比较落后的工厂。一种是基本上具备了推行作业计划的条件的工厂应即入手推行作业计划；现在还缺乏基本条件的工厂，着重解决最主要的问题，创造必要的条件而后开始推行作业计划。
    指示说：推行作业计划中要反对两种错误看法：一是强调条件，例如说：记录与定额不准确，组织与制度不健全就不能推行作业计划。另一种看法是不要条件，认为任何一个工厂无论在什么情况下都可以立即推行作业计划，以为通过作业计划，各种条件会随着完善。这两种看法都有偏差。各种工作只有在推行作业计划中才能逐步提高，不可能在推行作业计划之前就把一切都准备完备。但推行作业计划又必须具备一些基本条件，如记录和定额资料，组织机构和基本的管理制度等，离开必要的条件，作业计划也就编不出来，也就无人执行。目前，在企业中应着重防止和克服前一种看法，在企业的领导机关内应着重防止和克服后一种看法。
    指示最后指出：保证作业计划的顺利推行，领导机关必须充分地帮助企业解决具体困难。例如：生产任务的计划不周，布置迟缓，任务不足及中途多变，材料供应、技术帮助等不足和不及时，缺乏对生产工作的深入研究，不能及时总结以指导工作和推广经验等等，这些都将阻碍企业管理工作的推进。为此，指示对部的各个工作部门和各专业局的今后工作，均作了具体规定。
