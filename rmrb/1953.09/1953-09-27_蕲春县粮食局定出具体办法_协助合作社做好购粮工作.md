The Qichun County Grain Bureau Formulates Specific Measures to Assist Cooperatives in Grain Procurement

At the county-wide grain work conference held last month, the Grain Bureau of Qichun County People's Government in Hubei Province focused on studying the issue of relying on cooperatives to purchase grain, and made specific arrangements on how to assist cooperatives in resolving difficulties in grain procurement.

The conference reviewed the past work of state-owned grain departments in the county in relying on cooperatives for grain procurement. In the past, due to insufficient understanding of the nature and role of cooperatives by cadres in the grain departments, unclear thinking on relying on cooperatives, and insufficient contact with cooperatives, the procurement work was affected. In order to do a good job in future rice procurement, the conference held a relatively long discussion on the issue of relying on cooperatives. Everyone clearly recognized that cooperatives are an important bridge for the state-owned economy to lead the individual economy, and a powerful assistant for the grain department to complete procurement tasks. Therefore, state-owned grain departments have the responsibility to support cooperatives and help cooperatives solve difficulties in procurement. The conference made the following regulations on how to help cooperatives do a good job in purchasing rice on behalf of the state: In terms of storage capacity and utensils, in order to solve the difficulty of insufficient storage capacity for cooperatives, places where warehouses can be borrowed should be lent to cooperatives; where there are no warehouses to borrow, the grain bureau should uniformly purchase hoarding strips, enclosure mats, and other reserve utensils and hand them over to the cooperatives for backup; other procurement utensils such as windmills and sieves should be lent to the cooperatives according to actual needs or purchased by the cooperatives on their behalf. In terms of grain storage, after the cooperatives receive the grain, the storage personnel of the local state-owned grain departments must regularly and proactively check the storage situation. The local grain departments should be responsible for any problems that arise; however, cooperatives should also assist the grain departments in paying attention to grain safety at all times. In terms of capital supply, convenience should be provided to cooperatives to ensure that procurement funds are not disconnected. In addition, in order to unify the standards for testing grain quality and implement the policy of pricing according to quality, the grain quality inspection personnel of the grain bureau should take the initiative to maintain close contact with the cooperatives, exchange experiences with each other, and ensure that the inspection standards of both parties are consistent.

    蕲春县粮食局定出具体办法
    协助合作社做好购粮工作
    湖北省蕲春县人民政府粮食局在上月召开的全县粮食工作会议上，着重研究了依靠合作社收购粮食的问题，对如何协助合作社解决购粮工作中的困难做了具体布置。
    会议对该县国营粮食部门过去依靠合作社收购粮食的工作作了检查。过去由于粮食部门的干部对合作社的性质和作用认识不足，依靠合作社的思想不明确，和合作社联系不够，以致影响了收购工作。为了做好今后稻谷收购工作，会议对依靠合作社问题做了较长时间的讨论。大家都明确认识了合作社是国营经济领导个体经济的重要桥梁，是粮食部门完成收购任务的有力助手，因此国营粮食部门有责任扶助合作社，帮助合作社解决收购中的困难。会议对如何帮助合作社做好代购稻谷工作做了如下规定：在仓容和用具方面，为了解决合作社仓容不足的困难，能借仓的地方应借仓给合作社；无仓可借的地方，由粮食局统一购置囤条、围席等储备用具交合作社备用；其他如风车、溜筛等收购用具，根据实际需要借给合作社或由合作社代购。在粮食保管方面，合作社收进粮食以后，各地国营粮食部门保管人员必须经常主动地去检查保管情况，出了问题，各所在地粮食部门应负责；但合作社也应协助粮食部门经常注意粮食安全。在资金供应方面，应给合作社以便利，保证收购资金不脱节。此外，为了统一检验粮食品质的标准，贯彻依质论价政策，粮食局检验粮食品质的人员应主动和合作社密切联系，互相交流经验，务使双方验级标准能够一致。
