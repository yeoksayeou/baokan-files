Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 20th: As in the previous three days, the U.S. side today handed over Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission without cards bearing names and prisoner numbers. This forced the Indian guard troops to merely count heads, unable to identify the individuals entering the camp.

Among the unchecked prisoners of war handed over to the Indian troops today, some carried large wooden sticks four to five feet long, others held iron bars three to four feet long. One very strong man carried two brand new large crutches on his shoulder, even though he clearly did not need crutches usually used by the injured.

Many prisoners of war lowered their heads as they passed the inspection point. Some would only steal a glance before someone in the ranks would shout sternly, "Move on, what are you looking at!" During the handover of the second group of prisoners, a thin, gaunt prisoner of war in his thirties stepped out of line. Just as he was about to approach the barbed wire, someone a few steps ahead rushed over and shouted at him, scaring him back into the ranks. When a group of prisoners passed in front of the Korean-Chinese observation representatives, a man holding a flag in front shouted to those behind him, "Everyone pay attention!" Then, he shouted a reactionary slogan, and those behind him followed suit. However, from the indistinct sound, it could be heard that it was a very forced shout.

After the prisoners of war entered the camp, someone blew a whistle to gather them for "indoctrination," shouting reactionary slogans. After the third group of prisoners entered the camp, several people directed them to gather together to sing reactionary songs, throwing stones at the Korean-Chinese observation representatives. When the singing became weak, a rough voice of reprimand was heard: "Sing louder!" Since only a few people were throwing stones, someone shouted again: "Throw them, why aren't you throwing them?"

    美方派遣特务混入战俘营场进行破坏工作
    【新华社开城二十日电】像以前三天一样，美方今天移交给中立国遣返委员会的中国人民志愿军被俘人员还是没有写着姓名和战俘编号的卡片，使印度看管部队只能点一下人数，而无法辨明这些拥入营场的人的身分。
    今天交给印度部队看管的没有经过点验的战俘中，有些人带着四、五尺长的大木棒，有的拿着三、四尺长的铁棍，有一个非常强壮的人在肩上扛着两支簇新的大拐杖，而他是完全不需要用这种伤病人员用的拐杖的。
    许多战俘走过点验地点时，都低着头，有的刚偷偷地侧过头来看一眼，行列中马上就有人厉声喊：“快走，看什么！”在第二批战俘交接时，有一个面容消瘦的三十多岁的战俘从行列中走出来，刚要靠近铁丝网时，在他前面几步的一个人就大踏步赶来向他喝了一声，吓得他连忙缩了回去。有一批战俘走过朝中观察代表面前时，前面一个手持旗子的人就向他后面的人高叫：“大家注意啦！”然后，他喊了一句反动口号，后面的人也跟着喊了一声，然而从声音的含糊不清可以听出那是很勉强的叫喊。
    战俘们进入营场后，就有人吹哨子把他们集合起来“训话”，喊反动口号。在第三批战俘进入营场后，有几个人指挥他们集中在一起唱反动歌，向朝中观察代表投石块。唱歌的声音微弱下来了，就听见一个粗暴的斥责声音：“大声唱！”投石块的也只有几个人，就有人又喝道：“扔哇，为什么不扔？”
