    Cherishing State Property is the People's Public Morality

    Cherishing public property is one of the public moralities that the Chinese people should possess. In a period when the state has entered planned economic construction, actively educating state personnel and the masses to cherish state property is of even greater significance. This is because to realize the industrialization of the country, a large amount of capital is required; and the accumulation of capital, on the one hand, must rely on the broad masses of workers and peasants to give full play to their initiative, do a good job in industrial and agricultural production, and create more wealth for the country; on the other hand, it must implement strict frugality and use existing funds and materials rationally, so that they do not suffer waste and loss. In recent years, many advanced individuals who cherish state property have emerged in factories, mines, enterprises, institutions, troops, schools, and among the people throughout the country. They not only actively fight against waste and destruction of state property in peacetime, but also bravely carry out rescue operations when state property suffers unexpected disasters, so that state property avoids or reduces losses. This is of great importance to the smooth development of our country's economic construction.

    Today, this newspaper publishes the actions of a unit of the North China Military Region in bravely extinguishing a fire and rescuing state materials, which is a prominent example of cherishing state materials. When more than a thousand people in the unit learned that the Handan Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company's warehouse was on fire, they immediately carried fire-fighting equipment and took the initiative to go to the fire to rescue it. Every cadre and soldier who participated in the fire fighting, inspired by a high degree of patriotism, actively carried out the rescue without regard for their own safety, so that 57 people were slightly injured and two were seriously injured. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's North China Bureau said in a notice: "It is precisely because the cadres and soldiers of the unit carried out such a highly conscious, well-organized, heroic, and tenacious struggle that the unit played a decisive role in this rescue work. Because the fire was quickly extinguished, not only a part of the materials was rescued from the fire, reducing the loss of state assets, but also the yarn factory near the fire was spared from the fire." This high degree of self-sacrifice of the cadres and soldiers of the unit is the most sublime manifestation of patriotism, and it is worthy of all state personnel, all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, and the masses of the people to learn from them.

    However, in our state organs, especially in those departments in charge of materials, there are some staff members who are not responsible for state property at all, are careless in their work, and sloppy, and thus some accidents have occurred, causing undue losses to state property. Today's newspaper's publication of the fire incident at the temporary warehouse of the Beijing Trust Company is one such example. Hou Boyan, the manager of the warehouse, seriously disregarded the safety of state property. He knew very well that the company had long stipulated that flammable goods and fireworks should not be moved into the warehouse, let alone soldering things containing flammable materials in the warehouse. However, after the company's cadres Gao Zongda and Zhang Shiji violated operating regulations and accepted the consignment of flammable waste film, he not only did not raise any objections, but also ignored worker Zhang Enlin's warning and soldered iron boxes containing waste film in the warehouse, thus causing a fire. Moreover, when the fire just started, if Hou Boyan had the slightest sense of responsibility to protect state property, he could have prevented the fire from spreading by simply pushing the box out of the door; but he only pushed it once and left. As a result, the fire spread and burned 100 million yuan worth of materials, and also burned three workers to death. This is an extremely shameful criminal act, which is absolutely not allowed by the laws of the state. Secondly, the relevant leaders of the company also bear certain responsibilities. Although the company has formulated a safety system, it has consistently failed to pay attention to fire protection, neither educating staff nor inspecting the implementation of the system. It is precisely because of this bureaucracy in the work that the incident of violating regulations by accepting flammable goods and soldering iron boxes was able to occur. In order to seriously enforce state discipline and educate cadres and the people, the Beijing Municipal People's Court and the People's Supervision Committee have given legal and administrative sanctions to the illegal and derelict personnel in this case, which is completely necessary.

    In order to effectively ensure the safety of state property and use it effectively for national construction, it is necessary to carry out patriotic education to all state personnel, commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, and the masses of the people, so that they understand the importance of cherishing state property. In particular, those organs in charge of materials should repeatedly and regularly explain to their staff that taking good care of state property is not only a public morality that a people should possess, but also a task entrusted to them by the state and the people, thereby enhancing their political awareness and sense of responsibility in their work. At the same time, it is also necessary to establish and improve various systems and regulations related to ensuring the safety of materials and fire protection, and to conduct inspections and supervision seriously, so as to ensure that they can be truly implemented and not become mere formalities. Those who have fulfilled their duties and made contributions to the custody of state property should be commended and rewarded; those who have caused losses to state property due to negligence of duty must be punished, and those whose circumstances are serious should also be sanctioned by the state law. In the past, some people mistakenly believed that destroying state property was not a big deal, and that it would be over as long as they made a review or gave criticism and education. This kind of thinking is extremely harmful, it will make our country's discipline slack, which is absolutely not allowed. In the future, judicial, procuratorial, and supervisory organs at all levels should actively fight against this wrong thinking. In the event of destruction of state property, if it is not due to irresistible disasters or lack of experience in work, but is caused by serious irresponsibility, and the circumstances are relatively serious, it must be regarded as an illegal act of dereliction of duty, and should be dealt with seriously, giving the relevant personnel legal or administrative sanctions separately. Only in this way can we continuously educate and improve the political awareness of state personnel, promote their patriotic spirit, and at the same time gradually establish a regular revolutionary legal system, in order to ensure the smooth progress of the national construction cause.

### 爱护国家财物是人民的公德

专栏：政法工作述评

    爱护国家财物是人民的公德
    爱护公共财物是我国人民应有的公德之一。在国家已进入计划经济建设的时期，积极地教育国家工作人员和人民群众珍惜国家的财物，更有着极其重大的意义。这是因为要实现国家的工业化，就必须有大量的资金；而资金的积累，一方面固然要依靠广大的工人和农民发挥高度的积极性，搞好工农业生产，为国家创造更多的财富；而另一方面则必须实行严格的节约，合理地使用现有的资金和物资，使其不致遭受浪费和损失。几年来，在各地的工厂、矿山、企业、机关、部队、学校和人民群众中，都出现了许多爱护国家财物的先进人物。他们不仅在平日积极地和浪费现象与破坏国家财物的现象作斗争，而且在国家物资遭受意外的灾害时，英勇地进行抢救，使国家财产避免了或减少了损失，这对于顺利地开展我国的经济建设事业，是有很大作用的。
    今天本报发表的华北军区某部英勇扑灭火灾，抢救国家物资的行动，就是这种爱护国家物资的显著的范例。该部千余人，在知道邯郸花纱布公司仓库失火时，就立即携带救火器材，主动地前往火场抢救。参加救火的每一个干部和战士，在高度的爱国主义精神的鼓舞下，都奋不顾身地积极进行抢救，因而有五十七人负轻伤，两人受了重伤。中共中央华北局的通报中说：“正由于该部干部和战士作了这样有高度觉悟、有严密组织的英勇顽强的斗争，所以该部对这次抢救工作起了决定性的作用。由于烈火迅速被扑灭，不仅在火场抢救出一部物资，减少国家资财损失，并使邻近火场的纱厂免遭火灾。”该部干部和战士的这种高度自我牺牲精神，是爱国主义的最崇高的表现，值得全体国家工作人员、全体解放军指战员和人民群众向他们学习。
    但是，在我们的国家机关中，特别是在那些掌管物资的部门中，却有一部分工作人员，对国家财产毫不负责，工作中粗枝大叶，马马虎虎，因而发生了一些事故，使国家财产受到不应有的损失。今天本报发表的北京市信托公司临时仓库失火事件，就是其中的一个例子。该仓库的管理人侯伯彦，严重地漠视国家财产的安全。他明明知道该公司早就规定，凡是易燃物品和烟火一概不得搬进仓库内，当然就更不许可在仓库内锡焊装有易燃物的东西。但在此次该公司干部高宗达和张士骥违反经营规章，擅自接受承运易燃品废电影片后，他不仅没有提出意见，反而不顾工人章恩林的警告，在仓库里锡焊装有废电影片的铁箱皮，因而酿成了火灾。而且在刚起火时，侯伯彦如果有丝毫爱护国家财产的责任心，只要把箱子推到门外，就可以使火灾不致扩大；但他只推了一把就走了。致使火灾得以漫延扩大，烧毁了一亿元的物资，还烧死了三个工人。这是一种极其可耻的犯罪行为，是国家的法律所绝对不能容许的。其次，该公司的有关领导人也负有一定的责任。该公司虽然制订了安全制度，但对消防工作一贯不重视，既不对工作人员进行教育，也不检查制度的执行情况。正是由于这种工作中的官僚主义，才使违反规章接受易燃品和锡焊铁箱皮的事件得以发生。为了严肃国家的法纪，教育干部和人民，北京市人民法院和人民监察委员会，分别给予此案的违法失职人员以法律处分和行政处分，是完全必要的。
    为了切实地保障国家财产的安全，使之有效地用于国家建设事业，必须向一切国家工作人员、解放军指战员和人民群众进行爱国主义的教育，使他们懂得爱护国家财产的重要性。特别是那些掌管物资的机关，更应反复地经常地向所属的工作人员说明，保管好国家财物，不仅是作为一个人民应有的公德，而且是国家和人民交付给他们的任务，从而提高他们的政治觉悟和工作责任心。同时还应建立和健全各种有关保证物资安全和消防的制度规章，并认真地进行检查监督，务使其能够真正贯彻执行，而不致流于形式。对于那些克尽职责、保管国家财产有功的人员，应给予表扬和奖励；对于那些因玩忽职守而使国家财产遭受损失的人员，则必须给予惩处，其中情节严重者，还应受到国家法律的制裁。过去有些人错误地认为，毁坏了国家的财产，并不是一件了不起的事，只要检讨一下或给予批评教育，就算完事了。这种思想是极其有害的，它会使我们国家的纪律松弛，这是绝对不能容许的。今后各级司法、检察和监察机关，应该积极地和这种错误的思想作斗争。凡是发生了毁坏国家财产的事件，如果不是由于不可抗拒的灾害，或工作上缺乏经验所致，而是由于严重不负责任所造成，并且情节又较为重大者，都必须视为一种违法失职行为，应该严肃地加以处理，分别给予有关人员以法律的处分或行政的处分。只有这样不断地教育提高国家工作人员的政治觉悟，发扬他们的爱国主义精神，而同时又逐步地建立起正规的革命法制，才能保障国家建设事业的顺利进行。
