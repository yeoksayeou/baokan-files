The unification of the great motherland and the unity of all nationalities, the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the realization of national equality between the Han, Tibetan, and other fraternal nationalities, and the protection of religious beliefs of all nationalities have made our country a large family of equality, fraternity, and cooperation among all nationalities.

It is planned to build many large-scale factories and mines in a few years with the help of the Soviet Union, laying the foundation for national industrialization and the modernization of national defense. This is a great task, and all nationalities in the country should work harder to consolidate the unity of the motherland and the unity of all nationalities, oppose the enemy's provocations and sabotage activities, and jointly build the great family of the motherland. Vice Premier Deng also pointed out: The progress and development in various aspects of Tibet and other Tibetan areas in the past few years have been great. This is inseparable from the efforts of the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Erdene, and other patriotic gentlemen and the Tibetan people, and it is inseparable from the assistance of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Han cadres entering Tibet to the Tibetan people. I hope that greater progress and development will be achieved in the future. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, we will continue to build Tibet and other Tibetan areas even better.
    The banquet proceeded in an atmosphere of close unity from beginning to end.
