Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The United States is attempting to further control Iran's economy through the Saidi government, which came to power not long ago through a coup it orchestrated.

Since Saidi came to power, the US Ambassador to Iran, Henderson, has been conducting intense activities in Tehran, constantly "consulting" with Saidi government officials. Subsequently, in a letter to Saidi on August 26, US President Eisenhower offered assurances of providing "assistance," stating that he would immediately dispatch a special representative to Iran for this matter. According to United Press, which revealed the US plot to further squeeze out Britain's position in Iran, Saidi has indicated to Henderson that he will agree to sell Iranian oil "under the administration of some new international organization."

These US plots to further enslave the Iranian people have aroused the anger of the broad masses of the Iranian people. Although the Saidi government has adopted high-handed measures, continuously arresting patriots on a large scale for half a month, the Iranian people continue to carry out a heroic struggle to win national independence. For example, according to an Associated Press reporter, in Isfahan, the center of the Iranian textile industry, slogans against the King of Iran and the Americans appear on the walls every morning. The US Consul in Isfahan has to be escorted by armed guards when walking on the street. The masses in Isfahan continue to shout: "Yankees go home!"

    伊朗人民坚持斗争
    反对美国奴役伊朗人民的阴谋
    据新华社讯：美国正企图通过不久以前在它操纵下发动政变而上台的萨希迪政府，进一步控制伊朗的经济。
    自从萨希迪上台后，美国驻伊朗大使汉德逊就在德黑兰展开了紧张的活动，不断和萨希迪政府官员“商谈”。接着，美国总统艾森豪威尔又在八月二十六日给萨希迪的信中提出了给予“援助”的保证，并说将为此事立刻派遣特别代表到伊朗去。据合众社透露美国进一步排挤英国在伊朗的地位的阴谋说，萨希迪已向汉德逊表示，他将同意“在某种新的国际组织的管理之下”出售伊朗石油。
    美国的这些企图进一步奴役伊朗人民的阴谋，激起了伊朗广大人民的愤怒。虽然萨希迪政府采取高压手段，半月来不断大规模逮捕爱国分子，但是伊朗人民仍然继续进行争取民族独立的英勇斗争。例如据美联社记者报道，在伊朗纺织业中心伊斯法罕，每天早晨，墙上都出现有反对伊朗国王和美国人的标语。美国驻伊斯法罕领事在街上走动时不得不带着武装警卫队护送。伊斯法罕的群众继续高喊：“美国佬滚回去！”
