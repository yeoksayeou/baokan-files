In the labor competition of the Third Coal Mine of the Pinggui Mining Bureau of Guangxi Province, undesirable consequences were caused by simply increasing labor intensity.

Since the Third Mine of the Pinggui Mining Bureau of Guangxi Province launched a labor competition in mid-March this year, labor productivity has gradually increased, the main consumption quotas have also been reduced, and the production tasks for the first half of the year have been overfulfilled.

However, there are still serious shortcomings in the movement: First, the leading cadres have neglected to make learning and promoting advanced experience the central content of the competition. They have not mobilized the masses to find shortcuts, tap potential, put forward rationalization proposals, and learn and promote advanced experience around the key issues in production. This has led to the phenomenon of simply increasing labor intensity. For example, the mining workshop originally stipulated that each person should not carry more than sixty catties of raw ore at a time (because they had to climb a slope of more than thirty degrees for dozens of meters), but in the competition, some workers carried as much as one hundred and twenty catties. As a result, many workers took sick leave to rest the month after competing. Some workers were already very tired, but they were afraid of affecting the whole team, so they had to persevere. In particular, some porters were exhausted as a result. However, the leadership not only did not stop this phenomenon, but instead encouraged it. The leadership was not active in supporting the workers' rationalization proposals. For example, Zhao Chuchun, a smelting worker, and others spontaneously improved the flue of the blast furnace to increase the recovery rate; Wang Leiming, a mechanical and electrical worker, changed the rotating chain head of the vertical shaft winch to a gear; and Wu Sen and Wu Wenguang successfully trial-produced oil nozzles. These deeds played a great role in production, but the leadership did not promptly commend and reward them, nor did they summarize and promote these advanced experiences.

Secondly, because the leading cadres did not start with ideological education, but simply used material rewards to encourage workers, this created the workers' economism and championship mentality, making the movement unsustainable and unconsolidated. In order to promote the development of the movement, the mine's leadership formulated five reward systems at once: over-quota award, safety award, conservation award, attendance rate award, and red flag award. In order to get the over-quota award and the red flag award, the workers lowered the quotas when discussing the plan. For example, in the mining workshop's plan for July, the planned quotas of eight of the seventeen digging faces lagged behind the actual mining capacity in June. For example, the planned mining capacity of the No. 2 digging face was 1.1 tons per worker, but the actual amount had already reached 1.567 tons in June. In addition, the over-quota reward in Shuizhuang was calculated based on the amount of sand produced, rather than the amount of earthwork or raw ore, which was extremely unreasonable. This led to workers being conservative when making plans. For example, they could produce one ton of sand per month, but in order to get the reward, they only planned to produce 600 kilograms. This caused the quota indicators to lose their role in improving and guiding production, and instead fostered the conservative and backward thinking of the employees, failing to fully unleash the potential of the enterprise. At the same time, in order to get the reward, the workers did not hesitate to violate the regular operation procedures and refused to listen to the guidance of engineers and technicians, resulting in serious waste of labor and materials. Also, due to the large number of reward items and the unreasonable reward system itself, the rewards did not play a role in increasing production at all. For example, the average wage in the smelting workshop reached as high as 275 points, an increase of 53% over the original wage. Some workers only thought about bonuses and ignored production. For example, a mechanical and electrical worker proposed to guarantee that he could repair the winch, but he wanted the leadership to give him three million yuan in bonuses first. Some workers in the mining workshop complained that the bonus was too little, saying, "Eight thousand yuan to compete is not enough to buy medicine." Some workers said, "It's worth competing if it pays off, and we won't do it if it doesn't pay off." When two teams competed, one team estimated that they would not win and would not get the reward, so they quit halfway and wanted to wait until they were fully confident next month to win the red flag and get the bonus.

Because of these serious shortcomings in the competition, the thinking of the employees was very confused, and the potential of the enterprise was not fully utilized. For example, the average utilization rate of equipment was still less than 50%, and some only reached 5%. Therefore, it was difficult to maintain the competition. As soon as the competition stopped, it would immediately return to its original state. For example, the vertical shaft workshop used to produce more than 110 buckets of raw ore per shift during the competition, but now it only produces more than 30 buckets per shift, which is a clear example.

Therefore, the mine should start with summarizing this experience, learn from this lesson, clearly recognize the importance of strengthening planning management, grasp the central link of planning management - the formulation and implementation of operation plans, and organize balanced production. Then, around this central link, and focusing on the key issues in production, it should mobilize the masses to find shortcuts, tap potential, promote advanced experience, and earnestly reverse this chaotic situation.

    广西平桂矿务局第三煤矿劳动竞赛中
    单纯提高劳动强度造成不良后果
    广西省平桂矿务局第三矿从今年三月中旬开展劳动竞赛以来，劳动生产率逐步提高了，主要消耗定额也有所降低，并且超额完成了上半年的生产任务。
    但运动中仍存在着严重的缺点：首先是领导干部忽视了以学习和推广先进经验为竞赛的中心内容，没有围绕生产上的关键问题去发动群众找窍门、挖潜力、提合理化建议和学习推广先进经验，以致形成单纯地提高劳动强度的现象。如采矿车间本来规定每人每次挑原矿石不能超过六十市斤（因为要爬几十公尺长的三十度以上的斜坡），但竞赛中有些工人竟挑到一百二十市斤，因此很多工人上个月竞赛，下个月就请病假休息。有些工人本来很累了，但是怕因为自己影响全班，只好硬顶下去。特别?有的搬运工人就是因此而累坏的。可是，领导上对这种现象不但不加制止，反而予以鼓励。而对工人的合理化建议却不积极支持。如冶炼工赵初春等人自发地改进鼓风炉烟巷，提高收回率，机电工汪磊明把直井绞车的转动链头改为齿轮，吴森、吴文光试制油咀成功等事迹，对生产起了很大作用，但领导方面既没有及时表扬和奖励，亦未总结推广这些先进经验。
    其次是由于领导干部不是从进行思想教育入手，而是单纯地用物质奖励的办法来鼓励工人，造成工人的经济主义观点和锦标主义思想，使运动不能持久和巩固。该矿领导方面为了推动运动的发展，一下子便制订出超额奖、安全奖、节约奖、出勤率奖、红旗奖等五种奖励制度，工人为了得超额奖与红旗奖，在讨论计划时便压低定额。如采矿车间七月份的计划，十七个壋头就有八个壋头的计划定额落后于六月份实际采挖能力。如特别?二号壋头计划采挖能力每工一点一吨，实际上六月份早已达到一点五六七吨。另外，水庄的超额奖励是以产砂多少为计算单位，而不是以土方或原矿量为计算单位，这个办法极不合理。因此造成工人订计划时保守，如每月本可产砂一吨，而工人为了得奖只订六百公斤。使定额指标失去了提高与指导生产的作用，反而助长了职工的保守落后思想，不能充分发挥企业的潜在力量。同时，工人为了得奖，不惜破坏正规作业，不听工程师、技术人员的指导，造成人工、材料的严重浪费。又由于奖励项目繁多，奖励制度本身不合理，奖励根本起不了提高生产的作用。如冶炼车间的平均工资即因此高达二百七十五分，比原工资提高了百分之五十三。有些工人竟只想到奖金，不顾生产。如某机电工提出保证可把卷扬机修好，但要领导上先给他三百万元的奖金；采矿车间有些工人嫌奖金钱少，说：“八万块钱来竞赛，吃药都不够。”有些工人说：“划得来就竞赛，划不来就不干。”又有两个班竞赛时，其中一个班估计自己赛不过了，得不到奖，就中途不干了，要等下月有了充分把握时再来夺红旗、得奖金。
    由于竞赛中存在着这些严重的缺点，造成职工思想很混乱，企业潜在能力也没有充分发挥。如设备利用率平均还不到百分之五十，有些只达到百分之五。因此，竞赛就很难坚持下去，只要竞赛停止，马上就会恢复原状。如直井车间，在竞赛时每班曾出原矿石一百一十多桶，现在每班只出三十多桶，就是一个明显的例子。
    因此，该矿应当从总结这一经验入手，记取这一教训，明确认识加强计划管理的重要性，抓住计划管理的中心环节——编制与贯彻作业计划，组织均衡生产。然后围绕这一中心环节，针对生产上的关键问题，发动群众找窍门、挖潜力、推广先进经验，认真地扭转这一混乱局面。
