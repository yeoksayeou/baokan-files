Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 9th: Following the Korean armistice, the Japanese people's "Peace Month" movement has further developed. Many places throughout the country have held peace conferences and other forms of activities to strive for peace. Through these activities, the Japanese people expressed their will to demand peace, strive for negotiation, and oppose American military bases.

The "Boso Peace Conference," prepared by people from all walks of life on the Boso Peninsula (Chiba Prefecture) on the east coast of Tokyo Bay for more than two months, was officially held in Chiba City on August 15. About 1,000 peace-loving people from all over Chiba Prefecture attended the conference. The conference heard reports on "Celebrating the Korean Armistice" and "Abolishing Military Bases," and unanimously passed five resolutions to further promote the peace movement. The resolutions called for the five major powers to resolve international disputes through consultation; to launch a signature campaign to abolish American military bases; to establish a Chiba Prefecture Peace Protection Committee; and to convene workers' conferences on the revival of peaceful industries, farmers' conferences on the revival of agriculture, and fishermen's conferences on the revival of fisheries. Goro Hani, a member of the House of Councillors who attended the Vienna World People's Peace Congress, gave a report to the conference.

In Kansai, the industrial and commercial hub of Japan, a grand "All Kansai Peace Festival" was held in Osaka on August 20. Under the slogan of "Striving for World Peace through Negotiation," 30,000 representatives from Osaka, Kyoto, Hyogo, Nara, Wakayama and other prefectures, as well as representatives from various political parties and organizations, participated in the Peace Festival. At the Peace Festival conference, representatives of many political parties and organizations delivered congratulatory speeches. Representatives of the Wakayama Prefecture People's Relief Water Disaster Organization issued a declaration expressing their determination to defend peace. A youth representative from Uchinada Village, who insisted on opposing the establishment of a US military firing range, also spoke at the conference. Goro Hani also attended this Peace Festival conference and gave a report. He pointed out the importance of the Japanese peace movement, saying: "People all over the world are paying attention to the Japanese peace movement." The conference ended with 30,000 people singing "Defend Peace" together.

In Hokkaido, the All Hokkaido Peace Conference was held in Sapporo on August 15. The conference received congratulatory telegrams from the famous peace advocate Wan'emon Nakamura and Sadako Ogasawara, a representative from Hokkaido who attended the World Women's Congress, and passed a peace declaration and a letter to the people of all Hokkaido. On the same day, the Otaru area of Hokkaido, under the auspices of the local "Peace Month" Executive Committee, held the Otaru Peace Conference, which passed resolutions opposing the militarization of Otaru as a naval port and convening a peace conference of the five major powers. Amidst the tense struggle against capitalist layoffs, the Yubari Coal Miners' Union in Hokkaido also continuously held many activities during "Peace Month," such as peace speech rallies, peace costume balls, screenings of progressive films, and peace labor culture meetings, creating a very high atmosphere of defending peace.

Following the Japanese people's anti-military base conference held on June 25, when "Peace Month" was inaugurated, rallies were held in various places to oppose American military bases. On August 16, the "All Kanto Mountain Peace Conference" was held at the foot of Mount Myogi, which the United States and the Yoshida government attempted to seize as a military exercise ground. About 3,000 workers, students, and citizens from Tokyo and many other places attended this conference. At a time when the Yoshida government was stepping up its efforts to forcibly occupy Mount Myogi as a military exercise ground through threats and inducements, this conference expressed its firm will to defend peace and oppose American military bases. Then, on August 22, Tokyo held another Tokyo anti-military base conference. 370 Japanese workers from the Tachikawa US military base, who were then engaged in a struggle with a general strike, as well as housewives and students, participated in this conference. The conference discussed in detail methods to promote the anti-military base struggle, and decided to establish a "Tokyo Military Base Issues Liaison Council" to prepare for the convening of an All Kanto region anti-military base conference.

    日本人民的“和平月”运动进一步开展起来
    【新华社九日讯】东京消息：朝鲜停战后，日本人民的“和平月”运动进一步开展，全国的许多地方都举行了和平大会和其他形式的争取和平活动。通过这些活动，日本人民表示了他们要求和平、争取协商运动、反对美国军事基地的意志。
    东京湾东岸房总半岛（千叶县）各界人民筹备了两个多月的“房总和平大会”，于八月十五日在千叶市正式举行。出席大会的有千叶县各地爱好和平的人士约一千人。大会听取了“庆贺朝鲜停战”和“撤销军事基地”的报告，并一致通过了进一步推进和平运动的五项决议。决议要求五大国以协商办法解决国际争端；发动征集撤销美国军事基地的签名运动；成立千叶县保卫和平委员会；分别召开复兴和平工业工人会议、复兴农业农民会议和复兴渔业渔民大会等。曾出席维也纳世界人民和平大会的参议员羽仁五郎向大会作了报告。
    在日本的工商业汇集地区关西，八月二十日在大阪举行了盛大的“全关西和平节”。在“以协商方法争取世界和平”的口号下，参加和平节的有大阪、京都、兵库、奈良、和歌山等府和县的代表以及各政党、团体的代表三万人。在和平节的大会上，许多政党和团体的代表都致词祝贺。和歌山县人民救济水灾组织的代表向大会发表了宣言，表示保卫和平的决心。坚持反对美军设立打靶场斗争的内滩村青年代表也在大会上讲了话。羽仁五郎也出席了这个和平节大会，并作了报告。他指出日本和平运动的重要性说：“全世界的人们都很注意日本的和平运动。”大会在三万人合唱“保卫和平”歌声中结束。
    在北海道，八月十五日在札幌举行了全北海道和平大会。大会收到了著名和平人士中村玩右卫门和北海道出席世界妇女大会的代表小笠原贞子等人的贺电，并通过了和平宣言和告全北海道人民书。在这同一天，北海道小樽地方在当地“和平月”执行委员会的主持下举行了小樽和平大会，大会通过了反对使小樽军港化、召开五大国和平会议等项决议。北海道夕张煤矿工会在反对资本家解雇的紧张斗争中也连续举行了“和平月”的许多活动，如和平演讲大会、和平大化装舞会、放映进步电影、和平劳动文化会等等，保卫和平的气氛十分高涨。
    继六月二十五日“和平月”揭幕时举行的日本人民反对军事基地大会之后，各地纷纷集会反对美国军事基地。八月十六日，在美国和吉田政府企图霸占为军事演习场的妙义山山麓举行了“全关东山地和平大会”。出席这个大会的有东京等许多地方的工人、学生、市民等约三千人。在吉田政府正加紧以威胁利诱的办法强占妙义山为军事演习场的时候，这个大会表示了保卫和平、反对美国军事基地的坚决意志。接着，八月二十二日东京又举行了一次东京反对军事基地大会。当时正在以总罢工进行斗争的立川美国军事基地的日本工人，以及家庭妇女、学生等三百七十人参加了这个大会。大会详细讨论了推进反军事基地斗争的方法，并决定成立“东京军事基地问题联络会”，准备召开全关东地方的反对军事基地大会。
