Some Experiences in Organizing Teachers to Study Marxism-Leninism
Wang Haisu, President of Nanjing Institute of Technology

    The teachers of Nanjing Institute of Technology began to study Marxist-Leninist theory in the first half of this year. The content of the study includes "Dialectical Materialism," "On Contradiction," and "On Practice." Thanks to the teachers' serious attitude towards the study and the leadership's appropriate grasp of the purpose and requirements of the study, the study has achieved certain results. For each unit of study, the main points of the theory can generally be clarified, and it can be used to initially connect with reality and solve some ideological, work, and professional problems. After this stage of study, the vast majority of teachers (approximately 95%) have become interested in the study of Marxist-Leninist theory, realized the importance of studying Marxist-Leninist theory, and established confidence in studying Marxist-Leninist theory on the basis of self-study, laying the foundation for further systematic study of Marxism-Leninism in the future.
    Now I will write down the experiences of leading this study:
    (1) The teachers of Nanjing Institute of Technology generally have the view of emphasizing professional work and neglecting politics. Generally, they have not really come into contact with Marxist-Leninist theory, except for a very small number of teachers who have put in some effort in the past. They do not understand what the connection is between Marxist-Leninist theory and themselves; in addition, some young teachers, although they attach importance to politics, have in the past only focused on participating in political activities and general current affairs political study, and also lack systematic theoretical knowledge. Since liberation, teachers have made great progress politically through many political movements, especially the ideological remolding study movement, and through a period of practice of learning from the Soviet Union and carrying out teaching reforms. The school's publicity during this period on the importance of studying Marxist-Leninist theory, and on the fact that systematic study of Marxist-Leninist theory is one of the fundamental conditions for improving ideological level and teaching quality, has also had a great impact on teachers; therefore, the desire to further improve themselves ideologically and the desire to systematically study Marxist-Leninist theory exist among teachers. This is the basis for us to carry out systematic theoretical study among teachers. However, before teachers have actually come into contact with Marxist-Leninist theory, their understanding of the importance of theoretical study is still vague, and their desire and requirements for study are not firm. Therefore, in the early stage of study, we must pay attention to consolidating and improving everyone's enthusiasm for study. In this regard, one of the methods we have adopted is to make everyone truly realize that Marxism-Leninism is a universal truth as much as possible. In the initial stage of study, some people often like to grasp some of the viewpoints of Marxism-Leninism, and try to apply them everywhere and make forced connections, attempting to test whether Marxism-Leninism is truly "applicable to all countries," or raising some strange questions and requiring them to be explained from the perspective of Marxism-Leninism. For this situation, we must not adopt a dismissive, mocking, or indifferent attitude, but should carefully study these problems and study the reasons for these problems; no matter how strange the problem is, we should give a relatively satisfactory answer as much as possible, and summarize these problems, analyze them, and guide everyone to the correct path of study. This is possible and necessary; because the questions raised in the study of Marxist-Leninist philosophy generally belong to the following aspects: one is the problems caused by deviations in the understanding of the theory itself; one is the problems caused by the fact that the questions raised do not belong to the category of philosophy, but are caused by the lack of correct and profound knowledge of the object being studied (nature, society, thinking); one is the problems caused by the existence of one-sidedness in the way of thinking, the severance of the connection between the problem being studied and the surrounding environment, or the research being carried out without considering the time, place, and conditions. For problems of the first type, it is necessary to further clarify the theory and clarify the concepts; for problems of the second type, it is necessary to point out that Marxist philosophy cannot replace all specialized sciences and concrete practices, and it cannot be believed that it is not necessary to have correct and profound knowledge and experience of specialized sciences or practices, and that relying solely on Marxist philosophy can directly solve various specialized problems (of course, all specialized sciences and practices must follow the direction indicated by Marxist philosophy in order to obtain correct results). Marxist philosophy can only play its guiding role when it is combined with in-depth research on reality, and when it is connected with developing science and the practice of transforming reality; for problems of the third type, it is necessary to point out that it is not permissible to use certain viewpoints and laws of Marxist philosophy as formulas to rigidly apply them to any phenomenon in isolation. This practice is contrary to Marxism-Leninism. It is necessary to summarize the many questions raised and give appropriate explanations by citing representative examples. If you say: "This question is meaningless," "That question has nothing to do with Marxism-Leninism," or "These and those are exceptions," answering questions in this way is not only wrong, but also easily discourages the enthusiasm of beginners. Since Marxism-Leninism also has problems that cannot be explained in this way or that way, or there are too many "exceptions," it will make people not believe that it is a universal truth, it will reduce people's trust in it, and it will be difficult to encourage everyone to learn with a resolute attitude.
    (2) When studying each part and each theoretical point, we must make everyone clearly recognize its purpose. "Materialist dialectics," "Dialectical materialism," and "On Contradiction" and "On Practice," whether in the overall aspect or in each part and each basic viewpoint, principle, and law, its theoretical purpose is very clear. In addition to clarifying its purpose, we must also combine specific objects, and proceed from everyone's ideological reality, work reality, and professional reality to point out what education it gives us. The issues that are currently most easily combined and have practical guiding significance among teachers are issues related to ideological remolding, teaching reform, and scientific research. We should draw more materials from these aspects and make some explanations. Doing so can prevent theory from being divorced from reality on the one hand, and make everyone feel that they have "concrete gains" and "solve problems" on the other hand, so that the interest in learning can continue to grow.
    (3) After the above problems are largely resolved, and everyone feels that learning is important and becomes interested, we should explain the theory and link it more with examples of political life and class struggle to help everyone increase their knowledge in the political field and broaden their horizons, instead of limiting the scope of linking with reality to natural sciences and teaching life. In terms of depth, we should also guide everyone to recognize the class nature and partisanship of Marxist philosophy, and while studying the materialist viewpoint and dialectical method, study how to observe problems from the standpoint of the proletariat. In fact, many problems in Marxist philosophy cannot be understood if they are not studied from the standpoint of the proletariat.
    (4) In the entire learning process and in each unit learning process, we must first insist on clarifying the basic viewpoints of the theory, and require that we have a clear concept of each theoretical point; therefore, we must focus on studying the documents, and the purpose of linking with reality is to clarify the concepts. Then, we require the ability to use these basic viewpoints to exercise the ability to solve practical problems; at this time, the purpose of linking with reality is to guide everyone to grasp the theoretical weapon to solve practical problems such as ideology, work, and business, and to further understand the spirit and essence of the theory. In this way, we prevent the empiricist tendency of rushing to solve practical problems before the theory has been clarified, and we also prevent the dogmatic tendency of stopping the study at nouns and concepts. The result of doing so is good.
    (5) This time, our requirements for learning are not high. The general requirements are: 1. To have a systematic and general understanding of the theoretical points of "Dialectical Materialism" and "On Contradiction" and "On Practice," so as to lay a preliminary foundation for further study of Marxist-Leninist theory and scientific research work in the future; 2. To initially cultivate the interest and ability to study Marxist-Leninist theory by oneself. Under this requirement, all the problems that can be temporarily set aside are temporarily set aside; if you study too deeply and too broadly in the early stage of study, this can only satisfy the desires of a few people, and most people will be daunted. The learning time for each unit should not be too long either. We strive to learn the whole picture of the problem in a relatively short period of time, so that everyone feels that the gains are significant and enhances everyone's confidence and interest in learning; if it takes a long time and only a little bit is gained, it will inevitably breed a sense of boredom and fatigue, which should be prevented.
    (6) In terms of learning methods, we adhere to the principle of "self-study as the main method, supplemented by explanation and discussion." On the basis of independent study and independent thinking, we supplement it with necessary enlightening reports, question and answer reports, and prepared discussions. The purpose of explanation and discussion is to guide and promote self-study. This method has proven to be effective. The teachers' serious reading of documents and writing of study notes far exceeded our estimates. The original study time was an average of four and a half hours per week, but in reality, most of them exceeded this number. The reason for this is not only that the teachers understand that in order to master theory, they must read and study seriously, but also that university teachers have the habit of self-study and the ability to think independently, and at the same time they have a relatively high level of culture and science, which we must have sufficient estimates of. It is obviously inappropriate to replace self-study with giving reports or holding discussion meetings among university teachers.
    The form of discussion meetings should be flexible and diverse, but no matter what form it takes, it must have a center and be prepared, so that it can be carried out on the basis of full self-study and can achieve the purpose of promoting self-study. We must prevent discussion methods that are poorly prepared, have no center, and waste time.

    组织教师学习马克思列宁主义的点滴经验
    南京工学院院长  汪海粟
    南京工学院的教师，从今年上半年开始了马克思列宁主义理论的学习，学习内容包括“辩证唯物主义”、“矛盾论”、“实践论”三个部分。由于教师们以认真的态度参加了学习，由于领导方面适当地掌握了学习的目的和要求，这次学习取得了一定成绩。每一单元的学习，一般能够弄清理论的要点，并且用以初步联系实际，解决思想上、工作上和业务上的一些问题。经过这一阶段的学习，绝大部分教师（约占百分之九十五）对马克思列宁主义理论的学习已经发生了兴趣，并体会到马克思列宁主义理论学习的重要，树立了在自学为主的基础上研究马克思列宁主义理论的信心，为今后进一步系统地学习马克思列宁主义奠定了基础。
    现在把领导这次学习的经验写在下面：
    （一）南京工学院的教师，一般存在着重业务轻政治的观点。对于马克思列宁主义理论，过去除了极少一部分教师曾经下过一些功夫以外，一般都没有真正接触过，马克思列宁主义理论和自己究竟有着什么关联是不理解的；另外有一部分青年教师虽然对政治是重视的，但以往也只偏重于参加政治活动和一般的时事政治学习，同样缺乏系统的理论知识。解放以来，教师们经过许多次政治运动，尤其是经过思想改造学习运动，再经过学习苏联、进行教学改革的一段实践过程，政治上一般都有了很大的进步。学校方面在此期间进行的关于学习马克思列宁主义理论的重要性的宣传，关于系统地学习马克思列宁主义理论是提高思想水平和教学质量的根本条件之一的宣传，对于教师们也有着很大的影响；因而要求从思想上进一步提高自己，要求系统地学习马克思列宁主义理论的愿望，在教师中间是存在的。这正是我们在教师中开展系统的理论学习的基础。但是教师们在没有实际接触马克思列宁主义理论之前，对于理论学习的重要性的认识毕竟是模糊的，学习的愿望和要求是不牢固的。因此，在学习初期，必须注意巩固和提高大家的学习热情。在这方面，我们所采取的办法之一，是尽可能地让大家真正认识马克思列宁主义是普遍真理。在初学阶段，往往有些人欢喜抓住马克思列宁主义的一些论点，到处硬套、硬联系，企图试验马克思列宁主义究竟是否“放之四海而皆准”，或者提出一些奇奇怪怪的问题，要求以马克思列宁主义的观点加以解释。对于这种情形，不能采取轻视、讥笑或置之不理的态度，而要认真地研究这些问题，并且研究产生这些问题的原因；不管怎样奇怪的问题，都应该尽可能地给予比较满意的答复，并且把这些问题归结起来，分析一下，把大家引导到正确的学习道路上去。这样做是可能的，而且是必要的；因为在学习马克思列宁主义哲学中所提出来的问题，一般是属于以下几方面的：一种是由于对理论本身在理解上有偏差而产生的问题；一种是由于所提出的问题不是属于哲学范畴的问题，而是因为对被研究的对象（自然、社会、思维）缺乏正确的和深刻的知识而产生的问题；一种是由于思想方法上存在片面性，对于被研究的问题，割断了它和周围的联系，或者脱离了时间、地点、条件去进行研究因而产生的问题。属于第一种的问题，需要进一步弄清楚理论，弄清楚概念；属于第二种性质的问题，需要指出马克思主义哲学不可能代替一切专门科学和具体的实践，不能认为，不需要对专门的科学或实践具有正确的、深刻的知识和经验，单凭马克思主义哲学，就可以直接解决各种专门问题（当然一切专门科学和实践，又必须沿着马克思主义哲学所指引的方向，才能得出正确的结果）。马克思主义哲学只有当它和对现实的深刻研究相结合的时候，只有当它同发展中的科学和变革现实的实践取得联系的时候，才能发挥它的指导作用；属于第三种性质的问题，需要指出，以马克思主义哲学的某些观点、法则当作公式去孤立地硬套任何现象，都是不允许的。这种做法，是违反马克思列宁主义的。对于所提出的许多问题，综合起来，并且举出具有代表性的事例，给以恰当的解释，是必要的。如果说：“这个问题没有意思”，“那个问题和马克思列宁主义无关”，或者“这些那些都是例外的事”，这样回答问题，不但是错误的，而且容易打击初学者的情绪。马克思列宁主义既然也有这样那样不能解释的问题，或者
  “例外”的东西太多了，就会使人们不相信它是普遍真理，就会降低人们对它的信任，就难以鼓舞大家以坚决的态度学下去。
    （二）在学习每一部分以及每一个理论要点的时候，都要让大家明确认识它的目的性。“唯物辩证法”、“辩证唯物论”和“矛盾论”、“实践论”，无论是总的方面或每一个部分以及每一个基本观点、原则、法则，它的理论的目的性都是很明确的。除了阐明它的目的性之外，还要结合具体的对象，从大家的思想实际、工作实际、业务实际出发，指出它给我们以什么教育。当前在教师们中间最容易结合而又有现实指导意义的问题，是属于思想改造、教学改革、科学研究等方面的问题，我们就应该多从这几个方面吸取材料，作些说明。这样作，一方面可以防止理论脱离现实，另一方面使大家感到“有具体收获”，“解决问题”，因而学习兴趣能够不断地增长。
    （三）等到上述问题大体解决，大家感到学习重要，并发生兴趣之后，就应当在阐明理论时，多联系一些有关政治生活、阶级斗争的事例，帮助大家增长政治领域的知识，扩大视野，而不把联系实际的范围局限在自然科学、教学生活等方面。在深度方面，也要引导大家认识马克思主义哲学的阶级性和党派性，在和学习唯物观点、辩证方法的同时，学习用无产阶级的立场观察问题。事实上，马克思主义哲学上的许多问题，如果不从无产阶级立场出发作研究，是不能理解的。
    （四）在整个学习过程和每一个单元学习过程中，首先要坚持弄清楚理论的基本观点，要求对各个理论要点具有明确的概念；因此必须着重钻研文件，而联系实际的目的是为了把概念弄清楚。然后要求运用这些基本观点去锻炼解决实际问题的能力；这时候联系实际的目的，是为了引导大家掌握理论武器去解决思想、工作、业务等实际问题，并进一步体会理论的精神和实质。这样，既防止了尚未弄清楚理论就忙于解决实际问题的经验主义的偏向，又防止了把学习停留在名词、概念上的教条主义的偏向。这样作的结果，收效是好的。
    （五）这次学习，我们的要求不高，总的要求是：一、对“辩证唯物主义”和“矛盾论”、“实践论”的理论要点有一个系统的概括的了解，为以后进一步学习马克思列宁主义理论及进行科学研究工作打下初步基础；二、初步培养起自学马克思列宁主义理论的兴趣和能力。在此要求下，凡是暂时可以不钻研的问题，都暂时撇开；如果在初学阶段钻研得太深太广，这只能满足少数人的欲望，大多数人将望而生畏。每一单元的学习时间也不宜太长，力求在比较短的时间内学到问题的全貌，使大家感到收获显著，增强大家的学习信心和兴趣；如果费时甚久而所得只是一鳞半爪，势必滋长厌倦疲沓情绪，这是应该注意防止的。
    （六）在学习方法上，我们坚持了“自学为主、讲解和讨论为辅”的方针，在独立钻研、独立思考的基础上，辅之以必要的启发报告和解答报告以及有准备的讨论。讲解和讨论的目的，在于指导和推动自学。这种方法证明是有效的。教师们认真阅读文件和写学习笔记的情况，远超过我们的估计，原定学习时间平均每周四小时半，实际大半都超过这个时数。其原因不仅在于教师们理解到要掌握理论就必须认真地阅读和钻研，而且在于高等学校教师具有自学的习惯和独立思考的能力，同时他们具有相当高度的文化水平和科学水平，对此我们必须有足够的估计。在高等学校教师中以作报告或开讨论会代替自学的方法，显然是不恰当的。
    讨论会的方式要灵活多样，但不管什么形式，必须要有中心，有准备，使之在充分自学的基础上进行，并能达到推动自学的目的。必须防止准备不足，漫无中心，废时旷日的讨论方式。
