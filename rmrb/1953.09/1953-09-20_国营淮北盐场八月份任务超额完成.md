    State-Run Northern Anhui Saltworks Exceeds August Quota
    The vast number of salt workers in the state-run Northern Anhui Saltworks area are engaged in intense autumn harvesting. In August of this year, they completed 227 percent of their production quota. Compared with the total salt production during the three months of autumn harvesting last year (August, September, and October), the salt production in August of this year alone nearly exceeded last year's total autumn harvest production by a factor of one. The salt quality also meets the prescribed standards.
    Before the autumn harvest, the saltworks held a cadre meeting to identify the reasons for the low spring harvest yield. They mobilized the masses to discuss the autumn harvest production plan and strengthened production and technical management. For example, the Guandong field felt that there was a shortage of labor under the dikes when arranging the autumn harvest tasks. They mobilized more than forty porters to take up work. The field also selected twenty-three cadres to form three work groups to take charge of the leadership of the five units. The Xintan, Guandong, and other fields basically ensured that the labor force was not dispersed. They made flood prevention preparations by the end of July and concentrated on production without affecting the principles of flood prevention. In terms of technical management, the saltworks previously did not pay much attention to the work of preventing and draining fresh water, and storing brine. Every year, a lot of brine and good water were diluted, which delayed the autumn harvest time. This year, the saltworks paid attention to this work. The fields universally mobilized workers to dig soil brine ponds, etc. The labor model Yang Ruzhi group of the Haoxi unit in the Tainan field built four soil brine ponds and drained the brine into the ponds in two days, scooping it up when the weather was good, advancing the salt production. The Honggang, Xintan, and Pugang units of the Guandong field produced more than 1,000 dan of salt in the unfavorable weather conditions of late July and early August because of the good work done in brine storage equipment.
    The saltworks also conducted patriotic labor competition education and consolidated labor discipline education for the salt workers. The political consciousness of the salt workers has been raised a step further, and their labor enthusiasm has become even higher. They said, "We produced less salt in the spring, so we must make up for this loss in the autumn harvest, create wealth for the country, and build our great motherland." At the beginning of this year's autumn harvest, it often rained in the Northern Anhui Saltworks, so there was a general lack of brine sources, which seriously affected the development of the autumn harvest. However, the vast number of salt workers improved their operating methods and used advanced experience to overcome this difficulty. The Tainan and Guandong fields also put forward the slogan "Be careful in flood prevention, be bold in collecting brine" among the vast number of salt workers, made preparations in advance, and filled 704 depressions (water storage ponds) with four decimeters of brine in one go during the flood season at the end of August. Other fields such as Taipei and Guanxi also obtained enough brine, solving the problem of brine shortage.
    At the beginning of September, the saltworks also conducted a major production inspection, correcting the phenomenon of yellowing and reddening of the brine in the salt pan of individual production teams, which affected the salt quality, and greatly promoted the development of the autumn harvest.
    At present, the state-run Northern Anhui Saltworks area has entered the intense stage of autumn harvesting. The salt workers are all seizing the good weather opportunities in a fighting posture, striving to produce more and better salt, and create more wealth for the country's planned economic construction.

### 国营淮北盐场八月份任务超额完成

    国营淮北盐场八月份任务超额完成
    国营淮北盐场区广大盐工正紧张地进行秋扫。今年八月份完成了生产任务百分之二百二十七，和去年秋扫八、九、十三个月产盐总数相比，今年秋扫单八月份产盐数，就将近超过去年秋扫八、九、十三个月产盐总数的一倍，盐质并能合乎规定的标准。
    该场在秋扫以前，召开了干部会议，找出春扫短产的原因，发动群众讨论了秋扫生产计划，加强了生产管理和技术管理的工作。如该场灌东场在布置秋扫任务时，感到圩下劳动力缺少，就动员了四十多个搬运工人抵工，场里并抽出二十三个干部，组成三个工作组分别掌握五个所的领导。新滩、灌东等场，基本上做到了劳动力不分散，在七月底就做好了防汛准备工作，在不影响防汛原则下，集中搞生产。在技术管理方面，该场以往对防淡、排淡、储卤设备等工作很不重视，每年总有很多卤水和好水被冲淡，以致推迟了秋扫时间。今年该场就重视了这一工作，各场普遍发动工人挖土卤塘等，台南场蒿西所劳动模范杨汝志小组弄了四个土卤塘，两天就把卤水赶进土卤塘，好天戽上来，提早了种盐。灌东场洪港、新滩、蒲港等所由于储卤设备工作做得好，在七月底和八月初的天时不好的情况下，都产了一千多担盐。
    该场又对盐工进行了爱国主义劳动竞赛的教育和巩固劳动纪律的教育，盐工的政治觉悟又较前提高一步，劳动热忱更加高涨，他们说：“我们春季产盐少，一定要在秋扫中捞起来，弥补这个损失，为国家创造财富，来建设我们伟大的祖国。”今年秋扫开始时，淮北盐场常下雨，因而普遍缺乏卤源，严重地影响了秋扫的开展。但是广大盐工，改进了操作方法和运用先进经验，克服了这一困难。台南、灌东两场并在广大盐工中提出了“防汛要细心，拿潮要大胆”的口号，事先做好准备工作，在八月底汛期一次就灌满了七百零四份洼地面（储水池），深达四公寸的潮水。其他台北、灌西等场也拿到了足够的潮水，解决了缺卤问题。
    该场区在九月初又进行一次生产大检查，纠正了个别生产小组晒格卤水发黄、发红影响盐质现象，也大大推动了秋扫工作的开展。
    目前国营淮北盐场区，已进入秋扫的紧张阶段，盐工们皆以战斗的姿态，抓紧好天时机，争取产更多更好的盐，为祖国有计划的经济建设创造更多的财富。（廖寿康、陈竞）
