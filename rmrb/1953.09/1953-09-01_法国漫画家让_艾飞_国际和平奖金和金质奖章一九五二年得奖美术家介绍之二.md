The 1952 winner of the World Peace Council's International Peace Gold Medal, Jean Effel, was originally named François Lejeune. Jean Effel is the pen name of this cartoonist. He was born in Paris in 1908.

In 1933, Jean Effel's cartoons were published in "Le Monde," edited by the French revolutionary writer and passionate anti-fascist Henri Barbusse, attracting attention from all sides. In the same year, he joined the "Le Canard Enchaîné" (a famous French satirical magazine) and worked for the magazine, creating cartoons. Since then, he has become a progressive French cartoonist. When World War II broke out, he ended his work at the newspaper and enlisted in the army, participating in the Belgian campaign and receiving a combat medal. Afterwards, he frequently created cartoons for various newspapers.

Since 1935, he has successively published many collections of political cartoons, such as "Colonel de la Rocque" (1936), "Refrain" (1936), "Nouveau Refrain" (1937), "The Day Without Foreigners" (1944), "Forty-Five Little Girls" (1945), "Forty-Five Degrees" (1945), "Drums, Anise and Organ" (1946), "Play Collection" (1946), etc.

He created many cartoons for various newspapers. From 1951 to 1952 alone, he published more than fifty cartoons on the theme of defending peace in "Action," "Les Lettres Françaises," and "L'Humanité."

The greatest advantage of Jean Effel's cartoons is that they consistently and vividly express the people's desire for peace. He is good at using simple and clear techniques to profoundly and sharply explain problems. He also has rich creativity in performance forms. His cartoons have a fresh and pleasing style, and readers can easily understand his creative intentions. Many of his cartoons are printed on postcards and circulated everywhere.

Jean Effel is not only a cartoonist, but also a passionate fighter for peace. Each of his cartoons contributes to the struggle to defend world peace. "Oppose wars of aggression and strive for lasting peace" – this is the purpose of his cartoon creation.
