Xinhua News Agency report:

    Volunteer Army units of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army recently held a number of art and performance festivals to review the achievements of the troops' wartime cultural activities.

    The performers participating in the festival were extensive, including commanders at all levels, combatants, truck drivers, cooks, nurses, doctors, and professional military art workers. The programs performed at the festival were varied and concise. Among them, singing and dancing were the most numerous. The soldiers said that dancing has three advantages: "It's good for regulating the spirit, good for exercising the body, and good for uniting comrades."

    The programs at the festivals held by various units have improved in quality compared to the past, and many programs have new creations. For example, the "Singing of Eternal Life of Duan Peiying" performed by a certain unit of the Volunteer Army broke through the rigid choral form of only singing without acting; "Hunan Fishermen's Song" adopted folk forms and incorporated folk tunes into the work.

    This festival shows that the cultural work of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army earnestly implemented the policy of "facing the company, serving the soldiers" and "comprehensively developing combat and mass cultural work." The broad masses of company soldiers and cadres at all levels expressed the rich combat life on the Korean front through artistic forms. During the festival, many soldiers' creations and performances were awarded prizes. For example, in a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, seven of the nineteen program awards were for programs performed by soldiers. Nine of the twenty-one performance and creation awards were also for soldiers. The "Transportation Dance," "Telephone Operator," "Health and Epidemic Prevention Quick Talk," "Comfort Goods," "Ambush," and "Liu Ming Squad Practicing Martial Arts" programs of the soldiers' performance team of a certain unit all reflected the rich life and combat reality of the troops. Soldiers have also improved in dance skills, mastery of musical instruments, and composition. Four of the seven song and dance program awards from a certain unit were created by soldiers. There were also two outstanding soldier accordion players among the individual awards. All branches of the military have creations and performances that reflect their different combat realities. For example, the "Transporting Ammunition to the Front" and "Yuan Gui Saves the Vehicle" performed by a certain logistics unit vividly reflected the abundance of the motherland's materials and the spirit of the transportation troops in overcoming all difficulties and working selflessly. "The Victory Flag 'Dingzi Mountain'," "Tank Advance Dance," "Steel Warrior Xu Jinyuan," "Heroic Telephone Operator," and other programs are all excellent works. These performances and creations vividly and profoundly reflected the Volunteer Army's vigorous morale in fighting to defend the motherland and defend peace.

    The festival also reviewed the achievements of the troops' cultural troupes in going deep into the companies, deep into the positions, and deep into the work sites to extensively carry out cultural activities in the battlefield companies. For example, the cultural troupe of a certain unit on the Shangganling front, in cooperation with the combat tasks of various periods, went deep into the troops to perform 945 times in eight months. Ten cultural team members traveled through 45 positions in 15 days, performed 59 shows, and performed 511 programs. In the intervals between performances, the cultural troupe members actively helped the troops carry out recreational activities. According to incomplete statistics, a cultural troupe of a certain unit has trained more than 1,200 recreational backbones in the company in the past six months.

    In order to further develop company entertainment activities in the future, some units also invited company entertainment backbones and soldiers to visit during the festival. During the festival, the performers participating in the festival held forums and exchanged experiences with each other. The cultural troupes of various units have given demonstration performances, and at the same time, they have organized touring performance teams with selected outstanding programs and actors to go deep into various units for extensive performances.

    志愿军各部队举行文艺观摩演出大会
    据新华社讯：中国人民志愿军各部队最近先后举行了许多文艺观摩演出大会，检阅部队在战争中文艺活动的成绩。
    参加会演的演员范围很广泛，包括各级指挥员、战斗员、汽车司机、炊事员、护士、医生以及专业的部队文艺工作人员。会演节目的形式多种多样，短小精悍。其中尤以歌舞为最多。战士们说舞蹈有三好：“调节精神好，锻炼身体好，团结同志好。”
    各部队会演的节目，在质量上都比过去提高了，并且不少的节目有了新的创造。如志愿军某部表演的“歌唱永垂不朽的段培英”突破了光唱不演的死板的合唱形式；“湖南渔歌”是采用了民间形式，并把民间曲调也融汇到作品中去。
    这次会演，表现中国人民志愿军的文艺工作认真地贯彻了“面向连队、为兵服务”、“全面发展战斗性群众性的文艺工作”的方针。广大的连队战士和各级干部通过文艺形式表现了朝鲜前线丰富的战斗生活。会演中，有许多战士的创作和表演得了奖。如志愿军某部十九个节目奖中，七个是战士演出的节目。二十一个表演奖和创作奖中也有九名是战士的。某部战士演出队的“运输舞”，“电话员”、“卫生防疫快板”、“慰问品”、“遭遇战”、“刘明队练武”等节目，都反映了部队丰富的生活和战斗实际。战士们在舞蹈技术、掌握乐器和作曲的水平上也有了提高。某部七个歌舞节目奖中有四个是战士创作的。在个人奖中还有两位出色的战士手风琴手。各兵种都有表现他们不同的战斗实际的创作和演出。如某部后勤部队演出的“把弹药运向前线”和“袁贵救车”，生动地反映出祖国物资的雄厚，运输部队克服一切困难和忘我劳动的精神。“胜利的旗帜‘丁字山’”、“坦克前进舞”、“钢铁战士徐进元”、“英雄的电话员”等节目，都是很好的作品。这些演出和创作都生动而深刻地反映了志愿军为保卫祖国、保卫和平而战斗的旺盛的士气。
    会演也检阅了部队文工团、队深入连队、深入阵地、深入工作现场，广泛的开展战地连队的文艺活动的成绩。如上甘岭前线的某部文工团、队，在八个月中，配合各时期的战斗任务，深入部队演出九百四十五次，有十个文工队队员在十五天走遍了四十五个阵地，演了五十九场，表演节目五百一十一个。在演出的间隙，文工团、队员积极帮助部队开展文娱工作。据不完全的统计，某部文工团半年来培养了连队的文娱骨干有一千二百多名。
    为进一步开展今后连队文娱活动，有的单位在会演中并邀请了各连队文娱骨干和战士来参观。在会演中，参加会演的演员纷纷举行座谈会，互相交流经验。各部队文工团、队都作了示范演出，同时将选出的优秀节目和演员组织巡回演出队，深入各部队作广泛的演出。
