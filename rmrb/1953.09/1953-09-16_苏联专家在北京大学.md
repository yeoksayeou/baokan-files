    Soviet Experts at Peking University
    Chen Jun
    At Peking University, teachers who work with Soviet experts all feel very fortunate because they have learned a lot from the Soviet experts, the most important of which is the quality that a people's teacher should possess. Many teachers say in unison that Soviet experts are our role models in every aspect.

    There are three Soviet experts at Peking University: Professor Borodin of the Marxist-Leninist Fundamentals Teaching and Research Group, Professor Gumachenko of the Political Economics Teaching and Research Group, and Associate Professor Borodina of the Russian Language and Literature Department. They never act like guests at Peking University; they work as if they were in their own country. When Professor Gumachenko first arrived in China, comrades in the Political Economics Teaching and Research Group asked him to rest for a few days before going to Peking University, but he wanted to go immediately, saying, "Stalin sent me to China to work, not to rest." Sometimes, comrades in the Teaching and Research Group would ask him if he could attend certain meetings, and he would say, "Don't just look at whether I can attend, but see if I need to attend. If needed, just notify me." Associate Professor Borodina once said to comrades in the Russian Language and Literature Department, "Give me as much work as possible; I will tell you when I can't handle it."

    The work of Soviet experts is serious, conscientious, and responsible. They attach great importance to ensuring the implementation of the teaching plan. Once, the Marxist-Leninist Fundamentals Teaching and Research Group encountered the following situation: because the teachers did not have enough time to write lectures, they were afraid that they would not be able to complete the teaching plan. The comrades in the Teaching and Research Group did not use their brains well to think of a solution and planned to make up for it by reducing classroom discussions. Professor Borodin disagreed with this approach. He said that in the process of implementing the teaching plan, many difficulties will be encountered, and we should actively find ways to overcome all surmountable difficulties. We are not allowed to rashly and passively modify the plan, causing losses to the students' learning. He suggested that teachers improve their methods of writing lectures; and suggested that for one week, the head of the Teaching and Research Group should lecture uniformly to three classes, so that other teachers could free up time to concentrate on writing lectures. The Teaching and Research Group adopted these suggestions, overcame the difficulty of insufficient time, and ensured the students' learning. The Soviet experts' serious and conscientious spirit towards the plan gave the comrades in the Teaching and Research Group a profound education, and they realized what attitude they should take towards the difficulties encountered in their work.

    In the past, teachers could lecture on things they did not understand, or even things they did not believe in. But today's teachers cannot do this at all. Take the Marxist-Leninist Fundamentals course as an example. The course itself requires teachers not only to master Marxism-Leninism, but also to embody Marxism-Leninism in their actions. Therefore, teachers must have a high degree of political cultivation, be loyal to revolutionary theory and cause, and never let go of any anti-Marxist erroneous views; only in this way can they help students improve their theoretical level. Professor Borodin is a good role model in this regard. Someone once asked him to introduce or explain the arguments of the Second International opportunism, and he immediately pointed out that this was an objectivist proposition without a stand. He said, "I can only introduce how Marx and Lenin criticized the views of opportunism. If I were to introduce the views of opportunism, then I would be a voluntary propagandist for reactionary views." Sometimes he pointed out that the way some teachers and graduate students asked questions was in the style of Mensheviks or Trotskyites. When he knew that the person being criticized felt uncomfortable, he said, "I will continue to do so in the future. I am not saying that he is a Menshevik or a Trotskyite, but that the way he asked the question belongs to their system. Only in this way can we point out the seriousness of the problem, and only then can we arouse the vigilance of the comrades, so that they will not make the same mistake in the future." This attitude of uncompromising struggle against erroneous views greatly moved the Chinese teachers who lectured on Marxist-Leninist Fundamentals. Teacher Zhang Shiying said, "The class I teach is composed of students majoring in editing. They are future Marxist-Leninist propagandists. If we don't teach them to criticize erroneous views now, it is very likely that their work will suffer in the future."

    Soviet experts closely watch the growth of students and teachers, and their concern for them is meticulous. The main task of teachers is teaching, and Professor Borodin strongly emphasized that teachers should "guarantee teaching and learning," and strive to ensure that everyone passes. Whoever's student fails is responsible. He said that when students do not come to the teacher, the teacher should go to the student. Teachers should use every means to help students and meet their teaching requirements. But these are all things that happen before the exam. During the exam, one should be meticulous, pass if one passes, and fail if one fails. Professor Borodin paid special attention to students from worker, peasant, Liberation Army and cadre backgrounds, and he emphasized that their learning must be especially guaranteed, otherwise it would be a political error.

    Some students in the Russian Language and Literature Department who were about to graduate were unwilling to become teachers, and Associate Professor Borodina often helped them and talked to them about the glory of being a teacher. She said that teachers are engineers of the soul, and when students look at you with confident eyes, it is the greatest joy. She herself had taught for more than 20 years, from elementary school teacher to university professor, and had always loved her career. Under her kind education, these students changed their erroneous views and were willing to obey the assignment. When a teaching assistant was about to give a trial lecture, Professor Gumachenko gave him a lot of encouragement. He said that in the Soviet Union, when an actor performs for the first time, the government will present him with flowers to congratulate him on the beginning of his artistic life, which gives the actor great encouragement. When a teacher is preparing to start a course, it means that his teaching life is about to begin, and everyone should congratulate him and encourage him.

    On the other hand, anything that is not conducive to the students' learning and does not think from the students' perspective is severely criticized by Soviet experts. Once, there was a quiz for the Marxist-Leninist Fundamentals course, and one teacher did not give the first student to take the exam sufficient preparation time, but ordered him to answer immediately after drawing the question. Professor Borodin was very angry when he learned about this. He said that this was an inhumane thing and was simply making things difficult for the student. Students have the right to ask for time to prepare the answer, and if this right is deprived, he can file a complaint. Some individual teachers in the Russian Language and Literature Department had a bad attitude towards students, mocking and satirizing students with poor performance. Associate Professor Borodina said angrily that this was not the attitude of a teacher at all.

    In teaching, Soviet experts highly emphasized the spirit of collectivism. At the beginning, the Marxist-Leninist Fundamentals Teaching and Research Group prepared lessons collectively in this way: first, the Teaching and Research Group would draft an outline of the lecture, and the lecturers would write their respective lectures based on this outline. Everyone had to write a lecture on the same chapter. After writing, everyone would meet to discuss and offer opinions to each other; then each person would revise his own lecture based on the opinions of others, and then formally lecture. Professor Borodin felt that this method was not good. He suggested that the lectures should be prepared jointly by everyone, with chapters written in rotation by one person each time. This can save time, give full play to collective wisdom, and improve teaching quality. But at that time, everyone did not pay attention to his opinion, always feeling that it was easier to lecture on things they wrote themselves, that is, they believed in themselves more than they believed in others and believed in the collective. Later, there was less and less time to write lectures, and they remembered to try the Soviet experts' suggestion, and the results were very good. Because there was only one person writing the lecture, other people could free up time to read more original works and other reference books, consider more questions, and constantly supplement the content of the lecture. In this way, the quality of teaching was greatly improved, and the students' response was very good. This is not only a change in the form of lesson preparation, but also a victory for the spirit of collectivism.

    Soviet experts attach great importance to serving the people wholeheartedly and carrying out Marxist-Leninist propaganda in various occasions without reservation; at the same time, they learn from the masses and constantly enrich their knowledge. Therefore, in addition to teaching, they all pay attention to social work. Professor Borodin and Professor Gumachenko are often invited to give reports outside the school. They each spend one morning a week talking to the principal, introducing various situations at Moscow University, and making suggestions on the school's facilities. After Associate Professor Borodina learned that Li Yuzhen, the head of the Russian Language and Literature Department Teaching and Research Group, was going to translate Mayakovsky's long poem "Lenin," she often gave him help and encouragement; after the translation was completed, she immediately congratulated him warmly. Li Yuzhen said, "With her, I have confidence in my work, otherwise I would not dare to translate this book."

    Soviet experts also pay attention to some small things in daily life, because students are watching every move of the teachers and are influenced by them. Professor Gumachenko said that a political teacher must pay attention to his lifestyle and strive to be rigorous in all aspects. Once, the lights went out when Professor Borodin was lecturing, and the translator comrade welded the candle to the table. Professor Borodin immediately said to him, "This is not a socialist attitude towards public property." He always combed his hair and tidied his clothes before entering the classroom. He said, "Don't give students a bad impression in terms of appearance."

    During the days of getting along with Soviet experts, the teachers of Peking University deeply felt that in all aspects, such as the attitude towards teaching work, the love and care for students and comrades, the importance attached to social work, and the attention to life details, Soviet experts are living examples for them to learn from. Their actions are a strong motivating force, infecting the comrades around them and powerfully promoting the work. Kalinin once said: "Of course, teaching a certain subject is the basic work, but in addition to this, students imitate teachers everywhere. Therefore, the teacher's worldview, his conduct, his life, and his attitude towards every phenomenon all influence the entire student body in this or that way. This is often imperceptible." ("Speech at the meeting of urban and rural outstanding teachers convened by the editorial department of the 'Teacher's Newspaper'") The teachers of Peking University who are with Soviet experts have a deeper understanding of this point.

    苏联专家在北京大学
    陈俊
    在北京大学，凡是和苏联专家在一起工作的教师都觉得十分幸福。因为他们从苏联专家那里学习了许多东西，其中最重要的，就是一个人民教师应当具备的品质。许多教师都异口同声地说，苏联专家无论在哪一方面都是我们的榜样。
    北京大学共有三位苏联专家，他们是马克思列宁主义基础教研组的鲍罗廷教授、政治经济学教研组的古马青珂教授和俄罗斯语言文学系的鲍罗廷娜副教授。他们在北京大学从来没有一点客人的表现，像在自己的国家里一样工作着。古马青珂教授初到中国时，政治经济学教研组的同志请他休息几天再到北京大学去，他却要马上就去，并且说：“斯大林是派我到中国来工作的，不是派我来休息的。”有时教研组的同志问他能不能参加某些会议，他说：“不要光看我能不能参加，而要看是不是需要我参加。假如需要，你们只管通知我好了。”鲍罗廷娜副教授曾对俄罗斯语言文学系的同志说，把工作尽量交给我，负担不了时我会告诉你们的。
    苏联专家的工作是严肃、认真、负责的。他们十分重视教学计划的保证执行。有一次，马克思列宁主义基础教研组遇到了这样的情况：因为教师写讲稿的时间不够，恐怕不能完成授课计划，教研组的同志们没有很好地开动脑筋去想办法，就打算用缩减课堂讨论的方法来补救。鲍罗廷教授不同意这种作法。他说，在执行教学计划中，是会遇到很多困难的，应该积极想办法，克服一切可以克服的困难，不允许轻率地消极地修改计划，使同学们的学习受到损失。他建议教师们改善写讲稿的方法；并建议在一个星期内三个班由教研组主任统一授课，使其他的教师腾出时间来集中力量写讲稿。教研组采纳了这些意见，克服了时间不够的困难，保证了同学们的学习。苏联专家这种对待计划的严肃和认真的精神，给了教研组的同志们很深刻的教育，他们体会到应该用什么态度对待在工作中所遇到的困难。
    在过去，教师可以讲授自己不理解的、甚至是自己不相信的东西。但是现在的教师完全不能这样。拿马克思列宁主义基础这门课来说吧，课程本身要求教师不但要掌握马克思列宁主义，并且要在行动上体现马克思列宁主义。因此，教师要有高度的政治修养，要忠实于革命的理论和事业，决不放过一切反马克思主义的错误观点；这样才能帮助同学提高理论水平。鲍罗廷教授在这方面就是很好的表率。曾经有人请他介绍或解释第二国际机会主义的论点，他马上指出这是没有立场的客观主义的提法。他说：“我只能介绍马克思和列宁怎样批判机会主义的观点。要是我去介绍机会主义的观点，那我就做了反动观点的义务宣传员。”有时他指出一些教师和研究生提问题的方法是孟什维克或是托洛茨基派的方法。当他知道受批评的人感到不好过时，他说：“以后我还要这样做。我不是说他就是孟什维克或是托洛茨基派，而是说他的问题的提法是属于它们的体系。这样才能指出问题的严重性，才能引起同志们的警惕，使他们今后不犯同样的错误。”这种对错误观点进行不调和斗争的态度，使讲授马克思列宁主义基础的中国教师很受感动。教师张世英说：“我教的那班是编辑专业的同学，他们是未来的马克思列宁主义宣传员。要是现在不教会他们批判错误观点，将来就很可能使他们的工作受到损失。”
    苏联专家密切地注视着学生和教师的成长，对他们的关切无微不至。教师的主要工作是教学，鲍罗廷教授十分强调教师应该“包教包会”，要争取做到人人及格。谁的学生不及格由谁负责。他说同学不来找教师时，教师应当去找同学。教师应当用尽一切办法去帮助同学，满足他们的教学要求。但是这些都是考试前的事。在考试时就应该一丝不苟，及格就给及格，不及格就给不及格。鲍罗廷教授特别关心工人、农民、解放军和干部出身的学生，他强调要特别保证他们的学习，否则就是政治上的错误。
    俄罗斯语言文学系有些快毕业的同学不愿意当教师，鲍罗廷娜副教授经常帮助他们，跟他们谈做教师的光荣。她说，教师是灵魂的工程师，当学生们用充满信心的眼睛看着你时，这就是最大的愉快。她自己从小学教师一直到大学教授，一共教了二十多年书，始终热爱着自己的事业。这些同学在她的亲切的教育下，都改变了自己的错误观点，愿意服从分配。一位助教要试讲了，古马青珂教授给他许多鼓励。他说，在苏联，当一个演员头一次演出时，政府会给他献花，祝贺他艺术生活的开始，这给演员很大的鼓舞。一个教师准备开课，这就是说，他的教学生活快要开始了，大家应当祝贺他，鼓励他。
    另一方面，凡是不利于同学的学习和不从同学方面着想的事，都受到苏联专家的严厉批判。有一次，马克思列宁主义基础这门课举行测验，有一位教师没有给第一个应考的同学以充分的准备时间，而令其抽题后立即回答。鲍罗廷教授知道这件事后非常生气。他说这是不近人情的事，简直是和学生为难。学生有权利要求给他准备答案的时间，要是这种权利遭到剥夺，他可以提出控诉。俄罗斯语言文学系有个别教员对同学的态度不好，嘲笑、讽刺程度较差的同学。鲍罗廷娜副教授气愤地说这根本不是教师的态度。
    在教学中，苏联专家非常强调集体主义精神。马克思列宁主义基础教研组开始时是这样集体备课的：先由教研组拟出一个讲稿的提纲，讲课的教师根据这个提纲分别去写各自的讲稿，同一章节，每人都要写一遍。写好后大家开会讨论、互相提意见；然后各人参照别人的意见，把自己的讲稿修改后，正式讲课。鲍罗廷教授觉得这种方式不好，他建议讲稿由大家共同准备，分章轮流来写，每次只需一人执笔。这样可以节省时间、发挥集体智慧、提高教学质量。但是当时大家没有重视他的意见，总觉得自己讲自己写的东西比较顺当，也就是说相信自己比相信别人、相信集体要多。后来写讲稿的时间越来越不够了，他们才想起试行苏联专家的建议，结果收效很好。因为写讲稿的只要一个人，其他的人就可以抽出时间多看原著和其他参考书，可以多考虑问题，不断地补充讲稿的内容。这样，教学的质量大大提高了，同学们的反应非常好。这不单是备课形式的改变，而且是集体主义精神的胜利。
    苏联专家很重视在各种不同的场合中把自己所学的一切东西毫无保留地去为人民服务，去进行马克思列宁主义的宣传；同时向群众学习，不断地丰富自己的知识。因此，除了教学以外，他们都很注重社会工作。鲍罗廷教授和古马青珂教授常常应邀到校外作报告。他们每星期各抽一个上午和校长谈话，介绍莫斯科大学的各种情况，对学校的设施提出意见。鲍罗廷娜副教授在知道俄罗斯语言文学系教研组主任李毓珍要翻译马雅可夫斯基的长诗“列宁”后，经常给他帮助和鼓励；翻译完成后，马上向他热烈地祝贺。李毓珍说：“有了她，对工作就有了信心，不然的话我就不敢译这本书了。”
    苏联专家也很注意日常生活中的一些小事，因为学生是注视着教师的每一个动作，并受到它们的影响的。古马青珂教授说，一个政治教员一定要注意生活作风，要在各方面都力求严谨。有一次鲍罗廷教授在讲课时电灯灭了，翻译同志把腊烛焊在桌上。鲍罗廷教授马上对他说：“这不是对待公共财物的社会主义态度。”他在走进教室前一定梳梳头发、整理一下衣服。他说，不要在仪表上给学生一个不良的印象。
    在和苏联专家相处的日子里，北京大学的教师们深切地感到，无论是对待教学工作的态度、对同学和同志的爱护和关怀、对社会工作的重视、对生活细节的留意等各个方面，苏联专家都是他们学习的活的榜样。他们的行动就是强烈的鼓动力量，感染了周围的同志，有力地推动了工作。加里宁曾说过：“当然，教授某一门功课，这是基本工作，但除此之外，学生们还处处模仿教师。所以说，教师的世界观，他的品行，他的生活，他对每一现象的态度都这样或那样地影响着全体学生。这一点往往是觉察不出的。”（“在‘教师报’编辑部所召集的城乡优等教师会议上的讲演”）这一点，和苏联专家在一起的北京大学的教师们，有着更深的体会。
