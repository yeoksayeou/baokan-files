Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw: According to Tass, the Polish people enthusiastically celebrated the annual Harvest Festival on the 6th. In the famous Polish city of Szczecin, a grand celebration was held. More than 5,000 farmers from all over the country participated in the celebration. Government personnel headed by Polish People's Republic Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Bolesław Bierut, leaders of the Polish United Workers' Party, and representatives of various social organizations attended the celebration.

Chairman Bierut delivered a speech at the meeting. He pointed out that due to the implementation of land reform and the enormous assistance given to farmers by the People's Government, tremendous changes have taken place in the Polish countryside. He said that today, People's Poland's industry is capable of supplying the countryside with all kinds of the latest agricultural machinery and artificial fertilizers. The production of these machines and fertilizers is increasing year by year, and will soon be able to fully meet the needs of agriculture. At the same time, the number of agricultural experts trained by Polish agricultural colleges and specialized agricultural schools is also increasing year by year. All this has created the necessary conditions for the further development of Polish agriculture and animal husbandry. Bierut concluded by saying that increasing agricultural production is the cause of the people of the whole country, and the common task of the fraternal alliance of workers and farmers.

After the celebration, a mass parade was held.

On the eve of the Harvest Festival—September 5th—a national conference of agricultural advanced workers was held in Szczecin. More than 3,500 individual farmers, members of agricultural production cooperatives, workers of machine tractor stations and state farms from all over Poland exchanged work experience at the conference and formulated methods for further improving agricultural production. Polish Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Zenon Nowak, reported on the current achievements of People's Poland's agriculture at the conference. He said that 14,000 villages in People's Poland have been electrified. 25,000 libraries, more than 1,000 cinemas, 2,000 broadcasting stations, and thousands of schools, clubs, and other cultural and educational institutions have been established in rural areas. Agricultural production cooperatives are also developing rapidly. Many individual farmers and members of agricultural production cooperatives who spoke at the meeting expressed their determination to strive for abundant agricultural products and for the peace and happiness of all mankind.
