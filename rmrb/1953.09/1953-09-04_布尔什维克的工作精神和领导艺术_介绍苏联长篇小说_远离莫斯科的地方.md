    The Bolshevik Work Ethic and Art of Leadership
    ——Introducing the Soviet Novel "Far From Moscow"
    Liu Liaoyi, translated by Liu Liaoyi and Xie Sutai, published by People's Literature Publishing House

    "Far From Moscow" is one of the most outstanding works of Soviet literature created after the war. The novel's author, Azhayev, uses the theme of building national defense industries to depict people educated by the Bolshevik Party who possess the spirit of Soviet patriotism. They complete the tasks assigned by the Party and the government with a creative spirit that can overcome everything. At the same time, it demonstrates the Bolshevik art of leadership and provides profound education.

    The novel immediately leads the reader into a tense environment. The Soviet Great Patriotic War had just begun, and the government put forward a task: in order to counter a possible attack by Japanese imperialism, the Far East oil pipeline, originally scheduled to be completed in three years, must be completed within one year. The government sent new leaders, headed by Batmanov, to take over the work of the old leaders who lacked confidence in completing the new task. However, the Engineering Administration was a demoralized and inefficient organization. Many people wanted to leave, feeling that the war did not need this oil pipeline thousands of kilometers away from the front lines. When the motherland was in crisis and the beloved capital Moscow was under serious threat from the German invaders, people believed that only fighting on the front lines could fulfill the sacred duty of a Soviet citizen. The former administrative director, Rogov, and even the young engineer Alexei, who came with Batmanov to take over the administration, were very emotional and rebellious because of this. This is one type of problem. There is another more serious problem: some people, clinging to outdated technical concepts, simply did not believe that the oil pipeline could be completed in one year. The former chief engineer, Grubsky, is a representative of this type of person.

    Amidst these complex contradictions, the author describes some figures with noble qualities. These figures hold different positions, but their roles in this arduous task are equally important and equally worthy of people's respect and love.

    The author portrays the image of a new type of engineer like Beridze. He does not worship foreign "authorities" like the former chief engineer Grubsky. He wants to use his own inventions and creations to overthrow the foreign "authorities'" assertion that construction cannot be carried out in winter, because Siberia has seven months of winter out of twelve months a year. How can people be willing to "sit in the office for a long time and give the line to the wind and snow without a fight?" He unhesitatingly began to re-formulate the plan to implement the government's decision. He realized that the oil pipeline was needed for the war, so he decided to complete the construction in one year. This is equivalent to an order - to persevere and complete it at all costs. Here, the author shows the new qualities of the Soviet people. Completing the tasks assigned by the state is the highest civic duty for them, and everything must be subordinate to the needs of the state and the people. Regardless of all difficulties, Beridze finally found a way to solve the task, overturned Grubsky's outdated technical principles, and formulated a technical plan for winter construction. Another decisive step for completing the plan was to move the route of laying the oil pipeline from the right bank of the Adon River to the left bank, which was in line with the wishes of the people. A local fisherman, the collective farm chairman Karpov, had proposed this plan long ago, but the leaders of the project at the time did not listen to the voice of the people, so this suggestion was suppressed in the archives.

    In this struggle between the new and the old, the victory was won by Beridze's side, while Grubsky, an individualist who resisted the demands of the state and the people and opposed the collective, suffered an inevitable defeat.

    Communications engineer Danya is a brave Communist Youth League member who is loved by everyone. The old leaders had rejected her proposal to install communication equipment in the construction project and transferred her to a distant engineering section. The new director Batmanov attached great importance to communication equipment. He asked Danya if she could open a training class and spend three months repairing the temporary telephone lines. Danya had already thought about this matter as her own, saying that she would train the communicators directly in the actual work. The telephone line to the farthest engineering section - Taixin Island - could be erected in just one and a half months. It was she who, with a group of young people, erected the telephone lines in the severe cold and snowstorms and in the boundless forests.

    These new types of heroes, from the director, the Party committee secretary, the chief engineer to the ordinary technicians, workers, and drivers, are the true masters of the new life. The common ideal of fighting for communism unites them into a strong collective, and their images are equally moving. They not only work consciously and selflessly, but also strive to do it faster, more, and better. This creative Bolshevik work ethic is also one of the important characteristics of the Soviet people. The labor achievements of many characters in the novel, such as the driver Makhov's rationalization proposal for transporting oil pipes, the advanced experience of the excavator Gachkov, Karpov's suggestion for moving the line, and Umara's completion of 350% of the welding task, all demonstrate this spirit.

    The Bolshevik work ethic is built on the foundation of collectivism. People unite and love each other in collective labor, helping each other and using the weapons of criticism and self-criticism to overcome obstacles on the road forward. Criticism and self-criticism have become a habit for the protagonists in the novel. The director and the Party committee secretary often use this weapon to overcome shortcomings in their work. Danya also saw this characteristic in the young engineer Alexei: he openly, without anger or resistance, accepted criticism from others. Danya said: "He is happy when people scold him." Alexei's view is: "As long as the scolding is right, it is a great thing." "...When people scold you like this, you can see the shortcomings you didn't discover before more clearly...". Azhayev convincingly demonstrates the power of collective labor in the novel. The great achievements of individual heroes are unimaginable without this Soviet collective. At the same time, he also tells us that the reason why this collective labor can exert such great power is inseparable from the Bolshevik art of leadership. The author's success in describing this aspect constitutes one of the most important features of this novel.

    The author, with his keen observation and ingenious plot, demonstrates all aspects of the Bolshevik art of leadership through figures such as Batmanov and Party Committee Secretary Zelkind.

    Batmanov is a typical Bolshevik leader. He is clear-headed and good at grasping the main problems in his work and dealing with them decisively. He is very strict with his cadres, but he readily entrusts them with major tasks that seem to exceed his own abilities. He believes that the people cultivated by the Soviet regime have unlimited potential and that this will further strengthen their sense of responsibility. When assigning work to cadres, Batmanov let a transportation engineer, Filimonov, lead the automotive mechanical department, preemptively preventing his opposition, saying:

    "Do you want to say that the scale here is a hundred times larger? A person should move from small-scale work to large-scale work. To be honest with you, I will have even greater demands on you in the future."

    Danya's suggestion to train communicators in actual work was a bold plan, but Batmanov approved it. She began to strictly lead her team to set up telephone lines in the great forest in a blitzkrieg manner; they overcame unimaginable difficulties and created new records in their work. Batmanov not only did not praise her, but criticized her in front of the team for not completing the task 100%. Danya initially felt wronged, saying: "Why does he always attack people? Is this his method?" But Youth League Secretary Smirnov and young engineer Alexei immediately guessed Batmanov's intention: he wanted to use his strictness towards Danya to prove that Danya's strictness towards the team members was correct.

    Combining leadership with the masses is the main source of Bolshevik leadership power. Batmanov believes that without the engineers and all the personnel, he is just a "commander without an army." Not understanding this is like a person sitting on a tree branch and starting to cut off the branch. The novel describes a typical figure of bureaucratic leaders. The head of the engineering section, Yefimov, is loyal to his work. He works day and night, even moving into the office to live, making him haggard and exhausted. He thinks he is about to die. He wants to replace a thousand hands and five hundred healthy brains with his two hands and a stupid head, and the work is ruined. He regards his subordinates as pawns and does not trust anyone. Party Committee Secretary Zelkind angrily said that he "does not understand the important truth that all the strength is in the collective." Zelkind also mentioned another leading cadre: "...Derekhov always has a clean shave, looks energetic, and wears new clothes - sitting in the office like it's his birthday. He doesn't want to die either, because he knows that the Party and the country need smart and healthy workers to defeat the enemy...."

    The author also describes how the leaders of the administration promptly prevented the tendency of individual heroism from appearing in individual cadres. Rogov, who later became the head of the engineering section, had such a tendency. An individual hero first thinks about showing himself, so the harm to the work is also very great. Zelkind criticized this kind of person, saying that a capable and outstanding person who is trusted by the Party becomes a leader. Often at the beginning of the period of doing leadership work, everything goes normally. Subsequently, this comrade loses contact with his source of strength, and the work will fail. He no longer understands; without the people, without the group, without the Party, he is just an insignificant person. The individual hero believes that he is the source of strength and the cause of all success.

    Azhayev calls his novel "Far From Moscow" a poetic and artistic production report. This is a very appropriate statement. In this novel, the author not only describes construction work, but also focuses on the life of the Soviet people, a vivid and colorful life, a happy labor life that rejoices for the construction of the motherland. The author successfully portrays the artistic images of Batmanov, Zelkind, Beridze, Alexei, Danya, and others who are worthy of being role models and objects of emulation.

    The people on various construction fronts in the new China will find many valuable inspirations and the experience they need from this book.

### 布尔什维克的工作精神和领导艺术——介绍苏联长篇小说“远离莫斯科的地方”

    布尔什维克的工作精神和领导艺术
    ——介绍苏联长篇小说“远离莫斯科的地方”
    刘辽逸
    阿札耶夫著    刘辽逸、谢素台译    人民文学出版社出版
    “远离莫斯科的地方”是战后苏联文艺创作中最杰出的作品之一。小说的作者阿札耶夫通过建设国防工业的题材，刻划了布尔什维克党教养出来的、具有苏维埃爱国主义精神的人们，他们用可以战胜一切的创造精神完成党和政府交给的任务；同时表现了布尔什维克的领导艺术，给人以深刻的教育。
    小说一开头，就把读者引导到一个紧张的环境里。苏联伟大卫国战争刚开始，政府提出了一个任务：为了迎击日本帝国主义可能的进攻，原定三年才能修好的远东输油管，必须在一年内完成它。政府派了以巴特曼诺夫为首的新的领导者们去接替对完成新的任务没有信心的旧的领导者的工作。可是，工程管理局是一个人心涣散、工作效率极低的机构。很多人都想走，觉得战争并不需要这条离前线数千公里的输油管。当祖国处在危急关头、心爱的首都莫斯科遭到德寇严重威胁的时候，人们认为只有在前线作战才是尽到了苏联公民的天职。前任行政处长罗戈夫、甚至跟巴特曼诺夫一块来接收管理局的青年工程师阿列克塞，都因此闹情绪闹得很厉害。这是一类问题。还有另一类更严重的问题，有一部分人抱着陈腐的技术观念，根本不相信一年能修好输油管。前任总工程师格鲁布斯基是这一类人物的代表。
    就在这些错综复杂的矛盾中，作者描写了一些具有高尚品质的人物。这些人物各有不同职务，但他们在这个艰苦的任务中的作用，是同样重要、同样值得人们尊敬和热爱的。
    作者刻划了别里捷这样的新型工程师的形象。他不像前任总工程师格鲁布斯基那样崇拜外国“权威”，他要用自己的发明创造来推翻外国“权威”认为冬季不能施工的说法，因为西伯利亚一年十二个月就有七个月是冬天，怎能使人甘心“长期坐在办公室里，线路也就不战而送给大风雪”呢？他毫不迟疑地着手重新拟定实现政府决议的计划。他认识到输油管为战争所需要，因此才决定一年建筑完成。这就等于命令——拚死也要坚持完成。作者在这里显示了苏维埃人的新品质，完成国家交下的任务，一切都要服从国家人民的需要，这对他们来说，是最高的公民义务。别里捷不顾一切困难，终于找到了解决任务的出路，推翻了格鲁布斯基的陈腐的技术原则，拟定了冬季施工的技术方案。他的另一个对完成计划有决定意义的步骤，就是把敷设输油管的路线从阿东河的右岸移到左岸，这是与人民的愿望一致的。一个当地的渔夫、集体农庄主席卡尔波夫早就提出过这个方案，但当时工程的领导人不去倾听人民的声音，以致这个建议就被压到档案库里了。
    在这场新与旧的斗争中，获得胜利的是别里捷这一方面，而抗拒国家人民的要求、与集体闹对立的个人主义者格鲁布斯基则遭到了必然的失败。
    通讯工程师丹妮亚是一个为大家所敬爱的勇敢的共产主义青年团员。旧的领导人曾拒绝了她的关于在建筑工程中安设通讯设备的建议，并且把她调到远远的工程段上去。新局长巴特曼诺夫对于通讯设备非常重视。他问丹妮亚能不能开个训练班，用上三个月的工夫把临时电线修好。丹妮亚却以主人翁的态度早把这件事想好了，她说要直接在实际工作中训练通讯员到最远的工程段——台辛岛的电线只要一个半月就可以拉起来。正是她，带着一群年青人，在严寒的大风雪里，在漫无边际的大森林里，架好了电线。
    这些新型的英雄们，从局长、党委书记、总工程师直到普通的技术工人、汽车司机，都是新的生活的真正主人翁，为共产主义而奋斗的共同理想使他们团结成一个坚强的集体，他们的形象都是同样动人的。他们，不仅是自觉地、奋不顾身地工作，而且是努力想做得更快、更多、更好。这种创造性的布尔什维克的工作精神，也是苏维埃人的重要特质之一。小说中许多人物的劳动功绩，如司机马霍夫对运输油管的合理化建议，挖土工人加奇可夫的先进经验，卡尔波夫对于移动线路的建议，乌马拉完成焊工任务的百分之三百五十，都表现了这种精神。
    布尔什维克的工作精神，是建立在集体主义的基础上的。人们在集体的劳动中团结友爱，互相帮助，用批评与自我批评的武器来克服前进道路上的障碍。小说中的主人公们进行批评与自我批评已经成了习惯。局长和党委书记两个人就是经常用这个武器来克服工作中的缺点的。丹妮亚在年青的工程师阿列克塞身上也看出了这个特点：他公开地、毫不动怒和毫无抗拒地接受别人的批评。丹妮亚说：“人家骂他呢，他反倒高兴。”而阿列克塞的看法则是：“只要骂得对，就是一件了不起的事。”“……当人们这样责骂你的时候，你对你以前没有发现的缺点看得更清楚了……”。阿札耶夫在小说中富有说服力地表现了集体劳动的力量。个别英雄的丰功伟绩离开这个苏维埃集体是不可想像的。同时他也告诉我们：这个集体劳动之所以能发挥如此巨大的力量，是与布尔什维克的领导艺术分不开的。作者在这方面描写的成功，构成了这部小说最重要的特色之一。
    作者用他那深刻的观察、巧妙的情节，通过巴特曼诺夫和党委书记泽尔肯德等人物，表现了布尔什维克领导艺术的各个方面。
    巴特曼诺夫是一个典型的布尔什维克领导人物。他头脑清醒，善于抓住工作中的主要问题而予以果断的处理。他对干部要求非常严格，但他放手交给干部那些看来是超越他本人能力的重大工作；他相信苏维埃政权培养出来的人是有无限潜在力量的，相信这样更能加强他们的责任感。在分配干部工作时，巴特曼诺夫让一个运输工程师费里蒙诺夫领导汽车机械处，预先阻止了他的反对，说：
    “您是不是想说：这儿的规模要大一百倍？一个人应当从小规模的工作走到大规模的工作的。不瞒您说：我将来对您的要求还要更大呢。”
    丹妮亚建议在实际工作中训练通讯员，这是一个大胆的计划，可是巴特曼诺夫批准了。她开始严格地领导着自己的队员们在大森林中用突击方式架设电线；他们克服了难以想像的艰难困苦，在工作上创造了新纪录。巴特曼诺夫不但没有夸奖她，反而当着队员的面批评她没有百分之百地完成任务。丹妮亚起先觉得受了委屈，她说：“为什么他总对人进攻，难道这就是他的方法吗？”而青年团书记斯米尔诺夫和青年工程师阿列克塞却立刻猜透巴特曼诺夫的用意，他是要用他对丹妮亚的严厉，来证明丹妮亚对队员们的严厉是正确的。
    领导与群众相结合，是布尔什维克领导力量的主要源泉。巴特曼诺夫认为没有工程师们和全体人员，他只是一个“光杆将军”，不了解这一点，就像一个人坐在树枝上，却动手砍起这树枝一样。小说中曾描写了事务主义的领导者的典型人物。工程段段长叶菲莫夫对工作是忠心耿耿的，他日以继夜地工作，甚至搬到办公室里住，弄得憔悴不堪，他认为自己快要完蛋了。他想以他那两只手和一颗蠢脑袋代替一千只手和五百个健全的脑袋，工作就给搞垮了。他把部下都看成小卒，对谁也不信任。党委书记泽尔肯德愤怒地说他“不懂得全部力量都在集体这个重要的道理”。泽尔肯德并提到另一个领导干部：“……杰列霍夫总是胡子剃得光光的，精神抖抖的，穿着新衣裳——坐在办公室里像过生日似的。他也不想去死，因为他知道为了战胜敌人，党和国家是需要聪明而且健康的工作人员的。……”
    作者也描写了管理局的领导者，怎样及时地防止了个别干部身上显露的个人英雄主义倾向。后来担任工程段段长的罗戈夫就曾有过这样的倾向。一个个人英雄主义者首先想到的是表现自己，所以对工作的危害性也是很大的。泽尔肯德批评这种人说，一个有能力的受到党的信任的出色人物当了领导人。往往在开始做领导工作的时期，一切都进行得正常。随后这位同志和他的力量源泉失掉了联系，工作就要失败。他再也不理解；若是没有人民，没有团体，没有党，他只不过是一个毫不足取的人。个人英雄主义者相信自己是力量的泉源，是一切成功的原因。
    阿札耶夫把自己的小说“远离莫斯科的地方”称为诗化的、艺术化的长篇生产报告。这是很恰当的说法。作者在这部小说中，不仅描写了建设工作，而且更着重地描写了苏联人民的生活，生动的、富有色彩的生活，为祖国的建设而欢欣鼓舞的、幸福的劳动生活。作者成功地刻划了巴特曼诺夫、泽尔肯德、别里捷、阿列克塞、丹妮亚等值得做别人的模范和效仿对象的艺术形象。
    新中国各种建设战线上的人们，将从这本书里找到许多宝贵的启发和他们所需要的经验。
