Reader's Letters Abstract:

    The Affiliated Hospital of Hebei Medical College Should Immediately Improve Environmental Sanitation
    Letters from Liu Yu and Shi Fengwen of the Affiliated Hospital of Hebei Medical College: The environmental sanitation of the Affiliated Hospital of Hebei Medical College is too poor. There is a large pit behind the hospital where all the dirty water accumulates, emitting a foul odor and breeding mosquitoes, which is very harmful to the health of nearby residents. Local residents have raised objections, but the hospital has not resolved the issue. The hospital is overgrown with tall grass everywhere. The flush toilets in the restrooms are broken and not repaired. The outpatient department, wards, and operating rooms are also not clean.
    It is highly inappropriate for a hospital to be so dirty. The hospital leadership must pay attention to this issue and immediately improve environmental sanitation.

    河北医学院附属医院应即改善环境卫生
    河北医学院附属医院刘钰、石奉文来信：河北医学院附属医院的环境卫生太坏了。医院后面有一个大水坑，所有脏水都流蓄在这里，臭气四溢，蚊子丛生，对附近群众的健康危害很大。当地群众曾提过意见，医院也不予解决。医院里到处长满很高的草。厕所的抽水马桶坏了不修理。门诊部、病房和手术室也不清洁。
    一个医院这么脏，这是非常不应该的。医院的领导方面必须重视这个问题，立即改善环境卫生。
