    The State-Owned Jinan Department Store Purchasing and Supply Station still clings to the idea of solely pursuing famous brands in its business operations, neglecting to explore local sources of goods and support local industrial production. Since the beginning of the third quarter, although the station has begun to pay attention to actively organizing sources of goods, expanding commodity circulation, and preparing for the peak season after autumn, under the continuous instructions of higher-level companies, it still blindly pursues popular goods from outside the province and is unwilling to deal in products from within the province. For example, in the third quarter, the station's processing and purchasing figures within the province only accounted for one-third of the goods purchased from outside the province. Among this one-third of intra-provincial purchases, matches, paper, and boiled green beans accounted for two-thirds, while daily necessities, which account for a large quantity in production, accounted for a very small proportion, and have only completed about 50% of the purchase plan to date. These daily necessities are mostly products of local industries and handicrafts in Jinan, with a large production volume, and although the quality is not as high as goods from Shanghai, they are suitable for the vast rural areas. However, the Jinan Department Store Purchasing and Supply Station subjectively believes that these products "have no sales" and "are troublesome to manage." Therefore, when arranging the purchase plan, these products are often overlooked. For example, the number of towels produced in Jinan is very large and very suitable for rural needs. In the third quarter, the Provincial Department Store originally planned to have the station process 33,000 dozens. The Jinan Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce suggested 30,000 dozens, but the station changed it to 27,000 dozens without asking for instructions. Even with this number, the station is still not active in purchasing, and the task was not completed until mid-August. Furthermore, Jinan can produce 20,000 to 30,000 dozens of socks per month, but the station is always afraid that there will be no sales and is not actively processing them. Recently, the Jining Department Store Wholesale Station came to order 10,000 dozens of Jinan socks. At that time, the Jinan Department Store Purchasing and Supply Station did not have such goods. It should have faced up to this problem and actively expanded processing, but the station said in turn that it was abnormal for the Jining Department Store Wholesale Station to order so many intra-provincial products at one time, and because there were not many provincial socks in stock, it was hesitant to sign a contract with the Jining Department Store Wholesale Station. Because the station is not enthusiastic about operating local industrial products, it usually lacks investigation and research on the production and sales of local industrial products, often resulting in blind passivity in operation. For example, wool socks are seasonal commodities. Every off-season, the production of some knitting industries in Jinan is very difficult, while in the peak season, the phenomenon of supply exceeding demand often occurs. However, the station did not start from adjusting off-season and peak season production and solving the difficulties of local industrial production, but simply circled around its own business needs. As a result, it did not process at all in the first and second quarters of this year, and only started to organize processing in July, affecting the normal production of the knitting industry in Jinan.
    Recently, under the instructions and help of higher-level leaders, the station has conducted a review of the problems of neglecting to support local industries and being unwilling to actively organize intra-provincial purchases, and has formulated rectification measures. However, further implementation requires effort.

### 国营济南百货采购供应站  忽视扶持地方工业不注意组织地方货源

    国营济南百货采购供应站
    忽视扶持地方工业不注意组织地方货源
    国营济南百货采购供应站，目前在经营业务上仍然存在着单纯追逐名牌货的思想，不注意开辟地方货源，扶持地方工业生产。进入第三季度以来，该站在上级公司的不断指示下，对积极组织货源、扩大商品流通，迎接秋后旺季，虽已开始重视，但依然盲目追求省外热销货，不愿意经营省内产品。如第三季度该站省内的加工收购数字，只占省外进货的三分之一，这三分之一省内进货中火柴、纸张、煮青等三项物资即占去三分之二，而在生产上占很大数量的日用百货，却占着很小的比重，且到目前只完成了进货计划的百分之五十左右。这些日用百货大都是济南市地方工业及手工业产品，有很大的生产量，虽然质量不如上海货高，但适销于广大农村。而济南百货采购供应站却主观地认为这些产品“没销路”、“经营起来麻烦”。因此在安排进货计划时，对这些产品常不放在眼里。如济南市出产的毛巾，数量很大，也很适合农村需要，第三季度省百货公司原确定要该站加工三万三千打，济南市工商局的意见是三万打，而该站不经请示却私自改为两万七千打。就是这个数字，该站在收购上仍不积极，直到八月中旬还没完成任务。又如济南市每月能生产两万至三万打袜子，但该站老是害怕没有销路不积极进行加工。最近济宁百货批发站来要一万打济南袜子，当时济南百货采购供应站没有这类货，本应正视这一问题，并积极扩大加工，但该站却反过来说济宁百货批发站一次要这么多的省内产品是不正常的现象，并因本省袜子库存不多，迟迟不敢和济宁百货批发站签订合同。由于该站对地方工业产品经营不热心，所以平时对地方工业品的产销情况也就缺乏调查研究，常造成经营上的盲目被动。如绒袜是季节性商品，每逢淡季济南市的一些针织业生产都很困难，而到旺季又常发生供不应求的现象。但该站却没有从调剂淡旺季生产，解决地方工业生产困难出发，而是单纯从本身业务需要打圈子，因而今年一、二季度一点没有加工，直到七月份才开始组织加工，影响到济南市针织业的正常生产。
    最近该站在上级领导的指示与帮助下，对轻视扶持地方工业、不愿积极组织省内进货的问题，已作了一番检查，并订出了改正办法。但进一步的贯彻，还有待于努力。
