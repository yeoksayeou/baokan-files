    Liu Jinxing, Secretary of the CPC Qionglai Seventh District Committee, Should Not Lead Autumn Harvest with a Bureaucratic Attitude
    Chen Zhaoquan of the CPC Qionglai County Committee, Sichuan Province, writes: Liu Jinxing, Secretary of the CPC Qionglai County Seventh District Committee, summoned all township cadres in the district (leaving one person to watch over the township government) to the district for a meeting to discuss preparations for the autumn harvest at a time when farmers were busy starting the harvest. The meeting started on the evening of August 16th, beginning with each township reporting on the prevention and control of livestock and crop diseases and pests. This alone took one day and two nights of reports, ending at 12:00 midnight on the 17th. On the third day (the 18th) morning, the townships only briefly reported on the autumn harvest preparations. Many township cadres were anxious to return to lead the masses in the autumn harvest and were very dissatisfied with the way the meeting was conducted. On the evening of the 17th, Wang Zuobin, the leader of the work team sent by the county committee to Wolong Township to lead the autumn harvest, raised his opinion with Liu Jinxing, but Liu Jinxing ignored it. The "meeting" continued as usual. Finally, on the evening of the 18th, District Committee Secretary Liu Jinxing gave a summary. Everyone thought: Now he will give some working methods and solve some specific problems, right? Who knew that he simply talked about it and considered it a summary; then he arranged more than a dozen tasks that should be done at present: 1. What problems still exist in the current autumn harvest. 2. Whether the mutual aid teams understand the new situation this year and the issue of work point calculation. 3. The issue of the control of counter-revolutionaries and landlord elements… But he did not explain how to do these tasks. What made everyone especially dissatisfied was that he did not mention the key issues that should be paid attention to in the current autumn harvest: such as labor allocation, rational arrangement of work, organization of observation and learning, field ear selection, plowing while threshing, and how to prevent rice lodging, shattering, and germination. As a result, after two days and three nights of meetings, the township cadres still did not know how to do it.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    中共邛崃七区区委书记刘锦星不应以官僚主义态度领导秋收
    中共四川省邛崃县委员会陈肇权来信：中共邛崃县七区区委书记刘锦星，在农民正忙着开始秋收的时候，把全区乡干部（留一人看守乡政府）召集来区上开会，讨论准备秋收的事情。会议从八月十六日晚上开始，首先是各乡汇报防治牲畜和庄稼发生病虫害的情况，单这一项就汇报了一天两晚，到十七日晚上十二点才结束。第三天（十八日）上午各乡才简单地汇报了一下秋收准备的情形。许多乡干部都急于回去领导群众秋收，对这个会议的开法非常不满。十七日晚上，县委派到卧龙乡去领导秋收的工作组长王作彬就向刘锦星提出意见，但刘锦星置之不理。“会议”也就照样开下去。好容易挨到十八日晚上，区委书记刘锦星做总结了，大家想：这下可要交代一些工作方法和解决一些具体问题吧？谁知他简单谈了一下，便算是总结过了；接着又布置了十几项当前应该做的工作：一、目前秋收还存在那些问题。二、互助组有没有认识今年新的情况和计工算账问题。三、反革命分子和地主分子的管制问题……。但这些工作怎样作法，却没有交代。尤其使大家不满的，是对当前秋收中应注意的几个主要问题：如劳力调配、合理安排活路、组织观摩、田间穗选、边打边犁和怎样防止稻子倒伏脱粒出芽等重要问题，一点也没谈。结果是开了两天三晚的会，各乡干部还不知究竟应该怎样作。
