Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 18th: TASS, Moscow, September 18th: Kraminov published an article in "Pravda" commenting on the latest attempts by the U.S. State Department to obstruct a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. He wrote: The telegrams from Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, and Li Dongjian, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld regarding the discussion of the Korean issue at a political conference have caused unease and panic among the U.S. ruling circles. Assistant Secretary of State Murphy hastily and publicly announced that the United States rejected the proposals of the governments of People's China and People's Korea, which advocated that the political conference should be convened based on the principle of a round-table conference and that neutral countries such as the Soviet Union, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Burma should participate in the conference.

Murphy and his masters committed an obvious diplomatic error in this approach. They did not take into account an important circumstance, namely that the telegrams from Zhou Enlai and Li Dongjian were not sent to the U.S. government, but to the UN General Assembly. In the UN General Assembly, in addition to the United States, there are representatives from approximately sixty countries. Moreover, as the recent UN General Assembly meetings have shown, many member states of the UN hold views on this issue that are exactly the opposite of those held by the United States.

Kraminov asked: Why is the U.S. State Department so troubled by the telegrams from Zhou Enlai and Li Dongjian? This is because the proposals of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and the government of People's Korea, as the "Christian Science Monitor" emphasized on September 15th, risk subjecting U.S. foreign policy in the UN to a test that it has rarely had to undergo before. The newspaper also pointed out the following day that those who rule the United States see this danger in Zhou Enlai's telegram demanding that the UN act according to the wishes of the majority—allowing India and other neutral Asian countries, as well as the Soviet Union, to participate in the round-table conference.

Kraminov continued: The broad masses of peace-loving people in all countries are striving to condemn the diplomatic tricks played by the United States on the Korean issue, because these diplomatic tricks threaten peace. The proposal that the Eighth UN General Assembly should reconsider the nature and composition of the Korean political conference has received widespread support everywhere. Statements in newspapers, as well as statements by politicians and political leaders, all prove this.

According to a broadcast by Delhi Radio, Prime Minister Nehru delivered a speech in the People's Chamber on September 17th, condemning the U.S. diplomatic stance. Nehru said that Asian countries should not be ignored, should not be disregarded, and should not be suppressed.

Kraminov pointed out: Judging from the remarks of some U.S. leaders and the opinions of U.S. newspapers, the U.S. ruling circles intend to use all means of pressure and intimidation to prevent the UN General Assembly from discussing the proposals of the Government of the People's Republic of China. U.S. newspapers are jubilantly announcing that the United States—as the New York "Herald Tribune" said—has enough votes to prevent the discussion of this proposal.

According to the "New York Times," on September 16th, U.S. Representative Lodge, at a secret meeting of the delegations from the sixteen countries that participated in the war against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, proposed authorizing the United States to respond to the proposals put forward by the Government of the People's Republic of China.

Kraminov said that from this, we can see another particularly blatant diplomatic trick played by the United States to prevent the UN General Assembly from discussing the proposals of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

Kraminov concluded: The stubborn attempt by the U.S. State Department to prevent the UN General Assembly from discussing the convening of a political conference that can truly seek a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue confirms the widespread opinion that the U.S. ruling circles do not want to achieve genuine peace in the Far East is correct.

### 苏联“真理报”发表克拉米诺夫的文章  揭穿美国阻挠和平解决朝鲜问题的阴谋

    苏联“真理报”发表克拉米诺夫的文章
    揭穿美国阻挠和平解决朝鲜问题的阴谋
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十八日讯：克拉米诺夫在“真理报”上发表文章，评论美国外交当局阻挠和平解决朝鲜问题的最近的企图。他写道：中华人民共和国外交部部长周恩来与朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务省副相李东建致联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德的关于讨论朝鲜问题的政治会议的电报，已在美国统治集团中间引起了不安和惊慌。助理国务卿墨菲仓促地公开宣布美国拒绝人民中国与人民朝鲜的政府的建议，这个建议主张政治会议应该根据圆桌会议原则召开，并主张像苏联、印度、印尼、巴基斯坦与缅甸这样的中立国家应该参加这个会议。
    墨菲与他的主子的这种做法是犯了一个明显的外交错误。他们没有考虑到一个重要的情况，即周恩来与李东建的电报不是拍给美国政府的，而是拍给联合国大会的。在联合国大会里，除了美国以外，还有大约六十个国家的代表。此外，如最近的联合国大会会议所表明的，联合国的许多会员国在这个问题上所持的态度与美国所持的态度正好相反。
    克拉米诺夫问道：为什么美国外交当局对周恩来与李东建的电报会这样烦恼呢？这是因为中华人民共和国中央人民政府和人民朝鲜政府的建议，如“基督教科学箴言报”在九月十五日所着重指出的，有使美国在联合国的外交政策经受它以前很少必须经受的考验的危险。这个报纸在第二天还指出，统治美国的人们从周恩来要求联合国按照大多数的要求行事——让印度和亚洲其他中立国家以及苏联参加圆桌会议——的电报中看到了这种危险。
    克拉米诺夫接着说：各国爱好和平的广大人民竭力谴责美国在朝鲜问题上所玩弄的外交花样，因为这种外交花样威胁着和平。关于第八届联合国大会应该重新考虑朝鲜政治会议的性质和成员的问题的建议，在各处得到了广泛的支持。各报的言论以及政治家和政界领袖们的声明都证明了这一点。
    据德里电台的广播说，尼赫鲁总理于九月十七日在人民院发表演说，谴责美国的这种外交立场。尼赫鲁说，亚洲国家不应当被忽视，不应当被置之不顾，也不应当被压制。
    克拉米诺夫指出：从一些美国领袖的言论和美国报纸的舆论看来，美国统治集团打算用尽一切压力和恫吓手段来阻止联合国大会讨论中华人民共和国政府的建议。美国报纸兴高彩烈地宣布说：美国——如纽约“先驱论坛报”所说的——拥有足够的票数来阻止对这项建议的讨论。
    据“纽约时报”消息说，九月十六日，美国代表洛奇在参加反对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国战争的十六国代表团的秘密会议上提议，授权美国答复中华人民共和国政府所提出的建议。
    克拉米诺夫说，从这里，我们可以看出：美国为了阻止联合国大会讨论中华人民共和国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的建议所玩弄的另一个特别粗暴的外交手段。
    克拉米诺夫最后说：美国外交当局阻止联合国大会讨论召开一个真正能求得朝鲜问题和平解决的政治会议的顽固企图，证实了认为美国统治集团并不希望实现远东真正和平的普遍意见是正确的。
