First Aid Training for Construction Workers in Tianjin
Wei Chaima

In recent years, the number of construction workers in Tianjin has increased significantly. However, the current on-site safety equipment cannot meet the needs, the on-site health organization is not sound enough, and health personnel lack experience. In addition, some engineering departments and some technical foremen still retain the idea of ​​only using workers without paying attention to worker safety. Therefore, the incidence of worker illness and industrial accidents is still high. In order to improve the treatment of work-related injuries and on-site health conditions, the Tianjin Branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society (hereinafter referred to as the Tianjin Red Cross Branch) trained 305 workers as first-aiders on construction sites after obtaining the consent of the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Public Health Bureau, the Construction Engineering Bureau, and the seven construction companies in Tianjin. These first-aiders have played a significant role in worker safety and health care.

The first aid training work started in April this year. Initially, the leaders of the construction companies mostly did not pay much attention to this work. They believed that only by paying attention to technical safety work, adding doctors and nurses, and strengthening treatment can the problem be solved. Industrial accidents can never be handled by workers who have undergone a few days of first aid training. In response to these ideas, the Tianjin Red Cross Branch, on the one hand, introduced the experience of promoting first aid work in various Soviet factories and mines to persuade everyone; on the other hand, it strived for the support and help of the Tianjin Municipal Public Health Bureau, the Tianjin Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau, and the Tianjin Municipal Construction Trade Union. This is how the first aid training work was carried out.

The first aid training was conducted in a centralized training format. Each construction company selected workers with a cultural level of primary school or above to receive training at a ratio of 2% of the total number of workers. Personnel from the Tianjin Red Cross Branch and the Public Health Bureau were sent to give lectures. The training time was nine days, with four hours of teaching and five hours of practical exercises and discussions each day. The content of the lectures focused on first aid, with some common sense of personal hygiene and environmental hygiene. The teaching method was: teaching and learning at the same time, with more practical exercises. In the early stage of learning, due to insufficient publicity on the purpose and requirements of first aid, some students lacked confidence in learning, and some felt that it would be embarrassing to carry a first aid kit around after graduation. The enthusiasm for learning was not high. However, due to the timely education provided by the training class in response to this situation, and the positive influence of core members, everyone's understanding changed. The students generally achieved good results in the graduation test.

After the training, each construction company appropriately equipped first-aiders according to the total number of people on the construction site, and established a "General Health First Aid Station" in the company, and a "Health First Aid Station" in each construction team. The station also established first aid groups to carry out on-site first aid work. Each station also established meeting, reporting, and inspection systems to keep track of the work of the first-aiders and improve first aid work.

When the first-aiders returned to the site at the beginning, some leaders and some workers did not believe in their skills. They themselves were afraid of making mistakes, and their work was a bit timid, so the results were not very great. With the help of the Tianjin Red Cross Branch and the experience of actual work, the first-aiders' skills gradually became more proficient, and they gradually gained the trust of the workers, and the work effect became increasingly significant. In terms of saving medical expenses: according to the statistics of the Labor and Wages Section of Tanggu Construction Company: there was no construction in March, and the medical expenses for more than 900 employees were more than 25.87 million yuan. After construction started in April, the number of workers increased to 1,291. Because of the first-aiders, the medical expenses only cost more than 13.51 million yuan. Calculated by the number of people, the medical expenses in April were about two-thirds less than in March. In June, the first-aiders handled a total of 1,452 work-related injuries. If all injured workers were to go to the hospital for treatment, it is estimated that it would cost more than 2.7 million yuan in registration fees, more than 14.5 million yuan in medical expenses, plus the loss of working time due to seeing a doctor (calculated at half a workday per person on average), which would be more than 10.8 million yuan, totaling more than 28 million yuan. The depreciation of the medicines and tools used for first aid, together with the wages of the 24 first-aiders for delaying working hours, totaled only 6 to 7 million yuan, saving more than 20 million yuan invisibly. In terms of saving working hours: for example, Li Xiulin, a first-aider at the 111 construction site of the Sixth Engineering Team, handled a total of 147 work-related injuries in June. If all injured workers went to the clinic for treatment, it would take 2 hours per person each time, a total of 294 working hours, equivalent to more than 30 working days. And Li Xiulin only spent about 10 minutes per person each time to deal with these work-related injuries, totaling no more than 25 hours, with less than 3 working days lost. In terms of reducing the burden on the clinic: for example, the number of workers at the construction site of the Fourth Engineering Team of the Second Construction Company has increased by nearly one time compared to the past, but because of the first-aiders, the number of outpatients in the on-site clinic every day has decreased by half compared to the past, which has given the medical staff more time to do health prevention work.

The first-aiders are not satisfied with these achievements. In addition to actively completing first aid tasks, they also engage in prevention work. For example, Sun Changqing, a first-aider at Tanggu Construction Company, must go to the construction site to check whether the scaffolding used by workers is firm before construction every day. Sometimes he also goes to the kitchen, toilets, and other places to conduct inspections, and mobilize workers to do a good job in environmental hygiene and personal hygiene. The first aid station of the Fifth Engineering Team of the North China Directly Subordinate Second Construction Company closely cooperates with the technical safety section to conduct safety and health education to workers at any time. For example, the discarded box boards have many nails, which can easily stab workers. The first aid station and the safety section, on the one hand, reminded everyone to pay attention through broadcasting; on the other hand, they mobilized everyone to pull out the nails, which greatly reduced the work-related injuries caused by this. These all show that first-aiders also have a positive role in maintaining environmental hygiene and safety protection work.

The role played by the first-aiders has powerfully persuaded those workers who were skeptical and contemptuous of the first aid work, and their prestige among the masses is getting higher and higher. Many workers said: In the past, if they had a small injury, they would go to the clinic or the hospital, which cost a lot of money and was not worth it, and the loss of working time was too great. Now, with these "little doctors," the problem can be solved.

At present, the first-aiders in Tianjin have played a certain role; but they have not yet reached the required requirements. This is because there are still some problems in the work of the first-aiders in various construction sites that need to be studied and solved.

1. Issues regarding the leadership of the first aid organization and the technical guidance of the first-aiders. The leadership relations of the first aid stations in Tianjin construction sites can be roughly divided into three categories: one is the joint leadership of the administrative aspect of the construction company and the on-site clinic; one is the leadership of the clinic; and one is the leadership of the administrative aspect. This shows that the leadership relationship of the first aid station is not unified enough, so some problems sometimes occur in terms of drug supply and technical guidance. In fact, first aid work is a part of health work, and it is best to be led by the on-site clinic. In places where there is no clinic, it is appropriate for the administrative aspect of the construction company to lead, and the Red Cross organization is in an assisting position.

2. Issues regarding the scope of work of the first-aiders and the calculation of working hours and wages. At present, the work of many first-aiders has exceeded the scope of first aid work. For example, workers changing medicine, giving injections, and treating diseases are all matters for the clinic, but now they also look for first-aiders; the clinic often transfers them to be assistants, and the administrative aspect sometimes transfers them to write reports, which are all inappropriate. Therefore, it is necessary to explain to the leaders of the construction site and all the employees the scope of first aid work and its significance and principles of not breaking away from production. Otherwise, if the first-aiders really enter the office or the clinic and break away from on-site work, the role of the first-aiders will be lost.

Because the first-aiders do not break away from production, they will inevitably delay work when they encounter work-related accidents, which leads to the calculation of working hours and wages. Especially since the construction site has implemented the group assembly line operation method, the delay of one person will affect the work of others. If it is during the red flag competition, it will affect the group's points even more. Therefore, how should the working hours of the groups with first-aiders be calculated, and how should the working hours and wages of the first-aiders who delay work due to first aid be calculated? There needs to be a reasonable and unified way to deal with it. Otherwise, it will affect the work enthusiasm of the first-aiders and workers. Other issues, such as the ratio of first-aiders to workers, and the continued improvement of the first aid skills of the first-aiders, also need to be further studied.

    天津市建筑工人的急救训练
    卫柴马
    几年来，天津市的建筑工人增加了很多。但是目前的工地安全设备还不能满足需要，工地卫生组织不够健全，卫生人员也缺乏经验，加以某些工程部门和一些技术领工还残存着只使用工人而不注意工人安全的思想，因此工地工人的发病率和工伤事故仍多。为了改善工伤治疗和工地卫生状况，中国红十字会天津市分会（以下称天津红十字分会）在取得天津市人民政府公共卫生局、建筑工程局和在天津的七个建筑公司的同意后，在工地训练了三百零五名工人急救员。这些急救员在工人安全保健工作中起了显著的作用。
    急救训练工作是在今年四月间开始的。最初，各建筑公司的领导同志对这项工作多半不大重视。他们认为只有注意技术保安工作，增添医师、护士，加强治疗才可以解决问题；工伤事故决不是经过几天急救训练的工人能够处理的。针对这些思想情况，天津红十字分会一方面介绍苏联各厂矿推行急救工作的经验，说服大家；一方面争取天津市公共卫生局、天津市建筑工程局、天津市建筑工会的支持和帮助，这才把急救训练工作开展起来。
    急救训练是采取集中训练的方式进行的。各建筑公司在工人中按百分之二的比数抽调具有小学以上文化程度的工人受训。由天津红十字分会和公共卫生局派人授课。训练时间共九天，每天教学四小时，实习讨论五小时。讲授内容以急救为主，附带地讲授一些个人卫生和环境卫生等常识。教学方式是：边教边学，多做实际操作演习。在学习初期，由于对急救的目的和要求宣传不够，有些学员对学习缺乏信心，有些觉得结业以后，背着急救包到处跑，是很丢脸的事情，学习情绪不高。但由于训练班针对这一情况及时地进行了教育，以及骨干分子的积极影响，大家的认识改变了。结业测验时，学员成绩一般很好。
    训练结业后，各建筑公司按所属工地总人数适当地配备了急救员，并在公司内设立了“卫生急救总站”，在各工程队设立了“卫生急救站”，站下又设立了急救小组，从事现场的急救工作。各站并建立了会议、汇报、检查等制度，以便掌握急救员的工作情况，改进急救工作。
    急救员回到现场之初，有些领导同志和一部分工人不大相信他们的技术，他们自己也怕出岔子，工作有些缩手缩脚，成绩不很大。经过天津红十字分会的帮助和实际工作的锻炼，急救员的技术逐渐熟练起来，也逐渐获得了工人的信任，工作效果日益显著。在节约医药费用方面：据塘沽建筑公司劳动工薪科的统计：三月份没有开工，九百多职工共用医药费二千五百八十七万多元。四月份开工以后，工人增加到一千二百九十一人，因为有了急救员，医药费只用了一千三百五十一万多元。按人数计算下来，四月份较三月份节省了约三分之二的医药费。六月份，急救员共处理了一千四百五十二次工伤事故。受伤工人若全部去医院治疗，估计要花二百七十多万元的挂号费，一千四百五十多万元的医药费，再加上因看病误工的损失（每人平均按半工计算）约一千零八十多万元，总计约二千八百多万元。而急救所用的药品和工具折旧，连同二十四个急救员耽误工时的工资总共才六、七百万元，无形中节省了二千多万元。在节省工时方面：如第六工程队一一一工地急救员李秀林，六月份共处理工伤事故一百四十七次。如果受伤工人都到医务室治疗，每人每次以两小时计算，共需二百九十四个工时，合三十多个工作日。而李秀林在处理这些工伤时，每人每次只用十分钟左右，合计至多不过二十五个小时，误工不到三个工作日。在减轻医务室负担方面：如第二建筑公司第四工程队工地的工人，较过去增加将近一倍，但因为有了急救员，工地医务室每天的门诊数反而较前减少了一半，这就给医务人员腾出了更多的时间去做卫生预防工作。
    急救员并不满足于这些成绩。他们除了积极完成急救任务外，还从事预防工作。如塘沽建筑公司急救员孙长清，每天施工前一定要到工地检查工人操作用的手脚架是否牢固。有时还到厨房、厕所等地进行检查，动员工人作好环境卫生和个人卫生。华北直属第二建筑公司第五工程队的急救站和技术保安股密切合作，随时向工人进行安全卫生教育。如拆下的盒子板，钉子很多，容易刺伤工人。急救站和保安股一面通过广播提起大家的注意；一面发动大家拔钉子，大大减少了因此发生的工伤。这些都说明了急救员在保持环境卫生和安全保护工作中也具有积极作用。
    急救员所起的作用，有力地说服了那些对急救工作抱怀疑和轻视态度的工人，他们在群众中的威信越来越高。许多工人说：以前有了一点小伤不是去医务所，就是上医院，花钱多还不算，误工太厉害。现在，有了这些“小大夫”，可以解决问题了。
    目前天津市的急救员已经发挥了一定的作用；但是还没有达到应有的要求，这是因为各工地的急救员的工作，还有一些问题需要研究解决。
    一、关于急救组织的领导和急救员技术指导的问题。天津各工地急救站的领导关系大体可分三类：一是建筑公司行政方面和工地医务室共同领导；一是由医务室领导；一是由行政方面领导。这说明急救站的领导关系还不够统一，因此在药品供给和技术指导方面有时还发生一些问题。实际上，急救工作是卫生工作的一部分，最好由工地医务室来领导。在没有医务室的地方，以由建筑公司的行政方面领导为宜，红十字会组织则居于协助地位。
    二、急救员的工作范围和工时工资的计算问题。目前许多急救员的工作已超出了急救工作范围，例如工人换药、打针、治病等，都是医务室的事情，现在也都找急救员；医务室又常调他们去做助手，行政方面有时也调他们去写表报，这都是不恰当的。因此必须和工地的领导人以及所有的职工说明急救工作的范围以及它不脱离生产的意义和原则，不然急救员真的走进了办公室或医务室，脱离现场工作，这样就会失掉急救员的作用。
    因为急救员不脱离生产，遇到工伤事故必定耽误工作，这就发生了工时工资的计算问题。尤其是目前建筑工地实行了小组流水作业法，一人误工便会影响其他人的工作，假若在红旗竞赛期间，更会影响到小组的积分。因此，有急救员的小组，他们的工时应该怎样计算，急救员因急救误工其工时工资应当怎样计算，都需要有合理的统一的处理办法。不然会影响到急救员和工人的工作情绪。其它如急救员和工人的比数问题，急救员的急救技术继续提高的问题等，也都需要作进一步的研究。
