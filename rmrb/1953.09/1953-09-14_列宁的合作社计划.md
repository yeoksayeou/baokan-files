    Lenin's Cooperative Plan
    Wang Tongshan, Xiao Ming, Song Demin
    Lenin's cooperative plan is an important component of the overall plan for socialist construction by Lenin and Stalin.
    Russia was a backward country with a predominantly small-peasant economy. Transforming the small-peasant economy into a socialist agricultural economy was the historical task after the proletariat seized power. Without socialist agriculture, there would be no completely consolidated socialism. This historical task was quite complex and difficult. One must never use the method of expropriation used for capitalist enterprises when dealing with the individual small-peasant economy; the method of expropriating peasants is an absurd and criminal path.
    Lenin's cooperative plan correctly mapped out the path for guiding peasants to participate in socialist construction, solving the most complex and arduous historical task in socialist construction.
    Lenin's cooperative plan is based on the general theoretical principles of Marx and Engels.
    Engels wrote: "When transitioning to a communist economy, we must extensively adopt cooperative production as a transitional method. Both Marx and I are undoubtedly convinced of this. However, the core issue lies in the following: society—initially, naturally, referring to the state—must control the ownership of the means of production. Only in this way can the private interests of cooperative groups not surpass the overall interests of society." [1]
    However, due to historical limitations, Marx and Engels were unable to formulate a specific plan for transforming the small-peasant economy. This great historical task was completed by their great successor—Lenin.
    In January 1923, Lenin, while seriously ill, wrote the brilliant work "On Cooperation." In this paper, Lenin clearly pointed out the socialist nature of cooperatives under new historical conditions, under socialist conditions. He said: "Under our existing system, cooperative enterprises differ from private capitalist enterprises because cooperative enterprises are collective enterprises. However, they are no different from socialist enterprises because they are built on land belonging to the state, that is, belonging to the working class, and on means of production belonging to the state, that is, belonging to the working class."
    Lenin exceptionally emphasized the great significance of cooperatives in socialist construction. He believed that the state controls all large-scale means of production, the proletariat holds state power, the proletariat forms an alliance with millions of small and smallest peasants, the proletariat has the guarantee of leading the peasants, and so on. This is all that is necessary to successfully build complete socialism through cooperatives.
    The reason why cooperatives under socialist conditions are of such great significance lies in the fact that cooperatives are the most appropriate organizational form for carrying out the socialist transformation of individual peasants, and it best conforms to the characteristics of peasants. Individual peasants are independent laborers with a dual character. On the one hand, they are private owners of property; on the other hand, they are laborers. As laborers, they are allies of the working class, willing to follow the working class towards socialism and communism; but as private owners of property, they especially value their private interests and are habitually willing to hold on to their small businesses, making it difficult to embark on the path of collective large-scale production. Therefore, it is necessary to find an appropriate organizational form that can correctly combine the private interests of peasants with public interests. Cooperatives are precisely this most appropriate and the only organizational form that peasants can easily understand and accept.
    However, precisely because of this characteristic of peasants, the path peasants take towards socialism through cooperatives will never be achieved overnight, and they must be given sufficient time. Lenin believed that it would take a relatively long historical era to ensure that all peasants participate in cooperatives.
    The development of cooperatives from primary to advanced forms is the specific step through this historical era. The primary forms of cooperatives operating in the scope of circulation do not infringe upon the private interests and private property of small peasants in the slightest, but they bring peasants benefits in buying and selling, freeing them from the exploitation of middlemen and increasing their income. Therefore, peasants are happy to accept this form. Similarly, cooperatives in the scope of circulation also bring great benefits to the state, enabling the state to exercise a certain degree of statistics and supervision over the production of peasants through them. Advanced forms of cooperatives, collective farms, can only be extensively developed when primary forms of cooperatives have been extensively developed and have proven that cooperatives will bring irrefutable benefits to peasants. The extensive development of collective farms marks that peasants have broken away from capitalism and are moving towards socialism; because the victory of collective farms has fundamentally changed the relations of production of the individual small-peasant economy and established socialist public ownership in agriculture.
    In his cooperative plan, Lenin emphasized that the principle of voluntariness must be strictly implemented in organizing any form of cooperative. Peasants cannot be forced to participate in cooperatives, just as peasants' property cannot be forcibly expropriated. The characteristics of the individual peasant economy based on private ownership determine the conservatism of peasants' psychology. As Lenin said, peasants are the most practical people, and any reforms must rely on their personal experience. "The working class, which holds state power, can only truly prove itself correct and reasonable to the peasants, and can only absorb hundreds of millions of peasant masses to its side when it actually shows the peasants the superiority of public, collective, communal, and labor-association farming methods, and only when it helps the peasants with communal and labor-association economies. ... It is a completely absurd idea to try to transform it from the outside, from the side, by some rapid method, some order." [2]
    In addition to all of the above, state assistance to cooperatives is also very important for the full development of the cooperative movement. Lenin wrote: "In policy, cooperatives should be treated in such a way that they not only generally and regularly receive some preferential treatment, but also that this preferential treatment becomes a purely financial advantage (reducing bank interest rates, etc.). State funds should be lent to cooperatives, and this amount of funds should be more than we lend to private enterprises, or even to heavy industry, and so on." Lenin believed that this assistance is the cultivation of a new social system.
    Finally, Lenin also proposed that it is necessary to improve the cultural level of the masses so that they can understand the benefits of participating in cooperatives. Lenin believed that complete cooperation cannot be achieved unless everyone is literate and unless there is a whole cultural revolution.
    The implementation of Lenin's cooperative plan in the Soviet Union was carried out in a cruel class struggle. Comrade Stalin defended Lenin's cooperative plan in the struggle against various enemies of Leninism, and further developed it into a complete theory of agricultural collectivization. Lenin's cooperative plan is recorded in history as the Lenin-Stalin cooperative plan.
    The enemies of the working class, the betrayers of the party, the Bukharin and Trotsky elements, used all despicable methods to distort and oppose Lenin's cooperative plan. They denied the possibility of carrying out socialist transformation of the small-peasant economy. The Bukharin elements simplified Lenin's cooperative plan to merely supply and marketing cooperatives, denied the advanced form of cooperatives—collective farms, and openly demanded that the existence and development of the rich peasant economy be allowed, allowing the rich peasant economy to "peacefully" "grow into" socialism. The counter-revolutionary Trotsky elements, on the other hand, distorted Lenin's cooperative plan, covering up their reactionary essence with adventurous "leftist" rhetoric, insisting that peasants did not need to go through supply and marketing cooperatives to move towards collectivization, and advocating overturning the principle of voluntariness stipulated by Lenin, taking coercive measures to directly organize peasants into collective farms, and then using the method of turning collective farms into state-owned farms to expropriate peasants.
    It is very obvious that although their statements were different, their essence was to attempt to undermine the construction of cooperatives and collective farms, restore capitalism in the countryside, and thereby achieve their counter-revolutionary goals of undermining the worker-peasant alliance, undermining socialist construction, and overthrowing the Soviet regime.
    Comrade Stalin exposed and smashed their counter-revolutionary conspiracy. Comrade Stalin said: "It is clear that before the extensive collective farm movement has developed, the primary forms of cooperatives, namely supply cooperatives and sales cooperatives, were such 'highways'; and when the advanced form of cooperatives, namely collective farms, has appeared, collective farms have become the developing 'highway.' If we don't use parentheses, then we should say that only Lenin's collectivization plan can be regarded as the highway for socialist development in the countryside. This plan includes all agricultural cooperative forms, from primary forms (supply and sales cooperatives) to advanced forms (production and collective agricultural cooperatives). To oppose collective farms to cooperatives is to insult Leninism and expose one's ignorance." [3]
    Comrade Stalin not only defeated various counter-revolutionary theories and defended Lenin's cooperative plan, but also made great contributions to this plan. The "Biography of Stalin" points out that these contributions are: (1) comprehensively elucidating the issue of the collective farm form of the socialist economy in the countryside; (2) pointing out that the basic and main link in collective farm construction at the current stage is the agricultural labor association; (3) demonstrating the necessity of transitioning from the policy of restricting and squeezing out rich peasants to the policy of eliminating the rich peasant class on the basis of overall collectivization; (4) revealing the significance of agricultural machinery stations, pointing out that they are the strongholds for transforming agriculture according to socialist principles and for helping agriculture and peasants by the socialist state.
    Under the personal leadership of the Party and Comrade Stalin, the Soviet people victoriously implemented the Lenin-Stalin cooperative plan, established huge socialist collective agriculture in the countryside, led the basic peasant masses from the old capitalist development path to the new socialist development path, and made the lives of peasants increasingly prosperous ever since.
      The "History of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union" points out: The victory of the collective farm system is a profound revolution, a leap from the old qualitative state of society to a new qualitative state, and in terms of its results, it is of the same significance as the October Revolution. This revolution solved three fundamental problems in socialist construction in one fell swoop:
    (1) It eliminated the rich peasant class, the mainstay of capitalist restoration, which was the most numerous class of exploiters in the Soviet Union at that time.
      (2) It made the most numerous class of laborers in the Soviet Union at that time, namely the peasant class, leave the path of the individual economy that produced capitalist components and turned to the path of public collective socialist economy.
    (3) It established the socialist foundation for the Soviet regime in agriculture, the most extensive and vital, yet most backward, sector of the national economy.
    This eliminated the last source of danger of capitalist restoration in the country and created the new and decisive conditions necessary for building a socialist national economy.
    The Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government constantly consolidate collective farms organizationally and economically, making them the dominant form of socialist agriculture. The test of the Great Patriotic War proved the unparalleled strength of the collective farm system. In the post-war years, collective farms quickly healed the wounds of war and achieved further development.
    On the road to communism in the Soviet Union, Comrade Stalin planned the road to raising the ownership of collective farms to the level of ownership by the whole people, that is, the road for collective farmers to move towards communism.
    Comrade Stalin taught us: "It is necessary to raise the level of ownership of collective farms to the level of ownership by the whole people by implementing gradual transitions that are beneficial to collective farms and therefore also beneficial to the entire society, and also to replace commodity circulation with product exchange by means of gradual transitions, so that the central government or some other socio-economic center can master all products of social production for the welfare of society."
  [4]
    Now the collective farmers of the Soviet Union, under the leadership of the Party, are advancing along the road planned by Comrade Stalin towards the great, infinitely beautiful communist road.
    The Lenin-Stalin cooperative plan has great international significance. Based on the Lenin-Stalin cooperative plan and utilizing the Soviet Union's agricultural construction experience, the people's democratic countries are carrying out extensive cooperative movements. Under the leadership of the communist and workers' parties, these countries have created conditions for the rural cooperative movement. While strictly implementing the principle of voluntariness, they have extensively developed various primary forms of cooperatives and are gradually transitioning to advanced forms of agricultural labor associations. The victorious development of this movement will inevitably establish huge socialist agriculture in the people's democratic countries, thereby successfully building complete socialism.
    The Lenin-Stalin cooperative plan is of extremely great significance to the economic construction of New China, and is also the guiding light for Chinese working peasants to move towards socialism. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out long ago: "As for the peasant masses, for thousands of years they have been engaged in individual economy. Each household is a production unit. This dispersed individual production is the economic foundation of feudal rule, and it makes the peasants themselves fall into eternal poverty. The only way to overcome this situation is to gradually collectivize; and the only way to achieve collectivization, according to Lenin, is through cooperatives." [5]
    On February 15 this year, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China passed the "Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Mutual Aid and Cooperation in Agricultural Production." The resolution pointed out: "The Central Committee of the Party has always believed that in order to overcome the difficulties encountered by many peasants in decentralized management, to enable the vast number of poor peasants to rapidly increase production and embark on the road to a well-fed and well-clothed life, to enable the state to obtain much more commodity grain and other industrial raw materials than it does now, and at the same time to increase the purchasing power of peasants so that the state's industrial products can obtain a vast sales market, it is necessary to advocate 'organizing,' and to develop the enthusiasm of peasants for mutual aid and cooperation according to the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit. This mutual aid and cooperation is currently based on the individual economy (based on the private property of peasants). Its future development is agricultural collectivization or socialization." [6]
    Under the constant care and guidance of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the cooperative movement in New China has achieved extensive development. According to the statistics of 1952, more than 65 percent of the farm households in the old liberated areas participated in agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and about 25 percent of the farm households in the newly liberated areas generally participated. Nearly 4,000 agricultural production cooperatives and more than 2,600 handicraft production cooperatives were organized nationwide. By the end of 1952, there were more than 34,000 supply and marketing cooperatives nationwide, with more than 141.1 million members.
    In New China, there are roughly three main forms of mutual aid and cooperation in agricultural production: simple labor mutual aid, year-round mutual aid teams, and agricultural production cooperatives (or land cooperatives) characterized by land shares. Our policy is to actively lead the mutual aid and cooperation movement according to the needs and possibilities of production development, adhere to the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit, gradually transition from low-level forms to high-level forms, and move forward steadily.
    In the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement, there are two erroneous tendencies: one is to adopt an impatient attitude; the other is to adopt a passive attitude. The resolution of the Party Central Committee criticized these two erroneous tendencies, pointing out that coercion and command that violate the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit are wrong, and letting things take their own course is also wrong.
    The facts over a long period of time have proven that the policy formulated by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong in accordance with the Lenin-Stalin cooperative plan is completely correct. This policy is actually educating the vast number of peasants and guiding them towards the road of socialism.

    列宁的合作社计划
    王同善　肖明　宋德敏
    列宁的合作社计划，是列宁、斯大林建设社会主义总计划中的重要组成部分。
    俄国是一个小农经济占优势的落后国家。把小农经济改造为社会主义农业经济，是无产阶级取得政权后的历史任务。没有社会主义农业，就没有完全巩固的社会主义。这一历史任务是相当复杂和困难的。对待个体小农经济绝不能用对待资本家企业的那种剥夺办法；剥夺农民的办法，是荒谬和犯罪的道路。
    列宁的合作社计划，正确地规划了引导农民参加社会主义建设的道路。解决了社会主义建设中最复杂最艰巨的历史任务。
    列宁的合作社计划，是以马克思和恩格斯的一般理论原则为基础的。
    恩格斯写道：“当着过渡到共产主义经济的时候，我们必须大量采用合作社的生产作为过渡的办法，关于这一点，我和马克思两人都是确信无疑的。不过问题的中心却在于下面一点，就是要使社会——最初自然是指国家而言——掌握生产工具的所有权，这样才能使合作社团体的私有利益不能超过于社会整个利益之上。”〔一〕
    然而，由于历史条件的限制，马克思和恩格斯两人并没有能够作出关于改造小农经济的具体计划。这一伟大的历史任务，是由他们事业的伟大继承人——列宁完成了。
    一九二三年一月，列宁在重病中写了“论合作制”这一天才著作。列宁在这篇论文中，明确地指出了在新的历史条件下，在社会主义条件下，合作社的社会主义性质。他说：“在我们的现存制度下，合作企业与私人资本主义企业不同，因为合作企业是集体企业，但它与社会主义企业没有区别，因为它是建筑在属于国家，即属于工人阶级的土地上，是建筑在属于国家，即属于工人阶级的生产资料上。”
    列宁异常强调合作社在社会主义建设中的重大意义。他认为：国家支配着一切大生产资料，无产阶级执掌着国家政权，无产阶级与千百万小农及最小农结成联盟，无产阶级有对农民实行领导的保证等等，这就是经过合作社来把完备的社会主义建设成功所必需的一切。
    社会主义条件下的合作社之所以具有如此重大的意义，就在于合作社乃是对个体农民进行社会主义改造的最恰当的组织形式，它最符合于农民的特点。个体农民是具有两重性格的独立劳动者，一方面他是财产的私有者，另一方面他又是劳动者。作为劳动者，他是工人阶级的同盟军，他愿意随同工人阶级走向社会主义和共产主义；而作为财产私有者，他又特别看重自己的私人利益，习惯上愿意抓住自己的一份小产业，不大容易走上集体的大生产的道路。因此，必须找到一种能够正确地将农民的私人利益与公共利益结合起来的恰当的组织形式。合作社正是这种最恰当的也是农民最容易了解和接受的唯一的组织形式。
    然而，也正由于农民的这种特点，农民通过合作社这条道路走向社会主义，决不是一蹴而就的，还必须给他们以充分的时间。列宁认为，要做到使全体农民都参加合作社，就需要一个较长的历史时代。
    合作社由初级形式到高级形式的发展，就是通过这一历史时代的具体步骤。活动于流通范围中的初级形式的合作社，并不丝毫触犯小农的私有利益和私有财产，但它给农民带来了在买卖中的利益，使他们免除了中间商人的剥削，增加了收入，因而农民乐于接受这种形式。同样，流通范围的合作社，也给国家带来了莫大的利益，使国家可以通过它对农民的生产加以某种程度的统计和监督。合作社的高级形式集体农庄，只有在初级形式合作社大量发展，并证明了合作社会给农民带来无可争辩的利益的时候，才能大量发展起来。集体农庄的大量发展，标志着农民已脱离了资本主义而走向社会主义；因为集体农庄的胜利，已根本改变了个体小农经济的生产关系，在农业中建立了社会主义的公有制。
    列宁在他的合作社计划中，强调指出无论组织那一种形式的合作社，都必须严格地贯彻自愿原则。不能强迫农民参加合作社，正如不能强制剥夺农民的财产一样。建立在私有制基础上的个体农民经济的特点，决定了农民心理上的保守性。正如列宁所说，农民是最实际的人，要使他们作任何改革，都必须靠他们的亲身体验。“掌握国家政权的工人阶级，只有当它在事实上向农民表明了公共的，集体的，共耕制的，劳动组合制的耕种方法底优越时，只有当它用共耕制的，劳动组合制的经济来帮助了农民时，它才能真正向农民证明自己正确有理，才能把数千百万农民群众吸收到自己方面来。……要想用某种急速办法，某种命令来从外面，从旁边去强迫加以改造，那都是完全荒谬的思想。”〔二〕
    除上述一切之外，要使合作社运动获得充分发展，国家对合作社的帮助也是十分重要的。列宁写道：“在政策上要这样对待合作社，使它不仅一般地和经常地获得某种优待，并且使这种优待成为纯粹资财上的优待（减低银行息金等等）。要用国家资金贷予合作社，这种资金额应比我们借给私人企业的，甚至比借给重工业等等的还要多一些。”列宁认为，这种帮助是对新的社会制度的培植。
    最后，列宁还提出了：必须提高人民群众的文化程度，使他们能懂得参加合作社的利益。列宁认为，如果不做到人人都识字，如果没有整个的文化革命，那么，完全合作化便是不可能实现的。
    在苏联实现列宁的合作社计划，是在残酷的阶级斗争中进行的。斯大林同志在和列宁主义的各种敌人进行斗争中捍卫了列宁的合作社计划，并进一步发展为完整的农业集体化理论。列宁的合作社计划，做为列宁—斯大林的合作社计划而载入史册。
    工人阶级的敌人，党的叛逆，布哈林和托洛茨基分子，用尽一切卑鄙的办法，歪曲和反对列宁的合作社计划。他们否认对小农经济实行社会主义改造的可能性。布哈林分子把列宁的合作社计划简化为仅仅限于供销合作社，否认合作社的高级形式——集体农庄，并公然要求允许富农经济的存在与发展，让富农经济“和平地”“长入”社会主义。反革命的托洛茨基分子则从另一方面歪曲列宁的合作社计划，以冒险的“左”的词句掩盖其反动本质，硬说农民走向集体化不需要经过供销合作社，并且主张推翻列宁所规定的自愿原则，采取强迫命令的办法把农民直接组织在集体农庄中，然后再用变集体农庄为国营农场的办法来剥夺农民。
    十分明显，尽管他们两者的说法不同，但其本质都是企图破坏合作社和集体农庄建设，使资本主义在农村中复辟，从而达到他们破坏工农联盟，破坏社会主义建设以及推翻苏维埃政权的反革命目的。
    斯大林同志揭露并粉碎了他们的反革命阴谋。斯大林同志说：“很明显的，在广大的集体农庄运动还没有发展的时候，合作社的初级形式，即供给合作社和销售合作社，本是这样的‘大路’；而当合作社的高级形式，即集体农庄已经出现的时候，集体农庄就成为发展‘大路’了。如果不用括弧来讲，那就要说，只有列宁底合作化计划，才算是农村中的社会主义发展大路，这个计划包括所有一切农业合作形式，由初级形式（供给的，销售的合作社）起一直到高级形式（生产的，集体农业的合作社）止。把集体农庄与合作社对立起来，就是侮辱列宁主义，而暴露自己愚昧无知。”〔三〕
    斯大林同志不仅击败了各种反革命理论，捍卫了列宁的合作社计划，并且对这一计划给予了伟大的贡献。“斯大林传略”指出这些贡献就是：（一）从各方面阐明了农村中社会主义经济的集体农庄形式问题；（二）指出了现阶段上集体农庄建设的基本和主要环节是农业劳动组合；（三）论证了从限制和排挤富农的政策过渡到在全盘集体化基础上消灭富农阶级的政策的必要；（四）揭示了农业机器站的意义，指出它是按社会主义原则改造农业并由社会主义国家帮助农业和农民的据点。
    苏联人民在党和斯大林同志亲自领导下，胜利地实现了列宁—斯大林的合作社计划，在农村中建立了社会主义的巨大的集体农业，把基本农民群众由旧的资本主义的发展道路引上了新的社会主义的发展道路，使农民生活从此日益富裕。
      “联共（布）党史”指出：集体农庄制度的胜利，是一个极深刻的革命，是从社会的旧质态转变到新质态的飞跃，按其结果来说，它是与十月革命具有同等意义的。这个革命一举而解决了社会主义建设中的三个根本问题：
    （一）它把当时苏联人数最多的剥削者阶级，资本主义复辟的支柱，即富农阶级消灭了。
      （二）它使当时苏联人数最多的劳动者阶级，即农民阶级，离开了产生资本主义成份的个体经济的道路而转上了公共集体社会主义经济的道路。
    （三）它在农业这一最广大和切身必需，而又最落后的国民经济部门中，给苏维埃政权建立了社会主义的基础。
    这样就把国内所有的资本主义复辟危险的最后根源消灭了，而创造了建成社会主义国民经济所必需的新的有决定意义的条件。
    苏联共产党和苏维埃政府不断的在组织上和经济上巩固集体农庄，使其成为社会主义农业的统治形式。伟大卫国战争年代的考验，证明了集体农庄制度的无比强固。战后年代的集体农庄很快医治了战争创伤，并获得了进一步的发展。
    斯大林同志在苏联走向共产主义的道路上，又规划了把集体农庄所有制提高到全民所有制水平的道路，即集体农民走向共产主义的道路。
    斯大林同志教导我们说：“必须用实行起来有利于集体农庄因而也有利于整个社会的逐渐过渡的办法，来把集体农庄所有制提高到全民所有制的水平，并且也用逐渐过渡的办法使产品交换制来代替商品流通，使中央政权或其他某个社会经济中心能够为了社会福利来掌握社会生产的全部产品。”
  〔四〕
    现在苏联的集体农民，正在党的领导下，按照斯大林同志所规划的道路，向着伟大的无限美好的共产主义道路前进。
    列宁斯大林的合作社计划，具有伟大的国际意义。依据列宁斯大林合作社计划并利用苏联农业建设经验的各人民民主国家，正在开展着广泛的合作社运动，这些国家在共产党和工人党的领导之下，给农村的合作社运动创设了条件。他们在严格执行自愿的原则下，大量地发展了各种初级形式的合作社，并逐渐地过渡到高级形式的农业劳动组合。这一运动的胜利展开，必然在各人民民主国家中建立起巨大的社会主义农业，从而把完备的社会主义建设成功。
    列宁斯大林的合作社计划，对于新中国的经济建设同样具有极其巨大的意义，同样是中国劳动农民走向社会主义的指路明灯。毛泽东同志早就指出：“在农民群众方面，几千年来都是个体经济，一家一户就是一个生产单位，这种分散的个体生产，就是封建统治的经济基础，而使农民自己陷于永远的穷苦。克服这种状况的唯一办法，就是逐渐地集体化；而达到集体化的唯一道路，依据列宁所说，就是经过合作社。”〔五〕
    今年二月十五日中共中央通过了“中国共产党中央委员会关于农业生产互助合作的决议”，决议中指出：“党中央从来认为要克服很多农民在分散经营中所发生的困难，要使广大贫困的农民能够迅速地增加生产而走上丰衣足食的道路，要使国家得到比现在多得多的商品粮食及其他工业原料，同时也就提高农民的购买力，使国家的工业品得到广大的销场，就必须提倡‘组织起来’，按照自愿和互利的原则，发展农民互助合作的积极性，这种互助合作在现在是建立在个体经济基础上（农民私有财产的基础上）的集体劳动，其发展前途就是农业集体化或社会主义化。”〔六〕
    新中国的合作社运动，在党中央和毛主席的不断关怀和指导下，获得了广泛的发展。据一九五二年的统计，老解放区的农户参加农业生产互助合作组织的占总农户的百分之六十五以上、新解放区一般地占总农户的百分之二十五左右。全国组织了近四千个农业生产合作社，组织了二千六百多个手工业生产合作社。到一九五二年年底，全国已有三万四千多个供销合作社，拥有一亿四千一百余万社员。
    在新中国，农业生产上的互助合作运动大体上有三种主要的形式：简单的劳动互助，常年的互助组和以土地入股为特点的农业生产合作社（或土地合作社）。我们的方针，就是根据生产的发展需要与可能，积极领导互助合作运动，坚持自愿与互利的原则，逐步从低级形式过渡到高级形式，稳步前进。
    在农业互助合作运动中，有两种错误的倾向：一种是采取急躁态度；另一种是采用消极态度。党中央的决议批判了这两种错误的倾向，指出违反自愿和互利原则的强迫命令是错误的，放任自流也是错误的。
    长期以来的事实，证明党中央和毛泽东同志依据列宁斯大林合作社计划所制定的方针是完全正确的，这个方针在实际上教育着广大的农民，引导他们走向社会主义的道路。
