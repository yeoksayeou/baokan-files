Xinhua News Agency, Gui Sui, September 26th: Mongolian herdsmen in Zhaowuda League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, have exceeded this year's patriotic livestock increase plan. In Zhaowuda League this year, the breeding rate of cattle, horses, sheep and other livestock averaged over 90%, and the survival rate of young livestock reached 94%. Among them, the ewes in Ar Horqin Banner even gave birth to many twins, bringing the lamb breeding rate as high as 122%. Now, the total net increase of various livestock in the league's pastoral areas is 130,000 head, exceeding the original plan by 27%.

The bumper harvest of various livestock in Zhaowuda League this year is inseparable from the widespread implementation of labor mutual aid among the league's herdsmen. Herdsmen in Balin Left Banner, Balin Right Banner, Ar Horqin Banner, and Keshiketeng Banner, in order to overcome the difficulty of insufficient labor, organized more than 1,400 mutual aid groups for lambing, disaster prevention, grass cutting, and wolf hunting this year. These seasonal mutual aid groups have strongly strengthened livestock protection work. The mutual aid group led by Hua La, a Mongolian woman from Keshiketeng Banner, delivered a total of 279 young livestock without a single loss. The 558 lambing mutual aid groups organized by more than 5,400 male and female herdsmen in Ar Horqin Banner also prepared a large number of woolen sheep bags, wicker baskets, and yurts for lambing, enabling lambs and calves to grow safely.

    内蒙古昭乌达盟牧民超额完成增畜计划
    【新华社归绥二十六日电】内蒙古自治区昭乌达盟的蒙族牧民，已超额完成今年爱国增畜计划。昭乌达盟今年牛、马、羊等牲畜，繁殖率平均达百分之九十以上，幼畜成活率达到百分之九十四。其中阿鲁科尔沁旗的母羊还生了许多双羔，使羊羔繁殖率高达百分之一百二十二。现在，全盟牧区纯增的各种牲畜共十三万头，超过原计划的百分之二十七。
    昭乌达盟今年各种牲畜能够丰产，是和该盟牧民普遍实行劳动互助分不开的。巴林左翼旗、巴林右翼旗、阿鲁科尔沁旗和克什克腾旗的牧民们，为克服劳动力不足的困难，今年共组织了一千四百多个接羔、防灾、打草、打狼互助组。这些季节性的互助组，有力地加强了保畜工作。克什克腾旗蒙族妇女花拉带头组织的互助组，共接了二百七十九头幼畜，没有一只受到损失。阿鲁科尔沁旗五千四百多名男女牧民组织的五百五十八个接羔互助组，还置备了大批接羔用的毛织羊包、柳条筐和蒙古包，使羊羔、牛犊能够安全成长。
