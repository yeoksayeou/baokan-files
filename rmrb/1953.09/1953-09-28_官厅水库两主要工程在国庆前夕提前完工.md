Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 27th—The two major projects of the Yongding River Guanting Reservoir, the dam and the spillway, were completed ahead of schedule according to design standards before the National Day. Even if a major flood occurs once in a thousand years in the future, it will be tamed and controlled by the reservoir and will no longer cause harm. The threat of upstream floods of the Yongding River to the capital, Tianjin, and the tens of millions of people in the lower reaches of the Yongding River has been permanently eliminated.

The dam and spillway are two of the three major projects of the Guanting Reservoir. The dam project requires filling 1,010,000 cubic meters of materials; the spillway requires excavating more than 155,000 cubic meters of rock, pouring more than 12,000 cubic meters of concrete, and binding more than 110 tons of rebar. Among them, the concrete pouring project of the 85-meter-long reverse arc steep slope at the spillway outlet is the most technically complex project. However, these were all completed ahead of schedule according to design standards. The safety factor of the dam is 1.4. Both of these projects were originally scheduled to be completed by the end of September, but the dam was completed six days ahead of schedule, and the spillway was completed five days ahead of schedule.

One year and ten months ago, the entrance to the Guanting Gorge was still a large gap of 360 meters wide. In front of this gap was the low-lying Huailai Basin. For many years, the floods of the Yongding River's upstream rivers converged in this basin, and then poured into the Hebei Plain through the large gap of the Guanting Gorge, causing harm. In 1939, one flood inundated 2,000 square kilometers of land. Rulers of past dynasties had no solution to it. But today, a 290-meter-long dam, as high as a fifteen-story building (45 meters) and covered with granite, stretches across the gap in the Guanting Gorge, controlling the Yongding River. The flood is contained in the Huailai Basin, only flowing through the 490-meter-long, 8-meter-diameter tunnel next to the dam; when the flood threatens the dam, the spillway is opened to discharge the flood. Now that all the projects have been completed ahead of schedule, the water intake tower project in front of the water diversion tunnel next to the dam is being rushed day and night. After this project is completed, the tunnel flood flow can be completely controlled in a planned manner, creating a beautiful 230-square-kilometer artificial lake here.

At present, the fourth phase of the water intake tower project has also been completed seven days ahead of the original plan. Some of the employees who built the dam and spillway have rushed to the water intake tower construction site, which is under intense construction, and started the final phase of the water intake tower project. The Guanting Reservoir is selecting labor models, summarizing work, and preparing for a grand celebration. Celebrate National Day and also celebrate the completion of the dam and spillway projects.

### 官厅水库两主要工程在国庆前夕提前完工

    官厅水库两主要工程在国庆前夕提前完工
    【新华社保定二十七日电】永定河官厅水库的拦河坝和溢洪道两主要工程，在国庆前夕按照设计标准提前完工。今后即使发生千年一遇的大洪水，它也会驯服地接受水库的控制不再为害。永定河上游洪水千百年来对首都、天津和永定河下游千万人民的威胁永远解除了。
    拦河坝和溢洪道是官厅水库三大主要工程中的两项巨大工程。拦河坝工程要填筑一百零一万公方的物料；溢洪道要开凿岩石十五万五千多公方，浇筑混凝土一万二千余公方，绑扎钢筋一百一十余吨。其中溢洪道出口处八十五公尺长反弧陡坡的混凝土浇筑工程又是技术性最高的复杂工程。但是，这些都按设计标准提前完成了。拦河坝安全系数达一点四。这两项工程原均计划九月底完成，结果是拦河坝提前六天完成，溢洪道提前五天完成。
    在一年零十个月前，官厅山峡入口处，还是一个三百六十公尺宽的大缺口。这缺口前面是低洼的怀来盆地。多少年来，永定河上游各河洪水便在这盆地汇合，然后经过官厅山峡那个大缺口倾泄入河北平原为害。一九三九年一次淹没土地两千平方公里。历代统治者对它没一点办法。但是今天一座二百九十公尺长，十五层楼那样高（四十五公尺）披着花岗石外衣的拦河大坝，横遮在官厅山峡那个缺口处，把永定河管住了。洪水被圈在怀来盆地，只钻进拦河坝旁四百九十余公尺长、直径八公尺的隧洞下流；洪水危及拦河坝时，开放溢洪道宣泄洪水。现在所有工程均已提前结束，正日夜赶建拦河坝旁输水隧洞前面的进水塔工程，等这项工程完成后，便能完全有计划地控制隧洞洪水流量，把这里造成二百三十平方公里大的美丽的人造湖。
    目前，进水塔第四期工程也较原计划提前七天完工，修建拦河坝和溢洪道的部分员工，已赶到正在紧张施工的进水塔工地，开始了进水塔最后一期工程。官厅水库正在评选劳动模范，总结工作和筹备盛大的庆祝会。庆祝国庆也庆祝拦河坝溢洪道工程的完工。
