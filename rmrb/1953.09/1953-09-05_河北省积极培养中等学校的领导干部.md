In order to strengthen the leadership of secondary schools and eliminate the phenomenon of many schools lacking leading cadres, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Hebei Provincial People's Government recently transferred 207 cadres at the county and district levels and held the Hebei Provincial Secondary Education Cadre Study Conference in Baoding.

Many of the cadres transferred by Hebei Province this time are Communist Party members who have been tested by years of revolutionary struggle. After a short period of professional study, they can all take on leadership roles in schools. After the completion of their studies, it is planned to assign more than 110 people to various middle schools to serve as principals, vice-principals, or directors of teaching, directors of general affairs, and political instructors. The rest will be assigned appropriate work according to their abilities.

Hebei Province's method of transferring county and district-level cadres for short-term study and then assigning them to various secondary schools to serve as leading backbone personnel has basically solved the problem of the lack of leading cadres or the weakness of leading cadres in many secondary schools throughout the province.

    河北省积极培养中等学校的领导干部
    为加强中等学校的领导，消除许多学校缺乏领导干部的现象，中共河北省委和河北省人民政府在最近抽调了县区级干部二百零七人，在保定举办了河北省中等教育干部学习会议。
    河北省此次抽调的干部，很多是经过多年革命斗争考验的共产党员。经过短期的业务学习后，他们都能担任学校的领导工作。学习结束以后，准备把一百一十余人分配到各中学担任正副校长或教导主任、总务主任和政治教员等工作。其余则按照他们的能力分别分配以适当的工作。
    河北省采用这种抽调县区级干部进行短期学习，然后把他们分配到各中等学校担任领导骨干的办法，基本上解决了全省许多中等学校缺乏领导干部或领导干部弱的问题。
