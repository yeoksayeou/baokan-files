Xinhua News Agency, London, September 20th: According to TASS, British Labour leader Clement Attlee delivered a radio address on September 19th. Referring to Churchill's speech in the House of Commons on May 11th, he said, "It is regrettable that Churchill's initiative did not receive a response."

    Speaking of the situation in the Far East, Attlee pointed out that the United States "resolutely opposed" India's participation in the political conference on the Korean issue, thereby depriving this Asian power of its right to attend.

    Attlee said, "I think the American tendency to suspect everyone who does not fully support American views is very dangerous. I feel that the reflection of this situation in American foreign policy is a certain paranoid tendency that many people are troubled by."

    Attlee added, "Furthermore, the US opposition to the People's Government of China occupying the seat in the Security Council that rightfully belongs to China has become increasingly strong. The remnants of Chiang Kai-shek still occupy this seat, which is an obstacle to peace." Attlee emphasized, "The de facto government of China should occupy its seat in the United Nations."

    He also said, "Syngman Rhee's warmongering speeches calling for the conquest of North Korea have caused great concern. A unified Korea is certainly needed, but it cannot be achieved by force." Commenting on the Sixteen-Nation Declaration, which the British government also signed, Attlee said, "Constantly repeating threatening words is not a reasonable way to handle diplomatic affairs."

    Speaking of his hope to cooperate with "American friends," Attlee pointed out, "However, this cannot prevent us from expressing our own opinions. If we believe that our friends are pursuing an unwise policy, our friendship with the United States requires us to point this out."

    英国工党领袖艾德礼不满美国的外交政策
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社伦敦二十日讯：英国工党领袖艾德礼九月十九日发表广播演说。他提到邱吉尔五月十一日在下院发表的演说时说：“值得惋惜的是，邱吉尔的倡议并没有获得响应。”
    艾德礼讲到远东的情况时指出，美国“坚决反对”印度参加关于朝鲜问题的政治会议，从而剥夺了这个亚洲大国的出席权。
    艾德礼说：“我认为美国对所有不完全支持美国见解的人加以怀疑的倾向是十分危险的。我觉得，这种情形在美国外交政策方面的反映就是许多人为之烦恼的那种某些偏执倾向。”
    艾德礼又说：“此外，美国反对中国人民政府占有理应属于中国的安理会的席位的态度变得越来越强硬了。蒋介石残余仍旧盘据这个席位，这就是和平的障碍。”艾德礼着重说：“事实上的中国政府，应当在联合国占有着自己的席位。”
    他还说：“李承晚号召征服北朝鲜的好战的演说引起很大的忧虑。一个统一的朝鲜当然是需要的，但不能用武力来实行统一。”艾德礼评论到英国政府也签了字的十六国宣言时说：“老是重复着威胁的话，并不是处理外交事务的合理的方法。”
    艾德礼讲到希望和“美国的朋友们”合作时指出：“但是，这不能使我们不发表自己的意见。如果我们认为我们的朋友奉行的是不明智的方针，我们和美国之间的友谊就要求我们指出这一点。”
