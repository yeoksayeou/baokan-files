Chairman Malenkov's Speech at a Banquet Held in the Kremlin

Respected Prime Minister, esteemed members of the Government Delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea!

Allow me here, in Moscow, to congratulate you and, through you, to congratulate the heroic Korean people who have defended their homeland from the aggressors. The men and women of the Soviet Union, together with all progressive humanity, hold deep friendship for the Korean people.

Today, the word "Korean" has become a symbol of great national resilience, a symbol of lofty and selfless service for the freedom and independence of the motherland.

The glorious Korean people have written a new and brilliant page in the history of their liberation struggle. This page teaches us that there is no force in the world that can destroy a nation that has taken its destiny into its own hands.

The invincible will, the courageous spirit, and the heroism of the Korean patriots in their struggle have two sources: the recognition of the profound justice of their cause and the unprecedented solidarity of all progressive humanity with the Korean people.

The immortal feats of the Chinese People's Volunteers prove that the unity between the peoples of Asian countries is unbreakable. This is the sign of a new era beginning in the East, the sign of the determination of the Asian peoples to strive for and safeguard national freedom and independence, and not to allow Asia to become a hotbed for a new world war.

Peace-loving peoples of all countries gratefully acknowledge the historically significant contributions of the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers, because they have defended peace in the Far East, thus greatly cooling down the frenzy of the aggressors who sought to launch a new world war. The heroic struggle of the glorious Korean patriots and Chinese patriots on the Korean battlefield has dealt a very effective blow to the reactionary forces' long-term plan to suppress the progressive movements of the Asian and Pacific countries that are embarking on the path of national freedom and independence.

The aggressive bloc is unwilling to admit such an indisputable fact: the old Asia, where people suffered barbaric oppression and enslavement by foreign forces, is gone forever. They still want to stop and hinder the great resurgence of the peoples of the East, a trend that has become one of the most important characteristics of our time, opening up encouraging prospects for the further development of the entire modern civilization.

In our time, can we still find an American who would consider the decision made by the thirteen colonies in North America 175 years ago to end their colonial dependence and establish the United States of America as an act of historical progress? In our time, can we still find an American who would consider the Declaration of Independence illegal because it declares the right of the people to establish a government based on the principles and forms "most conducive to ensuring their safety and happiness" as obvious truths? Of course not. Then why do the powerful figures in the United States rudely interfere in the internal affairs of the Eastern countries, impose blockades on them, and provoke wars simply because the people of these countries have chosen forms of government that do not conform to the wishes of Washington's political leaders?

Obviously, there is a rather peculiar philosophy involved, which claims that what Americans did in the late eighteenth century cannot be done by the Chinese, Indians, Koreans, or Indonesians, even in the last fifty years of the twentieth century. However, this is just the old tune of racism; it is an attempt to pursue a policy that challenges the historically significant progress of all nations. If some American leaders still pretend to be enemies of the "old colonial policy," then it must be admitted that their new colonial policy has surpassed all expansionist policies known to date: it is aggressive, and its purpose is to re-divide the world for the benefit of the United States of America.

Now it should be understood that history does not develop according to the orders of those who want it to stand still, who want to hinder the progress of the people, and who want to impose the yesterday of mankind as its tomorrow. Only those who do not understand the world situation turn their policies towards Eastern countries into a policy of solely supporting those individuals and groups that represent the most backward and decadent forces. Only those who intentionally want to artificially complicate the situation in the East allow themselves to despise the great Chinese people and bet on anti-people scum like the Chiang Kai-shek clique.

This kind of policy is a shortsighted policy. People cannot ignore the fundamental changes that have taken place in Asia and the Pacific region, changes that have also left their mark on the post-war lives of more than one billion people in this region.

Needless to say, the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement is the most important milestone in the struggle of all peace-loving forces against the forces of aggression and international adventurism. It vividly proves that as long as all peace-loving forces are persevering, sharp international problems can be resolved properly.

However, it is unforgivable to ignore the new conspiracies of the aggressive forces in the East. It is quite obvious that the purpose of all these conspiracies is to undermine the Korean armistice and create a tense situation in the Asian and Pacific region.

Everyone knows that the US Secretary of State recently signed a treaty with Syngman Rhee, stipulating that the United States has the right to "station land, sea, and air forces in or near the territory of the Republic of Korea" for an "indefinite period." In other words, if the American armed forces stationed in South Korea until now were there for the purpose of war, then in the future they will remain there under the so-called mutual defense treaty. The essence of the matter remains unchanged, and the intention is to continue to use South Korea as a bridgehead for the United States, which is of course incompatible with the requirements for a final peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and strengthening security in Asia.

It should also be added that the position of the US government officials on the composition and agenda of the political conference to be convened in accordance with the Korean Armistice Agreement has aroused legitimate condemnation from peace-loving forces. This position excludes India and other Eastern countries from the conference, while these countries should undoubtedly participate in the political conference.

All this by no means indicates that the powerful figures in the United States have a desire to consolidate the Korean armistice that has already been achieved and take another step towards a final peaceful settlement of the Korean issue.

Thus, all peace-loving forces bear a greater responsibility. They can and must take the Korean armistice as a starting point and make further efforts to further ease international tensions around the world, including in the East.

Objective conditions enable the progressive social forces in the East to turn Asia into a fortress of peace, and people should warmly wish all Asian people success in completing this noble task.

One of the most important of these objective conditions is the international prestige of the People's Republic of China and its policies. The decades-long struggle of various imperialist blocs to dominate China has created particularly tense international relations in the East. Now, the People's Republic of China appears as a strong and stable factor in Asia and the Pacific region. The masters of aggression are enraged because China will never again be their object of plunder and exploitation, because China has not only formally but also actually achieved sovereignty, because China does not appear on the international stage as a minor character who looks to others for guidance, but is pursuing its own independent and autonomous policies. Another great power has emerged in the world, and this great power, together with all peace-loving forces, is jointly striving to consolidate peace and international security. This is indeed one of the most important historical results in the international situation of recent decades, a result that not only illuminates the path that has already been traveled, but also illuminates the path ahead.

However, some people are pursuing a policy of aggression against China, attempting to isolate the People's Republic of China. Obviously, in the current international environment, any attempt to "isolate" the People's Republic of China is merely a reactionary dream of those who are out of touch with life and have lost their sense of reality.

Now is the time to abandon the policy that violates common sense and the requirements of historical development, stubbornly believing that the major issues concerning the establishment of peace among nations can be resolved without the great China.

The unbreakable friendship between the peace-loving Soviet Union and the peace-loving People's Republic of China is a strong fortress of peace. It is precisely for this reason that this friendship is supported by the people of all countries, who regard it as one of the most important conditions for consolidating international peace.

Countries in the Asian and Pacific region are developing in conditions of peace and consolidation of security in the East, and they are very likely to develop peaceful economic relations among themselves and with other regions of the world, thereby creating the necessary conditions to solve the problem of providing constructive and effective assistance to Asian countries by many countries in a new way.

Dear friends! Please allow me, through you, to express to the heroic Korean people the heartfelt friendship of all the men and women of the Soviet Union. The friendship between our two peoples is built on mutual respect for the sovereignty and independence of our two countries, and on the determination of both sides to fight for the consolidation of peace and international security. This means that this friendship can be further consolidated and developed.

The people of all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union are pleased that the great Chinese people have also forged an unbreakable friendship with the Korean people. The heroic sons and daughters of the Chinese people shed their blood on the land of Korea for the victory of truth, for the freedom and independence of the Korean people, and used their blood to consolidate this friendship. May the glorious friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples last forever.

The Democratic People's Republic of Korea embodies the sincere hope of the Korean people to restore national unity and to strive for peace and progress.

There is no doubt that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will certainly achieve great achievements in the near future in restoring and further developing its economy and culture, as well as in improving the welfare of its people.

The Soviet Union will do everything possible to help the Democratic People's Republic of Korea heal the wounds inflicted upon it by the aggressors.

In the arduous struggle against the aggressors, the masses of the people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea demonstrated their greatest unity to the world, a unity based on the historically significant achievement of the Korean working people - the alliance between the working class and the peasants. It is hoped that our Korean brothers will cherish this sacred alliance as the apple of their eye in the future, and tirelessly consolidate this alliance by all means.

I am convinced that this rising country - as everyone calls Korea - will soon achieve complete peace and embark on the road of comprehensive upswing.

I would now like to propose a toast to the strong friendship between the Soviet and Korean peoples, to the heroic Korean people, to the complete and peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and the restoration of the national unity of the Korean people, to the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and to your health, Comrade Prime Minister.

### 在克里姆林宫举行的宴会上  马林科夫主席的谈话

专栏：

    在克里姆林宫举行的宴会上
    马林科夫主席的谈话敬爱的首相，敬爱的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表团团员们！
    让我在这里，在莫斯科，祝贺你们，并通过你们祝贺保卫了自己祖国的土地不受干涉者侵害的英雄的朝鲜人民。苏联的男女和全体进步人类一起对朝鲜人民怀着深厚的友情。
    今天，朝鲜人这个字眼已成为了伟大的刚毅的民族精神的象征，成为了为祖国的自由与独立而从事崇高的忘我的服务的象征。
    光荣的朝鲜人民在解放斗争史上写下了新的灿烂的一页。这一页教导我们：世界上没有一种力量可以摧毁一个已经把国家的命运掌握在自己手里的民族。
    朝鲜的爱国者在斗争中的必胜的意志、勇敢的精神和英雄气概有两个源泉：认识到自己的事业的深刻的正义性和全体进步人类与朝鲜人民空前的团结一致。
    中国人民志愿军的不朽的功绩证明亚洲各国人民之间的团结是牢不可破的。这是在东方开始的新纪元的标志，这是亚洲人民争取并维护民族自由和独立、不让亚洲成为新世界大战的温床的决心的标志。
    爱好和平的各国人民怀着感激的心情承认朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军的具有历史意义的功绩，因为他们保卫住了远东的和平，因而使力图发动新世界大战的侵略者的狂热大大冷却下来。光荣的朝鲜爱国者和中国爱国者在朝鲜战场上的英雄斗争，对反动势力的以镇压正在走上民族自由和独立的大道的亚洲及太平洋各国人民的进步运动为目的的长远计划是一个非常有效的打击。
    侵略集团不愿意承认这样一个无可争辩的事实，就是：人民遭受外国势力的野蛮压迫和奴役的古老的亚洲已经一去不复返了。他们还想制止和阻挠东方各国人民的这一伟大的复兴的潮流，这一潮流已成为我们这个时代的最重要的特征之一，它为整个现代文明的进一步发展开辟令人鼓舞的前景。
    在我们这个时代是否还找得到这样一个美国人，他会认为北美洲十三个殖民地在一百七十五年前采取的结束它们的殖民地附属地位、建立美利坚合众国的决定不是一个历史进步的行动呢？在我们这个时代是否还找得到这样一个美国人，他会认为独立宣言是非法的，因为它把人民根据“对于保证他们的安全和幸福最为有利的”原则和形式建立政府的权利宣布为明显的真理？当然，不会有这种人。那末为什么由于东方国家的人民选择了不合华盛顿政治领袖的意思的政府形式，美国的当权人物就要粗暴地干涉这些国家的内政，对他们实行封锁和挑起战争呢？
    显然，其中有着相当特别的哲学，据说，美国人在十八世纪末叶所做的事，中国人、印度人、朝鲜人、印尼人甚至在二十世纪后五十年还不能做。可是，这不过是种族主义者的老调；这是企图奉行一种向各国人民的具有历史意义的进步挑战的政策。如果若干美国领袖们还装作是“旧殖民政策”的敌人，那就必须承认，他们的新殖民政策已经超过了迄今所知的一切扩张政策：它带有侵略性，它的目的是为了美利坚合众国的利益重新划分世界。
    现在应该了解到，历史不是根据那些希望它静止不动、想阻挠人民的进步、把人类的昨天当作它的明天来强加给人类的人们的命令发展的。只有那些不认识世界局势的人们才把他们对东方国家的政策变成单单支持那些代表了最落后、最腐朽的力量的个人和集团的政策。只有那些有意要人为地使东方形势复杂化的人们，才容许他们自己轻视伟大的中国人民，并把赌注押在像蒋介石集团这样的反人民的渣滓上。
    这一类的政策是短视的政策。人们不能忽视在亚洲和太平洋区域已经发生了根本的变化，这一变化并且在这一地区的十亿以上人口的战后生活中烙了印记。
    不用说，朝鲜停战协定的签订是一切和平力量反对侵略势力和国际冒险势力的斗争中的最重要的里程碑。它生动地证明了，只要一切爱好和平的力量能坚忍不拔，尖锐的国际问题是可以获得应有的解决的。
    可是，忽视了侵略势力在东方的新的阴谋，那是不可原谅的。十分明显，这一切阴谋的目的是破坏朝鲜停战，在亚洲和太平洋区域造成紧张的局势。
    大家知道，不久以前美国国务卿与李承晚签订了一个条约，规定美国在“无限期”中有权“在大韩民国的领土上或是它的附近地区驻扎陆、海、空军部队”。换句话说，如果到现在为止驻留在南朝鲜境内的美国武装部队是为了战争的目的，那末今后它将根据所谓共同防御条约而驻留下去。这件事的本质仍旧没有改变，其打算就是使南朝鲜继续作为美国的桥头堡，这当然是与最后和平解决朝鲜问题和加强亚洲的安全的要求不相容的。
    还应该附带说一句：美国政府人士在根据朝鲜停战协定而召开的政治会议的组成和议程问题上的立场引起了爱好和平的力量的正当的谴责。这种立场使得印度及其他一些东方国家被摈斥于会议以外，而这些国家应参加政治会议是不容置疑的。
    这一切都绝不能说明美国当权人物有巩固业已达成的朝鲜停战和向最后和平解决朝鲜问题再跨进
  一步的愿望。
    这样，一切爱好和平的力量就负有更大的责任。他们可以而且必须以朝鲜的停战为出发点，再作努力，使全世界（包括东方在内）的国际紧张局势进一步缓和。
    客观条件使东方的进步社会力量可以把亚洲变成和平堡垒，人们应当热烈祝全体亚洲人民在完成这一崇高任务方面获得成就。
    在这些客观条件中最重要的一个条件是中华人民共和国的国际威望和它的政策。各个帝国主义集团数十年来争取霸占中国的斗争，在东方造成了特别紧张的国际关系。现在中华人民共和国以强大的稳定因素出现于亚洲和太平洋区域。专事侵略的大师们动了肝火，因为中国永远不再是他们鱼肉和剥削的对象了，因为中国不只是形式上、而且是实际上取得了主权，因为中国不是以看别人颜色的小角色出现在国际舞台上，而是执行着自己的独立自主的政策。世界上出现了又一个大国，这个大国跟一切爱好和平的力量在一起，共同为巩固和平与国际安全而努力。这确实是近数十年来国际局势中的一个最重要的历史结果，这个结果不仅照亮了已经走过了的道路，而且也照亮了未来的前程。
    然而有些人士竟对中国实行侵略政策，企图孤立中华人民共和国。显然，在当前国际环境下，任何想使中华人民共和国“孤立”的打算只不过是那些脱离生活、丧失现实感的人们的反动梦想而已。
    现在是时候了，应当放弃那种违反常识和历史发展要求、固执地认为在目前可以没有伟大的中国而解决有关建立各国之间和平的重大问题的政策了。
    爱好和平的苏联和爱好和平的中华人民共和国的牢不可破的友谊是强大的和平堡垒。正是为了这个缘故，这种友谊得到各国人民的拥护，他们认为这是巩固国际和平的头等重要的条件之一。
    亚洲和太平洋区域各国正在和平与巩固东方安全的条件下发展着，它们非常有可能在它们之间以及与世界上其他地区发展和平的经济关系，从而创造必要的条件，按新的方式解决许多国家给亚洲国家以建设性的有效的援助的问题。
    亲爱的朋友们！请允许我通过你们向英雄的朝鲜人民表达全体苏联男女对他们的衷心的友情。我们两国人民的友谊建筑在互相尊重我们两国的主权和独立的基础上，建筑在双方决心为巩固和平与国际安全而奋斗的基础上。这就是说，这种友谊完全可以得到进一步的巩固和发展。
    苏联各族人民高兴的是，伟大的中国人民也和朝鲜人民结成牢不可破的友谊。中国人民的英雄儿女为了真理的胜利、为了朝鲜人民的自由和独立在朝鲜的土地上洒下了他们的鲜血，用自己的鲜血来巩固这种友谊。愿中朝两国人民的光辉友谊万古长存。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国体现着渴望恢复国家统一、渴望和平与进步的朝鲜人民的衷心希望。
    毫无疑问，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国在短期内就一定可以在恢复和进一步发展本国经济及文化中与在提高人民的福利方面，获得巨大的成就。
    苏联将尽一切力量帮助朝鲜民主主义人民共和国医治干涉者带给它的创伤。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的人民大众在对干涉者进行艰苦的搏斗中，向全世界表现了他们的最伟大的团结一致，这种团结一致的基础是朝鲜劳动人民的具有历史意义的成果——工人阶级和农民的联盟。希望我们的朝鲜弟兄们今后像爱护眼珠一样爱护这个神圣的联盟，并不倦地用一切办法巩固这种联盟。
    我深信，这个旭日初升的国家——如大家称呼朝鲜的那样——能够很快地获得完全的和平，走上全面高涨的道路。
    我现在要为苏朝两国人民的牢固友谊、为英雄的朝鲜人民，为朝鲜问题的彻底和平解决和朝鲜人民的国家统一的恢复、为朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和为您——首相同志——的健康而干杯。
