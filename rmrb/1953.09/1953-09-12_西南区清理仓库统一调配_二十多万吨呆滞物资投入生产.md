    Southwest Region Clears Warehouses, Unified Allocation: Over 200,000 Tons of Stagnant Materials Put into Production
    Over 230,000 tons of cleared materials in the Southwest Region, after unified allocation and vigorous processing, more than 90% have been put into production, playing a due role in economic construction and national defense construction. This batch of national property had been scattered and stockpiled in warehouses or piled up in the open air, exposed to sun and rain, by the Kuomintang reactionaries for many years. After the People's Government took over, it repeatedly mobilized the broad masses of workers and staff, and adopted various effective methods to clean them up, so that they could be used for production and construction.
    The materials management department classified the cleared warehouse materials batch by batch and allocated them to the relevant material-using departments. At the same time, it also organized technical employees from factories and mines to visit the warehouses in person and choose materials for utilization. National Treasury Materials Exhibition was held in Chongqing and Guiyang. In Chongqing alone, more than 400 units of employees attended the exhibition to visit and purchase. For some materials, special personnel were organized to carry samples and inventory lists to actively solicit transfer from material-using units. Chongqing State-owned No. 101 Factory cleaned up a pile of "waste steel" (originally parts of horsepower machines) that had been placed in the open-air mud for more than ten years. After processing and renovation with the help of Soviet experts, it was installed as the largest horsepower machine in the Southwest Region, which greatly improved the factory's ability to roll steel rails. More than 80% of the existing machines in a machinery factory in Guiyang are utilizing old machines from cleared materials. After more than 1,000 tons of oil pipes from cleared materials in Yunnan Province were transferred to the Northwest Petroleum Company, the company used them to establish oil depots and opened up dozens of kilometers of oil transportation stations. Rubber boats from cleared materials in Guizhou Province were transferred to the troops entering Tibet, which solved the special transportation difficulties in the march into Tibet. When the Southwest Pharmaceutical Company was short of supplies and had to purchase a large number of pharmaceutical products from other regions, it found that there were a large number of high-quality medicines in the cleared materials, so it stopped purchasing from outside and supplied the cleared medicines to the market.
    In order to continue to vigorously handle the cleared materials, the Southwest Branch of the National Materials Reserve Bureau recently cleared and concentrated the materials in its directly affiliated warehouses from more than a dozen warehouses to three warehouses according to the classification of processing. It also established a dedicated person-in-charge warehouse management system, and carried out "four checks" (check name, check quantity, check specification, check composition). Based on the results of the "four checks", a set of material ledgers were established to provide information for the continued processing of the cleared materials. All cleared materials will be processed by the end of this year. For some materials that cannot be processed for the time being, strengthen the management and protection work. Some machines have been oiled to prevent rust or sheds have been built to cover them. (Ding Hong)

    西南区清理仓库统一调配
    二十多万吨呆滞物资投入生产
    西南区二十三万多吨清仓物资，经过统一调配和大力处理后，已经有百分之九十以上投入生产，在经济建设和国防建设上发挥了应有的作用。这一批祖国财产，过去若干年一直被国民党反动派分散积压在仓库里，或堆放在露天里，日晒雨淋。人民政府接管以后，多次发动广大职工群众，采取各种有效办法进行清理，使其用到生产建设上。
    物资管理部门将清理后的仓库物资，一批一批的分类拨给有关用料部门。同时还组织厂、矿、企业的技术员工，到仓库里去实地参观，选择利用。在重庆市和贵阳市举办了国库物资展览会。仅重庆市就有四百多个单位的职工到会参观选购。有些物资还组织了专人携带样品和清册，主动送到用料单位去征求调拨。重庆国营一零一厂将一堆在露天烂泥里摆了十多年的“废钢铁”（原为马力机的机件）清理出来，经苏联专家帮助加工整修后，安装成为西南区最大的一部马力机，大大提高了该厂轧钢轨的能力。贵阳某机械厂现有机器百分之八十以上是利用清仓物资中的废旧机器。云南省有清仓物资油管千余吨调给西北石油公司以后，使该公司用来建立了石油库，开辟了几十公里长的石油运输站。贵州省清仓物资中的橡皮船调给进藏部队，解决了进军西藏中的特殊交通困难。西南医药公司货源缺乏，要到外区大量采购医药用品时，发现清仓物资中存有大量品质良好的药品，便停止了对外购买，而将清仓药品供应了市场需要。
    国家物资储备局西南分局最近为了继续大力处理清仓物资，将直属仓库物资按照处理的分类，从十多个库房清理集中到三个库房。并建立了专人专库保管制度，进行了“四查”（查名称、查数量、查规格、查成分），根据“四查”结果，再建立一套材料账簿，以为继续处理清仓物资的资料。全部清仓物资将争取在今年底以前处理完毕。对于某些一时无法处理的物资，加强保管和保护工作。有部分机器已擦油防锈或搭棚遮盖。（丁弘）
