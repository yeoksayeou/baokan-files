Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 4th. To intensify the rescue of the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" who are scheduled to receive their final verdict on November 5th, the Japanese National Relief Association convened a central committee meeting on August 23rd, deciding to launch a nationwide rescue movement for the victims of the "Matsukawa Incident" for the months of September and October.

The activities of the "Matsukawa Incident" Victims Rescue Month include: holding lectures, forums, "Matsukawa Incident" victims rescue evening parties, and screenings of "Matsukawa Incident" newsreel films, as well as launching a signature campaign demanding the release of all twenty patriots of the "Matsukawa Incident" and raising rescue funds and other extensive activities.

The victims of the "Matsukawa Incident" are receiving increasing support from people from all walks of life in Japan. Workers' organizations, such as the Central Struggle Committee of the Japan National Railway Workers' Union, have successively dispatched慰问团 (consolation groups) and investigation teams to Sendai to encourage and comfort the patriotic fighters of the "Matsukawa Incident" who have been persisting in court and prison struggles for a long time. Famous writers such as Naoya Shiga, Kazuo Hirotsu, and Koji Uno have also risen up and taken up their pens to join the movement to rescue the victims of the "Matsukawa Incident," and have personally gone to prisons to offer encouragement. At the same time, many international workers' organizations affiliated with the World Federation of Trade Unions are constantly supporting and encouraging the heroic struggle of the victims of the "Matsukawa Incident" and have successively lodged protests with the Yoshida government. The Central Council of Bulgarian Trade Unions and the Central Committee of the Albanian Transport Workers' Union have recently sent telegrams to Yoshida, protesting the continued persecution of the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident."

All defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" issued a joint statement on July 23, expressing their gratitude to the Japanese people and the people of the world for rescuing and encouraging their struggle. The statement appealed to people from all walks of life: In order to protect human rights, freedom, and democracy, and in order to defend truth, peace, and the independence of our homeland Japan, we earnestly hope that the rescue movement will be carried through to the end.

    日本国民救援会举行中央委员会会议
    决定发起救援“松川事件”被害者的运动
    【新华社四日讯】东京消息：为了加紧拯救即将于十一月五日最后宣判的“松川事件”无辜被告，日本国民救援会于八月二十三日召开了中央委员会，决定以九、十两个月为“松川事件”被害者救援月，展开全国规模的救援运动。
    “松川事件”被害者救援月的活动包括：举行讲演会、座谈会、“松川事件”被害者救援晚会和“松川事件”新闻记录影片放映会，并展开要求释放“松川事件”全体二十位爱国者的签名运动和募集救援基金等广泛的运动。
    “松川事件”被害者正受到越来越多的日本各界人民的支持。日本国营铁道工会中央斗争委员会等工人团体，曾陆续派遣慰问团和调查团前往仙台，鼓舞和慰问长期坚持着法庭和监狱斗争的“松川事件”爱国志士。志贺直哉、广津和郎、宇野浩二等著名作家，也都奋起执笔投入救援“松川事件”被害者的运动中，并亲往监狱进行慰勉。同时，世界工会联合会所属的许多国际工人组织，也在不断声援和鼓励“松川事件”被害者的英勇斗争，并纷纷向吉田政府提出抗议。保加利亚总工会中央理事会和阿尔巴尼亚交通工人工会中央委员会最近都分别致电吉田，抗议继续迫害“松川事件”的无辜被告。
    “松川事件”全体被告曾于七月二十三日发表共同声明，向救援和鼓舞他们斗争的日本人民及全世界人民表示感谢。声明向各界人民呼吁：为了保障人权、自由和民主主义，为了保卫真理、和平与祖国日本的独立，切望把救援运动进行到底。
