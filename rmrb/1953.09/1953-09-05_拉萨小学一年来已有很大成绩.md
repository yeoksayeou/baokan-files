Lhasa Elementary School, since its opening on August 15th of last year, has achieved great success in all aspects by earnestly implementing the educational policy of "developing Tibetan language and writing and enhancing the patriotic ideology of Tibetan children" over the past year.

Over the past year, Lhasa Elementary School, with the close unity of Tibetan and Han teachers, has created many new teaching methods and improved teaching efficiency. In Tibetan language teaching, the teaching efficiency was rapidly improved by changing the old teaching methods, omitting the specialized phonics stage, shortening calligraphy practice time, and adding explanations of word meanings, sentence making, corrections, and composition. Currently, students who had a slight degree of Tibetan calligraphy proficiency when they first entered school can generally make sentences, some students can take lecture notes, and children who are generally new to Tibetan have also learned "Tsurin" (Tibetan uppercase) and are practicing sentence making. In the past, because there was no arithmetic method using Arabic numerals, students generally had no arithmetic foundation. The teachers used object-based teaching methods to increase students' interest in learning, and then proceeded according to general methods. In one year, half of the school's students have learned mixed four operations, and the advanced group has begun to learn fractions and decimals. The learning achievements in music, art, and physical education courses are even better. Children have learned more than 40 new songs. Under the leadership of the school's entertainment committee, they have written short plays depicting the happy life of the school, and rehearsed many entertainment programs using Tibetan tap dance, folk songs, etc. Some students can play various musical instruments such as organ, harmonica, and flute, and have begun to learn simple music theory.

Among all the subjects, students have a very strong interest in common knowledge classes. The school introduced the brief history of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the great achievements of the motherland's economic and cultural construction to the students in conjunction with festivals such as "July 1st" and "August 1st." Senior students also studied the Common Program, the ethnic policy, and the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet, which enabled all students to further recognize the greatness and loveliness of the motherland. When elementary school students read Tibetan picture books in the Linka (park), they would raise their small hands and shout "Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao!" as soon as they saw a picture of Chairman Mao.

From the first semester, the school adopted democratic methods to manage students. It has initially cultivated new virtues of mutual assistance, honesty, cleanliness, love for public property, and a new atmosphere of hard study among children. This year, the whole school selected twelve model students on Children's Day.

These achievements have been praised by people from all walks of life in Tibet. Over the past year, the school has held two student academic exhibitions, inviting parents to visit their children's learning achievements. Parents expressed great satisfaction with the students' progress over the past year. Now, many farmers from places one or two hundred miles away from Lhasa are also sending their children to school.

    拉萨小学一年来已有很大成绩
    拉萨市小学校自去年八月十五日开学后，一年来，切实执行“发展西藏民族语言文字，提高藏族儿童爱国思想”的教育方针，在各方面都有了很大成绩。
    一年来，拉萨小学在藏族、汉族老师的亲密团结下，创造了许多新的教学方法，提高了教学效率。在藏文教学方面，由于改变了旧的教学方法，省略了专门拼音的阶段，缩短练习书法的时间，加上讲解字意、造句、改错、作文等内容，使藏文学习成绩迅速提高。目前，初入学时稍有藏文书法程度的学生，已普遍能够造句，部分学生已能作讲演记录，一般初学藏文的儿童也学会了“粗仁”（藏文大楷），正在练习造句。过去由于没有阿拉伯数字的算法，学生大都没有算术基础，教员们即以实物教学的方法，提高学生的学习兴趣，然后再按一般方法进行。一年中，全校有半数学生已学会了混合四则，高级组已开始学习分数和小数。在音乐、美术、体育等课程方面，学习成绩更为优良，儿童们已学会了四十多支新歌，在学校文娱活动委员会的领导下，他们编写了描写学校幸福生活的短剧，用本民族的踢踏舞、民歌等排练了许多文娱节目。有些学生已能演奏风琴、口琴、笛等各种乐器，并开始学习简单的乐理。
    在各门功课中，学生们对常识课的兴趣非常浓厚。学校配合“七一”、“八一”等节日给学生们介绍了中国共产党、中国人民解放军的简史和祖国经济、文化建设的伟大成就等。高年级的学生们还学习了共同纲领民族政策和关于和平解放西藏办法的协议，使全校学生进一步认识到祖国的伟大可爱。小学生们在林卡里阅读藏文画报时，一看到毛主席像就举起小手，放开喉咙高呼“毛主席！毛主席！”
    从第一学期开始，学校就采用民主方式管理学生。初步培养了儿童们的互助、诚实、爱清洁、爱护公共财物的新道德和努力学习的新风气。今年儿童节全校就评选了十二个模范学生。
    这些成绩得到西藏各阶层人士的好评。一年来，学校举行了两次学生学业展览会，邀请家长参观孩子们的学习成绩。家长们对学生一年来的进步表示非常满意。现在，许多远距拉萨一、二百里地方的农民也把自己的孩子送到学校来读书。
