    Ministry of Railways Passenger Transport Department Notifies Local Railway Bureaus to Avoid Transporting Chickens and Ducks in Baggage and Postal Cars

    The Ministry of Railways Passenger Transport Department wrote: The July 27th "Reader's Letters Summary" column published a letter of suggestion from the Shanghai Post Office Transportation Department Committee of the China Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union regarding "Chickens and Ducks Should Not Be Transported on Baggage and Postal Cars." After our inquiry, the Shanghai Railway Administration invited representatives from the Shanghai Post Office Transportation Department, escort representatives, and relevant units under the administration to study this issue. It was decided that baggage and postal cars will implement fixed marshalling in the future and will be frequently flushed to facilitate loading mail; when the postal compartment of the baggage and postal car is not fully loaded with mail, the railway can use it to load baggage and ordinary parcels, but chickens, ducks, and poultry must not be transported; the Shanghai Post Office should strengthen planned transportation to avoid sporadic use of space in baggage and postal cars, so as to avoid wasting transportation capacity.

    In order to make all railway bureaus nationwide aware of this issue, our department has notified the railway administrations that they should avoid using baggage and postal vehicles to transport chickens and ducks as much as possible in the future, so as not to affect the health and work of postal escort comrades.

    铁道部客运处通知各地路局行李邮政车应避免装运鸡鸭
    中央人民政府铁道部客运处来信：七月二十七日“读者来信摘要”栏刊载了中国邮电工会上海邮局运输处委员会关于“行李邮政车上不应装运鸡鸭”的建议信。经我们查询，上海铁路管理局已邀请上海邮局运输处代表、押运员代表和该局所属有关单位对这个问题进行了研究，决定今后行李邮政车实行固定编组，并经常冲洗，以利装载邮件；在行李邮政车邮政间装载邮件不足时，铁路方面可利用装载行李及普通包裹，但不得装运鸡鸭家禽；上海邮局则应加强计划运输，尽量避免零星使用行李邮政车的容间，以免浪费运输力量。
    为了使全国路局都注意这个问题，我处已通知铁路管理局，今后应尽量避免使用行李邮政车辆装运鸡鸭，以免影响邮局押运同志的健康和工作。
