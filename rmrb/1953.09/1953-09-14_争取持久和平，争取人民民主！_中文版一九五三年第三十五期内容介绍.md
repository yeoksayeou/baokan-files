    "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Chinese Edition, 1953, Issue 35 Contents Introduction
    The Chinese edition of the Communist and Workers' Parties Information Bureau's newspaper "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Issue 35, 1953, has been published.
    The central content of this issue is the talks held in Moscow in late August between the Soviet government and the delegation of the German Democratic Republic government. This issue publishes an editorial entitled "The Historical Task of the German People." The editorial points out that Germany is at the most critical stage in its history. The historical task of the German people is to thwart the conspiracies of the aggressive forces, restore the unity of their country, and make Germany a peace-loving and democratic country.
    Under the title "Further Develop the National Economy and Further Improve the People's Welfare!" this issue publishes an excerpt of the speech delivered by Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, on August 22nd in Bucharest, celebrating the ninth anniversary of the liberation of Romania by the Soviet Army. Based on the analysis and decisions of the August meeting of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party regarding the domestic situation, this speech pointed out the shortcomings in Romania's past economic construction due to the failure to fully comply with the requirements of proportional development of the various sectors of the national economy, and proposed the main measures to correct these shortcomings.
    This issue also publishes an article by Mauro Scoccimarro, Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, entitled "The Political Situation in Italy." The article points out that due to the victory of the democratic forces in Italy, primarily the Communist Party, in the June parliamentary elections, the Gasperi government collapsed, and a government headed by Pella was reluctantly formed, whose policy is essentially still the policy of the past Christian Democratic Party government, and whose main goal is still to maintain the party's monopoly of power. Under these circumstances, the Italian people must remain highly vigilant. The main task of the Italian Communist Party at present is to maintain and expand the unity and cooperation of all people's forces, and to fight in parliament and throughout the country to achieve the Communist Party's program of striving for peace, freedom, and work.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版
    一九五三年第三十五期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五三年第三十五期中文版已经出版。
    本期的中心内容是苏联政府和德意志民主共和国政府代表团八月下旬在莫斯科举行的会谈。本期以“德国人民的历史任务”为题发表社论。社论指出，德国正处在它的历史上最紧要的阶段。德国人民的历史任务就是挫败侵略势力的阴谋，恢复自己国家的统一，使德国成为一个爱好和平的民主国家。
    本期在“进一步发展国民经济，进一步提高人民的福利！”的标题下，摘要刊载了罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会总书记格·乔治乌—德治八月二十二日在布加勒斯特庆祝苏军解放罗马尼亚九周年纪念会上发表的演说。这篇演说根据罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会八月会议对国内形势的分析和决定，指出了罗马尼亚过去的经济建设中由于没有完全符合国民经济各部门按比例发展的要求而产生的缺点，并且提出了改正这些缺点的主要措施。
    本期还刊载了意大利共产党书记莫罗·斯科奇马罗的“意大利的政治形势”一文。文章指出，由于意大利民主力量首先是共产党在六月间的议会选举中获得的胜利，加斯贝利政府垮台了，勉强组成了以贝拉为首的政府，它的政策实质上仍是过去天主教民主党政府的政策，主要的目标也还是保持该党的独占政权。在这种形势下，意大利人民必须保持高度的警惕。意大利共产党当前的主要任务就是，保持和扩大一切人民力量的团结和合作，在议会里和全国各地进行斗争，争取实现共产党的争取和平、自由和工作的纲领。（新华社）
