The "Quick Annealing Chart" that Guarantees the Workshop Exceeds Its Monthly Plan

Since the New Shanghai Steel Plant's Machine Shop implemented the work plan in the first quarter, the output of castings in the sand casting section has doubled, but the production of the annealing section has not increased accordingly. At that time, Chief Engineer Xu Dexin, in order to overcome the disconnect between sand casting and annealing, after repeated research, finally helped the annealing section to compile a "Quick Annealing Chart," which uses the "quick firing" method to shorten the annealing time of each kiln.

However, when Chief Engineer Xu took this chart to the annealing team for explanation, the workers disagreed as soon as they heard the words "quick firing." At that time, some people said, "Annealing malleable iron, annealing malleable iron, the quality of malleable iron depends on the length of the annealing time. If it's 'quick firing,' the product quality will definitely be affected." The workshop director did not seriously study and actively support Chief Engineer Xu's method, so this method was shelved.

The workers in the annealing team were also using their brains and thinking of ways. They made full use of the area of the annealing car and modified the annealing box, which increased the kiln loading by 30% to 40%. Production team leader Sun Xuelun proposed a rationalization suggestion to add an annealing car for exchange, so that the products could be hot-in and hot-out, shortening the empty kiln time.

However, the backlog of castings was still very serious. Under such circumstances, factory director Feng Yi resolutely supported Chief Engineer Xu's suggestion and personally mobilized the workers of the annealing team, saying, "Let's all try a kiln according to Chief Engineer Xu's method." During the trial, production team leader Sun Xuelun was still a little worried, but after the first kiln was fired, although the product was a little hard, the annealing time was shortened by one-fifth. The workers then had confidence and seriously studied and improved the temperature increase method, overcoming the shortcomings of Chief Engineer Xu's method.

After the implementation of this advanced annealing method, from April to now, the number of annealing kilns has not increased, and the output of sand casting has not decreased, but the output of annealing products has increased by an average of one to one and a half times, and the scrap rate has also been reduced to 1%, so that the production of sand casting and annealing in the malleable iron shop is no longer disconnected, and the state plan is overfulfilled every month.

Refining Pig Iron from Waste Materials Saves More Than 400 Million Yuan

For more than four years, various workshops of the state-owned Tianjin Central Electrical Equipment Manufacturing West Factory have accumulated a lot of broken silicon steel sheets and iron powder, totaling about 400 tons. In the past, everyone thought this was waste material, so they used it to fill pits, pave roads, or use it as furnace ash residue, and the rest was piled up in the yard. In April of last year, foundry worker Liu Yuxiang saw this large pile of things piled in the yard, exposed to wind and rain, and wasted in vain, which he felt was a pity. He proposed to the leadership to re-melt these broken silicon steel sheets and iron powder into pig iron, but his suggestion was not valued by the leadership.

In April of this year, after the struggle against bureaucracy, Liu Yuxiang put forward this suggestion again, which was supported by the leadership this time. After some preparation, on April 17, he used the factory's original cold blast furnace to do the smelting test. The pig iron smelted was tested, and the iron output reached more than 85%, and the quality was very good. At the same time, three 30 kVA transformer oil tanks were trial-cast with the pig iron he refined. Because the iron structure was relatively tight, there was no oil seepage.

Although the experiment was successful, the cold blast furnace had to be used by the foundry team every day, and it was impossible to supply him with long-term pig iron smelting. Liu Yuxiang suggested to the leadership to repair a broken cold blast furnace in the yard for pig iron smelting, so the problem of the furnace was solved.

The temperature for smelting silicon steel sheets and iron powder is very high. The furnace often has to be heated to more than 1,800 degrees Celsius. The furnace wall is corroded very quickly, and the furnace wall has to be repaired once after smelting two or three tons of iron, which prolongs the smelting time. Liu Yuxiang collected the mica powder (which was no longer useful) left over from the factory, mixed it with the material for making refractory bricks to paste the furnace wall, and solved the problem of the furnace wall being easily damaged. Now one repair can melt seven or eight tons of iron. Up to now, the factory has smelted about 170 tons of pig iron (about 200 tons of broken silicon steel sheets and iron powder have not yet been smelted). According to preliminary statistics, calculated at 3 million yuan per ton (excluding 300,000 yuan in cost), Liu Yuxiang's suggestion has saved the country about 450 million yuan of wealth.

The Difficulty of Spring Hoop is Solved

Since the end of July this year, the Qingdao Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant has started the production task of new locomotives and passenger cars in the second half of the year. When manufacturing new locomotive and passenger car parts, the forging workshop first encountered a difficulty: the spring hoops made were not up to standard, and more than 80% of the products were defective every day. However, a lot of spring hoops were needed. One passenger car requires 32, and each coal water car of the locomotive also requires 24. Therefore, after working for several days, the assembly workshop could not deliver the work as planned, and the workshop leaders and workers were very anxious.

At this time, technician Li Yuanjin went to the workshop to study with the workers how to improve the quality of spring hoops. He first found Du Jinping, Dong Wenxu and other workers who made spring hoops to understand their operating conditions, and specifically taught them how to control the temperature of the iron, to what extent the raw materials of the spring hoop should be heated in the furnace, and how many should be burned each time. After such continuous research and step-by-step improvement, the product quality was indeed improved. After research with the workers, Li Yuanjin also created eight special tools for manufacturing spring hoops, which increased the production efficiency of spring hoops by more than two times at once. In the past, a steam hammer work group could only forge about 20 spring hoops a day with great effort. Now they can complete 64 a day, and the quality has also been greatly improved. The scrap rate has dropped from 80% to less than 7%. Li Yuanjin and the workers also signed a contract to ensure that the quality of the spring hoops reaches more than 98%. After the beginning of August, the steam hammer work group for forging spring hoops can complete the task according to the planned progress every day, and deliver batches of qualified spring hoops to the assembly workshop.

Saving "Half a Foreign Yuan"

The Gao Mingshan group of the First Machine Workshop of the State-owned Shanghai Second Textile Machinery Factory uses the most materials in the entire workshop. The number of foreign yuan of various sizes alone requires three to four thousand per month. When the production task came down, the supply and marketing section blanked the materials. According to the old rules, each foreign yuan shaft head was extended by half a cent, and both ends were extended by one cent, as the car dirt loss when the plane was car. For three years, the production section issued material preparation lists like this, and the supply and marketing section set material consumption quotas like this. They clearly knew that there was waste here, but no one considered it. Some people said: "As long as the task is completed, what does it matter if more materials are used!" Therefore, no one cared about small things like half a foreign yuan.

Gao Mingshan is the foreman of the eighth group of the First Machine Workshop. Their group recently discussed savings targets, and female worker Jia Hongmei proposed to save the "car dirt" of half a foreign yuan. Jia Hongmei has always been responsible for leveling the two ends of the car foreign yuan. She believes that it costs a lot of materials and labor to remove one cent of "car dirt" from each foreign yuan. If the "car dirt" is changed to half a cent, the plane can be smoothly car. Gao Mingshan immediately transferred this opinion to the comrade in the supply and marketing section responsible for blanking. The supply and marketing section accepted this suggestion and implemented it from September. After calculating the details, each foreign yuan saves half a cent, and 57,000 foreign yuan per year can save 2,850 inches; the labor, electricity, and car knife consumption saved will be worth more than 12 million yuan.

The trade union seized on the example of saving half a foreign yuan to carry out publicity, educating everyone to pay attention not only to the completion of the product value task but also to saving costs when discussing production indicators, even if it is a little bit of saving, the accumulation can play a great role.

    创造性的劳动
    保证车间月月超额完成计划的“快速焖火表”
    上海新沪钢铁厂马铁车间自从第一季度实行作业计划后，翻砂工段铸件的产量提高了两倍，而焖火工段的生产没有随着提高。当时，徐德新总工程师为了克服翻砂和焖火脱节现象，经过反复研究，终于帮助焖火工段编制出一张“快速焖火表”，就是用“快烧”的方法来缩短每一窑的焖火时间。
    但是，徐总工程师拿这张表到焖火组去讲解，工人们一听“快烧”两个字就不同意。当时有人就说：“焖马铁、焖马铁，马铁全靠焖的时间长，要是‘快烧’，产品质量一定受影响。”车间主任也没有认真研究和积极支持徐总工程师的办法，因此这个办法就被搁置起来了。
    焖火组工人也在动脑筋、想办法，他们充分利用焖火车的面积改装了焖火箱，使窑装量增加了百分之三十到四十。生产组长孙学伦提出合理化建议，增加一部焖火车，可以调换，使产品能热出热进，缩短了空窑时间。
    但是铸件积压现象还是十分严重。在这样的情况下，厂长冯毅同志坚决支持徐总工程师的建议，亲自动员焖火组工人说：“大家照徐总工程师的办法试验一窑。”试验的时候，生产组长孙学伦还有点不放心，可是第一窑烧出来，产品虽有点发硬，但焖火时间却缩短了五分之一。工人们这时有了信心，并且认真研究和改进了温度上升办法，克服了徐总工程师的办法中的缺点。
    这个先进焖火法实行后，从四月份到现在，焖火窑没有增加，翻砂的产量也没有降低，但是焖火产品的产量平均提高了一倍到一倍半，废品率也降低到百分之一，使马铁车间翻砂和焖火的生产不再脱节了，月月都超额完成国家计划。
    废料炼生铁，节约了四亿多元
    四年多来，国营天津中央电工器材制造西厂各车间积存下很多碎矽钢片和铁末，共约四百余吨。过去，大家都认为这是废料，于是就用它填坑、铺道，或当炉灰渣子使用，剩下来的就都堆积在院内。去年四月份，铸工组工人刘玉祥看到这一大堆东西，堆在院内，雨淋日晒，白白地浪费掉，觉着很可惜，就向领导方面提议，把这些碎矽钢片、铁末再熔炼成生铁，但是他的建议没有被领导方面重视。
    今年四月份，经过反官僚主义斗争，刘玉祥又提出了这个建议，这次得到了领导方面的支持。经过一番准备，四月十七日他就利用该厂原有的冷风炉来做熔炼试验，熔炼出来的生铁，经化验，出铁量达到百分之八十五以上，而且质量很好。同时用他炼出的生铁试铸了三台三十千伏安的变压器油箱，因为铁的组织比较严密，没有渗油的现象。
    试验虽然成功了，但是这个冷风炉铸工组每天要使用，不可能供给他长期熔炼生铁。刘玉祥就向领导建议，把院中放着的一个破烂的冷风炉，修理一下作熔炼生铁用，这样炉子的问题解决了。
    熔炼矽钢片和铁末的温度很高，炉内经常要烧到摄氏一千八百度以上，炉壁浸蚀得很快，炼了二、三吨铁之后就要修理一次炉壁，这拖长了熔炼的时间。刘玉祥把厂里用剩的云母粉（已经没有用处）收集起来，把它和做耐火砖的材料混合在一起来糊炉壁，解决了炉壁容易坏的问题，现在修一次炉已经可以化七、八吨铁。到目前为止，该厂已经熔炼出约一百七十余吨的生铁（尚有碎矽钢片和铁末约二百吨还未熔炼），据初步统计，以三百万元一吨折算（除去三十万元成本费），刘玉祥这个建议已经给国家节约了约四亿五千余万元的财富。
    弹簧箍的困难解决了
    青岛四方机车车辆制造厂从今年七月下旬起，开始了下半年新造机车和客车的生产任务。在制造新机车和客车配件时，锻冶车间首先遇到了一个困难，弹簧箍做出来不合标准，每天有百分之八十以上的产品是废品。而弹簧箍需要却很多，一台客车要用三十二个，机车的煤水车每台也要用二十四个，所以做了好几天，总是不能按计划向装配车间交活，车间领导上和工人们都很着急。
    这时技术员李元进就下了车间，和工人一起研究如何提高弹簧箍质量的办法。他先找做弹簧箍的工人杜金凭、董文绪等了解他们的操作情况，并具体地教会他们怎样掌握铁的温度，弹簧箍的原料在炉里应当热到什么程度，和每次要烧到多少个等操作问题。这样随时研究、步步改进以后，产品质量果然有了提高。李元进和工人研究后，还创造了八种制造弹簧箍的专用工具，一下就使弹簧箍的生产效率提高了两倍多。过去一个汽锤工作组，每天费很大的劲，只能锻造弹簧箍二十个左右，现在每天可以完成六十四个，质量还有很大提高，废品率从百分之八十降低到百分之七以下。李元进和工人还订了一个合同，要使弹簧箍的质量达到百分之九十八以上。八月上旬以后，锻造弹簧箍的汽锤工作组每天都能按计划进度完成任务，把合乎标准的弹簧箍一批批地交给装配车间。　（李鸿起）
    节约“半分洋元”
    国营上海第二纺织机械厂第一机工场高明山小组，是全车间用料最多的，单是大小尺寸的洋元，每月就得用上三、四千根。生产任务一下来，由供销科落料，按照老规矩，落料时每根洋元轴头放长半分，两头就放长一分，作为车平面时的车污耗损。三年来，生产科这样开材料准备单，供销科这样订材料消耗定额，明明知道这里有浪费，但谁也没有考虑它。有人说：“只要完成任务，多用点材料算什么！”因此，像半分洋元这样的小东西，更没有人去过问了。
    高明山是第一机工场第八小组的工长。他们小组最近讨论节约指标，女工贾洪妹提出节省半分洋元的“车污”。贾洪妹一向做车洋元两头平面的工作，她认为每根洋元车去一分“车污”，化费材料和人工很多，要是把“车污”改为半分，平面一样能车得光滑。高明山马上把这个意见转给供销科负责落料的同志。供销科接受了这个建议，并从九月份起实行。算了算细账，每根洋元节约半分，每年五万七千根洋元就可以节省二千八百五十吋；节省下来的人工、电力、车刀的耗费要值一千二百多万元。
    工会抓紧这节约半分洋元的事例进行宣传，教育大家讨论生产指标时不仅要注意完成产品产值任务而且要注意节约成本，那怕是一点一滴的节约，积累起来就能发挥很大的作用。　（吴云波）
