    Poor Quality of Plumbing Materials Supplied to Angang
    According to recent material acceptance checks by the Angang Steel Company's Materials Department, many materials are of poor quality, especially plumbing materials are the most serious. For example, Angang Steel Company and Anshan Materials Company signed three contracts in the first to third quarters, with a total of 230,000 pieces of equipment, of which more than 10,000 pieces were canceled due to poor quality. Recently, three carts of "tees" all had sand holes. After water pressure testing, they were returned due to failing quality standards. In July, Angang Steel Company bought 13,000 plumbing parts from Changchun Materials Company, including 7,000 "steam bag wire couplings." After inspection, only 22% were qualified, while 78% were unqualified. Other cast iron products such as "external connectors" were mostly of poor quality, resulting in a large number of returns. For example, the "double pressure plug water栓" required for the Angang Steel Company's seamless steel pipe plant project were purchased in Changchun, Shenyang and other places. After pressure testing, not a single one out of tens of thousands of pieces of equipment was qualified, so they had to be manufactured in-house.
    The main reason for the poor quality of plumbing materials is that processing units pursue quantity, neglect product quality, and lack a quality inspection system. Some private merchants' behavior of cutting corners and speculation is still very serious. On the other hand, some capital construction units, in order to meet project needs, only require specifications and quantity when purchasing, and do not pay attention to product quality, and have not implemented a quality responsibility system.
    At present, capital construction projects are in a construction boom, and ensuring the quality of plumbing equipment is a very important issue. In order to avoid waste and ensure project quality and supply, manufacturing units, capital construction units and relevant departments in various places should quickly take measures to improve the quality of plumbing materials.

    沈阳、长春等地 
    供应鞍钢的水暖材料质量很坏
    根据鞍山钢铁公司材料处最近验收材料证明，许多材料质量低劣，尤其是水暖材料最为严重。如鞍山钢铁公司第一季度一至第三季度与鞍山市器材公司共订三份合同，器材数量是二十三万件，其中因质量不好而废除合同的有万余件。最近又有三马车“三通”全部都有砂眼，经过水压试验，因质量不合而退货。七月间鞍山钢铁公司由长春器材公司买回水暖零件一万三千件，其中“汽包丝对”七千件，经过检查，合格品仅占百分之二十二，不合格品则占百分之七十八；其他铸铁制品如“外接头”等，绝大部分质量低劣，因而造成大量退货。又如鞍山钢铁公司无缝钢管厂工程所需的“二受压塞水栓”，在长春、沈阳等地采购，试压结果，上万件器材中连一个合格的也没有，因而不得不加工制造。
    造成水暖材料质量低劣的主要原因，是加工单位追求数量，忽视产品质量，缺乏质量检查制度；有些私商偷工减料、投机取巧的行为仍很严重。另一方面，有些基本建设单位为了满足工程需要，在采购时只要求规格、数量，对产品质量则不加过问，没有贯彻质量责任制。
    目前基本建设工程正在施工高潮，保证水暖器材质量是一个很重要的问题。为了避免浪费，保证工程质量和供应，各地制造单位与基本建设单位以及有关部门，应迅速采取措施，改进水暖材料的质量。（齐光）
