    Exposing the American Side's Lies of Using Terrorist Tactics to Fabricate Refusal of Repatriation by Our Captured Personnel
    Nine Korean People's Army Prisoners of War Return to the Motherland
    One Chinese People's Volunteer Prisoner of War Scheduled for Repatriation on the 16th
    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 15th] Nine Korean People's Army prisoners of war who broke through special agent control and requested repatriation returned to the embrace of the Republic at 11:00 AM today.
    The Indian Custodial Forces transported them from the prisoner of war camp to the Panmunjom conference area in a large truck, and directly handed them over to the Korean-Chinese side there. After the nine returnees got out of the truck, they formed a single line, led by a flag of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and sang "The Song of General Kim Il-sung" as they walked into the reception tent temporarily set up by the Korean-Chinese side.
    They were warmly welcomed by General Li Sang-cho, General Ding Guoyu, and the reception personnel of the Korean-Chinese side who were waiting in the tent.
    The handover ceremony lasted fifteen minutes, and some members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission were present to observe.
    These nine prisoners of war came from the American prisoner of war camps on Geoje Island and Busan. Under the threat of American bayonets, clubs, and death, they were deprived of the freedom to express their personal will and were listed as prisoners of war not to be directly repatriated. When the American side handed over the first batch of prisoners of war from the Korean-Chinese side who were not directly repatriated to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on September 10th, these nine people broke through the control of the Syngman Rhee special agent elements and requested repatriation from the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. According to the decision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, they were originally allowed to be handed over to the Korean-Chinese side by the Indian Custodial Forces the next day (September 11th) to enjoy the right of repatriation. However, the American side attempted to participate in the repatriation arrangements, even wanting to send the repatriated prisoners of war through the hands of the American side, which delayed the repatriation time by four days. Now, these nine prisoners of war have been directly handed over to the Korean-Chinese side, which has foiled the American side's conspiracy to give the repatriated prisoners of war mental threats in the last minute.
    Four days ago, when the first batch of non-directly repatriated Korean-Chinese prisoners of war were handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the American propaganda machine described these prisoners of war as people who "quickly showed their aversion to communism," and described the harassment of the Korean-Chinese observer representatives planned by the Syngman Rhee special agent elements as an "angry" "demonstration." However, the fact is that when there was a little opportunity to express the freedom of personal will, these nine people among the non-directly repatriated prisoners of war quickly requested repatriation. They abandoned the Rhee bandit Taegeuk flag that the American military and special agent elements forced them to take, and during the four days they were separately guarded by the Indian troops waiting for repatriation, they newly made a flag of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and remodeled American military caps into Korean People's Army military caps, and made red five-pointed star cap badges. Today, their excited expressions upon returning to Panmunjom and returning to the embrace of the motherland deeply moved the people around them. When they were riding in ambulances leaving Panmunjom and heading to the Kaesong reception station, they sang "The Song of General Kim Il-sung" to their heart's content, and stretched the Republic's flag out of the car window to flutter in the wind.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 15th] After nine Korean People's Army prisoners of war broke through special agent control to request repatriation and returned to the embrace of the motherland on the 15th, another non-directly repatriated Chinese People's Volunteer prisoner of war, disregarding the threat of Chiang Kai-shek special agents in the prisoner of war camp, requested repatriation. Lieutenant General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, notified the Korean-Chinese side on the 15th that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has decided to repatriate this Chinese People's Volunteer prisoner of war who requested repatriation at Panmunjom on the morning of the 16th. This Chinese People's Volunteer prisoner of war immediately requested repatriation upon arriving in the demilitarized zone, once again exposing the American side's lies of fabricating the refusal of repatriation of Korean-Chinese captured personnel by using all kinds of inhuman and terrorist means.

    揭穿美方用恐怖手段制造我方被俘人员拒绝遣返的鬼话
    朝鲜人民军被俘人员九人返回祖国
    我志愿军被俘人员一人定十六日遣返
    【新华社开城十五日电】九个突破特务控制要求遣返的朝鲜人民军被俘人员，在今天上午十一时回到了共和国怀抱。
    印度看管部队从战俘营地用一辆大卡车把他们载送到板门店会场区，并在那里直接移交给朝中方面。九名归来人员下车以后，排成一路纵队，以一面朝鲜民主主义人民共和国国旗为前导，唱着“金日成将军之歌”，走进朝中方面临时搭设的接收帐篷。
    他们受到了在帐篷中等候的李相朝将军、丁国钰将军及朝中方面接收人员的热烈欢迎。
    接交仪式历时十五分钟，中立国遣返委员会的部分委员在场观察。
    这九名被俘人员来自巨济岛和釜山美军战俘营，他们在美军刺刀、棍棒和死亡的威胁下，被剥夺表达个人意志的自由而列为不直接遣返的战俘。在九月十日美方将第一批没有直接遣返的朝中方面的战俘移交给中立国遣返委员会看管的时候，他们九个人便突破李承晚特务分子的控制，向中立国遣返委员会要求遣返。按照中立国遣返委员会的决定，他们原被允许在第二天（九月十一日）即由印度看管部队移交给朝中方面，享受遣返的权利。但美方企图参与遣返工作的安排，竟要把遣返战俘经由美方之手遣送，以致遣返时间延迟了四天之久。现在，这九位被俘人员已直接移交给朝中方面，这就使美方企图在最后一刻钟内给予遣返的战俘以精神威胁的阴谋落空了。
    在四天以前首批不直接遣返的朝中战俘移交给中立国遣返委员会的时候，美国宣传机器曾把这批战俘形容为“很快地表现出对共产主义厌恶”的人，把李承晚特务分子所策划的对朝中观察代表的骚扰行动描写为“怒气冲冲”的“示威”。然而，事实却是，在有一点机会表达个人意志自由的时候，不直接遣返战俘中的这九个人便迅速地要求遣返。他们抛弃了美军和特务分子强迫他们拿的李匪太极旗，而在被印度部队单独看管等待遣返的四天当中，新制了一面朝鲜民主主义人民共和国国旗，把美国军帽改制成朝鲜人民军军帽，并做了红五角星的帽徽。今天，他们一回到板门店，重回祖国怀抱的兴奋表情深深地感动了周围的人们。当他们乘坐着救护车离开板门店驰往开城接待站的时候，他们又尽情地唱起了“金日成将军之歌”，并且把共和国国旗伸到车窗外迎风飘扬。
    【新华社开城十五日电】在九名朝鲜人民军被俘人员突破特务控制要求遣返并已在十五日回到祖国怀抱之后，又有未直接遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员一人，不顾战俘营中蒋介石特务的威胁要求遣返。中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅中将十五日通知朝中方面，中立国遣返委员会已决定在十六日上午在板门店把这一位要求遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员予以遣返。这一位中国人民志愿军被俘人员在到达非军事区后立即要求遣返，再次揭穿了美方用一切惨无人道的恐怖手段所制造的朝中被俘人员拒绝遣返的鬼话。
