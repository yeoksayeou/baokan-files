    The Secretariat of the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League recently issued a notice regarding the conversion of probationary members absorbed before the Second National Congress of the China New Democratic Youth League to full membership.

    The Youth League Constitution passed by the First National Congress of the China New Democratic Youth League stipulated that newly recruited members would have a certain probationary period. This was absolutely necessary at the time when the majority of regions across the country had not long been liberated, and the Youth League organization was just beginning to be established. Its purpose was to provide probationary members with necessary education and observation over a certain period to ensure the purity of the Youth League organization. Now that the Youth League organization has a national scope, the vast majority of advanced youth have convenient conditions to receive the education and observation of the League. Therefore, the probationary period stipulation seems unnecessary. For this reason, the new Youth League Constitution passed by the Second National Congress of the China New Democratic Youth League abolished the original Youth League Constitution's stipulation regarding the probationary period. In order to prudently and seriously handle the issue of converting probationary members absorbed before this Congress to full membership, the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Youth League made the following regulations in the notice: The issue of converting probationary members already in the League before the implementation of the new League Constitution should still be handled according to the decisions made by the League organization to which the member belonged regarding the probationary period when they joined the League. Those probationary members whose probationary period has expired and who already meet the conditions for full membership should be converted to full membership on time. Those whose probationary period has not expired but who have indeed met the conditions for full membership can also be converted to full membership in advance. Those whose probationary period has expired but who do not yet meet the conditions for full membership may have their probationary member status revoked or their probationary period extended, depending on the specific circumstances. The extension of the probationary period of a probationary member shall not exceed the original stipulated probationary period. If they still do not meet the conditions for full membership at that time, they should have the reasons explained to them and their probationary member status revoked.

    中国新民主主义青年团中央书记处
    发出关于处理候补团员转正问题的通知
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记处，最近发出关于处理中国新民主主义青年团第二次全国代表大会以前吸收的候补团员转正问题的通知。
    在中国新民主主义青年团第一次全国代表大会所通过的团章中，曾规定了新吸收的团员有一定的候补期，这在当时全国大部地区解放不久，青年团的组织尚在开始建立的时候，是完全必要的。它的目的，是为了在一定期间内对候补团员给以必要的教育和考察，以保证青年团的组织的纯洁性。现在青年团的组织已具有全国的规模，广大先进青年都已有了接受团的教育和考察的便利条件，因此，候补期的规定，就显得不必要了。为此，中国新民主主义青年团第二次全国代表大会所通过的新团章中就取消了原有团章中关于候补期的规定。为了慎重地严肃地处理在这次代表大会以前吸收的候补团员转正的问题，青年团中央书记处在通知中作了如下规定：对于在新团章施行前团内已有的候补团员的转正问题，仍应按其本人入团时所属团的组织，对其候补期限所作的决定进行处理。凡候补团员的候补期已满，并已具备正式团员条件者，即应按时转正；候补期未满，但确已具备正式团员条件者，亦可提前转正；候补期虽满，但尚不具备正式团员条件者，得根据具体情况决定取消其候补团员资格或延长其候补期。候补团员候补期的延长不得超过其原规定的候补期限，届时仍不具备正式团员条件者，则应说清道理，取消其候补团员资格。    （新华社）
