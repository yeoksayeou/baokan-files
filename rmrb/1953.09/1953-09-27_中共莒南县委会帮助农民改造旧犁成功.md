    CCP Junan County Committee Helps Farmers Successfully Transform Old Plows
    The old plows of farmers, after being researched and transformed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Junan County Committee in Shandong Province, have been welcomed by the vast majority of farmers.
    Many farmers in Junan County are still using old plows that were used hundreds of years ago. These plows are difficult for livestock to pull and do not plow deeply, which greatly affects improving production. In recent years, although the People's Government has promoted some seven-inch walking plows, many farmers, especially individual farmers, have not been able to purchase them in large quantities due to their high prices. Therefore, this spring, the CCP Junan County Committee sent cadres and the county's farm implement factory and technical workers to study the transformation of old plows. After painstaking research and multiple revisions, the results of the new plow after transformation have been very useful in local general land experiments. Now they have manufactured a type of plow suitable for mountainous and general land, and a type of plow suitable for black mud land. Both of these plows are suitable for local farming conditions. They are light and easy to use for plowing, saving labor for both people and cattle, and they plow flatter than old plows without missing plow ridges; the plows are also stable and easy to hold, can plow deeply, and are simple and inexpensive. An old plow only needs to be replaced with a plowshare to be as good as a seven-inch walking plow. Each plowshare only costs over 5,000 RMB, which farmers can afford. The CCP Junan County Committee has now planned to promote 200 of them during this year's autumn plowing, and then widely promote them during next year's spring plowing. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中共莒南县委会帮助农民改造旧犁成功
    中共山东省莒南县委员会对农民的旧犁经过研究改造后，受到了广大农民的欢迎。
    莒南县很多农民目前还用着数百年前就使用的旧犁，这种犁牲口拉起来很费力还耕不深，对提高产量很受影响。近年来虽然人民政府曾推广了一些七吋步犁，但由于价格较高，许多农民特别是个体农民还不能大量的购买。因此今年春季，中共莒南县委员会就派了干部和该县农具工厂、技术工人一起研究旧犁的改造工作。经过苦心钻研和多次修改，改造后的新犁在当地一般土地上试验的结果已经很好用了。现在他们已制造出一种适合山地和一般土地用的犁，一种适合黑泥地用的犁，这两种犁都适合当地耕作条件。耕地时轻便、人牛省力，比旧犁耕的平坦还不漏犁埂；犁也稳当好扶，能深耕，并且简单省钱，一个旧犁只需要换上一个鑱头就可顶七吋步犁使用，每个鑱头只售人民币五千余元，农民都买得起。现中共莒南县委员会已计划在今年秋耕中推广二百个，到明年春耕时再普遍推广。（新华社）
