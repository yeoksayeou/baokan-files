Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, 10th. The early autumn crops on both sides of the Huai River have generally had a bumper harvest. The late autumn crops are also growing very well. On both banks of the Hong River, a stretch of more than 800 li in Henan Province, in the upper reaches of the Huai River, which has suffered from floods year after year, a harvest unprecedented in many years has been achieved thanks to the construction of flood storage projects for harnessing the Huai River. The average sorghum yield is more than 200 jin per mu, with the highest yield in Runan County reaching more than 280 jin. In the Huaibei Plain of Anhui Province, in the middle reaches of the Huai River, the output of sorghum, corn, and millet has increased by about 20% compared to last year. The low-lying areas on both banks of the Bei Fei River, which used to yield nothing, harvested more than 200 jin of sorghum per mu this year. The rice on the Subei Plain has long ears and plump grains. The harvested early rice has increased by about 10% compared to last year.

The reasons for the bumper harvest of early autumn crops on both sides of the Huai River this year include not only the progress of the Huai River harnessing project, which has gradually eliminated the floods of the Huai River, but also the continuous struggle of the vast number of farmers on both sides of the Huai River against natural disasters. For example, under the slogan of "Overcoming Natural Disasters and Striving for a Bumper Autumn Harvest," farmers in the Huaibei area of Anhui Province used methods such as carrying water to sow seeds and seizing moisture and borrowing moisture to replant, enabling more than 4.8 million mu of autumn seedlings to grow again. During the spring and summer, farmers in the Huaibei area of Anhui Province also vigorously built small-scale farmland water conservancy projects, dredging more than 7,780 ditches and canals and digging more than 170,000 ponds and wells, freeing more than 3 million mu of land from historical floods. Now, farmers on both sides of the Huai River are continuing to fight drought and eliminate pests, striving for a comprehensive bumper harvest.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 10th. The autumn crops in Tai'an Prefecture, Shandong Province, which were waterlogged and submerged by river water, still yielded a bumper harvest after drainage and rescue. The 21,600 mu of autumn crops in western Tai'an, which suffered more severe waterlogging, can still approach last year's output after drainage; the 23,200 mu of autumn crops in the eastern part, which suffered from waterlogging, can increase by an average of 10% compared to last year. In Jianwenhe Township, District 6 of the county, after drainage, farmer Wang Shengquan harvested 439 jin of corn per mu. Song Chunfu's late millet on wheat stubble harvested 266 and a half jin per mu, an increase of more than 40 jin per mu compared to last year.

Since the beginning of summer, due to concentrated rainfall in Tai'an Prefecture, Shandong Province, the Xiaoqing River, Wen River, Zhao Niu River, and other rivers have overflowed, and all low-lying areas in the twelve counties along the river, including Feicheng, Wenshang, Dongping, Tai'an, and Laiwu, have suffered from varying degrees of waterlogging of autumn crops. The Communist Party committees and people's governments in the areas along the river have all regarded drainage to protect autumn as the central task overriding everything else in order to prevent autumn grain from decreasing in production due to waterlogging. He Jianqiu, Deputy Commissioner of the Tai'an Administrative Office, and Liu Zhongqian, Deputy Secretary of the Tai'an Local Committee of the Communist Party of China, personally led more than 60 cadres to the waterlogged areas to provide specific guidance on drainage and autumn protection work. After waterlogging occurred in District 9 of Tai'an County, more than 700 farmers were mobilized throughout the district, and under the leadership of the cadres of various townships, they actively searched for drainage routes and dug 42 drainage ditches within two days, promptly draining the accumulated water from more than 8,500 mu of autumn crops. Now, the accumulated water has been completely drained from the autumn crops in Tai'an Prefecture that were waterlogged and submerged by river water, and farmers are nervously carrying out harvesting. Early autumn crops in Tai'an, Wenshang, and other counties have been harvested; late-planted corn and millet have also begun to be harvested.

    淮河两岸早秋作物丰收晚秋作物生长良好
    山东泰安专区受涝庄稼经抢救后仍获丰收
    【新华社蚌埠十日电】淮河两岸的早秋作物普遍丰收。晚秋作物生长的也很好。淮河上游河南省年年发生涝灾的八百多华里长的洪河两岸，由于治淮蓄洪工程的兴修，获得了好多年来所未有的丰收，高粱产量平均每亩二百多斤，汝南县最高产量达到二百八十多斤。淮河中游安徽省淮北平原的高粱、玉米和谷子比去年增产两成左右。过去经常颗粒无收的北淝河两岸的洼地，今年每亩收了二百多斤高粱。苏北平原上的水稻，穗长粒肥。已收割的早稻较去年增产一成左右。
    今年淮河两岸早秋作物获得丰收的原因，除治淮工程的进行，逐步消除了淮河的水灾外，淮河两岸广大农民不断向自然灾害作斗争，也是丰收的原因之一。如安徽省淮北地区的农民在“战胜自然灾害，争取秋季丰收”的口号下，用担水点种和抢墒、借墒补种的方法，使四百八十多万亩秋苗重新生长起来。在春夏期间安徽省淮北地区农民又大力兴修了小型农田水利，先后疏浚沟渠七千七百八十多条，挖塘、打井十七万多口，使三百多万亩地免除了历史上的涝灾。现在，淮河两岸的农民正继续进行抗旱、灭虫，争取全面丰收。
    【新华社济南十日电】山东省泰安专区遭受内涝被河水淹没的秋庄稼经排水抢救后仍获丰收。泰安西部受内涝灾害较重的二万一千六百亩秋季作物，经排水后还可接近去年产量；东部受涝的二万三千二百亩秋季作物，平均可比去年增产一成。该县六区渐汶河乡，经排水后，农民王盛泉的玉米每亩收了四百三十九斤。宋春福的麦茬晚谷每亩收二百六十六斤半。每亩比去年增产四十多斤。
    入夏以来，山东省泰安专区因雨量集中，小清河、汶河、赵牛河等河流漫溢，沿河之肥城、汶上、东平、泰安、莱芜等十二县所有低洼地区，秋季作物都受到了不同程度的内涝灾害。沿河地区中共党委和人民政府，为了不使秋粮因涝减产，都把排水保秋当做压倒一切的中心任务。泰安专署副专员何剑秋和中共泰安地方委员会副书记刘众前并亲自带领六十多名干部到受涝地区具体指导排水保秋工作。泰安县九区发生内涝后，全区动员了七百多个农民，在各个乡的干部领导下积极找寻排水路线，两天内挖排水沟四十二条，及时地把八千五百多亩秋季作物地里的积水排出。现在，泰安专区遭受内涝、受河水淹没的秋季作物，已将积水全部排出，农民正紧张进行收割。泰安、汶上等县早秋作物已收割完毕；晚种的玉米、谷子也已开镰。
