Forever Living in People's Hearts
He Rihong, Xiao Chi, Zhang Jie

Lu Yuqiu and Zhang Minglu, soldiers of a certain unit's stretcher company of the Chinese People's Volunteers and members of the Communist Youth League, who bravely rescued eight Korean women, will forever live in the hearts of the Korean people at the foot of Mount Kumgang in Pyeongsan County, Hwanghae Province, North Korea.

Around 10:00 AM on April 21st this year, a burning bomb dropped by an American plane set fire to an independent thatched house at the foot of Mount Kumgang. The wind blew the flames towards the wild grass on the hillside and the pine forest on the mountain. In an instant, a fire began to burn on Mount Kumgang.

The alarm bell rang in the village at the foot of the mountain not far from the hut, and crowds of people fighting the fire - volunteer soldiers and Korean people - flocked to Mount Kumgang from all directions. Although Lu Yuqiu and Zhang Minglu had not slept all night due to their mission, they rushed to the mountain to fight the fire despite their fatigue.

People faced the flames, chopping trees with axes, shoveling soil with spades, and cutting grass with sickles, fighting the fire in the rolling thick smoke. However, the fire spread with the wind. Just as the flames were extinguished here, thick smoke rose again in the pine forest there.

Lu Yuqiu, Zhang Minglu, and everyone else put out the fire on the south hill and rushed after the fire to the second hill to put out the fire. At this time, four Korean girls, Ji Shizi, Li Zhenshu, Zheng Jingnan, and Shen Xuanhua, all sixteen or seventeen years old, were left to guard on Nanshan.

Unexpectedly, just as Lu Yuqiu, Zhang Minglu, and others rushed to the second hill, the fire on the south hill suddenly reignited. The raging fire quickly surrounded the four Korean girls, the flames only three meters away from them, burning them dizzy and only prostrate on the ground crying. Lu Yuqiu and Zhang Minglu quickly rushed to Nanshan, covered their heads with clothes, rolled straight down from the top of the mountain where flames were rising, bravely rushed into the fire, and rescued the four Korean girls. Afterwards, Lu Yuqiu and Zhang Minglu, together with everyone else, put out all the fire.

A little after 2:00 PM, not long after Lu Yuqiu and Zhang Minglu returned from fighting the fire, they discovered black smoke rising from a small gully north of the south hill. They immediately ran towards the gully. At this moment, a strong wind suddenly blew, and the fire immediately turned into a raging blaze with the force of the wind, burning a patch of wild grass and forest of about 1,200 pyeong.

At this time, Korean nurses Li, Cui Chunfeng, Jin Chengyu, and Zheng Yunan, who had been fighting the fire here, were fearlessly facing the flames, braving the choking smoke, and cutting grass around the air-raid shelter where volunteer army supplies were piled. A gust of wind blew, and the raging fire quickly rolled over from their side, forming a huge ring of fire, surrounding them. The flames were getting closer and closer to their bodies, and their skin felt as if it was being cut by knives. Some people's hair was also burned. They felt dizzy and unsteady, and hugged each other tightly....

At this most dangerous moment, Lu Yuqiu and Zhang Minglu rushed into the fire circle, pushing and pulling them, leading them through the raging fire for more than 20 meters to the north, out of the danger zone. They only saw that Lu Yuqiu and Zhang Minglu's faces were blackened by the smoke, shouted to them, "Are there any more people?" and rushed back into the smoke and fire. The rolling smoke and flames immediately covered them.

At this time, the fire was getting fiercer and fiercer. The flames soared into the sky for a while, and rolled towards the top of the mountain for a while. The four Korean women anxiously ran blindly after the flames for a while outside the fire circle, and stared at the crazy raging fire outside the fire circle for a while. When the flames had just subsided and thin smoke was still rising from the pine forest, they walked into the charred pine forest, stepping on the hot grass ash and black and red dry fruit, frantically searching for Lu Yuqiu and Zhang Minglu. Finally, when they saw two human bodies lying on the black ash, they cried out in shock, and then burst into tears with a "wow."

Nurse Li returned home with tears in her eyes, hugged her two-year-old son tightly, and cried loudly. She said, word by word, with tears in her eyes: "Child! If it weren't for the two volunteer army uncles who saved me, you would never see your mother again....". The local Korean people also passed on the immortal deeds of Lu Yuqiu and Zhang Minglu's selfless rescue with tears in their eyes. On May 4th, the local Korean people held a solemn memorial service. At the meeting, the Korean people's representative delivered a eulogy saying, "The noble qualities and great internationalist spirit of the two martyrs will forever live in our hearts." The local people also presented the company where Lu Yuqiu and Zhang Minglu served with a silk banner with the word "Kin" written on it. On the third anniversary of the "June 25th" Korean people's war against aggression, Korean nurse Li and others who were rescued and the local people came to the martyrs' tomb to pay their respects again. They cleared the weeds in front of the tomb, filled the tomb with a layer of new soil and sprinkled it with flowers. Nurse Li led her child to erect a wooden sign in front of the tomb. Li Xuezai, a 70-year-old Korean man, wrote a eulogy on the sign. The eight Korean women who were rescued also organized a "Lu Yuqiu and Zhang Minglu Production Shock Brigade," determined to commemorate these two immortal internationalist fighters with excellent production achievements.

On August 22nd, a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the local Korean people jointly erected a stone tablet as tall as a person on a small hill covered with green pines near Mount Kumgang. The deeds of the great internationalist fighters Lu Yuqiu and Zhang Minglu are engraved on the stele in both Korean and Chinese. In front of the stele is a highway leading to Haeju. People passing by often walk up the hillside with reverence to read the inscription and pay their respects at the tombs of the two martyrs, Lu Yuqiu and Zhang Minglu.

    永远活在人们的心里
    何日红、肖池、张洁
    舍身抢救八位朝鲜妇女的中国人民志愿军某部担架营战士、青年团员吕玉久和张明禄，永远活在朝鲜北部黄海道平泉郡金刚山下朝鲜人民的心里。
    今年四月二十一日上午十时左右，一架美国飞机掷下的燃烧弹烧着了金刚山下的一座独立草房。风把火苗吹向山坡上的野草和山上的松林。顷刻间，大火便在金刚山上燃烧起来。
    离小屋不远的山下村子里，响起了报警的钟声，救火的人群——志愿军战士和朝鲜人民从四面八方拥上金刚山。吕玉久和张明禄虽然因为执行任务一夜没有睡觉，也不顾疲劳地赶到山上去救火。
    人们迎着火头，用斧头砍树、用铁锹铲土、用镰刀割草，在滚滚浓烟里和大火搏斗。但是，大火随风蔓延，这里的火焰刚刚扑灭，那里的松林又冒起了浓烟。
    吕玉久、张明禄和大家一道扑灭了南山头上的火，又紧随火势赶到第二个山头上去救火。这时南山上留着吉时子、李贞淑、郑景南、申铉花四个十六七岁的朝鲜姑娘在看守。
    不料，当吕玉久、张明禄等刚扑上第二个山头的时候，忽然，南山头上的火又重新燃烧起来。烈火迅速地把四个朝鲜姑娘包围起来，火头离她们只有三公尺远，灼得她们头晕眼花，只是伏在地上哭叫。吕玉久、张明禄迅速赶到南山，用衣服蒙着头，从冒着火苗的山顶上直滚下来，奋勇地冲进大火，把四个朝鲜姑娘救了出来。以后，吕玉久和张明禄又和大家一起，把大火全部扑灭。
    下午两点多钟，吕玉久、张明禄救火回来不久，又发现南山头北边的小山沟里冒起了黑烟。他们立即向山沟里飞跑过去。这时，猛然刮起一阵大风，火随风势，立刻变成熊熊的大火，烧着了方圆约有一千二百坪大的一片野草和树林。
    这时，早在这里救火的朝鲜妇女李护士、崔春凤、金城玉和郑玉男正奋不顾身地迎着火头，冒着呛人的浓烟，围着堆有志愿军物资的防空洞割草。一阵大风吹来，烈火迅速从她们的侧面翻滚过去，形成一个巨大的火圈，把她们包围起来了。烈火越来越迫近她们的身子，灼得她们的皮肤像被刀子割着似的疼痛。有的人头发也被烧着了。她们昏昏沉沉地觉得站立不稳，就紧紧地拥抱在一起……。
    在这最危险的时刻，吕玉久和张明禄扑进了火圈，连推带拉地领着她们冒着大火向北走了二十多公尺，脱离了危险区。她们只见吕玉久和张明禄的脸上被烟熏得乌黑，向她们喊了一声：“还有人吧！”就重新向烟火中冲去，滚腾的浓烟烈火立刻就把他们罩住了。
    这时，火势越来越猛。火焰一会腾向高空，一会又滚向山头。四个朝鲜妇女在火圈外着急得一会盲目地随着火焰向前奔跑，一会又伫立在火圈外死盯着疯狂的烈火。当火焰刚刚平息，松林还冒着薄烟的时候，她们便走进烧焦的松林，踏着灼热的草灰和黑红的枯果，慌乱地寻找着吕玉久和张明禄。最后当她们看到两具倒在黑灰上的人体时，都失声惊叫起来，接着哇的一声，眼泪就涌了出来。
    李护士含着眼泪回到家里，一把搂住她两岁的小儿子，放声痛哭。她一字一泪地说：“孩子呀！要不是两位志愿军叔叔救了我，你再永远也见不着妈妈了……。”当地朝鲜人民也都眼含泪水传颂着吕玉久、张明禄舍身救人的不朽事迹。五月四日当地朝鲜人民举行了隆重的追悼大会。会上，朝鲜人民代表致悼词说：“两位烈士高贵的品质和伟大的国际主义精神，永远活在我们的心里。”当地人民还赠给吕玉久、张明禄生前所在的连队一面写着“亲”字的锦旗。“六·二五”朝鲜人民反侵略战争三周年纪念日，被救的朝鲜妇女李护士等和当地人民又来到了烈士墓前祭奠。他们铲净墓前的野草，往墓上填了一层新土并且撒上了鲜花。李护士拉着孩子在墓前立了一个木牌。七十岁的朝鲜老人李雪载在牌上写了悼文。被救的八位朝鲜妇女，并组织了“吕玉久、张明禄生产突击队”，决心用优良的生产成绩，来纪念这两位不朽的国际主义战士。
    八月二十二日，中国人民志愿军某部和当地的朝鲜人民共同在金刚山附近的一个长满青松的小山上树立了一块一人高的石碑。碑上用朝中两国文字刻着伟大的国际主义战士吕玉久、张明禄的事迹。碑前是一条通往海州的大公路，路过的人们，常常怀着崇敬的心情走上山坡来阅读碑文和到吕玉久、张明禄两烈士墓前致敬。
