Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 10th. The Northwest Region's state-owned cotton textile industry system recently formulated a full-year production increase and savings plan based on the production situation in the first half of the year and the possibilities for the second half. It is estimated that the system will increase the value of yarn and cloth production for the state by 18.2 billion yuan throughout the year and, starting with savings, overfulfill the annual profit delivery plan by 11 percent.

The Northwest Region's state-owned cotton textile industry system's production increase and savings plan was formulated at a recent conference held by the Northwest Textile Industry Bureau attended by factory directors, Party committee secretaries, union chairpersons, and engineering and technical leaders. The factories plan to start from the following aspects to ensure the completion of the production increase and savings plan: First, fully utilize the existing machine equipment utilization rate to increase output. For example, the State-owned Shaanxi No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, which has relatively poor equipment, decided to increase the speed of the front roller of the spinning frame by two revolutions and increase the machine operation rate by one percent starting in September, thereby increasing the unit output of each spindle from 1.175 pounds to 1.195 pounds; similarly, by increasing the operation rate of weaving machines, the unit output of cloth will be increased by one yard. The annual increase in production value can reach 1.1 billion yuan. Second, save on cotton consumption and mechanical materials. The State-owned Northwest No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory proposed to start with strengthening the treatment of fallen cotton and utilizing knife-cut lint, so that the cotton consumption per piece of 32-count yarn is reduced from 395.81 jin to 394.5 jin; and starting with the control of forty-odd major materials, it proposed the slogan "use less new materials, utilize old materials, process and repair" to reduce the expenditure on material costs. In this way, repairing only 1,000 V-belts can save 30 million yuan. In addition, in terms of adjusting and streamlining redundant organizations and personnel, the entire region can transfer approximately 5% of the surplus personnel to basic construction departments, thereby reducing the expenditure on management fees. In addition, in terms of basic construction, the Northwest Region's cotton textile industry system has also formulated a production increase and savings plan.

Now, the Northwest Textile Industry Bureau and the Northwest Regional Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China have put forward the slogan "Overfulfill and complete the national plan ahead of schedule" to all employees, and organized two work teams to go to the factories to help with the work. The workers of each factory are carrying out labor competitions in conjunction with the central task of implementing the operation plan.

    西北国营棉纺织业订出全年增产节约计划
    争取增产价值一百八十二亿元的纱并超额完成上缴利润
    【新华社西安十日电】西北区国营棉纺织工业系统最近根据上半年的生产情况和下半年的可能，制订了今年全年的增产节约计划。预计全年将为国家增产价值一百八十二亿元的纱布，并从节约入手，超额百分之十一完成全年的上缴利润计划。
    西北区国营棉纺织工业系统这个增产节约计划，是在西北纺织工业管理局最近召开的各厂厂长、党委书记、工会主席和工程技术负责干部会上制订的。各厂准备从下面几个方面着手来保证完成增产节约计划：第一是充分利用现有机器设备利用率来提高产量。如设备较差的国营陕西第一棉纺织厂，决定从九月份开始把细纱机前罗拉速度加快两转，机器开车率增加百分之一，从而使每个纱锭的单位产量从一点一七五磅增加到一点一九五磅；同样用增加织布机开车率的办法使布的单位产量增加一码。全年增产价值可达十一亿元。第二是节约用棉量和机物料。国营西北第一棉纺织厂提出要从加强处理落棉和利用斩刀花着手，使每件三十二支纱的用棉量从三百九十五点八一市斤，减少到三百九十四点五市斤；并从控制四十几种主要材料着手，提出“少用新料，利用旧料，加工修理”的口号，减少材料费用的开支。这样仅修理一千根三角皮带，就可节省三千万元。其他在调整和精减重复机构、人员方面，全区约可把编余百分之五的人员输送给基本建设部门，从而减少管理费用的开支。此外，在基本建设方面，西北区棉纺织工业系统也已订出了增产节约的计划。
    现在，西北纺织工业管理局和中国纺织工会西北区委员会已向全体职工提出“超额提前完成国家计划”的口号，并组织了两个工作组下厂帮助工作。各厂职工正结合推行作业计划的中心工作，开展劳动竞赛。
