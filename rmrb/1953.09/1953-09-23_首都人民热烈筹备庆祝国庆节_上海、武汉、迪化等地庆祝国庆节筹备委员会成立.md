The rhythmic and magnificent sound of waist drums can be heard everywhere in the evenings. In the parade, there will also be a sports contingent of more than 3,000 people demonstrating the strong physique of the Chinese people. Athletes attending the "1953 National Track and Field, Gymnastics, and Cycling Games" will also participate in the parade; literary and art workers will form a literary and art contingent of more than 4,000 people, including four outstanding dance troupes.
