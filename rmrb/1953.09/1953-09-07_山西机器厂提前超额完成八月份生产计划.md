The Shanxi Machine Factory, on the basis of consolidating labor discipline and carrying out labor emulation drives, strengthened technical management and pre-fulfilled and exceeded its August production task. In July, due to chaotic management, lax discipline, and unclear responsibilities, the factory experienced many accidents, high absenteeism, and low quality, resulting in the completion of only 75.3% of the monthly production task.

Having learned from the lessons of July, the factory's leading cadres strengthened technical management in August, rectified labor discipline, and launched labor emulation drives, overcoming the chaotic phenomena in work, reducing accidents, and ensuring attendance rates, which significantly improved product quality. First, a "Scrap Products Exhibition" was held to criticize erroneous ideas that disregarded quality. After this, workers were able to operate according to operating procedures, greatly reducing the scrap rate. The rework rate of the forging workshop decreased from 26% to 10%, while the rework rate of Xu Yaoshan's group decreased from 60% to 9%. Secondly, the allocation of machines and labor was adjusted according to the plan. The metalworking workshop did not have enough machines, so personnel and machines from tool and other workshops were mobilized to provide support. The casting workshop also readjusted the number of technicians and personnel in each group according to the production tasks. In terms of safe production, machine accidents in August decreased from more than ten in July to three, and the monthly attendance rate reached more than 90%, while the attendance rate in the forging workshop reached 96%.

The factory not only pre-fulfilled and exceeded its August production task, but also completely made up for the production tasks that were in arrears from July.

    山西机器厂提前超额完成八月份生产计划
    山西机器厂在巩固劳动纪律和开展劳动竞赛的基础上，加强了技术管理，八月份生产任务提前超额完成。该厂七月份，由于管理混乱，纪律松弛，职责不清，造成了事故多，缺勤多，质量低，使全月生产任务只完成了百分之七十五点三。
    该厂领导干部接受了七月份的教训，在八月份加强了技术管理工作，整顿劳动纪律，开展劳动竞赛，克服了工作上的混乱现象，减少了事故，保证了出勤率，产品质量显著提高。首先举行了“废品展览”，批判了忽视质量的错误思想后，都能按着操作规程操作，使报废率大大降低。锻工车间的退修率由百分之二十六降到百分之十，而许耀山小组的退修率已由百分之六十降到百分之九了。其次按计划调整了机器和劳力的配备，金工车间机器不够用，机动地抽调出工具等车间的人员和机器来支援；铸工车间也按着生产任务，重新调整了技术员和各组的人数。在安全生产上，八月份的机器事故由七月份的十余次减少为三次，全月出勤率达到了百分之九十以上，而锻工车间出勤率已达到百分之九十六。
    该厂不仅提前超额完成了八月份生产任务，并把七月份所亏空的生产任务完全补足了。
