    Regarding the Military Armistice Commission Headquarters Area
    Agreement in Principle Reached Between Both Sides

    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 4th] Regarding the Military Armistice Commission Headquarters Area and the Joint Security Area of the headquarters location, the Korean-Chinese side and the American side have reached an agreement in principle. The Korean-Chinese side dispatched security personnel to the Joint Security Area on the 4th to perform their duties, and will immediately transport construction personnel and materials to the construction site within the Joint Security Area to construct buildings for the headquarters of Military Armistice Commission, Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. The buildings required for the three headquarters will be shared equally by both sides, who will be responsible for construction respectively.

    The Military Armistice Commission Headquarters Area has been expanded from the original Panmunjom conference area and is a rectangular area extending north and south from the demilitarized zone. The offices and necessary residences for the staff of the Military Armistice Commission, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and its affiliated institutions will all be built within the headquarters area.

    Within the headquarters area, a circular joint security area for both sides will be established across the military demarcation line, including buildings used by the headquarters of the three organizations, as well as the Panmunjom Bridge and the road leading to the headquarters through the southern part of the demilitarized zone. The specific scope of the circular area is yet to be determined by the technical personnel of both sides. As the military demarcation line has been moved southward, and the US side requested that the headquarters be located on the military demarcation line, the Korean-Chinese side agreed to this request and moved the location of the headquarters buildings to a location approximately two kilometers southeast of Panmunjom.

    关于军事停战委员会总部区
    双方已在原则上达成协议
    【新华社开城四日电】关于军事停战委员会总部区及总部所在地的共同警卫区，朝中方面与美方已在原则上达成协议。朝中方面已于四日派出警卫人员进入共同警卫区执行任务，并将立即运送建筑人员和建筑材料前往共同警卫区内的建筑现场，修建供军事停战委员会、中立国监察委员会和中立国遣返委员会总部使用的建筑物。三个总部所需的建筑物，将由双方平均分担，分别负责修建。
    军事停战委员会总部区由原来的板门店会场区扩大而成，是一个迄非军事区南北两缘的长方形地区。军事停战委员会、中立国监察委员会和中立国遣返委员会及其附属机构的办公处所，以及工作人员的必要住所，都修建在总部区之内。
    在总部区内，横跨军事分界线，设有一圆形的双方共同警卫区，其中包括三个机构的总部使用的建筑物，以及板门桥和经过非军事区南部通向总部的公路。圆形地区的具体范围，尚待双方技术人员确定。由于军事分界线已向南推移，而美方又要求将总部设在军事分界线上，朝中方面同意了这个要求，将总部建筑物的位置迁移到板门店东南约两公里的地点。
