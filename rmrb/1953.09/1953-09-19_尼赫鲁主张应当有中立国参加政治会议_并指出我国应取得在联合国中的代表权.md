Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 18th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru delivered a speech in the Indian Parliament's House of the People on September 17th.

    In his speech, Prime Minister Nehru discussed the Korean political conference, stating: "Now, the United Nations is about to discuss these issues, and I know that the Chinese People's Government has put forward some counter-proposals in its response to the United Nations' suggestions. First of all, it should be remembered that all parties have agreed to hold a Korean political conference, to implement the Korean armistice there, and to try to resolve the issues. They unanimously agreed on the task of the political conference. The only issue that everyone is still considering or arguing about is the composition of this conference. It should also be remembered that such a conference cannot be decided by a majority vote. It cannot be decided in this way—obviously not. It will more or less be decided by the consensus and agreement of most of the parties concerned, if not unanimously. It doesn't matter if there are a few more countries on this side or that side, unless the more countries participating, the more difficult it may be to work; otherwise, there is no particular difficulty."

    Prime Minister Nehru said: "The real question at the moment is whether neutral countries should participate in this conference. Our opinion is that it would be beneficial to have such countries participate, because they can sometimes reconcile differences and ease tensions. The real agreement must naturally be reached between the other parties. The neutral country will not bring about the agreement, it will only help create a certain atmosphere sufficient to lead other countries to reach an agreement."

    Nehru said that the Korean issue is an Asian issue. He said:
    "Asian countries do not want to be ignored, do not want to be left aside, and certainly do not want to be scolded."

    Nehru talked about the results of the vote in the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on India's participation in the Korean political conference, saying: The vote produced some interesting results. "Twenty-one votes were against India, of which eighteen were votes cast by the Americas, and seventeen of the eighteen votes were cast by so-called Latin America. I have great respect for the countries of Latin America. There is no doubt about that. But the fact shows that when almost all European countries and almost all Asian countries need something in the political conference, many countries throughout the Americas do not want this thing. Of course, they have every right not to want this thing, just as they have every right to want this thing. However, what we are considering is the Asian issue, the issue of Asia. Since some people who have nothing to do with this issue are indeed not as concerned as Asians, can the will of Asia be despised? Can the combined will of Asia and Europe be despised? This is a very special situation."

    Prime Minister Nehru talked about the issue of the People's Republic of China's representation in the United Nations, saying: "For some time in the past, one of the issues before the United Nations has been whether to admit the People's Republic of China as a member of the United Nations. People have always had some confused ideas about this issue when they talk about allowing China to join the United Nations. This is not a question of allowing China to participate in the United Nations; China is one of the five founding countries of the United Nations. The only issue that is debatable is: Who represents China? Can anyone say that the current government in Taiwan can represent China? In fact, can any guarantee put forward by Taiwan be implemented in China? Obviously not. They cannot put forward guarantees on behalf of China. Therefore, if someone who cannot speak for China, someone who cannot do anything in China, someone who cannot have any influence on China, but at best can only express fierce opposition to China, is said to represent China at the United Nations or the Security Council, then this statement is completely inconsistent with the facts and is hypocritical. This violates a basic fact of the United Nations policy."

    Nehru said: "Some major powers have unanimously agreed that the issue of China's participation in the United Nations should not be considered this year or during this session of the General Assembly, that's probably the meaning." Nehru said: "But, in my opinion, this approach is to perpetuate what is obviously wrong for a long time, and to build the entire edifice on a very unnatural foundation; then, if things go wrong later, someone will complain."

### 尼赫鲁主张应当有中立国参加政治会议  并指出我国应取得在联合国中的代表权

    尼赫鲁主张应当有中立国参加政治会议
    并指出我国应取得在联合国中的代表权
    【新华社新德里十八日电】印度总理尼赫鲁九月十七日在印度国会人民院发表了演说。
    尼赫鲁总理在演说中谈到朝鲜政治会议说：“现在，联合国即将讨论这些问题，我知道中国人民政府在对联合国建议的答复中已提出了某些反建议。首先，应当记住，各方都同意了要举行朝鲜政治会议，并在那里执行朝鲜停战和试图解决问题。他们一致同意了政治会议的任务。大家还在考虑着或争辩着的唯一问题，就是这个会议的组成成份。还应当记住，这种会议是不能由多数票来作出决定的。它不能这样来作出决定——显然不能。它将多少要由大多数有关方面的一致意见和协议来作出决定，如果不是全体一致的话。这方面多一些或那方面多一些，是没有什么关系的，除非说参加的国家越多，那就可能更难进行工作；此外，没有特别的困难。”
    尼赫鲁总理说：“目前真正问题是，是否应当有中立国参加这个会议。我们的意见是，如果有这类国家参加是有益于事的，就是因为它们有时能够调和分歧与缓和紧张情势。真正的协议自然必须要靠其他方面之间达成。中立国将不致带来协议，它只是协助造成某种足以导使其他国家达成协议的气氛。”
    尼赫鲁说：朝鲜问题是亚洲的问题。他说：
    “亚洲各国不愿被忽视，不愿被撇在一边，当然不愿被责骂。”
    尼赫鲁谈到联合国大会政治委员会就印度参加朝鲜政治会议问题进行表决的结果说：这次表决得出了某些有趣的结果。“有二十一票反对印度，其中十八票是美洲投的票，而十八票中有十七票是所谓拉丁美洲投的票。我是很尊重拉丁美洲的国家的。这是毫无疑问的。但是事实表明：当几乎所有的欧洲国家和几乎所有的亚洲国家都需要政治会议中有一种东西时，而整个美洲的许多国家却不要这种东西。固然它们有充分的权利不要这种东西，正如他们也有充分的权利要这种东西一样。但是，我们所考虑的是亚洲问题，是亚洲的问题。由于某些对这一问题没有什么关系的人的确不像亚洲人那么关切，是不是亚洲的意志就可以被藐视呢，是不是亚洲和欧洲的联合意志可以被藐视呢？这是一个非常特殊的情况。”
    尼赫鲁总理谈到中华人民共和国在联合国中的代表权问题说：“在过去一些时候以来，摆在联合国面前的问题之一就是是否应接纳中华人民共和国为联合国的会员国。人们谈到允许中国加入联合国的问题时，一直对这个问题存在着某些混乱的想法。这不是什么允许中国参加联合国的问题；中国是联合国的五个发起国之一。唯一足以引起争论的问题是：谁代表中国？任何人能说目前的台湾政府能代表中国么？事实上，台湾提出的任何保证能够在中国实行么？显然是不能的。他们不能代表中国提出保证。因此，如果说，由某些不能够代表中国发言的人，不能够在中国有任何作为的人，不能够对中国有任何影响的人，而充其量只能够表示激烈反对中国的人，来代表中国出席联合国或安全理事会，那么，这种说法是完全不合乎事实的和虚伪的。这是违背联合国政策的一个基本事实。”
    尼赫鲁说：“某些大国已一致认为，不应该在本年内或在本届大会期间考虑中国参加联合国的问题，大概的意思就是这样”。尼赫鲁说：“但是，在我看来这种办法是要把显然错误的事情长期保持下去，而且要把整个的楼阁建筑在极不自然的基础上；那么，假如以后事情弄糟了，那就有人抱怨了。”
