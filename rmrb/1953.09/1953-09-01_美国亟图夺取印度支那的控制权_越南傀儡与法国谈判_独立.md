Xinhua News Agency, August 31st dispatch from Paris: According to TASS, Paris, 30th, the Vietnamese puppet "Emperor" Bao Dai, French President Vincent Auriol, and certain French ministers are conducting negotiations in Rambouillet (Auriol's summer villa).

French newspapers emphasize that it is an open secret that the Americans have been instigating Bao Dai and Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk to demand "full independence" from France, and that U.S. imperialism intends to use this "independence" as a cover to seize these countries.

According to "Le Monde," the negotiations with Bao Dai will proceed in two stages: the negotiations that Bao Dai and Prime Minister Nguyen Van Tam began in Paris after arriving in France will "define the relationship between France and Vietnam within the French Union"; the negotiations in Saigon will address the issue of "transferring powers still held by France to the member states of the Federation."

According to newspaper reports, Bao Dai questioned the current form of his relationship with France, stating that this relationship should be built on a "freely chosen union, determined through negotiations between both parties."

Bao Dai demanded a significant expansion of his overseas diplomatic representation. "Le Monde" believes that this demand would not encounter serious opposition from the French side. He also demanded the power to command the army, on which, "the positions of France and Vietnam are quite likely to conflict." The French government is not so much worried about Bao Dai's demand to command the army as it is about the possibility that he might directly negotiate military "aid" with the United States in the future. French officials are fully aware that in this case, U.S. imperialism would deal a fatal blow to France's position in Indochina. "Le Monde" said, "The main problem at present is the method of negotiating foreign aid (regarding American aid). There is no doubt that Bao Dai, encouraged by certain individuals in the United States and by repeated debates in the U.S. Congress, will demand the power to conduct direct negotiations with the Washington government… These demands will obviously be opposed by many French ministers, especially René Pleven."

Reports also indicate that negotiations between France and Cambodia are currently underway in Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital. The issues being negotiated concern the transfer of judicial power and the police department to the Cambodian authorities. However, the Cambodian delegation also demanded full power in military affairs. The Cambodian delegation stated that France should transfer all Cambodian troops currently under the command of the French army, along with their weapons and provisions, to the Cambodian government. "France-Soir" reported in a panic that the Cambodian delegation demanded the immediate and complete withdrawal of French troops from Cambodia.

### 美国亟图夺取印度支那的控制权  越南傀儡与法国谈判“独立”

    美国亟图夺取印度支那的控制权
    越南傀儡与法国谈判“独立”
    【新华社三十一日讯】据塔斯社巴黎三十日讯：越南傀儡“皇帝”保大和法国总统阿里奥尔以及某些法国部长正在郎布依埃（阿里奥尔的消夏别墅）进行谈判。
    法国报纸着重指出，美国人一直在唆使保大和高棉国王诺鲁东·西哈努克向法国要求“充分的独立”，而美帝国主义正想把这种“独立”利用来作为夺取这些国家的掩盖，这已经是公开的秘密了。
    据“世界报”说，和保大进行的谈判将分两方面进行：保大和总理阮文心到达法国后在巴黎开始进行的谈判，将“确定法国与越南在法兰西联邦中的关系”；在西贡进行的谈判，将处理关于“把仍然由法国掌握的权力移交给联邦成员国”的问题。
    据报纸消息，保大对他和法国的关系的目前形式提出疑问，他说，这种关系应当建筑在一种“自由选择的联合的基础上，经由双方谈判加以确定”。
    保大要求大大扩充他的驻在海外的外交代表，“世界报”认为这个要求不致遭到法国方面的严重反对。他还要求统率军队的权力，在这个问题上，
    “法国和越南的立场十分明显地可能发生矛盾”。法国政府所焦虑的并不是保大要求统率军队，而是恐怕将来他可能直接和美国谈判军事“援助”。法国官方人士充分认识到：这样一来，美帝国主义就会给予法国在印度支那的地位以一种致命的打击。“世界报”说，“目前的主要问题是谈判外国援助（关于美国的援助）的方法问题。毫无疑问，保大在美国某些人士和美国国会多次辩论的怂恿下，将要求和华盛顿政府进行直接的谈判的权力……这些要求显然将遭到许多法国部长，尤其是普利文的反对。”
    各报还报道说，法国和高棉之间的谈判目前正在高棉首都金边进行，谈判的问题是关于把司法权移交给高棉当局和警察局的问题。但是高棉代表团还要求在军事方面有充分的权力。高棉代表团说，法国应当把目前属于法军统辖的所有高棉部队连同他们的武器和给养一起移交给高棉政府。“法兰西晚报”惊惶失措地说，高棉代表团要求法军立即全部退出高棉。
