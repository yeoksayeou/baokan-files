American air force personnel Frank H. Schwable and 24 others participated in large-scale bacteriological warfare conducted by the U.S. military in North Korea during the Korean War, and their crimes are serious, and they should be punished according to the law. The General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, considering that they were all carrying out orders from their superiors and are not the main persons responsible for planning and launching bacteriological warfare against us, and that they were able to confess their crimes after committing them, has decided to grant them lenient treatment in accordance with the lenient policy of our People's Army, and issued an order on September 1, exempting them all from prosecution.
