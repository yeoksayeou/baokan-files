In Certain Grassroots Stores and Cooperatives in Sichuan Province
Out-of-Stock Phenomena Occur Continuously Before and After the Autumn Harvest

    In counties such as Dayi, Fuling, and Fengjie in Sichuan Province, and in certain supply and marketing cooperatives in counties such as Longchang and Luxian, out-of-stock phenomena occurred continuously in department stores and cooperatives before and after the autumn harvest. In Dayi Department Store, cotton yarn was out of stock for fifteen days, affecting the production of urban hand-weaving industries and rural sideline production. The store's sales volume decreased by 280 million yuan due to several commodities being out of stock in early August. The Longchang County United Cooperative and various district supply and marketing cooperatives generally paid more attention to the supply work during the autumn harvest. They conducted surveys in rural areas in advance, and the County United Cooperative led the district supply and marketing cooperatives to revise and increase the supply plan twice. The supply plan for the third quarter of the county's supply and marketing cooperatives increased by about 40 percent on average compared to the second quarter. The actual reserves of agricultural tools and non-staple foods needed by farmers during the autumn harvest also exceeded the planned amount. However, after the autumn harvest began, farmers' purchasing power greatly increased, and almost everything that was prepared was insufficient. Cooperative cadres rushed to replenish goods temporarily. For example, the County United Cooperative originally planned to supply more than 4,000 sickles, but they were sold out soon after the autumn harvest began. The cooperative's own sickle processing factory worked day and night to produce them, but it was still too late. Even a batch of sickles that had been stockpiled in the past with specifications that did not meet the local farmers' habits were sold out. The sales volume of other agricultural tools such as bamboo baskets, basket ropes, and large brooms, as well as non-staple foods such as vermicelli and noodles, also greatly exceeded expectations. After some agricultural tools were out of stock in the cooperatives, some speculative private merchants raised market prices. The prices of some agricultural tools even increased by 30 to 50 percent. The reason for the sharp increase in rural purchasing power is that the province's agricultural products generally had a bumper harvest, and the price of new grain was higher than before, so farmers actively sold grain. After selling a batch of early grain, they generally needed to purchase a batch of agricultural tools and non-staple foods for the autumn harvest period. At the same time, this year the Party and the government have further strengthened their leadership over the autumn harvest work, and farmers are striving to seize good weather for harvesting. Some farmers who used to borrow agricultural tools from each other in previous years are now buying their own. In addition, due to the busy autumn harvest, farmers buy daily necessities that they usually purchase sporadically all at once to save time. However, some cooperative cadres lacked a proactive concept of serving rural production and failed to conduct in-depth investigations among farmers, resulting in out-of-stock phenomena. The Preparatory Committee of the Sichuan Provincial Federation of Cooperatives has learned from the lessons of the Longchang Cooperative and notified cooperatives throughout the province, requiring cooperatives at all levels to make the greatest efforts to seize the reserves of necessary means of livelihood and means of production for farmers after the autumn harvest to avoid the recurrence of out-of-stock phenomena.

    四川省某些基层商店和合作社
    秋收前后不断发生商品脱销现象
    四川省大邑、涪陵、奉节等县的百货商店和隆昌、泸县等县的某些供销合作社，在秋收前后，曾不断发生商品脱销的现象。大邑百货商店的棉纱脱销十五天，影响了城市手工织布业和农村副业的生产。该店因八月上旬有数种商品脱销，销货额即减少二亿八千万元。隆昌县联社及各区供销社对秋收期间的供应工作，一般还是比较重视的。他们事先向农村作了调查，县联社曾领导各区供销社两次修订并增大了供销计划，全县各供销社第三季度的供应计划平均比第二季度增大了约百分之四十。对农民在秋收中所需要的农具和副食品的实际储备量还超过了计划数。但到秋收开始后，农民的购买力大大提高，原来准备的东西几乎样样不足，合作社干部临时手忙脚乱去添货。如县联社原计划供应镰刀四千多把，秋收开始不久就卖完了，合作社自己办的镰刀加工工厂日夜赶制都来不及，连过去积存的规格不合当地农民习惯要求的一批镰刀也卖光了。其他如箩筐、箩绳、大扫把等农具，粉条、挂面等副食品的销售量均大大超过预计。合作社某些农具脱销后，一些投机私商就抬高市价，有的农具价格竟上涨百分之三十到五十。农村购买力所以急剧上升，是因为全省农产品普遍丰收，新粮粮价又较前提高，农民售粮踊跃；在售出一批早粮后，一般都要购置一批秋收期用的农具和副食品。同时今年党和政府都更进一步加强了对秋收工作的领导，农民都争取好天进行抢收，有些农民往年互借农具，今年都自己添购；再加秋收繁忙，农民为节省时间，把平时零星购买的生活用品集中一次都买了。但某些合作社干部因缺乏积极为农村生产服务的观念，不向农民进行深入调查，因而发生脱销现象。现四川省联社筹备委员会已吸取隆昌合作社的教训，通报全省合作社，要求各级合作社以最大的努力来抓紧储备秋后农民必需的生活资料与生产资料，以免再发生脱销现象。　　　　　（林沫、史明照）
