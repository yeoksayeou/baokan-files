Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 13th: The Soviet magazine "Communist" published an article by P. Nikitin in its tenth issue, discussing the significant achievements of Soviet machine manufacturing.

Nikitin wrote: Machine manufacturing is the center of gravity of heavy industry and the most important sector in the Soviet national economy. Soviet machine manufacturing is developing at an amazing speed. At the end of the Fourth Five-Year Plan, the proportion of Soviet machine manufacturing in large-scale industrial production accounted for about 40 percent. Such a high level is beyond the reach of even the most industrially advanced capitalist countries. The machines and equipment produced in 1952 alone greatly exceeded the total produced during the First and Second Five-Year Plans. During the pre-war Five-Year Plans, and especially in the post-war period, tremendous changes have taken place in Soviet machine manufacturing. Advanced production methods such as die-casting, automatic welding, electric heating, and high-speed metal cutting have been applied in our enterprises, and continuous production equipment, linked machine tools, and the electrification, automation, and remote control of production processes have been widely adopted. As early as 1950, the total output of Soviet machine manufacturing and metal processing exceeded the 1940 level by 1.3 times. The production of metallurgical equipment increased correspondingly by 3.8 times, electrical equipment and oil production equipment by 2 times, steam turbine output by 1.6 times, tractors by 2.8 times, and combines by 2.6 times. Moreover, and more importantly, all sectors of Soviet machine manufacturing have fundamentally and completely improved the production of machines and equipment in accordance with modern technological standards. In the last three years alone, more than 1,500 new types of machines and equipment have been produced.

Nikitin then wrote: Machine tool manufacturing is a leading and important link in machine manufacturing. Soviet machine tool manufacturing workers have achieved significant success in this area. During the first post-war Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union was able to produce about 250 new types of metal-cutting machine tools for various purposes, more than 1,000 types of special lathes and linked lathes, 23 types of automatic and semi-automatic machine tools, 34 types of automatic forging presses, and 26 types of automatic continuous production equipment. Compared with the pre-war period, the production of various highly accurate lathes has increased by more than 3 times, large and heavy lathes by 5 times, and special lathes and linked lathes by 11 times. At the end of the Fourth Five-Year Plan, the total number of metal-cutting machine tools had doubled compared to 1940. Moreover, the labor productivity of these lathes has also increased by 50 to 100 percent compared to the pre-war period. Now, all sectors of Soviet machine manufacturing, especially the automobile, tractor, and aviation industries, as well as working machine and transport machine manufacturing, are equipped with the most modern and highly productive lathes and forging equipment. Soviet machine manufacturing factories can now manufacture all machines.

Soviet machine manufacturing has produced many machines to mechanize laborious work in various sectors of the national economy. In the first post-war Five-Year Plan alone, more than 220 new machines of this type were successively produced in large quantities. For example, before the Great Patriotic War, the Soviet coal mining industry did not have coal loading machines and ore transporting machines. In recent years, Soviet designers have designed more than 130 new machines for the coal mining industry. In 1952, the level of mechanization of the most laborious operation in coal mining – coal loading – reached almost 25 percent, and in the Kuznetsk and Karaganda coal regions, it reached 50 percent. In terms of agricultural mechanization, the Soviet Union has also manufactured more and more new machines. In 1940, Soviet machine manufacturing produced 84 types of agricultural machines and tools, and at the end of the Fourth Five-Year Plan, it could manufacture 222 types. During the Fourth Five-Year Plan, Soviet industry manufactured a total of 536,000 tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower), 93,000 grain combines, and other highly productive agricultural machines for agriculture. In 1952, almost all cultivated land in Soviet collective farms was tilled by tractors, more than 80 percent of the sowing work was mechanized, and 70 percent of the total grain area was harvested by combines.

Nikitin wrote: Our motherland is steadfastly following the path of socialist industrialization. The Soviet people constantly care about the development of heavy industry, especially machine manufacturing, and have therefore achieved unprecedented upsurges in various sectors of the national economy, built a socialist society, and created the conditions to ensure a smooth transition to communist society.

    苏联机器制造业获得重大成就
    在大工业生产中的比重超过所有资本主义国家
   【新华社十三日讯】莫斯科消息：苏联“共产党人”杂志第十期登载了普·尼克金的一篇文章，论述苏联机器制造业的重大成就。
    尼克金写道：机器制造业是重工业的重心，它是苏联国民经济中最重要的部门。苏联机器制造业以惊人的速度发展着。在第四个五年计划结束时，苏联机器制造业在大工业生产中的比重已占百分之四十左右，这样高的水平甚至工业最先进的资本主义国家都望尘莫及。单是一九五二年生产的机器和装置，就大大超过了第一个和第二个五年计划期间生产的总和。在战前几个五年计划期间，特别是在战后时期中，苏联机器制造业发生了巨大的变化。在我们的企业中，应用了像压铸、自动焊接、电力加热、高速金属切削等先进的生产方法，并广泛采用了连续生产装置、联动机床以及生产过程的电气化、自动化和远距离操纵。早在一九五○年，苏联机器制造和金属加工的生产总量，就超过一九四○年的水平一点三倍，冶金设备的生产相应地增加了三点八倍，电气设备与石油生产设备增加了两倍，蒸汽透平的产量增加了一点六倍，拖拉机二点八倍、联合机二点六倍。而且，更重要的是苏联机器制造业的一切部门，基本上已完全按照现代技术水平改善了机器和设备的生产。仅在最近三年中，就生产了一千五百多种新型的机器和设备。
    尼克金接着写道：母机制造业是机器制造业中起主导作用的重要环节。苏联母机制造工人在这一方面已取得了重大的成就。在战后第一个五年计划期间，苏联已能够生产二百五十种左右的供各种用途的新型金属切削母机，一千多种特种车床和联动车床，二十三种自动和半自动机床，三十四种自动锻压机，二十六种自动连续生产装置。与战前比较，各种高度准确性的车床的生产增加了三倍多，大型和重型车床增加了五倍，特种车床和联动车床增加了十一倍。在第四个五年计划结束时，金属切削母机的总数较一九四○年增加了一倍。而且，这些车床的劳动生产率还比战前提高一半到一倍。现在，苏联机器制造业的一切部门、特别是汽车、拖拉机、航空工业，工作母机和运输机器制造业，都装备了最现代化的、生产力很高的车床和锻压设备，苏联的机器制造工厂已可以制造一切机器。
    苏联机器制造业制造了许多机器，使国民经济各个部门的费力工作机械化。单是在战后第一个五年计划期间，就先后大量生产二百二十多种这样的新机器。例如，卫国战争以前，苏联采煤工业中还没有装煤机和矿石装运机，而在最近几年中，苏联设计师就为采煤工业设计了一百三十多种新机器。在一九五二年，采煤业最费力的操作——装煤工作的机械化水平几乎达到了百分之二十五，而在库兹涅茨克和卡拉干达煤区则达到了百分之五十。在使农业机械化方面，苏联也制造了愈来愈多的新机器。一九四零年，苏联机器制造业生产了八十四种农业机器和工具，而第四个五年计划结束时，已可以制造二百二十二种了。在第四个五年计划期间，苏联工业共为农业制造了五十三万六千台拖拉机
  （每台以十五匹马力计算），九万三千台谷物联合机和其他生产力很高的农业机器。一九五二年，苏联集体农庄的耕地几乎全部都用拖拉机耕田，百分之八十以上的播种工作已机械化了，占谷物总面积百分之七十的谷物是用联合机收割的。
    尼克金写道：我们祖国坚定不移地遵循着社会主义工业化的道路前进。苏联人民经常关心着重工业特别是机器制造业的发展，因而获得了国民经济各部门的空前高涨，建设了社会主义社会，同时创造了保证向共产主义社会顺利前进的条件。
