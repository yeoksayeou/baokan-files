    A Village on the Banks of the Ili River
    By our reporter Zhu Bo

    On the north bank of the Ili River lies a village of nearly 400 households, known as Turpan Uiz in Ining County. The residents are all of the Uyghur ethnic group.

    Turpan Uiz is nominally a village, but it resembles a small county town. A wide street, four li long, runs through the entire village. Rows of poplars and weeping willows line both sides of the street. In the shade of the trees, there's the sound of trickling water. Almost every family here has an orchard, where famous red apples, white apples, pear fruits, grapes and other fruit trees are grown. The village is surrounded by many wild apricot trees, and in autumn, the ground is covered with yellow apricots. If you were to come here in the spring when the fruit trees are in bloom, you would certainly think this is a beautiful garden, and not feel that it is an ordinary farm village on the banks of the Ili River.

    In July, when farmers in other regions are busy weeding, the Uyghur farmers here have already begun their intensive autumn harvest. Men and women farmers are everywhere in the fields harvesting wheat and oats, and horse-drawn carts loaded with watermelons are speeding along the roads, stirring up clouds of dust. The village itself is quiet, as almost everyone has gone to the fields. Hamirdin, the chairman of the Turpan Uiz Farmers' Association, said, "In previous years, you wouldn't have found it so quiet here. Many people would be sitting under the fruit trees with their 'dutars' [a Uyghur musical instrument], singing and dancing, working in the fields for only two or three hours a day. As a result, the autumn harvest often dragged on until it snowed. This year is different. The District People's Government has called on us to harvest quickly. The whole village has proposed to finish the autumn harvest before the end of October." Usman Uiz, who is over sixty years old, said, "The wheat is growing so well this year! My family planted two and a half *hu* [a unit of dry measure] more wheat [1] and half a *hu* of watermelons than last year. If we don't hurry up with the harvest, the heavy snow will bury the wheat in the ground."

    This year, the farmers of Turpan Uiz have generally expanded the area of cultivated land. The area sown to wheat alone is more than two hundred *hu* greater than last year. The planting of watermelons and oats is also the same. Many farmers have adopted new varieties and new cultivation methods. According to experienced Uyghur farmers, a bumper harvest this year is assured. Subar, who is seventy-one years old, planted two *hu* more wheat than last year. He compared the wheat he planted this year with the wheat he had left over from last year. This year's wheat has an average of more than sixty grains per ear, while last year's wheat had an average of less than fifty grains per ear. Last year's watermelon plants averaged less than two watermelons each, while this year's averaged four watermelons each.

    In the fields, we met Mahamoti, the labor model of the Ili region, who was leading the members of the agricultural production cooperative in harvesting oats. During a break, he told me about the establishment of this cooperative. He said that the agricultural production cooperative was established last winter. In the past, a work team had organized a large-scale agricultural production cooperative in this village, but because the principle of voluntarism was not followed, it collapsed after only one year. Soon after, some farmers voluntarily came together and asked to reorganize a small cooperative. Thus, the agricultural production cooperative was organized under the leadership of Mahamoti. There are six households participating in the cooperative, and they have formulated a charter based on the experiences of other agricultural production cooperatives.

    The Mahamoti Agricultural Production Cooperative quickly gained the praise of the farmers throughout the village. Last winter, they originally planned to apply five hundred cartloads of fertilizer, but they applied seven hundred cartloads. More than sixty-five percent of the land was plowed twice, and some of the land was plowed three times. This was unheard of in the past. As a result, the crops are growing particularly well this year. One *hu* of corn that they test-planted can yield one hundred *hu*. People are often visiting the agricultural production cooperative's land to learn about new cultivation methods.

    The agricultural production cooperative has also test-planted some new varieties. The five-eared wheat (also known as big-head wheat) is growing so well that it has attracted many farmers, who are asking the cooperative to exchange seeds of this new wheat variety. Not only is its yield high, the wheat grains have thin skins and a lot of flour, but it is also drought-resistant and wind-resistant.

    Mahamoti said: "Our cooperative was established not long ago, and the public property is not yet much. Now we have only added two new foreign plows and a horse. It will be better by this time next year." The cooperative plans to purchase a complete set of farm implements after the autumn harvest this year, repair the houses of the members, and plans to cultivate an orchard.

    The autumn harvest is so busy that the farmers can only use the early mornings and evenings to build new houses. Now, a new street has been extended from the middle of the village to the north, and new houses are being built one after another on both sides of the street. According to township head Amati Hadi, "In the past, the only requirement of the Uyghur compatriots was to have 'nang' [a type of flatbread] [2] to eat and clothes to wear; now it is different. The problems of eating and clothing have been largely solved, and everyone is thinking about housing. More than thirty households in the village have already built new houses, and dozens of other households have already prepared wood and adobe bricks and will be able to start construction soon. People are always like this, because everyone wants to make their lives better."

    When we visited the farmer Tair Baik, he had gone to the fields to cut wheat. His wife, Ziwalamu, was tidying up their newly completed five-room house. Her twelve-year-old daughter was standing on a stool cleaning the glass windows. Ziwalamu said, "Because the house has just been built, it is very damp inside. Otherwise, we could entertain guests in our new house." Tair Baik is a poor farmer who used to live in a dilapidated house that had to be repaired countless times every year. This year is a bumper harvest, and he plans to buy a milch cow, a horse, and a large cart.

    Ayup, who is fifty-two years old, has been a hired laborer for more than thirty years. In the past, his family of six lived in a broken cellar, and the wages he earned each year were only enough to eat "nang". Since liberation, his life has undergone great changes. After last year's bumper harvest, he bought two milch cows. Although Ayup's wife has her beloved milch cows, she is still not satisfied. When she saw that others were building new houses, she argued with Ayup that they should also build a new house. Ayup said: "I also want to build a new house, but then I would have to sell the milch cows." When she heard that he wanted to sell the milch cows to build a new house, she didn't want to anymore. She said:

    "Now, when I say I want to build a new house, you are shouting about selling my milch cows. You, you just don't know how to plan and live your life!" Ayup said with a smile:

    "You silly woman, do you think I'm not as smart as you, not as good as you at living your life? Let me tell you, I have already ordered the wood, and we will build a new house after the autumn harvest, and even build a new house for your two precious milch cows!"

    When the moon hangs high in the night sky, the sound of wheat grains rubbing against wooden shovels can be heard everywhere in the fields around Turpan Uiz. The Uyghur compatriots who have been working all day are working again under the moonlight to thresh the wheat.

    [1] One *hu* is more than one hundred and ten *jin* [a unit of weight, approximately 500 grams]. One *hu* of land is the area occupied by one *hu* of seeds.
    [2] "Nang" is baked from wheat flour and is the main food of the Uyghur compatriots. (Attached picture)

### 伊犁河畔的一村

    伊犁河畔的一村
    本报记者  朱波
    在伊犁河的北岸，有一个将近四百多户的村庄，这就是伊宁县的吐鲁番圩孜。在这里居住的都是维吾尔族的同胞。
    吐鲁番圩孜名义上是一个村庄，可是看上去它好像一座县城，长达四里的宽宽的街道横贯着全村。街道的两旁长着成排的白杨树和垂柳。树荫深处是潺潺的流水。这里，几乎家家都有果子园，园里种着著名的红苹果、白苹果、梨木果子、葡萄等果树。村子的四围长着很多野杏树，一到秋天，满地上是黄色的杏子。如果你在春天果树开花的季节来到这里，一定会认为这是一座美丽的花园，而感觉不到这是伊犁河畔的一个普通农庄。
    七月，当其它地区的农民正忙于锄草的时候，这里的维族农民已开始紧张的秋收工作。地里到处是收割小麦、燕麦的男女农民，道路上奔驰着装满西瓜的马车，扬起一团一团的尘土。村子里却是静悄悄的，差不多人们都到地里去了。吐鲁番圩孜的农会主席哈米而丁说：“往年这时候你来这里，不会感到这样静，很多人都抱着‘都他’，坐在果树下唱歌跳舞，一天只在地里工作二、三个小时，因此，每年的秋收往往要拖到下雪天。今年的情况不同了。区人民政府号召我们快割快打。全村群众提出要在十月底以前结束秋收工作。”六十多岁的乌斯满吾孜提说：“今年的麦子长得多好呀！我家比去年多种了两斛半麦子〔一〕和半斛西瓜，如果不加紧收割，大雪就会把麦子埋在地里。”
    今年，吐鲁番圩孜的农民，普遍扩大了耕田面积，仅小麦一项，就比去年多种了二百多斛；西瓜、燕麦的种植同样如此。许多农家采用了新的品种和新的耕作方法。据有经验的维族农民说，今年的大丰收是有把握的。七十一岁的苏巴尔老人，今年比去年多种了两斛麦子。他曾把自己种的小麦和去年留下来的小麦作了一个对比，今年的小麦，平均每穗有六十个以上的麦粒，而去年的小麦平均每穗不到五十个麦粒；去年种的西瓜每棵平均不到两个西瓜，今年每棵平均有四个西瓜。
    我们在地里见到了伊犁区的劳动模范麻合莫提，他正领导着农业生产合作社的社员们收割燕麦。休息时，他对我叙述了这个合作社的成立经过。他说，农业生产合作社是在去年冬季成立的。过去，工作队曾经在这个村子里组织了一个大型的农业生产合作社，但由于没有贯彻自愿的原则，只坚持一年就垮台了。不久，有些农民自愿地结合在一起，要求重新组织一个小型合作社。这样，农业生产合作社就在麻哈莫提领导下组织起来了。参加合作社的共有六户，他们参照其它农业生产合作社的经验，制订了章程。
    麻合莫提农业生产合作社很快就得到全村农民的赞誉。去年冬季，他们原计划施五百车肥料，结果施了七百车。百分之六十五以上的土地犁了两遍，有一部分土地犁了三遍。这种情况在过去是没有的。因此，今年的庄稼长得特别好。他们试种的一斛包谷可以收到一百斛。在农业生产合作社的地里，经常有人在参观，打听新的耕作方法。
    农业生产合作社还试种了一些新的品种。五穗麦（又名大头麦）长得那末茁壮，竟把很多农民吸引住了，他们要求社里交换这种新麦种。它的收获量不仅大，麦粒皮薄面多，而且能抗旱抗风。
    麻合莫提说：“我们的合作社成立不久，公共财产还不多，现在只新添两张洋犁和一匹马，到明年这时候就好了。”社里计划今年秋收后添置一全套农具，整修社员的房子，并计划培植一个果园。
    秋收如此紧张，农民只能利用一早半晚的时间来修建新居。现在，从村中间向北又伸展了一条新的街道，街道两旁一座一座的新房子都开始修建起来了。据乡长阿麦提哈迪而说：“过去维族同胞唯一的要求是有‘馕’〔二〕吃、有衣穿；现在不同了，吃、穿问题大体上已经解决了，都想到住的问题。全村已有三十多户建筑了新房子，另有几十户已经把木料、土坯准备好了，不久就可以动工。人总是这样的，因为谁也愿意把生活搞得更美好。”
    我们访问农民塔依尔拜克的时候，他到地里割麦子去了。他的女人孜瓦拉木正在整理刚落成的五间新房子。她的十二岁的女儿站在凳子上擦着玻璃窗。孜瓦拉木说：“房子因为刚刚修好，里面很潮湿，要不，我们可以在新房子里招待客人。”塔依尔拜克是一个贫苦的农民，过去住在一间残破的房子里，一年不知要修理多少次。今年是丰收，他准备买一头乳牛、一匹马和一挂大车。
    五十二岁的阿玉普是一个三十多年的雇工。过去，他一家六口人挤在一间破地窖里，每年挣的工资只够吃“馕”。解放后，他的生活有了大的变化。去年丰收后他买了两头乳牛。阿玉普的女人虽然有了心爱的乳牛，还表示不满足。她看到别人都盖新房子的时候，和阿玉普吵着也要盖新房子。阿玉普说：“我也愿意盖新房子，那就得把乳牛卖掉。”她听说要卖乳牛盖新房，就又不愿意了。她说：
    “现在，我说要盖新房，你却嚷着要卖我的乳牛，你呀，你就不会算计着过生活！”阿玉普笑着说：
    “你这个傻女人，难道我不如你聪明，不如你会过生活吗？告诉你，我已经订买了木料，秋收后就盖新房，而且还为你那两只宝贝乳牛盖一间新房哩！”
    当月亮高悬在夜空里的时候，吐鲁番圩孜周围的野地里，到处传出麦粒擦着木锨的“沙沙”声。劳动了一天的维族同胞，又在月光下进行打麦工作了。
    〔一〕一斛是一百一十多斤。一斛地是一斛种籽所占的面积。
    〔二〕“馕”用麦子面烤成，是维族同胞的主要食品。（附图片）
    爷爷对孙女说：“看，今年的果子长得多么大呀！”
