Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 1st: On September 1st, our side repatriated 150 non-Korean POWs and 250 Korean POWs to the other side.

The other side repatriated 2,395 captured personnel of the Korean People's Army to our side.

This morning, as the returning personnel of our side sang songs while passing over Panmunjom Bridge, a Rhee Syngman army officer actually threw a can at them, hitting a captured soldier named Kim Kyung-han in the forehead, causing him to bleed profusely. Our duty officer lodged a protest with the other side's duty officer regarding this.

Today at 11:00 AM, as the returning personnel of our side stepped off the American repatriation vehicles and angrily threw away the clothes and items given to them by the American side, an American lieutenant colonel directed an American driver operating American repatriation vehicle number 41187479 to kick Kim Ji-ryong, a returning member of our side. This is the third time since the exchange of prisoners of war that American military personnel have abused returning personnel of our side within our handover zone. Our military police immediately detained the offending American driver, and our administrative officer lodged a protest with the other side. After the other side's administrative officer admitted their mistake and apologized, we released the American driver.

Today, among the returning captured personnel of the Korean People's Army, 14 more people were stabbed with bayonets and injured by stones thrown by the American military for singing and shouting slogans en route from Munsan to Panmunjom. Korean People's Army soldier Li Zhenghe returned with blood streaming from his forehead, and he brought back a fist-sized stone thrown by the American military and handed it to our staff as evidence of the American side's harm to prisoners of war.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 4th: On September 4th, our side repatriated 100 non-Korean POWs and 200 Korean POWs to the other side, totaling 300. Among the non-Korean POWs were 95 Americans and 5 Britons.

At approximately 9:00 AM today, an American medium-sized jeep returning from our handover zone threw rotten shoes at our jeep carrying our repatriation liaison officers returning from the other side's handover zone near Panmunjom Bridge. The duty officer of our handover zone lodged a protest with the other side's duty officer regarding this incident.
