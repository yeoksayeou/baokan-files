Xinhua News Agency, Dihua, 10th: The CCP Central Committee Xinjiang Bureau convened the Xinjiang Province Pastoral Work Conference in July, reviewing the pastoral work and the implementation of various policies, and discussing how to further strengthen the pastoral work and other issues.

At the meeting, Bao Erhan, Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government, conveyed the spirit of the Third (Enlarged) Meeting of the Central People's Government's Nationalities Affairs Commission on the basic summary report of animal husbandry production in some pastoral areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Suiyuan, Qinghai, and Xinjiang. Zhang Bangying, Third Secretary of the CCP Central Committee Xinjiang Bureau, gave a report on pastoral work in Xinjiang. In his report, Zhang Bangying pointed out the characteristics of the pastoral areas in Xinjiang, summarized the pastoral work in Xinjiang Province over the past three years, and proposed the guidelines, tasks, and solutions to many specific problems for future pastoral work.

The meeting believed that since the Second Party Congress of Xinjiang Province in July last year, due to the implementation of the policies and guidelines of the CCP Central Committee and the CCP Central Committee Northwest Bureau on pastoral work by party committees and people's governments at all levels, the pastoral work has achieved remarkable results. At present, the social order in Xinjiang's pastoral areas has been stabilized, and the confidence of herdsmen of all ethnic groups in developing animal husbandry has been generally enhanced. Some herdowners have taken out the gold and silver ingots that have been buried underground for many years to buy sheep. In many areas, herdsmen have voluntarily signed patriotic agreements to increase and protect livestock, and have begun to improve the feeding management of livestock and cultivate grasslands. The wolf-hunting campaign has been universally launched in pastoral areas, thus enabling the development of animal husbandry production in Xinjiang. The number of various livestock has increased by 10 to 15 percent compared with last year, and the lives of herdsmen have also improved compared with before.

In order to further develop the animal husbandry industry in Xinjiang Province, the meeting also criticized the currently widespread tendency among many cadres of attaching importance to agriculture and neglecting animal husbandry, and criticized the tendency of many leading organs and cadres not understanding or even neglecting the situation in pastoral areas and the production and living characteristics of herdsmen. The meeting believed that these ideas and styles are the main obstacles to further implementing the pastoral policies and continuing to advance the pastoral work.

The meeting pointed out that Xinjiang's sheep account for about one-fourth of the country's total, and horses account for nearly one-sixth of the country's total. Xinjiang's animal husbandry economy is an important part of the national animal husbandry economy, and the animal husbandry economy is an indispensable part of the national economy now and in the future. Therefore, the regular central task of Xinjiang's pastoral areas in the future is to develop and prosper the animal husbandry economy.

The meeting determined that in the future, the principle of prudence and stability should continue to be implemented in pastoral areas, the united front work should be strengthened, the social order in pastoral areas should be further consolidated, animal husbandry should be protected and developed, and the lives of people in pastoral areas should be gradually improved. According to this principle and the current actual situation in pastoral areas, the meeting determined that the specific tasks of Xinjiang's pastoral areas in the future are: 1. To greatly increase livestock and improve livestock quality. Within the next year, the task of increasing livestock by 15 percent on the basis of the existing livestock should be completed; 2. To strengthen trade work in pastoral areas and fully supply the necessities for the production and life of herdsmen; 3. To further strengthen the construction of political power and the united front work in pastoral areas; 4. To improve the political and cultural level of the people in pastoral areas and carry out health work.

The meeting also resolved many specific policy issues in pastoral work. The meeting determined that disputes over pastures and grasslands must be mediated on the basis of protecting the ownership of private, tribal, and temple pastures and grasslands; pastures should be protected in pastoral and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, and reclamation should be prohibited and restricted; the policy of benefiting both herdsmen and herdowners should continue to be implemented, and herder wages should be appropriately adjusted according to the actual conditions of pastoral areas in various places. Regarding mutual aid and cooperation organizations in animal husbandry, they are not yet advocated under the current conditions in Xinjiang. The mutual aid groups spontaneously organized by herdsmen should be rectified according to the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit. In order to enable herdsmen of all ethnic groups to better recuperate and multiply, the policy of light taxation must continue to be implemented and the tax collection methods must be improved. The meeting also determined that land reform will not be carried out in semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas.

Responsible cadres from party and government organizations in pastoral and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, as well as leading cadres from provincial-level trade, cooperative, health, education, animal husbandry, and other agencies attended the meeting. Sun Zuobin, Deputy Minister of the United Front Work Department of the CCP Central Committee Northwest Bureau, and Saifuddin, Fourth Secretary of the CCP Central Committee Xinjiang Bureau, gave important instructions to the meeting.

    中共中央新疆分局召开牧区工作会议
    确定以发展和繁荣畜牧业经济为中心任务
    【新华社迪化十日电】中共中央新疆分局在七月间召开新疆省牧区工作会议，检查了牧区工作及各项政策的执行情况，讨论了如何进一步加强牧区工作等问题。
    会上，新疆省人民政府主席鲍尔汉传达了中央人民政府民族事务委员会第三次（扩大）会议关于内蒙古自治区及绥远、青海、新疆等地若干牧业区畜牧业生产的基本总结报告的精神，中共中央新疆分局第三书记张邦英作了关于新疆牧区工作的报告。张邦英在报告中指出了新疆牧区的特点，总结了新疆省三年来的牧区工作，并提出了今后牧区工作的方针、任务和许多具体问题的解决办法。
    会议认为：自去年七月新疆省第二届党代表会议以后，由于各级党委和人民政府贯彻了中共中央和中共中央西北局对牧区工作的政策方针，使牧区工作获得显著成绩，目前新疆牧区社会秩序已经安定，各族牧民发展畜牧业的信心普遍提高，有些牧主把多年埋在地下的黄金、元宝都拿出来买了羊，许多地区的牧民自动订立了爱国增畜保畜公约，开始改善牲畜的饲养管理和培育草原；打狼运动已在牧区普遍展开，因而使新疆的畜牧业生产有了发展，各种牲畜比去年增加了百分之十到十五，牧民生活也较前有了改善。
    为了进一步发展新疆省的畜牧事业，会议同时批判了目前许多干部仍普遍存在的重农轻牧思想，批判了不少领导机关和干部不了解甚至忽视牧区情况及牧民生产、生活特点的倾向。会议认为这些思想和作风是当前进一步贯彻牧区政策，把牧区工作继续向前推进的主要障碍。
    会议指出新疆绵羊约占全国四分之一，马占全国近六分之一。新疆畜牧业经济是全国畜牧业经济的重要部分，而畜牧业经济在现在以及将来都是全国国民经济不可缺少的组成部分，因而，今后新疆牧区的经常中心任务就是发展与繁荣畜牧业经济。
    会议确定：今后在牧区应继续贯彻慎重稳进的方针，加强统一战线工作，进一步巩固牧区社会秩序，保护与发展畜牧业，逐步改善牧区人民的生活。根据这个方针和当前牧区的实际情况，会议确定今后新疆牧区的具体任务是：一、大量增殖牲畜，提高牲畜质量，在今后一年内，要在原有牲畜的基础上完成增殖牲畜百分之十五的任务；二、加强牧区贸易工作，充分供应牧民生产和生活必需品；三、进一步加强牧区的政权建设工作和统一战线工作；四、提高牧区人民的政治、文化水平，开展卫生工作。
    会议并解决了在牧区工作中的许多具体政策问题。会议确定必须在保护私人、部落、寺庙的牧场、草场所有权的基础上，调处牧场、草场纠纷；在牧区和半农半牧区应保护牧场，禁止和限制开荒；继续贯彻牧工牧主两利政策，根据各地牧区实际情况，适当地调整牧工工资；关于畜牧业的互助合作组织，在新疆目前的条件下还不提倡，牧民自发组织起来的互助组，应根据自愿互利的原则加以整顿。为使各族牧民更好的休养生息，必须继续贯彻轻税政策和改进征税方法。会议并确定在半农半牧区不进行土地改革。
    出席这次会议的有牧区和半农半牧区的党政负责干部，以及省级贸易、合作、卫生、教育、畜牧等机关的领导干部。中共中央西北局统一战线工作部副部长孙作宾、中共中央新疆分局第四书记赛福鼎都对会议作了重要指示。
