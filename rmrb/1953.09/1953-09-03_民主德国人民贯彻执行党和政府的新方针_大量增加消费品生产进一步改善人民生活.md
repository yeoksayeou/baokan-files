Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 2nd: The German Democratic Republic is implementing the new policies put forward by the Socialist Unity Party and the government in various places to further improve the lives of the working people of Democratic Germany.

According to the decision of the Socialist Unity Party and the government on increasing the production of consumer goods, the food, textile, shoe, daily necessities, and children's toy sectors are all improving and expanding production to meet the needs of the people.

The "Domnitz United Margarine Factory's" production in July was double that of the second quarter. The "Mirka" margarine factory near Weissenberg will increase its production in the third quarter of this year to double that of the first quarter. In addition, the quality of margarine will be improved and a variety of margarines will be produced.

The famous "Potola" chocolate and candy factory in Magdeburg, after a two-year hiatus, has now resumed production and plans to increase production to 100 tons per quarter by 1954.

State-owned and private factories in the Suhl district will produce large quantities of socks, mattresses, wool socks, and knitwear this year. Among them, the production of state-owned factories will be more than six times higher than in the past. The single sheet production of the private Fleischer Brothers Kirschau textile factory in the Bauzen area will increase by 100,000 square meters this year. In addition, the factory has accepted orders for more than 600,000 blankets. State-owned and private factories in Oederan will increase production by 52,000 pairs of children's shoes.

The state-owned "Mifa" bicycle factory in Sangerhausen will increase production of 10,000 children's bicycles this year and improve the style of bicycles.

Housing construction is also expanding. Government funding for residential construction is increasing in various places. In the Magdeburg district, the government has increased funding by 37 million marks to improve people's lives, of which 30 million marks will be used to build 2,800 houses. In the Halle district, the government has allocated 49 million marks for expansion of construction, preparing to complete the framework of 2,000 houses in the district by the end of this year. In the democratic districts of Berlin, 3,000 houses will be built this autumn.

Since August 1, the wages of the lowest-paid fourth-grade workers in state-owned production and trade sectors and public utilities have been generally increased, increasing the purchasing power of workers. Walli Wittich, an assistant at a state-owned store in Leipzig, said that after the wage increase, she can buy one more piece of clothing and two more pairs of shoes, or one more bed sheet each month. Elisabeth Fischner of the Cottbus cooperative store said that the amount of her wage increase is equal to one month's rent. In the health sector, the salaries of medical intellectuals have also increased by 10 percent.

According to the new policy, as of August 1, the Berlin Trust Bank has loaned more than 4 million marks to small handicraft cooperatives in the democratic districts of Berlin to help develop their businesses.

    大量增加消费品生产进一步改善人民生活
    【新华社二日讯】柏林消息：德意志民主共和国各地正在贯彻执行统一社会党和政府所提出的新方针，进一步改善民主德国劳动人民的生活。
    根据统一社会党和政府关于增加消费品生产的决定，食物、纺织品、皮鞋、日用品及儿童玩具等等部门，都纷纷改进和扩大生产，以供应人民的需要。
    “多姆尼茨联合人造牛油工厂”七月份的生产比第二季度提高了一倍。威森堡附近的“米尔卡”人造牛油工厂今年第三季度的生产将比第一季提高一倍。此外，并将提高人造牛油的质量，生产多种多样的人造牛油。
    马格德堡的著名的“波托拉”巧克力糖果工厂在停歇两年之后现在已经恢复生产，并准备到一九五四年时把生产量提高到每季一百吨。
    苏尔区的国营与私营工厂今年要生产大量的袜子、褥子、毛袜和针织品。其中国营工厂的生产将比过去提高到六倍以上。保金地区的私营弗莱塞兄弟克尔绍纺织工厂一个工厂的被单生产量，今年就要增加十万平方公尺，此外，该厂还接受了六十万床以上的毯子定货。欧法特的国营和私营工厂要增加生产五万二千双小孩鞋。
    桑格豪森的国营“米发”自行车厂今年将增加生产一万辆儿童脚踏车，并改进脚踏车的样式。
    房屋的建筑也在扩大。政府在各地对建筑住宅的拨款都在增加。在马格德堡区，政府增加拨款三千七百万马克用于改善人民生活，其中三千万马克用于建造两千八百所住宅。在哈雷区，政府拨款四千九百万马克用作扩大建筑，准备到今年年底，在该区完成两千所房子的构架。在柏林民主区，今年秋季将建造三千幢住宅。
