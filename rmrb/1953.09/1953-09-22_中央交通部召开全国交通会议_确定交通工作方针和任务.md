The Central Ministry of Transportation convened the 1953 National Transportation Conference in Beijing in late August. The conference discussed and determined the current guidelines and tasks for transportation work and resolved important issues such as the guidelines, scope, and organizational leadership of local transportation work.

The conference heard a report from Zhang Bojun, Minister of the Central Ministry of Transportation, on the basic situation of transportation work in the past three years and the direction of future transportation construction and development; a report from Vice Minister Wang Shoudao on the main problems and future guidelines and tasks of current transportation work; a report from Vice Minister Ji Fang on highway management and maintenance; and a special report from Vice Minister Zhang Ce on local transportation work. Group discussions were held. During the conference, Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping of the Government Administration Council gave clear instructions on the achievements and shortcomings of transportation work, the tasks of transportation work, and several major issues in the current work. The conference was concluded by Vice Minister Wang Shoudao.

The conference analyzed and discussed the basic situation and main problems of the current transportation work. In the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, it exposed and criticized the main shortcomings and mistakes in the work according to the Party's and the state's guidelines and policies. The conference held that in the past three years, the transportation industry has basically completed the economic recovery and democratic reform work, and has begun local new construction, initially meeting the needs of the state and the people, and preparing the necessary conditions for the planned construction of the people's transportation industry in the future. However, some shortcomings and individual mistakes in the current transportation work cannot meet the requirements of future national economic development. In order to do a good job in transportation, it is necessary to recognize and grasp the main problems under the unified leadership and planning of the Central Government, determine clear guidelines, strive to improve the operation and management of existing transportation enterprises, and carry out new transportation construction projects in a planned way.

The conference determined that state-owned transportation enterprises should vigorously implement production reform, gradually implement planned management and promote the economic accounting system, develop inland river tug and barge transportation, adhere to coastal and ocean transportation, and ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the state transportation plan. In terms of capital construction, in order to meet the needs of national defense in the coming period, the completion of national defense highway projects will still be the primary task; in terms of transportation, inland waterway construction will be the focus, the development of shallow-water tug and barge transportation, the completion of the renovation of inland river trunk lines, and the construction of new projects with emphasis; gradually increase sea and inland river transportation tools and equipment; and strengthen technical guidance for local road and industrial and mining line construction projects. The leadership and management of private transportation industry must be strengthened, its transportation capacity must be brought into play under the leadership of the state-owned economy, the policy of giving consideration to both public and private interests must be implemented, it must be actively assisted to improve its operation and management, and the maintenance of ships and vehicles must be strengthened. For the private shipping industry at sea and on major inland rivers, the principle of public-private joint operation should be adopted step by step, with preparation and differentiation, on the principle of complete voluntariness of the owners. In the work of transportation administration and management, resolutely implement the unified policy of safe production, strengthen maritime and port supervision, highway and automobile supervision, and improve technical measures and safety equipment in basic construction sites and repair shops.

The conference focused on discussing and determining the work guidelines, management scope, and organizational leadership of local transportation work. The conference determined that the guiding principle of local transportation work in the future is: under the unified plan of the state, combined with local specific conditions, and according to needs and possibilities, to rectify, transform and develop existing transportation undertakings step by step and in a planned way, to strengthen business and technical guidance, to improve enterprise operation and administration, to give play to the capacity of existing equipment, and to focus on developing modern means of transport; to strengthen the management and maintenance of existing highways and waterways, to gradually improve the quality of highways and inland waterway port facilities, to focus on dredging inland waterways, and to build simple standard roads and roads, bridges, and ferries urgently needed by the local people to meet the growing needs of economic construction and the lives of the broad masses of the people. The scope of local transportation work management: (1) Automobile transportation and its affiliated enterprises shall be assigned to local state-owned enterprises and shall be operated by the province (city). (2) The maintenance and construction of local highways, cart tracks, and rural roads, the protection and maintenance of local public welfare undertakings, the maintenance and management of completed national defense highways and economic trunk lines, and the collection and use of road maintenance fees. (3) Short-distance coastal routes, inland river routes within a province, or inland river routes that flow through more than two provinces but are underdeveloped in navigation, the dredging and maintenance of inland waterways, inland river port wharves, and small coastal ports shall be operated and managed by the province (city). (4) The operation and management of urban transportation and urban public transportation. (5) In accordance with state policies, organize and manage private shipping and private automobile transportation industries within the province (city)'s jurisdiction, as well as local public-private joint transportation enterprises. (6) Organize various forms of folk transportation tools in a planned and led manner according to local transportation needs. (7) Other transportation matters related to transportation assigned by the Central Government or the Greater Administrative Region. The conference held that: according to the characteristics and needs of the transportation industry, as well as the experience of the past three years, the implementation of the division of leadership and management between the Central Government and local governments, on the one hand, enables the Central Ministry of Transportation to concentrate its efforts on managing major state-owned enterprises and strengthening guidance on relevant policies and technical assistance to local transportation work; on the other hand, it can better promote the enthusiasm of local governments and the masses, and is conducive to giving play to local manpower and material resources to solve difficult problems. At the same time, the conference pointed out that: after the implementation of the division of leadership and management between the Central Government and local governments, the important issue for transportation departments in various places is to resolutely rely on the local Party committees and governments to strengthen leadership and oppose decentralism, so that it is possible to do a good job in local transportation work.

In order to implement and realize the guidelines and tasks of transportation work determined at this conference, the summary of the conference emphasized the guiding ideology of transportation work in the future: First, we must recognize that the current transportation industry has complex, decentralized, and diverse characteristics. All transportation workers must strive to improve the ideological and political aspects of their work, implement the established guidelines and policies, improve their work methods, and achieve the goal of improving transportation work. Second, overcome the capitalist management ideology. We must clearly understand the socialist nature of state-owned transportation enterprises and their management methods, establish the idea that transportation serves industrial and agricultural production and the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, and first serves the industrialization of the country, and the idea of relying on the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses to do a good job, starting from mastering the country's entire transportation capacity, giving play to the leading role of the state-owned economy, strengthening the leadership and management of private transportation capacity and folk transportation capacity, and gradually incorporating public and private transportation capacity into the normal track of the state plan, so as to provide the country with a large, high-quality, low-priced, and rapid transportation capacity. Third, establish the idea of focusing on construction and giving play to the capacity of existing equipment. Advocate the style of seeking truth from facts, manage existing transportation enterprises well, attach importance to the role of backward transportation tools, give full play to the potential of existing transportation equipment, accumulate experience, train cadres, and prepare for welcoming new development.

The conference formulated practical and feasible regulations, rules, and provisional measures for several specific issues in the current work, such as: the relationship between the Yangtze River trunk and tributaries in the inland river, the organization and management of wooden sailboats and private shipping, the operation and management of local state-owned enterprises, the construction of civilian workers and road maintenance, the collection of road maintenance fees, the division of national highways, the strengthening of state-owned automobile operation management, automobile passenger and freight transportation regulations, and private automobile transportation management.

The conference requested all localities and units to first start with a thorough inspection of the completion of the 1953 plan, take effective measures to solve current problems, and strive to increase production and practice economy, ensure quality, and strive to overfulfill the state plan; then, at an appropriate time, convene a transportation conference to convey and discuss the spirit and decisions of this conference, in order to improve the thinking of cadres and ensure the correct implementation of future work guidelines and tasks.

    中央交通部召开全国交通会议
    确定交通工作方针和任务
    【本报讯】中央人民政府交通部八月下旬在北京召开了一九五三年全国交通会议。会议讨论和确定了目前交通工作的方针任务，并解决了地方交通工作的方针、范围和组织领导等重要问题。
    会议听取了中央人民政府交通部章伯钧部长关于三年来交通工作基本情况与今后交通建设发展的方向的报告，王首道副部长关于目前交通工作的主要问题与今后方针任务的报告，季方副部长关于公路管理和养护工作的报告和张策副部长关于地方交通工作的专题报告，并进行了分组讨论。会议期间，政务院副总理邓小平对交通工作的成绩与缺点、交通工作的任务以及当前工作中几个主要问题作了明确的指示。会议最后由王首道副部长作了总结。
    会议针对目前交通工作的基本情况和存在的主要问题，进行了分析和讨论，以批评与自我批评的精神，根据党和国家的方针政策，揭露和批判了工作中的主要缺点和错误。会议认为：三年多来，交通事业基本上完成了经济恢复工作与民主改革工作，并开始了局部的新的建设，初步地满足了国家和人民的需要，为今后有计划地建设人民交通事业准备了必要的条件。但是，目前交通工作中存在的一些缺点和个别错误，还不能适应今后国民经济发展的要求。为了做好交通工作，必须在中央统一的领导和计划下，认识与掌握当前的主要问题，确定明确的方针，努力改进现有交通运输企业的经营管理，并有计划地进行新的交通建设事业。
    会议确定：国营运输企业今后应大力贯彻生产改革，有步骤地实行计划管理和推行经济核算制，发展内河拖驳运输，坚持沿海与远洋运输，保证完成和超额完成国家运输计划。基本建设在今后一个时期内，为了适应国防需要，仍以完成国防公路工程为首要任务；在运输方面，以内河航运建设为重点，发展浅水拖驳运输，完成内河干线的整修工作，并有重点地进行新建工程；逐渐增强海上和内河的运输工具与设备；加强地方道路和工矿线路修建工程的技术指导。对私营运输业今后必须加强领导与管理，在国营经济领导下，发挥其运输能力，贯彻公私兼顾政策，积极协助其改进经营管理，并加强船舶车辆保修工作；对海上与主要内河私营轮船业，在业主完全自愿的原则下，采取有步骤、有准备、有区别的公私合营的方针。在交通行政管理工作上，坚决贯彻安全生产统一的方针，加强海务、港务监督和公路、汽车监理工作，以及改进基本建设工地和修理厂的技术措施和保安设备等。
    会议着重地讨论并确定了地方交通工作的工作方针、管理范围和组织领导。会议确定今后地方交通工作的方针是：在国家统一计划下，结合当地具体情况，根据需要与可能，对现有运输事业有步骤、有计划地加以整顿、改造与开辟，加强业务技术指导，改进企业经营与行政管理，发挥现有设备能力，并重点地发展近代运输工具；对现有公路与航道加强管理养护，逐步改善公路质量和内河航道港口设备，重点疏浚内河航道，修建适合于当地运输工具的简易标准道路和当地人民迫切需要的道路、桥渡等，以适应日益增长的经济建设和广大人民生活的需要。地方交通工作管理的范围：（一）汽车运输及其附属企业，都划归地方国营，由省（市）负责经营。（二）地方公路、大车道、乡村道路的养护修建，地方公益事业的保护维修，已成的国防公路及经济干线的养护管理，养路费的征收和使用。（三）沿海短程航线，在一省内的内河航线，或虽流经两省以上而航运不发达的内河航线，内河航道的疏浚养护，内河港埠码头、沿海小港，都由省（市）经营管理。（四）城市搬运工作和城市公共交通运输事业的经营管理。（五）根据国家政策，组织与管理省（市）所属区域范围内的私营航业与私营汽车运输业，以及地方公私合营运输企业。（六）根据当地运输的需要，有计划、有领导地组织民间各种运输工具。（七）其他有关中央或大行政区交给办理的交通运输事项。会议认为：根据交通事业的特点和需要，以及三年多来的经验，实行中央与地方的分工领导与管理，一方面使中央交通部能集中力量管理主要国营企业和加强对地方交通工作有关方针政策的指导与技术上的帮助；另一方面更能发扬地方和群众的积极性，有利于发挥地方的民力和物力解决困难问题。同时会议指出：实行中央与地方的分工领导管理后，对各地交通部门说来，重要的问题在于坚决依靠当地党委、政府来加强领导，反对分散主义，才有可能把地方交通工作做好。
    为了贯彻和实现这次会议所确定的交通工作的方针任务，会议的总结中强调提出了今后交通工作的指导思想：第一、必须认识当前交通事业具有复杂、分散、多样的特点，所有交通工作者，必须努力提高工作的思想性、政策性，贯彻执行既定的方针政策，改进工作方法，达到改进交通工作的目的。第二、克服资本主义经营管理思想。必须明确认识国营交通运输企业的社会主义性质及其经营管理方法，树立交通运输为工农业生产与城乡物资交流服务，首先为国家工业化服务的思想和依靠群众的积极性创造性来搞好事业的思想，从掌握国家的整个运输力出发，发挥国营经济的领导作用，加强私营运输力和民间运输力的领导管理，将公私运输力逐渐纳入国家计划的正常轨道，从而为国家提供量大、质好、价廉、迅速的运输力。第三、树立重点建设和发挥现有设备能力的思想。提倡实事求是的作风，要管好现有运输企业和重视落后运输工具的作用，充分发挥现有设备的运输设备的潜在力量，积累经验，培养干部，为迎接新的发展准备条件。
      会议对当前工作中的若干具体问题，如：内河方面的长江干支关系、木帆船与私营航业的组织管理、地方国营企营经营管理，公路方面的民工建勤、养路费征收、国道划分，公路运输方面的加强国营汽车经营管理、汽车客货运输规章、私营汽车运输管理，都制定了切实可行的条例、规章和暂行办法。
    会议要求各地、各单位首先从深入检查一九五三年计划完成的情况入手，采取解决当前问题的有效措施，努力增产节约，保证质量，为超额完成国家计划而奋斗；然后在适当时期，再召开交通会议，传达讨论这次会议的精神和决定，以提高干部思想，保证今后工作方针任务的正确执行。
