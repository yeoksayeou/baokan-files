In Zhengzhou, the name of a young woman is being spread among many people. She is indeed worthy of praise. She was originally a girl from the countryside who rarely left her home after moving to the city, but later became a street activist. She was originally illiterate, but now she can read popular books and newspapers. Moreover, she became a production team leader in the cone winding workshop not long after she joined the state-owned Zhengzhou Cotton Textile Factory. However, this is not the whole story of why people praise her. More importantly, she demonstrated the pure qualities and noble morality of a new China woman in dealing with her relationship with her husband. Her name is Li Jingyun.

In October 1948, Zhengzhou was liberated. Her husband, Mao Yuan, in order to dedicate his strength to the great cause of liberating the motherland, signed up to join the People's Liberation Army. He explained the reasons for joining the army to Li Jingyun, and Li Jingyun felt that he was right. Although she was somewhat reluctant to part, she agreed. Before he left, her husband repeatedly told her: "The new society is very different from the past. Women also have status now. Don't stay at home like before. Participate in social activities, study hard, and strive for progress!" At that time, they had only been married for just ten months.

When her husband left, it so happened that her mother-in-law was not at home. When her mother-in-law returned and heard that her son had joined the army and gone south, she blamed her daughter-in-law. Her mother-in-law was worried that her son would suffer in the army after leaving home, and she was also worried that her son would not return for a while and her daughter-in-law would change her mind. So she often said to her daughter-in-law with anger, testing her: "My son is gone, not knowing whether he is alive or dead. You are still young, what's the point of guarding him?" Li Jingyun patiently explained to her mother-in-law. At the same time, she also firmly remembered her husband's instructions before he left, and began to participate in street work, gradually becoming an activist among the masses, often calling meetings, participating in reading groups, and studying work with male comrades. At this time, some backward elements spread rumors about Li Jingyun, saying that she wanted to get divorced or that she would change her mind. Of course, her mother-in-law also disliked her daughter-in-law's appearance, and said to Jingyun in person: "You are running around too much, your heart has grown bigger, and you can still look up to my Zhenqing (Mao Yuan's nickname)." Although she felt wronged, she patiently explained to her mother-in-law. The difficulties she encountered when she first started working, the cold words from outsiders, and her mother-in-law's suspicions really made her not know what to do. She entrusted someone to write a letter to her husband telling him about these situations, hoping to get help from her husband. Soon, her husband's letter arrived. After greatly encouraging her in the letter, he said: "Don't worry about these things. A young person in the new society should not bow their head to difficulties. You must muster the courage to fight against feudal ideas and feudal habits. You must remember that you are a young woman in the new society, the wife of a revolutionary soldier." She was extremely happy, and told her mother-in-law the contents of the letter, and constantly told her mother-in-law some revolutionary principles. Her mother-in-law's thinking gradually became enlightened, and she was slightly better to her. Her work became more active, and she was soon elected as the residents' group leader. Since then, she and her husband often corresponded, and each letter from her husband was an encouragement to her work and life, and she felt that her husband was even more lovable.

However, for more than two years, Mao Yuan had been hiding one thing, that is, he was seriously wounded in his left arm in the battle to liberate Chongqing in 1949. In the hospital, his left arm was amputated, becoming disabled. After being discharged from the hospital, he continued to actively participate in the work and followed the army into the Kangzang Plateau. Of course, he felt that his injury and disability were glorious, and he also felt happy that he could continue to work for the revolution after becoming disabled. But there was one thing he was always worried about: Would his wife still love him? This was the reason why he had been hiding this fact. Every time he wrote to his wife, in addition to encouraging her to work hard and progress and expressing concern for her health and life, he always added a few sentences: "I am a Communist Party member. In order to defend the frontier of the motherland, I cannot go home. Do you have any opinions?" He always wanted to test Jingyun's attitude. As the number of times increased, Jingyun also felt a little strange: Why does he always ask this? Her every letter answered very firmly: "Wherever the people need you, you go there. I have no opinions, please rest assured!" Every time Mao Yuan saw such a reply, he was moved again. As time went on, he felt that he could no longer hide it and should tell his beloved the truth.

Last spring, Jingyun received another letter from her husband, which also included a photo of him after he became disabled. The letter read: "Jingyun: For the cause of the liberation of the motherland and the people, I had already shed blood in the battle to liberate Chongqing and became disabled. However, I am a Communist Party member, and I am still young. I want to continue fighting." After reading the letter and looking at the photo, she couldn't control her emotions for a moment, and cried out. She cried for two reasons: one was that she felt that her lovable husband still didn't understand her, didn't believe her, and had been hiding this from her for more than two years; the other was that she felt that her disabled husband was so far away from her, and his daily life could not get any care from his wife. She immediately wrote back a letter, saying: "Zhenqing: It is glorious for you to be injured and disabled for the sake of the motherland. As for me, please rest assured, I want to be with you forever, and I think it is also glorious." In addition to attaching a photo of herself, she also expressed her willingness to go to her husband's place, do something there, and take care of him.

The reply quickly arrived in Zhengzhou from the Kangzang Plateau, saying:

"Jingyun: After reading the letter and photo you sent, I deeply feel your sincere love for me, which has given me infinite comfort. Your progress is too fast, too great, beyond my expectations. You are indeed worthy of being an advanced woman of the new China. I hope you continue to work hard to improve yourself. We are still young. Under the leadership of the Party, our future is infinitely bright, and our life will be infinitely happy. Let us move forward side by side! I am working hard and living happily on the Kangzang Plateau. The organization is also taking good care of me, so please rest assured!
Your lover Zhenqing"

From then on, their correspondence became more frequent and their feelings became closer. In the second half of last year, Li Jingyun entered the Zhengzhou Textile Training Class. She was determined to learn a production technology to serve the construction of the motherland. In the training class, she learned culture and technology, and she did encounter many difficulties. But due to her enthusiasm for participating in the construction of the motherland, and thanks to the help and encouragement of her husband's frequent letters, she finally completed her studies. Upon graduation, she could read popular books and newspapers and write letters to her husband in her own handwriting. Then she joined the state-owned Zhengzhou Cotton Textile Factory and soon became the production team leader in the cone winding workshop.

When the reporter went to visit her, she excitedly took out more than a dozen letters that her husband had written to her for the reporter to see. At the same time, she told the reporter that her husband's most recent letter hoped that she could visit him on the Kangzang Plateau if possible, and he also sent a sum of money. Immediately, she explained to the reporter: The factory has just been established, there are few people, and she has just started to learn the production technology, and she is serving as the team leader, so she cannot leave. Finally, she said: "Participating in the great construction of the motherland is important, and personal matters should be put aside first! I have written to tell him that I cannot go for the time being, and to ask him to work hard and build the border areas. The future is long!"

    真挚的爱
    袁谅
    在郑州，有一个年轻妇女的名字，在很多人中间传颂着。她也的确值得传颂，她从前本来是一个闭门不出的从农村到城里的姑娘，后来成了街道积极分子。她从前本来一个大字不识，现在能阅读通俗书报，还有，她进了国营郑州棉纺织厂没有多久就在筒子间当了生产小组长了。可是，这还不是人们称颂她的全部内容，更重要的是她在处理和她丈夫的关系上表现了新中国妇女的纯真品质和高尚道德。她的名字就叫李景云。
    一九四八年十月，郑州解放了。她的丈夫毛渊为了在解放祖国的伟大事业中献出一份力量，就报名参加了解放军，他把参军的道理讲给李景云听，李景云觉得很对，虽然有些恋恋不舍，还是同意了。她丈夫临走时还再三叮嘱：“新社会和从前大不相同了，妇女也有地位了，再不要像从前闭门不出，要参加社会活动，要好好学习，努力进步！”当时，她们结婚才刚刚十个月。
    她丈夫走时，可巧她婆婆不在家。她婆婆一回来，听得儿子参军南下了，就呕媳妇的气。她婆婆耽心自己的儿子离了家在军队上吃苦，又耽心儿子一下不回来媳妇变了心，就常生气地对媳妇试探着说：“我儿子出去不知是死是活，你还年青，空守了他做啥？”李景云就给婆婆耐心地解释。同时她也牢牢记着丈夫临走前的叮嘱，开始参加了街道上的工作，渐渐变成群众中的积极分子了，常常召集开会，参加读报组，和男同志一块研究工作。就在这时，有的落后分子就说李景云的闲话，说她要离婚呀；要变心呀；她婆婆当然也看不惯媳妇这种样子，当着景云的面就说：“跑红了，心眼也大了，还能看起俺振卿（毛渊的小名）。”她虽蹩着一肚子委曲还是耐心地给婆婆解释。刚刚参加工作碰到的困难，外人的冷言冷语，婆婆的疑神疑鬼，真使她不知怎么样好。她就把这些情形托人写信告诉了她丈夫，希望从丈夫那里得到帮助。不久，丈夫的信来了。信中把她大大鼓励了一番以后说：“你不要顾虑这些，一个新社会的青年是不应该向困难低头的，你要鼓起勇气向封建思想和封建习惯斗争，你要记着自己是一个新社会的青年妇女，是一个革命军人的妻子。”她真高兴极了，就把信的内容讲给婆婆听，还不断地给婆婆讲些革命的道理，婆婆的思想也渐渐开朗了，对她也稍稍好了些。她的工作更积极了，很快就被选为居民小组长。此后，她和她丈夫就常常通信，丈夫的每封来信，都对她的工作和生活是一种鼓舞，她觉得丈夫更可爱了。
    可是，足有两年多的时间，毛渊却一直隐瞒着一件事，就是他在一九四九年解放重庆的战斗中左臂负了重伤，在医院左臂被截去，成为残废了，出院后，他照常积极地参加了工作，并随军进入康藏高原。对自己的受伤残废，他当然觉得是光荣的，残废以后能够继续为革命工作，他也觉得是愉快的。但有一点他总是不放心：他的妻子会不会还爱他呢？这就是他一直隐瞒着这件事实的原因。他每次给妻子写信，除了鼓励妻子努力进步和表示关心妻子的身体和生活外，老是注上这么几句：“我是一个共产党员，为了保卫祖国的边疆，不能回家了，你有啥意见吗？”他每次都想试探景云的态度。次数多了，景云也觉着有些奇怪：他为啥老是这样问呢？她的每封信都回答得很坚决：“人民需要你到那里，你就到那里，我没啥意见，请放心！”毛渊每看到一次这样的答复就被感动一次，时间长了，他觉得再不能隐瞒下去了，应该把事实告诉自己的爱人。
    去年春天，景云又一次接到了丈夫的信，信中还附了一张残废后的照片。信上写着：“景云：为了祖国人民的解放事业，我早已在解放重庆的战斗中洒出了鲜血，成为残废了。可是，我是一个共产党员，年纪还轻，我要继续战斗下去。”她读了信，看了照片，一时控制不住自己的感情，哇地一声哭起来了。她哭有两个原因：一个是她觉得这样可爱的丈夫还是这样不了解她，不相信她，把这件事两年多来都在隐瞒着她；另一个是她感到残废了的丈夫离自己是这么远，起居饮食，得不到自己妻子的一点照顾。她马上就回了一封信，信上说：“振卿：你为了祖国，受伤残废，这是光荣的，至于我，请你放心，我要永远和你在一起，我觉得也是光荣的。”信中除附了自己的一张照片，还表示愿意到丈夫那里去，一边做点什么事，一边还可以照顾他。
    回信很快从康藏高原上到了郑州，信上说：
    “景云：看过你寄来的信和照片，深深觉得你对我的衷爱，使我得到了无限的安慰，你的进步太快了，太大了，出我意料之外，你的确不愧为新中国的一个先进妇女。希望你继续努力，提高自己，我们都还年轻，在党的领导下，我们的前途是无限光明的，生活也将会无限幸福的，让我们并肩前进！我在康藏高原上工作紧张，生活愉快，组织上也对我照顾的周到，请你放心吧！
    你的爱人振卿”
    从此，他俩的通信更多了，感情也更亲密了。去年下半年，李景云进了郑州市的纺织训练班，她决心学习一种生产技术，为祖国建设服务。在训练班学文化又学技术，她的确碰到不少困难，可是由于她参加祖国建设的热情，由于丈夫常常来信的帮助和鼓励，她终于完成了学习任务，结业时她已可以阅读通俗书报，可以亲笔给丈夫写信了。接着她就进了国营郑州棉纺织厂，不久就当了筒子间的生产小组长。
    当记者去访问她时，她兴奋地拿出她丈夫写给她的十多封信给记者看，同时告诉记者，她丈夫最近来的一封信希望她可能的话到康藏高原去看他，还汇来一笔钱。马上，她又给记者解释起来：工厂才建立，人手少，生产技术她刚摸上门，自己又担任着小组长，是离不开的。最后她说：“参加祖国大建设要紧，个人的事先搁一下吧！我已写信告诉了他，说我暂时不能去，要他努力工作，建设边疆，将来日子还长着哩！”
