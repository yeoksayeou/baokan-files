    All Basic Construction Units Should Prevent Damage to Farmers' Interests When Requisitioning Land in Rural Areas

    Many reader letters reflect that since last winter and this spring, more than twenty basic construction units under the Central People's Government, the North China Administrative Committee, and the Beijing Municipal People's Government have successively purchased large amounts of land and housing in Tongxian, Changping, and Liangxiang near Beijing, preparing for large-scale basic construction. Because of the sudden surge in the number of basic construction units in these areas, the units are severely lacking in planning when purchasing land and housing, hiring workers, and preparing materials. Some units, proceeding purely from their own interests in the process of purchasing land and housing, neglect the production and life of the local people, and the government has not yet clearly defined the approval authority and procedures for requisitioning land and housing, which has seriously affected the production of local farmers.

    Some basic construction units, without the introduction of the local county and district people's governments, directly measured, staked, flagged, and dug holes everywhere. When farmers asked them "What are you doing?" they did not explain, and even answered simply, "Just wait, you'll know when the time comes." This made the local people feel suspicious and lose confidence in production. The construction sites of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the Ministry of Fuel Industry, and a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in the eighth district of Tongxian all secretly measured and surveyed before notifying the local government. At that time, local farmers reflected: "There's no need to apply fertilizer to the land! It might be bought someday, and applying fertilizer would be a waste of effort." Last winter, Yang Kai, a model agricultural laborer in Xiaoxizhuang, Liangxiang, was brewing the establishment of an agricultural production cooperative in the village. At this time, the Civil Engineering Company of the Ministry of Fuel Industry went to the village's land to insert markers and drive piles. As a result, the farmers all lost their energy, and the cooperative could not be organized. However, now the Civil Engineering Company of the Ministry of Fuel Industry has decided not to purchase land and build a factory here, which has caused even greater dissatisfaction among the farmers.

    Some basic construction units did not properly take care of the interests of the masses in places where they should and could have been appropriately taken care of when purchasing land and housing. For example, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army bought more than 1,000 mu of land in Changping, but did not buy the fruit trees in the land; it was very inconvenient for the farmers to prune the branches and pick the fruits. A certain unit of the Central Broadcasting Administration bought land from farmers by "hollowing out" the land, leaving only a few li or fen of land for the sellers Yang Defeng, Liang Yongcheng, and others, making it impossible for them to farm. The Construction Engineering Company of the Hydropower Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry bought more than 1,000 mu of land in Shuangqiao, Tongxian, and surrounded it with barbed wire, leaving no passage for the people. When farmers wanted to cultivate the remaining land, they had to take a detour of three more li. Some units destroyed the crops in the fields before the land was finally purchased. The crops on Jin Suoquan's thirteen mu of land in Xianninghou Village, Changping, were all damaged. A main road was built on Wang Shilu's ten mu of land. Many sand and stones were piled up in Wang Shan's five mu of wheat field, and large pits were dug.

    Some basic construction units purchased land in advance without the approval of higher authorities or relevant departments, and therefore could not start construction in time after purchasing the land, resulting in the wasteland of good land. For example, the autumn crops this year were not planted on the land purchased by the Biological Products Research Institute of the Ministry of Health and a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army in the eighth district of Tongxian. Some basic construction units did not provide appropriate resettlement for the households selling land and housing after purchasing land and houses from farmers. Some households that mainly engaged in farming worried: "The land and houses are all gone, and we only have some money in our hands. We can't do sideline occupations, no one wants to hire us to work, and we won't be able to live when the money is gone." Some basic construction units blindly recruited farmers to work in the factory after purchasing land and building a factory without going through the local people's government. After the brick factory of the Ministry of Fuel Industry was built near Houdian Village, Liangxiang, it blindly absorbed farmers from the village, leaving only seven or eight laborers in the village, making it impossible to carry out agricultural production.

    Of course, basic construction is a major plan for the country's long-term interests. It also represents the long-term interests of farmers. With the increasing progress of economic construction, many agricultural lands will become industrial lands. It is a normal, inevitable, necessary, and also gratifying phenomenon for basic construction departments to requisition land and housing and build factories in the suburbs. Therefore, the county and district people's governments must mobilize and educate the farmers, dispel their concerns, and assist the basic construction departments in requisitioning land and housing and carrying out construction. However, such behaviors as those mentioned above, which are divorced from the masses of farmers, must be resolutely stopped. Paying attention only to the long-term interests of the people while ignoring the immediate interests of the people will undermine the Party's correct construction line. According to our understanding, the Central People's Government and the North China Administrative Committee have paid attention to the problems that have occurred in the requisition of land and housing in the Tongxian Special District, and have taken necessary measures. The Shuangqiao Engineering Area of the Construction Engineering Company of the Hydropower Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry and a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army have conducted inspections and dealt with the events of harming the interests of the masses in the purchase of land. At present, the chaotic situation in the requisition of land and housing in the Tongxian Special District has begun to improve. However, it should be pointed out that the incidents of secretly surveying and measuring everywhere without the introduction of the local people's government have not been completely eliminated. Further improving this work requires the efforts of all relevant units.

    In order to prevent similar problems from continuing to occur in the requisition of land and housing by various basic construction units, readers' letters put forward the following suggestions: In the future, all basic construction units must strictly compress land use plans, and try not to purchase land that can be purchased or not purchased; land that has been purchased and is not under construction for the time being should be handed over to farmers for cultivation and should not be deserted. When it is necessary to requisition land from farmers, it should first be approved by the local government and agreed to by the masses, and a reasonable land price should be set for the land to be requisitioned. Only after appropriate resettlement measures have been taken for the farmers whose land is to be requisitioned can the land requisition work be carried out, otherwise, land requisition and private surveying, staking, etc. shall not be carried out. Units that have damaged the interests of farmers should conduct serious inspections and compensate and apologize to the farmers who have suffered losses in order to restore the adverse effects and stabilize the farmers' production mood. These suggestions are also worthy of attention for construction units in other industrial cities that are expanding or being built.

### 各基本建设单位在农村征购土地时应防止损害农民利益

    各基本建设单位在农村征购土地时应防止损害农民利益
    许多读者来信反映：去冬和今春，中央人民政府、华北行政委员会和北京市人民政府所属二十几个基本建设单位，先后在北京附近的通县、昌平和良乡境内，购买了大量的土地和民房，准备进行大规模的基本建设。由于上述这些地区基本建设单位骤然激增，各单位在购地、买房、雇工和备料时十分缺乏计划，有的单位在购地买房过程中单纯从本位利益出发，忽视当地群众的生产和生活，而政府对于征购土地民房的批准权限和手续一时还没有明确规定，以致严重地影响了当地农民的生产。
    某些基本建设单位不经当地县区人民政府的介绍，即直接到处测量、栽桩、插旗和挖坑。农民问他们是“干啥的？”他们不加解释，甚至干脆回答：“你等着，到时候就知道。”这样就使当地群众产生疑惧，对生产没有信心。中央重工业部、中央燃料工业部、中国人民解放军某部在通县八区的基本建设工地，都是这样私自先行测量勘察然后才通知当地政府的。当时，当地农民就这样反映：“地里不用上粪啦！说不定哪天会被买去，上粪不是白费劲了吗？”良乡小西庄农业劳动模范杨恺，去冬在村中酝酿建立农业生产合作社；正在这时，中央燃料工业部土木建筑工程公司到这个村的地里去插标、打桩。这样一来，农民都松了劲，合作社也组织不起来了。可是，现在中央燃料工业部土木建筑工程公司却又决定不在这里购地建厂了，这样就更引起农民的不满。
    某些基本建设单位在购地买房时应该而且可能适当照顾群众利益的地方也未适当照顾。如人民解放军某部在昌平买了一千多亩地，但不买地里的果树；农民们要整果枝、采果子都很不方便。中央广播事业管理局某单位购买农民的土地是“掏心”买，给卖主杨德奉、梁永城等留下来几厘几分地，使人家没法种。中央燃料工业部水力发电建设总局建筑工程公司在通县双桥买了一千多亩地，围上铁丝网，不给人家留走道。农民要种剩下来的土地时，要绕道多走三里地。有的单位在地还未最后购妥时，就轻率地把人家地里的庄稼都毁了。昌平咸宁侯村农民金锁全的十三亩地庄稼全给搞坏了。王世禄的十亩地给轧了一条大道。王善的五亩麦子地中被堆了许多砂石，并挖了大坑。
    还有一些基本建设单位未经上级机关或有关部门批准，就先行购地，因而购地后不能及时动工，以致使大好土地荒芜。例如中央卫生部生物制品研究所、人民解放军某部在通县八区所购的土地，今年的秋季作物都没有种上。有的基本建设单位购买了农民的土地房屋以后，对卖房地户没有给以适当安置，部分以务农为主的卖房地户就这样发愁：“地房全没了，只是手里有点钱，副业不会干，做工没人要，把钱吃光了日子就没法过。”也有的基本建设单位购地建厂以后，没有通过当地人民政府便盲目吸收农民进厂做工。良乡后店村有百余个劳动力，中央燃料工业部制砖厂在该村附近建厂以后，盲目吸收该村农民，以致该村只剩下七、八个劳动力，农业生产没法进行。
    当然，基本建设是国家的百年大计。它也代表着农民的长远利益。随着经济建设日益进展，许多农业用的土地将变为工业用的土地。基本建设部门到郊区征购房地和兴建工厂，这是一种正常的、必然的、必要的，同时也是可喜的现象。因此，县区人民政府必须动员和教育农民群众，解除他们的顾虑，协助基本建设部门征购房地，进行建设。但是，像上述那些脱离农民群众的行为，必须坚决制止。只顾人民长远利益而不顾人民眼前利益，会破坏党的正确建设路线。据我们了解：中央人民政府和华北行政委员会已经重视通县专区征购房地中所发生的问题，并采取了必要的措施。中央燃料工业部水力发电建设总局建筑工程公司双桥工区和人民解放军某部对于在购地中损害群众利益的事件，已作了检查和处理。目前通县专区在征购房地中的混乱现象已开始好转。但，应当指出：未经当地人民政府的介绍便私自到处勘察测量的事件还不是已经完全绝迹了，进一步地搞好这一工作，还需要各有关单位的努力。
    为了防止各基本建设单位在征购房地时继续发生类似问题，读者来信提出下列建议：今后各基本建设单位必须严格压缩用地计划，做到可购可不购者，尽量不购；既已购用之土地、暂不施工者，应交给农民耕种，不得荒芜。在必须征购农民的土地时，应首先经当地政府批准，群众同意，对被征购的土地定出合理地价，对被征购土地的农民有适当的安置办法之后，才能进行征购土地工作，否则不得进行征购及私自测量、插标等等。已经损害到农民利益的单位，认真进行检查并对受到损失的农民，进行赔偿和道歉，以挽回不良影响，稳定农民生产情绪。这些建议，对于其他正在扩大或建设的工业城市中的建设单位来说，也同样是值得重视的。
