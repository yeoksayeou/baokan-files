The Grain Bureau of Guizhou Provincial People's Government Issues a Circular
Commending Two Units for Doing a Good Job in Wheat Procurement

On August 26, the Grain Bureau of Guizhou Provincial People's Government issued a circular commending the Guiding County Grain Company and the Suiyang County Grain Bureau for their outstanding performance in wheat procurement.

The circular pointed out that in the early stage of wheat procurement, the Guiding County Grain Company overcame difficulties despite having few personnel, small warehouse capacity, and many farmers selling wheat. This was achieved through the staff's continuous study of their work and improvement of work methods. First, they explored various ways to facilitate farmers' sales of grain. They adopted a "grain and quota calculation table" and changed the triplicate form to a duplicate form. They mobilized the masses to maintain order themselves, ensuring fast weighing, fast receiving, and fast payment. They started work before 8:00 AM every day and continued until all the grain was received; they did not rest at noon, taking turns eating; and they continued to work on Sundays. They achieved immediate acceptance, fast acceptance, and increased acceptance. Second, they paid attention to publicizing policies to the masses in various ways. They used megaphones to explain policies to the masses, and displayed samples of four grades of wheat: superior, medium, inferior, and ungraded. They distinguished between grades and varieties, and set reasonable prices, thus conscientiously implementing the policy of grading and pricing. In particular, the acceptance of both good and substandard wheat greatly satisfied the needs of wheat farmers. The daily procurement volume of Guiding County Grain Company reached a maximum of 26,000 jin, and usually exceeded 10,000 jin. The Guiding County Grain Company's performance in wheat procurement over the past two months has been remarkable; it exceeded the quota for July by 20 percent, and the procurement volume accounted for more than 85 percent of the wheat on the market.

The circular then pointed out that the Suiyang County Grain Bureau also achieved good results in wheat procurement. The bureau completed 175.95 percent of the procurement plan in July; the procured wheat accounted for 86 to 95 percent of the wheat on the market. The bureau's success was mainly due to the implementation of the higher authorities' instructions to boldly procure wheat, especially by boldly relying on cooperatives to procure wheat on their behalf, and by correctly implementing the price policy. The bureau staff also paid attention to simplifying procedures, ensuring fast service, a good attitude, correct grading, and reasonable prices, which was welcomed by the farmers.

    贵州省人民政府粮食厅发出通报
    表扬做好小麦收购工作的两个单位
    贵州省人民政府粮食厅八月二十六日发出通报，表扬收购小麦工作中成绩优良的贵定县粮食公司和绥阳县粮食局。
    通报指出：贵定县粮食公司收购小麦的初期，在人员少、仓库容量小、售麦农民多的情况下，经过工作人员不断钻研业务、改进工作方法，克服了困难。首先，他们多方面地想办法便利农民售粮。他们采用了“定粮定额计算表”，把三联单改为二联单。他们发动群众自己维持秩序，切实做到过磅快、收货快、付款快。他们每天上午八点钟以前就开始工作，一直到收完为止；中午也不休息，大家轮流吃饭；星期日照常收购，坚持工作。他们做到了随到随收、快收、多收。其次，他们注意用各种方式向群众宣传政策。他们用传话筒向群众讲解政策，同时陈列了上、中、下和不列等四种小麦的样品，分别等级、品种，订出合理价格，做到认真贯彻分等论价的政策。特别是由于好麦、次麦都收，大大满足了麦农的要求。贵定县粮食公司每日收购量，最高的曾达到二万六千斤，平时也能够收进一万多斤。两个多月来，该县粮食公司收购小麦的成绩是很显著的；七月份超额完成任务百分之二十，收购量占小麦上市量的百分之八十五以上。
    通报接着指出：绥阳县粮食局收购小麦工作也是有成绩的。该局七月份完成收购计划百分之一百七十五点九五；收购的小麦，占上市小麦数量的百分之八十六到九十五。该局获得成绩的原因，主要是贯彻执行了上级放手收购的指示，特别是放手依靠合作社代为收购，同时正确执行了价格政策。该局工作人员并注意简化手续，做到办事快、态度好、分等正确、价钱合理，因而受到了农民的欢迎。
