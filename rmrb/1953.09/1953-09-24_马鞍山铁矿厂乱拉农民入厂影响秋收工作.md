    Ma'anshan Iron Mine Randomly Recruits Peasants, Affecting Autumn Harvest

    Su Min and Dai Chun of the Cihu District People's Government in Dangtu County, Anhui Province, write: The state-owned Ma'anshan Iron Mine frequently recruits peasants from nearby villages as long-term or temporary workers without going through the local government. For example, on August 12th, a cadre of the factory, Wang Guoshou, summoned cadres from six nearby villages to a meeting in his private capacity, without contacting the Labor Section of the County People's Government or the District People's Government beforehand, asking each village to recommend workers. The village cadres didn't know what to do and rushed to the district government to ask for instructions. The district government raised an objection to the factory, stating that rural labor should not be casually recruited during the busy farming season, but the factory cadre was very dissatisfied.

    The factory's practice of randomly recruiting workers in rural areas has already affected agricultural production in the villages near the mine. Currently, in the 15th, 16th, 17th, and 18th electoral districts of Xiantang Township alone, more than 60 people have entered the factory to work without being introduced by the government (excluding those who were introduced). The local autumn harvest is already feeling the shortage of labor.

    We believe that if the Ma'anshan Iron Mine needs to recruit workers in the future, it should make plans in advance and strengthen contact with the local government. This will not only guarantee the labor needed for industrial construction, but also avoid affecting agricultural production.

### 马鞍山铁矿厂乱拉农民入厂影响秋收工作

专栏：读者来信摘要

    马鞍山铁矿厂乱拉农民入厂影响秋收工作
    安徽省当涂县慈湖区人民政府苏民、戴春来信：国营马鞍山铁矿厂经常不经过地方政府，随便吸收矿区附近各乡农民进厂当长工或临时工。例如，八月十二日该厂干部王国寿事先不和县人民政府劳动科或区人民政府取得联系，就以私人名义召集附近六个乡的干部来开会，要各乡介绍工人。乡干部不知怎么办好，纷纷跑到区政府来请示办法。区政府向该厂提出意见，说明在农忙期间不应随便吸收农村劳动力，该厂干部还很不满意。
    该厂在农村乱拉工人的做法，已经影响了矿区附近农村的农业生产。目前仅贤塘乡第十五、十六、十七、十八四个选区，未经政府介绍就入厂做工的已有六十多人（经介绍的除外），当地收割秋禾就感到劳动力不够。
    我们认为，马鞍山铁矿厂今后要招收工人，应该事先做好计划，并和地方政府加强联系，这样不但可以保证工业建设所需要的劳动力，同时也能避免影响农业生产。
