    Leadership Collectivity is the Supreme Principle of Party Leadership
    By Yakovlev, Soviet Union
    The Communist Party of the Soviet Union – the leading force of Soviet society – has achieved new victories in the struggle to build communism in the Soviet Union by strictly adhering to the principles of party leadership and the norms of inner-party life established by the great Lenin. These principles and norms stipulate: to most strictly observe the requirements of the Party Constitution, to thoroughly implement the principle of democratic centralism, to strive to promote the initiative of ordinary party members, and to collectively discuss important issues in party life. As Lenin taught, the normal activities of party organizations and the entire party are only possible under the condition of strictly adhering to the principle of collective leadership. The principle of collective leadership ensures that the Party avoids randomness and one-sidedness in the resolutions it adopts. The strength of the Party's leadership lies in collectivity, unity, and consistency. Collectivity is the supreme leadership principle within our Party. The formulation of correct Party policies and the victorious implementation of these policies in practice directly depend on adhering to this principle.
    The Party's principle of collective leadership is fully in line with the famous Marxist-Leninist principle regarding the harm and impermissibility of the personality cult. The personality cult leads to a disregard for the role of the Party and its leadership core, leads to a reduction in the creative initiative of party members and the Soviet people, it has nothing in common to the Marxist-Leninist understanding of the enormous significance of the guiding activities of leading organs and leaders. Only the collective experience and collective wisdom of the Party Central Committee, based on the scientific principles of Marxist-Leninist theory and the broad initiative of leading cadres, can guarantee the correct leadership of the Party and the state, guarantee the unwavering unity of the Party ranks, and guarantee the smooth construction of communism in our country.
    Adhering to the firm norms of inner-party life, adhering to the principle of collective leadership, is one of the most important prerequisites for further consolidating the ideological and organizational unity of the Party ranks and strengthening the combat effectiveness of party organizations. When the entire party (from top to bottom) collectively discusses and decides issues on the basis of criticism and self-criticism carried out from below – under such conditions, it will be possible to expose and eliminate shortcomings in work and distortions of Party policies, and to expose the conspiracies and intrigues of enemies of the Party and the people in a timely manner. Collective leadership facilitates the training of cadres and the promotion of new creative forces hidden within our Party into leadership positions. Collectivity is a necessary condition for implementing genuine Party supervision of cadres, of any worker (no matter how high their position), and is a necessary condition for educating workers in the spirit of loyalty to the interests of the Party and the state. Practice has proven that without the principle of collectivity, there will be a lack of supervision over individual workers, which will lead to secretly substituting individually given orders for collectively formulated resolutions, leading to deciding issues groundlessly and unilaterally, and abolishing criticism and criticism from below. This creates fertile ground for major errors and distortions, which will greatly damage the interests of the Party and the state.
    The Seventh Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union re-emphasized the great practical significance of the principles of Party leadership. The plenary session of the Central Committee pointed out that – as one of the most important tasks of party organizations – it is necessary to fully strengthen the Party's leadership in all links of Party organs and state organs, to most strictly adhere to the principle of collective leadership of the Party, and to resolutely eradicate phenomena that undermine this principle.
    The collectivity of Party leadership is inherent in the nature of the Communist Party as a democratic party and a voluntary fighting alliance of ideologically consistent communists. Lenin, in explaining the Party's democracy, pointed out that in a party organized according to democracy, "...all party members, with equal rights, directly or through representatives, lead all the undertakings of the party without exception..." (Lenin's Complete Works, Volume 11, page 396).
    Marxism-Leninism teaches us that the Communist Party is an independent fighting organization of the working class, it thinks actively, lives vigorously, destroys the old and creates the new. Some people believe that the Party is seemingly not an independent institution, but rather some kind of composite similar to an administrative management organ, where there are senior staff and junior staff. This view is extremely wrong and has nothing in common with Marxism. This harmful and dangerous view of the Party has produced bureaucratism in the Party's activities in practice, with individual Party leaders considering themselves "senior staff," attempting to base all work on individual orders, and failing to attach importance to attracting Communist Party members to participate in the Party's leadership, stifling their initiative and activism. The Party resolutely eradicates any attempt to bureaucratize the Party's work, and creates all necessary conditions for the manifestation of the creativity of Communist Party members.
    Historical experience teaches us that the high activism and initiative of party members is one of the deepest sources of the invincibility of the Party's cause. No matter what tasks our Communist Party faces: establishing and consolidating the alliance between the working class and the working peasantry, overthrowing the regime of capitalists and landlords, establishing and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, defending the Soviet Republic from the aggression of foreign interventionists and White Guards during the Civil War, national industrialization, establishing collective farm systems in rural areas, ensuring the victory of the Soviet Union in the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945, and the enormous post-war peaceful construction work – and each of these tasks has been able to be resolved precisely because the Party attracts all its members to actively and consciously implement the Party's policies.
    Our Party adheres to the requirements of democratic centralism in all its organizational activities, because this principle guarantees the combination of centralism (that is, the strictest discipline) with the promotion of initiative (that is, the activism of party members). The Party understands democracy as enhancing the activism and awareness of party members, and gradually attracting them not only to participate in discussing issues, but also to participate in leadership work. Party organizations fully apply the principles of democratic centralism to their inner-party life, thus providing the necessary conditions for the realization of the Party's collective leadership. With the development of inner-party democracy, the collectivity in the work of Party organs also grows.
    Under today's conditions, when Party organizations are implementing the tasks put forward by the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and implementing a number of important measures formulated by the Party Central Committee and the Soviet government in recent months, it is necessary for party members to participate more actively in the Party's leadership. Further improving the leadership of the state and the leadership of the economy, consolidating the Soviet state and national defense, strengthening the fraternal friendship of all nationalities and educating the working people in the spirit of socialist internationalism, and raising the material and cultural level of the Soviet people – all of this, as at any time, requires the thorough adoption of the principles of inner-party democracy, that is, the principle of collective leadership of the Party.
    Therefore, it should be pointed out the profound significance of the supplementary clauses added by the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the provisions of the obligations of party members. Our Party's new Party Constitution enhances each Communist Party member's sense of responsibility for the Party's common cause. The more complete provisions in the new Party Constitution regarding the rights and obligations of party members illustrate the orientation of further absorbing party members to participate in leading the work of the Party. The most important characteristics of inner-party democracy are clearly reflected in the obligations of party members: This is the democracy of action, enabling our Party to solve the most complex and difficult tasks in an organized manner, according to a unified plan, and at the same time maximizing the initiative and activism of each individual party member in any corner of the vast land. Lenin's famous principle that every party member is responsible to the Party is embodied in the obligations of Communist Party members and the rights prescribed to them. The Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union consolidates and develops the organizational principles of our Party, and is a powerful tool for further enhancing the initiative of party members and strengthening the Party's collective leadership.

    The collectivity of leadership is guaranteed by all the systems of inner-party life stipulated by the Party Constitution. Strictly adhering to the requirements of the Party Constitution regarding the election of Party organs and regular reporting of work is one of the most important conditions for thoroughly implementing the principle of collectivity.
    The Party Constitution states that the highest leading organ of each party organization is the membership meeting (for primary organizations), the representative conference (for example, for district organizations, state organizations), and the congress (for the Communist Party of the Union Republics and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union).
    The plenary session of the membership meeting, the representative conference, or the congress elects a standing committee or a committee, which is their executive organ, and leads all the day-to-day work of the organization. The clauses of the Party Constitution regarding the highest organs and executive organs of party organizations emphasize that: Communist Party members, party members are the masters of the Party, and without their active participation in the work of the Party and party organizations, the Party's collective leadership is inconceivable.
    The election of Party organs and regular work reports, as well as the regular convening of membership meetings, representative conferences, and congresses of primary party organizations, are necessary conditions for party members to actively participate in leadership and effectively supervise the work of Party organs. At membership meetings, representative conferences, and congresses, Communist Party members examine their leaders, listen to their work reports, criticize shortcomings, and ultimately elect or not elect this or that leader to participate in leading organs. This enhances the activism of party members, strengthens the sense of responsibility of Party organs to party members, and enhances the combat effectiveness of the entire party organization.
    The Party Constitution stipulates a certain period for convening Party Congresses, representative conferences, and membership meetings. For example, the representative conference of a state, frontier region should be convened once every year and a half, the representative conference of a city, district party committee should be convened at least once every year, and the membership meeting of a primary organization should be convened at least once a month. The Party requires all party organizations to strictly adhere to these deadlines. The facts that currently exist that violate these deadlines, that is, delays in convening congresses, representative conferences, and membership meetings, are intolerable. Because it damages the rights of party members as masters of the Party, weakens their supervision of the activities of Party organs, and undermines the collective leadership. The fact that party committees themselves supplement members, which has not yet been completely eradicated, is a serious violation of Lenin's principles of Party leadership. The practice of party committees supplementing their own members effectively abolishes the principle of elections, because party members are effectively deprived of the right to nominate and discuss candidates for Party organs, and to criticize and dismiss candidates with whom they do not agree. Workers who are supplemented into Party organs by the party committee itself do not feel a full sense of responsibility to party members. Experience has proven that this often leads to the following egregious facts: Workers place themselves above party members, do not listen to their opinions and criticisms, and begin not as a political leader, but soon become a bad administrative manager. Naturally, it is impossible to talk about genuine collective leadership under such circumstances.
    It should be concluded from the above that the prestige of the Party's leadership directly depends on the Party committee's ability to rely on the broad masses of party members in its daily practice, to use their initiative, and to promote their activism. The powers of the Party committee are significant; the committee leads the activities of the Party organization within the corresponding district, city, state, region, republic, ensures the resolute implementation of the Party's instructions, ensures the development of criticism and self-criticism and educates Communist Party members in a spirit of irreconcilability to shortcomings, organizes Party members and probationary members to study Marxism-Leninism, leads the work of carrying out communist education for laborers, appoints the editorial departments of Party newspapers and supervises their work, and guides the activities of these organizations through the Party groups in the corresponding Soviet organizations and social organizations.
    Only when the members of the Party committee (regardless of their position) are aware of their responsibility to the party members who elected them, interact with them, report their work to them, and carefully listen to the opinions of Communist Party members, can the Party committee live up to the trust of the party organization and be competent for tasks in all aspects. The issue lies in the ability of leaders to value the opinions and suggestions of the Party collective, to bravely listen to criticism from below, and to eliminate the errors and shortcomings pointed out by Communist Party members and non-Party members. When leaders sincerely treat criticism and criticism from below not from a formal perspective but from the interests of the cause, they themselves will strive to discover weaknesses in their work, and therefore will not evade criticism, but rather seek criticism, raise the vigilance of the masses, sharpen their attention to shortcomings, create convenient conditions for correcting errors, and erect insurmountable obstacles to the sabotage activities of hostile elements.
    If the Party committee itself conducts activities like a well-organized collective, where there are no passive bystanders, and every member works creatively, with a high sense of responsibility not only for the part of the work entrusted to them but also for all the activities of the Party committee, then the Party committee can rely on the collective wisdom of Communist Party members and non-Party members, and can lead closely connected with them and working in concert with them. The greater the contribution that the members of the Party committee can bring to the leadership activities of the committee, the greater the extent to which this contribution depends on the degree of the committee members' connection to Communist Party members, how much attention they pay to their requirements, and the depth to which they study the experience accumulated by party members, then the more they will not disappoint the trust of the Party collective. Weakening contact with the masses will inevitably impoverish the content of the Party committee's work and lower the level of Party leadership. The strength of collective leadership is due to the fact that it relies not only on the personal experience of the leaders, but also on the richest collective experience of the party members.
    Therefore, naturally, the principle of collective leadership excludes individual decisions made by any leader. These decisions are bad because they can neither take into account the personal experience of all members of the committee, nor the collective experience of the party organization.
    Stalin explained in a conversation with the German writer Emil Ludwig why problems cannot be decided individually. He said, "The decision of one person is always or almost always a one-sided decision. In every committee, in every collective organization, there are people who can express valuable opinions. In every committee, in every organization, there are people who can express wrong opinions. Based on the experience of three revolutions, we know that of a hundred individual decisions that have not been collectively reviewed and collectively revised, almost ninety are one-sided." (Stalin's Complete Works, Volume 13, page 107)
    Collective leadership is that all Party committee members, without exception, put their knowledge, creativity, and experience into the collective cause. Participating in the Party committee are outstanding and politically mature party members working in various departments: leaders of industrial enterprises, collective farms and machine tractor stations, excellent propagandists, agitators and organizational workers, advanced figures in factories and collective farm field work, representatives of the Soviet Army and Navy, and workers in science, literature and art. Under genuine collective leadership of the Party, every member has full possibility to freely express their disagreement with some opinion, correct the mistakes of individuals, and provide their own experience. This enables the experience of the majority to be taken into account and problems to be solved correctly and scientifically.
    In order to realize collective leadership, it is necessary to abide by the requirements of the Party Constitution regarding the time limits for convening plenary sessions of Party committees. The plenary session is the highest leading organ in the period between Party Congresses or representative conferences, it discusses and decides the main problems facing the Party organization, gives the necessary instructions to the standing committee, puts forward new tasks, and checks the implementation of Party resolutions. It is known that the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union stipulated a greater number of times for convening plenary sessions of Party committees, starting from the fact that the leadership of local Party organs must be close to the life of the Party organization. According to the provisions of the Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the plenary sessions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Union Republics, the regional committees, and the state committees are now convened at least every two months (instead of three months before the 19th Congress), and the plenary sessions of the city committees and district committees are convened at least every month (instead of every month and a half).
    Practice has proven that the new deadlines for convening plenary sessions in many party organizations can enhance the role and initiative of Party committee members in solving the tasks facing the Party organization, can promote the further development of inner-party democracy, promote the development of self-criticism and criticism from below, and strengthen supervision of the implementation of the Party's instructions and the resolutions of local Party organizations.
    If the plenary session of the Party committee is conducted with the active participation of the Party committee members, then it is a vivid embodiment of collective leadership. Under the circumstance of abiding by inner-party democracy, courageous and serious self-criticism and criticism from below will be unfolded at the plenary session, every member will be able to express any critical opinion, point out the shortcomings and errors of any leader (no matter who is involved), and put forward their own suggestions. Under these circumstances of creatively discussing and resolving current tasks in Party and economic work, the work of training leading cadres of the Communist Party and the Soviet state will be able to be carried out more smoothly.
    Since the 19th Party Congress, the plenary sessions of Party committees in most organizations have been convened according to the deadlines stipulated in the Party Constitution, and the issues of Party organizational work and ideological work have been discussed more frequently at the plenary sessions. However, in some organizations there are still phenomena that allow for the reduction of the role of Party committees as collective leadership organs. For example, in Turinsk State, four district party committees held only one plenary session between April and mid-June of this year, while Shafonovsk district committee held only two plenary sessions in half a year. The Belaokonsk and Dastarsk district party committees of Azerbaijan did not hold a single plenary session between April and mid-June of this year. There are also such facts in other states and regions. What kind of collective leadership can be talked about if even the plenary sessions of Party committees are convened so infrequently and only occasionally! The principled significance of convening the plenary sessions of Party committees more frequently and regularly lies in: turning the Party committee into a regular action collective leadership organ, guaranteeing the pragmatism and specificity of its work.
    The phenomenon of neglecting the role of Party committees often occurs in places where the Party committee secretaries do not understand the organizational principles of the Party, they issue orders themselves, use administrative management methods, and forget that the bad methods of deciding issues personally will inevitably produce big errors, will become detached from the masses, and forget the interests of the laborers. In this situation, the plenary sessions of the committee are only held as a formality, in order to report to the higher-level organs that they have abided by the requirements of the Party Constitution. The preparation work for the plenary session is often only carried out by the strength of an office department (部) of the Party organ, without absorbing the Party committee members to participate in this work; it is common for it to be predetermined who should speak at the plenary session; the staff of the office department is assigned by the secretary of the committee to prepare draft speeches on this or that issue. At the plenary session, the report is read, the achievements are praised, and the shortcomings and errors are glossed over; those who speak in the discussion are actually making their own reports. This kind of fact will limit criticism from below and lower the political significance of the plenary session.
    Sometimes there are such situations: During the discussion process, the members of the Standing Committee interrupt the speakers with multiple rebuttals, disrupt their issues, and prevent the members of the committee from expressing their critical opinions and suggestions. For example, at the plenary session of the Omsk State Committee in February of this year, Comrade Levedev, the secretary of the State Committee, interrupted the comrades speaking in the discussion many times with rebuttals. These rebuttals were often expressed in an administrative tone, in a commanding manner.
    This method of leadership, needless to say, cannot help develop self-criticism and criticism from below and collective discussion of issues. It should be understood: at the plenary session, the members of the Party committee, without exception (including the secretary), enjoy equal rights, and no one can infringe upon this right. Moreover, the position of the Party committee secretary obligates him to pay special attention to every opinion of the members, to strive to encourage and support criticism from local workers, so as to expose and eliminate errors and shortcomings.
    However, there are still leaders of some party organizations who mistakenly believe that their prestige in the organization is naturally obtained from their position; knowledge, ability, diligence, and the ability to listen to the opinions of others seem to be secondary qualities to these workers. These leaders often commit the fault of arrogance and have the bad habit of not responding to the critical opinions of the members of the committee. They believe that it is possible not to express an opinion on this or that issue during the plenary session discussion, but to give a general "directional" speech on the tasks of the Party organization at the close of the plenary session – as a kind of instruction. Under such circumstances, the Party committee members do not have the possibility to express their opinion on the correctness of the Party committee secretary's acceptance of their criticism; if the Party committee secretary is wrong, there is no possibility to correct him; there is no possibility to protect oneself from unjust accusations; and there is no possibility to evaluate the secretary's attitude in the resolution. The secretary, who holds the final evaluation of the work of the plenary session and the speeches of the Party committee members, consciously or unconsciously places himself above the plenary session and opposes his personal prestige to the prestige of the entire Party committee as a collective leadership organ.
    The role of the Party committee, as a Party leadership organ, is diminished because too many party, Soviet and economic workers who are not Party committee members are sometimes invited to participate in the plenary session of the leadership to discuss economic matters. At the plenary session of the Primorsky Regional Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in December 1952, only four of the twelve people who spoke during the discussion of the report were members of the Regional Committee of the Party. Even sometimes, the majority of the members of the committee that drafted the plenary session resolutions were not members of the Party committee who were elected, but rather people who were invited to participate in the meeting. As a result, the Party committee members were dissolved into the invited masses, and the plenary session became a general meeting under the standing committee.
    Under these circumstances, naturally, there cannot be a serious, comprehensive discussion of issues by the Party committee members at the plenary session, there cannot be a careful consideration of all the "pros" and "cons" and a critical analysis of the work of the standing committee and the Party committee secretary. In this situation, the plenary session does not become a review meeting to show off achievements, or, in seriously backward districts and states, it becomes a meeting to "boost" the Party's activists.
    The lower-level Party organizations, the standing committees, and the Party committee secretaries must implement the resolutions of the Party committee. The mission of the standing committee, the secretary, and the office department of the Party committee is to persistently ensure that these resolutions are implemented and to supervise the implementation of the resolutions. Many Party committees have begun to listen to the standing committee's reports on how the resolutions of the previous plenary session were implemented at their plenary sessions. This beneficial measure will activate the Party committee members and enhance the role of the committee as a collective leadership organ.
    The influence that the plenary session has on the life and work of the Party organization in ideological education and organization depends decisively on the standing committee of the committee. First of all, the regular convening of the plenary session is directly determined by the standing committee, which prepares the suggestions regarding the agenda and proposes the speakers. But the matter is not only about this. Usually, the work style and work methods of the standing committee are also reproduced in the activities of the committee plenary session. The level of criticism and self-criticism at the plenary session and the pragmatism and specificity of the resolutions adopted depend to a large extent on how the work of the standing committee is arranged. If the standing committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Union Republics, the regional committee, the state committee, the city committee or the district committee truly and consistently conducts criticism and self-criticism (regardless of who is involved), then this will positively influence the work of the plenary session. And this is very clear: a standing committee and a Party committee secretary who work collectively are following democratic principles. When preparing the plenary session, they absorb the committee members to participate in preparing the issues, care about making the report have a self-critical spirit, encourage criticism from below, and take effective measures to correct the shortcomings pointed out by the speakers in the discussion. The collectivity in the work of the standing committee is the key to timely exposing shortcomings based on a comprehensive and careful estimation of the situation of Party and economic work in close connection with the masses, is the key to eliminating errors in their infancy, and to formulating and implementing measures to ensure the realization of the Party and state's policies.
    Given that the standing committee of the committee leads all the work of the Party organization in the period between the plenary sessions, and that it is an important business agency that regularly embodies the entire committee, the conditions for guaranteeing the collectivity of the work of the standing committee should be discussed in more detail. Enhancing the sense of responsibility of the standing committee members for performing their tasks is one of these conditions. It is extremely obvious that all standing committee members, without exception, must be responsible to the plenary session for their work and are obliged to report their work to the plenary session. A high sense of collective responsibility to the Party often helps workers strictly obey the interests of the Party, firmly stand on a principled position, consistently and unyieldingly adhere to the Party's line, and bravely criticize erroneous views—no matter who expresses these erroneous views. It is precisely under the conditions that the standing committee members have a high sense of responsibility to party members and conduct selfless mutual criticism that they are able to collectively formulate resolutions on the most complex issues of the Party's political work and economic work.
    However, it is still possible to encounter such things: The standing committee members forget their responsibility to the Party committee and to the Party organization; at the standing committee meetings, at the plenary sessions, and in the practice of the daily work entrusted to them, they only care about making sure to echo the Party committee secretary. This is an egregious behavior: Under these circumstances, the standing committee members dare not express their own opinions, even if they believe deep down that the Party committee secretary's views are incorrect. Although the resolution is unanimously passed under these circumstances, this "unanimity" has nothing in common with collectivity, because it is not achieved on a principled basis, and it does not express the opinion of the entire leadership collective. Unanimity is only superficial here, in fact, individual leadership is used to cover it up, and individual leadership runs counter to the essence of the Communist Party.
    Of course, the Party committee secretary, especially the first secretary, bears a high degree of responsibility and a major task for leading the daily work of the Party organ. And another point is also clear: It is only because the first secretary is good at most correctly considering and applying the experience, knowledge, creativity, and all valuable suggestions of the standing committee, the Party committee, the broad masses of party members, and non-Party laborers for the interests of the Party, that is, because he accepts the method of collective leadership, that he is an authoritative leader of the Party organization.
    Life has proven that the attempt by individual Party committee secretaries to build all the work of the standing committee on the principle of one-man leadership inevitably damages the prestige of the Party's leaders and causes errors in economic work and political work. This is particularly evident in the example of the Azerbaijan Party organization. It was pointed out in the joint plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan and the Baku City Party Committee, which summarized the July Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union: In the practice of the work of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan and the Baku City Party Committee, the principle of collective leadership was undermined by their standing committees and secretaries. For a long period of time, the former first secretary of the Central Committee, Bagirov, formed an egregious leadership style here, he replaced the Party's leadership methods with crude administrative management methods, infringed on the rights of the members of the Central Committee and the standing committee, did not allow even the slightest criticism of his work, ignored the suggestions of the members of the standing committee of the Central Committee, and decided the most important issues personally.
    It should be pointed out that the fault of the members of the standing committee of the Azerbaijan Central Committee, as members of the leadership group, lies in: their long-term obedience, silence, failure to criticize the egregious facts of the administrative management methods of the first secretary of the Central Committee, failure to demonstrate the Bolshevik principle spirit, and therefore deepened the errors in leading political work and economic work. Under these circumstances, the members of the standing committee of the Central Committee obviously violated the requirements of the Party Constitution that every party member should irreconcilably expose shortcomings in work and report shortcomings in work to the Party's leading organs up to the Party's Central Committee (no matter who the report involves). Party members have no right to conceal unsatisfactory situations and not to intervene in incorrect actions that harm the interests of the Party and the state. The Communist Party member who is convinced of his correctness should not cater to any opinion and act according to what his reason and Party conscience prompt him to do. If his words and actions conform to the interests and resolutions of the Party, no one and nothing can push him off the correct path.
    Only under the conditions that the supervision from above and the supervision from below are closely combined, only under the conditions that the group led by this or that leader does not regard itself as a group of obedient puppets, but regards itself as a fighting, principled collective that is able to safeguard the interests of the Party and timely stop the leader's ultra vires, harmful, and erroneous actions, can the errors and shortcomings in the activities of this leader be exposed and eliminated in a timely and thorough manner.
    Sometimes the collectivity in the work of the standing committee is undermined because the meetings of the standing committee are held with only two or three members of the standing committee present. There are also such situations that all the members of the standing committee are present, but they cannot participate in the discussion of the issue because they have not received the necessary documents and draft resolutions in a timely manner. Only by carefully preparing the standing committee meetings can the effective, collective work of the standing committee be guaranteed.
    The secretariat, which is established in the state, regional committees, and the central committee of the communist party of the Union Republics to handle daily problems and check the implementation of resolutions in accordance with the Party Constitution, is an important link in collective leadership. It is known that our Party attaches great significance to correctly arranging the inspection of the implementation of resolutions. It is also known that there are no small matters in the work of the Party, and since the secretariat is responsible for handling this or that daily problem in the life of the Party, then these problems should be resolved not hastily but through serious and concrete discussions.
    Therefore, the phenomenon that the secretariat passes resolutions by soliciting opinions is intolerable. The secretariat, as already mentioned, was established to handle daily problems, and only a lack of attention to these daily problems can explain their preference for decisions in absentia. The secretariat of the Novgorod Regional Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union passed a decision on the program of the Novgorod State Theater in 1953 by consulting opinions. There is no need to prove that deciding this important issue of ideological work requires exchanging opinions, studying the essence of the matter, and considering all aspects of the theater's program orientation.
    The fact that the secretariat's work forgets collectivity is also manifested in the fact that in some Party organizations, the secretariat's meetings are sometimes held with only one secretary present. He listens to the reports of these or those workers in accordance with the agenda and passes individual resolutions. And these individual resolutions are called resolutions of the secretariat for some unknown reason.
    In many cases, the secretariat replaces the standing committee of the committee and takes on itself the responsibility of solving major issues such as reviewing the personal materials of party members and probationary members and passing the resolutions of the state committee and the state executive committee. The secretariat of the Bashkir State Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union for a time even approved the work plan of the standing committee of the Party committee, thus placing itself above the standing committee. Similar situations have been discovered in those places where supervision of the secretariat's work by the standing committee is weak. It is important to have the secretariat report the resolutions they have passed to the standing committee of the Party committee as required by the Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The phenomenon of lack of supervision cannot be tolerated, it will seriously undermine collectivity, especially it will expand the role of the secretariat and reduce the role of the standing committee.
    For the sake of genuine collective leadership, it is extremely important that the boundaries between the Party committee elected by the membership meeting, the representative conference, or the congress and the departments under its supervision are not allowed to be obliterated. There are such situations that the departments of certain state committees send some investigation materials and the inspectors' reports on the results of the inspection of the work of individual departments of the district committee to the district committee without the approval of the standing committee of the state committee; these investigation materials and reports make evaluations of the activities of the Party organization and instructions for correcting shortcomings. In this way, the office organ seizes the powers of the Party committee, and the departments become leading organs that act independently from the state committee.
    Of course, the work of the departments is quite large: They lead the practical work of implementing the Party's resolutions, selecting cadres, and checking the implementation, but they themselves do not have the right to lead local organizations. The office organ of the Party organ seizes the leadership powers that do not belong to it, which will push the members of the Party committee out of the leadership work and will reduce the role of the Party committee as a collective leadership organ. Obviously, the departments' "instructions" have no legal effect in the eyes of the Party organization, because these instructions are not issued from the elected organ that enjoys the trust of the Party organization, but are issued from its office organ.
    This distorted phenomenon often occurs in situations where the Party committee does not conduct activities like an elected organ that is obligated to report work but like an administrative command organ. In those places where the leadership of local organizations has become individual commands and the supervision from below of the Party committee's work has been weakened, the staff of the office organ will develop an incorrect and harmful view, as if the office organ, that is, the departments of the Party committee, also has the right to issue instructions to the lower-level Party organizations.
    The meetings of Party activists are indispensable means of attracting the Party's excellent forces to participate in the Party's leadership. The Party's activists are the direct implementers of the Party's resolutions, and they are closely connected with party members and all laborers, and they are able to express the opinion within the Party organization deeply and faithfully. Activists have experience in all aspects of political work, economic work, and cultural work. Using these rich experiences to improve the Party's work is one of the important tasks of the Party's leadership. The meetings of Party activists are for this purpose; the meetings of Party activists provide the possibility of adopting the experience of the activists, adopting their criticisms, and suggestions for improving work. The meetings of activists are schools for training new cadres of Party work.
    The new Party Constitution expanded the scope of convening meetings of activists, and, as stipulated in the Party Constitution, the convening of meetings of activists should not be for show, to formally and ceremonially agree to the resolutions of the Party and the government, but to truly discuss these resolutions. Wherever the meetings of activists actually become a forum for bold and sharp criticism of the shortcomings of the work of Party organs, become a means of exchanging experiences and solving political and economic tasks, and wherever these criticisms and experiences receive the attention of the Party organization, the Party's collective leadership will be strengthened, and the leadership itself will be more practical and effective.
    The regularity of convening meetings of Party activists is a reliable sign of the degree to which the Party organ cares about adopting the experience of the activists. Recently, meetings have been held more regularly in cities and districts than before. However, many district party committees and city party committees still rarely convene meetings of activists and do not attach importance to its significance for improving the level of Party leadership. In the first three months of 1953, about 40% of rural district committees and 20% of city committees did not hold any meetings of activists at all. And things have not improved much in the following months. In Kalinin, Kursk, Stalingrad, and some other states, there are also many district committees that have not convened meetings of activists. For example, in Stalingrad State, thirty-four district committees did not hold meetings of activists from April to mid-June of this year. Among them, twenty-six district committees had not convened meetings of activists for the entire half-year period

    领导的集体性是党的领导的最高原则
    苏联  雅科夫列夫
    由于苏联共产党——苏维埃社会的领导力量——严格地遵守着伟大的列宁所制订的党的领导原则和党内生活准则，所以，它在为在苏联建设共产主义的斗争中获得了新的胜利。这些原则和准则规定：要最严格地遵守党章的要求，彻底实现民主集中制的原理，尽力发扬普通党员的积极性，以及集体讨论党的生活中的重要问题。如列宁所教导的，只有在严格遵守集体领导原则的条件下，党组织和全党的正常活动才成为可能。集体领导的原则保证党在通过的决议中避免偶然性和片面性。党的领导的力量就在于集体性、团结性和一致性。集体性是我们党内的最高领导原则。制订正确的党的政策和胜利地在实践中实现这些政策直接有赖于遵守这一原则。
    党的集体领导原则是完全符合马克思列宁主义关于个人崇拜的危害和不可容许的著名原理的。个人崇拜引导至轻视党及其领导核心的作用，引导至降低党员群众和苏联人民的创造积极性，它与马克思列宁主义对领导机关和领导者的指导性活动的巨大意义的理解是无共同之处的。只有以马列主义理论的科学原理和领导干部的广泛主动性为依据的党中央委员会的集体经验和集体智慧，才能保证对党和国家的正确领导，保证党的队伍的不可动摇的团结一致，保证在我国顺利地建设共产主义。
    遵守党内生活的牢固准则，遵守集体领导的原则，是进一步巩固党的队伍在思想和组织上的团结及加强党组织的战斗力的最重要先决条件之一。当全党（从上到下）在开展起来的批评和自下而上的批评的基础上集体讨论和决定问题的时候，——在这样的条件下，就会有可能揭发和消除工作中的缺点和对党的政策的歪曲，及时揭发党和人民的敌人的阴谋诡计。集体领导便于培养干部和把我们党内蕴藏的新的创造力量提拔到领导中来。集体性是对干部，对任何一个工作者（不管他的职位多高）的活动实行真正的党的监督的必要条件，是以忠于党和国家利益的精神教育工作者的必要条件。实践证明，没有集体性的原则，就会产生对个别工作者的无监督现象，就会引导至用个人命令偷偷代替集体制订的决议，引导至无根据地、片面地决定问题，以及废除批评与自下而上的批评。这就为大的错误和歪曲创造了沃土，会大大地损害党和国家的利益。
    苏联共产党中央委员会七月全会重新强调指出了党的领导原则的重大的现实意义。中央委员会全会指出，——作为党组织的最重要任务之一，就是必须全力加强党在党的机关和国家机关的一切环节中的领导，最严格地遵守党的集体领导原则，坚决根绝破坏这一原则的现象。
    党的领导的集体性是寓于共产党是民主的政党，是思想一致的共产主义者的自愿的战斗联盟这
    一本质中。列宁在解释党的民主制时指出，在一个按民主制组织起来的政党中，“……全体党员，具有平等权利地、毫无例外地直接或通过代表领导党的一切事业……”。（列宁全集，第十一卷，第三九六页）
    马克思列宁主义教导我们，共产党是工人阶级的独立的战斗组织，它积极地思考，生气勃勃地生活，破坏旧的和创造新的。有人认为，党似乎不是
    一个独立的机构，而是某种类似行政管理机关的综合体，在那里，有高级职员和低级职员。这种观点是极端错误的，是与马克思主义毫无共同之处的。这种有害的和危险的关于党的观点在实践中产生了党的活动中的官僚主义，党的个别领导者认为自己是“高级职员”，企图把一切工作建立在个人命令之上，不重视吸引共产党员参加党的领导，钳制他们的积极性和主动精神。党坚决铲除把党的工作官僚化的任何企图，为表现共产党员的创造力创造一切必要的条件。
    历史的经验教导我们，党员群众的高度积极性和主动性，是党的事业的不可战胜性的最深源泉之一。不论我国共产党面临什么样的任务：建立和巩固工人阶级与劳动农民的联盟，推翻资本家和地主的政权，建立和巩固无产阶级专政，在内战时期保卫苏维埃共和国免受外国干涉者和白卫分子的侵略，国家工业化，在农村建立集体农庄制度，保证苏联在一九四一—一九四五年的伟大卫国战争中的胜利，巨大的战后和平建设工作，——而这每一项任务都能够得到解决，正是由于党吸引它的全体党员积极地和自觉地来实现党的政策。
    我们的党在其全部组织活动中都遵循着民主集中制的要求，因为这一原则保证把集中制（即最严格的纪律）与发扬主动精神（即党员的积极性）结合起来。党把民主理解为提高党员群众的积极性和觉悟性，逐步地吸引他们不仅参加讨论问题，而且参加领导工作。党的组织把民主集中制的原理充分运用到自己的党内生活中，因而就为实现党的集体领导提供了必要条件。随着党内民主的发展，党机关工作中的集体性也增长起来。
    在今天的条件下，当党组织正在实现苏联共产党第十九次代表大会向我们提出的任务和实现党中央委员会与苏联政府在近几个月来拟定的一些重要措施的时候，需要党员群众更积极地参加党的领导。进一步改善国家的领导和经济的领导，巩固苏维埃国家和国防，加强各民族的兄弟般的友谊和以社会主义国际主义的精神教育劳动人民，提高苏联人民的物质和文化水平——这一切，像任何时候一样，要求彻底采用党内民主原则，即党的集体领导原则。
    因此，应当指出苏联共产党第十九次代表大会在党员义务的规定中所增加的补充条款的深刻意义。我党新党章提高了每个共产党员对党的共同事业的责任感。新党章中关于党员权利与义务的更完满的规定，说明了进一步吸收党员群众参加领导党的工作的方针。在党员的义务中明显地反映了党内民主制的最主要的特征：这是行动的民主制，使我党能够在广大国土的任何角落里有组织地、按照统
    一的计划、同时最大限度地运用每个个别党员的主动性和积极性来解决最复杂、最困难的任务。在共产党员的义务中和给他们规定的权利中，体现了列宁的以下一著名原理，即每个党员要对党负责。苏联共产党党章巩固和发展了我党的组织原则，是进
    一步提高党员群众的主动精神和加强党的集体领导的强大工具。
    ×    ×    ×
    领导的集体性是由党章规定的党内生活的一切制度所保证的。严格遵守党章关于党的机关的选举和定期报告工作的要求，是彻底执行集体性原则的最重要条件之一。
    党章中说，每个党组织的最高领导机关是党员大会（对于基层组织）、代表会议（例如，对于区的组织、州的组织）、代表大会（对于加盟共和国共产党和苏联共产党）。
    全体党员大会、代表会议或代表大会选举常务委员会或委员会，这是它们的执行机关，领导该组织的一切日常工作。党章关于党组织的最高机关和执行机关的条款强调指出：共产党员，党员群众是党的主人，没有他们积极参加党和党组织的工作，党的领导的集体性是不可思议的。
    党机关的选举和定期工作报告及按正规召开基层党组织的党员大会、代表会议和代表大会，是党员群众积极参加领导和有效地监督党机关的工作的必要条件。共产党员在党员大会、代表会议和代表大会上检查自己的领导者，听取他们的工作报告，批评缺点，并在最终选举或不选举这个或那个领导者参加领导机关。这就会提高党员的积极性，加强党的机关对党员群众的责任感，提高整个党组织的战斗力。
    党章规定了召开党代表大会、代表会议和党员大会的一定期限。例如，州、边疆区的代表会议应当每一年半召开一次，市、区党代表会议至少每一年召集一次，基层组织的党员大会至少每月召开一次。党要求一切党组织严格遵守这些期限。现在存在的破坏这些期限的事实，即对召开代表大会、代表会议和党员大会的拖延，是不可容忍的。因为它损害党员作为党的主人的权利，削弱他们对党机关的活动的监督，破坏领导的集体性。尚未彻底根除的党委会自己补充委员的事实，是对列宁的党的领导原则的严重破坏。党委会自己补充委员的作法事实上取消了选举的原则，因为党员实际被剥夺了提出和讨论党机关的候选人以及批评和撤消不能同意的候选人的权利。被党委会自己补充在党机关中的工作者感觉不到对党员群众有充分的责任感。经验证明，这常常会引起这种恶劣的事实：工作者把自己放在党员群众之上，不听取他们的意见和批评，开始时不像一个政治领导者，而很快就成了一个坏的行政管理者了。自然，在这样的情况下不可能谈到真正的集体领导。
    从以上所说的应该得出结论：党的领导的威信直接有赖于党的委员会善于在其日常实践中依靠广大党员群众，运用他们的主动性，发扬他们的积极性。党的委员会的职权是重大的；委员会在相应的区、市、州、边疆区、共和国的范围内领导党组织的活动，保证坚决执行党的指示，保证开展批评与自我批评并以对缺点不调和的精神教育共产党员，组织党员和候补党员研究马克思列宁主义，领导对劳动者进行共产主义教育的工作，委任党机关报的编辑部并监督其工作，通过相应的苏维埃组织和社会组织中的党组指导这些组织的活动。
    只有在党委会的委员们（不管他们是什么职位）自觉到自己对选举他们的党员群众的责任，同他们交往，向他们报告工作，仔细倾听共产党员的意见的情况下，党的委员会才能不负党组织的信任，才能胜任各方面的任务。问题在于领导者要能重视党的集体的意见和建议，勇敢地倾听来自下面的批评，消灭共产党员和非党员指出的错误和缺点。当领导者不是从形式上着眼而是从事业的利益出发忠诚地对待批评和来自下面的批评时，他自己将力求发现工作中的弱点，因之就不逃避批评，而是寻求批评，提高群众的警惕性，使他们对缺点的注意敏锐起来，为纠正错误创造便利条件，为敌对分子的破坏活动树立不可克服的障碍。
    如果党的委员会本身像一个组织得很好的集体那样进行活动，在那里没有消极的旁观者，每一个委员都创造性地进行工作，不仅对委托给他的那一部分工作而且对党的委员会的全部活动具有高度的责任感的话，党委会就能够依靠共产党员和非党员的集体智慧，就能够紧密地联系着他们与他们协同动作地来进行领导。党委会的委员们越能给委员会的领导活动带来大的贡献，这种贡献的大小在很大的程度上决定于委员会的委员们联系共产党员的程度如何，对他们的要求注意得怎样，深入研究党员群众积累的经验的深度如何，那末就越不负党的集体的信任。削弱与群众的联系必然会使党委会的工作内容贫乏，使党的领导水平降低。集体领导之所以有力量，是由于它不仅依靠领导者的个人经验，而且依靠党员群众的最丰富的集体经验。
    因此，自然，集体领导的原则是排斥任何一个领导者所作的个人决定的。这些决定是坏的，因为它们既不可能顾及委员会全体委员的个人经验，也不可能顾及党组织的集体经验。
    斯大林在与德国作家爱米尔·路德委赫的谈话中解释过为什么不能个人决定问题。他说，“一个人的决定，从来是或者几乎从来是片面的决定。在每个委员会里，在每个集体组织里，都有发表值得重视的意见的人。在每个委员会里，在每个组织里，都有能发表错误意见的人。根据三次革命的经验，我们知道：在一百个未经过集体审查和集体修改的个人决定中，差不多有九十个是片面的”。（斯大林全集第十三卷，第一○七页）
    集体领导就是，全体党委会的委员无一例外地都把自己的知识、创造和经验放入集体的事业中去。参加到党委会中的有在各个不同部门工作的优秀的、政治上最成熟的党员：工业企业、集体农庄和机器拖拉机站的领导者，优秀的宣传家、鼓动家和组织工作者，工厂和集体农庄田野工作中的先进人物，苏联陆军和海军的代表，科学、文学和艺术工作者。在党的真正集体领导的情况下，每一个委员都有充分可能自由地表示自己不赞成某种意见，纠正个别人的错误，提供自己的经验。这就能顾及大多数人的经验正确地、科学地解决问题。
    为了实现集体领导，必须遵守党章关于召集党委会全体会议的期限的要求。全体会议是各次党代表会议或代表大会之间的期间的最高领导机关，它讨论和决定党组织面临的主要问题，给常务委员会以必要的指示，提出新的任务，检查党的决议的执行情况。大家知道，苏联共产党第十九次代表大会从地方党机关的领导必须接近党组织的生活出发，规定了召开党委会全会的更多的次数。按照苏联共产党党章的规定，加盟共和国共产党中央委员会、边疆区委员会、州委员会的全会现在至少两个月（代替了十九次代表大会前的三个月）召集一次，市委会和区委会的全会至少每一个月（代替了一个半月）召集一次。
    实践已经证明，在许多党组织中，召集全会的新期限能够提高党委会委员在解决党组织面临的任务中所起的作用和积极性，能够促进党内民主的进一步发展，促进自我批评和自下而上的批评的开展，以及加强对党的指示和地方党组织的决议的执行情况的监督。
    如果党委会的全体会议是在党委委员的积极参加下进行的，那末，它就是集体领导的生动的体现。在遵守党内民主制的情况下，在全会上将展开勇敢的、认真的自我批评和自下而上的批评，每一个委员都能够发表任何批评意见，指出任何领导者的缺点和错误（不管牵涉到什么人），提出自己的建议。在这种创造性地讨论和解决党和经济工作方面的当前任务的情况下，培养共产党和苏维埃国家的领导干部的工作将能更顺利地进行。
    在第十九次党代表大会以后，大多数组织中的党委会全会是按党章规定的期限召开的，在全会上更经常地讨论党的组织工作和思想工作的问题。然而，在某些组织中仍然有容许缩小作为集体领导机关的党委会的作用的现象。例如，在土里斯克州，有四个区党委会在今年四月至六月中只召开了一次全会，而沙弗诺夫斯克区委会在半年内只开过两次全会。阿塞拜疆的别劳康斯克和达斯塔尔斯克区党委会在今年四月至六月中没有召开一次全会。在其他州和边疆区也有这种事实。如果连党委会全会都很少召开和偶然才召开的话，还谈得上什么领导的集体性！更经常地和正规地召开党委会全会的原则性的意义在于：把党委会变成经常行动的集体领导机关，保证其工作的务实性和具体性。
    轻视党委会的作用的现象常常发生在党委书记不理解党的组织原则的地方，他们自己发号施令，使用行政管理方法，忘记了个人决定问题的恶劣方法必然会产生大的错误，会脱离群众和忘记劳动者的利益。在这种情况下，委员会的全体会议只是作为形式举行的，为的是向上级机关报告他们遵守了党章的要求。全会的准备工作常常只是由党机关的一个办公机构（部）的力量来进行，而不吸收党委会委员们来参与这项工作；预先决定谁应该在全会上发言的事是常有的；办公机构的工作人员按照委员会的书记的指示委派个别工作者准备这个或那个问题的发言草稿。在全会上宣读报告，歌颂成绩，粉饰缺点和错误；在讨论中发言的人实际上是作自己的报告。这种事实会限制来自下面的批评，降低全会的政治意义。
    有时有这样的情形：在讨论过程中常委委员用多次的抗辩打断发言人，搅乱他们的问题，妨碍委员会的委员们发表自己的批评意见和建议。例如，在今年二月奥姆斯克州委会的全会上，州委书记列别捷夫同志曾许多次用抗辩打断在讨论中发言的同志。这种反驳意见往往是用行政语调、命令的方式发表的。
    这种领导方法，不用说，是不能帮助开展自下而上的批评和集体讨论问题的。应当懂得：在全会上，党委委员一无例外地（书记也不例外）享有同等的权利，谁也不能侵犯这种权利。而且，党委会书记的地位使他有义务特别注意委员们的每一种意见，尽力鼓励和支持来自地方工作者的批评，以便揭发和消灭错误与缺点。
    可是，现在还有一些党组织的领导人错误地认为，他们在组织中的威信是自然而然地由他们职务上的地位而得到的；知识、能力、勤劳、善于倾听他人的意见在这些工作者看来是次要的品质。这些领导者常常犯自矜的毛病，有不回答委员会委员们的批评意见的坏习惯。他们认为可以不在全会的讨论过程中发表关于这个或那个问题的意见，而在全会闭幕时发表关于党组织的任务的一般“方针性的”演说——作为某种指示。在这种情况下，党委委员们便没有可能发表他们对党委书记接受他们的批评的正确程度如何的意见；如果党委书记错了，就没有可能去纠正他；没有可能保护自己不受不公正的责难；也没有可能在决议中对书记的态度给予评价。握有最终评价全会工作和党委委员们的发言的全权的书记，自觉不自觉地把自己放在全会之上，把自己个人的威望和作为集体领导机关的整个党委会的威信对立起来。
    因为有时邀请了过多的，不是党委委员的党、苏维埃和经济工作者参加讨论领导经济业务问题的全会，而使作为党的领导机关的党委会的作用降低了。在一九五二年十二月苏共朴里莫尔斯克边疆区委员会的全会上，在讨论报告时发言的十二个人中只有四个是边疆区党委委员。甚至有时在拟定全会决议的委员会的成员中，当选的大多数不是党委委员，而是被邀请来参加会议的人。结果，党委委员被消溶在被邀请来的群众中，而全会变成常委会下的一般会议了。
    在这种情况下，自然在全会上不可能有党委委员们对问题的认真的、全面的讨论，不可能有对一切“赞成”和“反对”的仔细考虑及对常委会和党委书记的工作的批判分析。在这种场合，全会不是成了显示成绩的检阅会议，或者，在严重落后的区和州里，就是成了给党的活动分子“打气”的训示的会议。
    下级党组织、常委会和党委书记必须执行党委会的决议。常委会、书记和党委会的办公机构的使命是要坚持地使这些决议得到实现，监督决议的执行。许多党委会已开始在它们的全体会议上听取常委会关于如何执行上届全会决议的报告。这种有益的措施会使党委会委员积极起来，提高作为集体领导机关的委员会的作用。
    全体会议在思想教育和组织方面给予党组织的生活和工作的影响，决定性地有赖于委员会的常务委员会。首先，正规地召开全会是直接决定于常委会的，常委会准备关于议事日程的建议，提出报告人。而事情还不仅在于此。通常，常委会的工作作风和工作方法也再现于委员会全会的活动中。全会上的批评与自我批评的水平和通过的决议的求实精神和具体性等在很大程度上取决于常委会的工作是怎样安排的。如果苏共加盟共和国中央委员会、边疆区、州、市或区委员会的常委会真是一贯地进行批评与自我批评（不管牵涉到什么人），那末，这将积极影响全会的工作。而这是很明显的：集体地进行工作的常委会和党委书记是遵循民主的原则的。在准备全会时，他们吸收委员会的委员们参加准备问题，关心使报告具有自我批评精神，鼓励来自下面的批评，采取有效的措施纠正在讨论中发言人指出的缺点。常委会工作中的集体性，是在全面和仔细估计党和经济工作状况的基础上紧密联系群众及时揭发缺点的锁钥，是在萌芽时消灭错误，拟定和执行保证实现党和国家政策的措施的锁钥。
    由于考虑到委员会的常委会在全会之间的期间内领导着党组织的全部工作，并且它是经常体现整个委员会的重要的业务机构，所以应当更详细地讲
    一讲保证常委会工作的集体性的条件。提高常委委员们对执行他们的任务的责任感是这些条件之一。极其明显的，全体常委委员们一无例外地须把自己的工作对全会负责，并且有义务向全会报告工作。对党的集体的高度责任感常常帮助工作者严格服从党的利益，坚定地站在原则立场上，一贯地、不屈不挠地坚持党的路线，勇敢地批评错误观点——不管这些错误观点是谁发表的。正是在常委委员们对党员群众具有高度责任感和无私地进行相互批评的条件下，他们才能够集体地制订关于党的政治工作和经济工作的最复杂问题的决议。
    然而，仍然可以遇到这样的事情：常委会委员忘记了自己对党委会，对党组织的责任；在常委会会议上，在全会上，在委托给他们的日常工作的实践中，他们关心的只是一定要随声附和党委书记。这是一种恶劣的行为：在这种情况下，常委会委员们不敢发表自己的意见，即令他们在内心深处认为党委书记的观点是不正确的。虽然决议在这种情况下被一致通过了，然而这种“一致”却与集体性无共同之点，因为它不是在原则的基础上达到的，它没有表现出整个领导者集体的意见。一致在这里只是表面的，实际上，个人领导是用它掩盖起来了，个人领导是与共产党的本质背道而驰的。
    当然，党委书记，首先是第一书记，对于领导党机关的日常工作是负有高度责任和重大任务的。而另一点也是清楚的：只是由于第一书记善于为了党的利益而最正确地考虑和运用常委、党委、广大党员群众和非党劳动者的经验、知识、创造和一切有价值的建议，也就是说，由于他接受集体领导的方法，所以他才是党组织的有权威的领导者。
    生活已经证明，个别党委书记把常委会的全部工作建立在一长制原则上的企图，必然会破坏党的领导者的威信，使经济工作和政治工作发生错误。这在阿塞拜疆党组织的例子上看得特别明显。在讨论苏共中央七月全会总结的阿塞拜疆党中央委员会和巴金斯克市党委会的联合全会上指出：在阿塞拜疆党中央委员会和巴金斯克市党委会工作的实践中，集体领导的原则被它们的常委会和书记破坏了。在很长的期间内，前任中央委员会第一书记巴吉洛夫在这里形成了一种恶劣的领导作风，他用粗鲁的行政管理手段代替党的领导方法，侵犯中央委员会委员和常委们的权利，不允许那怕是稍稍批评
    一下他的工作，忽视中央委员会常委会委员们的建议，个人决定最重要的问题。
    应当指出，作为领导集团的成员的阿塞拜疆中央委员会常委会委员们的过错在于：他们长期顺从，沉默，不批评中央委员会第一书记的行政管理手段的恶劣事实，没有表现布尔什维克的原则精神，因而加深了在领导政治工作和经济工作中的错误。在这种情况下，中央委员会的常委会委员们显然破坏了党章责成每个党员应当不调和地揭发工作中的缺点并向党的领导机关直至党的中央委员会报告工作中的缺点（不管报告牵涉到什么人）的要求。党员无权隐瞒不能令人满意的情况和不过问损害党和国家利益的不正确行动。坚信自己的正确性的共产党员，应当不迎合任何意见，照他的理智和党的良心所提示的去行动。如果他的言论和行动符合党的利益和决议，没有任何人和没有任何东西能够把他从正确的道路上推开。
    只有在自上而下的监督和自下而上的监督密切结合起来的条件下，只有在被这个或那个领导者领导的集团不把自己当作一群顺从的傀儡，而把自己作为一个战斗的有原则性的集体，能够维护党的利益并及时制止领导者的越权的、有害的和错误的行动的条件下，才能适时地、彻底地揭发和消灭这个领导者的活动中的错误与缺点。
    有时因为常委会的会议是在只有二——三个常委会委员出席的情况下举行的，而使常委会工作中的集体性被破坏。也有这样的情形，全体常委会委员都出席了，但是他们不能参加问题的讨论，因为他们没有适时地得到必要的文件和决议草案。只有认真地准备常委会会议，才能保证常委会机构的有成效的、集体的工作。
    按照党章在州、边疆区委员会和加盟共和国共产党中央委员会成立的处理日常问题并检查决议执行情况的书记处，是集体领导的重要一环。大家知道，我党对于正确安排检查决议执行的情况赋与多么重大的意义。大家也知道，在党的工作中没有小事情，既然书记处负责处理党的生活中的这个或那个日常问题，那末，就应当不是草率地而是通过认真的和具体的讨论来解决这些问题。
    因此，书记处用征询意见的方法通过决议的现象是不可容忍的。书记处，如已经说过的，是为了处理日常问题而建立的，只有用对这些日常问题的不重视才能说明他们对缺席决议的偏爱。苏共诺夫高洛斯克州委书记处用征询意见的方法通过了关于一九五三年内诺夫高洛斯克州剧院上演节目的决定，毋须证明，决定这个重要的思想工作问题是需要交换意见，研究事情的实质和考虑到剧院上演节目的方针的各个方面的。
    书记处工作中忘记集体性的事实还表现在：某些党组织中，书记处的会议有时是在只有一个书记出席的情况下举行的。他按照议事日程听取这些或那些工作者的报告，通过个人的决议。而这种个人的决议不知道为什么叫做书记处的决议。
    在许多情况下，书记处代替了委员会的常委会，把解决像审查党员和候补党员的个人材料以及通过州委会和州执委会的决议等这样一些重大的问题揽在自己身上。苏共巴什基尔斯克州委会的书记处曾有一个时期甚至还批准党委常委会的工作计划，这样，它就把自己放在常委会之上了。在常委会对书记处的工作监督薄弱的那些地方，发现了类似的情形。使书记处按照苏共党章所要求的那样向党委常委会报告它们所通过的决议是件重要的事情。不能容忍无监督现象，它会严重地破坏集体性，特别是会扩大书记处的作用和缩小常委会的作用。
    为了真正的集体领导的利益，十分重要的是：不容许抹煞由党员大会、代表会议或代表大会选举出来的党委会与在它监督下的各部的界限。有这样的情形，某些州委会的各部不经过州委常委会的批准便把一些调查材料和检查区委会个别部门工作的结果的检查者的报告发到区委会去；在这些调查材料和报告中作出对党组织的活动的评价和对纠正缺点的指示。这样，办公机构就攫取了党委会的职权，各部变成了脱离州委会而独立行动的领导机关。
    当然，各部的工作是相当大的：它们领导实现党的决议的实际工作，选拔干部和检查执行情况，但是它们本身没有权利领导地方组织。党机关的办公机构攫取不属于它的领导职权，会把党委委员们从领导工作中排挤出去，会缩小作为集体领导机关的党委会的作用。显然，部的“指示”在党组织的眼中是没有什么法律效力的，因为这些指示不是从享有党组织的信任的被选举出来的机关发出的，而是从它的办公机构发出的。
    在党委会不像一个被选举的、负有报告工作义务的机关而像一个行政命令机关那样进行活动的情况下，这种歪曲的现象常常发生。在对地方组织的领导变成了个人命令而对党委会工作的自下而上的监督被削弱了的那些地方，办公机构的工作人员就会产生一种不正确的和有害的观点，好像办公机构，即党委会的各部也有权利向下级党组织发布指示。
    党的活动分子会议，是吸引党的优秀力量参加党的领导的不可缺少的手段。党的活动分子是党的决议的直接执行者，而且是与党员群众和全体劳动者紧密联系的，他们能够深刻地、忠实地表达党组织内的舆论。活动分子拥有政治工作、经济工作和文化工作的各方面的经验。运用这些丰富的经验以提高党的工作，是党的领导的重要任务之一。党的活动分子会议就是为了这个目的；活动分子会议提供采用活动分子的经验，采纳他们的批评意见和改进工作的建议的可能。活动分子会议是培养新的党的工作干部的学校。
    新党章扩大了召开活动分子会议的范围，而且，如党章中规定的，活动分子会议的召开不应是为了做做样子，在形式上和仪式上赞同党和政府的决议，而是为了真正讨论这些决议。凡是活动分子会议实际上成为大胆和尖锐批评党机关工作的缺点的讲坛，成为交流经验和解决政治和经济任务的手段的地方，凡是这些批评和经验受到党组织的注意的地方，党的集体领导就会加强，领导本身也就更切实有效。
    召开活动分子会议的正规性，是党机关对采用活动分子的经验关心的程度的可靠标志。近来，在市和区，会议比以前举行得正规了。然而，许多区党委会和市党委会仍然很少召开活动分子会议，不重视它对于提高党的领导水平的意义。在一九五三年的头三个月内，约有百分之四十的农村区委会和百分之二十的市委会完全没有举行过活动分子会议。而且在以后的几个月里事情改进得也不多。在加里宁、库尔斯克、斯大林格勒和其他一些州里，也有许多区委会没有召开活动分子会议。例如，在斯大林格勒州，有三十四个区委会在今年四月至六月中没有举行过活动分子会议。其中有二十六个区委会在整整半年期间内都没有召开活动分子会议。
    正规地召开党的活动分子会议和提高会议工作水平——这就保证了加强党的领导的一个重要条件。实际上执行集体领导原则的党的领导者不会不感觉到一种有机的需要：更经常地与活动分子接触，和他们商讨迫切的问题，得到他们的支持。没有活动分子作为支柱，要真正集体领导党组织的活动是不可思议的。
    共产党在自己半世纪的历史中积累了丰富的经验，创造了吸引党员群众和活动分子参加党的领导的多种而有效的方式方法。随着共产党员的觉悟性和积极性及党组织的战斗力的提高，产生了提高领导水平和加强集体领导的新的可能性。利用这种可能性和党组织积累起来的经验，是进一步改善党领导经济和文化建设事业的必要条件。最严格地遵守党的领导的集体性、团结性和一致性的原则，是提高党的一切工作、加强与群众的联系和胜利地解决党与人民所面临的在我国建设共产主义的任务的保证。
