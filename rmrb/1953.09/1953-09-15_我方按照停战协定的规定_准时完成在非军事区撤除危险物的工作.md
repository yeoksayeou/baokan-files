    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 13th: The Korean-Chinese side has completed the removal of known hazardous materials within our side of the Demilitarized Zone within the time stipulated by the Korean Armistice Agreement. The Armistice Agreement stipulates that this work should be completed within 45 days after the 72-hour period following the effective date of the Armistice Agreement (i.e., September 13th).
    During this period, unarmed personnel dispatched by the Korean-Chinese forces to carry out the clearing work, under the supervision of our members of the joint observer teams, removed a total of 211 known minefields from our side of the Demilitarized Zone, clearing more than 100,000 mines and other explosives. In addition, many safe roads have been cleared in the sections of each joint observer team for the joint observer teams to use when performing their duties.
    Our personnel performing the clearing work faithfully implemented the Armistice Agreement and carried out their work with a high degree of responsibility. Every day, they crossed mountains and ridges, risking their lives to search for mines and various hazardous materials in the Demilitarized Zone, and thoroughly cleared them. Their efforts ensured that the joint observer team personnel could safely perform their duties of supervising the armistice in the Demilitarized Zone, and ensured the timely completion of our work in erecting military demarcation line markers.
    The US side showed a slow and irresponsible attitude in the removal of hazardous materials. Since the agreement on the method of removing hazardous materials from the Demilitarized Zone was reached between the two sides on August 13th, the maps submitted weekly by the US side to our side showed no active progress in the removal of hazardous materials, except for the addition of some channels. As of the 11th, the US side had only removed 32 minefields, and these minefields were mainly near the Panmunjom conference area. In the sections of the fifth and tenth joint observer teams responsible by the US side, the progress of the joint observer teams' inspection of military demarcation line markers was delayed due to the incomplete removal of hazardous materials.

    我方按照停战协定的规定
    准时完成在非军事区撤除危险物的工作
    【新华社开城十三日电】朝中方面已在朝鲜停战协定所规定的时间内，将已知存在于我方非军事区内的危险物撤除完毕。停战协定规定，这项工作应在停战协定生效后七十二小时的时期终止后的四十五天内（即九月十三日）完成。
    在这个期间，朝中部队派出的担任清除工作的非武装人员，在各联合观察小组我方组员的监督下，自我方非军事区内撤除了已知地雷区共二百十一处，共清除了各种地雷及其他爆炸物十余万枚。此外，在各联合观察小组负责的地段内，都已清除出许多条安全的道路，以供联合观察小组在执行任务时使用。
    执行清除工作的我方人员忠实地执行停战协定，以高度负责的精神进行工作。他们每天翻山越岭，冒着生命危险在非军事区内搜寻地雷和各种危险物，加以彻底清除。他们的努力保证了联合观察小组人员安全地在非军事区内执行监督停战的任务，并保证了我方树立军事分界线标志物的工作及时完成。
    美方在撤除危险物的工作中表现了迟缓和不负责任的态度。从八月十三日双方达成自非军事区内撤除危险物办法的协议以后，在美方每周送交我方的地图上，除多画出了一些通道外，看不出撤除危险物的工作积极进展的情况。到十一日为止，美方仅撤除了地雷区三十二处，而这些地雷区主要的是在板门店会场区附近。在第五和第十联合观察小组美方负责的地段内，曾因撤除危险物不彻底，延缓了联合观察小组检查军事分界线标志物工作的进行。
