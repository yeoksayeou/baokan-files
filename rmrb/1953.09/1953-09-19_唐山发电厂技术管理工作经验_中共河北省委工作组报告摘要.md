Editor's Note: The Tangshan Power Plant has carried out a series of technical management tasks in the past few years, and has successively created safe power generation records of 290 days and 251 days. It has also achieved significant results in reducing coal and electricity consumption, and has therefore won the title of Model Plant for Safe and Economical Power Generation in North China. We now introduce the process of establishing technical management work in the plant and its main contents for learning and reference by various regions.

The Tangshan Power Plant was originally an old factory with backward technology and chaotic management. In the past few years, thanks to a series of reforms and strengthened technical management, it has achieved remarkable results in ensuring safe and economical power generation, and has won the title of Model Plant in North China. For example, taking the power generation in 1949 as 100, the power generation in 1952 increased to 168.9 percent. Coal consumption per kilowatt-hour decreased from 0.678 kg in 1949 to 0.558 kg in the first quarter of this year (series chain grate furnace), and the plant's own power consumption rate decreased from 7.4 percent in 1949 to 4.26 percent in 1952. Power generation accidents have been significantly reduced. There were 19 major accidents in 1949, only two in each of the years 1951 and 1952. There have been no major personal accidents in the past few years, and the plant has created safe operation records of 290 days and 251 days.

The Tangshan Power Plant mainly focused on the following aspects in its technical management work.

I. Establishing and Improving the Production Responsibility System

Before 1949, the Tangshan Power Plant had a very serious phenomenon of no one being responsible for production, and the technical responsibility system was also very poor, which could not guarantee safe power generation. In response to this situation, the plant's leadership, after repeated studies, decided to first launch a campaign to establish a responsibility system on the basis of democratic management.

The first step in establishing the responsibility system was to mobilize the masses to carry out the "finding owners for machines" campaign. Employees wrote out their responsibilities according to their job titles, handed them over to the group for discussion, the workshop for comprehensive review, and the leadership for approval, and finally determined them as a system. This initially stipulated the responsibilities of the squad leader and various types of work.

Secondly, implement the regional responsibility system, unified leadership, and clear division of labor. The factory director and chief engineer directly lead the electrical, steam turbine, and boiler workshops, assisted by the production technology section, safety engineer, and duty engineer. By strengthening the leadership of the workshops, the work of production, maintenance, and technical security has been coordinated. The engineers of the Production Technology Section are also assigned to be responsible for the technical guidance of the steam turbine, boiler, and electrical workshops, and uniformly guide the maintenance and repair work according to work needs, thus eliminating the chaotic phenomenon of no one being responsible.

Thirdly, in order to implement the responsibility system, the plant has successively proposed the slogans of safe power transmission for 45 days, 100 days, and 300 days, and signed collective contracts as the goals of struggle for all employees. Implementing no-accident rewards, many workers stared at the machines intently while working, greatly improving their sense of responsibility and achieving the goal of safe production.

With the development of production, the responsibility system has gradually been improved and upgraded. For example, they implemented the "special person-owner card" system, so that every part of every machine is the responsibility of a special person. They have formulated detailed rules for the connection between workshops, groups, and duty personnel, strengthened mutual supervision and assistance in collective mass production, and achieved collective safe production. They established a technical crash course to organize workers to learn about machine overviews, simple principles of power generation, and methods and reasons for handling accidents, and improved workers' confidence in mastering the machines. At the same time, certain welfare measures were improved, such as the establishment of a shift handover room, so that workers have rest time in the factory to prevent sleeping on duty; the canteen delivers food to night shift workers to avoid workers cooking their own meals and delaying work; and toilets were built in the production workshops to prevent accidents from occurring when workers go out. All the above measures have created favorable conditions for the implementation of the responsibility system.

II. Continuously Improve Operating Procedures

The power industry has the characteristics of a high degree of automation. All operations must meet standards in order to eliminate accidents and ensure safe production. However, operating procedures cannot be formulated perfectly and practically at once. They must be gradually revised and supplemented to become complete and standardized. The plant currently has four major operating procedures: operation, safety operation, accident handling, and maintenance. The implementation and implementation of these procedures has gone through an arduous struggle process. Because the leadership and employees have firmly implemented the principles of "striving to eliminate accidents and ensuring safe power transmission throughout the year" and "safety is the greatest economy," the operating procedures have been mastered by the masses and have become a habit consciously followed by the masses.

Their methods are as follows:

(1) Mobilize the masses to fight against accidents frequently. Seize every accident that occurs, analyze the root causes of the accident, and eliminate ideological obstacles to the implementation of operating procedures. Some workers in the plant believe that "even people have natural disasters and illnesses, let alone machines?" and have no confidence in eliminating accidents. The leadership, in response to these ideological situations, organized mass discussions on the causes of accidents, and used examples to illustrate that some accidents are man-made and can be avoided as long as they are paid attention to in the work, so that conservative ideas are criticized, and unified operation becomes the demand of the masses. Some workers also realize that accidents can be eliminated, but they despise operating procedures, believing that "we can work without operating procedures." The leadership used another example of a worker mistakenly closing the steam valve of Unit 2, which almost caused a major accident, to illustrate that accidents will occur if they do not follow the procedures, so that workers recognize that "relying only on old experience without following the procedures will inevitably lead to errors."

(2) Party, government, labor union, and youth league leading cadres must first earnestly study the rules and instructions of the higher authorities, personally participate in the formulation of operating procedures, familiarize themselves with the operating procedures, and go deep into the workshops to check the implementation of operating procedures at any time. First of all, check the situation of various major technical indicators. If advanced indicators are found, they will organize workers to discuss and improve operating methods; if they find that they do not meet the standards, they will find out the reasons and guide the workers to correct them; and they will always understand the ideological situation of employees in implementing the operating procedures, and help workers correct operating errors and shortcomings, so that workers can skillfully handle accidents.

(3) Rely on the wisdom of the masses to continuously improve operating procedures to make them concise and easy to implement. For example, establish an operating contact system to eliminate the phenomenon of accidents caused by insufficient contact. Implement machine labeling method, label important hub switches of machines such as water valves, steam valves, and oil valves with numbers and labels, indicating the opening and closing directions, and label water pipes, steam pipes, and oil pipes with different colors for easy identification. Implement operating order cards: according to the machine number, make various wooden cards, also numbered, and hang them together. After the operator receives the work order, he holds the wooden card and aligns it with the machine number to perform the operation to prevent errors. Implement operating tickets: write the operating procedures and steps on the ticket, and the operator performs according to the ticket to prevent errors due to unfamiliar operation. Make the procedures for handling emergency accidents into charts and hang them on the machines to help workers familiarize themselves with the procedures and steps for handling accidents.

(4) Holding good production inspection meetings, launching mass criticism and self-criticism, consolidating labor discipline, and implementing a safety bonus system are effective ways to ensure the thorough implementation of operating procedures.

III. Strengthen Technical Education and Continuously Improve the Technical Level of Employees

They adopted the following methods for technical education of employees: (1) Establish a technical crash training class, concentrating on using about two weeks of spare time to specialize in training certain technical businesses.

(2) Change the three-and-a-half shift work system to a four-shift work system, and some of the surplus workers are removed from production for rotational training. Rotate once a week. (3) Spare-time technical study, three hours a week, including one hour for a group technical research meeting, to implement "mutual learning, mutual questioning, mutual assistance, and mutual testing," so that what is learned can be skilled. They also implement an examination system, and those who pass are issued certificates, and those who fail continue to study. At present, the vast majority of new and old workers can pass 80 points or more.

They also implemented a master-apprentice contract system, stipulating that both parties guarantee to teach and learn certain businesses and technologies within one month. The teaching methods of masters and apprentices include oral instruction, operational practice, and daily exercises. If the study fails, another contract will be signed until the study passes before it can be regarded as a formal worker. Many young workers who have entered the factory for two or three years have quickly become skilled workers, and currently formal production workers with less than three years of service account for 50 percent.

IV. Improve Quality and Ensure Safe and Fast Maintenance

From leaders to employees, the plant regards machine maintenance work as an important production task. Their approach to maintenance work is:

(1) Prepare fully and formulate a complete maintenance plan: analyze past accidents before maintenance, check accidents caused by poor maintenance, refer to operating logs, and take examinations to study maintenance procedures and safety operation procedures. And through various meetings, the plan is mastered by the employees. These are important preparations for achieving rapid maintenance. (2) Strengthen the leadership of maintenance work, with the chief engineer as the head, and absorb relevant cadres from the Party, labor union, and youth league to form the general headquarters of the major maintenance, the workshop organizes the sub-headquarters, the work site forms the maintenance team, and each member has a clear task. (3) Implement the "Maintenance Task Book": according to the daily balance plan, based on the completion of the day's work, the workshop headquarters fills in the maintenance work items of each group on the second day in the maintenance task book, estimating the start and end time, work requirements, and precautions, ensuring that the work is carried out in an orderly manner according to the schedule and the maintenance plan is completed regularly. (4) Implement acceptance procedures to ensure quality. In addition to organizing an acceptance committee, each workshop also organized an acceptance team, which was checked by the maintenance负责人 and then submitted to the above two organizations for acceptance. A certificate of conformity was issued when the acceptance was qualified. If it did not meet the standards, it would be repaired again to ensure the quality of maintenance. (5) Implement a recording system. Record the degree of maintenance of various important components item by item, indicating the existing defects, degree of wear, and technical standards of the machine, so that there is a bottom in the center during operation and the next maintenance.

V. Plan and Purposefully Promote Advanced Experience

Since 1949, the plant has promoted eight advanced experiences from the Soviet Union, including rapid maintenance, burning low-value coal, reverse balance thermal efficiency, combined sewage discharge, overcurrent drying method, layered combustion, energy-saving and power-saving methods of Moscow No. 9 Power Plant, and Kovalev's work method. And pay attention to absorbing and promoting the advanced experience of brother factories and our factory, which has played a major role in promoting safe and economical power generation.

In the process of promoting advanced experience, they have encountered various obstacles of conservative thinking. For example, in order to reduce fuel costs, the factory sent cadres to the Shijingshan Power Plant to learn how to burn low-value coal. At the beginning of the implementation, many employees lacked confidence, and some said: "It was not possible to burn No. 2 coal in the past, let alone burning low-value coal?" But the leadership firmly and repeatedly explained to the workers, and finally the combustion was successful.

In promoting advanced experience, they can pay attention to the specific circumstances of the plant's production development and equipment conditions, and grasp the key issues. For example, in order to solve the problem that the boiler flame is too far back and affects the output, the plant focuses on promoting the advanced experience of layered combustion, concentrates on special research and experiments, and is currently close to success.

In promoting advanced experience, we must rely on the wisdom of the masses to solve difficult problems. When burning low-value coal, in order to overcome the difficulty of the steam pressure drop, the plant launched a rationalization proposal for workers, which was summarized by technicians, and finally created a successful "coal pulverizer" to maintain the steam pressure without dropping.

In order to consolidate and improve the banner role of typical groups and typical people, they generally hold an experience exchange meeting once a month to learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses. They not only make other groups learn from model groups, but also pay attention to making model groups learn and absorb the advantages of other groups. In order to prevent the pride and complacency of model groups and model figures, the Party committee often helps them summarize their experience and does not let go of criticism of their shortcomings. Therefore, their model groups and model figures always maintain a spirit of modesty, prudence, and self-criticism, and their model deeds can be quickly promoted.

VI. Technical Cadres Closely Combined with Workers to Drive Technical Management

When the Red May Competition Movement was launched in 1950, the connection between some technical cadres and the working masses in the plant was not close enough. Under the leadership of the Party and the auspices of the labor union, a workshop employee meeting was held to carry out criticism and self-criticism. After everyone's frank self-examination, they were ideologically harmonious and participated in the competition together, and proposed to strive to create a model workshop to complete the national task. This is the first step in the integration of technical personnel and workers.

Then, technical cadres widely spread technical theories to workers. Every engineer in the power plant is a teacher in the technical training class. This is the most welcome thing for workers. Some workers said, "After the engineer's explanation, my mind is much clearer." Technical cadres also feel that only by teaching technology to workers can they exert their work effectiveness and realize their ideals, so they are very active and patient. This further strengthened the relationship between the two parties.

Later, the plant's technical cadres often went deep into the field for experiments, and jointly studied and solved key problems in production with workers, and helped workers put forward rationalization proposals, which also enriched their technical theories, overcame cognitive limitations and one-sidedness, and exerted a greater effect of technical service for production. For example, in the campaign to save coal, workers realized from experience that coal consumption was low when it was drizzling, and proposed a rationalization proposal to add appropriate moisture to dry coal. After the research of technical cadres, it proved that this proposal could strengthen air circulation and promote good combustion, which aroused employees' attention to air volume and coal layer, and controlled them. At the same time, workers also proposed to correctly control the water level to reduce coal consumption, which also broke the technical cadres' theory of only paying attention to combustion. In the process of burning low-value coal, technical cadres directly invested in the investigation and summarized the good operating methods of workers, and drew the conclusion that how the air system, water system, and coal combustion should cooperate with each other, so that the burning of low-value coal was successful.

Now the plant's employees are vigorously studying the advanced experience of the Soviet Union's "Technical Management Regulations." They are striving with selfless labor to better realize the overall goal of long-term safe and economical power generation.

    唐山发电厂技术管理工作经验
    ——中共河北省委工作组报告摘要
    编者按：唐山发电厂几年来进行了一系列的技术管理工作，曾连续创造了二百九十天和二百五十一天的安全发电纪录，在减少煤、电的耗损方面，也获得了显著成绩，因而获得了华北安全经济发电模范厂的称号。我们现将该厂建立技术管理工作的过程及其主要内容介绍于后，供各地学习参考。
    唐山发电厂原是一个技术落后、管理紊乱的旧厂子。几年来，由于进行了一系列的改革工作，并加强了技术管理，在保证安全经济发电方面取得显著成绩，获得了华北模范厂的称号。如以一九四九年的发电量为一百，一九五二年的发电量增加到百分之一百六十八点九。每度电的煤耗，由一九四九年的零点六七八公斤，降到今年第一季度的零点五五八公斤（系练条炉），厂用电率由一九四九年的百分之七点四降低到一九五二年的百分之四点二六。发电事故更有显著减少，一九四九年曾发生重要事故十九次，一九五一和一九五二两年每年只有两次，几年来从未发生过重大的人身事故，全厂曾创造了二百九十天和二百五十一天的安全运行纪录。
    唐山发电厂在技术管理工作上，主要抓住了以下几个环节。
    一、建立与健全生产责任制
    唐山发电厂在一九四九年以前，生产上无人负责现象非常严重，技术上的负责制度也很差，不能保证安全发电。该厂领导上针对这种情况，经过反复研究，决定在民主管理的基础上，首先开展建立责任制运动。
    建立责任制的第一步，是发动群众开展“给机器找主人”运动。职工按着自己的职别，写出自己的责任范围，交给小组讨论，车间综合，领导批准，最后确定为制度。这就初步规定了班长及各工种的职责范围。
    其次，实行区域负责制，统一领导，明确分工。厂长、总工程师直接领导电气、汽机锅炉等车间，由生产技术股、保安工程师、值班工程师辅助他们。由于加强了车间领导，生产、维护和技术保安等项工作达到了协调。生产技术股的工程师又分工对汽机、锅炉、电气等车间负技术指导责任，并根据工作需要统一指导维护和修理工作，因而消灭了无人负责的混乱现象。
    第三，为了贯彻责任制度，该厂曾连续提出安全发送电四十五天、一百天、三百天的号召，并签订了集体合同，作为全体职工的奋斗目标。实行无事故奖励，许多工人在工作时目不转睛地看着机器，大大提高了工作的责任心，实现了安全生产的目的。
    随着生产的发展，责任制也逐步有了改进和提高。例如他们实行了“专人主人牌”制，使每一个机器的每一部分都有专人负责。制定了车间、小组和值班人之间的联系细则，加强了集体大生产中的互相监督协助，实现了集体安全生产。成立了技术速成班，组织职工学习机器概况、发电简单原理及事故处理的方法和理由，提高了工人掌握机器的信心。同时改进了某些福利措施，如成立交接班室，使工人在厂内有休息时间，防止上班睡觉；食堂给夜班工人送饭，以免工人自己做饭而耽误工作；在生产车间建立了厕所，以免工人外出时机器发生事故。以上所有各项办法，都给贯彻责任制度创造了有利条件。
    二、不断改进操作规程
    电业生产有着高度自动化的特点，必须使一切操作合乎标准，才能消除事故，保证安全生产。但是操作规程不是一下就能制订得完善和切合实际的，必须逐渐修订补充使之走向完整、正规。该厂现行的有运行操作、安全作业、事故处理及检修等四大操作规程，这些规程的实现和贯彻，曾经过艰苦的斗争过程，由于领导以至职工坚定不移地贯彻了“努力消灭事故、保证全年安全发送电”，“安全就是最大的经济”等方针，所以操作规程已为群众所掌握，成为群众自觉遵守的习惯了。
    他们的做法如下：
    （一）发动群众经常的向事故作斗争。抓住每一事故的发生，分析事故发生的根源，为贯彻操作规程扫除思想障碍。该厂有些工人认为“连人都有天灾病祸，何况机器呢？”对消除事故没有信心。领导上就针对这些思想情况，对发生事故的原因，组织群众性的讨论，并以实例说明有些事故是人为的，只要工作中时刻注意，就可避免事故，使保守思想受到批判，因而统一操作便成了群众的要求。还有些工人虽然认识到事故可以消灭，但轻视操作规程，认为“没有操作规程也一样工作”。领导上又以另一个工人误关二号机的蒸气门，险些造成重大事故的例子，说明不按规程办事就会发生事故，使工人认清“只凭老经验而不按规程办事，免不了要出错误”。
    （二）党、政、工、团领导干部，首先认真学习上级规章指示，亲自参加操作规程的制订，熟悉操作规程，并深入车间随时检查操作规程执行情况。首先是查看各项主要技术指标的情况。如发现先进指标，便组织工人讨论，改进操作方法；发现不合标准的，则查明原因指导工人纠正；并随时了解职工对执行操作规程的思想情况，帮助工人纠正操作上的错误和缺点，使工人在处理事故时能够熟练。
    （三）依靠群众的智慧，不断改进操作规程。使之简明易行。例如建立操作联系制度。消除了因联系不够而造成事故的现象。实行机器标明法，把机器的重要枢纽开关如水门、汽门、油门等加以编号标笺，注明开闭方向，把水管、汽管、油管等用各种不同的颜色加以标明，以便于识别。实行操作命令牌：根据机器编号，制成各种木牌，也编成号，挂在一起，操作人得到工作命令后，执木牌对准机器编号，进行操作，以防差错。实行操作票：把操作的程序步骤写在票上，操作人照票行事，防止因操作不熟练，而发生错误。将紧急事故处理的规程制成图表，挂在机器上，帮助工人熟悉处理事故的程序和步骤。
    （四）开好生产检查会议，展开群众性的批评与自我批评，巩固劳动纪律实行安全奖金制，是保证操作规程彻底贯彻的有效办法。
    三、加强技术教育，不断提高职工的技术水平
    他们对职工的技术教育，采取如下的方式进行：（一）成立技术速成训练班，集中使用两个星期左右的业余时间，专门训练一定的技术业务。
    （二）把三班半工作制改为四班工作制，多余的一些工人，脱离生产进行轮训。每周轮流一次。（三）业余技术学习，每周三小时，其中以一小时的时间，开小组的技术研究会，实行“互学、互问、互助、互测”，使所学到的东西，能够熟练。还实行考试制度，合格的发给证书，不合格的继续学习。目前绝大多数的新、老工人，都能考八十分以上。
    他们还实行了师徒合同制，规定在一个月中双方保证教会和学会某些业务、技术。师徒教学的方法有口授、操作实习、每日出演习题。学习不及格，再另订合同，直至学习及格，才能作为正式工。该厂有许多进厂二、三年的青工，都很快的成了熟练工人，目前三年工龄以下的正式生产工人，即占百分之五十。
    四、提高质量，保证安全快速检修
    该厂从领导到职工，都把机器检修工作当作一项重要的生产任务去进行。他们检修工作的做法是：
    （一）充分准备，制定完整的检修计划：检修前对过去曾发生的事故进行分析，检查因检修不良所引起的事故，参考运行日志，学习检修规程和安全作业规程进行考试。并通过各种会议，使计划为职工群众所掌握。这些都是实现快速检修的重要准备工作。（二）加强检修工作的领导，以总工程师为首，吸收党、工、团有关干部参加，组成大检修的总指挥部，车间组织分指挥部，工作地组成检修小组，每一成员任务明确。（三）实行了“检修任务书”：按日平衡计划，根据当日工作完成情况，由车间指挥部在检修任务书上填写各小组在第二天的检修工作项目，预计起止时间及工作要求和注意事项，保证了按进度表有条不紊地进行工作，定期完成检修计划。（四）贯彻验收规程，保证质量。除组织了验收委员会外，各车间又组织了验收小组，经检修负责人检查后，交上述两个组织验收，验收合格时发给合格证，如不合标准，再行修理，保证了检修质量。（五）实行记录制度。将各种重要机件的检修程度，逐项记下，表示出现在机器所存在着的缺陷、磨损程度、技术标准，以便于在运行时和下次检修中心中有底。
    五、有计划有目的地推广先进经验
    自从一九四九年以来，该厂推广了快速检修、燃烧低值煤、反平衡热效率、联系排污、过流干燥法、分层燃烧、莫斯科第九发电厂省煤节电的办法、郭瓦廖夫工作法等八种苏联先进经验。并注意吸取和推广各兄弟厂和本厂的先进经验，对安全经济发电，起了重大的推动作用。
    在推广先进经验的过程中，他们曾遇到各种保守思想的障碍，例如为了降低燃料成本，厂里派干部到石景山发电厂学习燃烧低值煤的方法，在开始推行时，许多职工信心不足，有的说：“过去只烧二号煤都不行，何况烧低值煤呢？”但领导上坚定不移，反复向工人解释，终于燃烧成功。
    在推广先进经验中，他们能注意根据该厂生产发展具体情况及设备条件，抓住关键问题。如该厂为了解决锅炉火焰靠后影响出力的问题，则抓住推行分层燃烧的先进经验，集中力量专题研究和试验，目前已接近成功。
    在推广先进经验中，必须依靠群众智慧，解决困难问题。该厂在燃烧低值煤时，为克服汽压下降的困难，发动工人提合理化建议，由技术员加以综合，终于创造“喷煤粉器”成功，保持了汽压不下降。
    他们为巩固与提高典型组、典型人的旗帜作用，一般的每个月开一次经验交流大会，互相取长补短。他们不仅使其他小组向模范小组学习，也注意使模范小组学习和吸取其他小组的优点。为防止模范小组、模范人物的骄傲自满情绪，党委经常帮助他们总结经验，并毫不放过对他们缺点的批评。因而他们的模范小组、模范人物始终保持着谦虚谨慎和自我批评的精神，他们的模范事迹能很快推广。
    六、技术干部与工人密切结合，动了技术管理工作
    一九五零年开展红五月竞赛运动时，该厂有的技术干部与工人群众的联系还不密切。在党的领导和工会主持下，召开了车间职工会议，开展批评与自我批评，经过大家开诚布公自我检讨，在思想上融洽一致，共同参加竞赛，并提出为完成国家任务争取创立模范车间。这是技术人员与工人结合的第一步。
    接着技术干部广泛地把技术理论传播给工人。电厂的每一个工程师，都是技术训练班的教师。这是工人最欢迎的事情。有的工人说“经工程师一讲，我的头脑亮堂多了”。技术干部也觉得只有把技术教给工人，才能发挥工作成效，才能实现自己的理想，因而非常积极耐心。这就进一步加强了双方的关系。
    以后，该厂技术干部经常深入现场试验，和工人共同研究解决生产上的关键问题，并帮助工人提出合理化建议，从而也就更丰富了自己的技术理论，克服了认识上的局限性与片面性，发挥了技术服务于生产的更大效果。如在开展节省煤的运动中，工人从经验中体会到下小雨时煤耗就低，提出对干煤加适当水分的合理化建议，经技术干部的研究结果，证明这一建议可加强空气的流通，促使燃烧良好，从而引起职工对风量、煤层的重视，而加以控制。同时工人还提出要正确地控制水位，以降低煤耗，也打破了技术干部只注意燃烧的理论。在燃烧低值煤的过程中，技术干部直接投入了查定工作，总结了工人中好的操作方法，得出风系统、水系统及煤的燃烧三者如何相互配合的结论，从而使燃烧低值煤得到成功。
    现在该厂职工正在大力学习苏联“技术管理法规”的先进经验。他们以忘我的劳动，为更好地实现长期安全经济大发电的总目标而奋斗着。
