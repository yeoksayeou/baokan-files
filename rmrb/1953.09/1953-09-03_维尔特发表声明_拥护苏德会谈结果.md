Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 27th (TASS dispatch) - According to the German News Agency in Dusseldorf, Dr. Joseph Wirth, Chairman of the German League for Unity, Peace and Freedom, and former Chancellor of the Weimar Republic, issued a statement to the press regarding the talks between the Soviet Union and the government of the German Democratic Republic. The statement said: The results of the talks confirm that only through peaceful means to reach agreements, that is, only through consultation, can peace and the permanent prosperity of the German people be guaranteed. The Soviet attitude is in accordance with the wishes of the German people. The promises obtained in Moscow by the delegation of the German Democratic Republic guarantee the political and economic independence of the German people. The measures taken by the Soviet Union to alleviate the financial and economic obligations borne by the German Democratic Republic as a result of the war are an act of generosity that no victorious power has ever shown to a defeated country. The statement concludes: "On September 6, the people of West Germany will have the opportunity to reject Adenauer's war policy, cast their votes for those who demand pan-German talks, and thereby create the preconditions for the unification of Germany in peace and freedom."
