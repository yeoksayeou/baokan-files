Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 27th: Zhaocunxin, Chairman of the People's Government of the Dai Autonomous Region of Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Province, wrote to Chairman Mao on the eve of National Day. The letter states:

Respected Chairman Mao: The fourth anniversary of the birth of the great People's Republic of China is approaching. On behalf of the 200,000 people of 45 ethnic groups in the Dai Autonomous Region of Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Province, I would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to you and pay our highest respects. In the nearly four years since the liberation of Xishuangbanna, thanks to the wise leadership of the Communist Party and you, and the vigorous assistance of the Han people, especially since the official establishment of the autonomous region on January 23 this year, remarkable achievements have been made in all aspects, and people of all ethnic groups have realized their right to be masters of their own affairs. In the autonomous organs, we use our own national language and Chinese in coordination as the main tools for exercising our functions and powers. Ethnic groups respect each other, and jointly study and fully consult on the basis of unity and equality, so that every problem can be solved satisfactorily. This is unprecedented in the history of Xishuangbanna, proving that regional autonomy fully meets the practical requirements of all ethnic groups.

The establishment of the autonomous region has powerfully promoted production, trade, health, and education. In terms of production, thanks to the specific leadership of people's governments at all levels and the provision of large quantities of food, seeds, and farm tools, the practical difficulties in production have been overcome, and farmers have continuously improved their farming techniques, with production enthusiasm increasing year by year. It is estimated that the region can increase grain production by 3 million catties this year. State-owned trading organizations have vigorously supplied salt and daily necessities in the autonomous region, and the people's economic life is improving day by day. Thanks to the large number of medical personnel you sent, people of all ethnic groups have the opportunity to receive free medical treatment. According to incomplete statistics for the first half of this year alone, more than 40,000 patients have received free medical treatment, and the population mortality rate has gradually decreased. The masses of all ethnic groups cheered: Chairman Mao loves us even more than our parents. The higher-level people's government attaches great importance to cultural and educational work, and has allocated funds to open schools and send teachers. At present, our region has one junior normal school and 37 primary schools. Foreign cadres directly under the People's Government of the Autonomous Region are working hard to learn the Dai language. Recently, the Consultative Committee of the People's Representatives Conference of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region passed a resolution to improve the Dai language and established a Dai Language Improvement Committee. In order to further implement your great ethnic policy, we established four Banna regimes in June and July, and assisted the people in the mountainous areas to establish two directly subordinate autonomous regions for the Aini and Yao ethnic groups. This has more broadly united patriotic democratic people of all ethnic groups and leading figures who have connections with the masses. Other Banna governments are also actively preparing for establishment. We also plan to cultivate activists, patriotic intellectuals, and leading figures who have connections with the masses, some of whom have already assumed leadership positions. The number of ethnic minority cadres in people's governments at all levels is increasing, accounting for 63.1 percent of the total number of cadres, including 62 cadres at or above the district level.

Although there are many ethnic groups in our region, under the illumination of your great ethnic policy, a new atmosphere of unity and mutual assistance between ethnic groups has begun to emerge. For example, the Aini and other ethnic groups in the mountainous areas have little food and face difficult living conditions, the Dai people automatically proposed: increase the Dai people's public grain so that the Aini people can receive more care, and some Dai people helped Aini people who had no houses to build houses. The Aini people in the mountainous areas also voluntarily wanted to help the Dai farmers in the dams transport grain. The Dai people of Banna Mengzhe and Mengwang welcomed brothers of all ethnic groups in the mountainous areas to go down to the dams to reclaim land for farming. Now, more than 200 households of seven ethnic groups including the Aini have moved to the dams to farm. All these make us fully feel that we have moved from the era of national oppression to a new era of national equality! At the same time, we deeply realize that Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang is "Pee?" (Dai language, meaning fierce man-eating demon), and the Communist Party is "Pujivi" (Dai language, meaning savior). Only by following you forever can we, the people of all ethnic groups, obtain the "Sangbadipoya" that we have longed for day and night (Dai language, meaning a life of endless happiness and abundance). We guarantee that we will continue to increase production in the future, strengthen the joint defense and self-defense forces of the people in our region, support the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and strive to smash the imperialist conspiracy activities, protect the happiness of the people of all ethnic groups, and consolidate national defense!

    云南西双版纳傣族自治区人民政府主席
    国庆前夕写信给毛主席报告自治区的成就
    【新华社昆明二十七日电】云南省西双版纳傣族自治区人民政府主席召存信，在国庆前夕上书毛主席。信上说：
    敬爱的毛主席：伟大的中华人民共和国诞生四周年纪念快到了，我谨代表云南省西双版纳傣族自治区四十五种民族二十多万人民，向您表示衷心的感激，并致崇高的敬礼。西双版纳解放近四年来，由于共产党和您的英明领导以及汉族人民的大力帮助，特别是今年一月二十三日正式建立自治区以后，不论在那方面都有了显著的成就，各族人民实现了当家作主的权利。在自治机关中，我们采用本民族文字和汉文配合为行使职权的主要工具，民族间互相尊重，在团结平等的基础上共同研究充分协商，因此使每个问题都能得到圆满解决。这是西双版纳历史上空前未有的事情，证明区域自治完全符合于各民族的切身要求。
    自治区的建立，有力地推动了生产、贸易、卫生、教育工作。在生产方面，由于各级人民政府的具体领导并贷放大批口粮、籽种、农具，帮助各族人民克服了生产中的实际困难，农民不断改进了耕作技术，生产情绪一年比一年高，估计今年全区可以增产粮食三百万斤。国营贸易机构在自治区曾大力供应盐巴和日用必需品，人民的经济生活正在一天天上升。由于您派来了大批医务人员，各族人民有了免费治病的机会，仅据今年上半年不完全统计，受到免费诊疗的病人有四万多，人口死亡率已逐渐减少，各族人民群众欢呼：毛主席比爹妈还疼我们。上级人民政府很重视文化教育工作，先后拨经费开办学校，派来教员，现我区已有初级师范一所，小学三十七所。自治区人民政府直属各机关的外来干部都在努力学习傣文傣语，最近自治区各族人民代表会议协商委员会又通过改进傣文的决议，成立了傣文改进委员会。为了进一步贯彻您的伟大民族政策，我们在六、七月间建立了四个版纳政权，并协助山区人民建立了爱尼族、瑶族两个直属自治区。这样就更广泛地团结了各族爱国民主人士及与群众有联系的领袖人物，其它的版纳政府也正在积极筹备建立。我们还有计划地培养群众中的积极分子、爱国知识分子及与群众有联系的领袖人物，其中有些人已担任领导职务。各级人民政府中的民族干部越来越多，占全体干部人数的百分之六十三点一，其中区级以上的干部有六十二人。
    我区虽然民族众多，但在您的伟大民族政策照耀下，开始呈现了民族间团结互助的新气象。如山区爱尼族及其他民族粮食少，生活困难，傣族人民自动提出：增加傣族的公粮使爱尼族得到更多的照顾，有的傣族群众帮助没有房子住的爱尼族人盖房子，山区的爱尼族也自动地要帮助坝子上的傣族农民运粮。版纳勐遮、勐旺的傣族人民，并欢迎山区各民族兄弟下坝开荒种地，现在那边已有爱尼族等七种民族的二百多户搬到坝子上种田。所有这些都使我们充分感觉到：我们已从民族压迫时代走到民族平等的新时代了！同时，使我们深刻认识到蒋介石国民党“敝?”
  （傣话凶恶的吃人魔鬼）、共产党“普吉维”（傣话救星），我们各族人民只有永远跟着您走，才能得到日夜向往的“桑巴底坡瑶”（傣话，意即吃不尽穿不完无限幸福美好的生活）。我们保证今后要继续提高生产，并加强我区人民联防自卫力量、拥护中国人民解放军，为粉碎帝国主义阴谋活动、保卫各族人民的幸福和巩固国防而奋斗！
