    During the Rainy Season
    Attention Should Be Paid to Preventing Accidents of Temporary Buildings Collapsing
    Jia Liansheng and Hao Binggang from the Labor and Wage Department of the North China Administrative Council Construction Engineering Bureau write: Recently, there have been continuous rains in various parts of North China. Many temporary buildings on construction sites, such as workers' dormitories, work sheds, and material warehouses, have tilted, cracked, and even collapsed due to unstable foundations and softened soil after rain. For example, the walls of the workers' dormitory at construction site 52027 of the First Engineering District of the North China Direct Construction Engineering Company are showing concave-convex phenomena due to being soaked by rain for several days; the tile and grey-tiled roofs are also leaking. A woodworking shed has tilted westward. The kitchen chimney has collapsed in the rain. Another example is the grey-tiled work shed at construction site 53029 of the Fourth Engineering District of the same company, which collapsed due to exceeding its load-bearing capacity and continuous rain. There are two similar work sheds on-site that are about to collapse and have had to be dismantled. Many construction sites are located in low-lying suburban areas. During this rainy season, special attention must be paid to this issue. The management departments of construction sites should strengthen inspections and take necessary measures to vigorously prevent the collapse of temporary buildings and casualties.

    在多雨季节
    应注意防止工棚倒塌事故
    华北行政委员会建筑工程局劳动工薪处郏连生、郝炳刚来信：华北各地近日阴雨连绵，建筑工地上不少工人宿舍、工作棚和料库等临时性建筑物因为地基夯得不坚实和雨后土质松软而歪斜、裂缝甚至倒塌。如华北直属第一建筑工程公司一工区五二零二七工地工人宿舍的墙身，因连日被雨水浸湿，已呈凹凸现象；瓦顶和青灰顶也已漏雨。一幢木工工作棚已向西歪斜。工地伙房烟筒已在雨中倒塌。又如该公司四工区五三零二九工地的青灰顶工作棚，由于超过负荷量和连日下雨，已经倒塌了一幢。现场还有类似的二座工作棚将要倒塌，只好拆除。各地不少建筑工地都是处在地势低洼的郊区，在这多雨季节，必须特别注意这个问题。工地管理部门应该加强检查并采取必要措施，大力防止临时建筑物倒塌和伤亡事故。
