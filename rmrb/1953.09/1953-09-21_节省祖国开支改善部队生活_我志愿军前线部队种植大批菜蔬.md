Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 20th: To save the country's expenses and improve the troops' living standards, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army units have cultivated large quantities of vegetables in the arduous and tense combat environment. These vegetables not only improved the troops' lives but also saved the motherland's expenditure.

This spring, while the Korean War was still in progress, commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army used the gaps between combat and work to open up vegetable gardens on the hillsides and beside the river ditches near the positions, planting various vegetables. A certain company of the Volunteer Army on the western front planted fifteen mu of vegetables and harvested more than 20,400 jin from spring to mid-September, exceeding the planned production by nearly three times. They also carefully stored the remaining vegetables in preparation for winter consumption. On the "Dingzishan" front, the soldiers used the gaps between the shell craters bombarded by enemy artillery fire to plant various vegetables. So far, one company has harvested more than 10,000 jin, and another company has harvested more than 50,000 jin. According to incomplete statistics, the Volunteer Army units on the central front produced more than 380,000 jin of various vegetables in the three months from April to July. Generally, they can be eaten until November this year, and some can be eaten until January next year.

When planting vegetables began this autumn, the senior political organs of the troops made specific arrangements. The area for planting vegetables this autumn in the central front units is more than 210 mu. Staff members of all levels of organizations also actively participated in planting vegetables. Now, various green vegetable seedlings are growing everywhere near the fortifications, barracks, and offices on the front line. It is estimated that the production results in autumn will greatly exceed those in spring.

    节省祖国开支改善部队生活
    我志愿军前线部队种植大批菜蔬
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十日电】中国人民志愿军各部队在艰苦紧张的战斗环境中，种植了大批菜蔬。这些菜蔬不仅改善了部队生活并且节省了祖国的开支。
    今年春天，当朝鲜战争正在进行的时候，中国人民志愿军的指挥员、战斗员们就利用战斗和工作的空隙，在阵地附近的山坡上、河沟旁开辟菜圃，种植了各种菜蔬。西线志愿军某连种菜十五亩，自春季到九月中旬已经收获二万零四百多斤，超过预定生产计划近三倍。他们还将剩余的菜蔬小心地收藏起来，准备冬季食用。在“丁字山”前线，战士们利用被敌人炮火轰击过的炮弹坑之间的空隙土地，在上面种植了各种菜蔬，到目前为止，某连已收一万多斤，另一个连队的收获达五万多斤。据不完全统计，中部前线志愿军各部队在四月到七月的三个月中已生产各种菜蔬三十八万多斤。一般都可以吃到今年十一月，有的可以吃到明年一月。
    今年秋季开始种菜时，部队的高级政治机关都作了具体的布置。中线各部队今秋种菜面积在二百一十亩以上。各级机关的工作人员也都积极参加种菜。现在在前线的工事、营房以及机关办公室附近，到处都长着绿油油的各种菜苗，估计秋季的生产成绩将大大超过春季。
