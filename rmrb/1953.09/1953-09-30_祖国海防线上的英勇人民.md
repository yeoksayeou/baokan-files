    The coastal areas of Fujian Province, on the front lines of the motherland's coast defense, present a thriving scene everywhere. The fields are filled with lush crops, white mountains of salt pile up on the salt farms, and at every ebb and flow of the tide, fleets of fishing boats shuttle back and forth on the vast ocean.
    Here, only a strip of water separates us from the enemy-held islands, and the remnants of the Chiang bandits, supported by U.S. imperialism, constantly harass the coastal areas. But the powerful People's Liberation Army and the courageous people continuously strike them, maintaining tranquility and prosperity in the motherland's coast defense front.
    In mid-July this year, when remnants of the Chiang bandit army invaded Dongshan Island in Fujian, the people on the coast defense line demonstrated their high patriotism in defending their homes and the motherland.
    As soon as the fighting started, the people of Dongshan Island and nearby areas immediately took action. The Dongshan Island militia cooperated with the People's Liberation Army to guard key transportation routes, stand guard, and directly participate in the battle. When Chiang bandit paratroopers landed near the Bachimen ferry in Houlin Township, northern Dongshan Island, the Houlin Township militia immediately organized to resist the enemy, blocking some of the Chiang bandit paratroopers in Houlin Village. Militias and farmers from nearby townships also immediately rose up to encircle and annihilate the enemy together with the People's Liberation Army. Militia member Lin Dusheng and farmer Lin Dafu seized a machine gun from a Chiang bandit paratrooper and used it to strafe the enemy. They persisted until the People's Liberation Army arrived and cooperated with the People's Liberation Army to quickly annihilate this group of Chiang bandit paratroopers.
    Young and middle-aged people on the island organized transportation teams and stretcher teams to help the People's Liberation Army transport ammunition and wounded soldiers. The elderly and women boiled water and cooked food day and night, delivering it to the PLA soldiers despite the artillery fire. The people of Dianzhai Village in the northwest corner of Dongshan Island, in order to provide water and food for the PLA soldiers pursuing the enemy, lined up on both sides of the road to deliver water and food to the soldiers.
    Chen Daizi, a young woman from Tanshi Township, is a shining example of the heroic people on the coast defense line. After the battle broke out on Dongshan Island, Chen Daizi and many women went to the People's Liberation Army positions to deliver water, encountering Chiang bandit soldiers on the way. They immediately turned back, but the bandits caught up with Chen Daizi and demanded water from her. Chen Daizi resolutely refused and cursed the Chiang bandits: "The boiled water I made is for the People's Liberation Army, not for you short-lived dogs!" The Chiang bandits tried to snatch the water, but she kicked over the bucket, spilling the boiling water all over the ground, so that the Chiang bandits could not get a single drop. Chen Daizi, the heroic daughter of the motherland, also heroically sacrificed her life under the frantic shooting of the Chiang bandits.
    The people of Dongshan Island launched struggles against the Chiang bandit army everywhere. When the Chiang bandit army fled under the severe blows of our army, they raided some villages. The local people immediately hid their grain and smashed their pots, not giving the enemy anything. When the enemy forced them to carry ammunition, they cleverly threw the ammunition into the river during the enemy's confusion. Farmer Wang Xingshui also cleverly carried four boxes of enemy ammunition back and gave them to the People's Liberation Army. Many people also used carrying poles, kitchen knives, and hoes to kill or capture the enemy. On the day the battle broke out, Yunxiao County, adjacent to Dongshan Island, dispatched more than 6,000 people to support the front lines. Boatmen from Zhao'an, Yunxiao, and Zhangpu, and auto workers from Quanzhou and Zhangzhou, continuously sent large quantities of supplies to the front lines. Teachers and male and female students from many schools also voluntarily requested to participate in rear service work. The heroic people on the coast defense line and the powerful People's Liberation Army formed a fighting whole, firmly defending the sacred and inviolable national defense of the motherland, leaving the enemy battered and bruised.
    The militia composed of farmers, fishermen, and salt workers in the coastal areas of Fujian has become a strong assistant to the People's Liberation Army. They are active day and night on the coast, in the countryside, and in every corner, bravely and ingeniously fighting against open or hidden enemies. One morning, Chen Jinding, a first-class militia model in Haicheng County, and militia member Lan Qingshui were patrolling the coast when they saw a boat sailing crookedly towards the shore. Based on the boat's navigation, Chen Jinding determined that it was not a merchant ship. He asked Lan Qingshui to report to the troops, and he ran home to get a gun. When he came back with the gun, the boat had already docked. He bravely rushed up, raised his gun, and aimed at the people landing on the shore, saying, "Don't move, raise your hands!" He also shouted to the people still on the boat, "Everyone stand up!" The eleven people on and off the boat had no time to resist and were all driven ashore by Chen Jinding. Then the People's Liberation Army and the militia arrived and found a machine gun, a submachine gun, and more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition on the boat. It turned out that these eleven people were all Chiang bandit soldiers and secret agents who dreamed of sneaking in here to harass.
    The militia in the coastal areas of Fujian has not only created great achievements in the struggle to defend the coast, but also played a major role in production. After the completion of the land reform, Huang Haicheng, a first-class militia model in Haicheng County, took the lead in organizing mutual aid teams among the militia in his township. The mutual aid team he led was selected as a first-class model production increase unit in Fujian Province in 1952. This spring, the Huang Haicheng mutual aid team developed into an agricultural production cooperative. After further improving production technology, preventing and controlling natural disasters, and managing operations rationally, this year's early rice yield increased by 20% compared to last year. The militia on Sandu Island in Ningde County organized a hunting team that searched the mountains day and night to hunt wild animals that harmed crops. In more than a year, they hunted a total of 246 wild boars, muntjacs, etc., basically eliminating the animal pests on the entire island, freeing up labor to engage in production and reclaiming land that had been abandoned due to animal pests in the past. Last year, the island produced 248,000 jin more grain than the previous year. This hunting team was honorably selected as the model hunting team in Ningde County.
    The heroic people on the coast defense line are both working hard to build their hometowns and vigilantly defending their motherland. (Xinhua News Agency)

    祖国海防线上的英勇人民
    陈启桐、赖再、余慧、维民、树溪
    祖国海防前线的福建省沿海地区，到处呈现着一片欣欣向荣的景象。田野中长着茂盛的庄稼，盐场上堆积着一座座洁白的盐山，每当早晚潮汛时刻，成群结队的渔船在波涛万顷的海洋上来往穿梭。
    这里和敌人盘据的岛屿仅一水之隔，残余蒋匪在美帝国主义支持下不断向沿海地区窜扰。但是强大的人民解放军和勇敢的人民不断给他们以打击。使祖国的海防前线地区始终保持宁静和繁荣。
    今年七月中旬，残余蒋匪军窜犯福建东山岛时，海防线上的人民，表现了他们保卫家乡和保卫祖国的高度爱国主义精神。
    战斗一打响，东山岛和附近各地的人民立即行动起来。东山岛民兵配合解放军把守交通要道、警戒放哨，并直接参加战斗。蒋匪伞兵降落到东山岛北部后林乡八尺门渡口附近时，后林乡的民兵立即组织起来抗击敌人，把部分蒋匪伞兵阻击在后林村。附近各乡的民兵和农民也马上起来和解放军一起围剿敌人。民兵林笃生和农民林大富从一个蒋匪伞兵手中缴来一挺机枪扫射敌人。他们坚持到解放军到达，并配合解放军将这股蒋匪伞兵迅速歼灭。
    岛上青壮年都组织了运输队、担架队，帮助解放军运送弹药和伤员。老年人和妇女日夜烧水烧饭，并冒着炮火送到解放军战士手里。东山岛西北角的店宅村人民，为了使追歼敌人的解放军喝上水，吃上饭，他们就排在公路两旁，把水和饭送到战士手里。
    探石乡姑娘陈黛子是海防线上的英勇人民的光辉榜样。在东山岛发生战斗后，陈黛子和许多妇女一起到解放军阵地送水，在路上遇到了蒋匪军。她们立即扭头往回走，但匪徒们追上了陈黛子，向她要水喝。陈黛子坚决拒绝，并大骂蒋匪：“我烧的开水是给解放军喝的，不是给你们这些狗短命喝的！”蒋匪动手来抢水，她一脚把水桶踢翻，开水流满一地，使蒋匪一口水也喝不到。祖国的英雄女儿陈黛子也在蒋匪的疯狂射击下英勇牺牲了。
      东山岛的人民到处和蒋匪军展开了斗争。当蒋匪军在我军严重打击下逃跑时，窜扰了一些村庄，当地人民立即将粮食藏好，把锅砸破，不给敌人任何东西。敌人强迫他们挑弹药，他们就趁敌人混乱时将弹药丢进河里。农民王兴水，还巧妙地将敌人的四箱子弹挑回来送给了解放军。许多人民还用扁担、菜刀、锄头杀伤或俘掳了敌人。邻近东山岛的云霄县，在战斗发生的当天，就出动了六千多人支援前线。诏安、云霄、漳浦的船工和泉州、漳州的汽车工人，源源不绝地将大量物资送上前线。许多学校的教师和男女学生，也自动要求参加后方勤务工作。英勇的海防线上的人民和强大的人民解放军结成了一个战斗的整体，坚强地保卫了神圣不可侵犯的祖国国防，使敌人碰得头破血流。
    福建沿海各地的农民、渔民和盐民组成的民兵已成为人民解放军的得力助手。他们日夜活跃在海边、农村和每个角落，勇敢而又机智地和公开的或隐蔽的敌人斗争。一天早晨，海澄县一等民兵模范陈进丁和民兵蓝清水到海边巡查，看见一只船歪歪斜斜地向海岸驶来，陈进丁根据船只航行的情况，断定它不是商船。他叫蓝清水去报告部队，自己跑回家去拿枪。当他拿枪回来时，船已靠岸。他勇敢地追上去，端起枪对准上岸的人说：“不准动，举起手来！”又对还在船上的人喊道：“都站出来！”船上船下十一个人来不及抵抗，都被陈进丁赶到岸上去了。接着人民解放军和民兵赶来，在这只船里搜出了一挺机枪、一支冲锋枪和一千多发子弹。原来这十一个人都是蒋匪军和特务，他们梦想在这里偷渡骚扰。
    福建沿海的民兵，不但在保卫海防的斗争中，创造了很大的功迹，而且在生产中也发挥了重大的作用。海澄县一等民兵模范黄海澄在土地改革完成后，首先带领该乡民兵组织互助组。他领导的互助组在一九五二年被选为福建省的一等模范增产单位。今年春季，黄海澄互助组发展为农业生产合作社，在进一步改进生产技术、防治自然灾害和合理经营以后，今年早稻又比去年增产两成。在宁德县三都岛上的民兵，组织的打猎队，日夜翻山越岭追捕为害庄稼的野兽。一年多，他们共猎获山猪、山麂等二百四十六只，基本上消灭了全岛的兽害，腾出了劳动力进行生产，开垦过去因兽害而荒废了的田地，去年全岛比前年多出产二十四万八千斤粮食。这个打猎队光荣地被选为宁德县模范打猎队。
    海防线上的英勇人民正在一面努力建设自己的家乡，一面警惕地保卫着自己的祖国。（新华社）
