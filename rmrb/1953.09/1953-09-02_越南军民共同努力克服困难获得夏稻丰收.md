Xinhua News Agency, 31st: According to the Vietnam News Agency, farmers across Vietnam, under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party and local people's governments, have overcome many difficulties caused by enemy sabotage and natural disasters and achieved a bumper summer rice harvest this year.

The total harvest volume in the summer rice regions remains at the 1952 level. The yield per hectare has greatly increased in many places. The fourth and fifth inter-zones of Central Vietnam are the most prominent. In many areas of Quang Tri province, rice production has increased by more than 50%, and in Thanh Hoa province in northern Central Vietnam, the provincial output has increased by 15%.

Since the beginning of summer, the French colonial army has continuously dispatched troops to conduct "mopping-up operations." Especially in the enemy-controlled areas, the French aggressors wantonly burned rice paddies, slaughtered livestock, and destroyed irrigation projects. During the harvest season, they looted rice, shot at farmers, and prevented harvesting. Farmers in various places actively cooperated with the People's Army to successfully smash the French colonialists' "mopping-up operations" and other attempts to destroy crops, expanding the liberated and guerrilla areas behind enemy lines. Farmers in many areas have also reclaimed large tracts of wasteland. In a guerrilla base near Haiphong in North Vietnam, more than 1,800 hectares of land that had been abandoned due to enemy terror have now been reclaimed. During the harvest, farmers and soldiers coordinated their actions, organizing the harvesting, storage, and transportation of rice to prevent it from being destroyed or falling into enemy hands.

Farmers have also achieved many victories in repairing dikes, sluice gates, and other water conservancy projects. For example, in Thai Binh province in North Vietnam, farmers waged a determined struggle, forcing the enemy to allow them to repair an important sluice gate, ensuring the planting of 29,600 hectares of summer rice in the surrounding area.

Farmers have also achieved good results in the fight against drought. Farmers in the provinces on the left bank of the Red River have dredged a total of more than 300 kilometers of irrigation canals. In central Vietnam, Quang Ngai province alone dug 400 ponds. Farmers in Phu Tho province in North Vietnam have saved more than 700 hectares of summer rice from drought by digging wells and ponds.

The fight against pests has been as effective as other struggles. Farmers in Nghe An province in northern Central Vietnam, with the help of students and other children, captured 5.3 tons of pests, saving many rice paddies from insect damage.

While carrying out these tasks, Vietnamese farmers have also worked hard to improve their farming techniques.

    越南军民共同努力克服困难获得夏稻丰收
    【新华社三十一日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南全国各地的农民在越南劳动党和地方人民政府的领导下，克服了由于敌人破坏和天灾造成的许多困难，获得了今年夏季稻米的丰收。
    夏季稻米地区的总收获量保持着一九五二年的数字。许多地方每公顷的产量大大增加了。中越
    （即越南中部）第四和第五联区最为突出。广治省许多地区的大米产量增加了百分之五十以上，中越北部清化省全省的产量增加了百分之十五。
    入夏以来，法国殖民军曾不断派遣军队进行“扫荡”。特别在敌后地区，法国侵略者放肆烧毁稻田，杀害耕畜和破坏灌溉工程。在收割时节，他们作掠夺稻米的活动，并开枪射击农民，阻止收割。各地农民积极和人民军合作，胜利地粉碎了法国殖民者的“扫荡”和其他破坏庄稼物的企图，扩大了敌后解放区和游击区。很多地区的农民还开垦了大量荒地。在北越海防附近的一个游击根据地中，有一千八百公顷以上由于敌人的恐怖行动而曾经被丢荒的土地，现在已经开垦了。在收割的时候，农民和军队配合行动，有组织地收割、收藏和搬运稻米，使它们不致遭到敌人的破坏或落在敌人的手里。
    农民们在修复堤坝、水闸和其他水利工程方面，也取得很多胜利。例如，在北越的太平省，农民进行了坚决的斗争，迫使敌人让他们修好一处重要的水闸，保证种上了周围二万九千六百公顷的夏稻。
    在抗旱斗争中，农民们也获得了很好的成果。红河左岸各省的农民已经疏通了共有三百多公里长的灌溉渠。在中越南部，仅广义一省就掘了四百个池塘。北越富寿省的农民，由于掘了水井和池塘，已抢救了七百多公顷的夏季稻田免受旱灾。
    对害虫进行的斗争也和其他的斗争一样收到了效果。中越北部义安省的农民在学生和其他儿童的帮助下，捕捉了五点三吨害虫，使许多稻田免于虫害。
    在进行这些工作的同时，越南农民还努力改进了他们的耕作技术。
