Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 19th (TASS): The United Nations General Assembly held a plenary session on the morning of September 17th to begin general debate.

U.S. Secretary of State Dulles delivered a speech at the meeting. He said: "The United States attends the Eighth Session of the United Nations General Assembly with the determination to utilize the opportunities provided by the United Nations to promote the cause of peace and justice." He added that the U.S. delegation would "respect different opinions." He stated: "The United States will strive to avoid any words and actions that would only worsen the current dangerous tensions."

However, Dulles' entire speech did not match these words at all.

Dulles spoke of the United States being prepared to "explore ways to end the current tensions," but when he touched upon the Korean question, he defended the U.S. aggression in Korea as he had done before. Dulles "demanded" that the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China abandon certain "ambitions" in Korea as a prerequisite for the Koreans to solve the Korean question themselves. At the same time, he said that the United States would never find "any excuse to use Korea as a military outpost on the Asian continent." However, he did not say a word about the treaty signed between the United States and Syngman Rhee, the content of which directly refuted his statement above.

Dulles tried his best to defend the existence of the aggressive North Atlantic Alliance and other militarist groups. He insisted that these groups were "defensive" in nature. Dulles also defended the establishment of the so-called "European Defense Community," emphasizing that this group "will incorporate German military forces."

Dulles said that the Soviet Union "should make more contributions than ever before" in creating "a new international atmosphere." In his speech, he demanded that the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies abandon their principled positions on a series of the most important international issues such as Korea, Germany, and Austria. As for the policies of the United States, Dulles only said in general terms: "The United States and other countries should also make their contributions and fulfill their obligations." However, what exactly these "contributions" are, Dulles didn't say a word.

In his speech, Dulles attempted to shift the responsibility for the long delay in solving the German question and concluding the Austrian peace treaty to the Soviet Union.

Regarding the issue of arms limitation, Dulles made it clear that the United States is currently unwilling to reduce armaments and armed forces. Dulles suggested that the current work should be limited to "studying the issues of limiting and controlling all kinds of armaments" and other "technical" and "preparatory work."

In the final part of his speech, Dulles spoke of the need to re-examine the United Nations Charter. He pointed out that as early as 1948, the United States Senate had passed a resolution calling for the abolition of the veto power in the Security Council's discussion of "the peaceful settlement of international disputes and the admission of new member states." He also pointed out that the U.S. Senate passed a resolution this year appointing a "special committee" to "study proposals to amend the Charter." He tried to make it sound as if the United States' request to amend the UN Charter was to strengthen the United Nations. However, Dulles could not deny the obvious fact that in order to strengthen the United Nations and enable it to successfully solve all major tasks, it is precisely necessary to strictly abide by the Charter, and not to undermine the Charter by preparing to re-examine it.

Dulles' speech attacked the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the People's Democracies of Europe in many places.

### 杜勒斯在联大演说为美国侵略政策辩护  妄图推卸美国制造国际紧张局势的责任

    杜勒斯在联大演说为美国侵略政策辩护
    妄图推卸美国制造国际紧张局势的责任
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社纽约十九日讯：联合国大会于九月十七日上午举行全体会议，开始一般辩论。
    美国国务卿杜勒斯在会上发表演说。他说：“美国出席联合国第八届大会，抱着要利用联合国组织所给予的机会来促进和平与正义的事业的决心。”他又说，美国代表团将“尊重各种不同的意见”。他表示：“美国将竭力避免徒然会使目前这种危险的紧张局势更加恶化的任何言语和行动。”
    然而，杜勒斯的整篇演说丝毫也不符合他所讲的这些话。
    杜勒斯谈到美国准备“探求结束目前紧张局势的道路”，然而当接触到朝鲜问题时，他又像以前一样，为美国在朝鲜的侵略辩护。杜勒斯“要求”苏联和中华人民共和国放弃在朝鲜的某些“野心”，以此作为朝鲜人自己解决朝鲜问题的必要条件。同时他说，美国决不会找“任何藉口来利用朝鲜作为在亚洲大陆上建立一个军事前哨据点”。然而对于美国和李承晚签订的条约他却一字不提，而这个条约的内容正好驳斥了他上面所说的话。
    杜勒斯竭力为侵略的北大西洋联盟和其他的军国主义集团的存在辩护。他硬说这些集团带有“防御”性质。杜勒斯并为建立所谓“欧洲防务集团”辩护，他强调指出，这个集团“将把德国军事力量并入进来”。
    杜勒斯说，苏联在创造“新的国际气氛”的工作中，“应当作出比以往来得多的贡献”。他在演说里要求苏联和人民民主国家在朝鲜、德国和奥地利等一系列最重要的国际问题上放弃它们的原则立场。至于美国的政策，杜勒斯只是泛泛地说：“美国和其他国家也应该作出它们的贡献，并履行它们的义务。”然而，这“贡献”到底是些什么呢，杜勒斯就一声也不响了。
    杜勒斯在他的发言中，企图把德国问题迟迟不能解决以及对奥和约迟迟不能缔结的责任推到苏联身上。
    关于限制军备的问题，杜勒斯使人显然感到，美国目前不愿意裁减军备和武装部队。杜勒斯建议，目前的工作应仅限于“研究关于限制和管制一切种类的军备的问题”以及其他“技术性”和“准备性的工作”。
    杜勒斯在他发言的最后部分谈到重新审查联合国宪章的必要性。他指出，早在一九四八年，美国参议院就通过了一项决议，要求在安全理事会讨论“有关和平解决国际争端和接受新会员国的问题”上取消否决权。他并指出，美国参议院今年通过了一项决议，指派一个“特别委员会”来“研究修改宪章的建议”。他力图把事情说得好像美国要求修改联合国宪章乃是为了加强联合国。然而，杜勒斯却不能否认这样一个明显的事实，就是为了加强联合国并使它成功地解决一切重大任务，恰恰就要严格地遵守宪章，而决不是要靠准备重新审查宪章的办法来破坏宪章。
    杜勒斯的发言有很多地方攻击苏联、中华人民共和国和欧洲各人民民主国家。
