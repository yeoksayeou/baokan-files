Editorial:

    The agricultural loans issued by the state this year, including the accumulated figures from the past few years, total nearly ten trillion yuan, far exceeding the amount issued in previous years. In order to make good use of this fund, the State Council of the Central People's Government issued the "Instructions on Issuing Agricultural Loans," putting forward guidelines and policies suitable for the current situation. We must implement the instructions of the State Council so that agricultural loans can play a greater role.
    The basic purpose of the state's issuance of agricultural loans at this time is to help farmers, mainly to support poor farmers, develop agricultural production, carry out economic struggles with usurers, and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. After the land reform, some poor farmers still have many difficulties in production and life, which are not easy to solve without state assistance. It is also difficult for small-scale farmers to carry out any major reforms in technology without state support. The current issuance of agricultural loans must serve these two requirements of supporting production. In the past few years, various localities have implemented this policy in the work of issuing agricultural loans, and have also achieved considerable results in their work. However, several errors and shortcomings have occurred in the methods of implementing this policy. The main ones are disregarding the specific conditions of the rural economy, emphasizing both top-down unified arrangements and planned loans, dedicated funds, and mostly lending in kind. Therefore, the issuance of loans often deviates from actual needs, becomes a burden on the masses, and turns a good thing into a bad thing. For example, a large number of loans for new-style farm implements, livestock, well-digging, and farmland water conservancy construction were issued in the past, which are needed by some masses in some areas; but they are not needed by other areas and other masses. Some of them are not needed today but will be needed tomorrow; some need this kind but not another; and some are only needed under certain working conditions. In a vast ocean of extremely dispersed small-scale agriculture like ours, it is very difficult to conduct surveys and statistics, and therefore it is impossible to prepare a complete and accurate plan. If we insist on issuing loans according to subjectively formulated plans, we are bound to run into obstacles. In order to make loans suitable for the needs of the masses, there is only one way, and that is to rationally distribute the loans to the masses themselves for their own use, and to carry out necessary guidance, supervision, and education work from the economic and political aspects to ensure the correct use of the loans.
    The State Council's instructions stipulate that the methods of absolutely planned, dedicated, and mainly lending in kind should be abolished in the future issuance of agricultural loans; instead, the method of maintaining a general plan, issuing according to local needs, allowing the masses to dispose of the loans themselves, and mainly issuing cash should be adopted. After issuing loans, local people's governments can regulate the use of loans through market economic activities, and promote state-owned trading companies and rural supply and marketing cooperatives to adapt to the needs of local farmers, organize the supply of means of production and means of livelihood, and at the same time, lend a certain amount of agricultural loans to local handicraftsmen to organize the production of agricultural means of production, so that farmers can buy the satisfactory items they want in time after receiving loans. Regarding the loan period, different repayment periods are also stipulated according to the other party's economic situation and the use of funds. This corrects the bias of "only lending to or lending more to wealthy farmers, and not lending to or lending less to poor farmers" that occurred at the lower levels due to overemphasizing borrowing and repayment in the past. Under today's conditions, this method is practical and effective, and it will surely win the support of the farmers. It will help us correct past shortcomings, greatly reduce the style of coercion and commandism, and improve the role of loans.
    The State Council's "Instructions on Issuing Agricultural Loans" also stipulates:
    "In some areas, it is necessary to issue more equipment loans or lend in kind according to the requirements of farmers, while in general areas, more general loans should be issued." This provision is to correct another shortcoming in the loan work, that is, in the past, due to emphasizing the dedicated use of production equipment loans, the urgent needs of poor farmers for food and deaths from illness were neglected. In fact, when farmers are in extreme difficulties in life, they are not only unable to carry out production, but also suffer from the exploitation of usurers and are on the verge of bankruptcy. The reason why farmers borrow money from usurers is mostly not out of the desire to add production equipment, but to tide over the difficulties of food shortages, diseases, and deaths. Therefore, the increase in general agricultural loans will help to combat the activities of usury, directly support farmers in difficulties, maintain their productivity, and facilitate the development of production. Of course, with the development of the rural economy, the number of poor farmers will gradually decrease, and the savings of the vast number of farmers will gradually increase. Their demand for adding production equipment will definitely gradually increase, and the state should gradually increase equipment loans. In the near future, equipment loans will account for the largest proportion of national agricultural loans, which is certain. It is also wrong not to estimate this trend and not to prepare to complete the tasks in this area. It must also be understood that farmers have many difficulties in production and life, and these difficulties cannot be expected to be solved centrally by the loans issued by the state. Therefore, in conjunction with the issuance of state loans, the credit cooperative business should be steadily developed in order to meet the economic turnover requirements of the masses according to local conditions and people. Relying on the economic strength of the masses' mutual assistance and cooperation to eliminate and combat the exploitative behavior of usurers is one of the important organizational tasks to help farmers solve their production and living difficulties.
    The distribution of agricultural loans between mutual aid and cooperation organizations and individual farmers is an extremely important issue in the agricultural loan policy. The issuance of national agricultural loans should facilitate the promotion of the socialist transformation of agriculture. But we cannot simplify the policy of agricultural loans for this reason, and we cannot adopt the mechanical method of "giving loans to those who are organized" and "not giving loans to those who are not organized." Because this method will alienate agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups from individual farmers, will cause dissatisfaction among individual farmers towards the government, and will cultivate the mentality of some production cooperatives and mutual aid groups to rely on loans and relax the work of improving management, which will also adversely affect the development of the entire mutual aid and cooperation movement. Therefore, at present, when issuing agricultural loans, we must make a reasonable distribution between organized farmers and individual farmers, and implement the principle of taking both sides into consideration. The so-called reasonable distribution means that on the one hand, we should give priority to meeting the loan requirements of organized farmers, because they are creating a new production system, are working hard to improve production equipment, and they need more loans; on the other hand, we should also meet the requirements of individual farmers, because some of them have difficulties in production and life, and helping them to solve these difficulties and avoid the oppression of poverty is more conducive to promoting them to respond to the call of the Party and the government and join the mutual aid and cooperation movement. This will encourage organized farmers, and individual farmers will also receive care and love. In fact, this is also "lending loans to those farmers who really need loans for the development of production" and "lending loans to those poor farmers who have difficulties in production and life and need loans to help them." Under the capitalist system, banks also issue loans, and its purpose is to help landlords and rich peasants exploit farmers, resulting in the polarization of farmers. However, our issuance of agricultural loans is to help farmers solve difficulties, reduce polarization, and promote them to rise together in production and life. Therefore, as long as there are poor farmers in rural areas, whether they participate in mutual aid and cooperation or operate independently, the government must care for them and help them in all aspects, so that they can have the opportunity to develop production and improve their lives like other farmers; it is completely wrong to be indifferent to their difficulties. In addition to farmers, salt workers, fishermen, and boat people should also be given appropriate loan assistance. These people often encounter some special difficulties during the transition period, and their production is indispensable to the national economy.
    Of course, the change in the practice of issuing agricultural loans does not mean that the organizational tasks of the competent authorities and Party and government personnel have been reduced. If this concept occurs, a laissez-faire tendency will inevitably appear. We must use agricultural loans in the places where farmers need them most, and provide assistance according to the actual situation of the farmers. We must organize the supply of materials, investigate the requirements of farmers in various places for the types and quantities of materials, conduct in-depth investigations and research among the masses, and organize democratic discussions to determine appropriate proportions. We must issue loans in a timely manner when farmers need them most, so as not to miss the farming season; after issuing agricultural loans, we must strive to guide their use, check their effectiveness; and we must also recover the funds within a certain period of time to facilitate turnover in the next year. When carrying out the work of recovering loans, we must also conduct a thorough investigation of the farmers' repayment ability, and extend the repayment period for some loan farmers with particularly great difficulties to prevent mechanical urging. In order to make the issuance of agricultural loans able to adapt to the actual situation of various places, the Party and government leading organs at the county level must be given the power to adapt to local conditions, so that the county's banking institutions can master a certain amount of agricultural loan funds and issue and recover them on their own every year according to the specific situation. In our work, we must not only oppose the phenomenon of excessive interference in farmers, but also strengthen the necessary economic work and political guidance. There was a time when there was a phenomenon of disregarding production, issuing loans equally, and only issuing loans but not managing the use of funds in agricultural loan work, which resulted in reducing the role of agricultural loans. This is a laissez-faire tendency. Later, there was a period when the work of agricultural loans overemphasized the dedicated use of funds, one-sidedly emphasized helping to purchase production equipment without solving the farmers' living difficulties, which aroused the dissatisfaction of the farmers. This is actually the result of excessive interference with farmers. In the future, we must correct these two aspects of errors and do things better.
    According to reports from various places recently, a laissez-faire tendency of abandoning guidance has already occurred in the work of clearing up past old agricultural loans. Some new-style walking plows and waterwheels that were lent out could have been left in the hands of farmers for application after some technology transfer and repair of parts, but they were also taken back in their original form without doing the necessary work on the grounds of correcting coercion and commandism. This attitude is wrong. This phenomenon must also be prevented in improving agricultural loan work. We must make it clear to all comrades: Issuing agricultural loans is an extremely important policy of our Party in rural work, and it is an important measure to improve the enthusiasm of farmers, develop agricultural production, and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. This is by no means a purely technical work of lending and recovering money. People's governments at all levels should, in accordance with the instructions of the State Council, assist the People's Banks at all levels and district and township cadres to conduct a systematic policy study, so that they can truly understand that in the work of issuing agricultural loans, "it is only considered that the task is completed if the policy is implemented, production is developed, and the issuance and recovery of loans are guaranteed. On the contrary, although the planned figures for issuance and recovery are completed, but the policy is violated or the policy is not fully implemented, and it becomes a simple relief, or the 'borrowing and repayment' is overemphasized, and it actually becomes 'guaranteed borrowing and guaranteed repayment,' and no achievements are shown in supporting production, then it cannot be considered that the task is completed, and errors will be made in the work."

### 进一步做好农业贷款的工作

    进一步做好农业贷款的工作
    今年国家发放的农业贷款，包括过去几年积累数字在内，共计近十万亿元，远远超过了历年发放的数量。为了很好地运用这笔资金，中央人民政府政务院发布了“关于发放农业贷款的指示”，提出了适合当前情况的方针和政策。我们必须贯彻执行政务院的指示，以便使农业贷款发挥更大的作用。
    国家发放农业贷款在现时的基本目的是帮助农民，主要地是扶助贫农，发展农业生产，和高利贷者进行经济斗争，巩固工农联盟。在土地改革之后，部分贫农在生产和生活上还有许多的困难，离开了国家的扶助是不容易解决的。小生产的农民要想在技术方面进行任何重大的改革，离开了国家的支援也是难于完成的。当前农业贷款的发放，必须服务于这两项扶植生产的要求。几年来，各地在发放农贷工作中是执行了这一方针的，在工作中也取得不小的成绩。但在贯彻这一方针的方法上，却发生了若干错误和缺点。其中主要的是不顾农村经济的具体情况，既强调了自上而下的统一布置，又强调了按计划贷款、专款专用、大部贷实。因此，贷款的发放就往往脱离了实际的需要，成为群众的负担，把好事办成了坏事。例如，过去发放了大批的新式农具贷款、牲畜贷款、打井及农田水利建设贷款，这对于某些地区某些群众是需要的；但对于另一些地区和另一些群众则是不需要的。其中又有一些是今天不需要而明天需要的；有些是需要这一种但不需要另一种的；还有些是在一定工作条件下才有需要的。在我国这样一个极端分散的小农经济的大洋中进行调查统计是很困难的，因而编制一个完备的准确的计划也是不可能的。如果硬要按照主观拟订的计划去发放贷款是必然要碰壁的。为使贷款适合群众的需要，只有一个办法，这就是将贷款合理分配给群众自己支配，并从经济政治各方面进行必要的引导、监督和教育工作，以保证贷款的正确使用。
    政务院指示今后发放农贷应取消绝对按计划的、专款专用的、以贷实为主的办法；改为保持大体计划、按地方需要发放、由群众自行支配、并以发放现款为主的作法。各地人民政府在发放贷款后，可经过市场的经济活动以调节贷款的用途，并推动国营贸易公司、农村供销合作社适应当地农民的需要，组织生产资料和生活资料的供应工作，同时以一定数额的农贷贷予各地的手工业者，组织农业生产资料的生产，使农民在得到贷款以后，能够及时地买到他们所想买的称意的物品。关于贷款期限，也按对方经济状况和款项用途，做了不同的偿还期的规定。这就纠正了过去因过分强调有借有还而使下级发生的“只贷给或是多贷给富裕农民，而不贷给或少贷给贫苦农民”的偏向。在今天的条件下，这种办法是切合实际的和有效的，它一定会取得农民的拥护。它将帮助我们改正过去的缺点，大大减少强迫命令的作风，提高贷款的作用。
    政务院“关于发放农业贷款的指示”还规定：
    “在某些地区根据农民的要求多发放设备性贷款或贷放实物是需要的，在一般地区则应多发放一般性贷款。”这个规定是为了纠正贷款工作中的另一项缺点，即过去由于强调生产设备贷款的专款专用，而忽视了贫困农民缺乏口粮和疾病死亡等紧急的需要。实际上农民在生活极度困难的时候，不但无力进行生产，而且会因此遭受高利贷者盘剥而濒于破产。农民所以要向高利贷者借钱，大多数并不是出于增添生产设备的愿望，而是为了渡过口粮缺乏、疾病丧亡等不幸事故的难关。因此，一般性农业贷款的增加，将有助于打击高利贷的活动，直接扶助处于困难中的农民，维持他们的生产力，而利于生产的发展。当然，随着农村经济的发展，贫农的数量的日益减少，广大农民的积蓄的慢慢增多，他们对于增添生产设备的要求一定会逐步增长，国家应当逐渐增加设备贷款。在不久的将来，设备贷款将占国家农业贷款的最大比重，这是肯定的。不估计到这种趋势，不准备完成这一方面的任务也是不对的。还必须了解，农民生产、生活方面的困难是多方面的，这些困难还不能指望用国家发放的贷款获得集中的解决。因此，结合国家贷款的发放，稳步地发展信用合作事业，以便因地制宜、因人制宜地满足群众经济周转的要求。依靠群众互助合作起来的经济力量，排除与打击高利贷者的剥削行为，是帮助农民解决其生产生活困难的重要组织任务之一。
    关于农业贷款在互助合作组织和单干农民之间的分配，是农业贷款政策中的一个极为重要的问题。国家农业贷款的发放，应该便利于促进对农业的社会主义改造。但不能因此就把农业贷款的方针简单化，不能采取“组织起来的就给贷款”、“不组织起来的就不贷款”的机械办法。因为这种办法会使农业生产合作社和互助组脱离个体农民，会引起个体农民对政府的不满，会养成某些生产合作社和互助组依赖贷款的心理而放松了改善经营管理的工作，从而也就会给整个互助合作运动的发展以不利的影响。因此，目前发放农业贷款，必须在组织起来的农民和个体农民之间作合理的分配，实行双方兼顾的原则。所谓合理的分配，就是一方面应当优先满足组织起来的农民的贷款要求，因为他们正在创造一种新的生产制度，正在努力改进生产设备，他们需要较多的贷款；另一方面也应当满足个体农民的要求，因为他们当中有些人在生产、生活方面存在着困难，帮助他们解除这种困难，使他们避免贫困的压迫，更利于推动他们响应党和政府的号召，加入互助合作运动。这样就会使组织起来的农民得到鼓励，个体农民也受到关怀和爱护。实际上这也就是一方面“把贷款贷给那些为发展生产而确实需要贷款的农民”，同时又“贷给那些生产生活均有困难需要贷款加以扶助的贫困农民”。在资本主义制度下，银行也发放贷款，它的目的是帮助地主富农剥削农民，结果是促进农民向两极分化。而我们发放农贷，却是为了帮助农民解除困难，减少两极分化，推动他们在生产和生活方面共同上升。因此，只要农村中有贫农存在，不论他们参加了互助合作还是自己单独经营，政府都必须从各方面关怀他们，帮助他们，使他们和其他农民一样获得发展生产和改善生活的机会；对他们的困难漠不关心，是完全错误的。除了农民以外，对于盐民、渔民、船民也要给以适当的贷款扶助。这些人在过渡时期，常常发生一些特殊的困难，而他们的生产在国民经济中又是不可缺少的。
    当然，发放农业贷款的作法的改变，绝不是意味着降低了主管机关和党政人员的组织任务。如果有这种观念发生，必然会出现放任自流的倾向。我们要把农贷用在农民最需要的地方，根据农民的实际情况，分别给以帮助。我们要组织物资供应工作，要调查各地农民对物资品种和数量的要求，要深入群众考察研究，组织民主讨论，以确定合适的比例。我们要不失时效地在农民最需要的时候将贷款发放出去，做到不误农时；在发放农贷之后，努力指导其用途，检查其效果；还要在一定时期把款收回来，便于下年周转。而在进行收回贷款的工作时，又必须切实调查农民偿还能力，对某些困难特大的贷款农民，分别延缓其偿还期限，防止机械催逼情形。为了使农业贷款的发放能够适应各地的实际情况，必须给县一级的党政领导机关以因地制宜的机动权，使县的银行机构能掌握一定数目的农贷基金，每年按照具体的情况，自行发放和收回。我们在工作中既要反对过分干涉农民的现象，又要加强必要的经济工作和政治指导。曾经有一个时期，农贷工作中发生过不管生产、平均发放和只管放款、不管用款的现象，其结果是降低了农贷的作用，这是放任自流的倾向。以后有一个时期，农贷工作中又发生了过分强调专款专用，片面地强调帮助购买生产设备而不解决农民的生活困难的现象，引起农民的不满。这在实际上是对农民过多地施行干涉的结果。今后必须纠正这两方面的错误，把事情办得更好些。
    近据各地反映，在清理过去旧农贷的工作中，已经发生了放弃指导的自流倾向。有些贷出去的新式步犁和水车，只要经过一番传授技术和整修零件的工作，原是可以留在农民手中加以应用的，却也以纠正强迫命令为理由，不做必要的工作，原封收回了。这种态度是不对的。在改进农业贷款工作中也必须防止这种现象。我们要向一切同志交代明白：发放农业贷款是我党在农村工作方面的一项极为重要的政策，是提高农民的积极性，发展农业生产，巩固工农联盟的重要措施之一。这绝不是一种单纯的放款收款的技术工作。各级人民政府应该根据政务院的指示，帮助各级人民银行及区乡干部进行一次系统的政策学习，使他们真正懂得在发放农贷工作上，“既贯彻了政策，发展了生产，又保证贷款的发放与收回，这才算完成了任务。反之，虽然完成了发放与收回的计划数字，但违反了政策或者不全面的执行政策，流于单纯救济，或过分强调
    ‘有借有还’，实际成为‘保借保还’，在扶助生产方面表现不出成绩，那就不能算完成任务，就会在工作中犯错误。”
