The Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government convened a National Railway New Line Work Conference from August 22nd to September 16th. The conference analyzed the basic situation of newly built railways, and based on the central government's policy and instructions of "increasing production, practicing strict economy, focusing on key construction, and advancing steadily," determined the future direction, tasks, and work arrangements for new line work.

Since 1950, when new railway construction began in New China, more than 1,400 kilometers of new railways have been built by 1952. Survey and design and construction organizations were established, and tens of thousands of technicians, workers, and cadres were trained, accumulating experience. However, there are still shortcomings and weaknesses in design and construction. After summarizing the past work, the conference further discussed how to complete the state's First Five-Year Plan and the preparation for next year's new railway construction. The conference determined that the future construction policy for new lines is: "Strengthen design, rectify construction, improve quality, advance steadily, learn planned management and economic accounting systems within a certain period of time, establish and improve survey and design and engineering management systems, so that new line work can complete the tasks assigned by the state under the comprehensive requirements of ensuring construction quality, shortening construction periods, and reducing construction costs, that is, 'good, fast, and economical.'" It was also determined that in the last three months of this year, all units should concentrate their efforts to complete the adjusted annual plan tasks on the premise of ensuring quality, while strengthening the preparation for planned management, submitting production plans to the masses for discussion, organizing labor competitions, consolidating labor discipline, conscientiously learning from Soviet experience, implementing Soviet expert suggestions, and promoting advanced working methods to improve labor productivity and reduce engineering costs, and to prepare next year's annual plan, arrange the work for the first quarter of next year, and prepare for the start of construction next year. The conference also focused on discussing the issue of planned management, clarifying the importance of planned management to new lines and the work steps from shallow to deep, and from simple to detailed.

At the meeting, several Soviet experts made detailed analysis reports on comprehensive design, mechanization of large and medium bridge and culvert projects, winter construction, and project contracting, subcontracting, and acceptance, combined with the actual situation of various bureaus.

The conference determined the tasks of political work and trade union work for new lines. The conference also studied and discussed issues such as cadre training, employee living supplies, and material supply. At the meeting, comrades from various bureaus also made special reports, exchanged on-site survey and design, construction experience, and inventions and creations of some advanced employees.

    中央铁道部召开全国铁路新线工作会议
    【本报讯】中央人民政府铁道部在八月二十二日到九月十六日召开了全国铁路新线工作会议。会议对新建铁路的基本情况进行了分析，根据中央“增加生产、厉行节约、重点建设、稳步前进”的方针和指示，确定了今后新线工作的方针、任务和工作部署。
    新中国铁路新线建设自一九五○年开始，到一九五二年，修建了新铁路一千四百多公里，建立了勘测设计与施工机构，培养了数万技术工人和干部，积累了经验。但是在设计和施工等方面，还存在着缺点和弱点。会议在总结了过去的工作以后，进一步讨论了如何完成国家第一个五年建设计划和明年新建铁路准备工作的问题。会议确定今后新线的建设方针是：“加强设计，整顿施工，提高质量，稳步前进，在一定时期内学会计划管理和经济核算制，建立与健全勘测设计和工程管理制度，使新线工作在保证建设质量、缩短建设期限、降低建设成本，即‘好、快、省’的全面要求下，完成国家给予的任务。”并确定：在今年最后三个月内，各单位应集中全力，在保证质量前提下，努力完成调整后的年度计划任务，同时加强计划管理的准备工作，把生产计划，交给群众讨论，组织劳动竞赛，巩固劳动纪律，认真学习苏联经验，执行苏联专家建议，推广先进工作方法，以提高劳动生产率，降低工程成本，并要做好明年的年度计划，布置明年第一季度的工作，做好明年开工的准备工作。会议还着重讨论了计划管理问题，明确了计划管理对新线的重要性和由浅入深、由简单到细致的工作步骤。
    会上，有几位苏联专家分别对综合设计、大、中桥涵工程机械化、冬季施工、以及工程发包、承包、验收等问题，结合目前各局实际情况，作了详尽的分析报告。
    会议确定了新线政治工作和工会工作的任务。会议还对培养干部问题，职工生活供应和材料供应等问题，进行了研究和讨论。在会上还由各局同志作了专题报告，交流了现场勘测设计、施工经验和一些先进职工的发明创造。
