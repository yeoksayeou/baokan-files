    The Guanting Reservoir withstood its first flood test. The tall and sturdy dam blocked the second largest flood on the Yongding River since hydrological records began. On the evening of August 25th, due to torrential rains in the Sanggan River basin, the river water in the upper reaches of the Yongding River surged sharply. At 2:00 PM on the 26th, the peak flow of the flood into the Guanting Reservoir reached 3,700 cubic meters per second, and the total flood volume was approximately 450 million cubic meters. At 8:00 PM on the 27th, the highest water level in the reservoir reached 463.76 meters (based on the Dagukou sea level datum), extending upstream along the Gui River to near Huailai City, and upstream along the Yongding River to the Yongding River Bridge approximately ten kilometers above Guanting, forming a man-made lake with an area of 40 square kilometers. The Guanting Reservoir fully demonstrated its flood control effectiveness during this flood test, allowing the turbulent floodwaters to flow out obediently through the water diversion tunnel. As a result, the flood disaster for the people on both banks of the lower reaches of the Yongding River was greatly reduced, and the Beijing-Tianjin railway traffic remained unimpeded.
    During the flood control period at the Guanting Reservoir, the sediment measurement team worked day and night to conduct observations of the reservoir, obtaining data on the reservoir's flood storage and sediment discharge. The water level in the reservoir gradually decreased from the evening of the 27th. All employees are now continuing their efforts to complete the fourth phase of the dam, spillway, and intake tower projects. (Xinhua News Agency)

    官厅水库拦河坝挡住了第一次洪水
    官厅水库经受了第一次洪水的考验，高大坚固的拦河坝挡住了永定河有水文记载以来的第二次大洪水。八月二十五日晚上，由于桑干河流域暴雨，永定河上游区域河水猛涨。二十六日下午二时，流入官厅水库的洪水最高流量每秒钟达三千七百立方公尺，洪水总量约为四亿五千万立方公尺。二十七日下午八时，水库内的最高水位达到四百六十三点七六公尺（大沽海平面基点），沿妫水河上溯到达怀来城附近，沿永定河上溯到达官厅以上约十公里的永定河大桥，形成了面积达四十平方公里的人造湖泊。官厅水库在这次洪水考验中充分发挥了拦洪的效用，使汹涌澎湃的洪水驯服地从输水隧洞里流了出去。因此，永定河下游两岸人民洪水灾害大大减轻，京津铁路交通也畅通无阻。
    官厅水库拦洪期间，泥沙测验工作队昼夜不停地进行水库的观测工作，获得了有关水库蓄洪、排沙的资料。水库内水位自二十七日晚起逐渐降落。全体员工现正再接再厉地为全部完成拦河坝、溢洪道和进水塔的第四期工程而斗争。（新华社）
