Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, September 27th: After holding the Increase Production and Practice Economy Mobilization Meeting on September 16th, the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee immediately organized five inspection teams—industry, capital construction, finance and trade, agriculture, and government organs—led by Municipal Committee Secretary Huang Oudong and specifically guided by various Municipal Committee members. These teams went deep into the grassroots to conduct inspections.

　　The industry inspection team was divided into twenty-four subgroups, composed of 141 cadres drawn from the city's Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League organizations, as well as the Northeast Office of the central industrial ministries and various industrial bureaus (sub-bureaus). They have gone separately to twenty-four key state-owned and local state-owned factories, or factories with more production difficulties, to conduct inspections. The main contents of the inspection are the factories' completion of the state plan from January to August, identifying experiences and existing problems; whether the factories' revised Increase Production and Practice Economy plans are advanced and feasible, and whether corresponding technical organizational measures plans and team guarantee plans have been revised; the factories' experiences in increasing production and practicing economy, and strengthening planned management and technical management, as well as existing problems, etc. Before the industry inspection team went to the factories, the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee pointed out to the team: the purpose of the inspection is not only to discover problems, but more importantly to help the factories vigorously solve problems. The inspection method must be a working method that combines top-down leadership with bottom-up mass mobilization; each inspection team is required to adopt a "contracting" approach, working until the end of the year to help each factory comprehensively and balancedly complete the state plan and the Increase Production and Practice Economy plan.

　　The capital construction inspection team has begun a comprehensive "survey" of all projects in the city in order to identify weak links and provide assistance. Deputy Secretary of the Municipal Committee He Xia and others have gone deep into eight key construction sites to discover and solve problems. In addition, inspection teams sent to the other three departments have also gone deep into the field and begun inspection work.

    在进行增产节约动员以后
    中共沈阳市委组织检查组深入检查工作
    【新华社沈阳二十七日电】中共沈阳市委员会于九月十六日开过增产节约动员大会以后，紧接着组织了以市委书记黄欧东为首的、分别由各市委委员具体领导的工业、基本建设、财经、农业、机关等五个检查组，深入下层检查工作。
    工业检查组下分二十四个小组，由市的党、政、工、团的组织及中央各工业部驻东北办事处、各工业管理局（分局）等抽调的干部一百四十一人组成，已经分头深入到二十四个国营及地方国营的重点工厂或在生产上困难较多的工厂进行检查。检查的主要内容是各厂一月份至八月份完成国家计划的情况，找出经验和存在的问题；各厂修订后的增产节约计划是否先进可行，是否修订了相应的技术组织措施计划和小组的保证计划；各厂增产节约和加强计划管理、技术管理的经验以及存在的问题等。工业检查组在下厂前，中共沈阳市委会曾向该组指出：检查的目的，不仅是发现问题，更重要的是帮助各厂大力解决问题。检查的方法，必须是自上而下有领导的和自下而上发动群众相结合的工作方法；要求各检查小组采取“包干”方式，一直工作到年底，以帮助各厂全面均衡地完成国家计划和增产节约计划。
    基本建设检查组已开始了对全市各个工程全面地进行“摸底”，以便发现薄弱环节，进行帮助。市委副书记何侠等已分别深入到八个重点工程工地发现并解决问题。另外派到其他三种部门的检查组，现在亦已深入现场，开始检查工作。
