Xinhua News Agency, September 27th: The Chinese Academy of Sciences, the All-China Federation of Scientific Societies, and the Central Institute of Health jointly held an expanded commemoration meeting on September 26th and 27th to commemorate the 104th anniversary of the birth of the great Soviet physiologist Pavlov (September 26th). More than 800 people from over 120 units participated in the commemoration ceremony, including relevant research units affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, relevant societies affiliated with the All-China Federation of Scientific Societies, the Central Institute of Health, medical and health institutions directly under the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, the Pavlovian Theory Study Group, and relevant universities and colleges in Beijing.

The commemoration ceremony was presided over by Professor Zhao Yibing, Chairman of the Chinese Physiological Society. At the commemoration ceremony on the 26th, President Guo Moruo of the Chinese Academy of Sciences first delivered a memorial speech. Soviet expert Aleksandrov was also invited to the meeting to give a report on "Pavlov's Life and Contributions."

President Guo Moruo first extended, on behalf of the Chinese scientific community, the highest respect to Academician Pavlov for his great contributions to modern science and his noble spirit of loving his motherland and people, to the outstanding Soviet science that benefits mankind, and to the great Russian nation and all the Soviet people who produced such a great scientist as Academician Pavlov.

President Guo Moruo detailed Academician Pavlov's great spirit of engaging in scientific research throughout his life and his contribution to the world's humanity. He said: Pavlov's creative theory of higher nervous activity is a valuable asset shared by the working people of the world. The working people of the world have gradually realized the great significance of Pavlov's theory in scientific theory and medical practice. He called on everyone to study Pavlov's theory and apply and promote it to our various life activities, especially to the work of physiology, psychology, medicine, pedagogy, linguistics, physical education, and animal husbandry. At the same time, we must also apply Pavlov's theory as the guiding ideology of our biological science work, because it can help us eliminate the idealistic poison in scientific work, improve our scientific working methods, and enable us to more deeply appreciate the "universally applicable" universal truth of dialectical materialism.

Finally, President Guo Moruo pointed out: Pavlov is not only a world-renowned natural scientist, but also a noble patriot and a fighter for world peace. Now that we are in an era that provides us with more favorable conditions for studying Pavlov's theory, we must further appreciate Pavlov's noble spirit, we must study Pavlov's theory to serve the construction of our great motherland, to serve the industrialization and socialist transformation of the motherland, to strive for the realization of lasting world peace, and to commemorate Pavlov with this!

Next, Soviet expert Aleksandrov reported, introducing Pavlov's life, explaining Pavlov's tenacious spirit of persevering in scientific research under very difficult conditions in the past, and the cordial care and assistance given to him by the Soviet Party and government after the victory of the October Socialist Revolution, as well as the prosperous development of his theory in the Soviet Union. He said that Pavlov's life and career are also the life and career of a great patriot of his motherland, the life and career of a great scholar, revolutionary, and defender of materialism.

A report meeting on Pavlovian theory was held on the 27th. In the medical section, medical experts Zhong Huilan, Ji Suhua, Zhu Futang, Lin Qiaozhi, and others who attended the World Medical Conference reported on the application of Pavlov's theory in internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, and obstetrics and gynecology, respectively. In the physiology section, Cai Qiao, Feng Depei, and Shen Jichun gave special reports on "Research on Sleep," "The Connection between Weigensky's Theory and Pavlov's Theory," and "The Problem of Neurohumoral Regulation," respectively.
