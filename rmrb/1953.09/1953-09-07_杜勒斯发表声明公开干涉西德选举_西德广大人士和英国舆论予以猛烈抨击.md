Xinhua News Agency, September 6th: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles openly interfered in the West German Federal Assembly elections, scheduled for September 6th, at a press conference on September 3rd, expressing his support for the Adenauer group. Dulles said that if the coalition government led by Adenauer could not continue to be maintained, it would have extremely unfortunate implications for the hope of Germany achieving unification and restoring its sovereignty.

Dulles' blatant interference in the internal political affairs of another country immediately provoked a strong reaction in West Germany.

According to a TASS dispatch: Dr. Josef Wirth, Chairman of the League of Germans Fighting for Unity, Peace, and Freedom and former Chancellor of the Weimar Republic, sharply criticized Dulles at a press conference on September 4th for attempting to use intimidation to prevent West German voters from voting against Adenauer. Wirth said: "The German people are extremely indignant upon learning that Secretary of State Dulles has given Adenauer such assistance, attempting to enable him to continue pursuing his violent policies for the next four years. This attempt to influence voters is unprecedented." Dr. Wirth emphasized that "Dulles is not the overlord of the German people. His threatening baton should be a clear warning to all the German people and all the European people: do not allow yourselves to fall into the trap of American policy."

Dr. Gustav Heinemann, Chairman of the All-German People's Party, also protested Dulles' statement. Heinemann said, "Dulles' bluster and empty threats are the latest manifestation of American policy. He says we must obey, and our 'freedom of action' is to obey American orders."

The West German German News Agency reported that Erich Ollenhauer, Chairman of the German Social Democratic Party, considered Dulles' statement on the West German elections to be the most inappropriate example of interference in another country's internal affairs ever. Wilhelm Mellies, Vice-Chairman of the German Social Democratic Party, also said that Dulles' statement was "brazen interference" in German internal affairs. Dr. Arndt, a member of the German Social Democratic Party in the Federal Assembly, sent a telegram to U.S. High Commissioner to West Germany, Conant, protesting "Secretary of State Dulles' interference in the German elections," which was an insult to the German people. The telegram said that he should remember that Western countries, through general treaties and occupation regulations, refused to grant West Germany freedom and equality.

The German News Agency reported that the "Hanover News" said in an article entitled "America's Brazen Interference in the Election Campaign": Dulles' statement "is generally regarded as an act of American interference in German internal affairs, an open act of foreign aid to the Adenauer government."

The German Social Democratic Party's press office opposed Dulles' threats to West German voters in a statement, saying that Dulles, from the bottom of his heart, opposed the peaceful reunification of Germany, and he knew that Adenauer was faithfully carrying out his orders.

British newspapers also published many commentaries and news reports on Dulles' statement on the West German elections, pointing out that Western Europe generally regarded it as an act of interference in another country's internal affairs. A "Times" editorial said diplomatically: "Words that may sound simple and clear in St. Louis or Washington may arouse suspicion and unease when analyzed in London, Rome, or Bonn." A "Daily Herald" editorial believed that Dulles' act of interference "brazenly violated international courtesy" and was "extremely rash" and "very stupid." A "Daily Mirror" editorial said: "Now is the time for responsible people in America to realize that they should never manipulate the elections of other nations... America cannot rule the West. The West has not been sold to them."

Even American newspapers and bourgeois political representatives could not conceal Dulles' crude interference in the internal affairs of other countries and expressed concern about its consequences. "Washington Star" reporter Rope reported: "Allied diplomats are alarmed and disturbed by Secretary of State Dulles' open support for the Adenauer government, and everyone will certainly think this is an act of Americans interfering in the internal affairs of other countries... Secretary of State Dulles knows perfectly well that if a foreign diplomat in the United States said such things about the American elections, the United States would deport him." U.S. Democratic Senator Hill, commenting on Dulles' statement, said that he also agreed that Adenauer's election would be greatly beneficial to the United States. However, Hill said that it was a dangerous thing for foreigners, especially officials of other governments, to try to influence the elections of any country. A United Press International reporter in Washington reported that State Department officials privately worried that Dulles' statement supporting Adenauer might instead "harm the West German Chancellor."

According to Xinhua News Agency: "Pravda" reporter in Berlin, P. Naumov, reported on the situation of the United States arbitrarily interfering in the West German election campaign.

\tThe first to interfere in the election struggle was U.S. President Eisenhower himself, who sent a sensational "open letter" to Adenauer at the end of July. Then, three days before the election, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles declared at a press conference in Washington that if the current Bonn government coalition led by Adenauer was defeated in the election, the German people would suffer disastrous consequences.

\tIn West Germany, Dulles' statement is regarded as an act of American arbitrary interference in the West German election campaign.

\tThe Bonn group, emulating their masters, also frightened voters, saying that if Adenauer's alliance failed in the election, they would face dangerous consequences.

\t"Fulda People's News," referring to Adenauer's intimidation—saying that if his alliance failed, the Bonn state might be treated coldly by the United States—said angrily: "We want to ask, is our Chancellor a German or an American?"

    杜勒斯发表声明公开干涉西德选举
    西德广大人士和英国舆论予以猛烈抨击
    【新华社六日讯】美国国务卿杜勒斯九月三日在记者招待会上公开干涉将于九月六日举行的西德联邦议院选举，他表示支持阿登纳集团。杜勒斯说，假如以阿登纳为首的联合政府不能继续保持，对德国归于统一以及恢复它的主权的希望有极为不幸的影响。
    杜勒斯对于别国内部政治事务这一露骨的干涉，立即在西德引起猛烈的反应。
    据塔斯社讯：德国人争取统一、和平与自由联盟主席、前魏玛共和国总理约瑟夫·维尔特博士在九月四日举行的一次记者招待会上尖锐地抨击杜勒斯想以恫吓手段来阻挠西德选民投票反对阿登纳的企图。维尔特说：“德国人民在知道国务卿杜勒斯给予阿登纳这样的帮助，企图使他得以在今后四年中继续奉行他的暴力政策之后，感到极为愤慨。这种影响选民的企图是前所未有的。”维尔特博士着重指出，“杜勒斯不是德国人民的太上皇。他的警棍威胁对于所有德国人民以及所有欧洲人民说来，应该是一个明白的警告：不要让自己陷于美国政策的罗网。”
    全德人民党主席古斯塔夫·海涅曼博士也抗议杜勒斯的声明。海涅曼说，“杜勒斯的大肆咆哮和虚声恫吓是美国政策最新的体现。他说我们必须听话，我们的‘行动自由’就是服从美国的命令。”
    西德德意志新闻社报道说：德国社会民主党主席埃里希·奥伦豪尔认为杜勒斯关于西德选举的声明是历来所曾有过的最不适当地干涉他国内政的例子。德国社会民主党副主席威廉·米利斯也说杜勒斯的声明是“悍然干涉”德国内政。联邦议院德国社会民主党议员阿恩特博士致电美国驻西德高级专员康南特抗议“国务卿杜勒斯干涉德国选举”，这种干涉是对德国人民的侮辱。电报说，他应该想到，西方国家借助一般性条约与占领法规拒绝给予西德自由与平等。
    德意志通讯社报道，“汉诺威新闻报”在一篇题为“美国悍然干涉选举运动”的文章中说：杜勒斯的声明“被普遍认为是美国干涉德国内政的举动，是一个外国公开援助阿登纳政府的举动”。
    德国社会民主党新闻处在一篇声明中反对杜勒斯对西德选民的威胁，声明说，杜勒斯从心坎深处反对和平统一德国，他知道阿登纳是忠实地执行他的命令的。
    英国报纸对杜勒斯关于西德选举的声明也发表了许多评论和消息，指出西欧普遍认为这是干涉他国内政的举动。“泰晤士报”社论圆滑地说：“在圣路易或华盛顿听来可能是简单明了的话，在伦敦、罗马或波恩分析起来却可能引起怀疑与不安。”“每日先驱报”社论认为杜勒斯的干涉举动“悍然破坏了国际礼貌”，是“极端卤莽”、“非常愚笨”的行为。“每日镜报”社论说：“现在是美国的负责人士认识到他们决不应该操纵其他国家人民的选举的时候了……美国不能统治西方。西方没有卖给他们。”
    连美国报纸和资产阶级的政治代表也无法掩饰杜勒斯这种粗暴的干涉别国内政的行为，并对其后果表示不安。“华盛顿明星报”记者罗佩报道：“盟国外交官对于国务卿杜勒斯公开支持阿登纳政府感到惊惶不安，大家一定会认为这是美国佬干涉他国内政的举动……国务卿杜勒斯明明知道，如果
    一个外国外交官在美国对美国的选举说了这样的话，美国是会把他驱逐出境的。”美国民主党参议员希尔在评论杜勒斯的声明时说，他也同意阿登纳如果当选，会大有利于美国。但是，希尔说，外国人，尤其是他国政府的官员企图影响任何一国的选举是一件危险的事情。合众社驻华盛顿记者报道说，国务院官员私下担心杜勒斯支持阿登纳的声明可能反而会“害了这位西德总理”。
    据新华社讯：“真理报”驻柏林记者普·瑙莫夫报道美国专横地干涉西德竞选运动的情况。
    第一个出来干涉竞选斗争的就是美国总统艾森豪威尔自己，他在七月底发了一封轰动一时的“公开信”给阿登纳。接着，在选举前三天，美国国务卿杜勒斯在华盛顿记者招待会上扬言，假使目前的以阿登纳为首的波恩政府联盟在选举中被击败的话，德国人民将会遭到灾难性的后果。
    在西德，大家认为杜勒斯的声明是美国专横地干涉西德竞选运动的行为。
    波恩集团仿效他们的主子，也吓唬选民说，假使阿登纳的联盟在选举中失败的话，他们将会遭到危险的后果。
    “孚尔达人民新闻”谈到阿登纳的恫吓——说假使他的联盟失败，波恩国家可能会遭美国的冷遇——时，愤怒地说：“我们要问，我们的总理是一个德国人呢，还是美国人？”
