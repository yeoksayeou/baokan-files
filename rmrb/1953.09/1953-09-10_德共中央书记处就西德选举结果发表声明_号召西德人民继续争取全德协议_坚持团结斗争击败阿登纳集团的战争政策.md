(Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 9th) TASS, Dusseldorf dispatch from Deutsche Nachrichten-Agentur: The Secretariat of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party issued a statement on September 7 regarding the results of the Bundestag elections. The statement said: The Secretariat of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party discussed the results of the Bundestag elections on September 7 under the chairmanship of Comrade Max Reimann.

"The enemies of the Party and the people have used terror against the members of our Party who are campaigning, trying to break up election rallies, and even resorting to assassinations and brutal physical destruction. The Party expresses its condolences to Comrade Otto Müller (Fulda district), who died after being brutally beaten by fascist terrorist gangs. Many party members were seriously injured. This election struggle is reminiscent of the darkest period of the fascist dictatorship in 1933. Our Party's strong and courageous members not only showed perseverance in the face of this terror, but also joined with Social Democratic Party members and non-party workers to repel the terrorist offensive."

The statement continued: "Such a Bundestag poses a serious danger to our people and the people of our neighboring countries. This Bundestag will implement the Bonn and Paris military treaties in West Germany. The implementation of this policy will make the reunification of Germany impossible and directly threaten European peace. The newly elected Bundestag is many times worse than the previous Bundestag. The decisive forces in the new Bundestag are the forces of monopoly capital and banking capital, militarists, fascists and revanchist politicians, who have already caused our people to suffer twice and are now preparing for a third time."

The statement emphasized that only the resolute resistance of the entire German people, especially the working class, can stop the actions of this reactionary Bundestag and its "policy of armed rule at home and abroad." The statement pointed out: "On the first day after the Bundestag elections, Adenauer exposed the true nature of his policy, insisting that the voters had given him the power to implement the Bonn and Paris treaties. Once the Bonn and Paris treaties are implemented, West Germany will no longer be a peace-loving country. The peace-loving people of the world will not agree with Adenauer's aggressive policies in West Germany. They will correctly understand that the implementation of the 'European Defense Community' policy is a threat to their own security. The peace-loving people of all countries are resolutely and victoriously preventing the implementation of the US war policy in their own countries, and are intensifying their assistance and support for the cause of a reunified, peaceful, democratic and independent Germany."

Referring to the activities of the German Communist Party, the statement said: The election results show that the German Communist Party has not yet been able to overcome the remnants of fascist ideas, nationalism and chauvinism that stubbornly exist in certain sections of the population, and cultivate a truly democratic national consciousness. "Our Party has not been able to convincingly explain the significance and role of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic in the cause of defending peace and peacefully reunifying Germany. The election struggle proves that many people still understand our Party's policies based on the enemy's propaganda that distorts our Party's policies."

"The vacillation of the Social Democratic Party's leadership and its consistent concessions to Adenauer's aggressive policies have caused confusion... History has once again proved that the Social Democratic Party's leadership's anti-communist policy is an aid to reactionaries and imperialist aggressors. The German working class, all social democrats and patriots should draw extremely strict lessons from this: the slanderous propaganda against communists should be eliminated! The rumors against the Soviet Union should be eliminated! The rumors against the German Democratic Republic should be eliminated! All those who oppose Adenauer should unite against the new fascist terror!"

The statement concluded: "The election results of September 6 will not only fail to create a relaxed atmosphere in Germany and Europe, but will instead make the situation even more tense. The election results have made it difficult to peacefully reunify Germany. Therefore, the primary task of our people is to intensify the struggle for an agreement between the Germans and an agreement between the four major powers aimed at a peaceful solution to the German question. Forming an all-German provisional government with the main task of preparing and implementing free all-German elections is the most important step towards the rapid restoration of German unity on a democratic basis. This reactionary Bundestag will intensify the implementation of anti-labor, socially harmful policies. This reactionary Bundestag will not only fail to solve the problems of Germany's peaceful economy, but will instead worsen the situation of the broad working classes in cities and villages. The working class should rise up to defend its social and democratic rights, and should launch a struggle against Adenauer's anti-people policies. In view of the extremely dangerous situation in which our people find themselves, the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party calls on all Communist Party members to immediately contact comrades in the Social Democratic Party, the Christian Democratic Union and non-party comrades, and discuss with them the measures that should be taken to safeguard the national, democratic and social interests of our people. Now it is necessary to further strengthen the unity of the Party ranks and maintain closer ties with the masses. Nine million people, despite all kinds of terrorist means, opposed Adenauer's aggressive military policies. These nine million people are a great force. But the situation of giving up halfway and not implementing things to the end must be eliminated, and all those who oppose Adenauer must be united. They should rise up against Adenauer and stop him from implementing policies that harm Germany. In particular, the Social Democrats and Communists in cities, villages and enterprises who had united against Adenauer during the election struggle and have further understanding with each other should now unite more closely to make the power of the entire working class more active. Those who oppose Adenauer, all those who love peace and are patriotic, should not be confused by this election result, which was completely obtained by trickery. Now it is necessary to carry out large-scale explanatory work. No one can prevent the German people from carrying out the important task of the moment: to lead Germany on the road to peace and defeat the forces of aggression. If the people bravely fight for the unity of all patriots and those who oppose Adenauer, and unite with the pillar of democratic Germany - the German Democratic Republic - to carry out a resolute struggle for the immediate formation of an all-German provisional government, the people will have enough power. Then, the aggressive fascist forces will be restrained, the democratic forces of the whole Germany will be united, democracy will be guaranteed, the road to agreement with all peace-loving people of all countries will be opened, and Germany will be a peace-loving power in the big family of all countries’ people."

    德共中央书记处就西德选举结果发表声明
    号召西德人民继续争取全德协议
    坚持团结斗争击败阿登纳集团的战争政策
    【新华社九日讯】塔斯社柏林八日讯：据德意志通讯社杜塞尔多夫消息，德国共产党中央委员会书记处九月七日就联邦议院选举结果发表声明。声明说：德国共产党中央委员会书记处九月七日在马克斯·雷曼同志的主持下讨论了联邦议院的选举结果。
    “党和人民的敌人对我党进行竞选活动的党员采取恐怖手段，力图冲散竞选大会，并且不惜进行暗杀和残酷的肉体摧残。党对因遭受法西斯恐怖匪帮毒打而殉难的奥托·缪勒同志（孚尔达区）表示哀悼。有许多党员受了重伤。这次选举斗争使人想起一九三三年法西斯独裁统治最阴暗的时期。我党刚强而勇敢的党员不但在这次恐怖面前表现出了坚忍不拔的精神，而且与社会民主党党员和无党派工人共同击退了恐怖的进攻。”
    声明接着说：“这样的联邦议院对于我国人民和我国邻国的人民是一个严重的危险。这个联邦议院将在西德实现波恩和巴黎军事条约。这一政策的实现将使德国的恢复统一成为不可能，并直接威胁欧洲和平。这次选出的联邦议院比上届联邦议院还要坏许多倍。在新联邦议院中起决定作用的是垄断资本和银行资本势力、军国主义分子、法西斯分子和复仇主义政客，他们已经使我国人民两度遭受灾难，现在又准备来搞第三次。”
    声明着重指出：只有全体德国人民、特别是工人阶级实行坚决的反抗，才能够阻挡这届反动联邦议院的行动和它的“在国内外实行武力统治的政策”。声明指出：“联邦议院选举后的第一天，阿登纳就暴露了他的政策的真正性质，硬说选民已给了他实现波恩条约和巴黎条约的权力。波恩和巴黎条约一旦实现，西德就将不再是一个爱好和平的国家。世界上爱好和平的人民不会同意西德阿登纳的侵略政策。他们会正确地了解：‘欧洲防务集团’政策的实现是对于自己安全的威胁。各国爱好和平的人民正在他们自己国家内坚决、胜利地阻挡美国战争政策的实现，并加紧援助和支持恢复统一、和平、民主、独立的德国的事业。”
    声明在谈到德国共产党的活动时说：选举结果证明，德国共产党还没有能够克服固执地存在在某些阶层居民中的法西斯思想、民族主义和沙文主义的残余，而培养起真正民主的民族意识。“我们党没有能够令人信服地说明苏联和德意志民主共和国在保卫和平与和平恢复德国统一的事业中的意义和作用。选举斗争证明，许多人还在根据歪曲我党政策的敌人的宣传了解我党的政策。”
    “社会民主党指导部的动摇不定以及它对阿登纳侵略政策一贯的让步使人们产生混乱……历史又一次证明了，社会民主党领导集团的反共政策就是对反动派和帝国主义侵略势力的帮助。德国工人阶级、一切社会民主主义者和爱国主义者应该从这里吸取极严格的教训：应该绝灭对共产党人的诬蔑宣传！应该绝灭对苏联的造谣中伤！应该绝灭对德意志民主共和国的造谣中伤！一切反对阿登纳的人应该联合起来，反对新的法西斯恐怖统治！”。
    声明最后说道：“九月六日的选举结果不仅不会在德国和欧洲造成缓和的气氛，反而会使得形势更加紧张起来。选举结果给和平恢复德国统一造成了困难。因此，我国人民首要的任务就是加紧为达成德国人之间的协议和旨在和平解决德国问题的四大国之间的协议而斗争。组成一个以准备和实行全德自由选举为主要任务的全德临时政府，是走向在民主基础上迅速恢复德国统一的最重要的一步。这一届的反动联邦议院将加紧实行反对劳动人民、为害社会的政策。这一届反动联邦议院不但不能解决德国的和平经济的问题，相反，城市和乡村中广泛劳动阶层的境遇将更加恶化。工人阶级应该起来捍卫自己的社会权利和民主权利，应该发动反对阿登纳的反人民政策的斗争。鉴于我国人民处在十分危险的情况中，德国共产党中央委员会书记处号召所有共产党员立即与社会民主党、基督教民主联盟和无党派的同志们连络，并与他们讨论为保障我国人民的民族利益、民主利益和社会利益所应采取的措施。现在必须更加加强党的队伍的团结，并与群众保持更密切的联系。有九百万人不顾种种恐怖手段，反对了阿登纳的侵略性的军事政策。这九百万人是一个巨大的力量。但必须消除半途而废、不贯彻到底的情形，并要把一切反对阿登纳的人联合起来。他们应该起来反对阿登纳，阻止他实行危害德国的政策。特别是各城市、乡村和企业中的社会民主党人和共产党人曾在选举斗争期间联合起来反对过阿登纳并已经有了进一步的互相了解，现在应该更紧密地团结在一起，使整个工人阶级的力量更加积极起来。反对阿登纳的人、一切爱好和平与具有爱国主义精神的人不应该让这一次完全借骗局而得到的选举结果把自己弄得惶惑不安。现在应该去进行大规模的解释工作。没有人能够使德国人民不去执行当前重要的任务：把德国引向和平的道路并击溃侵略力量。如果人民勇敢地为团结一切爱国者和反对阿登纳的人而斗争，并与民主德国的支柱——德意志民主共和国联合起来为立即组成一个全德的临时政府而进行坚决的斗争，人民就会有足够的力量的。那时，侵略的法西斯力量就会受到约束，整个德国的民主力量就会团结一致，民主就有保障，与各国所有爱好和平的人民的协议的道路就会打开，而德国也就会作为一个爱好和平的大国列身于各国人民的大家庭中。”
