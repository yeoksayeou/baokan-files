Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 10th (TASS): The German News Agency reported that the Executive Committee of the League of Germans for Unity, Peace, and Freedom issued a statement regarding the results of the West German elections, calling on the ten million West German citizens who voted against Adenauer to intensify their struggle for peace, for the united front of democratic forces of the German people, and against the Bonn and Paris Treaties.

The statement pointed out that, due to the atmosphere of terror during the election, the League of Germans for Unity, Peace, and Freedom had no opportunity to meet with voters and explain the issues of Germany's fate. Furthermore, unheard-of slanders were spread against parties and political leaders advocating agreement; election rallies were intimidated by specially formed groups; and the authorities set up unprecedented obstacles to hinder the election campaigns of democratic parties. The absolutely undemocratic election law, regarding the clause of a minimum of five percent of the total votes, rendered invalid the votes cast for parties advocating East-West German agreement.

The statement mentioned the Soviet Union's recent note suggesting that the great powers reach an agreement on the issue of concluding a peace treaty with an independent and sovereign Germany. The statement said: This treaty will ensure that our people are not bound by any military alliance and will allow the Germans to regain the initiative in achieving unity. This proposal is gaining the support of an increasing number of people who desire peace. If we ourselves are prepared to defend this national demand, then even the Western countries will not be able to ignore this demand for long.

    德国人争取统一、和平与自由联盟发表声明
    号召西德人民团结反对阿登纳战争阴谋
     【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社柏林十日讯：德意志通讯社报道说，德国人争取统一、和平与自由联盟执行委员会就西德选举结果发表声明，号召一千万投票反对阿登纳的西德公民为争取和平，争取德国人民民主力量的团结一致，并为反对波恩与巴黎条约而加紧进行斗争。
    声明指出，由于选举进行时的恐怖气氛，使德国人争取统一、和平与自由联盟没有机会与选民见面，解释德国的命运问题。而且，对于主张协议的党派与政治领袖，有人散布前所未闻的诽谤；选举集会受到专门组成的团体的恫吓，当局设下史无前例的障碍来阻碍民主党派的选举运动。绝对不民主的选举法关于总票数百分之五最低选票的条款，使投给主张东西德协议的党派的选票归于无效。
      声明提到苏联在最近的照会中建议大国就与独立自主的德国缔结和约问题达成协议。声明说：这个和约使我们的人民将不会束缚于任何军事联盟，并将使德国人重新掌握取得统一的主动权。这个建议正得到越来越多的愿意和平的人的拥护。假如我们自己准备保卫这一民族要求，那么，即使是西方国家，也不能长时间地对这个要求置之不顾的。
