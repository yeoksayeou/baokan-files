    Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions
    Mobilizes Private Enterprise Workers to Launch Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign
    The Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions and various district trade unions are currently mobilizing private enterprise workers to actively respond to the Party's call, engage in the increase production and practice economy campaign, and begin formulating preliminary campaign plans.
    The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions convened an enlarged meeting of district trade union cadres to study methods for organizing and leading private enterprise workers to carry out the increase production and practice economy campaign.
    The District Committees of the Chinese Communist Party in Tianjin and various district trade unions are drafting preliminary plans for launching the increase production and practice economy campaign. Some districts are transferring cadres or holding short-term training courses for grassroots trade union cadres in order to send them to factories to carry out work. The Second District Trade Union has proposed a preliminary plan to organize 136 factories to carry out the campaign in September and to sign production contracts with 356 factories. The Eighth District Trade Union has decided to organize 40 trade union cadres to go to various factories to assist in their work, and will promote the 54 factories that have already signed production contracts to formulate group plans and individual plans. Currently, some workers in private factories have already taken action.

    天津市总工会
    动员私营企业职工开展增产节约竞赛
    天津市总工会和各区工会连日正动员私营企业职工积极响应党的号召，投入增产节约竞赛，并开始制订竞赛初步计划。
    市总工会召开了各区工会干部扩大会议，研究组织领导私营企业职工开展增产节约竞赛的做法。
    中共天津市各区区委和各区工会正在拟订开展增产节约竞赛的初步计划。有些区正在抽调干部，或举办工会基层干部短期训练班，以便派到各厂去进行工作。二区区工会已提出在九月份要组织一百三十六个工厂开展竞赛和在三百五十六个厂订立生产合同的初步计划。八区区工会已决定组织四十个工会干部到各厂去帮助工作，并将推动已签订生产合同的五十四个工厂订出小组计划和个人计划。现在，有部分私营工厂的职工已经行动起来了。
