    A Model of Revolutionary Heroism
    ——Commemorating the Tenth Anniversary of Julius Fučík's Death
    Lin Danqiu
    Ten years ago today (September 8th), Julius Fučík, the Czechoslovak national hero and outstanding communist fighter, was murdered by the Nazi bandits. Ten years is not a long time, but the changes in the world are profound. On the land where Julius Fučík and many other revolutionary martyrs shed their blood, the splendid flowers of freedom have blossomed, while the Nazi bandits' knives and gallows have long since turned to garbage along with the corpses of Hitler and his ilk. Human dignity is inviolable, and no force can stop the relentless judgment of history!
    Hundreds of thousands of people in our country have read "Report from the Gallows," [Note 1] encountered a truly heroic heart, and understood what kind of fighter and writer Julius Fučík was. In the dark period when the Hitler bandits occupied Czechoslovakia, in the Pankrác prison filled with "blood and moans," and with "the noose around his neck," he still used a pen and paper secretly given to him by a Czech in a Nazi uniform, calmly and passionately writing his "Report." He wrote about the ferocity and cowardice of the Nazi bandits, the bravery and strength of the imprisoned fighters, drawing a clear line between the spirit of man and "puppets," and shaping an immortal monument to the struggle between light and darkness during that period. As the Soviet writer Zaitsev said in "Immortal Work," this event itself is a great achievement. To complete such a feat in such a terrifying place requires such great wisdom and courage, such heroic spirit and revolutionary integrity, and such youthful and vital energy! However, for Julius Fučík, this was entirely understandable, because he understood and was able to do this: "A hero—is such a person who, at a crucial moment, does what is needed for the benefit of human society." [Note 2]
    This is the essence of revolutionary heroism, the source of revolutionary optimism, and a deep understanding and love for the people, boundless trust in the power of the collective, and a clear understanding of the bright future of mankind are the source of this source. Julius Fučík was the son of the Czechoslovak working people. He grew up under the glorious light of the Russian October Revolution and Soviet socialist construction, and in the revolutionary struggles of his motherland. His understanding and love for the working people were profound enough. During the difficult underground work period, he made the following conclusion through a concrete analysis of his country's history: "In the hearts of our people, there will always be an invincible force." [Note 3] In the Pankrác prison, he experienced the connection between the individual and the collective, the connection between "Cell 400" and the entire prison, the connection between the prison and the free world, the connection between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union, and the connection between "today in chains" and "tomorrow in freedom." On the morning of May Day, when several male and female comrades formed a "column" and performed a "review" with various movements while walking in the prison, Julius Fučík heard the loud chimes of the Kremlin and saw the colorful flags and chanting crowds in Moscow's Red Square. "Nine o'clock. Now the clock tower of the Kremlin has struck ten, and the review has begun on Red Square. Dear old father, we are with them! Now they are singing the Internationale. This song is resounding from all over the world, let this song also resound in our cells. We sing. We sing one revolutionary song after another. We are not willing to be alone, and we are not alone. Those who are now singing freely are with us, those who are now fighting like us are with us..."
    This is the light and heat of collectivism that spews out from the heart of a true hero!
    Heroes are examples for the people, and they are also members of the people. The power of the people, the power of the collective, is the inexhaustible source of his strength. Julius Fučík said it well: "Death is simpler than we imagine, there is no glorious halo in heroism. The battle is more cruel than we expected, and it takes immense strength to persevere and win. This strength is what we see every day, but we don't often realize it. ..." As long as you truly realize this power, you will be fearless, and you will be able to become a hero with great wisdom and courage. On the road of history, in the midst of cruel struggles, the people are moving towards victory day by day, while tyrants are moving towards death day by day. In the flashing of the enemy's swords, you can also see the rows of their graves. In the joy of collective life, you will forget the terror of individual death. It is easy to understand that Fučík "lived for joy and died for joy." The reason why Julius Fučík was not afraid of death was precisely because he loved life and living, and loved the beautiful future of mankind. He stood so high, saw so far, and saw so clearly that even with "the noose around his neck," he could not help but cheer for the victory of the people. The "Report" he wrote in the Pankrác prison is not only a ruthless mockery of the tyrants of mankind, but more importantly, a passionate ode to human life.
    Julius Fučík's joy was not easily obtained. There are no born heroes in the world, and there is no cheap heroic joy. The sharpness of a steel knife is inseparable from diligent and careful honing. Fučík grew up in an era of heroes, under the cultivation of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, and gradually acquired heroic qualities through long-term tireless study, selfless work, and unyielding struggle. True steel is always forged in the furnace. Precisely because of this, Julius Fučík was able to look at the connection between darkness and light, today and tomorrow, from a down-to-earth, realistic point of view, and understand that optimism "should not be based on falsehood, but on truth, on a clear prediction of undeniable victory," because "unfounded hope" "cannot make people strong, but rather makes them weak." To fight resolutely against the enemy in front of you, to overcome the difficulties in front of you in a pragmatic way, and to move yourself forward—this realistic path is the most solid bridge to a bright future. If there is a glimmer of light, one should generate a share of heat; after all, believers in communism are not religious people who stand idly by and look up to heaven. As Julius Fučík said in "On Heroes and Heroism," saving human lives, achieving new victories over nature, liberating useful members of society, revitalizing one's full strength, and improving people's various abilities—these are the fields of heroic activity. The reason why Julius Fučík refused to waste even a trace of his life, and even with "the noose around his neck," he still wanted to fight, still wanted to mock, still wanted to sing, and still wanted to write it down, lies here!
    Such heroes and heroism can only be produced in the ranks of the proletariat, and can only appear under the banner of the Communist Party. The birth and growth of such heroes and heroism is a clear sign of the glorious era of Lenin and Stalin. They overwhelm mountains and overturn seas, creating unprecedented miracles in human history. The decadent bourgeoisie also has its own "heroes," but stripping off their colorful "heroic" coats, what is left is often a naked, selfish and vulgar thing. In front of the people whose hands and feet are tied, he is a "hero" who dominates the world, but when he encounters the counterattack of the heroic people who have broken their chains, he trembles and has to sneak into the grave. Hitler is a typical example, and we will see a replica of this typical example again, no, we have already seen it! This is a cruel irony of heroes and heroism.
    Julius Fučík-style heroes and heroism are the example for all mankind to learn from and the locomotive that drives the wheel of human history forward. Julius Fučík's fighting career and immortal works have made a great contribution to the people of Czechoslovakia and the people of the world. People will always draw wisdom and strength from here, and draw the lofty spirit of revolutionary heroism and revolutionary optimism. The people of our country have suffered deeply under the iron hooves of domestic and foreign "heroes," have experienced long and moving battles, and have finally achieved the great victory of the people's revolution. Even in the joy of victory, we always remember Julius Fučík's passionate advice from the Pankrác prison: "People, I love you! You must be vigilant!" Yes, we must be vigilant!

    革命英雄主义的榜样
    ——纪念尤利乌斯·伏契克遇难十周年
    林淡秋
    十年前的今天（九月八日），捷克斯洛伐克民族英雄、出色的共产主义的战士尤利乌斯·伏契克被纳粹匪帮杀害了。十年的时间不算长，而世界的变化却是深刻的。曾经流过尤利乌斯·伏契克和其他许多革命烈士的鲜血的大地上，开放了烂漫的自由之花，而纳粹匪帮的屠刀和绞架，却早已跟希特勒们的腐尸一起化为垃圾了。人类的尊严不可侵犯，没有力量可以阻挡历史的无情的裁判！
    我国成千成万的人民读过“绞索套着脖子时的报告”〔注一〕，接触了一颗真正英雄的心，懂得尤利乌斯·伏契克是怎样的战士，怎样的作家。在希特勒匪帮占领捷克的黑暗时期，在充满“鲜血和呻吟”的庞克拉采牢狱里，在“绞索套着脖子”的时候，他依然用一个穿纳粹制服的捷克人偷偷送给他的笔和纸，沉着而热情地写着他的“报告”。他写出了纳粹匪徒的凶残和懦怯，写出了被囚战士的英勇和坚强，划清了人和“木偶”的精神界线，塑造了那个时期光明与黑暗搏斗的不朽的纪念碑。正如苏联哉采夫在“不朽的著作”一文中所说，这件事情本身就是丰功伟业。在那样恐怖的地方完成那样的丰功伟业，这需要怎样的大智大勇，需要怎样的英雄气概和革命气节，需要怎样的青春和生命的热力！然而对尤利乌斯·伏契克来说，这是完全可以理解的，因为他懂得而且能够做到：“英雄——就是这样一个人，他在决定性的关头做了为人类社会的利益所需要做的事。”〔注二〕
    这就是革命英雄主义的本质，就是革命乐观主义的思想感情的泉源，而对人民的深刻的理解和爱、对集体的力量的无限信任、对人类美好未来的真知灼见，又是这种泉源的泉源。尤利乌斯·伏契克是捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民的儿子，是在俄国十月革命和苏联社会主义建设的光辉的照耀下，在他祖国的革命斗争的锻炼中成长起来的，他对劳动人民的理解和爱是够深刻的。在艰难的地下工作时期，他曾通过祖国历史的具体分析，作过这样的结论：“在我国人民的心里永远有一种不可战胜的力量。”〔注三〕在庞克拉采监狱里，他体验到个人和集体的联系、
    “四○○号”牢房和整个牢狱的联系、牢狱和自由世界的联系、捷克斯洛伐克和苏联的联系、“系着锁链的今天”和“自由的明天”的联系。在五一节的早晨，当他们几个男女同志构成一个“纵队”，在狱内散步中用各种各样动作来进行“检阅式”的时候，尤利乌斯·伏契克听见了克里姆林宫的响亮的钟声，看见了莫斯科红场上五彩缤纷的旗帜和同声欢唱的人群。“九点钟。现在克里姆林宫的钟塔上敲了十下，在红场上开始了检阅式。老爸爸呵，我们是同他们一起的！现在那儿正唱着国际歌。这支歌从世界各处响了起来，让这歌声也在我们的牢房里响起来吧。我们歌唱着。唱完一个革命歌又唱一个。我们不甘孤独，而且我们也不是孤独的。那些现在自由歌唱着的人们是同我们在一起的，那些现在像我们一样进行战斗的人们是同我们在一起的……”
    这就是从真正英雄的心喷射出来的集体主义的光和热！
    英雄是人民的榜样，也是人民中的一员。人民的力量、集体的力量，便是他的力量的无尽泉源。尤利乌斯·伏契克说得好：“死要比我们想像的简单，在英雄主义上没有灿烂光辉的光圈。战斗是比我们所预料的更残酷，为了坚持下去并得到胜利，是需要无比的力量的。这种力量是我们每天都看见，但却不是常常能意识到。……”只要你真正意识到这种力量，你便无所畏惧，便有可能成为有大智大勇的英雄。在历史的道路上，在残酷的斗争中，人民一天天走向胜利，而暴君们则一天天走向死亡，在敌人的刀光剑影的闪耀中，你也可以看见他们的坟墓的行列。在集体的生的欢乐中，你便会忘掉个人的死的恐怖。伏契克“为欢乐而生，为欢乐而死，”那是容易理解的。尤利乌斯·伏契克之所以不怕死，正是因为他热爱生命和生活，热爱人类的美好的未来。他站得那么高，看得那么远，看得那么清楚，甚至在“绞索套着脖子”的时候，他也不禁为人民的胜利而欢呼。他在庞克拉采监狱里写成的“报告”，不仅是对人类暴君的无情的嘲笑，而更重要的是对人类生命的热烈的歌颂。
    尤利乌斯·伏契克的欢乐，不是轻易取得的。世上没有天生的英雄，没有廉价的英雄的欢乐。钢刀的锋利，与辛勤的、谨慎的磨砺分不开。伏契克生长在英雄的时代，在捷克斯洛伐克共产党的培养下，通过长期不倦的学习、忘我的工作和不屈不挠的斗争，才逐渐获得英雄的品质。真的钢铁总是在熔炉里锻炼出来的。正因为如此，尤利乌斯·伏契克才能用脚踏实地的现实主义观点去看黑暗与光明、今天与明天的联系，懂得乐观主义“不应当放在虚假上，而应当放在真实上，放在对无可怀疑的胜利的清清楚楚的预见上”，因为“没有根据的希望”“不能使人坚强，反而使人软弱”。坚定不移地跟眼面前的敌人作斗争，实事求是地克服眼面前的困难，使自己前进一步——这条现实主义的道路，便是通到美好的未来的最坚固的桥梁。有一分光，就应该发一分热，共产主义的信徒毕竟不是袖手仰望天堂的教徒。正如尤利乌斯·伏契克在“论英雄和英雄主义”一文中所说，挽救人的生命，达到对自然界的新胜利，解放社会的有用成员，振奋起自己的全力，提高人的各种能力——这些就是英雄活动的原野。尤利乌斯·伏契克所以不肯浪费一丝一毫的生命，而在“绞索套着脖子”的时候，还要斗争，还要嘲笑，还要歌颂，还要用笔写出来，那原因便在这里！
    这样的英雄和英雄主义只能产生于无产阶级的队伍中，只能出现于共产党的旗帜下。这样的英雄和英雄主义的诞生和成长，是光荣的列宁、斯大林时代的鲜明的标志。他们排山倒海，翻天覆地，创造着人类历史空前未有的奇迹。腐朽的资产阶级也有自己的“英雄”，但剥掉他的花花绿绿的“英雄”的外衣，留下的往往是赤裸裸的自私自利的俗物。在被缚住手脚的人民面前，他是叱咤风云的“英雄”，但碰到挣断了锁链的英雄的人民的反击，他便两膝发抖，不得不悄悄地往坟墓里钻。希特勒是一个典型，我们还要看见这个典型的翻版，不，我们已经看见了！这是对英雄和英雄主义的残酷的讽刺。
    尤利乌斯·伏契克型的英雄和英雄主义，才是全人类学习的榜样，是推动人类历史车轮前进的火车头。尤利乌斯·伏契克的战斗生涯和不朽遗作，对捷克斯洛伐克人民和全世界人民的贡献是巨大的。人们将永远从这里吸取智慧和力量，吸取革命英雄主义和革命乐观主义的崇高精神。我国人民曾在国内外“英雄”们的铁蹄下受过深重的苦难，经历过长期的可歌可泣的战斗，而终于取得了人民革命的伟大胜利。即使在胜利的欢乐中，我们也时刻记住尤利乌斯·伏契克从庞克拉采监狱中发出来的热情的忠告：“人们，我是爱你们的！你们可要警惕啊！”是的，我们要警惕！
