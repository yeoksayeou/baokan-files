The Beijing District Cooperative Business Organization Meeting, which opened on August 27th, concluded on the afternoon of September 5th after lasting ten days. Li Xiao, Deputy Director of the Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative, gave a preliminary summary report of the meeting at the closing ceremony.

The total transaction volume of this meeting was 72 billion yuan. Among them, the transaction volume of spot goods was 1.1 billion yuan; 490 contracts and 85 agreements were signed, with a transaction volume of 70.9 billion yuan. Among the commodities traded, there were 204 kinds of handicraft and industrial products such as iron shovels, iron pots, striped cloth, hairnets, chalk, and paper (more than 85 percent of which were handicraft products), worth 19.6 billion yuan; and 33 kinds of agricultural and sideline products such as wicker, fat pigs, eggs, and frozen tofu, worth 16.4 billion yuan. Through the meeting's transactions, the supply of goods for the autumn and winter peak season for cooperatives in the areas near Beijing was enriched. Cooperatives from various areas in the Tongxian Special District of Hebei Province purchased 10.9 billion yuan worth of various commodities at the meeting, solving a significant problem for the autumn and winter supply of goods.

At the meeting, rural supply and marketing cooperatives initially achieved a combination of production and sales with Beijing's handicrafts and local industries. Some traded spot goods, while others signed contracts or agreements, communicating production and sales information with each other and establishing regular business relationships, laying the foundation for opening up and expanding local sources of goods in the future. Because production and sales representatives met directly at the meeting, grassroots cooperatives directly procured goods from Beijing, reducing transportation links and saving costs, thereby lowering operating costs. According to farmers' requirements, cooperatives in various places put forward opinions on the specifications and quality of many handicraft products. For example, the blue scarves woven and dyed by hand in Beijing faded easily, and the neck would be dyed blue when sweating, so farmers did not like to use them; the small mirrors produced in Beijing were beautiful and cheap, which suited the farmers' preferences, but they were not strong, and the edges of the mirrors easily fell off. Cooperatives in various places also reflected that socks, towels, hairnets, thimbles, slates, slate pencils, writing brushes, inkstones, knives, scissors, and iron pots produced by Beijing's handicraft industry were very popular among farmers because of their good quality and specifications. These opinions made private handicraftsmen participating in the meeting clearly realize that only by improving product quality, reducing costs and prices, and facing the countryside can they have better development prospects. This will be of great help to the improvement of Beijing's handicraft production in the future. Through this meeting, representatives of cooperatives in various places also realized that it is necessary to vigorously organize the supply of goods, especially the production of handicrafts commonly used by farmers, according to the needs and purchasing power of farmers, in order to meet the diverse and growing needs of farmers.

This meeting also explored some experiences in holding successful cooperative business organization meetings. Li Xiao pointed out in the preliminary summary report of the meeting: To hold a successful business organization meeting within the cooperative, it is first necessary to find out the production and sales situation of local goods and make preparations such as collecting and exhibiting samples according to the requirements of the meeting. Secondly, it is necessary to convene specialized meetings on key commodities in a guided manner according to the needs of farmers and organize transactions in a planned way. Third, it is necessary to ensure that representatives of grassroots cooperatives and handicraft producers meet directly, so that production and sales parties are directly "linked." In addition, strengthening the organization and leadership of the meeting and political and ideological leadership is also very important.

This meeting also had some shortcomings. First of all, the preparation work was not sufficient. Among the exhibited samples, there were many summer goods and few winter goods, many goods needed by cities and few goods needed by rural areas, many children's toys and few household goods; some commodities needed by farmers, such as iron pots, had to be organized temporarily during the meeting. Secondly, in the early stage of the transaction, due to the lack of good organization of business transactions, the transaction fell into a state of free flow, buyers could not find sellers, and buyers and sellers could not find traders, which affected early transactions and prolonged the meeting time. In addition, the leadership of the conference lacked a unified work pace, and the problem-solving was not timely enough, which made the work chaotic.

    北京区合作社业务组织会议闭幕
    掌握地方工业和手工业品产销情况，便于开辟地方货源
    北京区合作社业务组织会议在八月二十七日开幕后，历时十天，已于九月五日下午闭幕。北京市供销合作总社副主任黎晓在闭幕典礼上作了会议的初步总结报告。
    这次会议成交总额七百二十亿元。其中成交现货十一亿元；签订合同四百九十份、协议八十五份，成交额七百零九亿元。成交商品中，有铁锨、铁锅、条格布、发网、粉笔、纸张等二百零四种手工业品和工业品（其中百分之八十五以上是手工业品），价值一百九十六亿元；有荆条、肥猪、鸡蛋、冻豆腐等三十三种农副产品，价值一百六十四亿元。通过会议成交，充实了北京市附近地区合作社供应秋冬旺季的物资。河北省通县专区各地合作社在会上采购了一百零九亿元的各种商品，对秋冬季货源解决了不小的问题。
    参加会议的农村供销合作社在会上和北京市手工业、地方工业初步作到了产销结合，有的成交现货，有的签订合同或协议，相互沟通产销情况，建立了经常的业务关系，为今后开辟和扩大地方货源打下了基础。由于在会上产销直接见面，基层合作社直接从北京进货，缩减了运输环节，节省了费用，因而降低了经营成本。各地合作社根据农民要求，对不少手工业产品的规格和质量提出了意见。如北京手工织染的蓝围巾，因为掉色，一出汗，脖子就被染上蓝色，农民不爱用；北京出产的小镜子漂亮、便宜，合农民的意，但是不结实，镜边很容易脱落。各地合作社也反映北京手工业生产的袜子、毛巾、发网、顶针、石板、石笔、毛笔、砚台、刀剪和铁锅等因质量、规格较好，很受农民欢迎。这些意见，使参加会的私人手工业者明确认识到只有改进产品质量，降低成本和价格，面向农村，才有更好的发展前途。这对今后北京市手工业生产的改进将有很大帮助。通过这次会议，也使各地合作社代表更加认识到必须根据农民的需要及购买力，大力组织货源，特别是组织农民惯用的手工业品的生产，才能满足农民多种多样、日益增长的需要。
    这次会议也摸索出了一些开好合作社业务组织会议的经验。黎晓在会议初步总结报告中指出：要开好合作社内部的业务组织会议，首先必须摸清地方货源的产销情况，根据会议要求，作好收集展览样品等准备工作。其次，必须根据农民需要，有领导地分别召开重点商品专业会议，有计划地组织成交。第三，必须尽量使基层合作社代表和手工业生产者直接见面，使产销双方直接“挂钩”。另外，加强会议的组织领导和政策思想领导也很重要。
    这次会议还有一些缺点。首先是准备工作不够充分。展览样品中，夏季货多、冬季货少，城市需要的货多、农村需要的货少，儿童玩具多，家庭用品少；有些农民需要的商品，如铁锅等，不得不在会议期间临时组织。其次，成交初期，由于没有很好地组织业务成交，交易陷于自流，买主找不到卖主，买卖双方找不到交易员，影响了及早成交，延长了会议时间。另外，大会领导缺乏统一的工作步调，解决问题不够及时，使工作陷于忙乱。
