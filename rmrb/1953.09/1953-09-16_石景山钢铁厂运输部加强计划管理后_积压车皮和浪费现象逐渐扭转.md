After strengthening its planning management, the Transportation Department of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has gradually reversed the accumulation of railcars and wasteful phenomena. In the past, the plant's production workshops' requests for railcars often exceeded actual needs, and some even treated railcars as material warehouses, frequently accumulating them. The Transportation Department's attitude was, "Don't refuse to provide cars when they are needed, but don't give them all that they ask for." For example, the ore screening yard of the Iron Smelting Department originally only needed eight railcars to transport ore, but it had consistently requested twelve, with four railcars loaded with ore kept in reserve. In the past, although the department submitted railcar request plans, the Transportation Department's car number clerks did not allocate cars according to the plan. Sometimes, when the blast furnace tapped iron, the Transportation Department could not deliver molten iron cars in time, affecting punctual tapping. The production workshops and transportation workshops were mutually dissatisfied.

Poor production management was another reason for the accumulation and waste of railcars. For example, due to an imperfect technical supervision system, after coke was loaded onto railcars at the coking oven and transported to the blast furnace to be unloaded into the material bin, the Iron Smelting Department deemed it unqualified and refused to allow it into the bin. Railcars accumulated for a long time until the factory director or the production technology section made a decision, and then the problem could be resolved. Sometimes, raw materials from outside the factory were not marked with their composition and could not be quickly analyzed, so they could not be unloaded in time, accumulating railcars. For example, on May 31, a railcar of machinery arrived, but the supply department did not know where it came from. That day was Sunday, and the owner of the goods could not be found, so the railcar was delayed for a whole day before being unloaded. Sometimes, production workshops requested railcars but did not coordinate well with the supply department. When the Transportation Department dispatched railcars, the material yard did not deliver the goods, causing difficulties for the Transportation Department's work.

As the entire factory emphasized the correct formulation of plans, the Transportation Department strengthened the review of railcar request plans and encouraged and assisted various units in correctly formulating railcar request plans. For example, in the supply section's August plan, they requested to transport 2,000 tons of scrap iron. The Transportation Department's planner, based on his understanding of the situation within the factory, believed that the number was too large and asked the supply section to consider it. As a result, it was changed to 1,500 tons, then to 1,000 tons, and after a day, the supply section automatically canceled this unrealistic plan. In the early stages of formulating daily plans, most units could not submit their plans within the prescribed time. For example, the Iron Smelting Department once submitted its plan four and a half hours late, so the locomotive waited in the warehouse for an hour and dared not move. At present, as production management is gradually normalized and the business of plan formulation personnel is gradually becoming more proficient, most can submit practical railcar request plans within the prescribed time, and the Transportation Department can dispatch cars in a timely manner according to the plan. It has also initially fixed the main recurring tasks, such as the transportation of ore screening, coke, chemical products, and oils, specifying the number of cars, frequency, and time of dispatch each day, making the work standardized. The number of railcars for this type of fixed work has now reached 50 percent. Secondly, the dispatching group has been strengthened, with the allocation of vehicles and loading and unloading manpower as the central link, and both sides implement forecasting. For example, the cargo clerk reports half an hour in advance when a material yard will load or unload what material and how much, and half an hour before loading or unloading is completed, the loading and unloading team leader notifies the dispatcher to facilitate timely car allocation and improve turnover rate. In the past, it often took two to three hours for cars to wait for people or people to wait for cars. Currently, it generally does not exceed a quarter of an hour.

The department's responsible cadres personally grasp and promote the work, listen to dispatch reports every morning, solve problems in the work, and frequently go to the front line to solve the ideological problems of employees and specific practices in a timely manner, thus enabling the production dispatch work to be carried out smoothly. Through such continuous efforts, transportation work has achieved great results: first, saving railcars and manpower. For example, the average loading and unloading volume per ton of pig iron in the first half of the year was 70 ton-kilometers, and in July it was reduced to 62 ton-kilometers. In the implementation of the operation plan, due to the accurate preparation of the railcar request plan, the car dispatch coefficient according to the plan in July was 85 percent, and in August it reached 90 percent, while in the first half of the year it was only 65 percent. The railcar turnover rate has also been improved. In July, six railcars were saved, of which only the three currently returned to the Railway Bureau can save more than 200 million yuan in car rental fees from August to the end of the year.

Now the Transportation Department is further solving the problem of working relations with the Railway Bureau outside the factory, improving the quality of the plan, and launching a production increase and thrift competition.

    石景山钢铁厂运输部加强计划管理后
    积压车皮和浪费现象逐渐扭转
    石景山钢铁厂运输部加强计划管理以来，车皮积压和浪费现象逐渐扭转。过去该厂生产车间的要车计划往往超过实际需要，有的甚至把车皮当料仓，经常积压车皮。运输部的态度是“要车时别不给，也别全给”。如炼铁部筛选场运矿石本来只需八个车皮，一直是要十二个，有四个车皮装着矿石备用。该部过去虽然编送要车计划，但运输部车号员却并不按计划配车。有时高炉出铁时，运输部不能及时送来铁水车，影响正点出铁。生产车间和运输车间互不满意。
    生产管理不良，是造成车皮积压和浪费的另一原因。如技术监督制度不健全，焦炭在焦炉装车后，拉到高炉卸入料仓时，炼铁部认为不合格，不让入仓，车皮积压很久，直到厂长或生产技术课作出决定后，这个问题才能解决。有时厂外来的原材料没有标明成分，又不能很快化验出来，不能及时卸车，积压车皮。又如五月三十一日来了一车机器，供应部门不知是从那里发来的，这天是星期天，也找不着货主，压了一天才卸车。有时生产车间要了车，但没有和供应部门联系好，到时候运输部派了车，料场不发货，造成运输部工作的困难。
    随着全厂强调正确编制计划的同时，运输部加强了对要车计划的审查，鼓励和协助各单位正确地编制要车计划。如供应课八月份计划中要运废铁二千吨，运输部计划员根据自己对厂内情况的了解，认为数字太大，要供应课加以考虑。结果改为一千五百吨，后又改为一千吨，隔了一天，供应课自动把这项不切实际的计划取消了。在编制日计划的初期，各单位大都不能在规定时间提出计划，如有一次炼铁部晚了四个半钟点提出计划，因此机车在库房等了一小时，不敢出动。目前随着生产管理的逐渐正常和编制计划人员的业务逐渐熟练，大都能按规定时间提出切合实际的要车计划，运输部也能按计划及时派车，并初步地把主要的经常的工作固定起来，如矿石筛选、焦炭、化学产品油类的输送等都规定了每天派车的数量、次数和时间等，使工作定型化。这种固定工作的车皮数量目前已达到百分之五十。其次，加强了调度组，以车辆和装卸人力的调配作为中心环节，双方实行预报。如某料场在甚么时候装、卸什么料及数量多少，货物员在半小时以前报告，在装完或卸完前半小时，装卸组长通知调配员，以便及时调车，提高周转率。过去车等人或人等车经常要二小时至三小时，目前一般的已不超过一刻钟。
    该部负责干部亲自掌握和推动工作，每天早晨听取调度汇报，解决工作中的问题，并经常深入现场，及时解决职工思想问题和具体作法上的问题，因此使生产调度工作能够顺利开展。经过这样不断的努力，运输工作取得了很大成绩：首先节省了车皮和人力，如上半年平均每吨生铁需要装卸量为七十吨公里，七月份降低为六十二吨公里。在贯彻作业计划中，由于要车计划编制准确，七月份按计划派车系数为百分之八十五，八月份达到了百分之九十，而上半年只有百分之六十五。车皮周转率也提高了，在七月份省下了六个车皮，其中仅目前已退路局的三辆，自八月至年底即可节省租车费两亿元以上。
    现在运输部正进一步解决与厂外路局的工作联系问题，提高计划质量，展开增产节约竞赛。
