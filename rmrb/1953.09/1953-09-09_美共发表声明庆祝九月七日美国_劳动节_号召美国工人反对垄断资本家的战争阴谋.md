    Xinhua News Agency, August 8th: According to TASS, the New York "Daily Worker" published a statement from the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States on celebrating the national holiday "Labor Day" on September 7th.
    The National Committee called on workers to fight for peace and severely criticized the behavior of upper-level leaders of the American labor movement in supporting the foreign policy of Wall Street monopoly capitalists. The statement said that the American working class is facing a dangerous political and economic situation. Wall Street monopoly capitalists are doing everything possible to intensify international tensions and undermine the hope of a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue. The statement said: In addition to the continued danger of war, the American people are also threatened by the "fascist - McCarthyist plague" and face the shadow of another major economic crisis.
    The statement concluded: "On this Labor Day, the central issue facing organized labor and its political allies is the struggle for peace. All other issues, such as the fight for increased wages, opposition to fascism, the struggle for labor unity, the struggle for independent political action, and the struggle to release imprisoned communists, are inextricably linked to the struggle against war."

    美共发表声明庆祝九月七日美国“劳动节”
    号召美国工人反对垄断资本家的战争阴谋
    【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社讯：纽约“工人日报”刊载了美国共产党全国委员会关于庆祝九月七日全国性节日“劳动节”的声明。
    全国委员会号召工人为和平而斗争，并严厉抨击美国工会运动上层领袖支持华尔街垄断资本家的外交政策的行为。声明说，美国工人阶级面对着险恶的政治与经济局势。华尔街垄断资本家正千方百计地图谋使国际紧张局势更加紧张，并且破坏和平解决朝鲜问题的希望。声明说：除了持续的战争危险以外，美国人民还受着“法西斯主义——麦卡锡主义毒瘤”的威胁，并面临着另外一次巨大的经济危机的阴影。
    声明最后说：“在此劳动节的时候，有组织的劳工和它的政治盟友所面对的中心问题是为和平而斗争。所有其他问题，如争取增加工资、反对法西斯主义、争取劳工团结、争取独立的政治行动、争取释放被囚禁的共产党人的斗争，都是与反对战争的斗争不可分地联在一起的。”
