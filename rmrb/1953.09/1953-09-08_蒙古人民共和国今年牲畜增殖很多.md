    Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 7th: The Mongolian People's Republic is experiencing favorable livestock growth this year.
    Since the beginning of spring this year, rainfall has been even throughout Mongolia, and the grass is growing exceptionally well. Thanks to the active socialist competition among the Mongolian people and the adoption of advanced Soviet experiences, state-owned farms, herding cooperatives, and individual herders across all provinces have generally fulfilled their 1953 livestock increase plans. For example, Sukhbaatar Province alone increased its livestock by 279,689 heads, completing 132.7 percent of its planned target. The "Labor" and "Bayan-Ulaan" herding cooperatives in Choibalsan Province also fulfilled 106.1 percent of their production plans. Their wool shearing plan was fulfilled at 131.6 percent, and their wool delivery plan to the state was 100 percent fulfilled.
    Currently, all parts of Mongolia are vigorously engaged in grass cutting, hay storage, establishing feeding bases, and taking winter livestock protection measures, preparing to successfully get through the winter and prevent any harm to livestock.

    蒙古人民共和国今年牲畜增殖很多
    【新华社七日讯】乌兰巴托消息：蒙古人民共和国今年的牲畜增殖情况良好。
    今年开春以来，蒙古全国各地雨水均匀，草长得特别好。由于蒙古人民积极展开社会主义竞赛和学习苏联的先进经验，全国各省的国营农牧场、牧民生产合作社和牧民普遍都完成了一九五三年的牲畜增殖计划。例如，仅苏赫—巴托尔省一省就增殖了二十七万九千六百八十九头牲畜，完成了预定计划的百分之一百三十二点七。乔巴山省的“劳动”和“巴彦乌兰”两个牧民生产合作社也都完成了生产计划的百分之一百零六点一，剪集毛绒的计划完成了百分之一百三十一点六，向国家缴纳毛绒的计划也百分之百地完成。
    目前蒙古全国各地正在大力进行刈草、储草、建立饲养基地以及牲畜冬季保暖等工作，准备胜利地渡过冬天，不使牲畜受到损害。
