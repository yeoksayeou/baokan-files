The CCP Central Committee North China Bureau Commends:
A Unit of the North China Military Region Heroically Extinguishes Fire and Rescues National Property

A unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army North China Military Region, with over a thousand personnel, actively and bravely participated in extinguishing a fire at the Handan branch of the China Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company of Hebei Province and rescuing national property. Many cadres and soldiers demonstrated heroic courage and self-sacrifice, creating a shining example of the people's army cherishing national property. The CCP Central Committee North China Bureau recently issued a circular commending the unit's model patriotic action. The leadership of the North China Military Region also sent a telegram to express sympathy to the comrades injured in the fire rescue and to all comrades who participated in the fire rescue, and instructed the unit's leadership to commend and praise those who contributed to the fire fighting and use this example to educate all personnel of the unit, to further strengthen patriotic education and the education of the glorious traditions of our People's Liberation Army.

The North China Bureau's circular pointed out: On June 5, 1953, when a fire broke out in the warehouse of the Handan branch of the China Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company of Hebei Province, over a thousand personnel of a unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army North China Military Region, upon hearing the news, immediately carried fire-fighting equipment and ran to the fire scene to rescue and extinguish the fire. The cadres and soldiers who participated in the fire fighting all demonstrated a high degree of cherishing national property. At the same time, in their eagerness to rescue, they neglected their own safety, resulting in fifty-seven minor injuries and two serious injuries. Chen Guangfu, a correspondent of the unit, fell from a pile of cotton more than one zhang (approximately 3.3 meters) high while rescuing cotton. At that moment, a bale of cotton (each bale weighing about 200 jin - approximately 100 kg) fell on him, twisting his neck and wrist. However, he endured the pain, got up, and carried out more than thirty bales. Comrade Song Guang'en became ill for several months due to overwork in fighting the fire. Comrades Duan Qin, Wang Zhenguo, and Hu Yifang all fell from cotton piles while rescuing, but they all persevered to the end. Comrades Wang Kangxiang and others took off their clothes to wrap soil and extinguish the fire. Deputy Platoon Leader Wang Xiyang stood in the middle of the fire scene, pouring water until his hands were worn out, his feet were blistered, his head was dizzy from the smoke, his eyes could not be opened, and his whole body was burning with pain. Someone advised him to rest, but he insisted. He said, "The more bales we rescue, the less the country will lose." Under his organization, everyone stood in a line, transporting water and soil to rescue the cotton, and he himself rescued fifty-two bales. Comrade Han Tingzao ran so fast that his feet sank into the mud, his shoes were pulled off, and he ran barefoot, resulting in many thorns piercing his feet. However, he ignored his pain and continued to rescue materials. While rescuing cotton, he was hit by a bale of cotton above and fainted. After waking up, he continued to work as before. His clothes were soaked with water, his eyes were filled with tears, and a piece of flesh was torn off his calf, but he still insisted on rescuing until the fire was extinguished. Afterwards, someone asked him if he was tired. He said, "At that time, I only wanted to rescue one more bale of cotton, which would save the country two million yuan, and I didn't think about whether I was tired at all." Soldier Shao Rengui carried cotton and wood, and his shoulders were bleeding from the pressure. Soldier Chang Shanci ran close to the fire, one meter away, to pour water, and advanced step by step, finally jumping onto the cotton pile that still had embers. When he could no longer bear the heat, he poured water on himself to reduce the temperature. Because he was so thirsty, he drank mud several times. Squad Leader He Huaiyi, regardless of his twisted foot, took the water hose and ran to the fire to rescue. His clothes were scorched, his face was red from the heat, and once he suddenly fell into a pile of burnt cotton, and the burning cotton buried his lower body. He remained calm. The worker comrades who were fighting the fire next to him quickly poured water on him. The water flowed from his body, and the heat steamed his head with sweat. He was not rescued until the surrounding fire was extinguished. But he said "It's okay" and rushed back, and ran to the front to rescue. Others, such as Li Junyun, Wang Guowu, Jia Zhong, Li Rong, Liu Ziqing, Gao Fu, Xia Lizhang, Huang Mengliang, Zhao Keyuan, Wang Ming, Yan Zhichen, Lü Macheng, Mao Xizhong, Du Yuhai, Huang Bucheng, Shen Guangyue, Zhang Yinfeng, and cultural instructor Bu Yunsong, all demonstrated a spirit of fearlessness in rescuing national property. It was precisely because the cadres and soldiers of the unit fought so heroically and tenaciously with a high degree of awareness and strict organization that the unit played a decisive role in the rescue work. Because the fire was quickly extinguished, not only were some materials rescued at the fire scene, reducing the loss of national property, but also the yarn factory near the fire scene was spared from the fire.

The circular concluded by pointing out: The local people's government and workers, citizens, and the masses all gave high praise and heartfelt thanks to the heroic actions of the unit in rescuing the fire and protecting the people's property. The CCP Handan Municipal Committee and the Handan Special Commissioner's Office presented a red satin brocade banner. The masses generally reflected: "The comrades of the troops are really brave. When the fire burned to the north, they took the lead and went to the head of the fire. No matter how fierce the fire was, everyone rushed up, and they didn't come down even when their bodies were burning."

    中共中央华北局通报表扬
    华北军区某部英勇扑灭火灾抢救国家物资
    中国人民解放军华北军区某部千余人在积极勇敢地参加扑灭中国花纱布公司河北省邯郸分公司火灾、抢救国家物资的行动中，很多干部、战士表现了英勇果敢与自我牺牲的精神，创造了人民军队爱护国家资财的光辉榜样。中共中央华北局特于最近通报表扬该部的这种爱国主义的模范行动。华北军区领导机关也致电慰问因抢救火灾负伤的同志及抢救火灾的全体同志，并指示该部领导机关对参加救火有功的予以评功、表扬，用这一事例教育该部全体人员，进一步加强爱国主义教育和我人民解放军光荣传统的教育。
    华北局通报指出：一九五三年六月五日，中国花纱布公司河北省邯郸分公司仓库失火时，中国人民解放军华北军区某部千余人，闻讯后即刻携带救火器材，自动跑向火场抢救，将火扑灭。参加救火的干部、战士均表现了高度爱护国家资财的精神，同时因抢救不暇自顾，致有五十七人负轻伤，二人负重伤。该部通讯员陈广福在抢救棉花时，从一丈多高的花堆上摔下，这时上面一包棉花（每包约二百多市斤重）又砸在他身上，扭了脖子和手腕，但他忍着疼痛爬起来，又抬出了三十多包。宋广恩同志因救火过劳，得病数月。段勤、王振国、胡义方等同志，抢救时，都从棉花堆上摔下过，但都坚持到底。王康祥等同志把自己的衣服脱下包土灭火。副排长王锡仰同志，一直站在火场当中泼水，把手磨破了，脚也烫起了泡，烟熏得头昏脑闷，眼睛睁不开，火烤得心乱，全身灼痛。有人劝他休息，他仍然坚持。他说：“多抢救一包，国家即少损失一包。”在他组织下，大家站成行，运水运土来抢救棉花，仅他自己即抢救出五十二包。韩廷藻同志因为跑得过快，双脚陷入泥坑，鞋被拔掉，他就光着脚跑，以致扎了许多刺，但他不顾自己的痛苦，仍继续抢救物资。他在抢救棉花时，被上边的棉花包打着，昏了过去，醒后还是一样干。他的衣服被水湿透，眼睛直流泪，小腿还摔掉一块肉，他仍然坚持抢救到火熄为止。事后有人问他累不累，他说：“当时只想多抢救一包棉花，就替国家抢救二百万元，根本没想到累不累。”战士邵仁贵同志，抬棉花、抬木头，肩膀被压出血。战士常善慈同志，跑近离火一公尺处泼水，而且步步前进，最后跳上了还有余火的棉花堆上。他在烤得实在支持不了的时候，就把水浇在身上，减少热度。因渴的不行，曾经喝了几次泥浆。班长贺怀义，不顾扭伤了的脚，接过水管，跑到火跟前去抢救。衣服烧焦了，脸烤红了，一次突然从烧毁的棉花堆中陷下去，正在燃烧的棉花把他的下身埋住了，他都神色不变。在旁边救火的工人同志赶快把水浇在他身上，水从身上流下，热气蒸得他满头大汗，直到周围的火灭了，才把他救出来。但他说了一声“不要紧”又抢上去，随即昏倒在地。二十分钟后他醒了，一想到国家的财产受损失，他立刻又从救护站赶到火场，并跑到最前边抢救。其他如李俊云、王国武、贾忠、李荣、刘子清、高富、夏立章、黄孟良、赵克元、王明、严植臣、吕马成、毛喜忠、杜玉海、黄步成、申广月、张银风，文化教员卜云松等同志，都为抢救国家财产表现了奋不顾身的精神。正由于该部的干部、战士作了这样有高度觉悟、有严密组织的英勇顽强的斗争，所以该部对这次抢救工作起了决定性的作用。由于烈火被迅速扑灭，不仅在火场抢救出一部物资，减少了国家资财损失，而且使邻近火场的纱厂免遭火灾。
    通报最后指出：当地人民政府和工人、市民群众，对该部抢救火灾保护人民财产的英勇行动，都给以崇高的称赞和衷心的感谢。中共邯郸市委和邯郸专署特赠予红缎锦旗一面。群众普遍反映：“部队同志真勇敢，火往北烧，他们都当先上了火头；不管火势怎样凶猛，大家都扑上去，身上都烤着也不下来。”
