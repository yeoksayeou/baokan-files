    China Red Cross Society Sends a Telegram to the League of Red Cross Societies
    Protesting the US Obstruction of the Work of the Korean-Chinese Red Cross Representatives

    The China Red Cross Society sent a telegram to Mr. Bonabes de Rougé, Secretary-General of the League of Red Cross Societies, protesting the unreasonable obstruction and harm to the Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives by the US military authorities as they provided humanitarian services to prisoners of war:

    Geneva, Secretary-General Bonabes de Rougé of the League of Red Cross Societies:

    The Korean armistice has been achieved, and we warmly welcome the end of the three-year war that caused a great disaster for humanity. In accordance with the spirit of consistently serving the disaster-stricken people, and with the sincere desire to achieve peace in Korea as soon as possible, the Chinese Red Cross Society, in accordance with the Korean Armistice Agreement and the Joint Red Cross Team Working Agreement signed by the warring parties, sent representatives to participate in the work of the Joint Red Cross Team to provide humanitarian services to prisoners of war, together with representatives of the Red Cross Society of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. However, according to reports received by our association, the Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives in the Joint Red Cross Team who are participating in the work of visiting various prisoner-of-war camps under the administration of the US military in South Korea are now being subjected to various unreasonable obstructions and restrictions by the US military authorities, and even the personal safety of the Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives has been attacked by the US military. The main facts are as follows:

    1. The US military authorities endanger the safety of Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives: At 6:45 a.m. on August 9, 1953, the Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives were attacked by tear gas on Geoje Island. On August 13, an American soldier struck Pan Fang, a Chinese Red Cross representative working on the Imjin River Bridge, with a gun, once in the chest and once in the leg. The Joint Red Cross Team Coordination Group appointed Tang Qing, a Korean-Chinese Red Cross representative, and Cruz, a Philippine Red Cross representative, to investigate the incident on August 15, and proved that it was completely true. On August 21, 1953, guards near Geoje Island repeatedly hit Kim Se-gang and Wu Qun of the Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives on the shoulders with rifle butts, twisted the latter's hands behind his back, and pushed him several steps away.

    2. Unreasonable restrictions on visits to prisoner-of-war camps: The Geoje Island prisoner-of-war camp authorities unreasonably stipulated that Joint Red Cross Team groups were not allowed to enter any camp area, and Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives could only watch prisoners of war from 100 meters away from the barbed wire.

    3. Restrictions on visiting prisoner-of-war camp facilities: The Geoje Island prisoner-of-war camp authorities stipulated that visits to dormitories, kitchens, and transportation equipment were not allowed when prisoners of war were present. The Korean-Chinese representatives of the Yeongdeungpo group were simply unable to visit the equipment on the trains transporting prisoners of war.

    4. Restrictions on comforting prisoners of war: The Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives working on the Imjin River Bridge could only talk to prisoners of war through barbed wire. When the Korean-Chinese representatives refused the US military authorities' unreasonable inspection of the Korean-Chinese representatives' words of comfort to the prisoners of war, the US side even cancelled the Korean-Chinese representatives' visit. For the Busan group, the US military authorities restricted the Korean-Chinese representatives from talking to the prisoner-of-war representatives, forced the latter to leave the talking place, unreasonably inspected our representatives' words of comfort to the prisoners of war, and obstructed our representatives' visits. By August 8, 1953, they had been forced to stop working. In Yeongdeungpo, due to the US inspection, the Korean-Chinese representatives were simply unable to give any words of comfort to the prisoners of war during the three days from August 6 to 8, 1953. The same situation occurred on Jeju Island.

    5. Obstruction of the distribution of comfort items and letters of comfort: The Geoje Island prisoner-of-war camp authorities refused to distribute cigarettes and letters of comfort given to prisoners of war by the Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives.

    6. The US military authorities also do not provide due cooperation and convenience on issues such as interpreters and communications.

    The Chinese Red Cross Society believes that the above-mentioned unreasonable obstruction and restriction actions by the US military authorities not only violate the regulations of the Armistice Agreement regarding the Joint Red Cross Team and the clauses of the Joint Red Cross Team Working Agreement, but also seriously damage the universally recognized rights and due respect that the Red Cross should enjoy for humanitarian services. For this reason, we hereby lodge a protest. We urge the League of Red Cross Societies to pay close attention to this issue, and request the League of Red Cross Societies to call on the governments of the countries concerned, as well as the national Red Cross Societies, Red Crescent Societies, Red Lion and Sun Societies, to do everything possible to immediately jointly stop this kind of obstruction that violates the agreement and violates humanitarianism, based on its due moral stance. This is also absolutely necessary in order to implement the basic principles of the Red Cross and in order to realize the主張[zhǔzhāng] claims of the League of Red Cross Societies meetings on striving to achieve peace in Korea.

    中国红十字会致电红十字会协会
    抗议美方阻挠朝中红十字会代表的工作
    【新华社八日讯】中国红十字会向红十字会协会抗议美国军事当局无理阻挠朝中红十字会代表对战俘提供人道服务和伤害朝中红十字会代表电文如下：日内瓦红十字会协会秘书长波纳贝·德鲁日：
    朝鲜停战实现了，我们热烈欢迎这造成人类巨大灾难的三年战争的结束。中国红十字会本其一贯为受灾人们服务的精神和对朝鲜及早实现和平的真诚愿望，按照交战双方已经签订的朝鲜停战协定及联合红十字会小组工作协议，派遣了代表与朝鲜民主主义人民共和国红十字会代表一道参加为战俘提供人道服务的联合红十字会小组的工作。但是，根据本会所得报告，联合红十字会小组中参加前往南朝鲜美军管理下的各战俘营工作的朝中红十字会的代表们，现在却遭受到美方军事当局的种种无理阻挠和限制，甚至朝中红十字会代表的人身亦受到美军的攻击。其主要事实如下：
    一、美方军事当局危害朝中红十字会代表的安全：一九五三年八月九日晨六时四十五分，朝中红十字会代表在巨济岛遭受催泪性毒气的侵袭。八月十三日，美国兵举枪撞击在临津江桥工作的中国红十字会代表潘芳，一次在胸部，一次在腿部。此事已经联合红十字会小组协调组于八月十五日指派朝中红十字会代表唐清与菲律宾红十字会代表克鲁兹前赴出事地点进行调查，证明完全属实。一九五三年八月二十一日又发生了巨济岛附近警卫用步枪枪柄数次打朝中红十字会代表金世刚和吴群肩部，并将后者的双手扭置背后，将他推出数步之远。
    二、无理限制访问战俘营：巨济岛战俘营当局无理的规定联合红十字会小组分组不得进入任何营场，朝中红十字会代表只能在离铁丝网一百公尺以外的地方去观看战俘。
    三、限制参观战俘营设施：巨济岛战俘营当局规定有战俘在场时不准参观宿舍、伙房及运输设备。永登浦分组的朝中代表，根本不可能参观运送战俘的火车上的设备。
    四、限制慰问战俘：在临津江桥工作的朝中红十字会代表，只能隔着铁丝网与战俘谈话。当朝中代表拒绝美方军事当局无理地检查朝中代表对战俘的慰问词后，美方竟然取消了朝中代表的访问。对釜山分组，美方军事当局限制朝中代表与战俘代表谈话，强令后者离开谈话场所，无理的检查我方代表对战俘的慰问词，阻挠我方代表的访问。到一九五三年八月八日，他们已被迫停止工作。在永登浦，由于美方的检查，在一九五三年八月六日到八日的三天中，朝中代表根本不可能对战俘作任何慰问讲话。济州岛亦发生相同情况。
    五、阻挠分发慰问品及慰问信：巨济岛的战俘营当局拒绝分发朝中红十字会代表馈赠战俘的香烟及慰问信。
    六、在译员与通讯等问题上，美方军事当局亦不给予应有的合作与便利。
    中国红十字会认为：美国军事当局上述种种无理阻挠和限制行动，不但破坏了停战协定中有关联合红十字会小组的规定与联合红十字会小组工作协议的条款，同时还严重地损害了众所公认的红十字为人道主义服务所应享有的权利和应得的尊重。为此我们特提出抗议。我们促请红十字会协会对这一问题严加注意，并要求红十字会协会本其应有的道义立场向有关国家的政府，以及各国红十字会、红新月会、红狮会与太阳会呼吁，尽一切力量立即共同制止此种违反协定、违反人道主义的阻挠行为。为了执行红十字的基本原则以及为了实现红十字会协会历次集会关于努力获致朝鲜和平的主张，这也完全是必要的。
    中国红十字会会长  李德全
    一九五三年九月八日于北京
