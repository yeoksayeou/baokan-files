Shanghai, Nanchang, Changsha and other places
Actively Take Measures to Solve the Difficulty of Schooling for Primary School Graduates
    Shanghai: The Shanghai Municipal People's Government has made great efforts to solve the problem of enrollment for primary and junior high school graduates this year. More than 70 percent of primary school graduates have been admitted to junior high school, and 80 percent of junior high school graduates have been admitted to senior high school. It is now continuing to help students who have not been admitted to solve the difficulties of schooling and self-study.
    In the past four years, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government has implemented a policy of opening up to workers and peasants in education, which has led to great development. In the early days of liberation in 1949, there were more than 312,000 primary school students in the city. By 1952, this number had increased to 570,000, an increase of 83 percent in three years. In 1949, there were more than 93,000 middle school students in the city. By 1952, this number had increased to more than 164,000, an increase of 76 percent.
    This year, there is generally not much difficulty for school-age children to enroll in Shanghai, but there is a great difficulty for primary school graduates to enter junior high school. This is due to the limitations of teachers and school buildings, which makes it impossible to establish a large number of middle schools and therefore cannot fully accept primary school graduates into junior high school. This summer, there were a total of 61,563 primary school graduates in the city, and more than 66,000 people applied for the first year of junior high school (including last year's graduates and those who applied for admission with equivalent academic qualifications). The original planned enrollment quota was 30,000, but after expanding the classes, 42,722 people have now been admitted, accounting for nearly 70 percent of this year's primary school graduates. A total of 23,409 junior high school graduates, public and private senior high schools, secondary technical schools and normal schools, admitted a total of 18,741 people, accounting for 80 percent of the number of junior high school graduates. However, there are still some primary and junior high school graduates who cannot be admitted to school. In the process of enrollment, in order to give students more opportunities for admission, the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau divided the city into four examinations: first, secondary technical schools and normal schools; second, public middle schools; third, private middle schools; fourth, supplementary enrollment for private middle schools that did not recruit enough students; finally, private secondary-level cultural supplementary schools further expanded the enrollment quota. Through the above efforts, a large number of primary school graduates have been accepted into junior high school and junior high school graduates into senior high school. However, at present, there are still some primary and junior high school graduates in the city who have not had the opportunity to be admitted to school.
    In order to solve the urgent problems of primary and junior high school graduates who cannot be admitted to school with a responsible attitude, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government has decided to take the following measures: 1. Primary school graduates who graduated early from the spring class this year and who have not been admitted to junior high school this time will be allowed to return to their original schools to study; 2. Any organs, groups, public and private industrial and mining enterprises and industrialists and businessmen who have the conditions to run middle schools may submit plans to the Education Bureau to apply for the establishment of private junior middle schools and private junior middle school-level cultural supplementary schools. 3. The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Shanghai Municipal Democratic Women's Federation and the Shanghai Municipal People's Broadcasting Station are actively preparing to open a "radio lecture" for cultural supplementary education to guide primary school graduates who have not been admitted to school to organize themselves to listen to radio lectures and conduct self-study. For junior high school graduates who have not been admitted to school, it is hoped that all organs and industrial and mining enterprises with the conditions to run technical training classes will recruit junior high school graduates to learn technical work, so that they can become skilled workers after a short period of study, and try their best to meet the wishes of young people to continue their studies.
    Nanchang: The Nanchang Municipal People's Government is actively taking various measures to solve the difficulty of schooling for primary school graduates in a realistic manner.
    This year, there are a total of 3,501 students applying for junior high school in Nanchang City, including 2,744 primary school graduates this year. Originally, 1,720 people were planned to be admitted. Among the 1,781 people who were not admitted, there were 1,182 primary school graduates this year, of which 300 were over 16 years old, and the rest were mostly under 14 years old. They are young and physically weak, and it is difficult to find employment according to the situation in Nanchang City. Parents have responded one after another, urgently requesting that they be able to continue their studies. In order to meet the growing educational demands of the broad masses of people as much as possible, the Nanchang Municipal People's Government has formulated several specific measures: First, increase the number of classes in each middle school to expand the enrollment quota for junior high schools. The biggest problem now is the lack of teachers and school buildings. The Nanchang Municipal People's Government is looking for houses suitable for running schools, and is also preparing to transfer some teachers from primary schools. If the school buildings really cannot accommodate them, then run a two-shift system. For a small number of primary school graduates with poor grades, the Nanchang Municipal People's Government has decided that, on the principle of voluntariness and without affecting primary school teaching, they can return to the sixth grade of primary school to continue their studies, or open night school tutoring classes to improve their academic performance. It is estimated that after taking the above measures, the enrollment problems of most primary school graduates in Nanchang City can be solved.
    Although the Nanchang Municipal People's Government has made its best efforts to solve the enrollment problem of primary school graduates this time, it still cannot solve it completely, and a part of primary school students will inevitably participate in various labor production. For this problem, the Nanchang Municipal People's Government is also actively thinking of ways to help solve it.
    Changsha: The Changsha Municipal People's Government is currently making its best efforts to actively eliminate various difficulties and take measures such as appropriately expanding the quota for new classes and running a two-shift system to further solve the schooling problem of senior primary school graduates in Changsha City.
    Since the liberation of Changsha City four years ago, both middle schools and primary schools have made great progress. In the second semester of 1953, there will be 40,537 primary school students in school, an increase of 81 percent compared to 22,398 in 1949. In 1953, there will be 15,419 middle school students in school, an increase of nearly 80 percent compared to 8,579 in 1949.
    However, since liberation, the demand for cultural learning among children of all strata of the people has greatly increased. Not only do primary school graduates generally demand to continue their studies, but also primary school students who had dropped out of school have also demanded to enter middle school with equivalent academic qualifications. In addition, senior primary school graduates from neighboring counties of Changsha have come to Changsha schools to apply for admission, so that the 19 middle schools in the city have a total of 16,068 applicants this year, which greatly exceeds the current school capacity.
    According to this year's enrollment plan: The 19 schools in Changsha City will enroll a total of 3,450 students, and 12,618 students have not been admitted. Among them, students from Changsha City account for a considerable proportion. After careful research, the Changsha Municipal People's Government has decided to make its best efforts to solve the problems that can be solved. The current decision is to: 1. Add a part of students in each middle school in the city under the possible conditions by using the "two-shift system"; 2. Appropriately expand the number of students in each new senior high school class in order to reduce the number of new senior high school classes, free up teachers and equipment, and increase the enrollment of new junior high school students; 3. Appropriately expand the quota for each new junior high school class; 4. Junior high school graduates who graduate early and have not been admitted to senior high school will still enter the first semester of the third year of junior high school to continue their studies.

    上海、南昌、长沙等地
    采取积极措施解决小学毕业生就学困难
    上海：上海市人民政府在解决今年小学和初中毕业生的升学问题中，曾作了很大的努力，有百分之七十以上的小学毕业生已升入初中，有百分之八十的初中毕业生已升入高中，现正继续帮助未升学的学生解决就学及自学的困难。
    上海市人民政府过去四年来在教育事业上执行了向工农开门的政策，因而有了很大的发展。一九四九年解放初期，全市小学生共三十一万二千多人，到一九五二年增加到五十七万人，三年中增加了百分之八十三。一九四九年全市中学生共九万三千多人，到一九五二年增加到十六万四千多人，增加了百分之七十六。
    今年上海学龄儿童入学，一般没有多大困难，小学毕业生升初中就有很大困难。这是由于师资和校舍的限制，不可能大量兴办中学，因而不能完全接受小学毕业生进入初中。今年暑期，全市小学毕业生共计六万一千五百六十三人，投考初中一年级的共达六万六千多人（包括去年毕业生及同等学力报名投考者在内），原定招生名额三万人，经过扩大班级，现已录取四万二千七百二十二人，录取名额占今年小学毕业生名额近百分之七十。初中毕业生共计二万三千四百零九人，公、私立高中、中等技术学校和师范学校，共录取一万八千七百四十一人，占初中毕业生名额百分之八十。但还有一部分小学毕业生和初中毕业生不能升学。在招生过程中，上海市教育局为了使学生有较多的录取机会，所以全市分四次考试：第一次，中等技术学校与师范学校；第二次，公立中学；第三次，私立中学；第四次，私立中学未取足名额的补充招考；最后，私立中等程度文化补习学校再扩充名额招考。经过上述的努力，已大量接受小学毕业生入初中，初中毕业生进高中。但目前全市还有一部分小学和初中毕业生没有得到升学的机会。
    上海市人民政府为了以负责的态度，解决目前不能升学的小学毕业生和初中毕业生迫切需要解决的问题，决定采取以下措施：一、今年春季班提前毕业的小学毕业生，这次没有考取初中的，允许他们仍回原校学习；二、凡有条件办中学的机关、团体、公私工矿企业及工商业家，可以拟具计划向教育局申请设立私立初级中学及私立初中程度文化补习学校。三、上海市教育局、青年团上海市委员会、上海市民主妇联与上海市人民广播电台积极筹备开办文化补习的“广播讲座”，指导未升学小学毕业生组织起来收听广播讲座，进行自学。对未升学的初中毕业生，希望各机关及工矿有条件举办技术训练班者，招收初中毕业生学习技工，使他们经过短期学习能成为技术工人，尽可能做到满足青年继续求学的愿望。
    南昌：南昌市人民政府，正积极采取各种措施，实事求是地解决小学毕业生的就学困难。
    今年南昌市投考初中的学生共有三千五百零一人，其中有本届小学毕业生二千七百四十四人，原来准备录取一千七百二十人，在没有被录取的一千七百八十一人中，本届小学毕业生有一千一百八十二人，其中三百人在十六岁以上，其余大部分在十四岁以下，年龄小，体力弱，根据南昌市的情况，就业有困难。家长们纷纷反映迫切要求能继续升学。南昌市人民政府为了尽一切可能更多地满足广大人民群众在教育方面日益增长的要求，已拟出了几项具体的办法：首先是在各中学增加班次，扩大初中的招生名额。现在最大的问题是师资不够和校舍缺乏。南昌市人民政府已在寻找适合办学校的房屋，同时准备在小学中抽调一部分教师。假如校舍实在容纳不下，就办二部制。对少数成绩太差的小学毕业生，南昌市人民政府决定在自愿的原则下，在不影响小学教学的情况下，可以回到小学六年级继续学习，或者开办夜校补习班，来提高他们的学习成绩。估计采取以上这些办法以后，南昌市大部分小学毕业生的升学问题，都能够得到解决。
    这次南昌市人民政府虽然尽了最大的努力来解决小学毕业生的升学问题，但是还是不能全部解决，必然要有一部分小学生参加各种劳动生产。对于这个问题，南昌市人民政府也正在积极想办法帮助解决。
    长沙：长沙市人民政府，目前正以最大的努力，积极排除各种困难，采取适当扩大新班名额，并举办二部制等办法，来进一步解决长沙市高小毕业生的就学问题。
    长沙市解放四年以来，无论中学、小学，都有了很大的发展。一九五三年下期在校小学生，将为四万零五百三十七人，比一九四九年的二万二千三百九十八人，增加了百分之八十一。一九五三年在校中学生将达一万五千四百一十九人，比一九四九年的八千五百七十九人，增加了将近百分之八十。
    但是，解放后，各阶层人民子女要求学习文化的大大增加，不仅一般小学毕业生普遍要求升学，而且原已失学的小学生也纷纷要求以同等学力来升入中学。加以邻近长沙各县的高小毕业学生纷纷前来长沙各校投考，以致全市十九所中学本届投考学生达一万六千零六十八人，大大超过了目前学校的收容量。
    根据本届招生计划：长沙市十九校共录取学生三千四百五十人，尚有一万二千六百十八人未能录取。其中长沙市学生，占相当大的比例。长沙市人民政府经过缜密的研究，决定尽最大努力来解决可能解决的问题。目前决定的办法是：一、在本市各个中学的可能条件下，用“二部制”的办法加收一部分学生；二、高中新班每班人数略予扩充，以便减少高中新生的班次，腾出教师、设备，增收初中新生；三、初中新生每班名额略予扩充；四、初中提前毕业生未考取高中的，仍入初中三年一期继续求学。
