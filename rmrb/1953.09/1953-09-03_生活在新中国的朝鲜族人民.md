Editor's Note: September 3rd marks the first anniversary of the establishment of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Region in Jilin Province. Since liberation, and especially since the implementation of regional autonomy, the Korean people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, have undergone tremendous changes and leaps in all aspects of political, economic, and cultural life, just like all other ethnic groups in the country. The purpose of publishing this article now is to introduce the living conditions of the Korean people in our country.

The Korean ethnic group is one of the minority ethnic groups in China, distributed in the northeastern provinces and cities of Jilin, Songjiang, Liaodong, Liaoxi, Heilongjiang, Rehe, Shenyang, Fushun, Anshan, Lushun-Dalian, Benxi, etc., as well as the eastern region of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, totaling approximately 1.1 million people. The Korean people are mainly engaged in agriculture, cultivating paddy fields. Like the people of other ethnic groups in Northeast China, the Korean people have long suffered from the oppression and devastation of Japanese imperialism and feudal forces. Japanese imperialism attempted to use "assimilation" to eliminate the Korean ethnic group, prohibiting the use of Korean language in all educational and cultural institutions and implementing the Japanese education system. Under this cruel oppression, the Korean people had no food or clothing, suffered countless disasters, and lived in deep misery. The Korean people, with their rich revolutionary tradition, bravely participated in the struggle against Japanese imperialism and for national survival alongside all ethnic groups in China during the Anti-Japanese War. In this struggle, tens of thousands of Korean martyrs shed their blood for the revolution. During the Chinese People's Liberation War, the Korean people also sent their outstanding sons and daughters to join the People's Liberation Army, fighting from Northeast China to Hainan. Yanbian, where the Korean ethnic group is concentrated, as well as parts of Liaodong and Songjiang provinces, were consolidated revolutionary base areas during the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War. In the revolutionary struggle against imperialism and feudal forces, the Korean people have formed an inseparable relationship with the people of all ethnic groups in the country.

The victory of the "September 3rd" Anti-Japanese War ended the suffering history of the Korean people. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, land reform was completed in most of the areas inhabited by the Korean people as early as 1947, and democratic regimes were established. In 1949, the system of people's representative conferences was established. After the promulgation of the Outline of the People's Republic of China on Ethnic Regional Autonomy, twelve ethnic autonomous regions at various levels were established successively in areas with a concentration of Korean population, the larger of which is the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Region (prefecture level) in Jilin Province. The autonomous organs of these ethnic autonomous regions fully embody the rights of the main ethnic group in autonomy to manage its own ethnic affairs and be masters of its own affairs. Taking the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Region in Jilin Province (hereinafter referred to as the Yanbian Autonomous Region) as an example: there are a total of 20,196 representatives to the people's representative conferences at all levels in the region, of which 16,523 are Korean representatives, accounting for nearly 82% of the total number of representatives; there are a total of 1,377 cadres in the people's governments at all levels, of which 1,004 are Korean cadres, accounting for nearly 73% of the total number of cadres. The backbone of the people's governments at all levels are mainly Korean cadres. Thirty-two ethnic democratic united governments have been established in areas where multiple ethnic groups live together, including seven at the county level. In the people's representative conferences and government organs, there are ethnic representatives and cadres in proportion to the population, ensuring the equal rights of all ethnic groups in the organs of power. Minority ethnic components scattered in other areas also enjoy equal ethnic rights, with the right to vote and to be elected. After the promulgation of the Electoral Law of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China and local people's congresses at all levels, the areas inhabited by the Korean people are actively carrying out universal suffrage.

After several years of recovery and development, the economic construction of the Korean people has undergone major changes. The industrial production of the Yanbian Autonomous Region has exceeded the highest level of 1943, and the total output value of state-owned and local state-owned enterprises accounts for a considerable proportion of the national economy. In addition to state-owned industrial and mining enterprises, local industries such as rubber, papermaking, knitting, agricultural tools, and timber have also developed considerably. The impoverished Korean farmers who had no land or little land participated in land reform under the leadership of the People's Government after liberation, and were allocated the same means of production and means of livelihood. After several years of effort, the cultivated area has generally increased, the output has greatly increased, and the means of production have also increased. The paddy field area in the Yanbian Autonomous Region has expanded to 159% of the original area in 1943. The unit area yield of agricultural production in the autonomous region in 1952 increased by 150% compared to 1943, and grain is now more than sufficient. The average output per household of Korean farmers in Liaodong Province has increased by 160% compared to 1943. Korean farmers in Songjiang Province have an average of one ox per 2.1 households and one ox cart per 2.6 households. In Da Wushegou Village, Dongning County, Songjiang Province, there are 355 Korean farmer households. In 1947, there were only nine oxen, but in 1952, the number increased to 325. There have also been many improvements in production tools. Small-scale improved agricultural tools are used in paddy fields, and animal-drawn agricultural tools are used in some dry fields. With the development of production, people's lives have improved significantly. About 70% of rural households have risen to the level of middle peasants. Many rural areas have installed water pumps and electric lights, and purchased sewing machines, etc. The mutual aid and cooperation movement in rural areas has developed considerably, with 85% of farmers already organized. In Hailin, Ning'an, and other counties in Songjiang Province, more than 95% of the total number of farmers have joined agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups. Xinghuo Collective Farm in Huachuan County, Songjiang Province, the first collective farm in New China, has emerged in the rural areas where the Korean ethnic group is concentrated, and the Yanbian Autonomous Region has also seen the emergence of Liming Collective Farm and 237 agricultural production cooperatives. Trade cooperation has developed universally, and supply and marketing cooperatives have been organized in rural areas, with participation accounting for 65% of the total population. Supply and marketing cooperatives have become the main commercial network in rural areas and a link of urban-rural mutual assistance. The Yanbian Autonomous Region now has one district cooperative, six county (city) cooperatives, and 286 grassroots cooperatives.

In recent years, with the development and needs of economic undertakings, the cultural and educational undertakings of the Korean ethnic group in Northeast China have also developed greatly. Ethnic languages are used for teaching in schools at all levels, and various publications are published in ethnic languages. Primary education has now reached the level of universal education, with an enrollment rate of 95% for school-age children, and 100% in some areas. There are a total of 1,297 primary schools with 217,200 students, averaging one primary school per concentrated village and one primary school student for every five people; in Heilongjiang Province, there is an average of one primary school student for every four people. There are currently 58 secondary schools, including nine high schools, with 34,738 students, an increase of 33,893 from before the "September 3rd" liberation. In the Yanbian Autonomous Region, there is now an average of one secondary school for every two districts and one secondary school student for every 35 people. The Yanbian Autonomous Region established the Yanbian University after liberation, with 1,134 students, and also has one political cadre school, two language colleges, and one midwifery school. Social education has also developed considerably. Part-time schools for workers, farmers, etc. have been established in factories, mines, rural areas, and streets. There are 1,589 in the Yanbian Autonomous Region, with more than 70,000 students. Korean-populated villages in Songjiang, Liaodong, and other provinces have an average of two to three farmer part-time schools per village, with more than 90% of farmers aged 15 to 45 participating in learning. Nursery schools during busy farming seasons have also been organized more generally, with 406 in the Yanbian Autonomous Region, averaging one per village. Various cultural institutions have also been established. The Yanbian Autonomous Region has a Federation of Literary and Art Circles, a radio station, a cultural troupe, nine cinemas, seven cultural centers, seven libraries, 23 amateur theater troupes, and 82 rural clubs. The Yanbian Education Publishing House has published more than 500 kinds of books in Korean, with more than 12 million copies, in recent years. The Northeast Korean People's Daily has a daily circulation of more than 36,000 copies. In the rural areas of the Yanbian Autonomous Region, there is an average of one newspaper for every three households, and in Songjiang Province, there is an average of one newspaper for every four households. Cultural and recreational activities and sports activities are very common. Beautiful ethnic songs and dances praise the great leader Chairman Mao and the happy life after liberation everywhere. Medical and health undertakings have also gradually developed and improved. The Yanbian Autonomous Region has one district hospital, nine county (city) hospitals, 89 district and village health centers, 62 maternal and child health stations, and 157 midwifery stations; counties with more Korean population in Songjiang Province have established eight health centers, and cities have ethnic health centers. Environmental sanitation has also been improved, and general infectious diseases have been greatly reduced.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Korean people, who have undergone a long period of revolutionary struggle, have established a close brotherly friendship with the Han people and the people of all ethnic groups. In social reform, production construction, cultural exchange, and daily life, this loving relationship has grown and consolidated, and they have become increasingly harmonious and united. Under the shining light of Chairman Mao's ethnic policy, in a big family of cooperation, friendship, mutual assistance, and unity, the Korean people, like all ethnic groups in the country, will achieve greater development in all aspects of politics, economy, and culture.

    生活在新中国的朝鲜族人民
    黄光学
    编者按：九月三日为吉林省延边朝鲜族自治区成立一周年纪念日。解放以来，特别是实行区域自治以来，朝鲜族人民在中国共产党和人民政府领导下，和全国各民族一样，在政治、经济、文化生活各个方面，都起了巨大变化，有了飞跃的发展。现在发表此文，目的在于介绍我国的朝鲜族人民的生活状况。
    朝鲜族是我国少数民族之一，分布在东北吉林、松江、辽东、辽西、黑龙江、热河、沈阳、抚顺、鞍山、旅大、本溪等省市以及内蒙古自治区东部区，共约一百一十余万人。朝鲜族人民主要从事农业，耕种稻田。朝鲜族人民和东北各族人民一样，在历史上曾经长期遭受日本帝国主义和封建势力的压迫与蹂躏。日本帝国主义曾企图使用“同化”手段消灭朝鲜民族，在一切教育机关和文化机关禁止使用朝鲜语文，实行日本的教育制度。在这种残酷的压迫下，朝鲜族人民衣食无着，灾难重重，生活在水深火热之中。富有革命传统的朝鲜族人民，在抗日战争期间，和中国各少数民族一起，英勇地参加了抗击日本帝国主义，争取民族生存的斗争。在斗争中，数以万计的朝鲜族烈士为革命流尽了鲜血。在中国人民解放战争时期，朝鲜族人民同样派出了自己的优秀儿女参加了人民解放军，从东北打到海南。朝鲜民族聚居的延边及辽东、松江等省部分地区，在抗日战争和解放战争时期，都是巩固的革命根据地。在反对帝国主义和封建势力的革命斗争中，朝鲜族人民和全国各民族人民结成了血肉不可分离的关系。
    “九·三”抗日战争的胜利结束了朝鲜族人民苦难的历史。在共产党的领导下，朝鲜族人民居住地区大部分在一九四七年即完成了土地改革，建立了民主政权。一九四九年更开始建立了人民代表会议制度。中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要颁布后，朝鲜族聚居地区先后建立了各级民族自治区十二个，其中较大的有吉林省延边朝鲜族自治区
    （专区级）。这些民族自治区的自治机关都充分体现了自治的主体民族在管理本民族事务上当家作主的权利。以吉林省延边朝鲜族自治区（以下简称为延边自治区）为例：全区各级人民代表会议代表共二万零一百九十六名，其中朝鲜族代表一万六千五百二十三名，占代表总数的百分之八十二弱；各级人民政府的干部共一千三百七十七名，其中朝鲜族干部有一千零四名，占干部总数的百分之七十三弱。各级人民政府的骨干主要是朝鲜族干部。在民族杂居区已建立三十二个民族民主联合政府，其中包括县级七个。在人民代表会议与政府机关中，都有与人口比例相适应的民族代表和干部，保障了各民族在政权机关中的平等权利。散居的少数民族成份，也同样享有民族平等权利，有选举权和被选举权。中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会选举法颁布以后，朝鲜族居住地区正积极地进行普选工作。
    经过数年来的恢复和发展，朝鲜族人民的经济建设事业发生了重大的变化。延边自治区工业生产已经超过一九四三年的最高水平，国营和地方国营企业生产总值在国民经济中占了相当大的比重。该区除国营工矿企业外，地方工业如橡胶、造纸、针织、农具、木材等也有相当发展。无地和少地的贫困的朝鲜族农民，解放后在人民政府领导下，和其他各民族人民共同参加了土地改革，分得了同样的生产资料与生活资料。经过几年的努力，耕地面积普遍增大，产量大大提高，生产资料也有增多。延边自治区水田耕地面积扩大到一九四三年原有面积的百分之一百五十九。该自治区一九五二年农业生产单位面积产量比一九四三年增加到百分之一百五十，现在粮食已经从不足到有余。辽东省朝鲜族农民平均每户产量比一九四三年增加百分之一百六十。松江省朝鲜族农民平均每二点一户有一头耕牛，二点六户有一辆牛车。该省东宁县大乌蛇沟村有朝鲜族农民三百五十五户，一九四七年只有九头牛，一九五二年则增加到三百二十五头。生产工具也有很多改进，稻田都使用小型的改良农具，部分旱田使用马拉农具。随着生产的发展，人民的生活有了显著的提高。农村中百分之七十左右农户已上升为中农生活水平。好多农村都安装了抽水机、电灯，购买缝纫机等。在农村中互助合作运动有相当的发展，百分之八十五的农民已经组织起来。松江省海林、宁安等县，参加农业生产合作社及互助组的占农民总数的百分之九十五以上。朝鲜族聚居的农村中已出现了新中国第一个集体农庄——松江省桦川县星火集体农庄，延边自治区也出现了黎明集体农庄与二百三十七个农业生产合作社。贸易合作事业普遍发展起来，农村中都组织了供销合作社，参加人数占人口总数的百分之六十五。供销合作社已成为农村中主要的商业网，城乡互助的纽带。延边自治区现在已有一个区社，六个县（市）社，二百八十六个基层社。
    几年来，随着经济事业的发展和需要，东北朝鲜民族的文化教育事业也有极大的发展。各级学校都使用民族语文教学，各种刊物用民族语文出版。小学教育目前已达到普及教育程度，学龄儿童就学率为百分之九十五，部分地区达到百分之百。小学共有一千二百九十七所，学生二十一万七千二百人，平均每个聚居村有一所小学，每五名人口中有一个小学生；黑龙江省平均四人中有一名小学生。中学现有五十八所，其中高中九所，学生三万四千七百三十八名，较“九·三”解放前增加三万三千八百九十三名。延边自治区现在平均两个区有一所中学，三十五个人中有中学生一名。延边自治区解放后建立了高等学校——延边大学，现有学生一千一百三十四名，另外设有政治干部学校一处、语文专修学校两处、助产学校一处。社会教育也有相当发展。在工矿、农村、街道普遍设有工人、农民等业余学校，延边自治区有一千五百八十九所，学员七万多，松江、辽东等省朝鲜族聚居村每村平均有农民业余学校二至三所，十五至四十五岁的农民百分之九十以上参加了学习。农忙托儿所也较普遍组织起来，延边自治区有四百零六处，平均每村一处。各种文化机构也已建立。延边自治区设有文联、广播电台、文工团以及电影院九处、文化馆七处、图书馆七处、业余剧团二十三个、农村俱乐部八十二个。延边教育出版社几年来出版朝鲜语文各种书籍五百余种，一千二百余万册。东北朝鲜人民报每日发行三万六千余份，延边自治区农村中平均每三户有一份报纸，松江省平均四户有一份报纸。文化娱乐活动、体育活动十分普遍，优美的民族歌舞到处歌颂伟大的领袖毛主席，歌颂翻身后的幸福生活。医疗卫生事业也逐渐发展与改善。延边自治区设有区医院一处、县（市）立医院九处、区村卫生所八十九处，妇幼保健站六十二处，接生站一百五十七处；松江省朝鲜族较多的县份已设立八处卫生所，城市设有民族卫生所。环境卫生也得到改善，一般传染病大为减少。
    在共产党领导下，经过长期革命斗争的朝鲜族人民，和汉族人民及各族人民建立了亲密的兄弟般的友谊，在社会改革、生产建设、文化交流与日常生活中，这种友爱的关系更加增长和巩固，日益亲睦团结。在毛主席民族政策的光辉照耀下，在合作友爱互助团结的大家庭里，朝鲜族人民将和国内各民族一样，在政治、经济、文化各个方面得到更大的发展。
