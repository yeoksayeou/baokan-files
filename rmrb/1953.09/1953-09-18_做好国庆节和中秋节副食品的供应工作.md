    Do a Good Job in Supplying Non-Staple Foods for National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival
    National Day and the Mid-Autumn Festival are approaching. This year, due to the development of national economic construction, the increase in the population of cities and industrial and mining areas, and the continuous improvement of people's purchasing power, the demand for non-staple foods in various places during these two festivals will inevitably increase significantly. Appropriately meeting this need of the people is a major task for the current market supply work.
    In order to do a good job in the supply of non-staple foods, state-owned commercial departments should strengthen their leadership and preparation for this work. Since National Day and the Mid-Autumn Festival are very close, the supply time is very concentrated, so it is necessary to consider them as a whole. Fully open up sources of goods, and organize the forces of cooperatives and private commerce to meet market needs in a prepared and planned manner under the leadership of the state-owned economy. At the same time, it is necessary to strictly control commodity prices, taking into account the interests of producers, transporters, and consumers, so as to ensure an ample supply of goods without increasing the burden on consumers.
    Local industrial and commercial administrative departments should, under the unified supply plan of the local area, appropriately assist in solving the difficulties of private merchants in procurement, and provide reasonable and necessary assistance in transportation. At the same time, it is necessary to strictly prevent speculative private merchants from rushing to purchase and raise prices and monopolistic activities, in order to ensure the stability of non-staple food prices during the festival.
    In the work of organizing the supply of non-staple foods, organizing transportation capacity is a very important link. State-owned commercial and industrial and commercial administrative departments should take the initiative to contact transportation departments, provide plans for the materials to be transported; transportation departments should also vigorously assist this work to strengthen the transfer work between cities and villages, and between cities and cities, to ensure the smooth flow of festival materials.
    Local financial and economic committees must strengthen their leadership in this work, and when necessary, should organize relevant departments to form temporary inspection teams based on the specific conditions of each place, to specifically supervise and inspect, to ensure the victorious completion of the supply of festival goods.

    做好国庆节和中秋节副食品的供应工作
    国庆节与中秋节即将到来。今年，由于国家经济建设的开展，城市、工矿区人口的增多和人民购买力的不断提高，在这两个节日中，各地对副食品的需要量必然有很大增加。适当满足人民的这种需要，就是目前市场供应工作的重大任务。
    为了作好副食品的供应，国营商业部门应该加强对这一工作的领导与准备。由于国庆节与中秋节相距很近，供应的时间很集中，因此必须统筹考虑。充分开辟货源，并组织合作社与私营商业的力量，在国营经济领导下，有准备有计划地满足市场的需要。同时要严密地掌握商品的价格，照顾产、运、消三者的利益，既要作到保证充裕的货源，又不致加重消费者的负担。
    各地工商行政部门，应该在当地统一的供应计划下，适当地协助解决私商在采购上的困难，在交通运输上给予合理的和必要的协助。但同时必须严防投机私商抢购抬价与垄断的活动，以保证节日副食品价格的稳定。
    在组织副食品供应的工作中，组织运输力量是一个很重要的环节。国营商业与工商行政部门应主动地与交通运输部门取得联系，提供需要运输物资的计划；交通运输部门亦应大力协助这一工作，以加强城市和乡村、城市和城市之间的调运工作，以保证节日物资流畅。
    各地财政经济委员会必须对这一工作加强领导，必要时应根据各地具体情况，组织有关部门成立临时检查组，专门督促检查，以保证胜利地完成节日商品的供应工作。
