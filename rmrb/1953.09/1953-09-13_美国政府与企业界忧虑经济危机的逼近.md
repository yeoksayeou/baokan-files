Xinhua News Agency report from Washington: The US government and business circles are generally worried about the approaching economic crisis in the United States.

    First, the Eisenhower government. Even before the end of the Korean War, US Treasury Secretary Humphrey was already worried that American businesses would face a "necessary adjustment" after the war. The facts of the past month or so have shown that the US economy is already entering this so-called "adjustment" process. The recession in some economic sectors continues to develop, while the recession in other sectors is forming. According to official materials, in the eight months ending September 1, agricultural income fell another 6% compared with the same period last year. The industrial production index for July and August was significantly lower than the level of the second quarter of this year. Manufacturers' orders continue to decrease, while unsold industrial and agricultural products continue to increase... "U.S. News & World Report" magazine said that US officials admit that these aspects are the biggest "weaknesses" in the US economy. Some officials have privately expressed concern that total industrial production will fall by 5% to 8% within a year, and if the decline is more drastic, it will lead to a "serious depression."

    To this end, the Eisenhower government is currently taking measures to try to avoid a repeat of the Great Depression of the 1930s. According to the Associated Press, as a first step, the Eisenhower government is establishing a nationwide "economic scout network" composed of entrepreneurs, bankers, politicians, and upper-level labor leaders. The task of this scout network is to report "the first signs of an economic depression" at any time.

    The non-seasonal sluggishness of the New York stock market also reflects the lack of confidence of business people in the future. Since the end of the Korean War, there has been a notable change in the Wall Street stock market. The "summer rally" that usually occurred in the past many years did not appear this year. On the contrary, as of September 5, the price of the New York stock market had fallen for four consecutive weeks. On August 31, industrial stocks fell slightly to their lowest record this year. An Associated Press report on the 6th, in analyzing the reasons for the sluggish stock market, pointed out: The decline in stock prices is "the stock market's adjustment to the expected recession in the overall activities of national enterprises that will appear within this year and early next year." A United Press International report on the 5th said, "Wall Street has become increasingly deserted recently due to the inevitable talk of corporate recession. Conservative experts agree that corporate adjustments are possible. It is pointed out that, in fact, adjustments are already underway in some sectors."

    In the American bourgeois press, the pessimistic tone about the future of enterprises is increasing, and it is being expressed with certainty. The September 4th issue of "U.S. News & World Report" magazine quoted the results of a survey by the National Association of Purchasing Management, saying that business activity "may be increasingly disappointing this fall... Production plans are being cut by 22%. Various signs indicate that in the coming months, automobile production will be relatively small, and steel demand in the fourth quarter of this year will decrease." The August 27th "Commercial and Financial Chronicle" published two articles predicting the arrival of an economic crisis. One of them, an article written by Ludick, editor of the "Journal of Commerce", said that the US economy has two prospects in the future: "1. A mild recession caused by excessive inventory, like the one in 1948-49, which would reduce industrial productivity by about 10% within a year... 2. A more serious recession like the one in 1937-38. Due to the imbalance between production and consumption, this recession caused serious unemployment and caused industrial production to decline by about 30% within a year." Another article written by Gann was even more serious. Based on his research on the so-called "cycle law" of industry and commerce, he predicted that "the situation will be the same as in 1929." He refuted the claim by some people that the government could take measures such as expanding public works expenditures to avoid the crisis, and wrote: "The coming years will prove that the prosperity of the war economy, the government's support for agricultural product prices, and the increase in surplus products do not constitute true prosperity, but will only lead to deflation and depression."

### 美国政府与企业界忧虑经济危机的逼近

    美国政府与企业界忧虑经济危机的逼近
    据新华社讯：华盛顿消息，美国政府与企业界人士对逼近中的美国经济危机普遍感到忧虑。
    首先是艾森豪威尔政府。在朝鲜战争还没有结束以前，美国财政部长汉弗莱就已经在担心，战争结束后美国企业将会出现一次“必要的调整”。这一个多月来的事实说明，美国经济已经在进入这所谓“调整”过程，一些经济部门的衰退在继续发展，另一些部门的衰退在形成中。根据官方公布的材料，到九月一日为止的八个月内，农业的收入比去年同期又下降了百分之六。七八两月份的工业生产指数大大低于今年第二季的水平。制造商的订货单继续减少，而卖不出去的工农业产品却不断增加……“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志说，美国官方人士承认这几方面是美国经济中最大的“弱点”。一些官员们已经私下表示担忧，工业总生产在一年内将会下降百分之五至百分之八，如果下降得较为激烈，还会导致一次“严重的萧条”。
    为此，艾森豪威尔政府目前正在采取措施，力图避免三十年代经济大恐慌的局面重演。据美联社的消息说，作为第一个步骤，艾森豪威尔政府正在建立一个由企业家、银行家、政客及劳工上层分子组成的全国范围的“经济探察员网”。这个探察网的任务是随时汇报“经济萧条到来的最初的一些迹象”。
    纽约股票市场的非季节性的平疲现象也反映了企业人士对前景缺乏信心。朝鲜战争结束以来，华尔街的股票市场发生了一个值得注意的变化。在过去许多年内通常出现的“夏季旺市”，今年没有出现。相反，到九月五日为止，纽约股票市场的价格已连续下降了四个星期。在八月三十一日，工业股票曾略跌至今年以来的最低纪录。美联社六日消息在分析股票市场不景气的原因时指出：股票价格下跌是“股票市场适应预料将在今年内及明年初出现的全国企业整个活动衰退的调整”。合众社五日的消息说，“由于企业衰退不可避免的谈论，华尔街最近已变得愈来愈清淡。保守的专家们一致同意，企业调整是可能的。据指出，事实上，调整在某些部门已在进行中。”
    美国资产阶级报刊上，对企业前途表示悲观的论调愈来愈多，而且带着肯定的口气。九月四日出版的“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志引全国购买商协会的调查结果说，企业活动“在今年秋季可能是愈来愈令人失望的……生产计划正在减缩百分之二十二。各种迹象显示：在以后几个月内，汽车生产将会比较小，在今年第四季的钢铁需求将会减少。”八月二十七日“商业金融纪事报”刊载了两篇预测经济危机到来的文章。其中一篇由“商务日报”编辑鲁狄克写的文章说：美国经济今后有两种前景：“一、一九四八—四九年式的因存货过多而造成的温和的衰退，这次衰退约使工业生产率在一年内削减百分之十……。二、一九三七—三八年式比较严重的衰退，由于生产与消费的失调，这次衰退引起了严重的失业，并使工业生产在约一年之内下降百分之三十。”另一篇由甘恩写的文章说得更加严重。他根据他对工商业所谓“循环规律”的研究，预言“情况将和一九二九年一样”。他驳斥了某些人所宣传的政府可以采取扩大公共工程开支等办法来避免危机的说法，并写道：“今后几年将证实，战争经济的繁荣，政府给予农产品价格的支持及剩余产品的增加，都不会构成真正的繁荣，而只会导致通货紧缩与萧条。”
