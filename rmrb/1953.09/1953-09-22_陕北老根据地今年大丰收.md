The autumn crops in the old revolutionary base area of northern Shaanxi are almost completely ripe. In the plains and on the mountains, the fields are covered with the heavy ears of sorghum and millet. Since the beginning of spring this year, the crops in northern Shaanxi have not lacked rainfall. In addition, the People's Government has been building water conservancy projects for the farmers in the old revolutionary base area of northern Shaanxi, leading farmers to build water cellars and earth dams, and carrying out soil and water conservation work, so that the rural areas of the old revolutionary base area of northern Shaanxi have seen the first good year in more than ten years. According to the current situation, the mountain slopes, which in the past could only yield five or six dou or three or four dou of grain per hectare (three mu), are estimated to yield an average of seven or eight dou this year; the plains, which in the past yielded a little more than one dan of grain per hectare, are estimated to yield more than two dan this year. On that field covered with dense crops, the huge ears bent the tall sorghum stalks, and the autumn wind blowing from the field could hardly move them. In the Fengchan field of an agricultural production cooperative in Dujiashigou Village, Mizhi County, Suide Special District, the millet ears grew to more than a foot long due to the farmers' soil and water conservation work in the fields and the implementation of intensive cultivation. The mountain slopes, which originally could only yield five or six dou of grain per hectare, have become Fengchan fields, and this year may yield two dan of grain per hectare. Now the farmers in the old revolutionary base area of northern Shaanxi are preparing for the harvest while continuing to build earth dams and carry out soil and water conservation work during the slack season before the autumn harvest. Every plain and every gully is filled with the joyful sounds of people working. (Bai Yuan)

    陕北老根据地今年大丰收
    陕北老革命根据地的秋季庄稼快要完全成熟了。在平川里，在山峦上，漫山遍野都盖满了高粱和谷子的沉甸甸的穗子。今年陕北自开春以来，庄稼没有缺过雨水。又由于人民政府在陕北为老革命根据地农民兴修水利，领导农民修水窖、打土坝，进行水土保持工作，使陕北老革命根据地农村出现了十多年来所没有过的第一个好年成。根据现在的情况看来，过去每垧（三亩）只能打五、六斗或者三、四斗粮食的山坡地，今年估计平均可打到七、八斗；过去每垧打一担多粮食的平川地，今年估计可打到二担多。在那一片被密密层层的庄稼覆盖着的田野上，硕大的穗子压弯了那些挺拔的高粱秆，从田野上吹过的秋风都几乎吹不动它们。在绥德专区米脂县杜家石沟村的一个农业生产合作社的丰产地里，由于农民们在田地里进行了水土保持工作，实行了精耕细作的结果，谷穗子长到了一尺多长。原来一垧只能打五、六斗粮食的山坡地，变成丰产地以后，今年每垧可能打到二担粮食。现在陕北老革命根据地农民正在一面准备进行大丰收的收割工作，一面利用秋收前的农闲继续打土坝，进行水土保持工作，每一片平川、每一道山沟喧闹着人们在劳作中所发出的欢声。　（白原）
