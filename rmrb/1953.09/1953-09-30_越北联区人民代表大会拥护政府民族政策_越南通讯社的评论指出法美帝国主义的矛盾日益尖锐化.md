    (Xinhua News Agency, September 28th) According to Vietnam News Agency: From August 30th to September 10th, the National Committee of the Vietnam National United Front convened a People's Congress in the Viet Bac Inter-region of North Vietnam. Over 140 representatives from twenty different ethnic minority groups, including the Man, Miao, and Nong peoples, participated in the congress. Combat heroes and labor models selected from the guerrilla forces, farmers, and civilian workers also attended the congress.
    The congress began with a report by Brigadier General Chu Van Tan, Chairman of the Viet Bac Inter-regional Resistance Administrative Committee. In his report, he pointed out that the purpose of the meeting was to jointly study the government's policies, discuss work, and exchange experiences in order to strengthen the forces of resistance. Chu Van Tan also elaborated on the ethnic policies of the Vietnam Workers' Party and the government.
    After heated discussions, the congress unanimously passed a resolution expressing gratitude to the government and President Ho Chi Minh for their concern for ethnic minorities and the resulting improvement in their living standards, and expressing enthusiastic support for the ethnic policies of the Workers' Party, the government, and the Viet Lien Front. The resolution also called on all ethnic minority compatriots to unite more closely, smash the enemy's divisive plots, strive for an early victory in the resistance war, and defend world peace.

    (Xinhua News Agency, September 27th) The Vietnam News Agency recently published a commentary addressing the "independence" negotiations between the French government and their Indochinese puppet regimes, as well as the infighting between France and the United States on this issue.
    The commentary stated: In order to directly control the three Indochinese puppet governments, directly control military command in Indochina, and directly plunder the economic resources of Indochina, American imperialism has repeatedly urged French colonialists to grant complete "independence" to the Indochinese puppet regimes. It was under these circumstances that French Prime Minister Laniel announced on July 3rd that the French government would hold negotiations with the Vietnamese, Cambodian, and Laotian puppets to achieve the "independence" of these three member states of the Indochinese Federation.
    However, French colonialists are unwilling to relinquish all their privileges.
    In the recent negotiations with the Cambodian and Laotian puppet governments, France still insisted on retaining its military command and forced the Cambodian and Laotian puppets to remain within the French Union.
    In Vietnam, due to the sharp contradictions between the French colonialists and American interventionists, the scheduled negotiations have not officially begun two and a half months after Laniel's statement, and the puppet delegation to participate in the negotiations has not yet been formed. At the same time, the French colonialists summoned Bao Dai to France to free him from American influence and make him announce his willingness to remain within the French Union, guaranteeing his best efforts to continue the war of aggression jointly with France. They also summoned the puppet Nguyen Van Tam to France for instructions, so that he could go to the United States to deal with the American imperialists.
    In order to counter this situation, American interventionists instigated their running dogs—the former pro-Japanese Dai Viet Party—to gather representatives from some reactionary parties and religious groups in Saigon to hold a "Nationalist Conference for Peace," passing a resolution attacking Bao Dai and Nguyen Van Tam, and calling on "nationalists" to unite and strive for "independence" from France.
    The commentary pointed out: America's trick was immediately met with a counterattack from France. France tried to divide the reactionary parties and religious groups that had signed the aforementioned resolution, and instigated Cao Dai representative Pham Cong Tac, Catholic representative Le Huu Tu, and Buddhist representative Su Lien to declare their loyalty to Bao Dai. France also ordered Nguyen Van Tam to return home in order to control the conference.
    The commentary emphasized: All these facts show that although the French and American aggressors are united on the issue of aggression against Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, they both want to push each other out of Indochina.

    越北联区人民代表大会拥护政府民族政策
    越南通讯社的评论指出法美帝国主义的矛盾日益尖锐化
    【新华社二十八日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南国民联合战线全国委员会自八月三十日到九月十日在北越越北联区召开了人民代表大会。参加大会的有曼族、苗族、侬族等二十个不同少数民族的代表一百四十多人。参加大会的还有从游击队、农民和民工中选出来的战斗英雄和劳动模范。
    大会首先由越北联区抗战行政委员会主席朱文晋准将作报告。他在报告中指出会议的目的是为了共同研究政府的政策、讨论工作和交流经验，以便加强抗战力量。朱文晋并阐明了越南劳动党和政府的民族政策。
    大会经过热烈讨论后，一致通过一项决议，对政府和胡志明主席关怀少数民族、使少数民族的生活日益改善表示感谢，对劳动党、政府和越联战线的民族政策表示热烈支持。决议同时号召全体少数民族同胞更紧密地团结起来，粉碎敌人的分裂阴谋，争取抗战胜利的早日到来，并保卫世界和平。
    【新华社二十七日讯】越南通讯社最近发表评论，评论法国政府和他们的印度支那傀儡政权间进行的“独立”谈判，以及法、美间在这个问题上的勾心斗角的情形。
    评论说：美帝国主义为了直接控制印度支那三国傀儡政府，直接掌握印度支那的军事指挥权和直接搜括印度支那的经济资源，曾一再督促法国殖民者给予印度支那的傀儡政权以完全“独立”。法国总理拉尼埃就是在这种情况下，在七月三日宣布法国政府将与越南、高棉和寮国傀儡进行谈判，以实现这三个印度支那联邦成员国的“独立”。
    但是，法国殖民者不愿意放弃他所有的特权。
  法国在最近与高棉和寮国傀儡政府进行的谈判中，仍旧坚持要保留其军事指挥权，并强使高棉和寮国傀儡留在法兰西联邦里。
    在越南，由于法国殖民者和美国干涉者之间存在着尖锐的矛盾，所以预定的谈判在拉尼埃发表声明两个半月以后还没有正式开始，而且参加这次谈判的傀儡代表团还没有组成。同时，法国殖民者一面把保大叫到法国去，以使他摆脱美国的势力，并令他宣布愿意留在法兰西联邦内，保证尽力与法国共同继续进行侵略战争；一面又把傀儡阮文心召到法国去面授机宜，以便让他到美国去和美帝国主义
  者打交道。
    美国干涉者为了对付这种情况，就唆使他的走狗——前亲日的大越党——纠集一些反动党派和宗教团体的代表在西贡举行“民族主义者要求和平大会”，通过决议，攻击保大和阮文心，并号召“民族主义者”团结起来向法国争取“独立”。
    评论指出：美国的诡计立刻遭到法国的反击。法国设法分化那些曾经在上述决议上签字的反动党派和宗教团体，并唆使高台教的代表范公则、天主教代表黎有慈、佛教代表素莲宣布效忠保大。法国还命令阮文心返国，以便控制这个大会。
    评论着重指出：所有这些事实表明，法、美国侵略者虽然在侵略越南、高棉和寮国的问题上是一致的，但是彼此都想把对方从印度支那排挤出去。
