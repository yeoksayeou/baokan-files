Xinhua News Agency, August 8th: Many state-owned factories, mines, and basic construction units in Beijing are taking various measures to ensure the comprehensive overfulfillment of state plans. Twenty-five state-owned and locally state-owned factories and mines have initially formulated plans to increase production and practice thrift.

Before formulating plans to increase production and practice thrift, all factories and mines conducted a comprehensive review of their performance in completing state plans over the past eight months. Factories and mines that had already fulfilled or overfulfilled state production plans in the first half of the year, such as the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, and Shijingshan Power Plant, will continue to tap potential, further implement the recommendations of Soviet experts, and dispose of stagnant materials to increase production and income for the country. In the next four months, in addition to guaranteeing the continued completion of the state production plan, the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory will repair an additional fourteen light oil cars and four locomotives. Units that did not fully complete their plans in the first half of the year will also take various measures to increase production and practice thrift. The Jingxi Mining Bureau, which only completed 95.7 percent of its plan in the first half of the year, has paid attention to improving roof management and increasing attendance, and will produce an additional 10,000 tons of coal for the country in addition to guaranteeing the completion of the annual state plan. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, which had poor plan completion in the first half of the year due to accidents and other reasons, is also working to improve charging and other tasks in order to strive to complete the production plan for the second half of the year. Qinghe Woolen Mill, Liulihe Cement Plant, and the First Engineering Company of the Beijing Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau and other units have launched anti-waste campaigns in order to improve business management.

Currently, a competition to ensure the comprehensive overfulfillment of state plans is brewing or unfolding among the workers of various factories and mines. After discussion, all employees of the People's Printing Factory have increased the plan to increase production and practice thrift from 18.3 billion yuan proposed by the leadership to 20 billion yuan, and have decided to launch a labor competition to ensure comprehensive completion.

    北京市许多厂矿初步订出增产节约计划
    【新华社八日讯】北京市各国营工厂、矿山和基本建设单位正采取各种措施，保证全面超额完成国家计划。有二十五个国营和地方国营的厂矿已经初步制订出了增产节约计划。
    在制订增产节约计划之前，各厂矿都对八个月来完成国家计划的情况作了一次全面检查。上半年已经完成或超额完成国家生产计划的厂矿，如长辛店机车车辆修理工厂、华北农业机械总厂、石景山发电厂等，将要继续挖掘潜力，进一步贯彻苏联专家建议，处理呆滞材料，为国家增加生产、增加收入。长辛店机车车辆修理工厂在今后四个月内除保证继续完成国家生产计划外，再多修十四辆轻油车和四台机车。上半年没有全面完成计划的单位，也将采取各种措施来增产节约。上半年只完成计划百分之九十五点七的京西矿务局，已注意改进顶板管理和提高出勤率，除保证完成全年国家计划外，将再为国家增产一万吨煤。上半年因事故和其他原因完成计划较差的石景山钢铁厂，也正在设法改进装料等工作，以争取完成下半年的生产计划。清河制呢厂、琉璃河水泥厂、北京市建筑工程局第一工程公司等单位为了改进经营管理，并展开了反浪费的工作。
    目前，一个保证全面超额完成国家计划的竞赛运动正在各厂矿职工中酝酿或展开。人民印刷厂全体职工在经过讨论以后，已把领导方面提出的增产节约一百八十三亿元的计划增加到二百亿元，并决定展开劳动竞赛，保证全面完成。
