Agricultural technology stations in Suihua, Hailun, Nehe, Longjiang, Zhaodong, and other counties in Heilongjiang Province have been using tractors and large threshing machines to help nearby farmers harvest wheat this year, which has been warmly welcomed by the farmers. On August 12th, the Hailun County Agricultural Technology Station used a tractor to pull a large threshing machine to help four agricultural producers' cooperatives and one mutual aid team in five key villages, including Jianshe Village, to thresh wheat. Machine threshing is both neat and clean. As soon as the wheat touches the sharp gears, it is turned to the bottom. The wheat grains flow out from the three small holes below like running water. A pile of wheat like a small mountain is threshed in an instant. Many farmers far from the guidance station, after visiting the machine harvesting, have asked to sign contracts with the guidance station to help them harvest wheat.

    绥化等农业技术指导站用机器帮助农民收麦
    黑龙江省绥化、海伦、讷河、龙江、肇东等县农业技术指导站，今年使用拖拉机和大型脱谷机帮助附近农民打小麦，受到了农民热烈欢迎。八月十二日海伦县农业技术指导站就用拖拉机牵引大型脱谷机帮助建设村等五个重点屯的四个生产合作社和一个互助组打小麦。机器打麦，既整齐又干净，麦子一触那锋利的齿轮，就被翻到底下去了，麦粒从下边的三个小孔里，像流水一样哗哗地淌了出来。小山似的一堆麦子，霎时就打完了。许多离指导站很远的农民，在参观过用机器收麦的情况后，都要求和指导站订立合同，帮助他们收麦。
