Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 25th. Our special correspondent reports: Twenty-three American prisoners of war, one British prisoner of war, and three hundred and thirty-five South Korean prisoners of war entered the newly built prisoner of war camp near Panmunjom on the morning of the 24th. For the next four months, they will reside in the new POW camp, under the supervision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.

Despite repeated exhortations from the Korean and Chinese side to return, these prisoners of war still refused repatriation. They passed in front of the observing representatives and journalists in a calm and orderly manner. Most of them smiled as they entered the new POW camp. The healthy, blue-uniformed American and British prisoners of war arrived at the new POW camp by truck. Dark-skinned South Korean prisoners of war lined up and passed the registration table, looking calm and collected. On their way to the new barracks, they smiled at the Indian guards on both sides of the road. For these South Korean prisoners of war and non-Korean prisoners of war, this was the first time since being captured that they would live in barracks surrounded by barbed wire.

Among the South Korean prisoners of war were five women, two of whom went to the new POW camp with their husbands. One woman had a three-year-old child and was pregnant; she was sent to the POW camp hospital upon arrival.

Indian officers checked the names of the prisoners of war one by one against the complete roster provided by the Korean and Chinese side. The roster contained all the necessary information about the prisoners of war. This was in stark contrast to the situation in another area under the supervision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in the southern half of the demilitarized zone. There, the American military authorities, in order to smuggle large numbers of Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee secret agents into the POW camps, ordered their agents to force the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war to tear up their dog tags before arrival and refused to tell the Indian supervisory forces their names.

American observing representatives were also present at the handover of prisoners of war this morning. These American observing representatives, wearing armbands with the words "United Nations Forces," rushed to the place where the American and British prisoners of war got off the trucks, along with American journalists, and watched the prisoners of war pass by just outside the barbed wire fence. The observing representatives and journalists from the Korean and Chinese side watched the handover process within the designated area.

In addition to their winter luggage, the prisoners of war also brought their sports equipment and books to the POW camp. Some of them were even champions of the sports games held in Pukchong by various POW camps last fall, and wore medals from the games. A dog named "Non-Repatriation," kept by the British and American prisoners of war as a symbol of good luck, followed closely behind them into the camp.

After entering the camp, the prisoners of war were busy arranging their new homes, looking around, cleaning the yard, and some trying out the new horizontal bars and parallel bars on the playground.

The handover was completed smoothly in three hours, without any accidents. There was no flag-waving or shouting, no loud insults or disturbances, unlike the handover work in another area under the supervision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, where Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee agents blew horns and whistles, forcing the prisoners of war to create disturbances to provide excuses for American conspiracies. There were no flags hanging on the barracks where the American and British prisoners of war lived, which was not the case in the barracks in the southern part of the demilitarized zone, where Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee agents planted Kuomintang and South Korean flags around the barracks, making those barracks look like Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek's military camps.

The peaceful scenery surrounding the barracks where the American and British prisoners of war lived was also in stark contrast to the scenery surrounding the barracks in the southern part of the demilitarized zone, about one and a half miles away. The newly built yellow-roofed houses and many newly whitewashed Korean-style houses where the American, British, and South Korean prisoners of war lived were surrounded by peach trees, flowers, and rice paddies. Behind the prisoner of war housing, you could see five wooden houses and tents, which were prepared for individual explanation work for the prisoners of war. The POW camp was surrounded by rolling hills, and Korean farmers had planted crops on almost all the arable land on these hills.

The area surrounding the POW camps in the southern part of the demilitarized zone, however, was a vast expanse of barren fields, with not a single farmer in sight. The rice paddies were filled with knee-high weeds, and everywhere there were thorns. Along the road, you could see signs written in English that read, "Minefield - Do Not Approach."

### 我方移交不直接遣返战俘的情形

    我方移交不直接遣返战俘的情形
    【新华社开城二十五日电】本社特派记者报道：二十三名美国战俘，一名英国战俘和三百三十五名南朝鲜战俘在二十四日上午进入板门店附近的新建的战俘营。在今后四个月中，他们将住在新战俘营中，由中立国遣返委员会看管。
    尽管朝中方面继续劝他们回去，这些战俘仍然拒绝遣返。他们从容不迫、秩序井然地从观察代表和新闻记者面前经过。大多数人在进入新战俘营时都面带笑容。身体健壮、身穿蓝色制服的美国和英国的战俘，乘着卡车到达新战俘营。皮肤黝黑的南朝鲜战俘排成单行从登记桌前经过，神色镇静而从容。他们在到新营房的路上，向路两边的印度卫兵微笑。对这些南朝鲜战俘和非朝鲜籍战俘来说，他们是被俘以来第一次要住在四周围有铁丝网的营房之内。
    在南朝鲜战俘中有五名妇女，其中有两名是和她们的丈夫一块到新战俘营的。有一名妇女有一个三岁的孩子，并且是一个孕妇，她在到达新战俘营时就被送到战俘营医院里去了。
    印度军官们按照朝中方面供给的完备的名册逐一核对了战俘的姓名。名册上载明着有关战俘们的一切必要的材料。这和中立国遣返委员会在非军事区南半部看管的另一个地区的情况，形成鲜明的对照。在那里，美国军事当局为了把大批国民党与李承晚特务偷偷送到战俘营中，就命令他们的特务强迫朝中战俘在到达之前把他们的符号牌撕毁，并拒绝向印度看管部队讲出自己的姓名。
    美国观察代表在今天早晨移交战俘时也到场了。这些佩有“联军”字样臂章的美国观察代表，和美国新闻记者一道急急忙忙地赶到美国战俘和英国战俘下卡车的地方，并且就挨在铁丝网外面看这些战俘过去。朝中方面的观察代表和记者则都在指定的地区内看移交工作的进行。
    战俘们除了冬天用的行李外，还把他们的运动器具和书籍带到战俘营来。他们中间有些人还是去年秋天各战俘营在碧潼举行的运动会的锦标获得者，身上还佩戴着运动会的奖章。英、美战俘们所饲养的表示吉祥的一只名叫“不遣返”的小狗，也紧跟在他们的脚后进入营场。
    战俘们在进入营场后就忙着布置他们的新住处，有的到这里看看到那里看看，有的打扫院子，有几个在运动场上试试新的单杠和双杠。
    移交工作在三小时内顺利完成，自始至终没有发生一点意外。没有什么摇旗呐喊，也没有大声辱骂或骚动，根本不像中立国遣返委员会看管的另外一个地区在进行移交工作时那样，在那里，国民党和李承晚的特务吹着喇叭和哨子，强迫战俘造成骚动事件，为美国的阴谋制造口实。在美、英战俘的营房上也没有悬挂什么旗子，而在非军事区南部的营房上则不是这样，国民党和李承晚的特务在那边营房周围插了国民党和南朝鲜的旗子，把那些营房弄得就像李承晚和蒋介石的军营一样。
    美英战俘所住营房周围的和平景色，也和约一英里半以外非军事区南部的那些营房周围的景色形成强烈的对照。美、英和南朝鲜战俘所住的一些新盖的黄顶房子和许多新近粉刷过的朝鲜式房子的周围，都是桃树、鲜花和稻田。就在战俘住房的后面，可以看到五座木头房子和帐篷，这是为向战俘们个别进行解释工作预备的。战俘营周围到处都是起伏的山岭，朝鲜农民差不多已把这些山上所有可以耕种的土地都种上东西了。
    而在非军事区南部的战俘营周围却是一望无际的荒田，看不见一个农夫，稻田中是高可没膝的野草，到处都是荆棘，沿路都可以看见用英文写的这样的牌子——“地雷区——切勿走近”。
