    (Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 19th) Obviously under the instruction of the U.S. side, the special agent chief of the Li Seung-man gang, Won Yong-deok, openly threatened on the 18th that unless the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission complied with the pressure from the U.S. side to restrict the observation of the Korean-Chinese representatives when non-directly repatriated prisoners of war were sent to the demilitarized zone, he would forcibly detain all the non-directly repatriated Korean People's Army prisoners of war who had not yet been handed over to the Indian army for custody. Won Yong-deok is the special agent chief of the Li Seung-man group who, with the connivance of the U.S. side, forcibly detained 27,000 Korean People's Army prisoners of war before the armistice agreement was signed.
    Won Yong-deok's threat reflects the U.S. side's fear that the plot to forcibly detain prisoners of war will completely fail. In the past few days, before the explanation work had even started, many of our non-directly repatriated prisoners of war broke through the control of special agents and demanded immediate repatriation. This fact has made the U.S. side extremely alarmed and embarrassed. The U.S. side is attempting to use this running dog to coerce the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission into accepting its demands to undermine the armistice agreement and to restrict the observation work of the Korean-Chinese side. If this goal is not achieved, the Li Seung-man group will use this as an excuse to detain the more than 2,800 Korean People's Army prisoners of war who have not yet been handed over to the Indian troops.
    People must pay close attention to this conspiratorial activity of the Li Seung-man group under the instigation of the U.S. authorities. The Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who are still in South Korea are all under the custody of the U.S. military. If it were not for the prior conspiracy between the U.S. side and the Li Seung-man group, deliberately undermining the armistice agreement, Won Yong-deok would never be able to repeat the incident of detaining 27,000 prisoners of war on June 18. Therefore, sources here believe that the U.S. side must hand over all the prisoners of war still in their hands and guarantee that after all the prisoners of war have been transferred to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian custodial forces, it will not create collective prisoner "escape" or forced "release" incidents under any pretext. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian custodial forces must pay close attention to this major conspiracy of the U.S. side, which is aimed at seriously undermining the prisoner of war agreement.

### 美方授意李匪帮叫嚣强迫扣留我被俘人员

    美方授意李匪帮叫嚣强迫扣留我被俘人员
    【新华社开城十九日电】显然是在美方授意之下，李承晚匪帮的特务头子元容德在十八日公开威胁说，除非中立国遣返委员会顺从美方的压力，在不直接遣返战俘送到非军事区时限制朝中代表的观察，他就要将尚未交给印度军队看管的不直接遣返的朝鲜人民军被俘人员全部加以强迫扣留。元容德就是在停战协定签订以前在美方纵容下强迫扣留了二万七千名朝鲜人民军被俘人员的李承晚集团的特务头子。
    元容德发出这种威胁，反映了美方害怕强迫扣留战俘的阴谋全盘失败。过去几天中，解释工作还未开始，就有许多不直接遣返的我方被俘人员突破特务控制，要求立即遣返回国。这个事实使得美方万分惊慌和狼狈。美方企图利用这只走狗要挟中立国遣返委员会接受它的破坏停战协定的要求，限制朝中方面的观察工作。如果达不到这个目的，李承晚集团就以此为藉口，将还没有移交给印度部队的二千八百多名朝鲜人民军被俘人员扣留下来。
    人们必须严密注视李承晚集团在美国当局主使下的这个阴谋活动。现在仍留在南朝鲜的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军被俘人员都在美国军队的看管下，如果不是美方和李承晚集团预先同谋，蓄意破坏停战协定，元容德是绝不能重演六月十八日扣留二万七千战俘事件的。因此，此间人士认为，美方必须将仍在他们手中所有战俘全部交出，并保证在全部战俘移交中立国遣返委员会及印度部队看管之后，不得以任何藉口来制造战俘集体“逃亡”或强迫“释放”事件。中立国遣返委员会及印度看管部队必须对于美方的这个旨在严重破坏战俘协议的重大阴谋予以严密注意。
