The Longgao District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Bin County, Shaanxi Province, does not pay attention to the work of purchasing wheat, and its supply business is divorced from the masses. From the beginning of July to August 25th, no wheat was purchased.

After the summer harvest this year, the leaders of Bin County decided that the two market towns in Longgao District would be used as wheat purchasing points. In order to cooperate with the purchasing work, the supply business was developed, and a large amount of working capital was provided to the Longgao District Cooperative. However, the wheat purchasing work of the district cooperative was not carried out at all, and not a single grain was purchased for more than a month. The main reason for the above phenomenon is that the leaders and cadres of the Longgao District Cooperative do not attach importance to the work of purchasing wheat. In July, when the leading cadres of Longgao District asked the cooperative to publicize the rationale for purchasing grain to the masses, the director of the cooperative refused, saying, "It's enough for your district to publicize it, we don't know how to publicize it." The four cadres of the cooperative sat in the cooperative all day, waiting for the peasants to come to sell their grain. The door of the cooperative was often closed, and some peasants who came to sell grain or buy goods often could not find anyone from the cooperative. This work style of the cooperative cadres has affected the wheat purchasing work; they also mistakenly believe that: "If people don't come to sell grain, what can we do!"

Another reason for the stagnation of wheat purchasing work of the Longgao District Supply and Marketing Cooperative is that the supply business is divorced from the masses. The district cooperative dislikes farm tools such as hoes and shovels because they are bulky and heavy, and is unwilling to operate them at all; local farmers are in great need of daily necessities such as homespun cloth and edible oil, but the district cooperative has none; what they are promoting are serge, bleached cloth, thin cotton blankets, scarves, and Minsheng ink, which are not very much needed by the local farmers. Because the goods supplied do not meet the needs of local farmers, and some goods are relatively expensive, farmers are unwilling to sell wheat and buy goods at the district cooperative.

The Bin County Cooperative Union, etc., should quickly help solve the serious problems in the Longgao District Supply and Marketing Cooperative's wheat purchasing work and business operations.

### 陕西邠县龙高区供销合作社  一个多月没有收进小麦

    陕西邠县龙高区供销合作社
    一个多月没有收进小麦
    陕西省邠县龙高区供销合作社不重视收购小麦工作，供应业务脱离群众，从七月初到八月二十五日没有收进小麦。
    今年夏收后，邠县领导方面决定龙高区两个集镇作为小麦收购点；为了配合收购工作，开展供应业务，并供给了龙高区合作社大批周转资金。但该区合作社小麦收购工作完全没有开展，一个多月颗粒未收。形成上述现象的主要原因是龙高区合作社的领导和干部不重视收购小麦工作。七月间，龙高区领导干部要求该社向群众宣传收购粮食的道理时，该社主任却推说：“你们区上宣传一下就行了，我们都不会宣传。”合作社的四个干部整天坐在社里，等农民来上门求售。合作社的门还经常关着，有的农民来卖粮或买货，常常找不到合作社的人。合作社干部的这种作风，影响了小麦收购工作；他们还错误地认为：“人家不来卖粮，我们有什么办法！”
    龙高区供销合作社收购小麦工作停滞的另一个原因，是供应业务脱离群众。该区合作社嫌镢头、锄等农具笨重，根本不愿经营；当地农民很需要土布和食油等生活资料，该区合作社根本没有；推销的却是些当地农民不太需要的直贡呢、白漂布、线单子、围巾、民生墨水等。因为供应的货物不合当地农民需要，有的货物价格也比较高，农民便不愿到该区合作社卖麦买货。
    龙高区供销合作社收购小麦工作和业务经营上的严重问题，邠县合作社联合社等应迅速帮助解决。
