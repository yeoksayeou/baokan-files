Economic Work Commentary

    Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu and other provinces, as well as areas along the Songhua River, Liao River, and Hun River in Northeast China, have suffered from waterlogging to varying degrees over the past two months. Local cadres and the masses have done a lot of work to overcome this disaster, and in many places the accumulated water has been drained and breaches in river embankments have been repaired. However, in many areas, farmland is still submerged; some cadres still do not recognize the importance of draining accumulated water. Some people believe that since the crops have already been flooded, it is futile to drain the water; even if the water is drained, it may be flooded again, so it is better to let it be. Some people believe that all the water that could be drained has already been drained, and all that could be salvaged has already been salvaged; what remains is beyond help. Even if digging some more ditches could drain some more water, it would damage some farmland and cause more disputes among farmers, so it is better to avoid some trouble. These attitudes of letting things take their course and being afraid to take responsibility are wrong and violate the interests of the state and the masses. Draining the accumulated water from the fields as soon as possible is beneficial to increasing crop yields. If the accumulated water is not drained quickly, not only will the grain that is about to be harvested be ruined, but it may also delay the timely sowing of wheat, affecting next year's wheat harvest.

    In most areas, the accumulated water can be drained relatively smoothly in terms of natural conditions. However, due to the lack of unified and strong leadership, the drainage work in some areas is being carried out freely, dispersedly, and blindly, and even chaotic digging and blocking have occurred, resulting in the phenomenon of "water disaster moving house." For example, Gaojiakan Township in Luan County, Hebei Province, drained the water from more than 4,000 mu of land in its own township, but flooded more than 3,000 mu of crops in other townships. This not only delayed the drainage time, but also entangled the leadership in some mass disputes that could have been avoided, making them even more passive. Therefore, unified leadership should be strengthened, and drainage work should be done well according to the specific conditions of each place under the principle of "overall consideration of upstream and downstream, mutual support between left and right neighbors; small interests subordinate to large interests, partial interests subordinate to overall interests; large interests appropriately taking care of small interests, overall interests appropriately taking care of partial interests."

    In order to avoid and resolve disputes caused by the competition for drainage priority, the order of drainage should be arranged appropriately. For example, in areas where wheat can be grown, the water from the land where wheat is to be planted can be drained first; in areas where autumn crops still have the possibility of harvest, the areas with harvest can be drained first; in areas with different crop heights, the areas with more short crops can be drained first, and the areas with more tall crops can be drained later.

    In order to avoid and resolve disputes caused by drainage route issues, the old ditches should be dredged in order from downstream to upstream; when opening new drainage channels, a meeting of representatives of farmers from upstream and downstream should be held, and the route of digging the ditch should be decided by consultation. At the same time, the farmland of each farmer should be taken into consideration as much as possible. When draining water, natural drainage channels or wasteland, beaches, ditches on both sides of roads, etc., should be used as much as possible to reduce the occupation of land with crops. When it is necessary to occupy it, full persuasion and explanation should be given to obtain consent, and the loss of crops should be minimized when digging the ditch, and appropriate compensation should be given after the drainage. In terms of manpower mobilization, in principle, whoever benefits should contribute labor; but farmers who do not benefit should also be mobilized as much as possible to participate in drainage work in the spirit of mutual assistance.

    In these tasks, leaders at all levels must actively lead and fully rely on the masses; the resolution of all contradictions must be through consultation with the masses. On the other hand, it is also necessary to prevent stalemate and repeated consultation, where many meetings are held, a lot of arguing takes place, and the drainage time is delayed. This requires the leadership to conduct collectivist education to cadres, party members, and the masses at all levels with vivid facts to overcome departmentalism. Relevant neighboring areas can organize joint drainage committees to unify leadership. Certain disciplines should also be announced to cadres and party members, and cadres who unite, take the initiative, and quickly complete drainage tasks should be encouraged and commended in a timely manner, and cadres who engage in departmentalism, act blindly and independently, delay drainage time, or cause disputes and expand disaster areas should be criticized and even punished. These are all necessary political work and cannot be ignored or abandoned.

    The accumulated water in some areas is difficult to drain or temporarily impossible to drain due to natural conditions. For such areas, leadership should not be relaxed, but everything possible should be done to help the masses find more outlets for the accumulated water in the fields. Natural drainage channels that have obstacles or are not deep enough can be dredged. Because the water level in the river is high, and it is temporarily impossible to drain water into the river, the drainage channel must be prepared first, and when the water level drops, the opportunity can be quickly seized to drain the water from the ground. (It is necessary to grasp the water conditions upstream of the river to avoid a sudden rise in the river water during drainage, making it impossible to block the breach in time, which would cause even greater disasters.) In addition to draining water into the downstream river, the method of water storage can also be used to drain most of the accumulated water from the fields. In cases where drainage would harm the downstream or the terrain is too low and it is not easy to drain temporarily, the water from most of the fields can be temporarily released into the lowest-lying areas, retaining it for a period, and then released when the water level in the downstream drainage channel drops, under the principle of subordinating small interests to large interests and saving as much as possible. In this way, upstream crops can be protected from serious damage, and downstream areas will not expand the affected area. If there is not too much water in the fields, farmers can also be persuaded to dig water storage ponds on their own land to temporarily store the water. As long as the leading cadres can go deep into the scene, carefully observe the water conditions and terrain, visit elderly farmers or convene them for a discussion, and humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, they will definitely be able to find a way out for the accumulated water.

    During drainage, it is also necessary to properly resettle disaster victims, stabilize their emotions, and dissuade them from blindly migrating. In addition to providing necessary relief with a certain amount of food and money, efforts should be made to organize disaster victims to help themselves through production as soon as possible. All means should be used to overcome the transportation difficulties caused by the flooding, ensuring that the materials needed by the disaster areas can be supplied in a timely manner. Cadres handling loans, supplying materials, and distributing relief grain should strive to improve work efficiency and simplify procedures so that disaster victims can obtain the materials they need as soon as possible. The methods of reducing or exempting agricultural taxes in disaster-stricken areas should also be publicized and explained to the masses as soon as possible. Only in this way can the emotions of the masses in the disaster areas be stabilized, their confidence in overcoming the floods be boosted, and the drainage work can be carried out more smoothly.

    The rainy season has not yet passed, and there is still a risk of waterlogging in various places. Because the soil moisture has reached or is close to saturation, the possibility of flooding is even greater if it rains again. Areas along rivers and areas prone to waterlogging should also strengthen flood prevention and drainage work, improve and strengthen the mass organizations for flood prevention and drainage, conscientiously inspect and consolidate embankments, and repair flood prevention projects. Areas that are draining water should also consider that the drainage ditches they have dug can continue to play a role in flood prevention in the future, fully prepare the materials needed for flood prevention and rescue, and raise vigilance to prevent paralysis.

### 积极领导群众排除积水

    积极领导群众排除积水
    河北、山东、河南、江苏等省和东北的松花江、辽河、浑河沿岸的一些地区，两个月来先后遭到了水涝灾害。当地干部和群众为了战胜这个灾害，已经做了很多工作，许多地方的积水已经排出，河堤决口已经堵复。但是，也还有许多地区的农田至今仍然浸在水里；一部分干部仍然没有认识到排除积水这项工作的重要性。有些人认为：既然庄稼已经淹了，排出水去也是徒劳；即使把水排了出去，还可能再次受淹，还是听其自然吧。有些人认为，凡是能够把水排出去的，都已经排了，能够抢救的，都已经抢救了；剩下的都是没办法的了。即使再挖些沟可以再排一些水，可是要挖毁一些田地，会引起农民间更多的纠纷，还是少惹一些麻烦吧。这些放任自流、怕负责任的态度都是不对的，是违背国家和群众的利益的。尽早把田间积水排出去，对增加农作物的产量是有利的。如果不赶快把积水排出去，不但使眼看着就要收获的粮食被糟蹋掉，还可能耽误小麦的适时播种，影响明年的小麦收成。
    大部分地区的积水，就自然条件来说，是有可能比较顺利地排泄出去的。但是因为缺乏统一的有力的领导，使有些地区的排水工作自流地、分散地、盲目地进行着，甚至乱扒乱堵，发生了“水灾搬家”的现象，如河北滦县高家坎乡排出本乡四千多亩地的水，却淹了外乡的三千多亩庄稼。这就不但拖延了排水的时日，也使领导力量牵扯在一些本来可以避免的群众纠纷里面去，更加被动。因此，应当加强统一的领导，在“上下游统筹兼顾，左右邻互相支援；小利服从大利，局部服从整体；大利适当照顾小利，整体适当照顾局部”的原则下，根据各地具体情况作好排水工作。
    为了避免和解决因排水先后之争而发生的纠纷，要把排水的顺序作适当的安排。如在能种小麦的地区，可尽先把要种麦的地段的水排出；在秋庄稼仍有收获的可能的地区，可先排出有收成的地段；在作物高矮不同的地区，可先排矮作物多的地段，后排高秆作物多的地段。
    为了避免和解决因排水路线问题而引起的纠纷，在疏通旧有的水沟时，应当由下而上顺序进行；在开辟新的排水道时，要召开上下游农民代表会议，用协商的办法决定挖沟的路线，同时应尽量照顾各农户的耕地，排水时尽可能利用自然排水道或荒地、沙滩、公路两边的沟壕等等，少占用生长着庄稼的土地；在必须占用时，要经过充分的说服解释，取得同意，并且在挖沟时尽量少损失庄稼，在排水后给以适当的补偿。在人力的动员方面，原则上应是谁受益谁出工；但也应尽量动员不受益的农民本着互助精神参加排水工作。
    在这些工作中，各级领导干部要积极领导，充分依靠群众；一切矛盾的解决，都要通过群众的协商。另一方面，也要防止相持不下、辗转协商，会开了许多，争吵了很久，拖延了排水的时间。这就需要领导方面向各级干部、党员和群众用生动的事实进行集体主义的教育，克服本位主义思想。有关邻区可组织联合排水委员会，以便统一领导。对干部、党员还要宣布一定的纪律，及时鼓励、表扬团结一致、积极主动、迅速完成排水任务的干部，批评以至处分闹本位主义、盲目单独行动、延误排水时间或酿成纠纷、扩大受灾面积的干部。这些都是必要的政治工作，是不可忽视、不可放弃的。
    有些地区的积水，因为受自然条件的限制，不容易排出或者暂时无法排出。对于这样的地区，也不可放松领导，而应当尽一切可能帮助群众给田间积水多找一些出路。有些自然排水道里面有障碍或不够深的，可以加以疏浚。因为河流中水位高，一时还无法向河流中排水的，要先把排水道准备好，等到水位降低，就可以迅速掌握时机把地里的水排出去。（必须掌握住河流上游水情，以免在排水时河水陡涨，抢堵不及，反而造成更大灾害。）除了向下游河流排水以外，还可以用蓄水的办法排出大部分田地里的积水。凡是排了水之后有害于下游的或者地势太洼一时不容易排出的，可以在小利益服从大利益和尽可能多救一些的原则下，把大部分田地的水暂时放进最低洼的地方，滞留一个期间，等下游排水的河道水位降低了，就可以把水放出去。这样上游庄稼可以不受严重损害，下游也不致扩大受灾面积。田间水不太多的，也可以劝说各农户在自己地头地边挖蓄水池把水暂时蓄存起来。领导干部只要能深入现场，细心地观察水情地势，访问老年农民或召集他们开座谈会，虚心地听取群众意见，一定能够给积水找到出路。
    在排水时，还必须适当地安置灾民，稳定灾民情绪，劝阻灾民盲目外流，除拿出一定粮款予以必要救济外，要及早着手组织灾民生产自救。要用一切办法克服因水淹而造成的交通运输上的困难，保证水灾区所需要的物资能够及时供应。办理贷款、供应物资、发放救济粮的干部要力求提高工作效率，简化办事手续，使灾民尽快得到所需要的物资。受灾地区减免农业税的办法，也要早向群众进行宣传解释。这样才能稳定灾区群众的情绪，鼓舞他们战胜水灾的信心，使排水工作能够更顺利地进行。
    雨季还没有过去，各地还有继续发生水涝灾害的危险。因为土壤湿度已达到或接近饱和，再多下雨，发生水患的可能性就更大了。沿河地带和易遭内涝的地区，还应当加强防汛防涝工作，健全和加强防汛排涝的群众性组织，认真检查巩固堤防和整修防涝工程；正在排水的地区，也要考虑到所挖的排水沟道能在今后继续起防涝的作用，充分准备防汛抢险时所需的物资，提高警惕，防止麻痹。
