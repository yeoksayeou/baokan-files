Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 1st: The Plenary Session of the Soviet Peace Committee passed a resolution supporting the report of N.S. Tikhonov. The full text of the resolution is as follows:

    The Plenary Session of the Soviet Peace Committee (attended by representatives of the Peace Committees of the Soviet states, regions, and union republics, as well as representatives of Soviet social organizations), after hearing and discussing N.S. Tikhonov’s report on the achievements of the recent meeting of the World Peace Council, noted with satisfaction the achievements made by the people of all countries in the struggle for international security.

    All good people happily welcomed the Korean armistice, which is a great victory for the people of Korea and China and the entire peaceful and democratic camp.

    The Soviet people, who, along with the peace fighters of all countries, are waging an unwavering struggle for peace, believe that this victory has made it possible to peacefully resolve all other international issues.

    The elimination of the provocative and adventurous actions carried out by the warmongers in Berlin is also a great victory for the supporters of peace, who consider a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany to be a vital condition for maintaining peace in Europe and the world. The Soviet government's proposals on the German question, on the conclusion of an Austrian peace treaty, on the settlement of the Korean issue, on disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction, create a solid basis for the peaceful settlement of all international disputes through consultation, and therefore, these proposals are in line with the vital interests of peace-loving people.

    At the same time, the people of the world cannot ignore the new provocative actions of the warmongers. The aggressive blocs of the United States and other imperialist countries are trying to paralyze the vigilance of the people of all countries. While verbally advocating peace, they are actually expanding the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, establishing new military bases around the world, stepping up arms expansion, and continuing to pursue a cold war policy—a policy of provocation against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. The aggressors oppose a policy of resolving international issues on the basis of mutual agreement between the parties concerned. The decisions of the Washington Tripartite Foreign Ministers Conference and the attempts by the reactionary groups in the United States to collude with the Lee Seung-man group to sabotage the Korean negotiations are precisely for the purpose of undermining the peaceful resolution of disputes.

    Under these circumstances, peace advocates in all countries must heighten their vigilance. It is the responsibility of the people of all countries to strengthen their peace efforts.

    The resolutions of the Budapest meeting of the World Peace Council call on all good people to launch a broad international movement to strive for the peaceful settlement of disputes between countries through consultation, and to crush the plans of the aggressive forces that obstruct the achievement of agreements with active efforts to strive for peace.

    The Soviet Peace Committee announces that it fully supports the resolution adopted by the World Peace Council demanding the settlement of all international differences through consultation.

    The Soviet people have the same confidence as the millions of peace advocates in all countries that as long as there is sincerity, it is possible to find solutions to outstanding disputes, thereby guaranteeing a consolidated and lasting peace.

    The Soviet people warmly support the peace-loving foreign policy of the Soviet government, which is aimed at maintaining and consolidating peace, and this policy is in line with the vital interests of the Soviet people and the peace-loving people of all countries.

    The Soviet people, together with the peace advocates of all countries, resolutely demand an early, just, and peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, and insist on giving the Korean people full opportunities to freely decide the composition of the country and the economic and cultural development of Korea.

    All the Soviet people fully support the Soviet government's proposals for a peaceful solution to the German question, which will help Germany re-establish itself as a great power and open the way for the German people to restore their national unity and establish a democratic, peace-loving Germany. The Soviet people welcome the efforts of the German people who are fighting to turn their country into a unified, peace-loving, and democratic country, and wish them the greatest success in this regard.

    Together with the peace advocates of all countries, the Soviet people demand that the United Nations organization fulfill its responsibilities to the people of all countries. The United Nations must return to the path prescribed by its Charter and must help peacefully resolve all international conflicts on the basis of respect for the sovereignty of all countries and nations. The policy of ignoring China must be stopped. The violated rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations must be restored. Only under these indispensable conditions can the issue of maintaining and consolidating peace and international security be correctly resolved.

    The Soviet people have always advocated, and still advocate, peaceful coexistence among countries and the development of economic and cultural cooperation among countries. The purpose of the Soviet Union's domestic policy is to fully satisfy the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the Soviet people, and this policy is the best proof of our country's peaceful goals, which is warmly supported by all the Soviet people.

    The Soviet people are consistently fighting for the cause of peace. At the same time, they also keep in mind the need to raise vigilance against the conspiracies of the warmongers, constantly strengthen the defense of the great Soviet Union, and make it increasingly perfect. The Soviet people possess all the weapons of modern warfare, but have never threatened anyone and do not threaten anyone now, and they continue to firmly demand an early agreement on substantial disarmament and the prohibition of atomic, bacteriological and other weapons of mass destruction.

    The Soviet Peace Committee expresses its firm belief that all the Soviet people will warmly respond to the declaration of the World Peace Council and will actively participate in the movement to strive for a peaceful settlement of international issues, and with greater energy express to the world their unwavering will to strive for peace. They will unite more closely around the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government, which firmly and consistently adhere to a policy of peace.

    May the spirit of peaceful consultation triumph throughout the world!

    The forces of war must be defeated!

    苏联拥护和平委员会全体会议
    关于拥护吉洪诺夫报告的决议
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科一日电：苏联拥护和平委员会全体会议通过决议，拥护尼·谢·吉洪诺夫的报告。决议全文如下：
    苏联拥护和平委员会全体会议（出席这次会议的还有苏联各州、各边疆区和各加盟共和国拥护和平委员会的代表以及苏联各社会团体的代表）在听取和讨论了尼·谢·吉洪诺夫关于世界和平理事会最近一次会议的成就的报告后，满意地指出世界各国人民在争取国际安全的斗争中所取得的成就。
    一切善良的人民愉快地迎接了朝鲜停战，朝鲜停战是朝中人民和整个和平民主阵营的伟大胜利。
    正和各国和平战士一道为和平进行坚定不移的斗争的苏联人民认为，这次胜利使和平解决一切其他国际问题有了可能。
    肃清战争贩子在柏林进行的挑衅的冒险行动，也是和平拥护者的一次伟大胜利。和平拥护者认为一个统一、民主、爱好和平的德国，是维护欧洲和全世界和平的至关重要的条件。苏联政府关于德国问题、关于缔结对奥和约、关于解决朝鲜问题、关于裁减军备和禁止原子武器以及其他一切大规模毁灭人类的武器的建议，为用协商办法和平解决一切国际争端创造了巩固的基础，因而，这些建议是符合爱好和平的人民的切身利益的。
    同时，全世界人民不能忽视战争贩子的新的挑衅行动。美国和其他帝国主义国家的侵略集团企图麻痹各国人民的警惕。他们在言论上主张和平，在行动上却在扩大北大西洋侵略集团，在世界各地建立新的军事基地，加紧扩充军备，并继续奉行冷战政策——对苏联及各人民民主国家进行挑衅的政策。侵略者反对在有关方面互相协议的基础上解决国际问题的政策。华盛顿三国外长会议的决定，以及美国反动集团会同李承晚集团破坏朝鲜谈判的企图，正是为了这个破坏和平解决争执问题的目的。
    在这种情况下，各国的和平拥护者必须提高他们的警惕。各国人民有责任加强他们的和平努力。
    世界和平理事会布达佩斯会议的决议，号召一切善良人民展开一个广泛的国际运动，争取以协商方式和平解决各国间的争执问题，并以争取和平的积极努力来粉碎阻挠达成协议的侵略势力的计划。
    苏联拥护和平委员会宣布它完全拥护世界和平理事会所通过的要求以协商方式解决国际间一切分歧的决议。
    苏联人民与各国的千百万和平拥护者有完全同样的信心，相信只要有诚意就可能找出解决悬而未决的争执问题的办法，从而保证巩固持久的和平。
    苏联人民热烈拥护并支持苏联政府的旨在维护和巩固和平的爱好和平的外交政策，这个政策是符合苏联人民以及各国爱好和平人民的切身利益的。
    苏联人民与各国的和平拥护者一道，坚决要求早日公正地、和平地解决朝鲜问题，并坚持给予朝鲜人民以充分机会，来自由地决定国家的构成以及朝鲜的经济与文化发展的问题。
    全体苏联人民完全拥护苏联政府关于和平解决德国问题的建议，这个建议有助于德国重新建立为一个大国，并为德国人民开辟恢复他们的国家统一和建立一个民主的、爱好和平的德国的道路。苏联人民欢迎正在为把他们的国家变成一个统一的、爱好和平的民主国家而斗争的德国人民的努力，并祝他们在这方面获得最大的成就。
    与各国和平拥护者一道，苏联人民要求联合国组织履行它对各国人民的职责。联合国必须回到它的宪章所规定的道路，必须在尊重各个国家和民族的主权的基础上，帮助和平解决一切国际冲突。必须停止忽视中国的政策。必须恢复中华人民共和国在联合国内被侵犯的权利。只有根据这种必不可少的条件，才能确使维护和巩固和平与国际安全的问题得到正确的解决。
    苏联人民一向主张、现在仍然主张各国和平共处，主张发展各国之间的经济与文化合作。苏联的国内政策的目的在于最充分地满足苏联人民的不断增长的物质和文化的需求，这个政策就是我们国家的和平目标的最好证明，它并得到全苏联人民的热烈拥护。
    苏联人民始终不渝地为和平事业而斗争。同时，他们还牢记着有必要提高对于战争贩子的阴谋的警惕、不断地加强伟大苏联的国防工作并使之日臻完善。苏联人民拥有现代化战争的一切武器，但从来没有威胁过而且现在也没有威胁任何人，他们并且继续坚决地要求早日就大量裁减军备、禁止原子、细菌与其它大规模毁灭人类的武器达成协议。
    苏联拥护和平委员会表示坚决地相信全体苏联人民将热烈响应世界和平理事会的宣言，将以积极参加争取和平解决国际问题的运动，以更大的精力向全世界表示他们争取和平的不可动摇的意志。他们将更紧密地团结在坚定地、始终不渝地遵循和平政策的苏联共产党和苏联政府的周围。
    愿和平协商的精神在全世界取得胜利！
    战争力量必定败退！
