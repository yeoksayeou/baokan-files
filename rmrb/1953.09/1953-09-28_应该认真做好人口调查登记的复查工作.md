Reader's Letters Summary:

    Editor's note: The State Administration Council of the Central People's Government stipulates in the "National Population Census and Registration Measures": "The local population census offices may conduct sampling inspections or re-examinations during and after the population census and registration if they deem it necessary." The experience of many regions has proved that this is of great help in preventing various errors in population registration and ensuring the accuracy of population census and registration. The following reader's letter reflects the situation in Hailun County, Heilongjiang Province, where re-examination corrected errors such as duplication and omission in population census and registration. However, in some places, such as certain villages in Qing'an County mentioned in the reader's letter, a perfunctory approach was taken to the re-examination work of population census and registration, so that errors could not be corrected even after the re-examination. It is hoped that all localities will pay attention to preventing this situation when carrying out the re-examination work of population census and registration.

    Hailun County Corrects Errors in Population Census and Registration through Re-examination

    Reader Jiao Yukun writes: Hailun County, Heilongjiang Province, corrected many errors such as duplication and omission in population registration during the re-examination of population census and registration. For example, the urban area found 3,237 duplicated and omitted staff members of institutions and 2,339 members of the masses in two re-examinations. Some working cadres arbitrarily set the standard time for population census and registration on the 15th day of the fifth month of the lunar calendar, causing serious inconsistencies in the population census and registration work, and the population figures could not be calculated accurately. In addition, some cadres did not understand how to distinguish between permanent residents and those living elsewhere before registering them. For example, the Ninth Street made 44 errors in registering those living elsewhere. Besides, there were many errors in registering names, ages, householders, and other items. The facts of the population re-examination in Hailun County show that it is very necessary to carefully do the re-examination work of population census and registration in order to prevent duplication, omission, and other errors in population census and registration.

    Some Villages in Qing'an County Did Not Conduct Serious Re-examination
    There Are Still Many Errors in Population Census and Registration

    Liu Zhongzhou of the Qing'an County Election Committee in Heilongjiang Province writes: Recently, we focused on sampling the population census and registration work in some villages and found that although some villages had been re-examined by working groups, there were still many errors in population registration. For example, in 24 households in Laodong Village, there were errors in the population registration of 7 households: some omitted those living elsewhere; some registered those living elsewhere as permanent residents and issued them voter certificates; and there were many other errors. However, these errors were not discovered during the re-examination. The reason is that the working groups were perfunctory in the re-examination, thinking that everything would be fine after the population census and registration were completed. Therefore, they just held a mass meeting during the re-examination to ask everyone for their opinions, and as a result, no errors were found. This phenomenon should be corrected.

### 应该认真做好人口调查登记的复查工作

专栏：读者来信摘要

    应该认真做好人口调查登记的复查工作
    编者按：中央人民政府政务院在“全国人口调查登记办法”中规定：各地人口调查办公室“于人口调查登记进行中和完成后，如认为必要时，得举行抽查或复查”。不少地区的经验证明，这对防止人口登记中的各种错误、保证人口调查登记的准确有很大作用。下面读者来信反映黑龙江省海伦县在复查中纠正人口调查登记中重复、遗漏等差错的情况就是一个例子。但是，也有一些地方，如读者来信中反映的庆安县某些村子，却对人口调查登记的复查工作采取草率从事的做法，以致经过复查仍然不能纠正错误。希望各地在进行人口调查登记的复查工作时注意防止这种情况。
    海伦县通过复查工作
    纠正人口调查登记中的错误
    读者焦玉昆来信：黑龙江省海伦县在复查人口调查登记工作中，纠正了人口登记工作中许多重复和遗漏等差错。如：城区在两次复查中发现重复和遗漏的机关工作人员有三千二百三十七人，群众二千三百三十九人。有些工作干部擅自把人口调查登记的标准时间定在夏历五月十五日，使人口调查登记工作发生严重的不统一现象，人口数字不能精确计算。还有的干部没有弄清楚怎样分别常住人口和在外人口，就进行登记，如九街关于登记在外人口就错了四十四人。此外，在登记姓名、年龄、户主等项目中所发生的错误也不少。海伦县人口复查的事实说明：为了防止人口调查登记中的重复、遗漏等差错，认真做好人口调查登记的复查工作是很必要的。
    庆安县某些村子没认真复查
    人口调查登记仍有不少错误
    黑龙江省庆安县选举委员会刘仲舟来信：最近我们重点抽查了一些村的人口调查登记工作，发现有些村虽经工作组复查，但人口登记中仍有不少错误。如劳动村二十四户中，就有七户人口登记有错误：有的把在外人口遗漏；有的把在外人口登记为常住人口并发了选民证；其他错误还很多。可是这些错误在复查时都没有发现。其原因是：工作组在复查时草率从事，认为人口调查登记完成后就万事大吉了，于是在复查时只是开个群众大会让大家提意见，结果什么错误也发现不了。这种现象是应该纠正的。
