China's Natural Science Societies Hold Meetings in Beijing to Discuss Learning from Advanced Soviet Science and Improving Teaching

The All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies, in order to promote the work of the societies and strengthen academic activities, has held various academic discussion meetings and symposiums in the past four months. In June and July of this year, symposiums were held for the heads and experts of the science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine societies. Based on the specific circumstances of each society and in conjunction with the work of relevant departments, plans were made for autumn academic activities. The Physiology and Psychology Societies organized relevant members to participate in the Pavlovian theory study session organized by the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government. The Civil Engineering, Architecture, and Water Conservancy Societies organized some experts to participate in the "Engineering Foundation Soil Testing Discussion Meeting" held by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Ministry of Construction Engineering of the Central People's Government. From August 31 to September 9, the Mathematics, Chemistry, Zoology, and Botany Societies held academic discussion meetings in Beijing. In addition, the Physics Society held an enlarged council meeting on September 5, and the Geology Society held a symposium on learning from the advanced experience of Soviet geological exploration on August 26.

The Chinese Mathematical Society held an academic discussion meeting from September 1 to 7, attended by 33 mathematicians including Hua Luogeng, Jiang Zehan, Chen Jiangong, Su Buqing, and Duan Xuefu. At the meeting, fifteen experts gave reports on "Differential Equations," "Complex Functions," and "Functional Analysis," and eighteen papers were read. Group discussions and free speeches were also held. The meeting clarified that the future development of mathematics will be combined with the needs of production and construction, with analysis as the mainstream, but without neglecting research in other departments. On a broad basis, efforts will be focused. In the next few years, universities should gradually and selectively carry out research work based on the principle of combining teaching and research. All experts attending the meeting agreed that the meeting was very fruitful. From the specific facts cited in the special reports, they recognized the rich content of Soviet mathematics, broadened their horizons, further recognized the superiority of Soviet science, increased their confidence in scientific research, and deeply realized that scientists can learn Marxism-Leninism through their own work and establish a dialectical materialist viewpoint.

The Chinese Chemical Society held an academic discussion meeting from September 6 to 9, attended by more than 80 chemistry workers including Hou Debang, Zeng Zhaolun, Yang Shixian, and Chen Pingcheng. The meeting heard special reports on "The Structural Theory of Organic Compounds" and "The Relationship between Chemical Teaching in Universities and Middle Schools," and group discussions and summaries were conducted. The discussion of organic chemical structure problems was to prepare conditions for offering courses on organic chemical structure theory in organic chemistry majors. In the discussion of this issue, the idealistic mediation theory and resonance theory were criticized. In the discussion of the teaching relationship between high schools and middle schools, in view of the past situation that teachers in universities and middle schools did not understand each other's teaching work, the teaching syllabus was repeatedly changed, the teaching level of each school was uneven, and there were differences in teaching methods, resulting in difficulties in teaching, teachers from universities and middle schools introduced the principles, tasks, content, and textbooks of the teaching syllabus to each other, and raised related questions for joint discussion. The meeting believed that in the future, they should jointly study the teaching syllabus and textbooks, help each other, and hold regular contact symposiums.

The Enlarged Council of the Chinese Physical Society was held from September 5 to 9. The meeting focused on discussing some problems in physics teaching in universities and middle schools across the country, mainly how to absorb advanced Soviet experience and combine it with China's actual situation to improve physics teaching in universities and middle schools. After full discussion, the meeting clarified the purpose of general physics teaching in universities. Middle schools raised some opinions on the newly compiled textbooks that are currently in use. The meeting affirmed the advantages of the newly compiled textbooks, believing that the newly compiled textbooks are basically suitable for middle school physics teaching and are welcomed by teachers and students, and also pointed out some areas that deserve improvement. In order to help attendees have a correct understanding of learning from the Soviet Union, Qian Sanqiang, vice chairman of the society, made a report on "My Understanding of Soviet Physics Work." The meeting also heard two reports on "The Purpose of General Physics Teaching in Universities" and "The Reform of Physics Teaching in Middle Schools and the Direction of Future Efforts." After discussion, the meeting clarified the policy and tasks of the Physics Society. The meeting pointed out that the Physics Society is a mass academic organization and should be a good assistant to relevant government departments. The task in the future is to learn from advanced Soviet science, continue to improve teaching work, and create conditions for carrying out research work. The meeting also discussed the affairs of the Physics Society. More than 60 people attended the meeting, including Zhou Peiyuan, Qian Sanqiang, Ye Qisun, Lu Xueshan, heads of local branches of the society, directors, and specially invited representatives.

The "Darwinism Foundation Symposium" held by the Chinese Zoological and Botanical Society was held on August 31. More than 50 zoologists and botanists including Shen Qiyi, Qian Chongshu, Zhou Jianren, Shen Tong, and Zhang Jingyue attended the meeting. The meeting heard reports on the study of the foundations of Darwinism and teaching experience in universities and middle schools, exchanged learning experiences, and solved some teaching problems. Discussions were also held on the issue of "no struggle within species," and the view of "struggle within species" was criticized.

The Chinese Geological Society held a symposium on learning from the advanced experience of Soviet geological exploration on August 26. More than 20 geologists and geological exploration team leaders including Sun Yunzhu, Huang Jiqing, Guo Wenkui, Huang Yi, and Wang Yuelun attended the meeting. At the meeting, everyone exchanged their deep understanding in their work practice on how to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and combine it with China's actual situation in geological exploration.

    我国各自然科学专门学会在北京举行会议
    讨论学习苏联先进科学和改进教学等问题
    中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会为了推动学会工作，加强学术活动，在最近四个月内分别举行了各种学术讨论会和座谈会。在今年六、七月间分别召开了理、工、农、医四方面的学会负责人和专家座谈会，根据各学会具体情况结合有关部门工作，订出秋季学术活动计划。生理及心理两学会组织有关的会员参加了中央人民政府卫生部主办的巴甫洛夫学说学习会；土木、建筑、水利三个学会组织了部分专家参加了中国科学院和中央人民政府建筑工程部举办的“工程地基土壤检验讨论会”。八月三十一日到九月九日间又有数学、化学、动物、植物等四个专门学会分别在京举行了学术讨论会，另外物理学会在九月五日召开了扩大理事会，地质学会在八月二十六日举行了学习苏联地质勘探先进经验座谈会。
    中国数学会学术讨论会在九月一日到七日举行，参加会议的有华罗庚、江泽涵、陈建功、苏步青、段学复等三十三位数学家。会上十五位专家做了关于“微分方程”“复变函数”“泛函分析”三部门的报告，宣读了十八篇论文，并进行了小组讨论和自由发言。会议明确认识了今后数学发展将结合生产建设的需要，以分析学为主流，但并不偏废了其他部门的研究工作，而是在广泛的基础上，重点使用力量。在今后几年内高等学校应根据教学与研究相结合的原则，逐步地重点地开展研究工作。出席会议的各位专家一致认为这次会议收获很大，从各专题报告中所举的具体事实中，认识了苏联数学的丰富内容，扩大了眼界，进一步认识了苏联科学的优越性，增加了科学研究的信心，深刻地体会到科学家可以通过自己业务，学习马克思列宁主义，树立辩证的唯物观点。
