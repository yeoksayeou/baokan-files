To implement the Election Law and carry out universal suffrage work, the first batch of grassroots election work in various counties of Songjiang Special District, Jiangsu Province, began in mid-August, steadily unfolding in 290 townships and towns. These townships and towns are now deeply engaged in universal suffrage publicity and education, combining it with drought resistance and autumn harvest protection, and utilizing production gaps.

In mid-May, various counties in Songjiang Special District began pilot projects for grassroots elections. Through these trials, county and district leaders generally gained experience in conducting grassroots election work. Simultaneously, through the pilot projects, counties trained 1,538 cadres to guide grassroots election work and 1,866 personnel to handle election technical work, preparing the organizational groundwork for the first batch of grassroots elections. Each county dispatched 34 people's tribunals to ensure the smooth progress of grassroots election work.

During cadre training, while conducting universal suffrage education, each county focused on clarifying the relationship between universal suffrage and production ideologically, and how to center on production to complete election work. They also studied specific methods for integrating election work with production. Before the first batch of grassroots elections began, each county focused on studying publicity and education work. Shanghai County and other counties convened representative meetings of propagandists to unify the deployment of universal suffrage propaganda work in conjunction with production. Some counties also formulated specific plans for conducting universal suffrage publicity and education among women.

In early August, the Songjiang Special District Universal Suffrage Office convened a joint meeting of heads of county election committees, pilot work groups, democratic women's federations, and the Communist Youth League to summarize and exchange the basic experiences of grassroots election pilot projects. The meeting emphasized that overcoming natural disasters is key to ensuring a bumper autumn harvest this year, and therefore, universal suffrage work must be firmly integrated with production, and the universal suffrage movement must promote production. After the meeting, the Songjiang Special District Universal Suffrage Office organized production and universal suffrage work inspection teams, which went separately to Chuansha, Shanghai, Jinshan, and other three counties to conduct inspections.

Sichuan Province's Dangui Township Completes Universal Suffrage Work
Miao and Han People Enthusiastically Participate in Voting

The grassroots election in Dangui Township, Xuyong County, Sichuan Province, where Miao and Han ethnic groups live in mixed communities, has been completed. Miao and Han voters equally exercised their right to vote.

Among the 86 people who participated in the township's voter eligibility review group, 30 were from the Miao ethnic group. They jointly reviewed the voter qualifications of the entire township. For example, Cao Fangzhen and other Han landlord class elements who concealed their history and stole the right to vote were exposed by Miao people such as Wang Xuelin, and their voter certificates were legally recovered. At the same time, the issue of voter eligibility for the Miao people was also handled carefully and prudently. During the process of deliberating and proposing representative candidates, many outstanding figures from the Miao ethnic group were unanimously nominated by Han voters. Among the nine Miao candidates in the township, five were initially proposed by Han voters. The opinions of Miao voters were also given sufficient attention when deliberating on representative candidates.

Han and Miao representative candidates were enthusiastically supported by voters throughout the township at the election meeting. Han candidate Wang Qikun and Miao candidate Wang Xuelin both received more than 98% of the votes. In the fifth electoral district, when three Han representative candidates and four Miao representative candidates were elected as people's representatives, the voters presented them with large red flowers, and Miao female voter Ma Wenchao even sang a Miao celebration song for them. As a result of the township-wide election, a total of 35 representatives were elected, including nine Miao representatives. At the first township people's congress, three representatives, including Miao Wang Xuelin, were elected as the deputy township head and members of the township people's government respectively, giving the Miao people representatives with status commensurate with their position in the township people's congress.

Dangui Township is a mountainous township in southern Sichuan Province, with 2,143 people in the entire township, including 332 Miao people. Before liberation, the Miao people living in the township had no political rights whatsoever. In this universal suffrage, they deeply felt the greatness of Chairman Mao's ethnic policy, and therefore actively participated in the election activities. 99% of Miao voters in the township participated in the voting.

Guizhou Province's Guizhu County Ethnic Minority Mixed Residence Areas
Carrying Out Universal Suffrage Work According to Local Characteristics

Chenliang Township (ethnic minority mixed residence area) in Guizhu County, Guizhou Province, conscientiously implemented the policy of ethnic unity in the process of universal suffrage work, enabling all voters in the township to actively participate in the universal suffrage movement.

Chenliang Township has four natural villages with a total of 3,366 people. Among them, 1,886 are Yi, 1,269 are Han, and 211 are Miao. Based on this situation, Chenliang Township focused on the following issues when carrying out universal suffrage work:

First, pay attention to solving the problems involving the customs and habits of ethnic minority people in the universal suffrage. In Chenliang Township, the population survey encountered the problem of "not sitting at home." Generally, after Yi men and women marry, women have to live in their natal home until after they have their first child, and then they live permanently in their husband's home, which is called "sitting at home;" those who stay in their natal home without having children are called "not sitting at home." Regarding the issue of where to register the population of women "not sitting at home," the work group initially proposed to register them in their natal home if they live in their natal home, but the parents-in-law did not agree, saying that if my daughter-in-law is not registered in my home, then the daughter-in-law does not belong to my family. After consultation and agreement between the two parties, they were registered as permanent residents in their natal home and as external population in their husband's home. If they have voter qualifications, they participate in elections in the electoral district where their natal home is located. They were very satisfied with this arrangement. In addition, attention was also paid to the customs and habits of ethnic minorities, and their grand festivals were respected. The eighth day of the fourth month of the lunar calendar (May 20) is a grand festival for the ethnic minority people throughout the township. On that day, in order to respect the customs of ethnic minorities, the township election committee suspended universal suffrage work for one day, allowing ethnic minority people to celebrate their own festivals, visit and pay homage according to ethnic minority customs, which made the voters very satisfied.

Secondly, do a good job in ethnic unity in electoral districts where there are gaps between ethnic groups, and propose good candidates. For example, there are some gaps between the Yi and Miao ethnic groups in Xiaowo Village. When nominating representative candidates, the Miao and Yi ethnic groups each had one candidate. During the discussion, the Yi ethnic group did not agree with the Miao candidate, and the Miao ethnic group did not agree with the Yi candidate, and the two ethnic groups proposed other candidates to each other. At that time, unity education was carried out among the people of the two ethnic groups, and representative figures with high prestige among the two ethnic groups were convened for discussion and consultation. At the meeting, the representative candidates of the two ethnic groups reviewed some shortcomings and errors in their past work, which won the understanding of the representatives attending the meeting. When continuing to discuss candidates, everyone unanimously approved the representative candidates proposed by the Miao and Yi ethnic groups. At the same time, the two ethnic groups were united.

Thirdly, carry out work through ethnic minority cadres and activists. Ethnic minority cadres and activists are familiar with the local language, customs, and habits, and it is easy to solve problems related to ethnic minorities. They use their own language to promote, which is most welcomed by the masses. For example, in the Yangzhong electoral district, where the Yi ethnic group lives, publicity was carried out by Yi village cadres, and the masses responded very well and were in high spirits when meeting.

    贯彻选举法，开展普选工作
    江苏省松江专区各县结合抗旱
    保秋进行首批基层选举工作
    江苏省松江专区各县第一批基层选举工作，从八月中旬开始，在二百九十个乡、镇先后稳步展开。这些乡、镇现在正结合抗旱保秋，利用生产空隙，深入地进行普选宣传教育。
    五月中旬，松江专区各县即开始基层选举典型试办，在试办中，县、区领导方面一般地都取得了进行基层选举工作的经验，同时，通过试办各县还训练了一千五百三十八名指导基层选举工作的干部，训练了一千八百六十六名担任选举技术工作的人员，为第一批基层选举工作做好了组织准备。各县共派出了三十四个人民法庭，保障基层选举工作顺利地进行。
    各县在训练干部中，在进行普选教育的同时，着重使干部从思想上明确认识普选和生产的关系，如何以生产为中心，围绕生产来完成选举工作。并研究了结合生产进行普选工作的具体做法。在第一批基层选举展开之前，各县着重研究了宣传教育工作。上海县等县召开了宣传员代表会议，统一布置了结合生产进行普选宣传的工作。有的县还订出了向妇女群众进行普选宣传教育的具体计划。
    八月上旬，松江专署普选办公室曾召开各县选举委员会、试办工作组、民主妇联、青年团等单位负责人联席会议，总结和交流了基层选举典型试办的基本经验。会议强调指出，战胜自然灾害是确保今年秋熟丰收的关键，因而普选工作必须坚定不移地结合生产进行，并使普选运动推动生产。会后，松江专区普选办公室组织生产和普选工作检查组，分头到川沙、上海、金山等三个县进行检查。
    四川省丹桂乡完成普选工作
    苗、汉族人民热烈参加投票
    苗、汉两族杂居的四川省敍永县丹桂乡已完成基层选举。苗族选民和汉族选民一道，平等地行使了选举权利。
    参加全乡选民资格审查小组的八十六人中，有苗族三十人。他们共同审查了全乡的选民资格。例如隐瞒历史窃取选举权利的汉族地主阶级分子曹芳珍等，经苗族王学林等揭发后，依法追回了选民证。同时，对于苗族人民的选民资格问题，也同样做到了认真审慎。在酝酿提出代表候选人中，很多苗族的优秀人物受到汉族选民的一致提名。全乡九个苗族候选人，就有五名是由汉族选民首先提出的。在酝酿代表候选人时，苗族选民的意见也得到了足够的重视。
    汉、苗两族的代表候选人，在选举大会上受到了全乡选民的热烈拥护。汉族王启坤和苗族王学林都得到了百分之九十八以上的选票。在第五选区，当三个汉族代表候选人四个苗族代表候选人当选为人民代表后，选民们给他们戴上了大红花，苗族女选民马文超还特别为他们唱了一支苗族的庆贺歌子。全乡选举结果，共选出代表三十五人，其中有苗族代表九人。在第一次乡人民代表大会上，苗族王学林等三代表又分别被选为乡人民政府的副乡长和委员，使苗族人民在乡人民代表大会中有与他们地位相当的代表。
    丹桂乡是四川省南面一个山区乡，全乡二千一百四十三人中，有苗族三百三十二人。解放前，住在该乡的苗族人民毫无政治权利可言。在这次普选中，他们切身体会到毛主席民族政策的伟大，因而积极参加选举活动，全乡百分之九十九的苗族选民都参加了投票。

    贵州省贵筑县民族杂居区
    根据当地的特点开展普选工作
    贵州省贵筑县陈亮乡（民族杂居区），在普选工作过程中认真执行了民族团结政策，使全乡选民积极投入普选运动。
    陈亮乡有四个自然村，共三千三百六十六人。其中彝族占一千八百八十六人，汉族一千二百六十九人，苗族二百一十一人。根据这种情况，陈亮乡在开展普选工作时着重注意到下面几个问题：
    首先注意解决普选中涉及少数民族人民的风俗习惯的问题。陈亮乡在人口调查中，遇到了“不坐家”问题。一般彝族男女结婚后，女子要在娘家住到生了头一个孩子以后，再到婆家常住，称为“坐家”；没有生孩子留在娘家的称为“不坐家”。关于“不坐家”妇女的人口在那里登记问题，开始工作组提出住在娘家就在娘家登记，但婆家父母不同意，说我的媳妇不在我家登记，那媳妇就不是我家的了。经与双方协商征得同意后，在娘家登记为常住人口，在婆家登记为在外人口，若有选民资格的，并在娘家所在选区参加选举。这样处理，他们很满意。又如夫妇系不同民族，所生的子女属于那个民族的问题，必须征求夫妇双方同意再登记。如杨中选区汉族陈银章之妻是彝族，有两个男孩，一个女孩。陈银章本来想把三个孩子都登记为汉族，但他的妻子不同意，经夫妻商量后，才得到了合理解决。此外，还注意到少数民族的风俗习惯，尊重他们隆重的节日。农历四月初八（五月二十日），是全乡少数民族人民的隆重节日。当天，乡选举委员会为了尊重少数民族风俗，普选工作停止了一天，让少数民族人民欢度自己的节日，按照少数民族风俗游览、祭奠，选民们很满意。
    其次，在民族之间有隔阂的选区，做好民族团结工作，提好候选人。如小窝寨彝族和苗族之间有些隔阂，代表候选人提名时，苗、彝两族各有候选人一人。讨论时，彝族不同意苗族的候选人，而苗族也不同意彝族的候选人，两族又互相另提。当时就对两族人民，进行团结教育，并召集两族当中威信较高的代表人物进行座谈协商。会上，由两族代表候选人对过去工作中的某些缺点和错误作检讨，取得了与会代表的谅解。在继续讨论候选人时，大家一致通过了苗、彝两族各自所提出的代表候选人。同时两族之间也团结了。
    再次，通过少数民族干部和积极分子进行工作。少数民族干部和积极分子熟悉当地的语言、风俗、习惯，碰到有关少数民族的问题，容易解决。他们用本民族的语言去宣传，也最受群众的欢迎。如彝族聚居的杨中选区，由彝族村干部进行宣传，群众反映很好，开会时情绪很高。
