    Shandong Province Cooperatives Actively Prepare Cotton Processing Capacity
    Shandong Province cooperatives are actively preparing cotton processing capacity to welcome the new cotton procurement work.
    Last year, Shandong Province cooperatives did not adequately prepare cotton processing capacity in advance. In addition, last year's cotton purchasing lacked seasonal price differences, causing excessive congestion when the cotton was listed on the market. Power-driven processing plants could not be fully started after the new cotton was listed, and manual cotton gins could not be organized in time. As a result, a large amount of seed cotton was accumulated, which slowed down the turnover of funds and caused difficulties in the storage of seed cotton. In some areas, cotton stored in the open air rotted.
    The Shandong Provincial Cooperative Headquarters learned from last year's lessons and convened a work conference of processing plant directors in late June to make specific arrangements for cotton processing preparations. At present, the vast majority of power-driven processing plants have been fully prepared. The processing plants in major cotton-producing areas, such as Dezhou, Liaocheng, Huimin, Jiaozhou, and Changwei, can generally guarantee to start work on time. Yucheng Processing Plant has sufficient spare parts for its machines, and workers have proposed to carry out competitions. The processing plants in Pingyuan, Zhucheng and other counties have prepared two sets of cylinders and cylinder tops for their diesel engines to ensure uninterrupted processing. However, the preparation work in a few areas is not yet sufficient. For example, the processing plants in Liaocheng, Fucheng, and Liaolan cannot yet guarantee to start work on time.
    This year's new cotton procurement work will be carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner, and the listing of cotton on the market will not be excessively congested. However, after the new cotton is purchased, it still needs to be processed quickly and transported in time to avoid cotton losses. Cooperatives in various regions should never relax their preparations for cotton processing because the amount of cotton listed on the market in September and October this year will not be as congested as in previous years.

    山东省各地合作社积极准备棉花加工力量
    山东省各地合作社积极准备棉花加工力量，迎接新棉收购工作。
    去年山东省各地合作社因为事先对棉花加工力量准备不足，加以去年收棉没有季节差价，棉花上市过分拥挤，在新棉上市后动力加工厂不能全部开工，人力轧花机不能及时组织起来，结果籽棉大量积压，使资金周转迟缓，籽棉保管发生困难；有的地区露天存放的棉花，发生了霉烂等现象。
    山东省合作总社接受了去年的教训，今年六月下旬便召开加工厂厂长工作会议，对棉花加工准备工作作了具体布置。目前绝大部分动力加工厂都已作了充分准备。主要产棉地区，如德州、聊城、惠民、胶州、昌潍等专区的加工厂大都能保证按时开工。禹城加工厂机器备件有了充分准备，工人并提出要开展竞赛；平原、诸城等县的加工厂，柴油机上的汽缸、汽顶都准备了两套，保证不误加工。但少数地区准备工作还不充分，如聊城、复程、蓼兰等县的加工厂，现在还不能保证按时开工。
    今年新棉收购工作将有计划地按步进行，棉花上市不致过分拥挤，但新棉收购起来以后，仍需迅速加工，及时转运，以免棉花遭受损失。各地合作社绝不应因今年九、十月份棉花上市量将不如往年拥挤而放松了棉花加工的准备工作。（李青林）
