    Since arriving in Beijing on August 31st, our Second Remains Escort Group has received friendly hospitality from the Chinese Red Cross Society, various organizations, and the people of your country. We express our deepest gratitude for this.

    Originally, our mission was to escort the remains of the martyred heroes and to apologize to your country on behalf of the Japanese people. However, not only did we not receive any reprimands, but we were also warmly welcomed, for which we are extremely grateful.

    During our stay in China, we were deeply moved by the great development of your country and the enthusiasm of your people for peace.

    We believe that after returning home, we should accurately convey the truth about your country to the Japanese people and correct the erroneous propaganda and perceptions.

    We believe we have an obligation to convey to the Japanese people that the people of your country hate Japanese militarism and strongly oppose its revival.

    Finally, let us vow to fight for Sino-Japanese friendship and the return of the remains. We offer this only as words of farewell.
