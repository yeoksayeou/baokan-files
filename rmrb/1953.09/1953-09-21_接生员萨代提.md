    Midwife Sadeti
    By Our Correspondent Zhu Bo

    In the Kokesek pasture, the Kirgiz people love Sadeti as much as herdsmen love the warm spring. People gather around her to ask about her well-being as soon as they see her. Children vie for the reins of her horse; women compete to pull her into their yurts, inviting her to drink mare's milk or eat lamb, specially saved for her.

    The Kirgiz people love Sadeti because she improved midwifery and saved the lives of many mothers and babies.

    In promoting the new midwifery methods, Sadeti encountered various difficulties. When she first returned from studying midwifery in Tekes County, Kirgiz women were unwilling to approach her. When she was mentioned, they would secretly laugh, saying that she had learned bad things in the county town. Some gossiping women complained that she had told outsiders about Kirgiz women giving birth, and some even blamed her for learning midwifery from men. Sadeti felt very uncomfortable hearing these words. However, she did not lose heart and was not conquered by the difficulties. She kept her teacher's words in mind: "You will definitely encounter difficulties in your work, don't be afraid of them. Your mission is to overcome these difficulties and rescue Kirgiz mothers and babies..." She felt that as long as she explained the principles clearly, the women would accept the new midwifery methods.

    Wulijiang'er was a Kirgiz woman who often helped others with childbirth. Sadeti decided to talk to her. Wulijiang'er saw Sadeti in front of her yurt and asked, "What do you want from me? Are you here to talk about new midwifery methods again! Go and talk to those who are willing to listen to you, I don't like to listen!" Sadeti wanted to explain to her, but Wulijiang'er went into the yurt before she could speak. Sadeti heard accusations coming from inside the yurt: "The habits left by our ancestors have been destroyed by her!"

    On another occasion, the township head Almanbaiti (Kirgiz) said to Sadeti, "The township people's government has agreed with the women's literacy class that you can talk to them about maternal and infant hygiene before class." Sadeti was very happy to receive this notice. Who knew she would run into a snag again. As soon as the new midwifery method was mentioned in front of the women in the literacy class, the meeting became chaotic. Older women pulled their daughters away, shouting, "We are here to learn culture, who wants to listen to midwifery methods? It's so indecent to talk about childbirth in front of everyone!" Failing for the second time, Sadeti quietly left with unpleasant feelings.

    After two failures, Sadeti felt depressed for several days, sometimes even forgetting to boil tea. What should she do? Could difficulties make her bow her head? As she thought, images of Kirgiz women suffering during childbirth appeared before her eyes, and she also remembered the faces of those women who had died from childbirth. Thinking of this, she felt guilty. In the past, for Kirgiz women, it would be more appropriate to say "torture" than "childbirth." Before a pregnant woman gave birth, her mother-in-law and husband would invite neighbors to tie a woolen rope to the top of the yurt and spread an old felt on the floor. Several strong women would hold the pregnant woman up, letting her stand and grab the woolen rope tightly. Then, several women would hold the pregnant woman's belly and press down hard; the pregnant woman would faint, and blood would flow all over the floor. If there was a difficult birth, the pregnant woman would suffer even more. Many mothers and babies lost their lives or became disabled as a result.

    Thinking of this, Sadeti clenched her fists and said, "We can no longer live according to the old habits. To eliminate the pain of childbirth for women and to protect the next generation of Kirgiz people, I must persevere in my work."

    Sadeti went to Bulmahan, whom she was usually closer to, and said to her, "Why can't many of the children born to our Kirgiz women survive?" Bulmahan replied, "That is arranged by 'Khuda' [1], who can know?" Sadeti retorted, "Why are there so many children of Uyghur and Russian nationalities!" Bulmahan was embarrassed by the question and lowered her head. She remembered the pain she had suffered when giving birth. Bulmahan said painfully, "Everyone is afraid of giving birth, but what can be done? I talked to Xiatipati a few days ago, and I was sad for a long time. You know she had three or four children before, but they died as soon as they were born. My illness was caused by giving birth!" Sadeti felt that Bulmahan's thinking had changed, so she told her about the new midwifery method and said with certainty, "If the new method is used for delivery, the safety of the mother and baby can be guaranteed." After hearing this, Bulmahan said, "You are right, the old method can no longer be used. There are fewer and fewer Kirgiz people, more deaths than births, and more old people than children. I can go to Xiatipati and ask her to come to you. She is probably pregnant again." Through the propaganda and education of Bulmahan, Xiatipati, and others, more and more women came to Sadeti. Even at a township-wide women's meeting, many women asked her to talk about the new midwifery method. She went on stage and said to the women, "Sisters, we must implement the new midwifery method, but some people say that it will destroy the habits left by our ancestors. Think about how much disaster this old habit has brought to our women! Which mother has not suffered a serious illness during childbirth? Which family has not lost a baby? If this continues, our Kirgiz people will be wiped out! We must use the new midwifery method to ensure the safety of mothers and babies and to make the Kirgiz population prosper!" Through Sadeti's continuous efforts, Kirgiz women gradually believed in the new midwifery method.

    Now, people can't do without Sadeti. In her yurt, people often come to her for advice, some to ask her to deliver babies, some to ask her to check the fetal position, and some to ask her to explain the precautions during pregnancy.

    Once, Xiatipati ran to Sadeti and said, "I am very scared after pregnancy, I am afraid I will not survive this time." Sadeti comforted her and said, "Don't be afraid, the new method of delivery can ensure that the child is not in danger, and there are ways to deal with difficult births. However, you should pay attention not to do heavy work, eat palatable food, and wear loose clothes." She also told her to prepare some clean wool in advance, boil it in water, and prepare some new cloth for use during childbirth. In this way, Xiatipati calmed down.

    Kalamahapa also came on horseback. He said to Sadeti in a panic, "I sincerely ask you to help me! My wife Shali has been in labor for more than ten days, and the child has not been born yet, and Shali is about to bleed to death." Kalamahapa's anxious eyes were filled with tears. Sadeti picked up her headscarf and said, "Let's go, let me see if I can think of a solution." She went to Kalamahapa's house and saw Shali holding the rope with both hands, her face tortured like white paper, and her eyes sunken into their sockets. The neighbors surrounded her helplessly. Sadeti quickly helped the pregnant woman up and asked her to lie down. After examination, she found that the fetal position was transverse. Sadeti also felt that this situation was tricky, so she immediately sent the pregnant woman to the hospital.

    When Sadeti accompanied Shali and returned with the newborn baby in her arms, the Kirgiz people laughed, and some jokingly said, "If it weren't for Sadeti, Kalamahapa might have become a bachelor." Kalamahapa happily held Sadeti's hand tightly and said, "I sincerely thank you, you saved Shali and my child. To celebrate your victory, I will take out a 'Buzkashi' [2]."

    Musa's wife, whose name is Gu'ersunhan, is twenty-one years old this year, and this is her first pregnancy. One day, while she was milking a horse, she was hit by the horse, and her stomach started to hurt. Musa was going to ask Sadeti for help, but her mother Si'yate was an old-fashioned woman and would not let her go. Musa secretly ran to Sadeti and invited Sadeti. Sadeti helped her correct the fetal position and used a cloth to support the pregnant woman's belly.

    As the saying goes, "You reap what you sow," Sadeti's efforts were not in vain, and the work of promoting new midwifery methods was carried out among the masses.
  
  [1] "Khuda" means "God."
  [2] "Buzkashi" is a game played by herdsmen during happy events. The method is: the person making the happy event takes out a goat (cannot be a sheep), cuts off the goat's head, and the herdsmen ride horses to compete for it. The one who gets the goat in the end is considered the winner; the winners are often those who have good riding skills and strength, and the horses are also the best. The number of people participating in this game varies, sometimes dozens, sometimes hundreds. (Attached picture)

    接生员萨代提
    本报记者　朱波
    在库克塞克牧场，柯尔克孜族同胞，就像牧人爱好温暖的春天那样地喜爱着萨代提。人们一看见她，就凑过来问寒问暖。孩子们争夺她手里的马缰绳；妇女们则争着拉她到自己的帐房里，请她喝马奶子，或者请吃特别为她收藏起来的羊羔肉。
    柯族人民所以热爱萨代提，是因为她改进了接生法，挽救了许多母亲和婴儿的生命。
    在推广新接生法中，萨代提曾遇到种种的困难。她刚从特克斯县学习接生法回来的时候，柯族妇女都不愿意接近她，一提起她，总是偷偷地笑着，说她上县城去学坏了。好事的妇女抱怨她把柯尔克孜族妇女生孩子的事告诉了外人，有的甚至责备她不该向男人学习接生。萨代提听了这些话，感到很难受。但是，她并没有气馁，没有为困难所征服。她牢记着老师的话：“在工作中一定会遇到困难的，不要怕困难。你们的使命就是要克服这些困难，解救柯尔克孜族的母亲和婴儿……。”她觉得，只要把道理说清楚，妇女们是会接受新接生法的。
    吾里江尔是一个常帮助别人接生的柯族妇女。萨代提决心去找她谈一谈。吾里江尔在帐房门前看到萨代提，就问道：“你来找我有什么事情？莫非又要谈什么新接生法吧！去向那些愿意听你话的人讲吧，我不爱听！”萨代提想向她解释一下，但是吾里江尔不等她开口就钻进帐房去了。萨代提在帐房外边听到了从里面传出来的责难声：“我们祖先留下来的习惯叫她给破坏了！”
    又有一次乡长阿尔曼拜提（柯族）对萨代提说：“乡人民政府已经和妇女识字班说好，上课前你可以去和她们讲一讲妇婴卫生。”萨代提接到这个通知以后，心里很高兴。谁知道她又碰了一个钉子。在识字班的妇女面前一提到新接生法，会场的秩序就乱了。上了年纪的妇女拉着自己的姑娘就走，嘴里嚷着：“我们是来学文化的，谁愿听什么接生法，在众人面前谈论生孩子的事，多么不体面！”第二次又失败了，萨代提带着不愉快的心情悄悄地离开了。
    经过两次失败，萨代提一连几天感到闷闷不乐，有时连茶也忘记烧了。怎么办呢？困难能使人低头吗？她想着，眼前出现了柯尔克孜族妇女在生育中遭受痛苦的景象，也忆起了那些因生育而死亡的妇女的面孔。一想到这里，她受到内心的责备。过去，对于柯族妇女，说“生育”不如说“折磨”更恰当些。在孕妇临产前，婆婆和丈夫就请来了邻居，把一根毛绳拴在帐房的顶上，房中铺上一块破旧的毡子，由几个有力气的妇女扶着产妇，让她站起来抓紧毛绳。然后，就由几个妇女抱着产妇的肚子用力向下压；产妇昏过去，血水流了满地。如果遇到难产，产妇受到的痛苦更是厉害。有许多母亲和婴儿因而失去了生命，或者变成了残废。
    想到这里，萨代提握紧拳头说：“不能再按着旧习惯生活下去了，为了免除妇女的生育痛苦，为了保护柯族的下一代，我要坚持工作下去。”
    萨代提到了平时比较接近的布尔玛汗那里，对她说：“为什么我们柯族妇女生的许多孩子不能活下来？”布尔玛汗回答说：“那是‘胡大’〔一〕安排好的，谁能知道呢。”萨代提又反问她：“维族和俄罗斯族的小孩那么多，又为什么呀！”布尔玛汗给问得发窘了，低下头来。她想起自己生孩子时所受的痛苦。布尔玛汗沉痛地说：“谁也骇怕生孩子呀，但是有什么办法呢？前几天我和夏提帕提谈过呢，曾难过了半天。你知道她以前曾生过三、四个孩子，但一生下来就死去了。我的病就是在生孩子时得的呀！”萨代提觉得布尔玛汗的思想有了转变，就把新接生法告诉给她，并肯定地对她说：“如用新法接生，可以保证母亲和婴儿的安全。”布尔玛汗听后说：“你说的对，旧方法不能再用了。柯族的人愈来愈少了，活的没有死的多，年老的倒比孩子多。我可以去找夏提帕提，让她也去找你。你给她讲一讲新接生法。她大概又怀上小孩了。”通过布尔玛汗、夏提帕提等人的宣传教育，找萨代提的妇女渐渐多了。甚至在一次全乡妇女大会上，很多妇女要求她讲新接生法。她跑上台对妇女们说：“姊妹们，我们要实行新接生法，但是，有人说那会破坏我们祖先留下来的习惯。想一想看，这个旧习惯给我们妇女带来多么深重的灾难呀！那一位母亲在生育中没有得过重病？谁家没有死过婴儿。要是再这样下去，我们柯族就要绝根了！我们要用新接生法，来保证母亲、婴儿生命的安全，使柯族人口旺盛！”经过萨代提的不断努力，柯族妇女逐渐相信了新接生法。
    现在，人们都离不开萨代提了。在她的帐房里，经常有人请教她，有的是来请她去接生的，有的是请她检查胎位的，有的请她讲解怀孕时期应注意的事项。
    有一次夏提帕提跑来对萨代提说：“我怀孕后心里非常骇怕，这次怕活不成了。”萨代提安慰她说：“不要骇怕，用新法接生可保证孩子没有危险，就是难产也有办法。但是，你要注意不要做重活，要吃适口的东西，要穿宽大的衣服。”还告诉她要预先准备一些干净的羊毛，用水煮过，再准备一些新布，以便在生产时用。这样，夏提帕提就安心下来了。
    卡拉麻哈帕也骑着马来了。他慌张地对萨代提说：“诚心地请求你，帮助我一次吧！我的女人莎丽经过十多天，孩子还没有生下来，莎丽的血都快流完了。”卡拉麻哈帕焦急的眼睛里含着眼泪。萨代提拿起头巾来说：“走吧，看一看我是否能想出办法来。”她走到卡拉麻哈帕家，见莎丽正用双手抓着绳子，脸上被折磨得像白纸一样，两只眼睛已经陷到眼窝里去了。邻人束手无策地围在她的周围。萨代提连忙把产妇扶住，要她躺下来。经检查以后，她发现胎位是横着的。萨代提对这种情况也感到了棘手，就马上把产妇送到医院里。
    当萨代提陪着莎丽，抱着新生的婴儿回来的时候，柯族同胞都笑了，有人半开玩笑地说：“如果不是萨代提，卡拉麻哈帕或许成了光棍汉了。”卡拉麻哈帕高兴地紧握着萨代提的手，说：“诚心地感谢你，你救了莎丽和我的孩子，为了庆祝你的胜利，我要拿出一只刁羊〔二〕。”
    木萨的女人名叫古尔逊汗，今年二十一岁，她是第一次怀小孩。有一天她在挤马奶的时候，被马撞了一下，肚子就疼起来了。木萨本来要去请萨代提来帮助，可是她的妈妈斯牙特是一个守旧的女人，不让她去。木萨就偷偷地跑到萨代提那里，把萨代提请来了。萨代提帮助她把胎位扶正，并用布把产妇的肚子兜起来。
    正如俗话所说“撒下种子就有收获”，萨代提的力量没有白费，推广新法接生的工作在群众中开展起来了。
  〔一〕“胡大”即“老天爷”的意思。
  〔二〕“刁羊”是牧民逢喜事时作的一种游戏。作法：作喜事的人拿出一只山羊（不能是绵羊），割去羊头，由牧民骑着马争夺，最后谁把羊拿到手谁就算胜利；胜利者往往是那些骑术好而有力气的人，而且马也是最好的。参加这种游戏的人数不等，有时是数十人，有时数百人。（附图片）
