Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 9th: As the struggle against large-scale layoffs by Japanese coal industry monopoly capitalists intensifies, the Japanese Coal Miners' Union held its Eighth Extraordinary National Congress in Tokyo from September 1st to 6th. Approximately 170 representatives from the union's affiliated employee unions participated in the congress. The congress enthusiastically discussed the issue of unified struggle action and passed resolutions on opposing layoffs and demanding wage increases.

    The congress overwhelmingly adopted the Japanese Coal Miners' Union headquarters' struggle policy of opposing layoffs, deciding to use the unified struggle of the Japanese Coal Miners' Union to oppose the "enterprise rationalization" of implementing large-scale layoffs. The congress also established a central struggle committee to unify the coal miners' struggle actions and combine the anti-layoff struggle with the demand for wage increases, under the unified command of the central struggle committee. The congress also exposed the capitalists' conspiracy of so-called "voluntary resignation" as a disguised layoff.

    On the issue of demanding wage increases, the congress decided to demand that the capitalists implement an eight-hour work system and reasonably adjust wages.

    In order to strengthen the fight back against the layoffs that capitalists are carrying out in various coal mines, the congress decided that in addition to holding mass meetings in mines across the country, a six-hour strike will be held on September 17th.

    日本煤矿工会决定加强反对解雇的斗争
    【新华社九日讯】东京消息：正当反对日本煤业垄断资本家实行大规模解雇的斗争剧烈进行的时候，日本煤矿工会于九月一日到六日在东京举行了第八次临时全国大会。参加这次大会的有该工会所属各会员工会的代表约一百七十人。大会热烈地讨论了统一斗争行动问题，并作出了关于反对解雇、要求提高工资等决议。
    大会以绝对多数通过了日本煤矿工会总部提出的反对解雇的斗争方针，决定以日本煤矿工会的统一斗争来反对实行大规模解雇的“企业合理化”。大会并设立了一个中央斗争委员会，以统一煤矿工人的斗争行动，并把反对解雇斗争和要求提高工资的斗争结合起来，由中央斗争委员会统一指挥。大会还揭露了资方所谓“自愿退职”的变相解雇的阴谋。
    在要求增加工资的问题上，大会决定要求资方实行八小时工作制，并合理调整工资。
    为了加强反击资本家正在各煤矿进行的解雇，大会决定除了在全国各矿山举行群众大会外，并订于九月十七日举行六小时的罢工。
