Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 21st: At 4:30 PM on the 20th, two more captured personnel from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and one captured personnel from the Korean People's Army were sent back to our side by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. After these three captured personnel arrived at Panmunjom, they immediately held a press conference, exposing the crimes of the U.S. side assisting the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee bandit gangs in forcibly detaining prisoners of war.

At the press conference, Liu Shuanggui, a captured personnel from the Volunteer Army, took out a package of items brought back from the U.S. prisoner-of-war camp to show the reporters. Inside were letters distributed to the prisoners of war by the so-called delegation dispatched by the Chiang bandits, led by special agent chief Fang Zhi, a month earlier. These letters threatened them not to request repatriation, contained insulting items, and newly printed intimidating proclamations personally signed by the Chiang bandit, Kai-shek. Liu Shuanggui pointed at these items indignantly and said: "This is the evidence of U.S. imperialism supporting and assisting the Chiang bandit special agents in forcibly detaining Volunteer Army prisoners of war." Liu Shuanggui also pulled open his shirt to show everyone the flags and slogans of the Chiang bandit gang forcibly tattooed on his body.

Liu Shuanggui revealed the situation where the U.S. side forced prisoners of war to use false names and tear up prisoner-of-war cards, saying: "In the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission camp, I was forced to change my name to Luo Shangui. This was a name the Chiang bandit special agents forced me to change on September 13th, when we were about to leave Jeju Island for the demilitarized zone. On that day, the Chiang bandit special agents announced our respective false names to 500 Volunteer Army prisoners of war in our battalion area and coerced us to use only false names after arriving at the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission camp. At the same time, on our way to the demilitarized zone, the Chiang bandit special agents forced us to tear up our prisoner-of-war cards and threatened us, saying: 'Whoever refuses to tear them up is a communist and will be killed.'"

The U.S. side's conspiracy was obviously to prevent Indian troops from verifying the identities of the prisoners of war so that more Chiang bandit special agents could sneak into the camp disguised as prisoners of war.

Then, another Volunteer Army captured personnel, Wang Shixin, revealed: "On the 19th, when we arrived near the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission camp, we also saw four Chiang bandit special agents who had been sent from Taiwan to the first detachment of the third prisoner-of-war camp on Jeju Island in June of this year, mixed in with the prisoners of war, preparing to sneak into the camp."

Liu Shuanggui also revealed: "After the armistice, the U.S. military authorities gave each Chiang bandit special agent a very sharp Western-style dining knife. Now, the Chiang bandit special agents have taken these knives with them into the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission camp. They are openly threatening prisoners of war with these knives, saying: 'Whoever dares to ask to return to the mainland will be killed.'"

Liu Shuanggui and others revealed the serious crimes of the U.S. military authorities supporting and assisting the Chiang-Rhee special agents in forcibly detaining prisoners of war, making the U.S. reporters present, who were used to spreading rumors, very embarrassed and panicked. A U.S. reporter tried to confuse right and wrong and maliciously asked Liu Shuanggui: "Several thousand people have been repatriated in the past, why didn't you get repatriated with them?"

Liu Shuanggui replied angrily and loudly: "Don't you understand? The Americans want to forcibly detain us. Anyone who says they want to return home will be killed!" He also cited many facts to prove that the U.S. military authorities arbitrarily slaughtered prisoners of war who requested to return to their country. For example, last May, three Chinese People's Volunteer Army captured personnel were buried alive in gasoline drums by Chiang bandit special agents for requesting to return to their motherland, and another six Volunteer Army captured personnel were strangled to death with electric wires by Chiang bandit special agents.

Faced with these facts, the U.S. reporters were even more embarrassed and exposed their awkwardness, and had to slip away one by one in silence.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 21st: Today, another captured personnel from the Korean People's Army suddenly threw away the hat with the Rhee bandit's Taegeuk flag and the flag in his hand during the handover to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. He rushed out of the ranks controlled by special agents, requested repatriation, and waved and shouted to the Korean-Chinese observation representatives. According to news released by the Indian custodial forces, another Volunteer Army captured personnel also requested repatriation today.

Today's handover situation proves that the U.S. side directly intimidated the prisoners of war at the last minute before handing them over to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. Reporters saw U.S. handover personnel standing near the barbed wire watching the Volunteer Army captured personnel walking past them. If anyone did not shout reactionary slogans, they would stare at him with a fierce look. When a U.S. military personnel saw a Volunteer Army captured personnel holding the image of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit upside down, he openly kicked the Volunteer Army captured personnel. Another U.S. military personnel gestured to someone mixed in with the Volunteer Army captured personnel. This person, with a menacing look, was holding a wooden stick with an iron fork and was driving a group of Volunteer Army captured personnel into the camp.

The Volunteer Army captured personnel entering the camp today, like the previous days, did not have name and number cards. Their cards were forcibly torn up by the special agents on the way to the camp. This masked the fact that a large number of special agents were mixed into the prisoner-of-war camp, making the camp guarded by the Indian troops still shrouded in an atmosphere of terror, just like the prisoner-of-war camps on Geoje Island and Jeju Island. Reporters saw that the long flagpoles inserted into the camp by the special agents a few days ago had become very short today, and a special agent was holding the other half of the colored flagpole as a wooden stick, beating a captured personnel. Nearby, a group of people were sparsely shouting reactionary slogans. It looked like this captured personnel was beaten for not shouting slogans. After a group of Volunteer Army captured personnel entered the camp, a dozen people holding wooden sticks forced them to come out of the tents to gather and reorganize.

    我方被俘人员三名突破特务控制遣返归来
    二十一日又有两名我方被俘人员要求遣返
    【新华社开城二十一日电】二十日下午四时半，又有两名中国人民志愿军被俘人员和一名朝鲜人民军被俘人员由中立国遣返委员会遣送给我方。这三个我方被俘人员到达板门店以后，立即举行了记者招待会，揭露美方协助蒋介石和李承晚匪帮特务强迫扣留战俘的罪行。
    在招待会上，志愿军被俘人员刘双贵拿出一包从美方战俘营带回来的东西给记者们看。这里面包着一个月以前蒋匪派遣的由特务头子方治率领的所谓代表团分发给战俘的恫吓他们不得要求遣返的信件、侮辱性的物品和新印的蒋匪介石亲笔签署的恐吓文告等。刘双贵愤激地指着这些东西说：“这就是美帝国主义支持和协助蒋匪特务强迫扣留志愿军被俘人员的罪证。”刘双贵还拉开上衣，给大家看他身上被强迫刺上的蒋匪帮的旗帜和口号。
    刘双贵揭露美方强迫战俘使用假名字和撕毁战俘卡片的情形说：“在中立国看管营地内，我被强迫改名为罗山贵。这是在九月十三日我们即将离开济州岛到非军事区来的时候，蒋匪特务强迫我改的一个名字。当天，蒋匪特务向我们一个营场内的五百名志愿军被俘人员宣布了我们各人的假名字，并且胁迫我们到达中立国看管营地以后一律要用假名字。同时，在我们到非军事区来的途中，蒋匪特务又强迫我们把战俘卡片撕毁，并且恫吓我们说：‘谁不愿意撕掉就是共产党，就要杀死他。’”
    美方的这个阴谋，显然是为了使印度部队无法验明战俘的身份，以便更多的蒋匪特务得以混在战俘中间潜入营场去。
    接着，另一个志愿军被俘人员王士信揭露说：“十九日，我们到达中立国看管营地附近时，还看到四个在今年六月间从台湾派到济州岛第三战俘营第一联队的蒋匪特务混在战俘中间，准备潜入营场去。”
    刘双贵还揭露说：“停战以后，美军当局曾发给蒋匪特务每人一把非常锋利的吃西餐用的刀子。现在，蒋匪特务已带着这些刀子混进了中立国看管营地。他们拿着这些刀子公开威胁战俘说：‘谁敢要求回大陆，就杀死谁。’”
    刘双贵等揭露美军当局支持和协助蒋李特务强迫扣留战俘的严重罪行，使得在场的惯会造谣的美方记者们十分狼狈和惊慌。一个美方记者企图混淆是非，恶意地问刘双贵道：“过去有几千个人被遣返，你为什么没有和他们一起遣返？”
    刘双贵愤怒地大声回答道：“你还不明白吗？美国人要强迫扣留我们。谁说要回国，就要被杀死！”他还列举了许多事实证明美军当局恣意屠杀要求遣返回国的战俘。例如，去年五月，有三个中国人民志愿军被俘人员因为要求返回祖国，被蒋匪特务装在汽油桶里活埋，另外六个志愿军被俘人员被蒋匪特务用电线勒死。
    在这些事实面前，美方记者们更加狼狈，窘态毕露，只得一个个不声不响地溜走了。
    【新华社开城二十一日电】今天又有一名朝鲜人民军被俘人员在移交给中立国看管过程中，突然扔掉了有李匪太极旗的帽子和手上拿的旗子，从特务控制的行列里冲出来，要求遣返，并向朝中观察代表招手高呼。另据印度看管部队方面发布的消息说，今天还有一名志愿军被俘人员也要求遣返。
    今日交接的情况证明，美方在把战俘交给中立国看管的最后一分钟还直接对战俘进行恐吓。记者看到美方的遣交人员站在铁丝网附近看着从他们身边走过的志愿军被俘人员，谁要是没有喊反动口号，他们就用一种凶恶的目光盯着他。有一个美军人员在看到一个志愿军被俘人员倒拿着蒋介石匪首的像时，竟公然用脚踢那个志愿军被俘人员。另一个美军人员则向混杂在志愿军被俘人员中的一个人打手势。这个人气势汹汹地拿着一根带铁叉的木棍，正驱赶着一批志愿军被俘人员进入营场。
    今天进入营场的志愿军被俘人员还是像前几天一样，没有姓名和编号的卡片，他们的卡片在来营场的途中被特务强迫着撕毁了。这样掩护了大批特务分子混入战俘营场，使得在印度部队看管的营场里，仍然像巨济岛、济州岛战俘营一样地笼罩着恐怖的气氛。记者看到前几天特务们插在营场里的长长的旗杆，今天变得很短了，而一个特务手里正拿着那半截彩色旗杆当作木棒，在殴打一个被俘人员，旁边则有一群人在疏疏落落地喊着反动口号。看样子，这个被俘人员是因为没有喊口号而被打的。有一批志愿军被俘人员刚进入营场后，就有十几个手持木棍的人强迫他们从帐篷里出来集合重新编队。
