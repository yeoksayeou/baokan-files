    Two Solid Alkali Pots Manufactured by Benxi Coal and Iron Company Mechanical Repair Factory are of Poor Quality
    A letter from the Basic Construction Section of Tianjin Chemical Plant: Our plant ordered two large solid alkali pots from Benxi Coal and Iron Company Mechanical Repair Factory in July of last year. The contract stipulated that the quality should be qualified as having no watermarks and no sand holes. When the goods were delivered at the end of January this year, we sent people to the site for inspection. At that time, due to weather conditions, water testing was not possible, and the outer skin of the pot was covered with a layer of sand, dust, and iron powder, so only one hard scar was found on one pot. After the two pots were transported back to the factory, one of them was installed and used first. However, during the first use, we discovered that the pot had as many sand holes as a honeycomb, with some as deep as an inch. The other pot has not dared to be used to this day. After we telegraphed the factory to send someone to inspect it, the situation was proven to be true; however, the factory adopted the attitude of "once inspected and accepted, we are not responsible after delivery." We believe that it is wrong for state-owned factories to be so irresponsible for product quality.
    Due to the poor quality of these two pots, the completion of our factory's production tasks has been seriously affected. We request that the factory quickly take effective remedial measures to solve this problem.

    本溪煤铁公司机械修配厂制造的两口固碱锅质量不好
    天津化工厂基本建设科来信：我厂在去年七月向本溪煤铁公司机械修配厂订购固碱大锅两口，合同规定质量以无水纹、无砂眼为合格。今年一月底交货时，我们派人到现场验收。当时因气候关系不能试水，且大锅外皮浮盖一层砂灰和铁粉，所以仅检查出一口锅有硬疤一处。这两口锅运回厂后，其中一口先行安装使用。但在第一次使用时我们就发现锅中砂眼多如蜂窝，深的达一寸许。另一口锅因而至今未敢使用。经我们电催该厂派人来检验，证明情况属实；但该厂却采取了“既经验收，出门不管”的态度。国营工厂这样对产品质量不负责任，我们认为是错误的。
    由于这两口锅的质量不好，严重影响了我厂生产任务的完成。我们要求该厂迅速采取有效的补救办法来解决这个问题。
