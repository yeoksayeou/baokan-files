    Pay Attention to Promoting Early Maturity of Cotton to Increase Cotton Yield

    In July and August this year, continuous rain fell in North China, Northeast China, and Henan and Shandong provinces. The temperature was low, and there was little sunshine, resulting in excessive cotton plant growth and a large number of boll shedding and rotting. Currently, most cotton fields in these areas are still damp. The cotton maturity period in these areas will generally be delayed compared to previous years, and yields may be lower than last year. Frost-damaged cotton will increase, and autumn plowing of cotton fields will inevitably be affected. Therefore, making efforts to promote early maturity of cotton, increasing cotton harvest volume and quality, and ensuring that cotton fields can be autumn-plowed around the Beginning of Winter (立冬), has become a major task in cotton-producing areas.

    On September 5th and 12th, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government issued circulars on strengthening cotton field management, promoting early maturity of cotton, and striving for more harvests, putting forward a number of specific technical measures. Cadres at all levels in cotton-producing areas should pay close attention to these measures and promote them.

    In the past, near the harvest season, cotton fields were no longer cultivated, only waiting for cotton picking. Therefore, when promoting cultivation methods to promote early maturity of cotton and strive for more harvests, we must overcome the erroneous thinking of some cadres and the masses that cotton harvest is already a foregone conclusion and no more cultivation methods can be used to strive for more harvests; at the same time, we should pay special attention to strengthening technical guidance to avoid causing losses to cotton due to improper implementation of these methods.

    The best way to overcome the ideological concerns of the masses and avoid possible mistakes is to first select certain locations to set a good example. This time, the Central Ministry of Agriculture sent people to discuss with farmers in Xiaojie Village, Xiaogaozhuang, and Sihezhuang in Tong County, Hebei Province, and conducted field experiments to make farmers realize that these methods are indeed feasible and effective; at the same time, they also educated farmers by calculating detailed accounts, which is a very good practice. Last year, Xiaojie Village in Tong County had early frost around the Cold Dew (寒露) solar term and only picked cotton twice. This year, if hoeing and sunning the cotton plants are carried out, cotton can be picked three times by the Cold Dew solar term, and it is estimated that each mu can yield 20 more jin of white cotton; once calculated in this way, farmers are willing to actively implement these methods. All localities can follow this approach and study feasible methods with local farmers.

    Currently, it is a busy season for autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn planting. If we want to increase cotton field cultivation management work, there will be some difficulties in the allocation of farmers' labor, but this difficulty can also be overcome. The farmers in Xiaojie Village and other places in Tong County, after practically experimenting with hoeing and sunning the cotton plants, are prepared to immediately allocate manpower to carry out these tasks after carrying out the intense harvesting work, which solves the problem. At present, some areas in Northeast China and Inner Mongolia have already experienced early frost, and early frost may also arrive earlier in North China, Henan, and Shandong this year. Cadres in all cotton-producing areas should actively mobilize the masses and use various methods to advance cotton maturity in order to strive for higher cotton yield and quality!

    注意促进棉花早熟提高棉花产量
    今年七、八月间，华北、东北及河南、山东等地霪雨连绵，气温低、日照少，棉株疯长，落铃烂铃很多，目前这些地区的大部棉田仍然阴湿。这些地区棉花成熟期一般要比往年推迟，产量可能比去年减少，霜黄花将要增多，棉田秋耕也势必受到影响。因此，努力促进棉花早熟，提高棉花的收获量和质量，并保证棉田能够在立冬前后进行秋耕，已成为当前棉区的一项主要工作。
    九月五日和十二日中央人民政府农业部曾先后发出了关于加强棉田管理、促进棉花早熟、力争多收的通报，提出了若干具体技术措施。棉区各级干部对这些措施应十分重视，加以推行。
    以往临近收获季节，棉田即不再进行任何耕作，只待摘收棉花。因此，目前在推行促进棉花早熟力争多收的耕作方法时，必须克服某些干部和群众认为棉花收成已成定局，不能再用任何耕作方法争取多收的错误思想；同时应特别注意加强技术指导，以免因为不正确地推行这些办法反而使棉花遭受损失。
    要克服群众的思想顾虑并避免可能发生的错误，最好的办法是先选择一定的地点作好样子。这次中央农业部派人和河北省通县小街村、小高庄、四合庄的农民座谈，并进行田间实地试验，使农民认识这些办法确实可行和有效；同时，还用算细账的方法向农民进行教育，这个做法很好。去年通县小街村寒露节前后早降寒霜，只摘了两次棉花，今年如进行锄耪和推株晒地，到寒露节即可摘三次棉花，估计每亩可多收二十斤白花；这样一算，农民就愿意积极地实行这些办法了。各地可以仿照这个做法，和当地农民研究可行的办法。
    目前正是秋收、秋耕、秋种繁忙的季节，要想增加棉田耕作管理工作，在农民的劳力调配上一定会有些困难，但这个困难也是可以克服的。通县小街村等地的农民，实地试验过锄耪和推株晒地的办法后，准备在进行紧张的收割工作以后，立即分出人力来进行这些工作，这就解决了困难问题。目前东北、内蒙古有些地区已降初霜，华北地区和河南、山东等地今年初霜也可能提早到来，各棉区干部应积极地发动群众，运用各种提早棉花成熟的办法，为提高棉花产量和质量而斗争！
