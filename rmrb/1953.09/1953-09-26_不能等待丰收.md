Newspaper Review:

    Cannot Wait for a Bumper Harvest
    Since August 25th, the Heilongjiang Daily has continuously promoted frost prevention and production protection. There has been a lot of rain and little sunshine in Heilongjiang Province this year, making it difficult for crops to ripen early. The province's autumn harvest will begin in late September, but Nenjiang District 6 experienced early frost on August 22nd, which may cause frost damage and reduced production. The Heilongjiang Daily seized the opportunity to mobilize the broad masses of farmers to fight against frost damage and actively strive for early ripening and a bumper harvest, which will greatly contribute to this year's increased grain production in the province.
    The main obstacle to frost prevention and production protection work is the negative attitude towards frost prevention among cadres and the masses. The Heilongjiang Daily has been reporting on overcoming these negative ideas. The two main negative ideas exposed by the newspaper are: one is that the ground is wet this year, so the frost will definitely come late, and it doesn't matter if the crops are still green; the other is that frost is a natural disaster, there is no way to prevent it, so we have to let it be. The Heilongjiang Daily made powerful criticisms of these ideas in two short commentaries on August 25th and September 10th. On the one hand, the short commentaries pointed out, based on scientific principles and examples of early frost, that this year's abundant rain and wet ground will inevitably lead to cold soil and low temperatures, and the frost will definitely come early, so there must be no carelessness. On the other hand, it reminded those who were panicked and lost confidence: it is not terrible that crops may suffer frost damage if they are still green; what is terrible is our ideological paralysis or lack of confidence. If we earnestly summarize and promote the various frost prevention experiences inherent among the farmers, rely on the foundation of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and unite and mobilize the masses to take frost prevention as a major task to ensure increased production, frost damage can be avoided. The newspaper's criticism and education aimed at the ideological problems of the masses, and its specific analysis of the various favorable conditions in practical work, pointed out the direction of work for the masses.
    The Heilongjiang Daily also paid attention to using the activities of the masses themselves to explain working methods to the masses. On August 25th, the newspaper reported on the news that "Liu Zhendong (mutual aid) group in Hailun District 14 is actively preventing crops from turning green." Li Guangyi, the technical team leader of the mutual aid group, proposed at the group meeting: "This year there is a lot of rain, we cannot wait for a bumper harvest, we must actively strive for a bumper harvest." He suggested dividing the work to promote early ripening of crops. His opinion was supported by the entire group, and after the meeting, the entire group immediately divided the twenty male and female laborers into different tasks. Eight male laborers threshed wheat and did odd jobs; four male laborers and eight female laborers released corn and sorghum from autumn ridges; bundled corn and sorghum stalks and bottom leaves, pinched soybean tips and corn amaranth, and removed large weeds to promote early ripening and prevent frost. The working method published in the newspaper quickly attracted the attention of other mutual aid groups. The news "Hailun Xu Guochen Mutual Aid Group Rationally Allocates Labor to Strive for Early Ripening of Crops" on September 5th said that the members of the Xu Guochen Mutual Aid Group read the frost prevention and production protection news and short commentary in the August 25th newspaper several times at the group meeting, and everyone unanimously realized that: "If we don't find a way to strive for early ripening of crops, we will reduce the harvest." They immediately divided the work according to the Liu Zhendong Mutual Aid Group, and started working separately the next day. Another effective method of preventing frost damage is to light fires and create smoke, using the smoke screen to prevent the ground's heat from dissipating and protect crops from frost. The Heilongjiang Daily introduced in detail on September 1st and 5th the local farmers' experience in promoting early ripening of crops and creating smoke, which was summarized by the Keshan Agricultural Experiment Station by going deep into the countryside, and then reported on the specific practices and effects of the masses using smoke to prevent frost. A report on September 10th said: The party committees of Qinggang, Yian and other counties led the entire county in mass frost prevention work. Xinxing Village in Qinggang District 6 ensured that people and animals were not idle, pulling and carrying firewood to the edge of the field, using drums, gongs, and firecrackers as signals to light fires and create smoke to prevent frost. More than 200 people in Kesuli Village in Suiling District 4 went to the fields to light fires and release smoke. The next day, after the masses went to the fields to check, they said: "It really works. The soybeans near the fire have green branches and leaves, and the soybean leaves far from the fire are red." Obviously, the newspaper's publicity through these real people and real events has given the masses a model to learn from. And the various activities of the broad masses actively striving for a bumper harvest, not waiting for a bumper harvest, which are propagated in the reports, are specific and vivid ideological education for the masses on "man will conquer nature," which will inevitably become a material force to promote the early ripening and bumper harvest of crops in the province this year.

    不能等待丰收
    自八月二十五日起到最近，黑龙江日报连续进行了防霜保产的宣传。黑龙江省今年的雨水多、日照少，庄稼贪青不易早熟。该省秋收将自九月下旬开始，但嫩江六区八月二十二日已降早霜，有遭受霜害减产的可能。黑龙江日报抓紧时机动员广大农民和霜害进行斗争，积极争取早熟丰收，这对今年该省的粮食增产是有很大作用的。
    防霜保产工作的主要障碍，是干部和群众中间对防霜的消极思想。黑龙江日报即从克服这些消极思想入手进行了报道。报纸揭露的两种主要消极思想是：一种认为今年地湿，霜来的一定晚，庄稼贪青不要紧；另一种认为霜是自然灾害，没有办法预防，只好由它罢了。黑龙江日报在八月二十五日、九月十日的两个短评中，针对这种思想进行了有力的批判。短评一方面根据科学道理和已发生早霜的例子，指出今年雨多地湿，一定会土冷气温低，霜来的必然早，因此决不能麻痹大意。一方面又提醒那些惊惶失措失去信心的人说：庄稼贪青有遭受霜害的可能并不可怕，可怕的倒是我们思想上的麻痹大意，或者没有信心。如果我们认真总结和推广农民中间固有的各种防霜经验，依靠互助合作运动的基础，团结发动群众把防霜当作保证增产的大事担当起来，霜害是可以避免的。报纸针对群众的思想问题进行批判教育，并对实际工作中的各种有利条件作出具体的分析，这就为群众指明了工作的方向。
    黑龙江日报还注意通过群众自己的活动，来向群众交代工作方法。八月二十五日该报报道了海伦十四区“刘振东（互助）组积极预防庄稼贪青”的消息。互助组的技术组长李广义在小组会上提出：“今年雨水大，咱们不能等待丰收，一定要积极争取丰收。”他建议分工进行促使庄稼早熟的工作。他的意见得到全组的拥护，会后全组立刻将二十名男女劳动力分了工。八名男劳动力打小麦、干零活；四名男劳动力和八名女劳动力放包米、高粱秋垅；打包米、高粱丫子和底叶子，掐大豆尖和包米蓼，拿大草，促使早熟防霜。报纸上登出的这个工作方法很快就受到别的互助组的注意。九月五日的“海伦徐国臣互助组合理调配劳动力争取庄稼早熟”的消息中说，徐国臣互助组的组员在小组会上把八月二十五日报纸上的防霜保产消息和短评读了几遍，大家一致认识到：“不想办法争取庄稼早熟，就要减少收成。”他们当即按照刘振东互助组那样进行了分工，第二天就分头干了起来。防霜害的另一种有效办法是拢火熏烟，用烟幕使地面的热不易散发，保护庄稼免受霜冻。黑龙江日报在九月一日、五日详细介绍了克山农业试验场深入农村所总结的当地农民促使庄稼早熟和熏烟的经验，接着又报道了群众使用熏烟防霜的具体作法和效果。九月十日的一篇报道中说：青岗、依安等县党委领导全县进行了群众性的防霜工作。青岗六区新兴村做到人马不闲，拉的拉、扛的扛，往地边送柴火，以打鼓、敲锣、放洋炮为令，一齐点火熏烟防霜。绥棱县四区克苏里村有二百多人都到地里去拢火放烟。第二天群众到地里看过后说：“真有效果，离火近的大豆，青枝绿叶的；离火远的，大豆叶发红了。”显然，报纸通过这些真人真事的宣传，就使群众有了学习的榜样。而报道中所传播的广大群众积极争取丰收、不是等待丰收的种种活动，就是向群众进行“人定胜天”的具体生动的思想教育，这又必然会成为推动今年该省庄稼早熟丰收的一种物质力量。
