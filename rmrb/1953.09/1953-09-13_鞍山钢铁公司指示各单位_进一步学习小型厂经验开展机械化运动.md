Anshan Iron and Steel Company Instructs All Units
Further Learn from the Experience of Small Factories and Launch a Mechanization Movement
Since Anshan Iron and Steel Company promoted the experience of the mechanization and automation movement in small factories, all units have achieved considerable results. Recently, the company determined necessary measures to instruct all units to further carry out the mechanization and automation movement.

Since the Anshan Municipal Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Anshan Iron and Steel Company promoted the experience of the mechanization and automation movement in small factories in January of this year, all units of Anshan Iron and Steel have made achievements. The entire company (production and capital construction) has reviewed and adopted 468 mechanization and automation proposals, of which 290 have been put into production, and the rest are under construction or research. According to the statistics of 51 successful proposals whose value can be calculated, they can create 96.6 billion yuan of wealth for the country in one year; 62 proposals have freed 855 people from high-temperature operations and heavy physical labor; 66 proposals have saved 538 people, and these proposals have played a significant role in increasing production, improving quality, ensuring safe production, and improving working conditions. In the past six months, the units with better performance are small factories, steel rope factories, power plants, chemical plants, medium-sized factories, metal products factories, and the engineering team of the machinery department.

However, some leading cadres in some units still have incorrect understandings: some are waiting for a thorough transformation and replacement of new equipment in the future, waiting for capital construction, and adopting a passive attitude towards the reform of current technical equipment; some mistakenly emphasize that the movement will affect production and that there is no construction force, opposing technical reform to current production; some do not realize that this is a long-term and regular task, fantasizing about solving all problems in a short period of time through a sudden campaign, and failing to arrange it in a planned manner; some even believe that the mechanization and automation level of their units is already very high and there is nothing to improve. These incorrect understandings affect the smooth development of the mechanization and automation movement.

In order to further carry out the mechanization and automation movement, the company has made the following decisions:

(1) It is necessary to earnestly learn from the experience of small factories. All units must organize cadres above the workshop (pit mouth) and engineering and technical personnel to earnestly study the documents. Make every cadre fully aware of the great significance of gradually implementing mechanization and automation based on existing equipment conditions and carrying out technical transformation of old enterprises, and criticize some incorrect understandings; require leading cadres at all levels to be familiar with the specific experience of small factories and implement it in their work.

(2) Strengthen the leadership of rationalization proposals and extensively absorb workers to participate in rationalization proposals. The Rationalization Proposal Committee is the organizer for uniting the broad masses of workers to participate in the movement. The administration should cooperate with the Rationalization Proposal Committee to formulate topics based on the key issues in production in each period, organize workers to put forward suggestions around the topics, and solve these key issues. Deputy factory (mine) directors in charge of production and chief engineers must be fully responsible for the review, adoption, and organization of the implementation of rationalization proposals, and report regularly to the Rationalization Proposal Committee. Administrative departments at all levels should assist the trade union in rectifying the Rationalization Proposal Committee, absorb activists and advanced producers in the mechanization and automation movement, and establish necessary working systems so that it can better undertake this task.

(3) The focus of the mechanization and automation movement should be on: harsh working environments, unsafe, unsanitary, heavy physical labor, and manual operations. It should be planned to overcome the weak links in production and solve the problem of uneven production capacity. The mechanization and automation movement must be combined with the factory's transformation policy and carried out without hindering the overall design principles. In order to obtain the greatest increase in production with the least investment and to save national investment, suggestions that do not cost much money but have great results must be realized first.

(4) Major technical reforms are often difficult to succeed by relying on one person's wisdom. It is necessary to give full play to the collective creativity and advocate cooperation between technical personnel and workers. The experience of small factories tells us that organizing active mechanization proposers, experienced veteran technicians who are familiar with the characteristics of production operations and equipment, and active technical personnel around the topic, mobilizing everyone to use their brains to help each other and learn from each other's strengths to make up for their weaknesses, can make each creation quickly successful. It is also necessary to do a good job in political and ideological work, overcome the thoughts of jealousy of others' success and the old habits of "holding back" that exist in individual workers; overcome the outdated views of a few engineering and technical personnel, as well as the erroneous thoughts of being ambitious and unrealistic; promptly commend advanced figures and advanced thoughts, and establish a collectivistic and pragmatic work style in order to promote the development of the movement.

(5) Earnestly learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, advocate reading more Soviet books, newspapers, magazines, and publications, and absorb the experience of Soviet mechanization and automation. Actively learn from Soviet experts. For suggestions belonging to major production technology or equipment reform, consult Soviet experts more. It must be done like small factories to earnestly implement the suggestions of Soviet experts.

(6) Leaders should pay attention to vigorously cultivating people with advanced thinking and creative talents. Experience has proved that the movement will be better carried out in units that have established banners. All units must also reward effective suggestions in a timely manner, and appropriately adopt reward forms welcomed by the masses to mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses.

(7) Give full play to the potential of design and construction. For every mature suggestion, organize forces in a timely manner to carry out design and construction, and make it put into production as soon as possible to continuously improve the creative enthusiasm of the masses. All units should learn from the experience of small factories, organize the original proposers into the design and construction forces, so as to continuously improve the original suggestions during construction and achieve greater results.

(8) For mechanization and automation proposals that have been preliminarily reviewed and need further research and experimentation, the leadership should provide all convenience, and assist in solving the materials needed within the possible range, and do not refuse to support them because there is no plan. When necessary, it is allowed to approve the proposer to leave production for research and experimentation, and the salary during the research and experimentation period shall not be lower than the average salary of the previous three months. During the period of approved experiments on existing production equipment, the wage income of the operators participating in the experiment shall also not be lower than the average wage of the previous three months.

Finally, the company requires all units to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the mechanization and automation work and study and formulate plans for further development.

    鞍山钢铁公司指示各单位
    进一步学习小型厂经验开展机械化运动
    鞍山钢铁公司自推广小型厂机械化、自动化运动的经验以来，各单位已取得不少成绩。最近该公司又确定必要措施，指示各单位进一步开展机械化、自动化运动。
    今年一月中共鞍山市委、鞍山钢铁公司推广小型厂机械化、自动化运动的经验以来，鞍钢各单位已经取得了成绩。全公司（生产与基本建设）经过审查采纳的机械化、自动化建议有四百六十八件，其中已经参加生产的有二百九十件，其余正在施工或研究中。根据已经成功而可以计算价值的五十一件统计，一年可给国家创造九百六十六亿元的财富；有六十二件建议使八百五十五人摆脱了高温操作和重体力劳动；有六十六件节省了劳动力五百三十八人，这些建议对于提高产量、质量、保证安全生产、改善劳动条件起了很大的作用。半年来成绩较好的单位是小型厂、钢绳厂、发电厂、化工厂、中型厂、金属制品厂、和机械处的工程队等。
    但还有一些单位的领导干部存在着不正确的认识：有的坐待将来彻底改造更换新的设备，坐待基本建设施工，对当前的技术设备的改革采取消极态度；有的错误地强调运动会影响生产，强调没有施工力量，把技术改革同当前生产对立起来；有的没有认识到这是一个长期的经常工作，幻想在短时期内突击一下全部解决问题，未能有计划地进行安排；甚至有的认为本单位的机械化、自动化程度已经很高，没有什么可改进了。这些错误认识影响着机械化、自动化运动顺利开展。
    为进一步开展机械化、自动化运动，该公司特作如下决定：
    （一）必须认真学习小型厂的经验。各单位必须组织车间（坑口）、工段以上干部及工程技术人员认真学习文件。使每一个干部都能充分认识到根据现有设备条件，逐步实行机械化、自动化，对旧企业进行技术改造的重大意义，并对一些不正确的认识进行批判；要求各级领导干部必须熟悉小型厂的具体经验，把它贯彻到工作中去。
      （二）加强合理化建议工作的领导，广泛吸收职工参加合理化建议工作。合理化建议委员会是团结广大职工参加运动的组织者。行政应协同合理化建议委员会根据每一时期生产中的关键问题拟出课题，组织职工围绕课题提出建议，解决这些关键问题。生产副厂（矿）长、主任工程师必须对合理化建议的审查、采纳和组织实现全部负责，定期向合理化建议委员会作工作报告。各级行政应协助工会整顿合理化建议委员会，把机械化、自动化运动中的积极分子，先进生产者吸收进来，并建立必要的工作制度，使它能更好地担负起这一任务。
    （三）机械化、自动化运动的重点应该放在：劳动环境恶劣、不安全、不卫生、笨重的体力劳动、手工操作多的方面，应该有计划地克服生产上的薄弱环节，解决生产能力不均衡的问题。机械化、自动化运动必须与工厂的改造方针相结合，在不妨碍总体设计原则下进行。为了以最少的投资获得最大的增产效果，以节省国家投资，对那些花钱不多、效果很大的建议，必须首先使之实现。
   （四）重大的技术改革，依靠一个人的智慧往往是难于成功的，必须发挥集体创造精神，提倡技术人员与工人合作。小型厂的经验告诉我们，把积极的机械化建议者，有丰富经验、熟悉生产操作设备特性的老技术工人，和积极的技术人员围绕课题组织起来，发动大家开动脑筋互助互学，取长补短，才能使每件创造迅速成功。并必须做好政治思想工作，克服个别工人中存在的妒忌别人成功的思想和“留一手”的旧习气；克服少数工程技术人员的陈旧观点，以及好高骛远、眼高手低不务实际等错误思想；及时表扬先进人物与先进思想，树立集体主义与实事求是的思想作风，才能使运动开展起来。
    （五）认真学习苏联先进经验，提倡多看苏联书、报、杂志、刊物，吸取苏联机械化、自动化的经验。积极向苏联专家学习，属于重大的生产技术或设备改革的建议，应多多请教苏联专家，必须做到像小型厂那样认真贯彻苏联专家建议。
    （六）领导上应注意大力培养有先进思想和创造才能的人物。经验证明：凡是树立了旗帜的单位，运动就会更好地开展起来。各单位还必须对有效的建议及时进行奖励，并适当采用群众欢迎的奖励形式，把群众情绪鼓动起来。
    （七）充分发挥设计施工潜力。每一件成熟的建议，应及时组织力量进行设计施工，尽可能使之迅速投入生产，使群众创造热情不断提高。各单位应吸取小型厂的经验，把原建议人组织到设计施工力量里面来，以便在施工中不断改进原建议，而收得更大效果。
    （八）凡机械化、自动化建议经初步审查有进一步研究试验之必要者，领导上应给予一切便利条件，需要之材料在可能范围内必须协助解决，不要因为无计划就不给支领。在必要时得批准建议人脱离生产研究试验，在研究试验期间之工资不得低于前三个月的平均工资。经批准在已有的生产设备上进行试验期间，参加试验之操作人员的工资收入亦不得低于前三个月的平均工资。
    最后该公司要求各单位应将机械化、自动化工作进行一次全面检查，研究制订进一步开展的计划。
