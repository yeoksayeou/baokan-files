    The Sixth District Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Qionglai County Should Improve Its Work to Serve Production
    A letter from the Qionglai County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party: The agricultural production materials supply work of the Sixth District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Qionglai County, Sichuan Province, is done very poorly. During spring plowing production this year, the Sixth District Cooperative supplied very few farm tools, and the variety of farm tools was also "inconsistent." During the tense drought resistance period, the cooperative did not prepare a single waterwheel; some farm tools were not suitable for the needs of farmers, such as farmers needing sharp, full-mouthed plowshares, but the cooperative only had blunt, broken-mouthed plowshares. The price of nail rakes supplied by the cooperative was even more expensive than the market price, so farmers had to go to other places to buy them. In addition, the cooperative had promised its members to supply fertilizer in a timely manner, but later failed to supply it in the promised quantities, delaying farmers' production. Therefore, the local people are very dissatisfied with the cooperative.
    However, the director of the Sixth District Cooperative is indifferent to the above situation. He spends his days playing cards and sleeping, without thinking about how to accept the opinions of the masses, to improve his work, so that the cooperative can truly play a role in serving production. From March to the present, the cooperative has not held a single meeting of members' representatives or supervisors to solicit opinions from the masses. Before the autumn harvest, the cooperative also does not investigate the needs of farmers before and after the autumn harvest. Therefore, the sickles, bamboo baskets, hoes for smelting large fires, as well as raincoats, palm-fiber jackets, backpacks, and baskets needed by farmers to cut grass and accumulate fertilizer have been out of stock at the cooperative for a long time. Now that the autumn harvest has begun, the cooperative has finally prepared 50 drying mats, 300 sickles, 46 winnowing fans, and 14 mixing buckets, but these things are far from meeting the needs of local farmers. Now, the cooperatives in other districts of Qionglai County are bustling with people, but the Sixth District Cooperative is deserted even on market days. Such a cooperative needs to undergo a good work inspection and make concrete corrections.

### 邛崃县六区供销合作社应改进工作为生产服务

    邛崃县六区供销合作社应改进工作为生产服务
    中共邛崃县委会二周来信：四川省邛崃县六区供销合作社农业生产资料的供应工作做得太不好。今年春耕生产中，六区合作社供应农具的数量很少，农具品种也是“锣齐鼓不齐”。在抗旱紧张时，合作社没有准备一架水车；有些农具不适合农民的需要，如农民需要有尖的满口铧，但合作社只有没尖的差口铧。合作社供应的钉扒价格比市场上还贵，农民只好跑到其他地方去买。此外，该社曾向社员保证及时供应肥料，但后来却没有如数供应，耽误了农民的生产。因此，当地群众对合作社很不满意。
    但是，六区合作社主任对上述情况却毫不在乎。他成天玩扑克、睡大觉，而不想想怎样接受群众意见，来改进工作，使合作社真正能起为生产服务的作用。从三月份到现在，合作社还没开过一次社员代表会或监事会来征求群众意见，在秋收前，合作社也不调查农民秋收前后的需要。因此，农民们割草积肥需用的镰刀、筍?背、炼大火的锄头，以及蓑衣、棕褂子、背篓、箩筐等，合作社长期来都没有货。秋收开始了，合作社总算准备了晒罩五十床、镰刀三百把、簸箕四十六个、拌桶十四张，但这些东西远不能满足当地农民的需要。现在邛崃县别区的合作社来往的人是川流不息，但六区合作社就是在赶场日也是冷冷清清。像这样的合作社，都需要进行一次很好的工作检查，切实改正。
