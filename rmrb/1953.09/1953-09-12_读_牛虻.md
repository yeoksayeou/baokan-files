    Reading "The Gadfly"
    By Ethel Voynich, translated by Li Liangmin, published by China Youth Publishing House, July 1953
    Wei Junyi

    In the books "How the Steel Was Tempered" and "The Story of Zoya and Shura," it is mentioned that both Paul and Zoya loved to read "The Gadfly" and were educated by this book. Therefore, as soon as the Chinese translation of "The Gadfly" was published, it was eagerly read by the vast number of young readers. This book describes the heroic figures in the Italian national liberation movement more than a hundred years ago, and depicts the spiritual outlook of those patriots who shed their blood for the people in history. The political thoughts of the hero named Gadfly and his understanding of problems are different from those of the heroes of our era, but we respect them, just as we respect the heroes in our "Water Margin" or the heroes of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. They are our predecessors, and there are many things we can learn from them.

    "The Gadfly" reflects Italy in the 1830s and 1840s, precisely the era when Italy was subjected to Austrian oppression. Italy was divided into several small countries (including the Papal States), and the rulers of several small countries were relatives or lackeys of the Austrian royal family. The church was also an ally of Austria. Cruel oppression made the Italian people unbearable. After the Carbonari uprising in the 1820s, Mazzini, a petit-bourgeois democrat and revolutionary, founded the "Young Italy Party." The task they put forward was: "To revive Italy and make it a free, equal, and unified country, a unified, independent, and autonomous Italy." At the same time, some large landlords and bourgeois elements advocated the national reunification movement. They supported the Pope and advocated the establishment of an independent monarchical state. The Young Italy Party fought for the liberation of the motherland for twenty years, but Mazzini did not rely on the masses and mainly wanted to seize power through conspiracy. He repeatedly wrote letters appealing to the King of Piedmont (one of those small countries) and the Pope to rise up and lead the Italian national liberation movement. He placed particularly high hopes on the then so-called "liberal-leaning" Pope. These hopes, of course, were dashed, so he finally failed.

    The Gadfly was a member of the Young Italy Party, but he was closer to the people than Mazzini and others. He had experienced all kinds of hardships and had personally suffered from the deception and betrayal of church priests. He saw through the hypocrisy of the Pope and the Church and resolutely opposed them. He was connected with the revolutionary organizations of the mountain people and carried out armed uprisings. After the failure, he was arrested and heroically sacrificed.

    Many young readers who have read this book find it difficult to understand and have raised some questions. They ask, "Such a Mazzini party member from more than a hundred years ago, we can see some obvious shortcomings in him, what can we learn from him today?"

    This is what we must answer.

    The Gadfly deeply attracts us with his firmness, severity, and clear and profound love and hatred. Some young readers asked after reading this book: "Why is the Gadfly's character so stern, cold, as if he hates everyone, and always ridicules people? Why isn't he as lively and happy as Zoya and Matrosov, and so full of love for life?" This is because the Gadfly grew up in an era when the Italian people were persecuted by enemies at home and abroad. Later, he discovered that he was the illegitimate son of the priest Montanelli, and he lived a long life of suffering in South America. The life of persecution and humiliation damaged his body and mind and tempered his character to be stronger. The character of such a person is certainly not the same as that of Zoya and Matrosov, who grew up in the beautiful garden of socialism and were carefully cultivated by state educational institutions and families. But it is also wrong to think that his character is only cold and stern, and that he hates everyone. The Gadfly's love for his country is very clear. When he was young, he swore with religious fervor: "I will dedicate my life to Italy and help her liberate herself from slavery and poverty." For this, he fought from the age of nineteen when he was imprisoned until his death. On his deathbed, he also said: "Only we are life and youth, only we are the eternal spring, only we are the future! Father, the dawn is near—don't you want to see the sunrise?" What a passionate hymn to the future of the motherland!

    The Gadfly loves the people, and the people care about him. When he picked up a stray child on the street, he was so caring and considerate to the child; he showed ardent sympathy for the clown in the vaudeville troupe who twisted his body for people's amusement. After he was arrested, the executioners tortured him, but the soldiers sympathized with him. When they were ordered to shoot him, the soldiers all aimed to the side. After the Gadfly died, a soldier risked his life to send out his will for him. Obviously, it was the Gadfly's revolutionary enthusiasm and courage, like sunshine, shining into their miserable lives, that could make them so.

    The Gadfly hates the enemy. In front of the enemy, he is truly cold and hard, like steel. The book vividly describes his hostility and contempt for the reactionary rulers. When they interrogated him, he mocked them and laughed at them, so that the reactionary military commander could not help but admit: "The way he acts, people would think the judge is the prisoner, and he is the judge." The book even more prominently depicts the Gadfly's hatred for the Church, which makes some young readers raise the question: "Why does the Gadfly hate religion and the Church so much? It seems even deeper than his hatred for the reactionary rulers. Is it because of personal hatred?" In fact, the book has already mentioned that when the Gadfly was betrayed by Cardi, another city, Pisa, was also discovering that a priest was a spy. The incident of being betrayed by Cardi was just an introduction. From here, he saw through the truth that the local Catholic Church at that time colluded with the Austrian invaders and the reactionary rulers of his own country. This is precisely where he is superior to the big bourgeoisie and other Mazzini party members written in the book. He made a clear analysis of the Pope, the Church, and Montanelli as a person. He compared the Church at that time to a pickpocket, "comparing Italy to a drunkard, hugging the neck of a pickpocket and crying, while the pickpocket is picking his pocket." Some young readers asked: "Montanelli doesn't seem too bad, he loves the Gadfly, why does the Gadfly hate him so much?" We must not forget that the Pope at that time was wearing a hypocritical guise of so-called "liberalism." Priests like Montanelli, who were full of benevolence and talked about the "human rights" of prisoners, were precisely the appropriate representatives of the Pope and the Church. On the one hand, he was shocked to see the prisoner's body tied with belts, saying it was "barbaric behavior," but on the other hand, he agreed to carry out secret interrogation and secret execution of prisoners. Even when he finally discovered that the Gadfly was his beloved son, although he was saddened and mad for his son's death, in the end his reactionary political stance prevailed, and he agreed with the military commander's opinion and killed the Gadfly. The result of this conflict sharply showed what Montanelli was in essence. The Gadfly said: Montanelli's task was "to maintain the enthusiasm of the general public for the new Pope as it is now, and not let it wane, and at the same time to attract public attention." It should be admitted that the reason why the Gadfly hated Montanelli was mainly because he had such a clear understanding of Montanelli's church representative.

    From the love for the motherland and the people and the hatred for the enemy, arose the Gadfly's firm revolutionary will. For the sake of the revolution, he endured all hardships. When he narrated his painful wandering life in South America, Gemma asked him: "Why didn't you commit suicide?" He replied: "Do you think, what about my work? Who can replace me to do it?" In the secret court, in prison, and on the execution ground, he calmly endured the enemy's various physical and mental tortures. In his will on his deathbed, he wrote: "I will go to the courtyard with a light heart, like a primary school student going home for vacation. I have done my duty." What a fearless spirit of regarding death as home! Where does this strong spirit come from? When the enemy thought he would be afraid at the time of his execution, he calmly announced to the enemy with laughter: "When it's our turn to clean you up, we will use cannons instead of these half-broken old muskets." Obviously, it was precisely because of this belief in the inevitable victory of the revolution that he was able to have such a strong spirit. This belief not only supported him to endure the enemy's torture, but also supported him to restrain personal feelings that were incompatible with the interests of the revolution. The Gadfly had father-son feelings for Montanelli, and he often felt pain when he fought against Montanelli. But he still insisted on fighting without mercy. He clearly expressed his position in front of Montanelli, "There can be no other relationship between you and me. Except for war, war, or war." In the end, he shed tears and wanted to win Montanelli over, but when Montanelli refused, he said no more and walked to the execution ground.

    Such love for the motherland and the people, hatred for the enemy, and such a strong and indomitable revolutionary will are all worth learning from us.

    However, due to different historical conditions, some of the Gadfly's thoughts and behaviors are not what we should learn. For example, the revolutionary methods of the Gadfly and others are fundamentally unacceptable to us. He is somewhat different from Mazzini, because he does not place his hopes on the Pope and the King, and is connected with some mountain people, unlike Mazzini and others who completely "only know the liberal aristocracy and knowledgeable citizens in the city." However, like Mazzini, he does not rely on organizing the masses to rise up in revolution, but wants to seize power by means of a conspiracy by a small number of revolutionaries. He also affirmed the erroneous means of assassination, and his analysis of the "root of all chaos and errors" is also incorrect. In addition, his view of love is not correct. He does not love Chida Leoni, but cohabits with her, regarding this woman only as an object to vent his lust. He loves Gemma, but reluctantly suppresses his feelings. His hysterical and adventurous emotions of seeking stimulation are not good, and he did not try his best to reduce sacrifices for the long-term interests of the revolution. His attitude towards Montanelli is basically able to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, but it is still morbid. The most prominent point is that when Montanelli ran in front of him and blocked his gun aimed at the enemy, the hand holding the gun actually dropped, resulting in his arrest. The author spent a lot of ink to describe this personal tragedy - the father loves the son, but does not dare to explain it; the son loves the father, but cannot get close to him. The father and son stand on opposite positions, the son opposes the father, and the father kills the son. Especially the last section where Montanelli goes mad with grief after killing the Gadfly is written very vividly. Such a tragic ending is naturally Montanelli paying for his own sins, but such a lot of tragic descriptions of the father-son relationship do indeed confuse people's understanding of the main contradiction between Montanelli and the Gadfly in some places.

    Young readers have raised many, many more of these types of questions. Why are there these questions? Because the author of "The Gadfly" is not a Marxist, and the Gadfly written by the author is not a Marxist either. When Voynich was writing this book, Lenin had just begun his revolutionary activities. In the Gadfly's era, in the 1830s and 1840s, although the working class in the major European countries such as England and France had grown up and began to get involved in the struggle against capitalism, backward Italy was still suffering from national oppression and the feudal oppression of the Church and landlords, and the working class had not yet grown strong. The Gadfly created under such historical conditions is bound to be limited by the times, and there are certain serious shortcomings in the ideological feelings of this typical revolutionary fighter created by Voynich, which is understandable. A considerable number of young readers have always been accustomed to reading books such as "How the Steel Was Tempered" and "The Story of Zoya and Shura." When reading "The Gadfly," they don't know how to read it, and they also want to look at the Gadfly with the eyes of Paul and Zoya, and learn from the Gadfly in the way they learn from Paul and Zoya, and as a result, many questions arise. Some young people therefore expressed disappointment with this work, and some even suggested that young people should not read this type of work at all. In fact, it should not be too difficult for our high school students and college students to read such books. The main problem here is how to cultivate young people's ability to read classical works, and how to educate young people to look at problems from a historical point of view, and not to demand the ancients with today's requirements. We should have the ability to draw nourishment from the wisdom of our predecessors. It is wrong to adopt a rejecting attitude towards all past works because we are afraid of "not being able to criticize."

### 读“牛虻”

    读“牛虻”
    英国伏尼契著　李俍民译　中国青年出版社一九五三年七月出版
    韦君宜
    在“钢铁是怎样炼成的”和“卓娅和舒拉的故事”两本书里，提到保尔和卓娅都爱读“牛虻”，都受到过这本书的教育。因此，“牛虻”中译本一出版，就被广大青年读者争相阅读了。这本书描写了一百多年以前意大利民族解放运动中的英雄人物，描写了历史上那为了人民而流血的志士仁人的精神面貌。那名为牛虻的英雄的政治思想以及对问题的认识，与我们这时代的英雄不同，但我们敬爱他们，正如我们敬爱我们“水浒”里的英雄或太平天国的英雄。他们是我们的先辈，有许多地方，我们是可以向他们学习的。
    “牛虻”所反映的是十九世纪三十年代到四十年代的意大利，正当意大利受到奥地利的压迫的时代。意大利被分割为几个小国（包括教皇领地），好几个小国的统治者都是奥地利皇室的亲属或走狗，教会也是奥地利的同盟者。残酷的压迫使意大利人民无法忍受。在二十年代烧炭党人起义之后，又有小资产阶级的民主主义者、革命家玛志尼创立了“青年意大利党”，他们提出的任务是：“复兴意大利，使它成为自由、平等的统一国家，成为统一、独立、自主的意大利。”同时还有一些大地主和资产阶级分子，倡导国家再统一运动，他们拥护教皇，主张建立独立的君主国家。青年意大利党为祖国解放进行了二十年的斗争，但是，玛志尼不依靠群众，主要想以密谋方法取得政权。他曾一再写信吁请庇埃蒙（那些小国之一）国王和教皇起来领导意大利的民族解放运动。对于当时号称“倾向自由主义”的教皇尤其寄予很高的希望。这些希望当然落了空，所以他最后终于失败。
    牛虻就是青年意大利党的一分子，但他比玛志尼等更接近人民，他经历过各种艰苦，还亲身受过教会神父的欺骗与出卖。他看透了教皇和教会的伪善，坚决反对他们。他与山民的革命组织相联系，进行武装起义活动。事败被捕，英勇地牺牲了。
    有许多青年读者读了这本书，感到难于理解，提出了一些问题。他们问：“这样一个一百多年前的玛志尼党人，我们可以从他身上看出一些明显的缺点，有什么地方可以供今天的我们学习呢？”
    这就是我们必须回答的。
    牛虻以他的坚毅、严峻、明确深刻的爱与憎，深深吸引了我们。有的青年读者读过这本书之后发问：“为什么牛虻的性格这样严峻、冷酷、好像对什么人都恨，老是嘲笑人？为什么不像卓娅、马特洛索夫那样活泼愉快、那样热爱着生命？”这是由于牛虻成长的年代正是意大利人民受内外敌人迫害的年代，之后他又发现自己是教士蒙泰尼里的私生子，又在南美过了长期的苦难生活，受迫害、受侮辱的生活毁损了他的身心，也把他的性格锤炼得更加刚强。这样的人的性格，和在社会主义的美丽花园里由国家教育机关和家庭小心培植长大的卓娅和马特洛索夫等当然不会相同。但如果认为他的性格只是冷酷严峻，对什么人都恨，却也是不对的。牛虻对于祖国的爱是很鲜明的。他年轻的时候，就以宗教的热情宣誓：“要把我的生命献给意大利，帮助她从奴役和贫困之中解放出来。”为了这，他从十九岁坐监狱起，一直斗争到死。他临死时还说：“只有我们才是生命和青春，只有我们才是永恒的春天，只有我们才是未来！神父，曙光近在我们眼前——难道你不愿意看到日出吗？”这是多么热烈的对于祖国未来的歌颂啊！
    牛虻爱人民，人民也关心他。当他在街上拾到一个流浪的小孩时，他对孩子是那样关心、体贴；他对扭曲着身体供人玩笑的杂耍班小丑表示了热烈的同情。在他被捕之后，刽子手们折磨他，但士兵们同情他。在奉命枪毙他的时候，士兵们都向旁边瞄准。一个士兵在牛虻死后冒着生命危险替他送出遗书。很显然，是牛虻的革命热情和勇气，像阳光一样照到他们悲惨的生活中，才能使得他们如此。
    牛虻痛恨敌人。在敌人面前，他真是又冷又硬，像钢铁一样。书中生动地描写他对反动统治者的敌视和蔑视。他们审问他时，他嘲讽他们，笑他们，使那个反动的军长都不能不承认：“那样子人家还以为审判官是犯人，他倒是审判官呢。”书中更突出地描写了牛虻对于教会的痛恨，这使有些青年读者提出问题：“牛虻为什么那样特别痛恨宗教、痛恨教会？似乎比恨反动统治者还深，是不是因为个人仇恨？”事实上，书中已经提到，在牛虻被卡尔狄出卖的时候，另外一个城市比萨也正发现了一个教士是间谍。被卡尔狄出卖的事件只是一个引子，从这里开始，他看透了当时当地天主教会与奥地利侵略者和本国反动统治者勾结的真相。这正是他高出于书中所写的大资产阶级分子和其他玛志尼党人的地方。他对教皇、教会、和蒙泰尼里这个人，都作过清楚的分析，他把当时的教会比作扒手，“把意大利比作一个醉汉，搂住一个扒手的颈子在哀哭，而那扒手却正在掏他的口袋”。有的青年读者问：“蒙泰尼里好像也不太坏，他爱牛虻，牛虻为什么那样恨他呢？”我们不要忘记，当时的教皇是带有所谓“自由主义”的虚伪幌子的。像蒙泰尼里这样满口仁慈、高谈囚犯的“人权”的教士，正是教皇和教会的适当代表。他一面看了囚犯身上捆着皮带就大惊小怪，说是“野蛮行为”，一面却同意对犯人实行秘密审问和秘密处死。即便在最后他发现了牛虻就是自己所钟爱的儿子以后，尽管他一面为儿子的死悲痛、发狂，但最后还是他的反动政治立场占了上风，他同意了军长的意见，杀死了牛虻。这一冲突的结果，尖锐地表现了蒙泰尼里在本质上是一个什么东西。牛虻说过：蒙泰尼里的任务就是“要维持一般人对新教皇现有的热情，不让它衰退下去，同时要吸引公众的注意”。应当承认，牛虻所以痛恨蒙泰尼里，主要是由于他对蒙泰尼里这样的教会代表有了这样明确的认识的缘故。
    从对祖国对人民的爱和对敌人的恨，产生了牛虻底坚强的革命意志。为了革命，他忍受一切苦难。当他叙述在南美洲痛苦的流浪生活时，琼玛问他：“你为什么没有自杀呢？”他回答：“你想，我的工作怎么办呢？谁能代替我去做呢？”在秘密法庭里，在牢狱里，在刑场上，他镇定地忍受敌人对他的肉体上和精神上的各种摧残。在临死的遗书上，他写着：“我将怀着轻松的心情走到院子里去，好像一个小学生放假回家一般。我已经尽了我工作的本分”。这是何等大无畏的视死如归的气概！这种坚强的精神是从那里来的呢？看他临刑时候，敌人以为他会害怕，他却从容谈笑地对敌人宣布：“轮到我们收拾你们的时候，我们就要用大炮来代替这半打破旧的马枪了。”显然，正是由于这个对革命必然胜利的信念，使他能够有那样刚强的气概。这种信念不但支持他忍受了敌人的折磨，而且支持他克制了与革命利益不相容的个人私情。牛虻对蒙泰尼里是有父子感情的，他向蒙泰尼里进行战斗的时候，时常感到痛苦。但是他还是不留情地坚持战斗了。在蒙泰尼里面前鲜明地表示了自己的立场，“你我之间不能有别的任何关系了。除掉战争，战争，还是战争”。最后他曾流了泪，想争取蒙泰尼里，但是当蒙泰尼里拒绝之后，他就不再多说，走向了刑场。
    这样爱祖国、爱人民、痛恨敌人的精神，这样坚强勇毅、百折不挠的革命意志，都是值得我们学习的。
    但由于历史条件的不同，牛虻的某些思想行为，是我们不应当学习的。例如牛虻他们的革命方法，那是我们根本不能采取的。他与玛志尼有些不同，因为他对教皇和国王并不寄予希望，而且与一些山民有着联系，不像玛志尼他们那样完全“只知道城市里自由主义的贵族和有知识的公民”。但是，他与玛志尼一样，不是依靠组织群众起来革命，而是要以少数革命家密谋的办法取得政权的。他对暗杀的错误手段也加以肯定，对“一切混乱和错误的根源”的分析也是不对的。此外，他对于爱情的看法不正确。他不爱绮达·莱尼，却与她同居，把这个女子只看作发泄情欲的对象。他爱琼玛，却勉强压抑自己的感情。他寻找刺激的歇斯底里病态情绪、冒险情绪，是不好的，没有为了革命的长远利益尽力减少牺牲。他对蒙泰尼里的态度基本上是认得出敌我的，但也还是有着病态的。最突出的一点就是当蒙泰尼里跑到他面前挡住他射向敌人的枪口的时候，他拿枪的手竟垂下来了，以致被捕。作者花费了很多笔墨来描写这一幕个人的悲剧——父亲爱儿子，不敢说明；儿子爱父亲，不能去亲近。父子站在相反的立场，儿子反对父亲，父亲杀了儿子。尤其是最后蒙泰尼里杀死牛虻之后悲痛发疯那一节，写得非常生动。这样的悲惨结局自然是蒙泰尼里自食其果，但是这样多的关于父子关系的悲剧描写，确是也在有些地方混淆了人们对于蒙泰尼里与牛虻的主要矛盾的认识。
    这类的问题，青年读者们还提出了很多很多。为什么会有这些问题？因为“牛虻”的作者并不是马克思主义者，作者所写的牛虻也不是马克思主义者。在伏尼契写作这本书时，列宁刚刚开始革命活动。在牛虻的时代，在十九世纪三、四十年代，欧洲的英法等主要国家的工人阶级虽然已经成长起来，开始卷入反对资本主义的斗争，但落后的意大利还是苦于民族压迫和教会、地主的封建压迫，工人阶级还没有壮大起来。在这样历史条件下创造出来的牛虻，必然要受到时代的限制，在伏尼契所创造的这位革命志士典型的思想感情中存在着某些严重的缺点，那是可以理解的。有相当多的青年读者一向读惯了“钢铁是怎样炼成的”“卓娅和舒拉的故事”这些书，读“牛虻”不知道怎样读法，也想以看保尔、卓娅的眼光去看牛虻，以学习保尔、卓娅的方法去学习牛虻，结果就发生了很多疑问。有的青年因此对这一作品表示失望，有些人并且提出：这一类作品青年可以根本不要读。其实我们的高中学生、大学生读这样的书，应该不会发生太多困难。这里面的主要问题是怎样培养青年阅读古典作品的能力，怎样教育青年用历史观点看问题，不以今天的要求去要求古人。我们应该有从我们上代的人们的智慧成果中汲取营养的能力。因为怕“批判不了”而对过去的一切作品都采取拒绝态度，是错误的。
