    Instructions of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on Clearing Up Existing Investigation and Statistics Forms and Prohibiting the Random Issuance of Investigation and Statistics Forms

    With the commencement of the state's planned economic construction, governments at all levels and their respective departments have begun to emphasize statistical work and have achieved certain successes in this area. However, during the recent anti-bureaucracy movement across the country, it was found that the phenomenon of various agencies randomly issuing investigation and statistics forms is very serious, especially in rural areas where the proliferation of forms has become a disaster, one of the "five excesses." Many investigation and statistics forms have complex items, duplicate content, and even put forward various absurd and naive requirements, wasting countless human and material resources, resulting in increasingly chaotic statistical figures. The chaotic state of investigation and statistics work has become a heavy burden on cadres at all levels and has created a very negative impact among the masses, hindering production and other important work, and making statistical departments and grassroots organizations busy dealing with various repetitive and complex forms, preventing the genuine investigation and statistics work urgently needed for national construction from being carried out seriously.

    Investigation and statistics are important methods for us to understand situations, make policies, and guide work, especially important tools for establishing a planned economy. In order to establish scientific statistical work, we must treat investigation and statistics with a responsible attitude, establish a system, and prohibit the random issuance of investigation and statistics forms. The serious shortcomings mentioned above in past investigation and statistics work, in addition to the excessive and urgent demands of certain leading agencies and their statistical and business departments for investigation and statistics, are primarily due to certain agencies using subjective, decentralized, and bureaucratic methods to conduct investigation and statistics. Investigation and statistics forms are issued frequently and urgently, without fully considering the needs and possibilities, without careful and thorough design of how to formulate investigation and statistics forms, and without serious sorting and research of the obtained data. Many agencies (even several departments within the same agency) often do not communicate with each other, and without prescribed approval procedures, each issues its own set of investigation and statistics forms. Secondly, governments at all levels, statistical departments, and business departments have not strictly managed investigation and statistics work, and the approval system for investigation and statistics reports has not been seriously and thoroughly established, so that the anarchic state of statistical work has continued to spread and has not been quickly prevented.

    In order to correct the above-mentioned chaotic phenomena in statistical work, governments at all levels, statistical departments, and business departments must conduct a serious cleanup of the currently rampant investigation and statistics forms, and strictly control the issuance of investigation and statistics forms in the future. It should be recognized that the state's planned economic construction has just begun, and the need for investigation and statistical data in various aspects is very urgent; however, the foundation of the current investigation and statistics work is weak, and it is not possible to fully meet the requirements of all parties. Therefore, when arranging investigation and statistics work, it is necessary to grasp the key points, distinguish different situations, and carefully consider needs and possibilities. Forms that are not urgently needed for work should be resolutely abolished; those that are needed for work but cannot be filled out by lower levels should not be forced to be arranged; forms that are urgently needed for work and can be filled out should continue to be implemented; but research should also be done on how to simplify form indicators and adopt practical and simple methods. Especially in rural areas, the characteristics of the small-scale peasant economy should be grasped, and excessive investigation and statistics should not be conducted, so the forms issued to districts and townships should be strictly controlled. Governments at all levels, statistical departments, and business departments should all follow this principle to clean up various investigation and statistics forms in their own agencies and regions, and strictly control the investigation and statistics forms issued in the future. In order to facilitate hierarchical responsibility and complete the cleanup of existing forms within a limited time, the following specific measures are hereby stipulated:

    (1) Investigation and statistics forms formulated and issued by the State Statistical Bureau shall be cleaned up by the State Statistical Bureau in conjunction with relevant departments. Investigation and statistics forms approved by the State Statistical Bureau shall still be cleaned up by the original formulating agency, and the State Statistical Bureau shall be responsible for inspection and supervision. The State Statistical Bureau shall also be responsible for inspecting and supervising the form cleanup work of central business departments and various regions, and report the national cleanup results to the Government Administration Council before the end of this year.

    (2) Each commission, ministry, committee, academy, bureau, and bank of the central government and its affiliated professional administration bureau should, under the leadership of the head of the department, formulate methods by the statistical agency in conjunction with relevant units to clean up the investigation and statistics forms formulated and issued by its agency. The cleanup results should be submitted to the head of the department for final review by the end of November, and reported to the State Statistical Bureau for record.

    (3) The form cleanup work of each major administrative region (including the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the same below) should be under the leadership of the administrative committee of the major administrative region, and the statistical bureau of the major administrative region should formulate specific cleanup methods. The business departments and people's organizations at the level of the major administrative region should clean up the investigation and statistics forms formulated and issued by themselves, and report the cleanup results to the statistical bureau of the major administrative region for review before November 15, and then report to the administrative committee of the major administrative region for final review. The investigation and statistics forms formulated, issued, or approved by the statistical bureau of the major administrative region shall still be cleaned up by the original formulating agency, and the approving agency shall be responsible for inspection and supervision. The statistical bureau of the major administrative region shall report the entire region's cleanup results to the State Statistical Bureau for record before the end of November.

    (4) The form cleanup work of each province and city should be under the leadership of the provincial and municipal people's governments, and the provincial and municipal statistical bureaus (offices) should formulate cleanup methods. The business departments and people's organizations at the provincial and municipal levels should clean up the investigation and statistics forms formulated and issued by themselves, and report the initial cleanup results to the provincial and municipal statistical bureaus (offices) for review before the end of October, and then report to the provincial and municipal people's governments for final review. The statistical forms formulated, issued, or approved by the provincial and municipal statistical bureaus (offices) shall still be cleaned up by the original formulating agency, and the approving agency shall be responsible for inspection and supervision. The provincial and municipal statistical bureaus (offices) shall report the entire province's and city's cleanup results to the statistical bureau of the major administrative region and the State Statistical Bureau for record before November 15.

    (5) All investigation and statistics forms formulated and issued by the people's governments and people's organizations at the levels of special district (league), county (city, banner), town, district, and township shall be invalidated. Those that must be retained should be reported to the provincial and municipal statistical bureaus (offices) for review and approval.

    (6) If statistical agencies and business departments at all levels encounter difficulties in the implementation of investigation and statistics forms formulated and issued by higher-level statistical agencies and business departments, they should report to higher levels for cleanup.

    (7) Investigation and statistics forms formulated and issued by provincial, municipal, and higher-level statistical agencies and business departments that have been approved according to law shall remain valid until a final decision is made after cleanup. Forms that have been decided to be abolished after cleanup shall be notified by the original formulating agency to the reporting units and comprehensive units.

    (8) Before the issuance of this instruction, major administrative regions, provinces, and cities that have already formulated methods to clean up investigation and statistics forms may continue to proceed according to the original methods, but should make necessary supplementary provisions with reference to the spirit of this instruction.

    At the same time as cleaning up investigation and statistics forms, governments at all levels and business departments must attach importance to investigation and statistics work and earnestly complete the investigation and statistics tasks stipulated by the state; prevent the possible tendency of not paying attention to investigation and statistics work due to the cleanup of investigation and statistics forms, and resisting the investigation and statistics tasks stipulated by the state. In order to carry out investigation and statistics work in a planned and organized manner in the future, the heads of governments at all levels and business departments must effectively strengthen their leadership over investigation and statistics work, seriously and gradually establish a scientific investigation and statistics system, and educate cadres to recognize the importance and complexity of statistical work, and its impact on the masses. The formulation of each form must be carefully studied from both the aspects of need and possibility, and rash action should be avoided. The State Statistical Bureau is also instructed to draft "Provisional Measures for the Formulation and Approval of Investigation and Statistics Reports," which will be issued for trial implementation after being approved by this Council, so as to manage them level by level and prevent the random issuance of statistical forms from happening again in the future.

    中央人民政府政务院
    关于清理现行调查统计表格及禁止乱发调查统计表格的指示
    国家有计划的经济建设开始，各级政府及其各业务部门均已开始重视统计工作，并已在这一方面取得了一定的成绩。但最近在全国反官僚主义运动中，检查出许多机关乱发调查统计表格的现象十分严重，特别是农村中表格泛滥成灾，成为“五多”之一。许多调查统计表格项目繁杂，内容互相重复，甚至提出了各种荒唐幼稚的要求，浪费了无数的人力物力，其结果反使统计数字愈益混乱。调查统计工作的混乱状态，已经成为各级干部的一项沉重的负担，并在群众中造成十分恶劣的影响，妨碍生产工作及其它重要工作的正常进行，并使统计部门及各基层组织忙于应付各种重复和繁杂的表格，使真正为国家建设所迫切需要的调查统计工作不能认真进行。
    调查统计是我们了解情况，据以决定政策、指导工作的重要方法，尤其是建立计划经济的重要工具。为着建立科学统计工作，必须用认真负责的态度来对待调查统计，必须建立制度，禁止乱发调查统计表格。过去调查统计工作所以发生上述严重缺点，除某些领导机关及其统计部门、业务部门对调查统计要求过多过急外，首先是由于某些机关用主观主义、分散主义、官僚主义的方法来进行调查统计。调查统计的表格发得多，要得急，没有充分考虑需要与可能，对如何制订调查统计表格既未作审慎的周密的设计，亦未对所得到的资料进行认真的整理和研究。许多机关（甚至同一机关中的若干处科）往往互不联系，不经规定审批手续，各自颁发一套套的调查统计表格。其次是由于各级政府、统计部门及各业务部门对于调查统计工作管理不严，调查统计报表的审批制度并未认真地、周密地建立起来，以致统计工作的无政府状态得以继续蔓延，未能迅速防止。
    为着纠正统计工作的上述混乱现象，各级政府、统计部门及各业务部门必须对目前泛滥着的调查统计表格作一番认真的清理，并对今后颁发调查统计表格加以严格控制。应该认识目前国家有计划的经济建设刚刚开始，各方面对调查统计资料的需要十分迫切；但目前调查统计工作基础薄弱，尚不可能完全满足各方面的要求。因此在布置调查统计工作时必须掌握重点，分别不同情况，认真考虑需要与可能。凡非工作所迫切需要的表格应该坚决废止；工作上虽有需要，但下面无力填报者，也勿勉强布置；凡属工作上迫切需要而又能够填报的表格，则应继续贯彻执行；但亦应该研究如何简化表格指标，采取切合实际和简单易行的方法。特别在农村中更应该掌握小农经济的特点，不应当作过多的调查和统计，因此发到区乡去的表格更应严格控制。各级政府、统计部门及各业务部门均应本此原则，来清理本机关及本地区的各种调查统计表格，并认真控制今后颁发的调查统计表格。为便于分级负责，限期完成现行表格的清理工作，兹特规定以下几项具体办法：
    （一）凡国家统计局制订颁发的调查统计表格，由国家统计局会同有关部门进行清理，凡经国家统计局批准的调查统计表格，仍由原制订机关清理，国家统计局负责检查督促。国家统计局并应负责检查督促中央各业务部门及各地区的表格清理工作，于本年底前将全国清理结果报告政务院。
    （二）中央各委、部、会、院、署、行及其所属专业管理局，应在各该部门首长领导下，由统计机构会同有关单位，拟定办法，将本机关所制订颁发的调查统计表格进行清理，于十一月底前将清理结果经各该部门首长最后审定，报国家统计局备查。
    （三）各大行政区（包括内蒙自治区，下同）的清理表格工作，应在大行政区行政委员会领导下，由大行政区统计局拟定具体清理办法，分别由大行政区一级各业务部门及各人民团体就其自行制订颁发的调查统计表格进行清理，于十一月十五日前将清理结果报大行政区统计局审查后，转报大行政区行政委员会作最后审定。其由大行政区统计局制订颁发或批准的调查统计表格，仍由原制订机关负责清理，批准机关负责检查督促。大行政区统计局应将全区清理结果于十一月底前报国家统计局备查。
    （四）各省、市清理表格工作应在省、市人民政府领导下，由省、市统计局（处）拟定清理办法，分别由省、市一级各业务部门、各人民团体就其自行制订颁发的调查统计表格进行清理，于十月底前将初步清理结果报省、市统计局（处）审查后转报省、市人民政府作最后审定。其由省、市统计局（处）制订颁发或批准的统计表格，仍由原制订机关负责清理，批准机关负责检查督促。省、市统计局（处）应将全省、市清理结果，于十一月十五日前分报大行政区统计局及国家统计局备查。
    （五）凡前经专署（盟）、县（市、旗）、镇、区、乡各级人民政府和人民团体所制订颁发的调查统计表格，应一律作废。其必须保留者，应报省、市统计局（处）审核批准。
    （六）各级统计机关及各业务部门对上级统计机关及各业务部门所制订颁发的调查统计表格，在执行中如发现有困难时，应报上级要求清理。
    （七）省、市及省、市以上各级统计机关及各业务部门所制订颁发的调查统计表格，凡经依法批准者，在未经清理作出最后决定前应继续有效。凡经清理后决定废止的表格，即由原制订机关通知填报单位及综合单位。
    （八）在本指示颁发前，各大行政区，各省、市已经制订办法进行清理调查统计表格者，可按原办法继续进行，但应参考本指示精神作必要的补充规定。
    与清理调查统计表格同时，各级政府及各业务部门必须重视调查统计工作，切实完成国家所规定的调查统计任务；防止因清理调查统计表格而可能发生对调查统计工作不重视，以及对国家所规定的调查统计任务抗拒应付等类偏向。今后为了有计划、有组织地进行调查统计工作，各级政府及各业务部门首长必须切实加强对调查统计工作的领导，认真地、逐步地建立科学的调查统计制度，并应教育干部认识统计工作的重要性和复杂性，及其对群众的影响，制订每一表格均必须从需要和可能两方面来认真研究，切忌草率从事。并责成国家统计局草拟“制订及审批调查统计报表暂行办法”，经本院批准后颁发试行，以便逐级管理，使乱发统计表格的事情今后不再发生。
