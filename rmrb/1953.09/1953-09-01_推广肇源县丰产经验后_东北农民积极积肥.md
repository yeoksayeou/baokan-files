Following the promotion of Zhaoyuan County's high-yield experience, farmers in Northeast China are actively accumulating fertilizer.

    During the off-season, most areas of Northeast China have been carrying out the work of composting and accumulating fertilizer. In Longhua County, Rehe Province, 16,000 *jin* of green manure has already been pressed. In Chaoyang County, 90 percent of farm households in mountainous areas and 70 percent in plains areas are engaged in fertilizer accumulation and composting. In Shulan County, Jilin Province, the average village has accumulated 20 percent of the total amount of fertilizer needed for the year, and better villages have completed more than 30 percent. In Qian'an County, Heilongjiang Province, the Solidarity Agricultural Production Cooperative has accumulated half of the required fertilizer amount. The main reason for the enthusiasm for fertilizer accumulation in Northeast China this year is that after the promotion of the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience, the number of plants per unit area has increased, and fertilizer application is particularly needed, so the masses are actively accumulating fertilizer. In some areas, due to flood and pest control or insufficient leadership attention, fertilizer accumulation work has not been done well. The leadership in these areas has already taken notice.

    推广肇源县丰产经验后
    东北农民积极积肥
    东北大部地区在挂锄期间开展了沤粪积肥工作。热河省隆化县已压绿肥一万六千余斤。朝阳县山区百分之九十、平原区百分之七十的农户都在进行积肥沤粪工作。吉林省舒兰县一般村已攒出全年积肥数量的百分之二十，较好的村已完成百分之三十以上。黑龙江省瞻榆县团结生产合作社积肥数量已达到需要肥料的一半。今年东北地区的积肥工作之所以如此热烈，主要因为推广肇源丰产经验以后，单位面积株数增加，施肥特别需要，所以群众都积极积肥。部分地区由于防汛防虫或由于领导上抓得不够紧，积肥工作没有搞好。这些地方的领导方面已经引起了注意。    （刘相国）
