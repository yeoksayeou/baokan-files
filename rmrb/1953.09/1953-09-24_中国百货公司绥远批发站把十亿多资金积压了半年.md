    China Department Store Suiyuan Wholesale Station Had Over One Billion Yuan of Funds Frozen for Half a Year
    Zhao Wenbin of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee Working Group writes: The China Department Store Suiyuan Wholesale Station (hereinafter referred to as the Wholesale Station) had over one billion yuan of funds frozen in the bank, and it took half a year to discover this. The situation is as follows: The Wholesale Station purchased one hundred tons of ginned cotton from the Liaoxi Province Yixian Cotton Company. The accounting department of the Wholesale Station, according to the "bank collection" system, remitted over ten billion yuan to the Yixian Cotton Company through the Suihua branch of the People's Bank of China (hereinafter referred to as the Suihua Branch) on December 11th of last year, but did not notify the business department of the Wholesale Station. Five days later, the business department notified the accounting department to transfer the payment to the Yixian Cotton Company through the Shenyang office. The accounting department, with the attitude of "give money when asked, without asking the reason," complied. However, the Yixian Cotton Company received the payment transferred from the Shenyang office first. They just received the money, shipped the goods, and then received the same payment "collected" by the Yixian branch of the People's Bank of China (hereinafter referred to as the Yixian Branch), and immediately returned it. After receiving the refund, the Yixian Branch transferred it to the Suihua Branch, which still sent it to the Yixian Branch. The Yixian Branch had no choice but to send it to the Yixian Cotton Company again, resulting in unwanted, refunded, transferred, and sent again... After several twists and turns, these ten billion yuan went missing. It was not until May of this year that the accounting department discovered the duplicate payment for ginned cotton when clearing accounts. They immediately sent people to Shenyang and Yixian to search for it, and found that the money was frozen in the Yixian Branch, and as a result, they had to pay the bank over 33 million yuan in interest. The accounting department did not report this to higher authorities afterward. During the anti-bureaucracy movement, the employees of the Wholesale Station exposed this matter.
    This matter fully demonstrates the chaotic financial system and the serious bureaucratic work style of the leadership of the Wholesale Station. In the past, the Wholesale Station often complained about insufficient funds and repeatedly requested higher authorities to increase credit quotas, while constantly experiencing incidents of duplicate payments and incorrect payments of goods, resulting in the freezing of funds as described above.
    Accelerating the normal turnover of funds is one of the keys to increasing production and practicing economy in the commercial sector. In today's economic construction of the motherland, the phenomenon of large-scale fund freezing in the Wholesale Station is particularly intolerable. We hope they will examine and correct it.

### 中国百货公司绥远批发站把十亿多资金积压了半年

    中国百货公司绥远批发站把十亿多资金积压了半年
    中共黑龙江省委工作组赵文彬来信：中国百货公司绥远批发站（以下简称批发站）有十亿多资金积压在银行里，经过了半年的时间才发觉。事情是这样的：批发站向辽西省义县棉花公司购买了一百吨皮棉，批发站的财会科便按着“银行托收”制度在去年十二月十一日通过中国人民银行绥化支行（以下简称绥化支行）给义县棉花公司汇去货款十亿多元，但并没有通知批发站的业务科。过了五天，业务科通知财会科通过沈阳办事处给义县棉花公司结转这笔货款，财会科抱着“要钱就给，不问来由”的态度就照办了。但义县棉花公司先接到的是沈阳办事处转来的货款。他们刚把钱收下，把货发走，又收到中国人民银行义县支行（以下简称义县支行）“托收”来的同样一笔货款，当即给退回去。义县支行接到退款后便转给绥化支行，绥化支行仍给义县支行寄去，义县支行只得再给义县棉花公司，结果是不要、又退回、又转去、又寄来……。辗转数次后，这十亿多元竟下落不明了。直到今年五月，财会科清理账目时才发现重付了皮棉货款，随即派人到沈阳和义县二处去找，原来这笔款是积压在义县支行里了，结果还得给银行付出三千三百多万元利息。财会科事后也没有向上报告。反官僚主义运动中，批发站的职工把这事揭发了出来。
    这件事情充分说明批发站财务制度的混乱情况和领导方面的官僚主义作风是十分严重的。批发站在过去时常叫喊资金不足，屡次请求上级予以增加信贷指标，而本身却不断发生像上述重付、错付货款的积压资金事件。
    加速资金的正常周转是商业部门增产节约的关键之一，在祖国展开经济建设的今天，批发站的这种大量积压资金的现象特别使人不能容忍，希望他们检讨纠正。
