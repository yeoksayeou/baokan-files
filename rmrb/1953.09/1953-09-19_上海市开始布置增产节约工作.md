    【Our newspaper reports】The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held an enlarged meeting from September 12th to 15th to deploy increased production and thrift work. Pan Hannian, First Deputy Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, reported at the meeting on the main achievements of state-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private enterprises in Shanghai in completing state plans over the past six months. In terms of industry, most factories have completed or exceeded their planned output value. However, there are still many shortcomings in the execution of the plan. This is reflected in the fact that many factories, many products, and profit remittances have not completed the plan, and there are still imbalances, low quality, and high costs in production. In commerce, taxation, finance, etc., everyone has made certain achievements through joint efforts, but there are also shortcomings and errors. For example, the improvement of the market in the first half of the year was underestimated, and some measures were inappropriate, so that the state-owned commercial acquisition and wholesale business did not achieve the due expansion; a lot of materials prove that the phenomenon of tax evasion and tax evasion by Shanghai industrialists and businessmen is quite common and serious, which has caused huge losses to state tax revenue. Pan Hannian pointed out that the task for the next four months of this year is significant. In terms of industrial production, some raw materials and sales are guaranteed products, and with the approval of the higher authorities, production must be increased with leadership. All enterprises must strive to tap their potential, promote advanced experience, effectively improve product quality, reduce costs, and comprehensively complete and over fulfill the state plan. State-owned commerce must ensure that the processing, ordering and acquisition work is done well in order to expand commodity circulation, accelerate capital turnover, and reduce circulation costs. Tax cadres should closely rely on the vast number of workers, continuously improve their business, to plug loopholes in tax evasion, and collect all taxes that should be collected. Banks should serve production well. Private enterprises should do a good job in national processing and ordering, and improve product quality. All agencies should make appropriate adjustments based on the principles of streamlining, thrift, and improving work efficiency. Finally, Pan Hannian put forward the increased production and thrift plan formulated by the Shanghai Municipal Committee, and analyzed the possible conditions for realizing this plan. The responsible cadres of the district committees, enterprise party committees, government and mass organizations attending the meeting discussed Pan Hannian's report and the city's increased production and thrift plan separately, and everyone unanimously expressed their agreement and full confidence in realizing it. Finally, Chen Pixian, Fourth Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, made a concluding speech. He emphasized that the key to completing the task of increasing production and thrift lies in the unified and correct leadership of the Party committee and the full mobilization of the masses. Party committees at all levels must carry out full mobilization of increased production and thrift among the vast number of cadres and the masses, so that everyone fully recognizes the important significance of increased production and thrift, and combines the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses; the leadership must be combined with the active actions of the masses. Only in this way can the increased production and thrift competition develop healthily and achieve the expected goals.

    上海市开始布置增产节约工作
    【本报讯】中共上海市委员会在九月十二日到十五日召开扩大会议，布置增产节约工作。中共上海市委第一副书记潘汉年在会上报告了半年多以来上海市国营、地方国营、公私合营企业完成国家计划的主要情况。在工业方面，多数厂已经完成或超额完成了产值计划。但在执行计划中还存在着很多的缺点。这表现在不少工厂、不少产品和上缴利润没有完成计划，生产中还存在着不均衡、质量低、成本高的现象。在商业、税收、金融等方面，经过大家的共同努力，都获得了一定的成绩，但也有缺点和错误。例如：对上半年市场好转情况估计不足，有些措施失当，使国营商业的收购和批发业务没有获得应有的扩大；很多材料证明，上海工商业者偷税、漏税的现象是相当普遍的、严重的，这就造成了国家税收的巨大损失。潘汉年指出，今年今后的四个月，大家的任务是重大的。在工业生产方面，一些原料和销路都有保证的产品，经上级批准，要有领导地增加生产。各企业必须努力挖掘潜力，推广先进经验，切实提高产品质量，降低成本，全面地完成并超额完成国家计划。国营商业必须保证作好加工、订货和收购工作，以扩大商品流通，加速资金周转，降低流通费用。税收干部应紧密依靠广大工人，不断改进业务，以堵塞偷税的漏洞，把应该收的税全部收起来。银行应很好地为生产服务。私营企业应做好国家的加工、订货，提高产品质量。各机关应本精简节约、提高工作效率的原则，进行适当的调整。最后，潘汉年在会上提出了上海市委制订的增产节约方案，并分析了实现这个方案的可能条件。到会的各区委、企业党委、政府和群众团体党组织的负责干部，分头讨论了潘汉年的报告和市的增产节约方案，大家一致表示同意，并有充分的信心实现它。最后，中共上海市委第四书记陈丕显作总结发言，他强调指出，完成增产节约任务的关键，在于党委的统一正确的领导和充分地发动群众。各级党委必须在广大干部和群众中进行充分的增产节约的动员工作，使大家充分认识增产节约的重要意义，把群众的积极性和创造性结合起来；领导要和群众的积极行动结合起来。只有这样，才能使增产节约竞赛健康地发展，达到预期的目的。
