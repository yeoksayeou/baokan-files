    The Fujiatan Coal Mine Should Quickly Resolve the Underground Ventilation Problem in the Nanguan Pit
    Readers Wu Kangtian, Shi Lin, and Cui Sicong wrote: The underground ventilation problem in the Nanguan Pit of the Fujiatan Coal Mine in Shanxi Province has not been thoroughly resolved for a long time, seriously harming the health of the workers. In May and June alone, 45 people were injured by smoke from blasting due to poor ventilation.
    The Nanguan Pit resumed production in 1950 and has developed rapidly. The number of workers has increased more than sevenfold compared to the past, and the daily output has increased about tenfold. Therefore, the natural ventilation method used in the past cannot solve the underground ventilation problem at present—especially in the summer when the underground air volume is insufficient. From April to July of this year, the leading cadres of the Nanguan Pit conducted six major ventilation inspections, and adopted specific measures based on the principle of "strengthening sealing and eliminating air leakage," such as sealing air walls, installing and repairing air doors, and increasing ventilation workers; however, the problem still cannot be solved. According to the measurement results on July 15, the underground air intake only reached 12% to 20% of the air volume specified in the safety regulations (three cubic meters per person per minute).
    How should the problem be solved? I believe that for a mine pit with as many workers as the Fujiatan Coal Mine, if mechanical ventilation is not adopted and there is no ventilation fan with sufficient horsepower, even if attempts are made to improve it as much as possible, the fundamental problem cannot be solved. Constant work-related injuries, reduced worker efficiency, affected production, and increased costs due to poor ventilation equipment are detrimental to national construction work. It is recommended that the leaders of the Fujiatan Coal Mine and the Industry Department of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government pay attention to this issue and resolve it quickly.

### 富家滩煤矿应该迅速解决南关坑的坑下通风问题

    富家滩煤矿应该迅速解决南关坑的坑下通风问题
    读者吴康田、石林、崔思聪来信：山西省富家滩煤矿南关坑的坑下通风问题长期得不到彻底解决，严重损害了工人的身体健康。五、六两月中因通风不良而被炮烟薰伤的就有四十五人。
    南关坑在一九五○年恢复生产，发展很快，目前工人人数已比过去增加了七倍多，日产量也比过去提高了十倍左右。因此，过去所采用的自然通风办法在目前——特别是坑下风量不足的夏天，就不能解决坑下通风问题了。南关坑领导干部从今年四月到七月曾进行过六次通风大检查，根据“加强密闭、消灭漏风”的原则，采取了密闭风墙、安装和整修风门、增加通风工人等具体措施；但问题仍旧不能解决。据七月十五日测量结果，坑下进风量仅达保安规程规定风量（每人每分钟三立方公尺）的百分之十二到百分之二十。
    问题应该如何解决呢？我认为，像富家滩煤矿这样多工人的矿坑，如果不采用机械通风的办法，没有足够马力的通风机，而只采用自然通风的办法，即使尽量设法改进，也不能解决根本问题。因通风设备不良而不断发生工伤事故，降低工人工作效率，影响生产，加高成本，这对国家建设工作是不利的。建议富家滩煤矿领导方面和山西省人民政府工业厅应重视这个问题，并迅速加以解决。
