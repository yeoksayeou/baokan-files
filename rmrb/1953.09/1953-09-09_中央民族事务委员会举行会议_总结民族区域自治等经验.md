Xinhua News Agency, August 8th:

    The Third (Enlarged) Meeting of the Central People's Government Nationalities Affairs Commission was held in Beijing in June this year. The main achievements of this meeting were the summarization of the experiences in promoting ethnic regional autonomy in various regions and the experiences in animal husbandry production in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and some pastoral areas in Suiyuan, Qinghai, and Xinjiang. At the same time, the meeting also conducted a more detailed discussion on the election issues of various ethnic minorities. More than 120 people attended this enlarged meeting, including members of the Central People's Government Nationalities Affairs Commission, heads of nationalities affairs commissions from major administrative regions and most provinces and cities, and heads of relevant departments at the central level.

    At the meeting, Zhang Zhiyi, Vice Chairman of the Central People's Government Nationalities Affairs Commission, gave a report on current affairs, Liu Geping, Vice Chairman, conveyed the report on the election law of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China and local people's congresses at all levels regarding the election of ethnic minorities; Vice Chairmen Ulanhu and Wang Feng respectively reported on the "Basic Summary Draft on Animal Husbandry Production in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Some Pastoral Areas in Suiyuan, Qinghai, and Xinjiang" and the "Basic Summary Draft on the Experiences in Promoting Ethnic Regional Autonomy."

    After listening to the above reports, the meeting conducted a more detailed discussion on each report. The meeting considered that both the "Basic Summary Draft on Animal Husbandry Production in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Some Pastoral Areas in Suiyuan, Qinghai, and Xinjiang" and the "Basic Summary Draft on the Experiences in Promoting Ethnic Regional Autonomy" were excellent. From the "Basic Summary Draft on Animal Husbandry Production in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Some Pastoral Areas in Suiyuan, Qinghai, and Xinjiang," it can be seen not only that the animal husbandry economy is a component of China's new democratic economy, and that developing animal husbandry production is the basic content for developing the economy of pastoral areas, improving the lives of people of all ethnic groups in pastoral areas, and solving ethnic issues in pastoral areas, but also that it is an indispensable part of national industrialization and agricultural development. At the same time, from the summary draft, it can also be seen that our country has a relatively complete set of policies and mature experience in leading animal husbandry production. Animal husbandry production has broad prospects for development in our country. From the "Basic Summary Draft on the Experiences in Promoting Ethnic Regional Autonomy," it can be seen that our country has achieved great results in promoting ethnic regional autonomy and has gained much experience. The experiences proposed in the summary draft, such as the need to fully estimate the characteristics and specific conditions of all ethnic minorities in all work; the need to strengthen and consolidate the unity between and within ethnic groups; the need to gradually nationalize the autonomous organs; the need to help autonomous regions appropriately exercise their autonomous rights; and the need to do our best to develop political, economic, and cultural undertakings where possible, with particular attention to developing agricultural and animal husbandry production, will be of great help to places where autonomous regions have been established and where ethnic regional autonomy has not yet been implemented. Naturally, these experiences cannot be mechanically applied everywhere and should be applied based on the different specific conditions in each region.

    At the meeting, the members and the heads of the nationalities affairs commissions of the major administrative regions and provinces and cities introduced the situation and experience of ethnic work in their respective regions in their speeches; they made relentless exposures and criticisms of the main tendency existing in the current ethnic relations - Han chauvinism; and they also put forward many specific requirements and constructive opinions on the development of the political, economic, and cultural undertakings of the various ethnic minorities.

    Li Weihan, Chairman of the Central People's Government Nationalities Affairs Commission, made an important speech at the meeting. He pointed out that the meeting had been very fruitful and gave a brief explanation on the issue of the autonomous rights of ethnic autonomous regions and the issue of the construction of ethnic autonomous regions. He emphasized that the ethnic work in the future will gradually be different from that in the past few years. In the past few years, ethnic work was mainly political work. Now, although the situation in each region is different, and in some regions the main work is still political work, the general trend of ethnic work will gradually shift from political work as the main focus to attaching importance to both political work and economic and cultural construction, especially the work of improving and developing production. This is a new task. To this end, it is necessary to do a lot of basic investigation and research work. Cadres in each region and leaders of each ethnic autonomous region should attach importance to this work and shoulder this responsibility. In the future, based on the results of investigation and research, some problems should be systematically and specifically solved. At present, special attention should be paid to those areas with barren land and poor people, and the fraternal ethnic groups should be helped step by step and in a planned way to improve agricultural, animal husbandry, and handicraft production, so as to achieve a gradual improvement in their material lives on the basis of developing production. The basic construction in ethnic minority areas must be carried out with a focus on the overall national construction, with emphasis on areas with a foundation and conditions first. This will prevent the dispersal of the country's construction forces; dispersed forces are not conducive to helping ethnic minorities develop.

    Finally, he gave instructions on some existing problems in ethnic work. When talking about the issues of respecting the customs, habits, and religious beliefs of fraternal ethnic groups and respecting the authority of ethnic minority cadres, he said: The reform or non-reform of customs and habits should be decided by the ethnic group itself. Forced interference is a violation of policies and laws. Discrimination against fraternal ethnic groups and contempt for the authority of fraternal ethnic minority cadres are the most serious manifestations of Han chauvinism and must be exposed and corrected. Ethnic minorities should boldly criticize those bad cadres, and at the same time, those good cadres who correctly implement policies, work hard, and achieve results should be praised and rewarded.

    The meeting finally adopted the "Basic Summary Draft on Animal Husbandry Production in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Some Pastoral Areas in Suiyuan, Qinghai, and Xinjiang" and the "Basic Summary Draft on the Experiences in Promoting Ethnic Regional Autonomy," and decided to submit them to the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government for review.

    中央民族事务委员会举行会议
    总结民族区域自治等经验
    【新华社八日讯】中央人民政府民族事务委员会第三次（扩大）会议，于今年六月间在北京举行。这次会议的主要收获，是总结了各地推行民族区域自治的经验和内蒙古自治区及绥远、青海、新疆等地若干牧业区畜牧业生产的经验。同时，会议就各少数民族的选举问题，也作了较详细的讨论。参加这次扩大会议的有中央人民政府民族事务委员会委员，各大行政区和多数省、市民族事务委员会以及中央一级各有关部门负责人等共一百二十多人。
    在会议上，中央人民政府民族事务委员会副主任委员张执一作了时事报告，副主任委员刘格平作了中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会选举法中关于各少数民族的选举问题的传达报告；副主任委员乌兰夫、汪锋分别报告了“关于内蒙古自治区及绥远、青海、新疆等地若干牧业区畜牧业生产的基本总结草案”及“关于推行民族区域自治经验的基本总结草案”。
    会议在听取上述报告后，对每个报告都进行了较细致的讨论。会议认为“关于内蒙古自治区及绥远、青海、新疆等地若干牧业区畜牧业生产的基本总结草案”和“关于推行民族区域自治经验的基本总结草案”都很好。从“关于内蒙古自治区及绥远、青海、新疆等地若干牧业区畜牧业生产的基本总结草案”中，不仅可以看出畜牧业经济是我国新民主主义经济的一个组成部分，发展畜牧业生产是发展牧业区经济、改善牧业区各族人民生活、解决牧业区民族问题的基本内容，也是国家工业化和发展农业生产不可缺少的部分。同时，从总结草案中还可以看出，我们国家对畜牧业生产的领导，已经有了一套较完整的政策和成熟的经验。畜牧业生产在我国发展是有广阔前途的。从“关于推行民族区域自治经验的基本总结草案”中，可以看出我国在推行民族区域自治方面，已获得了很大的成绩，并获得了许多经验。总结草案中所提出的必须在一切工作中充分地估计各少数民族的特点和具体情况；必须加强、巩固民族间和民族内部的团结；必须逐步地使自治机关民族化；必须帮助自治区适当地行使其自治权利和必须在可能条件下尽力发展政治、经济、文化事业，目前特别注意发展农业和牧业生产等经验，对已经成立自治区和还没有实行民族区域自治的地方，都会有很大的帮助。自然，这些经验不能到处硬搬，应该根据各地不同的具体情况应用。
    在会议上，各委员、各大行政区和各省、市民族事务委员会的负责人在发言中，对自己所在地区民族工作的情况和经验都作了介绍；对目前民族关系方面存在的主要倾向——大汉族主义倾向，作了无情的揭发和批判；对发展各少数民族的政治、经济、文化事业，也提出了许多具体要求和建设性的意见。
    中央人民政府民族事务委员会主任委员李维汉在会议上作了重要的发言。他指出这次会议的收获是很大的，并就民族自治区自治权利问题和民族自治区建设问题作了扼要的说明。他着重指出：今后的民族工作将逐步与过去几年有所不同了。过去几年，民族工作主要是政治工作。现在，虽然各地区情况不一样，有若干地区主要的还是政治工作，但民族工作的总的趋势，将从以政治工作为主逐渐转到政治工作和经济文化建设特别是改进和发展生产工作都应重视。这是一个新的任务。为此，就需要做许多基本的调查研究工作，每个地区的干部和每个民族自治区的领袖都应该重视这个工作，担负起这个责任。今后根据调查研究的结果，应有系统地专门地解决一些问题。在目前，尤应注意那些地瘠民贫的地区，有步骤有计划地帮助兄弟民族改进农业、牧业和手工业生产，以便在发展生产的基础上获得物质生活的逐步改进。少数民族地区的基本建设则必须从整个国家建设着眼，有重点地进行，首先从有基础有条件的地区开始。这样才不致分散国家建设的力量；力量分散，对帮助少数民族发展是不利的。
    最后，他对民族工作中存在的一些问题作了指示，谈到尊重兄弟民族风俗习惯、宗教信仰和尊重少数民族干部职权的问题时，他说：风俗习惯等的改革或不改革，应由本民族自己决定，如果强迫干涉，是违反政策和法令的。歧视兄弟民族和蔑视兄弟民族干部的职权，这是大汉族主义最严重的表现，必须揭发和纠正。少数民族应该大胆地批评那些不好的干部，同时对于那些正确执行政策，艰苦工作而有成绩的好干部则应给他们以表扬、奖励。
    会议最后通过“关于内蒙古自治区及绥远、青海、新疆等地若干牧业区畜牧业生产的基本总结草案”及“关于推行民族区域自治经验的基本总结草案”，并决议提请中央人民政府政务院审核。
