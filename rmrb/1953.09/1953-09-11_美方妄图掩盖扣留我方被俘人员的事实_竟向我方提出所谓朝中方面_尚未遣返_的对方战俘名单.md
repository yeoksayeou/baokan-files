Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 9th: At the Military Armistice Commission meeting on the 9th, the U.S. side presented a list of 3,100 American prisoners of war allegedly "not yet repatriated" by the Korean-Chinese side. The U.S. fabricated this list, the purpose of which is obviously to divert the world's attention and conceal the fact that the U.S. is still forcibly detaining a large number of Korean-Chinese prisoners of war. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles publicly admitted at a press conference in Denver on the 7th: "I don't know of any evidence to prove that they (referring to the Korean-Chinese side) are holding any American prisoners of war." This proves that the U.S. list is completely fabricated out of thin air.

In fact, the U.S. has overturned its promise to repatriate all prisoners of war who insisted on repatriation without exception and has so far forcibly detained a large number of Korean-Chinese prisoners of war. After U.S. Secretary of the Army Stevens publicly announced that 250 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war would be held as hostages, the U.S. only repatriated 138 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war. Therefore, at least 112 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who insisted on repatriation are still being detained by the U.S. In the list of 644 Korean People's Army prisoners of war submitted by the Korean-Chinese side to the U.S. side who were forcibly detained by the U.S. side, after careful verification, 228 people have not yet been repatriated.

According to a United Press report from Busan on the 5th, the U.S. transported a ship of Korean-Chinese prisoners of war from Busan on September 5th. The news said, "They will not arrive at the Incheon and Panmunjom exchange stations until Sunday (6th) evening at the earliest." But the U.S. ended the repatriation work at noon on the 6th. Where did this last ship of Korean-Chinese prisoners of war go? Why hasn't the U.S. repatriated them yet?

Countless returned prisoners of war from our side have repeatedly confirmed that in the last moments before the repatriation of prisoners of war, the U.S. and the Syngman Rhee troops used poison gas bombs, bayonets, and the death penalty to threaten Korean-Chinese prisoners of war to give up their right to repatriation. These facts fully prove that the U.S. has consistently and deliberately forcibly detained Korean-Chinese prisoners of war.

Observers here also pointed out that another purpose of the U.S. in fabricating this list is to conceal the fact that it has not made any effort to recover these prisoners of war after the Syngman Rhee group forcibly detained more than 27,000 of our prisoners of war. Chief Representative of the Korean-Chinese Delegation to the Korean Armistice Negotiations, General Nam Il, pointed out as early as July 19th that the U.S. has the full responsibility to recover all forcibly detained prisoners of war and provide an explanation to our side at any time. If the U.S. still cannot recover these prisoners of war and hand them over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission after the armistice, the Korean-Chinese side reserves the right to submit this issue to a political conference for discussion. However, there is no indication so far that the U.S. is prepared to recover these prisoners of war.

Observers also pointed out that the purpose of the U.S. in presenting this fabricated list is also to divert people's attention and conceal its silence on the protests raised twice by the Korean-Chinese side regarding the U.S. support for Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee bandit secret agents' activities in the prisoner of war camps. The reason why the U.S. avoids answering our protests is that it is continuing to support and assist Chiang and Rhee secret agents in carrying out activities in the prisoner of war camps, plotting to undermine the smooth execution of its mission by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, to achieve their sinister purpose of forcibly detaining our prisoners of war. Tomorrow, the first batch of prisoners of war who will not be directly repatriated will be handed over by the U.S. to the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. The whole world is watching the U.S.'s actions in supporting and assisting Chiang and Rhee secret agents in infiltrating the prisoner of war camps and carrying out conspiracies.

### 美方妄图掩盖扣留我方被俘人员的事实  竟向我方提出所谓朝中方面“尚未遣返”的对方战俘名单

    美方妄图掩盖扣留我方被俘人员的事实
    竟向我方提出所谓朝中方面“尚未遣返”的对方战俘名单
    【新华社开城九日电】在九日军事停战委员会会议上，美方提出一份所谓朝中方面“尚未遣返”的美方战俘三千一百人的名单。美方捏造这份名单，目的显然在于转移全世界的注意力，掩盖美方直到现在仍然强迫扣留大批朝中被俘人员的事实。美国国务卿杜勒斯七日在丹佛举行的记者招待会上曾公开承认：“我不知道有什么证据，足以证明他们（按指朝中方面）扣留着任何美国战俘。”这就证明了美方的这份名单完全是无中生有、杜撰出来的。
    事实上，是美方推翻了它所作的将无例外地遣返一切坚持遣返的战俘的诺言，迄今仍然强迫扣留了大批朝中被俘人员。在美国陆军部长斯蒂文斯公开宣布将扣留中国人民志愿军被俘人员二百五十人作为人质以后，美方只遣返了中国人民志愿军被俘人员一百三十八人。因此，至少有一百一十二名坚持遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员仍被美方扣留着。在朝中方面提交美方的被美方强迫扣留的朝鲜人民军被俘人员六百四十四人的名单中，经过仔细核对，有二百二十八人尚未被遣返。
    据美国合众社五日自釜山报道，九月五日美方从釜山运走一船朝中被俘人员。这条消息说，“他们最早也要在星期日（六日）晚才能到达仁川和板门店交换站”。但美方在六日中午就结束了遣返工作，这最后一船朝中被俘人员到那里去了？美方为什么迄今仍然不把他们遣返？
    无数已归来的我方被俘人员已一再证实，在遣返战俘前的最后一刻，美方与李承晚部队还用毒气弹、刺刀和死刑，威胁朝中被俘人员放弃遣返的权利。这些事实充分证明了美方一贯蓄意强迫扣留朝中被俘人员。
    此间观察家并指出：美方捏造这个名单的另一个目的，是为了掩饰它在李承晚集团强迫扣留我方被俘人员二万七千多人以后，并未作任何努力来追回这些战俘。朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团首席代表南日大将早在七月十九日即已指出：美方对于被强迫扣留的战俘在任何时候都负有全部追回并向我方提出交代的责任。如果在停战后，美方尚不能将这批战俘追回交给中立国遣返委员会，朝中方面保留将这个问题提交政治会议讨论。但是，迄今没有任何迹象证明美方准备追回这些战俘。
    观察家并指出：美方提出这份捏造的名单，目的还在于转移人们的注意，掩饰它对朝中方面两次提出的关于美方支持蒋介石、李承晚匪帮特务在战俘营内活动的抗议所采取的沉默的态度。美方所以避不答复我方抗议，是因为它正在继续支持和协助蒋李特务在战俘营中进行活动，预谋破坏中立国遣返委员会顺利执行其任务，以达到他们强迫扣留我方被俘人员的罪恶目的。明天，第一批不直接遣返的战俘将由美方移交中立国遣返委员会看管。全世界都在注视着美方支持并协助蒋李特务混入战俘营进行阴谋活动的行为。
