　　Jinan City, Licheng County, Qingdao City in Shandong Province, Hefei City, Feixi County in Anhui Province, Minhou County in Fujian Province, Yongji County in Jilin Province, Fengcheng County in Liaodong Province, Dianjiang County in Sichuan Province, Heng County in Guangxi Province, and Dalian City, among other places, have conducted trial implementation work for universal suffrage people's courts as universal suffrage pilot projects were carried out.

    The establishment of the universal suffrage people's courts effectively guaranteed the people's freedom to exercise their political rights, truly enabling universal suffrage to achieve "not allowing a single reactionary element or a landlord class element whose composition has not been changed to illegally steal solemn political rights," and "not allowing a single citizen to be wrongly deprived of solemn political rights" (Deng Xiaoping: Explanation of the Draft of the "Election Law of the National People's Congress and Local People's Congresses of the People's Republic of China"). In the eleven townships of Licheng County, Shandong Province, where pilot work for basic-level universal suffrage was carried out, a total of 56 election litigation cases were accepted, of which 49 involved voter eligibility, 4 involved class status disputes, 2 involved cadres violating laws and regulations, and 1 involved a hidden local bully. The universal suffrage people's courts carefully tried all 56 cases. Staff members of the universal suffrage people's courts in Hefei City and Feixi County, Anhui Province, went deep into the electorate to assist voter groups and election committees in resolving difficult issues related to voter eligibility review. For example, some voter eligibility review groups in Guanyi Township, Feixi County, had mistakenly classified people with physiological defects such as deafness, muteness, and stuttering as mentally ill, wrongly depriving them of their voter eligibility. After discovering these situations, the universal suffrage people's court staff assisted the local election work committee in quickly correcting this deviation. In another instance, the Eighth District Election Work Committee of Chengde County, Rehe Province, had wrongly deprived farmer Sun Jingwang of his voter eligibility, claiming that he had hired long-term laborers and bought rubber-wheeled carts after the land reform. Sun Jingwang filed a complaint with the universal suffrage people's court regarding this act of infringing on his political rights. After investigation, the universal suffrage people's court proved that Sun's complaint was correct and that he should be granted the right to vote.

    At the same time, the universal suffrage people's courts promptly dealt with elements disrupting the election movement, ensuring the smooth development of the universal suffrage work. In Erzicun, Chengdong Township, Dianjiang County, Sichuan Province, hidden counter-revolutionary element Peng Wenxian deliberately created and instigated disunity among cadres. In Guangxing Township, Shehong County, landlord class element Zhang Wencheng, who had not been reformed, destroyed dikes during the universal suffrage, releasing water to wash away the cadres' cotton fields. The local universal suffrage people's court promptly convened a public trial to prosecute the elements disrupting the universal suffrage movement and gave them criminal punishments in accordance with the provisions of the Election Law. In the Bianmen District of Fengcheng County, Liaodong Province, the universal suffrage people's court sanctioned Luo Zhaoli for disrupting the election movement, supporting the masses and taking charge of their affairs. The universal suffrage people's courts also paid attention to preventing certain grassroots cadres from obstructing and suppressing democracy.

    With the establishment of universal suffrage people's courts, various localities paid attention to the training of people's assessors. In Qingdao, Xi'an, and other places, when electing members of the voter eligibility review groups, a group of people with prestige among the masses were selected to serve as assessors. They played a positive role in helping to hear cases related to voter eligibility litigation.

    Recently, the Ministry of Justice of the Central People's Government conducted research on the work of universal suffrage people's courts in various localities. According to reports from the universal suffrage people's courts in Minhou County, Fujian Province, Hefei City, Anhui Province, and Licheng County, Shandong Province, an average of three to five election-related cases per township were tried by the people's courts, and a county handles approximately 300 cases during the universal suffrage period. According to the provisions of the Election Law, these cases should be handled within about twenty days. As the election work gradually unfolds in various localities, it is expected that the number of cases will increase. This is an arduous task. Therefore, people's courts in various localities should attach importance to the establishment of universal suffrage people's courts.

    济南、合肥、凤城等地试办普选人民法庭
    保证了普选运动的顺利开展
    山东省济南市、历城县、青岛市，安徽省合肥市、肥西县，福建省闽侯县，吉林省永吉县，辽东省凤城县，四川省垫江县，广西省横县及旅大市等地，随着普选典型试办工作的开展，进行了普选人民法庭典型试办工作。
    普选人民法庭的建立，有效地保障了人民自由行使其政治权利，真正使普选达到“不能听任一个反动分子或未经改变成分的地主阶级分子非法窃取了庄严的政治权利”，“也不能听任一个公民被错误地剥夺了庄严的政治权利”（邓小平：关于“中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会选举法”草案的说明）。山东省历城县基层普选试验工作的十一个乡，共受理选举诉讼案五十六件，其中有四十九件涉及到选民资格问题，关于成分纠纷的四件，有关干部违法乱纪的两件，有关漏网恶霸的一件。对于这五十六个案件，普选人民法庭都作了慎重的审理。安徽省合肥市、肥西县普选人民法庭的工作人员，深入选民群众，协助选民小组和选举委员解决有关选民资格审查的疑难问题。如肥西县管驿乡某些选民资格审查小组曾错误地把生理上有聋、哑、口吃等缺陷的人都列为精神病患者，错误地剥夺了他们的选民资格。普选人民法庭工作人员发现这些情况后，便协助当地选举工作委员会迅速纠正了这一偏向。又如热河省承德县第八区选举工作委员会曾错误地剥夺了农民孙景旺的选民资格，说他在土地改革后曾雇过长工，买过胶皮轮大车。孙景旺向普选人民法庭控告了这一侵犯政治权利的行为。普选人民法庭经过调查，证明了孙的控告是对的，应给予他选举权。
    同时，普选人民法庭及时地处理了破坏选举运动的分子，保障了普选工作的顺利开展。四川省垫江县城东乡二字村在基层普选中，漏网反革命分子彭文贤故意制造和挑拨干部间的不团结；射洪县广兴乡未经改造的地主阶级分子张文成，在普选中破坏水堤，放水冲毁干部的棉田，当地普选人民法庭及时召开大会公审了破坏普选运动的分子，并按选举法规定给他们以刑事处分。在辽东省凤城县边门区，普选人民法庭制裁了破坏选举运动的罗兆礼，给群众撑了腰，做了主。普选人民法庭也注意到防止某些基层干部妨害与压制民主的行为。
    随着普选人民法庭的建立，各地注意了人民陪审员的培养。青岛、西安等地，在选举选民资格审查小组的人员时，物色了一批在群众中有威望的人担任陪审员。他们在帮助审理有关选民资格诉讼事件等方面，起了良好的作用。
    最近中央人民政府司法部就各地普选人民法庭的工作情况进行了研究。根据福建省闽侯县、安徽省合肥市、山东省历城县普选人民法庭的报告，每乡经人民法庭审理的有关选举的案件平均有三件到五件，而一个县在普选期间受理的案件约有三百件。按选举法的规定，这些案件均应在二十天左右处理完毕。选举工作在各地逐步展开后，预计案件的数字还会增多。这是一个繁重的任务。因此，各地人民法院对建立普选人民法庭问题应引起重视。
