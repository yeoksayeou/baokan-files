    Reading "The Works of Qu Yuan"
    Annotated by Wen Huaisha, published by People's Literature Publishing House
    Zang Kejia
    Due to the improvement of political consciousness and economic conditions, the level of cultural life of the Chinese people is also rising rapidly, and therefore a strong interest has naturally developed in those valuable literary heritages. However, there is now a barrier of language between the general public and classical literature. No matter how strong people's subjective wishes are, it is impossible to break into the artistic realm created by ancient poets and writers. Under these circumstances, the work of interpreting classical literary works has become an urgently needed bridge.
      "The Works of Qu Yuan" is an attempt at such work. Qu Yuan was the first great poet to appear in the history of Chinese literature, and has had a great influence on the development of Chinese literature for more than two thousand years. On the eve of commemorating the 2,230th anniversary of his death, Comrade Wen Huaisha presented his work as a gift to young people who love literature and art, which is very meaningful. His efforts and the direction of his efforts should be affirmed.
    Annotating the works of an ancient great poet like Qu Yuan in vernacular language is an extremely heavy task, requiring great learning and strong perseverance to overcome numerous obstacles. Comrade Wen Huaisha has worked hard to overcome many difficulties and has achieved certain results.
    Today, there is a convenient condition for organizing Qu Yuan's works, which is that there are achievements of previous research that can be referred to. However, conversely, it can also become a disadvantageous condition. There are nearly a hundred scholars in ancient and modern times who have studied Qu Yuan, and they all speak differently. Where to go? This requires the person engaged in this work to have insight and the ability to grasp materials, to be able to delve into them and at the same time transcend them, not to be overwhelmed by the materials. Comrade Wen Huaisha obviously has achievements in this regard. This is reflected in several aspects: Qu Yuan's works, due to the long age, inevitable errors in words and sentences, wrong chapters and redundant sentences. Comrade Wen Huaisha deleted the sentences that were generally recognized as being mistakenly added by later generations, such as "Said, 'Let's meet at dusk,' but then changed the road halfway" in "Li Sao." In addition, many words and sentences were decided after careful consideration. These sentences have existed in the old books for many years, but today they have changed their appearance in "The Works of Qu Yuan." For example:
      In the sentence "Come, I will guide you on the road" ("Li Sao"), Wang Yi's "Chu Ci Zhang Ju," Zhu Xi's "Chu Ci Ji Zhu," and Jiang Ji's Shandaige Annotation "Chu Ci" do not have the word "ye." Comrade Wen Huaisha added the word "ye" from Wen Yiduo's "Chu Ci School Supplement."
    "Five sons lost in the alleys of their homes" ("Li Sao"), changed to "Five sons used their husbands in the alleys of their homes" according to Wang Niansun's statement.
    There is a sentence in "Li Sao": "Who believes in Xiu and admires him?" According to the fact that the word "admires" does not rhyme and the meaning is difficult to understand, Guo Moruo and Wen Yiduo both raised questions and put forward opinions. Comrade Wen Huaisha abandoned all the old sayings and wrote it as "Who believes in Xiu and Mo □ it." The "□" character indicates a missing word, and in the annotation, he quoted Mr. Guo Moruo's statement: "'Admires' is a miscombination of the two characters 'Mo' and 'Xin,' and 'Xin' is used as a verb." This cautious attitude is good. Some words and sentences originally had multiple explanations. The annotator adopted one after careful consideration, but also wrote the other one at the back for reference. This attitude is also good. For example, the word "Neng" in the sentence "Also doubled with Xiu Neng" ("Li Sao") is annotated as "beautiful talent." Then it says "Some people think it is a beautiful appearance. Because the ancient characters of 'Neng' and 'Tai' are interlinked." Of course, the corrections made to the words and sentences are not limited to these. These are just examples cited from "Li Sao."
    When selecting one from the various theories, the attitude of Comrade Wen Huaisha is generally not sloppy, which can be seen from the treatment of the poem "Mountain Ghost." The personal pronoun of "Mountain Ghost" is a very troublesome issue, which can be said to be different for everyone. Those who have studied Qu Yuan are very clear about this complex situation. Comrade Wen Huaisha said in "Qu Yuan Jiuge Jin Yi" that "I have repeatedly paid attention to it, seeking to be more appropriate in the performance." He abandoned some statements that took "Jun" as King Chu, and intentionally adopted Mr. Pu Jiangqing's statement that the whole poem was a self-narration by the mountain ghost. Finally, he consulted Mr. Guo Moruo and finally abandoned Mr. Pu Jiangqing's opinion and made it the way it is in this collection. (The "Mountain Ghost" he translated is also like this.) From this point, we can see the spirit and painstaking effort of the annotator who made the decision to take or leave after consideration.
    Another advantage of this collection is reflected in the generality and conciseness of the theme interpretations. For example, the theme interpretation of "Li Sao" begins by introducing the explanations of the word "Li Sao" by various families in the past, and then says: "This lyrical long poem is Qu Yuan's most outstanding work, describing the pursuit and disillusionment of a depressed soul, going up to the sky and down to the earth, driving dragons and using birds. Through rich imagination and clever metaphors, he expresses his feelings of homesickness and love for the country, and the pain of separation and death." This is a quite appropriate introduction to this masterpiece and the spirit and personality of its creator, and the language itself has a strong lyrical flavor. Furthermore, the explanation of each section of "Li Sao" also has the same advantages, which is of great help to readers in understanding the meaning of the poem in this section. The annotation text of this collection is mainly vernacular, which is equivalent to opening the door to the field of classical literature for general readers.
    Although "The Works of Qu Yuan" has the above advantages, these advantages cannot hide some of the errors and many shortcomings it has.
    The most problematic part of this collection is the annotation part (of course, broadly speaking, punctuation marks are also a kind of explanation added to it by the author). Now let's start from here.
      There is a sentence in "Ai Ying": "Passing Xiashe and floating westward," Wang Yi's annotation is: "Floating from the west and traveling eastward." Mr. Guo quoted another sentence from this article, "Turning his back on Xiapu and thinking westward," as an example to confirm that "floating westward" means "thinking westward while the boat travels eastward" (in "Qu Yuan Fu Jin Yi," "east" is mistakenly planted as "west"). According to the direction of Qu Yuan's exile route, this is very correct. However, Comrade Wen Huaisha annotated "floating westward" as "drifting westward." "Drifting westward" was advocated by Dai Zhen and Jiang Ji. Comrade Lin Geng is also like this. However, they all explained the reasons in the notes. Dai said: "Passing Xiashe and tracing back..." Jiang said: "Where the boat travels in a winding path, the road has a southwest direction," and Comrade Lin Geng also noted: "There is an island in the middle of the river, and the river flows southwest below the island," meaning the same: the general direction is eastward, but because the river flows in a winding path, it floats westward here. Comrade Wen Huaisha only says "drifting westward" without adding conditions, which is wrong. The sentence immediately following this one is: "Looking at Longmen and not seeing it." Under the word "looking," the two words "turning around" are noted, which is also wrong. (Dai and Jiang both noted it as "looking," which is understandable.) Comrade Wen Huaisha interprets "floating westward" as the boat traveling westward, which is exactly towards "Longmen," so why "turn around"?
    Regarding the personification in "Mountain Ghost," opinions have always been divided, so let's not worry about it. Comrade Wen Huaisha annotated the "mountain dweller" in the last paragraph of "Mountain Ghost," "Mountain dweller, fragrant Du Ruo," and the "Jun" in "You think of me and then hesitate," as "Mountain Ghost," which is a bit difficult to understand in terms of meaning. If "mountain dweller" refers to "Mountain Ghost," then the word "Jun" should refer to her lover. The sentence before "Mountain dweller, fragrant Du Ruo" is: "You think of me and have no leisure." Mr. Guo Moruo's translation is:
    "Resent you, good brother,
    You are probably still thinking of me,
    But you are not free,
    Aren't you hiding from me?" ("Qu Yuan Fu Jin Yi")
    "Jun" is obviously "good brother." The sentence patterns before and after are roughly the same. Following the previous example, "You think of me and then hesitate" should be interpreted as "good brother" to be more appropriate. In the same sentence, Comrade Wen Huaisha's annotation of the two words "ran yi" as "However, hesitation has occurred" is also inappropriate. (Although some predecessors have regarded "ran" as a transitional word.) "Ran yi," Hong Xingzu's annotation is very clear: "Ran means no doubt; yi means not yet." Mr. Wen Yiduo said more clearly in "Chu Ci School Supplement": "Ran yi is like saying 'dubious' today." "Are you thinking of me, which is really confusing," this explanation can be consistent with the suspicious and bewildered state of mind of the "Mountain Ghost" who "thinking of the young man and being sad."
    Comrade Wen Huaisha's interpretation of "great disaster" for "serious illness" in "fear of suffering from serious illness and leaving especially" in "Xi Song" is also incorrect. "Chong" should be a verb here. Wang Yi annotated it as "suffering from disaster again"; Hong and Zhu annotated it as "increasing." Comrade Wen Huaisha may have mistaken it for the "great" "chong," so it is annotated as "greater." In this way, the word "chong" changes from a verb to an adjective. There are similar examples. The word "qi" in "fish covering its scales to distinguish itself" ("Bei Hui Feng"), Wang, Jiang and Mr. Guo all interpret it as a verb. According to the meaning of this sentence, this is correct. However, Comrade Wen Huaisha annotated "fish covering its scales" as "a fish with layered scales," which is obviously taking the verb as an adjective again. There are similar examples. The word "ci" in "returning to Qiongshi at night" ("Li Sao"), Wang, Zhu, and Jiang all said "shelter," Wang explained in detail "Staying two nights is a letter, and passing the letter is a secondary." Mr. Guo Moruo also translated it as "spending the night," all as verbs, but Comrade Wen Huaisha annotated it as "a place to live," treating it as a noun.
    Today, the most difficult and most careful issue in annotating classical literary works is: "Synthesizing all opinions and choosing the good ones." (Of course, it is more necessary to express one's own opinions.) When considering the pros and cons, Comrade Wen Huaisha is not very sloppy, but he has not reached a very strict degree. This is evident in the handling of the sentence "Nü Wa's Chan Yuan" ("Li Sao"). For the two words "Chan Yuan," Comrade Wen Huaisha abandoned the general opinion and took Mr. Wen Yiduo's statement alone. Mr. Wen quoted Wang Yi's view to interpret "Chan Yuan" ("Chuan Huan") as "breathing hard when emotionally tense." Comrade Wen Huaisha popularized it as "panting," which was originally correct, but Mr. Wen said after quoting this sentence and the next sentence "Shen Shen scolding me": "This is anger and panting." Comrade Wen Huaisha took Wen's saying but canceled the word "anger" and replaced it with the word "jiao" (which may be taking the general saying to interpret "Chan Yuan" as kind and tactful), becoming "娇喘吁吁的样子" (嬌喘吁吁的樣子 - a panting appearance), which completely changed the meaning of the sentence.
    Others, such as interpreting "sorrowful person, what can I do" ("Da Si Ming") as "a person who is worried"; interpreting "I will let my mind wander and be happy" ("Si Mei Ren") as "get rid of my mind"; interpreting "What changes can be made" (ibid.) as "What things can be done to change conduct?"; interpreting "Where can the wandering stop" ("Bei Hui Feng") as "how can it stop"; interpreting "the blind thought there was no light" ("Huai Sha") as "did not see clearly"; interpreting "the emperor's destiny is not pure" ("Ai Ying") as "heaven with a soul"; interpreting "not measuring the chisel and straightening the handle" ("Li Sao") as "handle"; ("handle" - "the end of the carved wood to enter the chisel") interpreting "?" in "punished by the soup and blowing ?" ("Xi Song") as "things eaten like sauce"... ("凡醢醬所和細切為?，一曰搗蒜辛物為之" - Generally, sauces and fine cuts are made into ?, one is made by pounding garlic and spicy things) are incorrect or not precise enough.
    The same words and phrases are used in different places, and therefore have different meanings and should be interpreted differently, which is correct. However, there are examples in this collection where the meaning of words and sentences in one article is completely the same, but the annotations contradict each other:
    "Pity that Yongjun is not bright"
    "Pity that Yongjun is not knowledgeable" ("Xi Wang Ri")
    The meaning and grammatical organization of these two sentences are exactly the same. Comrade Wen Huaisha's annotation of "Yongjun" in the latter sentence as "the deceived monarch" is correct, but the "Yongjun" in the former sentence is annotated as "the monarch was deceived." Others, such as annotating "Kui Pingxin and Lizhi" in "Li Sao" as "encountering this," and interpreting "Wei Quemei and Lizhi" in another sentence in the same article as "persisting until now," although it cannot be said to be wrong, the meaning can be explained in the same way (Mr. Guo's translation is like this).
    In this collection, some sentences are very clear without annotation, and the annotation makes them unclear. The word "zhi" in the sentence "It is not what my heart desires" ("Xi Song") is annotated as: "'Zhi' is what the heart is set on. The so-called purpose of the heart is the purpose of thinking. 'Not my heart's desire' means it is not what I am concerned about in my heart."
    Regarding the annotation text in this collection, Comrade Wen Huaisha set a standard for himself in the preface: "Clear and easy to understand." In fact, some parts were achieved, but some parts were far from it. Please see the following examples to know:
    "Retreat and be silent" ("Xi Song") - "Take a step back and be quiet and silent";
    "Why did Peng Xian create thoughts?" ("Bei Hui Feng") - "Why about the ancient sage Peng Xian's thoughts?";
    "'The same goal' (referring to relying on King Chu)";
    "The sadness of leaving Yingdu is getting farther and farther away";
    "Hoping to have a place to live but unable to find a place";
    "Describing a very distant meaning";
    "No one is more loyal to the king than me"...
    There are more or less shortcomings in the grammar of some of these sentences, and these shortcomings can be avoided by careful consideration.
    Organizing Qu Yuan's works is a great project, and there must be a strict system. Which words and sentences can be unannotated, and which ones must be annotated; which words must be annotated with pronunciation, and which ones can be unannotated, there should be at least a standard. One of the serious shortcomings of this collection is the inconsistency of the system and the lack of a certain standard. "Mi, confusion"; "Hao, love"; "Liang, food"; "Bo, sowing"; "Fang, fragrance"... These words that even elementary school students can understand at a glance are annotated all over the paper, and some are annotated again and again; words and sentences that need detailed annotation to make the meaning clear are passed over lightly. For example, "Qing Jiang" in "Yin Wei Shan to Qing Jiang" in "Bei Hui Feng," Mr. Guo Moruo translated it as "examine the Yangtze River," which is correct when compared with "Feng Kunlun to Kan Wu" in the previous sentence, "Kan Wu." Comrade Wen Huaisha took Wang and Jiang's saying "Qing Qi Liu" and annotated it as "clarifying the river water," which made the observation of the real scene take on a "symbolic" meaning. Wang Yi clearly said: "Wanting to clear away evil," and Jiang Ji also said "Life cannot correct its country but death still wants to clear its flow." Comrade Wen Huaisha did not explain at all, but only annotated it as "clarifying," so that readers do not understand what its meaning is?
    The annotation of pronunciation in this collection is even worse. For many unfamiliar words that must be annotated, such as "軑, 薋, ?, 絓, 惂, 汋..." the pronunciation is not annotated at all. Occasionally, the minority is annotated with pronunciation. Some of them are annotated, but it is actually equivalent to not annotating: "剡, sound Yan." I think those who do not know the word "剡" may not know the word "琰." Taking the "supplementary note" at hand brings trouble to the reader.
    The lack of work planning and the inconsistency of the system are not only reflected in the annotations and pronunciation, but also in the theme interpretations (in the theme interpretation of "Li Sao," various interpretations of the word "Li Sao" are quoted, so why not quote the explanations of these two general topics in the theme interpretations of "Nine Songs" and "Nine Chapters"? How exactly is the word "Nine" explained? This is originally a number, but why are there eleven poems in "Nine Songs"? I think the general reader will have such questions.) It is not only reflected in the theme interpretations, but also in the division of the main text and the appendix.
    Mr. Guo Moruo's "Qu Yuan Fu Jin Yi" does not include the article "Yuan You." Comrade Wen Huaisha also said that it "has too much Taoist spirit," which is obviously not like Qu Yuan's work, but it is still placed together with "Zhao Hun" and "Tian Wen." The copyright of "Tian Wen" has never been questioned, so it is placed in the appendix, simply because the annotation is difficult. Of course, it is more troublesome to annotate this article, but based on Guo's translation, and referring to the research results of predecessors, Wen's "Chu Ci School Supplement" and "Tian Wen Shi Tian," it can generally be understood. As it is now, putting it naked in the appendix is not equal to spreading a book of heaven in front of the general reader? "Bu Ju" and "Yu Fu" can be kept in the appendix, but they should also be annotated uniformly (Mr. Guo also translated these two works).
    There is another shortcoming in this collection, that is, there are many typos; "沬" is mistaken for "沫", "氾" is mistaken for "汜", "齐吴榜以击汰" is mistaken for "齐吾榜以击伏", and two words are misspelled in a six-character ancient poem! Compared with this, the occasional typos in the small notes are nothing. (In the last line of page 67 of this collection, "永" is always mistaken for "求".)
    As mentioned above, this collection refers to the sayings of various scholars and strives to be correct in terms of word and sentence textual research. This effort is commendable. But there are still some places that experts believe are wrong or redundant, and Comrade Wen Huaisha did not consider them. Even if he does not agree, he should explain them. The first paragraph of "She Jiang" can be used as a relatively prominent example.
    Because I respect Comrade Wen Huaisha's work, and also because I want to learn from it, I carefully read this collection. The above is a little bit of my opinion after reading it. Because I respect it, I also demand it strictly. Annotating Qu Yuan's works is like exploring a towering peak, so mistakes are inevitable. I hope that Comrade Wen Huaisha can make up his mind and start this work again, remove all the shortcomings, and make it a popular and perfect good book. With Comrade Wen Huaisha's previous research achievements and experience, and more meticulous and careful work, I think it will be done well.

    读“屈原集”
    文怀沙注　人民文学出版社出版
    臧克家
    我国人民，由于政治觉悟的提高、经济情况的改善，文化生活的水平也在急速上升，因而对于那些文学上的宝贵遗产自然发生了浓厚的兴趣。可是，现在一般群众和古典文艺之间隔着一层文字的障碍，不管人们的主观愿望怎样强烈，也无法突进古代诗人、作家们所创造的那艺术境界里去。在这种情况下，古典文艺作品的解释工作便成为一道迫切需要的桥梁。
      “屈原集”便是这样工作的一种尝试。屈原是出现在中国文学史上的第一个伟大诗人，对于两千多年来我国文学的发展发生过极大的影响，在纪念他逝世二千二百三十周年前夕，文怀沙同志把他工作的成绩作为一份礼物献给一般爱好文艺的青年，这是很有意义的，他的努力和努力的方向都是应该肯定的。
    把屈原这样一位古代大诗人的作品加以语体文字的注解，是极为烦重的一项工作，需要极大的学力、极坚强的毅力去突破重重的障碍。文怀沙同志努力克服了许多困难，取得了一定的成绩。
    今天整理屈原的作品有一个便利的条件，那便是有前人研究的成果，可以参考，但是反转过来，它又可以成为一个不利的条件。古今研究屈原的将近百家，众口哓哓，何去何从？这就需要从事这工作的人，有见识，有掌握材料的能力，能深入同时又能超出，不被材料所淹没。文怀沙同志在这方面，显然是有成就的。这表现在好几方面：屈原作品，因年代久远，字句错讹，错篇衍句，在所难免。文怀沙同志把公认是后人误增的句子删去了，例如“离骚”里的“曰黄昏以为期兮，羌中道而改路”。此外，有许多字句是经过斟酌而后作了决定，这些句子在旧本子里存在了许多年，今天在“屈原集”中却改变了面貌。例如：
      “来吾导夫先路”（“离骚”）一句，王逸的“楚辞章句”，朱熹的“楚辞集注”，蒋骥的山带阁注“楚辞”都没有“也”字，文怀沙同志从闻一多先生的“楚辞校补”添了“也”字。
    “五子用失乎家巷”（“离骚”），从王念孙说改成为“五子用夫家巷”。
    “离骚”里有一个句子：“孰信修而慕之”，按“慕”字既不协韵，义又难通，郭沫若、闻一多先生均发生疑问，提出意见，文怀沙同志抛开一切旧说，把它写成“孰信修而莫□之”，“□”字表示缺字，而在注解中引郭沫若先生的说法：“‘慕’字即‘莫心’二字的误合，‘心’作动辞用”，这种谨慎的态度是好的。有些字句，本来有多种讲解，注者斟酌采用了一种，但把另一种也写在后边供人参考，这种态度也是好的。例如“又重之以修能”（“离骚”）句中的“能”字，注为“美好的才能”。接下去又说“有人以为是美好的仪态。因为能态古字相通”。对字句方面所作的订正，当然不只这些，这仅是从“离骚”一篇里引来的例证。
    在从诸家的说法里去选定一种的时候，文怀沙同志所持的态度大体上说也还不苟且，这可以从对“山鬼”一诗的处理上看出来。“山鬼”的人称代名词是一个十分麻烦的问题，可以说是言人人殊，这种复杂情况，研究过屈原的人都十分清楚。文怀沙同志在“屈原九歌今绎”中说“我曾经反复致意，求其在表现上比较妥贴”，他舍弃了以“君”为楚王的那一些陈说，有意于浦江清先生全篇皆山鬼自述的说法，最后又请教了郭沫若先生，终于放弃了浦江清先生的意见，作成本集现在的这个样子。（他绎的“山鬼”也是如此。）从这一点上可以看出注者经过考虑而决定取舍的精神和苦心。
    本集另外的一个优点，表现在题解的概括性、简明性上。譬如“离骚”的题解，开始介绍了历代各家对“离骚”二字解说之后，接着说：“这首抒情长诗，是屈原最为杰出的作品，描写一个苦闷的灵魂的追求与幻灭，上天下地，驱龙使鸟。通过丰富的想像和巧妙的比喻，抒写着怀乡爱国之情，生离死别之痛。”这颇为恰当的介绍了这篇杰作和它的创作者的精神与人格，文字本身抒情的风味也很浓厚。再如“离骚”每节的解释也有同样的长处，对于读者了解本节的诗意有很大的帮助。本集的注解文字，主要的是语体，这对于一般读者等于推开了走向古典文学领域的大门。
    “屈原集”虽然具有以上这些长处，但这些长处却掩盖不了它本身所具有的一些错误和许多缺点。
    这个集子里问题最多的是注解部分，（当然，广义的讲，标点符号也是作者加给它的一种解释）现在我们就从这儿谈起。
      “哀郢”里有一个句子：“过夏首而西浮兮”，王逸注：“从西浮而东行”。郭先生引本篇另一句“背夏浦而西思兮”为例，确证“西浮”为“心思向西而船行向东”，（“屈原赋今译”中“东”误植为“西”）按屈原流亡路线的方向，这是十分正确的。而文怀沙同志把“西浮”注作“往西漂浮”。“往西漂浮”，戴震、蒋骥就曾这么主张过，林庚同志也是如此。但他们都在注中说明了理由。戴说：“过夏首复溯洄……”，蒋说：“舟行之曲处，路有西南向者”，林庚同志也注明：“有江心洲，洲以下江流西南折”，意思都是一样的：大方向是向东，因江流曲折，此处是向西浮。文怀沙同志只说“往西漂浮”，并不附加条件，这是不对的。这一句下面紧接着的一句是：“顾龙门而不见”，在“顾”字下面，注了“回头”两个字，这又是错误的。（戴、蒋均注为“望”，是可以讲得通的）文怀沙同志既把“西浮”解为船行向西，那正好朝著“龙门”，何用“回头”？
    对于“山鬼”里的人称，历来意见纷纭，且不去管他。文怀沙同志把“山鬼”末段“山中人兮芳杜若”中的“山中人”和下面“君思我兮然疑作”中的“君”都注作“山鬼”，这在意义上就有点讲不大通。如果“山中人”是指“山鬼”，那么这个“君”字应当是指她的爱人。“山中人兮芳杜若”前面的一句是：“君思我兮不得闲”，郭沫若先生的译句是：
    “怨恨你呵，好哥哥，
    你怕依然在想我，
    只是没空闲，
    不是把我躲？”（“屈原赋今译”）
    “君”显然是“好哥哥”。前后的句法大致相合，以前例后，“君思我兮然疑作”中的“君”，当作“好哥哥”讲才比较合适。同句中“然疑”两个字，文怀沙同志注为“然而发生了迟疑”也是不妥当的。（虽然前人也有把“然”当作转折辞的）“然疑”，洪兴祖注得很明白“然，不疑也；疑，未然也”，闻一多先生在“楚辞校补”中说得更明白：“然疑犹今言将信将疑”。“你是否在想念我呵，这真叫人迷惑”，这么解释才可以和“思公子兮徒离忧”的“山鬼”的狐疑迷惘的精神状态相吻合。
    文怀沙同志把“惜诵”里“恐重患而离尤”中的“重患”解作“更大的灾患”也是不对的。“重”在这儿应该是动词，王注为“重得患祸”；洪、朱都注作“增益”，文怀沙同志也许把它错看做“重大”的“重”，所以注成“更大的”，这样，“重”字就由动词一变而为形容词了。类似的例子还有。“鱼葺鳞以自别兮”（“悲回风”）中的“葺”字，王、蒋和郭先生都作动词解，按本句的意思，这是对的。而文怀沙同志却把“鱼葺鳞”注作“就是披着层鳞的鱼”，显然又是把动词当做形容词了。类似的例子还有。“夕归次于穷石兮”（“离骚”）中的“次”字，王、朱、蒋都曰“舍也”，王并详解曰“再宿为信，过信为次”，郭沫若先生也把它译作“过夜”，都作动词解，而文怀沙同志注作“住的地方”，把它当作了名词。
    今天从事注解古典文艺作品，最困难、最需要慎重处理的问题是：“综合众说，择善而从”。（当然更需要独抒己见。）在斟酌去取时，文怀沙同志虽然不太苟且，但还没达到十分谨严的程度。这在对“女?之婵媛兮”（“离骚”）这个句子的见解的处理上表现得很显明。“婵媛”二字，文怀沙同志摒弃一般的意见，独取了闻一多先生的说法。闻先生是申引了王逸的见解把“婵媛”（“嘽喛”）解作“情绪紧张时的喘息”的，文怀沙同志把它通俗化作“喘吁吁的样子”原来是不错的，但闻先生在引了本句和紧接的下一句“申申其詈予”之后说：“此怒而喘息也”，文怀沙同志取闻说却取消了这个“怒”字而代之以“娇”字，（可能是采取一般的说法，把“婵媛”解作亲切、委婉的意思）成为“娇喘吁吁的样子”，把这个句子的意味弄得完全不同了。
    其他如把“愁人兮奈何”（“大司命”）中的“愁人”解作“忧愁的人”；把“吾将荡志而愉乐兮”（“思美人”）中的“荡志”解作“摆脱心志”；把“何变易之可为”（同上）解作“有那一件改变操行的事可以做呢？”；把“驰委移之焉止”（“悲回风”）中的“焉止”解作“怎能停止”；把“瞽以为无明”（“怀沙”）中的“无明”解作“没有看清”；把“皇天之不纯命兮”（“哀郢”）中“皇天”解作“有灵魂的天”；把“不量凿而正柄兮”（“离骚”）中的“柄”解作“柄子”；（“柄”——“刻木端所以入凿”）把“惩于羹而吹?兮”（“惜诵”）中的“?”解作“酱之类食用的东西”……（“凡醢酱所和细切为?，一曰捣蒜辛物为之”）都是不正确或不够确切的。
    同样的字眼用在不同的地方，因而就会有不同的意义，应该作不同的解释，这是对的。但在本集中却存在着一篇之中字句意义完全相同而注解却相互矛盾的例子：
    “惜壅君之不昭”
    “惜壅君之不识”（“惜往日”）
    这两个句子的意义和文法组织完全是一个样子，文怀沙同志把后句中的“壅君”注成“被蒙混的君王”是不错的，而前一句中的“壅君”却被注成“是君王被蒙蔽了”。其他如把“离骚”里“喟凭心而历兹”中的“历兹”注为“遭遇如此”，将同篇中另一句“委厥美而历兹”的“历兹”解作“坚持到现在”，虽不能说是错，但在意义上是可以作同样解释的（郭先生的翻译就是这样）。
    在这个集子里，有的句子本来不加注解是很清楚的，加了注解反而不清楚了。“亦非余心之所志也”（“惜诵”）一句中的“志”字被注作：“‘志’，就是心有所之。所谓心有所之的意思就是思考的目的。‘非余心之所志’，就是不是我内心所顾虑的。”
    关于本集里的注解文字，文怀沙同志在序言里给自己树立了一个标准：“明白易晓”，实际上，一部分是做到了，一部分却差得多。请看下面的例子便会知道：
    “退静默”（“惜诵”）——“退后一步，且安静而且沈默”；
    “夫何彭咸之造思兮”（“悲回风”）—“为什么对于古贤彭咸的设想”；
    “‘同样的目标’（指靠楚王的这一点上）”；
    “悲哀离开郢都一天比一天远了”；
    “希望有一个容身之处而找不到处所”；
    “形容很遥远的意思”；
    “思念君王没有比我更忠诚”……
    像这样一些句子，在文法上都多多少少存在着缺点，而这些缺点，只须用心推敲一下就可以避免了的。
    整理屈原作品是一件伟大的工程，一定要有严密的体制，哪些字句可以不注，哪一些却非注不可；哪些字一定要注音，哪一些可以不注，起码应该有一个标准。本集的严重的缺点之一就是体例不统一、没有一定的标准。“迷，迷惑也；“好，爱好也”；“粮，粮食也”；“播，播种也”；“芳，芳香也”……这样一些连小学生也可以一目了然的字注得满纸皆是，有的还一注再注；需要详加注解才能使意义畅晓的字句，反而被轻轻带了过去。譬如“悲回风”里“隐?山以清江”中的“清江”，郭沫若先生译为“细察长江”，与上句“冯昆仑以瞰雾兮”中的“瞰雾”比照，是正确的，文怀沙同志取了王、蒋“清其流”的说法，注为“澄清着江水”，这就使得对于现实景物的观察，带上了“象征”的意味。而王逸却明说：“欲清澄邪恶”，蒋骥也说“生不能正其国而死犹欲清其流”，文怀沙同志却完全不加说明，只注为“澄清着”，使读者不明白它的意义到底何在？
    本集注音的情况更是糟糕。对于像“軑、薋、?、絓、惂、汋……”等等许多必须注音的陌生字全不注音，偶然想到似的，被注音的少数而又少数。有的虽然注了音，实际上却等于不注：“剡，音琰”，我想不认识“剡”字的也未必认识这个“琰”字。顺手取了“补注”，却给读者带来了麻烦。
    工作计划性的不强，体例的不统一不但表现在注解上、注音上，也表现在题解上，（在“离骚”的题解里，引了诸家对“离骚”二字的各种解说，在“九歌”、“九章”的题解里为什么不引各家对于这两个总题目解说？“九”字到底怎么讲？这本是一个数目字，但为什么“九歌”里有十一篇诗呢？我想一般读者会发生这样疑问的。）不但表现在题解上，同样也表现在正篇和附篇的划分上。
    “远游”一篇，郭沫若先生的“屈原赋今译”不收，文怀沙同志也说它“道士气太重”，显然不像屈原的作品，但还是把它和“招魂”、“天问”放在一道。“天问”的著作权从来不曾发生过问题，所以被放在附篇里去，仅仅是因为注解困难。这篇东西，注解起来当然比较麻烦，但以郭译为主，再参考前人研究成果、闻先生的“楚辞校补”、“天问释天”，大体上还是可以弄明白的。像现在这样，把它赤条条地摆在附篇里，不等于在一般读者眼前摊开一篇天书吗？“卜居”、“渔父”，是可以留在附篇里的，但也应该一律注解（郭先生也同样翻译了这两篇作品）。
    本集还有一个缺点，就是存在不少错字；把“沬”错成“沫”，把“氾”错成“汜”，把“齐吴榜以击汰”错成“齐吾榜以击伏”，一句六言古诗中，竟然错上两个字！小注里的个把错字比较起来就算不得什么一回事了。（本集第六十七页末行，“永”远误为“求”远。）
    上面说过，本集在字句考订方面，参考诸家的说法，力求正确，这种努力是可贵的。但还有些地方，专家们认为是错简或衍句的，文怀沙同志并未加以考虑，即使不从，也应该加以说明，“涉江”的首段可以作一个比较突出的例子。
    因为尊重文怀沙同志的这份工作，也因为自己要向它学习，所以精心的读了这个集子，以上就是我读后的一点意见。因为我尊重它，所以要求得也严格。给屈原的作品作注解，好像向摩天的高峰探险，因而失误也是在所难免的。希望文怀沙同志能下个决心，重新开始这项工作，去掉一切缺点，使它成为通俗完美的一本好书。凭文怀沙同志以往研究的成绩和经验，更加严密精心的去从事这工作，我想一定会做得好的。
