The Central Ministry of Agriculture recently issued a "Notice on Ensuring the Cotton Harvest," the full text of which is as follows:

    During July and August, continuous rain in Hebei, Henan, Shandong, and the Northeast caused cotton plants to grow excessively, with a lot of boll shedding and boll rot, reducing yields and delaying maturity. The recent severe flooding in major cotton-producing areas of Shandong and parts of Hebei, coupled with drought in the Guanzhong cotton region of Shaanxi due to lack of rain, has made it difficult for cotton fields across the country to achieve planned per-unit-area yields. Furthermore, the cotton planting area is six million mu less than originally planned, resulting in a significantly lower total yield than last year. This will inevitably affect the supply of cotton for textiles. Therefore, ensuring the cotton harvest has become a crucial task at present: (1) In flood-stricken areas, efforts should be made to drain water vigorously, adhering to the spirit of "save every mu that can be saved, save every plant that can be saved." Cotton plants that have fallen over after water has been drained should be propped up. Appropriate weeding and hoeing should be carried out to promote early boll opening. (2) Overgrown cotton fields should continue to be pruned. (3) Drought-affected cotton fields in Shaanxi's Guanzhong and other areas should be irrigated with small amounts of water, seizing the time without affecting late maturity. (4) Continue to prevent and control pests such as cotton leaf rollers, armyworms, and cotton bollworms. (5) In single-cropping cotton areas, early plowing for autumn crops in past years led to premature removal of stalks, affecting yields. This year, due to abundant rain and late maturity, stalks can be removed and autumn plowing carried out after the frost, in order to harvest as much cotton as possible.

### 中央农业部通知各地力保棉花收成

    中央农业部通知各地力保棉花收成
    中央人民政府农业部最近发出了“力保棉花收成”的通知，全文如下：
    七、八月间，河北、河南、山东、东北霪雨连绵，棉株疯长，落铃烂铃很多，产量降低，成熟延迟，山东主要棉区及河北部分棉区最近水灾严重，陕西关中棉区又缺雨干旱，以致全国棉田难以完成单位面积计划产量，加以棉田面积较原计划减少六百万亩，总产量将比去年大大减少。势必影响纺织用棉的供应。因此，力保棉花收成已成为当前重要工作：（一）水灾地区应在“保一亩收一亩，保一株收一株”的精神下赶紧大力排水；已排出积水的棉田，要设法扶起倒伏棉株。并适当进行锄耪，促使成铃早日开絮。（二）疯长的棉田，应继续整枝。（三）陕西关中等地受旱棉田，在不影响晚熟的条件下抓紧时间，进行小水灌溉。（四）继续防治卷叶虫、造桥虫、棉铃虫等的为害。（五）历年在一熟棉区，因赶早秋耕，拔秸偏早，影响产量。今年由于雨多晚熟，可于枯霜后拔秸赶行秋耕，以尽可能地多收获一些棉花。
