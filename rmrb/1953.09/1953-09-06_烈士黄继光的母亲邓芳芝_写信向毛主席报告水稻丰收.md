    Martyr Huang Jiguang's Mother, Deng Fangzhi, Writes a Letter to Chairman Mao Reporting a Bumper Rice Harvest

    Respected Chairman Mao:

    This year my rice harvest, like everyone else's, has been bountiful, and I am very happy. Although my 2.4 mu of paddy field are all on earthen slopes, I learned advanced techniques such as "sparse sowing of seeds," "sparse seedlings and dense planting," and "rational fertilization," and I did a good job of weeding and pest control. As a result, the rice was not beaten into the mud by heavy wind and rain, there were no empty ears, and there were very few weeds. On August 19th, my rice field was completely harvested, yielding an average of 750 jin per mu, an increase of 11% over last year. The mu participating in the patriotic bumper harvest competition even yielded 801 jin. Why was my rice harvest so bountiful this year? It is because you led us peasants to liberate ourselves and we have our own land. It is because you taught us peasants that increasing production is for building the motherland and defending world peace. Furthermore, it is also because you, old man, educated my son Huang Jiguang into a hero, which makes me feel very honored. In order to maintain this honor and strive for even greater glory, I feel energetic in everything I do.

    Now, I have stored one shi of "clean, clean, and full" grain and am preparing to take the lead in paying "patriotic grain." I will also work actively to close the winter water gates, plow the fields well, carry out winter stem borer control, and prepare vigorously for autumn planting. This year I plan to plant 3.5 mu of wheat and 0.3 mu of rapeseed. The wheat seeds will be "Zhongda 2419," and I will soak them in warm water before sowing. At the same time, I will do a good job of water storage to guard against "winter drought" so that I can sow at the right time. In the future, I will continue to do a good job of intertillage, weeding, and seedling protection to strive for a bumper harvest next year.

    Respected Chairman Mao: I will often use these practical actions to thank you and actively support the construction of the motherland and strive for world peace!

    I wish you good health!

    Deng Fangzhi

### 烈士黄继光的母亲邓芳芝  写信向毛主席报告水稻丰收

    烈士黄继光的母亲邓芳芝
    写信向毛主席报告水稻丰收敬爱的毛主席：
    今年我的水稻也和大家一样丰收了，我心头很高兴。我那二亩四分水稻田虽然都是土坡地，但是我学习了“稀撒谷种”、“少秧密栽”、“合理施肥”等先进经验，又做好了除草、除虫工作，因此稻谷没有被大风雨打入泥水中，没有白吊吊，稗草也少得很。八月十九日，我的稻田收割完毕，平均每亩收了七百五十斤，比去年增产百分之十一；参加爱国丰产竞赛的那一亩还收了八百零一斤。我今年的水稻为什么能够丰收呢？这是因为您领导我们农民翻了身，我们有了自己的田地；因为您教育我们农民懂得了增加生产是为了建设祖国，保卫世界和平。此外，还因为您老人家把我儿子黄继光教养成一个英雄，使我感到十分光荣；为了保持这个光荣，并争取更大的光荣，我做起活来浑身都有劲。
    现在，我已把一石“一干二净三饱满”的谷子收藏好，准备带头交纳“爱国粮”。我还要积极劳动，把冬水关好、田犁好，进行冬季治螟，并加劲准备秋种。今年我准备点三亩五分麦子，栽三分油菜。麦种选用“中大二四一九”，播种时要用温汤浸种；同时要做好蓄水工作，提防“冬干”，以便适时播种。今后，我还要随时做好中耕除草、保苗工作，争取明年的丰收。
    敬爱的毛主席：我要经常拿这些实际行动来感谢您。并积极支援祖国建设工作，为争取世界和平而奋斗！
    祝您身体健康！
