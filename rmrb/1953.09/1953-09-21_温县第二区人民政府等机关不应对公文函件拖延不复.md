    The Wen County Second District People's Government and Other Agencies Should Not Delay Responding to Official Letters and Correspondence

    A letter from Cheng Shi, People's Court of Wuchang District, Wuhan City: During the judicial reform movement last year, our court re-examined some cases and needed to investigate materials in other places. We respectively requested relevant agencies to conduct nearby inquiries on our behalf. Thanks to the vigorous assistance of most of the relevant agencies, the vast majority of cases have been successfully concluded. However, some agencies delayed dealing with our letters, resulting in some cases that have not yet been closed. For example, in December of last year and January of this year, our court sent letters to the Second District People's Government of Wen County, Henan Province (formerly Pingyuan Province) and the Fancheng Branch of Hubei Provincial Transportation Company, respectively, to inquire about certain situations nearby. However, the above-mentioned agencies have not yet sent the materials to us, nor have they replied to us. This attitude of refusing to handle official letters from agencies is wrong. We hope they will immediately change their work style and take the initiative to check the work of handling official letters from agencies and letters from the people.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    温县第二区人民政府等机关不应对公文函件拖延不复
    武汉市武昌区人民法院诚实来信：我院在去年司法改革运动中所复查的部分案件需要到外地调查材料，就分别转请有关机关代为就近查询。由于多数有关机关的大力协助，绝大部分案件已胜利结案。但也有些机关对我们的信件拖延不理，致使一部分案件至今不能结案。如去年十二月和今年一月我院曾分别函请河南省温县（原平原省）第二区人民政府和湖北省运输公司樊城分公司就近了解某些情况，但上述机关直到现在还没有把材料寄来，也不给我们回信。这种对待机关公函采取拒绝处理的态度是不对的。希望他们立即改变作风，主动地检查一下处理机关公函和人民来信的工作。
