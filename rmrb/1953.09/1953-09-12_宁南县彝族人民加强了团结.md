Reader's Letters Abstract:

    Yi People of Ningnan County Strengthened Unity

    Reader Guo Ping writes: Half of the people in Ningnan County, Xikang Province, are Yi people. The Yi people live in groups on high mountains, based on "matou" (wharf), and lived a very poor life under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang in the past. Due to the instigation of Kuomintang Han chauvinists and reactionary rulers of their own ethnicity, there were many disputes within the Yi people; "feuds" were formed between "matou", and even between brothers, and they did not communicate with each other and often engaged in armed fights.

    More than a year after liberation, the Yi people established their own regime and established an autonomous region and six autonomous townships. Under the brilliant illumination of Chairman Mao's ethnic policy, the "feuds" left over from the past have slowly been resolved.

    Li Dezhen (Yi ethnicity), the deputy head of Pigu Yi Autonomous Township, had a "feud" with his younger brother under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. After liberation, his political awareness gradually increased. When he participated in mediating disputes among the Yi people in February this year, he sincerely expressed his willingness to reconcile with his younger brother; at that time, his younger brother was moved to tears. Brothers who had not dared to meet for many years sincerely united! Many people were moved on the spot, and then eight pairs of "feuds" were successfully reconciled.

    At present, there are forty to fifty Yi cadres in Ningnan County in the same situation as Li Dezhen who are actively working for the happy life of their ethnic people.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    宁南县彝族人民加强了团结
    读者郭萍来信：西康省宁南县全县有一半是彝民。彝民们以“码头”为单位聚居在高山上，过去在国民党反动统治下过着十分贫穷的生活。由于国民党大汉族主义者和本族反动统治者的挑拨离间，彝民内部纠纷很多；各“码头”之间、甚至亲弟兄之间结成了“冤家”，双方互不往来，还经常械斗。
    解放后一年多，彝族人民建立了自己的政权，成立了一个自治区和六个自治乡。在毛主席民族政策的光辉照耀下，过去遗留下来的“冤家”纽结，已经慢慢地解开了。
    皮古彝族自治乡副乡长李德贞（彝族）在国民党反动统治下和弟弟结了“冤家”。解放后，他的政治觉悟逐渐提高了。今年二月他参加调解彝民之间的纠纷时，就诚挚地表示愿意和他弟弟重新和好；当时他弟弟被感动得流下泪来。多年不敢见面的弟兄真诚地团结起来了！当场许多人都感动了，接着就有八对“冤家”顺利地重新和好了。
    目前宁南县已有四、五十个和李德贞同样情况的彝族干部在为本民族人民的幸福生活而积极工作着。
