Experiences in Wheat Procurement Work in Xinxiang Special District
The CCP Xinxiang Local Committee

Editor's Note: The Xinxiang Special District of Henan Province completed 99% of its annual wheat procurement task in June, July, and August, an increase of 170% over the total procurement last year. This is a significant achievement. At present, the procurement of wheat is still in progress, and the procurement of autumn grain has also begun. All localities should learn from the experience of Xinxiang Special District, improve grain procurement work, and ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the state grain procurement plan.

This year, the grain procurement work in Xinxiang Special District of Henan Province has achieved great results. According to statistics as of August 25th: a total of 59,090,000 catties of various grains were purchased in June, July, and August, including 55,910,000 catties of wheat, completing 199% of the annual procurement task, an increase of 170% compared with the total procurement in 1952. At the same time, the production materials supplied to farmers: 3,590 waterwheels, 5,070,000 catties of chemical fertilizers, 12,240,000 catties of cake fertilizer, 1,553 new-style farm implements, 74,690 catties of various pesticides, as well as livestock, old-style farm implements, etc., totaled more than 25.5 billion yuan in value, equivalent to more than 140% of the same period last year; the total value of livelihood materials sold, such as cloth, coal, grain, oil, general merchandise, and sugar, was more than 90.3 billion yuan, an increase of 105% compared with the same period last year.

The reason for the success of the procurement work in Xinxiang Special District is that the Party Committee strengthened the political and ideological leadership and policy leadership of financial and economic work, conducted in-depth inspections and provided concrete assistance to the work, and achieved unified thinking, unified planning, and unified forces. Due to the preliminary criticism of the "departmentalism" between state-owned trading companies and cooperatives in the past and the strengthening of policy concepts, this year's grain procurement work, led by the state-owned economy and with cooperatives as the backbone, established 1,298 points and mobile teams combining purchase and sale throughout the district with the participation of nearly 4,000 economic workers, active in the vast urban and rural markets. Purchase at the points on market days and go to the countryside to purchase on non-market days; every cooperative, procurement point, and township conducts procurement; achieving both purchase and sale simultaneously. Therefore, the farmers said with emotion: "The grain station is set up in our village, and the goods are delivered to our home. We don't have to go to the market to sell wheat, and we don't have to rush to the fair to buy things. We have never seen such a good government in our lives." Hu Jingkui, a farmer in Shanbiao Township, Jixian County, sold 400 catties of wheat to the cooperative and bought 150 catties of soybean cake, 30 catties of fertilizer powder, applied it to three mu of cotton fields and three mu of autumn fields, and bought fine cloth and red and white sugar that were not easy to buy in the past. He said happily: "If the wheat procurement didn't come to our village, I wouldn't have bought so much or sold so much." Because farmers can buy production and livelihood materials in a timely and convenient manner after selling wheat, the listing volume and procurement ratio of wheat have been rapidly increased. In early June, the average daily procurement was 50,000 catties, and in late June it increased to 900,000 catties. The proportion of procurement increased from 35.6% of the listed wheat to 92.7%, ensuring that most of the wheat was procured by the state.

Another reason for the good performance of wheat procurement in Xinxiang Special District is the good work of supply and marketing. The key to ensuring good supply and marketing work lies in conducting typical investigations, going deep into the business process, and understanding the farmers' thoughts and demands. According to the actual situation, on the one hand, measures are taken to "obtain materials locally and supply them locally" in combination with procurement from other places; on the other hand, state-owned trading companies support cooperatives, and cooperatives organize handicraft processing as much as possible, organize the farmers' own forces, and open up sources of goods through multiple channels to meet the farmers' needs as much as possible. At the beginning, due to the existence of conservative thinking, the supply plan was generally low and far from the farmers' purchase and sale requirements. In the actual work, through typical investigations, the cadres' thinking was improved, and they realized the purchase and sale characteristics of the small-peasant economy of "selling for the sake of buying." Only by continuously revising the plan, organizing the source of goods, and catching up with the supply according to the actual situation can the farmers be stimulated to sell grain enthusiastically. For example, the Special District Textile Company originally planned to supply 60,000 bolts of cotton cloth throughout the year, but by the end of August, it had supplied 71,809 bolts, accounting for 345% of the supply in the same period last year; in order to meet the peak season supply of autumn harvest, it is now increased to 140,000 bolts in the annual plan. More than 70% of the cake fertilizer supplied by cooperatives is processed by handicraft production cooperatives and handicraft workshops; more than 40,000 pieces of old-style farm implements are all manufactured locally, of which more than 50% are finely made by handicraft production cooperatives. Fangzhuang Joint Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Xiuwu County, in carrying out the delivery of goods to the countryside in conjunction with the procurement of wheat, knew that farmers mainly needed production materials after selling wheat, and the most urgently needed production material was livestock. In order to meet the farmers' requirements, they mobilized the farmers to take out funds, selected representatives, and formed a joint group led by cooperative cadres to lead them to purchase livestock in other places. They bought back three batches of livestock, a total of 214 heads, and led the masses to organize themselves to buy back 481 heads of livestock. In addition, they also supplied the farmers with 77 hoes, 261 ploughshares, 20 ploughshares, 46 iron pots, more than 12,000 catties of chemical fertilizers, and more than 7,000 feet of calico, which promoted the smooth progress of wheat procurement work. From the end of June to July 20, a total of 315,900 catties of wheat were purchased, and 90.3% of the annual procurement plan was completed in less than a month. Precisely because of this, the relationship between Fangzhuang Joint Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the masses is closer than before, and they have fulfilled their responsibility to meet the needs of the country and industry.

Combining the purchase and sale work with the organized farmers is an important part of doing a good job in purchase and sale. In Xiuwu County, 173 agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams collectively sold wheat, accounting for 11.3% of the total wheat purchased in the county, and bought a large number of production and livelihood materials. After the wheat harvest, the Jia Liangde mutual aid team in En Village, Xiuwu County, fulfilled the "combination contract" and sold 3,195 catties of wheat to the cooperative (accounting for 22% of the wheat harvest). After selling wheat, the cooperative supplied 1.13 million yuan of fertilizer and 490,000 yuan of livelihood materials, and repaid the loan of 1.73 million yuan. A mutual aid team in Baijian Village, Jiyuan County, sold 16,000 catties of wheat in one go. Under its influence, the listing volume increased threefold, which not only promoted the procurement of wheat, but also strongly supported production, consolidated the mutual aid team, and laid a material foundation for increasing grain production.

    新乡专区收购小麦工作的经验
    中共新乡地方委员会
    编者按：河南省新乡专区在六、七、八三个月中，完成全年收购小麦任务的百分之九十九，比去年收购总数增加百分之一百七十，这个成绩是很显著的。目前收购小麦的工作还在继续进行，收购秋粮的工作也已展开。各地应吸取新乡专区的经验，改进购粮工作，保证完成和超额完成国家购粮计划。
    河南省新乡专区今年的购粮工作取得了很大成绩。据八月二十五日统计：六、七、八月份共收购各种粮食五千九百零九万斤，其中小麦五千五百九十一万斤，已完成全年收购任务的百分之一百九十九，较一九五二年度收购总数增加百分之一百七十。与此同时，供应到农民手中的生产资料：水车三千五百九十部，化学肥料五百零七万斤，饼肥一千二百二十四万斤，新式农具一千五百五十三部，各种农药七万四千六百九十斤，以及牲口、旧式农具等总值二百五十五亿多元，等于去年同期的百分之一百四十以上；销售出纱布、煤炭、粮食、油脂、百货、糖等生活资料总值九百零三亿多元，比去年同期增加百分之一百零五。
    新乡专区收购工作取得成绩的原因，是由于党委加强了对财经工作的政治思想领导和政策领导，深入检查和具体帮助工作，做到了统一思想，统一计划，统一力量。由于初步批判了过去国营贸易公司与合作社相互之间的“本位主义”，加强了政策观念，今年粮食收购工作以国营经济为领导、合作社为骨干，全区在近四千个经济工作者参加下，设立购销结合的点和流动小组一千二百九十八个，活跃在广大城乡市场上。逢集日点上收，不是集日下乡收；每个合作社、收购点、乡都进行收购；作到一手收购，一手供应。因此农民感动地说：“粮站设咱村，送货到咱家，卖麦不上集，买东西不赶会，人活几辈子也没见这样好的政府。”汲县山彪乡农民胡景奎卖给合作社四百斤小麦，买了一百五十斤豆饼，三十斤肥田粉，上了三亩棉花地，三亩秋地，买了过去不易买到的细布、红白糖等，他高兴地说：“要不是收麦到咱村，说什么也不会买的多，卖的多。”由于农民在出卖小麦后，能够及时方便地买到生产、生活资料，带动了小麦上市量和收购比例的迅速增加。六月初旬平均每日收购五万斤，下旬增加到九十万斤，收购比重相对由占上市小麦百分之三十五点六，增加到百分之九十二点七。保证了大部分小麦为国家收购。
    新乡专区购麦工作做得好的另一个原因，是供销工作做得好。保证做好供销工作的关键在于通过典型调查，深入经营过程，摸清农民思想和要求。根据实际情况，一方面，采取“就地取材，就地供应”，与外地采购相结合的办法；另方面，国营贸易公司支持合作社，合作社尽可能组织手工业加工，组织农民自己的力量，多头多路地开辟货源，尽可能满足农民的要求。开始由于存在着保守思想，供应计划普遍偏低，和农民购销要求相差甚远，在实际工作中通过典型调查，提高了干部思想，认识到小农经济“为买而卖”的购销特点，只有根据现实情况，不断修正计划，组织货源，供应赶上，才能刺激农民踊跃卖粮。如专区花纱布公司，原计划全年供应棉布六万匹，到八月底止供应了七万一千八百零九匹，占去年同期供应的百分之三百四十五；为了迎接秋收旺季供应，现提高到全年计划十四万匹。合作社供应的饼肥中百分之七十以上是靠手工业生产合作社和手工业作坊加工的；四万多件旧式农具全部是就地制造，其中百分之五十以上是手工业生产合作社精制的。修武县方庄联村供销社在开展送货下乡结合收购小麦中，经过深入访问，知道农民卖麦后主要是需要生产资料，生产资料中最迫切需要的是牲口。为了满足农民要求，就发动农民自己拿出资金，选出代表，由合作社干部负责组成联合组，领导他们外出采购，买回牲口三批共二百一十四头，带动群众自己组织起来买回牲口四百八十一头。此外，还供应了农民锄头七十七张，犁铧二百六十一个，犁面二十个，铁锅四十六口，化学肥料一万二千多斤，花布七千多尺，推动了小麦收购工作的顺利进行。自六月底开始到七月二十日止，共收购小麦三十一万五千九百斤，不满一月就完成了全年收购计划百分之九十点三。正因为如此，方庄联村供销合作社和群众的关系也较前密切，对满足国家和工业的需要也尽到了自己的责任。
    把购销工作与组织起来的农民相结合，是做好购销工作的重要一环。修武县在收购小麦中，有一百七十三个农业生产合作社和互助组，集体出卖小麦占该县收购小麦总数的百分之十一点三，买走了大批的生产、生活资料。修武县恩村贾良德互助组麦收后履行“结合合同”，卖给合作社小麦三千一百九十五斤（占小麦收获量百分之二十二），卖麦后由合作社供应了一百一十三万元肥料，四十九万元的生活资料，归还了贷款一百七十三万元。济源县白涧村一个互助组一次卖麦一万六千斤，在它影响下，上市量增加三倍，不但推动了收购小麦，并且有力地支持了生产，巩固了互助组，给增产粮食打下了物质基础。
