    Farmers in Various Places Actively Prepare for Autumn Cultivation and Planting
    Party and Government Leading Organs Attach Importance to This Year's Wheat Planting Work
    [From Our Newspaper] Farmers in East China, Northwest China, Central and South China and other places, under the leadership of local Party and government organs, are preparing for autumn cultivation and planting, and some areas have already started autumn cultivation. Now farmers are busy repairing agricultural tools, matching cattle for plowing, exchanging for improved varieties, and preparing fertilizers.
    In the East China region, the fourth district of Jining County, Shandong Province, has repaired 1,800 plows and harrows, and matched 1,200 head of livestock for plowing. Farmers in five townships in Pingyi and other counties have purchased 139 head of cattle. Farmers in Zhongxindian Township, Zouping County, have added four new carts and 17 head of cattle. In order to maintain soil fertility, most areas are plowing while harvesting. In the LinYi, Tai'an, Heze, and Jining prefectures, 60% to 90% of sorghum and millet stubble fields have been plowed. BaiLing Township of LinYi County, through calculating time, draught animals, and land, reversed the thinking of cadres and farmers that "it's not too late if the ground is wet," enabling all 170 draught animals in the township to go to the fields for plowing, and plowing 1,460 mu of land in four days. The eleventh district of JuNan County is leading farmers to improve the soil during autumn cultivation. Party and government leading organs at all levels in Shandong Province attach great importance to this year's wheat planting work. The Provincial People's Government and various special commissioner's offices have promptly issued instructions on autumn planting; Tai'an, ChangWei, WenDeng and other prefectures have also held symposiums on wheat high-yield with the participation of labor models, summarizing and exchanging experiences in selecting improved varieties and wide-row close planting. Supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels have made early preparations for the supply of agricultural tools and fertilizers to help farmers increase grain production. The Provincial Cooperative General Agency recently transferred 7 million jin of chemical fertilizers from Dalian and other places to various places. Cooperatives in LaiYang and ChangWei prefectures have prepared 78.76 million jin of soybean cake and cottonseed cake, 32 million jin of chemical fertilizers, 3,000 walking plows, and 2,000 waterwheels. Local cooperatives also organized local handicraftsmen to process a large number of small farm tools such as hoes, shovels, iron harrows, shovel heads, and harrow teeth. LaiYang and LinYi prefectures alone processed and manufactured more than 400,000 small farm tools of various types. According to the opinions of cooperative members, the LaiYang Prefectural Cooperative has sent people to Inner Mongolia to purchase 10,000 head of cattle.
    In early September, Jiangsu and Anhui provinces had a timely rain. Now, in the areas of the Jianghuai Plain where the rain has thoroughly soaked the ground, farmers are actively replanting late autumn crops and storing water to prevent drought. In areas of Jiangsu Province where early autumn crops have been harvested, the soil could not be plowed due to drought, but the soil is now loose and wet after the rain. At present, farmers in both provinces are actively preparing for wheat planting.
    The wheat seeds needed for autumn planting in the wheat-producing areas of East China provinces have been prepared. Zhejiang and Fujian provinces had a bumper harvest of summer wheat, and there is generally no problem with seeds. Farmers in Shandong Province also have no major difficulties with wheat seeds. According to a typical survey in Xuecheng County, the seeds lacking by farmers only account for 5% of the required amount. Most farmers in Anhui and Jiangsu provinces have retained wheat seeds. The seeds lacking by farmers can be solved locally in each province. Most farmers retaining wheat seeds and the ability to solve seed shortages locally not only guarantees timely autumn planting, but also greatly benefits increasing wheat production next year because local seeds are adapted to local soil and climate conditions.
    State-owned farms in East China have prepared a large number of improved varieties to promote them to farmers within an appropriate scope. Improved varieties selected by farmers themselves during the summer harvest will also be promoted locally through exchanges and other means. At present, various places are mobilizing farmers to dry wheat seeds, and grain departments are also drying the seeds prepared for supply to ensure germination rate and reduce pests.
    In order to summarize and exchange the experience of high-yield winter wheat in various parts of the Northwest this year, and study ways to improve winter wheat planting technology in the Northwest region, and lay a good foundation for increasing wheat production next year, the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau of the Northwest Administrative Committee recently convened the Northwest Region Winter Wheat Production Technology Conference. Based on the high-yield experience and existing problems in various parts of the Northwest this year, the meeting determined several major opinions on improving wheat farming technology. First, in terms of rational crop rotation and increased fertilization, the multiple planting of alfalfa and peas should continue to be appropriately promoted. State-owned farms should plant alfalfa to reach 20% to 30% of the total cultivated land area. All localities should continue to vigorously carry out the fertilizer accumulation campaign. Second, in terms of deep plowing, maintaining water and soil, and winter and spring irrigation, deep plowing is generally required to reach five to seven inches. In order to store water and conserve moisture in sloping land, horizontal ditches can be dug to prevent soil erosion. Winter and spring irrigation must be combined with rain moisture and fertilization. In addition, specific opinions were put forward on issues such as close planting, strip planting, improved varieties, and prevention and control of various natural disasters. The meeting also required all localities to combine the spirit of this meeting with local high-yield experience and practical examples to carry out in-depth and extensive ideological and organizational mobilization through people's congresses at all levels, cadre meetings, mutual aid team leader representative meetings, state-owned farm meetings, and labor model meetings, and overcome all conservative thinking and complacency among cadres and the masses. Furthermore, state-owned farms, agricultural production cooperatives, and year-round mutual aid groups were mobilized to study and formulate specific methods for next year's wheat production increase plan and technological improvements, and to carry out regional and seasonal chain competitions. At present, it is especially necessary to seize the time to do all the preparatory work for autumn planting to ensure good winter wheat planting.
    The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently issued instructions on autumn harvest and autumn planting, requiring that wheat planting work in various places should be based on a serious summary of local high-yield experience, and grasp the following important links: First, continue to prepare wheat fields; second, increase base fertilizer application; third, select and exchange improved varieties; fourth, gradually promote rational close planting.
    In the Central and South China region, cooperatives in various parts of Hunan Province are supplying farmers with grass seeds (green manure seeds) and various fertilizers needed for autumn planting. This year, the fertilizers and grass seeds that cooperatives have prepared to supply have increased significantly compared to last year. Grass seeds have increased by nearly three times compared to last year, and various cake fertilizers such as vegetable cakes and sesame cakes have increased by 59% compared to last year. In addition to purchasing a portion of fertilizers from neighboring provinces and regions early on, cooperatives this year paid special attention to local procurement, processing, and sales. In August, the Hanshou County Cooperative General Agency signed contracts with 124 handicraft oil presses in the county to purchase more than 12,000 dan of oilseed cake. Counties also paid attention to mutual adjustment. Cooperatives in various places along Dongting Lake, which produce more grass seeds, in addition to purchasing and supplying local needs, also transported more than 4,800 dan to cooperatives in mountainous areas such as LiuYang, LiLing and LuXi, which lacked grass seeds. These grass seeds have been transported in time during the rice harvest and have begun to be supplied. Farmers in various parts of Hubei Province are actively preparing fertilizers for autumn crops. Farmers in Santuan Township, JiaYu County, under the leadership of the township head, have accumulated more than 3,000 dan of grass fertilizer. When the third district of YiCheng County launched the patriotic production increase appraisal campaign, the accumulation of fertilizer was also included as one of the appraisal conditions.
    While actively preparing for the autumn harvest, farmers in various parts of the Southwest region also extracted a group of laborers to accumulate fertilizer and prepare the fertilizers needed for autumn planting. For example, in DaYao and DaBa villages in the fourth district of HanYuan County, about 80 people go to the mountains more than ten miles away from the village to cut grass every day; in XinShi village in the sixth district, an average of about 140 people cut grass and collect manure every day. Farmers in various districts and townships of RongJing County are also actively cutting artemisia. In GuCheng Village, FuShun Township, more than 100 people go out to cut grass and accumulate fertilizer every day.

    各地农民积极准备秋耕秋种
    党政领导机关重视今年小麦播种工作
    【本报讯】华东、西北、中南等地农民在各地党政机关的领导下，正在准备秋耕秋种，部分地区并已开始秋耕。现在农民都忙着修补农具、搭配牛犋、掉换良种和准备肥料。
    在华东区，山东省济宁县四区已修好犁耙一千八百件，搭配牲口一千二百犋。平邑等县五个乡农民购进耕牛一百三十九头。邹平县中心店乡农民添置新大车四辆和耕牛十七头。为保持地力，各地一般都做到了边收边耕。临沂、泰安、菏泽、济宁等专区，高粱和谷茬地已耕到百分之六十到九十。临沂县白岭乡通过算时间、算耕畜、算土地，扭转了干部和农民“地湿晚不了”的思想，使全乡一百七十犋耕畜全部下田耕地，四天中即耕地一千四百六十亩。莒南县十一区在秋耕中正领导农民改良土壤。山东省各级党政领导机关十分重视今年的小麦播种工作。省人民政府和各专署都及时下达了秋种的指示；文登、昌潍、泰安等专区还召开有劳动模范参加的小麦丰产座谈会，总结交流了选用良种和宽幅密植等经验。各级供销合作社为帮助农民增产粮食，对农具和肥料的供应都及早作了准备。省合作总社最近从大连等地调进化学肥料七百万斤，运往各地。莱阳、昌潍两专区的合作社已备妥豆饼、棉籽饼七千八百七十六万斤，化学肥料三千二百万斤，步犁三千部，水车两千部。各地合作社还组织当地的手工业者加工大批镢、锨、铁钯、铲头、耙齿等小农具，仅莱阳、临沂两专区即加工制成各种小农具四十多万件。莱阳专区合作社根据社员的意见，已派人到内蒙购买耕畜一万头。
    九月初江苏、安徽两省下了一场时雨。现在，江淮平原下透雨的地区，农民们正积极补种晚秋和蓄水防旱。江苏省早秋作物已收割的地区，原因干旱不能下犁，雨后泥湿土松。目前两省农民都积极着手准备小麦播种。
    华东各省产麦区今秋所需要的麦种都已准备妥当。浙江、福建两省夏季麦子丰收，种子一般不成问题。山东省农民的麦种也没有多大困难，据薛城县的典型调查，农民缺少的种子只占需要量的百分之五。安徽、江苏两省大部农民都留了麦种。农民所缺少的种子，各省都可就地解决。大部农民自留麦种和缺种能够就地解决，不但可以保证及时秋种，并且由于本地种子适应当地土壤和气候等自然条件，对明年增产麦子有很大好处。
    华东各地国营农场已准备了大批良种，以便在适当范围内向农民推广。夏收中农民自己评选的良种，也将通过掉换等方式，在当地推广。现在各地正在动员农民翻晒麦种，粮食部门也在把准备供应的种子翻晒，以保证发芽率和减少害虫。
    西北行政委员会农林局为了总结和交流今年西北各地冬小麦丰产经验，研究改进西北地区冬小麦种植技术的办法，给明年小麦增产打下良好基础，在最近召开了西北区冬小麦生产技术会议，会议根据今年西北各地的丰产经验以及存在的问题，确定了几项主要的小麦作务技术改进意见。第一，在合理倒茬、增施肥料方面，应继续适当地提倡多种苜蓿和豌豆。各国营农场所种苜蓿要达到全部耕地面积百分之二十到三十。各地应继续大力开展积肥运动。第二，在深耕、保持水土及冬春灌方面，一般要求深耕达到五寸至七寸。山坡地为了蓄水保墒，可挖水平沟，以防止水土流失。冬春灌必须结合雨墒和施肥进行。此外，对密植、条播、良种及防治各种自然灾害等问题，都提出了具体意见。会议并要求各地根据这次会议的精神，结合当地丰产经验与实际范例，通过各级人民代表会、干部会、互助组长代表会、国营农场会、劳动模范会等，进行深入、广泛的思想组织动员，克服干部和群众中的一切保守思想和自满情绪。并发动国营农场、农业生产合作社、常年互助组等研究制订明年小麦增产计划与技术改进具体办法，开展区域性和季节性的连环竞赛。目前尤须抓紧做好秋播的一切准备工作，保证种好冬麦。
    中共陕西省委会在最近发出了关于秋收秋播工作的指示，要求各地的小麦播种工作，应在认真总结当地丰产经验的基础上，抓紧以下几个重要环节：第一、继续整好麦田；第二、增施基肥；第三、选换良种；第四、逐步推行合理密植。
    在中南区，湖南省各地合作社正供应农民秋种时需要的草籽（绿肥的种子）和各种肥料。今年合作社已准备供应的肥料和草籽比去年增加很多。草籽比去年增加将近三倍，菜饼和麻饼等各种饼肥比去年增加百分之五十九。合作社今年除及早向邻省地区采购一部分肥料外，特别注意就地采购、加工和推销。汉寿县合作总社八月间与该县一百二十四家手工榨坊订立了收购一万二千多担榨饼合同。各县之间还注意互相调剂。出产草籽较多的洞庭湖滨各地合作社，除就地采购供应本地需要外，还运出了四千八百多担给缺少草籽的浏阳、醴陵和泸溪等山地的合作社。这些草籽都已在稻谷收割时及时运到，开始供应。湖北省各地农民正积极准备秋种作物的肥料。嘉鱼县三团乡农民，在乡长带头示范推动下，已积草肥三千多担。宜城县三区开展爱国增产评比运动时，把积肥也列为评比条件之一。
    西南区各地农民在积极准备秋收的同时，还抽出了一批劳动力来积肥，准备秋种所需要的肥料。如汉源县第四区大瑶、大坝两村，每天约有八十多人到离村十来里路远的山上去割草；第六区新市村每天平均约有一百四十人割草捡粪。荣经县各区乡农民也在积极打蒿，复顺乡古城村每天都有一百多人出外割草积肥。
