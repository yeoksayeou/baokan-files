    The No. 101 Construction Site of the North China Construction Engineering Company Does Not Follow Blueprints, Resulting in Inferior Construction Quality
    Liu Qingyu from the Basic Construction Engineering Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building sends a letter: The student dormitory of the Mechanical School, contracted by the No. 101 Construction Site of the North China Construction Engineering Company of the First Ministry of Machine Building, does not follow the original design drawings for the reinforced concrete project, and the quality is extremely poor.

    For example, the staircase of the first section of the second floor, according to the original design, the main reinforcing steel bars should be placed below the distribution steel bars, but now the main reinforcing steel bars are placed above the distribution steel bars. This reduces the safety factor of the building
    (the original design safety factor was 1.8, now only 1.42) and the load capacity per square meter (the original design load capacity per square meter was 300 kilograms, now only 126 kilograms). The staircase beam of the first section of the first floor was originally designed to be 20 cm wide, 20 cm high, and use two 10 mm and one 13 mm steel bars. The current beam is 15 cm wide, 15 cm high, and uses two 13 mm steel bars. Thus, the safety factor of the building only reaches 1.355 (the original design safety factor was 2), which can only bear the weight of the staircase slab and itself. Furthermore, the additional steel bars around the second floor, which were specified to be 6 mm in the drawings, were arbitrarily changed to 9 mm steel bars during construction, resulting in a large waste. There are many similar examples of construction not following the blueprints.

    From top to bottom, there is a serious tendency to neglect quality on the construction site. Leading cadres have not seriously educated employees to establish the idea of "quality first." When the inspection team of the Basic Construction Engineering Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building discovered that the position of the steel bars of the second floor staircase did not match the drawings, they suggested immediate correction. However, the leading cadres of the construction site said that they would "find ways to remedy it after the pressure test fails to meet the design requirements." For example, for the first section of the first floor, they constructed according to the discarded drawings. After being discovered by the inspection team, they still believed that "anyway, it is the first section of the first floor, even if the load capacity is not enough, adding a column can support it."

    The technical management system of the construction site is extremely unsound, and the operating procedures are not strictly followed. The water-cement ratio of the concrete is incorrect, has never been tested, and the mixing time is not correctly controlled. The cement has been placed on site for more than three months, and the date of manufacture is unknown. The 400-grade mixed ash was actually used as 300-grade concrete ash on the spot when pouring concrete.

    Leading cadres of the No. 101 Construction Site of the North China Construction Engineering Company must face these shortcomings squarely, educate and mobilize employees to improve project quality, and further establish in all employees the idea that basic construction projects are the "century-long plan" of the country, and the idea that "quality must come first."

### 华北建筑工程公司一零一工地不按图纸施工工程质量低劣

专栏：读者来信摘要

    华北建筑工程公司一零一工地不按图纸施工工程质量低劣
    中央第一机械工业部基本建设工程局刘庆雨来信：中央第一机械工业部华北建筑工程公司一零一工地所承建的机械学校学生宿舍，钢筋混凝土工程不按原设计图样施工，质量极其低劣。
    该工程二楼第一段楼梯，按原设计主力钢筋应放在分布钢筋下面，可是现在主力钢筋却放在分布钢筋的上面。这样就降低了建筑物的安全系数
    （原设计的安全系数为一点八，现在仅一点四二）和每平方公尺的载荷能力（原设计每平方公尺的载荷能力是三百公斤，现在仅一百二十六公斤）。一楼第一段的楼梯梁，原设计断面是二十公分宽、二十公分高和用二根十公厘、一根十三公厘的钢筋，现在的梁是断面十五公分宽、十五公分高和用二根十三公厘的钢筋。这样，建筑物的安全系数仅达一点三五五（原设计安全系数为二），只能承担楼梯平板及其本身重量。而二楼外围附加的钢筋，图上规定用六公厘的，施工时却擅自改用九公厘的钢筋，造成很大浪费。类似这样不按图纸施工的例子还多得很。
    该工地自上而下存在着严重的忽视质量的偏向。领导干部没有认真教育职工树立“质量第一”的思想。第一机械工业部基本建设工程局检查小组发现二楼楼梯的钢筋位置和图样不符时，曾建议立即改正。但工地领导干部却说要“经过压力试验达不到设计要求时再设法补救”。又如一楼第一段工程，他们根据废图纸就施工，经检查组发现后，还认为“反正是第一层第一段，即使载荷能力不够，加一根柱子就可以撑住”。
    工地的技术管理制度极不健全，操作规程也没被认真遵守。混凝土的水灰比不正确，从未做过试验，也不正确地掌握搅拌的时间。水泥放在现场已超过三个月，且不知出厂日期。四百号的混合灰，现场在打混凝土时竟当作三百号的混凝灰来使用。
    华北建筑工程公司一零一工地的领导干部必须正视这些缺点，教育并发动职工来改善工程质量，进一步在全体职工中树立基本建设工程是国家的“百年大计”，必须保证“质量第一”的思想。
