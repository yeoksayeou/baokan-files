Our Great Motherland
In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, great achievements have been made in popularizing the high-yield experience of Zhaoyuan County in Northeast China. This is millet planted this year by the Tianbao Agricultural Production Cooperative in Keqian Banner, eastern Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, using the new farming methods of Zhaoyuan County. It is estimated that the yield will be more than double that of the old methods. Farmers from nearby mutual aid groups have come here to visit. They are comparing the two different types of millet.
