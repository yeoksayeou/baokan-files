Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, September 18th: The Northwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held a series of meetings on August 31st and September 11th, 14th, and 15th to discuss the problem of launching a campaign to increase production and practice economy throughout the region in order to guarantee the fulfillment and over-fulfillment of the national plan.

The meetings pointed out that, in the execution of the first annual plan of the national Five-Year Construction Plan, the people of all ethnic groups in the Northwest Region have achieved many successes due to the high degree of enthusiasm and creativity displayed by the broad masses of workers, farmers, herdsmen and cadres in industrial production and capital construction, as well as their tenacious struggle against natural disasters in agricultural and pastoral production. The output of major products in state-owned industries, up to the end of August, has exceeded the eight-month plan. After overcoming severe natural disasters, agricultural production in other areas, with the exception of areas in Qinghai and Gansu provinces that suffered crop failures, have had good summer harvests. However, the work in various regions is unbalanced, and there is still great potential in industrial, agricultural, and pastoral production that has not been fully exploited. In particular, many heavy tasks in industrial production and capital construction need to be completed within the three-plus months remaining this year. Therefore, the meetings believe that the most urgent central task for Party organizations at all levels in the Northwest is to mobilize the entire Party, mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, tap production potential, and grasp and solve key problems, in order to strive to fulfill and over-fulfill the national plan.

The meetings pointed out that increasing industrial, agricultural, and pastoral production, and over-fulfilling the national plan, is the main source of increased income. In terms of industrial production, state-owned industries with fully guaranteed raw materials and sales should maximize the over-fulfillment of the national plan for several major products. Local state-owned industries should complete and over-fulfill their production plans on the basis of establishing and strengthening planned management and strictly calculating costs. Key factory and mine capital construction should strive to complete and over-fulfill the annual plan. Some factories and mines should also strive to put into production ahead of schedule. In completing the state's production and capital construction tasks, it is necessary to ensure quality, save raw materials, reduce costs, and accumulate and save more funds for the state. In terms of agricultural and pastoral production, the rural areas of the Northwest are now facing a tense period of protecting autumn crops, autumn harvesting, autumn planting, and autumn plowing. Party committees at all levels in agricultural areas should concentrate their efforts on doing these tasks well, and urge state-owned commercial departments and cooperatives in various regions to do a good job in supplying farmers with means of production and means of livelihood. The meetings emphasized that increasing production and saving grain is the most important condition for ensuring the smooth progress of national construction. Party committees at all levels must take all effective measures to increase grain harvests, do a good job in the assessment and storage of public grain, do a good job in grain procurement, and must pay attention to saving grain. Party committees in pastoral areas should take effective livestock protection measures, vigorously mobilize and organize the masses to cut grass and dig wells to prevent large-scale livestock deaths this winter and next spring.

The meetings pointed out that, while increasing production, it is also necessary to practice strict economy in all undertakings. Projects that are not urgently needed, or although important but lack the necessary conditions at present, should be suspended or postponed. Projects that have already started but whose plans are too high or too large should be reduced. Various administrative expenses should also be tightened in conjunction with improving management. Every staff member should be educated to understand how to use funds rationally and do things well, and gradually cultivate a thrifty atmosphere among the people. The meetings pointed out that transportation, materials supply, grain, loans, and taxation should not only take correct and effective measures to complete their own tasks of increasing production, practicing economy, and turning over profits, but should mainly serve the task of increasing industrial, agricultural, and livestock production. The meetings also pointed out that state-owned commerce should be prepared to combat speculative behavior among some industrial and commercial households, and tax officials should strictly prevent and correct the behavior of illegal industrial and commercial households who evade taxes.

(Further Dispatch) The industrial departments in the Northwest Region (including state-owned, local state-owned, and joint public-private enterprises) have separately drafted plans to increase production and practice economy. According to preliminary statistics, the total amount of increased production and savings is 167 trillion yuan, of which the production sector accounts for 51 percent; the capital construction sector (including projects whose construction is postponed) accounts for 40 percent; and the reduction in financial allocations due to the clearance of stagnant materials in local industries accounts for 9 percent.

The main products of state-owned industries in the Northwest, such as petroleum, coal, yarn, cloth, and electricity, have already over-fulfilled their plans for the past eight months. Since raw materials and sales are guaranteed, the production potential is still very large. Enterprises producing these products have formulated maximum plans for increasing production and practicing economy, while guaranteeing quality. The Yumen Mining Bureau plans to increase petroleum output value by nearly 75 trillion yuan. The four departments of textile, coal, electricity, and salt plan to increase the commodity output value by 29.5 billion yuan. The twelve most important industrial production units in the region plan to increase this year's profits and depreciation payments to the state by 16 percent. Local industries have decided to increase the original planned profit target by 13 percent.

The general direction of increasing production and practicing economy in capital construction units in the Northwest is to make the greatest effort to ensure quality, strive to complete and over-fulfill the annual plan, and practice strict economy and reduce projects that should be reduced during the work. Now, the relevant units have decided to save and reduce the state's financial investment by another 52 billion yuan from various aspects such as reducing costs, postponing secondary projects, and verifying overestimated parts.

Many responsible cadres of the Northwest Financial and Economic Committee and various industrial leading organs have gone deep into factories and mines to assist in launching competitions to increase production and practice economy.

    西北区动员各族人民增产节约
    工业部门订出增产节约一千多亿元的方案
    【新华社西安十八日电】中共中央西北局在八月三十一日和本月十一、十四、十五日连续举行会议，讨论全区开展增产节约运动以保证完成和超额完成国家计划的问题。
    会议指出：西北区各族人民在执行国家五年建设计划第一个年度计划中，由于广大工人、农牧民和干部在工业生产、基本建设工作中发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，在农牧业生产中和自然灾害进行了顽强斗争，因而已获有许多成绩。国营工业中主要产品的产量，截至八月底止，均已超额完成八个月的计划。农业生产在克服了严重的自然灾害以后，除青海、甘肃部分灾区歉收外，其他地区的夏季作物收成良好。但各地工作不平衡，工业、农业和牧业生产上还有很大潜力没有充分发挥出来，尤其工业生产和基本建设方面的许多繁重任务，要集中在年内三个多月的时间内完成。为此，会议认为：西北各级党组织当前最迫切的中心任务就是全党动员起来，发动群众，依靠群众，发掘生产潜力，抓住和解决关键问题，为完成和超额完成国家计划而斗争。
    会议指出：增加工、农、牧业生产，超额完成国家计划，是增加收入的主要源泉。在工业生产方面，国营工业中凡原料销路都有充分保证的几种主要产品，应当最大限度地超额完成国家计划。地方国营工业应在建立和加强计划管理、严格计算成本的基础上，完成并超额完成生产计划。重要厂矿的基本建设，应力争完成和超额完成年度计划。若干厂矿还应争取提前投入生产。在完成国家的生产和基本建设任务中，都须保证质量，节省原材料，降低成本，给国家积累和节约更多资金。在农牧业生产方面，西北农村现正面临保秋、秋收和秋播、秋翻地的紧张时期，农业地区的各级党委应集中全力做好这些工作；并督促各地国营商业部门和合作社做好对农民生产资料和生活资料的供应工作。会议着重指出：增产和节约粮食，是保证国家建设顺利进行最重要的条件。各级党委必须采取一切有效措施增加粮食的收获量，做好公粮计征和入仓工作，
    做好粮食收购工作，并须重视节约粮食。牧区党委
    应采取有效的保畜措施，大力发动和组织群众进行割草、挖井，防止今冬明春牲畜的大批死亡。
    会议指出：在增加生产的同时，还必须在所有事业中厉行节约。对于非紧迫需要或虽属重要但目前条件尚不具备的事业，应停办或缓办；已经开始举办但计划偏高偏大的事业应予削减；各项行政费用亦应结合改进管理工作力求紧缩。应使每一工作人员都由此受到教育，懂得如何合理使用资金，把事情办好，并逐渐在人民群众中养成节约的风气。会议指出：交通运输、物资供应、粮食、贷款和税收等方面，除须正确地采取有效措施，完成本身的增产节约任务和上缴利润的任务外，主要应为工业、农业和牧畜业的增产任务服务。会议并指出：国营商业应有准备地和部分工商户中的投机行为作斗争，税务工作人员应严密防止和纠正不法工商户偷税漏税的行为。
    （又讯）西北区各工业部门（包括国营、地方国营和公私合营）已分别拟订出增产节约方案。据初步统计，增产节约总额共一千六百七十亿元，其中生产部门占百分之五十一；基本建设部门（包括推迟建设的工程）占百分之四十；地方工业中清理呆滞材料因而减少的财务拨款占百分之九。
    西北国营工业中的石油、煤炭、纱、布、电等主要产品，过去八个月都已超额完成计划，由于原料和销路都有保证，生产潜力仍然很大，生产这些产品的企业单位，都已在保证质量的前提下，订出了最大限度的增产节约计划。玉门矿务局计划增加石油产值近七百五十亿元。纺织、煤炭、电业、盐业四个部门计划增加的商品产值二百九十五亿元。全区十二个最主要的工业生产单位，计划增加本年度上缴利润折旧计划百分之十六。地方工业决定把原订年计划上缴利润额提高百分之十三。
    西北各基本建设单位增产节约的总方向是：用最大努力，保证质量，力争年度计划的完成和超额完成，并在工作进行中厉行节约和削减应该削减的项目。现在，各有关单位决定从降低成本、推迟次要工程、核实冒估部分等各方面，再节约和缩减国家财务投资五百二十亿元。
    西北财政经济委员会和各工业领导机关的许多负责干部，已深入各厂矿协助开展增产节约竞赛。
