Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, September 17th: The Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee convened a mobilization meeting for party member cadres of Northeast regional and Shenyang municipal-level organs, organizations, factories, and enterprises on September 14th. At the meeting, Gu Zhuoxin, Vice Chairman of the Northeast Administrative Committee and Director of the Financial and Economic Committee, delivered a report on increasing production and practicing economy, mobilizing cadres and workers in industrial and mining enterprises throughout the region to strive to exceed the 1953 national plan.

In his report, Gu Zhuoxin first pointed out the great significance of striving to exceed the national production plan. He then described how industrial and mining enterprises and basic construction departments in Northeast China, including Shenyang, Anshan, Fushun, Harbin, Benxi, and Dalian, had launched a campaign to increase production and practice economy in July and August, following the instructions of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee. They had all formulated plans and goals for increasing production and practicing economy. As of early September, 95 factories and enterprises in Shenyang had set a goal of increasing production and practicing economy for the state by 1,070 billion yuan by the end of the year. Units under Anshan Iron and Steel Company and other state-owned and local state-owned industrial and mining enterprises in Anshan City formulated a plan to increase production and practice economy by 900 billion yuan. Fourteen state-owned factories and mines in Fushun City have formulated a plan to increase production and practice economy by 300 billion yuan. The coal mine system throughout the region is to increase coal production by more than 300,000 tons. Industrial and mining enterprises in other regions have also put forward their goals. In his report, Gu Zhuoxin pointed out that, based on the above situation, the potential strength within industrial and mining enterprises in Northeast China is very great, and therefore, it is entirely possible to strive to exceed this year's national production plan.

Next, Gu Zhuoxin reported in detail on the Northeast Bureau's eight measures for increasing production and practicing economy to exceed the national plan: First, in industry and transportation, it is necessary to increase production, increase income, increase profit accumulation, and exceed the national plan. Leading party cadres at all provincial and municipal levels, as well as in all industrial and mining enterprises, are required to go deep into the grassroots, helping one factory or mine, one workshop, one pit, and one work section to solve specific problems. Second, in basic construction: it is necessary to ensure project quality, accelerate project progress, and practice strict economy. While ensuring quality, we must vigorously promote advanced experience, continue to strengthen technical supply, continue to strengthen planning management, and promote construction operation plans. Third, in agriculture: vigorously protect the autumn harvest, complete the grain purchase plan, and pay attention to saving grain. In flooded areas, it is necessary to drain water and support seedlings to strive for possible harvests, and in general areas, it is necessary to ensure that the autumn harvest is carried out well. At the same time, we must pay attention to saving grain, increase the region's total grain harvest, increase income for the majority of farmers, and prepare for expanded reproduction next year. Fourth, in commercial trade: it is necessary to expand commodity purchase and sales, accelerate commodity turnover, accelerate capital turnover, and reduce circulation costs, increase profits, and complete the work of clearing assets and verifying funds. Fifth, strengthen financial supervision of state-owned enterprises and eliminate tax evasion by private industrial and commercial enterprises. Sixth, administrative organs and institutions must practice strict economy and cut expenditures. Seventh, dispose of stockpiled materials, reduce stockpiles, and save funds. Eighth, no more organizational structures should be added unnecessarily, and where possible, some appropriate streamlining should be carried out to improve work and increase work efficiency.

Finally, Gu Zhuoxin emphasized that in implementing the plan to increase production and practice economy, it is necessary to prevent the bias of simply pursuing numbers and letting things take their own course. Party and government organizations at all levels must thoroughly mobilize the masses, practice careful calculation and strict budgeting, and formulate practical and feasible plans for increasing production and practicing economy based on the characteristics of each factory and mine enterprise.

    中共中央东北局召开增产节约动员大会
    全区争取超额完成今年国家计划
    【新华社沈阳十七日电】中共中央东北局于九月十四日召开东北一级及沈阳市级机关、团体、工厂、企业的党员干部动员大会。会上，由东北行政委员会副主席兼财政经济委员会主任顾卓新作了关于增产节约的报告，动员全区干部和工矿企业的职工为争取超额完成一九五三年国家计划而努力。
    顾卓新在报告中首先指出争取超额完成国家生产计划的重大意义。接着他叙述了东北沈阳、鞍山、抚顺、哈尔滨、本溪、大连等地区的工矿企业及基本建设部门，根据中共中央东北局的指示已先后在七、八月间开展了增产节约的竞赛，并都制订了增产节约的计划和奋斗目标。沈阳市截至九月上旬，已有九十五个工厂企业单位提出到年底为国家增产节约一万零七百亿元的奋斗目标。鞍山钢铁公司所属单位及鞍山市其他国营、地方国营工矿企业制订出增产节约九千亿元的计划。抚顺市十四个国营厂矿已制订出三千亿元的增产节约计划。全区煤矿系统要增产三十多万吨煤炭。其他各地工矿企业单位也都提出了奋斗目标。顾卓新在报告中指出：根据上述情况，东北各地工矿企业内部的潜在力量是很大的，因此，争取超额完成今年国家生产计划是完全可能的。
    接着，顾卓新详细报告了东北局关于增产节约、超额完成国家计划的八项措施方案：第一，工业、运输业方面，要增加生产、增加收入、增加利润积累，超额完成国家计划。要求各省市、各工矿企业的党的负责干部，深入下层，帮助一个厂矿、一个车间、一个坑口、一个工段具体解决问题。第二，基本建设方面：要保证工程质量，加快工程进度，厉行节约。要在保证质量的前提下，大力推广先进经验，继续加强技术供应，继续加强计划管理，推行施工作业计划。第三，农业方面：大力保护秋收，完成粮食征购计划，注意节约粮食。在水涝地区要排水扶苗争取可能的收成，一般地区要保证做好秋收。同时要注意节约粮食，增加全区粮食的收获量，并为广大农户增加收入，准备明年扩大再生产。第四，商业贸易方面：要扩大商品购销、加速商品周转、加速资金周转和降低流转费用，增加利润，并完成清理资产，核定资金工作。第五，加强国营企业财务监督，肃清私营工商业偷税漏税。第六，行政机关事业部门，要厉行节约，紧缩开支。第七，处理积压物资，减少积压，节约资金。第八，不再增加编制，不必要的机构，在可能的条件下，进行一些适当的精简，改善工作，提高工作效率。
    最后，顾卓新强调指出：在贯彻增产节约的计划时，要防止单纯追求数字和放任自流偏向。各级党政组织要深入发动群众，精打细算，根据各个厂矿企业的特点订出切实可行的增产节约计划。
