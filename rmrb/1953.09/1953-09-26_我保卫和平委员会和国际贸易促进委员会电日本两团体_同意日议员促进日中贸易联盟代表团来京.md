Xinhua News Agency, September 25th: Regarding the dispatch of a delegation from the Japan-China Friendship Association and the Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade to our country to participate in the 1953 National Day celebrations and to visit, after the China Peace Committee and the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade replied on September 19th, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade successively received telegrams from Tsunejiro Hiratsuka, Chairman of the Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade, on September 22nd and 23rd. Tsunejiro Hiratsuka telegraphed on September 22nd:

    "Your reply is acknowledged. Our Diet Members' League, according to the decision of the Board of Directors, agrees to your country's CPPCC sending a trade inspection group to Japan. In order to promote its realization, we are willing to do our best to break through the obstacles of the Japanese government. As a result of negotiations with government authorities on this matter, they have not yet agreed. However, our League will continue to strive to make the government acknowledge this decision.

    We understand that the number of members of the inspection group is 25. The elected and dispatched members of the Diet are as shown in the previous telegram, following the principle of including all parties and factions. In addition to the 12 members mentioned in the previous telegram, a Communist Party representative, Goro Suto (56 years old), a composer, is newly elected; another representative from the Ryokufukai is yet to be decided. The list of industry experts and staff members who have not been reported will be telegraphed tomorrow.

    Travel expenses and accommodation expenses will be borne by our side before entering your country's borders. We are willing to accept your country's kind invitation for all expenses within your country. When your country's delegation visits Japan, we will bear the same responsibility for taking care of everything.

    The passport of representative Kei Hoashi has been refused by the government, and we are currently working hard to resolve it."

On September 24th, the Japan-China Friendship Association telegraphed the China Peace Committee again, stating:

    "Regarding our passports, Foreign Minister Katsuo Okazaki stated on the 22nd that since China and Japan have no formal relations, there is no need to send observation delegations to China. Our delegation will face great difficulties in departing on schedule, but we will still strive to do so."

After receiving the above telegrams, our China Peace Committee and China Council for the Promotion of International Trade replied to the Standing Council of the Japan-China Friendship Association and Tsunejiro Hiratsuka, Chairman of the Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade, on September 25th. The original text is as follows: To the Standing Council of the Japan-China Friendship Association: To Mr. Tsunejiro Hiratsuka, Chairman of the Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade:

    (1) Your Association's telegram of September 24th is acknowledged. The points declared by Japanese government Foreign Minister Katsuo Okazaki on the 22nd prove that the Yoshida government continues to adopt its reactionary policy of hostility towards the People's Republic of China and hostility towards the Chinese people. We are filled with indignation. We express our respect for your association's continued efforts to break through the Yoshida government's obstruction and strive to come to our country for a visit. We hope to maintain contact at any time in order to provide assistance as much as possible.

    (2) Your League's telegrams of September 22nd and September 23rd and the list of 13 Diet Members' League representatives, 10 industry and trade experts, and 2 staff members, totaling 25 people, have been received. As a result of our association's application to our government for entry visas for your League's delegation, it has been agreed that your League's delegation, composed of Ginzo Nagashima, Natsuo Eto, Sanzunosuke Nakamura, Soichiro Kita, Masanosuke Ikeda, Takechiyo Matsuda, Koichi Nakamura, Shigeyoshi Matsumae, Kei Hoashi, Toshio Tanaka, Akira Kazami, Kihachiro Kimura, Goro Suto, Yasushi Yuge, Koichi Uda, Sataro Murayama, Kiyoshi Hirano, Zenkichi Oshima, Kozo Nobuto, Den Kawakatsu, Fujiro Taniguchi, Hideshirō Sakurazawa, Yoshitaka Kikuchi, Yasutoshi Hayashi, Osao Koshi, and 25 others, will enter Beijing through Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, China. This fact can powerfully prove how our people and our government are working hard to promote friendly relations between the Chinese people and the peace-loving Japanese people, while the Japanese Yoshida government's open refusal to allow a delegation from the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to visit Japan precisely demonstrates that the reactionary Yoshida government is continuing its consistent reactionary policy of hostility towards the Chinese people and the People's Republic of China. But we firmly believe that, based on the promise of your League's continued efforts, and with the support and urging of the peace-loving Japanese people, the wish of our CPPCC delegation to visit Japan will eventually be realized. We hereby convey this message.

    The China Council for the Promotion of International Trade

    我保卫和平委员会和国际贸易促进委员会电日本两团体
    同意日议员促进日中贸易联盟代表团来京
    【新华社二十五日讯】关于日本日中友好协会和日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟派遣代表团前来我国参加一九五三年国庆典礼并访问事，自中国人民保卫世界和平委员会和中国国际贸易促进委员会于九月十九日复电后，中国国际贸易促进委员会于九月二十二日和二十三日又相继接到日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟理事长平冢常次郎来电。平冢常次郎二十二日来电称：
    “复电敬悉。我议员联盟据理事会决议，同意贵国政治协商会议派遣通商视察团来日。为促其实现，愿尽全力打破日本政府的阻障，关此与政府当局折冲结果，目前尚不予同意。但我联盟为使政府承认该决议将继续努力。
    谅解视察团员数为二十五人，推选派遣议员如前电所示，遵照包括各党各派原则，除前电十二人外，从新推选共产党代表须藤五郎（五六岁），作曲家；另绿风会代表尚待决定。产业专家及工作员之未报名单，明日电告。
    旅费及驻在费用，入贵国国境以前，我方自己担负，贵国境内之一切费用，愿接受贵国好意的招待；更贵国代表团访日时，我方负同样责任照顾一切。
    帆足计代表之护照遭政府拒绝，现正努力解决中。”
    九月二十四日，日中友好协会又致电中国人民保卫世界和平委员会称：
    “关于我们的护照，外务相冈崎胜男于二十二日声称，中国与日本没有正式关系，没有必要派遣观礼代表赴中国。我们的代表团要如期启程，是要面临着很大困难的，但仍尽力争取。”
    我中国人民保卫世界和平委员会及中国国际贸易促进委员会于接获上述来电后，于九月二十五日复电日本日中友好协会常任理事会及日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟理事长平冢常次郎，原文如下：日本日中友好协会常任理事会：日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟理事长平冢常次郎先生：
    （一）贵协会九月二十四日电悉。日本政府外务相冈崎胜男二十二日宣称各点，证明吉田政府继续采取其敌视中华人民共和国与敌视中国人民之反动政策，我们不胜愤慨。对贵协会继续努力打破吉田政府之阻挠而争取前来我国访问之举，特表敬意。盼随时保持联络，以便尽可能予以协助。
    （二）贵联盟九月二十二日、九月二十三日来电及议员联盟代表十三名、产业贸易专家十名、工作人员两名合共二十五名之名单业已收悉。经敝会向我国政府申请贵联盟代表团入境签证的结果，同意贵联盟代表团由长岛银藏，江藤夏雄，中村三之丞，喜多壮一郎，池田正之辅，松田竹千代，中村高一，松前重义，帆足计，田中稔男，风见章，木村禧八郎，须藤五郎，弓削靖，宇田耕一，村山佐太郎，平野清，大岛善吉，信藤孝三，川胜传，谷口藤一郎，樱泽秀次郎，菊池善隆，林宁寿，越寿男等二十五人所组成之代表团由中国广东省深圳入境，前来北京。这一事实可以有力证明，我国人民与我国政府是如何努力于促进中国人民与爱好和平的日本人民之间的友好关系，而日本吉田政府公开拒绝我国人民政治协商会议代表团之访问日本，正说明吉田反动政府仍在继续其一贯的敌视中国人民与中华人民共和国之反动政策。但我们坚信，根据贵联盟所作的继续努力的诺言，并在爱好和平的日本人民的支持和督促下，我国人民政治协商会议代表团前往日本访问之愿望是终将会实现的。谨此电达。
