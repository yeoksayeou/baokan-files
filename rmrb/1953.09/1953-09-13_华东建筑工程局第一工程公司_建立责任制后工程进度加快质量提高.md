    No. 1 Engineering Company of East China Construction Engineering Bureau
    After Establishing Responsibility System, Project Progress Accelerated and Quality Improved
    The organizational reform movement of the No. 1 Engineering Company of the East China Construction Engineering Bureau concluded at the end of July. Through the reform, various responsibility systems were established, labor organization was streamlined, labor discipline was rectified, and worker productivity generally improved, providing favorable conditions for completing arduous national basic construction projects in the future.
    In June of last year, in order to undertake the construction of 20,000 housing units, the company expanded from a construction unit of less than 300 people to a construction worker force of more than 20,000 in a very short period of time. Due to serious blind and rash advancement on the part of the leadership, unreasonable organizational structure, unsound systems, and the separation of politics from production, organizational chaos, poor project quality, material waste, and lax labor discipline occurred.
    After the company's organizational reform movement began this year, a broad mass-based work of investigating waste, investigating quality, and investigating phenomena of no one being responsible was launched in response to this serious chaotic situation. A total of 7,370 incidents of waste, poor quality, and losses due to no one being responsible were found. Among them, the waste of materials handled by one material clerk amounted to 3.4 billion yuan. Based on the principle of "investigating, reforming, and building simultaneously," the leadership reformed the management structure, abolished the offices, and established a three-level organizational structure of company, engineering office, and construction site. The organization of the assembly line brigade was abolished, and the original types of work teams were assigned to the unified leadership of each engineering office, changing the multi-headed functional leadership system in the management structure to a unified regional management system. In terms of labor organization, a comprehensive reorganization was carried out based on investigation and research into the labor, skills, physical condition, history, and other conditions of each worker, and re-compiled according to different professional divisions of labor. In addition, the management structure established five responsibility systems: construction site director responsibility system, administrative special responsibility system, planning responsibility system, construction management responsibility system, and technical supply responsibility system. The squadron established a team affairs and production meeting system. In terms of labor organization, responsibility systems such as production meetings, shift handover, product labeling, and work completion inspection were established. Each unit and each member clarified their tasks and mutual relationships, ensuring that the project proceeded in an orderly manner.
    While establishing the responsibility system, in order to ensure the implementation of the responsibility system, the work style of cadres and the labor discipline of workers were also rectified.
    After the organizational reform movement, a new atmosphere emerged everywhere in the company. Based on the regional management system and various responsibility systems, several newly started projects have begun to organize parallel assembly line operations in sections, and production is carried out rhythmically according to the indicated charts. The productivity of workers has generally improved. Taking the First Engineering Office as an example, since the plan was ordered in March, only about 80 percent of the task could be completed each month. After the organizational reform and rectification of labor discipline, 109 percent was completed in June. In order to ensure project quality, the Second and Third Directly Subordinate Construction Sites took the initiative to inspect the housing projects and repaired 140 households with more serious quality accidents. Abiding by labor discipline has also become a conscious action of workers. Workers have begun to pay attention to carrying out criticism and self-criticism, so phenomena such as "dawdling" and fighting have become rare. After the "three investigations," piles of materials picked up by workers from the site during rest time were piled up at the entrance of the squadron department every day. The phenomenon of messy construction site materials no longer exists. After criticizing their past ideological style of not being at ease with work and being divorced from reality, the cadres have also gone deep into the construction sites to study and solve problems in production in a timely manner. In particular, the political work cadres have studied their business and changed the serious phenomenon of the past where politics was divorced from technology, and the advantages and disadvantages of workers can be praised and criticized in a timely and correct manner.
    Now, on the basis of the victory of the organizational reform movement, the company is organizing cadres to study planned management in order to prepare ideologically for the planned management work that is about to be launched.

    建立责任制后工程进度加快质量提高
    华东建筑工程局第一工程公司的组织改革运动，已于七月底结束。经过改革，建立了各种责任制度，整理了劳动组织，整顿了劳动纪律，工人生产效率普遍提高，对今后完成繁重的国家基本建设工程，提供了良好的条件。
    去年六月，该公司为了承建二万户工房工程，在很短时期内将一个不满三百人的施工单位扩大为拥有二万多人的建筑工人队伍。因为领导上存在严重的盲目冒进情绪、组织机构不合理、制度不健全、政治与生产脱节等而造成了组织混乱、工程质量低劣、材料浪费和劳动纪律松弛等现象。
    今年该公司组织改革运动开始后，针对这种严重的混乱情况展开了广泛的群众性的查浪费、查质量、查无人负责现象的工作。计查出属于浪费、质量低劣、因无人负责造成损失的事件，总计七千三百七十件。其中有一个材料员所经手的材料，浪费竟达三十四亿元。领导上根据“边查、边改、边建”的方针，改革了管理机构，撤销办事处，建立起公司、工程处和工地的三级组织形式，撤销流水大队机构，将原工种队分别划归各工程处统一领导，使管理机构上的多头职能领导制改为统一的区域管理制。在劳动组织上，调查研究了每一工人的劳动、技术、身体、历史等情况，进行了一次全面的整顿，按照不同的专业分工重新编制。此外，在管理机构上建立了工地主任负责制、行政专责制、计划负责制、施工管理负责制、技术供应负责制等五项责任制度。中队建立队务、生产会议制度。在劳动组织上，建立了生产会议、交接班、产品挂牌、收工检查等责任制度。使每一单位每一成员明确了自己的任务和相互的关系，保证了工程有秩序地进行。
    在建立责任制度同时，为了保证责任制度的贯彻，又结合整顿了干部的工作作风及工人的劳动纪律。
    经过组织改革运动后，该公司到处出现着新气象。在区域管理制及各种责任制度的基础上，几个新开始的工程已开始组织分段平行流水作业，按指示图表进行有节奏的生产。工人们的生产效率已普遍提高，以第一工程处为例，从三月份订计划以来，每月只能完成任务百分之八十左右，经过了组织改革及整顿劳动纪律后，六月份即完成百分之一百零九。第二、三直属工地为了保证工程质量，职工们主动检查了工房工程，并将其中有较严重质量事故的一百四十户进行了修理。遵守劳动纪律也已成为工人们自觉的行动。工人们已开始注意展开批评与自我批评，因而“磨洋工”和打架等现象均已少见。“三查”后，在中队部门口每天堆着工人们在休息时间从场地上拾回来的大堆材料。工地材料的凌乱现象已不再存在。干部们批判了过去不安心工作、脱离实际等思想作风后，也已深入工地，及时研究与解决生产中的问题。特别是政治工作干部钻研了业务，转变了过去政治与技术脱节的严重现象，工人中的优缺点也能得到及时而又正确的表扬与批评。
    现在，该公司已在组织改革运动胜利的基础上，组织干部学习计划管理，为即将开展的计划管理工作做好思想上的准备。
