Implementing the Policy of Supervisory Work Serving Economic Construction
Inspection Teams Dispatched by the Supervision Department of Sichuan Provincial Department of Finance

In the first quarter of this year, the Supervision Department of the Sichuan Provincial People's Government's Department of Finance organized a large number of supervisory personnel into seventeen inspection teams. They went successively to eight special districts including Fuling, Wanxian, and the former Meishan, and two cities, Chengdu and Zigong, to inspect grain storage, the use of cultural and educational funds, municipal construction, and the production situation of enterprises. At the same time, leading organs at the special commissioner's office and county levels also organized forces to conduct inspections in the above-mentioned areas (a total of 191 units were inspected).

Judging from the inspection situation, most units have done a lot of work in completing various aspects of the national plan. However, leadership in some units shows serious irresponsibility towards state property, manifested in the following aspects:

First, in terms of capital construction, some units started construction without making budgets, reporting plans, or obtaining approval. For example, Fuling County No. 1 Middle School, without approval from relevant leading organs, arbitrarily started constructing school buildings according to a huge budget of 11.7 billion yuan, including facilities such as power plants; and unrealistically put forward the slogan of making school facilities "completely socialist!" Dazhu County planned to spend 700 to 800 million yuan to build a "cultural district" in the suburbs; Qinglai County's public security bureau had serious waste phenomena when building dormitories. Zigong City's former South Sichuan No. 2 Hospital, without review and approval from any competent authority, used the remaining 560 million yuan from the construction of the outpatient department to build a kitchen. Zigong City's water plant has already invested 7.3 billion yuan, but the utilization rate of all engineering equipment only reached 15.4 percent. Even three years later, when the urban population develops to the ideal standard, the utilization rate of equipment cannot reach 50 percent.

Second, in terms of the expenditure of operating funds, funds were not used for their designated purposes, false reports were made to embezzle funds, hidden surpluses were not turned over, expenses were arbitrarily made, and there was extravagance and waste. Dazhu County Normal School and two other schools transferred 1 billion yuan of capital construction funds to Chongqing at the end of 1952 to rush to purchase equipment. A cadre school in Fuling actually spent 12 million yuan on repairs but reported more than 184.4 million yuan for reimbursement, overreporting transportation costs by more than 19 million yuan when the actual cost was 1 million yuan, and hiding the remaining funds without turning them over.

Third, in terms of grain storage, there were found to be improper storage practices, and the phenomenon of mold and deterioration was very serious. In remote areas with inconvenient transportation, the amount of "dead-end grain storage" was very large. In the Dachuan County area alone, 80 million catties of yellow grain were stored for a long time and could not be transported out in time. Due to lax acceptance standards, the moisture content of most stored grain exceeded the safe standard by about 20 percent, resulting in the deterioration of much of the stored grain. Rented civilian warehouses suffered losses due to rudimentary equipment (without proper repairs).

The inspection team also inspected several enterprises and found that some factories did not complete their production and financial plans on time. Due to improper allocation and use of labor, inadequate production equipment, and imperfect acceptance systems, Chengdu Machinery Factory had many rework and high scrap rates. In 1952, it only completed 72.5 percent of its production tasks. The factory's total output value in 1952 was 5.8 billion yuan, while waste amounted to more than 1.05 billion yuan. Zigong City's Factory 402 made 370 water pipes, of which 205 were scrapped. Secondly, the phenomenon of stockpiling of product materials and sluggish capital turnover was also very serious. A large portion of Chengdu Machinery Factory's 2.9 billion yuan in capital was tied up in materials and semi-finished products. Cost accounting, finance, and accounting systems were also imperfect.

With the deepening of inspection work, cases of embezzlement of state property by corrupt elements were also discovered. For example, Li Guotian, the director of the material factory of the Baisha Dyeing Factory in Jiangjin County, had embezzled public funds before the "Three-Anti" campaign, but this was not discovered in time. The inspection team exposed this fact after going to the factory, and Li Guotian has been removed from his post. Embezzlement cases were also discovered in the inspection of municipal construction projects in Neijiang.

In this inspection, the supervisory work fully exerted its power. For example, after the inspection personnel discovered that grain was not being stored well, they urged the storage departments to quickly improve storage methods, thereby preventing a large amount of grain from rotting. Violations of financial and economic discipline and waste phenomena in some units were also corrected. While exposing these problems, the inspection team also specifically helped the inspected units establish systems, clear accounts, check inventory materials, and propose specific ways to improve work as much as possible. When inspecting capital construction in Neijiang, the inspectors discovered uneven foundations and immediately gave suggestions to the foremen and discussed ways to improve them on the spot. In order to arouse the vigilance of employees against waste phenomena, the inspectors collected relevant materials on this aspect and held exhibitions on-site; or conducted criticism through blackboard newspapers.

After this guided and purposeful inspection, the Supervision Department of the Sichuan Provincial People's Government's Department of Finance generally increased the confidence of its staff. They studied technology with workers and technicians on-site, looking for the key to problems; after arriving at the inspected unit, they strived for the leadership of the relevant units to pay attention to the supervisory work, strictly abided by the learning and living system of the inspected unit, which changed some of the uncoordinated phenomena between the supervisors and the inspected units, enabling the supervisory work to receive the support of leaders and the masses. The working group inspecting the municipal construction of Chengdu City helped construction workers improve the quality of work and shorten the construction time. All employees therefore participated in the inspection work. They expressed infinite kindness to the supervisory staff, saying: "The inspection by the inspection team made us realize the shortcomings in our past work."

### 贯彻监察工作为经济建设服务的方针  四川省财政厅监察处派出小组进行检查

    贯彻监察工作为经济建设服务的方针
    四川省财政厅监察处派出小组进行检查
    四川省人民政府财政厅监察处在今年第一季度内，组织大批监察工作人员，组成十七个检查小组，先后到涪陵、万县、原眉山等八个专区和成都、自贡两个市，检查了粮食的保管、文教经费的使用以及市政建设和企业部门的生产情况等；同时，各专署、县级领导机关也组织力量就上述几方面进行了检查（被检查的单位共有一百九十一个）。
    从检查的情况看来，大多数单位在完成国家计划的各个方面都做了不少的工作，但若干单位的领导方面对国家财产有严重不负责的现象，表现在如下几个方面：
    第一，在基本建设方面，有的单位，不造预算，不报计划，不经批准即行动工。如涪陵县第一中学未经有关领导机关批准，竟擅自按照一百十七亿元的巨额预算修建校舍，其中包括发电厂等设备；并且不切实际地提出要使学校设备“完全社会主义化！”的口号。大竹县拟用七、八亿元在城郊修建“文化区”；邛崃县公安局修建宿舍时有严重的浪费现象。自贡市前川南第二医院未经任何主管单位审核批准，竟将修建门诊部余款五亿六千余万元，修建了一座厨房。自贡市修建的自来水厂已投资七十三亿元，而全部工程设备利用率只达到百分之十五点四，即使在三年以后，城市人口发展到理想的标准，设备的利用率也不能达到百分之五十。
    第二，在事业费的开支方面，专款不专用，虚报冒领，埋伏结余款不上缴，随意开支，铺张浪费。大竹县师范等三个学校，于一九五二年终将基本建设费十亿元汇至重庆抢购器材。涪陵某干部学校修缮费实际开支一千二百万元，而向上报销一亿八千四百余万元，搬运费实用一百万元虚报一千九百多万元，余款不上缴，打下埋伏。
    第三，在粮食的保管方面，发现有不妥善的地方，发霉变质的现象很严重，交通不便的偏僻地区，“死角存粮”数量很大。只达县专区即长期存放黄谷八千余万斤，不能及时调运出去。由于验收不严，存粮的水分大都超过安全标准百分之二十左右，以致很多存粮变了质。借用的民仓，因设备简陋（没有适当修理），使粮食受到了损失。
    检查小组对若干企业也进行了检查，发现某些工厂没有按时完成生产计划和财务计划。成都机械厂由于劳动力的调配和使用不当，生产设备不周，验收制度不健全，返工很多，废品率很大，一九五二年只完成百分之七十二点五的生产任务。该厂一九五二年生产总值五十八亿元，而浪费就达十亿零五千多万元。自贡市四○二厂做出自来水管三百七十根，报废即达二百零五根。其次，产品材料积压、资金周转不灵的现象也很严重。成都机械厂资金二十九亿元大部分积压在材料和半制成品上。成本计算、财务、会计等制度也不健全。
    随着检查工作的深入，也发现了贪污分子盗窃国家资财的事件。如江津专区白沙染厂材料厂长李国田，在“三反”前就贪污公款，但未能及时发现，这次检查组下厂后，揭发了这一事实，并已予李国田撤职处分。在检查内江市政建设工程中也发现了贪污的事件。
    在这次检查中，监察工作充分发挥了力量。例如检查人员在发现了粮食保管得不好的情况后，即督促保管部门迅速改善保管办法，从而使大批粮食免于霉烂。某些单位违反财经纪律和浪费的现象也得到纠正。检查组在揭发这些问题的同时，还具体帮助被检查单位建立制度、清理帐目、查点库存物资，并尽可能提出改进工作的具体办法。监察人员在内江检查基本建设时，发现有基脚不平的情况，他们即向监工人员提出意见，当场研讨改进的办法。为要引起职工对浪费现象的警惕，监察人员搜集了有关这方面的材料，在现场举行了展览；或通过黑板报进行批评。
    四川省人民政府财政厅监察处，经过这次有领导、有目的的检查以后，普遍提高了工作人员的信心。他们在现场和工人、技术人员一起钻研技术，寻找问题的关键；到达被检查单位后，争取有关单位的领导方面对监察工作的重视，严格遵守被检查单位的学习和生活制度，这样就改变了监察工作者和被检查单位之间某些不协调的现象，使监察工作得到领导和群众的支持。检查成都市市政建设的工作小组，帮助施工人员提高了工作质量，缩短了施工的时间。全体职工因而都参加了检查工作。他们向监察工作人员表现无限的亲切，说：“检查组的检查，使我们认识到了过去工作中的缺点。”
