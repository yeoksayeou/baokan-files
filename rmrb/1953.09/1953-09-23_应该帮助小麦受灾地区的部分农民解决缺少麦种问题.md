    Should Help Some Farmers in Wheat Disaster Areas Solve the Problem of Lacking Wheat Seeds

    A letter from Wang Yuting of the North China Supply and Marketing Cooperative General Office: This year, farmers in some wheat disaster areas lack wheat seeds. For example, in some villages in the suburbs of Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province, some wheat has jaundice, and the wheat grains are not full enough. Some farmers have to go to other places to buy wheat seeds. Similar situations exist in a few areas in Hebei, Anhui and other provinces. However, at present, the county and district people's governments and supply and marketing cooperatives in some wheat-affected areas have not paid attention to this issue, and they have not taken timely measures to help farmers solve this difficulty. For example, when some farmers requested the supply of wheat seeds, the cadres of the Xiwenzhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative in the suburbs of Taiyuan City actually said: "Without instructions from above, we cannot be responsible." The local farmers are extremely dissatisfied.

    I believe that the people's governments and supply and marketing cooperatives in wheat-affected areas should take the initiative to care about and actively solve the difficulties of some farmers who lack wheat seeds: on the one hand, the local people's government should organize farmers to carefully select wheat seeds and adjust them among themselves; on the other hand, the local supply and marketing cooperatives should, according to actual needs, try to purchase and supply wheat seeds.

### 应该帮助小麦受灾地区的部分农民解决缺少麦种问题

    应该帮助小麦受灾地区的部分农民解决缺少麦种问题
    华北供销合作总社王玉廷来信：今年部分小麦受灾区农民缺少小麦种籽。如山西省太原市郊区某些村子部分小麦长了黄疸，麦粒不够饱满，有的农民只得到外地去买麦种。河北、安徽等省少数地区也有类似情况。但是，目前还有个别小麦受灾区的县、区人民政府和供销合作社对这个问题没有重视，他们没有及时设法帮助农民解决这个困难。如太原市郊区西温庄供销合作社的干部在某些农民要求供应麦种时，竟说：“没有上级指示，我们不能负责。”当地农民极为不满。
    我认为，小麦受灾地区的人民政府和供销社应该主动关心并积极解决某些农民缺少小麦种籽的困难：一方面，当地人民政府应该组织农民精选麦种，并互相调剂；另一方面，当地供销合作社应该根据实际需要，设法采购和供应麦种。
