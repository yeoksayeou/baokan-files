Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 20th: The United Nations General Assembly plenary session continued its general debate on the 18th.

    During the morning session on the 18th, the Chilean representative called for practical measures to prevent the threat of a world economic crisis. He requested that the Eighth UN General Assembly pay attention to how to raise the living standards of people in all countries.

    Australian Foreign Minister Casey delivered a lengthy speech, essentially repeating Dulles' speech on September 17th. New Zealand Representative Webb spoke, also following Dulles' opinions.

    At the afternoon session on the 18th, Pakistani Representative Zafrulla Khan spoke, welcoming the "moderate" tone of Dulles' speech on September 17th. Zafrulla Khan expressed doubt about whether Dulles' statement on the Indochina issue was appropriate. According to Dulles, France had already promised to return "sovereignty" to Indochina, thus the struggle in Indochina was unreasonable. Zafrulla Khan said that even if France had made such a promise, it was only due to the fierce struggle that had taken place in Indochina. He added that if one thought about France's suppression of freedom and independence in Tunisia and Morocco, doubts about this could be resolved. He asked, if France did not recognize the rights of the people of Tunisia and Morocco, should it not "be morally condemned"? Zafrulla Khan said that he would like to add that "the events in North Africa gave Western countries an opportunity to prove their intentions."

    Indonesian representative, Foreign Minister Sunarjo, said that in this world troubled by the Cold War, Indonesia is doing its best to implement an independent and active policy aimed at achieving world peace, thereby avoiding being dragged into the Cold War. He said that Indonesia will continue to work to end the current abnormal international situation. He then stated that Indonesia is in favor of holding a round table conference to discuss the Korean issue, with the participation of not only the belligerent countries, but also countries that did not participate in the war but are concerned and can help solve the Far East issue. Sunarjo condemned France's policies in Tunisia and Morocco, as well as the apartheid policy of the Union of South Africa, and called for strengthening international cooperation to consolidate world peace.

    The meeting adjourned at this point.

    联合国大会全体会议继续进行一般性辩论
    印尼代表赞成举行圆桌会议讨论朝鲜问题
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社纽约十八日讯：联合国大会十八日全体会议继续进行一般性辩论。
    在十八日上午会议上，智利代表号召采取切实措施，防止世界经济危机的威胁。他要求联合国第八届大会注意如何提高世界各国人民的生活水平。
    澳大利亚外交部长凯西发表了长篇的演说，基本上是重复一遍杜勒斯九月十七日的发言。新西兰代表韦伯发言，他也追随杜勒斯的意见。
    在十八日下午会议上，巴基斯坦代表查弗鲁拉汗发言，他对杜勒斯九月十七日发言的“缓和”语气表示欢迎。查弗鲁拉汗表示怀疑杜勒斯对印度支那问题的说法是否恰当。照杜勒斯的说法，法国已经允诺把“主权”交还印度支那，因而印度支那的斗争是没有道理的。查弗鲁拉汗说，即使法国曾有过这种允诺，那也只是由于在印度支那发生了激烈的斗争。他又说，如果想一想法国在突尼斯和摩洛哥对自由与独立的压制，关于这一点的怀疑就可以得到解决了。他问道，如果法国不承认突尼斯和摩洛哥人民的权利，它难道不该“受道义上的谴责”吗？查弗鲁拉汗说，他愿意补充一句，“北非事件给了西方国家一个证明它们的意图的机会。”
    印尼代表、外交部长苏纳约说，在这个被冷战弄得惶惶不安的世界中，印尼尽力执行着旨在实现世界和平的、独立的、积极的政策，从而避免被拖入冷战。他说，印尼将继续努力，来结束目前不正常的国际形势。他接着表明，印尼赞成举行圆桌会议来讨论朝鲜问题，参加会议的不仅是交战国家，而且要有虽未参加战争、但关心、同时可以有助于远东问题的解决的国家。苏纳约谴责法国在突尼斯和摩洛哥的政策，以及南非联邦的种族隔离政策，并要求加强国际合作以巩固世界和平。
    会议至此休会。
