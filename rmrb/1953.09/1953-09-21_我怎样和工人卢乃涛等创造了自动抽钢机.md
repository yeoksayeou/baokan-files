How I, Together with Workers Lu Naitao and Others, Created the Automatic Steel Drawing Machine

Assistant Engineer of Anshan Iron and Steel Small Factory, Wu Liangya

I helped my factory's labor model, Comrade Lu Naitao, and other comrades to create an automatic steel drawing machine for the heating furnace. After the automatic steel drawing machine replaced manual steel drawing, it not only increased heating efficiency by 20%, reduced reheating waste, and saved twenty-one laborers, but also basically eliminated occupational diseases such as burns and eye damage.

My ability to achieve some success is due to the cultivation and education of the Party.

I came to Northeast China from the Nanjing Power Plant with the Northeast recruitment team at the end of 1949. At the time, I thought that the industry in Northeast China had a foundation and that I could learn more things. If I learned well, I could become an "expert" in the future.

However, I never expected that when I was assigned work, I would be sent to the Second Workshop of the Anshan Iron and Steel Small Factory. At that time, everything was a mess, everything was being repaired, and it hadn't started operating yet.

I thought, why did the leadership send me, who is so "advanced," to a factory that has nothing? So I repeatedly asked the leadership to transfer my work.

After many patient assistance from the leadership, I finally settled down to work. However, my initial work was not done well. Formally, I was with the workers all day, but when I encountered problems, I went to find books. I thought, isn't the theoretical basis all from books?

Once, the rolling mill needed to replace a guide plate, so I opened a plan according to the procedure recorded in the book: first calculate the dimensions, then weld, and then install. Who knew that my plan was not finished yet, and workers such as Song Kailin had already pieced together several iron plates with a very simple method and installed them. When installing the resistor circuit for the motor starter, I thought it was very simple, but I couldn't find the answer in the book. As a result, the workers solved it effortlessly. This reminded me of what the Party often taught us, and it is also the working method we must follow, that is, it is not enough to simply hold books; we must put down our airs, be a student of the working masses, and learn from the workers.

One day, heating foreman Lu Naitao said to me: "Old Wu! Think of a way, can we pick up and try again the steel drawing machine that I researched in the past?"

In order to continue researching the steel drawing machine, I went to the engineers for research, but I ran into snags in two places. The hope of finding an engineer was shattered, so Lao Lu and I repeatedly researched and submitted our common opinions to the factory director. With the strong support of the leadership, the work of researching and improving the automatic steel drawing machine started smoothly.

In order to speed up the pusher rod, we suggested to the leadership to replace the original motor with a squirrel-cage type. The factory didn't have it, so the factory director gave a note to the warehouse to get it. After the motor was installed, there was a shortage of water pipes, so the factory director found someone to borrow from other factories. When electrical workers, riveters, and welders were needed in the work, the factory director transferred people to help. The leading comrades also constantly encouraged us and said: "Create the steel drawing machine successfully as soon as possible to welcome National Day!"

After the problem of the pusher rod speed was solved, we studied the two problems of automatic material drawing and automatic control of the pusher rod. I designed an automatic control circuit diagram, but I didn't know if it was appropriate or not. I went to Lao Lu for research, but Lao Lu didn't understand it very well. This stumped me. If I looked for an engineer, I was afraid it wouldn't work. If I did it according to my own ideas, I was afraid of messing up the work. Later, I thought, why not ask the workers for advice? Lao Lu and I went to electrical workers Li Chunquan, Yang Pengfei, Sun Shiping, and other comrades. After they looked at the drawing, they put forward many modification opinions. After they researched and improved the electrical contact interrupter, the steel drawing machine became an electrically operated power machine.

The problem of steel drawing machine automation was solved, and we happily started the experiment. However, in the experiment, new difficulties appeared one after another: the pusher rod trembled up and down, swayed left and right, and the pusher rod was not heat-resistant. After a long time of operation, it was bent by the furnace fire; the coordination between the operating workers of the steel drawing machine and the loading machine was inconsistent, etc. At this time, the trade union and the administration jointly held a forum for veteran workers and technicians, inviting workers familiar with machinery and electricity to specifically discuss the problem of the automatic steel drawing machine. This meeting solved fifteen mechanical problems and also solved the electrical problems of the linked operation of the loading machine and the steel drawing machine. For example, in order to control the trembling and swaying of the pusher rod machine, we adopted the method of adding idler rollers and vertical rollers; in order to prevent the pusher rod from being bent by burning, the original iron pipe pusher rod was replaced with a seamless steel pipe, and the cooling water was increased. In particular, after the veteran electrical worker Comrade Sun Shiping implemented the measure of combining the electrical control of the steel drawing machine and the loading machine into one distribution panel, as long as one worker presses the button, the steel drawing machine and the loading machine can push each other to operate, which is accurate and saves trouble. It fundamentally solved the problem of linked operation of the two machines.

When the second experiment was carried out, the steel drawing machine was completely easy to use; the workers sat far away from the heating furnace, and when they pressed the button, it quickly drew steel according to people's will.

With the success of the steel drawing machine, the inside of the furnace must also be transformed. In particular, if the problem of the uneven furnace bottom caused by iron oxide scale in the furnace is not solved, it will sometimes affect the advancement of the steel drawing machine. Everyone spent a lot of effort on this matter, but they couldn't think of a solution. When the Soviet experts learned about it, they proposed to change the steel pushing trough in the furnace to a high-chromium alloy cast steel refractory steel trough and made the drawings. The refractory steel trough is the best suggestion to completely solve the problem of uneven furnace bottom. Because it can withstand heat above two thousand degrees, and the furnace temperature is only about one thousand five hundred degrees, so it will not be burned, it will not melt iron scale, and the furnace bottom will not be increased due to the condensation of iron scale. However, I didn't expect that the first experiment with the refractory steel trough was opposed by some workers. Some workers saw that the refractory steel trough also burst out sparks like the original steel trough, so they shouted: "This is not easy to use, it's just melting iron!" and removed it. At this time, I realized that this was because I simply asked the workers to implement the expert's suggestions without explaining the benefits of the suggestions to them. Sure enough, after a detailed explanation later, the workers reinstalled it.

On December 10, 1952, our automatic steel drawing machine was officially operated.

In the process of researching and manufacturing the steel drawing machine, I deeply realized that a technician must rely on the leadership, learn and implement advanced Soviet experience, and implement the policy of combining labor and technology. This is also the direction of my future work.

    我怎样和工人卢乃涛等创造了自动抽钢机
    鞍钢小型厂助理工程师　吴良亚
    我帮助我厂劳动模范卢乃涛等同志，创造了加热炉自动抽钢机。自动抽钢机代替了人力抽钢以后，不仅提高了加热效率百分之二十，减少了再热铁，节省了二十一个劳动力，而且基本上消灭了烫伤、烧伤、害眼病等职业病。
    我所以能够作出一些成绩，是在党的培养教育下取得的。
    我是在一九四九年底，从南京电厂随东北招聘团来东北的。当时的想法是，东北的工业有基础，能学到更多的东西，学好了将来好作“专家”。
    可是，没想到一分配工作却把我派到鞍钢小型厂二车间来了。当时那里什么都乱七八糟，一切正在修复，还没开工。
    我想，我这样“先进”，领导上为什么把我派到这样一个要什么没什么的厂子来呢？于是三番五次找领导上要求调动工作。
    经过领导上多次的耐心帮助，后来我对工作总算安心了。但是我开头的工作并没作好。形式上整天和工人在一起，可是一碰到问题我就去找书本，我想，理论根据不都是由书上来的吗？
    有一次轧钢机那里要换一个导板，我就按书上所记载的先算尺寸、再熔接、然后安装的程序计划开了，那知道，我的计划还没做完，宋开林等工人已经用非常简单的方法把几块铁板拼凑起来安好了。安马达起动机抵抗器线路的时候，我认为很简单，可是由书上找不到答案，结果还是工人不费劲地就给解决了。这使我想起了党经常教导我们的，也是我们必须遵循的工作方法，那就是，单单捧书本是不行的；必须放下架子，当工人群众的小学生，向工人学习。
        有一天加热班长卢乃涛对我说：“老吴！想想办法，我过去研究的那个抽钢机，能不能再拣起来试试？”
    为了继续研究抽钢机，我去找工程师研究，可是去了两处都碰了钉子。找工程师的希望破灭了，于是我和老卢反复研究，并把我们两个人的共同意见，提给厂长，在领导上大力支持下，研究和改进自动抽钢机的工作，就顺利地开始了。
    为了加快推杆，我们建议领导上将原有马达换成鼠笼式的。厂里没有，厂长就批条子到仓库去领。马达安好了，又缺水管，厂长就找人到外厂去借。工作中需要电工、铆工、焊工的时候，厂长就调人来帮忙。领导同志还不断鼓励我们说：“早点把抽钢机创造成功，迎接国庆节！”
    推杆速度问题解决以后，我们又研究自动抽料和推杆自动控制两个问题。我设计了一个自动控制线路图，但不知合适不合适，找老卢研究，老卢又不大懂。这可把我难住了，找工程师吧，怕行不通，凭自己的意思做，又怕把工作弄糟了。后来一想，为什么不向工人请教呢？我和老卢去找电工李春泉、杨鹏飞、孙世平等同志，他们一看图就提出了不少修改意见。经他们研究和改进了电气接点切断器以后，才使抽钢机变成电气操纵的动力机械。
    抽钢机自动化的问题解决了，我们很高兴的开始试验了，但是，在试验当中，又接连的出现了新的困难：推杆上下颤动，左右摇摆，推杆不耐热，操作时间一长，就被炉火烧弯了；抽钢机和装入机的操作工人配合不一致等。这时工会就和行政共同召开了一个老工人、技术员座谈会，邀请熟悉机械和电气的工人，专门讨论解决自动抽钢机的问题。这一次会解决了十五项机械问题，也解决了装入机、抽钢机的联系操作的电气问题。如为了控制推杆机颤动摇摆，我们采用了加托辊和立辊的办法；为了防止推杆烧弯，就将原来铁管的推杆换成无缝钢管，加大了冷却水。特别是老电气工人孙世平同志，把抽钢机和装入机的电气控制，都拼入一个配电盘的措施实行以后，只要一个工人一按电钮，抽钢机和装入机就能互相推动着操作了，又准确又省事。根本解决了两个机械的联系操作问题。
    进行第二次试验的时候，抽钢机就完全好用了；工人坐在离加热炉很远的地方，一按电钮，它就随着人们的意志，迅速地抽钢了。
    随着抽钢机的成功，炉内也必须进行改造，尤其是炉内因氧化铁皮而造成的炉底不平的问题如不解决，有时就会影响抽钢机的推进。为了这件事大家没少花费脑筋，但都没想出办法来。苏联专家知道了，就提出把炉内推钢槽改为高铬合金铸钢的耐火钢槽，并将图制出。耐火钢槽是彻底解决炉底不平问题的最好建议。因为它可以耐热两千度以上，而炉温只有一千五百度左右，这样，它就不会被烧化，不会化铁皮，炉底也就不会因铁皮的凝结而增高。可是没想到在第一次试验用耐火钢槽的时候却遭到一部分工人的反对。有些工人看到耐火钢槽上也如同原来钢槽一样崩出火花，就嚷嚷开了，说：“这不好使，眼瞅着一样化铁！”把它卸掉了。这时，我才发觉，这是由于我只简单地叫工人执行专家建议，而没有向他们讲清建议的好处。果然，以后经过详细解释后，工人就又重新把它安上了。
    一九五二年十二月十日，我们的自动抽钢机正式操作了。
    在抽钢机的研究制造过程中，我深深体会到：一个技术人员必须依靠领导，学习贯彻苏联先进经验，贯彻劳技结合方针。这也就是我今后工作的努力方向。
