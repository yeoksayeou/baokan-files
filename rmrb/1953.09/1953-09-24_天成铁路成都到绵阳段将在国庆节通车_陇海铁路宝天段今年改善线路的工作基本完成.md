Xinhua News Agency:

    The Chengdu-Mianyang section of the Tiancheng Railway has been laid by September 17th and will officially open to traffic on National Day. On the 17th, the rail-laying workers of the Tiancheng Railway created the highest record for rail-laying efficiency on the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and the Tiancheng Railway, laying a total of 6 kilometers and 290 meters of rail that day.

    The Chengdu-Mianyang section of the Tiancheng Railway is 116 kilometers and 860 meters long. After laying the rails to Luojiang on August 19th, the employees building the Tiancheng Railway worked even harder to realize the plan to officially open the Chengdu-Mianyang section to traffic on National Day this year, overcoming various difficulties, and completed 92 large and small bridges and culverts, and completed 2,466,475 cubic meters of earthwork in one month. The employees also put forward many rationalization proposals, saving the country 6 billion yuan in the project from Mianyuan River to Mianyang Station alone. The workers in charge of erecting reinforced concrete bridges created a new record when erecting the Anchang River Bridge, the last bridge in Mianyang, achieving a record of erecting three and a half spans a day, completing the bridge erection task two days ahead of schedule.

    Now, people from all walks of life in Mianyang County are actively preparing to celebrate the opening of traffic on October 1st.

    In addition: The work of improving the railway line on the Baoji-Tianshui section of the Longhai Railway this year has been basically completed, and the line quality and transportation efficiency of this section have been further improved. The average travel speed of trains passing through the Baoji-Tianshui section has increased from 11.6 kilometers before the start of the line improvement project this year to 15.1 kilometers. The travel time from Baoji to Tianshui has also been reduced from 9 hours and 10 minutes to 6 hours and 8 minutes. The traction tonnage of medium-sized locomotives has increased by 360 tons compared to last year.

    The Baoji-Tianshui Railway was formerly known as the "appendix" of the Longhai Railway, and traffic was often blocked, with only one or two months of traffic time per year. In order to improve transportation efficiency, the railway department carried out a lot of repair and reinforcement work on the line from 1950 to 1952. This year, another 500,000 cubic meters of earthwork was done in terms of repairing the roadbed, more than 40 tunnels were lengthened or lined, dozens of bridges were reinforced, four new bridges and culverts were built, stone ballast was added to the road surface, sleepers were replaced, and the excessively curved poor lines were also removed. Now, the line quality mostly meets the standards.

    天成铁路成都到绵阳段将在国庆节通车
    陇海铁路宝天段今年改善线路的工作基本完成
    据新华社讯：天成铁路成都到绵阳段已在九月十七日铺好，国庆节就要正式通车。天成铁路铺轨工人在十七日创造了成渝铁路和天成铁路铺轨效率的最高纪录，当天共铺轨六公里又二百九十公尺。
    天成铁路成都到绵阳段共长一百一十六公里又八百六十公尺。修筑天成铁路的职工在八月十九日把铁轨铺到罗江后，为了实现成都到绵阳段在今年国庆节正式通车的计划，更加辛勤工作，战胜了各种困难，在一个月内修好大小桥涵九十二座，完成土石方工程二百四十六万六千四百七十五立方公尺。职工们并提出了许多合理化建议，仅在绵远河到绵阳车站的工程中，就为国家节省了六十亿元。担任架放钢筋混凝土桥梁的工人，在架放绵阳的最后一座桥梁安昌江大桥时，创造了新纪录，达到一天架三孔半的成绩，提前两天完成架桥任务。
    现在，绵阳县各界人民正积极筹备庆祝十月一日通车。
    又讯：陇海铁路宝（鸡）天（水）段今年度改善线路的工作已基本上做好了，该段的线路质量和运输效率已进一步提高。现在通过宝天段的列车平均旅行速度，已从今年度改善线路工程开始前的十一点六公里提高到十五点一公里，从宝鸡到天水的行车时间也从九时十分减少到六时八分；中型机车的牵引吨数比去年增加三百六十吨。
    宝天路向称陇海铁路的“盲肠”，交通常被阻塞，一年中只有一、二个月通车时间。为了提高运输效率，铁道部门从一九五零年到一九五二年做了许多整修加固线路的工作。今年在整修路基方面又做了五十万土石方，延长或衬砌隧道四十多座，加固桥梁几十座，新修桥涵四座，路面上加铺了石碴，抽换了枕木，太弯的不良线路也已去掉。现在，线路质量大部分合乎标准。
