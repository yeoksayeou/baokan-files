Xinhua News Agency, September 7th: New Delhi dispatch: Indian newspapers are criticizing Dulles' September 2nd speech to the American Legion convention regarding the Korean issue. "Amrita Bazar Patrika" commented on September 4th: "The secret collusion between the United States and the South Korean President, the bilateral treaty concluded between the United States and the South Korean government immediately after the armistice, the Sixteen-Nation Declaration clearly instigated by the United States, the tactics employed by the United States to turn the upcoming political conference into a 'two-sided' conference, and finally, Dulles' threat to Beijing based on the presumed reason that Beijing will not compromise at the political conference – all these are noteworthy facts." The newspaper stated that these facts "will not contribute to creating a peaceful atmosphere."

"The Times of India" called Dulles' speech a "rigid" speech on September 5th. The newspaper said: "The problem people are concerned about today is not the agenda that stipulates the order of discussing various issues, but the spirit shown in creating peace in Korea. The problem is that the South Korean President has repeatedly stated that if the unification he advocates is not achieved within a certain period, he will order his troops to attack the North. The problem is that the United States has an agreement with South Korea, and non-belligerent countries are not participating in the conference, while these countries could have mediated to facilitate a peaceful solution." The newspaper also said: "It is of little use for Dulles to guarantee that the U.S. government is prepared to discuss all Asian issues on a broad basis. What is needed now is not to say that the United States is prepared to discuss various issues in the future, but to immediately revise U.S. policy to make it conform to the requirements of peace."

Xinhua News Agency, August 8th: TASS, New York, September 7th: "New York Post" reporter Lash, commenting on the United States' attitude towards the upcoming political conference on the Korean issue, said: "Some of our allies have the impression that the United States is not eager to discuss its proposals on Korean unification because the United States wants to act unilaterally at the political conference, as it did at the recent United Nations General Assembly; reliable diplomatic sources say that the United States not only hopes to exclude India from the political conference, but is even trying to use a method that prevents Britain, France, and other countries that supplied troops to the Unified Command from having a real say at this conference. It is said that the United States' first suggestion is: the political conference should be a replica of the Panmunjom conference, the only difference being that diplomats should replace generals as representatives of the Unified Command."

    印报抨击杜勒斯企图破坏政治会议的演说
    美报记者指出英法等国担心美国在政治会议上独行其是
    【新华社七日讯】新德里消息：印度报纸抨击杜勒斯九月二日在美国退伍军人团代表大会上关于朝鲜问题的演说。“甘露市场报”在九月四日评论说：“美国与南朝鲜总统的暗中勾搭，美国在停战之后马上与南朝鲜政府缔结的双边条约，显然出于美国授意而发表的十六国宣言，美国为了使即将举行的政治会议成为‘两方’会议而玩弄的手段，最后杜勒斯以北京在政治会议上将不作妥协作为假定的理由而向北京进行的威胁——所有这些都是值得注意的事实。”该报说，这些事实是“不会有助于产生和平心理的”。
    “印度时报”在九月五日称杜勒斯的演说是一篇“顽固不化”的演说。该报说：“今天人们关心的问题不在于规定讨论各种问题的次序的日程表，而在于在朝鲜缔造和平工作时表现的精神。问题在于南朝鲜总统曾经一再说过，如果在一定时期内没有他所主张的那种统一，他将下令他的军队向北进攻。问题在于美国已和南朝鲜有过协议，同时会议中没有非交战国参加，而这些国家本来可以进行斡旋以利于和平解决的。”该报又说：“杜勒斯保证说，美国政府准备在广泛的基础上讨论所有亚洲问题，说这样的话并无多大好处。目前所需要的不是说美国准备在将来讨论各种问题，而是立即重新拟订美国的政策，使它合乎和平的要求。”
    【新华社八日讯】塔斯社纽约七日讯：“纽约邮报”记者拉希在评论美国对即将到来的关于朝鲜问题的政治会议中的态度时说：“我们的一些盟国有这种印象，即美国并不急于要讨论它对朝鲜统一问题的主张，因为美国想照着它在最近联合国大会上的做法，在政治会议上独行其是；可靠的外交界人士说，美国不仅希望把印度排斥在政治会议之外，甚至还试图运用一种办法，使英、法和其它供应军队给统一司令部的各国在这次会议上没有真正的发言权。据说，美国的第一个建议是：政治会议应该是板门店会议的翻版，两者唯一的区别是外交官应该代替将军作为统一司令部的代表。”
