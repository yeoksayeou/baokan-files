Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 28th – According to the provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement, both sides of the Korean armistice should directly repatriate all prisoners of war they hold who insist on repatriation to the side to which the prisoners of war originally belonged within sixty days after the armistice agreement takes effect. The Prisoner of War Repatriation Committee, responsible for specifically arranging this work within the stipulated time limit, should be dissolved by the Military Armistice Commission when both sides complete their plans for repatriating the aforementioned prisoners of war.

At the Military Armistice Commission meeting on September 28, U.S. side Chief Commissioner Major General Bryan believed that the Prisoner of War Repatriation Committee had completed its task and suggested that it be dissolved, and stated that if any issues related to prisoners of war who should be directly repatriated arise in the future, they could be handled by the staff officers of both sides of the Military Armistice Commission.

Korean and Chinese side Chief Commissioner Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho pointed out: Regarding the work of repatriating all prisoners of war who should be directly repatriated, in fact, only the Korean and Chinese side strictly abided by the agreement and completed it. All 12,773 United Nations forces prisoners of war it held who should be directly repatriated have been repatriated to the United Nations forces side; all 359 United Nations forces prisoners of war who were not directly repatriated have also been released into the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. Conversely, although the U.S. side had repatriated 75,781 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who should be directly repatriated to the Korean and Chinese side after the armistice, of the remaining 98,742 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war it held, in addition to the 22,602 who are said to have been handed over to the Indian custodial troops of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the U.S. side has not yet provided any account for 76,140 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. Given that the armistice agreement has been in effect for 63 days, and the deadline for repatriating prisoners of war who should be directly repatriated, which is also the prescribed working period of the Prisoner of War Repatriation Committee, has passed, the Korean and Chinese side agrees to dissolve the Prisoner of War Repatriation Committee, but the U.S. side still has full responsibility to promptly provide an honest account for the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war it admits to having held but has not yet provided to our side. In the future, matters concerning the direct repatriation of our prisoners of war by the U.S. side should be handled by the Military Armistice Commission.

    朝中方面同意解散战俘遣返委员会
    我方再次要美方交代七万余名我方被俘人员的下落
    【新华社开城二十八日电】根据朝鲜停战协定的规定，朝鲜停战双方应将其收容下一切坚持遣返的战俘，在停战协定生效后六十天内全部直接遣返给战俘原属的一方。负责在此规定期限内具体安排此一工作的战俘遣返委员会，应于双方遣返上述战俘的计划完成时即由军事停战委员会解散。
    在九月二十八日的军事停战委员会上，美方首席委员勃里安少将认为战俘遣返委员会已完成其任务，建议予以解散，并表示嗣后如发生与应予直接遣返的战俘有关的问题，可由军事停战委员会的双方参谋人员加以处理。
    朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将指出：关于遣返一切应予直接遣返的战俘的工作，事实上只有朝中方面严格遵守协议予以完成。它收容下的一万二千七百七十三名应予直接遣返的联合国军被俘人员，已全部被遣返交给联合国军方面；三百五十九名不直接遣返的联合国军被俘人员，也已全部被释交给中立国遣返委员会看管。反之，美方虽于停战后曾将七万五千七百八十一名应予直接遣返的朝中被俘人员遣返交给朝中方面，然而对其余曾在它收容下的九万八千七百四十二名朝中被俘人员，除二万二千六百零二名据称已交由中立国遣返委员会印度看管部队看管外，仍有七万六千一百四十名朝中被俘人员，美方迄今未作任何交代。鉴于停战协定已生效六十三天，遣返应予直接遣返的战俘之期限，也就是战俘遣返委员会的规定工作期限已经超过。朝中方面同意将战俘遣返委员会解散，但美方仍有完全责任对其所承认曾予收容，而至今未向我方作出任何交代的朝中被俘人员，迅速作出诚实的交代。今后有关美方直接遣返我方被俘人员的事宜，应由军事停战委员会处理。
