Xinhua News Agency, September 27th:

    Capital workers are greeting National Day with new achievements in the increase production and economy campaign. In recent days, new production records have continuously emerged from various factories and mines. From the 12th to the 24th, the iron smelting department of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant overfulfilled its production plan every day, with a maximum overfulfillment of 11.79%. Among them, the output of the No. 2 blast furnace on the 21st exceeded the quota by 13.69%, setting a new record since the establishment of the plant. The plant also created a new record of completing the overhaul of the No. 9 small blast furnace in eleven days and nine and a half hours, putting it into production seven and a half days ahead of schedule. Zhang Yushu's team of bricklayers from the No. 3414B construction site of the Beijing Fourth Construction Engineering Company created a new record of laying 4,800 bricks per person per day for foundation walls. The planing efficiency of the Houku construction site of the North China Directly Subordinate First Construction Engineering Company exceeded the quota by 2.14 cubic meters; the plastering efficiency of the 53027 construction site exceeded the quota by two times. As of the 24th, the Jingxi Mining Bureau had also overproduced 2,965 tons of coal, increasing the nation's wealth by a value of 329 million yuan.
    In the competition, workers have fully demonstrated their strong confidence and determination in building the motherland. Ma Shufan and Wang Guang, duty directors of the iron smelting department of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, jointly studied and proposed increasing the coke load to 0.15 and reducing the slag ratio to 0.074. Preliminary calculations estimate that the value of increased pig iron production and coke savings by the end of the year can reach 8.33 billion yuan. Gao Fenglong, a water system worker in the power department of the plant, learned from advanced Soviet experiences and used a toothless saw to saw steel pipes, increasing work efficiency by 24 times. Zhou Wenkui and Zhao Baochang's team in the forging workshop of the Beijing People's Machinery Factory improved tools and operating methods, saving 544 work hours in the manufacture of concrete mixer tie rod seats and doubling the production efficiency of tie rod joints. Engineering and technical personnel and management personnel have also joined the increase production and economy campaign. After the start of the competition, all technical personnel at the Shijingshan Power Plant went deep into the production teams to help workers discuss key issues and find shortcuts, and promptly made technical appraisals of workers' suggestions every day. Fu Zuoquan, an engineer at the Qinghe Woolen Mill, successfully researched increasing the speed of the No. 8 fine yarn spinning machine from 90 revolutions to 108 revolutions, which can increase production by 15%. Management personnel at the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory also improved production management work along with the increase in production efficiency during the competition.
    Currently, capital workers are doubling their efforts to strive to complete and overfulfill the September production plan to greet National Day. Workers at the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant will present an additional universal milling machine as a gift for National Day. Workers at the automobile dispatch room of the Beijing Electric Power Bureau are repairing two National Day gift vehicles. The first ten-ton steam roller successfully trial-produced by the Machinery Factory of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Construction Bureau will also leave the factory on National Day.

    首都工人以增产节约的新成就迎接国庆节
    【新华社二十七日讯】首都工人正以增产节约竞赛中的新成就迎接国庆节。连日来，各厂矿生产新纪录不断出现。石景山钢铁厂炼铁部从十二日到二十四日每天都超额完成生产计划，最多的一天超额完成计划百分之十一点七九。其中二高炉在二十一日的产量，更超过定额百分之十三点六九，创造了建厂以来的最高纪录。该厂并创造了十一天零九小时半完成大修九号小高炉的新纪录，比原计划提前七天半投入生产。北京市第四建筑工程公司三四一四乙字工地瓦工张玉树小组砌基础墙，创造了每人每日砌砖四千八百块的新纪录。华北直属第一建筑工程公司后库工地的刨槽效率超过定额二点一四立方公尺；五三○二七工地的抹灰效率超过定额两倍。京西矿务局到二十四日为止，也已超额生产了二千九百六十五吨煤，为国家增产了价值三亿二千九百多万元的财富。
    在竞赛中，工人们都充分表现了对建设祖国的坚强信心和毅力。石景山钢铁厂炼铁部值班主任马树番、王广共同研究出把焦炭负荷增大到零点一五，渣比减低到零点零七四，初步计算到年底增产生铁和节省焦炭的价值可达八十三亿三千万元。该厂动力部水道工人高凤龙学习苏联先进经验，用无齿锯锯钢管，工作效率提高了二十四倍。北京市人民机器厂锻工车间周文奎、赵宝昌小组，改进了工具和操作方法，使水泥搅拌机拉杆座的制造节省五百四十四个工时，拉杆接头的生产效率提高一倍。工程技术人员和管理人员也都投入了增产节约竞赛。石景山发电厂在竞赛开始后，技术人员全部深入到生产小组帮助工人讨论关键问题，找窍门，每天并把工人的建议及时作出技术鉴定。清河制呢厂工程师傅作全研究八号细纱纺毛机转数由九十转提高到一百零八转成功，可增产百分之十五。华北农业机械总厂管理人员也随着竞赛中生产效率的提高，改进了生产管理工作。
    目前，首都工人正加倍努力，争取完成和超额完成九月份的生产计划来迎接国庆。北京市第一机床厂工人以多制一部万能铣床作为国庆节献礼。北京电业局汽车调配室工人正在修配两辆国庆献礼车。北京市人民政府建设局机械厂已试制成功的第一部十吨蒸气压路碾，也将在国庆节出厂。
