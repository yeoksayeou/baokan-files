Xinhua News Agency commentator Jiang Nan commented on the voting results of the UN General Assembly regarding the composition of the Korean political conference: After the UN General Assembly concluded its session by voting on various proposals, American propagandists are loudly boasting about America's "great victory" in this session. However, to the misfortune of these people who are slapping their faces to look imposing, the facts themselves contradict their claims.

From the entire process of the UN General Assembly discussing the composition of the Korean political conference, it is clear how the United States' policy of power diplomacy has suffered a defeat this time. The United States, which has always held a majority in the United Nations, was in an unprecedentedly isolated position during this discussion. The United States' unreasonable attitude of insisting that the political conference should be limited to the belligerent parties and stubbornly excluding India from participating in the conference did not even receive the support of many of its "allies" who have always supported the United States during the discussion. Faced with such a situation, even Eleanor Roosevelt, who has consistently supported the US government's foreign policy, admitted in a statement issued on August 26 that the dispute over India's participation in the conference showed that the United States "is in a state of self-isolation... The support we (referring to the United States) have received on this issue is so little that this fact alone is enough to prove the warnings repeatedly raised by experienced international observers: Our (referring to the United States) prestige abroad has fallen to the lowest level since World War II."

During the UN General Assembly, American diplomats, holding big sticks and dollars, carried out large-scale activities behind the scenes, even bringing their running dog Syngman Rhee's so-called "Minister of Foreign Affairs" Pyun Yung-tae to the assembly, instructing him to frantically oppose India, thereby exerting pressure on the United States' "allies." They attempted to regain "face" during the final vote of the UN General Assembly. However, this commanding policy of the United States also failed to fully achieve its effect. The voting record of the proposal still shows that this attempt by the United States was a serious political failure and a complete moral bankruptcy.

Let's analyze the voting record of the proposal. The so-called "Fifteen-Nation Proposal" entirely arranged by the United States, which stipulates that the political conference should become a negotiation between the belligerent parties, was passed, but this proposal only received 43 votes in favor, which is only barely more than the two-thirds majority required to pass a proposal. If this is compared with the voting record of the proposal regarding the Soviet Union's participation in the political conference, which was passed by the UN General Assembly at the same time, there were 55 votes in favor of the Soviet Union's participation in the conference, which is 12 votes more than those supporting the US proposal.

Although the proposal regarding India's participation in the political conference was ultimately not put to a vote at the UN General Assembly plenary session due to the United States' strong opposition. However, the voting record of this proposal in the Political Committee has particularly sharply revealed the United States' isolation and lack of support. During the voting in the Political Committee, the United States only managed to put together 21 votes against this proposal. There were 27 votes in favor of this proposal and 11 abstentions. The only countries that followed the United States in voting against India's participation in the political conference were the United States' lackey countries in Latin America and the United States' two puppets, Greece and the Kuomintang. On this issue, all Asian and Arab countries, except Pakistan, did not support the United States. Except for Greece, none of the United States' "allies" in the North Atlantic Group supported the United States. Even among the countries that sent troops to invade Korea with the United States, except for Greece and Colombia, none supported the United States.

The United States' manipulation of the "majority" to pass the "Fifteen-Nation Proposal" and to prevent the proposal for India's participation in the political conference from being submitted to the General Assembly for a vote was only the result of the United States' use of enormous pressure on its "allies." Although the United States' pressure made these countries afraid to offend the United States in the end. However, these countries preferred to express their "rebellion" against the United States by abstaining. Associated Press reporter Jay MacRoberts had to admit in his report on August 27 that the United States achieved such a result "after exerting strong and unwelcome pressure on its friends. For example, Turkey and the Philippines decided to abstain when they really wanted to vote in favor of India (participating in the political conference)." "Most countries still believe that the United States is wrong to oppose India's participation in the conference and to advocate a bilateral meeting rather than a round-table meeting. ... Most countries say that the United States has never put forward any tenable moral reasons for opposing India's participation." Roberts was not without reason to worry and said: The cracks left by this "pressure tactic of the United States may remain for a long time in the future and poison it when other issues arise."

The United States clearly knew that its unreasonable claims and arrogant practices would only cause dissatisfaction and opposition even among its "allies", but it insisted on doing so. The general reason is that in the eyes of the United States, its "allies" are just its voting machines and there is no need to show any respect for their opinions. The more important reason is that the United States fears that the Korean armistice will lead to the relaxation of international tensions, thereby reducing the huge profits of its monopoly capital and possibly accelerating the outbreak of an economic crisis. Therefore, for any trend and any sign that may lead to the easing of the situation, even if it comes from its "allies," it will oppose it at all costs. The United States' intention is clearly to use this to force its "allies" to accept the United States' plan to sabotage the political conference and maintain tensions in the Far East. The entire actions of the United States at this UN General Assembly once again exposed this great conspiracy of the United States. This is worthy of serious attention.

    评联大关于政治会议组成问题的表决结果
    【新华社三十一日讯】新华社评论员江南评论联合国大会关于朝鲜政治会议组成问题的表决结果说：在联合国大会表决各项提案宣告闭幕后，美国宣传家们正在大吹大擂地吹嘘着美国在这次大会上获得了“大胜利”。但是，对于这些打肿了脸充胖子的人十分不幸的是，事实本身却和他们的说法相反。
    从联合国大会讨论朝鲜政治会议组成问题的整个过程中，可以清楚地看到美国强权外交政策这次遭到了怎样的失败。一向在联合国中挟持多数的美国，在这次讨论过程中居于空前的孤立的地位。美国坚持政治会议应限于交战双方参加，并顽固排斥印度参加会议的无理态度，在讨论过程中甚至没有获得向来支持美国的许多“盟国”的支持。面对着这样的景况，连一贯支持美国政府外交政策的罗斯福夫人也在八月二十六日发表的声明中承认：关于印度参加会议的争执说明，美国“陷于自我孤立状态……美国在这种问题上所得到的支持是这样的少，单单这个事实就足以证明有经验的国际观察家所一再提出的警告：我们（指美国）在国外的威信已降到第二次世界大战以来最低的水平。”
    在联合国大会期间，美国外交家们曾经手拿着大棒和美元，在幕后气喘喘地进行了大规模活动，甚至把他们的走狗李承晚的所谓“外务部长官”卞荣泰带进大会，指使他狂叫反对印度，借此来对美国的那些“盟国”横施压力。他们企图在联合国大会最后表决时能挽回“面子”。但是，美国这种发号施令政策也未能完全奏效。提案的投票记录依然表明美国的这种企图在政治上是遭到了严重的失败，在道义上更是彻底破产。
    来分析一下提案的投票记录吧。美国一手包办的规定政治会议应成为交战双方谈判的所谓“十五国提案”虽然是通过了，但是这个提案却只获得四十三票赞成，也就是只获得勉强超过通过一个提案所必需的三分之二多数的支持。如果把这来和联合国大会同时通过的关于苏联参加政治会议的提案的投票记录比较，支持苏联参加会议的有五十五票，比支持美国提案的要多十二票。
    尽管由于美国的竭力反对，关于印度参加政治会议的提案最后没有在联合国大会全体会议上付表决。然而，这个提案在政治委员会的表决记录却已特别尖锐地显示出美国的失道寡助的情况。在政治委员会表决时，美国只拼凑到二十一票来反对这个提案。赞成这个提案的有二十七票，弃权的有十一票。跟随美国投票反对印度参加政治会议的只有美国在拉丁美洲的喽啰国家和美国的希腊和国民党两个傀儡。在这个问题上，除了巴基斯坦外，所有亚洲和阿拉伯国家都没有支持美国。除了希腊以外，美国在北大西洋集团中的“同盟国”全都没有支持美国。甚至在与美国一道派遣军队侵略朝鲜的国家中，除希腊和哥伦比亚以外，也都没有支持美国。
    而美国操纵“多数”通过“十五国提案”，并使印度参加政治会议提案没有能在大会提出付表决，也只是美国对它的“盟国”施用了巨大压力的结果。美国的压力虽使得这些国家最后不敢再冒犯美国。但是这些国家却宁愿以弃权来表示他们对美国的“反叛”。美联社记者杰·麦·罗伯茨八月二十七日在其报道中不得不承认，美国得到这样的结果“是在对它的朋友施以强大的和不受欢迎的压力之后取得的。比如，土耳其和菲律宾就是在它们真正想投票赞成印度（参加政治会议）时决定弃权的”。“大多数国家仍然认为，美国反对印度参加会议并且主张采取双方会议的形式而不是圆桌会议的形式，是错误的。……多数国家说，美国在反对印度参加时，始终没有提出任何站得住脚的道义上的理由。”罗伯茨并且不是没有理由地担心说：这次“美国的压力策略所留下来的裂痕可能在今后长期留下来，而在其他问题发生时毒害它”。
    美国明知它的无理主张与蛮横作法即使在它的
    “盟国”中也只能引起不满和反对，但它却偏要这样作，一般的原因是，在美国眼中，它的“盟国”只是它的投票机器，用不着对他们的意见表示什么尊重。而更重要的原因则是美国唯恐朝鲜停战会导致国际紧张局势的缓和因而减少它的垄断资本的巨额利润，并可能加速经济危机的爆发。因此，对于可能引起缓和局势的任何趋势和任何迹象，即使是来自它的“盟国”，也必不顾一切，誓死反对。美国的意思显然是想借此来逼迫它的“盟国”接受美国破坏政治会议、维持远东紧张局势的计划。美国在这次联合国大会上的全部行径又一次暴露了美国的这个大阴谋。这是值得人们严重注意的。
