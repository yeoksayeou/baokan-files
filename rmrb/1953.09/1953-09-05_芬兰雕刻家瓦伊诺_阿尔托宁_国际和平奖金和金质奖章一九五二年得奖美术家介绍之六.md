Wäinö Aaltonen, the winner of the World Peace Council's International Peace Gold Medal in 1952, is one of Finland's most famous sculptors, born in 1894 in a small village in western Finland. His father was a stonecutter. From his early childhood, his artistic talent, especially his musical talent, was discovered. Later, due to deafness, he was unable to continue developing his musical talent. However, his sculptures still possess a musical harmony.

Wäinö Aaltonen graduated from the Turku Art School in 1915. After graduation, he initially worked as a painter, and later specialized in sculpture. He learned the traditional methods of local stonecutters for handling granite and gained a lot of experience. This was of great significance for his development in sculptural art.

Wäinö Aaltonen's most famous works are: "Son of Granite" – the statue of the wanderer Paavo Nurmi, and one of the four statues on the Tammerkoski bridge – "The Finnish Maiden." In addition, there are statues decorating the Finnish Parliament Hall, Alexis Kivi's tombstone, the Telvaara and cooperative movement monuments, the statue of Gödelberg, and many other busts, all of which are masterpieces.

Recently, Wäinö Aaltonen created a great work – "Peace." This work is the result of Wäinö Aaltonen's nearly twenty years of brewing and painstaking work. This is a technically exquisite work of art. The author expresses the people's firm will to strive for peace through the image of a woman. The woman's expression is healthy, beautiful, and sublime. She stands, raising her hands high, with a shawl folded and drooping down on both sides of her body. Her facial expression is profound and firm, successfully showing a strong desire to resist the darkness and suffering of life and to yearn for a peaceful and happy life. This is an important work with the theme of defending peace. He won the International Peace Gold Medal for this work.

    芬兰雕刻家瓦伊诺·阿尔托宁
    ——国际和平奖金和金质奖章一九五二年得奖美术家介绍之六

    世界和平理事会国际和平金质奖章一九五二年得奖者瓦伊诺·阿尔托宁，是芬兰著名雕刻家之一，一八九四年生于芬兰西部的一个小村落里。他的父亲是个凿石工人。从他幼年的时候起，他的艺术天才，尤其是音乐天才，就被人们所发现。后来他因为耳聋，无法继续发展他的音乐天才。但他的雕刻作品，仍然具备着音乐一般的和谐。
    瓦伊诺·阿尔托宁在一九一五年毕业于土尔库艺术学校。毕业后，最初做绘画师，后来专门致力于雕刻。他学习了当地凿石匠的处理花岗石的传统方法，获得了许多经验。这对于他在雕刻艺术上的发展是有重要意义的。
    瓦伊诺·阿尔托宁最有名的作品是：“花岗石之子”——流浪者巴乌·奴尔米的塑像和塘贝雷桥上四个塑像中的一个——“芬兰贞女”。此外还有装饰在芬兰国会会议厅的塑像、阿雷克锡斯·凯维的墓碑、台尔瓦雷和合作运动的纪念碑、哥德贝尔格的塑像，以及其他许多半身像，都是杰作。
    最近，瓦伊诺·阿尔托宁塑造了一个伟大的作品——“和平”。这个作品是瓦伊诺·阿尔托宁经过将近二十年之久的酝酿与精心工作的成果。这是一件技巧精湛的艺术品。作者通过一个妇女的形象来表现人们坚决争取和平的意志。这个妇女的神态是健美而崇高的，她站立着，高举着双手，披肩沿着身驱两旁摺叠地下垂，面部表情深刻而坚定，很成功地显示了反抗黑暗与苦难生活、渴求和平与幸福生活的强烈的愿望。这是以保卫和平为主题的一件重要作品。他以这件作品获得国际和平金质奖章。
