    Victory in the Yangtze River Navigation Channel Survey
    The entire Yangtze River (the section from Yichang to Chongqing on the upper reaches of the Yangtze) navigation channel survey has been successfully completed. The Yangtze River is approximately 648 kilometers long. Before liberation, due to the dangerous shoals of the Three Gorges (namely Xiling Gorge, Wu Gorge, and Qutang Gorge), the abundance of reefs, the swift currents, and the ease with which ships could strike reefs during floods, and the inability of ships to navigate during the dry season, and because the Yangtze River lacked navigational aids, ships could not travel at night, which seriously affected transportation. Shortly after liberation, the Ministry of Transportation of the Central People's Government decided to improve the Yangtze River channel, install new Soviet-style navigational aids, and open up night navigation. In February 1952, the Ministry organized the Yangtze River Survey Committee to begin surveying the Yangtze River channel, and after one year and four months of arduous work, it was successfully completed in June of this year. This has solved the difficulty of ships not being able to navigate at night and has improved operating efficiency. It is estimated that the Yangtze River Navigation Administration can increase its income by 50 billion yuan this year. (Gui Tiqing)

    川江航道测量工作胜利完成
    川江（长江上游宜昌到重庆段）全线航道测量工作胜利完成。川江全长约六百四十八公里，解放前因三峡（即西陵峡、巫峡、瞿塘峡）滩险，礁石林立，水流湍急，洪水期间船只容易触礁，枯水季节船只无法航行，又因为川江没有航标设备，船只不能夜航，严重的影响了交通运输。解放后不久，中央人民政府交通部便决定改进川江航道，设置苏联新式航标，开辟夜航。一九五二年二月该部组织了川江测量委员会，开始测量川江航道，经过一年零四个月的艰苦工作，于今年六月胜利完成。这样就解决了船只不能夜航的困难，提高了营运效率。估计长江航务局今年可增加收入五百亿元。（桂提清）
