    Farmers in Disaster-stricken Areas of Fushan County Seize the Time for Autumn Cultivation After Draining Water
    A letter from readers Li Depu and others from Fushan County, Shandong Province: After many lands in the first and second districts of Fushan County were flooded, the local government vigorously mobilized farmers to drain water and save seedlings. The late autumn crops have survived after rescue efforts, such as beans that are flowering and podding, and sweet potatoes that are growing well. As a result, the production enthusiasm of the disaster-stricken farmers has greatly increased. Now, except for a few low-lying areas where drainage is very difficult, most of the fields have dried.
    In order to seize the favorable opportunity and sow wheat in time, the Party and government leading organs in the first district studied how to rationally utilize the district's plowing animals for autumn cultivation in early August. The six townships of Pengzhuang, Shitouji, and Dongcaoqiaotou in the district originally had 1,146 head of cattle, 237 donkeys, and 4 horses, which could be matched with a total of 468 plowing pairs. In early August, the cadres of these six townships mobilized farmers to repair plows and traces, while cutting sorghum stalks and carrying out autumn cultivation, so as not to be unable to cultivate when the land dried up. At the same time, a forum for cattle owners was held to conduct education on mutual assistance and friendship, mobilizing cattle owners to seize the time for early cultivation, so that after finishing plowing, they could lend the cattle to households without cattle. The Zhang Shibin mutual aid group in Tulou Village, Pengzhuang Township, has now organized and matched plowing pairs. Cattle-owning households are seizing the time for autumn cultivation and guaranteeing to help households without cattle to cultivate the land, so that they will not plant wheat late. They also studied a reasonable method for finding grass, stipulating that 60 catties of grass should be provided to the cattle owner for plowing one mu of land, which the cattle owners were very satisfied with. At present, more than 300 plowing animals in these six townships have gone down the slopes to cultivate the land. If calculated at three mu of land plowed per pair per day, the autumn land in these six townships can be cultivated around September 10th.

    凫山县受灾地区的农民排水后抓紧时机进行秋耕
    山东省凫山县读者李德普等来信：凫山县一、二两区不少土地经洪水冲淹后，当地政府就大力发动农民排水救苗。晚秋作物经抢救后都已成活，如豆子正在开花结荚，地瓜也长的不错。因此，受灾农民的生产情绪大为提高。现在除了排水十分困难的少数洼地外，大部田地都已干皮。
    为了抓紧有利时机及时播种小麦，一区党政领导机关在八月上旬就研究了怎样合理利用全区的耕畜进行秋耕的问题。该区彭庄、石头集、东曹桥头等六个乡原有耕牛一千一百四十六头、驴子二百三十七头、马四匹，共可搭配耕犋四百六十八犋；这六个乡的干部在八月上旬便动员农民整修犁杖、经索，一面砍高粱秆子一面进行秋耕，免得地干了耕不动。同时，又召开了牛主座谈会，进行互助友爱的教育，动员有牛户抓紧早耕，以便耕完了就把牛借给无牛户使用。彭庄乡土楼村张士斌互助组各户目前已整理搭配好耕犋，有牛户都正抓紧秋耕，并保证一定帮助无牛户耕地，不叫无牛户麦子种晚了。他们还研究了合理找草的办法，规定借牛耕一亩地找给牛主六十斤草，牛主都很满意。目前，这六个乡已有三百多犋耕畜下坡耕地。若以每犋每天耕地三亩计算，这六个乡的秋地到九月十日前后就可以耕完。
