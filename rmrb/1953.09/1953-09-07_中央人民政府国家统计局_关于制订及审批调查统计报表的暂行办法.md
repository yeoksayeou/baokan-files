Central People's Government State Statistical Bureau
Interim Measures for the Formulation and Approval of Statistical Reporting Forms and Survey Plans

I. In order to carry out the investigation and statistical work of the national statistical system and business systems in a planned and systematic manner, and to prevent the abuse of forms by various departments and regions, so as to ensure that the investigation and statistics necessary for national construction can be effectively implemented, these measures are formulated in accordance with the principle of the State Council's "Decision on Strengthening Statistical Institutions and Strengthening Statistical Work" and the State Council's "Instructions on Clearing Up Existing Investigation and Statistical Forms and Prohibiting the Random Issuance of Investigation and Statistical Forms."

II. All levels of government agencies, enterprises, and organizations throughout the country shall handle the issuance of statistical reporting forms and survey plans, whether periodic or one-time, simple or complex, in accordance with these measures.

III. The authority of government agencies, enterprises, and organizations to formulate statistical reporting forms and survey plans, and the approval procedures, are stipulated as follows:

(1) Uniform national periodic basic statistical reporting forms concerning the national economy, culture, education, health, and social conditions, as well as national one-time survey plans, shall be drafted by the Central People's Government State Statistical Bureau in conjunction with the relevant central departments and issued by the State Statistical Bureau. Particularly important parts shall be submitted to the Central People's Government State Planning Commission for approval and issuance.

(2) In order to meet the needs of local governments, the statistical bureaus of the Greater Administrative Areas may formulate and issue periodic statistical reporting forms and one-time survey plans to be conducted within the administrative area, and report them to the Central People's Government State Statistical Bureau for record. Important periodic statistical reporting forms shall be submitted to the Central People's Government State Statistical Bureau for approval. Important one-time survey plans shall be submitted to the Administrative Committee (or Financial and Economic Committee) of the Greater Administrative Area for approval. The statistical bureaus (sections) of provinces and cities may formulate and issue periodic statistical reporting forms and one-time survey plans to be conducted within the province or city, and report them to the statistical bureau of the Greater Administrative Area for record. Important periodic statistical reporting forms shall be submitted to the statistical bureau of the Greater Administrative Area for approval. Important one-time survey plans shall be submitted to the People's Government (or Financial and Economic Committee) of the province or city for approval.

All periodic statistical reporting forms or one-time survey plans involving enterprises directly under the central ministries shall have their forms and instructions copied to the relevant central ministries.

(3) The approval procedures for periodic business statistical reporting forms (including technical and economic statistical reporting forms) and one-time survey plans formulated by the central and local business departments for implementation within their own systems are as follows:

Periodic business statistical reporting forms and one-time survey plans formulated by the central commissions, ministries, committees, academies, bureaus, banks, and their subordinate professional management agencies (including central professional management agencies located in the Greater Administrative Areas) shall be reviewed by the statistical institutions of each department, approved by the head of each department, and reported to the Central People's Government State Statistical Bureau for record.

Periodic business statistical reporting forms and one-time survey plans formulated by the business departments of the Greater Administrative Areas and provinces and cities shall be approved by the head of each department and reported to the statistical bureau (section) at the same level and the higher-level business department for record. Those that need to be issued to enterprises directly under the central government but under the guidance of local business departments must be submitted to the central business department for approval and reported to the Central People's Government State Statistical Bureau for record.

(4) The approval procedures for periodic business statistical reporting forms and one-time survey plans formulated by central and local business departments that need to be issued to other government departments, business systems, people's organizations, public and private enterprises, or urban and rural residents for completion are as follows:

Periodic business statistical reporting forms and one-time survey plans formulated by the central departments and their subordinate professional management agencies (including central professional management agencies located in the Greater Administrative Areas) shall be reviewed by the head of each department and reported to the Central People's Government State Statistical Bureau for approval.

Periodic business statistical reporting forms and one-time survey plans formulated by the business departments of the Greater Administrative Areas shall be reviewed by the head of the department and submitted to the statistical bureau of the Greater Administrative Area for approval, and reported to the Central People's Government State Statistical Bureau and the central competent department for record. Important periodic business statistical reporting forms shall be reviewed by the statistical bureau of the Greater Administrative Area and forwarded to the Central People's Government State Statistical Bureau for approval; important one-time survey plans shall be reviewed by the statistical bureau of the Greater Administrative Area and forwarded to the Administrative Committee (or Financial and Economic Committee) of the Greater Administrative Area for approval.

Periodic business statistical reporting forms and one-time survey plans formulated by the business departments of provinces and cities shall be reviewed by the head of the department and submitted to the statistical bureau (section) of the province or city for approval, and reported to the statistical bureau of the Greater Administrative Area and the higher-level business department for record. Important periodic business statistical reporting forms shall be reviewed by the statistical bureau (section) of the province or city and forwarded to the statistical bureau of the Greater Administrative Area for approval; important one-time survey plans shall be reviewed by the statistical bureau (section) of the province or city and forwarded to the People's Government (or Financial and Economic Committee) of the province or city for approval.

(5) Municipalities under the jurisdiction of provinces, administrative offices, and county people's governments shall generally not issue periodic statistical reporting forms; if it is necessary to conduct a one-time survey, the survey plan shall be studied by the statistical institution and reported to the head of the local government for approval, and reported to the provincial statistical bureau (section) for record; important ones must be reported to the provincial statistical bureau (section) for approval.

If a municipality under the jurisdiction of a province needs to issue periodic statistical reporting forms for special reasons, it shall be reviewed by the municipal statistical bureau (section) and sent to the provincial statistical bureau (section) for approval, and reported to the statistical bureau of the Greater Administrative Area for record.

(6) People's organizations shall not issue periodic statistical reporting forms to non-affiliated units, public and private enterprises, or urban and rural residents. If people's organizations at or above the provincial and municipal levels need to issue a one-time survey plan to government agencies, public and private enterprises, or urban and rural residents for special needs, they must first consult with the relevant parties and then submit it to the state statistical authority at the same level for review and forwarding to the people's government at the same level for approval. If the scope of the survey is quite extensive, it shall be reviewed by the local statistical bureau (section) and forwarded to the higher-level state statistical authority for approval.

IV. After the statistical reporting forms and survey plans are approved, the approving authority shall send the forms and instructions to the designated recording authority for record, and the issuing authority shall send copies of the forms and instructions to the relevant Greater Administrative Areas, provinces, and municipalities statistical bureaus (sections) at the same time as the forms are issued, in order to handle them jointly.

V. Statistical reporting forms and survey plans may be issued and implemented after being approved by the legal authority. If the recording authority considers it inappropriate, it may submit opinions to the approving authority for reconsideration.

VI. Statistical reporting forms and survey plans formulated by state statistical authorities at all levels and business departments at all levels shall not duplicate or conflict with the statistical reporting forms and survey plans formulated and approved by higher-level statistical authorities and higher-level business departments.

VII. If it is necessary to amend, supplement, or abolish the approved statistical reporting forms, the form-making authority shall submit it to the original approving authority for consent; if it is proposed by the approving authority, it may directly notify the form-making authority to comply. All statistical reporting forms that have been amended, supplemented, or abolished shall be reported for record in accordance with the above provisions, and the relevant recipient agencies and filling units shall be notified separately.

VIII. Statistical reporting forms and survey plans issued in accordance with the approval procedures stipulated in these measures are legal reporting forms, and the issuing authority shall be responsible for their effective implementation.

All legal reporting forms must indicate the form number, the name of the form-making authority, the name of the approving authority, the approval date and document number, and the reporting date of the report in the upper right corner of the form. All statistical reporting forms and written investigation outlines similar to statistical reporting forms that have not been issued in accordance with the approval procedures are illegal reporting forms, and government agencies, enterprises, and organizations at all levels shall be responsible for exposing them and refusing to fill them out.

IX. The right to interpret the approved statistical reporting forms and survey plans belongs to the form-making authority.

X. The approving authority of statistical reporting forms and survey plans shall compile and bind the statistical reporting form formats, survey plans, and instructions approved by the agency in the quarter into a volume on a quarterly basis, and compile a catalog (form attached), and report them to the Central People's Government State Statistical Bureau for reference. The above-mentioned approving authority and issuing authority shall also pay attention to simplifying or abolishing repetitive or unnecessary reports approved and issued by the agency, and report the simplified or abolished reports to the Central People's Government State Statistical Bureau on a quarterly basis, in addition to notifying the recipient agency and filling unit.

XII. The central business departments and the statistical bureaus (sections) of the Greater Administrative Areas, provinces, and municipalities may formulate detailed implementation rules based on these measures and report them to the Central People's Government State Statistical Bureau for record.
