The Party's Leadership over Local Publishing Undertakings

    The "Pravda" published an editorial on August 29, pointing out the significance of strengthening the Party's leadership over local publishing bureaus. The abstract is as follows:

    The Party's correct leadership of publishing bureaus is a guarantee of the success of the work of publishing bureaus. Local publishing bureaus are generally directly subordinate to the cultural ministries of each republic. However, local Party organizations should not stand idly by regarding the work of this important ideological organ. Wherever Party leadership is ensured, wherever Party organizations have a highly strict requirement of the cultural ministry's publishing bureaus and publishing management organs, the task of publishing good books needed by the people is accomplished more smoothly.

    However, it should be pointed out that many local Party committees have not wholeheartedly led the publishing bureaus, thus missing a large number of opportunities to improve the work of Marxist-Leninist propaganda, improve the political education of the masses, and strengthen the Party's influence in the process of completing economic and political tasks. Some Party state committees and border region district committees have simplified the work of leading publishing bureaus into individual, intermittent interventions. They do not understand the cadres of publishing organs well enough, do not deeply study the content of their work, and rarely analyze published books. Therefore, it is no wonder that many publishing bureaus cannot complete the tasks they are responsible for.

    Some local Party organizations have not done enough to cultivate publishing organ staff with a high degree of principle and an uncompromising spirit towards ideological shortcomings and errors. They rarely care about improving the political and ideological level of publishing and editing staff. It is the responsibility of the Party committee to stop this kind of situation, strive to improve the ideological level of the work of publishing organs, strive to further improve the quality of books, and resolutely struggle against the phenomenon of publishing shoddy works.

    Local Party committees have not fully helped various publishing bureaus attract experienced Party and Soviet workers to write books. Many publishing bureaus fail to complete their plans for publishing works on Party and Soviet construction issues every year. It is the direct responsibility of the Party committee to constantly care about improving the quality of the writer members of various publishing bureaus.

    The primary Party organizations of each publishing bureau play a considerable role in completing the tasks undertaken by local publishing bureaus. Their main work is to improve the theoretical level of cadres, strengthen production discipline, promote initiative and creativity, and educate publishing and editing staff with a spirit of tirelessly trying to meet the growing political and cultural demands of the masses.

Opposing Dogmatism and Mechanical Memorization in Propaganda Work

    "Pravda" published an article entitled "Opposing Dogmatism and Mechanical Memorization in Propaganda Work" on August 4.

    The abstract is as follows:

    Propaganda and agitation are the most important departments in the Party's ideological work. The shortcomings of the content of propaganda and agitation are often reflected in other departments of ideological work.

    One of the most significant shortcomings in newspaper propaganda and oral propaganda is the dogmatic and mechanical memorization method used in narrating materials in many theoretical and propaganda articles published in newspapers and magazines, and in oral speeches and reports. Dogmatism and mechanical memorization bring great harm to the cause of Marxist-Leninist propaganda, and they prevent our cadres from correctly understanding the policies of the Communist Party and the Soviet government.

    Dogmatism often manifests itself as the mechanical application of these or those theoretical conclusions that are correct under specific historical conditions to all occasions in life. When elaborating on practical materials, one often does not deeply analyze historical events, does not show how the Party creatively applies the principles of Marxism-Leninism, and does not explain the reasons for generating new slogans and changing strategies.

    Practice in ideological work shows that many of our propaganda workers, unfortunately, use scholastic and mechanical memorization methods in conducting oral propaganda and newspaper propaganda. Other propaganda workers often reduce the detailed explanation of the theoretical conclusions of Marxist scientific theory to completely citing and memorizing formulas. The mechanical memorization style in propaganda work hinders the creative study of Marxist-Leninist theory.

    The method of using quotations exposes the propaganda workers' inability to handle materials, which they must understand very well in order to do a good job of oral or newspaper propaganda. Propaganda workers cite a large number of quotations without giving a vivid narrative of the issues being studied, which completely separates the materials necessary for research from life.

    It is common to cite dozens of quotations in propaganda articles, speeches, and seminars. One quotation follows another, often cited without any connection or even any necessity.

    The article "Stalin on the Objective Nature of Scientific Laws" published by Comrade Got, secretary of the Odessa State Committee, in the "Communist Banner" newspaper in April this year, and the article "The Knowability of the World and its Laws" published by Comrade Popik, a lecturer of the Stavropol Border Region Party Committee, in the "Stavropol Truth" newspaper in December 1952, can be taken as examples. These two articles are filled with so many quotations that the author's words essentially no longer exist.

    Of course, it is incorrect to think that quotations are completely forbidden, and that citing various authoritative sources should be condemned. That is not the case. Citations are completely permissible and justified, and the whole issue lies in whether the quotations are cited in a truly necessary way.

    The mechanical memorization style in propaganda work is also manifested in some publishing bureaus' indiscriminate publication of annotated pamphlets on the classic works of Marxism-Leninism. The number of pages in these pamphlets often greatly exceeds the classic works they discuss. The language of the annotators is completely dry and stilted. The "popularized" works written by these annotators appear poor to readers, and sometimes even distort the original works. Not long ago, these pamphlets simply flooded bookstores. These pamphlets are of little benefit, and sometimes even harmful to the mastery of Marxist-Leninist theory, because they attract people not to study the original works, that is, not to study the original works of Marxist-Leninist classic writers, and not to study the resolutions of Party congresses, Party representative conferences, and the Party Central Committee itself.

    Dogmatism and mechanical memorization are also prevalent in scientific work. In recent years, a considerable number of dissertations have lost their true and creative research on certain issues. For some dissertations, the authors prefer to take the easiest route: writing dissertations of a compilation nature, which are an overview, or more accurately, a collection of various propositions on a certain issue. This is certainly easier than creatively and proficiently exploring a certain issue. But it is doubtful whether one can obtain benefits from these mostly mechanically memorized dissertations.

    As practice shows, in propaganda work, one can see two extremes in the issue of the relationship between theory and current life. Some individual propaganda workers tell the history of the Party as if they are telling a chronicle of revolutionary events, telling a history that has long passed, and do not connect the theoretical principles being studied with current life, even when the urgency is very obvious. However, one can also encounter facts where connecting with current life is reduced to selecting accidental, secondary facts and "urgent" examples, or using narrow, practical current affairs discussions that are far from the theoretical materials being studied to replace theoretical analysis.

    Only by profoundly studying and comprehending life itself from the Marxist-Leninist standpoint is it possible to eliminate the mechanical memorization style of propaganda work, and to clearly and profoundly elucidate Marxism-Leninism in action, rather than solidified into formulas.

    苏联报刊论文摘要
    党对地方出版事业的领导
    “真理报”八月二十九日发表社论，指出加强党对地方出版局的领导的意义。摘要如下：
    党对出版局的正确领导，是使出版局的工作获得成绩的保证。地方出版局照例直接隶属于各共和国的文化部。但是当地的党组织对于这一重要的思想机关的工作也不应袖手旁观。凡是保证了党的领导，凡是党组织对文化部的出版局和出版管理机关有着高度严格要求的地方，人民所需要的良好书籍的出版任务就完成得比较顺利。
    但是应当指出，许多地方党委会没有尽心地领导出版局，因而也就把改进马克思列宁主义宣传工作的大量机会，改进群众政治教育工作和在完成经济政治任务过程中加强党的影响的大量机会放过去了。有些党的州委会和边疆区的区委会把领导出版局的工作简化成为个别的、间或的干预行动。它们对出版机关的干部了解得很不够，没有深入地研究他们工作的内容，很少对出版的书籍进行分析。因此无怪许多出版局不能完成它们所负的任务了。
    一些地方党组织对于以高度原则性、以对思想缺点和错误的不妥协精神来培养出版机关工作人员这一项工作，作得很不够。它们很少关怀出版编辑工作人员政治思想水平的提高。党委会的责任就是要制止这类情况，力求提高出版机关工作的思想水平，争取进一步改进书的质量，对出版粗劣作品的现象进行坚决的斗争。
    地方党委会没有充分帮助各出版局吸引有经验的党和苏维埃工作人员来写作书籍。很多出版局在出版有关党和苏维埃建设问题的著作方面，每年都完不成计划。党委会的直接责任，就是要经常关怀各出版局作家成员的质量的改进。
    各出版局的基层党组织在完成地方出版局所负的任务方面，起着不小的作用。它们的主要工作就是提高干部的理论水平，加强生产纪律，发扬主动的创造性，以一种不倦地设法满足日益增长的群众方面政治上和文化上的要求的精神教育出版编辑工作人员。
    反对宣传工作中的教条主义和死背条文的作风“真理报”八月四日发表了一篇以“反对宣传工作中的教条主义和死背条文作风”为题的论文。
    摘要如下：
    宣传和鼓动是党的思想工作中最重要的一个部门。宣传与鼓动内容的缺点常反映于思想工作的其他部门中。
    报刊宣传与口头宣传中，最重大的缺点之一是在报章杂志所发表的许多理论性论文与宣传论文中，以及在口头讲演与报告中，叙述材料时所使用的教条主义和死背条文的方法。教条主义和死背条文的作风为马克思列宁主义的宣传事业带来巨大损害，它们妨碍我们干部去正确理解共产党与苏维埃政府的政策。
    教条主义往往表现为把这些或那些在具体历史条件下是正确的理论性结论机械地运用到生活中的一切场合。在阐述实际材料时往往不去深刻地分析历史事件，不表明党如何创造性地运用马克思列宁主义的原理，没有说明产生新口号，改变策略的原因。
    思想工作方面的实践表明：我们的许多宣传工作者在进行口头宣传与报刊宣传中，不幸竟使用了学究式的、死背条文的方法。另一些宣传工作者则往往把对马克思主义科学理论上的结论的详尽解释归结为全部引证背熟的公式。宣传工作中的死背条文作风妨碍了对马克思列宁主义理论的创造性的研究。
    运用引文的方法暴露了宣传工作者无力处理材料，对于这些材料，他们为要作好口头宣传或报刊宣传是必须很好地理解的。宣传工作者援引了大量引文，而不对所研究的问题作生动的叙述，这就使为进行研究所必需的材料完全和生活脱节。
    在宣传论文，演说，座谈会中往往有引用几十条引文的情事。一个引文跟着一个引文，往往毫无联系地、甚至无丝毫必要地被引证着。
    敖德萨州委会书记戈特同志在今年四月“共产主义旗帜”报上所发表的论文“斯大林论科学法则的客观性质”，和斯达夫罗宝里边疆区党委会讲师波皮克同志在一九五二年十二月在“斯达夫罗宝里真理报”上所发表的论文“世界的可认识性及其规律性”可以为例，这两篇文章中塞满了这么多的引文，以致作者的话实质上已不存在。
    当然，认为完全不允许引文，认为援引各种权威的来源就要遭到谴责，这是不正确的。不是这样。引证完全是可以允许，并且也是正当的，全部问题在于引文援引得是否真正必要。
    宣传工作中的死背条文的作风也表现在一些出版局滥出有关马克思列宁主义经典著作的注释性的一些小册子。这些小册子的页数往往大大超过它们所论述的那些经典著作。注释者的语言完全干燥滞涩。这类注释者所写的“通俗化”作品在读者面前显得贫乏，有时甚至是曲解原著。不久以前这些小册子简直是充斥各个书店。这些小册子益处很少，有时甚至有害于马克思列宁主义理论的掌握，因为它们吸引人们不去研究原著，亦即不去研究马克思列宁主义经典作家的原作，不去研究党代表大会、党代表会议以及党中央委员会的决议本身。
    教条主义和死背条文的作风在科学工作中也流行着。近几年来相当数量的学位论文都失去了对于某种问题的真正的、创造性的研究。某些学位论文，作者宁愿走最容易的道路：写带有编纂性质的学位论文，这种论文是一种概述，更准确地说，是关于某一问题的各种主张的汇集。这当然比创造性地熟谙事理地来探讨一定的问题要容易得多。但是从这些在大多数情况下是死背条文的学位论文中能否获得益处则是值得怀疑的。
    正如实践所表明的，在宣传工作中可以看到在对待理论与现时生活联系问题上的两种极端。一些个别的宣传工作者讲述党的历史，好像讲述革命事件的编年史，讲述时日过去已久的历史一样，并且不将所研究的理论原理与现时生活联系起来，甚至在迫切性已很明显的时候。但是，也可以遇见这样一些事实：把联系现时生活归结为选择偶然的，次要的事实和“迫切的”例证，或者是用狭隘的，和所研究的理论材料关系很远的实际当前事务的讨论来代替理论上的分析。
    只有站在马克思列宁主义立场上来深刻地研究和体会生活本身，才有可能消除宣传工作的死背条文作风，明朗而深刻地阐明行动中的，而不是凝结为公式的马克思列宁主义。
