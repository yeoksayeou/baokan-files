Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 10th: September 9th marked the fifth anniversary of the founding of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Newspapers in Pyongyang published celebratory editorials.

    The "Democratic Korea Daily" editorial was titled: "Long Live the Glorious Motherland - The Democratic People's Republic of Korea!" The editorial pointed out: With the assistance of the great Soviet army, the Korean people freed themselves from Japanese imperialist colonial rule, gained liberation, established a people's government, implemented various democratic reforms, and created the Democratic People's Republic. This is the only and most correct path for the Korean people. Without doing so, our Korean people could not have become victors in the fierce struggle against foreign imperialism and domestic reactionary forces. Through the three-year Fatherland Liberation War, the Korean people not only heroically defended the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and further enhanced its international prestige, but also made the ringleaders of contemporary imperialism – the US imperialist warmongers – realize that the era of arbitrarily invading and easily conquering other countries has passed, thereby delaying the outbreak of the major war they are frantically preparing for. The Korean people have made great contributions to the great cause of defending world peace and security.

    The editorial said: The fighting tasks facing the Korean people, who have achieved a historic victory, are to rapidly restore the war-torn people's economy and strengthen the democratic base of our republic in order to complete the peaceful reunification of the motherland. With the continued assistance of the people of fraternal countries, headed by the great Soviet people, and under the correct leadership of the Workers' Party, our people will surely achieve great victories in the post-war recovery and construction work.

    "Labor News" published an editorial entitled "Our Glorious Motherland," saying: From the first day of its creation, our republic has been following the correct line put forward by the Korean Workers' Party, the guiding and leading force of the Korean people, and the beloved leader Kim Il-sung. Whether in times of peaceful construction or war, the superiority of our people's democratic system and the strong power of our republic have been clearly demonstrated. Today, the entire Korean people proudly shout the name of our lovely and glorious motherland, and under its banner are united and striving for the struggle to restore and develop the post-war people's economy.

    朝鲜“劳动新闻”和“民主朝鲜报”发表社论
    庆祝朝鲜民主主义人民共和国诞生五周年
    【新华社平壤十日电】九月九日是朝鲜民主主义人民共和国诞生五周年纪念日，平壤各报都发表了庆祝社论。
    “民主朝鲜报”社论的题目是：“光荣的祖国——朝鲜民主主义人民共和国万岁！”社论指出：朝鲜人民在伟大苏联军队的援助下，使自己摆脱了日本帝国主义殖民地统治，获得解放，建立起人民政权，实行了各项民主改革，并创建了民主主义人民共和国。这是朝鲜人民唯一最正确的道路。如果没有这样做的话，那么，我们朝鲜人民便不能在反对外来帝国主义和国内反动势力的激烈斗争中成为胜利者。朝鲜人民经过三年祖国解放战争，不仅以英雄的斗争捍卫了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，进一步提高了它的国际威信，而且使当代帝国主义的头目——美帝国主义战争贩子认识到：任意侵犯他国并轻易地征服他国的那种时代已经过去了，从而延迟了他们疯狂准备首的大战的发生。朝鲜人民对于保卫世界和平与安全的伟大事业，作了巨大的贡献。
    社论说：摆在取得了历史性胜利的朝鲜人民面前的战斗任务是：迅速地恢复被战争破坏了的人民经济，加强我们共和国的民主基地，以便完成祖国的和平统一。在以伟大的苏联人民为首的各兄弟国家人民的继续援助下，在劳动党的正确领导下，我们人民在战后恢复和建设的工作中也必能取得巨大的胜利。
      “劳动新闻”发表题为“我们光荣的祖国”的社论说：我们共和国自创建的第一天起，就走着朝鲜人民的指导和领导力量——朝鲜劳动党和敬爱的领袖金日成所提出的正确的路线。无论在和平建设时期或战争时期，都已清楚地显示了我们人民民主制度的优越性和我们共和国的坚强的威力。今天，全朝鲜人民骄傲地高呼着可爱的光荣的祖国的名字，正在它的旗帜下一致奋起，进行着恢复和发展战后人民经济的斗争。
