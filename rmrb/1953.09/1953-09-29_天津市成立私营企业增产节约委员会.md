    Tianjin Establishes Private Enterprise Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee
    Tianjin established the Private Enterprise Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee on September 24th to lead the city's private enterprises in carrying out the increase production and practice economy campaign.
    At the inaugural meeting, Li Gengtao, Deputy Director of the Municipal Finance and Economics Committee, gave important instructions on the policy and practices of private enterprises in carrying out increase production and practice economy. He said: Increase production and practice economy is an important method to promote national economic construction. Private enterprises must develop within the scope of the national plan in order to give play to their positive role in benefiting national construction and people's lives. Therefore, the focus of private industrial increase production and practice economy must be on ensuring the completion of processing and ordering tasks. In completing processing and ordering tasks, it is necessary to ensure quality and quantity, and oppose shoddy work and the use of inferior materials. According to needs and possibilities, production should be carried out in a planned and led manner under the principle of balancing supply, production, and sales. Enterprises with no problems in raw material sales can increase production, but special attention must be paid to improving business management, improving quality, and reducing costs. Enterprises with raw material problems should pay attention to saving raw materials on the principle of improving quality. Some enterprises, due to poor product quality and high prices that affect sales, should work hard to improve quality and reduce costs in order to open up sales channels. He particularly pointed out: At present, the most common problems in private industry are poor product quality, high costs, and poor business management. Therefore, improving quality, reducing costs, and improving business management should become the long-term direction of efforts in the future. Private industry must rely on employees, improve technology, improve management, and oppose repeating the "five poisons" in the increase production and practice economy campaign. At the same time, it is necessary to correctly implement the policy of "both labor and capital benefit, and public and private interests are taken into consideration" to ensure the healthy development of the competition. The content of private commercial increase production and practice economy mainly includes improving business management, saving expenses, reducing commodity circulation costs, opposing speculation and tax evasion, and striving to develop urban-rural exchanges and meet the needs of consumers.
    The inaugural meeting determined that the committee would be chaired by Li Gengtao, Deputy Director of the Municipal Finance and Economics Committee. The vice-chairmen are Li Quanchao (Vice Chairman of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions), Yu Wen (Deputy Minister of the United Front Work Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China), Du Xinbo (Director of the Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce), Bi Mingqi, Zhu Jisheng, and Wang Guangying (all Vice Chairmen of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce).

    天津市成立私营企业增产节约委员会
    天津市于九月二十四日成立了私营企业增产节约委员会，以领导全市私营企业开展增产节约竞赛。
    在成立会上，市财政经济委员会李耕涛副主任对于私营企业开展增产节约的方针和做法，作了重要指示。他说：增产节约是推进国家经济建设的一项重要方法。私营企业必须在国家计划的范围内去发展，才能发挥其对国家建设、对人民生活有利的积极作用，所以私营工业增产节约的重点，必须放在保证完成加工订货任务方面。在完成加工订货任务中，必须保质保量，反对偷工减料；并根据需要和可能，在供、产、销平衡的原则下，有领导有计划地进行生产。如原料销路都没有问题的企业可以增产，但必须特别注意改善经营管理，提高质量，降低成本；原料有问题的企业，应在提高质量的原则下，注意节省原材料；有些由于产品质次价高而影响销路的企业，更应该努力提高质量、降低成本，以打开销路。他特别指出：目前私营工业中最普遍的问题是产品质量次，成本高和经营管理不善，因之，提高质量，降低成本和改善经营管理，应成为今后长期努力的方向。私营工业在增产节约竞赛当中必须要依靠职工、提高技术、改善管理和反对重犯“五毒”；同时，要正确贯彻“劳资两利、公私兼顾”的政策，以保证竞赛的健康发展。私营商业增产节约的内容，主要是改善经营节约开支，减低商品流转费用，反对投机套购和偷税漏税，为开展城乡交流，满足消费者的需要而努力。
    成立会议确定该委员会以市财政经济委员会副主任李耕涛为主任委员。副主任委员为李权超（市总工会副主席）、于文（中共天津市委统一战线部副部长）、杜新波（市工商局局长）、毕鸣岐、朱继圣、王光英（以上市工商联合会副主任委员）。
