How to Prevent Frost

    Tan Ding, Mai Hongzhen, Xu Da

    Editor's Note: Recently, early frost has been discovered in some areas of Northeast China and Inner Mongolia. The North China and Northwest China regions will also enter the frost season. This year, due to summer drought, late sowing, and excessive autumn rain, the autumn harvest period for major autumn crops in these regions has generally been delayed. Therefore, these crops are more likely to suffer from frost damage. This article is specially published for reference in frost prevention.

    What kind of weather can cause frost?

    The occurrence of frost is caused by two reasons: one is that a cold wave moves in from elsewhere, causing the temperature to drop sharply, and the other is that the ground radiates heat outwards and cools down. The former often occurs in large areas, while the latter occurs more sporadically. In fact, the occurrence of frost is often a mixture of these two effects. In the case of a cold wave invasion and a sudden drop in temperature, frost damage caused by the lack of water vapor in the air is called "black frost" by the masses; the frost formed by the encounter of water vapor in the air and a cold wave is called "white frost" by the masses. In addition, a region may also experience frost due to climate change. Different regions experience frost at different times, and even in the same region at the same time, frost conditions may vary. Local meteorological stations issue cold wave warnings for the movement of cold waves. Local observations are needed to assess climate changes in a region.

    What kind of weather is prone to frost? Generally, during the frost season, if the weather is clear during the day, with a slight north wind, and the temperature drops suddenly in the afternoon, or if it rains during the day and clears up at night, there may be frost the next morning. Conversely, if it is cloudy, with a south wind, and the air is humid, the possibility of frost is small. If you use a thermometer to observe the temperature change at any time, you can accurately predict the possibility of frost. The usual method is to hang the thermometer in an open place or a north-facing window and observe the temperature change at regular intervals. If the temperature drops to about 5 degrees Celsius at 9 pm, and continues to drop to 2 or 3 degrees Celsius by midnight, there is a possibility of frost the next morning. If the temperature is still around 5 degrees Celsius after midnight, the possibility of frost the next morning is relatively small.

    Which areas and crops are prone to frost damage?

    According to scientific records and mass experience, hilltops and slopes are not susceptible to frost damage, frost damage is lighter in plains and villages near rivers and woodlands, frost damage is heavier in low-lying areas, and frost damage is most severe in depressions at the foot of slopes. Due to the different cold resistance of various crops and different stages of growth, the degree of frost damage varies. The most damaging autumn early frosts are buckwheat, cotton, rice, tobacco, sweet potatoes, peanuts, tomatoes, and melons; followed by soybeans, sorghum, corn, potatoes, etc.

    Frost prevention methods

    1.  Promote early maturity of crops and reduce the chance of crops being exposed to frost. For example, cotton pruning, pushing plants, and ridging to expose the soil; sorghum appropriately removing bottom leaves (removing three or four) after grain filling; corn cutting off top flowers after grain formation; soybean topping and removing side leaves when stems and leaves are luxuriant can all promote early maturity of crops. In low-lying and wet land, in addition to the above-mentioned pruning, topping, and other work, drainage and weeding should also be done to remove excess moisture from the soil and accelerate crop maturity.

    2.  Smoking method. First, create smoke piles by placing dry grass underneath, then piling semi-wet weeds and fallen leaves on top. If there is a lot of dry grass, cover it with a layer of soil on top. The time to light the smoke pile is before the predicted frost. Because the thick smoke emitted by the smoke pile covers the crops, it promotes the slow dissipation of ground heat, which can protect the crops from frost damage. Smoking should be maintained until one or two hours after sunrise to avoid the crops being exposed to the morning cold air and sudden sunlight. The application of the smoking method to prevent frost requires good organization. In specific implementation, on the one hand, select the crops most vulnerable to severe frost damage and the areas most vulnerable to frost damage; on the other hand, uniformly organize and smoke simultaneously in several areas or several pieces of land within an area to be effective. Smoking should utilize weeds and waste, and frost prevention should be combined with fertilizer accumulation, so that smoking materials can be used for frost prevention when there is frost and for fertilizer accumulation when there is no frost.

    3.  Irrigation method. Irrigation is very effective in preventing frost damage. If there is irrigation equipment, it is best to irrigate once a few days before frost. The shorter the time between irrigation and frost, the better. Irrigation can prevent frost because, on the one hand, the temperature changes more slowly after the soil is wetted by irrigation, and on the other hand, the amount of water vapor in the air increases. When water vapor condenses, it can release latent heat, which can slightly increase the ground temperature and the temperature in the air layer near the ground. Farmers in Suiyuan Province have accumulated experience in using irrigation to prevent frost for many years. However, general crops do not need moisture when they are about to mature. For example, watering cotton easily delays boll opening, and watering millet easily causes greenness. Therefore, when using the irrigation method, it must be determined according to soil moisture, crop type, and growth conditions, and cannot be carried out blindly without distinction.

    4.  Increase crop cold resistance. Generally speaking, improving cultivation techniques can increase crop cold resistance. For example, careful cultivation, rational fertilization, improved soil structure, and appropriate row spacing reduce the chance of frost damage. For some crops, applying more plant ash during the growing season can also enhance frost and freeze resistance. In addition, for crops on small areas of land, covering them with mats or grass can also prevent the dissipation of ground heat,緩slow down ground temperature changes, and reduce frost damage.

    The above methods, if combined under appropriate conditions, can overcome or reduce the disaster of frost. This spring, some wheat-producing areas have gained a lot of experience in preventing spring late frost disasters. All localities should specifically study and propose frost prevention methods suitable for their localities on the basis of summarizing the frost prevention experience of local masses to reduce or avoid frost and strive to harvest more grain and cotton.

    怎样防霜
    谭丁　买鸿镇　徐达
    编者按：最近东北和内蒙部分地区已发现早霜。华北、西北两区也将进入霜期。今年这些地区的大秋作物，因夏季干旱，播种较晚，加以秋雨过多，秋收期一般都推迟。因此，这些作物遭受霜害的可能性增多。现特发表这篇文章，以供各地防霜时的参考。
    什么样的天气可能发生霜冻
    霜冻的发生，一种是因为寒流从别处移来，使温度骤然下降，另一种是因为地面向外散射热量后冷却所造成。前者常在大面积地区出现，后者的发生比较零星。而事实上，霜的出现常是这两种作用混合的结果。在寒流侵入，温度突然下降的情况下，因空气中缺乏水蒸气而发生的霜害，群众称之为“黑霜”；因空中水蒸气和寒流相遇，凝成的霜，群众就称之为“白霜”。另外，一个地区有时因气候的变化也可能结霜。不同的地区，结霜的早晚不同，即使同一地区，同一时间，发生霜冻的情况也可能不同。对寒流的移动，各地气象台都有寒潮警报，一个地区的气候变化，则需要当地自行观测。
    什么样的天气容易发生霜冻呢？一般情形，在霜期内，如果白天天气晴朗，略有北风，下午温度突然下降，或白天有雨，晚上转晴，次日早晨便可能有霜。反之，如果是阴天，有南风，空气湿润时，降霜的可能性便小。如果用温度表随时观察气温的变化，便可以准确地预测有没有结霜的可能。通常的办法是把温度表挂在空旷的地方或向北的窗口，按一定时间观察温度变化。如果晚上九时温度降到摄氏五度左右，到半夜温度降到二、三度还继续下降时，第二天早晨就有结霜可能。如到半夜以后，温度还在五度左右时，第二天早晨结霜的可能性就比较小。
    那些地方和那些作物容易受霜害
    根据科学记载和群众经验，山顶斜坡不易受霜害，平原和靠近河流的村落、林木地带霜害较轻，低地霜害较重，斜坡下的洼地霜害最重。由于各种作物的抗寒能力不同，生长阶段不同，因此，遭受霜害的程度也不同。秋季早霜为害最重的是荞麦、棉花、水稻、烟草、甘薯、落花生、西红柿和瓜类；其次是大豆、高粱、玉米、马铃薯等。
    防霜的办法
    一、促使作物早熟，减少作物受霜的机会。例如棉花整枝、推株、并垅晒地；高粱在定浆以后，适时打掉底叶（打掉三、四个）；玉米结粒以后，剪去顶花；大豆在茎叶繁茂时摘去顶尖，打掉旁叶，都可以促使作物早熟。在土地低湿的地方，除了进行上述整枝、剪去顶花等工作外，还应该做好排水、耘锄，以排去土壤中多余的水分，加速作物的成熟。
    二、熏烟法。首先要造烟堆，把干草放在下边，然后再堆上半湿的杂草、落叶。如果干草多时，上边还得覆盖一层土。点燃烟堆的时间，是在预测将要结霜之前。由于烟堆所发出的浓厚烟雾笼罩在庄稼上面，就促使地面的热缓慢散发，这样，就可以起到保护庄稼免受霜害的作用。熏烟应该保持到太阳升起一、二小时以后，以免作物受早晨的冷气侵袭和日光的突然照射。应用熏烟法防霜，必须有很好的组织。在具体进行中，一方面要选择最易遭受严重霜害的作物和最易遭受霜害的地方；另一方面，又要统一组织，在若干地区或一个地区内的几块地内，同时熏烟，才能生效。熏烟应该利用杂草和废物，同时还应把防霜和积肥结合起来，使熏烟的材料在有霜时防霜，无霜时作积肥用。
    三、灌水法。灌水对于防止霜害极有成效。如有灌水设备，最好在霜前几天灌溉一次。灌水的时间离降霜时间越短越好。灌水所以可以防霜，一方面是因为土壤灌湿以后，温度变化转慢，另一个是因为空气里的水蒸气增多，在水蒸气凝结时可以放出潜热，使地面温度和接近地面气层中的温度有若干增加。绥远省农民，多年运用灌水防霜的办法，已经取得经验。但是一般作物将熟时，是不需要水分的，如棉花浇水容易迟开絮，谷子浇水容易倒青。因此，运用灌水的办法时，必须根据土壤湿度及作物种类，生长情况而定，不能不加区别，盲目进行。
    四、增加作物抗寒能力。一般说，提高栽培技术是可以增加作物的抗寒能力的。如精耕细作，合理施肥，改良土壤结构，株行距离适宜，受霜害的机会就少。有些作物，在生长时期多施一些草木灰，也能增强抗冻和抗霜能力。此外，在小面积土地上的作物，如能用席、草等遮盖，也可阻止地面热量的散发，缓和地温的变化，减轻霜害。
    以上办法，如能在适当条件下结合进行，就可以战胜、或减少霜冻的灾害。今春一些产麦区已对防御春季晚霜的灾害，取得不少经验，各地应在总结当地群众防霜经验的基础上，再具体研究和提出适合当地的防霜办法，以减少或避免霜冻，争取收获更多的粮食和棉花。
