Shiluzi Town Liancun Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Junan County, Shandong Province, summed up its experience and improved the supply of small farm implements. The cooperative has been engaged in the small farm implement business for many years, but due to a lack of investigation and research into the needs of its members, and a lack of experience in the operation of small farm implements, it suffered serious backlogs and losses. In the first half of this year, the cooperative summarized its small farm implement business over the years and found several main lessons in its operation: First, the timing of purchasing small farm implements was not well-grasped, often delaying the farming season due to late purchases. For example, "tiao huo" [carrying poles] are small farm implements used by farmers in the spring to pick up stones, carry manure, and deliver manure. The production area is in the fifth and sixth districts of Junan County, thirty to forty miles away from Shiluzi Town. The "tiao huo" on the Shiluzi market are all sold by vendors, who often raise prices when there is a shortage in the market, causing losses to the masses. Although the cooperative has operated some "tiao huo" over the years at the request of its members, it has been too busy supplying daily necessities before the Spring Festival, and after the Spring Festival, it has not been able to purchase them in time due to the shortage of goods in the production area, resulting in delays in meeting the needs of farmers and also causing backlogs; second, some of the small farm implements supplied did not meet the specifications and quality required by farmers. For example, the masses liked the brooms processed by technicians in Taoluo, Rizhao County, but the brooms processed by the cooperative last year were not up to the specifications required by the masses. Although the price was reduced twice, from before wheat harvest to after wheat harvest, more than 300 brooms were left unsold; third, neglect of storage work reduced the quality. For example, "tiao huo" were always placed in a shed, and after being exposed to wind and sun, they dried out in a few days. This was also a reason for losses and backlogs. The cooperative accepted the above lessons and specifically studied the work of supplying small farm implements during the wheat harvest: First, in order to overcome the problem of untimely supply, it was decided to plan early and order goods early. According to the poor autumn harvest last year due to floods and freezing, and the poor wheat seedlings this year, it was determined that the quantity of small farm implements to be supplied before the summer harvest this year should be less than last year. At the same time, due to the limited purchasing power of the masses, it was also decided to supply more medium-grade goods and fewer high-grade goods. After the plan was determined, people were immediately sent to the production area to order goods separately, and clear provisions were made in the ordering contract for specifications, quality, delivery date, and penalties for delays, to ensure the specifications and quality of the goods. Second, the specifications of the brooms were improved according to the needs of the members. In mid-March, the cooperative sent people to the Taoluo Cooperative in Rizhao County to find technicians to process brooms in the cooperative, and first made a few samples and placed them in the promotion department to solicit the opinions of the members before processing them in large quantities. The members pointed out that the leather straps used to tie the brooms in the past would loosen when wet and easily shed the broomcorn. This year, rattan straps are used instead, which can save 500 yuan in cost per broom and reduce the supply price. When ordering goods from the Qingkou Iron Production Cooperative, it was also requested that the cooperative make a few samples and bring them back to solicit the opinions of the members before placing the order, which could save 1,500 yuan in cost per hoe blade. This not only reduced costs, but also guided the production of the production cooperative. Third, the small farm implements purchased were carefully graded according to quality, and prices were set according to the grades. The advantage of grading and pricing is that the prices are more reasonable, and the masses can freely choose and purchase according to their own economic conditions and uses. This overcomes the tendency of good goods being snapped up and inferior goods being unwanted, resulting in backlogs and losses. Fourth, in terms of transaction methods, the past practice of being afraid of selection was changed, and the goods were displayed for members and farmers to freely choose and purchase. For example, at the farm implement market of the exchange meeting on the sixth day of the fourth lunar month, the cooperative displayed a large number of brooms, wooden rakes, etc., and sold 282 wooden rakes and 594 brooms in one day.
    Because the cooperative attached importance to the supply of small farm implements and carried out a series of reforms in the management method, the supply of small farm implements met the needs of the farmers and smoothly completed the plan. It achieved timely supply, low prices and good quality; the cooperative also maintained reasonable profits and appropriately increased accumulation. (Shandong Provincial Cooperative Headquarters)

    山东莒南县十字路镇联村供销合作社
    总结经验改善农具供应工作
    山东省莒南县十字路镇联村供销社总结经验，改善了小农具的供应工作。该社历年经营小农具业务，因为对社员群众的需要缺乏调查研究，同时对小农具的经营又缺乏经验，造成严重的积压和亏损现象。今年上半年该社就总结了历年的小农具经营工作，找到了经营中的几点主要教训：一、采购小农具的时间没有掌握好，常因采购过晚误了农时。例如条货是开春时农民拾石头，抬粪，送粪用的小农具，产地在莒南县五、六区，离十字路镇有三十到四十里。十字路市场上的条货都是小贩贩卖的，他们往往乘市场缺货时抬价，使群众吃亏。虽在社员的要求下，合作社历年都经营一部分条货，但在春节前因忙于生活资料的供应，春节后又因产地缺货，采购不及时，结果耽误了农民的需要，还造成积压；二、供应的小农具有的规格、质量不合农民需要。例如群众喜欢日照县涛雒技术工人加工的扫帚，可是去年合作社加工的扫帚，因为规格不适合群众的要求，虽经两次减价，从麦收前卖到麦收后，还剩下三百多把；三、忽视保管工作因而降低了质量。例如条货一向是放在一间棚子里，经风吹日晒后，几天工夫就干的走了样。这也是造成亏损和积压的一个原因。该社接受了以上教训，具体研究了麦收时供应小农具的工作：一、为了克服供应不及时的毛病，决定早作计划早订货。根据当地去年大秋因涝、冻歉收和今年小麦苗子不好，确定今年夏收前供应小农具的数量要比去年减少些。同时因群众购买力的限制，还决定多供应中等货，少供应上等货。计划确定以后，就马上派人分头到产地订货，并在订货合同上对规格、质量、交货日期和延期处罚等，都作了明确的规定，保证了货品的规格和质量。二、根据社员需要改进扫帚规格。三月中旬该社就派人到日照县涛雒合作社代找技术工人来社内加工，并先扎了几把样子放在推销部征求社员意见后，才大批加工。社员提出以前扎扫帚用皮条见潮就松，还易掉苗子；今年改用藤条扎，每把可节约成本五百元，降低了供应价格。在向青口铁业生产合作社订货时，也首先叫该社打了几个样品带回来征求社员意见后，才去订货，每张锄刃可以节省成本一千五百元，不仅作到了降低成本，还指导了生产合作社生产。三、把采购来的小农具按照质量仔细分等，按等订价。分等论价的好处是使价格更加合理，群众可以根据自己的经济条件和用途自由选购。克服了好货一抢而空，次货无人要，造成积压和亏损的偏向。四、在交易方式上，改变了过去怕挑选的做法，把商品摆出来让社员和农民自由选购。例如在阴历四月初六日交流会的农具市场上，该社把大批扫帚、木?等陈列起来，一天工夫就卖出了木?二百八十二杆，扫帚五百九十四把。
    由于该社重视了小农具的供应工作，并且在经营管理方法上进行了一系列的改革，使得小农具的供应符合了农民的需要，顺利完成了计划。做到了供应及时，价廉物美；合作社还保持了合理利润，适当的增加了积累。    （山东省合作总社）
