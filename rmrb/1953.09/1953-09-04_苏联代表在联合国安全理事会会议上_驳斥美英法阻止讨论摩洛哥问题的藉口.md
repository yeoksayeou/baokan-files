Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The United Nations Security Council held a meeting on August 26th to discuss the request from fifteen countries, namely Afghanistan, Burma, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Liberia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Thailand, and Yemen. They requested the Security Council to discuss the international conflict arising from France's illegal interference in Morocco and the exile of the legitimate Sultan of Morocco, as well as the threat to world peace and security, and to take measures in accordance with the United Nations Charter.

The first to speak was the French representative, who insisted that the Security Council had no right to discuss the request of the fifteen countries. He also argued that the Moroccan situation fell within France's "domestic jurisdiction."

The Pakistani representative refuted the French representative's argument that the United Nations and the Security Council had no right to discuss the Moroccan situation, pointing out that this was unfounded. He said, "France has virtually turned Morocco into its colony." Instead of negotiating with Morocco to resolve differences, it increased its armed forces stationed in Morocco to suppress the Moroccan people's national liberation movement. He also said that the exile of the Sultan of Morocco once again proved that the French government was ignoring the national demands of the Moroccan people.

Following the Pakistani representative, the Lebanese representative spoke and suggested inviting the fifteen countries that requested an investigation into the Moroccan situation to participate in the Security Council's discussion.

At the United Nations Security Council meeting on August 27th, the US representative, Lodge, insisted that the Moroccan situation did not threaten peace and security, so he opposed including the fifteen countries' request on the Security Council's agenda.

The British representative, Jebb, said that the Security Council had no right to review the dispute in French Morocco, and he used this as a reason to oppose including the fifteen countries' request on the Security Council agenda. The British representative also opposed the Lebanese representative's suggestion.

In response to the British representative's statement, the Pakistani representative said that if Jebb and other Security Council members were truly concerned about studying the Moroccan situation, then they would not oppose including the fifteen countries' request on the agenda, nor would they oppose the Lebanese suggestion.

At the United Nations Security Council meeting on August 31st, the Greek representative spoke, acknowledging that the United Nations had the right to review the Moroccan situation, but he also said that Greece would abstain from voting on including the fifteen countries' request on the Security Council's agenda.

The Soviet representative, Tsarapkin, spoke in support of the fifteen countries' request and supported Lebanon's suggestion to invite representatives from thirteen non-Security Council member countries among the fifteen countries to participate in the Security Council's discussion.

Tsarapkin refuted the reasons put forward by the United States, Britain, and France to prevent the Security Council from discussing the Moroccan question. He pointed out that according to Chapter XI of the United Nations Charter, the United Nations has the right to review the Moroccan situation because France, which is responsible for administering this territory, has violated its obligations. The actions taken by France in Morocco have caused international conflict and threatened international peace and security. The Soviet delegation believes that this issue can and should be included on the Security Council's agenda.

At the meeting on September 1st, the Lebanese and Pakistani representatives criticized the United States, Britain, and France for preventing the Moroccan issue from being included on the Security Council's agenda. The Pakistani representative pointed out that the US representative's refusal to include the Moroccan issue on the Security Council's agenda proves that the United States supports France's colonial rule in Morocco. US Representative Lodge's statement proves that the United States ignores the Moroccan people's struggle for independence. The Pakistani representative praised the Soviet representative's attitude and statement on the Moroccan issue. He emphasized that among the major powers in the Security Council, only the Soviet Union supports the fifteen countries' request and comes out to defend the national interests of Morocco.

    苏联代表在联合国安全理事会会议上
    驳斥美英法阻止讨论摩洛哥问题的藉口
    据新华社讯：联合国安全理事会在八月二十六日举行会议，讨论阿富汗、缅甸、埃及、印度、印尼、伊朗、伊拉克、黎巴嫩、利比里亚、巴基斯坦、菲律宾、沙特阿拉伯、叙利亚、泰国与也门等十五国的要求，它们要求安全理事会讨论由于法国在摩洛哥进行非法干涉并放逐摩洛哥的合法的素勒檀而引起的国际冲突，以及对世界和平与安全的威胁的问题，并根据联合国宪章采取措施。
    第一个发言的是法国代表，他硬说安全理事会无权讨论十五国要求，他还强词夺理说，摩洛哥局势问题属于法国“内务权限之内”。
    巴基斯坦代表驳斥法国代表所谓联合国与安全理事会无权讨论摩洛哥局势的论点，指出这是没有根据的。他说，“法国实际上已经把摩洛哥变成了它的殖民地”，它非但不与摩洛哥进行谈判来解决分歧，反而增加驻在摩洛哥的武装部队，镇压摩洛哥人民的民族解放运动。他还说，放逐摩洛哥素勒檀这件事再一次证明：法国政府对摩洛哥人民的民族要求是置之不理的。
    继巴基斯坦代表以后发言的黎巴嫩代表，建议邀请提出调查摩洛哥局势要求的十五个国家参加安全理事会的讨论。
    在八月二十七日联合国安全理事会会议上，美国代表洛奇硬说，摩洛哥局势不威胁和平与安全，所以他反对把十五国的要求列入安全理事会的议程。
    英国代表杰伯说，安全理事会无权审议法属摩洛哥的争端，他以此为理由反对把十五国的要求列入安理会议程。英国代表并反对黎巴嫩代表的建议。
    巴基斯坦代表回答英国代表的发言时说，如果杰伯及其他安理会理事真正关心研究关于摩洛哥局势问题，那么，他们就不会反对把十五国的要求列入议程，也不会反对黎巴嫩的建议。
    在联合国安全理事会八月三十一日的会议上，希腊代表发言，承认联合国有权审议摩洛哥局势，但是他又说，希腊将在表决把十五国要求列入安理会议程时弃权。
    苏联代表查拉普金发言支持十五国的要求，并支持黎巴嫩提出的邀请十五国中十三个非安理会理事国代表参加安理会讨论的建议。
    查拉普金驳斥了美、英、法三国所提出的阻止安理会讨论摩洛哥问题的理由。他指出，根据联合国宪章第十一章，联合国有权审议摩洛哥局势，因为负责管理这个领土的法国违反了它应负的义务。法国在摩洛哥所采取的行动并已引起国际冲突，威胁到国际和平与安全。苏联代表团认为这个问题能够而且应该列入安理会的议程。
    在九月一日的会议上，黎巴嫩及巴基斯坦代表抨击美国、英国、法国阻止把摩洛哥问题列入安理会议程。巴基斯坦代表指出，美国代表拒绝将摩洛哥问题列入安理会议程，证明美国支持法国在摩洛哥的殖民统治。美国代表洛奇的发言证明美国无视摩洛哥人民争取独立的斗争。巴基斯坦代表赞扬苏联代表在摩洛哥问题上的态度和发言。他强调指出，在安理会各大国中，只有苏联支持十五国的要求，出来保卫摩洛哥的民族利益。
