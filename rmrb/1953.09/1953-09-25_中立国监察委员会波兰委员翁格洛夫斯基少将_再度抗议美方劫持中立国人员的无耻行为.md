Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 24th: Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission Polish Commissioner Major General Ungerowski sent a letter to UN Commander-in-Chief Clark on September 22nd, lodging the most serious protest against the US side’s shameless acts of bribing and kidnapping personnel from the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams. The full text of the protest letter is as follows:

To General Clark, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command:

I have received Major General Byrnes' reply to my letter of September 10, 1953. Regarding this reply, I must state that, contrary to what is stated in his reply, the issues I raised in my letter cannot be considered closed. I regret to state that incidents of personnel under the jurisdiction of the United Nations Command applying pressure and engaging in provocations against Polish personnel of the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams are constantly occurring.

One of these incidents occurred on September 4th, when your side attempted to bribe Ms. Anna Bratkowska, the interpreter for the mobile inspection team on Geoje Island. At that time, US Army Lieutenant Laubard offered her a large sum of US dollars, asking her to agree to flee to the United States and write a story fabricating her so-called experiences.

A similar shameful act of bribery occurred on September 2nd. At that time, another US military officer bribed four members of the aforementioned inspection team. The four members were: Captain Kilarski, Lieutenant Gurikowski, Sergeant Pajak, and Corporal Janczak.

On September 10th, a US military officer bribed a Polish staff member of the Neutral Nations Inspection Team in Busan, offering him US$30,000 to flee to the United States and betray his country.

In all these incidents, the Polish staff of the inspection teams angrily denounced these acts of bribery aimed at humiliating them.

In addition, incidents of violent behavior towards personnel of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission occur frequently. For example, US Army Captain Kalitonov attempted to force the inspection team to remove a segment of testimony about him from the audiotape of an inspection. He cursed and intimidated Stanisław Boreda, the Polish deputy member of the Yeongdeungpo inspection team, using extremely vile language that is not suitable to be repeated here.

On September 9, 1953, a Polish representative was not allowed to see Hadukiewicz, who was later used to conduct hostile propaganda against my country.

These intolerable methods and the atmosphere of hostility being created around the inspection teams are also manifested in the ugly fact that an American soldier beat a member of the inspection team of another nationality until he bled.

The purpose of these methods is to hinder the normal work of the inspection team personnel and to remove some staff through enticements and intimidation, thereby hindering the inspection teams from carrying out their tasks as stipulated in the Armistice Agreement.

These methods should be particularly condemned because they are aimed against representatives of a neutral country who have been invited to Korea with the consent of both sides to carry out their mission of goodwill and to work towards the consolidation of peace.

I lodge the most serious protest against these methods taken by personnel under your jurisdiction, and I consider it my duty to declare that you—the Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command—must bear responsibility for all the consequences that may arise from this behavior.

        Major General Ungerowski
        Polish Commissioner of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission for the Korean Armistice

    中立国监察委员会波兰委员翁格洛夫斯基少将
    再度抗议美方劫持中立国人员的无耻行为
    【新华社开城二十四日电】中立国监察委员会波兰委员翁格洛夫斯基少将于九月二十二日致函联合国军总司令克拉克，再度就美方收买、劫持中立国视察小组人员的无耻行为提出最严重的抗议。抗议信全文如下：联合国军总司令克拉克上将：
    我已接到勃里安少将对我一九五三年九月十日的信的复文，关于这个复文，我必须声明：与他复文里所说的正相反，我信里所提到的各项问题不能认为已经结束。我不胜遗憾地声明：联合国军司令部管辖下的人员对中立国视察小组的波兰工作人员横加压力和进行挑衅的事件正在层出不穷。
    这些事件之一是九月四日发生的你方企图收买在巨济岛上的机动视察小组的译员安纳布拉特科夫斯卡的事件，当时美国陆军中尉劳巴德向她行贿，说要给她一大笔美元，要她同意逃跑到美国去，把她的所谓经历写出来编造一个故事。
    九月二日也发生一件类似的无耻行贿的事件。当时另一个美军军官向上述视察小组的四位组员行贿。那四位组员是：基拉尔斯基上尉、居里柯夫斯基中尉、帕雅克中士和杨察克下士。
    九月十日，一位美国军官向在釜山中立国视察小组里的一位波兰工作人员行贿，说要给他三万美元，要他逃跑到美国，背叛他的祖国。
    在所有这些事件中，视察小组的波兰工作人员都愤怒地痛斥了这种目的在于污辱他们的行贿行为。
    此外，还时常发生对中立国监察委员会人员采取凶暴行为的事件。例如美国陆军上尉卡里托诺夫企图强迫视察小组在关于视察经过的录音片中除去关于他的证言的一段话，他对永登浦视察小组的波兰副组员斯坦尼斯拉夫·伯雷达破口大骂和进行恫吓，他用的言语非常恶劣，不宜于在这里重述。
    一九五三年九月九日，一位波兰代表不被允许去看哈都克耶维赤，哈都克耶维赤后来被利用来对我的国家进行敌意的宣传。
    这种不可容忍的手段和正在各视察小组周围制造的仇视气氛，也表现在这件丑恶的事实上：一个美国士兵把一个视察小组的另一国籍的组员殴打到流血。
    这些手段的目的在于阻挠视察小组人员进行正常工作，并用利诱威逼的手段除去一些工作人员，借以阻挠视察小组执行停战协定所规定他们执行的任务。
    这些手段应该特别受到谴责，因为这些手段的目的在于反对一个中立国家的代表，而这些代表是在双方同意之下被邀来朝鲜执行他们的亲善使命并致力于巩固和平的事业的。
    我对于你管辖下的人员所采取的这些手段提出最严重的抗议，我认为有责任声明：对于这种行为可能引起的一切后果的责任，必须由你——联合国军总司令——担负。
        朝鲜停战中立国监察委员会波兰委员
             翁格洛夫斯基少将
