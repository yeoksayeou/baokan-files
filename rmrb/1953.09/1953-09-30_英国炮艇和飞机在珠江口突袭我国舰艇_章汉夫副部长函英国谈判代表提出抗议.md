Xinhua News Agency, 29th: On September 9th, a British gunboat and two "Mosquito" fighter-bombers carried out provocative and surprise attack actions against Chinese naval vessels in the waters between Neilingding Island southwest and Hengzhou in the Pearl River Estuary. They retreated only after we returned fire.

On September 12th, the British government's negotiation representative, Humphrey Trevelyan, instead sent a letter to Vice Minister Zhang Hanfu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government, protesting and attempting to cover up the fact that British boats and aircraft provoked and attacked us on that day.

Vice Minister Zhang Hanfu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government delivered a letter to Humphrey Trevelyan, the British government's negotiation representative, on September 29th, in reply to his letter of September 12th. The full text of the reply is as follows:

Mr. Humphrey Trevelyan, Representative:

Your letter No. 213 of September 12, 1953, has been received. I am instructed to reply as follows, please forward to the British Government.

According to confirmed reports obtained by the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, at 14:04 (local time) on September 9th, as naval patrol vessels of the People's Republic of China were sailing in the waters between Neilingding Island southwest and Hengzhou in the Pearl River Estuary, they discovered an armed gunboat, not displaying any national flag, sailing towards them. They immediately issued an inquiry using international signals. The suspicious gunboat, whose intentions were unclear, did not respond and continued to speed towards them. In view of the fact that pirate ships and boats had frequently disturbed the waters for a long time, the naval patrol vessels of the People's Republic of China fired three shots into the air to warn the boat to stop. The approaching boat not only ignored the warning but rushed towards our vessels even more aggressively. The naval vessels of the People's Republic of China fired two more shots into the air as a warning. At this time, the suspicious boat suddenly attacked the vessels of the People's Republic of China, firing more than ten shots; therefore, the vessels of the People's Republic of China returned fire in self-defense. As a result, the attacking gunboat fled towards the South Sea.

Based on the above facts and the content of your letter, it can now be determined that the gunboat that did not display any national flag, ignored international signals, disregarded repeated warnings, and provoked and launched a surprise attack on the vessels of the People's Republic of China was a British naval gunboat.

Furthermore, according to confirmed reports, between 14:18 and 15:05 on September 9th, two "Mosquito" fighter-bombers, identifiable as belonging to the British government, successively dived and strafed the vessels of the People's Republic of China in the Pearl River Estuary and intruded into the airspace over Neilingding Island, attempting to provoke a conflict. They flew towards Hong Kong only after being resisted by the air defense forces on the island.

Since the facts are as such, the Central People's Government considers the protest lodged by the British Government unacceptable. The Central People's Government lodges a strong protest with the British Government against the aforementioned provocative and surprise attack actions by British naval gunboats and British "Mosquito" fighter-bombers, and hopes that the British Government will immediately take necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of such incidents.

Please accept the expression of my highest consideration.

Zhang Hanfu
Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China
September 29, 1953, in Beijing

    英国炮艇和飞机在珠江口突袭我国舰艇
    章汉夫副部长函英国谈判代表提出抗议
    【新华社二十九日讯】九月九日，英国炮艇一艘及“蚊式”战斗轰炸机两架，在我国珠江口内内伶仃岛西南及横洲之间的海面上，对我国海军舰艇进行了挑衅和突袭行动，经我还击后始行退去。
    九月十二日，英国政府谈判代表杜维廉反而致函我中央人民政府外交部章汉夫副部长抗议，企图掩饰英艇及英机当日向我挑衅和突袭的事实。
    我中央人民政府外交部章汉夫副部长于九月二十九日送交英国政府谈判代表杜维廉公函一件，对其九月十二日来函予以答复。复文全文如下：杜维廉代表先生：
    一九五三年九月十二日第二一三号来文业经收悉。兹奉命作如下答复，请转知英国政府。
    根据中华人民共和国中央人民政府所得已经证实了的报告，九月九日十四时四分（当地时间），中华人民共和国海军巡逻用舰艇在珠江口内内伶仃岛西南及横洲间的海面上驶行之际，发现有未悬任何国旗的武装炮艇一艘向其驶来，当即以国际信号发出询问。该形迹可疑来意不明的炮艇并不置答，仍加速急驶前来。中华人民共和国海军巡逻舰艇鉴于该处海面上多时以来常有海盗船艇扰乱活动，乃向空发炮三发，警告该艇停车。该来艇不但不予理会，反而更加向我舰艇急冲挑衅，中华人民共和国舰艇再度向空发炮二发，予以警告。此时该形迹可疑的来艇突然向中华人民共和国舰艇进攻，发炮十余发；因此，中华人民共和国舰艇为了自卫乃予以还击。结果该进犯的炮艇始向南面大海逃去。
    根据以上事实及来文所述，现可判明：该未悬任何国旗并对国际信号不予理会、无视一再警告、向中华人民共和国舰艇挑衅并进行突袭的炮艇，即系英国海军的炮艇。
    又据确报，九月九日十四时十八分至十五时五分之间，有可辨认确属于英国政府的“蚊式”战斗轰炸机二架先后向在珠江口内的中华人民共和国舰艇俯冲扫射，并侵入内伶仃岛上空，企图寻衅，经该岛上防空部队抗击后，始行向香港方面飞去。
    事实经过既系如此，中央人民政府对于英国政府所提抗议认为不能接受。中央人民政府对英国海军炮艇及英国“蚊式”战斗轰炸机的上述挑衅和突袭的行动，向英国政府提出强烈抗议；并希望英国政府立即采取必要的措施，防止此类事件之再度发生。
    顺向阁下表示最崇高之敬意。
    中华人民共和国
    中央人民政府外交部副部长
    章汉夫
    一九五三年九月二十九日于北京
