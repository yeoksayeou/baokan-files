How We Reversed the Situation of Failing to Complete the Tunneling Plan
Zhang Yueting, Deputy Director of the Beipiao Mining Bureau

Editor's Note: Transforming the backward state of tunneling work is a central link in improving coal mine production. The Beipiao Mining Bureau has been commended by the Central Fuel Industry Department for effectively strengthening tunneling work, thus overfulfilling its production tasks every month. The experience of the Beipiao Mining Bureau is worth learning and promoting in coal mines across the country.

Tunneling work is one of the important processes in coal mine production. It continuously prepares sites for coal mining and creates preconditions for expanded reproduction. To enable the rapid development of coal mine production, completing the tunneling plan on time is an extremely important task. The Beipiao Mining Bureau had a painful lesson: in 1951, workers in factories and mines throughout Northeast China launched a vigorous campaign to increase production and practice economy, overfulfilling their production plans, but the Beipiao Mining Bureau did not even complete the state plan. The main reason was that the tunneling work was not done well, and there was a lack of coal mining sites for preparation. Therefore, once the coal mining site changed (such as the coal seam becoming thinner, encountering faults, increased gas, roof fall), and there were no other coal mining sites, all they could do was worry anxiously, without any solutions.

Learning from this lesson, we attached importance to tunneling work in 1952. We established a tunneling section within the bureau's mining department to specifically guide tunneling work; each mine also designated a tunneling person in charge. With the supervision of the Party branch, the vigorous cooperation of the Youth League and the trade union, and other measures, the tunneling work took on a new look. In 1952, our bureau completed 148.5 percent of the tunneling plan, ensuring the smooth progress of production, and completing 132.3 percent of the state production plan for the year. In the first quarter of this year, the tunneling work was relaxed for a time. After April, the tunneling work improved again, completing the plan for the month and basically making up for the figures owed in the previous months. Now the entire bureau has enough coal mining sites for ten months of mining. In coal mining, the task is overfulfilled every month as well. From January 1st to August 20th, in addition to completing the cumulative plan, it exceeded by 1.4 percent. From the above facts, the cadres of the Beipiao Mining Bureau deeply realize that in order to complete the coal production task, tunneling work must be done well.

We mainly did the following tasks in strengthening the tunneling work. These are also our main experiences:

1.  Restoring and improving the system of special personnel responsible for tunneling is the main factor in reversing the failure to complete the tunneling plan. In March of this year, we improved and redeployed the tunneling personnel responsible for each pit entrance, and at the same time announced the responsibilities and powers of the tunneling负责人responsible for each pit. In April, following the resolution of the safe production meeting, the tunneling专责personnel in charge of certain pit entrances who were not competent for the work were replaced (now all are held by pit leaders or strong deputy pit leaders), and a deputy mine director was designated to be specifically responsible for tunneling. After taking these measures, the phenomenon of no one being responsible for the tunneling work was eliminated, ensuring the stabilization of tunneling workers and equipment, thus powerfully guaranteeing the successful completion of the tunneling task.

2.  Strengthening plan management, implementing cyclic operation, and vigorously developing rapid tunneling teams. Based on the original state plan and with reference to the actual situation, we formulated quarterly plans and monthly construction plans for the bureau, mines, and pits, and implemented plan management in each major roadway tunneling site through monthly operation plans and work cycle charts. At the same time, starting in April, we vigorously selected ordinary tunneling teams to help them become rapid tunneling teams. In order to maintain a fast and balanced speed between the rapid tunneling teams and the ordinary tunneling teams, we also focused on promoting cyclic operation in the rapid tunneling teams. As of now, we have implemented work cycle charts in eighteen tunneling teams. After implementing the cycle chart, Ji Xiangguo's team has consistently exceeded the rapid standard every month; before implementing the cycle chart, Li Qinghai's team and the First Youth Team of Taiji No. 1 Pit could only advance 6.5 meters per day when tunneling in the coal seam. As a result of the work cycle chart reasonably organizing the members of their groups and closely connecting the various types of work processes, they can now regularly maintain a record of 9 meters per day (reaching a maximum of 10 meters).

3.  Holding tunneling professional meetings, discovering and solving key problems in a timely manner. In early May, the tunneling construction plan had not been completed, so we specially convened tunneling professional meetings of tunneling专责personnel at all levels of the bureau, mines, and pits and relevant departments to study the main reasons for the failure to complete the tunneling task and the methods for correcting shortcomings, and to criticize and educate units and individuals who were not effective in leading the tunneling work. Therefore, starting from the middle of the month, the trend of failing to complete the tunneling according to the construction plan began to reverse, and the tunneling plan was overfulfilled by 135 percent in May.

4.  Launching labor emulation campaigns. In order to ensure the smooth completion of the state plan, the Beipiao Mining Bureau started a labor emulation campaign on April 1st and placed the completion of the tunneling plan in the primary position of the competition, making all employees pay attention to the tunneling work and encouraging the enthusiasm of the tunneling workers, thus greatly promoting the tunneling work.

5.  Seriously promoting advanced experience. In addition to promoting advanced experience such as cyclic operation and rapid tunneling teams, we also promoted the following advanced experiences: adopting finished sheds and finished wedges in tunneling sites to ensure the specification quality of roadways and improve tunneling efficiency; promoting roof support sheds to ensure safe tunneling; promoting hollow blasting method; creating and promoting iron props to avoid the collapse of sheds and facilitate tunneling work. According to estimates, this one experience alone can enable the entire bureau to tunnel an additional 400 to 500 meters per year.

6.  The Party committee, trade union, Youth League and other organizations acted in unison and vigorously cooperated, ensuring the overfulfillment of the tunneling task.

Through the above-mentioned measures, we have begun to change the backward state of tunneling work. However, there are still many shortcomings, such as insufficient leadership and assistance to rapid tunneling teams. Therefore, in promoting this advanced experience, although there are many in number, some are of poor quality; the implementation of cycle chart operation is not widespread enough. Therefore, consolidating existing achievements and experience, further adopting more effective methods to overcome the above-mentioned shortcomings, and improving future work to ensure the overfulfillment of the annual tunneling plan is the main direction of our bureau's efforts in the future.

    我们怎样扭转了完不成掘进计划的局面
    北票矿务局副局长　张月亭
    编者按：转变掘进工作的落后状况，是目前提高煤矿生产的中心环节。北票矿务局由于切实加强了掘进工作，因而生产月月超额完成任务，得到了中央燃料工业部的表扬。北票矿务局的经验值得各地煤矿学习推行。
    矿坑的掘进工作是煤矿生产过程中的重要工序之一，它不间断地为采煤准备场所，给扩大再生产创造前提。要使煤矿的生产获得迅速发展，按时完成掘进计划是一项极重要的工作。北票矿务局曾有过痛苦的教训：一九五一年全东北各厂矿职工轰轰烈烈地开展了增产节约运动，超额完成了生产计划，而北票矿务局却连国家计划都未完成。主要原因就是掘进工作作得不好，缺乏作预备用的采煤场所，因之采煤场所一旦发生变化（如煤层变薄、遇见断层、瓦斯增大、冒顶），而又没有其他采煤场所，眼看着完不成任务，也只有干着急，没有一点办法。
    接受这次教训，我们在一九五二年就重视掘进工作了，在局的矿务科内成立了掘进股，专门指导掘进工作；各矿坑也指定了掘进负责人，加上党支部的监督，青年团和工会的大力配合及其他各种措施，使掘进工作出现了新面貌。一九五二年我局完成掘进计划百分之一百四十八点五，保证了生产的顺利进行，全年完成国家生产计划百分之一百三十二点三。今年的第一季掘进工作曾一度放松，四月份以后，掘进工作又有了新的好转，完成了当月计划，并把前几个月欠下的数字也基本上补足了。现在全局的采煤场所足够十个月的开采。在采煤方面，也月月超额完成任务，一月一日至八月二十日止，除完成累计计划外，并超过了百分之一点四。北票矿务局的干部们从以上事实中，深深认识到要想完成煤的生产任务，必须做好掘进工作。
    我们在加强掘进工作中主要是做了以下几项工作，这也是我们的几点主要经验：
    一、恢复与健全掘进专人负责制，这是扭转掘进不能完成计划的主要因素。我们于今年三月健全与重新调配了各坑口的掘进专责人员，同时公布了各坑掘进负责人的责任与职权，四月份又遵循安全生产会议的决议，将某些不能胜任工作的坑口掘进专责人予以调换（现都由坑长或强有力的副坑长担任），并指定一位副矿长专负掘进责任。经采取这些措施以后，消灭了掘进工作无人负责的现象，保证了掘进工人与工具设备的固定化，因而有力地保证了掘进任务的胜利完成。
    二、加强计划管理，贯彻循环作业，大力发展快速掘进队。我们以国家原计划为依据，参照实际情况，制订了局、矿、坑的季度计划和月的施工计划，并通过月作业计划与工作循环图表，在各个主要大巷掘进场子中实现计划管理。同时，从四月份开始，大力选拔普通掘进队帮助他们成为快速掘进队。为了使快速掘进队与普通掘进队保持快而均衡的速度，我们还在快速掘进队中重点地推行了循环作业，截至目前止，我们已经在十八个掘进队中贯彻了工作循环图表。季祥国队在贯彻了循环图表之后，一直按月超过了快速标准；李青海队和台吉一坑第一青年队在贯彻循环图表以前，在煤层中掘进只能日进六点五公尺，由于工作循环图表把他们小组的成员合理的组织起来，把各个工种工序紧密衔接起来的结果，现在已可经常保持日进九公尺的纪录（最高达到十公尺）。
    三、召开掘进专业会议，及时发现和解决关键问题。在五月初，掘进施工计划一直没有完成，便专门召集了局、矿、坑各级掘进专责人员及有关部门开掘进专业会议，研究了完不成掘进任务的主要原因和改正缺点的办法，并对领导掘进工作不力的单位及个人进行了批评与教育，因而由中旬起便开始扭转了掘进不能按施工计划完成的趋势，五月份超额完成掘进计划百分之一百三十五。
    四、开展劳动竞赛。为了保证国家计划能够顺利完成，北票矿务局从四月一日开始劳动竞赛，并把完成掘进计划放在竞赛的首要地位，使全体职工重视了掘进工作，鼓舞了掘进工人的热情，因而也大大推动了掘进工作。
    五、认真推广先进经验。除推广了循环作业和快速掘进队等先进经验外，并推广了以下几种先进经验：在掘进场子中采用成品棚子和成品楔子，以保证大巷的规格质量和提高掘进效率。推广了护顶棚子，以保证安全掘进。推广了空心爆破法。创造和推广了铁撑子，避免了棚子崩倒的事件，便利了掘进工作，据推算，仅此一项经验，可使全局全年多掘进四百公尺至五百公尺。
    六、党委、工会、青年团等组织步调一致和大力配合，保证了掘进任务的超额完成。
    经过了上述的种种措施，我们开始改变了掘进工作的落后状况。但也还存在着许多缺点，如对快速掘进队的领导与帮助还不够，因此在推广这一先进经验上表现出数量虽多，但有的质量尚差；在贯彻循环图表作业方面，还不够普遍。因此，巩固既有的成绩与经验，进一步采取更多的有效办法克服上述缺点，改进今后工作，保证全年掘进计划的超额完成，是我局今后努力的主要方向。
