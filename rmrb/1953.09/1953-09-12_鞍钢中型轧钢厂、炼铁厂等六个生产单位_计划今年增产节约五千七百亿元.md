    Anshan Iron and Steel's Medium-Sized Rolling Mill, Ironmaking Plant, and Six Other Production Units
    Plan to Increase Production and Save 570 Billion Yuan This Year
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The medium-sized rolling mill, ironmaking plant, steelmaking plant, small rolling mill, chemical plant, and metal products plant of the state-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company have formulated plans to accumulate huge wealth for the country through increased production and conservation. The workers and staff of each unit have focused on the key links in production and launched a labor emulation drive.
    The medium-sized rolling mill has set a target of increasing production (total product value) and saving over 200 billion yuan for the whole year. This is the plant under Anshan Iron and Steel Company that will generate the most value for the country through increased production and savings. The main method for the medium-sized rolling mill to increase production and conserve resources is to vigorously promote advanced experiences while continuing to implement the operation plan. In the past, each unit of the plant had many advanced experiences. For example, when rolling round steel, the output per hour of rolling team B was higher than any other team; team A was most confident in rolling square steel, and the output was always higher than teams B and C; while when rolling light rails, the output of team C was higher than other teams. Now, the advanced experiences of these teams have been summarized and are being prepared for widespread promotion among rolling workers. The second is to strengthen labor organization, shorten the time for changing rolls, adjusting, and pressure testing, so as to improve the operating rate. The third is to further strengthen the repair and maintenance of mechanical equipment to ensure that no accidents occur during production and to achieve safe production. The enthusiasm of all workers, engineers, and technicians in the plant for increasing production and saving resources is very high. Many employees get together to study how to increase production. Many teams and groups challenge each other, unanimously guaranteeing to complete the national plan and the production increase and conservation plan, and to supply the medium-sized steel needed for industrial production and basic construction across the country in a timely manner.
    The ironmaking plant has set a plan to increase production (total production value) and save 160 billion yuan. The administrative side and the CCP Party Committee, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations of the plant are fully mobilizing workers to carry out a labor emulation drive, and have determined that the central content of this competition is to further strengthen plan management and implementation of operation plans, promote advanced experiences, carry out mass rationalization proposals, and strengthen mechanical maintenance. After inspecting the implementation of the plan in the first half of the year, workers in each workshop and group are further discussing specific ways to complete the task of increasing production and conserving resources, and some units have established a system of weekly inspections and monthly summaries. In order to more widely carry out rationalization proposals and promote advanced experiences, the plant's trade union organization has successively held forums for labor models and advanced producers, calling on all employees to actively put forward suggestions for transforming old equipment. The workers have also put forward eight proposals to change operations such as hanging cans and loading iron blocks to mechanized automation, and related equipment is being tested and manufactured, striving to complete all installations within this month. At the same time, the plant has summarized seven advanced experiences, such as the quick air vent replacement of the No. 4 blast furnace and the quick repair method of the repair shop, and is preparing to vigorously promote them in other units.
    The steelmaking plant has formulated a plan to increase production and save 90 billion yuan for the whole year. In terms of increasing production, the steelmaking plant plans to mainly promote advanced experiences such as "fast furnace repair," "layered burnout and fast charging," and "high temperature, thin slag, boiling operation method" to ensure steel tapping according to steel grades and implement rapid steelmaking. At the same time, it is also necessary to strengthen mechanical maintenance and maintenance, further promote the advanced experience of "pre-assembly" rapid maintenance and diligent oiling and inspection, so as to reduce maintenance time and equipment accidents, and increase steelmaking operation time. In terms of conservation, the steelmaking plant plans to reduce the consumption of raw materials such as scrap steel and molten iron by recycling unused steel slag and returning it to the furnace for steelmaking, and to ensure all fixed-material steelmaking. And use waste materials to manufacture maintenance spare parts to reduce workshop expenses. In addition, the steelmaking plant also plans to vigorously promote the mechanization and automation movement. The plant's leadership has put forward ten mechanization and automation topics, and is mobilizing all employees to jointly study and solve them.
    The small rolling mill has set a plan to increase production and save 60 billion yuan. Before formulating the plan to increase production and save resources, the small rolling mill first studied the plant's production situation in detail, and clearly realized that the improvement in the production situation in June, July, and August was mainly due to mobilizing workers to discuss the national plan and strengthening plan management, improving the balance rate of production, and increasing pure operation time. For example, before May, the production balance rate was 83.3 percent, and the pure operation time was 76.9 percent; after July, the balance rate was 95 percent, and the pure operation time was 80 percent. The plant's employees seized the key links in production, and then carried out careful calculations, so as to formulate a plan to increase production and save 60 billion yuan. In order to effectively complete this plan, the plant's Party committee held another meeting to study it, and found that the specific key to completing the plan was: rapidly completing several new creations of automation, shortening the time for repairing heating furnaces, improving the product quality of the second workshop, and shortening the installation of safety gas pipelines. Now, the plant is mobilizing workers to discuss the plan to increase production and conserve resources, and to formulate the plans of each workshop and group.
    The chemical plant has formulated a plan to increase production and save 21.1 billion yuan. Before formulating the plan, the plant also first inspected the implementation of the national plan in the first half of the year, and then determined the specific direction for increasing production and conserving resources in the future: from September to December, to produce more than 26,600 tons of large coke than the national plan, strictly control the cost plan, improve equipment utilization, and save water and electricity consumption. In order to achieve the plan to increase production and conserve resources, the plant's trade union convened a factory-wide rationalization proposal committee. After research, it put forward fifty-three key issues to each workshop, calling on employees to actively find tricks and put forward rationalization proposals to work hard to solve them. Trade union cadres also focused on going deep into the coal washing workshop to provide specific assistance. Now, each group in the workshop has put forward specific measures and formulated a group production increase and conservation plan. For example, the coal washing section decided to add a pipe to the No. 1 tipper to recover the crushed coal fines for re-washing, and install a vibrating plug on the discharge machine to recover 64 percent of the good coal contained in the coal slime, so that the recovery rate can be increased by 3 percent. The technical personnel of the workshop also cooperated with the workers to formulate plans, and carried out mechanical appraisal to determine the degree of use and repair period of each machine, so as to strengthen equipment maintenance. Now the plant's trade union is promoting the experience of the coal washing workshop to the whole plant.
    After inspecting the production situation in the first half of the year, the metal products plant also formulated a plan to increase production and save 40 billion yuan.

    鞍钢中型轧钢厂、炼铁厂等六个生产单位
    计划今年增产节约五千七百亿元
    【本报讯】国营鞍山钢铁公司中型轧钢厂、炼铁厂、炼钢厂、小型轧钢厂、化工总厂和金属制品厂等生产单位，订出了为国家积累巨额财富的增产节约计划。各单位的职工抓住生产中的主要环节，展开了劳动竞赛。
    中型轧钢厂订出了全年增产（产品总值）和节约两千多亿元的计划。这是鞍山钢铁公司所属厂矿中为国家增产节约价值最多的一个厂。中型轧钢厂增产节约的主要办法，是在继续贯彻作业计划的基础上，大力推广先进经验。过去该厂各个单位都有许多先进经验，如压延乙班轧圆钢时，每小时的产量比任何一班都高；甲班轧方钢最有把握，产量总比乙班、丙班要高；而轧轻轨时，丙班的产量又比其他班高。现在，这几个班的先进经验已经总结起来，准备在压延工人中普遍推广。其次是加强劳动组织工作，缩短换轧辊和调整、试压等时间，以提高作业率。第三是进一步加强机械设备检修与维护工作，保证在生产中不发生事故，做到安全生产。该厂全体工人、工程技术人员增产节约的情绪十分高涨。许多职工凑到一起，就研究怎样增产的问题。许多班、组相互挑战应战，一致保证完成国家计划和增产节约计划，及时供给全国各地工业生产和基本建设所需要的中型钢材。
    炼铁厂订出了增产（生产总值）和节约一千六百亿元的计划。该厂行政方面和中共党委、工会、青年团等组织，正在全力发动职工开展劳动竞赛，并确定这次竞赛的中心内容，是进一步加强计划管理和贯彻作业计划，推广先进经验，开展群众性的合理化建议和加强机械维护工作。各个车间、小组的职工在检查了上半年执行计划的情况以后，正在进一步讨论完成增产节约任务的具体办法，有些单位已经制订出按周检查、按月总结的制度。为了更广泛地开展合理化建议和推广先进经验，该厂工会组织曾先后召开了劳动模范和先进生产者座谈会，号召全体职工踊跃提出改造旧设备的建议。职工们并已提出了把挂罐、装铁块等操作改为机械化自动化的八项建议，有关的设备正在试验制造，争取在本月内全部装置成功。同时，该厂已总结出四号炼铁炉的快速换风口和修理厂的快速修理法等七项先进经验，准备在其他单位大力推广。
    炼钢厂已制订出全年增产节约九百亿元的计划。在增加生产方面，炼钢厂计划主要通过推广“快速补炉”、“分层烧透、快速装料”和“高温、薄渣，沸腾操作法”等先进经验，保证按钢种出钢，实行快速炼钢。同时，还要加强机械检修和维护工作，进一步推行“预装配”的快速检修法和勤浇油、勤检查等机械维护的先进经验，以减少检修时间和设备事故，增加炼钢的作业时间。在节约方面，炼钢厂计划通过回收过去不用的钢渣再回炉炼钢，以便降低废钢、铁水等原料的消耗量，保证全部定料炼钢。并利用废料制造检修备品，以缩减车间经费。此外，炼钢厂还计划大力推进机械化自动化运动，该厂的领导方面已提出十个机械化自动化课题，正在发动全厂职工共同研究解决。
    小型轧钢厂订出了增产节约六百亿元的计划。小型轧钢厂在订增产节约计划之前，首先详细研究了全厂的生产情况，明确认识到六、七、八月份生产情况的好转，主要是由于发动工人讨论了国家计划并加强了计划管理，提高了生产的均衡率和增加了纯作业时间。例如在五月份以前，生产均衡率是百分之八十三点三，纯作业时间是百分之七十六点九；七月份以后，均衡率是百分之九十五，纯作业时间是百分之八十。该厂职工抓住了生产中的主要环节，接着进行了精打细算，从而订出了增产节约六百亿元的计划。为了切实完成这个计划，该厂党委再次召开会议进行研究，找出了完成计划的具体关键是：迅速完成几件自动化的新创造、缩短整修加热炉的时间、改进二车间的产品质量、缩短安装安全瓦斯管道等。现在，该厂正发动工人讨论增产节约计划和制订各车间各小组的计划。
    化工总厂订出了增产节约二百一十一亿元的计划。在订计划之前，该厂也首先检查了上半年执行国家计划的情况，然后确定了今后增产节约的具体方向是：从九月到十二月，比国家计划多生产两万六千六百多吨大块焦，严格掌握成本计划，提高设备运用率和节省水电消耗等。为了实现增产节约的计划，该厂工会召开了全厂合理化建议委员会，经过研究后，向各车间提出了五十三个关键问题，号召职工积极找窍门、提合理化建议来努力解决。工会干部并重点深入洗煤车间进行具体帮助。现在，该车间各小组都提出了具体措施，制订了小组增产节约计划。如：洗煤工段确定在一号翻斗机上加管子，把碎煤末收回重洗，并在排涤机上安设震动塞，以收回煤泥中含着的百分之六十四的好煤等，这样就可以把回收率提高百分之三。该车间的技术人员也配合工人订计划，并做好机械鉴定，确定每件机械的使用程度、检修期限，以加强设备维护工作。现在该厂工会正将洗煤车间的经验向全厂推广。
    金属制品厂在检查上半年的生产情况以后，也订出了增产节约四百亿元的计划。
