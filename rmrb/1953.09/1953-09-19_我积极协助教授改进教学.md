    I Actively Assist Professors in Improving Teaching
    Chen Fen, Teaching Assistant of Paleobotany, Beijing Geological College
    I am a teaching assistant in paleobotany at Beijing Geological College. Professor Pan Zhongxiang, a petroleum geology expert, is the main lecturer for paleobotany. Initially, Professor Pan Zhongxiang, seeing the extensive content of the Soviet teaching syllabus, lacked confidence in his teaching. During his first two classes, he only covered one or two pages of lecture notes, writing a lot on the blackboard but explaining little. Students raised many concerns: "Just reading without explaining is no better than giving us the lecture notes to read ourselves." After careful study and research, he wrote a teaching syllabus based on the Soviet syllabus and used wall charts for his lectures. The students were satisfied, and the exam results were very good. Some students reflected: "Mr. Pan's lectures have improved greatly recently, with a focus on key points." Students who didn't do well on the exam also made self-criticisms: "I understood what the teacher taught, but I didn't do well on the exam because I didn't review. I will work harder in the future."
    Professor Pan Zhongxiang's significant improvement in teaching is mainly due to his own efforts, but everyone's help also played a significant role.
    When I was a student, I always felt that Professor Pan Zhongxiang taught a set of British and American methods, lacking practical experience and having poor teaching methods, simply reciting the lecture notes in a straightforward manner. After I became a teaching assistant, I only complained to him: "Why haven't you improved much after teaching for so many years?" The students didn't gain much, and it was difficult for me to improve as well. When students had opinions, I simply passed them on to him without any changes. This approach not only didn't help him but also affected his mood.
    Later, under the leadership of the Party, we teachers (Youth League members) studied Comrade Chen Boda's report at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Comrade Chen Boda said: "Communist Party members should cooperate with scientists, learn from them, and help them solve difficulties in their work." Based on this spirit, we conducted self-examinations. I discovered significant shortcomings in my thinking. In the past, I focused more on Professor Pan Zhongxiang's shortcomings and paid little attention to his strengths. For example, I always thought that he lacked knowledge of modern petroleum exploration, while neglecting his rich knowledge in identifying fossils and other areas. Through studying, I realized that today our country needs to mobilize all available forces to participate in the great construction, especially experienced geological talents. Professor Pan Zhongxiang's rich knowledge of paleobotany is of great use to coalfield geology and petroleum geology majors. I must help him overcome certain shortcomings in his work and actively assist him in doing a good job in teaching.
    Therefore, I always kept Comrade Chen Boda's words in mind, determined to help Professor Pan Zhongxiang teach the class well.
    After I clearly understood the Party's policy towards intellectuals ideologically, I studied the reasons why Professor Pan Zhongxiang wasn't teaching well. To help him overcome the shortcoming of only reading without explaining, I drew fossil diagrams on the lecture notes and eventually turned them into wall charts. This way, he could easily point to the diagrams and give lively explanations to the students. I also introduced him to the lesson preparation experiences of other teachers, so that he could repeatedly think before lecturing, making his lectures clear and concise, with both repetition and key points. I also planned to spend time copying lecture notes and rushing to make wall charts for him. Once, before a class, his lecture notes were still not fully prepared, so I proactively offered to guarantee, "If you can prepare it, I guarantee to copy it and print it out." Finally, we managed to prepare and print out the lecture notes.
    We not only changed our past passive attitude of simply criticizing and complaining and actively assisted Professor Pan Zhongxiang in improving teaching, but I also respected his progress. I often rejoiced in his progress. When I heard that students were satisfied with the improvements in teaching, I immediately told him, and at the same time, I told the students about his active lesson preparation. As a result, Professor Pan Zhongxiang gained confidence in his lectures and actively delved into his profession.
    Professor Pan Zhongxiang also cares about our work. When I am busy, he helps me identify fossils for practice and revises my practice lecture notes. Now, I feel that working with him, as long as I am humble, I can learn a lot of valuable knowledge. Professor Pan Zhongxiang's serious and conscientious attitude towards science is worth learning.
    When Professor Pan Zhongxiang had shortcomings in his work, I was able to offer suggestions and criticisms. For example, once he was going to lecture on a type of spore plant, and its spores and seeds were very similar. He should have compared the two in his lecture, but he didn't prepare any seeds and asked me to only draw spores. I felt that this was an irresponsible attitude and voiced my criticism. In the end, he accepted my opinion and immediately turned to books and dictionaries that night until he understood the problem clearly before resting.
    I am able to assist Professor Pan Zhongxiang in improving teaching mainly because of the education provided by the Party and the Youth League, which enabled me to understand the Party's policy of uniting and transforming intellectuals and changed my incorrect attitude towards professors. There is still much work to be done in the future, such as streamlining the curriculum, improving teaching quality, assisting students in complying with the work and rest schedule, and strengthening connections with students. I think that as long as I work hard, I will definitely be able to better complete my teaching tasks.

### 我积极协助教授改进教学

    我积极协助教授改进教学
    北京地质学院古植物学助教  陈芬
    我是北京地质学院古植物学的助教。主讲古植物学的是石油地质专家潘钟祥教授。起初，潘钟祥教授看到苏联教学大纲内容很多，对教学缺乏信心。他上最初两堂课时只讲一两张讲义，写黑板多，讲解少。同学提出了很多意见：“只念不讲，还不如把讲义发给我们自己看。”经过认真的学习和研究以后，他根据苏联教学大纲写了教学大纲，并利用挂图进行讲课。同学也就满意了，考试成绩很好。有的同学反映：“潘先生近来讲课有了很大改进，重点突出。”考得不好的同学也作了自我检讨：“先生讲的我都懂了，这次答的不好是由于我没有温习，以后要努力。”
    潘钟祥教授在教学上所以能获得较大的改进，主要是由于他自己的努力，而大家对他的帮助，也有很大的作用。
    我做学生时总觉得潘钟祥教授教的都是英美的一套，缺乏实际经验，教学方法也不好，只是平铺直叙地念讲义。我作助教后只是对他埋怨：“教了这么多年书，为什么没有多大改进。”同学收获不多，我也很难提高。同学有了意见，我也只是原封不动地转给他。这种做法不仅不能帮助他，相反地影响了他的情绪。
    后来，我们教员（青年团员）在党的领导下，学习陈伯达同志在中国科学院的报告。陈伯达同志说：“共产党员应该与科学家合作，向他们学习，在工作上帮助他们解决困难”。我们根据这种精神对自己进行了检查。我发现了自己在思想上有很大的缺点。过去我对潘钟祥教授的缺点注意多，而对他的优点则注意的很少。譬如，我总是认为，他缺乏近代探测石油的知识，而没有注意他对鉴定化石等方面的丰富知识。在学习中，我认识了今天祖国需要动员一切能够动员的力量来参加伟大的建设，尤其需要有经验的地质人材。潘钟祥教授的古植物学的丰富知识对煤田地质及石油地质专业有极大用处。我必须帮助他克服工作中的某些缺点，并积极帮助他搞好教学工作。
    因此，我就时刻把陈伯达同志嘱咐我们的话记在心里，决心要帮助潘钟祥教授把课教好。
    我思想上明确认识了党对待知识分子的政策以后，我就研究潘钟祥教授教得不好的原因。为了帮助他克服只念不讲的缺点，我把化石图画在讲义上，最后改画成挂图。这样，他就可以很方便地指着图向同学生动地讲解了。我还向他介绍其他教员备课的经验，使他在讲课前反复思索，讲课时条理清楚，既不重复又有重点。我还有计划地抽时间替他抄讲义、赶挂图。有一次上课前他的讲义还差一些没有编好，我就主动向他提出保证说：“如果您能编好，我保证抄好印出来。”最后我们终于把讲义编好印出。
    我们不仅改变了过去只是批评埋怨的消极态度，积极协助潘钟祥教授改进教学，我并且尊重他的进步，我常因他的进步而高兴起来。当我听到同学因教学有改进而感到满意时，就马上告诉他，同时我将他积极备课的情况也告诉同学。因此潘钟祥教授讲课就有了信心，并积极钻研业务。
    潘钟祥教授也很关心我们的工作，在我忙的时候，他帮助我鉴定实习用的化石，替我修改实习讲义。现在，我觉得和他在一起工作，只要虚心是可以学到很多宝贵的知识的。潘钟祥教授对科学采取严肃认真的态度，这一点是值得学习的。
    潘钟祥教授在工作中有了缺点，我能提出意见和批评。如有一次要讲一种胞子植物，它的胞子和种子很相似，应把二者对比着讲，但是他没有准备种子，便叫我只画胞子。我觉得这是一种不负责任的态度，就提出批评。最后他接受了我的意见，当晚立即翻书查辞典，直到把问题弄清楚才休息。
    我能协助潘钟祥教授改进教学，主要是由于党、青年团对我的教育，使我了解了党的团结改造知识分子的政策，改变了对待教授的不正确态度。今后还有许多工作要作，如精简课程，提高教学质量，协助同学遵守作息制度及加强与同学的联系等，我想只要我努力去作，一定能更好地完成教学任务。
