Southern Shanxi Counties Study Wheat Yield Increase Methods
Will Improve Planting Techniques to Eliminate Disconnected Furrows and Missing Seedlings

Southern Shanxi counties will vigorously overcome the phenomenon of disconnected furrows and missing seedlings in wheat planting. Farmers in this area are accustomed to planting wheat using a seed drill, but due to poor seed drill operation techniques, rough cultivation, or improper seed treatment, the problem of disconnected furrows and missing seedlings in wheat fields is very serious. This spring, an inspection of twenty-one plots of irrigated and dry wheat fields in five villages, including Chen Village in Xia County, revealed a seedling deficiency rate of 14.4%. In some villages in Xie County, Xinjiang, Wanquan, and Jiang County, the seedling deficiency rate in wheat fields was around 20%. This year, Yuncheng Prefecture has sown a total of 7 million mu of wheat. If calculated based on a 15% seedling deficiency rate, it would be equivalent to reducing wheat fields by more than 1 million mu, resulting in an annual reduction of over 100 million jin of wheat. This is a significant loophole in wheat yield increase efforts. Therefore, the special district and various counties, at the wheat bumper harvest representative symposiums held after the wheat harvest, specifically discussed how to eliminate the phenomenon of disconnected furrows and missing seedlings in wheat fields. It was decided to make the elimination of disconnected furrows and missing seedlings a major goal in wheat yield increase efforts. The specific methods for eliminating disconnected furrows and missing seedlings were studied in various locations: First, it is necessary to improve seed drill operation techniques. Within mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives, technical division of labor should be implemented, with skilled individuals specializing in operating the seed drill. At the same time, it is advocated that those who do not know how to operate the seed drill learn from experienced veteran farmers. Second, in terms of land preparation and fertilization, the improvements that should be noted are: when applying base fertilizer, the fertilizer must be well-rotted, crushed, and spread evenly to avoid unrotted or uncrushed manure clumps blocking the seed drill, separating the seeds, or burning the seedlings; when preparing the land, the final plowing before sowing should preferably not exceed the sowing depth to prevent root breakage and seedling death due to soil subsidence after emergence. Fine plowing and harrowing are necessary to remove the roots of previous crops and weeds, making the soil dense and fine, so as to avoid uneven ground during sowing. When sowing, do not sow when the soil is too wet to avoid mud clogging the seed drill's seed outlets. After sowing, in case of rain, use harrows, rollers, or small stone rollers to break up the dried crust to prevent wheat seedlings from failing to emerge, or root breakage due to surface dryness and internal hollowness, followed by soil subsidence. Third, in terms of seed treatment and disaster prevention: wheat seeds should be carefully screened to prevent soil clumps from causing "seed drill blockage." Blighted seeds, broken seeds, and other non-germinating wheat seeds should be removed by using a winnowing fan, sieve, or salt water selection method. Frozen wheat seeds should be subjected to a germination test before use. In areas where seeding is light (e.g., less than five jin per mu), the seeding rate should be appropriately increased.

Before wheat planting, each county will convene symposiums of wheat planting experts by township or village, and conduct specific research in conjunction with local conditions, to generally improve planting techniques. Xie County also plans to select key experimental villages, organize wheat planting experts, and implement contracted planting by zones (work evaluation after seedling emergence) to create experience for completely eliminating the phenomenon of disconnected furrows and missing seedlings in wheat fields.

    山西南部各县研究小麦增产办法
    将改进播种技术消灭断垅缺苗现象
    山西南部各县将在小麦播种工作中大力克服断垅缺苗现象。该地农民种小麦时习惯于耧种，但由于摇耧技术不高、耕作粗糙或种籽处理不严密等原因，麦田断垅缺苗现象很严重。今年春天，检查夏县陈村等五个村二十一块水、旱麦田，缺苗率达百分之十四点四。解县、新绛、万泉、绛县等县的一些村子，麦田缺苗率都在百分之二十左右。运城专区今年共播种小麦七百万亩，如按缺苗百分之十五推算，就等于缩小麦田一百多万亩，每年少产小麦一亿多斤。这是小麦增产工作中一个很大的漏洞。所以该专区和各县在麦收后召开的小麦丰产代表座谈会上，都具体讨论了如何消灭麦田断垅缺苗现象的问题；并决定把消灭断垅缺苗现象，做为小麦增产工作中一个重大的奋斗目标。各地具体研究了消灭断垅缺苗现象的办法：一、首先是要提高摇耧技术。在互助组、农业生产合作社内实行技术分工，由技术高的人专司摇耧。同时提倡不会摇耧的人向有经验的老农学习。二、在整地施肥方面应该注意改进的是：施基肥时，肥料要沤好、弄碎、撒匀，以避免没有沤好或弄碎的粪块挡耧隔籽或烧死幼苗；在整地时，播种前最后一次耕地，最好不超过播种深度，以防止出苗后因土壤下沉而断根死苗。要细犁细耙，除净前茬、草根，使土壤绵密细碎，以免播种时地面高低不平。下种时，墒土太湿时不要下种，以免泥塞耧眼，下种后遇雨，须用耙、耱或小石碾打碎干结的表皮，以免麦苗顶不出来，或因表干里虚、土壤下沉后折断苗根。三、在种籽处理和防止灾害方面：麦籽要经过细心筛拣，不使夹有土块而发生“噎耧”现象。秕籽、破籽及其它不发芽的麦籽要用风车、簸箕或盐水选种等办法把它剔除出去；受冻麦籽更应经过发芽试验后再用。下籽偏少（如每亩五斤以下）地区，要适当增加播种量。
    各县将在种麦前，以乡或村为单位召集种麦行家座谈会，结合当地情况具体研究，以普遍改进播种技术。解县还准备选定重点试验村，组织种麦行家，实行分片包种（出苗后评工），给彻底消灭麦田断垅缺苗现象创造经验。（陈在中）
