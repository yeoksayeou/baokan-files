Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 24th: This agency's special correspondent Wu Min reports: The grave conspiracy of the US side to sabotage the work of explanation to prisoners of war (POWs) by the Korean-Chinese side has now been thoroughly exposed.

Hamblen, commander of the repatriation group on the US side for the explanation work to POWs, sent a letter to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (NNRC) on the 21st, putting forward so-called suggestions regarding the explanation work. Hamblen's letter, from beginning to end, is permeated with a conspiracy, namely: to sabotage the Korean Armistice Agreement and the "Terms of Reference for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," making it impossible for the Korean-Chinese side to carry out the explanation work to the POWs.

Hamblen suggested that each explanation must be conducted with a representative of the detaining side present. The Kuomintang bandit gang's news agency has already hinted that the US side intends to exploit this point by deliberately not sending representatives to prevent the explanation work from being carried out.

Hamblen suggested that during the explanation, POWs have the right to answer questions or "remain silent." The explanation work must be limited to "providing explanations to inquiries." Absolutely "no questions" should be asked during the explanation. Asking POWs questions about their names, addresses, or social status is "completely outside the authority of the explanation personnel." It is obvious that according to Hamblen's suggestion, if the POWs do not raise inquiries, the explanation personnel cannot conduct the explanation. This will inevitably lead to only two situations. One situation is that the special agents mixed among the POWs will not allow the POWs to speak at all, and the other situation is that the special agents will impersonate POWs and raise slanderous so-called "inquiries." In this way, US special agents can boldly impersonate POWs to accept explanations in order to create disturbances. Moreover, if the explanation representatives are absolutely "not allowed to ask questions," then the POWs' so-called right to "answer questions" is completely non-existent; all that remains is the so-called right to "remain silent." This is, in effect, not allowing the POWs to express their desire to be repatriated, so that they continue to be controlled by the special agents and are eventually forcibly detained. The Kuomintang bandit gang's news agency has revealed that Kuomintang special agents will force POWs to say that they want to go to Taiwan and not allow them to say anything else when accepting explanations. This suggestion by the US side fundamentally violates Clause 8 of the Terms of Reference. The explanation and visits stipulated in this clause naturally include conversations between the POWs and the explanation representatives. The purpose is to let the POWs know that they have complete freedom to return home and live peaceful lives. Preventing such conversations is a blatant violation of the Terms of Reference, which is to forcibly detain the POWs, preventing them from returning home to live peaceful lives.

Hamblen also suggested that in order to ensure that there are no so-called "threats, coercion, or disguised insulting behavior," the representative of the original detaining side has the right to interrupt the explanation on behalf of the POWs. This suggestion by the US side violates Clauses 7 and 8 of the Terms of Reference, and brazenly demands the direct sabotage of the explanation work, attempting to weaken the authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. The intention of the US side is to prepare that in the event that the POWs still express their desire for repatriation despite the various restrictions imposed by the US side, the US representative can falsely accuse them of "threats, coercion, or disguised insulting behavior" on the spot and sabotage the explanation, thereby achieving the goal of forcibly detaining the POWs. Hamblen is trying to make people believe that the US representative has the right to represent the POWs, which is utterly absurd. By what right does the US side have to represent the POWs? Is it because they have carried out forced "screenings" of the POWs, forcibly tattooed reactionary words and patterns that insult their personalities on their bodies, and used the special agents of the Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee gangs to impose a reign of terror on the POWs in the dark, that they have the right to represent the POWs? Countless bloody facts have thoroughly exposed the US side's big lie of so-called "voluntary repatriation," which forced the US side to agree to transfer the POWs to the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for explanation by the Korean-Chinese side, so that their repatriation issue could be resolved fairly. The US side's agreement to this point is an admission of guilt, acknowledging that they have no right to speak on behalf of the POWs. However, Hamblen now actually demands that the US representative have the right to interrupt the explanation on behalf of the POWs, which shows how afraid he is of the POWs expressing their true desires! According to Hamblen's logic, shouldn't we conclude that the explanation work does not need to be conducted with the POWs at all, and it is enough to conduct it with the so-called US representative who has the right to represent the POWs? Isn't this absurd to the extreme?

Hamblen also suggested that the explanation work can be conducted in a special explanation area or in the POWs' living quarters. In his letter, Hamblen revealed that the US side will continue to violate Clause 3 of the Terms of Reference, allowing its special agents mixed among the POWs to use force to threaten and suppress all the POWs, preventing them from leaving their barracks or other detention locations to listen to the explanation, thereby further hindering their repatriation home. Hamblen said, "If this situation arises, then it will be necessary to conduct explanations in the POWs' barracks or other detention locations to those POWs who are willing to listen to the explanation." Hamblen's suggestion completely confirms the conspiracy of the US side to sabotage the explanation work as reported by the Korean-Chinese POWs who broke through the US special agent control and returned. These POWs reported that the US side plans to use special agents to forcibly prevent the POWs from leaving their camps to listen to the explanation. When collective explanation work is being conducted, these special agents will force the POWs to play musical instruments to create disturbances, and even use the knives and flagpoles issued by the US side to kill the Korean-Chinese explanation representatives. The US side is conspiring to have the special agents completely control the POWs during collective explanation, making them afraid to express their true desires. United Press reporter Miller has already reported that the special agents "vowed to kill all POW companions who show weakness under Communist persuasion." Therefore, Hamblen's suggestion is actually to completely sabotage the explanation work. The Associated Press has long revealed that the special agents will coerce the POWs "not to come out to listen to what the Communist explanation personnel say to them. Or they will insist on everyone listening to the explanation collectively, which will make it difficult for the explanation personnel to convey their opinions." The Associated Press also revealed that when the Korean-Chinese side's explanation work begins, "bloody resistance incidents may occur."

Hamblen also suggested that POWs can individually or collectively refuse to accept explanations. In other words, the US side wants to fundamentally cancel the explanation work and completely sabotage Clause 8 of the Terms of Reference. The US side is now using special agents to intimidate the POWs, preventing them from accepting explanations. The Korean-Chinese POWs who have returned have already accused the US side of this. United Press reporter Jordan also reported that the US side is violating Clause 3 of the Terms of Reference, instructing special agents posing as POWs to "vow to kill any POW who even attends one explanation meeting." Hamblen is clearly trying to legalize the special agents' conspiratorial activities in order to forcibly detain all the POWs.

It is very obvious that the purpose of Hamblen's so-called suggestions is to cancel the Korean-Chinese side's right to conduct explanations to the POWs, deprive the POWs of their right to be repatriated according to Clause 1 of the Terms of Reference, and deprive them of their right to accept explanations according to Clause 8. Clause 8 of the "Terms of Reference for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" attached to the Korean Armistice Agreement stipulates that both sides should send representatives "to explain to all prisoners of war attached to that Power their rights and to inform them of any matters relating to their return to their homelands, in particular their complete freedom to return home and live peaceful lives." Everyone knows that the reason for making such a provision in the Armistice Agreement is that the US side insisted that a large number of Korean-Chinese POWs "refused repatriation," but in reality, this was entirely the result of the US side using Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee gang special agents to threaten and intimidate the POWs. In order to safeguard the right of every POW to be repatriated, the Armistice Agreement stipulates that the explanation representatives should conduct explanations to "all" POWs. This means that the explanation representatives must conduct explanations and visits to every POW. If the US side wants to prove that they have not threatened and intimidated the POWs, and prove that the POWs are really "preferring suicide rather than returning home" as they have publicized, then they should allow the Korean-Chinese side to conduct explanations to all the POWs. The US side is now attempting to use special agents mixed among the POWs to forcibly coerce the POWs to refuse to accept explanations, and prevent the POWs from freely expressing their desire for repatriation, which shows that the US side has a guilty conscience!

The most telling sign of the US side's shamelessness and guilty conscience is that Hamblen actually opposed a method designed by the Indian side that might barely allow the POWs to exercise their right to be repatriated. The method proposed that after each explanation, the POWs, when leaving the explanation location, should, according to their own choice, leave through three exits separately. One exit is for those who want to be repatriated, one exit is for those who have not made up their minds, and the other exit is for those who do not want to be repatriated. Hamblen actually criticized this method as "unfair"! And he nonsensically claimed that the POWs have already "made a choice, and if due to the influence of the explanation and temporary confusion" they walk out of the exit for those who want to be repatriated, then this procedure is in violation of the Armistice Agreement. This absurd claim by the US side violates the main provisions of Clauses 1 and 7 of the Terms of Reference. Clause 1 of the Terms of Reference stipulates that POWs "shall have the opportunity to exercise their right to be repatriated" and stipulates the establishment of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for this purpose, and Clause 7 stipulates that the power of the commission to exercise its legitimate functions and responsibilities shall not be weakened, but the US side's claim not only violates these clauses, but also accuses the Indian design of violating the agreement. This proves that the US side is extremely afraid that the POWs will walk out of the exit for those who want to be repatriated under conditions that are relatively free from threats and suppression. Because this will give a large number of POWs a greater opportunity to exercise their right to be repatriated, thereby thoroughly exposing the US side's various malicious and brutal crimes of forcibly detaining the POWs. Obviously, if the POWs were not under the US side's brutal and unparalleled control and oppression, and eagerly hoping to return to their homeland after years of suffering, the US side would not have to oppose this relatively fair and more in line with the provisions of the Armistice Agreement and the "Terms of Reference for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" in such an ugly and shameless manner.

In his letter, Hamblen also said, "If a prisoner of war does not wish to return to the control area of ​​the other party during the ninety-day explanation period, then, viewed as an individual, he will never again be considered an object of consideration by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission or its affiliated organizations." Hamblen's argument first violates the Armistice Agreement. Clause 11 of the "Terms of Reference for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" attached to the Korean Armistice Agreement stipulates that the issue of the treatment of POWs who have not exercised their right to repatriation after ninety days of being placed in the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission should be resolved by the political conference within thirty days. During this period, the POWs continue to be held in the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. "Any prisoner of war who has not exercised his right to repatriation within one hundred and twenty days after the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission is responsible for holding them and has not been agreed upon by the political conference for any other treatment method shall be declared by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to be released from their prisoner of war status and made civilians, and then, according to their individual applications, those who choose to go to the neutral country shall be assisted by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Red Cross. This work should be completed within thirty days..." According to this clause, any POW is still an object of consideration by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission or its affiliated organizations within sixty days after the expiration of the ninety-day explanation period. As long as he requests repatriation or requests to go to a neutral country, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has the responsibility to fulfill his request.

The reason why Hamblen wants to put forward this argument that violates the Armistice Agreement is obviously because he is afraid that the POWs will still request repatriation after ninety days, so that Hamblen's carefully arranged set of tricks to obstruct the explanation work will fail.

Hamblen's suggestions fully confirm that even after the POWs were handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee gangs were still carrying out a reign of terror among the POWs, unscrupulously intimidating the POWs. This is absolutely not allowed. The existence of this situation clearly violates Clause 3 of the "Terms of Reference for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission." This clause stipulates: "Force shall not be used against prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated, nor shall the use of force or threats of force be used to obstruct or force them to be repatriated, and violence shall not be permitted in any way or for any purpose against the persons of prisoners of war or to insult their dignity or self-esteem. This task shall be entrusted to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission." The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission now has the responsibility to eliminate all the special agents mixed among the POWs, and not allow this kind of threat and violence to continue to exist, so that the explanation work can proceed normally. Hamblen actually pretends to say in his letter that when formulating all the explanation rules, the main principle stipulated in Clause 3 should be taken into account. This hypocritical face is really disgusting!

Hamblen's so-called suggestions violate almost all the main clauses of the "Terms of Reference for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission." In fact, they are trying to turn the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission from an organization that safeguards the POWs' right to repatriation into a tool for the US side to forcibly detain the POWs; at the same time, they are also trying to tear up the POW agreement of the "Terms of Reference for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission." All of this shows that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission is facing a serious test: in order for the "Terms of Reference for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" to be implemented, and in order for the neutral countries to be able to freely and fairly exercise their powers, the only way is to reject all of Hamblen's absurd suggestions, accept the reasonable proposals of the Korean-Chinese side, and fairly safeguard and implement the solemn agreement of the "Terms of Reference for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission."

    新华社记者揭露美方破坏解释工作的阴谋
    【新华社开城二十四日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：美方破坏朝中方面对战俘进行解释工作的重大阴谋，现在已经彻底暴露。
    美方对战俘进行解释工作的遣返组司令汉布伦在二十一日写信给中立国遣返委员会，对解释工作提出所谓建议。汉布伦这封信，从头到尾贯穿着一个阴谋，这就是：破坏朝鲜停战协定及“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”，使朝中方面对战俘的解释工作根本无法进行。
    汉布伦建议：每一次的解释必须在拘留一方的代表到场时进行。国民党匪帮的通讯社已经暗示美方企图利用这一点，故意不派代表出席，使解释工作无法进行。
    汉布伦建议：在进行解释时，战俘有回答问题或“保持沉默”的权利。解释工作必须只限于“对询问提出解释”。在解释时绝对“不能发问”。询问战俘的名字、住址或社会地位等问题“完全不在解释人员的权限之内”。很明显，按照汉布伦的建议，如果战俘不提出询问，解释人员就不能进行解释。这样就必然只能发生两种情况。一种情况是混在战俘中间的特务根本不许战俘说话，另一种情况是特务冒充战俘提出诬蔑性的所谓“询问”。这样，美方特务可以大胆冒充战俘来接受解释，以便进行捣乱。而且，如果解释代表绝对“不能发问”，那末战俘的所谓“回答问题”的权利是根本不存在的，剩下来的只有所谓“保持沉默”的权利，这实际上就是不许战俘表示他们要求遣返的愿望，使他们继续受特务的控制而终于被强迫扣留。国民党匪帮的通讯社已经透露，国民党特务将强迫战俘在接受解释时，除了说要到台湾去以外，不许说旁的话。美方的这个建议根本违反了职权范围第八款的规定。这一款规定的解释和访问，当然就包括了战俘与解释代表之间的交谈。其目的是使战俘知道他们有回家过和平生活的完全自由，不许有这种交谈就是对于职权范围粗暴的破坏，就是要强迫扣留战俘，使之不能回家过和平生活。
    汉布伦还建议，为了保证不发生所谓“威胁、强迫或伪装的侮辱行为”，原拘留一方的代表有权代表战俘使解释中断。美方的这个建议违反了职权范围第七、八两款的规定，而粗暴地要求直接破坏解释工作，企图削弱中立国遣返委员会的权力。美方的用意是准备万一在美方作了种种限制，战俘却仍然要表示遣返的愿望时，美方代表就可以当面诬赖说发生“威胁、强迫或伪装的侮辱行为”而破坏解释，从而达到强迫扣留战俘的目的。汉布伦企图使人相信美方代表有权代表战俘，这真是荒谬绝伦。美方凭什么有权利代表战俘？难道因为他们对战俘进行了强迫“甄别”，在战俘身上强迫刺上侮辱他们人格的反动词句和花样，利用国民党和李承晚匪帮的特务分子对战俘施行了暗无天日的恐怖统治，所以他们就有权代表战俘吗？无数血腥的事实已经彻底揭穿了美方所谓“自愿遣返”的大骗局，这才迫使美方不得不同意将战俘移交给中立国遣返委员会看管，由朝中方面进行解释，以使他们的遣返问题得到公正的解决。美方同意了这一点，就是自知理屈，承认他们无权代表战俘说话。可是，汉布伦现在却居然要求让美方代表有权代表战俘中断解释工作，这说明他害怕战俘表达真正愿望到了何等程度！按照汉布伦的逻辑，岂不是应该得出结论：解释工作完全不必对战俘进行，只要对所谓有权代表战俘的美方代表进行就可以了。这难道不是荒谬到了极点吗？
    汉布伦还建议，解释工作可以在特别解释地区或在战俘所住的营房内进行。汉布伦在信中透露美方将继续破坏职权范围第三款，使其混在战俘中的美方特务，以武力威胁压制全部战俘，不许他们离开他们的营房或其他拘留地点去听解释，从而进一步阻挠他们遣返回家。汉布伦说，“如果产生了这种形势，那末，便有必要在战俘的营房或其他拘留地点向那些愿意听取解释的战俘进行解释。”汉布伦的这个建议，完全证实了突破美方特务控制归来的朝中被俘人员所报告的美方破坏解释工作的阴谋。这些被俘人员报告说，美方准备利用特务以武力强迫战俘拒绝离开营场去听解释。当集体解释工作进行时，这些特务将强迫战俘吹打乐器来进行扰乱，甚至用美方发给他们的刀子和旗杆来杀害朝中解释代表。美方阴谋在集体解释时由特务们完全控制战俘，使他们不敢表达他们的真正愿望。合众社记者米勒已经报道说，特务们“发誓说要杀死所有在共产党劝说下表示软弱的战俘同伴”。因此，汉布伦这个建议实际上就是要彻底破坏解释工作。美联社早已透露，特务分子将胁迫战俘“不出来听共产党解释人员向他们说的话。或者他们将坚持大伙人集体听解释，这样，解释人员要传达他们的意见就困难了”。美联社还透露，当朝中方面的解释工作开始时，“可能会发生流血的反抗事件”。
    汉布伦还建议，战俘可以个别或集体拒绝接受解释。换句话说，美方要根本取消解释工作，彻底破坏职权范围第八款。美方现在正在利用特务恐吓战俘，不许他们接受解释。遣返归来的朝中被俘人员已经控诉了这一点。合众社记者约旦也报道说，美方破坏职权范围第三款，指使冒充战俘的特务“誓言要杀死任何即使只参加一个解释会议的战俘”。汉布伦显然是要把特务们的这个阴谋活动合法化，以便强迫扣留全体战俘。
    十分明显，汉布伦的所谓建议，其目的就是要取消朝中方面对战俘进行解释的权利，剥夺战俘根据职权范围第一款应该行使的被遣返的权利并剥夺他们根据第八款接受解释的权利。朝鲜停战协定附件“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”第八款规定，双方应派出代表，“向一切依附于该所属国家的战俘解释他们的权利，并通知他们任何有关他们回返家乡的事项，特别是他们有回家过和平生活的完全自由”。大家知道，停战协定中所以作出这样的规定，是因为美方硬说有大批朝中被俘人员“拒绝遣返”，而实际上，这完全是美方利用国民党和李承晚匪帮特务对战俘进行威胁恐吓的结果。为了维护每一个战俘的被遣返的权利，所以停战协定中规定解释代表向“一切”战俘进行解释。这就是说，解释代表必须向每一个战俘进行解释和访问。美方如果要想证明他们没有对战俘进行威胁和恐吓，证明战俘真的是如他们所宣传的“宁可自杀也不愿回家”，那末，他们就应该允许朝中方面向所有战俘进行解释。美方现在企图利用混在战俘中间的特务分子，用武力胁迫战俘拒绝接受解释，并且使战俘不能自由表达他们要求遣返的愿望，这说明美方是做贼心虚！
    最足以表现美方丧尽廉耻作贼心虚的一点是：汉布伦竟在他的信中反对印度方面所设计的一个勉强可能使战俘行使其被遣返权利的办法。该办法主张在每次解释之后，战俘在离开解释地点时，得按照自己的选择，分别从三道出口出去。一道是愿意遣返者的出口，一道是未打定主意者的出口，再一道是不愿遣返者的出口。汉布伦竟批驳这个办法“不公平”！并胡说什么战俘已经“作了选择，如果由于解释的影响以及一时糊涂”而走出愿意遣返的出口，那末，这个手续就是违背停战协定。美方这个荒谬绝伦的主张违反了职权范围的主要条文第一款和第七款。职权范围第一款规定战俘“有机会行使其被遣返的权利”并规定为此而成立中立国遣返委员会，第七款规定不得削弱该委员会行使其合法职务和责任的权力，而美方的主张则不仅违背这些条款，反而反咬印度的设计是违反协定。这证明美方极端害怕战俘会在比较不受威胁和压制的情况下走出愿意遣返者的出口。因为这样将使大批战俘较有机会实行被遣返的权利，从而彻底暴露美方强迫扣留战俘的种种恶毒残暴罪行。显然，如果战俘们不是在美方残暴绝伦的控制和压迫之下，度日如年地迫切希望得返祖国的话，美方是不必这样丑恶、这样无耻地来反对这个比较公平、比较符合于停战协定及“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的规定的。
    汉布伦在他的信中还说，“如果战俘在九十天的解释期间自己不愿要求回到对方的控制区去，那末，作为一个单独的人看待，他将永远不能再成为中立国遣返委员会或它的附属机构的一个被考虑的对象。”汉布伦这个论点，首先就是违反停战协定的。朝鲜停战协定附件“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”第十一款规定，在战俘移交中立国遣返委员会看管九十天之后，未行使遣返权利的战俘的处理问题应交由政治会议在三十天内设法解决。在此期间，战俘继续由中立国遣返委员会看管。“任何战俘，凡在中立国遣返委员会负责看管他们后的一百二十天内尚未行使其被遣返权利又未经政治会议为他们协议出任何其他处理办法者，应由中立国遣返委员会宣布解除他们的战俘身分使之成为平民，然后根据各人的申请，其中凡有选择前往中立国者，应由中立国遣返委员会和印度红十字会予以协助。这一工作应在三十天内完成……”根据这一款的规定，任何战俘在九十天解释期满以后的六十天之内，仍然是中立国遣返委员会或其附属机构的一个被考虑的对象，只要他提出要求遣返或要求到中立国去，中立国遣返委员会就有责任满足他的要求。
    汉布伦所以要提出这个违反停战协定的论点，显然是因为害怕战俘在九十天之后仍然要求遣返，从而使汉布伦为了阻挠解释工作而精心布置的一套鬼把戏归于失败。
    汉布伦的建议完全证实了：即使在战俘被移交给了中立国遣返委员会以后，国民党和李承晚匪帮仍然在战俘中间实行着恐怖统治，肆无忌惮地恫吓着战俘。这是绝对不能允许的。这种情况的存在，显然破坏了“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”第三款的规定。这一款规定：对不直接遣返战俘“不得使用武力或以武力威胁以阻挠或强使其遣返，不得允许以任何方式或为任何目的，对战俘人身施以暴力或侮辱其尊严或自尊。这一任务应交托于中立国遣返委员会”。中立国遣返委员会现在有责任肃清混在战俘中间的一切特务分子，不许这种威胁和暴力行为继续存在，以便解释工作得以正常进行。汉布伦在他的信中居然还假惺惺地说，在拟订一切解释规则的时候，应当考虑到第三款中所规定这一主要原则，这种伪善的面目真是令人作呕！
    汉布伦的所谓建议违反了“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”几乎全部主要条文，实际上就是企图使中立国遣返委员会从维护战俘遣返权利的机构，一变而成为美方强迫扣留战俘的工具；同时它也就是要撕毁“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的战俘协议。这一切说明，中立国遣返委员会已经面临了一个严重的考验：为了使“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”得以实施，为了使中立国能够自由地公正地行使职权，就只有拒绝汉布伦的这一切荒谬的建议，接受朝中方面的合理主张公正地维护和执行庄严的“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的协议。
