Outstanding Performances, Shining Examples
— A Feature on the Soviet Sports Delegation’s First Gymnastics Performance
Xiao Yuan

    The Soviet Sports Delegation held its first gymnastics performance in the capital on the evening of the 19th. The delegation's athletes' superior skills were unanimously praised by the audience.

    The entire program of the performance was extremely exciting, including a total of thirteen programs in nine categories, featuring men's and women's floor exercises, women's balance beam, uneven bars, group exercises (hoop performance), men's pommel horse, parallel bars, horizontal bar, rings, and vault performed by all athletes. These wonderful performances powerfully demonstrated the brilliant achievements of Soviet sports, especially gymnastics; at the same time, they showed the healthy, happy characteristics and the clever, tenacious, and brave qualities of the Soviet people.

    At the beginning of the performance, the first to appear in front of the sky-blue backdrop was Soviet champion and Honored Master of Sports, Urbonavičiūtė. This outstanding gymnast from Lithuania, although thirty-six years old, showed such graceful, supple movements and skilled, coordinated actions as she performed floor exercises with balance, handstands, rolls, jumps, etc., to the melody of the music, giving people a relaxed and pleasant feeling. A total of eleven male and female athletes performed floor exercises, and they all gave us a profound impression of being vigorous and graceful, agile and harmonious.

    On the balance beam, which is only ten centimeters wide, fifteenth Olympic Games champion, fourth World Festival of Youth and Students for Peace and Friendship (hereinafter referred to as the Fourth Youth Friendship Festival) all-around champion, and Honored Master of Sports Bochvarova, and Soviet champion and Honored Master of Sports Sharobidze struck beautiful dance poses with steady and skilled movements, winning warm applause.

    Women's uneven bar exercise is not yet very common in our country. It is a complex and demanding apparatus exercise. The exciting performances of Bochvarova, Soviet and fifteenth Olympic Games champion and Honored Master of Sports Kalinchuk, Soviet champion and Honored Master of Sports Zhugri, and others were truly astonishing. They sometimes shuttled back and forth, tumbling and leaping, and sometimes hung upside down on the thin horizontal bar. These accurate and balanced movements demonstrated the human ability to highly and evenly control their bodies.

    The men's pommel horse exercise was performed by Soviet all-around champion, Fourth Youth Friendship Festival champion, and Honored Master of Sports Muratov, Soviet champion, fifteenth Olympic Games and Fourth Youth Friendship Festival all-around champion, and Honored Master of Sports Chukarin, as well as two Honored Masters of Sports and two sports athletes. Supporting themselves on the pommel horse handles, the horse's head, and the horse's tail with their arms, they split or joined their legs and rotated back and forth on the horse in a very coordinated manner, like a light swallow gently skimming across the ground, giving people a light yet very strong sense of beauty.

    In the horizontal bar, parallel bars, and rings events, Soviet athletes not only demonstrated their highly accomplished skills and athletic physiques but also fully revealed their noble qualities of not being afraid of difficulties or dangers, and being resolute and brave. Chukarin, Muratov, Belyakov, Popov, Belileman, and other outstanding athletes were able to handle extremely difficult movements such as back somersaults and handstand changes on the parallel bars, or various rotations, handstands, cartwheels, aerial somersault dismounts on the horizontal bar with ease. Armenian-born Soviet champion and sports athlete Azaryan, a blacksmith by trade, has enviable strong arms. Because of his amazing arm strength, he performed movements requiring a high degree of exercise on the rings, such as the cross and reverse cross hangs, with ease and pleasure.

    The performance concluded with a highly artistic women's hoop gymnastics routine. The neat and light dance steps and vigorous movements of the eight female athletes were deeply admired by the audience.

    The entire gymnastics performance of the Soviet Sports Delegation, although only lasting for two hours, gave us many valuable insights. The most important of these is the mass character of Soviet sports and the scientific nature of their training methods. Sports have become an important part of the lives of the Soviet people. Among the members of this delegation, there were representatives from various Soviet republics, as well as students and workers. For example, Muratov, who won the 1953 Soviet Men's Gymnastics All-Around Championship, and Konovalova, who won the Women's Gymnastics All-Around Championship, are both newly emerging normal school students. The brilliant achievements of Soviet gymnasts are inseparable from their adherence to comprehensive, long-term, and highly demanding scientific training. As the head of the delegation, Gramadsky, said: "Based on these training principles, Soviet gymnasts have achieved excellent results in every international competition."

    This visit to China by the Soviet Sports Delegation, like the visit to our country in 1950 by the sports delegation composed of the most outstanding Soviet basketball players, will not only promote the close friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, especially the athletes and sports workers of the two countries, but also play a huge role in improving and promoting the development of gymnastics in our country, both technically and ideologically.

    杰出的表演、光辉的榜样
    ——苏联体育代表团首次体操表演特写
    肖远
    苏联体育代表团于十九日晚在首都举行了首次体操表演。代表团全体运动员的优越技巧，受到了观众的一致赞扬。
    表演会的全部节目是十分精彩的，总共包括了由男女运动员表演的自由体操，女子平衡木、高低杠、团体操（藤圈表演），男子木马（鞍马）、双杠、单杠、吊环及全体运动员表演的跳马等九类十三个节目。这些精彩的表演，有力地说明了苏联体育运动，特别是体操运动的辉煌成就；同时，也显示了苏联人民健康、愉快的特色和机敏、顽强、勇敢的品质。
    表演会开始，首先出现在天蓝色天幕前面的，是苏联冠军、功勋选手乌尔芭诺维奇。这个立陶宛的优秀体操运动员，虽然有了三十六岁的年纪，但当她随着音乐的旋律，表演平衡、倒立、滚翻、跳跃等动作的自由体操时，却有着多么优美、柔软的体态和纯熟、协调的动作，给人们以轻松、愉快的感觉。表演自由体操的共有十一位男女运动员，他们都给了我们刚劲而又优美、敏捷而又合韵的深刻的印象。
    在仅有十公分宽的平衡木上，第十五届国际奥林匹克运动会冠军、第四届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节（以下简称第四届青年友谊联欢节）绝对冠军、功勋选手柏查罗娃和苏联冠军、功勋选手沙罗比泽以稳定熟练的动作作出美丽的舞蹈姿势，博得了热烈的掌声。
    女子高低杠运动，在我国还很不普遍，这是一项动作复杂，运动量较大的器械体操。柏查罗娃以及苏联和第十五届奥林匹克运动会冠军、功勋选手卡琳楚克，苏联冠军、功勋选手朱格丽等七人令人兴奋的演出，实在使人惊奇。她们时而穿梭般的往来回转、腾越，时而悬垂倒立在细细的横杠上，这些准确、平衡的动作，表现了人类高度均衡地控制自己躯体的能力。
    男子鞍马运动，由苏联绝对冠军、第四届青年友谊联欢节冠军、功勋选手穆拉托夫，苏联冠军、第十五届国际奥林匹克运动会和第四届青年友谊联欢节绝对冠军、功勋选手朱卡林及两位功勋选手、两位运动选手表演，他们以两臂支撑着马鞍把手、马头、马尾，十分协调地分腿或并腿在马身上来回旋转，有如一只轻盈的燕子，轻轻地从地面掠过，给人以轻松却又是十分强健的美感。
    在单杠、双杠和吊环的表演项目中，苏联运动员们，不仅表现了他们造诣极深的技巧和健美的体格，并且充分表露了他们有着不怕困难，不怕艰险，坚决、勇敢的高贵品质。朱卡林、穆拉托夫、别利耶科夫、波波夫、别里列曼和其他优秀运动员，无论在双杠上作后腾空翻、倒立换把，或在单杠上作各种回旋、倒立、车轮、空翻转体下等极为困难的动作，都能操纵自如。阿尔明尼亚人、铁匠出身的苏联冠军、运动选手阿札良，他的粗壮的胳臂，令人羡慕，由于他有惊人的臂力，在吊环运动中需要高度运动量的十字悬垂、反十字悬垂等动作，也作来轻松、愉快。
    表演会最后演出了有高度艺术性的女子藤圈体操。八个女运动员的整齐而又轻快的舞步和矫健的动作，深受观众的赞美。
    苏联体育代表团的全部体操表演，虽然仅仅只有两个多钟头的时间，但却给了我们许多珍贵的启示，其中最重要的，就是苏联体育运动的群众性和训练方法的科学性。体育运动，已成为苏联人民生活的重要内容，在这次代表团的团员中，有来自苏联各加盟共和国的代表，有学生也有工人。如荣获一九五三年苏联男子体操绝对冠军的穆拉托夫和女子体操绝对冠军科诺瓦洛娃，都是新近涌现出来的师范学校学生。苏联体操运动员的光辉成就是和他们坚持全面的、长期的、高度运动量的科学训练分不开的。正如代表团团长格拉玛德斯基所说：根据这些训练原则，苏联体操运动员在每次国际比赛中，都获得优异的成绩。
    这一次苏联体育代表团的来华访问，正如一九五○年由最优秀的苏联篮球运动员组成的体育代表团来我国访问一样，不但会促进中苏两国人民、特别是中苏两国运动员和体育工作者的亲密友谊，而且，对我国体操运动的开展，无论是在技术上和思想上都会起到巨大的提高和推动的作用。
