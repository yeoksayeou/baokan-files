	Xinjiang People's Publishing House Publishes a Large Number of Primary and Secondary School Textbooks in Various Ethnic Languages
	This year, the Xinjiang People's Publishing House has compiled and published a large number of primary and secondary school textbooks in various ethnic languages.
	As of August this year, the Xinjiang People's Publishing House has published more than 453,000 copies of primary and secondary school textbooks in four languages: Han, Uyghur, Kazakh, and Mongolian. These include the Uyghur, Kazakh, and Mongolian translations of the junior high school history and geography textbooks published by the Central People's Education Publishing House, the reprinted version of the Mongolian primary school textbooks published by the Education Department of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and the Uyghur and Kazakh primary school textbooks edited by the Xinjiang People's Publishing House itself. In addition, the Xinjiang People's Publishing House has also compiled primary school language and arithmetic textbooks for grades one and two in Xibe, which are now in print.
	Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Begins Venereal Disease Eradication Work
	In order to completely relieve the pain of diseases suffered by herdsmen of all ethnic groups for many years, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has begun to eradicate venereal diseases. The Autonomous Region People's Government has transferred more than 260 health cadres of all ethnic groups and established the Inner Mongolia Venereal Disease Prevention and Treatment Institute in Hailar City. In early September, the institute sent three medical teams to Chen Barag Banner and Solon Banner in Hulunbuir League to conduct typical experiments on venereal disease eradication. Before the end of October, more than 11,000 herdsmen in these two banners will receive physical examinations, and 1,200 of them will receive treatment. In addition, 5,400 Mongolian herdsmen in the New Barag Right Banner of the league will also undergo general physical examinations this winter.
	This venereal disease eradication in Inner Mongolia adopts the Soviet long-term combined therapy based on arsenic. One course of the new therapy takes 45 days, with a 15-day break between each course. The most severe cases require five courses of treatment, lasting about one year and three months, to be completely cured. In order to avoid affecting the production of herdsmen, the Venereal Disease Prevention and Treatment Institute has decided to adopt a decentralized treatment method and organize mutual assistance among herdsmen when necessary.
	In the past three years, a general treatment for syphilis was carried out in thirteen banners in the pastoral areas of Hulunbuir League, Xilin Gol League, and Chahar League in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which has initially restored the health of more than 40,000 herdsmen of all ethnic groups. The pastoral areas have begun to show a new atmosphere of population growth and prosperity.

    新疆人民出版社大量出版各民族语文的中小学课本
    新疆人民出版社今年大量编译和出版了各民族语文的中、小学课本。
    到今年八月为止，新疆人民出版社已经用汉、维吾尔、哈萨克和蒙古四种文字出版了中、小学课本四十五万三千多册。其中包括有中央人民教育出版社出版的初中历史、初中地理课本的维、哈、蒙三种文字的翻译本，内蒙古自治区人民政府教育部出版的蒙文小学课本的翻印本和新疆人民出版社自己编辑的维、哈两种文字的小学课本等。此外，新疆人民出版社今年还编辑了锡伯文的小学一、二年级语文和算术课本，现在已经付印。
    内蒙古自治区开始进行性病根治工作
    为了彻底解除各族牧民多年来的疾病痛苦，内蒙古自治区开始根治性病。自治区人民政府已抽调各族卫生干部二百六十多名，在海拉尔市设立了内蒙古性病防治所。九月初，该所先后派出三个医疗队，前往呼纳盟陈巴尔虎旗和索伦旗进行根治性病的典型试验。这两个旗在十月底以前，将有一万一千多名牧民受到体格检查，其中一千二百名将得到治疗。另外，该盟新巴尔虎右翼旗的五千四百名蒙族牧民在今年冬季也将普遍检查身体。
    内蒙古这次性病根治，是采取苏联以砒剂为主的长期混合疗法。新疗法的一个疗程需时四十五天，每一疗程完毕有十五天的休药期。病情最重的需经过五个疗程、约一年零三个月的治疗才能彻底治愈。为避免影响牧民生产，性病防治所决定采取分散治疗的方式，必要时组织牧民互助。
    按内蒙古自治区呼纳盟、锡林郭勒盟、察哈尔盟牧区十三个旗，在过去三年中曾普遍进行一次治疗梅毒，使四万多名各族牧民初步恢复了健康，牧区开始呈现人口上升、欣欣向荣的新气象。
