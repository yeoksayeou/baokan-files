Famous painter Xu Beihong Dies in Beijing

The renowned painter, President of the Central Academy of Fine Arts, and Chairman of the All-China Artists Association, Mr. Xu Beihong, passed away at the Beijing Hospital at 2:52 AM on September 26th due to a recurrence of cerebral hemorrhage, despite treatment. Mr. Xu was a native of Yixing, Jiangsu Province, born in 1895. He devoted over thirty years to art creation and art education. In 1934, he held a personal art exhibition in the Soviet Union. In artistic creation, he consistently opposed formalism and adhered to a realistic style. His works absorbed the advanced techniques of Western painting and inherited the excellent traditions of national painting, creating his own unique style. Throughout his life, he spared no effort in cultivating young artists. In 1952, while ill, he sent his works to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers fighting in Korea, inspiring their fighting spirit. During his previous illness, he instructed his wife, Ms. Liao Jingwen, to donate his creations and his entire collection of Chinese and foreign artworks to the state. The death of Mr. Xu Beihong is a major loss to China's literary and art circles. Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the Central People's Government, Vice Premier Guo Moruo, Shen Yanbing, Minister of the Central Ministry of Culture, Vice Minister Zhou Yang, and figures from the literary and art circles and friends of Mr. Xu during his lifetime, such as Zheng Zhenduo, Tian Han, and Ye Gongchuo, all paid their respects upon hearing the news. The preparatory committee for the Second Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Workers is currently handling the funeral arrangements. (Xinhua News Agency) (Attached image)

    名画家徐悲鸿先生在北京逝世
    著名画家、中央美术学院院长、中华全国美术工作者协会主席徐悲鸿先生，因脑溢血症复发，治疗无效，于九月二十六日晨二时五十二分在北京医院逝世。徐先生江苏宜兴人，生于一八九五年，致力美术创作和美术教育凡三十余年。一九三四年曾在苏联举行个人画展。在艺术创作上一贯反对形式主义，坚持写实作风，他的作品吸取了西方绘画的先进技术，继承了民族绘画的优秀传统，创造了自己的独特风格。生平对青年美术工作者的培养不遗余力。在一九五二年病中，他曾将自己的作品寄给抗美援朝志愿军战士，激发了战士们的战斗情绪。在前次患病时，他曾嘱其夫人廖静文先生将自己的创作和全部珍藏的中外美术作品捐献国家。徐悲鸿先生的逝世，是我国文艺界的重大损失。中央人民政府政务院总理周恩来、副总理郭沫若，中央文化部部长沈雁冰、副部长周扬，文艺界及徐氏生前友好郑振铎、田汉、叶恭绰等闻耗后均亲往吊唁。现正由中国文学艺术工作者第二次代表大会筹备治丧事宜。（新华社）（附图片）
