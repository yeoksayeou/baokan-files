The Film Bureau of the Central Ministry of Culture is Determined to Run the Film School's Film Processing Specialty Course Well

Letter from the Film Bureau of the Central Ministry of Culture: We began inspecting and studying how to improve the teaching work of the Film School's film processing specialty course on July 15th. The criticism letter published in the "Reader's Letters Summary" column on August 11th further promoted this work. Now, we will explain the results of our inspection and our opinions on future improvement work as follows:

The chaotic situation in the teaching work of the film processing specialty course is indeed very serious, and the Film Bureau should bear the main responsibility for this situation. When we started the film processing specialty course, we only considered the shortage of film processing cadres and the urgent need for training; however, we lacked sufficient ideological and material preparation for how to run such an advanced film processing specialty course well. As a result, after the school opened, we felt the lack of teachers and teaching materials, and we had to start classes reluctantly. Teachers were found and pieced together as needed, which resulted in a chaotic and poor teaching performance throughout the year. In addition, the Film Bureau has not had a dedicated person to manage the work of the film school for a long time, and the film school leadership has also used the excuse of not understanding the business to abandon leadership over the teaching work of the film processing specialty course, which has made it impossible to correct the chaotic situation in the teaching work of the film processing specialty course in a timely manner.

At present, there is still a shortage of film processing technicians, and the film processing specialty course needs to be run. Based on our existing conditions, it is entirely possible to run it well. We have determined that the training goal of the film processing specialty course is to cultivate film processing personnel with the level of more advanced technicians, and the training goal of the secondary technical course is to cultivate film processing personnel with the level of intermediate technicians. According to objective needs and existing conditions, the teaching plans of the film processing specialty course and the secondary film processing technology course focus on professional courses, and at the same time combine with practical problems in the production process to enrich the teaching content and closely link school teaching with production. In addition, we have decided that the technical departments of the Film Bureau will be responsible for guiding the technical departments of the Film School in the future, and we have appropriately transferred cadres and allocated equipment to strengthen the leadership of the film processing specialty course and solve the problems of insufficient teachers and equipment.

### 中央文化部电影局决心办好电影学校洗印专修科

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    中央文化部电影局决心办好电影学校洗印专修科
    中央人民政府文化部电影局来信：我们在七月十五日已开始检查并研究改进电影学校洗印专修科的教学工作。八月十一日“读者来信摘要”栏发表的对我们的批评信更推进了这个工作。现将我们的检查结果及对今后改进工作的意见说明如下：
    洗印专修科教学工作中的混乱状况的确非常严重，电影局应该对这种情况负主要责任。我们在开办洗印专修科时，只考虑洗印干部缺乏，亟待培养；但对如何办好这样一个较高级的洗印专修科，缺少充分的思想准备与物质准备。这样，学校开办后，师资和教材都感缺少，只得勉强开课，教师现抓现凑，因而一年来教学工作混乱，效果很差。此外，电影局长时期来没有专人管理电影学校的工作，电影学校领导方面也藉口不懂业务，对洗印专修科的教学工作放弃领导，更使洗印专修科教学工作中的混乱状况不能及时纠正。
    目前洗印技术人员仍然缺乏，洗印专修科需要办，根据我们现有条件也完全可能办好。我们确定了洗印专修科的培养目标是具有较高级技术员水平的洗印工作人员，中等技术科的培养目标是中级技术员水平的洗印工作人员。根据客观需要及现有条件，洗印专修科与洗印中等技术的教学计划以专业课为主，同时结合生产过程中的实际问题，以充实教学内容，并使学校教学与生产密切联系。此外，我们决定今后电影学校技术系科统由电影局技术部门负责指导，并已适当抽调干部和调拨设备，以加强洗印专修科的领导力量和解决师资、设备不足的问题。
