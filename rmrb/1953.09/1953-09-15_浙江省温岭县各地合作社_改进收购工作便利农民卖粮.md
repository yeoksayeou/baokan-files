Cooperatives in Various Areas of Wenling County, Zhejiang Province
Improve Procurement Work to Facilitate Farmers' Grain Sales

Cooperatives in various areas of Wenling County, Zhejiang Province, have improved their methods of procuring rice, powerfully promoting the progress of procurement work.

In the past, farmers felt that selling grain to the cooperatives was too troublesome and took too long. They said that the cooperatives had "three no's" – no receiving before business hours, no receiving after business hours, and no receiving on rainy days. Therefore, they were not very willing to sell grain to the cooperatives. This year, cooperatives in various areas of Wenling County put forward the slogans "Receive grain whenever it arrives, receive early arrivals early, and receive late arrivals as well" and "Fast grain inspection, fast weighing and ticketing, and fast payment." They rationally adjusted manpower according to the pattern that farmers mostly sell grain before 8:00 a.m. and after 3:00 p.m. Heng and Mushi and other cooperatives also added scales and increased personnel to rush purchases during market days. Some procurement personnel in Yusanmiao, Tangxia, and other cooperatives didn't even have time to wash their faces in the morning and couldn't take time to eat when busy, persisting in procurement work to achieve "receiving grain whenever it arrives." In water-scarce areas, many farmers were carrying out drought resistance work in the fields during the day. Procurement personnel did not refuse to buy grain from farmers who arrived at the cooperatives very late, even if business hours had passed. This year, farmers in Wenling County can complete the procedures in five minutes at the fastest and no more than one hour at the latest when selling rice. The phenomenon of crowding when selling grain in the past has been basically overcome in various places.

This year, cooperatives in various areas of Wenling County also paid special attention to the reception work for farmers selling grain. Ruoheng Cooperative built a large cool shed at the procurement station for farmers to rest; some procurement stations also prepared boiled water and medicine, etc. The farmers selling grain were very satisfied.

The attitude of procurement personnel towards farmers selling grain has also greatly improved. Procurement personnel in Wenxi, Daxi, and other cooperatives paid attention to patiently publicizing and explaining the state's reasonable price policy for purchasing rice to farmers, and soliciting farmers' opinions on the procurement work.

Because cooperatives in various areas of Wenling County improved their working methods and working style, this year's rice procurement volume generally accounts for more than 90 percent of the market volume.

    浙江省温岭县各地合作社
    改进收购工作便利农民卖粮
    浙江省温岭县各地合作社改进收购稻谷的工作方法，有力地推动了收购工作的进行。
    过去，农民嫌到合作社卖粮太麻烦，等的时间太久，说合作社有“三不收”——不到营业时间不收，过了营业时间不收，下雨天不收，因而不大愿意到合作社卖粮。今年，温岭县各地合作社提出了“随到随收，早来早收，晚来也收”和“验谷快，过磅开票快，付款快”的口号。他们根据农民售粮多在上午八点钟以前、下午三点钟以后的规律，合理调整了人力。箬横、牧士等合作社每逢市集，还增添磅秤、增加人员突击收购。雨伞庙、塘下等合作社有些收购人员早上来不及洗脸，忙时顾不上吃饭，坚持收购工作，做到“随到随收”。缺水地区，许多农民白天在田里进行抗旱。很晚才到合作社卖谷，收购人员也不因营业时间已过而加以拒绝。今年温岭县农民出售稻谷，最快的在五分钟内就可以办完手续，最迟也不超过一个钟头；各地已基本上克服了过去售粮时拥挤的现象。
    温岭县各地合作社今年还特别重视对售粮农民的招待工作。箬横合作社在收购站搭了很大的凉棚，供农民休息；有些收购站还备有开水和药水等。售粮农民都很满意。
    收购人员对待卖粮农民的态度也有很大改进。温西、大溪等合作社的收购人员，注意耐心向农民宣传、解释国家收购稻谷的合理的价格政策，并征求农民对收购工作的意见。
    温岭县各地合作社因为改进了工作方法和工作作风，今年稻谷收购量一般占上市量的百分之九十以上。
