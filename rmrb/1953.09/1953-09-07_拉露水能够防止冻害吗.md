    Can Removing Dew Prevent Frost Damage?
    Ren Qixian, Li Fangtian

    On May 7th of this year, the Shanxi Daily published a news item introducing Zhangyu Village in Pinglu County's method of preventing frost: "Using ropes and thin bamboo poles to gently pull across the wheat seedlings, knocking off the dew," stopping immediately when they noticed a thin layer of ice forming on the wheat seedlings. "As a result of their efforts, the entire village's 3,488.5 mu of wheat, after a half-night of struggle, did not suffer from frost damage." The same news item also pointed out that Liu Zan Village used the same method of removing dew, but did so too roughly. When the cadres saw that the ropes were ineffective, they told the masses to use rafters instead, resulting in damage to the wheat seedlings. The news item referred to the cadres working in Zhangyu Village as "technically knowledgeable" cadres, and those working in Liu Zan Village as "technically ignorant" cadres. There is no doubt that the cadres working in Liu Zan Village, lacking technical knowledge, handled the matter poorly. What we question is: Does the method of removing dew to prevent frost in Zhangyu Village have any scientific basis? Can removing the dew from crops prevent them from frost damage?

    We know that the reason crops are damaged and die from frost is mainly because the temperature of the plant body drops below freezing, causing the water within the plant to freeze. When water turns to ice, it expands in volume, disrupting the plant's tissues and altering the relationship between water and fiber within the plant. Even after the ice melts, these damaged and altered components cannot recover, and the plant dies. Crops that are nearly mature, withered, or contain very little moisture are not easily affected by frost. Immature crops that are still growing contain more moisture and are therefore more susceptible to frost damage.

    The presence of dew on crops is entirely different from the water content within the crop's body. Even without dew, the water within the crop's body can freeze, and the crop can still die from frost. In fact, when there is more dew, it is less likely that frost damage will occur. Old farmers have an experience: in late autumn, when the soil has a large base moisture content and there is a lot of dew, they are not afraid of frost. This is in line with scientific principles. Because water contains latent heat, which is released when water freezes. According to experiments, one gram of water freezing into ice can release 80 calories of heat. "Snowing is not cold, melting snow is cold," the reason is here. Gardeners place buckets of water in greenhouses to prevent flowers from freezing, because the heat released when water freezes can prevent the temperature inside the greenhouse from dropping below 0 degrees Celsius. Watering wheat can prevent frost, and is also consistent with this principle. Based on this principle, we believe that dew on crops will not only not aggravate frost damage, but will actually provide some frost protection. The reason why the wheat seedlings in Zhangyu Village were not destroyed by frost may be because the frost was relatively light and did not damage the plant tissue, or because the tissue recovered after the weather warmed up after being slightly frosted; it has nothing to do with "removing dew."

    This opinion is based on general scientific principles. To further prove it, we also plan to conduct experiments with simultaneous, same-location, same-type, and same-size crops when we encounter frost conditions again, removing dew from one plot of crops and leaving it on another to see what happens.

    **Editor's Note:** The opinions of comrades Li Fangtian and Ren Qixian are basically correct. According to physical experiments, one gram of water evaporating into water vapor absorbs about 590 calories of heat; one gram of water freezing into ice releases about 80 calories of heat. From this phenomenon, there may be two kinds of influence to plant when there is dew on the plant: First, the good influence is the latent heat released during the process of dew condensing into frost can insulate the plant. However, this influence is temporary. After the dew has condensed into frost, it will no longer release heat. A thin layer of ice frost covering the plant's branches and leaves cannot isolate it from the cold air outside, and the plant's temperature will still drop along with the outside temperature. Therefore, frost on plant branches and leaves does not play a significant role in preventing frost. However, plants fare much better on nights with dew than during dry freezes, because dew indicates high air humidity, allowing moisture to continue to condense and release heat; at the same time, it can prevent moisture evaporation. Second, the bad influence is dew absorbs heat when it evaporates, which will lower the plant's temperature. However, if the air temperature continues to drop when dew is observed, and the humidity of the air close to the plant is already saturated, and water vapor is continuing to condense into frost, there will be no strong evaporation phenomenon, and the bad influence is not significant. From these principles, the dew on crops is not very important to whether the crops are frostbitten. The method of removing dew cannot play any role in preventing frost; on the other hand, the ropes and sticks used when removing dew can easily damage the crops. This method should not be promoted. At present, the more practical and effective frost prevention method in rural areas is still the smoke method. In areas with water conservancy conditions, watering before frost damage occurs is also a frost prevention method. For how to use the smoke method to prevent frost, please refer to the article "Smoking is an Effective Method to Protect Plants from Frost Damage" on this page of today's newspaper. In addition, the articles "How to Prevent Frost Damage" on the second page of this newspaper on October 16, 1952, and "Shanxi Farmers Fight Against Frost Damage and Achieve Victory" on the second page of June 9, 1953, provide detailed descriptions of using the smoke method to prevent frost.

    拉露水能够防止冻害吗
    任启贤  李方田
    今年五月七日山西日报登载了一段消息，介绍平陆县张峪村防止霜冻的办法是：“用绳和细竹杆挨住麦苗轻轻拉过，把露水打下”，至发现麦苗上结了薄冰的时候，就立即停止。“他们这样做的结果，全村三千四百八十八亩半麦子，经过半夜的斗争，未受到冻灾的损失。”在同一条消息里，又指出刘赞村也是用的拉露水的方法，但是拉得太粗暴，干部见群众用绳拉不见效就叫群众用椽子拉，结果把麦苗都拉坏了。消息中把在张峪村工作的干部叫做“懂技术”的干部，把在刘赞村工作的干部叫做“不懂技术”的干部。在刘赞村工作的干部不懂技术，把事情办坏了，这是没有疑问的。我们怀疑的是：张峪村的拉露水防冻的办法究竟有什么科学根据呢？拉掉庄稼上的露水就能使庄稼不受霜害么？
    我们知道，农作物受冻而枯死的原因，主要是植物体温降低到冰点以下，作物体内的水分结了冰；在水变冰的时候，体积膨胀，破坏了植物的组织，变化了植物体内水分和纤维组织的关系；即使冰消以后，这些破坏了、变化了的东西也不能复原，植物就枯死了。将近成熟的、枯老的或含水分极少的作物，是不易受冻的。未成熟的还在生长的作物体内含有比较多的水分，所以易受霜冻的影响。
    作物上带有露水，和作物机体内含有水分，是完全不同的。没有露水时，作物机体内的水分也会结冰，作物也会冻死。露水多时，倒是比较不容易发生冻害。老农有一条经验：秋末底墒大、露水多的时候，就不怕霜冻。这是合乎科学道理的。因为水里是含有潜热的，在水结冰的时候，潜热就要散发出来。据实验，一克（公分）重的水结成冰，可以放出八十卡（热量单位）热量。“下雪不冷消雪冷”，道理就在这里。园艺工人把水桶放在花房里，可以防止花卉受冻；也因为水结冰时所散发出来的热可以使花房里的温度不致下降到摄氏零度以下。浇麦可以防止霜冻，也是合乎这个道理的。根据这个道理，我们认为，作物上的露水不但不会加重冻灾，反而多少会起一些防冻的作用的。张峪村的麦苗没有冻毁，恐怕是因为当地冻得比较轻没有伤害麦苗的组织机能，或是稍微受冻在天暖后组织机能又恢复了；和“打露水”是没有什么关系的。
    这个意见是根据一般科学的道理的，为了进一步证明它，我们还准备再遇到霜冻情况的时候，以同时、同地、同类、同大的作物分别实验一下，一块庄稼打掉露水，一块不打，看到底怎样。
    编者按：李方田、任启贤两同志的意见基本上是正确的。根据物理实验，一克水蒸发变成水蒸汽，要吸收五九零卡左右的热量；一克水冻结成冰，可以放出八十卡左右的热量。从这现象来看，植物上有露水的时候，对于植物可能有两种影响：一、好的影响是露水在结霜的过程放出潜热，对植物可以起保温作用。可是，这种影响是暂时的。露水已经凝结成霜以后，就再也不会放出热量了。植物的枝叶盖上很薄一层冰霜，并不能与外间的冷空气隔绝，植物体的温度仍然会跟着外间的温度一起下降。因此，植物枝叶上有霜对于防冻不会起多大作用。不过，植物在有露水的夜里，却比干冻要好得多，这是因为有露水就表现空气的湿度大，水分可以继续不断凝结，放出热量；同时，可以防止水分的蒸发。二、坏的影响是露水蒸发的时候要吸热，会降低植物体温。不过，发现露水时如果空气温度在继续降低，接近植物的空气的湿度已在饱和状态，水汽正在继续凝结成霜，就不会有强烈的蒸发现象，坏的影响也不大。从这些道理来看，作物上的露水，对作物的是否受冻关系都不怎么重要。打露水的办法，不能对防霜防冻起什么作用；另一方面，打露水时所用绳子棍棒，却很容易使作物受到损伤。这种办法是不应当提倡的。目前农村比较实际有效的防冻方法还只有熏烟法。有水利条件的地区，在发生冻害前浇水也是一种防冻的办法。怎样用熏烟法来预防霜冻，请参阅今日本报本版“熏烟是使植物免受冻害的有效方法”一文。此外，本报一九五二年十月十六日第二版“怎样预防霜害”一文和一九五三年六月九日第二版“山西农民与冻害作斗争取得胜利”的报道，对用熏烟法预防霜冻都有详细叙述。
