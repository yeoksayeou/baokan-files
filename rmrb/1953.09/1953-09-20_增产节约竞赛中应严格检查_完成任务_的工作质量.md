    In the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign, Strictly Check the Work Quality of “Completing Tasks”
    Reader Wang Fu's letter: On the afternoon of July 20th, the leading cadres of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory held a meeting to review the implementation of the factory's freight car workshop's production, technical, and financial plans for June. At the meeting, the director of the freight car workshop reported on their completion of the plan for June: the output plan was completed by 101.3%; the output value plan was completed by 103.6%; the cost plan was reduced by 4%; 310 million yuan was saved; and accidents were reduced by two compared to the previous month...

    Judging from the figures in this report, the results seem to be very good; but after everyone's in-depth analysis, the actual situation was not like this.

    Although the output and output value plans of the freight car workshop were completed in June, the situation of being loose in the beginning and tight at the end, and uneven production was very serious. 56% of the monthly plan was completed in the last ten days, and 20% was only completed on the last day. The "magic weapon" for completing the plan was overtime blitz, with a total of 440 hours of overtime for the entire month. Whenever a job needed a blitz, personnel were transferred there, and some workers were transferred to seven different positions in one day.

    Although costs were reduced, the quality of the products was poor. If there were holes in the car boxes, they were not repaired properly but smeared with putty and left at that. Cost calculations were inaccurate, and the unit cost of the same repair cycle sometimes differed by a factor of six.

    Let's examine the "savings" performance. Although tool repair costs were saved, the cost of newly purchased tools was much higher; instead of repairing old tools when they broke, new ones were purchased. 2 million yuan under the rationalization proposal item was also saved. Conversely, oxygen was wasted in large quantities, and a little saving could save 100 million yuan every year.

    Accidents were reduced by two compared to the previous month. However, 60% of the accident responsibility lay with the leading cadres of the workshop, due to their incorrect guidance.

    After everyone's analysis at the meeting, the true situation of the workshop's work became clear: there was progress compared to the previous situation where the monthly plan could not be completed; but there were still many shortcomings that needed to be overcome. This meeting not only effectively helped the freight car workshop improve its future work, but also provided a great education for the cadres of the entire factory.

    In the first year of the first five-year plan, these kinds of shortcomings that occurred in the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory's freight car workshop when completing the plan are not isolated; and the situation where these shortcomings are hidden behind the "achievements" in the reports is also not isolated. However, at present, some factory and mine leading cadres only look at reports and forms in the office without deeply understanding and analyzing the actual situation, and are only satisfied with the figures of completing the plan without strictly reviewing the quality of completing the plan. It is obviously not possible to lead production in this way. For them, the method of Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory in reviewing the implementation of the freight car workshop's plan is worth learning well.

### 增产节约竞赛中应严格检查“完成任务”的工作质量

    增产节约竞赛中应严格检查“完成任务”的工作质量
    读者王弗来信：七月二十日下午，长辛店机车车辆修理工厂的领导干部开会审查该厂货车车间六月份生产、技术和财务计划的执行情况。会上，货车车间主任报告了他们六月份完成计划的情况：产量计划完成百分之一百零一点三；产值计划完成百分之一百零三点六；成本计划降低百分之四；节约了三亿一千万元；事故比上月减少两件……。
    从这个报告中的数字看来，成绩似乎很不错；但经过大家深入分析，实际情况并不是这样。
    货车车间六月份的产量和产值计划虽然是完成了，但前松后紧、生产不均衡的情况十分严重，月计划的百分之五十六是下旬完成的，百分之二十是最后一天才完成的。而完成计划的“法宝”是加班突击，全月加班达四百四十小时。那里的活要突击，就往那里调兵遣将，有的工人一天竟连续调换过七个工作岗位。
    成本虽然降低了，但产品质量低劣。车箱上有破洞不认真修理，用油泥一抹了事。成本计算不准确，同样修程的车，单位成本有时竟差六倍。
    再检查一下“节约”成绩吧，工具修理费虽然节约了，但新购置的工具费用超过很多；原来旧工具坏了不修理就另买新的了。合理化建议项下的二百万元也节约下来了。相反，氧气被大量地浪费着，稍加节约每年就可省下一亿元。
    事故是比上月减少了两件。但有百分之六十的事故责任在于车间的领导干部，是由于他们的错误指导而造成的。
    经过大家在会上的分析，这个车间工作的真实情况就很明显了：比起过去每月完不成计划的情况来是有进步的；但是还有不少缺点需要继续努力克服。这次会议不但有效地帮助货车车间提高今后的工作，而且对全厂干部也是一个很大的教育。
    在第一个五年计划的头一个年度中，像长辛店机车车辆修理工厂货车车间完成计划时所发生的这类缺点并不是个别的；而这些缺点在报告中隐藏在“成绩”后面的情况也不是个别的。但是，目前还有些厂矿领导干部，只在办公室里看报告、表格而不深入了解和分析实际情况，只满足于完成计划的数字而不严格审查完成计划的质量。这样来领导生产显然是不行的。对于他们来说，长辛店机车车辆修理工厂审查货车车间执行计划情况的方法是值得很好地学习的。
