Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 15th:

DPRK Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Li Dongjian cabled UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on the 14th, replying to the UN General Assembly's notification to the DPRK government on August 28 regarding the decision on the political conference. The full text of the reply is as follows:

Mr. Secretary-General Hammarskjöld,

The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has received notification of the decision made by the United Nations General Assembly on August 28 this year regarding the political conference recommended by the Korean Armistice Agreement. To this end, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea hereby authorizes me to make the following reply.

The UN General Assembly's decision on the composition of the political conference cannot meet the purpose of the political conference, which must make practical contributions to the peaceful settlement of the Korean question, and further to the consolidation of peace in Asia and the world, and international security. Regarding the composition of the political conference, the aforementioned basic decision of the UN General Assembly is: only countries with their own troops participating in the Korean War, as belligerent parties, can participate in the political conference.

However, the conditions of Article 60 of the Armistice Agreement do not mean that only countries that participated in the Korean War with their own armed forces can participate in the political conference, and that neutral countries cannot participate in this conference.

According to the provisions of Article 60 of the Korean Armistice Agreement, the representatives designated by both parties shall participate in the political conference, first to negotiate the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful settlement of the Korean question, and then to negotiate other issues. The political conference should not only discuss the issue of establishing true peace in Korea as described above, but also discuss important issues that have a huge impact on peace in Asia and the world. Since the task of the political conference is completely different from the purely military task of the armistice negotiations, the participation of non-belligerent countries, especially some neutral countries that have a close relationship with the settlement of the Korean question and the consolidation of peace in Asia, in the political conference has a huge positive significance for making solutions acceptable to both parties. This is an undeniable and obvious fact. The UN General Assembly's decision on the composition of the political conference, which ignores this obvious fact, contains contradictions in itself.

I believe that it is appropriate for the UN General Assembly to pass another resolution allowing recognized neutral countries like the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to participate in the political conference, so that all neutral countries can participate in the political conference.

However, disregarding the special concern of other Asian neutral countries for the Korean political conference, the UN General Assembly's decision does not want an Asian neutral country to participate in the political conference. This decision even excludes India, and in the Political Committee of the UN General Assembly, the absolute majority of member states, including Asian, Arab and European countries, except for the United States and some of its servant countries, voted in favor of India's participation in the political conference and passed the resolution.

The UN General Assembly's above decision on the composition of the political conference is not appropriate for ensuring the effective completion of the important tasks undertaken by the political conference. This is a very obvious fact.

1. The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea believes that this decision of the UN General Assembly cannot be adopted as the basis for holding the political conference. I now reiterate that the political conference must solve the problems before it in the form of a round table conference, with the participation of neutral countries that are directly concerned with the peaceful settlement of the Korean question and the consolidation of peace in Asia, according to the claims that have been clearly put forward by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Central People's Government. At the same time, the political conference must be the first step in setting an example for the peaceful resolution of international disputes.

2. The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea welcomes the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, which has always been consistently striving for a fair resolution of the Korean question through peaceful means, to participate in the political conference as a neutral country with an inseparable and close relationship with the peaceful settlement of the Korean question and the consolidation of peace in Asia. It also believes that, in order to successfully conduct the work of the political conference, the political conference must allow Asian neutral countries that are directly concerned with the solution of the Korean question and the consolidation of peace in Asia to participate in the political conference. In particular, it is necessary to allow India, which has contributed a lot to reaching a Korean armistice and can provide practical assistance in resolving issues related to the consolidation of peace in Asia, to participate.

3. It must be solemnly pointed out that the inappropriateness of the above-mentioned UN General Assembly decision and the contradictions it contains are obviously related to the fact that the possibility of representatives from the DPRK and the PRC participating in the UN General Assembly to discuss the Korean issue is still being denied. Moreover, the issue of the composition of the political conference cannot be resolved by one party alone, but must be resolved based on the agreement of both parties.

4. The Government of the DPRK believes that the 8th UN General Assembly has great positive significance for allowing neutral countries to participate in the political conference, and believes that it is necessary to correct the huge shortcomings of the above-mentioned decision of the UN General Assembly on the political conference issue, and take the necessary measures to expand the composition of the political conference.

In this regard, the Government of the DPRK fully agrees with and supports the suggestions put forward by Mr. Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, in his reply to the Secretary-General of the UN General Assembly on September 13, 1953, regarding the resolution on the Korean question at the 430th plenary meeting of the UN General Assembly, and suggests the following:

A. The member states participating in the political conference must include all countries on both sides of the Korean War. Neutral countries of particular concern, including the Union of Soviet Socialist republics, India, Indonesia, Pakistan and Burma, must be invited.

B. The political conference must take the form of a round table conference, but any decision of the political conference must be unanimously agreed by both sides of the Korean War.

C. In order to satisfactorily resolve the issue of the political conference, the 8th UN General Assembly must invite representatives from the Government of the DPRK and the Central People's Government of the PRC to participate in the conference for joint consultation when discussing the issue of expanding the composition of the political conference.

D. After the issue of the composition of the political conference has been resolved through consultation, the belligerent parties of the Korean War should promptly negotiate and prepare for the location and time of the political conference.

5. I request that the full text of this reply be distributed to all member states attending the 8th UN General Assembly and that it be included in the agenda of the 8th UN General Assembly.

6. The Government of the DPRK awaits a reply from the 8th UN General Assembly.

Li Dongjian, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of the DPRK
Pyongyang, September 14, 1953

    朝鲜外务省副相李东建电联合国秘书长
    复联大关于政治会议决议的通知
    【新华社平壤十五日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务省副相李东建在十四日复电联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，回答联合国大会在八月二十八日给朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的关于政治会议决定的通知。复电全文如下：联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德先生
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府已经收到了关于联合国大会在今年八月二十八日就朝鲜停战协定建议召开的政治会议所作决定的通知。为此，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府特授权本人，作如下的回答。
    联合国大会关于政治会议组成的决定，不能适应政治会议的目的，这个会议必须对朝鲜问题的和平解决，并进而对亚洲与世界和平及国际安全的巩固作出实际的贡献。关于政治会议的组成，上述的联合国大会的基本决定是：只有有自己的军队参加朝鲜战争的国家，作为交战双方，才能参加政治会议。
    但是停战协定第六十款的条件绝不是意味着：只有以自己的武装力量参加朝鲜战争的国家才能参加政治会议，而中立国家不能参加这个会议。
    根据朝鲜停战协定第六十款的规定，由双方指定的代表参加政治会议，首先协商从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队及和平解决朝鲜问题，然后再协商其他问题。政治会议不只要讨论如上所述的确立朝鲜真正和平的问题，同时还要讨论对亚洲及全世界的和平有巨大影响的重要问题。由于政治会议的任务与属于单纯军事性的停战谈判任务完全不同，非交战国家，特别是对朝鲜问题的解决和巩固亚洲和平有着密切关系的几个中立国家参加政治会议，对于作出双方能够接受的解决有着巨大的肯定意义，这是不可否认的明显事实。无视这种明白事实的关于政治会议组成的联合国大会的决定，其本身便包含着矛盾。
    我认为：联合国大会通过让如同苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟一样被公认的中立国参加政治会议的又一个决定，以便让各中立国参加政治会议，是适当的。
    可是，不顾其他亚洲中立国对朝鲜政治会议所具有的特别关心，联合国大会的决定竟不要亚洲的一个中立国参加政治会议。这个决定甚至是排除印度的，而在联合国大会政治委员会上，除了美国及其一些仆从国家而外，包括了亚洲、阿拉伯国家及欧洲国家的绝对大部分的大多数会员国家，都曾投票赞成并通过印度参加政治会议。
    联合国大会关于政治会议组成的如上决定，对于保证有效地完成政治会议所担负的重要任务，是不适当的。这是很明显的事实。
    一、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府认为：联合国大会的这个决定不能被采用为举行政治会议的基础，我现在再一次声明：政治会议必须根据朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和中华人民共和国中央人民政府业已明确提出的主张，即在直接关心和平解决朝鲜问题和巩固亚洲和平的中立国的参加下，采取圆桌会议的形式，解决在它面前所提出的问题，同时必须使政治会议成为和平解决国际争端的模范的第一步。
    二、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府欢迎为了以和平的方法公正地解决朝鲜问题而始终一贯努力的苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟，作为对和平解决朝鲜问题和巩固亚洲和平具有不可分的密切关系的中立国，参加政治会议，并且认为：为了胜利地进行政治会议的工作，政治会议必须使直接关心朝鲜问题的解决与巩固亚洲和平的亚洲中立国家参加政治会议。尤其是使在达成朝鲜停战上尽了不少力量和对解决有关巩固亚洲和平问题可以给予实际援助的印度参加，是必要的。
    三、必须郑重指出：上述联合国大会决定的不适当性和它所包含着的矛盾，很明显是与朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国代表参加联合国大会讨论朝鲜问题的可能性仍然被剥夺的事实相联系的。并且，关于政治会议组成的问题，只由一方是解决不了的，而必须是根据双方的协议，才能得到解决。
    四、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府认为，第八届联合国大会对于让中立国家参加政治会议有着重大的肯定意义，并且认为有必要纠正联合国大会关于政治会议问题的上述决定具有的巨大的缺点，而采取为扩大政治会议组成所需的措施。
    对此，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府完全赞同和支持中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部部长周恩来先生就联合国大会第四三零次全体会议关于朝鲜问题的决议案在一九五三年九月十三日给联合国大会秘书长的答复中所提出的建议，并建议如下：
    甲、参加政治会议的成员国家必须包括朝鲜战争交战双方的所有国家。特别关心的中立国家，包括苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟、印度、印度尼西亚、巴基斯坦和缅甸必须被邀请。
    乙、政治会议必须采取圆桌会议的形式，但政治会议的任何决定，必须获得朝鲜战争交战双方的一致同意。
    丙、为了圆满地解决政治会议问题，第八届联合国大会必须在讨论扩大政治会议的组成问题时，邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和中华人民共和国中央人民政府的代表参加大会，共同进行协商。
    丁、在协商解决了政治会议的组成问题以后，朝鲜战争的交战双方应及时对政治会议的地点和时间问题，进行协商和准备。
    五、我要求把这个复电的全文分发给出席第八届联合国大会的全体会员国，并把它包括在第八届联合国大会的议程中。
    六、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府等待第八届联合国大会的答复。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务省副相李东建
    一九五三年九月十四日平壤市
