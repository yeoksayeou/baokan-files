The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government has issued a notice to all regions to temporarily suspend the promotion of the "666" powder seed mixing method for preventing mole crickets and wireworms. The notice states: Our ministry previously proposed a method for preventing mole crickets and wireworms and notified all regions to implement it (see page 2 of this newspaper, September 3rd). However, based on the current situation, the use of "666" powder-treated grain or arsenic-treated grain for control should be adopted, as this method is relatively safe and effective. As for the "666" powder seed mixing method, because the technology is not easily mastered by the masses, to avoid losses, it may be temporarily suspended from promotion. It should first be tested and demonstrated by farms, and after successful experience is gained, it can then be gradually promoted with a focus.

    防治蝼蛄、金针虫的办法
    中央人民政府农业部通知各地暂不推广“六六六”粉拌种防治蝼蛄、金针虫的办法。通知中说：我部曾提出防治蝼蛄、金针虫的办法，通知各地防治。（见本报九月三日二版）。但根据目前情况，应采用“六六六”粉制毒谷或砒制毒谷防治，此法比较安全有效。至于“六六六”粉拌种方法，因技术不易使群众掌握，为了避免损失，可暂不推广。应先由农场进行试验示范，取得成功经验后，再有重点逐步推广。
