Xinhua News Agency, August 8th: TASS Moscow, September 7th: "Pravda" published a dispatch from Pyongyang by Khokhlov, describing the reconstruction work in Pyongyang.

Khokhlov wrote: It has only been a month since the armistice was realized, but much reconstruction work has already been carried out in Pyongyang.

Before the American invasion war, Pyongyang had a population of 500,000 and more than 33,000 state-owned and private houses. Due to the barbaric bombing by the United States, not a single house remains intact.

The residents of Pyongyang love their hometown not only because it is the oldest and most beautiful city in Korea, but also because it symbolizes the victory of the new democratic system established in northern Korea after the Soviet army liberated Korea. The residents of Pyongyang, in the war of the Korean people resisting the aggression of American imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique, proved that they were loyal children of the motherland, capable of clearing all obstacles on the road to victory.

During the war, the hardworking people of Pyongyang quickly restored what the enemy had destroyed. Trains and trucks loaded with goods passed through Pyongyang, ensuring that the front and the rear received all the materials necessary for victory. Under the call of the Labor Party and the government, the industrial workers and staff members of Pyongyang moved more than 40 factories underground in a very short time, allowing the factories to continue operating. All the residents vigorously built underground residences dozens of meters deep, where more than 250,000 people lived.

The residents of this heroic city, who were models of selfless service to the motherland during the war, are today the vanguard in the reconstruction work that has been launched throughout the country. The residents of Pyongyang enthusiastically responded to the government's decision to restore and rebuild the democratic capital.

Khokhlov wrote: There is a saying that the capital can reflect the situation of the entire country and make people understand the characteristics and style of the country. The entire life of Pyongyang is filled with the enthusiasm of construction, vividly reflecting the current situation in every corner of heroic Korea. The term "underground city" used by the people of Pyongyang is a thing of the past, and groups of construction workers are building more and more houses and other buildings on the ground. A theater is being built on Moranbong in Pyongyang, an iron bridge is being built over the Taedong River, and the construction of a textile factory is also in full swing.

Xinhua News Agency, July 7th: TASS Pyongyang: Wonsan, the heroic city of Korea, which was damaged in the war, is being restored.

The Korean Central News Agency reported: The restored Wonsan Brick Factory is supplying building products. Restoration work has begun on the textile factory and food complex. Residents of Wonsan are carrying out the restoration of the Municipal Central Hospital building. Tap water in the city has been repaired. Electrical workers are repairing the power grid, and electricity can be supplied to enterprises in a few days, and the street lights in the houses can be re-lit.

Xinhua News Agency, August 8th: TASS Pyongyang: The miners of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are working selflessly in the work of restoring the national economy.

By adopting the advanced working methods of Soviet miners, and demonstrating creativity and tenacity in their work, Korean miners are constantly increasing mineral production. Labor Hero Kim Chon-sun (transliteration) is at the forefront of Korean miners. According to "Democratic Korea," Kim Chon-sun completed 120 percent of his annual plan as early as June 5th because he adopted the parallel drilling method, and is currently striving to overfulfill another annual plan in the next few months of the second half of the year. As a result of Kim Chon-sun's teaching his working methods to other miners, all the drilling workers in his mine can now complete at least 200 percent of the quota. All the workers of a certain mine in Jagang Province have achieved great achievements, and miners Kim Young-kyung (transliteration) and Han Chun-soon (transliteration) have completed their annual plans. Drilling worker Ok Ryeon-deok (transliteration) completes the task more than double every day.

The number of advanced enterprises in the national mining industry is increasing day by day. According to the Korean Central News Agency, the workers, engineers and technicians of a mine led by Kim Baek-yong (transliteration) have completed the annual plan of the enterprise.

    平壤、元山居民努力进行恢复工作
    朝鲜许多矿工提前完成全年生产计划
    【新华社八日讯】塔斯社莫斯科七日讯：“真理报”登载霍赫洛夫写的一篇平壤通讯，叙述了平壤进行恢复工作的情形。
    霍赫洛夫写道：停战实现以来，到现在只不过一个月，但是平壤已经进行了许多恢复工作。
    在美国发动侵朝战争以前，平壤居民有五十万人，有三万三千幢以上国有的和私人的住宅。由于美国的野蛮轰炸，已经没有一座房子是完整的。
    平壤居民之所以热爱家乡，不仅是由于平壤是朝鲜最古老和最美好的城市。而是因为平壤象征着苏军解放朝鲜以后在朝鲜北部建立起来的新的、民主制度的胜利。平壤居民在朝鲜人民抵抗美帝国主义及李承晚匪帮侵略的战争中，证明他们是祖国忠实的儿女，能够在走向胜利的道路上扫清一切障碍。
    在战争期间，勤劳的平壤人民迅速地把敌人毁坏的东西恢复起来。一列一列满载货物的火车和卡车驶过平壤，保证了前线和后方得到取得胜利所必需的一切物资。在劳动党和政府的号召下，平壤的产业工人们和机关工作人员们在一个很短的时间内把四十几个工厂迁到地下，使工厂继续开工。全体居民生气勃勃地在几十公尺深的地下建造了地下住宅，有二十五万以上的人民就住在这些地下住宅里。
    这个英勇的城市的居民，在战时是忘我地为祖国服务的模范，今天是已在全国展开的复兴工作中的先锋。平壤居民满怀热忱地响应了政府关于恢复和重建民主首都的决定。
    霍赫洛夫写道：有句话说：首都可以反映整个国家的情况和使人们了解这个国家的特色和风格。平壤的全部生命都充满了建设的热情，生动地反映出在英勇的朝鲜的各个角落中当前的情景。平壤人民所说的“地下城”这个名词已成过去了，一群群建筑工人正在地面上建造起愈来愈多的住宅和其他的建筑物。平壤的牡丹峰上正在建造一所戏院，大同江上正在建造一座铁桥，一座纺织工厂的建筑工程也正在紧张进行中。
    【新华社七日讯】塔斯社平壤讯：在战争中受到破坏的朝鲜英雄城市——元山，正在恢复中。
    朝鲜中央通讯社报道：恢复了的元山制砖工厂正在供应建筑产品。纺织工厂和食品联合工厂的恢复工作已经开始。元山居民正在进行市立中央医院大厦的恢复工作。市内的自来水已经修复。电气工人正在修复电线网，几天后就可以向企业输送电力，居房和街道的电灯也可以重新亮起来。
    【新华社八日讯】塔斯社平壤讯：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的矿工们，正在恢复国民经济的工作中进行忘我的劳动。
    由于采用了苏联矿工的先进工作法，以及在工作中表现了创造精神和顽强的精神，朝鲜的矿工正在不断地提高矿产开采量。劳动英雄金川顺（译音）走在朝鲜矿工的最前列。据“民主朝鲜”报道：金川顺因为采用了平行钻探法，早在六月五日就完成了全年计划的百分之一百二十，目前正为在下半年的几个月中再超额完成一个全年计划而斗争。由于金川顺把自己的工作法传授给其他矿工，结果，他那个矿山里的全体钻探工人目前至少可完成定额的百分之二百。慈江道某矿山的全体工人取得了巨大的成就，矿工金荣庆（译音）和韩春顺（译音）已经完成了全年的计划。钻探工人玉连德（译音）每天超额一倍完成任务。
    全国采矿业中的先进企业的数目日益增加，据朝鲜中央通讯社报道：金白溶（译音）领导的一个矿山的工人、工程师和技术人员，已经完成了该企业的全年计划。
