Xinhua News Agency, September 15th: According to Vietnam News Agency, local units of the Vietnamese People's Army continue to launch successful attacks in various parts of the Red River Delta. In order to continue to strike at the enemy forces conducting mopping-up operations in the southern part of Nam Dinh Province, the People's Army raided two enemy strongholds in Nghia Hung County on the evening of August 21, capturing 132 Bao Dai puppet soldiers and seizing a large amount of military supplies. Subsequently, the People's Army destroyed two enemy strongholds in Tien Yen County, Hai Ninh Province, killing or capturing two entire platoons of enemy soldiers; and destroyed seven enemy trucks on Highway No. 1 in Ha Nam Province.

    In order to disrupt the Northwest region, the French colonialists dropped a batch of armed bandits over various locations in Muong Te County on August 10. These bandits were immediately subjected to a joint search and capture by the local military and civilians after landing. In three days, the military and civilians of Muong Te County have captured nine paratrooper bandits and seized the weapons they carried.
    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, September 14th, TASS: "l'Humanité" commented on the US National Security Council's decision to support the Indochina War with 385 million US dollars in US "aid," and on the arrival of US Senator Knowland in Saigon, saying: "The US Senate instructed him (referring to Knowland - editor's note) to check how the dollars are being spent, and to investigate the military situation and the plans of the expeditionary force, in order to understand whether these dollars are being used properly, and when Lanier assures Dulles that the nine French battalions can be sent."

    "l'Humanité" also exposed the long-term conspiracy of the US government in Southeast Asia. The newspaper said: While American capitalists are gradually seizing the position of French capitalists, American military and political leaders specializing in Far Eastern affairs are trying to establish an organization of Southeast Asian countries directly under the control of the US State Department. Recently, it has become known that the Pentagon held a series of meetings in early August, with Admiral Radford, General Clark and Dulles participating. At these meetings, it was decided to make every effort to accelerate the establishment of a "league" of Southeast Asian governments including Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand and Malaya. General Donovan, former head of the US Office of Strategic Services, was appointed as the US Ambassador to Bangkok in order to realize this plan.

    越南人民军继续在红河三角洲进攻法军
    法国“人道报”揭露美国政府侵略东南亚的阴谋
    【新华社十五日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南人民军地方部队继续在红河三角洲各地出击获胜。人民军为了继续打击在南定省南部进行扫荡的敌军，曾在八月二十一日晚突袭义兴县的两个敌军据点，俘掳保大伪军一百三十二名，缴获大量军用物资。接着，人民军又在海宁省先安县摧毁敌军据点两处，毙俘敌军两个整排；在河南省的第一号公路上击毁敌军卡车七辆。
    法国殖民者为了扰乱西北地区，曾于八月十日在木州县各地上空投下一批武装匪徒，这些匪徒在着陆后立即遭到当地军民的合力搜捕。在三天中，木州军民已捕获了九名空降匪徒，并缴获了他们携带的武器。
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社巴黎十四日讯：“人道报”评论美国国家安全委员会决定以三亿八千五百万美元的美“援”支持印度支那战争、及美国参议员诺兰到达西贡一事说：“美国参议院训令他（指诺兰——编者注）去检查美元是怎样花掉的，并要他调查军事形势和远征军的计划，以便了解这些美元用的是否得当，拉尼埃向杜勒斯保证派出的九个法国营何时可以派出。”
    “人道报”并揭露了美国政府在东南亚的长远阴谋。该报说：当美国资本家正在逐渐夺取了法国资本家的地位时，专门研究远东问题的美国军政领袖们正在竭力建立一个直接听命于美国国务院的东南亚国家的组织。最近大家知道，五角大楼在八月初举行了一系列的会议，有雷德福上将、克拉克将军和杜勒斯参加。在这些会议上决定尽一切努力加速成立包括寮国、高棉、越南、泰国和马来亚在内的东南亚各国政府的“联盟”。前美国战略服务处处长杜诺万将军被任命为美国驻曼谷大使，就是为了实现这一计划。
