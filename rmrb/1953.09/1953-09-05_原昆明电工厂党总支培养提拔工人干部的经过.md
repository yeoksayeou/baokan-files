    The Process of Cultivating and Promoting Worker Cadres by the Former Kunming Electric Factory Party Branch
    Li Yun
    With the development of national economic construction, a huge number of cadres are needed to undertake various tasks; earnestly promoting and cultivating active elements among workers is the main source of cadres. From the early days of liberation to April of this year, the former Kunming Electric Factory, divided into smelting and electrical engineering plants, promoted a group of worker cadres through various movements. These worker cadres are mostly active and responsible, hardworking and dedicated, obedient to leadership, deeply involved in practice, and have close ties with the masses; they can also strive to learn politics and culture, are receptive to new things, can delve into their work, overcome difficulties, have confidence in their work, and progress quickly. When worker cadres are first promoted, they have ideological concerns. For example, they worry that their education is low and their abilities are poor, and they fear that they will mess up the work. In actual work, because they lack work experience, lack planning, and do not know how to grasp the key points, they do whatever they see, and their work seems disorganized.
    However, the factory's Party committee had anticipated this situation and took the initiative to provide assistance in light of the actual situation, resolving their ideological and work-related difficulties. It told everyone to be bold and let go of their work, and that with the leadership of the Party and by relying on the masses, they could overcome difficulties. If the work was done wrong, the leadership first reviewed its own responsibilities and encouraged them to continue their efforts. At the same time, worker cadre symposiums were held once a week to exchange problems and experiences in the work, and to study ways to overcome difficulties. Based on the issues raised by them, the leadership mobilized everyone to discuss and study, helping to summarize and improve, and providing specific solutions. At the first symposium, the leading cadres first boosted everyone's confidence and courage; and told them some working methods, proposing three points for everyone to implement: first, to have ambition, confidence and a spirit of learning; second, to establish a style of hard work and plain living; third, not to forget one's roots and always maintain contact with the masses. After several symposiums, everyone learned some working methods, and their work ability also improved, and those who had been shaken began to stabilize. Later, in order to obtain mass supervision, worker representatives from various workshops were also absorbed to participate in the symposium; most of them were able to bring up the opinions of the masses below, which made the worker cadres realize the importance of the mass line and cultivated the ideological style of criticism and self-criticism. In addition to symposiums, there were also two briefing meetings every week to help solve problems in the work in a timely manner, and to call on each department to study their own work. It was also emphasized that new cadres could talk to the leading cadres individually at any time to seek leadership help. When the higher Party committee and administrative departments held training courses or convened professional meetings, the factory Party committee and administrative leaders tried their best to let the worker cadres participate, to help them improve their political and professional level and consolidate their confidence in their work.
    Through the worker cadre symposium, the factory's Party branch consciously helped solve the problems raised by the new cadres to improve their work ability. This work lasted for four months and was very effective. Comrade Dong Fusheng, the newly promoted deputy director, said: "Four months of education has laid the foundation for cadres to learn and improve, and become a condition for continued progress in the future." However, after the shift from political reform to production and construction, due to heavy production tasks, one-stop symposiums could no longer solve the problems existing in the production work; therefore, the Party branch changed the method of holding symposiums once a week and suggested that the administrative meeting strengthen the education of new cadres. The administrative meeting was held once a week, and the leading cadres listened to the reports, praised the achievements, summarized the experience, studied the difficulties, and put forward solutions. The number of people participating in the meeting was smaller than that of the symposium, and the problems were solved more centrally, which played a certain role in helping the cadres. Generally, each department established a department affairs meeting system. With the process of going deep into production and into the workshops, the chaotic phenomena in the work were gradually overcome. At the same time, although the production tasks were heavy and the work was busy, as long as there were opportunities for meetings and learning, the leading cadres still let the cadres participate. For example, after He Hui, the chief of the finance section, returned to the factory after attending meetings in Kunming and Beijing, his political consciousness and professional knowledge were quickly improved. Some cadres were sent by the Party branch to the worker cadre training class held by the Municipal Party Committee to study, examine and criticize their own thoughts and work style. After returning to the factory, they showed stability, humility, and overcame arrogance and impatience, and their work was greatly improved.
    Because some education and improvement work had been carried out when the worker cadres were promoted, such as symposiums, briefing meetings, individual talks, absorbing the masses to participate in meetings to make suggestions, etc., the general new cadres had a clearer view of relying on the masses, believed that it was easy to overcome difficulties by finding the masses, and were willing to be students of the masses. This foundation was relatively solid and played a great role in the growth of worker cadres. This is also an important part of the factory's Party committee's education of worker cadres. For example, Comrade He Hui was able to take the lead in reviewing his shortcomings at the department affairs meeting and mobilize everyone to make suggestions to him. In this way, the work was improved and subjectivism was overcome. He also often took the initiative to talk to staff and veteran technicians, went deep into the workshop to understand the situation, and discovered problems. Therefore, his business progressed quickly, and he was more competent and happy in his position as chief of the finance section, and he was able to find ways to overcome difficulties. For example, Wu Xian, the current chief of the supply and marketing section of the Electric Factory, has a clear understanding of the warehouse inventory, can contact workshop cadres and the masses, understand the production progress of the workshop, and formulate a procurement plan, which has changed the passive and chaotic situation of supply and marketing work; in June, there was no work stoppage due to waiting for materials, and the phenomenon of inventory backlog gradually decreased.
    At the same time, the factory's Party committee also paid attention to educating and helping worker cadres learn leadership methods. Facts have proved that many worker cadres, with the help of the leadership, have learned leadership, demonstrated the spirit of the working class, and played an active and creative role. For example, Yang Shaojin, the current chief of the production section of the Electric Factory, is now able to convene production group leaders every week to report, understand the difficulties of the workshop, and find ways to help solve them. He also overcame his fear of the staff and asked them to report every day, combining his own understanding of the actual situation of the workshop to raise problems, so that the staff could combine theory with practice, which was of great help to the staff. In this way, he also established prestige among the staff and had confidence in assuming the position of section chief.
    In addition, assigning specific personnel to help cadres yielded good results. For example, Xue Zuyou, a member of the Party branch committee, was responsible for helping Deputy Director Dong Fusheng. He accompanied Dong Fusheng in all meetings, problem-solving, and individual talks. Through practical work, specific research and discussion of problems, and continuous assistance, Dong Fusheng's work ability has been greatly improved. He did a good job in leading the work of the supply and marketing section and the general affairs section. In the past, the work of the supply and marketing section was not done well, and he was often criticized at meetings. Comrade Gu Shaokang, the section chief, was a worker cadre, hardworking and dedicated, but had few methods. He gritted his teeth and did his job even after being criticized, but he just couldn't do it well. After Dong Fusheng went down to understand the situation, he found that the problems of the supply and marketing section were related to the finance section and the planning section, and that the connection between the sections must be strengthened to solve them. Because the supply and marketing section needed to understand the production plan and financial system of the planning section, the planning section needed to correct the unrealistic plan, the production progress needed to be arranged, the finance section also needed to pay attention to reducing costs, and the supply and marketing section needed to study and solve the material problems. The supply and marketing section also needed to go to the workshop to understand the urgency of the materials and the opinions of the workers and the masses on the materials. After working in this way, the difficulties of the supply and marketing section were gradually solved, a procurement chart was formulated, the material supply was guaranteed, and the confidence of the cadres was improved. Through Dong Fusheng's specific help to the supply and marketing section, Comrade Gu Shaokang said: "In the future, we must always pay attention to strengthening the connection between the sections, and we are determined to go down to the workshop. Without going deep into the workshop and the masses, the supply and marketing work will not be done well."
    This also shows that Dong Fusheng, because he is an old worker in the factory, has a natural close relationship with the masses. Workers are willing to talk to him when they have difficulties or concerns. This is a condition for worker cadres to do their work more easily. Dong Fusheng has now gained experience in leadership work, knows how to arrange work, check work, knows that work should focus on key points, and knows that to solve difficult problems in work, it must be linked to political and ideological work. He said: "The problem lies in the leadership. As soon as you check the work and grasp the bottom, the bottom will move." He can also strictly demand himself, check his own thoughts and work once a day, and overcome his shortcomings at any time. He embodies the fine qualities of worker cadres.
    Party cadres going deep into production, deep into the workshops, and patiently and specifically helping to solve the difficulties in production is a way to improve worker cadres, and it is also a way to promote leaders to become familiar with production. For example, after Comrade Xue Zuyou helped Comrade Li Zhong, the director of the electrolysis workshop, he specifically calculated the details when adjusting the labor organization: how many people are needed for that work, how much work can one person do; he learned to calculate the volume of the electrolytic cell, taught him how to measure, how to calculate; when the current efficiency was not accurate, he taught him to calculate the current and voltage units, etc. Now Comrade Li Zhong has been able to record the daily current efficiency and the output of each cell in his notebook. After teaching him to read the representative symbols related to smelting several times, he was able to slowly remember them. Now his leadership work in the workshop has initially overcome bureaucratism, he can give play to the organizational strength, and he can also make a work report to the workshop. For example, Dong Xiang, the current director of the copper wire workshop of the Electric Factory, with the help of Comrade Wang Weicai, the deputy secretary of the Party branch, can now also initially get rid of bureaucratism, master the figures, master the production progress, and give play to the organizational strength.
    Worker cadres have an urgent desire to make progress, have great enthusiasm, and are easy to accept Marxism-Leninism. They are willing to delve into their work, and they can do it seriously after they have a clear understanding of the problem. If you can contact the reality when helping them, learn that line and learn that line, and instill theoretical knowledge in combination with production, they can accept it quickly. They are all brave to accept tasks and do not emphasize difficulties. When dealing with them, political and ideological work should be combined with specific assistance, and avoid using rude criticism; in this way, the worker cadres can maintain a full mood, help them to make better progress, and also make them dare to do work boldly and easily explore experience.
    In addition, worker cadres generally only like to approach workers, and are unwilling or afraid to approach staff, fearing that they will be said to have an unstable position by the workers; and they are also afraid that the staff have a high level of education and they cannot say anything. The Party branch paid attention to this issue. During the discussion of the national plan in April, the smelting plant strengthened the unity work of the department branch to the staff under the leadership of the Party branch. The department branch helped the worker cadres recognize the importance of mobilizing the staff in production and construction. After this work, the staff also leaned closer to the Party, and were more united with the worker cadres than in the past. At the same time, the worker cadres were also educated to recognize the importance of mobilizing the staff.
    After the split of the factory in April this year, the smelting plant promoted 21 worker cadres, including 3 section chiefs, 2 Party affairs and mass work cadres, 1 technician, 2 group leaders (equivalent to section chiefs), and 13 general cadres. The Electric Factory promoted 22 worker cadres, including 2 section chiefs, 2 section chiefs, 1 workshop director, 8 work section chiefs, 1 technician, 2 Party affairs and mass work cadres, and 6 general cadres. The two factories promoted a total of 43 worker cadres. The reason why they can be promoted in this way is of course because of the needs of the work, but more importantly because there was a work foundation for boldly cultivating and promoting worker cadres in the past. From the perspective of leading cadres, worker masses and staff, the understanding that promoting worker cadres can do a good job has been established, and the worker cadres have also strengthened their confidence that they can do a good job.
    From the "Three-Anti" campaign last year to the present, the former Kunming Electric Factory has implemented the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee's policy of cultivating and promoting a large number of cadres and focusing on cultivating and promoting worker and peasant cadres, closely combining with various movements, and cultivating and promoting many worker cadres from the movement through a combination of top-down understanding and bottom-up review by the masses. The achievements are great. Their experience in cultivating and promoting worker cadres can be used as a reference for leading cadres of industrial and mining enterprises.

    原昆明电工厂党总支培养提拔工人干部的经过
    李韵
    随着国家经济建设的开展，需要巨大数量的干部来担负各项工作；认真提拔和培养工人中的积极分子是干部的主要来源。从解放初期到今年四月，原昆明电工厂分为冶炼、电工两个厂，通过各种运动提拔了一批工人干部。这些工人干部大都积极负责，任劳任怨，服从领导，深入实际，和群众有密切联系；并能努力学习政治及文化，容易接受新鲜事物，能钻研业务、克服困难，对工作有信心，进步很快。工人干部刚被提拔起来时，是有思想顾虑的。如担心自己文化低，能力差，怕把工作做坏。在实际工作中，又因为没有工作经验，缺乏计划，不会抓关键，看见什么做什么，工作显得茫无头绪。
    但该厂党委已估计到了这种情况，主动地结合实际给以帮助，解决他们思想上工作上的困难问题。告诉大家大胆放手做工作，有党的领导，再注意依靠群众，就可以克服困难。如果工作做错了，首先领导上检讨自己的责任，鼓励他们继续努力。同时每周召开一次工人干部座谈会，交换工作中的问题和经验，研究克服困难的办法。领导上根据他们提出的问题，发动大家讨论研究，帮助总结提高，并交代具体办法。在第一次座谈会上，领导干部首先鼓舞了大家的信心和勇气；并告诉一些工作方法，提出了三条要大家执行：一是要有气魄、信心和学习精神；二要树立艰苦朴素作风；三要不忘本，永远保持和群众的联系。开了几次座谈会以后，大家都学会了一些工作方法，工作能力也提高了一些，曾经动摇的也开始稳定下来。后来，为能取得群众监督，又吸收了各车间的工人代表来参加座谈会；他们多半能将下面群众的意见带了上来，这就使工人干部认识到群众路线的重要，培养了批评和自我批评的思想作风。除座谈会外，每周还有两次碰头会，及时帮助解决工作中的问题，并号召各科自己学习业务。还强调新干部可以随时找领导干部个别谈话，争取领导帮助。当上级党委和行政部门开办训练班或召集专业会议时，工厂党委和行政领导都尽量地让工人干部去参加，以帮助他们提高政治和业务水平，巩固他们对工作的信心。
    通过工人干部座谈会，该厂的党总支有意识地帮助解决新干部所提出的问题以提高他们的工作能力，这一工作曾坚持了四个月之久，收效很大。新提拔起来的副厂长董福生同志说：“经过四个月的教育，使干部打下了学习和提高的基础，成为今后继续进步的条件。”但是，从政治改革转入生产建设以后，因生产任务繁重，一揽子的座谈会已不能解决生产工作中存在的问题；因此，总支改变了每周开一次座谈会的办法，建议行政会议加强对新干部的教育工作。行政会议每星期一次，领导干部听汇报后表扬成绩，总结经验，研究困难，提出办法。参加会议的人数比座谈会的少，解决问题比较集中，对干部起了一定的帮助作用。各科一般的都建立了科务会议制度。随着深入生产深入车间的过程，逐步克服了工作上的混乱现象。同时，虽然生产任务重，工作忙，但只要有开会及学习的机会，领导干部还是放手让干部参加。如财务科长何惠到昆明及北京开会回厂后，政治觉悟及业务知识都很快提高了。有的干部经总支送到市委举办的工人干部训练班学习，检查批判了自己的思想及工作作风，回厂后表现稳重、虚心，克服了骄傲急躁等情绪，工作有很大提高。
    由于在工人干部提拔起来时，曾进行过一些教育提高工作，如座谈会、碰头会、个别谈话、吸收群众参加会议提意见等，因此一般新干部对依靠群众的观点是较明确的，相信只要找群众就容易克服困难，愿意做群众的学生。这个根子扎得比较结实，在工人干部的生长过程中发挥了很大作用。这也是该厂党委教育工人干部的一项重要内容。如何惠同志能够在科务会议上带头检查自己的缺点，发动大家对他提意见。这样，就改进了工作，克服了主观主义。他还经常主动地找职员和老技工谈话，深入车间了解情况，发现问题，因此业务进步较快，对财务科长的工作职务就比较能胜任愉快，有了困难也能设法克服。又如现电工厂供销科长吴铣同志对于仓存已做到心中有数，能联系车间干部及群众，了解车间生产进度，制订采购计划，改变了供销工作的被动混乱情况；在六月份中做到没有停工待料，库存积压现象也逐渐减少。
    同时，该厂党委还注意教育和帮助工人干部学会领导方法。事实证明：许多工人干部，由于领导的帮助，学会了领导，表现了工人阶级的气魄，发挥了积极性、创造性。如现电工厂生产科长杨绍金，现在他能每周召集生产小组长汇报，了解车间困难，设法帮助解决。他还克服了畏惧职员的心理，每天要他们来汇报，结合自己所了解的车间实际情况，提出问题，使职员能把理论与实际结合起来，对职员帮助很大。这样他在职员当中也树立了威信，对于担负科长的职务也有了信心。
    另外，指定专人具体帮助干部，收效也很大。如总支委员薛祖佑同志负责帮助副厂长董福生同志。大小会议、解决问题及找人个别谈话等，都和董福生同志在一起。通过实际工作，具体研究讨论问题，进行经常的帮助，董福生同志的工作能力因此有了很大提高。在他负责领导供销科及总务科的工作中进行得很好。过去供销科工作做不好，在会上常受批评。科长顾少康同志是工人干部，任劳任怨，但办法少，受了批评也硬着头皮干，就是干不好。董福生同志下去了解情况后，发现供销科的问题和财务科、计划科都有关系，必须加强科与科之间的联系才能解决，因为供销科要了解计划科的生产计划及财务制度，计划科要改正不切实际的计划，要把生产进度排出来，财务科也要注意减低成本，和供销科研究解决用料问题，供销科还要常到车间了解用料的首次缓急情况，及工人群众对用料的意见。照这样工作以后，就逐步解决了供销科的困难，制订了采购图表，保证了材料供应，同时提高了干部的信心。通过了董福生同志对供销科的具体帮助，顾少康同志说：“以后要经常注意加强科与科的联系，决心下车间，不深入车间深入群众，供销工作是做不好的。”
    这也说明：董福生同志由于他是厂里的老工人，和群众有天然的密切的联系，工人有困难，有心事都愿意找他谈。这是工人干部可以较容易做好工作的条件。董福生同志现已取得了领导工作的经验，知道布置工作，检查工作，知道工作要抓重点，知道解决工作中的困难问题，必须和政治思想工作联系起来。他说：“问题在于领导，你一检查工作，一抓下面，下面就动起来了。”他也能严格要求自己，每天都要检查一次自己的思想及工作，随时克服缺点。从他的身上体现出了工人干部的优良品质。
    党的干部深入生产，深入车间，耐心具体帮助解决生产中的困难，是提高工人干部的办法，同时也是推动领导熟悉生产的办法。如经过薛祖佑同志帮助电解车间主任李忠同志，在调整劳动组织时，和他具体算细账：那个工作需要多少人，一个人可以做多少工作；学习算电解槽体积，教他怎样量，怎样算；当电流效率算不准时，教他算电流及电压单位等。现在李忠同志已经能把每天的电流效率和每槽产量记在笔记本上了。教他看了几次有关冶炼的代表符号后，他也就能慢慢记住。现在他对车间的领导工作，已初步克服了事务主义，能够发挥组织力量，并且能向车间做查定工作报告。又如现电工厂铜线车间主任董祥，经过总支副书记王维彩同志的帮助，现在也能初步摆脱事务主义，掌握数字，掌握生产进度，发挥组织力量。
    工人干部要求进步迫切，干劲很大，容易接受马克思列宁主义的思想。他们肯钻研业务，问题认识清楚后就能认真地去做。帮助他们时若能联系实际，干那行学那行，结合生产灌输给理论知识，就能很快地接受。他们都勇于接受任务，不强调困难。对待他们要把政治思想工作与具体帮助结合起来，避免用粗暴的批评方式；这样就能保持工人干部的饱满情绪，帮助他们更好地进步，也使他们敢于大胆做工作，易于摸索到经验。
    此外，工人干部一般只喜欢接近工人，不愿或怕和职员接近，怕被工人说立场不稳；又怕职员文化程度高，自己说不过。总支注意了这一问题，冶炼厂通过四月间讨论国家计划，在总支领导下，加强了科室支部对职员的团结工作。由科室支部帮助工人干部认识在生产建设中发动职员的重要。经过这个工作，职员对党也靠拢了一步，和工人干部也比过去更团结了。同时也教育了工人干部认识到发动职员的重要。
    今年四月分厂后，冶炼厂又提拔了工人干部二十一人，其中股长级三人，党务及群众工作干部二人，技术员一人，组长（相当于股长）二人，一般干部十三人。电工厂提拔了工人干部二十二人，其中科长级二人，股长级二人，车间主任一人，工段长八人，技术员一人，党务及群众工作干部二人，一般干部六人。两个厂共提拔工人干部四十三人。所以能够这样提拔起来，固然因为工作需要，但更主要的是因为以前有了放手大胆培养提拔工人干部的工作基础。从领导干部、工人群众及职员方面都建立了提拔工人干部能做好工作的认识，而在工人干部方面也坚定了自己能够做好工作的信心。
    从去年“三反”时到现在，原昆明电工厂执行了云南省委大量培养提拔干部和以培养提拔工农干部为主的方针，紧密结合各项运动，从运动中经过自上而下的了解和群众自下而上的审查相结合，培养提拔了许多工人干部，成绩是很大的。他们培养提拔工人干部的经验可供工矿企业领导干部参考。
