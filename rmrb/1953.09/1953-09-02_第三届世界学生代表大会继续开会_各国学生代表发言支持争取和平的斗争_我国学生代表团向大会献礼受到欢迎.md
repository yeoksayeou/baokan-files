Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, August 31st: The Third World Student Congress continued its sessions on August 28th and 29th, discussing the report presented to the Congress by IUS General Secretary Bellinger on behalf of the IUS Executive Committee: The current situation of students in various countries and the tasks of the IUS and national student organizations in the struggle to meet the needs and interests of students.

    At the meeting on the 28th, the representative of the Japan National Student Federation, Murakoshi Mikio (transliteration), said that the Japanese delegation agreed with Bellinger's report and hoped that the conference would strengthen the unity of students worldwide and contribute to the struggle for peace. Murakoshi Mikio spoke about the plight of Japanese students. He concluded by saying: Currently, 350,000 students are united under the banner of the National Student Federation. We oppose war and militarization, and we want to cooperate with students all over the world. We want peace, not war.

    The head of the Chinese student delegation, Tian Demin, spoke. He said: The Chinese student delegation came to participate in the conference, filled with friendly feelings towards students from all countries, and filled with the determination to fight for world peace and extensive cooperation among young students. He went on to say that Chinese students express sincere friendship and support to students in various countries who are suffering. He reported to the conference that the Asian Student Sanatorium had begun construction.

    Tian Demin cited figures to show that, for the first time in China, children of workers and peasants and young people of ethnic minorities have widely gained access to education. He concluded by expressing his support for Bellinger's report, saying: We believe that supporting the struggle of students in colonial territories for national independence and for a better learning environment should be a regular part of the activities of the IUS and national student organizations.

    Pakistani representative Noor Ali pointed out the necessity of developing cultural relations between Pakistani, Chinese, and Indian students. Brazilian representative Ciro Pantes suggested establishing a special department within the IUS to investigate the learning environment in secondary schools.

    At the meeting on the 29th, the speech by the head of the Soviet student delegation, Laposhin, was warmly welcomed. He spoke about the Soviet Union's peaceful policies, the development of the Soviet people's economy and culture, and the happy lives of Soviet students. He said: The Soviet socialist system has created the preconditions to improve the living and learning environment of students by every means, and to enable further development of science and culture. Soviet students are spiritually nurtured to respect all nations, large and small, and therefore they are convinced that peaceful coexistence of different social systems is possible, and they sincerely support closer cooperation among students of all countries. Through the Soviet Youth Anti-Fascist Committee, Soviet students maintain regular contact with more than two hundred student youth organizations in eighty countries.

    Laposhin said that Soviet students support and stand in solidarity with the just struggle of students in colonial and dependent countries, wholeheartedly endorse the IUS's activities to support the struggles of students in these countries, and the entire activities of the IUS's leading bodies. He concluded by emphasizing that students have a major responsibility in the struggle for peace and the easing of international tensions.

    The Malayan student representative then spoke, discussing the poverty of the Malayan people and the large number of children out of school under the plunder of the British colonial authorities. He said that Malayan students closely link their struggle with the Malayan people's struggle for liberation.

    An American student representative spoke, saying that one of the main tasks facing American students is to defend the right of young people to education. She said that the Un-American Activities Committee interferes in all aspects of people's lives, and the situation created by war preparations and national militarization deprives American youth of the opportunity to study. She concluded by asking the conference to support the struggle of American students for democratization of education and to take concrete measures to expand exchanges between student organizations.

    The representative of the French student organizations that have not yet joined the IUS, Pierre Clement, spoke at the meeting, expressing satisfaction with the efforts made by the conference to seek a basis for cooperation among students worldwide. He said that, on the basis of the IUS constitution, cooperation among students worldwide is possible.

    Hungarian representative György Vihert talked about the widespread enjoyment of educational rights by Hungarian youth under the care of the people's government. The representative of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Tran Nhat Dong (transliteration), also spoke, saying that despite the difficult circumstances of the war against the French colonialists, under the leadership of the Vietnamese people's own government, Vietnamese education has made great achievements.

    Representatives of the World Federation of Trade Unions, Kwoshevich, the chairman of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, Bernini, as well as the Gold Coast, Czechoslovakia, Burma, Colombia, Argentina, Poland, Belgium, Greece, Haiti, Ceylon, Bulgaria, Venezuela, South Africa, Mexico, Brazil, Thailand, West Africa, Romania, Guatemala, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Cyprus, Sudan, Canada, Bolivia and other student organizations also spoke at the two-day meeting.

    Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, August 28th (Delayed): At the meeting of the Third World Student Congress on August 28th, the head of the Chinese student delegation, Tian Demin, spoke, introducing the development of education in New China, the happy lives of Chinese students, and the efforts of Chinese students to strive for peace and cooperation among students from all countries. His speech was warmly welcomed by the conference.

    After Tian Demin's speech, the Chinese student delegation presented gifts to the conference. The first gift was a large brocade banner with the words: "Dedicated to the Third World Student Congress, Students all over the world unite and advance towards peace, national independence, and democratic education!" The second gift was a model and design plan of the Asian Student Sanatorium, which started construction in Beijing on August 5th. This sanatorium is being built by the All-China Students' Federation commissioned by the International Student Union. When the Chinese delegation presented these two gifts, all the delegates applauded warmly for a long time.

    田德民列举数字，说明中国现在工农子弟和少数民族青年已第一次广泛地得到受教育的机会。他最后表示拥护贝林格的报告，并说：我们认为，支持殖民地学生争取民族独立和争取优良学习环境的斗争，应该成为国际学联和各国学生团体经常活动的一部分。
