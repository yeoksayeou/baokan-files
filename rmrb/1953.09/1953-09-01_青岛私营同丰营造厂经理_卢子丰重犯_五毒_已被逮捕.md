Qingdao Private Tongfeng Construction Factory Manager
Lu Zifeng Rearrested for Repeatedly Committing "Five Evils"

The unscrupulous merchant Lu Zifeng, manager of the Qingdao Private Tongfeng Construction Factory, was arrested by the government for committing the "Five Evils" during the "Five-Anti" campaign and was later released after education. However, after his release, he did not correct his mistakes and engage in legitimate business, but instead relapsed into the "Five Evils," stealing state assets. When repairing and constructing new barracks for a local military unit, he engaged in large-scale corner-cutting. In the repair project, according to the contract, the flooring should have been made of fir and pine wood, but he used old pine planks. He calculated two hundred and four square feet for one hundred square feet of plastered wall. In the new construction project, the contract stipulated that the walls should be built entirely of stone, but he mixed in half broken bricks. The doors and windows should have been painted three times, but he did not even paint them once completely. In addition, he used far fewer materials for concrete floors, rammed earth, and plastered ceilings.

As a result of the unscrupulous merchant Lu Zifeng's corner-cutting, the roof tiles of the newly built houses collapsed after only one rainfall. The newly built classroom leaked water into the room after a rain because the foundation was too low.

After the workers reported the illegal activities of the unscrupulous merchant Lu Zifeng, the Qingdao Municipal People's Procuratorate, in conjunction with the Federation of Industry and Commerce, the Labor Bureau, the Industry and Commerce Bureau, the Trade Union Federation, and other relevant departments, investigated and confirmed that the facts were true. The Qingdao Municipal People's Government has arrested Lu Zifeng and brought him to justice.

    青岛私营同丰营造厂经理
    卢子丰重犯“五毒”已被逮捕
    青岛市私营同丰营造厂经理奸商卢子丰，在“五反”时因犯“五毒”曾被政府逮捕，后经教育释放。但是，他在被释放后并没有改正错误，进行正当营业，却重犯“五毒”，盗窃国家资财。在给当地驻军某部修缮和新建营房时，他大肆偷工减料。在修缮工程中，按照合同，地板应该用杉松木料，他却用旧松板。粉刷了一百平方呎的墙皮，他算了二百零四平方呎。在新建工程中，按照合同规定应该全用石头砌墙，可是他掺了一半碎砖。门窗应该油漆三遍，他连一遍也没油全。另外，打水泥地、三合土地、墁天棚等，也都少用了很多材料。
    奸商卢子丰偷工减料的结果，刚盖起来的房子只下了一次雨，房瓦就塌了。新建的课堂因地基打得太洼，一下雨就向屋里流水。
    奸商卢子丰的违法行为被工人检举后，经青岛市人民检察署会同工商联、劳动局、工商局、总工会等有关部门调查证实事实确凿，青岛市人民政府已将卢子丰逮捕法办。
