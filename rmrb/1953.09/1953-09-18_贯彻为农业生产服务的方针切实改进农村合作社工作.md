In response to readers' criticisms and suggestions in the "Reader's Letters Summary" column in May and June, which published some readers' critical letters about shortcomings in the work of certain cooperatives, we now publish excerpts of the replies from relevant units:

Regarding the waste that occurred in the fertilizer supply work of the Zhangjiakou Office of the Hebei Provincial Cooperative General Agency for Production Materials this spring (the original letter of criticism appeared in this newspaper on May 5), both the North China Supply and Marketing Cooperative General Agency and the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative Organizational Guidance Group replied. After investigation, the reasons for the problem were: First, the county cooperatives did not investigate the actual needs of farmers and blindly reported fertilizer supply plans for this spring; while the provincial and district cooperatives did not strictly review the plans before approving them, resulting in an excessive amount being transferred. Second, the policy of focusing on local materials, local processing, and local supply for fertilizer was not seriously implemented. The black beans transported from other places were more expensive than local ones due to transportation costs, making them difficult to sell. The North China Supply and Marketing Cooperative General Agency has already allocated and handled this batch of stockpiled fertilizer and notified various localities to pay attention to this matter to avoid similar incidents from happening again.

The Cangxian District Office of the Hebei Provincial Cooperative General Agency sent a letter responding to the problems in the operation of the Hejian County Cooperative (the original letter of criticism appeared in this newspaper on May 5). The letter said: The provincial and district cooperative general agencies attached great importance to the readers' criticism, and the Hejian County Cooperative inspected its work based on this criticism. The reason why many grassroots cooperatives in the county generally lost money was that the county cooperative's leadership over the grassroots cooperatives was insufficient, and there were too many personnel in the grassroots cooperatives, resulting in excessive expenses. As for the reason why lower-level cooperatives and cooperative members had opinions on the prices of goods in the county cooperative: some goods were indeed more expensive due to the county cooperative's poor management; although some goods were not expensive, the county cooperative did not have close relations with the lower-level cooperatives and did not promptly disclose costs. The county cooperative has exchanged views with the reader He Weiyu and is determined to improve its work.

The Preparatory Committee of the Guizhou Provincial Cooperative Union sent the Qinglong County Cooperative's review of the reader's criticism (the original letter of criticism appeared in this newspaper on May 5). The Qinglong County Cooperative said in its letter: The chaotic situation in our cooperative's work is indeed very serious, and the policy of serving production and serving cooperative members has not been well implemented. In terms of supply work, most of our funds were used to operate general merchandise, and the supply of agricultural tools urgently needed by farmers was very small, and some were not up to specifications. In terms of purchasing agricultural and sideline products, because we did not pay enough attention, we only completed about 20% of the plan in the first quarter. Shortcomings were also very serious in planning, financial work, and leadership over grassroots cooperatives; the reader's revelations are all facts. We have decided to purchase and supply agricultural production materials according to the needs of farmers, improve the specifications of agricultural tools, actively purchase agricultural and sideline products, re-examine the purchase prices, strengthen investigation and research, earnestly formulate plans, clear old accounts, establish new accounts, and earnestly help the four grassroots cooperatives in the county to develop their business in order to improve our work.

The Organizational Guidance Office of the Suiyuan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative General Agency sent a letter responding to the problem of excessively high prices of agricultural tools supplied by the Taolin County Cooperative (the original letter of criticism appeared in this newspaper on May 25). The letter said that after our inspection, the reasons for the high prices of agricultural tools in the Taolin County Cooperative were: high purchase prices, many levels involved; the price inspectors did not grasp the market prices well; and the county cooperative had a fear of losing money, so the profit was set too high. The cooperative has now adjusted the prices of agricultural tools and returned the overpayments for agricultural tools sold at high prices to the members.

The Shaanxi Province Qianxian County Cooperative Union sent a letter reviewing the problem of treating agricultural pesticide supply work with a negative attitude (the original letter of criticism appeared in this newspaper on May 25). The letter said: In our work of supplying agricultural pesticides, we mistakenly believed that "mobilizing the masses is the government's business, loans are the bank's business, and supply is the cooperative's business," so we did not actively promote sales and just sat and waited for farmers to come and buy. This shows that our understanding of the cooperative's policy of facing production is insufficient, and that we still have bureaucracy that does not care about the interests of the masses. Relevant comrades in our cooperative have made a public review of this issue and are determined to correct this mistake in the future.

The Henan Province Chenliu County Cooperative Union sent a letter reviewing the problem of being irresponsible in supplying agricultural pesticides (the original letter of criticism appeared in this newspaper on June 27). The letter said: We do not have a clear understanding of the cooperative's policy of facing production. When promoting production materials, we only complain that the party and government leadership departments have not done enough publicity, the farms have not played a demonstration role, and the technical guidance stations have not kept up with the transmission of technology; but we do not actively think of ways to do a good job in promotion. As a result, farmers needed agricultural pesticides but could not buy them, while the cooperative had stockpiles. Recently, we have improved this passive approach, sending cadres and delivery trucks with agricultural pesticides and insecticide equipment to the countryside to promote sales; and we are determined to work hard to do a good job in supplying agricultural production materials in the future.

The Sichuan Province Zhangming County Cooperative Union sent a letter explaining and reviewing the problem of not doing a good job in supplying agricultural tools (the original letter of criticism appeared in this newspaper on June 27). The letter said: The reader's criticism that our agricultural tools are high in price, low in quality, and not supplied in a timely manner is indeed a fact. We prepared for the supply of agricultural tools relatively early, but because the county People's Bank issued agricultural tool loans relatively late, the agricultural tool loans were also late in reaching the farmers. Because our agricultural tools were prepared during the peak season, the price seemed high when they were supplied, and we did not adjust it in time. As for the poor quality and non-standard specifications of some agricultural tools, this was due to our poor acceptance work. We will definitely earnestly improve the supply of agricultural tools in the future and better serve agricultural production.

### 贯彻为农业生产服务的方针切实改进农村合作社工作

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    贯彻为农业生产服务的方针切实改进农村合作社工作
    五、六月份“读者来信摘要”栏曾发表了一些读者对某些合作社工作中缺点的批评信，现将有关单位的答复信摘要发表于后：
    关于河北省合作总社张家口办事处生产资料批发站今春肥料供应工作中发生浪费的问题（原批评信见五月五日本报），华北供销合作总社和河北省供销合作总社组导处都来信作了答复。经检查，问题发生的原因是：一，各县合作社不调查农民实际需要，盲目造报今春供肥计划；而省、专区合作社对计划没有严格审查就批准了，以致调运数量过大。二，没有认真贯彻以当地取材、当地加工、当地供应为主的供肥方针。从外地运来的黑豆因为需要运输费用，价格比当地还高，不易销售。华北供销合作总社对这批积压的肥料已经调拨处理，并将这个事件通报各地注意，以避免今后再发生类似事件。
    河北省合作总社沧县专区办事处来信，对河间县合作社经营有缺点的问题（原批评信见五月五日本报）作了答复。来信说：省、专区合作总社对读者批评都很重视，河间县合作社根据这个批评检查了工作。该县不少基层社普遍赔本的原因是县社对基层社领导不够，基层社人员太多，开支太大。至于下级社和社员群众对县社货物价格有意见的原因是：因县社经营不善，有些货价的确较高；有些货价虽不高，但因县社和下级社关系不密切，也没及时公开成本。县社已和读者何维玉交换了意见，并决心改进工作。
    贵州省合作社联合社筹备委员会寄来了晴隆县合作社对读者批评（原批评信见五月五日本报）的检讨。晴隆县合作社来信说：我社工作中混乱情况的确很严重，为生产服务、为社员服务的方针没有很好贯彻。在供应工作方面，我社大部分资金用于经营百货，对农民急需的农具供应很少，而且有的还不合规格。在收购农副产品工作方面，因为我们重视不够，第一季度只完成计划百分之二十左右。在计划工作、财务工作和对基层社的领导方面缺点也很严重；读者揭发的都是事实。我们决定根据农民需要采购和供应农业生产资料，改进农具规格；积极收购农副产品，重新核订收购价格；加强调查研究，切实订好计划；清理旧账，建立新账；认真帮助全县四个基层社开展业务，来改进我们的工作。
    绥远省供销合作总社组导处来信，对陶林县合作社供应的农具价格过高问题（原批评信见五月二十五日本报）作了答复。来信说，经我们检查，陶林县合作社农具价格高的原因是：进货价格高，经过的层次多；物价员核定价格时没有很好掌握市价；而县社又有怕赔钱思想，利润订得过高。现在该社已经调整了农具价格；并将过去高价卖出农具的多收款项退回社员。
    陕西省乾县合作社联合社来信检讨了用消极态度对待农药供应工作的问题（原批评信见五月二十五日本报）。来信说：我们在供应农药工作中，错误地认为“发动群众是政府的事，贷款是银行的事，供应才是合作社的事”，因而不去主动推销，光坐着等农民来买。这说明我们对合作社应该面向生产的方针认识不足，说明我们还有着不关心群众利益的官僚主义。我社有关同志对这个问题已作公开检讨，今后决心改正这种错误。
    河南省陈留县合作社联合社来信检讨了对供应农药工作不负责的问题（原批评信见六月二十七日本报）。来信说：我们对合作社应该面向生产的方针没有明确的认识，推销生产资料时光埋怨党政领导部门宣传工作做得不够，农场没有起示范作用，技术指导站传授技术跟不上；而自己却不积极想办法做好推销工作。这样，就发生了农民需要农药买不到而合作社却有积压的情况。最近我们已改进这种被动的做法，派干部和送货车带着农药和杀虫器械下乡推销；并决心在今后努力做好农业生产资料的供应工作。
    四川省彰明县合作社联合社来信对农具供应工作做得不好的问题（原批评信见六月二十七日本报）作了说明和检讨。来信说：读者批评我社农具价格高、质量低并且供应不及时，确系事实。我们对农具供应工作准备是较早的，但因为县人民银行发放农具贷款较迟，所以农具贷到农民手中也就迟了。因为我们的农具是在旺季准备的，在供应时价格就显得高了，我们也没及时调整。至于有些农具质量差和不合规格，则是我们验收工作做得不好所致。我们今后一定认真改进农具供应工作，更好地为农业生产服务。
