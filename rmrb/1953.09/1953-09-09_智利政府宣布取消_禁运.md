Xinhua News Agency, Santiago, August 8th: Chilean President Carlos Ibáñez signed a decree on September 3rd, canceling the existing decree prohibiting the export of strategic materials to peaceful and democratic countries.

    Chilean Minister of Economy Rafael Tarud, in explaining the reasons for the Chilean President's signing of the above decree, pointed out that the embargo was "harmful to the interests of Chile."

    Chile's main export is copper, and its income accounts for about half of the country's total income. In the past, the United States suppressed the price of Chilean copper and at the same time prohibited Chile from exporting to peaceful and democratic countries, which put Chile's economic situation in a very difficult position for a long time.

    智利政府宣布取消“禁运”
    【新华社八日讯】圣地亚哥消息：智利总统卡洛斯·伊巴湼斯九月三日签署了一项法令，取消了禁止将战略物资输出给和平民主国家的现行法令。
    智利经济部长拉斐尔·塔鲁德在解释智利总统签署上述法令的原因时指出，禁运是“有害智利的利益的”。
    按智利的主要输出品是铜，它的收入约占全国总收入的一半。由于过去美国压低价格收购智利的铜，同时又禁止智利向和平民主国家输出，曾使智利的经济状况长期处在非常窘迫的地位。
