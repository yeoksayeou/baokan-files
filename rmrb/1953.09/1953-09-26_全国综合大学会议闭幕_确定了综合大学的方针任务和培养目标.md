Xinhua News Agency, September 25th: The National Comprehensive University Conference concluded on the 23rd. The conference defined the direction, tasks, and training objectives of comprehensive universities, and discussed issues such as academic program establishment, teaching plans, scientific research, and faculty development.

    The conference summarized the educational work of comprehensive universities over the past two years, affirmed the achievements of past work, analyzed the shortcomings of higher education institutions, especially comprehensive universities, in the ideological remolding movement of teachers, departmental adjustments, and teaching reforms. It criticized the underestimation of the role of comprehensive universities in the past, which had not been given due attention. It pointed out that these shortcomings were mainly the responsibility of the central educational administrative departments, thus unifying the participants' understanding of past work and providing favorable conditions for formulating future work guidelines, tasks, and plans.

    Huang Songling, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government, delivered a report at the meeting on "The Direction and Tasks of Comprehensive Universities" on behalf of Minister Ma Xulun. Vice Minister Zeng Zhaolun gave a report on the establishment of academic programs and revision of teaching plans for comprehensive universities. Vice Minister Yang Xiufeng conveyed the general line and general tasks of the nation. Xi Zhongxun, Deputy Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government, and Qian Junrui, Secretary-General, attended the meeting and gave important instructions. The conference also invited Qian Sanqiang, head of the Chinese Academy of Sciences delegation to the Soviet Union, to give a report on scientific research work in the Soviet Union and China. Based on these instructions, reports, and the general line and general tasks of the nation's gradual transition to socialism, the conference studied the direction, tasks, and existing problems of comprehensive universities. The conference held that the position of higher education in the nation's general line is an important link in cultivating qualified cadres for the nation, that is, first and foremost, Marxism-Leninism, the science of the laws of natural and social development, must be the foundation of higher education institutions. Secondly, adapting to the different construction talents required by different sectors of the national economic construction plan, professional education of different types should be carried out on the basis of broad basic knowledge, so that theory and practice are combined, and comprehensive development and specialized training are combined, in order to cultivate experts who are competent in various construction undertakings. This is the path that new-type higher education institutions should follow in order to cultivate talents with both morality and ability, and it is also the basic direction of comprehensive universities. However, comprehensive universities have a specific position in higher education institutions, and therefore, under the general direction, they have specific tasks that distinguish them from other specialized higher education institutions. The task of other specialized higher education institutions is mainly to cultivate specialized talents engaged in practical work in technical sciences (natural sciences and social sciences), while the task of comprehensive universities is mainly to cultivate specialized talents engaged in research or teaching work in theoretical or basic sciences (natural sciences and social sciences), and to transport research and teaching cadres to economic and cultural departments, specifically, to cultivate scientific researchers and teachers for higher education institutions, as well as teachers for secondary schools. The conference held that the training objective of comprehensive universities should be to cultivate research talents or teachers who meet certain specifications in accordance with the direction and tasks, and the main goal is to cultivate scientific research talents who meet certain specifications, that is, to enable students to have a higher theoretical level and a broader scientific knowledge, so that they can understand the basic laws of general natural sciences or social sciences, so that they have a good foundation, and then gradually carry out professional training, and gradually develop the ability to independently and creatively carry out research work, and be good at solving certain theoretical and practical problems in their own specialties on the basis of Marxist-Leninist methodology. But this does not mean that graduates can do it right away, but they must go through a considerable period of training to gradually improve their skills.

    The conference also timely raised the importance of scientific research work in comprehensive universities. The conference pointed out that comprehensive universities are mainly teaching institutions, but also research institutions. Teaching and research work are mutually beneficial and mutually improved, and they are combined rather than contradictory. The teaching and research department is the basic organization that combines teaching and research work. Comprehensive universities must closely cooperate with various scientific research institutions and relevant business departments in order to better combine practical needs and give full play to teaching effectiveness. The conference discussed the "Interim Measures for Scientific Research Work in Higher Education Institutions" (draft), which clarified the general scope of scientific research work in higher education institutions and the leadership, organization, and other systems of research work.

    The conference emphasized that in the future, we should pay great attention to the role of existing teachers, strengthen the unity, remolding, and improvement of existing teachers, and vigorously cultivate new teachers. The conference also criticized the past phenomenon of underestimating the role of old teachers. It established that in the future, we should continue to advocate the unity of new and old teachers, old teachers helping new teachers, young teachers learning from old teachers, and students respecting teachers. The conference also discussed the "Measures for Cultivating Graduate Students in Higher Education Institutions" (draft) and the "Interim Measures for Advanced Studies for Advanced Students in Comprehensive Universities" (draft).

    The conference studied the principles of departmental adjustments, academic program establishment, and development scale of various schools in comprehensive universities, and the teaching plans for mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology and other majors drafted by some science teachers in Qingdao during the summer vacation this year. It also focused on discussing the problems and teaching plans in liberal arts such as Chinese and history.

    Huang Songling, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government, made a summary report on the 23rd. In his report, he pointed out that in order to implement the direction, tasks, and spirit of the conference for comprehensive universities in the future, first of all, the direction and tasks of higher education must be closely integrated with the general line and general tasks of the nation. Secondly, we must grasp the spirit of gradual transition and steady progress. The work of various schools to learn from the Soviet Union and combine with China's actual situation to carry out teaching reforms must recognize its long-term, complex, and unbalanced development, and pay attention to the difficulties in development, overcome difficulties, create conditions, and move forward steadily. Third, we must prevent both rashness and conservatism in learning from the Soviet Union, setting up academic programs, cultivating and improving teachers, and scientific research. Vice Minister Huang Songling called on everyone to seize the main tasks, run the existing majors well, concentrate efforts to cultivate new teachers and improve existing teachers, strengthen political and ideological leadership, strengthen teaching leadership, lead teachers to systematically study Marxism-Leninism, study politics and business, launch academic and ideological discussions and criticisms, fully promote academic democracy, and do a good job in the unity of new and old teachers.

    全国综合大学会议闭幕
    确定了综合大学的方针任务和培养目标
    【新华社二十五日讯】全国综合大学会议已在二十三日闭幕，这次会议确定了综合大学的方针任务和培养目标，讨论了专业设置、教学计划、科学研究工作和师资培养等问题。
    这次会议总结了两年来综合大学教育工作，肯定了过去工作的成绩，分析了高等学校特别是综合大学在教师思想改造运动、院系调整和教学改革工作中所产生的缺点，批判了过去对综合大学的作用估计不足没有予以应有的重视，并指出这些缺点主要应由中央教育行政部门负责，使与会人员统一了对过去工作的认识，为制订今后工作方针任务和工作计划提供了有利条件。
    中央人民政府高等教育部黄松龄副部长代马叙伦部长在会上作了“关于综合大学的方针和任务”的报告，曾昭抡副部长作了关于综合大学专业设置及修订教学计划的报告，杨秀峰副部长对国家总路线和总任务进行了传达，中央人民政府政务院文化教育委员会习仲勋副主任、钱俊瑞秘书长都到会作了重要指示。会议还邀请中国科学院访苏代表团团长钱三强作了关于苏联科学研究工作和中国科学研究工作的报告。会议根据这些指示、报告和国家逐步过渡到社会主义的总路线和总任务，研究了综合大学的方针任务和工作中存在的问题。会议认为高等教育在国家总路线中的地位是为国家培养合格干部的重要一环，即首先以马克思列宁主义关于自然和社会发展规律的科学，作为高等学校所必须具备的基础。其次，适应国家经济建设计划所要求的不同部门的不同建设人材，在广博的基础知识之上进行不同类型的专业教育，使其理论与实际相结合，全面发展与专业训练相结合，以培养出对各种建设事业能胜任的专家。这就是新型高等学校为培养德才兼备的人材所应遵循的道路，也是综合大学的基本方针。但综合大学在高等学校中又有其特定的地位，因而在一般方针之下，更有其特定的任务与其他专科性质的高等学校有所区别。其他专科性高等学校的任务主要是培养技术科学（自然科学和社会科学）方面从事实际工作的专门人材，综合大学的任务主要是培养理论或基础科学（自然科学和社会科学）方面从事研究工作或教学工作的专门人材，为经济和文化部门输送研究和教学干部，具体地说，就是培养科学研究工作者和高等学校的师资以及中等学校的师资。会议认为综合大学的培养目标应根据方针、任务培养合乎一定规格的研究人材或师资，
  而以培养合乎一定规格的科学研究人材为主要目
  标，就是使学生具有较高深的理论水平与较广阔的
  科学知识，以能通晓一般自然科学或社会科学的各种基本规律，使其具有良好的基础，再逐步进行专业训练，逐渐养成能独立地、创造性地进行研究工作，并善于在马克思列宁主义方法论的基础上解决自己专业方面的某些理论和实际的问题。但这不是说刚毕业的学生就能作到，而须经过相当时期的锻炼，逐步提高才能作到。
    这次会议还及时地提出了科学研究工作在综合大学的重要性。会议指出，综合大学主要是一个教学机构，同时也是一个研究机构。教学与研究工作是互相为用、互相提高的，是互相结合而不是互相矛盾的，教学研究室就是结合教学工作和研究工作的基本组织。综合大学必须与各种科学研究机构及有关业务部门取得密切配合，才能更好地结合实际需要与发挥教学效能。会议中讨论了“高等学校科学研究工作暂行办法”（草案），明确了高等学校科学研究工作的大致范围和研究工作的领导、组织等制度。
    这次会议强调指出，今后应十分重视现有教师的作用，加强团结、改造和提高现有教师，和大力培养新师资。会议并批判了过去对老教师的作用估计不足的现象。确立今后应继续提倡新老教师团结，老教师帮助新教师，青年教师向老教师学习，学生尊重教师的风气。会上对“高等学校培养研究生办法”（草案）及“综合大学进修生进修暂行办法”（草案）也进行了讨论。
    会议研究了综合大学院系调整、专业设置及各校发展规模的原则，和今年暑期一部分理科教师在青岛拟订的数学、物理、化学、生物等专业的教学计划，并着重讨论了语文、历史等文科方面存在的问题和教学计划。
    中央人民政府高等教育部黄松龄副部长在二十三日作了总结报告。他在报告中指出，今后如何贯彻综合大学的方针任务和大会精神，首先要使高等教育的方针任务和国家总路线总任务密切结合起来。其次必须掌握逐步过渡稳步前进的精神。各校学习苏联与中国实际情况相结合进行教学改革的工作，必须认识其长期性、复杂性和发展不平衡性，并注意发展中的困难，要克服困难，创造条件，稳步前进。第三在学习苏联、专业设置、培养提高教师和科学研究工作等方面都要防止冒进与保守两种偏向。黄松龄副部长号召大家抓住主要工作，把现有专业办好；集中力量培养新师资和提高现有师资；加强政治思想领导，加强教学领导，领导教师有系统地学习马克思列宁主义，学习政治和业务，展开学术上和思想上的讨论和批评，充分发扬学术上的民主，作好新老教师的团结工作。
