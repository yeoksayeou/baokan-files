    Songjiang Province Grain Department Pre-purchases Over 100,000 Tons of New Grain from Farmers
    In order to help farmers solve difficulties in summer hoeing and autumn harvesting, and to enable farmers to carry out production smoothly, the Songjiang Province Grain Department has pre-purchased more than 100,000 tons of new grain from farmers since mid-July.
    The targets of grain pre-purchase in Songjiang Province are mainly farming households with difficulties in summer hoeing and autumn harvesting. During pre-purchase, 35% of the payment for wheat and coarse grains and 50% of the payment for rice are made in cash according to the national standard grade purchase price at the time and place. It is also stipulated that prices will be allowed to rise but not fall, so as to prevent farmers who pre-sell from suffering losses.
    In order to earnestly carry out this new grain pre-purchase work to protect the interests of farmers, the Grain Department of the Songjiang Provincial People's Government and the Provincial Cooperative General Agency jointly issued instructions requiring all localities to resolutely prevent coercion and arbitrary apportionment in the pre-purchase process; grassroots cooperatives must use the funds for their designated purpose and keep the accounts clear.

    松江省粮食部门向农民预购新粮十余万吨
    松江省粮食部门为了帮助农民解决夏锄、秋收中的困难，使农民顺利进行生产，从七月中旬开始先后向农民预购新粮十余万吨。
    松江省预购粮食的对象，主要是夏锄和秋收中有困难的农户。预购时，按当时当地国家规定的标准品收购价格，小麦和粗粮预付百分之三十五的现款，水稻预付百分之五十的现款。同时规定价格听涨不听落，以免预售农民吃亏。
    为了切实做好这一保护农民利益的新粮预购工作，松江省人民政府粮食厅和省合作总社联合发出指示，要求各地在预购中坚决防止强迫命令和平均摊派现象；基层合作社要专款专用，把帐目记清。（李光友）
