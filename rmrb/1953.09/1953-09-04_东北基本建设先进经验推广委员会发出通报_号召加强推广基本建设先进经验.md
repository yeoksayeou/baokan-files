The Northeast Basic Construction Advanced Experience Promotion Committee Issues Circular
Calling for Strengthening the Promotion of Advanced Experience in Basic Construction

[By Our Own Correspondent] Currently, the work of promoting advanced experiences in basic construction units in Northeast China is underway, but some provinces and cities are acting slowly, and have not yet formulated specific plans for promoting advanced experiences. There are many general calls, but a lack of specific measures. In order to effectively carry out the work of promoting advanced experience, the Northeast Basic Construction Advanced Experience Promotion Committee recently issued a circular on strengthening the promotion of advanced experience to ensure the comprehensive completion of construction tasks, instructing all localities to do the following:

First, strengthen the leadership of promoting advanced experience, especially to make leading cadres realize that promoting advanced experience is the fundamental method to improve labor productivity, improve technology, ensure quality, complete basic construction tasks, and accelerate national industrialization. It is also the most effective way to implement labor quotas and increase the actual wage income of workers. Therefore, it is necessary to criticize and overcome various conservative and complacent ideas. To strengthen leadership, leading cadres in basic construction departments must take the lead in studying and delving into their work, understanding and mastering the characteristics and roles of advanced experience, making themselves role models for learning advanced experience among the masses, and truly taking responsibility for organizing and promoting it. It is necessary to establish and improve organizational structures for leading the promotion of advanced experience to ensure that the work of promoting advanced experience receives uninterrupted leadership. Provinces and cities that have not yet established basic construction advanced experience promotion committees should quickly establish them according to the instructions of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, composed of party, administrative, trade union, Communist Youth League, and enterprise cadres, technical personnel, and representatives of advanced producers, and equip them with appropriate cadres to be responsible for leading, inspecting, summarizing, and promoting advanced experience. Companies and construction sites should also establish specialized management agencies to regularly summarize and promote advanced experience.

Second, carry out promotion work with leadership and planning. It is necessary to grasp the key problems of the project in different periods based on the characteristics and laws of basic construction, and promote various advanced experiences in a focused and step-by-step manner, especially paying attention to the promotion of decisive advanced experiences. For example, in design, promote the "new design standards" and "standard design"; in mechanical installation, promote "pre-assembly" and "combined installation method"; in civil engineering construction management, promote "parallel flow operation" and "engineering task list"; in operation, promote "double-hand slurry squeezing method" and "spirit level bricklaying method." At the same time, it is necessary to grasp the key units and weak links according to the construction season to promote relevant advanced experiences. For example, in the construction preparation stage, vigorously promote advanced experiences in "design" and "geological drilling." When carrying out foundation engineering, promote advanced experiences in "excavation" and "concrete pouring." The circular also pointed out that while promoting advanced experience, attention should be paid to supporting various technical improvements, inventions, creations, and rationalization proposals of the masses, calling on employees to find tricks and tap potential. After advanced experiences are discovered, they should be reviewed and identified in a timely manner, given technical assistance in a timely manner, rewarded and commended in a timely manner, and summarized in a timely manner. Methods such as holding "advanced experience promotion conferences," "demonstration meetings," and "exhibitions," and holding "competitions of the same type of work" should be adopted to promote advanced experience. Units with Soviet experts must fully mobilize and organize all employees to conscientiously implement the suggestions of Soviet experts. Where there are no Soviet experts, efforts should also be made to organize the study and promotion of Soviet advanced experience.

Third, strengthen political work and strengthen the ideological education of employees. Overcome various conservative ideas and concerns among workers and staff, fully mobilize the masses, and mobilize workers and technical personnel to cooperate closely, so that theory and practice are combined, and promoting advanced experience becomes a conscious action of the masses. Education should be carried out through organizing performances, visits, introducing advanced figures and advanced ideas, and comparing good and bad, and comparing new and old ideas. At the same time, propaganda and mobilization work should be strengthened, and all kinds of effective propaganda tools should be fully utilized, using blackboards, cartoons, honor rolls, advanced experience promotion stations, and broadcasting stations to systematically promote advanced figures, advanced ideas, and various advanced experiences. Leading cadres should go deep into the front line, discover budding advanced experiences in a timely manner, assist them, and focus on cultivating typical groups and advanced figures, improving their political and technical level, making them the backbone of promoting advanced experience, and then comprehensively promoting it after having relatively mature advanced experience.

Fourth, the promotion of advanced experience must be combined with the current central work. Specifically, it must be combined with the implementation of the responsibility system, strengthening technical management, and strengthening labor discipline education. It must never be carried out in isolation. For example, when implementing the responsibility system, it is necessary to implement the responsibility system for learning from the Soviet Union and promoting advanced experience, and promote the advanced experience in implementing the responsibility system in a timely manner. To strengthen technical management, mature advanced experience must be incorporated into technical operating procedures, and all employees must be educated to strictly abide by them, especially paying attention to promoting advanced experience in improving quality and improving technology. Strengthening labor discipline education must also be combined with cultivating advanced figures, establishing advanced ideas, introducing advanced experience, and improving employee welfare issues. In the process of promotion, administrative management must be strengthened to solve various specific problems after the promotion of advanced experience, such as improving labor organization, ensuring the supply of tools and materials, production balance, adjusting labor quotas, and improving wage and welfare issues.

The circular finally requires leading cadres at all levels to be personally responsible, oppose bureaucratic and formalistic leadership styles, and conscientiously implement the spirit of the Urban Work Conference and Basic Construction Conference of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Under the unified plan of the local advanced experience promotion committees, the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League must closely cooperate and specifically divide the work. The Party organizations of the Communist Party of China must promptly supervise and inspect and strengthen the leadership of the work of promoting advanced experience.

    东北基本建设先进经验推广委员会发出通报
    号召加强推广基本建设先进经验
    【本报讯】目前东北各基本建设单位推广先进经验的工作正在开展，但有些省市行动迟缓，还未订出推广先进经验的具体计划，一般号召较多，但缺乏具体措施。为使推广先进经验的工作有效地进行，东北基本建设先进经验推广委员会在最近发出了关于加强推广先进经验保证全面完成建设任务的通报，指示各地做好以下几件工作：
    第一、加强推广先进经验的领导，特别是要使领导干部认识到推广先进经验是提高劳动生产率、提高技术、保证质量、完成基本建设任务、加速国家工业化的根本方法，也是贯彻劳动定额，增加工人实际工资收入最有效的办法，因此，要批判和克服各种保守思想和自满思想。要加强领导，必须要求基本建设部门的领导干部带头学习与钻研业务，了解和掌握先进经验的特点和作用，使自己成为群众中学习先进经验的榜样，真正负起组织与推广的责任；必须建立和健全领导推广先进经验的组织机构，保证推广先进经验工作得到不间断的领导。各省市凡没有建立基本建设先进经验推广委员会的，均应根据中共中央东北局的指示迅速建立起来，由党、行政、工会、青年团及企业干部、技术人员、先进生产者代表共同组成，配备适当的干部负责领导，检查、总结和推广先进经验。各公司、工地也应建立专管机构，定期总结与推广先进经验。
    第二、有领导、有计划地进行推广工作。必须根据基本建设的特点和规律，抓住工程在不同时期的关键问题，有重点、有步骤地推广各种先进经验，特别要注意推广有决定性的先进经验。如在设计方面推广“新设计标准”和“标准设计”，在机械安装方面推广“预装配”和“组合安装法”，在土木建筑施工管理方面推广“平行流水作业”、“工程任务单”，在操作方面推广“双手挤浆法”、“水平器砌砖法”等。同时要根据施工的季节抓住重点单位及薄弱环节来推广有关的先进经验。如施工准备阶段应大力推广“设计”、“地质钻探”等方面的先进经验。在进行基础工程时推广“挖土”、“混凝土浇灌”等方面的先进经验等。通报还指出：在推广先进经验的同时，要注意支持群众的各种技术改进、发明创造和合理化建议，号召职工找窍门挖潜力。先进经验发现后要及时加以审查鉴定，及时给以技术协助，及时进行奖励表扬，及时总结先进经验，采用召开“先进经验推广大会”、“表演会”、“展览会”，举行“同工种的竞赛”等办法来推广先进经验。有苏联专家的单位，必须充分发动与组织全体职工，认真贯彻执行苏联专家建议，没有苏联专家的地方，也应大力组织学习与推广苏联先进经验。
    第三、加强政治工作，加强职工的思想教育。克服工人及职员中各种保守思想和顾虑，充分发动群众，发动工人与技术人员密切合作，使理论与实际相结合，使推广先进经验成为群众自觉的行动。通过组织表演、参观、介绍先进人物、先进思想，和好坏的对比、新旧思想对照等方法进行教育。同时，要加强宣传鼓动工作，充分利用各种有效的宣传工具，运用黑板报、漫画、光荣榜、先进经验推广站、广播站，有系统地宣传先进人物、先进思想及各种先进经验。领导干部要深入现场，及时发现萌芽的先进经验，予以协助，并重点培养典型小组及先进人物，提高其政治、技术水平，使其成为推广先进经验的骨干，在有了比较成熟的先进经验后，再全面推广。
    第四、推广先进经验必须与当前中心工作结合，具体地说，就是要与贯彻责任制、加强技术管理、加强劳动纪律教育相结合，绝对不能孤立地进行。如在贯彻责任制时，必须贯彻学习苏联与推广先进经验的责任制，及时推广贯彻责任制中的先进经验，加强技术管理，必须把成熟的先进经验纳入技术操作规程，教育全体职工切实遵守，特别要注意推广提高质量、提高技术方面的先进经验。加强劳动纪律教育，也必须和培养先进人物，树立先进思想，介绍先进经验，改善职工福利问题相结合。在推广过程中，必须加强行政管理，解决推广先进经验后的各种具体问题，如改进劳动组织，保证工具材料供应、生产平衡，调整劳动定额及改善工资福利问题等。
    通报最后要求各级领导干部要亲自负责，反对官僚主义、形式主义的领导作风，认真贯彻中共中央东北局城市工作会议和基本建设会议的精神。在各地先进经验推广委员会的统一计划下，党、行政、工会、青年团必须密切配合，具体分工。中共党的组织要及时督促检查，加强对推广先进经验工作的领导。
