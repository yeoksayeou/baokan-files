Xinhua News Agency, Washington, September 29th: Protracted negotiations between the United States and the Franco fascist government of Spain culminated in the formal signing of the aggressive US-Spanish military agreement on September 26th.

According to reports, the agreement consists of three parts. One stipulates that the United States can establish and use military facilities in Spain, and the other two stipulate that the United States will provide Spain with military supplies and military-related so-called economic and technical "assistance." Under these agreements, the United States will maintain air force bases in Madrid, Barcelona, Seville, and other regions. The US Sixth Fleet will establish naval bases in Cadiz, Cartagena, and other ports. The United States will station troops permanently at these bases and send two military delegations to Spain to implement supply plans and coordinate the two countries' military plans.

According to a statement from the State Department, negotiations for the military agreement between the United States and Franco's Spain began in April of last year. In fact, as early as March 1951, the United States dispatched a new ambassador to Spain to Madrid, whose primary task was to discuss the possibility of drawing fascist Spain into the so-called Western military alliance. Shortly afterward, the late US Chief of Naval Operations, Sherman, personally went to Madrid for specific discussions.

Due to the strong aversion of Britain, France, and the American people to the Franco regime, the US government initially kept its collusion secret, and the State Department repeatedly denied the negotiation of an agreement.

The formal conclusion of a military agreement between the United States and Spain is another step taken by the United States in preparing for a new war of aggression in Western Europe, concurrent with the revival of West German militarist forces. It proves that US imperialism has no intention of easing international tensions. But, as progressive public opinion pointed out early in the US-Spanish collusion, the fact that the United States finally formed an alliance with Franco is evidence of the weakness of US imperialism and its unstable position in Western Europe.

At the same time, this measure by the United States aims to strengthen its control over the Eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean, in order to weaken the strategic position of Britain and France there. It is well known that, under US instigation, Franco has already demanded that he acquire Gibraltar, the Western Mediterranean fortress currently in British hands. Although the ruling groups in Britain and France are angry but dare not speak out against this US practice, the contradictions between the US and Britain and between the US and France are bound to intensify due to the threat of American power in this strategic region to their interests.

Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, September 28th (TASS): Some Swedish bourgeois newspapers have severely criticized the military agreement concluded between the United States and Franco's Spain.

"Morgenbladet" (Morning News) said: "The only criterion on which the United States bases its choice of allies is the extent to which these allies can contribute as an aid in the struggle against communism. As far as the United States is concerned, even though this ally is a totalitarian fascist state, it doesn't matter when compared to the number of troops the country can provide and the number of suitable military bases it can grant."

"Aftonbladet" (Evening News) pointed out that the military agreement between the United States and Franco's Spain "will only cause unease among the Western European members of the Atlantic bloc."

"Expressen" (The Express) said that the US and Franco's military collusion "will further strengthen anti-American sentiment in Europe and Asia."

    美西签订军事经济双边协定
    瑞典报纸抨击美西狼狈为奸
    【新华社二十九日讯】华盛顿消息：美国和西班牙佛朗哥法西斯政府谈判已久的侵略性美西军事协定，在本月二十六日正式签字。
    据报纸报道，协定共有三个，一个规定美国得在西班牙建立和使用军事设备，另外两个规定美国以军事供应及军事性的所谓经济、技术“援助”给予西班牙。根据这些协定，美国将在马德里、巴塞罗那，塞维尔和其他地区保有空军基地。美国第六舰队将在加的斯、喀他亨那和其他港口建立海军基地。美国将在这些基地上常驻军队。美国并将在西班牙驻派两个军事代表团，负责实施供应计划和统一两国的军事计划。
    美国和佛朗哥西班牙之间的军事协定谈判，按照国务院的声明，从去年四月就已开始。事实上，早在一九五一年三月，美国就派遣新任驻西班牙大使赴马德里，他首要的任务就是讨论把法西斯西班牙拉入所谓西方军事联盟的可能性。不久，美国已故的海军作战部长薛尔曼并亲自赴马德里进行具体商谈。
    由于英、法以及美国国内人民对佛朗哥政权的强烈憎恶，美国政府起初曾对这种勾搭讳莫如深，国务院并曾一再否认谈判成立协定的事情。
    美国与西班牙正式缔结军事协定，是美国在复活西德军国主义势力的同时，在西欧准备新侵略战争的又一个步骤。它证明美帝国主义无意缓和国际局势。但是如进步舆论早在美西勾结之初就已指出的，美国终至于和佛朗哥结成联盟，正是美帝国主义没有力量和它在西欧的地位不稳的证据。
    同时，美国这一措施，目的还在加强美国对东大西洋及地中海的控制，以削弱英法在那里的战略地位。大家知道，佛朗哥在美国的怂恿之下，已经提出了要取得现在英国手中的地中海西部要塞直布罗陀的要求。尽管英法目前统治集团对美国这一作法敢怒而不敢言，但美英与美法之间的矛盾，势必因美国势力在这一战略地区对它们利益的威胁而加剧。
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社斯德哥尔摩二十八日讯：一些瑞典资产阶级报纸严厉抨击美国与佛朗哥西班牙缔结的军事协定。
    “晨报”说：“美国在选择盟友的时候所依据的唯一标准是这些盟友能作为反共斗争中的助力到什么程度。对于美国说来，这个盟友虽然是一个极权主义的法西斯国家，可是若与这个国家所能提供的军队数目、所能给予的合适的军事基地的数目一比较，也就无所谓了。”
    “新闻晚报”指出，美国与佛朗哥西班牙之间的军事协定“只会在大西洋集团的西欧成员国之间引起不安情绪”。
    “快报”说，美国与佛朗哥在军事上的狼狈为奸“将更进一步加强欧洲与亚洲的反美情绪”。
