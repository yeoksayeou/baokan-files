After the Korean armistice, the direct repatriation of prisoners of war by both sides ended on September 6. Now, all prisoners of war not directly repatriated are being transferred to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (NNRC) for custody, and explanatory and visiting work is about to begin separately. Regarding the additional regulations for the explanatory work formulated by the NNRC, our side's Major General Li Xiangchao made reasonable suggestions in a letter to Major General Thimayya of the NNRC. This is fundamentally different from the suggestion letter from Hamblen, commander of the US repatriation group. From these two different suggestions, one can clearly see two completely different attitudes towards prisoners of war and the armistice agreement.

The suggestions from the Korean and Chinese side are fully in line with the provisions of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," thereby ensuring that all prisoners of war not directly repatriated have the opportunity to exercise their right to be repatriated home and live peaceful lives. The so-called suggestions from the US side, however, are completely contrary to the provisions of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," making it impossible for the Korean and Chinese side to carry out explanatory work for prisoners of war, and in fact depriving our captured personnel who are not directly repatriated of the opportunity to freely express their desire for repatriation.

According to our suggestion, explanatory representatives should be able to conduct unrestricted collective and individual explanations and visits to all prisoners of war not directly repatriated, and the NNRC should establish sufficient collective and individual explanatory venues free from external interference. Among them, there should be forty-four venues for explaining to Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, each venue should have two exits for prisoners of war who apply for repatriation after individual explanation or who have not yet applied for repatriation to use separately. All prisoners of war who apply for repatriation should be immediately isolated and their application should be determined to be valid. At the same time, in order to ensure that every prisoner of war has the opportunity to apply for repatriation without any interference, and to ensure the safety of prisoners of war who apply for repatriation, prisoner of war camps should be set up with three types of custody locations, to separately manage prisoners of war who have applied for repatriation, prisoners of war who have not yet applied for repatriation after individual explanation, and prisoners of war who have not yet undergone individual explanation and have not applied for repatriation. As for the one representative from each of the opposing parties present during the explanation and visit, they only have the right to observe and must not interfere with the explanation work in any way; and the NNRC is also fully responsible for ensuring that the explanation work is not subject to any interference or sabotage.

People know that because all the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war not directly repatriated have been subjected to various threats, controls and persecutions of forced detention, and are still under the extreme terror and oppression of US special agents, they dare not or cannot express their will to demand repatriation. Therefore, in order to make the explanation and visit work truly effective, our above suggestions are completely reasonable and necessary, and are fully in line with the agreement of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission."

However, the so-called suggestions put forward by the US side attempt to completely destroy the "Terms of Reference" agreement, in order to achieve its sinister purpose of forcibly detaining prisoners of war. It has set up numerous traps to sabotage and cancel our explanation work.

The US side emphasizes that each explanation must be conducted in the presence of a representative of the detaining party, but the Kuomintang bandit gang's news agency has revealed that the US side will deliberately not send representatives to attend under various pretexts. This will obviously make the explanation work impossible. Not only that, the US "suggestion" also proposes that the representative of the original detaining party "has the right to interrupt the explanation on behalf of the prisoner of war." Such a suggestion is clearly an attempt to undermine Articles 7 and 8 of the "Terms of Reference," weaken the authority of the NNRC, and wantonly interfere with, obstruct, sabotage, and delay the explanation work, making it impossible for our explanation work to be completed within ninety days.

The US side proposes that "no questions can be asked" during the explanation, and the explanation work is limited to "providing explanations to inquiries"; and the prisoners of war have the right to "remain silent." In this way, the US side can use the special agents of the Li Seung-man and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs to force prisoners of war to "remain silent" when accepting explanations, or have the special agents impersonate prisoners of war to raise slanderous questions, making it impossible for our explanatory personnel to carry out explanations at all.

The US news agency revealed that the US side had already forcibly organized the prisoners of war into battalions and companies, arranged layers of special agents to control them, and "rehearsed" methods of sabotaging the explanation work. Now the so-called suggestions from the US side propose that the explanation work should be "carried out in teams," and the prisoners of war can "collectively refuse to accept explanations," and can request that the explanation work be carried out in the barracks where the prisoners of war live. This means that the US special agent organization in the prisoner of war camp will remain intact, and a few special agents can control a team of prisoners of war, and they can "collectively refuse explanation" in the name of prisoners of war, or force prisoners of war not to leave the barracks, making it impossible for our explanatory personnel to go to carry out explanation work under the disruption of the special agents.

If this "suggestion" of the US side is implemented, then Article 8 of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," which stipulates that "the countries to which the prisoners of war belong shall have the freedom and convenience... to explain their rights to all prisoners of war affiliated with that country," will completely become empty talk.

The US side is doing everything possible to prevent our captured personnel from escaping the control of US special agents and unable to individually and freely express their willingness to return to their motherland. On the one hand, the US side proposes that "asking questions about the prisoner of war's name, address, or social status, etc." is "completely beyond the authority of the explanatory personnel," so that special agents can impersonate prisoners of war and act recklessly; on the other hand, it emphasizes the "collective" activities of prisoners of war everywhere, so that they are always under the surveillance of special agents.

Past facts have proved that our captured personnel are often under the armed coercion of US special agents. The special agents have long forced prisoners of war to tattoo themselves, and use torture, massacre or various intimidation methods to threaten prisoners of war. This time, when the prisoners of war were handed over to the NNRC for custody, the US special agents mixed in with the prisoners of war had already brought axes, knives and other weapons into the camp, and were preparing to use "musical instruments," "sports equipment," and "flagpoles" as weapons to obstruct the explanation work. Recently, when our captured personnel Gui Rangpin and others successively requested repatriation, the US special agents even dared to come out and beat and coerce them in front of the NNRC custodial troops and observers from all parties. However, Article 3 of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" clearly stipulates that "violence or insults to the person of prisoners of war or their dignity or self-esteem shall not be permitted in any way or for any purpose," while the US "suggestion" is precisely to use its special agents to destroy this solemn regulation.

Hamblen, the commander of the US repatriation group, also has more absurd opinions in his letter to the NNRC. He said that the prisoners of war who have not been repatriated after ninety days, "regarded as a separate person, he will never again be an object of consideration by the NNRC or its affiliated institutions." This is a more tyrannical assertion that destroys the authority of the NNRC. Article 11 of the agreement clearly stipulates that prisoners of war who have not been repatriated after ninety days of explanation work, during the thirty-day period in which their repatriation issues are handed over to the political conference for resolution, "the NNRC shall continue to maintain custody of these prisoners of war," and they "can exercise their right to repatriation at any time and in any place." The US claim is clearly contrary to the provisions of this agreement. This is further proof that the US side intends to forcibly detain prisoners of war after using various delaying, destructive, and obstructive means to muddle through the ninety-day explanation period.

Obviously, the US suggestion is still a new trick in its plot to forcibly detain prisoners of war. The US side not only failed to fully repatriate the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who insisted on repatriation, and failed to be responsible for recovering the more than 27,000 of our captured personnel who were forcibly detained by the Li Seung-man group in violation of the agreement; but now, the US side wants to force the NNRC to accept its unreasonable suggestions, so that our captured personnel who have been transferred to the NNRC but are not directly repatriated cannot exercise their right to be repatriated either. This is absolutely intolerable.

The NNRC has the right to make decisions on the opinions of the opposing parties in accordance with its terms of reference, and to make reasonable arrangements for the explanation and visit work. There is no doubt about this, and both opposing parties should respect and assist it. However, Hamblen, the commander of the US repatriation group, in his letter of suggestion, even asserted that a plan being considered by the NNRC and the Indian custodial troops regarding arrangements for prisoners of war to exercise their right to repatriation is "unfair." He said that our captured personnel who are not directly repatriated have already made a choice as to whether they want to go home; and openly threatened that this plan considered by the NNRC is "contrary to the letter and spirit of the armistice agreement." This attitude of the US side is unreasonable. What else can this commanding attitude, which US imperialists are accustomed to using, explain other than the fact that the US side is very afraid that the NNRC's just work will be detrimental to the US sinister purpose of forcibly detaining prisoners of war?

Obviously, the US side is doing this not only to prevent the NNRC from playing the role of an institution for safeguarding the right of prisoners of war to repatriation, violating the solemn agreement on the NNRC's terms of reference; but also attempting to turn the NNRC into a tool for its forcible detention of prisoners of war, completely tearing up the agreement on the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," in order to achieve its sinister purpose of sabotaging the implementation of the Korean armistice agreement.

The entire Chinese people resolutely oppose this absurd and shameless so-called suggestion of the US side, which is deliberately intended to forcibly detain our captured personnel. In order to implement the provisions of the "Terms of Reference," the NNRC can only firmly reject this extremely absurd so-called suggestion of the US side, and adopt the reasonable suggestions put forward by the Korean and Chinese side, in order to maintain the solemn agreement of the "Terms of Reference," so that the explanation work can proceed normally, so that all prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated can freely exercise their right to be repatriated and return home to live peaceful lives as soon as possible.

### 反对美方破坏对战俘进行解释工作的阴谋

    反对美方破坏对战俘进行解释工作的阴谋
    朝鲜停战之后，双方关于战俘的直接遣返工作，已于九月六日结束；现在正把一切不直接遣返的战俘移交给中立国遣返委员会看管，并即将开始分别进行解释与访问工作。对于中立国遣返委员会制定解释工作的附加规定，我方李相朝中将在致中立国遣返委员会蒂迈雅中将的信中，提出了合理的建议。这和美方遣返组司令汉布伦的建议信是根本不同的。从这两个不同的建议，可以鲜明地看出对待战俘和对待停战协定的两种迥然不同的态度。
    朝中方面的建议，是完全符合于“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的规定的，从而就能够确切地保证一切不直接遣返的战俘有机会行使其被遣返回家过和平生活的权利；而美方的所谓建议，则是完全与“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的规定相违背，而使朝中方面对战俘的解释工作无法进行，实际上剥夺了不直接遣返的我方被俘人员自由表达其要求遣返的权利的机会。
      根据我方的建议，解释代表得向一切不直接遣返的战俘不受限制地进行集体的与个别的解释与访问，中立国遣返委员会应设立足够的不受外来干扰的集体和个人的解释场所。其中向朝中被俘人员进行解释的场所须有四十四个，每一场所应有两个出口以供个别解释后申请遣返或尚未申请遣返的战俘分别使用。对所有申请遣返之战俘应即予隔离并决定其申请之有效。同时，为了保证每一个战俘有不受任何干扰的申请遣返的机会，和保证申请遣返的战俘的安全，战俘营应分设三种看管战俘处所，将申请遣返之战俘、经个别解释后尚未提出申请遣返之战俘以及尚未经个别解释亦未提出申请遣返之战俘，分别加以看管。至于在解释与访问进行中在场的敌对双方各一名代表只有观察之权，不得以任何行动干扰解释工作之进行；而中立国遣返委员会也完全有责任保证解释工作不遭受任何干扰和破坏。
    人们知道，由于所有不直接遣返的朝中被俘人员一直受到被强迫扣留的种种威胁、控制与迫害，并且至今还在美方特务的极度恐怖和压迫之下，不敢或不能表达要求遣返的意志，所以，为使解释和访问工作真正有效，我方的上述建议是完全合理的和必要的。并且是完全与“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的协议相符合的。
    但美方所提出的所谓建议，则企图完全破坏
  “职权范围”的协议，借以达到其强迫扣留战俘的阴谋目的。它布置了破坏和取消我方解释工作的重重陷井。
    美方强调每一次的解释必须在拘留一方的代表到场时进行，但国民党匪帮的通讯社已透露，美方将以各种藉口故意不派代表出席。这显然就将使解释工作无法进行。不仅如此，美方的“建议”又提出原拘留一方的代表“得有权代表战俘使解释中断”。这样的建议明明是企图破坏“职权范围”第七第八两款，削弱中立国遣返委员会的权力，并蛮横地干涉、阻挠、破坏和拖延解释工作，使我方的解释工作无法在九十天内完成。
    美方提出在解释时绝“不能发问”，解释工作只限于“对询问提出解释”；而战俘又有“保持沉默”的权利。这样，美方就可以利用李承晚和蒋介石匪帮特务，强迫战俘在接受解释时“保持沉默”，或由特务冒充战俘提出诬蔑性的问题，使我方解释人员根本就无法进行解释。
    美方的通讯社透露，美方早已将战俘强迫编成大队、中队，布置特务层层控制，并且“演习”了如何破坏解释工作的方法。现在美方的所谓建议中提出解释工作要“分队进行”，而战俘可以“集体拒绝接受解释”，并且可以要求解释工作在战俘所住的营房内进行。这就是说，美方在战俘营中的特务组织将原封不动，任凭少数几个特务就可以控制一队战俘，由他们假冒战俘名义“集体拒绝解释”，或迫使战俘不离开营房，使我方解释人员在特务捣乱之下无法前往进行解释工作。
    如果实行美方这一“建议”，那末，“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”第八款所规定的“战俘所属国家有自由与便利……向一切依附于该所属国的战俘解释他们的权利”，就将完全变成了一句空话。
    美方千方百计地使我方被俘人员逃不出美方特务的控制，无法个别地、自由地表示其要求返回祖国的意愿。美方一方面提出“询问战俘的名字、住址或社会地位等问题”，都“完全不在解释人员的权限之内”，使特务们可以假冒战俘身分胡作非为；另一方面，又处处强调战俘的“集体”活动，使他们始终处在特务的监视之下。
    过去的事实证明，我方被俘人员是经常处在美方特务的武力胁迫之下的。特务们早已强迫战俘在身上刺字，并用酷刑、屠杀或各种恐吓手段来威胁战俘。这次当战俘们移交中立国看管时，混入战俘中的美方特务又已携带斧子、小刀等凶器进入营场，并准备以“乐器”、“体育用具”、“旗杆”等作为武器来阻挠解释工作。最近我方被俘人员贵让品等先后要求遣返时，美方特务甚至敢于当着中立国看管部队以及各方观察人员的面前，追出来殴打、胁迫他们。但是“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”第三款明白规定：“不得允许以任何方式或为任何目的，对战俘人身施以暴力或侮辱其尊严或自尊”，而美方“建议”恰恰就是要利用其特务来破坏这一庄严的规定。
    美方遣返组司令汉布伦写给中立国遣返委员会的信中，还有更荒谬的意见。他说：在九十天后尚未遣返的战俘，“作为一个单独的人看待，他将永远不能再成为中立国遣返委员会或它的附属机构的一个被考虑的对象”了。这是更横暴地破坏中立国遣返委员会职权的狂妄主张。协定第十一款中明文规定，九十天解释工作之后尚未遣返的战俘，在他们的遣返问题交由政治会议解决的三十天期间，“中立国遣返委员会应继续保持对这些战俘的看管”，他们“无论在任何时候和任何地方”都能行使其遣返权利。美方的主张显然是和这个协议的规定相违背的。这是美方企图在用种种拖延、破坏、阻挠的手段混过九十天的解释时间以后，把战俘强制扣留下来的又一证明。
    显然地，美方的建议依然是它强迫扣留战俘阴谋的花样翻新。美方不仅没有全部遣返坚持遣返的朝中被俘人员，没有负责追回被李承晚集团破坏协议强迫扣留的二万七千余名我方被俘人员；而且，现在，美方又想强迫中立国遣返委员会接受其不合理建议，使业已移交中立国遣返委员会的不直接遣返的我方被俘人员也无法行使他们被遣返的权利。这是绝对不能容忍的。
    中立国遣返委员会有权根据它的职权范围就敌对双方的意见作出决定，对解释和访问工作进行合理的安排，这是毫无疑义的，敌对双方都应予以尊重和协助。但美方遣返组司令汉布伦在它的建议信中，竟扬言中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队人员开始考虑的关于安排战俘行使遣返权利的一种计划，是“不公平的”。他说什么不直接遣返的我方被俘人员对他们是否要回家早已作出了选择；并公然威胁说中立国遣返委员会考虑的这个计划，是“和停战协定所规定的文字和精神相违背的”。美方这种态度是毫无道理的。美帝国主义者惯于使用的这种发号施令的态度，除了暴露出美方十分害怕中立国遣返委员会进行它的公正的工作会不利于美方强迫扣留战俘的阴谋目的之外，还能说明什么呢？
    显然，美方这种作法，不仅是要使中立国遣返委员会不能起维护战俘遣返权利机构的作用，违背了中立国遣返委员会的职权范围的庄严协议；而且是企图把中立国遣返委员会变成它强迫扣留战俘的工具，完全撕毁“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的协议，以达到它破坏朝鲜停战协定实施的罪恶目的。
    全中国人民坚决反对美方这一荒谬无耻、蓄意强迫扣留我方被俘人员的所谓建议。中立国遣返委员会为了实施“职权范围”的规定，只有坚决拒绝美方这个极端荒谬的所谓建议，而采纳朝中方面所提出的合理建议，才能维护“职权范围”的庄严协定，从而使解释工作得以正常进行，使一切不直接遣返的战俘能够自由行使其被遣返的权利，早日回家过和平的生活。
