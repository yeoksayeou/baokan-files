Xinhua News Agency, September 9th dispatch: According to a TASS report from Berlin on the 8th: The German News Agency reports that Otto Nuschke, Chairman of the German Christian Democratic Union and Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, exposed the nature of the West German Federal Assembly elections, which were conducted using terror and oppression against voters, in a speech at a meeting in Köpenick District (Berlin Democratic District). Otto Nuschke emphasized that Adenauer used the 40 million marks donated to him by the concerns and cartels to mislead voters. Nuschke pointed out that all peace-loving patriotic forces in West Germany are being suppressed. Otto Nuschke warned of the fascist danger in West Germany. He said that the Christian Democratic Union's list of candidates is filled with Nazi generals and well-known Nazis who have joined the Christian Democratic Union.

Xinhua News Agency, September 9th dispatch: According to a TASS report from Berlin on the 8th: Berlin democratic newspapers, in news reports from Bonn and in editorials, emphasized that the West German Federal Assembly elections, both in the preparatory stage and in the voting stage, were conducted under the intimidation of residents, the adoption of terrorist means, and the open use of pressure and intervention by foreign occupiers. German democratic newspapers gave the Bonn Federal Assembly elections the name: "American Elections held in West Germany."

"Neues Deutschland" pointed out: "West Germany has elected the worst Federal Assembly," and also pointed out the growing danger of fascism and revanchism. "Neues Deutschland" wrote that a dangerous situation has been created for West Germany because the Adenauer group is the main base of militarism and revanchism. Undoubtedly, American arms magnates and West German revanchists, together with military industrialists, are trying to use the election results to quickly turn West Germany into a military bridgehead for a new world war. The newspaper emphasized that although Adenauer obtained some votes, it should not be assumed that this indicates that voters agree with militarism and war policies.

The central organ of the German Christian Democratic Union, "Neue Zeit," reported on the Federal Assembly elections under the title "Elections in the American Style." The central organ of the German Free Democratic Party, "Morgenpost," commented on the West German Federal Assembly elections, writing: Adenauer must not be allowed to use the election results to throw West Germany onto a path of disaster. All forces wishing to reach an agreement should unite to jointly save peace and democracy.

Xinhua News Agency, September 9th dispatch: TASS Berlin, 8th dispatch: The West German German News Agency reported the final materials of the Federal Assembly election results. According to these materials, Adenauer's Christian Democratic Union—Christian Social Union won 244 seats, the Social Democratic Party won 150 seats, the reactionary bourgeois "Free Democratic Party" which joined the government group won 48 seats, the third party in the Bonn government alliance—the nationalist "German Party" won 15 seats, the "All-German Bloc" (the party of German returnees) won 27 seats, and the Catholic bourgeois "Centre Party" won 3 seats. A total of 487 seats. It is known that according to the Bonn election law, 484 members should be elected to the Federal Assembly. However, according to this complex and chaotic election law, the number of members may also increase during the election process. As a result, a resolution to increase the Federal Assembly to 487 seats was passed during the vote count, and as a result, Adenauer's Christian Democratic Union obtained two additional seats, and the "German Party" obtained one additional seat.

    德国基督教民主联盟主席努舍克
    痛斥阿登纳使用恐怖手段压制爱国力量
    【新华社九日讯】据塔斯社柏林八日讯：据德意志通讯社报道，德国基督教民主联盟主席、德意志民主共和国副总理奥托·努舍克在可本尼克区
    （柏林民主区）的一个会议上发言时，揭穿了在对选民使用恐怖手段和压迫的情况下所进行的西德联邦议院选举的性质。奥托·努舍克着重说，阿登纳借着康采恩和卡特尔捐助给他的四千万马克来迷惑选民。努舍克指出，西德一切爱好和平的爱国力量都受到压制。奥托·努舍克对西德的法西斯危险发出警告。他说，基督教民主联盟的候选人名单中，充满了加入基督教民主联盟的纳粹将军和著名的纳粹分子。
    【新华社九日讯】据塔斯社柏林八日讯：柏林民主报纸所刊登的波恩消息以及社论都着重说：西德联邦议院的选举，无论在准备阶段或是投票阶段，都是在恫吓居民和采取恐怖手段的情况下，以及外国占领者公开使用压力和干预的情况下进行的。德国民主报纸给波恩联邦议院的选举起了这么一个名字：“在西德举行的美国选举”。
    “新德意志报”指出：“西德选出了最坏的联邦议院”，同时指出法西斯主义和复仇主义的危险在加强。“新德意志报”写道，对于西德来说，已经造成了危险的情况，因为阿登纳集团就是军国主义和复仇主义的大本营。无容置疑，美国军火大王和西德复仇主义者会同军事工业家，企图利用选举的结果尽速把西德变为新的世界大战的军事桥头堡。报纸着重说，阿登纳虽获得了那么一些选票，但无论如何，决不能认为这就表示选民同意军国主义和战争政策。
    德国基督教民主联盟中央机关报“新时报”以“按照美国方式的选举”为题报道了联邦议院的选举消息。德国自由民主党中央机关报“晨报”评论西德联邦议院选举时写道：决不能容许阿登纳利用选举结果把西德投入灾难的道路上去。一切愿望达成协议的力量，应当联合起来共同拯救和平与民主。
    【新华社九日讯】塔斯社柏林八日讯：西德德意志新闻社报道联邦议院选举结果的最后材料。根据这些材料，阿登纳的基督教民主联盟—基督教社会联盟获得二百四十四席，社会民主党获得一百五十席，加入政府集团的反动资产阶级“自由民主党”获得四十八席，波恩政府联盟的第三个党——国家主义的“德意志党”获得十五席，“全德集团”
    （德国移居回国者的党）获得二十七席，天主教资产阶级的“中央党”获得三席。总共为四百八十七席。大家知道，根据波恩选举法应当有四百八十四名议员选入联邦议院。但是按照这个复杂而紊乱的选举法，在选举过程中议员人数也可能增加。结果，在计票时通过了关于联邦议院增加到四百八十七议席的决议，因而，阿登纳的基督教民主联盟获得两个补充席，“德意志党”获得一个补充席。
