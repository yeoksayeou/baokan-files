Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 7th. Sixty-six state-owned and local state-owned factories in Harbin are currently launching labor emulation drives, striving to comprehensively overfulfill this year's national production plan. Seven factories, including the State-owned No. 10 Machinery Factory and the State-owned Harbin Woolen Mill, which started the emulation drive earlier, have already mobilized their employees and determined their emulation goals, and are preparing to further mobilize the masses of employees for discussion. Most factories, such as the State-owned No. 4 Electrical Factory and the State-owned Harbin Flax Factory, are currently examining and summarizing the implementation of the production plan for the past eight months, the implementation of various technical and economic norms stipulated by the state, the production and sales situation, and the promotion of advanced experiences, in order to identify key issues in production as data for the emulation goals.

Before launching the emulation drive in the factories of Harbin, the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions successively convened city-wide mobilization meetings of factory cadres on August 26th and 28th to arrange the emulation work. Therefore, the emulation requirements put forward by the factories are relatively clear and practical. For example, the No. 3 workshop of the State-owned No. 10 Machinery Factory used to produce nineteen kinds of products. In this emulation drive, they determined a 20% production increase plan for four major products based on the supply of raw materials, product sales, and the urgent needs of national construction. According to the need to improve product quality, the Harbin Woolen Mill plans to mobilize employees to first solve seven quality problems such as luster, dyeing, and burrs of jacquard blankets and woolen cloth; on the basis of quality improvement, they will then increase production according to the needs of people's lives. The Harbin Leather Factory has decided to promote the advanced experience of the Soviet Zhen Darova to ensure quality in the emulation drive, reduce rework of cowhide and leather shoes, and increase production and savings of 4 billion yuan for the country. Some factories that are preparing for the emulation drive have discovered many problems that urgently need to be improved due to in-depth inspections of various aspects. When the State-owned No. 4 Electrical Factory inspected the warehouse, it found that eight tons of various types of silicon steel sheets, which the design department and workshop had unnecessarily made in the past, were piled up in the warehouse. Therefore, they plan to control the quota of raw material supply with a system. In this way, the use of silicon steel sheets can save more than 2 billion yuan in value by the end of the year.

    争取全面超额完成今年国家生产计划
    哈尔滨市各工厂开展劳动竞赛
    【新华社哈尔滨七日电】哈尔滨市有六十六个国营和地方国营工厂正在展开劳动竞赛，争取全面超额完成今年的国家生产计划。竞赛开展较早的国营机械十厂和国营哈尔滨毛织厂等七个工厂，已向职工进行了动员，并确定了竞赛奋斗目标，准备进一步发动职工群众讨论。国营电工四厂、国营哈尔滨亚麻厂等大部分工厂，目前正检查和总结过去八个月生产计划的执行情况、国家规定的各项技术经济定额贯彻情况、产销情况和先进经验的推广情况，以便找出生产中的关键问题，作为竞赛的奋斗目标的资料。
    哈尔滨市各工厂在开展竞赛以前，中共哈尔滨市委会和市总工会在八月二十六日和二十八日，曾先后召开全市工厂干部动员大会，布置了竞赛工作，因此各厂提出的竞赛要求都比较明确和切合实际。如国营机械十厂第三车间过去生产十九种产品，这次开展竞赛中，他们根据原材料供应和产品销路以及国家建设的迫切需要情况，确定了四种主要产品增产百分之二十的增产计划。哈尔滨毛织厂根据产品质量需要提高的情况，计划发动职工首先解决提花毯和呢绒的光泽、染色、毛刺等七个质量问题；在质量提高的基础上，再根据人民生活需要进行增产。哈尔滨皮革厂确定在竞赛中通过推广苏联真大罗娃保证质量的先进经验，减少牛皮和皮鞋的返工品，为国家增产节约四十亿元。有些正在进行竞赛准备工作的工厂，由于对各方面的情况作了深入检查，已发现不少亟须改进的问题。国营电工四厂检查仓库时，发现过去设计部门和车间不必要多做的各式矽钢片，有八吨堆积在仓库里。因此，他们计划在原材料供应定额上，用制度加以控制。这样，矽钢片的使用，到年底可以节约价值二十多亿元。
