Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 5th: According to reports from Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war repatriated from the US POW camp in Busan: The US POW camp authorities and Taiwanese Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents are plotting a huge conspiracy among the Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated, attempting to obstruct and sabotage the implementation of the POW agreement, in order to achieve their goal of continuing to forcibly detain POWs.

According to these returnees, since the news spread that POWs not directly repatriated would be handed over to neutral nations' troops for custody, the US POW camp authorities in Busan suddenly became busy. Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents and the heads of various detention camps, and squadron leaders have continuously attended meetings at the US military police headquarters for several days. Since the beginning of July, the US side has forced POWs who had already been tattooed to get tattooed again. The POWs had previously been forced to tattoo the four characters "Oppose Communism and Resist Russia" on their arms, and now they are being tattooed with reactionary characters such as "Resolutely Oppose Communism" and "Oppose Communism to the End" and the Kuomintang party emblem on their arms, chests, and backs. Those who refuse to get tattooed are subjected to beatings and even murder. POWs Wang Kang and Yang Jie-fu firmly refused to get tattooed and were beaten black and blue by Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents Wang Qian and Hu Zhengming. Wang Kang's leg was broken and he was spitting blood, but they still refused to get tattooed. On June 28th, Wang Kang and Yang Jie-fu were talking about returning to their country when they were overheard by Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents Wang Qian and Hu Zhengming. That night, under the direction of the US POW camp authorities, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents strangled Wang Kang and Yang Jie-fu to death, and hung their bodies on the beams, then declared that they had committed suicide by hanging because they were unwilling to be handed over to neutral nations' troops and were afraid of returning to the mainland. In addition, Kuomintang special agents have newly established special agent organizations such as the so-called "Three Principles of the People Anti-Communist Youth National Salvation Corps" and "POW Autonomous Committee" in the POW camp, and formulated so-called "Eight Disciplines" prohibiting POWs from acting together in groups of three or talking together in groups of two, further intensifying the reign of terror over the POWs.

These returnees said that on July 19th, the Busan US Military Police Headquarters summoned the heads of various detention camps to a day-long meeting, and the next day the various detention camps summoned the squadron leaders and squad leaders to a day-long meeting. The content of the meetings was kept secret, but from their mutual conversations, the POWs knew that they were discussing what would happen after the POWs were handed over to the neutral nations' troops for custody. Then, the US openly instigated the POWs to seize the weapons of the neutral nations' custodial forces and then flee to South Korea. At 5:00 p.m. on July 22nd, a US colonel, about forty years old, gathered more than 300 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who were not directly repatriated from the various detention camps in Busan in the plaza next to the seventh detention camp to speak, with a Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agent known as "Mr. Fang" acting as interpreter. This US colonel said to the POWs: "Soon you will be handed over to the neutral nations' troops for custody, but the United Nations forces will still protect you and send people to go with you, without breaking up your organization; the neutral nations' troops are carrying only light weapons, you can seize their weapons and run out. But we are not responsible if a small number of people are killed, and if a large number of people run out, we will assist you."

These returnees said that since this US colonel spoke, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents have been even more rampant in carrying out activities among the POWs. That same evening, Yue Tong, the head of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents in the fourth detention camp, summoned the POWs to a meeting, asking everyone to discuss what to do after the POWs were handed over to the neutral nations for custody and how to deal with the explanation representatives from the Korean and Chinese sides. He instigated the POWs to say that if the representatives from the Korean and Chinese sides come, kill them if you have the opportunity, and the United Nations forces will be responsible for the killings; when a general meeting is to be held, everyone should feign illness and sleep, and not be allowed to listen; if you are called to a meeting, everyone should make a noisy ruckus, sing, shout slogans, and loudly scold, so that the explanation work cannot be carried out. When the Korean and Chinese representatives want to conduct individual interviews, no one is allowed to tell their real name or talk about serious matters. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents are also preparing to organize special agent elements to impersonate POWs to accept individual interviews from the Korean and Chinese explanation representatives. They are also preparing to organize all the special agent elements and, after the explanation work begins, intensify terrorist activities to prevent the POWs from approaching the explanation representatives. The returnees all said that many Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents have already received murderous blades, and they are threatening the POWs everywhere with knives, saying: Whoever dares to tell the Korean and Chinese representatives that they are willing to return to the mainland will be killed.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 7th: According to information obtained here: With the support and assistance of the US military authorities, the Chiang Kai-shek gang has recently secretly instructed Chen Jianzhong, the head of the special agents sent to the US POW camps, to plot a larger-scale conspiracy to sabotage the armistice agreement in order to forcibly detain Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war. In the secret instructions, the Chiang Kai-shek gang ordered Chen Jianzhong: to request the United Nations forces and the Syngman Rhee bandit gang to forcibly detain the POWs in the name of "release," and to request that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated be sent to Taiwan. The Chiang Kai-shek gang also ordered Chen Jianzhong to try to sabotage the armistice agreement, oppose Poland and Czechoslovakia as members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and conspire to provoke neutral countries such as India, Sweden, and Switzerland to conduct propaganda slandering the Korean and Chinese sides. The Chiang Kai-shek gang also ordered Chen Jianzhong to use violence to persecute the staff sent by the Korean and Chinese sides to the POW camps under the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and even assassinate them. In order to guide and assist the Chiang Kai-shek special agents in planning this evil activity, the Chiang Kai-shek gang secretly dispatched Wang Dongyuan, the Chiang Kai-shek's agent stationed in South Korea, to the POW camp on Jeju Island where Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war are detained, to conduct activities on August 15th.

The Chiang Kai-shek gang's recent open dispatch of the so-called delegation led by special agent head Fang Zhi to the US POW camps on Jeju Island and Busan is also obviously to urge and assist the Chiang Kai-shek special agents in the POW camps to intensify this lawless evil conspiracy to forcibly detain POWs. News has it that this group of Chiang Kai-shek special agent heads has completed the planning of sabotage activities in the POW camps on Jeju Island and Busan, and has arrived in Tokyo and Seoul on September 5th respectively, to continue discussing the implementation of this evil conspiracy with the US military authorities and the Syngman Rhee bandit gang. News has it that after Fang Zhi and the other four special agent heads arrived in Seoul, they have held discussions with the Syngman Rhee bandit's Minister of National Defense and Minister of Internal Affairs. They will go to Tokyo for activities in the coming days. Another special agent head, Wei Jingmeng, has already arrived in Tokyo from Busan by plane.

News has it that when Chiang Kai-shek special agent head Fang Zhi was conducting activities in Busan, he had already made two arrogant demands to McGall, the US POW camp commander, on behalf of the Chiang Kai-shek special agents in the POW camp, aimed at sabotaging the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and forcibly detaining POWs. He demanded that the US military authorities interfere with and sabotage the authority and work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission under the pretext of guaranteeing the so-called "safety" of the POWs. He also demanded that after the POWs are transferred to the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the Chiang Kai-shek special agents be allowed to maintain their original special agent organizations so that they can continue to control and persecute the POWs. News has it that McGall has openly violated the agreement on POWs in the armistice agreement and agreed to this arrogant demand of the Chiang Kai-shek special agents. McGall agreed that "when the communist side launches an armed attack on these Chinese POWs or the Indian troops have persecutory behavior, the United Nations Command will take all necessary measures." McGall also agreed that the Chiang Kai-shek special agents' special agent organizations "should be maintained." Obviously, this is to prepare for the Chiang Kai-shek special agents to create various sabotage incidents after the POWs are transferred to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.

    美方利用蒋匪特务在不直接遣返的战俘中进行恐怖活动
    阴谋大规模扣留我志愿军被俘人员
    【新华社开城五日电】据由釜山美方战俘营遣返归来的中国人民志愿军被俘人员报告：美方战俘营当局和台湾蒋匪特务，正在不直接遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员中策划一个巨大的阴谋，企图阻挠和破坏关于战俘问题协议的实施，以达到其继续强迫扣留战俘的目的。
    据这些归来人员说，自从要将不直接遣返的战俘交给中立国军队看管的消息传出以后，釜山美方战俘营当局便突然忙碌起来。蒋匪特务及各收容所大队长、中队长都连续到美军宪兵司令部开了几天会。自七月初开始，美方又强迫已经刺了字的战俘再次进行刺字。战俘们过去在手臂上被迫刺过“反共抗俄”四个字，现在又在手臂、胸前和背上刺上“决死反共”、“反共到底”等反动字样和国民党党徽。拒绝刺字的人就要遭到毒打甚至谋害。战俘王康和杨介甫两人坚决拒绝刺字，被蒋匪特务王谦、胡正明打得遍体鳞伤，王康的腿被打断了，口中直冒鲜血，但他们还是拒绝刺字。六月二十八日，王康和杨介甫二人在一起谈论回国的事情，被蒋匪特务王谦、胡正明听见。当晚，蒋匪特务就在美方战俘营当局指使下将王康和杨介甫两人活活勒死，并把他们的尸首吊到梁上，然后宣称他们是因不愿交给中立国军队看管，怕回大陆而上吊自杀的。此外，国民党特务并在战俘营里新成立了所谓“三民主义反共青年救国团”、“战俘自治委员会”等特务组织，定出所谓“八大纪律”，不准战俘三人在一起行动，两人在一起谈话，更加加紧对战俘的恐怖统治。
    这些归来人员说，七月十九日，釜山美军宪兵司令部召集各收容所大队长开了一天会，第二天各收容所又召集中队长、小队长开了一天会。会议内容都秘而不宣，但从他们互相言谈中，战俘们知道是讨论战俘交给中立国军队看管以后的事情。接着，美方公开策动战俘夺取中立国看管部队的武器，然后逃往南朝鲜。七月二十二日下午五点钟，一个年约四十多岁的美军上校，把釜山各收容所中三百多名不直接遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员，集合在第七收容所旁边的广场上讲话，由一个被称为“方先生”的蒋匪特务作翻译。这个美军上校对战俘们说：“不久你们就要交给中立国军队看管了，但联合国军仍将保护你们，并派人和你们一起去，不拆散你们的编制；中立国军队带的都是轻武器，你们可以夺取他们的武器跑出来。但人少了被打死我们不负责，人多了跑出来，我们接济你们。”
    这些归来人员说，自从这个美军上校讲话以后，蒋匪特务就在战俘中更加猖狂地进行活动。当天晚上，第四收容所蒋匪特务头子岳通便召集战俘们开会，要大家讨论战俘交给中立国看管后怎么办，怎样对付朝中方面的解释代表。他教唆战俘们说，朝中方面代表来了，有机会就打死他们，打死人由联合国军负责；要开大会时，大家都装病睡觉，不准去听；如果叫去开会，大家就乱吵乱闹，唱歌，喊口号、大声辱骂，使解释工作无法进行。朝中代表要进行个别访问时，谁都不准告诉真名字，不准谈正经事。蒋匪特务还准备组织特务分子冒名顶替战俘，去接受朝中解释代表的个别访问。他们还准备把所有的特务分子组织起来，在解释工作开始后，加紧恐怖活动，阻止战俘们接近解释代表。归来人员们都说，许多蒋匪特务已经领到杀人利刃，他们拿着刀到处威胁战俘说：谁敢对朝中代表说愿回大陆，就杀死谁。
    【新华社开城七日电】据此间获悉：在美军当局的支持和协助下，蒋匪帮最近已秘密指令派去美方战俘营的特务头子陈建中，策划更大规模地破坏停战协定的阴谋，以强迫扣留中国人民志愿军被俘人员。蒋匪帮在秘密指令中命令陈建中：要求联合国军和李承晚匪帮尽速以“释放”名义强迫扣留战俘，并且要求将不直接遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员送到台湾去。蒋匪帮还命令陈建中设法破坏停战协定，反对波兰、捷克斯洛伐克为中立国遣返委员会的委员，并且阴谋挑拨印度、瑞典、瑞士等中立国家进行诬蔑朝中方面的宣传。蒋匪帮并命令陈建中以暴力迫害朝中方面派去中立国遣返委员会看管下的战俘营的工作人员，甚至对他们进行暗杀。为了指导和协助蒋匪特务策划这一罪恶活动，蒋匪帮在八月十五日并曾秘密派遣蒋匪驻南朝鲜的代理人王东原，到济州岛拘禁中国人民志愿军被俘人员的战俘营去进行活动。
    蒋匪帮最近公开派遣由特务头子方治率领的所谓代表团到济州岛和釜山的美方战俘营去，显然也是为了督促和协助战俘营内的蒋匪特务，加紧进行这种无法无天的强迫扣留战俘的罪恶阴谋。有消息说，这批蒋匪特务头子在济州岛和釜山战俘营内策划破坏活动已经完毕，并且已在九月五日分别到达东京和汉城，继续与美军当局和李承晚匪帮商量这个罪恶阴谋的实施。消息说，方治等四个特务头子到达汉城以后，已经与李匪国防部长官，内务部长官等进行商谈。他们日内并将去东京进行活动。另一个特务头子魏景蒙已从釜山乘飞机先行到达东京。
    有消息说，蒋匪特务头子方治在釜山进行活动时，已经代表战俘营内的蒋匪特务向美方战俘营长官麦克加尔，提出了两项破坏中立国遣返委员会工作，旨在强迫扣留战俘的狂妄要求。他要求美军当局藉口保证战俘的所谓“安全”，干涉和破坏中立国遣返委员会的职权和工作。他还要求在战俘移交给中立国遣返委员会看管以后，允许蒋匪特务保持其原有的特务组织，以便他们继续控制和迫害战俘。消息说，麦克加尔已公然违反停战协定中有关战俘的协议，答应了蒋匪特务的这种狂妄要求。麦克加尔同意蒋匪特务在所谓“共方武装进攻这些中国战俘或印度军队有迫害行为时，联合国军司令部将采取一切必要的措置”。麦克加尔并且同意蒋匪特务的特务组织“应予维持”。显然，这是为蒋匪特务在战俘移交给中立国遣返委员会以后制造各种破坏事件预作准备。
