Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 6th: Order from the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The text is as follows:

Germ warfare is the most cruel and barbaric method of warfare, violating human morality, destroying the principles of international law, and violating international conventions. American air force personnel Frank H. Schwable, Andre J. Evans Jr., Wac M. Mahurin, Roy H. Bley, John A. Osborne, John S. Quinn, Kenneth L. Enoch, Paul R. Kniss, Robert C. Rully, Howard B. Hochey Jr., David E. Penny, Bobby E. Hammer, James E. Guno Jr., Robert E. Martin, John G. Ellis Jr., Roger Warren, Winston J. Ssmanson, William L. Fornes, Charles E. Stoll, Floyd B. O'Neil, Richard G. Wass, Charles M. Curl, Warren W. Luer, George F. Brooks, Vance R. Frick, a total of twenty-five people, participated in the large-scale germ warfare conducted by the U.S. military in Korea during the Korean War.

After reviewing the confessions of the above-mentioned personnel and other evidence, the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea believes that all these confessions and other evidence have confirmed that Xu Weibuer and the other twenty-five people did commit the crime of carrying out germ warfare within the territory of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Their confessions confirmed that the U.S. government, unwilling to accept its failure in the war of aggression against Korea, had conducted special training on germ warfare methods on a large scale and had been using bacteriological weapons on a large scale since December 1951 for the purpose of slaughtering the peaceful people of Korea and the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. Xu Weibuer and the other twenty-five people participated in this brutal crime, and the circumstances were serious. They should have been punished accordingly, but considering that they were all carrying out orders from their superiors and were not the main responsible persons for planning and launching germ warfare against us, and that they were able to confess their crimes frankly after committing them, therefore, in accordance with the lenient policy of the Korean People's Army of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea towards prisoners of war, and with the approval of the Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, it has been decided to treat them leniently and exempt Xu Weibuer and the other twenty-five people from prosecution.

    朝鲜人民军总政治局发布命令
    对许威布尔等参加细菌战的战俘免予法办
    【新华社平壤六日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国朝鲜人民军总政治局命令。文如下：
    细菌战是违犯人类道德、破坏国际法原则和国际公约的最残暴、最野蛮的作战方法。美国空军人员弗兰克·H·许威布尔、小安德烈·J·爱文斯、瓦克·M·马胡林、罗伊·H·布莱、约翰·A·奥斯本、约翰·S·奎恩、凯尼斯·L·伊纳克、保罗·R·克尼斯、劳勃脱·C·鲁利、小霍华德·B·郝庆斯、戴维德·E·潘尼、鲍贝·E·汉麦、小詹姆士·E·耿诺、劳勃脱·E·马丁、小约翰·G·爱立斯、罗吉·华伦、温斯顿·J·萨梦逊、威廉·L·福恩斯、却利斯·E·史托尔、弗洛依德·B·奥尼尔、理查·G·瓦斯、查理士·M·克尔、华伦·W·勒尔、乔治·F·勃鲁克斯、凡士·R·弗立克共二十五人，于朝鲜作战期间在朝鲜境内曾参加过美军所进行的大规模的细菌战。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国朝鲜人民军总政治局在核阅了上述人员的供词及其他证据之后，认为所有这些供词及其他证据，业已证实许威布尔等二十五人确在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国境内犯有执行细菌战的罪行。他们的供词证实：美国政府为了不甘心其在侵略朝鲜战争中的失败，曾大规模地进行细菌作战方法的特别训练，并于一九五一年十二月起大规模使用以屠杀朝鲜和平人民及朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军为目的的细菌武器。该许威布尔等二十五人参加这一残暴罪行，情节重大，本应科以应得之惩罚，惟鉴于他们均系执行上级命令，尚非策划和发动对我进行细菌战的主要负责者，并且他们于犯罪后又能坦白认罪，因此，特根据朝鲜民主主义人民共和国朝鲜人民军对战俘的宽大政策，经呈准朝鲜人民军最高司令官，决予从宽处理，对许威布尔等二十五人一律免予法办。
