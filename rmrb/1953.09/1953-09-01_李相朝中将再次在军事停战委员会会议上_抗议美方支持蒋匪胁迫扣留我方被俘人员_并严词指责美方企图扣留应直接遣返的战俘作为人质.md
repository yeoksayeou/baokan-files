Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 31st:

    The Korean Military Armistice Commission held a meeting on August 31st.
    Chief Delegate of the Korean-Chinese side, Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao, strongly protested again at the meeting against the United Nations Command's open support and assistance to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in dispatching a large number of secret agents to the opposing side's POW camps, openly engaging in activities of coercing and detaining captured Korean-Chinese personnel. Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao demanded that the United Nations Command immediately cease such destructive activities, thoroughly eliminate all Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek secret agents operating in the United Nations Command POW camps, and bear full responsibility for all serious consequences caused by the activities of such secret agents. Chief Delegate of the United Nations Command, Major General Brian, stated that he would forward the strong protest of the Korean-Chinese side to the appropriate authorities of the United Nations Command.
    At the same meeting, Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao also sternly condemned the United Nations Command for violating international conventions, the Geneva Convention, and the provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement, publicly declaring its intention to use prisoners of war as hostages in an attempt to detain a large number of Korean-Chinese captured personnel who should be immediately and directly repatriated. Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao demanded that the United Nations Command immediately make clear whether it is prepared, in accordance with the Armistice Agreement, to repatriate to the Korean-Chinese side all Korean-Chinese captured personnel it intends to detain, including important figures among the Korean People's Army's Park Sang-hyun, Li In-cheol, Kim Tae-hoon, Shin Tae-bong, Eom Jeong-hyeop, Li Jong-jin, Li Cheol-gyun, Ro Jae-gil, etc., and the Chinese People's Volunteers' Wu Chengde, Wang Fang, Wei Lin, Li Yan, Sun Zheng-guan, Li Decai, etc., whom the opposing side has not yet repatriated.
    Major General Brian claimed that the United Nations Command would directly repatriate all Korean-Chinese captured personnel who insisted on repatriation, but did not provide a clear answer to the specific personnel repatriation issues raised by Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao. Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao pointed out that directly repatriating all prisoners of war who insisted on repatriation in accordance with the Armistice Agreement is the consistent position of the Korean-Chinese side. A clear and specific response to the specific Korean-Chinese captured personnel repatriation issues raised by the Korean-Chinese side is very important for the smooth progress of the prisoner of war repatriation work, and the Korean-Chinese side awaits a prompt response from the United Nations Command.
    The full text of Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao's strong protest at the August 31st Military Armistice Commission meeting against the United Nations Command's open support and assistance to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's large number of secret agents in carrying out activities of coercing and detaining captured Korean-Chinese personnel is as follows:
    "Regarding the United Nations Command's support and assistance to the Chinese Kuomintang reactionary remnant bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek in carrying out activities of coercing and detaining our captured personnel, I was instructed to lodge a strong protest with you on August 10th. However, your side not only did not immediately cease this behavior of undermining the Armistice Agreement and insulting our captured personnel, but also publicly declared on August 21st that your side would cooperate with the secret agent leader of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang who is active in your side's Jeju Island POW camp. On August 26th and 27th, with your side's support and assistance, the secret agent leader of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, Fang Zhi, and others openly landed on Jeju Island by remnant bandit plane, carrying a large number of so-called comfort items, including Chiang Kai-shek's photos and letters, as well as Kuomintang flags, and distributing them to our captured personnel. This is yet another serious act of undermining the Armistice Agreement by your side's blatant use of traitors of the Chinese people outside the Korean War to interfere with the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement, attempting to achieve your side's goal of forcibly detaining prisoners of war. In response, I am instructed to once again lodge a strong protest with you, demanding that your side immediately cease this destructive activity, thoroughly eliminate all Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek secret agents operating in your side's POW camps, and bear full responsibility for all serious consequences caused by the activities of such secret agents."

    李相朝中将再次在军事停战委员会会议上
    抗议美方支持蒋匪胁迫扣留我方被俘人员
    并严词指责美方企图扣留应直接遣返的战俘作为人质
    【新华社开城三十一日电】朝鲜军事停战委员会八月三十一日举行会议。
    朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将在会上再度强硬抗议联合国军司令部公开支持与协助蒋介石匪帮派遣大批特务到对方战俘营，公然进行胁迫扣留朝中被俘人员的活动。李相朝中将要求联合国军方面立即停止此种破坏活动，彻底清除在联合国军战俘营活动的一切李承晚和蒋介石的特务分子，并负担此类特务分子的活动所引起之严重后果的全部责任。联合国军方面首席委员勃里安少将表示：他将把朝中方面的强硬抗议转告联合国军适当当局。
    同日会上，李相朝中将并严词指责联合国军方面破坏国际惯例、日内瓦公约与朝鲜停战协定的规定，公开声明将以战俘作为人质企图扣留大批应立即予以直接遣返的朝中被俘人员。李相朝中将要求联合国军方面立即明确表示它是否准备按照停战协定，将它所企图扣留的全部朝中被俘人员遣返给朝中方面，包括对方至今尚未遣返的朝鲜人民军的朴相显、李仁哲、金泰勋、申泰凤、严正侠、李钟镇、李哲钧、卢在吉等和中国人民志愿军的吴成德、王芳、魏林、李彦、孙振冠、李德才等朝中被俘人员中的重要人物。
    勃里安少将声称：联合国军将直接遣返一切坚持遣返的朝中被俘人员，但对李相朝中将所具体提出的人员之遣返问题仍未作明确答复。李相朝中将乃指出：将一切坚持遣返的战俘按照停战协定予以直接遣返，是朝中方面的一贯立场，对朝中方面所具体提出的朝中被俘人员之遣返问题一切明确具体答复对于遣返战俘工作的顺利进行是非常重要的，朝中方面等待联合国军方面的迅速答复。
    李相朝中将在八月三十一日军事停战委员会上强硬抗议联合国军司令部公开支持与协助蒋匪帮的大批特务在对方战俘营进行胁迫扣留朝中被俘人员的活动之发言全文如下：
    “对于联合国军司令部支持和协助中国国民党反动残余匪首蒋介石对我方被俘人员进行胁迫扣留的活动，我曾在八月十日奉命向你提出强硬抗议，但你方不仅没有立即停止这种破坏停战协定侮辱我方被俘人员的行为，反而在八月二十一日公开声明你方将与蒋介石匪帮派到你方济州岛战俘营活动的特务首脑合作。八月二十六日与二十七日在你方支持和协助之下，蒋介石匪帮的特务首脑方治等公然乘坐残匪飞机降落济州岛，载运包括蒋匪照片和信件以及国民党旗的大批所谓慰问品向我方被俘人员分发。这是你方公然利用在朝鲜战争以外的中国人民的叛徒分子来干涉朝鲜停战协定的实施，企图达到你方强迫扣留战俘的目的的又一次严重破坏停战协定的行为。对此我奉命再次向你提出强硬抗议，要求你方立即停止此项破坏活动，彻底清除在你方战俘营活动的一切李承晚和蒋介石的特务分子，并担负此类特务分子活动所引起的严重后果的全部责任。”
