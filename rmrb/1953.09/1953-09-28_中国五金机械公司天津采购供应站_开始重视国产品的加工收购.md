    China National Hardware and Machinery Company Tianjin Purchasing and Supplying Station
    Begins to Emphasize Domestic Product Processing and Acquisition
    The China National Hardware and Machinery Company Tianjin Purchasing and Supplying Station has improved its processing and acquisition business in organizing sources of goods. In May and June of this year, the Tianjin Purchasing and Supplying Station had already begun processing and acquisition. After the efforts of the past two months, it has initially grasped the main sources of goods in Tianjin, laying a good foundation for expanding acquisition and ensuring supply.
    Initially, due to the small number of cadres in the station and the large number of foreign goods arriving, which urgently needed to be inspected and distributed, not enough attention was paid to the acquisition of domestic hardware products and market arrangements. On the other hand, after the implementation of the economic accounting system, some cadres had a one-sided economic accounting mentality of "fearing losses" and "fearing stockpiles." Therefore, their business methods were characterized by hesitation, only waiting for goods to be delivered, wanting immediate goods, fearing forward contracts, only paying attention to the market of goods circulation, but neglecting the factories that produce goods, and not emphasizing processing orders.
    Since July, under the call of the higher authorities to vigorously organize sources of goods, the station has quickly reversed its previous view of neglecting processing and acquisition. First, it supplemented and adjusted the allocation of cadres for processing and acquisition. Then, in mid-August, it held a station-wide employee meeting. Leading cadres gave clear instructions on policies and practices. Through the employees' profound self-criticism and full discussion, they thoroughly criticized the one-sided economic accounting mentality of "fearing losses" and "fearing stockpiles," recognized the importance of organizing sources of goods, thereby changing the employees' business methods, and boldly and actively expanding the scope of acquisition and processing. As of early September, the station has established ordering, consignment, and processing relationships with 106 factories, among which the materials related to capital construction, such as plumbing equipment and door and window parts, have been almost completely controlled.
    The station's ability to achieve initial success in processing and acquisition, in addition to the leadership's emphasis, the general cadres' recognition of the importance of organizing sources of goods, and the improvement of business methods, also depends on the coordination and promotion of the Party, government, labor union, and youth league organizations within the unit; the understanding of the production and sales situation in the Tianjin market; the connection with relevant departments, especially obtaining the strong support of local administrative departments and the close cooperation of the customs.
    However, the station still has shortcomings in organizing sources of goods: the scope of processing is still very narrow, and although there are many orders, there are fewer consignments. The scope of processing and acquisition has not yet been expanded to the entire supply area, but is limited to Tianjin. At the same time, the connection between internal units such as receiving and storage and pricing is not close enough. The understanding of the production and sales situation of factories and markets is not comprehensive and in-depth enough. These shortcomings must be overcome in a timely manner. (Kuàng Bóqí)

### 中国五金机械公司天津采购供应站  开始重视国产品的加工收购

    中国五金机械公司天津采购供应站
    开始重视国产品的加工收购
    中国五金机械公司天津采购供应站在组织货源中改进了加工收购业务。今年五、六月间，中国五金机械公司天津采购供应站就已开始加工收购。经过最近两月来的努力，已初步掌握天津市内的主要货源，为扩大收购保证供应打下了良好基础。
    起初，由于该站干部少，当时国外来货甚多，亟待接验分配，因而对于五金国产品的收购及市场的安排不够重视。另一方面，实行经济核算制以后，部分干部存在着“怕赔钱”“怕积压”的片面经济核算思想，因此在经营方式上表现了缩手缩脚、只知等货上门、要现货、怕进远期货，只注意到货物流动的市场，却忽视了生产货物的工厂，不重视加工订货。
    七月以来，该站在上级大力组织货源的号召下，迅速扭转了以往忽视加工收购的看法，首先对加工收购干部的配备，加以补充调整。接着在八月中旬召开了一次全站职工大会，由领导干部对政策及作法加以明确指示，通过职工们的深刻检查和充分讨论，彻底批判了“怕赔钱”“怕积压”等片面经济核算思想，认识到组织货源的重要性，从而改变了职工们的经营方式，大胆主动地扩大收购加工面。截至九月上旬止，该站已与一○六家工厂建立了订货、包销及加工关系，其中有关基本建设的物资，如水暖器材及门窗零件，已差不多全部掌握。
    该站在加工收购上所以能取得初步成绩，除了领导上的重视，一般干部认识到组织货源的重要和改善了经营方式而外，本单位党、政、工、团等组织的配合推动；对天津市场的产销情况的了解；与有关部门的联系，特别是取得当地行政部门的大力支持和海关的密切配合，也都是很重要的原因。
    但目前该站在组织货源方面，仍然存在着缺点：加工面还很窄狭，订货虽多，但包销者较少。加工收购的范围，尚未能扩及全供应区，仅限于天津市内。同时对内部各单位如接储与物价联系还不够紧密。对工厂及市场产销情况的了解还不够全面深入。这些缺点必须及时克服。　（旷伯奇）
