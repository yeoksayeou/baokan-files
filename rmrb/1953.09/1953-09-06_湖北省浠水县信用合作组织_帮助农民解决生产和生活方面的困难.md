Credit Cooperative Organizations in Xishui County, Hubei Province
Help Farmers Solve Difficulties in Production and Life

    Credit cooperative organizations in Xishui County, Hubei Province, are helping farmers in production and solving difficulties for members.

    Since Xishui County began pilot credit cooperatives in key areas in 1951, there have been thirteen credit cooperatives and two credit groups, with a total of more than 18,900 members and more than 129 million yuan in share capital.

    Most credit cooperatives and credit groups have implemented the policy of serving agricultural production when granting loans, weakening the development of rural usury. In the past two years, the Hedong Township Credit Cooperative has provided loans that enabled local farmers to purchase 45 head of cattle, 41 waterwheels, 910 pieces of farm tools, and 12,270 catties of fertilizer. It has also helped rural sideline production and solved the problem of insufficient grain rations for some farmers during production. The Qiyang District Credit Cooperative pays attention to grasping the seasonality of production when granting loans, so the problems are solved for farmers in a timely manner. Sideline loans are recovered at the end of each year to prepare for lending during the spring plowing of the following year. Wheat fertilizer loans are recovered after the wheat harvest to prepare for lending during the summer famine. Autumn fertilizer loans are recovered after the autumn harvest to prepare for lending during the winter planting. In this way, some farmers who have difficulties in production and life can obtain loans when food is scarce and will not be subjected to usury. When recovering loans, they can also handle them separately according to the specific circumstances of the farmers at that time, so they are welcomed by the farmers. Some credit cooperatives in Xishui County have adhered to the principles of "mutual benefit" and "voluntariness" when farmers join the cooperative, and have also fully promoted democracy within the cooperative, so that the credit cooperative has been consolidated and its business has developed. The credit cooperatives in Hedong and Qizhu Townships have convened member representative meetings to publicize accounts, so that members care about their cooperatives and strengthen their love of the cooperative. Some credit cooperatives also regularly conduct political and business education for their members. The broad masses of farmers have realized the benefits of credit cooperatives from specific examples, so many farmers have voluntarily joined the credit cooperatives.

    At present, it is the autumn harvest season, and farmers in Xishui County have achieved a bumper harvest. Credit cooperatives and credit groups in various places are preparing to convene member representative meetings after autumn, collect loans, absorb funds, and develop business according to their own business conditions.

    湖北省浠水县信用合作组织
    帮助农民解决生产和生活方面的困难
    湖北省浠水县各地信用合作组织扶助农民生产，解决社员困难。
    该县自一九五一年重点试办信用合作社以来，已有信用合作社十三个、信用小组两个，共计社员一万八千九百多人，股金一亿二千九百多万元。
    大部分信用合作社和信用小组在贷款时，都贯彻了为农业生产服务的方针，削弱了农村高利贷的发展。河东乡信用合作社两年来，通过贷款使当地农民购买耕牛四十五头，水车四十一部，农具九百一十件，肥料一万二千二百七十斤。并帮助了农村副业生产，同时还帮助一些农民解决了在生产时口粮不足的困难。圻阳区信用合作社在贷款时注意掌握生产的季节性，因而给农民解决问题也很及时，每年年底收回副业贷款，准备第二年春耕时贷出，麦收后收回麦肥贷款，准备在夏荒贷放，秋收后又收回秋肥贷款，准备在冬种时贷放。这样，可使一些在生产和生活上有困难的农民在青黄不接的时候，能够得到贷款，不致受到高利贷的剥削。在收回贷款时，他们也能根据农民当时的具体情况分别处理，因而受到农民的欢迎。浠水县部分信用合作社在农民入社时坚持了“互利”、“自愿”原则，在社内还充分发扬了民主，因此使信用合作社得到巩固，业务上得到发展。河东、祁主两乡的信用合作社，都召开社员代表会，公布账目，使社员关心自己的合作社，并加强社员爱社思想，有些信用合作社还经常对社员进行政治和业务教育。广大农民从具体的事例中体会到信用合作社的好处，因此很多农民都自愿地加入了信用合作社。
    目前，正值秋收季节，浠水县农民已获丰收，各地使用合作社和信用小组，正根据本身业务情况，在作秋后召开社员代表大会、清收贷款、吸取资金和开展业务等准备工作。
