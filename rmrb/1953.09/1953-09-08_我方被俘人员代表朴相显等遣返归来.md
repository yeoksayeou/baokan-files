Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 7th. Thanks to the unremitting efforts of the Korean and Chinese side, Park Sang-hyun, Wu Chengde and other representatives of the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, who had been unreasonably detained by the US side, were finally repatriated on September 6th.

At about 9:00 a.m. on the 6th, a batch of ambulances carrying our wounded and sick personnel came from the US side. Park Sang-hyun, looking haggard, stepped out of one of the ambulances. This man, who had been subjected to countless electric shocks for his persistence in the repatriation struggle, was so moved at the first moment of returning to the embrace of the Republic that he could not even speak, and tears that had not flowed for three years welled up. He said, "The enemy told me: because people all over the world already know my name, they don't dare to shoot me!"

Wu Chengde, a captured soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, stepped out of another ambulance. Wu Chengde's actual age is only in his thirties, but due to the extreme torture he suffered in the US POW camp, most of the hair on his head has fallen out, leaving only a messy circle of short hair around the edges. He was wearing a pair of shoes with a thousand patches, and people could barely recognize them as rubber shoes made in the motherland from the thin layer of rubber on the soles. During his long period of secret imprisonment by the enemy, Wu Chengde resolutely refused to wear the leather boots given to him by the enemy, and always wore these shoes from the motherland.

At 11:30, an open-top truck carried Wang Fang, Wei Lin, the chief representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war, as well as Sun Zhenguan, the deputy head of the Korean and Chinese POW delegation in the Dudd case, and others. They were singing and waving their hats from afar. As soon as the truck stopped, people surrounded it, shaking hands and shouting slogans enthusiastically. At this time, Sun Zhenguan, standing on the truck, pointed to a Volunteer Army prisoner of war lying in a nearby ambulance and shouted angrily, "Take a look! His name is Tian Chongzeng. He was severely injured for resolutely wanting to return to the motherland. This is the enemy's so-called 'respect for individual rights' nonsense!"

After getting off the truck, they were taken to tents to rest. After the nurses changed them into new clothes, Wang Fang stroked the new clothes from the motherland with infinite affection and gratitude, saying: "In the POW camp, the enemy often searched, and it was so difficult to preserve even a thread from the motherland! One comrade had a piece of cloth from the motherland, so we tore it into strips and distributed them to everyone. Each person hid the strip of cloth they received next to them, as if the motherland was by their side!"

The Volunteer Army prisoners of war who returned on the 6th asked as soon as they got off the bus, "Has Comrade Park Sang-hyun of Korea returned?" Park Sang-hyun also asked after getting off the bus, "Have Comrade Wang Fang and the others from the Volunteer Army returned?" This precious friendship between the Korean and Chinese people, forged in adversity, is unparalleled.

However, when the repatriation work on the 6th ended, people discovered that some of the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who insisted on repatriation had not been repatriated, even though the US representative had once again made a promise to repatriate them at the POW Repatriation Committee on September 5th.

### 我方被俘人员代表朴相显等遣返归来

    我方被俘人员代表朴相显等遣返归来
    【新华社开城七日电】由于朝中方面的坚持不懈的努力，被美方一直无理扣留着的朝中被俘人员的代表朴相显、吴成德等，终于在九月六日遣返归来了。
    六日上午九时左右，从美方开来了一批遣送我方伤病人员的救护车。从一辆救护车里走下来了形容憔悴的朴相显。这个为了坚持遣返斗争而受过数不清次数电刑的人，在这重回共和国怀抱的最初一刻，激动得连话也说不出来，三年没有流过的眼泪涌了出来。他说：“敌人告诉我：因为全世界人民已经晓得我的名字，所以他们不敢把我枪毙掉！”
    从另一辆救护车里下来了中国人民志愿军被俘人员吴成德。吴成德的实际年龄不过三十多岁，但由于在美方战俘营里受了极大的折磨，他头顶上的头发已经脱落大半，只剩下四周一圈杂乱的短发。他脚上穿着一双千补百缝的鞋子，人们只能从鞋底上一层薄胶皮上，勉强辨认出这是祖国制造的橡胶鞋。吴成德在被敌人长期秘密囚禁的期间，坚决拒绝穿敌人给他的皮靴，始终穿着这双祖国的鞋子。
    十一时三十分，一辆敞篷卡车载来了中国人民志愿军被俘人员的总代表王芳、魏林，以及杜德事件中的朝中战俘代表团副团长孙振冠等人。他们老远就唱着歌、挥着帽子。车子刚一停下，人们就把车子围得水泄不通，热情地向他们握手、喊口号。这时，站在车上的孙振冠，就向大家指着旁边一辆救护车里一位躺着的志愿军被俘人员，激愤地喊道：“请看一看！他叫田崇增，为了坚决要回祖国，他被打得身负重伤，这就是敌人所说的甚么‘尊重个人权利’的鬼话！”
    他们在下车后，就被送到帐篷里去休息。在护士给他们换上新衣服以后，王芳怀着无限亲切与感激的心情抚着祖国的新衣服说：“在战俘营里，敌人经常搜查，保存祖国来的一根线都是那么艰难啊！有一个同志带着一块祖国的布，我们就将它撕成布条分给大家。每人把分得的一条布藏在身边，就像祖国在自己身边一样！”
    六日回来的志愿军被俘人员一下车就问：“朝鲜的朴相显同志回来没有？”朴相显下车后也问：“志愿军的王芳同志他们回来了没有？”这种在患难中缔结起来的朝中人民间的珍贵友谊是无可比拟的。
    但是，当六日的遣接工作结束时，人们发现，还有一部分坚持遣返的朝中被俘人员没有被遣返回来，而在九月五日的战俘遣返委员会上，美方代表曾经再一次作了要予遣返的诺言的。
