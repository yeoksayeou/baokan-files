    The first National Higher Normal Education Conference, convened by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, opened in Beijing on September 28. Participants in the conference included heads of education bureaus from major administrative regions, heads of education departments and bureaus from various provinces and cities, and presidents, academic deans, and some department heads from higher normal colleges.

    The tasks of this conference are: First, to clarify the guiding principles and tasks of national higher normal education, and discuss the five-year establishment and development plan for higher normal schools; Second, to clarify the leadership relationship of higher normal schools and the division of leadership between the central and local people's governments over higher normal schools; Third, to discuss the academic system of higher normal education and the methods for training secondary school teachers; Fourth, to discuss methods for improving and cultivating teachers and curriculum compilation plans; Fifth, to determine the guiding principles, steps, and methods for teaching reform in higher normal schools; Sixth, to discuss the teaching plan (revised draft) for normal colleges and its specific implementation steps.

    Wei Que, Vice Minister of Education of the Central People's Government, pointed out at the opening of the conference: Higher normal education bears the glorious and arduous task of training secondary school teachers and educating the younger generation to build and defend the motherland. It occupies an important position in the entire educational construction and is closely related to the entire national construction. However, the current higher normal schools, whether in terms of quantity or quality, are far from meeting the needs of the country. Now the motherland has begun its first five-year construction plan and will gradually realize national industrialization in order to successfully transition to socialism. In order to closely cooperate with the national construction plan, higher normal education must obey the country's general line and, according to the general policy of "consolidation, key development, quality improvement, and steady progress" for cultural and educational work, make new arrangements.

    Zhang Xiruo, Minister of Education of the Central People's Government, made a report at the conference on "The Basic Situation and Future Guiding Principles and Tasks of National Higher Normal Education." He pointed out: Higher normal education is an important link in the entire education cause. The nature of the work of higher normal schools is to cultivate teachers, to cultivate people who set an example for the people and for our future generations, that is, the "engineers of the human soul," as everyone knows. Therefore, the quality of higher normal education directly affects the younger generation. In the past four years, higher normal education has undergone rapid recovery and has greatly developed. At present, the number of students in higher normal schools is more than double the highest level in the history of old China (1946). There are now thirty-one higher normal schools, including twenty-six normal colleges (including three normal universities) and five normal junior colleges. In addition, there are the normal department of Xinjiang Nationalities Institute, the normal college of Yanbian University, and the Department of Education of Xiamen University, which are not independently established, with a total of 39,765 students. In the past four years, higher normal education has trained tens of thousands of secondary school teachers, basically solving the demand for teachers for the development of secondary schools in recent years. Minister Zhang pointed out: In the past four years, teachers in higher normal schools have generally undergone ideological transformation, and most of them have established the idea of serving the people's education cause and are working diligently for the people's education cause. After the adjustment of departments and colleges, the vast majority of higher normal schools have been independently established, making higher normal education have a clear purpose. On the basis of the independent establishment of higher normal schools, partial adjustments of departments and subjects have been initially carried out to make it conducive to exerting teaching effectiveness and improving teaching quality. Many higher normal schools have been committed to learning from the advanced educational experience of the Soviet Union and have carried out teaching reforms to varying degrees, and have begun to accumulate some experience. Normal colleges and normal junior colleges have implemented the draft teaching plan issued by the Central Ministry of Education, which has begun to change the situation of aimless and unplanned teaching in old higher normal schools, making the teaching work of higher normal schools have a clear direction. All these achievements have laid a preliminary foundation for higher normal education and provided favorable conditions for future reform and development. However, the scale of higher normal education is far from meeting the needs of secondary school teachers, and the teaching conditions of higher normal schools cannot meet the current and future needs. The teaching reform in normal education is only a beginning; the task of this conference is to strive to solve some urgent problems that need to be solved and can be solved, and to formulate a working program for higher normal education in the future. Then Minister Zhang put forward the guiding principles, tasks, and development scale of higher normal education in the five years, the leadership relationship of higher normal schools, the academic system, the training and improvement of teachers, and the teaching reform, and other issues and preliminary opinions, submitted to the conference for discussion and research.

    第一次全国高等师范教育会议开幕
    中央人民政府教育部召开的第一次全国高等师范教育会议九月二十八日在北京开幕。参加这次会议的有各大行政区教育局、各省、市教育厅、局的负责人和各高等师范院校的院校长、教务长、部分系主任等。
    这次会议的任务是：第一，明确全国高等师范教育的方针、任务，讨论高等师范学校的五年设置和发展计划；第二，明确高等师范学校的领导关系和中央与地方人民政府对高等师范学校的领导分工问题；第三，讨论高等师范的学制及培养训练中等学校师资的办法；第四，讨论提高与培养师资的办法和教材编译方案；第五，确定高等师范学校教学改革的方针、步骤和方法；第六，讨论师范学院教学计划（修正草案）及其具体实施步骤。
    中央人民政府教育部副部长韦慤在大会开幕时指出：高等师范教育担负着培养中等学校师资，教育青年一代来建设祖国、保卫祖国的光荣而艰巨的任务，在整个教育建设中，占着重要的地位，对于整个国家建设有着密切的关系。但当前的高等师范学校，不论在数量上或质量上都远不能适应国家的需要。现在祖国已经开始了第一个五年建设计划，并要逐步实现国家工业化，以便胜利地过渡到社会主义。为了密切配合国家建设计划，高等师范教育就必须服从国家的总路线，根据文化教育工作“整顿巩固、重点发展、提高质量、稳步前进”的总方针，有一番新的安排。
    中央人民政府教育部部长张奚若在会上作了关于“全国高等师范教育的基本情况和今后方针任务”的报告。他指出：高等师范教育是全部教育事业中的一个重要环节。高等师范学校工作的性质是培养人师，培养为人民作榜样、为我们后一代作榜样的人，也就是大家所知道的人类的灵魂工程师。因此高等师范教育质量的好坏，就直接影响到青年一代。过去四年，高等师范教育经过迅速恢复，有了极大的发展。目前高等师范学校在校学生人数较旧中国历史上最高一年（一九四六年）的水平已超过一倍以上。高等师范学校现在已达三十一所，其中师范学院二十六所（内包括三所师范大学），师范专科学校五所。此外尚有未独立设置的新疆民族学院师范部，延边大学师范学院和厦门大学教育系，学生共有三万九千七百六十五人，四年来高等师范已经培养了数万中等学校的师资，基本上解决了这几年中等学校发展对师资的要求。张部长指出：四年来，高等师范的教师，一般都经过了思想改造，多数人树立了为人民教育事业服务的思想，为人民教育事业辛勤地工作着。院系调整后，极大多数高等师范学校已独立设置，使高等师范教育有了明确的目的，在高等师范独立设置的基础上，初步进行了部分的系科调整，使其有利于发挥教学效力和提高教学质量。很多高等师范学校，都曾致力于学习苏联先进教育经验，进行了不同程度的教学改革，开始积累了一些经验。师范学院和师范专科学校试行中央教育部所颁发的教学计划草案，开始改变了旧时高等师范学校教学无目的、无计划的情况，使高等师范学校的教学工作，有了一个明确的方向。所有这些成就为高等师范教育打下了初步的基础，也为今后的改革和发展，提供了有利的条件。但高等师范的规模还远不能适应中等学校师资的需要，高等师范学校的师资条件也不能适应当前和今后的需要，师范教育中教学改革的进行还只是一个开端；这次会议的任务就是要努力来解决一些迫切需要解决而又可能解决的问题，为今后高等师范教育制订出一个工作纲领。接着张部长提出了高等师范教育五年中的方针、任务和发展规模，高等师范学校领导关系，学制，培养与提高师资，以及教学改革等问题和初步意见，提交大会讨论研究。（新华社）
