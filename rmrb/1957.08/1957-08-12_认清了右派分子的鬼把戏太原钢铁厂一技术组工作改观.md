    Recognizing the Rightist Tricks: Work Improvement in a Technical Group at Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant

    (Our report) In the technical group of the steelmaking department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, many technicians used to be slow and procrastinating in their work. It was only during the struggle against the Rightists that it became clear that this was caused by Chen Sifo, a Rightist technician. Chen Sifo came from a large bureaucratic landlord family. After arriving at the plant, he frequently engaged in activities of sowing discord among the technicians. He would tell technicians who graduated from secondary technical schools: "Go to college, going to college will bring you a bright future." He would tell college graduates: "Staying in the factory has no future. The future lies in entering scientific research institutes or becoming graduate students." During the rectification campaign, he vigorously spread anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks published in the Wenhui Bao.

    Through the struggle, the comrades in the technical group saw through the purpose of Rightists like Chen Sifo in maliciously spreading rumors, and their awareness was raised. Now they complete their tasks quickly and well. (Huang Deshu, Gu Ye)

    认清了右派分子的鬼把戏太原钢铁厂一技术组工作改观
    本报讯　太原钢铁厂炼钢部的技术组，从前有不少技术员工作是拖拉疲沓，在反击右派分子的斗争中才弄清楚，这是右派分子技术员陈思佛一手造成的。陈思佛出身于一个大官僚地主家庭，来厂后经常在技术员们当中进行挑拨离间的活动。对中等技术学校毕业的技术员说：“考大学去吧，大学出来就有前途了。”对大学毕业的技术员又说：“在工厂待下去没有前途，前途就是进科学研究院或作研究生。”整风期间，他大肆散布文汇报刊载的反党反社会主义的言论。
    通过斗争，技术组的同志们看穿了右派分子陈思佛等人恶意造谣的目的，觉悟提高了。现在他们完成任务又快又好。　（黄德淑　顾页）
