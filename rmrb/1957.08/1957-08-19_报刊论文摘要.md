    The Three Great Evils are Products of Private Ownership

    The true root cause of the "Three Great Evils" (subjectivism, sectarianism, and bureaucracy) is the private ownership of the means of production and the political system that adapts to it. Exploiter groups form different factions, with cliques everywhere, vying for power and profit, and engaging in mutual recrimination. Many wars in Chinese feudal society were wars fought by exploiters or rulers for power and profit. The factional struggles within the Kuomintang and the so-called "a new dynasty, a new set of officials" in Chinese history all illustrate that sectarianism is an inevitable product of private ownership and the class nature of the exploiting classes. The exploitative position of the exploiters determines their subjective way of thinking. Their definition is "what is beneficial to me is the truth." Observing things from the perspective of whether it is beneficial to me must be subjective and one-sided. Therefore, subjectivism is a product of private ownership and is necessary for exploiters. The state apparatus of the exploiters is a tool to oppress the people, sacrificing the people to create and maintain the special interests of the exploiters. Such state administrative organs inevitably adopt oppression, deception, and even arbitrary killing against the masses of the people. Therefore, the exploiters themselves are bureaucratic overlords, and the state organs themselves are bureaucratic institutions. The rightists say that the "leadership of the Communist Party" and "people's democratic dictatorship" are the roots of the "Three Great Evils," which is obviously absurd. (Excerpted from Yu Dejun's article in the Dalian Daily on August 7th: "Are 'Party Leadership' and 'People's Democratic Dictatorship' the Roots of the 'Three Great Evils'?")

    Why is Democracy a Means?

    Means and ends only reflect the objectively existing relationships between things, and there is no question of value. We promote democracy in order to maximize the awareness and enthusiasm of the masses, and to maximize the concentration of the wisdom and opinions of the masses, so as to carry out our country's socialist economic construction and cultural construction more powerfully and correctly, develop the economy and culture, and improve the material life of the people. The consolidation of the economic base and the improvement of people's lives are our ultimate goals.

    The relationship between means and ends mentioned here reflects the relationship between politics and economy, superstructure and economic base. Various political institutions and systems, countries, parties, armies, and laws are all means. Democracy belongs to the category of politics. Now there is class struggle, and democracy belongs to both the category of democracy and dictatorship, and to the category of democracy and centralism. The current issue of democracy is of course a political issue. After the elimination of classes in the future, the meaning of politics will change, and there will still be the issue of democracy and centralism within the people. Democracy still belongs to the category of politics, and it will always serve the economy.

    Since democracy is only a means, it has no absolute meaning in itself. Whether democracy is used correctly or not has an objective standard, depending on whether it meets the requirements put forward by the purpose it serves. Whether our socialist democracy is used correctly or not depends on whether its role and effect are conducive to the consolidation of the socialist economic base. (Excerpted from Cha Ruqiang's article in the Beijing Daily on August 16th: "Why is Democracy a Means?")

    American Legal System Has Always Been Hypocritical

    Even in the period of the rise of capitalism, the American legal system was hypocritical, narrow, and incomplete. For example, the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, approved in 1791, states: "No person shall...be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law." But this provision does not apply to black people. At that time, slave owners had the power of life and death over black slaves, and killing black people was not considered a crime. Even after the abolition of slavery was stipulated in the 1865 amendment to the U.S. Constitution, corporal punishment could still be inflicted on black people. Even more inhumane is that although the U.S. Constitution has the above provisions, and federal and state criminal laws also stipulate that murder should be punished, to this day, white mobs, in collusion, lynch black people who are "unsatisfactory," which is not considered a crime and carries no legal responsibility. (Excerpted from Qiu Riqing's article in the Guangming Daily on August 14th: "Refuting Wang Zhaoshi's Fallacy that 'American Democracy is Hypocritical, but the Rule of Law is Serious'")

    报刊论文摘要
    三大主义是私有制的产物
    “三大主义”产生的真正根源是生产资料私有制及与其相适应的政治制度。剥削者集团之间各自形成不同的集团，派系林立，争权夺利，互相倾轧，中国封建社会的不少战争就是剥削者或统治者争权夺利的战争，国民党内部的派系斗争以及中国历史上的所谓“一朝天子一朝臣”都正是说明了宗派主义是私有制的必然产物，宗派主义是剥削阶级的阶级本性。剥削者的剥削地位又决定了他们的主观主义的思想方法，他们的定义是“对我有利就是真理”，一切从是否有利于我出发去观察事物，必然是主观的片面的，因此主观主义正是私有制的产物而且是剥削者所必需的。剥削者的国家机器是为了压迫人民、以牺牲人民来造成和维持剥削者的特殊权益的工具，这样的国家管理机关对人民群众必然是采取压迫、欺骗，甚至任意杀戮，因此剥削者本身就是官老爷，国家机构本身就是官僚机构。右派分子说什么“共产党的领导”、“人民民主专政”等是产生“三大主义”的根源，显然是荒谬绝伦的。（摘自8月7日旅大日报于德钧：“‘党的领导’和‘人民民主专政’是产生‘三大主义’的根源吗？”）
    民主为什么是手段
    手段和目的只是反映事物之间客观存在着的关系，无所谓价值高低的问题。我们发扬民主，是为了最大限度地提高群众的觉悟和积极性，最大限度地集中群众的智慧、意见，以便更有力地更正确地进行我国的社会主义经济建设和文化建设，发展经济和文化，改善人民的物质生活。经济基础的巩固、人民生活的改善，这是我们的最终的目的。
    这里说的手段和目的的关系是反映的政治和经济、上层建筑和经济基础之间的相互关系。各种政治机构和制度，国家、党派、军队、法律都是手段。民主属于政治的范畴。现在存在着阶级斗争，民主既属于民主和专政的范畴，又属于民主和集中的范畴，现在的民主问题当然是政治问题。将来阶级消灭后，政治的意义变化了，那时在人民内部仍然有民主和集中的问题。民主还是属于政治的范畴，它总是要为经济服务的。
    既然民主只是一种手段，它本身就没有绝对的意义，民主运用得正确与否，就有着一个客观的标准，看它是否符合于它服务的目的所提出的要求。我们的社会主义民主运用得正确与否，就要看它的作用和效果是否有利于社会主义经济基础的巩固。（摘自8月16日北京日报查汝强：“民主为什么是手段”）
    美国法制从来是虚伪的
    纵使在资本主义上升时期，美国的法制也是虚伪的、狭窄的、残缺不全的。例如1791年批准的美国宪法修正案第五条说：“人民……非依照法律的正当手续不得剥夺其生命、自由或财产。”但这个规定对于黑人就不适用。当时的奴隶主对于黑人奴隶操了生杀予夺之权，将黑人处死并不算犯罪。就在1865年美国宪法修正案规定了废止奴隶制度后，对于黑人还可施行体刑。更惨无人道的是美国宪法虽有上述规定，联邦刑法和各州刑法也规定杀人要抵罪，可是美国直至今天，对于“不满意”的黑人，白人暴徒伙同将其私刑处死，不算犯罪，在法律上毫无责任可言。（摘自8月14日光明日报丘日庆：“驳斥王造时的‘美国民主是虚伪的，但法治是认真的’谬论”）
