　　Strengthening Labor Education and Increasing Production Knowledge
　　—Current Concerns in Soviet Education—

    Soviet education circles are currently paying close attention to the issue of strengthening labor education for primary and secondary school students and cultivating their ability to engage in practical work. This is because the Soviet Union will implement ten-year universal education in its Sixth Five-Year Plan, and most high school graduates will immediately participate in practical work after graduation. In higher education, the current focus is on making learning closely integrated with practice to improve teaching quality. At present, the Soviet Union is gradually ensuring that the majority of new students admitted to universities have at least two years of practical work experience in order to improve their learning level. The enrollment regulations approved by the Soviet Ministry of Higher Education this year stipulate that in the future, 60% of the new students admitted should be young men and women with more than two years of work experience.

      Regarding Labor Education

    This year, there are approximately 1.3 million high school graduates in the Soviet Union, and all Soviet universities will enroll more than 420,000 new students. In addition to a portion of high school graduates applying to vocational and technical schools, the majority of graduates will take up labor positions. Therefore, strengthening labor education for secondary school students and providing them with certain production knowledge has become a central concern and urgent task for Soviet education circles. These issues have recently been the subject of heated discussions in the Soviet press. Kairov, President of the Academy of Educational Sciences of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic (RSFSR), stated in an article published in "Literary Gazette" when discussing current tasks: "Since the 1930s, our secondary schools have mainly developed as preparatory schools for universities. Starting around 1935-1937, general school education became somewhat one-sided. Particular attention was paid to humanities courses, which affected students' labor and technical education and their physical and aesthetic development. This was not very noticeable when universities were able to accommodate all ten-year high school graduates. However, the need to cultivate secondary school students to engage in practical work was already pointed out at the Eighteenth Party Congress. The Nineteenth and Twentieth Party Congresses put forward the task of implementing comprehensive technical education in secondary schools, which requires important revisions to teaching plans and syllabuses."

    The Soviet "Literary Gazette" also organized a broad discussion entitled "What Kind of School Do We Need?" Educational workers in Ukraine answered this question with examples. They said that two years ago, Ukraine began piloting production education in several schools, which was welcomed by the masses. The number of students applying to these schools greatly exceeded the number that could be accommodated. Now, half of the secondary schools in Ukraine have added production courses from the eighth to tenth grades. In this way, if students take up work positions after graduation, they will love labor because they have labor skills and habits, and they will also be able to handle some specific tasks.

    Educational experts from the RSFSR also answered this question with examples. Currently, new teaching plans are being piloted in 500 schools in this republic. The plan is: labor teaching courses are added from the first to fourth grades, practical courses in school factories and gardens are added from the fifth to seventh grades, and practical courses in machine manufacturing, electrical engineering, and agriculture are added from the eighth to tenth grades.

    The discussion also touched on how to correctly combine production education and general education. Some pointed out that the implementation of production education in some places has affected general education, or that both production education and general education are carried out well, but students are overburdened. Some suggested that secondary schools should be divided into humanities, technical, and biology groups from the eighth grade to facilitate students' participation in practical work after graduation. Others believe that labor education should not only start from the eighth grade, but should start from the first grade, and that production education should be adapted to local conditions and combined with local industrial and agricultural production.

    In the discussions surrounding labor education in the Soviet press, everyone put forward various opinions and suggestions, but the conclusion was one: "The school we need is a school that cultivates students to engage in labor."

    The Relationship between General Education and Professional Education

    The relationship between general education and professional education has been the subject of debate in Soviet education circles more than once. When the Soviet press launched a discussion on labor education, this issue was brought back to the agenda.

    Some suggested widely establishing secondary technical schools, so that middle school students do not have to study for ten years, but can directly enter technical schools after completing seven years. Six people, including Academician Ananiev of the Academy of Educational Sciences of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic (RSFSR), published an article in the "Literary Gazette" saying that, for example, if there are two middle school students, A and B, in the same class, A enters a secondary technical school after completing seven years, and B continues to complete ten years of secondary school. Two years later, A graduates from a technical school and enters a factory to work, while B will not graduate for another year, and when he graduates and goes to the factory, he will be much worse than A at work due to a lack of professional knowledge.

    However, many people disagreed with this opinion, believing that this would reduce the level of general education, and that establishing a huge secondary vocational education network would require a lot of funds and professional cadres. Kairov, President of the Academy of Educational Sciences of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic (RSFSR), also opposed this view. He said that this is a fundamentally unacceptable method. Secondary vocational education should be expanded on the basis of ten-year schools. The professional education currently existing on the basis of seven-year system should only be regarded as a short-term measure. He believes that general education schools cannot undertake the task of training skilled workers and experts. The current task is to improve general education, improve scientific level, closely link with life, and develop aspects that are not valued enough in current education, such as labor education, physical and aesthetic education, and foreign language learning. He believes that the foundation of Soviet national education in the future should be a twelve-year school that combines general education and comprehensive technical education.

    The Issue of Combining Higher Education with Production

    With the reform of the Soviet industrial and construction management system, it has also triggered discussions on further improving higher industrial schools, that is, how to make teaching more closely integrated with production. Many people have expressed their opinions in newspapers and magazines, advocating that higher industrial specialized schools should be moved to areas with corresponding production departments. For example, petroleum colleges can be moved to areas rich in petroleum production, etc.

    In addition, some people have also proposed that vigorously expanding the network of correspondence universities and night universities is also an important measure for closely integrating higher industrial schools with production. The Soviet "Komsomolskaya Pravda" once published articles by Gusev and Naboka, auditors of the Soviet State Supervision Department, who emphasized that education without separation from production should be the main method for the development of higher education. They said that in 1956, night schools and correspondence schools under the Soviet Ministry of Higher Education trained more than 70,000 experts, accounting for one-third of all experts trained in the Soviet Union last year, and the other two-thirds graduated from regular universities and specialized schools. They believe that this proportion should be reversed, that is, the number of students graduating from night universities and higher correspondence schools should be dominant in the future. Because with the implementation of ten-year universal education in the future, more and more middle school graduates will be put into the production front. These middle school graduates are eager to improve their professional level in their work positions. On the other hand, there are also hundreds of thousands of cadres in their original production positions who urgently need to obtain higher education. In addition, it costs 50,000 rubles to train a student in a regular university, and it costs much less to train a student in a night university or correspondence university.

### 加强劳动教育　增加生产知识　—苏联教育界当前关心的问题—

　　加强劳动教育　增加生产知识
　　—苏联教育界当前关心的问题—
    苏联教育界对于加强中小学学生的劳动教育、培养学生从事实际工作能力的问题，目前非常注意。因为苏联在第六个五年计划中要实行十年制普及教育，今后中学毕业生大多数在毕业后都要立即参加实际工作。在高等教育方面，当前注意的中心问题，是尽力使学习与实际密切结合，以提高教学质量。目前，苏联正在逐步使高等学校招收的多数新生，至少具备两年以上的实际工作经验，来提高学生的学习水平。今年苏联高等教育部批准的招生章程规定，今后招收的新生中，60％应是有两年以上工龄的男女青年。
      关于劳动教育问题
    今年苏联中学毕业生约有一百三十万，全苏高等学校将招收四十二万多名新生，除了还有一部分中学毕业生投考专业技术学校以外，大部分毕业生都将走上劳动岗位。因此，加强中学生的劳动教育，给他们一定的生产知识的问题，就成为苏联教育界注意的中心和迫切的任务了。这些问题最近在苏联报刊上曾展开了热烈的讨论。俄罗斯联邦共和国教育科学院院长凯罗夫在“文学报”发表的文章中，谈到当前的任务时说道：“从三十年代开始我们的中等学校主要是作为高等学校的预备学校而发展的。大约从1935年—1937年开始，普通学校的教育有些片面。对人文学课程特别注意，影响了对学生的劳动技术教育和他们在体力、美学方面的发展。当高等学校能够容纳全部十年制中学毕业生的时候，这还不大觉察得出。但是在第十八次党代表大会上就已经指出了培养中学生从事实际工作的必要性。第十九次和第二十次党代表大会提出了在中学实行综合技术教育的任务，这就要求对教学计划和教学大纲作重要的修改”。
    苏联“文学报”还以“我们需要什么样的学校？”为题组织了广泛的讨论。乌克兰的教育工作者用实例回答了这个问题。他们说，两年前乌克兰开始在几个学校里试行生产教育，结果受到了广大群众的欢迎。报考这几个学校的学生大大超过了能够容纳的数量。现在，乌克兰已经有半数的中学从八年级到十年级增添了生产课程。这样，学生毕业后如果走上工作岗位，他们因为有了劳动的本领和习惯，就会爱好劳动，而且也能胜任一些具体工作。
    俄罗斯联邦共和国的教育专家也以实例回答了这个问题。目前在这个共和国的五百个学校试行新的教学计划。这个计划是：从一年级到四年级增加了劳动教学课，从五年级到七年级增加了在学校的工厂和园地中的实习课，从八年级到十年级增加机器制造、电工和农业等方面的实践课程。
    讨论中也涉及到生产教育和普通教育怎样正确结合的问题，有人指出，个别地方由于实行生产教育而影响了普通教育，或是生产教育和普通教育都进行得很好，但出现了学生负担过重的现象。有人建议中学从八年级起分成人文、技术、生物学三组，以便于学生毕业后参加实际工作，也有人认为，劳动教育不只是应从八年级开始，要从一年级就开始，而且生产教育要因地制宜，要与当地的工农业生产相结合。
    在苏联报刊上围绕着劳动教育问题的讨论中，大家提出了各种意见和建议，但结论是一个：“我们需要的学校是培养学生从事劳动的学校”。
    普通教育和专业教育的关系
    普通教育和专业教育的关系问题，不只一次成为苏联教育界争论的对象。苏联报刊上展开关于劳动教育的讨论时，这个问题又被提上了日程。
    有人建议广泛设立中等技术学校，中学生不必读十年，读完七年后就可直接入技术学校。俄罗斯联邦共和国教育科学院院士阿那尼耶夫等六个人曾在“文学报”上发表文章说，例如有甲乙两个同班中学生，甲读完七年后进中等技术学校，乙继续读完十年制中学。两年以后，甲在技术学校毕业进工厂工作，而乙还要经过一年才能毕业，而且毕业后到工厂，由于缺乏专业知识在工作上就要比甲差得远。
    但是很多人不同意这个意见，认为这样作就会降低普通教育的水平，而且建立起庞大的中等专业教育网需要大量的资金和专业干部。俄罗斯联邦共和国教育科学院院长凯罗夫也反对这种意见。他说，这是个根本不能采取的办法。应当在十年制学校基础上再来扩大中等专业教育。目前存在的七年制基础上的专业教育，只应看作是短时期必须采取的措施。他认为，普通教育学校不能承担培养熟练工人和专家的任务，现在的任务在于改进普通教育，提高科学水平，密切同生活的联系，发展目前教育中重视不够的方面，例如劳动教育、体力和美学教育、外国语的学习等。他认为，苏联国民教育的基础将来应该是十二年制的、普通教育和综合技术教育相结合的学校。
    高等学校与生产结合的问题
    随着苏联工业和建设管理制度的改革，也引起了对进一步改善高等工业学校问题的讨论，即怎样使教学同生产更加密切结合。不少人在报刊上发表意见，主张高等工业专科学校应迁到有相应生产部门的地区去。例如，石油学院可迁至盛产石油的地区去等等。
    此外，也有人提出，大力扩大函授大学和夜大学网，也是高等工业学校与生产密切结合的重要措施之一。苏联“共青真理报”曾发表了苏联国家监察部稽核长古谢夫和纳包卡的文章，他们强调不脱离生产的教育，应当是高等教育发展的主要方法。他们说，1956年苏联高教部所属的夜校和函授学校培养出七万多名专家，占去年全苏培养出的全部专家的三分之一，其他三分之二是在正规大学和专科学校毕业的。他们认为，这个比例应该倒过来，即将来从夜大学和高等函授学校毕业的学生数量要占优势。因为今后随着十年制普及教育的实行，投入生产战线的中学毕业生越来越多了。这些中学毕业生渴望在工作岗位上提高专业水平。另一方面在原有生产岗位上还有数十万干部也迫切须要获得高等教育。此外，在正规大学里培养一个学生需五万卢布，在夜大学或函授大学里培养学生就要省得多。
