To better welcome and complete the construction tasks of factory and mine employee housing in the Second Five-Year Plan, the State Construction Commission has entrusted the Architectural Society of China to hold a factory and mine employee housing design competition nationwide, starting from August 1st.

The Architectural Society of China has issued the competition rules and outline for the factory and mine employee housing design, requiring that the projects participating in the design competition earnestly implement the principles of practicality, economy, and aesthetic appeal where possible. In terms of economy, it is required to lower standards and reduce costs, so that the standards of employee housing built in the future are not too different from the housing standards of local residents. The outline points out that as long as designers pay attention to experiencing the lives of the broad masses of local workers, earnestly absorb the excellent traditions of local architecture, and consider adapting to local conditions and using local materials in their designs, they can build housing that suits workers' living habits at extremely low prices.

The outline stipulates that the design competition projects are single-story houses and two-story and three-story houses.

In order to encourage creation and improve design standards, the State Construction Commission will award bonuses or certificates to the excellent designs participating in this competition. First prize will receive a bonus of 5,000 yuan and a certificate; second prize will receive a bonus of 3,000 yuan and a certificate; third prize will receive a bonus of 1,000 yuan and a certificate; fourth prize will receive a certificate. There is no limit to the number of winners, and the evaluation will be based entirely on the design level.
