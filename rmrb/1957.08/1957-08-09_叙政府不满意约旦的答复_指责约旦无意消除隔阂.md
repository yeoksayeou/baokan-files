Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, August 8th: Syrian Minister of State for Information and Propaganda, Salah Akil, told Xinhua reporters on August 7th that Syria is not satisfied with Jordan's reply to Syria's statement of August 3rd, "because it is not out of sincerity and a genuine desire to eliminate the discord between Syria and Jordan."

The Syrian government issued a statement on August 3rd rejecting the threats issued to Syria by Jordanian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Rifai. Rifai had said that if Syrian newspapers did not stop criticizing the Jordanian government, Jordan would not hesitate to take military action. A spokesman for the Syrian Foreign Ministry revealed the full text of Jordan's response to Syria's August 3rd statement on the 6th. This reply contained nothing other than an apology to Syria.

Akil said that the purpose of Jordan's reply was merely to shirk the responsibility of the Jordanian Foreign Minister, and that there were many malicious intentions in doing so.

Akil analyzed the reasons why Jordan apologized to Syria. He said that Rifai originally wanted to hinder understanding between Syria and Jordan in order to link his country with imperialism. But when Rifai discovered the firm position of the Arab countries, he felt that his plan had failed. He put himself in a predicament that no politician would.

    叙政府不满意约旦的答复
    指责约旦无意消除隔阂
    据新华社大马士革8日电　叙利亚负责新闻和宣传的国务部长萨拉赫·阿基勒8月7日对新华社记者说，叙利亚不满意约旦对叙利亚8月3日声明的答复，“因为它不是出于诚意和真正想要消除叙利亚和约旦之间的隔阂的愿望”。
    叙利亚政府曾经在8月3日发表声明，拒绝了约旦副首相兼外交大臣里法伊向叙利亚发出的威胁。里法伊曾经说，如果叙利亚报纸对约旦政府的抨击不停止，约旦将不惜采取武力行动。叙利亚外交部发言人6日透露了约旦对叙利亚8月3日声明的答复全文。这个答复除了向叙利亚表示道歉以外，没有其他内容。
    阿基勒说，约旦这个答复的目的仅仅在于推卸约旦外交大臣的责任，这样做是有许多不良意图的。
    阿基勒分析了约旦所以向叙利亚道歉的原因。他说，原先里法伊想阻碍叙利亚和约旦之间的谅解以便使他的国家和帝国主义连结起来。可是当里法伊发现阿拉伯国家的坚定立场后，他觉得他的计划失败了。他使自己陷入了任何政治家都不会陷入的困境。
