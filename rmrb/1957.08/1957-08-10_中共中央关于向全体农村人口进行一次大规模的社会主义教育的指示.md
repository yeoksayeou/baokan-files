The following directive was issued by the CCP Central Committee on August 8, 1957:

    Currently, it is necessary to conduct a large-scale socialist education campaign in rural areas. The central topics of the education are: first, the superiority of cooperatives; second, the unified purchase and sale of grain and other agricultural products; third, the relationship between workers and peasants; fourth, suppression of counter-revolutionaries and adherence to the legal system, and so on. The method of education is: using production breaks and rest time, hold large-scale debates on these central topics among the entire rural population, raise questions, offer opinions, present facts, reason things out, and recall and compare the changes in farmers' lives before and after liberation and before and after cooperation. For the convenience and popularization of the debates, each cooperative can also propose some specific comparative questions based on its own situation. Before the autumn harvest, the debate should focus on the unified purchase and sale issue, appropriately combined with the urgent problems that need to be solved at that time and place. The debate on these issues is essentially a debate about the two roads of socialism and capitalism. This kind of debate has already begun in many villages. The result of the debate is: it has helped the broad masses of peasants and township and community cadres to further clarify the major issues of right and wrong in the country and in rural areas, explained the correctness of the current fundamental policies implemented by the state, and explained that the capitalist road can only make a very small number of people rich, while making the majority poor and bankrupt, and that socialism is the only way for working peasants to develop together and become prosperous together. Some well-to-do middle peasants are nostalgic for the capitalist road and dissatisfied with certain fundamental policies implemented by the state, but in the debate, they also realized that even among them, those who could侥幸 become rich through speculation and profiteering in the old society were only one or two percent, and most of them would still be unable to become rich. Many people used to doubt the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, but the conclusion of the mass debate was: this policy is very good, without it, many people would starve or even lose their families under the manipulation of grain merchants. Those landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries who continue to engage in sabotage activities are further exposed and attacked by the masses in the debate. The masses also advocate giving necessary constraints to those who are idle and do not engage in labor. In short, this debate has greatly raised the socialist consciousness of the peasant masses and township and community cadres, corrected right-leaning opportunist thinking within the Party, promoted righteousness, and overwhelmed evil. In order to consolidate the cooperative system, strengthen the unity of poor and middle peasants, raise the greater production enthusiasm of the peasant masses, improve the work of cooperatives, consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, complete the state's grain purchase tasks, and ensure the smooth progress of the entire national economic plan, in addition to criticizing the reactionary words and deeds of the bourgeois rightists in the cities, it is absolutely necessary to launch such a large-scale debate in the countryside.
    The Central Committee believes that in places where this kind of debate has not yet been launched, Party committees at all levels must, in a prepared and orderly manner, send work teams from top to bottom to assist the Party organizations of townships and communities in presiding over this debate, so as to forcefully criticize the capitalist thinking of well-to-do middle peasants and oppose all individualism and departmentalism that disregard national and collective interests, unify the concepts of loving the country, loving the community, and loving the family among the masses, and universally cultivate the habit of running communities and managing households diligently and thriftily. The debate must involve the entire rural population (including individual households), and the organization can be large or small. Generally, within the scope of small groups or teams, the debate can be more thorough and in-depth. However, when necessary, a debate meeting of all community members or all village peasants can also be held. During the debate, everyone should be allowed to speak freely, so that the masses can distinguish between what is correct and what is wrong in the debate and in the exchange of opinions. In addition to immediately and forcefully countering the reactionary and inflammatory remarks of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and other bad elements, a very good attitude must be adopted to explain and persuade the masses' misunderstandings or wrong opinions, and the same attitude should be taken towards the wrong remarks of well-to-do middle peasants.
    These major debates on the fundamental issues of the two roads in rural areas are the socialist self-education of the peasant masses and township and community cadres, and are the rectification campaign in rural areas. Party committees at all levels in provinces, cities, autonomous regions, prefectures, and counties must have a good grasp of the leadership of this major debate in rural areas. The criticisms made by the masses in the debate regarding the work style of township and community cadres must be carefully studied and appropriately handled by Party committees at all levels in order to improve work and unite the masses.
    Regarding the adjustment of internal and external relations of agricultural producers' cooperatives, the improvement of operation and management, and other issues, the Central Committee is preparing to issue further instructions after studying the experiences of rectifying communities in various places.

    中共中央关于向全体农村人口进行一次大规模的社会主义教育的指示
    （一九五七年八月八日）
    在目前农村中，有必要进行一次大规模的社会主义教育。教育的中心题目是：第一，合作社优越性问题；第二，粮食和其他农产品统购统销问题；第三，工农关系问题；第四，肃反和遵守法制问题，等等。教育的方式是：利用生产间隙和休息时间，在全体农村人口中就这些中心题目举行大辩论，提问题，提意见，摆事实，讲道理，回忆、对比解放前后和合作化前后农民生活的变化。为着辩论的方便和通俗化起见，各合作社还都可以根据自己的情况，分别提出一些具体的对比问题。秋收以前的辩论，要着重统购统销问题，适当地结合当时当地迫切需要解决的问题。对于这些问题的辩论，实质上是关于社会主义和资本主义两条道路的辩论。这种辩论在不少乡村已经开始进行。辩论的结果是：帮助了广大农民群众和乡社干部进一步地弄清国家和农村中的大是大非，说明了当前国家所实行的各项根本政策的正确性，说明了资本主义道路只能使极少数人发财，使大多数人贫困和破产，而社会主义才是劳动农民共同发展和共同富裕的唯一出路。部分富裕中农留恋资本主义道路，不满意国家所实行的某些根本政策，但在辩论中，也觉悟到他们中间如果在旧社会里面靠投机倒把、能够侥幸发财的人也不过百分之一、二，而大多数还是不可能成为富人。曾经有不少人怀疑粮食的统购统销政策，但群众辩论的结论却是：这个政策好得很，不这样，就得有很多人在粮食商的操纵下挨饿以至家破人亡。那些继续从事破坏活动的地主富农和反革命分子，在辩论中，进一步地被揭穿，受到群众的打击。对于那些游手好闲、不务劳动的人，群众也主张给以必要的约束。总之，这种辩论大大地提高了农民群众和乡社干部的社会主义觉悟，纠正了党内的右倾机会主义思想，发扬了正气，压倒了邪气。我们要巩固合作社制度，加强贫农中农的团结，提高农民群众的更大的生产积极性，改进合作社的工作，巩固工农的联盟，完成国家购粮的任务，保证整个国家经济计划的顺利进行，除了必须在城市批判资产阶级右派的反动言行以外，在农村中展开这样一场大辩论是完全必要的。
    中央认为：凡是还没有展开这种辩论的地方，各级党委都必须有准备地、有次序地、自上而下地派遣工作组协助乡社的党组织主持这种辩论，以便有力地批判富裕中农的资本主义思想，反对一切不顾国家利益和集体利益的个人主义和本位主义，使爱国、爱社和爱家的观念在群众中统一起来，并普遍地养成勤俭办社和勤俭持家的风气。辩论会必须吸收全体农村居民（包括单干户）参加，组织可小可大。一般地在小组或小队的范围内，可以辩论得较为充分和较为深入。但在必要时，也可以举行全体社员或全村农民的辩论大会。辩论时，要让各人畅所欲言，让群众在辩论中，在交换意见中，辨别出那些是正确的和那些是错误的。除了对地主、富农、反革命分子和其他坏分子的反动的煽动言论必须即时地有力地给以反击之外，对于群众的误解或错误意见，都必须采取很好的态度加以解释和说服，对于富裕中农的错误言论的态度，也应该这样。
    这些关系农村两条道路的根本问题的大辩论，是农民群众和乡社干部的社会主义自我教育，是农村的整风。各省、市、自治区党委和地委、县委对于农村中的这场大辩论，必须很好地掌握领导。群众在大辩论中，对于乡社干部作风所提出的批评，各级党委必须认真研究，适当处理，以便改进工作，团结群众。
    关于农业生产合作社内外关系的调整、经营管理的改善等问题，中央准备在研究各地整社的经验之后，再发指示。
