Lanzhou, August 6th (Reporter Liu Bang) -- The people of Gansu are currently peeling away, layer by layer, the sanctimonious facade of Shui Zi, the Vice-Chairman of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, who has styled himself as the "perfect man of the Northwest." Under the guise of helping the Communist Party with its rectification campaign, Shui Zi brandished shields such as "forgiveness," "benevolent governance," and the "characteristics of the scholar," firing several poisoned arrows at the people's government's judicial work and personnel system, and viciously sowing discord between the Party and intellectuals.

To embolden counter-revolutionaries, landlords, and riffraff, Shui Zi mocked the Party for not understanding the "do not do unto others what you do not want done unto yourself" principle of forgiveness, and openly criticized the Party and the people's government for not implementing benevolent governance. To defend the old legal system, he said, "I disagree with criticizing the Six Codes. What is wrong with the Six Codes?"

In order to thoroughly usurp the revolutionary instruments of suppression, he extravagantly claimed, "Law enforcement requires specialized talent and cannot be replaced by policies and politics." Shui Zi vehemently attacked the current personnel system, cursing those who work in personnel departments, calling themselves "Heavenly Officials of the Ministry of Personnel," and distributing jobs as "Heavenly Officials Bestowing Blessings," and cursing the personnel departments' control of files as "Registers of Life and Death." He lamented that "talent is being left undiscovered in the fields." He attempted to weaken and even eliminate the Party's leadership over personnel work, advocating that "personnel agencies should appropriately increase non-Party members to prevent personnel agencies from becoming hubs of factionalism." He demanded a change to the Party and government's policy of selecting cadres based on both virtue and talent, advocating that importance should be attached to "academic qualifications" when employing people, essentially aiming to kick worker and peasant cadres aside.

He also spoke about the relationship between "scholars" and the Communist Party with ulterior motives. First, he distorted the meaning of "scholar" into a superior person above the masses. Then, he forcefully equated the scholar-officials of feudal society with today's democratic figures. Furthermore, he cited extensively to tout that "scholars" "do not take shortcuts" and "form groups but are not partisan," mocking the Party for not understanding these characteristics of "scholars," hurting the "scholars'" feelings, and thus creating a distance between "scholars" and the Communist Party. He insinuated that those intellectuals who currently participate in and approach the Communist Party are taking shortcuts and engaging in political speculation, which goes against the way of the "scholar." He flaunted that he was unwilling to go to the United Front Work Department, believing that those who go to the United Front Work Department have no "backbone."

In short, Shui Zi was trying to portray himself as a compassionate savior and a "guardian of the Way" with boundless integrity. In reality, discerning people only need to pay attention to whom Shui Zi pities and what Way he defends, and Shui Zi's rightist face will be completely exposed. In recent days, the broad masses who understand Shui Zi's "background" have been exposing his ugly history one after another.

Shui Zi once offered a strategy to Zhu Shaoliang, a henchman of Chiang Kai-shek who ruled Gansu: "Now the communist bandits are rampant, and people are uneasy. The commander-in-chief is stationed in the Northwest and must kill to establish authority; harsh laws should be used in chaotic times, and kill more to see if they are afraid!"

This "scholar" who prided himself on "a gentleman does not form factions" had already joined the Kuomintang, the Northern Warlords, the Northwest Army, the Northeast Army, and Chiang Kai-shek one after another since 1912. For Chiang Kai-shek, whom the people of the whole country couldn't wait to "perish together with," Shui Zi wished him "to shine as the sun and moon, and to live as long as heaven and earth."...

It seems that Shui Zi is indeed a standard opportunist who is shameless and changes his allegiance with the wind, but he refuses to side with the people.

    解放前对共产党主张用重典，解放后对反革命要求施仁政
    水梓是个十足的伪君子
    甘肃群众看穿了这个民革副主任委员的真面目
    本报兰州6日电　记者柳梆报道：甘肃人民这几天正在层层剥开自诩为“西北完人”的民革甘肃省委副主任委员水梓的道貌岸然的外衣。水梓借帮助共产党整风之机，抬出了“恕道”、“仁政”和“士的特性”等盾牌，对人民政府的司法工作、人事制度射出了几支毒箭，并且狠毒地挑拨党和知识分子的关系。为了替反革命分子和地主流氓之流打气撑腰，水梓讥讽党不懂“己所不欲勿施于人”的恕道，公开责备党和人民政府不施仁政。为了维护旧法统，他说“我不同意批判六法观点。六法观点有什么不好？”为了达到彻底篡夺革命刀把子的目的，他侈言“执法要有专门人材，不能拿政策和政治来代替”。水梓大肆攻击现行的人事制度，谩骂做人事工作的人自命是“吏部天官”，给人分配工作是“天官赐福”，诅咒人事部门掌握档案材料是“生死簿”。他惋惜现在“野有遗才”。他企图削弱以至于取消党对人事工作的领导，主张“人事机构应酌量增加非党人士，免使人事机构成为宗派主义的枢纽”。他要求改变党和政府德才兼顾的干部政策，主张用人要重视“学历”，实质上是要把工农干部一脚踢开。他还居心叵测地大谈其“士”与共产党的关系。他首先把“士”曲解为超然于群众之上的人上人，继而把封建社会的士大夫强拉硬扯为就是今天的民主人士，再则旁证博引地吹嘘“士”“行不由径”、“党而不群”；嘲笑党不懂得“士”的这些特性，伤了“士”的心，因此造成“士”和共产党之间的距离。他影射现在那些参加和接近共产党的知识分子是走小路，是政治投机，有悖于为“士”之道。他标榜他自己不愿意上统战部的门，认为到统战部去的人都没有“骨气”。一句话，水梓在这里竭力把自己装扮成一个悲天悯人的救世主，一个气节磅礴的“卫道之士”。其实，明眼人只要留心一下水梓悯的是什么人，卫的是什么道，水梓的右派面目就完全暴露了。连日以来，了解水梓的“底”的广大群众，纷纷揭穿他的丑恶历史。水梓，当年曾经向统治过甘肃的蒋帮爪牙朱绍良献策：“现在共匪猖狂，人心不安，长官坐镇西北，必须杀以立威；乱世用重典，多杀一些，看他怕不怕！”这个自矜“君子不党”的“士”，早在1912年起就先后投靠过国民党、北洋军阀、西北军、东北军和蒋介石。对于全国人民恨不得“与之偕亡”的蒋介石，水梓却祝他“与日月同光，与天地齐寿”。……看来，水梓不愧是一个标准的有奶便是娘，随风四面倒的卑鄙政客，然而他可硬是不肯倒向人民。
