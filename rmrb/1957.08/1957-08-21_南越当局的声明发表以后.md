Report from our correspondent in Hanoi, Xiao Guang:

"As long as there is a bit of skin and flesh left, I will continue to fight for the peaceful reunification of the motherland, for the territory and compatriots of beloved South Vietnam!" This is a sentence written in a notebook by Nguyen Van Luyen, a South Vietnamese soldier who went north to regroup. Having lost both hands in the war against the French colonialists, Nguyen Van Luyen not only bravely survived in order to persist in the struggle for reunification, but also overcame numerous difficulties to learn to write and produce with his arms.

Recently, Nguyen Van Luyen's story has been spreading here: his deeds are deeply moving; his oath has resonated in the hearts of the people. In fact, in Vietnam, there are more than just thousands of people like Nguyen Van Luyen. The urgent call for reunification can be heard almost anytime, anywhere. Especially recently, after the statement of the South Vietnamese authorities, people saw that the Ngo Dinh Diem group once again disregarded the Vietnamese people's desire for peaceful reunification and rejected the proposal of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to consult on general elections, and therefore the will to struggle became even more resolute.

In its statement issued on July 26, the South Vietnamese authorities first took advantage of the South Vietnamese people's lack of clear understanding of the entire process of the Geneva Conference, attempting to shift the responsibility for dividing the country to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. But in fact, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has always believed that the demarcation of the temporary military demarcation line was only a temporary and transitional measure taken to achieve an armistice, restore peace, and achieve national reunification through general elections. As early as the Geneva Conference, Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong clearly stated: "The reunification of the country must be realized according to the will of the people. The reunification of the country can only be achieved through free, democratic, and unhindered general elections." "But in order to hold such elections, it is necessary to first achieve an armistice, achieve a ceasefire, and study and demarcate the assembly areas of both sides." There is no question of "long-term division" here at all, and what's more, the final declaration of the Geneva Conference also clearly stipulated: "The military demarcation line is a temporary line, and in no way should it be interpreted as a political or territorial boundary"; and it stipulated that Vietnam would hold general elections under the supervision of the International Commission in July 1956 to achieve national reunification.

At that time, however, the South Vietnamese delegation's proposal was: either continue fighting and let the flames of war spread throughout the country; or assemble on the spot, regardless of the intertwined situation of the two sides. Obviously, this approach was only beneficial to those who attempted to expand the Indochina War and establish new military aggression blocs for this purpose. At that time, the South Vietnamese representatives avoided talking about the issue of implementing the provisions of the Geneva Accords regarding the holding of national general elections.

After the Geneva Conference, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam exemplarily fulfilled the provisions of the Geneva Accords and actively sought to create conditions for the peaceful reunification of Vietnam; while the Ngo Dinh Diem regime in South Vietnam unreasonably rejected all proposals and appeals from the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for consultations on general elections in accordance with the Geneva Accords.

The Ngo Dinh Diem regime described the current system of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam as "the greatest obstacle to the matter of unification"; that "whether or not free elections can be held to unify the territory depends entirely on the policies of the Hanoi authorities." It used this unreasonable excuse to delay the holding of general elections as scheduled by the Geneva Accords. In fact, although the systems in the North and South are different, the right to decide lies with the people. The Vietnamese people have the right to independently choose their system, and any attempt by one side to force or annex the other is wrong. The South Vietnamese authorities stated: "The 'freedom' (?) of South Vietnam cannot be 'sacrificed' for the sake of unification." This can only show how lacking in confidence it is in its own political system.

In addition to repeating the old tune of "North Vietnam has no freedom," the Ngo Dinh Diem regime did not give a positive answer to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's request for consultations on general elections, nor did it mention its proposal to restore normal relations between the North and South. Therefore, although the Ngo Dinh Diem regime also used many specious examples and piled up many pleasant words in this statement of more than 400 words, its conspiracy to find excuses to refuse general elections and attempt to permanently divide Vietnam still could not escape the eyes and ears of the people.

This statement by the South Vietnamese authorities has aroused widespread anger among the people on both sides of the 17th parallel. In the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the public has raised questions. The Vietnamese "People's Daily" wants the Ngo Dinh Diem regime to take practical actions, not cunning statements. The newspaper wrote: "Ngo Dinh Diem said that the Southern regime's 'unchanging attitude is to advocate unifying the territory through general elections,' but how can this attitude be reflected if it is not through consultations between representatives of both sides?" Professor Pham Huy Thong, representative of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, condemned the unreasonable actions of the Ngo Dinh Diem regime in refusing consultations, saying: This is a deliberate attempt to sabotage the Geneva Accords, obstruct national reunification, and deliberately plunge the people of half the country into suffering and displacement. This approach is only beneficial to the United States. In recent days, people's organizations such as the Vietnam Fatherland Front, the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, the Vietnam National Farmers Liaison Committee, the Vietnam Women's Union, and the Vietnam Literary and Art Association have all written letters to the people of South Vietnam, calling on them to fight for the peaceful reunification of the motherland. People from all walks of life in Vietnam have also recently gathered to discuss the statement issued by the spokesman of the Prime Minister's Office of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on August 1. The statement pointed out: "The fate of Vietnam can only be decided by the Vietnamese people. The era of imperialism running rampant in weak countries is over. The matter of unifying the motherland is a matter for the Vietnamese people. The difference in political systems between the two sides is not and cannot be an obstacle to this matter." In order to better carry out activities to strive for the restoration of normal relations between the North and South, "Committees for Striving to Restore Normal Relations Between the North and South" have been established in all provinces and cities.

The situation in South Vietnam under the rule of the Ngo Dinh Diem regime is no exception: in Thua Thien Province, 70,000 people signed petitions within half a month, requesting the South Vietnamese regime to consult with the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the issue of general elections; in the central Vietnamese region, more than 85% of the people held strikes and market closures for this purpose. News from many provinces such as Quang Tri, Quang Nam, and Can Tho said that the South Vietnamese people wholeheartedly support the statement of August 1 by the Prime Minister's Office of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. People said: After three years of construction competition, we know which social system to choose. Some people also compared the achievements of construction in North Vietnam with the official statistics published by South Vietnamese newspapers and magazines. They have been excerpted and published in the Vietnamese "Unification Daily" and "Independence Daily." Just a few examples are enough: in the past three years, North Vietnam has newly established eighteen industrial and mining enterprises with modern equipment, and fully restored a dozen mines and factories such as the Hong Gai Coal Mine, the Haiphong Water Tower, and the Nam Dinh Textile Factory. The eighteen factories established in the liberated areas during the war have also been expanded. However, South Vietnam has not established half a new enterprise except for the restoration of production at the Nong Son Coal Mine in Quang Nam Province. North Vietnam has repaired 575 kilometers of railway, while South Vietnam has only repaired 80 kilometers. In 1956, the harvest of late rice in North Vietnam was 4,132,000 tons, while South Vietnam was only 3,514,620 tons. In the past three years, South Vietnam, which has always been known for exporting rice, has repeatedly imported American rice; North Vietnam, however, began to eliminate the historical shortage of food for the first time last year and also exported some rice.

Facts show that the Ngo Dinh Diem regime in South Vietnam has become increasingly isolated among the South Vietnamese people due to its refusal to consult and its refusal to restore normal relations between the North and South. If it is willing to continue to act as a pawn of American imperialism and persist in the policy of dividing the country, it will eventually be abandoned by the entire people and condemned by world public opinion and fall into an unsustainable situation.

### 南越当局的声明发表以后

　　南越当局的声明发表以后
　　本报驻河内记者　萧光
    “只要还有一点皮和肉，我就要为祖国的和平统一，为亲爱的南越的疆土和同胞继续奋斗！”这是北上集结的南越战士阮文练写在日记本上的一句话。在抗击法国殖民者的战争中失去了自己双手的阮文练，为了坚持统一斗争，不仅勇敢地活了下来，而且克服重重困难，学会了用胳臂写字和生产。
    近些时候，阮文练的故事在这里被传颂着：他的事迹使人深受感动；他的誓言在群众心里已经引起了共鸣。其实在越南，像阮文练这样的人何止千万。几乎可以随时随地听到人民要求统一的迫切呼声。特别是最近，在南越当局的声明发表以后，人们看到吴庭艳集团再一次不顾越南人民和平统一的愿望，拒绝了同越南民主共和国政府协商普选的建议，因而斗争的意志更加坚决。
    南越当局在它7月26日发表的声明里，首先利用南越人民不大清楚日内瓦会议的全部过程，妄图把分裂国家的责任推给越南民主共和国。但是事实上，越南民主共和国政府一贯认为划定临时军事分界线，只是为了实现停战、恢复和平和用普选的方法实现全国统一而采取的一项暂时的、过渡性的措施。范文同外长早在日内瓦会议上已经明确表示：“全国的统一必须根据人民的意志来实现。全国的统一只能靠自由的、民主的和没有任何外国干涉的普选来实现。”“但是为了举行这种选举，必须首先实现停战，实现停火，并研究和划定双方的集结地区”，这里根本牵扯不上“长期分治”问题，何况日内瓦会议最后宣言也明文规定：“军事分界线是临时性的界线，无论如何不能被解释为政治的或领土的边界”；并规定越南将在1956年7月内在国际委员会的监督下举行普选，以实现全国的统一。
    而当时南越代表团的建议却是：或者继续打下去，任凭战火遍烧全国；或者就地集结，不管双方犬牙交错的局面。显然，这种做法只对那些企图扩大印度支那战争、并为此而建立新的军事侵略集团的人们有利。当时，南越代表对实现日内瓦协议中关于举行全国普选的问题却避而不谈。
    日内瓦会议以后，越南民主共和国政府模范地履行了日内瓦协议的条款，并且积极地设法为越南的和平统一创造条件；而南越的吴庭艳政权却对越南民主共和国政府按照日内瓦协议要求普选协商的所有建议和呼吁，一概给予无理拒绝。
    吴庭艳政权把越南民主共和国的现行制度，说成是“统一事项的最大障碍”；什么“能否自由选举以统一领土，完全要看河内当局的政策”。它用这种毫无道理的借口拖延普选工作按照日内瓦协议如期举行。实际上，尽管南、北两地区的制度不同，定夺的权利却在于人民。越南人民有权利独立自主地选择他们的制度，任何一方想强迫或并吞另一方的做法都是错误的。南越当局表示：“不能因为统一而‘牺牲’南越的‘自由’（？）”。这只能说明它对本身的政治制度是如何的缺乏信心。
    吴庭艳政权除了重弹“北越没有自由”的老调，对越南民主共和国协商普选的要求不予正面的答复，对它恢复南北正常关系的建议也一字不提。因此，尽管吴庭艳政权在这篇四百多字的声明里，也用了许多似是而非的事例，堆砌了不少好听的辞句，但是它寻找借口拒绝普选、企图长期分裂越南的阴谋，仍然逃不过人民的耳目。
    南越当局的这项声明，激起了十七度线南北人民广泛的怒潮。在越南民主共和国，公众纷纷提出质问。越南“人民报”要吴庭艳政权拿出实际行动来，而不是狡猾的声明。这家报纸写道：“吴庭艳说南方政权‘不变的态度是主张用普选的方法统一领土’，但是如果不通过双方代表的协商，怎么能体现这种态度？”越南祖国战线代表范辉通教授谴责吴庭艳政权拒绝协商的无理行动，他说：这是蓄意破坏日内瓦协议、阻挠国家统一，蓄意把半个国家的人民沦于痛苦和颠沛中。这样做法只对美国有利。连日以来，越南祖国战线、越南总工会、越南全国农民联络委员会、越南妇女联合会和越南文艺会等人民团体，都先后写信给南越人民，号召他们为争取祖国的和平统一而奋斗。越南各界人民最近也纷纷集会，讨论越南民主共和国总理府发言人8月1日发表的声明。声明指出：“越南的命运只能由越南人民决定，帝国主义在弱小国家横行霸道的时代已经过去了。统一祖国的事情是越南人民的事情。双方政治制度的不同，不是也不可能是这个事情的障碍。”为了更好地开展争取恢复南北正常关系的活动，各省、市普遍成立了“争取恢复南北正常关系委员会”。
    在吴庭艳政权统治下的南越，情况也不例外：承天省，半个月内就有七万人签名请愿，要求南越政权和越南民主共和国政府就普选问题进行协商；在中越南部地区有85％以上的人为此举行了罢工和罢市。从广治、广南、芹苴等许多省份传来的消息说，南越人民衷心拥护越南民主共和国总理府8月1日的声明。人们说：经过三年的建设竞赛，我们知道该选择哪种社会制度。有人还根据南越报刊发表的正式统计材料，同北越建设成绩作了对比。它们已被摘要刊登在越南
  “统一报”和“独立报”上。仅仅举几个例子就够了：三年来，北越新建立了十八个现代化设备的工矿企业，全部恢复鸿基煤矿、海防水塔、南定纺织厂等十几个矿山和工厂。战争时期，在解放区建立的十八个工厂也都得到扩建。但是南越除了广南省的农山煤矿恢复生产以外，没有建立半个新企业。北越修复了五百七十五公里铁路，而南越只修复八十公里。1956年晚稻的收获量，北越是四百十三万二千吨，南越只三百五十一万四千六百二十吨。三年来，一向以出口大米著称的南越连连进口美国大米；北越却在去年开始第一次消灭历史上遗留下来的缺粮现象，并且还出口了部分大米。
    事实表明，南越的吴庭艳政权由于拒绝协商、拒绝恢复南北正常关系，在南越人民中间的处境已越来越孤立。如果它甘心继续充当美帝国主义的走卒、坚持分裂国家的政策，终将遭受全民的唾弃和世界舆论的指责而陷于不拔的境地。
