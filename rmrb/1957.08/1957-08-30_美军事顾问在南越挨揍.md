Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 29th: "The People's Daily" of Vietnam reported today the news of an American military advisor being severely beaten by a South Vietnamese officer.

Not long ago, several American military advisors went to inspect a barracks of Ngo Dinh Diem in Toulon. They cursed the soldiers’ guns for being unclean, and one American advisor even stuck his finger into a gun barrel full of oily mud, and then used his greasy finger to smear the nose of a South Vietnamese officer. This South Vietnamese officer could not tolerate this rude behavior, and hit the American advisor hard with his rifle butt, breaking one of his arms.

　　美军事顾问在南越挨揍
    据新华社河内29日电　越南“人民报”今天报道一个美国军事顾问遭到吴庭艳军官痛打的消息。
    不久以前，有几个美国军事顾问去检查土伦的一个吴庭艳的兵营。他们大骂士兵的枪支不干净，有一个美国顾问还把手指伸进充满油泥的枪筒，然后用油腻的手指去抹一个南越军官的鼻子。这个南越军官不能容忍这种无礼的态度，就用枪托猛打这个美国顾问，打断了他的一支胳膊。
