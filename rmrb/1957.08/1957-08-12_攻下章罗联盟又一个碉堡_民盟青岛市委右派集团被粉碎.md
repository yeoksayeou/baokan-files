    Another Stronghold of the Zhang-Luo Alliance Falls: The Rightist Clique of the China Democratic League Qingdao Municipal Committee is Smashed

    (Our dispatch) The Rectification Leading Group of the China Democratic League (CDL) Qingdao Municipal Committee recently held eleven enlarged symposiums, exposing the rightist clique headed by Chen Yangzhi, the first vice-chairman of the CDL Municipal Committee.

    The core members of this rightist clique, Chen Yangzhi, Huang Shudong, Xue Yinong, Feng Dexian, Lu Yunpeng, and Yang Zupei, all held important positions in the CDL Municipal Committee, the Qingdao Municipal Government organs, and the cultural and educational circles.

    This rightist clique was formed after the Second National Congress convened by the CDL Central Committee and consolidated after the CDL Central Committee's April meeting this year. They faithfully implemented the reactionary political program of the Zhang-Luo Alliance. Xue Yinong and Chen Yangzhi repeatedly declared that "the CDL's past role as an assistant was to be the tail of the Communist Party." Chen Yangzhi also clamored that "the CPPCC should become an upper house, and the CDL representatives attending the CPPCC should play the role of a parliamentary party group, changing the role of merely providing consultation."

    In order to expand their reactionary forces, this clique, after controlling the actual leadership of the CDL Municipal Committee, also actively wooed rightist elements in grassroots organizations as their pawns by means of "promising official positions and favors." After April this year, Chen Yangzhi, Huang Shudong, and others, under the guise of being responsible for preparing for the CDL Provincial Committee, repeatedly planned to arrange the main members of their clique in the main departments of the CDL Provincial Committee, attempting to control the CDL Provincial Committee.

    As early as last year, Chen Yangzhi instructed the cadres of the CDL Municipal Committee organs to "go deep" and collect the opinions of those who had been struggled against in the Three-Anti, Five-Anti, and Counter-Revolution Suppression movements, door-to-door, claiming that he would "reflect to the Party" and "revise the conclusions" for them. After the Party launched the rectification movement in May this year, this group of rightist elements maliciously attacked the Party with these "materials" that had been collected long ago.

    攻下章罗联盟又一个碉堡
    民盟青岛市委右派集团被粉碎
    本报讯　民盟青岛市委整风领导小组最近举行了十一次扩大座谈会，揭露以民盟市委第一副主任委员陈仰之为首的右派集团。
    这个右派集团的核心分子陈仰之、黄树栋、薛艺农、冯德先、卢云鹏和杨祖培等，都在民盟市委、青岛市政府机关和文教界担任重要的工作。
    这个右派集团是在民盟中央召开的第二次全国代表大会以后形成，今年民盟中央四月会议以后巩固起来的。他们忠实地执行了章罗联盟的反动政治纲领。薛艺农、陈仰之曾一再宣称“民盟过去的助手作用是作了共产党的尾巴”，陈仰之还扬言“政协要成为上议院，民盟代表出席政协要起议会党团的作用，要改变单是谘询的作用。”
    这个集团为了扩大反动势力，在控制了民盟市委的实际领导权以后，又积极在基层组织内以“封官许愿”的办法拉拢右派分子作为他们的爪牙。今年4月以后，陈仰之、黄树栋等人还以负责筹备民盟省委为名，多次策划将他们集团内的主要成员安排在民盟省委的各主要部门之内，企图把持民盟省委。
    陈仰之早在去年，就指示民盟市委机关干部要“深入”下去，挨门逐户地搜集在三反、五反、肃反等运动中被斗争的人的意见，声称要为他们“向党反映”，“修改结论”。今年5月党开展整风运动以后，这伙右派分子就把早就搜集来的这些“材料”向党进行了恶毒的攻击。　　　　　（新华社专稿）
