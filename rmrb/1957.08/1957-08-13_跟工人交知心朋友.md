Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 9th: The work in twenty-four key factories and mines in Yunnan Province has been improved to varying degrees during the rectification campaign.

    Several key factories and mines have streamlined their management organizations. The Kunming Machine Tool Plant merged the three laboratories of Machine Tool, Technology, and Central into one Research Laboratory; merged the Forging and Metallurgy Section and the Technology Section to strengthen the technical force; and merged the Planning and Accounting Sections into the Economic Section, eliminating the problems of unclear division of labor and unclear responsibilities.
    Hundreds of Party member cadres above the section chief level in these key factories and mines regularly participate in physical labor, and most factories and mines have already formed a system. Because the responsible Party member cadres participate in labor, they have helped workers solve many problems. For example, most of the Party member cadres in the Yunnan Iron Factory were previously workers of the fifth grade or above. After they directly participated in production in the workshop, they discovered that the average daily output of the water pipe section of the forging workshop was low and the scrap rate was about one-fourth. They then worked with the veteran workers to study improvement methods and held a workshop meeting to discuss them, which increased the average daily output by nearly one time and reduced the scrap rate by half. These leading cadres also promptly corrected some impractical leadership requirements and shortcomings in management work that they discovered during labor. The Party members of most key factories and mines have strengthened their ties with the masses. In the past month and a half, 80% of the Party members in the Kunming Smelter have extensively listened to the opinions and demands of the masses, helped the masses solve difficulties, and many have become the confidants of the masses.

    跟工人交知心朋友
    据新华社昆明9日电  云南省内二十四个重点厂矿的工作，在整风期间都有不同程度的改进。
    若干重点厂矿都已经精简了管理机构。昆明机床厂把机床、工艺、中央等三个试验室合并为一个研究试验室；把锻冶科和工艺科合并，加强了技术力量，又把计划、会计科合并为经济科，消除了分工不明、职责不清的毛病。
    这些重点厂矿的数百名科长以上的党员干部都经常参加体力劳动，其中大多数厂矿已经形成了制度。由于负责的党员干部参加劳动，帮助工人解决了不少问题。例如云南铁工厂的大多数党员负责干部，过去都是五级以上的工人，他们在车间里直接参加生产发现了锻工车间水管工段的平均日产量低、废品约占四分之一的情况以后，就和老工人一起研究改进办法，并召开工段大会加以讨论，使平均日产量增加了将近一倍，废品也减少了一半。这些领导干部在劳动中发现的领导上有些要求不合实际和管理工作中的缺点，也都及时纠正了。多数重点厂矿的党员都和群众加强了联系。昆明冶炼厂80％的党员，最近一个半月以来都广泛地听取群众的意见和要求，帮助群众解决困难，许多人已成为群众的知心朋友。
