    Boat

    The Yongding River flows torrentially between the two mountains. There is a small village under the cliffs on the north bank of the river, which is my hometown. When I was a child, I often heard the adults say, "This village is a poor village passed down from our ancestors. Living in this village is a waste of a lifetime." At that time, I was still ignorant and only knew that I ate chaff and wild vegetables every day. If I couldn't even eat that, I would cry, and my mother would secretly shed tears. Not only was my family like this, but every family lived a precarious life. At that time, I really didn't understand, only hearing the adults say "bitter fate."
    Later, when I became sensible, I realized that it was the result of feudal landlord oppression. The mountains are high and there is little land, and most of the land is on the southern mountain across the Yongding River. People couldn't afford to build boats, so they had to swim across the river to farm; therefore, the adults forced their children to learn to swim in the river. The people in our village all know how to swim in the river. In summer, regardless of whether the water is high or low, they have to go to the river to swim every day. In this way, the Yongding River drowned many children and adults who crossed the river to weed the fields. Some women thought of their drowned sons, some women thought of their drowned husbands, how sad they were! The people in the village often suffered from floods. Why not build a big boat? Just because the village is poor! After overthrowing the feudal landlords, we still haven't built a boat. This is because people's hearts are not united and life is not prosperous.
    This morning, the members of our agricultural cooperative were sitting on a boat, laughing and talking, and I was so excited! It was the first time I sat on the boat built by our cooperative. Looking at this big boat, I feel so happy! People have been waiting not for a day or two, not for a year or two, but for decades, and only today, on the great road of socialism, have we built this big boat. From now on, we can cross the river safely, and the members can take good care of the farmland.
    The big boat sailed on the green river, and unknowingly arrived at the south bank. (Attached picture)

    船
    王明起
    永定河在两山之间滚滚地流着。靠河的北岸山崖下有个小村，那就是我的家乡。我小时候常听大人们说：“这村是个祖辈传下的穷村子，人活在这村就算白来一世。”我那时还不太懂事，就知道每天吃糠吞野菜。如果连这也吃不上，我咧嘴就哭，妈妈也偷偷地垂泪。不但我家这样，每家都是过着朝不保夕的生活。那时我真不明白，只听大人们说“命苦”。
    后来我懂事了，才知道是受封建地主压迫的结果。山高土地少，土地大部分是在相隔永定河的南山上。人们造不起船，只有游水过河去种地；因此，大人们硬逼着孩子到河里去学游水。我们村的人都会在河里游泳。夏天不管水大、水小，天天要到河里去游。就这样，永定河水淹死很多小孩和渡河锄地的大人。有的妇女想起淹死的儿子，有的妇女想起淹死的丈夫，她们是多么伤心呀！村里的人们常受水的淹害。为什么不造一条大船呢？就因为村子穷嘛！打倒封建地主以后，还没造上船。这是因为人心不齐，生活没有富裕。
    今天早晨，我们农业社的社员坐了满满的一船，大家又说又笑，我心里是多么激动呀！我头一次坐在我们社里造的船上。我看着这大船，真觉得高兴！人们不是盼了一天两天，不是盼了一年两年，而是盼望了几十年，到今天走上社会主义的大路，才造了这条大船。从此，我们渡河可保安全，社员们可以很好地抚育庄田。
    青青的河水上行驶着大船，不知不觉到了南岸。（附图片）
