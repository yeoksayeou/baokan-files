Xinhua News Agency, August 26th, Moscow dispatch: The International Symposium on the Origin of Life on Earth, which opened in Moscow on August 19th, closed on the 24th. Academician Oparin of the Soviet Academy of Sciences briefed TASS reporters on the symposium's proceedings.

    Oparin pointed out that the discussions at this conference were of a concrete research nature rather than speculative. He said that scientists can no longer be satisfied with merely using speculation to study the evolutionary history of our planet. They want to examine our assumptions by observing modern natural phenomena or by recreating a certain stage of material development through experiments.

    Oparin said that the first stage of the conference mainly discussed the primitive forms of the simplest organisms on Earth. The discussion mainly revolved around the question of whether various complex organic combinations existed in the material before the formation of the planet. This question involves two hypotheses about whether our early Earth was "hot" or "cold." Most scholars have now concluded that organisms have been an integral part of the Earth since its inception.

    Oparin pointed out that although scientists have various views on some of the issues raised at the conference, everyone agrees on the evolutionary nature of matter, in which various forms of life emerged. However, the debate was heated on the question of whether life began with single molecules or complex molecules. We believe that the second hypothesis has more basis. This requires further experiments and continued exchange of experiences among scientists from various countries.

    Oparin said that many speakers talked about the question of whether the Earth's primitive atmosphere contained oxygen. It is most likely that the primitive atmosphere was not oxidizing but reducing. For example, interesting experiments by Japanese scientists using sulfate-reducing bacteria proved this point. These bacteria do not need oxygen but need sulfur, and these bacteria are related to the first stage of life's birth on Earth.

    Oparin went on to say that scientists are very interested in the question of whether experiments to artificially recreate life under experimental conditions can succeed. We can now give a positive answer to this question. Although artificially recreating the process of metabolism has not been completely successful, experiments by scientists in the Soviet Union, the United States, and many other countries have shown that it is possible under experimental conditions to create systems that are close to life in terms of their characteristics.

    Prominent scientists from Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, the United Kingdom, Hungary, East Germany, Canada, China, Romania, the Soviet Union, the United States, France, West Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Japan participated in this symposium.

### 奥巴林谈生命起源国际讨论会收获　人工制造生命大有可能　有机体从地球产生之始就是地球组成部分

    奥巴林谈生命起源国际讨论会收获
　　人工制造生命大有可能
　　有机体从地球产生之始就是地球组成部分
    新华社26日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：8月19日在莫斯科开幕的关于地球上生命起源的国际讨论会已经在24日闭幕。苏联学科院院士奥巴林向塔斯社记者介绍了讨论会进行的情况。
    奥巴林指出，这次会议的讨论具有具体研究而非臆测的性质。他说，现在科学家们已经不能满足于仅仅用臆测的方法来研究我们这个星球的演变史了。他们要用观察现代自然现象的方法或者通过实验使物质发展的某个阶段再现的方法，来检查我们的假设。
    奥巴林说，会议在第一个阶段主要讨论了地球上最简单的有机体的原始形态。讨论主要围绕着这样一个问题，即行星形成之前的物质是否存在着各种复杂的有机的结合。这个问题牵涉到我们地球初期是“热的”还是“冷的”两个假设。大部分学者现在得出了这样的结论：有机体从地球产生的一开始就是地球的组成部分。
    奥巴林指出，虽然科学家们对于会议上提出的部分问题有各种各样的观点，但是大家对于物质的进化性质的了解是一致的，在这个进化过程中出现了各种各样的生命。然而关于生命开始的时候是单个的分子还是综合的分子这一问题的争论很热烈。我们认为第二种假设的根据比较多一些。这还需要进一步的实验和各国科学家继续交流经验。
    奥巴林说，许多发言的人都谈到了这样一个问题：地球上的原始大气层是否含有氧气？最可能的是原始大气层没有氧化性质而有还原性质。例如日本科学家用硫酸盐还原性细菌所作的有趣的实验就证明了这点。这种细菌不需要氧气而需要硫黄，而这种细菌和地球上生命诞生的第一阶段有关系。
    奥巴林接着说，科学家们对在实验条件下人工再现生命的实验是否能成功的问题很感兴趣。对于这个问题现在我们已经可以给予肯定的回答。虽然人工再现新陈代谢过程还没有完全成功，但是苏联、美国和许多其他国家的科学家的实验表明，在实验条件下已经有办法制造就其特性而论接近于生命的系统。
    奥地利、比利时、保加利亚、英国、匈牙利、民主德国、加拿大、中国、罗马尼亚、苏联、美国、法国、西德、捷克斯洛伐克和日本的著名科学家们，参加了这次讨论会。
