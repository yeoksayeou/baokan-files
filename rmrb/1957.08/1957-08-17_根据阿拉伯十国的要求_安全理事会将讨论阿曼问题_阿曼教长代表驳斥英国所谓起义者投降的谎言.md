Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch from New York: The United Nations Security Council will meet on August 20 to discuss the Oman issue. This meeting of the Security Council was decided upon based on a formal request made by ten Arab countries.

On August 15, these ten Arab countries submitted a note to the President of the Security Council, requesting the Security Council to take immediate action regarding the British armed aggression against Oman.

The note stated that Britain had adopted a form of total war in an attempt to eliminate Oman's sovereign status, while Oman's independent status had already been confirmed in the Treaty of Seeb.

The ten countries that signed the note were Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.

Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch from Cairo: On the 15th, the representative of the Imam of Oman in Cairo, Harsey, refuted the British propaganda lie that the Omani rebels had surrendered.

Harsey issued a statement saying: "The British statement regarding the surrender of Omani nationalists was issued immediately after Arab countries filed an appeal with the United Nations Security Council requesting a halt to the British offensive. Obviously, the purpose of issuing such a false statement is to give the world and the Security Council the impression that the matter to be debated no longer exists."

Harsey said that the Omani rebels do not know what surrender means and they are fighting bravely.

Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch from Bahrain: The British Air Force attacked the village of Sait, the hometown of the Imam of Oman, on the 15th, destroying the village's fortresses and towers. Sait village is in the Akhdar Mountains, northwest of Nizwa.

According to a British official spokesman in Bahrain, the attack on the Imam of Oman's hometown was mainly for so-called "psychological effect." The spokesman also announced that two small villages in the Omani interior had also been subjected to heavy air raids. The British Air Force flew a total of fifteen sorties that day.

Robertson, the British commander suppressing the Omani uprising, said in Nizwa on the 15th that "I am only prepared to withdraw British troops" after there are enough Muscat troops here and after the political situation returns to favor the Sultan.

    根据阿拉伯十国的要求
    安全理事会将讨论阿曼问题
    阿曼教长代表驳斥英国所谓起义者投降的谎言
    新华社16日讯  纽约消息：联合国安全理事会将在8月20日开会讨论阿曼问题。安理会的这次会议是根据十个阿拉伯国家正式提出的要求而决定召开的。
    这十个阿拉伯国家8月15日在给安全理事会主席的一份照会中，要求安全理事会对英国武装侵略阿曼一事立即采取行动。
    照会说，英国采取了全面战争形式企图消灭阿曼的主权地位，而阿曼的独立地位是已经在西卜条约中得到了确认的。
    在照会上签字的十个国家是埃及、伊拉克、约旦、黎巴嫩、利比亚、摩洛哥、沙特阿拉伯、苏丹、叙利亚和也门。
    新华社16日讯  开罗消息：阿曼教长驻开罗代表哈尔塞15日驳斥了英国宣传所谓阿曼起义者已经投降的谎言。
    哈尔塞发表声明说：“英国关于阿曼民族主义者已经投降的声明是紧接在阿拉伯国家向联合国安全理事会提出申诉要求制止英国的进攻以后发表的。显然，发表这种虚假的声明的目的是要使全世界和安全理事会获得这种印象：将要辩论的事情不再存在了。”
    哈尔塞说，阿曼起义者不知道什么叫做投降，他们正在勇敢地战斗。
    新华社16日讯  巴林消息：英国空军15日袭击了阿曼教长的故乡赛特村，击毁了这个村庄的堡垒和楼塔。赛特村在阿赫达尔山区，尼兹瓦的西北方。
    据在巴林的英国官方发言人说，对阿曼教长故乡的袭击主要是为了所谓“心理上的作用”。这个发言人还宣布，阿曼内地的两个小村庄也受到了严重的空袭。英国空军这一天总共出动了十五架次。
    镇压阿曼起义者的英国指挥官罗伯逊15日在尼兹瓦说，只有在这里有了足够的马斯喀特部队以及在政局恢复到有利于苏丹以后，“我才准备撤走英国军队”。
