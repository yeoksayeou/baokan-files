Ningxiang Shuangjiangkou Grain Station
Why did it Exceed Grain Sales Target by Over 600,000 Jin?

(Our dispatch) By July 9th, the Shuangjiangkou Grain Station in Ningxiang, Hunan, had exceeded its sales target by more than 669,000 jin, and it is estimated that it will exceed 1.2 million jin by the time of the new harvest.

The Shuangjiangkou Grain Station is responsible for the grain supply of Shuangjiangkou, Lianhuashan, and Quantang three townships. These three townships are concentrated rice-producing areas. After last year's procurement, the average grain retained by the masses was over 600 jin, and the Yuexing Agricultural Cooperative retained as much as 800 jin. The retained grain should be enough to eat. However, since the beginning of summer, the supply at this grain station has become tight, and the supply volume has increased sharply. The average daily sales in June reached more than 100,000 jin, with a maximum of 150,000 jin. With the tightening of supply, a black market appeared, with the black market price of rice as high as 16.7 yuan per 100 jin, more than double the listed price. There were also many sales of revolving grain coupons, with a profit of 3 to 5 yuan for every 100 jin of revolving grain coupons purchased. According to investigations, the following are the main reasons for this serious situation:

First, some landlords, rich peasants, and farmers with capitalist ideas took advantage of the grain shortage of a few households to create an atmosphere of grain shortage and engage in grain speculation. The main methods of speculation were to dismantle, exchange, and alter grain coupons. Many households dismantled old grain coupons, removed purchased pages and replaced them with blank new ones; removed pages with small numbers and replaced them with pages with larger numbers; some added numbers in the blank spaces to increase the amount of grain purchased; some changed pen writing with ink pen; some carried out patching and alterations; some even used chemical agents to illegally alter the coupons; some privately carved the seals of grain station cadres and added them to the grain coupons with the altered numbers. For example, Zhang Jianqin, a landlord in Yuexing Cooperative, sold 3,600 jin of revolving coupons, earning a profit of 80 yuan. Because these townships had a bumper harvest last year, the grain station cadres were blindly optimistic, and even the number of revolving grain was not registered at the time. Later, the distribution of coupons was handled by each agricultural cooperative "according to conscience." In addition, some revolving coupons were over-issued and lost.

The cadres held right-leaning sentiments towards the grain speculation activities that occurred and did not crack down on serious offenders. Some cooperative cadres even took the lead and encouraged cooperative members to engage in grain speculation. As a result, evil winds prevailed, and individual cooperatives even regarded grain speculation as a way to develop sideline production, with cooperative cadres personally taking charge, such as Hu Fusheng (Party Branch Secretary of the township), the director of Yuexing Cooperative.

Currently, the Ningxiang County Party Committee has conducted an inspection of these violations and has taken measures to correct them.

### 宁乡双江口粮站  为什么突破售粮指标六十多万斤？

    宁乡双江口粮站
    为什么突破售粮指标六十多万斤？
    本报讯　湖南宁乡双江口粮站到7月9日，已突破销售指标六十六万九千多斤，估计到接新时要突破一百二十万斤。
    双江口粮站，负责双江口、莲花山、泉塘三个乡的粮食供应，这三个乡是稻谷集中产区，去年征购后群众实留粮平均在六百斤以上，月星农业社留粮达到了八百斤，留粮应该是够吃的。但是，在入夏以来，这个粮站的供应便开始紧张，供应量急剧增加，6月份日销平均达十万余斤，最高时达到十五万斤。随着供应紧张市场出现了黑市，每百斤稻谷黑市价高达十六元七角，高出牌价两倍。周转粮证贩卖的也很多，买一百斤周转粮证，可得三元至五元。出现这样严重的情况，据检查有以下几个原因。
    首先是一部分地主富农分子和有资本主义思想的农民，趁着少数户缺粮，制造粮食紧张空气，进行粮食投机活动。投机活动的方式主要是拆换和涂改粮证，有不少的户将旧粮证拆开，把买了的抽掉换上空的新页；把数字小的抽掉，换上数字大的页码；有的从空格中加数字，增加购粮数；有的用墨笔改水笔字；有的进行挖补更改；有的甚至用化学药水非法更改；有的私刻粮站干部图章，在粮证加盖已经改大的数字。如月星社地主张鉴钦出卖了三千六百斤周转证，获利八十元。由于这几个乡去年丰收，粮站干部因此盲目乐观，甚至周转粮的数目当时就没有登记，以后发证是由各农业社“凭良心”办事。另外还多发和遗失了一些周转证。
    干部对发生的粮食投机活动存在右倾情绪，对严重犯法分子也不进行打击。有的社干部还带头和鼓舞社员搞粮食投机。致使邪风猖狂，个别社还把粮食投机作为副业生产的门路，社干亲自出马，如月星社主任胡福生（党乡支书记）就是这样。
    目前宁乡县委对这些违犯行为进行了检查，并已采取措施纠正。
