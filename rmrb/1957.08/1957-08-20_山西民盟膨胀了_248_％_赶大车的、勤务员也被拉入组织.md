The Shanxi Democratic League's Expansion Reaches 248%
Cart Drivers and Orderlies Pulled into the Organization

    So far, 63 rightists have been exposed in the Shanxi Province Democratic League organization, most of whom were new members who joined during the period of "major expansion." Among these rightists, 53 had previously participated in reactionary parties and groups, and the rest were mostly landlords, rich peasants, and bureaucratic capitalists.

    Since the proposal of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" for the democratic parties last year, the Shanxi Province Democratic League organization has expanded by 248% on its original basis in a short period. This was mainly due to the efforts of Wang Wenguang, vice chairman of the Shanxi Provincial Democratic League, who personally "conquered the north and subdued the south" to develop the organization. The practice of indiscriminate recruitment was very serious, with many people filling out forms in batches and not writing autobiographies. In the past, the Democratic League had no local organizations in Shanxi except in Taiyuan, but now new local branches have been established in many places.

    In order to "develop more" and "expand greatly" the Democratic League organization, Wang Wenguang did not hesitate to use promises of official positions, utilize kinship, and other means to entice, win over, and deceive people into joining the League.

    Liu Guiyan, a member of the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Democratic League, revealed: "Wang Wenguang recruited people everywhere. Among the League members he developed were correspondents, orderlies, and even cart drivers." He also said to me, "You have to be thick-skinned, what are you afraid of? It's to our advantage to bring them in." Sometimes he wouldn't let people leave until after 10 p.m., insisting that they agree to take application forms before he would stop.

    Wang Wenguang deceived people into joining the League by saying, "Joining the League can lead to job introductions, and those with difficult living conditions will receive relief. Intellectuals have been helpless orphans for many years, and only joining the League will give you your own parents." Wang Wenguang also said that the development of the League's organization should have: "The standpoint of the working class, the demeanor of intellectuals, and the style of small merchants."

    Wang Wenguang's activities also extended to small and medium-sized towns. Zhang Yong, a teacher at Yangquan Middle School, said: "Wang Wenguang was my teacher twenty years ago. This time, as soon as we met, he bragged about how he had been busy for the Democratic League and the revolution for twenty years as always. Because of our teacher-student relationship, he asked me to join the League. I said I wanted to join the Party. He said, 'I'll tell you a secret: the Communist Party isn't recruiting anymore.' He also said that joining the League would be more respected than joining the Party, and I would be sitting at the front of any provincial meeting." Doctor Lü Changsheng said: "Wang Wenguang recruits League members by just tapping them on the head. He personally came to my house to mobilize me, the sooner the better. I suggested that I wanted to discuss it with my comrades, but he objected."

    Sun Dongyuan, vice chairman of the Changzhi Municipal Democratic League, revealed: When Wang Wenguang came to Changzhi to develop the Democratic League, he specifically collected opinions of dissatisfaction with the Party. He treated those who were subject to the anti-Rightist campaign as if they were his relatives, using a hypocritical and compassionate demeanor to inquire about the situation of the anti-Rightist campaign and seek opinions on it.

### 山西民盟膨胀了248％  赶大车的、勤务员也被拉入组织

    山西民盟膨胀了248％
    赶大车的、勤务员也被拉入组织
    到目前为止，山西省民盟组织中已经揭露出六十三个右派分子，其中大部分是“大发展”中入盟的新盟员。在这些右派分子中，过去曾经参加过反动党团的有五十三人，其他多为地主、富农、官僚资本家等。
    从去年提出各民主党派“长期共存，互相监督”以后，短短一段时间山西省民盟组织在原有基础上发展了248％。其中主要是右派分子、民盟山西省副主委王文光自己“南征北战”发展的。发展中拉夫现象非常严重，很多是成批填表，不写自传。过去民盟在山西除太原以外，没有地方组织，现在在许多地方新建立了地方支部。
    王文光为了“多发展”、“大发展”民盟组织，不惜用封官许愿利用亲朋关系等等手段来诱惑、拉拢、欺骗人入盟。
    民盟太原市常委柳贵炎揭发说：“王文光到处拉夫，在他发展的盟员中有通讯员、勤务员，还有赶大车的。”他还对我说，“你们要脸皮厚一些，怕什么，发展进来就是咱们的便宜。”有时晚上十点多钟，还不让人家走，硬要他们答应领申请入盟表以后才罢。
    王文光欺骗入盟的人说：“参加盟可以介绍工作，生活困难的会得到救济，知识分子多年是无依无靠的没娘孩，只有加入盟才是自己的亲爹亲娘。”王文光还说：发展盟的组织时应该具有：“工人阶级立场，知识分子风度，小商人作风。”
    王文光的活动还深入到中小城镇中去。阳泉中学教师张勇说：王文光是我二十年前的老师。这次一见面，他就吹嘘他为民盟为革命奔忙二十年如一日。看在师生面上，叫我入盟。我说我想入党。他就说：“我告你个秘密消息，共产党不发展了。”他又说入了党还不如入盟受尊重，省里开什么会我坐在前头。医生吕畅生说：王文光来发展盟员是摸摸脑瓜就是一个。他还亲自到我家动员我，越快越好，我提出要和同志们商量商量，他也反对。
    民盟长治市孙东元副主委揭发：王文光来长治发展民盟，专门搜集对党不满的意见，见了肃反对象就像见了亲人，用猫哭老鼠的假慈悲面貌打听肃反的情况，搜寻对肃反的意见。
