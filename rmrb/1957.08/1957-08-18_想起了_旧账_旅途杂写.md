    Remembering "Old Debts"
    ——Travel Jottings
    Liu Housheng

    My journey took me from Shanghai to Hangzhou, and then to Shaoxing. The trip was hurried, and I didn't have deep contact with anything, nor detailed, long conversations with anyone. Yet, in this coming and going, a character like the "little husband" that Lu Xun described in the preface to "Old Tales Retold," "appearing between Nüwa's legs," was constantly jumping around in my mind. He waved his mantis-like arms with their sharp barbs, standing beside the enormous wheels (poor fellow, he wasn't even as tall as a nail on the wheel), roaring furiously: "You're blocking my way, I'm going to settle old scores with you!"

    All along the way, I kept thinking about settling old scores, and the old account books turned page after page before my eyes.

    As I entered the station, I remembered my past experiences with trains. Before liberation, in the few train journeys I took, I gained two kinds of experience: one had to have the skill to climb into the train through the window; and if one was lucky enough to get a seat, one had to swear to never leave it or one's luggage, unless a "tiger skin" (i.e., a powerful person) came along, in which case it was best to get out of the way as soon as possible. This, of course, was just the most basic "might makes right." Perhaps we can mention these things today with some wry smiles. But let us recall the situation at Shanghai North Station after the "August 13th Incident" and in the months before Shanghai's liberation when the Kuomintang reactionaries forced the people to flee. How many people sitting on the train roofs, on the back, and underneath the cars were scraped off and crushed to death when going over bridges and through tunnels! How many people were separated from their families, their wives and children lost, weeping for their fathers and mothers! Who can think of such a tragic state without anger! But at this time, our "heroes" were planning to "go up the mountain" to become "commander-in-chiefs" to increase the suffering of the people.

    I arrived in Hangzhou, the pearl in the palm of our people's hands. But the beautiful West Lake has been subjected to so much filth for thousands of years! From Zhao Gou and Jia Sidao, I thought all the way to Chiang Kai-shek, and that "upholding justice" Zhejiang Province's "Chairman" Lord Huang Shaohong. Besides playing with and insulting our West Lake maiden, besides leaving behind the most contemptible and hateful memories, what else did they do? Today, I drift on a small boat on the lake, feeling broad-minded and comfortable. Everywhere I look, I see honest, open-hearted working people enjoying themselves. I no longer need to worry about the alienation and mutual distrust evoked by wealthy travelers flaunting their wealth and despising the working class, the "scraping cucumber rinds" phenomenon. I no longer need to be afraid of being followed. The heavy, dark gate that Lu Xun once shouldered will never threaten us again.

    I stayed in a hotel and couldn't sleep at night, and I thought about the past and present of hotels in Shanghai and Hangzhou. I thought of the luxurious hotel where Chen Bailu stayed in "Sunrise," and also the dark little inn where Lin Daiyu stayed in "Night Shop." The scene doesn't need to be depicted. And now, I am leafing through a guest opinion book. The first page reads: "Your hotel is clean and sanitary, and the service attitude of the staff is very good. Worthy of praise!"

    I took a pedicab in Shaoxing, and as I passed a bridge, I saw a person coming towards the pedicab from afar. They ran to the back of the pedicab and pushed it up the bridge. I quickly said, "No need," wanting to jump down and walk across. The comrade in the pedicab with me also stopped me and said, "No need." Before I knew it, the pedicab had reached the top of the bridge and was speeding down. My companion told me that this was a mutual aid organization of local pedicab workers, and there was no need to pay extra. I couldn't help but think back to the situation on Shanghai's Ferry Bridge and Sichuan Road Bridge. To compete for pushing a pedicab, how many beggars covered in mud and sweat often ended up fighting each other to the death. To fight for a penny or two, how many upsetting arguments would occur between the pullers, the passengers, and the pushers. But even above these miserable beggars, there were actually mob bosses sitting on the ground dividing the spoils. What kind of life was that!

    I watched a play in the theater where our troupe performed, and I thought back to the history of the Kuomintang army automatically watching plays for free and the navy "heroically" attacking its stage. I drank tea and chatted with the actors of our troupe in a teahouse, and I couldn't help but think of the experiences of Liu Xikui, Ruan Lingyu, Xiao Dangui, as well as Shen Fengxi, Wei Liansheng, and Fang Zhenzhu. These people should come and give a lesson to our Professor Chen Renbing, and get to know him, he specializes in focusing on "cultivating" and developing members of the China Democratic League among the leading actors.

    In the cultural relics exhibition room of the Lu Xun Memorial Hall, I saw even more shockingly the epitome of an entire dark age. Let me just quote the materials in a clipping photo in a frame: "Nearly 100 Communists executed in Shanghai," "Guangzhou military police suddenly surrounded and arrested Communists, killing 100 and arresting 1,000," "Li Dazhao and 20 others hanged"... As I was copying these titles onto a small notebook, my hand began to tremble. Young people, do you know that many right-wing elements have fired guns, made "meritorious" contributions, and drunk our blood in this? My heart beat faster and faster, and I wished I could drag these gentlemen here to see. I eagerly want to tell all good people: If you want to settle old scores, this is what you should settle! We have been generous and already decided not to settle them, but if you must settle them, then settle these!

    想起了“旧账”
    ——旅途杂写
    刘厚生
    我的路程是由上海到杭州，再到绍兴。旅途匆匆，什么事物也没有深入的接触，什么人也没有细致的长谈，然而就是这样地去去来来，在我脑海中却有一个像鲁迅先生在“故事新编”序中所说的“在女娲的两腿之间出现”的“小丈夫”那样的角色时时刻刻在跳动。他挥舞着像螳螂似的带着尖刺的双臂，站在巨大的车轮旁边（可怜他还没有车轮上的一颗钉子高），气吼吼地嗥叫着：你挡着了我的路，我要与你算算旧账！
    我一路上不停地想到算旧账的事情，老账本不由得一页一页地在我眼前翻过。
    我走进车站，就想起从前坐火车的账。解放以前，我在仅有几次的铁路旅行中，却得到了两种经验：上车要有从车窗子里爬进去的本领；侥幸占了一个座位就誓死不离开座位和自己的行李，除非来了一个“老虎皮”，那还是趁早躲开为妙。这当然只是最起码的唯强者有理而已。也许我们今天还可以带着些苦笑提到这些事。可是让我们回想一下“八一三”之后和上海解放前几个月，国民党反动派强迫老百姓逃难时的上海北站情况吧。多少人坐在火车顶上、后边和车底下，在过桥过山洞时给刮了下来摔死压死！多少人妻离子散，寻父哭娘！谁想起了这种惨状能不愤怒！但这时我们的“英雄”们却正在打算“上山”去当“总司令”以增加人民的痛苦哩。
    我到了杭州，这是我们人民最钟爱的掌上明珠。但美丽的西子湖千百年来蒙受了多少污垢啊！我从赵构、贾似道一直想到了蒋介石，还有那位“主持正义”的浙江省的“主席”大人黄绍竑，他们除了玩弄和侮辱我们的西湖女儿，除了留下最令人唾弃厌恶的记忆之外，还有什么呢？今天我在湖上小舟荡漾，觉得胸襟开阔，心情舒坦，举眼望去，都是些心地光明的劳动人民在游玩，我再也不用耽心由于旅客们摆阔、对劳动者贱视所激起的“刨黄瓜儿”这种人与人互不信任的隔阂了。我再也不用害怕背后有人盯梢了。曾经被鲁迅先生所肩负的沉重的黑暗的闸门，再也不会威胁我们了。
    我住在一家旅馆里，晚上睡不着，又想起上海、杭州这些地方的旅馆的今昔。我想到了“日出”里陈白露所住过的豪华的大饭店，也想到了“夜店”里林黛玉所栖身的阴暗的小栈房，那景象是用不着描绘的；而我现在，却在翻阅着一本旅客意见簿，第一页上就写着：贵馆清洁卫生，服务员的服务态度非常好，值得表扬！
    我在绍兴坐三轮车，走过一个桥，远远就望见一个人迎车而来，抄到车后就推车上桥。我忙说“不用”，想跳下来走过去。同车的同志拦住我也说“不用”，愕然之间车已到了桥顶，疾驰而下。同行者告诉我说，这是当地三轮车工人的互助组织，不用另外给钱的。我不禁遥想到从前上海的摆渡桥，四川路桥的情况了。为了争推一辆三轮车，多少个浑身流着泥汗的乞讨者常常弄得自相残杀；为了争取一分两分钱，踏车的、坐车的和推车的会发生多少令人难过的口舌。但就在这些悲惨的乞讨者之上，竟也还有坐地分赃的流氓把头在剥削。这是什么样的生活！
    我在我们剧团演出的剧场里看戏，就想起了当年国民党军队自动免费看戏，海军“英勇”进攻其舞台的历史；我与我们剧团的演员们在茶馆里喝茶，谈笑风生，也不由得想到刘喜奎、阮玲玉、筱丹桂以及沈凤喜、魏莲生和方珍珠这些人物的遭遇。应该让这些人来给我们的陈仁炳教授上上课，结识一下吧，他是专门在主要演员里重点“培养”、发展民盟盟员的。
    在鲁迅纪念馆的文物陈列室，更是触目惊心地看到了整个一个黑暗时代的缩影。让我仅仅引用一个镜框里的剪报照片中的材料吧：“沪枪决共产党近百人”、“广州军警，突然围捕共产党，击毙百人，逮捕千人”、“李大钊等二十人处绞”……当我在小册子上刚抄下这几个标题时，我的手颤抖起来了。青年们，你们知不知道，有不少右派分子都曾在这其中放过枪，立过“功”，喝过我们的血的。我的心越跳越激动，我恨不得能把这些老爷们扯到这里来看看，我急切地想告诉所有善良的人们：要算旧账，这才是旧账！我们宽宏大量，原已是不算的了，你们一定要算，那就算算吧！
