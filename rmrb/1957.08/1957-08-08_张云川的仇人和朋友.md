Zhang Yunchuan's Enemies and Friends
	Hu Yihe

At the end of 1953, the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party published an editorial in "Study and Work," emphasizing that democratic parties must loyally accept the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and severely criticizing some ideas of "ruling the country on an equal footing" and "sharing power equally." Zhang Yunchuan, then a member of the Central Executive Bureau of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, was very angry after reading the editorial. In a letter to a cadre of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, he said: "What misfortune to be a member of a democratic party! According to the viewpoint of this editorial, members of democratic parties must accept the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and if they do not accept the leadership of the Communist Party, it seems they should be thrown into the eighteenth level of hell." At the end of the letter, he asked the cadre to "pay attention" to the editorial and instructed with ulterior motives: This letter "should be destroyed after reading."
	This is the true face of Zhang Yunchuan, who repeatedly says he will not oppose the Party or socialism.

"I'd rather be hanged" than be led by Communists

In public, Zhang Yunchuan's methods were more subtle. On the one hand, he said he would accept the leadership of the Communist Party, and on the other hand, he completely denied the leadership of the Communist Party. In March of this year, the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party held a national working conference. Zhang Yunchuan said at a group meeting: We must accept the leadership of the Communist Party; however, accepting the leadership of the Party does not mean accepting the leadership of Communist Party members. There are more than ten million Communist Party members. It is already difficult enough for a daughter-in-law to be governed by one mother-in-law, and now she has to be governed by more than ten million mothers-in-law. I'd rather be hanged than do that! Zhang Yunchuan was agitated and furious when he said this.
	Zhang Yunchuan's intention in saying these words is also very clear. First, he compared Communist Party members to some "ferocious" mothers-in-law in the old society and non-Party members to tortured daughters-in-law, attempting to provoke the relationship between the masses and Communist Party members. Another more important point is to try to separate the Party's leadership and the Party members who embody the Party's leadership, and the Party's policies from the Party members who implement the policies, which actually denies the Party's leadership. At the same group meeting, he also spread such vicious reactionary remarks, saying: "Is it possible that every Communist Party member has a high level? To be honest, many Communist Party members are not as good as me, and I can lead many Communist Party members."
	Zhang Yunchuan, who calls himself "able to lead many Communist Party members," also has a special aversion to the saying that "Communist Party members are made of special materials." He said: "Thinking that 'Communist Party members are made of special materials' is the same mistake as Hitler's saying 'the Germanic nation is the most excellent nation in the world.'" In these places, Zhang Yunchuan and Zhang Bojun often echoed each other. For example, at a meeting of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party on July 7, 1956, Zhang Bojun said: "Thinking that 'Communist Party members are made of special materials' is a damn bastard's statement. I am fundamentally opposed to it. I used to be a Communist Party member, and I didn't feel that I was made of special materials." At the same meeting, Zhang Bojun said, "Proposing to overthrow the Chinese Communist Party is illegal, and I disagree; however, if someone advocates not accepting the leadership of the Communist Party and wanting to share power equally with the Communist Party, that is acceptable, because it is not illegal and will not affect his position and status." These words were truly "deeply in my heart" for Zhang Yunchuan, who believed that "if one does not accept the leadership of the Communist Party, it seems that he should be thrown into the eighteenth level of hell."

Looking at Activists with Gnashing Teeth

Zhang Yunchuan, who "hates the Communists like an enemy," also hates activists who are close to the Party with gnashing teeth. On the afternoon of July 6 last year, he said at a meeting of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party: "Things are bad because of some so-called activists. They take advantage of loopholes in the Communist Party, cause trouble, and I never tell these people the truth. To put it bluntly, I adopt an attitude of 'respecting ghosts and gods but keeping them at a distance' towards them. The Communist Party believes these people, listens to only one side, and encourages them in tangible and intangible ways. This not only does not help the democratic parties to distinguish right from wrong, but also encourages the disunity of the democratic parties. In the eyes of the Communist Party, spineless people are considered progressive, and people who are not spineless have problems. This has been the case since liberation, and it is intentional to cultivate servility. The Communist Party's practice has in fact made many honest people very servile and many smart people slippery." From this, it can also be seen that it was not accidental that he scolded the activists who were close to the Party at the symposium of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee this year as Tang Qin in "The Case of Judge Shi Tou" and the "dare-to-die corps" who dug ditches in the walls. At the same time, his letter to the People's Daily on May 31, stating that the "so-called activists" he mentioned in his speech referred to "fake activists," was also a thorough lie. Here, I would like to quote his own words as evidence. At a meeting of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, after scolding the activists who were close to the Party, he said in a threatening tone: "There are several such people in the People's Democratic League, and there are also many in the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. Who are they? Who runs to the United Front Work Department? I don't need to say it, everyone knows." These words clearly showed his attempt to threaten activists not to be close to the Party and to isolate the Party from the masses. This also shows that his statement at the group meeting of the National People's Congress that "the activists I mentioned in my speech at the United Front Work Department, although referring to fake activists, also affected the real activists approaching the Party" was a shameless sophistry.

Vicious attacks began a year ago

The rightists only allow others to talk about the shortcomings and mistakes of the Communist Party and do not allow them to talk about the advantages and achievements. This did not begin this year when they helped the CPC rectify its work. From the end of June to the beginning of July last year, Zhang Yunchuan, Wang Yifan, Huang Xianfan, Li Jiansheng, etc. (all of whom are rightists) focused their attacks on the Communist Party and the Party's united front work at a meeting of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. Ji Fang expressed his disagreement with their views, believing that the achievements of the Communist Party and the Party's united front work were the main aspect, and the shortcomings and mistakes were the secondary aspect. These rightists immediately surrounded and attacked Ji Fang. Wang Yifan said: "Even Chairman Mao said there are shortcomings and mistakes. Can you deny Chairman Mao's words!" Zhang Yunchuan said: "I don't like talking about 'achievements are the main aspect, and shortcomings are the secondary aspect.' This has become a cliché. Even Dulles knows it! I object to always singing praises to the Communist Party." Zhang Yunchuan's statement at the group meeting of the National People's Congress that "I praise the new atmosphere less because I have ideological problems and think everyone knows the achievements" is also a lie.

Attempting to Exculpate Himself

Zhang Yunchuan's attitude when talking about the issue of developing the organization of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party at the group meeting of the National People's Congress was also extremely dishonest. He said that Zhang Bojun had "personal intentions, and we were just being used to echo him." This is him trying to exculpate himself. After the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision was put forward, Zhang Bojun more than once advocated abolishing the "defense zone system" (he was referring to the division of labor and focus of various democratic parties in developing organizations and carrying out work), advocating large-scale development at all levels, upper, middle, and lower. Zhang Yunchuan was also extremely supportive of this at the time. On November 7 last year, when the Central Executive Bureau of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party held a meeting to discuss the issue of developing the organization, most people opposed abolishing the so-called "defense zone system," advocating that the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party should still focus on medical and health personnel, but Zhang Yunchuan opposed it, believing that this would limit development and "lag behind" other democratic parties. Zhang Bojun attached great importance to this opinion and played such a two-faced trick when the meeting was about to end: in a letter to the United Front Work Department, he agreed to focus on medical and health personnel, but in actual implementation, it should be flexibly grasped. This was in November last year. As early as July 7 last year, Zhang Yunchuan had proposed at the meeting: the rigid rules and regulations on developing the organization must be broken. Always using the Yellow River as a boundary and sticking to conventions will not lead to giving play to the role of "mutual supervision." Why not establish organizations in Xi'an, Shandong, Henan, Tianjin, and Baoding? I think they should all be established. If there are not enough cadres, first hanging up a sign of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party can also play a propaganda role and expand influence.
	In May of this year, Zhang Bojun, Huang Qixiang, Li Boqiu, etc. started fires in Beijing, and Zhang Yunchuan hurriedly ran to Henan to start fires, taking the opportunity of helping the CPC rectify its work to first hang up a sign of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, recruit troops and buy horses, and gather dissatisfied elements to attack the Party. Can it be said that this was all being "used" by Zhang Bojun? Was it just "echoing him"?

Look at the kind of people he associates with

Zhang Yunchuan's hatred of the Communist Party and socialism is not accidental. He was born into a family of tyrannical landlords. His father was a tyrant and was called "Fourth Tyrant" by the local peasants. Zhang Yunchuan grew up in this family and has always been an enemy of the peasants. Even after liberation, he still spoke from the standpoint of the landlord class, always emphasizing the shortcomings of the land reform, and was dissatisfied with the policy of unified purchase and sale, etc. From 1939, he often came to Beijing, which was occupied by the Japanese, and had contacts with the vice chairman of the traitor organization—the New People's Association, Yu Xijie, and the chief of general affairs, Peng Limin, etc., and had close relations with He Qigong (who had served as the mayor of Beijing and once served as Chiang Kai-shek's representative after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan). During the fall of Beijing, he established a deep relationship with Zhang Dongsun, which lasted until after liberation. Zhang Dongsun once said to others: "Yunchuan and I are close friends who talk about everything." In 1945, he asked someone to send 40,000 yuan of puppet currency to Zhang Dongsun, saying that it was sent by Hao Pengju, indicating that they also had economic contacts with traitors. Zhang Bojun once attempted to create a situation of "three divisions of the world" in China, and Zhang Yunchuan also "yearned for it." Not long before the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he had analyzed the situation after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, saying that if we opposed the Kuomintang and the Communist Party fighting, we would get the "support" of the people. He also said that if the third party also had armed forces, it could play a greater role in the future situation.
	Zhang Yunchuan is a member of the rightist group, a "fierce general" against the Party and socialism. His anti-Party and anti-socialist face is very hideous and very ferocious. We must wage the most resolute struggle against him!

    张云川的仇人和朋友
    胡一禾
    1953年底，农工民主党江西省委员会出版的“学习与工作”上有一篇社论，强调民主党派必须忠诚地接受中国共产党的领导，严厉地批驳了一些“分庭抗礼”和“平分秋色”的思想。身为农工民主党中央执行局委员的张云川，看了这篇社论后非常气愤，他在写给农工民主党中央宣传部一个干部的信里说：“生何不幸，作了一个民主党派的成员！照这篇社论的观点看来，民主党派的成员就非接受中国共产党的领导不可，如若不接受共产党的领导，似乎就应被打入十八层地狱。”在信的末尾，他要这位干部“注意”这篇社论，并怀鬼胎地嘱咐说：这封信“看后即予销毁”。
    这就是口口声声地说他不会反党反社会主义的张云川的真面目。
    受共产党员领导“吊死也不干”
    在公开场合，张云川的手法要巧妙一些。他一面说要接受共产党的领导，一面又全盘否定共产党的领导。今年3月，农工党中央召开了一次全国工作会议。张云川在小组会上说：我们要接受共产党的领导；但是，接受党的领导并不是说要接受共产党员的领导，共产党员有一千多万，一个媳妇受一个婆婆的管辖就已经够难受的了，现在还要受一千多万个婆婆的管辖，就是把我吊死了也不干！张云川在讲这番话时语气激愤，怒形于色。
    张云川说这些话的用意也是很明显的。首先，他把共产党员比之于旧社会里的某些“凶神恶煞”的婆婆，把党外人士比之于遭受折磨的媳妇，企图挑拨群众和共产党员的关系。另外更重要的一点，是企图把党的领导和体现党的领导的党员，把党的政策同执行政策的党员分割开来，实际上还是否定共产党的领导的。在同次小组会上，他还更恶毒地散布这样的反动言论说：“难道说每个共产党员的水平都很高吗？说老实话，有许多共产党员就不如我，我就可以领导很多共产党员”。
    自命为“可以领导很多共产党员”的张云川，对“共产党员是由特殊材料做成的”这句话也持有特别的反感。他说：“认为‘共产党员是由特殊材料做成的’是与希特勒所说的‘日耳曼民族是世界上最优秀的民族’如出一辙，是同样的错误。”在这些地方，张云川同章伯钧经常是一唱一和的。如在1956年7月7日农工党举行的中委座谈会上，章伯钧就说过：“认为‘共产党员是由特殊材料做成的’是混帐王八蛋的说法，我根本反对，我就曾经是共产党员，并未感到自己是特殊材料。”在同次座谈会上，章伯钧说“提出打倒中国共产党，是犯法，我不同意；但是，如有人主张不接受共产党的领导，要和共产党平分秋色，是可以的，因为这不算犯法，也不会影响他的职务和地位。”这些话，对于认为“如若不接受共产党的领导，似乎就应被打入十八层地狱的”张云川来说，真是“深得我心”。
    咬牙切齿看待积极分子
    “嫉共如仇”的张云川，对靠拢党的积极分子也是切齿痛恨的。去年7月6日的下午，他在农工党的中委座谈会上说：“事情坏就坏在一些所谓积极分子的身上，他们在共产党那里钻空子，惹是生非，我对这些人，从来不讲真心话，不客气的说，我对他们是采取一种‘敬鬼神而远之’的态度，共产党相信这些人，偏听偏信，并且在有形无形中还加以鼓励，这样作不仅没有帮助民主党派明辨是非，反而助长了民主党派的不团结。在共产党的眼光里，软骨头才算进步，骨头不软的人就有问题，解放以来就一贯如此就是有意地培养奴性。共产党这种作法，事实上就已经使得很多老实人变得很奴性，使很多聪明人变成了油子。”从这里也可以看出，今年他在中共中央统战部座谈会上骂靠拢党的积极分子是“审头刺汤”里的汤勤，是打墙挖沟的“义勇队”，不是偶然的。同时，他在5月31日致函人民日报声明他发言时所说的“所谓积极分子”是指“假积极分子”而言，也是彻头彻尾的说谎。这里我要引他自己的话为证。在农工党中委座谈会上，他将靠拢党的积极分子谩骂了一通以后用威胁的口吻说：“这种人民主同盟就有好几位，农工民主党也不少，究竟是哪些人，究竟谁跑统战部，不用我说大家也清楚。”这番话，明显地表示出他企图威胁积极分子不要靠拢党，企图使党在群众中孤立。从这里也说明了：他在人大小组会上说“我在统战部发言所说的积极分子虽然指的是假积极分子，但也影响到真积极分子靠近党”，是一种无耻的狡辩。
    一年以前就开始了恶毒的进攻
    右派分子只许别人谈共产党的缺点和错误而不许谈优点和成绩，也不是从今年帮助中共整风时才开始。去年6月底到7月初，张云川、王一帆、黄现璠、李健生等（均是右派分子）曾在农工党的座谈会上集中火力对共产党和党的统一战线工作进行攻击，季方表示不同意他们的看法，认为共产党和党的统一战线工作成绩是主要的，缺点和错误是次要的。这些右派分子立即对季方进行围攻。王一帆说：“连毛主席都说有缺点和错误，你能否认毛主席的话！”张云川说：“我最不喜欢谈‘成绩是主要的，缺点是次要的’这一套，这一套已经变成了口头禅，连杜勒斯都知道！老是对共产党歌功颂德一番，我就反对。”张云川在人大小组会上说“对新气象赞扬的少，是因为我自己有思想毛病，认为成绩人人知道”，也是谎话。
    企图为自己开脱罪责
    张云川在人大小组会上谈到农工党发展组织的问题时，态度也是极不老实的。他说章伯钧有“个人企图，我们大家不过被利用随声附和而已”。这是他在为自己开脱。长期共存、互相监督的方针提出后，章伯钧不止一次鼓吹取消“防区制”（他指的是各民主党派发展组织、开展工作的分工重点），主张大发展，上中下层都要。张云川在当时也是这样极力主张的。去年11月7日，农工党召开中央执行局会议讨论发展组织问题时，多数人反对取消所谓“防区制”，主张农工党仍然以医药卫生人员为工作的重点，但张云川反对，认为这样会限制发展，会“落后”于其他的民主党派。章伯钧对这个意见十分重视，在会议快结束时玩了这样一个两面手法：他在写给统战部的信里同意以医药卫生人员为重点，但在实际执行中要灵活掌握。这是去年11月的事。早在去年7月7日，张云川就在会上提出过这样的主张：发展组织上的清规戒律一定要打破，老是以黄河为界，墨守成规，就谈不到发挥“互相监督”的作用。西安、山东、河南、天津、保定这些地方又为什么不建立组织？我看都应该建立，干部不够，先挂个农工民主党的牌子也可以起宣传作用，扩大影响。
    今年5月，章伯钧、黄琪翔、李伯球等在北京点火，张云川匆匆忙忙地跑到河南去点火，借帮助中共整风的机会先去挂上一块农工民主党的牌子，招兵买马，网罗不满分子，向党进攻。难道说这都是被章伯钧“利用”？都只不过是“随声附和而已”吗？
    看看他相交的是些什么人
    张云川对共产党和社会主义这样的仇视，不是偶然的。他出身于恶霸地主家庭，他的父亲就是恶霸，被当地农民叫作“四霸天”（排行第四）。张云川在这个家庭里长大，一贯与农民为敌，直到解放后，他还站在地主阶级的立场讲话，一味强调土改中的缺点，对统购统销政策不满，等等。从1939年开始，他就常到被日本人占领的北京来活动，与汉奸组织——新民会的副会长喻熙杰、事务总长彭黎民等有来往，与何其巩（曾作过北京市市长，抗战胜利后曾一度担任蒋介石代表）有密切关系。在北京沦陷期间，他和张东荪建立了深厚的感情，这种感情一直维持到解放以后。张东荪曾经对人说：“我和云川是无话不谈的知交。”1945年，他托人送四万元伪币给张东荪，说是郝鹏举送的，说明他们和汉奸还有经济的来往。章伯钧曾企图在中国搞一个“三分天下”的局面，张云川对此也是“心向往之”。抗战胜利前不久，他就曾经对抗战胜利后的局势作过分析，他说，国共两党打起来如果我们反对，就会得到人民的“拥护”。又说，如果第三方面也拥有武装力量，在未来的局势中就可以发挥更大的作用。
    张云川是右派分子集团中一员反党反社会主义的“猛将”，他那副反党反社会主义的面目，是十分狰狞、十分凶恶的，我们必须与之作最坚决的斗争！
