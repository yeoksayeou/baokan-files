Zhang Yunchuan's Enemies and Friends
	Hu Yihe

At the end of 1953, the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party published an editorial in "Study and Work," emphasizing that democratic parties must loyally accept the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and severely criticizing some ideas of "ruling the country on an equal footing" and "sharing power equally." Zhang Yunchuan, then a member of the Central Executive Bureau of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, was very angry after reading the editorial. In a letter to a cadre of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, he said: "What misfortune to be a member of a democratic party! According to the viewpoint of this editorial, members of democratic parties must accept the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and if they do not accept the leadership of the Communist Party, it seems they should be thrown into the eighteenth level of hell." At the end of the letter, he asked the cadre to "pay attention" to the editorial and instructed with ulterior motives: This letter "should be destroyed after reading."
	This is the true face of Zhang Yunchuan, who repeatedly says he will not oppose the Party or socialism.

"I'd rather be hanged" than be led by Communists

In public, Zhang Yunchuan's methods were more subtle. On the one hand, he said he would accept the leadership of the Communist Party, and on the other hand, he completely denied the leadership of the Communist Party. In March of this year, the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party held a national working conference. Zhang Yunchuan said at a group meeting: We must accept the leadership of the Communist Party; however, accepting the leadership of the Party does not mean accepting the leadership of Communist Party members. There are more than ten million Communist Party members. It is already difficult enough for a daughter-in-law to be governed by one mother-in-law, and now she has to be governed by more than ten million mothers-in-law. I'd rather be hanged than do that! Zhang Yunchuan was agitated and furious when he said this.
	Zhang Yunchuan's intention in saying these words is also very clear. First, he compared Communist Party members to some "ferocious" mothers-in-law in the old society and non-Party members to tortured daughters-in-law, attempting to provoke the relationship between the masses and Communist Party members. Another more important point is to try to separate the Party's leadership and the Party members who embody the Party's leadership, and the Party's policies from the Party members who implement the policies, which actually denies the Party's leadership. At the same group meeting, he also spread such vicious reactionary remarks, saying: "Is it possible that every Communist Party member has a high level? To be honest, many Communist Party members are not as good as me, and I can lead many Communist Party members."
	Zhang Yunchuan, who calls himself "able to lead many Communist Party members," also has a special aversion to the saying that "Communist Party members are made of special materials." He said: "Thinking that 'Communist Party members are made of special materials' is the same mistake as Hitler's saying 'the Germanic nation is the most excellent nation in the world.'" In these places, Zhang Yunchuan and Zhang Bojun often echoed each other. For example, at a meeting of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party on July 7, 1956, Zhang Bojun said: "Thinking that 'Communist Party members are made of special materials' is a damn bastard's statement. I am fundamentally opposed to it. I used to be a Communist Party member, and I didn't feel that I was made of special materials." At the same meeting, Zhang Bojun said, "Proposing to overthrow the Chinese Communist Party is illegal, and I disagree; however, if someone advocates not accepting the leadership of the Communist Party and wanting to share power equally with the Communist Party, that is acceptable, because it is not illegal and will not affect his position and status." These words were truly "deeply in my heart" for Zhang Yunchuan, who believed that "if one does not accept the leadership of the Communist Party, it seems that he should be thrown into the eighteenth level of hell."

Looking at Activists with Gnashing Teeth

Zhang Yunchuan, who "hates the Communists like an enemy," also hates activists who are close to the Party with gnashing teeth. On the afternoon of July 6 last year, he said at a meeting of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party: "Things are bad because of some so-called activists. They take advantage of loopholes in the Communist Party, cause trouble, and I never tell these people the truth. To put it bluntly, I adopt an attitude of 'respecting ghosts and gods but keeping them at a distance' towards them. The Communist Party believes these people, listens to only one side, and encourages them in tangible and intangible ways. This not only does not help the democratic parties to distinguish right from wrong, but also encourages the disunity of the democratic parties. In the eyes of the Communist Party, spineless people are considered progressive, and people who are not spineless have problems. This has been the case since liberation, and it is intentional to cultivate servility. The Communist Party's practice has in fact made many honest people very servile and many smart people slippery." From this, it can also be seen that it was not accidental that he scolded the activists who were close to the Party at the symposium of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee this year as Tang Qin in "The Case of Judge Shi Tou" and the "dare-to-die corps" who dug ditches in the walls. At the same time, his letter to the People's Daily on May 31, stating that the "so-called activists" he mentioned in his speech referred to "fake activists," was also a thorough lie. Here, I would like to quote his own words as evidence. At a meeting of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, after scolding the activists who were close to the Party, he said in a threatening tone: "There are several such people in the People's Democratic League, and there are also many in the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. Who are they? Who runs to the United Front Work Department? I don't need to say it, everyone knows." These words clearly showed his attempt to threaten activists not to be close to the Party and to isolate the Party from the masses. This also shows that his statement at the group meeting of the National People's Congress that "the activists I mentioned in my speech at the United Front Work Department, although referring to fake activists, also affected the real activists approaching the Party" was a shameless sophistry.

Vicious attacks began a year ago

The rightists only allow others to talk about the shortcomings and mistakes of the Communist Party and do not allow them to talk about the advantages and achievements. This did not begin this year when they helped the CPC rectify its work. From the end of June to the beginning of July last year, Zhang Yunchuan, Wang Yifan, Huang Xianfan, Li Jiansheng, etc. (all of whom are rightists) focused their attacks on the Communist Party and the Party's united front work at a meeting of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. Ji Fang expressed his disagreement with their views, believing that the achievements of the Communist Party and the Party's united front work were the main aspect, and the shortcomings and mistakes were the secondary aspect. These rightists immediately surrounded and attacked Ji Fang. Wang Yifan said: "Even Chairman Mao said there are shortcomings and mistakes. Can you deny Chairman Mao's words!" Zhang Yunchuan said: "I don't like talking about 'achievements are the main aspect, and shortcomings are the secondary aspect.' This has become a clich√©. Even Dulles knows it! I object to always singing praises to the Communist Party." Zhang Yunchuan's statement at the group meeting of the National People's Congress that "I praise the new atmosphere less because I have ideological problems and think everyone knows the achievements" is also a lie.

Attempting to Exculpate Himself

Zhang Yunchuan's attitude when talking about the issue of developing the organization of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party at the group meeting of the National People's Congress was also extremely dishonest. He said that Zhang Bojun had "personal intentions, and we were just being used to echo him." This is him trying to exculpate himself. After the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision was put forward, Zhang Bojun more than once advocated abolishing the "defense zone system" (he was referring to the division of labor and focus of various democratic parties in developing organizations and carrying out work), advocating large-scale development at all levels, upper, middle, and lower. Zhang Yunchuan was also extremely supportive of this at the time. On November 7 last year, when the Central Executive Bureau of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party held a meeting to discuss the issue of developing the organization, most people opposed abolishing the so-called "defense zone system," advocating that the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party should still focus on medical and health personnel, but Zhang Yunchuan opposed it, believing that this would limit development and "lag behind" other democratic parties. Zhang Bojun attached great importance to this opinion and played such a two-faced trick when the meeting was about to end: in a letter to the United Front Work Department, he agreed to focus on medical and health personnel, but in actual implementation, it should be flexibly grasped. This was in November last year. As early as July 7 last year, Zhang Yunchuan had proposed at the meeting: the rigid rules and regulations on developing the organization must be broken. Always using the Yellow River as a boundary and sticking to conventions will not lead to giving play to the role of "mutual supervision." Why not establish organizations in Xi'an, Shandong, Henan, Tianjin, and Baoding? I think they should all be established. If there are not enough cadres, first hanging up a sign of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party can also play a propaganda role and expand influence.
	In May of this year, Zhang Bojun, Huang Qixiang, Li Boqiu, etc. started fires in Beijing, and Zhang Yunchuan hurriedly ran to Henan to start fires, taking the opportunity of helping the CPC rectify its work to first hang up a sign of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, recruit troops and buy horses, and gather dissatisfied elements to attack the Party. Can it be said that this was all being "used" by Zhang Bojun? Was it just "echoing him"?

Look at the kind of people he associates with

Zhang Yunchuan's hatred of the Communist Party and socialism is not accidental. He was born into a family of tyrannical landlords. His father was a tyrant and was called "Fourth Tyrant" by the local peasants. Zhang Yunchuan grew up in this family and has always been an enemy of the peasants. Even after liberation, he still spoke from the standpoint of the landlord class, always emphasizing the shortcomings of the land reform, and was dissatisfied with the policy of unified purchase and sale, etc. From 1939, he often came to Beijing, which was occupied by the Japanese, and had contacts with the vice chairman of the traitor organization‚Äîthe New People's Association, Yu Xijie, and the chief of general affairs, Peng Limin, etc., and had close relations with He Qigong (who had served as the mayor of Beijing and once served as Chiang Kai-shek's representative after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan). During the fall of Beijing, he established a deep relationship with Zhang Dongsun, which lasted until after liberation. Zhang Dongsun once said to others: "Yunchuan and I are close friends who talk about everything." In 1945, he asked someone to send 40,000 yuan of puppet currency to Zhang Dongsun, saying that it was sent by Hao Pengju, indicating that they also had economic contacts with traitors. Zhang Bojun once attempted to create a situation of "three divisions of the world" in China, and Zhang Yunchuan also "yearned for it." Not long before the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he had analyzed the situation after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, saying that if we opposed the Kuomintang and the Communist Party fighting, we would get the "support" of the people. He also said that if the third party also had armed forces, it could play a greater role in the future situation.
	Zhang Yunchuan is a member of the rightist group, a "fierce general" against the Party and socialism. His anti-Party and anti-socialist face is very hideous and very ferocious. We must wage the most resolute struggle against him!
