Xinhua News Agency, 12th. The spokesperson for the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China, today made the following statement to a reporter from China News Service regarding the issue of overseas Chinese investing and establishing schools in the country: The spokesperson said that overseas Chinese have a long history of investing in Southeast Asian countries. Overseas Chinese have contributed to the development of Southeast Asia and the prosperity of the local economy. In areas with large overseas Chinese populations, the overseas Chinese economy has become a part of the local national economy. However, due to the imperialists' control of the economic lifeline of Southeast Asia, large-scale economic aggression, and restrictions on the development of local national industries, overseas Chinese investment has been more in commerce, especially in retail. After independence, Southeast Asian countries have been developing their national economies. Some countries are studying the development direction of the overseas Chinese economy, and some countries have decided to encourage overseas Chinese surplus funds to invest in local industrial construction. We believe that overseas Chinese floating capital or part of the commercial capital, with the approval of the local government, gradually transferred to industry to participate in the local national industrial construction, which not only meets the long-term interests of overseas Chinese, but also helps Southeast Asian countries develop industry and prosper the economy, and is in line with the Asian-African Conference’s general desire for economic cooperation.

The spokesperson said: Overseas Chinese have always been concerned about and supported the construction of the motherland. In the late Qing Dynasty and the Chiang Kai-shek era, overseas Chinese built two railways in their hometowns (Xiamen to Zhangzhou, Shantou to Chaozhou) and ran some factories, but they all failed. The railways were torn down, and the factories lost money. On the eve of liberation, there were very few enterprises invested by overseas Chinese in China. After the national liberation, overseas Chinese loved the motherland and supported and participated in the socialist construction of the motherland. In 1956, the shares absorbed by the overseas Chinese investment companies in Guangdong and Fujian provinces accounted for one-tenth of the local industrial investment in the two provinces; by the end of 1956, the factories and enterprises established by the overseas Chinese investment companies in the two provinces had reached 44. Since the founding of the country, the number of overseas Chinese returning to invest has increased year by year. Taking 1952 as 100, the capital absorbed by overseas Chinese investment companies in Guangdong and Fujian provinces was 305% in 1955, and 487% in 1956 after adding the capital absorbed by Shanghai Overseas Chinese Investment Company. The state's policy on overseas Chinese returning to invest is based on the needs of the national economic plan, taking into account the wishes of overseas Chinese investors, mainly through investment companies, but also allowing joint ventures or public-private partnerships, and also allowing sole proprietorship, so that overseas Chinese can choose the method that suits their wishes. Now, the State Council has also announced the "Preferential Measures for Overseas Chinese Investing in State-owned Overseas Chinese Investment Companies" on August 2, which will undoubtedly be warmly supported by the vast number of overseas Chinese.

The spokesperson said: We encourage overseas Chinese floating capital or commercial capital to gradually transfer to industrial construction with the approval of the government of the country where they reside, because this is in the interests of overseas Chinese and the people of the country where they reside; however, some overseas Chinese encounter difficulties in operation locally, or lack technology, or have family members in China who need to be supported, and are willing to remit part of their funds back to China to invest in the construction of the motherland. We also welcome such overseas Chinese investment and provide guidance.

Regarding the issue of overseas Chinese donating funds to establish schools, the spokesperson said: Donating funds to establish schools is a fine tradition of overseas Chinese. There are many overseas Chinese children abroad, and it is difficult to return to China for further education. The state actively encourages overseas Chinese to raise funds to establish schools in their countries of residence to solve the education problems of their children locally, and hopes that overseas Chinese will establish more primary and secondary schools and overseas Chinese spare-time education. Where conditions permit, universities can also be established. In these schools, not only should they learn Chinese language, history and geography, but also local language, history and geography, so that overseas Chinese children can better serve the overseas Chinese community and the people of their country of residence. This is in line with the sincere desire of the Asian-African Conference for cultural cooperation.

The spokesperson pointed out: Overseas Chinese have not only established many schools abroad to educate their children, but also donated funds to establish many schools in China, including the famous Xiamen University and Jimei School founded by Mr. Chen Jiageng, and Guoguang Middle School established by other overseas Chinese leaders. Among the dozens of middle schools in Meixian, Guangdong, most of them were established by overseas Chinese. There were originally 44 overseas Chinese-run middle schools in Fujian Province, with more than 37,000 students, accounting for about 23% of the total number of middle school students in the province, which is more than five times that before liberation. Now, the number of overseas Chinese-run middle schools in the province has increased from 44 to 67. The number of overseas Chinese-run primary schools is even greater. Overseas Chinese actively donating funds to build schools not only helps solve the education problems of overseas Chinese children, but also contributes to the development of cultural construction in their hometowns. The "Measures for Overseas Chinese Donating Funds to Establish Schools" promulgated by the State Council on August 2 will surely greatly encourage the enthusiasm of overseas Chinese to donate funds to establish schools.

    侨务委员会负责人发表谈话
    欢迎侨胞投资和办学
    新华社12日讯　中华人民共和国华侨事务委员会发言人，今天就华侨在国内投资和兴办学校问题，向中国新闻社记者发表谈话如下：发言人说，华侨在东南亚各国投资有悠久的历史。华侨对开发东南亚和繁荣当地经济是有贡献的。在华侨众多的地方，华侨经济已成为当地国民经济的一部分。但是，由于帝国主义控制了东南亚的经济命脉，进行大规模的经济侵略，限制发展当地的民族工业，因而华侨投资在商业方面的多一些，特别在零售商方面。东南亚各国在独立以后，都要发展本民族经济，有的国家正在研究华侨经济的发展方向，有的国家决定鼓励华侨剩余资金投入当地工业建设。我们认为，华侨游资或者一部分商业资金，在当地政府赞同下，逐步转入工业，参加当地的民族工业建设，这不仅符合华侨的长远利益，而且也有助于东南亚各国发展工业和繁荣经济，并且符合于亚非会议关于实行经济合作的普遍愿望。
    发言人说：华侨一向关怀和支持祖国的建设事业。在晚清和蒋介石统治时代，华侨曾在侨乡修筑了两条铁路（厦门到漳州，汕头到潮州），办了一些工厂，但是都失败了，铁路被扒走了，工厂赔了本。解放前夕，华侨在国内投资的企业，所剩已寥寥无几。全国解放后，华侨热爱祖国，支持和参加祖国的社会主义建设事业。1956年，广东、福建两省的华侨投资公司吸收的股金，各占两省地方工业投资的十分之一；到1956年底，两省华侨投资公司创建的工厂和企业已达四十四个。建国以来，华侨回国投资的数字逐年增加，广东、福建两省的华侨投资公司吸收资金如以1952年为一百；到1955年就为305％，1956年加上上海华侨投资公司吸收的资金后就为487％。国家对华侨回国投资的政策，是根据国家经济计划的需要，照顾华侨投资人的愿望，以投资公司为主，也允许合资经营或公私合营，并且允许独资经营，以便华侨选择适合他们意愿的方式。现在国务院又在8月2日公布了“华侨投资于国营华侨投资公司的优待办法”，无疑这将获得广大华侨的热烈拥护。
    发言人说：我们鼓励华侨游资或者商业资本，在所在国政府赞同下，逐步地转入工业建设，因为这是符合华侨和侨居国人民利益的；但是，有些华侨在当地遭遇经营方面的困难，或者缺乏技术，或者有家属在国内需要赡养等等原因而愿意把一部分资金寄回国内，投资于祖国建设事业，对于这种华侨投资，我们也是欢迎的，并且予以辅导。
    关于华侨捐资兴办学校的问题，发言人说：捐资兴办学校，是华侨的优良传统。华侨子弟在国外的数量很多，回国升学有困难。国家积极鼓励华侨在侨居国集资办学，就地解决子女教育问题，希望华侨多办中、小学和华侨业余教育，在有条件的地方也可以办大学。在这些学校里，不仅要学习中国语文、史地，并且要学习当地语文、史地，这样可以使华侨子弟更好地为华侨群众服务，为侨居国人民服务，这样做是符合亚非会议对于文化合作的真挚愿望的。
    发言人指出：华侨不仅在国外办了许多学校教育子女，而且在国内捐资办了许多学校，其中著名的如陈嘉庚先生所创办的厦门大学、集美学校，其他侨领兴办的国光中学等等。广东梅县数十所中学中，华侨兴办的占多数。福建省原有四十四所侨办中学，在校学生有三万七千多人，约占全省中学生人数23％，比解放前增加了五倍多，现在全省侨办中学已由四十四所增加到六十七所。至于侨办小学的数量更多。华侨积极捐资兴学，不仅对解决华侨子弟教育问题有帮助，而且对发展侨乡文化建设事业也有贡献。国务院8月2日公布的“华侨捐资兴办学校办法”，必将大大鼓舞华侨捐资办学的热情。
