Two capable lieutenants of Chu Anping at Guangming Daily:

　　Pan Wenbin  Promotes "Cultural Revolution" and Frenziedly Attacks the Party

　　Pan Wenbin, Director of the School Education Department of Guangming Daily, vigorously promoted the so-called "Cultural Revolution" between April and June this year, instigated intellectuals to attack the Party, supported Chu Anping in tampering with the political direction of Guangming Daily, and stirred up trouble everywhere in universities. Pan Wenbin's disguised progressive face has now been clearly exposed.

　　Releasing a Signal Flare

　　A few days after the CCP Central Committee issued instructions on rectification, Guangming Daily, under the pretext of commemorating the "May Fourth" Movement, used an editorial (titled: Boldly Implement the Policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend") to launch a signal flare attacking the Party. This signal flare was personally manufactured by Pan Wenbin.

　　In this editorial, Pan Wenbin equated the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" with the May Fourth Movement, which had the task of opposing imperialism and feudalism, calling it a "cultural revolutionary movement more magnificent and larger in scale than the May Fourth Movement after the May Fourth Movement." He called on the national intellectual circles to "muster a spirit even more fearless than the May Fourth Movement's opposition to comprador culture and feudal culture," and "muster strength to welcome the spring." More maliciously, the editorial repeatedly mentioned Chairman Mao's speeches at the Supreme State Conference and the CCP Central Committee's propaganda work conference, as if this article was based on the spirit of the central government's guidelines and policies, which greatly confused many people and had an extremely serious instigating effect. While launching this Pan-marked signal flare, Chu Anping successively sent a large number of reporters to nine major cities to start fires.

　　Before manufacturing this signal flare, Pan Wenbin, using the pen name "Wen Bing," published three articles, "Feeling of Spring," "My Talk on 'Commentaries on the Six Classics'," and "Political Treatment and Study Life," spreading seeds of discord and foreshadowing the May Fourth editorial, plotting to launch a so-called "Cultural Revolution."

　　But whose "life" did Pan Wenbin want to "revolutionize"? What kind of "revolution" did he want to launch? He attacked Marxism-Leninism under the guise of opposing dogmatism. Pan Wenbin's two "negation" theories put forward in a criticism meeting are ironclad proof of his anti-Party thinking.

　　According to him, at the beginning of liberation, the Chinese Communist Party used dogmatism to negate everything in old China, which was the first negation; and now, the proposal to oppose dogmatism is the negation of the negation. What is the intention? It is self-evident.

　　Actively Starting Fires and Showing Off His Skills

　　Pan Wenbin's work in recent years has not been very active, but during the period of great blooming and contending, he was full of energy, working through the night. He finished writing the May Fourth editorial at 4:00 AM on April 27th and set off for Wuhan at 7:00 AM to start fires for Chu Anping.

　　As soon as he arrived in Wuhan, he sent back a telegram saying that "the blooming and contending of Wuhan's intellectual circles is overcast but not raining," encouraging the masses to attack the Party in order to disrupt the local rectification steps. During his ten days in Wuhan, he held three symposiums. At the symposiums, he incited everyone to "speak freely." When organizing the records of the symposiums, he specifically collected the most vicious speeches and highlighted and embellished them from the introduction to the headlines, both large and small. At the same time, he wrote two communications in Wuhan, neither of which had a real name throughout. Pan Wenbin, through the mouths of "a gentleman" and "a professor," cursed the Communist Party and the new society to the fullest extent.

　　When he returned from Wuhan, he paid special "attention" to Renmin University of China and immediately arranged for one of his female generals—Xu Ying—to put aside other work and go to Renmin University to "seize dogmatism." Under their joint cooperation, they finally fabricated a report saying that "Renmin University of China is like a dogmatic beehive," negating all the achievements of Renmin University over the past few years.

　　Also not long after returning from Wuhan, Pan Wenbin arranged for reporters to quickly produce a report saying that Tsinghua University's blooming and contending was not enough. At this time, the People's Daily had reported the news that Tsinghua teachers were talking freely. After Pan Wenbin personally went to Tsinghua to pry into the situation, he said to Xu Ying, "We will sing a duet with the People's Daily," and he personally marked the manuscript with the inflammatory title "Has Not Yet Achieved Talking Freely."

　　In the twenty-odd days after Pan Wenbin returned to Beijing, he mobilized the editors and reporters of the School Education Department to try every means to seize the opportunity to start fires. According to a reporter's exposure, Pan Wenbin alone assigned him three consecutive fire-starting tasks. The anti-Rightist struggle began, but Pan Wenbin's fire-starting activities did not stop.

　　The report "Peking University Opens 'Democracy Wall'," which incited college students to make trouble, was another "masterpiece" of Pan Wenbin. After this report was published, it played an instigating role in universities in many places.

　　Two Spearheads Attacking the Party

　　When the right-wing elements clamored to abolish the system of Party committee responsibility in universities and proposed the so-called "democratic school management," Pan Wenbin took the opportunity to throw out a sensational and untrue report of "Fudan University Abolishes the System of Party Committee Responsibility," attempting to add fuel to the fire. When he heard a reporter mention this unverified news in a casual conversation, he thought it was a big news and asked the reporter to write it quickly. The day after it was published, the People's Daily published the correct news that Fudan University had not abolished the system of Party committee responsibility, but Pan Wenbin, carrying out Chu Anping's intentions, wrote a report that seemed to be a correction but was not, and was essentially confronting the People's Daily.

　　Pan Wenbin's release of this poisoned arrow revealed his consistent dissatisfaction with the Party's leadership over higher education. According to the exposed materials, Pan Wenbin believed that the Ministry of Higher Education did not understand its business at all, and the things that should be negated were more than the things that should be affirmed. He encouraged reporters to boldly reflect the opinions of teachers in Shanghai universities and not to be afraid of being too sharp when reporting. He also did not relax his attack on political classes, using a piece of news to make a sensational headline of "Searching for the Roots of Dogmatism in Political Classes," placing it on the front page as the top story.

　　The second spearhead of Pan Wenbin's attack on the Party was to completely distort the new face of senior intellectuals after ideological remolding, and to provoke the relationship between the Party and intellectuals. In several articles he wrote about intellectuals, he considered himself to have "deeply understood the character and psychology of intellectuals." In the eyes of the right-wing element Pan Wenbin, "the 'political treatment' of the past few years has pulled intellectuals out of their studies; it has made people ambitious, and even if they have time to sit in their studies, they cannot sit still, their eyes are not looking at books, but are wholeheartedly thinking that a swan goose is about to arrive." This is how he vilified the political consciousness of intellectuals who actively participated in social activities after ideological remolding. He said: "Everyone already has the habit of having the leadership take the lead in making arrangements. If the masses are not enthusiastic but the leaders are enthusiastic, after a mobilization report, everyone has to be enthusiastic, sit down and talk about their experiences. If the masses are enthusiastic but the leaders are not enthusiastic, then they can only be enthusiastic in their hearts, and there is no way to do anything about it." This is how he provoked and distorted the relationship between the Party leadership and the masses. He said: "In the past, intellectuals were 'though separated by land or sea, we are neighbours nonetheless'," "they could talk about their inner thoughts without any worries, as they pleased"; "but in the past few years, the item of 'friendship' has been erased from the lives of intellectuals." This is how he views the new society, and he loudly sings the anti-tune that the Communist Party "does not recognize relatives." He depicted the new face of the intellectual circles, which was booming and moving forward after liberation, as so gloomy and terrible.

　　Now, Pan Wenbin's crimes are being exposed one by one. And he himself, while being labeled, still believes that this is a problem of ideology that cannot be solved all at once, and adopts an attitude of passive resistance. We want to solemnly warn Pan Wenbin: Your fire-starting activities, dominated by your deeply ingrained anti-communist ideology, are obviously sinful. Do not continue to persist in evil and cut yourself off from the people.

### 潘文彬　鼓吹“文化革命”　疯狂向党进攻

　　储安平在光明日报的两员干将
　　潘文彬  鼓吹“文化革命”　疯狂向党进攻
    光明日报学校教育部主任潘文彬，在今年4到6月间，大肆鼓吹什么“文化革命”，挑拨知识分子向党进攻，支持储安平篡改光明日报的政治方向，在高等学校到处点火。潘文彬伪装进步的面目，现在已经清清楚楚的暴露出来了。
      放出一颗信号弹
    中共中央发表整风指示以后几天，光明日报假借纪念“五四”为名，利用社论（题名：大胆贯彻“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针）射出了一颗向党进攻的信号弹。这颗信号弹就是潘文彬亲手制造的。
    潘文彬在这篇社论中，把“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的政策同以反帝反封建为任务的五四运动相提并论，称之为“五四而后，较之五四运动波澜更为壮阔、规模更为宏伟的文化革命运动”，他号召全国知识界“拿出比五四反对帝国主义的买办文化和封建主义文化更加大无畏的精神”，“鼓起力量，迎接春天”。更恶毒的是，社论中一再提及毛主席在最高国务会议和中共中央宣传工作会议上的讲话，好像这篇文章是根据中央的方针政策的精神而加以阐发的，这大大地迷惑了不少人，起了极为严重的煽动作用。储安平在射出这颗潘记信号弹的同时，就先后派出大批记者，到九大城市去放火。
    潘文彬在制造这颗信号弹之前，他用“文冰”这个笔名，发表了“春天的感应”，“关于‘六经注’我的谈话”，“政治待遇与书斋生活”三篇文章，散布火种，预为五四社论安下伏笔，阴谋掀起一次所谓“文化革命”。
    可是，潘文彬要“革”谁的“命”呢？要掀起一场什么样的“革命”呢？他是假借反对教条主义之名，来攻击马克思列宁主义。潘文彬在一次批判会上的检讨中所提出的两个“否定”论，就是他的这种反党思想的铁证。
    根据他的说法，解放之初，中国共产党是用教条主义否定了旧中国的一切，这是第一个否定；而现在提出反对教条主义是否定之否定。用意何在？不言自明。
      积极点火大显身手
    潘文彬在近几年的工作是并不怎么积极的，可是在大鸣大放期间，则干劲十足，通宵达旦。他在4月27日清晨四时写完五四社论，七时就动身到武汉去替储安平放火。
    他一到武汉就拍来一条“武汉知识界的鸣放密云不雨”的电讯，鼓动群众向党进攻，以便打乱当地整风步骤。在武汉十天之中他就召开了三个座谈会。他在座谈会上，煽动大家“畅所欲言”。在整理座谈会记录时，专门汇集了最刻毒的发言，并从导语到大小标题加以突出和渲染。同时，他在武汉又写了两篇全篇都没有一个真实姓名的通讯，潘文彬借用“一位先生”、“一位教授”之口，骂尽了共产党和新社会。
    当他一从武汉回来，就特别“关心”中国人民大学，立即布置他手下的一名女将——徐颖放下别的工作，到人大去“抓教条主义”。在他们一起合作之下，终于制造了“中国人民大学像一个教条主义大蜂窝”的报道，否定了人民大学几年来的全部成就。
    也是从武汉回来不久，潘文彬又布置记者赶快搞出一条清华大学鸣放不够的报道。这时，人民日报曾经报道了清华教师开怀畅谈的消息。而潘文彬亲到清华去窥测以后，对徐颖说，“我们就和人民日报唱对台戏”，他亲自在稿子上标上“尚未做到开怀畅谈”的煽惑性的标题。
    潘文彬在回到北京的二十多天中，动员学校教育部的编辑、记者，千方百计，抓紧点火机会。根据一个记者的揭发，潘文彬单是对他一个人就连续布置了三次点火任务。反右派的斗争开始，潘文彬的点火活动还不肯停止。
    煽动大学生闹事的“北大开辟‘民主墙’”报道，更是潘文彬的一项“杰作”。这个报道发表以后，在不少地方的大学里起了煽动作用。
    向党进攻的两个矛头
    当右派分子喧嚷要取消高等学校党委负责制，提出所谓“民主办校”的时候，潘文彬乘机抛出了“复旦大学取消党委负责制”的耸动听闻的失实报道，企图火上加油。他听见一位记者在闲谈中说到这个还没经过核实的消息时，便认为是一条大新闻，要这个记者赶快写出来。刊出后的第二天，人民日报发表了复旦大学没有取消党委负责制的正确新闻，而潘文彬执行储安平的意图，竟写出了一条似更正非更正、实质上是和人民日报对抗的报道。
    潘文彬放出这支暗箭，正是露出了他一贯对党领导高等教育的不满。根据揭发的材料，潘文彬认为高教部根本不懂业务，应该否定的东西要比肯定的东西多。他鼓动记者要大胆反映上海高等学校教师的意见，报道时不怕太尖。他对政治课也没有放松进攻，利用一条新闻，做了“搜索政治课中教条主义产生的根源”的骇人听闻的标题，放在第一版做头条。
    潘文彬向党进攻的第二个矛头，是全盘歪曲高级知识分子经过思想改造以后的新面貌，挑拨党与知识分子的关系。在他写的有关知识分子的几篇文章里，他自认为是“深味知识分子之性格与心理”的。在右派分子潘文彬的眼睛里，“几年来的‘政治待遇’把知识分子拉出了书斋；使人野了心，即使有时间坐在书斋里也坐不住，两眼不是看着书本，而是一心以为有鸿鹄将至”。他是这样丑化知识分子经过思想改造积极参加社会活动的政治觉悟。他说：“大家已经有了凡事由领导带头布置的习惯。群众不热而领导热的事，一次动员报告，大家也只好热起来，坐下来漫谈体会一番。群众热而领导不热，那就只有放在心里热而已，毫无办法”。他是这样来挑拨、歪曲党领导与群众的关系。他说：“在从前，知识分子是‘海内存知己，天涯若比邻’”，“可以无所顾虑，随心所欲地谈谈心里的话”；“可是这几年来，‘友道’这一项已从知识分子的生活中抹去了”。他是这样来看待新社会，他大唱共产党“六亲不认”的反调。把解放后蓬蓬勃勃、迈步前进的知识界的新面貌，描绘得如此阴惨可怕。
    现在，潘文彬的罪行正被一一揭发出来。而他自己则一面扣上了帽子，一面仍然认为这是思想问题不能一下子解决，采取消极抗拒的态度。我们要正告潘文彬：在你根深蒂固的反共思想支配下的点火活动，罪恶昭彰，不要再怙恶不改，自绝于人民。
