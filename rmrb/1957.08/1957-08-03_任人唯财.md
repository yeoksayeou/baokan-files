This is a small room filled with smoke. At one end of the room is a long table, seated with a row of congressmen puffing on cigars or smoking pipes. The place is packed with people. News reporters with notebooks and pencils are waiting nervously. Press photographers hold various flash cameras, movie cameras, and television cameras, all lenses pointed directly at Mr. Maxwell Gluck, the newly appointed U.S. Ambassador to Ceylon by President Eisenhower, a thin man around fifty-seven or eight years old with sparse hair and a small mustache, seated opposite the congressmen.

Mr. Gluck has come here today and become the center of attention for a reason. He originally ran a horse-breeding business in Kentucky and was also the owner of 140 women's clothing stores stretching from the east coast to the west coast of the United States. Last year, he suddenly developed a strong desire for government work and wanted to "play a role." So he donated tens of thousands of dollars to the Republican Party, which was in a heated election campaign at the time, and incidentally expressed his "hope." Sure enough, his money was well spent, and Mr. Gluck's wish was quickly fulfilled. Although his talents in horse-breeding and selling women's shirts are hard to connect with the duties of an ambassador to Ceylon, what does that matter? – he thought – I have plenty of money and business acumen. So, when he received a notice from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee asking him to attend a hearing regarding his appointment on July 25, he was indeed overjoyed.

On that day, after putting in some effort to groom himself, Mr. Gluck went to the place where the committee hearing was to be held, feeling satisfied. But being under so much scrutiny inevitably made him feel "as nervous as a cat." This was not surprising, because the signs were indeed somewhat unfavorable. The hearing began.

"Do you know the name of the current Prime Minister of the Ceylon government?"

"..." No answer.

"Do you know the name of the current Prime Minister of the Indian government, Ceylon's neighbor?"

"..." Again, no answer.

After a tense silence, the conference room erupted in laughter. News reporters became frantic. Mr. Gluck thus became a news figure. Mr. Gluck repeatedly expressed "deep regret" that someone had made a big deal out of his failure to answer questions during the hearing. Because, in his own view, he is a person with unique talents. Just six days after the hearing, on July 31, he boasted to reporters that he had learned about Ceylon in less than four weeks what others had taken years to learn. He proudly pointed out that he could now correctly pronounce the name of Ceylon's Prime Minister, Bandaranaike. However, this "genius diplomat" could not help but add with a frown: "Even now, it is not easy to remember the first name of the Indian Prime Minister."

After this newly appointed U.S. Ambassador to Ceylon became a news figure before even setting off, someone asked Eisenhower if it was because Gluck had donated that money to the Republican Party that he was given the position of Ambassador to Ceylon. According to the Associated Press, the President "blushed" at the time, and he admitted that he had appointed him based on the recommendations of "friends" and considering Gluck's business experience. Why the President blushed is unknown. Recently, Washington has been appointing more and more big capitalists to ambassadorial positions. Gluck is not a unique case. They donate a lot of money to the Republican Party, and what's wrong with being an ambassador for a few years?

    任人唯财
    施旅
    这是一间烟雾弥漫的不大的屋子。屋子的那一头摆着一张长桌子，坐着一排喷着雪茄或者叼着烟斗的议员先生。到处都塞满了人。新闻记者们拿着记事本和铅笔，紧张地等待着。摄影记者举着各式镁光摄影机、电影摄影机、电视摄影机，镜头都是正对着坐在议员先生们对面的一位年约五十七、八，有着稀疏的头发，留着一撮小胡子的细长个子——新近被艾森豪威尔总统任命为美国驻锡兰大使的马克斯韦耳·格拉克先生。
    格拉克先生今天来到这里，并且成为众所注目的人物，是有一番缘由的。他原是在肯塔基州经营养马业的，同时是从美国东海岸到西海岸一路开设的一百四十家妇女服装商店的老板。去年他忽然官瘾大发，要在政府工作上“发挥一些作用”。于是他就捐了几万美元给当时正在紧张竞选中的共和党，顺便表示了一下他的“希望”。果然钱没有白花，格拉克先生很快就如愿以偿了。虽然养马和卖女用衬衣的才干很难同驻锡兰大使的事务联系得上，但是这有什么关系呢？——他想——我有的是钱和生意经。所以，当他接到参议院外交委员会的通知，要他在7月25日出席有关他的任命的作证会时，他确实是兴高采烈的。
    到了那一天，在下功夫修饰了一番之后，格拉克先生怀着满意的心情到委员会举行作证会的地方去了。但是众目睽睽，不免使他感到“像一头猫一样地神经紧张”起来。这倒也不足为奇，因为苗头的确有些不对哩。作证开始了。
    “你知道锡兰政府现任总理的名字吗？”
    “……”没有回答。
    “你知道锡兰的近邻印度政府现任总理的名字吗？”
    “……”又没有回答。
    在一阵紧张的沉默之后，会议室中爆发了哄堂大笑。新闻记者都忙乱起来。格拉克先生就这样成了新闻人物。格拉克先生对于有人竟大事宣扬他在作证时答不上问话一事，一再表示“我很遗憾”。因为，在他自己看来，他是具有独特才干的人。就在作证的六天以后，7月31日，他对新闻记者吹嘘说，关于锡兰的情况，他在不到四个礼拜的过程中，就学到了别人花了成年的时间所学习的东西。他自豪地举出，他现在已经能够正确地念出锡兰总理班达拉奈克的名字了。不过这位“天才外交家”却不免要绉着眉头补充一句：“即使在现在要想起印度总理的教名也还不容易。”
    在这位美国新任驻锡兰大使未及上路就成了新闻人物之后，有人问艾森豪威尔，是不是因为格拉克给共和党捐了那笔钱，给他当驻锡兰大使的。据美联社报道说，总统当时“脸红起来”，他承认他是根据“朋友们”的推荐并且考虑了格拉克的商业经历而任用他的。总统为什么脸红不得而知。近来华盛顿任命愈来愈多的大资本家担任大使的职位。格拉克并不是独一无二的新官。他们捐了许多钱给共和党，当个几年大使，又有何不可呢？
