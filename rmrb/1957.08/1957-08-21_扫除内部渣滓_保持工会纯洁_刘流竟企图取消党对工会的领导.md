Sweep Away Internal Dross and Maintain the Purity of the Trade Union
　　Liu Liu Attempts to Abolish Party Leadership Over the Trade Union

    (Our dispatch) The entire staff of the Fushun City Federation of Trade Unions has been holding meetings for days to counter the anti-Communist and anti-socialist fallacies of Liu Liu, deputy director of the Workers' Club and a rightist element.

    Liu Liu viciously stirred up discord between the Party and the trade union, attempting to abolish Party leadership over the trade union. He clamored: "The era of the Party monopolizing the trade union should end; the trade union should be privately run! If the chairman of the trade union is a Party member, then the vice-chairman should be a non-Party member." He believed that "if one leader of the trade union is a Party member and the other is a non-Party member, the non-Party member will definitely do a better job."

    Liu Liu usually boasted everywhere that he had joined the revolution at the age of eighteen, that he was an old cadre who had followed the Communist Party for more than twenty years, and that he was a "rare musician in the world," in order to deceive and hoodwink the masses. But in his bones, he was consistently dissatisfied with the Party and was an ambitious person who was anti-Party and anti-socialist. When the Party's rectification began, he thought the time had come and immediately spread poison everywhere to launch a frenzied attack on the Party. He slandered the Communist Party as having "become a socialist party," even "less progressive than a third party," saying that "Party organizations in recent years have not sought thorough understanding of theory and do not have the style of in-depth theory from the Yan'an period," and also said that the Party Central Committee had "deep-rooted ideological problems," and that "the source of subjectivism and sectarianism is also the Central Committee." He railed against the Communist Party as "autocratic" and "dark," slandered Party members and leading cadres as having "lost their Party spirit," "no longer having the scent of Communist Party members," and all being people who "eat by politics" and "bully" people. He vigorously praised Chu Anping's reactionary theory of "the Party's world." When Luo Longji proposed to establish a "rehabilitation committee," he shouted and yelled, "The suppression of counter-revolutionaries went wrong," and also said that Hu Feng was not a counter-revolutionary.

    When the national struggle against the rightists unfolded, he hated it to the bone, saying: "Some rightists' remarks are not necessarily anti-Party remarks; don't be too neurotic, don't be immoral, and don't retaliate." He raved that "the People's Daily is too left," and slandered the reports published in the Party newspaper denouncing rightists as "clichés" and "criticism of criticism is the thought of the Party's world."

    扫除内部渣滓　保持工会纯洁
　　刘流竟企图取消党对工会的领导
    本报讯　抚顺市工会联合会全体职工连日集会，反击职工俱乐部副主任、右派分子刘流的反共反社会主义谬论。
    刘流恶毒地挑拨党和工会的关系，妄图取消党对工会的领导。他叫嚣：“党包办工会的时代应该结束了，工会应该是民办！工会主席是党员，副主席就应该是非党员。”他认为“工会一个由党员领导，一个由非党员领导，肯定是非党员干的好。”
    刘流平日到处吹嘘自己从十八岁就参加了革命，是跟着共产党走了二十多年的老干部，是“世界上少有的音乐家”，以此蒙混、欺骗群众。但在骨子里，他却是一贯对党不满，反党反社会主义的野心家。党整风开始，他认为时机已到，即到处放毒向党猖狂进攻。他污蔑共产党“变成社会党了”，甚至“连第三党的进步性都不如”，说“党组织近几年对理论不求甚解，没有在延安时深入理论的作风”，还说党中央有“根深蒂固的思想问题”，“主观主义、宗派主义的发源地也是中央”。他谩骂共产党“专制”、“黑暗”、污蔑党员和领导干部“都没有了党性”，“没有了共产党员的气味”，都是“靠政治吃饭”，“欺侮人”的人。他大力赞扬储安平“党天下”的反动论调。罗隆基提出要成立“平反委员会”，他就大喊大叫“肃反搞错了”，还说胡风不是反革命。
    全国反击右派的斗争展开时，他恨之入骨，说：“有些右派分子的言论，不一定是反党言论，不要太神经衰弱，不要缺德，打击报复。”他狂叫“人民日报太左了”，对党报上发表的声讨右派分子的报道，则污蔑为“陈词滥调”，“反批评就是党天下的思想”。
