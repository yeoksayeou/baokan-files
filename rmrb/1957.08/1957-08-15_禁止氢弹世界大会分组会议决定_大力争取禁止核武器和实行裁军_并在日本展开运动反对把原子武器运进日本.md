The Third World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament, held on August 13th in nine group meetings, unanimously agreed that it is necessary to vigorously demand that the United Nations and governments of all countries prohibit nuclear weapons and implement arms reduction in the future.

    The student meeting, attended by approximately six hundred Japanese and foreign student representatives, decided to launch a unified international student movement demanding the prohibition of nuclear weapons.

    The youth meeting also issued a "Letter to the Youth of the World," calling on the youth of all countries to stand at the forefront of the struggle to prohibit nuclear weapons.
