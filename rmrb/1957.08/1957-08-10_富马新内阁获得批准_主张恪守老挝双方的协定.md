Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 9th: Vientiane Dispatch: The Lao National Assembly today approved Prince Souvanna Phouma's new cabinet with 26 votes in favor, 8 against, and 1 abstention.

The new cabinet, consisting of only six members, is led by Phouma (National Party) as Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense, Veterans Affairs, and Propaganda; Phoumi Nosavan, leader of the Independent Party, as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Public Works, Construction, and Urban Planning; and Katay Don Sasorith, leader of the National Party who has twice failed to form a cabinet, as Minister of Interior, Economy, and Social Welfare. The other three cabinet members are non-partisan.

In a speech to the National Assembly on August 8th, requesting authorization to form a cabinet, Phouma said that restoring the unity of the Kingdom of Laos by resolving the issue of the Pathet Lao fighting forces remains the number one urgent task for the country.

Phouma said that the problem can only be resolved if both sides strictly and faithfully adhere to the agreements signed by the Royal Government and the Pathet Lao fighting forces, especially the agreement signed on December 28, 1956, regarding the formation of a coalition government. He said that a government with the participation of the Pathet Lao fighting forces may be formed around October 1st.

Phouma said that in terms of foreign policy, the government will pursue a policy of peace and neutrality, abide by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and will welcome foreign aid from wherever it comes, as long as such aid does not conflict with the sovereignty of Laos.

After Phouma resigned on May 30, Sasorith and others failed to form a cabinet three times. Therefore, he was re-appointed on July 26 to reorganize a new cabinet.

    富马新内阁获得批准
    主张恪守老挝双方的协定
    据新华社河内9日电　万象消息：老挝国民议会今天以二十六票赞成、八票反对和一票弃权，批准了梭发那·富马亲王组织的新内阁。
    这个仅由六位阁员组成的新内阁由富马（国家党）担任首相兼国防、退伍军人和宣传大臣；独立党领袖冯·萨纳尼空任外交、公共工程、建设和城市计划大臣；曾经两次组阁失败的国家党领袖卡代·萨索里特任内政、经济和社会福利大臣。内阁中的其他三位阁员都是无党派人士。
    富马8日在国民议会会议上发表要求授权组阁的演说时说，用解决寮国战斗部队问题的办法来恢复老挝王国的统一，仍然是全国头一号迫切任务。
    富马说，要使问题得到解决，只有双方严格而忠实地遵守王国政府和寮国战斗部队所签订的协定，特别是在1956年12月28日签订的关于成立联合政府的协议。他说，有寮国战斗部队参加的政府可能在10月1日前后组成。
    富马说，在对外政策方面，政府将奉行和平中立的政策，遵守和平共处五项原则，并且将欢迎无论来自那里的外国援助，只要这种援助同老挝的主权没有抵触。
    富马在5月30日辞职后，已有萨索里特等人三次组阁没有成功。因此又在7月26日受命重组新阁。
