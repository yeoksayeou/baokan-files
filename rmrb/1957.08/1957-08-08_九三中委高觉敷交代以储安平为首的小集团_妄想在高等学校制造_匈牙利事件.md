Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, July 7th. Gao Juefu, a member of the Central Committee of the Jiu San Society and vice president of Nanjing Normal College, after nine self-criticisms at the rectification meeting of the Nanjing Branch of the Jiu San Society, began to admit that he organized a small clique to attack the Communist Party in an attempt to create a "Hungarian incident" in universities.

Gao Juefu confessed that as early as April this year, a standing committee member of the Central Committee of the Jiu San Society came to Nanjing and instructed him: "Participate in the dictatorship, implement supervision; connect with the masses, educate the masses." This standing committee member also told him: "Now is a time of great development; half of the five million intellectuals are still non-Party members." He also said: "It is not enough to oppose bureaucracy now; we must oppose autocracy." Soon after, Gao Juefu went to Beijing to attend a meeting convened by the Central Committee of the Jiu San Society. Xue Yu, the organization minister of the Jiu San Society (a rightist, member of the Central Committee of the Jiu San Society, and director of the Department of Pharmacy at Beijing Medical College), expressed support for his proposition of "maintaining characteristics and vigorously developing." Therefore, he and Zhou Shilu, deputy director of the East China Agricultural Science Research Institute, member of the Central Committee of the Jiu San Society, and deputy director of the Nanjing Branch, publicly advocated "great development" at the meeting. Their joint speech was appreciated and supported by Chu Anping. Gao Juefu said: "Our small clique was thus organized with Chu Anping as the head, including Chen Shiwei of Lanzhou University (a rightist, vice president of Lanzhou University, member of the Central Committee of the Jiu San Society), Lu Kanru of Shandong University (a rightist, vice president of Shandong University, member of the Central Committee of the Jiu San Society), and Dong Weichuan of Beijing Normal University (a rightist, member of the Central Committee of the Jiu San Society, and vice provost of Beijing Normal University). During the meeting, we often talked about the contradictions between the Party and the masses for two full days, and finally reached a consensus: on the one hand, maintain characteristics and vigorously develop; on the other hand, attack the Communist Party."

Gao Juefu confessed that after Chu Anping went to Guangming Daily, he acted in accordance with the editorials and news published in Guangming Daily. Not only did he accept it, but Lu Kanru and Chen Shiwei also accepted the ideological leadership of Guangming Daily.

Gao Juefu said that after he returned to Nanjing, he actively engaged in activities to develop the organization, intending to increase the number of branch organizations from the original nine to thirty-eight, and specifically sought out people who were dissatisfied with the Party as development targets. He, Zhou Shilu, and Ni Hesheng, a member of the Nanjing Branch of the Jiu San Society and a rightist, formed a clique to control the Nanjing Branch of the Jiu San Society. Zhou Shilu set fires at the East China Agricultural Science Research Institute, attacking the Party member deputy director and openly usurping the leadership of the rectification movement in the institute, establishing a study committee without Party and government leadership. Gao Juefu set fires at Nanjing Normal College, attacking the Party member vice president and demanding "democratic school management." Gao Juefu said that his actions were in line with the program of the Zhang-Luo anti-Party alliance. He said: "The Zhang-Luo alliance had two programs for seizing leadership of universities and colleges: the minimum program was 'democratic school management'; the maximum program was to have the CCP Party committee withdraw from universities and colleges."

Gao Juefu confessed, "I also want to promote the experience of the rightist Zhou Shilu in setting fires at the East China Agricultural Science Research Institute, that is, to create a 'Hungarian incident' in universities and colleges to restore capitalism."

    九三中委高觉敷交代以储安平为首的小集团
    妄想在高等学校制造“匈牙利事件”
    新华社南京7日电　九三学社中央委员、南京师范学院副院长高觉敷在九三学社南京分社的整风会上，经过九次检查，开始承认他组织小集团向共产党进攻，是企图在高等学校中制造“匈牙利事件”。
    高觉敷交代说，早在今年4月间，九三学社中央有个常务委员来南京对他作了指示：“参加专政，实行监督；联系群众，教育群众。”这个常务委员并对他说：“现在是大发展的时候，五百万知识分子，还有一半是无党无派”。又说：“现在反官僚主义还不够，要反专制主义”。不久高觉敷到北京参加九三学社中央召开的会议，九三学社的组织部长薛愚（右派分子、九三学社中央委员、北京医学院药学系主任）对他的“保持特点、大力发展”的主张表示支持。于是，他就同华东农业科学研究所副所长、九三学社中央委员、南京分社副主任委员周拾禄一起在大会上公开主张“大发展”。他们的联合发言得到了储安平的赞赏和支持。高觉敷说：“我们的小集团就这样以储安平为首组织起来了，其中包括兰州大学的陈时伟（右派分子、兰州大学副校长、九三学社中央委员）、山东大学的陆侃如（右派分子、山东大学副校长、九三学社中央委员）和北京师范大学的董渭川（右派分子、九三学社中央委员、北京师范大学副教务长）等人。在开会期间，我们常在一起大谈党和群众的矛盾，谈了两天之久，最后取得了一致的意见，就是：一方面保持特点，大力发展；一方面向共产党进攻。”
    高觉敷交代说，储安平到光明日报后，我就按照光明日报所发表的社论和消息办事。不仅我接受了，而且陆侃如、陈时伟也都接受了光明日报的思想领导。
    高觉敷说，他回到南京后就积极活动发展组织，要把分支组织由原来的九个发展到三十八个，发展对象专找对党不满的人。他和周拾禄以及九三学社南京分社委员、右派分子倪鹤笙三人结成一气，控制了九三学社南京分社。周拾禄在华东农业科学研究所放火，攻击党员副所长，并公然篡夺了研究所的整风领导权，成立了不要党政领导的学习委员会。高觉敷在南京师范学院放火，攻击党员副院长，要求“民主办校”。高觉敷说，他这样做是符合章罗反党联盟的纲领的。他说：“章罗联盟争夺高等院校的领导权有两个纲领，最低纲领是‘民主办校’；最高纲领是要中共党委会退出高等院校。”
    高觉敷交代说，“我还要推广华东农业科学研究所右派分子周拾禄放火的经验，就是想要在高等院校中制造出一个‘匈牙利事件’来，恢复资本主义”。
