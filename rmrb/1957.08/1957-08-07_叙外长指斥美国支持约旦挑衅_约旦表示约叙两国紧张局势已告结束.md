Xinhua News Agency, August 6th, Damascus dispatch: Syrian Foreign Minister, Bitar, said on August 5th that Jordan's ultimatum to Syria, threatening the use of force, was supported by the United States.

Bitar, at his weekly press conference, accused the United States of making the creation of disputes between Arab countries the foundation of its Middle East policy.

Bitar said that Syria bears no responsibility for the tension between Syria and Jordan.

He said that Syria will continue to adhere to a policy of active neutrality, despite the fact that some countries are trying to oppose this policy under the pretext of anti-subversion activities.

Bitar also said, "We have noticed that certain non-Arab and non-Lebanese citizens are carrying out frantic anti-Syrian activities on Lebanese soil. Because of this situation, it is impossible to expect complete unity between Arab countries."

According to Amman reports, the Jordanian government issued a statement on August 5th stating that after "extremely friendly" talks between Jordanian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Rifai and Syrian Chargé d'affaires to Jordan, Rahbi, the tensions between the two countries had ended. The meeting took place on the afternoon of August 5th. According to the statement, Jordan hopes that relations between the two countries "will open a new page."

On the same day, an official Syrian communique stated that Syrian President Kuwatly will continue to stay in Switzerland for medical treatment. The communique said that the Syrian President, after learning that Jordan had issued an ultimatum to Syria, had decided to suspend his medical treatment in Switzerland. Now, as the situation has eased, the President has decided to continue his treatment in Switzerland.

    叙外长指斥美国支持约旦挑衅
    约旦表示约叙两国紧张局势已告结束
    新华社6日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚外交部长比塔尔8月5日说，约旦向叙利亚发出以武力相威胁的最后通牒是得到美国的支持的。
    比塔尔在每周记者招待会上指责美国把在阿拉伯国家之间制造纠纷作为它的中东政策的基础。
    比塔尔说，对于造成叙利亚和约旦之间的紧张局势，叙利亚不负任何责任。
    他说，叙利亚将继续坚持奉行积极中立政策，尽管有些国家正试图以反颠复活动为借口来反对这种政策。
    比塔尔还说，我们注意到，某些非阿拉伯和非黎巴嫩公民正在黎巴嫩土地上进行反对叙利亚的疯狂活动。由于这种情况，就不可能期望阿拉伯国家之间的完满团结。
    据安曼消息，约旦政府8月5日发表声明说，在约旦副首相兼外交大臣里法伊同叙利亚驻约旦代办拉赫比进行了“极为友好的”会谈以后，这两个国家间的紧张局势已告结束。这次会谈是在8月5日下午进行的。据这个声明说，约旦希望两国之间的关系“将揭开新的一页”。
    同一天，叙利亚官方发表的一项公报说，叙利亚总统库阿特利将继续留在瑞士养病。这项公报说，叙利亚总统在知道约旦向叙利亚发出最后通牒以后，曾经决定中止在瑞士养病，现在由于局势已经缓和，总统决定继续在瑞士进行治疗。
