The Battle of Tears and Snot
    (A Sketch from the Expanded Meeting of the Chinese Writers Association Party Group)
    Li Zhuozhao

    It seems that lying is also an instinct, so it can be used effortlessly today.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　      ——"Miss Sophie's Diary"

    When she brandished her sharp sword to show off her defiance to the Party, she spoke sharply and sternly, cried and made a fuss, and cursed and slandered like an endless river. When she shot arrows coated with poison into your soul, she was full of smiles, spoke softly, and generously gave you unlimited warmth. Now she has put on a new face, stammering and hesitating, as if a small snake is tightly blocking her throat. Asking her to confess her personal ambition, "Oh dear, I really can't remember." Asking her to confess her anti-Party activities, "Oh dear, my head hurts again..." "I rowed a boat with Zhang San, played Go with Li Si, and yes, I also looked for Wang Wu a few times, because he was the branch secretary." "If you say that's anti-Party, then so be it, anyway, I can't remember anything. Blame me for being a liberal, arrogant, and a bit sentimental." As she spoke, two lines of tears flowed quickly, as she spoke, her voice became very strange, as she spoke, she took out a small handkerchief, as she spoke, she wiped it over and over again. Peeking secretly after moving the handkerchief away, no one was moved at all! Tears and snot fell in vain, and no one applauded the clumsy trick. Might as well go all the way, cover her face and cry softly, anyway, tears are worthless, let me give you a soft grinding and endless entanglement! Enough, put away this outdated magic weapon, save the handkerchief from getting dry and wet, wet and dry again; tears and snot can only bring disgust and resentment, don't even think about getting away with it by fooling around!

　　眼泪鼻涕之战
    （中国作家协会党组扩大会上的速写）
    李浊照
    好像扯谎也是本能一样，所以在今天能毫不费力的便使用了。
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　      ——“莎菲女士的日记”当她挥起利剑向党霍霍地示威，她疾言厉色，大哭大闹，咒骂、污蔑像不尽的河水。当她用涂着毒液的箭，射进你的灵魂，她满脸笑容，低声细语，慷慨地给你无限温存。如今她换上一副新面容，支支吾吾，吞吞吐吐，就像有一条小蛇，把喉咙紧紧塞住。要她交代个人野心，“啊哟，我实在记不清。”要她坦白反党活动，“啊哟，我的头又痛……”“同张三划过船，同李四下过围棋，对了，还找过几回王五，因为他是支部书记。“要说是反党这些就是，反正我怎么也记不清。怪只怪我是个自由主义骄傲自满，加上点儿温情。”说着说着两行眼泪淌得快，说着说着声音变得好奇怪，说着说着掏出一条小手绢，说着说着擦过去又擦过来。挪开手绢偷偷瞧一瞧，谁都没有感动分毫！眼泪鼻涕一齐落了空，蹩脚的把戏没个人叫好。一不做，二不休，索性捂起脸来哭幽幽，反正眼泪不值钱，给你们来个软磨硬缠鬼打踿！够了，收起这套过时的法宝吧，省得手绢干了又湿，湿了又干；眼泪鼻涕只能招来厌恶和愤恨，休想靠这些蒙混过关！
