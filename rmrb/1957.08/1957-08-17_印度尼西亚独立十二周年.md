    Twelfth Anniversary of Indonesian Independence
    On August 17, 1945, the first red and white flag was raised in Yogyakarta, the ancient city and political, cultural, and artistic center of Central Java, marking the birth of our friendly neighbor, the Republic of Indonesia.
    The Indonesian people endured nearly three and a half centuries of darkness under Dutch colonial rule. But the Indonesian people bravely resisted, one after another.
    After the Japanese army occupied Indonesia in 1942, the Indonesian people continued their struggle for independence and launched an anti-Japanese guerrilla war. In the same year that Japan surrendered, Sukarno signed the declaration of independence, organized the masses to seize weapons from the Japanese army, occupied important enterprises, overthrew the rule of the Japanese invaders, and established the Republic of Indonesia.
    The imperialists were unwilling to see Indonesia gain independence. Shortly after the establishment of the Republic, Britain, under the pretext of disarming the Japanese army, sent troops into Indonesian territory and then handed over the occupied areas to the Netherlands. Subsequently, the Dutch colonialists, with the support of American and British imperialism, launched two wars of aggression in an attempt to strangle the Republic of Indonesia. However, the heroic resistance of the Indonesian people and the just support of the people of all countries finally forced the Netherlands to sign a ceasefire agreement on May 7, 1949.
    Seeing that it could not strangle Indonesia's independence by force, the Netherlands attempted to maintain its colonial rule through political conspiracies. On November 2, 1949, the Indonesian government signed the Hague Round Table Conference Agreement with the Netherlands. The agreement stipulated that the United States of Indonesia and the Kingdom of the Netherlands would form the Netherlands-Indonesia Union, with the Netherlands enjoying privileges in diplomacy, economy, and military affairs. The Indonesian people opposed the "divide and rule" federal system and opposed forming a union with the Netherlands, launching a nationwide unification movement. In August 1950, the Provisional House of Representatives of the United States of Indonesia passed the "Draft Constitution of a Unitary State" and announced the abolition of the federal system on August 15, establishing a unified Republic of Indonesia. In August 1954, it forced the Netherlands to negotiate and reach an agreement to abolish the "Netherlands-Indonesia Union."
    On March 26 last year, the first Indonesian parliament based on universal suffrage was officially established, and later a Constituent Assembly was also established.
    The path that the Republic of Indonesia has traveled since its founding has not been smooth, and it still needs to strengthen national unity and consolidate national independence. But Indonesia's progress along the road of independence, democracy, and prosperity cannot be stopped by any force. (Liang Shu) (Attached picture)

    印度尼西亚独立十二周年
    1945年8月17日，在中爪哇的政治文化艺术中心的古老城市日惹升起了第一面红白旗，我们友好的邻邦印度尼西亚共和国诞生了。
    印度尼西亚人民曾经在荷兰的殖民统治下度过了将近三个半世纪的黑暗的岁月。但印度尼西亚人民前仆后继地进行了英勇的反抗。
    1942年日军侵占印度尼西亚后，印度尼西亚人民争取独立的斗争继续进行，展开了抗日游击战争。日本投降的当年，苏加诺签署了独立宣言，组织群众从日军手中夺取武器、占据重要企业，推翻了日本侵略者的统治，建立了印度尼西亚共和国。
    帝国主义者是不甘心印度尼西亚获得独立的。共和国成立不久，英国就借口解除日军武装，把军队开入印度尼西亚领土，接着又把占领地区移交给荷兰。此后，荷兰殖民者就在美、英帝国主义的支持下发动了两次企图扼杀印度尼西亚共和国的侵略战争。但是，印度尼西亚人民的英勇抗战和各国人民的正义声援，终于迫使荷兰于1949年5月7日签订了停战协定。
    荷兰看到用武力扼杀不了印度尼西亚的独立，曾企图用政治阴谋来保持殖民统治。1949年11月2日，印度尼西亚政府同荷兰签订了海牙圆桌会议协定。协定规定由印度尼西亚联邦共和国和荷兰王国组成荷兰—印度尼西亚联邦，荷兰享有外交、经济和军事等方面的特权。印度尼西亚人民反对分而治之的联邦制，反对和荷兰组成联邦，全国掀起了争取统一运动。1950年8月，印度尼西亚联邦临时众议院通过了“单一化国家宪法草案”，在8月15日宣布取消联邦制，成立统一的印度尼西亚共和国。1954年8月迫使荷兰进行谈判、达成取消“荷兰—印度尼西亚联邦”的协议。
    去年3月26日，印度尼西亚第一个建立在普选基础上的国会正式成立，后来还成立了制宪议会。
    印度尼西亚共和国建国以来所经历的道路不是平坦的，现在还有待于加强民族团结，巩固国家的独立。但印度尼西亚沿着独立、民主、繁荣的道路前进，是任何势力所不能阻挡的。  （梁恕）（附图片）
