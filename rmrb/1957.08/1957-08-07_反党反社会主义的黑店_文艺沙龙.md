In the anti-rightist struggle within the literary and art departments of Hunan Province and Changsha City, a rightist group headed by Kang De, Standing Committee Member of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, Vice Chairman of the Changsha Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, and Director of the Changsha Municipal Bureau of Culture, has been exposed—the "Literary Salon." The members of this "Literary Salon" and its peripheral organizations infiltrated almost all cultural and artistic departments of the province and city. Taking advantage of the Communist Party's rectification movement, they launched a frenzied attack on the literary and art departments of Hunan Province and Changsha City, led by the Party, in an organized, planned, programmatic, and tactical manner.

The right-wing group headed by Du Maizhi, Secretary-General of the Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, was a stronghold of the Zhang-Luo alliance in Hunan. Kang De was a core member of the Du Maizhi right-wing group. In their frenzied attack on the Party, they each had their own division of labor, with Kang De's sharp knife pointed at the literary and art departments. Therefore, the Zhang-Luo Alliance—the Du-Kang Alliance—Kang's "Literary Salon" formed a black line of anti-communism and anti-socialism.

The "Literary Salon" was established in the early days of liberation. Since liberation, the core members of this reactionary group have gradually seized many important positions in provincial and municipal literary and art organizations. Kang De was the Director of the Changsha Municipal Bureau of Culture, Wei Mengke was the Director of the Hunan Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Chen Yuxin was the Director of the Hunan Provincial Cultural Relics Work Committee, Tian Hong was the Manager of the Hunan Theater, Jiang Shoushi was the Manager of the Yin Xing Cinema, Yan Guaiyu was a teacher at the Changsha Normal School, and Zhai Yi was the Artistic Director of the Hunan Provincial Shadow Puppet Troupe. But they wanted to further exclude Communist Party members and seize all power. Among them, except for Tian Hong, who was a developing target of the China Democratic League and had not yet joined, and Chen Yuxin, who was a Standing Committee Member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK) Provincial Committee, the rest were members of the China Democratic League, and they were all representatives of the provincial and municipal people's congresses or members of the CPPCC. After the establishment of this reactionary organization, they met weekly at the Yinyuan Tea House in Changsha City or in private homes, offering each other suggestions and looking for loopholes to attack the Party. They all considered themselves literati, so they called this kind of gathering a "Literary Salon." During this Party rectification movement, they gathered even more frequently to study the tactics and methods of attacking the Party.

The peripheral organizations of the "Literary Salon" also included the "Zhuanzhuanhui" (also known as the Sunday Meeting), composed of members of the China Democratic League and non-League rightists. They used these peripheral organizations to win over a large number of so-called "new forces." According to current investigations, they have established their own strongholds in the main departments of the provincial and municipal cultural bureaus, the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Provincial Literary and Art Cadre School, the Hunan People's Publishing House, the Hunan People's Broadcasting Station, and many other units. They also communicated with right-wing elements in Guangzhou City, such as Dong Meikan.

At the end of last year, a so-called "inspection of League affairs" working group sent by the China Democratic League Central Committee, controlled by right-wing ambitious figures, peddled the "private goods" of the Zhang-Luo alliance, "criticizing" the Hunan Democratic League for "not keeping up with the situation" and having serious "closed-doorism." This made the Du-Kang right-wing group overjoyed, shouting everywhere that "more people make it easier to be king" and that "the China Democratic League has a future." They frequently held meetings to specifically study and arrange for the development of League members at various League meetings, large and small, and sent out a large number of "capable" cadres to use all despicable means to pull people into the League. For example, they nonsensically said that "mutual supervision is mainly the China Democratic League's supervision of the Communist Party," "the China Democratic League organization only accepts instructions from the CCP Central Committee," "the China Democratic League is the most knowledgeable, skilled, and capable political party, and even if a Communist Party member joins the League without knowledge or ability, they are not wanted," and used deceptive, threatening, and enticing means such as "join the League first, then the Party" and that someone was "decided by the Party to join the League" to pull people into the League, attempting to replace the Party with the League.

In early May, when Hunan began to extensively air views, the right-wing elements of the "Literary Salon" put forward a so-called preliminary "battle program" full of gunpowder: "Hold on to the Municipal Bureau of Culture, attack the Provincial Bureau of Culture." Their "strategy" was: "Attack from above and below, attack from inside and outside, set fires everywhere." Above, they fabricated facts to accuse the Provincial Bureau of Culture to the central government and the provincial Party committee; below, they incited, spread rumors, set fires, and stirred up trouble among artists and the masses; internally, they won over cadres and infiltrated the Party; externally, they seized artists, cultural figures, and those dissatisfied with the Party, and also had a set of insidious and vicious methods of "catching" if they couldn't "grab," and "hitting" was for the sake of "grabbing." Their slogan of attack was: "We must air views until the sky is full of stars, we must release ten thousand zhang of sparks." Kang De and other right-wing leaders issued "combat orders" at gatherings: "Attack once, then attack again!" The "Literary Salon" right-wing group frequently gathered to discuss how to launch a "general offensive" against the Party. Three days before the Hunan Provincial CPPCC meeting held in late May, they gathered at the home of right-wing core member Jiang Shoushi to study the five principles for making speeches: (1) Speak from your own profession, and if you make suggestions from your own work, the leader's shortcomings will naturally be exposed; (2) Do not name names in your speech, as long as the opinions are put forward, someone will be responsible; (3) Grasp the facts and look for gaps in the work; (4) The target of the attack is the Provincial Bureau of Culture, and the attack must be fierce and accurate; (5) It is necessary to mobilize the "masses," to seize artists, cultural figures, and people attending the Provincial CPPCC meeting, and to create an atmosphere of airing views. According to this "offensive" principle, they also made specific divisions of labor. For example, Kang De attacked the Party's literary and art leadership and the Party newspaper—New Hunan Daily, etc.

As a result, they attacked the Party in many airing-of-views meetings, echoing each other and supporting each other. Kang De, Jiang Shoushi, and Tian Hong once spread rumors that "the reform of Hunan opera work is a mess" and that "old artists will be forced to hang themselves and jump off buildings." Wei Mengke and Chen Yuxin shouted: "Hunan's literary and artistic creation is not flourishing, and there is almost no literary and artistic criticism." "New Hunan Daily is old-fashioned and has no vitality at all. It should be considered whether to continue to let this flower bloom." Kang De declared: "Marxism-Leninism cannot lead the work of opera reform," and Wei Mengke put forward the fallacy that "Chairman Mao's speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art is no longer sufficient." Chen Yuxin openly clamored: "The Communist Party should put away Marxism-Leninism!" They also openly tampered with Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policies, saying that "the political standard first and the artistic standard second is wrong; it should be art first, or at least art and politics should be parallel." Kang De also slandered that in Hunan "literati are despised" and "democratic people have positions but no power," and he even arrogantly shouted: "There is not a single person in the Hunan Party who understands cultural undertakings." Other right-wing elements of this group also said that "if the examination system is implemented, all Communist Party members will have to step down" and "wherever Party members go, things will go wrong." Chen Yuxin said hatefully: "One day, I (referring to a Communist) will have a white knife in and a red knife out with him." It can be seen to what extent their hatred of the Communist Party has reached!

These cunning and slippery right-wing core members mainly attacked the Party through the China Democratic League and the "Literary Salon" organization. They held several grassroots cadre meetings of the China Democratic League to carry out "mobilization," calling on everyone to identify the targets when making suggestions: "Only mention Party members, not democratic people; only mention shortcomings, not achievements." They said, "The more acute the suggestions are, the better, grievances can be expressed, and there must be a torrential downpour." They also said that "the Chinese revolution cannot be led by the Communist Party," "peasants were not originally willing to struggle against landlords in the land reform, the struggle was a sham," and slandered the "Three-Anti and Five-Anti" movements as "grabbing a tax," and shouted that "the suppression of counter-revolutionaries has been expanded," and incited the targets of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries to write articles to "cry out injustice." Xiao Yunduan, a class teacher at the Provincial Literary and Art Cadre School who was pulled over by right-wing elements, openly encouraged students to take to the streets to demonstrate.

Kang De and the "Literary Salon" he led also conspired to provoke relations between the Party and the masses in literary and art circles. Last year, the central government allocated 200,000 yuan and the province allocated 140,000 yuan to help artists with financial difficulties, but Kang De said that he had appealed to the central government and to Tian Han before the provincial Party committee was forced to take these measures. The right-wing elements of the "Literary Salon" also frequently used the name of Tian Han, chairman of the China Theatre Association, to collect distorted materials everywhere as "evidence" and "reasons" to attack the Provincial Bureau of Culture.

During the airing-of-views period, this reactionary group also frequently held banquets to celebrate their "victory," and arrogantly said: "This time, ten thousand crossbows have been fired together. It seems that the reorganization of the Provincial Bureau of Culture is set." Therefore, they took the opportunity to make a complete "takeover plan" for the provincial and municipal literary and art departments. They also planned the organizational structure and the entire list of personnel for the so-called "Tongrenbao" (comrades' newspaper) and "Tongren Theater Troupe." They also attacked New Hunan Daily and the state-owned Hunan Xiang Opera Troupe.

They were so arrogant that they had already drawn up a complete list of successors for the leading cadres of the provincial and municipal literary and art departments after they stepped down. The main figures on this list were: Du Maizhi as Director of the Provincial Department of Education and Vice Chairman of the Hunan Provincial CPPCC, Kang De as Director of the Provincial Bureau of Culture, Chen Yuxin as Deputy Director of the Bureau of Culture, Yan Guaiyu as Director of the Changsha Municipal Bureau of Culture, Wei Mengke as Director of the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles and Editor-in-Chief of Tongrenbao, Jiang Shoushi as Manager of the Hunan Theater, Tian Hong as head of the state-owned Xiang Opera Troupe or the Tongren Theater Troupe, Zhai Yi as head of the Provincial Shadow Puppet Troupe or leader in the art circles, etc. They also planned to replace thirty people at the Hunan People's Publishing House. They attempted to place Hunan's literary and art circles completely under the "uniform" rule of the "Literary Salon" right-wing group.

Their actions to usurp the editorial department of Hunan Province's only literary publication—"New Sprouts"—had already begun. Here, Wei Mengke and his lover, Communist Party member Zhou Weilin, were in control. The July issue of "New Sprouts" was personally arranged by Wei Mengke, and he specially included some reactionary poems and articles such as "the theory of former mothers-in-law and stepmothers" that cursed Hunan's literary and artistic leadership. Wei Mengke also personally drew a cartoon titled "Report on the Dissemination of Creation," which maliciously attacked the Party's literary and artistic leading cadres. Because the anti-rightist struggle had been vigorously launched, it was hastily removed at the time of publication.

Why do the right-wing group of the "Literary Salon" hate the Party and hate socialism so much? A brief introduction to the history of several right-wing leaders can make it clear.

Kang De joined the Kuomintang in 1924, and after the 1927 May 21st Incident, he also served as a "rehabilitation" instructor (that is, the later concentration camp) in the pseudo "Rehabilitation Institute" that brutally persecuted communists and revolutionary patriots, and as a "Committee Member of the Communist Eradication Committee." He also participated in the "Revival Society." He served as the deputy director and editor-in-chief of Libao and Wanwanbao, which were run by the Kuomintang secret agent leaders Tang Zong and Lei Xiling. He was a famous "local tyrant" in Changsha City and insulted many female artists. On the eve of liberation, he disguised Wanwanbao as "left-leaning" and "progressive" and mixed into the revolutionary ranks.

Chen Yuxin successively served as the dean of education in a certain army of the warlord He Jian and the chief of staff of Liu Jianxu, and also served as a pseudo-administrative commissioner, security commander, and garrison commander. He was also the leader of the reactionary gang "Qiankun Zhengqi Mountain." On the eve of liberation, he speculated on "uprising" and mixed into the revolutionary ranks.

Yan Guaiyu was a traitor who defected to the enemy during the Great Revolution. Together with Kang De, he allied with Kuomintang secret agents, capitalists Lan Zhaoqi, and Revival Society members Ouyang Minne and others. He also had many years of old friendship with Hu Feng and had close relations with the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group. He was also a member of the "Revival Society." He served as a major propaganda officer of the Kuomintang Special Party Headquarters, a pseudo-Central Military Investigation Stock Member, and a major secretary. He also served as the president and editor of Libao and Chenbao, which were run by the bandit Li Zongli and others. He wrote anti-communist editorials and articles full of blood, such as "Communism is not suitable for China" and "The Communist Party is a bandit-style political party."

However, when these right-wing ambitious figures clinked glasses to celebrate "victory," the masses revealed the inside story of the "Literary Salon" and shattered their conspiracy to usurp power. Now, this group has fallen into isolation and is collapsing. The broad masses are closely united around the Party, further waging a relentless struggle against the right-wing elements.

    反党反社会主义的黑店——“文艺沙龙”
    新华社记者　胡坚
    在湖南省和长沙市的文艺部门反右派斗争中，揭发出一个以民盟湖南省委员会常务委员、民盟长沙市委副主委和长沙市文化局局长康德为首的右派集团——“文艺沙龙”。这个“文艺沙龙”和它的外围组织的成员，几乎打入了省市所有文化艺术部门。他们利用共产党整风的机会，有组织、有计划、有纲领、有策略地向党领导的湖南省、长沙市文艺部门发起了猖狂的进攻。
    以民盟省委秘书长杜迈之为首的右派集团是章罗联盟在湖南的据点。而康德又是杜迈之右派集团中的核心分子。他们在向党发动的猖狂进攻中，各有分工，康德的尖刀指向文艺部门。因此，章罗联盟——杜康联盟——康记“文艺沙龙”，形成一条反共反社会主义的黑线。
    “文艺沙龙”在解放初期就成立了。这个反动集团的核心分子在解放以来陆续窃踞了省、市文艺机关团体许多重要职位。康德是长沙市文化局局长，魏猛克是湖南省文联主任，陈浴新是湖南省文物工作委员会主任，田洪是湖南剧院经理，蒋寿世是银星电影院经理，严怪愚是长沙师范专科学校教员，翟翊是湖南省皮影木偶剧团的艺术指导。但他们还想进一步排除共产党员，把持一切大权。他们中间，除田洪是民盟发展对象尚未入盟和陈浴新是民革省委常委外，其余都是民盟成员，而且他们都是省、市人民代表或政协委员。这个反动组织成立以后，他们每周在长沙市银苑茶厅或私人家里集会，互相献策，寻找向党进攻的缺口。他们都以文人自居，因此他们把这种集会叫做“文艺沙龙”。在这次党的整风运动中，他们更加经常集会研究向党进攻的策略、方式。
    “文艺沙龙”的外围组织，还有由盟员和非盟员右派分子组成的“转转会”（又名星期天会）等。他们通过这些外围组织笼络了大批所谓“新生力量”。根据目前查明的，在省、市文化局的主要科室里、省文联、省文艺干校、湖南人民出版社、湖南人民广播电台等许多单位，他们几乎都建立了自己的据点。他们还和远在广州市的右派分子董每戡互通声气。
    去年年底，右派野心家控制下的民盟中央派来了一个所谓“视察盟务”的工作组，贩卖章罗联盟的“私货”，“批评”湖南民盟“赶不上形势”，有严重“关门主义”。这使得杜康右派集团心花怒放，到处叫嚣“人多好称王”，“民盟有搞头了”。他们经常开会专门研究和在民盟各种大小会议上布置、检查发展盟员情况，并派出大批“得力”干部用一切卑鄙手段拉人入盟。如胡说什么“互相监督主要是民盟对共产党的监督”、“民盟组织只接受中共中央的指示”、“民盟是最有知识、技术、本事的政党，没有知识、本事，即使共产党员入盟也不要”，以及用“先入盟，后入党”、某某人“党决定他入盟”等欺骗、威胁、利诱的手段，拉人入盟，企图以盟代党。
    5月初，湖南开始大放大鸣时，“文艺沙龙”的右派分子提出了充满着火药味的所谓初步“战斗纲领”：“守住市文化局，进攻省文化局”。他们的“战略”是：“上下夹攻，内外夹攻，到处点火”。上，就是捏造事实，向中央、向省委告省文化局的“状”；下，就是在艺人群众中挑拨、造谣、点火、熏烟；向内，拉拢干部，打入党内；向外，抓住艺人、文化人和对党不满的分子，还有一套所谓“抓”不到就“打”，“打”就是为了“抓”的阴险恶毒的办法。他们的进攻口号是：“要鸣得满天星斗，要放得万丈火花”。康德等右派首脑在集会上曾发布“攻一下，再攻一下！”的“战斗号令”。“文艺沙龙”右派集团为了商讨如何向党发动“总进攻”经常集会。在5月下旬召开的湖南省政协会议前三天，他们聚集在右派核心分子蒋寿世家里研究出发言的五项原则：（1）说话不离本行，从自己工作岗位上提意见，则领导的缺点自然暴露；（2）发言不要指出姓名，只要意见提出来，自然有人负责；（3）要抓住事实，寻找工作中的缺口；（4）攻击的目标是省文化局，要打得狠、打得准；（5）要发动“群众”，要抓住艺人、文化人和出席省政协会议的人士，要造成鸣放气氛。根据这个“进攻”原则，他们又作了具体分工。如康德攻击党的文艺领导和党报——新湖南报等。
    这一来，他们在许多鸣放会上都是一唱一和、互相呼应地向党进攻。康德、蒋寿世、田洪曾造谣说：“湖南戏改工作一团糟”、“老艺人都会被逼得吊颈、跳楼”。魏猛克、陈浴新就喊叫：“湖南文艺创作不繁荣，文艺批评几乎没有。”“新湖南报老气横秋，没有一点生气，应该考虑是否继续让这朵花开下去。”康德扬言：“马列主义不能领导戏改工作”，魏猛克就提出“毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话已经不够用了”的谬论。陈浴新公开叫嚣：“共产党收起马列主义！”他们还公开篡改毛主席的文艺方针，说什么“政治标准第一，艺术标准第二不对；应该是艺术第一，至少艺术与政治平行”。康德还污蔑地说什么在湖南“是文人被轻”，“民主人士有职无权”，他甚至狂妄地叫喊：“湖南党根本没有一个懂得文化事业的人”，这个集团的其他右派分子还说什么“假使考试制度实行了，所有共产党员都得下台”，“党员到那里，那里就糟”。陈浴新恨恨地说：“老子总有一天，要跟他（指共产党人）来一个白刀子进，红刀子出”。可见他们对共产党的仇恨到了什么程度！
    这些老奸巨滑的右派核心分子，主要是通过民盟和“文艺沙龙”组织，向党进攻的。他们召开过好几次民盟基层干部会议进行“动员”，号召大家提意见要找清对象：“只提党员，不提民主人士；只提缺点，不谈成绩。”说什么“提意见越尖锐越好，牢骚可以发，必须暴风骤雨”。又说什么“中国革命靠共产党是领导不了的”、“土改中农民本不愿斗争地主，斗是假斗”，并污蔑“三反、五反”是“捞一笔税”，叫喊“肃反扩大化了”，并煽动肃反对象写文章“鸣冤”。省文艺干校班主任、被右派分子拉过去的共产党员肖云端，竟公开鼓动学生上街游行。
    康德和他所领导的“文艺沙龙”还阴谋挑拨文艺界的党群关系。去年中央拨款二十万元、省里拨款十四万元，救济生活有困难的艺人，康德却说是他向中央、向田汉呼吁，省委才被迫采取这些措施的。“文艺沙龙”右派分子还经常利用中央戏剧协会主席田汉的名义到处搜集歪曲材料，作为攻击省文化局的“证据”和“理由”。
    在鸣放期间，这个反动集团还经常设宴庆祝他们的“胜利”，并狂妄地说：“这次万弩齐发，看样子省文化局的改组是定了”。于是，他们乘机做出了省市文艺部门全部“接管计划”。他们还筹划所谓“同人报”和“同人剧团”的组织机构和全部人员名单。并大肆攻击新湖南报和国营湖南湘剧团。
  他们狂妄到已拟定了省、市文艺部门领导干部下台后全部继任人选名单。这个名单的主要人物是：杜迈之任省教育厅长、湖南省政协副主席，康德任省文化局局长，陈浴新任文化局副局长，严怪愚任长沙市文化局局长，魏猛克任省文联主任兼同人报社社长，蒋寿世任湖南剧院经理，田洪任国营湘剧团或同人剧团团长，翟翊任省皮影木偶剧团团长或美术界领导人等。并计划在湖南人民出版社换三十人出去。企图把湖南文艺界完全置于“文艺沙龙”右派集团“清一色”的统治之下。
    他们篡夺湖南省唯一文学刊物——“新苗”编辑部的行动早就开始了。在这里，有魏猛克和他的爱人、共产党员周微林掌握着。7月号的“新苗”由魏猛克亲自编排，他特地排上了一些咒骂湖南文艺领导的“前娘后母论”等反动诗文。魏猛克还亲自画了一幅题名“创作传达报告”的对党的文艺领导干部进行恶意攻击的漫画。因为反右派斗争已热烈开展，在出版时，才匆匆把它抽掉。
    “文艺沙龙”的右派集团为什么这样仇恨党、仇恨社会主义呢？只要把几个右派首脑的历史简略介绍一下，就可以知道了。
    康德在1924年就参加了国民党，1927年马日事变后还担任过残酷迫害共产党人和革命志士的伪“感化院”（即后来的集中营）的感化教官和“剿共委员会委员”。他并且参加了“复兴社”。在国民党大特务头子唐纵、雷锡龄等人办的力报、晚晚报担任过副社长和总编辑。他是长沙市有名的“地头蛇”，污辱过许多女艺人。解放前夕，他把晚晚报伪装“左倾”、“进步”，混进革命队伍。
    陈浴新历任军阀何健某部的教育长、刘建绪的参谋长，还做过伪行政专员、保安司令、警备司令等职务。他还是反动帮会“乾坤正气山”的龙头大哥。解放前夕，他投机“起义”，混入革命阵容。
    严怪愚在大革命时期就是一个叛党投敌分子，和康德一起与军统特务分子资本家蓝肇祺、复兴社分子欧阳敏讷等人结盟拜把。而且与胡风有多年旧交，和胡风反革命集团关系密切。他也是“复兴社”分子。曾任国民党特别党部少校宣传干事、伪中央军事调查股员、少校秘书等职。还在李匪宗理等办的力报、晨报中担任过社长、主笔，曾大写反共社论，还写过“共产主义不适合于中国”、“共产党是流寇式的政党”等充满血腥气的文章。
    但是，当这些右派野心家们碰杯庆祝“胜利”的时候，群众揭发了“文艺沙龙”的内幕，粉碎了他们的篡夺阴谋。现在，这个集团已陷于孤立，正在土崩瓦解，广大群众正紧密地团结在党的周围，进一步向右派分子作无情的斗争。
