　　“Lucky Stones” Contain Poison
　　Su Fang
    Rong Zhisui's allegory "Lucky Stones" in the July issue of "Yuhua" contains poison. The article consists of only a few hundred words; however, between the lines, the author fully reveals his dissatisfaction and hatred towards the Party and government's cadre policy and personnel system, and reveals his determination to open fire on the Party.
    This allegory is about the story of electing a king in the forest. The author concocted a necessary condition for those being elected: "From the first day of birth, they should not have made a single mistake." Under this provision, many animals were eliminated. For example, the elephant seemed to be very popular, but after "reviewing the elephant's history," it was found to have "acts of harming life"; the macaque's mournful cry was a "manifestation of unhealthy emotions"; the pine tree dropped a clump of pine needles and scared a little rabbit. In short, no matter who it was, they originally possessed unique "talents," but were rejected because their history was unclear or they had minor shortcomings; and some of these shortcomings were not shortcomings at all, which cannot but make people feel wronged for them! Writing this, I cannot help but say: the author's intention is very profound! However, isn't the author's intention very clear at this point? What he said boils down to proving that the Communist Party "always investigates other people's history," and that the Communist Party does not "employ talents without sticking to one pattern," and so on! And aren't these the arguments chanted by right-wingers?
    Rong Zhisui also arranged an ending for the election in the forest country. That is, "since it is inevitable to make mistakes, and if there are mistakes, one cannot be elected," the result can only be that the silent, motionless stone becomes the king. The finishing touch, the intention of this allegory is very clear at this point. That is to say, things are all bad because of the personnel system, all bad because of the emphasis on the political conditions of cadres, so that those who "occupy high positions" are nothing but useless objects like stones. Look, what a "vivid" and malicious attack!
    This kind of argument that reverses right and wrong and confuses black and white is actually not uncommon. Rong Zhisui is just acting as a mouthpiece for bourgeois right-wingers here. The only difference is that Xiao Qian and his ilk openly scolded our personnel department as a "police station," while Rong Zhisui adopted a more covert method, using the convenience of allegory to express his meaning among birds, animals, insects, and fish.

### “幸运的石头”有毒素

　　“幸运的石头”有毒素
　　苏方
    七月号的“雨花”上戎之随所写的一篇寓言：“幸运的石头”是含有毒素的。文章全部字数不过短短数百；但是字里行间，都充分透露出作者对于党和政府的干部政策、人事制度的不满和仇恨，透露出作者向党开枪的狠心。
    这篇寓言写的是森林中选举国王的故事。作者为被选举者编造了这么一条必备条件：“从生下来的第一天起，就没有犯过一点错儿”。在这一条规定下，许多动物都落选了。例如，老象似乎很膺众望，但是“对老象的历史进行审查”后，发现它有“残害生命的行为”；猕猴因为鸣声凄厉，是“感情不够健康的表现”；松树因为落下过一丛松叶，吓倒了小兔子；总而言之，不管是谁，本来都是有着独具的“才能”的，只是因为历史不清楚，或者小有缺点而遭到摈弃；而且其中有些缺点还是根本不成其为缺点的，这怎能不叫人为它们抱屈哩！写到这里，我不禁要说：作者的用心可谓深矣！然而，作者的意图至此不是也就很清楚了吗？他说来说去，目的不过想证明：共产党“动不动就要查别人的历史”，共产党没有“不拘一格用人才”等等而已！而这些，不正是右派分子所唱的论调吗？
    戎之随也替森林国的选举安排了个结局。那就是“既然动不动就免不了有错，有错就不能当选”，结果只能让不言不笑、一动不动的石头当了国王。画龙点睛，这篇寓言的用意至此也就十分显豁了。这就是说，事情都坏在人事制度，都坏在重视了干部的政治条件，以致“窃居高位”者，无非都是石头一样的无用之物。请看，这是多么“形象”而又恶意的攻击！
    这种颠倒是非、混淆黑白的说法，其实也并不稀奇。戎之随在这里不过是做了资产阶级右派分子的应声虫罢了。所不同者，萧乾之流是明目张胆地谩骂我们的人事部门是“派出所”，而戎之随却采取了较为隐蔽的手段，借寓言之便而寄意于鸟兽虫鱼之间而已。
