    The Plight of Rightist Yu Xieyuan
    By our reporter Fu Dong
    His name is Yu Xieyuan. He is a rightist at the Beijing Institute of Geology and Exploration.
    Yu Xieyuan never attended class properly for a single day in his four years at the school. He was constantly causing trouble and sabotaging. Today he would break the equipment in this classroom, tomorrow he would break the light bulbs in that classroom; he ran to the Mining College and broke the main switch of the water and electricity, he used ice to hit the heads of the school security guards. The students helped him and educated him, but he scolded them for monitoring him.
    During the rectification campaign, his anti-socialist activities became even more frequent. He made contact with rightists Tan Tianrong and Liu Qidi from Peking University and joined the "Hundred Flowers Society," a reactionary clique at Peking University. He put up slogans everywhere, blatantly spreading anti-socialist fallacies. He said, "Socialism is no good! Young people should rise up in revolution!" "Hu Feng is not a counter-revolutionary!" "The Hungarian incident was a revolution!" "The Soviet Union's sending troops to Hungary was interference!"
    In the anti-rightist movement, the students launched a struggle to reason with him, questioning him: "Whose revolution do you want to carry out?". "The Soviet Union, at the invitation of the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Government, sent troops in accordance with the Warsaw Pact. Why is that 'interference'?" "If the Hungarian incident was a revolution, why were so many Communist Party members killed?" He couldn't answer, and then he brazenly cursed the Party members as short-sighted, dogmatic, and conservative. When the students pressed him harder, he stammered, "This is my understanding, that's just how I see it. I am helping the Party with rectification. If you don't agree, I won't force you."
    Yu Xieyuan once went to the Beijing Medical College and secretly posted seven copies of the "Hundred Flowers Society" mimeographed newspaper. When the students at Beijing Medical College saw it, they were furious: "What nonsense is written on this!" They asked him where he came from and why he was posting this kind of reactionary mimeographed newspaper. Yu Xieyuan instead accused them: "Your school's students are really problematic. I came here with good intentions to help you with rectification, and you're stopping me!" More and more people gathered around, and thirty or so people rebuked him one after another. Yu Xieyuan panicked and secretly crumpled up the visitor registration form he had filled out when he came in and threw it away. A student picked up the slip and saw that it read: "Name: Yu Shicheng... Address: Student Building, Fifth Floor, Geological College."
    The students at Beijing Medical College forced him to tear down the remaining two slogans and asked the school security team of the Geological Exploration College to take him back.
    The school held meetings to criticize rightists every two or three days, which caused him great distress. He lost contact with the outside world, and he wanted to go out and find a way.
    One afternoon in mid-July, he came out of the school and walked along the road to a village, where he met a comrade from the Jiujianfang Supply and Marketing Cooperative. "Aren't you the college student who came here before?" the other party warmly invited him to sit in the cooperative. At this, his energy was revived, and he began to speak at length to a large crowd of people: "Ge Peiqi is right, the unified purchase and sale system has been messed up, and the farmers are cursing the Communist Party." "The suppression of counter-revolutionaries has also been messed up." "The Party put forward the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom, but it doesn't allow people to speak!"
    People became vigilant. "Comrade, what are you doing in our village?" someone asked him.
    "Me? I'm here to collect the farmers' opinions of dissatisfaction with the Party."
    The news quickly spread around the village. Forty or fifty people surrounded him.
    People asked him: "You said the farmers are cursing the Communist Party, what materials have you learned?"
    "You farmers have low culture, you wouldn't understand even if I told you, you are hooligans."
    He then wantonly spread anti-communist remarks, but he found that the situation was not good, and people's eyes had changed. One person stood up, pointed at him and said: "The people use their sweat and blood to nurture you, but you come to slander us. We don't want a college student like you." Who do you want to "liberate?" Do you want to come and "liberate" us workers and peasants? We don't need someone like you. The Party has already led us to be liberated from the old society, what else do you want to liberate?
    The next day, the cooperative sent a representative to the school to protest Yu Xieyuan's nonsense and demand that the school criticize and educate him. Yu's fifty-year-old mother, who had heard about this, also rushed over. As soon as the old mother saw him, she said angrily: "Now the government gives you food and lets you study, but you're doing other things." His younger brother and sister, who were in high school, also came. His younger brother rebuked him: "Why are you standing on the side of the enemy to oppose the people? Who are your friends? Who are your enemies? Those anti-socialist rightists are your friends?! The people who are really helping you and want you to take the socialist road, you see them as enemies. I am younger than you, but I am clearer about this than you. You should make a good confession."
    Wherever Yu Xieyuan went, there were people waiting for him to criticize him, and there were angry eyes glaring at him.
    He stinks, he really is "a rat crossing the street, chased by all."

    右派分子俞燮元的窘境
    本报记者　傅冬
    他叫俞燮元。是北京地质勘探学院的右派分子。
    俞燮元进校四年，从没好好上过一天课。成天捣乱、破坏。今天打坏这个教室的用具，明天打破那个教室的电灯；他跑到矿业学院把水电总闸弄坏，他用冰块砸校卫队员的头。同学们帮助他，教育他，他就骂人家监视他。
    整风了，他的反社会主义活动更频繁了。他和北京大学右派分子谭天荣、刘奇弟等接了头，参加了北京大学反动小集团“百花学社”。他到处贴标语，明目张胆地散布反社会主义的谬论。他说，“社会主义不行啦！青年应该起来革命！”“胡风不是反革命！”“匈牙利事件是革命！”“苏联出兵匈牙利是干涉！”
    在反右派运动中，同学们对他展开了说理斗争，责问他道：“你要革什么人的命？”。“苏联应匈牙利工农政府的邀请，根据华沙条约出兵，为什么是“干涉？”“匈牙利事件既是革命，为什么杀了那么多共产党员？”他答不出，就要无赖骂党员是鼠目寸光，是教条主义，是守旧分子。同学们再逼得紧一些他就结结巴巴地说，“这是我的认识，我就是这么认识。我这是帮党整风。你们不同意，我也不强迫你们。”
    俞燮元曾经走进北京医学院，偷偷地贴了七张“百花学社”的油印报。北医的同学一看，火起来了：“这上面乱七八糟的说的是些什么！”问他是那里来的？为什么贴这种反动的油印报？俞燮元反而指责人家：“你们学校的学生真成问题，我好心来帮你们整风，你们还阻止！”周围的人越来越多了，三十多个人你一句我一句数落他。俞燮元有些慌了，偷偷地把进来时填的会客单揉坏扔了。同学捡起条子一看，上面写着：“姓名：俞士城……地址：地质学院学生楼五楼”。
    北医同学逼着他把剩下的二张标语也撕了。并请地质勘探学院的校卫队来把他带了回去。
    学校里三天两天开会批判右派分子，他好生苦恼，和外面的线断了，他出去想寻个办法。
    7月中的一个下午，他从学校出来，顺着公路走到一个村子跟前，碰见了九间房供销社的一位同志。“你不是来过咱们这里的大学生吗？”对方热情地请他去社里坐坐。这一下，他的劲又来了，当着一大群人大讲特讲起来：“葛佩琦说的对，统购统销是搞糟了，农民都骂共产党。”“肃反也搞糟了。”“党提出百家争鸣的方针，可又不许人家说话！”
    人们警惕起来了，“同志，你来我们村子干什么？”有人问他。
    “我吗？我来搜集农民对党不满的意见。”
    消息很快地在村子附近传开了。进来四、五十个人把他包围起来。
    人们问他：“你说，农民骂共产党，你了解到些什么材料？”
    “你们农民文化低，说了你们也不知道，你们是流氓。”
    他接着大肆散布反共言论，可是他发现情况不好了，人们的眼光变了。一个人站起来，指着他道：“人民拿血汗来培养你，你却来污蔑我们。我们不要你这样的大学生。”你要“解放”谁？要来“解放”我们工人、农民吗？我们用不着你这样的人，党已经领导我们从旧社会解放出来，你还要解放什么？
    第二天，合作社派了代表到学校去，抗议俞燮元的胡说，要求学校批评教育他。俞的五十多岁的老妈妈听信也赶来了。老妈妈一见他，就气愤地说：“现在政府给你饭吃，给你书读，你却干别的勾当。”在高中念书的弟弟和妹妹也来了。弟弟斥责他：“你为什么站在敌人的立场反对人民？你的朋友是谁？敌人是谁？那些反社会主义的右派分子是你的朋友？！真正帮你，要你走社会主义的人，你倒把他们看成敌人。我的年纪比你小，可这一点，我比你清楚。你应该好好交代。”
    俞燮元走到那儿，那儿就有批判他的人们等着他，就有愤怒的眼睛瞪视着他。
    他臭透了，他真是“过街的老鼠人人喊打。”
