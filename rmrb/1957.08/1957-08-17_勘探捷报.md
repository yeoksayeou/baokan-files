    Exploration Successes
    Hubei Discovers Large Phosphate Mine
    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 16th: A large phosphate mine has been discovered in the Yicheng and Zhongxiang area of Hubei.

    The central section of this mining area alone is 26 kilometers long, with two ore beds each ranging from 10 to 12 meters thick. The ore beds are very stable and suitable for large-scale open-pit mining. Tests show that the phosphate ore here contains as much as 28% to 38% phosphorus (generally, phosphate ore containing 8% phosphorus is considered minable). Such a high phosphorus content is rare among the phosphate mines already discovered in the country.

    This phosphate mine is located near the Jingzhou-Xiangyang Highway and the Han River, making transportation convenient. Further exploration is currently underway.
    Nickel Mine Discovered in Xichang Prefecture
    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 15th: The Sichuan Provincial Geological Bureau exploration team has discovered a nickel mine with industrial value in the Lima River area, at the junction of Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, in Huili County, Xichang Prefecture.

    Nickel ore is generally found in basic rocks. According to existing geological exploration data, the Lima River nickel ore is mostly found in pyroxenite. Based on reports from the masses and reconnaissance surveys, numerous outcrops of this nickel-bearing pyroxenite also appear in the periphery of the mining area. Currently, geological exploration personnel are accelerating peripheral prospecting for nickel and exploration work in the mining area.

    Nickel is an important industrial metal. It can be smelted into nickel steel, nickel iron, nickel-chromium, and other alloys. In particular, nickel steel is strong and durable, a high-grade quality steel widely needed by the tractor, automobile, and machine tool manufacturing industries.
    Pyrite Mine Discovered in Wutai County
    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 16th: A pyrite mine has been discovered near Jingangkou in Wutai County, Shanxi. Exploration work on this newly discovered pyrite mine began last month. Materials obtained from drilling have proven that the ore seam thickness, pyrite content, and ore grade all meet industrial requirements. Currently, three drilling rigs are in operation.

    勘探捷报
    湖北发现大磷矿
    据新华社武汉16日电  湖北宜城、钟祥一带发现一个大磷矿。
    这个矿区仅中部地段就有二十六公里长，矿床有两层，每层厚达十公尺到十二公尺，矿层变化很稳定，适合大规模露天开采。经过化验，这里的磷矿含磷高达28％到38％（一般含磷8％就可以开采），这样高的含磷量，在全国已经发现的磷矿中是很少有的。
    这个磷矿位于荆（州）襄（阳）公路和汉水附近，交通方便。现在还在进一步勘探。
    西昌专区发现镍矿
    新华社成都15日电  四川省地质局勘探队在西昌专区会理县川滇交界的力马河地区，发现了具有工业价值的镍矿。
    镍矿一般产于基性岩中，据现有地质勘探资料证实，力马河区镍矿多产于辉石岩中。根据群众报矿和踏勘了解，这种含镍的辉石岩在矿区外围还有不少露头出现。目前，地质勘探人员正在加速外围普查找镍及矿区勘探工作。
    镍是工业上的重要金属之一。它可以炼成镍钢、镍铁、镍铬等合金。特别是镍钢性质坚固，是一种高级优质钢，为拖拉机、汽车工业和机床制造业等所广泛需要。
    五台县发现黄铁矿
    据新华社太原16日电  山西五台县境内金刚库附近发现一个黄铁矿。新发现的这个黄铁矿的勘探工作，已经在上月开始。钻探所得到的材料证明，矿层厚度及黄铁矿含矿率、矿石品位等都合于工业要求。现在，有三台钻机正在钻探。
