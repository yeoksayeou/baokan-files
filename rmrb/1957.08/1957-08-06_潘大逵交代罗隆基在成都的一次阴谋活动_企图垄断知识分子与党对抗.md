Pan Dakui, a key figure in the Zhang-Luo Alliance, has preliminarily confessed to the Zhang-Luo conspiracy in the Sichuan Provincial Democratic League's rectification group meetings over the past week. Last winter, Luo Longji summoned rightists Ma Zhemin, Liu Wangliming, Fan Puzhai, Pan Dakui, Zhang Songtao, and others to gather in Chengdu. During a secret meeting, Luo told them: "The League must compete with the Party in terms of the strength of intellectuals. The League must monopolize intellectuals in order to be on equal footing with the Communist Party and negotiate terms." Luo also said: "Now, we must pay special attention to developing high-level intellectuals to expand the League's ranks. With more talent, there will be more people to assume leadership positions. The Party will have to value the League's strength. Then, through these people, we can create a situation where the Party will have to yield. At that time, the League can gain a leading position, achieve expert governance in schools, and achieve the goal of abolishing the Party committee system."

Regarding the specific steps for the conspiracy to abolish the Party committee system, Pan confessed that: 1. First, emphasize the contradiction between the Party and intellectuals, and try to spread the idea that the Party is an amateur and cannot lead professionals, creating an atmosphere of dissatisfaction with the Party committee system; 2. Emphasize anti-dogmatism; 3. Use the blooming and contendign to cause chaos; 4. Finally, after creating chaos, the Democratic League will clean up the mess.

During his stay in Chengdu, Luo used tea parties to visit and collude with people for individual talks. For example, Luo visited Wei Shizhen, the head of the China Youth Party in Sichuan Province, twice, hoping to bring Wei into the League and use Wei to win over his party members and intellectuals.

The discussions also revealed Luo's conspiracy to usurp national diplomatic leadership. He said that it is very difficult to engage in a united international front now, because the Communist Party is doing it, and there are fewer and fewer people in capitalist countries. In the future, democratic parties should be responsible for engaging in a united international front.

    潘大逵交代罗隆基在成都的一次阴谋活动
    企图垄断知识分子与党对抗
    本报讯　章罗联盟主将潘大逵一星期来在四川省民盟整风小组会上初步交代章罗阴谋。去冬罗隆基召集右派马哲民和刘王立明、范朴斋、潘大逵、张松涛等会师成都，在秘密会商时，罗向他们说：“盟要在知识分子方面和党比力量，盟要垄断知识分子，才能和共产党平起平坐，讲价钱。”罗又说：“现在特别要注意发展高级知识分子，来扩大盟的队伍，人才多了，担任领导工作的也就多了，党就不能不重视盟的力量，然后通过这批人造成形势，党就不能不迁就。那时盟就可取得领导地位，实现专家治校，达到取消党委制的目的。”
    关于阴谋取消党委制的具体步骤潘交代是：一、首先强调党与知识分子有矛盾，尽量散布党是外行不能领导内行的言论，造成对党委制不满的空气；二、强调反教条主义；三、利用鸣放，乱鸣乱放；四、最后造成乱子后由民盟来收拾局面。
    罗在成都期间用茶会拜访形式到处串联个别谈话。如，罗曾两次拜访青年党四川省负责人魏时珍，想拉魏入盟，通过魏来拉拢他的党徒和知识分子。
    座谈中，还暴露了罗企图篡夺国家外交领导权的阴谋，他说，现在要搞国际统一战线很困难，因为产党出面搞，资本主义国家的人愈来愈少了，今后要搞国际统一战线，要民主党派负责才行。
