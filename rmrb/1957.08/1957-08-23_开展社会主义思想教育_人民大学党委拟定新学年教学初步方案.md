Xinhua News Agency, August 22nd—The Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Committee of the Renmin University of China recently formulated a preliminary teaching plan for conducting "Socialist Ideological Education." This plan will be implemented in the new academic year.

The Chinese Communist Party Committee of Renmin University, the teachers of various political theory teaching and research departments, and other social science departments have studied and discussed the reports made by Comrades Lu Dingyi and Kang Sheng at the Beijing Marxist-Leninist Teachers' Report Meeting. Then, combined with the school's and society's experiences and problems in the anti-Rightist struggle, a preliminary teaching plan for socialist ideological education was formulated.

Currently, Renmin University has formed a lecture group. Hu Xikui, Vice President and Party Secretary; Nie Zhen, Vice President and Deputy Party Secretary; Zou Lufeng; Cui Yaoxian, Deputy Party Secretary; members of the Standing Committee of the Party Committee; some department heads; and some political theory course teachers have all joined the lecturing work. It was also decided that an office would be established under the leadership of the Standing Committee of the Party Committee to specifically organize this work.

The preliminary teaching plan for "Socialist Ideological Education" stipulates a one-year study period, one day per week. A total of twelve topics will be lectured on: "The Great Significance of the Struggle Against the Bourgeois Rightists," "The Question of Standpoint," "Socialist Revolution," "Socialist Construction," "On Consolidating the People's Democratic Dictatorship," "Opposing Liberalism and Anarchism," "On Consolidating and Strengthening the Party's Leadership," "On Consolidating Democratic Centralism," "Opposing Individualism and Departmentalism," "Opposing Absolute Egalitarianism," "On Consolidating the Socialist International Unity and the Great Unity of the People of the World," "Opposing Great-Nation Chauvinism and Local Nationalism."

The Party Committee of Renmin University has decided that, starting in the new academic year, all teachers, students, and staff will participate in the "Socialist Ideological Education" course. At the same time, the previously compulsory political theory courses for students, apart from professional courses, will be suspended. The Party Committee also decided that each political theory teaching and research department should assign some teachers to study and improve the teaching of four political theory courses based on the experience of this anti-Rightist struggle and socialist ideological education.

In addition, the school's Party Committee also decided to study and improve all teaching work in various professional courses in accordance with the spirit of Comrade Kang Sheng's report.

　　人民大学党委拟定新学年教学初步方案
    新华社22日讯　中共中国人民大学委员会常委会最近拟定进行“社会主义思想教育”的初步教学方案。这一方案即将在新学年中进行。
    中共中国人民大学委员会和各政治理论教研室及其它社会科学各系的教师都对陆定一、康生两同志先后在北京市马列主义教师报告会所作的报告，进行了研究和讨论，然后结合该校和社会上反右派斗争的经验和问题，拟订了一个社会主义思想教育的教学初步方案。
    现在，人民大学已经组成了一个讲授团。副校长兼党委书记胡锡奎、副校长兼党委副书记聂真、邹鲁凤，党委副书记崔耀先、党委的常务委员、部分系主任以及一部分政治理论课教师等都参加了讲授工作，并且决定由党委常委会领导下，设一个办公室，专门负责组织这一工作。
    “社会主义思想教育”的教学初步方案规定学习期限为一年，每周一天。共讲授以下十二个专题：“反对资产阶级右派斗争的伟大意义”，“立场问题”，“社会主义革命”，“社会主义建设”，“关于巩固人民民主专政”，“反对自由主义和无政府主义”，“关于巩固和加强党的领导”，“关于巩固民主集中制”，“反对个人主义和本位主义”，“反对绝对平均主义”，“关于巩固社会主义的国际团结和全世界人民的大团结”，“反对大民族主义和地方民族主义”。
    人民大学党委会决定从新学年开始，全校师生员工将一律参加“社会主义思想教育”课程的学习。与此同时，学生中除专业课以外，以前共同必修的政治理论课暂停。党委会并决定各政治理论教研室指定部分教师，在这次反右派斗争和进行社会主义思想教育的经验基础上，研究和改进四门政治理论课的教学工作。
    此外，这个学校的党委会还决定在各专业课程中也根据康生同志报告的精神，研究改进全部教学工作。
