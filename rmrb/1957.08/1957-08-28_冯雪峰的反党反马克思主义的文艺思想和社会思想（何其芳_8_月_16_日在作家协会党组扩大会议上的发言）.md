    In recent meetings, after listening to the comrades' exposure of Comrade Feng Xuefeng's anti-Party words and deeds, especially Comrade Xia Yan's exposure, I, like many comrades at the meeting, was very excited and indignant. It turns out that Feng Xuefeng, who has been mixed in the Party for thirty years, is such an anti-Party element and such a personal careerist! In order to achieve his personal goals, he did not hesitate to completely destroy the Party's organizational principles. He could abandon the Shanghai Party organization and rely on people like Hu Feng to carry out activities to split the left-wing literary circles in Shanghai at that time. He could leave the Party on his own and run back to his hometown simply because the Party's responsible comrades criticized him a few words. After the start of this rectification movement, he even set fire in the publishing house he led, calling on rightists and those dissatisfied with the Party to "report grievances and take revenge," and inciting them to attack the Party. He declared, "The flood has reached the gate!" This is his cheering for the rightists' attack!
    I had very little contact with Feng Xuefeng in the past and didn't know much about him. I had only browsed through some of his papers and essays. Now, based on my memory, I would like to also present some materials from these papers and essays to see what kind of literary theory and what kind of anti-Marxist ideas he has been propagating for more than twenty years. Like other anti-Party elements and personal careerists, he would not put all his anti-Party thoughts and activities into writing. But combined with the words and deeds he exposed with the comrades, these materials are also helpful for us to understand Feng Xuefeng's face.
    When I was working in Chongqing in 1945 and 1946, an underground Party member told me that in the eyes of the masses in literary circles, Xuefeng was a member of the Hu Feng faction. This comrade did not know that Xuefeng was also a Party member. But I was very heartbroken when I heard it at the time. Why is it that our Party member, and Comrade Feng Xuefeng, an old Party member who has been engaged in literary work for a long time, did not faithfully implement the Party's literary line, but became a member of the Hu Feng faction in the eyes of the masses? Later, at a gathering of literary circles, Comrade Feng Xuefeng publicly declared that the literary circles in the Kuomintang-controlled area at that time were a desert, and only a few green grasses grew in it, that is, the "July Poetry Series." He was in agreement with Hu Feng in completely denying the progressive literature in the Kuomintang-controlled area at that time, and only praised the "July Poetry Series" edited by Hu Feng. At that time, the Party had already held several literary symposiums in Chongqing, and some Party and non-Party writers participated. At this symposium, Hu Feng's theories and works had already been criticized. The Party was trying to win him over, educate him, and accept the Party's literary line. However, he thought too highly of himself. He did not take the Party's literary line seriously. Hu Feng spoke at the symposium against the idea of political criteria and artistic criteria in Comrade Mao Zedong's speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art. Xuefeng later wrote an article to publicly respond to this. That was the "Aside" he published under the pen name "Painting Room" in the supplement of the Xinhua Daily in January 1946. He ridiculed that the saying of "political character" and "artistic character" could not withstand "asking three times in a row." He said, "To study or evaluate specific works, using abstract algebraic expressions of 'political character' and 'artistic character' can be said to ruin everything." The publication of this article was intended to provoke discussion. So we also wrote articles to criticize him. During this period, he also wrote a long paper called "On the Literary Movement of the Democratic Revolution." This article even tried its best to defend Hu Feng's reactionary literary theory. We criticized the so-called "subjective fighting spirit" advocated by Hu Feng at the symposium. Xuefeng defended it in this article, saying: "These situations should mainly be regarded as approaching and pursuing the revolution, and reflecting the demands of literature and art and the literary movement is very good, and it is exactly what our literature and art hopes for." This is how he beautified Hu Feng's reactionary theory and cheered for it! He even said: "We cannot assume that this is an attempt to inject idealist toxins under the guise of criticizing dogmatism, because there is no such possibility today, and at the same time, it is clearly raising questions under the spiritual pursuit of the revolution." Look at how arbitrary he was in defending Hu Feng! Hu Feng's "subjective" theory is clearly and thoroughly promoting bourgeois idealism, but he insisted that they did not have that kind of "attempt" subjectively, and even objectively there was no such "possibility." That was 1946. That was still in the area ruled by Chiang Kai-shek. Look, at that time, there was no "possibility" of propagating idealism in that place. Hasn't idealism become extinct long ago? What are we still opposing idealism for today? We also criticized the works produced under the guidance of Hu Feng's theory, Lu Ling's works, at the symposium. Xuefeng also defended them in this article. He said, "This is exactly what we require, and it is exactly a major development in our literature and art in recent years." He also said, "According to my feeling after reading it, the parts that reflect the author's own enthusiasm and pursuit of ideals are particularly real, strong, and intimate, and dominate the whole work." Even if there are shortcomings, "at most, it can only be said to be limited by age, thought, social life experience, etc., and it is definitely not misled by any tendency that cannot be developed." Look at how much he appreciates the works of the Hu Feng faction and how hard he tries to defend Hu Feng's reactionary theory! How strange is it that a theorist can disregard facts and theory to such an extent and still think of himself as a Marxist?
    The eyes of the masses are bright. It is in line with reality that they regard Xuefeng as a member of the Hu Feng faction. Although Hu Feng was attached to Xuefeng during the League of Left-Wing Writers period, at this time, the role played by Xuefeng was just an echoer and defender of Hu Feng.
    Later, I browsed through some of Comrade Feng Xuefeng's other papers and essays, and I realized that this was not accidental at all. On many basic and important issues of literature and art, Hu Feng and Xuefeng's arguments are consistent. We simply can't tell who influenced whom. This is a bourgeois literary line, a revisionist literary line, that has been hidden under the cloak of Marxism since the left-wing literary movement. They are trying to seize the fortress of our revolutionary literary movement from within. Many people who study the history of new literature only know that the left-wing literary movement once had dogmatic errors, and they do not know that such an anti-Party and anti-Marxist literary line has existed for a long time. When criticizing Hu Feng, we have already touched on this issue. Now, let's look at Feng Xuefeng's literary thoughts again, and this line will become clearer.
    Like Hu Feng, Comrade Feng Xuefeng does not agree with emphasizing the role of worldview. In 1936, he published "Opinions on Several Issues of the Literary Movement" under the pen name "Lu Keyu" in the "Writer" monthly magazine, and put forward such a point of view, thinking that emphasizing the correct worldview is "the old tune of mechanism." He also said: "For writers, just like a person, reading social science books is certainly an important supplement, but the main thing should be in his life, in his concern and analysis of historical and current events, in his research on works such as Shakespeare or Balzac (neither of them had time to read the works of Marx and Engels in their lifetime), in his absorption of themes, and in the process of his writing to obtain a 'correct worldview'." His view on how writers obtain a correct worldview is also problematic. He reduces the study of Marxism-Leninism to merely a kind of "supplement." He believes that a correct worldview can be obtained from the writer's original life, or even from his research on literary works and writing process. This is also very similar to Hu Feng's argument that ideological transformation can be achieved through creative practice and cultural work. Of course, obtaining a correct worldview cannot only rely on reading Marxist-Leninist works, but the importance of studying theory is far more than just a "supplement." Of course, obtaining a correct worldview depends on our practice, but this kind of practice, as Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out, should mainly be participating in the struggles of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and not just the writer's original life and his artistic practice. Whether or not to admit the importance of a correct worldview, whether or not to admit the necessity of ideological reform, this is one of our fundamental disputes with Hu Feng, that is, one of our fundamental differences with the bourgeois revisionist literary line. On this issue, Comrade Feng Xuefeng not only had the same or similar arguments as Hu Feng in the past, but even after liberation, in his speeches at some meetings, he still maintained this view of underestimating the role of worldview and underestimating theoretical study.
    Like Hu Feng, Comrade Feng Xuefeng denies national forms and denies the utilization of old forms. In 1940, he wrote an article entitled "Nationality and National Forms" (later included in the essay collection "The Era That Has Passed"). In this article, he said that "national forms must and must be internationalized and globalized," "'Nationality' issues have lost their independent significance in culture," and "the 'Nationality' of culture is in the process of being abandoned." This is a direct violation of the Marxist-Leninist view of national culture and national forms. Around 1945, he also wrote an article "On Artistic Power and Others" (see the essay collection "Advancing Without Retreating"). In this article, he said that the old forms "that can be used effectively are very few," that there are "many poisonous and reactionary elements and overly backward things" in folk literature, and that "only a very few elements can be connected with the people's demands for progress in life," and that "the old chapters and novels can be said to have nothing to utilize." He regards the use of old forms as a manifestation of "petty-bourgeoisie" "catering to the petty citizens." This is too similar to those words of Hu Feng in "On the Issue of National Forms" that deny old forms and deny folk literature. Whether or not to admit the importance of national forms, whether or not to admit the necessity of inheriting the country's literary heritage (including folk literature), this is also one of our important disputes with Hu Feng. On this issue, Comrade Feng Xuefeng is also consistent with Hu Feng and opposes the Party's literary policy.
    Like Hu Feng, Comrade Feng Xuefeng downplayed the achievements of progressive literature in the Kuomintang-controlled areas during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and after liberation, he denied the development of people's literature and art in the new China. Everyone knows that Hu Feng has two axes, one is called opposing "subjective formulaism" and the other is called opposing "objectivism." He used these two axes to kill the entire progressive literature and art in the Kuomintang-controlled areas during the War of Resistance Against Japan. He believes that they are all anti-realist things. Comrade Feng Xuefeng completely adopted this weapon manufactured by Hu Feng in "On Artistic Power and Others" and bravely attacked all the progressive writers at that time. Even after the Party had begun to criticize Hu Feng's literary thoughts, the "On the Literary Movement of the Democratic Revolution" written by Comrade Feng Xuefeng continued to curse the works of many progressive writers as "formulaism" and "objectivism." After liberation, Comrade Feng Xuefeng once expressed that he wanted to say goodbye to Hu Feng's literary thoughts, so in some publicly published articles, it is not impossible to find one or two sentences affirming the new people's literature and art. However, his affirmation is often accompanied by great reservations. For example, in "An Outline of the Development of Classical Realism to Proletarian Realism in Chinese Literature," although he had to affirm that the new people's literature and art have new things in terms of content and form, he then said, "In reflecting reality, there are still common shortcomings and errors of subjectivity, one-sidedness, and superficiality," and "the artistic level is still low." This is his general derogation of the new people's literature and art from the content of the works to the artistic level. As for his speeches at meetings that have not been publicly published, he despises and belittles our literature and art today very severely. For example, in his speech at the symposium on studying socialist realism organized by the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles in 1953, he said that "the works published in our current publications are not much different from the compositions of high school and junior high school." What is particularly strange is that he is also the same as Hu Feng in this regard: in the Kuomintang-controlled areas during the War of Resistance Against Japan, he completely blamed the shortcomings of progressive literature and art on the writers, as if these shortcomings had nothing to do with the oppression of the Kuomintang reactionaries; but after liberation in the new China, he blamed the shortcomings of literature and art on the leadership, as if the writers suddenly had no responsibility. In his speech at the above-mentioned symposium, he said: "The writer's initiative, the fighting spirit towards life, and the independent thinking power seem to have been deprived by someone, not like a soul engineer." Who deprived it? He said: "The most important and fundamental reason is that the subjective idealism that violates Chairman Mao's thought dominates the leadership of our creation." Here, he seems to support Chairman Mao on the surface, but in reality, he is only similar to Hu Feng's vicious practice, "don't touch it literally, and follow it where possible," using the name of "Chairman Mao's thought" to slander, attack, and completely deny the Party's leadership in literature and art. In this speech, he even said this kind of words that slander our new society and slander our Party's leadership in literature and art: "To admit that writers are soul engineers, we must respect the writers' right and freedom to create. We do not have actual formal control, but ideological control." Isn't this singing the same tune as Hu Feng's efforts to exaggerate the shortcomings in our literary and artistic work, even to the point of fabricating facts, in order to attack the Party? Isn't this also similar in wording to the imperialist elements' slander that we have no freedom of thought and freedom of creation?
    The similarities between Feng Xuefeng's literary thoughts and Hu Feng are not limited to these. For example, his views on popularization and improvement, and his views on the standards of literary criticism, are directly opposed to Comrade Mao Zedong's speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, and are consistent with Hu Feng. I am not saying that Comrade Feng Xuefeng is exactly the same as Hu Feng. I am just saying that in literary thought, on many basic and important issues of literature and art, and on exaggerating the shortcomings of progressive literature and art in the past to attack progressive literary and art circles and exaggerating the shortcomings of today's people's literature and art to attack the Party, Comrade Feng Xuefeng is really too consistent with Hu Feng. It is difficult for us to explain these facts without regarding their literary activities as representing a bourgeois line, a revisionist line, an anti-Party and anti-Marxist line, hidden within the revolutionary literary movement.
    Comrade Feng Xuefeng is a very important figure in the Ding and Chen anti-Party group. He is the person in this group who has a series of literary views. Comrade Ding Ling herself said that when she wanted to estimate the situation, she would ask Feng Xuefeng for advice. What kind of secret anti-Party activities did they jointly discuss and carry out? They should thoroughly explain to the Party.
    From Comrade Feng Xuefeng's papers and essays, in addition to the bourgeois literary thoughts mentioned above, we can also see some decadent bourgeois thoughts, promoting individualism, idealism, and some other reactionary ideas that are surprising.
    First of all, it is his slander against the Chinese nation and the Chinese people. In "On Lu Xun" (see "The Era That Has Passed"), he said, "Our nation, that is, the ancient nation that everyone praises, has originally embarked on the same process of extinction as some ancient nations that have already become extinct." He one-sidedly exaggerated the negative influence of our country's autocratic politics and imperialist oppression on the Chinese people, and believed that "the human quality of the Chinese nation" has become very "morbid." He said, "There used to be an American missionary who lived in China for many years and listed more than twenty characteristics of the Chinese people, and most of them were bad. But I think that is still superficial, not the most profound observation." Look, he thinks that the imperialist elements' slander against us is not enough! In "Waste and Mold" (see "Advancing Without Retreating"), he even attributed Wang Jingwei's surrender to the enemy and even "moldy death" to the Chinese nation and the Chinese people. He said: "Such mold is of course the inevitable trend of this kind of substance, but it also needs the rotten and decaying side of the nation and people's indifference and sympathy for it to mold. Only then can it gradually and fully take advantage of the trend to mold to such an end. Otherwise, if we do not let them have the possibility of surrendering to the enemy and do not watch them develop so naturally, then this period of history can naturally present another form, and it can be passed without their mold." In "Cruel or Numb" (see "Crossing the Days"), he believes that the "numbness" of the reactionary ruling class "naturally also reflects the reaction of the people's numbness," and he believes that the people are "numbly suppressed and killed" by the reactionary rulers' cruel oppression and massacre, "the people have almost lost the feeling of pain." This is the result of Comrade Feng Xuefeng's observation of things from the "supra-class" viewpoint of the bourgeoisie. He does not know that what is bound to perish, and therefore is corrupt, ugly, and unbearable in the process of perishing, is only the past reactionary ruling class of China, not the entire Chinese nation! He does not know that Wang Jingwei's surrender to the enemy and "moldy death" is not determined by the Chinese people, but by the class nature of the pro-Japanese faction of the big bourgeoisie! He does not know that the result of the reactionary ruling class's cruel oppression and massacre is precisely the people's resistance, not the so-called "numbness" or "obedience" that this intellectual who considers himself to be above the people fantasizes and fabricates (another essay in "Crossing the Days" entitled "Kindness" talks about the people's "taming" and "obedience")! This kind of slander of Comrade Feng Xuefeng against the Chinese nation and the Chinese people easily reminds people of Hu Feng's notorious saying of "the trauma of spiritual slavery." Their views are indeed very similar in losing confidence in the Chinese nation and obliterating the revolutionary nature of the Chinese people.
    Comrade Feng Xuefeng wrote an article "On Friendship" (see "Advancing Without Retreating"), which is a reactionary article that concentrates on openly promoting bourgeois idealism, individualism, and even openly advocating "loyalty" to revolutionary traitors. In that article, he puts the friendship between private individuals and the organizational relationship of collective classes on an equal footing, and in fact, he thinks that the former is more fundamental and puts it above the latter. He does not regard the friendship between friends, the organizational relationship of collective classes, and comradeship as being determined by people's social status, class relations, and class interests, but thinks that they originate from the abstract instinct of people's demand or pursuit of "human love." The most noteworthy thing is this passage: He said, "For example, two friends or comrades, one has the attempt to betray or destroy the nation or society, or the class, or the group to which they belong (this is to say that this betrayal or destruction is not a good revolutionary behavior)," "If you do not first advise and stop your friends or comrades, but only report his attempt to the society or group as if it were intelligence, this may be said to be loyal to the society or group, but it is insidious and close to terrible for friends or comrades, and here, loyalty to the society or group is inseparable from loyalty to friends or comrades, so that the seeming loyalty to the society or group is often doubtful." As the comrades revealed at the meeting, Comrade Feng Xuefeng often likes to be with revolutionary traitors, very close, not disgusted or vigilant at all. It turns out that he has this theory of being loyal to "friends" who are traitors as the guide for his actions.
    Some of Comrade Feng Xuefeng's essays also reveal pessimistic and gloomy emotions. These essays were written after he came out of the Shangrao concentration camp. Why did he have pessimistic and gloomy emotions after being released from prison, returning to being able to contact the Party, and having various revolutionary work to do? This is worthy of study. His gloomy emotions are sometimes manifested as a crazy desire for destruction. When the Soviet Red Army attacked Berlin, the British and American imperialist news agencies issued some dispatches. These dispatches were deliberately designed to specifically describe and exaggerate the destruction in the war, saying that "every house, every window, every top floor was spraying fire," "the whole city was shrouded in flames," "the former magnificent buildings have now become countless broken bricks and rubble; the trees on both sides are like fire dragons. Berlin is now a city of the dead, with corpses lying across the streets and alleys, or locked in the dark tunnels of the subway network, or floating in the ditches. The whole city is on fire, burning fiercely, and continuing to spread. ... At night, except for the blazing fire and a cold moon, it is extremely dark and desolate." Comrade Feng Xuefeng could not distinguish the ulterior motives of these dispatches, but greatly appreciated them, copied and quoted them, and wrote an article "Fire Prison" (see "Advancing Without Retreating" and "Essay Collection" Volume 1). He praised these dispatches as "all epic-like texts." He said, "Such burning is worthy of our revelry." He said, "There is no more such burning, such a sea of fire, that is more humane." But he also said, "After our revelry, we may still have to endure the unbearable bleakness and茫然 pain." His conclusion is this: "Burning cannot be stopped immediately, the fire will continue to burn." Comrade Feng Xuefeng's feelings are really extraordinary. What he is reveling in is not the final collapse of German fascism and the liberation of the people of Berlin, but the city-wide fire, corpses lying across the streets, and darkness and desolation described and exaggerated by the British and American imperialist communications. Some comrades also revealed at the meeting Comrade Feng Xuefeng's extremely dark psychology and his crazy desire for destruction. During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, he said that he was waiting to be arrested. After the Hungarian incident, he said that there was no hope for mankind. When the rightists attacked the Party this time, he shouted "Report grievances and take revenge!" He shouted "The flood has reached the gate!" Why does a Communist Party member, and a veteran Party member of thirty years, have such peculiar psychology and feelings? Why does Comrade Feng Xuefeng hate the Party so much? This is also something that Comrade Feng Xuefeng himself can deeply understand and thoroughly explain.
    In our opinion, this may also be a kind of abnormal expression of despair when the ambitions of a personal careerist cannot be realized. Comrade Feng Xuefeng has a great desire for power. In the past, when he was sent from northern Shaanxi to Shanghai, he put himself above the Party, regarded himself as an imperial envoy, and arbitrarily refused to recognize the organization of the local Party and the party membership of many underground Party members according to his personal will. When he was in charge of a publishing house, he was so tyrannical that he was like a tyrant, who could insult cadres at will and drive them away at will. When his personal desires cannot be realized, he falls into pessimistic and gloomy emotions. He feels "still empty" (see "Rural Style and Urban Style"). He demands private friendship, and even needs the friendship of those who intend to be traitors and those who have already become traitors. He has no confidence in the nation, the people, or even mankind. When he feels that what is hindering the realization of his personal ambitions and desires is not other forces, but the revolutionary collective, but the Party, he also hates the Party, trying to break its constraints and destroy it with his personal strength.
    I have not read all of Comrade Feng Xuefeng's articles. This is just a few materials hastily put forward based on my memory and temporary browsing. This still needs in-depth analysis by the comrades. Of course, I also hope that he will not give up this opportunity for the Party to save him and educate him, and honestly and thoroughly explain and examine his own mistakes.

专栏：

    冯雪峰的反党反马克思主义的文艺思想和社会思想
    （何其芳　8月16日在作家协会党组扩大会议上的发言）
    在最近几次会上，听了许多同志对于冯雪峰同志的反党言行的揭发，特别是夏衍同志的揭发，我和会上的很多同志一样，是很激动，很愤慨的。原来三十年来混在党内的冯雪峰是这样一个反党分子，这样一个个人野心家！为了达到他个人的目的，他不惜完全破坏党的组织原则。他可以抛开上海的党组织，依靠胡风那样一些人去进行分裂当时上海左翼文艺界的活动。他可以因为党的负责同志批评了他几句，就擅自脱离党，一个人跑回家乡去。在这次整风运动开始后，他更在自己领导的出版社内点火，号召右派分子和对党不满分子“有冤报冤，有仇报仇”，鼓动他们向党进攻。他宣称“洪水已经冲到大门了！”这是他对右派分子的进攻的欢呼！
      我过去和冯雪峰接触很少，了解不多，只是曾浏览过他一部分论文和杂文。现在凭记忆所及，想从这些论文和杂文中也提出一些材料，来看看他二十多年来到底宣传的是怎样的文艺理论，怎样的一些反马克思主义的思想。和其他反党分子和个人野心家一样，他是不会把他的反党的心思和活动都形之笔墨的。但和同志们揭发的他的言行放在一起来看，这些材料也是有助于我们了解冯雪峰的面目的。
    1945年和1946年我在重庆工作的时候，曾有一个地下党员告诉我，在文艺界的群众的眼里，雪峰是胡风派。这个同志不知道雪峰也是一个党员。但我当时听了却是很痛心的。为什么我们的党员，而且是冯雪峰同志这样一个从事文艺工作历史很长久的老党员，不忠实地执行党的文艺路线，反而在群众眼里成了胡风派呢？后来在一次文艺界的集会上，冯雪峰同志公开宣称当时蒋区的文艺界是一片沙漠，其中只长了几根绿草，那就是“七月诗丛”。他就是这样和胡风一致，完全否定了当时蒋区的进步文艺，只赞扬胡风所编的“七月诗丛”。那时党已经在重庆召开了几次文艺座谈会，有一些党和非党的作家参加。在这个座谈会上，已经批评了胡风派的理论和作品。对于冯雪峰同志，党是争取他教育他接受党的文艺路线的。然而他太自以为了不起了。他没有把党的文艺路线放在眼里。胡风在座谈会上发言，反对毛泽东同志在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话中关于政治标准和艺术标准的提法，雪峰后来就写文章来公开响应。那就是他以“画室”的笔名发表在1946年1月的新华日报副刊上的“题外的话”。他讥笑“政治性”“艺术性”的说法经不起“一连反问三次”。他说，“研究或评价具体作品，用什么抽象的‘政治性’、‘艺术性’的代数学式的说法，可说是什么都弄糟了。”发表这篇文章是为了引起讨论的。所以我们也写文章批评了他。这个期间他还写了一篇长的论文，叫作“论民主革命的文艺运动”。这篇文章更极力为胡风的反动文艺理论辩护。我们在座谈会上批评了胡风所提倡的所谓“主观战斗精神”。雪峰在这篇文章里就为它辩护说：“这些情形，主要的应看作对于革命的接近和追求，而反映到文艺和文艺运动的要求上来是非常好的，也正为我们文艺所希望的。”他就是这样美化胡风的反动理论，这样为它喝采！他甚至说：“我们先不能以为这是借了批判教条主义的机会，来试行注射唯心论毒素的企图，因为在今天没有这样的可能，同时是分明地在对革命抱着精神上的追求之下提出问题的。”你看，他为胡风辩护达到了何等武断的地步！胡风派的“主观”论明明是彻头彻尾地宣扬资产阶级的唯心主义，他却硬说他们主观上没有那种“企图”，甚至客观上也没有那种“可能”。那是1946年。那还是在蒋介石统治的地区。你看，那时候那地方就已经没有宣传唯心主义的“可能”了，岂不是唯心主义早就绝种了吗？我们今天还反对唯心主义干什么？我们在座谈会上还批评了在胡风的理论的指导之下产生的作品，路翎的作品。雪峰在这篇文章里也为它们辩护。他说，
  “这正是我们所要求，并且也正是几年来我们文艺上的一个大展开”。他又说，“据我读后的感觉，其中反映着作者自己的热情和理想的追求的部分，就特别觉得真实，壮旺和亲切，并且支配着作品的全体”。即使还有缺点，“至多只能说是年龄、思想、社会生活经历等等的限制，绝不是由于什么不能发展的倾向所遗误”。你看，他是多么欣赏胡风派的作品，多么煞费苦心为胡风的反动理论开脱！一个理论家，居然可以不顾事实和理论到了这样的地步，还自以为是一个马克思主义者，这不是太奇怪了吗？
    群众的眼睛是明亮的。他们把雪峰看成胡风派，是符合实际的。尽管在左联时期，胡风是依附雪峰的，到了这个时候，雪峰所演的脚色却不过是胡风的一个附和者和辩护者了。
    后来我浏览了一些冯雪峰同志的其他的论文和杂文，我才知道，这完全不是偶然的。在许多文艺的基本问题和重要问题上，胡风和雪峰的论点是一致的。我们简直分不清是谁影响了谁。这是左翼文艺运动以来一条隐蔽在马克思主义的外衣之下的资产阶级的文艺路线，修正主义的文艺路线。他们是企图从内部来夺取我们的革命文艺运动的堡垒的。许多研究新文学史的人，只知道左翼文艺运动曾经有过教条主义的错误，不知道长时期以来还存在着这样一条反党反马克思主义的文艺路线。批判胡风的时候，我们已经接触到这个问题。现在再来看看冯雪峰的文艺思想，这条路线就更加清楚了。
    和胡风相同，冯雪峰同志是不赞成强调世界观的作用的。1936年，他以“吕克玉”的笔名发表在“作家”月刊上的“对于文学运动几个问题的意见”中，就提出了这样的论点，认为强调正确的世界观就是“机械论的老调”。他又说：“作家和一个人一样，读社会科学书固然是重要的补助，但主要的应当在他的生活上，在他对于历史的和当时事象的关心和分析上，在他对于例如莎士比亚或巴尔札克的作品（两人生平都来不及读到马、恩二人的著作）的研究上，在他对于题材上的摄取上，在他写作的过程上去获得‘正确的世界观’”。他这种对于作家如何获得正确的世界观的看法也是有问题的。他把学习马克思列宁主义降低为仅仅是一种“补助”。他认为从作家本来的生活中，甚至于从他的研究文学作品和写作过程中，就可以获得正确的世界观。这和胡风认为从创作实践和文化工作就可以改造思想的论调也是很相似的。获得正确的世界观当然不能仅仅依靠读马克思列宁主义的著作，但学习理论的重要绝不止是一种“补助”。获得正确的世界观当然要依靠我们的实践，但这种实践如毛泽东同志所指出的，主要应该是参加工农兵群众斗争，而不仅仅是作家本来的生活和他的艺术实践。承认正确的世界观的重要与否，承认思想改造的必要与否，这是我们和胡风的根本性的争论之一，也即是我们和资产阶级的修正主义的文艺路线的根本性的分歧之一。在这个问题上冯雪峰同志不但在过去有过和胡风相同或相似的论调，就是在解放以后，在某些会议的发言中，他仍然保持着这种轻视世界观的作用、轻视理论学习的看法。
    和胡风相同，冯雪峰同志是否定民族形式、否定旧形式的利用的。1940年，他写过一篇题为“民族性与民族形式”的文章（后来收入论文集“过来的时代”）。在这篇文章里，他说“民族形式必然而且必须在世界化着国际化着”，“‘民族性’问题在文化上是失去了独立的意义的”，“文化的‘民族性’正是处在被扬弃的过程上”。这和马克思列宁主义对于民族文化、民族形式的看法是直接违反的。大约是1945年，他又写过一篇“论艺术力及其他”（见杂文集“有进无退”）。他在这篇文章里说旧形式“可利用的有效的是非常的少”，民间文艺里面“有很多有毒的反动的要素和过于落后的东西，只有极少的要素才能和民众在生活上求进步的要求相联结着”，“旧的章回小说却可说是没有东西可以利用”。他把利用旧形式看作是“迎合小市民”的“市侩主义”的表现。这和胡风的“论民族形式问题”中的那些否定旧形式否定民间文艺的话太相像了。承认民族形式的重要与否，承认继承本国的文学遗产（包括民间文艺）的必要与否，这也是我们和胡风的重要争论之一。在这个问题上，冯雪峰同志也是和胡风一致，而反对党的文艺方针的。
    和胡风相同，冯雪峰同志在抗日战争中是抹煞蒋管区的进步文艺的成就，而在解放以后又否定新中国的人民文艺的发展的。大家都知道，胡风有两把板斧，一把叫作反对“主观公式主义”，一把叫反对“客观主义”。他用这两把板斧来砍杀抗日战争中的整个蒋管区的进步文艺。他认为它们都是反现实主义的东西。冯雪峰同志在“论艺术力及其他”里面完全采用了这种胡风制造的武器，同样勇敢地对当时的进步作家一律加以讨伐。就是在党已经开始对胡风的文艺思想进行批评以后，冯雪峰同志所写的“论民主革命的文艺运动”，仍然继续在那里把许多进步作家的作品诅咒为“公式主义”和“客观主义”。解放以后，冯雪峰同志有一个时候曾表示要和胡风的文艺思想告别，因此在某些公开发表的文章里面也未尝不可以找到一二句肯定新的人民文艺的话。然而他的肯定也常常带着很大的保留。比如在“中国文学中从古典现实主义到无产阶级现实主义的发展的一个轮廓”中，他虽然不得不肯定新的人民文艺在内容和形式上都有新的东西，但接着又说，“在反映现实上，还普遍地存在着主观性、片面性和表面性的缺点和错误”，“艺术水平还低下”。这就是他对新的人民文艺从作品内容到艺术水平都一概贬低。至于他的不曾公开发表的会议上的发言，那对我们今天的文艺就鄙视和贬低得非常厉害了。比如1953年他在全国文协组织的学习社会主义现实主义座谈会上的发言，就说我们“今天刊物上发表的作品，与高中、初中的作文差不了好多”。特别使人感到奇怪的，在这点上他也和胡风相同：在抗日战争中的蒋管区，他把进步文艺的缺点完全归罪于作家，好像这些缺点和国民党反动派的压迫毫无关系；但到了解放以后的新中国，他却又把文艺的缺点都归罪于领导，好像作家们忽然又什么责任都没有了。就在上面提到的那次座谈会上的发言中，他就这样说：“作家的能动性，向生活的战斗性，独立的思考力，好像是被谁剥夺了的样子，不像一个灵魂工程师。”到底是被谁剥夺了呢？他说：“最主要最根本的原因是违反毛主席思想的主观主义思想支配了我们的创作的领导。”他在这里表面上好像拥护毛主席，实际上却不过也和胡风的恶毒的作法相似，“字面上不要去碰它，可能的地方还要顺着它”，假借“毛主席思想”之名来污蔑、攻击和全部否定党对于文艺的领导而已。在这个发言中他甚至说出了这种污蔑我们新社会、污蔑我们党对于文艺的领导的话：“承认作家是灵魂工程师，就要尊重作家创作的权利和自由。我们没有实际上的形式上的管制，而是思想上的管制。”这和胡风极力夸大我们文艺工作中的缺点，甚至不惜捏造事实，这样来向党进攻，不是唱的一个调子吗？这和帝国主义分子污蔑我们没有思想自由，创作自由，不也是连词句都相似吗？
    冯雪峰的文艺思想和胡风相同之处还不止这样一些。比如他对于普及与提高的看法，对于文艺批评的标准的看法，都是直接反对毛泽东同志在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话，而和胡风一致的。我并不是说冯雪峰同志完全和胡风一样。我只是说在文艺思想上，在许多文艺的基本问题和重要问题上，在夸大过去的进步文艺的缺点来打击进步文艺界和夸大今天的人民文艺的缺点来向党进攻上，冯雪峰同志和胡风实在太一致了。不把他们的文艺活动看作是代表着一条隐藏在革命文艺运动内部的资产阶级的路线，修正主义的路线，反党反马克思主义的路线，我们是很难解释这些事实的。
    在丁、陈反党集团中，冯雪峰同志是一个很重要的人物。他是这个集团中有一系列的文艺见解的人。丁玲同志自己说过，她要对形势作估计的时候，就向冯雪峰请教。他们之间到底曾经共同商量过和进行过一些什么秘密的反党活动，他们都应该彻底地向党交代。
    从冯雪峰同志的论文和杂文中，除了上面所说的那些资产阶级文艺思想而外，还可以看到一些腐朽的资产阶级的思想，宣扬个人主义、唯心主义以及其他某些使人吃惊的反动思想。
    首先是他对于中国民族和中国人民的污蔑。在“鲁迅论”（见“过来的时代”）里面，他说，“我们的民族，即大家所夸耀的古民族，本来已走上和有些已经灭亡的古民族一样的灭亡的过程上”。他片面地夸大我国的专制政治和帝国主义的压迫对于中国人民的消极的影响，认为“中国民族的人的素质”已经变得十分“病态”。他说，“从前有一个美国传教师，他在中国住了多年，曾列举出了中国人的特性二十多种，而大半是坏的。但我觉得那还是表面的，不是最深刻的观察。”你看，他认为帝国主义分子对我们的污蔑还污蔑得不够！在“废与霉”（见“有进无退”）里面，他甚至把汪精卫的投敌以至于“霉死”也要归咎于中国民族和中国人民。他说：“这样的霉，固然是这类物质的必然趋势，但还须有民族的可烂可朽的一面和人们无关心与同情给它去霉，这才使它能够渐渐地、尽致地乘着趋势霉到这样的尽头。否则，如果我们不让他们有投敌的可能，不这么坦然地看着他们那么自自然然的发展，则这一段历史自然可以呈另一种形态，无需他们的霉烂也可以度过的吧。”在“残酷或麻木”（见“跨的日子”）里面，他认为反动统治阶级的“麻木”“自然也反应着人民之麻木的反应”，他认为人民对于反动统治者的残酷的压迫和屠杀是“麻木地被压和被杀”，“人民几乎已失去痛苦的感觉”。这是冯雪峰同志用资产阶级的“超阶级”的观点来观察事物的结果。他不知道必然归于灭亡，因而在走向灭亡的过程中腐败丑恶不堪的，仅仅是中国过去的反动统治阶级，并不是整个中国民族！他不知道汪精卫的投敌以至“霉死”，并不决定于中国人民，而是决定于大资产阶级亲日派的阶级本性！他不知道反动统治阶级残酷的压迫和屠杀的结果正是人民的反抗，而并不是他这种自以为高居人民之上的知识分子所幻想和捏造的什么“麻木”或者“顺从”（“跨的日子”中另一题为“善良”的杂文，就讲到人民的“驯服”，“顺从”）！冯雪峰同志的这一类对于中国民族和中国人民的污蔑，很容易使人想起胡风的臭名昭著的“精神奴役的创伤”说来。在对于中国民族丧失信心和抹杀中国人民的革命性上，他们的看法的确也是很相似的。
    冯雪峰同志写过一篇“论友爱”（见“有进无退”），那是一篇集中地露骨地宣传资产阶级的唯心主义、个人主义以至公开鼓吹对革命叛徒也要“忠诚”的反动文章。在那篇文章里，他把私人之间的友谊和集体的阶级的组织关系摆在同等地位，而且实际是认为前者更根本，把它摆在后者之上。他把朋友之间的友谊、集体的阶级的组织关系和同志爱不是看成决定于人们的社会地位、阶级关系和阶级利益，而认为它们是来源于抽象的本能的人对于“人类爱”的要求或追求。其中最值得注意的是这样一段：他说，“例如两个朋友或同志，有一个对于民族或社会，或阶级，或他们所属的集团有叛逆或破坏的企图（这是说这叛逆或破坏并非好的革命的行为）”，“假如不先对朋友或同志下劝告和阻止，却只将他的企图当作情报似的东西向社会或团体告发，这对于社会或团体也许可说是忠诚的，但对于朋友或同志却是居心险恶，近于可怕，而且在这里，对社会或团体的忠诚是和对朋友或同志的忠诚分不开的，所以那对社会或团体的形似的忠实也常是可疑的”。如同志们在会上所揭露的，冯雪峰同志常常喜欢和革命叛徒在一起，亲密得很，一点不厌恶，也不警惕，原来他是有这种对叛徒“朋友”也必须忠诚的理论为他的行动的指导的。
    冯雪峰同志的有些杂文还流露出悲观的阴暗的情绪。这些杂文都是写在他从上饶集中营出来以后。为什么出狱以后，回到可以和党联系并且有种种革命工作可以做以后，反而有了悲观的阴暗的情绪，这是值得研究的。他的这种阴暗情绪有时又表现为一种疯狂的对于破坏的渴望。苏联红军攻入柏林的时候，英美帝国主义通讯社发出了一些电讯。这些电讯别有用心地专门描写和夸大战争中的破坏，说“每一幢房屋，每一个窗户，每一个顶楼都喷着火光”，“全城笼罩在烈焰中”，“从前的壮丽建筑，现在已成为无数的断砖残瓦；两旁树木，好像火龙一般。柏林现在是死人城，尸体纵横，满布于街头小巷中，或被封闭在地下铁道网的黑暗隧道里，或浮沉于沟渠中。全城大火，猛烈焚烧，继续蔓延。……夜间则除熊熊火光和一片冷月外，都极黑暗凄凉”。冯雪峰同志不能辨别这些电讯的别有用心，反而大为欣赏，把它们抄引下来，写了一篇“火狱”（见“有进无退”和“论文集”第一卷）。他称赞这些电讯“都是史诗似的文字”。他说“这样的焚毁就值得我们的狂欢”。他说“再也没有这样的焚毁，这样的火海，更为人道的了”。但是他又说“我们在狂欢之后，也许还要忍受不能忍受的索漠的茫然的痛苦”。他的结语是这样的：“焚毁不能立即停止，大火还要延烧着吧。”冯雪峰同志的这种感情实在是异乎常人的。他狂欢的不是德国法西斯的最后崩溃和柏林人民的解放，而是英美帝国主义通讯所描写和夸大的全城大火、尸体纵横和黑暗凄凉。有些同志在会上也揭发了冯雪峰同志的极其阴暗的心理和他的疯狂的对于破坏的渴望。肃反的时候，他说他等待着被逮捕。匈牙利事件发生后，他说人类没有希望了。这次右派分子向党进攻的时候，他高呼“有冤报冤，有仇报仇！”他高呼“洪水已经冲到了大门！”一个共产党员，而且是一个三十年的老党员，为什么有这样奇特的心理和感情呢？冯雪峰同志对于党为什么这样仇恨呢？这也是要冯雪峰同志自己才能深切的了解和彻底的交代的。
    在我们想来，这或许也是个人野心家的野心不能得到实现时候的一种变态的绝望的表现吧。冯雪峰同志是有很大的权力欲望的。过去从陕北被派到上海去的时候，他把个人驾乎党之上，以钦差大臣自居，凭他个人的意思随便不承认地方党的组织和许多地下党员的党籍。他负责一个出版社的时候，横蛮到像一个暴君，可以随便辱骂干部，随便赶干部走。当他的个人欲望不能实现的时候，他又坠入悲观的阴暗的情绪里。他感到“依然是空虚”（见“乡风与市风”）。他要求着私人的友谊，甚至连打算作叛徒和已经作叛徒的那样的人的友谊也需要。他对于民族、人民以至人类都没有信心。等到他感到阻碍他的个人野心个人欲望实现的不是别的力量，而是革命的集体，而是党的时候，他就对党也抱着仇恨，妄图用个人的力量来打破它的约束，来破坏它了。
    冯雪峰同志的文章我没有全读。这仅仅是就记忆所及，临时翻阅了一下，匆促提出的一些材料。这还有待于同志们的深入的分析。当然，也希望他不要放弃这次党挽救他教育他的机会，老实地彻底地交代和检查他自己的错误。
