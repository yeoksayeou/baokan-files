    Zhang Zeduo Only Has a Reactionary Side
    The Jilin People's Congress Exposes His Pretenses of Progress

    (Our Dispatch) Zhang Zeduo, the vice chairman of the Changchun City Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association and a rightist, who boasted that he had always been progressive and had no two-facedness, was completely exposed at the sixth meeting of the First People's Congress of Jilin Province. It turned out that he was not consistently progressive, but had consistently played two-faced tricks, pretending to be a progressive, reactionary fellow. One year, the task of selling public bonds in the industrial and commercial circles was not completed, and he summoned the chairmen of the industrial and commercial federations of various districts in Changchun City, severely criticized them, and said that they should quickly complete the task. However, after the meeting, he secretly told industrialists and merchants not to subscribe, saying that there would be reductions and exemptions soon. He once told others that he had "three hates." First, he hated the land reform for being too cruel in the struggle against landlords; second, he hated the suppression of counter-revolutionaries for being too ruthless against counter-revolutionary elements; and third, he hated the "suppression of counterrevolutionaries" campaign for fabricating things out of nothing. He attacked the current personnel system as being even more severe than the ten-household mutual responsibility system of Shang Yang's reforms. He hated the Party, comparing it to a "wolf" in sheep's clothing. He also compared industrialists and merchants to "pigs." He said that transformation was just fattening up the "pigs" for slaughter in the end. During the period of the Great Blooming and Contending, Zhang Zeduo's reactionary face became even more exposed. He once echoed and responded to Zhang Naiqi in the industrial and commercial circles of Jilin Province. Zhang Naiqi said that fixed interest was not exploitation, while Zhang Zeduo said that if fixed interest was exploitation, then the interest that workers earned from depositing their wages in the bank was also exploitation. He believed that the two-sidedness of the bourgeoisie was not subjective, but was forcibly imposed by the working class.

    张泽多只有反动的一面性
    吉林人代会上戳穿了他进步的伪装
    本报讯　吹嘘自己一贯进步和没有什么两面性的民建长春市副主任委员，右派分子张泽多，在吉林省第一届人民代表大会第六次会议上完全被揭穿了。原来他并不是一贯进步，而是一贯玩弄两面手法，伪装进步的，反动的家伙。有一年工商界推销公债，没有完成任务，他把长春市各区工商联主委找去，严厉批评了一通，说要赶快完成任务。但是在会后却暗中告诉工商户不要认购，说是很快就要减免了。他曾对别人也说过：他有“三恨”。一恨土改对地主斗争太残忍；二恨镇反中对反革命分子太狠毒；三恨肃反无中生有。他攻击现在的人事制度比商鞅变法的十家连座还厉害。他仇恨党，把党比成披着羊皮的“狼”。他还把工商业者比成“猪”。他说，改造就是把“猪”喂肥了，最后挨一刀。大鸣大放期间，张泽多的反动面目更加暴露了，他曾经在吉林省工商界与章乃器一唱一和互相呼应，章乃器说定息不是剥削，张泽多则说如果定息是剥削，那么工人把工资存入银行所得的利息也是剥削。他认为资产阶级两面性不是主观存在的，而是工人阶级硬给扣上的。
