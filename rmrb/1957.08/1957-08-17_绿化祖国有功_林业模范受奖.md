Xinhua News Agency, August 14th: One hundred and forty-eight model units and forty-four model individuals who have achieved remarkable results in greening the motherland and in forestry production nationwide will be awarded certificates, banners, medals, bonuses, and other items by the Ministry of Forestry in August.

These advanced production units and model individuals were evaluated by each province and region from the bottom up and were approved by the Ministry of Forestry after a final evaluation and review recently.

Among the counties rated as forestry model units are Qinglong County and Fuping County in Hebei Province, Yushe County in Shanxi Province, Linjiang County, Fuyu County, Changbai County, and Dongfeng County in Jilin Province, Huanglong County in Shaanxi Province, and some cooperatives in various provinces. For example, Qinglong County in Hebei Province has afforested more than 370,000 mu, closed hillsides for afforestation of more than 500,000 mu, and planted more than 1 million fruit trees in recent years, achieving remarkable results. Last year, this county increased its income by more than 510,000 yuan from timber forests, mountain products, medicinal materials, and mountain apricots alone, which is equivalent to the harvest from 29,000 mu of farmland. Since 1947, Yushe County in Shanxi Province has afforested more than 188,000 mu, closed hillsides for afforestation of more than 100,000 mu, and greened more than 600 li of roads. Due to afforestation and forest cultivation controlling soil erosion, 55,000 mu of farmland have been restored in recent years, and the grain yield per mu has increased from 80 jin to 200 jin. Every year, timber worth 270,000 yuan can be harvested from the forest land. Fuyu County in Jilin Province is an area severely affected by wind and sand disasters. Since 1950, it has built more than 150,000 mu of shelter forests, which has greatly reduced the wind and sand disasters to farmland. At the same time, it has also increased 120,000 mu of cultivated land, which has played a significant role in promoting the construction of shelter forests in western Northeast China. Linjiang County and Changbai County in Jilin Province have made great achievements in forest protection work and have never had a mountain fire in five or six years. In addition, forestry model units also include nurseries in Changzhi, Shanxi, Nanjing, Fujian, Lin'an, Zhejiang, Zhaowuda League in Inner Mongolia, as well as management offices, forestry work stations, etc.

Among the individuals rated as forestry models are Shi Yudian, a famous fruit tree grafting expert in Henan Province; Zhang Fenglin and Gao Jincai, who spent 18 years transforming Daquan Mountain in Yanggao County, Shanxi Province, and created typical experiences in soil and water conservation; Kuang Jingrong, who led the masses to green their hometown after liberation and was elected as a representative to the National People's Congress; Ao Mendai Lai (Mongolian), who led the masses to build 14 small forest belts, enthusiastically imparted technology, and cultivated four afforestation models; and Ge Wancai (Oroqen), who led the masses to persist in fighting fire for 15 days and finally extinguished the mountain fire.

In addition, a certain unit of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps was also rated as a model unit this time for its remarkable achievements in constructing farmland shelter forests in the past four years.

    绿化祖国有功
    林业模范受奖
    新华社14日讯  全国在绿化祖国和在林业生产中获得显著成绩的一百四十八个模范单位和四十四个模范人物，将在8月份内分别获得林业部授予的奖状、锦旗、奖章、奖金等物品。
    这些先进生产单位和模范个人，是各省、区由下而上评比出来的，又由林业部在最近作了最后的评比和审查之后批准的。
    被评为林业模范单位的，有河北省青龙县、阜平县，山西省榆社县，吉林省临江县、扶余县、长白县、东丰县，陕西省黄龙县等八个县和各省的一些合作社。其中如河北省青龙县几年来共造林三十七万多亩，封山育林五十多万亩，栽果树一百多万株，成绩显著。去年这个县仅木材林、山货、药材、山杏四项就增加五十一万多元的收入，等于二万九千亩农田的收成。山西榆社县自1947年以来，共造林十八万八千多亩，封山育林十万余亩，绿化了六百余里的道路。由于造林、育林控制水土流失，几年来恢复了农田五万五千亩，每亩粮食产量从八十斤提高到二百斤，每年还可以从林地里间采伐价值二十七万元的木材。吉林省扶余县是风沙灾害严重的地区，自1950年以来由于营造了十五万余亩防护林，因而大大减轻了农田的风沙灾害，同时还增加了十二万亩耕地，对营造东北西部防护林也起了很大的带动作用。吉林省临江县、长白县在护林工作上做出很大成绩，五、六年之内从未发生过山林火灾。此外，林业模范单位还包括山西长治、福建南靖、浙江临安、内蒙古昭乌达盟等地的苗圃，以及经营所、林业工作站等。
    被评为林业模范的人物中，有河南省著名的果树嫁接能手石玉殿，用十八年时间改造山西省阳高县大泉山、创造了水土保持典型经验的张风林和高进才，解放后带动群众绿化家乡、并当选为全国人民代表大会的代表旷经荣，带动群众造小型林带十四条、热心传授技术、培养了四名造林模范的敖门代来（蒙古族），领导群众坚持打火十五天、终于扑灭山火的戈万才（鄂伦春族）。
    此外，新疆生产建设兵团某部四年来因营造农田防护林成绩显著，这次也被评为模范单位。
