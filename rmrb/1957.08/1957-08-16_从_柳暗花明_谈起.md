Starting from "A glimmer of light"
Ji Huaimin

Li Jinghan often liked to use the phrases "at the end of one's rope" and "a glimmer of light" to describe his life and experiences. Indeed, these two phrases can describe his life and experiences, but we have fundamentally different understandings of the meaning of these two phrases. The era of so-called "a glimmer of light" for rightist Li Jinghan spanned a long period. This scholar, who is supposedly "approaching his twilight years" at the age of sixty-two, spent half a century in this so-called "a glimmer of light" era. From 1917 to 1922, during the five years when China was in the midst of the revolutionary storms of the May Fourth Movement, the June Third Movement, and the New Culture Movement, Li Jinghan was hiding in his ideal "a glimmer of light," studying "sociology" and teaching Oriental languages at Pomona College in California, USA. From 1924 to 1948, during the twenty-four years when China underwent tremendous changes through three revolutionary stages: the Northern Expedition, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the Liberation War, Li Jinghan remained safely in his ideal "a glimmer of light" at a church university, training servants for imperialism and the ruling class. During this period, he was most proud of his time working on agricultural surveys for the United Nations, because in his mind, serving imperialism was not a cause for shame but a source of pride. As he himself said, it was "the most pleasant thing to do to make a meager contribution!"

Isn't it clear enough that the era of "a glimmer of light" for rightist Li Jinghan was precisely the era of "a glimmer of light" for the big landlords and big bourgeoisie? And in this era, all oppressed and exploited working people were truly in an era of "deep water and scorching fire," "at the end of their rope," and had to rise up in revolt!

In May 1957, during this month full of struggle, the storm of great airing of views and great blooming of ideas blew open the seemingly calm grass, and "monsters and demons" began to show their faces. This Li Jinghan, who was cloaked in the guise of a scholar, began to smile. His vicious and sinister heart began to daydream again. He thought that in this season when the red apricot blossoms were full of spring, an era of "a glimmer of light" was about to unfold before him. So, like reciting a hymn, he opened his throat and "sang the praises" of his era:

"I feel that living in this unprecedented great era, I increasingly believe that it is an extraordinary piece of good fortune in one's life. It is truly worth living, and living is truly meaningful. Therefore, I must struggle and strive to live on." (Renmin University School Newspaper, Issue 155) No matter how "beautiful" the rhetoric of this "hymn" by rightist Li Jinghan, it cannot conceal the ugliness in his heart. What does he want to "struggle" for? What does he want to "strive" for? He struggles to seize every opportunity in the era he considers to be "a glimmer of light," and uses the most vicious words and actions to curse and oppose the Communist Party and socialism.

Always Wearing Bourgeois "Colored Glasses"

Rightist Li Jinghan compared studying Marxism-Leninism to getting glasses, which is both true and false. The so-called truth is that Li Jinghan did indeed treat the study of Marxism-Leninism with a self-deceiving attitude, as if he were just getting glasses. The so-called falsehood is that he never really intended to put on these glasses. To this day, he still firmly wears his bourgeois colored glasses. Because those colored glasses have been worn for so long without being taken off, the earpieces have grown into the muscles of his ears, making it difficult to remove them even with surgery. He once said: "Due to the training of my profession, I have long believed in facts and in the truth that exists in ancient sayings such as 'seeing is believing.'" (See the interview with Li Jinghan published in the People's Daily on May 16th) Now, let's take a look at how he "hears" and "sees" what he calls "seeing is believing":

First, he hears: I studied sociology, but after liberation, some people called it "vulgar sociology."

He sees: What is "vulgar sociology"? Even I am baffled. (Study Magazine, 1957, Issue 11)

Rightist Li Jinghan only heard about vulgar sociology but did not see the reality of vulgar sociology, meaning: bourgeois sociology is neither reactionary nor vulgar. He ambitiously ran around and called for the "restoration of bourgeois sociology," and he shamelessly said: "The 'organization of a sociological society' should be grasped tightly, which is very beneficial for organizing and contacting researchers and selecting personnel. Once a year, hold a meeting to read papers and exchange knowledge... These are all very good. It is most appropriate to establish it in the Academy of Sciences. If a comprehensive university can offer courses and establish a department, we will strongly support it. If there is a survey and research office (institute) under mature conditions, we will also strive to participate." (Minutes of the Academy of Sciences Symposium on April 23rd) Li Jinghan's efforts to restore bourgeois vulgar sociology are no longer just "hearing" and "seeing," but action.

Second, he hears: The Communist Party wants to rectify its style of work and eliminate the three evils.

He sees: Between the Communist Party and intellectuals, "I don't think there is a wall or a ditch, but the Great Wall. Was the Great Wall built by both sides? I don't understand history. I don't think the Mongols built it; it was the Han Chinese who built it to block the Mongols. Whoever built it should tear it down. Everyone understands this principle. The one who tied the bell must untie it. ... As long as there is a party, the party and the masses cannot be completely frank and sincere on all issues." (Renmin University School Newspaper, Issue 152)

Rightist Li Jinghan heard that the Communist Party was rectifying its style of work and eliminating the three evils, and then he saw that the opportunity had arrived. So he made wild remarks, saying that the certain estrangement between the Party and the masses was like the Great Wall, and he incited people by saying that it was the Communist Party that built the Great Wall. As long as the Communist Party exists, the relationship between the Party and the masses cannot be normal. The implication is that the masses should rise up and overthrow the Communist Party. The viciousness of his intentions is evident.

Third, he hears: We should attach importance to cultivating new forces.

He sees: "I admire the spirit that 'Party members can do anything'... At that time, Party members believed that it didn't matter if they were not good enough, because they had a backstage boss and could invite Soviet experts. I believe that only four theoretical courses can be mastered by experts in a few months or even a few hours. ... An old dog bear can't perform new tricks. Even if an old dog bear is performing old tricks, these old tricks may be more unique than what a new dog bear who has only been around for a year or two can perform." (Renmin University School Newspaper, Issue 152)

Rightist Li Jinghan heard about cultivating new forces and was deeply disgusted. He scolded young teachers as new dog bears and even scolded old teachers, including himself, as old dog bears. He indirectly attacked and did his best to slander teachers of political theory courses, saying that these courses could turn people into experts in a few hours. He also sowed discord in Sino-Soviet relations and vilified Soviet experts. Li Jinghan's sharp,刻薄、and extremely reactionary remarks are absurd.

Rightist Li Jinghan's "seeing is believing" is not limited to this. There are even more reactionary remarks. For example, he seized on the analogy of Party members rectifying their style of work being like washing their faces and said viciously: "Today, the Party not only needs to wash the dust off its face, but needs to wash its face, and should even swallow soap to wash itself." (Renmin University School Newspaper, Issue 152) The meaning of this sentence is that the Communist Party not only has dirt on its face that needs to be washed, but also has a dirty heart that needs to be washed. What a vicious rightist! It is not the Communists who need to wash their hearts, but you, these insane rightists!

This is the truth of rightist Li Jinghan's "seeing is believing" under the reactionary bourgeois colored glasses.

Putting on Makeup is a Waste of Effort

Like the "Painted Skin" story depicted in "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio," no matter how much makeup a hideous monster puts on, it will eventually be recognized for what it is. Li Jinghan, who had a guilty conscience, put on a lot of makeup on his ghostly face and played many roles. Sometimes he pretended to be a terminally ill, weak old man, sighing to everyone he met: "A bird about to die sings mournfully; a man about to die speaks kindly" (Renmin University School Newspaper, Issue 152). Sometimes he pretended to be a "contemporary scholar," teaching everyone he met: "I don't admit that I am not serious in my scholarship..." "I have pursued truth, goodness, and beauty all my life" "I wrote a survey article and received hundreds of complimentary letters..." (Renmin University School Newspaper, Issues 150, 152, 155). And so on, changing at any time. However, people want to ask: Why does rightist Li Jinghan dress himself up like this? The reason is very simple: it is because he has a guilty conscience and dares not stand up openly. Sometimes when he says something, he wants to take it back. But, after all, a ghostly face is a ghostly face. The more makeup he puts on, the more he makes a fool of himself.

Under the powerful encirclement and suppression of the anti-rightist struggle, rightist Li Jinghan's anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds are already in a state of being at the end of their rope. The era of "a glimmer of light" that he dreamed of, in which he could act recklessly, is gone forever. But the era in which the people are the masters, the era of socialism and communism, is the happiest and most beautiful! Li Jinghan, it's time! It's time to smash your reactionary bourgeois colored glasses, take off your disguise, and surrender to the people and confess your crimes!

### 从“柳暗花明”谈起

    从“柳暗花明”谈起
    纪怀民
    李景汉常常喜欢用“山穷水尽”和“柳暗花明”这两句话，来形容自己的身世和遭遇。的确，这两句话能够形容他的身世和遭遇，但对这两句话的含义，我们却有着根本不同的理解。右派分子李景汉的“柳暗花明”的时代有一段漫长的岁月，这位所谓“年近古稀”的六十二岁的学者，有半个世纪都是在这个所谓“柳暗花明”的时代里度过的。从1917到1922年的五年间，也就是中国正处在“五四”运动、“六三”运动和新文化运动的革命风暴中时，李景汉却正躲在他最理想的“柳暗花明”的美国的加利福尼亚珀玛大学读“社会学”和教东方语。从1924到1948年的二十四年间，也就是中国经过三个革命阶段：北伐战争、抗日战争、解放战争的巨大变革时期，李景汉仍安然的呆在他理想的“柳暗花明”的教会大学里，为帝国主义、统治阶级训练奴仆。在此期间，他最洋洋得意的是，一度担任联合国的农业调查工作，因为在他心目中，为帝国主义服务，不以为耻反引为荣。像他自己所说的话，“乃是‘微尽绵薄’的最愉快的事啊！”
    还不很清楚吗，右派分子李景汉所处的“柳暗花明”的时代，正是大地主、大资产阶级的“柳暗花明”的时代。而在这个时代里，一切受压迫、受剥削的劳动人民，却真正处在“水深火热”“山穷水尽”必须揭竿而起的时代！
    1957年5月，在这个充满战斗的月份里，大鸣、大放的风暴，吹开了表面平静的草丛，“牛鬼蛇神”们开始显露了头角。这个披着学者外衣的李景汉，开始笑逐颜开了。他那颗凶狠毒辣的心，又想入非非了。他想到在这红杏枝头春意闹的季节里，“柳暗花明”的时代又要在他面前展开了。于是他就像朗诵赞美诗一样，放开喉咙，“歌颂”起他的时代来了：
  “我觉得生活在这个空前的伟大时代，越来越更认为是在一个人生中超乎寻常的大幸运，是真值得活着的，活着是真有意义的。因此，我要挣扎，争取非活下去不可。”（人大校刊155期）右派分子李景汉这段“赞歌”，不管他的词藻多么“美”，却掩饰不了他内心的丑恶。他要“挣扎”什么？要“争取”什么？挣扎着在他所认为的“柳暗花明”的时代里，争取一切时机，以最恶毒的言词和行动，来咒骂、反对共产党和社会主义。
    永远带着资产阶级的“有色眼镜”
    右派分子李景汉，把学习马列主义比作配眼镜，这话有真有假。所谓真，是指李景汉对待学习马列主义理论，的确抱着像配眼镜一样自欺欺人的态度。所谓假，是他永远也没想真的配上这副眼镜。他直到今天还牢牢地带着他那副资产阶级的有色眼镜。那副有色眼镜，因年久不脱，镜腿已经长入耳壳的肌肉，动手术都不易摘下来。他曾说过：“由于本行的锻炼，长期以来，只相信事实，相信‘千闻不如一见’等古语中所存在的真理。”（见5月16日人民日报发表的李景汉访问记）现在，我们就来看看他所说的“千闻不如一见”是怎样“闻”和怎样“见”的：
    其一，闻曰：我是学社会学的，解放以后有人把它叫“庸俗社会学”。
    见曰：什么是“庸俗社会学”？连我也莫名其妙。（学习杂志1957年第11期）
    右派分子李景汉只闻庸俗社会学之说，未见庸俗社会学之实，意即：资产阶级社会学并不反动也不庸俗。如是野心勃勃的奔走呼号“恢复资产阶级社会学”，他还大言不惭地说：“‘组织社会学会’应当抓紧进行，这对组织联系研究者选择人员很有利的。一年一次会，宣读论文、交换知识……这些都是很好的。在科学院设立是最适当的。一个综合大学如能开课，办一个系，我们是大力支持的，在条件成熟下，如有调查研究室（所）也要竭力赞与。”（科学院4月23日座谈会记录）李景汉力图恢复资产阶级庸俗社会学，已经不是什么“闻”“见”，而是行动了。
    其二，闻曰：共产党要整风除三害。
    见曰：共产党与知识分子之间“我认为不是墙和沟，而是万里长城，长城是否是两方面砌的呢？我不懂历史。我看蒙古人没有砌过，是汉族挡蒙族砌的。谁砌由谁拆，这个道理不说大家也明白，解铃还得系铃人。……只要有党，党群就不能在一切问题上推心置腹。（人大校刊152期）
    右派分子李景汉，闻共产党整风除三害，便见时机已到，遂大放厥词，把党与群众的某些隔阂说成是万里长城，并煽惑说，修万里长城的是共产党。只要有共产党存在，党群关系就不可能正常。言外之意就是，要群众起来打倒共产党，其用心之恶毒，可见一斑。
    其三，闻曰：应该重视培养新生力量。
    见曰：“党员没有不能做的事情”这种精神使我佩服，……当时党员认为，自己不行不要紧，反正有后台老板，把苏联专家请来。我认为只有四门理论课，可以在几个月甚至几小时成为专家。……老狗熊耍不出旧把戏，即使老狗熊耍的是旧把戏，但这个旧把戏，也许比一二年的新狗熊耍的独到的多。（人大校刊152期）
    右派分子李景汉闻培养新生力量，便深恶痛绝，大骂年轻教师为新狗熊，并不惜把老教师包括他自己在内，骂作老狗熊。指桑骂槐，极尽诬蔑政治理论课教师之能事，并说这种课几小时可以培养成专家。还挑拨中苏关系，丑化苏联专家。李景汉这些尖酸刻薄，反动透顶的言论是荒谬绝伦的。
    右派分子李景汉的“千闻不如一见”还不只如此，还有更加反动的言论。例如，抓住党员整风如同洗脸的比方，就凶狠恶毒的说：“于今党不但要洗脸上的灰尘，需要洗脸，更应该把肥皂吞到肚子里去洗一洗。”（人大校刊152期）这句话的意思就是，共产党不仅脸上有灰需要洗脸，心也是肮脏的，需要洗心。好一个恶毒的右派分子！需要洗心的不是共产党人，正是你们这些丧心病狂的右派分子自己！
    这就是右派分子李景汉，在反动资产阶级有色眼镜下面的“千闻不如一见”的真相。
    涂脂抹粉，枉费心机
    像“聊斋志异”所描写的“画皮”故事一样。狰狞的鬼怪，不管它怎样涂脂抹粉，最后还会被人识破真情。做贼心虚的李景汉，曾在自己的鬼脸上涂上了不少脂粉，扮演过不少角色。他有时扮成一位病入膏肓的懦弱无力的老朽，逢人就叹曰：“鸟之将死，其鸣也哀；人之将死，其言也善”（人大校刊152期）。他有时又扮成一位“当代学者”，逢人说教：“我不承认我学术上不严肃……”“我一生是追求真善美的一个人”“我写了一篇调查文章，收到几百封恭维信……”（人大校刊150、152、155期）。如此等等，随时变化。但是，人们要问：右派分子李景汉为什么要这样打扮自己呢？理由很简单，就是因为作贼心虚，不敢明目张胆地站出来，有时话说出口，还想收回去，但，鬼脸毕竟是鬼脸，越是涂脂抹粉，越加弄巧成拙了。
    右派分子李景汉的反党、反社会主义言行，在声势浩大的反右派斗争的围剿下，已经处在山穷水尽的境地了。他梦寐以求的，便于胡作非为的“柳暗花明”的时代已经一去不复返了。但是人民当家作主的时代，社会主义和共产主义的时代，是最幸福和最美好的！李景汉，是时候了！是摔碎你那副反动资产阶级有色眼镜、脱掉伪装、向人民投降认罪的时候了！
