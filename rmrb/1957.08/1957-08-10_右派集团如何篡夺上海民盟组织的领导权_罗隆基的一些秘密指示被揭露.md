Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 9th — In the anti-Rightist struggle, the Shanghai China Democratic League organization recently uncovered more materials exposing how Luo Longji instructed the Shanghai Rightist clique to attack the Party.

It has been revealed that Luo Longji's confidant, Zhao Wenbi, after being transferred from Shanghai to Beijing earlier this year, wrote two letters to Peng Wenyin, a key member of the Shanghai Rightist clique. In the letters, Zhao Wenbi used coded language to convey Luo Longji's instructions, informing Peng Wenyin that the country would have "problems" this year in terms of employment and industrialization, and that the most serious was the "unemployment problem," instructing him to "think of ways early and prepare to raise these issues at the upcoming Shanghai CPPCC and People's Congress." He specifically instructed: "The wording should be careful, not to pour cold water on past achievements, nor to provoke the aversion of dogmatic friends. This is to facilitate 'my plan's success.'" During the period of Great Blooming and Contending, Peng Wenyin also wrote to Zhao Wenbi reporting on the "situation" in Shanghai and asking him to relay it to Luo Longji.

Before and after the liberation of Shanghai, Luo Longji formed a Rightist clique in Shanghai with China Democratic League Rightist elements Peng Wenyin, Chen Renbing, Zhao Wenbi, Sun Siming, Sun Dayu, Zhou Yongde, Cheng Yingmiao and others, opposing the correct line of the China Democratic League and opposing the leadership of the Communist Party. Luo Longji once instructed the Rightist clique that the China Democratic League must not allow the "Shanghai University Professors' Association" (a progressive organization of university professors) to go astray, that is, not to let the "Great Professors' Association" lean completely to one side, towards the Communist Party.

It has been revealed that Luo Longji not only instructed the Rightist clique to usurp the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, but also, before leaving Shanghai for Beijing in the early days of liberation, he convened a meeting of the entire clique, instructing its members to maintain close contact, saying that Peng Wenyin had been working in Shanghai for a long time and everyone should support him. After arriving in Beijing, he continued to maintain contact with the Shanghai Rightist clique, not only taking advantage of opportunities to attend meetings in Beijing, but also frequently using correspondence to give instructions. Luo Longji successively instructed in his letters: "I believe that we should first strive for the victory of the group before talking about personal gains or losses. It is worth avoiding striving for personal gain at the expense of the group's failure. Wenyin and Renbing must pay attention to this and then resolutely achieve: 1. Resolutely oppose the CCP sending people; 2. Strive for elections, to solve problems with elections." "We must grasp the majority in the election." "The problem is that you must grasp the majority; with a majority, everything is certain; once the majority is lost, everything is subject to others." He also instructed: "There is no need to absolutely obey the United Front Department, blindly obey, let alone individually please them in private, so as to disrupt our own steps and break up unity." He also said: "Comrades in Beijing must discuss methods and steps together in advance in any struggle; this experience can be used as a reference for comrades in Shanghai."

    右派集团如何篡夺上海民盟组织的领导权
    罗隆基的一些秘密指示被揭露
    新华社上海9日电　上海民盟组织在反右派斗争中，最近又揭露出罗隆基指示上海右派集团向党进攻的一些材料。
    据揭露，罗隆基的亲信赵文璧，今年年初由上海调到北京后，曾写了两封信给上海右派集团骨干分子彭文应。赵文璧在信中用隐语传达了罗隆基的指示，通知彭文应今年国家在就业和工业化方面都有“问题”，而最严重的是“失业问题”，叫他在这些问题上“早日想办法，准备在即将到来的上海政协与人代会上提出。”并具体指示说：“提法要注意，不要给过去的成绩浇冷水，也不要引起教条朋友的反感。这为的便于‘吾计得行。’”在大鸣大放期间，彭文应还写信给赵文璧汇报上海的“形势”，并要他转告罗隆基。
    上海解放前后，罗隆基在上海和民盟右派分子彭文应、陈仁炳、赵文璧、孙斯鸣、孙大雨、周永德、程应缪等人结成右派小集团，反对民盟的正确路线，反对共产党的领导。罗隆基曾指示右派集团说，民盟一定不要使“上海大学教授联谊会”（大学教授的进步组织）走入“歧途”，即不要“大教联”一面倒，倒向共产党。
    据揭露，罗隆基不但指示右派集团篡夺民盟上海市委的领导权，他在解放初期离开上海到北京前，还曾召开一次小集团全体会议，嘱小集团成员要多联系，说彭文应在上海搞了很久，大家要支持他。到北京后，他和上海右派小集团还不断保持联系，除利用到北京开会的机会外，还经常利用信函往来作指示。罗隆基陆续在信上指示说：“我以为首先应当争取集团的胜利，而后才谈到个人的得失。争个人利益而致集团失败，这是应当值得避免的。文应、仁炳两兄必须注意这点然后坚决做到：一、坚决反对中共派人；二、争取选举，以选举解决问题。”“必须在选举中掌握多数。”
  “问题在兄等要掌握多数，有了多数，什么都有把握，一旦失去多数，一切听命于人。”他又指示说：“对统战部不必绝对服从，盲目听从，更不要个别私自讨好，以自乱步骤，拆碎团结。”他还说：“北京各友在任何斗争中必须事先共同讨论方法步骤，此项经验可供沪友参考。”
