    The Soldiers' Singing
    Han Xiao
I like the soldiers' singing
Every time I hear it, I am extremely excited
This singing surges and roars
Like the raging wind and torrential rain in the sky
This singing is sweet and affectionate
Like a murmuring stream, fragrant flowers and bright moon
As soon as I hear this singing
I think of the red flag advancing in the raging snow and wind
The bugle call to charge in the roaring artillery fire
As soon as I hear this singing, ah
The mountains and rivers and towns of the motherland
The suffering and joy of the people
All surge together in my heart
Motherland, with this heroic and powerful singing
How can your soldiers not be victorious in every battle

    战士的歌声
    韩笑我喜欢战士的歌声每一次听了都十分激动这歌声奔腾叫啸像长空怒风，暴雨山洪这歌声甜蜜多情像小溪潺潺，花香月明一听见这歌声就想起那朔风怒雪中进军的红旗炮火隆隆中冲锋的号声一听见这歌声啊祖国的山川和城镇人民的苦难和欢欣都一同汹涌在心中祖国呀，就凭这豪迈雄浑的歌声你的战士怎能不百战百胜
