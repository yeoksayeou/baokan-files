    Rightist Zhao Zeping, a member of the China Democratic Workers' and Peasants' Party from Nanchang First Middle School in Jiangxi Province, had participated in reactionary organizations such as the Kuomintang, the Three People's Principles Youth League, and the CC Clique before liberation. He slandered the educational endeavors in Nanchang City after liberation, claiming that "the land is not fully utilized, people's talents are not fully developed, teachers are not fully teaching, friendships are not fully cultivated, leaders are not fully performing their duties, learning is not fully applied, the masses are not fully speaking their minds, and words are not matching actions." He believed that the post-liberation education system was "not as good as the Kuomintang era." The teachers and students of the school refuted his reactionary remarks forcefully with facts.
    Zhao Ji, the rightist and deputy director of academic affairs at the Nanjing Radio Industry School, along with two other rightists, spent over a month during the Great Blooming and Letting Contend period writing a so-called "anti-sectarianism" reactionary article of more than 10,000 words. This article viciously smeared the Communist Party, opposed the Party's leadership, negated the achievements of the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Movements, opposed democratic centralism, opposed learning from the Soviet Union, and opposed the Party's cadre policy.
    During the anti-rightist struggle, the faculty and staff of this school formed four fighting groups to refute Zhao Ji's reactionary article. Zhao Ji has now bowed his head and confessed his guilt to the masses. (Xinhua News Agency Special Dispatch)

    中学里的牛鬼蛇神
    江西省南昌第一中学的右派分子、农工民主党成员赵则平，解放前曾先后参加过国民党、三青团、CC等反动组织。他诬蔑解放后南昌市的教育事业是“地未尽其利、人未尽其才、师未尽其教、友未尽其道、领导未尽其职、学未尽其用、群众未尽其言、言未尽其行。”他认为解放后的教育制度“不如国民党时代好”。该校师生对他的反动言论依据事实，作了有力的驳斥。
    南京市无线电工业学校教务副校长、右派分子赵骥在大鸣大放期间，他和另外两个右派分子一起费了一个多月的时间，写了长达一万多字的所谓“反对宗派主义”的反动文章，恶毒地污蔑共产党，反对党的领导，否定三反、肃反的成绩，反对民主集中制，反对向苏联学习，反对党的干部政策。
    在反右派斗争中，这个学校的教职员组成了四个战斗小组，把赵骥的反动文章，分别进行驳斥。现在赵骥已向群众低头认罪。　　　（新华社专稿）
