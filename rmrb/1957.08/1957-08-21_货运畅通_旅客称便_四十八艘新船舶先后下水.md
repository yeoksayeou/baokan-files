　　Smooth Cargo Transport, Convenient for Passengers
　　Forty-Eight New Ships Launched Successively

Xinhua News Agency, August 20th: Since August, more than ten new ships in our country have joined transportation services on the Yangtze River, Heilongjiang River, and the East China Sea. To date, our country has added forty-eight new ships this year, with a total deadweight of approximately 70,000 tons. These ships include seagoing freighters with a deadweight of 3,000 to 4,500 tons, lighter inland river tugboats and barges, as well as seagoing passenger ships and inland river passenger ships.

　　Among the newly added seagoing vessels, fifteen are freighters for transporting coal and ore, with a total deadweight of about 40,000 tons. These freighters are equipped with the latest double-compound double-expansion wide-pressure steam turbine coal-fired engines. Navigation tests have proven that this type of coal-fired engine saves 20% to 30% more coal than general coal-fired ships. The shape of the new seagoing vessels is also designed more scientifically, with less resistance, enabling them to travel two to three nautical miles per hour faster than older seagoing vessels on average.

　　The thirty-two newly added tugboats and barges used on the Yangtze River were designed by our country's technical personnel using new technologies from the world's shipbuilding industry. The tugboats' steam engines are improved steam engines, with fast running speeds, enabling them to tow much more cargo than our country's current old-fashioned tugboats of the same horsepower.

　　The newly added seagoing and inland river passenger ships this year are also designed and manufactured by our country itself. These passenger ships have changed the unreasonable aspects of our country's old passenger ships; the old passenger ships had only a few berths, and most passengers could only rest and sleep on the deck; the new passenger ships have many berths, and every passenger with an ordinary ticket has a berth.

　　These ships that have newly joined transportation services have high transportation efficiency. The seagoing freighters and passenger ships alone have transported approximately 200,000 tons of goods and several thousand passengers in one month.

　　货运畅通　旅客称便
　　四十八艘新船舶先后下水
    据新华社20日讯  8月份以来，我国又有十多艘新的船舶，分别在长江、黑龙江和东海上参加运输。至此，我国今年已经增加了四十八艘新船舶，载重量共达七万吨左右。这些船舶中有载重三千吨到四千五百吨的海上货轮，有载重较轻的内河拖轮、驳船，还有海上客轮和内河客轮。
    海上新增加的船舶中有十五艘是运送煤炭、矿石的货轮，载重量共达四万吨左右。这些货轮上装置的蒸汽机是最新的双联双涨带广汽透平式的燃煤蒸汽机；经过航行证明，这种燃煤蒸汽机比一般燃煤船省煤20％—30％。新海轮的体型也设计得比较科学，阻力小，比旧有的海轮平均每小时能多行驶两三浬。
    新增加的三十二艘用在长江的拖轮和驳船，是我国技术人员采用世界造船工业新技术而设计的。拖轮的蒸汽机是改良式的蒸汽机，行驶速度快，比我国目前同样马力的老式拖轮能多拖很多货物。
    今年新增加的海上客轮和内河客轮，也是我国自己设计和制造的。这些客轮改变了我国旧客轮不合理的地方；旧客轮上只有少数床位，大多数旅客只能在甲板上休息、睡觉；新客轮的床位很多，每一个打普通票的乘客，都有一张床位。
    新参加运输的这些船舶，运输效率都较高，仅海上的货轮和客轮，在一个月中就运送了二十万吨左右的物资和几千名旅客。
