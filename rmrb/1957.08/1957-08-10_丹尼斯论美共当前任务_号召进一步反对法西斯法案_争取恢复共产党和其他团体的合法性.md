Xinhua News Agency, August 8th, New York Dispatch: The "Daily Worker" published an article by Eugene Dennis, a leader of the American Communist Party, on August 5th. The article commented on the political situation in the United States in light of the recent Supreme Court announcement overturning the convictions of five Communist Party leaders in California. He also put forward the current tasks of the American Communist Party and American progressive forces on the domestic front.

Dennis said that the Supreme Court's decision on June 17th to acquit five Communist Party leaders in California who were persecuted under the Smith Act was a heavy blow to the entire pro-fascist and repressive legislative and prosecution system. He said that many factors contributed to the Supreme Court's decision, especially a series of favorable changes in the political atmosphere.

In recent times, the movements to strive for disarmament and a ban on hydrogen bomb testing, and to strive for the development of East-West trade relations have grown stronger. People in the United States are widely exploring whether individual freedom should be sacrificed for national security. All of this, coupled with favorable trends in international affairs, has played an important role in influencing the political atmosphere in which the court takes action.

Domestically, the strong and vigorous efforts of the American Communist Party and other progressive forces over the years, as well as their anti-McCarthy activities, including various united front movements formed around most trials, and the struggle of many conservatively-minded lawyers, some socialist leaders, and many educators and religious figures to stop the Smith and McCarthy Act prosecutions, as well as the positive influence of our Sixteenth National Congress, have all played a beneficial role.

Dennis said that although the Supreme Court has made favorable rulings on civil liberties and civil rights issues, the ability, momentum, and danger of the reactionaries in launching a counterattack should not be underestimated. The obstacles faced by the Supreme Court's desegregation order for two and a half years; the provocative calls by white supremacists for the impeachment of a majority of the Supreme Court justices; and the efforts of Walter, Jenner, Eastland, and others to demand the implementation of new laws to undermine recent rulings; all of these facts highlight this danger.

Dennis said that in this situation, the American progressive forces, including the American Communist Party, should take the following measures in order to counterattack the reactionary forces and promote the entire struggle for democratic rights and civil rights. The democratic significance of the Supreme Court's decision and its significance for all Americans (whether they are communists or non-communists) must be widely publicized. It must be emphasized that there is a new basis for the struggle and the great responsibility that labor and people's forces bear in this situation; broad united front movements must be organized locally to stop further lawsuits under the Smith Act; based on the Supreme Court's decision and more favorable objective conditions, a new movement to pardon Winston, Green, and Irving Potash should now be launched; all opponents of the Smith Act should consider how to influence legislators to introduce a proposal in Congress to repeal the parts of the Smith Act concerning organizational activities, conspiracy, and party membership; attention should be focused on raising important issues such as safeguarding the Constitution and democratic rulings of the court in new ways, especially on opposing and repealing the Smith Act, the McCarran Act, the McCarran-Walter Act, etc.; special attention needs to be paid to persuading and mobilizing a new segment of the labor movement to speak out and insist on their rights; the immediate task is to convince the entire party and leftists of the new political and legal opportunities to restore the legality of the Communist Party and other minority and radical groups. This should be achieved with courage, new initiative, and a realistic attitude; in addition, it is necessary to identify and take advantage of all new possible opportunities to build the party, expand the party's political influence, and establish new and broader united front relations for the labor and democratic movement.

    丹尼斯论美共当前任务
    号召进一步反对法西斯法案
    争取恢复共产党和其他团体的合法性
    新华社8日讯　纽约消息：“工人日报”8月5日刊载了美国共产党领导人尤金·丹尼斯的一篇文章，就美国最高法院不久前宣布撤销对加利福尼亚州五个共产党领导人的判决一事，评论美国的政治形势，并且提出美国共产党和美国进步力量当前在国内战线上的任务。
    丹尼斯说，美国最高法院6月17日作出的宣布加利福尼亚五个受史密斯法迫害的共产党领导人为无罪的裁决，使整个亲法西斯的和镇压性的立法和起诉制度受到了一次沉重打击。他说，促成最高法院作出这一决定的，有许多因素，特别是政治气氛中一系列良好的改变。
    在最近的时期中，争取裁减军备和禁止氢弹试验、争取发展东西方贸易关系的运动日益壮大，美国国内的人们在广泛地探究是否应当为了国家安全而牺牲个人自由——这一切加上国际事务中的良好趋向在影响法院采取行动时的政治气氛方面起了重要的作用。
    在国内方面，若干年来美国共产党和其他进步力量的坚强有力以及它们进行的反麦卡锡活动，其中包括环绕着大多数审讯形成的各种统一战线运动以及许多有保守思想的律师、某些社会党领袖、许多教育界和宗教界参加制止史密斯和麦卡锡法起诉案件的斗争，还有我们的第十六次全国代表大会的积极影响，都发挥了有益的作用。
    丹尼斯说，虽然最高法院在公民自由和公民权利问题上作出了有利的裁决，但是，决不应该低估反动派在进行反攻方面所具有的能力、声势和危险性。两年半以来最高法院废除种族隔离的命令所遭受的障碍；白种优越论者发出挑衅性的呼吁，要求弹劾最高法院的大多数法官；华尔特、真纳、伊斯特兰和其他一些人也努力要求实行新的法律来破坏最近的裁决；这一些事实都着重表明了这种危险性。
    丹尼斯说，在这种情况下，包括美国共产党在内的美国进步力量，为了进行对反动势力的反击和推动整个争取民主权利和民权的斗争，应该采取如下一些措施。必须广泛宣传最高法院这一决定的民主意义和它对一切美国人（不论是共产党人还是非共产党人）所包含的意义。必须强调指出现在进行斗争的新的基础，以及劳工和人民力量在这种局势下所负的重大责任；在地方上组织广泛的统一战线运动制止根据史密斯法继续提出诉讼；根据最高法院的决定和比较有利的客观条件，现在展开一个争取赦免温斯顿、格林和欧文·鲍达希的新运动；一切反对史密斯法的人应该考虑怎样设法影响议员在国会中提出一项提案，规定取消史密斯法内关于组织活动、阴谋和党籍等部分；应该着重注意用新的方式提出维护宪法和法院民主判决等重要问题，特别应该着重注意反对和取消史密斯、麦卡伦法、麦卡伦—华尔特法等等问题；需要特别注意说服和动员工人运动中的新的一部分人大声疾呼，坚持自己的权利；目前的要务是要使全党和左翼人士相信政治上和法律上出现的争取恢复共产党和其他少数团体和激进团体的合法性的新机会。这应当以勇敢、新的主动精神和现实的态度来达到；此外，必需指出和利用一切新的可能的机会来建党，扩大党的政治影响，使劳工和民主运动建立新的更广泛的联合阵线的关系。
