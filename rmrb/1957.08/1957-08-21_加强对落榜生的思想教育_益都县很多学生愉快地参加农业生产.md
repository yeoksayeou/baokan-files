Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 20th: After the Yidu County Graduate Work Team strengthened ideological education for students who failed college entrance exams and conducted social publicity and education, many students happily participated in agricultural production.

The county's Graduate Work Team is composed of 120 people, including primary school principals and teaching directors from middle and primary schools. They set off at the end of July and formed work groups in each district. Whenever they arrived in a township or commune, they first participated in field production, using field chats and individual visits to understand the ideological situation of students, parents, and the masses regarding the admission and employment of graduating students. These work groups, while participating in all meetings of townships, communes, and production teams, combined the local production tasks with the implementation of the state's instructions on graduate placement. They unified understanding among cadres and jointly formed a large social publicity force with township and commune cadres and returning teachers. For individual students and parents, they also held small forums or conducted home visits to eliminate some unnecessary concerns and resistance among students who failed the exams regarding participating in labor. Sun Yufeng, a graduate of Yangma Township Elementary School in this county, cried a lot at home when she heard that she had not been admitted; Liu Yaoguang, a graduate of Hujiamiao Junior High School, was very nervous before the results were announced. After persuasion and education by the work group, their emotions stabilized, and they both happily participated in production after failing the exams. Chen Ziqin, a parent of a student in Yangma Township, used to think that going to school was the only way out for his son. Now, after publicity and education, he has changed his attitude and agreed that if his child fails to get into school, he will participate in agricultural production.

The Graduate Work Team participates in field production three afternoons a week, which greatly encourages students to participate in production. Many students have reported: "The teachers are going to the countryside to participate in labor during the holidays, so we have no objections to participating in production." Currently, the emotions of students who failed the exams have stabilized, and many have happily picked up their hoes and headed to the fields.

　　加强对落榜生的思想教育
　　益都县很多学生愉快地参加农业生产
    新华社济南20日电　山东省益都县毕业生工作队加强了落榜生的思想教育和社会宣传教育以后，有很多学生愉快地参加了农业生产。
    这个县的毕业生工作队由小学校长和中、小学校的教导主任等一百二十人组成，他们于7月底出发，到每个区又组成工作小组。他们每到一个乡、社，首先参加田间生产，利用田间谈心和个别访问来了解学生、家长和群众对应届毕业生升学、就业问题的思想情况。这些工作组在参加乡社和生产队的一切会议当中，结合当地的生产任务，贯彻了国家对毕业生安排工作的指示，在干部中统一了认识，并与乡、社干部和回乡的教师等共同组成了庞大的社会宣传力量。对于个别学生和家长，还召开小型座谈会或进行家庭访问，消除落榜生参加劳动的一些不必要的顾虑和阻力。这个县杨马乡高小毕业生孙玉凤听说自己没有录取，在家里大哭大闹；扈家庙初中毕业生刘耀光在发榜前非常紧张。他们经过工作组的劝导教育，情绪便安定下来了，落榜后都愉快地参加了生产。杨马乡学生家长陈子勤以前认为儿子只有上学才是唯一出路，现在，经过宣传教育，他转变了态度，同意孩子考不上学，就参加农业生产。
    毕业生工作组每周有三个下午参加田间生产，对鼓励学生参加生产作用很大，不少学生反映：老师们在假期里都下乡参加劳动，我们参加生产一点意见也没有了。目前落榜生的情绪已经安定下来，有很多人已愉快地扛起锄头走向田间。
