Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 14th: Pyongyang held a grand rally on the evening of the 14th to celebrate the twelfth anniversary of the liberation of Korea on “August 15th.”

Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Cabinet of Korea, Kim Tu-bong, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly, and other leaders of the Korean Workers' Party and the government attended the rally. Also participating were leaders of various democratic parties and social organizations in Korea, senior generals of the People's Army, and people from all walks of life.

Soviet Ambassador to Korea, Puzanov, Chinese Ambassador to Korea, Qiao Xiaoguang, and other foreign diplomatic envoys to Korea attended the rally. A delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteers headed by Major General Ding Laifu was invited to participate.

Korean Deputy Prime Minister Choi Yong-kun delivered a report at the rally. He said that the Korean people cherish the friendship and solidarity with the Soviet people and will continue to work to strengthen this friendship and solidarity. He said that the Korean people are implementing the first Five-Year Plan on the basis of successfully completing the Three-Year Plan. At the same time, Korea is about to hold elections for the Supreme People's Assembly to further strengthen the people's regime.

Soviet Ambassador Puzanov also spoke at the rally.

(Dispatch from our newspaper in Pyongyang, August 14th) In the four years since the Korean armistice, Pyongyang has restored and newly built more than 50,000 buildings of various types, restored and newly built more than 60 large and medium-sized factories and enterprises equipped with modern production equipment, and more than 70 schools at all levels. Its population has reached more than 600,000 – exceeding the pre-war level. Looking out today, countless newly built high-rise buildings are adorned with colorful flags, forming all kinds of patterns that stretch as far as the eye can see; the newly built, wide and flat streets extend straight into the distance, and vehicles of all sizes swim back and forth on the streets like schools of fish; chimneys standing in the suburbs are spewing thick smoke. This is the scene of Pyongyang today.

Of Pyongyang's post-war construction, housing accounts for the largest proportion. By the end of last year, a total of 1.8 million square meters had been newly built, and another 340,000 square meters began to be newly built in the first half of this year. In the ordinary Munlu and East Pyongyang apartment areas, which used to be remote suburbs, large modern residential areas have now been built. More than 20 large office buildings, led by the No. 1 and No. 2 integrated office buildings of the Cabinet's various ministries, and modern streets such as Stalin Street, Mao Zedong Street, and People's Army Road, constitute the backbone of this new socialist city. The five-story building of Kim Il-sung University and the two five-story buildings of the newly built Kim Chaek University of Technology are relatively magnificent buildings in Pyongyang; many other newly built middle schools are also three- or four-story buildings. In addition, Pyongyang has also restored and built 200 stores of various sizes and 22 theaters and cinemas, 25 hospitals and clinics, and restored parks with an area of 3 million square meters. The Moranbong Park, which was severely damaged during the war, is now shaded by green trees and blooming with flowers, attracting a constant stream of visitors.

Pyongyang is not only built more magnificently and beautifully, but it is also a light industrial base. The Pyongyang Textile Factory, Rubber Factory, Tobacco Factory, Grain Factory, Furniture Factory, and many other factories and enterprises built after the war are producing a large number of daily consumer goods to meet the needs of the people.

Like Pyongyang, the restoration and construction work in various parts of Korea has developed at a miraculous speed. By the end of last year, 320 large and medium-sized factories and enterprises in northern Korea had been restored and built. In the first half of this year, important production equipment such as the rayon workshop of the Chongjin Artificial Fiber Factory and the Sinpo Fish Cannery have also been restored and built. Last year's total industrial output value reached 1.8 times that of the pre-war year of 1949.

Near Anju, northwest of Pyongyang, the South Pyongan Province irrigation project, which can irrigate 40,000 hectares of farmland, was completed last year, bringing an unprecedented harvest to the area covering four counties. After the armistice, farmers restored and newly built more than 170 water conservancy and irrigation projects, expanding the irrigated area by more than 134,000 hectares, making last year's grain output exceed the pre-war level.

The vast cities and rural areas have also been restored. By the end of last year, more than 13 million square meters of housing had been restored and built in various places, and more than 5,000 schools of various levels had been newly built after the war, with 2.08 million students attending school. The people's lives have also improved significantly.

The Korean people are continuing to advance towards the great goal of achieving the first Five-Year Plan and for the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

    平壤集会庆祝解放十二周年
    朝鲜北部工农业四年来蓬勃发展
    新华社平壤14日电　平壤各界在14日晚间举行了“八一五”朝鲜解放十二周年庆祝大会。
    朝鲜内阁首相金日成、最高人民会议常任委员会委员长金枓奉等朝鲜劳动党和政府的领导人参加了大会。参加大会的还有朝鲜各民主党派和社会团体负责人、人民军高级将领以及各界人士。
    苏联驻朝鲜大使普扎诺夫、中国驻朝鲜大使乔晓光和其他各国驻朝鲜外交使节都参加了大会。以丁莱夫少将为首的中国人民志愿军代表团应邀参加了大会。
    朝鲜内阁副首相崔庸健在大会上作了报告。他说，朝鲜人民十分珍视同苏联人民的友谊和团结，并且将继续为加强这种友谊团结而努力。他说，朝鲜人民正在胜利完成三年计划的基础上执行第一个五年计划。同时，朝鲜即将举行最高人民会议的选举，以进一步加强人民政权。
    苏联大使普扎诺夫也在大会上讲了话。
    本报平壤14日电　朝鲜停战四年来，平壤已恢复和新建起五万多幢各种建筑物，恢复和新建起装有现代生产设备的六十多个大中型工厂企业和七十多所各级学校。它的人口已达到六十多万——超过了战前。今天登高下望，只见无数新建的高楼大厦上彩旗招展，组成各种各样的图案，一眼望不到边；新修成的宽阔坦平的大街，笔直地伸向远方，大大小小的车辆像鱼群一样在街上游来游去；市郊矗立着的烟囱在吐着浓烟。这就是今天平壤的情景。
    平壤战后的建设，住宅占的比重最大。到去年年底，共新建了一百八十万平方公尺，今年上半年又开始新建三十四万平方公尺。在普通门路和东平壤的公寓路，过去都是市郊荒僻的地方，现在都已经建成大片现代化的楼房住宅区。新建起来的以内阁各省综合办公厅第一号和第二号为首的二十多座大型的办公大楼和新修成的斯大林大街、毛泽东大街、人民军路等现代化街道，构成了这个新型的社会主义城市的骨胳。金日成综合大学五层大楼和新建起来的金策工业大学的两座五层大楼，是平壤市比较辉煌的建筑；其他许多新建的中学也都是三、四层楼房。此外，平壤还恢复建设了二百个大小商店和二十二个剧场、电影院、二十五所医院、诊疗所，并且恢复了三百万平方公尺面积的公园。战时遭受严重破坏的牡丹峰公园，现在已是绿树成荫，花开遍地，游人不断。
    平壤不仅建设得更宏伟更美丽了，同时它还是一个轻工业基地。战后建成的平壤纺织工厂、橡胶工厂、烟草工厂、谷物工厂、家具工厂等许多工厂企业，正在生产着大量的日用消费品，供应人民的需要。
    像平壤一样，朝鲜各地的恢复建设工作，都以奇迹似的速度发展起来。到去年年底为止，朝鲜北部已有三百二十个大、中型工厂企业恢复建成。今年上半年又有清津人造纤维工厂的人造丝车间、新浦鱼类罐头工厂等重要生产设备恢复建设起来。去年的工业生产总产值已经达到战前1949年的一点八倍。
    在平壤西北的安州附近，去年建成了能够灌溉四万町步田地的平安南道灌溉工程，使广及四个郡的地区获得了历史上从未有过的丰收。停战后，农民恢复新建了一百七十多个水利灌溉工程，扩大了灌溉面积十三万四千多町步，使去年的粮食产量超过了战前。
    广大的城市、农村也恢复起来了。到去年年底，各地已恢复建设了一千三百多万平方公尺的住宅，战后新建的各级学校达五千多所，有二百零八万学生在上学。人民的生活也有了显著的改善。
    朝鲜人民正在为了达成第一个五年计划的伟大目标，为了祖国的和平统一而继续前进。（附图片）
