Xinhua News Agency, August 1st: The anti-Rightist struggle in the capital's publishing circles is developing in depth. At three symposiums held in publishing circles on July 23, 26, and 31, participants systematically criticized the various common reactionary arguments of rightist elements such as Zeng Yanxiu, Lan Yu, Xiao Qian, and Hu Ming with reasoned arguments.

Workers' Publishing House's Chen Xiwen and Wu Congyun, in a joint speech, focused on refuting the rightist elements Zeng Yanxiu, Lan Yu, and others' defense of their erroneous remarks, claiming they were merely ideological problems and not politically anti-Party and anti-socialist. The joint speech stated that the People's Publishing House, as a national political book publishing institution, works under the leadership of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee and the Ministry of Culture of the State Council, but Zeng Yanxiu said that "the People's Publishing House has no backstage boss," and he advocated that "relevant publishing houses should each find their own backstage boss." Isn't this obviously politically anti-Party? Zeng Yanxiu believes that the Party cannot lead the publishing industry. Isn't this not entirely consistent with the anti-Party formula of bourgeois rightist elements, "The Party cannot lead X"? Zeng Yanxiu cursed: "Without wearing a Marxist hat or a coat of Marxist-Leninist phrases, you cannot enter the door of the People's Publishing House." It seems that it is precisely for this reason that Zeng Yanxiu advocated finding the "backstage boss" he liked and opposed the Party's leadership over the People's Publishing House.

Chen Yuan, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the People's Publishing House, said that like other construction work in our country, learning from the Soviet Union is one of the fundamental guidelines for building a socialist publishing industry. He said that from 1950 to 1956, the Chinese publishing industry translated and published a total of more than 13,000 Soviet books. These books included classic works of Marxism-Leninism, historical documents of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, academic works by contemporary Soviet scholars promoting and explaining Marxism-Leninism, as well as a large number of natural science, production technology, and literary books. The publication of these books greatly helped to widely carry out Marxist-Leninist ideological education among the people of our country, adding beneficial ideological nourishment to us; it extensively publicized the advanced construction experience and scientific achievements of the Soviet Union, which played a great guiding and assisting role in our country's socialist construction and scientific research work; it widely introduced the moral face of Soviet socialist society and the qualities of socialist new people, enriching our spiritual life. Chen Yuan indignantly rebuked the rightist elements such as Zeng Yanxiu, saying that they not only reversed black and white to obliterate these iron facts, but also added charges to learning from Soviet experience and translating Soviet books, such as hindering the development of the publishing industry, poisoning readers, and restricting freedom of thought. Chen Yuan said: Why do Zeng Yanxiu, Lan Yu, and others hate learning from the Soviet Union so much? The essence lies in opposing the leadership of the Party and the state over the publishing industry in a socialist country, and opposing the planning of the publishing industry. They call these "unification" and "monopoly." Chen Yuan said: It is precisely the establishment of the Party and the state's leadership over publishing work that fundamentally changed the capitalist nature of the old Chinese publishing industry and ended the anarchic state of publishing in old China. It is precisely because of planning that the implementation of the Party and the state's policies and guidelines has been guaranteed, and the publishing freedom of the vast majority of the people has been guaranteed. Chen Yuan also pointed out that the reason why Zeng Yanxiu opposes translating and publishing Soviet books is, in essence, opposing the promotion of Marxism-Leninism.

Sa Kongliao, director of the Nationalities Publishing House, said at the meeting: We did not have a publishing house for ethnic minority languages in our history. The newly established Nationalities Publishing House after liberation has published more than 1,200 books in a total of seven languages, totaling 12 million copies. The Nationalities Publishing House implements planned loss subsidies, and the losses are increasing year by year. Books in ethnic minority languages are generally longer than the Chinese versions, some more than twice as long, but the price is lower than the Chinese versions. Is such a policy possible under a capitalist system?

Zhu Xiuheng of the Popular Reading Publishing House exposed the despicable methods used by the rightist element Lan Yu to carry out anti-Party and anti-socialist activities with facts. When spreading his various rightist ideas, Lan Yu often did not express his opinions clearly himself, but instructed others to write articles, and then helped to revise them, sometimes even changing them beyond recognition, but still publishing them under other people's names, and not allowing others to use pseudonyms, because he was afraid that "the outside world would guess and think of him." After other people's articles were published, Lan Yu appeared as a "representative of public opinion," using the technique of quoting other people's articles to smuggle in his personal reactionary views.

    曾彦修、蓝钰、萧乾、胡明一鼻孔出气
    首都出版界揭穿右派分子的反动实质
    新华社1日讯　首都出版界反右派斗争正向深入发展。在7月23日、26日和31日分别举行的出版界三次座谈会上，参加会议的人对曾彦修、蓝钰、萧乾、胡明等右派分子的各种共同性的反动论点作了系统的说理批判。
    工人出版社陈希文、吴从云在联合发言中着重驳斥曾彦修、蓝钰等右派分子对自己的错误言论的辩解，说成只是思想问题而不是政治上反党反社会主义。联合发言说，作为国家政治书籍出版机关的人民出版社是在中共中央宣传部和国务院文化部的领导下工作的，但是曾彦修却说什么“人民出版社是没有后台老板的”，他主张“有关出版社各自找自己的后台老板”，这不是明显的在政治上反党是什么？曾彦修认为党不能领导出版事业，这与资产阶级右派分子的反党公式
  “党不能领导Ｘ”不完全一致吗？曾彦修诅咒说：“不戴一顶马克思主义的帽子，没有马列词句外衣，不能进人民出版社的门”，看来正是因为这个原因曾彦修才主张寻找他喜欢的“后台老板”，反对党对人民出版社的领导。
    人民出版社副总编辑陈原说，和我国其他各项建设工作一样，向苏联学习是建设社会主义出版事业的根本方针之一。他说，从1950年到1956年，中国出版界总共翻译出版的苏联书籍有一万三千多种，这些书籍包括马克思列宁主义的经典著作，苏联共产党的历史文献，苏联当代学者宣传和解释马列主义的学术著作，以及大量的自然科学、生产技术和文学书籍。这些书籍的出版，大大地帮助了在我国人民中广泛进行马列主义思想教育的工作，给我们增加了有益的思想养料；大规模地宣传了苏联先进的建设经验和科学成就，这对我国的社会主义建设和科学研究工作起了极大的指导和辅导作用；广泛介绍了苏联社会主义社会的道德面貌和社会主义的新人的品质，丰富了我们的精神生活。陈原十分愤慨地斥责曾彦修等右派分子说，他们不但颠倒黑白地抹杀这些铁的事实，并且给学习苏联经验，翻译苏联书籍加上了妨碍出版事业发展，毒害了读者，束缚了思想自由等等罪状。陈原说：曾彦修、蓝钰等为什么痛恨学习苏联呢？本质就在于反对在社会主义国家内党和国家对于出版事业的领导，反对出版事业的计划化，他们把这些叫做“大一统”，叫做“垄断”。陈原说：正是确立了党和国家对出版工作的领导权，才从根本上改变了旧中国出版事业的资本主义性质，结束了旧中国出版的无政府状态。正是因为计划化，才保证了党和国家政策方针的贯彻，保证了最大多数人民的出版自由。陈原又指出曾彦修所以反对翻译出版苏联书籍，骨子里是反对宣传马克思列宁主义。
    民族出版社社长萨空了在会上说：我们历史上没有民族文字的出版社。解放后新成立的民族出版社，总共用七种文字，出版了一千二百多种，总共一千二百万册的图书。民族出版社是实行计划亏损补贴的，并且亏损一年比一年多。民族文字版的书籍，篇幅一般比汉文版多，有的多一倍以上，但价钱却比汉文版低，这样的政策，难道在资本主义制度下是可能的吗？
    通俗读物出版社祝修恒以事实揭发了右派分子蓝钰进行反党反社会主义活动时的卑鄙手法。蓝钰在散布他的各种右派思想时，常常不是自己明白地出来表示意见，而是授意别人去写文章，然后帮助修改，有时甚至改得面目全非，但仍然用别人的名字发表，并且不让别人用笔名，因为他怕“外界猜来猜去又想到他的头上”。在别人的文章发表后，蓝钰又以“舆论代表者”的姿态出现，以引用别人文章的手法来私运他个人的反动观点。
