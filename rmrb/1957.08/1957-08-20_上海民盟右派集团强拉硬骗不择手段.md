The Shanghai China Democratic League (CDL) rightist group resolutely implemented the "great expansion" directive of the Zhang-Luo alliance. Rightist Chen Renbing once said: Shanghai has many intellectuals, so the Shanghai CDL should not have just two or three thousand members, but tens of thousands. He made this plan for the Shanghai CDL organization: "Have a certain number of upper-level 'brand names,' plus nearly ten thousand members." He believed that only in this way would it look respectable and be enough to rival the Party.

The rightist group chose the literary and art, news, and judicial circles, as well as accountants, which had more problems and complex situations, as the focus of their great expansion, gradually extending to medical, scientific, and educational fields. They personally and unscrupulously used methods such as visiting homes, inviting to dinner, promising official positions, not requiring self-biographies, allowing CDL full-time cadres to fill out membership application forms on behalf of applicants, and not requiring participation in oaths, to recruit people into the League. The membership application of artist Liu Haisu had not yet been approved, but he had already been arranged to be a member of the CDL Municipal Committee. When Chen Renbing developed Pingtan performers Liu Tianyun and Jiang Yuequan to join the League, he also told them that he would arrange for them to be members of the CDL Municipal Committee.

During the Communist Party's rectification campaign, the CDL rightist group put forward the slogan of "joining the League at the front line" while setting fires everywhere, and collected a large number of people who were dissatisfied with the Party and frantically attacking the Party into the League. The Shanghai CDL rightist group thus pulled many backward elements, even people with unclear political backgrounds and counter-revolutionaries, into the League. Among the one hundred and forty-six people directly introduced into the League by rightist backbone elements such as Chen Renbing, Peng Wenying, Han Ming, Zhao Wenbi, and Sun Siming, more than ten have now been exposed as rightists. Zhao Wang, a Blue Shirts Society secret agent who has been arrested, and counter-revolutionaries Wang Jiadong, Tao Bin, Huang Hanwu, and Gao Dingyi were all introduced into the League by Chen Renbing and Zhao Wenbi respectively.

    上海民盟右派集团强拉硬骗不择手段
    上海民盟右派集团坚决执行了章罗联盟“大发展”的指示。右派分子陈仁炳曾说：上海知识分子多，上海盟员不是二、三千人的问题，而是上万人的问题。他替上海民盟组织作了这样一个打算：“有一定数量的上层‘名牌’，加上近万的盟员”。认为这样才像样，才足以和党分庭抗礼。
    右派集团选择了问题较多、情况复杂的文艺、新闻、司法界和会计师等作为大发展的重点，逐步扩大到医务、科技、教育等方面。他们亲自出马不择手段地采取登门拜访、请客吃饭、封官许愿、不写自传、入盟申请书可由民盟专职干部代填、可以不参加宣誓等方式，拉人入盟。美术工作者刘海粟的入盟申请还未批准，就已被安排为民盟市委委员。陈仁炳在发展评弹演员刘天韵、蒋月泉入盟时，也向他俩表示过，要安排他俩当民盟市委委员。
    共产党整风期间，民盟右派集团在到处放火时提出了“火线入盟”的口号，搜罗大批对党不满的、向党猖狂进攻的人入盟。上海民盟右派集团就这样地把许多落后分子，甚至政治面目不清的人和反革命分子拉入盟内。从陈仁炳、彭文应、韩鸣、赵文璧、孙斯鸣等右派骨干分子直接介绍入盟的一百四十六人中，现已揭发的右派分子就有十多名。已逮捕的蓝衣社特务赵望和反革命分子王家栋、陶彬、黄汉武、高鼎伊等都是陈仁炳、赵文璧分别介绍入盟的。　　　（余辉音）
