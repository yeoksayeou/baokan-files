    Volunteer Childcare Workers
    Recently, in the open-air dance hall of the Jinzhou Textile Factory, every day six or seven hundred preschool children sing and dance in the shade of the trees, while others sit in circles under the awnings listening to stories. These children used to gather in the collective family dormitories. They were older than the age for nurseries and daycare centers, but not old enough to attend school, so they made a lot of noise at home all day, disturbing the workers' sleep. At the Workers' Representative Assembly held this year, workers and parents raised requests, hoping that the leadership would solve this problem. After the meeting, the trade union organized a childcare team of six or seven hundred children in the collective dormitory, with more than a dozen housewives serving as volunteer childcare workers, taking these children to the open-air dance hall or other places to play at certain times every day. This not only allows workers on the third shift to sleep peacefully, but also relieves many mothers of their worries about accidents happening to their children. (Excerpt from "Luda Daily")

    义务保育员
    最近，在金州纺织厂的露天舞厅里，每天都有六七百名学前儿童在林荫深处唱歌跳舞，也有的团团坐在凉棚下听讲故事。这些儿童过去都聚集在集体家属宿舍里，他们超过了托儿所和托儿站的年龄，但又不到入学年龄，因此成天在家里吵闹，搅得工人睡不着觉。在今年召开的职工代表大会上，工人和家长们提出了要求，希望领导上解决这个问题。会后，工会便在集体宿舍里组织了一个六七百名儿童的托儿队，由十几名家庭妇女担任义务保育员，每天都按一定时间领着这些孩子们到露天舞厅或别的地方去游戏。这样不仅使干三班的工人可以安静的睡觉，而许多孩子妈妈也用不着担心自己的孩子会发生事故了。　（摘自旅大日报）
