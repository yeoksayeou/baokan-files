Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 23rd: Since the beginning of the rectification campaign, the leadership style of leading cadres at all levels of the Shenyang Military Region has greatly improved. A relatively common phenomenon is that leading cadres are going deeper into the lower levels and caring more about the work and lives of their subordinates. Several leaders of a certain unit often go down to the companies and live with the soldiers, helping them solve problems and experience their lives. The leader of a certain unit stipulated that Saturday mornings would be reception days, personally talking to soldiers in the camp and listening to their opinions. In order to study and improve the soldiers' meals, the political commissar of a certain unit personally went to the soldiers' canteen and brainstormed ideas with everyone. Battalion instructor Bian Zhan'ao personally went to the kitchen to help the cooks prepare meals. When he saw that the kitchen floor was wet and it was inconvenient for the cooks to carry water in cloth shoes, he mobilized the cadres to buy rubber shoes for the cooks. In addition, leaders at all levels actively participated in physical labor and work-break exercises with the officers and soldiers, and often went deep into the cadres' dormitories to inquire about their well-being. In addition to providing care for Hui soldiers in their daily lives, all units also gave Hui soldiers leave during Hui festivals in accordance with Hui customs.

The Party committees and leaders at all levels of the Shenyang Garrison attach great importance to saving military land and returning public and private housing as much as possible. According to statistics, from January to mid-July this year alone, more than 104,000 square meters of public housing were returned to the local authorities, and more than 1,300 private houses were returned. In order to facilitate the production of farmers and fishermen, many troops have returned more than 19,000 mu of military land for use by agricultural cooperatives.

    沈阳部队领导干部更加深入下层
　　关怀下级的工作和生活
    节约军事用地，尽量退还公房民房
    据新华社沈阳23日电　整风开始以来，沈阳部队各级领导干部的领导作风有了很大的改进。比较普遍的现象是领导干部更加深入下层和关怀下级的工作和生活了。某部的几位首长常下连队和士兵住在一起，帮助士兵解决问题，体验士兵生活。某部首长规定每星期六上午为接待日，亲自到营和士兵谈话，听取意见。某部政委为了研究改进士兵伙食，亲自到士兵食堂和大家一起想办法。营教导员边占鳌亲自下厨房帮助炊事员做饭，当他看到厨房地面湿，炊事员穿布鞋挑水不方便时，就发动干部买胶鞋送给炊事员。此外，各级首长还积极地和官兵一起参加体力劳动，做工间操，并且常常深入到干部宿舍问寒问暖。各单位除在生活上给予回族士兵照顾外，并且在回族节日按照回族习惯放回族士兵的假。
    沈阳驻军各级党委和首长都十分重视节约军事用地和尽量退还公房和民房。据统计，仅今年1月到7月中旬，退给当地的公房就有十万四千多平方公尺，退还民房一千三百多间。许多部队为便利农民和渔民生产，退出了一万九千多亩军事用地给农业社使用。
