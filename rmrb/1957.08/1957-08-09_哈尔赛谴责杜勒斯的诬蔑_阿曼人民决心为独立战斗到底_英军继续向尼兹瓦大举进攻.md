Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, August 7th – Halsey, the representative of the Imam of Oman in Cairo, said today that U.S. Secretary of State Dulles' statement on the Omani situation cannot stop the revolution of Omani nationalists and will only stimulate them to carry out the revolution without relying on foreign aid in order to achieve independence for themselves.

Dulles, on August 6, described the Omani people's struggle against Britain as "disturbances" at a press conference. He said: "We hope these disturbances will not develop to a large scale."

Halsey emphasized: "We are determined to fight until we achieve independence. Guerrilla warfare will never stop in Oman."

Xinhua News Agency, August 8th – Manama (in Bahrain) dispatch: A British official spokesman said today that British forces attacking Omani insurgents advanced from Izki towards Nizwa, the insurgents' headquarters, this morning under the cover of jet fighters, and occupied the two villages of Kalsha and Lada.

He said the target of the British forces' attack today was Firq, five miles from Nizwa. Izki is fifteen miles from Nizwa.

According to Western news agencies, the British attacking force, led by Brigadier Robertson, totals approximately eight hundred men. In addition to British air cover, the force is equipped with armored vehicles, jeeps, heavy machine guns, and mortars. Behind this force, a contingent of the Sultan of Muscat's troops is also said to be following.

Meanwhile, Reuters reported that Air Marshal Patch, Commander-in-Chief of the British Air Force in the Middle East, also flew from Bahrain to Muscat (the capital of the Sultanate of Muscat) today to discuss with the Sultan of Muscat the role of the British Air Force in the suppression of the Omani insurgents.

    哈尔赛谴责杜勒斯的诬蔑
    阿曼人民决心为独立战斗到底
    英军继续向尼兹瓦大举进攻
    据新华社开罗7日电　阿曼教长驻开罗代表哈尔赛今天说，美国国务卿杜勒斯关于阿曼局势的声明阻挡不了阿曼民族主义者的革命，只会刺激他们不依靠外国援助而把革命进行下去，以便为自己取得独立。
    杜勒斯8月6日曾经在记者招待会上把阿曼人民反抗英国的斗争说成是“骚乱”。他说：“我们希望这种骚乱不会发展到很大的规模。”
    哈尔赛强调说：“我们决心战斗到取得独立为止。游击战争决不会在阿曼停止。”
    据新华社8日讯　马纳马（在巴林岛）消息：英国官方发言人今天说，英国进攻阿曼起义者的部队今天清晨在喷气式战斗机掩护下，从伊兹向起义者总部所在地尼兹瓦前进，并且占领了卡尔沙和腊达两个村庄。
    他说，英国部队今天进攻的目标是距离尼兹瓦五英里的菲尔克。伊兹距离尼兹瓦十五英里。
    据西方通讯社报道，由罗伯逊准将率领的英国进攻部队共有约八百人。这批部队除有英国空军掩护外，还配备有装甲车、吉普车、重机枪和迫击炮等。在这批部队的后面，据说还跟着一批马斯喀特苏丹的部队。
    同时，据路透社报道，英国驻中东空军总司令派奇今天也从巴林乘飞机前往马斯喀特（马斯喀特苏丹国的首府），同马斯喀特苏丹商谈关于英国空军在对阿曼起义者的镇压中的作用。
