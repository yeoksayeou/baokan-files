    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 12th: Zhao Puchu, Deputy Head of the Chinese Delegation, announced at the plenary session of the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament today that six Chinese people's organizations had donated 50,000 yuan in Renminbi to Japanese atomic and hydrogen bomb victims.

    The six organizations are the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, the Red Cross Society of China, the China Relief Association, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, and the All-China Youth Federation. In their letter to the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, they stated that the Chinese people deeply sympathize with the painful experiences of the Japanese people who have suffered several atomic bomb explosions and hydrogen bomb test disasters, and are particularly concerned about the health of the unfortunately affected Japanese brothers and sisters. Taking advantage of this conference, we would like to entrust the Chinese delegation attending the conference, on behalf of all the Chinese people, to send 50,000 yuan in Renminbi to your council as assistance and consolation to the Japanese nuclear weapons victims, and wish them a speedy recovery.

    In order to ban nuclear weapons and to safeguard world peace and human security, the Chinese people are willing to work together with the Japanese people and all peace-loving people in the world to strive unremittingly for this goal.

    Zhao Puchu handed the letter to Yasui Iku, Director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs. Yasui Iku, on behalf of the Japanese people, expressed his gratitude to the six Chinese organizations for their donation to the Japanese atomic and hydrogen bomb victims.
