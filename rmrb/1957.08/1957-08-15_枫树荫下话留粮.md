Talking About Grain Retention Under the Maple Tree Shade
	Shan Xiongfei

Beside the road in Laowuju, Third Team of Wuguang Cooperative in Pingjiang County, Hunan Province, there stands a large maple tree. In the scorching summer, the shade of the maple tree is a good place for people to rest and cool off.

Around mid-July, one morning, the members of the Third Team who were harrowing the fields were resting under the maple tree as usual. Among the six people sitting there was the team leader and cooperative committee member, Shan Dunshan.

These days, the village is publicizing the grain policy, and people like to talk about grain issues when they are together. The harrowers sitting at the foot of the maple tree naturally also talked about grain issues.

The first to open the conversation was a middle-peasant cooperative member in his thirties, Zeng Guisheng: "Last night, Comrade Huang from the work team said that this year we should retain 400 jin of rice per person according to the 'three fixings.' This won't work. My family has six people, three as big as me, an old man, and two small children, and they happen to eat so much. Last year, we were allocated 2,400 jin of rice and 600 jin of sweet potato shreds. By March, the rice bucket was empty. Later, we resold about 100 jin and bought more than 150 jin of black market grain to make it to the new harvest, leaving only a little over 100 jin of sweet potato shreds." He said to the team leader, Shan Dunshan, "Dunlao, this year you must raise an opinion with the cooperative that at least 500 jin of rice per person should be retained."

As soon as he finished speaking, poor-peasant cooperative member Shan Mingshan stood up, interjected his complete agreement, and added his family's grain consumption: "My family has four people, and the two children can't eat much grain at all, but from July last year to June this year, we ate a total of 2,100 jin of grain. This year the children are a year older and need more grain. Besides, our cooperative's grain production increases every year, and with more money, we should have more grain, eat more white rice, less sweet potato shreds, and improve our lives." After speaking, he also stared at the team leader, seemingly wanting him to agree to their request on the spot.

The others were drinking tea or smoking, and no one chimed in, but they were all frowning and thinking about something.

At this time, the team leader, Shan Dunshan, seemed very troubled. He lowered his head and said, "I don't think so, my family has enough grain to eat!" He pondered for a moment, and seemed to suddenly remember Peng Yaoxiang saying that he couldn't finish his grain, so he turned around and asked Peng Yaoxiang about his grain consumption.

This opened Yaoxiang's floodgates. He took a deep puff of his cigarette and began to talk incessantly: "My throat is bottomless, and there's no limit to how much I can eat. In the year 'Republic' 28, when the Japanese devils came, the grain was looted and burned, leaving nothing. Later, when the soldiers retreated, who could afford the 'grain merchants'' more than ten silver dollars per dan of rice! Didn't we just eat sweet potato porridge and wild grass for half a year. In 'Republic' 32, I worked eight mu of land for the landlord Huang Jichun and harvested more than twenty-four dan of rice, paid thirteen dan in rent, and had two dan left over. That year, my family of four ate this nine dan of rice half rice and half porridge. To compare that with eating grain after liberation is incomparable. Take last year, for example, five people were allocated 2,000 jin of rice, all of which was of high quality, and 500 jin of sweet potato shreds. We carefully planned and ate until June. Although the sweet potato shreds were gone, we still had a dan of rice." He said in a firm tone, "You don't believe it? I'm still eating old rice now."

These words sparked a debate. Zeng Guisheng and Shan Mingshan retorted in unison: The past is the past! The Communist Party is leading us to improve our lives! Besides, you have two old people in their fifties (referring to them and their spouses), how can they eat as much as we do!..."

Chen Qiusheng, a member of the Communist Youth League sitting behind Zeng Guisheng, stood up twice but couldn't interrupt their conversation. However, he couldn't bear it any longer and shouted, "Regardless of whether you're old or not, it's too unconscionable to say that the grain retention standard isn't enough to eat. My family's size is neither too big nor too small, why do we have enough to eat? It all depends on how you eat it. My mother is very strict, she doesn't use grain to feed pigs and chickens, nor does she make rice noodles as a dish. We often mix coarse grains and rice, and measure rice per person each time we cook. If there's leftover rice, we eat it at the next meal. In hot weather, we cook some porridge to adjust the taste, which also saves grain. We don't lack grain at all, and we still have fifty jin of old grain."

Another young man, Shan Weicao, because he was very familiar with Zeng Guisheng's situation, said with a reproachful tone while smiling, "That's the truth. You (toward Zeng Guisheng) only eat rice and don't eat coarse grains, trying to change the habit of eating coarse grains for thousands of years all at once, how can there be such a good thing! Your wife also makes grain into rice noodles and sweet potato slices, of course it's not enough to eat. Didn't Comrade Huang say that the country also has difficulties and is engaged in construction, what will the workers eat if we only care about retaining more grain?"

At this time, Peng Yaoxiang and Chen Qiusheng both stood up, picked up their straw hats they had been sitting on, and said, "We must think further ahead, not just think about ourselves. Only thinking about eating more grain ourselves, not saving where we should, is five hundred jin still not enough?"

Zeng Guisheng and Shan Mingshan followed behind them, their faces flushed with defeat, tacitly admitting that their ideas and practices were not right.

The sound of the harrowing drums rang out again.

    枫树荫下话留粮
    单雄飞
    湖南省平江县梧光社第三队老屋咀的大路旁边，有棵大枫树。夏日炎炎，枫树荫下是人们休息时歇凉的好地方。
    7月中旬一天的半上午，第三队扮禾的社员照例坐在枫树下歇息。在坐的六个人，其中有一个是队长兼社委单盾山。
    这几天，村里正在宣传粮食政策，人们在一起就爱谈论粮食问题。坐在枫树脚下的扮禾手们，自然也谈起了粮食问题。
    首先打开话匣子的是一个三十来岁的中农社员曾桂生：“昨晚工作组黄同志说，今年要按‘三定’每人留四百斤稻谷，这可不行。我家六口子，三个像我这么大的，一个老汉，两个细伢子，也偏偏吃得那么多。去年分得二千四百斤谷子，六百斤茴丝（即红薯丝），吃到3月间米桶就光了，后来补销了一百来斤，买了一百五十多斤黑市粮，才吃到接新，只剩了一百多斤茴丝。”他向着队长单盾山说，“盾老，今年你可要向社里提个意见，每人至少要留五百斤稻谷才行。”
    话刚说完，贫农社员单命山站了起来，插嘴表示完全赞同，并补充了他家的用粮情况：“我四口人，两个小孩根本吃不了多少粮，但从去年7月到今年6月，共吃了二千一百斤粮食，今年小孩大了一岁，需要的粮食就更多了。再说，我们社里的粮食年年增产，用的钱多了，粮食也该宽裕些，多吃点白米，少吃点茴丝，改善改善生活。”说完话，他也注视着队长，似乎要他当场答应他们的要求。
    别人呢，喝茶的喝茶，抽烟的抽烟，谁也没有搭腔，可是，都眼呆眉皱地在想着什么。
    这时，队长单盾山似乎很为难，他低着头说：“不见得吧，我家的粮食可是够吃了！”他又沉思了片刻，似乎忽然记起了彭瑶祥说过粮食吃不完的事，便转过身来，问彭瑶祥的用粮情况。
    这可打开了瑶祥的话筒。他深深地吸了一口烟，就滔滔不绝地谈开了：“喉咙万丈深，吃东西是没底的。‘民国’二十八年，日本鬼子来的那年，粮食抢的抢，烧的烧，搞个精光。后来兵退了，‘粮贩子’十多块光洋一担的谷，谁买得起！还不是吃了半年的茴粥和野草。‘民国’三十二年，我作了地主黄吉春八亩田，打了二十四担多谷，交了十三担租，完了二担粮。这一年我一家四口人就半饭半粥吃这九担谷子，要拿这同解放后吃粮来比较，真是比不得。就拿去年来说，五个人分了二千斤谷子，都是十粒五双的，还有五百斤茴丝，我们精打细算，吃到6月，虽然茴丝吃完了，谷子可还有担把。”他用坚定的口气说：“你们不相信？我如今还是吃的陈米饭。”
    这一席话，引起了一场争论。曾桂生、单命山异口同声地辩驳着：过去是过去的事呀！共产党领导我们改善生活啦！再说，你们有两个五十多岁（指他们两夫妇）的老头子，哪吃得赢我们这班人！……
    坐在曾桂生背后的共青团员陈秋生，两次站起来没有打得断他们的话。可是，他再也忍不住了，便高喊起来：“不管老不老，说留粮标准不够吃，是太没良心。我家的口子可不大不小，为什么都够吃了？这全看你怎样吃法。我妈手很紧，一不拿粮食喂猪养鸡，二不做米粉当菜，杂粮大米经常拌着吃，每次做饭按人下米，剩了饭，下餐再吃，热天煮点粥调调口味，又省了粮食，我们并不缺粮食，现在还有五十来斤陈粮。”
    另一个青年小伙子单韦曹，因为很熟悉曾桂生的情况，带着责备的口吻边笑边说：“这就是良心话，你们（向着曾桂生）光吃大米，不吃杂粮，想一下把几千年吃杂粮的习惯也改变了，哪有这样好的事！你老婆还把粮食做米丝、茴片，那当然不够吃。黄同志不是说过，国家也有困难，正在搞建设，我们只顾多留粮，工人们又吃什么？”
    这时，彭瑶祥、陈秋生都一起站了起来，一边捎起垫坐的草帽，一边说：“要想得远一点，不能光想自己。只想自己多吃粮，该省不省，五百斤还不够呵。”
    曾桂生、单命山跟在他们的后面，理输脸红，默认了自己的想法做法不对头。
    咚咚的扮桶声又响开了。
