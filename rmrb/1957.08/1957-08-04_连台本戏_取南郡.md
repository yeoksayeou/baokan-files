Stage and Screen

    The students of the China National Academy of Chinese Theatre Arts began their practical performance of the continuous opera "Taking Nan Commandery" this week. This is a famous series play from the Sanqing Troupe of the Qing Dynasty, which has not been performed for more than thirty years. This time, the students of the opera school are personally taught by Mr. Xiao Changhua, which has received widespread attention from people in the opera circle. The continuous opera is one of the traditional forms of Chinese opera. It is adapted from popular literary works familiar to the broad masses of the people and performed continuously according to the length of the subject matter. Therefore, the plot is relatively strong, so it has always been loved by the vast audience. However, recently some troupes have not selected the content of the continuous opera to be performed, and they often abuse the scenery, which destroys the plot. This practice should be opposed.

    连台本戏“取南郡”
    中国戏曲学校的学生在这一周开始实习演出连台本戏“取南郡”。这是清代三庆班的著名轴子戏，三十多年来没人上演。这次戏曲学校学生由萧长华先生亲自教授，受到戏曲界人士广泛的重视。连台本戏是我国戏曲传统的形式之一，它都是根据广大人民所熟悉的通俗文学作品改编，按题材的长短而连续演出，故事情节较强，因此一直为广大的观众所喜爱。但最近有些剧团对上演连台本戏的内容不加选择，而且往往滥用布景，破坏了剧情，这种作法则是应该反对的。　（匀）
