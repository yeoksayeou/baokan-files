Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, August 19th: An economic conference of American countries began on August 16th in Buenos Aires, the capital of Argentina. The conference is scheduled to last three weeks.

Four hundred representatives from twenty countries—the United States and nineteen Latin American countries—are attending this conference. Canada, as a member of the Western Hemisphere, is also participating in the discussions. In addition, seventeen non-Western Hemisphere countries have accepted invitations to attend the conference as observers, including Japan, India, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy, and the Nordic countries.

According to the decision of the preparatory meeting on August 15, the representatives will give priority to discussing the establishment of a Latin American common market. Many Latin American countries are concerned about the establishment of a common market by the six Western European countries and the increase in Western European trade with Africa, which has led to a decrease in Latin American exports to Western Europe. They also point out that Western European countries are replacing Latin America with Africa as a source of raw materials and are shifting capital from Latin America to Africa. Therefore, these countries also intend to establish a common market in Latin America to solve the problems they face.

From the perspective of further deepening the dependence of Latin American countries on the United States and excluding Western European competitors, the United States has expressed its willingness to support this proposal.

Many Latin American countries also want to use this conference to demand that the United States listen to their economic appeals. Because the United States has unilaterally manipulated prices, raised tariffs on imported goods, dumped agricultural products, and plundered Latin America through its investments, the economic crisis in many Latin American countries has deepened. Therefore, the discussion at the conference will involve these issues.

    美洲国家举行经济会议
    讨论建立共同市场和美国经济掠夺问题
    据新华社19日讯　布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：美洲国家经济会议8月16日起在阿根廷首都布宜诺斯艾利斯举行。会期预定三个星期。
    出席这次会议的有二十个国家——美国和十九个拉丁美洲国家——的四百名代表。加拿大作为西半球国家的一员也参加了讨论。此外有十七个非西半球国家接受邀请，以观察员身份出席会议，其中有日本、印度、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、南斯拉夫、西德、法国、英国、意大利和北欧国家。
    根据15日预备会议的决定，代表们将优先讨论关于建立拉丁美洲共同市场的问题。许多拉丁美洲国家对西欧六国组成共同市场和西欧国家对非洲贸易的增加促使拉丁美洲对西欧输出减少感到不安。它们还指出西欧国家正在以非洲来代替拉丁美洲作为原料供应地，同时把投向拉丁美洲的资本转而投向非洲。因此，这些国家也打算在拉丁美洲建立一个共同市场，来解决它们所面临的问题。
    美国方面从进一步加深拉丁美洲国家对美国的依赖和排挤西欧竞争者的愿望出发，表示准备支持这种主张。
    许多拉丁美洲国家还想通过这次会议，要求美国听取它们的经济呼声。由于美国一直片面地操纵价格，提高输入商品的关税，倾销农产品和通过它的投资在拉丁美洲进行掠夺，使许多拉丁美洲国家的经济危机加深，因此，会上讨论将牵涉到这些问题。
