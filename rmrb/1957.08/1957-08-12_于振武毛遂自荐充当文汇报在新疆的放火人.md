    Reporter Shen Shi reports from Urumqi for this newspaper: Recently, Xinjiang Daily has continuously exposed the reactionary words and deeds of rightist element Yu Zhenwu, who had infiltrated the Party. Yu Zhenwu was the deputy director of the Han Chinese editorial office of Xinjiang Daily. In early spring this year, when Fan Yan, a rightist element from Wenhui Daily, came to Xinjiang Daily intending to find special correspondents in Xinjiang, Yu Zhenwu volunteered to serve as a special correspondent for Wenhui Daily. When the bourgeois rightists launched a frantic attack on the Party and the government, he, as a special correspondent, started a fire for Wenhui Daily in Xinjiang. On May 26, the second page of Wenhui Daily prominently published a piece of "special dispatch from Urumqi," framed with a double line, titled "Hoping the Spring Breeze Will Reach Yumenguan Early." In this special dispatch, Yu Zhenwu said that "the atmosphere of 'blooming and contending' in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region has not yet normalized," and that "people in cultural, educational, scientific, and technological circles, seeing the large-scale 'blooming and contending' in various parts of China, feel that the breath of spring here is still not strong." In fact, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party was holding an enlarged meeting to discuss and arrange the rectification campaign based on Xinjiang's specific situation. Yu Zhenwu, taking advantage of his authority, arbitrarily convened several symposiums for educational and engineering technology circles in Urumqi in the name of the Xinjiang Daily editorial department. He advocated inviting people who usually had "many opinions" of the Party and "dared to raise sharp opinions" to participate in the symposiums, and insisted that the list "should not be negotiated with the leaders of each unit" to avoid "those who speak well of the Party coming." He took advantage of his position of being in charge of editing and publishing important news on the front page, and tried his best to select poisonous weeds. He emphasized that reports on "blooming and contending" should not mention achievements at all, and he deleted the parts that mentioned achievements in such稿件. In the above-mentioned special dispatch to Wenhui Daily, he also said venomously: "Recently, the Xinjiang newspaper office has begun to organize several symposiums for educational and engineering technology circles, and there has been some initial sound of blooming. However, some people who participated in the symposiums not only did not receive support but also heard cold remarks. And the news of the symposiums published in the newspapers also aroused the resentment of some leading comrades, who considered them one-sided; they even expressed dissatisfaction with the title 'Overthrow the walls of sectarianism and eliminate the artificial obstacles between the Party and non-Party members.' As a result, the masses have even greater concerns, and many people dare not speak." Yu Zhenwu also instructed the relevant groups in the editorial department and reporters in various places to start fires in rural areas, factories, mines, and universities, attempting to spread the fire to the grassroots level and throughout Xinjiang. He vehemently attacked the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint that advocated having a position and Party spirit when dealing with criticism, denouncing this viewpoint as "a seemingly correct but actually wrong theory of Party spirit." Within the editorial department, he often peddled the rightists' news viewpoints and "theories," echoing the idea of running a "collegial newspaper." Within the newspaper office, he often squeezed out and despised Deputy Editor-in-Chief Lang Ke and Office Director Chen Hua (who has now left his post for study). The exposed materials confirmed that Yu Zhenwu was a revolutionary traitor who surrendered and defected. In 1939, he was a clerk in a certain unit of the New Fourth Army. Later, at a critical moment in the struggle against the enemy, he deserted. After going to the KMT-controlled area, he requested the "Three People's Principles Youth League" to review him at a meeting of the League. After liberation, he concealed this ugly history and infiltrated the Party. The editorial department of Xinjiang Daily is continuing to expose his anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds.

    于振武毛遂自荐充当文汇报在新疆的放火人
    本报乌鲁木齐9日电　记者沈石报道：新疆日报最近以来连续揭发混进党内的右派分子于振武的反动言行。于振武是新疆日报汉文编辑室副主任，今年春初，文汇报右派分子范琰来新疆日报，企图在新疆物色特约记者时，于振武便毛遂自荐地充当了文汇报的特约记者。当资产阶级右派向党和政府猖狂进攻的时候，他以特约记者的身份，在新疆替文汇报放了一把火。5月26日，文汇报第二版用双线包框显著地刊登了一段“本报乌鲁木齐专讯”，标题是“希望春风早度玉门关”，于振武在这一则专讯中，说什么“新疆维吾尔自治区的鸣放空气还未正常化”，“文化、教育、科学技术界人士，看见关内各地大鸣大放，觉得这里春天的气息仍不浓。”实际上，中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会正在召开扩大会议，根据新疆的具体情况，讨论和布置整风。于振武利用自己的职权，擅自借新疆日报编辑部名义，在乌鲁木齐召开教育界、工程技术界几个座谈会，他主张要找平时对党“意见较多的，敢提尖锐意见的人”来参加座谈会，主张名单“不要和各单位的领导协商”，以免“替党说好话的人前来。”他利用负责掌握编发第一版重要新闻的便利条件，尽量选用毒草，他强调提出：报道鸣放的稿件，一律不讲成绩，他把这类稿件讲成绩的部分都删去。他在上述给文汇报的专讯中，还毒辣地说：“近来，新疆的报社开始组织教育界、工程技术界开了几个座谈会，初步有了鸣声。但是，有些人参加了座谈会不仅得不到支持，而且还听到冷言冷语。而报上发表的座谈会消息，也引起一些领导同志的反感，认为是片面；甚至对‘推倒宗派主义的墙，消除党与非党的人为障碍’的标题也表示不满，这样一来，群众的顾虑更大，许多人都不敢说话了。”于振武还布置编辑部有关各组和各地记者到农村、工矿、大专学校去点火，企图把火烧到基层，烧遍全疆。他竭力攻击主张对待批评要有立场要有党性的马列主义观点，他把这种观点污蔑为“似是而非的党性论”。他在编辑部内部经常贩卖右派的新闻观点和“理论”，附和办“同人报”的主张，他在报社内部，经常排挤和藐视副总编辑朗可和办公室主任陈华（现离职学习）。在揭发的材料中，证实于振武是一个自首变节的革命叛徒，1939年，他在新四军某部当文书，以后在对敌斗争的严重关头，他开了小差，到蒋管区后，他在一次伪三青团的会议上，请求“三青团”审查他，解放后，他隐瞒了这段丑恶历史，混入党内。新疆日报编辑部正继续揭露他的反党反社会主义的言行。
