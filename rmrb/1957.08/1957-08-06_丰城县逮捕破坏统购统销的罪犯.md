Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 4th -- The Public Security Bureau of Fengcheng County, Jiangxi Province, recently arrested Li Yuqi, a criminal who sabotaged the state's unified purchase and marketing of oil crops, in accordance with the law.

Li Yuqi was a former rogue and, at the time of his arrest, a member of the Pinghu Agricultural Cooperative in Santang Township. From October of last year to June of this year, he successively acquired over 10,000 jin of sesame and over 100 jin of peanuts through illegal means. He also privately slaughtered seven pigs and one calf, from which he repeatedly obtained exorbitant profits. The Township People's Committee had repeatedly educated him about his illegal behavior of sabotaging the state's unified purchase and marketing and undermining the state's price policy, but not only did he not change, he secretly gathered backward masses for meetings, inciting them, and even threatened to beat people. Li Yuqi's speculative activities caused losses to the state. The Fengcheng County Public Security Bureau investigated his criminal behavior, determined that the evidence was conclusive, and recently arrested him in accordance with the law with the approval of relevant authorities.

    丰城县逮捕破坏统购统销的罪犯
    新华社南昌4日电　江西省丰城县公安局最近依法逮捕了破坏国家油料统购统销的犯罪分子李玉祈。
    李玉祈过去是流氓，逮捕时是三塘乡萍湖农业社的社员。从去年10月到今年6月，他先后共套购了一万多斤芝麻、一百多斤花生，还私宰生猪七头，小黄牛一头，从中多次取得暴利。乡人民委员会对他这种破坏国家统购统销、破坏国家价格政策的犯法行为，曾多次进行过教育，但是他不但不改，反而秘密笼络落后群众开会，进行煽动，还扬言要打人。李玉祈的投机活动，使国家受到了损失。丰城县公安局对他的犯罪行为进行了侦查，认为罪证确凿，经有关机关批准最近将他依法逮捕。
