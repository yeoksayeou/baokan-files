Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, August 19th: Oman's Imam's representative in Cairo, Harsey, said on the 18th that Omani nationalist forces are continuing to fight against the invaders.

Harsey announced that he had received a telegram from Oman saying that on the 17th, the rebels defeated 2,000 troops of the Sultan of Muscat near Sahama village, annihilating 200 of them.

He also said that the nationalists are still "holding their positions in Izki."

On the 17th, Harsey showed reporters a photocopy of the Treaty of Seeb signed by the Sultan of Muscat and the Imam of Oman in 1920. The treaty contained provisions regarding mutual non-interference in internal affairs, extradition of criminals, and a tariff rate of no more than 5% on goods transported from Oman to Muscat.

In order to deny Oman's independent status, Britain has been trying to conceal this treaty. The British Foreign Office recently excused itself by saying that the Sultan of Muscat decided not to publish the treaty.

    阿曼起义者继续战斗
    近日在萨哈马村附近打了一场胜仗
    据新华社开罗19日电　阿曼教长驻开罗代表哈尔塞18日说，阿曼民族主义部队正在继续对侵略者进行战斗。
    哈尔塞宣布，他收到从阿曼发来的电报说，起义者17日在萨哈马村附近击败了马斯喀特苏丹的二千名军队，歼灭了其中的二百人。
    他还说，民族主义者仍旧“坚守着他们在伊兹基的阵地”。
    哈尔塞在17日向新闻记者显示了马斯喀特苏丹同阿曼教长在1920年签订的西卜条约的影印本。条约中有关于双方互不干涉内政、引渡罪犯、从阿曼运往马斯喀特的商品关税率不超过5％等各项规定。
    英国为了否认阿曼的独立地位，企图把这项条约掩盖起来。英国外交部最近推托说，马斯喀特苏丹决定不公布这项条约。
