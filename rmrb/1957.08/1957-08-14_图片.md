The agricultural cooperatives in the Jiangjin Special District of Sichuan Province are not only focused on the field management of mid-season and late-season rice, but also paying attention to striving for a bumper harvest of other grain crops. The Minguang No. 1 Cooperative of Degan Township, Jiangjin County, has drawn a portion of its labor force to work on the cooperative's more than 200 mu of sweet potato fields for inter-tillage and weeding.
