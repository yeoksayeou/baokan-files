　　“U.S. Aid” is a Good Business
　　American Newspaper Reveals the Truth About U.S. "Foreign Aid"
    (Our Report) Washington Dispatch: U.S. government officials have always described American "foreign aid" as a "generous assistance" to other countries. Recently, a New York Times editorial and a small column in the Washington Post provided some good annotations to this "generosity."
      The New York Times published an editorial on August 20 entitled "Gambling with Security," which wrote: "Contrary to popular impression, economic 'foreign aid' is mainly not dollars, but the goods we export. This export of goods is beneficial to expanding our overseas markets and maintaining our prosperity. Our military assistance has also helped develop local defense forces. These forces not only defend their own countries, but also defend the United States at a cost that is much cheaper than providing a similar defense force in our own country. ... This is indeed a good deal."
    The "Washington Whirligig" column in the Washington Post on August 18 contained a small column by Drew Pearson which wrote:
      "Former Ambassador to India and former Governor of Connecticut, Chester Bowles, spoke to the House Foreign Affairs Committee a few days ago about the Prime Minister of Monaco's request for $10 million in Marshall Plan aid.
    The Prime Minister was asked, 'Tell us, what about the Communist problem in Monaco?'
    He replied: 'We don't have any Communists there.'
    The person in charge of the Marshall Plan said: 'No Communists!' 'Then how do you expect us to give you aid? If you don't have Communists, we can't go to Congress to ask for aid to Monaco.'"
    This shows that in the eyes of American capitalists, "foreign aid" is a very worthwhile business. And in order to do this business well, they need to create the so-called "Communist threat."

### “美援”是一笔好生意　美报透露美国“援外”真相

　　“美援”是一笔好生意
　　美报透露美国“援外”真相
    本报讯　华盛顿消息：美国政府的官员们一向把美国的“援外”行动称作是一种对其他国家的“慷慨援助”。最近“纽约时报”的一篇社论和“华盛顿邮报”的一条小专栏为这种“慷慨”作了一些很好的注解。
      “纽约时报”8月20日发表了一篇题为“用安全作赌博”的社论，其中写道：“同一般人的印象相反，经济“援外”主要不是美元，而是我们输出的商品。这种商品输出对于扩张我们在海外的市场和维持我们的繁荣是有利的。我们的军事援助也已经帮助发展了当地的国防部队。这些部队不仅保卫了它们自己的国家，并且以比在我们国内提供一支类似的防御部队的费用要便宜得多的代价保卫了美国。……这的确是一笔好买卖。”
    8月18日“华盛顿邮报”的“华盛顿的形形色色”栏内登载的德鲁·皮尔逊的一条小专栏里面写道：
      “前驻印度大使和前康?狄格州长切斯特·鲍尔士几天前向众议院外交委员会谈了关于摩纳哥首相要求一千万美元的马歇尔计划援款的情况。
    首相被问道，‘告诉我们，摩纳哥的共产党问题怎么样？’
    他回答说：‘我们那里没有共产党。’
    主持马歇尔计划的人说：‘没有共产党！’‘那你怎么指望我们给你援助呢？如果你们没有共产党，我们就无法到国会去要求给摩纳哥援助。’”
    从此看出，在美国资本家的眼中，“援外”是一笔很划算的生意。而为了做好这笔生意，他们需要制造所谓“共产党的威胁”。
