Korean Dance Art
Kim Seung-gu, Director of the Art Bureau of the Ministry of Culture and Propaganda of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea

　　Korean dance art has a long tradition. The Book of the Later Han Dynasty records the Buyeo era (1300 BC): "Buyeo held a grand sacrificial ceremony to heaven in the twelfth lunar month, drinking, singing, and dancing for days, called 'Welcoming the Drums.'" This illustrates that as early as 3,200 years ago, there was a folk-created song and dance form called "Welcoming the Drums."

　　The development of Korean dance art, like the development of all national arts, has been closely linked to the people's production activities since ancient times. One of the most common dance arts in Korea, the Farmers' Dance, expresses the farmers' joy at collective labor and harvest in the fields. As the Chronicle of the Three Kingdoms of Chen Shou, Eastern Barbarians - Korea - Biography records: "When the sowing season arrives in May, the masses sing, dance, and drink day and night without rest; the dance involves dozens of people, rising and following each other, stomping the ground up and down, with feet corresponding to the ox's hooves, and the Zheng music resembles the Tuo dance; the same is repeated in October after the agricultural work is completed." The time and form of this dance are similar to modern Farmers' Dance.

　　Mask dances depicting life during the hunting period have also been passed down to modern times as an important tradition of Korean folk dance, such as the Lion Dance in Bukcheong, Hamgyongnam-do, which has existed since ancient times, and the mask dances of Bongsan in Hwanghae-do.

　　Court dances originating from religious rituals and patriotic dances resisting foreign invaders are also major traditional Korean dances. The former is represented by the Cheoyongmu dance created during the Silla period, which is based on the legend of the marriage relationship between King Heongang, the 49th ruler of Silla (875-886 AD), and the Dragon King of the East Sea; the latter is represented by the Sword Dance created during the Silla period, which tells the historical story of the patriot Gwanchang entering Baekje, dancing with his sword in front of the king, and seizing the opportunity to assassinate the king. The Cheoyongmu dance developed into a large group dance of eighty-eight people during the Joseon Dynasty. Together with the Farmers' Dance, composed of lively and optimistic rhythms, and the mask dance with its varied movements, it has become a basic characteristic tradition that forms modern Korean dance and is inherited and developed.

　　Korean dance art, with its long historical tradition, began to decline in the late Joseon Dynasty under the incompetence and brutal rule of the feudal ruling class. Artists with highly national classical artistic talents wandered the streets and local markets, forced to live like beggars. This situation was further aggravated during the Japanese occupation of Korea. Due to the Japanese invaders' policy of eradicating national culture, both class-content and nationally-formed art faced the fate of being eliminated. However, this tragic situation of Korean national art was fundamentally changed after liberation.

　　Under the literary and artistic policies and various measures of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic's government, many achievements have been made in dance, along with the rapid development of our national culture and art.

　　In the field of dance art, the Choe Seung-hee Dance Institute, the Jeong Ji-soo Dance Institute, and the Classical Art Institute were established, and folk artists from the central and local areas were invited to discover and organize classical art, with particular emphasis on promoting the development of folk dance.

　　At the time of liberation, there were only a few artistic directors in the dance department, but now there are more than 600 dance art directors belonging to the Choe Seung-hee Dance Theater, the National Art Theater, the National Folk Art Theater, and more than ten local art troupes. In addition, the National Dance School also trains 50 new talents every year to replenish the ranks of dance artists. Thanks to these newly trained dance artists, the ranks of members of various professional groups, instructors of factory and rural art groups, and dance teachers at all levels of schools have been expanded.

　　The Choe Seung-hee Dance Theater has cultivated many dance artists, discovered and inherited our country's dance heritage, creatively applied advanced dance techniques, and continuously developed our national dance. For example, our country's first dance drama "Midnight Moonlit Castle Tune," "The Story of Sado Castle," "Under the Clear Sky," "Dance Dedicated to General Kim Il-sung," "Breaking Through the Waves," "Korean Mother," "Rhythm and Dance," "Elegant Woman's Dance," and many other dance pieces and short dramas. The Choe Seung-hee Dance Troupe continued to train new talents and expand the ranks of Korean dance artists in the flames of the Fatherland Liberation War, and created the one-act dance drama "Korean Mother," "Song of Peace," and many other dance works, the performance of which strengthened the patriotic ideology of the Korean people who rose up to defend the Fatherland and their hatred of the enemy. During the post-war recovery and reconstruction period, the dance troupe performed new dance dramas and dances, such as "The Story of Sado Castle" and "Under the Clear Sky."

　　Ahn Sung-hee is an outstanding young Korean dancer who enriched her talent while studying at the Moscow Dance School. On the basis of Korean dance, she creatively absorbed the techniques of Russian ballet and established her own new dance system. Her performances of "Gypsy Dance," "Oath," "Sword Dance," etc., after returning to China, were well received by the audience.

　　The Jeong Ji-soo Dance Institute has trained many dancers since liberation and directed the first performance of Russian ballet in Korea. The ballet and opera "Flower Shoes," "People of Eagle Valley," "Jinlan's Moon," and the dance part of "The Flag on the Highlands," created and performed by the National Art Theater Dance Troupe under his guidance, are significant works in Korean modern dance.

　　Because the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic's government's literary and art policy focuses on excavating and developing excellent folk dances that were weakened by the destruction of Japanese imperialists, Farmers' Dance, Bongsan Mask Dance, and Lion Dance have been restored. In the feudal era, many class contents of these dances had been weakened due to the oppression of the ruling class. At present, Farmers' Dance has become an important program in the activities of rural areas, cultural and entertainment groups of various production units, and professional art troupes.

　　In the process of implementing the Party's policy on developing national dance, our dance artists have also unearthed unique folk dances that have been passed down only through legends, such as the Hand Clapping Dance and the "Don Dolari Dance." The Hand Clapping Dance was taught to young dancers by an old farmer in his seventies based on his memory. It is said to be a dance from the Joseon Dynasty that soldiers performed during their rest time to satirize the feudal bureaucratic group. The "Don Dolari Dance" was a folk dance that was popular in Hamgyong Province for a long time in the past, but by the end of the 19th century, people lost interest in dancing this dance due to difficult living conditions, and it stopped. After liberation, young men and women in Hamgyong Province began to dance this dance again as entertainment during rest, and now dance troupes also regard it as an important performance program.

　　Currently, our young dancers, choreographers, and directors are visiting various places to excavate various excellent folk dances and refine and develop them.

　　The Korean Workers' Party and the Republic's government's policy on developing national art emphasizes learning advanced culture and art from the Soviet Union and China. The dance dramas "The Story of Sado Castle," "Under the Clear Sky," etc., and the dance parts in the operas "Flower Shoes" and "Jinlan's Moon" have brought into play the inherent traditions and rhythms of Korean national dance, while absorbing the dance techniques of the people of the Soviet Union and other countries. In particular, learning the excellent dance art of the Soviet Union has had a huge impact on the development of our country's dance art. The scenes of "Swan Lake," "Youth," "My Pigeon," "Death of the Swan," and "Fountain of Tears" performed by dancers who returned from studying in the Soviet Union have also helped enrich and develop Korean national dance.

　　Our dance artists have also actively participated in international exchanges in dance art. Our dance troupe has participated in the World Youth and Student Festival five times in a row, and has visited and performed in the Soviet Union and various fraternal countries and other countries, which has played a great role in widely introducing our national dance to the people of these countries and learning the excellent dance art of these countries.

　　According to the literary and art policies of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic's government, our dance artists are working hard to inherit and develop our glorious dance tradition and absorb advanced dance techniques from other countries in order to further develop our country's dance art.

### 朝鲜的舞蹈艺术

　　朝鲜的舞蹈艺术
　　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国文化宣传省艺术局局长　金承久
    朝鲜的舞蹈艺术是有着悠久的传统的。后汉书关于扶余时代（公元前一千三百年）记载：“扶余以腊月祭天大会，连日饮酒歌舞名曰迎鼓。”这说明了早在三千二百多年以前就有了民间创造的名曰
  “迎鼓”的歌舞形式。
    朝鲜舞蹈艺术的发展也和一切民族艺术的发展过程一样，是从遥远的古代起就同人民的生产活动密切地联系在一起的。朝鲜最普遍的舞蹈艺术之一——农乐舞表现了农民对田野上的集体劳动和丰收的喜悦。如陈寿的三国志东夷——朝鲜——传记载：“以五月下种记，群众歌舞饮酒，昼夜无休；其舞数十人，俱起相随，踏地低仰，牛足相应，郑奏有似铎舞；十月农功毕，亦复如之。”这种舞蹈的时间和形式，同现代农乐舞相似。
    描写狩猎时期生活的假面舞也流传到现代，为朝鲜民间舞蹈的重要传统，如咸镜南道北青自古以来就有的狮子舞，黄海道凤山地方的假面舞等。
    源由于宗教仪式的宫中舞蹈和反抗外来侵略者的爱国主义的舞蹈也是朝鲜现代主要传统的舞蹈。前者可以新罗时代所创造的处容舞为代表，这是新罗第四十九代王宪康王（公元八百七十五年——八百八十六年）和东海龙王之间的姻缘关系的传说；后者可以新罗时代创造的剑舞为代表，这是当时的爱国者官昌进入百济，在王面前拔剑而舞，窥机刺死王的历史故事。处容舞到李朝时代发展成为八十八人的大型群舞，它同以活泼、乐天的律动构成的农乐舞和动作变化多端的假面舞，都成为形成现代朝鲜舞蹈的基本特征的传统，被继承发展下来的。
    有着悠久的历史传统的朝鲜舞蹈艺术，到李朝末期在封建统治阶级的无能和凶暴统治下开始衰退下来，有着高度的民族古典艺术才能的艺术家们，仿徨于街头和地方的集市上，不得不过着乞丐般的生活。这种情况到日本侵略者强占朝鲜时期尤为加深。由于日本侵略者的民族文化消灭政策，无论是有着阶级内容的或者是民族形式的，均濒于被消灭的命运。但是，朝鲜民族艺术的这样悲惨情况，在解放以后，得到了根本的改变。
    在朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府的文艺政策和各种措施下，伴随着我国民族文化艺术的急速发展，在舞蹈方面取得了许多成就。
    舞蹈艺术方面，创立了崔承喜舞蹈研究所、郑志树舞蹈研究所和古典艺术研究所，并聘请中央和各地方的民间艺人，以发现和整理古典艺术，特别着重推进发展民间舞蹈。
    刚解放时，舞蹈部门的艺术指导者只有几人，而如今属于崔承喜舞蹈剧场、国立艺术剧场和国立民族艺术剧场以及十余所地方各艺术团体的舞蹈艺术指导者就有六百多名。此外，国立舞蹈学校每年还培养出五十名新人，补充舞蹈艺术家的队伍。由于这些新培养出来的舞蹈艺术家，各专业团体的成员和工厂、农村艺术小组的指导者以及各级学校的舞蹈教员的阵营，得以扩大。
    崔承喜舞蹈剧场培养出了许多舞蹈艺术家，发掘和继承了我国的舞蹈遗产，创造性的运用先进舞蹈技术，不断地发展了我们的民族舞蹈。例如：我国的第一个舞剧“半夜月城曲”、“沙道城的故事”、“在晴朗的天空下”、“献给金日成将军之舞”、“冲破风浪”、“朝鲜的母亲”、“拍子和舞”、“优美的女人舞”等许多舞蹈小曲和短剧。崔承喜舞蹈团在祖国战争的火焰中继续培养新人，扩大朝鲜舞蹈艺术工作者的队伍，并创作了短幕舞剧“朝鲜的母亲”“和平之歌”和其他许多舞蹈作品，这些作品的演出加强了奋起捍卫祖国的朝鲜人民的爱国主义思想和对敌人的憎恨心。在战后恢复重建时期，这个舞蹈团演出了新的舞剧和舞蹈。例如“沙道城的故事”和“在晴朗的天空下”。
    安圣姬是朝鲜优秀的年轻的舞蹈家，她在莫斯科舞蹈学校进修期间丰富了自己的才华。她是在朝鲜舞蹈的基础上，创造性地吸收俄罗斯巴蕾舞的技巧，树立了自己的新的舞蹈体系。她回国后表演的“吉卜赛舞”“宣誓”“剑舞”等受到了观众的良好评价。
    郑志树舞蹈研究所在解放后培养了不少舞蹈家，并在朝鲜首次指导俄罗斯巴蕾舞的演出。他所指导的国立艺术剧场舞蹈团创作和演出的巴蕾舞和歌剧“花鞋”、“鹰谷的人们”、“锦兰之月”中的舞蹈部分和“高地上的旗帜”等，是在朝鲜的现代舞蹈中有重要意义的作品。
    因为朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府的文艺政策着重于挖掘和发展由于日本帝国主义者的摧残而衰退的优秀的民间舞蹈，所以农乐舞、凤山假面舞和狮子舞等都恢复了。这些舞蹈在封建时代由于统治阶级的抑压，有不少的阶级内容曾经被削弱了。目前，农乐舞在农村、各生产单位的文娱组和专业的艺术团体的活动中成为重要节目。
    我国的舞蹈艺术工作者们在实现党关于发展民族舞蹈的政策的过程中，还挖掘出只依靠传说而传播下来的奇特的民间舞蹈，例如手拍舞和“顿道拉利舞”。手拍舞是一位七十多岁的老农民根据他的记忆，教给年轻的舞蹈家的，相传是李朝时代的士兵们在休息时间跳的讽刺封建官僚集团的舞蹈。“顿道拉利舞”是过去在咸镜道长期流行的民间舞蹈，但是到十九世纪末叶，人民由于生活困难而没有兴趣跳这个舞，它就停顿下来了。解放后咸镜道的青年男女又开始跳起这个舞来，作为休息时的娱乐，现在舞蹈团体也把它当作重要的演出节目。
    目前，我国的年青的舞蹈家、编舞家和导演们巡访各地发掘出各种优秀的民间舞蹈，并加以提炼和发展。
    朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府关于发展民族艺术的政策是强调学习苏联和中国等先进文化艺术的。舞剧“沙道城的故事”、“在晴朗的天空下”等和歌剧“花鞋”“锦兰之月”中的舞蹈部分是发挥了朝鲜民族舞蹈固有的传统和律动，同时吸收了苏联等其他国家人民的舞蹈技巧。特别是，学习苏联的优秀的舞蹈艺术，对于发展我国的舞蹈艺术起了巨大的影响。到苏联留学回来的舞蹈家表演的“天鹅舞”“青春”“我的鸽子”“天鹅之死”“眼泪的喷泉”等的场面也是有助于朝鲜民族舞蹈的丰富和发展的。
    我国舞蹈艺术家还积极参加了舞蹈艺术的国际交流工作。我国舞蹈团曾经一连五次参加世界青年学生联欢节，并在苏联和各兄弟国家以及其他国家进行了访问演出，这对于把我们的民族舞蹈广泛地介绍给这些国家人民和学习这些国家优秀的舞蹈艺术方面，起了很大的作用。
    我国的舞蹈艺术工作者，根据朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府的文艺政策，正在为继承和发展我们光辉的舞蹈传统和吸收其它国家先进的舞蹈技巧，以便进一步发展我国的舞蹈艺术而努力。
