The "Petőfi Club" of the Zhang-Luo Alliance
By our correspondents Liu Shiping and Mu Yang

During Zhang Bojun's confession of the reactionary activities of the "Zhang-Luo Alliance," someone asked: "Did you want to turn the Cultural Club into a Petőfi Club?"

Zhang Bojun replied: "If we hadn't been defeated today, it might have become a Petőfi Club."

So, what exactly were the Zhang-Luo Alliance's intentions and conspiratorial activities concerning the Political Consultative Conference's Cultural Club?

According to Shi Gongzai, the director of the Cultural Club: As early as the autumn of 1955, Luo Longji, using the excuse of improving the club's services, asked Shi Gongzai and others to solicit opinions from Zhang Bojun, Zhang Naiqi, and others. At that time, Zhang Bojun proposed: "The club's service target should include professors from universities in Beijing's urban and suburban areas, as well as intellectuals from other fields." Changing the nature of the Cultural Club was an important step in attempting to turn it into a Petőfi Club.

Although Shi Gongzai was unable to see through this conspiracy at the time, he insisted on the principle that only members of the National Committee of the CPPCC, leading cadres of democratic parties, and heads of people's organizations participating in the CPPCC could be members. Therefore, the club did not become a club for university professors and other intellectuals.

After the completion of the National CPPCC building last year, in order to streamline the organizational structure and enrich the activities of the CPPCC building, the leadership advocated handing over the Cultural Club's premises. However, Luo Longji firmly opposed this proposal, arguing that there were three democratic parties—the China Democratic League, the China National Democratic Construction Association, and the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang—in the Dongcheng district, and these parties' cadres needed a place for cultural and recreational activities. As a result, the Cultural Club was not separated out, and Luo Longji took the opportunity to take it over, becoming the chairman of the management committee.

Was Luo Longji really thinking about the cadres of the democratic parties' organizations? Of course not. Just one example is enough to prove it. Originally, cadres of the democratic parties' organizations could use club passes to participate in various activities at the Cultural Club. However, Luo Longji changed this to issuing dance tickets to cadres once every two weeks, and they were not allowed to participate in club activities at other times. This caused dissatisfaction among the cadres of the democratic parties' organizations, who sent representatives to protest. Shi Gongzai reported this situation to Luo Longji, who did not take it seriously. When Shi Gongzai insisted on changing this practice, Luo Longji reluctantly agreed.

However, Luo Longji did not abandon his plan. When developing membership, he refused to admit Communist Party members and progressives. When studying the scope of issuing membership cards, the initial draft included the heads and deputy heads and secretaries of various people's organizations. Luo Longji firmly opposed this. Hu Keshi, secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, applied for a membership card several times but was refused by Luo Longji. On the other hand, for those who harbored dissatisfaction with the Communist Party, even if they had no connection with the CPPCC, as long as they applied, Luo Longji would quickly issue them membership cards. For example, the rightist Chen Tiqiang applied in the morning, and Luo Longji instructed that a membership card be issued in the afternoon. On the same morning, Luo Longji told the Cultural Club staff: "We should stop issuing membership cards."

Although Luo Longji's goal of transforming the Cultural Club into a club for intellectuals was not realized, he and Zhang Bojun had already begun to use the club to organize activities against the leadership of the Communist Party and against socialism. On June 6th, Zhang Bojun convened the Beijing Six Professors Conference at the club, discussing how to create a "Hungarian incident" in China. Zhang Bojun also moved the China Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party's office meetings to the Cultural Club. It is known that from early May to early June, the China Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party held two office meetings and nine forums at the Cultural Club. These meetings were all about discussing how to ignite trouble. In addition to members of the China Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, non-members also participated in these meetings. Li Wanchun, who ignited trouble in the Peking opera circle, and Li Zong'en, who took the lead in the Western medicine field, both attended the meetings.

Before Zhang Bojun's reactionary "generals" Wang Yifan, Zhang Yunchuan, Wang Jiyi, Yang Yitang, and others went to the Northeast, Shandong, Henan, Hebei, and other places to start trouble, Zhang Bojun held banquets at the Cultural Club to send them off.

Just as Luo Longji and Zhang Bojun were rampantly carrying out their activities, the people of the whole country launched a counterattack against their offensive, and the Cultural Club was prevented from becoming a Petőfi Club.

    章罗联盟的“裴多菲俱乐部”
    本报记者　刘时平　穆扬
    在章伯钧交代“章罗联盟”的反动活动时，曾经有人问：“是不是想把文化俱乐部变成裴多菲俱乐部”？
    章伯钧回答说：“今天要不是打下来，可能变成裴多菲俱乐部。”
    那末章罗联盟到底对政协文化俱乐部有些什么企图，干了些甚么阴谋勾当？
    据文化俱乐部的主任史公载谈：早在1955年秋季，罗隆基就以改进俱乐部业务为借口，要史公载等向章伯钧、章乃器等征求意见。当时，章伯钧提出：“俱乐部的服务对象，应包括北京市区和郊区各大学教授和其他方面的大知识分子。”改变文化俱乐部的性质，是企图把文化俱乐部变成裴多菲俱乐部的一个重要步骤。
    当时史公载虽然还没有能够识破这个阴谋，但是坚持了只有全国政协和各民主党派的委员、党派干部，以及参加政协的各人民团体的负责人才能作成员这个原则。因此这个俱乐部没有变成为各大学教授和其他大知识分子的俱乐部。
    去年全国政协大楼建成后，为了精简机关编制和充实政协大楼的活动内容，领导方面主张把文化俱乐部房屋交出去。但是罗隆基坚决反对这一主张，理由是：在东城，就有民盟、民建、民革三个党派，要给这些党派机关的干部有一个文化娱乐活动的场所。文化俱乐部也就没有分出去，罗隆基还乘此机会，把俱乐部要到自己手里，当上了管理委员会的主任委员。
    罗隆基真为各民主党派机关干部着想吗？当然不是。这里只举一个例子就足以证明。原来各民主党派机关的干部可以拿俱乐部出入证参加文化俱乐部的各项活动。但是，罗隆基改为每两周给干部们发一次舞会票，其他时间就不许干部到俱乐部去活动。这件事引起了各民主党派机关干部的不满，曾经推派代表提出抗议。史公载把这一情况汇报给罗隆基，罗隆基听了不以为然。史公载坚持要改变那种作法的时候，罗隆基才勉强同意。
    但是罗隆基并没有放弃自己的计划，在发展会员时，拒绝吸收共产党员和进步分子，在研究发会员证的范围的时候，初拟的草案中包括各人民团体的正副负责人和书记。罗隆基坚决反对。共产主义青年团中央书记处书记胡克实曾数次申请发给他会员证，也都被罗隆基拒绝。而对一些对共产党心怀不满的人，即或这些人和政协毫无关系，只要申请，罗隆基就很快发给会员证。比如右派分子陈体强上午申请，下午罗隆基就指令发给会员证。就在这一天的上午，罗隆基还对俱乐部的工作人员说：“应该停止发会员证了。”
    罗隆基企图把文化俱乐部改变成大知识分子俱乐部的目的虽然没有实现，但是他和章伯钧已经开始利用这个俱乐部，组织反对共产党领导、反对社会主义活动。6月6日，章伯钧就在这个俱乐部召开了北京六教授会议，谈论在中国制造一次“匈牙利事件”。章伯钧把农工民主党的办公会议，也搬到文化俱乐部开。据已经知道的在5月上旬到6月上旬，农工民主党在文化俱乐部召开了两次办公会议和九次座谈会。这些会议都是讨论点火问题的。参加这些会议的人，除了农工民主党的成员外，还有非农工民主党成员。在京剧界点火的李万春和在西医界挂帅的李宗恩都参加了会议。
    章伯钧的反动“大将”王一帆、张云川、王寄一、杨逸棠等到东北、山东、河南、河北等地去放火前，章伯钧就在文化俱乐部为这些人设宴饯行。
    就在罗隆基和章伯钧猖狂活动的时候，全国人民对他们的进攻展开了反击，这个文化俱乐部才没有变成为裴多菲俱乐部。
