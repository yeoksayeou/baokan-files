Socialist Education in Rural Areas Across the Country
	◇Shaanxi: Since the summer harvest this year, some unhealthy tendencies have emerged in many places. The spread of right-wing reactionary remarks in rural areas has resonated with some anti-socialist elements in the countryside. Therefore, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently instructed party organizations at all levels to immediately conduct a large-scale socialist education campaign among the broad masses of peasants, resolutely crack down on the reactionary activities of illegal landlords, rich peasants, and bad elements, and bring those who should be dealt with according to the law to justice. Organized counter-revolutionary activities should be quickly investigated and solved, and public trials or announcements should be held to educate the masses.
	◇Liaoning: The Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Liaoning Provincial People's Committee jointly issued instructions requiring all rural areas in the province to universally carry out a socialist propaganda and education campaign during the slack season.
	The instructions stated: Propaganda should be linked to the specific circumstances of the local area, focusing on positive education, exposing and refuting the reactionary remarks and rumors of landlords, rich peasants, and remaining counter-revolutionary elements in some rural areas. At the same time, attention should be paid to distinguishing between reactionary remarks and the backward thinking of some backward peasants, and preventing grassroots cadres from indiscriminately labeling people.
	◇Jilin: The current rural order is basically healthy, but due to the influence of the reactionary words and deeds of right-wing elements, remaining counter-revolutionary elements and illegal landlord and rich peasant elements are taking the opportunity to engage in activities and disrupt rural order. In Longkeng Township, Qian Gorlos Mongolian Autonomous County, a rich peasant forcibly took away a cooperative's horse and threatened to kill people with a knife; some bad elements indiscriminately felled state forests, and incidents of murder and arson have occurred in some places. Some well-to-do middle peasants are colluding to withdraw from cooperatives. The Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Committee recently issued joint instructions requiring all localities to conduct a thorough socialist ideological education campaign during the slack season.
	◇Shandong: A large-scale socialist education campaign will soon be launched in all rural areas of Shandong Province. The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has issued instructions stating that before the autumn harvest this year, all localities should concentrate their efforts on carrying out a campaign among the broad masses of cadres, party members, League members, and peasants to criticize right-leaning opportunist ideas within the Party, criticize capitalist and individualist ideas, and crack down on the counter-revolutionary activities of landlords and rich peasants, in order to achieve a bumper autumn harvest and complete the grain procurement tasks. As for disaster areas, the focus should remain on production for disaster relief, while integrating socialist ideological education.

    社会主义教育在各地农村
    ◇陕西　在今年夏收以来，有不少地方出现了一些歪风邪气。右派反动言论在农村的传播，引起了农村中一些反社会主义分子的共鸣。因此，中共陕西省委最近指示各地党组织必须立即对广大农民进行一次大规模的社会主义教育，要坚决打击不法地主、富农和坏分子的反动行为，该法办的必须法办。对那些有组织的反革命活动应该迅速查清破案，并且公开宣判或宣布，以教育群众。
    ◇辽宁　中共辽宁省委和辽宁省人民委员会联合发出指示，要求全省农村在挂锄期间，普遍开展一次社会主义宣传教育活动。
    指示说：宣传时要联系当地的具体情况，着重进行正面教育，揭发和驳斥一些农村中的地主、富农、残余反革命分子的反动言论和谣言，同时，要注意分清反动言论和某些落后农民某些落后思想的界限，防止基层干部乱戴帽子。
    ◇吉林　当前农村秩序基本上是健康的，但是由于右派分子反动言行的影响，残余反革命分子和不法地主富农分子乘机活动，扰乱农村秩序。前郭尔罗斯蒙古族自治县龙坑乡有个富农硬把合作社的马牵走，并持刀扬言要杀人；有的坏分子乱伐国家森林，个别地方还发生杀人放火的事件。一些富裕中农串连退社。中共吉林省委和省人民委员会在最近发出联合指示，要求各地在挂锄期间进行一次深入的社会主义思想教育。
    ◇山东　大规模的社会主义教育，即将在山东全省农村中展开。中共山东省委已发出指示，指示说，在今年秋收以前，各地要集中力量向广大干部、党、团员和农民群众进行一次批判党内右倾机会主义思想，批判资本主义和个人主义思想，打击地主、富农的反革命行为，以实现秋季大丰收和完成粮食征购任务。至于灾区仍以生产救灾为中心，并把社会主义思想教育结合起来。
