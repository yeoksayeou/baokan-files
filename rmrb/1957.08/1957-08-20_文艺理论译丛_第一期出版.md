    First Issue of "Translations of Literary Theory" Published

    The Literary Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has compiled a series of irregular publications called "Translations of Literary Theory." The purpose is to systematically and with emphasis introduce aesthetic and literary theory works from various countries around the world, including monographs and essays by important theoretical critics and writers of various eras and schools on basic principles and even creative techniques; primarily focusing on classics, but also introducing contemporary articles and other materials of special significance when necessary.

    The first issue has now been published, containing a total of ten essays, including three from Germany, one from France, and six from old Russia.

    This issue mainly introduces essays by Marx, Engels, and early Marxists. For example, Marx's "A Critical Annotation on the Article 'On the mysteries of Paris' by Eugène Sue" is Marx's earliest, most detailed, and most significant essay using a new perspective to discuss literary works and literary thoughts (this issue publishes the first part). Engels's "The True Socialists Poetry" and "German Socialism in Verse and Prose" mainly analyze and criticize the so-called "socialist" poems of German petty-bourgeois poets at the time, revealing their ideological essence of praising the bourgeoisie and serving the consolidation of the old social system. Lafargue's "The Legend of Hugo," due to historical limitations and the demands of the situation at the time, although the comments on Hugo are not comprehensive enough, the depth of the ideological analysis and the accuracy of the facts make it one of the important literary criticisms of early Marxists. Plekhanov's "The Proletarian Movement and Bourgeois Art," through the analysis of specific works, discusses many famous artists and the various schools they represent in the international arena in the early twentieth century. The article has a strong artistic appreciation and high theoretical generalization ability. Gorky's "The Destruction of the Personality" thoroughly exposes the various reactionary ideological tendencies and artistic schools of the decadent bourgeoisie prevalent in the Russian literary world at that time. Although individual arguments are still worth further study, the basic spirit and many arguments of the entire article are very good and correct.

    This issue of "Translations of Literary Theory" also introduces remarks on literary criticism and creative experience by several outstanding realist writers of nineteenth-century Russia, including: Shedrin's "Letter to the Editorial Board of 'The European Herald'," Turgenev's "General Preface to Six Novels," Leo Tolstoy's "Preface and Postscript (Draft) to 'War and Peace'," and "Selected Translations of Tolstoy's Letters."

    “文艺理论译丛”第一期出版
    中国科学院文学研究所编译了一种不定期的丛书：“文艺理论译丛”。目的是有计划有重点地介绍世界各国的美学和文艺理论著作，包括各时代各流派重要的理论批评家和作家的有关基本原理以至创作技巧的专著和论文；以古典为主，必要时也介绍有特殊意义的当代文章和其他资料等。
    现在第一期已经出版，共登十篇论文，计德国的三篇、法国的一篇、旧俄的六篇。
    这期主要是介绍马克思、恩格斯及初期马克思主义者的论文。如马克思的“对于欧仁·苏的小说‘巴黎的秘密’的一个批判的考察”，是马克思用新的观点论文艺作品及文艺思想的最早、最详细、也最有意义的一篇论文（这期刊载了第一部分）。恩格斯的“真正社会主义的诗”及“诗和散文中的德国社会主义”二篇，主要是分析批判当时德国小资产阶级诗人的所谓“社会主义”的诗作，揭示他们歌颂资产阶级、为旧社会制度的巩固而服务的思想实质。拉法格的“雨果传说”，由于历史条件的限制和当时情势的要求，对雨果的评论虽说不够全面，但是所作思想分析的深刻，所据事实的详确，称得上是初期马克思主义者重要的文艺批评之一。普列汉诺夫的“无产阶级运动和资产阶级艺术”，通过对具体作品的分析，论述了二十世纪初年国际上许多著名艺术家及他们所代表的各种流派，文章的艺术欣赏力很强，理论概括力也高。高尔基的“个性的毁灭”，对当时俄国文艺界流行的没落资产阶级的种种反动的思想倾向和艺术流派，追根究底地给以尽情的揭露，虽然个别论点还值得进一步研究，但全文的基本精神和许多论点是很好很正确的。
    这期“文艺理论译丛”还介绍了俄国十九世纪几个杰出的现实主义作家的有关文艺批评和创作经验的言论，有：谢德林的“给‘欧罗巴公报’编辑部的信”，屠格涅夫的“六部长篇小说总序”，列夫·托尔斯泰的“‘战争与和平’序和跋”（草稿）和“托尔斯泰书信选译”。
