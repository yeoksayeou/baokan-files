Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 8th: According to the Korean Central News Agency from Kaesong: At the Secretary Meeting of the Korean Military Armistice Commission held today, the Korean-Chinese side's secretary protested the US side's armed vessels intruding into the Korean-Chinese side's area, attacking fishing boats, and abducting fishermen, which are criminal violations of the Armistice Agreement.

On August 5th, at 23:25, US armed vessels intruded into the vicinity of Daesuyak Island within the Korean-Chinese side's area, attacking a North Korean fishing boat engaged in fishing and abducting seven fishermen. At the meeting, the Korean-Chinese side's secretary lodged a serious protest with the US side regarding this matter and demanded that the US side immediately return the abducted personnel and fishing boat.

At the meeting, the Korean-Chinese side's secretary pointed out that since the armistice, US armed vessels and personnel have repeatedly intruded into the coasts and islands within the Korean-Chinese side's area, attacking, plundering, and murdering peaceful residents. The Korean-Chinese side has repeatedly protested the US side's piratical acts at the Military Armistice Commission and secretary meetings, and has submitted lists of abducted personnel, demanding that the US side return these personnel. However, the US side has not yet returned a single person and is continuing to carry out these hostile armed attacks and piratical acts.

The Korean-Chinese side's secretary pointed out that the US side must immediately cease these hostile acts, severely punish the personnel involved in accordance with the Armistice Agreement, and return all the fishermen abducted in the past.

    在朝鲜军事停战委员会秘书长会议上
    朝中方面抗议美方海盗行为
    新华社平壤8日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯：朝中方面秘书长在今天举行的朝鲜军事停战委员会秘书长会议上，抗议美方武装船只侵入朝中方面地区袭击渔船和劫去渔民的违反停战协定的罪恶事件。
    8月5日二十三时二十五分，美方武装船只侵入朝中方面地区内的大睡鸭岛附近，袭击正在捕鱼的朝鲜北部的一只渔船，劫去渔民七人。朝中方面的秘书长在会议上就这件事向美方提出严重抗议，并且要求美方立即送还被劫去的人员和渔船。
    朝中方面秘书长在会上指出，停战以来，美方武装船只和武装人员多次侵入朝中方面地区内的海岸和岛屿，袭击、劫掠和杀害和平居民。朝中方面对于美方这种海盗行为已经在军事停战委员会和秘书长会议上多次提出抗议，并且提出被劫人员名单，要求美方送还这些人员。但是，美方到现在还没有送还一个人，并且还在继续进行这种敌对的武装袭击和海盗行为。
    朝中方面秘书长指出，美方必须立即停止这种敌对行为，根据停战协定严惩有关人员，并且送还历次被劫去的全部渔民。
