Moscow, August 5th (By our reporter) – The Youth Festival in Moscow is filled with joyous song and dance day and night. On the evening of August 4th, another grand song and dance festival was held. On the stage of the Green Theater in the Central Gorky Culture and Rest Park, approximately twenty countries' young artists performed their most brilliant songs and dances. That evening, in dozens of theaters, parks, and open-air stages in Moscow, young artists from various countries continued to perform dramas, music, dances, and acrobatics; another grand ball was held in the Kremlin; and a performance of Soviet ballet with hundreds of performers was also staged at the Dynamo Stadium.

　　The Green Theater in Gorky Park, which can accommodate five to six thousand people, was packed. Tens of thousands more Moscow residents could not get in and had to enjoy the night view from high ground outside the venue.

　　At nine o'clock, the song and dance festival began with a burst of resounding cannon fire. The spirited performance of the military band from the Soviet Labor Reserve School and the large chorus of hundreds of people won warm applause from the audience. The Peking Opera actors of the Chinese Youth Art Troupe performed a segment of the water battle from "Yandang Mountain," and applause from the audience was incessant from beginning to end. The light dance of Spanish girls, the clear solo of an Argentine singer, the pleasant dance of Polish actors, and the graceful ballet of Soviet actors were all praised by the audience. The longest program was the Romanian dance. Girls draped in veils and boys riding white horses danced with black sheep and big bears for almost half an hour to the melody of the music. The shortest program was the Finnish singers' unison singing of "When I Stroll in the Evening," which lasted only half a minute.

    满园欢笑关不住  轻歌曼舞抒友情
    本报莫斯科5日电　联欢节中的莫斯科日日夜夜欢乐歌舞。8月4日晚上又举行了一次规模盛大的歌舞节。在中央高尔基文化休息公园绿色剧场的舞台上，大约有二十个国家的青年艺术家们表演了他们最精采的歌舞。这天晚上，在莫斯科的几十处剧院里、公园和广场的露天舞台上，各国青年艺术家们继续演出了戏剧、音乐、舞蹈和杂技；克里姆林宫里又举行了一次盛大的舞会；狄纳莫运动场上也又演出了一场有几百人表演的苏联巴蕾舞。
    高尔基公园能容纳五、六千人的绿色剧场里，观众挤得席无虚座。还有上万的莫斯科市民们不能进场，只好在场外高处欣赏夜景。
    九点钟，歌舞节的演出在一阵嘹亮的炮声中开始。苏联劳动后备学校的军乐队声势浩大的演奏和几百人的大合唱博得观众的热烈掌声。中国青年艺术团京剧演员们表演了“雁荡山”中水战的一段戏，自始至终台下掌声不绝。西班牙少女轻快的舞蹈、阿根廷歌手清朗的独唱、波兰演员情调愉快的舞蹈、苏联演员姿态优美的巴蕾舞都为观众所赞赏。演出中，最长的节目是罗马尼亚的舞蹈。披着轻纱的少女和骑着白马的少年同黑羊、大熊一起跳舞，随着音乐的旋律一直跳了大半个钟点。节目最短的是芬兰歌手们的齐唱“当我傍晚散步的时候”，只有半分钟。
