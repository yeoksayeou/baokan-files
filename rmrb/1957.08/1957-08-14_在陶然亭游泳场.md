At Taoranting Swimming Pool
Shi Yuzhong

	On a wide, soft sandy area, groups of people in various swimsuits are freely bathing in the embrace of the sun, lying down, chasing each other. After a while, they
  "plop" into the clear blue pool, the water splashing against the embankment, harmoniously echoing bursts of laughter.

	In two oval-shaped small pools, four bright and smooth terrazzo sculptures of "mushrooms" constantly pour out clear springs, a group of innocent and lively children, listening to the "rustling" water, comically learning various swimming postures, splashing water and playing...

	What is this place? This is Beijing's Taoranting Swimming Pool, the largest and best-equipped in China.

	This swimming pool is located in the southwest corner of Beijing, directly opposite the famous Taoranting Park, with its lush greenery. Since the beginning of summer, thousands of workers, cadres, students, and others have come here every day to enjoy their leisure time.

	Many years ago, this was a desolate area covered with reeds and filled with messy graves. With the growth of Taoranting Park, this previously uninhabited place began to become lively. In 1955, the government invested two million yuan to build this swimming pool.

	The swimming pool covers a total area of ​​more than 50,000 square meters. Inside there are two children's pools and an adult practice pool, a competition pool, and a diving pool. All six pools are paved with small ceramic tiles, which are clean and bright, and the pools can accommodate more than 4,000 people swimming at the same time.

	The competition pool is located in the center of the swimming pool and is usually used for practice. On the ten lanes, swimming enthusiasts are orderly and bravely advancing through the waves. This pool is 25 meters wide, 50 meters long, and 2 meters deep, with a flat bottom. In the three underground observation rooms on the east side of the pool, we can clearly see the swimmers' healthy postures through the glass windows.

	Adjacent to the south end of the competition pool is the diving pool, 25 meters square and 5 meters deep. A "swallow" flew down from the 10-meter-high diving platform, "Look, what a beautiful posture!" The child next to me had not finished speaking, and the "swallow" had already plunged into the water, with several white water columns rising from the surface. Around the diving pool, there are ten diving platforms of different heights, one meter, three meters, five meters, seven and a half meters, and ten meters, where people can practice according to their preferences.

	Surrounding the competition pool and diving pool, there is a horseshoe-shaped grandstand that can accommodate 6,000 spectators. Standing on the highest level of the grandstand, you can vaguely see the distant Western Hills with a touch of green pines.

	The water in each pool is always so clear. Cleaning work is carried out here at any time using a circulation method, which can be completely circulated every six to eight hours on average. During circulation, disinfection is also carried out. At the same time, the water in each pool can be independently discharged and drained, which is very convenient.

	To the north of the competition pool are two overflow swimming pools. This wide swimming area strongly attracts those who are learning to swim. Some people put their hands on their friends' arms, let their bodies float in the water, and continuously stretch their legs to both sides and then contract them in the middle, practicing the leg movements of the breaststroke. Those who have initially mastered the technique are patiently doing such exercises, they are like a little frog with not very skilled but bold, appearing intermittently in the white waves.

	We came to the cloakroom and shower room, and the terrazzo floor was clean and dazzling. There are more than 4,000 lockers in the cloakroom, and people can deposit and retrieve their clothes with keys. In the shower room, there are rows of sprinkler faucets.

	On the beach in the northeast of the swimming pool, which is as wide as 10,000 square meters, there are many sports equipment, and some people are swinging, playing on parallel bars... To enter the swimming pool from the beach, you must pass through a shower corridor. Countless tiny water springs are sprayed from sixty-four faucets to wash the sand off the body.

	After taking a tour, we returned to the children's swimming pool, where the group of innocent, lively, and mischievous children were still splashing water and playing. (Attached picture)

    在陶然亭游泳场
    施毓忠
    在一片宽阔软绵的沙地上，一群群穿着各色游泳衣的人们，自由自在地沐浴在阳光的怀抱里，他们躺卧着、相互追逐着。一会儿，他们又
  “扑通”一声跳入碧蓝的池水中，池水泛起朵朵浪花迫击着堤岸，和谐地迎合着阵阵的欢笑。
    两个椭圆的小池里，四支又亮又滑的水磨石雕塑成的“蘑菇”不断地倾泻着清泉，一群天真活泼的儿童，倾听着“沙沙”的流水，滑稽地学习着各种游泳姿势，泼水嬉闹……。
    这是什么地方？这是我国规模最大、设备完善的北京陶然亭游泳场。
    这个游泳场座落在北京市西南角，它的斜对面，就是著名的绿海成荫的陶然亭公园。入夏以来，每天都有成千上万的工人、干部、学生等来到这里欢度暇余时光。
    好多年以前，这里是芦苇遍野、乱坟成堆的荒凉地带。随着陶然亭公园的成长，这片人迹罕到的地方开始热闹起来了。1955年政府用了二百万元的投资兴工建筑了这个游泳场。
    游泳场总面积占地五万多平方公尺。内有两个儿童池和成人练习池，一个比赛池，一个跳水池。六个池子全用小瓷砖铺成，光洁明亮，池内能够同时容纳四千多人游泳。
    比赛池座落在游泳场的中央，平时供人练习。在十条游道上，游泳爱好者们正在有秩序地、奋勇地破浪前进。这个宽二十五公尺，长五十公尺，深两公尺的池子，池底平坦。在池子东面的三个地下观测室里，我们隔着玻璃窗清彻地看见游泳者们健美的姿势。
    紧靠比赛池的南端是二十五公尺见方、五公尺深的跳水池。一只“飞燕”从十公尺高的跳台上飞了下来，“看啊，多美的姿势！”我旁边的小朋友话还没有说完，那只
  “飞燕”早就插入水里去了，水面上冲起几株白色的小水柱。跳水池的周围设有一公尺、三公尺、五公尺、七点五公尺和十公尺不同高度的十个跳水台，人们可以根据自己的爱好进行练习。
    围绕着比赛池和跳水池，有一个能容纳六千观众的马蹄形看台。站在看台的最高一层可以隐约地望见苍松一抹的西山。
    每个池子的水永远是那么清彻。这里随时都用循环法进行着清洁工作，平均每六至八小时就可全部循环一次，在循环时，还要进行消毒。同时，每个池子的水都能单独放进排出，十分方便。
    比赛池的北面是两个泄水游泳池，这片宽阔的游泳场地强烈地吸引着那些初学游泳的人们。一些人双手搭着朋友的膊臂，让身子浮在水中，两腿不断地向两侧伸开又向中间夹缩，在练习着蛙泳的腿部动作。那些初步掌握了技术的人，耐心地作着这样的练习，他们像一只技术不大高明但却大胆的小青蛙，一隐一现地出现在白浪中间。
    我们来到存衣室和淋浴室，水磨石的地面光洁映目。存衣室有四千多个柜子，人们可以凭钥匙将衣自存自取。淋浴室里是一排排的喷水龙头。
    在游泳场东北面的那个宽达一万平方公尺的沙滩上，安排着许多运动器械，有人正在荡秋千、玩双杠……。从沙滩上进入游泳池必须经过一道淋浴廊。无数条细小的水泉从六十四个龙头上喷射出来把身上的沙子冲洗干净。
    转了一圈，我们又回到了儿童游泳池，那群天真活泼而又挑皮的孩子，还在不断地泼水嬉闹。（附图片）
