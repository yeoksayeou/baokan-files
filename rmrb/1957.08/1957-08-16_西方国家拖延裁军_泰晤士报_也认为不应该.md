Xinhua News Agency, London, August 15th. "The Times" today criticized the delaying tactics employed by the West in the disarmament talks.

The "Times" editorial said that the negotiations have been dragging on week after week, while Western countries are still putting forward their proposals piecemeal. They have put forward many plans, and are still adding to them. "But the method of passing the buck back and forth results in the inability to start comprehensive and broad consultations."

    西方国家拖延裁军
    “泰晤士报”也认为不应该
    据新华社伦敦15日电  “泰晤士报”今天批评了西方在裁军谈判中采用的拖延策略。
    “泰晤士报”社论说，谈判已经一星期又一星期地拖了下来，而西方国家却仍在零零碎碎地提出它们的建议。它们已经提出了许多计划，现在还在不断地增加。“但是把球儿盘来盘去的办法结果是使得全面的广泛商谈无法开始”。
