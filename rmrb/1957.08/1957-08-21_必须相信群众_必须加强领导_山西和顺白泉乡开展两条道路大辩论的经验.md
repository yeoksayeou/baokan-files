We Must Believe in the Masses and Strengthen Leadership
The Experience of Baiquan Township, Heshun, Shanxi in Carrying Out a Great Debate on Two Roads

How to carry out a great debate on the two roads of socialism and capitalism in rural areas, solve farmers' ideological problems, and raise farmers' political awareness? Baiquan Township in Heshun County, Shanxi Province, provides a successful experience. The experience of Baiquan Township shows that the central issue in carrying out the great debate is the issue of following the mass line in leadership; we must believe in the masses, boldly mobilize the masses, and carry out free debate. On the basis of "thorough venting and thorough arguing," we should summarize and conduct positive education. At the same time, according to the spirit of rectification alongside correction, we must promptly and decisively handle practical problems and enlighten and educate the masses through action.

The great debate in Baiquan Township was conducted under the direct guidance of the Heshun County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, which sent a work team. The debate lasted for one month (mid-May to mid-June). Judging from the actual effect of the movement, it was successful.

	Understanding Thinking, Cultivating Key Personnel

The Jinhua Agricultural Cooperative in Baiquan Township is a typical cooperative in Heshun County. The entire cooperative has 227 households. Last year, it suffered a major disaster, but it was still able to be self-sufficient in grain. The average distribution per person was more than 370 jin, with the highest being more than 500 jin. Seventy-one households had a relatively good life, accounting for 31% of the total number of households; 125 households had enough grain to eat but lacked pocket money, accounting for more than 53%; 34 households had little labor, a large population, or had difficulties in life due to illness or disability, accounting for 15%. In terms of the political and ideological situation of the cooperative members, 128 households actively took the socialist road and sincerely supported the agricultural cooperative, accounting for 56.3% of the total number of households; 85 households basically supported the cooperative system but had dissenting opinions, accounting for more than 37.4%; 14 households were dissatisfied with the cooperative and had serious negative and resistant emotions, accounting for 6.2%. Most of those who loved the cooperative as their home and worked actively were poor or lower-middle peasants. Most of those who were dissatisfied with the cooperative and worked passively were landlords, rich peasants, and some well-to-do peasants. However, among cooperative members of all classes of peasants, some had varying degrees of dissatisfaction with the state, the socialist system, the cooperative, and leading cadres.

After understanding the above situation, the work team, according to the spirit of Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference on February 27, mobilized the peasant masses to speak out freely. First, it explained the Party's policy, dispelling cadres' fear of being criticized, and farmers' concerns about getting into trouble, being labeled, and not having their problems solved. It encouraged them to express their opinions without any worries and expose their true thoughts. In order to ensure the smooth development of the movement, the work team began to pay attention to cultivating key personnel. First, it unified the thinking and enhanced the understanding of Party members, League members, and non-Party activists, encouraging them to take the lead in speaking out and making a preliminary analysis of the contradictions. Then, the key personnel went deep into the fields and homes to conduct liaison visits, individual heart-to-heart talks, and mobilize people according to their different ages and genders. After the speaking out began, small-scale forums were first held for young people, women, honorary servicemen, and demobilized soldiers to allow them to express their opinions and make preliminary discussions. In this way, the entire cooperative put forward 105 opinions within a few days, involving the relationship between the individual and the country, the relationship between workers and peasants, the individual and the collective, leaders and the masses, and the relationship between farmers. The scope of the content was very broad, and the differences in everyone's views and understanding further increased the complexity of the problems. Therefore, how to guide the peasants to carry out free debate, clarify right and wrong, and enhance understanding was a matter that required careful consideration.

	Promoting Democracy, Thorough Venting and Arguing

The problems were raised, and the masses' emotions were focused on demanding a solution. They said, "The anger has been vented thoroughly, let's see how it will be solved!" At that time, negative opinions prevailed, and the upright Party member cadres had negative and pessimistic emotions, even having the thought of "We'll step down, let you try!" At this time, the work team convened a meeting of the Party branch committee to study the opinions put forward by the masses one by one and distinguish their nature. After research, everyone understood that among the 105 opinions: one category belonged to the masses' vague understanding or misunderstanding, accounting for 66.6%; one category belonged to the leadership's work style or real existing specific problems that needed to be solved urgently, accounting for more than 33%. The meeting decided that the solution was to solve ideological problems ideologically, to make active self-criticism on leadership issues, and to solve problems that could be solved immediately. Then, a meeting of Party members, League members, and activists was held to introduce the basis of the speaking out and to discuss solutions together, so that they could unify their understanding and master the weapons of debate. Finally, it was summarized into three representative ideological problems: First, are farmers' lives hard? What is it harder than? Where is the hardship? What should be done to not be hard? Second, is agricultural cooperation good? Who did the cooperative restrain? Is it good to restrain them? Is it okay not to restrain them? Third, is leadership necessary? Is it okay to have no leadership? Why do leaders always talk about the masses? Why do the masses always complain about the leaders? Do the leaders have difficulties? Will they make mistakes? Is the blame for the shortcomings of the cooperative solely on the leaders? These three questions were distributed to the production teams for the masses to debate.

When the debate began, everyone had already affirmed that farmers' lives were harder than in the Soviet Union and would be harder in the future. But is it really hard now? Many people said, "It's hard to say." Some people disagreed that it was hard now, but they couldn't give a reason. It was some elderly farmers who had experienced many hardships who answered this question. They used their own experiences to tell the young people, "In my opinion, life is much better now. In the past, we ate chaff and vegetables on weekdays, and we didn't even eat pure grain during the New Year and holidays, let alone pocket money. Now, we have three meals of grain and noodles a day, noodles every other day, and we pay attention to dressing. How many people wear rubber shoes on rainy days!" The old farmers scolded those who said life was hard for not knowing how good they had it. But the young people were still not convinced, and they asked: Is it not hard to have no pocket money and not enjoy eating? As soon as this statement came out, someone immediately cited facts to refute it. The facts showed that the current young people are the most favored in the countryside. Where does the hardship come from? Some people said that they had been shouting for a long time, but they had never thought that last year was a major disaster, and the hardship could only be blamed on God. Some people said that they blamed the leading cadres for their subjectivism. Last year, they insisted on planting "Golden Queen." If they had followed us and planted more buckwheat, they could have eaten two more meals of roasted cakes. Many people disagreed with this way of simply blaming the leaders. They said that the leaders had already made several self-criticisms for their subjectivism, and besides, it was for our own good. It was a natural disaster that "Golden Queen" did not yield a harvest, and the leaders did not have bad intentions. Some people also believed that the hardship was caused by the "exploitation" of workers and cadres, saying that everything they eat, wear, and earn is higher than that of farmers! And they advocated lowering the wages of workers and cadres, raising the prices of agricultural products, and lowering the prices of industrial products. It took a lot of effort to discuss these issues. Finally, most people agreed that the wages of workers are high because their production technology is high and the value of their labor is high, and it is only reasonable to pay wages according to work. Some people also introduced the living conditions of workers, saying that although workers' wages are high, their expenses are also high. Rent, water, and electricity all cost money, and their lives are not actually very rich. Those with families are even more difficult. When the price difference between industrial and agricultural products was mentioned, many people had personal experience. They affirmed that the prices of industrial products are not high now. During the Japanese rule, one dou of corn could be exchanged for a small piece of cloth, but now it can buy more than three pieces. During the Kuomintang rule, one dou of rice could buy seven chi of foreign cloth and four jin of kerosene, but now it can buy nine chi of foreign cloth and more than six jin of oil. Everyone also disagreed with raising the prices of agricultural products. They said that grain is the country's main material and cannot be raised or lowered arbitrarily. A rise or fall would cause price fluctuations, and in the end, the farmers would still suffer. After laying out the facts and calculating, many people who originally had opinions about the country and thought that farmers were suffering and being bullied gradually calmed down and were convinced. At the same time, everyone also made it clear that in order to get rid of poverty and move towards happiness, relying on state relief or turning farmers into workers (some people suggested giving the state work and receiving monthly wages in the discussion) were all wrong ideas; we can only think about increasing production and strive for a bumper harvest of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. At this point, those who previously thought that life was hard and took a negative and complaining attitude also became active.

When discussing the issue of cooperation, some people said: Advanced cooperatives are good in everything, but they are not free, tying people up tightly. Even pocket money is hard to get, and it's not as good as working short-term jobs or being a hireling (long-term worker) in the old society! This immediately caused a fierce quarrel. Many people cited the facts of the new and old societies to refute this. They said that hirelings in the old society were worse than pigs and dogs, and tenant farmers were ruined and had no way to beg for food or borrow money. It is against conscience to say that joining a cooperative is not as good as being a hireling. But many people still agreed that cooperatives are not free and control too much. Later, further exploration was made: What exactly is not free in the cooperative, and what is controlled too much? Everyone then realized that it is not free to take crooked paths and do bad things, and it is controlled to disregard everyone's life and death and only care about personal wealth. And it was determined that if these people are not controlled, they will again embark on the old road of a few people getting rich and then exploiting others, and most people being unlucky and then being exploited. The discussion of this issue made the farmers take a big step forward in their understanding of class viewpoints and the two roads. In addition, some people with vague class positions said that they did not feel warm after joining the cooperative, and that the cooperative's leading cadres only cared about assigning work and did not care about the pain and illness of the cooperative members, and it was not as good as when they were hirelings and someone would cook soup and deliver it to them when they were sick. At this time, everyone's views were very clear, and they immediately questioned, "Who has ever delivered food to you?" The answer was, "The furrow leader." "That's still our own class, not the landlord pitying you!" Everyone advised such people to carefully consider the benefits of the cooperative and to look at the problem comprehensively. The cooperative is like a thermos, cold on the outside and hot on the inside. Didn't a cooperative member get sick for several months last year and get relief and assistance from the cooperative to get through the difficult situation? Such a person would have been ruined in the old society. During the discussion, some people also believed that the death of livestock in the cooperative was due to joining the cooperative. Everyone criticized this, saying that this was a problem with the leadership and a shortcoming in the work, and could not be blamed on the cooperative, because "things depend on people, and the cooperative depends on people's management. White flour is delicious, but some people still bake it into burnt pancakes and make it into糊涂 noodles, which are impossible to eat!" At this point, everyone laughed heartily, feeling that the reasoning was clear and they felt happy.

When discussing the issue of leadership, some people were initially very angry and emotional, and even thought that "leadership is not democratic, it is also possible to abolish leadership. No one cared in the old society, and we still lived!" But most people had a clear understanding and disagreed with this statement. They believed that a family must have someone in charge, and without leadership, the cooperative members would inevitably argue and quarrel every day, and nothing could be done. Some people pointed out that there was also leadership in the old society, but it was the landlords, rich peasants, and their lackeys and yamen runners. They did not care about the lives of the peasants, but only cared about oppressing and exploiting the poor and urging the payment of rent and taxes. After the issue of whether or not leadership was needed was resolved, some people asked why everyone only felt that the leadership was not satisfactory since the current leaders were serving everyone. After discussion, everyone realized that this was because the leaders were planning more for long-term interests and overall interests, while everyone was considering more from the perspective of immediate interests and personal interests. And it was affirmed that with more than 200 households in the cooperative, one opinion and one requirement per household, even a living immortal could not satisfy every household and make everything go smoothly.

When the discussion of the ideological understanding of leadership was completed, and the topic just turned to the shortcomings of the work style of leading cadres, the work team and cooperative cadres promptly and actively made self-criticism and promised to solve specific problems such as cadres occupying too much private plot. At this time, those who originally had grievances against the cadres also turned from anger to joy and consciously examined their own shortcomings. Some said they had stolen corn ears from the cooperative, and some said they only cared about earning work points and did not care about public property... Finally, the cadres and cooperative members unanimously agreed that the past practice of running the cooperative democratically was not good enough, and in the future, the cadres should promote democracy and follow the mass line, and the cooperative members should obey the leadership and love the cooperative as their home. This greatly enhanced mutual understanding and unity between cadres and the masses.

	Summarizing and Raising One Step

After discussing specific topics such as farmers' lives, cooperation, and the relationship between leaders and the masses, the ideological understanding of the farmers in the entire cooperative has been greatly improved. However, how to raise the understanding of specific issues to a correct understanding and treatment of all issues within the people still requires a summary of education. Therefore, farmers were immediately asked to recall some issues related to ideological methods and viewpoints to help them maintain a correct attitude towards the country, socialism, and the cooperative. Through a summary of systematic education, everyone further recognized that the past wrong ideas were mostly the result of understanding things too little and inferring from their own conditions or looking at things from a selfish psychology. Everyone also understood that problems must be studied calmly. Words that are not spoken are not understood, and knots in the heart are not untied. When words are understood and knots are untied, people are happy and labor becomes energetic. This is the fact, after 93% of the 510 people who should be educated in Baiquan Township received this profound ideological education, they really showed ease and happiness, and their labor enthusiasm immediately rose. For example, women who originally did not go to the fields in the fourth production team also went to the fields to produce, and the cooperative members also used their rest time and holidays to go up the mountains to collect wild grass.

In order to consolidate the achievements of this movement and to turn political and ideological work into a regular activity, Baiquan Township rectified the Party and League organizations in the later stage of the movement. With the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, it examined the Party's leadership work. It focused on examining and criticizing the problems of relaxing political and ideological leadership and the shortcomings of Party members and cadres not being deep enough in their work and not being democratic enough in their style. And it decided on specific methods to strengthen political and ideological leadership and democratic cooperative management in the future. The Party branch stipulated that it would study the ideological situation of the cooperative members once a month, improve the political education system of the people's schools, hold three political classes a month, and widely use propaganda tools such as blackboards, loudspeakers, and reading groups to carry out regular political and ideological education activities.

    必须相信群众　必须加强领导
    山西和顺白泉乡开展两条道路大辩论的经验
    如何在农村开展社会主义和资本主义两条道路的大辩论，解决农民思想问题，提高农民政治觉悟？山西省和顺县白泉乡提供了成功的经验。白泉乡的经验说明：开展大辩论的中心问题是领导上走群众路线的问题；必须相信群众，放手发动群众，开展自由争论，在“放透、吵通”的基础上，总结起来进行正面的教育。同时，要根据边整边改的精神，迅速果断地处理实际问题，从行动上启发群众教育群众。
    白泉乡开展大辩论，是中共和顺县委直接派工作组指导进行的。这次辩论共进行了一个月时间（5月中旬到6月中旬）。从运动的实际效果来考察，是成功的。
            摸清思想，培养骨干
    白泉乡晋华农业社是和顺县的一般社。全社二百二十七户，去年遭了大灾，但粮食还能自给自足，每人平均分了三百七十多斤，最多的五百多斤。社员生活较好的七十一户，占总户数的31％；有粮吃缺零花钱的一百二十五户，占53％多；劳力少、人口多或因病残生活困难的三十四户，占15％。社员的政治思想情况，积极走社会主义道路，真诚拥护农业社的一百二十八户，占全社总户数的56.3％；基本上拥护合作社制度，但有分歧意见的八十五户，占37.4％多；对社不满并有严重消极抵触情绪的十四户，占6.2％。爱社如家、劳动积极的绝大部分是贫农或下中农，对社不满和消极怠工的多数是地主富农和某些富裕农民。但是，在农民各阶层社员中，都有一些社员对国家、对社会主义制度、对合作社、对领导干部有不同程度的不满情绪。
    工作组了解上述情况以后，根据毛主席2月27日在最高国务会议上的讲话精神，动员农民群众大鸣大放。首先交代党的方针，解除干部怕挨整，农民怕惹人、怕扣帽子、怕不解决问题等顾虑，启发他们毫无顾虑地提出意见，暴露真实思想。为了使运动顺利开展，工作组开始就注意培养骨干。首先在党员、团员和非党积极分子中，统一思想，提高认识，带头鸣放，并且初步分析矛盾。然后，由骨干分子深入田间、家庭，串连访问，个别谈心，根据男女老少不同对象分别动员。鸣放开始后，先开青年、妇女、荣誉军人和转业军人等小型座谈会，让他们提出意见，作初步讨论。这样做，全社几天之内就提出一百零五条意见，涉及个人和国家关系、工农关系、个人和集体、领导和群众、以及农民之间关系等问题。内容范围很广，加上各人的说法和认识程度上的差异，更增加了问题的复杂性。因此，如何引导农民开展自由争论，达到辨明是非，提高认识，是颇费思索的问题。
            发扬民主，放透吵通
    问题提出来了，群众的情绪集中在要求解决问题上。他们说：“气是放透了，就看怎么解决吧！”当时，反面意见占了上风，正派的党员干部有消极悲观情绪，甚至有“咱下台，给你们干干看”的念头。这时，工作组召开党支部委员会议，把群众所提的意见，逐条研究，分清是非性质。经过研究，大家明白在一百零五条意见中：一类属于群众认识模糊或误解，占66.6％；一类属于领导作风或确实存在的具体问题，急待解决，占33％多。会议决定解决的办法是，思想问题从思想上解决，领导问题主动作检讨，能解决的立即解决。接着，又召开了党员、团员和积极分子会议，介绍鸣放的底子，共同商量解决办法，使他们认识统一，掌握辩论武器。最后，归纳为三个有代表性的思想问题：第一、农民生活苦不苦，比什么苦？苦在什么地方？要想不苦怎么办？第二、农业合作化好不好？合作社制住了那些人？制住好不好？不制住行不行？第三、要不要领导？没领导行不行？为什么领导总是说群众？群众总是埋怨领导？领导有没有困难？会不会犯错误？合作社的缺点是否光怨领导的过？这三个问题，以生产队为单位，放下去让群众争论。
    争论开始，对于农民生活比苏联苦、比将来苦，这是大家早就肯定了的。但现在到底苦不苦呢？许多人表示“难说”。有的人不同意现在苦，但嘴上讲不出个道理来。解答这个问题的是一些久经风霜的老年农民。他们以亲身经历对青年人说：“以我看，现在生活好过的多了。过去平日吃糠咽菜，过年过节也不吃净粮食，更不用讲零花钱了。现在呢，一天三顿粮食面，两天一顿餎餎，还讲究穿戴，下雨天有多少人脚上穿胶皮鞋！”老农责备说生活苦的人是身在福中不知福。但青年们还不服气，又提出：没有零花钱，吃的也不香甜，这不苦吗？这种说法一出口，当即有人举出事实驳倒，事实说明现在的青年是农村享受最高的人。苦是从哪里来的？有人说，叫喊了半天，就没想想去年遭了大灾，苦只能埋怨老天爷。有人说怨领导干部主观主义，去年硬是他们叫多种“金皇后”，要依着咱多种些荞麦，也能多吃两顿烤酪酪。许多人不同意这样单埋怨领导的说法。他们说，领导主观早作了几回检查，再说那也是为了咱们好，“金皇后”不收是遇了天灾，也不是领导出坏心。还有一些人认为苦是工人、干部“剥削”成的，说看他吃的穿的挣的，那一样不比农民高！并且主张降低工人和干部工资，提高农产品价格，降低工业品价格。讨论这些问题时，确实费了很多口舌。最后，多数人都认为：工人工资高是因为生产技术高，劳动价值大，工资按劳取酬再合理不过。有人还介绍了工人生活情况，说工人工资高，开支也大，房租水电，拉烧土倒灰渣都得花钱，实际上生活并不太富裕，有家眷的还有困难。提到工农业产品的差价，许多人有亲身体验，他们肯定说：现在工业品价格并不高，日本人统治时期，一斗玉米换一匹小布，现在能买三匹多。国民党统治时期，一斗米买七尺洋布，四斤煤油，现在能买九尺洋布，六斤多油。大家也不同意提高农产品价格。他们说，粮食是国家的主要物资，不能冒涨冒降，一涨一降，引起物价波动，到头来还是农民吃亏。经过这样摆事实，打算盘，使许多原来对国家有意见的，认为农民吃亏受气的人，也逐渐消了火气，心服口软了。同时，大家还明确了要想摆脱生活贫苦，走向幸福，靠国家救济，或把农民变成工人（有人在讨论中提出给国家干活，按月领工资）等都是错误的想法；只有从增产上着想，争取农林牧副业大丰收。至此，过去认为眼前生活苦并且采取消极埋怨态度的，也变得积极起来了。
    在讨论合作化问题的时候，有人提出：高级社什么都好，就是有些不自由，把人捆的死把把的，连个零花钱也闹不了，还不如旧社会打短工、当觅汉（长工）活畅哩！这一下就引起了激烈争吵。许多人列举新旧社会的事实来反驳。说旧社会当长工的猪狗不如，当佃户的家破人亡，讨吃无门，告贷无路。说入了合作社不如当长工，这是昧着良心说胡话。但还有许多人同意合作社不自由，控制太死的说法。后来，作了进一步探讨：合作社到底有什么不自由，控制什么太死？大家才搞清楚：走歪路干坏事的不自由，不顾大家死活只管个人发财致富的受控制。而且认定不控制这些人，就会又走上少数人发财再去剥削人，多数人倒运，再去受剥削的旧道路上去。这个问题的讨论使农民在阶级观点和两条道路的认识上前进一大步。此外，还有一些阶级立场模糊的人，说入了社感到不温暖，认为合作社领导干部只管分工派活，不管社员痛痒疾病，还不如当长工时病了有人煎汤送饭。这时大家观点很亮了，当下就责问：“谁给你送过饭？”回答是：“领墒的”。“那还是咱本阶级的人，并不是地主心疼你呀！”大家劝这样想的人好好考虑合作社的好处，看问题要全面。合作社是暖水壶，外边冷里边热。不见去年有一户社员病了几个月，得到社里救济援助，才度过难关？这种人在旧社会照例要倾家荡产的。讨论中，有人还认为合作社死了牲口是怨入社的过，大家批判说这是领导上的毛病，工作当中的缺点，不能怨合作社，因为“事在人为，社在人办。白面好吃，有人还烙成糊焦饼，赶成糊涂面条，没法 下口哩！”这一说，大家哄堂大笑一场，都感到道理讲的明白，心里痛快。
    在讨论领导问题的时候，开始有些人气愤很大，情绪激动，甚至认为“有领导就不民主，取消领导也能行，旧社会没人管，还不一样活着”！但多数人认识很明确，不同意这种说法。认为一个家还要有主事人，社员没有领导就必然七嘴八舌，天天吵架，什么事也办不了。有人指出：旧社会也有领导，就是地主富农和他的狗腿子衙役。他们不管农民生活，单管压迫剥削穷人，催租讨税。要不要领导的问题解决以后，又有人提出既然现在的领导是为大家服务，为什么大家光觉着领导不顺心。经过讨论，大家认识了这是因为领导为长远利益、整体利益打算的多，而大家从眼前利益个人利益考虑多的缘故。并且肯定说，全社二百多户，一户一个意见，一个要求，活神仙也不能作到户户满意，事事顺心。
    当讨论完对领导的思想认识问题，话题刚转到领导干部作风的缺点上，工作组和社干部就及时的主动的作了检讨，答应解决干部多占自留地等具体问题。这时候，原来对干部有怨恨的人，也转怒为喜，自觉的检查了自己缺点。有的说偷了社里玉米穗，有的说只顾个人挣工分，不爱护公共财物……最后，干部和社员一致认为过去民主办社方针执行得不够好，今后干部要发扬民主，走群众路线，社员要服从领导，爱社如家。这样就大大增强了干群之间的互相谅解和团结。
            总结起来，提高一步
    经过对农民生活、合作化和领导与群众之间的关系等具体题目的讨论，全社农民思想认识已有很大提高。但是，如何从对具体问题的认识，提高到正确认识和看待人民内部矛盾中一切问题，还需要进行总结起来的教育。因此，紧接着就让农民回味了一些属于思想方法和观点方面的问题，帮助他们对国家、对社会主义、对合作社能够保持正确的态度。经过总结起来的系统的教育，大家进一步认识了过去的错误思想，很多是由于了解事情太少，而又只从自己的条件去揣度或者从自私心理出发去看待事物的结果。大家还明白了有问题一定要心平气和地研究。话不说不通，心里疙瘩不解不开。话说通了，疙瘩解了，人就痛快了，劳动也就带劲了。事实就是这样，白泉乡五百一十个应受教育的人中，有93％受到这一次深刻的思想教育以后，果然表现轻松愉快，劳动热情立刻高涨起来。如第四生产队原来不上地的妇女也上地生产了，社员们还利用休息时间和假日上山打野草。
    为了巩固这次运动的成果，并且使政治思想工作转向经常化，白泉乡在运动后期，对党、团组织作了整顿。用批评和自我批评的精神，检查了党的领导工作。着重检查批判了放松政治思想领导问题和党员干部工作不够深入，作风不够民主等缺点。并决定了今后加强政治思想领导和民主办社的具体办法。党支部规定每月研究一次社员思想情况，健全民校政治教育制度，每月上三次政治课，并且把黑板报、广播筒、读报组等宣传工具广泛运用起来，开展经常性的政治思想教育活动。
