　　Actively Utilize Various Resources Such as Coal, Iron, and Gold
　　Heilongjiang Province Develops Small-Scale Mineral Deposits
    (Our Harbin Dispatch) Reporter Kang Weizhong reports: This year, Heilongjiang Province has spent a large amount of investment to develop small-scale mineral deposits. Although the province currently has well-known large-scale coal mines such as Hegang, Shuangyashan, and Jixi, the demand for coal is still not being met due to the development of construction projects. To solve this problem, the Provincial Department of Industry has successively built and expanded eight small coal mines in Boli, Muling, Baoqing, Linkou, Huachuan, Wuchang, and Heihe areas. The total investment in mining small-pit coal this year is 700,000 yuan, and the annual coal output is 284,000 tons (a twofold increase compared to last year's output), which can supply approximately 70,000 households for one year, basically solving the contradiction of coal supply falling short of demand in the province.
    According to what has already been discovered, Heilongjiang Province's iron ore resources include three locations: Mashan in Jixi, Wuying in Yichun, and Fuxing Village in Linkou, with ore reserves of 300,000 tons. According to the national requirement that all regions should be as self-sufficient as possible in pig iron in the future, Heilongjiang Province will utilize the above-mentioned ore from the three locations and the existing equipment of the Jixi Chengzihe Iron Smelting Plant, and will supply coke from the Jixi Coal Mine to resume production. Currently, this iron smelting plant is being constructed. According to the current equipment capacity, it can produce 20,000 tons of pig iron annually. After it is put into production next year, the vast majority of the province's annual pig iron needs can be met.
    Heilongjiang Province is one of the provinces with the richest gold resources. Gold has been produced in more than twenty counties throughout the province. Before liberation, the highest annual output, in the Heihe area alone, reached 120,000 taels. After liberation, gold production was in a state of laissez-faire. Except for Aihui, Huma, Jiayin, and Luobei counties, which persisted in production, the remaining counties successively ceased production. In view of the fact that gold is an important means of payment in international trade, and the state has repeatedly emphasized the importance of gold production, Heilongjiang Province has decided this year to invest 710,000 yuan to expand the Handaqi, Wulaju, Huma, and Luobei gold mines, and to restore the Linkou, Muling, Huachuan, Tangyuan, Baoqing, Jixian, and Dongning gold mines. The total annual gold production will be 15,054 taels, an increase of 51.4% compared to the planned target set at the beginning of the year.
    Non-metallic raw materials, such as graphite, quartz, and fluorite, which are important export commodities, are also currently having shafts constructed. The graphite mine in Jixi has an ore grade of over 85%. After being put into production, the annual output will be 3,300 to 4,000 tons. The quartz ore, which is used to manufacture high-grade glass raw materials, is currently having a factory built in Wuchang. After being put into production, the products can not only be exported in large quantities, but also solve the raw material needs of the four glass factories in the province locally. The fluorite mine, which is used as a smelting flux, will be officially put into production in September, with an annual output of 1,500 tons. The vast majority of the products will be exported to earn foreign exchange.

### 积极利用煤铁黄金等各种资源　黑龙江省开发小型矿藏

　　积极利用煤铁黄金等各种资源
　　黑龙江省开发小型矿藏
    本报哈尔滨讯　记者康伟中报道：今年黑龙江省花费大批投资用于开发小型矿藏。目前省内虽有全国有名的鹤岗、双鸭山、鸡西等大型煤矿，但由于建设事业的发展，煤炭仍感供不应求。为解决这个问题，省工业厅先后在勃利、穆棱、宝清、林口、桦川、五常和黑河等地区，新建和扩建了八个小型煤矿。今年开采小窑煤的全部投资是七十万元，煤的年产量是二十八万四千吨（比去年产量增加一倍），可以供应七万户左右人家烧一年，基本上解决了省内煤炭供不应求的矛盾。
    黑龙江省的铁矿资源，据已发现的有鸡西的麻山、伊春的五营、林口的复兴村三处，矿石储量有三十万吨。根据国家要求各地今后生铁尽可能自给自足的原则，黑龙江省将利用上述三地矿石和现有鸡西城子河炼铁厂原有设备，并由鸡西煤矿供应焦炭，以恢复生产。目前这个炼铁厂正在着手修建。按现有的设备能力，年可炼出生铁两万吨，明年投入生产后，全省每年生铁的需要量绝大部分可以得到满足。
    黑龙江省是黄金资源最丰富的省份之一，全省有二十多个县产过黄金。解放前最高年产量，仅黑河地区即达十二万两。解放后，黄金生产处于自流状态，除爱珲、呼玛、嘉荫、萝北四县坚持生产外，其余各县均先后停产。鉴于黄金是国际贸易的重要支付手段，国家一再提出要重视黄金生产，今年黑龙江省决定投资七十一万元，用于扩建罕达汽、乌拉具、呼玛、萝北四个金矿，恢复林口、穆棱、桦川、汤原、宝清、集贤、东宁七个金矿。全年生产黄金一万五千零五十四两，较年初定的计划增加51.4％。
    作为重要出口物资的非金属原材料——石墨、石英和萤石矿产，目前也正在建井。鸡西的石墨矿，矿石品位达到85％以上，投入生产后，年产量三千三百吨至四千吨。制造高级玻璃原料的石英矿石，目前正在五常建厂，投入生产后，产品不仅可以大量出口，也可就地解决本省四个玻璃厂原料的需要。作冶炼融剂用的萤石矿，9月间即可正式投入生产，年产量一千五百吨，绝大部分产品将出口换取外汇。
