    Changing the State of Lull and Inaction
    The Preparatory Committee of the Kunming Branch of the Jiusan Society Criticizes Qin Zan
    (Our newspaper's dispatch) Since the start of the rectification campaign, Qin Zan, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Kunming Branch of the Jiusan Society and Professor of the Economics Department of Yunnan University, has repeatedly made extremely erroneous statements. However, the Preparatory Committee of the Kunming Branch of the Jiusan Society has remained in a state of lull and inaction, only beginning a more vigorous struggle against rightists at the end of June.
    Qin Zan told a reporter from the Yunnan Daily about the various reasons for the poor relationship between the Party and the masses, saying that in addition to "Party members being arrogant, complacent, conceited, sectarian, bureaucratic, and subjective," it should also be viewed "from a system and method." According to his analysis: "Too many movements have been carried out!..."
    He even slandered the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement as "making accusations based on hearsay," analyzing personnel files as if it were "Zhuge Liang debating with Confucian scholars." He also believed that the cost of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement was too high, and if the cost and gains were used to measure the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, what would the result be? He also expressed doubt, and he also believed that the "walls" and "ditches" created by these movements "cannot be eliminated today, nor will they be eliminated in the future." Qin Zan also attacked the current personnel system, believing that this was also one of the reasons for the "walls" and "ditches."
    At some meetings held by the Preparatory Committee of the Kunming Branch of the Jiusan Society, after everyone's exposure and criticism, Qin Zan made several self-criticisms, but he always avoided the important points and dwelt on the minor ones.
    At the meeting, in addition to demanding that he thoroughly examine his reactionary remarks, it was also pointed out that he had direct and indirect relationships with rightist elements such as Fei Xiaotong and Chu Anping, and he was also asked to make a thorough confession.

    改变偃旗息鼓按兵不动的状态
    昆明分社筹委会批判秦瓒
    本报讯　九三学社昆明分社筹委会主任委员、云南大学经济系教授秦瓒在整风开始以来，一再发表极端错误的言论，但九三学社昆明分社筹委会却一直偃旗息鼓，按兵不动，直到6月底才开始了较有声势的反右派的斗争。
    秦瓒曾向云南日报记者谈到造成党群关系不好的种种原因，除了“党员骄傲自满、自高自大、宗派主义、官僚主义、主观主义”以外，还应该“从一种制度、办法上来看”，据他的分析就是：“运动搞得太多了！……”
    他甚至污蔑肃反运动是在“捕风捉影”，分析人事材料就像是“诸葛亮舌战群儒”一样，他还认为肃反运动的成本太大，要以成本和收获来衡量肃反的话，到底怎样？他还表示怀疑，他还认为这些运动所造成的“墙”和“沟”，“不但今天消灭不了，就是将来也消灭不了”。秦瓒还攻击现行的人事制度，他认为这也是造成“墙”和“沟”的原因之一。
    在九三学社昆明分社筹委会召开的一些会议上，经过大家的揭发和批判以后，秦瓒虽先后作了几次检讨，但始终避重就轻。
    会上，除要求他深入检查自己的反动言论，还指出他和费孝通、储安平等右派分子直接、间接的关系，要他也作彻底的交代。
