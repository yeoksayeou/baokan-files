    Regarding my article “Sketches of the Siming Mountains,” published on page 8 of the People's Daily on June 21st, Comrade Wei Fuhai from the Yuyao County Handicraft Production Cooperative in Zhejiang Province wrote to point out that the Nanshan Bamboo Mat Production Cooperative's daily labor income is 1.40 yuan. The 1.94 yuan is the income from making one bamboo mat. This point may have been incorrectly recorded in my notes. His correction is correct. He also said that generally, cooperative members have added new cotton quilts to their homes, so it's not appropriate to say that all the quilt covers are silk. On this point, I want to clarify that I did not say that all cooperative members' quilt covers are silk. I only said that the two places where I took a nap and slept at night had silk quilt covers. Could his corrections be clarified in the newspaper?

    6月21日在人民日报第八版发表的“四明山区速写”一文有浙江余姚县手工业生产联社的魏福海同志来信指正说南山篾簟生产合作社每个劳动日是一元四角。一元九角四分乃是做成一张篾簟所得的收入。这点许是我的笔记记错了。他的指正是对的。又说一般社员家里都添上了新棉被，不应说盖的被面全是绸的。这点我要申明一下，我也没有说，所有社员的被面全是绸的，我只是说我午睡和夜间睡的两个地方，盖的被面全是绸的。他的指正，可否在报上申明一下？
