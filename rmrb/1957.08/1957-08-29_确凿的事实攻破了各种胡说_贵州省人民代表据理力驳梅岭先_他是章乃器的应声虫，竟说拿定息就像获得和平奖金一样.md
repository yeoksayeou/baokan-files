　　This newspaper reports: At a group meeting of the Guiyang City representatives of the Guizhou Provincial People's Congress, the fallacies of rightist Mei Lingxian, deputy chairman and secretary-general of the Guiyang City Democratic National Construction Association and deputy chairman of the Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, were criticized.
　　Che Min, Deputy Director of the Commercial Department, said: Mei Lingxian said that socialism is not as good as capitalism because capitalism can guarantee supply, while socialism creates a situation of tight supply of materials. This is a complete reversal of black and white. We can look at it from the commercial aspect to see if socialism is good. In 1956, the social purchasing power of our province increased by 31.24% compared with 1955. The sales of state-owned companies under the Commercial Department this year increased by 55.58% compared with 1955. This is a phenomenon that is impossible in capitalist society. Then, Che Min listed the supply of several important industrial products such as edible salt, sugar, cotton cloth, rubber shoes, socks, and pens. Among them, the supply of socks had the smallest increase, but the supply in 1956 was 230.69% of that in 1952. The largest increase was in rubber shoes, which only supplied more than 99,000 pairs in 1952, but increased to more than 1.39 million pairs in 1956, an increase of nearly ten times. Che Min said: This situation reflects that the lives of the people in our province are improving in an all-round way. However, Mei Lingxian seized on the phenomenon that some commodities were temporarily in short supply due to the increase in people's purchasing power and slandered socialism as not as good as capitalism. Isn't this a preposterous reversal of black and white?
　　Liu Heming, Deputy Director of the Department of Agriculture, said: Mei Lingxian said that the Party only pays attention to farmers when striving for a bumper harvest. This is simply nonsense. The Party has always attached importance to farmers. The land reform, cooperativization, and improvement of technology were all done by the Party leading the farmers. Our province holds agricultural labor model conferences every year to encourage farmers' enthusiasm for production and exchange production experience; the Party and the government have also trained a large number of agricultural cadres and established agricultural schools. The animal husbandry of our province has also developed greatly under the leadership of the Party. Thirty animal husbandry stations have been established since liberation. Mei Lingxian's intention in spreading this fallacy is obviously to undermine the worker-peasant alliance.
　　Many representatives and attendees disagreed with Mei Lingxian's "self-criticism". Mao Tieqiao, a representative of industrialists and businessmen, said: Regarding the issue of the dual nature of the bourgeoisie, didn't you agree with Zhang Naiqi's so-called "red bourgeoisie"? Now you say that your mistake only lies in not fulfilling your responsibility to educate members, which is clearly an attempt to shirk responsibility. Some representatives also exposed how Mei Lingxian elaborated on Zhang Naiqi's fallacies. Wu Xinzhai, director of the service hall and an attendee, pointed out: Zhang Naiqi said that fixed interest is not exploitation but unearned income, and Mei Lingxian further said that receiving fixed interest is like receiving a Stalin Peace Prize. This is an example of elaborating on Zhang Naiqi's fallacies. Wu Xinzhai analyzed the essence of Mei Lingxian's obliteration of the boundary between the working class and the bourgeoisie and denial of the dual nature of the bourgeoisie, believing that he was ultimately opposing the working class and the leadership of the Party.

    确凿的事实攻破了各种胡说
　　贵州省人民代表据理力驳梅岭先
　　他是章乃器的应声虫，竟说拿定息就像获得和平奖金一样
    本报讯　在贵州省人民代表大会贵阳市代表的小组会上，对右派分子、民建贵阳市副主委兼秘书长、省工商联副主委梅岭先的谬论进行批判。
    商业厅副厅长车民说：梅岭先说社会主义不如资本主义，因为资本主义能够保证供应，而社会主义却产生物资供应紧张现象。这完全是故意颠倒黑白。我们可以从商业方面看一看，看社会主义是不是好。1956年，我省社会购买力比1955年增长了31.24％。本年商业厅所属国营公司的销售额比1955年增长了55.58％。这是在资本主义社会里不可能有的现象。接着，车民列举几种重要工业品如食盐、食糖、棉布、胶鞋、袜子、钢笔等的供应情况，其中，供应量增长幅度最小的是袜子，但1956年的供应量也为1952年的230.69％；增长幅度最大的如胶鞋，1952年只供应九万九千多双，1956年则增加到供应一百三十九万多双，增加将近十倍。车民说：这种情况，反映出我省人民生活是在全面改善着。但是梅岭先却抓着因人民购买力提高，某些商品一时供不应求的现象，诬蔑说社会主义不如资本主义。这不是颠倒黑白的胡说是什么？
    农业厅副厅长刘鹤鸣说：梅岭先说党只有在争取大丰收的时候才重视农民。这简直是胡说。党始终是重视农民的。搞土地改革、合作化、改良技术，都是党领导农民做的。我们省年年开农业劳动模范大会，鼓励农民的生产积极性、交流生产经验；党和政府还培养了大批的农业干部，设立了农业学校。我省畜牧业在党的领导下也有了很大的发展，解放以来已建立了三十个畜牧站。梅岭先散布这种谬论的用意显然是破坏工农联盟。
    许多代表和列席人员都不同意梅岭先的“检讨”。工商业者毛铁桥代表说：关于资产阶级两面性的问题，你不是很同意章乃器的所谓“红色资产阶级”的说法吗？现在你说什么你的过错只在于没有尽到教育成员的责任而已，这明明是在企图推卸责任。有些代表还揭发了梅岭先如何发挥了章乃器的谬论。列席人员服务厅厅长吴欣斋指出：章乃器说定息不是剥削，而是不劳而获的收入，梅岭先就更进一步地说，拿定息就像获得斯大林和平奖金一样，这就是发挥了章乃器的谬论的一个例子。吴欣斋分析梅岭先抹煞工人阶级与资产阶级的界限、否认资产阶级两面性的实质，认为他归根结底是在反对工人阶级和党的领导。
