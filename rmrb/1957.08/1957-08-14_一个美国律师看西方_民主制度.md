An American Lawyer Looks at the Western "Democratic System"
By: Shābōlǐ, American

During the rectification campaign, rightists, under the guise of helping the Party in its rectification, attacked the government system and management methods, insisting that they were inferior to the "Western democratic system." They claimed that the Western democratic system was "absolutely" democratic, meaning it gave equal rights to all classes, and for this reason, China should adopt this most ideal form of democracy.

I am an American. Before coming to China, I practiced law in New York City for several years. I would like to offer my perspective on the current "Western democratic system" in the United States, especially on some of the democratic forms that rightists are praising so highly.

Bicameral System

The United States Congress is composed of two houses: the House of Representatives and the Senate. Representatives are elected according to the population of each state; each state is entitled to elect two senators. Any proposal must pass both houses before it becomes law. Therefore, a monopoly enterprise, by simply buying off two senators from a certain state, wields the same power as the thirty to forty representatives from that state. Buying off senators is so common and well-known that newspapers often openly refer to them as "the silver mining senator from Nevada" or "the oil senator from Oklahoma," based on the corporate interests these legislators represent. Occasionally, due to strong public pressure, the House of Representatives has to pass a bill that is slightly beneficial to the people. At this time, the Senate, as the spokesperson for big business, either amends the bill beyond recognition or simply vetoes it.

Government Cabinet

This is equivalent to the "political design institute" suggested by the rightists. Cabinet members are chosen by the President himself, and they are mostly senior leaders of the largest monopoly companies. Eisenhower's cabinet was called the "Cadillac Cabinet" (Cadillac is the most luxurious car in the United States, affordable only to the very wealthy). In addition to participating in the formulation of important government policies, cabinet members also serve as ministers. They use their government authority to ensure the maximum benefit for the enterprises they represent.

Judicial Procedures

In the United States, litigation is a very expensive procedure. For ordinary American citizens, even if the law is on their side, very few can afford to go to court. In criminal cases, the difficulties for ordinary Americans are even greater, as they not only face financial difficulties but also the risk of losing their freedom. Everything costs money—preparation for the lawsuit, the lawsuit itself, and possible appeals. The case of Powell, his wife Silva, and Schumann (who published the "Millard's Review" in Shanghai and faithfully reported the crimes of the American armed forces during the Korean War, and are therefore currently persecuted in the United States) has not yet been tried, but has already cost $30,000, with an additional debt of $9,000. The reactionary American government deliberately makes things difficult for American progressives, using costly criminal procedures to drive them into bankruptcy, thereby weakening their ability to participate in political activities.

"Investigations" led by various congressional committees (often targeting progressive forces fighting against reactionary forces) are actually a form of litigation procedure and are strongly class-oriented. These committees, under the pretext of gathering facts for legislative work (such as depriving the Communist Party of its legal status), subpoena anyone with a hint of progressive leanings and force them to answer questions about their political beliefs and social relationships. If he answers one question, according to American law, he must "open the door," so if he refuses to answer the next question, he is guilty of "contempt of Congress" and may be sent to prison.

Of course, he can invoke the Constitution to refuse to answer any questions, because the Constitution stipulates that no one can be forced to make statements that are detrimental to himself (which the court has interpreted as meaning that he can refuse to say anything that might be detrimental to himself in future criminal proceedings). But when he exercises his constitutional rights, he is ridiculed by the committee members, as if his refusal to answer questions proves that he is trying to hide the political crimes he has committed. Due to the extensive publicity given to these investigations by newspapers and the nationwide broadcasts on television, the person is usually fired because no company dares to hire someone whose "loyalty" to the capitalist system is in doubt.

Personnel Departments

The rightists complain that China's personnel departments place too much emphasis on political conditions. They suggest abolishing this department. Since they are so fond of the "Western democratic system," they should understand that in capitalist countries, all government or private enterprises have personnel departments and pay special attention to the political background of employees. The personnel departments in the United States cooperate closely with the FBI, some congressional "investigating committees," and labor spies and informers who are sent among the workers. Anyone suspected of having "dangerous" (i.e., progressive) ideas or activities will be fired. He has no opportunity to confront the witnesses who framed him, and more often than not, he does not even know the reason for his dismissal. If he is a member of a strong labor union, he may receive support from the union. But usually union leaders (many of whom are right-leaning opportunists) prefer not to interfere in "political" cases. The dismissed person is blacklisted, and no company will ever hire him again.

Blacklists also exist for American intellectuals. In the past decade, many professors, journalists, radio and theater workers have been fired en masse for not "cooperating" with congressional committees (refusing to identify their colleagues or friends as secret communists). They have also been blacklisted by the personnel departments of various units in their industries, so they never have the chance to find work again. In 1950, nine of America's best screenwriters and directors were sentenced to one year in prison for refusing to answer questions from the House Un-American Activities Committee about whether they were communists. Since then, no major film company has dared to hire them again (these companies recently made fools of themselves when they discovered that at least two films that won Hollywood's highest artistic awards were written and sold to them under pseudonyms by writers on the blacklist).

* * *

So much for the "freedom" and "absolute democracy" of capitalist countries. The "Western democratic system" is a means, not an end, and it serves the capitalist economic base. All the facts prove that it is a tool for oppressing the people and maintaining the rule of monopoly capital.

    一个美国律师看西方“民主制度”
    美国　沙博理
    整风运动中，右派分子在帮助党整风的伪装下，对政府制度和管理方法进行攻击，硬说它们比不上
  “西方民主制度”。他们说，西方民主制度才是“绝对”的民主，换句话说，它给各个阶级以平等权利，由于这种原因，中国应该采取这种最为理想的民主形式。
    我是一个美国人。未到中国之前，在纽约市当了几年律师。我愿意将美国现行的“西方民主制度”，特别是右派分子大加赞扬的一些民主形式，提供我的看法。
    两院制
    美国国会由两院组成：众议院和参议院。众议员按照各州人口比例选出；参议员每州规定选举两名。任何提案变成法律之前，必须在两院通过。因此，垄断企业只要收买某一州的两名参议员，他所支配的力量，就和该州为数三十至四十名的众议员相等。收买参议员是如此的普通和家喻户晓，以致报纸上常常根据这些议员所代表的企业利益，公开地称他们为“内华达州的银矿参议员”，或“俄克拉荷马州的石油参议员”。偶而由于公众压力很大，众议院不得不通过对人民稍为有利的法案，这时候，作为大企业发言人的参议院，不是将法案修改得支离破碎，就是干脆否决。
    政府内阁
    它相当于右派分子建议的“政治设计院”。阁员由总统自己选择，他们大都是最大的垄断公司高级领导人。艾森豪威尔的内阁被称为“卡迪来克内阁”（卡迪来克是美国最豪贵的汽车，只有非常富有的人才购得起）。阁员除参加拟订政府的重要政策外，同时还担任部长。他们利用政府职权，保证他们所代表的企业的最大限度的利益。
    司法程序
    在美国，诉讼是一件很费钱的手续。对普通美国公民来说，即使法律对他们有利，也只有极少数人打得起官司。若是刑事案件，一般的美国人的困难就更大，他不仅有经济困难，并且还有丧失自由的危险。每一件事都要花钱——诉讼的准备，诉讼本身以及可能的上诉等。鲍威尔，他的妻子席尔瓦和舒曼（他们曾在上海出版“密勒氏评论报”，忠实地报道了在朝鲜战争时期美国武装部队的罪行，因此目前在美国受到迫害）的案件尚未审判，可是已经花去三万美元，另外还负债九千美元。美国反动政府故意和美国进步人士为难，用花钱的刑事手续来驱使他们破产，从而削弱他们参加政治活动的能力。
    形形色色的国会委员会领导下的“调查”（常常对准向反动势力作斗争的进步力量），实际上就是诉讼手续的一种形式，并且带有强烈的阶级气息。这些委员会借口为立法工作（例如剥夺共产党合法地位）收集事实，传讯任何有一点进步嫌疑的人，并且强迫他回答自己的政治信仰和社会关系。假如他回答了一个问题，依照美国的法律，他必须“开门”，因此如果他拒绝回答下一个问题，就犯了“藐视国会”的罪行，可能被送入狱。
    当然，他可以引用宪法来拒绝答复任何问题，因为宪法上规定不能强迫任何人作出对自己不利的声明（这一点法院曾作解释，就是他可以拒绝说出一些可能在未来刑事诉讼中不利于自己的话）。可是当他行使宪法权利时，就会受到委员会委员的讥嘲，似乎他拒绝回答问题，恰好证明了他是企图隐瞒所犯的政治罪行。由于报纸对这类调查大肆宣扬，同时电视节目也向全国播送，这个人通常被解雇，因为没有一家公司敢雇用一个对资本主义制度的“忠诚”受到怀疑的人。
    人事部门
    右派分子抱怨中国的人事部门过于强调政治条件。他们建议取消这一部门。既然他们如此喜爱“西方民主制度”，就应当了解在资本主义国家里，所有的政府或私人的企业，都设有人事部门，并且还特别注意雇用人员的政治背景。美国的人事部门，同联邦调查局、国会的一些“调查委员会”以及派到工人中间的工贼和告密者密切合作。任何一个人只要被怀疑有“危险的”（即进步的）思想或活动，他就会被开除。他没有机会和陷害他的证人对质，更多的情况是他自己根本不知道被开除的原因。如果他是一个强大的工会的会员，也许会得到工会支持。但是通常工会领袖（许多是右倾机会主义者）宁可不干涉“政治性”案件。被开除的人被列入黑名单，再也没有一家公司愿意雇用他。
    对美国的知识分子也开有黑名单。过去十年中，许多教授、记者、电台及戏剧工作者，因为没有同国会的委员会“合作”（拒绝指出他的同事或朋友是秘密的共产党员），而大批被开除。他们还被本行业各单位的人事部门列入黑名单上，这样就永远没有机会再找到工作。1950年，九个美国最优秀的电影编剧和导演，因为拒绝答复众议院“非美活动调查委员会”提出的他们是否共产党员的问题，而被判入狱一年。此后，没有一家大电影公司敢于再雇用他们（这些公司最近闹了笑话，因为发现至少有两部以上获得好莱坞最高艺术奖的电影，是黑名单上的作家用假名编写并卖给它们的）。
            ＊  ＊  ＊
    关于资本主义国家的“自由”和“绝对民主”就谈到这里。“西方民主制度”是一种手段，并不是目的，它为资本主义的经济基础服务。全部的事实都证明，它是压迫人民和维持垄断资本统治的工具。
