Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, August 8th (Xinhua Reporter Xiao Chunmao): The China People's Construction Bank Hohhot Branch, which was once thrown into chaos and its work almost paralyzed by a handful of rightist elements, has taken on a completely new look with the rise of righteousness after the anti-rightist struggle.

Currently, the leadership of this branch is seriously addressing pressing issues based on the opinions raised by the staff during the rectification movement. In the past, the various departments were often unable to complete their tasks due to inconsistent steps and mutual buck-passing. Now, the relationships between the various sections have normalized, and even the Appropriation Section Two, which was once controlled by rightist elements, has completed the inspection of the investment, appropriation, and utilization plans that should have been completed at the beginning of the year within the past week. The employees' labor discipline and sense of responsibility have been strengthened compared to the past. After eliminating the negative sentiment of uneasiness in their work, field personnel have gone deep into the worksites and have discovered many important issues related to project construction, such as the fact that the construction area of the Inner Mongolia Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Science is higher than practically needed, and that the Inner Mongolia Trade Union Sanatorium project has extravagance and waste.

The China People's Construction Bank Hohhot Branch began the rectification movement as early as January. At that time, Yang Zhijiang, the vice chairman of the branch's trade union, and other rightist elements took advantage of the weakness of political and ideological work within the bank and the lack of clarity on certain issues among some of the masses to launch an attack on the branch leadership. Under the instigation of the rightist elements, the phenomenon of "five more" and "two no questions" once appeared in the bank: more people seeing doctors, more people asking for leave, more people arriving late and leaving early, more people visiting other sections to chat during work hours, more people having ideological problems and concerns about personal treatment; no questions about politics, no questions about work. Yang Zhijiang called it "different forms of strike."

In early July, just as this small group of rightist elements was gloating, the branch employees demanded that the rectification leading group immediately launch a reasoning struggle against the rightist elements. At the debate held in the branch, the employees sternly refuted the lies of Yang Zhijiang and others who distorted the suppression of counter-revolutionaries policy. The employees, who had once been deceived by rightist rhetoric, all expressed their determination to stand firm and fight the rightist elements to the end.

The criminal activities of the rightist elements have been exposed, and Yang Zhijiang has admitted his mistakes in a public meeting.

    呼和浩特中国人民建设银行支行
    打垮右派正气上升
    工作面貌焕然一新
    据新华社呼和浩特8日电　新华社记者校春茂报道：曾经被一小撮右派分子闹得乌烟瘴气、工作几乎陷于瘫痪的中国人民建设银行呼和浩特支行，经过反右派的斗争以后，正气上升，面貌焕然一新。
    目前这个支行领导上正根据职工群众在整风中提出的意见，认真处理当前急需解决的问题。过去各部门之间由于步调不一，互相扯皮，任务经常不能完成。现在各科室的关系已经正常，连一度被右派分子掌握领导权的拨款二科，在最近一周内也已完成了在今年年初就该完成的投资、拨款、动用三项计划的检查工作。现在职工们的劳动纪律、工作责任心都比过去加强。外勤人员消除了不安心工作的消极情绪后，纷纷深入现场，已发现许多有关工程建设方面的重要问题，如内蒙古畜牧兽医科学研究所建筑面积高于实用的问题，内蒙古工会结核疗养院工程有铺张浪费现象等。
    中国人民建设银行呼和浩特支行早在1月间就开始整风，当时支行工会副主席杨之江和其他几个右派分子利用行内政治思想工作薄弱、部分群众在某些问题上是非不清的弱点，向支行领导上展开进攻。在右派分子的煽动下，行里一度出现了“五多”和“两不问”的现象：看病的多、请假的多、迟到早退的多、工作时间到各科串门子聊天的多、闹思想问题和个人待遇的多；不问政治，不问工作。杨之江称之为“不同形式的罢工”。
    7月初，正当这一小撮右派分子得意忘形的时候，支行职工纷纷要求整风领导小组立即对右派分子展开说理斗争。在支行举行的辩论会上，职工们对杨之江等歪曲肃反政策的谎言，作了严正的驳斥。一度被右派言论所蒙蔽的职工们，都表示要站稳立场，和右派分子斗争到底。
    右派分子的罪恶活动被揭穿，杨之江已在大会上承认了自己的错误。
