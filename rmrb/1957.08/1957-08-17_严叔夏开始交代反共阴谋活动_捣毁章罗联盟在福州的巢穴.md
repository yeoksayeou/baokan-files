Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 16th: Yan Shuxia, the rightist ringleader of the Fujian Provincial Committee and Fuzhou Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, confessed his conspiracy activities at the joint expanded meeting of the Fujian Provincial Committee and Fuzhou Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League on the afternoon of the 13th.

Yan Shuxia is a standing committee member of the Fujian Provincial Committee and the chairman of the Fuzhou Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League. He said that since last year, he has frequently spread poisonous remarks such as "the intellectuals' ideology has been transformed almost completely." At the same time, he vigorously implemented the Zhang-Luo Alliance's plan to develop organizations, emphasizing that as long as intellectuals have professional abilities, they can be absorbed into the League regardless of their appearance. I planned to more than double the number of League members in Fuzhou this year.

Yan Shuxia said that after I basically controlled the Fuzhou Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, my offensive target turned to universities. Because I believe that first, the Communist Party members in universities have "very few experts," and the Democratic League has favorable conditions in this regard; second, from my personal point of view, leading work in universities can bring both fame and fortune, and I can communicate with universities across the country; third, the graduates of universities every year are future political capital, and as long as universities are developed, other aspects will inevitably be driven forward. Yan Shuxia said that in order to realize their conspiracy, the words and deeds of him and his rightist clique members always slander "Party cadres have low levels, bad work styles, and are divorced from the masses everywhere"; they deliberately do not talk about achievements everywhere, fabricating and exaggerating individual or partial shortcomings; and attack personnel work, slandering that the Party and the state employ university staff based on impressions and qualifications, not "competition of virtue and talent," emphasizing the need for "experts to run schools."

Yan Shuxia also confessed that after the start of the anti-rightist struggle, he and Qian Luzhou, the "military advisor" of the rightist clique, made a pact to advance and retreat together, and examined his consistent two-faced tactics and anti-Communist and anti-socialist essence. He finally expressed his unconditional surrender to the people and requested permission to be a new man.

    严叔夏开始交代反共阴谋活动
    捣毁章罗联盟在福州的巢穴
    据新华社福州16日电  民盟福建省委和福州市委的右派头目严叔夏，13日下午在民盟福建省委和福州市委联席扩大会议上，交代了他的阴谋活动。
    严叔夏是民盟福建省委常务委员、福州市委主任委员。他说，从去年以来，我经常散布“知识分子的思想已改造得差不多了”等有毒素的言论，同时还大力执行章罗联盟发展组织的计划，强调只要是有业务能力的知识分子，不管他们的面目如何都可吸收入盟。我打算今年把福州市的盟员发展一倍多。
    严叔夏说，当我基本上控制了福州市的民盟组织以后，我的进攻目标就转向高等学校。因为我认为，首先高等学校中的共产党员“内行极少”，民盟在这方面有有利条件；其次，从我个人来说，作高等学校的领导工作可以名利双收，可以和全国高等学校通声气；第三，高等学校每年的毕业生都是将来的政治资本，只要高等学校搞起来了，其他方面也必定可以带动起来。严叔夏说，为了实现他们的阴谋，他和他的右派小集团成员的言行中总是到处污蔑“党员干部水平低、作风恶劣、脱离群众”；处处故意不谈成绩，捏造和夸大个别或部分缺点；并攻击人事工作，污蔑党和国家任用高等学校工作人员是凭印象、凭资格，不是“德才竞赛”，强调要“内行办校”。
    严叔夏并交代了在反右派斗争开始后，他和右派小集团的“军师”钱履周订攻守同盟的情况，并检查了他一贯要两面派的恶劣手段和反共反社会主义的本质。他最后表示无条件向人民投降，请求允许他重新做人。
