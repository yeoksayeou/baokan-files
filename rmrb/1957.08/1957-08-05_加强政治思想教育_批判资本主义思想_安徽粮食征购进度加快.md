Anhui Province (via this newspaper): After political and ideological education, farmers in Anhui province have begun to actively support the state's grain procurement work. The progress of grain procurement throughout the province is gradually accelerating. In mid-July, the average daily procurement was 7 million jin, and by late July, it had increased to an average of 10.5 million jin. It continues to increase.

Anhui Province's summer grain output this year is close to that of the bumper year of 1955, and the procurement task is lower than in 1955, but the progress of procurement is much slower than in 1955. The main reason is that capitalist ideology is raising its head again in the countryside. The phenomena of concealing output, falsely reporting population to retain more food rations, privately distributing grain, and not actively handing over public grain and selling surplus grain are widespread. Many grassroots cadres in the countryside, simply for the sake of good work in the future, do not promptly stop these phenomena. This has affected the grain procurement work.

In response to this situation, relevant departments in Anhui Province have universally launched political and ideological education work for cadres and farmers in the rural areas. Using the method of recollection and comparison and detailed accounting, they enlightened and educated farmers to actively hand over public grain and sell surplus grain, support farmers in disaster areas, and support socialist construction. Currently, the situation in rural areas is beginning to improve. Many cooperatives have admitted the fact of concealing output and have reported the output truthfully. For example, the Xingxing Agricultural Cooperative in Shou County originally reported an output of 2.1 million jin, and supplemented the report with 230,000 jin. Some cooperatives admitted to falsely reporting population. For example, the Jiulong Cooperative in Shou County had 4,934 people but reported 5,336, thus greatly increasing summer food rations. In Hucheng Township, Feidong County, the township originally requested the county to supply 60,000 jin of grain to the entire township in July and August before the mid-season rice was harvested. After ideological education, not only did they not request a supply, but they also sold 90,000 jin of surplus grain to the state.

### 加强政治思想教育　批判资本主义思想  安徽粮食征购进度加快

    加强政治思想教育　批判资本主义思想
    安徽粮食征购进度加快
    本报合肥4日电　安徽省农民经过政治思想教育，开始积极支持国家的粮食征购工作。全省粮食征购进度逐渐加快，7月中旬平均每天征购七百万斤，7月下旬已增加到平均每天一千零五十万斤。目前还在继续增加。
    安徽省今年夏粮产量接近丰收的1955年的产量，征购任务比1955年低，但征购的进度却比1955年迟缓得多。主要原因是农村中的资本主义思想又在抬头。隐瞒产量、谎报人口多留口粮、私分粮食、不积极交公粮和卖余粮的现象普遍发生。农村中的许多基层干部，也单纯地为了今后好工作，对这些现象不及时制止。这就影响了粮食征购工作。
    针对这种情况，安徽省有关部门在全省农村中普遍展开了对干部和农民的政治思想教育工作。用回忆对比和算细账的办法，启发和教育农民积极交公粮卖余粮，支援灾区农民，支援社会主义建设。目前，农村情况开始好转。许多合作社承认了隐瞒产量的事实，并据实补报了产量。如寿县星星农业社原报产量二百一十万斤，补报产量二十三万斤。有的社承认谎报人口，如寿县九龙社有四千九百三十四人，报了五千三百三十六人，因此大大增加了夏季留粮。肥东县护城乡，原要求县里在7、8月中稻未收前供应全乡粮食六万斤，经过思想教育后，不但不要求供应，还卖给国家余粮九万斤。
