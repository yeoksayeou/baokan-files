Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, August 12th: The anti-rightist struggle in Zhejiang Province's higher education institutions has achieved a significant victory.

Dong Taihe, a professor at Zhejiang University and a rightist, tried his best to advocate for "professors governing the university" and even shouted that "Marxism-Leninism is worthless dogma." He fabricated rumors, saying that "the Communist Party not only sees intellectuals as 'retainers' but also treats them as 'criminals' to be criticized in every movement." He reversed black and white, saying that the new China was full of "darkness," slandered the National People's Congress as a "formal institution," and said that Zhejiang University after the departmental adjustments was a "technical training class."

Zhou Xianyi, another rightist backbone element and lecturer in the Mathematics Teaching and Research Group at Zhejiang University, even spread rumors that the current Zhejiang University had become a bureaucratic yamen. He directly incited students to cause trouble, telling them to "seize major issues" (such as driving out the school's Party committee) and to "strike at the Communist Party's vitals" in one fell swoop.

Zhejiang University also saw the incident of rightists such as Huang Yuede causing trouble at the Hangzhou Daily, attempting to escalate the matter and then march together in demonstrations. The core organization of the rightists at Zhejiang University was the "Spring Thunder" anti-Party clique, whose main members included Wu Longyan, Bao Dewei, Li Dejin, Shi Xiaocheng, and Zhu Wenwei.

At Zhejiang Agricultural College, Shi Youguang emerged as a bourgeois rightist general, putting forward a set of reactionary programs during the blooming and contending period. He painstakingly summed up the so-called "Ten Evil Winds of Party Members, League Members, and Activists" and "Four Types of Fake Activists," slandering Party and League members to the extreme. Shi Youguang, however, hypocritically championed the cause of farmers, spreading rumors that farmers were "not getting enough to eat."

During this period, some lecturers and teaching assistants at Zhejiang Agricultural College, such as Ma Jian, Shi Ya夫, and Lu Dingzhi, rightists who had previously been loyal to Chiang Kai-shek's secret service, were attacking the Communist Party and the socialist cause day and night, neglecting sleep and food, making the Agricultural College seem to be in a state of "imminent collapse."

During the blooming and contending period, Zhejiang Medical College was also filled with dark clouds. Rightist Chu Hao faithfully implemented the anti-Communist and anti-socialist political program of the Zhang-Luo alliance and the Zhejiang Minmeng rightists, clamoring wildly everywhere that "the school should abolish the Party committee's leadership system." In this flurry of dark clouds, teachers Zhu Shoumin, Shao Jingyu, Lu Bozheng, Qin Wenqing, and students Zhang Qizheng, Liu Kang, Chen Qianping, Xu Jianhua, Wang Yaohua, and other rightists also somersaulted wildly.

At Zhejiang Normal College, Ren Mingshan, the deputy director of academic affairs and a rightist, insisted that "destruction has been greater than construction in the past eight years." He called for a "hurricane" rectification campaign, calling for more "knock-down-drag-out" opinions to be raised. Another rightist at this college, Wang Chengji, the head of the Chemistry Department, incited some teachers and students to directly drive the Party committee out of the school. He incited students to make as much trouble as possible.

Mo Pu, Jin Lang, and Jin Ye, rightists from the East China Branch of the Central Academy of Fine Arts, were all members of an anti-Party clique headed by Jiang Feng.

For more than a month, the broad masses of teachers, students, and staff in Zhejiang's higher education institutions have engaged in fierce debates with the rightists. Huang Weishi, Chen Hongxi, and five other League members from Zhejiang University were commended by the Provincial League Committee and the school's League Committee for bravely defending the cause of the Communist Party and resolutely fighting against the rightists.

    浙江高等学校反右派斗争搞得好
    右派骨干显露原形，积极分子受到表扬
    据新华社杭州12日电　浙江省各高等学校反右派斗争已经获得重大胜利。
    浙江大学教授、右派分子董太和竭力主张“教授治校”，还高喊“马列主义是不值一文的教条”，他造谣说“共产党不仅把知识分子看成是‘门下食客’，而且每次运动中都把他们当作批判的‘罪犯’”。他颠倒黑白地说新中国一片“黑暗”，污蔑人民代表大会是“形式的机构”，说院系调整后的浙江大学是“技术训练班”。
    浙江大学另一个右派骨干分子、数学教研组讲师周先意更造谣说：现在的浙大已成了官僚主义的衙门。他直接鼓动学生起来闹事，叫学生要“抓住重大问题”（如赶出学校党委等），要一举“击中共产党的要害”。
    浙江大学还出现了右派分子黄月德等大闹杭州日报社的事件，他们企图把事情闹大后结队上街，举行示威游行。浙江大学右派分子的核心组织是“春雷”反党集团，其中的主要成员有吴隆延、包德炜、李德进、史孝成、朱文伟等五人。
    浙江农学院里，出现了一员资产阶级右派主将施有光，他在鸣放中提出了一套反动纲领。他费尽心机地归纳出所谓“党团员和积极分子的十大歪风”和“四类假积极分子”，对党团员极尽其污蔑的能事。施有光却假仁慈地为农民抱不平，散布农民“吃不饱”等谣言。
    在这个时期，浙江农学院里的一些过去曾效忠于蒋介石特务机关的讲师、助教如麻键、施亚夫、陆定志等右派分子，更是日日夜夜地、废寝忘食地进攻共产党和社会主义事业，把农学院闹得大有“岌岌不可终日”之势。
    浙江医学院在鸣放期间也是黑云乱翻，右派分子储镐忠实地执行了章罗联盟和浙江民盟右派的反共反社会主义的政治纲领，猖狂地到处叫嚣“学校应该取消党委负责制”。在这股乱翻的黑云里头，大翻跟斗的还有教师朱寿民、邵静宇、陆伯铮、秦文清和学生张齐政、刘康、陈千平、徐建华、王耀华等右派分子。
    在浙江师范学院里，副教务长、右派分子任铭善一口咬定说“八年来破坏多，建设少”，他叫喊必须“狂风暴雨”式的整风，叫喊多提一些“一棍子打死”的意见。这个学院另一右派分子、化学系主任王承基煽动一部分教师和学生想直接把党委会从学校里赶出去。他煽动学生闹事要闹得越大越好。
    中央美术学院华东分院的右派分子莫朴、金浪、金冶，他们都是以江丰为首的一个反党集团的成员。
    一个多月来，浙江各高等学校的广大师生员工们，跟右派分子展开了激烈的争辩。浙江大学团员黄维实、陈鸿喜等七人，由于英勇地捍卫了共产党的事业，坚决和右派分子作斗争，曾分别受到团省委和学校团委的表扬。
