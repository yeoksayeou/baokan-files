    “San Mao Studies Business” Comes to Beijing
    Huaji opera is a unique theatrical genre in Shanghai. Its characteristic is to use laughter as a means to satirize unreasonable things in the old society, so it has a considerable audience in the Shanghai area. This time, the Shanghai Mass Huaji Opera Troupe is touring Beijing, performing plays such as "San Mao Studies Business" and "Making a Scene in the Bridal Chamber."
    "San Mao Studies Business" depicts the various encounters of a poor child growing up in the old society who cannot survive in the countryside and goes to Shanghai to find a job. Through the kind and innocent youth of San Mao, the play exposes and satirizes the various corrupt phenomena of semi-colonial old Shanghai, especially in contrast to today's new society, leaving a deep impression on the audience. The play received good reviews when it was presented to Beijing literary and art circles. (Shu)

    “三毛学生意”到北京
    滑稽戏是上海独有的一个剧种。它的特点是以笑作为手段，来讽刺旧社会中不合理的事物，所以在上海一带拥有不少的观众。这次，上海市大众滑稽剧团巡回演出，来到北京，演出的剧目有：“三毛学生意”、“大闹洞房”等剧。
    “三毛学生意”是描写一个生长在旧社会里的穷苦孩子，在农村里活不下去，到上海找职业的种种遭遇。全剧通过三毛这个善良无邪的青年，揭露和讽刺了半殖民地旧上海形形色色的腐败现象，特别是和今天新社会的对比下，更给观众留下深刻的印象。这个戏招待北京文艺界时，获得了好评。　（澍）
