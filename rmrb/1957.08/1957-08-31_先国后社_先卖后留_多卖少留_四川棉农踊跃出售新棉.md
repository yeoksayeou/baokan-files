Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, August 30th. Sichuan Province's new cotton has begun to enter the market. Since mid-August, cotton in counties such as Jianyang, Renshou, Suining, and Fengjie has gradually matured. Cotton farmers, responding to the people's government's call to "State First, Collective Second," "Sell First, Keep Second," and "Sell More, Keep Less," are picking and ginning cotton while actively selling it to the state.

Approximately fifty centralized stations, distributed throughout the cotton-producing areas of the province, have prepared ample materials such as burlap and steel wire rope, ready to immediately pack and ship the cotton when it arrives from various purchasing stations. Vehicles and ships for transporting cotton have also been arranged.

This year, Sichuan Province's cotton acreage has expanded by more than 200,000 mu, and the unit area yield of cotton has increased by approximately 5% compared to last year. The province's total cotton output is expected to reach approximately 1.4 million dan. If the weather is good during the autumn harvest, it will be possible to exceed the state's purchase plan, in addition to the cotton retained by the farmers themselves.

　　四川棉农踊跃出售新棉
    据新华社成都30日电　四川省新棉开始上市。自8月中旬以来，简阳、仁寿、遂宁、奉节等县的棉花就陆续成熟，棉农们响应人民政府“先国后社”、“先卖后留”、“多卖少留”的号召，边采边轧，踊跃地把棉花卖给国家。
    分布在全省产棉区的约五十个集中站，准备好了充足的麻布、钢丝绳等材料，等各收购点的棉花送到时就立即打包启运。运输棉花的车辆和船只也安排就绪。
    今年四川省棉田面积扩大了二十多万亩，棉花的单位面积产量比去年提高约5％，全省棉花总产量约达一百四十万担。除棉农自己留用的棉花以外，如果秋收时天气好，将可超额完成国家的收购计划。
