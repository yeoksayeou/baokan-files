Shanxi is All Out to Fight Drought and Prepare for Famine
Hunan Simultaneously Focuses on Grain Work and Field Production

    This dispatch from Taiyuan, August 21st: The drought situation in Shanxi Province is becoming increasingly severe, and the struggle against drought has fully unfolded.

    Since the beginning of summer, various crops in the province have grown well, offering hope for a bumper harvest. However, since late July, ground temperatures have risen, and rainfall has been scarce. As of now, with the exception of a few areas that have received rain recently, most parts of the province are experiencing widespread drought. In the most severely affected counties, rainfall from the beginning of June to the present has only reached 50 millimeters. In the more severely affected counties, rainfall from June to the present has been less than 100 millimeters. In the less severely affected counties, there has also been very little rain since mid-July.

    In order to mobilize the people to fight drought and protect seedlings, the Provincial People's Committee issued an emergency directive on August 12th regarding fighting drought to protect seedlings and striving for a bumper harvest of grain and cotton. It called on leaders at all levels and agricultural cooperative members to immediately take action and wage a resolute struggle against the drought. Recently, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China also held a province-wide telephone conference. Tao Lujia, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, instructed the entire province to treat drought resistance and famine preparation as the most central and pressing task in current rural work. He demanded that provincial, prefectural, and county-level agencies immediately dispatch large numbers of cadres to go deep into the countryside to lead the work of drought resistance and famine preparation. All meetings that can be postponed should be temporarily postponed, and all matters that can be delayed should be temporarily delayed, in order to concentrate all efforts on waging the most tenacious struggle against the drought. Comrade Tao Lujia also instructed all localities to fully utilize all existing water conservancy facilities, exploit all water resources that can be exploited, and protect seedlings. In all areas where it is possible to strive for high yields, efforts should be made to accelerate processing and fertilization, and replanting of autumn vegetables, striving for high yields to compensate for losses and support the entire province. People in disaster areas should collect large quantities of wild vegetables to prepare for crossing the famine.

    After the telephone conference, provincial and municipal agency staff, led by Provincial Party Committee First Secretary Tao Lujia, went to suburban agricultural cooperatives in batches to carry water and irrigate seedlings. Leading cadres at the county level and large numbers of staff members have also actively taken action, going deep into the countryside to lead the masses and comprehensively launch the struggle against drought and famine preparation.

    This dispatch: The Party committees at all levels in Hunan Province are strengthening their leadership over the production of autumn harvest crops in conjunction with the grain procurement work, striving for an all-round bumper harvest. Hunan Province has had a bumper harvest of early rice, and a bumper harvest of mid-season rice is also expected. Late rice has been basically transplanted, followed by the planting of buckwheat, mud beans, sweet potatoes, and other autumn and winter crops. Because the province is carrying out a socialist propaganda movement and has begun grain procurement work, some places have relaxed their leadership in the production of autumn and winter crops. Some cooperative cadres believe that because the early and mid-season rice have had bumper harvests, it is not necessary to seize the production of autumn and winter crops; some farmers are afraid that if they grow more miscellaneous grains, the state will purchase more staple grains; and others believe that the season is still early and do not care. In response to the above situation, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed all localities that while carrying out grain work, they must strengthen their leadership over the sowing of autumn and winter crops, and explain to the farmers that the state can purchase more miscellaneous grains from agricultural cooperatives with more miscellaneous grain production to dispel their concerns.

    Now, grain, agriculture and other relevant departments are promoting the production of autumn and winter crops by supplying seeds and strengthening technical guidance and other business work.

### 山西全力抗旱备荒　湖南一面搞好粮食工作　一面抓紧田间生产

　　山西全力抗旱备荒
　　湖南一面搞好粮食工作　一面抓紧田间生产
    本报太原21日电　山西省旱象日趋严重，抗旱斗争已全面展开。
    入夏以来，全省各种农作物生长良好，有丰收希望。但自7月下旬起，地温增高，雨量稀少，至目前为止，全省除少数地区最近落雨外，绝大部分地区普遍干旱。干旱最严重的一部分县，从6月初到现在降雨量仅达五十公厘；干旱较严重的一部分县，从6月到现在降雨量也不到一百公厘；干旱较轻的一部分县，从7月中旬到现在也很少落雨。
    为了动员人民抗旱保苗，省人民委员会于8月12日发出了关于抗旱保苗力争粮棉丰收的紧急指示，号召各级领导干部和农业社员们，立即行动起来与干旱现象作坚决的斗争。最近中共山西省委又召开了全省电话会议。省委第一书记陶鲁笳指示全省要把抗旱备荒当作当前农村工作中最中心最迫切的任务。要求省、专、县三级机关立即派大批干部深入农村领导抗旱备荒工作。对一切可以缓开的会议，暂时不开，一切可以缓办的事，暂时不办，以便集中全力向旱灾进行最顽强的斗争。陶鲁笳同志并指示各地要充分利用现有的一切水利设备，发挥一切可能发挥的水利资源，进行保苗。在一切可能争取丰产的地区，要抓紧时间大力进行加工加肥，补种秋菜，力争丰产，以丰补歉，支援全省。灾区人民要大量采集野菜，以备渡荒。
    电话会议后，以省委第一书记陶鲁笳等为首的省市机关工作人员曾分批到城郊农业社担水浇苗。各县主要领导干部以及大批工作人员，也都积极行动起来，深入农村领导群众，全面展开了抗旱备荒斗争。
    本报讯　湖南省各级党委正在结合粮食征购工作，加强对秋收作物生产的领导，争取全面丰收。湖南省早稻丰收，中稻也丰收在望，晚稻已基本插完，接着应该种植荞麦、泥豆、红薯秋冬作物。由于全省正在开展社会主义宣传运动，开始进行粮食征购工作，有些地方放松秋冬作物生产领导。有的社干部认为早中稻丰收了，不抓紧搞秋冬作物也够吃的；有些农民怕自己多种了杂粮，国家会多购主粮；还有些人认为季节还早，满不在乎。中共湖南省委针对上述情况指示各地在进行粮食工作的同时，必须加强对播种秋冬作物的领导，并向农民说明，凡是杂粮生产较多的农业社，国家可多购一些杂粮，以解除顾虑。
    现在，粮食、农业等有关部门，正在从供应种子和加强技术指导等业务工作中，推动秋冬作物的生产。
