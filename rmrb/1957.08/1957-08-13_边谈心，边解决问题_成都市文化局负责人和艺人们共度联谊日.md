Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, August 12th: The morning of August 9th was the second affiliation day for Chengdu's opera and ballad artists. Leaders from the Municipal Bureau of Culture and many artists gathered to chat and directly resolved some issues raised by the artists regarding performance venues, sickness subsidies, and other matters.

This kind of affiliation day is held weekly. It is one of the new measures taken by the Municipal Bureau of Culture to improve its work by accepting the opinions of ballad artists.

Since the symposium of ballad artists was held in May, the Chengdu Municipal Bureau of Culture has made many improvements to its leadership of ballad work. Now, an organization for exploring and arranging traditional ballad programs has been established. More than 300 yangqin (Chinese dulcimer) and zhuqin (bamboo dulcimer) scripts have been excavated and collected, and more than 170 Qingyin (Sichuan ballad) tunes have been discovered. Among them, many programs such as the yangqin pieces "Bo Ya Shatters the Qin" and "Qin Teasing" have not been performed for a long time and are on the verge of being lost. The Municipal Bureau of Culture has also formulated a plan to train more than 20 young actors this year and has stipulated measures to encourage artists to bring their own apprentices. Several students who have recently been absorbed into Chengdu's ballad theaters to study yangqin and Qingyin are already able to publicly perform one or two programs.

Some ballad artists have suffered from the lack of fixed performance venues. After consultation between the Municipal Bureau of Culture and relevant units, nine additional book sheds have now been added for artists to perform in; more than 30 others will be opened successively. In addition, three ballad theaters are being newly built and renovated, and a newly built theater in the suburban industrial area can accommodate more than 400 listeners. The artists are very satisfied with the Municipal Bureau of Culture's approach of "rectifying while improving."

    边谈心，边解决问题
    成都市文化局负责人和艺人们共度联谊日
    新华社成都12日电　9日上午是成都市戏曲、曲艺艺人的第二个联谊日。市文化局的负责人和许多艺人聚在一起谈心，当场解决了一些艺人提出的关于演唱场地、疾病补助等方面的问题。
    这种联谊日每周举行一次。是市文化局接受曲艺艺人意见改进工作的新措施之一。
    自5月份召开曲艺艺人座谈会后，成都市文化局对领导曲艺工作作了不少改进。现在，发掘整理传统曲艺节目的组织已经成立。已发掘搜集到的扬琴和竹琴唱本就有三百多个，并发现一百七十多支清音曲牌。其中扬琴“伯牙碎琴”“琴挑”等许多节目都是久未演唱、行将失传的。市文化局还订出了在今年培养二十多个青年演员的计划，并规定了鼓励艺人自带徒弟的办法。成都市曲艺书场新吸收的学习扬琴、清音的几个学生已经能公开演唱一两个节目了。
    一些曲艺艺人曾苦于没有固定演唱场地。经过市文化局和有关单位协商，现在已增加了九处供艺人演唱的书棚；将陆续开放的还有三十多处。此外，正在新建和改建三座曲艺书场，在市郊工业区新建成的一处书场就可容纳四百多听众。艺人们对市文化局这种“边整边改”的作法很满意。
