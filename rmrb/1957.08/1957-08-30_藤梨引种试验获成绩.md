Achievements in the Introduction Experiment of Kiwifruit

Kiwifruit has the advantages of rapid growth, early fruiting, high yield, and long lifespan. In addition to being eaten fresh, the fruit can also be made into dried fruit, jam, candied fruit, etc. According to chemical analysis, the Vitamin C content in dog kiwifruit is fifteen to twenty times higher than that of lemons. Among them, the fruit of the hairy kiwifruit is the largest, sweet and delicious, and has a fragrant aroma. The famous "Qingcheng Wine" is made from it. The tender branches of kiwifruit contain gum, which is an important raw material in the waxed paper industry; its flowers contain aromatic oils, which can be used in the food industry. Kiwifruit is also a graceful and beautiful ornamental garden plant.

Since 1954, the Nanjing Botanical Garden of the Institute of Botany of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the leadership of Professor Zeng Mian, began the domestication and cultivation experiment of wild kiwifruit. They successively investigated and collected seven species, including hairy kiwifruit, white hairy kiwifruit, soft jujube kiwifruit, and Ge jujube kiwifruit in Tianmu Mountain, Lushan Mountain, Huangshan Mountain, and Huangyan, etc. In 1955, on the basis of extensive collection, they began a series of studies focusing on hairy kiwifruit.

Over the past three years, they have conducted sowing experiments, cutting experiments, observation of biological characteristics, and started grafting experiments, cultivation management methods such as pruning, and work on sexual hybridization. Experiments have proved that seedling both in adaptability (especially in drought resistance) and growth are much better than seedlings directly excavated from the mountains. The results of the cutting experiment proved that, except for hairy kiwifruit and white hairy kiwifruit, the other five species are easy to root. Literature reports that kiwifruit seedlings require six to seven years to bear fruit, but the kiwifruit sown in the garden bloomed and fruited in the third year. This year, they began sexual hybridization with the largest-fruited hairy kiwifruit, the best-tasting white hairy kiwifruit, and the high-yielding and highly adaptable black-core kiwifruit. The artificially pollinated fruits are growing. (Nanjing Botanical Garden)

　  藤梨引种试验获成绩
    藤梨具有生长快、结果早、产量高、寿命长的优点，果实除供生食外，还可制成果干、果酱、蜜饯等。据化学分析，狗枣藤梨中丙种维生素的含量比柠檬高十五到二十倍。其中以毛叶藤梨的果实最大，甜香可口，异香扑鼻，享有盛名的
  “青城酒”，就是用它酿成的。藤梨的嫩枝的浸胶是腊纸工业上的重要原料；它的花中含有芳香油，可供食品工业之用。藤梨还是一种婀娜多姿的庭园观赏植物。
    从1954年起，中国科学院植物研究所南京中山植物园在曾勉教授的领导下，开始了野生藤梨的驯化栽培试验，先后在天目山、庐山、黄山、黄岩等地调查收集了毛叶藤梨、白毛藤梨、软枣藤梨、葛枣藤梨等七种。1955年在广泛收集的基础上，他们开始以毛叶藤梨为重点进行了一系列的研究。
    三年来他们进行了播种试验、扦插试验、生物学特性观察，并开始了嫁接试验、整枝修剪等栽培管理方法和有性杂交等方面的工作。试验证明，实生苗无论在适应性上（特别是在抗旱性上）、生长力上都比直接由山区挖掘的苗木好得多。扦插试验的结果证明，除毛叶藤梨和白毛藤梨外，其他五种生根都很容易。文献报道藤梨实生苗结实需要六年到七年，而该园播种的藤梨第三年就开花结果。他们今年开始以果实最大的毛叶藤梨和味道最好的白毛藤梨以及丰产而适应性较强的黑蕊藤梨进行有性杂交，人工授粉的果实正在成长中。（南京中山植物园）
