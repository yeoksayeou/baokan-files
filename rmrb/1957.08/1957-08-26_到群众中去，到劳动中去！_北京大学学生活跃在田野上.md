　　Go to the Masses, Go to Labor!
　　Peking University Students Active in the Fields

　　(Our Dispatch) Under the resounding slogan of "Go to the masses, go to labor, transform yourselves into intellectuals of the working class," Peking University students have taken action. Most of the students who returned home went to the countryside to participate in agricultural labor, and to the cities to participate in manual labor. As for the students who remained at school, from the third day of the vacation, 18 students formed an earthwork team and participated in carrying earth on the campus construction site; more than 600 students participated in voluntary labor to beautify the campus; and more than 200 students asked the Municipal Labor Bureau to introduce them to construction sites to work as laborers. Since mid-August, under the organization and arrangement of the student union, more than a thousand students from the entire school have gone to agricultural production cooperatives such as Si Ji Qing, Lian Hua, and Yong Qing in the suburbs of Beijing to help the cooperatives carry manure, weed, harvest vegetables, and pick winter melons. Everyone's enthusiasm for labor is very high and they are very popular with the masses. When the people who went to the Si Ji Qing Agricultural Cooperative were carrying baskets of winter melons shirtless, an old lady from the Seventh Production Team said with emotion: "Capable in both literary and military affairs, truly good students!" The students said: Our labor is to support the agricultural cooperative, and it is also for ourselves.

　　During the labor, the cadres and members of each agricultural cooperative warmly introduced the labor organization, the superiority of cooperation, and the improvement of living conditions to the students. They received a vivid socialist ideological education.

　　In recent days, the atmosphere of labor on the campus of Peking University has been particularly strong. As soon as it dawns in the morning, everyone prepares straw hats, water bottles, and labor tools, and goes to the countryside at seven o'clock. After the sun sets, the people who worked in the fields return, and the people who worked on campus put down their carrying baskets and shoulder poles. Joyful songs after labor resound on campus.

　  到群众中去，到劳动中去！
　　北京大学学生活跃在田野上
    本报讯　“到群众中去，到劳动中去，改造自己成为工人阶级的知识分子”。北京大学学生在这个响亮的口号下，行动起来了。回家的学生，大部分到农村去参加农业劳动，到城市去参加体力劳动。而留校的学生，从假期生活开始的第三天，即有十八人组成土方小组，参加校内工地挑土劳动；有六百多人参加美化校园的义务劳动；有二百多人请市劳动局介绍去工地作杂工。从八月中旬以来，在学生会的组织安排下，全校又有千余学生到北京市郊区四季青、联华、永青等农业生产合作社，帮助社里担粪、锄草、收菜、摘冬瓜。大家的劳动热情非常高涨，深受群众欢迎。到四季青农业社劳动的人，当他们光着膀子抬着一筐筐的冬瓜的时候，第七生产队的一位老大娘感动地说：“能文能武，真是好学生”！同学们说：我们的劳动是支援农业社，也是为了我们自己。
    在劳动中，各农业社干部和社员，都热情地向同学们介绍社里的劳动组织，合作化的优越性和生活改善的情况。他们受到了一次生动的社会主义思想教育。
    近些日子来，北京大学校园里的劳动气氛格外浓厚。早晨天一亮，大家就准备好草帽、水壶和劳动工具，七点钟就下乡去。太阳落山以后，到田间劳动的人归来了，在校内劳动的人也放下了抬筐扁担。校园内响起劳动后的愉快的歌声。
