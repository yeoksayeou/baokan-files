Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 4th. Junior and senior primary school graduates of the Happiness Road Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dazhu Township, Beizhen County, Liaoning Province, have made rapid progress after participating in agricultural production. A total of 110 junior and senior primary school graduates have participated in agricultural production in this cooperative over the past few years. Under the care and cultivation of the cooperative, they have raised their political awareness, generally settled down to agricultural production, and mastered agricultural production knowledge and skills, which have been praised by the masses.

These graduates have generally become the backbone force of the cooperative, becoming a new generation of knowledgeable farmers. To date, one of these graduates has served as the cooperative director, three have participated in the cooperative's management committee, two have participated in the cooperative's public security committee, and one has participated in the supervisory committee. In addition, there are junior and senior primary school graduates in all positions of the cooperative. Some are production team leaders, some are technicians, statisticians, health workers, nursery workers, or civil school teachers.

These junior and senior primary school graduates have worked very hard since joining the agricultural production cooperative. The cooperative not only welcomed them but also assigned them tasks within their capabilities according to the needs of the cooperative and considering the different characteristics of the graduates' physical conditions and ages. The cooperative also frequently pays attention to conducting political and ideological education for the graduates and summarizing their achievements in production to encourage their enthusiasm for labor and enable them to play a vanguard role in production. During the drought this year, the graduates took the lead and basically completed the cooperative's sowing task.

Because these graduates have made rapid progress, two have joined the Chinese Communist Party, forty-eight have joined the Communist Youth League, two have participated in the county's model worker conference, and fourteen have become outstanding cooperative members and received awards.

In order to improve the knowledge and technical level of the graduates who go to the countryside to participate in agricultural production, the Happiness Road Agricultural Cooperative also organized agricultural technology studies, mobilized veteran farmers to provide them with practical guidance, and invited technicians from the tractor station to give lectures on agricultural technology to the graduates. In addition, the agricultural cooperative also attaches great importance to arranging recreational activities for the graduates.

    新一代有知识的农民在成长
    参加幸福之途农业社的毕业生受到群众称赞
    新华社沈阳4日电　辽宁省北镇县大祖乡幸福之途农业生产合作社的初中、高小毕业生在参加农业生产后，进步很快。这个社几年来参加农业生产的初中、高小毕业生共有一百一十名，他们在合作社的关怀培养下，提高了政治觉悟，较普遍地安心农业生产，并且掌握了农业生产知识和技能，受到群众的称赞。
    这些毕业生已普遍变成合作社的骨干力量，成为新一代有知识的农民。截至目前，这些毕业生已有一人作了社主任，三人参加了社的管理委员会，两人参加了社的治安委员会，一人参加了监察委员会。此外，社的各个岗位上，都有初中、高小毕业学生。其中有的是生产队长，有的是技术员、统计员、保健员、保育员或民校教师。
    这些初中、高小毕业生自从参加了农业生产合作社以后，就非常努力。社里对他们不但表示欢迎，而且按合作社的需要，以及考虑到毕业生的身体情况和年龄大小等不同特点，分配给他们力所能及的活计。合作社还经常注意对毕业生进行政治思想教育和总结他们在生产中的成绩，以鼓励他们的劳动积极性，使他们在生产中起先锋作用。今年抗旱时，毕业生们个个带头，基本上完成了全社的播种任务。
    这些毕业生由于进步很快，目前已有两人参加了中国共产党，四十八人参加了共青团，另外有两人参加过县的劳动模范会议，十四人成为社里的优秀社员受到了奖励。
    幸福之途农业社为了提高下乡参加农业生产的毕业生的知识技术水平，还组织了农业技术学习，动员老农对他们进行实际指导和请拖拉机站技术员给毕业生讲农业技术课。此外，农业社还很重视安排毕业生的文娱活动。
