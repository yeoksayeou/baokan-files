    A Clumsy Trick by the U.S. State Department

    The U.S. State Department issued a press release on August 22, announcing that twenty-four American journalists would be allowed to come to China for interviews. On the surface, this seems to be a change in the U.S. State Department's ban on American journalists coming to China. In reality, this is a clumsy trick.

    Since August 1956, the Chinese government has successively approved applications from many American journalists requesting to come to China for interviews. However, the U.S. State Department has prohibited American journalists from coming to China, attempting to block news about the new China from the American people. This blatant practice has aroused great dissatisfaction among the American people and has been strongly condemned by American public opinion. In order to escape the significant pressure it is facing at home and abroad, the U.S. State Department is now, on the one hand, announcing that it will allow a certain number of American journalists to come to China for interviews, and on the other hand, unreasonably refusing to grant reciprocal visas to Chinese journalists. From this, it can be seen that the U.S. State Department has not changed its consistent policy of hostility towards the new China. It has set up obstacles to prevent the people of China and the United States from interacting with each other and is attempting to shift the responsibility to the Chinese government. However, according to the principle of equality and reciprocity, allowing journalists from both sides to reside in each other's countries to report news, in order to enhance mutual understanding between the people of all countries, is a well-known international practice. Testing this with this international practice makes it easy to expose the U.S. State Department's trick. The U.S. State Department cannot escape the responsibility of obstructing interactions between the people of China and the United States, no matter what.

    The U.S. State Department's attempt to unilaterally send American journalists to China has ulterior motives. The U.S. State Department's press release stated that due to the "emergence of some new factors, it is appropriate for the American people to obtain further information about the domestic situation in China." U.S. State Department spokesman White also implied in answering reporters' questions that the U.S. government is very interested in the anti-Party and anti-socialist activities of right-wing elements in China. It turns out that the U.S. State Department has illusions about the situation in our country, thinking there is an opportunity to exploit, and attempting to drive American journalists to serve as tools for collecting intelligence and conducting activities for it. In fact, this is not surprising. The U.S. government has never stopped its sabotage activities against our country. The United States has occupied our territory of Taiwan, militarily threatening our country's security, while also using bases like Hong Kong to continuously carry out subversive activities against our country. Now, the U.S. government is attempting to send people into our country to find opportunities for conspiratorial activities. However, the increasingly united Chinese people have full confidence and determination to safeguard their socialist cause. These sabotage activities by the U.S. government are not only futile but also cannot be tolerated by the Chinese people.

    It is common sense that a journalist from one country going to another country for interviews must abide by the latter's laws and regulations. However, the U.S. State Department completely disregards this point and attempts to predetermine the tasks for American journalists coming to China for interviews. The U.S. State Department's press release stated that "one of the hopes" for sending American journalists to China is that they can report on the situation of American prisoners currently serving sentences in China. It should be pointed out that regarding the situation of American prisoners, Chinese representatives have repeatedly notified American representatives during the Sino-American ambassadorial talks in Geneva. Moreover, every time an American prisoner is released and returned home, the Chinese side has reported on it. Therefore, the U.S. State Department should already fully understand the current situation of American prisoners. The U.S. State Department hypocritically expressed "concern" for American prisoners in the press release. However, despite the Chinese government's repeated expressions that it could allow family members to come to China to visit American prisoners, the U.S. State Department has consistently obstructed this. The U.S. State Department has consistently used the issue of American prisoners to stir up emotions between the people of China and the United States, increasing the gap between them. Now, the U.S. State Department has once again predetermined the task of reporting on the situation of American prisoners for American journalists coming to China for interviews. Its purpose is clearly unrelated to enhancing mutual understanding between the people of China and the United States.

    The U.S. State Department's press release very typically demonstrates the attitude of an imperialist government that does not speak of equality and reciprocity, interferes in the internal affairs of others, and attempts to impose its will on others. The United States, accustomed to acting despotically in the imperialist world, believes that it can unilaterally decide to send American journalists to China, while at the same time refusing to grant reciprocal visas to Chinese journalists without feeling any impropriety. However, the days when the Chinese people were arbitrarily manipulated by others are long gone. The imperialist arrogance of the United States can have no effect on the Chinese people other than arousing the anger of the Chinese people.

    The Chinese government has consistently strived to create conditions to increase interactions and understanding between the people of China and the United States. The Chinese government has proposed suggestions to expand trade and promote cultural exchanges between the two countries during the Sino-American ambassadorial talks in Geneva. However, the American representatives even refused to discuss these suggestions. In order to take the first step in easing tensions and promoting interactions between the people of China and the United States, the Chinese government took the initiative to approve the applications of many American journalists to come to China for interviews and expected that Chinese journalists would also receive reciprocal treatment to go to the United States for interviews. However, the U.S. State Department's press release showed that the U.S. government held completely opposite purposes. The U.S. government completely disregards the principle of equality and reciprocity, attempting to use American journalists to collect intelligence, carry out sabotage activities, and stir up emotions between the people of China and the United States in China.

    The Chinese government will continue to work to enhance the contact and mutual understanding between the people of China and the United States in accordance with its consistent policy. The unilateral decision announced by the U.S. State Department in the press release is absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese people.

### 美国国务院的一个拙劣的骗局

    美国国务院的一个拙劣的骗局
    美国国务院在8月22日发表新闻公报宣布，二十四名美国记者将获准来中国进行采访。从表面上看，这似乎是改变了美国国务院不许美国记者来华的禁令，其实，这是一个拙劣的骗局。
    自从1956年8月，中国政府就曾经陆续批准了许多美国记者要求来中国采访的申请。但是，美国国务院却禁止美国记者到中国来，力图对美国人民封锁关于新中国的报道。这种露骨的作法，引起了美国人民的极大不满，遭到了美国公众舆论的强烈谴责。为了摆脱在国内外所受到的重大压力，美国国务院现在一方面宣布准许一定人数的美国记者来中国采访，另一方面却毫无道理地拒绝给中国记者互惠的签证。从这里可以看出，美国国务院丝毫没有改变它一贯敌视新中国的政策，它设下了使中美两国人民不能互相来往的障碍，并且企图把责任推到中国政府的身上。但是，根据平等互惠的原则，容许双方记者驻在对方国家报道新闻，以增进各国人民的互相了解，这是尽人皆知的国际惯例。拿这个国际惯例来考验，就可以很容易地戳穿美国国务院的骗局。美国国务院无论如何也不能逃避阻挠中美两国人民互相来往的责任。
    美国国务院企图片面派遣美国记者到中国来，是有它不可告人的目的的。美国国务院的新闻公报说，由于“出现了一些新的因素，因而宜于使美国人民得到关于中国国内现状的进一步情报”。美国国务院发言人怀特在答复记者的问题的时候又暗示，美国政府对于中国国内右派分子的反党反社会主义的活动感到很大的兴趣。原来美国国务院对我国国内的形势存在着幻想，以为有机可乘，企图驱使美国新闻记者作为替它搜集情报、进行活动的工具。其实，这是不足为怪的。美国政府从来就没有停止对我国的破坏活动。美国侵占了我国领土台湾，在军事上威胁我国的安全，同时还利用像香港这样的基地不断地对我国进行颠覆活动。现在，美国政府又企图派人到我国内部来寻找阴谋活动的机会。但是，团结得日益坚强的中国人民，对于维护自己的社会主义事业是具有充分的信心和决心的。美国政府的这些破坏活动，不仅是徒然的，而且也是中国人民所决不能容许的。
    一国的记者到另外一国去采访，必须遵守后者的法律和规则，这本来是非常普通的常识。但是，美国国务院却完全不考虑这一点，企图为来华采访的美国记者事先规定好任务。美国国务院的新闻公报表示，派遣美国记者到中国来的“希望之一”是他们能报道目前还在中国服刑的美国犯人的情况。应该指出，关于美国犯人的情况，中国代表曾经在日内瓦的中美大使级会谈中多次通知过美国代表。而且，每一次美犯获释回国，中国方面都作了报道。因此，美国国务院应该已经充分了解美国犯人的现况。美国国务院在新闻公报中伪善地对美国犯人表示“关怀”。但是，尽管中国政府多次表示可以准许家属来中国探望美国犯人，美国国务院却始终加以阻挠。美国国务院一直利用美国犯人的问题挑拨中美两国人民的感情，增加彼此之间的隔阂。现在，美国国务院又事先为来华采访的美国记者规定了报道美国犯人情况的任务，其目的显然是同增进中美两国人民的相互了解毫不相干的。
    美国国务院的新闻公报十分典型地表现了帝国主义政府不讲平等互惠、干涉别人内政、企图强加于人的态度。在帝国主义世界横行霸道惯了的美国，以为凭它的片面决定就可以派遣美国记者到中国来，而同时可以毫不感到失礼地拒绝给中国记者互惠的签证。但是，中国人民受别人随意摆布的日子早已一去不复返了。美国的帝国主义臭架子，除了激起中国人民的愤怒以外，不能对中国人民起任何作用。
    中国政府一贯为了增加中美两国人民之间的互相来往和了解而努力创造条件。中国政府曾经在日内瓦的中美大使级会谈中提出开展两国贸易和促进两国文化交流的建议。但是，美国代表甚至拒绝对这些建议进行讨论。为了在和缓紧张局势和促进中美两国人民来往的方面迈出第一步，中国政府主动地批准许多美国记者来华采访，并且期待中国记者也得到互惠的待遇去美国采访。但是，美国国务院的新闻公报却表现出美国政府抱着完全相反的目的。美国政府根本不考虑平等互惠的原则，企图通过美国记者在中国搜集情报，进行破坏活动，挑拨中美两国人民的感情。
    中国政府将继续按照一贯的政策努力增进中美两国人民的接触和相互了解。美国国务院在新闻公报中所宣布的片面决定是中国人民绝对不能接受的。
