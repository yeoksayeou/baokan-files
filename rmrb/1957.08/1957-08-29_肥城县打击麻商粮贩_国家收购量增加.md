Feicheng County Cracks Down on Hemp Merchants and Grain Speculators
　National Procurement Volume Increases

　　This newspaper reports that after Feicheng County, Shandong Province, resolutely cracked down on the illegal activities of hemp merchants and grain speculators, the unified purchase of grain and hemp has gradually returned to normal.

　　Feicheng is a key hemp-producing area in Shandong. In the past, due to speculative activities by merchants, the state was unable to complete its procurement tasks. In early July of this year, the county established a Market Management Committee headed by the county magistrate and established eight market transaction management offices to specifically take charge of banning illegal transactions. Each market transaction management office launched extensive propaganda and education work in the market and organized the masses to investigate and seize smuggling activities. In recent months, a total of 290 cases of private transportation of hemp and grain have been seized, totaling more than 3,600 jin of hemp and 3,900 jin of grain. Recently, based on reports from the masses, relevant departments arrested three old speculators, Wang Chuanhai, Wang Lebing, and others, according to the law. Since August 10, the county's daily hemp procurement volume has reached 200,000 jin. After the abolition of the free grain market and the implementation of socialist education for farmers, the wheat procurement volume has approached 8 million jin, and the prices of other grains have also tended to stabilize.

　　It has also been discovered that some merchants from other places are disrupting the market through local connections, and relevant departments will further crack down on this.

　　肥城县打击麻商粮贩
　  国家收购量增加
    本报讯　山东肥城县坚决打击麻商、粮贩的违法活动后，粮麻的统购工作已日趋正常。
    肥城是山东产麻的重点地区，过去由于商贩投机活动，使国家不能完成收购任务。今年7月初，该县成立了以县长为首的市场管理委员会，并建立了八处市场交易管理所，具体负责取缔违法交易。各个市场交易管理所在集市上展开了广泛的宣传教育工作，并组织群众查缉偷运活动。近月来，共查获私运大麻、粮食的有二百九十起，计大麻三千六百多斤，粮食三千九百斤。最近，有关部门根据群众的告发，依法逮捕了王传海、王乐炳等三个老投机商。8月10日以来，全县大麻收购量，每天已达到二十万斤；小麦收购在取缔粮食自由市场和对农民进行社会主义教育以后，收购量已近八百万斤，其他粮食价格也趋稳定。
    目前还发现有些外地商贩通过当地关系人破坏市场，有关部门将进一步取缔。
