    Can Musk Deer Be Domesticated?
    Can They Secrete Musk After Domestication?
    To explore this secret, the Sichuan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative's Chinese Medicinal Materials Management Department decided to establish China's first musk deer farm in the deep mountains of Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan Province, which is rich in musk, to conduct systematic observation and research on the life and habits of musk deer, and to conduct domestication and breeding experiments.
    Musk is a secretion congealed in the navel of male musk deer and is a valuable medicinal material and fragrance. Historically, musk has been collected in all producing areas by indiscriminately capturing and killing musk deer, regardless of gender or age, causing great losses. Sichuan Province produces about 30,000 taels of musk annually, and nearly 200,000 musk deer are killed each year. This decision to build a musk deer farm is an attempt to fundamentally change the "killing the goose that lays the golden eggs" approach. If this experiment is successful, it will not only be possible to turn musk deer into domestic animals in the future, but also to adopt scientific methods of extracting musk from live musk deer, to achieve planned production of musk and further meet the needs of domestic and foreign markets.

### 麝能否驯化？驯化后能否分泌麝香？

    麝能否驯化？
    驯化后能否分泌麝香？
    为了探索这个秘密，四川省供销合作社中药材经营管理处决定在盛产麝香的阿坝藏族自治州理县的深山中建立我国第一座养麝场，对麝的生活、习性等从事系统的观察和研究，并作驯化养殖试验。
    麝香是凝结在雄麝肚脐里的分泌物，是一种贵重的药材和香料。历来各产区在采集麝香时都是不论雌雄老幼，一律捕杀，造成很大损失。四川省年产麝香约三万两，每年捕杀的雌雄麝近二十万头。这次决定建场驯麝，就是试图从根本上改变那种“杀鸡取卵”的办法。如果这一试验成功，将来不仅可以把麝变成家畜，而且还可采用从活麝身上取香的科学方法，作到有计划地生产麝香，进一步满足国内外市场的需要。
