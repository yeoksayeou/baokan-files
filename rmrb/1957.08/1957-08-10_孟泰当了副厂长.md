Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Meng Tai, a nationally renowned labor model and veteran worker at the Anshan Iron and Steel Works' Iron Smelting Plant, has recently been appointed as the deputy director of the plant by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry.

Meng Tai is a banner among the workers of Anshan Iron and Steel. He has been repeatedly recognized as a labor model in Anshan City and throughout the country. When Anshan Iron and Steel was being restored from the ruins left by enemy destruction, Meng Tai took the lead in initiating a campaign to donate equipment and actively worked to repair the blast furnaces, quickly enabling them to produce molten iron. In 1952, when American planes intruded into our country's airspace and circled over Anshan, Meng Tai carried a small bedding roll and guarded the blast furnaces day and night. When accidents occurred at the blast furnaces, he always stood at the front, leading his comrades, unafraid of the sparks burning his skin or the cold water soaking his body, determined to repair the blast furnaces.

Meng Tai loves the plant more than his own home. He collected scattered steel materials discarded by the roadside and established the famous "Meng Tai Warehouse," ensuring the supply of equipment needed for blast furnace maintenance.

Meng Tai treats the workers he works with as if they were his own brothers.

    孟泰当了副厂长
    据新华社讯　闻名全国的劳动模范、鞍钢炼铁厂老工人孟泰最近被冶金工业部任命为这个厂的副厂长。
    孟泰是鞍钢工人中的旗帜，曾几次被评为鞍山市和全国的劳动模范。当鞍钢在被敌人破坏的废墟上恢复起来的时候，孟泰带头发起了献器材运动，并且积极抢修高炉，使高炉很快流出了铁水。1952年美国的飞机侵入我国境盘旋在鞍山上空的时候，孟泰就挟着一个小铺盖卷，日日夜夜守卫在高炉旁。当高炉发生事故的时候，他总是站在前面，带着他的伙伴，不怕火花灼伤了他的皮肤，不怕冷水浸湿了他的全身，坚决把高炉抢修好。
    孟泰爱厂胜爱家。他把丢弃在路旁的一些零星钢铁材料搜集起来，创立了有名的“孟泰仓库”，保证了检修高炉所需要的器材。
    孟泰对同他一起工作的工人亲如手足。
