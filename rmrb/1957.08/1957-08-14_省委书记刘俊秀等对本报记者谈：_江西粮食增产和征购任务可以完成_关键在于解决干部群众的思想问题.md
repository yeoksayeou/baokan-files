Our newspaper, Lushan, August 13th (Reporter Li Lianbin) reported: Since July 26th, Jiangxi has experienced widespread welcome rains. Except for a few counties, the drought that had plagued the region since the beginning of summer has been completely or largely eliminated. Currently, the province's 18.2 million mu of early rice has been mostly harvested, and nearly 7.6 million mu of intermediate rice is also about to be harvested. The vast number of farmers are concentrating all their efforts on harvesting early and intermediate rice, and rushing to plant late rice and other autumn crops, striving to complete and exceed the 1957 agricultural production plan. At the same time, leading organs at all levels, the vast majority of cadres, and the broad masses of farmers are actively carrying out various preparations for the unified purchase and sale of grain. Many places have already prepaid public grain and presold surplus grain to the state.

This year, Jiangxi Province experienced a relatively severe drought. Since the beginning of summer, a considerable number of farmers, especially wealthy farmers, due to the influence of individualism and departmentalism, have universally exaggerated the disaster situation and underestimated yields. They want to keep more grain for themselves and sell less grain to the state. A considerable number of township and commune cadres, because of their one-sided view of the masses, blindly followed the masses in exaggerating the summer disaster situation and underreporting yields. Even some leading cadres above the county level echoed these sentiments.

On August 9th, Liu Junxiu, Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee, and Deputy Governor Deng Hong, Director of the Provincial Party Committee's Rural Work Department Wang Dachuan, Deputy Director of the Agricultural Department Sheng Pu, and other comrades spoke to reporters about the grain production situation in Jiangxi Province this year. They unanimously believed that with the rain that has fallen throughout the province, it is certain that grain production will increase this year, and the grain requisitioning and purchasing tasks for this year can also be completed. Comrade Liu Junxiu said: "Throughout the years, every time it comes to requisitioning and purchasing grain, a considerable number of people and cadres, including some leading cadres above the county level, exaggerate the disaster situation and underestimate yields. This phenomenon has almost become a rule. The purpose is nothing more than to reduce the grain purchase task and keep more food grain. But since the liberation of Jiangxi Province, the actual grain output in the past seven years, whether in good years, average years, or disaster years, has remained stable on the basis of the previous year, achieving production maintenance, slight increases, or bumper harvests." He cited production increase figures from the past seven years to illustrate: From 1950 to 1956, a total of 5.25 billion jin of grain was increased, an increase of 67.8%, with an average annual increase of 750 million jin of grain. With the gradual increase in grain production, the amount of grain retained by the masses has also increased. For example, if the amount of grain retained in 1950 is taken as 100, then it was 130 in 1956. Liu Junxiu said: "The increase in grain production has not only guaranteed the supply of food grain, seeds, and feed for the people of the province, but also guaranteed the state's grain transfer task for Jiangxi Province, strongly supporting the country's socialist construction and ensuring the stability of market prices." He said that Jiangxi Province's outward transfer of rice has increased year by year. From 1950 to 1956, a total of 5.322 billion jin of rice was transferred out.

When talking about the grain production situation this year, Comrade Liu Junxiu and others calculated the possibility of increased production and believed that with the increase in early rice production, plus the yield of intermediate rice and spring-harvested crops such as wheat, there is already confidence that 8.6 billion jin of grain will be in hand. They believe that if there is another one or two relatively abundant rains (50 to 80 millimeters each time) between late August and early September, and if field management work such as replanting seedlings, nurturing seedlings, weeding, applying fertilizer, and cultivating the fields is done well, it will be possible to strive for a bumper harvest of late rice. The total grain output of the province (calculated as paddy rice) can reach about 14 billion jin, an increase of 1 billion jin compared to last year.

Based on the analysis of the possible increase in production, this year's grain requisitioning and purchasing tasks in Jiangxi Province can be completed. Liu Junxiu believes that the bad ideological style of exaggerating the disaster situation and underestimating yields among some of the masses and cadres should not be tolerated or condoned, but should be subjected to in-depth education and appropriate criticism. After persuasion and education to clarify the relationship between right and wrong and the relationship between interests, it is believed that the vast majority of those who have this erroneous thinking will quickly correct themselves. However, those who persist in their errors, whether cadres or the masses, should be subjected to serious struggle. He went on to say: "In order to educate the cadres and educate the masses, the most important method is to hope that Party committees and governments at all levels will send a large number of cadres to go deep into the grassroots, participate in production in person, conduct investigations and research, grasp specific materials, find out the actual output, and use vivid facts to refute those individualistic, departmentalist, and right-leaning thoughts that deliberately exaggerate the disaster situation and underestimate yields. Landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries who deliberately sabotage the unified purchase and sale of grain should be given severe blows and sanctions."

Finally, he affirmed: "To ensure the completion of this year's grain production plan and the unified purchase and sale of grain tasks in Jiangxi Province, the basic key is to extensively and deeply carry out a socialist education movement throughout the province, combining the struggle against the rightists to criticize the individualism, departmentalism, and capitalist ideology in the countryside of certain cadres and masses, so as to raise the political consciousness of the cadres and masses and solve ideological problems. At the same time, we should seize the opportunity to make persistent efforts to vigorously promote autumn production, and on the basis of doing a good job in production, ensure the smooth completion of the unified purchase and sale of grain tasks."

    省委书记刘俊秀等对本报记者谈：
    江西粮食增产和征购任务可以完成
    关键在于解决干部群众的思想问题
    本报庐山13日电　记者李连斌报道：7月26日以来，江西各地普降喜雨。除少数县外，入夏以来的旱象已完全或基本消除。目前，全省一千八百二十万亩早稻的收割工作基本结束，近七百六十万亩中稻也将收割，广大农民正集中全力抢收早稻和中稻，抢种晚稻和其他秋季作物，争取完成和超额完成1957年的农业生产计划。与此同时，各级领导机关和绝大多数干部以及广大农民还在积极进行粮食统购统销的各项准备工作。许多地方已提前向国家预交公粮和预售余粮。
    今年，江西省一度旱象较重。入夏以来，有相当一部分农民，特别是富裕农民，由于个人主义和本位主义思想作祟，普遍夸大灾情，压低产量。他们想多留粮食，少卖粮食给国家。相当一部分乡社干部因为存在片面的群众观点，也盲目地跟着群众夸大夏季灾情，少报产量。甚至某些县级以上的领导干部也随声附和。
    8月9日，中共江西省委书记刘俊秀和副省长邓洪、省委农村工作部长王大川、农业厅副厅长盛朴等同志向记者谈到了江西省今年的粮食生产问题。他们一致认为：全省下了这场雨，今年粮食增产是可以肯定的，今年的征粮购粮任务也可以完成。刘俊秀同志说：“历年来每到征粮购粮的时候，都有相当一部分群众和干部，甚至包括县级以上某些领导干部夸大灾情，压低产量。这种现象几乎成为一种规律。其目的不外乎是想减少些购粮任务，多留点口粮。但江西省解放以来，七年中粮食的实际产量，不论丰年、平年或灾年，都稳定在上一个年度的基础上，达到保产、少有增产或丰产。”他列举了七年来的增产数字说明：从1950年算到1956年，七年中共增产粮食五十二亿五千万斤，增产67.8％，平均每年增产粮食七亿五千万斤。随着粮食生产的逐年增加，群众留粮也有所增加，如以1950年留粮为一百，1956年则为一百三十。刘俊秀说：“粮食增产不仅保证了全省人民的口粮、种子和饲料的供应，而且保证了国家给予江西省的粮食外调任务，有力地支援了国家的社会主义建设，保证了市场物价的稳定。”他说，江西省外调大米逐年增加。从1950年到1956年七年中，共调出大米五十三亿二千二百多万斤。
    在谈到今年粮食生产的情况时，刘俊秀同志等对增产的可能算了一笔账，认为早稻增产加上中稻产量以及大小麦等春收作物，共八十六亿斤粮食到手已有把握。他们认为，如果在8月下旬至9月上旬再下一次到两次（每次五十到八十公厘）较充足的雨，并作好补苗、育苗锄草、追肥、耘田等田间管理工作，就可以争取晚稻丰收。全省粮食（按稻谷计）总产量可以达到一百四十亿斤左右，比去年增产十亿斤。
    根据对增产的可能情况的分析，今年江西省的征粮购粮任务是可以完成的。刘俊秀认为对于一部分群众和干部夸大灾情压低产量的恶劣的思想作风不应该迁就姑息，而应进行深入的教育和适当的批评。经过说服教育明确是非关系和利害关系之后，相信凡有这种错误思想的人，绝大多数就会很快地改正过来。但对于那些坚持错误不改的人，不论干部和群众都应进行严肃的斗争。他接着说：“为了教育干部教育群众，更主要的办法是希望各级党委和政府派大批干部深入基层，实地参加生产，进行调查研究，掌握具体材料，摸清实际产量，用生动的事实批驳那些故意夸大灾情、压低产量的个人主义、本位主义和右倾思想。对故意破坏粮食统购统销的地主、富农和反革命分子，应给以严厉的打击与制裁。”
    最后他肯定地说：“江西省要保证完成今年粮食增产计划和粮食统购统销任务，基本关键是必须在全省范围内广泛地深入地开展一个社会主义教育运动，结合反右派斗争批判某些干部和群众的个人主义本位主义和农村中的资本主义思想，以提高干部和群众的政治觉悟，解决思想问题。同时应抓紧时机再接再厉大力搞好秋季生产，并在搞好生产的基础上，来保证粮食统购统销任务的顺利完成。”
