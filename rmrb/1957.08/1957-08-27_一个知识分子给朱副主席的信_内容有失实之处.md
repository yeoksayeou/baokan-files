　　"A Letter from an Intellectual to Vice Chairman Zhu" Contains Factual Errors
　　Editor's Note: On June 28th, this newspaper published a letter to Vice Chairman Zhu from Xiong Zhibin of the Chongqing People's Publishing House, titled "An Intellectual Writes to Vice Chairman Zhu, Reporting on the Situation in Linlang Village, Ma'an Township, Yilong County, Northern Sichuan." Recently, we received a letter from Comrade Chen Guangyuan, Secretary of the General Branch of the Communist Party of China in Ma'an Township, and other comrades, pointing out that Xiong Zhibin's writing contains factual errors. We now publish a summary of the letter.
　　Judging from the letter from the Secretary of the General Branch of the Communist Party of China in Ma'an Township, since liberation, production in the mountainous areas of Yilong has greatly developed, and the lives of the people have greatly improved; however, compared with the plains and areas with convenient transportation, the lives of the people here still have many difficulties. Similar situations exist in most mountainous areas across the country. The main reasons for these difficulties are: first, the principle of comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and local specialties has not been fully implemented in some mountainous areas; second, transportation in mountainous areas is inconvenient, and grassroots commercial networks have not been universally organized, so goods cannot be transported out. In addition, some mountainous areas have been damaged by long-term wars and have experienced more natural disasters, so the economic development of these mountainous areas has been relatively slow. It should be recognized that the economic development of mountainous areas has its superior conditions, abundant resources, and great production potential. It is hoped that all localities will pay attention to strengthening leadership in mountainous areas, explore the rich resources of mountainous areas in many ways, study and solve various problems in the economic development of mountainous areas, and gradually improve the lives of the people in mountainous areas. People's Daily Editorial Department:
　　Your newspaper's article on the fourth page of the June 28th issue, "An Intellectual Writes to Vice Chairman Zhu De, Reporting on the Situation in Linlang Village, Ma'an Township, Yilong County, Northern Sichuan," is highly valued by our county. The Yilong County Committee of the Communist Party of China has conducted a serious study of this situation report, and the criticisms contained therein have been used as a reference for improving our work.
　　However, many of the facts in this report are untrue, and even contain major errors.
　　1. The report states: "Taking Linlang Cooperative as a representative, in 1956, each person in this cooperative had an annual income of only forty yuan, and all expenses for food, clothing, use, and housing were covered by these forty yuan." The actual situation is: the thirty-four households participating in the 1956 distribution in this cooperative already had forty yuan from agricultural income alone. Adding the income from sideline occupations (including collective sideline occupations of the cooperative and sideline occupations of cooperative members' families), the average income per person was twelve yuan and forty jiao, and the average income per person from cooperative members' private plots was about two yuan, for a total of more than fifty-four yuan.
　　"They can only eat three meals of sweet potato porridge a day, plus a bowl of dried pickles." This is also not in accordance with the facts. Last year, this cooperative distributed 1,245 jin of unprocessed grain per person (including 410 jin of rice and wheat), equivalent to 645 jin of refined grain, which greatly exceeded the grain retention standard for state purchase and marketing. It is true that every household had surplus grain. With so much grain, cooperative members would not only eat three meals of sweet potato porridge a day. Half of the households ate an average of two meals of dry rice and one meal of porridge a day, and half of the households ate one meal of dry rice and two meals of porridge. As for vegetables, there are many fresh vegetables in the countryside, so how could they only eat "a bowl of dried pickles"?
　　"Eating meat once a month" is also not the truth. In the entire cooperative of fifty-four households, from September of last year to April of this year, seventy-eight fat pigs weighing more than 120 jin were slaughtered, and each household retained at least 15% of the meat. In addition, each person was supplied with one jin of pork per month, so each person had at least two jin of meat per month. How could two jin of meat be eaten in one meal?
　　2. The situation report states: "I also went to the homes of several farmers and saw that the quilts had no cloth covers, only cotton wadding." After the cooperative saw the report, it immediately conducted an inspection and found that this was not the case. It is said that Comrade Xiong Zhibin went to the home of Zhu Shilun in Linlang Cooperative No. 1. Although there was a hole in the cotton wadding in his home, there was also a quilt cover. Only the cotton wadding of Ding Sanqing, a large landlord who entered and exited through the same door as his family, was very rotten and had no quilt cover.
　　3. In the situation report, there is a major error, which is praising Zhu Daiwen. What kind of person is Zhu Daiwen after all? He is a member of the Kuomintang, a well-known henchman of the Luo Baozheng, and a social scum riding on the heads of the people. At the same time, he is the patriarch of the feudal clan system, and has been in power for more than twenty years. In Ma'an Market, he is a famous "rotten virtuous" sweeper (that is, having improper relationships with daughters-in-law and nieces). The farmers of the Zhu family hate him. Although he was incorporated into the cooperative to participate in production in the winter of 1956, he is not a member of the cooperative. Comrade Xiong Zhibin said that he is "a role model for the cooperative, the most valuable wealth," which is obviously very wrong.
　　Finally, we solemnly state that we do not deny that there are still problems in the countryside. There is still a contradiction in the countryside between backward production and the people's demands for improved living standards. However, the lives of the peasants are not as poor as Comrade Xiong Zhibin said, and the problems in this township are not as serious as he said.

### “一个知识分子给朱副主席的信”内容有失实之处

　　“一个知识分子给朱副主席的信”内容有失实之处
    编者按　本报在6月28日以“一个知识分子写信给朱副主席，报告川北仪陇县马鞍乡琳琅村的情况”为题，发表了重庆人民出版社熊志彬写给朱副主席的信。最近接到中共马鞍乡总支书记陈光远等同志的来信，指出熊志彬所写的内容有失实之处。现将来信摘要发表。
  从中共马鞍乡总支书记的来信看来，解放后，仪陇山区的生产有了很大的发展，人民的生活也有了很大的改善；但若与平原地区和交通便利地区比较，这里的人民生活还存在着不少困难。在全国各地的大多数山区，也有类似的情况。造成这种困难的主要原因，一是有些山区对农、林、牧、土特产等多种经济全面发展的方针贯彻执行的不够；一是山区交通不便，基层商业网也没有普遍组织起来，有东西运不出来。此外，有些山区长期受战争的破坏以及自然灾害较多，所以这些山区的经济发展是比较缓慢的。应当看到，山区经济的发展，有它优越的条件，资源是丰富的，生产潜力是巨大的。希望各地注意加强对山区的领导，多方面发掘山区的丰富资源，研究和解决山区经济发展的各种问题，逐步地改善山区人民的生活。人民日报编辑部：
    你报6月28日第四版刊用的“一个知识分子写信给朱德副主席，报告川北仪陇县马鞍乡琳琅村的情况”的文章，我们县里十分重视。中共仪陇县委对这个情况报告作了认真的研究，其中的批评意见已作为改进工作的参考。
    但是，这个报告里有许多事实是不真实的，甚至有很大的错误。
    一、报告里说：“以琳琅社为代表，这个社1956年每人全年收入不过四十元，吃、穿、用、住都在这四十元内开支。”实际情况是：这个社参加1956年分配的三十四户，仅农业收入这一项就已有四十元，加上副业收入（包括社的集体副业和社员家庭副业）每人平均十二元四角和社员自留地收入每人平均收入两元左右，一共是五十四元多。
    “每天只能吃三顿红苕稀饭，外加一碗干咸菜。”这也不符合事实。这个社去年每人分得原粮一千二百四十五斤（其中稻谷和麦子四百一十斤），折合细粮六百四十五斤，大大超过了统购统销的留粮标准，确实是家家有余粮。有这样多粮食，社员每天是不会只吃三顿红苕稀饭的。有一半的户每天平均吃两顿干饭和一顿稀饭，一半的户是吃一顿干饭和两顿稀饭。至于吃菜，农村新鲜菜蔬多，哪里光吃“一碗干咸菜”呢？
    “一个月吃一回肉”，这也不是真相。全社五十四户，从去年9月到今年4月，就杀了七十八条一百二十斤以上的肥猪，每户最少要留肉15％。此外每月每人还供应猪肉一斤，每人每月最少都有两斤肉。两斤肉一顿怎能吃得完呢？
    二、情况报告中说：“我还到好几户农民家里去看过，被盖没布，光棉絮巾巾”。社里见报后，立即进行检查，是没有这个情况的。据说，熊志彬同志到过琳琅一社的朱世禄家，他家的棉絮虽有一个洞，但又有被盖布，只是与他家同一道门进出的大地主丁三清家的棉絮才很烂，才没有被盖布。
    三、在情况报告中，有一个很大的错误，就是表扬了朱代文。朱代文到底是个什么样的人呢？他是国民党党员，是有名的罗保正的爪牙，是骑在人民头上的社会渣滓。同时，他是封建宗派系统的族长，一直当了二十多年，在马鞍场说来是有名的“烂贤惠”扫皮（即乱和子媳、侄媳发生男女关系），朱家的农民都痛恨他。他虽于1956年冬天被编入社内参加生产，却不是社员。熊志彬同志说他是“社里的榜样，最珍贵的财富”，这显然是很错误的。
    最后，我们郑重说明，我们并不否认农村还有问题。农村仍然存在着生产落后于人民生活改善的要求的矛盾。但是农民的生活并不是熊志彬同志所说的那样穷，本乡存在的问题也不是他所说的那么严重。
