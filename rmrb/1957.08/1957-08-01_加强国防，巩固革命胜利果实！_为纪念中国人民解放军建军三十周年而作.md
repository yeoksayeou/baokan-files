    Strengthen National Defense, Consolidate the Fruits of Revolutionary Victory!
    —Written to Commemorate the 30th Anniversary of the Founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
    粟裕, Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
    August 1st this year marks the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Looking back at the history of our army, from nothing to something, from small to large, from weak to strong, it has gone through a long and tortuous road, smashed countless offensives by powerful enemies at home and abroad, and achieved the victory of the Chinese revolutionary war. Of course, it has also suffered some setbacks and paid a considerable price. However, after thousands of trials and tribulations, our army has been tempered into an invincible force.
    The reason why the Chinese People's Liberation Army is invincible is due to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. The characteristic of the Chinese revolution is armed revolution against armed counter-revolution. In the long revolutionary struggle, the Chinese Communist Party not only pointed out a clear direction of struggle for the Chinese people, but also accumulated rich experience in leading armed struggle, and formulated a correct military line that is completely suitable for the Chinese situation. This military line has been scientifically analyzed and systematically elaborated in Chairman Mao's works. Its main contents are: to defeat superior enemies with inferior equipment, it is necessary to adopt a strategy of protracted war and quick decisions in battles and tactics, to adopt a policy of active defense in the early stage of the war, to consume the enemy in large quantities, to enhance our own strength, and then to move to the counter-offensive after a stalemate; to encircle the cities from the countryside, first seize the vast rural areas and medium and small cities, and then seize the big cities; to take the annihilation of the enemy's living forces as the main goal, not to fight for the gain or loss of one city or one place, to concentrate an absolute superior force on the main attack direction in each battle, and strive to completely annihilate or inflict a destructive blow on the enemy; to closely combine mobile warfare, positional warfare, and guerrilla warfare, and strive to annihilate the enemy in motion, give play to the mobility and flexibility of our army's operations, and adhere to close coordination under unified command. The principles of army building and operational principles formulated by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao not only guided the Chinese revolutionary war to victory in the extremely difficult conditions of the past, but also remain our guiding ideology that we must resolutely follow in the modernization of the army and in the struggle to crush imperialist aggression in the future.
    The reason why the Chinese People's Liberation Army is invincible is due to the support of the broad masses of the people. Our army fights for the interests of the people, comes from the people, serves the people wholeheartedly, has strict discipline, and does not violate the interests of the people in the slightest. Every soldier can consciously abide by the "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention": speak politely, be fair in trade, return borrowed items, compensate for damages, not take a needle or a thread from the masses, and help the masses with production during combat gaps. The broad masses of the people have realized the purpose and aim of our army's operations from their own experience, and regard our army as their own "sons and brothers." The relationship between the army and the people is as close as fish and water. In the years of war, the people saved their own rations to support the front lines, mobilized their sons and daughters and husbands to join the army, and thousands of transport teams and stretcher teams helped our army transport grain and ammunition and rescue the wounded. The militia, organized on a voluntary basis, stood guard, scouted the enemy's situation, captured enemy spies, led the way, delivered letters, and launched surprise attacks and demolition campaigns to attack and harass the enemy, causing the enemy fatigue and fear, and directly cooperated with our army in combat. Thanks to the support of the broad masses of the people, our army has gained many favorable conditions for defeating the enemy.
    The reason why the Chinese People's Liberation Army is invincible is due to the high political consciousness of all commanders and fighters of the army. Every member of our army understands for whom they are fighting, and is not afraid of hardship or sacrifice in combat, forging ahead bravely and unyieldingly. Our army has fought against superior enemies for a long time, with inferior equipment, very little ammunition, insufficient food and clothing, and a severe shortage of medicine. The 25,000-li Long March, crossing snow-capped mountains and grasslands, overcame difficulties rarely seen in the world and created an unprecedented miracle in the history of world military affairs. The few troops left behind after the main force of the Red Army went north tasted all kinds of hardships and smashed the enemy's hundreds of times of encirclement and suppression, and persisted in the three-year guerrilla war in the eight southern provinces. In order to realize the lofty revolutionary ideals, countless revolutionary martyrs heroically sacrificed in battle. Their spirit will last forever, and their glorious deeds will be recorded in history. Inside our army, officers and soldiers are equal and as close as family members. Brother units work together with one heart and support each other. Cadres set an example, take the lead, charge ahead, retreat behind, and usually care about the soldiers' lives and hardships, check beds and sentry posts, and ask about their well-being. The maintenance of discipline in our army does not simply rely on the restraint of superiors, but is built on the basis of conscious observance by all officers and soldiers. Because all commanders and fighters of the army have a high degree of political consciousness, coupled with the unity of the army and the people, and the unity of officers and soldiers, our army can defeat superior enemies with inferior equipment and achieve victory in successive revolutionary wars.
    At present, our country is in a great period of construction. The socialist revolution has achieved a basic victory, and socialist construction has achieved great results. The task of the Chinese People's Liberation Army is to strengthen national defense, consolidate the achievements of the revolutionary victory, and defend the socialist construction of the motherland. Our army is now marching along the road of modernizing the army, and has developed from a single service—the infantry—into a combined arms force with various new types of weapons and equipment. In addition to a strong army with various arms, we now have a fairly strong air force and a navy with strong combat capabilities.
    In order to strengthen national defense and defend socialist construction, all commanders and fighters of the army must strengthen combat readiness, raise vigilance, strive to improve military technology, master the weapons in their hands proficiently, and, according to the needs of future wars and the characteristics of our country's terrain, climate, and transportation, as well as the existing equipment of our army and the equipment that may be obtained in the future, step up the training of modern combined arms forces; and be ready at any time to respond to the call of the motherland, and strive to defend our country's territorial integrity and sovereignty, liberate our territory of Taiwan, crush imperialist aggression, and defend peace in the Far East and the world!
    In order to strengthen national defense and defend socialist construction, we must carry forward the fine traditions of our army and forever maintain the essence of the people's army. In the modernization of the army and in future operations, the army needs the support of the people even more. Without the support of the people of the whole country, it is impossible to build a modern revolutionary army, and it is impossible to win victory in the struggle to crush imperialist aggression in the future. Therefore, the army must strengthen its unity with the people, care about the interests of the people, abide by government laws and regulations, understand the local social situation, accept the supervision of the local government, and use training gaps to help the people with spring plowing, autumn harvesting, repairing dikes, digging canals, disaster relief, and disaster relief. The troops stationed in ethnic minority areas must especially respect the customs and habits of the local people and correctly implement the Party and government's ethnic policies. Those phenomena that are divorced from the masses, do not care about the interests of the people, do not abide by government laws and regulations, the army occupies civilian houses for a long time, the demarcation of military restricted areas is too large, and too much land is requisitioned for building barracks, warehouses, airports, shooting ranges, and constructing national defense projects must be resolutely corrected. Within the army, we must strengthen the unity of officers and soldiers, promote political democracy, military democracy, and economic democracy, and adopt the working methods of democracy under leadership and the mass line to give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of officers and soldiers. Soldiers must respect officers and obey orders; officers must love soldiers, listen to soldiers' opinions, care about soldiers' lives and hardships, and oppose commandism and warlordism. Of course, this kind of democracy has nothing in common with extreme democratization. Unorganized and undisciplined actions that do not execute orders are not allowed at any time. The common regulations are the norms of army life. The parts that are not reasonable enough and are not suitable for the current situation of our army are being studied and revised, but the original regulations should still be resolutely implemented before the new regulations are issued. We must strengthen the ideological education of all officers and soldiers, and educate all officers and soldiers with the Marxist-Leninist stand, viewpoint, and method. Every revolutionary soldier should establish the idea of serving the people forever, and be willing to sacrifice everything for the interests of the people, and be ready to dedicate their lives to defend the motherland at any time. Those ideas that do not compare work and contributions to the people, but specialize in personal reputation, status, and treatment, forget the past hardships, and only seek comfort and ease must be resolutely opposed. We must continue to carry forward our army's fine tradition of hard work and plain living, advocate building the army with diligence and thrift, and use the country's limited military expenditures for aspects that have the most direct impact on improving the army's combat effectiveness. Sanatoriums, auditoriums, nurseries, elementary schools for children, etc., should generally be stopped from construction, and funds that can be used or not should be resolutely not used. Every penny of the country comes from the hard work of the people, so we must be careful and meticulous, and any extravagance and waste are not allowed. All commanders and fighters of the army must conscientiously cherish weapons, equipment, horses, military supplies, and all equipment and materials, and oppose the tendency to like the new and dislike the old, and to value money and despise things. Political work is the lifeline of our army, and it plays a decisive role in consolidating unity, improving combat effectiveness, ensuring victory in combat, and implementing the Party's policies in the army. It must not only not be weakened in the modernization of the army, but must be further strengthened.
    To build a modern revolutionary army, we must reduce the number of troops and improve the quality of the troops. On the one hand, in order to concentrate manpower, material resources, and financial resources to realize our country's socialist industrialization, so that our country's national defense is built on the basis of a strong industry, we must reduce military expenditures and reduce the number of standing armies. On the other hand, only by reducing the number of troops, implementing the army's peacetime establishment, and strengthening the latest equipment and training can we improve the quality of the army. Reducing and reorganizing the army does not weaken the national defense force, but further strengthens the national defense force; it does not reduce the army's responsibility, but further increases the army's responsibility. Therefore, in addition to strengthening combat readiness and strengthening training, we must strengthen conscription work and the accumulation and training of reserve forces in order to solve the contradiction of having fewer troops in peacetime and more troops in wartime. The militia has played an important role in previous revolutionary wars, and will continue to be a powerful assistant to the army in future operations, and will become the basis for forming second-line corps in wartime. Organizing and training the reserve force should be combined with organizing and training the militia, and demobilized soldiers should be organized to become the backbone of organizing and training the militia and organizing and training the reserve force, which can play a very important role. Millions of demobilized soldiers across the country have gained training in the war and are a valuable asset of the country. On the one hand, demobilized soldiers should actively participate in production, abide by government laws and regulations, and bring the fine traditions of our army to the production posts. On the other hand, in addition to properly resettling demobilized soldiers, we should also strengthen their education and use, and give play to their enthusiasm in the production posts. Once the country is in trouble, we must still mobilize them to pick up weapons and return to the combat posts. Therefore, the issue for demobilized soldiers is not only how to resettle them, but also how to use them, which is more meaningful.
    To build a modern revolutionary army, we must strengthen the research on modern military science. On the one hand, we must systematically summarize, inherit, and carry forward our army's past experience in army building and combat experience. On the other hand, we must conscientiously learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet army. The Soviet army defeated German fascism in the Great Patriotic War and helped the Chinese people defeat the Japanese aggressors. Not only is its technical equipment advanced and first-rate, but it has also accumulated rich experience in commanding modern army operations. Of course, we should also learn from the advanced experience of the armies of other fraternal countries. We should also study the military science and technology of capitalist countries in order to achieve the goal of knowing ourselves and knowing our enemies. But no matter whether we summarize our own experience or learn from the experience of others, we must combine it with the current specific situation of our army and the needs of future operations, absorb the good and useful parts, and neither deny everything nor mechanically copy it.
    In order to better unite the people of the whole country and build socialism, the Party Central Committee has issued instructions to the whole Party to launch a rectification movement. We must respond to the Party's call, launch a rectification movement in the army, thoroughly expose the shortcomings and errors in our work, and resolutely overcome bureaucratism, sectarianism, and subjectivism in order to better build a modern revolutionary army. In the current anti-rightist struggle, all commanders and fighters of the army must distinguish right from wrong and stand firm. Rightists took advantage of the opportunity of our Party's rectification to publish anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks and carry out anti-Party and anti-socialist activities, attempting to usurp leadership and overthrow the people's democratic dictatorship. We must actively participate in this struggle, resolutely fight back against the attacks of the rightists, and never allow the conspiracies of the rightists to succeed.
    Due to the unity and strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the continuous growth of the world's peace forces, the current international situation is developing in a direction that is conducive to striving for lasting world peace. However, the aggressive bloc headed by US imperialism is still continuing its frenzied arms race, establishing military bases around the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries, stepping up the arming of West Germany and Japan, and developing nuclear and missile weapons. In the Far East, US imperialism continues to occupy our territory of Taiwan, subverts our Tibet, obstructs the peaceful reunification of Vietnam, interferes in the internal affairs of Laos, and plots to undermine the Geneva Accords. Recently, it unilaterally announced the abolition of Article 13, paragraph 2 of the Korean Armistice Agreement, transported B57 and F100 aircraft carrying atomic bombs into South Korea, and transformed the US Army's 7th Infantry Division and 24th Division stationed in South Korea into "five-atomic organization" divisions, equipped with "Honest John" rockets that can launch atomic warheads, and established a "Matador" missile base in our territory of Taiwan that can launch atomic warheads. Therefore, the threat of war still exists, and we must be vigilant at all times and not be paralyzed by peace in the slightest.
    The military experts of the imperialist aggressor bloc are constantly clamoring for nuclear war, attempting to take preemptive action and destroy the socialist camp with nuclear war. However, their wishful thinking is wrong. We recognize that nuclear weapons have great destructive power and considerable killing effect, but they can never complete the task of occupation, let alone achieve the goal of conquest. In the end, the victory or defeat on the battlefield still depends on the army, which is mainly infantry. In the past, we started from scratch and annihilated more than 8 million Kuomintang troops equipped with US equipment in the Third Domestic Revolutionary War. Can nuclear weapons scare us? Moreover, nuclear weapons are now owned by both the socialist camp and the imperialist camp, and the situation of monopoly by one party is gone forever. The justness of the war and the support of the people are the decisive factors for the victory of the war. The socialist camp not only has a large population and abundant resources, is completely connected geographically, and has a solid material and technical foundation; but also because the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries have always stood on the side of justice and resolutely adopted policies to safeguard peace, it has won the support of the broad masses of people all over the world. US imperialism has insufficient troops, too long a front, travels across the oceans, and has difficulty in supplying. In addition, the internal contradictions of the imperialist camp and the unjust nature of the war not only fail to win the support of the people at home, but also suffer from the opposition of peace-loving people all over the world. If the aggressive bloc headed by US imperialism dares to take the risk of launching a third world war, we will surely win, and the imperialists will perish themselves.
    Of course, we must not be paralyzed by peace and relax our efforts to strengthen national defense. When we are building a beautiful socialist mansion, we must set up sentries at the door. I hope that the people of the whole country will strengthen their national defense awareness, vigorously support national defense construction, and suggest that scientists enthusiastically participate in the research of national defense science and technology to contribute their strength to defend the motherland. In future wars, both the front and the rear, even the strategic deep rear, may be attacked. Therefore, while the country is carrying out large-scale economic construction, the industrial base should be appropriately dispersed, the urban population should not be excessively concentrated, and people's air defense work should be strengthened to prevent problems before they occur. In short, we must achieve "preparedness averts peril." Without strengthening national defense, it is impossible to consolidate the achievements of the revolutionary victory, it is impossible to defend the socialist construction of the motherland, and it is impossible to defend the fruits of labor and the happy and beautiful future of each of us.
    We love peace and oppose war. We firmly advocate the prohibition of nuclear weapons and the realization of universal disarmament. We adhere to the five principles of international relations and advocate peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. We will never invade others, but we will never allow others to invade us. If the imperialists impose war on us, we will give the aggressors a resolute counterattack.
    On the occasion of commemorating the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, we are willing to work with the people of the whole country, with our great ally the Soviet Union and the armies and people of other fraternal countries, and with the peace-loving people all over the world, to stop aggression, oppose war, and strive for lasting world peace!

    加强国防，巩固革命胜利果实！
    ——为纪念中国人民解放军建军三十周年而作
    中国人民解放军总参谋长　粟裕
    今年8月1日，是中国人民解放军建军三十周年纪念日。回顾一下我军历史，从无到有，从小到大，从弱到强，经过一条漫长曲折的道路，粉碎了国内外强大敌人的无数次进攻，取得了中国革命战争的胜利。当然，也遭受过一些挫折，付出了相当大的代价，然而经过千锤百炼，已使我军锻炼成为一支不可战胜的力量。
    中国人民解放军之所以不可战胜，是由于中国共产党的正确领导。中国革命的特点，是武装的革命，反对武装的反革命。在长期革命斗争中，中国共产党不仅给中国人民指出了明确的斗争方向，而且积累了领导武装斗争的丰富经验，制定了一条完全适合中国情况的正确军事路线。这条军事路线，已在毛主席的著作中作了科学的分析和系统的阐明，它的主要内容是：以劣势装备战胜优势敌人，必须采取战略上的持久战和战役、战术上的速决战，在战争初期采取积极防御的方针，大量消耗敌人，增强自己力量，尔后经过相持，转入反攻；以农村包围城市，先夺取广大农村和中、小城市，后夺取大城市；以歼灭敌人有生力量为主要目标，不争一城一地的得失，每战集中绝对优势兵力于主攻方向，力求全歼或予敌人以歼灭性打击；运动战、阵地战、游击战三者密切结合，力求在运动中歼灭敌人，发挥我军作战的机动性和灵活性，坚持统一指挥下的密切协同。党中央和毛主席所制定的建军原则和作战原则，不仅在过去极端艰苦的条件下，引导了中国革命战争走向胜利，而且在现代化建军和今后粉碎帝国主义侵略的斗争中，仍然是我们必须坚决遵循的指导思想。
    中国人民解放军之所以不可战胜，是由于广大人民的拥护和支援。我军为人民的利益而战，来自人民，全心全意为人民服务，纪律严明，对人民秋毫无犯。每个战士均能自觉遵守“三大纪律、八项注意”，说话和气，买卖公平，借物归还，损坏赔偿，不拿群众一针一线，并于战斗空隙帮助群众进行生产。广大人民从亲身体验中认识到我军作战的目的和宗旨，把我军看成人民自己的“子弟兵”，军民关系像鱼水一样密切。在战争的年代里，人民省出自己的口粮，支援前线，动员自己的儿女和丈夫参加军队，成千上万的运输队、担架队，帮助我军输送粮弹，救护伤员。在自愿的基础上组织起来的民兵，站岗放哨，侦察敌情，捉拿敌探，带路送信，并开展袭击、爆破运动，打击和扰乱敌人，造成敌人的疲劳和恐惧，直接配合我军作战。由于广大人民的拥护和支援，使我军获得了战胜敌人的许多有利条件。
    中国人民解放军之所以不可战胜，是由于全军指战员的高度政治觉悟。我军的每个成员，都懂得为谁而战，在战斗中不畏艰苦，不怕牺牲，勇往直前，顽强不屈。我军长期与优势的敌人作战，装备低劣，弹药极少，衣食不足，医药奇缺。二万五千里长征，越雪山、过草地，战胜了人间罕有的困难，创造了世界军事史上的空前奇迹。红军主力北上后留下的少数部队，备尝艰辛，粉碎了敌人千百次的清剿、扫荡，坚持了南方八省的三年游击战争。为了实现崇高的革命理想，无数革命先烈在战斗中英勇牺牲了，他们的精神永垂不朽，他们的光荣事迹将永留于史册。我军内部官兵平等，亲如家人，兄弟部队齐心合力，相互支援。干部以身作则，身先士卒，冲锋在前，退却在后，平时关心士兵生活疾苦，查铺查哨，问寒问暖。我军纪律的维持，不是单纯依靠上级的约束，而是建筑在全体官兵自觉遵守的基础之上。由于全军指战员具有高度的政治觉悟，加上军民一致，官兵一致，我军才能以劣势装备战胜优势敌人，取得历次革命战争的胜利。
    目前，我们的国家正处在一个伟大的建设时期，社会主义革命已取得基本胜利，社会主义建设已取得巨大成绩。中国人民解放军的任务是：加强国防，巩固革命胜利成果，保卫祖国的社会主义建设。我军现正沿着现代化建军的道路迈进，并已由过去的单一兵种——步兵，发展成为拥有各种新式武器装备的诸兵种合成军队。除有强大的陆军诸兵种以外，我们已有了一支相当强大的空军和一支具有坚强战斗力的海军。
    为了加强国防，保卫社会主义建设，全军指战员必须加强战备，提高警惕；努力提高军事技术，熟练掌握手中武器，根据今后战争需要和我国地形、气候、交通等特点以及我军现有装备和将来可能获得的装备，加紧现代化的诸兵种合成军队训练；并随时准备响应祖国召唤，为保卫我国领土、主权完整、解放我国领土台湾、粉碎帝国主义侵略、保卫远东和世界和平而奋斗！
    为了加强国防，保卫社会主义建设，必须发扬我军优良传统，永远保持人民军队的本质。在现代化建军和今后作战中，军队更加需要人民的支援，没有全国人民的支援，就不可能建设一支现代化的革命军队，就不可能在今后粉碎帝国主义侵略的斗争中取得胜利。因此，军队必须加强与人民的团结，关心人民利益，遵守政府法令，了解当地社会情况，接受当地政府监督，并利用训练空隙，帮助人民进行春耕、秋收、修堤、挖渠、抢险、救灾。驻守少数民族地区的军队，尤须尊重当地人民风俗习惯，正确执行党和政府的民族政策。那种脱离群众、不关心人民利益、不遵守政府法令、军队长期占用民房、军事禁区圈划太大、修建营房、仓库、机场、靶场和构筑国防工程时征购土地太多的现象，必须坚决纠正。在军队内部，必须加强官兵团结，发扬政治民主、军事民主和经济民主，采取有领导的民主和群众路线的工作方法，来发挥广大官兵的积极性和创造性。士兵必须尊敬军官，服从命令；军官必须爱护士兵，倾听士兵意见，关心士兵生活疾苦，反对命令主义和军阀主义。当然，这种民主和极端民主化毫无共同之点，不执行命令的无组织、无纪律行动，在任何时候都是不允许的。共同条令是军队生活的准则，其中个别规定得不够合理和不适合目前我军情况的部分，现正研究修改，但在新的条令未颁发前，仍应坚决执行原有条令。必须加强对全体官兵的思想教育工作，以马克思列宁主义的立场、观点和方法，来教育全体官兵。每一个革命军人，应树立永远为人民服务的思想，为了人民的利益，不惜牺牲个人一切，并随时准备为了保卫祖国而献出自己的生命。那种不比工作和对人民的贡献，专门计较个人名誉、地位和待遇、忘记了过去的艰难困苦、只图舒适安逸的思想，必须坚决反对。必须继续发扬我军艰苦朴素的优良传统，提倡勤俭建军，将国家的有限军费，用于对提高军队战斗力最有直接影响的方面。疗养院、大礼堂、托儿所、子弟小学等等，一般应停止修建，可用可不用的经费，应坚决不用。国家的每一分钱，均来自人民的辛勤劳动，必须精打细算，任何铺张浪费都是不应该的。全军指战员必须认真爱护武器、装备、马匹、军需和一切器材物资，反对喜新厌旧、重财轻物的倾向。政治工作是我军的生命线，对巩固团结、提高战斗力、保证作战胜利和党的政策在军队中贯彻执行，均有决定作用，在现代化建军中不但不能削弱，更须进一步加强。
    要建设一支现代化的革命军队，必须减少军队数量，提高军队质量。一方面，为了集中人力、物力、财力，实现我国的社会主义工业化，从而使我国国防建立在有强大工业作后盾的基础上，必须削减军费开支，裁减常备军的数量。另一方面，只有减少军队数量，实行军队的平时编制，加强最新的装备和训练，才能提高军队质量。裁减和整编军队，不是使国防力量削弱，而是使国防力量进一步加强；不是使军队的责任减轻，而是使军队的责任进一步加重。因此，除了加强战备和加强训练外，必须加强兵役工作和对后备力量的积蓄培养，才能解决平时养兵少、战时用兵多的矛盾。民兵在历次革命战争中均曾发挥过重要作用，今后仍然是军队作战的有力助手，并将成为战时组建二线兵团的基础。组训预备役应与组训民兵结合进行，并应将复员军人组织起来，成为组训民兵和组训预备役的骨干，当可发挥极重要的作用。全国数百万复员军人，他们在战争中获得了锻炼，是国家的一项宝贵财产。一方面，复员军人应积极参加生产，遵守政府法令，并将我军的优良传统，带到生产岗位上去。另一方面，我们对复员军人除进行妥善安置外，还应加强对他们的教育和使用，发挥他们在生产岗位上的积极性，一旦国家有事，仍须动员他们拿起武器，重新走上战斗的岗位。因此，对复员军人不仅是如何安置而更是如何使用的问题，这样才更有积极意义。
    要建设一支现代化的革命军队，必须加强对现代军事科学的研究。一方面，对于我军以往的建军经验和作战经验，必须有系统地总结，加以继承和发扬。另一方面，必须认真学习苏军的先进经验。苏军在卫国战争中打败了德国法西斯，并帮助中国人民打败了日本侵略者，不仅它的技术装备是先进的、头等的，而且积累了指挥现代化军队作战的丰富经验。当然，我们也应该学习其他兄弟国家军队的先进经验。对于资本主义国家的军事科学技术，我们也要加以研究，才能达到知彼知己的目的。但是不论总结自己的经验，或是学习别人的经验，都要结合我军当前具体情况和今后作战需要，吸取好的和有用的部分，既不能否定一切，也不能机械搬用。
    为了更好地团结全国人民，建设社会主义，党中央已向全党发出指示开展整风运动。我们必须响应党的号召，开展军队中的整风运动，彻底揭露工作中的缺点和错误，坚决克服官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义，为更好地建设一支现代化的革命军队而努力。在当前的反右派斗争中，全军指战员必须明辨是非，站稳立场。右派分子利用我党整风的机会，发表反党、反社会主义的言论，进行反党、反社会主义的活动，妄图篡夺领导，推翻人民民主专政。我们必须积极参加到这一斗争中去，坚决反击右派分子的进攻，决不允许右派分子的阴谋得逞。
    由于以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结和强大，由于世界和平力量的不断壮大，目前国际局势正朝着有利于争取世界持久和平的方向发展。但是以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团，仍继续疯狂备战，在苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家周围遍设军事基地，加紧武装西德、日本，发展核子、导弹武器。在远东，美帝国主义仍继续霸占我国领土台湾，对我国西藏进行颠覆活动，阻挠越南和平统一，干涉老挝内政，阴谋破坏日内瓦协议。最近，竟片面宣布废除朝鲜停战协定第十三款卯项，将携载原子弹的B57和F100飞机运入南朝鲜，将驻在南朝鲜的美军步兵第7师、第24师改为“五原子编制”师，装备能发射原子弹头的“诚实约翰”火箭，并在我国领土台湾设立能发射原子弹头的“斗牛士”导弹基地。因此，战争的威胁依然存在，我们在任何时候都必须提高警惕，不能有丝毫和平麻痹。
    帝国主义侵略集团的军事家们不断叫嚣核子战争，妄图采取先发制人，以核子战争摧毁社会主义阵营。可是，他们的如意算盘打错了。我们承认核子武器有巨大的破坏威力和相当大的杀伤效能，但它决不能完成占领任务，更不能达到征服目的，最后决定战场上的胜负，仍然要依靠以步兵为主体的陆军。过去我们白手起家，在第三次国内革命战争中歼灭了八百多万美械装备的国民党军队，难道核子武器就能吓倒我们吗？何况核子武器已为社会主义阵营和帝国主义阵营双方所有，一方垄断的局面已一去不再复返。战争的正义性和人民的拥护，是战争胜利的决定因素。社会主义阵营不仅人口众多，资源丰富，在地理上完全联成一片，拥有雄厚的物质、技术基础；而且由于苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家一贯站在正义的立场，坚决采取维护和平的政策，获得了全世界广大人民的拥护。美帝国主义兵力不足，战线太长，远涉重洋，补给困难，加上帝国主义阵营的内部矛盾和战争的非正义性，不仅得不到国内人民的拥护，而且遭受全世界爱好和平人民的反对。以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团如敢于冒险发动第三次世界大战，我们一定能取得胜利，帝国主义者必将自取灭亡。
    当然，我们决不能和平麻痹而放松了对于加强国防的努力。当我们正在建设一座美好的社会主义大厦时，必须在门口设上哨兵。希望全国人民加强国防观念，大力支援国防建设，并建议科学家们热烈参加国防科学技术的研究，为保卫祖国贡献出自己的力量。在未来战争中，不论前方、后方，即使是战略的深远后方，均有遭受袭击的可能。因此，在国家进行大规模经济建设的同时，工业基地要适当疏散，城市人口不宜过分集中，并应加强人民防空工作，以防患于未然。总之，我们必须做到“有备无患”。不加强国防，就不可能巩固革命胜利成果，就不可能保卫祖国的社会主义建设，也就不可能保卫我们每一个人的劳动成果和幸福美好的未来。
    我们爱好和平，反对战争。我们坚决主张禁用核子武器，实现普遍裁军。我们奉行国际关系中的五项原则，主张不同社会制度国家的和平共处。我们绝不侵略别人，但也决不允许别人侵略我们。如果帝国主义者将战争强加于我们时，我们将给予侵略者以坚决回击。
    值此纪念中国人民解放军建军三十周年之际，我们愿与全国人民一起，与我们的伟大盟邦苏联及其他兄弟国家的军队和人民一起，与全世界爱好和平的人民一起，为制止侵略、反对战争、争取世界持久和平而共同努力！
