　  Huizhou pearl orchid tea has always won the praise of the broad masses of people for its unique fragrance. This year's climate is suitable for the growth of pearl orchids, and it is expected to increase production by more than 50% compared to last year. Due to the increased production of fragrant flowers, the workers of She County Tea Factory are also particularly busy. After the fragrant flowers are processed, large quantities of boxed flower tea are shipped from the factory almost every day, and are continuously transported and sold throughout the country.

　  徽州花茶上市
    本报讯　徽州珠兰花茶，素来以它特有的清香，博得了广大人民的赞扬。今年的气候适宜于珠兰花生长，预计比去年增产50％以上。由于香花增产，歙县茶厂的工人也显得特别繁忙，香花经过加工以后，差不多每天都有大批成箱的花茶出厂，源源不断地运销全国。
