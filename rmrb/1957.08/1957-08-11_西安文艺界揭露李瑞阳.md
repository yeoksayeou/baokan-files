On the Anti-Rightist Front

    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch, Xi'an: Literary and art figures in Xi'an City have been holding meetings for days to expose and criticize the reactionary words and deeds of the rightist Li Ruiyang.

    Li Ruiyang is a standing committee member of the Xi'an City Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the deputy director of the Xi'an City Literary and Art Branch of the China Democratic League. As early as February, he held a symposium for the opera community under the guise of the "Literary and Art Branch" with ulterior motives. He incited everyone to "complain and fight" against the Party on issues ranging from opera reform policies to personnel arrangements. After the rectification campaign began, the "Literary and Art Branch" held座谈会 once a week. Under the chairmanship of Li Ruiyang, the座谈会 became a place for openly planning attacks against the Party. During the "放鸣" (letting people speak out) period, he went to the Shaanxi Provincial Opera Theater twice to help another member of the China Democratic League there revise articles attacking the Party. Li Ruiyang also went to Yuan Baitao, a rightist in the Xi'an Branch of the Artists Association, several times to plan attacks against the Party. He also attempted to make the Communist Party relinquish its leadership in the Quyi (folk art) community. He arrogantly claimed that "without the leadership of the Party, the masses will consciously rise up." Under the righteous criticism of the masses, Li Ruiyang has begun to admit to some of his reactionary words and deeds.

    西安文艺界揭露李瑞阳
    新华社专稿　西安市文艺界人士连日集会，揭露和批判右派分子李瑞阳的反动言行。
    李瑞阳是西安市文联常务委员，民盟西安市文艺支部副主任委员。早在2月间，他就别有用心地以“文艺支部”的名义，召开了一次戏曲界座谈会。煽动大家要从戏曲改革政策到人事安排等方面，来向党“发牢骚，作斗争”。整风开始以后，“文艺支部”每周座谈一次。在李瑞阳的主持下，座谈会竟成了公开筹划向党进攻的场所。“鸣放”期间，他曾两次去陕西省戏曲剧院，代那里的另一个盟员修改攻击党的文章。李瑞阳还几次到美协西安分会右派分子袁白涛那里，策划向党进攻。他还企图让共产党从曲艺界让出领导权来。他嚣张地声称“不要党的领导，群众也会自觉起来”。李瑞阳在群众的正义批驳下，已开始承认了一部分反动言行。
