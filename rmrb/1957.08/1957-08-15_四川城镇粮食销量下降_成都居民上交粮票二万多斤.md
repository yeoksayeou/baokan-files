Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, August 12th. Since Sichuan Province’s various cities and towns began rectifying the unified grain sales system, grain sales have gradually declined. According to statistics from the Sichuan Provincial Grain Bureau, grain sales in July decreased by more than 30 million jin compared to June. Currently, the provincial grain department is further controlling grain sales in urban areas, requiring that grain supply for the second half of this year be stabilized at the sales level of the first half. With the exception of newly built industrial and mining areas and natural population growth, it has been decided that grain sales will not be increased. Grain usage for service industries will also not be increased before the peak season in September; only some adjustments in grain usage between regions and industries will be made.

In the second quarter of this year, Sichuan’s urban grain sales targets increased by 8.95% compared to the first quarter. This situation immediately attracted the attention of the grain department. In late June and early July, Wanxian, Zizhong, Rongxian, Tongnan and other places, combined with the reissuance of grain supply certificates, conducted grain consumption inspections and education on saving grain among urban residents. After mobilization and education, residents of Chengdu voluntarily handed over more than 25,000 jin of surplus grain coupons in June. This also increased the average monthly grain savings per person in the city from 5.36 liang to 7.35 liang during the second quarter, reversing the abnormal phenomenon of rising grain sales month by month.

    四川城镇粮食销量下降
    成都居民上交粮票二万多斤
    新华社成都12日电　四川省各市镇开展整顿粮食统销工作以来，粮食销售量逐渐下降。据四川省粮食厅统计，7月份的粮食销售量比6月份减少三千多万斤。现在，省粮食部门正在进一步控制城镇粮食销售量，要求今年下半年度把粮食供应稳定在上半年的销售水平上。除了新建工矿地区和人口自然增殖以外，决定不再增加粮食的销量。对于服务性行业用粮，在9月旺季未到以前也不再增加，只进行一些地区、行业之间的用粮调整。
    今年第二季度四川市镇粮食销售指标比第一季度增加了8.95％。这一情况当即引起粮食部门的注意。在6月底和7月初，万县、资中、荣县、潼南等地都结合换发粮食供应证，在城镇居民中进行了用粮检查和节约用粮的教育。成都市居民经过动员教育以后，6月份自动交出了多余的粮票两万五千多斤，并且使第二季度内全市平均每人每月节约粮食由五点三六两增加到七点三五两，扭转了粮食销量逐月上升的不正常现象。
