    What is Xu Jie Doing at East China Normal University?
    Wang Daoqian
    Xu Jie is the Head of the Chinese Language and Literature Department at East China Normal University, the Director of the China Democratic League Branch at the university, and also the Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Writers Association.
    After Xu Jie attended the Propaganda Conference of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in March of this year, he returned to Shanghai and ignited the fire in the rectification movement at East China Normal University, attempting to use this school as a key point to create so-called "experiences in helping the Party to rectify its work."
    The means Xu Jie adopted at this normal university were: organizing right-wing elements, inciting some people with grievances, and forming an anti-Party force. First, he held a series of China Democratic League group meetings in the Chinese Department, refusing the participation of the Communist Party General Branch Secretary, and released anti-Party remarks at the group meetings, influencing students. As a result, a few students put up big-character posters attacking the Party General Branch Secretary, scolding the General Branch Secretary as a "shameless degenerate Party member" and telling her to "go home and take care of her children" (the Secretary was a female comrade). Later, Xu Jie, under the guise of helping the Party to rectify its work, convened a symposium of teachers, including League members and non-League members, in the name of the China Democratic League branch, stirring up dissatisfaction among some people with the school's anti-rightist work, attempting to obliterate the achievements of the anti-rightist campaign. He further used his authority as the department head to convene a meeting of all teachers in the department in the name of the Party General Branch Secretary. This teacher meeting, convened in the name of the CCP General Branch, was chaired by Xu Zhongyu, a right-wing element and member of the China Democratic League, at Xu Jie's suggestion. At this meeting, the Party General Branch Secretary was again scolded, some people proposed that the Party rectification meeting be convened by a non-Party president and department head (i.e., Xu Jie), and some even proposed that the "organizational discipline" "wall" within the Communist Party should also be torn down, calling on young Party members to oppose the Party leaders. Xu Jie spoke several times at this meeting, adding fuel to the fire, and "appealed for justice" for Shi Zhecun, a right-wing element who had been consistently anti-Communist for more than 20 years. Xu Jie repeatedly advocated expanding the "rectification" at the normal university to society. At a meeting of China Democratic League leaders of various universities convened by the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, he introduced his "experiences" and attacked the university's Party committee. At the same time, he wrote an "open letter" to the university's Party committee and submitted it to Wenhui Bao. In this letter, Xu Jie claimed that "we have a responsibility to help you do a good job in rectification." East China Normal University was one of the first to "speak out" and "contend" in Shanghai, and countless large and small meetings had been held, but Xu Jie insisted that the university's Party committee had "concerns" about "speaking out" and "contending"; anti-Party slogans had already appeared in the school, but he said: "The large numbers of big-character posters and blackboard newspapers that the students of the whole school have put up" do not have "any abnormal or unhealthy phenomena." Xu Jie ridiculed the big-character posters that refuted reactionary remarks and regarded the correct remarks as "someone taking the opportunity to make trouble." In the open letter, Xu Jie also raised the issue of lecturer evaluation, stirring up dissatisfaction among young teachers towards the Party. He said: "Regarding personnel arrangements, it cannot be said that there are too few grievances left over from the anti-rightist and evaluation work!" This was an attempt to encourage all those with "grievances" to fight against the Party. He said: "The chess move made by Chairman Mao is a risky move," and "under this risky move, many Party members will lose their prestige, creating a sense of inferiority and being unable to hold their heads up." Xu Jie attempted to stir up dissatisfaction among Party members towards the Party Central Committee. In the open letter, he also said, "It is said that the teachers of Fudan University also have such opinions!" Xu Jie's conspiracy was clear: he wanted to disrupt the rectification steps, overthrow the leadership of the Party committee, and cause chaos in all universities in Shanghai. This open letter was not published, and later Xu Jie withdrew it when he saw the situation was not right.
    Xu Jie "took command" at East China Normal University in the guise of a leader of right-wing elements. Another right-wing element who colluded with him was Dai Jiaxiang, a teacher in the History Department who set fires. This Dai Jiaxiang, under the pseudonym "Chu Ge," wrote an extremely reactionary "Letter to All Students," instructing a student right-wing element to put up big-character posters, attempting to incite all students. Xu Jie was the one who originally introduced Dai to East China Normal University. When "anti-Communist and anti-Russian" leaflets appeared in the school, and someone pointed out that this was beyond the scope of the constitution, Xu Jie defended, "What does this have to do with the constitution?" When someone mentioned "the root of the three major isms," Xu Jie said, "The root of the three major isms is the socialist system." When someone said that the department did not need a Party General Branch, Xu Jie said, "The Party General Branch in the department can be like a democratic party," advocating "sharing the spotlight" and "standing on equal footing" with the Party. The Party's rectification spirit is gentle and aims to cure illnesses and save people, but Xu Jie advocated holding large-scale meetings, using broadcasting, and "mutually influencing" both inside and outside the school, to make it "lively" and "blossom everywhere." He said, "Small-scale symposiums are formalism, for reporting to higher authorities," and are "mutually isolated" and "block information"... Xu Jie's mask of a "progressive professor" was finally torn off, and the teachers, students, and staff of East China Normal University, under the leadership of the Party, finally exposed his right-wing anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiracy.
    In history, Xu Jie had twice infiltrated the Communist Party, twice joined the Kuomintang, and later joined the China Democratic League. In the days before the Crossing-the-Yangtze Campaign during the Liberation War, he went everywhere to solicit signatures to publish a declaration demanding "continued peace talks between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party." After liberation, Xu Jie again raised the issue of joining the Party. Xu Jie is a opportunist. He had also acted as an anti-Communist "hero." In the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, in order to become the principal of a middle school, he colluded with the Kuomintang county magistrate to expel Communist Party members. In this right-wing attack on the Party, he again became a "heroic" figure. In 1945, the Shangrao War Zone Publishing House published a collection of literary criticism theory by him called "Literature, Criticism, and Life." This was a work in which he promoted literature to serve the "highest national policy" of Chiang Kai-shek's dynasty under the command of Gu Zhutong's anti-Communist base camp in the Third War Zone, commanding the so-called "Southeast Literary Movement," talking a lot about his "literary freedom theory," vigorously promoting the "cultural construction" of the Kuomintang, and vigorously preaching theoretically for the cultural spies Zhang Daofan and Chen Quan's "National Literature Movement," using the guise of discussing the issue of "national form" to confuse young people and confuse right and wrong, saying something like "The national literature movement proposed by Professor Chen Quan should be regarded as a further development of the issue of national form after the War of Resistance..." and so on.
    After the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" was put forward, Xu Jie wrote many articles, appearing in the guise of an anti-dogmatism "hero." Whether in articles or at symposiums (even at reports to young literary workers), he did not relax his attacks on the Party's leadership and Marxist principles in the field of culture and art. He said: "The prevalence of criticism in the style of labeling is inseparable from a series of movements in the literary and art circles over a long period of time, such as rectification, ideological remolding, and criticism of bourgeois literary and artistic thought, and elimination of Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary literary and artistic thought." He said that many literary criticisms are "opportunistic," and many literary criticisms are based on individualistic positions, and he hates young authors in the field of literary theory and criticism; he angrily asked: Estimate how much "breastfeeding ability" you have! He distorted the policy of "Let a hundred schools of thought contend" into a "two-point theory" in which Marxism-Leninism and all bourgeois idealism "share the spotlight." The reason why Xu Jie took advantage of the "Let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy to create so much trouble was to oppose the correct literary criticism of Marxism in order to peddle his revisionist private goods.
    Currently, East China Normal University is launching a struggle against Xu Jie, but Xu Jie has not yet specifically confessed his problems. Xu Jie has two paths in front of him: one is the path of self-destruction from the people, and the other is the path of confessing clearly to the people and bowing his head in admitting his guilt.

    许杰在华东师范大学干些什么
    王道乾
    许杰是华东师范大学中国文学系主任，民盟师大支部主任委员，同时又是中国作家协会上海分会副主席。
    今年3月许杰参加中共中央宣传会议之后，回到上海，便在华东师大整风运动中点起火来，企图以这个学校为重点，创造所谓“帮助党整风的经验”。
    许杰在这个师范大学所采取的手段是：组织右派分子，鼓动一些有不满情绪的人，形成一股反党的力量。首先，他在中文系召开一系列民盟小组会，拒绝共产党总支书记参加，在小组会上放出反党的言论，影响学生。于是少数学生出了攻击党总支书记的大字报，骂总支书记是“无耻的败党”，“滚回家抱孩子去”（书记是一位女同志）。许杰后来又以帮助党整风为名，用民盟支部名义召集包括盟员和非盟员的教师座谈会，煽起一部分人对学校肃反工作的不满情绪，企图抹杀肃反成绩。他更利用了系主任的职权，以党总支书记的名义召开全系教师大会。这个以中共总支名义召集的教师会议，在许杰建议下，却由右派分子、民盟盟员徐中玉主持。在这个会上，党总支书记又遭谩骂，有人提出由非党校长和系主任（即许杰）来召开共产党整风会议，有人甚至提出共产党内的“组织性、纪律性”这道“墙”也得拆掉，号召青年党员去反对党的领导人。许杰在这个会上数次发言，火上加油，并为二十多年来一贯反共的右派分子施蛰存“申冤”。许杰多次倡议把师大的“整风”扩大到社会上去。在民盟上海市委召开各高等学校民盟负责人的会议上，他介绍了他的“经验”，攻击了师大党委。与此同时，他写了一封给师大党委的“公开信”投到文汇报去。许杰在这封信里自称“帮助你们搞好整风，我们有这个责任”。华东师大在上海“鸣”“放”得最早，各种大会小会已开了不知多少次，但许杰一口咬定师大党委对“鸣”“放”有“顾虑”；学校反动标语已经出现，他却说：“全校学生蜂起云涌的大字报和黑板报”是没有“什么不正常不健康的现象”。许杰对反驳反动言论的大字报加以讽刺，对正确的言论，倒认为是“有人乘机捣乱”。许杰在公开信里还提出讲师评级问题，挑拨青年教师对党的不满。他说：“关于人事的安排，肃反和评级留下来的冤气，也就不能说是太少吧！”这是企图鼓动所有有“冤气”的人来向党斗争。他说：“毛主席所走的一着棋，是一着险棋”，“在这一着险棋之下，不少党员就会丧失威信，造成自卑感，抬不起头来。”许杰企图挑起党员对党中央的不满。他在公开信里还说什么“据说复旦大学的教师们，也有这样的意见呢！”许杰的阴谋是清楚的，他要打乱整风步骤，搞垮党委的领导，引起全上海高等学校的混乱。这封公开信没有发表，后来许杰见风头不对，自动取回。
    许杰在华东师大以右派分子的领袖姿态“挂帅”了。和他串连的另一右派分子是在历史系放火的教师戴家祥。这个戴家祥化名“楚歌”写了一篇极其反动的“告全体同学书”，指使一个学生右派分子出大字报，企图煽惑全体同学。原来介绍戴到华东师大的人就是许杰。当学校出现“反共抗俄”的传单，有人指出这是超出宪法的范围时，许杰辩护说：“这同宪法有什么联系？”当有人说到“三大主义的根源”时，许杰说：“三大主义的根源是社会主义制度。”当有人说系里不要党总支的时候，许杰说：“系内党总支也可像民主党派一样”，主张和党“平分秋色”“分庭抗礼”。党的整风精神是和风细雨、治病救人，许杰则主张开大会，用广播，校内校外“互相影响”，要搞得“热火朝天”“四面开花”。他说“小型座谈会是形式主义，是为向上级报账”，是“互相隔离”“封锁消息”……许杰的“进步教授”的假面具终于被撕破了，华东师大师生员工在党的领导下，终于揭破了他的右派的反党、反社会主义的阴谋。
    在历史上，许杰曾经两次混入共产党，两次加入国民党，后来又参加民盟。在解放战争渡江战役前几天，他到处拉人签名发表宣言，要求“国共继续和谈”。许杰在解放后，又向党提出入党问题来了。许杰是一个投机分子。他也曾经充当过反共的“英雄”，在抗战初期，他为了自己当一个中学校的校长，曾勾结国民党县长驱逐过共产党员。这次右派向党进攻中他又成了“英雄”人物。他在1945年由上饶战地图书出版社出版过一本名叫“文艺、批评与人生”的文艺批评理论集，那是他在国民党第三战区顾祝同的反共大本营的统率之下，宣扬文艺为蒋介石王朝的“最高国策”服务的著作，指挥所谓“东南文艺运动”，大谈其“文艺自由论”，为国民党的“文化建设”大吹大擂，十分卖力地替文化特务张道藩、陈铨的“民族文学运动”作理论上的传道，打着讨论“民族形式”问题的幌子，迷惑青年，混淆是非，说什么“对于陈铨教授所提出来的民族文学运动，应该作为抗战以后民族形式问题的进一步发展看……”等等。
    在“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针提出来以后，许杰写了不少文章，以反教条主义的“英雄”姿态出现。不论在文章里，或是在座谈会上（甚至在对文艺青年的报告会上），他也一次没有放松对文化艺术领域中的党的领导和马克思主义原则的攻击。他说：“扣帽子式的批评的流行，是和文艺界长期以来整风、思想改造，以及批判资产阶级文艺思想、肃清胡风反革命文艺思想等一系列运动分不开的。”他说许多文艺批评是“投机”，许多文艺批评是出自个人主义立场，对文艺理论批评方面的青年作者更是恨之入骨；他悻悻然责问：估计一下你们“吃奶本领”有多大！他把“百家争鸣”的方针，歪曲为马克思列宁主义和一切资产阶级唯心主义“平分秋色”的“两点论”。许杰所以乘着“百家争鸣”的方针如此兴风作浪，其目的是反对马克思主义的正确的文艺批评，以便贩卖他的修正主义的私货。
    目前华东师大正在展开对许杰的斗争，而许杰仍然没有具体地交代问题。许杰面前有两条路，一条是自绝于人民的路，一条是向人民交代清楚，低头认罪的路。
