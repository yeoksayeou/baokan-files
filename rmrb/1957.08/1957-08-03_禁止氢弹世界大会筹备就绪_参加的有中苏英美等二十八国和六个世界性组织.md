Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch from Tokyo: The Third World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament, scheduled to open in Tokyo on August 6, is ready. The agenda and central motions of the conference have been determined. The International Preparatory Center, established on July 22, has actively promoted the preparations for the conference.

During the five days from the opening on August 6 to the 10th, an international preparatory meeting of the world conference will be held, with the participation of approximately 200 delegates from various countries and Japan. The preparatory meeting will be divided into several groups, such as the Peace Activists Conference, the Pacifists and Religious Leaders Conference, the Radioactivity Scientists Conference, the International Law and Disarmament Conference, as well as the Asia-Pacific Regional Conference and the European Regional Conference, for specialized discussions.

The central topics of the plenary session, which will be held from August 12 to 16, are: banning atomic and hydrogen bombs and striving for disarmament; banning the testing of atomic and hydrogen bombs; the peaceful use of atomic energy; the rescue of victims; and easing international tensions. The conference will be divided into nine groups for discussion: workers, youth, women, religion, students, autonomous bodies (local government representatives), farmers and fishermen, business and industry representatives, and victims.

It is expected that approximately 100 foreign delegates from 28 countries, including China, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, the United States, India, Australia, and Ceylon, as well as representatives from six international organizations such as the World Federation of Trade Unions, the Women's International Democratic Federation, and the World Federation of Democratic Youth, will participate in the conference. These include prominent figures such as William Morrow, Australian representative and member of the World Peace Council; Pablo Neruda, Chilean representative and recipient of the Lenin International Peace Prize, Cai Tingkai, Standing Committee member of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace; Mrs. Rameshvari Nehru, Chairwoman of the Indian Committee for Solidarity with Asia; Ivan Andreyevich Kairov, President of the Academy of Pedagogical Sciences of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic of the Soviet Union; and Andrea Andreen, Vice President of the Women's International Democratic Federation.

Five thousand representatives from all over Japan will come to Tokyo to participate in the conference. In the process of selecting representatives in various prefectures and cities, many prefectures and cities have already held prefectural (city) citizen's rallies. In the Miyagi, Aomori, and Oita prefectural citizen's rallies, local government leaders such as prefectural governors and mayors actively assisted in the preparations for the conference and served as chairpersons of the rallies. In the process of selecting representatives, six prefectures, including Kumamoto Prefecture, formally established local councils for the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bombs, with the broad participation of prefectural governors, mayors, prefectural assemblies, city councils, and various groups such as workers, women, farmers, students, and religious groups.

As of the end of June, forty local councils for the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bombs had been established in forty of the forty-six prefectures of Japan. Six other localities are actively preparing to establish similar organizations.

During the same period as the Third World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament is being held in Tokyo, large-scale prefectural (city) citizen's rallies against atomic and hydrogen bombs and for disarmament will also be held in Hokkaido, Osaka, Yamagata, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and other places.

Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch from Hong Kong: Due to the continued deliberate obstruction by the Japanese government on visa issues, the Chinese delegation to the Third World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament is still stranded in Hong Kong and unable to travel.

After arriving in Hong Kong from Guangzhou on July 30, the Chinese delegation held several negotiations with the Japanese Consulate General in Hong Kong on the visa issue, but the Japanese Consulate General has consistently stated that it has not received any notification from the Japanese government and will not issue visas.

    日本全国各地将有五千名代表前来东京参加大会。在各县、市进行的选派代表运动的过程中，已经有许多县、市举行了县（市）民大会。宫城县、青森县、大分县的县民大会，县知事、市长等地方政府的长官都积极地协助了大会的筹备工作，并且担任了大会的主席。熊本县等六个县也在选派代表的过程中，正式成立了有县知事、市长、县议会、市议会和工人、妇女、农民、学生、宗教等各种团体广泛参加的禁止原子弹氢弹地方协议会。
    截至6月底止，日本全国四十六个都、道、府、县中，已经成立了四十个禁止原子弹氢弹地方协议会。还有六个地方正在积极筹备成立同样的组织。

    新华社香港2日电　由于日本政府在签证问题上继续故意留难，参加第三届禁止原子弹、氢弹和争取裁军世界大会的中国代表团，迄今还滞留在香港未能成行。
    中国代表团在7月30日从广州到香港后，曾和日本驻香港总领事馆就签证问题进行了数次交涉，但日本总领事馆一直表示没有接到日本政府的通知，不发签证。
