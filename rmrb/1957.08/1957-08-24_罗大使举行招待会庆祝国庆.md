Xinhua News Agency, August 23rd: Romanian Ambassador to China, Mr. Chivu Stoica, held a reception in Beijing this afternoon to celebrate the 13th anniversary of the National Day of the Romanian People's Republic.

　　Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen attended the reception.

　　Premier Zhou Enlai spoke at the reception, extending warm fraternal congratulations to the government and people of the Romanian People's Republic on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people.

　　Premier Zhou said that over the past thirteen years, under the leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party and the government, the Romanian people have achieved great successes in all aspects of socialist construction. With the development of the economy, the material and cultural living standards of the Romanian people have also been gradually improved. At the same time, Romania's international standing is also constantly rising. Romania has made steadfast efforts to strengthen the unity of socialist countries and safeguard world peace, and has made significant contributions.

　　Premier Zhou said that in recent years, the friendly cooperative relations between China and Romania in the political, economic, and cultural fields have been developing and deepening. Not long ago, the mutual visits of parliamentary delegations between China and Romania played a good role in enhancing mutual understanding and fraternal feelings between the two peoples. The continuously developing fraternal friendship between our two countries is greatly conducive to enhancing the great unity of the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union and safeguarding the noble cause of world peace.

　　Premier Zhou concluded by wishing the Romanian people new and greater achievements in the struggle to build socialism and defend world peace.

　　Ambassador Chivu Stoica spoke at the beginning of the reception, saying: August 23, 1944, in the turbulent history of the Romanian people, not only marked the liberation from the shackles of Hitler's fascism but also marked the beginning of a tremendous political, social, and cultural transformation in Romania. Under the leadership of the working class headed by the Romanian Workers' Party, the Romanian people began to build a new life in which no one exploits another and the working people become the owners of the wealth of the country. For thirteen years since liberation, Romania has transformed from a semi-colonial, backward agricultural country into a country with an advanced political and economic system and a fully developed industry and agriculture. In this great peaceful construction work, the Romanian people need peace and are selflessly fighting to defend world peace and promote friendship among peoples of all countries. The Romanian People's Republic pursues a policy of cooperation and promotion of friendship with all other countries, regardless of their socio-political systems, on the basis of mutual respect for independence and national sovereignty; it pursues a policy of constantly consolidating the unbreakable unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and People's China, and developing political, economic, and cultural relations with countries in Asia and Africa and around the world.

　　In the middle of the reception, the hosts and guests repeatedly toasted to the victory of the cause of world peace, to the great unity of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, to the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Romanian peoples, and to the health of the leaders of the two countries' parties and governments. Also present at the reception were people from all walks of life in China and diplomatic envoys, heads of economic delegations, and diplomatic officials from various countries stationed in China.

　　罗大使举行招待会庆祝国庆
    新华社23日讯　罗马尼亚驻中国大使乔洛尤今天下午在北京举行招待会，庆祝罗马尼亚人民共和国国庆十三周年。
    周恩来总理、贺龙副总理和彭真副委员长出席了招待会。
    周恩来总理在招待会上讲话，他代表中国政府和中国人民向罗马尼亚人民共和国政府和人民表示热烈的兄弟的祝贺。
    周总理说，十三年来，罗马尼亚人民在罗马尼亚工人党和政府的领导下，在社会主义建设的各个方面都取得了巨大的成就。随着经济的发展，罗马尼亚人民的物质和文化生活水平也得到了逐步改善。同时，罗马尼亚的国际地位也在不断提高。罗马尼亚对加强社会主义阵营各国的团结和维护世界和平的事业进行了坚定不移的努力，并且作出了重大的贡献。
    周总理说，近年来，中罗两国在政治、经济和文化方面的友好合作关系正在日益发展和深入。不久以前，中罗两国议会代表团的相互访问，对于增进两国人民的相互了解和兄弟感情起了良好的作用。我们两国的这种不断发展着的兄弟友谊，大大有利于增进以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭的伟大团结和维护世界和平的崇高事业。
    周总理最后预祝罗马尼亚人民在建设社会主义和保卫世界和平的斗争中，获得新的更大的成就。
    乔洛尤大使在招待会开始时讲话，他说：1944年8月23日在罗马尼亚人民动荡的历史中，不仅标志出从希特勒法西斯桎梏下的解放，而且也标志出罗马尼亚在政治上、社会上和文化上的巨大变革的开端。在以罗马尼亚工人党为首的工人阶级的领导下，罗马尼亚人民开始建设没有人剥削人和劳动人民成为国家财富的所有者的新生活。解放十三年来，罗马尼亚已经从一个半殖民地的、落后的农业国家变成了一个拥有先进的政治经济制度和充分发展的工农业的国家。在这一巨大的和平建设工作中，罗马尼亚人民需要和平，并为保卫世界和平、为促进各国人民之间的友谊进行忘我的斗争。罗马尼亚人民共和国执行一种与其他所有国家，不论它们的社会政治制度如何，在互相尊重独立和民族主权的基础上进行合作和促进友谊的政策；执行一种不断巩固以苏联和人民中国为首的社会主义阵营各国牢不可破的团结，并发展与亚非两洲各国以及世界各国的政治、经济和文化关系的政策。
    招待会进行中间，宾主一再为世界和平事业的胜利，为以苏联为首的社会主义各国的伟大团结，为中罗两国人民牢不可破的兄弟友谊和两国党和政府领导人的健康干杯。出席招待会的，还有中国各方面的人士和各国驻中国的使节、经济代表团团长和外交官员。
