    汉德逊仆仆于中东之途
　　美国加紧进行侵叙活动
　　企图纠集土伊等国策划新阴谋
    本报综合报道　据新华社伊斯坦布尔消息：负责中东事务的美国副国务卿帮办汉德逊在伊斯坦布尔进行了紧张的活动。在8月24日到26日期间，他同土耳其总理曼德列斯举行了三次会谈，并且分别同约旦国王侯赛因和伊拉克国王费萨尔就叙利亚局势进行了会谈。
    据大马士革消息　“光明报”8月26日发表社论，评论汉德逊在中东的访问说，汉德逊现在是负责中东事务的副国务卿帮办，因此，在中东所组织的一切罪行和阴谋的背后，特别是在反对叙利亚和埃及两国的阴谋的背后都有他的份。“光明报”指出：汉德逊企图继续同背信弃义的阿拉伯统治者联系，召集反颠覆委员会会议来组织他反对叙利亚的新阴谋。
    “灯塔报”26日说：尽管美国纠集一些罪恶国家来推行自己的阴谋（汉德逊这次到中东来就是为此目的），叙利亚一定能粉碎美国所采取的一切反对叙利亚的步骤和措施。
    据塔斯社德黑兰消息：“知识报”报道，一个由九个人组成的美国代表团在8月25日抵达德黑兰。代表团成员包括美国国务院和国防部的代表。
      “知识报”还报道，美国最高法院法官威廉·道格拉斯最近也已到伊朗活动。
    另据合众社德黑兰消息：美国同四个接受艾森豪威尔主义援助的国家的官员8月26日在伊朗首都举行会议。会议的主要议程是叙利亚局势。
    这四个国家是土耳其、伊朗、巴基斯坦和沙特阿拉伯。
    另据贝鲁特消息：伊拉克代理外交大臣达弗塔里和约旦宫廷总管塔尔霍尼在8月26日同一天分别到达贝鲁特，进行他们所谓的“私人访问”。
