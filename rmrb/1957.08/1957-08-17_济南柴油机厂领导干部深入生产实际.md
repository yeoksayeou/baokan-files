Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, August 15th: The state-owned Jinan Diesel Engine Factory has implemented the spirit of the rectification campaign to improve its leadership style, and has achieved initial results. Of the 945 opinions raised by the factory's employees since the start of the blooming and contending, 242 have now been resolved.

The factory's leadership is doing a better job of going deep into production practice than in the past. For example, one of the key quality factors in the factory, aluminum pistons, had a high rejection rate in the past due to unresolved porosity problems. In July, the technical director personally went deep to understand the situation, held symposiums with workshop leaders, workers, and technical personnel from the forging and metallurgy department. After repeated research and experiments, and learning from the experience of other places, the long-standing problem was finally solved, reducing the rejection rate of aluminum pistons from 10%-20% to 4%. The Party branch secretary and workshop director of the assembly workshop also personally installed safety equipment and repaired cranes for the workers. Regarding the issue of employee wages, the problem of senior workers doing low-level jobs with salary differences has been resolved; unreasonable aspects of the treatment of demobilized and transferred military personnel within the factory have also been adjusted. In addition, in order to make temporary quotas practical and reasonable, and to give play to the enthusiasm of the workshops, the factory leadership decided to hand over the right to revise temporary quotas to the workshops.

Due to the improvement of the leadership style, the production enthusiasm of the employees has been stimulated. The factory's total production value in the second quarter completed 107% of the plan, and in July, all production targets were overfulfilled across the board.

    济南柴油机厂领导干部深入生产实际
    新华社济南15日电  国营济南柴油机厂贯彻整风精神改进领导作风，已经取得初步效果。这个厂的职工群众，鸣放以来提出的九百四十五条意见，目前已经解决了二百四十二条。
    这个厂的领导在深入生产实际方面，比过去作得好。如厂内重大质量关键之一铝活塞，过去因为气孔问题没有解决，废品率很高。7月间，技术厂长亲自深入了解情况，召开了车间领导、工人和锻冶科技术人员座谈会，经过多次研究和试验，并学习了外地经验，终于解决了长期未能解决的问题，使铝活塞的废品率由10％——20％降低到4％。装配车间党支部书记和车间主任还亲自动手给工人安装安全设备和修理吊车。在职工工资问题上，已解决了高级工人干低级活的补差问题；对厂内复员转业军人待遇上的不合理部分也作了调整。此外，为了使临时定额切实合理，并发挥车间的积极性，厂的领导确定将临时定额的修订权交给车间。
    由于领导作风的改进，激发了职工的生产热情。这个厂第二季度的生产总值完成计划的107％，7月份全面超额完成了各项生产指标。
