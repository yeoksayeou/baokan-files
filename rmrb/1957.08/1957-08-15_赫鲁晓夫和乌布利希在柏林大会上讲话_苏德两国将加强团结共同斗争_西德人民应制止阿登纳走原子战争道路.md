Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 13th: According to TASS, the working people of Berlin held a grand rally in Marx-Engels Square in Berlin on August 13 to welcome the Soviet Party and Government delegation's visit to the German Democratic Republic. Men, women, and children held flowers and small flags, and the square was filled with jubilant scenes.

　　Khrushchev and Ulbricht spoke successively. Khrushchev said that the most favorable conditions now exist for further consolidating and developing the socialist relations, comradely cooperation, and joint struggle for consolidating international peace and security between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic.

　　Khrushchev said that the growth and consolidation of the young socialist country, the German Democratic Republic, in the center of Europe has world-historical significance.

　　Referring to the enemies who are hostile to Soviet-German cooperation and attempt to sow seeds of discord between the two countries, Khrushchev said that the Soviet Party and Government delegation fully agrees with the policies implemented by the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and its leadership core headed by Comrade Ulbricht. We have full mutual understanding with the government of the German Democratic Republic headed by Comrade Grotewohl.

　　When mentioning the Soviet Union's position on the German unification issue, Khrushchev said that we hope to see Germany unified into a democratic country that pursues a policy of peace and friendship with all countries. Khrushchev pointed out that, regrettably, the West German rulers headed by Adenauer have adopted a completely different stance. The Adenauer government's policy does not stem from safeguarding peace, but from satisfying militarist and revanchist desires. This policy harbors serious consequences for which the German people will be the first to pay the price.

　　Khrushchev emphasized that there is only one realistic path to restoring German unity, and that is the path of negotiation and consultation between the two Germanies.

　　Khrushchev then spoke about the Soviet Union's relations with West Germany. He said that the West German ruling circles have not only failed to take any steps aimed at improving relations with the Soviet Union, but on the contrary, are trying their best to complicate these relations.

　　Khrushchev then pointed out that the imperialists attempted to seize the fruits of the laboring people in the past, and will continue to attempt to seize the fruits of the laboring people in the future. Therefore, we should strengthen international solidarity, strengthen the unity of the socialist camp countries, and strengthen the strength of socialist countries, including armed forces, to defend our fruits. If we do not do this, we will be committing a crime.

　　Ulbricht then spoke at the meeting. He said that this visit by the delegation of the Communist Party and Government of the Soviet Union is taking place at a time when a certain turning point is occurring in the development of Germany. This new turning point is that the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the National Front of Democratic Germany, the People's Chamber, and the Government of the German Democratic Republic have raised high the banner of striving for the national revival of Germany. The visit of the Soviet delegation and Khrushchev's assessment that the policies implemented by the Socialist Unity Party of Germany were and are the only realistic and correct policies have inspired the residents of the German Democratic Republic to create even greater achievements for the great socialist construction cause.

　　Ulbricht pointed out that the German Democratic Republic has put forward the shortest path to German unification, and negotiations on the issue of establishing a German Confederation can begin immediately after the West German Bundestag election. However, Adenauer's reply to this statement was: the Bonn government will not issue any proposals on unification at this time. In fact, this government does not have any program for unification.

　　Ulbricht said that Adenauer has temporarily deceived many West German citizens. However, millions of people in West Germany have already seen through all of this. They are pondering the prospect of atomic war put forward by Adenauer. Ulbricht said that the residents of West Germany should understand that if they do not organize the necessary forces to force the West German militarists and the Adenauer government not to take this path that leads to destruction but to take the path of peace, then they will have to pay a heavy price for this policy.

　　Ulbricht said: We will strive to unite the actions of the German working class, because this is the condition for the victory of our cause of peace, democracy, and socialist justice.

    赫鲁晓夫和乌布利希在柏林大会上讲话
    苏德两国将加强团结共同斗争
    西德人民应制止阿登纳走原子战争道路
    据新华社14日讯　据塔斯社柏林13日讯：柏林市劳动人民为苏联党和政府代表团的访问民主德国8月13日在柏林马克思—恩格斯广场举行了盛大集会。男男女女和孩子们手里都拿着鲜花和小旗，广场上是一片欢腾的景象。
    赫鲁晓夫和乌布利希先后讲了话。赫鲁晓夫说：现在具有最有利的条件来进一步巩固和发展苏联和德意志民主共和国的社会主义关系、同志合作以及为巩固国际和平与安全的共同斗争。
    赫鲁晓夫说，在欧洲中部年轻的社会主义国家德意志民主共和国的壮大和巩固具有世界历史意义。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到仇视苏德两国合作的敌人企图在两国之间散布纠纷的种子时说，苏联党和政府代表团完全同意德国统一社会党及以乌布利希同志为首的领导核心所执行的政策。我们同以格罗提渥同志为首的德意志民主共和国政府之间有着充分的互相谅解。
    赫鲁晓夫在提到苏联对德国统一问题的立场的时候说，我们希望能够看见德国统一成一个奉行和平和同一切国家友好的政策的民主国家。赫鲁晓夫指出，遗憾的是，以阿登纳为首的西德执政者却采取了完全不同的立场。阿登纳政府的政策不是出自维护和平的利益，而是为了满足军国主义和复仇主义的愿望。这种政策孕育着德国人民首先为之付出代价的严重后果。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，恢复德国统一的现实道路只有一条，这就是两个德国进行谈判和协商的道路。
    赫鲁晓夫接着谈到苏联同西德的关系。他说，西德统治集团方面不仅没有采取任何目的在于改善同苏联的关系的步骤，而且相反地，在竭力使这种关系复杂化。
    赫鲁晓夫接着指出，帝国主义者过去企图侵占劳动人民的果实，今后也将企图侵占劳动人民的果实，因此，我们应当加强国际团结，加强社会主义阵营国家的团结，加强社会主义国家的力量，包括武装力量在内，来捍卫自己的果实。如果不是这样，我们就会犯罪。
    乌布利希接着在大会上讲话。他说，苏联共产党和政府代表团这次访问正是在德国发展方面发生某种转折的时候。这种新的转折是：德国统一社会党、民主德国全国阵线、人民议院和德意志民主共和国政府高高举起了争取德国民族复兴的旗帜。苏联代表团的访问以及赫鲁晓夫关于德国统一社会党所实行的政策在过去和现在都是唯一现实和正确的政策的估价，鼓舞了德意志民主共和国居民为伟大的社会主义建设事业创造更大的功绩。
    乌布利希指出，德意志民主共和国提出了一条走向德国统一的最短的道路，关于建立德意志邦联（新华社编者注：前误为联邦）的问题的谈判可以在西德联邦议院选举结束以后立即开始。而阿登纳对这项声明的答复是：目前波恩政府不发表有关统一的任何建议。实际上，这个政府没有任何关于统一的纲领。
    乌布利希说，阿登纳暂时欺骗了许多西德公民。但是，西德的千百万人已经看破了这一切。他们正在为阿登纳所提出的原子战争的前景而深思。乌布利希说，应该让西德的居民懂得，如果他们不组织必要的力量来迫使西德军国主义者和阿登纳政府不走这种招致灭亡的道路而走和平的道路，那末他们将不得不为这种政策付出惨重的代价。
    乌布利希说：我们将努力使德国工人阶级的行动团结一致，因为这是我们的和平、民主和社会主义的正义事业胜利的条件。
