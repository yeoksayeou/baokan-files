Xinhua News Agency, August 18th: Comrade Kang Sheng said yesterday at the report meeting for Marxist-Leninist teachers in Beijing: How to teach Marxist-Leninist political courses and conduct socialist ideological education in universities this second half of the year should first be understood from the perspective of the current political situation.

Comrade Kang Sheng was invited by the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China to give a report to all Marxist-Leninist teachers and Party propaganda workers in schools, government organizations, the military, and other units in the Beijing area. More than 5,600 people attended the report.

Comrade Kang Sheng first pointed out: Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, a teaching force of approximately 15,000 people dedicated to teaching Marxism-Leninism has been established nationwide. Building such a force in just over seven years is a major event in the theoretical construction of socialism in our country. This force has played an active role in Marxist-Leninist education and has achieved many successes. These successes are primary, while shortcomings are secondary. This force teaches Marxist-Leninist political courses and opposes bourgeois sociology, political science, economics, and law. Taking advantage of the Party's rectification campaign, bourgeois right-wing elements have unleashed all sorts of poisonous arrows to attack Marxist-Leninist political courses. They shamelessly and ignorantly oppose Marxism-Leninism in the name of opposing dogmatism. Comrade Kang Sheng said that bourgeois right-wing elements call Party members and non-Party teachers who stand on the Marxist-Leninist position "defenders of the faith." This is not our shame but our glory; we are defending the way of Marxism-Leninism, the way of the Communist Party.

Comrade Kang Sheng said that we have established such a force to conduct Marxist-Leninist political courses, but our force is not strong enough, its quality is not high enough, and its lineup is not aligned enough. Specifically, this force is in three states: First, some people are relatively familiar with Marxism-Leninism and have begun to establish a proletarian worldview, but this number is small. Second, a few people lecture on Marxism-Leninism in class and write articles on Marxism-Leninism, but they do so to eat and earn money. Marxism-Leninism has no relationship with them, and they are, in fact, opposed to Marxism-Leninism. During the period of "blooming and contending," some of them became bourgeois right-wing elements. Third, the vast majority are willing to learn Marxism-Leninism and have learned some, but they are not very familiar with it. Their old worldview has not been removed, or has not been completely removed, and a new worldview has not been established, or has not been completely established. Some people only want to study Marxism-Leninism in the study room and are unwilling to approach the workers and peasants, and have no close contact with the workers and peasants. They are still in an intermediate transitional state. Comrade Kang Sheng said that teachers of Marxist-Leninist education must have a firm Marxist-Leninist stance and a proletarian worldview. Establishing a Marxist-Leninist worldview is not easy and cannot be done overnight. Therefore, our Marxist-Leninist teachers should continuously transform themselves. He said that neglecting to transform oneself is very dangerous. It is difficult to imagine that a teacher who educates people to learn Marxism-Leninism and establish a proletarian worldview would hold an old bourgeois worldview. It is difficult for such a person to assume this task.

Comrade Kang Sheng then spoke about how to conduct Marxist-Leninist political courses and socialist ideological education in universities this second half of the year. He said that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the people of the whole country are rebuffing the frenzied attacks of bourgeois right-wing elements and launching a nationwide debate. This is a socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. When we discuss Marxist-Leninist political courses and socialist ideological education in universities this second half of the year, we should proceed from the current class struggle, revolutionary movement, Party tasks, and specific educational objects to carry out our work. The universities across the nation have experienced a period of intense struggle against right-wing elements. Currently, in Beijing universities, the large-scale mass struggle against right-wing elements has generally come to an end, but the rectification campaign and the struggle against right-wing elements have not yet ended, and the depth and breadth of the struggle against right-wing elements in various schools are also uneven. In the future, in addition to continuing to solve problems that have not yet been resolved, it is necessary to systematically and deeply conduct rectification and socialist ideological education. Therefore, after discussions among the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Ministry of Higher Education, and other parties, it was unanimously agreed that in addition to continuing to use all extracurricular methods and conduct political education through various majors, such education must also be systematically conducted within the curriculum. An important method is to change the content and methods of the original political courses, and use the time of political courses, or even more time, to universally offer a course on "Socialist Ideological Education" in all grades of national universities.

Comrade Kang Sheng pointed out that the nature of this course is class education in the socialist revolution movement, and it cannot be treated as an ordinary course. This is a rectification and socialist education course, and it is an integral part of the nationwide debate.

Comrade Kang Sheng said that it is right to pay attention to the systematicness and completeness of Marxist-Leninist political courses, but it is wrong to prepare lessons in isolation from the current class struggle, revolutionary movement, Party tasks, and specific educational objects. The educational policy of closely integrating Marxist-Leninist theory and practice should be paid attention to at all times, and especially when conducting Marxist-Leninist political courses this second half of the year.

After Comrade Kang Sheng talked about the documents and study methods for Marxist-Leninist political courses, he pointed out that the entire teaching and learning process is a process of using proletarian thought to criticize bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thought, and using the Marxist-Leninist stand, viewpoint, and method to overcome non-Marxist-Leninist stand, viewpoint, and method. The key issue in the teaching process of this course is to present all kinds of viewpoints, thoughts, speeches, and the various accurate facts of the right-wing elements' anti-Party and anti-socialist actions in the discussion, and to fully reason, argue, refute, and let go of contention. If this is not done, this course cannot be taught well. He said that except for a few right-wing elements, the policy of unity-criticism-unity should be implemented for students and teachers with wrong ideas in the debate, and the method of gentle breeze and drizzle and persuasion and education should be used to truly solve problems ideologically.

Comrade Kang Sheng, when talking about some issues in the preparation work for Marxist-Leninist political courses in universities this second half of the year, said that first of all, teachers should recognize the necessity and importance of this political course, and clarify and unify their thinking ideologically. He said, "We believe that after a period of intense struggle against right-wing elements, the vast majority of teachers can understand the necessity and importance of this course. But it is also possible that some teachers, accustomed to the old teaching methods, will not be able to change their ways for a while. They are accustomed to conducting Marxist-Leninist education in the classroom and in books, and will not or will not fully conduct Marxist-Leninist education in class struggle, so they feel unsure. This is completely understandable. For these comrades, it is necessary to make their thinking adapt to the new environment and new things, so that they understand that they cannot fully learn Marxism-Leninism only in the classroom and in books. They should be encouraged to actively participate in this battle and learn to conduct Marxist-Leninist education in class struggle."

Comrade Kang Sheng pointed out that there is also an ideological obstacle to overcome, that is, some people teach Marxist-Leninist political courses in the classroom, but they treat Marxism-Leninism from the standpoint of bourgeois individualism. They regard Marxism-Leninism as a ladder for personal gain. They want to be famous and profitable "theoretical workers" and are unwilling to be political propagandists who serve the proletariat and socialism. They teach Marxism-Leninism in their mouths, but they think of bourgeois individualism in their hearts. Comrade Kang Sheng pointed out that we have seen in the rectification campaign and the struggle against right-wing elements that, in addition to a few right-wing elements who actively oppose Marxism-Leninism, there are two positions and two attitudes towards Marxism-Leninism within the ranks of people's teachers. One is to treat Marxism-Leninism from the standpoint of bourgeois individualism. This attitude requires Marxism-Leninism to serve them personally, which is a wrong attitude; the other is to treat Marxism-Leninism from the standpoint of the proletariat. Their purpose is to serve the proletariat and socialism, which is a correct attitude. In our work of socialist ideological education, we should oppose incorrect attitudes and vigorously promote correct attitudes, and regard Marxism-Leninism as a guide to action, a weapon for class struggle, and a weapon for transforming ourselves. Only comrades with such a position and viewpoint are true Marxists-Leninists.

When talking about preparatory work, Comrade Kang Sheng also pointed out that teachers should first study, study basic and reference documents, study the experience in the struggle against right-wing elements, and also learn by actively participating in the struggle against right-wing elements. He said that in the preparatory work, it is also necessary to rectify the ranks of teachers, strengthen and supplement new forces, improve the awareness of the original teachers, so that they are good at making friends with workers and peasants, participate in physical labor, and are determined to be proletarian intellectuals and become good friends of the workers and peasants.

Comrade Kang Sheng finally pointed out that the most important link in this work is to, under the personal leadership of the local Party committees and the Party committees of various universities, make socialist ideological education work a central task of leadership work, mobilize all Party member and Youth League member teachers, and unite all non-Party teachers to carry it out together. He believes that as long as the Party committees actively lead all Party member teachers and non-Party teachers, and the teachers unite around the Party and act as Party workers and courageous fighters in the class struggle, this work can be done well.

    今年下半年在全国高等学校各年级中
    开设社会主义思想教育课程
    从当前政治形势出发进行整风和社会主义教育
    康生同志向北京市马列主义教师作报告
    新华社18日讯　康生同志昨天在北京市马列主义教师报告会上说：今年下半年高等学校怎样教授马列主义政治课，怎样进行社会主义思想教育，首先要从当前政治形势出发，来理解这个问题。
    康生同志是应中共北京市委宣传部的邀请，向北京地区的学校、机关、军队等单位的全体马列主义教师与党的宣传工作人员做报告的。听报告的有五千六百多人。
    康生同志首先指出：在中国共产党的领导之下，全国已有一支大约一万五千人左右的教授马列主义的教育队伍，在七年多的时间里建立起这样一支队伍，是我国社会主义理论建设中的一件大事。这支队伍在马列主义教育工作中，起了积极的作用，获得了很多的成绩。这些成绩是主要的，虽然还有缺点，这是次要的。这支队伍教的是马列主义政治课，反对的是资产阶级的社会学、政治学、经济学、法学。资产阶级右派分子在利用党进行整风的机会，就放出一切毒箭，向马列主义政治课进攻，他们无耻地无知地在反对教条主义的名义下来反对马列主义。康生同志说，资产阶级右派分子把站在马列主义立场上的党员和非党员教师，说成是“卫道者”，这不是我们的耻辱，而是我们的光荣，我们是保卫马列主义之道，保卫共产党之道。
    康生同志说，我们已建立起这样一支队伍，来进行马列主义的政治课，但是我们的队伍还不够强大，质量不够高，阵容不够整齐。具体分析起来这支队伍有三种状态：一种是比较熟悉马列主义，开始建立了无产阶级的世界观，这种人还不多。第二种是有少数人虽在课堂上讲马列主义，写马列主义的文章，但是他们讲课、写文章，是为了吃饭、赚钱，马列主义和他们本身没有关系，甚至他们实际上是反对马列主义的，在大鸣大放中，有些人变成了资产阶级右派分子。第三种，是绝大多数人，他们愿意学习马列主义，而且学了一些，但是不很熟悉；他们自己的旧的世界观没有去掉，或者没有完全去掉，新的世界观没有建立，或者还没有完全建立；有些人只愿在书房里研究马列主义，不愿意接近工农群众，和工农群众没有密切联系，他们还处在中间过渡的状态。康生同志说，马列主义教育工作的教师，必须有坚定的马列主义立场和无产阶级世界观。建立马列主义世界观是不容易的，不是一时可以办到的，因此我们的马列主义教师应当不断地改造自己。他说，忽视改造自己是很危险的。很难设想，一个教育人民学习马列主义和建立无产阶级世界观的教师，却抱有旧的资产阶级世界观。这样的人是很难担当这个任务的。
    康生同志接着讲了今年下半年高等学校怎样进行马列主义政治课，怎样进行社会主义思想教育问题。他说，全国人民正在中国共产党的领导下，反击资产阶级右派分子的猖狂进攻，展开全民性的大辩论，这是一场政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义革命。我们讨论下半年高等学校的马列主义政治课、社会主义思想教育，应当从当前的阶级斗争、革命运动、党的任务和具体的教育对象出发，来进行我们的工作。全国高等学校经过了一段激烈的反击右派斗争。目前在北京市的高等学校里，一般的说，大规模的反击右派的群众斗争的高潮已告一段落，但是整风和反右派斗争尚未结束，各学校反右派斗争的深度和广度也是不平衡的。今后除了继续解决尚未解决的问题外，需要系统地深入地进行整风和社会主义的思想教育。因此，今年下半年各高等学校的政治思想教育，经过中共中央宣传部、高等教育部等各方面的座谈和讨论，一致认为除了继续运用课外一切方法及通过各种专业进行政治教育外，还必须在课程之内有系统地进行这种教育。它的一个重要方法，就是把原有的政治课改变它的内容和方法，利用政治课的时间，或者更多一些时间，在全国高等学校各年级普遍开设“社会主义思想教育”这门课。
    康生同志指出：这一种课程的性质，是社会主义革命运动中的阶级教育，不能当作普通课程来进行，这是一个整风和社会主义教育的课程，是全民大辩论的组成部分。
    康生同志说，进行马列主义的政治课，注意它的系统性、完整性是对的，但是脱离当前阶级斗争、革命运动、党的任务和具体的教育对象来进行备课是不对的。马列主义理论和实践密切结合的教育方针是任何时候都要注意的，今年下半年进行马列主义政治课的时候尤其要注意。
    康生同志在讲到了马列主义政治课学习的文件和学习方法后指出：全部教学过程和学习过程，是以无产阶级的思想来批判资产阶级、小资产阶级的思想，是以马列主义的立场、观点、方法，来克服非马列主义的立场、观点、方法的过程。这门课程在教学过程中的关键性问题，是在讨论中要把各种观点、各种思想、言论及右派分子反党反社会主义的各种准确的事实，都摆出来，经过充分说理、争论、反驳，放手争鸣。不这样做，这门课程是教不好的。他说，除了少数右派分子外，在辩论中对有错误思想的学生和教师，应当贯彻团结——批评——团结的方针，应用和风细雨、说服教育的方法，以达到真正从思想上解决问题的目的。
    康生同志在讲到下半年高等学校马列主义政治课的准备工作方面的一些问题时说，首先要使教师们认识这门政治课的必要性和重要意义，在思想上明确起来、统一起来。他说，我们相信：经过了一段激烈的反右派斗争，绝大多数的教师们是能够了解这门课程的必要性和重要意义的。但是也可能有些教师，习惯于过去一套教学方法，一时还转不过来。他们习惯于在课堂上书本上进行马列主义教育，不会或不完全会在阶级斗争中进行马列主义的教育，因而觉得没有把握，这是完全可以理解的。对这些同志，要使他们的思想适应新的环境和新的事物，使他们了解只是在课堂上书本上，是不能完全学会马列主义的。应该使他们积极地投入到这一个战斗中去，学会在阶级斗争中进行马列主义的教育。
    康生同志指出，还有一种思想障碍要克服，这就是某些人虽然也在课堂上教马列主义政治课，但是他们是以资产阶级个人主义的立场来对待马列主义。他们把马列主义作为个人打算的阶梯。他们要想做有名有利的“理论工作者”，不愿去做为无产阶级服务、为社会主义服务的政治宣传员。他们嘴上教的是马列主义，心里想的是资产阶级个人主义。康生同志指出：我们在整风和反右派斗争中看到，教师的队伍除了少数右派分子积极反对马列主义外，在人民教师内部，对待马列主义有两种立场、两种态度，一种是以资产阶级的个人主义立场对待马列主义，这种态度是要求马列主义为他个人服务，这是一种错误的态度；另一种是以无产阶级的立场来对待马列主义，他们的目的是为无产阶级和社会主义服务，这是一种正确的态度。我们在进行社会主义的思想教育工作中，应该反对不正确的态度，大力提倡正确的态度，把马列主义当作行动的指南、阶级斗争的武器，当作改造自己的武器，有这样的立场、观点的同志，才是真正的马列主义者。
    康生同志在讲到准备工作时还指出：教师首先要进行学习，学习基本的和参考的文件，研究反右派斗争中的经验，并且还要在积极参加反右派的斗争中去学习。他说，在准备工作中还要整顿教师的队伍，要加强和补充新的力量，提高原有教师的觉悟，使他们善于同工农群众做朋友，参加体力劳动，下决心做无产阶级的知识分子，成为工农群众的好朋友。
    康生同志最后指出：这个工作最重要的环节，是在各地党委和各高等学校党委的亲自领导下，把社会主义的思想教育工作，作为领导工作的一个中心任务，动员所有党员、团员教师，团结一切非党教师，共同来进行。他相信：只要党委积极领导了所有党员教师和非党员教师；而教师们又团结在党的周围，作一个党的工作人员、阶级斗争中的勇敢战士，这个工作是可以做好的。
