Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 16th - This reporter, Wang Yuzhang, reports: During the twelve years that the United States has occupied South Korea, it has turned South Korea into its colony and military base, causing South Korea's economy to decline and its people to become increasingly impoverished.

For twelve years, industrial and agricultural production in South Korea has been declining. Currently, the total value of industrial production has decreased by half compared to the period of Japanese rule; all industrial products are only equivalent to one-third of the needs of the South Korean people. At the same time, the colonial nature of industry has been continuously deepened due to the large-scale investment of American capital.

South Korea's national industry, mainly composed of small and medium-sized enterprises, is on the verge of bankruptcy. In April of this year, 48% of factories in the Seoul area were shut down. In the Gyeongsangbuk-do area, which accounts for a quarter of the total number of factories in South Korea, 70% of the factories had suspended operations or closed down by June of this year.

In agriculture, South Korea's annual grain output is currently about one-third lower than the average annual output during the period of Japanese rule. South Korea, known as the "granary," is short of six million "seok" of grain this year. In the past twelve years, South Korea's cultivated land area has decreased by more than 599,000 "町步" (one "町步" is approximately equal to 15 Chinese mu).

While South Korea's own industry and agriculture have gone bankrupt, the United States has dumped more and more surplus industrial and agricultural products into South Korea.

The lives of the South Korean people are becoming increasingly impoverished. According to statistics, there are currently 3.6 million unemployed and semi-unemployed people in South Korea. The average wage of workers is not enough to maintain the minimum standard of living. In rural areas, more than one million households ran out of food in May of this year.

    美国蹂躏十二年的恶果
    南朝鲜工业雕敝农村破产
    据新华社平壤16日电  本社记者王玉章报道：美国在占领南朝鲜的十二年间，把南朝鲜变成了它的殖民地和军事基地，使南朝鲜的经济日益衰退，人民日益贫困。
    十二年来，南朝鲜的工农业生产不断下降。目前，工业生产总值已经比日本统治时期下降了一半；全部工业品只相当于南朝鲜人民需要量的三分之一。同时，工业的殖民地性质由于美国资本的大量投入而不断加深。
    南朝鲜的以中小型工业为主的民族工业濒于破产。今年4月，汉城地区的工厂有48％停工。占南朝鲜工厂总数四分之一的庆尚北道地区的工厂，到今年6月有70％停工倒闭。
    在农业方面，南朝鲜粮食的年产量目前比日本统治时期的平均年产量大约降低了三分之一。号称“粮仓”的南朝鲜今年竟缺粮六百万石。十二年来，南朝鲜的耕地面积减少了五十九万九千多町步（一町步约合十五市亩）。
    在南朝鲜本身的工农业遭到破产的同时，美国向南朝鲜倾销了越来越多的剩余工农业产品。
    南朝鲜人民的生活正愈来愈贫困化。据统计，南朝鲜现有失业和半失业者三百六十万人。工人的平均工资不够维持最低的生活。在农村中，今年5月断粮农户达到了一百多万户。
