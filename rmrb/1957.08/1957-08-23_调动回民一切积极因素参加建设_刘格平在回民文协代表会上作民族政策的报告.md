Xinhua News Agency, 22nd. The Chinese Hui People's Cultural Advancement Association held its second representative conference from the 8th to the 22nd. The meeting discussed carrying out socialist ideological education among the Hui people and promoting all positive factors among the Hui people to participate in socialist construction. During the meeting, it also countered the attack of right-wing elements among the Hui people against the Communist Party.

At the meeting, Liu Geping, director of the Chinese Hui People's Cultural Advancement Association, made a report on ethnic policies. After comprehensively elaborating on the development process of the Chinese Hui ethnic group, Liu Geping said that under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Hui people have made great progress in the eight years since liberation. At present, the Wuzhong, Guyuan, and Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefectures have been established in Gansu, the Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture has been established in Xinjiang, and ten Hui Autonomous Counties and more than one hundred Hui Townships have been established throughout the country. Regional autonomy has been implemented in areas with a total Hui population of one million five hundred thousand. The Fourth Session of the National People's Congress has approved the establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, which is equivalent to a provincial level, to further promote the political, economic, and cultural development of the Hui people. This shows that the Hui people have gained the right to be masters of their own affairs.

At present, the agriculture, industry, commerce, and handicrafts of the Hui ethnic group have all undergone socialist transformation. The historical economic characteristics and living habits of the Hui ethnic group have also been taken into consideration during the transformation, so that the Hui people have guarantees in production and life.

In the past, the Hui ethnic group was limited by economic backwardness, and its culture was backward. More than 70% to 80% of the Hui people were illiterate. After liberation, the government allocated special funds for education subsidies to the Hui ethnic group in both concentrated and scattered areas to support the development of culture and education. According to incomplete statistics, there are more than 1,000 special Hui primary schools with more than 300,000 primary school students, and the number of children attending school accounts for more than 60% of school-age children. In general cities, more than 90% of Hui school-age children attend school, which basically solves the problem of Hui children dropping out of school. At present, there are 30 special Hui middle schools in the country, with more than 34,000 middle school students. The number of Hui students in universities and colleges has also increased to more than 3,000.

Liu Geping said that the "poor Hui people" in the past could not even raise their heads, and now they have developed so rapidly in all aspects. This was unimaginable in the old days. Therefore, we must firmly believe in and support the Communist Party, resolutely take the socialist road, strengthen unity with all ethnic groups, and strive to build the socialist cause.

Liu Geping also talked about the relationship between the Hui ethnic group and Islam. He said that "Hui ethnic group" is not equal to "Hui religion." "Hui religion" is another name for the Chinese Hui ethnic group's belief in Islam, and the correct name is still Islam. However, some people think that the saying "Islam is Hui religion" and "Hui religion is Hui ethnic group" is wrong. In the past, the Kuomintang's denial of the "Hui ethnic group" and recognition of "Hui religion" was ulterior motives, and they wanted to use this to eliminate the Hui ethnic group.

Regarding the Hui language issue, Liu Geping said that the Hui and Han ethnic groups have historically used the same language and writing system, which has played a significant role in the development of the Hui ethnic group. However, some people advocate using Arabic as the Hui language, but this view does not conform to the actual situation. Arabic can only be used in religion among the Hui ethnic group and cannot be used as a tool for social life. The Hui ethnic group will have greater development prospects if they use Chinese.

At the meeting, Gan Chunlei, Secretary-General of the Association, made a report on the work of the Chinese Hui People's Cultural Advancement Association in the past four years and opinions on future work. The report requested all representatives to continue to assist the government in carrying out in-depth socialist ideological education among the broad masses of Hui people in accordance with the spirit of Chairman Mao's speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," further strengthen the education of national unity, strengthen the investigation and research of the work of the Hui people, and assist the government and relevant parties in promoting the economic and cultural development of the Hui people.

After repeated study and discussion, the representatives unanimously adopted Liu Geping's report on ethnic policies and Gan Chunlei's work report. The representatives also used the large number of facts of the vigorous political, economic, and cultural development of the Hui people in the past few years to criticize the anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds of Ma Songting, a right-wing element among the Hui people, and drew a clear line with Ma Songting. Ma Songting made two self-criticisms at the meeting, but they were not profound enough. The representatives asked Ma Songting to continue to make confessions after the meeting closed.

The meeting finally adopted a new draft of the Chinese Hui People's Cultural Advancement Association's constitution, re-elected the director, deputy directors, and members, and elected Liu Geping as the director of the Chinese Hui People's Cultural Advancement Association, Wang Xingrang, Wu Hongbin, Ma Teng'ai, Zhao Zhongqi, Bai Shouyi, and Li Weidong as deputy directors, and Ding Zhentu and others as 107 members. The committee also elected Ding Yimin as the secretary-general of the association.

    调动回民一切积极因素参加建设
    刘格平在回民文协代表会上作民族政策的报告
    新华社22日讯　中国回民文化协进会于8日到22日举行了第二届代表会议。会议讨论了在回民中贯彻社会主义的思想教育，推动回民中的一切积极因素参加社会主义建设的问题。会议期间还反击了回族中的右派分子向共产党的进攻。
    会上，中国回民文化协进会主任刘格平作了关于民族政策问题的报告。刘格平全面阐述了中国回族发展过程之后说，解放八年来回族人民在共产党的领导下有了很大发展，目前在甘肃已建立了吴忠、固原、临夏回族自治州，在新疆建立了昌吉回族自治州，全国各地建立了十个回族自治县和一百多个回族乡，全国已有一百五十万回族人口的地区实行了区域自治。为了进一步促进回族人民的政治、经济、文化的发展，全国人民代表大会第四次会议已批准成立相当省一级的宁夏回族自治区。这说明回族人民已获得了当家作主的权利。
    目前回族的农业、工商业和手工业都经过了社会主义改造，在改造中还照顾到回族历史性的经济特点和生活习惯，使回族人民在生产和生活方面都有了保障。
    过去回族因受经济落后的限制，文化落后，回族人民百分之七、八十以上都是文盲。解放后不管在聚居区或散居区，政府对回族拨发了教育补助专款，扶持文化教育的发展。据不完全的统计，全国专设的回族小学有一千多所、小学生达三十多万人，入学儿童占学龄儿童的60％多。一般城市的回族学龄儿童入学的达90％以上，基本上解决了回族儿童的失学现象。现在全国专设的回族中学有三十所，中学生达到三万四千多人。高等学校的回族学生也增加到三千多人。
    刘格平说，过去的“穷回回”连头也抬不起来，现在各方面都有了这样快的发展，这在旧时代是想像不到的，因此我们要坚决相信和拥护共产党，坚决走社会主义的道路，加强和各民族的团结，为建设社会主义事业而奋斗。
    刘格平并谈到回族与伊斯兰教的关系问题，他说，“回族”并不等于“回教”，“回教”是中国回族信仰伊斯兰教的别称，正确的名称仍为伊斯兰教。但有些人认为“伊斯兰教即是回教”，“回教即回族”的说法是错误的。过去国民党否认“回族”而承认“回教”的说法是别有用意的，他们想借此消灭回族。
    关于回族文字问题，刘格平说，回族和汉族在历史上使用同一语言和文字，这对回族的发展起了很大作用，但有些人主张用阿拉伯文作为回族文字，这种主张是不符合现实情况的。阿拉伯文在回族中只能在宗教上使用，不能作为社会生活的工具，回族使用汉文汉语，才会有更大的发展前途。
    会上，该会秘书长甘春雷作了中国回民文化协进会四年来的工作情况和今后工作意见的报告，报告中要求各位代表根据毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”讲演的精神，继续协助政府在广大回民群众中深入进行社会主义的思想教育，进一步加强民族团结的教育，加强回民工作情况的调查研究工作，协助政府和有关方面促进回民经济、文化的发展。
    会上，各位代表经过反复地研究和讨论之后，一致通过了刘格平关于民族政策问题的报告和甘春雷的工作报告。代表们并用回族人民在这几年来的政治、经济、文化的蓬勃发展的大量事实，批判了回族中的右派分子马松亭的反党、反社会主义的言行，和马松亭划清了界限。马松亭在会上作了两次检讨，但极不深刻，代表们要马松亭在会议闭幕以后继续作交代。
    会议最后通过了中国回民文化协进会新的简章草案，改选了主任、副主任和委员，选出刘格平为中国回民文化协进会主任，王兴让、吴鸿宾、马腾霭、赵钟奇、白寿彝、李微冬为副主任，丁振徒等一百零七人为委员。委员会并推选丁毅民为该会秘书长。
