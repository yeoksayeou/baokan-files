Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd. The Japanese Foreign Ministry issued a statement today, shirking the responsibility of the Japanese government in forcing China to halt commodity exhibitions in Nagoya and Fukuoka, and continued to insist that Chinese staff of the Chinese commodity exhibition must have their fingerprints taken.

It is precisely because of this unreasonable attitude of the Japanese government that the preparation work for the exhibition has been unable to proceed, and the Chinese side recently announced a temporary shelving of the plan to hold the exhibition in Japan.

In a statement issued today, Kondo Shinichi, director of the Public Information and Cultural Affairs Bureau of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, also made empty talk about the Japanese government's "consistent hope for the development" of Sino-Japanese trade. He tried his best to deny that the Japanese government had "any intention of obstructing" the exhibition, and described the Japanese government's obstruction of the exhibition by requiring Chinese personnel to have their fingerprints taken as "obeying Japanese national law" and as "a matter of course."

In the year before last, when the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet had not yet come to power, China held commodity exhibitions in Tokyo and Osaka, and the Chinese personnel of the exhibitions did not have their fingerprints taken.

On the same day, leading cadres of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party of Japan, such as Kawashima Shojiro, Ikeda Masanosuke, and Uda Koichi, held a meeting in Tokyo and decided not to immediately send representatives of the Liberal Democratic Party to China for the time being, but to see how things develop in the future. However, they also decided that the Liberal Democratic Party should be "responsible for promoting" trade with China.

The Japanese government and the Liberal Democratic Party had decided on July 27 to send Ikeda Masanosuke to China to discuss Sino-Japanese trade issues.

### 我商品展览会无法进行筹备工作  日本政府竟想推卸责任

    我商品展览会无法进行筹备工作
    日本政府竟想推卸责任
    新华社3日讯　东京消息：日本外务省今天发表声明，推卸日本政府迫使中国停止在日本名古屋和福冈举行商品展览会的责任，并且继续坚持要中国商品展览会的中国工作人员按指印的态度。
    正是由于日本政府的这种无理态度，已经使得展览会的筹备工作无法进行，中国方面才在最近宣布暂时搁置在日本举行展览会的计划。
    日本外务省情报文化局长近藤晋一在今天发表的谈话中，还在空谈日本政府对中日贸易“一贯地期望它有所发展”。他竭力否认日本政府对展览会有“任何加以阻挠的企图”，并且把日本政府用要中国人员按指印的办法阻挠展览会的行为说成是“遵守日本的国法”，说成是“理所当然的”。
    在前年，那时岸信介内阁还没有上台，中国曾经在日本的东京和大阪举行过商品展览会，展览会的中国人员并没有按指印。
    同一天，日本执政的自由民主党的川岛正次郎、池田正之辅、宇田耕一等领导干部在东京举行了会议，决定目前不立刻派自由民主党的代表到中国，而要看看今后的发展。但是，他们又决定要由自由民主党“负责促进”对中国的贸易。
    日本政府和自由民主党曾经在7月27日决定派遣池田正之辅到中国商谈有关中日贸易的问题。
