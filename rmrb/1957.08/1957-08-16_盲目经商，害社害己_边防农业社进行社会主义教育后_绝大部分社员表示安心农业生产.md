Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 15th: After the Border Defense Agricultural Cooperative in Yunxiao County, Fujian Province, conducted socialist education among its members, many members who had abandoned agriculture for commerce resolved not to take the capitalist road and returned to the cooperative to focus on agricultural production.

Tang Tianyi, a member of the Border Defense Cooperative, did not like agricultural labor and often engaged in petty trading. Some members, incited by Tang Tianyi, followed him in abandoning farming to become peddlers and engage in commercial speculation. Because the Border Defense Cooperative did not promptly criticize this capitalist tendency to abandon agriculture for commerce, since June, more than one hundred members of the cooperative participated in this commercial activity. More than eighty of them rushed to purchase sweet potato threads in the countryside and transported them to the Yunxiao County city black market for sale; more than twenty people ran to the neighboring Dongshan County to traffic fish; and some people specialized in the firewood trade. The large number of people engaged in commercial activities caused a severe shortage of labor in the cooperative, seriously affecting agricultural production. Even during the busy summer harvest, many members left ripe crops unharvested and continued to engage in commerce.

In light of this situation, the Communist Party branch of Liyu Township recently conducted socialist education among the members in conjunction with the anti-Rightist struggle propaganda, and pointed out the harm of engaging in speculative trading to the country, the agricultural cooperative, and themselves. It called on the members to draw a clear line between themselves and merchants, work hard to produce grain and other crops, and jointly build socialism. Subsequently, the Party branch also used various meetings to organize the members to debate whether “abandoning agriculture for commerce” was good or not. At the meeting, members of the Zhao Hu production team who were engaged in commercial activities used their own facts to demonstrate the serious harm of engaging in commerce. This production team had a total of eleven laborers, but six of them went into business. No one managed the team's agricultural production, and summer crops were reduced, amounting to a loss of about 400 yuan. Because of the reduced grain production, most of the members became grain-deficient households. Now these six people have realized that "blindly engaging in commerce harms the collective and oneself." Tang Tianyi, the member who usually incited people to do business, recognized his mistake in this socialist education and took the initiative to make a self-criticism to the members at the conference, and guaranteed that he would no longer do business in the future and would resolutely not take the capitalist road. Many members also pointed out that in the old society, they suffered from various exploitations such as land rent, usury, unscrupulous merchants and exorbitant taxes. After liberation, the Communist Party led them to turn over and eradicate these exploitations, and dig up these roots of poverty. Now that they are starting to live a good socialist life, they firmly stated that they could no longer live a capitalist restoration life where the majority are poor and a minority become rich.

    盲目经商，害社害己
    边防农业社进行社会主义教育后
    绝大部分社员表示安心农业生产
    据新华社福州15日电  福建省云霄县峢嶼乡边防农业社，向社员进行社会主义教育后，许多弃农经商的社员，决心不走资本主义道路，回社安心农业生产。
    边防社社员汤田宜，自己不爱农业劳动，经常去搞些小买卖。有些社员受到汤田宜的煽动，跟着他放下田不种，去当小贩搞商业投机。由于边防社没有及时批判这种弃农经商的资本主义倾向，自6月份以来，全社竟有一百多人参加这种商业活动。其中有八十多人，在农村抢购甘薯丝，运到云霄县城黑市贩卖；有二十多人，跑到邻近的东山县贩运鱼类；还有一些人专门经营柴火买卖。大量的人员从事商业活动，使社里劳力奇缺，严重地影响了农业生产。甚至在夏收大忙中很多社员也放着成熟的庄稼不去收割，仍出去经商。
    根据这一情况，中共峢嶼乡支部最近结合反资产阶级右派斗争的宣传，向社员进行了一次社会主义教育，并指出做投机买卖对国家对农业社和对自己的危害性。号召社员应该和商人划清界限，努力生产粮食和其他作物，共同建设社会主义。接着，党支部还利用各种各样的会议组织社员辩论“弃农经商”好不好。在会议上，赵胡生产组从事商业活动的社员，用自己的事实论证经商的严重危害性。这个生产组共十一个劳力，但有六个去做买卖，组里农业生产没人管，夏季农作物减了产，折合约值四百多元。因为粮食减产，大部分社员变成了缺粮户。现在这六个人才认识到“盲目经商，害社害己”。平时煽动人家做生意的社员汤田宜，在这一场社会主义教育中认识到自己的错误，主动在大会上向社员做了检讨，并保证今后不再做买卖，坚决不走资本主义道路。许多社员也指出，在旧社会他们身受田租、高利贷、奸商和苛捐杂税的种种剥削，解放后共产党领导他们翻了身，铲除了这些剥削，挖掉这些穷根，现在开始要过社会主义的好日子，坚决表示不能再过多数人穷、少数人致富的那种资本主义复辟的日子。
