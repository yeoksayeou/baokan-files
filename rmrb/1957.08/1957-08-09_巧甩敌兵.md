Cleverly Shaking Off Enemy Soldiers
Wang Junmin, Former Party Representative of the 2nd Company, 2nd Regiment

One day after the "August 7th" Conference in 1927, Comrade Mao Zedong, disguised as a merchant along with Mao Zemin and Pan Xinyuan, set out from Anyuan to Tonggu to organize and lead our regiment (the Independent Regiment of the 20th Red Army) in participating in the Autumn Harvest Uprising. The three of them traveled across mountains and rivers, bypassing several enemy blockades, and arrived in the territory of Liuyang County. Unexpectedly, between Wenjia City and Zhangfang Town in Liuyang, the three were detained by enemy sentries. One of the sentries recognized Pan Xinyuan and, without saying a word, took Pan Xinyuan away [Note]. At that time, Pan Xinyuan winked at Comrade Mao Zedong, meaning: "A wise man doesn't fight when the odds are against him."

The enemy sentry insisted that the two of them were in the same gang as Pan Xinyuan and were all "rioters," refusing to let them go. Comrade Mao Zedong calmly said to the enemy sentry, "We are good people and definitely not 'rioters.' We came here to do business and buy ramie cloth. We didn't know him (referring to Pan) and only met him on the road. We haven't even traveled two li together! Besides, the world is so chaotic. If you arrest us and take us to the regimental headquarters, we will inevitably be beaten to death, and two innocent lives will be lost. I'm afraid your conscience won't allow it!" As Comrade Mao Zedong spoke, he took out a handful of foreign coins and handed them over: "Friends, we don't have much money with us. Here are a few coins for you to have tea and wine!" The leading sentry took the money and said, "You can go!"

They hadn't walked a hundred steps when a sentry shouted from behind, "No, they must be rioters. We can't let them go. Arrest them and take them to the regimental headquarters for questioning." Then the enemy sentries all shouted, "Stop, stop!" and chased after them. Comrade Mao Zedong thought, it's no use being soft now. We have to think of another way.... He turned around, calmed himself, and said, "Friends, what do you want now? Is the money not enough to divide? Okay! We'll only keep enough for our hotel stay, and give you the rest!" As he spoke, he took out the money and handed it over. Deliberately, he fumbled, and more than a dozen shiny silver dollars clinked and clattered to the ground, scattering into the roadside grass. The enemy sentries were in a frenzy, scrambling to grab the money.

Taking advantage of the opportunity, they took several big steps, darted into a thatched mound, ran to the edge of the pond, climbed down, and hid in the tangled grass by the ditch, which was more than a person deep.

The enemy sentries picked up the money and looked up to see that the people were gone. They shouted in surprise, "It's over, they've run away, run away! Quick, chase them!"

The enemy sentries chased for more than a li without seeing anyone. They blamed each other, "Now it's certain, they are two real rioters. They couldn't have run so fast. They must be hiding in the nearby grass mounds. Let's go back and search!"

The enemy sentries returned and poked around in the area with spears, all the while shouting loudly. After poking through the nearby grass mounds, they found nothing. The enemy was losing steam, but they were still unwilling to give up. Finally, the enemy stabbed directly into the place where the two of them were hiding, almost hitting them. The two held their breath and remained quiet, with only one thought in their minds: if we are found, we will fight them. We must not be captured alive!

By this time, it was already dark. The enemy searched for more than two hours, exhausted and cursing each other, and left dejectedly.

Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Mao Zemin escaped from the tiger's mouth in this way, and with the protection of the peasants along the way, they came to Tonggu, organized and led our regiment in participating in the great Autumn Harvest Uprising.

(Recorded by Zeng Boqing)

[Note] Comrade Pan Xinyuan later escaped cleverly and served as the political commissar of the 2nd Red Regiment. He was arrested in April 1928 and died heroically.

    巧甩敌兵
    原红二团二连党代表　王俊民
    1927年“八七”会议后的一天，毛泽东同志和毛泽民、潘心元两人，商人打扮，从安源动身，到铜鼓去组织并领导我团（红二十军独立团）参加秋收起义。三人一路翻山涉水，绕过敌人数道封锁线，来到浏阳县境。不料在浏阳的文家市与张坊镇之间，三人被敌人哨兵扣留了。有个哨兵原先认识潘心元，二话没说，就把潘心元押走了〔注〕。当时潘心元给毛泽东同志使了个眼色，意思是说：“好汉不吃眼前亏。”
    敌哨兵一口咬定说他俩和潘心元是一伙人，都是“暴徒”，缠着不放。毛泽东同志沉着地对敌哨兵说：“我们是好人，决不是‘暴徒’，是来这里做生意买夏布的。跟他（指潘）从不相认，才在路上碰到的，还没同行两里路哩！再说，这个世道这样乱，若把我俩抓到团局去，少不得一顿死打，白白杀掉两条好人性命，恐怕你们也问不过良心吧！”毛泽东同志说着，摸出一把洋钱递过去：“朋友，我们带的钱不多，送几块给你们去吃茶喝酒吧！”领头的一个哨兵接过钱，便说：“你们走吧！”
    他们转身还没走出一百步，后面有个哨兵嚷起来：“不行，这一定是暴徒，不能放走，抓到团局去盘问盘问再说。”接着敌哨兵一齐吆喝起来：“站住，站住！”说着就追了上来。毛泽东同志想，这时再来软的是不行了，得另想办法……。他一回身，沉住气，说：“朋友，又要干什么？是不是钱不够分？好了！我们只留下住旅店的，其余的统统给你们！”他一边说一边掏出钱递过去，故意一失手，十几块白晃晃的洋钱，叮叮当当地掉在地上，四散滚进路边草丛里去。敌哨兵们就手忙脚乱地只顾去抢钱了。
    他们乘机走出几大步，一闪身拐进茅草垅，跑到池塘边，爬下去，钻进水沟旁边一人多深的乱草丛里隐蔽了起来。
    敌哨兵拾完钱，抬头一看，人不见了，惊讶得直喊：“完了，人跑了，跑了！快追！”
    敌哨兵追了一里多地没见人影，互相埋怨：“这下可肯定了，完全是两个真正的暴徒。保险跑不了这样快，一定躲在附近的草垅里，回去搜索！”
    敌哨兵折回来用梭镖在这一带乱刺了一阵，一面还不住地大声吵嚷着。附近草垅都刺过了，一无所获，敌人有些泄劲了，但仍不甘心。最后，敌人直刺到他们两人躲的地方，差一点刺到人。二人屏息静气，心里只有一个念头：要被搜到，就和他们拼了，要想抓活的万不能！
    这时天已黑了下来，敌人搜了二个多钟头，精疲力尽，互相谩骂了一气，垂头丧气地走了。
    毛泽东同志和毛泽民同志就这样逃脱了虎口，沿途经农民们的掩护，来到铜鼓，组织和领导着我团参加了伟大的秋收起义斗争。
                    （曾伯清记）
    〔注〕潘心元同志后来不久就机智地逃了出来，担任红二团政委，1928年4月被捕，壮烈牺牲。
