National Army and Civilians Unite
To Overcome Several Floods Since the Flood Season

    This newspaper reports: Our people have achieved great victories in the fight against this year's floods. Currently, the water levels of China's major rivers—the Yangtze, Yellow, Huai, and Pearl Rivers—are stable. Water levels have generally receded below the guaranteed water level or around the warning water level.

    Since the beginning of the flood season, the Dongjiang, Beijiang, and Hanjiang rivers, tributaries of the Pearl River; the Shaying and Yi-Shu rivers of the Huai River; the Hanshui River of the Yangtze River; and the lower reaches of the Yellow River have all experienced several major flood peaks. The lower reaches of the Yellow River, the Pearl River, and the Huai River were once the most critical. The water levels at Qingyuan Station on the Beijiang River and Huiyang Station on the Dongjiang River exceeded the guaranteed water level. The upper reaches of the Hanjiang River experienced the largest flood in nearly 20 years due to mountain torrents. The Huayuankou section of the Yellow River's main stream experienced two dangerous flood peaks of 12,600 cubic meters per second and 13,000 cubic meters per second in one day. When the flood peak reached the Sunkou Hydrological Station, the water level was 1.18 meters higher than in 1954, exceeding the guaranteed water level by 0.16 meters. The Yi-Shu River, a tributary of the Huai River, experienced eight flood peaks, and the Shahe River experienced seven flood peaks, exceeding the guaranteed water level three times. The peak flow rate at Linqi Station reached a record high of 15,500 cubic meters per second.

    Water conservancy projects built on major rivers in recent years have received and diverted floodwaters during the flood season, reducing flood peaks. During the tense moment when the Yi-Shu River experienced eight consecutive flood peaks, the Jiangfengkou Sluice was opened for flood diversion. Luoma Lake and Huangdun Lake over-detained floodwaters exceeding the guaranteed water level. The Nihewa project on the Shahe River was opened four times in a planned manner for flood diversion, keeping the water level at Luohe Station below the guaranteed water level, ensuring the safety of the Beijing-Hankou Railway. The flood peak in the upper reaches of the Hanshui River was diverted through the Dujiatai Flood Diversion Sluice, greatly reducing the intensity of the flood downstream. Although the water levels of the Yellow River and the Pearl River were very high this year, the flood resistance capacity of the dikes was greatly enhanced due to the repairs and reinforcements of the dikes and the elimination of hidden dangers in recent years, reducing flood damage.

    Under the leadership of the central and local flood control authorities and with the support of all parties, the broad masses of people in the river basins fought heroically against the floods. When the lower reaches of the Yellow River entered a tense period of flood control and after the disaster occurred, the Central Flood Control Headquarters and the People's Liberation Army Navy and Air Force mobilized a large amount of materials for support and rescue. The Air Force dispatched more than 80 aircraft, airdropping more than 400,000 catties of cooked food and more than 4,300 life jackets; the Navy allocated more than 420 rubber boats, 83 trucks, 25 amphibious vehicles, and various other life-saving and rescue materials from Qingdao, Jinan, and other places, and sent them to disaster areas for rescue. In addition to self-organizing a large number of wooden boats, the disaster-stricken areas also mobilized the masses to gather materials locally and build a large number of wooden rafts for rescuing people trapped by the water. In addition, the Shandong Provincial Flood Control Headquarters immediately dispatched more than 140,000 gunny sacks, 130,000 straw sacks, 160,000 rush bags, 100 tons of lead wire, more than 14,000 wooden stakes, 200,000 straw mats, and a large number of medicines to the disaster areas. So far, more than 4.81 million mu of farmland in Heze Prefecture have been drained, more than 400,000 mu of accumulated water have been drained in seven counties in Linqi Prefecture (incomplete statistics), more than 36,000 houses have been repaired, 320,000 mu have been drained in Tai'an Prefecture, and more than 1.6 million mu of land have been dried out in Jining Prefecture.

    In recent days, with the water level receding, the reservoirs and controlled lake depressions and flood storage projects on the rivers have successively opened their gates to release water, preparing to empty them in order to cope with possible reoccurrences of floods. At present, the broad masses of people in the river basins are strengthening and consolidating dikes and conducting other work to prepare for overcoming possible recurrences of floods.

    全国军民齐心协力
    入汛以来战胜数次洪水
    本报讯　我国人民在同今年的洪水作斗争中，取得了巨大胜利。目前，我国主要江河长江、黄河，淮河、珠江水势平稳。水位一般都回落到保证水位以下或警戒水位上下。
    从入汛以来，我国珠江支流东江、北江、韩江，淮河的沙颍河、沂沭河，长江的汉水和黄河下游，都先后出现过多次较大洪峰。以黄河下游，珠江和淮河一度最为吃紧。珠江北江的清远站，东江的惠阳站水位都超过了保证水位，韩江上游因山洪暴发，出现了近二十年来最大的洪水。黄河干流花园口，曾在一天当中出现过一万二千六百秒公方和一万三千秒公方两次险恶洪峰，洪峰传到孙口水位站，水位比1954年还高出一点一八公尺，超过保证水位零点一六公尺。淮河支流沂沭河出现过八次洪峰，沙河出现过七次洪峰，有三次超过保证水位。临沂站出现洪峰流量一万五千五百秒公方的破历史纪录。
    几年来建设在各大江河上的水利工程，在汛期接纳和分泄了洪水，削减了洪峰。当沂沭河连续八次出现洪峰的紧张时刻，曾利用江风口闸开闸分洪。骆马湖、黄墩湖在超过保证水位的情况下，超额拦蓄了洪水。沙河上的泥河洼工程四次有计划的开闸分洪，使得漯河站水位控制在保证水位以下，确保了京汉铁路的安全。汉水上游出现的洪峰，经过杜家台分洪闸分洪，到了下游洪水凶势大歛。黄河、珠江今年水位虽然很高，但由于几年来培修、加固了堤防，清除了隐患，堤防的抗洪能力大大增强，减免了洪水灾害。
    各江河流域的广大群众在中央和各地防汛机关的领导下，在各方面的支援下，同洪水作了英勇的斗争。当黄河下游进入紧张防汛的时候和在灾情发生后，中央防汛总指挥部和解放军海、空军曾调集大量物资支援和抢救。空军共出动飞机八十余架次，计共空投熟食品四十余万斤，救生衣四千三百多件；海军在青岛、济南等地拨出橡皮船四百二十多只、汽车八十三部、水陆两用汽车二十五部和其他多种救生抢险物资，分送灾区抢救。受灾地区除自行组织了大量木船外，还发动群众就地取材扎了大批木排，用作抢救被水围困的群众。此外，山东省防汛指挥部并即时调出麻袋十四万余条，草袋十三万条，蒲包十六万条，铅丝一百吨，木桩一万四千多根，席子二十万领和大量医药品运往受灾地区。到目前为止，菏泽专区已有四百八十一万多亩农田脱水，临沂专区七个县不完全统计已排出积水四十余万亩，修复房屋三万六千余间，泰安专区已排出三十二万亩，济宁专区也涸出土地一百六十余万亩。
    近几天来，随着水位回落，各江河上的水库和有控制的湖泊洼地蓄洪工程，都相继开闸放水，准备腾空后以对待可能再次发生的洪水。目前各江河流域的广大人民正在进行堤防的加固和整险等工作，准备战胜可能再出现的洪水。
