    上海足球队在波兰访问比赛结束
    新华社华沙27日电　上海足球队在罗兹等地作了访问比赛后，今天早晨回到华沙。在这些场比赛当中，上海队越战越强。
    上海队在8月20日同波兰最强的足球队之一罗兹代表队比赛，结果以一比九败给罗兹队。22日，在卡托维兹同这个城市的代表队进行了比赛。上半局只有上海队踢入一球，双方防守很严，当时又下着大雨。在下半局最后七分钟的时候，才被卡托维兹队踢入一球，比赛以一比一结束。
    最紧张、最激烈的战斗是26日同克拉科夫代表队的比赛。这个队也是波兰最强的足球队之一。比赛中双方互不相让，自始至终双方都没有踢入一球，却都救起了不少险球，博得了看台上近万人的春雷般的掌声。最后，零比零的纪录轰动了球场。这时观众拥向球场，把上海队的队员们高高抬起，欢乐而散。
    上海足球队将在29日离开波兰前往苏联。
