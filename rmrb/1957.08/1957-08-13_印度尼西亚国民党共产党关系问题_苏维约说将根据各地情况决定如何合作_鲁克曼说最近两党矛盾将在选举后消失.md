Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 12th: Suwirjo, Chairman of the Indonesian Nationalist Party (PNI), today expressed his views to the press for the first time on the question of relations between the PNI and the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI). He said that whether the PNI cooperates with the PKI and other political parties will be "decided based on the actual conditions in each locality." For example, in Jakarta, the PNI can cooperate with the PKI, but in places like Semarang, where the PKI has an absolute majority in the local council, the PNI will cooperate with the Masyumi Party.

Suwirjo said that the PNI Central Committee will hold a meeting to discuss the issue of relations with the PKI and other political parties. This meeting will be held after the results of the election in West Java Province are announced. He said that if the PNI abandons the "old form of cooperation" with the PKI, it does not mean that the PNI will cooperate with the Masyumi Party.

He also said that the PNI and the PKI have the same position on realizing the Sukarno Plan, but the substance may not be the same.

The PKI has consistently maintained a cautious attitude towards the recent issue of its relationship with the PNI. Lukman, Deputy General Secretary of the PKI, told a reporter from the Indonesian News Agency today that the recent conflicts between the two parties were inevitable during the recent local council elections and that these conflicts would disappear after the elections ended. He believes that the relationship between the two parties has not broken down.

Lukman believes that the two parties have different ideological systems, but they also have common interests, so the two parties have maintained a good relationship. Lukman also pointed out that some people are currently exaggerating the issue of the relationship between the PNI and the PKI.

    印度尼西亚国民党共产党关系问题
    苏维约说将根据各地情况决定如何合作
    鲁克曼说最近两党矛盾将在选举后消失
    据新华社雅加达12日电　印度尼西亚国民党总主席苏维约今天就国民党和印度尼西亚共产党的关系问题第一次向报界发表了意见。他说，国民党是否同印度尼西亚共产党以及其他政党合作，将“根据各地的实际情况来决定”。例如，在雅加达，国民党可以同印度尼西亚共产党合作，但是在三宝垅等印度尼西亚共产党在地方议会中占绝对优势的地方，国民党就要同马斯友美党合作。
    苏维约说，国民党中央委员会将举行会议，讨论同印度尼西亚共产党和其它政党的关系问题。这个会议将在西爪哇省选举结果揭晓以后举行。他说，如果国民党放弃同印度尼西亚共产党的“旧形式的合作”，并不意味着国民党就将同马斯友美党合作。
    他还说，国民党同印度尼西亚共产党实现苏加诺方案的立场是相同的，但是实质未必相同。
    印度尼西亚共产党对于最近出现的这个党同国民党的关系问题，始终抱着慎重的态度。印度尼西亚共产党副总书记鲁克曼今天对印度尼西亚新闻社记者说，最近两党之间发生的矛盾，是在最近这次地方议会选举中必然发生的事情，在选举结束以后，这种矛盾将要消失。他认为两党之间的关系并没有破裂。
    鲁克曼认为，两党的思想体系是有区别的，但是也有共同的利益，因此两党保持了良好的关系。鲁克曼还指出，目前有些人正在就印度尼西亚国民党和共产党之间发生的关系问题进行夸大的宣传。
