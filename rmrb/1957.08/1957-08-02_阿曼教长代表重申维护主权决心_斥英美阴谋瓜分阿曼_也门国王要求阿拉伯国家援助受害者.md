    Xinhua News Agency, 1st August dispatch from Cairo: The Oman Imam's representative in Cairo on July 31st accused Britain and the United States of plotting to divide Oman and the Buraimi Oasis.
    The Imam's representative, Halsa, said: "There are reports that Dulles and Macmillan held talks in London with the aim of giving the United States the right to free action in the Buraimi Oasis and giving Britain the right to free action in the Imamate of Oman. I personally tend to believe these reports. They have a familiar ring to them. They sound just like the old tricks of power politics in the Middle East."
    Halsa said: "It is still hoped that the United States can help resolve the dispute between Britain and Oman." But he reiterated that the Omanis would not accept any solution unless it recognized the independence and sovereignty of the Omanis.
    Halsa also said that Imam Ali, who leads the Omani nationalist movement, is still in Nizwa, the capital of Oman.
    On the same day, Arab League Secretary-General Hassouna sent a note to all Arab League countries, requesting that they provide speedy assistance to the victims of Oman.
    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, August 1st dispatch: The Egyptian "Evening News" reported on July 31st that King Ahmed of Yemen condemned the British aggression against Oman and demanded that Arab countries assist the Imam of Oman, Ghalib Ali. The telegram expressing this view by the King of Yemen has arrived at the Yemeni Embassy in Cairo.
    It is reported that the Oman Imam's representative in Cairo has discussed with the Arab League authorities the ways to submit the Oman issue to international organizations.

    阿曼教长代表重申维护主权决心
    斥英美阴谋瓜分阿曼
    也门国王要求阿拉伯国家援助受害者
    新华社1日讯　开罗消息：阿曼教长驻开罗代表7月31日指责英国和美国阴谋瓜分阿曼和布赖米绿洲。
    教长代表哈尔赛说：“有消息说，杜勒斯和麦克米伦在伦敦举行会谈，目的要让美国在布赖米绿洲有自由行动的权利而让英国对阿曼教长国有自由行动的权利。我个人倾向于相信这些消息。它们有一个熟悉的调子。它们听起来就好像中东的强权政治的老把戏。”
    哈尔赛说：“现在仍然希望美国能帮助解决英国和阿曼之间的争端。”但是他重申，除非是承认阿曼人的独立和主权，阿曼人是不会接受任何解决办法的。
    哈尔赛还说，领导阿曼民族主义运动的阿里教长仍然在阿曼首府尼兹瓦。
    同一天，阿拉伯联盟秘书长哈苏纳向所有阿拉伯联盟国家发出一项照会，要求各国火速援助阿曼的受害者。
    新华社开罗1日电　埃及“晚报”7月31日报道，也门国王艾哈迈德谴责英国对阿曼的侵略，并且要求阿拉伯国家援助阿曼教长加勒布·阿里。也门国王作这一表示的电报已经到达也门驻开罗公使馆。
    据报道，阿曼教长驻开罗代表已经同阿拉伯联盟当局讨论了把阿曼问题提交国际机构的方式。
