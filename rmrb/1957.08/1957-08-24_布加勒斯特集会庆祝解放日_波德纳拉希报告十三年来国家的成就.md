　　Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, August 23rd: A rally was held in Bucharest on the evening of August 22nd to celebrate the 13th anniversary of Romania's liberation.

　　Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, Prime Minister Chivu Stoica, other party and government leaders, representatives from all walks of life, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to Romania attended the rally.

　　Emil Bodnaras, member of the Political Bureau of the Romanian Workers' Party and Vice-Chairman of the Council of Ministers, delivered a report at the rally on the 13th anniversary of Romania's liberation.

　　Bodnaras first described how the Romanian Communist Party organized and led the armed uprising of August 23, 1944, and how it established the people's democratic regime. He then introduced the construction achievements of the past thirteen years. He said that compared with 1938, the production of the chemical industry had increased by 7.6 times. Calculated per capita, the amount of pig iron per person increased from 8.5 kilograms in 1938 to 33 kilograms, steel from 18 kilograms to 44 kilograms, natural gas from 19 cubic meters to 248 cubic meters, electricity from 72 degrees to 280 degrees, and cement from 32 kilograms to 124 kilograms.

　　The speaker pointed out that great achievements have also been made in agricultural cooperation. So far, the cooperativized land has accounted for 37% of the total cultivated land in the country. The Party has abolished the requisition system and implemented a policy of advance purchase and procurement, thereby further strengthening the worker-peasant alliance and the leadership of the working class over the worker-peasant alliance. The Party is mobilizing broader masses to participate in leadership, overcoming over-centralization, expanding the powers of people's councils and economic enterprises, and strengthening their ties with the masses.

　　Bodnaras said that the leadership of the Party is the main factor in consolidating the people's democratic regime. The unity of the Party is the only guarantee for realizing the Party's leadership. The central task of the Party is to connect with the masses.

　　In his report, Bodnaras also talked about Romania's foreign policy. He said that the Party is resolutely striving to ease international tensions and to unite the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

　　When talking about the relations between Romania and Yugoslavia, Bodnaras said that the relations between the two countries are based on Marxism-Leninism, and this relationship is continuing to develop. We express our complete satisfaction with the recent Soviet-Yugoslav talks.

　　Bodnaras also pointed out that the Romanian people express their heartfelt support for the struggle of the Omani people for national independence.

　  波德纳拉希报告十三年来国家的成就
    据新华社布加勒斯特23日电  布加勒斯特8月22日晚间举行大会，庆祝罗马尼亚解放十三周年。
    罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会第一书记乔治乌—德治、部长会议主席斯托伊卡和其他党政领导人、各界代表以及各国驻罗马尼亚的外交使节都出席了大会。
    罗马尼亚工人党政治局委员、部长会议副主席埃·波德纳拉希在大会上作了关于罗马尼亚解放十三周年的报告。
    波德纳拉希首先叙述了罗马尼亚共产党怎样组织和领导了1944年8月23日的武装起义和如何建立了人民民主政权。接着，他介绍了十三年来的建设成就。他说，拿1956年和1938年相比，化学工业生产提高了七点六倍。按人口平均计算，每人分到的生铁由1938年的八点五公斤提高到三十三公斤，钢由十八公斤提高到四十四公斤，天然气由十九立方公尺提高到二百四十八立方公尺，电力由七十二度提高到二百八十度，水泥由三十二公斤提高到一百二十四公斤。
    报告人指出，在农业合作化方面也取得了很大的成就。到目前为止，合作化了的土地已经占全国总耕地面积的37％。党取消了征购制，实行了预购和收购的政策，从而进一步加强了工农联盟和工人阶级对工农联盟的领导。党正在动员更广大的群众参加领导，克服过分集中的现象，扩大人民会议和经济企业的职权，加强它们和群众的联系。
    波德纳拉希说，党的领导是人民民主政权巩固的主要因素。党的团结是实现党的领导的唯一保证。党的中心任务是联系群众。
    波德纳拉希在报告中还谈到了罗马尼亚的外交政策。他说，党坚决为缓和国际紧张局势、为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结而努力。
    在谈到罗马尼亚和南斯拉夫的关系的时候，波德纳拉希说，两国关系是建立在马克思列宁主义的基础上的，这种关系正在继续发展。我们对苏、南最近举行的会谈表示完全满意。
    波德纳拉希还指出，罗马尼亚人民对阿曼人民争取民族独立的斗争表示衷心的支持。
