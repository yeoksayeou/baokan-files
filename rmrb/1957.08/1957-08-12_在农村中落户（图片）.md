Settling Down in the Countryside

On August 8th, the members of the Dengta First Agricultural Cooperative in Tai'an County, Shandong Province, welcomed fourteen middle and primary school graduates from Jinan with gongs and drums to settle down in their village and participate in agricultural production. Before these middle and primary school graduates arrived, the cooperative members were busy. Some were preparing houses for them; some cooperative members went to the cooperative committee to request that students settle down in their homes; the cooperative committee and production team also held special meetings to study how to teach these new students agricultural techniques and other issues.

The fourteen middle and primary school graduates who settled down in this cooperative were graduating senior and junior high school students and former senior primary school graduates from Jinan.

    在农村中落户
    8月8日这一天，山东省泰安县灯塔第一农业社的社员，敲锣打鼓接待了从济南来的十四名中、小学毕业生到他们那里安家落户，参加农业生产。这批中、小学毕业生没有来到之前，社员们就忙起来了。有的为他们准备房屋；有的社员到社委会请求让学生到他家里落户；社委会和生产队也专门召开会议，研究如何教这批新来的学生学习农业技术等问题。
    到这个社落户的十四名中、小学毕业生，是济南市应届高、初中毕业生和往年高小毕业生。
