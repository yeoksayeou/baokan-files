Folk Songs of the 1857 Indian War of Independence

The Rule of the East India Company
Have you seen the flag of the East India Company, my dear wife?
The mighty Lake [1] conquered the lands of the whole country,
The arrogant soldiers wore red coats,
With bullet pouches on their shoulders and black stones [2] in their hands.
Infantry in the front, artillery in the rear,
In the roaring cannon fire,
Hindus and Muslims fled and were displaced.
Each British officer leads ten companies,
With a command and a point: "Fire, damn it!"
They are so brutal that people dare not breathe.
[1] Lake was a British general at the time.
[2] Black stones refer to black grenades.

Meerut
Look, look! In the town of Meerut,
The foreign devils were ambushed,
The colonists suffered a blow!
In the spacious town of Meerut,
Look, look! They were beaten, their guns were taken,
Their horses died on the ground, their revolvers were smashed.
In the spacious town of Meerut,
They were ambushed!
Look, look! The colonists suffered a blow,
In the spacious town of Meerut.

The Storm
The Ganges sends forth a storm,
The British flee in terror,
Quick, get back, treacherous robbers!

Whips and Bullets
Whips and bullets have been used at will for a hundred years, [1]
Today, you British devils are scattering like bums,
You can hold parades in London parks at will,
But, colonial devils, today you must return our land!
[1] Since the Battle of Plassey in 1757, Britain has completely ruled India.

Oath
As long as we live, we will never give up Kalpi!
We will never bury our independence with our own hands! [1]
[1] This is a song of the insurgents of Kalpi at the time. Led by their leader, they held the holy water from the Jamuna River in their hands and swore to heaven. "Independence" in the original text is "Azad Shahsi," which includes the meaning of "free country."

Editor's Note: On May 10, 1857, the Indian people held an anti-British uprising. This year, August 15th (Indian Independence Day) India also commemorates the centenary of the "Anti-British Uprising." Here are a few folk songs from that time as a commemoration of this festival.

    1857年印度独立战争的民歌
    东印度公司的统治你可曾看到东印度公司的旗，我亲爱的妻子？威武的雷克〔一〕征服了全国的土地，蛮横的大兵穿着红色的外衣，肩上背着子弹袋，手里拿着黑石子〔二〕步兵在前，炮兵在后，在轰轰隆隆的炮声里，印度教徒和穆士林逃亡流离。每一个英国军官率领十个连队命令一发，手一指：“开枪，他妈的！”他们这样残暴，吓得人不敢呼吸。〔一〕雷克是当时一个英国将军。〔二〕黑石子是指黑色的手榴弹，
    密鲁特〔一〕看呀，看！在密鲁特的市镇里，洋鬼子遭到了埋伏，殖民者尝到了打击！在密鲁特宽敞的市镇里，看呀，看！他们挨了揍，枪枝被夺去，马儿死在地上，左轮被砸碎。在宽敞的密鲁特市镇里，他们遭到了伏击！看呀，看！殖民者遭到打击，在密鲁特宽敞的市镇里。
    〔一〕密鲁特在德里以西一百多里，起义从此地开始。
    暴风恒河发出风暴，英国人逃之夭夭，快快滚回去吧，背信弃义的强盗！
    鞭子和子弹鞭子和子弹，已经随意用了一百年，〔一〕今天，你们英国鬼子却像瘪三一样东逃西散，你们可以随心随意在伦敦公园举行检阅，但是，殖民鬼，今天要把我们的土地归还！
    〔一〕自从1757年普来锡战争后，英国就整个统治了印度。
    誓词只要我们活着，决不放弃卡尔比！我们决不用自己的手埋葬我们的独立！〔一〕
    〔一〕这是当时卡尔比的起义者，在他们的领导者带领下，用双手捧起贾木纳河中的圣水，向天宣誓的歌。“独立”原文为“阿查德沙细”，此词包括“自由国家”的意思。
          （高　梁　译）
    编者附记：1857年5月10日，印度人民举行了反英大起义。今年8月15日（印度独立纪念日）印度同时纪念“反英大起义”一百周年。这里选了几首当时的民歌，作为对这个节日的纪念。
