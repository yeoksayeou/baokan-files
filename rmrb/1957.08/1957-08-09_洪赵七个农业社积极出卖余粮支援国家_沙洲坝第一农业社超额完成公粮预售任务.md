Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 7th: Seven agricultural cooperatives in Nanqin Township, Hongzhao County, Shanxi Province, have exceeded their wheat unified purchase task by 160,000 jin.

This year, Nanqin Township had a bumper wheat harvest. However, many cooperative members initially wanted to sell less and keep more, and some cooperative cadres deliberately concealed the yield. The Nanqin Township Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in response to this erroneous practice that disregarded the country's needs, mobilized cooperative members and cadres to discuss the questions of "What does the bumper wheat harvest depend on?" and "Why sell more surplus grain?" Through discussion, the cooperative members realized that this year's bumper wheat harvest was inseparable from the strong support of the state. When there were floods and waterlogging last year, the state not only reduced the public grain quota but also transferred 950,000 jin of grain from various places. The cooperative members realized from these facts that it was a capitalist mindset to ask the state for grain and loans after the disaster last year, but then want to sell less and keep more after the bumper harvest this year. Therefore, they actively sold surplus grain to support national construction. Now, all seven agricultural cooperatives in the township have sold 900,000 jin of wheat, in addition to retaining the necessary food rations, feed, seeds, and the public grain to be paid.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 7th: The Shazhouba First Agricultural Cooperative in Ruijin County, Jiangxi Province, completed the advance delivery of summer public grain and exceeded the advance sale task. All 34,100 jin of public grain have been delivered to the granary, and the 25,000 jin summer surplus grain pre-sale task has been exceeded by more than 600 jin.

This cooperative was the site of the Central Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Government during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, and has always excelled in paying public grain and selling surplus grain. This year, when harvesting early rice, the cooperative members selected grains that were full and free of pests and diseases, and harvested, threshed, dried, and stored them separately for paying public grain and selling surplus grain. All the pre-delivered and pre-sold grain was fanned one more time than the retained food rations. The members of the Second Production Team, who were close neighbors with Chairman Mao twenty-three years ago, delivered 9,700 jin of grain with no impurities.

    洪赵七个农业社积极出卖余粮支援国家
    沙洲坝第一农业社超额完成公粮预售任务
    据新华社太原7日电　山西省洪赵县南秦乡七个农业社超额十六万斤完成了小麦统购任务。
    今年南秦乡小麦丰收。但是许多社员开始都想少卖多留，有的社干部也故意隐瞒产量。中共南秦乡党委会针对这种不顾国家的错误做法，发动社员和社干部讨论了“小麦丰收靠什么”、“多卖余粮为了啥”两个问题。经过讨论，社员们认识到今年小麦丰收是和国家的大力扶植分不开的。当去年雨涝成灾，国家不仅少征公粮，还从各地调运来九十五万斤粮食。社员们从这些事实中认识到：去年遭灾后伸手向国家要粮要贷款，今年丰收了就要少卖多留，这是资本主义思想在作怪。于是他们积极出卖余粮支持国家建设。现在全乡七个农业社除留了需用的口粮、饲料、种籽和应征的公粮外，已售小麦九十万斤。
    新华社南昌7日电　江西省瑞金县沙洲坝第一农业社提前完成夏季公粮预送和超额完成预售任务。三万四千一百多斤公粮已全部送到粮库，二万五千斤夏季余粮预售任务，超额完成了六百多斤。
    这个社是第二次国内革命战争时期中央工农民主政府所在地，历年缴纳公粮出售余粮都很出色。今年在收割早稻的时候，社员们挑选了谷粒饱满、没有病虫害的谷子，进行单收、单打、单晒、单藏，用来缴纳公粮，卖售余粮，所有预送、预售的粮食都比留用的口粮多扇了一次。二十三年前和毛主席作过亲密邻居的第二生产队社员们，预送的九千七百斤粮食没有一点杂质。
