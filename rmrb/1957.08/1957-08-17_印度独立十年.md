    Ten Years of Indian Independence
    Gao Liang

    Ten years ago, on a rainy monsoon morning of August 15th in Delhi, crowds surged towards the ancient Red Fort like a torrent breaking through a dam. Here, Nehru slowly raised the tricolor flag of the independent Republic of India into the sky for the first time. At that moment, the whole country resounded with the joyous bells of independence.

    Almost exactly one hundred years ago, a major event also occurred here. Unwilling to endure the oppression of the British, Indian soldiers in the British army in Meerut staged a mutiny, stormed into Delhi on the starry night of May 10th, and raised the banner of uprising on the Red Fort. The Red Fort, the palace of ancient emperors, has since become a symbol of Indian independence and victory.

    Almost every Indian over the age of twenty clearly remembers that at midnight on August 14th, ten years ago, after the clock struck twelve and announced the beginning of August 15th, the British rulers helplessly handed over power to the Indian Constituent Assembly.

    An Indian journalist once described to me what he saw at the time. As soon as it got dark on August 14th, women, wearing new saris, lit thousands of small clay oil lamps arranged together in front of their doors and under their eaves, waiting all night for auspicious news. Tens of thousands of people from the countryside poured over the Jamuna River bridge, singing and shouting slogans, marching towards Delhi. Workers' teams holding large flags and soldiers driving armored cars converged in front of the Constituent Assembly Hall. Civil servants, receiving their government salaries for the first time, also came here. The square and the people were covered with rose petals and all kinds of tropical flowers. Groups of students also walked over, with a few people carrying a straw effigy of a corpse on their shoulders, labeled with the four characters "Imperialism". They were holding a funeral for imperialism, shouting loudly: "Imperialism is dead!" "Long live independence!"

    Now it is the tenth August 15th. The independent Indian people are celebrating the tenth anniversary of Indian independence, and also celebrating the centenary of the Indian War of Independence. Pride and joy are revealed on everyone's face, while also pondering the tragic fate of the past that can never be forgotten.

    If you mention the past era of India's enslavement, every upright person will feel bitterness and indignation. India, known as the "Golden Bird" and "Granary of Mankind," once a prosperous country full of rice, milk, honey, and butter, became unimaginably poor and distressed since the British colonists founded the East India Company here and formally established rule with swords after the Battle of Plassey. The industrious and kind Indian people suffered the greatest insults and injustices in the world.

    The War of Independence a hundred years ago was the first large-scale uprising by the vast number of Indian farmers, artisans, soldiers, and some feudal princes who could no longer endure this exploitation and oppression. The first spark of rebellion ignited by soldiers in Meerut quickly spread to the plains of North India. The Ganges River stirred up a storm. The army of the uprising hero Tantia Tope galloped like an eagle along the banks of the Ganges. The brave and resolute Queen of Jhansi, Lakshmibai, fought bravely amidst thousands of troops. When the enemy attacked her strategic fortress of Kalpi, she led her soldiers, holding up the sacred water from the Jamuna River with both hands, and swore to the motherland:

    "As long as we are alive, we will never give up Kalpi.
    We will never bury our independence with our own hands!"

    This year, on May 10th, when the people of Delhi first commemorated this War of Independence, the reporter personally saw the Indian people's mourning for these uprising heroes, and heard them narrate stories about the uprising passed down from the elderly. They will never forget the dark years after the failure of the uprising, when the corpses of the uprising people were hanging from almost every tree on the hundreds of miles of roads from Allahabad to Kanpur. The reporter personally saw that the Kashmir Gate of Old Delhi still bears the marks of bullets left by the British invaders during the counter-attack on Delhi. At the fortress called "Bloody Gate" between New and Old Delhi, crowds of people came to mourn and give speeches. At Chandni Chowk, the center of Old Delhi, where hundreds and thousands of patriots were massacred, many people lingered and paid their respects in front of portraits of Queen Lakshmibai of Jhansi and Tope and other uprising heroes. One of the viewers said to me: "They are all beloved heroes of the Indian people. During British rule, their names were never in history. Only today, after India's independence, are they recorded in our history."

    From conversations with people from all walks of life in India, I learned that they will never forget how Tilak, the leader of the radical faction of the Congress Party who led the national movement in 1908, was imprisoned for six years for demanding complete independence for India, and will never forget the two people who were innocently shot and killed when the masses gathered in Amritsar in 1919. People's hearts miss their beloved leader, Mahatma Gandhi, who walked from village to village for India's independence, calling and organizing the broad masses to resist the British rulers with non-violent and non-cooperative resistance. Until 1946, when Indian sailors serving in the British Royal Navy blew the bugle of uprising and hung the flags of the Congress Party and the Indian Communist Party on British warships, the working class of Calcutta held a general strike to support their sailor brothers. Uprisings, strikes, tax strikes, non-cooperation and other huge mass struggles finally forced the British rulers to withdraw from Indian soil in 1947.

    Today, when talking with any Indian friend about the history of this epic and moving long struggle, you will feel how much they cherish the fruits of independence, and at the same time, how beautiful their aspirations are for the future. In front of them, the era of colonial rule and the painful and bitter journey have ended forever, and a new era and a new journey are beginning.

    Independent India is still very young. For ten years, it has been building its new life under the difficult conditions left by the colonists, filled with hunger, poverty, inequality, and division. The five hundred and fifty-four princely states ruled by feudal princes have been unified, and they no longer appear on the map but have become historical relics; the landlord tax system has also been abolished, and the caste system passed down for thousands of years and the tragic fate suffered by the fifty-five million "untouchables" are also being gradually eradicated and changed. India is building huge factories, projects, residences, hospitals, and schools, and exploring treasures in the rich underground. During the two hundred years that the British ruled India, the total annual output of steel in India was only 890,000 tons, but less than ten years after independence, its annual steel output reached 1.34 million tons in 1956. In terms of the textile industry, it has increased from an annual output of 3.762 billion yards in 1947 to 5.307 billion yards in 1956. In terms of water conservancy and irrigation, the national irrigation area in India was only 51 million acres in 1950-1951, but it will reach 88 million acres by the end of the second five-year plan in 1961.

    However, in India, it is extremely complex and difficult to heal the wounds left by the British rulers over the past two hundred years, which are more serious than any war disaster, and to feed, clothe, and house the people in a short period of time in just ten years. The Indian people know that in order to build their own independent country, they must vigilantly prevent the recurrence of colonialism, maintain their independence and support the independence of other countries, and must have an international peaceful environment to coexist peacefully with all countries, interact with each other, and learn from each other. In Asia, they found a Chinese brother who had a similar tragic fate.

    Speaking of the relationship between the Indian and Chinese peoples, both Indians and Chinese know very well that although they have taken different paths to independence and have different social systems now, they were closely linked by a common destiny in the past in the struggle against colonialism and for independence and liberation. When the people of Delhi commemorated the centenary of the War of Independence this May, Indian historians talked about the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Movement that occurred in China at the same time. One historian and newspaper editor, Vidyalankar, who is already blind, is still enthusiastically studying the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Movement. He said: The people of India and China supported each other in the past struggle against imperialism. It was precisely because the War of Independence broke out in India that British imperialism had to quickly withdraw its troops sent to China, changing its plan to send troops to China. Hanuman Sahai, a well-known veteran of the Congress Party in his eighties, told reporters that in the past, Gandhi and Sun Yat-sen showed concern for each other in the two countries' movements for national independence. Sunderlal, chairman of the India-China Friendship Association, also told me that more than ten years ago, a newspaper in Allahabad edited a special collection on China's national movement. When Gandhi discovered this special collection, he finished reading it overnight with great enthusiasm. In addition, everyone knows that when Japanese imperialism invaded China, in Bombay, Nehru, the leader of the Indian national movement, enthusiastically called for support for China at a mass meeting, and the young Indian Communist Party member Kotnis was the first to respond and came to China. He gave his life for China's War of Resistance.

    Today, as India celebrates its independence and rebirth, and as huge crowds come to the Red Fort again to revel, waiting for Prime Minister Nehru to raise the flag, I, a Chinese reporter, join the friendly Indian people in celebrating India's Independence Day, deeply feeling the great pulse of the Indian people beating strongly, and feeling how abundant the potential of these kind, hardworking, resilient, and ambitious Indian people is.

    Today, no one can infringe upon their hard-won independence again. They have lived through humiliation, and today they have taken control of their own destiny, and they will also win the future. In the Indian national anthem they sing today, written by the great poet Tagore, I see their majestic image and magnificent vision: "You, the determiner of India's destiny, victory will surely belong to you!"

    印度独立十年
    高梁
    十年前8月15日德里的一个雨季的清晨，人群像冲出堤坝的激流涌向古老的红堡。尼赫鲁在这里把标志独立的印度共和国三色国旗第一次地徐徐升入高空。这时，举国响彻了狂欢独立的钟声。
    距今整整一百年前，这里也发生过一桩大事。不堪英国人压迫的在密拉特英军中的印籍士兵举行了暴动，在5月10日的星夜里冲入德里，并在红堡上竖起了起义的旗帜。红堡，这个古代帝王的宫殿，从此就成了印度独立和胜利的象征。
    差不多每个二十岁以上的印度人都清清楚楚记得，在十年前8月14日的午夜，在时钟敲了十二下并宣布了8月15日的开始之后，英国统治者无可奈何地把政权交给了印度的制宪议会。
    一位印度记者曾对我描述了当时他所看到的情景。8月14日天刚一黑的时候，一个个穿起新的纱丽的妇女，在自己的门前和屋檐下点起了泥制的排列在一起的千万盏小油灯，彻夜地等候着吉祥的消息。从四乡而来的成千成万的人群，涌过贾木纳河大桥，唱着歌，喊着口号，向德里挺进。举着大旗的工人队伍和驾着铁甲汽车的士兵们在制宪议会大厅的前面汇合。公务员第一次领到自己政府的薪金，他们也来到这里。广场上和人身上撒满了玫瑰的花瓣和各色各样热带的花朵。成群的学生也从那边走来，前面几个人的肩上背着一个用稻草扎成的死尸，上面贴着“帝国主义”四个大字。他们在为帝国主义举行葬礼，大声地喊着：“帝国主义死啦！”“独立万岁！”
    现在是第十个8月15日。独立的印度人民在庆祝印度独立十周年，也在庆祝印度独立战争的一百周年。他们每个人的脸上流露着崇高的骄傲和喜悦，同时也像在沉思着那永远不能忘记的过去的悲惨命运。
    如果你提起过去印度被奴役的时代，每个正直的人都会感到辛酸和悲愤。印度，这个被称为“黄金之鸟”、“人类谷仓”的地方，曾经到处是大米、牛奶、蜂蜜、黄油的富饶国度，但自从英国殖民者在这里创办了东印度公司，并且在普拉西战争后用刀剑正式建立起统治以来，它就变得难以想像的贫穷困苦，勤劳、善良的印度人民受到世上最大的侮辱和不平。
    一百年前的独立战争，就是印度广大农民、手工业者、士兵及一些封建王公不能忍耐这种剥削压迫而暴发的第一次大规模的起义。由密拉特士兵燃起的第一颗暴动的火花迅速地蔓延到北印度的平原。恒河掀起了风暴。起义英雄唐提亚·都庇的军队像雄鹰一样地驰骋在恒河两岸。英勇果敢的詹西王妃拉克什米·巴依在千军万马中坚强奋战，当敌人进攻她的战略要塞卡尔比时，她带领士兵，用双手捧起贾木纳河中的圣水，向祖国宣誓：
    “只要我们还活着，就决不放弃卡尔比。
    我们决不用自己的手埋葬我们的独立！”
    今年5月10日，当德里人民首次纪念这次独立战争的时候，记者曾亲自看到印度人民对这些起义英雄们的悼念，听他们叙述从老人那里传下来的关于起义的故事。他们永不忘记，起义失败后的黑暗的年代，那些从阿拉哈巴到康波尔的几百里的道路上几乎每棵树上都吊着的起义人民的尸体。记者亲自看到，老德里的克什米尔城门上至今还有英国侵略者在反攻德里时留下的累累弹痕。在新老德里之间的叫作“流血之门”的城堡下，成群的人们前来悼念，演讲。在当时成百成千爱国志士被惨杀的老德里中心建迪桥，许多人在詹西王妃和都庇等起义英雄的画像前留恋凭吊。其中的一个观众对我说：“他们都是印度人民敬爱的英雄，在英国统治时，历史上从来没有他们的名字，只是在今天印度独立后他们才被记载在我们的历史中。”
    从印度各阶层人们的谈话中知道，他们永不忘记1908年领导民族运动的国大党急进派领袖铁拉克如何为了要求印度完全独立而被监禁了六年的事实，永不忘记1919年阿姆利则的群众在集会时被无辜枪杀的两个人。人们的心里怀念着他们爱戴的领袖、圣雄甘地，他为印度的独立从这个村镇走到另一个村镇，号召和组织广大的群众，以非暴力和不合作的抵抗，来反对英国统治者。一直到1946年，当在英国皇家海军服役的印度水兵吹起起义的号角，在英国军舰上挂起了国大党和印度共产党的旗帜时，加尔各答的工人阶级举行了总罢工，支持他们的水兵兄弟。起义、罢工、罢税、不合作等等巨大的群众斗争，终于使得英国统治者在1947年被迫地退出了印度的土地。
    今天，当同任何印度朋友谈起这段可歌可泣的漫长斗争的历史时，你会感到，他们多么珍惜独立的果实，同时又对未来怀抱着多么美好的渴望。在他们面前，殖民者统治的时代和痛苦辛酸的旅程永不复返地结束了，新的时代和新的旅程却正在开始。
    独立的印度还很年轻。十年来，它在殖民者遗留下的充满饥饿、贫困、不平等和分割现象的困难条件下，建设自己的新生活。那封建王公割据统治的五百五十四个土邦已经统一起来，它们已不再在地图上出现而成为历史上的史迹；地主收税制也废除了，几千年来传袭下来的种姓制度和五千五百万“不可接触者”遭受的悲惨命运，也正在逐步地革除和变更。印度正在建造着巨大的工厂、工程、住宅、医院和学校，并在蕴藏丰富的地下探索宝藏。英国人在印度统治了二百年间，印度在钢的年产量方面总共不过八十九万吨，但独立后不到十年，它在1956年钢的年产量已经达到一百三十四万吨。在纺织业方面，它已经从1947年的年产量三十七亿六千二百万码增加到1956年的五十三亿零七百万码。在水利灌溉方面，在1950—1951年时印度全国灌溉面积仅是五千一百万英亩，而到1961年第二个五年计划结束时就要达到八千八百万英亩。
    但是，在印度，要想在短短的十年内医好过去二百年来英国统治者留下来的、比任何战争灾害都严重得多的创伤，要让人民在短期内吃饱、穿暖、住下房子，却是件极为复杂和艰巨的事。印度人民知道，要想建设起自己独立的国家，就必须警惕地防止殖民主义的重来，必须保持自己的独立和支持其他国家的独立，必须要一个国际的和平环境，与各国和平共处，互相来往和学习。在亚洲他们找到了一个曾经有过类似的悲惨命运的中国兄弟。
    谈起中印两国人民的关系，印度人和中国人都很知道，虽然他们所走过的独立的道路不同，现在的社会制度不同，但他们过去在为反对殖民主义、为独立解放斗争中却为共同的命运紧紧地联系着。当今年5月间德里人民纪念独立战争一百年之际，印度的历史学家曾谈论着在中国同时发生的太平天国运动。有一位历史学家、报纸主编维蒂亚兰卡，他的双目已经失明，但仍然热情地在研究太平天国运动。他说：印中两国人民在过去反对帝国主义的斗争中是互相支持的，正是由于印度发生了独立战争，英帝国主义不得不把派到中国去的军队迅速撤回，改变了出兵中国的计划。八十岁左右的国大党著名元老哈努曼·萨海曾对记者谈到，在过去两国争取民族独立的运动，甘地和孙中山先生曾如何互相表示关心。印中友好协会主席森德拉尔也对我说过，十几年前阿拉哈巴一家报纸编辑了一本有关中国民族运动的专集，当甘地发现这本专集后，他怀着满腔热情，连夜地把它看完。此外，大家还都知道，当日本帝国主义侵略中国时，在孟买，印度民族运动的领袖尼赫鲁在一次群众大会上热情地号召支援中国，而年青的印度共产党的儿子柯棣华第一个响应报名，来到中国。他为了中国的抗战捐出了生命。
    今天，当印度庆祝它的独立和新生，当巨大的人流又来到红堡前狂欢，等候着尼赫鲁总理升旗。我，一个中国的记者，同友好的印度人民一起来欢度印度的独立节日，深深地感到印度人民伟大的脉搏在强烈的跳动，感到这些善良、勤劳、具有坚韧毅力和远大理想的印度人民具有如何充沛的潜力。
    今天谁也不能再侵犯他们获得的独立了。他们屈辱地生活过来，在今天掌握了自己的命运，他们也将赢得未来。在他们今天所歌唱的，由伟大诗人泰戈尔所写的印度国歌中，我看到他们雄伟的形象和宏伟壮阔的远景：“你，印度命运的决定者，胜利一定属于你！”
