Behind the "Grass and Trees" Essays
By Our Correspondent Yao Dan

Although Liu Shahe's "Grass and Trees" essays are already notorious, the rightists are doing their utmost to prettify them, saying they are a "fragrant flower" released in response to the call of the Party Central Committee. In Sichuan literary circles, a large group of rightists, led by Shi Tianhe (i.e., Zhou Tianzhe, editor of "Stars") and including Liu Shahe (member, editor of "Stars"), Bai Hang (Party member, director of the "Stars" editorial department), Qiu Yuan (i.e., Qiu Yang, cadre of the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles), Chu Yitian (member, editor of "Grassland"), Chen Qian (i.e., Qianzi, "Grassland"), Yao Pan ("Grassland"), Bai Di (editor of "Lyric Creation"), Xiao Feng (i.e., Huang Zerong, editor of Chengdu Daily), Xu Hang (i.e., Xu Rongzhong, student of Chengdu Second Normal School), were indeed enthusiastically "responding" to the call of the Party Central Committee, striving to implement the policy of letting a hundred "flowers" bloom! "Grass and Trees" is merely one of them.

        × × ×

"Stars" was founded in January of this year. As early as before its founding, Shi Tianhe, Liu Shahe, and Bai Hang secretly plotted to use "Stars" to carry out an anti-Party conspiracy. The direction they set for "Stars" was: not to take the "celebrity route," in order to exclude progressive poets, but to cultivate a batch of "authors" according to their anti-Party intentions; "manuscripts should not mechanically coordinate with politics," thereby attempting to publish their anti-socialist works on a large scale. Shi Tianhe wrote a call for submissions that openly rejected socialist realism works. Under the guidance of this blatant anti-Party program, the first issue of "Stars" featured "Grass and Trees" and another bad poem, "Kiss."

After "Grass and Trees" was criticized this spring, they secretly plotted to adopt various despicable means to launch a frantic attack on the Party. Almost all of this large group of rightists wrote "anti-criticism" articles full of abuse and attacks, submitting them to various newspapers and periodicals. Some of these articles even wrote: "The false crown is about to be taken off, and the tiger-skin chair is about to be unstable!" They also cursed the critics as "old pimps from brothels." When these articles were not published, they planned to print them secretly and distribute them throughout the country. Another vicious method they adopted was to continue spreading poison in "Stars," deciding to publish more anti-Party satirical poems and poems promoting decadence and sorrow. Liu Shahe threatened to write a "Insects" series, clamoring: "You're afraid? I'll do it later (i.e., in the future)!"

At this time, their only fear was losing the anti-Party base of "Stars." So they spread rumors: "'Stars' is being besieged!" "The world isn't in chaos yet, but Sichuan is already!" Bai Hang also discussed with Liu Shahe, writing letters to friends in various places, asking them to defend and praise "Stars" and "Grass and Trees" in newspapers and periodicals.

          × × ×

The anti-Party activities of this group of rightists are by no means limited to "Stars," nor did they begin after "Grass and Trees" was criticized.

After the Hungarian incident last year, the activities of this anti-Party group were particularly rampant. Some openly said: "We here are the Petőfi Club." Shi Tianhe shouted: "We must kill people!" "If I were in Hungary, I would also take up arms!" He also cursed: "Now Communist Party members are all officials, with everyone having beautiful wives and concubines. One day when the world is in chaos, the isolated gang of dogs will collapse immediately!" Liu Shahe also shouted: "How wonderful it is to live in a capitalist country now!" Qiu Yuan (who was previously expelled from the Communist Youth League) even slandered "Chairman Mao as a personal hero."

In addition to this blatant attack, they also dressed themselves up as "believers in Marxism-Leninism," attacking the Party under the "banner" of anti-dogmatism. From the leaders of the Central Propaganda Department, the Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Department to the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, from many Chinese writers to Soviet writers, as well as everyone who had criticized "Grass and Trees" and them, were all falsely accused of being "dogmatists" and attacked one by one.

Bai Hang was a loyal mole of this anti-Party group within the Party. After the first issue of "Stars" was published, Li Lei, the secretary of the Party branch of the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, told him his views on "Grass and Trees" and the opinions of the Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Department leaders on "Kiss," reminding this "Stars" Party member to pay attention. However, he secretly reported this situation to Shi, Liu, and others, and also repeatedly distorted the internal situation of the Party and spread it among Shi, Liu, and others, providing them with anti-Party materials. When the anti-Party activities of Shi, Liu, and others aroused people's anger and they were criticized, Bai Hang said at the meeting that they were "working hard" and "doing it to improve their work." When Liu Shahe threateningly shouted: "If you interfere with me, I'll strike! I'll rebel!" Bai Hang also strongly proposed to the leaders: "If you continue to criticize, I won't do it anymore!" Someone wrote materials exposing Shi Tianhe's reactionary remarks and submitted them to him for the Party organization to refer to, but he privately withheld them and never handed them over.

         × × ×

Under the just counterattack of the masses, the reactionary arrogance has apparently declined. The ringleader Shi Tianhe has also retreated to Mount Emei to "bury himself in creation." But as the rightist Xu Hang said: "Silence is not depression, silence is ammunition being loaded into the barrel and chamber!"

Sure enough, in May of this year, during the rectification symposium held by the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Liu Shahe came forward to appeal for "Stars," "Grass and Trees," and the anti-Party group. He described the criticism of "Grass and Trees" as being "besieged," and the criticism of their reactionary remarks and deeds as being "attacked from inside and outside." He also slanderously claimed that he had suffered "political persecution" and that "freedom of correspondence was also restricted." Qiu Yuan, Chu Yitian, Xiao Feng, and others also echoed each other at the symposium, accusing the Sichuan literary and art circles of having a combination of dogmatism and sectarianism, and that the root cause was the Provincial Party Committee.

It turned out that Shi Tianhe had arranged before leaving: now you can be silent, and speak when the time is right. The content of the speeches at the symposium, who to praise? Who to attack? When to participate or not participate in the symposium, etc., Liu Shahe, Qiu Yuan, Xiao Feng, and others had secretly discussed in advance.

At this time, Xu Hang, who had been hiding in the shadows, constantly wrote letters to Liu Shahe. In the letter, he called himself: "Before I knew Mr. Shi (Shi Tianhe), my shooting was blind and scattered. In the future, I will have a planned and purposeful concentrated shooting." After Liu Shahe spoke at the symposium, Xu Hang was very happy and wrote to Liu Shahe saying: "Your counterattack is known. This shot was well fired, fierce and bold." But he immediately warned Liu Shahe: "If you get an inch, you will take a mile, forgetting the strategy of 'stopping at the right time,' you will definitely fall into the trap of 'luring the enemy in deep.'"

Shi Tianhe, who was already deeply hidden in Mount Emei, also built a "command post" on the mountain. On the one hand, he wrote articles for Wenhui Bao, shouting "Late Spring in Jin City"; on the other hand, he gathered rightists from other places to write articles for newspapers and write speeches for the Sichuan Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles symposium to abuse and attack; at the same time, he also directed the activities of the anti-Party group according to the reports of Liu Shahe and others. When he saw that Qiu Yuan's speech had not followed his instructions of "not to broaden the scope" and attacked non-Party members, he wrote to Liu Shahe saying: "Avoid just pursuing venting anger and losing public sympathy." He also instructed: "We should put forward more constructive opinions, combining the exposure of contradictions with putting forward constructive opinions, so that there will be less resistance." At the same time, he wrote a ten-thousand-word letter, asking Liu Shahe to read it at the symposium.

His ten-thousand-word letter was an anti-Party program that attacked from the Party's fundamental principles and policies. Liu Shahe dared not read it after reading it. He replied to Shi, saying: "You are far away in the depths of the white clouds, and you don't understand the climate in the mortal world... What will happen if your earth-shattering bomb explodes? ... They will beat you with sticks three times more fiercely than they beat Qiu Yuan. Because your bomb is more powerful than his atomic bomb, it is a hydrogen bomb." But Shi Tianhe believed that Liu Shahe was boosting others' morale and undermining his own prestige, and wrote back saying: "We cannot believe in the benevolence and grace of the tyrant, but only in the power of struggle." He still wanted Liu Shahe to quickly release that "hydrogen bomb."

It was not until the people of the whole country began to refute the rightist remarks that Shi Tianhe realized that the situation was not "good," and immediately burned a batch of letters, and asked Liu Shahe to send back the ten-thousand-word letter to be rewritten. He also instructed Liu Shahe and others: "The struggle must continue... I hope you remain optimistic... Do not completely adopt a withdrawal attitude."

                × × ×

Behind this anti-Party group stood two well-known rightist generals, one of whom was Zhang Mosheng (member of the China Democratic League, director of the Chinese Department of Sichuan University).

Zhang Mosheng is not unfamiliar to people. More than twenty years ago, when he was the principal of Jinan Middle School, he attacked the revolutionary writer Hu Yepin, forcing him to leave the school. Later, he expelled progressive students. He is the author of the biography of Li Zongwu, the master of "Thick Black Theory," and also wrote a preface to the "Biography of Wu Xun." After liberation, he became a favorite of the rightists of the China Democratic League. Luo Longji and Fei Xiaotong came to Chengdu and talked to him, and Pan Dakui first went to his home to visit him as soon as he arrived at Sichuan University.

After the start of the rectification, Zhang Mosheng, who was called by Shi Tianhe as having a strong sense of "justice," finally stood up and spoke. On the one hand, he set fires at Sichuan University, saying: "This rectification is a test for Chairman Mao and others. If it is not rectified well, the Communist Party will be finished if there is any disturbance in the international arena." On the other hand, at the symposium of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, he spoke out for Liu Shahe and Shi Tianhe. First, he popped up the fallacy of "poems have no fixed interpretations," saying that poems cannot have a fixed interpretation, and it is best for the author to annotate them, to defend "Grass and Trees." Then he aggressively questioned the Party, maliciously asking: "Why publish so many articles blocking the literary and art policy (referring to articles criticizing Grass and Trees)?" "Why should Liu Shahe be struggled against for several days in a row?" "Is it to let a hundred flowers bloom? Or to leave no grass growing?" "The Stars poetry journal is a young sprout that has just emerged from the soil, why should the leadership give it ruthless destruction?"

The other is Fan Yan (also known as Huan Bangxian, member of the China Democratic League, reporter of Wenhui Bao stationed in Sichuan).

When the rectification had just begun, when Liu Shahe, Qiu Yuan, and others, according to prior agreement, did not participate in the symposium, and were still looking up at the sky, waiting for the "climate to improve," Fan Yan came to visit Liu Shahe. He wrote the notorious "Liu Shahe Talks About 'Grass and Trees'." Then Fan Yan went through Liu Shahe to find Bai Hang, and clearly proposed to Bai Hang that the purpose of visiting him was to find out some "internal news" from his mouth as "internal reference." He asked Bai Hang: "Is the criticism of Grass and Trees more good or bad?" Bai replied: "More bad, ... I don't see any problem with Grass and Trees..." Fan then said: "I didn't see anything when I read Grass and Trees!"

When people began to pursue the reactionary remarks and deeds of the rightists, Fan Yan colluded with Zhang Mosheng, Liu Shahe, and others to counterattack. Fan Yan distorted and reported Li Lei's speech exposing Liu Shahe's slanderous "political persecution," Liu Shahe adopted a new tactic of refusing to attend the symposium, and telegraphed it to Wenhui Bao, falsely accusing "Liu Shahe is unwilling to attend the Grass and Trees symposium, so it is one-sided, Li Lei's speech avoids talking about certain issues, forming a new siege." Later, the anti-Party group's conspiracy was gradually exposed, Shi Tianhe, Liu Shahe, and others felt that the "situation was gone," but Fan Yan was still clamoring in Chengdu, and threatened: "Isn't there anything shameful about Chang Sumin and Li Lei of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles? If we really do it, we will bring out the materials!"

                    × × ×

The conspiracies and tricks of the anti-Party group headed by Shi Tianhe have been revealed. Liu Shahe, Bai Hang, and others have been forced to make some confessions, but they are not thorough enough, especially Shi Tianhe, who has not honestly made a good confession. The struggle against these rightists in Sichuan's literary and art circles is still continuing.

    在“草木篇”的背后
    本报记者  姚丹
    流沙河所写的“草木篇”虽然早已臭名远扬，但右派分子们却极力为它搽脂抹粉，说它是响应党中央的号召而放出来的一朵“香花”。在四川文艺界中，以石天河（即周天哲、“星星”编辑）为首，包括流沙河（团员、“星星”编辑）白航（党员、“星星”编辑部主任）丘原（即丘漾、省文联干部）、储一天（团员、“草地”编辑）陈谦（即茜子、“草地”编辑）、遥攀（“草地”编辑）、白堤（“歌词创作”编辑）、晓枫（即黄泽荣、成都日报编辑）、徐航（即徐荣忠、成都第二师范学校学生）等一大群右派分子，确实是在那里热烈“响应”党中央的号召，努力实行百“花”齐放哩！“草木篇”不过是其中的一朵而已。
        ×  ×  ×        
      “星星”创刊于今年1月。早在创刊以前，石天河、流沙河和白航就秘密策划好了通过“星星”进行反党的阴谋。他们给“星星”规定的方向是：不走“名人路线”，借以排斥进步诗人，要按照他们的反党意图，另外培植一批“作者”；“稿件不要机械配合政治”，从而企图大登其反社会主义的作品。石天河又据此写了公然排斥社会主义现实主义作品的稿约。在这种露骨的反党纲领指导下，“星星”的第一期就出现了“草木篇”和另一首坏诗“吻”。
    今年春季，“草木篇”受到批评以后，他们又密谋采取各种卑劣手段，向党发动猖狂的进攻。这一大群右派分子差不多都写了充满谩骂攻击的“反批评”文章，投到各报刊。其中有的文章甚至写道：“虚假的王冠快被摘下来了，虎皮交椅快要坐不稳了！”又骂批评者是“妓院的老嫖客”。这些文章未被刊登，他们又打算秘密印刷，散发到全国。他们另一个恶毒的办法就是在“星星”上继续放毒。决定以后更要多发表反党的讽刺诗和宣扬颓废、哀愁的诗。流沙河扬言还要写“昆虫篇”，他叫嚣：“你怕，老子二天（即以后的意思）还要干！”
    这时候，他们唯一恐惧的是怕失去“星星”这块反党的地盘。所以大放谣言：“‘星星’受到围剿哪！”“天下未乱蜀先乱！”白航还和流沙河商量，向各地朋友写信，要他们在报刊上为“星星”和“草木篇”辩解、吹捧。
          ×  ×  ×  
    这一群右派分子的反党活动决不止于“星星”，也决不是从“草木篇”受到批评以后才开始的。
    去年匈牙利事件以后，这个反党集团的活动特别嚣张。有的公开说：“我们这里就是裴多菲俱乐部”。石天河嚷出：“要杀人！”“要是我在匈牙利，也会拿起枪杆来的！”又骂：“现在共产党员个个做官、人人娇妻美妾，有一天天下大乱，孤群狗党一下就倒过去了！”流沙河也叫喊：“现在到资本主义国家去生活多好啊！”丘原（过去被开除出共青团）甚至诬蔑“毛主席是个人英雄主义”。
    除了这种露骨的攻击外，他们还把自己打扮成“马列主义的信奉者”，在反教条主义的“义旗”下来攻击党。从中央宣传部、省委宣传部到省文联的负责人，从许多中国作家到苏联作家，以及所有批评过“草木篇”和他们的人，都一律被他们诬指为“教条主义者”，而一一加以攻击。
    白航是这个反党集团在党内的忠实坐探。“星星”创刊号出版后，省文联党支部书记李累将自己对“草木篇”的看法同省委宣传部负责人对“吻”的意见告诉他，提醒这位“星星”的党员注意。他却将这一情况向石、流等人密报，还数次将党内情况歪曲地在石、流等人中散播，供给他们反党的材料。当石、流等的反党活动激起人们的愤怒，纷纷给以批驳时，白航却在会上说他们“工作努力”、“是为了搞好工作”。当流沙河威胁地叫嚣：“干涉老子，老子就罢工！老子就造反！”时，白航也向领导强硬提出：“再批评下去就不干了！”有人写了揭发石天河反动言行的材料，交他供党组织参考，他却私自扣下，一直不交出来。
         ×  ×  ×           
    在群众的正义反击下，反动气焰表面上是下降了。魁首石天河也退避到峨嵋山去“埋头搞创作”去了。但这正如右派分子徐航所说：“缄默并非消沉，缄默是弹药正在装进炮膛和枪膛！”
    果然，今年五月，在省文联召开整风座谈会期间，流沙河就出面为“星星”“草木篇”，为反党集团喊冤。把对“草木篇”的批评说成受到“围剿”，把对他们反动言行的批判说成受到“内外夹攻”。又含血喷人地说遭到“政治陷害”，“通信自由也被限制了”。丘原、储一天、晓枫等也在座谈会上异口同声地指责四川文艺界中有着教条主义和宗派主义相结合的统治，而且根源于省委。
    原来石天河在走前就布置过：现在可以沉默，时候到了再说。座谈会上的发言内容，捧谁？打击谁？何时参加或不参加座谈会等问题，事先流沙河、丘原、晓枫等都暗地商量好了。
    这时候，一直躲在阴暗处的徐航，不断给流沙河写信。信上他自称：“未识石先生（石天河）之前，我的射击是盲目的，分散的，今后，我将有计划有目的地集中射击。”流沙河在座谈会上发言后，徐航大为高兴，给流沙河来信说：“你的反击已经知悉。这一炮打得还好，猛烈而且泼辣。”但他立即告诫流沙河：“如果你得步进尺，忘记‘适可而止’的战略，你一定会中‘诱敌深入’之计。”
    已经深藏在峨嵋山中的石天河，也在山上搭好了“司令台”。他一面写文章给文汇报，大喊“锦城春晚”；一面又纠集别地的右派分子给报纸写文章、给四川省文联座谈会写发言稿谩骂攻击；同时还根据流沙河等人的汇报指挥反党集团的活动。他见到丘原发言中未遵循他的“不要扯宽了”的指示而攻击了党外人士，即写信给流沙河说：“切忌只追求泄愤，失去群众同情。”又指示：“应多提建设性意见，把揭露矛盾结合在提建设性意见里面，这样就可以使阻力少些。”同时他写来了万言书，要流沙河在座谈会上宣读。
    他的万言书是一个从党的根本原则、政策上加以攻击的反党纲领。流沙河看了不敢宣读。回信给石说：“你远在白云深处，太不了解凡尘间的气候……你那一颗震天地的炸弹如果爆了，会产生什么结果？……。他们会以比打丘原更猛三倍的棍子打你。因为你那颗炸弹比他的原子弹更有威力，是氢弹。”而石天河却认为流沙河在长他人志气，灭自己威风，又来信说：“不能相信暴君的仁慈和恩典，而只能相信斗争的力量。”他仍然要流沙河赶快放出那颗“氢弹”。
    直到全国人民开始对右派言论进行驳斥时，石天河才认为大势不“好”，立即烧毁了一批信件，叫流沙河把万言书寄回，拟重新改写。他又指示流沙河等说：“斗争是必须继续的……希望你保持乐观，……不要完全采取退出的态度。”
                ×  ×  ×  
    在这个反党集团的背后，站着两个赫赫有名的右派将军，其中一个就是张默生（盟员、四川大学中文系主任）。
    提起张默生人们倒不是陌生的。二十几年前，他在济南中学当校长时，就打击过革命作家胡也频，逼他离开学校。以后又开除过进步学生。他是“厚黑学”教主李宗吾传记的作者，也为“武训画传”写过序言。解放后就成为民盟右派的得宠分子，罗隆基、费孝通来成都都找他谈过话，潘大逵一到四川大学就首先要去他家拜访。
    整风开始后，被石天河称为富有“正义感”的张默生终于站出来说话了。他一面在四川大学放火，说：“这次整风对毛主席等人都是一个考验。整不好，国际间一有风吹草动，共产党就完了。”一面又在文联的座谈会上，为流沙河、石天河大鸣不平。首先弹出“诗无达诂”的滥调，说诗不能有一种固定的解释，最好让作者注解，为“草木篇”作辩护。接着他就向党大兴问罪之师，恶意地质问：“为什么要刊载那么多阻塞文艺方针的文章（指批评草木篇的文章）？”“为什么要把流沙河一连斗争几天？”“是要让百花齐放呢？还是让寸草不生？”“星星诗刊是刚出土的幼芽，为什么领导上要给以无情的摧残？”
    另一个就是范琰（又名宦邦显，盟员、文汇报驻四川记者）。
    整风刚开始，当流沙河、丘原等人根据事先约定，没有参加座谈会，还在一旁翘首望天，等待“气候好转”的时候，范琰前来拜访流沙河。写了那篇臭名昭著的“流沙河谈‘草木篇’”。接着范琰又通过流沙河去找白航，而且向白航明白地提出访问他是要从他口中探听一些“内部消息”作为“内部参考”。他问白航：“批评草木篇是好作用多？坏作用多？”白答：“坏作用多，……没有看出草木篇有什么问题……”范接着说：“我看了草木篇也没有看出什么来！”
    当人们开始追击右派分子反动言行时，范琰又和张默生、流沙河等勾结一起进行反扑。范琰对于李累揭穿流沙河诬蔑的
  “政治陷害”真象的发言，流沙河采取了拒不出席座谈会的新战术，除又作了歪曲报道外，并以此打电报给文汇报，诬指“草木篇座谈会流沙河不愿出席，故一边倒，李累发言对某些问题避而不谈，形成新的围攻。”到后来反党集团阴谋逐渐暴露，石天河、流沙河等人都感到“大势已去”，范琰却仍然在成都叫嚣，并威胁地说：“文联常苏民、李累等人不是没有见不得人的事，要真干下去，就把材料端出来！”
                    ×  ×  ×
    以石天河为首的反党集团的阴谋诡计，已经昭然若揭。流沙河、白航等已被迫作了一些交代，但却很不彻底，尤其是石天河，仍未老老实实地很好交代。四川省文艺界对这些右派分子的斗争，仍在继续进行中。
