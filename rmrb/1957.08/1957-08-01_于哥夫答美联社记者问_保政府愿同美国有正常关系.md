Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, July 30th: The Chairman of the Bulgarian Council of Ministers, Yugov, recently answered questions posed to him in Bulgaria by Associated Press correspondent in Budapest, Hartman.

Regarding the question of Bulgarian relations with the United States, Yugov said that the Bulgarian side has repeatedly stated that the Bulgarian government is in favor of normal diplomatic relations with the United States. As everyone knows, the long-term interruption of diplomatic relations between Bulgaria and the United States is not due to our will or desire. The U.S. government, simply because the then-U.S. Minister to Sofia, Heath, was declared persona non grata, groundlessly used this as an excuse to sever diplomatic relations between the two countries. In this regard, it should not be forgotten that this measure against the U.S. Minister to Sofia was taken when the so-called "Cold War" against the countries of the socialist camp was at its height.

Speaking of cultural exchanges, Yugov replied that we do not see any serious obstacles to the restoration of normal diplomatic relations between Bulgaria and the United States. Once such relations are established, it will be possible to establish and develop extensive cultural ties.

    于哥夫答美联社记者问
    保政府愿同美国有正常关系
    据新华社索非亚30日电　保加利亚部长会议主席于哥夫最近回答了美联社驻布达佩斯记者哈特曼在保加利亚向他提出的问题。
    关于保加利亚同美国的关系问题，于哥夫说，保加利亚方面曾经再三声明，保加利亚政府赞成同美国有正常的外交关系。大家知道，保美两国长期中断外交关系这种情况，并不是由于我们的意志和愿望。美国政府仅仅因为当时的美国驻索非亚全权公使希思被宣布为“不受欢迎的人”，就毫无根据地以此作为口实，断绝了两国的外交关系。在这方面不应当忘记，对美国驻索非亚全权公使采取这种措施，是在反对社会主义阵营各国的所谓“冷战”正处于高潮的时候。
    谈到文化交流问题，于哥夫回答说，我们并不认为在恢复保美两国的正常外交关系方面有什么严重的障碍。这种关系一旦建立，就有可能建立和发展广泛的文化联系。
