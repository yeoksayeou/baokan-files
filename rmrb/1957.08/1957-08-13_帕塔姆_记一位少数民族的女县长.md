    Patam
    —A Record of a Female County Head of a Minority Nationality
    By Our Correspondent Shen Shi (Shěn Shí)
    I had passed through Kongsain (Kāngsài yīn) many times, each time grabbing a quick meal at the transportation canteen and then hurrying on. The wonderful scenery of the Tianshan Mountains could only be glimpsed through the car window, leaving me with a sense of longing. This July, I passed through this place again and stayed for a day, taking in the beautiful mountain scenery. Snow-capped peaks were shrouded in thin clouds; ancient spruces filled the mountains and valleys; clear streams flowed from the canyons, murmuring as they converged. On the banks of the streams, Kazakh yurts emitted wisps of smoke. Coming from the city, I felt refreshed to be in this quiet part of the Tianshan Mountains. But what made me even happier was meeting Comrade Patam here.

    I had gone to her house, but the door was locked. I inquired at the People's Committee of Suiding (Suídìng) County and was told that she had gone up the mountain to recuperate. Later, in a conversation with County Party Secretary Liu Fengqi (Liú Fèngqí), I learned where she was resting.

    We arrived at Kongsain and found her yurt by the creek. When Patam saw the guests, she quickly made tea and brought out a carpet to spread on the shallow grass along the creek. Her husband, Tasmaihmaimaiti (Tǎxī màihé mǎimǎití), accompanied us as we sat on the carpet, drinking tea and chatting. Patam and her eldest daughter, Shajidai (Shā Jídài), were busy preparing a meal for us. Shajidai, who is thirteen years old and a fourth-grade student, wearing a red scarf and long riding boots, walked with her green dress fluttering in the wind. While Tasmaihmaimaiti was talking, the second daughter, Halidai (Hā Lìdài), brought their youngest sister to their father. I saw that their five children were all neatly and cleanly dressed. Seeing how Patam respected her husband in everything, I imagined she must be a capable housewife at home.

    After the meal, Patam finally had time to chat with us. Although she had a chest ailment, she seemed to be in good spirits.

    She had just been elected as the deputy county head of Suiding County last year. Before that, she served as the director of the County Women's Federation for four years. She lived among the women, and whenever she went somewhere, many women would come to her, asking her to solve their personal problems. It was the same when she returned to the county seat. Those who lived too far to return home would stay at her house. The women jokingly said, "Patam's house has become our inn."

    When Suiding County was piloting the first batch of agricultural cooperatives, many women did not understand the benefits of agricultural collectivization and held their husbands back. They worried that after the dairy cows joined the cooperative, they would not be able to find milk for their milk tea, that they would not be able to freely visit relatives after joining the cooperative, and that their daughters' future marriages would be interfered with by the cooperative.

    The permanent mutual aid team led by farmer Yibulayin (Yībùlāyīn) in Erxiang (Èrxiāng) of Sanqu (Sānqū) was preparing to establish a cooperative. When Yibulayin's wife heard that her husband was going to join the cooperative, she sold thirty chickens and a mare, and hid the newly sewn quilt and several lambs at her relatives' house. One day, Patam came to her house, and Gu'anhan (Gǔ'ānhán) asked her, "After the agricultural cooperative is established, will the two rooms I live in have to join the cooperative?" Gu'anhan then took out a package of new clothes and asked, "These are sewn for my daughter, do they also have to join the cooperative?" After Patam explained the policy of agricultural collectivization to her, Gu'anhan's concerns were dispelled, and she revealed her true feelings. She said, "My house, dairy cows... were all earned by my husband through hard work. I worry that after joining the agricultural cooperative, these things will no longer belong to us." She regretted selling the chickens and the mare, and regretted that she should not have hidden the clothes and lambs at her relatives' house.

    The diligent Uyghur women managed the daily household chores, and they did not have the habit of participating in field production. After the agricultural cooperative was established, it was not easy to mobilize them to engage in this work. Especially the elderly and families with children had many concerns. They were unwilling for women to show their faces in public and worried that if mothers went to the fields to work, there would be no one to take care of the children at home. Extensive publicity had been carried out in various townships, but the hidden resistance was still considerable. Zuoren (Zuǒrén) Khan, a member of the Guangmingzhilu (Guāngmíng zhī lù) Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Suiding, had two children. When she joined the cooperative, she agreed with her mother-in-law that she would go to work and let her mother-in-law take care of the children during the day. However, every time she came back from work, she saw that the children were not taken care of and the meal was not cooked. Zuoren Khan ran to the Women's Federation to complain to Patam. Patam went to her house, and her mother-in-law also complained, saying, "I cook for her and take care of the children every day, I am not her long-term worker." Patam used the deeds of Hairiqi (Hǎilìqí) Khan of the Heping (Hépíng) Cooperative in Yixiang (Yīxiāng) of Wuqu (Wǔqū) to enlighten her. Hairiqi Khan's daughter-in-law, Hairensha (Hǎirénshā) Khan, was the youth production team leader in the cooperative and had five children. Her mother-in-law patiently took care of her grandchildren, allowing her daughter-in-law to concentrate on production. As a result, Hairensha Khan was selected as a labor model and went to Beijing to attend the National Congress of Active Builders of Socialism. Patam said to Zuoren Khan's mother-in-law, "You and Hairiqi Khan are both mothers-in-law, and she has more grandchildren than you. Can't you do what Hairiqi Khan can do?" After her persuasion, Zuoren Khan's mother-in-law also changed her mind. Patam also helped the women in the agricultural cooperative to form childcare groups, which solved the difficulties of the mothers, and the male members of the cooperative were also very satisfied.

    Patam worked in the Women's Federation for four years and traveled to every village in the county. The farmers were all familiar with her and knew that she had done many things for the women. At the county People's Congress held in December 1956, she was elected as the deputy county head.

    A woman becoming the deputy county head was unprecedented in the nine counties of the Ili River Valley, and it quickly spread among the farmers. Patam was a little timid. The burden was heavy, could she carry it? She wrote a letter to County Party Secretary Liu Fengqi, requesting that he consider re-electing someone else. Comrade Liu Fengqi comforted her, encouraged her, and told her to be bold and carry on. He said to Patam, "There are four deputy county heads in the county People's Committee, and the work can be appropriately divided. At the same time, you are also a member of the county committee, and for important matters, you can submit them to the county committee for research in advance."

    Once, Patam came back from the countryside, and her daughter Shajidai asked, "Mom! Are you scared now that you are the deputy county head?"

    Patam smiled and said, "How can I not be scared! Secretary Liu told me that as long as I rely on the masses in everything, all difficulties can be solved."

    In June of this year, the farmland in Suiding County was hit by drought. Liang Guojin (Liáng Guójìn), the deputy director of the Rural Work Department of the CPC Ili Prefecture Committee, came from Yining (Yīníng). He requested that farmers in the drought-stricken areas water the fields at night to reduce excessive evaporation of moisture. After Patam understood the benefits of watering at night, she led a work team to the Meli (Měilì) Agricultural Cooperative in Qilibake (Qílìbākè) Township, calling on farmers to water the fields at night. However, the farmers were only used to watering during the day. They said, "This female county head is really fierce, she doesn't even let us off at night." Patam explained to them why they should water at night. That night, she and the comrades in the work team helped the agricultural cooperative to irrigate 120 mu of land. Seeing the female county head taking the lead in hard work, everyone acted and rescued a part of the drought-stricken wheat fields.

    When Patam recounted her childhood experiences to us, she pointed to Halidai, who was wearing a red scarf, and said, "This generation of children is so lucky. When I was her age, I was still wandering on the streets!"

    When she was four years old, her parents died one after another, and she was raised by her grandmother. Three years later, her grandmother also died, and she was left wandering the streets. A neighbor took pity on her and temporarily took her in. At the age of nine, she was sent to an orphanage school, but this elementary school only provided clothes and books, not food and lodging. When she came back from school, she took care of the neighbor's children to get a meal. After finishing elementary school, she was admitted to Yining Normal School. Since the peaceful liberation of Xinjiang, the Party has cultivated her, enabling her to learn how to manage the affairs of the entire county from an elementary school teacher, changing the traditional view that many people had of women.

    As I bid farewell to her home and headed to the summer pasture in Suiding County, I passed by Sailimu Lake (Sàilǐmù Hú) and met an old Kazakh herdsman named Gu'anxibai (Gǔ'ān xībài). I asked him about Patam, and the old man Gu'anxibai said, "Patam? She is our good daughter, she knows more than us!"

    I went to the Altai Mountains, and along the way, I thought of Comrade Patam, her warm home, and the words of the old man Gu'anxibai, which reminded me of the short few years since the liberation of Xinjiang, how many working women of all ethnic groups in the vast rural areas north and south of the Tianshan Mountains have been freed from all kinds of constraints and are moving towards a new life, and what profound changes are taking place in people's hearts and emotions.

    帕塔姆
    ——记一位少数民族的女县长
    本报记者　沈石
    多次经过康赛因，每次在交通食堂吃上一顿饭，便匆匆地走了，那天山丛中奇妙的景色，只好隔着车上的玻璃窗瞧瞧，回想起来，不免有几分怅惘。今年7月，我再度路过这地方，逗留了一天，饱览了山峦秀色。积雪的高峰，薄云缭绕；古老的云杉，满山满谷；清澈的溪水，从峡谷中汇流过来，发出潺潺的声音，小溪两岸，哈萨克人的蒙古包，吐出缕缕青烟，我从城市来，到了这幽静的天山深处，心情为之一快，然而更使我高兴的，是在这里会见了帕塔姆同志。
    我曾经去过她的家，房门锁着。到绥定县人民委员会探问，说她上山养病去了。后来和县委书记刘凤岐同志交谈，才知道她养病的地方。
    我们到了康赛因，在小溪边上找着了她住的蒙古包。帕塔姆看到客人来访，赶忙烧茶，赶忙搬出地毯铺到沿溪的浅草上。她的丈夫塔西麦合买提陪着我们坐在地毯上，边喝茶边谈天。帕塔姆和她的大女儿莎吉黛又忙着给我们做饭。莎吉黛今年十三岁，小学四年级生，戴着红领巾，蹬着长统马靴，走起路来，绿色的衣裙随风飘动。塔西麦合买提正谈话间，二姑娘哈丽黛抱着最小的妹妹送到爸爸手中。我见到他们的五个儿女，都收拾得挺漂亮，挺干净，见到帕塔姆处处尊重她的丈夫，我窥想她在家中必定是一位贤能的主妇。
    用过饭，帕塔姆才来和我们攀谈，她胸部虽然有病，精神倒很愉快。
    她在去年才被选为绥定县副县长。这以前，她担任县妇联会主任四个年头。她和妇女们生活在一起，每到一处，总有许多妇女来找她，要求解决她们切身的问题。回到县城，也是这样，道远不能回去的，便留她们在她家歇宿。妇女们开玩笑地说：“帕塔姆的家变成了我们的客栈。”
    绥定县试办第一批农业社时，许多妇女不懂得农业合作化的好处，拉丈夫的后腿。她们担心奶牛入社后，喝奶茶，找不到牛奶，害怕入社后不能自由地和亲戚往还，顾虑女儿将来出嫁受到社的干预。
    三区二乡农民衣布拉音领导的常年互助组准备成立社，衣布拉音的妻子听到丈夫要入社，卖掉了三十只鸡和一匹母马，把新缝的棉被和几只羊羔寄藏到亲戚家里。一天，帕塔姆来到她家，古安汗问她：“农业社成立后，我住的两间房要入社吗？”古安汗又拿出一包新衣服来，问道：“这是给我女儿缝的，也要入社吗？”帕塔姆向她说明农业合作化的政策，古安汗顾虑消除之后，道出了她的真心话，她说：“我家的房屋、奶牛……都是我丈夫辛苦挣来的，我担心参加农业社后，这些东西便不归我们了。”她后悔卖掉了鸡和母马，后悔不应该把衣服和羊羔藏到亲戚家。
    勤劳的维吾尔族妇女，主持着日常的家务劳动，她们没有参加田间生产的习惯。农业社成立之后，要动员她们从事这项工作，并不是一件容易的事。特别是老年人和有小孩的家庭，顾虑很多。他们不愿妇女抛头露面，担心母亲到地里生产，小孩在家没有人照顾。各乡曾经进行了广泛的宣传，可是暗中的阻力仍然不小。绥定郊区光明之路农业社社员左仁汗，有两个小孩，她入社时，和婆婆谈好，自己去生产，让婆婆白天带小孩。可是她每次收工回来，看到小孩没有人管，饭也没有做好，左仁汗跑到妇联会，向帕塔姆诉苦。帕塔姆到了她家，她婆婆也诉起苦来，说：“每天给她做饭，带小孩，我又不是她的长工。”帕塔姆拿五区一乡和平社海立其汗的事迹来启发她。海立其汗的媳妇海仁沙汗是社里的青年生产队长，有五个小孩，她婆婆耐心地照管孙儿，让媳妇好好地生产，结果海仁沙汗被选为劳动模范，到过北京，出席过全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会，帕塔姆对左仁汗的婆婆说：“你和海立其汗同样是婆婆，她的孙子比你多，难道海立其汗能做到的事，你不能做吗？”经过她一番说服，左仁汗的婆婆也转变过来了。帕塔姆还帮助农业社的妇女，组成带娃娃小组，解决了母亲们的困难，男社员也很满意。
    帕塔姆在妇联会工作四年，走遍了全县每一个村庄，农民们都熟悉她，知道她替妇女做了许多事。在1956年12月召开的县人民代表大会会议上，她被选为副县长。
    一个女人当了副县长，这在伊犁河谷九个县中还是破天荒的事，它很快地在农民当中传遍开了。帕塔姆有些胆怯，担子重了，能挑得起吗？她写了一封信给县委书记刘凤岐同志，要求考虑改选别人。刘凤岐同志安慰她，鼓励她，嘱她放胆地干下去。他对帕塔姆说：“县人民委员会有正副县长四人，可以适当地分工，同时你又是县委会委员，有重大的事，可事先拿到县委会上研究。”
    一次，帕塔姆从乡下回来，她的女儿莎吉黛问道：“妈妈！你做了副县长，害怕吗？”
    帕塔姆笑了一笑，说：“怎不害怕哩！刘书记嘱咐我只要事事依靠群众，什么困难都可解决。”
    今年6月，绥定县农田受旱，中共伊犁区委员会农村工作部副部长梁国晋同志从伊宁赶来，他要求在受旱地区，让农民夜间浇水，减少水分过多的蒸发。帕塔姆弄明白了夜间浇水的好处后，率领一个工作组，前往奇里巴克乡美丽农业社，号召农民夜间浇水，可是农民只习惯白天浇水，他们说：“这位女县长真厉害，连晚上也不放过我们。”帕塔姆向他们讲解为什么要夜间浇水，当天晚上，她和工作组的同志帮助农业社浇地一百二十亩，农民们见到女县长带头苦干，大家都行动起来，抢救了一部分受旱的麦田。
    帕塔姆向我们叙述她童年时的遭遇时，指着戴红领巾的哈丽黛说：“她们这一代真幸福，我像她这般年龄时，还在街头流浪哩！”
    她四岁时，父母相继去世，归外祖母抚养，过了三年，外祖母又死去，她流落街头，邻居可怜她，暂时收留了她。到了九岁，送她进一所孤儿学校，可是这所小学只发给衣服和书籍文具，不供食宿。她放学归来，给邻居带小孩，混一口饭吃。念完小学，她考入伊宁师范学校，新疆和平解放以来，党培养她，使她从一位小学教师学会了管理全县的事务，改变了许多人轻视妇女的传统观念。
    当我告别她家，前往绥定县夏牧场，途经赛里木湖边，遇见一位年老的哈萨克牧民，他叫古安西拜，我向他问到帕塔姆，古安西拜老汉说：“帕塔姆吗？她是我们的好女儿，她比我们懂得多哩！”
    我去阿尔泰山，一路上，想起帕塔姆同志，想起她那温暖的家，想起古安西拜老人的话，使我联想到新疆解放后短短的几个年头，在天山南北的广大农村中，有多少各民族的劳动妇女，摆脱了种种束缚，走向新的生活，在人们的心里和情感上，又起着多么深刻的变化。（附图片）
