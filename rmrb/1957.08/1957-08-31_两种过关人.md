Two Kinds of People Crossing the Threshold
    Liu Bing

    History has pushed the threshold of socialism before us. All Chinese people, except those who are determined not to cross it, whether they want to or not, must cross this threshold. How to cross this threshold? Everyone must think about it.

    There are two kinds of people lined up before the threshold: one kind is those who really want to cross it; the other kind is those who want to kick it down. The former are the vast majority of Chinese people. We have already glimpsed the beautiful prospects beyond the threshold. Crossing this threshold will allow us to ascend a step in the history of human life. The people are approaching this threshold with this kind of ideal and feeling. Although each person in this group has their own difficulties in crossing this threshold, as long as the ranks are properly organized and move forward consistently, this threshold can be crossed smoothly. The extremely small number of right-wing elements are those who want to kick the threshold down. They are hostile and fearful of the beautiful things we see. They want to trample us, the people who want to cross the threshold, under their feet, to flatten this threshold, and to transform the world we are about to enter into the capitalist kingdom they seek. This is, of course, a futile delusion beyond their capabilities. Their capitalist foothold has already been taken away by us. Hanging in the air, they still want to break down a strong threshold. Isn't that almost as impossible as trying to lift themselves into the sky by pulling their own hair?

    We must build and fight at the same time. This requires reorganizing the socialist army. Everyone participating in this army must discard the burdens on their backs. Communists and the working class need to rectify their work style in order to better unite and lead the entire team; peasants and urban and rural independent laborers need to undergo socialist transformation to discard the burdens of petty proprietors and their class consciousness; the bourgeoisie and their intellectuals need to discard the burdens of exploitation and the consciousness of exploitation, and transform themselves into socialist laborers and socialist intellectuals. The nationwide rectification campaign is precisely to complete this great reorganization. The heavier the burden, the more difficulties one faces, and the more steadfast effort is needed. Construction cannot stop, fighting cannot stop, and the team must continue to reorganize while advancing. This is our glorious and arduous task, which requires perseverance and a high degree of awareness.

    Those who want to kick the threshold down are fighting us. When we say we must fight at the same time, we are referring precisely to this. They will inevitably meet one of the following ends: revolt, become prisoners, but still have to "undergo a complete transformation" to cross this threshold. "Revolt" means taking the initiative to bow their heads and confess their crimes, make a thorough confession, turn over a new leaf, undergo a complete transformation, and then join the socialist ranks, atoning for their crimes and crossing the threshold with us. We strive to have as many of these people as possible. "Become prisoners" refers to those who are more stubborn and must undergo a period of socialist education. These people cross the threshold under the supervision of the socialist ranks. We hope there will be fewer of these people. And there are those right-wing elements who stubbornly resist reform and violate criminal law. They are dragged into the threshold with ropes and chains. We hope there will be even fewer of these people. Those who dare to commit murder and cause significant damage will inevitably be executed before the threshold. We never want this to happen, but if someone insists on forcing us to this point, there is no other way. The various ways those who want to kick the threshold down cross it are not pleasant for them; but when they enter the threshold, experience its benefits, and fully realize the truth, they cannot help but say that this is just and extremely benevolent governance. They will always say thank you one day. But to realize this benevolent governance of ours, we still need to fight resolutely.

    Everyone is inevitably going to cross this threshold. To borrow the words of scholars, "this is a historical inevitability," but how should one cross it oneself? Everyone needs to think carefully about this.

　　两种过关人
    流冰
    历史已把社会主义这一关推到我们面前。所有的中国人，除了立志不过关的人以外，不管愿意不愿意，都是要过这一关的。怎样过这一关？每个人都必须想一想了。
    列在关前的有这么两种人：一种是真正想过关的；一种是想踹关的。前者是中国人中的绝大多数。我们已眺望到了关隘那边的美好远景，渡过这一关，就可使我们在人类生活历史上升高一步。人民便是带着这种理想和心情，来过这一关的。尽管这群人中，过这一关，还各有其困难，但只要整编好队伍，一直向前，这一关是可以顺利通过的。为数极少的那批右派分子是想踹关的。他们对我们所看到的那美好的东西，是仇视和畏惧的。他们想把我们这群要过关的人踩在脚下，去踏平这道关隘，把我们所要进入的那个世界变为他们所企求的资本主义王国。这当然是力不从心的妄想。他们那块资本主义踏脚板，已被我们抽掉，四脚悬空了还想踏破一道坚强的关隘，比想拔着头发上天也差不了多少吧？
    我们一面要建设，一面要战斗。这就需要整编一下社会主义大军。参加这支大军的人，各要丢掉身上的包袱。共产党人和工人阶级，需要整顿作风，以便更好地团结和统率这整个队伍；农民和城乡独立劳动者，需要经过社会主义改造丢掉小私有者及其阶级意识的包袱；资产阶级及其知识分子，需要丢掉剥削和剥削意识的包袱，并把自己改造为社会主义劳动者、社会主义知识分子。全国人民的大整风，正是为了完成这种大整编的。包袱愈大愈重的人，困难愈多，愈是需要坚强的努力。建设不能停止，战斗不能停止，队伍要一面行进一面整编。这是我们光荣而又紧张的任务，这需要坚忍不拔的精神和高度的自觉。
    想踹关的人正在同我们战斗。我们说的一面要战斗，指的正是这件事。他们免不了以下几种收场：起义，当俘虏，但也仍得“脱胎换骨”来过这道关。“起义”，即主动地低头认罪，彻底交代，洗心革面，脱胎换骨，然后参加社会主义队伍，将功赎罪，同我们一道过关，我们力图使这样的人尽量的多起来。“当俘虏”，即那些较为顽劣必须进行一个时期社会主义教养的人，这种人是在社会主义队伍的督押下过关了，我们希望这样的人会少些。还有那些顽抗改造，触犯刑律的右派分子，他们是身带绳锁，被我们拉进关去的。我们希望这样的人更少些。胆敢行凶杀人和造成重大损害的人，就免不了在关前被处极刑了。这种事我们是绝不愿有的，但如果有人硬要逼到这一步也没有别的法子。想踹关的人的几种过关，对他们来说，并不是一件愉快的事；但当他们进入关内，身受其福并且大彻大悟以后，便不能不说这是正义的而且是极大的仁政，他们总会有一天说声谢谢的。但要实现我们的这仁政，也还是要坚决的战斗才行。
    这道关人人总是免不了要过的，借用学者们的话“这是历史的必然性”，但是自己应当怎样过法呢？这就要每个人仔细想一想了。
