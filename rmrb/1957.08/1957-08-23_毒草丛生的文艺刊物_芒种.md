The literary monthly "Mang Zhong," published by the Shenyang Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles, has recently become the target of extensive exposure and criticism in the Liaoning Daily and Shenyang Daily as a breeding ground for poisonous weeds. This magazine, which touts itself as "incisive and bold, intervening in life," has published a series of works since its inception in January of this year that distort real life and vilify senior Party leaders. Especially the essays in the June and July issues, almost every one is steeped in poison. At the same time, this magazine has also published many gray works that cater to backward tastes. The most vicious articles, "Is it So? Or Not?" and "Who is a Sage?" actually came from the pen of Guo Xu, the editor of the magazine, and were published with the support of Wang Huanan, chairman of the Shenyang Federation of Literary and Art Circles. "Is it So? Or Not?" depicts a so-called decayed leader of a literary and art organization whose vitality is about to wither, yet he was promoted two grades during a salary evaluation. The author maliciously attempts to slander our society as being full of decay and depravity, devoid of any sense of right and wrong. The article "Who is a Sage?" fabricates a section chief whom subordinates tremble at the sight of and speak to in a low voice; even so, they still cannot avoid being subjected to various forms of torment. The author tries to create the impression that this leader is like a demon, and those he leads have no freedom of thought. Guo Xu admitted that his two poisonous arrows were mainly aimed at two leading cadres of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. He considered them to be "ignorant and incompetent," "ideologically declining," and "tyrants." And the Party protects these "bad people." Therefore, he wants to "intervene boldly." In the article "A Day in the Life of Minister Zhao," the author, Deng Qian, purposefully portrays a senior Party leader as a fatuous ruler who only knows how to sleep, scold people, and play with antiques.

Since the start of the anti-Rightist struggle, this magazine has remained silent, and even continued to spread poison in the July issue, failing to make a serious examination of its mistakes, which has aroused the indignation of the vast readership.

### 毒草丛生的文艺刊物“芒种”

　　毒草丛生的文艺刊物“芒种”
    沈阳市文联出版的一个毒草丛生的文艺月刊——“芒种”，最近已成为辽宁日报、沈阳日报大量揭露批判的对象。这个标榜着“辛辣大胆，干预生活”的刊物，从今年1月创刊以来，发表了一系列的歪曲现实生活，丑化党的高级领导干部的作品。特别六七两期上的杂文，几乎每篇都浸透了毒汁。同时，这个刊物还发表了不少灰色的、迎合落后趣味的作品。最恶毒的文章
  “是耶？非耶？”“谁是圣人？”居然是出自该刊主编郭墟之手，并在沈阳文联主席王化南赞助下发出的。“是耶？非耶？”是描写一个所谓腐朽了的、生命力即将枯竭的文艺机关的领导人，在评薪时竟然连升了两级。作者恶意地企图用此来诬蔑我们这个社会到处是腐朽堕落，没有是非可言。“谁是圣人？”一文是捏造有这样一位处长，下级见了这位人物就要浑身战栗，低声下气；即使这样，仍还免不了要受种种折磨。作者极力使读者形成这种印象：好像这个领导人是一个魔王，被他领导的人是没有任何思考自由的。郭墟承认，他的这两支毒箭主要是攻击中共沈阳市委的两位领导干部。他认为他们是“不学无术的”、“是思想衰退者”，是“暴君”。而党则维护这些“坏人”。因此他要“大胆干预”。在“赵部长的一日”文中，作者邓谦把一位党的高级领导干部别有用心地描绘成为只知昏睡、骂人、玩弄古物的昏君。
    反右派斗争开始后，这个刊物一直保持沉默，甚至在7月号仍然在继续放毒，对错误始终不作认真的检查，这引起广大读者的愤慨。
