    Modifying Regulations and Systems, Simplifying Confidentiality Procedures
    Ministry of Electric Power Establishes Various Special Groups to Study and Handle Mass Opinion
    (Our Newspaper News) The Ministry of Electric Power's plan for streamlining its organization has also been largely determined. In the establishment of departments and divisions, departments with closely related work will be merged according to the principle of strengthening collaboration; units that do not need to be established as departments will have their departments abolished. While streamlining the upper-level organization, some of the adjusted cadres have been sent down to the grassroots level. Up to now, more than 200 technical and management cadres have been sent down from the Ministry of Electric Power and the Hydroelectric General Bureau. The supply offices of the Ministry of Electric Power in Tianjin and Shenyang, and the supply stations of the Capital Construction General Bureau in Tianjin and Changchun, were also merged in July.
    The Ministry of Electric Power and its six directly subordinate units in Beijing have universally established various groups led by responsible comrades to be responsible for sorting out and studying the criticisms and suggestions put forward by the masses, and to propose handling opinions. The Ministry of Electric Power and the Hydroelectric General Bureau have made appropriate revisions to the four more important regulations and systems currently in use. In addition, in accordance with changes in the domestic situation, confidentiality procedures have been simplified, and restrictions on visits, internships, and borrowing materials have been relaxed.

    修改规程制度  简化保密手续
    电力部成立各种专门小组研究处理群众意见
    本报讯　电力部机关的精简机构方案，也已经大体确定。在司、处的设置上，将根据加强协作的原则，将工作关系相近的司合并；不必设司的单位，把司撤销。在精简上层机构的同时，一部分调整出来的干部已经下放到基层。到目前为止，电力部机关和水电总局两个单位，已经下放了技术干部和管理干部二百多人。电力工业部设在天津、沈阳的供应办事处，与基建总局设在天津、长春的供应站，也已经在7月份分别合并。
    电力工业部和所属北京的六个直属单位，普遍成立了由负责同志主持的各种小组，来负责整理、研究群众提出的批评和建议，并提出处理意见。电力部机关和水电总局，对现行的四种比较重要的规程、制度作了适当修改。还根据国内情况的变化，简化了保密手续，放宽了参观、实习和索借资料的限制。
