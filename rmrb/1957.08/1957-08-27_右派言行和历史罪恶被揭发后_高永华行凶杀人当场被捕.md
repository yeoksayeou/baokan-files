After Rightist Statements and Historical Crimes Were Exposed
　　Gao Yonghua Commits Murder and is Arrested on the Spot

(Our newspaper's dispatch from Kunming, August 26th) During the period of the Great Blooming and Great Contending, the extremely vicious rightist Gao Yonghua dared to brutally murder Zhao Hongyou, the deputy director of the joint state-private general merchandise store, and accountant Luo Yijia, both comrades from Qilu County; before the crime was completed, Gao was arrested on the spot.

Gao Yonghua is a member of the bourgeoisie in Qilu County, Yunnan. Since the blooming and contending, he has spread a large number of reactionary fallacies, saying "Governor Gong (referring to the rightist Gong Zizhi, the vice governor of Yunnan Province) has control of the military power. I agree with Governor Gong's statement that there is 'great bumper harvest on one side and starvation on the other.'" He fabricated rumors and incited the masses, saying, "Why don't you peasants have anything to eat? Call the government cadres to come and see why you are eating melon vegetables." These fallacies aroused the anger of the workers and peasants of Qilu County, and they gathered on August 18th to reason and struggle against him. During the reasoning and struggle, comrades Zhao Hongyou and Luo Yijia exposed Gao Yonghua's crimes of hiding gold and evading state taxes in his business operations, and exposed Gao Yonghua's conspiracy to deliberately mess up the accounts during his management of goods after the joint operation. They also exposed Gao Yonghua's hooligan behavior of raping women before liberation. Gao Yonghua not only refused to admit his mistakes, but on the night of August 20th, he wielded a kitchen knife and, while Luo Yijia was carrying salt, slashed Luo twice on the head; after that, Gao also slashed Deputy Director Zhao Hongyou seven times on the head, seriously injuring comrades Zhao and Luo. At this time, Wang Xiaolin, the deputy director of the nearby Qilu County Public Security Bureau, and Qiao Jingheng, the chief procurator, and other comrades arrived after hearing the commotion, fought with the murderer, and captured the criminal. The interrogation of Gao is currently underway.

　  右派言行和历史罪恶被揭发后
　　高永华行凶杀人当场被捕
    本报昆明26日电　在大鸣大放期间，穷凶极恶的右派分子高永华竟敢残杀我杞麓县公私合营土杂货门市部副主任赵鸿有和会计罗以家两同志；行凶未了，高犯当场被捕。
    高永华是云南杞麓县的资产阶级分子。鸣放以来，他大量散布反动谬论，说“龚省长（即右派分子云南省副省长龚自知）掌握兵权，我同意龚省长的现在是一面大丰收、一面饿死人的说法”，他造谣煽惑群众说：“你们农民为什么没有吃的呢？叫政府的干部来看看，你们为什么吃瓜菜。”他的这些谬论激起了杞麓县职工和农民的愤怒，并在8月18日集会同他说理斗争。在说理斗争中，赵鸿有、罗以家两同志揭发了高永华在经营商业中隐匿黄金逃避国家税收的罪行，揭发了高永华在合营后管理货物期间，故意把账目搞乱的阴谋。他们还揭发了高永华在解放前强奸妇女的流氓行为。高永华不但不承认错误，竟于8月20日夜手持菜刀趁罗以家抬盐的时候，向罗头上连砍两刀；之后高犯又向副主任赵鸿有头上连砍七刀，赵、罗两同志身负重伤。此时，邻近的杞麓县公安局副局长王效林、检察长乔景恒等同志闻声赶到，同凶犯搏斗，并将凶犯捕获。现正对高犯审讯中。
