    Foreign Trade of European People's Democratic Countries
    Jiang Jiuyuan
    With the development of socialist economic construction, the foreign trade of European people's democratic countries is expanding year by year, and the number of countries establishing trade relations with them is increasing. For example, Poland's trade volume has increased by 1.2 times compared with pre-war levels, Romania by 1.6 times, Czechoslovakia by 2.2 times, Hungary by 2.4 times, and Bulgaria by 3 times. In 1956, the foreign trade of the German Democratic Republic increased by 1.2 billion rubles compared with 1955. Compared with 1950, exports increased two and a half times and imports increased two times. These countries now trade with dozens of countries. Among them, the German Democratic Republic and Czechoslovakia have trade relations with almost all countries in the world.

    The foreign trade of European people's democratic countries not only increases in quantity year by year, but also, with the development of socialist construction, especially the achievements of industrialization, profound changes have taken place in their import and export structure. Before liberation, most of the Southeast European countries were backward agricultural countries, and most of their exported goods were agricultural products and industrial raw materials. Under the people's democratic system, their industries have developed rapidly. In 1956, the industrial output of these countries increased from more than one to ten times compared with pre-war levels. Now, most of them have changed from agricultural countries to industrial countries, and industrial products occupy a major position in their exports. Before the war, agricultural products, raw materials, and semi-finished products accounted for 94% of Poland's exports, and finished products accounted for only 6%. Among them, the proportion of machinery, industrial equipment, and transportation tools was less than 1% of the total exports. Last year, industrial products accounted for more than 72% of Poland's exports, of which machinery, equipment, and transportation tools had risen to about 15% of the total exports, and they also began to export complete sets of industrial enterprise equipment.

    In 1956, the export of machine manufacturing products in Czechoslovakia increased by five and a half times compared with pre-war levels, reaching 40% of the total exports. In terms of imports, raw materials ranked first, exceeding half of the total imports, and agricultural products and grains ranked second. Romania's machine manufacturing industry can now not only basically meet the domestic needs for machinery and equipment, but also export more and more machinery and industrial equipment. Last year, the total value of its exported machinery exceeded the total value of its imported machinery.

    Before liberation, agricultural products accounted for 70% of Hungary's total exports. By 1955, more than three-quarters of Hungary's exports were industrial products. Even in Albania, which was the most backward before liberation, during the first five-year plan ending in 1955, oil, asphalt, and other mineral products and processed timber accounted for 70% of its total exports. In addition, it also exported industrial finished products such as textiles and cement. In Bulgaria, where agricultural products accounted for more than 90% of exports before liberation, more than half of its exports are now industrial products.

    Foreign trade occupies a particularly important position in the economic cooperation among socialist camp countries. Socialist countries have abundant natural resources, strong industrial strength, and developed agriculture. Their industrial output already accounts for about 30% of the world's total industrial output. Therefore, the socialist world market actually possesses all the necessary conditions to enable the economy of each socialist country to develop normally. With the continuous strengthening of the international division of labor among socialist countries, their trade links are of greater significance. At present, trade with socialist camp countries accounts for at least 60% of the total value of foreign trade of European people's democratic countries. Trade in the socialist world market is conducted in a planned manner through long-term trade agreements. With the economic upswing of various socialist countries, their trade is also constantly expanding. This plays a significant role in the planned socialist construction of various people's democratic countries.

    In the socialist world market, the Soviet Union plays a particularly significant role. The Soviet Union accounts for about one-half and one-third of the total value of foreign trade in Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia respectively, 47.6% of the trade in Romania, and 27% in Poland. The machinery and equipment exported by the Soviet Union have accelerated the socialist industrialization of European people's democratic countries and strengthened their economic strength. In the five years starting from 1948, the Soviet Union supplied nine times more machinery and equipment to the people's democratic countries. The industrial raw materials supplied by the Soviet Union to Poland account for more than 50% of Poland's needs in this regard. According to the 1957 trade protocol, the Soviet Union will supply Poland with 4 million tons of iron ore, 70,000 tons of cotton, and a large amount of oil and non-ferrous metals. About 80% of Bulgaria's existing tractors and combine harvesters come from the Soviet Union. All the iron ore imported by Hungary this year will be supplied by the Soviet Union.

    In the socialist world market, each country can obtain the commodities it needs at fair and reasonable prices, and there are no phenomena inherent in the capitalist market such as price fluctuations, unequal exchange, and dumping of surplus products. For example, one ton of Bulgarian jam can be exchanged for 15,400 kilograms of gasoline in the Soviet Union, while it can only be exchanged for 9,100 kilograms of gasoline in the capitalist market; one ton of lead ore can be exchanged for 225 kilograms of stainless steel in the capitalist market, but it can be exchanged for 305 kilograms in the Soviet Union.

    Trade between the people's democratic countries is also of great significance to their economic development. In the past decade, Poland has imported machinery and industrial equipment worth about 2 billion rubles from Czechoslovakia and exported about 35 million tons of coal to it. In 1947, the trade volume between Poland and Czechoslovakia was only 84.3 million rubles, but in 1956 it had risen to 630 million rubles. In recent years, trade between China and these countries has also developed rapidly. For example, the trade volume between Czechoslovakia and China increased by about five times from 1950 to 1956.

    While comprehensively developing trade relations, socialist countries are also striving to develop economic relations with the capitalist world. Proceeding from the principle of peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems, they have always advocated vigorously developing trade with all countries in the world on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. Despite the discriminatory and embargo policies adopted by the imperialist group against socialist camp countries in trade, socialist countries have made great progress in trade with capitalist countries, especially with Asian and African countries, in recent years. Last year, capitalist countries accounted for more than one-third of the foreign trade volume of Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary. In 1956, Czechoslovakia's trade volume with capitalist countries increased by 33.2% compared with 1955, with the largest increase being in economically underdeveloped Asian and African countries. For example, its trade volume with Egypt increased by about one time. Recently, it signed a contract with Syria to help Syria build a giant oil refinery with an annual processing capacity of 1 million tons of oil. In 1955, Poland's trade volume with India was only about 10 million zlotys, but in 1956 it increased to nearly 60 million zlotys. Last year, Poland also signed trade agreements with Indonesia, Pakistan, Afghanistan and other countries for the first time. Last year, the trade volume between the German Democratic Republic and countries such as India, Egypt, and Syria increased by about one to two times compared with 1955. They not only supply economically underdeveloped Asian and African countries with various machines and transportation tools, but also export complete sets of equipment for textile, sugar-making, and cement factories to these countries, selflessly helping them establish various factories.

    The trade between European people's democratic countries and Asian and African countries is not like that of imperialist countries, which try to take advantage of Asian and African countries everywhere, but is conducted according to the principle of equality and mutual benefit, and takes into account the needs and possibilities of both parties, and sometimes gives them preferential conditions. For example, Romania sells oil to Egypt at prices lower than the world market. In the past, the export products of Asian and African countries could only find markets in capitalist countries, so they had to be manipulated and exploited by monopoly capital. Now, socialist countries have helped them solve the sales difficulties of major products. For example, Egyptian cotton, Burmese rice, and Indonesian and Ceylon rubber have found broad markets in socialist countries. Now, some economically underdeveloped countries in the Asian and African regions have the possibility of obtaining economic and technical assistance from the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries to develop their national industries.

    In 1957, the foreign trade of European people's democratic countries will be further developed. According to the plan, Bulgaria's foreign trade volume will increase by 22% compared with 1956, with exports increasing by about 26%. Czechoslovakia's foreign trade volume this year will increase by 11% compared with last year. According to the 1957 trade agreements or protocols, the trade between many people's democratic countries and the Soviet Union will greatly increase compared with last year. The trade between Bulgaria and the Soviet Union will expand by 50%, the trade between Albania and the Soviet Union will increase by 40%, the trade between the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union will increase by more than 35%, and the trade between Poland and the Soviet Union will increase by about 23%. Foreign trade occupies an important position in the socialist economic construction of European people's democratic countries. It guarantees the supply of machinery and equipment, various raw materials, and some consumer goods needed for the country's economic construction, and at the same time guarantees the sales of the country's industrial and agricultural products in the international market. Through foreign trade, European people's democratic countries make their own contributions to the economic cooperation among all countries in the socialist camp. Therefore, the growth of these countries' foreign trade not only contributes to the progress of socialist construction in European people's democratic countries, but also helps to strengthen the economic cooperation among socialist countries.

    欧洲人民民主国家的对外贸易
    姜久源
    随着社会主义经济建设的发展，欧洲各人民民主国家的对外贸易一年比一年扩大，同它们建立贸易关系的国家越来越多。例如，波兰的贸易额比战前增加了一点二倍，罗马尼亚增加了一点六倍，捷克斯洛伐克增加了二点二倍，匈牙利增加了二点四倍，保加利亚增加了三倍。1956年德意志民主共和国的对外贸易比1955年增加了十二亿卢布，如果和1950年相比，那末出口增加了两倍半，进口增加了两倍。这些国家现在都同几十个国家进行贸易。其中如德意志民主共和国和捷克斯洛伐克几乎同世界上所有的国家都有贸易关系。
    欧洲各人民民主国家的对外贸易不仅在数量上年年增加，而且随着社会主义建设事业的发展、特别是工业化的成就，它们进出口的结构也发生了深刻的变化。在解放以前，东南欧国家大多数是落后的农业国，它们输出的商品绝大部分是农产品和工业原料。在人民民主制度下，它们的工业得到了迅速的发展。1956年，这些国家的工业产量比战前分别增加了一倍多到十倍。现在，它们大都已经由农业国变成工业国，工业品在它们的出口当中占着主要地位。波兰战前的出口中，农产品、原料和半制品占94％，制成品只占6％，其中机器、工业设备和运输工具所占比重还不到出口总额的1％。去年，在波兰的出口中，工业品已经占72％以上，其中机器、设备和运输工具已经上升到出口总额的15％左右，而且还开始输出了成套的工业企业设备。
    1956年，捷克斯洛伐克的机器制造业产品的出口比战前增加了五倍半，达到出口总额的40％。在进口方面，原料占第一位，超过进口总额的一半，农产品和粮食占第二位。罗马尼亚机器制造业现在不仅基本上能够满足国内对机器和设备的需要，而且还能出口越来越多的机器和工业设备。去年它出口的机器的总值超过了它进口的机器的总值。
    解放前，农产品在匈牙利整个出口中占70％，到1955年，在匈牙利出口中已经有四分之三以上是工业品。就是在解放前最落后的阿尔巴尼亚，在1955年结束的第一个五年计划期间，在它的整个出口中，石油、沥青以及其他矿产品和加工木材就占70％，另外还输出了纺织品、水泥等工业制成品。解放前出口中有90％以上是农产品的保加利亚，现在它的出口中已经有一半以上是工业品了。
    对外贸易在社会主义阵营国家的经济合作中占有特别重要的地位。社会主义国家拥有丰富的天然资源、雄厚的工业实力和发达的农业，它们的工业产量已经占全世界工业总产量的30％左右。因此，社会主义世界市场实际上拥有一切必要条件来使每个社会主义国家的经济得到正常的发展。随着社会主义国家国际劳动分工的不断加强，它们之间的贸易联系也就具有更大的意义。目前，同社会主义阵营各国的贸易，在欧洲各人民民主国家的对外贸易总值中的比重至少在60％以上。社会主义世界市场的贸易是通过长期贸易协定有计划地进行的。随着各个社会主义国家经济的高涨，它们之间的贸易也在不断扩大。这对各人民民主国家有计划地进行社会主义建设具有重大的作用。
    在社会主义世界市场上，苏联起着特别巨大的作用。苏联在保加利亚和捷克斯洛伐克的对外贸易的总值中分别占到二分之一和三分之一左右，在罗马尼亚的贸易中占47.6％，在波兰占27％。苏联输出的机器和设备加速了欧洲人民民主国家的社会主义工业化，加强了它们的经济力量。从1948年起的五年当中，苏联供给各人民民主国家的机器和设备就增加了九倍。苏联供给波兰的工业原料占波兰在这方面需要量的50％以上。根据1957年贸易议定书，苏联将供给波兰四百万吨铁矿砂，七万吨棉花和大量的石油和有色金属。保加利亚现有的拖拉机和联合机中约有80％是从苏联来的。匈牙利今年进口的铁矿砂将全部由苏联供给。
    在社会主义世界市场上，各个国家可以用公平合理的价格得到它所需要的商品，完全没有资本主义市场所固有的物价波动、不等价交换和剩余产品倾销的现象。例如，一吨保加利亚果子酱在苏联可以换到一万五千四百公斤汽油，而在资本主义市场上只能换到九千一百公斤汽油；一吨铅矿砂在资本主义市场上可以换到二百二十五公斤不锈钢，在苏联，就可以换到三百零五公斤。
    各人民民主国家之间的贸易对它们的经济发展也具有重要意义。在过去十年中，波兰从捷克斯洛伐克输入了价值约二十亿卢布的机器和工业设备，向它输出了约三千五百万吨煤。1947年，波兰同捷克斯洛伐克的贸易额只有八千四百三十万卢布，1956年已经上升到六亿三千万卢布。最近几年来，中国和这些国家的贸易也有迅速的发展。例如，捷克斯洛伐克和中国的贸易额在1950年到1956年期间增加了约五倍。
    社会主义国家在全面发展贸易关系的同时，也在努力发展同资本主义世界的经济关系。它们从不同社会制度的国家和平共处的原则出发，一贯主张在平等互利的基础上大力发展同世界上一切国家的贸易。尽管帝国主义集团在贸易上对社会主义阵营各国采取歧视和禁运政策，社会主义国家近几年来同资本主义国家、特别是同亚非国家的贸易有了很大的开展。去年资本主义国家在波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和匈牙利的对外贸易额中占了三分之一以上。1956年捷克斯洛伐克同资本主义国家的贸易额比1955年增加了33.2％，其中增加得最多的是经济不发达的亚非国家。例如它同埃及的贸易额就增加了约一倍。最近，它又同叙利亚签订合同，帮助叙利亚建设一个每年加工一百万吨石油的巨型炼油厂。1955年，波兰同印度的贸易额只有一千万兹罗提左右，而1956年就增加到将近六千万兹罗提。去年波兰同印度尼西亚、巴基斯坦和阿富汗等国也第一次签订了贸易协定。德意志民主共和国去年同印度、埃及、叙利亚等国的贸易额比1955年增加了约一倍到两倍。它们不但供给经济不发达的亚非国家以各种机器和运输工具，而且还向这些国家输出纺织、制糖和水泥等工厂的成套设备，无私地出力帮助它们建立各种工厂。
    欧洲人民民主国家同亚非国家的贸易，不像帝国主义国家那样处处要占亚非国家的便宜，而是根据平等互利的原则，并且照顾到双方的需要和可能来进行的，有时还给它们以优惠的条件。例如，罗马尼亚就以低于世界市场的价格出售石油给埃及。过去，亚非国家的出口品只有在资本主义国家市场中寻找市场，因而它们不得不受垄断资本的操纵和剥削。现在，社会主义国家帮助它们解决了主要产品的销售困难，例如，埃及的棉花、缅甸的大米、印度尼西亚和锡兰的橡胶就在社会主义国家找到广阔的市场。现在，亚非地区的一些经济不发达的国家已经有可能从苏联和各人民民主国家方面得到经济和技术的援助来发展本国的民族工业了。
    1957年，欧洲各人民民主国家的对外贸易将有进一步的开展。根据计划，保加利亚的对外贸易额将比1956年增加22％，其中出口约增加26％。捷克斯洛伐克今年对外贸易额将比去年增加11％。根据1957年的贸易协定或议定书，许多人民民主国家同苏联的贸易将比去年大大增加，保苏贸易将扩大50％，阿苏贸易将增加40％，民主德国和苏联的贸易将增加35％以上，波苏贸易将增加23％左右。对外贸易在欧洲人民民主国家的社会主义经济建设中占有重要的地位。它保证本国经济建设所需要的机器设备、各项原料以及人民生活所需的一些消费品的供应，同时保证本国工农业产品在国际市场上的销售。通过对外贸易，欧洲人民民主国家对整个社会主义阵营各国的经济合作作出自己的贡献。因此，这些国家的对外贸易的增长，不仅有助于欧洲人民民主国家社会主义建设的进展，而且也有助于社会主义各国经济合作的加强。
