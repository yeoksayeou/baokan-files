    Soul Corroder
    Yuan Shuipai　Poem
    Hua Junwu　Drawing
    The anti-Party writer apologizes to the enemy and demonstrates against the people; feels sympathy for traitors, and sees comrades as thorns in their eyes; becomes intimately attached to secret agents and treats the organization as an enemy; as a Communist Party member, fears the civil servants at home; advocates "a scholar dies for his benefactor," regardless of whether he is an alien class element. Conspires with a group to oppose the Party, yet accuses the Party of factionalism. Claims that as long as they write works, they have the capital to oppose the Party; one book can reap fame, fortune, and "immortality," urging young writers to follow her. I urge you to wake up quickly and leave the anti-Party path!

　　The director with a feudal gang leader's signboard is a film director in name, but actually a feudal gang leader. Serves whoever provides benefits, and reaches out for money; has long abandoned the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. Actually shouts the slogan: "Strive for the RMB!" You've gone down the wrong path, turn back early; be a soul engineer, not a soul executioner.

　　The comprador politician journalist is a journalist and professor, a politician and a writer, who relies on the political science clique and flatters Song Ziwen; eats in China but saves money in London; is intimate with this woman and engaged to that woman; wears People's clothing but has his heart in the Atlantic; always plays both sides, boasting that he never fails. Regards the American consul as a "god" and scolds his compatriots as "inferior beings;" a comprador's soul and a lackey's behavior. Opium literature has been defined and attacks the Party and the people. To be reborn, one must reform and cleanse oneself.

    反党的作家向敌人赔罪，向人民示威；对叛徒抱同情，看同志像眼中钉；攀特务做至亲，把组织当仇人；身为共产党员，却害怕家里的公务员；提倡“士为知己者死，”哪管他是阶级异己分子。联络一帮人反党，却诬蔑党有宗派。扬言只要写出作品，便有反党资本；一本书可以猎取名利和“不朽”，叫青年作家都跟她走。劝你赶快醒悟，离开反党道路！
　　封建把头的导演招牌是电影导演，实际是封建把头。有奶便是娘，有钱就伸手；工农兵方向，早已抛脑后。居然喊口号：“为人民币奋斗！”走错了道，趁早回头，要做灵魂工程师，莫当灵魂刽子手。
　  洋奴政客的记者记者兼教授，政客兼文人，投靠政学系，巴结宋子文；吃饭在中国，存钱在伦敦；和这个女人相好，又和那个女人订婚；身穿人民装，心在大西洋；从来脚踏两只船，自夸门门不落空。认美国领事是“神仙”，骂自己同胞是“贱种”，洋奴的灵魂，西崽的行径。鸦片文学有定评，进攻党和人民。要想重新做人，必须洗面革心。
