　　He Fled

　　Sha Sha
　　
　　On the eve of that symposium, a rightist "fled." But the great debate continues, and the "flight" must also expose his true colors. It's just that on the debt he owes the people, another shameful mark has been added!

　　他逃跑了
    沙沙在那次座谈会的前夜，一个右派分子“逃跑”了。但是大辩论依旧进行，“逃跑”也要揭露他的原形。只是在他欠人民的债上，又添下了可耻的一笔！
