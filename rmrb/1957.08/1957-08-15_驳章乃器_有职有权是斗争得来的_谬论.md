Refuting Zhang Naiqi's Fallacy that "Having a Position and Power Comes from Struggle"
Zhou Boping, Director of the Policy Research Office of the Ministry of Food

Zhang Naiqi said that his "having a position and power came from struggle," which is completely fallacious. I have been working in the Ministry of Food since October 1953 and have worked with Zhang for a long time. I understand very well that the Party Leadership Group and Party member comrades in charge of the Ministry of Food have consistently respected Zhang Naiqi's authority as minister. Although there are often disputes in the work, these disputes all belong to the disputes of right and wrong in work, not the struggle for power. To enable comrades to understand the situation, I will give a brief introduction to the three major disputes between the Party Leadership Group and Party member comrades in charge and Zhang Naiqi over the years.

The first dispute occurred in March and April of 1953. At that time, some new problems appeared on the food front. Everyone suggested that Zhang Naiqi write an article and publish it in the People's Daily to guide the work. After the article was written, everyone felt that there were many problems and many arguments were contradictory, especially that the food situation, which was not suitable for public disclosure at the time, was written into it. During the discussion, everyone put forward amendments. Because he was stubborn and unwilling to make changes, the article was not published. Since this incident, I have deeply felt that he is an unreasonable, arrogant, and disrespectful person to the Party.

The second dispute occurred in March 1954, regarding the issue of standard rice. After the establishment of the Ministry of Food, there was a period when the promotion of standard rice was tried out in some areas. The trial effect was not good, and the masses had many opinions. This was because the processing technology conditions were not enough, and the quality could not be guaranteed. In February 1954, Vice Premier Chen Yun exchanged views on food issues with the responsible comrades of the Party in various provinces at a meeting of the Party Central Committee. The responsible comrades of various provinces believed that according to the actual situation at that time, it was impossible to spend a lot of effort on standard rice. Therefore, the meeting decided not to engage in standard rice for the time being. The Party Leadership Group and the Processing Bureau of the Ministry of Food supported this policy. I was the director of the Processing Bureau at the time. However, because my understanding of this issue was insufficient, I saw that some places already produced 93-95 jin of cooked rice from 100 jin of brown rice, and thought that returning to about 92 jin would be enough, so I proposed returning to about 92 jin. At that time, the Party Leadership Group was busy with the work of unified purchase and sales and did not discuss this issue in detail, and agreed with my opinion. Zhang also expressed his agreement. At the Third National Conference of Food Bureau Directors, I presented this opinion on behalf of the Processing Bureau. At that time, the attention of the meeting was focused on the issue of unified purchase and sales, and no specific discussion was made on this. Before the conclusion of the meeting, the two Vice Ministers Chen reported the concluding opinions to the Central Financial and Economic Commission. The responsible comrade of the Central Financial and Economic Commission instructed that returning to about 92 jin could not solve the problem, and that it should be reduced to about 88-90 jin. Vice Minister Chen Xiyun conveyed the instructions of the Central Financial and Economic Commission at the Ministry affairs meeting, and everyone unanimously agreed. Zhang did not explicitly express his attitude. However, when summarizing the next day, he still insisted that every 100 jin of rice should yield about 92 jin of rice. The contradiction arose from this point. After several arguments, it could not be resolved, and the meeting documents could not be issued. Later, Vice Director Ye Jizhuang of the Central Financial and Economic Commission personally came to the Ministry of Food to participate in the Ministry affairs meeting to discuss this issue. I made a self-criticism at the meeting, and Zhang also made a self-criticism. When Ye Lao made a conclusion, he affirmed that it was necessary to return to about 88-90 jin, and at the same time partially adopted Zhang's opinion, that is, under strict control and ensuring quality, a small amount of 92 rice was retained. This solved the problem. During the debate, Zhang repeatedly said: before the higher authorities make a decision, he will make suggestions; after the decision is made, he will resolutely implement it. But in fact, after the higher authorities made a decision, he not only did not resolutely implement it, but was full of complaints, slandering the Party for replacing science with administration, and that the Party could not lead science. This is not a general problem of lack of organization and discipline, nor is it a general problem of inconsistency between words and deeds, but opposition to the Party's policy!

The third dispute occurred in March and April of 1956, regarding the conclusion of the National Conference of Food Bureau Directors. Zhang Naiqi said in his self-criticism that this dispute was only caused by his blind optimism, all of which were lies. The thing is like this. When Vice Minister Chen Xiyun spoke at the Conference of Food Bureau Directors, he proposed that improving the management of food should revolve around stabilizing the food situation. This is consistent with the opinion of the Party Leadership Group and is also correct. Zhang Naiqi did not agree with this statement, thinking that it was "undue anxiety," "endless worries," and right-leaning conservatism. After the meeting, he launched several debates with us. Zhang's blind optimism was certainly one of the reasons for the dispute, but it was not the main reason. The main reason was that he thought he had seized Vice Minister Chen Xiyun's weakness and wanted to attack Vice Minister Chen. I remember that during the debate, Zhang rarely touched on the topic, always talking nonsense, scolding one while pointing at another, and even openly said that Vice Minister Chen Xiyun had hidden forces in the Ministry of Food. It was precisely because Zhang's intentions were sinister that the dispute could not be resolved for a long time, and the summary of the meeting was delayed for more than two months. In mid-May, Comrades Kuang Ming, Liang Zhuhang, and I spent only two hours with Zhang to revise the summary, and Zhang easily accepted our opinions, presumably because Zhang knew that the conspiracy could not be realized. In short, we have fully understood Zhang Naiqi's intentions in this dispute.

The above is the situation of the three major disputes in the past few years. It can be seen from these disputes:

First, the disputes between the Party Leadership Group and the Party member comrades in charge of the Ministry of Food and Zhang are entirely disputes over right and wrong in work. This kind of dispute is also common within the Party. This is completely a normal phenomenon. If it is not for ulterior motives, how can it be said to be a struggle for power? Even if it is a struggle for power, what has Zhang gained? Naturally, power cannot be separated from right and wrong, and it is not "whoever has a higher rank has the final say." Having a position and power can only be used to do right things, not wrong things. We resolutely support the use of power to do right things; we resolutely oppose the use of power to do wrong things.

Second, in the relationship of working with Zhang, the Party Leadership Group and Party member comrades in charge of the Ministry of Food have faithfully implemented the Party's united front policy and have truly been both sincere and serious. When Zhang's mistakes are discovered, they always give specific guidance, patiently persuade him, and sincerely help him to correct them. If he insists on making mistakes, he will resolutely struggle against him and not let him play with his ministerial authority to harm the socialist cause. Taking this anti-Rightist struggle as an example, Zhang Naiqi released a lot of poisonous arrows, but when he showed repentance, we still helped him; naturally, if he stubbornly resists to the end, we also know how to strike him!

Third, Zhang Naiqi's character is bad, his methods are despicable, and his intentions are sinister. Zhang has a position and power in the Ministry of Food, which is entirely given by the Party and the state. The Party Leadership Group and Party member comrades in charge of the Ministry of Food have always respected his authority, and at the same time, they have constantly corrected his mistakes. But he fabricated rumors, saying that his position and power in the Ministry of Food were obtained through struggle. Such an utter lie, actually said with great seriousness, the thickness of his skin is really amazing! If he were not a politician with a bad character, how could he be so "experienced" and so shameless! How could he use such despicable means. Zhang Naiqi's purpose in fabricating rumors and lying on the issue of having a position and power, like his conspiracies in other aspects, is to instigate right-wing elements and all those with anti-Party sentiments to rise up against the Party's leadership! His intentions are extremely sinister. In our two conversations with him, he even beautified himself, as if he was not only not a right-wing element, but also a person who has always been loyal to the Party and the socialist cause. We pointed out the absurdity of his attitude, and he said: "Please forgive me, the hat of anti-Party and anti-socialism is too heavy." It turned out that he was afraid of wearing the hat of a right-winger, so he tried his best to deny his crimes. We solemnly warn Zhang Naiqi, your right-wing hat is fixed, now is the time for you to lay down your butcher knife and honestly confess your guilt!

### 驳章乃器“有职有权是斗争得来的”谬论

    驳章乃器“有职有权是斗争得来的”谬论
    粮食部政策研究室主任　周伯萍
    章乃器说他“有职有权是斗争得来的”，这完全是谬论。我1953年10月到粮食部工作，和章共事时间很久。我十分了解，粮食部党组和党员负责同志是一贯尊重章乃器的部长职权的。在工作中虽也常有争论，但是，这些争论，都属于工作上的是非之争，而不是权力之争。为使同志们了解情况，我把几年来党组和党员负责同志同章乃器进行的三次大争论的情形，作一个概略的介绍。
    第一次争论，是在1953年3、4月间，当时粮食战线上出现了一些新的问题，大家推章乃器写篇文章，在人民日报上发表，用来指导工作。文章写成后，大家感到问题很多，许多论点前后矛盾，特别是把当时不宜公开的粮食情况都写进去了，在讨论的时候，大家提出了修改意见，由于他固执己见，不肯修改，文章也未发表。自从这次事情以后，我就深深感到他是一个不讲道理的、狂妄的、不尊重党的人。
    第二次争论，是在1954年3月，关于标准米问题之争。粮食部成立后，有一个时期，曾在部分地区试行推广标准米，试行效果不好，群众意见很多。那是因为加工技术条件不够，质量保证不了。1954年2月间，陈云副总理在党中央开会时，同各省党的负责同志就粮食问题交换了意见，各省负责同志认为：根据当时的实际情况，不可能花很大力量搞标准米。因此，会议决定暂时不搞标准米。对这个方针，粮食部党组和加工局都是拥护的。我当时是加工局长。但由于我对这个问题认识不足，看到有些地方一百斤糙米已经出熟米九十三——九十五斤，以为退到九十二斤左右就可以了，所以提出了退到九十二斤左右的意见。当时党组忙于统购统销工作，对这个问题未作详细讨论，同意了我的意见。章也表示同意。在第三次全国粮食厅局长会议上，我代表加工局提出了这个意见。当时会议注意力集中在统购统销问题上，对此也未作具体讨论。会议总结前，两位陈副部长去中财委汇报总结意见，中财委负责同志指示，退到九十二斤左右不能解决问题，要退到八十八—九十斤左右。陈希云副部长在部务会议上传达了中财委指示，大家一致同意，章未明确表示态度。但在次日总结时，仍坚持每百斤稻谷要出米九十二斤左右。矛盾从这时发生了。经过多次争论，不能解决，会议文件因而不能发出。后来中财委叶季壮副主任亲来粮食部参加部务会议，讨论这一问题。我在会上作了检讨，章也作了检讨。叶老在作结论时，肯定必须退到八十八—九十斤左右，同时也部分地采纳了章的意见，即在严格控制、保证质量的条件下，保留小量九二米。这才解决了问题。章在争论过程中，一再说：上级未作决定前，他提意见；作了决定后，他坚决执行。但实际上上级作了决定以后，他不但不坚决执行，反而牢骚满腹，诬蔑党以行政代替科学，党不能领导科学等。这不是一般的无组织无纪律的问题，也不是一般的言行不一致的问题，而是反对党的方针！
    第三次争论，是在1956年3、4月间，关于全国粮食厅局长会议总结之争。章乃器在他的检讨中说这次争论只是由于他盲目乐观引起的，都是谎话。事情是这样的。陈希云副部长在厅局长会议发言时，曾经提出，改善粮食的经营管理工作，应当围绕稳定粮食局势的中心。这同党组的意见是一致的，也是正确的。章乃器不同意这种提法，认为这是“杞人忧天”，是“无穷的忧虑”，是右倾保守。会议结束后，他同我们展开了多次争论。章的盲目乐观情绪固然是争论的原因之一，但不是主要原因。主要原因是他自以为抓住了陈希云副部长的小辫子，想打击陈副部长。记得在争论过程中，章很少涉及本题，总是信口雌黄，指桑骂槐，甚至公然说陈希云副部长在粮食部有潜势力。正是因为章用心阴险，所以久争不决，会议总结拖了两个多月发不下去。5月中旬，邝明同志、梁竹航同志和我同章在一起只用两小时就把总结改好了，章轻易地接受了我们的意见，想来是由于章自知阴谋不能实现的原故。总之，章乃器在这次争论中的用心，我们是洞悉其奸的。
    以上就是几年来三次大争论的情况。从这些争论中可以看出：
    一、粮食部党组和党员负责同志同章的争论，完全是工作上的是非之争，这种争论，在党内也是常有的。这完全是一种正常的现象。如果不是别有用心，怎么可以说是权力之争呢？就算是权力之争吧，章又争得了什么呢？自然，权力不能离开是非，不是“谁官大谁说了算”。有职有权，只能行是，不能行非。用权行是，我们坚决支持；弄权行非，我们坚决反对。
    二、粮食部党组和党员负责同志在同章的共事关系上，是忠诚执行了党的统战政策的，真正做到了既诚恳又严肃。发现章的错误，总是具体指点，耐心说服，诚恳地帮助他改。如果他坚持错误，就坚决斗争，不让他玩弄部长职权，损害社会主义事业。就拿这次反右派斗争来说，章乃器放了很多毒箭，但当他有悔罪表示的时候，我们还是给他帮助的；自然，如果他顽抗到底，我们也知道应当怎样给以打击！
    三、章乃器的品质是恶劣的，手段是卑鄙的，用心是阴险的。章在粮食部有职有权，完全是党和国家给的。粮食部党组和党员负责同志一向尊重他的职权，同时也不断纠正他的错误。但他却造谣说，他在粮食部有职有权是斗争得来的。十足的谎言，居然说得煞有介事，脸皮之厚，实在惊人！不是品质恶劣的政客，哪有这样“老练”，这样厚颜无耻！又怎能用出这种卑鄙的手段。章乃器在有职有权问题上造谣说谎的目的，同他在其它方面的阴谋活动一样，为的是煽动右派分子和一切有反党情绪的人起来反对党的领导！他的用心是极其阴险的。在我们两次和他谈话时，他竟美化自己，好像他不但不是右派分子，而且还是一贯忠于党和社会主义事业的人。我们指出他这种态度的荒谬，他说：“请你们原谅，反党反社会主义的帽子太重了”。原来他是怕戴右派帽子，所以极力抵赖罪行。正告章乃器，你的右派帽子是戴定了，现在是你放下屠刀，老实认罪的时候！
