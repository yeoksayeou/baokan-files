Poetry Leaflet

　　"Self-Criticism"
　　Cao Yu is like a hat shop's invoice, and also like a dictionary of adjectives. From a distance, it looks like page after page of black characters, but up close it's just a blank sheet of paper!

　　Means
　　Zhu Ping's voice is hoarse, tears are constantly shed, her chin is close to her chest, and her eyebrows are drooping to the corners of her eyes, but in her heart she is calculating busily: "As long as your hearts soften, I will slip away through the cracks!"
