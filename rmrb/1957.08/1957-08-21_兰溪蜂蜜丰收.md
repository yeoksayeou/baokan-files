    Lanxi Honey Bumper Harvest

    (Our report) In July, during the height of summer, Lanxi, Zhejiang, had a bumper harvest of honey, with a yield of more than 100,000 jin, an increase of 80% compared with last year.

    This year's honey production benefited from the flourishing spring flower crops, such as rapeseed flowers and various flowering plants, which provided abundant nectar for the bees. At the same time, farmers in various regions vigorously developed beekeeping as a sideline production and actively engaged in hive splitting and propagation, resulting in the bumper harvest.

    兰溪蜂蜜丰收
    本报讯　7月盛夏，浙江兰溪蜂蜜获得大丰收；产量达十万余斤，比去年增产八成。
    今年的蜂蜜，由于春花作物如油菜花及各种花木生长茂盛，蜜蜂采蜜多而丰富，同时各地农民大力开展养蜂副业生产，积极分箱繁殖，所以能够获得丰收。（诸葛子房）
