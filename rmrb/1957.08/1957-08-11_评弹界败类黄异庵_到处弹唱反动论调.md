Huang Yian is an executive committee member of the Suzhou-Shanghai Pingtan Improvement Association. From the very beginning of the blooming and contending, he used the pretext of "strengthening" the Pingtan Association's organization to plot the downfall of the national Pingtan troupes in Shanghai, Suzhou, and Changshu. In early June, Huang Yian went to Shanghai and attempted to incite the masses to strike, march, and post leaflets.

Artists revealed that Huang Yian had extremely close relations with the rightist element Jiang Weikuan, the deputy director of the Suzhou Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League. Jiang Weikuan even introduced Huang Yian to Fei Xiaotong, an important figure in the Zhang-Luo Alliance who came from Suzhou. Huang Yian still refuses to confess his crimes. Pingtan artists in Shanghai and Suzhou have decided to continue to expose his reactionary words and deeds.

    到处弹唱反动论调
    本报讯　黄异庵是苏沪评弹改进协会的执行委员。鸣放一开始，他便假借“加强”评弹协会组织名义，阴谋搞垮上海、苏州和常熟三地的国家评弹团。6月初黄异庵到上海还企图煽动群众罢唱、游行、张贴传单。
    艺人们揭露，黄异庵和右派分子、民盟苏州市委副主任委员江维宽有极密切关系。江维宽还介绍黄异庵去会见到苏州来的章罗联盟重要人物费孝通。黄异庵到目前仍拒不认罪。上海、苏州两地评弹艺人决定继续揭露他的反动言行。
