　　One Month of Mountain Exploration
　　A Diary of Life on West Taibai Mountain by the Chinese Academy of Sciences Qinling Biogeography Expedition Team

    In July, West Taibai Mountain is draped in green finery. The snow at the top of the high mountains has melted, making this main peak of the Qinling Mountains even more majestic and beautiful. A lightly equipped mountaineering team of twenty people: they set off from the foot of the mountain in Mei County with iron hammers, walking sticks, canteens, dry food, compasses, and cameras. They are a Qinling Biogeography Expedition Team mainly composed of university teachers.

　  A First Greeting Gift
    Starting from Xieyu Pass and entering the West Taibai Mountain area, a clear river mixed with many white pebbles lies against the mountain. In this ancient battlefield area where Shu general Zhao Yun, Zhang Fei, and Ma Chao fought fiercely with the Wei soldiers during the Three Kingdoms period, they discovered lush cypress trees growing all over the mountains and valleys, with thick branches and verdant leaves. In the shallow mountain area below 1,000 meters above sea level, it is estimated that there are hundreds of thousands of square meters of this economically valuable tree. The expedition team saw a very complete cypress forest in the Longbanpo Wolong Temple mountain area, with large trees, small trees, and seedlings of varying heights growing in the high or low parts of the mountain area. Everyone said happily, this is Taibai Mountain Grandpa giving us our first greeting gift! Wen Honghan, professor of Northwest Agricultural College and botanist, told me that the discovery of this natural situation solved an important key to studying the process of forest community succession in the Taibai Mountain area. The investigation proves that the shallow mountain area here has the most and widest distribution of cypress forests, which is completely consistent with the situation of the East Taibai investigation last year. For a long time, scientists have been puzzled by the vegetation belt in this area and have not been able to give it a unified and accurate name. Some call it the cultivated land belt, and others name it the plain belt. He believes that it can now be accurately named the "cypress belt."

    The People Who Collect Flowers and Strike Stones
    During this stage of the expedition members' activities in the shallow mountains, nearby villagers often liked to come and watch, calling them flower collectors and stone strikers. These scientific workers worked hard all day long. At sunrise, they left the camp in groups, some climbing mountains and some entering gullies. Even when it rained, they still went to work as usual. The specimens brought back by the members of the botany group in the evening were always a thick stack weighing more than ten kilograms. Everyone has a notebook, and each day they add dozens or even hundreds of new plant names. The oldest member of the team is Professor Niu Chunshan, a forester, who is fifty-three years old this year, and his steps are still very steady when climbing steep cliffs. In the past month, he and several companions have collected hundreds of valuable tree specimens. It turns out that this year he accepted the commission from the National Science Planning Commission and the Ministry of Forestry to spend three years writing a "Dendrology" that summarizes the thousands of different types of trees in the Northwest provinces.

    The geography group has three young teachers. One day, they climbed up the Maocaodi mountain at an altitude of 1,700 meters to investigate and found that the rocks covered by the grass were originally white jade-like marble, some with patterns. Upon closer inspection, almost all of the five nearby mountain tops were this beautiful marble. This unexpected gain made them almost jump for joy. According to their preliminary judgment, the Taibai Mountain marble can be compared with the famous Yunnan marble and Northeast green marble and is a very good high-grade building material.
        In the Great Forest

    A poet once described the great Siberia like this: "Wilderness after wilderness, forest after forest, vast Siberia, where is your end." Entering the high mountain forest area of Taibai at an altitude of 2,000 to 3,000 meters, you have the same feeling. It is truly a hundred miles of trees in the vast sea of clouds. Here are cork oak forests with wide uses, paper birch forests with beautiful reddish-brown color, fir forests with majestic shapes and layered pagoda shapes, willows, pines and cypresses, too numerous to mention.

    The members of the forest expedition walked into the dense forest where the sun could not be seen. The busiest in the forest were several experienced professors, who kept running around, reporting the names of various trees, flowers, and plants they saw, as well as their ecology and morphology; some lecturers and teaching assistants helped to record, clamp specimens, measure the diameter of tree trunks at breast height, and excavate soil profiles. In order to find a typical paper birch community, they traveled over mountains and into gullies for almost a whole day, until dusk, when they saw many red paper birch branches faintly visible on a cliff opposite. At this time, everyone felt like they had found a treasure, but because it was already late, they decided to get up early the next morning to complete the sample plot survey of this birch forest.
      Evening Party on the High Mountain

    On August 8, the expedition team camped at the top of Dingpeng Mountain at an altitude of more than 3,000 meters, not far from the summit of West Taibai Mountain. The mountain here is suddenly open and clear. On the flat grassland, under the towering spire-shaped larches, the expedition team set up two white tents, like two petrels in the blue sea. Wisps of smoke rose into the blue sky. Wisps of white clouds floated over the towering mountain peaks, a scene that was refreshing. You said it was better than Zhongshan Park in Beijing, and he called it a high mountain sanatorium. The whole team held a rare dinner here. Everyone drank Xifeng famous wine and toasted to celebrate the soon-to-be-victorious arrival at the top of Taibai. After dinner, the campfire party began, with solo flute performances by the old professors, some singing Peking opera, and folk songs, crosstalk, and jokes by the young teachers, one exciting program after another. As night fell, the bright moon hung in the sky, and people lit a roaring campfire.

    Marching Towards the Summit of Taibai
    On the 11th, the weather was fine and sunny. The moment to march towards the summit of West Taibai Mountain had arrived. With excitement, they set off from Shuiwozi, five kilometers away from the summit, walking almost all the way on piles of large patches of rocks. At noon that day, the first batch of vanguard team members finally arrived victoriously at the summit—Zushi Platform (more than 1,000 meters higher than Huashan, one of the famous Five Mountains). Here, all that could be seen were bare, strangely shaped rocks with patches of green lichen, without a blade of grass. Only one kind of "Sedum" (alpine herb) with very small chrysanthemum red flowers could be seen in the cracks of the rocks.

    The expedition members who climbed to the summit of Taibai Mountain waved their iron hammers and walking sticks, waving to the soaring eagles and shouting loudly to the myriad deep mountains in the clouds. Oh, the majestic Taibai Peak! The famous poet Li Bai of the Tang Dynasty once wrote for you the magnificent lines: "Climbing up West Taibai Peak, I exhaust my climb in the setting sun; rising straight into the floating clouds, I can reach the moon by raising my hand." Today, these scientific workers of the new China have once again sung louder and more fascinating songs for you.

　　登山考察一月
　　科学院秦岭生物地理考察队在西太白山生活散记
　　新华社记者　孙传镐
    7月，西太白山披上绿色盛装。高山顶部白雪已经融化，使这座秦岭主峰愈发雄伟而俊秀。一行二十人的登山轻装队伍：他们拿着铁锤、手杖、背着水壶、干粮、罗盘、照相机，从郿县山脚下出发。他们是一支主要由大学教师组成的秦岭生物地理考察队。
　  第一次见面礼
    从斜峪关开始进入西太白山区，傍山卧躺着一条清彻见底的夹杂许多白卵石的河。就在这三国时代蜀将赵云、张飞、马超和魏兵大战厮杀的古战场一带，他们发现满山遍谷长着茂盛的侧柏树，枝干粗壮，叶色翠绿。在拔海一千公尺以下的浅山地区，这种经济价值很高的树估计约有好几十万平方公尺。考察队在长板坡卧龙寺山地，看到有一片非常完整的侧柏林，山地的高处或低部，都长着高矮不一的这种大树、小树和幼苗。大家高兴地说，这是太白山爷爷给我们的第一次见面礼！西北农学院教授、植物学家闻洪汉告诉我，这个自然情况的发现，解决了研究太白山区森林群落演替过程的一个重要关键。调查证明这里浅山地带以侧柏林分布最多最广，和去年东太白考察的情况也完全吻合。长久以来，科学家们对这一带植物带感到困惑，没有统一确切的定名，有人称垦殖带，也有人定名平野带，他认为现在可以确当定名为“侧柏带”。
    采花打石的人们
    考察队员在浅山活动这一阶段，附近乡民常常喜欢围来观看，称呼他们为采花的打石头的。这些科学工作者一天到晚都在紧张地工作着。旭日初升，他们就分组离开宿营地，登山的登山，进沟的进沟，逢到雨天，他们也照样出勤。植物组的队员傍晚背回来的标本采集夹总是十几斤重厚厚一大叠。每个人都有一本纪录本，一天总要新添上好几十种甚至上百种植物名称。队里年纪最长的是森林学家、牛春山教授，他今年已五十三岁，攀登陡削巉崖，步子仍然很稳健。一个月来，他和几个同伴共采集了好几百号名贵的树木标本。原来，他今年接受了国家科学规划委员会和林业部委托，准备前后花三年时间编写一本概括西北各省千异万类的“树木志”呢。
    地理组有三个年轻教师。有一天，他们爬上拔海一千七百公尺的茅草地山头考察，发现在草丛复盖下的岩石原来是洁白如玉的大理石，有的还有花纹。再仔细调查，附近五个山头，差不多全是这种漂亮的大理石。这一意外的收获，使他们高兴得几乎跳跃起来。据他们初步判断，太白山这种大理石可以和著名云南大理石和东北绿媲美，是一种很好的高级建筑材料。
        在大森林里
    有个诗人曾经这样描写伟大的西伯利亚：“旷野连着旷野，森林连着森林，茫茫的西伯利亚，那里是你的止境。”闯进拔海二、三千公尺的太白高山林区，也有同样的感受，真是苍茫云海间，林木千百里。这里有用途宽广的栓皮栎林，有棕红色漂亮的纸皮桦林，有姿态雄伟，层层宝塔形的冷杉林，杨柳松柏，不胜枚举。
    考察森林的队员们走进了浓密不见阳光的林子。在林子里最忙碌的是几个见识丰富的教授，他们不停地跑来跑去，报着所见各种林木、花草的名字以及它们的生态、形态；同行的一些讲师和助教，帮助做纪录，夹标本，丈量树干胸径的粗细，挖掘土壤剖面。他们为了找一个典型的纸皮桦群落，翻山进沟，跑了几乎整整一天，直到傍晚，才瞅见对边一块悬崖上隐隐许多红色纸皮桦枝干。这时大家如获珍宝，但因天已不早，就决定第二天清早起去突击完成这块桦木林的样地调查。
      高山上的晚会
    8月8日，这支考察队在拔海三千多公尺的顶篷山顶扎营，西太白山顶峰已不远了。这里山势豁然开朗。在平缓的草地上，在矗立的尖塔形的落叶松下，考察队搭起了两座白色帐篷，宛如碧海中的两只海燕。一缕缕炊烟升上了蓝天。卷卷白云飘忽在重重的山峰顶上，这景色令人心旷神怡。你说这里比北京中山公园还好，他又叫这里是高山疗养院。全队在这里举行了难得的聚餐，大家饮着西凤名酒，为快要胜利到达太白顶峰干杯。饭后，营火晚会开始了，老教授们的短笛独奏，有的清唱京戏，年轻教师的民歌、相声、笑话，精采的节目一个接着一个。夜幕来临，明月当空，人们燃起了熊熊的营火。
    向太白顶峰进军
    11日，风和日丽。向西太白山顶峰进军的时刻来到了。他们怀着激动、兴奋的心情，从离顶峰八里地的水窝子出发，一路几乎都是走在一大片一大片的乱石块堆上面。当天中午，第一批先锋队员终于胜利到达顶峰——祖师台（高出著名五岳之一华山达一千多公尺）。这里全是光秃秃附着斑斑绿色地衣的嶙峋怪石，寸草不生，石缝中只见到一种开着很小菊红花的“景天”（高山草本植物）。
    登上太白顶峰的考察队员们，挥舞着铁锤、手杖，向凌空飞翔的苍鹰挥手，向云雾间的万重深山大声欢呼。奇峻的太白峰啊！唐代著名诗人李白曾为你写出了“西上太白峰，夕阳穷登攀；直出浮云间，举手可近月”的壮丽诗句，今天，这些新中国的科学工作者又一次为你唱出了更响亮更迷人的歌声。
