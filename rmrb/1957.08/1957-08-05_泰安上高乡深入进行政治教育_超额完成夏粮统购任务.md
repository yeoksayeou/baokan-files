    Shanggao Township, Tai'an, Conducts In-Depth Political Education; Overfulfills Summer Grain Procurement Task

    (Our dispatch) Tai'an County, Shandong Province, Shanggao Township has overfulfilled its summer grain procurement task. The township's procurement task was 770,000 jin. It was originally thought that it would be difficult to procure even 560,000 jin, but now it has reached 830,000 jin.

    Shanggao Township's ability to achieve these results is due to the in-depth socialist education conducted, the struggle against capitalist ideologies in rural areas, the exposure of the destructive words and actions of landlords and rich peasants, and the overcoming of confused thinking among cadres and the masses.

    Before the socialist education was carried out, the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads in the countryside was clearly manifested in grain work. Last year, the basic food ration per person in the Taishan Cooperative reached 420 jin for the wheat and autumn harvests, plus extra grain for extra work. These rations were originally sufficient, but this spring 173 households were still clamoring for grain shortages. By summer, some of these so-called grain-deficient households were selling surplus grain on the free grain market. Grain merchants and speculators also took the opportunity to make trouble. Some cooperative cadres sympathized with certain members' erroneous practices of only considering personal interests and disregarding national interests. In terms of lifestyle, there was a lack of a thrifty and hardworking spirit. Many farmers had excessively high demands for food, clothing, and housing. In the Taishan Cooperative, 78 households went from having surplus money to lacking money because of blind consumption. Some members wanted to withdraw from the cooperative and work independently, while others were busy with sideline production during the busy farming season. At this time, a few landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries also took the opportunity to stir up trouble, spread destructive rumors, and incite members to be lazy, steal grain, and withdraw from the cooperative. Some grassroots and district/township cadres had a low level of class consciousness and harbored individualism and departmentalism, even regarding the destructive words and actions of lawless landlords and rich peasants as contradictions among the people, and they were afraid to criticize capitalist ideologies.

    In response to the above situation, the township launched a socialist propaganda and education movement starting in early July. First, a mobilization meeting was held for party members, Youth League branch secretaries, and production team leaders. Combining the criticism of the reactionary fallacies of bourgeois rightists attacking cooperation and attacking unified purchase and sale, it refuted the destructive words and actions of local landlords, rich peasants, and other bad elements, and the capitalist ideas of farmers, clarified right and wrong for key members, and drew clear lines. Then, a meeting of party and Youth League activists from the entire township was convened, and a large-scale discussion was organized. Examples of calculating accounts and comparing past and present were used to refute reactionary remarks. Then, the ideological education work was gradually expanded and deepened at each cooperative and team, using the same method of recalling and comparing past and present to comprehensively unfold ideological education work.

    Through repeated discussions, the class consciousness of cadres and the masses has been greatly improved. Cadres and the masses believe that "they have not received such a profound education since the high tide of cooperation last year." Some cadres took the initiative to examine their mistakes in being insufficiently vigilant and echoing the cries of grain shortages. Some members exposed the fact that landlords incited them to make trouble. The internal unity of agricultural cooperatives has become closer, and the enthusiasm of members for production has increased, and the attendance rate has increased. Agricultural cooperatives throughout the township have put forward the slogan of "selling more grain to support the country," and have also formulated specific plans for eliminating weeds, timely topdressing, and fully utilizing idle land to plant late autumn crops.

### 泰安上高乡深入进行政治教育  超额完成夏粮统购任务

    泰安上高乡深入进行政治教育
    超额完成夏粮统购任务
    本报讯　山东省泰安县上高乡夏粮统购任务已超额完成。全乡统购任务为七十七万斤，原先认为要统购五十六万斤都很难，现在已经达到了八十三万斤。
    上高乡能取得这些成绩，是由于进行了深入的社会主义教育，同农村中的资本主义思想进行了斗争，揭破了地主、富农分子的破坏言行，同时克服了干部和农民群众中的混乱思想。
    进行社会主义教育之前，农村中社会主义与资本主义两条道路的斗争，在粮食工作中明显地表露出来。泰山社去年麦秋的基本口粮每口人达四百二十斤，另外还有多劳多得粮。这些口粮本来是足够的，可是今年春季仍有一百七十三户叫嚷粮紧。到夏季，有的所谓缺粮户却又向粮食自由市场卖余粮。粮商粮贩也乘机捣乱。个别社干部也同情某些社员只顾个人利益、不顾国家利益的错误作法。在生活方面，缺乏勤俭持家的风气。相当多的农民对吃、穿、住的要求过高。泰山社有七十八户就是因为盲目消费，由余钱户变为缺钱户。有的社员曾想退社单干，有的在农忙时却忙着去搞副业生产。这时，少数地主、富农分子和反革命分子也趁机兴风作浪、散布破坏言论，煽动社员怠工、偷粮、退社。有些基层和区乡干部的阶级觉悟不高，存在着个人主义和本位主义的思想，竟至把不法地主、富农的破坏言行看作人民内部矛盾，对资本主义思想也不敢批判。
    针对上述情况，从7月上旬开始，全乡开展了社会主义宣传教育运动。先召开了党员、团支干、生产队长参加的动员会议，结合批驳资产阶级右派分子攻击合作化、攻击统购统销的反动谬论，反击本乡地主富农分子及其他坏分子的破坏言行和农民中的资本主义思想，使骨干分子明确了是非，划清了界限。接着又召开了全乡的党、团员积极分子会议，组织了大会讨论。用算几笔账和回忆对比的事例来反驳反动言论。然后再在各个社、队逐步扩大和层层深入，以同样的回忆对比为主的方法，全面展开思想教育工作。
    经过反复讨论，大大提高了干部和群众的阶级觉悟。干部和群众都认为：“从去年合作化高潮以来，没有受到过这样深刻的教育”。有的干部主动检讨了自己警惕性不高，跟着喊粮缺的错误言行。有的社员揭发了地主煽动他闹事的事实。农业社内部的团结更加密切了，社员生产积极性高涨，出勤率提高。全乡农业社提出了“多卖粮食支援国家”的口号，还订出了消灭草荒、及时追肥、充分利用空闲地种晚秋作物的具体计划。
