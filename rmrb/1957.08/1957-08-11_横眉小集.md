    What We Like and What We Hate
    Wang Chong
    The rightist Ma Zhemin, during the rectification campaign, instigated his cronies: "Like what the Party hates, hate what the Party likes." This sentence incisively summarizes the words and deeds of all bourgeois rightists.

    What we like and what we hate indeed represent our respective class standpoints. Imperialism is our mortal enemy, but the rightist Meng Zhaoying can't wait for an American to be president; socialism is what the people aspire to, but the rightists want to steer the great ship of New China into the dead port of capitalism; eliminating counter-revolutionaries is what the people demand, but Huang Shaohong keeps saying "mistakes were made"; we believe that the people's democratic system is better than the bourgeois parliamentary system, but the rightists "flock and flutter over the wall, suspecting spring is in the neighbor's yard."

    However, no matter how the rightists use flowery language to disguise themselves as "true patriots" and "true leftists," they cannot deceive the "class struggle viewpoint" spectroscope. Under this ideological spectroscope, all kinds of anti-socialist remarks, in all their forms and guises, are revealed in their true colors.

    From the likes and dislikes of an individual and a group, we can indeed identify the ideological weapons of that individual and that group. As early as decades ago, Mr. Lu Xun, in his essay "We Are No Longer Deceived," used this weapon to distinguish between enemies and friends. "Imperialism and us, apart from its lackeys, what interest is not exactly the opposite of ours? Our boils are their treasures, so their enemies are of course our friends." (Collection of Southern Accents and Northern Tones) Today, the rightists, according to their guideline: "Hate what the Communist Party likes; like what the Communist Party hates," hate what the Communist Party and the people like—socialism, and like what the Communist Party and the people hate—capitalism. We should draw a lesson from this and do the opposite: "Hate what the rightists like; like what the rightists hate."

    "Captured by the Rightists"
    K. Yue
    Some rightists say that the reason they have statements and actions against socialism and the Communist Party is that they were tricked by the rightists, that they were captured by the rightists. This reminds me of a story of a prisoner in the history of the transition from the Ming to the Qing Dynasty in our country.

    Hong Chengchou was originally a general of the Ming Dynasty, leading a large army to defend the Jinzhou, Songshan, and Xingshan line, in order to defend the Ming Dynasty, which was highly valued by the Ming court. However, he became a prisoner in the battle with the Qing army. It is said that at the beginning, he was unwilling to surrender, and even fasted to express his determination. After hearing the legend that he had "given his life," Emperor Chongzhen, Zhu Youjian, not only wore plain clothes to express his condolences, but also ordered the whole country to "wear mourning" to commemorate his "loyalty." Who knew that this Hong Chengchou had already surrendered, and was still using his past "reputation" to recruit surrenders along the way when the Qing army entered the customs in a large scale, so that he became a "great contributor" to helping the Qing feudal rulers restore the Ming Dynasty.

    Can historians still forgive such "prisoners" when writing the history of the Ming and Qing Dynasties, and not subject them to "verbal criticism"? I think this is not possible.

    横眉小集
    所好与所恶
    王重
    右派分子马哲民在整风中教唆他的党羽：“党所好恶之，党所恶，好之。”这一句话，画龙点睛地概括了一切资产阶级右派分子的言行。
    所好与所恶的确是代表各人的阶级立场的。帝国主义是我们的死敌，右派分子孟昭英巴不得有个美国人来做总统；社会主义是人民向往的，右派分子却想把新中国的大船开进资本主义的死港；肃清反革命是人民的要求，但黄绍竑却口口声声说“搞错了”；我们认为人民民主制度比资产阶级议会制好，右派分子却“蜂蝶纷纷过墙去，却疑春色在邻家”。
    但是，不论右派分子怎样花言巧语，把自己打扮得像个“真正的爱国者”和“真正的左派”，无论如何不能蒙蔽“阶级斗争观点”的分光镜，在这个思想的分光镜下，五花八门、形形色色的反社会主义言论都露出了原形。
    从一个人和一个集团的好恶，确实是鉴定这个人和这个集团的思想武器。鲁迅先生早在几十年之前，在“我们不再受骗了”的杂文中，就运用了这个武器，鉴别了敌人和朋友。“帝国主义和我们，除了它的奴才之外，那一样利害不和我们正相反？我们的瘫疽，是它们的宝贝，那么，它们的敌人，当然是我们的朋友了。”（南腔北调集）今天，右派分子根据他们的行动指南：“共产党所好，恶之；共产党所恶，好之。”恶共产党和人民之所好——社会主义，好共产党和人民之所恶——资本主义，我们正应该从此得出一个教训，来它一个相反：“右派分子所好，恶之；右派分子所恶，好之。”
    “做了右派的俘虏”
  　克约
    有些右派分子说，他之所以有反对社会主义与反对共产党的言行，是上了右派的当，是为右派所俘虏。从这，倒使我联想起我国明清之交历史上一件俘虏的故事来了。
    洪承畴原是明朝大将，率重兵防守锦州、松山、杏山一线，以捍卫明朝江山，甚为明室所倚重，他却在同清兵作战中当了俘虏。据说在开始时还不肯投降，甚至绝食以表示决心。崇祯皇帝朱由检还在听到他已“尽节”的传说之后，不独自己素服志哀，而且还通令全国“挂孝”来追悼他的“忠义”。谁知这个洪承畴却已投降了，而还在清兵大举入关时，利用他过去的“声誉”沿途招降，以致成为帮助清朝封建统治者复亡明室的一个“大功臣”。
    这样的“俘虏”历史家在写明清史的时候是否还能有所原谅，而不予以“口诛笔伐”？我意，这样是不可以的。
