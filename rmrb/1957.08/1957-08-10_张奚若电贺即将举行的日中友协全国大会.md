Xinhua News Agency, 9th - Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, today sent a telegram to the upcoming 7th National Congress of the Japan-China Friendship Association, to be held on the 17th of this month, expressing congratulations.
    The telegram stated that Sino-Japanese friendship is the common aspiration of the people of both countries. Any intention to be hostile to China, to undermine the friendly relations between our two peoples, to disrupt the unity of Asian countries, and to follow the U.S. policy of aggression is not only contrary to the interests of the entire Japanese nation and to peace in the Orient, but is also doomed to failure. Your association has made great efforts and achieved great results in promoting Sino-Japanese friendship and cooperation in the past. We believe that this congress will further enhance the friendship between the two peoples, develop economic and cultural exchanges, and thus contribute to the early restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries and the defense of lasting peace in the Far East. We wish the congress a victorious success.

    张奚若电贺即将举行的日中友协全国大会
    新华社9日讯　中国人民外交学会会长张奚若今天致电将在本月17日举行的日本日中友好协会第七次全国大会，表示祝贺。
    电报说，中日友好是两国人民的共同愿望。任何敌视中国、破坏我们两国人民的友好关系、破坏亚洲国家团结、追随美国侵略政策的意图，不但和日本整个民族的利益和东方和平相违背，并且是注定要失败的。贵会在过去为推进中日友好合作已作了很大的努力，取得了很大的成绩，我们相信，这次大会将进一步增进两国人民的友谊，发展经济和文化的交流，从而有助于两国邦交的早日恢复和保卫远东持久和平。敬祝大会胜利成功。
