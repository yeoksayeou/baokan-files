Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 15th: Soviet Marshal Vasilevsky published an article in "Red Star" on August 14th, stating that the Soviet Union's military strength and its command of the most modern weapons (including atomic and thermonuclear weapons, long-range and super-long-range rockets) give it every reason to win any war, should the imperialist aggressors dare to launch a war against the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp.

Vasilevsky's article refutes the bellicose remarks of U.S. Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Burke. The article points out that Burke recently published an article in "This Week" magazine on the role of the Navy. The foolish and self-deceptive boasting in this article reached a dangerous level, leading Americans to fantasize that a victorious war by the United States against the Soviet Union would be "easy" and "safe."

Vasilevsky said that at present, after the experience of two world wars, this naval admiral of a country that boasts of "democracy" is criminally deceiving the public by insisting that in the age of atomic and thermonuclear weapons, a war can be won without losses to its own people.

Vasilevsky wrote: Burke's article makes no mention of the Soviet Union being second in the world in economic power, with resources that exceed the United States in many respects, and that its economic, social, and political system, as proven by the experience of the Second World War, guarantees it unparalleled superiority in the struggle against imperialist countries.

Vasilevsky said that the Soviet people, their government, and armed forces fully understand that a future war will bring endless disasters not only to the defeated countries but also to the victors. Therefore, the Soviet people, including the military, are enthusiastically fighting for peace and preventing war. Marshal Vasilevsky wrote that it is not weakness, but our strength and our progressive ideology that determine this peace-loving stance.

Vasilevsky then refuted Burke's bellicose remarks that "if there is a war, we can try to keep it far away from the United States." Vasilevsky pointed out that in the age of atomic weapons, no fleet can protect its territory from attacks by modern rocket weapons and strategic air force. Therefore, Burke's statement is nothing more than irresponsible bragging, which is by no means in the interests of the people of all countries and the cause of peace. Its purpose is to prepare ideologically for a war of aggression.

Vasilevsky concluded by writing that the way to prevent atomic war does not lie in advocating that one can easily subdue one's enemies, but primarily and foremost in achieving mutual understanding and trust between countries.

### 华西列夫斯基斥美国将军好战言论  美国侵略他国而本身不受损失全是鬼话

    华西列夫斯基斥美国将军好战言论
    美国侵略他国而本身不受损失全是鬼话
    新华社莫斯科15日电  苏联元帅华西列夫斯基8月14日在“红星报”上发表文章说，苏联的军事威力和它所掌握的最现代化武器（其中包括原子武器和热核武器、远射程和超远射程火箭），使它有一切根据可以赢得一切战争，如果帝国主义侵略者胆敢对苏联和整个社会主义阵营发动战争的话。
    华西列夫斯基的文章是驳斥美国海军作战参谋长伯克海军上将的好战言论的。文章指出，不久前，伯克在“这一周”杂志上发表了一篇论海军作用的文章。这篇文章中愚蠢的自欺欺人的吹牛达到了危险的程度，它使美国人幻想美国对苏联进行必胜的战争是“轻而易举的”和“安全可靠的”。
    华西列夫斯基说，在目前，当有了两次世界大战的经验之后，以“民主”自我吹嘘的国家的这位海军上将竟罪恶地欺骗公众，硬说在原子武器和热核武器时代，也可以在本国人民不受损失的情况下赢得战争。
    华西列夫斯基写道：伯克在文章中闭口不谈苏联在经济威力方面居世界第二位，它的资源在许多方面超过美国，而它的经济、社会、政治制度正如第二次世界大战经验所证明的，保证它在同帝国主义国家斗争中有无比的优越地位。
    华西列夫斯基说，苏联人民、他们的政府和武装部队十分懂得，未来的战争不仅会给战败国而且也会给战胜国带来无穷的灾难。因此，苏联人，包括军人在内，热情地为争取和平和防止战争而斗争。华西列夫斯基元帅写道，不是软弱，而是我们的力量、我们的进步意识形态决定了这种爱好和平的立场。
    华西列夫斯基接着驳斥了伯克所鼓吹的“如果有战争，我们可以尽量使它在远离美国的地方进行”的好战言论。华西列夫斯基指出，在原子武器时代，任何舰队都不能保卫本国领土不遭到现代化火箭武器和战略空军的袭击。因此，伯克的说法不是别的，而是不负责的吹嘘，这决不符合各国人民和和平事业的利益。它的目的是给侵略战争作思想准备。
    华西列夫斯基最后写道，防止原子战争的道路并不在于鼓吹可以很容易地制服自己的敌人，而首先的、主要的是在于国和国之间达成相互谅解和互相信任。
