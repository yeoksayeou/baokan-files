Carry the Anti-Rightist Struggle Through to the End
Du Qinghua, Professor of Tsinghua University

The "Several Opinions on Issues Concerning China's Scientific System" published by the China Democratic League in Guangming Daily on June 9th is a thorough anti-Party and anti-socialist scientific work program. I will now only talk about my personal opinions on the so-called "protection of scientists" issue in this reactionary program.

First of all, the so-called "protection of scientists" slogan in this reactionary program is not only a reckless and alarmist proposition that disregards the facts, but also, judging from the overall spirit of the opinion letter, this so-called "protection of scientists" is essentially to "protect" intellectuals from accepting socialist transformation. In this reactionary program, the rightists used some specific issues to cater to the emotions of some intellectuals who, for the sake of face or lingering attachment to the old "self-righteousness," did not want to be transformed. In fact, the vast majority of intellectuals, after years of continuous education by the Party, have realized that they must actively carry out self-transformation; and the anti-socialist scientific program is attacking precisely this positive aspect of the intellectuals.

Taking the "time issue" as an example. Due to the weakness of China's scientific foundation (including human resources), coupled with the fact that most scientists' thinking lags behind the development of society, this requires us to not only quickly delve into new sciences, but also tenaciously carry out ideological transformation, including necessary social activities, and neither should be neglected. This issue, reflected in the personal lives of scientists, is how to properly arrange time. That is to say, scientists once felt that there was insufficient time for scientific research. The Party deeply appreciates the difficulties and anxieties of scientists, so under the conditions where things are ready (mainly after the ideological situation of intellectuals has undergone a basic transformation), it proposed ensuring scientists six-fifths of their professional work time. However, the time issue raised by people like Zeng Zhaolun and Qian Weichang is an attempt to use the time issue to set politics and professional work against each other. For example, they propose that scientists can take long-term leave for social activities and administrative work. This kind of proposal that only focuses on professional work and ignores politics is extremely sinister. Its intention is to guide scientists to break away from socialist political life and gradually embark on the anti-socialist road that the rightists hope for.

Secondly, the rightists use the time issue as a trick to usurp the Party's leadership over science. On the one hand, they say that old scientists over the age of sixty should not be involved in administration; at the same time, they proclaim in another setting that "laymen" cannot lead "experts," that is to say, the Party cannot lead, and people who understand the profession should lead. In that case, only people like Zeng and Qian can lead. Because many scientists who are responsible for leadership in scientific institutions are currently over sixty years old, and leaders under sixty, if they are Party members (the "laymen" Zeng and Qian mentioned), are not eligible to lead. This is precisely Zeng and Qian's vicious strategy of opposing the Party's leadership and squeezing out old scientists.

Taking the "data issue" as another example. The actual content of the data issue mentioned in the reactionary scientific program is the issue of confidentiality of scientific data. The essence of this issue is: on the one hand, it distorts the Party's trust in intellectuals, and on the other hand, it destroys the confidentiality system to cater to personal interests. It is an aspect of opposing the scientific work that must be planned and have a division of labor. There have been some minor shortcomings in the confidentiality issue, and the Party has paid attention to this issue and improved it. In fact, it is not difficult for scientists to obtain confidential data within their own work scope now. Those who do practical technical scientific research work all feel this way. However, this cannot satisfy the wishes of people like Qian Weichang and Fei Xiaotong. What they want is to make all data public, for them to arbitrarily choose work that they think requires little labor and is easy to become famous. As for whether the Party trusts intellectuals, Qian Weichang himself can be taken as an example. Qian Weichang once slandered the Party before and after liberation, but as long as he expressed his desire for progress, the Party gave him great trust. The confidential data on China's construction and new technologies that he now possesses is extremely extensive. However, all that can be found in his remarks is his insult to the Yangtze River Bridge project; wanting Zhejiang Province to use the Qiantang River tidal power to generate electricity, instead of the Xin'an River hydropower project, based on his unscientific opinion. If many confidential data are provided to such scientists, in addition to being used by them for personal bragging and swindling, it will not play any role in developing science. Not to mention the serious consequences of leaking secrets.

Another example is the "return to team issue." We must ask, why return to the team? After liberation, the state carried out work to return engineering and technical personnel to their teams. This was a necessary process from the unreasonable arrangement of scientific and technical personnel in old China to the reasonable arrangement of socialist construction in new China. Does it mean that the arrangement of new China according to the requirements of socialist construction must now be "returned to the team" again according to the wishes of a few people? Today, raising the issue of "returning to the team" is essentially to disrupt the socialist arrangement of scientific work.

In the reactionary scientific program, the "focusing on the individual" viewpoint put forward in the issue of division of labor and cooperation, along with the arguments that scientific leadership should not be led by the Party, that we don't need locomotives, and that scientific work should be carried out spontaneously and in a decentralized manner, clearly shows that the rightists want to use the individualism of scientists to oppose the Party and oppose socialism. What is even more vicious is that on the issue of cultivating new forces, the rightists emphasize that political conditions are not needed, and they want to cultivate a second generation for bourgeois rightists. However, rightists, your calculations are wrong. You can take advantage of our temporary paralysis and failure to see the essence of the problem, but after studying, we have finally recognized your true colors. We must thoroughly expose the ugly and reactionary faces of the rightists and carry the anti-rightist struggle through to the end.

### 把反右派斗争进行到底

    把反右派斗争进行到底
    清华大学教授　杜庆华
    民盟6月9日在光明日报上发表的“对于有关我国科学体制问题的几点意见”是一个彻头彻尾的反党反社会主义的科学工作纲领。我现在只对反动纲领中所谓“保护科学家问题”谈谈我个人的意见。
    首先，这个反动纲领中的所谓“保护科学家”的口号，不仅是不顾事实和危言耸听的提法，而且从意见书统篇的精神来看，这个所谓“保护科学家”，实质上就是“保护”知识分子不接受社会主义改造。右派分子在这个反动纲领里，利用了一些具体问题，想去迎合一部分知识分子为了面子或留恋于旧的“自以为是”而不想改造的情绪。其实，绝大多数的知识分子，这几年来经过党的不断教育，都认识到必须积极进行自我改造；而反社会主义的科学纲领进攻的却正是知识分子这个积极的一面。
    以“时间问题”为例。由于我国科学基础（包括人力）的薄弱，再加上大多数科学家思想落后于社会的发展，这就使我们一方面要赶快进一步钻研新的科学，同时还必须顽强地进行思想改造，其中包括必要的社会活动，二者不能偏废。这个问题反映在科学家个人生活中，就是如何妥善地安排时间的问题。也就是科学家曾经在一个时期感到科学工作研究时间不足。党深切体会到科学家的困难和焦虑，所以在条件具备的情况下（主要是知识分子思想情况有了基本的转变后），提出了保证科学家六分之五的业务工作时间。但是，曾昭抡、钱伟长之流所提出来的时间问题，却是企图利用时间问题来使政治和业务对立起来。例如他们提出科学家可以对社会活动和行政工作长期请假。这种只搞业务不管政治的提法，是极其阴险的。它的企图在于引导科学家脱离社会主义政治生活，逐步走上右派分子所希望的反对社会主义的道路。
    其次，右派利用时间问题来作为他们篡夺党对科学领导的权术。他们一方面说六十岁以上的老科学家不应过问行政；同时在另一场合又宣扬“外行”不能领导“内行”，也就是说党不能领导，要懂业务的人来领导。这样那就只有由曾、钱之流来领导了。因为目前不少科学机关负有领导责任的科学家大都在六十岁以上，而六十岁以下的领导者倘若是党员（曾钱所谓的“外行”）都在不能领导之列。这正是曾、钱反对党的领导和排挤老科学家的恶毒策略。
    再以“资料问题”为例。反动科学纲领所提到的资料问题的实际内容，是科学资料保密问题。这一问题的实质：一方面是把党对知识分子的信任加以曲解，另一方面是破坏保密制度以迁就个人兴趣。是反对科学工作必须有计划、有分工的一个方面。保密问题中曾有一些小的缺点，党已经注意这一问题并加以改进。事实上，现在科学家在自己工作范围内所要取得的保密资料是并不困难的。做实际技术科学研究工作的人都有此感。但是，这样并不能满足钱伟长、费孝通之流的愿望。他们所要的是将一切资料公开，供他们个人任意凭兴趣来选择他们认为花劳动力不大而又易于出名的工作。至于党是否信任知识分子，可以钱伟长本人为例。钱伟长在解放前后曾对党进行过污蔑，但是只要他表示了进步的愿望，党就给予了他极大的信任。他现在所掌握的我国建设和新技术的机密资料，是极其广泛的。可是从他的言论中所能找到的，只不过是他对长江大桥工程的侮蔑；要浙江省根据他那毫无科学根据的意见用钱塘江潮水发电，以代替新安江水力发电工程。如果把许多保密资料供给这样的科学家，除了供他们个人利用作吹嘘和招摇撞骗之外，并不起任何发展科学的作用。更不用说失密的严重后果了。
    又如“归队问题”。我们必须问，为什么要归队。解放后国家对工程技术人员曾进行了归队工作。这是从旧中国对科学技术人员不合理的安排，到新中国社会主义建设的合理安排的必要过程。难道说新中国根据社会主义建设要求的安排，现在又必须根据少数人的愿望再来进行“归队”？今天提出“归队”的问题，实质上是要破坏社会主义的对科学工作的安排。
    在反动科学纲领中分工协作问题中提出的“就人”观点，同科学领导上的不要党的领导、不要火车头、要自发、分散地进行科学工作的论调里可以明显地看出，右派分子是想利用科学家的个人主义情绪，来反对党，反对社会主义。更恶毒的是在培养新生力量这个问题上，右派分子强调不要政治条件，要为资产阶级右派分子培养第二代。不过右派分子你们的算盘打错了，你们可以利用我们一时的麻痹和看不清问题的实质，但是经过学习，我们毕竟认清了你们的真面目。我们一定要彻底揭露右派分子的丑恶反动面目，把反右派的斗争进行到底。
