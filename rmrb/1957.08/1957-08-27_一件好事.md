A Good Deed
　　Yu Feng

People who travel for work are often troubled by waiting for buses and changing boats during their journeys. In April of this year, I traveled from Qimen County back to Hefei. The bus arrived in Wuhu at midnight, but the ship from Wuhu was not scheduled to depart until after five in the morning. Having sat on the last row of the bus for a whole day, I really wanted to find a place to rest while waiting for the ship, but all the hotels near the shipping company were closed. In fact, based on experience, even if they were open, there would be no vacancies at this time. I had no choice but to return to the waiting area and sit on my luggage, enduring the half-night. I thought, it would be so good if there was a place for travelers to rest temporarily!

Recently, when I went to Bengbu, I had to wait for a train at night again. I walked out of the station unhappily to stroll around. Unexpectedly, I saw a Victory Teahouse across from the station, with bright electric lights inside. Sichuan people have a native attachment to teahouses. Being able to sit in a teahouse while waiting for a train at night is truly wonderful. Going inside, I saw that it was different from ordinary teahouses. Inside, there were neat rows of bamboo beds, each with a towel spread on it, and a small tea table next to the bed, a layout similar to that of an ordinary bathhouse. On the beds, there were travelers playing cards, playing chess, reading books, and sleeping soundly. The waiters quietly poured tea back and forth. People looked relaxed and comfortable, completely different from the anxious and tired scene in the station waiting room.

I asked the comrade serving in the teahouse what was going on. She told me that Bengbu is the intersection of the Huainan and Jinpu Railways. Trains heading south and north come and go endlessly, and it is also a water transportation hub in the middle reaches of the Huai River, with buses to various parts of northern Anhui. There are many travelers waiting to change trains and boats. In the past, if they wanted to rest, they had to stay in hotels. Hotels were too crowded, and travelers had to pay a full day's hotel fee even if they only rested for a few hours; moreover, many hotels did not operate after midnight, which was very inconvenient for travelers. This teahouse is designed to provide temporary rest for transit passengers. It is open day and night. There are stoves for warmth in winter and electric fans in summer; the beds are free, only the tea is charged, one cup of tea is counted once every four hours, each time 15 cents, including water for washing face and feet; in addition, quilts are available for rent. In addition to serving tea, when travelers enter the teahouse, the staff asks which train they need to catch and notes it on the blackboard, and is responsible for waking them up when the time comes. During the day, they can also purchase train tickets for travelers. In this way, travelers can sleep peacefully without worrying about missing their train.

The person in charge of the teahouse said that the main furniture of the teahouse, such as small bamboo beds, tea tables, electric fans, etc., were surplus items from various bathhouses in the city. The total cost, including repairing the house, buying towels and teacups, etc., was only 1,500 yuan. The whole teahouse has seventy-nine beds and receives hundreds of travelers every day, sometimes reaching more than a thousand.

How was this teahouse established? The person in charge of the teahouse continued to tell me: Wang Yu, the secretary of the Bengbu Municipal Party Committee, once went out for work and couldn't find a hotel after getting off the train at night, so he had to borrow a chair and sit in the open air for half the night to rest. Comrade Wang Yu personally felt the difficulties of travelers waiting to change trains and boats, and upon returning, he advocated the establishment of such a teahouse in Bengbu.

In the teahouse, I saw travelers constantly coming and going. Those who had rested well, drank good tea, washed their faces, and went on the train in batches. I thought: Running this teahouse is really a good deed. The Municipal Party Committee Secretary sat on a chair and waited for a train in the middle of the night, and solved such a problem that needed to be solved for travelers. This shows the great significance of the Party's advocacy of leaders sharing weal and woe with the masses. (Attached picture)

　　一件好事
　　于风
    出外工作的人，常常为旅途中等车换船而苦恼。今年4月我从祁门县回合肥，汽车到达芜湖时已半夜，由芜湖开船却要到早晨五点以后。在汽车最后一排已整整坐了一天，真想在等船的时候找个地方去休息一下，但轮船公司附近的旅馆都关门了。其实，按照经验，就是不关门这时也不会有空铺。我只好回到等船的地方，在行李上坐着，挨过这半个夜晚。我想，有个让旅客们临时休息的地方该多好啊！
    最近到蚌埠，我又得夜里等车。我不愉快地走出车站蹓跶。不意竟在车站对面看见一个胜利茶社，屋里电灯明晃晃的。四川人对茶馆本来就有乡土情感，夜里等车还能坐茶馆，真是再写意不过了。走进去一看，原来和普通茶社不一样。里面整整齐齐的摆着一排排的凉床，床上铺着一块毛巾，床旁有个小茶几，那种摆设就像普通的浴室。床上有打扑克的、下棋的、看书的和躺着熟睡的旅客。服务员轻轻地来回倒茶。人们显得安闲舒适，和坐在车站候车室焦躁疲困的情景完全两样。
    我向茶社的服务员同志探问，这究竟是怎么回事。她告诉我，蚌埠是淮南、津浦路的交叉点，南下北上的火车穿流不息，又是淮河中流的水码头，还有汽车通淮北各地，等换车船的旅客很多。过去，他们想休息，就只好住旅馆。旅馆一来太挤，二来旅客休息几个钟头也得花一整天的旅馆费；再说，很多旅馆半夜十二点以后又不营业，旅客很不方便。这个茶社就是为过境旅客暂时休息服务的。它昼夜不歇。屋里冬天有火炉保暖，夏天还有电扇；床位不要钱，只算茶水钱，一杯茶四小时算一次，每次一角五分钱，洗脸洗脚水在内；此外还有被子出租。服务员除供应茶水外，当旅客进茶社时，就问清楚旅客要赶哪一班的车走，记在黑板上，到时候负责叫醒旅客，白天还可代旅客订购车票。这样，旅客就可安心睡觉，不怕误车。
    茶社的负责人说，茶社的主要家具小凉床、茶几、电扇等等，都是市内各澡堂多余下来的。连修缮房屋、买毛巾、茶杯等一共才花了一千五百元。全茶社有七十九个床位，每天接待旅客，少者数百，多时能达到一千以上。
    这个茶社是怎样开办起来的呢？茶社的负责人接着告诉我：蚌埠市委书记王宇同志有一次出外工作，夜里下车后找不到旅馆，只好借一张椅子坐在露天里休息了半夜。王宇同志亲身感到了旅客等换车船的困难，回来就倡议在蚌埠办了这么个茶社。
    我在茶社看到旅客不断的来，那些休息好的旅客，喝好茶，洗好脸，又一批批的上车去了。我想：办这个茶社，真是一件好事。市委书记半夜坐在椅子上等等车，就为旅客解决了这么需要解决的问题，可见党所提倡的领导要和群众同甘共苦的重大意义了。（附图片）
