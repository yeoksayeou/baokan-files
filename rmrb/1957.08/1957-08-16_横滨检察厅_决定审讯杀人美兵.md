Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 15th: The Yokohama District Prosecutor's Office in Japan yesterday rejected the Yokosuka Branch of the Yokohama Court's verdict of not guilty for an American soldier who shot and killed a Japanese person, and decided to prosecute this American murderer.

	This American soldier, named Adolf Merten, was drinking in a restaurant in Yokosuka City last October when he suddenly shot and killed a young Japanese man, Kowa Shiro, who was drinking with American officers.

	After the incident, the Yokosuka Branch of the Yokohama Court acquitted this American murderer on the grounds that Merten was "mentally deranged" at the time.

    横滨检察厅
    决定审讯杀人美兵
    新华社15日讯  东京消息：日本横滨地方检察厅昨天否定横滨裁判所横须贺分所对一名枪杀日本人的美国兵宣告无罪的判决，并且决定对这个美国杀人犯提起诉讼。
    这个名叫阿道夫·默滕的美国兵在去年10月在横须贺市的一家饮食店里喝酒时，突然开枪打死了一个同美国军官在一起喝酒的日本青年高和四郎。
    事件发生后，横滨裁判所横须贺分所以默滕当时“精神失常”为理由，宣判这个美国杀人犯无罪。
