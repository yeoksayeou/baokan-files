Surveying the Qilianshan Gorge

A major project in the overall planning for the utilization of the Yellow River—the Qilianshan Gorge comprehensive hydraulic hub—is currently being surveyed.

The Qilianshan Gorge is located in Gansu Province between Zhongwei and Jingtai. In this area, the Yellow River is flanked by steep cliffs. In narrow sections, the river is only tens of meters wide. The Qilianshan Gorge, which stretches for over 70 kilometers, has turbulent waters and abundant hydropower resources, making it suitable for the construction of large-scale hydropower stations.

    勘测黑山峡
    黄河综合利用规划中一个重大的工程——黑山峡综合性水力枢纽，正在进行勘测。
    黑山峡在甘肃省境内中卫与景泰之间，这一带黄河两岸峭壁陡立，河面窄的地方只有数十公尺，七十多公里长的黑山峡里河水汹涌澎湃，水力资源非常丰富，可以建设大型水电站。
