Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, August 17th: The Syrian government announced on the 16th that the cabinet had appointed Alif Bizri as Commander-in-Chief of the Syrian Armed Forces and Chief of Staff of the Army, replacing Toufik Nizamuddin, who had requested retirement.

Bizri was originally the Director of the First Department of the Syrian General Staff. He was promoted from Brigadier General to Major General upon being appointed to his new position. Bizri has consistently taken a patriotic stance and is a qualified military man.

According to the new appointments, Brigadier General Amin Niffouri, Director of the Third Department of the General Staff, will serve as Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army, Brigadier General Jamal Faisal will serve as Acting Commander of the Gendarmerie, and Abdullah Jasoumah will serve as Director of the General Police Department.

According to Damascus newspapers, after the exposure of the American attempt to subvert the current Syrian government, the Syrian cabinet decided to take the necessary measures to safeguard the country's independence. Nizamuddin requested retirement with a pension the day after this decision was made.

On the 15th, the Syrian cabinet also decided to relieve Hussein of his duties as military attache in Rome. Hussein twice refused to obey the government's order to return to Damascus and attempted to deny his crimes.

Atiyah detailed what Hussein told him during their meeting regarding plans to subvert the current Syrian government. Atiyah also confirmed that an official from the American embassy asked him to assassinate a group of Syrian military and political leaders, including Akram Hourani, leader of the Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party, Hamid Sarraj, Director of the Second Department of the General Staff, and Alif Bizri, Director of the First Department.

    叙利亚更动军警首脑
    颠覆分子证实美国策划暗杀活动
    据新华社大马士革17日电  叙利亚政府16日宣布，内阁已经任命阿利夫·比兹赖赫为叙利亚武装部队总司令兼陆军参谋长，以代替要求退休的图菲克·尼扎姆丁。
    比兹赖赫原来是叙利亚总参谋部第一处处长，他在被任命新职务的同时由准将晋升为少将。比兹赖赫一贯采取爱国立场，并且是个合格的军人。
    根据新的任命，总参谋部第三处处长阿明·尼福里准将担任陆军副参谋长，贾马勒·费萨尔准将担任代理宪兵总司令，阿卜杜拉·贾苏马赫担任警察总局局长。
    据大马士革报纸报道，在美国企图颠覆叙利亚现政府的阴谋被揭发以后，叙利亚内阁决定采取必要的措施以维护国家的独立。在作出这项决定以后的第二天，尼扎姆丁要求领年金退休。
    叙利亚内阁15日还决定解除驻罗马武官侯赛尼的职务。侯赛尼两次拒绝服从政府要他回大马士革的命令，并且企图否认自己的罪行。
    大马士革电台15日广播了参加揭发反政府阴谋案的一个叙利亚军官——阿卜杜拉·阿提亚上尉的讲话录音。阿提亚详细叙述了侯赛尼在同他会见时告诉他的关于企图颠覆叙利亚现政府的一些谋划。阿提亚还证实，美国大使馆的一个官员要他去暗杀一批叙利亚的军、政领导人，其中包括阿拉伯复兴社会党领袖阿克拉姆·胡拉尼，总参谋部第二处处长哈米德·萨拉杰和第一处处长阿利夫·比兹赖赫。
