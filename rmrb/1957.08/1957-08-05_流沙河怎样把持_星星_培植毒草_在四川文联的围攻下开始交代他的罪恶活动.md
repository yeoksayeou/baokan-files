Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 4th - Under the exposure and accusation of the staff of the Sichuan Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the rightist Liu Shahe recently confessed to his criminal activities of forming an anti-Party alliance with Shi Tianhe, another rightist in the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, to seize the leadership of the "Stars" poetry journal in a planned way, and to attack the Communist Party.

"Stars" is a poetry monthly founded by the Sichuan Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles in January of this year. After Liu Shahe and others actively entered "Stars" as editors, they turned "Stars" into a "battlefield" against the Communist Party and against socialist realism; and under the guise of "cultivation," they wooed and contacted a group of young people. They published sensational calls for submissions and advertisements everywhere. In the calls for submissions, they expressed a very welcome attitude towards various schools of poetry such as romanticism, but they never mentioned socialist realism.

Liu Shahe admitted that their editorial policy at the time was: 1. Publish more "satirical poems" that distort and oppose the Communist Party; 2. Publish more love poems that promote decadent and sentimental emotions; 3. Publish more exquisite gadgets to guide readers away from politics and reality. After the publication of the erotic poem "Kiss" and the reactionary poem "Grass and Trees" in the inaugural issue of "Stars" were criticized, Liu Shahe, Shi Tianhe and others were filled with hatred and immediately organized a counterattack, using the banner of implementing the "Let a hundred flowers bloom" policy to oppose the leadership of the Party.

Liu Shahe admitted that at that time, they adopted five methods to attack the Communist Party. First, "write": they wrote many articles to slander and intimidate the Party, or to "settle accounts" with the Party; second, "scold"; third, release poisonous weeds, attempting to publish in "Stars" some reactionary poems that attack the new society and erotic lyrics that are even worse than "Kiss." Shi Tianhe also taught Liu Shahe to use "underground struggle" methods to secretly insert fillers in the magazine to satirize and attack the Party; fourth, incite others to attack the Party; fifth, expand influence, they once conspired to print and distribute nationwide the anti-criticism articles they wrote attacking the Party. Shi Tianhe also directed Liu Shahe to spread rumors everywhere, saying that "Stars" was being besieged, etc.

Bai Hang, the editor-in-chief of "Stars" poetry journal, is a rightist within the Party. Shi Tianhe and Liu Shahe tried to win him over and influence him in many ways, provoking Bai Hang's dissatisfaction with the Party. They used Bai Hang to resist the Party's leadership, but they were unwilling for Bai Hang to manage the journal too much, so they adopted a two-faced approach of both wooing and squeezing out. Bai Hang fully accepted the reactionary editorial policy of Liu Shahe and others, and together with Liu Shahe opposed the Party's transfer of new editors to strengthen the "Stars" editorial department. In this way, "Stars" completely fell into the hands of this gang of rightists.

Now, the staff of the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles are taking advantage of the victory to pursue and attack, demanding that Liu Shahe and others thoroughly confess all their conspiracies of colluding with each other and acting as accomplices.

### 流沙河怎样把持“星星”培植毒草  在四川文联的围攻下开始交代他的罪恶活动

    流沙河怎样把持“星星”培植毒草
    在四川文联的围攻下开始交代他的罪恶活动
    新华社成都4日电　在四川省文学艺术工作者联合会工作人员的检举揭发下，右派分子流沙河最近交代了他和省文联的另一右派分子石天河结成反党联盟，有计划地篡夺“星星”诗刊领导权，向共产党进攻的罪恶活动。
    “星星”是四川省文联在今年1月创办的诗歌月刊。流沙河等经过积极活动进入“星星”充当编辑后，就把“星星”作为反对共产党反对社会主义现实主义的“阵地”；并假借“培养”为名，拉拢和联络一批青年人。他们到处刊登耸人听闻的稿约和广告。在稿约中，他们对浪漫主义等各种流派的诗歌都表示非常欢迎，但绝口不提社会主义现实主义。
    流沙河承认，他们当时的编辑方针是：一、多登歪曲和反对共产党的“讽刺诗”；二、多登宣扬颓废感伤情绪的情诗；三、多登小巧玲珑的玩意，引导读者脱离政治、脱离现实。当“星星”创刊号上刊出的黄色诗歌“吻”和反动诗“草木篇”受到批评后，流沙河、石天河等满怀仇恨，立即组织反扑，打着执行“百花齐放”方针的幌子来反对党的领导。
    流沙河承认，当时他们采用了五种手段来向共产党进攻。一、“写”，他们写了好些文章对党进行污蔑和恐吓，或者向党“算总账”；二、“骂”；三、是放毒草，企图在“星星”上刊出一些攻击新社会的反动诗和比“吻”还坏的黄色词。石天河还教导流沙河用“地下斗争”办法在刊物中偷放补白，对党进行讽刺、攻击；四、煽动别人向党进攻；五、扩大影响，他们曾密谋把他们写的攻击党的反批评文章印发全国。石天河还支使流沙河四出造谣，说“星星”被围剿等。
    “星星”诗刊主编白航是党内的右派分子。石天河、流沙河就多方拉拢和影响他，挑动白航对党的不满情绪。他们利用白航来抵制党的领导，但又不愿白航对刊物管得太多，于是采取了既拉拢、又排挤的两面手法。白航完全接受了流沙河等反动的编辑方针，并同流沙河一起反对党为加强“星星”编辑部而调进新的编辑人员。这样，“星星”就完全落入了这一伙右派分子的手中。
    现在，省文联工作人员正乘胜追击，要流沙河等彻底交代他们互相勾结、狼狈为奸的一切阴谋活动。
