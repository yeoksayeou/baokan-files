Sharing Weal and Woe with the People in Disaster Areas
Henan Decides to Tighten Urban Grain Consumption

    (Our Newspaper News) The Henan Provincial People's Committee issued a "Directive on Conserving Grain in Cities" on July 27, calling on urban residents to conserve grain to support disaster areas.

    The directive stated that summer grain crops in our province have suffered from disasters this year, resulting in reduced production. Since July, continuous heavy rains in some areas have made the reduction in autumn grain production a certainty. In the face of this situation, all possible grain must be conserved everywhere.

    The directive stated that cadres in government organizations and military officers should save one tael of grain per person per day based on current standards. There should be different requirements for laborers of different natures. Grain used by the food industry should also be compressed. Grain used for copying should be maintained at last year's level. The directive also required that the flour extraction rate of processed wheat be increased from the current 88% to 95%.

    The directive stated that conserving grain in cities is not only an important economic measure to solve the problem of insufficient grain and is related to the lives of every resident, but also a concrete embodiment of the spirit of cities supporting disaster areas and sharing weal and woe with the masses of disaster victims. It has great political significance for strengthening the worker-peasant alliance and strengthening urban-rural relations. Therefore, all localities must conduct in-depth publicity to truly make grain conservation a conscious and practical action of the broad masses of people. In the publicity, it is also necessary to prevent creating an artificial atmosphere of tension.

    与灾区人民同甘共苦
    河南决定紧缩城市粮食消费量
    本报讯　河南省人民委员会于7月27日发出“关于城市节约粮食的指示”，号召城市人民节约粮食支援灾区。
    指示说，我省今年夏季粮食作物遭灾减产，7月以来，部分地区连降暴雨，秋季粮食减产已成定局。面对这一情况，各地必须节约一切可能节约的粮食。
    指示说，机关团体的干部和部队军官，应按现行标准，每人每天节约粮食一两。对各种性质不同的劳动者，要有不同要求。食品业用粮也要加以压缩。复制业用粮，维持去年水平。指示还要求将加工小麦出粉率由现在的88％提高到95％。
    指示说，城市节约粮食，不仅是解决粮食不足问题和关系到每个居民生活的一项重要经济措施，也是具体体现城市支援灾区、与灾民群众同甘共苦的精神，它具有加强工农联盟、密切城乡关系的重大政治意义。因此，各地必须深入宣传，使节约粮食真正成为广大人民群众自觉的实际行动。在宣传中，也要防止造成人为的紧张空气。
