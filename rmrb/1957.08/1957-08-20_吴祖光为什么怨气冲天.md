Why is Wu Zuguang Filled with Resentment?
Lao She

When I first heard about Wu Zuguang's affairs, I felt some regret in my heart. But after I read the materials about his anti-Party and anti-socialist behavior, I was very angry and felt that knowing him in the past was an insult to me.

These past two days, I have often pondered this question: Why would Wu Zuguang become like this? After thinking about it, I remembered the line often used in "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio": "A handsome young gentleman of a turbid world." In the dirty old society, the ones who did bad and dirty things were these handsome "young gentlemen." Such people in "Strange Tales" hoped that foxes would turn into beautiful women and sleep with them. They thought all shameful things were fun, and everything was for their own enjoyment. Wu Zuguang is just such a person.

I know that Wu Zuguang often went to Guanghe Lou to listen to opera when he was young. At that time, there was a stinky urine pool outside this theater, and next to the pool was a tofu brain stall. Wu Zuguang appreciated the tofu brain here, and appreciated the stinky urine pool next to it. He appreciated the opera students standing aside who were being beaten and abused. He didn't care how stinky the urine pool was, nor did he care how painful the beaten and scolded elementary school students were; in any case, it was others who were suffering, and he was the one enjoying it. Indeed, he appreciated these things very much; he thought they were very poetic. It can be seen that Wu Zuguang had no sense of right and wrong in his heart. Because he himself couldn't distinguish between right and wrong, he also scolded our society for not distinguishing between right and wrong.

After national liberation, in our new society, human rights have been guaranteed, and elementary school students learning opera are no longer beaten and scolded. This is a very good thing. But Wu Zuguang was very indignant. He is just like that, never thinking about others. The day Guanghe Lou reopened, I also went. I was very excited, because Guanghe Lou had completely changed; the urine pool was gone. The current Guanghe Lou is spacious and clean. How civilized it is to watch opera in such a theater! But Wu Zuguang was not satisfied, and even indignant. He missed the old stench. Wu Zuguang's heart is so dirty, and his tastes are so low.

When Wu Zuguang saw that there were no cesspools, maggots, and abused elementary school students at the entrance of our society's theaters, he thought that our society was not interesting and restricted his freedom. I have read all of his recent articles, which are full of attacks and slanders against the new society. He is hostile to the new society. He wants to break through this "cage." He wants to find his spiritual world. His spiritual world is cesspools, maggots, and demons and monsters. But, unfortunately, our society is a society that distinguishes between right and wrong, a society of freedom and equality, without Wu Zuguang's kind of "freedom," and cannot satisfy his "tastes."

Wu Zuguang also misses the old theater backstage. In Chongqing, I also went to the backstage. Of course, Wu Zuguang had more opportunities to go to the backstage than I did, because his relationship with the theater circle was closer than mine. I once went to Mr. Ying Yunwei's troupe's backstage. I remember that on the day I went, two Kuomintang secret agents were also in the backstage, one wearing a Western suit, the other wearing Chinese clothing, both with pistols. They rushed around in the backstage, saying the most obscene things to the actors. At that time, the actors' faces turned pale with fright, but they still had to put on smiling faces and listen to their unbearable jokes. This was the backstage in the Kuomintang era. Wu Zuguang certainly saw even more than I did. But he liked this kind of backstage, appreciated those secret agents with guns, and appreciated those obscene jokes. He thought this kind of backstage was great, extremely warm, very dramatic, and the source of his creation. As for how the actors were bullied and teased, he didn't care. In any case, it was others who were suffering, and he was the one enjoying it. I can also give another example. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Bai Yang and other comrades went to Beibei to perform a play. They were about to go on stage, but the secret agents didn't allow it. They set up machine guns next to our backstage. If they opened fire, the directors and actors would all be killed. We had no choice. Later, we sent someone to fetch Comrade Yang Hansheng overnight to plead, because the local official was Comrade Yang Hansheng's student. This is how the problem was solved.

This was the backstage life, the actors' life, in the old society. It was so gloomy, so terrifying, so cruel! But Wu Zuguang appreciated that kind of life. When he saw that the current backstage no longer had secret agents, machine guns, and those dirty jokes, he was greatly dissatisfied and couldn't help but curse our new society.

In the materials, I saw: Wu Zuguang said that he wrote many scripts during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, but he didn't write a single play after liberation, proving that there shouldn't be leadership, proving that the new society restricted his creation. Is this really the case? I am older than him, have less energy than him, and am busier than him, but in these years after liberation, I have written several plays, while he hasn't written a single one. Why? Because I love this new society without a stinky urine pool in the theater, without secret agents and machine guns threatening the actors, while he is hostile to this society. This is the difference between the two of us. To be honest, those of us who came from the old society are not familiar enough with the new things, and old ideas often emerge. Therefore, writing new content is difficult for us. But what does it matter? We live in an era that produces heroes. Everyone can become a hero, and writers are no exception. It doesn't matter if you're old. Can't old workers in their fifties or sixties become labor models? Be called old heroes? Is there difficulty? Then overcome it! Regardless of whether I write well or not, I always do my best to write them. I write and sing praises of this great era with full enthusiasm. This is the source of my creation. But what about Wu Zuguang? He doesn't love this new society. New things are placed in front of him, but he is indifferent to them. Instead, he dislikes them and curses them. At the same time, the dirty things he loved in the old society are gone. Yes, of course he can't write anything. He can't write himself, so he has to blame the Communist Party for leading wrongly. But it's also strange. He and I are both under the leadership of the Party. I can write, but he can't. Is this really the Party's fault? Even if he is willing to write, he still wants to use his dirty heart to uglify the new society. No one wants this kind of "work." Therefore, he cannot but be filled with resentment.

Wu Zuguang used to disguise himself and play two-faced tricks. But in his recent articles and speeches, he finally spoke out the dirty things in his heart. Don't think that this is just a little bit of ideological disagreement that can be resolved with a self-criticism. No, it won't work. The facts since the anti-Rightist struggle have proven that ideological reaction will inevitably lead to further political reactionary activities. They hate this new society: Having become accustomed to living in cesspools, clean places are not suitable for them, and they can't stay there. They want to break through this "cage," so they must take action. Wu Zuguang's reactionary clique is an example. Comrades, don't be lenient, be vigilant!

Wu Zuguang, you "handsome young gentleman of a turbid world," had no way out in the past, and have even less of a way out now. The old society had cesspools, so maggots could live. Our society not only has no cesspools and no maggots, but even the flies will be wiped out. Wu Zuguang, turn back!

    吴祖光为什么怨气冲天
    老舍
    最初听到吴祖光的事情时，我心中有些惋惜。但当我看了有关他的反党、反社会主义的材料之后，我很气愤，觉得过去认识他真是对我的一种侮辱。
    这两天，我常思索这个问题：为什么吴祖光会变成这样呢？想来想去，我想起了“聊斋”上常常用的一句“翩翩浊世之佳公子也”。在肮脏的旧社会里，做坏事情、肮脏事情的就是这些漂亮的“佳公子”。这样的人在“聊斋”中，希望狐狸变成美女和自己同寝。他们觉得什么臭事都好玩，一切事都是供自己欣赏的。吴祖光正是这样的人。
    我知道吴祖光年轻的时候常到广和楼去听戏。那时候，这个戏园外有个臭尿池，池旁边有个豆腐脑摊。吴祖光欣赏这里的豆腐脑，欣赏一旁的臭气逼人的尿池。欣赏一旁站着的挨打受气的科班学生。他不管尿池怎样的臭，也不管挨打挨骂的小学生如何痛苦，反正受苦的是旁人，欣赏的是他自己。的确，他是很欣赏这些东西的，他认为这些很有诗意。可以看出，吴祖光心中是没有什么是非的。因为他自己不分是非，所以也就谩骂我们这个社会是非不分。
    全国解放之后，在我们的新社会里，人权得到了保障，学戏的小学生不再挨打挨骂了，这是很好的事情。可是吴祖光却很愤慨。他就是这样永远不为别人想什么的。广和楼重新开幕那天，我也去了，我很兴奋，因为广和楼完全变了，过去那个尿池没有了。现在的广和楼又宽敞又干净，在这样的戏院里看戏是多么的文明啊！可是吴祖光不满意，而且愤慨，他怀念过去那种臭味。吴祖光的心灵就是这样肮脏的，他的趣味也是如此低级的。
    当吴祖光见到我们这个社会的戏院门口没有粪坑、蛆虫和被虐待的小学生时，他就认为我们的这个社会没有趣味，限制了他的自由。他最近发表的几篇文章我都读了，全是攻击和诬蔑新社会的，他敌视新社会，他要冲破这个“牢笼”，他要找到他那个精神世界。他的精神世界就是粪坑、蛆虫、与牛鬼蛇神，但是，很可惜，我们这个社会是个是非分明的社会，是个自由平等的社会，没有吴祖光的那种“自由”，也不能满足他的“趣味”。
    吴祖光也留恋旧日剧场的后台。在重庆时，我也曾到过后台，当然，吴祖光到后台的机会比我多得多，因为他和戏剧界的关系比我密切。我曾去过应云卫先生的剧团的后台。记得我去的那天，国民党的两个特务也正在后台，一个穿着洋服，一个穿中装，都挂着手枪。他们在后台横冲直撞，对演员们讲着最淫秽的话。当时演员们的脸都吓白，但仍得装出笑脸听他们的不堪入耳的笑话。这就是国民党时代的后台，吴祖光当然要比我见过的更多了。可是他喜爱这样的后台，欣赏那些挂着枪的特务，欣赏那些淫秽的笑话。他认为这样的后台好极了，温暖极了，很有戏剧性，是他创作的泉源。至于演员如何被人家欺凌、被人家戏弄，他是不管的。反正受苦的是旁人，欣赏的是他自己。我还可以举一个例子，抗日战争时，白杨同志等到北碚演戏，马上就要上戏了，但特务们不允许。他们在我们后台台旁架起了机关枪。一开枪，导演、演员就会全被他们打死。我们没有办法，后来派人连夜去接阳翰笙同志来说情，因为地方官是阳翰笙同志的学生，这样才把问题解决了。
    这就是旧社会的后台生活，演员生活。那是多么阴森，多么恐怖，多么残酷！但吴祖光却欣赏那样的生活，当他见到现在的后台不再有特务、机关枪和那些污秽的笑话的时候，就大为不满，不能不咒诅我们的新社会。
    在材料里，我看到：吴祖光说，他在抗战八年写了好多剧本，而在解放后一个戏也没有写，证明不该有领导，证明新社会束缚了他的创作。事实真是这样吗？我年岁比他大，精力比他差，比他忙，但解放这些年来，我写了好几个戏，而他却一个也没写。为什么呢？因为我热爱这个没有臭尿池的剧场，没有特务和机枪威胁演员们的新社会，而他却敌视这个社会，这就是我俩的区别所在。老实说，我们这些旧社会过来的人，对新的事物不够熟悉，老思想又经常在冒出来。所以写新的内容，对我们说来，是有困难的。但这又有什么关系呢，我们生活在一个出英雄的时代，每个人都可能成为英雄，作家当然也不例外。年岁大了也没关系，五六十岁的老工人不是也能成为劳动模范吗？被称为老英雄吗？有困难吗？就去克服！不管我写得好不好，我总是尽自己最大力量把它们写成。我是怀着满腔热情去写、去歌颂我们这个伟大的时代的，这就是我的创作泉源。可是吴祖光呢？他不爱这个新社会。新的东西摆在他面前，他无动于衷，反而讨厌它们，诅咒它们。同时，他们喜爱那些旧社会的肮脏东西又没有了。是啊，他当然就写不出来什么了。他自己写不出来，只好怨恨共产党领导错了。可也奇怪，他与我都在党的领导下，我能写而他不能写，难道这真是党的错吗？即使他肯写，他也还想用他的肮脏心灵，丑化新社会。这种“作品”没有人要。于是，他不能不怨气冲天。
    吴祖光过去把自己伪装起来，玩弄两面派的手法。但他在近来的一些文章和发言中，终于把他心中的肮脏话说出来了。不要认为这是一点思想不对头，检讨一下就行了。不，不行的。自从反右派斗争以来的事实证明：思想上的反动，必然会进一步有政治上的反动活动。他们仇视这个新社会：在粪坑中生活惯了，干净的地方不适合他们，他们呆不下去了。他们要冲破这个“牢笼”，于是就必有所行动。吴祖光的反动小集团，就是一个例子。同志们，不能温情，要警惕啊！
    吴祖光，你这个“翩翩浊世的佳公子”，以前没有出路，现在更没有出路。旧社会有粪坑，所以蛆虫能够有生活。我们这个社会不但没有粪坑，没有蛆虫，连苍蝇也将打光。吴祖光，回头吧！
