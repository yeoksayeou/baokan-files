    Over Ten Thousand Junior High Graduates in Hebei Province
    Give Up Further Education, Intending to Return Home to Participate in Production
    (Our Newspaper) According to the Hebei Daily: Since the summer vacation, a group of primary and secondary school graduates in Hebei Province have voluntarily given up their plans for further education and returned to their hometowns to participate in agricultural labor, determined to become a new type of farmer. According to preliminary statistics, over ten thousand junior high school graduates alone have returned home. These educated youths have been properly resettled in most cases after returning home.
    In the recent period, Party and government leaders at all levels in Hebei Province have actively used various propaganda tools and forms to publicize the glory of labor and the great significance of actively resettling primary and secondary school graduates to the society and the students' parents, criticizing various incorrect ideas, and creating favorable conditions for educated youths who cannot continue their education to return home and participate in production. Hu Ziqi, the First Secretary of the Zhangbei County Party Committee, when conveying Chairman Mao's report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" at Zhangbei Middle School, focused on explaining the issue of further education and employment for primary and secondary school graduates, mobilizing primary and secondary school graduates who could not continue their education to return home and participate in agricultural production. Some counties in the Handan Special Zone adopted a method of propaganda with responsibility at each level, with district cadres covering townships, township cadres covering villages, and village cadres covering individuals, so that the propaganda work on further education and employment of primary and secondary school graduates reached every household.
    When these educated youths returned home to participate in agricultural labor, Party and government leaders in various places gave them send-offs, welcomed them, and made specific resettlement arrangements.
    Currently, some counties still have not grasped the work of resettling educated youths who have returned home tightly enough, remaining only at the level of instructions, lacking concrete organizational work. Some township and commune cadres even have concerns or find it troublesome to resettle students to participate in production. These issues should be brought to the attention of the leaders of each county and resolved as soon as possible.

    河北省一万多名初中毕业生
    放弃升学打算回乡参加生产
    本报讯　据河北日报消息：暑期以来，河北省有一批中小学毕业生已自愿放弃升学打算，回乡参加农业劳动，并决心作一个新式农民。据初步统计，仅回乡的初中毕业生就已有一万多名。这批知识青年回乡后，大都得到了妥善安置。
    近一个时期以来，河北省各级党政领导，积极运用各种宣传力量，通过各种形式，向社会上及学生家长宣传劳动光荣的道理和积极安置中小学毕业生的重大意义，批判各种不正确的思想，为不能升学的知识青年回乡参加生产创造了有利条件。中共张北县委第一书记胡子奇同志在张北中学传达毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告时，着重讲解了中小学毕业生的升学就业问题，动员不能升学的中小学毕业生回家参加农业生产。邯郸专区有的县采取了逐级负责的宣传办法，区干部包乡，乡干部包村，村干部包人，使中小学毕业生升学就业的宣传工作达到了家喻户晓。
    当这些知识青年回乡参加农业劳动的时候，各地党政领导对他们作了欢送、欢迎和具体安置工作。
    目前也还有些县对安置回乡知识青年的工作抓的不紧，只是停留在指示上，缺乏具体的组织工作。甚至有些乡社干部对安置学生参加生产，还有顾虑或嫌麻烦等思想。这些问题应该提起各县领导上注意，尽早解决。
