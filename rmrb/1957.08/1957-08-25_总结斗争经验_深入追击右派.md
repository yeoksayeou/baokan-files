　　Summarize Struggle Experience, Deepen the Pursuit of Rightists
    Anhui's Universities and Colleges Achieve Preliminary Victory in the Anti-Rightist Struggle
    The reactionary words and deeds of the rightists have been thoroughly refuted, and their shameless conspiracies and ugly faces have been nakedly exposed. The anti-Rightist struggle in various schools has come to a stage, and the leadership is summarizing the experience of the previous stage of the struggle. After the start of the next semester, it will continue to be carried out in depth.
    Wang Shouchang, a rightist in Anhui Medical College, openly defended Zhang Bojun and wanted to abolish the "school party committee system." Before liberation, he was the person in charge of the Three People's Principles Youth League of Tongji University, who kept blacklists and suppressed student movements. Gong Jiahu of Hefei Mining Institute, Shen Wenfu and Zhao Lunyi of Agricultural College, and Shen Xingzhi and Liu Lin of Hefei Normal School are all rightists with extremely serious bourgeois individualist ambitions. They used the organization of democratic parties to set fires everywhere, incite the masses, and viciously attack the Party in an attempt to seize leadership of the schools. Li Min, the "military advisor" of the rightists exposed in Anhui Normal College, was originally a traitor hidden within the Party; Tao Huazhang, who called himself "Marshal of the Army, Navy, and Air Force" and frantically attacked the Party, and Fei Delin, who engaged in counter-revolutionary activities and wrote reactionary slogans, were originally reactionary elements mixed in with the Communist Youth League.
    According to the materials exposed by various schools, most of these rightists were born in exploiting-class families. Many of their relatives were struggled against, controlled, and suppressed in social revolutionary movements. They themselves were not thoroughly reformed, and their reactionary class stance was not changed. Therefore, they frantically opposed the Party and socialism whenever they had the opportunity.

    Shenyang and Andong Middle Schools are Summarizing Struggle Experience
    The faculty and staff of fifty-seven middle schools in Shenyang and Andong are currently summarizing the experience of the previous stage of the anti-Rightist struggle in order to launch a further struggle.
    Starting in July, more than 3,800 middle school faculty and staff in the two cities have earnestly studied the relevant documents on the anti-Rightist struggle, held report meetings, forums, and debates, and ruthlessly exposed and criticized the rightists hidden in the education sector. The faculty and staff have been tempered in the struggle and have drawn a clear line between themselves and the rightists. They said: One month of struggle is better than several years of political lessons.
    Although the rightists exposed in various middle schools are of various types, their consistent argument is to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party in schools. Sun Ruijun, the director of teaching affairs of the 28th Middle School in Shenyang, advocated abolishing the Party's leadership in schools and establishing a school affairs committee in middle schools. He said, "Before 1953, the school did very well without a Party committee." In order to achieve the goal of usurping the leadership of the school, in addition to actively applying to join the China Democratic League, he also won over others to join the League, attempting to establish a branch or group of the China Democratic League in the school as a fortress for attacking the Party. The faculty and staff of the Fifth Middle School in Andong stripped off Zhao Wanjun's disguise, completely exposing his true face of attacking the Party. He once declared: "Without the leadership of the Communist Party, intellectuals can also govern the country." In addition to using the name of the Fifth Middle School's Minjin (China Association for Promoting Democracy) branch to instigate teachers to attack the Party, he also organized a small group to hold meetings on Zhenjiang Mountain, plotting so-called anti-Party activities such as a "Socialist Great Alliance."
    After the ugly faces of these rightists were exposed, they attempted to cover up and muddle through with sayings such as "cannon barrel," "grumbling," and "old liberal." However, after several ruthless rebuttals and fierce debates, some have admitted that they are thorough rightists and have pleaded guilty to the people.

　　Nankai University's Graduates Pursue Rightist Backbone Suo Sizheng
    The current graduating class of Nankai University is now concentrating its fire on pursuing Suo Sizheng (Mongolian), a key member of an important rightist group in the entire school and a graduate of the Department of Physics' electronics class. Before and after the blooming and contending period, he harbored hostility and attacked the Communist Party's ethnic policies, provoking ethnic sentiments. He wantonly attacked the Resist-America, Aid-Korea campaign, the Three-Anti and Five-Anti campaigns, ideological reform, and the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries campaign, as well as the achievements of socialist construction. He went to every department to run around, colluding with all the rightist groups and rightist backbone members in the school, planning, organizing, and directing activities to attack the Communist Party everywhere. He organized "Free Forums" and "Free Broadcasting" to incite the masses to "accuse the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries campaign" and incite students to oppose the Party Committee and the Communist Youth League Committee. He stirred up trouble everywhere, and almost all so-called "blooming and contending" gatherings had his footprints. He also viciously planned to pass the fire-starting "relay baton" first to Tianjin's universities and colleges, then to Jinan, Qingdao, and even the major coastal cities. Under the siege of the graduates, although Suo Sizheng is still resisting stubbornly, his rightist group has begun to disintegrate. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

### 总结斗争经验　深入追击右派

　　总结斗争经验　深入追击右派
    安徽各高等学校反右派斗争取得初步胜利
    右派分子们的反动言行已经被驳得体无完肤，他们的无耻阴谋和丑恶面貌也已经赤裸的暴露出来。各校反右派斗争告一段落，领导方面正在总结前一阶段的斗争经验，待下学期开学后，仍将继续深入的进行。
    安徽医学院的右派分子王寿昌，曾公开为章伯钧辩护，要取消
  “学校党委制”，他在解放前是开黑名单、镇压学生运动的同济大学三青团负责人。合肥矿业学院的龚家虎，农学院的沈文辅、赵伦彝，合肥师范专科学校的沈兴芷、刘林等右派分子都是有极端严重的资产阶级个人主义野心家，他们利用民主党派的组织，到处放火，煽动群众，恶毒地向党进攻，企图夺取学校的领导权。安徽师范学院揭露出来的右派分子的“军师”李敏，原来是隐藏在党内的叛徒；自命为“陆海空军大元帅”，向党猖狂进攻的陶华章，和进行反革命活动、写反动标语的费德林，原来都是混在共青团内的反动分子。
    根据各校揭露的材料，这些右派分子大多出生于剥削阶级家庭，他们的亲属许多是在社会革命运动中被斗争、被管制和被镇压的，而他们本人未得到彻底改造，反动的阶级立场并未转变，因而一有机会就疯狂地反党反社会主义。

    沈阳·安东各中学正总结斗争经验
    沈阳、安东两市的五十七个中等学校教职员，目前正在总结前一阶段的反右派斗争经验，以便展开进一步的斗争。
    从7月开始，两个市的三千八百多名中等学校教职员，认真学习了反右派斗争的有关文件，举行了报告会、座谈会和辩论会，无情地揭露和批判了隐藏在教育界中的右派分子。教职员们在斗争中得到了锻炼，同右派分子划清了界限。他们说：一个多月的斗争，胜过几年的政治课。
    各中等学校揭露出来的右派分子，虽然是形形色色，但他们一致的论点都是反对共产党领导学校。沈阳市第二十八中学的教导主任孙瑞君主张取消学校里党的领导，在中学成立校务委员会。他说“1953年以前，学校没有党委也办得很好”。他为了达到篡夺学校的领导权的目的，除自己积极要求参加民盟外，并拉拢其他人入盟，企图在学校成立民盟小组或支部，作为向党进攻的堡垒。安东市第五中学的教职员，揭去了赵万钧的外衣，彻底暴露出向党进攻的真面目。他曾宣扬：“没有共产党领导，知识分子也会治国。”他除了利用五中民进支部名义鼓动教员向党进攻外，还组织一个小集团，到镇江山上开会，密谋所谓“社会主义大同盟”等反党勾当。
    这些右派分子的丑恶面貌暴露以后，曾企图以“炮筒子”、“发牢骚”、“老自由主义者”等说法作为掩护，蒙混过关。但是，经过几次无情的驳斥和激烈的辩论以后，有的已经承认自己是个彻头彻尾的右派分子，并向人民请罪。

　　南开大学本届毕业生追击右派骨干索思正
    南开大学本届毕业生现在正集中火力追击全校重要的右派集团骨干分子、物理系电子班毕业生索思正（蒙古族）。他在鸣放前后就怀着敌意攻击共产党的民族政策，挑拨民族感情。他肆意攻击抗美援朝、三反五反、思想改造和肃反等运动以及社会主义建设的成就。他曾到每个系去奔走，串连全校所有右派集团和右派骨干分子，到处策划、组织和指挥向共产党进攻的活动。他组织了“自由论坛”、“自由广播”，煽动群众“控诉肃反运动”煽动学生反对党委会和团委会。他到处煽风点火，几乎所有所谓“鸣放”集会都有他的足迹；他并且恶毒地计划把点火“接力棒”首先传到天津各高等学校，再传到济南、青岛以至沿海各大城市。在毕业生们的围攻下，虽然索思正还在顽抗，但他的右派集团已经开始瓦解。（据新华社讯）
