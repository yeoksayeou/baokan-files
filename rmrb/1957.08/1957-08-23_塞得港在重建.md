    This district was razed to the ground during the tripartite aggression by Britain, France, and Israel. A total of two thousand four hundred and sixty houses have now been built in the district. The first batch of houses was allocated in June this year.
    The government has also reclaimed 16,000 feddans of wasteland south of Port Said. Families whose homes were destroyed in the war have priority in obtaining these lands.

　　塞得港在重建
    新华社开罗21日电　塞得港的埃勒曼纳什区有七百幢新住宅在昨天交给了新住户。在这个区里还有八百幢住宅预计将在下月初建成。
    这个区在英、法、以色列三国侵略时期曾经被夷为平地，区里现在总共建筑了二千四百六十套住宅。第一批住宅在今年6月间已经分配。
    政府还在塞得港南部开垦了一万六千费丹的荒地。战争中遭到破坏的家庭有获得这些土地的优先权。
