Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 20th: The No. 1 generating unit of Wuhan Thermal Power Plant, a newly built and most advanced power plant in our country, has been officially handed over for power generation today after trial operation. The commissioning of this unit doubles Wuhan's power capacity, which will greatly alleviate the power shortage faced by the rapidly developing industrial production and capital construction in the Wuhan area.

The current project being carried out at this large-scale thermal power plant is only the first phase. The plant buildings for the first phase have been completed. In addition to the No. 1 generating unit, three more large units will be installed, all of which will be installed and generating electricity by next year. In addition to supplying electricity, this thermal power plant will also supply a large amount of steam and hot water for production and daily life to factories and residents.

The Wuhan Thermal Power Plant is a high-pressure, high-temperature power plant built with Soviet assistance. The main equipment is also manufactured in the Soviet Union. The generating units are equipped with the latest electronic tube automatic control devices. Boiler water supply, steam temperature, and air supply are all remotely controlled and automatically adjusted. The various interlocking devices on the generating units ensure safe production. In the event of an accident during production, they can automatically switch to backup equipment or automatically shut down. Generators in China's power plants generally use air cooling, but the generators at this plant use the latest cooling method—hydrogen cooling, which is much more efficient than air cooling and can greatly increase power generation. Using this cooling method with the same power equipment can increase power generation capacity by one-fifth.

Construction of this thermal power plant began in November 1955. The quality of civil construction and machine installation is very good. Machine installation workers adopted the latest Soviet installation method—combined installation method—and completed the installation of the large boiler, which is eight stories high and weighs nearly a thousand tons, quickly and well. Therefore, they created the fastest record for boiler installation in the country.

### 又一座最新型的电厂  武汉热电厂一号机组移交发电

　　又一座最新型的电厂
　  武汉热电厂一号机组移交发电
    新华社武汉20日电　我国新建的一座最新型的电厂——武汉热电厂的一号机组在进行了试运转后，已在今天正式移交发电。这个机组投入发电使武汉电力增加了一倍，这将大大缓和武汉地区日益发展的工业生产和基本建设的供电不足的紧张状态。
  这座规模巨大的热电厂目前进行的工程，还只是第一期工程。现在第一期工程的厂房已经完工，除一号机组外，还要再安装三个巨大的机组，它们都将在明年全部安装好发电。这个热电厂除供电外，还将供应大量的蒸汽和热水给工厂和居民生产和生活之用。
    武汉热电厂是苏联帮助我国建设的一座高压高温电厂，主要设备也是苏联制造的。机组都有最新式电子管型的自动控制装置，锅炉给水、蒸气温度和供给空气等都是遥控自动调整；机组上的各种保证安全生产的连锁装置，在生产中一旦发生事故时，它们就能自行换上备用设备或自动停车。我国发电厂的发电机一般都是采用空气冷却，而这个厂的发电机却是采用最新的冷却方法——氢气冷却，这比空气冷却效率高的多，可以大大增加发电量。同样的发电设备采用这种方法冷却，可以增加发电能力五分之一。
    这座热电厂是1955年11月动工兴建的，土建和机器安装质量都很好。机器安装工人采用苏联最新安装方法——组合安装法，又好又快地完成了有八层楼高、近千吨重的大锅炉的安装工程，因此曾创造了全国安装锅炉的最快纪录。
