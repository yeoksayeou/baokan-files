    “上影画报”问世
    酝酿已久的“上影画报”终于问世了。创刊号已同上海读者见面。
    这是一种用十六开一百二十克道林纸精印的彩色画报，以图片为主，配有文字说明，介绍上海电影制片公司所属各厂摄制的影片，也适当介绍一些其他兄弟厂的影片。目的是希望观众从影片开拍起，就能对影片和电影工作者的劳动有所了解。
    这期画报连封面共二十页。内容有“毛主席在上海接见电影工作者”、“上影职工一致声讨右派分子”的照片；有获得本届国际青年节银质奖章并将参加亚洲电影周的“女篮五号”，正在上演的“罗汉钱”，已摄制成的“情长谊深”，以及正在拍摄中的“海魂”、“乘风破浪”、“椰林曲”、“护士日记”、“凤凰之歌”、“幸福的人们”等故事片的剧照、工作照；有著名演员白杨及病中周璇的生活照；此外，还有上影制片厂及兄弟厂正在摄制的一些美术片、记录片、科学技术片、故事片以及电影常识的照片、图片。
