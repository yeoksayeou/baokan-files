This is Zhang Jingyuan, a Chinese language teacher at Wuxi Second Girls' Middle School. Taking advantage of his Chinese language classes, he engaged in many activities that poisoned young people. The essay topics he assigned were all things like "My Bitterness," "My Opinions," and "What's on My Mind," attempting to create sentiments of dissatisfaction with the school and the Communist Party among the students. When students wrote in their essays praising the state's policies toward middle and primary school graduates and the achievements of the Three-Anti, Five-Anti, and Suppression of Counter-revolutionaries campaigns, Zhang Jingyuan crossed out all of this content. When some students expressed in their essays that "If I fail to get into school, I am willing to return to the countryside to be the first generation of educated farmers," Zhang Jingyuan only gave it a score of two.

Zhang Jingyuan also frequently sought out students for individual talks, telling them to solve problems themselves and not rely on the Communist Youth League organization. He also asked people to find out about the situation of League cadres in order to satirize and attack them.

    这是什么样的语文教师
    无锡市二女中的语文教师张景远。借着上语文课的机会，进行了很多毒害青年的活动。他出的作文题目，尽是些“我的苦闷”、“我的意见”、“我的心里话”等，想在学生中制造不满学校、不满共产党的情绪。学生在作文中写了赞扬国家对中、小学毕业生的政策和三反、五反、肃反成就的内容，张景远就把这些全部勾掉。有的学生在作文中表示“如果考不取学校，愿意回乡村去做第一代有文化的农民”，张景远只给了它二分。
    张景远还经常找学生个别谈话，要他们有问题自己解决，不必依靠共青团组织，他并叫人了解团干部的情况，加以讽刺打击。
