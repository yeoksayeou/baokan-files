Who Says Rightists Don't Rebel?
Jiang Lin

When we say that bourgeois rightists will rebel, some people don't quite believe it. They say, "Scholars who rebel don't succeed in three years." Most rightists are literary men and politicians. Their opposition to socialism and overthrow of the Communist Party is just arguing and scolding, fighting for personal power and status, and they won't resort to real swords and guns.

Will rightists really rebel? Look at the "Little Hungary Incident" on the streets of Hanyang County. Ma Zemin, a major figure of the Zhang-Luo alliance stationed in Wuhan, found a group of counter-revolutionaries like Yang Huanyao, and then instigated them to recruit troops and buy horses to prepare for rebellion. As soon as Zhang Bojun and his ilk blew the horn of attacking the Party in Beijing, this group of demons immediately rushed to the front. A small-scale "Hungarian incident" immediately erupted on the streets of Hanyang. Look, this group of demons incited a large number of deceived young students to frantically kidnap the head of the military service bureau, beat up cadres, destroy the post and telecommunications bureau, write slogans welcoming Chiang Kai-shek back, and even plot to attack power plants, seize military supplies, rob prisons, and kill Communist Party members... Isn't this considered rebellion? What's the difference between this and the counter-revolutionary riots in Hungary? Don't think that the rightists' mad words of "killing Communist Party members" are just talk; they have prepared weapons and are waiting for the opportunity. If it weren't for a teacher at Hanyang Middle School snatching the knife from the hands of a reactionary student, the Communist Party members at Hanyang Middle School would have been immediately killed! If the Party and the people had not resolutely counterattacked the rightists in time, who could guarantee that those well-dressed rightist leaders would not, like Yang Huanyao and Wang Jianguo, incite those who were temporarily deceived to take to the streets and launch a larger-scale Hanyang incident!

In fact, at Zhang Bojun's Six Professors Conference, Zeng Zhaolun shouted: "Don't think that scholars who rebel don't succeed in three years; Chinese intellectuals have a tradition of causing trouble!" The rightists themselves have shouted that they have the ability to rebel, and we still think that scholars cannot succeed in rebelling. Isn't this too pedantic? In fact, it is more than just too pedantic!

However, for the rightists, it is really worth seeing whether the people's world can be overthrown! Fei Xiaotong said that if there is trouble, three million troops will be needed to quell it. In fact, there is no need for three million troops; the workers' hammers and the farmers' carrying poles are the enemies of the rebels. If you don't believe it, look at the streets of Hanyang!

    谁说右派分子不会造反
    江林
    我们说资产阶级右派分子要造反，有些人却不大相信，他们说，秀才造反三年不成，右派分子多是文人政客，他们反对社会主义打倒共产党，也不过是吵吵骂骂，争点个人权力地位而已，动不了真刀真枪。
    右派分子是不是真要造反，请看汉阳县街头的“小匈牙利事件”。章罗联盟驻武汉的大员马哲民物色到杨焕尧这一批反革命分子，于是策动他们招兵买马准备造反。章伯钧之流在北京一吹起向党进攻的号角，这一伙魔鬼集团立刻就奋勇上阵了。一个小型“匈牙利事件”立即暴发在汉阳街头。看吧，这一个魔鬼集团煽动大批上了当的年青学生在那里疯狂地绑架兵役局长、毒打干部、捣毁邮电局，写标语欢迎蒋介石回来，还图谋打电厂、抢军火、劫监狱、杀害共产党员……这难道还不算造反吗？这和匈牙利的反革命暴乱究竟又有什么两样？不要以为右派分子“要杀共产党员”的狂语只是说说而已，他们是准备好了武器在等待时机。如果不是汉阳中学一位教师夺下了反动学生手中的刀子，汉阳中学的共产党员不立时就要惨遭毒手！如果不是党和人民及时地向右派分子进行坚决反击，谁能保那些衣冠楚楚的右派首脑不会像杨焕尧王建国一样，煽动那些一时被蒙蔽的人上街，发动起更大规模的汉阳事件！
    其实，就在章伯钧的六教授会议上，曾昭抡就已大叫：“不要看秀才造反三年不成，中国知识分子闹事是有传统的！”右派分子自己已经高喊有本事造反，我们还要以为秀才造反不成，这岂不迂？其实，这又何止太迂！
    不过，对右派分子来说，倒也真应该看看人民的天下到底能不能反得了！费孝通说，如果闹了起来，得用三百万军队来收。其实，何需三百万大军，工人的铁锤，农民的扁担，就是造反者的对头，不信，请看汉阳街头！
