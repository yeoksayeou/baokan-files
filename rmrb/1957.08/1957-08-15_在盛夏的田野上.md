    In the Summer Fields
    Heilongjiang Wheat Harvest
    Farmers Actively Preparing to Sell Grain
    (Our newspaper, Harbin, 9th) The rural areas of Heilongjiang Province are showing a scene of abundant harvest. Various agricultural cooperatives have universally begun the intense work of wheat harvesting and threshing. Many agricultural cooperatives have put forward the slogan: "Quickly hand in public grain, sell more surplus grain, and support socialist construction!" The Gongnong Township Agricultural Cooperative in Baiquan County harvested over 214,000 jin of wheat from more than 1,700 mu of wheat, with a 30% increase in yield compared to last year. After handing in public grain, reserving seeds, and reserving food grain, the whole cooperative has a surplus of 105,000 jin. The Party branch and the cooperative management committee decided to sell all the surplus grain to the state. Cooperative member Hou Jiang said: "The state loves us, we love the state. When the state is strong, we will be rich." The Fuyuan Agricultural Cooperative in Bayan County and others have organized vehicles and decided to complete the grain delivery task in one go, and sell 100,000 jin of surplus grain to the state at once.
    At present, there are also a small number of agricultural cooperative cadres and members who only plan to distribute more to themselves and hand in or sell less grain to the state. Therefore, it is very necessary to launch a socialist education campaign in these cooperatives.
    Except for individual areas in Heilongjiang Province where wheat production was reduced due to disasters, the output in most areas exceeded last year. The unit area yield per hectare is about 1,800 jin, and the total output reaches more than 800,000 tons.
    Anhui Harvests 20 Million Mu of Intermediate Rice
    40 Million Mu of Early, Mid, and Autumn Crops Growing Well
    (Our newspaper, Hefei, 10th) Anhui Province has begun harvesting its more than 20 million mu of intermediate rice. According to the output of more than 30,000 mu of intermediate rice already harvested in Huaining, Zongyang, Nanling, Xuancheng and other counties along the Yangtze River, the average yield is about 500 jin per mu. Although some areas suffered from flooding this year, most areas had moderate rainfall, and the crops grew well in both the hilly areas and polders. In addition, timely planting, sufficient fertilizer, and good technical management all contributed to generally large ears and full grains.
    Anhui has already achieved a bumper harvest of wheat and early rice this year, and intermediate rice will also have a bumper harvest. Autumn dryland crops are also growing well so far.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 10th) In non-disaster areas of Anhui Province, a bumper harvest is expected for more than 40 million mu of early, mid, and autumn crops.
    The more than 5.8 million mu of sorghum has thick stalks, large ears, and full grains, and can be harvested in just over ten days. The more than 4 million mu of spring and summer corn is growing even better. The 1.95 million mu of spring corn has already begun to be harvested. In addition, crops such as millet and red beans are also expected to have a bumper harvest.
    Tianjin Prefecture's Low-lying Areas Grow Good Rice
    (Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 12th) In many low-lying areas of Tianjin Prefecture, Hebei Province, where water conservancy projects have been built, rice has now grown to more than two feet high, and wild rice has grown to more than four feet high. Farmers are busy topdressing, raking seedlings, weeding, etc., striving for a bumper harvest.
    Expanding the planting of rice and wild rice is one of the main measures taken by Tianjin Prefecture in low-lying areas since last year to change planting and strive for agricultural harvest. In order to complete this work, since last winter, agricultural cooperatives along the Daqing River and the Nanyun River have built a large number of water conservancy projects. Under the difficult conditions of low river water levels and inability to irrigate by gravity, agricultural cooperatives in various places used all lifting tools to draw river water into the rice fields day and night. Some also mobilized a large number of strong laborers to temporarily build water-blocking dams to raise the river water level. In this way, the urgent need for water for reclaiming wasteland, washing alkali, and transplanting rice seedlings was finally solved. The entire prefecture planted more than 940,000 mu of rice and wild rice, exceeding the plan by more than 140,000 mu, an increase of more than 340,000 mu compared to last year.
    Jiangxi's 10 Million Mu of Single-Season Late Rice
    Stalks are Strong, Leaves are Large, Rarely Seen in Recent Years
    (Our newspaper) Jiangxi Province's 10 million mu of single-season late rice is growing with strong stalks and large leaves, which is rare in recent years. The good growth of single-season late rice this year is mainly due to timely rainfall, in addition to man-made conditions. It is estimated that the average yield of single-season late rice can reach 300 jin per mu, and the total output can reach 3 billion jin, an increase of 550 million jin compared to last year. At present, various places are stepping up topdressing and weeding to ensure a bumper harvest.

    在盛夏的田野上
    黑龙江小麦丰收
    农民积极准备交售粮食
    本报哈尔滨9日电　黑龙江省农村呈现一片丰收景象，各农业社普遍开始了紧张的小麦收割、打场工作。许多农业社都提出了“快快缴公粮，多多卖余粮，支援社会主义建设”的口号。拜泉县工农乡农业合作社一千七百多亩小麦，收获了二十一万四千多斤小麦，产量比去年提高30％。全社除交公粮、留种子、留口粮以外，尚余十万五千斤，党支部和社管理委员会决定，把全部余粮卖给国家。社员侯江说：“国家爱咱，咱爱国家，国家强了，咱就富了。”巴彦县富源等农业社已组织好车辆，决定一次完成缴粮任务，并把十万斤余粮一次卖给国家。
    目前也有少数农业社干部和社员，只打算自己多分、少交或少卖粮食给国家，因此在这些社迅速展开一次社会主义的教育十分必要。
    黑龙江省除个别地区小麦部分受灾减产，绝大部分地区产量超过去年。每公顷单位面积产量约一千八百多斤，总产量达八十万吨以上。
    安徽二千万亩中稻丰收
    四千万亩早中秋作物生长好
    本报合肥10日电　安徽省二千多万亩中稻，已开始收割。据沿江怀宁、枞阳、南陵、宣城等县已收的三万多亩中稻产量，平均每亩约在五百斤左右。今年虽有部分地区受涝，但绝大部分地区雨水调和，岗区、圩区生长得都好，加以种的适时，肥料充足，技术管理较好，所以一般都是穗大粒饱满。
    安徽今年小麦、早稻都已丰收，中稻也将丰收。秋季旱粮作物直到目前也生长良好。
    据新华社合肥10日电　安徽省非灾区四千多万亩早、中秋作物，丰收在望。
    五百八十多万亩高粱秆粗穗大子饱，再过十多天就可收割。四百多万亩春、夏玉米长得更好。一百九十五万亩春玉米并已开始收割。此外，谷子、红豆等作物也都可望丰收。
    天津专区洼地长好稻
    新华社保定12日电　河北省天津专区许多兴修了水利工程的洼地里，目前水稻已经长到两尺以上，淀稻也长到了四尺多高。农民们正在忙于追肥、捞秧、扒草等，争取丰收。
    扩大栽种水稻和淀稻，是天津专区从去年开始在洼地实行改种，争取农业丰收的主要措施之一。为了完成这一工作，去冬以来，沿大清河和南运河一带的农业社兴修了大量水利工程。在河水水位低、不能自流灌溉的困难条件下，各地农业社利用一切提水用具，日夜不停地把河水引进稻田。有的还动员大批强壮劳动力，临时垒挡水坝抬高河水水位，这样，终于解决了拉荒洗碱、插秧等急需用水的问题。全专区共栽种水稻和淀稻九十四万多亩，超过计划十四万多亩，比去年扩大了三十四万多亩。
    江西一千万亩一季晚稻
    秆壮叶大多年罕见
    本报讯　江西省一千万亩一季晚稻生长得秆壮叶大，为多年罕见。今年一季晚稻长得好，除人为的条件外，主要是雨水适时。估计一季晚稻每亩平均产量可达三百斤，总产量可达三十亿斤，比去年增产五亿五千万斤。目前各地正加紧追肥，耘田，以保证丰收。
