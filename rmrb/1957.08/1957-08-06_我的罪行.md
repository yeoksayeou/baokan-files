My Crimes

　　Qian Duansheng, President of Beijing College of Political Science and Law

　　Before liberation, I had a long history of anti-communist, anti-Soviet, supporting the Kuomintang reactionaries, and pro-American, worshiping-America criminal activities. After liberation, the Party and the people did not dwell on my past misdeeds, and gave me great trust and important work, originally hoping that I could continuously carry out ideological reform and serve the people wholeheartedly. However, I stood on the position of the bourgeois reactionary faction, harboring dissatisfaction, disloyal to the Party, and disloyal to the people. In the early days of liberation, I met with American secret service reporters stationed in Beijing many times, and in 1949 and 1950 I also corresponded with American secret service professor Fairbank and others. Recently, taking advantage of the Party's rectification campaign, I attacked the Party, attempting to weaken and get rid of the Party's leadership in the College of Political Science and Law, to lead the College of Political Science and Law away from the socialist road and back to the capitalist road, and to slander the work led by the Party in the political and legal departments and higher education departments, attempting to weaken the Party's leadership over political and legal work and education work. I am a sinner, and my crimes are extremely harmful to the country and the people. I hereby bow my head and confess my guilt to the Municipal People's Congress, the people of the city, and the people of the whole country.

　　Accepting the Leadership of the Zhang-Luo Alliance and Embarking on the Anti-Party, Anti-Socialist Road

　　The Zhang-Luo Alliance is a criminal group of right-wing elements. Zhang Bojun was a street politician whom I despised, but since I joined the alliance, Zhang flattered me as a great intellectual, an important figure in higher education, and said that I should be promoted three levels within the alliance. Although he had not discussed with me his conspiracy to undermine our country's basic system, the so-called "Political Design Institute," I had no political disputes with Zhang Bojun. On March 12th, when Zhang said that the League should discuss more national affairs in the future, I also expressed my admiration. When he talked about our CPPCC playing the role of an upper house, I also thought he was insightful.

　　Luo Longji and I received the same bourgeois education, and had frequent interactions in Kunming.

　　In April 1955, when he asked me to jointly invite university professors of science, engineering, liberal arts, and law (I used to say professors of political science and law who had not taught, because it was a temporary response to questioning, and there was an error in my memory) to a forum in the Cultural Club to discuss issues such as learning from the Soviet Union, teaching and research conditions, work arrangements, and the relationship between new and old personnel, I readily agreed.

　　Since Zhang and Luo seized on the issue of intellectuals, because I myself had sinful thoughts, I mistakenly thought that Zhang and Luo's leadership (which in reality was a conspiracy against the Party and the socialist road) was correct. I accepted Zhang and Luo's leadership within the alliance. This led me deeper and deeper into the anti-Party and anti-socialist road, and also increasingly into the road of the Zhang-Luo Alliance. Due to the ideological resonance between me and the Zhang-Luo Alliance, there was objectively a coordination of actions.

　　Started Criminal Activities at the College of Political Science and Law, Undermining the Party's Leadership in Many Ways

　　Because I had serious dissatisfaction and opposition to the Party in the College of Political Science and Law, I carried out anti-Party criminal activities in the College of Political Science and Law and in the political and legal field.

　　The Zhang-Luo Alliance proclaimed themselves as leaders of great intellectuals, they harbored evil intentions, and first attempted to drive the Party out of the universities. Because I myself also had anti-Party criminal thoughts, after hearing their false transmissions, I believed them to be true, and thought that there was an opportunity to take advantage of. As soon as the rectification began, I openly proposed that the school could do without the leadership of the Party committee. An institution like the school affairs committee, headed by me, should lead.

　　In order to finally achieve the dirty goals of weakening the Party's leadership in the College of Political Science and Law and enhancing my own position and satisfying my own ambitions, I carried out a series of criminal activities. I attempted to undermine the strong unity of the Party organization in the College of Political Science and Law, saying that there was "too much sectarianism within the Party, with Party members from three sources, and those from Revolutionary University are in a leading position, now we should rectify the bad practices of Revolutionary University." I attempted to realize the conspiracy of causing disunity within the Party and weakening the Party.

　　Reporting systems, archives, and evaluations are all Party personnel systems. I slandered these systems, saying that some of the reports are untrue, therefore the student's files and evaluations have become a problem.

　　In order to weaken the Party's leadership, I also looked for objects of dissatisfaction with the Party, and carried out instigation, alienation, and incitement. I took a fancy to old professors and old judicial personnel, maliciously saying that they were discriminated against. I also carried out the same instigation against young teachers, saying that they were not valued. More prominently, I took advantage of the dissatisfaction of Du Ruji, a lecturer at the College of Political Science and Law, with the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, suggesting that he "speak out freely" and make a big fuss in the rectification campaign.

　　Among the graduates of our college, some were dissatisfied with the job assignments. In response to this situation, I fabricated facts, saying that except for one person, none of the graduates assigned to Tianjin in 1954 were assigned to political and legal departments, while the actual situation was that the vast majority were working in political and legal departments, and I knew this fact.

　　In the early stages of the rectification campaign, the most prominent of my destructive activities among students was that I encouraged a student named Zhang Wenyue, who had always been dissatisfied with the Party, to attack the Party. Zhang wrote me a letter full of reactionary content. I supported his arrogant attacks on the class leaders and even the Party organization. I also unscrupulously gave him a reply letter, asking him to adhere to his reactionary position and attack the Party.

　　To undermine the Party's prestige, so as to achieve the conspiracy of weakening and getting rid of the Party's leadership, it is impossible to do it alone. So I looked for assistants. In addition to inciting and co-opting individuals to carry out anti-Party activities, I also attempted to use the school's Democratic League and trade union organizations as my assistants. I emphasized that the League and the trade union should supervise the Party, in fact, it was to ask League members and trade union members to look for shortcomings in their work as a basis for attacking the Party. I also demanded the development of League members, attempting to make the League strong enough to confront the Party. In addition, I have long and clearly had such an idea of opposing the Party, I attempted to understand the work of relevant units through League members. This idea has existed since 1952, which also fully shows that my anti-Party thought has also existed for a long time.

　　To finally turn the College of Political Science and Law into my independent kingdom, it is not just for the sake of seizing power alone, but also with the intention of pulling the College of Political Science and Law back to the capitalist road. In 1952, the departments were adjusted, and the Beijing College of Political Science and Law was established, followed by new training goals and new education policies. In the past few years, under the leadership of the Party, the young College of Political Science and Law has achieved great achievements. However, due to my deeply rooted bourgeois ideas of running a school, which often haunt me, I only accepted the form of departmental adjustment and teaching reform, but refused to accept its spiritual essence. I have always been incompatible with and disapproved of the early two-year system and the necessary and correct ideological remolding education conducted on young students at that time. I am still obsessed with longer-term and so-called "regular" education, which is actually the old bourgeois education.

　　I have not discussed the various plans for the Great Law School, nor have I heard anyone talk about it before returning to China. But I did try to bring some people who had taught politics and law to the College of Political Science and Law to take up teaching work. For example, Lou Bangyan, I also talked to him several times; Zhang Qitai from Fudan University, although I have not talked to him, I also hope that he can come; Chen Yufeng, who is still in Germany, I also hope that he can come. These people are all my former students. I hope that these people will ask to return to China and ask to come to the college themselves, so as to cover up my intention of recruiting people. Because I know that recruiting people blatantly will reveal my true intentions. The more people who are willing to serve my school that does not take the socialist road come, the more inevitable the restoration of a capitalist school will become the only possibility.

　　I slandered the political and legal departments for having serious sectarianism, and slandered the higher education departments for having serious dogmatism, not for anything else, but to make it easier for the graduates of the school in my mind to have jobs. So, under the guise of criticizing sectarianism, I slandered the "monolithic" nature of the political and legal departments, and attempted to make the political and legal departments no longer emphasize political conditions for cadres. In this way, students who graduated from the College of Political Science and Law restored to the capitalist road can naturally have jobs. After the political and legal departments are filled with people who have received bourgeois education, they will inevitably move towards the reactionary road of bourgeois democratic rule of law.

　　I am a political careerist disguised as a "scholar." For a long time, I have been trying to use the good name of "professor" to satisfy my political desires and to use the school as a territory to increase my political capital. The ambitions of political careerists are always inching forward and are always endless. Although I was not consciously aware of such great political ambitions when I was speaking out freely and releasing poisons in the early stages of the rectification campaign, political ambitions are rising tides, and ambitions have their objective laws of development. I have the ambition to usurp the leadership of the College of Political Science and Law, and further develop to have the ambition to usurp the leadership of the political and legal departments, which is also an objective law of development. Today, I realize that the harm of my criminal activities is much more serious than when I committed the criminal activities. I am truly a sinner against the Party and the people.

　　Formed a "Close Friendship" with American Secret Agents and Maintained Close Contact Even After Liberation

　　I also had a long-term relationship with American secret agent Fairbank, who was disguised as a "professor." Since 1937, I would visit him whenever I went to the United States. From the winter of 1947 to the winter of 1948, I went to Harvard University, which is now seen as an enemy country. At that time, I lived in his home. This was not enough. After liberation, in 1949 and 1950, in order to promote the publication of a book I wrote in English about the old Chinese government, and to ask him to buy some books and collect a portion of the income tax that should be refunded, I sent twenty letters, and he sent eighteen letters. The letters also mentioned many things that a patriotic Chinese would never say. A letter dated March 9, 1949, contained the following paragraph: "As a Chinese who demands to be in line with the times, I sincerely admire the creators of the new order, although I myself may suffer some inconveniences and misunderstandings, and will suffer in the future." A letter dated September 6 contained the following paragraph: "My Chinese friends in Berkeley (where the University of California is located) and London told me that they knew some widely circulated letters about me, and I think this must refer to my letters to you. Please keep this letter to yourself (that is, do not circulate it), because sometimes complicated things can happen." He also admitted this in a letter dated October 4. A letter dated June 30, 1950, introduced the improvement of the national economy. Writing these letters not only blurred the distinction between the enemy and ourselves and lost the national position, but also allowed the enemy to obtain information from them, thereby rendering and distorting them to achieve the attempt to slander our Party and our people. The motherland has been liberated, but I still maintain an extremely stubborn comprador mentality, and continue to maintain it even after studying the criticism of the White Paper. Not only is the book, which is not worth a penny but is harmful to the people, insisted on being published, but the unjust wealth is still to be recovered. I committed extremely serious crimes, and it is even more serious that I have not confessed them.

　　Fairbank, disguised as an "expert in modern Chinese history," has long served the US State Department. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he traveled between China and the United States, consciously cultivating a group of so-called "democratic individualists" in the White Paper among senior intellectuals for American imperialism, and I was one of the most prominent. I studied in the United States in my early years. From 1937 to 1948, I went there four times in eleven years. One time was with Hu Shi, and the purpose was to ask American imperialism to cheer for Chiang Kai-shek's reactionaries. The second and third times were to attend the reactionary Pacific Society of America. The fourth time was to sell myself to teach. During this period, I became Fairbank's close friend. He also introduced me to many American officials and reporters in China. Among the officials, I interacted frequently with Stone, who had been a consul in Kunming. Due to the introduction of Fairbank and Stone, I got to know a dozen American journalists in the United States or China, and these journalists were often members of the US Information Service and the Strategic Intelligence Bureau during the war. Many of the so-called "professors" in the United States were also engaged in intelligence work during the war. I remember that the head of the Kunming USIS was originally a reporter named Burke.

　　I returned to Beijing in early December 1948. Before and after liberation, the American journalists in Beijing who had contact with me were: Lai Wenhuode's wife, Still, Barnett, Burke, Lyons (female), etc. Lai Wenhuode and his wife were introduced to me by Fairbank when I was in the United States from 1947 to 1948. Lai worked for the Crane Jane Foundation, which issued a periodical newsletter on international affairs, and it was also a secret service agency, of course. His wife went to Shanghai the day after I returned to Beijing. Still is a so-called veteran "famous reporter," first met at Jiang Menglin's home in Kunming, and then met several times, and left Beijing before liberation. Barnett was also a visitor from the above-mentioned Crane Jane Foundation, and was introduced by Lai Wenhuode's wife after returning to Beijing. Burke was the first person in charge of the Kunming USIS mentioned above, and I met him in New York at the wife of my lover's brother Chen Gongyu (British, American nationality), and he was still a reporter in Beijing in 1948. Lyons was also a friend of Chen Gongyu's wife.

　　When Beijing was first liberated in February 1949, Barnett and Lyons visited me. After they went out, nearby comrades from the People's Liberation Army came in for necessary inquiries. Thanks to the care of the Party and the People's Government, this matter ended. But I still did not know how to repent and reform. Because they kept calling me and asking to visit me, I went to see some of them on February 27. At this time, the People's Government ordered the cessation of foreign journalists' activities, and they finally disappeared. But when Lyons left Beijing and returned to the United States in April and May, and the American professor Wender from Tsinghua University gave her a farewell dinner, I was invited to accompany her, and I still went. If this is sentimentalism, it is already comprador sentimentalism, not ordinary people's sentimentalism.

　　What these secret service reporters talked to me about, during the siege, was the question of whether peaceful liberation or military liberation was more likely, and they also asked about the school's situation, who had escaped, etc. After entering the city, the main thing was that they hoped that I could find a way to introduce them to meet the person in charge. I refused. They also asked about the school's situation, whether classes had started, whether it had been taken over, etc.

　　At that time, the American imperialist consul Ke Lebo, immediately after our army entered the city, wanted to find me again and again. I didn't want him to come to my house, I went there once, and he also made a request to introduce him to the responsible comrade. I said that the responsible comrade was too busy and would never meet, and I was not familiar with him, so I asked him not to bother me anymore. Since then, I have never met him again. He sent a letter in early March conveying that Columbia University wanted me to go, and asked me to send him a copy of the reply telegram. I directly replied to the telegram, refusing to go, and did not send the copy of the reply telegram to Ke Lebo. Later, on July 4th, the American National Day, he sent an invitation card, and I called in the morning to wish him the National Day, but declined to attend in the afternoon because I had something to do.

　　In addition, after the liberation of Beijing, I had three or four contacts with the American Du Lewen. Du was introduced to me in Kunming by the American teacher Wender, who is now at Peking University. At that time, he was the representative of the American Red Cross in China. He gave us a lot of help in medicine in Kunming, and we had closer contacts. He arrived in Beijing before me. Before liberation, he served as the American representative in China for relief work. Later, he did business exporting wooden furniture. His younger brother Du Lewu lived with him in adjacent houses, and had done intelligence work for the US military during the war. After the victory, his profession was a wooden furniture exporter, and he often held tea parties, etc., which doctors from Xiehe Hospital also attended from time to time. During the siege or a few days after liberation, the whole family left Beijing.

　　Before liberation, I could not realize that these demons and monsters were carrying out secret service activities in China. The Party did not hold me accountable for the past and gave me a lenient treatment.

　　Not only did I have long-term criminal activities before liberation, but also after studying faithfully and honestly in 1952, I did not thoroughly confess my crimes, which further increased the seriousness of my crimes. Now I bow my head and confess my guilt to the people again. I am willing to accept all the punishments and penalties I deserve. I am determined to settle my accounts, both new and old, to thoroughly confess all criminal activities, and also to thoroughly confess all wrong words and deeds, especially criminal activities related to American imperialism. I must clearly confess everything I remember in the next few days.

    我的罪行
  　北京政法学院院长　钱端升
    解放以前，我有过长期的反共反苏、拥护国民党反动派、亲美崇美的罪恶活动。解放后，党和人民不念旧恶，给我以很大的信任和很重要的工作，原希望我能够不断地进行思想改造，全心全意地为人民服务。但是我站在资产阶级反动派的立场上，心怀不满、不忠于党、不忠于人民。解放初期还和留京的美国特务记者见面多次，1949年和1950年还和美国特务教授费正清等通信。最近更趁党整风的机会，向党进攻，妄图在政法学院削弱、摆脱党的领导，使政法学院离开社会主义的道路，拉回到资本主义道路上去，并且诋毁政法部门和高教部门的党所领导的工作，企图从而削弱党对政法工作和教育工作的领导。我是罪人，我的罪行对于国家、对于人民具有极其严重的危害性。我谨向市人民代表大会、全市人民和全国人民低头认罪。
    接受章罗联盟领导走上反党反社会主义道路
    章罗联盟是一个右派分子的罪恶集团。章伯钧是我所瞧不起的马路政客，但从我入盟以后，章恭维我是大知识分子，是高教界的重要人物，并说我在盟内应该连升三级。尽管他没有同我谈过他企图破坏我们国家基本制度的所谓“政治设计院”这一阴谋，可是我和章伯钧在政治上没有发生过争论。3月12日当章说盟今后应多讨论国家大事时，我还表示过赞佩。他谈到我们政协起上院的作用时，我还以为他很有见地。
    罗隆基和我受过相同的资产阶级的教育，在昆明时早就有过频繁的往来。
    1955年4月他要我联名在文化俱乐部请理工文法的大学教授（从前我说是政法方面未上课的教授，因为是临时答复质问，记忆上有了错误）座谈学习苏联、教研条件、工作安排、新老关系等问题时，我也欣然同意。
    自章、罗抓知识分子问题以来，由于我自己有罪恶思想，妄以为章罗的领导（这领导实际上是阴谋反党、反社会主义道路）是正确的。我接受了章罗在盟内的领导。这样使我愈陷愈深地走入反党反社会主义的道路，也越来越走入章罗联盟的道路。由于我和章罗联盟思想上的共鸣，客观上就产生了行动上的配合。
    在政法学院开始了罪恶活动，多方面破坏党的领导
    我由于对政法学院的党有严重的不满和对立，我就在政法学院和政法方面进行了反党的罪恶活动。
    章罗联盟自封为大知识分子的领导者，他们包藏祸心，首先企图在高等学校中赶走党。由于我自己也有反党的罪恶思想，所以听到了他们的假传达后，便信以为真，便以为有机可乘。整风一开始，我就公然提出学校可以不要党委来领导。由以我为首的校务委员会一类机构来领导。
    为了最后达到削弱政法学院党的领导和提高我自己的地位，满足我自己的野心的肮脏目的，我进行了一系列的罪恶活动。我企图破坏政法学院党组织坚强的团结，说党内“宗派主义太多，有三方面来的党员，处于领导地位的是革大来的，现在应该整革大遗风。”妄图实现使党内部闹不团结和削弱党的阴谋。
    汇报制度、档案、鉴定都是党的人事制度。我诬蔑这些制度，说汇报有一部分是不真实的，因此关于学生的档案和鉴定也成了问题。
    为了削弱党的领导，我又寻找对党不满的对象，进行挑拨、离间和煽动。我看中老教授和老的司法人员，恶毒地说他们受到歧视。我对青年教师也同样进行挑拨，说他们不受重视。更突出的是，我利用政法学院讲师杜汝辑对肃反的不满情绪，示意他在整风中“大鸣大放”大闹特闹。
    在我院的毕业生中，有些人对工作分配是有不满的情绪的。针对这一情况，我捏造事实，说1954年分配到天津的毕业生除一人外，都没有分配到政法部门，而实际情况是绝大多数是在政法部门工作，而且我是知道这个事实的。
    在整风初期，我在学生中进行的破坏活动，最突出的是我鼓动一个一贯对党不满的学生章文岳向党进攻。章写给我一封充满了反动内容的信。我支持了他对班领导以至于党组织的狂妄攻击。我还肆无忌惮地给了他一封回信，要他坚持反动的立场，向党进攻。
    要破坏党的威信，从而达到削弱、摆脱党的领导的阴谋，单枪匹马是不行的。我于是寻找助手。除了煽动、拉拢个别的人进行反党活动外，我还企图利用学校民盟和工会组织来作我的助手。我强调盟和工会要对党进行监督，实际上就是要盟员和工会会员寻找工作上的缺点来作为攻击党的根据。我还要求发展盟员，企图使盟有力量来和党分庭抗礼。此外，我还长期地、明确地有着这样一个和党闹对立的思想，我企图通过盟员来了解各有关单位的工作情况。这个思想自1952年起就存在着，也充分说明在这一点上我的反党思想也是长期存在的。
    要最后把政法学院变成我的独立王国，也不仅仅为了大权独揽，而是有把政法学院拉回到资本主义道路上的企图的。1952年，院系调整，北京政法学院建立起来了，随后就有了新的培养目标和新的教育方针。这几年来，年幼的政法学院，在党的领导下，取得了巨大的成就。但是由于我的资产阶级办学的思想根深蒂固，经常作祟，我也只接受了院系调整和教学改革的形式，而拒绝接受其精神实质。我对于早期的二年制和对于当时对青年学生所进行的必要的和正确的思想改造的教育，总是格格不入，不以为然。我仍然迷恋于较长期的和所谓“正轨”的教育，而实则就是旧的资产阶级的教育。
    关于大法学院的各种方案，我没有谈过，在回国以前也没有听人谈过。但我的确是企图拉些原来教过政法的人到政法学院来担任教学工作的。如楼邦彦，也同他谈过几次；复旦大学的张企泰，我虽没有同他谈过，心中也希望他能来；尚在德国的陈育凤，我也希望他来。这几个人都是我从前的学生。这些人我都希望他们自己会要求回国，要求来院，这样就可以掩盖我的拉人的意图。因为我知道明目张胆地拉人是会露马脚的。这种愿意为我的不走社会主义道路的学校服务的人来得多了，资本主义的学校的复辟也必然成为唯一可能的结果。
    我诬蔑政法部门有严重的宗派主义，诬蔑高教部门有严重的教条主义，也不是为了别的，而是为了使我心目中的学校的毕业生能够很容易有工作。我于是在批评宗派主义的幌子下，诬蔑政法部门的“清一色”，妄图使政法部门对干部不再强调政治条件。这样，复辟到资本主义道路上的政法学院毕业的学生，也自然可以有工作了。政法部门充满了受过资产阶级教育的人们之后，也必然会走向资产阶级民主的法制的反动道路。
    我是一个披着“学者”外衣的政治野心家，长期以来，企图利用“教授”的好名称，来满足我的政治欲望，企图把学校作为地盘而增加我的政治资本。政治野心家的野心总是得寸进尺，总是没有止境的。尽管我在整风初期乱鸣乱放，大放毒素时，我还不自觉地意识到这样大的政治野心，但政治野心是水涨船高的，野心有它客观的发展规律。我有篡夺政法学院领导权的野心，更从而发展到具有篡夺政法部门的领导权的野心，也是客观的发展规律。我的罪恶活动的危害性，今天我认识到了，要远比我在作出罪恶活动时严重得多。我真是党和人民的罪人。
    同美国特务结成“亲密朋友”，在解放以后仍有密切联系
    我还和披着“教授外衣”的美国特务费正清有过长期的关系。自1937年起，我到美国必去访问他。在1947年冬到1948年冬，我到了现在看来是敌国的哈佛大学。当时我就住在他家中。这还不够，解放后，在1949年和1950年，为了促成我用英文写的一本关于旧中国政府的书的出版，并为了要他代购一些书籍和代领应退的一部分所得税，我去过二十封信，他来过十八封信。信中还讲到许多一个爱国的中国人所决不会讲的话。1949年3月9日去信有这样一段：“作为一个要求合乎时代的中国人，我诚意地钦佩新秩序的缔造者，尽管我本人可以遭受一些不方便和不谅解，而且在今后还会遭受”。9月6日去信有这样一段：“我的在贝克莱（加州大学所在地）和伦敦的中国朋友告诉我说，他们知道一些关于我的广为流传的信，我想这一定是指我给你的信。请将此信留给你自己（就是不要流传之意），因为，有时可以有复杂的事情发生。”这件事他于10月4日来信也承认了。在1950年6月30日的去信中介绍了国家经济好转情况。写这些信，不但是敌我不分，丧失了民族的立场，而且使敌人可从中取得情报，从而加以渲染曲解，以达到诬蔑我们党、我们人民的企图。祖国是已经解放了，但我仍然保持着极端顽固的买办思想，而且在批判白皮书的学习之后还继续保持下去。不但不值一文钱，而且对人民有害的书偏要出版，不义之财仍然要取回。我犯了极其严重的罪行，而且一直没有交代，更是罪加一等。
    费正清披着“中国近代史专家”的外衣，长期为美国国务院服务，抗战期内更往来于中美两国之间，在高级知识分子中间有意识地为美国帝国主义培养一批白皮书中所谓的“民主个人主义者”，而我就是其中最突出的一个。我早年留学于美国，自1937到1948年，十一年中去过四次，一次是跟胡适去的，目的是要求美国帝国主义为蒋介石反动派打气。第二、第三次是去出席美国反动的太平洋学会。第四次是卖身投靠式的教书。在此期中我成了费正清的亲密朋友。他又把美国在华的不少官员和记者介绍给我。在官员中，在昆明做过领事的石博思和我往来频繁。由于费正清和石博思的介绍，我认识了十来个在美国或在中国的美国记者，而这些记者在大战期中又往往是美新处和战略情报局的人员。美国的所谓“教授”在大战期中也有不少人搞情报工作的。我记得昆明美新处的负责人最早就是一个叫做柏克的记者。
    我是1948年12月初回到北京的。解放前后，在京美国记者同我有过接触的有：赖文霍德之妻，斯蒂耳，巴乃德，柏克，赖盎斯（女）等人。赖文霍德夫妇是我1947年到1948年在美国时由于费正清的介绍而认识的。赖服务于克简基金会，这个基金会印发一种有关国际事务的定期通讯，也当然是一个特务机关。其妻在我回京的次日即去了上海。斯蒂耳是所谓老牌“名记者”，首次在昆明蒋梦麟家见面，以后陆续见过几次，解放前即已离京。巴乃德也是上述克简基金会的访员，是回京后由赖文霍德之妻介绍而认识的。柏克即上述昆明美新处的最先负责人，是我在纽约时在我爱人的哥哥陈公与的妻子（英人，美籍）处认得的，1948年在京时仍为记者。赖盎斯也是陈公与的妻子的朋友。
    当1949年2月，北京初解放后，巴乃德和赖盎斯来访过我，出门后，附近解放军同志即进来作必要的查询。由于党和人民政府的照顾，此事即结束了。但我尚不知改过自新。因他们不断来电话要求访我，我在2月27日还去见了他们中的一些人。此时，人民政府下令停止外国记者活动，他们也终于消了声匿了迹。但当赖盎斯在4、5月离京返美，清华美籍教授温德为她饯行时，邀我作陪，我仍然去了。这要是温情主义的话，也已经是买办的温情主义，而不是一般人的温情主义了。
    这些特务记者同我谈的，在围城期中，是关于和平解放或是武力解放那个可能性较大的问题，也问及学校情况，哪个人逃了等。进城后，主要是他们希望我能设法介绍他们给负责人见面。我拒绝了。他们也问及学校情况以及已否上课，已否接管等。
    当时，美国帝国主义的领事柯乐博，在我军一进城后，即连二接三地要找我。我不愿意他来我家，我去过一次，他也提出了要我介绍见负责同志的请求。我说负责同志太忙，决不会见，而且我也不熟悉，要他不要再麻烦我。自此以后，我从未和他再见过面。他3月初送来过一封信转达哥伦比亚大学要我去，并要我将复电副本送他。我直接电复，拒绝前往，也没有把复电副本送给柯乐博。以后，7月4日美国国庆，他有请柬来，我早晨打去电话祝了国庆，但推有事下午没有去参加。
    此外在北京解放后，我和美国人杜乐文还有过三、四次往来。杜是在昆明时由现在在北大的美籍教师温德的介绍而认识的。他当时是美国红十字会的驻华代表。他在昆时，在医药上曾给我们不少帮助，过从较密。他比我先到北京。解放前他做过有关救济工作的美国驻华代表。以后他做木器家具出口的买卖。他的弟弟杜乐武和他住在相邻的房子中，在战时曾做过美军的情报工作。胜利后，他的职业是木器家具出口商，经常请茶会等等，协和的医生们也时有参加的，围城期中或解放几天后，即举家离京。
    在解放之前，我是认识不到这些妖魔鬼怪是在中国进行特务活动的。党对我不咎既往，给了我宽大的对待。
    我不但在解放以前有着长期的罪恶活动，而且1952年经过忠诚老实学习，我又不彻底交代我的罪行，这更增加我的罪行的严重性。我现在谨再向人民低头认罪。我甘愿受一切应得的处分和惩罚。我痛下决心，我一定要算清自己的帐，新的要算清，旧的也要算清，要彻底交代一切罪恶的活动，也要彻底交代一切错误的言行，特别是关于和美国帝国主义有关的罪恶活动。我记得的我一定要在几天之内逐件交代清楚。
