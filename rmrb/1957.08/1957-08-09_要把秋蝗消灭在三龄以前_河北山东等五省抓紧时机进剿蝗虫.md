    To Eliminate Autumn Locusts Before the Third Instar
    Hebei, Shandong, and Other Five Provinces Seize the Opportunity to Suppress Locusts
    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces are actively carrying out locust extermination work.

    According to incomplete statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture yesterday, the locust occurrence area in the above five provinces has expanded to more than 4.33 million mu, which is more than the same period last year. Among them, Shandong Province and Hebei Province are more serious, with locust occurrence areas of more than one to two million mu each. The number of locust nymphs ranges from 30 to 80 per square zhang, and can reach 500 to 1,000 in dense areas. In Jiangsu, Anhui, and Henan provinces, because most locust areas have been flooded, the locust occurrence area is smaller than last year. However, according to an inspection in Anhui Province, the mortality rate of locust eggs after being submerged by floods is only 20% to 30%, and the remaining 70% to 80% of the locust eggs still have the potential to hatch.

    The locust nymphs in these areas are generally in the second to third instar now, with only a few in the first, fourth, and fifth instars. In order to seize the opportunity to eliminate locust nymphs before the third instar, mass locust extermination work has been widely launched in various places. In Baoding, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Xingtai, and Handan five special districts of Hebei Province, over a thousand cadres have gone deep into the countryside to mobilize the masses to carry out locust extermination work. Now, locusts have been mostly eliminated in Qiu County, Nangong, and other eleven counties in Handan and Xingtai special districts. In the locust extermination work in Pingyuan County, Shandong Province, the establishment of locust extermination groups and locust extermination brigades, and the implementation of rotational prevention and control methods, have resulted in rapid progress and great achievements in locust extermination work, completing the prevention and control tasks within four days.

    Today, the Ministry of Agriculture sent telegrams to the provinces where locust pupae have occurred, requiring agricultural departments at all levels to earnestly strengthen their leadership over locust extermination work and quickly eliminate locusts.

### 要把秋蝗消灭在三龄以前  河北山东等五省抓紧时机进剿蝗虫

    要把秋蝗消灭在三龄以前
    河北山东等五省抓紧时机进剿蝗虫
    新华社讯　河北、山东、河南、安徽和江苏等省正积极开展灭蝗工作。
    据农业部昨天的不完全统计，以上五省蝗虫的发生面积已经发展到四百三十三万多亩，比去年同期为多。其中比较严重的是山东省和河北省，蝗虫的发生面积都在一、二百万亩以上。蝗蝻每方丈有三十头到八十头，稠的达五百到一千头。江苏、安徽、河南三省由于大部蝗区已被洪水淹没，所以蝗区发生面积比去年少。但据安徽省检查，遭洪水浸淹过的蝗卵死亡率只有20％到30％，其余70％到80％的蝗卵仍然有出土的可能。
    这些地区的蝗蝻现在一般都在二龄到三龄，只有少数在一龄、四龄、五龄。为了抓紧时机，将蝗蝻消灭在三龄以前，各地群众性的灭蝗工作已经广泛展开。河北省保定、天津、石家庄、邢台、邯郸五个专区二十五个县，有一千多个干部已经深入农村，发动群众进行灭蝗工作。现在邯郸、邢台专区的丘县、南宫等十一个县的蝗虫已经大部消灭。山东省平原县蝗区在灭蝗工作中由于组织了灭蝗小组和灭蝗大队，施行了轮换防治的办法，因此灭蝗工作进展迅速，成绩很大，四天之内就完成了防治任务。
    今天，农业部给发生蛹虫的省份打了电报，要求各级农业部门切实加强对灭蝗工作的领导，迅速扑灭蝗虫。
