The Zhang-Luo Alliance, in order to realize its anti-Party conspiracy, adopted various despicable means to vigorously recruit and expand its strength in order to achieve its goal of usurping the Party's leadership. These situations have been reflected in some reports exposing the Zhang-Luo conspiracy in the past. From these reports from several places, it can be seen how the Zhang-Luo Alliance's claws distributed in various places recruited and developed organizations to carry out despicable activities.

    Fuxin City Democratic League Organization
    Established in Three Months, Became an Anti-Party Command Center

    Chai Shou'an, director of the preparatory office of the Fuxin City Democratic League, opened the door to backward elements, started from scratch in three months, and formed the preparatory committee of the Fuxin City Democratic League. This hastily built Democratic League organization immediately formed a right-wing group and launched a frenzied attack on the Party.

    Before February and March of this year, the Democratic League in Fuxin only had one member, Chai Shou'an, a teacher at the Miners' Bureau Amateur Middle School. By the beginning of June, the preparatory committee of the Democratic League Municipal Committee was established here, and the number of members had grown to thirty-seven.

    It has been revealed that Chai Shou'an intentionally targeted some people who were dissatisfied with the Party and those who had been struggled against in political movements as development targets, and was even extremely interested in historical counter-revolutionaries. She told these people that joining the League provided support, guaranteed human rights, and no matter what mistakes were made, the organization could help you speak up. Only by joining the League could you get warmth. Fang Zhuxin, a Kuomintang special party member and assistant engineer of the Fuxin Mining Bureau who suppressed workers' strikes, and other elements with serious historical problems and dissatisfaction with the Party, were all brought into the League.

    Due to the manipulation of right-wing elements such as Chai Shou'an, right-wing elements accounted for the majority in the preparatory committee of the Fuxin City Democratic League, turning the preparatory committee into a command center for attacking the Party. After the Party Central Committee issued instructions for rectification, they lit fires and fanned the flames everywhere, encouraging some people who were dissatisfied with the Party to attack the Party. Chai Shou'an described the criticism she received in the anti-Hu Feng movement as "unjustified grievance." Before the Fuxin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China had arranged for rectification, the Democratic League's right-wing group held a secret meeting and decided to "supervise" the Party's rectification and "supervise" the Party's resolution of problems. They also lit fires and fanned the flames in many ways, creating rumors to confuse the public, and attempted to defeat the Party's leadership. (Zhao Chunlie)

    章罗联盟为实现其反党阴谋，采用各种卑鄙手段，大肆招兵买马扩展实力，以达到他们篡夺党的领导权的目的。这些情况过去在揭露章罗阴谋的一些报道中已有所反映，从这几个地方的报道里，可看出章罗联盟散布各地的爪牙，是怎样招兵买马发展组织进行卑鄙活动的。  
    民盟阜新市组织
    三个月起家就成了反党指挥部
    民盟阜新市筹委会办公室主任柴寿安向落后分子开门，三个月起家，组成了民盟阜新市筹委会。这个草草建成的民盟组织，立即结成右派集团，向党展开了猖狂进攻。
    在今年2、3月份以前，民盟在阜新只有矿务局业余中学教员柴寿安一个盟员，到6月初这里就建立了民盟市委的筹委会，盟员发展到三十七名。
    据揭露，柴寿安有意把一些对党不满的人和在政治运动中受过斗争的人作为发展对象，甚至对历史反革命分子也极感兴趣。她对这些人说，入盟有靠山，人权有保障，不管做错什么事，组织可以帮你说话，加入盟才能得到温暖。国民党特别党员、镇压过工人罢工斗争的阜新矿务局助理工程师房铸新等一些有着严重历史问题和对党不满的分子，都被拉进了盟内。
    由于柴寿安等右派分子的操纵，使右派分子在民盟阜新市委筹委会中占了多数，把筹委会变成向党进攻的指挥部。他们在党中央发出整风指示后就到处点火煽风，鼓动一些对党不满的人向党进攻。柴寿安把她在反胡风运动中受到的批判，说成是“含冤莫白”。在中共阜新市委还没有布置整风以前，民盟右派集团就开了个秘密会议，决定要“监督”党整风，“监督”党解决问题。并多方面放火煽风，造谣惑众，企图打垮党的领导。　（赵春烈）
