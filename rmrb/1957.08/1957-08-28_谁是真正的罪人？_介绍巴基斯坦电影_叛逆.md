　　The Asian Film Week gives our audience a chance to see the excellent Pakistani film "Rebellion." This is the first Pakistani film to be screened in our country, and a welcome event in the cultural exchange between the two countries. It will surely be of great help to the vast audience in our country in understanding the life of the Pakistani people and their artistic achievements.
　　"Rebellion" is a film full of clear love and hate. It exposes the irrational phenomena in real life, and depicts the extremely tragic and unfair experiences of a poor young man. His hard work could not save his family from being devoured by evil forces, and his resistance made him a "rebel" in society. The story is as follows: Young Akbar, due to poverty and the oppression of usurers, goes out to do odd jobs to make a living. As a result, the creditor takes away the money he sends back, repossesses the house, and drives his mother and sister out, leaving them to beg on the streets. When he returns to visit, his family is ruined. In anger, he goes to reason with the creditor. Unexpectedly, in the quarrel, the creditor accidentally kills a servant, falsely accuses him of robbery and murder, and throws him into prison. During his imprisonment, his mother is killed by a car, and his sister is sold by the creditor and becomes a prostitute. When the news arrives, Akbar is overwhelmed with grief and indignation. In order to avenge and find his sister, he risks escaping from prison. In the process of searching for his sister, he falls in love with the daughter of a tribal chief. However, the evil forces of society and the police are still chasing him step by step, and they kill his sister and lover. With blood and tears, he kills his enemy, leads his horse, carries the body of his lover, and surrenders to the pursuing police.
　　The story is gripping from beginning to end. When Akbar and his sister Najma are reunited, which is also when Najma is dying, she says:
　　"How can I say it! I know that an innocent brother can never bear to have his sister sold in the open market for her virginity.
　　God is my witness, my soul is still
　　pure, I was extremely abused, I was forced..." This is an accusation of blood and tears, how can it not be exciting! Also, when Akbar leads his horse, carrying the body of his lover, and walks towards the police force, we can't help but ask: Who is the real sinner?
　　The film's clear love and hate reflect the kindness and sincerity of the Pakistani people, which is so easy to resonate with the vast audience in our country! How easy it is to evoke a sense of intimacy.
　　The character designs of the main actors in "Rebellion" are successful, and the director's techniques also show his maturity. In particular, the music and songs with strong national flavor add a lot of color to the film, making the development of the plot more vivid and rich.
　　The film seems to have some shortcomings, that is, the handling of some story episodes and fighting scenes is a bit lengthy, which dilutes the development of the theme.
　　The Pakistani film industry is young. Under the hard work of Pakistani filmmakers, in just ten years, the art of film has reached such a good level, which is worth cherishing. We are delighted with the artistic achievements of our neighbor.

　　谁是真正的罪人？
　　——介绍巴基斯坦电影“叛逆”——
　　丁谷
    亚洲电影周，给我国观众一个机会，让我们看到邻国巴基斯坦的优秀的影片“叛逆”。这是巴基斯坦在我国上映的第一部电影，是两国文化交流活动中可喜的事件。它对我国广大观众了解巴基斯坦人民生活及其艺术成就，一定有很大的帮助。
      “叛逆”是一部富有明确爱憎的影片。它揭发了现实生活中的不合理现象，描写了一个穷困的青年的极其凄惨、极不公平的遭遇。他的辛勤劳动挽救不了恶势力对其家庭的吞啮，他的反抗却使他成了社会的“叛逆”。故事是这样的：青年阿克巴，由于穷困和高利贷者的逼迫，出外打零工谋生，结果债主又夺去了他寄回的钱，并收回了房屋，将他的母亲和妹妹逐出，流落街头行乞。当他回来探望时，已家破人亡，激愤之下，去和债主讲理，不料，在争执中，债主动武误杀佣人，反诬他抢劫、杀人，将他投入狱中。在他囚禁的岁月里，母亲被车撞死，妹妹又被债主出卖，沦为妓女。消息传来，阿克巴悲愤欲狂，为了报仇寻妹，冒险越狱而出，在寻找妹妹过程中，和一部落酋长女儿发生了爱情。但社会恶势力和警察还是步步追逼着他，并杀害了他的妹妹和爱人。含着血泪，他杀死了仇人，牵着自己的马，驮着爱人尸体，向追捕的警察自首。
    故事从头至尾紧扣人心。当阿克巴和他的妹妹娜杰玛重逢时，也就是娜杰玛临死的时候，她说：
    “我怎么能说呢！我知道，一个清白的哥哥永远不堪忍受他的妹妹在公开的市场里出卖她的贞节。
    真主是我的见证，我的灵魂仍然是
    圣洁的，我是被极度虐待的，我是被强迫的……。”这是血和泪的控诉，怎不令人激动！还有，当阿克巴牵着马，驮着爱人的尸体，走向警察队伍的时候，我们不禁要问：谁才是真正的罪人？
    影片中明确的爱憎，反映了巴基斯坦人民善良和真诚的感情，这种感情，对我国广大观众，是多么容易引起共鸣！多么容易唤起一种亲切的感觉。
    “叛逆”几个主要演员的造型是成功的，导演手法也显示了其成熟的程度。尤其是民族风味十分浓厚的音乐和歌曲，更给影片增色不少，它使故事情节的发展，更加生动和丰富了。
    影片似也有不足之处，即在处理有些故事插曲和格斗等场面上，稍嫌冗长，以致冲淡了主题的发展。
    巴基斯坦电影事业是年青的，在巴基斯坦电影工作者辛勤努力之下，仅仅十年时间，电影艺术已达到如此良好水平，这是值得我们珍视的。我们为我们邻国的艺术成就感到欣喜。
