　　The Silkworm-Raising Girl
　　Liu Xiangmei is a graduate of Haoji Elementary School in Xiaoxian County, Anhui Province. She is sixteen years old this year and lives in Xinting Agricultural Cooperative, Yanglou Township. Although she expressed to her teachers and the Youth League organization that she would happily participate in agricultural production if she could not continue her studies, she still felt a great deal of pressure in her mind after failing the entrance exams, and she could not even eat her meals. Guo Xiuzhi, the Secretary of the Yanglou Township Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, visited her parents and helped her resolve her ideological problems.
　　At that time, the county happened to be holding a silkworm-raising training class. She accepted the Party's education and happily went to learn silkworm-raising techniques.
　　After returning from her studies in the county, she brought back ten sheets of silkworm eggs. As a result, she actively organized four graduates, including Huang Jinfeng, Cui Jingliang, and Xiao Yuzhi, and six young women to form a silkworm-raising group. Under her leadership, this group has already begun raising silkworms. They plan to raise three batches of silkworms this year, and the first batch alone could bring in an income of 105 yuan. ·Sun Shanye　Song Wenzhang·

　　养蚕姑娘
    刘相美是安徽省萧县郝集小学毕业生，今年十六岁，住杨娄乡新庭农业社。她虽然向老师和团组织表示，不能升学就愉快地参加农业生产，但是落榜以后她思想上仍然感到很大的压力，饭也吃不下去。中共杨娄乡党委书记郭秀芝访问了她的家长，帮助她解决了思想问题。
    这时，正巧县里举办养蚕训练班，她接受了党的教育，愉快地去学习养蚕技术。
    她从县里学习回来，带了十张蚕子。于是，她就积极组织黄金凤、崔景良、肖玉芝等四个毕业生和六个青年妇女，成立了一个养蚕小组，在她的领导下，这个小组已经开始养蚕了。她们计划今年养好三期蚕，第一期蚕就可收入一百零五元。·孙善业　宋文章·
