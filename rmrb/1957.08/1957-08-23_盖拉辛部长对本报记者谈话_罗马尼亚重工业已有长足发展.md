Bucharest, August 21st (By Our Correspondent) On the eve of the 13th anniversary of Romania's liberation, our reporter interviewed Mr. Paul Gherasim, Minister of Heavy Industry of Romania, member of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party, and engineer. He introduced to the reporter the achievements Romania has made in heavy industry over the past thirteen years. He said that Romania has undergone tremendous changes in politics, economy, culture, and ideology over the past thirteen years. Thanks to the Workers' Party's firm implementation of the policy of national socialist industrialization, Romania has become a country with a highly developed industrial and agricultural economy.

    During the era of the people's democratic regime, the country's industry has been developed in a planned way. The total industrial output value in 1956 increased by 230% compared with the highest year (1938) under the landlord and bourgeois regime. In developing industry, the Party and the government ensured the priority development of heavy industry, while also taking into account the planned development of consumer goods industry. At present, heavy industry has become the leading force of the entire industry. In 1938, the proportion of heavy industry in the total industrial production was smaller than that of consumer goods industry (heavy industry accounted for 45.5% at that time), but now, although the total output value of consumer goods industry has increased considerably in absolute terms, the proportion of heavy industry is greater than that of consumer goods industry (heavy industry accounts for 57.6%). The rapid development of industry, especially the development of heavy industry, has changed the backward technical and economic conditions inherited from the old era, greatly improved the level of production, established a socialist economy, and laid the material foundation for continuously improving the living standards of the working people.

    Romania pays special attention to the development of the metallurgical industry and the machine-building industry, in order to ensure the technical transformation of the entire national economy. The metallurgical industry is developing rapidly, both modernizing the existing metallurgical equipment and building new, highly mechanized equipment.

    In order to meet the needs of the metallurgical industry, the coking industry will be developed on a larger scale in the next few years, based on the existing raw material conditions.

    The electrification of the production process plays a significant role in the rapid development of the machine-building industry. Last year, Romania's electricity production increased by 420% compared with 1948.

    Due to the large amount of investment in the processing industry, fifty-eight enterprises were newly built and expanded between 1950 and 1957. The level of technical equipment in the machine-building industry has increased fourfold compared with 1948. The total output value of the machine-building industry in 1956 increased by 2.6 times compared with 1950. Its proportion in Romania's total industrial production has risen from 10.5% in 1948 to 18.8% in 1955. The development of the machine-building industry has brought new technologies to Romania's national economy, equipping industry, agriculture, and transportation with modern technology.

    The continuous development of the machine-building industry can not only largely meet the domestic needs for petroleum machinery, agricultural machinery, mining and transportation machinery, but also export some machines.

    During the second Five-Year Plan period, the focus of Romania's industrial development is on the chemical, coal, petroleum, electricity, and building materials industries. Because Romania is rich in crude oil, marsh gas, coal, reeds, timber, and salt.

    The rapid development of Romania's heavy industry is inseparable from the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has equipped Romania with metallurgical plants, steel pipe plants, tool factories, and bearing factories. The Soviet Union has also transported iron sand, coke, and steel plates to Romania. In 1956, 75% of the imported iron sand, 100% of pig iron, 60% of coke, and 75% of steel plates came from the Soviet Union.

    Scientific and technological cooperation with the Soviet Union, and sending workers and cadres to the Soviet Union to study, are important methods for improving the production of Romania's heavy industry. The Soviet Union's multifaceted economic assistance and economic cooperation with socialist brother countries, including China, are important factors for the continued development of Romania's metallurgical and machine-building industries.

　　盖拉辛部长对本报记者谈话
　　罗马尼亚重工业已有长足发展
    本报布加勒斯特21日电　在罗马尼亚解放十三周年纪念日前夕，本报记者访问了罗马尼亚重工业部部长、工人党中央委员、工程师包·盖拉辛。他向记者介绍了罗马尼亚重工业十三年来所获得的成就。他说：十三年来，罗马尼亚在政治、经济、文化和思想意识方面都有巨大的变化。由于工人党坚定地执行了国家社会主义工业化的政策，罗马尼亚已成为一个工农业经济高度发展的国家。
    在人民民主政权年代，国家的工业已得到有计划的发展，1956年工业总产值比地主资产阶级政权时期最高的一年（1938年）增加了230％。在发展工业的时候，党和政府保证了优先发展重工业，同时也照顾到日用消费品工业的有计划的发展。目前，重工业已经成为整个工业的领导力量。在1938年，重工业在全部工业生产中的比重小于日用品工业（当时重工业占45.5％），而现在，虽然日用品工业的总产值有了绝对的相当大的增加，但重工业的比重已大于日用品工业的比重（重工业占57.6％）。工业的急速发展，特别是重工业的发展，改变了旧时代继承下来的技术—经济的落后状况，大大地提高了生产水平，建立了社会主义经济和奠定了不断提高劳动人民生活水平的物质基础。
    罗马尼亚特别注意发展冶金工业和机器制造业，以便保证整个国民经济的技术改造。冶金工业在迅速地发展着。一方面使旧有的冶金设备现代化，另一方面新建了高度机械化的设备。
    为了满足冶金工业的需要，在今后的几年中，将根据现有原料的情况，更大规模地发展炼焦工业。
    生产过程的电气化，对迅速发展机器制造业有着重大作用。去年罗马尼亚的电力生产比1948年增加了420％。
    由于对加工工业的大量投资，在1950到1957年间，新建和扩建了五十八个企业。机器制造业的技术装备水平，比1948年提高了四倍。1956年机器制造业的总产值比1950年增加了二点六倍。它在罗马尼亚整个工业生产中的比重，已从1948年的10.5％上升到1955年的18.8％。机器制造业的发展，给罗马尼亚的国民经济带来了新的技术，用现代化的技术装备了工业、农业和运输业。
    机器制造业的不断发展，不但已能大体上满足国内对石油机械、农业机械、矿业和交通运输机械的需要，而且还能出口一部分机器。
    在第二个五年计划期间，罗马尼亚工业发展的重点是化学、煤炭、石油、电力和建筑器材工业。因为罗马尼亚有丰富的原油、沼气、煤、芦苇、木材和盐。
    罗马尼亚重工业的迅速发展是同苏联的兄弟般的援助分不开的。苏联给罗马尼亚装备了冶金厂、钢管厂、工具厂和轴承工厂等。苏联还给罗马尼亚运来了铁砂、焦炭和钢板。1956年进口的铁砂的75％、生铁的100％、焦炭的60％、钢板的75％，都是从苏联来的。
    同苏联的科学技术合作，派工人及干部到苏联去学习，是改善罗马尼亚重工业生产的一个重要方法。苏联多方面的经济援助以及同包括中国在内的社会主义兄弟国家的经济合作，是罗马尼亚冶金和机器制造工业继续向前发展的重要因素。（附图片）
