Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 31st—A massive anti-Rightist struggle has unfolded at the Sixth Session of the First Guangdong Provincial People's Congress, which is currently being held.

In the six days since the meeting began, representatives have initially exposed twenty Rightists. After the representatives presented a large number of facts to refute them, they were all at a loss for words. Luo Yiqun, a member of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), who had slandered the people as being on the "brink of starvation," suddenly stood up to counter-accuse Lin Zhiguang of "adding guilt to others" when Lin Zhiguang, who had accompanied him on an inspection tour of rural areas, rose to testify that he had spread reactionary remarks in Pingyuan County. After the representatives rebuked him based on the facts, he dared not be arrogant again. Under the questioning of the representatives, Luo Yiqun admitted that he had dealings with Huang Shaohong in Beijing and Guangzhou and had given Huang Shaohong three distorted materials about the suppression of counterrevolutionaries, but he said that this was only an ideological alliance. Later, someone testified that when Luo Yiqun went to Beijing for a meeting, Huang Shaohong told him that after returning to Guangdong, he should propose to the Provincial Political Consultative Conference the establishment of a "rehabilitation" organization. At that time, Huang Shaohong also said to him: "You propose it in Guangdong, and I will propose it in the central government." Only then did Luo Yiqun admit to having a political alliance with Huang Shaohong. Yun Yinglin, who had close ties with Zhang Bojun and Li Boqiu and organized an anti-Party clique in Guangdong, attacked the Communist Party everywhere and refused to confess the activities of the reactionary clique, only saying that some reactionary remarks were due to "personal fame and gain thinking." Representative Mei Rixin immediately revealed that Yun Yinglin had greatly appreciated the fallacy of the Rightist Zhang Yunchuan about "12 million Communist Party members are 12 million housekeepers" at a central meeting of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. When Yang Yitang and Wang Yifan, the generals of Zhang Bojun, came to Guangzhou to stir up trouble, Yun Yinglin had conspired with them several times. In the face of the facts, Yun Yinglin had to confess the names of seven members of the reactionary clique.

    在广东省人民代表大会会议上
    右派分子被驳得抬不起头来
    据新华社广州31日电　在正举行的广东省第一届人民代表大会第六次会议上，展开了声势浩大的反右派斗争。
    会议进行六天来，代表们已初步揭露出了二十名右派分子。这些右派分子在代表们摆出大量事实进行驳斥以后，他们都已理屈词穷。曾污蔑人民已到“饿死边缘”的民革中央委员罗翼群，当和他同行下乡视察的林志光起来指证他在平远县散布反动言论时，竟突然站起来反咬林志光是“加罪于人”。当代表们根据事实对他进行斥责后，他才不敢再嚣张。在代表们的追问下，罗翼群承认他和黄绍竑在北京和广州时彼此有往来，并曾交过三分歪曲肃反的材料给黄绍竑，但他说这仅仅是思想联盟，后来有人指证，罗翼群到北京开会时，黄绍竑曾叫他回广东后要向省政协提出成立“平反”机构。当时黄绍竑还对他说：“你去广东提，我也在中央提。”罗翼群这才承认与黄绍竑有政治联盟。同章伯钧、李伯球有密切关系并且在广东组织了反党集团的云应霖曾经到处攻击共产党，并且拒不交代反动集团的活动，只说一些反动言论是出于“个人名位思想”所致。代表梅日新立即揭露云应霖曾在农工民主党中央会议上非常赏识右派分子张云川关于“一千二百万个共产党员是一千二百万个管家婆”的谬论，当章伯钧的大将杨逸棠、王一帆到广州点火时，云应霖曾同他们数次密谋。在事实的面前，云应霖不得不交代反动集团七人的名字。
