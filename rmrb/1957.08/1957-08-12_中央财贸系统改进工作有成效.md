Xinhua News Agency, August 10th. The Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Foreign Trade, the Ministry of Finance, and the People's Bank of China, among other units, have implemented the principle of "rectifying and reforming simultaneously," and have made many effective improvements in response to the problems and opinions raised by the masses during the rectification movement.

On the issues of cadre employment, ranks, and compensation, the Ministry of Foreign Trade system has already adjusted the work of thirty-two cadres, placing them in positions where they can utilize their talents; the Ministry of Finance has also dealt with individual cadres whose work was inappropriate or who had not been assigned fixed work for a long time. The Ministry of Commerce has drafted an adjustment plan to address inappropriate promotions and rank increases of cadres and is currently studying it.

During this period, the Ministry of Commerce and the head office of the People's Bank of China, implementing the spirit of transferring cadres downwards, decided to transfer a large number of cadres to strengthen grassroots organizations. The first batch of seventy cadres determined to be transferred from the Ministry of Commerce system, mostly section and division chiefs, have successively gone to provinces such as Qinghai, Yunnan, Jilin, and Heilongjiang. The head office of the People's Bank of China also plans to transfer 450 people to various provinces before the end of August, and more than 100 people have already departed.

The work style of leading cadres in many units has also greatly improved. All vice ministers and assistant ministers of the Ministry of Finance spend half a day each week specifically to meet with the masses; they have also changed their style of sitting in offices and have begun to go deep into various units to participate in meetings and understand the situation. Managers of the China National Animal By-Products Import & Export Corporation also frequently visit cadres' homes during holidays, and some leading cadres personally visit patients.

The most improved and widespread aspects in all units are some issues related to living welfare. These include the reasonable adjustment of dormitories, the reasonable distribution of welfare subsidies, and the cancellation of some unreasonable regulations in the past. Some leading cadres of the companies under the Ministry of Foreign Trade have already taken the initiative to give up more than thirty rooms and some furniture for other cadres to use. Units such as the China Tea Corporation and the Transportation Machinery Import Corporation have adjusted the housing of more than thirty cadres, and some Communist Party cadres have taken the initiative to give up dormitories close to the offices to non-Party cadres who need them for their work. The leading cadres of this ministry also took the initiative to return more than 3,800 yuan in various welfare subsidies and increased subsidies for some cadres with financial difficulties. These units also solved some welfare problems that cadres urgently needed to resolve. The Ministry of Foreign Trade changed the original regulations of the nursery, which gave priority to the children of leading cadres for enrollment, to enrolling children who meet the requirements regardless of their parents' rank. The Ministry of Commerce changed the nursery from "full-time care" to "day care," which can accommodate 99 more children, allowing children who could not previously be enrolled to enter the nursery, and can also reduce state subsidies by more than 17,000 yuan per year.

During the rectification movement, the masses also raised many opinions regarding the business policies and organizational structure of these departments. Now, the organizational structure of the head office of the People's Bank of China has been adjusted as necessary; the companies under the Ministry of Foreign Trade and the Ministry of Commerce have also improved internal division of labor, reduced reporting forms, and established some new systems on some specific business issues. The Planning Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce stipulates that the implementation of the commodity circulation plan will be reported once every quarter in the future to strengthen the inspection of the plan, and the Price Bureau has also begun to systematically organize price data from previous years.

In order to implement the principle of "counter-revolutionaries must be eliminated, mistakes must be corrected," these departments have generally reviewed the counter-revolutionary suppression work in their respective units since the beginning of the rectification movement and have corrected individual erroneous cases. People who were investigated in the counter-revolutionary suppression movement have expressed satisfaction and gratitude for the Party and government's realistic and truth-seeking spirit.

### 中央财贸系统改进工作有成效

    中央财贸系统改进工作有成效
    新华社10日讯　商业部、对外贸易部、财政部、人民银行等单位，执行边整、边改的方针，对群众在整风运动中提出的问题和意见，已作了不少有效的改进。
    在干部的使用和级别、待遇等问题上，对外贸易部系统已经调整了三十二个干部的工作，把他们安排在能够发挥自己才能的岗位上；财政部也对个别工作不恰当或者长期未分配固定工作的干部作了处理。商业部对干部提职、提级中不适当的情况，拟出了一个调整方案，正在研究。
    商业部和人民银行总行，在这一期间贯彻干部下放的精神，决定调出大批干部，加强基层机构。商业部系统第一批确定调出的七十人，大多数是科、处长一级的干部，已陆续到青海、云南、吉林、黑龙江等省去。人民银行总行也计划在8月底以前调往各省四百五十人，现在已有一百多人出发。
    许多单位领导干部的作风也有了很大改进，财政部所有的副部长和部长助理，每人每周有半天的时间，专门用来接见群众；他们还改变了坐办公室的作风，开始深入到各单位去参加会议，了解情况。中国畜产公司的经理们也经常利用假日到干部家中访问，有的领导干部还亲自去慰问病人。
    各单位改进得最多和最普遍的是有关生活福利上的一些问题。其中包括宿舍的合理调整、福利补助费的合理分配和取消过去一些不合理的规定等。对外贸易部所属各公司有些领导干部已经主动让出三十多间房屋和一部分家具给其他干部使用。中国茶业公司、运输机械进口公司等单位调整了三十多家干部的住房，有的党员干部把靠近机关的宿舍，主动让给工作上需要的非党干部住。这个部的领导干部还主动退回了各种福利补助费三千八百多元，并增加了对一些生活困难的干部的补助。这些单位还解决了一些干部迫切需要解决的福利问题。对外贸易部把托儿所原规定的领导干部的子女可以优先入托，改为不论那级干部的子女只要合格就录取。商业部把托儿所由“全托”改为“日托”，可以多收九十九个孩子，使原来不能入托的孩子都进了托儿所，每年还可以减少国家补贴一万七千多元。
    对于这些部门的业务方针、组织机构等问题，整风运动中群众也曾提出了不少意见。现在人民银行总行的机构已作了必要的调整；对外贸易部和商业部所属各公司，也就一些具体业务问题，改进了内部分工、减少表报、建立了一些新的制度。商业部计划局规定今后每季通报一次商品流转计划执行情况，加强对计划的检查，物价局也已着手系统地整理历年来的物价资料。
    这些部门为了贯彻“有反必肃、有错必纠”的方针，整风运动开始以来，普遍对本单位的肃反工作进行了复查，对于个别错误案件作了纠正。在肃反运动中被审查的人对于党和政府这种实事求是的精神，都表示满意和感激。
