    Tianjin People's Bank Employees Harshly Criticize
    Cunning Li Xitian Begins to Confess His Crimes
    (Reported by our newspaper) Employees of the Tianjin Branch of the People's Bank of China actively exposed and criticized the anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist remarks of Li Xitian (member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang), deputy section chief of the Agricultural Credit Department of the bank and a rightist.
    During the period of Great Blooming and Letting, Li Xitian frantically attacked the Party from all aspects. He said: "Now most intellectuals think this way: anyway, they can't overthrow the Communist Party, so they might as well follow the Communist Party." He then added: "But you can't say that either; didn't Hungary overthrow the Communist Party?" He slandered the Communist Party as being not as good as the Kuomintang, and slandered the Party as a sectarian group. He purposefully proposed that "business is primary and politics is secondary." And he said:
    "Can you handle business just because you understand Marxism-Leninism? To regard Marxism-Leninism as a panacea is dogmatism." He slandered the Party's political and ideological work as "political noise." Li Xitian also viciously slandered the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries movement as: "'If one is determined to condemn someone, one can always trump up a charge,' creating something out of nothing, bluffing and intimidating, needlessly hurting the (cadres') self-esteem and initiative, making everyone afraid, making people afraid to uphold justice, with more bad results than good."
    While exposing Li Xitian's reactionary remarks, the employees of the Tianjin People's Bank launched a serious debate with him based on reasoning. The employees pointed out that Li Xitian's helpless cry that "anyway, the Communist Party cannot be overthrown, so I have to follow the Communist Party" fully demonstrated the "distress" in his heart, meaning that he wanted to overthrow the Communist Party but lacked the power. In fact, he was not willing to follow the Communist Party. Moreover, he used the Hungarian incident as an analogy, harboring the illusion of bourgeois restoration.
    After the start of the anti-Rightist struggle, Li Xitian's attitude was very cunning, repeatedly claiming: "Comrades have misunderstood my meaning," or "I can't remember." Later, after repeated exposure by the masses and confronting him face to face, he was forced to admit that he was anti-Party and anti-socialist.

    天津人民银行职工严词批驳
    狡猾的李锡田开始认罪
    本报讯　中国人民银行天津市分行职工积极揭发和批判该行农业信贷处副科长、右派分子李锡田（民革成员）的反党、反人民、反社会主义言论。
    在大鸣大放期间，李锡田曾经猖狂地从各个方面向党进攻。他说：“现在大部知识分子都这样想：反正也革不了共产党的命，跟着共产党走吧。”他接着又说：“可也不能这样说，匈牙利不就革了共产党的命吗？”他污蔑共产党还不如国民党，污蔑党是一个宗派主义的集团。他别有用心地提出“业务是第一性的，政治是第二性的”。并说：
  “是否懂了马列主义就能处理业务呢，把马列主义看作万宝囊，那就是教条主义。”他把党的政治思想工作污蔑成“政治噪声”。李锡田还恶毒地污蔑肃反运动是：“‘欲加其罪，何患无词’，无中生有，唬唬诈诈，平白伤了（干部的）自尊心和积极性，使人人害怕，让人不敢主持正义，坏的结果多，好的结果少。”
    天津市人民银行的职工们在揭发李锡田这些反动言行的同时，对他展开了严肃的说理斗争。职工们指出，李锡田说“反正也革不了共产党的命，只好跟着共产党走”，这一无可奈何的呼声，充分表现了他内心的“苦闷”，这意思就是说他要想革共产党的命，可是力不从心。实际上他并不甘心跟着共产党走。不仅如此，他还用匈牙利事件作比喻。抱着资产阶级复辟的幻想。
    在反右派斗争开始后，李锡田的态度十分狡猾，一再推说：“同志们把我的意思体会错了”，或是“记不起来了”。后来经过群众的一再揭发，并和他当面对质，他才被迫承认自己是反党反社会主义。
