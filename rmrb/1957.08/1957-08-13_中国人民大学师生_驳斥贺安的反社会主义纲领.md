This newspaper specially transmits reports by Ma Dajun and Lü Yingfan:

    Just as right-wing elements Ge Peiqi and Wang Dezhou were frantically attacking the Party and the people, and just as right-wing element Lin Xiling (Cheng Haiguo) was using her shameless slanders to incite people's dissatisfaction with the Party and socialism, right-wing element He An, a lecturer in the Department of Industrial Economics, also put forward his anti-Party and anti-socialist program at the Western Suburbs debate at the university on June 7. In this way, they and all the right-wing elements inside and outside the university formed a "grand chorus of opposition" and echoed each other. However, there were also levels of skill among them. Ge Peiqi and Wang Dezhou were too inept, and their "opposing tunes" were immediately seen through by the people. Lin Xiling's arguments, in He An's view, were "conceptually very vague" and full of loopholes, while He An's "magic weapon" was relatively "clever." He "steadily" presented his program of "the root causes of the 'three evils' and measures to eradicate the 'three evils.'"

    Such a "Prescription"

    During the rectification movement, He An put on the face of a "benevolent" doctor and sighed heavily: The Communist Party's "condition is serious" and should be "operated on immediately." Now let us see how this "benevolent" doctor diagnoses and prescribes medicine.

    At the beginning of his speech, He An analyzed that "the 'three evils' are like a tree, and sectarianism is the root of the tree... To eliminate the 'three evils,' the root must first be pulled out." We say that the root should be found from the vestiges and ideological origins of the old society, but our "Doctor" He An, when analyzing the root causes of the three isms, again put on the appearance of a philosopher, babbling about internal and external causes. He insisted that the root cause of the three isms was the problem of the new social system. He said, "Whether society is good or reasonable is the condition for the breeding of various viruses and bacteria." He opposed the view that the three isms were "vestiges of the old society." He asked smugly, "How can the vestiges of the old society be nurtured, developed, and play a role in the new society? This belongs to the problem of the system." The purpose of He An's analysis starting from the three isms is to accuse our National People's Congress of being "hemiplegic" and to slander that the cause of this is the existence of "Party leadership replacing government" in our country, and that the Party committee system is the manifestation of "Party leadership replacing government." Therefore, he clamored, "Change the Party committee system and the situation of Party leadership replacing government, abolish the Party committee system, and change it into a people's congress system consistent with the national polity." Here, He An's true colors were exposed. In fact, he wanted our Party to abandon leadership and implement bourgeois democracy.

    Here, He An slandered the Party and the Chinese people in every possible way. He portrayed Party organizations and Party members as "congenitally deficient" and "acquiredly imbalanced," thus "producing sectarianism" to the point of "all under heaven is Party land." He slandered Party members as some "completely muddling officials" and "semi-muddling officials." Due to the development of this situation, "many Party members, especially new Party members, have developed from the Party committee system to the Party member system, and Party leadership replacing government has developed to Party member leadership replacing government. What Party members say counts." He said that Party members all joined for "profit," thus reaching his conclusion: "Therefore, the side effects of 'Party leadership replacing government' are great." Look, isn't our Party portrayed as a mess in his writing? No wonder He An wanted to pull out the root of sectarianism. So he diagnosed: "This disease is highly infectious, has a high reproduction rate, a low mortality rate, cannot be immune for life, has a long incubation period, and is hereditary." According to his diagnosis, wasn't our Party already incurable? Fortunately, the doctor was "benevolent" after all, and with his "compassionate heart" prescribed a prescription for our Party, which is what he boasted about, the "dual-track consistent People's Congress system." The so-called dual-track means one track for the regional system and one track for the production system. The so-called consistent means implementing the People's Congress system into every cell of political life (from class, grade, and department to the school). This means that People's Congresses must be established in every cell of social life, not only People's Congresses in the regional system but also People's Congresses in the production system. He An was still a "magnanimous" person after all. He said, "Some people say they cannot accept my opinion, saying that you are pushing the Party out of the school. No, the Party must stay in the school, but the leadership style is different." He An advocated abolishing the Party's organizational leadership. This is the prescription for destroying the Party and the country that He An prescribed.

    Is it Fragrant Flower or Poisonous Weed?

    In order to make it easier for everyone to identify fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds, the school organized no fewer than ten debates of various sizes before and after. He An thought that his anti-Party and anti-socialist program was much more "meticulous" than Lin Xiling's, and he thought he would get more support than those who supported Lin Xiling. However, things went against his wishes. Except for a few lackeys who followed him to cheer him on, no one at the debate supported his opinion. Although some people who supported Lin Xiling were secretly happy, they themselves were already in a state of embarrassment and could not take care of themselves. At several debates, He An's arguments were refuted one after another. He also arrogantly declared: "My thoughts may be wrong, but the suggestion of a dual-track consistent system should be said to be a fragrant flower. Don't negate the fragrant flower just because you are铲毒草 (Chǎn dúcǎo, shoveling poisonous weeds - idiom). I put forward this suggestion to checkmate you. You can't refute me now. It looks like it's a draw." But his so-called "dual-track consistent system" was not a fragrant flower, and it did not end in a draw. His arrogant fallacy was immediately strongly refuted by Associate Professor Su Xing. Su Xing said, "The production academy, or the producer academy, is not a new thing. Anarcho-syndicalism had this idea a long time ago." He said that after the victory of the October Revolution in the Soviet Union, there was a tendency in 1921, and the "Workers' Opposition" at that time inherited the ideas of anarcho-syndicalism. They proposed that "the power to organize and manage the national economy should belong to the All-Russian Congress of Producers united in the trade unions of producers, and these producers should elect the central organs to manage the national economy of the republic." Comrade Su Xing said: "This requirement seems to be the same as He An's suggestion." Su Xing said that Lenin sharply and profoundly criticized this tendency and made a special resolution on syndicalism and anarchist tendencies at the Tenth Congress of the Russian Communist Party in 1921. Lenin pointed out in the draft resolution: This tendency completely deviates from Marxism and communism and is completely separated from the practical experience of the proletariat. Because, first, "the concept of 'producer' completely deviates from class distinctions and class struggle; second, relying solely on non-Party masses and catering to the masses is a fundamental betrayal of Marxism." Su Xing said that He An was very vague in answering the concept of producers, saying that producers are the people, including exploiters. Su Xing said: "This is obviously a fundamental mistake, 'exploiters are also producers'! Isn't this exactly Zhang Naiqi's proposition? (Unfortunately, Zhang Naiqi doesn't dare to say it so bluntly.) If, on the other hand, it is believed that producers are producers, then the production academy will become the workers' and peasants' academy, completely excluding other people with civil rights. Then what kind of 'People's' Congress will it be? According to his own answer, obviously, the purpose of He An's suggestion is the former, not the latter. In this way, he used the concept of 'producer' to obliterate class distinctions and confuse exploiters and laborers, which is just right for the needs of the bourgeoisie." In this way, the dictatorship of the proletariat is actually shaken.

    At the debate on June 28, comrades launched a general attack on his stubborn "dual-track consistent People's Congress system." As a result, He An's arguments were completely shattered.

    Professor Wu Dakun gave a heavy blow to He An's fallacy of slandering the National People's Congress as a "hemiplegic" system. According to He An's view, the "NPC" can only be "implemented from the regional system, and there is no production system." He An asked, "Who is the representative of the higher education system? There is none." Professor Wu Dakun said: "Although our people's representatives are elected by various regions, the interests they represent are not limited to the interests of the electoral districts in which they were produced." He asked with vivid examples: Does Comrade Wu Yuzhang only represent his Sichuan electoral district in the National People's Congress and not our Renmin University? I checked the list of representatives of the National People's Congress, and I found that almost all the principals of universities and colleges in the country are representatives of the National People's Congress, and our various local People's Congresses also have responsible people from the education circles of our various localities as representatives. Why does He An insist that there is no 'representative' in the higher education system? In the National People's Congress and in the local People's Congresses at all levels, there are also industrial labor models. Why does He An say that in today's People's Congress system, the production system has become a 'hemiplegic' situation? This is obviously talking nonsense with his eyes open." In this way, He An's lies were completely exposed.

    Lecturer Sun Guohua of the Law Department believes that He An's "dual-track consistent system" is not only theoretically absurd, but also impossible to realize in practice. He said: "If the People's Congress is promoted to all fields of social life, and People's Congresses are established in every unit such as factories, schools, and enterprises, that is to say, a level of people's power must be established. Even classes and grades are like this. Comrades, think about how absurd this is!" He said that if a school wants to establish a People's Congress of the school, first, this "People's Congress" can never represent the people of all strata of our country; second, it cannot exercise the power of the state power organ (People's Congress). If it exercises this power, it will inevitably create an independent small kingdom, and every small cell of social life will become a small people's government. If this is implemented, even the children in the nurseries will have to elect their ayis (nannies/housekeepers)."

    He An said: "Why can the organs of state power implement the People's Congress system, but production units such as factories, schools, and the army cannot?" We all know that the reason why factories, schools, the army, etc., cannot adopt the People's Congress system is because they are not political power organizations. By their nature, they are fundamentally different from the organs of state power. Because "factories are industrial production enterprises, schools are educational institutions for training cadres, and the army is a powerful tool for defending the people's political power. In short, they are organizations that undertake certain economic, political, and cultural tasks given by the organs of state power. They belong to the whole people, not to the employees of a certain factory, the students and workers of a certain school, or the officers and soldiers of a certain unit." Therefore, "their tasks cannot be arbitrarily decided by the employees and students, etc., but must be uniformly stipulated by the state organs representing the whole people."

    As Comrade Sun Guohua said: If we implement He An's plan, what will be the consequences for our country? It will inevitably (1) abolish the Party's leadership over state organs; (2) abolish the state's management of factories, enterprises, and schools; (3) make it impossible for our state power organs at all levels to realize their functions of economic organization and cultural education work; (4) inevitably weaken and undermine the unity of the people. The people originally discuss and decide issues together in the People's Congresses at all levels under the leadership of the Communist Party, but now, according to He An's plan, each industry must form its own system and each govern its own affairs, and in the center, "the two houses will have disputes." In this way, the country will be in a state of division; (5) If his "plan" is implemented in the army, the army will not be commanded by the Party or led by the state. The army originally belongs to the people, but now he wants to use guns to command the Party and the state. Does He An still want the Chinese people to relive the tragic days of warlord separatism?

    The Fox's Tail Cannot be Hidden

    He An's father was a commander of a "suppression" unit in Rehe during the enemy and puppet regime and had accumulated blood debts. He An shielded him for more than a year. During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, our public security organs had already mastered the materials of his father. At this time, He An had to hand over his father to the government for legal action. He An participated in the Three People's Principles Youth League and carried out reactionary activities.

    Now the fallacies of the right-wing element He An have been completely refuted. The small group that conspired with him has also disintegrated. If He An still insists on not understanding, then this road of self-destruction from the people is his own choice.

    中国人民大学师生
    驳斥贺安的反社会主义纲领
    本报特约马大军、吕英凡报道：
    正当右派分子葛佩琦、王德周向党、向人民猖狂进攻的时候，正当右派分子林希翎（程海果）用她无耻的谰言煽动人们对党对社会主义不满的时候，右派分子工业经济系讲师贺安也在6月7日在该校西郊辩论会上提出了他的反党反社会主义纲领。这样，他们和校内、外一切右派分子就组成了“反调大合唱”，相互呼应。但是，他们之间也有高低之分。葛佩琦、王德周太低能了，他们的“反调”马上就被人们识破；林希翎的论点在贺安看来则是“概念上非常模糊”，漏洞很多的，而贺安的“法宝”却比较“高明”，他是“四平八稳”地拿出他的“‘三害’产生的根源及根除‘三害’的措施”的纲领来的。
    如此“药方”
    在整风运动中，贺安摆出一付“仁慈”的医生面孔，沉重叹息道：共产党“病情严重”，应“即动手术”。现在我们看看这位“仁慈”的大夫究竟如何诊断和下药的。
    贺安在他的发言里，一开始就分析了什么“三害好像一棵树，宗派主义是树根……除三害要先把根拔掉。”我们说要找根应该从旧社会的遗毒和思想根源方面去找，而我们的贺安“大夫”在分析三个主义根源时，却又摆出了一付哲学家的样子，胡扯什么内因呀外因呀，他硬说产生三个主义的根源是新社会的制度问题。他说“社会的好坏是否合理，是产生各种病毒，各种细菌繁殖的条件”，他反对把三个主义归之为“旧社会遗留物”的说法，他很自得地问道：“请问旧社会的遗留物如何在新社会得到滋长、发展、起作用？这就属于制度问题啦”。贺安之所以从三个主义分析开始，其目的是在于指责我们人民代表大会是“半身不遂”的，并诬蔑造成这种原因的就是我国存在着“以党代政”，而党委制就是“以党代政”的表现形式，于是他叫嚣“把党委制，以党代政的情况改变一下，不要党委制，改变成为与国家政体相一致的人民代表大会制。”这里，贺安的原形就毕露了，实际上他是要我们党放弃领导，实行资产阶级民主制。
    在这里，贺安对党对中国人民进行了百般诬蔑，他把党组织和党员描绘成“先天不足”，“后天失调”，因而“产生宗派主义”以至
  “普天之下，莫非党土”，诬蔑党员是一些“全混官”、“半混官”，由于这种情况发展的结果，“很多党员，特别是新党员中，由党委制发展成为党员制，以党代政发展到以党员代政，党员说的话就算”，说党员都是为了“有利可图”钻进来的，这样就得出了他的结论：“所以‘以党代政’的副作用就大了”。看看吧，我们的党在他笔下不是被描绘成一团糟么？无怪乎贺安要拔掉宗派主义这个根。于是他下诊断说：“这种病传染性强烈，繁殖率高，死亡率少，不能终身免疫，潜伏期长，具有遗传性”。照他这种诊断，我们的党不是已经不可救药了么？好在医生毕竟是“仁慈”的，以他“恻隐之心”给我们党开了一个处方，这就是他所吹嘘的“双轨一贯人民代表大会制”。所谓双轨：就是区域系统一轨，生产系统一轨，所谓一贯，就是把人民代表大会制贯彻到政治生活的各个细胞中去（在学校由班、年级、系到学校），这就是说在社会生活的每个细胞中都要成立人民代表大会，不仅有区域系统的人民代表大会，而且有生产系统的人民代表大会制。贺安究竟还是一个“宽宏大量”的人，他说：“有人说接受不了我的意见，说你是把党委推出学校，不是，党委一定要留在学校，但领导方式不同了”，贺安主张取消党的组织领导。这就是贺安所下的亡党、亡国的药方。
    是香花，还是毒草？
    学校为了便于让大家识别香花和毒草，前后组织了大小不下十次的辩论会。贺安满以为他的反党反社会主义纲领比林希翎的要“缜密”得多，他想一定会得到比支持林希翎更多的人支持，但是，事违人愿，除了跟随他的几个喽啰为他摇旗呐喊外，辩论会上竟无一人支持他的意见，虽然有些支持林希翎的人暗暗欢喜，但是他们本身已狼狈不堪，自顾不暇了。在几次辩论会上，贺安的论点一个接着一个被驳倒了。他还狂妄的宣称：“我的思想可能有错误，但是双轨一贯制的建议应该说是香花，你们不要因为铲毒草而把香花也否定了。我提出这个建议是将了你们一军，你们现在还不能驳倒我，看样子是和棋”。但是他的所谓“双轨一贯制”并不是什么香花，更没有下成和棋。他的这种狂妄的谬论马上受到苏星副教授强有力的驳斥，苏星说：“生产院，或生产者院，并不是新的东西。很早以前无政府工团主义就有过这种主张”，他说苏联在十月革命胜利后，在1921年也曾有过这种倾向，当时的“工人反对派”就承袭了无政府工团主义的主张。他们提出“组织国民经济管理之权应属于联合在生产者职工会内的生产者的全俄代表大会，由这些生产者选出管理共和国全国国民经济的中央机关。”苏星同志说：“这个要求和贺安的建议看来是一样的”。苏星说：列宁尖锐深刻的批判了这种倾向，并且在1921年俄国共产党第十次代表大会上作了关于工团主义与无政府主义倾向的专门决议。列宁在这个决议草案中指出：这种倾向完全脱离马克思主义和共产主义而且和无产阶级的实际经验完全分割。因为，第一、
  “生产者”的概念，完全离开了阶级区别和阶级斗争；第二、专靠非党群众，逢迎群众，是从根本上背弃马克思主义。苏星说贺安在回答生产者这个概念时很含混，说什么生产者就是人民，并且包括剥削者在内。苏星说：“这显然是根本错误，‘剥削者也是生产者’！这不正是章乃器的主张吗？（可惜章乃器还不敢说得这样露骨）如果反过来，认为生产者就是生产者，那么生产院就成为工人农民院，把其他有公民权的人民完全排挤出去，那么还成什么‘人民’代表大会呢？根据他自己的答复，显然的，贺安建议的目的是前者，而不是后者，这样，他就用‘生产者’的概念，抹杀了阶级区别，使剥削者和劳动者混淆起来，正好适合于资产阶级的要求”。这样，实际上动摇了无产阶级专政。
    在6月28日的辩论会上，同志们向他的负隅顽抗的“双轨一贯人民代表大会制”发动了总攻击，结果贺安所持的论点完全被粉碎了。
  吴大琨教授对贺安诬蔑全国人民代表大会是一种“半身不遂”的制度的谬论给予了沉重的回击，根据贺安的看法，说“人大”只能“从区域系统贯彻下去，生产系统就没有了”，贺安问道：“谁是高教系统的代表，就没有了，”吴大琨教授说：“我们人民代表虽然是由各个地区选举产生的，但是他们所代表的利益，却完全并不限于他们所产生的选区的利益的，”他以生动的实例问道：难道吴玉章同志在人民代表大会里是只代表他的四川选区而并不代表我们人民大学吗？我查了一查全国人民代表大会的代表名单，我发现几乎全国高等学校的校长，都是全国人民代表大会的代表，我们的各级地方人民代表大会里也都有着我们的各个地方的教育界负责人士作代表，为什么贺安硬说在高教系统内“代表”就没有了呢？在全国的人民代表大会里，在各级的地方人民代表大会里，也有工业劳动模范，为什么贺安说在今天的人民代表大会制度内生产系统成了“半身不遂”的情况呢？这显然是睁开眼睛胡说。这样，贺安的谎言便完全揭穿了。
    法律系孙国华讲师认为贺安的“双轨一贯制”不仅理论上是荒谬的，而且在实际中也不可能实现。他说：“如果把人民代表大会推行到社会生活各个领域去，在工厂、学校、企业，每一个单位都成立人民代表大会，也就是说要成立一级人民政权，连班、年级都这样，同志们想想这是多荒谬呀！”他说如果一个学校要成立一个校的人民代表大会，第一，这个“人民代表大会”绝不能代表我国各阶层的人民；第二，它也不能行使国家权力机关（人民代表大会）的权力，如果行使的话势必造成独立的小王国，每个社会生活的小细胞都要成为一个小的人民政府，这样贯彻下去，连保育院的小朋友也得选举阿姨了。”
    贺安说道：“为什么政权机关可以实行人民代表大会制，而生产单位如工厂以及学校、军队等就不能实行呢？”我们大家都知道，工厂、学校、军队等之所以不能采取人民代表大会制就因为他们不是政权组织，它们按性质说来是与国家权力机关根本不同的。因为“工厂是工业生产的企业机构，学校是培养干部的教育机构，军队是保卫人民政权的强有力工具，总之，它们都是担负着政权机关给予的一定经济、政治、文化任务的组织。他们是属于全民所有，而不是属于某个工厂的职工人员，某个学校的学工人员和某个部队的官兵人员所有。”因此，“他们的任务并不是可以由职工和学员等随意自行决定的，而必须由代表全民的国家机关统一规定。”
    正如孙国华同志所说的：如果按照贺安的方案实行，我们国家将遭到什么样后果呢？必然会（1）取消了党对国家机关的领导；（2）取消了国家对工厂、企业、学校的管理；（3）使我们各级政权机关无法实现其经济组织工作和文化教育工作的职能；（4）必然削弱和破坏人民内部的团结，人民本来是在各级人民代表大会中，在共产党领导下共同讨论和决定问题的，而现在按贺安的方案却要由各行业自成系统各自为政，而在中央则要“两院发生争执”，这样国家将成为四分五裂的状态；（5）如果把他的“方案”推行到军队中，这样军队既不受党的指挥，也不受国家的领导，本来军队是属于人民的，而现在却想用枪杆来指挥党，指挥国家，难道贺安还要中国人民重新过军阀割据的悲惨日子吗？
    遮不住的狐狸尾巴
    贺安的父亲是敌伪时热河的一个讨伐大队长，有过累累的血债，贺安把他包庇了一年多，镇反时，我们公安机关已掌握了他父亲的材料，这时，贺安才不得不把他父亲交给政府法办。贺安参加过三青团，进行过反动活动。
    现在右派分子贺安的谬论已完全被驳倒了，原来和他同谋的小集团也瓦解了，如果贺安仍要执迷不悟，那么，这条自绝于人民的道路是他自己选择的。
