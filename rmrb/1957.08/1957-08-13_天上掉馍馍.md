    M馍馍 Falling from the Sky

    "If you're not meant to go hungry, 馍馍 will fall from the sky." This is a common saying. Now, 馍馍 really did fall from the sky.

    On July 26th, an airplane circled the Liu Ji area of Juye, Shandong. After circling for a while, people suddenly saw the plane tilt its wings, and many things were thrown from above. Curious people went to the north of Liu Ji Village and saw sacks and sacks of wheat cakes everywhere. It was dropped six times, totaling sixty-seven sacks, five thousand seven hundred and sixty catties. Some old men stroked their beards with joy, old women smiled with tears in their eyes, young men chatted and laughed as they helped carry the sacks to the township government, and girls smiled and talked on the side. "...馍馍 falling from the sky, really!" Someone said this proverb again, but was immediately interrupted by a loud voice: "No, it's from Beijing!"

    天上掉馍馍
    “该着不挨饿，天上掉馍馍。”是人们常说的一句俗话。现在，真的从空中掉下馍馍来了。
    7月26日，一架飞机在山东巨野刘集一带绕圈子。转了一会，忽然看到飞机翅膀一斜，许多东西从上边抛下来。好奇的人们到刘集村北一看，尽是一麻袋一麻袋的面饼。抛了六次，共计六十七麻袋，五千七百六十斤。一些老大爷们高兴得直摸胡子，老大娘们笑出了眼泪，小伙子们说笑着帮助把麻袋往乡政府扛，姑娘们在一边抿着嘴笑着、谈着。“……天上掉馍馍，真是！”又有一个人说这句俗话，但立刻被一个响亮的声音打断：“哪里，这是北京来的啊！”
