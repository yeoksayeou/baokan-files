Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 8th. The application process for the first group of 300 members sought by the joint agricultural cooperatives in the Shanghai suburbs concluded today. Within the three-day application period, 860 young people with a junior high school education or higher had applied.

In recent days, long queues formed early in the morning at the Bile Middle School gate, the registration point in Shanghai's urban area. Among those queuing were the children of workers, government officials, teachers, and high-level intellectuals. Some students were accompanied by their parents. Wu Suzhen, a junior high school graduate from Shanghai No. 8 Girls' Middle School, in order to be the first to register, got up at 3:00 AM on August 6th and arrived at the registration point at 5:00 AM, only to find that others had arrived even earlier. Zhang Xinzhai, a junior high school graduate from Cuiwen Middle School, originally intended to become an apprentice in a factory, but after learning that the agricultural cooperative was recruiting members, he decided to apply. His father is the Party Committee Secretary of the No. 16 State Cotton Factory, and his mother is also a Party cadre. His parents strongly encouraged him to participate in agricultural labor. Junior high school graduates from Shanghai Xincheng, Chengdu, and other middle schools came to register collectively, and the students and teachers of the schools sent them to the registration point with gongs and drums. The directors of each agricultural cooperative patiently introduced the situation of the agricultural cooperative to the students. All the students who participated in the registration stated in conversations with the directors of the agricultural cooperatives that they "will not be flowers in a greenhouse, but will be pines and cypresses in the cold wind," and they guaranteed that they would be able to endure hardship and settle in the countryside for a long time.
