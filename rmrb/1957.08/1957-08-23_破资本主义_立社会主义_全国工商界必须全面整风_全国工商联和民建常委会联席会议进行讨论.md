　　Destroy Capitalism, Establish Socialism
　　National Industrial and Commercial Circles Must Conduct a Comprehensive Rectification Campaign
　　Joint Meeting of the Standing Committees of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and China Democratic National Construction Association Held Discussions
　  Xinhua News Agency, 22nd - In order to launch a comprehensive rectification movement in the national industrial and commercial circles with the content of opposing rightist elements and destroying the capitalist stance and establishing a socialist stance, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and the China Democratic National Construction Association will jointly convene a meeting of the Central (Executive) Committee of the two associations in early September to formally decide and promote this movement. This was decided at a joint meeting of the Standing Committees of the two associations held today.
    The meeting held that after the capitalist ownership of the means of production has been basically changed to socialist ownership, the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts has not been completed. Especially judging from the situation of the anti-rightist struggle in industrial and commercial circles, most industrialists and businessmen have not carried out the necessary transformation of their political positions. Therefore, it is completely necessary to widely carry out the rectification movement in the national industrial and commercial circles. The meeting unanimously approved the decision proposed by Chen Shutong and Huang Yanpei, chairmen of the two associations, and agreed upon by the vice chairmen of various regions, to quickly convene a joint meeting of the Central (Executive) Committee of the two associations, and to use this meeting to set off a new upsurge in the socialist transformation of industrial and commercial circles.

　　破资本主义　立社会主义
　　全国工商界必须全面整风
　　全国工商联和民建常委会联席会议进行讨论
　  新华社22日讯　为了在全国工商界中展开一个以反对右派分子和破资本主义立场、立社会主义立场为内容的全面整风运动，全国工商联和中国民主建国会将在9月上旬联合召开两会中央（执行）委员会议，正式决定和推动这一运动。这是今天举行的两会常委联席会议上决定的。
    会议认为，在生产资料的资本主义所有制基本上改变为社会主义所有制以后，政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命并没有完成，特别是从工商界反右派斗争的情况看来，多数工商业者对他们的政治立场并没有进行必要的改造，因此在全国工商界中广泛开展整风运动是完全必要的。会议一致通过了由两会主任委员陈叔通和黄炎培提出、并已征得各地副主任委员同意的迅速召开两会中央（执行）委员联席会议的决定，并且要通过这个会议，在工商界掀起社会主义改造的新高潮。
