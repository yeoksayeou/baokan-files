　　Xinhua News Agency, Taipei, 21st. News: Nearly 80,000 old and weak Chiang soldiers have been eliminated by the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek group according to a joint US-Chiang plan. This was announced by Brent, the head of the US International Cooperation Administration in Taiwan.

　　Brent said that the US and Chiang Kai-shek groups implemented this joint plan, ordering a large number of old, weak, and disabled Chiang soldiers to retire, at a time when both the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek group had "growing concerns" because Chiang's army was "getting older and weaker."

　　Brent said that the dismissed Chiang's old, weak, and disabled soldiers are not given pensions, etc., in order to avoid increasing the economic burden on the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek group.

　　Recently, Taiwanese newspapers have often revealed news of retired Chiang's old, weak, and disabled soldiers being displaced, starving, and committing suicide.

　  蒋军日暮途穷
　　八万老弱残兵流离失所
    新华社21日讯　台北消息，已经有将近八万名蒋军老弱士兵，被美国和蒋介石集团根据一项美蒋联合方案加以淘汰。这是美国国际合作署驻台湾负责人布伦特宣布的。
    布伦特说，在美国和蒋介石集团都因蒋军“愈来愈老愈弱”，因而有着“不断增长的忧虑”的时候美蒋执行了这个联合方案，下令大批蒋军老弱残兵退伍。
    布伦特说，被遣散的蒋军老弱残兵都不发给养老金等，以免增加美国和蒋介石集团的经济负担。
    最近，台湾报纸上常常透露退伍的蒋军老弱残兵流离失所、饥饿自杀等消息。
