Combined dispatches from our newspaper: According to Xinhua News Agency on August 13th: The Omani Imam's representative in Cairo, Harsey, said on the 12th that the Omani people will learn from China's example. China fought against imperialism for 120 years, and continued to resist during this period until victory was achieved.

Harsey said on the same evening that he had received a telegram from Oman on the afternoon of the 11th saying that fighting was still continuing in Nizwa and Firq. The telegram said that Imam's men only abandoned these castles after the British Royal Air Force carried out eight hours of continuous bombing of the Nizwa and Firq castles.

The telegram pointed out: "The Nationalists still maintain their fighting strength." The telegram said: "Throughout our history, the enemy may occupy our country, but they will never stay there for long."

The Egyptian "People's Daily" praised the heroic Omani nationalist forces for defending the cause of Arab nationalism and demanded that the United Nations stop the British aggression against the Omani people.

Sadat, editor-in-chief of "Republic Daily," wrote on the 12th that even if British troops could achieve a despicable victory on the battlefield, the Omani people would never perish and never surrender.

Sadat also said that the United States once again exposed in the Oman war that the Eisenhower Doctrine was not for the independence of the Arabs or the peace of the Arab region. Dulles' visit to London only resulted in the British barbarously massacring unarmed Omani people.

At the same time, according to "Evening News," many Egyptian youths have applied to the Omani Imam's representative office in Cairo, willing to volunteer to fight alongside the Omani people against British imperialism. The head of the representative office, Harsey, confirmed this news, saying that the Egyptian people expressed their support for the Omani people's liberation struggle.

In addition, according to a London dispatch: A British Foreign Office spokesman said on August 12th that Britain does not recognize the legal basis for the Arab League's decision to submit the Oman issue to the United Nations Security Council, calling the issue a matter of "internal jurisdiction" for the Sultan of Muscat.

The spokesman indicated that the British government supports the Sultan of Muscat's unilateral tearing up of the Treaty of Sib, signed in 1920 between the Sultanate and the Imamate of Oman, saying that the treaty is "no longer valid."

    阿曼教长代表说起义者仍保持战斗力量
    将学习中国榜样斗争到最后胜利
    埃报指责美国鼓励英国屠杀阿曼人民
    本报综合报道　据新华社13日讯：阿曼教长驻开罗代表哈尔塞12日说，阿曼人民将学习中国的榜样，中国对帝国主义进行了一百二十年的斗争，在这个时期内继续不断地进行抵抗运动直到取得胜利。
    哈尔塞在同一天晚间说，他收到11日下午从阿曼发出的电报说，尼兹瓦和菲尔克的战斗仍在继续中。电报说，只是在英国皇家空军对尼兹瓦和菲尔克城堡进行了八小时连续不断的轰炸以后，教长的部下才放弃这些城堡。
    这份电报指出：“民族主义者仍然保持着他们的战斗力量。”电报说：“在我们的整个历史上，敌人可能侵占我们的国家，但是决不能在那里呆很长时间。”
    埃及“人民报”赞扬英雄的阿曼民族主义部队保卫了阿拉伯民族主义事业，并且要求联合国制止英国对阿曼人民的侵略。
    “共和国报”主编萨达特在12日写道：即使英国军队在战场上能够得到卑鄙的胜利，阿曼人民永远不会灭亡，永远不会投降。
    萨达特还说：美国在阿曼战争中再一次暴露出艾森豪威尔主义并不是为了阿拉伯人的独立或者阿拉伯地区的和平，杜勒斯去伦敦访问的结果只是英国人野蛮地屠杀手无寸铁的阿曼人民。
    同时，据“晚报”报道，许多埃及青年向阿曼教长驻开罗代表处申请愿意作为志愿兵去同阿曼人民一起战斗，反对英国帝国主义。代表处负责人哈尔塞证实了这一个消息：他说，埃及人民对阿曼人民的解放斗争表示支持。
    另据伦敦消息：英国外交部的发言人8月12日说，英国不承认阿拉伯联盟决定将阿曼问题提交给联合国安全理事会的法律根据，他把这个问题说成是马斯喀特苏丹“内部管辖”的问题。
    这个发言人表明，英国政府支持马斯喀特苏丹片面撕毁苏丹和阿曼教长国在1920年签订的西卜条约的行动，他说，这个条约已“不再有效”。
