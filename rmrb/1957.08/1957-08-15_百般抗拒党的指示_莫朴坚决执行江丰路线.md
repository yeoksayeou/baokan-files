Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 14th. The faculty, staff, and some students of the East China Branch of the Central Academy of Fine Arts have been holding meetings for days, exposing the fact that Mo Pu, a key member of the Jiang Feng anti-Party clique, implemented Jiang Feng's anti-Party line.

Since Jiang Feng was transferred to Beijing in the autumn of 1951, the rightist Mo Pu, using his authority as vice president, resolutely implemented Jiang Feng's anti-Party line. In 1954, when the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party went to inspect the work, they discovered errors in their implementation of the central government's policies on traditional Chinese painting and intellectuals. They instructed Mo Pu to immediately restore the reputation and position of the downgraded old professors. However, Mo Pu repeatedly delayed and resisted the Party's instructions until the Provincial Committee questioned him. Only then did he change those dismissed professors into nominal "researchers" with ulterior motives.

In 1953, in order to correct Jiang Feng's erroneous actions towards traditional Chinese painting, the Ministry of Culture instructed the Fine Arts Branch to re-establish the Department of Traditional Chinese Painting. Mo Pu, however, feigned compliance while acting in opposition. He named the newly established Department of Traditional Chinese Painting the "Colored Ink Painting Department." He also stipulated that the department should focus on painting figures, promote New Year pictures, and oppose all traditional Chinese painting art.

Mo Pu has consistently hated and opposed the leadership of the Party, which is in line with Jiang Feng's rejection of the Party committee system. He often openly slandered the Party organization on various occasions, saying, "Our school is not under the control of the central government, nor of East China, and the Provincial Committee has been managing it for several years, but it's getting worse and worse." After the Three-Anti Campaign, the Provincial Committee found that the political atmosphere in the academy was weak, so it sent Gao Shan to the school to form a Party committee. Mo Pu then proclaimed: "The Party committee cannot interfere with administration; it can only assist in the completion of administrative work." He also did not allow major issues in the school to be brought to the Party committee for discussion.

When Mo Pu knew that the Party committee system could not be abolished, he openly proposed the "one-chief system," urging everyone not to study the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee on strengthening the collective leadership system, but instead to study articles publicizing the "superiority of the factory one-chief system." He attempted to place individual power above the Party committee. He also often attributed the school's achievements to Jiang Feng and himself.

### 百般抗拒党的指示  莫朴坚决执行江丰路线

    百般抗拒党的指示
    莫朴坚决执行江丰路线
    本报特约新华社杭州14日电  中央美术学院华东分院全体教职员工和部分学生，连日举行会议，揭露了江丰反党小集团骨干分子莫朴执行江丰反党路线的事实。
    从1951年秋江丰调到北京以后，右派分子莫朴，利用他副院长的职权，坚决贯彻江丰的反党路线。1954年，中共浙江省委去检查工作时，发现他们在执行中央对国画和知识分子的政策上有错误，要莫朴立即恢复被降级的老教授的名誉和职位，莫朴却一再拖延、抗拒党的指示，直到省委提出责问时，他才别有用心地把那些被撤职的教授改为名义上的“研究员”。
    1953年，中央文化部为了纠正江丰对待国画的错误行动，指示美术分院重新建立国画系。莫朴竟阳奉阴违，把新建立的国画系定名为“彩墨画系”。并规定这个系要以画人物为主，提倡画年画，反对一切国画的传统艺术。
    莫朴一贯仇视和反对党的领导，和江丰的不要党委制是一脉相承的。他经常在各种场合公开污蔑党组织，他说“我们学校是中央不管，华东不管，省委管了几年越管越糟。”三反以后，省委发现学院中政治空气薄弱，就派高山到学校去组成党委会，莫朴就扬言：“党委不能干涉行政，只能协助行政工作的完成”。他又不许把学校里重大事情拿到党委会上来讨论。
    当莫朴知道党委制不能取消时，就公然提出了“一长制”，不要大家学习中央七届四中全会加强集体领导制的决议，而要大家学习有关宣传“工厂一长制的优越性”的文章。企图把个人权力凌驾于党委之上。他又时常把学校的成绩，归功于江丰和他自己。
