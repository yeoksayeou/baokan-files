Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, August 30th: The Chinese men's and women's volleyball teams have concluded their friendly competition tour in Poland. Today, the women's volleyball team departed for home, while the men's volleyball team traveled to Czechoslovakia for a visit.

The Chinese men's and women's volleyball teams were invited to Poland for friendly matches after participating in the Third International Youth Friendship Games in Moscow. After competing with Polish athletes in Gdansk, they traveled to Poznan on August 25th to play friendly matches with the Start team. The Chinese women's team won against the Start team three to zero, and the men's team won three to one. Afterward, they went to Zielona Góra to compete against the local representative team. The Chinese teams both won with a score of three to zero.

The Chinese men's and women's volleyball teams achieved more wins than losses during this visit and competition in Poland. This is unprecedented for Chinese teams since they began competing in Poland in 1952. The Chinese teams suffered repeated defeats when they competed in Poland in 1952. Although the situation improved in 1954 and 1955, they still lost more than they won. After this visit, many Poles believe that the Chinese teams have made great progress in recent years.

The Chinese teams were warmly welcomed everywhere they went in Poland. Even when the vehicles carrying the team members stopped on the road, many Polish friends would gather around to greet them enthusiastically.

    中国男女排球队在波兰结束比赛
    新华社华沙30日电　中国男女排球队在波兰各地的访问比赛已经结束。今天女子排球队启程返国；男子排球队也前往捷克斯洛伐克访问。
    中国男女排球队是在莫斯科参加第三届国际青年友谊运动会后，应邀到波兰访问比赛的。他们在革但斯克市同波兰运动员举行了比赛后曾经在25日到波兹南同斯塔特球队举行了友谊比赛。中国女子队以三比零、男队以三比一胜斯塔特队。以后，他们又去绿山同这个地方的代表队比赛。中国队均以三比零获胜。
    中国男女排球队这次在波兰访问比赛的结果，胜多败少。这是中国球队自从1952年起在波兰举行比赛以来，从未有过的现象。中国球队1952年在波兰比赛的时候屡次败北。1954、1955年的情况虽然有好转，但是仍是胜少败多。经过今年这次访问以后，许多波兰人认为中国球队几年来进步很大。
    中国球队这次在波兰各地倍受欢迎，甚至当球队队员乘坐的汽车在路上暂停的时候，都有许多波兰朋友围上来热情招呼。
