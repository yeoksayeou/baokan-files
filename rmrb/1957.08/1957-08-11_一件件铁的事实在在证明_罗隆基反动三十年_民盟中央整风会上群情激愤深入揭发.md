    Ironclad Facts Prove Luo Longji's Thirty Years of Reactionary Activities
    Mass Criticism and In-depth Exposure at the Democratic League Central Committee Rectification Meeting

    (Our Newspaper) This paper reports: Has Luo Longji consistently been a friend of the Communist Party and the people, or has he consistently been an enemy of the Communist Party and the people? This question was fully explained at the sixth enlarged rectification forum of the Central Committee of the Democratic League held yesterday afternoon.

    At the beginning of the meeting, Hu Yuzhi, Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Democratic League, asked Luo Longji to honestly confess his past and present attitude towards the leadership of the Communist Party. This rightist ringleader still cunningly and vaguely put several hats on himself, refusing to confess any facts or thoughts. Luo Longji's attitude of resolutely refusing to bow his head to the people aroused great anger among those present. Many people immediately questioned him and asked him to explain his relationship with the "Little Hungary Incident" in Hanyang County, which he and Ma Zhemin had planned. Luo Longji still insisted that he had not sent anyone there or written to anyone in recent years to carry out reactionary activities. He said that if he was forced to confess, he would only "pass the buck by labeling people."

    Although Luo Longji refused to honestly confess his crimes of consistently being an enemy of the Communist Party and the people, the large number of facts revealed at the meeting still proved that Luo Longji had consistently opposed the Communist Party and the people for thirty years. Wu Han pointed out in his speech that Luo Longji was not only consistently pro-American and anti-Communist, but also, more than twenty years ago, he had offered advice to Japanese imperialism in the "New Moon" magazine he edited, asking the national enemy at that time to oppose communism, saying that "the victory of the CCP is not only a disaster for China, but also not a blessing for Japan." In 1948, the Third Plenary Session of the Democratic League had already decided to cooperate closely with the CCP. However, just as the People's Liberation Army was overwhelmingly eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, Luo Longji arrogantly made a request to the Party to share power equally. Wu Han said that Luo Longji had asked him to bring a letter to Shen Junru, who was already in the liberated area, making the following requests to the CCP: 1. Oppose the pro-Soviet one-sided foreign policy and demand the implementation of the so-called harmonious foreign policy that was pro-American; 2. Cancel the CCP cross-party members in the Democratic League; 3. The Democratic League should have its own political program. Luo Longji also declared that if these conditions were not accepted, the Democratic League would withdraw from the coalition government and retreat to become an opposition party. Even after the founding of the People's Republic of China, Luo Longji still opposed the leadership of the Communist Party and demanded from Premier Zhou Enlai face to face to "take turns to be the landlord" (i.e., take turns ruling), saying that "you represent a part of the people, we represent a part of the people, let's all cooperate and form a coalition government."

    Luo Longji was most afraid of others exposing Chu Anping's fallacy of "the Party's world" and his connection with it. Liang Sicheng revealed that in the "New Moon" magazine more than twenty years ago, Luo Longji had slandered the proletarian dictatorship as "the Party's world." Luo Longji said that the proletarian dictatorship was "a one-party dictatorship" and that "the Party is above the country." He called the theory that the state would disappear with the elimination of classes as "abolishing the country with the Party." He also said: "The Kuomintang can copy the CCP's tactics and put the Party above the country. Why can't other parties copy the Kuomintang's articles and put the Party above the country? Qin Shi Huang, Liu Bang, Cao Cao, Sima Yi... after conquering the world, of course, they become emperors, this is the story of 'the family's world'. The Kuomintang's revolution is successful, it can be said that 'the Party is above the country', and of course, other parties can also say that 'the Party is above the country' when their revolution is successful." Luo Longji also wrote articles in "New Moon" magazine praising the heinous fascist leader Mussolini of Italy, regretting that China did not have such a person, saying that "if China had a person like Mussolini, a group of small people would definitely be willing to praise him, welcome him, obey him, and support him. Unfortunately, China does not have such a person..."

    In his previous confessions, Luo Longji always slanderously slandered the late former chairman of the Democratic League, Zhang Lan, and even pushed some of his own evil deeds onto Zhang Lan. He thought that this was a case where the dead could not testify. Yesterday, Lu Guangguang, Zhang Lan's former secretary, came out to testify, exposing Luo Longji's lies and revealing a series of crimes committed by Luo Longji in order to realize his anti-communist conspiracy, including coercing, kidnapping, framing, and even scolding Chairman Zhang Lan. For example, Luo Longji once said that he did not go to the liberated area in 1948 because he was influenced by Zhang Lan. Lu Guangguang said that in reality, Luo Longji colluded with secret agents to obstruct Zhang Lan from going to the liberated area. At that time, Zhang Lan had already decided to go to the liberated area, but Luo Longji told Zhang Lan that the Kuomintang secret agents were monitoring him closely and that he could not escape, and he also pulled Zhang Lan into the Hongqiao Sanatorium. From then on, Zhang Lan was subjected to even stricter surveillance by the Kuomintang secret agents. Lu Guangguang's exposure aroused great indignation among those present. Luo Longji became angry and stood up and shouted without the permission of the chairman, saying that this was "deliberate framing" and "arbitrary fabrication." Immediately, someone stood up to confirm Lu Guangguang's speech and questioned Luo Longji, but Luo Longji continued to deny it. The people present unanimously indignantly demanded that the chairman stop Luo Longji's rogue behavior.

    Zhou Xinmin then spoke, he was responsible for guaranteeing that what Lu Guangguang revealed was true. He said that from Zhang Lan's arrival in Beijing in 1949 to his entry into the hospital in 1955, for nearly six years, I had to see Zhang Lan almost every week, and he had also told me some of the things he had told Comrade Lu Guangguang. Zhou Xinmin also revealed Luo Longji's reactionary behavior of opposing the resolution of the Third Plenary Session of the Democratic League, supporting Li Zongren's campaign for the pseudo-presidency, and attempting to negotiate secretly with Li Zongren on the eve of the People's Liberation Army's crossing of the river, so that the Democratic League would take over Li's "National Government."

    Luo Longji has always refused to admit the Zhang-Luo alliance and his reactionary small clique. At this meeting, his confidant Zhao Wenbi revealed many private anti-communist and anti-socialist talks that Luo Longji had with him, and proved that the Zhang-Luo alliance did exist. He also revealed some facts about Luo Longji directing his reactionary small clique. Zhao Wenbi said that after he came to Beijing, when he asked Luo Longji whether he wanted to work for the Democratic League, Luo Longji said to him: "The situation has changed now, and Bojun and I are very close." Luo Longji also instructed Zhao Wenbi that he should start from the grassroots level first. In April, another confidant of Luo Longji, Fan Puzhai, also said to Zhao Wenbi: "Zhang and Luo are very close now." After the anti-rightist struggle began, Zhao Wenbi was worried that Zhang Bojun would "sell out" Luo Longji, but Fan Puzhai said: "This time it won't happen." At yesterday's meeting, Luo Longji also said that he had not sent anyone to engage in reactionary groups in recent years. Zhao Wenbi revealed: Luo Longji once asked Fan Puzhai to bring a message to Peng Wenyin, Chen Renbing, and Zhao Wenbi in Shanghai, asking them to maintain unity, do a good job, gain trust, and wait for the opportunity. Luo Longji also conveyed the same words through Pu Xixiu, and told Chen Renbing himself. Luo Longji also wrote letters to tell Zhao Wenbi about the situation of his "small circle" in Beijing. In 1953, when Luo Longji went to Shanghai, Zhao Wenbi suggested to him not to compete with Shen Zhiyuan, but to use the method of supporting Shen to win him over in order to maintain his position. Luo Longji agreed and did so. In addition to his speech at the meeting, Zhao Wenbi also handed over some letters that Luo Longji had given him.

    Fei Xiaotong and Wang Jinding successively revealed how Luo Longji used intellectuals to attack the Party. Fei Xiaotong said that Luo Longji's conspiracy to use intellectuals to attack the Party was a conscious action taken after a long period of deliberation, and it was by no means an "accidental" mistake as he himself said. Fei Xiaotong used Luo Longji's speech at the report meeting on the issue of senior intellectuals convened by the Democratic League in February 1955, his speeches at the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in 1956 and 1957, and his speech at the National People's Congress in 1956 as examples to illustrate that Luo Longji had consistently painstakingly and maliciously provoked the relationship between the Party and intellectuals, and even did not hesitate to fabricate facts to incite intellectuals' dissatisfaction with the Party. Luo Longji said that the Party did not trust intellectuals politically or academically. He encouraged intellectuals to be "heroes who stand out," to rely on their own abilities, to fully reveal all their thoughts and goods, and to compare themselves with Marxism-Leninism. He also arrogantly declared that Marxism-Leninism would eventually be eliminated and cleared out.

    Wu Yuheng pointed out in his speech: Luo Longji spoke up for Hu Feng, Chen Kun, Wang Shizhuo (Chen and Wang were both targets of the anti-counter-revolutionary struggle, and their materials have been exposed in the newspapers). Luo Longji deeply regretted Hu Feng's case, claiming that Hu Feng was not a counter-revolutionary and that putting Hu Feng in jail offended three million intellectuals. Wu Yuheng said that if Luo Longji's "Rehabilitation Committee" was established, he would definitely overturn the case for Hu Feng first.

    Pu Xixiu also revealed some of Luo Longji's conspiracies to hate the Communist Party and depend on American imperialism. In May and June 1948, when Pu Xixiu was working at the Xinmin Daily in Nanjing, Luo Longji suddenly sent her an article from Shanghai supporting Li Zongren's campaign for the pseudo-presidency, and instructed her: Do not use Luo Longji's name, but use the pseudonym "Laski's disciple" to publish it in the Xinmin Daily. Pu Xixiu said: Luo Longji was nominally recuperating in Shanghai at that time, but in fact, he was secretly engaging in despicable activities for Li Zongren's campaign for the pseudo-presidency. Until the eve of Shanghai's liberation, Luo Longji and Li Zongren were still colluding with each other. At that time, he wanted the American Consul General in Shanghai to forward a letter to Lu Deng, the American Consul General in Guangzhou, and asked Lu Deng to hand it over to Qiu Gongwei and Gan Jiehou, subordinates of Li Zongren, to pass it on to Li Zongren. Pu Xixiu affirmed: I believe that this relationship is still maintained to this day. Last year, Zhou Jingwen had a secret talk with Luo Longji before going to Hong Kong.

    Pu Xixiu also revealed that after liberation, Luo Longji went to Beijing and still missed American imperialism. His purpose in colluding with Zhang Dongsun, Zeng Zhaolun, and others was for this. He once said that Zhang Dongsun's collusion with American third-rate spies was unpromising, while he himself always wanted to get in touch with American first-rate spies.

    The speakers at this meeting also included Hua Luogeng, Zeng Zhaolun, and Gao Xuegu, a teacher at Beijing No. 43 Middle School (formerly Xiyin Middle School).

    一件件铁的事实在在证明
    罗隆基反动三十年
    民盟中央整风会上群情激愤深入揭发
    本报讯　罗隆基是一贯与共产党和人民为友呢，还是一贯与共产党和人民为敌呢？这个问题，在昨天下午举行的民盟中央第六次整风扩大座谈会上，得到了充分的说明。
    会议开始，民盟中央秘书长胡愈之要求罗隆基老实交代他过去、现在，对共产党的领导究竟采取什么态度。这个右派头子，依然狡猾地空洞地给自己戴了几顶帽子，闭口不交代任何事实和思想。罗隆基这种坚决不向人民低头的态度，引起到会者的极大愤怒。许多人立即向他提出了质问，并要他交代和马哲民策动的汉阳县的“小匈牙利事件”的关系。而罗隆基仍然一口咬定几年来根本没有向那里派过人和向谁写过信，要他们进行反动活动。他说，一定要他交代，他只有“扣帽子过关”了。
    尽管罗隆基不肯老实交代他一向与共产党和人民为敌的罪行，但是会上揭发的大量事实，仍然证明罗隆基三十年来一贯反共反人民。吴晗在发言中指出，罗隆基不但一贯亲美反共，而且，在二十多年前，还曾在他所主编的“新月”杂志上向日本帝国主义献策，要求当时的民族敌人来反共，说什么“中共胜利，固为中国之祸，亦非日本之福”。1948年民盟三中全会已经决定和中共密切合作，而正当解放军以排山倒海之势大举消灭蒋介石匪帮的时候，罗隆基就狂妄地向党提出了分庭抗礼的要求。吴晗说，罗隆基曾要求他带信给已在解放区的沈钧儒，向中共提出如下的要求：一、反对亲苏的一边倒外交政策，要求实行亲美的所谓协和外交政策；二、取消民盟中的中共交叉党员；三、民盟要有自己的政治纲领。罗隆基还声言，如果不接受这些条件，民盟就要退出联合政府退居为在野党。直到中华人民共和国成立以后，罗隆基仍然敌视共产党的领导，当面向周恩来总理要求
  “轮流做庄”（即轮流执政），说什么“你们代表一部分人民，我们代表一部分人民，大家共同协议合作，组织联合政府”。
    罗隆基最怕别人揭发储安平的“党天下”的谬论和他有关，梁思成却揭露了二十多年前的“新月”杂志上，罗隆基就诬蔑无产阶级专政是“党天下”。罗隆基说无产阶级专政是“一党独裁”，是“党在国上”。他把随着阶级的消灭，国家也将消灭的理论称之为“以党废国”。他还说：“国民党可以抄共产党的策略，把党放在国上。别的党又何尝不可抄国民党的文章，把党放在国上。秦始皇、刘邦、曹操、司马懿……打下了天下，当然做皇帝，这就是
  ‘家天下’的故事。国民党革命成功，可以说‘党在国上’，其他的党革命成功，当然亦可以说‘党在国上’。”罗隆基还在“新月”杂志上写文章歌颂意大利万恶的法西斯头子墨索里尼，很为中国没有墨索里尼这样一个人而惋惜，说什么“倘若中国有墨索里尼这样的一个人，一班小民，一定甘心情愿去歌颂他、奉迎他、顺从他、拥护他。不幸，中国又没有这样的一个人……。”
    罗隆基在他的历次交代中总是信口雌黄地污蔑已故的前民盟主席张澜，甚至把他自己的一些恶行推到张澜身上。他以为这是死无对证的事了。昨天张澜生前的秘书吕光光出来作证，揭穿了罗隆基的弥天大谎，并且揭露了罗隆基为了实现反共阴谋，而要狭、劫持、陷害以至辱骂张澜主席的一系列罪行。比如，罗隆基曾说他自己1948年没有到解放区，是因为受了张澜的影响。吕光光说，实际上是罗隆基勾结特务阻挠张澜去解放区。当时本来张澜已决定到解放区去，但是，罗隆基却告诉张澜说，国民党特务监视严密，要走也走不掉，而且还把张澜也拉进虹桥疗养院去。从此，张澜就受到国民党特务的更加严密的监视。吕光光的揭发，引起到会者极大的愤慨。罗隆基这时恼羞成怒，不经主席许可，就站起来大喊大叫，说这是“有意陷害”，这是“任意捏造”。会上立即有人起来证实吕光光的发言，并对罗隆基提出质问，罗隆基继续抵赖。到会的人一致愤慨地要求主席制止罗隆基这种无赖行为。
    周新民接着发言，他负责保证吕光光所揭发的都是事实。他说，从张澜1949年来到北京，到他1955年进入医院，这将近六年间，我几乎每周都要看张澜一次，他也曾把告诉过吕光光同志的一些事情告诉过我。周新民还揭露了罗隆基反对民盟三中全会决议，支持李宗仁竞选伪总统，在人民解放军渡江前夕，企图和李宗仁秘密谈判，由民盟接管李记“国民政府”的反动行为。
    罗隆基一直不肯承认章罗联盟和他的反动的小集团。在这次会议上，他的亲信赵文璧揭露了罗隆基和他谈过的许多反共反社会主义的私房话，并且证明章罗确有联盟，他还揭露了罗隆基指挥他的反动小集团的一些事实。赵文璧说，他来北京后，曾问罗隆基要不要兼搞民盟的工作时，罗隆基和他说：“现在形势变了，我和伯钧很要好”。罗隆基还指示赵文璧目前要先从基层搞起。4月间，罗隆基的另一亲信范朴斋也和赵文璧说：“目前章罗拉得很紧”。反右派斗争开始后，赵文璧担心章伯钧会“出卖”罗隆基，范朴斋却说：“这次不会”。罗隆基在昨天的会上还说他这几年没有给谁带过信或派过谁去搞反动集团。赵文璧揭发：罗隆基曾托范朴斋带口信给在上海的彭文应、陈仁炳和赵文璧，要他们保持团结，搞好工作，取得信任等待时机。同样的话，罗隆基还通过浦熙修传达过，并且亲自告诉陈仁炳。罗隆基还曾写信把他在北京的“小圈子”的情况告诉赵文璧。1953年，罗隆基到上海时，赵文璧向他建议不要和沈志远相争，要用拥护沈以争取沈的办法来保持地位。罗隆基同意而且照办了。赵文璧在会上发言之外，还交出了罗隆基给他的一些信件。
    费孝通和汪金丁先后揭发罗隆基怎样利用知识分子向党进攻。费孝通说，罗隆基利用知识分子向党进攻的阴谋活动，是经过长期的谋虑而采取的自觉行动，决不是如他自己所说的是什么“偶然”的错误。费孝通以罗隆基在1955年2月在民盟召开的高级知识分子问题汇报会上的发言、1956年和1957年在政协全国委员会的发言，以及1956年全国人民代表大会上的发言为例，说明罗隆基一贯煞费心机地恶毒地挑拨党和知识分子的关系，甚至不惜捏造事实煽动知识分子对党的不满。罗隆基说党对知识分子在政治上学术上都不信任，他鼓励知识分子要做“脱颖而出的英雄”，要凭自己的本领，把自己所有的思想、货物全盘托出，和马列主义比比高低。他还狂妄地宣称马列主义最后会被淘汰被清除。
    吴昱恒在发言中指出：罗隆基为胡风、陈堃、王士倬（陈、王均为肃反斗争对象，他们的材料，报纸上已经揭发）等喊冤，罗隆基为胡风深抱不平，扬言胡风不是反革命分子，把胡风关起来是得罪了三百万知识分子。吴昱恒说，如果罗隆基的“平反委员会”成立了，他一定首先替胡风翻案。
    浦熙修也揭发了罗隆基一些仇恨共产党依附美帝国主义的阴谋活动。1948年5、6月间，浦熙修在南京新民报工作时，罗隆基忽然从上海写了一篇支持李宗仁竞选伪总统的文章寄给她，还嘱咐她：不要用罗隆基的名字，而用“拉斯基一门徒”的假名在新民报上发表。浦熙修说：罗隆基那时名为在上海养病，实际上却在暗中为李宗仁竞选伪总统进行卑鄙活动。一直到上海解放前夕，罗隆基和李宗仁还是勾勾搭搭。当时，他曾要上海美国总领事转广州美国总领事路登一封信，要路登交给李宗仁的部下丘公渭、甘介侯转达给李宗仁。浦熙修肯定地说：这个关系，我相信至今还保持着，去年周鲸文去香港前，就曾和罗隆基密谈过。
    浦熙修还揭发，解放以后，罗隆基到北京，对于美帝国主义仍念念不忘。他和张东荪、曾昭抡等勾勾搭搭的目的就是为此。他曾说张东荪勾结美国三等特务不争气，而他自己始终想和美国头等特务搭上关系。
    在这次会议上发言的，还有华罗庚、曾昭抡、北京市立四十三中学（原惜阴中学）教师高学古。
