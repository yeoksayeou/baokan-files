The facts of the past few months have demonstrated that stubborn resistance, sophistry, retreating step by step, and even attempting to counterattack are the performances of Yun Yinglin, a rightist element, member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, vice chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Committee, member of the Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, and deputy director of the Supervisory Office of the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee, in the anti-rightist struggle.

His many past anti-Party and anti-people criminal activities were exposed and refuted by all the cadres of the Provincial Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, the Supervisory Office, and the Provincial People's Congress held not long ago. Initially, he only admitted that he was a "solo rightist element," claiming that due to the development of his pursuit of fame and position, he became dissatisfied with the Party and only attempted to "sit on an equal footing with the Communist Party, share the limelight equally, be half a catty to its half a catty," and "did not want to overthrow the Communist Party." However, after further exposure and struggle by the representatives, he had to take a step back and admit that there was a right-wing group, admitting that "there was a conspiracy coming down from above, which was planned and had strength."

This right-wing group had indeed formed long ago.

In April of last year, Zhang Bojun's henchmen, Yang Yitang and Wang Yifan, came south from Beijing one after another. In November, Li Boqiu also came. They all had secret talks with rightist elements such as Yun Yinglin in the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party.

According to Yun Yinglin's confession, Yang met him at Qiu Zhe's house in Guangzhou and instructed him to transform the problem of attacking Mei Rixin (member of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party) into a confrontation with the United Front Department of the Provincial Committee and the Communist Party. Li Boqiu said to Yun and others: The situation has changed! Many aspects are dissatisfied with the Communist Party, and there will be major changes. Quickly replenish your strength, so that you can do something when the time comes.

This year, when Yun Yinglin was in Beijing, Li Boqiu and Yang Yitang also analyzed the situation for him, saying that "democracy" would be greatly expanded, and even the landlords in the countryside would rise up. He was told to seriously and intensively carry out work and not relax. Li Boqiu also emphasized that in the future, they should maintain close contact, and many tasks would be assigned to them, so they should quickly establish strongholds, consolidate and expand the group, and cope with changes.

During this period, a right-wing anti-Party group consisting of seven people, including Yun Yinglin, Qiu Zhe, Li Jiezhi, Chen Zhuofan, Liao Silan, Yang Piaotang, and Huang Daqiang, was formed within the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party. Yun Yinglin admitted that he actually pulled this group together. In an attempt to get rid of the leadership of the Communist Party, they first controlled the general office of the Provincial Committee of the Party, and tried every means to attack and squeeze out progressive elements who leaned towards the Communist Party, and arranged for their own people. Yun Yinglin once said: "The reason why the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party is placed so far behind is because there are few people and little capital." Therefore, they conspired to take over the more than 400 social intellectuals registered with the Provincial Political Consultative Conference to expand their influence. Yun Yinglin also planned to go to various parts of the province with Chen Zhuofan to establish strongholds.

After the rectification began, Yun Yinglin, this right-wing vanguard, started charging. He stirred up trouble, fabricated rumors, viciously slandered, and shot poisoned arrows, with the apparent intention of fighting the Communist Party to the death. He expressed agreement with the fallacy of "Party rule of the world." He greatly appreciated the nonsense that "the Communist Party now has 12 million members, which means the democratic parties now have 12 million mothers-in-law." Moreover, he proposed abolishing the Party group within the Supervisory Office. As early as July of last year, when he inspected Hainan Island, he started a fire, saying: "The People's Government has no democracy, the people dare not speak, and the reports of Party and government at all levels are all lies." During the rectification, he also said: "The meetings of the People's Committees at all levels hardly discuss or study before passing resolutions." Originally, as early as when the central government put forward the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," he emphasized "organizational independence, political freedom," and emphasized extreme democracy without leadership. He expressed doubt about this rectification, saying that the result of the "Three Antis" was that "bureaucratism remained intact," and the result of the "New Three Antis" was that "bureaucratism was even more elevated." If we followed his logic, we could only draw the conclusion that to eliminate bureaucratism, we could only eliminate the Communist Party. He also summarized six major crimes for the Communist Party, saying that the Communist Party had "two faces, two practices, two laws," "considered itself a meritorious person, the masses dared not speak, and suggestions were often retaliated against," and that one hundred percent of the Communist Party members were factionalists, and so on. Yun Yinglin's fabrication of rumors and slander did not actually start today. According to revelations, as early as July of last year, after Yun Yinglin returned from an inspection of Hainan Island, which was being vigorously developed and hailed as a treasure island, he had wantonly slandered, saying that Hainan farmers "are all worried about poverty, and life is not easy to live." He said that Hainan fishermen were "sighing at the ocean." When he saw some fishermen wearing shirts printed with "Meritorious Service" and "Advanced Worker," he viciously said: "This is evidence of harming people." This shows his hostility towards the Party and socialism.

Regarding those actions of stirring up trouble, fabricating rumors, and viciously slandering, Yun Yinglin said it was to "create incidents." "Incidents" finally happened! But it was not what he expected, but the massive anti-rightist struggle of all the people. Yun Yinglin initially tried to quibble, saying that he could not stand firm, had the problem of exaggerating the shortcomings of the Communist Party, and also said that in the past 20 years, he had no contact with the reactionaries, had always followed the Communist Party, and had a history of emitting "fragrance."

But people all know that Yun Yinglin's anti-communism and anti-people stance has been consistent. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he served as the commander of the guerrilla column in Anhui Province of the Kuomintang, under the command of Li Pinxian, using resistance against Japan as a cover to fight against the Communist Party in reality. In 1945, Zhang Yan, a division commander of the 19th Route Army of the Kuomintang, intentionally wanted to cooperate with the Communist Party in Guangdong, but Yun Yinglin provoked Zhang Yan, saying: "When the Communist Party needs you, they will pull you in; when they don't need you, they will kick you away." This ultimately made Zhang waver. After the failure of the uprising, he was unwilling to enter the guerrilla area, which led to his tragic arrest and killing by Chiang Kai-shek. On the eve of the Huaihai Campaign in 1947, Zhang Bojun, Yun Yinglin, and some other figures of the third line also advocated engaging in armed forces independently, dreaming of "dividing the world into three parts." They organized the "China Democratic Action Committee" and the "Democratic National Salvation Army," and Yun was a general in this "National Salvation Army." In 1949, when Mei Rixin was engaged in peasant work in northern Panyu, Guangdong, Yun told him to organize the peasants into a detachment and put forward the request: "Fight against the Kuomintang when they come, and fight against the Communist Party when they come."

At the Guangdong Provincial People's Congress, the representatives pointed out that although Yun Yinglin had confessed to some problems, it was still far from a thorough confession. If he wanted to start anew, he had to continue to confess his guilt. However, Yun Yinglin not only did not repent at all, but also treated the people's warnings as a deaf ear. In just a few days, he dared to counterattack and continue to set fires and spread poison. He took the opportunity to slander Tao Zhu's resignation from the position of governor because the work was "messed up"; he praised Chen Zhuofan's stubborn attitude of refusing to confess at the People's Congress as "good"; he slandered the People's Congress for "forcing" him, saying that he had lost his "freedom" and only wrote a false self-criticism; he even slandered the entire anti-rightist struggle and the past "Three Antis" movement as forced confessions. For this reason, the Provincial Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party held a forum to continue to struggle against him, listing many conclusive facts, and he had to admit that it was not the People's Congress that "forced" him, admitting that he did have a cunning plan at the time: the self-criticism was a deliberate attempt to muddle through. In order to make this rightist element truly bow his head and confess his guilt to the people, the pursuit will continue.

    云应霖的丑恶活动是掩饰不住的
    本报记者　黄向青
    几个月来的事实说明了：顽抗、狡赖、且战且退、甚至伺机反噬，是农工民主党中委、广东省委会副主委、民盟省委、广东省人委会监察厅副厅长右派分子云应霖，在反右派斗争中的表现。
    这个右派分子过去的许多反党反人民的罪恶活动，经过农工党省委、监察厅全体干部以及不久前召开的省人代会进行了揭露批驳，他最初只承认自己是“单干的右派分子。”说什么由于名位思想发展到对党不满，只企图和共产党，“平起平坐，平分秋色，半斤八两，”“不是要推翻共产党。”但是，经过代表们进一步的揭发和斗争，他不得不后退一步，承认有一个右派集团，承认是“有一套阴谋从上面贯下来的，是有计划也有力量的”。
    这个右派分子集团的确很早就形成了。
    去年4月，章伯钧的干将杨逸棠、王一帆从北京相率南来，11月，李伯球也来了。他们都曾同农工民主党广东省委中的右派分子云应霖等进行过密商。
    据云应霖吐露：杨到广州曾约他到丘哲家里密谈，指示把打击梅日新（农工民主党广东省委委员）的问题，转变为对抗省委统战部，对抗共产党。李伯球对云等说：形势变了！许多方面都对共产党不满，将会发生大变化，赶紧把力量充实起来，到时才有搞头。
    今年云应霖在北京时，李伯球、杨逸棠还向他分析形势，说要闹大“民主”了，甚至农村里的地主也会起来了，要认真紧张开展工作，不能放松。李伯球还强调说：今后要紧密联系，会有很多任务交下来，要快些建立据点，巩固扩大集团，应付事变。
    就在这期间，广东省农工民主党内，包括云应霖、丘哲、李洁之、陈卓凡、廖嗣兰、杨飘棠、黄大锵等七个人的右派反党集团形成了。云应霖承认这个集团实际上是他抓起来的。为了企图摆脱共产党的领导，他们首先控制该党省委办公厅，并千方百计对靠拢共产党的进步分子进行打击排挤，安排自己人。云应霖曾说：“把农工党摆得这么后，是因为人少，本钱少。”因此他们就曾阴谋把省政协登记的四百多名社会知识分子接收过来，以壮大自己的声势。云应霖还准备和陈卓凡到全省各地活动，建立据点。
    整风开始后，云应霖这个右派先锋放马冲刺起来了。他挑拨是非，造谣诬蔑，猛放毒箭，大有恨不得跟共产党拼个死活不可之概。他对“党天下”的谬论表示赞同，他十分欣赏“共产党现在有一千二百万党员，也就是民主党派现在有一千二百万家婆”的胡说。而且，他在监察厅里就提出了取消机关党组的主张。早在去年7月，他在海南岛视察时就放起火来了，说：“人民政府没有民主，人民群众有话不敢说，各级党政的报告都是讲假话。”整风中又说：“各级人民委员会的会议，几乎没有什么讨论研究便通过决议案。”原来，早在中央提出“长期共存，互相监督”的方针时，他就强调“组织独立，政治自由”，强调不要领导的极端民主。他对这次整风表示怀疑，说“三反”的结果，是“官僚主义原封不动”，“新三反”的结果，是“官僚主义更加抬起头来”。如果按照他的说法，就只能得出这样的结论：要消除官僚主义，就只有消灭共产党了。他还为共产党归结了六大罪名，说什么共产党“两副脸孔、两种作法、两种法律”，“功臣自居，群众有话不敢讲，提意见常受报复打击”百分之一百的共产党员都是宗派主义等等。云应霖造谣诬蔑实际也不是从今天开始，据人揭发，早在去年7月云应霖在那正在大力建设开发的被誉为宝岛的海南岛视察回来以后，就曾经大肆诬蔑说：海南农民“人人正在忧贫，生活很不易过。”说海南渔民在“望洋兴叹。”他看见有些渔民穿着印有“功臣”“先进工作者”的衬衣时，竟恶毒地说：“这是害人的证据。”由此可见他对党对社会主义的敌视。
    对于那些挑拨是非，造谣污蔑的行动，云应霖说是为了“制造事变”。“事变”终于发生了！可不是他期待的，而是全体人民声势浩大的反右派斗争。云应霖初时曾在狡赖，说他是站不稳立场，有夸大共产党缺点的毛病，并且还说：他近二十年来，与反动派没有联系，一直跟共产党走，是发“香”的历史。
    但是人们都知道：云应霖反共反人民是一贯的。抗战时期，他任国民党安徽省游击纵队司令，受李品仙指挥，抗日为名，打共产党为实。1945年，国民党十九路军的一个师长张炎在广东有意要跟共产党合作，但云应霖挑拨张炎说：“共产党要你的时候，就拉你；不要你的时候，就踢开你。”终使张动摇起来，起义失败后也不愿进游击区，以致惨遭蒋介石捕杀。1947年淮海战役前夕，章伯钧、云应霖和另外一些第三条路线人物，还主张自己单独搞武装，梦想“三分天下”。他们组织“中华民主行动委员会”，“民主救国军”，云就是这个“救国军”的一名大将。1949年，梅日新在广东番禺北部搞农民工作，云叫他把农民编成一个支队，并提出要求说：“国民党来也打，共产党来也打。”
    在广东省人代会上，代表们曾指出：云应霖虽然交代了一些问题，但与彻底交代距离尚远。如果要从新做人，就要继续认罪交代。但是，云应霖不但毫不悔悟，而且把人民的警告当作耳边风。没有几天，他居然胆敢反噬、并且继续放火放毒。他乘机污蔑陶铸辞去省长职务是因为工作“搞糟了”；他赞扬陈卓凡在人代会上抗不交代的顽抗态度是“好样的”，他污蔑人代会“迫”他，说他失去“自由”，才写了假检讨；甚至污蔑整个反右派斗争和过去“三反”运动都是强迫交代的。为此，农工党省委召开了座谈会，继续对他展开斗争，列举了许多确确凿凿的事实，他才不得不承认并不是人代会“迫”他，承认他当时的确有一个狡猾的打算：检讨，是故弄玄虚企图滑过关去。为了使这个右派分子真正向人民低头伏罪，追击还将继续进行。
