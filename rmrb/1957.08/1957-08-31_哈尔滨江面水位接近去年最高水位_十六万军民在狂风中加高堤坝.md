Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, August 30th: As of 5:00 PM today, the water level of the river in the Harbin area had risen to 119.91 meters, exceeding the highest water level during the 1932 flood by 0.19 meters, and only 0.15 meters lower than the highest water level during last year's major flood. The water level is still continuing to rise.

Starting from midnight yesterday, Harbin City was again hit by gale force winds of level 7 and 8. The violent winds whipped up waves over two meters high, fiercely battering the 129-kilometer-long dike. Many dangerous situations, such as slope failures and dike body collapses, occurred on the dikes in the suburbs. After People's Liberation Army soldiers and commanders bravely waded into the water to block and rescue, all the dangers were averted. Two places on the city's dikes also experienced piping and seepage, but the workers' rescue teams fought in the cold water and stopped them by throwing in large amounts of stone. When the dikes were in imminent danger last night, Harbin City Mayor and Flood Prevention Commander-in-Chief Lü Qien and the Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee braved the wind and took a boat to inspect and guide the work on the dangerously urgent dikes.

Today, 160,000 soldiers and civilians in Harbin City continued to heighten and reinforce the dikes amidst the roaring wind and splashing waves. Another 15,000 rescue team members are stationed in their locations, awaiting orders. Trains loaded with earth directly reached the edge of the dikes to unload the soil, and the important dikes at various locations were quickly heightened.

　　哈尔滨江面水位接近去年最高水位
　　十六万军民在狂风中加高堤坝
    新华社哈尔滨30日电　今天下午五时，哈尔滨地区江面水位已经上升到一百一十九点九一公尺，超过1932年大水灾时的最高水位达零点一九公尺，比去年大洪水时的最高水位只差零点一五公尺。目前，水势仍在继续上涨。
    从昨天子夜起，哈尔滨市又遭受了七、八级大风袭击。狂风卷起二公尺多高的波浪，猛烈地冲击一百二十九公里长的堤坝。郊区大堤发生好多处脱坡和堤身塌陷等险象，经过人民解放军某部指战员奋不顾身地涉水堵救，都已经脱险。市区大堤也有两处发生管涌、渗水等险情，职工抢险队员在很凉的水中搏斗，投下大量石块后也堵住了。当昨夜堤坝告急的时候，哈尔滨市市长兼防汛总指挥吕其恩和中共市委书记等都冒着大风，乘船到险急的堤坝上巡回检查和指导。
    今天，哈尔滨市有十六万军民在狂风怒吼浪花四溅的堤坝上，继续加高加固堤坝。另有一万五千名抢险队员守在驻地，待命出动。一列列满载泥土的列车直达堤坝边卸下泥土后，各处险要堤坝迅速加高了。
