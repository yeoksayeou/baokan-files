New China Agricultural Cooperative of Gaochun County's Experimental Results:
    Five Major Benefits of Rationing Food by Person
    (Reported by this newspaper) The New China Agricultural Cooperative in Fengshan Township, Gaochun County, Jiangsu Province, achieved success in implementing a method of rationing food based on the number of people, alleviating the tension in food distribution.
    The New China Agricultural Cooperative is a surplus grain cooperative. However, in the past two years, there has been an uneven distribution of surplus and shortages among members, with needs not being met. Some households with many adults and strong labor found their grain insufficient, while households with fewer people and less labor had surplus grain. Some people used grain to feed pigs, while others even set up underground grain shops to engage in black market trading. The cooperative cadres were troubled by the food distribution problem, and active members within the cooperative requested improvements to the food ration method.
    In June of this year, the cooperative director, Song Changfu, in accordance with the directives of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on doing a good job in summer harvest distribution, proposed that the total amount of grain for the cooperative should not exceed the state's regulations. Different grain standards should be stipulated and distributed according to the age and labor strength of the cooperative members. This method was unanimously approved by the cooperative's management committee. After the management committee conducted publicity and explanation work among all members, the "rationing food by person" method was implemented in this summer grain distribution with the support of all members.
    As a result of the implementation of this method, the total grain required by the cooperative was more than 10,000 jin lower than the "three fix" (fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales) retention amount, which not only took care of the actual needs of the members but also allowed for more grain to be sold to the state. The cooperative's management committee summarized five major benefits of the "rationing food by person" distribution method: First, each member can receive enough grain according to reasonable needs, greatly reducing the number of households in overdraft. Cooperative member Song Changzhen's family of three has two main laborers. Last autumn, because of insufficient grain, they had to buy grain with money, owing the cooperative 14 yuan, which greatly affected their production enthusiasm. On the other hand, cooperative member Song Yongruo's family of six has only one laborer. Based on the standard of 480 jin, they retained enough grain. Last autumn's distribution not only did not result in cash, but they also owed the cooperative more than 50 yuan. After implementing the "rationing food by person" distribution method, this unreasonable overdraft phenomenon disappeared. Second, it alleviated the artificially created tension in the grain situation and improved the production enthusiasm of the members. For example, last year, 88 households with many adults in the cooperative protested to the cooperative about supplies after distribution. After implementing rationing by person, their grain ration increased by more than 16,000 jin compared to the "three fix" standard, and now everyone is working hard in production. Third, it blocked the grain black market and avoided the phenomenon of waste of grain by households with excessive grain distribution. Fourth, due to the reduction in overdraft households, it greatly saved the cooperative's production funds and the state's relief loans. The cooperative calculated that using the money saved from the reduced grain overdrafts to the members as production funds and investing it in reproduction can increase each member's income by 2.5 yuan. Fifth, it improved the relationship between cadres and the masses and increased the work confidence of the cooperative cadres. Cooperative Director Song Changfu said: In the past, when asking members to produce, some members would protest about supplies, asking for grain and money, making the work very difficult. Now, as long as the cooperative gives a call, the members will compete to do it, the work is easier, and there are fewer member complaints. (Zhen)

    高淳县新华农业社试验结果：
    以人定量有五大好处
    本报讯　江苏高淳县凤山乡新华农业社试行以人定量分配口粮办法获得成绩，缓和了粮食分配的紧张现象。
    新华农业社是一个余粮社，但是，近两年以来，社员中出现了余缺不均，需求不相适应的情况，有些大人多、劳力强的户，粮食不够吃，而人多劳力少的户，口粮有余。有的人拿粮食喂猪，有的人还开设地下粮行，进行黑市买卖。社干部为粮食分配问题感到苦恼，社内积极分子都有改进口粮分配办法的要求。
    今年6月，社主任宋昌富根据中共中央和国务院关于做好夏收分配工作的指示精神，提出全社口粮总量不超过国家规定，按照社员年龄大小、劳力强弱，规定不同的口粮标准进行分配的办法。这个办法得到社务委员会的一致同意。经过管委会向全体社员进行了宣传解释工作，得到全体社员的拥护，“以人定量”的办法便在这次夏粮分配中实行了。
    这个办法实行的结果，全社合计需粮数比“三定”留量要低一万多斤粮食，既照顾到社员的实际需要，又可以多卖粮食给国家。社务管理委员会总结出“以人定量”分配办法有五大好处：第一，每个社员都能按照合理需要，分到足够的口粮，大大减少了透支户。社员宋昌珍，全家三口，有两个主要劳动力。去年秋天因粮食不够，要拿钱买粮吃，欠社里十四元钱，生产情绪很受影响。而社员宋永若全家六口，只有一个劳动力，按四百八十斤标准留足口粮，去年秋收分配不但没有分到现金，还欠了社里五十多元。实行“以人定量”分配办法以后，这种不合理的透支现象就没有了。第二，缓和了粮食人为紧张的情况，提高了社员的生产积极性。如去年全社有八十八户大人多的社员，分配后，向社里闹供应。实行以人定量后，他们的口粮比“三定”标准增加了一万六千多斤，现在生产个个起劲。第三，堵塞了粮食黑市市场，避免了分粮过多户浪费粮食的现象。第四，由于透支户减少，大大节省了社里的生产资金和国家的救济贷款。社里算了一笔账，把少透支给社员的粮钱作为生产资金，投入再生产，每个社员可增加收入二元五角。第五，改善了干部群众的关系，提高了社干部的工作信心。社主任宋昌富说：以前要社员生产，有的社员就闹供应，要粮要钱，工作很吃力。现在只要社里一声号召，社员就争着去干，工作好做了，社员意见也少了。　（甄）
