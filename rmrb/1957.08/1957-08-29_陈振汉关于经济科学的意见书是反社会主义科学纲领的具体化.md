Chen believes that the Party fundamentally does not understand economic laws; that Marxist-Leninist economics is outdated and that bourgeois economics must be restored, allowing bourgeois economists to participate in decision-making.

(Reported by this newspaper) In the anti-rightist struggle in economic circles, it was discovered that Chen Zhenhan, professor at Peking University and deputy director of the Peking University branch of the China Democratic League, was an important figure in the Zhang-Luo alliance's anti-communist and anti-socialist activities in economic circles. During the peak of the Zhang-Luo group's reactionary activities in May and June, Chen Zhenhan, following the instructions of the Zhang-Luo group, summoned Xu Yuzhan, Luo Zhiru, both professors at Peking University, Wu Baosan, deputy director of the Institute of Economics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Ning Jiafeng, vice president of the Cadre School of the People's Bank of China, Gu Chunfan, deputy minister of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, and others to secretly meet twice at his home and Wu Baosan's home to discuss issues such as the so-called "current situation of economics and future development direction," and drafted an anti-communist, anti-socialist, and anti-Marxist "Our Opinions on Current Economic Science Work." This opinion paper was an integral part of the Zhang-Luo group's political conspiracy. It embodied the main arguments of the anti-communist and anti-socialist scientific program formulated by the Zhang-Luo group, concretized it from the perspective of national economic work and economics, and elaborated on it in some places. Before holding the symposium, Chen Zhenhan discussed it with Chu Anping, preparing to publish this vicious "opinion" attacking the Party in the Guangming Daily. Around June 20th, just as the anti-rightist struggle was fiercely underway and Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" was published, this rightist element had not abandoned his ambition to attack the Party and was still circulating and discussing it. It was only because of the further deepening of the anti-rightist struggle that this programmatic "opinion" was not published.

This anti-Party and anti-socialist opinion paper first made a dark portrayal of the current situation of socialist economic construction in our country and launched a fierce attack and slander against the Party's leadership of financial and economic work. Ignoring the great achievements of our country's economic construction, they instead believed that the current practice of our country's economic construction was in a state of crisis, saying, "Our work is not without errors, even serious errors, and there are often deviations, often large deviations." They slandered that the reason for these "serious errors" and "large deviations" was that the comrades leading financial and economic work had no economic common sense, even being ignorant of such ordinary common sense as "if the state's financial revenue and expenditure cannot be balanced, it will lead to price increases and tight supply of materials," "failed to grasp or fundamentally did not know that there should be objective economic laws," relying solely on their own experience to lead work and looking down on the role of economic science. They said, "Many of our financial and economic policies and facilities blindly copied Soviet examples, that is, experimenting with errors, trial and error, subjectivism, and blind action, without following any objective economic laws, and not knowing what laws are available for reference." And thus concluded: "Our financial and economic policies are inevitably too blind, and our financial and economic work is inevitably too childish."

After making a reckless attack on financial and economic policies and economic work, the opinion paper then wantonly vilified Marxist-Leninist political economics. They regarded Marxism-Leninism as dogmatism, believing that Marxism-Leninism was outdated, and that some basic principles discovered by the founders of Marxism-Leninism were only applicable to certain historical periods and were no longer applicable now. They also believed that Marxist-Leninist economic science could only guide the practice of class struggle, without revealing universally applicable laws to guide the practice of socialist economic construction, so it was also useless for our country's economic construction practice. The author of the opinion paper wrote: "Regarding socialist construction, we cannot find ready-made and universally applicable laws in the works of Marxist-Leninist classic writers, especially because Marxist-Leninist classic writers did not prescribe a set of universally applicable plans for socialist economic construction in various countries." And said: "Many classic works were written a hundred years ago, and can only foresee the general outline of things in the past century, but cannot discern the details." "Many of Marx's works were published after his death, so how can we guarantee that every word is a pearl?" Then they shouted loudly: "Discard what is worn out!" Regarding the current situation of Marxist-Leninist economic science research in our country, they also dismissed its role and achievements, believing that: "Current economic science has not played a role in guiding practice. In fact, our current economic science is still stuck in a rather immature stage, except for the dogmatic transportation of some things from Soviet textbooks, there are only descriptions of current systems." Also said: "The situation of economic science in our country cannot be said to have progressed much since Chairman Mao criticized economists in 1942 for being unable to solve the problem of border currency." They believed that dogmatism was rampant in economic circles, regarding every word in classic works as golden rules and jade laws, and rote repetition and recitation became a common practice, "most economists only publicize and explain policies for the government," only "annotate a certain book or article or play with other concepts or words," only "make some quotations," "even mistakes in manual typesetting or errors in translation and awkward translations are regarded with reverence and the spiritual essence is experienced there."

As for the use of Marxist-Leninist political economics, they believed that it only cultivated some teaching and propaganda personnel. As early as after the Party put forward the call to march towards science, Chen Zhenhan chanted the tune of Marxist-Leninist "uselessness of social science," which was fully implemented in the opinion paper and received concrete development. At their symposium, Chen Zhenhan even openly stated that Marxist-Leninist political economics was not a science at all, advocating that it be abolished. He said: "Now political economics is not commensurate as a discipline, and even as a pure discipline, it does not seem to have any scientific value, it does not teach the science we understood before. Science always explains cause and effect, but now it is just some quotations. Laws should be the relationship between the two, but now laws are just Stalin's quotations." This vicious attack was similarly infiltrated into the opinion paper in a piecemeal manner.

As for why economic research in our country, as they said, "became a prisoner of dogmatism" and "did not find the correct direction of development"? They took the opportunity to accuse the Party of extremely serious sectarianism, and according to them, dogmatism was not terrible, sectarianism was not terrible, what was more terrible was the dogmatism of sectarianism, the sectarianism of dogmatism, the Party committed both, so that economic science research fell into a predicament and could not find the right path. They wantonly provoked the relationship between the Party and the masses, provoked the relationship between Party and non-Party economists, slandered that the Party did not attach importance to economic science work, and regarded "economic science work as a burden and burden, and regarded itself as a giver or even a master." Saying that the Party "does not understand the expertise of non-Party economists," therefore "cannot have sincere respect for them," and even adopts "political discrimination" towards their "scientific academic views," and has "different evaluations" of their "scientific achievements." They also said that in the allocation of work, the opportunities for "non-Party colleagues" and "Party comrades" are not equal, and "the teaching and research work of political economics is mainly regarded as the forbidden fruit of Party members or a few non-Party activists, and is carried out by Party comrades, and ordinary non-Party economists have no way to intervene or can only use economic thought history, economic history, or the economy of capitalist countries, etc. as a place to settle down." Even more viciously, they went on to distort and slander the Party's policy of ideological remolding of intellectuals, saying that "in the past, we were placed in a position where we could not contact reality, and were placed in a position where we could not but be dogmatic," falsely accusing the Party of cultivating them into dogmatists. The true intention of these reactionary howls is to demand that the Party abolish the theoretical standards of Marxism and the political standards of the proletariat, and abolish "political discrimination" for the "scientific academic views" of the bourgeoisie, and adopt an equal policy.

According to the description of this opinion paper, since Marxism-Leninism is equivalent to dogmatism, Marxist-Leninist economics is outdated and useless, and our country's economic construction practice is a mess, then what is the direction of development of economic science? What does economic construction practice rely on for guidance? The author of the opinion paper made a coy answer to this, but finally revealed his wolfish ambitions as a bourgeois rightist. The opinion paper put forward the specific requirements for the restoration of bourgeois economics, on the one hand, it clamored to "abandon" the "worn-out shoes" of Marxism, on the other hand, it emphasized that it is necessary to "absorb" and "utilize" the useful concepts or methods of bourgeois economics. And taking Keynes' "multiplier theory" and the "marginal concept" in vulgar economics and bourgeois statistics as examples, saying that these things are useful to us. The opinion paper asked in a provocative tone: "Is the bourgeois economics in the period of the general crisis of capitalism all nonsense, and there is nothing to take, and has there been great development that can be critically absorbed and utilized by us?" Then it accused us of "not understanding some things and not understanding them or not contacting them, but if they are bourgeois, they have a sense of panic," and dismissed them with one stroke. The author of the opinion paper implicitly but substantially put forward the proposition of replacing Marxist political economics with Keynesian economics, and replacing Marx's labor theory of value with the marginal utility theory of vulgar economics, demanding that we abolish the class nature of economics and let bourgeois economics reoccupy the leading position.

Under the guise of providing preconditions for carrying out economic research, this opinion paper also revealed the naked political ambitions of rightist elements such as Chen Zhenhan. They attempted to get involved in the decision-making work of financial and economic policies, guide economic policies and national construction work with bourgeois economic theories, and pave the way for the restoration of the capitalist system. The so-called conditions for scientific work required in the "opinion paper" are to first let them "have more opportunities to contact reality," that is, to combine their set of "economic science" with "practical economic work," so that "some theoretical principles related to policies and principles are handed over to economic science workers to solve, or solicit their opinions before decisions are made on policies and principles, let them participate in discussions, that is, open up a wide range of opinions on policies and principles, and take the mass line more." Secondly, they demanded that the scope of confidentiality be minimized and that they be provided with information and convenience. They proposed that even the figures for currency issuance do not need to be kept confidential, and incited that our confidentiality of the figures for currency issuance is to cover up the fiscal deficit and cover up the shortcomings in our work. They demanded that "it be made public so that everyone can understand the situation and supervise the government." However, their demands are not limited to this, in the following sentence, their fox tails are finally revealed, they said, "What we demand is not only to obtain more 'internal information,' but to hope for more openness, which is also one of the important ways to expand democracy." From this, it is not difficult to see that what they demand to contact reality and relax the scope of confidentiality is not for scientific research, but for them to be able to participate in formulating policies, abolishing the dictatorship of the proletariat, and "expanding democracy." Zhang Bojun's "political design institute" was thus concretized in this programmatic "opinion."

    陈振汉关于经济科学的意见书是反社会主义科学纲领的具体化
    他认为：党根本不懂经济规律；马列主义经济学已经过时了，必须让资产阶级经济学复辟，让资产阶级经济学家参预决策工作。
    本报讯　在经济学界的反右派斗争中，查出北京大学教授、民盟北京大学支部副主任委员陈振汉是章罗联盟在经济学界进行反共反社会主义活动的一个重要头目。陈振汉在5、6月间章罗集团反动活动达到高峰的时候，听从章罗集团的指使，召集北京大学教授徐毓枬、罗志如、中国科学院经济研究所副所长巫宝三、中国人民银行总行干部学校副校长宁嘉风、邮电部副部长谷春帆等人，在他家和巫宝三家中先后秘密集会两次，座谈所谓
  “经济学的现状及今后发展方向”等问题，并于会后草成了一份反共反社会主义和反马克思主义的“我们对于当前经济科学工作的一些意见”。这个意见书是章罗集团政治阴谋的一个组成部分。它体现了章罗集团制订的反共反社会主义的科学纲领的主要论点，从国家经济工作和经济学方面加以具体化，有些地方并作了申论和发挥。陈振汉在开座谈会之前就和储安平商量过，准备把这一向党进攻的恶毒的“意见”发表在光明日报上。6月20日左右，正当反右派斗争炽热开展、毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”发表后，这个右派分子还没有放弃向党进攻的野心，仍然在传阅讨论，只是由于反右派斗争进一步的深入开展，这个纲领性的“意见”才没有发表。
    这一反党反社会主义的意见书，首先对于我国社会主义经济建设的现状，作了阴暗的描绘，对于党对财经工作的领导，进行了凶恶的攻击和污蔑。他们无视我国经济建设的伟大成就，反而认为目前我国的经济建设的实践正处在危机的阶段中，说什么“我们的工作中并非没有错误，甚至是严重的错误，也并非不出偏差，往往是幅度很大的偏差。”其所以会造成这种“严重的错误”和“幅度很大的偏差”，他们污蔑地说，这是因为领导财经工作的同志毫无经济常识，甚至连
  “国家财政收支如果不能平衡势将导致物价的上涨和物资供应的紧张状态”这样极普通的常识都不知道，“没有能够掌握或根本不知道应当有客观经济规律”，好凭一己经验领导工作，看不起经济科学的作用。他们说“我们的财经政策和设施，不少是盲目地搬用苏联成例，即是试验错误，碰碰试试，主观主义，盲目行事，并未遵循什么客观经济规律，也不知道有什么规律可资遵循。”并因而得出结论说：“我们的财经政策未免过于盲目了，我们的财经工作也未免太儿戏了。”
    意见书对财经政策和经济工作作了狂妄地攻击之后，接着对马列主义政治经济学横加诋毁。他们把马列主义看作教条主义，认为马列主义已经过时了，马列主义创始人所发现的一些基本原理只适用于一定的历史时期，现在很多已不适用了。并认为马克思列宁主义的经济科学，只能指导阶级斗争的实践，没有揭示指导社会主义经济建设实践的放之四海而皆准的规律，所以它对于我国的经济建设实践也是没有用处的。意见书的作者写道：“关于社会主义建设，我们不能从马列主义的经典作家的著作中找到现成的和四海皆准的规律，特别是因为马列主义的经典作家没有为各国的社会主义经济建设规定一套放之四海而皆准的方案”。并说：“许多经典著作写作于百年以前，对于百年来的事物只能预见其大，不能洞烛几微。”“马克思的许多著作都是出版于身后，又怎能必其字字珠玉呢？”接着便大声疾呼的喊叫：“是敝履就要摒弃”！关于我国目前的马列主义经济科学研究情况，他们同样一笔抹煞其作用和成就，认为：“目前的经济科学并没有起到指导实践的作用。事实上我们目前的经济科学还是停滞在相当幼稚的阶段，除了教条的搬运苏联教科书的一些东西而外，就是一些现行制度的描述”。又说：“我国的经济科学的情况，不能说比毛主席在1942年批评经济学家不能解决边币的情形前进了多少”。他们认为，教条主义严重地泛滥于经济学界，奉经典著作上的一字一句为金科玉律，照本转述背诵成风，“多数经济学家只是替政府宣传解释政策”，只是“做做某书某文的签注或其它概念或文字游戏”，只是“作些语录”，“甚至连对手民排校的错误或翻译上的错误和诘屈聱牙的译文也神而敬之的在那里体会精神实质”。
    至于马列主义政治经济学的用处，他们认为，只是培养出一些教学宣传人员。早在党提出向科学进军的号召之后，陈振汉就高唱马列主义“社会科学无用论”的调子，这个调子充分贯彻在意见书中，并得到了具体的发挥。陈振汉在他们的座谈会上，更公然提出马列主义政治经济学根本不是一门科学，主张加以取消。他说：“现在政治经济学作为一门学问不相称，即使作为一门纯粹的学问也不像有什么科学价值的东西，教的不是我们从前所了解的科学。科学总是说明因果关系的，而现在只是些语录。规律应为二者之间的关系，而现在规律只是斯大林的语录。”这种恶毒的攻击，同样是以化整为零的方式渗透在意见书中的。
    至于我国经济学的研究工作，何以如他们所说“成了教条主义的俘虏”，何以“没有找到正确的发展方向”呢？他们就借题加给党以宗派主义十分严重的罪名，而且据他们所说，教条主义不可怕，宗派主义也不可怕，更可怕的是宗派主义的教条主义，教条主义的宗派主义，党是二者兼犯，以致使经济科学的研究工作陷入困境，找不到正路。他们放肆地挑拨党群关系，挑拨党与非党经济学家之间的关系，污蔑党不重视经济科学工作，把“经济科学工作始终看作是包袱和负担，而自己以施与者甚至主宰者自居”。说党“不了解党外经济学人的专长”，因而“对他们不能有衷心的尊重”，甚至“对于党外经济学人的科学学术见解”采取
  “政治歧视”，对他们的“科学成就”有“不同的估价”。他们还说，在分配工作上“党外的同行”和“党内同志”的机会不均等，“政治经济学的教学和研究工作主要还视为党内或少数党外积极分子的禁脔，由党内同志进行，一般党外经济学人无从插足或只能以经济思想史、经济史或资本主义国家的经济等博古通今的工作为安身立命之所”。更其恶毒的是，他们进而歪曲和污蔑党对知识分子思想改造的政策，说什么“过去我们是被放在一种不能接触实际的地位上，被放在一种不能不教条的地位上”，诬指党把他们培养成了教条主义者。他们这些反动叫嚣的真实意图，就是要求党取消马克思主义的理论标准和无产阶级的政治标准，对于资产阶级的“科学学术见解”取消“政治歧视”，采取一视同仁的政策。
    按照这个意见书的描述，既然马列主义等同于教条主义，马列主义经济学过时了，无用了，我国的经济建设实践又一团糟，那末经济科学的发展方向何在呢？经济建设实践依靠什么东西来指导呢？意见书的作者对此忸怩作态的作了解答，但也终于露出了他的资产阶级右派分子的狼子野心。意见书提出了资产阶级经济学复辟的具体要求，它一方面叫嚣要“摒弃”马克思主义的“敝履”，另一方面强调提出要“吸收”和“利用”资产阶级经济学的有用的概念或方法。并以凯恩斯的“乘数论”和庸俗经济学中的“边际观念”和资产阶级统计学等为例，说这些东西对我们都是有用的。意见书以挑衅的口吻反问道：“资本主义总危机时期的资产阶级经济学是否全篇胡说八道，一无可取，是否也有了很大的发展，可供我们批判地吸收和利用呢？”接着便指责我们“对有些东西不懂并不了解也没接触但要是资产阶级的便有草木皆兵之感”，而一笔抹煞。意见书的作者隐约地但实质上是提出了以凯恩斯经济学代替马克思主义政治经济学，以庸俗经济学的边际效用论代替马克思的劳动价值论的主张，要求我们取消经济学的阶级性，让资产阶级经济学重新占据领导地位。
    在为开展经济学研究提供前提的幌子下，这个意见书还透露了右派分子陈振汉等的露骨的政治野心。他们企图染指于财经政策的决策工作，以资产阶级经济学说指导经济政策和国家建设工作，为资本主义制度的复辟开辟道路。他们在“意见书”中要求的所谓科学工作的条件，是首先让他们“多有接触实际的机会”，即让他们的一套“经济科学”和“实际经济工作结合起来”，以便“一些有关方针政策的理论原则问题交给经济科学工作者去解决，或者在方针政策决定之前征求他们的意见，让他们参预讨论，也就是在方针政策上广开言路，多走群众路线”。其次，他们要求把保密范围尽量缩小，向他们提供资料和便利。他们提出，甚至货币发行数字都没有保密的必要，并煽惑地说我们对货币发行数字保密，目的是为了掩盖财政赤字，掩盖工作中的缺点。他们要求“公开出来，让大家了解情况，对政府进行监督”。然而，他们的要求不止于此，在下面一句话里，终于露出了他们的狐狸尾巴，他们说，“我们所要求的还不止于多获得一些‘内部资料’，而是希望有更多的公开性，这也是扩大民主的重要方式之一。”由此就不难看出，他们所要求的接触实际和放宽保密范围，并不是为了科学研究，而是为了他们能够参预制订政策，取消无产阶级专政，“扩大民主”。章伯钧的“政治设计院”于是在这个纲领性的“意见”里得到了具体化。
