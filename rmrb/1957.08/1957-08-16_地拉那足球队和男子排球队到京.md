Xinhua News Agency, August 15th: The Albanian sports team, the Tirana Football Team and the Tirana Men's Volleyball Team, numbering thirty-four, arrived in Beijing by plane today for their first visit to China. The Tirana Football Team and Volleyball Team are visiting at the invitation after participating in the Third International Youth Friendship Games. They will travel separately to Shenyang, Shanghai and other places for visits and competitions in the coming days.

The Tirana Football Team is led by Kiço Karaguni, Director of the Sports Administration Department of the Ministry of Health of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Albania. The leader of the Tirana Men's Volleyball Team is Enver Maçi. They were warmly welcomed at the airport by Cai Shufan, Deputy Director of the Sports Commission, Zhang Qingji, Director of the Beijing Municipal Sports Commission, and Chinese athletes. The Tirana Football Team coach will arrive in Beijing on the 16th.

At the Third International Youth Friendship Games, the Tirana Football Team and the Shanghai Football Team of China were placed in different groups, so the two teams did not play each other in Moscow. However, when the Beijing Institute of Physical Education football team visited Albania last November, they lost to the team twice, with scores of 1-5 and 1-4.

The Tirana Men's Volleyball Team played against the Chinese Youth Men's Volleyball Team at the Third International Youth Friendship Games, with the Chinese team winning 3-0.

    地拉那足球队和男子排球队到京
    据新华社15日讯  第一次来中国访问的阿尔巴尼亚的体育运动队——地拉那足球队和地拉那男子排球队一行三十四人，今天乘飞机到达北京。地拉那足球队和排球队是参加了第三届国际青年友谊运动会后应邀来这里的。他们将在日内分头先去沈阳和上海等地访问比赛。
    地拉那足球队由阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国部长会议卫生部体育运动管理局局长基乔·卡拉古尼率领。地拉那男子排球队的领队是恩维尔·马奇。他们在机场上受到体育运动委员会副主任蔡树藩，北京市体育运动委员会主任张青季和中国运动员们的热烈欢迎。地拉那足球队指导将在16日到达北京。
    在第三届国际青年友谊运动会上，地拉那足球队同中国的上海足球队被分在不同的组内，因此这两个队在莫斯科没有举行过比赛。但是，去年11月间北京体育学院足球队去阿尔巴尼亚访问比赛时，曾以一比五和一比四两次输给对方。
    地拉那男子排球队在第三届国际青年友谊运动会上，曾经同中国青年男子排球队举行过比赛，中国队以三比零获胜。
