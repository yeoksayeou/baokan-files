Xinhua News Agency, August 14th: Another new comet has been discovered this year. On the evening of August 12th, at 8:30 PM, staff at the Beijing Planetarium accidentally spotted a new comet with the naked eye in the northwest sky, below the Big Dipper (Ursa Major). Its luminosity was bright (magnitude of a second-magnitude star), and its bright nucleus (the head of the comet) and a long tail were visible. The planetarium immediately used a telescope to observe it, confirming that it was a new comet.

    In the recent period, on any clear night, people across China can see this comet with the naked eye.

    On August 2nd, Czechoslovakian astronomer Mrkos first discovered this comet. He immediately notified the International Astronomical Center in Copenhagen, Denmark. This new comet was then named Comet Mrkos.

    Experts at the Beijing Planetarium explained the comet situation to reporters, saying that the appearance of a new comet is not a peculiar astronomical phenomenon. Several new comets appear every year, but most comets can only be seen with astronomical telescopes, and only a few can be seen with the naked eye. The Chinese people have traditionally referred to comets as "broom stars." In the past, some people with superstitious ideas regarded broom stars as ominous omens, which is completely without scientific basis. Most of a comet is composed of rarefied gas. When it approaches the sun, it is subjected to the pressure of sunlight, and the gas in the comet is pushed to the rear, becoming the tail of the comet. Therefore, the tail of a comet always points away from the sun, and the farther it is from the sun, the shorter the comet's tail becomes.

### 今年又发现一颗新彗星

    今年又发现一颗新彗星
    据新华社14日讯　今年又一颗新彗星被发现。8月12日晚上八时半，北京天文馆工作人员偶然用肉眼看到天空的西北部北斗七星（大熊星座）下方有一颗新彗星，它的光度轻亮（二等星光度），可以看到它的明亮的彗核（彗星的头）和一个长尾巴。天文馆当即用天文望远镜观测，证明是一颗新的彗星。
    在最近一个时期内，凡是晴天的夜晚，我国各地人民都可以用肉眼看到这颗彗星。
    8月2日，捷克斯洛伐克天文学家姆尔科斯最先发现这颗彗星。他立刻通知了设在丹麦哥本哈根的国际天文中心。这颗新彗星便被命名为姆尔科斯彗星。
    北京天文馆的专家向记者解释彗星情况时说，新彗星的出现并不是奇特的天文现象，每年总会有若干颗新彗星出现，只是大多数彗星只能用天文望远镜才能看到，能凭肉眼看到的只是少数。我国人民一向把彗星俗称“扫帚星”，过去有些有迷信思想的人们把扫帚星看成是不祥之兆，这是毫无科学根据的。彗星的大部分是由稀薄气体组成的，当它接近太阳时，受到太阳光的压力，彗星中的气体就被推向后面，成为彗星的尾巴，所以彗星的尾巴总是背着太阳，而且越离太阳远彗星的尾巴就越短。
