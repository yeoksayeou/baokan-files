Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 9th: The International Preparatory Meeting of the Third World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament continued today in four groups, engaging in in-depth discussions on issues related to the prohibition of nuclear weapons and disarmament.

    At a meeting of the international law and disarmament experts group this morning, Honda Ryosuke, a representative of the International Organization of Journalists, reported on the London Disarmament Conference. He said that the issue of banning nuclear weapons testing is of greatest concern to peace-loving people at present, but the United States insists on mixing the issue of banning nuclear weapons testing with other issues in order to obstruct the reaching of an international agreement on halting nuclear weapons testing. He also pointed out that the US proposal to temporarily suspend testing for ten months cannot solve the problem. He believes that nuclear weapons testing must be unconditionally and permanently banned, or at least suspended for three years. He also advocated that the cessation of nuclear weapons testing should be resolved separately from other issues. Finally, when talking about the disarmament mechanism, he advocated that the People's Republic of China should participate in the disarmament mechanism.

    Kameyama, Chairman of the Okinawa Prefecture Compatriots Association, said at the meeting that the San Francisco Peace Treaty has been in effect for five years, but the United States still occupies Okinawa, doesn't this violate international law? He then accused the US military of expanding bases and killing residents on Okinawa, and accused the United States of attempting to permanently occupy Okinawa. He hoped that everyone would help liberate Okinawa from American military rule.

    At a meeting of the radionuclide scientists group this morning, British representative and physicist Rotblat strongly criticized the US assertion that "clean hydrogen bombs" can be manufactured. He said that from the standpoint of scientists, this is a deceptive trick.

Xinhua News Agency, August 9th: Nagasaki News: The people of Nagasaki City, Japan, today issued a "Peace Declaration" calling for the prohibition of nuclear weapons and the realization of lasting peace to commemorate the twelfth anniversary of their city being bombed by the US atomic bomb.

    At 10:50 a.m. today, approximately two thousand citizens from all walks of life in Nagasaki City gathered in Peace Park in the central area of ​​the city that was bombed by the atomic bomb, to hold a memorial service for the victims of the atomic bomb and pray for peace. Indian representatives attending the Third World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament also participated in the ceremony. At 11:02 a.m. – the moment Nagasaki City was bombed by the US atomic bomb twelve years ago, the bells of churches and temples throughout the city rang together, and factories and ships also sounded their whistles at the same time. 220,000 citizens were silent to mourn the more than 70,000 atomic bomb victims.

    Subsequently, Nagasaki Mayor Tagawa delivered a "Peace Declaration" on behalf of the people of the city. The "Peace Declaration" said that the people of Nagasaki City, who have suffered the tragic baptism of the atomic bomb, call on the people of the world to strive for the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bombs in order to seek true world peace and human love. The declaration also stated that we, the people of Nagasaki City, are determined to redouble our efforts to achieve lasting world peace through reconciliation and trust.

    This afternoon, approximately five thousand people from all walks of life in Nagasaki City held a conference against atomic and hydrogen bombs in Peace Park.

    日本代表在禁止氢弹世界大会上
    指斥美国阻挠协议停止核试验
    长崎人民集会追悼原子弹牺牲者
    据新华社东京9日电　第三届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会国际预备会议今天继续分成四个小组，深入讨论有关禁止核武器和裁军的问题。
    在国际法与裁军专家小组今天上午举行的会议上，国际新闻工作者协会的代表本田良介就伦敦裁军会议问题作了报告。他说，目前爱好和平的人民最关心禁止核武器的试验问题，但是美国主张把禁止核武器试验问题和其他问题混在一起解决，以阻挠就停止核武器试验达成国际协议。他还指出，美国主张暂时停止试验十个月是不能解决问题的。他认为必须无条件地永远禁止核武器的试验，至少也要停止试验三年。他还主张把停止核武器试验同其他问题分开来解决。最后，他在谈到裁军机构问题时，主张应该让中华人民共和国参加裁军机构。
    冲绳县同乡会会长龟山在会上说，旧金山和约生效已经五年，但是美国还占领着冲绳岛，这难道不违反国际法吗？他接着控诉了美军在冲绳岛扩充基地与杀害居民的罪行，并且指责美国企图永久占领冲绳岛。他希望大家协助把冲绳岛从美国的军事统治下解救出来。
    在放射能科学家小组今天上午举行的会议上，英国代表、物理学家罗特布拉特在发言中着重指责了美国提出的能够制造“干净的氢弹”的说法。他说，从科学家的立场来看，这是骗人的鬼话。
    新华社9日讯　长崎消息：日本长崎市人民今天发表了一项“和平宣言”，呼吁禁止核武器和实现持久和平，来纪念他们的城市遭受美国原子弹轰炸十二周年。
    今天上午十时五十分，长崎市各阶层市民共约两千人集合在这个城市遭受原子弹轰炸的中心区的和平公园里，举行了追悼原子弹牺牲者和祈求和平的仪式。出席第三届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会的印度代表们也参加了这个仪式。十一点零二分——长崎市在十二年前遭受美国原子弹轰炸的时刻，全市教堂、庙宇的钟声齐鸣，工厂、轮船也同时鸣起汽笛，二十二万市民一齐静默，向七万多名原子弹牺牲者表示哀悼。
    接着，长崎市市长田川代表全市人民发表了“和平宣言”。“和平宣言”说，遭受了原子弹的悲惨的洗礼的长崎市人民，为了寻求真正的世界和平和人类爱，呼吁全世界人民努力争取禁止原子弹和氢弹。宣言并且说，我们长崎市人民决心要加倍努力，通过和解和信赖来实现持久的世界和平。
    今天下午，长崎市各阶层人民共约五千人又在和平公园里举行了禁止原子弹氢弹大会。
    为了追悼被美国原子弹杀害的亲人们，长崎市民在晚间还要在河里放河灯。
