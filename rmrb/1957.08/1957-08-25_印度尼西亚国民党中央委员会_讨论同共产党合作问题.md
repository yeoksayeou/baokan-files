　　Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 24th: The Central Committee of the Indonesian Nationalist Party held a plenary session on the morning of August 23rd to discuss the issue of cooperation between the Nationalist Party and the Indonesian Communist Party and other political parties.

　　This meeting was considered very important. Almost all members of the Nationalist Party Central Committee, as well as Nationalist Party members serving as cabinet ministers, members of parliament, and members of the Constitutional Assembly, attended the meeting. The meeting was presided over by Suwirjo, Chairman of the Nationalist Party.

　　The issue of the relationship between the Nationalist Party and the Indonesian Communist Party became prominent after the local council elections in Java. Some members of the Nationalist Party believe that the Nationalist Party suffered a defeat in the local elections because it was disadvantaged by cooperating with the Indonesian Communist Party. Therefore, they took this opportunity to propose reconsidering the cooperative relationship with the Indonesian Communist Party. Other members of the Nationalist Party believe that the reasons for the election failure should be sought in the shortcomings of the Nationalist Party itself, and should not be attributed to "Nationalist-Communist cooperation."

　　As previously reported, the Indonesian Communist Party has repeatedly expressed its hope to continue cooperation with the Nationalist Party, while the Masyumi Party and the Socialist Party are trying to divide the relationship between the Nationalist Party and the Communist Party. It is believed here that the Nationalist Party is facing an important choice.

　　印度尼西亚国民党中央委员会
　　讨论同共产党合作问题
    据新华社雅加达24日电　印度尼西亚国民党中央委员会在8月23日上午举行全体会议，讨论了国民党同印度尼西亚共产党和其他政党的合作问题。
    这次会议被认为很重要。几乎全体国民党中央委员以及担任内阁部长、国会议员和制宪议会议员的国民党员都出席了会议。会议由国民党总主席苏维约主持。
    国民党同印度尼西亚共产党的关系问题是在爪哇地方议会选举以后明显地提出来的。一部分国民党人士认为，国民党在地方选举中遭受失败是因为吃了同印度尼西亚共产党合作的亏，因此趁这个机会提出要重新考虑和印度尼西亚共产党的合作关系问题。国民党的另一部分人士认为，应该从国民党本身的缺点中去寻找选举失败的原因，而不能把它归咎于“国共合作”。
    前已报道，印度尼西亚共产党曾经屡次表示希望同国民党继续合作，而马斯友美党和社会党则在极力分裂国民党和共产党的关系。此间人士认为，国民党正在面临着一个重要的抉择。
