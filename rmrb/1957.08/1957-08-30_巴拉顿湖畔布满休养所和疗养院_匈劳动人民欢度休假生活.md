Budapest, August 28th - The Hungarian Trade Union Federation has made great efforts to ensure that more workers can enjoy preferential summer vacations. Last summer, 180,000 workers enjoyed the preferential treatment of the Trade Union Federation for vacations. According to the original plan of the Trade Union Federation for 1957, 200,000 workers would go on vacation this summer, but the October counter-revolutionary events disrupted this plan and directly affected the welfare of workers. As of November last year, the trade union no longer had the financial capacity to guarantee the summer vacation life of workers. Thanks to the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries in politics and economy, and the efforts of the Hungarian working people, Hungary's economic life has recovered rapidly. Unexpectedly, the number of workers enjoying trade union vacation benefits this year is only 20,000 fewer than last year. The Trade Union Federation has rest homes and sanatoriums in various scenic spots throughout the country. Most of them are concentrated on the shore of Hungary's famous Lake Balaton. The rest homes and sanatoriums have natural hot spring treatment facilities. The Trade Union Federation assigns workers to the most suitable places for recuperation according to their health conditions. The general vacation period is two or three weeks. The fee charged is only one-fifth of the actual cost.

In addition to the system of the Trade Union Federation, many enterprises and institutions also have their own rest homes, which can accommodate 80,000 to 90,000 people. This year, about 250,000 workers spent their vacations in rest homes.

The Trade Union Federation also organizes workers to take vacations abroad every year. About 1,000 Hungarian working people are taking vacations abroad this year, including 600 who are going to the German Democratic Republic and Czechoslovakia, and the remaining 400 who are spending their holidays in the Soviet Union, Romania, and Poland. Vacations range from fourteen days to a month.

This summer, the Trade Union Federation also organized a thirteen-day cruise, during which the workers visited the major cities of Belgrade, Bucharest, and Sofia. (Attached picture)

　　巴拉顿湖畔布满休养所和疗养院
　　匈劳动人民欢度休假生活
    本报布达佩斯28日电　匈牙利总工会为争取更多的职工能享受暑期休养的优待，作了很大的努力。去年夏季有十八万职工享受了总工会休养优待。按照总工会原订的1957年计划，今年夏季将有二十万职工去休养，但是十月反革命事件破坏了这个计划，使职工福利受到了直接影响。从去年11月的情况看来，工会已没有经济能力保证职工的暑期休假生活。由于苏联和各人民民主国家在政治上和经济上的无私援助和匈牙利劳动人民的努力，使匈牙利的经济生活获得了很快的恢复。出人意料的是，今年享受工会休假优待的职工，比去年只少两万人。总工会在全国各个风景区都设有休养所和疗养院。它们大部分集中在匈牙利著名的巴拉顿湖湖畔。休养所和疗养院内都有天然温泉治疗设备。总工会按照职工健康情况分配到最适宜休养的地方去。一般休养假期是二、三个星期。所收的费用只占实际费用的五分之一。
    除总工会的系统外，许多企业和机关也有自己的休养所，可容纳八、九万人。今年在休养所度过假期的职工约二十五万人。
    总工会每年也组织职工到国外去休假。匈牙利劳动人民今年出国休假的约有一千人，其中有六百人去德意志民主共和国和捷克斯洛伐克休假，其余四百人去苏联、罗马尼亚、波兰度过他们的假日。休养从十四天到一个月不等。
    今年夏季总工会还组织了十三天的乘船旅行，乘船旅行的职工们沿途参观了贝尔格莱德、布加勒斯特和索非亚各大城市。（附图片）
