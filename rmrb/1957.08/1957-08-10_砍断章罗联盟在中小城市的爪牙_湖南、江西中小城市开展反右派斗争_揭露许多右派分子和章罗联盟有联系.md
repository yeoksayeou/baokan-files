Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 9th: A group of bourgeois rightists has recently been exposed in cities such as Hengyang, Xiangtan, Changde, and Shaoyang in Hunan Province. A considerable number of these rightists have direct or indirect relationships with the Zhang-Luo Alliance in Beijing.

    Qu Zijian, the chairman of the Hengyang Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, is a rightist who was directly "linked" with Zhang Bojun and faithfully carried out Zhang Bojun's instructions. According to mass revelations and Qu Zijian's own preliminary confession, when Qu Zijian attended the Second National Congress of the China Democratic League in February last year, Zhang Bojun instructed him, saying: "The work of democratic parties should not be too left. Being too left is not good for international relations. It doesn't matter if it is a bit to the right." Zhang Bojun also said: "Democratic parties should not mention being assistants to the Communist Party, but should open their doors to those in the middle and those who are backward." Last year, Du Maizhi, Luo Longji's henchman stationed in Hunan and secretary-general of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, also had secret talks with Qu Zijian in Hengyang, instructing him that the main task of democratic parties in the future would be to grasp "the relationship between party and non-party members" and "supervise the party," and to "organize independence and political freedom." In his daily activities, Qu Zijian consistently opposed the leadership of the Party, declaring that "cooperation with the Communist Party should not be taken seriously." Although there were no universities in Hengyang, he clamored for the "abolition of the Party committee system." He went everywhere to find fault with the Party, writing materials and offering them to Du Maizhi. During the period of great blooming and contending, he formed a small group with rightists such as Wang Huai Duan, chairman of the Hengyang Municipal Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association, and Yang Xiaolu, a member of the Hengyang Municipal Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, to launch a frenzied attack on the Party.

    Gong Yeguang, vice chairman of the Xiangtan Municipal Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and a rightist, had close ties with Wu Jingchao, a henchman of the Zhang-Luo Alliance. During the blooming and contending period, Gong Yeguang stirred up trouble everywhere, singing the tune of Zhang Bojun and Du Maizhi of the China Democratic League, that "democratic parties only accept the leadership of the CPC Central Committee." He peddled Zhang Bojun's fallacies of a "political design institute" and "finished products" at the municipal CPPCC meeting.

    According to revelations, Liu Wenbing, chairman of the Changde Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, and Ma Shaoqiao, chairman of the China Democratic League branch of Shaoyang No. 2 Middle School, are rightists who have close ties with the Zhang-Luo Alliance. People also revealed that Zeng Zhaozhi, the person in charge of the Shaoyang City Liaison Group of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, was a rightist personally selected by Xu Junhu, director of the Organization Department of the Changsha Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party.

    Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 9th: The struggle against bourgeois rightists in Jiangxi Province has expanded and deepened to medium and small cities such as Ganzhou, Shangrao, Ji'an, Fuzhou, Jiujiang, and Jingdezhen.

    Rightists have been exposed in the democratic parties, schools, and industrial and commercial circles in these places. During the period of great blooming and contending, they launched a frenzied attack on the Communist Party. Li Zengxi, the vice-principal of Ganzhou Health School and a rightist, slandered that "the main contradiction in the country is the contradiction between the Party's formal logical leadership method and the realistic dialectical logic." He attacked the Party's leadership of schools and hospitals as "laymen leading experts, guests leading hosts." Li Shuhua, the chairman of the Ji'an Municipal Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, even openly proposed to engage in a "three-thirds system of joint government" and to "unite the democratic parties to deal with the Communist Party." Fu Tihuan, the Minister of Organization of the Jiujiang Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League and a rightist, advocated that the National Committee of the CPPCC should be the core of leadership, not the Communist Party, and that major national affairs should be decided by the CPPCC.

    According to the exposure, many of these rightists have close ties with Xu Deyi and Liu Jiufeng, agents of the Zhang-Luo Alliance in Jiangxi. The rightist group headed by He Xingnan, chairman of the Shangrao Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, Jiang Qian, chairman of the Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, and Yao Bo, chairman of the Ji'an Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, followed the instructions of Zhang Bojun, Xu Deyi, and Liu Jiufeng to stir up trouble everywhere to attack the Party and actively develop their organization. He Xingnan and others openly declared that "counter-revolutionaries can also be developed." Liu Yiyan, chairman of the Jingdezhen Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, vice-chairman of the Municipal CPPCC, and a rightist, followed the instructions of Xiang Fayi (deputy secretary-general of the provincial committee of the China Democratic League), a key member of the Xu Deyi and Liu Jiufeng rightist group, to set fires everywhere, vainly hoping that a Hungarian incident would occur in China.

    砍断章罗联盟在中小城市的爪牙
    湖南、江西中小城市开展反右派斗争
    揭露许多右派分子和章罗联盟有联系
    据新华社长沙9日电　湖南省衡阳、湘潭、常德、邵阳等城市最近揭露出一批资产阶级右派分子。这些右派分子中，有相当一部分人和北京的章罗联盟有直接或间接的关系。
    民盟衡阳市委主任委员屈子健是和章伯钧直接“挂钩”并忠实执行章伯钧指示的右派分子。根据群众揭露和屈子健本人的初步交代，去年2月屈子健参加民盟全国第二届代表大会期间，章伯钧曾指示他说：“民主党派工作不能过左，左了在国际方面不利，右一点倒没有什么关系。”章伯钧还说：“民主党派不要提共产党的助手，要向中间、落后（分子）开门。”去年，罗隆基集团派驻湖南的干将、民盟湖南省委秘书长杜迈之也到衡阳市和屈子健密谈，曾指示他民主党派今后的主要工作是抓“党与非党关系”“对党进行监督”，要“组织独立和政治自由”。屈子健在他平日的活动中就一贯反对党的领导，扬言“与共产党合作莫认真”，虽然衡阳市没有什么大学，他却大叫要“取消党委制”。他到处找党的岔子写成资料献给杜迈之。在大鸣大放中，他和民建衡阳市委主委王恢端、民革衡阳市委委员杨晓麓等右派分子组成小集团，向党猖狂进攻。
    湘潭市民革市委副主委、右派分子龚业光和章罗联盟干将吴景超有密切联系。龚业光在鸣放期间到处点火，大唱民盟章伯钧、杜迈之所谓“民主党派只接受中共中央领导”等调子，他在市政协会上贩卖章伯钧“政治设计院”、“成品”的谬论。
    据揭露，常德市民盟市委主委刘文炳、邵阳市第二中学民盟支部主委马少桥都是和章罗联盟有密切关系的右派分子。人们还揭露，农工民主党邵阳市联络组负责人曾昭智，是农工民主党长沙市委组织处长、右派分子徐君虎亲手挑选出来的右派分子。
    据新华社南昌9日电　江西省反对资产阶级右派分子的斗争，已经扩大和深入到赣州、上饶、吉安、抚州、九江、景德镇等中、小城市。
    这些地方的民主党派组织、学校、工商界中都已暴露出有右派分子。他们在大鸣大放中向共产党展开了疯狂的进攻。赣州卫生学校副校长、右派分子栗增锡污蔑说“目前国家的主要矛盾是党的形式逻辑领导方法和辩证逻辑的现实之间的矛盾”。他攻击党对学校、医院的领导“是外行领导内行，客人领导主人”。民革吉安市主任委员李树华还公开提出要搞“三三制的联合政府”，要“联合民主党派对付共产党”。九江市民盟组织部长、右派分子傅趯寰主张以全国政协为领导核心，不要共产党为领导核心，国家大事由政协作出决定”。
    据揭发在这些右派分子中，有不少是同章、罗联盟在江西的代理人许德瑗、刘九峰等有密切联系。上饶市的右派分子民盟市委主任委员何星南、农工民主党市委主任委员蒋谦和民盟吉安市委主任委员姚博为首的右派集团就是根据章伯钧、许德瑗、刘九峰等的指示，到处点火向党进攻，并积极发展组织。何星南等公然宣称“反革命分子也可以发展”。民盟景德镇市委主任委员、市政协副主席、右派分子刘一燕，就是根据许德瑗、刘九峰右派集团中的骨干分子向法宜（民盟省委副秘书长）的指示，到处放火，妄想中国出现匈牙利事件。
