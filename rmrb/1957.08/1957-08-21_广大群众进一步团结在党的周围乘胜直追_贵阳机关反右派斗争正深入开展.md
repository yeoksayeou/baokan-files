　　The Broad Masses Further Unite Around the Party to Pursue Victory
　　Anti-Rightist Struggle in Guiyang Organs Developing in Depth
    (Our dispatch) According to the "Guizhou Daily", the anti-Rightist struggle in the organs directly under the jurisdiction of Guiyang City, Guizhou Province, has achieved great victory.
    Judging from the materials that have been revealed, the Rightists who attacked the Party this time were mostly resisters of the Democratic Revolution and the Socialist Revolution, and were defeated "heroes" who had been struggled against in the Five Great Movements and the Three Great Transformations, or their family members. These people had long adopted various covert methods in the organs to attack the Party and the leadership. When the rectification movement began, they blatantly launched a large-scale attack on the Party. For example, Zhang Shaoxing, a Rightist element of the Guiyang City Food Company, was of bad character, and had played with and insulted more than fifty women before and after the liberation. He had long refused the organization's investigation of him, was hostile to the Party, wooed the backward, attacked activists, and spread reactionary remarks. Taking advantage of the opportunity of great blooming and contending, he intensified his all-out and frantic attack on the Party. He cursed, "Party members are masters, Communist Youth League members are young masters, the masses are slaves, and activists are plainclothes police." He slandered the "Hundred Schools of Thought Contending" as "Hundred Schools of Thought Contending for Fame, Contending for Power and Profit." He clamored: "The problems of China cannot be solved without great democracy. Party members, Communist Youth League members, and activists only account for one-seventh of the total population. If great democracy is carried out, averaging six people to grab one, there will be no problem." After these reactionary fallacies were refuted, he threatened, "Whoever wants to rectify me, I will rectify him, but I will rectify the big ones. Knives can rectify, stones can rectify, and weapons can be taken out if necessary." Under the condemnation of the masses, this poisonous snake has now revealed its true colors.
    It is a common trick of the Rightists to attack the leadership of the Party from different work departments, to obliterate the great achievements of various undertakings under the leadership of the Party, and to vainly attempt to usurp the leadership of various departments. Tang Zaifu and Xie Keren, Rightists of the Guiyang City Intermediate People's Court, shot many poisonous arrows at the Party in order to usurp the leadership of judicial work. Xie Keren openly supported Luo Longji's absurd proposal for a "Rehabilitation Committee." He slandered the socialist legal system as "rule by man" and not "rule by law," saying that the laws of our country are "castles in the air" and "slogans." He openly opposed the Party's leadership of judicial work, and arrogantly called on the leadership to step down. He said, "If you don't understand the law, don't do it. If you do it, you will violate the law," and boasted among the masses that he understood the law best. In the struggle, the masses exposed his conspiracy. It turned out that he was a puppet judge before liberation, and the "law" he understood was the "law" to suppress the people and protect the reactionary rulers. In the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, he had repeatedly used his position to deliberately misjudge cases in an attempt to lightly sentence some heinous counter-revolutionaries. Ye Xinfu, the Rightist element of the Production and Wage Department of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, was also like this. He tried every means to instigate the masses to oppose the leadership of the Party and carried out a series of anti-Party activities in a planned, strategic and organized manner. Now that his conspiracy has been exposed, the Party's leadership over the work of various departments has been further strengthened.
    A small handful of Rightists within the Party have also been exposed in various organs in Guiyang City. They acted as internal collaborators in the rampant attacks of the Rightists outside the Party, and became shameful traitors. Tang Zhenggui, Shao Rujie, and Pang Zhenxin, Rightists within the Party of the organs of the Guiyang Municipal Party Committee, were such people. Tang Zhenggui was a cadre of the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee and was a vanguard in the Rightist's attack on the Party. Hanging the sign of "Communist Party Member," he actively incited the masses to oppose the Communist Party. He said, "I am a Communist Party member, and I am not afraid. What are you afraid of?" And he personally went to various departments and outside units to collect "materials" of responsible comrades, distorted and fabricated them, directed others to write articles and draw cartoons, and wantonly attacked the leadership. Other Rightists called him the "pioneer" in attacking the Party. He also put forward a series of reactionary fallacies attacking the Party's cadre policy, attacking veteran cadres, and slandering the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, claiming that he would never give up until certain leaders were brought down.
    Now, the anti-Rightist struggle front in Guiyang City is constantly expanding. The ranks of activists are gradually expanding, the broad masses have received profound education, and they are further united around the Party. Some Rightists have initially bowed their heads and confessed their guilt. At present, all organs are pursuing victory and carrying out the struggle in depth.

　　广大群众进一步团结在党的周围乘胜直追
　　贵阳机关反右派斗争正深入开展
    本报讯　据贵州日报消息：贵州省贵阳市市属机关的反右派斗争已经取得很大胜利。
    从已经揭露的材料来看，这次向党进攻的右派分子，大都是民主革命、社会主义革命的抵抗者，是五大运动、三大改造中被斗争过的落魄“英雄”或者是他们的家属。这些人长期来在机关中就采取各种隐蔽手法，攻击党、攻击领导。到这次整风运动开始，就明目张胆地向党大肆进攻。如贵阳市食品公司右派分子张绍兴品质恶劣，解放前后他共玩弄污辱过五十多个妇女。他长期拒绝组织对他的审查，对党敌视，拉拢落后，打击积极分子，散布反动言论。这次乘大放大鸣之机，变本加厉向党展开了全面的、疯狂的进攻。他谩骂“党员是老爷，团员是少爷，群众是奴才，积极分子是便衣警察。”诬蔑“百家争鸣”是“百家争名，争权夺利”。扬言：“没有大民主不能解决中国的问题，全国党团员和积极分子只占总人口的七分之一，如果进行大民主，平均六个人抓一个，不成问题。”在他这些反动谬论受到批驳之后，又威胁说：“谁要整我，我也要整他，不过我要整大的，刀子可以整，石头可以整，必要时还可以拿出武器来。”在群众怒斥下，现在这条毒蛇已经原形毕露了。
    从不同工作部门来攻击党的领导，抹煞党领导下各项事业的伟大成绩，妄想篡夺各部门的领导权，是右派分子的共同伎俩。贵阳市中级法院右派分子唐载福和谢克仁为了篡夺司法工作的领导，向党射出许多毒箭。谢克仁公开支持罗隆基的“平反委员会”的荒谬主张。诬蔑社会主义的法制是“人治”不是“法治”，说我们国家的法律是“空中楼阁”，是“口号”。公然反对党对司法工作的领导，并狂妄地叫领导下台。他说：“你不懂法，你就不要干，干了就违法”，并在群众中自吹他最懂法律。在斗争中，群众戳穿了他的阴谋，原来解放前他是一个伪审判官，他懂的“法律”是镇压人民保护反动统治者的“法律”。在镇压反革命运动中他就曾经多次利用职务，故意错判案件，企图把一些罪大恶极的反革命分子轻判。市工会的生产工资部部长右派分子叶新复，也是这样，他千方百计煽动群众反对党的领导，有计划、有策略、有组织地进行了一系列反党活动。现在，他的阴谋勾当被揭穿了，党对各部门工作的领导更加强了。
    在贵阳市各机关中也揭露出一小撮党内的右派分子，他们在党外右派猖狂进攻中，充当内应，沦为可耻的叛徒。中共贵阳市委机关党内右派分子唐正规、邵汝杰、庞振新就是这种家伙。唐正规是市委宣传部干事，是右派向党进攻的急先锋。他挂着“共产党员”的牌子，积极煽动群众反对共产党。他说：“我是共产党员，我都不怕，你们还怕什么”。并亲自到各部门及外单位收集负责同志的“材料”，加以歪曲捏造，指挥别人写文章、画漫画，大肆攻击领导。其他右派分子称他为向党进攻的“开路先锋”。他并提出一套攻击党的干部政策、攻击老干部、诬蔑肃反运动等一系列的反动谬论，声称不把某些领导拉下台决不罢休。
    现在，贵阳市的反右派斗争战线正在不断扩展。积极分子队伍逐渐扩大，广大群众受到深刻的教育，进一步团结在党的周围。部分右派分子已经初步低头认罪。目前各机关正乘胜直追，深入开展斗争。
