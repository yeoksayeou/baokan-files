Xinhua News Agency report: The vigorous socialist ideological education movement in the rural areas of Gansu Province has achieved great results.

Since the launch of the movement, Communist Party organizations at all levels across the province have systematically organized and trained tens of thousands of propaganda personnel to go deep into the production teams of agricultural cooperatives to publicize the relationship between workers and peasants, the policy of unified purchase and sale, and the peasants' pace towards the socialist road has become even firmer.

Some time ago, some cooperative members in some rural areas of Minqin County demanded withdrawal from the cooperatives, and some cooperative members planned to abandon agriculture and engage in commerce. Fourteen peasant households in the Yucheng Agricultural Cooperative even ran to the cooperative cadres to ask for money and food, shouting that they would "starve to death." Therefore, Yucheng, Yushun and other agricultural cooperatives held debates on whether life had improved after agricultural cooperativization. During the debate, some cooperative members compared their past and present lives. Everyone realized that it was a case of not appreciating the good fortune they were in to still be crying about being poor. After several forums and debates, those who originally wanted to withdraw from the cooperative and engage in commerce changed their minds and expressed their determination to take the road of agricultural cooperation for common prosperity. The sound of complaining about poverty could no longer be heard.

Agricultural cooperatives in Huixian County, Wenxian County and other places discussed whether the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain was good, and whether the 340 jin of grain retained per person (including locally produced potatoes, calculated at four jin equivalent to one jin of grain) was enough to eat. At the discussion meeting in Maying Township, some people thought that "340 jin of grain is not enough to fill the gaps between teeth," and others thought that this statement was unfounded. After careful calculation, it was proven that this grain retention standard was appropriate based on the local current production level. Some cooperative members of the Xianglang Agricultural Cooperative did not understand the principle of "nation first, individual second" and were unwilling to sell surplus grain to the state. At the forum, cooperative members recalled the fact that the government had transported grain from other places to provide relief during the spring famine and said, "If the pot is empty, there will be nothing in the bowl. If we don't sell surplus grain to the state now, who will we rely on if there is another disaster in the future?" After the meeting, everyone selected 4,000 jin of good grain and sent it to the state warehouse in the rain.

    甘肃农民坚决走社会主义道路
    据新华社讯　甘肃省农村中声势浩大的社会主义思想宣传运动，已经取得很大的成绩。
    运动开展以来，全省各级共产党组织有计划地组织和训练的几万人的宣传队伍，深入到农业社的生产队，进行关于工农关系，统购统销政策的宣传，农民走社会主义道路的步伐更加坚定了。
    前些日子，民勤县的一些农村中曾有部分社员要求退社，有的社员打算弃农经商。玉成农业社的十四户农民还跑到社干部那里要钱要粮食，喊着要“饿死”。于是，玉成、雨顺等农业社就针对农业合作化后生活有没有改善的问题开会辩论。在辩论中，有些社员把自己过去和现在的生活作了对比。大家认识到：现在还喊穷，真是身在福中不知福。经过几次座谈辩论，原来要退社、经商的都改变了主意，表示坚决走农业合作化大家富裕的道路，叹穷声再也听不见了。
    徽县、文县等地的农业社讨论了粮食统购统销政策好不好，每人留粮三百四十斤（包括当地生产的洋芋，以四斤折合一斤粮食计算）是否够吃的问题。马营乡的讨论会上，有人认为“三百四十斤粮食还不够填牙缝”，有人认为这种说法没有根据。经过算细账以后，证明这个留粮标准从当地目前的生产水平来说是适当的。响浪农业社的一部分社员对先国家后个人的原则搞不通，不愿卖余粮给国家。座谈会上，社员们回忆起春荒缺粮时政府从别的地方运粮来救济的事实，并说：“锅里缺，碗里就没有。现在有余粮不卖给国家，将来再有灾荒靠谁？”会后，大家就挑选上好粮食四千斤，冒雨送往国家仓库。
