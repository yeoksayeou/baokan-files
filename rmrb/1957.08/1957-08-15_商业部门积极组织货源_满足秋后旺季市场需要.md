    Commercial Departments Actively Organize Goods Supply
    To Meet Market Needs During the Post-Autumn Peak Season

    The commercial department system is actively organizing goods supply to meet market supply during the post-autumn peak season. This year, because the work of organizing goods supply started earlier and the commodity purchase tasks for the first half of the year were completed well, the total value of commodity inventory has greatly increased. According to statistics at the end of June, the total value of industrial product inventory increased by 1,140 million yuan compared with the beginning of the year. From the perspective of commodity categories and varieties, except for a few commodities with a slightly reduced supply compared with the same period last year and some commodities maintaining the same supply level as the same period last year, the supply of most commodities has increased. According to statistics from the Ministry of Commerce, the number of bicycles supplied to the market in the second half of this year increased by 13.4% compared with the original supply plan, radios increased by 41.7%, and most commodities such as thin paper, kerosene for civilian use, towels, socks, rubber shoes, flashlights, and sanitary clothing also had varying degrees of increase in supply compared with the same period last year; bamboo shell thermos bottles, cloth-faced rubber shoes, and steel pots were also no lower than the supply level of the same period last year. The commodities with relatively tight supply to the market in the second half of this year include cotton cloth, coal, and kerosene.

    From the perspective of the goods currently controlled by the commercial departments, the supply of some daily necessities and small commodities, some cultural supplies, some electrical appliances, and small hardware is sufficient, and they can basically meet market needs. Bicycles, kerosene, coal, cotton cloth, and some knitwear are in relatively tight supply due to excessive sales in the first half of the year and insufficient resources, but they can basically ensure market supply according to the plan.

    In order to ensure market supply during the post-autumn peak season, the commercial departments are making reasonable arrangements and adjustments between urban and rural areas and between regions, based on the spirit of reducing the quantity of goods supplied to cities and vigorously supplying rural areas. The commodities needed by remote areas and ethnic minority areas during the peak season were arranged as early as the first half of the year.

    商业部门积极组织货源
    满足秋后旺季市场需要
    商业部系统正在积极组织货源迎接秋后旺季市场供应。今年由于组织货源工作开始较早和上半年商品购进任务完成较好，商品库存总值大有增加，据6月末统计，工业品库存总值比年初增加十亿一千四百万元。从商品类别和品种看，除个别商品比去年同期供应数量有所减少和部分商品维持去年同期供应水平外，绝大部分商品供应数量有增加。据商业部统计，今年下半年供应市场的自行车比原来供应计划增加了13.4％，收音机增加41.7％，薄纸、民用煤油、毛巾、袜子、胶鞋、手电筒、卫生衣等绝大部分商品比去年同期供应数量也有不同程度的增加；竹皮暖瓶、布面胶鞋、钢精锅等也不低于去年同期供应水平；今年下半年供应市场比较紧张的商品，有棉布、煤炭、煤油。
    从商业部门现在掌握的货源情况看，一部分日用百货和小百货、一部分文化用品、一部分交电、小五金等商品货源充足，基本上能够满足市场需要。自行车、煤油、煤炭、棉布和一部分针织品，因上半年超销过多和资源不足供应比较紧张，但基本上也能按照计划保证市场供应。
    为了保证秋后旺季市场供应，商业部门正在本着压缩城市供应商品数量，大力供应农村的精神，在城乡之间、地区之间进行合理的安排和调剂。边远地区、少数民族地区旺季需要的商品早在上半年作了安排。
