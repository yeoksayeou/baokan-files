　　Good News from Shenyang City's Middle and Primary School Graduates Who Went to the Countryside
　　They are Living Well in the Countryside
　　(Our Report) More than 1,000 middle and primary school graduates who went to the countryside earlier from Shenyang City are living very well in the countryside. They have gradually become accustomed to rural life and have learned some simple agricultural techniques. They are in high spirits and are happy, and have submitted applications to join the cooperative to the cooperative affairs committee. Many production cooperatives have already discussed and approved them as members. The Huanggu District Qianjin Vegetable Production Cooperative accepted 314 graduates into the cooperative; the Beiguan District Dongshan Vegetable Production Cooperative will hold a general meeting of members to discuss and approve more than 100 graduates into the cooperative.
　　The graduates who went to the Qianjin Vegetable Production Cooperative went to the fields to pick tomatoes with dew on the second day after they arrived. Junior high school graduates Na Yuhua and Lei Enbo went to the fields barefoot. The 22 graduates of the Fourth Production Team, upon hearing the news that tomatoes were out of stock in the city, used their rest time to pick a cartload and transport it to the city. Many students worked in front of the manure pit without minding the dirt. Huang Jianxing, the daughter of Deputy Governor Huang Da, fought with the old peasants for manure spoons, vying to do the work. The peasants said, "Such things can only happen under the leadership of the Communist Party. In the past, the daughter of a governor, let alone scooping manure or planting crops, would stay far away even from seeing farmers. She would have lived in a small western-style building in the city, riding in a car, as a young lady."
　　Now, the students have learned some agricultural techniques, such as tying celery, cutting eggplants, and tying sorghum heads. Many students take the initiative to learn from the old peasants. Some students have also bought a set of "Vegetable Cultivation Studies." The students are gradually becoming one with the old peasants.
　　The students' enthusiasm for labor deeply moved the members of the cooperative. Initially, the members had three concerns: they were afraid that the students would not stay long, would not obey the leadership, and would not be able to stand the sight of the peasants. The students' actions dispelled their concerns. At the members' meeting, they unanimously passed them into the cooperative. Some members said: "The Communist Party leads really well, educating the youth so well. In the past, people who had read a few years of books would have flown away long ago, and the countryside was still out of their sight!"
　　The cooperatives also take good care of the students. The Qianjin Vegetable Production Cooperative newly built dormitories, put in newly nailed beds, and covered the windows with gauze. The Nantian and Wusan vegetable production cooperatives in Shenhe District held forums for the students with old members and advanced producers. In order to help the students learn technology, the Qianjin Vegetable Production Cooperative will also invite technicians from the Provincial Department of Agriculture to give them lectures.
　　After a period of field production practice, the students realized the importance of agricultural labor and also realized that agricultural labor is not simple. The students who were originally waiting and watching also became firm. For example, An Shuyuan, a junior high school graduate from the 33rd Middle School, although she signed up to go to the countryside, was afraid that the countryside was too hard, that she would be tired and have no future, and did not dare to move her household registration. After arriving in the countryside, she saw with her own eyes that the peasants' lives were rising year by year, and everyone had new clothes. Deputy Director Zheng of the cooperative also introduced them to the five-year long-term plan, and she realized that she had a promising future in the countryside, so she moved her household registration. When she returned home, she also publicized the situation in the countryside to her neighbors. Now many students have written letters of determination, challenging each other. Determined to settle down in the countryside and not be deserters.

　　沈阳市下乡的中小学毕业生送来喜讯
　　他们在农村生活得很好
    本报讯　沈阳市先期下乡的一千余名中、小学毕业生，在农村生活得很好。他们逐渐习惯了农村生活，学会了一些简单的农业技术。他们的情绪高昂，精神愉快，纷纷向社务委员会提出入社申请书。很多生产合作社已经讨论通过他们为社员，皇姑区前进蔬菜生产合作社接受了三百一十四名毕业生入社；北关区东山蔬菜生产合作社将召开社员大会，讨论通过一百余名毕业生入社。
    到前进蔬菜生产合作社的毕业生，来到后第二天就冒着露水下地摘西红柿。初中毕业生那玉华、雷恩波光脚下地。第四生产队的二十二名毕业生，听到市里西红柿脱销的消息，利用休息时间，摘了一车，运入城里。很多同学在大粪坑前干活，也不嫌脏。黄达副省长的女儿黄建行和老农民抢粪勺，争着干。农民说：“这样的事只有在共产党领导下才会有。过去一个省长的女儿，别说舀大粪，种庄稼，看见庄稼人也离得远远的。早在城里住在小洋楼上，坐着小汽车，当小姐啦。”
    现在，学生们已经学会了一些农业技术，如绑芹菜，割茄子，绑架头等。很多同学主动地向老农民学习。还有的同学买了一套“蔬菜栽培学”。同学们逐渐和老农民打成一片。
    同学们的劳动热情深深地感动了社员。最初，社员还有三个顾虑，怕学生干不长，不服从领导，看不惯农民。同学们的行动，打消了他们的顾虑。在社员大会上，一致通过他们入社。有的社员说：“共产党领导得真好，把青年教育得这样好。过去念过几年书的人早就远走高飞了，农村还在他们眼里！”
    各合作社对同学们的照顾也很周到。前进蔬菜生产合作社新盖了宿舍，放上新钉的床铺，窗子上还罩上了纱布。沈河区南塔、五三等蔬菜生产合作社为同学们召开了老社员和先进生产者的座谈会。为了帮助同学们学技术，前进蔬菜生产合作社还要请省农业厅的技术员给他们讲课。
    经过一段时间的田间生产实习，同学们认识到农业劳动的重要意义，也体会到农业劳动并不简单。原来观望的同学，也坚定下来。如第三十三中学的初中毕业生安淑媛，虽然报名下了乡，但怕农村很苦，挨累没出息，不敢把户口迁来。到农村以后，她亲眼看到农民生活逐年上升，人人都有新衣。合作社郑副社长又向他们介绍了五年远景规划，她认识到在农村很有前途，就把户口迁来。回家时，她还向四邻宣传农村的情况。现在很多同学写了决心书，互相挑战。决心在农村安家立业，不做逃兵。
