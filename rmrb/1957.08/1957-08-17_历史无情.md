    History is Merciless
    Keyue
    History is constantly advancing, and if people do not move forward with this wheel, they will be mercilessly thrown behind it by history. It is not at all surprising that yesterday's leftist may transform into today's rightist.
    History is constantly advancing and will never turn back; however, certain historical phenomena may resemble the "recurrence" of certain historical phenomena. For example, during the Anti-Japanese War, there were three factions within the Anti-Japanese National United Front: the "left" (the worker-peasant revolutionary forces and revolutionary intellectuals led by the Chinese Communist Party, as well as those within the Kuomintang who resolutely supported the Anti-Japanese War and democracy), the "middle" (the national bourgeoisie, the upper petty bourgeoisie and their intellectuals, as well as the democratic parties associated with this class, the more enlightened figures within the Kuomintang, and the enlightened gentry in local areas), and the "right" (the Kuomintang in power, headed by Chiang Kai-shek). As the wheel of history continued to advance, the rightists of the Anti-Japanese War became enemies of the masses; however, during the War of Liberation, the People's Democratic United Front still contained the "left" (the worker-peasant alliance led by the Chinese Communist Party and all those who were determined to carry the revolution through to the end), the "middle" (the national bourgeoisie and the upper petty bourgeoisie, as well as the majority of the democratic parties and intellectuals associated with them), and the "right" (the right wing of the national bourgeoisie and the democratic parties, namely those who advocated the middle road and division of land for governance). This situation also exists in the socialist revolution stage. Because the task of the revolution has changed or advanced, the attitude of the revolutionary allies towards the revolution will also be different; and the leading class of the revolution will make new demands on the allies at every step forward. Taking the socialist revolution stage as an example, the revolutionary demands before and after the high tide of socialist transformation are also different. Before the high tide, the demand was for the national bourgeoisie and its intellectuals to accept socialist transformation; after the high tide, the demand was for them to serve socialism and be transformed into self-reliant laborers. Therefore, at every turning point in history, every class and every social group, as well as their members, need to re-enlist. There are still three camps, but sometimes the lineup is different. As far as the class is concerned, which camp it stands in during that revolutionary period is determined by history, and no one can force it. As far as the individual is concerned, although his class nature will play a role, and there are clues to follow as to which faction he will stand in, he can still control his own destiny and make choices through subjective efforts.
    The attitude of the leading class of the revolution towards these three forces was announced to the world long ago during the Anti-Japanese War. That is: to develop the progressive forces (leftists), to win over the middle forces (middle elements), and to isolate and attack (and divide) the stubborn forces (rightists). This is an established policy of the Communist Party towards allies within the united front, and also a clearly announced strategy towards allies. Therefore, we will not be afraid of being slandered by rightists as engaging in "small circles" or "sectarianism," nor will we be afraid of "developing progressive forces" and "isolating and attacking (and dividing) stubborn forces"; nor will we waver in the slightest because they play the rogue, shouting that they "were originally leftists," that they were "wrongly classified," and saying that "putting me in the rightist camp this time, under the label of anti-Party and anti-socialism, has lost a person who could have played a role in the anti-rightist struggle." History is merciless, and people can only become the forerunners of society after grasping its laws of development; if they violate this law and act perversely, they will become traitors to history. The rightists of the Anti-Japanese War who "respond to all changes with immutability" finally became enemies of the masses, which is a warning for today's rightists!

    历史无情
    克约
    历史是不断前进的，人们如不随着这个车轮前进，它就会被历史无情地抛在车轮的后面。昨天的左派，可能蜕变为今日的右派，是毫不足奇怪的。
    历史是不断前进的，决不会走回头路；但历史的某些现象却可能似历史的某些现象的“复归”。如抗日战争时期，抗日民族统一战线内部是存在有“左”（中国共产党所领导的工农革命力量和革命知识分子以及国民党内坚决赞助抗日与民主的人）、“中”（民族资产阶级、上层小资产阶级和其知识分子，以及与这个阶级有联系的民主党派、国民党内比较开明人士和地方上的开明士绅）、“右”（以蒋介石为首的当权的国民党）三派的。历史的车轮继续前进了，抗战时期的右派变为人民大众的敌人；但在解放战争时期，人民民主统一战线内部仍然是存在有“左”（中国共产党所领导的工农联盟和一切坚决将革命进行到底的人）、“中”（民族资产阶级和上层小资产阶级，以及与其有联系的民主党派和知识分子中的大多数）、“右”（民族资产阶级和民主党派的右翼，即是那些主张走中间路线和分地而治的人）。就是在社会主义革命阶段，同样是存在着这种情形的。因为革命的任务改变了或者是前进了，革命的同盟者对革命的态度也会随着有所不同；而且革命的领导阶级对同盟者在每一个前进步骤都会提出新的要求来的。以社会主义革命阶段来论，社会主义改造高潮前和后的革命要求也是有所不同的。高潮前是要求民族资产阶级和其知识分子接受社会主义改造的问题；高潮后是要求他们为社会主义服务，改造成为自食其力的劳动者的问题。因此，在每一个历史的转变关头，各个阶级和各个社会集团以及他们的成员，都需要重新站队。阵地还是三块，但有时阵容是不同的。就阶级来说，它在那个革命时期站在那一块阵地，是历史注定了的，任何人不可能强求的。就人来说，虽然他的阶级性要起作用，究竟站在那一派，也有其脉络可索；但还是可以自己掌握其命运，而经过主观努力，能有所选择。
    革命的领导阶级对待这三种势力的态度，在抗日战争时期早就昭告于世人。即是：发展进步势力（左派），争取中间势力（中间分子），孤立和打击（以及分化）顽固势力（右派）。这是共产党对统一战线内部同盟者的一个既定的方针，也是明白宣布的一个对同盟者的策略。因此，我们不会怕被右派分子诬骂我们是搞“小圈子”是“宗派主义”，也不会怕“发展进步势力”，和“孤立和打击（以及分化）顽固势力”；更不会因他们耍无赖，大叫什么他“原来是左派”，把他“划错”了，说“这次把我摆在右派里，在反党反社会主义的帽子下面，失去了一个在反右派斗争中能起作用的人、”而有丝毫动摇。历史是无情的，人们只能在掌握了它的发展规律以后才能成为社会的前驱者；违反了这个规律而倒行逆施，他就会成为历史的叛逆者了。抗战时期的右派“以不变应万变”，终于成为人民大众的敌人，实可为今日右派的殷鉴！
