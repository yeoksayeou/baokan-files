A New Conspiracy to Invade Syria is Brewing
By a commentator of this newspaper

    A new American conspiracy to invade Syria is brewing.

    The Syrian government recently exposed a major conspiracy directly planned and directed by the United States to subvert the current Syrian regime. This conspiracy further exposed the ambitious and aggressive nature of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" and placed American imperialism in a very embarrassing situation. But the United States will never lay down its butcher's knife. It is colluding with Britain and the countries participating in the Baghdad Pact, actively preparing a new conspiracy to invade Syria.

    After Syria exposed the American subversion conspiracy and took some measures to consolidate internally, the United States immediately launched a propaganda campaign against Syria. American officials and its propaganda machine clamored that Syria would become a "communist state" and insisted that Syria's actions to oppose aggression and maintain independence were a so-called "threat" to its neighbors. Why is the United States launching this propaganda offensive? The purpose is obviously to prepare public opinion for its next step in invading Syria.

    News from Washington, London, and the Middle East indicates that the United States is plotting an open invasion of Syria. To this end, the United States and Britain held high-level talks in Washington. From all indications, the United States has selected Turkey as the vanguard of the invasion of Syria, with the countries of the Baghdad Pact, including the United States and Britain, providing support. Reuters reported from Washington that the United States had "consulted" the countries of the Baghdad Pact for their opinions on the Syrian situation, with Washington paying particular attention to Turkey's reaction. U.S. Senator Mansfield has publicly called on Syria's neighbors to "take full precautions."

    For some time, Turkey has been used by the United States as a tool to put pressure on Syria. During the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt, when the United States engineered a coup in Jordan, and when right-wing pro-imperialist forces in Syria attempted to take action, Turkey created tension on the Syrian-Turkish border to coordinate. This time, after Syria exposed the American subversion conspiracy, there were reports that Turkey had concentrated a large number of troops on the Syrian border. It is particularly noteworthy that before the American conspiracy was exposed, the King of Iraq was in Turkey, and Iraqi Defense Minister Baban also went to Turkey for consultations. There are also reports that King Hussein of Jordan will also go to Turkey. It is quite obvious that the United States is attempting to use Turkey, Iraq, and Jordan to encircle Syria, coordinate with each other, and use the strategy of having Middle Easterners fight Middle Easterners to promote its "Eisenhower Doctrine" of invading the Middle East.

    The United States' adoption of this insidious method of invading Syria is the result of the strong opposition of the people of the Middle East to the "Eisenhower Doctrine" for more than half a year. At the beginning of this year, the United States, under the banner of the "Eisenhower Doctrine," rampaged through the Middle East with arrogance, treating the Middle East as its own territory and acting as the master and protector of the Middle East. However, it has become increasingly clear that for American imperialism, the Middle East is not a vacuum of comfort, but a live volcano burning with the flames of nationalism. The United States, relying on its dollars and military force, created the Jordan incident, divided and instigated Arab countries, and attempted to isolate and attack Egypt and Syria. But what the United States has won over is only the feudal forces and the upper bourgeoisie in some countries, and what the United States has exposed is the ferocious face of a colonialist. The result of the United States' manipulation in the Middle East has instead strengthened the national and historical ties between the vast Arab peoples, which are linked by the common demand of anti-colonialism.

    For more than half a year, the spearhead of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" has always been directed at Egypt and Syria. On the one hand, American imperialism has colluded with some Western European countries to put economic pressure on Egypt and Syria, while at the same time instigating imperialist agents in Syria and Egypt, attempting to overthrow the nationalist governments of these two countries and change their policies of adhering to independence and opposing colonialism through subversive activities. On the other hand, the United States has also instigated Israel and some Arab countries to put pressure on Egypt, especially Syria, to cooperate with subversive activities in these two countries. But these subversive conspiracies have failed one after another. The United States has seen that, under the current situation in Syria, the hope of successful subversion is becoming increasingly slim. Therefore, it has to seek the path of open aggression. Although the United States is still attempting to remain in the position of a behind-the-scenes planner, superficially spreading an atmosphere of "wait and see," this tactic of the United States cannot conceal its ambition to actively prepare for aggression. Everyone can see that since the end of the Suez War, the tense situation in the Middle East has not been eased, which is entirely the result of the United States intensifying its aggression in the Middle East.

    The Syrian people, in defeating the conspiracies of American imperialism again and again, have not only gained rich experience in opposing aggression, but also strengthened internal unity. At the same time, the Syrian people are by no means isolated. They have the sympathy and support of the people of all Arab countries and peace-loving countries and people all over the world. As long as the Syrian people are united and persist in their struggle, the Syrian people will, like the Egyptian people, smash any aggressive conspiracies of imperialism.

　　侵略叙利亚的新阴谋在酝酿中
　　本报评论员
    美国侵略叙利亚的一个新阴谋正在酝酿中。
    叙利亚政府最近揭露了由美国直接策划和指挥的颠覆叙利亚现政权的大阴谋。这个阴谋进一步暴露了“艾森豪威尔主义”的野心勃勃的侵略实质，使美帝国主义处于十分狼狈的境地。但是美国决不会就此放下屠刀。它正在纠合英国和参加巴格达集团的国家，积极准备一个对叙利亚的新的侵略阴谋。
    在叙利亚揭露了美国的颠覆阴谋并且为巩固内部而采取了一些措施以后，美国立即发动了一个反对叙利亚的宣传运动。美国官方和它的宣传机器大叫大嚷，说什么叙利亚将成为一个“共产党国家”，并且硬说叙利亚的反对侵略、维护独立的行动，是对它的邻国的一种所谓“威胁”。美国为什么要进行这种宣传攻势呢？目的显然是在为它侵略叙利亚的下一步行动作好舆论准备。
    从华盛顿、伦敦和中东地区传来的消息可以看出，美国正在策划对叙利亚进行公开侵略。美国和英国为此在华盛顿举行了最高级会谈。从各方面迹象看来，美国已经选定土耳其作为侵略叙利亚的先锋，而包括美国和英国在内的巴格达集团各国则加以支持。路透社从华盛顿报道说，美国已经向巴格达集团国家“征询”了对叙利亚局势的意见，华盛顿方面特别注意土耳其的反应。而美国参议员曼斯菲尔德已公开要求叙利亚的邻国“采取充分的预防措施”。
    在过去一段时期中，土耳其一直被美国利用来作为对叙利亚施加压力的工具。在英法侵略埃及的时候，在美国在约旦制造政变以及叙利亚国内右翼亲帝国主义势力企图有所行动的时候，土耳其都在叙、土边境上制造紧张局势，予以策应。这次叙利亚揭露美国颠覆阴谋以后，又有消息说，土耳其在叙利亚边境上集中了大量部队。特别值得注意的是，在美国阴谋败露以前，伊拉克国王就在土耳其，伊拉克国防大臣巴班也到土耳其去进行会商。还有消息说，约旦国王侯赛因也要到土耳其去。十分明显，美国企图利用土耳其、伊拉克、约旦包围叙利亚，互相策应，用中东人打中东人的策略，来推行它的侵略中东的“艾森豪威尔主义”。
    美国采取这种阴险手法侵略叙利亚，是“艾森豪威尔主义”半年多来遭到中东人民强烈反对的结果。在今年年初，美国打着“艾森豪威尔主义”的旗帜，在中东横冲直撞，气焰嚣张，把今日之中东当作是美国的天下，俨然以中东的主人和保护者自居。然而，事情越来越明显，对于美帝国主义来说，中东并不是一个真空的安乐窝，而是燃烧着民族主义火焰的一座活火山。美国依靠着它的美元和武力，制造了约旦事件，在阿拉伯国家中进行分化和挑拨，企图孤立和打击埃及和叙利亚。但是美国所拉拢到的，仅仅是某些国家中的封建势力和资产阶级上层分子，而美国所暴露的，却是一副殖民主义者的凶恶面孔。美国在中东纵横捭阖的结果，反而加强了广大阿拉伯人民之间被反殖民主义共同要求所联结起来的民族的、历史的纽带。
    半年多来“艾森豪威尔主义”的矛头始终指向埃及和叙利亚。美帝国主义一方面勾结了一些西欧国家，对埃及和叙利亚施加经济压力，同时在叙利亚和埃及国内策动帝国主义的代理人，企图通过颠覆活动，来推翻这两个国家的民族主义政府，改变这两个国家的坚持独立、反对殖民主义的政策。另一方面，美国又策动以色列和某些阿拉伯国家对埃及、特别是对叙利亚施加压力，配合在这两个国家内的颠覆活动。但是这些颠覆阴谋又接二连三地失败了。美国看到，在目前叙利亚国内局势下，搞颠覆活动成功的希望越来越渺茫。因此，它只好寻求公开侵略的道路。尽管美国仍然企图处于幕后策划人的地位，表面上散布“观望”的空气，但是，美国的这种手法，并不能掩饰积极进行侵略准备的野心。大家可以看到，从苏伊士战争结束以来，中东地区的紧张局势一直没有能够得到缓和，这完全是美国在中东加紧侵略的结果。
    叙利亚人民在击败美帝国主义一次又一次的阴谋中，不但取得了丰富的反对侵略的经验，而且加强了内部的团结。同时，叙利亚人民也绝不是孤立的。它们有着阿拉伯各国人民和全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的同情和支持。只要叙利亚人民团结一致，坚持斗争，叙利亚人民必将像埃及人民一样，粉碎帝国主义的任何侵略阴谋。
