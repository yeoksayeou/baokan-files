Serious Ideological Pursuit of Fame and Fortune
Led Geng Zhi to Degenerate into a Rightist

    This newspaper reports that in the anti-Rightist struggle, the Finance Cadre School affiliated with the Ministry of Finance exposed and criticized a rightist within the Party – Geng Zhi, a member of the school's Party General Branch Committee (now suspended from Party duties) and head of the Basic Construction Appropriation Teaching and Research Group. After the school's entire staff thoroughly exposed the facts and engaged in reasoned struggle, his anti-Party and anti-socialist thoughts and actions were fully revealed.

    Since joining the workforce in 1946, Geng Zhi consistently harbored serious bourgeois individualist thoughts, pursued fame and fortune, and used various methods to deceive and attack the Party. When he was the Deputy Manager of the Jiaotong Bank in the former Chahar Province, he used obstructionist and slanderous tactics to squeeze out the First Deputy Manager. He also used deceptive methods to promote six section chiefs, attempting to usurp the position of department-level cadre. After arriving at the Finance Cadre School in 1953, he again attempted to seize the positions of Director of the Teaching and Research Office and Director of the Library. When these attempts were exposed by the organization, he developed deep hatred for the Party. Geng Zhi thus transitioned from such a bourgeois individualist to the position of a rebellious Rightist.

    After the Rectification Campaign began, he wantonly slandered and attacked the Party organization and vilified leading comrades. He said that there was not a single good person in the Head Office. Among cadres at the department level and above, almost none could be trusted. Geng Zhi said that the Party General Branch of the Finance Cadre School "doesn't have a single good person." He cursed almost all the members of the General Branch Committee, using extremely vulgar language.

    He also colluded with and incited the masses to attack the Party. He even attempted to organize some backward masses to attack the leaders of the Construction Bank Head Office. To incite the masses, he did not hesitate to use rumors. He told someone: "The organization suspects that there are problems with your history. Your wife cannot join the Party and was struggled against during the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries because she married you," attempting to incite the other party's hatred toward the organization. During the period of extensive airing of views, Geng Zhi fabricated a story, saying: "The Party General Branch is going to be taken over." Geng Zhi also used issues such as rank evaluations and welfare benefits to stir up trouble among the masses, undermining the unity between the leadership and the masses. In addition, Geng Zhi openly advocated for Rightist views, even defending Rightist statements at a meeting of the General Branch Committee.

    To achieve his anti-Party goals, he even used his position as a member of the Party General Branch Committee to collude with key members who had been struggled against during the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries, using the issue of the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries to attack the Party. As soon as the Rectification Campaign began, he vowed to "rehabilitate" them, proclaiming that "now, as long as they bring it up, there is a possibility of overturning the verdict." When he heard Ling Dating attempting to overturn his verdict at a symposium, he sought Ling out for a secret talk afterwards. When Geng Zhi heard that someone was dissatisfied with their academic rank and salary, he told them: "Your rank is inappropriate. The school's organization is too bold. If I were in charge of personnel work, I wouldn't dare do it this way." Geng Zhi also leaked confidential materials from the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries.

    After Geng Zhi's reactionary words and deeds were exposed by the masses, he initially persisted in a stubborn and denying attitude. Later, after verifying the facts, engaging in serious reasoning, and holding debates, he began to admit his reactionary words and actions in front of the masses.

    严重的争名夺利思想
    使耿志堕落为右派分子
    本报讯　中央财政部所属财政干部学校在反右派斗争中，揭露和批判了一个党内右派分子——学校党总支委员（现已停止党内职务）、基本建设拨款教研组组长耿志。经过学校全体人员深入揭露事实、说理斗争以后，他的反党反社会主义的思想和行动已原形毕露。
    耿志自1946年参加工作以来，一贯存在着严重的资产阶级个人主义思想，争名夺利，用种种方法欺骗、攻击党。他在原察哈尔省交通银行任副经理时，就曾用刁难和污蔑的手段，排挤第一副经理，并用欺上瞒下的手法提拔了六个科长，企图达到其窃据处长级干部地位的野心。1953年到财政干校以后，又企图夺取教研室主任兼图书馆主任的职位。当他的这些企图被组织揭破后，就万分仇恨党。耿志就由这样的资产阶级个人主义者走上了叛党的右派分子的立场。
    整风运动开始后，他便大肆污蔑和攻击党组织，诋毁领导同志。他说总行没有一个好人。在处长级以上干部中，几乎都是不可信赖的。耿志说财政干校党总支“没有一个好人”。他几乎骂遍了总支委员，口吻极其下流。
    他还拉拢和煽动群众向党进攻。他竟企图组织一些落后群众向建设银行总行领导进攻。他为了煽动群众，竟不惜使用造谣手段。他对某人说：“组织上怀疑你历史有问题。你爱人入不了党并在肃反中被斗争，也是因为和你结了婚”。企图激起对方对组织的仇恨。正当大鸣大放期间，耿志无中生有地说：“党总支要收了”。耿志还利用评级、生活福利等问题，在群众中搬弄是非，破坏领导与群众的团结。此外，耿志还公然为右派言论张目，有一次，竟在总支委员会上为右派言论辩护。
    他为了达到反党的目的，竟以党总支委员的身份，拉拢肃反中被斗的主要成员，利用肃反问题向党进攻。整风一开始，他就发誓要为他们“平反”，宣扬说：“现在只要他们提出来，就有翻案的可能”。当他在一次座谈会上听到凌大挺企图翻案时，会后就找凌密谈。耿志听到某人对学衔、工资不满，就对他说：“你的级别是不妥，学校的组织太大胆了，如果我作人事工作，就不敢这样作。”耿志还把肃反中的机密材料泄露出去。
    耿志的反动言行被群众揭露以后，开始他还坚持顽抗、抵赖的态度，以后经过核对事实、严肃说理和展开辩论以后，他在群众面前才开始承认自己的反动言论和行动。
