Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 2nd: The Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) and the Communist Party of Austria (CPÖ) issued a joint statement here on August 1st. The statement pointed out that the talks held in Berlin from July 22nd to 29th between the delegation of the Central Committee of the SED and the delegation of the Central Committee of the CPÖ once again proved the close unity of the German and Austrian workers' movements in the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism.

During the talks, the two delegations, headed by Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the SED, and Johann Koplenig, Chairman of the CPÖ, exchanged information on the policies of the two parties and discussed the development of the international situation and the issues of the international workers' movement.

The talks showed that both sides have a completely consistent view on all the issues discussed.

The joint statement believes that the current development of the international situation is obviously in favor of peace and socialism, and the Soviet Union is the main force and center of the socialist camp and the international workers' movement. The two parties expressed their unwavering support for the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

The statement also pointed out that the two parties consistently implement Lenin's policy of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems.

If the major powers can reach an agreement on disarmament, it will be of great significance for maintaining and guaranteeing peace. The two parties support the Soviet Union's proposals in the London disarmament negotiations, and believe that establishing regions for limiting and controlling armaments in Europe is in the interests of the people of both countries. The two parties believe that the most effective way to guarantee peace and security in Europe is to establish a European collective security system that includes all countries with different social systems.

The joint statement also emphasized that the SED believes that Austria's independence and neutrality are a major achievement of the policy of peace and mutual understanding. The CPÖ believes that mobilizing all the Austrian people to guarantee Austria's independence and neutrality is one of its most important tasks.

In the joint statement, the two parties also pointed out that due to the dangerous development of the situation in West Germany, the existence of the German Democratic Republic is of increasing significance.

The statement said that the CPÖ fully supports the SED's struggle and program for the reunification of Germany.

The joint statement concluded by saying that the CPÖ delegation invited the SED to send a delegation to visit Austria, and the SED accepted this invitation.
