Passing Five Gates and Slaying Six Generals
　　Liang Ruhai

　　At a meeting, I heard a leading comrade compare the ideological remolding of intellectuals in the anti-rightist struggle and the establishment of a socialist standpoint to passing five gates and slaying six generals. The words were brief but meaningful, giving us much inspiration.

　　In the past three or four decades of history, Chinese intellectuals have indeed experienced several gates: they have gone through the gates of several revolutionary wars; they have also gone through the gate of the land reform movement. The generals guarding those gates were all very formidable enemies: imperialism, the feudal landlord class, and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie. These enemies were both standing in front of the gates and hidden in people's ideology, so it was not as easy for intellectuals to pass these gates as it was for Guan Yu back then.

　　At these checkpoints, many of them, under the leadership of the Communist Party, charged forward with their swords, not only slaying the guards but also clearing away the obstacles in their own ideologies. Despite all the difficulties, they managed to break through and transform themselves. Some hesitated at first, full of trepidation, and upon reaching the gate, either slipped through easily in the midst of the vast army, or retreated, never managing to pass. Some could not withstand the enemies or their own stubborn ideology, so they dismounted and surrendered, becoming prisoners under the command of the generals guarding the gates. There were also those who simply settled down under the command of those gatekeepers, refusing to pass the gate. The people's forces destroyed those gatekeepers, but these people still had their hearts in the "old country."

　　Looking back, everyone will have a period of bitter or sweet memories. This is a matter of knowing the taste of one's own experiences, a unique feeling in the heart.

　　Now, we have arrived at the gate of the fifth checkpoint. This is the gate of the socialist revolution.

　　This gate is easier or harder to pass than the previous four.

　　It is easier because, with the experience of passing the previous gates, they have increased their weapons to defeat the enemy and understand themselves, and their courage has greatly increased. Moreover, behind them is a stronger Party and working class, giving them the best conditions and the greatest support. However, it is more difficult because the sixth general guarding this gate is even more cunning; it is none other than all the old non-socialist or anti-socialist ideas and consciousness.

　　Some people may laugh and say: Who did you think it was? It turned out to be it! In the ideological remolding movement, I have already slain this general.

　　I say: Hold on! General, you are wrong. For many intellectuals, the ideological remolding movement only initially solved the problem of the standpoint of serving the people, and distinguished the major rights and wrongs from the ideological boundaries of the three major enemies. It is very necessary to distinguish that major right and wrong. From this anti-rightist struggle, are there not many people who still have not figured out this major right and wrong? However, on a long journey of ten thousand miles, there is always another gate after passing one. Now that we have arrived at the socialist gate, objectively speaking, the times and society have more stringent requirements for intellectuals, and subjectively, the old baggage in personal ideology can be discarded even more. This requires solving the fundamental issue of ideological standpoint and distinguishing another major right and wrong. This is: to take the socialist road or the capitalist road? To support the leadership of the Communist Party or not to support the leadership of the Communist Party? To support the socialist democratic centralism or to be infatuated with the hypocritical "democracy and freedom" of capitalism? To advocate uniting the people of the whole country or to advocate dividing the people? To consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship or to engage in the bourgeois dictatorship? To have the socialist and worldwide peace-loving people's international solidarity or to collude with imperialism? Clarifying this major right and wrong can take a bigger step forward than the ideological remolding movement of the past few years. Changing the fundamental standpoint will allow you to walk on the sunny path from now on.

　　When Guan Yu passed the Yellow River ferry at the fifth gate, the guard Qin Qi could also be considered a great general, but "the two horses crossed, and with just one exchange, Guan Gong's blade rose, and Qin Qi's head fell." He then crossed the Yellow River. And what about the general standing in front of the intellectuals now? Because it is like Sun Wukong turning into a tiny insect and drilling into the belly of Rakshasi, hidden inside everyone's mind and soul, it is not so easy to slay. Because Chinese intellectuals, over the decades of living and learning, have been in the atmosphere of the bourgeoisie, and are so affectionate and harmonious with bourgeois ideas, consciousness, and feelings; but they always feel unfamiliar and incompatible with socialist ideas, consciousness, and feelings. For many intellectuals, it is easy to support socialism in words, but difficult to conform to socialism in ideological standpoint; it is easy to understand socialism in reason, but it takes more than a day or two to transform into socialism in consciousness and feelings. Why do some Communist Party members fall into the rightist mire? One of the fundamental reasons is that they have never been of one heart and one mind with the Party, and they have never ideologically joined the Party. He can follow the Party through the previous gates, but he cannot pass the gate of socialist revolution.

　　Therefore, to slay this sixth general, one must first have the determination to completely transform oneself by fighting one's own bourgeois ideology and feelings to the death. This requires great courage. Courage comes from hatred of the ugly and decadent old ideas and consciousness, washing one's face and reforming one's heart, and having a thorough understanding. Whether or not one can resolutely cut off the enemy inside one's mind and soul, that is, whether or not one can achieve a new righteousness to eliminate relatives, is a question that every intellectual (including the author himself) must answer in this anti-rightist struggle.

### 过五关斩六将

    过五关斩六将
  　梁汝怀
    在一个会议上，听到一位领导同志把知识分子在反右派斗争中的思想改造、确立社会主义立场，喻之谓过五关斩六将。语短心长，给我们很多启发。
    在近三、四十年的历史中，中国知识分子确实经历了过好几个关：经过了好几次革命战争的关；也经过了土地改革运动的关。那些关的把关大将，都是些十分厉害的敌人：有帝国主义，封建地主阶级，有官僚资产阶级。这些敌人，既横在关前，也藏在人们的思想意识里，所以知识分子过这些关，并不全像当年关云长那样容易。
    在这些关口上，他们有许多在共产党的领导下，跃马横刀，既斩了守将，也扫清自己思想意识里的障碍，尽管历经险阻，总算闯过来，改造了自己。有的先是趦趄不前，诚惶诚恐，到得关口，或则夹杂在千军万马中轻易地混过了关，或则又退了回去，始终未能过来。有的在敌人面前或在自己的顽强的思想意识前招架不过，就下马请降，在过去那些把关大将帐下当一名俘虏。也有的根本就是安于躲在那些关主帐下，不肯过关的。人民力量摧毁了那些关主，但是这些人都仍然心在“故国”。
    回首前尘，每个人都会有一段辛酸的或者是甜甜的记忆。这是甘苦自知，别是一般滋味在心头的。
    而今，来到第五关的关口上了。这就是社会主义革命的关。
    这一关比起前四关来，说好过也好过，说难过也难过。
    说好过者，有了前几次过关的经历，手里也就增加了战胜敌人、认识自己的武器，浑身也就勇气陡增；何况在身后的，是更加壮大的党和工人阶级，给你最好的条件，最大的支持。然而，难过者，把这一关的第六将更加刁钻，原来他非别人，正是一切非社会主义或者反社会主义的旧思想、旧意识。
    有人也许哈哈大笑说：我道是谁？原来就是它！在思想改造运动中，我已斩了此将也。
    我说：且慢！将军之言差矣。当年的思想改造运动，对许多知识分子说，只是初步解决了为人民服务的立场问题，辨清了与三大敌人思想界限的大是大非。辨别那个大是大非是十分需要的，从这次反右派斗争中看，不是也有许多人至今连这个大是大非也没闹清楚吗？但是，万里长途，过了一关还有一关。如今到得社会主义关前，客观上是时代和社会对知识分子的要求更严格，主观上是个人思想意识上的旧包袱至此也可以丢得更多。这就需要解决根本的思想立场问题，明辨另一个大是非。这就是：走社会主义道路，还是走资本主义道路？拥护共产党领导，还是不要共产党领导？拥护社会主义的民主集中制，还是迷恋资本主义的虚伪的“民主自由”？主张团结全国人民，还是主张分裂人民？要巩固人民民主专政，还是要搞资产阶级专政？要社会主义的和全世界爱好和平人民的国际团结，还是要同帝国主义勾藤搭纤？弄清了这个大是非，比起前几年的思想改造运动，就能更迈进一大步。改变了根本立场，从此步步都能走上阳关大道了。
    当年关云长过第五关黄河渡口，守将秦琪也算得一员大将，然而“二马相交，只一合，关公刀起，秦琪头落”。就此渡了黄河。而现在横在知识分子面前的这一将呢？因为它正像变成蟭蟟虫儿钻进罗刹女肚子里的孙行者，是藏在每个人头脑内部、灵魂深处的，就不那么好斩。因为中国的知识分子，几十年来生聚教训，都是在资产阶级的空气里，对资产阶级的思想、意识、感情，是如此多情，一拍即合；对社会主义的思想、意识、感情，却总有些陌生，格格不入。对许多知识分子说，在口头上拥护社会主义容易，在思想立场上符合社会主义就难；在道理上懂得社会主义容易，在意识、感情上改造成社会主义的，就非一朝一夕之功。为什么有些共产党员会堕入右派泥潭，根本原因之一，就是他始终没有跟党一条心，思想上始终并没有入党。他可以跟着党通过以前几关，而在社会主义革命这一关面前，就通不过了。
    因此，斩这第六将，首先得有同自己的资产阶级思想意识感情拼个“你死我活”脱胎换骨的决心。这就需要绝大的勇气。勇气出之于对丑恶、腐朽的旧思想、旧意识的憎恨，洗面革心，大彻大悟。能不能坚决斩掉自己头脑内部、灵魂深处的敌人，也就是说能不能做到新的大义灭亲，这是每个知识分子（包括笔者本人在内）在这次反右派斗争里必须回答的问题。
