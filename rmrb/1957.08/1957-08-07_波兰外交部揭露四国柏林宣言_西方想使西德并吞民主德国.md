    Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, August 5th: The Polish Press Agency reported on August 3rd that the Polish Foreign Ministry issued a statement regarding the joint declaration on the German question by the United States, Britain, France, and West Germany, saying that the content of the Four-Power Declaration is unrealistic and does not contribute to the relaxation of the international situation. The basic intention of this declaration is to annex the German Democratic Republic, thereby incorporating the entire Germany into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and to grant the re-unified Germany, through this method, full freedom of armament.

    The Polish Foreign Ministry pointed out that this would increase the threat to Poland and increase the danger of dragging many countries into the adventurist policies of German militarism.

    The statement believes that the proposal to mechanically reunify Germany through so-called "free elections" is impractical.

    The statement also believes that, regardless of what international agreements are concluded, the most important issue for European security is that, within Germany itself, the forces committed to consolidating peace and developing good relations with its neighbors must hold a stable advantage. The German Democratic Republic has consistently pursued this policy. There are also more and more people in West Germany who support peace and a policy of friendly cooperation with all countries. Unfortunately, this is not the case with the ruling group of the Federal Republic of Germany.

    Poland expresses its support for the German Democratic Republic government's proposal of July 27th regarding the establishment of a German confederation, and expresses that it will continue to support all realistic proposals for resolving the German question on a peaceful and democratic basis in the future.

    波兰外交部揭露四国柏林宣言
    西方想使西德并吞民主德国
    据新华社华沙5日电　据波兰通讯社8月3日报道，波兰外交部就美、英、法、西德关于德国问题的联合宣言发表声明说，四国宣言的内容是不现实的，并且无助于国际局势的缓和。这个宣言的基本用意是想并吞德意志民主共和国，从而使整个德国加入北大西洋公约，并且使得用这种方法重新统一起来的德国得到充分的武装自由。
    波兰外交部指出，这就会增加对波兰的威胁，增加使许多国家被拖入德国军国主义冒险政策的危险。
    声明认为，用所谓“自由选举”的方法来机械地重新统一德国的建议，是不合乎实际的。
    声明又认为，不论订立什么样的国际协定，对欧洲安全最重要的问题在于：在德国本身，致力于巩固和平和发展同它的邻国的良好关系的力量要占稳定的优势。德意志民主共和国一贯实行这种政策。西德也有越来越多的人士拥护和平和同一切国家友好合作的政策。不幸的是，德意志联邦共和国统治集团不是这样。
    波兰表示支持德意志民主共和国政府今年7月27日关于成立德国联邦的建议，并且表示今后仍将支持在和平、民主基础上解决德国问题的一切的现实建议。
