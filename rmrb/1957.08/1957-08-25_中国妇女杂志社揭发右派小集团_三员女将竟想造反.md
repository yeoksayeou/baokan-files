　  China Women's Magazine Exposes Rightist Clique
　　Three Female Generals Actually Wanted to Rebel

    (Our dispatch) China Women's Magazine recently held a series of meetings to expose and criticize the reactionary activities of a rightist clique within the magazine. The members of this small clique are Xie Songsheng, a member of the Fourth Group; Hu Bangxiu, deputy leader of the Fourth Group and a member of the Communist Youth League; and Yan Mingshi, deputy leader of the Reader's Letters Group and a Party member.

    The fighting target of this rightist clique was directed at the magazine's editor-in-chief, deputy editor-in-chief and the Party branch secretary and deputy secretary, saying "first, strike those in power." During the period of "blooming and contending," they organized a batch of big-character posters that launched personal attacks against these comrades. Xie Songsheng, the main element of the small clique, also put forward the slogan of "firepower must be concentrated." They used vicious words to curse Party members, saying Party members were "bats," "idiots," "wooden blocks," "satellites," and "clay Buddhas"; Yan Mingshi also said that activists were "informers." They opposed the Party's cadre policy and personnel system, and supported Xiao Qian's arguments in the article "Relaxation, Tolerance, and Personnel Work." They also vigorously promoted bourgeois journalistic viewpoints and opposed the "China Women's Magazine" being led by the All-China Women's Federation's Party Group. Xie Songsheng was a target of investigation during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. She also tried her best to slander the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, spreading lies within the magazine that the organizational conclusions of her investigation were wrong.

    This small clique adopted the method of individual collusion, luring some people around them who had opinions about the Party, using their radical emotions to make them come forward to oppose the Party, while they manipulated them from behind.

    The leading figure of this small clique, Xie Songsheng, had close relations with the traitors and secret agents Huang Shunbo and Li Houfan of the Second Intelligence Group of the pseudo-Ministry of National Defense before liberation, and after liberation, she consistently resisted ideological reform. After joining the Party, Party member Yan Mingshi had always resisted and failed to implement the Party's policies, often distorting the internal situation of the Party and spreading it to the outside world. Hu Bangxiu, a member of the Communist Youth League, was an extremely serious individualist, and therefore stood with the rightists to oppose the Party and oppose socialism.

    After the anti-rightist struggle began, seeing that the situation was unfavorable, they quickly retreated, shielded each other, and even openly protected each other at the general meeting. When the masses exposed their collective activities, they shirked responsibility to each other, attempting to muddle through. At present, the fighting spirit of all the staff of the magazine is extremely high, and they are waging a merciless struggle against this rightist clique. (Shui Gong)

　  中国妇女杂志社揭发右派小集团
　　三员女将竟想造反
    本报讯　中国妇女杂志社最近连续举行会议揭发和批判该社右派小集团的反动活动。这个小集团的成员是第四组组员谢松生、第四组副组长、共青团员胡邦秀、读者来信组副组长、党员阎明诗。
    这个右派小集团的斗争锋芒是对准了该社的社长、副社长兼党支部书记和支部副书记三个人，说“先打当权的”。在鸣放时间，她们组织了一批对这些同志进行人身攻击的大字报。小集团首要分子谢松生还提出“火力必须集中”的口号。她们用恶毒的字眼咒骂党员，说党员是“蝙蝠”“笨蛋”“木头”“卫星”“泥菩萨”；阎明诗还说积极分子是“情报员”。她们反对党的干部政策、人事制度，支持萧乾在“放心·容忍·人事工作”一文中的论点。她们还大力宣扬资产阶级新闻观点，反对“中国妇女社”由全国妇联党组来领导。谢松生是肃反审查对象，她还竭力污蔑肃反运动，在社内散布组织上对她的审查结论有错误的谎言。
    这个小集团采取个别串连的方式，拉拢周围一些对党有意见的人，利用她们的偏激情绪要她们出头反对党，而她们则在背后操纵。
    这个小集团的首要人物谢松生在解放前曾和汉奸、特务黄顺伯、伪国防部二厅情报组李厚藩来往密切，解放后又一贯抗拒思想改造。党员阎明诗入党后一直抗拒不执行党的政策，经常把党内情况加以歪曲，向外散布。团员胡邦秀则是一个极端严重的个人主义者，因而和右派分子站在一起，来反对党和反对社会主义。
    反右派斗争开始后，她们见势不妙，赶紧退却，相互包庇，甚至在大会上公开掩护。当群众揭发她们的集体活动时，则又互相推卸责任，企图蒙混过关。目前该社全体工作人员战斗情绪异常高涨，正在和这个右派小集团展开无情的斗争。　（水弓）
