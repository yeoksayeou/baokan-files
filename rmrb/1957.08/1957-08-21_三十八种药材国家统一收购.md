　　三十八种药材国家统一收购
    本报讯　卫生部遵照国务院规定自由市场范围的指示，业将报经国务院批准列为国家统一收购的三十八种中药材具体品名正式通知各地卫生厅、局贯彻执行。
    通知中列为国家统一收购的三十八种中药材规定有：大黄、甘草、当归、川芎、白芍、茯苓、麦冬、生地、黄连、黄芪、贝母、枸杞、泽泻、白术、银花、党参、附子、枣仁、山药、园参、牛黄、麝香、鹿茸、全虫、枳壳、槟榔、萸肉、红花、药菊、牛夕、白芷、三七、玉金、君子、云木香、元胡、玄参、北沙参。通知明确指出：凡属以上品种在全国范围内，不分主要产区或次要产区，均由产地药材公司（包括暂未移交卫生部门的经营药材单位）或委托供销合作社按国家计划统一收购。此外，其他国营、供销社、联合诊所、公私合营药店、药厂以及商贩一律不得采购和贩运。通知中对三十八个统一收购品种以外的国产药材是要求各地一律开放，允许自由收购和贩运，并要求药材公司要积极经营。
    关于国家统一收购三十八种中药材的收购价格掌握上，通知要求应该大体保持全国平衡的水平。主产区与次产区之间必须配合统一管理。规定凡由产地流到销区时，统一由所在地的药材公司或直接委托单位按产地收购牌价加合理费用作价收购，其他单位或个人均不得收购。
