    Central Financial and Trade Departments
    Expose a Group of Rightist Backbone Elements
    Xinhua News Agency, August 8th (Reporters Feng Jian and Lin Yao): The anti-Rightist struggle in the central financial and trade departments is unfolding extensively and deeply. Recently, a group of rightist elements has been successively exposed.
    Among them, the backbone elements include: Geng Zhi from the Ministry of Finance; Lin Feng, Lin Qian, and Ren Xinzhi from the Ministry of Commerce; Yi Hong, Deng Dazhang, and Zhu Jiqun from the Ministry of Foreign Trade; Zhu Shaowen from the People's Bank; Wang Yanwen from the Central Administration of Industry and Commerce; and Zhu Dexiang and Ye Shilin from the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives.
    Zhu Shaowen used to be a traitor and is now the Deputy Director of the People's Bank Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association. His attacks against the Party and his slanderous remarks about the Party were particularly vicious. He said, "The world belongs only to the Party members, and socialist ownership is 'Party member ownership'," and he scolded Communist Party members as "good-for-nothings" and said that they "lost the sense of justice and responsibility of citizens after obtaining Party membership." During the blooming and contending period, Zhu Shaowen clamored madly, "Burn the Foreign Exchange Bureau (a bureau of the People's Bank), burn the Communist Party." During this period, he engaged in activities everywhere, and it has been revealed that he lured and incited eighteen people to set fires. Zhu Jiqun is a cunning, insidious, and two-faced fellow. On the one hand, he deliberately expressed to the leadership, "The Su Fan movement has greatly educated me," and on the other hand, he wrote articles to slander the Su Fan movement. On the one hand, he slandered the Party's various policies and past movements, and on the other hand, he feigned sincerity and sent an "application to join the Party" to the Party branch. This rightist element who played two-faced tricks was once a backbone member of the Kuomintang CC Clique and served as a psychology professor in a military intelligence training class.
    Geng Zhi and Lin Feng are both Communist Party members who betrayed the Party. Geng Zhi was the head of the basic construction teaching and research group of the Central Finance Cadre School and a member of the General Branch Committee of the CCP Finance Cadre School. Because his personal ambition to seize a higher position in the Party was not realized, he held a grudge against the Party. In his capacity as a security committee member of the Party general branch, he incited the targets of struggle in the Su Fan movement to attack the Party and vowed to "redress" some of the people who were struggled against in the Su Fan movement. Lin Feng was the director of the economic teaching and research office of the Central Commercial Cadre School, a member of the General Branch Committee of the CCP Commercial Cadre School, and a member of the rectification leadership group of the Commercial Cadre School. However, from the beginning, he colluded with the rightist elements of this school, planned and instructed the rightist elements to produce big-character posters and attack the Party behind the back of the Party organization. He repeatedly leaked the situation of the meetings of the school's rectification leadership group to the rightist element Ren Wenxue and instructed the rightist elements to "be calm" in the anti-rightist struggle.
    The exposure of this group of rightist elements by the financial and trade departments is a victory in the anti-rightist struggle of these organs in the previous stage.

### 中央财经贸易部门  揭发出一批右派骨干分子

    中央财经贸易部门
    揭发出一批右派骨干分子
    据新华社8日讯　新华社记者冯健、林耀报道：中央各财政贸易部门的反右派斗争正在广泛深入地展开。最近已经陆续揭发出一撮右派分子。
    其中骨干分子有：财政部的耿志；商业部的林枫、林迁、任新知；对外贸易部的伊洪、邓达章、朱及群；人民银行的朱绍文；中央工商行政管理局的王彦文；中华全国供销合作总社的朱德祥、叶石林等。
    朱绍文过去曾经当过汉奸，现在是民建会人民银行支部的副主任委员。他攻击党、污蔑党的言论特别恶毒，他说“天下只是党员的天下，社会所有制是‘党员所有制’”，谩骂共产党员是“饭桶”、“得了党证，丧失了公民的正义感和责任感”，鸣放期间，朱绍文疯狂地叫嚣“火烧国外局（人民银行的一个局），火烧共产党”。这一时期，他四出活动，已揭发出经他拉拢和煽动点火的人有十八人。朱及群是一个奸滑阴险、两面三刃的家伙。他一方面故意向领导上表示：“肃反运动对我的教育很大”，另一方面又写文章污蔑肃反运动，他一方面污蔑党的各项政策和历次运动，一方面又假惺惺作态，向党支部送上“入党申请书”。这个玩弄两面手法的右派分子，曾是国民党CC派的骨干分子，当过军统特务训练班的心理学教授。
    耿志和林枫，都是背叛了党的共产党员。耿志是中央财政干部学校基建教研组组长、中共财政干校总支委员。由于他企图在党内窃据较高名位的个人野心未能得逞，就对党怀恨在心。他以党总支保卫委员的身份，煽动肃反运动中的斗争对象向党进攻，并发誓要为一些肃反中被斗争的人“平反”。林枫是中央商业干部学校经济教研室主任，中共商业干校的总支委员和商业干校整风领导小组的成员，但他一开始就和这个学校的右派分子勾结在一起，背着党组织，策划和指示右派分子出大字报，向党进攻。他多次把这个学校整风领导小组开会的情况泄露给右派分子任文学，并指示右派分子在反右派斗争中“要冷静”。
    财经贸易部门揭发出这一批右派分子，是前一阶段这些机关反右派斗争的一个胜利。
