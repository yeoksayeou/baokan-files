Reducing Grain Sales
　　Shanxi Reduces Urban Non-Productive Population
　　This newspaper's Taiyuan dispatch on the 20th: Reporter Shang Kai reports: Shanxi Province has decided to rectify urban grain rationing work comprehensively, while also planning to reduce the urban non-productive population by 200,000, in order to reduce the amount of grain rationed.
　　Over the past few years, Shanxi Province's urban population has grown rapidly. The province's large and small cities and towns had a total population of more than 1.4 million in 1952, which increased to 2.58 million by the end of June 1957 (excluding 88,000 seasonal workers), an increase of 84%. More than 50% of the increased population was a reasonable increase due to the needs of national economic construction. The remaining increase was unreasonable or not entirely reasonable. For example, some construction units or government enterprise departments hired temporary workers at will without the approval of the labor department. An investigation of just nine units in Taiyuan found that they had privately hired more than 7,000 people, which induced a large number of farmers to blindly flow into the cities. Currently, among the workers driving small flatbed trucks in the city, more than 4,000 have not been approved by the state, and the floating population with no fixed occupations reaches more than 10,000. According to preliminary estimates, employees in urban administrative organs and industrial and mining enterprises who bring their families account for 60% to 70%, and in some cases even reach 80%. Due to lax household registration management, the phenomenon of falsely reporting the population, unregistered persons, and impersonation to obtain grain supplies is also common. For example, in Yangquan City, the number of people who were falsely reported or whose supply certificates did not match accounted for 4.8% of the supplied population.
　　The rapid increase in the urban population has not only reduced the rural labor force, affecting production, but has also made urban grain supplies increasingly tight. For example, in 1953, the state fixed the supply of grain to the province's cities and towns at 1 billion jin. By the 1956-1957 fiscal year, it had increased to 1.56 billion jin. To address this, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee have decided to reduce the existing non-productive population in the cities and towns and mobilize them to return to their hometowns for production.
　　The main targets for reducing the urban population are people who live in the cities but have no fixed occupations, family members of employees who have the ability to work, and people who have the conditions to be supported in the countryside.

### 减少粮食销量　山西压缩城镇非生产人口

    减少粮食销量
　　山西压缩城镇非生产人口
    本报太原20日电　记者商恺报道：山西省决定在全面整顿城镇粮食统销工作的同时，有计划地压缩城镇非生产人口二十万，以减少粮食统销数量。
    几年以来，山西省城镇人口增长的很快。全省大小城镇在1952年共有人口一百四十多万人，到1957年6月底，增至二百五十八万人（不包括八万八千名季节工人），增长84％。增加的人口中，有50％以上，是随着国家经济建设的需要而增加，因此是合理的。其余增加的部分，就不合理和不完全合理。如有些工程建筑单位或政府企业部门，不经劳动部门批准，随便雇用临时工人，仅太原九个单位的调查，私自雇用了七千多人，结果诱使农民大批盲目流入城市。现在全市小平车工人中，未经国家批准的就有四千多人，无固定职业的流动人口达一万多人。据初略估计，城镇行政机关和工矿企业单位，携带家属的职工已占到60％至70％，甚至有达到80％的。由于户口管理不严，虚报人口、黑人黑户、冒名顶替而得到粮食供应的现象也普遍。如阳泉市虚报和供应证不符的占到供应人口的4.8％。
    城镇人口急剧增加，不仅减少了农村劳力影响生产，而且使城镇的粮食供应日趋紧张。比如，1953年，国家固定供应全省城镇的粮食为十亿斤，到1956——1957年度，增加到十五亿六千万斤。为此，中共山西省委及省人民委员会，已决定压缩城镇中的现有非生产人口，动员他们回乡生产。
    压缩城镇人口的主要对象，是住在城市而没有固定职业的人，和有劳动力的职工家属，以及在农村有扶养条件的人。
