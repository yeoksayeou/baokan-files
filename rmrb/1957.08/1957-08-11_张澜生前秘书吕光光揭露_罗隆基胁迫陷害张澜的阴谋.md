Lü Guangguang, Zhang Lan's Former Secretary, Reveals
Luo Longji's Conspiracy to Coerce and Frame Zhang Lan

In his speech, Lü Guangguang said that after liberation, I served as Secretary to Chairman Zhang Lan. Chairman Zhang spoke to me about many things that happened before liberation. Therefore, after hearing Luo Longji's wanton slander against Chairman Zhang during this anti-Rightist struggle, I felt extremely indignant! Luo Longji thought that Chairman Zhang was dead and could not testify, so he could slander him at will. However, as Chairman Zhang's former secretary, I have a responsibility to expose Luo Longji's slanders and rumors against Chairman Zhang.

Chairman Zhang told me that in the winter of 1947, after the China Democratic League was declared an "illegal organization" by the Chiang Kai-shek government, Chairman Zhang was immediately placed under close surveillance by Kuomintang secret agents in Shanghai and lost his freedom. At this time, Luo Longji was taken by the Kuomintang reactionaries to the famous Hongqiao Sanatorium in Shanghai to "recuperate," and was given a special car for visiting friends, strolling on the streets, going to shopping malls, and going anywhere he pleased. From this, we can see what Luo Longji meant by "sharing weal and woe" with Chairman Zhang in Shanghai.

Obstructing Zhang Lan from Remitting Money to Support the China Democratic League Central Committee in Hong Kong Before Liberation

In the spring of 1948, under the leadership of Comrade Shen Junru, the China Democratic League Central Committee held the Third Plenary Session in Hong Kong. The meeting decided that the China Democratic League would cooperate with the Chinese Communist Party to oppose U.S. imperialism's aid to Chiang in invading China and support land reform. Chairman Zhang, who was trapped in Shanghai, learned of these correct decisions and immediately wrote to Comrade Zhou Xinmin in Hong Kong, expressing that although he could not go to Hong Kong, he was very concerned about the work of the China Democratic League Central Committee and was willing to remit 500 Hong Kong dollars per month as funds for the China Democratic League to carry out democratic activities in Hong Kong. However, when Luo Longji learned that Chairman Zhang was providing assistance to the China Democratic League in Hong Kong, he actually warned Chairman Zhang, "They've already run away, why bother with them!" Chairman Zhang was very dissatisfied with Luo Longji's obstruction. When he later told me about this, he said with great indignation, "Luo Longji wanted to oppose the Third Plenary Session and oppose the China Democratic League following the Communist Party, and even interfered with my remittance to Hong Kong for support!"

Colluding with Secret Agents to Monitor and Prevent Zhang Lan from Going to the Liberated Areas

At the end of 1948, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in order to protect Chairman Zhang's safety, instructed the underground organization in Shanghai at that time to spare no effort to rescue Chairman Zhang from danger. Chairman Zhang also decided to go to Hong Kong and then to the Northeast Liberated Area. However, when Chairman Zhang informed Luo Longji of this confidential matter, Luo Longji told Chairman Zhang with ulterior motives, "You are a person of high moral standing and prestige, and the Kuomintang cannot do anything to you. People like me who show their faces are in greater danger. I'm not leaving, so why should you?" He even threatened Chairman Zhang, saying, "The Kuomintang secret agents are monitoring you so closely, you won't be able to leave even if you want to!"

Immediately afterward, Luo Longji took advantage of Chairman Zhang's toothache to pull Chairman Zhang into the Hongqiao Sanatorium and prevent him from being discharged. The Kuomintang secret agents monitoring Chairman Zhang also greatly increased. Chairman Zhang's request to take a walk in the fields of Xujiahui near the sanatorium was followed by many secret agents, and he was even refused permission to go out for a walk. Chairman Zhang once told me personally: When Luo Longji learned of his decision to leave, why did he pull him into the sanatorium and prevent him from being discharged? Why did the secret agents monitoring him increase and become more vigilant? Chairman Zhang never understood this matter. However, at the previous symposium, Luo Longji again distorted the facts and said that he wanted to go to the Liberated Area at that time, but because Chairman Zhang was in Shanghai, it affected his failure to go to the Liberated Area. Another monstrous lie! Did Luo Longji collude with Kuomintang secret agents at that time, intentionally preventing Chairman Zhang from going to the Liberated Area? Luo Longji should explain this now.

After liberation, Chairman Zhang served as Vice Chairman of the Central People's Government. Luo Longji vainly attempted to use Chairman Zhang's lofty position to continue engaging in anti-Communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist activities. During this period, I witnessed and heard Luo Longji's conspiracy to coerce and frame Chairman Zhang, and I am now willing to testify.

Coercing Zhang Lan, Attempting to Use Zhang Lan's Name to Shield Kuomintang Secret Agents

On the eve of the liberation of Shanghai, the underground organization of the Chinese Communist Party, in order to rescue Chairman Zhang and Luo Longji from danger, instigated Yan Jinwen, the secret agent responsible for monitoring Chairman Zhang, to transfer Chairman Zhang and Luo Longji to a safe place. From then on, Luo Longji regarded Yan Jinwen as his "benefactor." Therefore, Luo Longji insisted on introducing Yan Jinwen to join the China Democratic League, asking Chairman Zhang and himself to be the introducers, and even said to Chairman Zhang, "Only you and I understand Yan Jinwen, so we should be the natural introducers." Later, the China Democratic League organization and Chairman Zhang resolutely refused. Then, Luo Longji wanted to place Yan Jinwen in the Dahua Rubber Factory in Tianjin, further coercing Chairman Zhang to jointly write a letter with Luo Longji himself to Li Lisan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions at that time, to intercede for Yan Jinwen. Luo Longji also wrote a letter to Hong Nianzu, the capitalist responsible for the Dahua Rubber Factory, asking Hong Nianzu to fight for Yan Jinwen's position in the factory with the public representative, and asking Chairman Zhang to sign the letter. After Chairman Zhang refused to sign, Luo Longji actually said, "If you don't sign, I, as a member of the Government Affairs Council (Luo was a member of the Government Affairs Council at that time), can still send this letter." Chairman Zhang said indignantly, "My life was saved by the Communist Party, not by secret agents!" However, Luo Longji always regarded Yan Jinwen, who had served as a Kuomintang secret agent, as his savior, and never admitted that it was the Chinese Communist Party who saved him.

Pulling Zhang Lan to Lobby for Zhang Dongsun, and Cursing Him After Being Rejected

During the "Three-Anti" movement in 1952, Zhang Dongsun's treasonous crimes were exposed. Before this, Luo Longji had been claiming illness and recuperating in the Summer Palace, and even did not attend the Government Affairs Council meetings related to major national affairs. However, when Zhang Dongsun's treason case was revealed, Luo Longji ran around for Zhang Dongsun day and night. Luo Longji said to Chairman Zhang, "Exposing Zhang Dongsun is factionalism within the League." He asked Chairman Zhang to come forward and speak for Zhang Dongsun. When Chairman Zhang sternly rejected Luo Longji's arrogant request, Luo Longji actually slandered Chairman Zhang to his face for "not speaking fairly." Luo Longji wanted me to speak for a traitor. I really don't know what position he wanted to put me in!

In the winter of 1954, when the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) was nominated, Luo Longji asked Chairman Zhang to nominate his confidant Peng Wenyin as a CPPCC member on behalf of the China Democratic League, and said to Chairman Zhang, "If I nominate Peng Wenyin, everyone will oppose it; if you nominate him, everyone will have no objection." After Chairman Zhang rejected Luo Longji's request, according to Pu Xixiu's recent exposure, Luo Longji actually scolded Chairman Zhang behind his back as an old and cunning fox.

The facts are so obvious: Luo Longji has always been anti-Communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist. Luo Longji not only engaged in anti-Communist and anti-socialist activities, but also tried every means to drag Chairman Zhang onto the wrong path. Luo Longji thought that Chairman Zhang was dead and dared to slander Chairman Zhang recklessly. However, Chairman Zhang is dead, but I am still alive. I vow to fight to the end against Luo Longji's anti-Communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist crimes!

### 张澜生前秘书吕光光揭露  罗隆基胁迫陷害张澜的阴谋

    张澜生前秘书吕光光揭露
    罗隆基胁迫陷害张澜的阴谋
    吕光光发言说，解放后，我担任了张澜主席的秘书，张主席和我谈了不少解放前的事情。因此，我听了罗隆基在这次反右派斗争中肆意对于张主席进行诬蔑，感到无比愤慨！罗隆基以为张主席死无对证了，可以听任罗隆基的诬蔑，但是，作为张主席生前的秘书的我，有责任来揭穿罗隆基对张主席的诬蔑和造谣。
    张主席告诉我，1947年冬，民盟被蒋介石政府宣布“非法组织”后，张主席随即在上海受到国民党特务严密监视，失去自由。这时罗隆基却被国民党反动派接到上海著名的疗养院虹桥疗养院去“休养”，并且拨予特用的小汽车供他访朋友、逛马路、串商场，去他高兴去的任何地方。从这里可以看出罗隆基所谓同张主席在上海“共患难”是怎么回事了。
    阻挠张澜汇款接济解放前在香港的民盟中央
    1948年春，民盟中央在沈钧儒同志的领导下，在香港召开了三中全会。会议决定民盟和中国共产党合作，反对美帝援蒋侵华，拥护土地改革。陷身上海的张主席知道了这些正确的决定后，立刻写信给香港的周新民同志，表示他虽然不能去香港，但十分关怀民盟中央的工作，愿意按月汇寄五百元港币，作为香港民盟开展民主活动的经费。可是罗隆基知道张主席对香港民盟有所接济的时候，竟然警告张主席说：“他们跑都跑了，还管他们干什么！”张主席很不满意罗隆基的这种阻挠。后来告诉我这件事情时，他还非常气忿地说：“罗隆基要反对三中全会，反对民盟跟着共产党走，竟干涉起我汇款到香港去接济的事了！”
    勾结特务监视、阻止张澜去解放区
    1948年底，中国共产党中央为了保护张主席的安全，曾经指示当时在上海的地下组织，不惜任何代价，竭力营救张主席出险。张主席也决计出走香港转赴东北解放区。但是，当张主席将这一机密事件告知罗隆基时，罗隆基却别有用心地对张主席说：“你是德高望重的人，国民党是奈何你不得的，像我这样抛头露面的人，危险性更大。我都不走，你又何必走呢？”甚至恐吓张主席说：“国民党特务监视得这么严密，你要走也是走不掉的”！
    紧接着，罗隆基就利用张主席牙痛医牙的机会，索性把张主席拉进了虹桥疗养院，不让张主席出院。监视张主席的国民党特务，也就大大增多。张主席要求到疗养院附近的徐家汇田野里去散步，都有特务多人尾随着，甚至拒绝张主席外出散步。张主席曾经向我亲口说：当罗隆基知道他决计出走的机密后，为什么竟把他拉进疗养院而不让出院？为什么监视他的特务也就增多了，而且更加严密了？张主席对于这件事情，始终是想不通的。然而，在前次的座谈会上，罗隆基又颠倒黑白地说什么当年他要到解放区去，因为张主席在上海也就影响了他没有到解放区去。又是一个弥天大谎！罗隆基在当时是不是勾结了国民党特务，有意阻止张主席去解放区，罗隆基现在应该交代。
    解放以后，张主席担任了中央人民政府副主席职务，罗隆基妄图利用张主席的崇高地位，继续进行反共、反人民、反社会主义的勾当。在这一段时期里，罗隆基胁迫陷害张主席的阴谋活动，我都是在场目见耳闻的，我现在愿意负责作证。
    胁迫张澜，企图借张澜名义包庇国民党特务
    上海解放前夕，中国共产党的地下组织为了抢救张主席和罗隆基出险，策动当时负责监视张主席的特务阎锦文，将张主席和罗隆基转移到安全地方，从此罗隆基就把阎锦文尊为“恩人”。于是罗隆基坚持要介绍阎锦文加入民盟，要求张主席和他一道作介绍人，甚至对张主席说：“只有我和你了解阎锦文，应该是当然的介绍人”。后来民盟组织和张主席断然拒绝了。接着罗隆基要把阎锦文安插在天津大中华橡胶厂，进一步要挟张主席，联同罗隆基本人写信给当时全国总工会李立三副主席，代阎锦文关说。罗隆基还写信给大中华橡胶厂资方负责人洪念祖，要求洪念祖向公方代表为阎锦文争取在该厂的地位，并要求张主席在信上签名。张主席拒绝签名后，罗隆基竟说：“你不签名，我这个政务委员（当时罗是政务院委员）还是发得了这封信的。”张主席愤慨地说：“我这条命是共产党救活的，不是特务救活的！”然而，罗隆基一直把曾经作过国民党特务的阎锦文当作救命恩人，始终不承认是中国共产党救了他。
    拉张澜为张东荪奔走被拒后竟破口大骂
    1952年“三反”运动期间，张东荪的叛国罪行被揭开了。在此以前，罗隆基一直称病在颐和园休养，连关系国家大计的政务院政务会议都不出席。但是，当张东荪的叛国案揭开，罗隆基竟为张东荪日夜奔走。罗隆基对张主席说：“揭开张东荪，是盟内搞宗派。他要求张主席出面，为张东荪说项。当张主席严正拒绝罗隆基的狂妄要求后，罗隆基竟当面诋毁张主席“不说公道话”，罗隆基要我替卖国贼说话真不知道他要把我陷于什么地位了！
    1954年冬，政协全国委员会第二届委员提名时，罗隆基要求张主席提出他的心腹彭文应作为民盟方面的政协委员，并对张主席说：“我提彭文应出来，大家都会反对的；你来提，大家就不会有意见了。”张主席拒绝了罗隆基的这个要求后，据最近浦熙修的揭发，罗隆基竟因此在背后辱骂张主席是老奸巨滑。
    事实就是这样的明显：罗隆基是一贯反共、反人民、反社会主义的。罗隆基不但干了反共反社会主义的勾当，还千方百计地要把张主席也拉到邪路上去。罗隆基以为张主席死了，敢于胆大妄为地诬蔑张主席。但是，张主席死了我还活着，我誓与罗隆基的反共反人民、反社会主义罪行斗争到底！
