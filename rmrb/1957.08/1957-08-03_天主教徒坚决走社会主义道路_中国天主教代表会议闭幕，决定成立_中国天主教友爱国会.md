Xinhua News Agency, 2nd: The Chinese Catholic Representatives' Meeting concluded this morning. The "Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association" was established at the meeting, and a resolution was passed to further carry out the anti-imperialist patriotic movement.

This meeting began on July 15th, with a total of 241 representatives attending (4 excused due to illness or other matters). They came from more than 100 dioceses in 26 provinces (autonomous regions) and cities across the country, representing more than three million Catholics.

The meeting summarized the achievements and experiences of the Chinese Catholic anti-imperialist patriotic movement over the past few years. The representatives also studied Chairman Mao Zedong's speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report at the Fourth Session of the National People's Congress. In the spirit of knowing everything and saying everything, after heated discussions, the representatives reached a consensus on several major issues such as taking the socialist road, anti-imperialism and patriotism, and the relationship between the Chinese Catholic Church and the Vatican.

The meeting held that Chinese Catholics should carry forward the spirit of patriotism, actively participate in the socialist construction of the motherland and various patriotic movements, defend world peace, and assist the government in implementing the policy of freedom of religious belief. The "Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association" was officially established at the meeting, and 150 members were elected, including one archbishop and ten bishops. The meeting also passed the Constitution of the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association.

At today's meeting, the report on "The Situation of the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Movement and Future Tasks" and a resolution of the conference were adopted. The resolution emphasized that the Chinese Catholic Church must implement independence and autonomy, and run the church by the Chinese clergy and believers themselves, completely severing political and economic ties with the Vatican, and resolutely opposing any conspiracies by the Vatican to use religion to interfere in our country's internal affairs, infringe upon our country's sovereignty, and undermine our just anti-imperialist patriotic movement.

Archbishop Pi Shushi of the Shenyang Archdiocese delivered a closing speech to the conference on behalf of the Presidium at today's meeting. Pi Shushi pointed out that the Chinese Catholic Church must take the road of independence and autonomy, and be run by the Chinese clergy and believers themselves. Now the representatives all realize that our country is currently an independent and great socialist country, but the colonial status that old China brought to our Chinese Catholic Church is completely incompatible with our country's independent status. The Chinese Catholic Church must get rid of imperialist control, reject the Vatican's unreasonable interference, and run the church independently and autonomously.

Finally, Pi Shushi hoped that the representatives would convey the resolutions and spirit of this meeting to the three million clergy and believers across the country, and lead all the clergy and believers with their practical actions, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, to actively contribute to socialist construction.

During the meeting, Xi Zhongxun, Secretary-General of the State Council, and He Chengxiang, Director of the Religious Affairs Bureau of the State Council, were invited to speak at the meeting.

    天主教徒坚决走社会主义道路
    中国天主教代表会议闭幕，决定成立“中国天主教友爱国会”
    新华社2日讯　中国天主教代表会议今天上午闭幕。会上成立了“中国天主教友爱国会”，并通过了进一步开展反帝爱国运动的决议。
    这次会议从7月15日开始，出席的代表共二百四十一名（因病因事请假四人），他们来自全国二十六个省（自治区）、市的一百多个教区，代表着三百多万天主教徒。
    会议总结了几年来中国天主教徒反帝爱国运动的成绩和经验。代表们还学习了毛泽东主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲话和周恩来总理在全国人民代表大会第四次会议上作的政府工作报告。代表们本着知无不言、言无不尽的精神，经过热烈讨论，对于走社会主义道路、反帝爱国、中国天主教与梵蒂冈教廷的关系等若干重大原则问题，取得了一致的认识。
    会议认为，中国天主教徒应该发扬爱国主义精神，积极参加祖国社会主义建设和各项爱国运动，保卫世界和平，并协助政府贯彻宗教信仰自由政策。会上正式成立了“中国天主教友爱国会”，选出一百五十名委员，其中包括一名总主教和十名主教。会议还通过了中国天主教友爱国会章程。
    在今天的会议上，通过了“中国天主教友爱国运动情况和今后任务”的报告和大会的一项决议。决议中强调提出中国天主教会必须实行独立自主，由中国神长教友自己来办教会，彻底割断同梵蒂冈在政治上、经济上的联系，坚决反对梵蒂冈教廷利用宗教干涉我国内政、侵犯我国主权、破坏我们正义的反帝爱国运动的任何阴谋活动。
    沈阳总主教区总主教皮漱石在今天的会议上代表主席团向大会致闭幕词。皮漱石指出，中国天主教必须走独立自主、由中国神长教友自办的道路。现在代表们都认识到，目前我们的国家是一个独立的、伟大的社会主义国家，但是，旧中国带给我们中国天主教会的殖民地状态，是与我们国家的独立地位完全不相称的。中国天主教必须摆脱帝国主义的控制，拒绝梵蒂冈教廷的无理干涉，独立自主地自办教会。
    最后，皮漱石希望代表们把这次会议的决议和精神传达给全国三百万神长教友，并以自己的实际行动在共产党和人民政府的领导下，带动全体神长教友，积极为社会主义建设贡献力量。
    在会议期间，国务院秘书长习仲勋和国务院宗教事务局局长何成湘曾应邀到会讲话。
