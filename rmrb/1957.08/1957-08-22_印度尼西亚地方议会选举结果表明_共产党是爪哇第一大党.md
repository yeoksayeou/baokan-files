Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 21st: The Indonesian "People's Daily" said today that based on the provisional figures of the local council election results already obtained from the provinces of Java, it can be concluded that the Indonesian Communist Party will rank first in the local council elections throughout Java, that is, become the largest party in Java.

The newspaper said that the Indonesian Communist Party won three million votes each in East Java and Central Java provinces, totaling six million votes. The Yogyakarta Special Region in Central Java, where elections have not yet been held, is only estimated to have the same number of votes as in the Constituent Assembly election. If the votes obtained in Jakarta and West Java provinces are added, the Indonesian Communist Party has obtained more than seven million votes in Java as a whole, an increase of one million votes compared with the total number of votes obtained in the country in the last general election. It is estimated that the number of votes obtained by other parties in Java will not exceed this number.

Referring to the East Java Provincial Election Committee's sudden announcement that the local elections were invalid and its decision to hold new elections, the newspaper said that the East Java Election Committee's decision was illegal.

　  印度尼西亚地方议会选举结果表明
　　共产党是爪哇第一大党
    据新华社雅加达21日电　印度尼西亚“人民日报”今天说，根据目前已经得到的爪哇各省地方议会选举结果的临时数字可以作出结论：印度尼西亚共产党将在爪哇全境的地方议会选举中占第一位，即成为爪哇全境的第一大党。
    这家报纸说，印度尼西亚共产党在东爪哇省和中爪哇省各得三百万票，共六百万票，其中尚未举行选举的中爪哇的日惹特区只是以得票数和制宪议会选举相等来估计的。如果加上在雅加达市和西爪哇省所得的票数，印度尼西亚共产党在爪哇全境总共获得七百万票以上，比上次大选在全国得票的总数增加了一百万票，估计其它政党在爪哇的得票数字不会超过这个数字。
    这家报纸在谈到东爪哇省选举委员会忽然宣布当地的选举无效和决定重新选举的时候说，东爪哇选举委员会的决定是不合法的。
