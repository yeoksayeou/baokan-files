On the Anti-Rightist Struggle Front

    Guangxi Literary and Art Circles Expose a Group of Rightist Elements

    Xinhua News Agency Report: The rightist elements in Guangxi literary and art circles, Hu Ming树 (Deputy Director of the Guangxi Provincial Preparatory Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, Vice Chairman of the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles), Lin Huanping (Member of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, Vice Chairman of the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Director of the Chinese Language Department of Guangxi Teachers College), and Li Wenzhao (Member of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Vice Chairman of the Guilin City Federation of Literary and Art Circles) organized and gathered many anti-Party elements in Guangxi literary and art circles to form an anti-Party clique and launched a major attack on the Party. They used the legal organizations of the democratic parties and the Federation of Literary and Art Circles to launch a frenzied attack on the Party during the period of great airing of views. Hu Ming树 said: "The Communist Party's leadership of literature and art has made literature and art wither and become lifeless!" He advocated: "Bureaucratism must be beaten to death with one blow!" They unscrupulously used various despicable methods to vigorously develop their organization, attempting to "divide the court and contend with courtesy" with the Communist Party.

    A Nineteen-Year Party Member Degenerates into a Rightist Element

    Xinhua News Agency Report: The Second Intermediate Party School of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held continuous meetings to expose and criticize the fallacies of the rightist element Guo Yi within the Party.

    Guo Yi is the director of the library of the Second Intermediate Party School. This rightist element, who often flaunted his nineteen years of Party membership, has completely degenerated and deteriorated. After the 20th Congress of the CPSU and the Hungarian incident, he arrogantly claimed that the Chinese Party must undergo a "thorough transformation." During the great airing of views, he conducted a comprehensive and malicious slander and attack on the Party's leadership and the country's political and economic life. He openly proposed to "abolish the system of principal responsibility under the leadership of the Party committee in universities and the system of factory director responsibility under the leadership of the Party committee in enterprises." Regarding the cadre policy, he advocated, "Now that the history of the vast number of cadres has been clarified, therefore, the use of people can disregard politics." He even fantasized and said, "The Party has been implementing a rash and reckless leftist line in agricultural collectivization and economic construction," and even said that "these serious shortcomings and errors" must be "dug out from the highest leadership." After this extremely reactionary speech was criticized by all faculty, staff, and students, he had to bow his head and admit his mistakes.

    Lu Qinzhi's Reactionary Face is Exposed

    Xinhua News Agency Report: Lu Qinzhi, a backbone member of the Zhang-Luo Alliance, has begun to expose his anti-Soviet and anti-communist face. Lu Qinzhi is an alternate member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League and currently works at Northeast People's University in Changchun. He is an old friend of Luo Longji, and Lu Qinzhi's name is on the list of this clique confessed by Pan Guangdan, Zeng Zhaolun, and Chen Renbing.

    Not long ago, Northeast People's University held a scientific report meeting, and Lu Qinzhi delivered a paper entitled "Changes in the Northeast Border" at the meeting. This paper used reactionary viewpoints of great-power chauvinism and narrow nationalism, fabricated some historical materials related to the era of Tsarist Russia and old China and the modern Sino-Soviet socialist countries, and launched a frenzied attack on socialism, the Soviet Union, and the Chinese Communist Party. He also maliciously slandered Fan Wenlan and Hu Sheng, saying that they deliberately "brushed" away this history when writing books.

    After the criminal activities of the Zhang-Luo Alliance were exposed, Lu Qinzhi went from calmness to panic. He took out a letter written to him by Luo Longji and went to the Jilin Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League to express his intention to confess the criminal activities of the Zhang-Luo Alliance.

    在反右派斗争战线上
    广西文艺界揭露一批右派分子
    本报讯　广西文艺界右派分子胡明树（民进广西省筹委会副主任委员、省文联副主席）、林焕平（民盟广西省委委员、省文联副主席、广西师范学院语文系主任）、李文钊（民革广西省委委员、桂林市文联副主席）组织和拉拢广西文艺界许多反党分子结成反党集团，向党大举进攻。他们利用民主党派和文联的合法组织，在大鸣大放期间，向党进行猖狂进攻。胡明树说：“共产党领导文艺，就使文艺枯萎了，没有生气！”他主张：“官僚主义非一棍子打死不可！”他们不择手段地用各种卑鄙的办法大肆发展组织，企图与共产党“分庭抗礼”。
    十九年的党员蜕化成右派分子
    本报讯　中共中央第二中级党校最近连续集会，揭露和批驳党内右派分子郭仪的谬论。
    郭仪是第二中级党校图书馆主任，这个经常向人炫耀有十九年党龄的右派分子，已经完全蜕化变质。他在苏共二十次代表大会和匈牙利事件后，极端狂妄地声称中国党必须来一个“彻底变革”。在大鸣大放中，他对党的领导、国家的政治、经济生活进行了全面的、恶毒的诬蔑和攻击。他公开提出要“取消高等学校的党委领导下的校长负责制和企业党委领导下的厂长负责制”，关于干部政策他主张“现在广大干部的历史已经弄清，因此用人可以不问政治”。他还异想天开地说“党在农业合作化和经济建设方面一直在执行着急躁冒进的左倾路线”，甚至说“这些严重的缺点和错误”都要从“最高领导去挖”。这种极端反动的言论在受到全体教职学员的批判后，他不得不低头认错。
    陆钦墀的反动面目被揭露
    本报讯　章罗联盟骨干分子陆钦墀的反苏反共面目已经开始暴露。陆钦墀是民盟中央候补委员，现在长春东北人民大学工作。他是罗隆基的老朋友，潘光旦、曾昭抡、陈仁炳交代的这个集团的名单中，都有陆钦墀的名字。
    不久以前，东北人民大学举行了一次科学报告会，陆钦墀在会上发表了一篇题为“东北边界改变”的论文。这篇论文用大国沙文主义和狭隘民族主义的反动观点，捏造了一些有关帝俄和旧中国时代及现代中苏两个社会主义国家的史料，向社会主义、向苏联和中国共产党进行了疯狂的攻击。他还对范文澜和胡绳进行了恶毒的污蔑，说他们写书时有意“刷”去这段历史。
    章罗联盟的罪恶活动被揭露以后，陆钦墀由镇静变为惊慌。他拿出罗隆基写给他的一封信，找民盟吉林省委表示要交代章罗联盟的罪恶活动。
