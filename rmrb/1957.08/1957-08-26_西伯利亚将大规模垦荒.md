Moscow Dispatch from our Newspaper, August 25th: The Soviet Union has raised the issue of further reclaiming wasteland in Siberia. This issue was announced by Belyayev, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, in an article published in yesterday's "Pravda" and today's "Agricultural Newspaper."

He said that reclaiming large areas of new land is the most important marker on our country's road to creating abundant agricultural products. In the past three years, the Soviet Union has reclaimed a total of 36 million hectares of new land.

Belyayev pointed out that the main area for continuing to reclaim virgin land should be Siberia. He said that Siberia has large tracts of land that can be cultivated after reclamation without the need for soil improvement, which is economically very beneficial. Siberia is less threatened by drought than other regions of our country. This large industrial area has a developed road network, which can smoothly solve the problem of grain transportation. It also has a high level of agricultural mechanization.

Belyayev pointed out: According to rough estimates by local organizations, in the southeastern region of the Russian Federation, in the Urals and Siberia, approximately 12 to 15 million hectares of new land can be reclaimed in the next two to three years. If the average yield per hectare is 50 to 60 poods of grain, then the above-mentioned areas can produce another 600 to 900 million poods of grain. This means that the output of marketable grain in the Urals and Siberia can be increased to approximately 2 billion poods, becoming the decisive area for marketable grain in the Soviet Union.

The article concludes by pointing out that Siberia can and should become a large-scale production area for sugar beets, potatoes, and livestock products in the coming years.

　　西伯利亚将大规模垦荒
    本报莫斯科25日电　苏联提出了进一步在西伯利亚开垦荒地的问题，这个问题是苏共中央书记别利亚耶夫在昨天的“真理报”和今天的“农业报”发表的一篇文章中公布的。
    他说，开垦大片新土地是我国创造充裕农产品道路上的最重要的标志。三年来苏联一共开垦了三千六百万公顷的新土地。
    别利亚耶夫指出，继续开垦生荒地的主要地区应该是西伯利亚。他说，西伯利亚有大片在开垦后不需要进行土壤改良就可以耕种的土地，这在经济方面是很有利的。西伯利亚比我国其他地区更少受到旱灾的威胁。这个大工业区有发达的公路网，可以顺利解决粮食运输问题。并且还有着高度农业机械化水平。
    别利亚耶夫指出：据当地组织的大概估计，在俄罗斯联邦的东南地区、在乌拉尔和西伯利亚，最近两三年内大约可以再开垦一千二百到一千五百万公顷的新土地。如果以每公顷平均收获量为五十到六十普特的谷物，那么上述地区就可以再生产六到九亿普特的谷物。这就是说，乌拉尔和西伯利亚的商品谷物的产量就可以增加到大约二十亿普特，而成为苏联商品谷物的决定性地区。
    文章最后指出，西伯利亚可以而且也应该在最近几年内成为甜菜马铃薯以及畜产品的大规模产地。
