    A Young Girl
  　(and another poem)
    Xu Jinggao
    A young girl,
    Secretly found the head of the cooperative:
    "If I come back after graduation,
    Be sure to give me a double-shared plow."
    The head of the cooperative smiled at the girl,
    Patting his own chest and then patting the girl's shoulder,
    The girl flew away contentedly,
    The head of the cooperative's eyes captured her ideal.
    Welcoming the new farmer
    The village is filled with the sound of gongs and drums,
    Full of joy,
    Is it sending a representative to Beijing?
    Is it welcoming a model worker back to their hometown?
    The head of the cooperative tells us:
    It is welcoming new hope,
    New strength,
    A new farmer.

    一个年轻的姑娘
  　（外一首）
    徐竟高
    一个年轻姑娘，
    暗暗找到社长：
    “要是毕业回来了，
    双铧犁一定给我一张。”
    社长笑着对姑娘，
    拍拍自己胸脯又拍拍姑娘肩膀，
    姑娘满意地飞去了，
    社长的眼睛捉回了她的理想。
    是迎接新的庄稼汉
    村庄上锣鼓喧天，
    喜气洋洋，
    是送代表进北京？
    是迎劳模还家乡？
    社长告诉我们：
    是迎接新的希望、
    新的力量、
    新的庄稼汉。
