Li Wujiu "Has Fault" with Socialism
The Wuhan Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the Federation of Industry and Commerce Criticize Him

(Our dispatch) The Wuhan Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce jointly held an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee on July 26 and 27 to continue criticizing the words and deeds of Li Wujiu, a rightist member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association and vice chairman of the Wuhan Municipal Branch. Li Wujiu brushed aside all the fallacies he had spread during the "blooming and contending," as well as a series of conspiracies to slander the government and incite small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen to oppose the leadership of the Party, attributing them to reasons such as the influence of "class sentiments."

In the early days of liberation, Li Wujiu consistently competed with the state-owned economy for the market and was also a "ruthless hand" in resisting taxes and public bonds. He protested repeatedly on taxation matters, appealing from Wuhan to the central government. He once incited the four major public-private joint venture cotton mills in the city to claim difficulties and refuse to purchase public bonds, drafting a petition to the government. He said that subscribing to public bonds was just like the Kuomintang period's apportionment of exorbitant taxes and levies.

At the beginning of the rectification campaign, Li Wujiu collected materials everywhere to attack the Party and the people. He also repeatedly opposed the criticism of Li Kangnian, Wu Jincui, and others' erroneous remarks by Wuhan industrialists and businessmen.

    厉无咎对社会主义“有咎”
    民建武汉市委和市工商联对他进行批判
    本报讯　民建武汉市委会、市工商联于7月26、27日联合举行常委扩大会议，继续批判民建中央委员、武汉市分会副主委厉无咎等右派言行。厉无咎把他在“鸣放”中所散布的谬论，以及诬蔑政府煽动中、小工商业者反对党的领导等一系列阴谋活动，一概轻描淡写地推在由于“阶级感情”作祟等原因上。
    厉无咎解放初期就一贯与国营经济争夺市场，同时是抗拒税收和公债的“狠手”，为了税收问题，他从武汉闹到中央，一再抵抗。他曾煽动全市公私合营的四大纱厂叫喊困难不购公债，由他起草请愿书向政府请愿。他说，认购公债就和国民党时期摊派苛捐杂税一样。
    厉无咎在整风初期，到处搜集材料，向党和人民进攻。他还一再反对武汉工商业者对李康年、吴金萃等人的错误言论的批判。
