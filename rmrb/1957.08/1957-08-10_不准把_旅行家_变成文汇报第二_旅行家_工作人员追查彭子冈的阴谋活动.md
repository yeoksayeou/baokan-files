Xinhua News Agency, August 9th: Peng Zigang, the editor-in-chief of "Traveler" magazine, has been exposed for her conspiracy to usurp "Traveler." Currently, all staff members of "Traveler" magazine are continuing to investigate Peng Zigang regarding this matter.

In order to turn "Traveler" magazine into a stronghold for bourgeois right-wingers to attack the Party and socialism, Peng Zigang has been systematically deploying a series of plans since she took office as the editor-in-chief of "Traveler" magazine in November 1954.

First, Peng Zigang used various excuses and means of exclusion and suppression to drive out cadres who did not suit her. In the past two years, two-thirds of the Communist Party members in the "Traveler" editorial department have been transferred out. The remaining cadres also often suffered cold treatment from this "editor-in-chief." At the same time, Peng Zigang actively engaged in activities, attempting to bring Mei Duo and others into "Traveler" in order to turn "Traveler" into the second "Wenhui Daily." Fortunately, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League did not approve the appointment of these people. Later, the Party sent Bai Huai to serve as the deputy editor-in-chief of "Traveler" magazine. Peng Zigang became suspicious and said that Bai Huai was sent by the Party to monitor her.

Peng Zigang disliked articles by Party member writers and progressive writers such as Tian Jian, Liu Baiyu, Ai Wu, and Hu Ke, saying that every article had to add a line about the Party's leadership, which was boring and tasteless. The contributors she admired were Chu Anping, Fei Xiaotong, Lu Yi, Wu Zuguang, Xiao Qian, and others.

From the very beginning, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League clearly stipulated that the guiding principle and task of "Traveler" magazine was to be a popular geographical knowledge publication, using vivid and graphic geographical knowledge to conduct patriotic and internationalist education among young people. Peng Zigang used her job authority to tamper with this principle, and the reader orientation of "Traveler" magazine gradually changed from "facing the youth" to being divorced from the youth, and turned to "facing a small group of upper and middle-class intellectuals."

Peng Zigang particularly emphasized reflecting the dark side of society in the selection criteria for "Traveler." In this way, "Traveler" magazine's policy of carrying out patriotic education to the youth became slander of the motherland. When Peng Zigang edited and reviewed manuscripts, she often deleted words or paragraphs praising the Party and praising socialism from the original manuscripts. The July issue's "Travel Diary by Highway Bus" described the socialist highway transportation as chaotic and maliciously attacked the People's Liberation Army, provoking relations between the military and the people. However, Peng Zigang was overjoyed when she saw it, and hurriedly instructed it to be placed on the first page, or at least on the second page, and to be arranged in bold type in the table of contents, with satirical paintings inserted in the text. As a result, it was not placed in the first article due to opposition from the staff within the company.

### 不准把“旅行家”变成文汇报第二  “旅行家”工作人员追查彭子冈的阴谋活动

    不准把“旅行家”变成文汇报第二
    “旅行家”工作人员追查彭子冈的阴谋活动
    据新华社9日讯　“旅行家”杂志主编彭子冈企图篡夺“旅行家”的阴谋已被揭露。目前，“旅行家”杂志社全体工作人员正就此事对彭子冈继续进行追查。
    为了把“旅行家”杂志作为资产阶级右派分子向党向社会主义进攻的一个据点，彭子冈自从1954年11月担任“旅行家”杂志主编后，就有计划地进行了一系列的部署。
    首先，彭子冈以种种借口和排斥、打击，把不合她心意的干部赶出“旅行家”。两年多来，“旅行家”编辑部的共产党员就被调出了三分之二。剩下的干部也时时遭到这位“主编”的冷眼。同时彭子冈趁机积极活动，企图把梅朵等人拉进“旅行家”。使“旅行家”变成文汇报第二。幸好团中央没有批准任用这些人。后来，党派白槐来任“旅行家”杂志的副主编，彭子冈又疑神疑鬼地说，白槐是党派来监视她的。
    彭子冈很不喜欢田间、刘白羽、艾芜、胡可等党员作家和进步作家的文章，说什么每篇文章里都要加一条党的领导，枯燥无味。她所推崇的撰稿人是储安平、费孝通、陆诒、吴祖光、萧乾等等。
    “旅行家”杂志从创办的时候起，团中央就明确的规定这个刊物的方针任务是：普通地理知识性刊物，通过生动、形象的地理知识介绍，向青年进行爱国主义和国际主义教育。彭子冈利用她的工作职权篡改了这个方针，“旅行家”杂志的读者方向逐渐从“面向青年”变成了脱离青年，而转为“面向一小部分中上层知识分子”。
    彭子冈在旅行家的选稿标准，特别强调反映出社会的阴暗面。这样一来，“旅行家”杂志向青年进行爱国主义教育的方针就变成了毁谤祖国。彭子冈在编审稿件的时候，常常在原稿上删减歌颂党、歌颂社会主义的字句或段落。今年7月号的“乘公路汽车旅行记”，把社会主义的公路交通描写得混乱不堪，并且恶意地攻击人民解放军，挑拨军民关系，可是，彭子冈见了竟如获至宝，赶忙指令排在第一面，至少也要放在第二面，还要在目录上排黑体字，文内插讽刺画。结果因社内工作人员反对，才没有放在第一篇。
