Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 14th: The Omani Imam's office in Cairo issued a statement on the 13th saying that the Omani people will never surrender.

The statement said that the Omanis are still holding their strongholds, resisting British bombs, rockets, tanks, and thousands of troops.

The statement said: "The Omanis have not surrendered as the British said, nor will they surrender as the British hope."

According to Xinhua News Agency, 13th dispatch from Manama: A British military spokesman admitted on the evening of the 12th that Omani rebels still control Jebel Akhdar, west of the ancient Omani capital of Nizwa. Although the main force of the Omani rebel forces has withdrawn to the mountains, fighting has not stopped in the area centered on Nizwa.

Two British offensive forces joined forces on the 12th in Al-Mawz, northeast of Nizwa, thereby opening the road from Muscat to the Omani oil center of Fuhud.

A British Royal Air Force spokesman in Bahrain on the 12th hinted that some of the grenades and mines found in the rebels' arms depots in Firq and Nizwa were made in the United States.

British newspapers had earlier accused the United States of attempting to profit from the Omani incident through Saudi Arabia.

According to Xinhua News Agency, 14th dispatch from Bahrain: The British Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Burrows, stated at a press conference on the 13th that British troops will continue to attack Omani rebels who have retreated to the mountains together with the Sultan of Muscat's troops.

In order to deal with the pressure of public opinion, Burrows tried his best to promote that the Omani war "is virtually over," and said that the British troops would stay in Oman for "as short a time as possible." But he also said that besieging the Omani rebels who retreated to the mountains would take "a considerable amount of time."

    阿曼教长驻开罗办事处发表声明
    阿曼人民决不投降
    英国官方表示将继续进攻起义者
    新华社开罗14日电　阿曼教长驻开罗办事处13日发表声明说，阿曼人民决不投降。
    声明说，阿曼人仍然在坚守他们的据点，抵挡英国的炸弹、火箭、坦克和成千的军队。
    声明说：“阿曼人并没有如英国所说的那样投降了，而且也不会如英国所希望的那样投降”。
    据新华社13日讯　马纳马消息：英国军方发言人12日晚间承认，阿曼起义者仍旧控制着阿曼古都尼兹瓦以西的贾卜临。目前，阿曼起义者部队的主力虽然已经撤往山区，但是，在以尼兹瓦为中心的地区内，战斗还没有停止。
    两支英国进攻部队12日已经在尼兹瓦东北方的马乌兹会合，由此打通了从马斯喀特到阿曼石油中心法乌德的道路。
    在巴林岛的一个英国皇家空军发言人12日暗示说，在菲尔克和尼兹瓦起义者武器仓库中发现的一些手榴弹和地雷是美国造的。
    英国报纸早些时候曾经指责美国企图通过沙特阿拉伯利用阿曼事件从中渔利。
    据新华社14日讯　巴林消息：英国驻波斯湾国家政治专员伯罗斯13日在记者招待会上表示，英国军队将继续同马斯喀特苏丹军队一起进攻撤往山区的阿曼起义者。
    为了对付舆论压力，伯罗斯竭力宣传阿曼战争“实际上已经结束”，并且说英国军队留在阿曼的“时间将尽可能地短暂”。但是他又说，围攻撤往山区的阿曼起义者需要“相当长的时间”。
