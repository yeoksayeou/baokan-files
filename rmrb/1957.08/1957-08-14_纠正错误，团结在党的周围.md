    Correcting Mistakes, Uniting Around the Party
    Xu Guangping

    As a non-Party member, I had the opportunity to participate in the enlarged meeting of the Party Group of the Chinese Writers Association exposing the Ding-Chen anti-Party clique, which deeply moved and educated me.

    First of all, I saw that under the sincere appeal of the Party in recent days, even Chen Qixia, who was most stubborn and die-hard, finally began to change his long-term denial attitude. At the previous meetings, I saw him using Comrade Liu Xi to do anti-Party work, bullying, suppressing, and using all kinds of conspiracies to deal with a woman. Even though I didn't know her deeply, I couldn't help but feel righteous indignation, and I wanted to slap him a few times to vent my anger. Unexpectedly, he was finally able to more sincerely begin to reveal his long-standing anti-Party situation. Here, I feel the greatness of the Party even more. The Party's gentle and persuasive approach, clarifying the principles, and distinguishing right from wrong is indeed the best way to save those who have made mistakes, and it is worth our careful consideration.

    Secondly, what disappointed us was Comrade Ding Ling. I have known her for more than twenty years since we met. As a reader, I originally liked her works. We were relatively close when I went to the Soviet Union under her leadership. Once, she asked me to give her opinions on her works. I said: The reason I like her works is because they don't have a feminine air. They don't focus on trivial matters, women, and children, but care about everyone's affairs. For example, I was very happy to read the article "Water." This is one aspect. On the other hand, in our contact, she turned my good feelings for her into a lack of understanding. What was going on? She encouraged me to write. This was originally well-intentioned, but then she revealed what was in her heart: "No matter how much work you do now, what does it count for? Writing is for yourself." I was shocked when I heard this. I thought, working for the Party and the people, the leadership teaches us this way, and the leadership considers everyone's work based on a reason. It is always based on what the people need you to do, so why consider "for yourself"? Is "yourself" more important than the people? Based on these two sentences, I began to understand what kind of person Comrade Ding Ling was. It turned out that her writing was for herself, and my previous evaluation of her—caring about everyone's affairs—began to change. Her two sentences are a very good explanation of what some comrades revealed as "one-bookism." These past few days at the conference have made me recall this past situation again, confirming Comrade Ding Ling's self-proclaimed extraordinary and superior airs everywhere, to the point of developing into an anti-Party clique, which is by no means accidental. If she stubbornly resists and refuses to thoroughly repent with the help of the Party and comrades, change those anti-Party crimes that have been lurking in the depths of her soul for a long time, and eradicate her mistakes, then she will be cutting herself off from the people. I used to think she didn't have a feminine air (in fact, a good feminine air is not bad), but judging from her performance at the meeting these past few days, crying, acting coy, quibbling evasively, and pretending to be confused, she has shown a completely bad feminine air. She refuses to lose face, insists on being flattered and praised, and is actually a Yang Yinyu-style [Note] stubborn villain who won't turn back. If this continues, your works will contain poison, and no one will read them. You won't be welcomed even if you think of living by the Sanggan River. Then your political life will be over. However, the Party is most tolerant and able to save people in time. The Party leadership is most able to help people change their mistakes. Comrade Chen Qixia has begun to confess frankly, and the Party is encouraging him and guiding him onto the right path, which is an example. But first of all, you must be willing to admit your mistakes and thoroughly dig up the roots. Aren't our many leading comrades often using themselves as examples to educate everyone? The leading comrades are not afraid of losing face, so do we have any face problems that are more important than the leaders, that we can't let go of? Is your, Ding Ling's, face so special that it needs extra care, always connected to your skin and bones, and can't be torn off?

    What is surprising is that in the Ding-Chen clique incident these past few days, I have heard that there are also acquaintances involved. On the first day, when someone mentioned the name Xuefeng, I asked him directly: "What? Do you have a part in this too?" This sentence shows that I have forgotten history and am too isolated from the literary and art circles. I am an outsider. Ding Ling stubbornly clings to history, saying that she and Comrade Xuefeng were good friends in Shanghai, and because Xuefeng had opinions on Comrade Zhou Yang, she also had opinions on Comrade Zhou Yang (like children quarreling, how can she say such a thing?). It seems like a personal issue. In fact, who doesn't know that it is an attempt to avoid the issue by transferring dissatisfaction with the Party to individuals? Even if we take a step back, society is advancing, and what era is it now? The Party calls on the people to take the socialist road, pass the socialist barrier, and unite all forces that can be united to strive for socialist construction. Everyone's responsibility is not light. But Ding Ling did not see it, did not think about it, and Xuefeng did not see it, nor did he think about it. All they think about and never forget are old scores from twenty or thirty years ago, always calculating them endlessly and reheating cold rice endlessly. Of course, this is not to say that we should sever history, but to hope that we look at history dialectically. Today, society is advancing by leaps and bounds, and they are still shamelessly and openly talking about forming small circles and acting on personal feelings from twenty or thirty years ago. Is this still acceptable? In recent years, I have always heard that Xuefeng is ill and busy, so there has been very little contact. It turns out that he is busy with that set of anti-Party activities, sick with harboring ulterior motives, fabricating facts, and acting like a ghost in broad daylight by placing himself in the dark. In fact, he willingly lags behind the times, willing to abandon himself to the people, and remains at a hateful stage before liberation. As an old friend, I hope they will return to the side of the Party and the people. Everyone is over fifty years old, and should be more mature, discard personal petty schemes, incorporate them into the Party's work, and work hard with loyalty and effort.

    What is annoying is that people are constantly mentioning Lu Xun, saying that at the 20th anniversary of Lu Xun's death last year, seeing Comrade Zhou Yang by his coffin, Lu Xun would have jumped up and punched him if he were still alive. Those who say this probably see a person as unchanged as they were twenty or thirty years ago, someone who wants to settle old scores. Last year, I also went to Shanghai. In my prepared speech, I described Lu Xun as "a Chinese person," and Comrade Zhou Yang suggested changing it to "Lu Xun is not just one of the Chinese people, but the most outstanding and loyal son of the Chinese people." His suggested change is a more accurate evaluation of Lu Xun. He represented the Party in presiding over Lu Xun's memorial work with great enthusiasm, and the inscription on Lu Xun's tombstone was also written by the Chairman at his request. We can see from this that Comrade Zhou Yang is representing the Party's identity and dealing with problems with a serious attitude. If we can all be loyal to the organization and the Party, treating matters objectively and not personally, our views will naturally be different.

    I sincerely hope that after this rectification campaign, the literary and art circles will achieve a new unity from unity and struggle. Let us all rise up and support the Party's rectification campaign, and immerse ourselves in this great torrent to cleanse ourselves! The literary and art circles must correct the phenomenon of disunity in order to move forward. The rapid advance of society is pushing us, and we can no longer hesitate. Saving ourselves and helping others is everyone's responsibility, please do not believe the words of those who sow discord. Now many people always push many things onto Lu Xun. The rightist Lin Xiling said, "If Lu Xun had proposed Hu Feng's program, ... it would not have been counter-revolutionary." Those are reactionary words. I dare to assert that Lu Xun, who was loyal to the Party and the people all his life, would never be and would never be willing to be reactionary. If he were alive today, he would despise counter-revolutionaries and anti-Party elements. Obeying the Party's decisions is what Lu Xun believed should be followed in organizational discipline. Reactionaries must never use Lu Xun as a shield. The anti-Japanese national united front that Lu Xun agreed to publish before his death, calling on everyone to unite around the Party, doesn't that clearly show his attitude? Why do you still want to use Lu Xun as a talisman to say so many divisive things against the Party? Please wake up quickly, this is the only way to save yourselves and love yourselves, and not cut yourselves off from the Party and the people!

    [Note] Yang Yinyu sometimes resembles a fierce beast, sometimes pretends to be a sheep, insists on mistakes, stubbornly refuses to change, engages in activities everywhere, opposes progress, forms cliques for private gain, is self-righteous, and is finally abandoned by the people, taking the road to self-destruction.

    纠正错误，团结在党的周围
    许广平
    作为一个党外群众，有机会参加中国作家协会党组揭发丁、陈反党集团的扩大会议，使我深深受到感动和教育。
    首先：看到几天来在党的真诚感召下，就是最顽强死硬如陈企霞同志的长期抵赖态度，也终于开始转变。在前几次会议上，看到他利用柳溪同志做反党工作，欺负、压制、用尽阴谋狡计对付一个女性，就是我了解不深，也禁捺不住义愤，恨不得起来劈他几个巴掌泄泄愤气；却不料他终于能比较诚恳地开始吐露出多时的反党情况。在此，我更感到党的伟大。党的和风细雨，说清道理，辨明是非的处理问题，的确是挽救犯了错误的人的最好办法，值得我们仔细体味的。
    其次，使我们感到失望的是丁玲同志。从见面认识到现在，也有二十多年了，作为一个读者，我原是爱好她的作品的。比较接近多些是在她领导下出国到苏联去，有一次她要我对她的作品提意见，我说：我之所以喜欢她的作品，是因为没有女人气，并不是专写身边琐事、妇女、儿童，而是关心大家的事，如“水”的一篇，我就读了很高兴，这是一方面。另一方面，在接触中她又把我对她的好感变为不了解了。这是什么一回事呢？是她劝我写东西。这原是好意的，但接着她说出她心里的话来了：“你现在不管做多少工作都算得什么呢？写东西才是自己的。”当时我听了震动一下，我想，为党为人民做工作，领导是这样教导我们，领导上考虑每个人的工作，不是没有根据的，总是人民需要你做什么，就让你做什么，为什么要考虑“是自己”的呢，难道自己比人民大众更重要些吗？凭这两句话，我开始体会了丁玲同志是个什么样的人了，原来她的写作是为自己的，我原先对她的评价——关心大家的事——开始有了不同。她的这两句话，就是有些同志揭发的“一本书主义”的很好的解释。从这几天的大会使我又回忆到过去这一段情况，印证一下丁玲同志的到处自命不凡、高人一等的气焰，以至发展成为反党集团，绝不是偶然的了。如果她顽抗到底，不肯在党和同志们的帮助下彻底悔悟，改变那些长期埋伏在灵魂深处的反党罪行，根除错误，就是自绝于人民。我过去以为她没有女人气（其实好的女人气也并不坏），从她这几天在会上的表现看来，哭哭啼啼，忸忸怩怩，狡赖诡辩，假装胡涂，表现了是十足的坏女人气。不肯撕下面子，一味要人奉承称赞，其实是杨荫榆式的死不回头的坏蛋。〔注〕这样下去，你的作品包含着毒素，是不会有人看的，你想到桑干河边住下也是不会被人欢迎的。那时你的政治生命也就完了。然而党是最宽容人的，也是最能及时挽救人的，党的领导是最能帮助人改变错误的，眼前陈企霞同志开始坦白交代了，党就鼓励他，引向正路去，就是例子。但首先还是要自己肯承认错误，彻底挖根。我们的许多领导同志不是经常谆谆拿自己为例，来教育我们大家吗？领导同志都不怕丢面子，难道我们还有什么面子问题比领导更重要，丢不下的呢？难道你丁玲的面子就特别些，要格外照顾，永远和皮骨相连，揭不下来的吗？
    可惊讶的是这几天来听到关于丁陈集团事件中还有熟人在内。头一天听到有人提及雪峰的名字，我那时就当面问：“怎么？也有你一份呢？”这句话，说明我忘记历史，和文艺界方面也太隔膜了，是一个门外汉的话。丁玲就死抱住历史，她说在上海就和雪峰同志要好，因为雪峰对周扬同志有意见，所以她也对周扬同志有意见（像小孩们吵架的话，亏她说得出口），这仿佛是个人问题了。其实谁不知道是把对党的不满转拉到个人身上来企图回避问题呢，就是退一千步说，社会在前进，现在是什么时代呀！党号召人民走社会主义道路，过社会主义关，号召人民团结一切可以团结的力量，为社会主义建设而奋斗，每个人的责任是不轻的。而丁玲没有看见，没有想念，雪峰没有看见，也没有想念。所想念不忘的无非是死缠住二、三十年前的陈年旧账，老是算个不清，冷饭炒个不完。这样说，当然不是叫我们割断历史，只是希望我们辩证地看待历史罢了。今天，社会在一日千里地前进，自己还是不知羞耻地公然说出那样二三十年前搞小圈子，闹个人意气的话，还行得通吗？近年我总听说雪峰多病，忙，所以绝少来往。原来他忙的是那一套反党勾当，病的是心怀鬼胎，捏造事实，无中生有地白日见鬼似地自处于阴暗，其实是自己甘心落后于时代，愿意自弃于人民，停留在解放前的一个可痛恨的阶段了。我以老朋友的资格，希望他们回到党和人民这方面来。大家都过五十岁了，应该成熟些，把个人的龌龊企图丢掉，纳入党的工作范围内，搞好团结，忠诚努力地去干。
    很可恼的是还不断有人提起鲁迅，说去年鲁迅逝世二十周年纪念，看到灵旁有周扬同志，如鲁迅还活着，或者会跳起来揍他。说这话的大约也是把一个人看成二、三十年前一样一成不变，要算陈年旧账的一位人物。去年，我同时也到上海的，我在预拟的发言中把鲁迅说成“作为一个中国人民”，周扬同志建议改为“鲁迅不只是中国人民当中的一个，而是中国人民最优秀最忠实的儿子”。他建议改的这句话，是对鲁迅有较正确的评价。他代表党主持鲁迅纪念工作，非常热诚，鲁迅墓碑上的题字，也是他请主席写的。我们从这里可以看到，周扬同志是代表党的身份，是以严肃的态度处理问题的。如果我们都能对事不对人，对组织对党忠诚的话，看问题自然也会两样了。
    我衷诚希望，经过这次整风，文艺界从团结、斗争达到新的团结。让我们大家起来拥护党的整风，好好转入到这个大洪流中，洗刷自己吧！文艺界必须纠正不团结的现象，才能推向前进。社会前进的迅速，推动我们，再不能迟疑了，挽救自己，帮助别人，大家都有责任，请勿相信挑拨者的话。现在有许多人把许多事总推到鲁迅头上，右派分子林希翎说“胡风的纲领，……若是鲁迅提出来，就更不是反革命了。”那些都是反动的话。我敢断定毕生忠于党和人民的鲁迅绝不会也必不肯反动的。他活到现在的话，他会唾弃反革命、反党的人的。服从党的决定，这就是鲁迅认为应遵守的组织纪律，反动者绝不能拿鲁迅作为挡箭牌的。鲁迅临死前同意发表的抗日民族统一战线，号召大家团结在党的周围，不是很明显说明他的态度吗？为何还要把许多分裂党的话想拿鲁迅来作护符呢。请自己从速醒过来，才是自救自爱，而不是自绝于党和人民的唯一道路！
   〔注〕杨荫榆有时似凶兽，有时装羊，坚持错误，顽强不变，四出活动，反对进步，结党营私，自以为是，终于被人民唾弃，走向自取灭亡的道路。
