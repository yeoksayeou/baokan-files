    Students Enjoy a Happy Summer Vacation
    (Our dispatch) During the summer vacation, the Communist Youth League organizations and educational administrative organs in various regions organized a rich and colorful array of activities beneficial to the physical and mental health of primary and secondary school students. The vast number of primary and secondary school students are joyfully spending their summer vacation.
    Beijing organizes "Summer Vacation Children's Special" movie screenings for primary and secondary school students every day. The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League has established a travel station specifically for receiving children from urban areas to visit the suburbs, or children from suburban areas to visit and tour the city, providing them with rest and accommodation. The Beijing Children's Palace and the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions have established summer camps in the Working People's Cultural Palace, Yuyuantan, and other scenic spots. Currently, five to six thousand young people are happily spending their summer vacation here. The China Opera School, the War Zone Cultural Troupe, the China Acrobatic Troupe, and the Acrobatic Arts Troupe of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are staging more than forty performances of Peking Opera, acrobatics, puppet shows, shadow plays, and song and dance for young people in fourteen theaters. During the summer vacation, Shanghai organized primary and secondary school students to participate in outdoor camping and national defense sports activities. The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Children's Palace also organized students to hike to Wuxi. Public stadiums, swimming pools, and shooting ranges have scheduled activity times for students every day. Each primary and secondary school in Xi'an has established more than ten summer camps or clubs in scenic areas such as Mount Hua and Baqiao, where tens of thousands of young people are happily spending their summer vacation. The Little Red Flower Dance Troupe, the Little Partner Drama Troupe, and the Young Pioneer Choir, formed by schools in the city, also perform for workers and peasants. Nanjing, Wuhan, and other places have also organized summer camps, camping, and other activities.
    During the summer vacation, many regions held science lectures and exhibitions for young people, enriching their knowledge. The Shanghai Youth Palace and Children's Palace held astronomical exhibitions, Earth Physics Year parties, and student sports history exhibitions, while also holding literary gatherings, reading tutoring lectures, dance training classes, and music conducting classes. The Beijing Children's Science and Technology Museum has already held science lectures on ships, airplanes, and semiconductors, and will also prepare to hold science lectures on internal combustion engines, the universe, etc. Children can also observe the moon and participate in star gazing parties here.
    Many places also organized primary and secondary school students to participate in voluntary labor in rural areas (or service industries). As of early August, more than 15,000 middle school students in Shanghai have gone to the suburbs in batches to help farmers with voluntary labor. More than 10,000 middle school students in Tianjin are also serving as attendants on trams, in stores, etc. Participating in labor not only enriched their summer vacation life but also gave students labor training.
