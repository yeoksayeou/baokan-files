Xinhua News Agency, August 23rd dispatch from New York: The "New York Post" recently published six articles in a row titled "Ike and His Money." These articles stated:

　　The American president's "perks" have increased alarmingly in recent years. Only Texas oil tycoons can afford all the equipment Eisenhower possesses in America.

　　Eisenhower owns: a "flying squadron" solely for the president's use; a large motorcade composed of temperature-controlled sedans and other vehicles of various types; a private naval cabin yacht; a residence in downtown Washington occupying thirteen acres—the White House, which has been renovated for $5 million to modernize it; and a villa in the mountains. Maintaining these facilities requires hundreds of employees.

　　The biggest expansion of these "perks" during the Eisenhower administration has been the President's Air Force squadron. It now includes five aircraft under the command of Air Force Colonel Howard Kundler. The first to appear was the Super Constellation Columbine III, a comfortable four-engine transport plane worth approximately $2 million, with thousands of dollars worth of other special equipment inside. The Columbine alone costs more than $100,000 annually in personnel expenses.

　　The White House motorcade has more than forty cars and trucks. When the president travels domestically by plane, at least one car follows him. He also has a private railroad car.

　　Eisenhower receives $50,000 for his personal expenses in addition to his $100,000 annual salary. However, many of his expenses are paid by the government. The total expenses of the White House are $2.4 million, of which $400,000 is used to hire personnel and maintain the grounds. In addition to the White House administrative officials and clerical staff, the residence has seventy-two employees. Domestic staff includes a superintendent, butler, steward, chef, attendant, gatekeeper, manservant, head of laundry, dining room manager, and maid, totaling thirty-seven people. The average salary is $3,290 per person per year.

　　Other employees include a chief technician and assistants, carpenters, painters, electricians, aluminum pipe workers, gardeners, warehouse managers, and clerks, totaling thirty-five people. The average salary is $4,244 per person per year. In addition to the White House, the President also has "Camp David," a villa in the mountains about seventy miles from Washington.

　　Since Eisenhower and his wife moved into the White House, tax-free gifts worth tens of thousands of dollars have poured in. The Gettysburg farm alone was estimated to have received $40,000 worth of gifts eighteen months ago, along with a constant stream of various plants, animals, and furniture.

　　艾森豪威尔家财万贯仆从如云
    官邸、别墅、飞机、游艇、汽车一应俱全
    管家、守门、随从、仆人、园丁数以百计
    据新华社23日讯　纽约消息：“纽约邮报”不久以前以“艾克和他的钱”为题连续登载了六篇文章。这些文章说：
    美国总统的“额外收益”近年来是惊人地增加了。艾森豪威尔拥有的全副设备，在美国只有得克萨斯州的石油富豪才能负担得起。
    艾森豪威尔拥有：一支完全属于总统享用的“飞行队”；一个由能调节气温的轿车及其他各色车辆组成的大汽车队；一只私人的海军船舱游艇；一处座落在华盛顿市区占地十三英亩的官邸——白宫，这所房子曾用五百万美元修缮，使之现代化；一座在山上的别墅。为了维持这些设备，需要好几百个雇员。
    在艾森豪威尔政府任内，这些“额外收益”最大的一次扩张就是总统的航空队。它现在包括在空军上校霍华德·克伦德勒指挥下的五架飞机。最早出现的是超级星座式科仑邦第三号，这是一架舒服的四个发动机的运输机，价值约二百万元，机内还有价值成千美元的其他的特殊设备。科仑邦号仅人事费用一项每年就要十万余美元。
    白宫的汽车队有四十多辆汽车和卡车。当总统坐飞机在国内走动时，至少有一辆汽车是尾随着他的。他还有一节私人的火车车厢。
    艾森豪威尔在他的十万美元一年的薪金之外还有五万美元供他私人开支。但是他的许多费用还是由政府支付。白宫的开支总数是二百四十万美元，其中四十万是用来雇用人员和保养园地的。除去白宫的行政官员和文书人员之外，这所官邸有七十二名雇员。家事雇员包括总管、管家、管事、厨司、随从、守门、男仆、洗衣头子、餐厅管理员和女仆等三十七人。平均工资是每人每年三千二百九十元。
    其他雇员包括总技师和助手、木匠、漆匠、电工、铝管工人、园丁、仓库管理员和文书等三十五人。平均工资是每人每年四千二百四十四元。除白宫之外，总统还有“戴维德营”，是在距华盛顿七十里地方一个山上的别墅。
    自从艾森豪威尔和他的夫人搬进白宫后，价值成千上万的免税礼物向他们涌来。仅葛底斯堡农场，在十八个月以前估计就收到价值四万美元的礼物，同时还有各种植物、动物和家具等不断地源源而来。
