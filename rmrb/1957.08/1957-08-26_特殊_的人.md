　　“Special” People
　　Lǐ Jìyě
　　In 1949, a trade in human blood was secretly underway in Taipei. A Taiwan University professor with a family of five was the object being auctioned off. Although he knew the news, he couldn't escape the clutches of the tiger, because at the time, three years' salary wasn't enough to buy five boat tickets to Hong Kong. He had no choice but to put the matter out of his mind and await his fate. One of his students came to say goodbye to him, because his own situation was very critical and he needed to escape as soon as possible. He told this student about his predicament, and the student, without hesitation, invited the professor to take the plane for which he had already bought a ticket. The professor was unwilling to abandon his family, so the student immediately said he would ask someone to buy the earliest boat tickets, and arrange for someone to take them on board at night. The professor's whole family escaped the tiger's clutches in this way. After this trade in human blood was disrupted by this underground Party member, it is said that the likes of Ye Qing clamored greatly, feeling very regretful that they couldn't punish that student who deserved to die because they didn't know his name. Now, I won't announce his name either, not because I'm afraid that right-wingers will spit blood at him or inform Taiwan, but because he is precisely the kind of person that right-wingers are cursing as being "made of special material." His "specialness" lies in the fact that he always puts others before himself, and doesn't like to fish for fame and reputation.
　　In the eyes of those right-wing ambitious individuals who want to overthrow the Communist Party day and night and "want to kill Communist Party members," this is naturally a serious "crime." The Communist Party has eradicated the inhuman massacres of revolutionaries that the Kuomintang carried out under its long-term reactionary rule in China, and has even brought some murderers to justice. In the hearts of those like Huang Shaohong, whose hands are covered in blood debts, this naturally arouses deep hatred, and they feel that the Communist Party is guilty of unforgivable crimes.
　　Speaking of blood debts, I can't help but think of many friends who were killed. One of them I knew since childhood, and I only swept his grave when I returned to my hometown this year, and learned more about the circumstances of his death. He had been in prison eight times, and had many life-and-death experiences. Once, he was released on bail one afternoon, and the next morning he was arrested again by Kuomintang secret agents. His health suffered serious damage. When my hometown was first liberated, he had not fully recovered, but he immediately took on the arduous task of anti-hegemony struggle. He unfortunately fell into the hands of bandits and local despots. They knew that he had a high reputation and influence among the people in that area, so they coerced and lured him to submit and surrender. He said that he would never waver in his faith and position even if he were smashed to pieces, and the blood debt owed to him would be repaid by the people. He shouted the slogan "Long live the Communist Party" and died calmly. Huang Shaohong and other anti-communist, anti-socialist right-wing elements certainly know clearly that there are countless such "special" people. Their blood created China's today. They have countless successors, and for a better tomorrow, they show some people unprecedented kindness by not pursuing their past wrongdoings. But if these stubborn right-wing elements attempt to undermine socialism and carry out conspiracies of restoration, the people know how to deal with them.

　　“特殊”的人
　　李霁野
    1949年，在台北秘密进行着一笔人血的买卖。一个家有五口人的台湾大学教授是被标售的对象。他虽然知道了消息，并无法逃出虎口，因为当时三年的薪水也不够买到香港的五张船票。他只好把这件事置之度外，静候宰割。他的一个学生来向他告别，因为他的情况十分危急，要尽快逃出去。他向这个学生谈了自己的处境，学生毫不迟疑的请这位教授坐他已经买好票的飞机。教授不肯抛开家人，那位学生马上就说去托人买最早的船票，并托人在夜里送他们上船。教授的全家就是这样脱离了虎口的。这笔人血的买卖被这个地下党员破坏了之后，听说叶青之流大大叫嚣过一番，对于那位罪该万死的学生因为不知其姓氏而未能加诛，还很觉遗憾哩。现在我也不来宣布他的名姓，并不是怕右派分子对他含血喷射或向台湾告密，而是因为他正是右派分子们所加以谩骂的“特殊材料制成的”人。他的“特殊”，就在于他一向是先人后己，也不喜欢沽名钓誉。
    这在那些日日夜夜要推翻共产党、“想杀共产党员”的右派野心家看来，自然是严重的“罪恶”。共产党使国民党在长期反动统治下所进行的惨绝人寰的对革命者的屠杀在中国绝迹，并且使有些杀人犯得到应有的惩罚，在血债累累的黄绍竑之流的心里自然会引起海深的仇恨，觉得共产党罪不容诛了。
    讲到血债，我不能不想起许多被杀害的朋友。其中有一个是我童年就认识的，今年回故乡时才为他扫了墓，并对他就义时的情况有较多的了解。他进过八次狱，有许多出生入死的经历。有一次他头一天下午被保释出来，第二天早晨又被国民党特务捕去。他的健康受到了严重的损害，在我的故乡初解放时，他还未完全恢复，但是他立刻就担任起艰巨的反霸斗争的工作。他不幸落到土匪兼恶霸地主的手里。他们知道他在那一带民众中有很高的威信和影响，就威逼利诱他屈服投降。他说，粉身碎骨他也不会动摇他的信仰和立场，欠他的血债人民是要讨还的。他高呼着“共产党万岁”的口号，从容的就义了。黄绍竑之流的反共反社会主义的右派分子当然清清楚楚的知道：这样“特殊”的人是无数的。他们的血创造了中国的今天。他们有无数的继承者，为了更好的明日，他们对一些人不追既往，表示天高地厚的恩德。但是假若这些顽固的右派分子妄想破坏社会主义，进行复辟的阴谋，人民是知道怎样对付他们的。
