    At the Jilin Provincial People's Congress
    A Group of Rightist Backbone Elements Confess Their Crimes

    (Our dispatch) At the recent Sixth Session of the First Jilin Provincial People's Congress, the reactionary features of a group of rightist backbone elements in the province were exposed. These rightist elements released poisonous arrows from the cultural, educational, industrial, commercial, and state organs, maliciously and wildly opposing the Communist Party. Yang Qing, the chairman of the Northeast Normal University branch of the China Democratic League and the director of the Department of Education of Northeast Normal University, Liu Zongxiang, the deputy convener of the Changchun Municipal Preparatory Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and lecturer at Northeast Normal University, Xu Xianyi, the leader of the Jiusan Society group at the Changchun Institute of Geology and Exploration and an associate professor, and Xu Naizuo, a professor at the Changchun Automobile and Tractor Institute, and other rightist elements, had planned to organize reactionary cliques and conspired to usurp the Party's leadership in the schools. The rightist element Yang Qing even colluded with the rightist element Liu Zongxiang of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the rightist element Ding Kequan of the Changchun Institute of Geology and Exploration, and others to take joint anti-Party actions. Wang Sunchu, the rightist element and Deputy Director of the Jilin Provincial Department of Transportation, fabricated facts, sowed discord, and attacked the Party's leadership. Zhang Zeduo, the vice chairman of the Changchun Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, peddled Zhang Naiqi's toxins everywhere and opposed the socialist transformation. Liang Zhizheng, a rightist element within the Party at the Jilin Daily, proposed the idea of a so-called "elected editorial board" to oppose the socialist direction of the newspaper.

    During the meeting, the representatives fully exposed the facts and used the method of reasoning struggle to refute the rightist elements completely. The rightist elements fell into a state of siege. Under everyone's righteous criticism and questioning, they were completely speechless and had to bow their heads, confess their crimes, and make self-criticisms to the Congress.

    在吉林省人民代表大会上
    一批右派骨干分子认罪
    本报讯　在最近举行的吉林省第一届人民代表大会第六次会议上，揭穿了省内一批右派骨干分子的反动面貌。这些右派分子从文教界、工商界和国家机关放出毒箭，恶毒地猖狂地反对共产党。民盟东北师范大学支部主任委员、东北师范大学教育系主任杨清，民革长春市筹委会副召集人、东北师范大学讲师刘宗向，九三学社长春地质勘探学院小组长、副教授徐贤仪和长春汽车拖拉机学院教授徐乃祚等右派分子，都有计划地组织了反动小集团，阴谋篡夺党在学校中的领导权。右派分子杨清甚至还同民革右派分子刘宗向、长春地质勘探学院右派分子丁克全等勾结起来，采取联合的反党行动。吉林省交通厅副厅长右派分子王孙楚捏造事实、挑拨离间，攻击党的领导。民建长春市副主任委员张泽多到处贩卖章乃器的毒素，反对社会主义改造。吉林日报党内右派分子梁致政提出所谓民选编委会的主张，反对报纸的社会主义方向。
    在会议过程中，代表们充分揭露事实，采用说理斗争的方式，把右派分子驳得体无完肤。右派分子陷入四面楚歌之中，在大家义正词严的批判和质问下，完全理屈词穷，不得不低头认罪，向大会作了检讨。
