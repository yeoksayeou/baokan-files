　　According to National Grain Ration Standards

　　My Family Not Only Has Enough Food, But Also a Surplus
    After the state implemented the unified purchase and sale of grain in rural areas in August 1955, the grain retention standard for each person per year in the northern rural areas of Anhui Province was 385 jin. At that time, I was not sure and suspected it would not be enough. Since then, I have recorded my family's grain income and expenditure situation year by year.

    In 1955, my family's total grain income was 8,347 jin. After deducting the state's purchase, seeds, and feed grain, my family of fifteen people consumed an average of 375 jin per person per year. Not only was it enough to eat, but there was also a surplus of more than 100 jin. In 1956, my family consumed an average of 371 jin per person per year, and at the end of the year, there was another surplus of more than 100 jin.

    The facts of my family's grain consumption over the past two years show that the state-stipulated grain ration is not only enough to eat, but also has a surplus. My family has fifteen people, and except for four children under the age of eight, the remaining eleven are relatively big eaters.

    My family has enough food, mainly due to the following experiences: careful calculation and strict budgeting. My family's grain consumption is entirely based on plans. We eat more grain during busy farming seasons, and less grain during winter leisure or rainy days when we cannot work, and change from three meals a day to two meals a day. There is a certain standard for taking grain every day, and leftovers are properly stored for the next meal; we do not use grain to feed chickens and ducks; we grind the grain more thoroughly when using the mill.

    The co-op allocated 1.7 mu of garden land for my family's own use. These lands are used to grow various vegetables, so we can eat green vegetables all year round. This not only saves grain, but also adjusts the taste.

### 按照国家规定的口粮标准　我家食粮不但够吃还有节余

　  按照国家规定的口粮标准
　　我家食粮不但够吃还有节余
    1955年8月，国家实行农村粮食统购统销办法后，我们安徽省北部农村每人每年留粮标准是三百八十五斤。当时我心里没底，怀疑不够吃。自那时起，我逐年记录了我家吃粮收支情况。
    1955年我家全年收入粮食八千三百四十七斤，除国家征购、种子、饲料留粮外全家十五口，每人一年平均吃了三百七十五斤，不但够吃，而且节余了一百多斤；1956年我家每人一年平均吃了三百七十一斤，到年底结算，又节余粮食一百多斤。
    这两年我家的用粮事实，说明了国家规定的口粮不但够吃，而且还能有节余。我家十五口人，除四个八岁以下小孩外，其余十一个人，都是比较能吃的。
    我家粮食够吃，主要有以下几点经验：精打细算。我家吃粮全部按照计划办事。在忙天就多吃点粮，冬闲或下雨不能干活日子就少吃点粮，并且由三顿饭改为两顿饭。每天取粮有一定的标准，有了剩饭保管好下顿再吃；不拿粮食喂鸡鸭；推磨时多推几遍。
    社里分配给我家自用的园地一亩七分，这些地用来种植各种蔬菜，因此一年四季都可掺青菜吃。这样不但节省粮食，还可调剂口味。
