Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 12th: The large-scale anti-Rightist struggle has been widely launched in the organizations of counties, schools, enterprises, and democratic parties throughout Shanxi Province.

The counties first used county newspapers, big-character posters, blackboard newspapers, and wired broadcasts to fully expose the reactionary words and deeds of these Rightists, and then mobilized the masses to conduct reasoned struggle with them based on facts. Some counties also organized "Analysis and Research Groups on Reactionary Arguments of Rightist Elements" to comprehensively analyze and study the remarks of Rightists, so as to make the struggle well-reasoned and forceful.

The broad masses of farmers actively participated in the anti-Rightist great debate in the county towns. They used their personal experiences to refute the reactionary statements of the Rightists. At the large-scale debate held in Anyi County on August 4, attended by more than 3,000 people, more than 500 representatives from 76 agricultural cooperatives participated, and more than 30 people spoke. In their speeches, they used their own accounts, the accounts of the entire cooperative, the accounts before and after land reform, the accounts of collectivization, the accounts of food, the accounts of clothing, etc., and made the seven or eight Rightist elements present unable to raise their heads. Some farmer representatives also accused the Rightist elements of poisoning their children.

After in-depth exposure and criticism, those who originally had vague understanding also improved their understanding, the ranks of activists continued to grow, and the exposure became more and more in-depth. After exposure and criticism, the Rightist elements have now been isolated, and some have bowed their heads in confession.

    山西广大农民参加反右派大辩论
    安邑县农民同右派算账算得右派抬不起头来
    新华社太原12日电　声势浩大的反右派斗争已经在山西省各县的机关、学校、企业和民主党派组织中广泛展开。
    各县对于这些右派分子的反动言行，首先利用县报、大字报、黑板报、有线广播等给以全面的揭露，然后发动群众用事实和他们展开说理斗争。有的县还组织了“分析研究右派分子反动论点小组”，对右派分子的言论进行全面的分析和研究，使斗争有理有力。
    广大农民积极参加了县城里的反右派大辩论。他们用亲身经历的事实批驳了右派分子的反动言论。在安邑县8月4日举行的三千多人的大辩论会上，有七十六个农业社的五百多名代表参加，有三十多人发言了。他们在发言中都用自己的账、全社的账、土地改革前后的账、合作化了的账、吃的账、穿的账等等，当场把七、八个右派分子算的头都不敢抬起来。有的农民代表还控诉右派分子毒害他们子弟的罪行。
    经过深入的揭露和批判，使原来认识模糊的人也提高了认识，积极分子的队伍不断在壮大，揭露也愈来愈深入。右派分子经过揭露和批判以后，现在已经被孤立起来，有的已低头认罪。
