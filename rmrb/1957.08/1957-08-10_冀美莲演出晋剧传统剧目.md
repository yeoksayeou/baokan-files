    Following the Puzhou Bangzi Opera Troupe, the First Performance Troupe of the Shanxi Provincial People's Jin Opera Troupe has also come to Beijing. Jin Opera is one of the three major opera genres in Shanxi Province, also known as Central Route Bangzi. The predecessor of this troupe was the Xinhua Opera Troupe. The main actor, Ji Meilian, enjoys a high reputation in Shanxi and won a second prize at the first National Opera Observation and Performance Conference. This time, they have brought traditional repertoire such as "Wen Yan," "Fan Wang Palace," and "Righteous and Heroic Wind," as well as modern dramas such as "A Volunteer's Fiancee." The play "Wen Yan" won seven awards, including those for director and music, at this year's Shanxi Provincial Second Opera Performance. (Yun)
