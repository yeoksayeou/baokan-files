Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 28th. At the fifth anti-Rightist symposium held by the Shanghai Branch of the Writers Association on the 26th, writers exposed the anti-Party and anti-socialist statements and actions of party member Wang Ruowang.

Wang Ruowang, editor-in-chief of "Wenyi Yuebao" (Literary Monthly), lost his position during the blooming and contending period, and attacked the Party as an "avant-garde." He not only attacked the Writers Association at the symposium held by the Municipal Party Committee, saying that the Writers Association had sectarianism, with "walls within walls and ditches outside the walls," and that "Mengya" (Sprouts) monthly was the "favored one of heaven," while "Wenyi Yuebao" was raised by a stepmother; but also said that the leadership's criticism of "Wenyi Yuebao" for not publishing the three batches of materials against Hu Feng and the review of his historical problems during the purge were all sectarianism.

During the blooming and contending period, Wang Ruowang wrote many anti-Party articles, including "Guarding Step by Step," "Separated by a Board," "Not Right," "Releasing Backward Elements," and "Digging Out the Old Roots of Sectarianism." In the article "Releasing Backward Elements," he opposed measuring progressiveness and backwardness by political standards, saying that the label of "backward element" truly left people with nowhere to turn and not knowing whether to laugh or cry, feeling as if they could never be rehabilitated; and said that the label of "backward element" was created by the personnel department. He believed that dividing the masses into three types—active, backward, and intermediate—was one of the roots of sectarianism. In his article "Separated by a Board," he said that the public representatives also had two sides.

When old workers in Shanghai held a symposium to refute the reactionary remarks of the Rightists, and when refuting Li Kangnian's proposal that the fixed interest rate of twenty years was a lack of confidence in reform, Wang Ruowang actually said that the workers were putting labels on Li Kangnian.

Wang Ruowang's anti-Party statements and actions had a very bad influence. Some capitalists, after reading Wang Ruowang's articles, said: The writer has already spoken for us, why shouldn't we stand up and speak?

### 作家王若望在替谁说话  作协上海分会揭发王的反党言行

    作家王若望在替谁说话
    作协上海分会揭发王的反党言行
    据新华社上海28日电　作家协会上海分会26日举行的第五次反右派座谈会上，作家们揭发了党员王若望的反党反社会主义言行。
    “文艺月报”主编王若望在鸣放中丧失立场，以“急先锋”的姿态向党进攻。他不但在市委召开的座谈会上攻击作协有宗派主义是“墙内有墙、墙外有沟”，说“萌芽”月刊是“天之娇子”，“文艺月报”是后娘养的；把领导上批评“文艺月报”未登反胡风的三批材料及肃反中审查他的历史问题，都说成是宗派主义。
    王若望在鸣放期间写了许多反党的文章。有“步步设防”、“一板之隔”、“不对头”、“释落后分子”、“挖掉宗派主义的老根”等。在“释落后分子”一文中，他反对以政治标准来衡量先进和落后，说“落后分子”这顶帽子真使人走头无路、哭笑不得，有永不得翻身之感；并说“落后分子”的帽子是人事部门制造出来的。他认为把群众分成积极、落后、中间三种人的做法是宗派主义的根源之一。他在“一板之隔”一文中说，公方代表也有两面性。
    当上海老工人举行座谈会驳斥右派反动言论，在反驳李康年提出定息二十年是缺乏改造的信心时，王若望竟说是工人给李康年扣帽子。
    王若望的反党言行，曾造成极坏的影响。一些资本家看了王若望的文章说：作家已替我们说话了，我们为什么不站出来讲。
