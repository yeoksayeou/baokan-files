Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 8th: The preparatory meeting for the Third World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament began today, dividing into four groups: peace activists, anti-militarists and religious figures, radiation scientists, and international law and disarmament experts. They will hold meetings to conduct specialized discussions on the prohibition of nuclear weapons and disarmament issues.

    Sri Lankan representative Perera delivered a major report at this morning's meeting of international law and disarmament experts. He pointed out that the use of nuclear weapons by certain countries to kill large numbers of people violates the spirit of international law. He believes that these countries disregard the spirit of international law because the United Nations does not allow certain truly sovereign countries to participate, rendering itself a powerless organization. He said that the task ahead is to strive to have international law explicitly prohibit nuclear weapons. He proposed that the group meeting submit two proposals to the conference: one, demanding that the United Nations immediately realize the prohibition of nuclear weapons and the reduction of armaments; and two, requiring the representatives of participating countries to demand that their governments prohibit nuclear weapons.

    Subsequently, Japanese representatives Yoshitaro Hirano and Makoto Hori made reports on the illegality of nuclear weapons testing and the issues of military agreements and military bases, respectively. In their reports, they both expressed full support for Perera's report. In his report, Hori Makoto pointed out that the nature of the "collective self-defense" advocated by the United States is actually an aggressive military alliance; it is completely different from the nature of a treaty guaranteeing collective security. He said that the United States' "collective defense" agreements involve establishing military bases in foreign countries, infringing on the independence of the contracting countries, sending military advisory groups to interfere in their internal affairs, and intensifying economic control over these countries. He also pointed out that the United States' "collective defense" agreements are the root cause of international tension. When discussing how to guarantee world peace and security, he said that the most important issue at present is the abolition of military agreements and the withdrawal of foreign troops. He also supported the proposal made by the Soviet and Chinese governments to establish a collective security guarantee treaty.

    At the meeting of radiation scientists, Chinese representative and physicist Zhu Hongyuan, British representative and Vice-Chairman of the British Atomic Scientists Association Rotblat, Japanese representative and Rikkyo University professor Iwao Ogawa, and Peruvian representative Dr. Utega spoke. They unanimously pointed out the harm of nuclear weapons to human life. Scientists from various countries also discussed the problem of nuclear weapons testing polluting the air and the earth.

    第三届禁止氢弹大会进行分组讨论
    众口一词主张禁止核武器实行裁军
    日本代表支持中苏提出建立集体安全条约的建议
    新华社东京8日电　第三届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会预备会从今天开始分成和平活动家、非战主义者与宗教家、放射能科学家和国际法与裁军问题专家四个小组举行会议，就禁止核武器和裁军问题进行专门性的讨论。
    锡兰代表佩雷拉在今天上午的国际法与裁军问题专家会议上做了主要报告。他指出，某些国家使用核武器大量杀人，是违反国际法的精神的。他认为，这些国家忽视国际法的精神是因为联合国没有让某些真正有主权的国家参加，使自己变成没有力量的组织。他说，今后的任务是努力使国际法明文规定禁止核武器。他提议由小组会议向大会提出要求联合国立即实现禁止核武器和裁减军备以及参加会议的各国代表要求自己的政府禁止核武器两个提案。
    接着，日本代表平野义太郎和堀真琴分别就试验核武器的违法问题和军事协定与军事基地问题做了报告。他们在报告中都表示完全支持佩雷拉的报告。堀真琴在报告中指出，美国主张的“集体自卫”的性质实际上就是侵略性的军事同盟；它同保障集体安全条约的性质完全不同。他说，美国的“集体防御”协定就是在外国设立军事基地，侵害缔约国的独立，派遣军事顾问团干涉它们的内政，并且在经济上加紧控制这些国家。他还指出，美国的“集体防御”协定是制造国际紧张局势的根源。谈到如何保障世界和平和安全的时候，他说，目前最重要的问题就是废除军事协定和撤退外国军队。他并且支持苏联和中国政府曾经提出的建立集体安全保障条约的建议。
    在放射能科学家会议上，中国代表、物理学家朱洪元，英国代表、英国原子能科学家协会副主席罗特布拉特，日本代表、立教大学教授小川岩雄和秘鲁代表乌特加博士等人发了言。他们一致指出核武器对人类生命的危害。各国科学家们并且讨论了核武器试验对空气、大地的污染问题。
