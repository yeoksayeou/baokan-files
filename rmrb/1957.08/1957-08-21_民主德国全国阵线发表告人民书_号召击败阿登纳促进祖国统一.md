Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 20th, via TASS: The National Committee of the National Front of Democratic Germany opened its meeting on August 19th in Berlin. The meeting discussed two issues: "The Path to National Rebirth of Germany" and "The Tasks of the National Front in Preparing to Celebrate the Fortieth Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution."

National Committee member of the National Front and member of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, Ferner, delivered a report on the first item on the agenda. He pointed out that the struggle for peace and the reunification of Germany has now entered a new stage. The declaration of the government of the German Democratic Republic on the path to peace and the reunification of Germany fully conforms to the goals of the National Front and is its fighting program. This statement is also a program of action for the German working class and all peace-loving, democratic, and patriotic Germans.

Ferner also talked about the upcoming West German parliamentary elections. He said that the significance of this election lies in the possibility of creating conditions for the implementation of new policies of peace, disarmament, mutual understanding, and social security. The balance of political forces in West Germany must be changed according to the vital interests of the working class and all working people.

Subsequently, the conference discussed Ferner's report and adopted the National Committee's appeal to the people on the issue of the West German parliamentary elections.

The appeal calls on all voters in West Germany to defeat Adenauer's Christian Democratic Union in the elections, thereby paving the way for stopping the policies of preparing for atomic war and deepening the division of Germany.

The appeal points out that the proposal put forward by the German Democratic Republic to establish a federation of the two Germanys is the only possible path to restoring German unity, and suggests that East and West Germany jointly discuss and reach understanding on the following issues:

(1) Prohibit the storage and production of atomic weapons on German territory, and prohibit the propaganda of atomic war.

(2) The two Germanys should withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact respectively, abolish West Germany's conscription system, and both sides should sign an agreement on the number of troops.

(3) Jointly or separately demand that the four major powers rapidly withdraw their troops from the entire German territory. The appeal calls for strengthening and expanding contacts between citizens of the two Germanys to jointly discuss the major vital issues of the German people.

The conference also heard and adopted a report by National Committee member of the National Front and General Secretary of the Free Democratic Party of Germany, Gerlach, on the second item on the agenda.

    费尔纳还谈到即将到来的西德议会选举。他说，这次选举的意义在于：将有可能为实行和平、裁军、相互了解和社会安全的新政策创造条件。必须根据工人阶级和全体劳动人民的切身利益来改变西德的政治力量对比。
    接着，大会讨论了费尔纳的报告，并且通过了全国委员会就西德议会选举问题的告人民书。
    告人民书号召西德所有选民在选举中击败阿登纳的基督教民主联盟从而为制止准备原子战争和加深德国分裂的政策铺平道路。
    告人民书指出德意志民主共和国所提出建立两个德国的联邦的建议是恢复德国统一的唯一可能的道路，并且建议东西德就下列问题共同讨论和达成谅解：
    （一）禁止在德国领土上贮存和生产原子武器，禁止宣传原子战争。
    （二）两个德国分别退出北大西洋公约组织和华沙条约，废除西德的兵役制和双方就军队人数签订协定。
    （三）联合地或分别地要求四大国从整个德国领土上迅速撤出它们的军队。告人民书号召加强和扩大两个德国公民之间的接触，共同讨论德国人民的重大的切身问题。
