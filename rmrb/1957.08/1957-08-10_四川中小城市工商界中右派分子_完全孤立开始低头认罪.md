Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, August 8th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Song He reports: Recently, a group of rightist elements opposing the Communist Party and socialism has been exposed among the industrial and commercial circles in small and medium-sized cities in Sichuan Province.

The materials recently revealed in Wanxian, Zigong, Yibin, Leshan, Nanchong, Suining, and other places show that when the rectification movement had just begun, this group of rightist elements in industrial and commercial circles, under the pretext of "helping the rectification," widely disseminated the reactionary remarks of rightist ringleaders in industrial and commercial circles in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Chengdu, and other places, and shouted from every corner, "Fixed interest is not exploitation," "The Five-Anti Campaign was malicious slander," and "Abolish public representatives." Chen Yumin, director of the Wanxian City Federation of Industry and Commerce and a rightist element, used his position to instigate students at the Wanxian Special District Industrial and Commercial Circles Training Class to oppose the Communist Party, organizing them to return to their respective counties to set "fires." This rightist element, blinded by greed, even demanded that "tung oil production areas be assigned to private merchants for operation" (he is a large oil merchant). Luo Xiaoyuan, chairman of the Zigong City Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, recently exposed by the people of Zigong City, is a rightist element with serious ideas of changing the political climate. Together with Yan Xinshu, another rightist element in the local industrial and commercial circles, he spread rumors everywhere, encouraging the industrial and commercial circles to resist socialist transformation.

After more than half a month of struggle, this group of rightist elements has been completely isolated and has had to begin to lower their heads and confess their guilt to the people.

    四川中小城市工商界中右派分子
    完全孤立开始低头认罪
    据新华社成都8日电　新华社记者宋禾报道：在四川省中小城市的工商界中，最近揭发出了一批反对共产党和反对社会主义的右派分子。
    万县、自贡、宜宾、乐山、南充、遂宁等地最近揭发的材料表明：这批工商界中的右派分子在整风运动刚刚开始的时候，就以“帮助整风”为借口，大肆散布北京、天津、上海、成都等地工商界右派头目的反动言论，从各个角落发出了“定息不是剥削”、“五反是挟嫌诬赖”、“撤销公方代表”等叫嚣。万县市工商联主任、右派分子陈裕民利用职权，到万县专区工商界讲习班煽动学员反对共产党，组织他们回各县去放“火”。这个利令智昏的右派分子，竟要求“把桐油产区划归私商经营”（他是个大油商）。最近被自贡市人民揭露出来的民主建国会自贡市委主任委员罗筱元，是一个有严重变天思想的右派分子。他和当地工商界另一右派分子颜心畬一道，四处造谣，鼓动工商界抗拒社会主义改造。
    经过半个多月的斗争，这批右派分子已经完全陷于孤立，不得不开始向人民低头认罪。
