Xinhua News Agency, July 31st: Tonight, 20,000 people in Beijing held a grand meeting in Zhongshan Park to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

Colored lights, like strings of dazzling pearls, adorned the ancient park with extraordinary beauty. When national leaders such as Vice Chairman Zhu De, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Premier Zhou Enlai, marshals, and generals entered the green and shady venue, waves of applause erupted from the crowd.

Also attending tonight's meeting were other national leaders, including Peng Dehuai, Deng Xiaoping, He Long, Chen Yi, Nie Rongzhen, Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Peng Zhen, Chen Shutong, Dong Biwu, and alternate members of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau, Zhang Wentian, Lu Dingyi, and Kang Sheng.

Mayor of Beijing, Peng Zhen, delivered a speech first, paying high tribute to all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, to the fallen martyrs, to the demobilized soldiers who participated in the revolutionary armed struggle, the revolutionary disabled soldiers, and the families of martyrs and revolutionary soldiers, and paying high tribute to the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong for leading the Chinese people's armed forces to achieve revolutionary victory. He celebrated the great revolutionary victories and great construction achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party.

In his speech, Vice Chairman Zhu De, first on behalf of the CPC Central Committee, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and Chairman Mao, extended warm congratulations to the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, demobilized soldiers, militiamen, and young people preparing to enlist. He said that the Chinese People's Liberation Army is an armed force whose sole purpose is to thoroughly liberate the people and resolutely protect the achievements of the people's revolution. Now it has become a modern people's army, undertaking the glorious task of defending socialist construction, safeguarding national security, and actively preparing to liberate Taiwan, and together with the fraternal armies of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, undertaking the great task of defending world peace. He firmly believed that the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which has been good at implementing the Party's political and military lines for thirty years, good at inheriting and carrying forward its fine traditions and style, and good at studying Marxist-Leninist military science, will certainly strive to complete the new historical tasks entrusted to it by the Party and the people.

Next, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of National Defense Peng Dehuai spoke at the meeting. After outlining the great victories in revolutionary war and army building achieved under the correct leadership of the Party over the past thirty years, he said that in the future, in the more arduous and difficult tasks of defending socialist construction, our army must continue to strengthen the Party's leadership over the army. Any attempt to weaken the Party's leadership over the army is an attempt to change the nature of our army, to undermine the most powerful pillar of our socialist system, and to allow capitalism to be restored in China. This is absolutely not permissible. He went on to say that in order to effectively defend the motherland, it is necessary to continue to work hard to strengthen national defense construction under possible conditions, to build our army into an excellent and modern revolutionary army, and to build our country into a country with strong defense facilities. He also mentioned that we should continue to carry forward the spirit of hard struggle and overcoming difficulties of our army, always maintain the nature of a laboring people's army, and always maintain the fine tradition of diligence and thrift. At the end of his speech, Marshal Peng Dehuai paid high tribute to the national militia, workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and other patriotic people who vigorously supported the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

Subsequently, people from all walks of life in Beijing, as well as the central and Beijing organizations of various democratic parties and people's organizations, presented silk banners to the Chinese People's Liberation Army at the meeting. The silk banner presented by the people from all walks of life in Beijing read: "Thirty years of hard struggle, thirty years of glorious victory, carry forward revolutionary traditions, defend socialism!"

Finally, the garden party began. More than a dozen professional art troupes gave wonderful performances in ten places, and songs and laughter resounded through the night sky. (Attached picture)

    首都举行庆祝“八一”建军节大会
    朱德副主席、彭德怀副总理、彭真市长致词祝贺
    新华社31日讯　北京市二万人民，今天晚上在中山公园举行大会欢庆中国人民解放军建军三十周年。
    彩色的灯光像是一串串眩眼的珍珠，把这个古老的公园打扮得分外美丽。当朱德副主席、刘少奇委员长、周恩来总理等国家领导人和元帅们、将军们进入绿荫掩映的会场时，人群中不断响起了潮水般的掌声。
    参加今晚大会的，还有国家的其他领导人员彭德怀、邓小平、贺龙、陈毅、聂荣臻、李济深、沈钧儒、郭沫若、黄炎培、彭真、陈叔通、董必武等，以及中共中央政治局候补委员张闻天、陆定一、康生。
    北京市长彭真首先致词，他分别向中国人民解放军全体指战员、向死难烈士、向参加过革命武装斗争的复员军人、革命残废军人以及烈士家属、革命军人家属致崇高的敬意，并向领导中国人民武装取得了革命胜利的中国共产党和毛泽东同志致崇高的敬意。庆祝我国人民在共产党领导下取得的伟大革命胜利和伟大的建设成就。
    朱德副主席在讲话中首先代表中共中央、中华人民共和国政府和毛主席，向中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军、复员军人、民兵和准备入伍服兵役的青年们，致热烈的祝贺。他说，中国人民解放军是一支以彻底解放人民和坚决保护人民革命成果作为自己的唯一宗旨的武装力量，现在它已经成为一支现代化的人民军队，正在担负着保卫社会主义建设、保卫国家安全和积极准备解放台湾的光荣任务，并且同苏联和各人民民主国家的兄弟军队共同担负着保卫世界和平的伟大任务。他深信三十年来善于执行党的政治路线和军事路线、善于继承和发扬自己的优良传统和作风，善于学习马克思列宁主义军事科学的中国人民解放军，一定能够努力完成党和人民付托给的新的历史任务。
    接着，国务院副总理兼国防部长彭德怀在大会上讲话。他概述了三十年来依靠党的正确领导取得革命战争和军队建设的伟大胜利以后说，今后我军在保卫社会主义建设的更为繁重和艰巨的任务中，必须继续加强党对军队的领导。企图削弱党对军队的领导，就是企图改变我军的性质，就是企图破坏我国社会主义制度的最有力的支柱，就是企图使资本主义在中国复辟，这是绝对不能容许的。他接着说，为了有效地保卫祖国，必须在可能条件下继续努力加强国防建设，把我军建设成为一支优良的现代化的革命军队，把我国建设成为一个有坚强防御设施的国家。他还说到应当继续发扬我军艰苦奋斗、克服困难的精神，永远保持劳动人民军队的本质，永远保持克勤克俭的优良作风。在讲话的最后，彭德怀元帅分别对大力支援中国人民解放军的全国民兵、工人、农民、革命知识分子和其他爱国人士致以崇高的敬意。
    随后，北京市各界人民以及各民主党派、各人民团体的中央和北京市组织在会上向中国人民解放军献了锦旗。北京市各界人民献的锦旗上写着：“艰苦奋斗的三十年，光辉胜利的三十年，发扬革命传统，保卫社会主义！”
    最后，游园开始了。十多个专业文艺团体分别在十处作精采表演，歌声和欢笑响彻夜空。（附图片）
