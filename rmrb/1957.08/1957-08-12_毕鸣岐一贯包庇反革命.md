Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 11th. The Tianjin Municipal Democratic National Construction Association and the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce held a joint expanded meeting of standing committee members on the 10th. Shi Junying, Li Mianzhi, Che Chongyuan, Pang Xinwu, and others exposed the crimes of Bi Mingqi, a rightist element in industrial and commercial circles, for consistently sheltering counter-revolutionary elements.

According to their revelations, Bi Mingqi arranged for his nephew, the counter-revolutionary element Bi Jingsheng, to be the director of the Xinmin Chemical Factory, which he himself opened, and Bi Jingsheng has not made a confession about his past for eight years. Bi Jingsheng was originally a company commander in the Chiang Kai-shek army and a Kuomintang member who had massacred people, raped women, and had blood debts on his hands. This counter-revolutionary element fled to Tianjin after the liberation of Northeast China and had been sheltered by Bi Mingqi until he was arrested in June of this year. Another counter-revolutionary element, Shi Leisheng, was originally a Kuomintang county magistrate who had consistently oppressed the people and had numerous blood debts. He came to Tianjin in 1950 and was placed by Bi Mingqi as a private secretary in his own Hua Shen Trading Company. The counter-revolutionary element Bo Zhanyi was originally a major military law officer and warden of the detention center of the Kuomintang Shandong Provincial Security Command, and a lieutenant colonel military law officer of the Pacification Headquarters. He committed heinous crimes. After liberation, Bi Mingqi hid him in the Chamber of Commerce under his leadership as the chief secretary. In addition, Bi Mingqi also shielded the counter-revolutionary elements Hu Shenzhi, Ji Decheng, Cao Zizeng, and others.
