Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 12th: The Third World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament began its five-day formal plenary session today at the Tokyo Gymnasium.

Attending today's conference were ninety-six foreign delegates from twenty-two countries and five thousand Japanese delegates. In addition, more than a thousand observers attended the conference.

Ikuo Yasui, Chairman of the Conference Agenda Committee, delivered the opening remarks, saying that thanks to the support of world public opinion, this World Conference is larger in scale than before. He pointed out that the current situation is that while the atomic strategy system is being rapidly strengthened, the movement against the atomic strategy system is developing and strengthening day by day. The future destiny of mankind depends on who wins out between these two trends. Therefore, the task of this conference is to discuss how to crush the atomic strategy system and to promote the realization of a ban on the testing, manufacturing, and use of nuclear weapons, to achieve disarmament, and to utilize atomic energy for peaceful purposes.

Representatives of various Japanese political parties then addressed the meeting. Shigezaburo Suzuki, Chairman of the Socialist Party, said in his speech that the entire Socialist Party supports the movement to ban nuclear weapons and will fight to the end to promote this movement.

Sanzo Nosaka, First Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party, strongly condemned in his speech the Japanese government's assistance to the United States in expanding military bases for the use of nuclear weapons, attempting to allow the United States to transport nuclear weapons into Japan to assist the United States in promoting the atomic strategy system. He called on the people of all countries to unite and wage a resolute struggle to thwart the conspiracy to forcibly test nuclear weapons and advance the atomic strategy system.

Representatives of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party of Japan and the Japanese Prime Minister also made brief speeches at the meeting.

Next, representatives from various countries spoke.

American delegate Jekker said that the three American delegates attending the World Conference felt very ashamed of the United States dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He said that the danger that nuclear explosion tests bring to mankind makes people urgently demand a halt to such tests. No country has the right to pollute another country's atmosphere without the consent of that country; no generation has the right to harm the next generation without the consent of the next generation.

Soviet delegate Kirov pointed out in his speech that atomic war threatens the Eastern countries; at the same time, in recent months, European countries have taken measures to equip themselves with nuclear weapons, and the headquarters of the North Atlantic Group has decided to arm the armies of all countries participating in the North Atlantic Treaty, including West Germany, with nuclear weapons. In Europe, the threat of atomic war has also greatly increased. Kirov demanded that actions to transport nuclear weapons into other countries be stopped, and that the nuclear weapons production race be stopped to prevent atomic war. He said that the Soviet government has repeatedly stated that it wants to ban nuclear weapons; the Soviet Union is willing to stop the production and storage of nuclear weapons. If the other two major powers are also willing to undertake the same obligations, the Soviet Union is also willing to completely or temporarily stop testing atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs. At the same time, the Soviet Union is also prepared to conclude agreements on these issues. He finally called for practical actions to ban nuclear weapons and proposed to abolish the Warsaw, North Atlantic, Southeast Asia, and other military treaties to achieve world peace.

Indian delegate Rameshwari Nehru said at the meeting that the Japanese people's heartfelt call for a ban on nuclear weapons has been supported by the whole world. Some people, in order to stop the opposition of public opinion, even tell the lie of the "clean bomb." She believes that there will never be a "clean bomb" in the world. Mrs. Nehru finally stated that the conference will definitely come to a conclusion that guides action.

At the morning session today, congratulatory telegrams from Soviet Premier Bulganin, Yugoslav President Tito, Indian Vice President Radhakrishnan, and some Chinese people's organizations were read out.

At the afternoon session today, Cai Tingkai, head of the Chinese delegation, spoke. He first expressed his respect on behalf of the Chinese people to the Japanese people who are fighting for peace, and expressed his deep sympathy and condolences to the Japanese atomic bomb victims. He said that the Chinese people are working hard on peaceful construction. From our personal experience, we particularly feel the preciousness of peace. We regard safeguarding world peace as our glorious and sacred task. We firmly demand a ban on atomic weapons and advocate an immediate halt to the testing of these weapons, so that atomic energy can serve the happiness of mankind. He pointed out that the common and urgent demand of the people all over the world is that the countries concerned reach an agreement on the prohibition of atomic weapons and universal disarmament as soon as possible; in this regard, it is especially important to immediately and unconditionally stop the testing of atomic nuclear weapons, and it is not allowed to deliberately confuse right and wrong and delay and evade on these issues under any pretext.

Egyptian delegate El-Din assured the conference in the name of the people of Egypt and the Arab countries that they fully support the work of the conference. He pointed out that the purpose of the conference is to eliminate the crisis caused by the testing of nuclear weapons; the conference must not only pass declarations and resolutions, but also implement them.

Representatives from the United States, Britain, Ceylon, West Germany, the Women's International Democratic Federation, and the World Peace Council also spoke at the meeting.

After the representatives of various countries spoke, representatives of the four subcommittees of peace activists, pacifists and religious figures, radioactivity scientists, and experts on international law and disarmament issues reported to the conference on the opinions they put forward at the international preparatory meetings in the previous days.

Kubo Yama, wife of Aikichi Kuboyama, a victim of the U.S. hydrogen bomb test on Bikini Island, also denounced the crime of testing nuclear weapons at the conference.

    禁止氢弹世界大会举行正式全体大会
    发言者同声要求停止核试验禁止核武器
    据新华社东京12日电　第三届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会从今天开始在东京体育馆举行为时五天的正式全体大会。
    出席今天大会的有二十二个国家的九十六位外国代表和五千位日本代表。另外，还有一千多位旁听者出席了大会。
    大会议程委员会主席安井郁致开会词说，由于世界舆论的支持，这次世界大会的规模比以前更大了。他指出，目前的形势是，在原子战略体制迅速加强的同时，反对原子战略体制的运动正在日益发展与强大起来。人类未来的命运要看这两股潮流的谁胜谁负而定。因此，这次大会的任务是：就如何粉碎原子战略体制问题进行讨论，并且促使实现禁止核武器的试验、制造和使用，实现裁军，把原子能利用于和平事业上。
    日本各政党的代表接着在会上致词。社会党委员长铃木茂三郎在讲话中，表示社会党全党支持禁止核武器的运动，并且要为推动这一运动奋斗到底。
    日本共产党第一书记野坂参三在讲话中强烈地谴责了日本政府帮助美国扩大使用核武器的军事基地，企图让美国把核武器运进日本，来协助美国推行原子战略体制。他要求世界各国人民团结起来进行坚决的斗争，使强行试验核武器和推进原子战略体制的阴谋遭到失败。
    日本执政党自由民主党和日本首相的代表也在会上简单地致了词。
    接着，各国代表讲话。
    美国代表捷柯说，出席世界大会的三位美国代表对于美国在广岛和长崎投下原子弹一事感到非常羞耻。他说，核爆炸试验为人类带来的危险促使人们迫切要求停止这种试验。任何国家都没有权利在别国没有同意的情况下就污染别国的大气；任何一代人也没有权利在下一代人没有同意的情况下损害下一代人。
    苏联代表凯罗夫在讲话中指出，原子战争威胁着东方各国；同时，最近几个月以来，欧洲各国已经采取了装备核武器的措施，北大西洋集团的司令部已经决定以核武器武装包括西德在内的参加北大西洋条约的各国军队。在欧洲，原子战争的威胁也大大地增加了。凯罗夫要求制止把核武器运进别国境内的行动，停止核武器的生产竞赛，来阻止原子战争。他说，苏联政府曾经再三声明要禁止核武器；苏联愿意停止核武器的生产和贮藏。如果另外的两个大国也愿意承担同样的义务，苏联也愿意完全或者暂时停止试验原子弹、氢弹。同时，苏联也准备缔结有关这些问题的协定。他最后要求用实际行动来禁止核武器，并且提议取消华沙、北大西洋、东南亚等军事条约，实现世界和平。
    印度代表拉米希瓦里·尼赫鲁夫人在会上说，日本人民从心里发出的禁止核武器的呼吁已经得到全世界的支持。有些人为了制止舆论的反对，竟说什么“干净炸弹”的谎话。她认为，世界上绝不会有“干净的炸弹”。尼赫鲁夫人最后表示大会一定会得出一个指导行动的结论。
    在今天上午的会议上宣读了苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁、南斯拉夫总统铁托、印度副总统拉德克里希南等国家的领袖和中国一些人民团体的贺电。
    在今天下午的大会上，中国代表团团长蔡廷锴讲了话。他首先代表中国人民向为和平而奋斗的日本人民表示敬意，并且对日本原子弹受害者表示深切同情和慰问。他说，中国人民正在努力从事于和平建设，从我们切身的体验中，特别感到和平的可贵，我们把保卫世界和平看作是自己的光荣而神圣的任务。我们坚决要求禁止原子武器，主张立即停止这些武器的试验，让原子能为人类的幸福服务。他指出，全世界人民共同的迫切要求是：有关国家尽速就禁止原子武器和普遍裁军问题达成协议；在这方面尤其重要的是应该立即无条件停止原子核武器的试验，并且不允许在这些问题上以任何借口故意混淆是非，拖延躲闪。
    埃及代表艾勒登以埃及和阿拉伯各国人民的名义，向大会保证他们全面支持大会的工作。他指出，大会的目的是消除由于核武器的试验而引起的危机；大会不仅要通过宣言和决议，而且要予以执行。
    美国、英国、锡兰、西德、国际民主妇女联合会和世界和平理事会的代表也都在会上讲了话。
    在各国代表发言后，和平活动家、非战主义者与宗教家、放射能科学家、国际法与裁军问题专家等四个小组委员会的代表，向大会报告了它们在前几天的国际预备会议上提出的意见。
    美国在比基尼岛试验氢弹的被害者久保山爱吉的妻子久保山铃还在大会上控诉了试验核子武器的罪行。
