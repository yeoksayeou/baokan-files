    Denouncing the comprador politician Xiao Qian
    Cao Yu
    Xiao Qian is a familiar figure in cultural circles. He is intelligent, capable of writing, and proficient in both Chinese and English. However, he has a flaw: he is slick, deep, and hard to figure out. In the past, he used to wriggle around in muddy waters, thinking himself a dragon-like figure. But in today's clear water, everyone can see clearly that he is obviously a loach.
    During May and June of this year, when "dark clouds were churning in the Chinese sky," he suddenly poked his head out, stirring up trouble, trying to win over some people and attacking others. He tried to win over individual ambitious people who were anti-Party, anti-socialist, and plotting to usurp the Party's leadership. He attacked those who were loyal and defended the Party's cause. He also wrote articles slandering the Party, Party member writers, and the new society. He focused his firepower on the People's Literature Publishing House, "Translation" [Yiwen], and "Literary Gazette" [Wenyi Bao], launching a series of anti-Party activities during this period.
    We all know his past. We have not forgotten the anti-communist and anti-Soviet articles he wrote in "Ta Kung Pao" and "Xinlu". He is a rightist element with a history and a conspiracy. Today, everyone has completely seen through him.
    People say he is a loach, which can also be seen in his articles. When we criticize Xiao Qian, we point out his shortcomings, faults, and mistakes, frankly criticizing him in the hope that he can become a good person again, an upright person, someone who doesn't engage in crooked calculations. But when he writes articles, he becomes circuitous and winding, first saying many nice things and then scolding you. He is like someone who can scold you with a smile. If you say he is smiling, he is actually scolding you fiercely; if you say he is scolding you, he says, "I am clearly smiling at you with good intentions."
    We don't like this method of scolding with a smile. But in his articles, he adopts this tactic towards the Party and today's society.
    Take his article "Reassurance, Tolerance, and Personnel Work," published in the People's Daily on June 1st, as an example.
    Throughout the article, he is clearly opposed to Marxism-Leninism, attempting to replace the ideological leadership of Marxism with the so-called "democratic spirit" of the bourgeoisie. But he insists on raising both hands, enthusiastically supporting it, and saying that Marxism itself has an irresistible attraction, and everyone will consciously accept the truth. Clearly, he distorts the facts, slandering that today's Chinese people do not have the freedom to speak and write. But before that sentence, he mockingly sneers with malice: "Since liberation, every Chinese person can proudly say that our government has never issued an order to ban a book." Clearly, he puts on a smiling face, hoping that everyone will use the bourgeois standpoint and viewpoint to "think independently" and "choose freely." Yet he disguises himself as a loyal follower of Marxism, scolding the Party's leadership as "dogmatists who use Marxism-Leninism as a stick," "mystifying and vulgarizing Marxism-Leninism," and "forcing people to become disgusted with politics."
    How does he slander the Party's leadership today?
    He says that the dogmatic leadership is like the wheel in front of a mantis. And the mantis refers to the literary and art workers who, according to him, cannot "think independently." The wheels of the dogmatists are so ruthless that many people are crushed beneath them. Then he goes on to say that the key to the problem is that the leadership does not have enough "reassurance" in literary and art workers. To "reassure" literary and art workers, let them "freely" let go, only then can we achieve the "letting go" of "a hundred flowers bloom."
    This is clearly hostility and distortion towards the Party's leadership in literary and art work. The Party has never been uneasy about patriotic revolutionary literary and art workers who support socialism. Many non-Party literary and art workers lead important literary and art institutions and publications. Under the leadership of the Party, they have done a lot of work and achieved remarkable results. They have never said that the Party is uneasy about them. But Xiao Qian suddenly appears as a righteous man. Sometimes he says the Party is "killing the chicken to scare the monkey," sometimes he says the Party does not allow people to think independently, and sometimes he says the Party's leadership is uneasy about people. He deliberately sows discord, his intention is to make literary and art workers not believe in the Party, stay far away from the Party, and make everyone believe, like him, that the Party's leadership in literary and art circles is "dogmatic rule." He is so irreconcilable with the Party, but he insists on putting on the face of a gentleman speaking righteously. The people in the "Land of Two-Faced People" in "Flowers in the Mirror" all have two faces, smiling in front and spewing poisonous gas behind. Xiao Qian is this kind of two-faced "hero."
    However, even in such vicious attacks, he cunningly sets up many escape routes. In that article, while scolding that today's society "vulgarizes politics," he also uses two-faced tactics, burying a point: "In our society, there is a strong and healthy political atmosphere." Clearly, he agrees with the hypocritical "tolerance" of capitalism, but he insists on ingratiating himself with everyone and saying: "The governments of capitalist countries are uneasy about their cultural figures." Saying: "The two countries of Britain and the United States, which pride themselves on being 'democratic,' have long gone bankrupt in the face of this test of 'tolerance'." Now we have to ask Xiao Qian, do you think Britain and the United States are "democratic" or "undemocratic"? Let us say it for you, no matter how you pretend to be crazy and foolish in front of us, setting up defenses step by step, scolding Britain and the United States for being "undemocratic," you yearn for this "democracy" in your heart. Your past articles prove that you were like this, and your current articles prove that you are still like this.
    Talking about "tolerance," he says that he wants us to adopt his so-called "democratic spirit." He says, "You should tolerate people you don't like, you should tolerate things you don't like," this is called "democratic spirit." He quotes a very beautiful sentence, which is: "I completely disagree with your opinion, but I am willing to sacrifice my life to defend your right to express this opinion." In fact, this sentence is a trick, a magic of language, because this sentence has no real basis. Everyone can see that this is a lie told by the bourgeoisie to deceive people. During the period of Kuomintang rule, the period when the Kuomintang claimed to be "the most democratic and freest," the cruel oppression and massacre suffered by our revolutionaries has completely proven that the sentence quoted by Xiao Qian is a heartless lie. However, at that time we did not see Xiao Qian quoting this "famous saying." At that time, he did not say to the Communist Party: "I completely disagree with your opinion, but I—Xiao Qian, am willing to sacrifice my life to defend your right to express this opinion." But today, he proudly quotes this "famous saying" and says to us: "This is a very heroic sentence." I think this sentence is not heroic at all. In the mouths of those British gentlemen, it is a deceptive pretty sentence, but today, when it comes out of Xiao Qian's mouth, it is a sentence with ulterior motives and is very sinister. Sure enough, he further slanders that every Chinese person does not have the freedom to speak and write; sure enough, he alludes to the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, distorting and saying: "In the name of maintaining the constitution, doing things that are essentially contrary to the constitution."
    Frankly speaking, we are the most tolerant. As long as he supports the Party and supports socialism, no matter how many mistakes and shortcomings he has, we will always tolerate and educate him, hoping that he will correct them. However, we also have people who we absolutely cannot tolerate, and things that we absolutely cannot tolerate, and that is Zhang Luo and other rightist elements, and their anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks spread everywhere. Xiao Qian wants us to show his so-called "democratic spirit" to the enemy, let them "freely" shake the foundation of socialism and the foundation of the Communist Party; Xiao Qian wants us to "tolerate" people like Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, and Chu Anping, then we will say to Xiao Qian: "You are not allowed to talk nonsense and move around!"
    Does Xiao Qian not know that the "heroic" sentence he quoted is a trick used by British and American politicians to deceive people? Does he not realize at all that he is speaking for another class? I think he knows it, he clearly knows what kind of role he played during that period when the rightists were frantically attacking. If he still wants to cover himself up, insisting that he has not done anything, that he is a good old man, only with a little bit of anti-Party ideology, can we believe it?
    After reading Xiao Qian's articles and knowing what Xiao Qian has done, we feel that Xiao Qian is like the kind of person who secretly puts poison in the well water. He wants to put poison, but he is afraid of being caught, so he always leaves himself a way out and pretends to be a good person. However, this guilty poisoner has finally been caught by the people and seen through by us. He and Zhang Yousong jointly wrote an article "Diary of Being Muzzled", the title of this article can explain their conspiracy. They wanted to muzzle the people, they wanted to pull the people back from today's bright and happy day to the dark old society where people's voices could not be heard.
    At the debate meeting on Xiao Qian, I heard the comrades' exposure of Xiao Qian, those facts really made us extremely angry. He, a Chinese, how could he regret that the Eight-Power Allied Forces of the imperialists in the Boxer Rebellion did not jointly administer China! He, a Chinese, how could he scold his compatriots as "stupid, dirty, selfish, cruel", using all kinds of ugly words to curse his country and people! He, a Chinese, how could he praise the imperialist elements of the American consulate as "He is not a human, he is a god!" This is precisely the comprador politician that all patriotic people hate. In the past, he posed as a "liberal", implementing the anti-Soviet and anti-communist "middle line", carrying out many two-faced activities. The Party "tolerated" him, united him, trusted him, and gave him a very important position, allowing him to serve the people well. The Party put aside everything from his past and only hoped that he would accept the Party's education from now on. But what did he say? He said: "Staying in the doghouse for a long time, without dog nature, also loses human nature." Xiao Qian, only an inhuman person can say such a thing as you!
    His ex-wife, Comrade Mei Tao, said that Xiao Qian has always been straddling two boats in his life, never missing. His motto is to prepare for the worst and hope for the best. Everyone wants to know what "bad" he is preparing for? What "good" is he hoping for?
    Xiao Qian, you person who straddles two boats, you, with one foot on the Communist Party's boat, whose boat is your other foot on?

    斥洋奴政客萧乾
    曹禺
    萧乾是文化界熟识的人，他很聪明，能写作，中、英文都好。但是他有一个毛病，就是圆滑、深沉，叫人摸不着他的底。过去，他曾在混水里钻来钻去，自以为是龙一样的人物，然而在今天的清水里，大家就看得清清楚楚，他分明是一条泥鳅了。
    今年5、6月间，“中国的天空上黑云乱翻”的时候，他忽然露出头来，兴风作浪，拉拢这个，打击那个。他拉拢的是反党、反社会主义、阴谋篡夺党的领导的个人野心家们，他打击的是忠心耿耿、保卫党的事业的人。他还写了一些诽谤党、党员作家和新社会的文章，他集中火力对人民文学出版社，对“译文”，对“文艺报”进行攻击。他在这个期间，四处点火，进行了一系列的反党活动。
    我们都知道他的过去，他在“大公报”和“新路”上所写的那些反共、反苏的文章我们还没有忘记。这是一个有历史的、有阴谋的右派分子。今天，大家已经完全把他看出来了。
    大家说他是个泥鳅，这在他的文章里也看得出来。我们批判萧乾，就指出他的短处、缺点、错误，爽朗地批评他，希望他能够重新变成一个好人，一个正直的人，不打歪算盘的人。但是，他写起文章来就要曲曲弯弯，先说许多好听的话，然后再骂你。他仿佛是那种能笑着骂人的人。你说他笑吧，他却是狠狠地骂你；你说他骂吧，他说：“我分明是在善意地对你笑着哩。”
    我们不喜欢这种笑着骂人的办法。但是，在他的文章里，对党和今天的社会是采取了这样的战术的。
    拿他在6月1号人民日报上发表的“放心·容忍·人事工作”一篇文章作例吧。
    通篇看来，他明明是反对马列主义，企图用资产阶级的所谓“民主精神”来代替马克思主义的思想领导，但他偏要举起双手，热烈拥护地说，马克思主义本身具有不可抗拒的吸引力，大家会自觉地接受真理。明明他歪曲事实，污蔑地说，今天的中国人没有说话和写作的自由，但他就在这句话的前面，满怀恶意地冷笑道：“解放以来，每个中国人都可以自豪地说，我们的政府从来也没下命令查禁过一本书。”明明他堆着一脸笑容，希望大家用资产阶级的立场、观点来“独立思考”，“自由选择”，然而他偏把自己打扮成一个马克思主义的忠实追随者，骂党的领导是“拿马列主义当棍子使用的教条主义者”，“把马列主义神秘化，庸俗化”，“逼人家对政治起反感”。
    他怎样诬蔑今天党的领导呢？
    他说，教条主义的领导好比是螳螂前面的车轮。而螳螂呢，就指的是他所谓不能“独立思考”的文艺工作者。教条主义者的车轮又那样无情，许多人都被辗死在它的下面了。于是，他接着就说，问题的关键在于，领导对文艺工作者不够
  “放心”。要对文艺工作者“放心”，让他们“自由地”放，这才能够做到“百花齐放”的“放”。
    这分明是对党在文艺工作中的领导的仇视与歪曲。党从来没有对爱国的、拥护社会主义的革命文艺工作者不放心过。多少非党的文艺工作者领导着重要的文艺机构和刊物，他们在党的领导下做了很多工作，成绩显著。他们从来没有说过，党对他们不放心。但是，萧乾忽然以一个仗义者的面孔出现了。一会儿说，党在“杀鸡吓猴”，一会儿说，党不许人独立思考，一会儿又说，党的领导对人不放心。处心积虑地挑拨离间，他的用意是在，使文艺工作者不相信党，远远离开党，要使大家跟他一样相信：党在文艺界的领导是“教条主义的统治”。他对党是这样的势不两立，却偏要做出一副正人君子仗义执言的面孔。“镜花缘”的“两面国”里的人都有两个脸，前面微笑，后面喷着毒气，萧乾就是这种两面三刀的“好汉”。
    然而，就在这样恶毒的攻击里，他却狡诈地布置下许多退路。在那篇文章里，他一面骂，今天的社会“把政治庸俗化”，一面又用两面派的手法，埋伏一笔：“在我们的社会里，有浓厚的健康的政治空气。”明明他赞同资本主义的那种虚伪的“容忍”，他又偏要向大家卖好地说：“资本主义国家的政府对他们的文化人是放心不下的。”说：“英美这两个自诩为‘民主的’国家，在这个‘容忍’的考验的面前早就破了产。”现在我们倒要问问萧乾，你倒底认为英美是“民主”，还是“不民主”？我们替你说出来吧，无论你在我们面前怎样装疯卖傻，步步设防，骂英美怎样的“不民主”，心里却很向往这个“民主”，过去你的文章证明你是这样，今天你的文章证明你还是这样。
    谈到“容忍”，他说，他要我们采取他所谓的“民主精神”。他说，“应该容忍你不喜欢的人，应该容忍你不喜欢的话”，这叫“民主精神”。他引用了一句极漂亮的话，那句话是：“我完全不同意你的看法，但是我情愿牺牲我的性命，来维护你说出这个看法的权利。”其实，这句话是一种戏法，是语言的魔术，因为这句话没有真实的根据。谁都看得出来，这是资产阶级骗人的一句鬼话。国民党统治时期，国民党自称为“最民主、最自由”的时期，我们的革命者所受的残酷压迫和屠杀已经完全证明，萧乾所引用的这句话是毫无心肝的谎言。然而，那个时候我们没有看见萧乾引用过这句“名言”。在那个时候，他并没有对共产党说：“我完全不同意你的看法，但我——萧乾，情愿牺牲我的性命，来维护你说出这个看法的权利。”然而今天，他却洋洋得意地引出了这句“名言”，并且对我们说：“这是一句非常豪迈的话。”我看，这句话一点也不豪迈，在那些英国绅士们的嘴里是一句骗人的漂亮话，但是今天出在萧乾的嘴里，便是一句别有用心、十分险恶的话了。果然，他就进一步诬蔑，每个中国人没有说话、写作的自由；果然，他暗指肃反，歪曲地说：“在维护宪法的名义下，干出实质上是违背宪法的事。”
    老实说，我们是最讲容忍的。只要他拥护党，拥护社会主义，哪怕有多少错误、缺点，我们总是一面容忍，一面教育，希望他改正过来。但是，我们也有绝对不能容忍的人，绝对不能容忍的话，那就是章罗和其他右派分子，以及他们到处散布的反党、反社会主义的言论。萧乾要我们对敌人表现他所谓的“民主精神”，让他们“自由”地动社会主义之根，摇共产党之本；萧乾要我们“容忍”章伯钧、罗隆基、储安平这类人，那我们就要对萧乾说：“不许你乱说乱动！”
    萧乾难道不知道，他引用的那句“豪迈”的话是英美政客骗人的把戏吗？难道他一点也不意识到，他是在替另外一个阶级在说话吗？我想他是知道的，他清清楚楚地知道，他在那段右派猖狂进攻的时候，扮演的是怎样一种角色。如果他还要掩饰自己，硬说自己并没有做什么，自己是一个好好先生，仅仅有一点点反党思想而已，我们能相信吗？
    读了萧乾的文章，知道了萧乾做的事情，我们感觉到，萧乾就像那种偷偷在井水里放毒的人。他要放毒，又怕被人抓到，处处先给自己留退路，装好人。然而，这个放毒的罪人终于被人民抓住了，被我们看破了。他和张友松合谋写过一篇“封嘴记”，这篇文章的题目，就可以说明他们的阴谋。他们是想封人民之口，他们要把人民从光明幸福的今天，拉回到那听不见人的声音的，黑洞洞的旧社会里。
    在对萧乾的辩论大会上，我听了同志们对萧乾的揭露，那些事实真使我们愤怒极了。他，一个中国人，怎么能惋惜，庚子年帝国主义的八国联军竟然没有共管中国！他，一个中国人，怎么能把自己的同胞，骂成“愚蠢、肮脏、自私，残酷”，用一切丑恶的字眼，来咒骂自己的国家和人民！他，一个中国人，怎么能把美国领事馆的帝国主义分子称颂为“他哪是人，他是神仙啊！”这正是一切爱国的人所痛恨的洋奴政客。他在过去以“自由主义者”自居，执行反苏、反共的“中间路线”，进行了多少两面派的活动，党都“容忍”了他，还团结他，信任他，给他十分重要的职务，让他好好为人民服务。党把他的过去的一切丢下不谈，只希望他从此接受党的教育。但是，他说什么呢？他说：“在狗窝里呆久了，没有狗性，也失去了人性”。萧乾，只有一个毫无人性的人才能说出你这种话！
    他的前妻梅韬同志讲，萧乾一生为人做事都脚踏两只船，从不落空。他的格言是，准备最坏的，希望最好的。大家都想知道，他准备的“坏的”是什么？希望的“好的”是什么？
    萧乾，你这脚踏两只船的人，你这只脚踩着共产党的船，你那只脚踩着谁的船？
