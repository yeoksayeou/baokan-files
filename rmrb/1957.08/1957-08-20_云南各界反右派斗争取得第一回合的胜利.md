Special Article: This is a special dispatch from the New China News Agency. Yunnan Province has achieved a first-round victory in the struggle against bourgeois rightists from all walks of life.

    The rightists in Yunnan Province include four types of people: First, feudal remnants, such as Long Yun's era's constitutional police commander and big local tyrant landlord Lu Guofan, who were the most vehement in attacking the cooperative movement; second, reactionary bureaucratic politicians, such as Gong Zizhi, the person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Organization of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, and Yang Kecheng, the person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Organization of the China Democratic National Construction Association. They formed small cliques to plot attacks against the Communist Party, openly demanding that the Communist Party's leadership be in a "transcendental position"; third, a group of anti-communist experts cloaked in the guise of scholars, such as Qin Zan, chairman of the Kunming branch of the Jiusan Society, and Miao Tianbao, Qin Fengxiang and others, who attempted to usurp the Party's leadership over cultural, educational and scientific and technological departments. In addition, there are some children of exploiting classes who harbor deep class hatred. The reactionary words and deeds of these rightists have now been fully exposed and they are completely isolated among the masses.

    The anti-rightist struggle in Yunnan Province first began in the democratic parties, industrial and commercial circles, educational circles, and state organs, and has now spread to the literary and art circles, the press and publishing circles, the health circles, and the scientific and technological circles.

    Through this struggle, the masses' awareness has generally been raised, and the middle elements are increasingly leaning towards the Party. After criticizing simplistic and crude methods and sentimentalism, the struggle has developed more healthily. In the past half-month, various units have successively exposed a new batch of rightists, including some traitors within the Party. At present, the struggle is continuing to develop in depth.

    云南各界反右派斗争取得第一回合的胜利
    本报特约新华社稿　云南省各界反击资产阶级右派分子的斗争，第一回合已经取得了胜利。
    云南的右派分子中包括四种人：一是封建余孽，如龙云时代的宪兵司令、大恶霸地主禄国藩等人，他们对合作化运动攻击最狠；二是反动官僚政客，如民革云南省组织的负责人龚自知和民建云南省组织的负责人杨克成等人，他们分别结成小集团，策划向共产党进攻，公然要共产党的领导处于“超然地位”；三是一群披着学者外衣的反共专家，如九三学社昆明分社主任委员秦瓒和苗天宝、秦凤翔等人，他们企图篡夺党对文教和科学技术部门的领导权。此外，还有一些深怀阶级仇恨的剥削阶级的子弟。这些右派分子的反动言行目前已被充分揭露，在群众中完全孤立。
    云南省的反右派斗争最早从民主党派、工商界、教育界和国家机关开始，现在已经遍及到文艺界、新闻出版界、卫生界和科学技术界。
    通过这场斗争，群众的觉悟普遍有了提高，中间分子也愈益向党靠拢。在批判了简单粗糙的作法和温情主义以后，斗争就更加健康地发展。最近半月以来，各单位又陆续揭露出一批新的右派分子，其中包括一些党内的叛徒。目前斗争正在继续深入发展。
