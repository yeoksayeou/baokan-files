Xinhua News Agency, August 3rd: Due to the continued exposure at the news workers' symposium held over the past two days, Chu Anping has begun to make some revelations about the anti-Party activities of the Zhang-Luo alliance and himself, but his overall account is still extremely dishonest.

According to Chu Anping's confession, Zhang Bojun "had a plan in his belly" regarding the personnel arrangements to thoroughly alter the political direction of Guangming Daily. After Chu Anping took office as editor-in-chief of Guangming Daily, Zhang Bojun planned to further appoint Chu Anping as the vice president of Guangming Daily and have the right-wing "theoretician" Chen Xingui serve as the editor-in-chief of Guangming Daily. On the eve of Zhang Bojun's convening of the "Six Professors Meeting," Zhang Bojun and Fei Xiaotong gathered with Chu Anping at Guangming Daily. That day, they talked about "the serious situation" and "the students are going to make trouble." Zhang Bojun said, "If the Communist Party dispatches troops, it will slap itself in the face," and he advocated that the democratic parties should quickly come forward to "help."

Chu Anping said that when he visited Luo Longji in early April, Luo told Chu Anping that "the constitution needs to be revised" and believed that there were many problems with the country's political system and the Five-Year Plan, and that Chu should organize "experts" to discuss them in the newspaper. According to a written exposure presented at the meeting, Chu Anping asked Luo Longji to publish articles on the above aspects at that time. Luo said that it was "inconvenient" for him to write, and Chu immediately asked Luo whether he could write himself. Luo said he could. It can be seen that the Zhang-Luo alliance's conspiracy to use the fallacy of "the Party's world" as a poisonous arrow to attack the Party had been planned for a long time.

Chu Anping confessed that when he visited Qian Weichang, a key member of the Zhang-Luo alliance, in late May, Qian Weichang asked him what Chairman Mao's bottom line was regarding the blooming and contending. Qian also told Chu that not only were there many problems among the great intellectuals, but also in the engineering and technical circles and in middle and primary schools, "there are also many opinions," and he suggested that Guangming Daily immediately organize a forum to ignite the fire. Subsequently, Qian Weichang personally led Chu Anping to see the big-character posters at Tsinghua University. He also said that when he and Qian Weichang exchanged opinions, he planned to mainly attack "sectarianism," while Qian Weichang mainly opposed the so-called "laymen leading experts," cooperating in attacking the Party wildly.

In Chu Anping's confession, he also mentioned that Peng Zigang had recruited people from Dagong Daily for Chu and personally introduced "cadres" to him in order to help him realize his plan to reorganize Guangming Daily. After Chu Anping's fallacy of "the Party's world" was published, Peng Zigang called Chu Anping twice, saying that Pu Xixiu was looking around for people to "support" him, and told him that Fei Xiaotong had expressed his opinion on his problem, saying that "the road is slippery and difficult to travel."

Although Chu Anping confessed to certain facts at today's meeting, his overall confession was still evasive and hesitant, avoiding directly talking about the anti-Party political conspiracy of the Zhang-Luo alliance.

Gao Ji of People's Daily, Yu Youda of Guangming Daily, and Wang Yunsheng of Dagong Daily, among others, exposed Chu Anping's dishonest attitude with a large number of facts in their speeches.

    章罗联盟如何篡夺光明日报
    储安平开始吐露了一点事实
    据新华社3日讯　由于两天来举行的新闻工作者座谈会的继续揭发，储安平对章罗联盟和他本人的反党活动开始作了某些吐露，但其整个交代仍极不老实。
    据储安平交代，章伯钧对彻底篡改光明日报政治方向的人事安排，“肚子里早有文章”。在储安平到光明日报任职总编辑后，章伯钧曾准备进一步任命储安平为光明日报的副社长，由右派“理论家”陈新桂出任光明日报总编辑。在章伯钧召集“六教授会议”前夕，章伯钧和费孝通曾到光明日报与储安平聚会。那天，他们就曾谈到
  “形势严重”，“学生要闹事”。章伯钧说“共产党如出动军队就给自己打了花脸”，他主张民主党派要赶快出面“帮忙”。
    储安平说，他4月初去看罗隆基，罗当时就告诉储安平说，“宪法要提出修改”，并认为国家的政治制度和五年计划都有很多问题，要储在报纸上组织“专家”讨论。据会上有人提出的书面揭发，储安平当时曾请罗隆基就上述方面发表文章，罗说他“不便”写，储当即请示罗，他自己是否可以写，罗表示可以。可见章罗联盟以“党天下”的谬论作为向党进攻的一枝毒箭的阴谋，本是久有策划。
    储安平交代，在他5月下旬去访问章罗联盟的首要分子钱伟长时，钱伟长曾问他毛主席关于鸣放的底究竟如何？钱还对储说不仅大知识分子中问题很多，并且工程技术界和中、小学里“意见也很多”，他建议光明日报立即组织座谈，进行放火。随后，钱伟长又亲自带领储安平去看清华大学的大字报。他还说他和钱伟长交换意见时，他准备主要攻击“宗派主义”，而钱伟长主要反对所谓“外行领导内行”，在向党猖狂进攻中分工合作。
    在储安平的交代中，他还谈到彭子冈曾替储到大公报拉人，亲自给他介绍“干部”，以便帮助其实现改组光明日报的计划。在储安平的“党天下”的谬论发表后，彭子冈曾两次给储安平打电话，说浦熙修正在四处找人为他“声援”，并且告诉他，费孝通对他的问题表示了意见，说是“路滑难行”。
    储安平虽然在今天的会上交代了某些事实，但他的整个交代仍然是避重就轻，吞吞吐吐，避免直接谈到章罗联盟的反党政治阴谋。
    人民日报高集、光明日报于友和大公报王芸生等人，在发言中以大量事实揭露了储安平交代中的不老实态度。
