Refute the Fallacies of Zeng Xianpu and His Like with Facts
Wang Shou, Director of the Grain Crop Production General Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture

During the rectification campaign, rightists in the agricultural sector, such as Zeng Xianpu (Deputy Director of the Economic Crop Production General Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture) and Shen Zengkan, clamored that significant problems existed with changes to the agricultural cultivation system, asserting that there were only shortcomings and no achievements. Like other rightists, Zeng Xianpu's conspiracies and insidious schemes to attack the Party were extremely vicious. They relentlessly sought out certain shortcomings in our work, amplifying and generalizing them, negating achievements, and exaggerating shortcomings to use as weapons to attack the Party. Now, let us examine whether the achievements of agricultural cultivation system changes are primary, or whether the shortcomings are primary?

1956 was a year of significant natural disasters. The area affected by floods and droughts nationwide reached 240 million mu, nearly double that of 1955. However, the total grain output not only did not decrease but increased by 15.4 billion jin compared to 1955. Of course, there were many reasons for the increased production. Besides the increased enthusiasm of farmers brought about by the high tide of collectivization, the widespread implementation of technical reforms, the expansion of land utilization, and the Party's strengthened leadership over agricultural production, changes to the cultivation system were the main guarantee for increased grain production.

For example, in 1956, the area of single-season rice converted to double-season rice increased by more than 32 million mu compared to 1955, the area of intercropped rice converted to continuous cropping increased by more than 7 million mu, and the area of indica rice converted to japonica rice increased by more than 11 million mu. The total area of these three reforms was three times larger than the cumulative area of the previous three years. In 1956, the rice output in the main producing areas— Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces—decreased by 2 billion jin due to typhoon attacks on the intermediate rice crop. Hunan and Jiangxi suffered drought on more than 30 million mu of intermediate rice, with more than 3 million mu yielding no harvest. Under such severe disaster conditions, the total output still increased by 8.9 billion jin of rice compared to 1955.

In 1956, all provinces universally carried out technical reforms, and the achievements were also significant. For example, Jiangxi Province promoted "three changes," increasing grain production by more than 300 million jin; Anhui Province promoted "three reforms," increasing grain production by 1.2 billion jin; Hubei Province promoted "five reforms," increasing grain production by more than 800 million jin; and Guangdong Province expanded the winter planting area, increasing grain production by more than 1.4 billion jin compared to 1949.

In 1956, certain achievements were also made in increasing the planting of high-yield crops, potatoes, corn, and japonica rice. In 1956, the area of potatoes expanded by 14 million mu, the area of corn expanded by 44 million mu, and the area of japonica rice expanded by 11 million mu. In general, in areas with suitable conditions, adequate technology, and appropriate varieties, production generally increased.

All these facts demonstrate that the Party has made great achievements in leading the reform of the cultivation system. Of course, due to bureaucracy and subjectivism in our work, there were also many shortcomings. It is precisely because there are shortcomings in the work that the Party is conducting a rectification campaign to improve the work. However, the rightists have ulterior motives, negating achievements and exaggerating shortcomings in an attempt to undermine the Party's leadership. This is something we cannot tolerate. We are determined to wage a struggle against the rightists and will not be satisfied until their frenzied attacks are repelled.

### 用事实驳斥曾宪朴之流的谬论

　　用事实驳斥曾宪朴之流的谬论
　　农业部粮食作物生产总局局长　王绶
    在整风当中，农业部门的右派分子曾宪朴（农业部经济作物总局副局长）、沈曾侃等大肆叫嚣说：农业改变耕作制度，问题很大，没有成绩只有缺点。曾宪朴同其他右派分子一样，向党进攻的阴谋诡计是非常毒辣的，他们无孔不入地寻找我们工作中的某些缺点，把它扩大化，概括化，否定成绩夸大缺点，作为向党进攻的武器。现在让我们来检查看看，到底农业改变耕作制度成绩是主要的呢，还是缺点是主要的？
    1956年是自然灾害很大的一年，全国水旱灾害的面积，达两亿四千万亩，比1955年扩大近一倍。而粮食的总产量不仅没有减少，反而比1955年增加一百五十四亿斤。当然，增产的原因很多，除了因合作化高潮带来农民的生产积极性，普遍进行技术改革，扩大土地利用率，党加强对农业生产领导力量等因素之外，改变耕作制度是粮食增产的主要保证。
    举例来说，1956年单季稻改双季稻的面积，比1955年增加三千二百多万亩，间作稻改连作稻增加七百多万亩，籼稻改粳稻增加一千一百多万亩。三项改革的总面积，比前三年的累计面积大三倍。1956年的水稻产量，在主要产区——苏、浙、皖三省，因台风侵袭，中稻减产二十亿斤；湖南、江西中稻受旱三千多万亩，其中有三百多万亩颗粒无收，在这样严重灾害的情况下，而总产量仍比1955年增产稻谷八十九亿斤。
    1956年各省都普遍的进行了技术改革，成绩也是很大的。例如江西省推行“三变”，增产粮食三亿多斤；安徽省推行“三改”，增产粮食十二亿斤；湖北省推行“五改”，增产粮食八亿多斤；广东省扩大冬种面积，比1949年增产粮食十四亿多斤。
    1956年在增种高产作物、薯类、玉米和粳稻，也取得一定成绩。1956年薯类扩大一千四百万亩，玉米扩大四千四百万亩，粳稻扩大一千一百万亩。总的说，在条件适宜，技术跟得上，选用品种得当的地区，一般都增产了。
    所有这些事实都说明，党在领导改制问题上是有很大成绩的。当然由于工作中还有官僚主义和主观主义，缺点也是不少的。正由于工作中有缺点，所以党才进行整风，改进工作。但是右派分子别有用心，否定成绩，夸大缺点，希图打击党的领导。这是我们不能容忍的。我们坚决要向右派分子进行斗争，不打退他们的猖狂进攻，决不甘心。
