Xinhua News Agency, July 7th: The Central Disaster Relief Committee held its first meeting this afternoon, listening to a report by Xie Juezai, Vice Chairman of the Central Disaster Relief Committee and Minister of the Interior, on the national disaster situation and disaster area production and relief work.

Xie Juezai said that if no major disasters occur in the next month, the affected area and the affected population this year will be lighter compared to 1954 and 1956. At the same time, the main areas flooded this year were not high-yield grain areas. This year's wheat harvest was also relatively good. This year, the autumn floods came early and receded quickly, and most areas can now replant late autumn crops in a timely manner.

The meeting called on all localities to strengthen overall leadership of disaster area work, continue to fight floods, properly resettle disaster victims, pay attention to the medical and health work of disaster victims, actively solve the difficulties of disaster victims in rebuilding their homes and restoring production, do a good job in rescuing submerged crops and replanting and replanting, and drought-resistant autumn protection work in drought-stricken areas, and rationally use relief funds.

The reporter learned that this year, especially after the rainstorms in Shandong and Henan provinces caused disasters, the state has allocated more than 180 million yuan in relief funds to various places. The state has also mobilized sea, land, and air transportation to transport large quantities of relief materials to the disaster areas, so the rescue work in the flooded areas with accumulated water and waterlogging was done relatively timely, and now the disaster victims in the two provinces have generally been resettled.

    今年灾情比去年轻
    灾区工作还须加强领导
    谢觉哉谈全国灾情和救灾工作
    据新华社7日讯　中央救灾委员会今天下午举行第一次会议，听取了中央救灾委员会副主任、内务部部长谢觉哉关于全国灾情和灾区生产救灾工作问题的报告。
    谢觉哉说，只要在今后一个月内不再发生大灾，今年受灾的面积和受灾的人口同1954年和1956年相比，是较轻的。同时，今年主要被淹的不是粮食高产区。今年麦收收成也较好。今年秋季水来得早、退得快，目前大部分地区已可以及时补种晚秋作物。
    这次会议要求各地加强对灾区工作的全面领导，再接再厉的进行防汛斗争，妥善安置灾民，重视灾民的医疗卫生工作，积极解决灾民在重建家园、恢复生产中的困难，作好抢救被淹农作物及进行补种抢种和受旱地区的抗旱保秋工作，以及合理使用救济款。
    记者获悉，今年，特别是山东、河南等省暴雨成灾后，国家先后下拨各地的救济款已达一亿八千多万元。国家还动员海、陆、空交通工具将大批救生物资源源运到灾区，因而积雨内涝被淹的地区抢救工作作得比较及时，现在两省灾民一般都得到了安置。
