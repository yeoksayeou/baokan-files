Lanzhou, August 21st (reported by this newspaper) - Gansu Province's work on streamlining organizations and reducing staffing, which began last winter, has been proceeding actively. According to the original streamlining plan, the province should reduce staffing by 22,042 people. Up to now, 12,000 people have been processed, of which 10,039 have returned to industrial and agricultural production posts, 613 are in reserve for training, and the rest have been reassigned to other work.

　　The work of handling redundant personnel is complex and meticulous. Most units have been able to achieve the "three not to leave": those who are not ideologically clear should not be asked to leave, those whose difficulties have not been resolved should not be asked to leave, and those whose future paths have not been properly arranged should not be asked to leave. The Tianshui Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on the specific situation of each redundant person, put forward eighteen handling methods, so that each redundant person could happily take up a new job. Most localities have handled the retirement procedures for the redundant personnel who have been processed in accordance with the regulations of the State Council, issued retirement pay, and also provided some people with production subsidies as appropriate. In order to take care of the special circumstances of some people, various localities have also developed various service industries as well as pig raising, chicken raising, and medicinal herb digging, etc., according to local conditions. Great importance has also been attached to the follow-up work. Many areas have organized people to visit returning personnel at their homes, hold forums to listen to opinions, and further help them solve various difficulties.

　　At present, all parts of the province are actively handling other redundant personnel. The policy remains to mobilize them to return to production posts. Efforts are being made to complete this work entirely before the end of September.

　　甘肃省整编工作有成绩
  　一万二千编余人员都愉快地走上新岗位
    本报兰州21日电　甘肃省的精简机构、紧缩编制工作，从去年冬季开始，始终是积极地进行着。根据原整编方案，全省应精简二万二千零四十二人。到现在为止，已处理了一万二千人，其中回到工、农业生产岗位的一万零三十九人，储备训练的六百一十三人，其他是调整工作。
    处理编余人员的工作是复杂的，细致的。大部分单位都能做到“三不走”：思想不通的不叫走，困难没有解决的不叫走，出路没有找妥的不叫走。中共天水地委，曾根据编余人员个人的具体情况，提出了十八条处理办法，使每一个编余人员都能愉快地走上新的工作岗位。各地对已经处理的编余人员，大都按照国务院规定办了退职手续，发给退职金，还酌情发给一些人生产补助金。为了照顾某些人的特殊情况，各地方还因地制宜地发展了各种服务性行业以及养猪、养鸡、挖药材等生产。对善后工作也十分重视。许多地区曾组织人登门访问回乡人员，召开座谈会听取意见，进一步帮助他们解决各种困难。
    现在，全省各地正在积极处理其他的编余人员，方针仍然是动员他们返回生产岗位。争取在9月底以前，全部完成这项工作。
