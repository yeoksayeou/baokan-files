　　Using Old Cloth Bags　Taking Fewer Work Clothes
　　Shenyang and Fushun Workers Actively Save Cotton Cloth
　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 22nd - Workers in Shenyang, Fushun and other cities support the state's measures to reduce cotton cloth supply.
　　Many workers in Shenyang City, after seeing the news in the newspaper about the State Council's reduction in cotton cloth supply, held various meetings that day to express their determination to take the lead in saving cotton cloth as masters of the country. Li Chunguan, a production committee member of the Shenyang Transformer Factory's trade union, immediately dismissed the idea of making new cotton-padded clothes for the winter after hearing the broadcast on the 19th. He took apart his old cotton clothes that night and sent them to the dyeing factory the next day to be washed and dyed, preparing to renovate them. All the workers in the melting section of the foundry workshop of the Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Plant decided that in the past, each person received two sets of work clothes a year, but in the future, they would only receive one set a year. Workers at the Shenyang Starch Factory said that in addition to completing the annual plan for saving industrial production cloth (which is currently 98% complete), they would take measures such as continuing to use old cloth bags and using fewer new cloth bags to save another 153,600 feet of industrial production cloth.
　　Workers at the Fushun No. 1 Petroleum Factory plan to save 74,000 feet of cotton cloth and more than 8,400 jin of cotton.

　　使用旧布袋　少领工作服
　  沈阳抚顺职工积极节省棉布
    新华社沈阳22日电　沈阳、抚顺等市职工拥护国家减少棉布供应的措施。
    沈阳市许多职工在报上看到国务院减少棉布供应的消息，当天便召开了各种会议，表示要以主人翁的身份带头节约棉布。沈阳变压器厂工会生产委员李春冠，19日夜里听到广播后，立即打消今冬做新棉袄的想法，当夜拆了旧棉衣，第二天送到染厂去洗染，准备翻新。沈阳第二机床厂铸工车间熔化工段全体工人决定：过去一年每人领两套工作服，今后一年只领一套。沈阳淀粉厂职工表示在完成全年节约工业生产用布计划（目前已完成了98％）外，采取继续使用旧布袋少用新布袋等办法，再节约工业生产用布十五万三千六百尺。
    抚顺石油一厂职工，计划节约七万四千尺棉布和八千四百多斤棉花。
