Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 26th: Shanghai rowing athletes broke three of the five national rowing records announced by the Sports Commission this January during the first rowing championships held on the 24th and 25th.

On the 24th, the Huangpu River was calm, with a current speed of less than 0.27 meters per second. The top eight finishers in the men's 2,000-meter coxed pair final all broke the national record of 9 minutes 48.4 seconds. The Teachers' Team (rowed by Jin Yaogui and Zhao Qingtang, steered by Pan Gaohai), which won first place, achieved a time of 8 minutes 3.8 seconds. The other seven teams that broke the national record were Gezhi Middle School, Hongkou Middle School, Light Industry, Tongji University, First Machine, Mixed, and Public Security, with the lowest time being 9 minutes 42.6 seconds.

In the men's 2,000-meter coxless double sculls preliminaries, three people broke the national record of 9 minutes 49 seconds. The three athletes who broke the national record were: national record holder Cheng Jundi, with a time of 8 minutes 44.4 seconds; Chen Xigang, a student from Shanghai Second Normal College, with a time of 9 minutes 16.7 seconds; and Cao Dejun, with a time of 9 minutes 44.8 seconds.

The men's 2,000-meter coxed eight final was held against the current. As a result, the Naval Aviation Team and the First Machine Team, composed of naval soldiers, broke the national record of 8 minutes 6.2 seconds with times of 7 minutes 33.6 seconds and 8 minutes 0.8 seconds, respectively. In the preliminary round, the Gezhi Middle School team achieved a time of 7 minutes 46.9 seconds, also breaking the national record.

In this women's competition, both the coxswain and the rowers were female athletes (because the coxswain was male at the 1956 rowing demonstration in Hangzhou last year, the results of the women's coxed events were not listed as official records). This time, the results for the 1,000-meter coxed four and the 1,000-meter coxed pair were 5 minutes 2 seconds and 5 minutes 22.3 seconds, respectively, which were 4.4 seconds and 51.4 seconds faster than the results of the demonstration competition last year when male athletes were the coxswains. These two new national records were both created by the Mixed Red Team (the four-person scull was rowed by Liu Dezi, Chen Yunxia, Qu Xiaotu, and Liu Debao, and steered by Shen Ruixi; the double scull was rowed by Tang Shunhua and Wang Changhua, and the coxswain was Su Zhaoyun).

A total of 256 athletes from 23 teams, including workers, students, and People's Liberation Army soldiers, participated in this rowing championship. (Attached picture)

### 黄浦江上赛艇飞驶　打破三项划船全国纪录

　　黄浦江上赛艇飞驶
　　打破三项划船全国纪录
    据新华社上海26日电　上海划船运动员24和25两日在第一次举行划船锦标赛时，把体育运动委员会今年1月公布的五项划船全国纪录打破了三项。
    24日黄浦江上风平浪静，流速每秒钟在零点二七公尺以下。获得男子两千公尺双人单桨赛艇（有舵手）决赛的前八名，都打破了九分四十八秒四的全国纪录。获得第一名的教工队（由金尧圭、赵庆堂握桨，潘高海掌舵）的成绩是八分三秒八。其他打破全国纪录的是格致中学、虹口中学、轻工业、同济大学、一机、混合和公安等七个队，其中成绩最低的是九分四十二秒六。
    男子两千公尺单人双桨赛艇（无舵手）在预赛时，就有三人打破了九分四十九秒的全国纪录。这三名打破全国纪录的运动员是：全国纪录保持者程骏迪，成绩八分四十四秒四；上海第二师范学院学生陈锡刚，成绩九分十六秒七；第三名曹德钧，成绩九分四十四秒八。
    男子两千公尺八人单桨赛艇（有舵手）决赛，是在逆流中进行的。结果，由海军战士组成的海航队和一机队分别以七分三十三秒六和八分零秒八的成绩，打破了八分六秒二的全国纪录。在预赛中，格致中学队的成绩是七分四十六秒九，也打破了全国纪录。
    这次女子比赛，舵手和握桨的都是女运动员（去年在杭州举行1956年划船表演赛时，因为是由男子掌舵，所以女子组各项有舵手比赛的成绩，都没有被列为正式纪录）。这次一千公尺四人单桨赛艇和一千公尺二人单桨赛艇的成绩，分别是五分二秒和五分二十二秒三，比去年表演赛中由男运动员掌舵的成绩，还分别提高了四秒四和五十一秒四。这两个全国新成绩都是混合红队创造的（四人单桨由刘德滋、陈云霞、瞿晓吐和刘德宝握桨，沈瑞熙掌舵；双人单桨由唐顺华和王长华握桨，舵手是苏肇允）。
    参加这次划船锦标赛的，共有工人、学生、解放军战士等二十三队的二百五十六个运动员。（附图片）
