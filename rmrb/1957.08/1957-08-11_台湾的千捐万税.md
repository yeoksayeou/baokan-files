    Taiwan's Thousand Donations, Ten Thousand Taxes
  　Fang Li
    The Chiang Kai-shek clique, in order to extricate itself from its increasingly strained financial situation, is even more frantically squeezing the marrow from the bones of the Taiwanese people. Just by opening the newspapers, large and small, throughout Taiwan, there is hardly one that does not publish advertisements urging the payment of taxes every day. Kuo Yuxin, a "member" of the Kuomintang's Taiwan Provincial "Temporary Assembly," recently publicly admitted that the people of Taiwan have reached the point of "changing color at the mention of taxes"; the tax burden "has already exceeded the saturation point." Jian Wen, the owner of a small eatery in Taiwan, recently wrote an article entitled "A Taxpayer's Grievance," saying, "Although my shop is small, I have to spend ten full days each month paying taxes!", and there are "endless tax items." He listed more than ten taxes that his small shop has to pay, including comprehensive income tax, business income tax, salary income tax, property tax, business tax, sales tax, license tax, house tax, banquet tax, rental tax, interest tax, and household tax. Many Taiwanese newspapers have acknowledged that the tax items in Taiwan are simply too numerous to calculate, and that even those with small incomes are invariably included as tax targets. One Taiwanese newspaper said, "Household tax is levied on almost every family," "Household donations and land value tax, even if you only have a small house or a small piece of land to stand on, entirely for your own residence, you have to bear those taxes and donations." A Taiwanese economic magazine revealed that tax revenue accounted for 85% of the Chiang Kai-shek clique's total fiscal revenue last year; the total tax revenue in Taiwan last year increased more than fifty-six times compared to 1949. The total amount of various taxes collected in Taipei City this year increased by more than 10% compared to last year, and the land value tax alone will be several tens of millions of Taiwan dollars more than last year. Chen Maobang, a "member" of the Taipei City "Temporary Assembly," recently revealed that the tax bureau demanded that an electrical appliance store in Taipei City with an annual turnover of only 110,000 Taiwan dollars pay 350,000 Taiwan dollars in income tax, and there are many similar cases. According to Taiwanese newspapers, due to tax officials using their power to embezzle money, extort bribes, seek revenge, and freeload, many Taiwanese taxpayers are forced to bear large additional burdens in addition to paying taxes.
    In order to suppress the Taiwanese people who refuse to pay exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, the Chiang Kai-shek clique has recently adopted brutal police measures. According to Taiwanese newspapers, the police in Kaohsiung City dispatched large numbers of officers, "chasing after tax arrears day and night, forcing citizens to the end of their rope." The police and courts in Yilan County "arrested tax defaulters on a large scale with trucks late at night. Some police officers handcuffed tax defaulters or used other cruel methods to embarrass them." Police stations in Taipei, Kaohsiung, Tainan, Taichung, and other places have sent many police officers to collect taxes door-to-door or to search for tax defaulters. (Xinhua News Agency)

    台湾的千捐万税
  　方力
    蒋介石集团为了解脱它在财政方面日益拮据的局面，正在更疯狂地向台湾人民敲骨吸髓。只要翻开台湾各地的大小报纸，几乎没有一家没有一天不登载有催缴税款的广告。国民党台湾省“临时议会”的“议员”郭雨新最近公开承认，今日台湾人民已经到了“谈税色变”的地步；税收负担“已经超过饱和点”。台湾一家小食店的主人健文，最近写了一篇题为“一个纳税人的怨言”的文章，他说：“敝号虽小，每月纳税的时间，总得花上十个整天！”，而且有“看不尽的税目”。他列举他那家小店要纳的税就有综合所得税、营利事业所得税、薪资所得税、财产税、行商税、营业税、牌照税、房捐税、筵席税、租赁税、利息税、户税等十多种。许多台湾报纸都承认台湾的税目简直多到无法计算，而且一般小收入者也毫无例外地列为收税对象。一家台湾报纸说：“户税几乎征到每一个家庭的头上”，“户捐和地价税，那怕你仅有一小幢房子、一小块立锥之地，完全由自己居住，你就得负担那些税捐”。台湾一家经济杂志透露，去年蒋介石集团的全部财政收入中，税收占85％；去年台湾的税收总额比1949年增加了五十六倍多。台北市今年全市各种税收的总额比去年增加了10％以上，仅地价税一项，今年即比去年多征台币数千万元。台北市“临时议会”的“议员”陈茂榜最近揭露，台北一家全年营业额不过台币十一万元的电器行，税务局竟然要它缴纳所得税三十五万元，而且类似的事例还有不少。据台湾报纸说，由于税务人员利用职权贪污发财、敲榨勒索、私仇公报、揩油吃喝，因而迫使台湾许多税户在纳税以外，还得背上大笔的额外负担。
    蒋介石集团为了镇压拒绝缴纳苛捐杂税的台湾人民，最近采用了残暴的警察措施。据台湾报纸说，高雄市的警察大批出动，“日夜追讨，迫得市民走头无路”。宜兰县的警察及法院“深夜用卡车大肆扣捕欠税人。有的警察对欠税人加铐，或用其他残忍方法使之难堪”。台北、高雄、台南、台中等地警察所都派出很多警员，挨家催缴捐税或是搜捕欠税人。（新华社）
