Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 10th. This is a report from our reporters Ye Shitao and Xu Lei: In the past month, a massive anti-rightist struggle has unfolded in Shanghai's art circles. Several thousand film, opera, music, and fine arts workers have held hundreds of meetings, large and small, to fiercely counterattack a group of rightists from the Shanghai China Democratic League (CDL) rightist group who were engaged in anti-Party conspiracies within art troupes.

The first step of the CDL rightist group to usurp leadership in Shanghai's literary and art circles was to develop organizations and expand their strength in various art troupes. Starting in the second half of last year, they used deceptive and despicable methods, such as claiming that joining the CDL would bring fame and facilitate joining the Party. In a few months, the number of CDL members in literary and art circles increased from fifty-two to two hundred and ninety. The majority of leading actors in major and medium-sized theaters were pulled into the CDL. The Shanghai Film Studio, Shanghai People's Art Theater, and Shanghai Chorus, among other units, hastily established CDL branches on the eve of the rectification campaign, manipulated by rightists, becoming the core of attacks against the Party.

These rightists, scattered in the art troupes, consistently harbored hatred for the Communist Party and possessed strong personal ambitions. As soon as the rectification campaign began, they did their utmost to spread rumors and slander, sow discord between the Party and the masses, and incite disturbances, attempting to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party. Rightists Zhang Lide and Zhang Manping (heads of the CDL branch) of the Shanghai People's Art Theater, while slandering the Communist Party leaders of the "People's Art Theater," secretly plotted to form "their own troupe." Zhang Lide appointed himself as the head, and Zhang Manping as the artistic leader, claiming that the funds would be supported by the CDL Municipal Committee. They even determined the theater for performances, plotting to split the "People's Art Theater."

Wu Yin and Xiang Kun, two rightists from the "Shanghai Film Studio" personally contacted by Chen Renbing, had been meticulously engaging in anti-Communist Party activities. Wu Yin loudly demanded the removal of the leadership of the Shanghai Film Studio at the Shanghai Municipal People's Political Consultative Conference. She attempted to organize a film studio led by the CDL, with Wu Yin's husband, Meng Junmou, as the director and Wu Yin as the director of the Arts Committee.

Zhou Zhongnan, a vocal music teacher at the Shanghai Chorus and a rightist, slandered Party member leaders as "secret agents, hooligans, who don't understand music and destroy art," saying that "things would be done much better without Party and League members." When the rectification campaign began, Chen Renbing personally appointed her as the director of the CDL branch of the chorus. She openly proposed: "Now the leadership is at a loss, and in the future, the CDL will come forward to handle the concerts."

Jiang Zhong was a rightist who took the lead in causing trouble in the Shanghai Wind Orchestra. During the blooming and contending period, incited by his godmother Wu Yin, he called himself a "steel cannon," even demanding the removal of the Party branch secretary of the Wind Orchestra, slandering Party and League members as "lacking both talent and virtue." He even arrogantly said to people: "If I become the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the head of the Wind Orchestra at the same time, I will promote everyone three levels and let you fly to the United States to perform."

The anti-Party faces of film screenwriter Ma Guoliang, director Zhao Guogu, Pingtan artist Huang Yian, painter Xi Baiye, and other rightists have also been exposed.

In the face of a large number of facts revealed by the masses, these rightists have made some preliminary confessions, but they are still denying and quibbling on many important issues, attempting to muddle through.

    上海几千文艺工作者召开了几百次大小会议
    牛头马面在正义面前纷纷现形
    新华社上海10日电　本社记者叶世涛、续磊报道：最近一个月来，上海艺术界展开了声势浩大的反右派斗争。数千名电影、戏曲、音乐和美术工作者，召开了几百次大大小小的会议，猛烈反击上海民盟右派集团在艺术团体中进行反党阴谋活动的一批右派分子。
    民盟右派集团篡夺上海文艺界领导权的第一步是在各文艺团体里发展组织、扩充实力。去年下半年起，他们用入盟可以出名、入盟便于入党等欺骗卑鄙手法，在几个月中，使文艺界的民盟盟员从五十二名发展到二百九十人，绝大部分大中剧团的主要演员都被拉入了民盟。上海电影制片厂、上海人民艺术剧院和上海合唱团等单位都在鸣放前夕匆促建立起民盟支部，由右派分子操纵，成为了向党进攻的核心。
    散布在文艺团体里的这些右派分子，都一贯仇视共产党，具有强烈的个人野心。整风一开始，他们就极力造谣污蔑，挑拨党群关系，煽动闹事，企图打垮共产党的领导。上海人民艺术剧院的右派分子张立德、章曼苹（民盟支部负责人）一面污蔑“人艺”共产党领导人，一面密谋另组“自己的剧团”，张立德自封团长，章曼苹为艺术领导，说经费由民盟市委支持，甚至都确定了演出的剧场，阴谋分裂“人艺”。
    陈仁炳亲自联系的“上影”两个右派分子吴茵、项坤一直处心积虑地进行反对共产党活动。吴茵在上海市政协会上大叫要撤换上影领导。她企图组织一个民盟领导的电影厂，由吴茵的丈夫孟君谋当厂长，吴茵担任艺术委员会主任。
    上海合唱团声乐教员、右派分子周仲南污蔑党员领导干部是“特务、流氓，不懂音乐、摧残艺术”，说“没有党团员工作要好做得多”。整风开始，陈仁炳亲自指定她做合唱团的民盟支部主任委员，她公然提出：“现在领导已经束手无策，以后音乐会由民盟出面来搞”。
    蒋忠是在上海管乐团带头闹事的右派分子，鸣放期间，在他干妈吴茵的煽动下自称“钢炮”，竟然要求撤去管乐团的党支部书记，污蔑党团员“无才无德”。他更狂妄地对人说：“我要做了外交部长兼管乐团团长，一定每人提升三级，让你们坐飞机到美国去演出。”
    电影编剧马国亮、导演赵国谷、评弹艺人黄异庵、画家膝白也等右派分子的反党面目也都被揭露出来。
    在群众揭发的大量事实面前，这些右派分子初步做了一些交代，但对许多重要问题仍然抵赖狡辩，企图蒙混过关。
