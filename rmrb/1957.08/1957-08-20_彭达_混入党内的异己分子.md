Peng Da—A Heterogeneous Element Mixed into the Party
Zheng Qimin Xue Hui

    In the Ministry of Supervision of the People's Republic of China, there is such a "character" who, from the day he started working in supervision, has used every opportunity for eight years as if it was a single day to try to usurp the leadership of supervision work, and used supervision work as a weapon to oppose the Communist Party, oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat, and oppose the socialist system. Who is this "character"? It is Peng Da, a class alien element who has been mixed into the Communist Party for nearly twenty years, who once deceived the Party's trust, and who stole the position of Deputy Director of the Second Division of the Ministry of Supervision.
    The anti-Party and anti-socialist methods adopted by this class alien element hidden within the Communist Party in the past were very covert. When the rectification campaign began and the right-wing elements outside the Party rampantly launched an attack on the Party, Peng Da took the opportunity to carry out activities, setting fires everywhere and inciting cadres of the supervisory organs to oppose the leadership of the Ministry of Supervision. It was at this time that Peng Da's true face of opposing the Party and opposing socialism was completely exposed.

    **Failure to Implement the Instructions and Resolutions of the Central Government and the Ministry of Supervision**

    Over the past few years, the Central Committee's instructions on supervision work, the resolutions of previous national supervision work conferences, and the decisions of the Party group of the Ministry of Supervision, as long as they did not suit Peng Da's wishes, he always tried his best to oppose them. He has consistently opposed the supervisory organs' inspection of accidents and cases, saying that "inspecting accidents and cases is 'locking the stable door after the horse is stolen,' 'cleaning up the mess,' 'has no positive significance,' and only plays the role of a 'police station' and 'fire brigade.'" He opposed the supervisory organs accepting citizens' reports and accusations and managing disciplinary work, saying that "people's letters are trivial and do not work," and even slandered the comrades who handled people's letters as "producing waste paper all day long." He also firmly advocated abolishing supervisory correspondents. In March 1956, the Central Committee decided that the system of supervisory organs should be dual leadership. Peng Da initially openly opposed this decision of the Central Committee, and then adopted the method of ostensibly complying but actually opposing, expressing his agreement with dual leadership at the enlarged meeting of the Party group, and expressing his views on how to implement dual leadership. However, after the meeting, he secretly carried out conspiracies behind the Party group's back, wooing others to oppose dual leadership. On December 6, he emphasized the benefits of vertical leadership at a meeting of all cadres of the Second Division, and during the Sixth National Supervision Work Conference, he spoke at a small group meeting of the First Ministry of Machine Building National Supervision Bureau about his so-called eight difficulties of dual leadership, and even slandered the Ministry of Supervision for "not being considerate of the difficulties below." After this meeting, the Central Committee approved the Ministry of Supervision's report on this meeting, but Peng Da always expressed dissatisfaction.

    **Attacking Leaders, Cultivating Cronies**

    In order to usurp the leadership of supervision work, Peng Da did not hesitate to consistently adopt the means of attacking leaders, excluding dissidents, cultivating cronies, and elevating himself in his work. In 1953, he had a conflict with Lu Fu (member of the Party group), the former Deputy Director of the First Division of the Second Bureau of the Central Supervisory Committee (now the Ministry of Supervision), and incited his cronies to resist Lu's leadership and openly refused to perform the work assigned by Lu. Tan Shengbin (member of the Party group), Assistant Minister of Supervision and former Director of the Second Division, emphasized the political and ideological nature of supervision work and the collective leadership of the division, so Peng ridiculed Tan and spread rumors among the cadres, slandering Tan as "talking politics without understanding business." When Wu Tieming, the current Director of the division, first came to work in the Second Division, Peng gave Wu a hard time, refusing to perform the work assigned by Wu. Peng made decisions and changes on his own initiative on many major issues in the division without consulting with Wu. He repeatedly expressed to others that he was very dissatisfied with his long-term position as deputy director.

    Peng Da attacked all leading cadres of the Ministry of Supervision who held different views from him. He arrogantly slandered that "the Party group of the Ministry of Supervision is a paper tiger that can be punctured with a single poke," and scolded the members of the Party group as "dead bureaucrats," "living from day to day, seeking temporary ease," and "being officials, taking money, and drawing circles." In order to elevate himself, Peng Da always described the leaders of the Ministry of Supervision as useless in his words, saying, "Now it is one level worse than another, that is, the Ministry of Supervision is not as good as the Supervision Bureau, the Supervision Bureau is not as good as the Supervision Office, who leads whom is worth considering," "The leaders of the Ministry of Supervision are weak and powerless, there are not many people who can do things, and the Assistant Minister is not necessarily stronger than the Director of the Division," "When the Director of the Division goes out to inspect work, the Director of the Division leads the Minister," and so on. On the other hand, he described himself as a "victorious general who is always victorious," and often boasted about his so-called "achievements" in supervision work, making others feel that "the leaders of the Ministry of Supervision are not good, only Peng Da is good."

    Peng Da was very disgusted with veteran cadres. He knew that veteran cadres were the leading backbone of the Party, and generally speaking, their political and ideological level was relatively high, and it was easier to detect or see through his anti-Party activities. Therefore, he always maliciously attacked veteran cadres, saying that veteran cadres were "jacks-of-all-trades," "white hats," "sleeve-waving teams," "living off their past achievements, and once they are finished, they are finished"; "The past achievements are qualifications and being able to talk about Marxism-Leninism" and so on. He slandered the responsible cadres of industrial and mining enterprises as "bears managing enterprises." As for young cadres, Peng Da only liked those who were good at acting according to his wishes and bragging and praising him; while those young cadres who disagreed with him or fought against his wrong words and deeds were arbitrarily reprimanded and attacked. Even worse, in order to realize his personal ambitions, Peng Da specially wooed some people with political and historical problems, and reused those cronies who were obedient to him as his "accomplices" in his work. These people breathed through the same nostril as Peng Da and relied on Peng Da's support; Peng Da relied on them to publicize and promote his set of anti-Party programs.

    **Using Every Opportunity to Publicize Anti-Party Arguments**

    Peng Da often used every opportunity he could, such as giving lectures at supervisory cadre training classes, attending meetings of various industrial national supervisory bureaus, going out to inspect work, and writing articles for newspapers and periodicals, to vigorously promote his set of propositions on supervision work that were completely opposed to the Party's policies. When he gave a speech at the Tianjin Industrial and Mining Supervision Cadre Training Class to promote vertical leadership, on the one hand, he said that the responsible cadres of industrial and mining enterprises were worthless; on the other hand, he said to the students: "Brothers, be bold, don't be afraid. You go back and tell the factory director that we will no longer be under your jurisdiction in the future." "You just do it when you go back, I, Peng Da, am big, if there is a problem, I will take responsibility." This is essentially instilling privileged thinking into supervisory cadres and inciting them to oppose the Party and government leaders of enterprises. After the Fifth National Supervision Work Conference, in order to distort the spirit of the Fifth Conference, Peng Da colluded with Chen Dazhi, deputy director of the Research Office and a rightist element, to convene a meeting of more than a dozen enterprise supervision office cadres. At the summary of the meeting, Peng Da attacked the past methods of supervision work as methods of "using bureaucracy to inspect bureaucracy," and tried his best to promote his so-called method of "following-the-team inspection," that is, purely technical inspection methods. After the meeting, Peng Da and Chen Dazhi colluded to organize articles in the journal "National Supervision Work" to publicize and promote them.

    **Opposing the Party's Fundamental Line, Attacking the Socialist System**

    Peng Da also openly opposed the Party's fundamental line, slandered and attacked certain responsible comrades of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, and even妄想to overthrow the socialist system.

    Peng Da has consistently advocated abolishing Marxism-Leninism as a guiding ideology. He often promoted reactionary remarks such as "whoever has business ability can lead" and "you can't eat by relying on politics" among supervisory cadres. He slandered the strengthening of political and ideological work repeatedly emphasized by the Party as "selling dog skin plaster," and openly scolded leading cadres as: "Eating by relying solely on politics," "Leaving business and talking emptily about politics." He believed that the conclusion of the Sixth National Supervision Work Conference was "full of politics, but without politics." He also opposed supervisory cadres learning Marxism-Leninism. In the three industrial and mining supervision cadre training classes he organized, except for the second semester, when the course "The First Five-Year Plan" was perfunctorily taught a few times, no political classes were taught. What was particularly serious was that even after the ministerial meeting made a decision on strengthening the political classes of the cadre training class, he still firmly refused to implement it. Peng Da's series of words and deeds was essentially using the emphasis on learning business as a guise to abolish the guiding ideology of Marxism-Leninism. He even openly spread the fallacy of "the Party is going to be abolished" to cadres who requested to do Party affairs work.

    Peng Da was also very disgusted with and opposed to the Party's mass line. Not only did he not advocate or publicize the Party's mass line; on the contrary, he often satirized and slandered it, saying things like "walking the mass line cannot solve problems" and so on. In his supervision work, he never relied on the masses to carry out his work, but always emphasized relying on individual business technical ability to solve problems. He did not believe in the wisdom of the masses, believed that the information reflected by the supervisory correspondents was fragmented and ineffective, and advocated abolishing them.

    Peng Da consistently undermined the Party's democratic centralism in his work, demanding extreme democracy from above and implementing personal dictatorship from below. He openly publicized: "Whoever's opinion is correct is the leader." "If the leadership does not adopt your opinion, you can organize fermentation below, create mass public opinion, and force the leadership to adopt your opinion." He also "encouraged" cadres to "think independently" and "not blindly follow," and fabricated examples saying that when he worked in the old liberated areas, the Central Committee issued an instruction, and during the discussion, everyone else agreed, but he raised a different opinion. A month later, the Central Committee revised the instruction, which was indeed consistent with his opinion. Peng Da consistently 독단 독행 acted arbitrarily in the work he led. In leading the work of the Second Division, he consistently opposed implementing collective leadership in the division and opposed establishing a division affairs meeting system. When the leadership pointed out to him that he should implement the principle of collective leadership, he openly resisted and said: "What the hell is collective leadership, I don't care about that."

    Peng Da also opposed the decision made by the Party's Eighth National Congress to "implement the system of the factory director responsible under the leadership of the Party committee in industrial and mining enterprises," and believed that implementing this decision was for the Party committee to take care of everything.

    Peng Da also maliciously attacked the suppression of counter-revolutionaries campaign, and opposed the practice of adopting the mass line in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries campaign. He denied the achievements of the Ministry of Supervision in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and slandered the suppression of counter-revolutionaries of the Second Division of the Ministry of Supervision as "artificially creating contradictions." He also slandered the leaders of the five-person group of the Ministry of Supervision as "overly执," and expressed his desire to be "况锺". He often attacked active elements in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and even scolded active elements in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries as "brainless." In order to woo one of the objects of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in the Second Division at that time, Peng Da actually leaked Party secrets to him, and instructed him to attack the Party on the issue of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries during the period of great blooming and contending.

    Peng Da's opposition to the Party's fundamental line and his fundamental purpose of abolishing the guiding ideology of Marxism-Leninism was to overthrow the socialist system. In his speech at the rectification study discussion meeting of all cadres of the Second Division on May 18, Peng Da directly attacked the socialist system and opposed the dictatorship of the proletariat. He first said: "Don't be superstitious about socialism." Then he said: "The socialist system is all good, this is just propaganda." "The socialist system has two sides, a good side and a bad side." "The dictatorship of the proletariat brings about bureaucracy."

    **Peng Da Was Originally a Class Alien Element Mixed into the Party**

    Why has Peng Da consistently engaged in evil activities against the Party and the people? As long as we carefully examine his history, the truth will become clear. As early as between 1936 and 1938, Peng Da successively served as a political instructor of the Suiyuan Province Anti-Communist Self-Defense Corps, a supervisor of the brigade, and a director of political training of the Fourth Regiment of the National Militia Corps. Such an expert who specializes in anti-Communist political work, but mixed into the revolutionary ranks in August 1938, and mixed into the Communist Party in September of the same year. In 1941, when Peng Da was working in Anbei County, he surrendered to the enemy and betrayed the revolution, causing the local Party organization to be destroyed. Later, he went to Yan'an, where he concealed this sinful history and mixed into the Communist Party. Since then, he has been hiding in the revolutionary ranks for a long time, secretly doing unspeakable deeds.

    After the vigorous anti-rightist struggle began, many comrades in the Ministry of Supervision and the National Supervision Bureau of the Central Industry gradually sharpened their eyes and raised their awareness. Therefore, they successively exposed Peng Da's many anti-Party words and deeds. Since July, under the leadership of the Party group, the cadres of the Ministry of Supervision have launched an encirclement and suppression of this rightist element in the Party. However, in the face of a large number of criminal evidence, Peng Da is still continuing to resist stubbornly. Where Peng Da will go, it is up to him to choose.

    彭达——混入党内的异己分子
    郑启民　薛辉
    在中华人民共和国监察部，有这样一个“人物”，他从作监察工作之日起，八年如一日地利用一切可乘的机会，企图篡夺监察工作的领导权，并以监察工作作武器，来反对共产党，反对无产阶级专政，反对社会主义制度。这个“人物”是谁呢？就是混入共产党内近二十年之久，曾骗得了党的信任，并窃取了监察部第二司副司长职位的阶级异己分子彭达。
    这个隐藏在共产党内的阶级异己分子过去所采用的反党反社会主义的手法是非常隐蔽的。整风开始，当党外的右派分子猖獗地向党发动进攻的时候，彭达就乘机进行活动，到处点火，煽动监察机关的干部反对监察部的领导。就在这个时候，彭达的反党反社会主义的真面目就彻底暴露了。
    不执行中央和监察部的指示和决议
    几年来，中央关于监察工作的指示和历次全国监察工作会议的决议以及监察部党组的决定，只要不合彭达的心意，他总是竭力反对。他一贯反对监察机关检查事故和检查案件，说什么“检查事故和案件是‘马后炮’、‘擦屁股’、‘没有积极意义’，只起‘派出所’、‘消防队’的作用”。他反对监察机关受理公民检举控告和管理惩戒工作，说什么“人民来信是鸡毛蒜皮，不起作用”，甚至诬蔑处理人民来信的同志是在整天“制造废纸”。他还坚决主张取消监察通讯员。1956年3月，中央决定监察机关的体制为双重领导，彭达对中央的这一决定，最初是公开反对，继而是采取阳奉阴违，两面三刀的手法，在党组扩大会上表示同意双重领导，并就如何贯彻双重领导发表了意见，但会后又背着党组进行阴谋活动，拉拢别人，反对双重领导。12月6日，他又在第二司全体干部会上强调垂直领导的好处，并在第六次全国监察工作会议期间，到第一机械工业国家监察局的小组会上大讲其所谓双重领导的八大苦处，甚至诬蔑监察部“不体贴下面的苦处”。在这次会议后，中央批准了监察部关于这次会议的报告，彭达始终表示不满。
    打击领导，培植亲信
    彭达为了篡夺监察工作的领导权，不惜一贯地在工作中采取打击领导，排斥异己，培植亲信，抬高自己的手段。1953年，他曾与前中央监察委员会（即现在的监察部）第二厅第一副厅长鲁夫（党组成员）闹对立，鼓动他的亲信反抗鲁的领导，公开拒绝执行鲁所分配的工作。监察部部长助理、原第二司司长谭生彬（党组成员）由于强调监察工作的政治思想性和司的集体领导，彭就对谭热讽冷嘲，并在干部中散布流言蜚语，诬蔑谭是“空谈政治，不懂业务”。现任司长吴铁鸣刚到二司工作时，彭就给吴来个下马威，拒不执行吴所分配的工作。关于司里许多重大问题，彭没有同吴商洽，就擅自决定和改变。他曾一再向人表示，对于自己长期处在副司长的地位十分不满。
    彭达对监察部所有与他意见不相同的领导干部，都加以攻击。他曾狂妄地诬蔑“监察部党组是纸老虎，一戳就破”，辱骂党组成员是“死官僚主义”，是“得过且过，苟且偷安”，是“当官、拿钱、画圈圈”。彭达为了抬高自己，在言谈中总是一方面把监察部的领导说成一无是处，说什么“现在是一级不如一级，即监察部不如监察局，监察局不如监察室，谁领导谁，值得考虑”，“监察部的领导软弱无力，能做事的人不多，部长助理不一定比司长强”，“司长出去检查工作，就是司长领导部长”，等等。另方面他又把自己说成是“常胜将军，无往不胜”，经常吹嘘自己在监察工作方面的所谓“丰功伟绩”，使别人觉得“监察部领导人都不行，唯有彭达行”。
    彭达十分厌恶老干部。他知道老干部是党的领导骨干，一般说来政治思想水平比较高，比较容易觉察或识破他的反党活动。因此，他总是恶意攻击老干部，说什么老干部都是些“万金油”、“白帽子”、“甩袖子队”、“吃老本，吃完了，就完了”；“老本就是资格和能讲两句马列主义”等等。他曾诬蔑工矿企业的负责干部，是“狗熊管理企业”。至于青年干部，彭达也只是喜爱那种善于依他的意图行事和替他吹嘘捧场的人；而对那些和他意见不合或向他的错误言行进行斗争的青年干部则任意训斥和打击。更恶劣的是，彭达为了实现他的个人野心，专门拉拢一些有政治历史问题的人，重用那些对他百依百顺的亲信作为他在工作中的“连手”。这些人和彭达一鼻孔出气，依靠彭达一手提携；彭达则依靠他们宣传和推行他的一套反党纲领。
    利用一切机会，宣传反党论点
    彭达经常利用到监察干部训练班讲课、参加各工业国家监察局的会议、出外检查工作以及向报纸刊物写稿等一切可以利用的机会，大肆鼓吹他那一套与党的方针完全相对立的监察工作的主张。他在天津工矿监察干部训练班讲话宣传垂直领导时，一方面把工矿企业的负责干部说得一文不值；另一方面又向学员们说：“老兄们，可大胆了，你们不要怕了。你们回去告诉厂长，以后我们不属你们管了。”“你们回去只管做，我彭达个儿大，出了问题，有我来担当。”这实质上是向监察干部贯输特权思想，煽动他们与企业党政领导闹对立。第五次全国监察工作会议以后，彭达为了偷天换日，歪曲五次会议精神，竟勾结研究室副主任右派分子陈达之召集了十几个企业监察室干部开会。彭达在会议总结时攻击过去的监察工作方法是“以官僚主义检查官僚主义”的方法，竭力吹嘘他的所谓“跟班检查”的方法，即纯技术性的检查方法。会后，彭达还与陈达之合谋，在“国家监察工作”这一刊物上组织文章，加以宣传推广。
    反对党的根本路线，攻击社会主义制度
    彭达还公然反对党的根本路线，诽谤和攻击党中央和国务院的某些负责同志，甚至妄想推翻社会主义制度。
    彭达一贯主张取消马列主义作为指导思想。他经常在监察干部中宣传“谁有业务能力，谁就能领导”、“不能靠政治吃饭”等反动言论。他污蔑党所一再强调的加强政治思想工作是“卖狗皮膏药”，并公开谩骂领导干部是：“光靠政治吃饭”、“离开业务、空谈政治”。他认为第六次全国监察工作会议的结论是“满篇政治，但没有政治”。他还反对监察干部学习马列主义。在他主办的三期工矿监察干部训练班中，除了第二学期了了草草地上了几次“第一个五年计划”的课程外，再没有上过政治课。尤其严重的是，当部务会议作出关于加强干训班的政治课的决定后，他仍坚不执行。彭达这一系列的言行，实质上是以强调学习业务为幌子，来取消马列主义的指导思想。他甚至公然向要求作党务工作的干部散布“党要取消的”谬论。
    彭达还十分厌恶和反对党的群众路线。他不但不提倡、不宣传党的群众路线；反而经常对它加以讽刺和诬蔑，说什么“走群众路线不能解决问题”等。他在监察工作中，从不依靠群众来进行工作，而是一味强调依靠个人的业务技术能力来解决问题。他不相信群众的智慧，认为监察通讯员反映的情况零零碎碎，不起作用，主张取消。
    彭达在工作中一贯破坏党的民主集中制，对上要求极端民主，对下实行个人专断。他公开宣传：“谁的意见正确，谁就是领导。”“如果领导上不采纳你的意见时，你可以在下边组织酝酿，造成群众舆论，迫使领导上采纳你的意见。”他还“鼓励”干部要“独立思考”，“不要盲从”，而且捏造事例说，他过去在老区工作时，有次中央下达一指示，讨论中，其他人都同意，唯有他提出不同意见。一月后，中央修改了这一指示，果然与他的意见一致。彭达对他自己所领导的工作，一贯是独断专行。他在领导第二司工作中，一直反对在司里实行集体领导，反对建立司务会议制度。当领导上向他指出应该贯彻集体领导的原则时，他公然反抗说：“什么卵集体领导，我才不理那一套。”
    彭达还反对党的第八次全国代表大会所作的“在工矿企业中实行党委领导下的厂长负责制”的决定，并认为实行这一决定，就是党委包办一切。
    彭达还恶意攻击肃反运动，反对在肃反运动中采取群众路线的作法。他否定监察部的肃反成绩，诬蔑监察部第二司的肃反是“人为地制造矛盾”。他还诬蔑监察部五人小组领导人是“过于执”，表示自己要当“况锺”。他经常打击肃反积极分子，甚至辱骂肃反积极分子“是没有头脑的”。彭达为了拉拢第二司当时的一位肃反的对象，竟然向他泄露党的机密，并在大鸣大放期间指使他在肃反问题上向党进攻。
    彭达反对党的根本路线和取消马列主义指导思想的根本目的是为了推翻社会主义制度。5月18日彭达在第二司全体干部整风学习讨论会上的发言中，直接攻击社会主义制度，反对无产阶级专政。他首先说：“不要迷信社会主义”。接着又说：“社会主义制度一切都好，这只是宣传”。“社会主义制度有两面性，有好的一面，也有坏的一面。”“无产阶级专政带来官僚主义。”
    彭达原来是一个混入党内的阶级异己分子
    彭达为什么一贯地干着反党反人民的罪恶活动呢？只要我们仔细地查看一下他的历史，也就真相大白了。早在1936年至1938年间，彭达即先后担任过绥远省防共自卫团的政训员、大队督导员、国民兵团第四团政训主任等职。这样一个专门从事反共政治工作的能手，却于1938年8月混入革命队伍，并于同年9月混进了共产党。1941年彭达在安北县工作时曾向敌人自首变节，使当地党的组织遭到破坏，后来他到了延安，曾隐瞒了这段罪恶的历史，混入了共产党。从此，他就长期隐藏在革命队伍里，暗地里干着不可告人的勾当。
    在声势浩大的反右派斗争开始以后，监察部和中央各工业国家监察局的许多同志，逐渐擦亮了眼睛，提高了认识，因此，纷纷揭发了彭达的许多反党言行。7月份以来，监察部的干部在党组领导下，向这个党内的右派分子发起了围攻。但是，在大量的罪证面前，彭达仍在继续顽抗。彭达究竟何去何从，要靠他自己去选择。
