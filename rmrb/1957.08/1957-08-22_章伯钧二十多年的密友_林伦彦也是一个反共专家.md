Zhang Bojun's Close Friend of Over Twenty Years
　　Lin Lunyan is Also an Anti-Communist Expert

　　This newspaper reports that rightist Lin Lunyan, professor of the History Department of South China Normal College and chairman of the China Democratic League branch, has been exposed under the criticism and denunciation of professors, staff, and students of the entire college as a bourgeois political ambitious person in a professor's cloak.

　　Lin Lunyan said triumphantly that he and Zhang Bojun were old friends of over twenty years, people who "sat side-by-side" with Zhang Bojun. He believed that the Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution must be led by the national bourgeoisie, and that the Chinese Communist Party was merely a peasant army and could only serve as a reserve force. Before the People's Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River in 1949, he and Zhang Bojun, Zeng Zhaolun, and others discussed the program of the British Labour Party with relish, designing a political blueprint: to establish a state of bourgeois dictatorship. When the CCP issued the "May 1st" call in 1948, various democratic parties declared their support. At that time, Lin Lunyan was a member of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK). When drafting the RCCK's opinion paper, Zhang Wen, Deng Chumin, and others strived to add a preface to the opinion paper clarifying their support for the leadership of the Communist Party and the New Democracy, but Lin Lunyan opposed doing so. In order to accumulate personal political capital, he also privately developed "special group" members throughout Nanjing, Shanghai, Hankou, and Guangdong, even bringing Trotskyites, secret agents, and reactionary military officers into it. However, this "special group" list of his was rejected at a meeting of the RCCK Central Committee in Beijing, and he himself was severely criticized and removed from the RCCK Central Committee member list. His original expectation of becoming a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) also fell through. In the early days of liberation, he adopted the posture of a "disappointed politician" and "went south in a huff," saying, "Having seen the great ocean, other waters are hard to attract; if this road doesn't work, another will; if politics doesn't work, teaching still has capital."

　　During his so-called "teaching" period, he had been constantly slandering the leadership of the Communist Party, saying that after liberation, "intellectuals were scapegoats" and "the three harms of Marxism-Leninism suffocated us." He also did his best to slander the various political movements led by the Party.

　　People have given powerful exposures and refutations to Lin Lunyan's reactionary words and deeds. Zeng Jinyi, associate professor of South China Normal College, solemnly pointed out: Lin Lunyan has not yet surrendered. He warned Lin Lunyan: "Do not take the tolerance of the people as something to be deceived; if you persist in your error, you will be permanently cut off from the people!"

    章伯钧二十多年的密友
　　林伦彦也是一个反共专家
    本报讯　右派分子华南师范学院历史系教授、民盟支部主任委员林伦彦，在全院教授、职员、学生的批判揭发下，已暴露出他原来是一个披着教授外衣的资产阶级政治野心家。
    林伦彦得意地说他和章伯钧是二十多年的老朋友，是和章伯钧“排排坐”的人物。他认为中国资产阶级民主革命必须由民族资产阶级领导，中国共产党不过是农民军，只能做后备力量。1949年解放大军渡江前夕，他就和章伯钧、曾昭抡等津津有味地研究英国工党的纲领，设计一幅政治蓝图：建立一个资产阶级专政的国家。1948年中共发布“五一”号召时，各民主党派纷纷声明拥护。那时，林伦彦是民革中央委员，起草民革的意见书时，张文、邓初民等力争要在意见书上加上阐明拥护共产党领导、拥护新民主主义的序言，但林伦彦却反对这样做。为了积蓄个人政治资本，那时他还私自发展“特别小组”成员遍及南京、上海、汉口、广东，连托派、特务、反动军官也拉进去了。但是他这张“特别小组”的名单，被民革中央在北京开会时否决了，他自己也受到了严厉的批判，并把他从民革中央委员中除名，他原预料要当上的政协会国委员也落空了。解放初期，他就以一个“失意政客”的姿态“一怒南下”，说什么“曾经沧海难为水，此路不通彼路通，政治不行，教书还有本钱。”
    在他的所谓“教书”的时期内，他一直在诋毁共产党的领导。说什么解放后“知识分子是待罪的羔羊”“三害的马列主义压得我们透不过气来。对党所领导的历次政治运动，他也极尽污蔑之能事。
    对于林伦彦的反动言行，人们予以有力的揭发和驳斥。华南师范学院副教授曾近义严正地指出：林伦彦直到现在还没有缴械投降。他警告林伦彦说：“切不可把人民的宽容，视为可欺，如果执迷不悟，那便将永绝于人民了！”
