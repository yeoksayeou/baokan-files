Regulations of the State Council on prohibiting state-planned purchase (monopoly purchase) and unified purchase of agricultural products and other materials from entering the free market (Passed at the 56th meeting of the State Council's plenary session on August 9, 1957).

Since 1953, the government has successively designated grain, oil crops, and cotton as state-planned purchase (monopoly purchase) materials, implemented by the state. Only after the state-planned purchase tasks are completed are farmers allowed to sell their retained grain, oil crops, and cotton in the state grain market and other markets led by the state. For flue-cured tobacco, jute, ramie, hemp, sugarcane, silkworm cocoons, tea, live pigs, wool, cowhide, native sugar, native paper, tung oil, scrap copper, scrap tin, scrap lead, important timber from concentrated production areas, certain Chinese medicinal materials, apples and oranges for export, and aquatic products for export and large cities in certain fish-producing areas, the government lists them as materials for state unified purchase, which are uniformly purchased by state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives entrusted by the state. The method of unified purchase is that the state stipulates the proportion to be purchased by the state (for example, a certain percentage of local production). After the state purchase quantity is completed, the remaining part is allowed to be sold on the market. The above two methods, namely, planned purchase and unified purchase, are intended to ensure the unified and rational distribution of these important agricultural products and other materials nationwide.

After the implementation of planned purchase and unified purchase of important agricultural products and other materials, the exchange of important materials between urban and rural areas is smooth; however, there have also been instances where a portion of small local products in rural areas were not purchased, and some handicrafts in cities were not transported to rural areas for sale, resulting in a phenomenon of "smooth flow for large items, but blockage for small items" in urban and rural exchanges. In order to overcome this hindrance in urban and rural exchanges, the government decided in the second half of 1956 to open the free market for small local products in rural areas. After the opening of the free market for small local products in rural areas, the small local products that were previously unsalable were sold smoothly, stimulating farmers' production in this area, which is beneficial to the people in both urban and rural areas. However, because there were no pre-determined regulations on which agricultural products were allowed to enter the free market and which were not allowed to enter the free market before the opening of the rural free market, many agricultural products subject to planned purchase entered the free market when the rural free market was opened. Moreover, because the state only stipulated the purchase of a certain proportion of agricultural products and other materials under unified purchase, and the remaining part was allowed to be sold on the market, many agricultural products and other materials under unified purchase also entered the free market without restriction even before the state purchase tasks were completed. This hindered the state's planned purchase and unified purchase of important agricultural products and other materials, and hindered the unified and rational distribution of these agricultural products and other materials. This is detrimental to national construction and also detrimental to farmers.

In order to effectively implement the policy of planned purchase and unified purchase of important agricultural products and other materials, the State Council now makes the following provisions on the issue of important agricultural products and other materials entering the free market:

1.  All agricultural products subject to state-planned purchase, such as grain, oil crops, and cotton, shall not be opened to the free market and shall be entirely subject to state-planned purchase. After the state-planned purchase tasks are completed, if farmers want to sell the portion they retain for their own use, they are not allowed to sell it on the market and must sell it to state purchasing stores. Shops and peddlers not entrusted by the state to purchase are not allowed to purchase.

If certain provinces and regions believe that they can open a grain market under state leadership because the local grain supply and demand situation is relatively relaxed, they may open a local grain market under state leadership with the approval of the provincial people's committee.

Wherever it is decided to abolish the state grain market, the local grain department shall assist the masses as much as possible in solving difficulties in adjusting grain varieties.

2.  The following agricultural products and other materials are designated as materials for state unified purchase: flue-cured tobacco, jute, ramie, hemp, sugarcane, silkworm cocoons (including native silk), tea, live pigs, wool (including cashmere), cowhide and other important leather, native sugar, native paper, tung oil, nan bamboo, palm fiber, raw lacquer, walnuts, almonds, black melon seeds, white melon seeds, chestnuts, important timber from concentrated production areas, thirty-eight important Chinese medicinal materials (specific varieties to be notified separately by the Ministry of Health), apples and oranges supplied for export, aquatic products supplied for export and large cities in certain fish-producing areas, scrap copper, scrap tin, scrap lead, and scrap steel. These unified purchase materials shall be uniformly purchased by state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives entrusted by the state. Shops and peddlers not entrusted by the state are not allowed to purchase. If farmers want to sell the portion they retain for their own use, they are not allowed to sell it on the market and must sell it to the purchasing stores entrusted by the state, and these stores must be responsible for purchasing it.

Raw materials needed by handicraft cooperatives shall be supplied by relevant departments according to the plan, or purchased by the handicraft cooperatives themselves at state prices within a designated area and limited quantity by the provincial people's committee.

3.  Materials that do not belong to the above two categories of planned purchase and unified purchase, such as: chickens, ducks, geese, fresh eggs, condiments, aquatic products from scattered production areas, dried and fresh fruits from non-concentrated production areas, Chinese medicinal materials that are not subject to unified purchase, etc., shall still be open to the free market under state leadership.

If the supply of certain commodities mentioned above is tight in the local area, the provincial people's committee may order them to be designated as materials for local unified purchase and handled according to the provisions for unified purchase materials.

For commodities allowed to enter the free market under state leadership, state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives must also operate a certain proportion according to the needs. The local people's committee shall implement necessary management of the free market under state leadership. All commodities not allowed to enter the free market shall not be bought or sold in the free market. For enterprises and individuals who violate this regulation, their commodities shall generally be purchased at state prices, and in serious cases, they shall be sent to the people's court for handling.

4.  For the two categories of materials, planned purchase and unified purchase, stipulated by the state, the state only entrusts certain state-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives to carry out the purchase tasks. Other enterprises, institutions, and organizations not designated by the state to undertake the purchase tasks are not allowed to carry out the purchase. They are not allowed to send people to rural areas to purchase, nor are they allowed to purchase in cities privately transported planned purchase and unified purchase materials brought into the city. For enterprises, institutions, and organizations that violate this regulation, the local people's committee shall give strict punishment.

### 国家计划收购和统一收购的农产品及其他物资  国务院规定不准进入自由市场

    国家计划收购和统一收购的农产品及其他物资
    国务院规定不准进入自由市场
    新华社讯  国务院关于由国家计划收购（统购）和统一收购的农产品和其他物资不准进入自由市场的规定（1957年8月9日国务院全体会议第五十六次会议通过）。
    1953年以来，政府陆续规定粮食、油料、棉花为国家计划收购（统购）物资，由国家实行计划收购。计划收购任务完成以后，才允许农民把自己留用的粮食、油料、棉花在国家粮食市场和国家领导的其他市场上出卖。对于烤烟、黄洋麻、苎麻、大麻、甘蔗、家蚕茧、茶叶、生猪、羊毛、牛皮、土糖、土纸、桐油、废铜、废锡、废铅、集中产区的重要木材、若干种中药材、供应出口的苹果、柑桔、若干产鱼区供应出口和大城市的水产品等等，政府列为国家统一收购的物资，即由国家委托国营商业和供销合作社统一收购。统一收购的办法是国家规定由国家收购的比例（例如收购当地产量的百分之几十）。国家收购数量完成以后，其余部分允许在市场上出售。上述两种办法，即计划收购和统一收购的办法，都是为了保证这些重要农产品和其他物资在全国范围内得到统一合理的分配。
    实行重要农产品和其他物资的计划收购和统一收购以后，城乡重要物资的交流是畅通的；但是也出现过农村中一部分小土产无人收购，城市的一部分手工业品无人贩运下乡，因而发生城乡交流中“大通小塞”的现象。为了克服这种城乡交流中的阻滞现象，1956年下半年政府决定对农村小土产开放自由市场。农村小土产自由市场开放以后，过去无人收购和滞销的小土产都得到了畅销，刺激了农民在这一方面的生产，这是有利于城乡人民的。但是，因为在开放农村自由市场以前，没有预先规定那些农产品允许进入自由市场，那些农产品不准进入自由市场，因此，在开放农村自由市场的时候，许多属于计划收购的农产品进入了自由市场。又因为统一收购的农产品和其他物资，国家只规定收购一定的比例，其余部分允许在市场上出售，因此许多属于统一收购的农产品和其他物资也在国家收购任务完成以前，即已无限制地进入了自由市场。这样就妨碍了国家对于重要农产品和其他物资的计划收购和统一收购，妨碍了对于这些农产品和其他物资的统一合理的分配。这是不利于国家建设，也不利于农民的。
    为了切实执行重要农产品和其他物资的计划收购和统一收购的方针，国务院对于重要农产品和其他物资进入自由市场问题，现作如下规定：
    一、凡属国家规定计划收购的农产品，如粮食、油料、棉花，一律不开放自由市场，全部由国家计划收购。国家计划收购任务完成以后，农民自己留用的部分，如果要出卖的时候，不准在市场上出售，必须卖给国家的收购商店。不是国家委托收购的商店和商贩，一律不准收购。
    如果某些省区由于当地粮食供求情况比较缓和，认为可以开放国家领导下的粮食市场的时候，经过省人民委员会的批准，可以开放当地国家领导下的粮食市场。
    凡是决定取消国家粮食市场的地方，当地粮食部门应当尽可能帮助群众解决粮食品种调剂方面的困难。
    二、规定下列各种农产品和其他物资属于国家统一收购的物资。烤烟、黄洋麻、苎麻、大麻、甘蔗、家蚕茧（包括土丝）、茶叶、生猪、羊毛（包括羊绒）、牛皮及其他重要皮张、土糖、土纸、桐油、楠竹、棕片、生漆、核桃仁、杏仁、黑瓜子、白瓜子、栗子、集中产区的重要木材、三十八种重要中药材
  （具体品种，另由卫生部通知）、供应出口的苹果和柑桔、若干产鱼区供应出口和大城市的水产品、废铜、废锡、废铅、废钢。这些统一收购的物资都由国家委托国营商业和供销合作社统一收购。不是国家委托的商店和商贩，一律不准收购。农民自己留用部分如果要出卖的时候，不准在市场上出售，必须卖给国家委托的收购商店，这些商店必须负责收购。
    对于手工业合作社需要的原料，由有关部门按计划供应，或者由省人民委员会指定地区、限定数量、按照国家牌价由手工业合作社自行收购。
    三、不属于以上计划收购和统一收购两类的物资，如：鸡、鸭、鹅、鲜蛋、调味品、分散产区的水产品、非集中产区的干果和鲜果、不属于统一收购的中药材等等，仍然开放国家领导的自由市场。
    如果上述商品中的某些商品，在当地供应紧张的时候，省人民委员会可以命令规定为当地统一收购的物资，按照统一收购物资的规定办理。
    凡属允许进入国家领导的自由市场的商品，国营商业和供销合作社也必须根据需要情况，经营一定的比重。当地人民委员会对于国家领导的自由市场应当实行必要的管理。凡属不准进入自由市场的商品，一律不准在自由市场买卖。对于违反这一规定的企业和个人，一般地将其商品按国家牌价予以收购，情节严重的，送人民法院处理。
    四、对于国家规定计划收购和统一收购的两类物资，国家只委托一定的国营商业部门和供销合作社执行收购任务。其他不是由国家指定担任收购任务的企业、机关和团体，都不准进行收购。既不准派人到农村去收购，也不准在城市中收购私人贩运进城的计划收购和统一收购的物资。对于违反这一规定的企业机关和团体，当地人民委员会应当给以严格的处分。
