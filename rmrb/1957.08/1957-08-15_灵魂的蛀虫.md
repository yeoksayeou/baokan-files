The Soul's Woodworm
Cao Yu

Anyone would be shocked: these past few years, Ding Ling has actually been engaging in anti-Party conspiratorial activities with Chen Qixia and others. After attending the enlarged meeting of the Party Group of the Writers Association, I realized that Ding Ling was not an upright, kind, and loyal-to-the-Party female writer. Contrary to the expectations of her acquaintances and readers, she is an insidious, cunning turncoat who has never been loyal to the Party.

"Insidious, cunning," even her accomplice Chen Qixia saw her this way. These people have been engaging in small-group activities for a long time, creating discord, undermining unity, and drawing in those who are backward and dissatisfied with the Party. They even colluded with the rightists of Wenhui Bao to expand their influence. They exaggerated their own roles, resisted the Party's leadership, and interpreted all matters of principle as base personal-interest disputes. In the end, they developed to the point where an individual stood above the Party, and even planned to openly withdraw from the Writers Association at this year's October literary representatives' conference, resolutely splitting from the Party.

So, the Ding Ling who wrote "The Sun Shines Over the Sanggan River" is this kind of person. The People's Daily exposed that after she was arrested by Kuomintang secret agents in 1933, she betrayed her principles and became a traitor to the Party, but she concealed this for a long time. I remember once, when I flew to Moscow with her, she talked about the past. She said that she was arrested and imprisoned in Nanjing, and one day someone came to see her. She recognized this person's face and immediately cursed: "You traitor! You still dare to come see me!" After hearing this, I respected her very much. I felt that a revolutionary should be like that. However, in reality, she was beautifying and embellishing herself, just as her accomplice said: "Ding Ling cherishes her feathers and wants all the beautiful feathers to be her own." But this is no longer a matter of feathers, but a matter of her soul.

She often says that she is a "coward," meaning that she cannot withstand trials because she is timid. And "women," as she said in her article "Thoughts on March 8th," "Women are not made of iron, they cannot resist all the temptations and silent pressures of society." As if to say that even betraying principles in the face of the enemy is forgivable. But when I think about how she could still dress herself up in front of people after betraying her principles, without feeling any guilt or blushing, I feel that such a person is indeed frightening. This is not a "coward," but a woman who is extremely bold and has a heart of stone.

Comrade Mao Dun said that Ding Ling has the shadow of Miss Shafei, and this is very true. Ding Ling is arrogant, complacent, and looks down on everyone. She wants everyone to revolve around her like stars around the moon, all credit goes to Ding Ling, and any mistakes are someone else's. She has only one huge "self" in her mind. But she failed the test at three major junctures. First, after being arrested in Nanjing, she betrayed the Party. Second, during the most difficult time of the War of Resistance Against Japan, she wrote anti-Party articles and published Wang Shiwei's "Wild Lily," viciously slandering the Party and the revolution. Today, the great juncture of socialism has arrived, but she appears before us as a conspirator in an anti-Party group. This is the path of destruction for a stubborn individualist.

"Stubborn individualist," Ding Ling herself admits. But why did she develop from merely being dissatisfied with the Party to engaging in small groups and preparing to openly break with the Writers Association led by the Party? This is just as Chen Qixia of the Ding-Chen anti-Party group said: "Anti-Party activities are like stealing. Once you steal a little, you want to steal more." That's how stubborn individualists are. Endless personal ambition and desire make them "steal" from the Party again and again, with each successful "steal" emboldening them and further fueling their personal desires. The Gao-Rao alliance and the Ding-Chen group are both examples.

Ding Ling attaches great importance to her own works. It's a common fault of old-fashioned literati to think that their own articles are good. But what are one or two books compared to the great achievements of the people? Anyone with eyes can see this clearly. But among us, there are still some writers who think they are amazing, arrogant, and conceited. They cannot be criticized by anyone, cannot be led by anyone, and consider themselves above the masses and the Party. After seeing the ugly anti-Party behavior of the Ding-Chen group exposed, they should wake up. It is said that when the literary and art circles in Yan'an criticized Xiao Jun, who wrote "Village in August," an old comrade said: "Writers often think that writing a book is their personal creation. They always forget that their books are only written with a pen, while the deeds of the people that they retell are written with a drop of blood and sweat." It is excessive to write a little and become arrogant, not taking the Party and the people seriously, and constantly bringing up "a book" as if that book can kill people. Sooner or later, such people will be despised by the masses and crushed by the wheels of history.

It is said that Ding Ling once placed a photo of Tolstoy and her own photo side by side at home, saying that these were two great writers. And her personal photo was also hung on the wall of the literary seminar she led. Of course, we welcome Ding Ling to one day become "today's Cao Xueqin" or "China's Tolstoy," but to dress oneself up like that too early shows that one is too lacking in humility, which is a bad habit of individualists.

"Glory belongs to the Party, all credit belongs to the Party." This is not just a slogan, but is proven by the revolutionary history written with the blood of countless martyrs. But stubborn individualists don't think that way, even though they may say so. They evaluate everything that represents the principles of the Party from a pair of "individualistic eyes." They completely oppose personal interests to the interests of the Party and see others as individualists like themselves. They see those who represent the interests of the Party and criticize them in principle as base as themselves. They think that those who oppose them are people who are fighting with them for power and profit. They curse others for engaging in sectarianism but cannot see that they themselves are dregs who violate the interests of the Party, are anti-Party, and are traitors.

At the enlarged meeting of the Party Group of the Writers Association, someone said: "Ding Ling and Chen Qixia are a fox and a wolf." They collude with each other, harboring anti-Party emotions, and acting furtively. Chen Qixia would only go to Ding Ling's house when Ding Ling's public servants were out studying. I suddenly remembered that Mei Zhi, Hu Feng's wife, once said: "One must be wary of public officials." I never thought that Ding Ling and the others would have the same mentality. Once a world-renowned Party member and writer harbors anti-Party emotions and betrays the Party, she will degenerate into being as insidious as Mei Zhi.

We unanimously believe that the struggle against the Ding-Chen group is of great educational significance for the national literary and art circles. It shows that any writer, no matter how talented, once they have corrupt bourgeois ideas and embark on the path of seeking power and domination and becoming a personal careerist, they will inevitably oppose the Party, betray the people, and head towards destruction.

We must never allow such an anti-Party group to stir up trouble in the literary and art circles, and we will never allow a second Ding Ling or Chen Qixia to appear. What we are fighting for now is not a small matter, but whether we want the leadership of the Party, whether we want a socialist literary and art line, and whether we want unity. Relaxing this struggle will allow the poisonous weeds of bourgeois individualism to breed in the literary and art circles. Once these poisonous weeds spread, they will surely tear today's literary and art circles apart and deviate from the Party's socialist literary and art path. This anti-Party group has always promoted personal worship, mutually praised each other, played double-dealing tactics towards the Party and the masses, sowed discord, and rejected the leadership of the Party. These people have become a small handful of short-sighted people who have lost their Party spirit. This group of "writers" are no longer "engineers of the soul," but "termites of the soul."

Exposing their conspiratorial activities is an enlightened measure by the Party. We must sweep away all anti-Party activities and thoughts in the literary and art circles, and we must destroy the positions of personal careerists, so that we can unite on a new, solid foundation and advance bravely without any worries, to develop the socialist literary and art cause.

    灵魂的蛀虫
    曹禺
    任何人都会震惊：这几年来丁玲原来一直和陈企霞等人进行反党的阴谋活动。参加作协党组的扩大会议以后，我才发现丁玲并非一个正直、善良、忠于党的女作家，而出乎她的相识和读者的意料之外，她是一个阴险、狡猾，一直对党不忠诚的变节者。
    “阴险、狡猾”，连她的同谋者陈企霞也这样看她。他们这些人长期以来进行小集团活动，制造不和，破坏团结，拉拢那些落后的、对党不满的人，甚至和文汇报右派分子们勾结一道，扩大他们的势力。他们夸大自己的作用，抗拒党对他们的领导，把一切原则性的斗争都解释成卑鄙的个人的利益纠纷。最后，发展到个人站在党的上面，居然准备在今年十月的文艺代表大会上公开退出作协，与党断然分裂。
    原来写“太阳照在桑乾河上”的丁玲是这样的一个人。人民日报揭露她在1933年被国民党特务抓去后，她变了节，成了党的叛徒，但她却长期隐瞒这件事情。记得有一次，我和她一道飞往莫斯科，在飞机上她谈起往日来。她说，在南京被捕入了狱，一天，有一个人来找她，她认清了这个人的面孔，就破口大骂：“你这个叛徒！你还来见我！”我听了以后非常敬重她，我觉得一个革命者是该如此的。然而事实上她在粉饰打扮自己，正如她的同谋者说：“丁玲很爱惜羽毛，希望美丽的羽毛都是自己的。”但这已不是羽毛的问题，而是她的灵魂的问题了。
    她好说自己是“胆小鬼”，意思是说，她经不起考验是因为胆小。而“女人们”正如她那篇文章“三八节有感”中讲的：“女人不是铁打的，他们抵抗不了社会一切的诱惑和无声的压迫。”仿佛说，即使在敌人面前变了节，也是可原谅的。但是我一想起她变节后还能在人面前那样装扮自己，一点也不感到理屈，也不曾红一下脸，便觉得，这样的人确实是叫人害怕的。这不是一个“胆小鬼”，是一个胆大包天、心如铁石的女人。
    茅盾同志说丁玲身上有莎菲女士的影子，这话真是对的。丁玲骄傲自满、目空一切，希望一切人都众星捧月地围着她，一切功劳归于丁玲，任何错误都是别人的，脑子里只有一个巨大的“自己”。但她在三个大关头上都没有经得起考验。第一，在南京被捕以后，她背叛了党。第二，在抗日战争最困难的时候，她写了反党的文章，并发表王实味的“野百合花”，对党和革命进行恶毒的诽谤。今天，社会主义的大关来到了，她却以反党集团的阴谋者的面目出现在我们面前。这是一个顽强的个人主义者走向毁灭的道路。
      “顽强的个人主义者”，丁玲自己也承认的。但是为何她从仅仅对党有不满情绪，发展到搞小集团，准备与党所领导的作协公开决裂呢？这正如丁陈反党集团的陈企霞所说：“反党像是偷东西，偷了一点点，就想偷得更多。”顽强的个人主义者便是这样。了无止境的个人野心和欲望使他对党“偷”了还要“偷”，水涨船高，“偷”成功一次，胆便更大，个人的欲望便更燃烧起来。高饶联盟和丁陈集团都是例证。
    丁玲是很重视她自己的著作的。文章是自己的好，这原是旧文人的通病。区区一两本书在人民的丰功伟绩前面究竟算得了什么，这是有眼睛的人都看得明白的。但在我们当中，却仍有一些搞写作的认为自己了不得，狂妄、自傲，任何人不能批评，任何人不能领导，自居群众之上，党之上，看见丁陈集团的丑恶的反党的行为被揭露以后，应该猛醒了。听说，在延安文艺界批评写“八月的乡村”的萧军的时候，有一位老同志讲：“作家写出一部书往往认为是他个人创造出来的。他总忘记，他的书仅仅是用笔写成的，而他所重述的人民的事迹，却是人民用一滴一滴的血和汗写成的。”写了一点点东西便狂妄自大，把党和人民都不放在眼里，动不动便提出他那“一本书”，以为他那一本书可以打死人，这真是过分估计自己的本领。这样的人早晚会被人民群众鄙弃，被历史的车轮辗成乌有。
    据说，丁玲在家里曾把托尔斯泰的相片和她自己的相片并摆在一起，说这是两个大作家。而她领导的文学讲习所的墙壁上也挂起她个人的相片。当然，我们欢迎丁玲有一天会成为“今天的曹雪芹”或“中国的托尔斯泰”，但过早地把自己那样装扮起来，就显出自己太不谦虚，是个人主义者的坏习性。
      “光荣归于党，一切功劳归于党”，这不是一句口头禅，而是经过千万先烈流血写成的革命历史证明的。但是顽强的个人主义者却不这样想，尽管他们嘴上也会这样说。他们把一切代表党的原则的斗争，都从一双“个人主义者的眼睛”来估量。他们把个人利益与党的利益完全对立起来，而且看别人也和他们一样都是个人主义者。他们把代表党的利益，对他们进行原则性批评的人，也看成和他们一样的卑劣。他们以为反对他们的人就是与他们争权夺利的人，他们咒骂别人闹宗派，而看不见自己正是违反党的利益的、反党、叛党的败类。
    在作协党组的扩大会议上，有人说：“丁玲和陈企霞是一条狐狸，一条狼。”他们互相勾结，抱着反党情绪，鬼鬼祟祟。陈企霞到丁玲家里都是等到丁玲的公务员出门学习的当口。我忽然想起，胡风的妻子梅志曾经说过：“对公家人不能不存戒心。”想不到丁玲他们也有了同样的心理。一个闻名世界的党员作家，一旦她有了反党情绪，背叛了党，她便会堕落到像梅志那样的阴险。
    我们一致认为，对丁陈集团的斗争对于全国文艺界是富有极大的教育意义的。它说明了，任何一个作家，不论他多么有才能，一旦有了腐朽的资产阶级思想，走上争权称霸、个人野心家的道路，他必然会反党，背叛人民，走向毁灭。
    我们绝不能允许这样一个反党集团在文艺界兴风作浪，也绝不允许有第二个丁玲、陈企霞出现。我们现在争的不是一件小事情，而是究竟要不要党的领导，要不要社会主义文艺路线，要不要团结的问题。放松了这个斗争，便会使文艺界滋生资产阶级个人主义的毒草，这种毒草一旦蔓生起来，定然会把今天的文艺界搞得四分五裂，离开党的社会主义文艺道路。这个反党集团一直提倡个人崇拜，互相吹捧，对党和群众都玩弄两面派的手法，挑拨离间，拒绝党的领导，这些人已成了一小撮鼠目寸光、失去了党性的人。这群“作家”早已不是“灵魂的工程师”，而是“灵魂的蛀虫”。
    揭露了他们的阴谋活动是党的英明措施。我们必须扫清一切文艺界的反党活动和思想，必须摧毁个人野心家的阵地，我们才能在新的、坚固的基础上团结起来，才能毫无后顾之忧，勇往直前地发展社会主义的文艺事业。
