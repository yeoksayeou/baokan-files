Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, August 20th: Egyptian newspapers on the 19th expressed support for Syria's current struggle against new imperialist conspiracies and for consolidating its independence.

　　The "Al-Ahram" published an editorial on August 19th saying that all Egyptians support Syria, which is currently going through a critical period in its history. The newspaper explained that after the recent American-orchestrated conspiracy was uncovered, the domestic situation in Syria remains tense. The reactionary forces that instigated this conspiracy have not been completely eliminated, and imperialism is still waiting for an opportunity to take hostile action.

　　"Al-Ahram" said: Syria is engaged in a struggle to safeguard Arab nationalism, a struggle against the Baghdad Pact, against the Eisenhower Doctrine, and against Israel and its allies, but this struggle is not just Syria's struggle alone, but a struggle to safeguard the dignity and future of all Arab countries.

　　"Al Shaab" pointed out, "Let the Syrian incident at least serve as an example and teach us: any hesitation, any attitude of not daring to strike and destroy the hotbed of rebellion, any tolerance of opportunists and those who hesitate will open the door for more conspiracies and rebellions, and will foster a spirit of failure and resignation, thereby creating an extremely serious danger to the independent policies of Arab countries."

　　"Al-Gomhouria" said: Mediation between the United States and the liberated Arab countries is unnecessary, because the current tension caused by American conspirators is not the responsibility of these Arab countries. The newspaper said this in commenting on a statement made by the Italian President, which stated that Dulles is currently asking him to carry out such mediation activities.

　　"Al-Gomhouria" also published an article written by Sadat, pointing out that Dulles wants to use the Italian President as a smokescreen in order to implement his insidious plans in the Middle East.

　　Xinhua News Agency, August 20th: According to TASS, Paris, August 19th: Many newspapers in Paris believe that the crushing of the anti-government conspiracy in Syria is a failure of American Middle East policy.

　　Right-wing newspapers, such as "Le Figaro" and "L'Aurore", do not hide their annoyance that the imperialist bloc's conspiracy to overthrow the Syrian government and drag Syria into an aggressive military bloc has been foiled.

　　French democratic newspapers believe that the exposure of the conspiracy and the measures taken by the current Syrian government are a contribution to safeguarding Syria's national independence.

　　"L'Humanité" questioned the American newspapers for fabricating facts to oppose Syria. It said: "Who believes that little Syria would threaten the security of the United States? Is it the Syrian fleet patrolling the Gulf of Mexico, or the US Sixth Fleet sailing in the Mediterranean? Is it the Damascus government sending agents to Montreal or Mexico to stir up anti-American incidents, or is it the Eisenhower government trying to turn Lebanon into an American territory?"

　　埃报支持叙利亚反帝斗争
　　揭露杜勒斯想利用意总统调解作为新阴谋的烟幕
    据新华社开罗20日电　埃及报纸19日表示支持叙利亚当前反对帝国主义新阴谋和巩固自己独立的斗争。
    “金字塔报”8月19日发表社论说：全体埃及人都支持目前正在度过自己历史上的危难时期的叙利亚。这家报纸解释说，在最近美国所策划的阴谋破获以后，叙利亚国内情况仍然紧张。策动这次阴谋的反动势力并没有完全肃清，帝国主义仍然在伺机采取敌对行动。
    “金字塔报”说：叙利亚正在进行维护阿拉伯民族主义的斗争，进行反对巴格达条约、反对艾森豪威尔主义、反对以色列和它的盟国的斗争，但是这种斗争并不是叙利亚一国的斗争，而是维护一切阿拉伯国家的尊严和前途的斗争。
      “人民报”指出，“让叙利亚事件至少成为一个例证，并且教导我们：任何犹豫不决，不能大胆打击和摧毁叛乱温床的态度，任何容忍机会主义分子和那些犹豫不决的人的态度将会给进行更多的阴谋和叛乱活动打开大门，并且会助长失败和听天由命的精神，从而为阿拉伯独立政策制造一个极为严重的危险”。
      “共和国报”说：在美国和解放了的阿拉伯国家之间进行调解是不必要的，因为目前由美国阴谋分子引起的紧张局势，其责任不在这些阿拉伯国家。这家报纸是在评论意大利总统所发表的声明时这样说的，这项声明说，杜勒斯目前正在要求他进行这种调解活动。
    “共和国报”同时刊登的萨达特所写的一篇文章指出，杜勒斯想利用意大利总统作为烟幕，以便在中东执行他的阴险计划。
    据新华社20日讯　据塔斯社巴黎19日讯：巴黎许多报纸都认为叙利亚粉碎反政府阴谋一事是美国的中东政策的失败。
    右派报纸，如“费加罗报”和“震旦报”，并不掩饰自己的懊恼情绪，它们懊恼帝国主义集团想推翻叙利亚政府并把叙利亚拖入侵略性军事集团的阴谋遭到了破产。
    法国民主报纸认为，阴谋败露和叙利亚现政府所采取的措施是对保障叙利亚的民族独立的贡献。
    “人道报”质问美国报纸为了反对叙利亚而捏造事实。它说：“谁相信小小的叙利亚会威胁美国的安全呢？是叙利亚舰队巡视墨西哥湾呢，还是美国第六舰队航行在地中海上呢？是大马士革政府派特务到蒙特利尔或者墨西哥去挑起反美事件呢，还是艾森豪威尔政府企图把黎巴嫩变成美国的领地呢？”
