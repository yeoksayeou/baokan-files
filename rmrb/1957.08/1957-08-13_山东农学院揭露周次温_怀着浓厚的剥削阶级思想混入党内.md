    Shandong Agricultural College Exposes Zhou Ciwen
    Infiltrated the Party with a Strong Exploiting Class Ideology
    (Our newspaper dispatch) Shandong Agricultural College exposed and criticized the anti-Party crimes of Zhou Ciwen, a traitor to the Party and an old-line rightist.
    Zhou Ciwen was the acting director of the Marxist-Leninist Teaching and Research Office of Shandong Agricultural College. He joined the Communist Party in 1936. During the "Great Blooming and Contending," he wantonly slandered the policies of the Communist Party, saying that the Three-Anti and Five-Anti movements "left the impression of utter darkness and bloodstains," and that "how many good people died because of the unified purchase and sale." He openly defamed the leading organs of the Communist Party, saying that the "mistakes" of the Three-Anti and Five-Anti movements "should be fully borne by the Party Central Committee." He also propagated among the masses, saying: "I joined the Party during the war. If it were now, after liberation, I would never join such a Communist Party." When Zhou Ciwen saw Chen Mingshu's fallacious argument in the newspaper that "the Party committee should withdraw from the school," he applauded it and shamelessly said: "I saw this point a long time ago."
    Zhou Ciwen came from a landlord class background and infiltrated the Communist Party with a strong exploiting class ideology. During the rent reduction and interest rate reduction, when the peasants just touched the landlord class's skin, Zhou Ciwen shouted that it was "leftist." During the land reform in 1950, he openly shielded the landlord family and his evil father, and was therefore disciplined by the Party.
    Currently, Zhou Ciwen has not yet bowed his head to admit his guilt. Shandong Agricultural College is preparing to further criticize his anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds.

### 山东农学院揭露周次温  怀着浓厚的剥削阶级思想混入党内

    山东农学院揭露周次温
    怀着浓厚的剥削阶级思想混入党内
    本报讯　山东农学院揭露和批判党的叛徒、老牌右派分子周次温的反党罪行。
    周次温是山东农学院马列主义教研室的代理主任，1936年参加共产党。在“大鸣大放”中，他肆意诬蔑共产党的政策，说三反和肃反运动“留下来的印象是暗无天日，血迹斑斑”，“统购统销不知死了多少好人”。他公然诽谤共产党的领导机关，说三反肃反的“错误”“党中央应负全责”。他还在群众中宣扬说：“我是战时入党的，假若是在解放后的现在，这样的共产党，我根本就不会参加。”周次温看到陈铭枢在报纸上发表的“党委应该退出学校”的谬论时，竟拍案叫绝，并无耻的说：“我早就看到这一点了。”
    周次温是地主阶级出身，怀着浓厚的剥削阶级思想混进了共产党的队伍。在减租减息中，农民刚刚触动了一下地主阶级的皮毛，周次温就大喊大叫“左了”。1950年土改时，他公然包庇地主家庭和恶霸父亲，因此受到党纪处分。
    现在，周次温还没有低头认罪，山东农学院准备对他的反党反社会主义的言行作进一步的批判。
