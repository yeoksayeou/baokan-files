Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, August 24th. The Kowloon Thirteen Villages Joint Support Bamboo Garden Villagers Association today issued an "Open Letter to the Public," demanding that the Hong Kong British authorities honor their promises and reasonably resolve the dispute, and calling on the public to provide support.

The "Open Letter to the Public" stated: Since the Hong Kong British authorities forcibly demolished shops and houses in Bamboo Garden Village on June 25th, two groups of villagers have directly suffered the tragedy of ruined homes and bankruptcy. Although representatives from the thirteen villages and people from all walks of life in Bamboo Garden Village have repeatedly negotiated with the relevant authorities, a reasonable solution has not yet been reached on the issue of compensation, and the resettlement of the forcibly evicted villagers has not been arranged.

The open letter said: Due to repeated negotiations by the farmers, the relevant authorities have recently made a compensation plan that is not satisfactory. For example, farmer Zhong You, who cultivated nearly five thousand square feet in Bamboo Garden Village, should be compensated at least three thousand five hundred and seventy-eight dollars and forty cents according to the compensation method once promised by the relevant authorities, but now the relevant authorities only intend to compensate four hundred and eighty-one dollars and forty-three cents. The letter listed some similar examples to accuse the injustice of the Hong Kong British authorities' measures, and asked: Farmers have lost their land, how will they make a living in the future? The homes built by the villagers through thrift and hard work, and the shops, schools, factories, and cultivated land painstakingly managed have been destroyed by the demolition, how will their wives and children live? The letter also said: At present, some of the displaced villagers are sick and have no money for medical treatment, and some are living on porridge, inevitably facing the danger of running out of food. They all demand that the authorities quickly allocate funds to provide rice for relief.

The "Open Letter to the Public" concluded: We are determined to uphold the opinions of the villagers of the thirteen villages, unite more closely, and continue to negotiate with the relevant authorities, striving for a reasonable solution based on reason and according to the facts. We demand that the Hong Kong British authorities honor their promises, provide compensation and resettlement, and strive for a reasonable resolution of the incident, and we will not stop until our goal is achieved.

　　英国当局应该实践诺言
    九龙十三乡联合支援竹园村民会发表“告社会人士书”
    新华社香港24日电　九龙十三乡联合支援竹园村民会今天发表“告社会人士书”，要求香港英国当局实践诺言，合理解决争端，并呼吁社会人士支援。
    “告社会人士书”说：自香港英国当局6月25日起强行拆迁了竹园村的商店、民房以后，已有两批乡民直接遭受到毁家破产的惨痛。虽经十三乡代表和竹园村各界乡民屡次向有关当局进行交涉，但对补偿问题，至今仍未获合理解决，被迫拆迁的乡民的善后也未有着落。
    公开信里说：由于农民三番五次的交涉，有关当局最近才作出了一个并未能令人满意的补偿办法。例如农民钟有，他在竹园村的耕种面积近五千平方英尺，即使按照有关当局曾经答应过的赔偿办法，全部起码也应赔偿三千五百七十八元四角，但现在有关当局只打算补回四百八十一元四角三分。信里列举了一些类似的例子来指责香港英当局措施的不公正之处，并且问道：农民已失去土地，今后将何以为生？乡民节衣缩食建设起来的家园，千辛万苦惨淡经营起来的商店、学校、工场、耕地已毁于拆迁，他们的妻儿将何以为活？信里又说：目前被拆迁的乡民有些人有病无钱医理，有些以粥度日，难免有断炊之虞。他们都要求当局迅速拨款发米救济。
      “告社会人士书”最后说：我们决心秉承十三乡乡民的意见，更加团结一致，继续向有关当局进行交涉，依情据理力争。要求香港英当局实践诺言，有赔偿、有安置，争取事件的合理解决，不达目的，誓不休止。
