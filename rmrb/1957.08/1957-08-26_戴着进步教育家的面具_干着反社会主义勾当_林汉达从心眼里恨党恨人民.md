Wearing the Mask of a Progressive Educator, Engaging in Anti-Socialist Activities
Lin Han-da Hates the Party and the People from the Bottom of His Heart

    (Our dispatch) The Central Leadership of the China Association for Promoting Democracy (CAPD) continued to hold rectification meetings on the 20th, 21st, and 24th, exposing and criticizing Lin Han-da, Vice Chairman of CAPD and Vice Minister of Education, for his anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds.
    Ma Xulun, Chairman of CAPD, was unable to attend the meeting due to illness. His written statement was read by Secretary-General Yang Dongchun. In his statement, Ma Xulun pointed out that Lin Han-da is a bourgeois rightist. Lin Han-da's speech at the United Front Work Department's symposium was his anti-communist program.
    Lin Han-da made two self-criticisms at the meeting, admitting in his self-criticisms that he "is indeed a bourgeois rightist." In the face of the facts, Lin Han-da admitted that when he went to Shanghai for inspection in May last year, he "intended to visit Zhan Wenhu, a counter-revolutionary sentenced to imprisonment," and "forwarded letters written to him by prisoners undergoing reform through labor to Tan Tiwu, who was also inspecting in Shanghai at the same time." He said that the root of his anti-communism was "bourgeois ideology and work style." However, he did not make a thorough confession, and the people present at the meeting further exposed and criticized him.
    Ye Laishi cited specific facts to show that Lin Han-da was also actively opposing the leadership of the Party in the area of ​​language reform. Ye Laishi said: On May 21, when Zhang Bojun used the issue of language reform to slander the Communist Party at the United Front Work Department's symposium, someone stood up on the spot to refute Zhang Bojun's anti-communist remarks. Afterwards, Lin Han-da said: "Zhang Bojun's three points were correct." Ye Laishi also cited facts to show that Lin Han-da attempted to seize leadership of the Language Reform Committee.
    In this self-criticism, Lin Han-da said that he only had "resentment" towards socialism. Many people pointed out that it was not a question of "resentment", but of opposing socialism from the bottom of his heart. Liang Chunfu said: Lin Han-da fundamentally opposed the socialist system. Lin Han-da once said: "China has no experience in carrying out even capitalist economic construction, so what is it doing with socialism?" Xu Boxin also cited specific facts of Lin Han-da's attempts to obstruct the CAPD's implementation of serving socialism in many major policies, demonstrating that Lin Han-da was opposed to CAPD taking the socialist road. During the blooming and contending period, Lin Han-da did his best to support and protect the reactionary program, tactics, and line of the CAPD's Shanghai Caoyang Middle School branch, saying that their "enthusiasm for opposing bureaucracy is good, and attempted to promote their 'experience' at the CAPD plenary session." Lin Han-da advocated lighting fires everywhere. Zhou Jianren, Vice Chairman of CAPD, advocated that opinions to the Party should be based on facts, and Lin Han-da pointed at Zhou Jianren's nose and scolded, "It is precisely this cautious attitude of yours that has hindered the development of CAPD." On the issue of developing the organization, Lin Han-da was exactly the same as Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji. He believed that: "CAPD has a small foundation," and its past development was "not excessive". It should "carry out large-scale development regardless of subjective and objective conditions" and develop the CAPD into a large party to "compete with" the Communist Party. Xu Boxin said: Obviously, Lin Han-da wanted to drag CAPD from the socialist road to the capitalist road.
    Feng Binfu pointed out that Lin Han-da's reactionary words and deeds were not accidental. As soon as Lin Han-da arrived in the Northeast Liberated Area, he shamelessly treated the Communist Party as a tool to seek personal gain and rights for himself. When his personal desires were not satisfied, he stood in opposition to the Communist Party and opposed the Communist Party. When the local Communist Party newspaper refused to publish his specious educational theories, he even slandered the Party newspaper as a "dung newspaper."
    Lei Jieqiong revealed that Lin Han-da also slandered the theories of Marxism-Leninism. He fabricated rumors, saying that "Marx once debated with Feuerbach, and Marx lost," he said: "Now Marx is held up to the sky, and it is said that Marxism is the truth. This is a case of 'the winner is king, the loser is a bandit'."
    Gui Wenhua, a literacy teacher from the Dongjiao District of Beijing, and Zhao Dehua, a teacher from the Qianmen District Cadre Spare-time School, refuted Lin Han-da's absurd remarks that "part-time teachers are second-class citizens" and that "it is better to feed dogs than literacy teachers" based on their personal experiences.
    Dong Chuncai, Zhang Mingyang, and others also spoke at the meeting.

### 戴着进步教育家的面具　干着反社会主义勾当　林汉达从心眼里恨党恨人民

    戴着进步教育家的面具　干着反社会主义勾当
　　林汉达从心眼里恨党恨人民
    本报讯　中国民主促进会中央领导同志整风座谈会在20、21、24日继续举行，揭发和批判民进副主席、教育部副部长林汉达的反党、反社会主义的言行。
    民进主席马叙伦因病未能出席会议，由秘书长杨东莼宣读了他的书面发言，在发言中，马叙伦指出林汉达是个资产阶级右派分子。林汉达在统战部座谈会上的发言，是他的反共纲领。
    林汉达在会上先后作了二次检讨，在检讨中他承认自己“确实是一个资产阶级右派分子”。在事实面前，林汉达承认去年5月到上海视察时，曾“打算去探望被判处徒刑的反革命分子詹文浒”，“把劳改犯人写给他的信，转给了同时在上海视察的谭惕吾”。他说他的反共根源是“资产阶级思想意识和工作作风。”但他不作彻底交代，到会的人对他作了进一步的揭发和批判。
    叶籁士举出具体事实，说明林汉达在文字改革问题方面，也是积极反对党的领导的。叶籁士说：5月21日，章伯钧在中央统战部座谈会上借文字改革问题大肆污蔑共产党的时候，当场有人起来驳斥章伯钧这种反共言论。事后林汉达却说：“章伯钧的三点意见是对的”。叶籁士又举出事实说明林汉达企图夺取文字改革委员会的领导权。
    林汉达在这次检讨中说他对社会主义只是“有抵触情绪。”许多人指出他不是“抵触情绪”的问题，而是从心底里反对社会主义。梁纯夫说：林汉达是根本反对社会主义制度的。林汉达曾说：“中国连搞资本主义的经济建设都没有经验，还搞什么社会主义？”徐伯昕也举出林汉达在许多重大方针、政策问题上，总是企图阻碍民进贯彻为社会主义服务的具体事实，说明林汉达是反对民进走社会主义道路的。林汉达在鸣、放期间，竭力支持、保护民进上海曹杨中学支部的一套反动纲领、策略、路线，说他们“反官僚主义的积极性是好的，并企图将他们的‘经验’在民进全会推广”。林汉达主张到处点火，民进副主席周建人主张对党提意见要实事求是，林汉达便指着周建人的鼻子骂道：“就是你这种谨小慎微的态度，阻碍了民进的发展。”在发展组织问题上，林汉达同章伯钧、罗隆基是完全一样的，他认为：“民进底子小”，过去发展的还“不滥”，应该“不顾主客观条件进行大发展”，把民进发展成一个大党派和共产党“分庭抗礼”。徐伯昕说：显然，林汉达要把民进从社会主义道路上，拉到资本主义的道路上去。
    冯宾符指出，林汉达的反动言行不是偶然的。林汉达一到东北解放区，就无耻地将共产党当成可以为他个人谋取利益和权利的工具，当他的个人私欲得不到满足时，就和共产党对立起来，反对共产党。当地共产党报纸拒绝发表他的似是而非的教育理论时，他竟污蔑党报是“粪报”。
    雷洁琼揭露林汉达还污蔑马克思、列宁主义的学说。他造谣说“马克思曾经同费尔巴哈辩论，马克思输了”，他说：“现在把马克思捧到天上，说马克思主义是真理，这是胜者为王，败者为贼。”
    北京市东郊区扫盲教师桂文华、前门区干部业余学校教员赵德华，分别就自己的亲身经历驳斥了林汉达所说的“业余教师低人二等”，“有饭不给扫盲教师吃，宁可给狗吃”的荒谬言论。
    在会上发言的还有董纯才、张明养等。
