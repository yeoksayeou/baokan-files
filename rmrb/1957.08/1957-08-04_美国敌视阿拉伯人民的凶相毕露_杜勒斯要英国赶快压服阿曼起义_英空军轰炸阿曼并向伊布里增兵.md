Xinhua News Agency, London, August 3rd: According to British newspapers, when Dulles secretly discussed the Oman incident with Macmillan and Lloyd on the 1st, he indicated that the United States basically supported Britain's actions but wanted a quick resolution. In a television and radio program on the 2nd, Dulles evaded reporters' questions about whether the United States supported Britain's actions. He said it was "a local disturbance and we hope it will end as quickly as possible." This not only confirmed British news about secret Anglo-American negotiations on the Oman issue, but it also brought to mind another piece of news circulating here yesterday: that the United States and Britain had agreed to delineate boundaries in the Middle East.

The same Dulles, who had loudly proclaimed the defense of the "national independence" of Jordan during the Jordan incident, now supports Britain's policy of military suppression when insurgent tribes demand the restoration of their inherent rights. Thus, Dulles has once again exposed the true face of the Eisenhower Doctrine before the Arab people: an instrument for maintaining and strengthening imperialism in the Middle East.

Xinhua News Agency, August 3rd: Bahrain News: British Air Force bombers bombed areas controlled by Omani insurgents on the 2nd.

A British official spokesman in Bahrain said on the 2nd that Royal Air Force "Shackleton" bombers and "Venom" and "Meteor" jet fighters attacked the forts of Firq and Nizwa on that day. The insurgents' barracks and huts at Firq, as well as the fortress at Nizwa, were destroyed.

This is the first time British officials have announced the use of bombers to bomb Omani insurgents; previously, Britain had only announced jet fighter attacks.

According to Agence France-Presse, Britain is reinforcing Ibri. The report said that a detachment of Cameroonian Highlanders, consisting of eighty men, was transported from the Buraimi Oasis to Ibri on the 2nd by Royal Air Force transport planes. Another detachment is reinforcing Ibri by land. Ibri, about one hundred kilometers from Nizwa and Firq, is an important stronghold for British forces close to the areas controlled by Omani insurgents.

Cairo News: The Omani Imam's representative in Cairo, Harsai, accused British warships on the 2nd of blockading the Omani coast and kidnapping many Omanis returning home by ship after making a pilgrimage to Mecca.

Harsai said that large-scale kidnappings took place on the high seas off the Omani coastline.

### 美国敌视阿拉伯人民的凶相毕露  杜勒斯要英国赶快压服阿曼起义  英空军轰炸阿曼并向伊布里增兵

    美国敌视阿拉伯人民的凶相毕露
    杜勒斯要英国赶快压服阿曼起义
    英空军轰炸阿曼并向伊布里增兵
    本报伦敦3日电　据英国报纸报道，杜勒斯在1日与麦克米伦、劳埃德秘商阿曼事件时，表示美国基本上支持英国的行动，但要快点解决。在2日的电视和广播节目中，杜勒斯回避记者所提出美国是否支持英国的行动的问题。他说，这“是一个地方性的骚乱，我们希望它将尽可能快地结束。”这不但证实了英报关于英美秘密谈判阿曼问题的消息，它还令人想起了昨天这里流传的另一个消息：英美同意在中东划定界线。
    同一个杜勒斯，在约旦事件中曾大叫维护约旦的“民族独立”，而今天当起义的部落要求恢复固有的权利的时候，却支持英国的军事镇压政策。就这样，杜勒斯又一次在阿拉伯人民面前暴露了艾森豪威尔主义的真实面目：一个维护和加强中东的帝国主义的工具。
    据新华社3日讯　巴林消息：英国空军轰炸机2日轰炸了阿曼起义者控制的地区。
    在巴林的一个英国官方发言人2日说，皇家空军“沙克莱顿式”轰炸机、“毒液式”和“流星式”喷气战斗机在这一天袭击了菲尔克堡和尼兹瓦堡。菲尔克堡起义者部队的营棚和茅屋以及尼兹瓦的城堡被炸毁。
    这是英国官方第一次宣布使用轰炸机轰炸阿曼起义者，在这以前，英国一直只宣布使用喷气战斗机进行袭击。
    据法新社消息，英国正在向伊布里增兵。消息说，由八十人组成的一个喀麦隆高地人部队的分队已经在2日由皇家空军运输机从布赖米绿洲运往伊布里。另外一个分队正从陆路向伊布里增援。伊布里离开尼兹瓦和菲尔克堡约一百公里，是紧靠着阿曼起义者控制地区的英国军队的重要据点。
    另据开罗消息：阿曼教长驻开罗代表哈尔赛2日指责英国军舰封锁阿曼海岸并且绑架了许多到麦加朝觐后乘船回家的阿曼人。
    哈尔赛说，大规模绑架行动发生在阿曼海岸线以外的公海上。
