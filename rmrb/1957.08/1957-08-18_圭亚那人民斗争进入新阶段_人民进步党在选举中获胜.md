Combined reports from our newspaper: According to Xinhua News Agency reports: Progressive forces in British Guiana have achieved a major victory in the parliamentary elections. Despite the British-controlled Guiana government deploying its entire police force of 2,500 and obtaining assistance from the British army in an attempt to exert pressure on voters, the election results show that the left-wing People's Progressive Party, led by Dr. Cheddi Jagan, won nine of the fourteen elected seats in the Legislative Assembly. The Burnham faction, which split from the party, won three seats, while the remaining two seats were won by the United Democratic Party and the National Labour Front respectively.

    In 1953, the British government dispatched armed forces to British Guiana, ousted the democratically elected government headed by Jagan, and imprisoned Jagan because he wanted to implement a progressive program.

    According to the constitution formulated by Britain for British Guiana, the British Governor has the right to appoint eleven additional members to the Legislative Assembly. In addition, three members are British officials, and the Governor has the final say in the composition of the Legislative Assembly. London newspapers predict that because Jagan won an overwhelming majority in the election, Governor Rennison may fully utilize his power to obstruct Jagan's left-wing party from governing.

    Cheddi Jagan visited the British Governor on August 16 to discuss the formation of a new government. The day before, when answering questions from reporters, Jagan said that even if Guyana gained complete independence, it would still have to remain within the British Commonwealth. He also said that he hoped to obtain British financial assistance to implement social and economic development plans.

    Guyana is located on the Atlantic coast of northern South America and has a population of approximately 500,000. It has been under British colonial rule since 1814. The People's Progressive Party, established in 1950, is a political party representing the interests of the people of British Guiana. Under the leadership of Cheddi Jagan, it has been relentlessly fighting for the people of British Guiana to obtain democracy, independence, and eliminate the exploitation of monopoly capital.

    圭亚那人民斗争进入新阶段
    人民进步党在选举中获胜
    本报综合报道  据新华社讯：英属圭亚那的进步力量在议会选举中获得了重大胜利。尽管英国控制的圭亚那政府出动了它的全部警察二千五百人，并且还取得了英军的帮助，企图对选民施加压力，但是选举结果表明，契迪·贾根博士所领导的左翼的人民进步党在立法议会十四个民选席位中赢得了九席，从这个党分裂出去的伯纳姆派获得了三席，其余二席分别为联合民主党和全国劳工阵线所得。
    1953年，英国政府出动了武装部队在英属圭亚那驱逐了以贾根为首的民选政府，并且囚禁了贾根，因为他要执行进步的施政纲领。
    按照英国为英属圭亚那制订的宪法，英国总督有权在立法议会里再指定十一名议员，另外还有三个议员由英国官员充任，同时总督在立法议会的组成上有最后决定权。伦敦报纸预料，由于贾根在选举中获得压倒多数，莱尼逊总督可能充分利用他的权力，来阻挠贾根的左翼政党执政。
    契迪·贾根8月16日拜访了英国总督，同他讨论了关于组织新政府的问题。在这前一天，贾根在答复记者的问题时曾说，圭亚那即使获得完全独立，也还必须继续留在英联邦之内。他还说，他希望获得英国的财政援助来执行社会和经济发展计划。
    圭亚那位于南美洲北部大西洋岸边，人口约五十万。它从1814年以来，受到英国的殖民统治。1950年成立的人民进步党是一个代表英属圭亚那人民利益的政党。它在契迪·贾根的领导下，为争取英属圭亚那人民获得民主、独立和消除垄断资本剥削而不懈地进行斗争。
