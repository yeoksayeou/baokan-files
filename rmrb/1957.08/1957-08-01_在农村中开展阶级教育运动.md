Launching a Class Education Movement in Rural Areas
Cao Liqin, Acting Secretary of the CPC Tai'an Prefectural Committee

    Tai'an Prefecture in Shandong Province has basically completed the socialist transformation of agriculture. Although it has only been over half a year, the superiority of collectivization is very clear. The management level of agricultural production cooperatives has generally improved. Spring production proceeded smoothly, seedlings are growing well, and wheat harvesting was completed in a timely manner. It should be said that this is inseparable from the increased political consciousness of rural cadres and masses, especially from the change in the leadership style of rural cadres.

New Problems Under New Circumstances

    Since the launch of the nationwide rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, there have been different reactions in rural areas. In areas where political and ideological work has been done well, farmers have enthusiastically supported the Party's rectification campaign and expressed immense indignation at the anti-Party and anti-socialist statements of rightists. Troubles have decreased, and some agricultural cooperatives that were clamoring to disband or had already disbanded have been restored and consolidated. However, in some rural areas where political and ideological work is weak, varying degrees of ideological confusion have occurred. This is evident in the pre-distribution of wheat and the grain purchase work this year. For example, this year the wheat harvest is generally recognized as good, but a considerable number of agricultural cooperatives concealed their yields from the state, and some production teams reported lower yields each time. For instance, the Liaoyuan Agricultural Cooperative in Tai'an County took the lead in falsely reporting reduced production. After persuasion, education, and careful verification, this cooperative produced more than 90,000 jin more grain than last year. The Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative in Xintai County had eleven production teams that secretly made large scales to "conceal production." In Licheng County, 10% of agricultural cooperatives distributed all the newly harvested grain to their members. This practice of only considering the personal interests of members and disregarding the interests of the state directly affected the completion of the grain purchase task.

    On the other hand, due to insufficient publicity and education on upholding the legal system in rural areas, there have been instances of mutual beatings among the masses. While individual cadres have illegally beaten the masses, there have been more cases of the masses beating cadres. Some landlords, rich peasants, and controlled counter-revolutionaries have also taken the opportunity to engage in activities. For example, in Yuzhuang Village in Zhangqiu County, a convicted counter-revolutionary manipulated backward masses to beat cadres and intercept public grain, and organized women in the village to resist the government. Grassroots cadres are often not good at handling these problems, with both "leftist" and rightist tendencies. Some are passive and afraid of difficulties, and unilaterally accommodate the backward sentiments of the masses.

    The Tai'an Prefectural Committee analyzed the unhealthy thoughts in rural areas and concluded that there are two main reasons: First, Chairman Mao's report on the correct handling of contradictions among the people has not been publicized deeply and thoroughly among grassroots cadres and the masses. Some agricultural cooperatives have not publicized it at all, but have heard some one-sided or even erroneous "interpretations." Second, the reactionary statements of rightists have spread to rural areas, and they have not been criticized in a timely manner. This shows that ideological education in rural areas is very weak, and therefore capitalist spontaneous forces and anarchist sentiments have taken the opportunity to grow.

Four Aspects of Class Education

    Based on the instructions of the Central Committee and the Provincial Committee, and based on the specific situation reflected at the County Party Committee Deputy Secretary Conference, the Prefectural Committee deployed a socialist class education movement throughout the region in early July. Because the depth and breadth of class education varied from place to place, the specific content and methods were not exactly the same, but they generally included the following four aspects: (1) Summarize the great achievements of socialist transformation and production construction in the community over the past year or several years, and based on the annual production increase plan and three- to five-year construction plan, point out the bright prospects of socialism. (2) Publicize the significance and situation of the rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, and criticize the reactionary statements of rightists. (3) Explain clearly what are contradictions among the people and how to correctly handle these contradictions? (4) How to support the Communist Party and socialism with practical actions, run the cooperatives well, and strive for a good harvest this year.

    It is very necessary to repeatedly conduct education on the superiority of socialism based on the construction achievements of the country, the province, the county, and the community. Some people say that this is "the same old thing," but as long as it is based on facts, through the farmers' recollections, careful calculations, and pointing out the goals and prospects, it can greatly stimulate the enthusiasm of the masses.

    Farmers are relatively unfamiliar with the Party's rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, so it is necessary to talk more about it. Explain the instances of the Party rectifying and improving its work while carrying out the campaign; explain the facts that leading cadres participate in physical labor and share weal and woe with the masses. As for opposing rightists, we should focus on criticizing the reactionary nature of the rightists' thoughts of attempting to overthrow the Communist Party and take the capitalist road.

    Regarding contradictions among the people, the following four points should be emphasized in the publicity: (1) Explain that the nature of the contradiction between leaders and the masses is based on the fundamental unity of interests; explain the fundamental difference between the People's Government and the reactionary government; (2) Explain that the solution of contradictions among the people requires democratic methods, while also explaining that this is democracy under centralized guidance, and criticizing the anarchic and lawless behavior and the reactionary viewpoint of so-called "absolute democracy and freedom"; (3) Explain the relationship between contradictions among the people and class struggle, focusing on explaining that class struggle on the ideological front will exist for a considerable period of time; (4) Explain that the main contradiction in rural areas at present is that the speed of production growth cannot keep up with the needs of the people's lives. Generally, we can conduct education on the unification of individual interests and national interests around the relationship between grain production and distribution.

Obvious Results Achieved

    This propaganda movement, which is mainly focused on class education, is currently developing unevenly, but it is proceeding widely and deeply. Judging from the areas with better progress, the role of this movement is significant. Wherever class education has been carried out, the socialist atmosphere is thick; the poor and lower-middle peasants stand tall, some vacillating middle peasants have become firm again, and landlords, rich peasants, and controlled elements have lowered their heads.

    This political and ideological work has first improved the class consciousness and understanding of the vast number of cadres. The confidence and enthusiasm of grassroots cadres have greatly increased. Among the seventy-two community and team cadres in Fengtai Township, Tai'an County, half of them were passive in their work some time ago. After education, most of them, except for a very small number, have become active again. They said: If we don't do it, are we going to let the landlords and rich peasants do it?

    After receiving socialist education, the vast number of farmers have also raised their awareness, and the poor and middle peasants are in high spirits. A poor peasant in Yaozhuang Township, Tai'an said: "Some time ago, it seemed like we were bending over and listening to the rightists scolding our collectivization as bad, but now we can stand up straight!" Many members said indignantly after listening to the criticism of the rightists' reactionary statements: If anyone opposes the Communist Party, we will pick up our sickles and fight them!

    Class education has also promoted current tasks. Members of the Dengta Cooperative in Fengtai Township, Tai'an, put forward the slogan of "hoeing one more time than planned, fertilizing one more time, not leaving an inch of land uncultivated, and striving for 10% more grain"; the attendance rate of members has increased to 95%. In terms of distribution, many agricultural cooperatives have also initially overcome the one-sided view of disregarding national interests. For example, Pujiqu District of Zhangqiu County overfulfilled the grain purchase task. Tai'an County previously estimated that it could only complete the purchase task of 11 million jin of grain, but now it is not a big problem for the county to complete 15 million jin of grain.

    The socialist ideological education movement in the Tai'an area still needs to be further deepened, especially to absorb the vast number of farmers into this movement, so as to widely unfold a great debate on right and wrong among the masses.

    在农村中开展阶级教育运动
    中共泰安地委代理书记　曹礼琴
    山东泰安专区基本上完成农业的社会主义改造，虽然只有半年多的时间，但合作化的优越性，已看得非常明确。农业生产合作社的经营管理水平普遍提高了，春季生产进行顺利，小苗长得不错，麦收也及时地完成。应该说，这与农村干部和群众政治觉悟的提高，特别是和农村干部领导作风的转变分不开的。
    新情况下的新问题
    全国性的整风运动以及反右派斗争开展以来，在农村中，有着不同的反应。凡是政治思想工作做得较好的地方，农民都热烈拥护党的整风运动，对右派分子反党反社会主义的言行，表示了无比的愤慨，闹事减少了，一些嚷着散伙，或已经散伙的农业社，又重新恢复和巩固起来。但是，在一些政治思想工作薄弱的农村里，却发生了不同程度的思想混乱。这在小麦预分和征购工作中，看得很明显。如今年公认小麦收成较好，但有相当数量的农业社向国家隐瞒了产量，有的生产队上报产量，一次比一次少。像泰安县燎原农业社抢先虚报减产，经过说服教育和认真核实，这个社比去年增产粮食九万多斤；新泰县曙光农业社有十一个生产队为了“瞒产”，私制大秤。历城县有10％的农业社把新打的粮食全部分给社员。这种只顾社员个人利益，不顾国家利益的作法，直接影响了粮食征购任务的完成。
    另一方面，由于农村中维护法制的宣传教育工作做得不够，在群众中有互相殴打的现象，个别干部虽然违法打群众，但出现更多的是群众殴打干部。有些地主、富农和被管制的反革命分子也乘机活动。如章丘县于庄村就发生了被判刑的反革命分子操纵落后群众打干部、截公粮；并在本村组织妇女对抗政府。基层干部对这些问题多不善于处理，偏“左”，偏右的情况都有，有些人消极畏难，片面迁就群众的落后情绪。
    泰安地委对当前农村不健康的思想作了分析，认为主要原因有两个：一，毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的报告，在基层干部和群众中宣传不深不透，有些农业社根本未作宣传，但却听到了些片面的甚至是错误的“解释”。二，右派分子的反动言论流传到农村，没有及时进行批判。这都说明农村的思想教育工作十分薄弱，因而资本主义自发势力和无政府主义的情绪乘机滋长。
    阶级教育的四项内容
    地委根据中央和省委的指示，根据县委副书记会议上反映的具体情况，在7月上旬部署了在全区开展社会主义阶级教育的运动。由于各地进行阶级教育的深度和广度不同，所以具体的内容方法也不完全一致，但大体上是以下四项内容：（一）总结本社一年或几年来社会主义改造和生产建设的伟大成就，并根据当年增产计划和三、五年的建设规划，指出社会主义的光明远景。（二）宣传整风运动和反右派斗争的意义和形势，批判右派分子的反动言行。（三）讲清楚什么是人民内部矛盾，怎样正确处理这些矛盾？（四）如何以实际行动来拥护共产党、拥护社会主义，把合作社办好和争取今年丰收。
    以全国全省以及本县本社的建设成就，反复进行社会主义的优越性教育，是非常必要的。有人说，这是“老一套”，但只要实事求是，通过农民回忆、算细账，并指出奋斗目标和远景，就很能激发群众的积极性。
    农民对党的整风运动和反右派斗争比较生疏，因此需要多讲一些。要讲党边整风边改进工作的实例；讲领导干部参加体力劳动和群众同甘共苦的事实。至于反对右派分子，应该着重批判右派分子妄想推翻共产党，走资本主义老路的思想的反动性。
    关于人民内部矛盾，在宣传中应强调以下四点：（一）讲明领导和群众之间的矛盾性质是在根本利益一致的基础上产生的；说明人民政府和反动政府的根本区别；（二）讲明解决人民内部矛盾要用民主的方法，同时要讲明这是集中指导下的民主，批判无政府、无法纪的行为和所谓“绝对民主自由”的反动论点；（三）说明人民内部矛盾和阶级斗争的关系，着重讲清思想战线上的阶级斗争，要在相当长的时间内存在；（四）讲明农村当前主要矛盾是生产增长速度，赶不上人民生活需要的矛盾。一般可围绕粮食生产与分配的关系，进行个人利益要和国家利益统一起来的教育。
    已经收到明显效果
    这次以阶级教育为主的宣传运动，目前发展还不平衡，但都在广泛深入进行中。从进展较好的地区来看，这次运动的作用是显著的。只要那里进行了阶级教育，那里的社会主义气氛就浓厚起来；那里的贫农和下中农的腰就挺直了，部分发生动摇的中农又坚定起来，地主、富农和被管制分子又低了头。
    这次政治思想工作，首先提高了广大干部的阶级觉悟和认识水平。基层干部工作信心和积极性大大增加了。泰安县凤台乡七十二名社、队干部中，前些时候曾有一半人工作消极，经过教育后，除极少数人外，大部分人重新积极起来。他们说：我们不干，难道让地主、富农来干吗？
    广大农民在接受社会主义教育以后，觉悟也提高了，贫农和中农情绪振奋起来。泰安姚庄乡的一个贫农说：“前些日子好像曲着腰听右派分子骂咱们合作化不好，现在腰可直了！”许多社员听了批判右派分子的反动言论后，愤慨地说：谁要反对共产党，我们就拿起镰刀和他拚！
    阶级教育还推动了当前各项工作。泰安丰台乡灯塔社社员提出了“比原计划多锄一遍地，多施一次肥，不荒一分地，争取多打一成粮”的口号；社员出勤率增到95％。在分配方面，许多农业社也初步克服了不顾国家利益的片面观点。如章丘县普集区，超额完成了征购任务。泰安县前些时统计只能完成征购任务一千一百万斤粮食，现在全县完成一千五百万斤粮食也没多大问题了。
    泰安地区的社会主义思想教育运动，还有待进一步深入开展，特别是要把广大的农民吸收到这个运动中来，以便在群众中广泛地展开是非的大辩论。
