　　Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 20th: The Chiang Kai-shek clique's "U.S. Aid Utilization Committee" recently announced that in the past six years ending in June of this year, the United States has dumped over $456 million worth of goods on Taiwan. Of this, more than $360 million were general consumer goods. Goods that could be used for construction amounted to only more than $80 million, while the supply of so-called "technical assistance" was less than $6 million.
    Relying on the large-scale dumping of goods into Taiwan, the United States has controlled the raw material supply of many industrial sectors in Taiwan and manipulated Taiwan's commodity market.

　　美国向台湾倾销消费品
    新华社广州20日电　蒋介石集团“美援运用委员会”最近公布：在到今年6月为止的过去六年间，美国向台湾倾销的物资已达到四亿五千六百多万美元。其中有三亿六千多万元为一般消费品。能够供建设用的物资仅八千多万元，而所谓“技术援助”方面的供应，还不到六百万元。
    美国依靠大批向台湾倾销物资，控制了台湾许多工业行业的原料供应和操纵了台湾的商品市场。
