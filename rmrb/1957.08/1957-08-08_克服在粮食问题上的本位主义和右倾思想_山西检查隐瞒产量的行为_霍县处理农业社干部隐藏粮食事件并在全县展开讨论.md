    Overcome Localism and Right-leaning Thought in Grain Issues
    Shanxi Checks Hidden Production
    Huo County Handles Agricultural Cooperative Cadres Hiding Grain and Launches Discussion Throughout the County

    (Our Correspondent Shang Kai reports) A large-scale debate on grain issues will be launched in the vast rural areas of Shanxi Province.

    In many agricultural production cooperatives in Shanxi Province, influenced by capitalist ideology, the phenomena of concealing production and resisting unified purchase and sale have occurred. Some cooperatives, in order to report lower yields, excessively calculate the moisture content of the grain. Some cooperatives change small dippers into large dippers and small scales into large scales when distributing grain themselves, calculating 150 jin as 100 jin. Some cooperatives deliberately leave more grain in the fields during wheat harvesting, allowing members to pick it up and divide it according to shares, or deliberately do not thresh the wheat stalks cleanly, waiting until after reporting the yield to the state before threshing and distributing it. Some cooperatives use inflated population figures or create two sets of books (one for actual production, one for false reports to the government) to retain more grain and sell less. Yangcheng County recently revealed at a meeting of township and cooperative cadres that 330 cooperatives (87% of the total) had varying degrees of concealed production. According to incomplete statistics from only 41 townships, over 720,000 jin were concealed. The Aiguo Agricultural Cooperative in Wujing Township, Ping顺县, recently discovered during a democratic inspection that since last year, the entire cooperative had concealed a total of over 58,000 jin of grain (10% of the actual yield), resulting in failure to complete the state unified purchase task. The Lancun Party Branch in Pingyao County made a decision, passed by the management committee as a whole, to underreport wheat production to the government by 18,000 jin. The seriousness of the problem lies here.

    The reasons for this phenomenon are: from the perspective of cooperative members, it is to eat more grain themselves, regardless of the interests of the state; from the perspective of cooperative cadres, some are afraid that internal contradictions among the people will not be resolved well, causing trouble, and they will bear the brunt, so they compromise and yield to the backward thinking of the peasants; individual cooperative cadres are engaging in embezzlement for personal gain. Certain county-level leading cadres turn a blind eye to this behavior of cooperatives that violates state interests, or adopt a laissez-faire and tolerant attitude. For example, after Yangcheng County discovered the phenomenon of concealed production by cooperatives, it stipulated that the concealed grain should be freely distributed by the concealing cooperatives, which actually rewarded the concealing cooperatives. Therefore, cooperative cadres who did not conceal production were opposed by the members and had no choice but to conceal production as well.

    Many township cadres and county-level leading cadres also have serious bureaucracy, listening to false reports from cooperative cadres, not thoroughly verifying production, not educating the peasants, and not actively completing the unified purchase task. In the minds of these cadres, the concept of national interest is blurred by a one-sided mass viewpoint. When capitalist ideology attacks the Party, they show weakness, powerlessness, and helplessness.

    The above situation seriously affects the completion of the state's unified purchase task, causing the state to purchase less and sell more, wasting grain and creating an unnecessary tense situation in the grain supply. In view of this situation, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Committee have decided to launch a socialist ideological education movement throughout the province and conduct a large-scale debate on grain issues. The plan is: first, to conduct ideological examinations among cadres at the county and township levels, carry out criticism and self-criticism, criticize the bureaucracy of listening to false reports and not thoroughly inspecting and verifying production, and the tailism of echoing the masses' cry that there is not enough grain and not actively completing the unified purchase task; then, among the broad masses of cooperative members, launch a mass debate, conduct education on the consistency of national interests, cooperative interests, and individual member interests, criticize the behavior of concealing production, verify this year's wheat production; explain to the members the national grain situation, further clarify the correctness of the policy of unified purchase and sale, mobilize members to actively develop production, increase grain production, and improve the current national grain situation as soon as possible.

    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 7th - Shanxi Province Huo County recently discovered several cases of agricultural cooperative cadres hiding grain. Rural cadres throughout the county have launched discussions on this, examining and criticizing localism and right-leaning passive thinking on grain issues.

    Since Huo County began summer grain purchase in July, the vast majority of township and cooperative cadres have actively verified production, paid public grain, and sold surplus grain. However, some agricultural cooperative cadres, influenced by rightists, underreported production, concealed wheat, and resisted summer grain purchase work. Han San Chou, the captain of the Han Mailing production team of the Beixing Agricultural Cooperative in Lao Zhangwan Township, and Han Sheng Guan, the statistician, hid more than 6,000 jin of wheat in one instance. Cheng Huchen, the captain of the first production team of the Chengzhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Xialeping Township, colluded with Wang Hongxi, the storekeeper who had localist thinking, to repeatedly conceal more than 1,700 jin of wheat, preparing to embezzle it collectively.

    Relevant units have dealt with these two incidents of concealing wheat. In addition to fully recovering the concealed wheat, Beixing Cooperative and Chengzhuang Cooperative also launched discussions among members to criticize the erroneous thinking and behavior of the cadres who made mistakes. The Huo County People's Committee has notified the whole county of this matter, and the Huo County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has also convened a meeting of party branch secretaries from various townships to specifically arrange a large-scale debate throughout the county, requiring each township to check and deal with all practices of theft, embezzlement, concealment of wheat, and false reporting of production, and calling on cadres with similar errors to voluntarily confess.

    克服在粮食问题上的本位主义和右倾思想
    山西检查隐瞒产量的行为
    霍县处理农业社干部隐藏粮食事件并在全县展开讨论
    本报讯　记者商恺报道：山西省广大农村，将展开粮食问题的大辩论。
    山西省不少农业生产合作社，由于资本主义思想的影响，发生了隐瞒产量、抵抗统购统销的行为。有的社为了少报产量，过多的计算粮食的含水量；有的社自己分配粮食把小斗改大斗，小秤改大秤，一百五十斤算作一百斤；有些社在割麦时，故意多舍多丢，社员拾去按股均分，或者故意不把麦秸打净，等到向国家报产量后，再打再分；有的社以多报人口或造了两本账（一本是实产账，一本是向政府报告的假账），来达到多留粮少卖粮的目的。阳城县最近在乡社干部会议上，揭发出三百三十个社（占87％）有程度不同的隐瞒产量现象。仅据其中四十一个乡的不完全统计，瞒产七十二万多斤。平顺县五井乡爱国农业社最近在民主检查中，检查出从去年以来，全社共隐瞒了五万八千多斤粮食（占实产量10％），结果没有完成国家统购任务。平遥县兰村党支部作了决定，由管委会全体通过，向政府少报小麦产量一万八千斤。问题的严重性也就在这里。
    产生这种现象的原因：从社员来说，是为了自己多吃点粮食，而不顾国家的利益；从社干部来说，有些是怕人民内部矛盾解决不好，闹起事来，自己首当其冲，因此对农民的落后思想迁就让步；个别社干部是为了自己从中贪污自肥。某些县级领导干部，对合作社这种违反国家利益的行为，竟熟视无睹，或采取姑息、宽容的态度。比如阳城县查出了合作社的瞒产现象以后，规定瞒下的粮食由瞒产社自由支配，这实际上奖励了瞒产社，因此，没有瞒产的社干部反遭到了社员们的反对，不得已也瞒起产来。
    不少乡干部和县级领导干部，还存在着严重的官僚主义，听信社干部的假报告，不深入核实产量，不向农民进行教育，不积极地完成统购任务。在这些干部的思想里，国家利益观点被片面的群众观点所模糊，他们在资本主义思想向党进攻的时候，表现了软弱无力，束手无策。
    上述情况，严重的影响了国家统购任务的完成，使国家少购多销，浪费了粮食，造成了粮食不应有的紧张局面。鉴于这种情况，中共山西省委和省人民委员会，决定在全省开展社会主义思想教育运动，并进行粮食问题的大辩论。其布署是：首先在县、乡两级干部中进行思想检查、开展批评和自我批评，批判那种听信假报告、不深入检查核实产量的官僚主义，和跟着群众叫喊粮食不够吃而不去积极完成统购任务的尾巴主义；然后在广大社员群众中，发动群众性的大辩论，进行国家利益、合作社利益和社员个人利益三者的一致性的教育，批判隐瞒产量的行为，核实今年的小麦产量；向社员说明国家粮食困难情况，进一步阐明统购统销政策的正确性，动员社员积极发展生产，增产粮食，尽快地改善目前国家粮食状况。
    据新华社太原7日电　山西省霍县最近发现农业社干部隐藏粮食事件数起。全县农村干部就此展开讨论，检查、批判在粮食问题上的本位主义和右倾消极思想。
    霍县从7月开始夏粮征购以来，绝大部分乡、社干部都积极核实产量，缴纳公粮和出售余粮，但是有的农业社干部受了右派分子影响，少报产量，隐瞒小麦，抵制夏粮征购工作。老张湾乡北星农业社韩麦岭生产队队长韩三丑和统计员韩生管，一次就隐藏小麦六千多斤。下乐平乡成庄农业社第一生产队队长成虎辰串联有本位主义思想的保管员王鸿喜等，连续掩藏小麦一千七百多斤，准备集体贪污。
    有关单位对这两起隐瞒小麦事件已作了处理。北星社和成庄社除了全部追回被隐藏的小麦以外，并且在社员中展开讨论，批判犯错误干部的错误思想和行为。霍县人民委员会已将此事通报全县，中共霍县委员会还召开各乡党支部书记会议，专门布置在全县展开大辩论，要求各乡检查和处理一切偷盗、贪污、隐藏小麦和虚报产量的做法，并号召有类似错误的干部主动交代。
