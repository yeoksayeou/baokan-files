　　Store Green Grass to Prepare Winter Fodder
　　Henan Arranges Livestock Overwintering Work Early
　  Disaster Area Masses Cut and Dry Green Grass to Store Winter Fodder
    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, August 25th: Henan Province is making early arrangements for livestock overwintering work, emphasizing that there should be no abnormal deaths of livestock this winter.

    Henan Province has made achievements in livestock protection work. In recent years, various localities have generally established livestock protection work organizations, promoted the feeding method of "separate trough feeding, dispersed to households, integration of raising and use" in vast areas, and with the strong support of the government, the physique of livestock has been significantly improved, the situation of weakness and death has been greatly changed, and 210,000 head of young livestock have been added. Due to crop reduction in some areas this summer, reduced wheat straw harvest, and water disasters in some areas in autumn, the shortage of grass is serious this year. According to preliminary estimates, the province has reduced and lost more than 4.7 billion catties of livestock feed.

    Based on this situation, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Committee have been constantly studying livestock work recently. The Provincial People's Committee issued instructions twice in early and mid-August, and convened an emergency meeting on livestock work in the province in mid-August to arrange livestock overwintering work.

    The Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Committee pointed out that the season of large-scale livestock deaths is mainly in winter and spring, and the deaths mainly occur in disaster areas. The main reason for the large-scale livestock deaths in disaster areas is the lack of feed. Therefore, all localities must pay special attention to grass storage and preservation work. It is required that grass-deficient areas store 4,000 catties of dry grass per head of livestock in the one month of August and September, to ensure that livestock can be adequately fed until the end of May next year. The Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee emphasized that the autumn harvest season is approaching, livestock are heavily used, and agricultural cooperatives should pay attention to the rational use of livestock to ensure their health.

    This newspaper reports that in order to make up for the loss of fodder due to disasters, the masses in the disaster areas of Henan Province have universally mobilized to cut and dry green grass to protect livestock from safely overwintering. In addition to planting 920,000 mu of forage grass to make up for some of the feed shortage, the Shangqiu area has also mobilized the masses to cut and dry 1.9 million catties of green grass. In the movement to cut and store grass, many agricultural cooperatives in Weishi, Lankao, Tongxu, Kaifeng and other counties have also adopted these methods: for households without firewood, one catty of dry grass is exchanged for one catty of coal from the cooperative; for households without money, one catty of dry grass is exchanged for two cents from the cooperative; for households without financial difficulties, work points are recorded. In this way, the immediate difficulties of the disaster victims are solved, and the enthusiasm of the members for cutting and storing green grass is aroused. (Zhang Chunping)

### 河南及早布置牲畜过冬工作  灾区群众割晒青草储存冬季饲料

　　贮存青草准备冬季饲料
　　河南及早布置牲畜过冬工作
　  灾区群众割晒青草储存冬季饲料
    新华社郑州25日电　河南省提前布置牲畜过冬工作，强调今冬不能有一头牲畜非正常死亡。
    河南省保护牲畜工作是有成绩的。几年来，各地普遍建立了保护牲畜工作的机构，在广大地区推行了“分槽喂养、分散到户、养用一致”的喂养方法，以及政府的大力扶持，牲畜体质已有显著提高，瘦弱死亡的情况有了很大改变，而且增加了幼畜二十一万头。由于今年夏季部分地区作物减产，麦草减收，秋季部分地区又遭水灾。今年缺草现象严重。据初步估计，全省减收和损失牲畜饲草四十七亿斤以上。
    中共河南省委员会和省人民委员会根据这一情况，近来曾不断研究牲畜工作。省人民委员会曾在8月上、中旬两次发出指示，并在中旬召开了全省牲畜工作紧急会议，布置牲畜过冬工作。
    中共河南省委员会和省人民委员会指出：牲畜大量死亡的季节主要是在冬、春两季，而死亡现象主要发生在灾区。灾区牲畜大量死亡的主要原因是缺乏饲草。因此，各地要特别注意贮草保草工作。要求缺草地区在8至9月的一个月时间，每头牲畜贮备干草四千斤，保证牲畜可足吃到明年5月底。省委和省人民委员会强调指出，秋收季节将到，牲畜使役繁重，农业社要注意合理使用牲畜，保证牲畜的健康。
    本报讯　河南省灾区群众为了弥补因灾损失的草料，普遍发动群众割晒青草，以保护牲畜安全过冬。商丘专区除已种植九十二万亩畜草弥补一部分饲草的缺乏外，并发动群众割晒了青草一百九十万斤。在割草储草运动中，尉氏、兰考、通许、开封等县许多农业社还采取了这些办法：对无柴烧的户交社一斤干草给一斤煤，对无钱户交社一斤干草给二分钱，对生活不困难的户则给记工分。这样，既解决了灾民眼前的困难，又激起社员割储青草的热情。　（张春平）
