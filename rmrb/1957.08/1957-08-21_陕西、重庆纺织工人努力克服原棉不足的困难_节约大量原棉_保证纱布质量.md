Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, August 20th: The eight cotton textile factories under the Northwest Textile Bureau in the Shaanxi area, since using low-grade cotton for spinning, have not only maintained the quality of cotton cloth, but also saved more than 66,000 kilograms of raw cotton for the state in the three months from May to July. The average first-class rate of cotton cloth in each factory has also gradually increased, and has now reached 99.23%, an increase of 1.5% over the plan.

　　Although the supply of raw cotton to the cotton textile factories is insufficient, cotton yarn production still increased by more than 3,000 pieces and cotton cloth increased by more than 9 million meters from May to July this year compared with the same period last year, due to the saving of a large amount of raw cotton, the use of low-grade cotton, and other reasons.
　
    Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, August 19th: Chongqing's cotton textile factories have saved a large amount of raw cotton this year on the basis of ensuring the quality of yarn and fabric.

　　This year, due to the insufficient supply of raw cotton, Chongqing's textile factories have used a large amount of low-grade raw cotton for spinning since the second quarter. This low-grade raw cotton contains many impurities and the fiber quality is poor, and it has basically not been used for spinning in the past. In the second quarter, the proportion of low-grade cotton used in each factory generally reached 20% to 30% of the total cotton used, and reached a maximum of 55%. Before using low-grade raw cotton for spinning, these cotton textile factories took a series of measures, centered on strengthening technical work, to ensure and improve the quality of cotton yarn as much as possible. Due to the stability of cotton yarn quality, coupled with the many measures taken by these factories in the weaving workshops to improve quality, the average first-class rate of cotton cloth in each factory reached more than 99% from January to July this year, which greatly exceeded any previous year.

　　Compared with last year, the average amount of raw cotton used for spinning one piece of yarn this year has been reduced by 2.07 kilograms. According to the national consumption standards, a total of more than 110,000 kilograms of raw cotton have been saved in seven months.

　  陕西、重庆纺织工人努力克服原棉不足的困难
　　节约大量原棉　保证纱布质量
    据新华社西安20日电　西北纺织管理局所属陕西地区八个棉纺织厂，自从利用低级棉纺纱以来，不但保持了棉布质量，而且从5月到7月的三个月内，还为国家节约原棉六万六千多公斤。各厂平均棉布一等品率也逐步上升，目前已经达到99.23％，比计划提高了1.5％。
    各棉纺织厂原棉虽然供应不足，但是由于节约大量原棉，利用低级棉，以及其他原因，今年5月至7月同去年同期比较，棉纱产量仍然增加了三千多件，棉布增加了九百多万公尺。
    据新华社重庆19日电　重庆各棉纺织厂今年在保证纱布质量的基础上节约了大量原棉。
  今年重庆各纺织厂因为原棉供应不足，从第二季度起大量掺用了低级原棉纺纱。这种低级原棉含杂质多，纤维质量差，过去基本上没有用来纺过纱。第二季度各厂一般掺用的比例达到占总用棉的20％到30％，最高时达到55％。在使用低级原棉纺纱以前，这些棉纺织厂就以加强技术工作为中心，采取了一系列的措施，来尽可能保证和提高棉纱的质量。由于棉纱质量的稳定，加上这些工厂在织布车间采取了许多提高质量的措施，今年1月到7月份，各厂棉布平均上等品率达到了99％以上，大大超过了以往任何一年。
    同去年相比，今年平均每纺一件纱所用的原棉降低了二点零七公斤。按国家规定的消耗标准计算，七个月来节约原棉共达十一万多公斤。
