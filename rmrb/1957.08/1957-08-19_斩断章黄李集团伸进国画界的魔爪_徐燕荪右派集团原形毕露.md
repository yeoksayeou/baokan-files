Xinhua News Agency, August 17th: At five symposiums held from August 3rd to 16th by the Ministry of Culture, the Chinese Artists Association, and the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles, after exposure and pursuit, it was initially confirmed that the rightist feudal ringleader group headed by Xu Yansun, vice president of the Chinese Painting Academy, was an anti-Party claw extended into the capital's traditional Chinese painting circles by the Agricultural and Labor Democratic Party rightist leaders Zhang Bojun, Huang Qixiang, Li Boqiu, and Li Jiansheng.

Xu Yansun, Wang Xuetao, Ye Gongchuo, Wang Shengsheng, and others had close relationships with Zhang Bojun and others. These rightist leaders openly announced that Wang Xuetao, Ye Gongchuo, and others were responsible for the Agricultural and Labor Democratic Party in literary and art circles and wanted them to take the lead in the traditional Chinese painting circles to massively develop the organization for the Agricultural and Labor Democratic Party. At a forum convened by Zhang Bojun and others at the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Cultural Club, they instructed them to set fires in the capital's traditional Chinese painting circles. Xu Yansun, Wang Xuetao, Ye Gongchuo, and others then held a symposium at Rong Bao Zhai to attack the Communist Party. Xu Yansun also privately organized a "core group" with Wang Xuetao, Ye Gongchuo, and others to plan anti-communist activities and expand the anti-communist organization. They also established a rule: "What we say is not allowed to be said to outsiders, otherwise, we must investigate."

Many traditional Chinese painters unanimously pointed out at the meeting that Xu Yansun had carried out a series of conspiracies since liberation in order to usurp the Communist Party's leadership in the traditional Chinese painting circles. According to Zhao Guodong's disclosure: In 1953, when the Chinese Painting Research Association was re-electing the executive committee nominations, Xu wrote him a letter emphasizing that the Painting Association "should handle everything ourselves, brew it ourselves, and negotiate it ourselves," and should not be led by the Communist Party. He asked Zhao Guodong to "think for himself" so that he could exclusively control the leadership of the traditional Chinese painting circles.

It was revealed at the meeting that Xu Yansun had always adopted despicable two-faced tactics such as sowing discord and drawing in and attacking others to establish his feudal leadership in the traditional Chinese painting circles. At a symposium, Pan Jiezhi and Li Dacheng talked about some opinions of traditional Chinese painters to unite. After the meeting, Xu took an anonymous letter he wrote himself to threaten Pan and Li, telling them to "be careful." Bu Xiaohuai pointed out: Xu Yansun praised Liu Jiyu's youth and talent in front of him at the Fine Arts Publishing House, but behind his back, he scolded Liu for "being young and successful, and losing his head." Hou Kai and others also revealed that after the establishment of the Beijing Chinese Painting Academy, Xu Yansun and Wang Xuetao made promises and recruited people at Rong Bao Zhai, proclaiming that they wanted to "kick out Rong Bao Zhai."

According to everyone's revelation, as early as twenty years ago, the deceased old painter Huang Binhong pointed out that "Xu Yansun is a hooligan in the traditional Chinese painting circles." In a painting exhibition organized by Jin Beilou in 1926, Xu Yansun, because his paintings were not sold, despicably scraped off pieces of color from Guan Pinghu's paintings. During the Japanese puppet period, Xu Yansun colluded with Japanese puppet agents and forced people to buy his paintings. During the Kuomintang reactionary rule, Xu Yansun painted and Qi Gong inscribed words to Chiang Kai-shek to "celebrate his sixtieth birthday." After liberation, Xu Yansun often publicized his relationship with the Agricultural and Labor Democratic Party rightist leaders Zhang Bojun, Huang Qixiang, and the counter-revolutionary Yang Hu.

At the meeting, it was also revealed that many of the so-called "master painter's" "works" were plagiarized from other people's labor. The Fine Arts Publishing House commissioned him to paint "Three Attacks on Zhujiazhuang" in 1953. He took more than 500 yuan in royalties, but not only has he not submitted the manuscript to date, but the part that has been painted is still plagiarized from Zhao Hongben.

Everyone pointed out that Xu Yansun has always hated the Communist Party. According to Bu Xiaohuai and Hou Kai, Xu once slandered and said that "American dogs are stronger than the Communist Party." Everyone also revealed that Xu Yansun had spread rumors to provoke the relationship between Qi Baishi and the Ministry of Culture. The meeting pointed out that the anti-communist activities carried out by Xu Yansun, Wang Xuetao, and others were organized and planned. Xu Yansun has many civil and military officials, strategists, and thugs under his command. Everyone demanded that Xu's henchmen Jin Xiezong, Wu Xingsun, Qi Gong, and others also stand up to expose and confess. Under everyone's stern rebuke, Wang Xuetao only admitted a little about his relationship with the Agricultural and Labor Democratic Party rightists, but it was very incomplete, while Xu Yansun still refused to confess his crimes.

    斩断章黄李集团伸进国画界的魔爪
    徐燕荪右派集团原形毕露
    新华社17日讯　文化部、中国美术家协会、北京市文联在8月3日到16日的五次座谈会上，经过揭发和追击，初步证实以中国画院副院长徐燕荪为首的右派封建把头集团是农工民主党右派头子章伯钧、黄琪翔、李伯球、李健生等伸进首都国画界的一只反党魔爪。
    徐燕荪、王雪涛、叶恭绰、汪慎生等与章伯钧等关系密切。这些右派头子公开宣布王雪涛、叶恭绰等为农工民主党在文艺界的负责人，并要他们在国画界中带头，为农工民主党大量发展组织。章伯钧等在全国政协文化俱乐部召集的六界座谈会上，指示他们在首都国画界中放火，徐燕荪、王雪涛、叶恭绰等就在荣宝斋召开了一次向共产党进攻的座谈会。徐燕荪还与王雪涛、叶恭绰等人私下组织了一个“核心小组”，策划反共活动，扩大反共组织。他们还订出一条纪律：“我们的话不许向外人说，否则一定要追究的。”
    许多国画家在会上一致指出，徐燕荪为了篡夺共产党在国画界的领导权，解放后进行了一系列的阴谋活动。据赵国栋揭露：1953年国画研究会改选执委提名时，徐曾给他写信，强调画会“一切事应由自己办、自己酝酿、自己协商”，不要共产党来领导。他要求赵国栋为徐“自己着想”，使他能独揽国画界的领导大权。
    会上有人揭露，徐燕荪为了建立他在国画界的封建领导势力，一贯采用挑拨离间、拉拢打击等卑鄙的两面派手法。在一次座谈会上，潘洁兹和李大成谈了一些国画家要团结的意见，会后，徐就拿着一封他自己写的匿名信，向潘、李进行威胁，要他俩“小心”。卜孝怀指出：徐燕荪在美术出版社当面捧刘继卣年少有为，背后又骂刘是“少年得志，冲昏头脑”。侯恺等还揭露了北京中国画院成立之后，徐燕荪和王雪涛在荣宝斋许愿拉人，他们宣扬，要“把荣宝斋踢了”。
    据大家揭露，早在二十年前，已逝世的老画家黄宾虹就指出“徐燕荪是国画界的流氓”，1926年在金北楼组织的一次画展中，徐燕荪因自己的画没卖出去，就卑鄙地将管平湖的画上的颜色一块一块地挖掉。在日伪时候，徐燕荪勾结日伪特务，硬派卖画。国民党反动统治时期，徐燕荪画画、启功题词给蒋介石“祝贺六十寿辰”。解放后，徐燕荪经常宣扬他与农工民主党右派头子章伯钧、黄琪翔以及反革命分子杨虎的关系。
    会上，还揭露了这个所谓“名画家”的“作品”，不少是抄袭别人的劳动成果。美术出版社在1953年约他画的“三打祝家庄”，他拿了五百多元稿费，不仅迄今还未交稿，而且已画好的一部分也还是抄袭赵宏本的。
    大家指出，徐燕荪一贯仇视共产党。据卜孝怀和侯恺等揭露，徐曾污蔑说“美国的狗都比共产党强”。大家还揭露，徐燕荪曾造谣挑拨齐白石与文化部的关系。会上指出，徐燕荪、王雪涛等所进行的反共活动是有组织有计划的。在徐燕荪手下有不少的文官武将，参谋打手。大家要求徐的爪牙金协中、吴行荪、启功等也站出来揭发和交代。在大家的严词斥责下，王雪涛只吞吞吐吐地承认了一点与农工民主党右派的关系，但很不彻底，而徐燕荪则仍然拒不交代自己的罪行。
