The Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a meeting of secretaries of prefectural, municipal, and county committees in early and mid-August. The meeting analyzed the current situation in rural areas, discussed and arranged the unified purchase and sale of grain before this year's autumn harvest, and decided to conduct large-scale socialist education in rural areas.

The meeting believed that the basic situation in rural areas was good. In the previous period, some party organizations had right-leaning thoughts and could not distinguish between the enemy and ourselves; they had a one-sided mass viewpoint and departmentalism on the grain issue. The meeting believed that these unhealthy thoughts should be criticized based on the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's instructions on carrying out socialist education for the entire rural population.

The meeting focused on the grain issue. Last year, disaster areas in Jiangsu purchased less and sold more by 2.37 billion jin of grain, while non-disaster areas also saw unreasonable situations of increased production but less purchase and sale, resulting in a provincial deficit of 560 million jin of grain. This year, the province's grain output is estimated to increase by 1 billion jin compared to last year. According to the spirit of "using surplus to make up for deficiencies," efforts should be made to purchase more and sell less.

　　江苏开会分析农村形势
    本报讯　中共江苏省委于8月上、中旬举行了地、市、县委书记会议。会议分析了农村的当前形势，讨论和部署了今年秋收前粮食的统购统销工作，并决定在农村进行大规模的社会主义教育。
    会议认为，农村的基本形势是好的。前一时期，党内若干组织有右倾思想，分不清敌我矛盾；在粮食问题上有片面的群众观点和本位主义。这些不健康的思想，会议认为应该根据中共中央关于向全体农村人口进行社会主义教育的指示加以批判。
    会议着重讨论了粮食问题。去年江苏灾区少购多销了二十三亿七千万斤粮食，而非灾区也出现了增产而少购多销的不合理情况，结果全省购销相抵，亏空了五亿六千万斤粮食。今年全省粮食产量估计比去年增产十亿斤，根据“以丰补歉”的精神，应该争取多购少销。
