    Jilin Provincial Department of Education Requires Local Private Schools to Conduct Socialist Education for Farmers During the Hoe-Hanging Period
    (Our Dispatch) The Jilin Provincial Department of Education recently issued instructions on vigorously carrying out socialist ideological education in private schools. The instructions stated that the rural areas are currently in the hoe-hanging period. All localities should, in conjunction with production and rectification of cooperatives, conduct socialist ideological education in a led, widespread, and in-depth manner. Through this education, the socialist consciousness of cadres and the masses should be raised, production promoted, and the relationship between the Party and the masses be strengthened. Local private schools should use the original students as a foundation and initiate all literate and illiterate members of the cooperatives, members of the literacy associations, and all laboring members in the countryside who can listen to lectures and learn to read, to come to the private schools to listen to socialist ideological education classes. The original classes can be reorganized and expanded. While conducting socialist ideological education, the resumption of classes during the hoe-hanging period should be thoroughly carried out to encourage more farmers to participate in literacy learning. The study time of the private schools can be unified with the time for socialist ideological education in the townships.
    The instructions stated: In the future, the quality of a private school will be measured by, among other things, how well socialist ideological education is carried out, which will be considered a major factor. After the end of the hoe-hanging period, on the basis of a general increase in socialist consciousness among the students, active preparations should be made for this winter's farmers' spare-time cultural studies to create conditions for vigorously carrying out this winter's learning.

    吉林省教育厅要求各地民校
    在挂锄期间向农民进行一次社会主义教育
    本报讯　吉林省教育厅最近发出关于在民校中大力开展社会主义思想教育的指示。指示中说，目前农村正处在挂锄期间，各地要结合生产、整社，有领导地、广泛深入地开展社会主义思想教育，并通过这一教育以达到提高干部和群众的社会主义觉悟，推动生产，密切党与群众的关系。各地民校应以原有的学员为基础，发起所有的识字的和不识字的社员，扫盲协会的会员，农村中一切能够听讲的、学习识字的劳动成员，都到民校里来听社会主义思想教育课，原来的班级可以重编扩大。在进行社会主义思想教育的同时，要把挂锄期间的复课工作彻底搞好，争取更多的农民参加学习识字。民校的学习时间可以和乡里进行社会主义思想教育的时间统一起来。
    指示说：今后衡量一处民校的好坏，社会主义思想教育进行得如何做为主要内容之一。挂锄结束之后，在广大学员普遍地提高了社会主义觉悟的基础上，积极酝酿好今年冬季的农民业余文化学习，为大力开展今冬学习创造条件。
