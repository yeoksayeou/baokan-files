What a Dangerous, Vicious, and Ruthless Conspiracy:
　　An Inside Look at the Luo Longji Anti-Communist Group
    Core members were Zhang Dongsun, Ye Duyi, Zhou Jingwen, Pan Guangdan, and Zeng Zhaolun
　　Some shocking materials were revealed at the Eighth Rectification Meeting of the China Democratic League.
    (Our dispatch) The Luo Longji anti-communist group, including Zhang Dongsun, has been further exposed. This is an organized, planned, and programmatic anti-communist conspiracy group. Since 1949, this group has engaged in a series of anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist conspiracy and criminal activities. Its core members include Ye Duyi, Zhou Jingwen, Pan Guangdan, and Zeng Zhaolun.
    This was revealed at the Eighth Enlarged Rectification Forum of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League on the 19th.

　　Luo Longji tried to muddle through by only talking about the distant past, not the recent past, only talking about history, not the present.
    Shi Liang, Vice Chairman of the China Democratic League, who presided over the meeting, spoke first. She affirmed that Luo Longji had confessed some problems last time; and pointed out that Luo Longji only talked about the distant past in his confession (of course, he also had many important problems before liberation that he did not confess) and not the recent past, talked about historical problems and not the anti-communist conspiracy activities after liberation. Shi Liang said that Luo Longji and Zhang Dongsun and others formed an organized, programmatic, planned, and concrete action anti-communist group in 1949, which was not what Luo Longji said was a "formless organization" or "factional struggle" within the League. She demanded that Luo Longji must thoroughly confess the criminal activities of this anti-communist group, especially the more covert secret activities of this anti-communist group after 1952, and all the facts about how this anti-communist group developed into the Zhang-Luo alliance. Shi Liang said that there is sufficient material to prove that this anti-communist group has never stopped its activities since 1952 until today, but has only adopted a more covert approach.
    When Luo Longji confessed his problems, on the one hand, he admitted that he had actively engaged in sectarianism and had a "formless organization" from 1949 to 1952; on the other hand, he said that his "formless organization" no longer existed after 1952. However, Luo Longji did not dare to completely deny in this confession that his small group still had activities after 1952. He said that after 1952, "this formless organization did not break off in spirit and friendship." When the China Democratic League held its Second National Congress in 1956, he had met and talked with some people in the "formless organization." He had talked with Sun Dayu twice, and Zeng Zhaolun and Peng Wenyin were also present. He admitted that he had read Sun Dayu's 80,000-word "indictment" of the Party's wild attacks. In addition, he said that he had also talked with Peng Wenyin in Shanghai, Jiang Zhenzhong in Zhejiang, and Li Dejia in Kunming. Luo Longji also admitted that when he inspected Sichuan in 1956, he convened a forum for intellectuals (Ma Zhemin also participated), and those who participated were people with dissatisfaction and complaints. His subsequent speech reflected the opinions of these people. He said that he met with Pan Dakui every day during this period, and criticized Pan for not letting go of developing the organization, and encouraged Pan to actively engage in League affairs and let go of developing the organization. He said that Fan Puzhai invited him to dinner in Chengdu, and Ma Zhemin, Pan Dakui, Zhang Songtao, and others were also present. Luo Longji also talked with Ma Zhemin about the work of the Hubei League, encouraged Ma to "actively take responsibility," and said, "After long-term coexistence and mutual supervision, democratic parties have a great future and should not be passive." Luo Longji said that in 1955, he also advised Dai Jinsheng, deputy secretary-general of the Hubei Democratic League, to support Ma Zhemin as the chairman of the Hubei Provincial League. Luo Longji said that when he passed by Shanghai in 1955, Han Ming invited him to dinner at home, and all those who were invited were people from the Shanghai small group. Luo Longji advised them to do a good job in the League under the leadership of Shen Zhiyuan, and asked them to support Shen Zhiyuan, saying that Shen Zhiyuan was the most suitable person to lead the Shanghai League. Luo Longji admitted that when he spoke at the National People's Congress and the CPPCC, the drafts of his speeches were discussed with Zeng Zhaolun, Fei Xiaotong, Wu Jingchao, Pan Guangdan, and others. At the same time, he often talked with these people about the issue of intellectuals. Everyone stood on the side of the bourgeoisie to sympathize with backward intellectuals. Then, Luo Longji actually gave everyone a summary report on the work of the League. He, as the vice chairman of the China Democratic League, talked a lot about the responsibilities he, as a leader, should bear for the current bad situation of the China Democratic League, and talked about a lot of irrelevant things. At this point, everyone could no longer tolerate Luo Longji's bad attitude. Chairman Shi Liang stopped his "confession" according to everyone's request, and asked everyone to expose his crimes.

　　A secret letter from Luo Longji to Zhao Wenbi
    In previous confessions, Luo Longji always said that his purpose in forming a small group was to compete for power and profit and engage in factional struggles within the League, not to oppose the Communist Party and the people. At this meeting, Sa Kongliao read a secret letter written by Luo Longji to Zhao Wenbi in his own handwriting. This secret letter proves how the Luo Longji group, including Zhang Dongsun, planned, step-by-step, and organizedly developed their anti-communist conspiracy group across the country, and how they attempted to use the opportunity of the Party's last rectification to attack the Party. This letter was written by Luo Longji to Zhao Wenbi on August 2, 1950 (two months after the outbreak of the Korean War). The end of the letter said, "This letter can only be read by close friends who can truly cooperate, and must not be widely circulated. Please ask all friends not to publicize it, and be careful." It contains the following passage:

    "Recently, I have discussed with Dongsun, Guangdan, Zhaolun and other brothers many times, and we all believe that we should make planned and step-by-step efforts to develop nationwide. This is not only the hope of the friendly party for the future of the China Democratic League, but also the only way for us to gain a foothold in the League. In the southwest, those who can cooperate with us have also returned to work hard to arrange things. In the early days of liberation, the left-leaning and naive people monopolized everything, just like the practice of the East China Executive Department in the past. After this review in the League, Chu Tunan has admitted his mistakes and has cancelled the South China Special Envoy, and has established the Southwest General Branch, and the Southwest leaders who were previously excluded are all members of the General Branch. This change in the general trend was unexpected by them. Before the friendly party recently carried out rectification and party consolidation, I frankly raised this opinion to the friendly party. At that time, my opinion was compiled into the following four sentences: Relax the united front and grasp the party tightly, use the Common Program to measure the length, Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Mao Zedong, patiently study and understand everything. The main intention is that the Common Program can only be used as the standard for the united front, and ideological issues cannot be used to dismantle the united front, so that a group of politicians can succeed by luck. At the same time, there are too many party members, and they must be reorganized. When I raised this opinion, the League took the opportunity to attack. Later, the leading party expressed that this was the way to do it, and the boring people in the League were speechless. If we grasp this situation, everything will be easy to do. We recently discussed that we plan to take advantage of the summer vacation to have Dongsun, Guangdan, and Zhaolun come to Shanghai to discuss the development plan of the League's affairs with friends in Shanghai, and to discuss how to rectify the League's affairs in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Jiangsu. However, I don't know if friends in Shanghai think this trip is necessary. After you receive this letter, please gather a few reliable friends who can truly cooperate and have a secret talk. If you think it is useful, please reply by letter."
    Qian Jiaju and Chu Tunan revealed in their speeches that Luo Longji and Zhang Dongsun analyzed the domestic and international situation from a reactionary standpoint during the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. They believed that the people's democratic regime was unstable and that the Chinese people could not win the war. They fantasized that the US and Chiang Kai-shek would counterattack the mainland through the Korean War and become a confrontational situation, so that they could do something and play a more important role. They felt that it was good for them to only serve as members of the Central People's Government at that time, because this way, "the relationship with the Communist Party is not deep. If they are contaminated too much, it will be detrimental to them if the situation changes."

    Two modes of activity of the anti-communist small group. Ye Duyi, another main member of the Luo Longji anti-communist group, also revealed the conspiracy activities of this group. Ye Duyi said that there were two modes of activity for their "small circle" (that is, the Luo Longji anti-communist group including Zhang Dongsun): one was the "small circle" gathering limited to the League, and the other was the dinner party including people outside the League. The people invited from outside the League were mainly university professors, called "meeting friends with literature" and studying academic knowledge. The real purpose was, if possible, to pull them into the League as people in the small circle, and even if they could not be pulled into the League, they could expand their influence in society, especially in the education sector. At the beginning of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, some people from this anti-communist group held a meeting at Liu Wang Liming's house to study the current situation. Luo Longji speculated from Marshall's resignation as Secretary of State and taking up the important post of Minister of Defense that the United States was preparing to launch a third world war. Zhou Jingwen speculated that the United States might occupy the Northeast, and Zhang Dongsun said that he wanted to advise Chairman Mao to abandon the "one-sided" diplomatic policy. According to Ye Duyi's revelation, Luo Longji and Zhang Dongsun often jointly planned personnel arrangements at the beginning of liberation. After the CPPCC meeting in 1949, Zhang Dongsun was elected as a member of the Central People's Government and a member of the National Committee of the CPPCC by virtue of the China Democratic League. After Zhang Dongsun and Luo Longji discussed it, they transferred the CPPCC member seat to Zeng Zhaolun without discussing it through the China Democratic League organization. Zeng Zhaolun took the position of Vice Minister of the Ministry of Higher Education in 1951, which was also jointly discussed by Zeng and Zhang Luo in advance.
    Guan Shixiong revealed in his speech some facts about the Luo Longji anti-communist group, including Zhang Dongsun, fighting with the Party for intellectuals, fighting for leadership in the education sector, opposing the adjustment of departments and faculties, and opposing curriculum reform. In May 1950, this anti-communist group convened a symposium on higher education in the name of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the China Democratic League to oppose the adjustment of departments and faculties and curriculum reform. Zhang Dongsun presided over the symposium in his capacity as the director of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the China Democratic League. Chen Xinmin, Pan Guangdan, Qian Duansheng, Zeng Zhaolun, Lu Zhiwei, Qian Weichang, Fei Xiaotong, Zhang Boju, and others participated in the symposium, most of whom were backbone right-wing elements. This symposium presided over by the Zhang Luo group has the same anti-socialist nature as the six professors' meeting presided over by the Zhang Luo alliance in June this year. At this symposium, Fei Xiaotong clamored that "running specialized subjects in universities is like building a tall tower on sand." Zeng Zhaolun said, "The fact that university graduates in the old society had nothing to do was because the social conditions were bad, not because students couldn't find something to do. After liberation, college students can't do things instead." He also said, "The Communist Party comes up with a plan and asks everyone to follow it, which is not only unworkable but also restricts the creativity of university professors," etc. Pan Guangdan opposed training specialists urgently needed for national construction. They advocated retaining the departments and faculties of the old universities and opposed adjusting the departments and faculties of universities across the country to meet the needs of national economic construction.

    Luo Longji convened a meeting, and John Leighton Stuart attended and gave guidance.
    At this meeting, Ye Duyi, Pu Xixiu, Qian Duansheng, and Luo Ziwei further revealed the relationship between Luo Longji and American imperialist elements and Li Zongren. According to Ye Duyi, Chiang Kai-shek had announced the China Democratic League as an illegal organization in November 1947. At that time, Ye Duyi and others went to Nanjing to find Luo Longji to discuss how to deal with it. Luo Longji not only arranged their meeting in the US embassy, ​​but also asked John Leighton Stuart to "attend and guide" their discussion several times. John Leighton Stuart also openly put forward the arrogant proposition that the China Democratic League should "dissolve gloriously" and that they should participate in political activities as individuals. In 1948, the anti-American movement of students across the country broke out. John Leighton Stuart issued an extremely arrogant and shameless statement, threatening Chinese students with "reaping what they sow," which aroused great anger among students across the country. Luo Longji, this democratic person, actually wrote a letter to John Leighton Stuart and asked Ye Duyi to take it to Nanjing, and "regretted" for John Leighton Stuart in a posture of "being grieved by loved ones." John Leighton Stuart expressed his gratitude for this "friendship method" - John Leighton Stuart's original words. Pu Xixiu revealed that just when Luo Longji asked Wu Han to bring a letter to Shen Junru, asking to reserve the conditions for the China Democratic League to withdraw from the joint government at any time, Luo Longji actually said in a letter congratulating Li Zongren on his election victory that the China Democratic League had not said that it did not recognize the "puppet National Assembly" and the "puppet constitution," but only said "reserved"! Pu Xixiu said that these two "reservations" were related. The former was "reserving" the right to withdraw from the joint government, and the latter was "reserving" the right to participate in the Nanjing puppet government at any time. According to Pu Xixiu, after the CCP issued the "May 1st Call" to organize a joint government in 1948, Luo Longji sent Ye Duyi to Nanjing to actively inquire about John Leighton Stuart's opinions, asking John Leighton Stuart to support Li Zongren. Luo Longji also discussed with Lei Zhen, wanting to take advantage of the name of recuperating in another place to carry out anti-communist activities in Nanjing, Gulangyu or Taiwan, etc., but Zhang Lan stopped him and it was not realized. Luo Longji's estimate of the situation at that time was that it would take at least five years. Facts prove that Luo Longji and Zhang Bojun were in contact at that time. At that time, Zhang Bojun wanted to launch the military forces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou in Hong Kong to divide the world with the Communist Party, and Luo Longji also said in a letter to Pu Xixiu: "Your excessive optimism about the situation, thinking that the Kuomintang is about to collapse, is wrong. According to Hong Kong's estimates, the situation will last for five years, and Hong Kong is still launching the military forces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou!" Who else is this so-called Hong Kong party but Zhang Bojun!
    In Qian Duansheng's confession, he talked about the following issues: In the spring and summer of 1934, Qian Duansheng went to Nanjing to see Chiang Kai-shek. Chiang knew that Luo was in Tianjin and asked Qian to tell Luo: as long as he was safe, he could still go to Nanjing to be an official. Luo Longji's wife, Wang Youjia, in Kunming was a secret agent related to the Military Command. Qian Duansheng also revealed the collusion between Luo Longji and Miao Yuntai, a powerful lackey of American imperialism. At that time, Qian Duansheng ran "Today's Review" in Yunnan, and the funds were obtained from Miao Yuntai through Luo Longji. Luo Ziwei revealed that Luo Longji insisted on placing the counter-revolutionary element Luo Zimei (who had been sentenced) in the Propaganda Committee of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, which he presided over. Hua Luogeng also spoke at the meeting, revealing some shameless acts of how Luo Longji wooed him and used him.
    Finally, Shi Liang announced that in order to give Luo Longji a chance to start anew, Luo Longji would still be asked to confess the conspiracy activities of the Luo Longji small group, including Zhang Dongsun, at the next meeting. At the same time, it was hoped that other members of this anti-communist group would thoroughly and thoroughly reveal the conspiracy activities of this anti-communist group.

    好险恶毒辣的阴谋
　　看罗隆基反共集团的内幕
    核心分子是张东荪、叶笃义、周鲸文、潘光旦、曾昭抡
　　民盟第八次整风会上揭露出一些怵目惊心的材料
    本报讯　包括张东荪在内的罗隆基反共集团已经进一步暴露。这是一个有组织有计划有纲领的反共阴谋集团。这个集团在1949年以后进行了一系列反共反人民反社会主义的阴谋罪恶活动。它的核心分子有叶笃义、周鲸文、潘光旦和曾昭抡等。
    这是19日民盟中央第八次扩大整风座谈会上被揭露出来的。
　　只谈远的不谈近的，只谈历史不谈现在，罗隆基企图蒙混过关
    主持会议的民盟副主席史良在会上首先发言。她肯定了罗隆基上次交代了一些问题；并指出，罗隆基在交代中只谈远的（当然，就是解放前他也有许多重要问题没有交代）不谈近的，谈历史问题而不谈解放以后反共阴谋活动。史良说罗隆基同张东荪等在1949年成立的是一个有组织、有纲领、有计划、有具体行动的反共集团，并不如罗隆基所说的是什么“无形组织”和盟内“派系斗争”。她要求：罗隆基必须彻底交代这个反共集团的罪恶活动、尤其1952年以后这个反共集团的更隐蔽的秘密活动，以及这个反共集团怎样发展成章罗联盟的全部事实。史良说，有充分的材料证明，这个反共集团在1952年以后直到今天，一天也没有停止过活动，只是采取了更隐蔽的方式而已。
    罗隆基交代问题时，一方面承认1949年—1952年，他积极地搞过宗派，有过“无形组织”；另一方面又说他的“无形组织”在1952年以后不再存在了。但是罗隆基在这次交代中已不敢完全否认他的小集团在1952年以后还有活动。他说，在1952年后，“这个无形组织在精神上和友谊上并没有断绝”。1956年民盟举行第二次全国代表大会时，他曾同“无形组织”中的有些人见过面谈过话，他曾约孙大雨谈过两次话，曾昭抡和彭文应也在场。他承认他看过孙大雨向党猖狂进攻的八万言的“控告书”。此外，他说他同上海的彭文应、浙江的姜震中、昆明的李德家也分别谈过话。罗隆基还承认1956年他在四川视察时，曾召集了知识分子座谈会（马哲民也参加了），参加的都是有不满情绪和牢骚的人。他以后的发言就反映了这些人的意见。他说，这一期间他每天都同潘大逵见面，曾经批评潘不敢放手发展组织，鼓励潘积极搞盟务，放手发展组织。他说，在成都范朴斋请他吃过饭，在场的还有马哲民、潘大逵、张松涛等。罗隆基还同马哲民谈过湖北盟的工作，鼓励马“积极负责”，并且说，“长期共存互相监督以后，民主党派大有前途，不应该消极”。罗隆基说他在1955年还曾劝湖北民盟副秘书长戴今生支持马哲民做湖北省盟的主任委员。罗隆基说，1955年路过上海时，韩鸣曾请他在家吃过饭，应邀而来的全是上海小集团的人。罗隆基劝他们在沈志远领导下好好做盟的工作，叫他们拥护沈志远，说沈志远是领导上海盟的最适宜的人。罗隆基承认，他在人大，政协发言时，发言稿事先和曾昭抡、费孝通、吴景超、潘光旦等商议过，同时常同这些人谈知识分子问题，大家都是站在资产阶级方面同情落后知识分子。接着，罗隆基竟然向大家做起盟的工作的总结报告来。他俨然以民盟副主席的身份，大谈他作为一个领导人对民盟今天的恶劣局面应负的责任，东拉西扯地谈了一大套。至此，大家对罗隆基的这种恶劣态度再也容忍不下去了。主席史良根据大家要求制止了他的“交代”，让大家来揭发他的罪行。
　　罗隆基给赵文璧的一封密信
    罗隆基在历次交代中总说他搞小集团的目的是在盟内争权夺利进行派系斗争，而不是反共反人民。这次会上，萨空了宣读了罗隆基给赵文璧的一封亲笔密信。这封密信证明包括张东荪在内的罗隆基集团怎样有计划、有步骤、有组织地在全国发展他们的反共阴谋集团，怎样企图利用上次党整风的机会向党进攻，这封信是罗隆基1950年8月2日（即朝鲜战争爆发后两个月）写给赵文璧的。信尾说“此函只可与真能合作之好友阅看，切勿广为传观，并请诸友切勿在外宣扬，切切”。其中有这样一段话：
    “最近与东荪、光旦、昭抡兄等多次详谈，均认为我辈应在全国范围内作有计划、有步骤的努力开展，此固友党希望民盟今后之前途，同时亦为我辈在盟中站稳脚步之唯一办法。西南方面，我辈能合作之人亦已回去努力布置。解放初期，左倾幼稚者亦如过去华东执行部之作法，一手霸占。经此次在盟中检讨，楚图南已承认彼之错误，已将华南特派员取消，且已成立西南总支部，而前次被排挤之西南领导人，均为总支部委员。大势如此转变，固非彼辈所料及也。在友党最近进行整风整党以前，弟曾坦白向友党提过此项意见。当时弟之意见，编为下列四句话：放宽统战抓紧党，共同纲领量长短，马恩列斯毛泽东，耐心学习都搞通。主要用意即只能用共同纲领做统战标准，不能用思想问题来拆散统战，使一班政客幸进。同时党员太杂，必须加以整理，当弟提此意见时，盟中又借题攻击。后来领导党表示如此作法，而盟中无聊之徒始哑口无言了。我辈把握此形势则一切好做。最近我们商量，拟乘暑假之便，由东荪、光旦、昭抡三位来沪一行，与沪上诸友商量盟务发展计划，并就近商讨如何整顿沪、宁、苏等地盟务。惟不知沪上诸友认为此行有必要否？你们得此函后，请约集真正可合作之少数可靠朋友，秘密一谈。如认为有用，即请函复。”
  　千家驹和楚图南在发言中都揭露了罗隆基和张东荪在抗美援朝时，站在反动立场分析国内外形势的情况，他们认为人民民主政权不稳定，中国人民在战争中不能取得胜利，幻想美蒋通过朝鲜战争反攻大陆，成为对峙局面，这样他们就可以有所作为，发挥更多、更重要的作用。他们觉得自己当时在中央人民政府中只担任委员也好，因为这样子“与共产党关系不深，沾染多了以后，局势变了对自己不利。”
    反共小集团的两种活动方式　罗隆基反共集团的另一主要成员叶笃义也揭露了这个集团的阴谋活动。叶笃义说他们这个“小圈子”（即包括张东荪在内的罗隆基反共集团）的活动方式有两种：一种是限于盟内的“小圈子”集会，一种是包括了盟外人士的聚餐会。约请的盟外人士以大学教授为主，名为“以文会友”，研究学问，真正的目的是，如果可能就把他们拉进盟来作为小圈子里的人，即使拉不进盟，也可以扩大他们在社会上，尤其是在教育界的影响。抗美援朝开始时，这个反共集团的一些人曾在刘王立明家里开会，研究时局，罗隆基从马歇尔辞国务卿重任国防部长这件事推测，美国有进行第三次世界大战的准备。周鲸文则推测美国有占领东北的可能，张东荪就说他要劝毛主席放弃“一边倒”的外交政策。据叶笃义揭露，解放之初罗隆基与张东荪经常共同策划人事安排。1949年政协会议以后，张东荪以民盟的关系当选为中央人民政府委员和全国政协委员。张东荪和罗隆基商量以后，未通过民盟组织的讨论，就擅自把政协委员让给曾昭抡。曾昭抡1951年就任高教部副部长的职务，事先也是由曾和张罗共同商定的。
    关世雄在发言中揭发了包括张东荪在内的罗隆基反共集团和党争夺知识分子、争夺在教育界的领导权、反对院系调整、反对课程改革的一些事实。1950年5月，这个反共集团以民盟文教委员会名义召开了一次高等教育座谈会反对院系调整和课程改革。张东荪以民盟文教委员会主任身份主持座谈。参加座谈的有陈新民、潘光旦、钱端升、曾昭抡、陆志韦、钱伟长、费孝通、张伯驹等，大多都是右派骨干分子。张罗集团主持的这次座谈会，同今年6月间章罗联盟主持的六教授会议具有同样的反社会主义性质。在这个座谈会上费孝通叫嚣“在大学里搞专科像是在沙土上造高塔”。曾昭抡说什么“旧社会大学毕业生没事做是社会条件不好，不是学生找到事做不了。解放后，大学生反而办不了事。”又说“共产党拿出一个方案要大家照办，不但行不通而且还约束大学教授的创造性”等。潘光旦则反对培养国家建设急需的专才。他们主张保留旧大学的院系，反对配合国家经济建设的需要调整全国大学院系。
    罗隆基召集会议，司徒雷登列席指导
    在这次会议上，叶笃义、浦熙修、钱端升、罗子为还进一步地揭露了罗隆基和美帝国主义分子、李宗仁等的关系。据叶笃义揭露，1947年11月蒋介石已宣布民盟为非法团体，当时叶笃义等到南京找罗隆基商量对付办法。罗隆基不但把他们的会见安排在美国大使馆内，还要司徒雷登数次“列席指导”他们的讨论。司徒雷登也就公然提出要民盟“光荣解散”，要他们以个人身份参加政治活动的狂妄主张。1948年，全国学生的反美运动爆发，司徒雷登发表了一个极端狂妄无耻的声明，以“自食其果”来威胁中国学生，引起了全国学生的极大愤怒。罗隆基这位民主人士竟然给司徒雷登写信要叶笃义带到南京，以“为亲者所痛”的姿态为司徒“惋惜”，司徒对这种“友谊方式”——司徒的原话——表示非常感谢。浦熙修揭发，就在罗隆基托吴晗带信给沈钧儒，要保留民盟随时退出联合政府的条件的时候，罗隆基在写信祝贺李宗仁竞选胜利时，竟然说：民盟并没有说过不承认“伪国大”及“伪宪法”的话，只说“保留”而已！浦熙修说，这两个“保留”是有关系的。前一个是“保留”退出联合政府的权利，后一个是“保留”随时参加南京伪政府的权利。据浦熙修揭露，1948年中共发出组织联合政府的“五一号召”后，罗隆基曾派叶笃义到南京积极探询司徒雷登的意见，要司徒雷登支持李宗仁，罗隆基还同雷震商谈，想借易地养病之名，在南京、牯岭或台湾等地进行反共活动，幸经张澜制止而未实现。罗隆基当时对时局的估计认为起码还有五年。事实证明那时罗隆基和章伯钧就有联系。当时，章伯钧在香港要发动川、滇、黔的军事力量和共产党三分天下，而罗隆基也在给浦熙修写的信上说：“你对于时局的过分乐观，以为国民党就要垮了，那是错误的。据港方估计时局还有五年，港方还在发动川、滇、黔三省的军事力量呢！”这所谓港方不是章伯钧又是谁呢！
    在钱端升的交代中，谈到了这样几个问题：1934年春夏之交钱端升去南京看蒋介石，蒋知道罗在天津，就要钱转告罗：只要他安分，还可以去南京做官。罗隆基在昆明时的老婆王右佳是和军统有关的特务。钱端升还揭露罗隆基和美帝国主义的得力走狗缪云台之间的勾结。当时钱端升在云南办“今日评论”，经费就是经过罗隆基向缪云台要的。罗子为揭露罗隆基曾经坚持把反革命分子罗自梅（已被判刑）安置在民盟中央他所主持的宣委会工作。在会上发言的还有华罗庚，他揭发罗隆基怎样拉拢他利用他的一些无耻行为。
    最后史良宣布，为了给罗隆基重新做人的机会，在下次会上仍然要罗隆基交代包括张东荪在内的罗隆基小集团的阴谋活动，同时希望这个反共集团中的其他分子要彻底地详细地揭露这个反共集团的阴谋活动。
