    Pottery Treasures
    ——Introducing Jianshui Fine Pottery from Yunnan
    By our reporter Zhang Jiechun
    The words "pottery treasures" are truly befitting of Yunnan's Jianshui fine pottery. It is hard in texture, beautiful in color, and has many unique advantages: meat dishes steamed in this kind of steam pot yield a clear and delicious broth, and kept in the original pot, the flavor stays fresh and the food doesn't spoil for a long time. Yunnan's famous dishes popular with Chinese and foreigners, such as "Sanqi (Panax notoginseng) stewed chicken," "Cordyceps stewed chicken," and "Clear stewed chicken," are all stewed in Jianshui steam pots. Tea brewed in this kind of fine pottery teapot also has a particularly fragrant taste, and even if kept overnight, the tea is still sweet and delicious. Flowers arranged in this kind of fine pottery vase last especially long. Flowers that last one day in an ordinary vase can last two days in this vase; flowers that last three days in an ordinary vase can last six days in this vase; and if you insert peach blossoms, they can even bear small peaches. This fine pottery is as hard as stone and can resist corrosion from strong acids, so it is also very durable.
    The production process of this pottery is relatively complex, and the technical requirements are high. In terms of raw materials, in addition to the main ingredient, red clay, there are also yellow clay, white clay, blue clay, and purple clay. Yellow clay is hard, white clay is sticky, blue clay produces a good sound, and purple clay is beautiful in color. When the five are properly combined, the fine pottery can be "as hard as iron and stone, sound like gold and jade, and have a color that is ancient and elegant." After the clay is formed into a pottery blank, it is leveled when it is slightly dry and hard, and then calligraphy and paintings are engraved on it and filled with white clay. When firing in the kiln, it must be placed inside coarse pottery to prevent the flames from penetrating. Once out of the kiln, other pottery is considered finished, but this is only a semi-finished product, and the most laborious process – polishing – follows. The fired pottery is first polished with coarse sandstone to remove the outer layer of fire skin, then polished with fine sandstone to remove the fire marks, and finally rubbed with some sesame oil and polished with a bright stone until a person's reflection can be seen. If one is not afraid of the labor, it can be polished for dozens of days, and it will only become more and more beautiful.
    This pottery won an award at the International Exposition before liberation. In 1955 and 1956, it participated in overseas arts and crafts exhibitions twice and won overseas exhibition bonuses both times. Jianshui pottery has only been around for more than four hundred years. At first, only coarse pottery such as teapots were made. More than a hundred years ago, someone started making large opium pipes. In 1849, a skilled pipe maker named Pan Jinhuai began to make utensils from fine pottery. Later, he collaborated with a skilled coarse pottery maker named Zhang Hao to make steam pots, vases, teapots, and other utensils. Then they collaborated with two calligraphers and painters, Wang Mianzhang and Wang Wan, brothers, to further improve the skills of Jianshui fine pottery. After 1918, the Xiang Fengchun brothers continued to produce fine pottery. Now this pottery can be said to be very diverse. In terms of color, in addition to the common bronze, jujube red, and reddish-purple dark black, there are also pure white and elegant white pottery and marble-like colored pottery. In terms of objects, more than forty types have been produced. Xiang Fengchun's skills have reached such a level that he can make whatever style is requested by the person placing the order.
    Before liberation, the production of this pottery was very small. Apart from the Xiang Fengchun family, the other seven families only made some during the rainy season. During the Anti-Japanese War, Kuomintang officers stationed in Yunnan were the main buyers. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, production almost completely stopped because no one wanted it. Production was only restored in 1952. Large-scale development only began after the pottery production cooperative was established in 1956. Now, excluding the one hundred and fifty-six women in the polishing and processing cooperatives, there are thirty-six people specializing in this production (excluding kiln workers), with an annual output of more than 20,000 pieces, which is still in short supply.

    陶中珍品
    ——介绍云南建水的细陶
    本报记者　章皆淳
    “陶中珍品”四个字，云南建水的细陶是当之无愧的。它质地坚硬，色泽美观，还具有许多独特的优点：用这种汽锅蒸出来肉类食物，汤清味美，放在原锅里，可以保持很久的时间不走味、不变坏。云南省备受中外人士欢迎的名菜“三七炖鸡”、“虫草炖鸡”和“清炖鸡”等，就是用建水的汽锅炖的。用这种细陶壶来沏茶，味道也特别清香，保存过夜，茶水还是甘美可口。用这种细陶花瓶插花，可以养得特别久，在普通花瓶中可以保持一天的，它可以保持两天；普通花瓶可以保持三天的，它可以保持六天；要是插上桃花，还能结上小桃。这种细陶质坚如石，能耐强酸的腐蚀，所以也非常耐用。
    这种陶器的制作过程是比较复杂的，技术要求也高。在原料方面，除主料红土外，还有黄土、白土、青土和紫土等。黄土性硬，白土性粘，青土音好，紫土色美，五者配合得宜，细陶就能“坚如铁石、音似金玉、色泽古雅”。在做成陶坯后，俟稍干硬时再经过一道平整的工序，然后再刻上书画，填上白土。在窑中烧时，还要扣在粗陶器内，以免火苗透到。出了窑，在别的陶器就算是完工了，它却还只是半成品，后面还有一道最费工的工序——打磨。烧好的陶器，先用粗砂石把外层火皮磨去，再用细砂石磨清火丝，最后擦上一些香油再用亮光石打磨，一直磨到能照见人影为止，如果不怕费工，再磨上几十天都行，反正是愈磨愈漂亮。
    这种陶器解放前就在万国商品展览会上得过奖，1955年1956年又曾两度参加了出国工艺美术展览，并都得了出国展奖金。建水陶器只有四百多年的历史。起初只做一些茶壶之类的粗陶，一百多年前有人开始做大烟斗，到1849年，有一位名叫潘金怀的制烟斗能手，才开始用细陶做出一些用具。之后他又和一位名叫张好的制粗陶的能手合作，做出汽锅、花瓶、茶壶等等用具。接着他们又和两位书画家——王免璋、王完兄弟合作，把建水细陶的技艺又提高一步。1918年以后，向逢春兄弟继续制作细陶。现在这种陶器已可说是种类繁多了。在色调方面，除常见的古铜的枣红的和若红若紫的暗黑外，还有洁白雅致的白陶和大理石一般的彩陶等。在器物方面也已生产到四十多种。向逢春的技艺已经达到这样的水平：只要订货的人讲出所需要的式样来，他就做得出来。
    在解放前，这种陶器的产量非常少，除向逢春家外，其余的七家都是在雨季才做一些。抗战时期，驻云南的国民党军官是主要的买主。抗战胜利后，因为没人要，几乎全部停止了生产。1952年才恢复生产。1956年陶器生产合作社成立后才大规模地发展起来。现在除打磨加工的一百五十六个社外妇女不算外，有三十六人专门从事这一生产（烧窑的不计在内），年产两万多件，还是供不应求。（附图片）
