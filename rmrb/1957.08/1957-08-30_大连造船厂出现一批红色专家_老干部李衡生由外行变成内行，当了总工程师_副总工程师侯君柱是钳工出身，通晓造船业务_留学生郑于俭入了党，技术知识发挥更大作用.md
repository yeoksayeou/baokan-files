Xinhua News Agency, Lushun-Dalian, August 29th. New shipbuilding and ship repair technical cadres are rapidly growing and strengthening in the state-owned Dalian Shipyard.

Currently, 96 of the factory's leading technical work section chiefs and deputy section chiefs, workshop directors and deputy workshop directors are of worker origin. Of the nine section chiefs and deputy section chiefs in the two major technical and production sections, seven were promoted from the ranks of workers. Veteran cadre Li Hengsheng is now serving as the chief engineer. He joined the Communist Party in 1938, fought guerrillas, and engaged in land reform, but did not understand technology. After liberation, he entered the factory to study technology and has transformed from a layman to an expert. He manages the factory's technical work skillfully and is often praised by some veteran engineers who studied abroad. Deputy Chief Engineer Hou Junzhu, a fitter by trade, is called a "red expert" and possesses thorough knowledge of shipbuilding and ship repair. Together with others, he researched methods to reduce the amount of work in the dock and on the slipway, shortening the factory's shipbuilding and ship repair cycles. In the past, it took a year to overhaul a freighter; now it only takes ten months. The time to build each ocean-going tugboat has also been shortened by three months compared to the past. Wang Zhifu, who worked as a boilermaker for more than ten years before liberation, is now the director of the boiler workshop. His rich experience in boiler repair has earned him the title of "Boiler King" among the workers. Whenever there are technical difficulties in boiler repair, they all go to him. In addition, a large number of technical cadres of worker origin, such as riveter technician Su Wanxi and ship hull workshop director Yu Houfu, a lathe operator by trade, are also making different contributions on the production front.

Engineering and technical personnel who graduated from colleges and universities and have been reformed are also playing a significant role in production. Among them, 24 have joined the Chinese Communist Party, and another group are activists. For example, Deputy Chief Engineer Zheng Yujian is an intellectual who studied in the United Kingdom. After undergoing ideological reform and joining the Communist Party, his technical knowledge is playing an even greater role. Activist Guo Changrang, who is responsible for supplying the factory with wind, electricity, water, and oxygen, is doing an excellent job.

Before liberation, the Dalian Shipyard's management and technical work were done by Japanese people. After liberation, with the help and training of Soviet experts, batches of Chinese workers have rapidly grown.

　　大连造船厂出现一批红色专家
　　老干部李衡生由外行变成内行，当了总工程师
　　副总工程师侯君柱是钳工出身，通晓造船业务
　　留学生郑于俭入了党，技术知识发挥更大作用
    据新华社旅大29日电　新的造船、修船技术干部，正在国营大连造船厂迅速成长壮大。
    现在，全厂领导技术工作的正副科长、正副车间主任中就有九十六名是工人出身的。技术、生产两大科室，共有正副科长九人，从工人中提拔的就有七人。老干部李衡生，现在担当总工程师的职务。他在1938年参加共产党，打过游击、搞过土地改革，却不懂技术。解放以后，他进工厂钻研技术，已经由外行变成内行，管理全厂的技术工作，十分熟练，常受到一些曾经在国外留过学的老工程师们的赞扬。钳工出身的副总工程师侯君柱，有人称他是“红色专家”，通晓造船、修船业务知识。他和大家一起研究出减少船坞内和船台上工作量的办法使这个工厂缩短了造船、修船的周期。过去中修一艘货轮要一年，现在只需十个月。建造每艘远洋拖轮的时间也比过去缩短了三个月。在解放以前当过十多年锅炉工的王智富，现在担任锅炉车间主任。他丰富的修锅炉经验，工人们称他“锅炉大王”，凡遇修锅炉的技术疑难，都去找他。此外，铆工出身的技师苏万喜、车工出身的船体车间主任于厚福等大批工人出身的技术干部，也都在生产战线上作出不同的贡献。
    这个工厂经过改造的大专学校毕业的工程技术人员，在生产上也起着显著作用。其中已经有二十四名加入中国共产党，另有一批是积极分子。如副总工程师郑于俭，是留学英国的知识分子。经过思想改造参加共产党以后，他的技术知识发挥着更大的作用。积极分子郭长让，负责供应全厂的风、电、水和氧气，工作十分出色。
    大连造船厂解放以前做管理工作和技术工作的都是日本人。解放以后，在苏联专家的帮助和培养下，一批批中国工人迅速成长起来。
