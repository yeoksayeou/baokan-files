Xinhua News Agency, August 28th, Washington dispatch: The United States is actively plotting to deal with Syria with a two-pronged approach of military intimidation and political isolation.

On the evening of August 27, the U.S. Navy Department announced that the Sixth Fleet was carrying out "exercise missions" in the Mediterranean, and refused to give any explanation for the fleet's sudden cancellation of its visit to French ports. However, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in France revealed that the fleet had cancelled its planned visit to France because it had received "new instructions."

The day before, U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Burke had said that the situation in the Middle East was "more critical" than generally expected; in addition to performing exercise missions, the Sixth Fleet could also "undertake any mission assigned to it."

U.S. President Eisenhower studied the situation in Syria with Republican congressional leaders on August 27. Republican Senator Knowland said after the meeting that "a serious situation has emerged" in Syria.

According to the Associated Press, U.S. officials reaffirmed on August 27 that the United States is enlisting Syria's pro-Western neighbors to exert pressure on Syria.

On the same day, the State Department received the Iranian Ambassador to the United States, Amini. It is said that Amini expressed the Iranian government's concern about the situation in Syria and requested that Henderson, the U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State who is plotting an anti-Syrian conspiracy in the Middle East, "visit" Tehran.

According to Beirut sources: U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Henderson arrived in Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, by plane from Ankara, the capital of Turkey, on August 28, and held talks with Lebanese Foreign Minister Malik. He then met with Lebanese Prime Minister Solh.

After Henderson held a series of talks with the King of Jordan, the King of Iraq, and the Turkish Prime Minister in Istanbul, Turkey, on the situation in Syria, he went to Ankara on the 27th to continue talks with Turkish Prime Minister Menderes.

According to Western news agency reports, Henderson discussed the relationship between the Baghdad Pact and Jordan with the Turkish Prime Minister on the 27th, and considered the issue of Jordan's participation in the pact.

News from London said that Baghdad Pact Organization Secretary-General Khalidi began talks with British officials on August 27 on "defense" issues and the situation in Syria. There is also news that Henderson may also make a trip to London.

The "New York Times" pointed out that Syria's pro-Western neighbors, such as Turkey, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon, are "already discussing various methods and measures" to establish a "cordon sanitaire" against Syria.

　　美国加紧策划反叙利亚阴谋
    本报综合报道　据新华社28日讯华盛顿消息：美国正积极阴谋用军事恫吓和政治孤立双管齐下的措施来对付叙利亚。
    8月27日晚上，美国海军部宣布，第六舰队正在地中海执行“练习任务”，它拒绝对舰队突然取消对法国港口的访问作任何解释。但是，美国驻法国大使馆发言人却已透露，舰队所以打消原定访问法国计划，是因为接到了“新的训令”。
    在这前一天，美国海军参谋长伯克曾经说，中东局势比一般预料的“更为危急”；第六舰队除执行演习任务外，还能“担负分配给它的任何任务”。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔27日同共和党国会领袖研究了叙利亚局势。共和党参议员诺兰在会谈后说，叙利亚“出现了严重的情况”。
    据合众社报道，美国官员27日再次证实，美国正拉拢叙利亚的亲西方的邻国来向叙利亚施行压力。
    同一天，国务院接见了伊朗驻美国大使阿米尼。据说，阿米尼表示伊朗政府关心叙利亚局势，要求正在中东策划反叙利亚阴谋的美国副国务卿帮办汉德逊去“访问”德黑兰。
    据贝鲁特消息：美国副国务卿帮办汉德逊28日从土耳其首都安卡拉乘飞机到达黎巴嫩首都贝鲁特，同黎巴嫩外交部长马利克举行会谈。随后又会见黎巴嫩总理索勒哈。
    汉德逊在土耳其的伊斯坦布尔同约旦国王、伊拉克国王以及土耳其总理就叙利亚局势分别进行了一系列的会谈以后，在27日到安卡拉同土耳其总理曼德列斯继续会谈。
    据西方通讯社消息透露，汉德逊27日曾经同土耳其总理讨论了巴格达条约同约旦的关系，并且考虑了约旦参加这个条约的问题。
    从伦敦传出的消息说，巴格达条约组织秘书长哈利迪27日开始跟英国官员会谈“防御”问题和叙利亚局势。还有消息说，汉德逊也可能去伦敦一趟。
      “纽约时报”指出，目前叙利亚的亲西方的邻国，像土耳其、伊拉克、约旦和黎巴嫩，“已在商议各种办法和措施”来建立对付叙利亚的“防疫线”。
