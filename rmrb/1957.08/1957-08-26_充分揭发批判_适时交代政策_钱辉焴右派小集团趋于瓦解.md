    Fully Expose and Criticize, Appropriately Explain Policies:
　　Qian Huiyu's Rightist Clique Tends Towards Dissolution
    (Our Newspaper) The rightist clique headed by Qian Huiyu in the Ministry of Urban Construction, after repeated counterattacks by the masses, has now basically disintegrated.
    Judging from the refutations of the masses and the materials confessed within the rightist clique, these people colluded with each other because of their inherent roots. The rightist Qian Huiyu came from a landlord class family and had deep-rooted exploitative class characteristics. Although she was a member of the Communist Youth League, those familiar with her said she was a female "ruffian." From 1952 to 1954, she studied at Beijing Normal University. It was during this period that she became acquainted with Huang Shaohong through the relationship of the counter-revolutionary Xie Xin. She and Xie frequented Huang Shaohong's residence together. After she started working, she consistently harbored serious dissatisfaction with the Party and the organization. She had great opinions on the housing allocation issue and wrote letters everywhere to complain. She was also very dissatisfied with her grade (Translator Grade 12). She always felt that the social system of New China was incompatible with her thoughts and feelings.
    When Qian Huiyu attacked the Party, in addition to directly conspiring with Wang Songhua and Peng Shi'an, she also had contact with Wang Gongpu, a rightist in the Civil Design Institute. In addition, she also had contact with He Yongzeng, the backstage person of the "Hundred Flowers Society" at Peking University and the secret editor of the reactionary publication "Plaza." This backstage person personally went to her home three times at the beginning of the rectification movement, introduced Tan Tianrong's "philosophical viewpoints," jointly brewed Qian's nine programs, studied Qian's speech at the debate meeting, and brought the "Plaza" magazine compiled by the rightists, encouraged her "struggle" emotions, and solicited "Plaza" funds from Qian.
    The rightist Wang Songhua came from a family of despotic landlords. His father participated in the Kuomintang's anti-communist guerrilla forces and was suppressed by the People's Government during the land reform for his heinous crimes. At the beginning of the rectification movement, harboring the hatred of his father's death, he promoted how "great" and "capable" the rightist Lin Xiling was. Wang Songhua admitted in his self-criticism that Qian Huiyu's "nine points of opinion" were revised by him. He said: "As a rightist who is ideologically reactionary and took advantage of the Party's rectification movement to attack the Party and socialism... I am guilty." Other members of this clique were either individual careerists or had serious bourgeois ideas and were dissatisfied with the Party. After the masses reasoned with them and struggled against them, they felt that they were at a loss for words, expressed repentance and surrendered. Only Qian Huiyu and Peng Shi'an, the two more stubborn rightist backbone elements, made very incomplete explanations and still adhered to their reactionary positions, maintaining a tacit alliance with each other.

### 充分揭发批判　适时交代政策　钱辉焴右派小集团趋于瓦解

    充分揭发批判　适时交代政策
　　钱辉焴右派小集团趋于瓦解
    本报讯　城市建设部以钱辉焴为首的右派小集团，经过群众的多次反击，现在基本上已经瓦解。
    从群众的驳斥和右派小集团内部交代的材料看来，他们这些人所以沆瀣一气是有其内在根源的。右派分子钱辉焴出身于地主阶级的家庭，剥削阶级的劣根性很深，她虽是共青团员，但熟悉她的人说她是女“阿飞”。1952年到1954年她在北京师范大学读书。就是在这期间，她经过反革命分子谢昕的关系结识了黄绍竑。她和谢一起出入黄绍竑的公馆。她参加工作以后，一贯对党、对组织严重不满。她对房子分配问题意见很大，到处写信告状。对自己的等级（翻译十二级）也很不满意。她总觉得新中国的社会制度和她的思想感情格格不入。
    钱辉焴向党进攻的时候，除了直接同王颂华、彭石安一起同谋策划以外，还和民用设计院的右派分子王功溥有联系，另外，和北京大学“百花学社”的幕后人、反动刊物“广场”的秘密编委贺泳增也有联系。这个幕后人在整风开始的时候曾亲自到她家里三次，介绍谭天荣的“哲学观点”，共同酝酿过钱的九条纲领，研究过钱在辩论大会的发言，并且带来过右派分子所编的“广场”杂志，鼓励过她的“斗争”情绪，向钱募集过“广场”基金。
    右派分子王颂华出身于恶霸地主家庭，他的父亲参加过国民党的剿共游击队，因罪大恶极，土改时被人民政府镇压。在整风开始时，他抱着杀父之仇，宣传右派分子林希翎如何“伟大”“能干”。王颂华在自我检讨中承认钱辉焴的“九点意见”是经他修改的。他说：“我作为一个思想反动，借党整风之机向党向社会主义进攻的右派分子……是有罪的。”这个小集团的其他成员，有的是个人野心分子，有的是有严重的资产阶级思想，对党不满分子。在群众向他们进行说理斗争之后，感到理屈词穷，表示悔过投降。只有钱辉焴和彭石安两个比较顽固的右派骨干分子交代很不彻底，仍然坚持反动立场，互相保持一种默契的同盟关系。
