We Demand Disarmament and Oppose Atomic War
The Three Documents of the Tokyo Conference Express the Wishes of People Worldwide

    **Tokyo Declaration**

    The Third World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament was convened in Tokyo from August 6 to 16, 1957. The conference was attended by 3,981 Japanese delegates and 97 delegates from 25 countries and 10 international organizations in Asia, Africa, Europe, the Americas, and Oceania. Their common purpose in attending the conference was to end all preparations for atomic war. Although we differ in social systems, ideological beliefs, and religious faiths, we have reached a consensus on the following points through earnest discussions at the conference. We believe that nuclear tests are a dangerous manifestation of preparations for nuclear war, and therefore demand that the governments concerned conclude an international agreement to immediately and unconditionally prohibit nuclear tests. We demand the prohibition of the manufacture, stockpiling, and use of nuclear weapons under international supervision. We oppose nuclear-weapon states from transporting nuclear weapons into any other country. We demand universal disarmament under the supervision accepted by all relevant countries. If it is not currently possible to conclude a universal and comprehensive disarmament agreement, we demand the conclusion a partial disarmament agreement. We oppose the establishment and expansion of military bases, especially nuclear bases.

    	 We recognise, at the same time that cancelling all military blocs, cancelling all military bases, and withdrawing all troops from all foreign territories would reduce the threat of nuclear war. Solving these problems will help ease tensions and improve the international situation. This will also help to restore or achieve national independence. For us, it is extremely important to take immediate and effective action to achieve our goals. We are determined to do everything in our power to encourage unified national action within our respective countries, and to encourage unified international action. The targets of our actions especially need to be directed to the United Nations General Assembly. We demand that this body fulfill its important responsibilities to the people of all countries without further delay in prohibiting atomic tests, nuclear weapons, and disarmament. We are convinced that guaranteeing no war and being free from the proven dangers of all test radioactive particles is the greatest desire of the people of all countries in the world. Such a prospect will be a great comfort to the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the first victims of the atomic bomb, and also to the victims of the Bikini Island hydrogen bomb test. We are against nuclear tests and nuclear weapons, and the ultimate goal of disarmament is to declare war itself illegal. We issue this declaration in the name of the Third World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament.

    **Appeal to the United Nations and the Governments of All Countries in the World**

    The people of all countries in the world are eager to ease international tensions, reduce armaments, and prohibit atomic and hydrogen bombs. To meet the wishes of the people of all countries, stopping the testing of atomic and hydrogen bombs is the most important task at present. Conducting such bomb tests is currently making the nuclear arms race even more intense. Many authoritative scientists have warned that these tests increase the dangers of radioactive fallout. The Third World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament was held in Tokyo, the capital of Japan, a country that has suffered three times from the scourge of atomic bombs. The conference was attended by representatives from all continents of the world, including representatives of the atomic bomb victims in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The meeting issued an appeal to the United Nations and the governments of all countries in the world:

    We demand that the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union immediately and unconditionally conclude an agreement on the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bombs. We demand that the United Nations do everything possible to facilitate the conclusion of such an agreement. We further demand that the governments of all countries in the world make every effort to conclude such an agreement. We believe that a system of limiting and registering tests does not meet our requirements. We also believe that this agreement on the prohibition of nuclear tests should not be conditioned on disarmament or any other political issues. The conclusion of this agreement will pave the way for the realization of universal disarmament, including the prohibition of the manufacture, use, and storage of atomic and hydrogen bombs. On behalf of the people of all countries in the world who hope for world peace and the prosperity of all mankind, we ask the United Nations and the governments of all countries in the world to listen to our appeal.

    **Recommendations on Joint Action to Prohibit Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and Strive for Disarmament**

    We, representatives from all continents, together with nearly four thousand Japanese representatives, met in Tokyo from August 6 to 16, 1957. We firmly believe that the immediate and unconditional prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bombs is absolutely necessary. With a sense of urgency, we recommend that the following activities are extremely important to achieve this goal:

    I.	Take joint action on this year's United Nations General Assembly. The United Nations General Assembly, scheduled to open on September 17, 1957, is extremely important for the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bomb tests. In order to influence the Assembly and to enable the countries concerned to reach an agreement on the immediate and unconditional prohibition of nuclear tests, we recommend the following actions:

    (A)	Organize various activities on one or several days in October and November, demanding that an agreement be concluded on the immediate and unconditional prohibition of nuclear tests on that or those days.
    (B)	Take such action directly or through national governments to the United Nations.
    (C)	This action can take various forms according to the specific conditions of each country, region, or locality, and should be organized to mobilize the broadest public opinion.

    II.	Take joint action on the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee. It is recommended that the same joint action be taken to demand that the five countries participating in the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee (which is currently meeting in London) sign an agreement on the prohibition of nuclear tests and nuclear bombs, as well as comprehensive or partial disarmament.

    III.	Carry out activities on governments of all countries. In accordance with the above specific recommendations made to the United Nations General Assembly and the Disarmament Subcommittee, the people of all countries in the world must vigorously carry out activities on their respective governments in order to implement the resolutions of this conference.

    IV.	Strengthen international joint action of people from all walks of life. In order for us to implement the resolutions of this conference, it is absolutely necessary for us to launch a movement in every country to strengthen the international joint action of people from all walks of life.

    These are: (A) The results of scientific research on the harm caused by radioactivity and on the peaceful use of atomic energy should be freely exchanged on an international scale. We believe that it is extremely necessary to convene an international conference of experts in the nearest possible future. It is appropriate to expand international liaison work in this area.

    (B)	In addition, the work of exchanging information between scientists and other intellectuals should be developed.
    (C)	Religious figures, youth, women, students, workers, fishermen, and farmers, etc., must develop international joint action through their respective organizations and personal contacts to strengthen the movement against atomic and hydrogen bombs.
    (D)	Local authorities should be urged to exert influence on the governments of all countries.

    V.	Strengthen cooperation between countries in the Asia-Africa and Pacific regions.

    (A)	In view of the fact that recent nuclear tests and the import of nuclear weapons from foreign countries are mainly continuing in Asia and the Pacific region, it is very important to strengthen the unity between countries, especially in this region. It is equally important to promote cooperation in this region in various movements against the atomic war preparations currently underway on military bases in Okinawa, Korea, and other places. This cooperation should be strengthened in accordance with items I and II.

    (B)	We believe that it is necessary to convene the Second Asia-Africa Conference as soon as possible to promote these goals.

    VI.	Carry out activities to relieve the victims of nuclear bombs. It is hoped that a wider international understanding of the catastrophic consequences of the use and testing of nuclear bombs will be promoted, and that work to relieve victims will be strengthened.

    我们要求裁军反对原子战争
    东京大会的三项文件表达了全世界人民的愿望
    东京宣言
    第三届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会从1957年8月6日至16日在东京举行。参加大会的有三千九百八十一名日本代表，以及来自亚洲、非洲、欧洲、美洲和大洋洲的二十五个国家和十个国际组织的九十七名代表。他们参加大会的共同目的是终止一切原子核战争的准备工作。虽然我们在社会制度、意识形态的信念和宗教信仰上各不相同，但是由于在大会上进行了认真的讨论，我们在下列各点上取得了一致的意见。我们认为原子核试验是准备原子核战争的危险表现，因此要求有关各国政府缔结一项立即无条件禁止原子核试验的国际协定。我们要求在国际监督下禁止制造、储存和使用核武器。我们反对拥有核武器的国家把核武器运入任何别的国家。我们要求在各有关国家接受的监督之下普遍裁军。如果目前还没有可能缔结普遍、全面裁军的协定，我们要求缔结一项局部裁军协定。我们反对建立和扩大军事基地，特别是原子核基地。
    我们认识到，同时取消一切军事集团、取消一切军事基地和从所有外国领土上撤退一切军队，将会减少原子核战争的威胁。解决这些问题将有助于缓和紧张局势和改善国际局势。这也有助于恢复或达到民族独立。对我们说来，立即采取有效的行动来实现我们的目的，是极为重要的。我们决心尽我们的一切力量鼓励在我们各自国家内采取全国的统一行动，并且鼓励采取国际的统一行动。我们的行动的目标尤其需要指向联合国大会。我们要求这个机构毫不再拖延地履行它对各国人民所负的禁止原子核试验爆炸、禁止核武器和裁军的重要职责。我们确信，保证没有战争和免受一切试验的放射微粒的被证明了的危险，这种前途是世界各国人民最大的愿望。这样一个前途的前景将使原子弹的第一批受害者广岛和长崎人民感到莫大的慰借，也将使比基尼岛氢弹试验的受害者感到莫大的慰借。我们反对原子核试验与核武器和争取裁军的最终目的是宣布战争本身为非法。我们以第三届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会的名义发表这个宣言。
                      第三届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会
                                          1957年8月16日于东京
    向联合国和全世界各国政府的呼吁书
    全世界各国人民都渴望缓和国际紧张局势、裁减军备并且禁止原子弹和氢弹。为了满足各国人民的愿望，停止试验原子弹和氢弹是目前首要的任务。进行这种炸弹的试验目前正在使核武器竞赛更加紧张起来。许多权威的科学家都已经提出警告说，这种试验增加了放射产生的危险。第三届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会在曾经三次遭受原子炸弹的祸害的国家日本的首都东京举行，参加大会的有来自全世界各大洲的代表，其中包括广岛和长崎两地原子弹受害者的代表。会议向联合国和全世界各国政府发出呼吁：
    我们要求美国、英国和苏联立即无条件地就禁止原子弹和氢弹问题缔结协定。我们要求联合国尽一切力量促使缔结这样的协定。我们进一步要求全世界各国政府尽力缔结这样的协定。我们认为，限制和登记试验的制度，并不能满足我们的要求。我们还认为，这种关于禁止原子核试验的协定，不应该以裁军或者其他任何政治问题为条件。这种协定的缔结将会铺平道路，便于实现普遍的裁军，包括禁止制造、使用和贮存原子弹和氢弹在内。我们代表希望世界和平和全人类繁荣的全世界各国人民要求联合国和全世界各国政府倾听我们的呼吁。
                      第三届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会
                                          1957年8月16日于东京
    关于为了禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军采取共同行动的建议
    我们来自所有各洲的代表们和将近四千位日本代表一起，于1957年8月6日到16日在东京举行会议。我们坚决认为，立即无条件地禁止原子弹和氢弹是绝对必要的。我们怀着迫切的心情建议，为了实现这个目标，下面这些活动是极为重要的：
    一，对今年的联合国大会采取联合行动。定于1957年9月17日开会的联合国大会对禁止试验原子弹和氢弹是极为重要的。为了对大会施加影响，为了使有关国家就立即无条件地禁止核试验问题达成协议，我们建议采取下列行动：
    （甲）规定在10月和11月中的某一天或者几天里，组织各种活动，在那一天或者那几天里，要求就立即无条件地禁止核试验问题缔结一项协定。
    （乙）直接地或者通过各国政府来对联合国采取这种行动。
    （丙）这种行动可以根据各个国家、地区或者地方的具体条件采取各种形式，并且要组织得能够动员最广泛的舆论。
    二，对联合国裁军小组委员会采取联合行动。建议采取同样的共同行动来要求参加联合国裁军小组委员会（这个委员会现在正在伦敦举行会议）的五个国家就禁止核试验和原子核弹以及全面或局部裁军签订一项协议。
    三，对各国政府进行活动。按照向联合国大会和裁军小组委员会提出的上述具体建议，世界各国人民必须对他们各自政府大力展开活动，以便实现这个会议的决议。
    四，加强各阶层人民的国际共同行动。为了使我们能执行这个会议的决议，我们绝对有必要在每个国家展开运动，以便加强各阶层人民的国际共同行动。
    这些是：（甲）应当在国际规模上自由地交流关于放射性造成的损害和关于和平使用原子能的科学研究的结果。我们认为，在尽可能最近的将来召开一个专家国际会议，是极为必要的。扩大在这方面的国际联络工作，是适宜的。
    （乙）此外，应当发展科学家之间以及其它知识分子之间交换情报的工作。
    （丙）宗教界人士、青年、妇女、学生、工人、渔民和农民等，必须通过他们各自的组织以及个人的接触来发展国际的共同行动，以加强反对原子弹和氢弹的运动。
    （丁）应当敦促地方当局对各国政府施加影响。
    五，加强亚非和太平洋地区国家之间的合作。
    （甲）鉴于最近的核试验和自国外运进核武器主要是在亚洲和太平洋地区继续进行的事实，加强各国，特别是这一地区各国之间的团结是非常重要的。促使这个地区在反对目前正在冲绳岛、朝鲜和其它地方的军事基地上进行的原子战争准备工作的各种运动方面进行合作，也是同样重要的。应当按照第一项和第二项来加强这种合作。
    （乙）我们认为有必要为了促进这些目的而尽速召开第二次亚非会议。
    六，进行救济原子核弹受害者的活动。希望在国际上更加广泛地使人们了解使用和试验原子核弹的灾难性后果，并且加强救济受害者的工作。
