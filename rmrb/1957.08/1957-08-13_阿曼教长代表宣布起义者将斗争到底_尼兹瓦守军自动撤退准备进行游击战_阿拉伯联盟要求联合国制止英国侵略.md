Xinhua News Agency dispatch: According to a Xinhua News Agency report: The representative of the Imam of Oman in Cairo, Harsai, said on the 12th that the Omani insurgents will continue their struggle until final victory.

Referring to the news of the British troops occupying Nizwa, he said that the insurgents had voluntarily withdrawn from strategic strongholds that were geographically vulnerable to British military attacks. He said that the insurgents did not fight in Nizwa, and they had retreated to the outskirts of the capital and the Akhdar Mountains.

Harsai said, "We have decided to regroup our forces, organize guerrillas, and persist in the struggle. Britain will pay a heavy price for its aggression."

According to a Manama dispatch: British attacking forces occupied the Omani capital, Nizwa, on the 11th. Another force advanced to Mauz, northeast of Nizwa, on the evening of the 11th, which is ten miles from Izki.

Omani insurgents are retreating to high mountains full of caves. These high mountains stretch to the edge of the Nizwa oasis, where it is difficult for the British Air Force to function. British armed forces personnel are very worried that the insurgents will form guerrilla units. The British Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Burrows, and the Commander of British Forces in the Arabian Peninsula, Air Vice-Marshal Sinclair, flew from Bahrain to Muscat today to discuss the next steps in attacking the Omani insurgents with Brigadier Robertson, who is in command of the frontline troops, and the Sultan of Muscat.

The Political Committee of the Arab League unanimously adopted a resolution on the 12th, requesting the United Nations Security Council to convene an emergency meeting to discuss the British aggression against Oman.

The resolution adopted by the Political Committee of the League stated: "Member states should take collective action to request the United Nations Security Council to convene an emergency meeting to discuss this issue and to stop the British armed intervention in Oman, as this threatens peace and security in the Middle East and undermines international law and the Charter of the United Nations."

Senior officials of the Arab League said on the 11th that even if British troops occupy the Omani capital, Nizwa, it will not affect the Arab League's attitude towards the Omani issue.

    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：阿曼教长驻开罗代表哈尔塞12日说，阿曼起义者将继续进行斗争，直到取得最后胜利为止。
    他在谈到英国军队占领尼兹瓦的消息时说，起义者自动撤出了那些在地理上易于受英国军事进攻所打击的战略据点。他说，起义者没有在尼兹瓦进行战斗，他们已经撤退到首都的外围和阿赫达尔山中。
    哈尔塞说，我们决定重新集结军队，组织游击队，坚持斗争。英国将为它的侵略付出重大代价。
    据马纳马消息：英国进攻部队在11日占领了阿曼首都尼兹瓦。另一支部队11日晚间推进到了尼兹瓦东北方的马乌兹，这个地方离伊兹基十英里。
    阿曼起义者正在撤退到满是山洞的高山里去。这些高山一直延伸到尼兹瓦绿洲的边缘，英国空军在这些深山里很难发挥作用。英国武装部队人士很担心起义者将组成游击部队。英国驻波斯湾国家政治专员伯罗斯和阿拉伯半岛英军司令辛克莱空军少将今天从巴林飞往马斯喀特，同指挥前线军队的罗伯逊准将和马斯喀特苏丹会商进攻阿曼起义者的下一个步骤。
    阿拉伯联盟政治委员会12日一致通过决定，要求联合国安全理事会召开紧急会议来讨论英国侵略阿曼的问题。
    联盟政治委员会通过的决议说：“会员国应当采取集体行动，要求联合国安全理事会召开紧急会议来讨论这个问题，并且制止英国对阿曼的武装干涉，因为这威胁了中东的和平和安全，破坏了国际法和联合国宪章。”
    阿拉伯联盟的高级官员11日说，即使英国军队占领了阿曼首都尼兹瓦，也不会影响阿拉伯联盟对阿曼问题的态度。
