Xinhua News Agency, August 20th -- In recent months, officers' families in the troops have organized themselves in batches to participate in labor production.

　　Some have established family sewing groups and family laundry groups to sew and wash clothes for officers and soldiers, charging low fees and doing careful work, which has been praised by officers and soldiers. The families of a certain unit stationed in the Jinan area helped soldiers wash 1,600 quilts and blankets, wash and mend 2,000 pieces of clothing, and mend 60 pairs of socks. Eighteen family members of a certain regiment also helped the troops mill more than 18,000 catties of rice. They were all praised at the family representative meeting held by the leadership organs of the troops.

　　Some officers' families have also joined agricultural production cooperatives near the troops' garrisons.
