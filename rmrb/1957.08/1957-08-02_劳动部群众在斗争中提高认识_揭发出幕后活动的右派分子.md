    (Our Dispatch) In the anti-Rightist struggle, the Ministry of Labor's masses exposed the rightist element Diao Jinbo, who was engaged in behind-the-scenes activities.
     When the rectification movement began, Diao embellished the big-character posters written by the masses, deliberately adding many inflammatory titles and carrying out personal attacks. He praised Ge Peiqi and Lin Xiling as "brave." He advocated "Western democracy in politics." He maliciously attacked the Party, saying: "The Party itself has factionalism," and slandered the leading cadres of the Party as "cunning, incompetent, and relying on seniority to eat," without "emotion." He also provoked relations between the Party and the democratic parties and the Communist Youth League, saying: "Democratic parties are son parties," "The Communist Youth League is the same as the Sanminzhuyi Youth League, like the Kitchen God, specializing in making secret reports."
    Before exposing Diao Jinbo, the Ministry of Labor also exposed and refuted the words and deeds of other rightist elements.
    Now the rightist elements in the Ministry of Labor have been isolated, and the broad masses have improved their ability to distinguish right from wrong. Originally, some people only thought that the rightist elements were "individualistic," had "one-sided ways of thinking," were "emotionally extreme," and "harmed the meaning with words." Now they have begun to draw a clear line of demarcation and actively participate in the struggle.

    劳动部群众在斗争中提高认识
    揭发出幕后活动的右派分子
    本报讯　劳动部在反右派斗争中揭发出幕后活动的右派分子刁劲波。
     整风运动开始，刁在群众写的大字报上加油添醋，故意加上许多煽动性标题，进行人身攻击。他称赞葛佩琦和林希翎“勇敢”。他主张“政治上实行西方民主”。他恶意攻击党说：“党本身就有宗派主义”，污蔑党的领导干部都是“狡猾、无能、靠资格吃饭”没有“感情”的人。他还挑拨党同民主党派和共青团的关系，说：“民主党派是儿子党”，“共青团和三青团一样，像灶王爷一样专打小报告”。
    劳动部在揭发刁劲波之前，还揭发驳斥了其他一些右派分子的言行。
    现在劳动部的右派分子已经孤立起来，广大群众提高了辨别是非的能力。原来有些人只认为右派分子是“个人主义”“思想方法片面”“情绪偏激”“以词害意”，现在他们开始划清界限，积极投入斗争。
