 本报旅大29日电　文天申报道: This article was reported by Wen Tianshen from Lüda on the 29th of this month:

　　The Dalian Chemical Plant, which supplies chemical fertilizers to farmland, had successfully completed more than 105% of the basic construction tasks of the First Five-Year Plan by August 15. By this point, the factory's annual chemical fertilizer production (calculated at 5 kilograms of fertilizer per mu) could supply 77 million mu of farmland, potentially increasing grain production by 1.1 billion jin. The factory director told reporters that the Dalian Chemical Plant has been back in production for less than seven years, and the annual production of chemical fertilizers has increased by 70% compared with 1938, the highest production year during the enemy and puppet regime's rule.

　　Before the First Five-Year Plan, this factory used a lot of expensive sulfuric acid to produce chemical fertilizers (calcium sulfate). Meanwhile, the nearby Dalian Alkali Plant discharged limestone containing large amounts of chloride ions (which could be used to produce calcium chloride chemical fertilizer) into the sea as "waste" during the Solvay process for making alkali. Since 1953, the Dalian Chemical Plant has successfully researched and utilized the alkali plant's limestone to produce calcium chloride. This not only saved sulfuric acid, but also reduced the cost of chemical fertilizers by more than 25% compared to the past.

　　With the help of Soviet experts, the Dalian Chemical Plant designed and manufactured many chemical engineering equipment itself. The modern equipment that has been put into production in the past two years includes a 2,400-horsepower high-pressure nitrogen compressor, which is indispensable for manufacturing nitrogen fertilizers, and whose daily throughput of chemical gas is enough to produce 500 tons of ammonium sulfate; highly precise air separation equipment and hydrogen separation equipment that can operate at minus 200 degrees Celsius. There is also China's largest 900-horsepower high-pressure circulating compressor dedicated to the semi-finished product (synthetic ammonia) of chemical fertilizers. The successful manufacture of this equipment has opened up broad prospects for further increasing the production of chemical fertilizers. At present, the factory has reached international levels in terms of gasification rate and the purity of cryogenic washing of carbon monoxide.

　　Due to the improvement of the Dalian Chemical Plant's technology and management level, the state requires them to successively transfer and train complete sets of cadres and technicians for two other chemical factories in the first two years of the Second Five-Year Plan. At present, the factory is continuing to expand and is planning to merge with the Dalian Alkali Plant. This will allow for the comprehensive utilization of salt to produce more chemical fertilizers and alkali. The workers are full of confidence that they will double the production of chemical fertilizers compared to the present in the Second Five-Year Plan.

　　为增产化学肥料开辟远大前景
    大连化学厂制成许多化工设备并继续扩建
    本报旅大29日电　文天申报道：供应农田化学肥料的工厂——大连化学厂，到8月15日止，已顺利完成了第一个五年计划基本建设任务的105％以上。至此，这个工厂每年化学肥料的生产量（如果以每亩施用五公斤化肥计算）可供七千七百万亩农田之用，约可增产粮食十一亿斤。这个工厂的厂长告诉记者说：大连化学厂恢复生产还不到七年，化学肥料的年产量已比敌伪统治时期生产量最高年份的1938年增加了70％。
    在第一个五年计划以前，这个工厂生产化学肥料（硫酸?），要使用许多贵重的硫酸，而邻近的大连碱厂在用苏尔维法造碱中，又把含有大量氯根的石灰石（可利用来生产化学肥料氯化?）当作“废料”排入海中。1953年以来，大连化学厂研究利用碱厂的石灰石生产氯化?成功。这样不仅节约了硫酸，化学肥料的成本也比过去降低了25％以上。
    在苏联专家帮助下，大连化学厂自己设计和制造了许多化工设备。近两年来已投入生产的现代化设备，有制造氮素肥料不可缺少的二千四百马力的高压氮气压缩机，它每昼夜吞吐的化学气体，足够用来制成五百吨硫?；有十分精密的可在摄氏零下200度操作的空气分离设备、氢气分离设备。还有我国目前最大的九百马力专制化学肥料半成品（合成?）的高压循环压缩机等。这些设备制造成功以后，为进一步增产化学肥料开辟了远大前景。目前，这个工厂在造气率和冷冻洗涤一氧化碳的纯度方面，都已达到国际水平。
    由于大连化学厂技术和管理水平的提高，国家要求他们在第二个五年计划的前两年，陆续为其他两个化学工厂输送和培养成套的干部和技术工人。目前这个工厂还在继续扩建，并筹划和大连碱厂合并。这样就可以综合利用食盐，生产更多的化学肥料和碱。工人们信心百倍地要在第二个五年计划中，把化学肥料的产量比现在再提高一倍。
