World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs

    The Third World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament opened in Tokyo on the 6th.

    This world conference, formerly known as the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, was initially launched by the National Convention of the Japanese People Demanding the Prohibition of Atomic and Hydrogen Weapons held in Tokyo on January 16, 1955. The National Convention passed a resolution to initiate a worldwide gathering on August 6, 1955, the tenth anniversary of the United States' first atomic bomb being dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, with the aim of consolidating the movement against atomic and hydrogen weapons and eliminating war.

    This resolution was welcomed and supported by peace-loving people all over the world. The Asian Countries Conference held in April 1955 and the World Peace Conference held in June 1955 both passed resolutions calling on the people of Asia and the world to participate in this movement. The World Peace Council published an appeal on August 2 of the same year, calling on people to "turn August 6, 1955, into a great international day of struggle! Form a strong force to demand disarmament and the destruction of atomic weapons!"

    Holding the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs in Japan is of particular significance. Japan is the first, and only, country to have suffered three times from the disaster of atomic and hydrogen weapons. The Japanese people, who have suffered greatly, resolutely demand the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons. More than 40 million Japanese people have already participated in the signature campaign against atomic and hydrogen weapons.

    The First World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs opened on time with the enthusiastic preparation of the Japanese people and the support of people all over the world. It was held in Hiroshima from August 6 to 8, 1955. Participants included representatives from 14 countries, including China, the Soviet Union, the United States, France, Italy, India, Indonesia, North Korea, Poland, Chile, and Australia, as well as international organizations such as the World Peace Council and the World Federation of Democratic Youth, and representatives from all over Japan, totaling approximately 3,000 people. From August 9 to 14 of that year, mass peace rallies were also held in Nagasaki, Osaka, Kamakura Beach, and other places. On August 15, the conference held a final meeting in Tokyo with more than 20,000 people participating, ending all activities of the conference. Our country also sent a delegation headed by Liu Ningyi to participate in this conference.

    The final day of the Hiroshima Conference (August 8) passed resolutions and declarations. The resolution called on an international conference including the Soviet Union, China, the United States, Britain, France, and India to be held to ease international tensions and opposed the transport of atomic weapons into Japan. The declaration of the conference called on the people of all countries in the world to further and forcefully advance the movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs until mankind achieves true peace.

    The Second World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs opened in Tokyo on August 6, 1956. From August 9 to 11, the conference moved to Nagasaki, another Japanese city bombed by an atomic bomb. Approximately 3,000 people from 14 countries, including China, the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania, Sweden, Belgium, and Brazil, as well as six international organizations and representatives from all over Japan, participated in this conference. The delegation representing our country to participate in this conference was headed by Xu Guangping.

    The resolutions passed by this conference included: demanding that the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union conclude an agreement banning atomic and hydrogen bomb tests, demanding that countries around the world hold a world conference to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs and reduce armaments, and opposing the rearmament of Japan. Finally, the "Declaration of the Second World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs" was also passed. (Xinhua News Agency)

    禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会
    第三届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会6日在东京开幕了。
    这个世界大会以前称为禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会，它最初是由1955年1月16日在东京举行的日本人民要求禁止原子武器和氢武器全国大会发起召开的。全国大会通过决议，发起在美国第一颗原子弹投在日本广岛的十周年——1955年8月6日，举行世界性集会，目的在于巩固反对原子武器和氢武器的运动和消灭战争。
    这项决议得到全世界爱好和平的人民的欢迎和支持。1955年4月间举行的亚洲国家会议和6月间举行的世界和平大会都通过决议，号召亚洲和世界人民参加这个运动。世界和平理事会在同年8月2日发表号召书，号召“把1955年8月6日变成一个伟大的国际斗争日！结成强大的队伍一致要求裁军和销毁原子武器！”
    禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会在日本举行，是具有特殊意义的。日本是第一个，而且是曾经三次遭到原子武器和氢武器灾害的国家。身受其害的日本人民坚决要求禁止原子武器和氢武器。已经有四千多万日本人民参加了反对原子武器和氢武器的签名运动。
    第一届禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会在日本人民的热心筹备下和全世界人民的支持下准时开幕了。它是1955年8月6日到8日在广岛举行的。参加大会的有中国、苏联、美国、法国、意大利、印度、印度尼西亚、朝鲜、波兰、智利、澳大利亚等十四个国家和世界和平理事会、世界民主青年联盟等国际组织的代表，以及来自日本各地的代表共约三千人。那年8月9日到14日，在长崎、大阪、镰仓海滨等地，也分别举行了群众和平集会。8月15日，大会在东京又举行了一次有两万多人参加的最后会议，结束了大会的全部活动。我国也派出以刘宁一为首的代表团，参加了这次大会。
    广岛大会的最后一天会议（8月8日），通过了决议和宣言。决议中要求举行有苏、中、美、英、法、印参加的国际会议来缓和国际紧张局势，反对把原子武器运进日本。大会的宣言号召全世界各国人民进一步强有力地推进禁止原子弹和氢弹运动，直到人类获得真正的和平为止。
    第二届禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会于1956年8月6日在东京开幕。8月9日到11日，大会移到日本另一个遭到原子弹轰炸的城市长崎举行。来自中国、苏联、美国、英国、法国、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、罗马尼亚、瑞典、比利时、巴西等十四个国家及六个国际组织和日本各地的代表约三千人参加了这次大会。代表我国参加这次大会的是以许广平为首的代表团。
    这次大会通过的决议包括：要求美、英、苏三国缔结禁止原子弹、氢弹试验协定，要求世界各国举行禁止原子弹、氢弹和裁减军备世界大会，反对日本重新武装等。最后还通过了“第二届禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会宣言”。　（新华社）
