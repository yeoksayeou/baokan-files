    Criticizing Localism at All Levels, Widely Publicizing Socialism:
    Anhui Completes Over 90% of Grain Procurement Task
    (Our Newspaper Dispatch) Reporter Yu Feng reports: As of August 11th, Anhui Province had procured over 917 million catties of summer grain, completing over 90% of the state's procurement task. Since late July, party and government organs at all levels in Anhui Province have made grain procurement the central task, criticizing cadres' localism and one-sided mass viewpoint on the grain issue from top to bottom. They also carried out extensive socialist propaganda among the peasants, greatly advancing the grain procurement work. Some counties, districts, townships, and cooperatives that originally repeatedly stated they could not complete the procurement task now say they can complete or have already overfulfilled the task. For example, Fuyang County originally said it could not complete the procurement task of 59.82 million catties, and the procurement progress was very slow. By the end of July, the agricultural tax task had not been completed, and the unified purchase only completed 29.7% of the task. After propaganda and education, by August 10th, it had completed 89.5% of the provincial procurement figures, and the warehousing progress was relatively fast in the province. The propaganda and education work in Bo County was more in-depth, and the daily grain collection volume increased from 100,000 catties to 600,000 catties. The director of the Hongguang Cooperative in Jiaqing Township, Su County, originally reported that not only was there no surplus grain for sale, but also requested a supply of 15,000 catties. Recently, after the township examined the mistake of distributing and retaining too much, not only did he not request a supply, but also sold 92,000 catties of surplus grain. After being educated, some farmers took the initiative to save grain to strive to sell more surplus grain, and some took out hidden and privately divided grain to sell to the state. At present, cadres and farmers throughout the province are working hard to overfulfill the province's procurement task, determined to support national construction and disaster areas with more grain.

    层层批判本位主义　广泛宣传社会主义
    安徽完成征购任务90％以上
    本报讯　记者于风报道：截至11日止，安徽省已征购夏粮九亿一千七百多万斤，完成国家征购任务的90％以上。安徽省自7月下旬起，各地党政机关即把粮食征购工作列为中心任务，自上而下层层批判了干部在粮食问题上存在的本位主义和片面群众观点，并对农民广泛地展开了社会主义大宣传，粮食征购工作因此大大前进了一步。有些县、区、乡、社原来一再表示不能完成征购任务，现在表示能够完成或已超额完成任务。如阜阳县原表示不能完成五千九百八十二万斤的征购任务，征购进度也很缓慢，到7月底公粮任务尚未完成，统购只完成任务的29.7％。经过宣传教育，到8月10日即已完成省征购数字的89.5％，入库进度是全省比较快的。亳县的宣传教育工作较深入，每日收粮数量由十万斤上升到六十万斤。宿县夹清乡红光社社主任原报不但没有余粮出售，还要求供应一万五千斤，最近在乡里检查多分多留的错误后，不但不要求供应，还出卖余粮九万二千斤。农民们经过教育后，有的主动节约粮食争取多卖余粮，有的把隐藏和私分的粮食拿出来卖给国家。目前全省干部和农民正在为超额完成全省的征购任务而努力，决心以更多粮食支援国家建设和灾区。
