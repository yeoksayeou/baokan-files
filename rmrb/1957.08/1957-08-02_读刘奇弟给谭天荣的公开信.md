    Reading Liu Qidi's Open Letter to Tan Tianrong
    Zhong Huai

    Tan Tianrong and Liu Qidi were leading figures of the right-wing faction among students at Peking University, and key figures in the reactionary clique "Hundred Flowers Society." On July 25, Liu Qidi wrote an open letter to Tan Tianrong. His motive for writing this letter is yet to be determined. Fortunately, the original letter is short and is reproduced below:

    You often criticize me for being too subjective and not objectively analyzing problems. Indeed, I used to be like that, but today I am no longer subjectively reckless, while you are not. For example:

    1.  You say that the masses still sympathize with and support you, which is probably not in line with the facts, and the facts make it impossible for me to believe. Otherwise, I cannot understand why the masses hate and oppose your most steadfast comrades and closest friends – even I feel this way.

    2.  You say that victory will come in a year, with a transformation like Poland. But what kind of transformation was Poland? What was it like before the transformation? What exactly was the Workers' Committee about? I don't understand very well, and I believe you don't understand either. And what is the situation in our country now? Workers and peasants not only support the Party but also support the Party's current policies. What kind of transformation are you talking about? Who wants us to transform?

    3.  You say that the world should be managed by talented scholars and beauties. Let's first take a look at the world and ourselves! To be honest, the world is indeed very peaceful, and we are indeed only good at messing things up. Even if we take a step back and assume "the world is not peaceful," if we were to manage it, it would only be worse. If you don't believe me, look back at our organized "Hegel-Engels School," "Hundred Flowers Society," and "Plaza"—which one wasn't a complete mess? Forget it! I think it's better to be humble!

    In just a few hundred words, Tan Tianrong's arrogant face is vividly depicted. He is indeed worthy of being Tan's "closest friend." Of course, this letter also slightly exposes some of the "messy" inside stories of their right-wing clique. Isn't this a portrayal of not only Tan Tianrong and his gang, but also of many right-wing elements and right-wing groups?

    It seems that Liu Qidi cannot be said to have no "self-awareness" at all. However, it is said that after writing this letter, Liu Qidi declared that once his affairs were settled, he would go to an imperialist country. If people are so naive as to think that Liu Qidi has already changed his opposition to socialism and has "turned over a new leaf," they would be completely wrong.

    读刘奇弟给谭天荣的公开信
    锺怀
    谭天荣和刘奇弟是北京大学学生中右派分子的首脑人物，是反动小集团“百花学社”的大头目。7月25日，刘奇弟写了一封公开信给谭天荣。他写这封信的动机何在，可以暂不判断，好在原信不长，照录如下：
    你常批评我太主观，不客观分析问题，的确，我曾经是这样，但是我今天可不再主观蛮干了，而你却不是这样，例如：
    1、你说群众现在还是同情支持你，这恐怕与事实不符，而且事实叫我无法相信，不然我不能理解为什么群众对你的最坚定的同道者和最亲近的朋友——我都这样的憎恨和反对。
    2、你说一年之后就会胜利，像波兰一样地变革，但波兰究竟是怎样的变革的，变革之前又是怎样，工人委员会到底怎么回事？我是不甚了解，我深信你也不会了解。而如今我国的情况呢！工人农民不但拥护党而且拥护党现行的政策，来什么变革？谁要我们变革？
    3、你说天下要让我们才子佳人来管，我们首先看看天下和我们吧！老实说，天下确实很太平，而我们确实只会拆烂污，即使退一万步“天下不太平”，若让我们来管，那只会更加糟糕，不信的话，回顾我们组织的“黑格尔恩格斯学派”、“百花社”、“广场”，那一个不是乌七八糟。算了吧！我看还是虚心点好！
    寥寥四百字，就活生生地勾出了谭天荣的狂妄的一副嘴脸。其不愧是谭的“最亲近的朋友”。当然，这封信也稍稍拆穿了一点他们这个右派小集团“乌七八糟”的内幕。这岂仅是谭天荣及其一伙人的写照，难道不是许多右派分子、许多右派集团的写照？
    看来，不能说刘奇弟一点“自知之明”也没有，不过，据说刘奇弟在写了这信之后又宣称，一俟他的事情处理完毕，他就要到帝国主义国家去。人们如果那么天真，以为刘奇弟已经转变了反对社会主义的立场，已经是“革面洗心”，那就大错特错了。
