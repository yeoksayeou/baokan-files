The conductor of a song and dance troupe also plays a rightist role
    (Our newspaper, Tianjin, 31st) The Communist Youth League members of the Tianjin People's Art Theatre Song and Dance Troupe have launched a fierce struggle against the rightists in the troupe. The rightists have begun to bow their heads and confess their crimes. In May, Yan Jiaming, the band conductor and rightist, and Lin Qing, the choir conductor and rightist, took advantage of the Party's rectification movement to attack the Party. They falsely accused the Party branch of being the "incarnation of sectarianism" and the "backstage boss of all bad things." They said, "The leadership of the song and dance troupe has rotted from the head to the root and cannot lead the song and dance troupe; the song and dance troupe should be led by an 'art committee' composed of them, these 'art cadres.'" Several other rightists in the troupe, Li Guang, Yu Zengkai, and Yang Juchuan, falsely accused the Party of the song and dance troupe of "gang rule" and "fascism," saying that the song and dance troupe was a "prison" and a "concentration camp." They denied the achievements of movements such as the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and put forward the slogan of "repaying grievances and avenging hatred." When the rectification began, the Party held mass meetings to solicit opinions. This right-wing clique planned in advance in a secret room "who to attack first, who should fire the first shot, and who should fire later," and stipulated that a climax should be reached at a certain time. However, because the vast majority of Party members in the song and dance troupe patiently educated the masses to distinguish between right and wrong and resolutely struggled against the rightists, the rightists in the song and dance troupe began to collapse. The old musician Yang Yu? spoke at a conference, using his decades of experience to talk about how he was so poor in the old society that he had to sell his musical instruments to exchange for food. Only after liberation did he join the song and dance troupe, and his strength was brought into play, and his life gradually improved. He questioned the rightists Yan Jiaming and Lin Qing, saying, "You two were originally ordinary middle school students. When you first came to the song and dance troupe, you didn't know anything. The head of the troupe taught you by hand, and the Party spent a lot of effort to train you to become conductors. Now you are rebelling against the Party and saying that the Party cannot lead the song and dance troupe. Where is your conscience?" Now, although the rightists of the song and dance troupe have bowed their heads and confessed their guilt to varying degrees, they have not yet made a thorough confession. The troupe members are discussing in groups, preparing to conduct an in-depth and systematic criticism of the reactionary words and deeds of this right-wing clique.

    歌舞团的指挥也有右派角色
    本报天津31日电　天津人民艺术剧院歌舞团的共青团员们，跟团内的右派分子展开激烈斗争，右派分子们已开始低头认罪。5月间，这个歌舞团的乐队指挥、右派分子阎家鸣，合唱队指挥、右派分子林青，利用党整风的机会向党进攻。他们诬蔑党支部是“宗派主义的化身”，是“一切坏事的后台老板”。他们说：“歌舞团的领导已经从头烂到根，不能领导歌舞团；歌舞团要由他们这些‘艺术干部’组成‘艺术委员会’来领导”。团内的另几个右派分子：李光、郁增凯和杨巨川，则诬蔑歌舞团的党是“帮会统治”，是“法西斯”，说歌舞团是“监狱”，是“集中营”；他们否定肃反等运动的成果，提出“有冤报冤，有仇报仇”的口号。整风开始，党召开群众大会征求意见，这个右派小集团事先在密室策划“先攻谁，谁先开炮，谁后开炮”，并规定要在几点钟掀起高潮。但是，由于歌舞团的绝大部分党员，耐心地教育群众分清大是大非，坚决与右派分子进行斗争，歌舞团的右派分子们就开始溃退了，老乐师杨裕?在一次大会上发言，用他几十年的经历，讲他在旧社会穷得曾把乐器卖了换饭吃，只有在解放后参加了歌舞团，他的力量才得到了发挥，生活也逐渐得到改善。他质问右派分子阎家鸣和林青说：“你俩原来都是普通的中学生，才到歌舞团的时候甚么都不知道，团长把着手教你们，党花了很大力量培养你们成为指挥，现在你们却反起党来，还说党不能领导歌舞团，你们的良心到哪里去了？”现在，歌舞团的右派分子们虽然已经分别在不同程度上低头认罪，但都还没有作彻底交代。团员们正在分组讨论，准备对这个右派小集团的反动言行进行深入系统的批判。
