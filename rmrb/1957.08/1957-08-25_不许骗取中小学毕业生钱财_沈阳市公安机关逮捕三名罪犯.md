　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 24th: The Shenyang Public Security Organs recently arrested three criminals, Jin Ke, Jin Youmian, and Li Zhanlin, in accordance with the law, for defrauding large sums of money from primary and secondary school graduates under the guise of running a tutoring school.
　　These three criminals were all individuals who had been dismissed or voluntarily resigned from the Shenyang Smelting Plant. They are currently unemployed. Among them, Jin Ke was dismissed for embezzlement. Seeing the current phenomenon of some middle and primary school graduates not being able to continue their education, they thought there was an opportunity and jointly established a United Cultural Tutoring School. After government investigation, it was deemed that the conditions were not met, and it was not approved. However, the Jin criminals and others posted recruitment advertisements all over the city on August 9th, stating that only tuition fees needed to be paid and no exams would be conducted. They took advantage of the student registration opportunity to widely distribute advertisements. Within a few days, more than 630 primary and secondary school graduates were deceived into registering, and the Jin criminals and others defrauded them of more than 3,100 yuan in tuition fees. Based on the criminal acts of Jin Ke and the other two criminals in spreading rumors and extorting tuition fees, the public security organs, with the approval of the procuratorate, arrested them in accordance with the law.

　  不许骗取中小学毕业生钱财
　　沈阳市公安机关逮捕三名罪犯
    据新华社沈阳24日电　沈阳市公安机关最近依法逮捕了金克、金有绵、李占林等三名用办补习学校的名义骗取中小学毕业生巨款的犯人。
  这三名犯人都是被沈阳冶炼厂开除或者自动离职的分子，目前没有职业。其中金克是因贪污而被开除的。他们见到当前部分中、小学毕业生不能升学的现象，认为有机可乘，就联合举办了一个联合文化补习学校。后经政府调查，认为条件不够，不予批准。而金犯等竟于8月9日将只缴学费、不进行考试的招生广告遍贴全市各处，并利用学生报名机会大肆散发广告，数日内即有六百三十多名中、小学毕业生被骗报了名，金犯等从中骗得学费三千一百多元。公安机关根据金克等三犯招谣撞骗索取学费的犯罪行为，经过检察院批准将他们依法逮捕。
