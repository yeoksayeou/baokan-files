Gunshots in the Misty Night
Ding Xing

　　Night. There was no moon and no stars. The sea was thick with fog, as if it were drizzling.

　　The small island was silent. The soldiers, tired from a day of drills and repairing fortifications, were sound asleep after the lights-out whistle had just blown. The fishermen had also returned home from their boats and closed their doors. Only the soldiers on duty were still vigilantly watching or patrolling. Only the ceaseless seawater was still crashing against the rocks and the beach.

　　Suddenly, from the southern end of the island, "Ba—Ba—Ba—" three gunshots rang out. Immediately afterward, sporadic gunshots also rang out from the west. On the observation post of 196 Height, a bugle was blown loudly.

　　This was the emergency battle alert!

　　The soldiers sleeping at the 148 Height in the front jumped up and grabbed their weapons. Deputy squad leader Shi Ruizhi quietly urged, "Hurry up! Be quiet!" In just two minutes, they had all entered their positions.

　　In the barracks near the village, the soldiers also heard the gunshots and bugle. They quickly put on their clothes, shouldered their weapons, and skillfully carried their ammunition belts, grenades, shovels, canteens, disinfection kits, and raincoats, leaving nothing behind, and rushed to their positions. Even the sick soldier Chen Changji did not stay in the barracks. Running at the front of the first squad was soldier Xu Baogen, carrying a light machine gun. He knew that his position was at the very front, and he had to get there as quickly as possible. Platoon leader Miao Manbao followed closely behind Xu Baogen. Miao Manbao had just returned to the island from the training team this afternoon, and he injured his leg while playing basketball after dinner; but now, he completely forgot the pain in his leg.

　　From the barracks to the front-line position, one had to cross three hilltops. The road was narrow, winding, uneven, and in some places, right on the edge of a cliff. What's more, it was such a dark, foggy night! However, the soldiers were already familiar with this mountain road. They had long been prepared for this kind of sudden combat, so they were still able to run forward at the fastest speed. Only the rustling of footsteps could be heard on the mountainside.

　　If going uphill was difficult, then going downhill was even more difficult. In order to run faster, many soldiers slid down the mountain regardless of the danger. When running down from the first hilltop, soldier Pan Jiaoke stepped on a stone on the side of the road, and slid down with the stone, swelling his left hand. Squad leader Xu Rongsheng, who was behind him, was about to rush to pull him, but Pan Jiaoke had already stood up and continued to rush forward. After entering the trench, Pan Jiaoke tripped over a stone again, spraining his ankle. But he still didn't utter a sound, quickly got up, and ran all the way to his combat position.

　　Near 143 Height, the soldiers of the first squad met Liu Liangliang, a heavy machine gunner from the fourth squad. Liu Liangliang was carrying two boxes of heavy machine gun bullets, as well as his rifle, grenades, and various equipment. At this time, he was already out of breath. He was anxious, but his pace gradually slowed down. Shen Xingwen, a soldier from the first squad, quickly stepped forward and took his rifle, carrying it on his own shoulder. So Liu Liangliang quickened his pace.

　　As soon as the soldiers arrived at their positions, without taking a breath, they loaded their bullets with the same swift movements, repaired the fortifications, and focused all their attention on monitoring the front. Squad leaders whispered to send out messengers to report to the commanders that "combat preparations are complete." At the very front of the first squad's position, Xu Baogen pointed his light machine gun at the bay below the mountain, and said to himself, "If the enemy dares to come up from here, I will resolutely shoot them down."

　　When the infantry soldiers occupied the positions, all combat preparations were also completed on the artillery positions. The first gunner opened the sight and installed the night lighting device. The second gunner opened the breech block. The loader held the shell in both hands. As long as an order was given, the shells could fly towards the ocean in front.

　　Also in these short few minutes, the medical orderly Zhu Yaosheng carried a stretcher, and the cooks carried firewood, rice, oil, and salt, all arriving at 196 Height.

　　The entire island was in a state of combat. But the gunshots did not sound again. After a while, the command post blew the assembly whistle. The soldiers unloaded their bullets and came out of the trenches. They then realized that the gunshots just now were not the discovery of the enemy, but a night combat exercise!

　　When returning from the positions, although the soldiers were all soaked with sweat, they were very excited. Because they had already proven with their actions that even when they were sound asleep, they seemed to have their eyes open, and could go into battle at any time, not allowing the enemy to set foot on the land of the motherland!

    雾夜枪声
    丁星
    夜，没有月亮也没有星星。海上浓雾弥漫，好像下着细雨一般。
    小岛在沉静中，战士们经过一天的操课和修补工事，都疲倦了，熄灯哨子刚刚吹过，就已经睡得很熟。渔民们也从船上回到家里，关上了门。只有值勤的战士，还在警惕地了望或者巡逻。只有永不停息的海水，还在哗哗地冲击岩石和沙滩。
    突然，从海岛的南端，“叭——叭——叭——”地传来三下枪声。紧接着，西边也响起了断断续续的枪声。196高地的观察哨上，立刻呜呜地吹起了小喇叭。
    这是战斗的紧急警报！
    睡在前沿148高地的战士们，一跃起床，提起武器。副班长施瑞芝轻声督促着：“快些！轻些！”只不过两分钟的时间，他们已经全部进入阵地。
    在靠近村庄的营房里，战士们也听到了枪声和喇叭声。他们迅速穿上服装，背起武器，熟练地把子弹带、手榴弹、铁锹、水壶、消毒包和雨布，一件不缺地带在身上，往自己的阵地冲去。就连正在生病的战士陈长基，也没有留在营房里。跑在一班最前面的，是掮着轻机枪的战士徐宝根。他知道自己的阵地在最前沿，必须尽快赶到。排长缪满宝紧紧地跟着徐宝根。缪满宝今天下午刚从集训队回到海岛，晚饭后打篮球又撞伤了腿；但是现在，他完全忘记了腿上的疼痛。
    从营房到前沿阵地，要翻过三个山头。道路很窄，弯弯曲曲，高低不平，有的且在悬崖边上。何况又是这样一片漆黑的雾夜！但是，战士们已经熟悉这条山路，他们早就准备着这种突然投入的战斗，因此仍能以最快的速度跑步前进。山上山下，只听得沙沙的脚步声。
    如果说上山吃力，那么下山更艰难。为了跑得更快一些，许多战士都是不顾危险滑下山去的。从第一个山头往下跑时，战士潘教科一脚踏在路边的一块石头上，连人带石头滑了下去，把左手跌肿了。后面的班长徐荣生正要赶去拉他，潘教科已经站起来，继续往前猛跑。插入堑壕以后，潘教科又被石头绊了一跤，扭伤了脚腕。但是他仍旧哼也没哼一声，迅速起来，一直跑到自己的战斗位置。
    在143高地附近，一班的战士们遇见了四班重机枪手刘良亮。刘良亮背着两箱重机枪子弹，还有步枪、手榴弹和各种装备，这时已经累得喘不过气。他心里着急，步子却渐渐慢了起来。一班战士沈兴文连忙赶上一步，拿过他的步枪，背在自己肩上。于是刘良亮加快了脚步。
    战士们一到阵地，顾不得松一口气，就用同样迅速的动作上子弹，修整工事，全神贯注地监视着前方。班长们低声派出通讯员，去向指挥员报告“战斗准备完毕”。在一班阵地的最前面，徐宝根把轻机枪对准了山下的岙口，心里对自己说：“敌人要是敢从这里上来，我就坚决把他们打下去。”
    当步兵战士们占领阵地的时候，在炮兵阵地上，一切战斗准备也做好了。一炮手打开瞄准镜，装上了夜间照明装置。二炮手打开了护闩套。装填手双手抱起了炮弹。只要一声令下，炮弹就能飞向前面的海洋。
    也是在这短短的几分钟里，卫生员朱耀生扛着担架，炊事员们挑着柴米油盐，一齐到达196高地上。
    整个海岛都在战斗状态中。但是枪声没有再响。不一会，指挥所吹起了集合哨。战士们退下子弹，走出堑壕。他们这才知道，刚才的枪声不是发现敌人，而是一次夜间战斗演习！
    从阵地上回来时，战士们虽然个个汗水湿透了衣服，但是都很兴奋。因为他们已经用行动证明：即使在熟睡的时候，他们也好像睁着眼睛，能够随时投入战斗，不让敌人踏上祖国的土地！
