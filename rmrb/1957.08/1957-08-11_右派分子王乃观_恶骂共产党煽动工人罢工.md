Rightist Wang Naiguan
Viciously Slanders the Communist Party and Incites Workers to Strike

This newspaper reports that the Shanghai Institute of Metallurgy and Ceramics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has recently exposed and criticized the anti-Party, anti-socialist rightist Wang Naiguan.

Wang Naiguan was a technician in the Mechanical and Electrical Engineering Section of the Institute of Metallurgy and Ceramics and a member of the China Democratic League. He took the opportunity of the Communist Party's rectification campaign to publish a series of reactionary remarks, cursing "the Communist Party is a group of shameless zombies," and slandering "the socialist system is the root cause of the three evils, and the most fundamental problem lies in the proletarian dictatorship." He believed that we cannot produce anything of value in scientific research here, while the United States produces many things; this is a problem of "system." He also said, "If the minority is to truly submit to the majority, then the petty bourgeoisie has the largest number of people. Why doesn't the working class submit to the petty bourgeoisie?"

During the rectification campaign, Wang Naiguan took advantage of the fact that some workers in the Institute's workshop had some opinions on welfare funds and housing issues. He seized the opportunity to spread rumors and openly incite the workers, saying: "Some factories outside have already gone on strike. If your problems are not resolved, don't work."

At a forum of the China Democratic League group, Wang Naiguan even waved his arms and shouted loudly, "In the past, the China Democratic League was the Communist Party's concubine. If the Communist Party said one, the China Democratic League could not say two. Now, democratic figures can no longer be pawns; they must be chess players." He also said, "Communism is not working. There are problems on every front in China. Giving priority to the development of heavy industry is a mistake in the political line." Wang Naiguan even said madly, "If a Hungarian incident happens in China, I will definitely take a gun and fight!" After the meeting, he boasted about bourgeois "democracy," and on one occasion even sang the Kuomintang party song in a moment of overconfidence.

After Wang Naiguan's reactionary remarks were exposed, they were severely criticized by all members of the Institute.

    右派分子王乃观
    恶骂共产党煽动工人罢工
    本报讯　中国科学院冶金陶瓷研究所最近揭发和批判反对共产党反对社会主义的右派分子王乃观。
    王乃观是冶金陶瓷研究所机电室技佐、民盟盟员。他利用共产党整风的机会发表了一系列的反动言论，咒骂“共产党是一群无耻的僵尸”，污蔑“社会主义制度就是产生三害的根源，而最根本的问题在于无产阶级专政”；他认为在科学研究上，我们这里搞不出东西，而美国就做出很多东西，这是“制度”问题。又说：“如果要真正的少数服从多数，那么小资产阶级人数最多，为什么工人阶级不去服从小资产阶级？”
    在整风期间，王乃观利用研究所工场有几个工人对福利金和房屋问题有些意见，他就乘机造谣公开煽动工人说：“外面有些工厂已经罢工了，你们的问题不解决，就不要做工”。
    王乃观在民盟小组的座谈会上，更张牙舞爪地大声叫嚷说“过去民盟是共产党的小老婆，共产党说一，民盟就不能说二，现在民主人士不能再当棋子，要做棋手了”。又说“共产主义不行，中国随便哪条战线都有问题，优先发展重工业就是政治路线错误”。王乃观甚至疯狂地说：“如果中国发生匈牙利事件，我一定拿着枪去干！”会后他还大吹资产阶级“民主”，有一次竟得意忘形地唱起国民党党歌。
    王乃观的这些反动言行被揭发后受到了研究所全体人员的严厉批判。（新华社上海专稿）
