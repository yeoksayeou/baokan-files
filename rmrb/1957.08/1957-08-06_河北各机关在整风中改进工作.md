    Hebei provincial organs are improving their work during the rectification campaign
    (By this newspaper) Hebei Province's organs, following the principle of rectifying and improving simultaneously, are both widely soliciting opinions and gradually improving their work.
    After the start of the rectification movement, people from all walks of life raised many opinions regarding the long-standing water conservancy disputes in the five special districts of Hebei Province. The responsible persons of the Hebei Province leading organs immediately went to the areas where the disputes occurred to conduct investigations and research, and basically resolved these disputes through consultation. Regarding the summer grain purchase work, the Hebei Provincial Grain Bureau made improvements based on the opinions of the masses in various regions, and after repeated in-depth investigations and research, revised the standard of grain consumption quotas. In order to correctly handle the problems that occurred in the wheat harvest work, the Judicial Department promptly dispatched two work teams to go deep into the counties and townships to understand the situation and provide guidance. In order to overcome the uneven workload of cadres, the Grain Bureau re-adjusted the use of cadres according to the opinions of the masses and stipulated the scope of responsibilities and authority.
    Regarding the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, all units with outstanding issues or those whose cases were being reviewed organized special personnel or specialized groups to conduct research and processing. In addition, regarding the issues of leading cadres' use of cars and housing and the welfare of general cadres, various organs have put forward preliminary opinions or plans, and are prepared to gradually improve them.

    河北各机关在整风中改进工作
    本报讯　河北省各机关根据边整风边改进的方针，一面广泛征求意见，一面逐步改进工作。
    整风运动开始后，各界人士对河北省五个专区长期存在的水利纠纷问题提出了许多意见，河北省领导机关负责人立即到发生纠纷的地区进行了调查研究，并通过协商办法基本上解决了这些纠纷问题。关于夏季粮食征购工作，河北省粮食厅根据各地区群众的意见作了改进，并经过多次深入调查研究，修改了粮食消费定量标准。司法厅为了正确处理麦收工作中所发生的问题，及时派出两个工作组深入到县、乡了解情况和指导工作。粮食厅为了克服干部忙闲不均的现象，根据群众意见对干部的使用重新作了调整，并规定了职责权限。
    在肃反工作方面，凡有遗留问题或肃反对象提出意见的单位，都抽出专人或组织专门小组来进行研究处理。此外，关于领导干部坐车用房问题和一般干部的生活福利等问题，各机关都提出了初步意见或方案，准备逐步地加以改进。
