	Scientific Research Must Have the Leadership of the Party
	Advancing towards science is a mass movement, encompassing not only individual scientific research but also collective scientific research; for socialist construction, the latter is even more valuable than the former. Collective research requires correct leadership, which is the leadership of the Party. Scientific research that charges ahead blindly is not only useless to the people but may also bring harm to all mankind. Through nuclear physics, people can use the energy stored in the nuclei of uranium, thorium, and other atoms to generate electricity, or they can make atomic bombs to kill people on a large scale. Which path to take and how to utilize it depends on political orientation. To use it for peaceful purposes, there must be the leadership of the Party. Without the Party's leadership in conducting scientific research, it would be like a blind man riding a blind horse, bound to fall into a pit.
	Generally speaking, scientific research without Party leadership is divorced from the interests of the people and loses its direction in the march towards science. Scientific workers will discover some contradictions in their work, reflect individualism and subjectivism, and reflect one-sidedness and limitations in viewpoints and methods; therefore, scientific workers must have the Party's leadership and assistance to resolve contradictions and overcome shortcomings. (Excerpt from Chen Jianguo, "Is Party Leadership Necessary for Scientific Research, and Can the Party Lead Scientific Research?" in the August 21st Jiefang Daily)
	What is the Ideological Root of Right-Wing Elements within the Party?
	Judging from several materials, the ideological reasons are roughly as follows: 1. Revisionist ideology (i.e., the reflection of bourgeois political thought within the Party) and the spontaneous anarchistic tendencies of the petty bourgeoisie. For example, departing from the class viewpoint and favoring so-called "absolute" "democracy" and "freedom"; being very interested in and fond of certain aspects of capitalist political systems and political life, as well as the so-called "new things" of domestic and foreign revisionism. 2. Individualism. Because their status, treatment, and various personal demands were not met, or because they had made mistakes and been criticized or disciplined by the Party, they failed to correctly position the relationship between the individual and the Party, and therefore harbored serious dissatisfaction with the Party, even feeling that the Party was "unwarm," "cold," and "dark." Such people are naturally prone to wavering and even betraying in fierce class struggles. 3. Arrogance and self-importance. Believing that they understand everything because they have learned a little cultural knowledge and bookish Marxism-Leninism, or because they have experienced some things; therefore, they fundamentally do not humbly study Marxism-Leninism or temper and transform themselves in practice, but one-sidedly emphasize "independent thinking" and abstractly talk about "pursuing truth," resulting in "independence" and "pursuit" that stray beyond the standpoint and viewpoints of Marxism-Leninism. 4. Liberalism. Many of these Party members usually only want freedom and not discipline, only individuality and not Party spirit. When the storm comes, they act even more freely, disobeying the leadership of the Party. This can only lead them astray. (Excerpt from Bai Cheng, "Why Do Right-Wingers Appear within the Party?" in the August 19th Beijing Daily)
	We Need Such Experts
	The so-called expert refers to a real expert, not a fake expert, a true intellectual, not a fake intellectual, a complete intellectual, not a half-intellectual. ... It should be recognized that for some intellectuals who already have the ideology and feelings of the working class, there is no distinction between "you" are the expert or "I" am the expert, and everyone is a socialist builder in different positions. In a society with both centralization and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unified will and individual ease of mind and a lively atmosphere, they should contribute their share of energy. As for those intellectuals who are not yet convinced of the Communist Party, they still have a distance of varying lengths between their ideology and feelings and those of the working class, and they still distinguish between "you" and "me." They are not yet accustomed to the new society, and some people are still disturbed at the slightest sign of trouble, feeling uneasy. They may also admire words like "laymen cannot lead experts," but most of them are not irreconcilably opposed to the Communist Party. If they have real talent and practical skills, as long as they love the country, abide by the law, and work honestly, they can still contribute to the socialist motherland. Facts have proven that they are still inclined to accept the socialist road and the leadership of the proletariat to varying degrees. After transformation, they can also become intellectuals who truly stand firm on the working-class position. Only in this way can they truly become experts in all walks of life who build socialism. (Excerpt from Wang Li, "On Socialist Experts," in the August 26th China Youth Daily)

专栏：报刊论文摘要

　　报刊论文摘要
　　科学研究必须有党的领导
    向科学进军，是群众性的，不但包含个人的科学研究，也包含着集体的科学研究；对社会主义建设来说，后者比前者还要贵重。集体研究需要正确的领导，就是党的领导。横冲直撞的科学研究不仅无益于人民，还可能贻害全人类。通过原子核物理学，人们能够利用铀、钍等原子核内所宝藏的能量来发电，也可以作成原子弹来大量地杀人。何去何从，怎样利用，要看政治的倾向，要和平利用，必须要有党的领导。没有党的领导来做科学研究，盲人瞎马，会跌入泥坑。
    总的说来，无党领导的科学研究是脱离人民的利益、迷失向科学进军的路线的。科学工作者在自己的工作中，会发现出一些矛盾，会反映出个人主义和主观主义，会反映出观点和方法上的片面性和局限性；因此科学工作者必须要有党的领导和帮助来统一矛盾，克服缺点。（摘自8月21日解放日报陈建功：“科学研究是否需要党的领导，党能不能够领导科学研究”）
　  党内右派分子的思想根源是什么？
    从若干材料来看，这种思想上的原因大体有以下一些：一、修正主义思想（即资产阶级政治思想在党内的反映）和小资产阶级自发的无政府主义倾向。比如离开阶级观点，喜欢所谓“绝对”的“民主”与“自由”；对资本主义政治制度和政治生活中的一些东西，对国内外修正主义的所谓“新事物”很感兴趣，很合口味。二、个人主义。由于地位、待遇及这样那样的个人要求未能满足，或曾有错误受过党的批评、处分，不能摆正个人与党的关系，因而对党怀有严重的不满情绪，甚至觉得党内“不温暖”、“冷酷”、“黑暗”。这种人在激烈的阶级斗争中自然也就很容易发生动摇以至叛变。三、狂妄自大。以为学了一点文化知识和书本上的马列主义，或是经历了一些事情，就什么都懂了，因此他们根本不虚心钻研马列主义和在实践中锻炼改造自己，却片面强调“独立思考”，抽象地奢谈“追求真理”，结果“独立”、“追求”到马列主义的立场、观点以外去了。四、自由主义。这些党员中有许多平日就只要自由，不要纪律，只要个性，不要党性。风浪来了更是自由行动，不服从党的领导。这就当然只能走入歧途。（摘自8月19日北京日报白诚：“为什么党内会出现右派”）
  　我们需要这样的内行
    所谓内行，是指真内行，不是假内行，是真知识分子，不是假知识分子，是完全的知识分子，不是半知识分子。……应当看到，对于一部分已经具有工人阶级思想感情的知识分子说来，他们和工人阶级已经不分你我，根本也就不产生“你”是内行或是“我”是内行的问题，大家都是不同岗位上的社会主义建设者，在既有集中又有民主，既有纪律又有自由，有既统一意志又有个人心情舒畅、生动活泼的社会里，有一分热，发一分光。至于那些对共产党还不心服的知识分子，他们和工人阶级思想感情还有着或长或短的距离，还分你我，对新社会还不习惯，一有风吹草动，有的人还神魂不安，心里头七上八下，他们对“外行不能领导内行”之类的话可能也很欣赏，但是其中的大多数人并不是和共产党誓不两立，他们如果有真才实学，有一技之长，只要爱国守法，诚实劳动，还是可以为社会主义祖国有所贡献的。事实证明他们还在不同程度上，倾向于接受社会主义道路和无产阶级的领导的，他们在经过改造以后，也可以成为真正站稳工人阶级立场的知识分子，也只有如此，他们才真正成为各行各业的建设社会主义的内行人。（摘自8月26日中国青年报王力：“论社会主义的内行”）
