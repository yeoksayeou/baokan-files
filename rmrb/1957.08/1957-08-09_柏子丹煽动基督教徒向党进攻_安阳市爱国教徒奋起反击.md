	The Henan Daily reported: Christians in Anyang City, the Anyang People's Hospital, and the Anyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference successively held symposiums, exposing and refuting the right-wing element Bai Zidan, who incited Christians to attack the Party and socialism.

	Bai Zidan is the director of surgery at the Anyang People's Hospital. During the period of "Great Blooming and Contending," he groundlessly claimed that the Party and government "despise Christians and always make things difficult for them," and he scolded patriotic Christians as having "insincere faith, practicing 'rice bowl-ism' and 'opportunism,' they appear very active, but one must be careful of them." Bai Zidan also openly incited Christians to oppose the government, saying, "Historically, Christians will not yield to 'violence.'" He used the example of the Roman Emperor Nero killing Christians to imply to the Christians: "Every drop of blood shed by Christians is a seed for the church, and the more the church is killed, the more it will thrive."

	Bai Zidan's incitement not only failed to achieve its purpose but aroused the anger of patriotic Christians and people from all walks of life in Anyang City.

	In an article refuting Bai Zidan's fallacies, Christian Yuan Deshan said: "Bai Zidan said that some Christians, under the pressure of the new situation, dare not admit that they are Christians, and this is 'rice bowl-ism' and 'opportunism.' I think his remarks are fabricated out of thin air, distorting the facts, and are vicious instigation. Who doesn't know that the Constitution clearly stipulates freedom of religious belief? Bai Zidan's purpose in saying this is to slander patriotic Christians and hinder the ideological progress of Christians. After liberation, I participated in work, and the government did not discriminate against me because I am a Christian. I go to church every Sunday, and no one has ever interfered with me. Why is Bai Zidan maliciously spreading rumors?"

	Wu Peiquan, Liang Fu'an, and others said at the symposium: "The government has never forbidden religious belief at any time. Your intention is to provoke Christians, to be dissatisfied with the Party. You want to find a market in the church, gather strength, and attack the Party."

    柏子丹煽动基督教徒向党进攻
    安阳市爱国教徒奋起反击
    本报讯　河南日报报道：安阳市基督教徒、安阳市人民医院、安阳市政协委员会连续召开座谈会，揭露和驳斥煽动教徒向党、向社会主义进攻的右派分子柏子丹。
    柏子丹是安阳市人民医院外科主任。他在大鸣大放期间无中生有地说党和政府“藐视教徒，总要给教徒点过不去”，辱骂爱国教徒“信仰不真，是饭碗主义、机会主义，看着他们很积极，对他们要小心”。柏子丹还公开煽动教徒反对政府，他说：“从历史上看，教徒不会在‘暴力’面前屈服。”并以意大利国王尼肉杀基督教徒的例子暗示教徒说：“基督教徒流一滴血，都是教会的种子，教会越杀越旺。”
    柏子丹的煽动非但没有达到目的，反而引起安阳市爱国教徒和各界人民的愤怒。
    教徒袁德善在一篇驳柏子丹谬论的文章中说：“柏子丹说有的教徒在新形势逼迫下，不敢承认自己是教徒，这是饭碗主义、机会主义。我认为他的这种言论是无中生有，捏造事实，是恶毒的挑拨离间。谁不知道宪法明文规定宗教信仰自由。柏子丹这样说的目的，在于诬蔑爱国教徒，阻碍教徒思想进步。解放后，我参加了工作，政府并没有因为我是教徒而歧视我。我每星期日去做礼拜，从来没有人干涉过我，为什么柏子丹恶意造谣呢？”
    吴培泉、梁福安等人在座谈会上发言说：“政府任何时候也没有不叫信教，你的用意是挑拨教徒，对党不满，你是想在教会中找市场，拉力量，向党进攻。”
