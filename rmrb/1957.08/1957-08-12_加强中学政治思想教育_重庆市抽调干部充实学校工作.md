Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, August 11th: The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has transferred 110 Party and Communist Youth League cadres from various government organs to strengthen political education in ordinary middle schools. Starting from the 9th, they have been participating in the anti-rightist struggle that is currently being carried out among the faculty and staff of senior and junior middle schools throughout the city.

The biggest problem exposed in Chongqing's ordinary middle schools during this rectification movement is the weakness of the Party's political leadership and the poor quality of political and ideological education. Last year, with the exception of the third year of senior high school, all other grades stopped their original political classes due to a lack of suitable teaching materials, etc. Now, the city has decided that from this semester onwards, ordinary middle schools, from the first year of junior high school to the graduating class of senior high school, will offer political classes every semester, with two hours of instruction per week. The cadres who have been transferred this time will serve as political teachers. At the same time, the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has also transferred 27 Party and Communist Youth League cadres from government organs to be responsible for administrative leadership in these ordinary middle schools.

The 137 cadres who have been sent to work in the schools have all been carefully selected by their respective organs. They all have a senior high school or university education and a certain level of theoretical understanding and lecturing ability; these cadres have performed well in the anti-rightist struggle. According to incomplete statistics, 39 of them have received various model titles and commendations or performed meritorious service in their revolutionary work or revolutionary struggles.

    加强中学政治思想教育
    重庆市抽调干部充实学校工作
    据新华社重庆11日电　中共重庆市委员会抽调一百一十名机关党、团员干部，加强普通中学的政治教育工作。9日起，他们分别参加了正在全市高、初中教职员中进行的反右派的斗争。
    在这次整风中，重庆市普通中学暴露出的最大问题是党的政治领导薄弱，政治思想教育工作做得差。去年除高中三年级外，其他年级因缺乏适合的教材等原因，都停止了原有的政治课。现在全市确定从本学期起，普通中学从初中一年级到高中毕业班，每学期都要开设政治课，每周授课两小时，这次被抽调的干部就是去担任政治课的教员。与此同时，中共重庆市委还抽调了二十七名党、团员机关干部，到这些普通中学负责行政领导工作。
    这批派往学校工作的一百三十七名干部，都是经过各机关认真挑选的。他们都具有高中和大学的文化程度，有一定的理论水平和讲述能力；这些干部在反右派斗争中表现良好。据不完全的统计，他们当中有三十九人在革命工作岗位上或革命斗争中，曾经获得各种模范称号和立过功。
