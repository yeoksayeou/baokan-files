Why Do They Have a Grain Surplus?
　　Zhao Jialie

　　There is a factory in Beijing that turned over a total of 50,000 jin of grain saved in 1956 at the beginning of this year. This year, the factory's proposed savings plan was based on the verified quota standards, and as of August 15, it had saved another 33,600 jin of grain.

　　Heavy manual laborers account for 65% of the factory's total workforce, but the average actual monthly grain consumption per person is not only 2.41 jin less than similar factories in the same district, but also 0.57 jin less than the average grain consumption per person in the 354 collective dining units in the district.

　　On the 15th of this month, I came to the factory's kitchen. The cooks were busy pressing noodles from the noodle machine, and the rice and steamed buns in the steamer were piping hot. The meal included five dishes: chicken stewed with winter melon, tomato and egg soup, and stir-fried shredded pork with cabbage. At the entrance of the canteen, a blackboard announced that a total of more than 4,100 jin of grain had been saved in June, exceeding the original savings plan. The claim that "large dining units cannot save" has been shattered here. This factory not only saves grain, but also eats well. Why has this factory achieved such good results in saving grain?

　　Having a Sound System

　　The leading cadres of this factory attach great importance to saving grain. When rectifying grain work at the beginning of this year, they drew several cadres to set up a grain rectification office. At that time, in order to publicize the saving of grain, a general meeting of employees was held throughout the factory. Organizations such as the Party, the Communist Youth League, and the trade union also used specific people and specific events in the factory to carry out publicity and education on saving grain on the canteen and workshop blackboards, and also held an exhibition of grain waste. After that, the factory separately assessed the monthly grain ration for each person.

　　Then, the factory formulated a ten-article canteen management system with the content of "only憑餐證 (ping can zheng - relying on meal tickets), no favoritism, serving good and full meals, and no waste allowed." According to this system, the factory must check population changes every month to verify the population and issue meal tickets according to the number of people. The meal tickets indicate the time of the month, day, morning, noon, and evening meals, and strictly implement "valid for the current meal only, expired tickets are invalid." In this way, the phenomenon of eating without grain ration tickets has been eradicated. Visiting relatives and friends from outside must exchange grain ration tickets for meal tickets in order to eat.

　　Having Mass Supervision

　　Mobilize the masses to supervise the behavior of wasting grain. One day, a worker bought a bowl of noodles but couldn't finish it. He said the taste was bland. After adding salt, he said it was too salty. The cook explained the principle of saving grain to him and offered to dilute the noodles with boiling water, asking him not to waste it. As a result, the worker left in a fit of anger. After this incident occurred, the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch of the workshop immediately talked to the worker, and the blackboard also criticized him. In the end, the person who wasted grain examined his mistake.

　　In order to avoid leftover rice in bowls, the canteen, with everyone's agreement, had everyone deliver their utensils to the kitchen window after finishing their meals. This required carrying the rice bowl past many dining tables, and everyone could see if there was any leftover food, which was embarrassing. As a result, the phenomenon of leftover rice disappeared. In the past, the discarded rice and dishes after each meal would fill six buckets, but now the leftover soup and leftovers together barely fill two buckets. Anyone who secretly leaves leftover food or takes cooked food out of the canteen will be exposed at any time, and his name and food will be displayed together for everyone to see.

　　There is Still Potential for Savings

　　This factory can save 55 jin of grain every day by utilizing pot scrapings, the skin of steamed buns on the steamer, and paying attention to brushing out flour sacks. Recently, they bought some sweet potatoes for breakfast, which saves grain and everyone likes to eat them. The deputy secretary of the factory's Party committee said:

　　"There is still potential to be tapped in saving grain, and a small number of people who do not pay attention to saving need to be strengthened in education. This factory is preparing to increase the monthly savings of 1.5 jin of grain per person to 2 jin, and it seems that this can be done."

　　他们的粮食为什么有节余
　　赵家烈
    北京市有这么一个工厂，在今年年初上缴了1956年所节约的粮食共五万斤。今年这个厂提出的节约计划是按已经核实了的定量标准提出的，截至8月15日，又节约了粮食三万三千六百多斤。
    这个厂的重体力劳动者占全厂职工总数65％，但每人每月平均实际用粮量，不仅比同区同类厂少二点四一斤，而且比全区三百五十四个集体伙食单位的平均每人用粮量少零点五七斤。
    本月15日，我来到这个工厂的厨房，炊事员正忙碌地把面条从压面机里压出来，笼屉里的饭和馍热气腾腾；这一餐有鸡炖冬瓜、西红柿鸡蛋汤、肉片炒白菜等五种菜。食堂门口，黑板报宣布6月份共节约了粮食四千一百多斤，超过原订的节约计划。“大伙食单位没法节约”的说法在这里被粉碎了。这个厂不但节约了粮食，而且吃得并不坏。为什么这个工厂在节约粮食上取得这样好的成绩呢？
      有健全的制度
    这个厂的领导干部对节约粮食比较重视，今年年初整顿粮食工作时曾抽调几个干部设立粮食整顿办公室。当时为宣传节约粮食，全厂开过职工大会，党、团、工会等组织还在食堂和车间黑板报上，用本厂具体人具体事进行节约粮食的宣传教育，还举行过浪费粮食展览会。之后，全厂分别评定了每人每月的粮食定量。
    接着厂里订了一个以“只凭餐证，不讲人情，办好吃饱，不准浪费”为内容的十条食堂管理制度。根据这个制度，工厂每月要检查人口变动以便核实人口，按人发给餐证。餐证上标明月、日、早、中、晚的用餐时间，严格执行“当餐有效，过期作废”。这样，就根绝了无粮票吃饭的现象，外来的亲友要凭粮票兑换餐证才能吃上饭。
    有群众的监督
    发动群众监督浪费粮食的行为。一天，一个工人买了一碗面条吃不完，说味道淡了，给他加盐后又说太咸了，炊事员和他讲节约粮食的道理，并愿意用开水把面条冲淡些，要求他不要浪费掉。这个工人结果赌气走了。这件事发生后，车间团支部书记立刻找这位工人谈了话，黑板报也提出了批评。最后，浪费粮食的人检讨了自己的错误。
      为了避免碗里剩饭，食堂经过大家同意，在吃完饭后，由自己把食具送到厨房窗口，这样要端着饭碗经过许多食桌，剩了饭菜大家都能看见，脸上不光彩。因而剩饭的现象没有了。过去每餐饭后抛撒的饭菜要装满六桶，现在残汤剩菜凑在一起不到两桶。有偷偷剩下饭菜和带熟食出食堂的，随时会被揭发出来，这样他的名字和食物就要摆在一起向大家展览。
    还有节约的潜力
    这个厂由于利用锅粑，蒸笼上的馍皮和注意刷净面袋，每天就能节省粮食五十五斤；最近几天买了一些白薯作早点，既省粮食，大伙还挺爱吃。厂的党委副书记说：
  “节约粮食还有潜力可挖，少数不重视节约的人还需要加强教育。这个工厂正准备把每人每月节约一斤半粮食提高到节约两斤，看来这是可以作到的。”
