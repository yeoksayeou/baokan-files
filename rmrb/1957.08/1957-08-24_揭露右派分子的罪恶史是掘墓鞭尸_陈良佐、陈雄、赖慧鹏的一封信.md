　　Exposing the Criminal History of Rightists is Grave Robbing and Corpse Whipping
　  A Letter from Chen Liangzuo, Chen Xiong, and Lai Huipeng
    On June 22nd, Chen Liangzuo, Chen Xiong, and Lai Huipeng, leaders of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee (民革) in Guangxi, wrote a letter to Li Jishen, Chairman of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee, denouncing the exposure of the ugly history of rightists as "grave robbing and corpse whipping." The following is an excerpt from the letter:
    We read in the newspaper the speeches of several comrades criticizing the erroneous statements of Long Yun and Huang Shaohong at the enlarged meeting of the Central Small Group of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee on June 18th.

    Some comrades, when conducting criticism, seem to have departed from Chairman Mao's famous formula of "unity - criticism - unity." Chen Qiyuan asked Huang Shaohong to calmly recall the crimes he committed thirty years ago when he was the Chairman of Guangxi Province; Ning Wu said that the local people hated Long Yun and Huang Shaohong to the bone for what they had done in the past. We and many comrades with more complex histories, who have committed sins against the people in the past, although not completely ignorant of the Party's glorious policies of "leniency for confession, no blame for the past, and rewards for meritorious service," are still appalled and horrified to hear such shrill voices of "grave robbing and corpse whipping" coming from within the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee today, after everyone's history has been explained for many years and many times!

    According to some of the formulations in the speeches of Chen and Ning, it is not difficult to recognize that those who have committed sins in the past cannot criticize the Party. This is not a correct understanding of criticism. In our view, for extremely erroneous and absurd statements, we must theoretically dig out their roots, and we must thoroughly analyze them with a spirit that is both serious and earnest, and gentle and drizzling, in order to completely smash and bury them. Simply putting on big hats, simply digging up the "old accounts" of the critics, this cannot be considered supporting the Party's call, and objectively it will play a role in blocking the Communist Party's channels for speech.

    It is assumed that the histories of Chen and Ning are probably "clean" like flawless jade, or at least more pure than those of Long, Huang, and many comrades of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee whom they criticize. But here we are reminded of a passage from the novel "The Gadfly": To make fun of someone inferior to oneself is unkind, even cowardly; it is like mocking a cripple, or... something. What we need from the Central Committee members and what we ask of them is: to often care for and cherish comrades, to take the lead in promoting unity, and to educate and help everyone to make progress together; not to show off their own "cleanliness," and even less to despise others with their own so-called "cleanliness," or to dig up the old cases of comrades from many years ago.

    What can be done? Our members mainly come from the military and political circles of the Kuomintang. There are Qing Dynasty remnants, Beiyang government personnel, and extreme rightists in the Kuomintang, and their historical dirtiness is destined. According to our observations in local work, a considerable number of Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee comrades are still carrying heavy historical burdens today, which relatively affects their progress and their boldness in being responsible for their work. As Party leaders, if they ignore the specific circumstances that exist today, and do not consider what the objective effect of speaking freely and enjoying themselves for a while will be, and if the ideological burdens of the members become heavier and heavier, is this something that only local workers should be worried about?

    We believe that when helping the Communist Party to rectify its work style and when our organization is about to launch its own rectification, the Central Committee should clarify the goals, requirements, and methods, and all Party comrades should follow them to improve their thinking and strengthen unity. The atmosphere of "grave robbing and corpse whipping" should be stopped immediately. If it continues to spread, it will lead to a dreadful situation where everyone is in danger and even exposes each other's shameful past.

### 揭露右派分子的罪恶史是掘墓鞭尸  陈良佐、陈雄、赖慧鹏的一封信

　　揭露右派分子的罪恶史是掘墓鞭尸
　  陈良佐、陈雄、赖慧鹏的一封信
    6月22日，广西民革领导人陈良佐、陈雄、赖慧鹏三人给民革主席李济深一封信，污蔑揭发右派分子的丑恶历史为“掘墓鞭尸”，现将该信摘要如下：
    从报上看到几位同志在6月18日民革中央小组扩大会议上批判龙云、黄绍竑两人错误言论的发言。
    有些同志在进行批评时，仿佛是离开了毛主席的“团结——批评——团结”这个著名的公式。陈其瑗要黄绍竑冷静回忆三十年前当广西省主席时的罪恶；宁武则说，龙云、黄绍竑二人过去在地方上的所作所为，当地老百姓是恨之入骨。我们和好些历史比较复杂、过去对人民曾是有罪的同志，尽管对“坦白从宽、已往不究、立功受奖”等党的光辉政策不是一窍不通，可是，当大家的历史已交代了好些年，也交代过好多次的今天，仍然听到这种来自民革内部的“掘墓鞭尸”的凄厉声音，殊难令人不起怵目惊心之感！
    照陈、宁二位发言中的一些提法，不难令人意识为：凡是过去有罪的人就不能对党进行批评。这不是对于批评的正确理解。我们的看法，对于十分错误和荒谬的言论，必须从理论上挖去它的根，必须本着既严肃认真、又和风细雨的方针，深入分析，才能彻底粉碎它、埋葬它。光是扣大帽子，光是翻提意见者的“旧账”，这不但不能算是拥护党的号召，而且在客观上还会起到替共产党堵塞言路的作用。
    料想陈、宁二位的历史可能“清白”得如白璧之无瑕似的，至少也会比之他们所指摘的龙、黄和许多民革同志要纯洁。但是在这里我们想起了“牛虻”这部小说里的一段话：把一个不如自己的人拿来开玩笑，是一种不宽厚，甚至是卑怯的行为；这就好比去嘲笑一个瘸子，或者……一样。我们所需要的中央委员和要求于他们的是：经常关心爱护同志，带头搞好团结，教育帮助大家共同进步；而不是卖弄他们自己的“清白”，更不是以他们自己的所谓“清白”去嫌弃别人，去挖掘同志们多少年前的旧案。
    有什么办法呢？我们成员主要是来自国民党的军政界。清朝遗老、北洋政府人员和国民党中的极右派都有，历史的肮脏是注定了的。照我们 在地方工作中的观察，相当数量的民革同志，今天还在背着沉重的历史包袱，这就相对地影响了他们的进步和对工作的大胆负责。作为党的领导，如果无视于当前存在的具体情况，不考虑放言高论、快意一时所起的客观效果将是什么，假设成员的思想包袱越背越重，难道这只是地方工作者才应担心的吗？
    我们认为，在帮助共产党整风和我们组织也即将开展整风之时，中央应该把目的、要求和做法明确起来，全党同志遵循着来进行，这才能提高思想，加强团结。“掘墓鞭尸”的风气应该马上结束。如再蔓延下去，将会导致人人自危、甚至互扬秽史的可恶情境。
