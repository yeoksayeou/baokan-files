　　In Fraternal Countries
    Soviet Union Designs Integrated Power Plant Utilizing Solid Fuels
    The Soviet Union has designed an experimental integrated power plant that utilizes solid fuels. This plant can not only generate electricity but also chemically process the fuel used (coal, peat, combustible shale) to extract products such as heavy tar and gas.
    Preliminary test results have demonstrated that this method of integrated solid fuel utilization is highly economical. For example, one thousand tons of dry combustible shale, after chemical processing in a dedicated thermal processing chamber, can yield one hundred and forty-three tons of heavy tar, over eighty thousand cubic meters of high-calorie gas, and three hundred and fifty tons of cementitious material for construction. The processed shale, when used as fuel in power plant furnaces, can also produce three hundred and fifty tons of saturated steam for electricity generation.
    Currently, the first batch of these new "power stations," with capacities ranging from ten thousand to twenty thousand kilowatts, have begun operation. One of these "power stations" consumes nine tons of peat per hour, and in addition to producing electricity, it can also generate forty thousand cubic meters of gas per day. This gas is sufficient to supply a city with a population of thirty thousand to thirty-five thousand people.
    By adopting this integrated method, the coal required for producing electricity and gas can be reduced by nearly 30%. Currently, all thermal power plants in the Soviet Union consume over eighty million tons of coal annually. By adopting this integrated method, two hundred and forty million tons of coal could be saved annually.
    Based on the experience of the existing integrated power plants, even larger integrated power plants can be built. To this end, the Power Research Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences has developed rapid methods for thermal separation of various grades of coal, peat, and combustible shale, as well as for obtaining high-quality gas and tar from them. These methods can accelerate the chemical processing of fuels by hundreds of times.
    Czech Pastries Sold to Over Forty Countries
    Czechoslovakian pastry factories produce six hundred and fifty different kinds of chocolates, pastries, and biscuits. These pastries have more varieties than those made in some major traditional pastry-producing countries. The production and consumption of Czech pastries are twice as high as in the most prosperous year of 1937 before the war. Biscuit production is ten times higher than then, and the prices are much cheaper.
    Currently, Czech-made pastries are exported to over forty countries, with the largest buyers being Britain, Belgium, France, East Germany, Canada, Sweden, Luxembourg, and some African and Arab countries.
    Albania Establishes First Comprehensive University
    Recently, the People's Republic of Albania's first comprehensive university, the Tirana State University, was established. The State University is currently the highest institution of education and science in Albania. According to the decision of the Council of Ministers, it will establish six faculties. The university has forty-six lecture halls, thirty laboratories, approximately forty classrooms, three showrooms, and a library of scientific books. The university will also be an important scientific publishing center, and it will regularly publish bulletins and newspapers. The university president, Chala Keriji, said in his speech at the founding ceremony that the National University guarantees the Party and the government that it will play an active role in the development of the people's economy and the development of education and culture.
　  Democratic Korea Utilizes Various Wild Fruits to Make Wine and Pastries
    The Kanggye Wine Factory in Korea, which went into production at the beginning of this year, uses wild grapes, strawberries, wild pears, Schisandra chinensis, and other ingredients to produce various wines, syrups, and pastries. This factory has already produced 140,000 liters of wine and syrup using wild grapes and wild pears collected by farmers in the province last year. Since June, they have also used peony and Schisandra chinensis to produce ginseng wine and Schisandra wine. (Attached picture)
    This is the new Polish pig breed recently promoted - the Pławsk pig breed. This pig is characterized by convenient feeding and strong reproductive rate.

    苏联设计出综合利用固体燃料的动力联合工厂
    苏联设计出一种试验性的综合利用固体燃料的动力联合工厂。这种工厂不但可以发电，而且同时可以对发电所用的燃料（煤、泥煤、可燃页岩）进行化学处理，从其中取得重焦油、煤气等产品。
    初步试验结果证明，这种综合利用固体燃料的方法有很高的经济效果。例如，一千吨干燥可燃的页岩在专门的热处理室内经过化学处理以后，能够得到一百四十三吨重焦油、八万多立方公尺的高热量煤气、三百五十吨建筑用的胶结材料；将处理后的页岩送到电站火炉作燃料，还可以生产出三百五十吨可以用来发电的饱和蒸汽。
    目前，第一批功率为一万到两万瓩的这种新型“发电站”已经开始运转。其中的一个“发电站”每小时消耗九吨泥煤，除生产电力外，每昼夜还能够生产四万立方公尺的煤气。这些煤气足够供应一个有三万到三万五千人口的城市之用。
    采用这种综合方法，能够使生产电力和煤气所需的煤比原来减少将近30％。现在，全苏联所有火力发电站每年消耗八千多万吨煤，而采用这种综合方法后，每年就可以节省二千四百万吨煤。
    根据已经运转的这种动力联合工厂的情况，还可以建设功率更大的动力联合工厂。为了这个目的，苏联科学院动力研究所已经研究出了各级煤、泥煤和可燃页岩的热分离以及从中获得质量好的煤气和焦油的快速方法。这种方法能使燃料的化学处理工艺过程加快数百倍。
    捷点心销售四十余国
    捷克斯洛伐克点心工厂生产着六百五十种不同的巧克力糖、点心和饼干。这些点心的花样比一些历来出产点心的主要国家作的还要多。捷点心的生产和消费量比战前最繁荣的1937年还要高两倍。饼干比那时多了十倍，而且价钱便宜很多。
    现在捷制的点心向四十多个国家出口，最大的买主有英国、比利时、法国、民主德国、加拿大、瑞典、卢森堡和一些非洲和阿拉伯国家。
    阿成立第一所综合性大学
    最近，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的第一所综合性大学——地拉那国立大学成立了。国立大学是目前阿尔巴尼亚教育和科学的最高学府。根据部长会议的决定，它将设立六个系。大学内有四十六个讲堂、三十个实验室、约四十个课室、三个陈列室和一个科学书籍图书馆。大学也将是一个重要的科学出版中心，它将定期出版一些公报和报纸。大学校长柴拉·凯里奇在成立大会上的讲话中说，国立大学向党和政府保证，它将在人民经济的发展中，在教育和文化的发展中起积极的作用。
　  民主朝鲜利用各种野生果子制酒作点心
    今年年初投入生产的朝鲜江界葡萄酒工厂，利用山葡萄、草莓、山梨、五味子等生产各种酒、糖汁和点心等食品。这个工厂利用道内农民去年采集的山葡萄和山梨等原料，已生产了十四万升葡萄酒和糖汁。他们从6月以来，还利用芍药、五味子等生产了人参酒和五味酒。（附图片）
