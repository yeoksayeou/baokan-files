Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 2nd (TASS dispatch): The CPC Central Committee and the Soviet Council of Ministers decided on August 1st, in a resolution on the development of housing construction, that the Soviet Union will eliminate the domestic housing shortage within the next ten to twelve years.

    The resolution stated that during the years of Soviet power, the total residential area in cities and towns has increased by 2.7 times. However, due to the implementation of the national industrialization plan and the emergence of many new industrial centers, the urban population has more than doubled in thirty years. Despite the continuous expansion of urban housing construction, the rapid growth of residents has made the housing problem a prominent one.

    The resolution stipulates that during this Five-Year Plan period (1956-1960), the area of state-built housing will be increased from 205 million square meters as stipulated by the 20th Congress of the CPSU to 215 million square meters.

    The area of housing built with private funds and state loans will be increased to 113 million square meters, originally stipulated as only 84 million square meters.

    The housing built by collective farm members and rural intellectuals in collective farms will reach 4 million units, almost double the number built in the previous Five-Year Plan.

    During this Five-Year Plan, the state's investment in housing construction will increase by 78 billion rubles compared to the previous Five-Year Plan.

    In order to industrialize housing construction and reduce construction costs, the resolution stipulates that the annual production capacity of enterprises manufacturing prefabricated houses should be increased to 20 million square meters, while increasing the annual construction of prefabricated house components using local materials to 10 million square meters.

    苏共中央和部长会议通过决议
    十二年内解决住宅不足问题
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏共中央委员会和苏联部长会议8月1日决定，通过的关于发展住宅建设的决议中，苏联将在最近十年到十二年内消除国内住宅不足的状况。
    决议中说，在苏维埃政权的年代里，城市和市镇的住宅总面积已经增加了二点七倍。而由于实现国家工业化计划和产生许多新的工业中心，城市居民在三十年中就增加了两倍多，尽管城市住宅建设不断扩大，居民的迅速增长使得住房问题仍然是一个尖锐的问题。
    决议规定，在这一个五年计划期间（1956—1960年）国家建筑住宅的面积将由苏共第二十次代表大会规定的二亿零五百万平方公尺增加到二亿一千五百万平方公尺。
    用私人资金和国家贷款建筑的住宅面积将增加到一亿一千三百万平方公尺。原先规定的只是八千四百万平方公尺。
    用集体农庄庄员和农村知识分子的力量在集体农庄建造的住房将达到四百万幢，几乎比在上一个五年计划中建造的住房多一倍。
    在这个五年计划中，国家在住宅建设方面的投资将比上个五年计划增加七百八十亿卢布。
    为了使住宅建设工业化和降低建筑成本，决议规定，把制造预装配房屋企业的年度生产能力提高到两千万平方公尺，同时把每年利用地方材料建造的预装配房屋构件增加到一千万平方公尺。
