On the Anti-Rightist Struggle Front

    Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant Workers
    Vigorously Criticize Rightist Liu Zhonghou
    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 6th: Workers at the Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant refuted the reactionary statements of bourgeois rightist Liu Zhonghou.
    Liu Zhonghou was a probationary technician in the standardization office of the Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant. During the rectification movement, under the guise of helping the Party rectify its work, he proposed that the Party's leadership should be "abolished" in the factory, "a technical committee should be established with the chief engineer as the leader, and the factory director and Party Secretary should serve as deputies"; the Party in the factory "should not play a decisive role, but only a supervisory role." He also absurdly said: "The Party is engaged in revolution, and now that it has succeeded, the Party should be abolished," and suggested that the trade union is now "unnecessary."
    Liu Zhonghou's reactionary remarks, attempting to abolish the Party's leadership, were met with a head-on attack by the workers.

    Zhang Xiaohu Wanted to be a "Nagy"
    Liaoning and Shenyang Radio Stations Exposed Him
    Our newspaper, Shenyang, 5th: Recently, all the staff of Liaoning and Shenyang People's Broadcasting Station held meetings for days, launching a ruthless exposure and criticism of the rightist Zhang Xiaohu, the editor of the "Literary Window" of the Literature and Art Group, who had consistently opposed the Party and socialism for twenty years. This rightist element, who has always stirred up trouble and is wildly ambitious, took the opportunity of helping the Party to rectify its work, colluded with rightists Xu Mai, Wu Rong, Wu Congfang, etc., and launched a major attack on the Party. Zhang Xiaohu said: "I will create a 'Hungarian incident' in the radio station, and once it succeeds, Xu Mai and I will be the Nagy of the radio station." During the period of airing views, Zhang Xiaohu called on Party members, League members, and activists to carry out a so-called "uprising," while doing his utmost to undermine the prestige of the leadership, so as to separate the masses from the leadership of the Party. Zhang Xiaohu and others openly proposed: "You step down, and we must be allowed to come to power and lead."
    Zhang Xiaohu began his anti-communist and anti-people activities at the age of seventeen. In 1944, with the help of Kuomintang secret service chief Chen Lifu, Zhang Xiaohu entered the Department of Journalism at Fudan University and became a famous "Sanminzhuyi Youth Corps political commentator."

    Gejiu Workers Refuted Lü Miannan
    Our newspaper reports: The debate between engineering and technical personnel and the broad masses of workers in Gejiu and the bourgeois rightist Lü Miannan, deputy manager of Yunnan Tin Industry Company, has been victorious.
    Lü Miannan once demanded that the Communist Party "hand over the power to make decisions" during the period of great airing of views. He demanded that the Party implement a cadre policy of "cultivating virtue with talent," and falsely accused previous socialist movements of "lacking right and wrong."
    At nearly a hundred large and small debate meetings, although he tried to quibble in every possible way, he was rendered speechless and completely isolated when thousands of veteran workers exposed his crimes of suppressing workers when he was the boss of a tin mine before liberation.

    Wu Zonghuang's Ugly Face Completely Exposed
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: All the personnel of the State Council's Foreign Experts Bureau have held meetings for days to expose and criticize Wu Zonghuang, a member of the Propaganda Section of the Bureau and a Communist Party member, for his anti-Communist and anti-socialist remarks.
    A large amount of exposed material proves that Wu Zonghuang played a shameful "internal accomplice" in this frantic attack on the Communist Party by bourgeois rightists, and he has completely betrayed the Communist Party. He vilely attacked the Communist Party, saying that "the Party's thinking is rigid and cannot keep up with the development of the times," and falsely accused the Communist Party of "venerating" Marxism-Leninism "as sacred dogma," "without freedom of speech," and so on.
    At several consecutive conferences, many people conducted reasoned struggles with Wu Zonghuang based on ample facts. In the end, Wu Zonghuang had no choice but to bow his head and confess his guilt in the face of truth and facts, admitting that he was "a complete rightist" and expressing his willingness to make a thorough confession.

    在反右派斗争战线上
    沈阳矿山机器厂职工
    痛击右派分子刘忠侯
    据新华社沈阳6日电　沈阳矿山机器厂的职工驳斥了资产阶级右派分子刘忠侯的反动言论。
    刘忠侯是沈阳矿山机器厂标准化室的见习技术员。在整风运动中，他假借帮助党整风的名义，提出在工厂里“应取消党的领导权”，“成立技术委员会，以总工程师为领导，厂长、党委书记作副职”；党在工厂里“不应该起决定性的作用，只应该起监督作用”。他还荒谬地说：“党是搞革命的，现在成功了，应该取消党”，并且提出工会现在也“不必存在”了。
    刘忠侯企图取消党的领导的反动言论，遭到职工们的迎头痛击。
    张啸虎想当“纳吉”
    辽宁、沈阳广播电台揭穿了他
    本报沈阳5日电　最近辽宁、沈阳人民广播电台的全体工作人员，连日举行大会，对二十年来一贯反党、反社会主义的文艺组“文学窗”编辑右派分子张啸虎，展开了无情的揭发和批判。这个一贯兴风作浪、野心勃勃的右派分子在整风期间，以帮助党整风为借口，纠合了右派分子徐迈、吴融、吴从枋等，大举向党进攻。张啸虎说：“我在电台制造‘匈牙利事件’，一旦成功，我和徐迈就是电台的纳吉”。张啸虎在鸣放期间，号召党团员、积极分子进行所谓“起义”，同时极力破坏领导的威信，以便使群众离开党的领导。张啸虎等就公开提出、“你们下台，得让我们上台领导。”
    张啸虎十七岁就开始了反共、反人民的勾当。1944年，张啸虎在国民党特务头子陈立夫的帮助下，进入复旦大学新闻系，成为出名的“三青团政论家”。
    个旧职工驳倒了吕冕南
    本报讯　个旧的工程技术人员和广大职工同资产阶级右派分子、云南锡业公司副经理吕冕南的说理斗争已经得胜。
    吕冕南在大鸣大放中曾经要求共产党“交出决定问题的大权”。他要求党执行“以才培德”的干部政策，并诬蔑历次社会主义运动是“没有是非”。
    在近百次大小辩论会上，他虽多方狡辩，但当几千老工人揭发了他在解放以前作锡矿老板时镇压工人的罪恶事实，使他哑口无言完全孤立了。　（新华社专稿）
    吴宗熿丑恶面目完全暴露
    据新华社讯　国务院外国专家局的全体人员连日来举行大会，揭露和批判这个局宣教科科员、共产党员吴宗熿反共产党反社会主义的言论。
    揭露出来的大量材料证明，吴宗熿在这次资产阶级右派分子向共产党猖狂进攻中，充当了可耻的“内应”，他已经完全叛变了共产党。他卑鄙地攻击共产党，说“党的思想僵化，不能跟上时代的发展”，并诬蔑共产党把马克思列宁主义“奉为圣条”，“没有言论自由”，等等。
    在连续召开的几次大会上，许多人以充分的事实为根据同吴宗熿进行了说理斗争。最后，吴宗熿不得不在真理和事实面前低头认罪，承认他是“十足的右派分子”，并表示要彻底交代。
