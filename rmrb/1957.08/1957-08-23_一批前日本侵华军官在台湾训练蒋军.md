　　Xinhua News Agency, August 21st: A group of former Japanese invasion army officers are currently in Taiwan, training Chiang Kai-shek's group's field and general grade officers. This was revealed in the August 19th issue of the U.S.-backed Taiwanese semi-monthly "Free China." The publication stated that this training institution is located near Taipei and is known by Chiang's military personnel as the "underground school."

　　According to a Pan-Asia News Agency report from Tokyo, approximately twenty former Japanese senior officers went to Taiwan before 1949. They were selected by Okamura Neiji and sent to Taiwan through secret negotiations between the MacArthur Headquarters in Tokyo at the time and the Kuomintang military delegation stationed in Japan. They are responsible for training in areas such as war history, intelligence, operations, mobilization, supply, and air force affairs. Over the years, they have trained more than 10,000 Chiang military officers. These former Japanese officers are nominally the Chiang Kai-shek group's "technical advisors" in Taiwan, and are given the treatment of major generals or lieutenant generals by Chiang's military.

　  一批前日本侵华军官在台湾训练蒋军
    新华社21日讯　一批前日本侵华军官正在台湾替蒋介石集团训练校级和将级军官，这是19日出版的一期由美国撑腰的台湾“自由中国”半月刊揭露的。这家刊物说，这个训练机构设在台北市附近，蒋军人员都把它叫做“地下学校”。
    据泛亚社东京消息，大约二十名前日本高级军官在1949年前去台湾。他们经过当时东京的麦克阿瑟总部和国民党驻日军事代表团秘密谈判的安排，由冈村宁次挑选出来送往台湾。他们分别负责关于战史、情报、作战、动员、供应和空军事务等方面的训练，几年来已经训练了一万多名蒋军军官。这批前日本军官在台湾名义上是蒋介石集团的“技术顾问”，而由蒋军给予少将或中将的待遇。
