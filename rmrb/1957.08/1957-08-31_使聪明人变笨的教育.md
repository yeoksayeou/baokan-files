    Education That Makes Smart People Dumb

    American educators Homer and Doddy recently pointed out to reporters from "U.S. News & World Report" magazine that the current American education makes "smart people dumb, while dumb brains completely stop working."

    They said that this misfortune began after the popularity of Dewey's theory. Since then, American educators have believed that they have no responsibility to impart knowledge and have formulated "life adaptation subjects" to replace extremely useful courses. In middle schools, courses such as "Family Life," "Consumer Economics," "Career News," "Physical and Mental Health," and "World Citizen Training" have been offered. As a result, natural science and humanities courses have been squeezed out. Homer and Doddy pointed out, "Currently, half of the middle schools in the United States do not even have chemistry courses, and 53% of the middle schools do not teach physics."

    At present, American middle schools have implemented free elective courses. High school compulsory courses only include English, American History, and Physiology and Hygiene. As a result, very few people study those particularly difficult subjects. Homer and Doddy told reporters from this magazine, "The number of students studying algebra in middle school has decreased from 56% in 1900 to the current 24%, the number studying geometry has decreased from 27% to 11%, and the number studying physics has decreased from 19% to 4.3%. Only 2% of students study trigonometry."

    The bad consequences of implementing this education system have already manifested themselves. The number of American college students studying science and engineering subjects is decreasing day by day. The shortage of scientists and engineers is becoming increasingly serious.

### 使聪明人变笨的教育

    使聪明人变笨的教育
    美国著名教育家霍默尔和多迪最近对“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志的记者指出，美国目前的教育使“聪明人变笨，而笨脑子则完全停止了工作”。
    他们说，这种不幸是从杜威的学说流行以后开始的。从此以后，美国的教育工作者就认为，他们没有责任传授知识，并且制订了“适应生活的科目”来代替极有用的课程。在中学里开设了“家庭生活”、“消费经济学”、“职业消息”、“身体和精神健康”“世界公民训练”等等课程。结果，自然科学和人文科学课程都被挤掉了。霍默尔和多迪指出，“现在在美国有一半中学甚至连化学课都没有，有53％的中学不教物理。”
    目前美国的中学实现了自由选课，高中必修课程只有英语、美国史和生理卫生三门，结果那些特别难的功课很少有人学习了。霍默尔和多迪对这家杂志的记者说，“中学里学代数的学生从1900年的56％降低到目前的24％，学几何的由27％降低到11％，而学物理的从19％降低到4.3％。只有2％的学生学三角。”
    实行这种教育制度的恶果目前已经表现出来。美国学习理工科目的大学生人数日益减少。科学家和工程师缺乏的程度日益严重。
