Comprehensive report from our newspaper:

According to Xinhua News Agency: The Syrian government received a letter on August 4th from Egypt and Saudi Arabia to the Syrian government regarding the ultimatum issued to Syria by Jordanian Foreign Minister Rifai. In this letter, both governments criticized Jordan's attitude and supported Syria's stance in responding to the Jordanian authorities.

The news agency quoted Damascus political figures as saying that due to Syria's response, Rifai was unable to achieve his conspiracy aimed at withdrawing the Syrian diplomatic mission in Amman.

Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar said on August 4th that Syria had taken all necessary measures to ensure Syria's security after receiving the Jordanian ultimatum.

According to a report in Cairo's "Al-Akhbar," officers of the Egyptian-Syrian Joint Command in Cairo held meetings all night on August 3rd and were in contact with the Damascus branch of the command. "Al-Akhbar" also stated that the latest talks of the Egyptian-Syrian Joint Command had been notified to Saudi Arabia.

Cairo News: Arab League Secretary-General Hassouna visited Egyptian Foreign Minister Fawzi and Syrian Ambassador Azem on the 4th to discuss the issue of Syrian-Jordanian relations caused by the Jordanian ultimatum. Hassouna said that he was also in contact with other member states of the League to study the measures the League could take in accordance with its charter.

According to Amman news: A Jordanian government spokesman denied late on August 4th that Jordanian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Rifai had issued an ultimatum to Syria threatening military action against Syria.

According to the spokesman's explanation, Rifai told the Syrian embassy's chargé d'affaires that if the Syrian government did not stop the "anti-Jordanian propaganda campaign," Jordan was concerned that this situation would develop to a certain extent, and "the Jordanian government would have to take necessary measures to defend its dignity."

This explanation is considered to be, in effect, a repetition of threats against Syria.

According to Washington news: Eisenhower met with the new Jordanian Ambassador Yousef Haikal on August 2nd. Eisenhower praised Jordanian King Hussein and stated that "the United States government will continue to support Jordan."

Haikal told reporters that he and Eisenhower discussed the situation in the Middle East "generally." He "hoped that with the full assistance of the United States" the problem would be resolved. He also hoped to "strengthen the existing good relations between Jordan and the United States."

Cairo and Damascus newspapers unanimously condemned the ultimatum issued by Jordan to Syria on the 4th.

Syrian "Al-Nour" said that Rifai's "despicable warning" proved that "the Eisenhower Doctrine has provoked a frenzy in Jordan."

"Al-Nour" pointed out that the Jordanian rulers who betrayed their country to the Americans intend to sever Jordan's relations with Syria and Egypt in order to make Jordan the second American base after Israel.

Syrian "Al-Sham" said: "We believe that Rifai's words were dictated by his master, the Americans."

Egyptian "Al-Gomhouria" editor Sadat questioned whether Jordan's provocation was part of the Eisenhower Doctrine and whether it was the result of Dulles' talks in London.

Egyptian "Al-Ahram" said that the new imperialist bridgehead originally established in Tel Aviv has now been transferred to Amman. It said: "The (American) Sixth Fleet must be prepared to mobilize, waiting for action, because Jordan has now created the desired events intended to trigger a hostile outbreak."

Egyptian "Al-Shaab" said that Rifai is determined to continue to act as an imperialist pawn, formerly British, and now American.

    埃沙两国支持叙利亚指责约旦
    艾森豪威尔公开表示继续给约旦撑腰
    叙埃报纸斥美国利用约旦为侵略走卒
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：叙利亚通讯社报道，叙利亚政府8月4日收到了埃及和沙特阿拉伯就约旦外交大臣里法伊向叙利亚提出的最后通牒给叙利亚政府的一封信。在这封信中，两国政府都指责了约旦的态度，并且支持叙利亚在回答约旦当局的时候所采取的态度。
    这家通讯社引用大马士革政界人士的话说，由于叙利亚的答复，使里法伊不能实现目的在于使叙利亚驻安曼的外交代表团撤退的阴谋。
    叙利亚外交部长比塔尔8月4日说，叙利亚在接到约旦的最后通牒以后，已经采取了一切必要措施来保证叙利亚的安全。
    据开罗“消息报”报道，在开罗的埃—叙联合司令部的军官们8月3日晚上彻夜举行会议并且同这个司令部在大马士革的分部进行了联系。“消息报”又说，已经把埃—叙联合司令部最新的会谈情况通知了沙特阿拉伯。
    开罗消息：阿拉伯联盟秘书长哈苏纳4日访问了埃及外交部长法齐和叙利亚大使阿泽姆，讨论由于约旦的最后通牒所引起的叙利亚和约旦的关系问题。哈苏纳说，他也在和联盟其他成员国接触，研究联盟可以根据它的章程采取的措施。
    据安曼消息：约旦政府发言人在8月4日深夜否认约旦副首相兼外交大臣里法伊曾经对叙利亚提出最后通牒，威胁要对叙利亚采取武力行动。
    按照这个发言人的解释，里法伊对叙利亚大使馆代办说：如果叙利亚政府不制止“反约旦宣传运动”，约旦担心，这种局面继续发展到一定程度，“约旦政府将不得不采取必要的措施来保卫自己的尊严”。
    这个解释被认为实际上仍旧是重复对叙利亚进行威胁。
    据华盛顿消息：艾森豪威尔8月2日接见新任约旦大使优素福·赫卡尔。艾森豪威尔称赞了约旦国王侯赛因，并且表示“美国政府将继续支持约旦。”
    赫卡尔对记者们说，他和艾森豪威尔“一般地”谈论了中东局势。他“希望在美国的全力协助下”问题将会得到解决。他还希望“加强约旦和美国之间现存的良好关系”。
    开罗和大马士革的报纸在4日一致谴责约旦向叙利亚提出的最后通牒。
    叙利亚“光明报”说，里法伊这个“卑鄙的警告”证明，“艾森豪威尔主义在约旦挑起了疯狂的浪潮”。
    “光明报”指出，卖国给美国人的约旦统治者打算割断约旦同叙利亚和埃及的关系，以便使约旦继以色列之后成为第二个美国基地。
    叙利亚“沙姆报”说：“我们认为，里法伊所说的话，是他的主人美国人指使的。”
    埃及“共和国报”主编萨达特质问道，约旦的挑衅是不是艾森豪威尔主义的一部分？是不是杜勒斯在伦敦会谈的结果？
    埃及“金字塔报”说，原来在特拉维夫建立的新帝国主义的桥头堡，现在已经转移到安曼。它说：“（美国）第六舰队必然作好了准备，待机出动，因为现在约旦已经制造了所希望的意在引起敌对爆发的事件。”
    埃及“人民报”说，里法伊决心继续充当帝国主义的走卒，以前是英国的，而现在是美国的。
