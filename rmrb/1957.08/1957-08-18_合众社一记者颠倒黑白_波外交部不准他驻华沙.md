    UPI Reporter Distorts Facts
    Polish Foreign Ministry Forbids His Residence in Warsaw
    (Dispatch from our newspaper in Warsaw, August 17th) The Polish Foreign Ministry sternly denounced Cavendish, the Warsaw-based reporter for the United Press International (UPI), for consistently stirring up trouble and distorting facts, and revoked his accreditation as a resident reporter in Warsaw.
    On August 16th, the Press Department of the Polish Foreign Ministry summoned Cavendish and announced on the spot that during his tenure as a reporter stationed in Warsaw, he had consistently written untrue and ill-intentioned reports, thereby distorting the actual situation in Poland. In particular, his recent news about the so-called strike of tram workers in Lodz (note: the tram workers in Lodz who went on strike on August 12th have admitted their mistakes and resumed work on the 13th), not only viciously fabricated facts but also attempted to incite an unfriendly atmosphere towards Poland abroad.

    合众社一记者颠倒黑白
    波外交部不准他驻华沙
    本报华沙17日电  波兰外交部严词斥责一贯挑弄是非、颠倒黑白的美国合众社常驻华沙记者卡芬迪斯，并取消他的常驻华沙记者资格。
    8月16日，波兰外交部新闻司召见卡芬迪斯，当场宣布由于他在驻华沙记者期间，一贯地写出不真实、别有用心的报道，从而歪曲了波兰的实际情况。特别是最近他发出的关于所谓罗兹电车工人罢工的消息（按：8月12日罢工的罗兹市电车工人已经承认错误并于13日复工），不仅恶毒地捏造事实，而且企图煽起国外对波兰不友好的空气。
