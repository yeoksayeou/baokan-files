Even with a Bumper Harvest, Waste is Unacceptable
Anhui Province Launches Education on Frugal Housekeeping

    (Our dispatch) After Anhui Province reaped a bumper summer harvest, various counties have launched education for farmers on frugal housekeeping.

    This year, Anhui Province had a bumper summer harvest, and some farmers began to exhibit extravagant and wasteful behavior. In Fu Guang Agricultural Cooperative of Fuyang County, many members started eating three dry meals a day after the wheat harvest, with some families consuming an average of three *jin* of grain per person per day after the harvest. Many farmers also used wheat to trade for meat and alcohol. Sales of cigarettes and alcohol increased significantly in many places.

    Some agricultural cooperative cadres, seeing the good wheat harvest this year, held a one-sided mass perspective, believing that it was okay for members to eat and drink a little more, and neglecting the long-term livelihood of the members. Within the agricultural cooperatives, they also did not pay attention to running the cooperative frugally.

    In response to the above phenomena, Anhui Province launched a propaganda and education movement with frugal housekeeping as its theme. Various counties universally convened all kinds of frugal housekeeping symposiums, using the method of detailed accounting to conduct comparative education for farmers, contrasting typical frugal and wasteful households. For example, Qunsheng Agricultural Cooperative in Feidong County used the contrast between the households of Tang Daqing and Xia Jiayuan to educate all cooperative members. Both households had large populations and comparable labor forces. Their autumn income last year was also roughly the same, but Xia's family was frugal, while Tang's family was neither diligent nor frugal. By March of this year, Tang's family was already short of grain, and the agricultural cooperative had to lend him seventy yuan to maintain their livelihood. On the other hand, Xia's family lived frugally on a regular basis, and the whole family worked diligently. Not only did their living standards not decrease compared to after the autumn harvest, but they also invested twenty yuan in the agricultural cooperative, saved one hundred and thirty yuan, and still had surplus grain from last autumn's distribution when the new grain came down this year. Using such concrete and vivid facts to conduct propaganda among the masses has had a very good effect.

    Some places, while raising farmers' awareness of frugal housekeeping, also mobilized farmers to formulate family-building plans and summarize many methods of frugal housekeeping. Many agricultural cooperatives have made concrete arrangements for those households with actual difficulties.

    Anhui Province has had a bumper wheat harvest, and early rice and mid-season rice harvests are also in sight. Timely launching education on frugal housekeeping can prevent waste early on, and the number of grain-deficient households can be greatly reduced. This is of great significance for consolidating agricultural cooperatives, supporting socialist construction, and improving and raising people's living standards. (Wu Rongjiang)

### 丰收了也不能浪费  安徽省开展勤俭持家教育

    丰收了也不能浪费
    安徽省开展勤俭持家教育
    本报讯　安徽各县在夏季丰收后对农民进行了勤俭持家的教育。
    今年安徽省夏季丰收，部分农民开始发生了铺张浪费现象。阜阳县阜光农业社许多社员，麦收后一天吃三顿干的，有的家庭在麦收以后平均每人每天用粮达三斤。还有许多农民用麦子换肉吃，换酒喝。许多地方，烟酒销量大增。
    一部分农业社干部，看到今年麦子丰收，抱着片面的群众观点，认为社员多吃喝一点没有关系，忽视了社员的长远生活。在农业社里也不注意勤俭办社。
    针对以上现象，安徽省开展了一个勤俭持家为内容的宣传教育运动。各县普遍召开了各式各样的勤俭持家座谈会，对农民中勤俭与浪费的典型户，用算细账办法向农民进行对比教育。如肥东县群生农业社用唐大清和夏家元二户对比，教育全社社员。这二户人口都多，劳动力相当。去年秋季收入也大致相同，但夏家勤俭，唐家不勤不俭，到今年3月，唐家已经缺粮，农业社借给他七十元才维持住生活。而夏家平常过日子节省，全家勤劳，不但生活水平一直没有比秋后降低，还向农业社投资了二十元，储蓄一百三十元，去年秋季分配的粮食接到今年新粮下来还有余。用这样具体生动的事实，向群众进行宣传，效果很好。
    有些地方在提高农民对勤俭持家的认识的同时，又发动农民制定兴家计划，总结农民不少勤俭持家的办法。对那些有实际困难的户，许多农业社都作了具体安排。
    安徽省小麦丰收了，早稻、中稻也丰收在望。及时开展勤俭持家教育，就能及早防止浪费，缺粮户可大为减少。这对巩固农业社、支持社会主义建设、改善和提高人民生活水平都有着重大的意义。（吴荣江）
