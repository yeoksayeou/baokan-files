    Setting Fires Everywhere, Fantasizing About Reversing the Five-Anti Campaign's Verdicts
    Zheng Lizhai's Ugly Face Exposed
    (Our newspaper's Lanzhou dispatch, August 13th) The Lanzhou Municipal Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association (CNDCA) has been holding meetings for days, pursuing the rightist element, Zheng Lizhai, the Director of the Gansu Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Deputy Director of the Lanzhou Municipal Committee of the CNDCA. After the Party's rectification movement began, Zheng Lizhai frantically attacked the Party. When a Guangming Daily reporter came to Lanzhou to "set fires," Zheng Lizhai volunteered to spread the fire among industrial and commercial circles.
    When the province convened a political and legal affairs symposium, Zheng Lizhai instructed members of the CNDCA to "also raise the issue of the Five-Anti Campaign," intending to instigate a reversal of the "Five-Anti" verdicts.
    Now, as this "arsonist" is exposed under everyone's accusations, he still shows no sign of bowing his head to the people and confessing his crimes.

    到处纵火妄想倒算五反账
    郑立斋丑恶面目被揭穿
    本报兰州13日电　民建兰州市委会连日举行会议，追击右派分子——甘肃省工商联主任委员、民建兰州市委副主任委员郑立斋。党的整风运动开始后，郑立斋就疯狂地向党进攻。当光明日报记者到兰州“纵火”时，郑立斋自告奋勇地在工商界中把火传点起来。
    郑立斋在省召开政法座谈会时，他指使民建的会员把“五反的问题也提出来”，打算煽动倒算“五反”账。
    现在，当这个“纵火犯”在大家的指责下露出原形时，他还丝毫没有向人民低头认罪的表现。
