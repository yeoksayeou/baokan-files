    Guangzhou Middle School Teachers Hold Meeting to Denounce Rightists
    Xie Baozhen is the Same as Ge Peiqi
    (Xinhua News Agency Dispatch) More than 100 teacher representatives from Guangzhou middle schools gathered on the 2nd to denounce the rightist element Xie Baozhen, who has consistently hated socialism.
    Xie Baozhen is a Chinese language teacher at Guangzhou No. 19 Middle School, and was formerly a reactionary lieutenant colonel officer who loyally served Chiang Kai-shek. During the period of great blooming and contending, Xie Baozhen was extremely frantic. At a school symposium, he said murderously, "If the Communist Party does not properly resolve the contradictions, the people will revolt and kill all the Semu people like during the Mongol rule." He said: "There was no Communist Party for thousands of years in history, and China did not perish," and shouted, "The land reform wronged so many good people, it must be overturned!" He slandered the Party's leadership of the anti-rightist struggle, saying, "The Communist Party has always been like this, using a fishhook to bait you."
    Teachers such as Li Er of No. 19 Middle School revealed at the meeting that Xie Baozhen has consistently hated the Communist Party, hated the new society, opposed all measures beneficial to the people, and still wholeheartedly awaits the restoration of the Kuomintang. During the land reform, he returned to his hometown to spread propaganda, saying that the Communist Party would soon relocate people, old women would be burned to death, young and middle-aged women would be forced to remarry, and young people would be used as cannon fodder, and he encouraged landlords to "resist hard, Chiang Kai-shek will return in at most five years." When someone mentioned the issue of liberating Taiwan, he said, "Liberate Taiwan? Before it is liberated, Taiwan's planes will bomb you to death."
    At the meeting, teachers refuted Xie Baozhen point by point with what they had seen and experienced over the past few years, and raised serious questions to Xie Baozhen, demanding that he thoroughly explain his reactionary motives and purposes.

    广州市中学教师集会声讨右派
    谢抱真和葛佩琦是一样货色
    本报讯　广州市中学教师代表一百多人2日集会，声讨一贯仇视社会主义的右派分子谢抱真。
    谢抱真是广州市第十九中学的语文教员，从前是忠心耿耿为蒋介石服务的反动中校军官。大放大鸣期间，谢抱真非常疯狂，在校内一个座谈会上他杀气腾腾的说，“如果共产党不好好解决矛盾，人民反起来就会像蒙古人统治时期杀色目人一样，通通杀光”。他说：“历史上几千年没有共产党，中国也没有亡”，并大叫“土改冤枉了多少好人，要翻案”，他诬蔑党领导的反右派斗争，说“共产党一向是这样，用鱼钩钓你的”。
    十九中的教师李而已等在大会上揭露说，谢抱真一贯仇视共产党，仇视新社会，反对一切有利于人民的措施，到现在还一心等待国民党复辟。土改时，他回到乡下大肆宣传，说共产党不久就要移民，老妇人要用火烧，中少年妇女要强迫改嫁，青年人要充当炮灰，并鼓动地主“努力抵抗，最多不出五年蒋介石就会回来”。有人提到解放台湾的问题，他就说，“要解放台湾？没解放，台湾飞机就先炸死你”。
    会上，教师们纷纷以自己几年来所看见的和亲身的体会来条条驳斥谢抱真，向谢抱真提出严正的质问，要他彻底交代他的反动的动机和目的。
