Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, August 21st. The editorial department of the "Stars" poetry magazine, which had been controlled by rightists such as Shi Tianhe and Liu Shahe since its inception, has recently been reorganized. The newly reorganized editorial department wrote the following in a letter to many poets across the country on the 17th: "The 'Stars' poetry magazine is now a position for counterattacking the rightists and a position for socialist poetry!"

The change in the political face of this publication can be seen from the poems published in the already typeset ninth issue. This issue contains more than ten poems that counterattack the rightists, accounting for more than a quarter of the issue, including works by workers, soldiers, and Yi ethnic youth. There are also poems praising the construction of the motherland.

In order to completely change its past reactionary political direction, the editorial department of this poetry magazine will resolutely implement the literary and artistic policy of "serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers," use the six criteria proposed by Chairman Mao to distinguish between "fragrant flowers" and "poisonous weeds," and sing loudly about socialist construction so that poetry truly becomes the battle drum of the era. At the same time, the editorial department is also preparing to carry out a series of reforms in the editorial system and other aspects.

"Stars" is a monthly poetry magazine founded in January this year by the Sichuan Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Workers. After rightists Shi Tianhe, Liu Shahe, and others infiltrated the editorial department, they colluded with Bai Hang, the director of the editorial department and a rightist within the Party, to篡改 (usurp/tamper with) the political direction of the magazine. Under the control of these rightists, "Stars" published a total of eight issues. The rightists published reactionary poetry programs in the magazine, advocating that poetry should only undertake the task of "beautifying life" and should express the "people's" seven emotions and six desires. They opposed the creative method of socialist realism and opposed singing the praises of the Party and the new society.

These rightists deliberately released poisonous weeds in the magazine. In addition to the notorious "Grass and Tree Chapter" and "Kiss" published in the inaugural issue, they also published a series of so-called "satirical poems" such as "Rising Step by Step" and "Clay Bodhisattva," which slandered the Party and the socialist system. When some poisonous weeds were exposed and criticized, they slandered and abused the Party on the one hand, while still using various methods to secretly plant "poisonous weeds." Rightist Liu Shahe and others also used pseudonyms to publish "satirical poems" that maliciously attacked the Party and revolutionary cadres. Furthermore, they specifically sought out people with rightist ideas in the selection of manuscripts, maintained close contact, and attempted to expand their camp.

Although this poetry magazine also published some good poems, they were all published reluctantly by the rightists in order to decorate the facade. According to investigation, rightist Shi Tianhe strongly opposed the publication of Chairman Mao's eighteen poems in "Stars" and only reluctantly reprinted them after repeated suggestions from the staff of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles.

The reactionary political direction of "Stars" in the previous period has already had a negative impact on poetry creation. Recently, for example, the "Stars" editorial department has also received many affected, erotic poems, as well as "satirical poems" harboring dissatisfaction with the Party.

In order to eliminate these toxins, the reorganized "Stars" editorial department has decided to carry out a thorough cleaning and is preparing to publish a series of critical articles to criticize and refute the "poisonous weeds" and reactionary poems released by the magazine in the past. It is also preparing to mobilize the vast number of readers to expose and criticize them.

    改组编辑部扭转政治方向
　　“星星”除去毒草开香花
    新华社成都21日电　自创刊以来一直被右派分子石天河、流沙河等把持的“星星”诗刊编辑部，最近已进行改组。新改组的编辑部在17日给国内许多诗人的信中，这样写道：“‘星星’诗刊现已是反击右派的阵地，是社会主义诗歌阵地！”
    从已发排的第九期所刊登的诗歌就可以看出这个刊物的政治面貌有了改变。在这一期刊有十多首反击右派的诗，占了这期刊物四分之一以上篇幅，其中有工人、战士和彝族青年的作品。此外还有歌颂祖国建设的诗篇。
    这个诗刊编辑部为了彻底改变过去反动的政治方向，将坚决贯彻“为工农兵服务”的文艺方针，以毛主席提出的六项标准来鉴别“香花”和“毒草”，放声歌唱社会主义建设，使诗歌真正成为时代的战鼓。同时，编辑部还准备在编辑制度等方面进行一系列的改革。
      “星星”是四川省文学艺术工作者联合会今年1月创办的诗歌月刊。右派分子石天河、流沙河等混入编辑部后，曾与编辑主任、党内右派分子白航互相勾结，篡改了这个刊物的政治方向。在这些右派分子把持下，“星星”共出版了八期。右派分子们在刊物中发布反动的诗歌纲领，主张诗歌只承担“美化生活”的任务，应该抒发“人民”的七情六欲。他们反对社会主义现实主义的创作方法，反对歌颂党和新社会。
    这些右派分子在刊物中故意放毒草。除创刊号发表的臭名昭著的“草木篇”和“吻”外，还发表了“步步高升”、“泥菩萨”等一系列污蔑党和社会主义制度的所谓  “讽刺诗”。在一些毒草被识破并受到批评时，他们一面对党进行污蔑和谩骂，一面仍用各种办法偷种“毒草”。右派分子流沙河等还用化名发表恶意攻击党和革命干部的“讽刺诗”。并且在选稿中专门物色具有右派思想的人，紧密联系，企图扩大其阵营。
    虽然这个诗刊也发表过一些好诗，但都是右派分子为装饰门面而被迫发表的。据检查，右派分子石天河就极力反对在“星星”刊载毛主席的十八首诗词，只是在文联工作人员多次建议后，才勉强转载的。
      “星星”前一时期反动的政治方向，已经对诗歌创作发生恶劣影响。如最近，“星星”编辑部还收到许多无病呻吟的色情诗，以及对党怀着不满情绪的“讽刺诗”等。
    为了肃清这些毒素，改组后的“星星”编辑部决定进行彻底的清理，准备陆续发表一些批评文章，对刊物过去所放出的“毒草”和反动的诗歌，进行批判和驳斥。并准备发动广大读者起来揭发和批判。
