    The Heinous and Wicked Cartoonist - Li Binsheng

    Li Binsheng is an editor in the art group of the Beijing Daily. For a long time, he has used cartoons as a weapon to conduct anti-Soviet, anti-Communist, and anti-socialist propaganda. According to revelations, Li Binsheng's reactionary thinking has been consistent. As early as 1947, he actively participated in anti-Soviet parades, and published cartoons in the reactionary "Pacific" magazine, slandering the Soviet Union, smearing the liberated areas, distorting land reform, and uglifying the Eighth Route Army. After liberation, his reactionary stance did not change, only the methods became more clever. He frequently used cartoons to attack the Party and attack activists. After the rectification movement began, he more concentratedly drew some anti-Party and anti-socialist cartoons, which were published in the May issues of the Beijing Daily and "Cartoons." His "In Certain Units" and "Parrots and Those Who Specialize in Learning Leaders' Speeches" depicted people who won awards in institutions as people without mouths, and compared cadres who acted according to the leaders' intentions to parrots, slandering the broad masses of cadres and inciting the masses to stand against the leadership. Furthermore, after inspecting work as a representative of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress, he drew a series of cartoons titled "Inspection Sketches," one of which, "One Person Holding Two Positions," not only tried his best to uglify public representatives and beautify capitalists in terms of image, but also groundlessly slandered public representatives for monopolizing everything, resulting in the failure of capitalists to exert their enthusiasm. This painting echoed the clamor of bourgeois rightists at the time about withdrawing public representatives from enterprises, and was a direct attack on the socialist transformation cause.

    At the recent meeting of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress, Li Binsheng made some superficial self-criticisms of his reactionary words and deeds, but they were very empty. The representatives demanded that he return to the Beijing Daily and the Artists Association to make a thorough confession. (Attached image)

    穷凶极恶的漫画家—李滨声
    李滨声是北京日报美术组编辑。长期以来他利用漫画作为武器，进行反苏、反共、反社会主义的宣传。据揭发，李滨声的反动思想是一贯的，早在1947年，他就积极地参加过反苏游行，在反动的“太平洋”杂志上发表漫画污蔑苏联，污蔑解放区，歪曲土地改革，丑化八路军。解放以后，他的反动立场并没有改变，只是在方法上变得更巧妙了。他经常利用漫画攻击党、攻击积极分子。整风运动开始以后，他更集中地画了一些反党反社会主义的漫画，发表在5月份北京日报和“漫画”上。他画的“在某些单位”、“鹦鹉和专学领导讲话的人”，把在机关中得奖的人画成没有嘴的人，把按领导意图办事的干部比作鹦鹉，污蔑广大干部，煽动群众与领导对立。又如，他以北京市人民代表的身份视察工作后，画了题为“视察随笔”的一组漫画，其中有一幅“一身二任”，不仅在形象上竭力丑化公股代表，美化资本家，而且无中生有地诬蔑公股代表包揽一切，致使资本家的积极性不能发挥。这幅画和当时资产阶级右派分子关于由企业中撤出公方代表的叫嚣相呼应，是对社会主义改造事业的直接进攻。
    李滨声在最近举行的北京市人民代表大会会议上，对自己的反动言行虽然作了一些检讨，但很空洞，代表们要求他回到北京日报和美术家协会作彻底交代。（附图片）
