Improve Cutting Techniques  Develop Renovation Business  Make Full Use of Scrap Materials
Tailors Exchange Experiences on Saving Cloth

(Our report) Representatives from the clothing industry of fourteen provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Liaoning, Heilongjiang and Inner Mongolia are meeting in Beijing to study methods of saving cotton cloth in production.

The meeting, which began on the 12th, focuses on the exchange of experiences in the clothing industry on saving cotton cloth. Since the beginning of spring this year, the supply of cotton cloth on the market has been relatively tight. Many sewing production cooperatives, bedding factories and clothing companies in various places are actively using methods such as improving cutting techniques, developing old-for-new renovation businesses, and making full use of scrap materials to save cotton cloth.

Many units have created good experiences in improving cutting techniques. The sewing industry in Changsha City, Hunan Province, adopted the methods of "multiple sets, multiple drawings, multiple matching" and "flexible and close material arrangement," reducing the amount of cloth used for a set of blue khaki popular clothing from 14.2 feet to 13.2 feet, saving more than 171,000 feet of cotton cloth in the first half of this year. They also saved more than 40,000 feet of cotton cloth by improving the style of clothing. The Heilongjiang Provincial Federation of Handicraft Cooperatives promoted experiences such as unified nesting, saving more than 206,000 feet of cotton cloth in the first half of the year.

The old-for-new renovation business has been launched in the sewing industry in many regions. Beijing, Tianjin, Chongqing and other cities have held old-for-new renovation exhibitions to expand publicity and exchange experiences. Some areas have also organized training classes. More than 130 main street sewing cooperative stores in Beijing have launched old-for-new renovation businesses, renovating more than 40,000 pieces of clothing in the first half of the year, saving the country more than 270,000 feet of cloth and other clothing materials, saving the masses more than 420,000 yuan, and developing the business of the cooperatives themselves. The income from old-for-new renovations of the Tianjin No. 3 Sewing Supply and Marketing Cooperative accounted for more than 70% of the total turnover in the first quarter. Many members said: Old-for-new renovation has great benefits: it saves cloth for the country, saves money for consumers, and increases income for members. It is truly a win-win-win situation!

Many units have achieved remarkable results in the utilization of scrap materials. Sewing cooperatives in Heilongjiang Province used scrap materials to make many hats, children's clothing, and mattress pads; sewing cooperatives in Guangzhou used scrap materials of less than one square inch to make handbags, which are cheap and beautiful, and the masses are scrambling to buy them. The Guangzhou No. 2 Sewing Cooperative alone produces more than 400 handbags every month using scrap materials, saving more than 600 feet of cotton cloth and increasing production by about 1,000 yuan. The clothing industry in Shanghai also spun the scattered woolen cloth strips into scarves, which are both generous and beautiful.

Most of the representatives attending this meeting are technicians with experience in saving cloth in the above aspects. Some of them also brought cutting patterns, and some brought new clothes renovated from old clothes and finished products made of scrap materials. Their meeting will end on the 21st. This meeting was convened by the preparatory committee of the All-China Handicraft Cooperative. (Attached pictures)

    改进裁剪技术  开展翻新业务  充分利用碎料
    裁缝师傅交流省布经验
    本报讯  来自北京、天津、上海、江苏、浙江、湖北、湖南、广东、河南、陕西、甘肃、辽宁、黑龙江、内蒙古等十四个省、市、自治区的服装业代表，正在北京开会研究在生产中节约棉布的方法。
    这个从12日开始举行的会议，中心内容是交流服装业节约棉布的经验。今年入春以来，市场棉布供应比较紧张。各地许多缝纫生产合作社、被服厂和服装公司，积极用改进裁剪技术、开展翻旧改新业务、充分利用碎料等办法，来节约棉布。
    许多单位在改进裁剪技术方面创造了良好的经验。湖南省长沙市缝纫业采取“多套，多画，多就”和“灵活紧密排料”的办法，把做一套蓝卡其大众服的用布数量由十四尺二寸下降到十三尺二寸，今年上半年就节约了十七万一千多尺棉布。他们还从改进服装样式着手，节约了四万多尺棉布。黑龙江省手工业合作社联合社推广了统一套裁等经验，上半年节约棉布二十万六千多尺。
    翻旧改新的业务，在许多地区的缝纫业开展起来了。北京、天津、重庆等市都举办了翻旧改新展览会，扩大宣传，交流经验。有的地区还组织了训练班。北京市一百三十多个主要街道的缝纫合作社门市部，都开展了翻旧改新业务，上半年共翻改了四万多件衣服，为国家节约布匹等衣料二十七万多尺，为群众节省四十二万多元，合作社本身也发展了业务。天津市第三缝纫供销社第一季度翻旧改新的收入占总营业额的70％以上。不少社员说：翻旧改新有很大好处：为国家省布，为消费者省钱，社员又增加了收入，真是三全其美！
    许多单位在利用碎料方面取得了显著的成绩。黑龙江省缝纫社利用碎料做了许多帽子、童装、褥垫；广州的缝衣社把不到一方寸大的碎料拼成手提包，既便宜，又美观，群众争着购买。仅广州第二缝纫社每月就利用碎料生产四百多个手提包，共节约棉布六百多尺，增产一千元左右。上海的服装业还把零碎的呢绒布条纺出来织成围巾，又大方，又好看。
    出席这个会议的代表绝大部分是有上述几方面节约布匹经验的技师。他们有的还带来了裁剪图样，有的带来了用旧衣翻成的新衣、用碎料拼成的成品。他们的会议将在21日结束。这个会议是全国手工业合作总社筹委会召开的。（附图片）
