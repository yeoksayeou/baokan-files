    Lin Peng Maliciously Slanders Previous Political Movements
    Masses List Facts and Reason for Struggle
    (Reported by this newspaper) The staff of organizations directly under the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held a conference to expose and criticize the reactionary words and deeds of Lin Peng (a Communist Party member), a theoretical instructor of the Provincial Committee's Lecturers Group. Lin Peng has consistently hated the Communist Party. Since he made mistakes and was punished during the rectification of the cadre ranks in the land reform, he has been clamoring to appeal to Chairman Mao, to "print leaflets and distribute them to the world," and "willing to be infamous for ten thousand years." During the rectification movement, he described the successive movements led by the Communist Party as tragedies that caused "disasters for cadres," saying that "movements are inseparable from dead people." He also maliciously said that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries "was 80 percent wrong, and the revolution became counter-revolution." At the recent conference of staff of organizations directly under the Provincial Committee, many people refuted Lin Peng's slander of previous political movements with reason. Zhang Bin, who worked with Lin Peng in Gaoyao County during the land reform and cadre rectification, said that Lin Peng was then the deputy secretary of the Fourth District Committee of the CPC Gaoyao County. The cadre ranks in the Fourth District were very impure, and Lin Peng himself was defending his landlord family and colluding with the landlords, using government money to jointly operate "Tanglang." Zhang Bin said that for such a seriously impure team at that time, if it was not rectified, and for a land reform leader like Lin Peng, if he was not pulled down, would it be allowed? Zhang Bin also said that a group of people did "fall" during the land reform and cadre rectification, accounting for about 5% of the original cadres in the province. Since the cadres who fell were counter-revolutionaries, class dissidents, other bad elements, and people who seriously lost their position, then what's wrong with that? What is Lin Peng's intention to feel sorry for them and seek justice for them? Liang Chao, a staff member of the Party School, focused on refuting Lin Peng's fallacy that "80 percent of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries was wrong." He said that Lin Peng was dissatisfied with the Party because he was investigated during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. Should he have been investigated at that time? Lin Peng participated in the Three People's Principles Youth League; and someone reported that he had joined the Kuomintang, but he himself did not confess. During his middle school days, he wrote a "Reflections After Reading 'China's Destiny'," praising Chiang Kai-shek's "wise and great," and won an award for it. He also participated in the Kuomintang's "Self-Defense Force" and had ambiguous relations with Kuomintang secret agents and plainclothes captains. The facts are very clear. Why shouldn't such a person be investigated at that time? What's wrong with clarifying the history of such a person? How can it be said that the revolution is being treated as counter-revolution?

    林鹏恶意诽谤历次政治运动
    群众列举事实进行说理斗争
    本报讯　中共广东省委员会直属机关工作人员最近举行大会，揭露和批判省委讲师团理论教员林鹏（共产党员）的反动言行。林鹏是一贯仇恨共产党的，自从他在土地改革整顿干部队伍时犯了错误受了处分以来，他就扬言要上诉毛主席，要“印传单散发天下”，“甘愿遗臭万年”。在整风运动期间，他把共产党领导的历次运动说成是使“干部受灾”的悲剧，说“运动与死人形影不离”。他又恶意地说肃反运动“百分之八十搞错了，革命成了反革命”。在最近举行的省委直属机关工作人员大会上，许多人据理驳斥了林鹏对历次政治运动的污蔑。土地改革整顿干部队伍时，曾经和林鹏一起在高要县工作的张斌说，当时林鹏是中共高要县第四区区委副书记，四区的干部队伍非常不纯，而林鹏本人也在为自己的地主家庭辩护，还和地主勾结在一起，用政府的钱合伙经营“塘塱”，张斌说，对于当时这样严重不纯的队伍，如果不进行整顿，对于林鹏这样的土地改革领导干部，如果不拉下来能够允许吗？张斌又说，土地改革整顿干部队伍时确实有一批人“垮台”了，在全省来说，约占原有干部5％；既然垮台的干部是些反革命分子、阶级异己分子和其他坏分子以及严重丧失立场的人，那末，这又有什么不好呢？林鹏要为他们惋惜伸冤的居心何在？党校工作人员梁超着重驳斥了林鹏“肃反百分之八十搞错了”的谬论。他说，林鹏对自己在肃反期间被审查而对党不满，究竟当时应不应该对他进行审查呢？林鹏参加过三青团；还有人检举他参加过国民党，他本人未交代。他在中学时代写了一篇“读‘中国之命运’后感”，歌颂蒋介石的“英明伟大”，因而得过奖。他还参加过国民党的“自卫队”，同国民党特务、便衣队长有过暖昧的关系。事实很明显，当时对于这样一个人为什么不应该审查呢？把这样一个人的历史审查清楚有什么不好呢？怎么能说把革命当作反革命呢？
