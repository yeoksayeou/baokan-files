Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, August 8th: Syrian Minister of State for Information and Propaganda, Akil, said on August 7th that Soviet economic aid would help Syria strengthen its policies and "defeat the imperialists' conspiracy to divide the Arabs."

Akil said at a press conference that Soviet industrial and economic aid to Syria was unconditional. He said that this aid "will not affect Syria's policy of non-alignment."

Syrian Minister of Education, Hani Sbai, said at the same press conference that Soviet-Syrian economic and technical cooperation "will enable us to sell our products and defeat the blockade imposed on us by Western countries in order to create an economic crisis in our country and oppose our current regime." He said: "This agreement also allows us to guarantee certain special budget revenues, which we cannot obtain from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, because we have rejected their loan conditions, which would force us to follow Western policies."

All newspapers in the Syrian capital published the full text of the Soviet-Syrian Moscow talks communiqué on the 7th, using headlines such as: The Syrian delegation's negotiations in Moscow achieved great results; the Soviet Union unconditionally provides Syria with everything it needs; the Soviet Union expressed its willingness to respect Syria's political and economic independence; the Soviet Union will contribute to Syria's industrialization and provide funding for these engineering projects.

"Al-Rai al-Aam" wrote that if the nationalization of the Suez Canal and the failure of the aggression against Egypt should be considered the most important events in modern Arab history, then the importance of the results of the negotiations in Moscow can be said to be second only to the above two events.

"Al-Nasr" believes that the entire Syrian nation will rejoice at the Syrian-Soviet agreement reached in Moscow, because this agreement allows Syria to look forward to the future with confidence.

    叙利亚政府人士和各报
    热烈欢迎苏联无私援助
    据新华社8日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚负责新闻和宣传的国务部长阿基勒8月7日说，苏联的经济援助将会帮助叙利亚加强政策和“击败帝国主义分子分裂阿拉伯人的阴谋”。
    阿基勒在记者招待会上说，苏联对叙利亚的工业和经济援助是无条件的。他说，这种援助“将不会影响叙利亚的不参加集团的政策”。
    叙利亚教育部长哈尼·斯拜在这个记者招待会上说，苏—叙经济技术合作“将使得我们能够出售我们的产品，击败西方国家为了在我国制造经济危机和反对我国现政权而对我们实行的封锁”。他说：“这个协定还使我们可以保证得到某些特别预算收入，这些收入是我们无法从国际复兴开发银行得到的，因为我们拒绝了他们的贷款条件，这些条件要迫使我们跟着西方的政策走。”
    叙利亚首都各报7日都刊载了苏—叙莫斯科会谈公报的全文，并且使用了这样一些标题：叙利亚代表团在莫斯科进行的谈判获得了伟大成果，苏联无条件地供给叙利亚需要的一切，苏联表示愿意尊重叙利亚政治和经济的独立，苏联将对叙利亚工业化以及为这些工程计划提供资金作出贡献。
    “舆论报”写道，如果苏伊士运河国有化和对埃及侵略的失败应当认为是阿拉伯现代史上最重要的事件，那么在莫斯科进行谈判的结果的重要性可以说是仅次于上述二事件。
    “胜利报”认为，叙利亚全国将为在莫斯科达成的叙利亚—苏联协议欢欣鼓舞，因为这个协议可以使叙利亚有信心地展望前途。
