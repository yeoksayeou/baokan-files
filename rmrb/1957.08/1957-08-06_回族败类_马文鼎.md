The Qinghai Province Ethnic Affairs Committee and the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference have held meetings for several days to denounce the rightist element, the disgrace of the Hui people - Ma Wending.

In the years since liberation, although Ma Wending has been eating the people's food and concurrently held important positions such as Deputy Director of the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, Qinghai Provincial People's Representative, and member of the Qinghai Provincial CPPCC, he has always been nostalgic for the "good old days" of pre-liberation days when he could lord it over others, and he hoped that Ma Bufang would make a comeback.

After the rectification campaign began, he gave a thumbs-up to people and said, "If you want to rectify, rectify the big ones"; then he gave a pinky-up and said, "It's no fun rectifying the small ones," inciting the masses to attack the leadership of the Party. During this period, he blatantly sought out shortcomings in the work and exaggerated them, even fabricating stories to sow discord. After the anti-rightist struggle began, Ma Wending again shouted that the pressure was too great and that hats were being thrown around indiscriminately. He also deliberately labeled active speakers as rightists and called those who criticized rightists as rightists.

Ma Wending frequently spread the idea of "the Party replacing the government" and "having the position but no authority" in the Department of Agriculture and Forestry. In fact, he usually didn't pay attention to his work. During the election of National People's Congress representatives, Ma Wending spread rumors that Ma Xingtai was chosen as a Hui representative because Ma Xingtai was incompetent and easy for the Communist Party to control. He also said to Comrade Ma Deqing: The governor is suppressing us Hui people, you should go to the head of the Qinghai Ethnic Affairs Committee and cry. He wanted to use this trick to sow discord between the Hui people and the Party and the People's Government.

Ma Wending also slandered land reform as doing bad things. He ridiculed the Party's policy of streamlining institutions and transferring cadres to lower levels as adding more masters to the people. He also dismissed the achievements of Qinghai Province in agriculture and water conservancy, saying that the Party did not pay attention to increasing the unit area yield of agriculture, and that the water conservancy work was messed up.

Ma Wending often proclaimed to people his "great achievements" in massacring the People's Liberation Army during his tenure as "Chief of Staff". He also told people, "If I had wings like an eagle, how good it would be to fly to a place where I couldn't see the Communist Party." He was full of longing for Ma Bufang and Bai Chongxi: he never forgot a medal Bai Chongxi gave him, saying that Bai Chongxi thought highly of him. Ma Wending also often boasted about Ma Bufang's "talent" in cruelly ruling the people of Qinghai, saying that Ma Bufang was "wise and decisive". Therefore, he always disobeyed the tasks assigned to him by the Communist Party. For example, in asking him to win over counter-revolutionaries, he only won over the small ones and shielded and let go of the big ones. He let go of counter-revolutionaries Tan Chengxiang, Ma Zhongyi, etc., and also gave money to help the fleeing counter-revolutionary Han Guozhi. He also felt that this was not enough and openly shouted that a group of heinous counter-revolutionaries should be released in Qinghai.

    回族败类——马文鼎
    青海省民族事务委员会和政协青海省委员会连日举行会议，声讨右派分子、回民中的败类——马文鼎。
    解放几年来，马文鼎虽然吃着人民的饭，一身兼任青海省人民代表、省政协委员和青海省农林厅副厅长等重要职务，可是他一直留恋解放前作威作福的“良辰美景”，并且希望马步芳卷土重来。
    整风开始后，他就对人翘起大拇指说：“要整就整大的”；又翘起小拇指说：“整小的没有意思”，煽动群众攻击党的领导。而他就在这个时期明目张胆地专找工作中的缺点加以扩大，甚至无中生有，播弄是非。反右派斗争开始后，马文鼎又喊压力太大、乱扣帽子。他还故意地把发言积极的人都加上右派分子的帽子，把批判右派的人说成是右派。
    马文鼎经常在农林厅散布“以党代政”、“有职无权”的空气，事实上，他平时对工作不闻不问。在选全国人民代表时，马文鼎造谣说，选马兴泰为回族代表，是因为马兴泰无才无能，共产党好掌握。他又对马德庆同志说：省长把我们回民压着呢，你去找青海民族事务委员会的负责人哭诉去。他就想用这种伎俩挑拨离间回民同党和人民政府对立。
    马文鼎还诬蔑土地改革是作坏事情。讽刺党的精简机构、下放干部的政策是替下面增加老爷。他还一笔抹杀青海省在农业和水利方面的成绩，说党不重视提高农业的单位面积产量，水利工作搞糟了。
    马文鼎常常向人宣扬他在“参谋长”任内屠杀人民解放军的“丰功伟绩”。他还对人说：“如果我有像鹰一样的翅膀，飞到看不到共产党的地方多好。”他对马步芳、白崇禧则怀念不已：念念不忘白崇禧发给他的一个奖章，说白崇禧看得起他。马文鼎还常夸耀马步芳残酷统治青海人民的“才能”，说马步芳“英明果断”。所以他一贯对共产党交给他的任务阳奉阴违。例如在让他争取反革命分子中，他只争取小的，包庇和放走大的。放走了反革命分子谭呈祥、马忠义等，还用钱接济逃亡的反革命分子韩国治。他还嫌这样作不够，公开喊着在青海应该释放一批罪大恶极的反革命分子。
