Small-Scale Competition
—A Visit to Tangshan Huaxin Textile Factory
Xiao Ling

Editor's Note: Recently, some state-owned and local state-owned enterprises in Tangshan City have launched small-scale competitions focusing on key issues in various groups, work types, and processes, between the same work types or between upstream and downstream processes. Examples include the "Winch for Column Recovery" competition in the First Coal Mining Area of Kailuan Tangshan Mine, the "No Spilled Molten Iron" competition in the steelmaking workshop of Tangshan Steel Plant, and the "Reducing Defects" competition in the weaving workshop of Huaxin Textile Factory, as introduced in this article.

These competitions have clear and specific goals, are easy to delve into, are highly comparable, and are simple and accurate to evaluate. Therefore, these competitions are popular with the masses and have good results.

Currently, many enterprise leaders only pay attention to large-scale competitions, while neglecting or even abandoning leadership over team competitions. This misplaced emphasis is inappropriate.

Stepping into the gate of the Tangshan Huaxin Textile Factory, "Good News," "Lightning Reports," and big-character posters come into view. Thousands of employees in this factory are engaged in intense small-scale competitions. In the preparing, warping, and sizing workshops, which were the first to launch small-scale competitions, red flowers are hung on the clean white walls along with celebratory posters, congratulating the workers who have achieved outstanding results in the small-scale competitions. Victory red flags are planted on the looms of the winners. Various competition instruction charts, announcing daily results, are also hung on the walls of each workshop.

The small-scale competition in Huaxin Textile Factory started in April this year. By the end of June, the entire factory, in units such as the yarn mill, cloth mill, and dyeing mill, had organized more than 30 different types of small-scale competitions based on work type and machine. After the launch of small-scale competitions, the quality of the cloth has been continuously improved. In the past, there were many defects in the cloth, and the workers in the inspection and repair sections of the finishing workshop could never finish inspecting and repairing it. Every month, the cloth that could not be inspected and repaired piled up like a mountain and could not be shipped out. After the launch of small-scale competitions, this phenomenon is no longer seen. The improvement in cloth quality can also be seen from the following figures: in April, the percentage of superior products was 98.99%, in May it was 99.83%, and in June it was 99.86%.

Huaxin Cloth Mill has had a foundation for carrying out labor competitions for several years. Small-scale competition is based on this foundation, as an important organizational means of the advanced producer movement, to achieve the goal of increasing production and practicing economy.

To carry out small-scale competitions, it is first necessary to determine what key problems need to be solved through the competition. Based on the historical data of the workshop and the opinions of the workers, the overall key for the cloth mill was determined to be reducing cloth breakage and reducing defects. And the high rate of cloth breakage and defects on the cloth are related to many processes. Therefore, time-based workers, warp workers, and loom workers all launched competitions. The competition for each process is to solve a small key problem, but these small keys revolve around solving a big key problem—improving the quality of weaving by loom workers. (The key problems solved in the competition should be of a mass nature. Some key problems need to be solved by specially organized technical forces and are not suitable for organizing competitions.)

Before the launch of small-scale competitions, workers in upstream and downstream processes and different work types often complained and argued with each other. Through small-scale competitions, workers in each work type and between upstream and downstream processes have solved the key problems in their own production, creating good production conditions for the workers in the next process. Therefore, a new atmosphere of mutual congratulatory letters has emerged in the workshop.

In order to solve the key problems in production, workers automatically organized various small-scale symposiums to exchange snippets of experience. Communist Party member Guo Ruilan taught Wu Guizhen how to operate a cop winding machine without oil stains, enabling Wu Guizhen to solve the key to eliminating defects. The leadership also summarized and promoted the advanced experience of cloth inspectors Liu Meizhen and Nie Chunlian in reducing missed inspections.

Another important factor that enables small-scale competitions to attract the participation of the majority of workers is the strong comparability of the competitions. For example, in the loom competition, a dedicated person compiles a statistical table of defect penalties for the looms every day. This statistical table is simple and clear, and each work area (equivalent to a team in other workshops) has one, which is announced once a day. At the same time, the numbers from this statistical table are also written on the small-scale competition instruction chart on the workshop wall every day. When workers come to work, they first look at the competition instruction chart. They see who has the fewest defects and who has the fewest missed inspections. As long as they find that their own and their team's results have not improved while others have, everyone automatically holds meetings to study and find the reasons. No one wants to fall behind in the small-scale competition.

This comparability must be reflected under the same conditions. For example, although they are all weaving in the looms, due to the difference between new and old machines, the new automatic yarn changing machines and the old manual yarn changing machines cannot be organized together for competition and evaluation. Similarly, even if they are new machines or old machines, but because the types of cloth woven are different, with twill and plain weave, different products cannot be compared together. Therefore, in order to make the competition comparable, extremely meticulous organizational work must be done.

### 小型竞赛——访唐山华新纺织厂

    小型竞赛
    ——访唐山华新纺织厂
    肖铃
    编者按：最近，唐山市的一些国营和地方国营企业，围绕着各小组、工种、工序的关键问题，展开了同工种或上下工序之间的小范围的竞赛。例如开滦唐山矿第一采煤区的“回柱绞车”竞赛，唐山钢厂炼钢车间的“不洒铁水”竞赛和本文所介绍的华新纺织厂织布场的“减少疵点”竞赛等等。
    这种竞赛目标明确具体，容易深入，可比性强，评比起来准确简便。因此，这种竞赛既受群众欢迎，效果也好。
    目前有许多企业领导者只注意大型竞赛，而忽视甚至放弃了对班组竞赛的领导。这种轻重倒置的做法是不妥当的。
    走进唐山华新纺织厂的大门，一张张的“捷报”“闪电报”和大字报出现在眼前，这个厂的数千职工正在开展紧张的小型竞赛。在最先开展小型竞赛的准备、布机、整理等车间，洁白的墙壁上挂着朵朵红花和贴着喜报，那是给小型竞赛中创造了突出的成绩的工人的祝贺。在优胜者的验布机和织布机上，插着胜利红旗。在各个车间墙上还挂着公布每日成绩的各种各样的竞赛指示图表。
    华新纺织厂的小型竞赛是从今年4月开始的。到6月底，全厂在纱场、布场、染场等单位已经按工种、机台组织了三十多种不同内容的小型竞赛。开展小型竞赛后，布的质量不断提高。过去，布疵点多，整理间验布和修布的工人老也验不完、修不完。每月验修不完的布堆得像山一样高，不能出厂。开展小型竞赛后，再也见不到这种现象了。布的质量提高还可从以下数字看出：4月份上等品占98.99％，5月份占99.83％，6月份占99.86％。
    华新布场已有几年开展劳动竞赛的基础，小型竞赛就是在这基础上，作为先进生产者运动的一个重要组织手段、以实现增产节约为目的而开展起来的。
    开展小型竞赛，首先要确定通过竞赛解决什么关键问题。根据车间的历史资料和工人们的意见，确定了布场的总的关键是不拆布和减少疵点。而布机拆布多和布上疵点多，又联系到很多个工序。于是计时工、经纱工、布机工都开展了竞赛。每一个工序的竞赛都是为了解决一个小的关键，但这些小关键又围绕着解决一个大的关键——提高布机工人织布的质量。（在竞赛中解决的关键应具有群众性。有些关键需专门组织技术力量来解决，不适于组织竞赛。）
    小型竞赛开展前，上下工序与不同工种之间的工人经常相互埋怨、扯皮。通过小型竞赛，各工种和上下工序间的工人都把自己生产中的关键问题解决了，为下一道工序的工人创造了良好的生产条件。因而车间出现了互相写信道贺的新气象。
    为了解决生产中的关键问题，工人们自动地组织各种小型座谈会来交流点滴经验。党员郭瑞兰把着手教给吴桂珍落筒子不出油纱的操作，使吴桂珍解决了出疵点的关键。领导上也总结和推广了验布工人刘美珍、聂春莲的减少漏验分的先进经验。
    小型竞赛能以吸引广大工人参加的另一个重要因素，就是竞赛的可比性强。像布机间的竞赛，每天有专人做布机疵点处分统计表，这种统计表简单明确，一目了然，每工区（相当于别的车间小组）有一张，每天公布一次。同时，每天还把这个统计表的数字写在车间墙上的小型竞赛的指示图表上。工人一上班，首先看竞赛指示图表。看谁的疵点最少，谁漏验分最少。只要发现自己和小组的成绩没有提高而别人提高了，大家就自动开会研究找原因，谁也不愿意落在小型竞赛的后面。
    这种可比性必须在相同的条件下才能体现出来。例如，在布机间虽然都是织布的，由于机器有新老的区别，自动换纱的新车与人工换纱的老车就不能一起组织竞赛、评比。同样是新车或老车，但因织的布品种不一样，有斜纹、平纹之分，不同产品也不能在一起比。因此，要使得竞赛具有可比性，要作极细致的组织工作。
