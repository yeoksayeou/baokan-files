Xinhua News Agency, London, August 13th: TASS reports: Soviet representative Zorin stated at the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee meeting on August 13th that despite five months of discussions, the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee has not yet been able to announce that it has reached any agreement on any of the basic issues of disarmament.

    Zorin spoke about the attitude of Western countries towards the proposals put forward by the Soviet delegation, which included a broad disarmament program and specific procedures for achieving such disarmament and measures to supervise its implementation. He pointed out that Western countries intend to maintain large armed forces under the pretext of the special obligations they undertake throughout the world. Zorin pointed out that the United States is effectively hindering the resolution of the issue of reducing conventional armaments and armed forces.

    Zorin pointed out: Western countries are currently issuing statements saying that they are willing to reduce the armed forces of the United States and the Soviet Union to a level of 1.1 million to 1.7 million men. However, their agreement to either of these levels is conditional on the resolution of major political issues. Zorin said, is it not obvious that making the resolution of one issue dependent on the resolution of another is to complicate the issue and make both issues impossible to resolve?

    Zorin said that the Soviet Union has already announced that it is prepared to consider the US proposal to reduce armed forces in three stages. At the same time, Zorin pointed out that such an approach could only be accepted after countries have signed an agreement on the reduction of armed forces. However, to date, Western countries have not provided a clear, affirmative response to this issue. He said: There should be no illusions that we are about to reach an agreement on the reduction of the armed forces of various countries.

    Zorin concluded that it is clear from the above that it is the attitude of Western countries that is hindering the reaching of an agreement on the reduction of armed forces, armaments, and military budgets.

    裁军会议五个月无成就
    佐林指责西方国家拖延谈判
    据新华社14日讯　据塔斯社伦敦13日讯：苏联代表佐林在8月13日联合国裁军小组委员会的会议上说，联合国裁军小组委员会尽管进行了五个月的讨论，但直到今天为止还不能宣布它在裁军问题中的任何一个基本问题上已经达成某种协议。
    佐林谈到了西方国家对于苏联代表团所提出的包含一项广泛的裁军方案以及实现这种裁军的具体程序和监督其履行的措施的建议的态度，他指出，西方国家打算在它们在全世界所承担的特别义务的借口下，保持大量的武装部队。佐林指出，美国实际上在阻碍裁减常规军备和武装部队问题的解决。
    佐林指出：西方国家目前发表声明说，它们愿意把美国和苏联的武装部队裁减到一百十万人到一百七十万人的水平。但是，它们对这两个水平中任何一个水平的同意都要以重大政治问题的解决作为条件。佐林说，使一个问题的解决要看另外一个问题的解决而定是要使问题复杂化，并且使两个问题都无法解决，这难道不明显吗？
    佐林说，苏联已经宣布过，它准备考虑美国提出的关于分三个阶段来裁减武装部队的建议。同时，佐林指出，只有当各国就裁减武装部队问题签订一项协定以后才能接受这样的做法。但是，到现在为止，西方国家对这个问题还没有提出一个明确的、肯定的答复。他说：不应当有这种幻想，认为我们就要就裁减各国的武装部队问题达成协议了。
    佐林最后说，从上述情况中可以明显地看出，阻挠在裁减武装部队、军备和军事预算问题上达成协议的是西方国家的态度。
