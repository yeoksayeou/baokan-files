　　Mid-Autumn Mooncakes to be Available in Six Major Cities Including Beijing
    This year, the supply of mooncakes for the Mid-Autumn Festival in six cities including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, and Shenyang will reach 10 million jin. Calculated by population, this is about half a jin per person, roughly the same as last year.
    To ensure that people can enjoy delicious Mid-Autumn Festival mooncakes, the local non-staple food commercial departments made arrangements and deployments as early as a month ago. Relevant units allocated grain, oil, and sugar specifically for making mooncakes. Ingredients for mooncakes, such as walnut kernels, melon seeds, lotus seeds, sesame, black dates, and candied plums, were also prepared in advance. Production has already started in various places since mid-August. Shanghai began supplying the market on August 20, and the rest of the cities will supply in large quantities in early September.
    The quality of mooncakes produced in various places this year is no less than last year, and the variety of flavors retains the traditional special flavors. Shanghai produces various styles of mooncakes, including Beijing, Jiangsu, Ningbo, Cantonese, and Chaozhou styles; Guangzhou produces more than 40 varieties; Shenyang has increased from two varieties last year to more than ten. At the same time, various places have also increased the supply of savory and delicious pepper and salt mooncakes to meet people's needs.　·Zhu Youren·

　　Dangshan Pears and Xiao County Grapes Transported and Sold to Various Places
    The famous products of Xuzhou area, "Dangshan Pears" and "Xiao County Grapes," have begun to be transported and sold to the north and south.
    Over the years, pears and grapes from Xuzhou area have been sold to major cities south of the Yangtze River, such as Shanghai.
    This year, "Dangshan Pears" and "Xiao County Grapes" have once again achieved a bumper harvest. In order to ensure that all the fruit farmers' products are sold in a timely manner, the Xuzhou City Vegetable Company has opened up sales channels in the Northeast. Since mid-month, more than 30,000 jin of grapes and pears have been sold to Shenyang, Changchun, and Harbin every day.　·Bai Feng·

    Henan Harvests Fish Larvae for Export
    Henan Province Native Produce Export Company is purchasing fish larvae in Kaifeng, Xuchang, and other places to supply the foreign market.
    Fish larvae are small red worms that grow in stagnant water pits and are an important feed for goldfish. They have long been a popular commodity in capitalist countries' markets. They reproduce very quickly, and after being harvested, they are full again in a day or two. May to September each year is the harvest season. The harvested fish larvae can be exported after being dried.　·Xinhua News Agency·

    A Type of Chicken to be Vigorously Promoted
    The chickens of Dalun Village, Cilun Township, Shouguang County, Shandong Province, are famous throughout the country. This type of chicken is particularly large, weighing about seven jin each, has strong disease resistance, is gentle in temperament, has tender and fatty meat, and lays particularly large eggs.
    This is a rare breed of chicken in our country, with a history of more than 100 years. In the past, local farmers, in order to maintain the special characteristics of this chicken, never sold live chickens or fresh eggs. Even when giving gifts to daughters who married out of the village, they would boil the eggs first. In recent years, breeding has been expanded. The city service departments have decided to vigorously protect and promote this breed of chicken.　·Mu Qing·

    Tender and Delicious Guixian Lotus Root
    In early August, when Guixian lotus root was on the market in large quantities, I went to Sanhe Township, which has the most lotus root ponds. Sanhe Township has more than 180 mu of lotus root ponds. According to the estimated yield of the commune members, it is estimated that each mu of lotus root pond can produce 2,000 jin of lotus root this year.
    The quality of lotus root in Sanhe Township is very good. When cooked, it tastes delicious and crispy, and it also has the characteristic of becoming more鲜红red and beautiful in color as it is cooked. Lotus root is the raw material for making lotus root powder. The lotus root in Sanhe Township has a very firm texture. Every ten jin of raw lotus root can make one jin of pure powder. The powder is smooth and red, with a delicious and refreshing taste.
    The sales channels for lotus root in Sanhe Township are very wide. Last year, the Guixian Trading Company purchased a batch and transported it to Hong Kong and domestic cities such as Wuhan and Wuzhou. In order to meet the needs of the majority of consumers, the planting area of lotus root in this township will continue to expand.　·Zhu Yi·

    一种要大力推广的鸡
    山东寿光县慈伦乡大伦村的鸡，在全国闻名。这种鸡个子特别大，每支约重七斤，抗疫力很强，性情温和，肉肥嫩，蛋特别大。
    在我国这是一种稀有的鸡种，相传已有一百多年的历史。过去，当地农民为了保持这种鸡的特权，从来不肯出售活鸡和鲜蛋，就是给嫁出门的姑娘送礼，都要把鸡蛋煮熟了。这几年已经扩大配种。城市服务部门决定要大力保护和推广这个鸡种。　·穆青·
    肥嫩的贵县莲藕
    8月初，贵县的莲藕大量上市的时候，我到了种藕最多的三合乡。三合乡有一百八十多亩藕塘。根据社员们的估产，估计今年每亩藕塘能够产藕二千斤。
    三合乡的莲藕质量很好，将它煮熟来吃，味美而脆，同时有越煮色泽越鲜红美观的特点。莲藕是制造藕粉的原料。三合乡的莲藕质地很坚，每十斤生藕可以制一斤纯粉，粉色光滑带红，味美爽口。
    三合乡的莲藕销路很广，去年贵县贸易公司收购了一批运往香港和国内的武汉、梧州等城市。为了满足广大消费者的需要，这个乡的莲藕种植面将继续扩大。　·朱艺·
