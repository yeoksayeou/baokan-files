    The Era of Literature's Rising Red Sun
    Wen Junquan
    Since liberation, in the short span of eight years, the Party has achieved great successes in all its undertakings. This is a fact that no one can deny. Some say that the literary and art front is not like this, that there are few new talents and little achievement. But this is a claim that denies the facts and is not worth refuting.
    In March 1956, Beijing held the National Conference of Young Literary Creators. Nearly four hundred young authors attended this conference. As far as I know, few of these four hundred people had published articles in the old society. Are these not new people cultivated by the Party? The anthology of young literary creations published in 1956 also showcased this achievement. The works of fifty young authors were selected for the anthology, and the vast majority of these works were of a certain standard in terms of ideology and artistry. Did anything like this ever happen in the old society? Take our Anshan for example. In the old society, what literature could we workers even talk about? But now, the annual workers' literary and artistic performances involve hundreds of programs. Many workers who had never seen a play in the old society have now become amateur actors beloved by the masses. Currently, Anshan's workers boast over a hundred amateur authors, and no fewer than fifty of them possess a certain level of creative skill. The vast majority of them are workers. How could such a thing have been imagined in the old society? If this is not due to the leadership of the Party, to whom else can it be attributed?
    I am an amateur author. In the past few years, I have written about twenty short stories, two one-act plays, and some performance materials. Although my writing is not very good, I have always been encouraged. Last year, I was even admitted as a member of the Shenyang Writers Association branch. Over the past few years, I have deeply felt that the Party is meticulously and wholeheartedly cultivating new talents on the literary and art front. Only the Party can make our literary cause flourish.
    In the old society, I was a railway worker. I studied for six years and worked for six years. At the time of liberation, I couldn't even write a letter properly. Later, I read several novels and developed a love for literature, and I also had the idea of writing about my own life. But what did I know? Could I write literary works based solely on desire? Thinking of this, I cannot help but sincerely thank the Party. Without the Party, I could not have obtained so many learning opportunities and received so much help. My literary creation is like a child just learning to walk, with someone supporting me every step of the way. Starting in 1953, I participated in the amateur literature training class held by the Shenyang Writers Association branch, and then I participated in the amateur literature research group held by the Shenyang branch. After 1955, Anshan also held amateur literature training classes and amateur literature research groups. I am currently studying in the amateur literature group. Writers Cao Ming and Yu Min are our teachers, giving us lectures, helping us revise our drafts, and caring about the problems we encounter in our creations. In addition, almost every writer who has come to Anshan has given us lectures. They shared their valuable experiences with us, told us useful knowledge, and gave us sincere love and deep concern. If this were not today, but in the old society, could such a thing have happened in a dream?
    Yes, we have not yet produced great poets like Li Bai and Du Fu, and immortal works with a high degree of ideological and artistic quality have not yet appeared in large numbers. However, we should also know that Cao Xueqin spent ten years of blood and tears writing about his declining family and a society that had stagnated for hundreds of years; how many decades did it take for *Water Margin* to go from legend to written work? History will make its judgment. Our era is not only a spring for industry and agriculture, but also the morning of literature's rising red sun.

    文学的红日东升的时代
    温俊权
    解放以来，在短短的八年时间内，党在各项工作中都取得了伟大的成就。这是事实，任何人都抹杀不了的。有人说，文艺战线上不是这样，而是新人寥落，没有什么成绩。但这是抹杀事实的说法，不值一驳的。
    在1956年3月，北京召开了全国青年文学创作者会议。参加这次会议的青年作者达四百人之多。据我所知，这四百人当中，没有几个人在旧社会发表过文章的。难道这不是党培养出来的新人吗？在1956年出版的青年文学创作选集，也展示了这个成就。有五十名青年作者的作品被选入了选集，其中绝大部分作品在思想性艺术性上，是有一定水平的，在旧社会里有过这样的事情吗？就拿我们鞍山来说吧，在旧社会里，我们工人还谈得到什么文艺呢？但是现在，每年一次的职工文艺会演，总有数百个节目参加。很多工人在旧社会都没看过戏，今天却成了群众爱戴的业余演员。现在鞍山职工中，已拥有一百余名业余作者，其中具有一定创作水平的不下五十人，他们绝大部分是工人。这样的事情在旧社会怎么能想像呢？这不归功于党的领导，又能归功于谁呢？
    我是一个业余作者，几年来写了二十来篇短篇小说，两个独幕剧本，还有一些演唱材料。虽然我写的很不好，但是我一直受到鼓励，去年还被吸收为沈阳作协分会的会员。几年来，使我深深的感到，党在培养文艺战线上的新人，是无微不至，倾尽心血的。只有党才能使我们文艺事业繁荣起来。
    在旧社会里，我是一个铁路工人。读了六年书，做了六年工。解放当时，我连一封信都写不通顺。后来，我读了几本小说，对文学产生了爱好，也有把自己的生活写出来的念头。但是，我懂什么呢？难道只凭愿望就能写出文学作品吗？想到这里，我不能不由衷的感谢党，没有党我不可能获得这么多的学习机会，得到这么多的帮助。我的文学创作，就像一个刚学走路的孩子一样，每一步都有人扶着我。从1953年开始，我便参加了沈阳作协分会举办的业余文学讲习班学习，然后又参加了沈阳分会举办的业余文学研究小组。1955年以后，我们鞍山也举办了业余文学讲习班和业余文学研究小组。我现在就在业余文学小组学习。作家草明、于敏同志是我们的老师，给我们讲课，帮助我们改稿，关心我们在创作上所遇到的问题。除此以外，凡到鞍山来过的作家，几乎都给我们讲过课。他们把宝贵的经验告诉我们，有益的知识告诉我们，还给了我们诚挚的爱护，深切的关怀。如果不在今天，而是在旧社会，在梦里能遇到这样的事情吗？
    是的，我们还没有出现李白、杜甫那样伟大的诗人，高度的思想性艺术性的不朽的作品出现的还不多。但是，我们也应该知道，曹雪芹写他落生的家庭和停滞了数百年的社会，还花费了十年的血和泪；水浒传从传说到写成作品何止是数十年？历史将作出鉴定，我们的时代，不仅是工农业的春天，也是文学的红日东升的早晨。
