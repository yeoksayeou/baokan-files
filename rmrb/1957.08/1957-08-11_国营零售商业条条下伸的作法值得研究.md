    The Practice of Extending State-Owned Retail Commerce Vertically Deserves Study
    Li Shihe, Chu Dechun
    At the beginning of this year, various provinces and autonomous regions, based on the State Council's "Regulations on Adjusting the Division of Labor and Organizational Structure of Several Commercial Departments," adjusted the rural commercial institutions. Currently, state-owned commercial departments in several counties of more than a dozen provinces and autonomous regions, such as Hebei, Shandong, Hunan, and Guangdong, have taken over the business of industrial products and non-staple foods originally operated by supply and marketing cooperatives in rural areas (mainly market towns). Although this change is still under trial in most areas (only a few areas have fully implemented it), there are many problems worth studying in terms of the effect of the vertical extension of state-owned commerce.
    First of all, the vertical extension of state-owned commercial retail institutions has caused inconvenience for farmers to buy and sell goods. We know that the supply and marketing cooperative was originally a comprehensive commercial department integrating purchase and sale, so farmers found it very convenient. For example, in the past, farmers could sell eggs at the supply and marketing cooperative and promptly exchange them for what they needed; now that purchase and sale are separated, the business method that farmers liked, "eggs for salt, no money seen," has been cancelled. Secondly, farmers generally are used to buying daily necessities such as oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, and tea together, but now they have to run to a different shop for each item. They have to run back and forth several times to buy things once. No wonder some farmers complained: "This is really tiring!" The rural market is generally "busy on market days, idle on non-market days." In the past, the supply and marketing cooperative operated as a single unit, and could transfer some administrative staff and salespersons from village distribution stores to support each other. Now that state-owned commercial institutions have been extended, this condition no longer exists, so it is very idle on non-market days, and too busy on market days.
    From the perspective of economic accounting, the vertical extension of state-owned commercial retail institutions is also uneconomical. With more institutions, there will inevitably be more personnel, and the workload will be relatively reduced. For example, Liu Village in Dafeng County, Jiangsu Province, has only more than 4,000 people, but there are supply and marketing cooperatives and aquatic products, food, department stores, specialty, and textile companies. Most of the staff in these units have nothing to do. The food purchasing station in Bilian District, Yongjia County, Zhejiang Province, only purchased three eggs one day. In the first quarter of this year, the average workload per person in the non-staple food store in Zhuya District, Yidu County, Shandong Province, decreased by 30% compared with the same period last year when the supply and marketing cooperative was operating. As a result, commercial profits have generally decreased. For example, in Niulanshan, Liqiao and Zhangzhen in Shunyi County, Hebei Province, the estimated business volume in 1957 will only increase by 6% compared with the same period last year, while the expenditure will increase by one-third compared with the same period last year, and the profit will be reduced by half compared with last year.
    There are also more disputes between state-owned commercial institutions and supply and marketing cooperatives than in the past, mainly due to improper allocation of goods. For best-selling goods, the company always wants to sell more itself, so it is unwilling to wholesale more, or even not wholesale to the supply and marketing cooperative. In Cangzhen, Cangxian County, Hebei Province, the company's store and the joint venture store led by the company have dozens of kinds of goods in stock, while the supply and marketing cooperative's store is out of stock.
    These situations show that the practice of vertically extending state-owned commercial retail institutions violates the operating rules of the rural market, is not in line with the principle of running enterprises diligently and thriftily, and causes a huge waste of human, material, and financial resources.

    国营零售商业条条下伸的作法值得研究
    黎世和　储德淳
    今年年初，各省、自治区根据国务院“关于调整若干商业部门经营分工和组织机构的规定”，对农村商业机构进行了调整。目前，河北、山东、湖南、广东等十几个省、自治区的若干县国营商业部门分别在农村（主要是集镇）接办了原由供销社经营的工业品、副食品等业务。虽然，多数地区的这一改变仍在试验之中（只有少数地区全面铺开），但就国营商业条条下伸的效果来看，有很多问题是值得研究的。
    首先是，国营商业零售机构条条下伸以后，造成了农民购销不便。我们知道，供销社原来是一种购销合一的综合性商业部门，因此农民感到很方便。比如，过去农民在供销社卖出了鸡蛋就能够及时地换回自己所需要的东西；现在购销分家，农民喜欢的“鸡蛋换盐，两不见钱”的经营方式取消了。其次，一般农民买油、盐、酱、醋、茶等日用商品都习惯在一起买，现在买一样东西就要跑一家铺子，买一次东西要来来回回的跑好几次，难怪有些农民不满地说：“这真折腾人！”农村市场一般是“逢集忙，背集闲”，过去供销社一家经营，可以抽调一些行政人员和乡村分销店的营业员互相支援，现在国营商业机构下伸后，这种条件没有了，于是形成背集很闲，逢集日就忙不过来。
    从经济核算上看，国营商业零售机构下伸，也是不合算的。机构一多，人员势必多，工作量相对地减少了。如江苏大丰县刘庄只有四千多人，就有供销社和水产、食品、百货、专卖、纺织品等公司。这些单位的工作人员大多无事可做。浙江永嘉县碧莲区食品收购站有一天只收购了三个鸡蛋。山东益都县朱崖区副食品商店今年一季度每人平均工作量，比去年同期供销社经营时下降30％。由此，商业利润普遍减少。比如河北省顺义县牛栏山、李桥及张镇三地，预计1957年经营额比去年同期只增加6％，而费用额比去年同期要增加三分之一，利润将比去年减少一半。
    国营商业机构与供销社之间扯皮的事也比过去增多，主要是货源分配不当。凡是畅销货，公司总想自己多卖，因此不愿多批发，甚至不批发给供销社。河北沧县沧镇有好几十种商品，公司门市部和公司领导的合营商店都有货，而供销社的门市部则脱销。
    这些情况说明，国营商业零售机构条条下伸的做法，既违反了农村市场经营规律，又不符合勤俭办企业的方针，造成人力、物力、财力的巨大浪费。
