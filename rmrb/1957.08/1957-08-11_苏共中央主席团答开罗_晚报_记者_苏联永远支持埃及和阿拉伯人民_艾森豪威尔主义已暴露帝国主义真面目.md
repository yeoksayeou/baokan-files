Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, August 10th: The Cairo "Evening News" published on August 8th the response of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to questions posed by a reporter from the newspaper. The reporter stated that his questions were submitted to the Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU through Kotov, Executive Secretary of the Soviet Peace Defense Committee. Suslov and Kuusinen, Secretaries of the Central Committee of the CPSU, provided answers during their meeting with him.

Regarding the Soviet Union's policy towards Arab countries, the response stated that the Soviet Union's policy towards Arab countries, particularly Egypt, has always been, and will always be, a frank, sincere policy of support. The Soviet government's decisive policy of friendship and peace towards Arab countries is in line with the interests of all parties. The Soviet Union, with sincere affection for all peoples, hopes that all countries in the region will achieve national independence and economic development and prosperity.

Regarding the Soviet Union's economic assistance to Egypt and Arab countries, the response stated that the Soviet Union is now helping, and will always help, Egypt and Arab countries. To date, all assistance and economic relations between us and Egypt and the Arab countries have developed smoothly in the spirit of friendship and mutual respect for each other's internal affairs.

Regarding the United States' policy in the Middle East, the response stated that the United States has announced the "Eisenhower Doctrine" in an attempt to rule and control Arab countries through the "Eisenhower Doctrine." The events in Jordan have thoroughly exposed the imperialist face behind the "Eisenhower Doctrine" to the world. American monopoly capital seeks to seize this strategically important region by depriving Arab countries of their newly acquired national independence and even hindering the development of national movements in the region.

In response to the question of the Soviet Union's attitude towards the United States joining the Baghdad Pact Military Committee, the response stated, "The purpose of the United States' participation in the (Baghdad) Pact is to strengthen the activities of this pact and to strengthen this aggressive bloc which revealed its true colors during the imperialist aggression against Egypt."

Regarding the issue of Israel, the response stated that the Israeli government's policy of provoking and causing disputes on the armistice line between Arab countries and Israel does not ease the tense situation in the Middle East. This policy must be resolutely stopped.

Regarding the situation in the Middle East, the response stated: The Soviet Union has announced important steps to prevent the threats facing this region. This step is to resolve various issues in the region and not to interfere in the internal affairs of the region through international guarantees of non-use of force. The unity of the Arab countries is a decisive weapon against imperialism and war.

The Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU also answered questions regarding the relationship between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, as well as the Soviet Union's attitude towards the United Nations Emergency Force in the Middle East.

    苏共中央主席团答开罗“晚报”记者
    苏联永远支持埃及和阿拉伯人民
    艾森豪威尔主义已暴露帝国主义真面目
    新华社开罗10日电　开罗“晚报”8月8日刊载了苏联共产党中央委员会主席团对这家报纸记者的谈话。这位记者说，他的问题是通过苏联保卫和平委员会执行书记科托夫向苏共中央委员会主席团提出的，苏共中央委员会书记苏斯洛夫和库西宁在接见他的时候对这些问题作了回答。
    这个回答在提到苏联对阿拉伯国家的政策时说，苏联对阿拉伯国家、特别是对埃及的政策一向是，并且将永远是坦率诚挚的政策和支持的政策。苏联政府奉行的对阿拉伯国家友好和和平的决定性的政策，是符合各方面的利益的。苏联怀着对各国人民的诚挚的感情，希望这个地区各国都获得民族独立和经济的发展繁荣。
    关于苏联对埃及和阿拉伯国家的经济援助，这个回答说，苏联现在正在帮助，而且将始终帮助埃及和阿拉伯国家。到目前为止，我们同埃及和阿拉伯国家之间的一切援助和经济关系本着友好和互相尊重各国内政的精神得到了顺利的发展。
    这个回答在提到美国在中东的政策时说，美国宣布了“艾森豪威尔主义”，是想要通过“艾森豪威尔主义”来统治和控制阿拉伯国家。约旦事件已经向全世界彻底地暴露了“艾森豪威尔主义”后面的帝国主义真面目。美国垄断资本想通过剥夺阿拉伯国家新取得的民族独立、以至阻碍这个地区民族运动发展的办法，来攫取这个具有战略意义的地区。
    在答复关于苏联对美国加入巴格达条约军事委员会的态度时，这个回答说，“美国参加（巴格达）条约的目的是要加强这个条约的活动，以及打算加强这个在帝国主义侵略埃及期间现出原形的侵略集团。”
    这个回答在提到以色列问题时说，以色列政府奉行的在阿拉伯国家和以色列之间的停战线上进行挑衅和引起纠纷的政策，并不能缓和中东的紧张局势。必须坚决制止这种政策。
    关于中东的局势，这个回答说：苏联曾经宣布了防止这个地区面临的威胁的重要步骤。这个步骤就是由国际保证不使用武力来解决这个地区的各种问题和不干涉这个地区的内政。阿拉伯国家的团结是反对帝国主义和战争的决定性的武器。
    苏共中央主席团也回答了关于苏联和其他社会主义国家的关系以及苏联对在中东的联合国紧急部队的态度的问题。
