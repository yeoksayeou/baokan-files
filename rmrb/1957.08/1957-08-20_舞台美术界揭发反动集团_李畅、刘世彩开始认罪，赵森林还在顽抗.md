Xinhua News Agency, 18th. The anti-Party conspiracy activities of the right-wing small group headed by rightists Li Chang and Zhao Senlin in the stage art circles were exposed at the anti-rightist debate jointly held by the Chinese Dramatists Association and the Chinese Artists Association on the 16th and 17th.

At the meeting, it was revealed that Li Chang, a lecturer in the Stage Art Department of the Central Academy of Drama, Zhao Senlin, the performance captain of the General Political Department's Cultural Troupe, Liu Shicai, the stage designer of the General Political Department's Song and Dance Troupe, and Xu Tingmin, a lecturer at the Central Academy of Drama, formed a right-wing small group during the rectification campaign. They incited the national stage art circles to attack the Ministry of Culture and the Cultural Department of the Military Commission, attempting to abolish the Party's leadership in the stage art circles.

These right-wing elements took advantage of the three "voicing" and "airing opinions" symposiums jointly held by the Chinese Dramatists Association and the Chinese Artists Association to make inflammatory speeches, describing the new society as completely dark. They said that stage art workers were suffering "inhuman treatment" and provoked the relationship between directors and stage art staff as one of ruler and ruled. Liu Shicai even fabricated that he often worked continuously for twenty to forty hours. Li Chang slanderously said that the bureaucracy of the Ministry of Culture had put the stage art circles in a "desperate situation" and would "harm future generations." He maliciously provoked the unity of the drama circles, saying that stage art workers were the "sixth finger" and were "labor reform teams" "similar to prisoners." He openly called for so-called "creative freedom," "human rights," and "social status" for stage art workers. They spread rumors that during the performance of "Ten Thousand Waters and a Thousand Mountains," "one comrade's lumbar spine was split, one had a perforated stomach, one had a stomach ulcer, and one had pulmonary infiltration..." These inflammatory remarks misled some people who were unaware of the truth at the time. In fact, these malicious slanders were deliberately fabricated by the right-wing elements, as proven on the spot by the so-called four "victims."

Right-wing elements Li Chang and Xu Tingmin also incited students from the Central Academy of Drama, setting the "fire" in the school. The students openly demanded to the Party organization that a large meeting be held and that a condolence group be organized to visit the "victims" in the General Political Department's Cultural Troupe. They shouted to take action immediately and draft an appeal. Seeing that the climax of "setting the fire" had arrived, Li Chang and Zhao Senlin jointly planned to hold an anti-Party and anti-socialist oath-taking rally—the so-called "Teachers and Students Congress" of the Stage Art Department of the Central Academy of Drama. They described this meeting as a "meeting to denounce Chen Qitong." At this conference, Li Chang and Zhao Senlin used the dissatisfaction of some stage art workers with their work to make inflammatory speeches, slandering the achievements of the drama "Ten Thousand Waters and a Thousand Mountains" as "the product of blood and fire" and "the result of a tyrant whipping slaves." When the deceived masses were "incited," Li Chang added fuel to the fire, saying: "The minutes of the meeting should be printed and distributed to various places, we must resolutely fight against the Ministry of Culture, we must organize theoretical teams, and if necessary, we can take to the streets (to make great democracy)," attempting to create a "small Hungarian incident."

After that meeting, Li Chang, Zhao Senlin, and student representatives who were temporarily deceived went to the Chinese Dramatists Association and the Drama Newspaper Office, requesting the Association to send the appeal to theaters across the nation and threatening the editorial department of the Drama Newspaper to publish the appeal. Li Chang also took advantage of the Central Academy of Drama's lax mailing system and legally sent the appeal to various places across the country.

Li Chang, Zhao Senlin, and others also secretly planned to establish a "Stage Art Design Company" to dismantle the design personnel of various Beijing theaters and pull them into the so-called "design company," attempting to usurp the leadership of the stage art circles and break away from the Party's leadership.

At the anti-rightist debate attended by more than nine hundred drama and art workers, right-wing elements Li Chang and Liu Shicai have begun to lower their heads and confess their crimes in the face of ironclad facts. Right-wing element Zhao Senlin is still trying to resist, causing great indignation among the attendees. This debate will continue.

    舞台美术界揭发反动集团
    李畅、刘世彩开始认罪，赵森林还在顽抗
    新华社18日讯　舞台美术界以右派分子李畅、赵森林为首的右派小集团的反党阴谋活动，在中国戏剧家协会和中国美术家协会16、17日联合召开的反右派辩论会上被揭发出来了。
    会上集中揭露了中央戏剧学院舞台美术系讲师李畅、总政文工团演出队长赵森林、总政歌舞团的舞台设计刘世彩和中央戏剧学院讲师徐廷敏等，在整风中结成右派小集团，煽动全国舞台美术界向文化部和军委文化部进攻，企图取消党在舞台美术界的领导。
    这些右派分子借中国戏剧家协会和中国美术家协会联合举行的三次“鸣”、“放”座谈会，作了煽动性发言，把新社会描写成漆黑一团。说舞台美术工作者都受着“非人的待遇”，挑拨导演与舞台美术工作人员的关系是统治与被统治者的关系。刘世彩还无中生有地说他经常连续工作二十小时到四十小时。李畅诬蔑地说，文化部官僚主义使舞台美术界处于“绝境”，将要“祸及后代”。他恶毒地挑拨戏剧界的团结说：舞台美术工作者是“第六个手指头”，舞台美术工作者是“重囚相类”的“劳改队”，并公开提出要争取舞台美术工作者的所谓“创作自由”、“人的权利”、“社会地位”等。他们造谣说，在“万水千山”的演出时“有一个同志腰椎劈裂，一个胃穿孔，一个得了胃溃疡，一个肺浸润……”。这些煽动性言论当时迷惑了一些不明真象的人。其实这些恶毒的诬蔑经所谓四个“被害者”当场证明，都是右派分子故意捏造的。
    右派分子李畅、徐廷敏又煽起中央戏剧学院学生，把“火”点到学校里。学生们公然向党组织提出要开大会并要组织慰问团去总政文工团慰问“被害者”。并高呼立即行动起来，起草呼吁书。李畅见“点火”的高潮已到，便与赵森林共同策划，召开反党反社会主义的誓师大会——所谓中央戏剧学院舞台美术系“师生大会”。他们把这个会说成是“声讨陈其通”大会。在这次大会上，李畅、赵森林利用部分舞台美术工作者对工作的不满情绪，进行了煽动性的发言，把话剧“万水千山”排演的成绩诬蔑是“血与火的产物”，是“暴君鞭打奴隶的结果”。当被蒙蔽的群众被“煽动”起来时，李畅又火上加油地说：“要把大会记录印发各地，要与文化部坚决斗争，要组织理论队伍，必要时可以上街（闹大民主）”，企图制造“小匈牙利事件”。
    李畅、赵森林及一时被蒙蔽的学生代表等在那次大会后曾到中国戏剧家协会和戏剧报社，要求剧协把呼吁书发给全国各剧团，并威胁戏剧报编辑部刊登呼吁书。李畅还利用中央戏剧学院收发制度不严格的缺点，把呼吁书通过了合法的手续发到全国各地。
    李畅、赵森林等还密谋成立“舞台美术设计公司”，把北京各剧团的设计人员都拆散，拉到所谓“设计公司”，企图这样来篡夺舞台美术界的领导权，脱离党的领导。
    在九百多戏剧和美术工作者参加的反右派辩论会上，右派分子李畅、刘世彩已经在铁的事实面前开始低头认罪。右派分子赵森林还企图顽抗，引起到会人们极大的愤慨。这个辩论会还将继续举行。
