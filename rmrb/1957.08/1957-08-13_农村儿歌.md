	Rural Children's Song
	Li Zuohua
	Green wheat fields, blue sky, wildflowers blooming on the green hills. Beneath the hills, a green expanse, wheat waves rolling as far as the eye can see. One glance, half a day's walk, and still walking on the commune's fields.
	Small bellows, small bellows, squeak, squeak, squeak, I help Mom tend the stove. Water in the pot, bubbling up, Mom is busy making dumplings. Twelve o'clock, just struck, serving the dumplings and waiting for Dad.

    农村儿歌
    李作华
    麦海青青山，蓝蓝天，青青山上野花鲜。青山下，绿一片，麦浪滚滚望无边。看一眼，走半天，再走还是社里田。
    小风箱小风箱，呱呱呱，我帮妈妈把锅拉。锅里水，翻了花，妈妈忙把饺子下。十二点，刚打罢，盛好饺子等爸爸。
