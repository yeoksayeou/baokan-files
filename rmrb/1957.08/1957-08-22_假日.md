    An old comrade, over forty years old, led his children, the adult carrying a hoe, the children carrying iron buckets, all setting off! To work in the garden behind the house.
    This was a Sunday in July, the sky was clear and cloudless, the sun was strong. In the garden were two large umbrella-like cherry trees with curved branches, their leaves motionless, and red, juicy cherries hanging heavily; a patch of ground was covered with strawberry plants, locally called "Korean Fruits," their green leaves subtly exuding fragrance; another patch of ground was planted with rows of vegetables: broad beans, squashes, tomatoes, eggplants... vines climbing, green leaves overlapping. The sunlight was like golden powder sprinkled on everything, shimmering and dazzling.
    The children were picking cherries, the older ones circling the trees, the younger ones crawling under the tree canopies, picking and eating, throwing handfuls into the buckets. The adult was raking weeds, skillfully tending to the vegetable plants, removing useless offshoots, so that the branches could be more refined, and more fully receive the caress of the sun and the nourishment of water, grow taller, and bear more plump and full fruit.
    The old comrade had a child-like face: a black, chubby face, a short nose, thick lips. Only the few strands of white hair at his temples and the wrinkles appearing at the corners of his eyes revealed his age. His steps were steady, his actions natural, no one would believe that his two eyes were in a semi-blind state, having been wounded by a gunshot. Back then, a bullet from a landlord's armed force pierced his temple, damaging the optic nerve. He had worked for more than ten years in this condition. Now, those two eyes relied on light, shadow, and color to identify direction, and on memory and deduction to familiarize themselves with the environment. His eyes always seemed to be lost in thought.
    The scorching sunlight of July, the mottled green, the blue of the sky, the red of the flowers, the fragrance of the soil and fruit trees, the sounds of children playing… all of this showed peace and happiness. The old comrade, with one leg kneeling on the soil, tended to the vegetable plants, occasionally looking up at the sun, smiling, as if feeling all of this, or as if immersed in memories.
    What was he thinking about? Perhaps in the feeling of peace and happiness, he couldn't help but recall the years of war and hardship. He had farmed the land, worked as a handyman, fought enemies in the forest with knives and guns, and when doing underground work, he pulled rickshaws, carried heavy loads at the docks… These experiences were more intensely imprinted in his mind than the feelings before him. – Or perhaps he wasn't recalling the past, but in this quiet time, he couldn't help but think of the recent days of thrilling new struggles. The new reality was testing him; requiring him to calmly and resolutely meet the battle, as he had done for decades. – Perhaps he wasn't thinking about anything at all at this moment. In the scorching sun, in the joyful labor, he was simply thinking about how to make cherry jam, and how he could eat the fresh and tender beans he had grown himself in the evening.
    The children had picked half an iron bucket of cherries and took them to wash by the tap. Several arms all reached into the iron bucket to stir and mix, making water splash. One of the younger ones secretly pressed a finger on the outlet of the water pipe, and the water shot out suddenly, spraying directly onto the faces and bodies of the older children... immediately a water fight broke out.
    A guest arrived. An uncle in a trench coat, with a tall and sturdy figure, quietly came to the garden. The children all knew that this was their father's most welcomed guest, their father's old comrade-in-arms. The children loved to watch the way these two adults met: greeting each other with: "Hey! Old pal!" "You're here! Old pal!" The two men pulled at each other's arms, almost as if they were about to embrace. The guest immediately took off his coat, picked up a hoe, and effortlessly began to hoe the weeds.
    "Old pal! Today, I'm going to let you taste the flavor of the beans and tomatoes I grew myself, how about that? Not bad results, right?"
    "Results are of course the most important thing!..." the guest said meaningfully. The two men laughed heartily.
    When the old comrade was with his comrade-in-arms, the look on his face seemed even more like a child's. Of course, they had been together almost since they were children. Back when the central Soviet area established the "Labor Children's Corps," they were among the first members of the Northeast "Anti-Japanese Children's Corps." Back then, they weren't picking cherries and having water fights… they were single-mindedly thinking about "making revolution." Wearing ragged clothes, shoes with toes showing, their faces blackened with coal dust, their stomachs empty, but they secretly cut the "Blue Sky with a White Sun" from the flags left behind by the Kuomintang, leaving behind a "red all over the ground," to use as red scarves; they also found a few copper buttons to use as "Lenin badges" to hang on their chests. In a world dominated by Japanese devils and puppet troops, they were constantly envious of and secretly imitated the Children's Corps members in the Central Soviet Area... Speaking of which, this was already more than twenty years ago. Although the old comrade couldn't see his comrade-in-arms, and didn't know what changes had taken place in his appearance over the years, that cheerful and bright personality was exactly the same as when he was a child. As soon as he heard his comrade-in-arms' voice, he was very happy, as if he had returned to more than twenty years ago...
    "Old pal! Do you still remember, that summer, the song we learned together to persuade the puppet soldiers to surrender?" The old comrade smiled as he looked at the sun and sang softly:
    "Dear soldiers of the pro-Japanese army,
    Spring is just around the corner,
    Everyone, perk up your spirits,
    Don't sleep soundly in your dreams,
    Why not revolt and kill the enemy…"
    "Old pal, this is the tune of 'Lament of the Four Seasons,' and these lines are well written! – Your memory is really good. Let's try singing this one again…" The guest stopped hoeing the weeds, looked up and thought for a moment, and then also sang softly:
    "Comrades, fight!
    Move forward!
    Dawn is ahead,
    With our own bayonets and guns,
    Open our own path!
    We must strive for the success of the revolution,
    We must overthrow the ruling class,
    And safeguard the workers, peasants, and soldiers…"
    This was the "Young Pioneers Song" that was popular back then. As they recalled, the two of them sang another "Anti-Japanese Children's Corps Song" together:
    "Are you ready?
    Always ready!
    We are all Anti-Japanese Children's Corps members,
    The future masters,
    Will surely be us!
    Dong dong dong dong, dong dong dong,
    Dong dong dong dong, dong dong dong!"
    The sound of the singing grew louder and louder:
    "…Little brothers,
    Little sisters,
    Let's all join hands,
    The future masters,
    Will surely be us,
    Dong dong dong dong, dong dong dong,
    Dong dong dong dong,…"
    The two men sang, forgetting everything else. Standing beside them were the "little brothers" and "little sisters," listening curiously, some with wide eyes, others with their eyes squinted into slits. Dad and Uncle were always very happy together, but they seemed especially happy today!

　　假日
　　姚锦
    一位四十余岁的老同志，领着他的孩子们，大人拿着锄头，孩子们提了铁桶，一起开步走！到屋后的园子里去劳动。
    这是7月里的一个星期天，碧空无云，阳光强烈。园子里有两棵大伞般的、枝干弯曲的樱桃树，叶子纹丝不动，红喷喷的樱桃累累欲坠；一块地上铺满了草莓、本地称为“高丽果”的绿叶，隐隐地飘逸着香气；另一块地上种着一畦畦的蔬菜：扁豆、倭瓜、西红柿、茄子……枝蔓攀缘、绿叶交叠。阳光有如金色粉末般撒在这一切之上，闪烁耀眼。
    孩子们采摘着樱桃，大的围着树转，小的钻到树伞底下去，一边摘一边吃，一把把往桶子里边扔。大人耧着杂草，熟练地收拾着菜棵，打去无用的分杈，让枝干精练些，更充分地承受阳光的爱抚、水分的滋润，长得更挺拔，结的实更肥硕饱满。
    老同志长着一副孩子般的面孔：黑胖胖的脸，短短的鼻子，厚厚的嘴唇。只是从鬓边的几根白发、眼角隐现的皱纹，才看得出年龄的标志。他的脚步稳健，行动自然，谁也不相信那两只眼是处于半盲状态，受过枪伤的。当年地主武装的一粒子弹射穿了他的太阳穴，毁坏了视神经，在这种情况下工作了十多年，现在那两只眼睛依靠光、影、彩色识别方向，依靠记忆和推断熟悉环境，两眼总像是在凝神思索。
    7月的白灼的光线，斑驳的绿色，天的蓝，花的红，泥土和果木的香气，孩子们的嬉闹之声……这一切显示着和平与幸福。老同志一条腿跪在泥土上，侍弄着菜棵，不时地仰起脸，望着阳光，微笑着，像是在感受着这一切，又像是沉浸在回想之中。
    他在想着什么呢？也许在和平与幸福的感受中，又不禁忆起了战争和艰苦的年月。种过地、当过杂工、在森林里和敌人动过刀枪，做地下工作的时候，拉过洋车，在码头上扛大个儿……这些经历是比眼前的感受更强烈地留在脑子里。——也许不是忆起过去，而是在这安静的时间里，又不由得想到最近几天的惊心动魄的新的斗争。新的现实在考验他；要求他像几十年来做过的那样，沉着、冷静地迎接战斗。——也许他这时什么也没有想，在炙热的阳光下，在愉快的劳动中，他只是想着樱桃酱的制法，以及晚间可以吃到自己手种的鲜嫩的豆角吧。
    孩子采摘下来了半铁桶樱桃，拿到自来水管旁边去洗。几只胳臂一齐伸到铁桶里去拌搅，弄得水星飞溅。小的一个偷偷地把手指按在出水口上，水猛地斜射出来，直喷到大孩子们的脸上、身上，……立刻发生了一场水战。
    客人来了。一个穿着风衣的，身材魁伟的叔叔，悄悄地来到了园子里。孩子们都认识这是爸爸最欢迎的客人，是爸爸的老战友。孩子们很爱看这两个大人见面时的样子：彼此招呼着：“哙！老伙计！”“来啦！老伙计！”两个人互相拉扯着胳臂，几乎像要拥抱起来的神气。客人立即脱去外衣，拿起锄头，不费劲儿地锄起草来。
    “老伙计！今天要让你尝尝我自己种的豆角、西红柿的滋味，怎么样？成绩不坏吧？”
    “成绩当然是主要的！……”客人意味深长地说。两个人哈哈笑起来。
    老同志和战友相处的时候，脸上的神气便显得更像一个孩子。当然，他们几乎是从小就在一起的，还是传来中央苏区建立了“劳动儿童团”的时候，他们是东北“抗日儿童团”的头一批团员。那时候，他们在一起不是摘樱桃，打水仗，……他们一心想“搞革命”。穿着破烂的衣衫，露脚趾的鞋子，煤炭尘土抹黑着脸，饿着肚子，可是，他们悄悄地把国民党留下的旗子上的
  “青天白日”剪下去，剩下一块“满地红”，用做红领巾；又找到几枚铜扣子，用做挂在胸前的“列宁牌”，在日本鬼子和伪军横行的世界里，他们整天羡慕着、偷偷模仿着中央苏区的儿童团员。……说起来，这已经是二十几年前的事情了。老同志虽然不能看见自己的战友，不知道他的样子在这些年有了那些变化；但是，那快活爽朗的性格，和小时候是一模一样的。他一听到战友的声音，就很高兴，就好像又回到了二十多年以前……。
      “老伙计！你还记得吧，那个夏天，咱们一道学会的那只劝伪军投降的歌子？”老同志微笑地望着阳光，轻声唱起来：
    “亲日士兵兄弟们哪，
    眼看立了春哪，
    大家提精神哪，
    别在梦中睡沉沉哪，
    何不反正杀敌人哪……”
      “老伙计，这是‘四季叹’的调子，这几句词儿写得好！——你的记性也真不坏呀。咱们再试试唱这一个吧……”客人停住锄草，抬头想了想，也轻声唱起来：
    “同志们奋斗！
    要上前呀，
    曙光在前，
    用我们自己的刺刀和枪炮，
    开自己的路！
    我们要争取革命成功，
    我们要打倒统治阶级，
    维护工农兵……”
    这是当年流行的“少年先锋队歌”。他们两个人一边回忆，一边又合唱起另一只“抗日儿童团歌”来：
    “准备好了吗？
    时刻准备着！
    我们都是抗日儿童团，
    将来的主人，
    必定是我们！
    咚咚咚咚，咚咚咚，
    咚咚咚咚，咚咚咚！”
    越唱声音越高：
      “……小兄弟们呀，
    小姊妹们呀，
    我们大家手拉住手，
    将来的主人，
    必定是我们，
    咚咚咚咚，咚咚咚，
    咚咚咚咚，……”
    两个人忘怀一切地唱着。在他们旁边站着“小兄弟们”和“小姊妹们”，好奇地听着，有的睁大了眼睛，有的笑得眼睛眯成一道缝。爸爸和叔叔在一起总是很高兴的，可是，他们今天好像特别高兴呀！
