Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 22nd: The Albanian Tirana football team defeated the Shenyang Troops football team in Shenyang this afternoon with a score of 2-1.

　　Today, the Tirana football team adjusted its lineup and replaced several reserve players. At the beginning of the game, the visiting team engaged in a fierce battle with the Shenyang Troops football team, which was strong in physique and fast in speed. In the first half, the visiting team scored two goals. The first goal was scored by right winger Lefik Resnja, a Master of Sports who has participated in 62 international matches, in a melee in front of the opponent's goal. The second goal was a long shot by team captain Bijai Shevdet, a Master of Sports who has participated in 52 international matches, playing as a midfielder.

　　In the second half, the Shenyang Troops football team strengthened its attack, changing from passive to active in the first half, but because of inaccurate passing, they were often intercepted by the visiting team's defenders when they attacked the opponent's goal. Only eight minutes before the end of the game, the home team had the opportunity to score a penalty kick and pull back a goal because the visiting team's defender fouled in the penalty area.

　　The Tirana football team will leave Shenyang for Changchun on the 23rd.

　　地拉那足球队战胜沈阳队
    新华社沈阳22日电　阿尔巴尼亚地拉那足球队今天下午在沈阳以二比一战胜沈阳部队足球队。
    今天，地拉那足球队调整了阵营，换上了几名后备力量。球赛一开始，客队就和体力强、速度快的沈阳部队足球队展开了激烈的争夺战，上半时客队先后射进两球。第一个球是右边锋、曾参加过六十二次国际比赛的运动健将列非克·列斯尼亚在对方门前混战中射进的。第二个球是担任前卫的球队队长、曾参加过五十二次国际比赛的运动健将比雅依·谢夫杰特远射进的。
    下半时，沈阳部队足球队加强了进攻，由上半时的被动转为主动，但因传球不准，往往攻到对方门前，就被客队后卫截去，当终场前八分钟时，客队后卫在禁区犯规，主队才获得发点球的机会扳回一球。
    地拉那足球队将在23日离开沈阳去长春。
