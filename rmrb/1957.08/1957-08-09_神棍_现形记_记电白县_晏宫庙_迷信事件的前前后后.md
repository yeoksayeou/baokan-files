The Unmasking of a "Sorcerer"
    —A Record of the "Yan Palace Temple" Superstition Incident in Dianbai County
    Cui Wenming, Chen Shusheng
    From May to July, a large-scale "Yan Palace Temple" superstition incident occurred in Dianbai County, Guangdong. Altogether, more than 80,000 people from seven nearby counties rushed to worship the gods, obtain "divine medicine," and carry "divine amulets" after hearing the news. The matter grew day by day, eventually developing to the point where sorcerers incited the masses to beat cadres, surround the township government, and openly clamor for the "elimination of the Communist Party" and the "dissolution of cooperatives," exposing the conspiracy of a small group of counter-revolutionaries and landlords to instigate and sabotage. After the local leadership took effective measures to expose the true faces of the class enemies, the masses angrily demolished the "Yan Palace Temple" shrine, and the incident subsided.

    The Masses Deceived, Significant Losses
    "Yan Palace Temple" is located in Xiadong Township, Dianbai County. The god in the temple is called "Madam Xian." Before liberation, every year on the 17th day of the first lunar month, the masses gathered in front of the temple to "parade the gods" and perform operas, called "doing the annual event." On the first and fifteenth of each month, the masses also flocked to burn incense and seek divination. After liberation, the "Yan Palace Temple" became deserted, the temple buildings dilapidated, and some farmers simply demolished the temple and planted fruit trees and crops on the temple grounds.

    In April and May of this year, influenza was prevalent in many villages in Dianbai County, and rumors abounded. Sorcerers and witches took advantage of this opportunity to become active. On May 17, a witch from Xialing Township returned from worshiping at "Fushan Temple" and claimed that "Madam Xian has returned to save the people." The next day, she and another witch named Tiger Milk rushed to the old site of "Yan Palace Temple" to burn incense, and acted like they were possessed, shouting and jumping, saying: "The plague god is descending, half the people will die. To avoid disaster, quickly worship the gods." She also threatened the masses, saying: "If you don't believe in Madam Xian, your bones and flesh will rot and die." Thus, one told ten, and ten told a hundred, and the masses slaughtered chickens and pigs to worship the gods, and the incense at "Yan Palace Temple" burned day and night.

    From the end of May to the beginning of June, even more people came to "Yan Palace Temple" to worship the gods. The fifteen villages next to the temple were filled with guests who came from afar to burn incense. Those who had no place to stay camped out on the five hills behind the temple. At this time, sorcerers and witches from various places also gathered here in large numbers. They colluded with each other to swindle the masses, spreading rumors that "Madam Xian wants good people to eat 'human heart potatoes' and 'three-legged tigers' (wild plants, which can cause numbness if eaten in large quantities) to ward off disaster." They also said: "Women who carry divine amulets can get rid of all diseases, and patients who drink 'magic water' (sewage from ponds mixed with red dye) can ensure peace." In addition, they distributed superstitious leaflets, asking everyone to copy them. According to statistics, they defrauded the masses of more than 3,860 yuan through inscription fees, medicine sales, and other methods. Over the course of two months, the sorcerers and witches not only swindled money, but also caused sixteen farmers to die from poisoning due to selling so-called "divine medicine" and "magic water." According to relevant statistics, the masses wasted more than 120,000 yuan due to participating in superstitious activities. More than 100 acres of crops around the temple site were trampled flat, and scattered with white rice for the "divine soldiers" and "divine horses" to eat. Thirteen women were raped by hooligans, sorcerers, and others.

    They are Counter-Revolutionaries, Not "Gods"!
    After the "Yan Palace Temple" superstitious activities started, reactionary landlords and lawless elements from various places became active. Once, during a sacrifice, a sorcerer maliciously spread rumors to the masses, announcing: "The County Party Secretary has approved everyone to worship the gods, don't you believe it?" Then he read out a sacrificial text, falsely adding a large number of cadres' names, saying: "Look, the cooperative director and Communist Party members are taking the lead in worshiping the gods." At this time, Li Wenquan, a landlord from Lintou Township, wearing a shirt and suit pants, pretended to be a cadre from Lintou Township to preside over the sacrifice, defrauding people of pork and money.

    When the sorcerer "descended," his tone gradually changed. At first, he talked about gods and monsters, but later he discussed "national affairs." Once, the sorcerer said: "Madam Xian descended and said that the Kuomintang will return in August, and the cooperative directors and production team leaders will be the first to be beheaded." When some cadres' family members in nearby villages heard this, they became afraid and wanted the cadres to go home and stop working. When the masses went to the temple to worship the gods, the sorcerer pretended to "care about the lives of the masses," spreading rumors that this year the cooperative would only distribute 25 kilograms of grain per person per month, and the members would have to work without food. He also slandered the state monopoly of purchase and marketing policy, calling on everyone to oppose the Communist Party. Under the instigation and incitement of the sorcerer, incidents of surrounding the township government and beating cadres occurred in Matatou Township, Wenfeng Township, Rongxia Township, and others.

    By the end of June, the reactionary activities of the "Yan Palace Temple" sorcerer became even more blatant. When "descending" at night, he shouted slogans such as "To have food and clothing, we must eliminate the Communist Party," "To get ahead, we must dissolve the cooperatives," and "Land must be returned to the landlords," and forced the worshiping masses to shout along, saying: "Not shouting slogans means you are not sincere." At this time, the sorcerer was preparing to rebuild the "Yan Palace Temple" on a large scale, and released the information: "Hong Kong is sending money to support us in building the temple, and everyone must fight the Communist Party to the end."

    The honest farmers who went there to worship the gods felt disgusted by the sorcerer's provocative lies. Everyone discussed: "Worshiping the gods is worshiping the gods! Why oppose the Communist Party?" "Why does Madam Xian speak for the Kuomintang and the landlords, and not for us?" As things became clearer, the masses realized they had been deceived, and everyone angrily said: "They are counter-revolutionaries, not gods!" One night, when the sorcerer forced the masses to shout reactionary slogans, the masses firmly opposed it, and even rebuked the sorcerer on the spot, saying: "We have never had such a good government. If you want to overthrow it, we will ask the government to punish you!" After a meeting, the farmers of Dacun Village in Xiadong Township submitted a request to the government to investigate the "Yan Palace Temple" incident.

    The Truth Comes Out, the Chief Culprit Arrested
    Based on the masses' reports and after detailed investigation, in mid-July, the Dianbai County public security department cracked the "Yan Palace Temple" reactionary group, and legally arrested seven people, including Wang Hengmao, Wang Ruiying, Wang Youen, and Cui Quanyi, who were the open and hidden reactionary leaders.

    It turned out that this group was entirely composed of counter-revolutionary elements colluding with sorcerers and hooligans. They had organized and planned to collude with nearby unlawful landlords and rich peasants, using the masses' superstition to carry out sabotage activities. Among them, there was a "Premier," an "Assistant," a "Finance," and an "Accountant," and they often held secret meetings to plan activities. They often cleverly hid themselves, while letting ordinary sorcerers and witches speak out, thus deceiving many people. For example, Wang Hengmao, the assistant of this group, was actually the main leader, and everything was planned and advised by him, but he was only dug out at the end. It has now been verified that Wang Hengmao has always been a counter-revolutionary element in history. Before liberation, he was a secret agent of the puppet joint defense team. In 1947, he infiltrated the revolutionary ranks as a mole. Because he informed the Kuomintang, five revolutionary comrades were arrested, two of whom were killed. After liberation, he continued to engage in counter-revolutionary activities, not only selling opium and forging RMB, but also participating in bandit organizations, robbing Feng Changjie's family in Xialing Township and killing Feng Changjie. He was arrested by the government in 1951 and released home in 1955, but he continued to commit wrongdoing and engage in smuggling and tax evasion. When the "Yan Palace Temple" superstitious activities started this time, he immediately convened four secret meetings at home to arrange for this reactionary group to stir up the masses' dissatisfaction with the Party and the government and create chaos. Under the planning and arrangement of this group, sorcerers, hooligans, and reactionary landlords went out to collude, thus expanding the superstitious incident.

    After the "Yan Palace Temple" scam was completely exposed, the farmers of Dianbai County aroused a wave of unparalleled anger. Cadres and the masses said: The remaining class enemies have not given up, and we must not be careless and let them stir up trouble. On July 11, more than 400 people rushed to "Yan Palace Temple," demolished the shrine, and burned the idols. The next day, more than a thousand farmers from the three townships of Xiadong, Xialing, and Rongxia held a meeting, and farmers who had been poisoned by superstition took to the stage to accuse the crimes of this reactionary group, demanding that the government punish them according to law.

    “神棍”现形记
    ——记电白县“晏宫庙”迷信事件的前前后后
    崔文明　陈树生
    5月至7月间，广东电白县发生了一桩大规模的“晏宫庙”迷信事件。前后共有附近七个县的八万多人，闻风赶去拜神、取“神药”、带“神符”。事情一天天扩大，最后竟然发展到神棍煽动群众打干部、包围乡政府，公开叫嚣要“消灭共产党”、“解散合作社”的地步，暴露了一小撮反革命分子和地主分子从中进行挑拨、破坏的阴谋。经过当地领导采取有效措施，揭破阶级敌人的真面目，群众愤怒地拆毁“晏宫庙”的神棚，事件便平息了下来。
    群众受骗　损失重大
    “晏宫庙”在电白县的下垌乡。庙内的神称为“冼太夫人”。解放前，每逢正月17日，群众便集聚在庙前“游神”、演戏，称为“做年例”。每逢初一、十五，群众也纷纷前往烧香、求签。解放后，“晏宫庙”香火冷落了，庙屋破烂了，有些农民便索性把庙拆掉，把庙地种上果树和农作物。
    今年4、5月间，电白县不少乡村发生流行性感冒，谣言纷纷。神棍、巫婆便乘这个机会活动起来。5月17日，下岭乡巫婆到“浮山庙”拜神回来，就声称“冼太夫人回来了，要救万民”。第二天她便和另一个名叫老虎奶的巫婆赶到“晏宫庙”旧址烧香，并装神装鬼，大叫大跳起来，说道：“瘟神下降，人死一半，要免灾难，快来拜神。”又恐吓群众说：“不信冼太夫人，就会烂骨烂肉而死。”于是，一传十，十传百，群众便纷纷劏鸡杀猪来拜神，“晏宫庙”的香火日夜不熄。
    5月底至6月初，到“晏宫庙”拜神的人更多了。庙旁的十五个村子都住满了远道来烧香的客人，没有地方住的，便露宿在庙后的五个山头。这时，各地神棍、巫婆也大量集中在这里，他们串同一气向群众诈取财物，造谣说：“冼太夫人叫良民吃‘人心薯’、‘三脚虎’（野生植物，多吃会麻醉），可解灾消难。”又说：“妇女带神符可除百病，病人吃‘法水’（塘中污水加红色染料）可保平安。”此外，又散发迷信传单，叫大家传抄。据统计：他们用题款、卖药等方法，一共骗取了群众三千八百六十多元。两个多月来，神棍、巫婆不仅骗取财物，而且由于贩卖所谓“神药”、“法水”，已使十六个农民中毒致死。另据有关方面统计：群众由于参加迷信活动，浪费钱财达十二万元以上。庙址周围一百多亩农作物给践踏得如同平地，而且还到处撒满供“神兵”、“神马”吃的白米。有十三个妇女被流氓、神棍等强奸了。
    是反革命，不是“神”！
    “晏宫庙”迷信活动闹开后，各地的反动地主、不法分子便活跃了起来，有一次祭神的时候，神棍便向群众恶意地造谣宣布：“县委书记批准大家拜神了，大家还不相信吗？”跟着又宣读祭文，后面捏造了一大批干部的名字，说：“你们看，社主任、共产党员都带头拜神了。”就在这时候，林头乡的地主李文泉，穿了衬衫、西装裤，冒充林头乡的干部前来主持祭神，骗取猪肉和钱。
    神棍“降神”的时候，口气也逐渐改变了，初时还说神说怪，后来便谈论“国家大事”。有一次，神棍说：“冼太夫人下降说，国民党8月回来，社主任和生产队长要先被杀头。”附近一些乡村的干部家属听到这样说，便害怕起来，要干部回家不干工作。当群众到庙拜神的时候，神棍又装着“关心群众生活”的样子，造谣说今年合作社每人每月将只能分二十五斤谷，社员有得做无得食。又向群众毁谤统购统销政策，叫大家反对共产党。在神棍的挑拨和煽动下，马踏乡、文峰乡、荣夏乡等就出现了包围乡政府、殴打干部的事件。
    6月底，“晏宫庙”神棍的反动活动更加露骨了。夜里“降神”的时候，大喊“要有吃有穿就要消灭共产党”、“要出头就要解散合作社”、“土地要退回给地主”等口号，并且强迫拜神的群众跟着喊，说：“不叫口号就是无诚心。”这时，神棍已筹备大兴土木重建“晏宫庙”，并放出空气：“香港方面就汇钱支援我们建庙，大家要和共产党斗到底。”
    到那里拜神的正直的农民，对神棍的挑拨谰言，初时感到恶心，大家都议论说：“拜神就拜神嘛！为什么要反对共产党呢？”“冼太夫人为什么替国民党和地主说话，不替我们说话呢？”事情越来越清楚，群众知道受骗了，大家愤怒地说：“他们是反革命，不是神！”有一天晚上，神棍迫群众叫反动口号，群众坚决反对，而且当场斥责神棍说：“我们从来没有过这样好的政府，你们要推翻它，我们就要政府惩办你！”下垌乡大村的农民开会后，纷纷向政府提出追查“晏宫庙”事件的要求。
    真相大白　首犯就捕
    根据群众的检举和经过详细的侦察，7月中旬，电白县公安部门破获了“晏宫庙”的反动集团，并依法逮捕了公开和隐蔽的反动头子王恒茂、王瑞英、王友恩、崔全宜等七人。
    原来这个集团全是由反革命分子串同神棍、流氓组成的。他们有组织有计划地串通附近的不法地主、富农，利用群众迷信来进行破坏活动。他们中间有“总理”、有“助理”，也有“财务”和“会计”，并且经常秘密开会，布置活动。他们常常自己巧妙地隐蔽起来，而由一般的神棍、巫婆出头说话，因而迷惑了不少群众。例如这个集团的助理王恒茂，实际上是主要头子，一切都由他策划、献计，可是他却是在最后才被挖出来。现在已经查明，王恒茂历史上一贯就是反革命分子，解放前曾当伪联防队的密探，1947年他钻进革命队伍做坐探，由于他向国民党告密，有五个革命同志被捕，其中有两个被杀害。解放后，他继续进行反革命勾当，不仅贩卖鸦片，伪造人民币，而且参加土匪组织，抢劫下岭乡冯昌杰家，打死了冯昌杰。1951年他被政府逮捕，1955年释放回家，可是回家后仍一向为非作歹，走私漏税。这次“晏宫庙”搞起了迷信活动，他立刻在家中召开四次秘密会议，布置这个反动集团煽起群众对党和政府的不满，制造混乱。在这个集团的策划和布置下，神棍、流氓、反动地主便四出串连活动，因而把迷信事件扩大了起来。
    当“晏宫庙”的骗局被彻底拆穿后，电白农民激起无比愤怒的浪潮。干部和群众都说：残余的阶级敌人还未死心，切不能麻痹大意让他们兴风作浪。7月11日四百多人冲到“晏宫庙”，把神棚拆掉，把神像烧毁。第二天，下垌、下岭、荣夏三个乡千多农民又举行集会，受到迷信毒害的农民纷纷上台控诉这个反动集团的罪恶，要求政府依法惩办。（原载8月3日南方日报，本报略有删节）
