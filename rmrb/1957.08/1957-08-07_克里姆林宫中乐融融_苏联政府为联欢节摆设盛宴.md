The Kremlin is filled with joy
The Soviet Government Hosts a Grand Banquet for the Youth Festival

Moscow Dispatch from our Newspaper, August 6th: On the evening of August 5th, the Soviet government held a grand reception in the gardens of the Kremlin for the Youth Festival. Approximately four thousand people attended the reception, including representatives from various countries participating in the festival, ambassadors from many countries to the Soviet Union, representatives of the working people of Moscow, and representatives from all walks of life.

Soviet party and government leaders Bulganin, Khrushchev, Mikoyan, Zhukov, and others attended the reception.

As dusk fell on August 5th, and the five large red stars above the Kremlin shone their first rays, tens of thousands of colored electric lights illuminated the garden, transforming it into a magical world. The delicious food and wine and the wonderful performances at the banquet did not capture the attention of the young people from various countries. They all wanted to find a gap to squeeze to the front of the banquet tables to catch a glimpse of the Soviet leaders. The wide aisle between the six rows of long tables was so crowded that hundreds of white, black, and yellow hands were raised from time to time to repeatedly cheer and salute the Soviet leaders. Black youth in particular, occupied three strongholds to the left, right, and center of the tables, repeatedly shouting: "Peace! Friendship!" "Salute to the Soviet Government!"

Furtseva left the presidium table and strolled over to the table of the Chinese delegation, shaking hands with the actresses Du Jinfang, Hong Xiannv, and Fang Chushan, who were standing in the front row. Fang Chushan quickly untied the flowered headscarf she was wearing and gave it to Furtseva to wear. She said, "Keep it as a souvenir! It's a gift from a Chinese girl." Furtseva looked at the headscarf and spread her hands, saying, "Thank you, girl, but unfortunately, I didn't bring a gift to give you. Well then, sign your name and leave your address so we can communicate later."

At half-past ten, Hu Yaobang, the head of the Chinese delegation, and other young Chinese representatives left the banquet table and walked outside. As they reached the tree-lined path, a large man suddenly emerged from the woods, embraced Hu Yaobang, and lifted him into the air, spinning him around three and a half times, amidst a burst of applause. After being put down, Hu Yaobang looked at the big man and recognized an old acquaintance: the secretary of the Party committee of Moscow's Proletarian District. Hu Yaobang had no way to lift this big man up and spin him around a few times, so he held his hand and walked around in circles for five minutes. At this moment, a female general emerged from the woods, grabbed Hu Yaobang's hands, and said, "Why don't you come and visit our district? We have large factories, a glorious revolutionary tradition, and even more beautiful girls." The secretary of the Proletarian District Party Committee immediately came forward to argue that the Chinese Youth Delegation should visit their district. Thus, a debate began. They argued over the advantages of their respective districts, wanting the Chinese guests to visit. Finally, the debaters and the guests reached an agreement: all twenty-five districts of Moscow were good, so the young Chinese representatives must visit them all. The enthusiastic hostess turned out to be Shakalova, the secretary of the Kirov District Party Committee of Moscow.

After the reception, fireworks were set off, and a dance was held on the garden paths decorated in the style of Russian fairy tales. A scene from the Kremlin night banquet. TASS facsimile photo (Xinhua News Agency dispatch)

    克里姆林宫中乐融融
    苏联政府为联欢节摆设盛宴
    本报莫斯科6日电　8月5日晚，苏联政府在克里姆林宫的花园里为联欢节举行了盛大的招待会。出席招待会的有参加联欢节的各国代表团代表、许多国家驻苏使节、莫斯科劳动人民以及社会各界代表约四千人。
    苏联党和政府的领导人布尔加宁、赫鲁晓夫、米高扬、朱可夫等出席了招待会。
    8月5日夜幕徐落，当克里姆林宫上空五个大红星闪出第一道光芒时，宫里花园绿荫中万盏彩色电灯已放射光明，把整个花园照耀得像神仙世界。宴会上的美酒佳肴和精采表演都没有吸引住各国青年们，他们都想找一个空隙，挤到宴会的桌子前头，多看两眼苏联领导人员们。前面的六排长桌中间宽阔的甬道，一直挤得水泄不通，几百双白色、黑色、黄色的手不时举起来向苏联的领导人员一次又一次欢呼致敬，特别是黑人青年们，他们占领了左右和中间桌前的三个据点，此起彼落地轮流高呼：“和平！友谊！”“向苏联政府致敬！”
    福尔采娃离开了主席团的桌子，信步走到中国代表团的青年的席上来，向站在前排的女演员杜近芳、红线女、方初善握手问好。方初善连忙解下了自己围着的花头巾给福尔采娃围上。她说：“留作纪念吧！中国姑娘送的。”福尔采娃看了看花头巾，两手摊开说：“谢谢你，姑娘，可惜我没有随身带来送给你的礼物，那末，签个名留个地址吧，以后通信好啦。”
    十点半钟，中国代表团团长胡耀邦和其他中国青年代表们离开了酒桌向外边走，当走到林荫路的时候，忽然从树林中出来一名大汉，双手抱住胡耀邦，把他举在空中转了三个半圆圈，四周掌声一片。胡耀邦被放下来以后看看那位大汉，原来是老相识，他是莫斯科无产阶级区的党委书记。胡耀邦没有办法把这位大汉也抱起转几个圈，只好握着他的手绕着圈子走了五分钟。这时树林中又出来一位女将，她双手拉着胡耀邦说：“为什么你们不到我们区里来作客呢？我们区里也有大工厂，也有光荣的革命传统，而且有更多的美丽姑娘。”无产阶级区党委书记马上出来辩论说，中国青年代表团应当到他们那里去作客。于是一场论战展开了。他们互相争道自己区的优点，想要中国客人们去访问。最后，辩论者和客人一致达成协议：莫斯科二十五个区，区区都好，因此，中国青年代表们一定都要去作客。那位热情的女主人原来就是莫斯科基洛夫区党委书记沙可洛娃。
    会后还放了焰火，在按俄罗斯童话装饰起来的花园通道上举行了舞会。克里姆林宫夜宴的一个场面　塔斯社传真照片（新华社发）
