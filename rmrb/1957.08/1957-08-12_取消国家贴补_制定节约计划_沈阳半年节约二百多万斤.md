Cancel State Subsidies
    Formulate Conservation Plans
    Shenyang Saves Over Two Million Jin in Half a Year

    (Our newspaper's dispatch) Many collective mess halls and residents in Shenyang have reviewed their past grain consumption, voluntarily canceled state-subsidized grain, and formulated plans for saving grain, turning over their monthly surplus grain to the state. According to statistics for the first half of this year, the total amount of grain and grain coupons returned by various units and residents in the city has reached 2,565,887 jin. In order to avoid wasting even a single grain, all grain supply stations in the city have launched a surplus and deficiency adjustment program. Salespersons frequently take time to visit residents to inquire about their grain consumption and promote grain conservation, and they have also established a "Grain Conservation Honor Roll" to commend patriotic actions of residents who save grain.

    取消国家贴补
    制定节约计划
    沈阳半年节约二百多万斤
    本报讯　沈阳市有很多集体伙食单位和居民检查了过去的用粮情况，主动取消了国家补贴的粮食，制定了节约用粮计划，把每月的余粮缴给国家。据今年上半年统计，全市各单位和居民缴回的粮食和粮票已达二百五十六万五千八百八十七斤。为了做到不浪费一粒粮食，全市各粮食供应站开展了余缺调剂工作，营业员们经常抽时间到居民中访问用粮情况，宣传节约粮食，并且建立“节约粮食光荣榜”，表扬居民中节约粮食的爱国行动。
