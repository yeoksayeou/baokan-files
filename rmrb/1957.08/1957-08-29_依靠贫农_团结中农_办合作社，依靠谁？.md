　　Rely on the Poor Peasants, Unite the Middle Peasants
　　Run Cooperatives—Who to Rely On?
　　Wei Jingzai, Secretary of the樟溪乡 Party Committee, Rao Ping County, Guangdong Province

　　A Gust of Evil Wind Causes Chaos
　　Recently, when the cadres of the Longguang Cooperative discussed how to carry out summer planting and strive for a bumper late harvest, they felt a headache and found it difficult to lead because the cooperative had recently seen a rise in evil tendencies. Everyone competed to do the rice harvesting work, which had higher labor remuneration; but when it came to doing dry land work, many people pretended to be sick, and the attendance rate was less than 60%. Before the grain was sold, at least twenty people squeezed into the accounting room every noon, clamoring for money. 社员 Zhang Zhengde, when told by others that the cooperative had no money to pay out at the moment, said, "Whether there is money or not doesn't matter much, it's good to scold a few times to let off steam." Some people who couldn't get money even revealed threatening tones. 社员 owed the state loans of more than 1,300 yuan. After urging them for several nights, only some people were willing to repay more than 100 yuan. There was also a tendency among社员 not to have cadres lead production, and they gave cold shoulders to cadres who inspected the production situation. 社主任, accountants, and other cadres, seeing these situations, felt depressed and said they wanted to resign.
　　Why did these problems arise? Was it because production was not doing well and 社员 could not live a life? It was not. The income of this cooperative increased this year. Through the summer pre-distribution, the problem of 32 households overspending and owing 382 yuan has been solved. 社员’s monthly ration averaged 43 jin, which, although less than last year's 48 jin, also exceeded the cooperative's historical average level. 社干 Zhang Junqiang said, "Before liberation, although the 社员 of Longguang Cooperative had a lot of land, when they harvested grain for themselves, it was only enough for two months of rations. By August, September, and December, 30% of the village (that is, the entire current cooperative) would buy rice in paper tubes (because they could only buy a small amount of rice at a time). Now, averaging 43 jin of grain is really amazing. After cooperation, life has greatly improved. Half of the cloth coupons issued in 1953 were used, and all the cloth coupons in 1956 were bought, and it was still not enough."
　　So where did the evil winds come from? Generally speaking, there are three reasons: First, the cadres' understanding of correctly handling contradictions among the people was not comprehensive. They believed that since it was a matter of contradictions among the people, they did not need to pay much attention to it. They turned a blind eye to some unreasonable abuses of cadres, abuses of the People's Government and the Communist Party, and fallacies that undermined cooperation, and dared not refute them, allowing them to drift along. Some cadres even showed wavering about cooperation. Second, the spontaneous tendencies of individual wealthy middle-peasant 社员 were serious, and their living requirements were too high. Third, the class boundaries in the countryside were blurred, the boundaries between the enemy and ourselves were not clear, and enemies and bad elements took the opportunity to act. For example, wealthy household Zhang Paoyou said to the masses that the unified purchase and sale of grain was "still for others to eat even if you work to death," the labor competition in the cooperative was "making dogs bite each other," and patriotic buying of public bonds was "the government is bad, always wanting to take the money of the peasants." Impure element Zhang Liangcai publicly scolded the Communist Party and the People's Government as "may you have the plague" when he went to the cooperative to collect rations this time; counter-revolutionary family member Shen Chunke killed more than 30 fish by bathing in the cooperative's pond. In addition, some people spread reactionary rumors. These destructive words and deeds were not criticized.

　　Organize the Class Ranks of Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants
　　Based on the above situation, the Party branch and the cooperative committee believed that it was necessary to mobilize poor and lower-middle peasants, form class ranks, and fight against anti-socialist phenomena. Only by打击打 these evil winds,打击打 the enemy's clamor, can the masses be mobilized to carry out production work. Therefore, a meeting of poor and lower-middle peasants was immediately convened to carry out socialist education in order to obtain a reliable basis for carrying out the work.
　　This meeting of poor and lower-middle peasants mainly used class education by means of recalling, comparing, calculating detailed accounts, and using the benefits personally experienced by poor and lower-middle peasants to raise their awareness. In addition to affirming the role played by poor and lower-middle peasants in previous movements, the meeting focused on enlightening and guiding everyone to conduct "four comparisons and one investigation." The first comparison was between the national ruin and poverty during the Kuomintang period before liberation and today's great development of socialist construction, explaining that the new society is thousands of times better than the old society; the second comparison was political emancipation, explaining that today the Communist Party leads poor and lower-middle peasants to be masters of their own affairs; the third comparison was production, explaining that production has been better year by year since liberation, especially after cooperation, and income has increased; the fourth comparison was life, explaining that life is now much better than in the past, and grain rations are more than in the past. The "one investigation" was to investigate the obstacles to developing production and consolidating the cooperative, focusing on pointing out the serious phenomenon of undermining the cooperative within the cooperative. It also found out many facts about the hostile elements among landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionary family members who undermined cooperation, and the wealthy peasants who clamored to dissolve the cooperative; it also found out that some landlords now wanted to raise their heads, and that some peasants had unstable stances and lost their vigilance. These facts sounded an alarm for the peasants present. Poor peasant Liang Jin said, "It's good to have this meeting, a little later, the landlords will come to demand back the fields and houses." Through this education, everyone also realized that poor and lower-middle peasants should unite closely, continue to maintain a strong class ranks, listen to the Communist Party, and resolutely launch a struggle against those evil winds that undermine production and cooperation. The cooperative cadres also examined the fact that in the past, they had not implemented the Party's class line of relying on poor and lower-middle peasants and uniting middle peasants to run the cooperative well, and they had the idea of retreating and slackening. In the future, they must rely on poor and lower-middle peasants. Immediately, the targets for reasoning and criticism were identified, and specific reasoning and criticism issues were studied. The peasants present were in high spirits.

　　Carry Out Reasoning and Criticism of Reactionary Words and Deeds
　　After the meeting, a meeting of cooperative members was convened to implement the spirit of the meeting of poor and lower-middle peasants, to re-educate the masses, expand the class ranks, and immediately conduct face-to-face reasoning and criticism of impure element Zhang Liangcai and wealthy household Zhang Paoyou, who had serious anti-socialist words and deeds, at the meeting. Almost 100% of the masses attended this meeting. As a result, the line between right and wrong was clarified, the masses who attended were educated, and these spreaders of fallacies bowed their heads and admitted their mistakes in front of the masses.

　　Righteousness Rises, A New Look
　　After打击打 evil spirits, Longguang Cooperative promptly convened a meeting of cadres and a meeting of poor and lower-middle peasants to summarize the work and further consolidate and expand the class ranks. Due to this series of work, a new look appeared in the cooperative, which is prominently reflected in the following aspects: First, the enthusiasm for production has increased, and the attendance rate has increased from 60% to more than 95%. Second, the number of people who withdraw money from the cooperative has decreased from more than 20 people per day to five or six people. Those who cannot withdraw money for a while can also understand the cooperative's difficulties and do not quarrel, and the relationship between cadres and the masses has also become closer. Third, cooperative members actively repaid bank loans, and 699 yuan of loans were repaid in one night. Fourth, cadres are full of energy and confident. The cooperative director, accountant, cashier, and others who had publicly offered to resign said they would resolutely continue to do so.
　　Although the socialist education work carried out by Longguang Cooperative to its members is still in its initial stage, it has achieved many results, which shows that to do a good job in rural work and run cooperatives well, it is necessary to resolutely rely on poor and lower-middle peasants and adhere to the Party's class line in the countryside.

　　依靠贫农　团结中农
　　办合作社，依靠谁？
    广东省饶平县樟溪乡党委书记　魏景再
      一股歪风引起混乱
    近来龙光社干部谈到如何开展夏种生产，力争晚造大丰收的时候就感到头痛，觉得社里最近一个时期邪气上升，难以领导。对劳动报酬较高的割稻工作，大伙便争着做；一转到做旱园工作，不少人便假装有病，出勤率不到60％。谷子还没有卖出，每天中午便至少有二十人挤到会计房中嚷着要支钱。社员张正得，人家告诉他社里眼下无钱可支，他说：“有钱无钱问题不大，去骂几句出出气也好。”有的人支不到钱，竟然露出威胁口气。社员欠国家贷款一千三百多元，催了几夜，只有一些人愿意归还一百多元。在社员中还出现不要干部领导生产的偏向，对那些检查生产情况的干部冷言冷语。社主任、会计等干部看见这些情况，心中苦闷，说要辞职。
    为什么产生这些问题呢？是不是生产搞不好，社员过不了生活呢？不是的。这个社今年收入有增加，通过夏季预分，三十二户超支户欠款三百八十二元的问题都已解决。社员每月口粮平均四十三斤，虽然比去年四十八斤少一些，但也超过该社历史上的平均水平，社干张俊强说：“解放前龙光社的社员土地虽多，但割起谷来算自己的却不足两个月口粮。到8、9月和12月，全村（即现在全社）有30％的人家便用纸筒买米（因每次只能买很少的米）。现在平均吃四十三斤粮食，真是了不起。合作化后，生活大大改善了，1953年发的布票只用去一半，1956年布票全部买完还嫌少。”
    那么歪风邪气从何而来呢？总的说来有三方面的原因：第一，干部对正确处理人民内部矛盾理解不全面，认为既然是人民内部矛盾问题，便不用怎样去注意它，对于一些无理谩骂干部，谩骂人民政府和共产党以及破坏合作化等谬论熟视无睹，不敢驳斥，放任自流。有的干部甚至对合作化表示动摇。第二，个别富裕中农社员自发倾向严重，生活要求过高。第三，农村阶级界限模糊，敌我界限划不清，敌人和坏分子乘机活动。如富裕户张跑有向群众说粮食统购统销是“做到死还是给别人吃”，社里的劳动竞赛是“使狗相咬”，爱国买公债是“政府坏，老是想拿农民的钱”。不纯分子张良才这次到社领口粮，公开骂共产党和人民政府“可以发瘟了”；反革命家属沈春科到社的池塘洗澡，搞死三十多条鱼。此外还有人散放反动谣言。这些破坏性的言行，都没有受到批判。
  组织贫苦农民的阶级队伍
    根据以上情况，党支部和社委会认为必须发动贫苦农民，组成阶级队伍，与反社会主义现象作斗争。只有打击这些歪风邪气，打击敌人叫嚣，才能把群众发动起来，开展生产工作。于是立即召开贫农、下中农会议，进行社会主义教育，以便取得进行工作的依靠。
    这次贫农和下中农会议，主要是通过回忆、对比、算细账，拿贫苦农民切身体会到的好处进行阶级教育，提高他们的觉悟。会议上除了肯定贫农和下中农在历次运动中所起的作用外，着重启发引导大家进行“四比一查”。一比解放前国民党时期的国破民穷与今天的社会主义建设的大发展，说明新社会比旧社会好千万倍；二比政治翻身，说明今天共产党领导贫农和下中农当家作主；三比生产，说明解放后、特别是合作化后生产一年比一年好，收入增加；四比生活，说明现在生活比过去大大改善，口粮比过去多了。一查是查发展生产巩固社的障碍，着重指出社内破坏合作社的严重现象。通过四比一查，使贫苦农民认识到几年来农民在政治上，生产生活上都比过去好得多，认识到如果粮食不统购统销对农民是不利的。同时查出了许多地主富农、反革命家属中的敌对分子破坏合作化，和富裕农民叫嚣想搞散社的事实；还查出一些地主现在想抬头，以及一些农民立场不稳，失去警惕性等现象。这些事实，给到会农民敲起了一次警钟。贫农两进说：“好得有开这个会，慢一些，地主要来讨回田地房屋了。”通过这次教育，还使大家认识到贫农和下中农应该紧紧团结，继续保持坚强的阶级队伍，听共产党的话，对那些破坏生产破坏合作化的歪风邪气坚决展开斗争。社干部在会上也检查了过去对依靠贫农和下中农，团结中农来办好社的党的阶级路线贯彻执行得不够好，并且有退坡松劲思想，今后，一定要依靠贫农和下中农。随即确定了进行说理批判的对象，具体研究说理批判问题，到会农民情绪高涨。
  对反动言行进行说理批判
    会后召开了社员大会，贯彻贫农和下中农会议精神，向群众进行再教育，扩大阶级队伍，并即在会上向不纯分子张良才、有严重的反社会主义言行的富裕户张跑有面对面进行说理批判。这次会议参加的群众几乎达到百分之百。这一来，划清了是非界线，教育了到会群众，使这些散布谬论分子在群众面前低头认错。
    正气上升，面貌一新
    龙光社在打击了邪气之后，及时召开了干部会议和贫农、下中农会议进行总结，进一步巩固和壮大阶级队伍。由于做了这一系列的工作，社里出现了新的面貌，突出的表现在如下几方面：第一，生产积极性提高，出勤率从60％增到95％以上。第二，向社支钱的人从每天二十多人减到五、六人，一时支不到钱的也能体谅社的困难而不吵闹，干群关系也密切起来了。第三，社员积极归还银行贷款，一个晚上便报还贷款六百九十九元。第四，干部劲头足，信心高，曾经公开提出辞职的社主任、会计、出纳等人表示要坚决干下去。
    龙光社向社员进行社会主义教育工作，虽然还是初步开展，但已取得不少效果，这说明要搞好农村工作，办好合作社，那就必须坚决依靠贫农和下中农，坚持党在农村中的阶级路线。
