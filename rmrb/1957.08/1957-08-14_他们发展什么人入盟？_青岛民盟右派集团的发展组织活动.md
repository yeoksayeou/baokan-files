What Kind of People Do They Recruit?
—The Organizational Activities of the Qingdao China Democratic League Rightist Group in Developing Members
By Our Reporter Xiang Cun

The China Democratic League (CDL) rightist group in Qingdao, headed by Chen Yangzhi, vice chairman of the CDL, and formed by rightist elements such as Xue Yinong, deputy director of the organization department, is a stronghold of the Zhang-Luo alliance in Qingdao.

Since this rightist clique basically took shape in August of last year, it has effectively controlled all the leadership of the CDL Qingdao Municipal Committee, completely monopolizing the organizational work of developing new members. They sought out targets of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, those dissatisfied with the Party, and backward elements to join the CDL, using them as their political capital. They concentrated their efforts on seizing control of the organization department first. Using means of enticement such as banquets, outings, and personal visits, they have developed 415 new members in the past year or so, exceeding the total number of members developed in the previous six years and nine months by more than 13%.

Among these members who were massively absorbed into the CDL, those who have been exposed as rightist elements now account for more than 70% of all rightist elements in the Qingdao CDL organization. In the tide of the anti-rightist struggle, it is evident that twenty of the forty-eight grassroots organizations of the CDL in the city have been completely controlled by rightist elements.

After the principle of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" was put forward, Chen Yangzhi, this political pickpocket (after liberation, he falsely reported a list of underground CDL members to claim credit), and his rightist clique, under the guidance of the black line of the Zhang-Luo alliance, completely broke away from the leadership of the Party and "independently" developed a large number of members. In particular, after the CDL National Working Conference in April, Chen Yangzhi accepted the task of developing 1,000 members this year from the "Central Committee" of the Zhang-Luo alliance, the mass development work led to a climax. They openly stated that as long as there were no current counter-revolutionary activities, and as long as historical counter-revolutionaries were not treated as counter-revolutionaries in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries campaign, they could be accepted into the CDL. Under the instruction of the rightist clique, the CDL branch of the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao Medical College even admitted a person known to have political problems into the CDL and soon promoted him to a leadership position. When someone raised objections, Xue Yinong said nonchalantly, "It's all the same anyway."

Why are they so keen on finding these people to join the CDL? As Xue Yinong himself said, "When I see comrades who have been struggled against in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, I feel particularly close to them." Xue Yinong also said, "If we grasp these people, we will have a strong mass base." Among the 42 CDL members developed by the Qingdao Textile Bureau and four other units from January to May 1956, 14 had been struggled against during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and 12 have been initially exposed as rightist elements. According to investigations in the 15th and 17th middle schools, of the 16 CDL members developed since 1955, 10 were targets of struggle in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries.

Middle schools are the focus of the rightist clique's development of members and an important stronghold they have chosen to attack the Party. In the high-speed development of members, they criticized the past practice of "focusing on developing progressive intellectuals." In addition to proposing to focus on developing over-age members of the Communist Youth League to join the CDL, they particularly emphasized opening the door to backward elements. Zhang Yanchao (a teacher at the 15th Middle School), who was recognized as a backward element in the Qingdao secondary education system, was regarded by the rightist clique as a representative figure and was approved to join the CDL, bypassing the group review process. Zhang Yanchao himself had no requirements to join the CDL, but because he often confronted the Party, Chen Yangzhi greatly appreciated this point. On the one hand, he actively helped him find a partner, and on the other hand, he instructed the rightist element Lin Hongzhu to strengthen contact and encourage him to fill out an application form to join the CDL. After Zhang Yanchao joined the CDL, Xue Yinong also instructed the CDL grassroots organization of the 15th Middle School to summarize and promote his so-called "changes" before and after joining the CDL as a typical experience. Facts have proved that Zhang Yanchao is an out-and-out rightist element.

The rightist clique adopted such a policy of developing the organization that they even absorbed some social dregs as members of the CDL. It is understood that among the 33 middle schools in the city, only the 18th and 23rd middle schools do not have CDL members; other middle schools have established CDL grassroots organizations. These organizations have become the outpost of the rightist clique in middle schools to oppose the Communist Party and socialism.

In order to cater to the tastes of some intellectuals, the rightist clique repeatedly used slogans such as "the CDL represents the interests of intellectuals" and "the CDL is the mother's home of intellectuals" through methods such as "CDL-mass meetings" to encourage intellectuals to talk about their "inner thoughts" and cleverly expand the ranks of the CDL rightist clique. They also organized a science and technology group composed of scientific and technical personnel. In name, it was to study current affairs and policies, but in reality, it spread dissatisfaction with the Party and disseminated hearsay "street news." They held meetings every two weeks, and each time they had to eat candy, and the whole group quickly became CDL members. Through the individual connections of the members of the "Science and Technology Group," they further developed many CDL members. The rightist element Wu Yiting (director of the capital construction department of the Qingdao Textile Bureau) single-handedly contacted some like-minded engineering and technical personnel and developed 20 CDL members from January to June.

In order to develop rapidly, the rightist clique also simplified many procedures for joining the CDL and abolished the requirement that CDL members must be discussed and approved by the CDL Municipal Committee before joining the CDL. For some people with historical problems, under the slogan of "it is better to have them in the CDL than outside the CDL," they changed the procedure to fill out an application form before writing an autobiography or explaining the problem. Any CDL member pulled in by a rightist element could not only be approved out of order, but also be approved as long as Chen Yangzhi and Xue Yinong "nodded."

The conspiratorial activities of this rightist clique in organizational development have now been completely exposed.

    他们发展什么人入盟？
    ——青岛民盟右派集团的发展组织活动
    本报记者　向村
    青岛市以民盟副主委陈仰之为首、由组织部副部长薛艺农等右派分子结成的民盟右派集团，是章罗联盟在青岛的一个据点。
    这个右派小集团从去年8月基本形成后，实际上已控制了民盟市委的一切领导，完全把持了发展盟员的组织工作，他们物色一些肃反中的对象、对党不满分子和落后分子入盟，作为自己的政治资本。他们集中力量首先霸占了组织部，利用请客、野游、登门拜访等拉拢手段，近一年多来，发展了四百一十五名盟员，比过去六年零九个月发展的盟员总数还超过了13％。
    这些被大量吸收入盟的盟员中，目前已被揭发出的右派分子，即占青岛民盟组织全部右派分子的70％以上。全市民盟的四十八个基层组织，在反右派斗争的浪潮中，明显的看出已有二十个基层单位，完全被右派分子所控制。
      “长期共存，互相监督”的方针提出后，陈仰之这个政治扒手（解放后他曾假造地下盟员名单报功）及其右派集团，在章罗联盟一条黑线的牵引下，完全摆脱了党的领导，“独立”地大量发展盟员。特别是民盟4月全国工作会议后，陈仰之从章罗联盟的“盟中央”，接受了今年发展盟员一千名的任务后，大量发展工作引向了高潮。他们公开提出：只要没有现行反革命活动，历史反革命只要在肃反运动中不以反革命论处者，均可接收入盟。青岛医学院附属医院民盟支部，在右派集团的授意下，甚至吸收了一个明知有政治问题的人入盟，不久又提至领导岗位。当有人提出反对意见时，薛艺农满不在乎地说：“反正是那么回事”。
    他们为什么热中于找这些人入盟呢？正如薛艺农自己说：“见了肃反中被斗过的同志，觉得格外亲热”。薛艺农还说：“抓住这些人，我们就有强大的群众基础”。青岛纺织管理局等四个单位，1956年1至5月份共发展的四十二名盟员，其中在肃反时被斗的即有十四人，目前初步揭露出的右派分子，也已有十二人。十五、十七两个中学的调查，自1955年以来共发展十六个盟员，有十名就是肃反中的斗争对象。
    中等学校是右派集团发展盟员的重点，也是他们选定的向党进攻的重要据点。在高速度地发展盟员中，他们批判了过去“偏重于发展进步知识分子”的做法，除了提出抓紧发展超龄团员入盟外，特别强调向落后分子开门。全市中等教育界公认的落后分子张彦超（十五中教员），就是被右派集团视为有代表性的人物，并且越过小组被批准入盟。张彦超本身并没有什么入盟要求，只是因为他经常与党对抗，陈仰之就十分欣赏他这一点，于是一方面积极帮助他找爱人，一方面授意右派分子林鸿翥加强联系，动员他填表入盟。张彦超入盟后，薛艺农还责成十五中民盟基层组织，将他入盟前后的所谓“变化”，作为典型经验加以总结推广。事实已经证明，张彦超是一个不折不扣的右派分子。
    右派集团采取这样的发展组织的方针，甚至把某些社会渣滓也吸收为民盟的成员。据了解，全市三十三个中等学校，只有十八中、二十三中还没有民盟成员外，其他中学都建立了民盟基层组织。这些组织成为右派集团在中学内反共反社会主义的前哨据点。
    为了迎合某些知识分子的口味，右派集团一再以“民盟是代表知识分子的利益”，“民盟是知识分子的娘家”等口号通过“盟群会”等方式，鼓励知识分子谈“心里话”，巧妙地扩展民盟右派集团的队伍。他们还组织了一个由科学技术人员参加的科学技术小组。名义上是学习时事政策，实际上散布对党不满，传播道听途说的“马路新闻”。他们每二周开一次会，每次必吃糖果，全组很快都成了盟员。通过“科学技术小组”成员的个人串连，又进一步发展了不少盟员。右派分子吴怡庭（青岛纺织管理局基建处长）单线串连了一些气味相投的工程技术人员，从1至6月份，就发展了二十名盟员。
    为了发展迅速，右派集团还简化了许多入盟手续，取消了盟员入盟要由盟市委讨论通过的规定。对一些有历史问题的人，在“摆在盟内比在盟外好”的口号下，改变为填表入盟后再写自传，或再交代问题。凡是右派分子拉进来的盟员，不仅可以越级批准，而且只要陈仰之、薛艺农一“点头”就算批准了。
    这个右派集团在发展组织上的阴谋活动现在已彻底被揭穿了。
