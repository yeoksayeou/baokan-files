    As the train was about to leave, a young man jumped on, attracting everyone's attention. He wore a steel helmet-style white sun hat; a string of keys was tied around his waist, and the handle of a short knife was also exposed; he wore khaki-colored suit pants, with the narrow trouser legs tucked into a pair of elaborate high-top leather boots; the shirt material was shiny and somewhat fluttering. In short, this person's attire was peculiar. The man's face was purely southern-type, with fair skin, black hair, and elegant demeanor. The school badge on his chest indicated his identity: a university student.
    The university student sat down opposite an old expert, and they quickly struck up a conversation. It turned out that the old expert had also taught at this university three years ago, and was very familiar with that city and some of the teachers and students of the university. They talked about some of the historical sites there, the library, and also the theater.
    "Where are you going? Isn't the school still on holiday?" the expert asked.
    "I'm going to a normal university in another city to deliver a message," the university student said with a seemingly modest smile, "to introduce the experience of our school in helping the Party with the rectification campaign to them. I heard that they haven't started the blooming and contending there yet."
      "Hmm hmm hmm... very good... very good... we should help the Party with the rectification." The expert rubbed the fleshy pouches under his eyelids and answered the young man simply.
    The young man didn't speak immediately. A burst of laughter came from the other end of the carriage, coupled with the sound of drinking tea around them, which made the young man's fair face show an expression of annoyance.
    "What major are you studying?" the expert asked.
    "Law, Class 3 of the fourth year."
    "Do you know a classmate named Ye Yuzheng?"
    "Yes, yes, Ye Yuzheng, little bird—that's what our whole class calls her."
    "How are her studies? Don't the students have a bad impression of her?" the expert asked, his face glowing with satisfaction.
    "That's right... indeed... she's too beautiful, one of the most beautiful in our whole school. She has a classical face shape, big black eyes. Her hair hangs down to her slender waist, her movements and voice are light and lively, her figure and dress show the charm that modern poets find in medieval statuettes, and those eyes show a kind of Christ-like tenderness and forbearance. Oh, oh, compared to her classmates, she is a pretty, charming, and poetic girl. In the joy of the ball, the pink tones on her face stir up people's dizziness..."
    "Young man," the expert became uneasy and didn't want to listen anymore, "how can there be so many inaccurate words in your beautiful dictionary!"
    The university student looked around, smiled with satisfaction, and said:
    "Beautiful life, my love with her has been going on for half a year, she loves me so much," he said softly, "a truly magical woman, two months ago she asked me to go boating on the lake, we spent a sacred night."
    "It shouldn't be to this extent, she's still young," the expert said stammeringly, staring at him with wide eyes.
    "That's right... indeed... she's young, but how can I not love her? She has been tormented so much in recent years. Her elderly parents were betrayed, her mother was imprisoned alive, her father was sentenced to reform through labor for three years, and now he's wandering the streets repairing watches, ha ha, an American student repairing clocks on the streets."
    "You're lying!" the expert shouted angrily.
    "What's going on?" The university student, who had just been shrugging his shoulders and shaking his legs, now panicked and widened his eyes as well.
      "You're talking nonsense! I am her father, and I have been a professor for eight years since liberation. My wife is also healthy and alive, and goes to work at the Municipal Women's Federation every day."
    "I'm saying..." the university student stammered.
    "May I ask what you are going to convey to the Normal University?"
    "To convey the experience of our school in helping the Party with the rectification campaign."
    "You lying rogue!"
    "I, no..."
    "You don't deserve to say those words just now."
    "I, no..."
    The passengers in the carriage all gathered around them, and one of the passengers said:
    "Mr. University Student, are you going to the Normal University to start a fire?"
    "Yes, start a fire!" the expert agreed.
    "How active, starting a fire in the train too," that passenger continued.
    The university student's face was flushed red, and the blood vessels on his neck also swelled up. He hesitated, and when the train stopped at a small station, he pushed through the crowd and hurriedly jumped off the train.
    The angry crowd shouted behind him:
    "That shameful university student!"
    "Rightist element!"
    People looked at the receding white sun hat with contempt.
    The old expert sighed and sat down again.

    腐烂
    崔左夫
    火车将开的时候，跳上来一个年轻人，把大家吸引住了。他戴着一顶钢盔式的白色遮阳帽；腰间系着一串钥匙，还露出一把短刀柄；米黄色的西装裤，窄窄的裤筒塞在一双考究的长筒皮靴里；衬衫的料子发亮而有些飘忽忽的。总之，这人服饰奇特。这人的脸是纯粹南方型的，白皮肤，黑头发，风度翩翩。他胸前的校徽表明了他的身份：大学生。
    这大学生在一位老专家对面落座了，他们很快攀谈起来。原来老专家三年前也在这个大学教过书，很熟悉那个城市和这大学的一些师生。他们彼此谈起那儿的一些古迹，图书馆，也谈到戏院。
    “你到哪里去呢？学校不是还没有放假吗？”专家问。
    “我是去别的城市的一个师范大学做传达的，”大学生仿佛谦虚地微微一笑，说：“把我们学校里帮助党整风的经验介绍给他们，听说他们那里还没有鸣放起来。”
      “嗯嗯嗯……要得要得……应该帮助党整风。”专家用手指揉了揉眼皮下面的肉囊，简单地应答了年轻人。
    年轻人没有马上开口。车厢的另一端传来一阵笑声，加上周围喝茶的声音，使得年轻人白晰晰的脸上现出厌烦的神情。
    “你是读哪个专业的？”专家问。
    “法律系，四年三班。”
    “你认得一位叶腴正同学？”
    “认得认得，叶腴正姑娘，小鸟儿，——我们全班这样称呼她。”
    “她的功课怎样？同学们对她反映还不坏吧？”专家问，他脸上满意得放光。
    “对了，……的确，……她太漂亮啦，算得上我们全校最漂亮的。她有古典的脸型，大大的黑眼睛。她的头发垂到纤瘦的腰上，她的动作和声音都是轻灵活泼的，她的身材和装束，表现出近代诗人在中世纪小雕像上找到的妩媚，那双眼睛啊，显现出一种基督式的温柔和隐忍。噢噢，同她的同学比较，她是俊俏的，迷人的，诗意的女郎。在舞会的情欢里，她那脸上的粉红色的色调，鼓动着人的昏旋……”
    “年轻人，”专家不安起来，不愿意再听下去，“在你的美丽的字典里怎么有这许多不确切的字眼！”
    大学生往四下里瞧了一瞧，满意地微微一笑，说：
    “美妙的人生啊，我和她的恋爱已经继续了半年了，她是那么爱我，”他小声说，“真是神奇的女人，两个月前她约我去游湖，我们度过了神圣的一夜。”
    “这还不至于吧，她还年轻呢。”专家睁大着眼睛望着他，结结巴巴的说。
    “对了……的确……她年轻，但我怎么能不爱她呢，这几年来她已经被折磨得苦极了。她的年老的双亲被人出卖了，母亲被活活的关死了，父亲劳改了三年，现在流落在街头上修表，哈哈，一个美国留学生在街头上修钟表。”
    “你说谎！”专家怒恼得喊起来了。
    “这怎么搞的？”大学生刚才还耸着肩，摇着腿，现在却慌起来了，也睁大了眼睛。
      “你胡说！我就是她的父亲，解放八年来我一直担任教授，我的妻子也健康的活着，每天到市妇联去上班。”
    “我是说……”大学生支吾着。
    “请问你到师大去传达什么？”
    “传达我校帮助党整风的经验。”
    “你这说谎的流氓！”
    “我，不……”
    “你不配说刚才那样的话。”
    “我，不……”
    车厢里的旅客都簇集到他们的周围了，旅客之一说话了：
    “大学生先生，你是到师大去点火的吧？”
    “对，点火！”专家同意。
    “多积极啊，在火车里也点起火来了。”那位旅客继续说。
    大学生满脸通红，脖子上的血管也胀大了。他疑迟着，当火车在一个小站上停靠后，他挤开人群匆匆跳下了火车。
    愤怒的人群在他的背后嚷起来：
    “这可耻的大学生！”
    “右派分子！”
    人们用轻蔑的目光瞧着那顶走远了的白色遮阳帽。
    老专家叹了一口气，重新坐下来。
