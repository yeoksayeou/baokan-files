    Bai Shou and Zhang Xueqin's Conspiracy Exposed

    (Reported by Anhui Daily) The rightist elements Bai Shou (original name Hui Rongjie, also known as Hui Jie) and Zhang Xueqin from the Anhui People's Publishing House launched a frenzied attack against the Party during the rectification campaign. However, their conspiracy was soon exposed by the broad masses.

    As soon as the rectification movement began, Bai Shou made malicious slanders against the Party at internal meetings. He said, "The Party organization of the publishing house is very cold and a bureaucratic organization, which is inseparable from the bureaucratic leadership of the higher-level Party committee." Bai Shou believed that "the Party is carrying out sectarian education among activists," and even believed that "the Party in the publishing house does not educate Party members at all, but only teaches Party members to separate themselves from the masses." He also said, "Activists are all yes-men, flatterers, whisperers, and echoers." Bai Shou also wanted to get rid of the leadership of the Party and the administration. He demanded unlimited expansion of the editors' power in their work, so that the editors could make their own decisions from the selection of topics to the publication of books.

    At that time, many anti-Party and anti-socialist big-character posters appeared in the publishing house, and Bai Shou was very interested in them. He wrote a reader's notes under a pseudonym, saying that those who wrote these big-character posters "can all be called 'meritorious officials' of the Party and the state."

    Bai Shou妄想妄想 to incite Party members to rebel against the Party, and also posted a slogan that read: "Communist Party members! Abandon the idea of ​​'sticking your head out and getting criticized,' please—stand up and speak freely!" Later, he directed other rightist elements to question whether the Party had made a decision to restrict Party members from speaking out, directly threatening Party members that "if you don't make any suggestions," he would "attack" them.

    The rightist element Zhang Xueqin colluded with Bai Shou from the very beginning of the rectification movement. He said that Party members and activists are all impersonal formulaic figures. He wrote a big-character poster entitled "The Publishing House Should No Longer Cultivate Servants" (he did not dare to post this big-character poster). He said that he admired Liu Shahe's "Grass and Trees." He also said that Lin Xiling was "talented," Zhang Bojun was a "person with political ideals," and Chu Anping's fallacy of "Party World" was "reasonable." When he saw the self-criticism of rightist elements in the newspaper, he said that these people were all "cowards who are afraid of death"; when he saw Feng Yuanchu sponsoring Chu Anping's fallacy, he said that Feng Yuanchu was "truly brave." He defended another rightist element in the publishing house's theory of "more harm than good in the anti-rebellion campaign." When various absurd remarks were refuted in the publishing house, he and Bai Shou and others made wild remarks, saying that this was "hindering the great blooming and great contending, and the rectification movement is developing in an unhealthy direction." They insulted comrades who expressed fair opinions as "insincere and of low character," and openly proposed that the leadership should rectify the "saints" who expressed fair opinions.

    Now, the rightist elements Bai Shou and Zhang Xueqin have been completely exposed under the exposure of the staff of the Anhui People's Publishing House. All the staff are in high spirits and are pursuing them.

    白手、张雪芹的阴谋败露
    本报讯　据安徽日报报道：安徽人民出版社的编辑白手（原名惠荣杰、又名惠杰）和张雪芹这两个右派分子，在整风期间向党发动了一场猖狂的进攻。然而为时不久，他们的阴谋即为广大群众所识破。
    整风运动刚刚开始，白手就在社内座谈会上对党进行恶毒的污蔑。他说，“出版社的党组织非常冷酷，是个官僚主义化了的组织，这与上级党委的官僚领导是分不开的。”白手认为“党在积极分子中进行宗派主义教育”，甚至认为“出版社的党对党员没有任何教育，只教导党员脱离群众”。并说，“积极分子都是些唯唯诺诺、逢迎拍马、说小话、应声虫”。白手还想摆脱党和行政的领导。他要求无限制地扩大编辑在工作中的权力，从订选题到出书完全由编辑自行作主。
    当时，社内出现了不少反党反社会主义的大字报，白手非常感到兴趣。他化名写了一篇读报杂谈，说是写这些大字报的“都可以称为党和国家的‘功臣’”。
    白手妄想煽动党员同志起来叛党，还张贴了一条标语，写道：“共产党员们！丢掉‘伸头挨整’的思想，请——站起来畅所欲言！”以后，他又指挥其他右派分子，责问党是否有限制党员鸣放的决定，直接威胁党员“如果再不提意见”就要“攻击”他了。
    右派分子张雪芹在整风运动一开始就同白手相互勾结，狼狈为奸。他说党员、积极分子都是毫无个性的公式人物。他写了一张大字报，标题是“出版社不要再培养奴才”（这张大字报他未敢贴出）。他说，他欣赏流沙河的“草木篇”。并说，林希翎有“才干”，章伯钧是一个“有政治理想的人物”，储安平的“党天下”谬论“言之有理”。他看到报上右派分子的检讨，则说这些人都是“贪生怕死之辈”；他看到凤元初赞助储安平的谬论，则说凤元初是“真正的勇敢”。他为出版社另一右派分子的“肃反害多利少”论作辩护。当各种荒谬言论在出版社受到驳斥时，他和白手等人大放厥词，说这是“妨害大鸣大放，整风运动是在朝着不健康的方向发展”。他们辱骂发表公正意见的同志是“言不由衷、人格卑下”，并公然提出要领导上治一治发表公正意见的“圣人”。
    现在，右派分子白手和张雪芹在安徽人民出版社职工的揭露下已经丑形毕露。全社职工斗志昂扬，正在对他们进行追击。
