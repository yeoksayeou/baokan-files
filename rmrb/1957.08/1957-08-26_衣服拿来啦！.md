　　"The clothes are here!"
    One day, it was drizzling. Several members of the Chuansha County Sewing Handicraft Cooperative in Jiangsu Province, carrying large bundles of clothes on their backs, went to the countryside to deliver and collect clothing for the farmers. Each of them wore small sleeves on their arms with "Service Personnel" written on them, and they also carried small flags that said "Serve the Farmers," trudging laboriously along the muddy paths.
    They entered Xinmin Township, and the township immediately became lively. Some farmers excitedly surrounded them, shouting, and others ran around spreading the word: "The clothes are here!" "Don't leave, I still have a large gown to alter into a youth suit."
    The cooperative director heard the noise and came out to greet them warmly: "Comrades, you've worked hard, the roads are difficult to travel on in the rain." The sewing cooperative members replied with a smile: If it weren't for weather like this, we'd probably be meeting with "door nails" [being turned away]. They chatted and laughed as they entered the house. Several large bundles were opened, and all kinds of colorful clothes were displayed before them. The farmers took out their beloved clothes based on their receipts. A girl put on the altered dress and skirt and asked her sister with a smile, "Does it fit?" An older woman complained that the sleeves were a little long, making it inconvenient for her to work, and the service personnel promised to take it back for alterations and deliver it again. An old man pulled a service worker aside, discussing whether it would be better to alter a long gown into a Zhongshan suit or two pairs of Western-style pants. Suddenly, an old woman rushed in with a very old linen long gown, saying: "Comrade, I can't take my child to the city, this gown has been locked in the bottom of my trunk for over fifty years. I wonder if it can be altered into children's clothing?" The service worker came over, looked at it carefully, and then tore a bit off the edge of the fabric. Then, he said, "It's still sturdy, it can be altered into five undershirts." The old woman couldn't quite believe her ears and asked:
  "How many can be altered?" The service worker, thinking she was deaf, held up five fingers and said, "Five, it can be altered into five." The old woman was extremely happy and went back to tell everyone: "My fifty-year-old clothes can be used! The Communist Party is always thinking of the farmers, even sewing clothes with us in mind."
    The Chuansha County Sewing Handicraft Cooperative has one hundred and thirty-six members, who regularly take turns going to the countryside to sew and alter clothes for the farmers. In the past three months alone, they have sewn more than 18,900 pieces of clothing for the farmers, of which more than 7,400 were altered from old clothes. This not only saves the country a lot of cotton cloth, but also increases the income of handicraft cooperative members during the off-season. Before going to the countryside, members earned an average of thirty yuan per month, but after going to the countryside, it increased to forty yuan.

### “衣服拿来啦！”

　　“衣服拿来啦！”
    一天，下着蒙蒙细雨。江苏省川沙县缝纫手工业联社几个社员背着大包衣服，下乡给农民包送包收去。他们每个人的手臂戴着小套，套上写着“服务员”，还拿着“为农民服务”的小旗子，在泥泞的小路上艰难地走着。
    他们走进新民乡，乡里立刻热闹起来，有的农民兴高采烈地围着他们嚷，有的奔走相呼：“衣服拿来啦！”“不要走，我还有件大挂改成青年装。”
    社主任闻声出来，热情地招呼他们：“同志，辛苦啦，下雨天路不好走。”缝纫社社员笑着回答：要不是这样的天气来，恐怕我们要碰“门钉”了。他们说笑着走进屋子里去。把几个大包袱打开，五光十色的各种各样衣服，展现在眼前。农民们凭发票取出自己心爱的衣服。一个姑娘把翻改好的衣裙穿上，笑眯眯地问她姊姊：“合适吗？”一个大嫂子嫌袖子有点长，做活不便，服务员答应拿回去修改再送来。一位老头子拉着一个服务员，商量一件长衫改成一套中山装好还是改两条西装裤好？忽然，一个老太太拿着一件很古老的夏布长衫，匆匆忙忙走进来就说：“同志，我不能带孩儿进城去，我这件长衫锁在箱底五十多年啦，不知还能改成孩子衣服不成？”服务员走过来打开看了又看，又在衣边上撕了一下，然后说：“还结实，可以改成五件汗衫。”老太太有点不相信自己的耳朵，问道：
  “能改几件？”服务员以为她是个聋子，便伸出五个手指头说：“五件，能改五件。”老太太高兴极了，回去见人就说：我的五十多年衣服用得上啦！共产党处处为农民，连缝衣服也为咱们着想。”
    川沙县缝纫手工业联社有一百三十六个社员，经常这样轮流下乡给农民缝制和翻旧改新衣服。仅最近三个多月，便给农民缝制了一万八千九百多件衣服，其中有七千四百多件衣服是翻旧改新的。这不仅为国家节约了不少棉布，还使手工业社社员淡季增加收入。未下乡前社员平均每月收入三十元，下乡后增加到四十元了。
