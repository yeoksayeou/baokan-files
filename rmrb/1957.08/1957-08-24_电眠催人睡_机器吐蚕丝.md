　　Soviet scientists have recently invented a hypnosis device that looks very much like a radio called "Electrosleep." Its two electrode contact points are placed on the eyelids and the back of the head of the insomniac, respectively. When a pulsed current is applied, a slight groping sensation, as if a thin layer of mustard paste has been applied, is generated on the eyelids. After two or three minutes, the power is slightly increased, the sensation gradually disappears, and one falls into a deep sleep. Generally, insomniacs can fall asleep in just eight to twelve minutes. People who have undergone this electric hypnosis during the day will not only not have their sleep disturbed at night, but will also sleep more soundly.

    In some of the Soviet Union's new man-made fiber factories, an interesting machine has recently appeared – the "Machine Silkworm." It spins 1,700 kilograms of rayon per day and night, equivalent to the silk spun by four million silkworms in their lifetime. Moreover, it only takes six minutes to complete the processes of processing, twisting, drying, and other processes on the silk it spins.
    The "Machine Silkworm" spins a viscose silk. About 160 kilograms of viscose silk can be made from one cubic meter of wood after it is processed.

    Swedish engineers recently successfully tested a method to prevent waterways from freezing in winter. The method is to lay plastic pipes with holes in the bottom of the waterway. Then, compressed air is forced into the pipes, and the air rushes out of the pipe holes, causing the warm currents at the bottom of the water to rotate upwards and dissolve the ice layer on the surface of the water. Using this method can reduce icebreaking costs and ensure normal navigation of merchant ships.

    American scientists have recently invented a new type of paper that can be used to package food to prevent it from spoiling. It is cheaper than the metal foil paper usually used to package food.
    This paper is called enzyme-soaked paper, and it is made by immersing ordinary paper in glucose oxidase and catalase. Because the glucose enzyme can interact with oxygen in the atmosphere, the oxygen in the atmosphere cannot invade the food and cause it to spoil.

　　电眠催人睡　机器吐蚕丝
    苏联科学家最近发明了一种很像收音机的催眠器——“电眠”。把它的两个电极接触点分别放在失眠者的眼皮和后脑上，通上脉冲电流，眼皮上就会产生好像涂上了一层薄芥末膏似的轻微摸索的感觉。两、三分钟以后，稍微增大电力，感觉逐渐消失，就沉沉入睡了。一般失眠者只要八分到十二分钟就能入睡。在白天受过这种电催眠的人，晚间的睡眠非但不会受到妨碍，而且还会睡得更香甜。

    苏联一些新型的人造纤维工厂里，最近出现了一种有趣的机器——“机器蚕”。它一昼夜吐出来的人造丝达一千七百公斤，等于四百万条蚕一生中所吐出来的丝，而且它只要六分钟就能对它吐出来的丝完成加工、捻线、烘干等工序。
    “机器蚕”吐出的是一种粘液丝，一立方公尺的木材经过它加工以后，大约可以制成一百六十公斤的粘液丝。

    瑞典工程师不久前试验成功了一种使航路在冬天不冻冰的方法。办法是在航路的水底敷设有孔的塑胶管。然后，把压缩空气压入管内，空气从管孔冲出，使水底暖流旋转上升，溶解水面上的冰层。使用这种方法能够减低破冰费用，并且保证商船的正常通航。

    美国科学家最近发明了一种新型的纸张，用它来包装食品，可以使食品不致变坏，它的价格要比平时包装食品用的金属箔纸便宜。
    这种纸称为酶浸纸，它是用普通的纸张在葡萄糖氧化酶和过氧化氢酶中浸渍制成的。因为有了葡萄糖酶就能够和大气中的氧发生作用，使大气中的氧无法侵入食品而使食品变坏。
