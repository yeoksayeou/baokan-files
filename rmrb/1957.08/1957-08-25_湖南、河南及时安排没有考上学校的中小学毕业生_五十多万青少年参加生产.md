Changsha, August 22nd (reporting for this newspaper) - In Hunan Province, 200,000 primary and secondary school graduates who did not pass the school entrance examinations have settled down in the countryside, and some younger graduates who are unable to engage in production labor have joined self-study organizations.

The Party and government organs in various places have carried out excellent organizational arrangements for students participating in production. In Fuchong Township, Wugang County, the agricultural cooperatives assigned younger graduates to raise pigs and graze cattle, and some junior high school graduates were hired as teachers in people-run schools or instructors for Communist Youth League classes. Yao Gongtan Agricultural Cooperative in Shenshuigang Township, Taoyuan County, sent several experienced veteran farmers to lead and train graduates to learn agricultural production techniques.

In addition to assigning some graduates to various industries for production, relevant departments in various towns and cities also organized qualified students to go to rural areas for production. Changsha, Hengyang, and five other cities are preparing to mobilize 1,200 to 2,000 graduates who cannot continue their studies to go to the countryside for production. The first batch of 222 people in Changsha City left for Yuanjiang, Huarong, Anxiang, and four other counties in the countryside on August 18 to settle down.

In addition to organizing students who did not pass the school entrance examinations to go to the countryside for production, various localities have also adopted methods such as encouraging the masses to run schools collectively and organizing self-study to arrange for graduates who are younger and do not have the conditions to engage in production. Hengnan, Shaodong, and 21 other counties have prepared to run 42 tutorial classes and schools. The five tutorial schools in Changsha City have already enrolled 1,650 new students this year. Some factories and enterprises in Xiangtan have jointly run two private secondary schools.

This newspaper also reports: The admission results of secondary schools in Henan Province have been announced, and more than 360,000 rural graduates who were not admitted have happily returned to their hometowns, and more than 90% of the graduates have received preliminary arrangements.

In recent months, especially in the past month, cities and rural areas have mobilized and organized various propaganda forces, using various flexible forms, to conduct propaganda and education for graduating students and their parents. Many areas such as Shangqiu and Luoyang have also organized reporting groups to go to various places to give lectures, so that the broad masses of people can understand the nature and tasks of general education, and the reason why not every graduate can continue their studies.

During the wheat harvest holiday, when students returned to their hometowns, various places organized graduates to participate in production labor, introduced the situation of agricultural cooperatives, and solicited opinions on participating in production. After the entrance examinations, various townships and cooperatives made specific arrangements based on the specific situation of the graduates and the needs of work. Therefore, when students received the notice of not being admitted, the townships and cooperatives made timely arrangements and provided care and assistance to them politically and in production. Agricultural cooperatives in Xuchang, Yanshi, Kaifeng, and other counties have also established technical night schools, hiring experienced veteran farmers or technicians to give lectures, and the Party and Communist Youth League branches give them Party and League lessons. In order to meet their technical research requirements, Chuwang Cooperative in Neihuang County allocated land for production experiments. According to preliminary statistics from the province, 23 private senior high school classes, 1,083 junior high school classes, and 383 primary school classes have been established. In addition, many spare-time middle schools, technical research groups, and self-study groups have also been established. After labor education, students have a correct understanding of participating in production and have great enthusiasm for labor.

Most of the more than 60,000 graduates in cities who were not admitted have also been settled. The first batch of students from Zhengzhou and Anyang have already gone to the countryside, and graduates from Luoyang and Xinxiang are preparing to go to the countryside. For younger students, government organs, factories, mines, and streets have not only established many cooperative middle schools and private middle schools, but also used the equipment of existing regular middle schools to establish many night schools, tutorial classes, etc., to absorb them to continue their studies.

    湖南、河南及时安排没有考上学校的中小学毕业生
　　五十多万青少年参加生产
    本报长沙22日电　湖南省有二十万没有考上学校的中小学毕业生已下乡安家落户，一部分年龄较小不能从事生产劳动的毕业生则参加了自学组织。
    各地党政机关为参加生产的学生进行了很好的组织安排工作。武冈县扶冲乡的各农业社，将年龄较小的毕业生分配去养猪、放牛，有的初中毕业生还被聘为民校教师或团课教员。桃源县深水港乡姚公潭农业社，派了几个有经验的老农负责带领和培养毕业生学会农业生产技术。
    各城镇有关部门，除安插一部分毕业生加入各行业生产外，并组织有条件的学生到农村生产。长沙、衡阳等七市，准备动员一千二百名到二千名不能升学的毕业生下乡生产。长沙市第一批二百二十二人已于8月18日分赴沅江、华容、安乡等七县农村安家落户。
    各地除了组织没考上学校的学生下乡生产外，并采取了鼓励群众集体办学和组织自学等方式，安排那些年龄较小和没有从事生产条件的毕业生。衡南、邵东等二十三县筹办补习班、校四十二所。长沙市的五所补习学校今年已经招了一千六百五十名新生。湘潭的一些工厂、企业单位，合办了两所民办中学。
    本报讯　河南省各中等学校招生已经发榜，三十六万多名未被录取的农村毕业生已愉快回乡，90％以上的毕业生已得到了初步安置。
    最近几个月，特别是近一个月，城市和农村动员和组织了各种宣传力量，运用各种灵活形式，对应届毕业生和学生家长进行了宣传教育。商丘、洛阳等许多地区还组织了报告团分赴各地巡回报告，使广大群众了解了普通教育的性质、任务、毕业生不能人人升学的道理。
    麦假期间，学生回乡时，各地组织毕业生进行了生产劳动，介绍了农业社的情况，征求参加生产的意见。升学考试后，各地乡社根据毕业生的具体情况和工作需要作了具体的安置计划。因此，当学生接到未被录取的通知书后，乡社及时地进行了安排，并且从政治上生产上多方面关怀帮助他们。许昌、偃师、开封等县的农业社还成立了技术夜校，聘请有经验的老农或技术员讲课，党、团支部给他们上党、团课。为满足他们研究技术的要求，内黄县楚旺社拨出生产实验地。据全省初步统计，已办民办高中班二十三个，初中班一千零八十三个，小学班三百八十三个。此外还举办了不少业余中学、技术研究小组、自学小组等。经过劳动教育，学生对参加生产有了正确的认识，劳动劲头很大。
    城市未被录取的六万多毕业生，绝大部分也都得到了安置。郑州、安阳市第一批学生已经下乡，洛阳、新乡市毕业生正在准备下乡。对于年龄小的学生，机关、厂矿、街道除办了许多合作中学、私立中学外，还利用现有正规中学的设备，办了许多夜校、补习班等，吸收他们继续学习。（记实）
