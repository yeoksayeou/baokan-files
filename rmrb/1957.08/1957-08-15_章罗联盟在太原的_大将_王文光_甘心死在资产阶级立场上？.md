Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, August 12th: Wang Wenguang, the "general" of the Zhang-Luo alliance in Taiyuan and Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the China Democratic League (CDL) in Shanxi Province, was exposed by everyone at a joint meeting recently convened by the CDL organizations of Shanxi Province and Taiyuan City. He had no choice but to confess some of his reactionary words and deeds.

Wang Wenguang admitted that Pu Xixiu and Zeng Zhaolun had given him instructions when they came to Taiyuan to inspect. He said that when Pu Xixiu came to Taiyuan, she instructed him to pay attention to "grabbing newspapers and writing more articles." After accepting this task, he published inflammatory lyrics and articles in the "Shanxi League News," "Shanxi Daily," and "Spark," and actively prepared for the anti-Party and anti-people "Comrade Journal" with Ren Yi, the editor of "Cultural Weekly." Wang Wenguang also admitted that when Zeng Zhaolun came to Taiyuan, he told him that the "problem" at Shanxi Medical College was "serious" and "imminent;" and told him that "it was mainly caused by the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and the China Democratic League should speak out." Later, Wang Wenguang instructed Xu Bingzheng, his backbone member at Shanxi Medical College, and Li Yajin and Li Mei, his backbone members at Taiyuan Institute of Technology, to "boldly ignite the fire."

After Wang Wenguang refused to further confess his relationship with the right-wing group of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, the meeting read aloud a secret letter written by Wang Wenguang to Zhang Dongsun on September 20, 1949. In this secret letter, Wang Wenguang scolded those in the Central Committee of the China Democratic League who leaned towards the Party as "a few weak elements" and "hypocritical speculators." In this secret letter, he also offered advice to the right-wing of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, saying that for the right-wing, "discipline must be maintained, but it should also be flexible and persuasive, addressing both the mind and the matter," and for the Communist Party, "it is not appropriate to belittle oneself or echo others, so as not to harm the demeanor of a great man." After reading this secret letter, Wang Wenguang had no choice but to lower his head and admit his guilt. However, when everyone further questioned Wang Wenguang about this secret letter, he became furious and publicly yelled that he was prepared to "willingly die on the bourgeois standpoint." After everyone's angry accusations, he lowered his head and admitted that he was wrong, and promised to make a thorough confession next time.

    章罗联盟在太原的“大将”王文光
    甘心死在资产阶级立场上？
    据新华社太原12日电　章罗联盟在太原的“大将”、民盟山西省筹备委员会副主任委员王文光，在最近民盟山西省和太原市组织召开的一次联席会议上，经大家揭露，不得不交代出他的一些反动言行。
    王文光承认浦熙修、曾昭抡来太原视察时曾对他面授机宜。他说，浦熙修来太原时曾指示他注意“抓报纸，多写文章”。他接受了这个任务以后，就在“山西盟讯”、“山西日报”、“火花”上发表煽动性的词曲和文章，并积极和“文化周刊”编委任一的筹办反党反人民的
  “同仁刊物”。王文光还承认，曾昭抡来太原时，曾告诉他山西医学院的“问题严重”，“一触即发”；并告诉他“主要是肃反问题造成的，民盟应该出来说话”。以后，王文光就指示他在山西医学院的骨干分子徐秉正，在太原工学院的骨干分子李亚晋、李梅，要他们“大胆点火”。
    会议在王文光拒绝进一步交代他和民盟中央右派集团的关系以后，当场宣读了1949年9月20日王文光写给张东荪的一封密信。在这封密信里，王文光骂民盟中央靠拢党的人是“少数懦弱分子”、“虚伪投机”，他在这封密信中还对民盟中央右派献策说，对右派“纪律故须维持，也应刚柔相济，心物兼攻”，而对共产党“不宜妄自菲薄，人云亦云，以伤大丈夫之风度。”在宣读这封密信以后，王文光不得不低头认罪。但是当大家进一步就这封密信向王文光提出质问的时候，他竟老羞成怒，公然叫嚣他准备“甘心死在资产阶级的立场上”。经过大家愤怒指责以后，他才低下头来，承认他错了，并保证下次彻底交代。
