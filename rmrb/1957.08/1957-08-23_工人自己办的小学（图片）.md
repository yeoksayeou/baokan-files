　　Workers Run Their Own Primary School

　　Weitan Station on the Baolan Railway Line is a very remote small station. The staff of this station and the track maintenance team, in order to solve the schooling problem for their children, established a primary school themselves. The teachers at the school are family members with a junior high school education, and the school furniture is made by the track maintenance workers using discarded railway sleepers. Although the conditions at this primary school are very simple, the students' academic performance is not bad at all due to the teachers' enthusiastic teaching.

　　工人自己办的小学
    宝兰线渭滩车站是一个很偏僻的小站，这个站上和养路工区的职工为了解决自己子女的学习问题，自己办了一所小学。学校的教师由具有初中文化水平的家属担任，校具也由养路工人利用废枕木做成。这所小学的条件虽很简陋，但由于教师的热心教学，学生们的学习成绩并不差些。
    学生们正在上算术课。
    放学了，老师护送学生们回家。
