Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan: The Jingzhou Special District in Hubei Province is carrying out "Five Comparisons" education among farmers as part of its socialist education campaign. The "Five Comparisons" consist of: comparing socialist society with capitalist society; comparing the proletariat with the bourgeoisie; comparing the Communist Party with the Kuomintang; comparing being a member of an agricultural cooperative with being a hired hand for a landlord; and comparing the current system of unified purchase and supply with guaranteed supply, with the past exploitative practices of profiteering merchants who monopolized the market. Since the start of this education in mid-July, it has greatly stimulated the farmers' socialist political consciousness, and they have expressed their firm support for the Communist Party and their determination to take the socialist road.

A handful of landlord and rich peasant elements in the Dongsheng Agricultural Cooperative of Nanzhou Township, Mianyang County, attempted to usurp the leadership of the cooperative, privately appointing their own cooperative director, accountant, and work-point recorder, threatening cooperative cadres to step down, and even threatening to kill several production team leaders in the cooperative. After being exposed and struggled against by the cooperative members, they had to bow their heads and confess their crimes to the people.

    荆州专区开展“五比”教育
    据新华社武汉讯　湖北荆州专区在开展社会主义教育中，向农民进行“五比”教育。“五比”的内容是：社会主义社会与资本主义社会对比；无产阶级与资产阶级对比；共产党和国民党对比；当农业社社员和给地主当长工对比；现在实行统购统销、保证供应和过去的奸商重利盘剥、垄断市场对比。自7月中旬开始进行这一教育以后，大大激发了农民的社会主义政治觉悟，他们纷纷表示坚决拥护共产党，走社会主义的道路。
    沔阳县南州乡东升农业社一小撮地主、富农分子想篡夺合作社的领导权，私自安排了自己的社主任、会计、记工员，威胁社干部下台，扬言要杀社里几个生产队长。经过社员们的揭发和斗争，他们不得不向人民低头认罪。
