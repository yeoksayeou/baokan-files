Xinhua News Agency, August 14th: Rural grain sales nationwide should continue to be appropriately controlled to conserve grain consumption. This was stated to reporters by the person in charge of rural purchasing and marketing at the Ministry of Food. He said that rural grain supply work has been further improved over the past year, but some extra grain was also sold.

Over the past year (the 1956-1957 grain year), the state basically ascertained the situation of grain surplus and deficiency in rural areas. Timely supplies were made to grain-deficient cooperatives, households, and other non-agricultural populations, basically meeting their grain needs. At the same time, grain supplies to farmers in disaster areas were also guaranteed. In this year, the state sold a total of 40.1 billion jin of grain in rural areas, 6.9 billion jin more than the previous year. According to the analysis of the Ministry of Food, most of the extra 6.9 billion jin of grain sold was reasonably extra. Because the national disaster situation was serious last year, the task of supplying grain to disaster areas was very heavy. Last year alone, an extra 5.9 billion jin of grain (including disaster relief seed grain) was sold to the eight disaster-stricken provinces of Henan, Hebei, Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Hunan, Guangxi, and Jilin, accounting for more than 85% of the total extra grain sold, strongly supporting farmers in disaster areas to overcome difficulties. However, some of the grain sold was also unreasonable. According to the Ministry of Food's estimation, the unreasonably extra grain sold was about 1.5 to 2 billion jin. This part of the grain could have been saved if the work had been done well.

There were unreasonable phenomena in grain sales in disaster areas. The food rations in disaster areas were somewhat too generous. Last year, the average daily grain ration per person in disaster areas was one jin, which was two to four liang more than the average daily supply in disaster areas in the previous year. There were also unreasonable phenomena in grain sales in non-disaster areas. Especially in the second half of last year, many rural cadres and grain work cadres developed blindly optimistic sentiments about the grain situation. The supply system was not strictly controlled. Many farmers did not save enough grain, and waste was quite common. Some areas also saw illegal activities by private merchants and speculators who hoarded and bought grain on the black market for speculative transport. For example, in some non-disaster areas, some farmers were not satisfied with just eating their fill and demanded to eat better. After the wheat harvest last year, there was a phenomenon of eating and drinking excessively in some areas. In some areas, farmers blindly developed sideline industries that used grain as raw materials, regardless of the possibility of grain production. When food rations were used for sideline production, they then asked the state for grain. Most seriously, some farmers sold their grain on the black market at high prices and then turned around to ask the state to supply grain under the pretext of grain shortage. The Ministry of Food believes that all these practices are wrong. Therefore, it requires all localities to appropriately control rural grain sales, restrict grain consumption, and strictly manage sideline industries in rural areas that use grain as raw materials, while ensuring basic needs. All black market activities involving speculative grain transport must be banned. Farmers are required to consume grain in a planned way, live frugally, and promote the atmosphere of "saving grain and being thrifty," especially to continue strengthening education for farmers on "eating their own grain first and then the state's grain," and "supplying grain whenever there is a shortage," so as to achieve the requirements of the state "not supplying if not needed" to farmers, and farmers "not asking if not needed" from the state.

### 节约用粮　勤俭持家  农村粮食销量应适当控制  国家对农民“不缺不供”，农民向国家“不缺不要”

    节约用粮　勤俭持家
    农村粮食销量应适当控制
    国家对农民“不缺不供”，农民向国家“不缺不要”
    新华社14日讯 全国农村粮食销量应该继续适当地加以控制，以节约粮食消费。这是粮食部有关农村购销方面的负责人对记者说的。他说，过去一年农村粮食供应工作有了进一步改进，但也多销了一些粮食。
    过去这一年度（1956到1957年粮食年度），国家基本上摸清了农村的粮食余缺情况。对缺粮社、户和其它非农业人口都做了及时的供应，基本上满足了这些人对粮食的需要。同时，还保证了对灾区农民的粮食供应。这一年度，国家在农村共销了四百零一亿斤粮食。比上一年度在农村多销了六十九亿斤。据粮食部分析，多销的这六十九亿斤粮食，绝大部分是合理的多销。因为去年全国灾情严重，灾区粮食供应任务很大，去年仅向受灾的河南、河北、江苏、安徽、浙江、湖南、广西、吉林等八个省多销的粮食就有五十九亿斤（包括救灾种籽粮在内），占粮食多销总量的85％多，有力地支持了灾区农民的生产度荒。但是销售的粮食中，也有一部分是不合理的，据粮食部的估算，不合理的多销的粮食约有十五到二十亿斤，这部分粮食，如果工作做得好，是可以节约下来的。
    灾区的销粮有不合理现象。灾区的口粮供应偏宽了些，去年灾区每人每天平均一斤粮食，比上一年度灾区的口粮供应偏宽了些，去年灾区每人每天平均一斤粮食，比上一年度灾区每人每天平均供应量多了二两到四两。在非灾区的销粮中也有不合理现象。特别是去年下半年，不少农村干部和粮食工作干部对粮食局势滋长了盲目乐观情绪，对供应制度掌握不严，许多农民对粮食节约不够，浪费现象相当普遍，也有些地区出现了私商、私贩在黑市套购、抢购粮食进行投机贩运的不法行为。如在非灾区有些农民吃饱了肚子还不满足，还要求吃得更好，去年麦收后，有些地区出现了大吃大喝现象；有些地区出现了农民不顾粮食生产的可能，盲目的发展以粮食为原料的副业，当口粮被用于副业生产后，再伸手向国家要粮的情况；最严重的是，有的农民以高价在黑市上卖出自己的粮食，回过头来又以缺粮名义要国家供应粮食。粮食部认为，所有这些做法都是不对的。因此要求各地今后应当在保证基本需要的原则下，适当地控制农村的粮食销量，节制粮食的消费，并严格管理在农村以粮食为原料的副业，取缔一切投机贩运粮食的黑市活动。要求农民有计划消费粮食，勤俭过日子，提倡“节约用粮，勤俭持家”的风气，特别是要继续加强对农民“先吃自己的粮食后吃国家的粮食”，“什么时候缺粮什么时候供应”的教育，以做到国家对农民“不缺不供”，农民向国家“不缺不要”的要求。
