　　All Within the Four Seas Are Brothers
　　Chinese Youth Busy Meeting Friends

　　Most Loyal Friends
　　During the festival, youth representatives from various countries have dozens of meetings every day, taking the opportunity to talk and enhance understanding and friendship. These days, the Chinese youth delegation meets with youth from four or five countries every day.

　　In the magnificent cultural palace of the Likhachev Automobile Factory, Chinese youth representatives have already held three meetings with Soviet youth in four days: on July 29, they met with the youth of the Proletarian District of Moscow; on July 31, they had a get-together with the youth of the Likhachev Automobile Factory; and on August 1, they met with comrades from the Soviet youth delegation.

　　No matter how many meetings or how much conversation there is, the brotherly feelings between the Chinese and Soviet peoples and youth cannot be exhausted. "The friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples is the friendship of 800 million warriors, the friendship of people who share the same ideas and goals. This is the happiness of the Soviet people and the happiness of the Chinese people," said Comrade Shelepin, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Soviet Komsomol, at the meeting between the youth representatives of the two countries. Chinese youth regard Soviet youth as their best example. Hu Yaobang, head of the Chinese youth delegation, once again assured the Soviet youth comrades on behalf of the Chinese youth that Chinese youth will always be the most loyal and reliable friends of Soviet youth.

　　The friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples is inexhaustible. Soviet youth representative Ubamov from the wilderness of the Altai Territory brought greetings from the youth of Altai to the Chinese youth. The youth representative from the Likhachev Automobile Factory once again talked about the long-standing friendship between this factory and the China Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Factory. The conversation between the Soviet youth representative from Chita and the Chinese comrades was even closer. Razhibova, First Secretary of the Tajik Komsomol Central Committee, presented the Chinese youth delegation with a hanging screen with a portrait of Lenin and dressed Comrade Hu Yaobang in Tajik national costume. Chinese youth representatives pinned peace dove badges on the chests of Soviet girls. Moscow youth gave Chinese youth brothers carpets and accordions made by themselves. Chinese youth gave Soviet youth friends special handicrafts. Chinese young musicians played Tchaikovsky's "Swan Lake Waltz" with Chinese musical instruments. Soviet comedians performed skits in Chinese. On this day, the get-together between the Chinese and Soviet youth revealed their inexhaustible friendship everywhere.

　　Friendship Deepened in Times of Trouble
　　On the morning of July 31, Chinese and Hungarian youth representatives met cordially in a shaded cafe in the All-Union Agricultural Exhibition. This was no ordinary meeting, but the first gathering of youth from the two countries after the Hungarian October events.

　　Recalling the sincere friendship between the people of the two countries in those dark days, and looking at the joyous gathering in front of them, how could the hearts of the young people not be excited! Aiki Volva couldn't help but shout "Long live China!" in Chinese. When Hu Yaobang, head of the Chinese youth delegation, presented Volva with a headscarf printed with "Peace" and "Friendship," tears suddenly welled up in the Hungarian girl's eyes. She said, "How can I not be excited! I love the Chinese people. During the October events, we were visiting China. At that time, we were so anxious and worried about our motherland. The Chinese comrades understood us, they supported us and helped us. This deep friendship of the Chinese comrades increased our confidence. Today's meeting reminded me of those unforgettable days."

　　Sharing weal and woe in the October events has made the friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian peoples and youth even closer. Hungarian youth delegation leader Kamaern said, "After the October events, Hungarian youth further realized the importance of internationalism. It is difficult for us to express in words our gratitude for the care, support and help given to us by the Soviet and Chinese peoples during the event." Comrade Hu Yaobang also said, "After the October events, Chinese youth loved the Hungarian youth who are fighting for the socialist cause even more."

　　Next to a table, several Chinese youths listened attentively to Bar Vinath, an eyewitness to the October events, introduce the situation. At another table, Liu Ying, a female tractor driver from the China State-owned Friendship Farm, exchanged contact addresses with Ala, a female worker from the Budapest Cheese Factory, and agreed to communicate with each other. The youth of China and Hungary talked about politics and art. They listened eagerly, sang, and danced gracefully. They used this short three-hour meeting to express their brotherly friendship with each other.

　　Beijing Sends Greetings to Cairo
　　Chinese youth have a deep friendship for the heroic Egyptian youth, and their desire to meet with Egyptian youth at the festival has finally been realized. On the morning of the 31st, Chinese youth from Beijing invited Egyptian youth from Cairo and Port Said to meet at the "Golden Wheat Ear" restaurant in the All-Union Agricultural Exhibition.

　　Everyone gathered around the table in the spacious restaurant and talked. The Chinese youth kindly asked if the Egyptian cities destroyed by the war had been repaired. The Egyptian youth also asked the Chinese youth some interesting questions. Mahmet Sultan asked what Beijing looked like? How is the Great Wall now? He said he would like to go to China. More than 100 youths from China and Egypt talked to each other in Russian or English, and some used gestures. Sincere friendship broke down the barriers of language. Xiang Nan, deputy head of the Chinese youth delegation, said, "The friendship between the Chinese and Egyptian youth is not an ordinary friendship, but the friendship of brothers in battle."

　　During the meeting, the youth of China and Egypt performed wonderful programs. Chinese young actors performed a "Cowherd Flute Dance," which was praised by the guests. An Egyptian actress performed a poetic dance: on the banks of the Nile, after dusk, several women with veils and clay pots on their heads went to the river to fetch water. By the bonfire, people were dancing, and the women fetching water also joined in and danced with them. This program also won enthusiastic applause from the hosts. At the end of the meeting, everyone held hands and danced a waltz. They cheered "Peace," "Friendship," and "Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Egyptian peoples!" in Chinese and Arabic.

　　Happy Meeting Between Chinese and American Youth
　　The U.S. government has tried every means to prevent its people and its youth from knowing the truth about life in socialist countries. It is only afraid of them contacting people in socialist countries. Therefore, it has adopted a new "closed-door policy"—restricting or even prohibiting exchanges. However, the American youth delegation, most of whom are college students, still broke through various obstacles at home to come to Moscow to participate in the festival. Among them, a group invited the Chinese youth delegation to a get-together at the Water Restaurant of the All-Union Agricultural Exhibition on the morning of the 31st. This was the first meeting between Chinese and American youth. Wu Xueqian, deputy head of the Chinese youth delegation, told these American youths during the meeting that the Chinese youth delegation would also invite them to be guests.

　　At this meeting, Chinese and American youth warmly entertained their newly acquainted friends with their own songs, dances, and music, and sat in groups of three or five to chat. They were very interested in China. The American people have a good impression of the Chinese people, said one American youth in his speech. Obviously, under the long-term blockade and deception of the U.S. government, American youth do not know much about China. Their views on world political issues are also very "naive." So when they sat down to chat, they asked about everything: Chinese fashion, agricultural collectivization and industrial construction, freedom of religion, the liberation of Taiwan, and issues of peace and war. One American youth believed that American spies who committed crimes in China should not be arrested. A Chinese youth asked in return: If Chinese people committed crimes in the United States, what would their situation be? The American youth felt that he was at a loss for words.

　　An American female graduate student defended the U.S. government and monopoly capital, saying: Monopoly capital does not want war, it only wants to do business. If you don't believe it, please go to the United States to see. A Chinese youth asked: Will Mr. Dulles give us a visa to enter the United States? The lady still thought he would. So, a Chinese female college student pointed out to her: It is certain that Dulles will not give us a visa. Otherwise, why not issue exit visas to many Chinese students studying in the United States to return home?

　　These disputes reflected the differences in the understanding and ideological level of the youth of the two countries, but it did not affect the friendly atmosphere of the get-together at all. In the sun-drenched and peaceful air, both sides appreciated each other's programs together, continued endless chats for a long time, and exchanged souvenirs. When parting, many Chinese youth left their names to the American youth, while the vast majority of American youth did not dare to reveal their surnames, probably fearing being held accountable after returning home.

### 四海之内皆兄弟  我国青年会友忙

    四海之内皆兄弟
    我国青年会友忙
    最忠实的朋友
    在联欢节上，各国青年代表之间每天都有几十次的会见，他们借着这个机会交谈，以便增进了解和友谊。这些天中国青年代表团每天都同四、五个国家的青年会见。
    在利哈乔夫汽车工厂的华丽文化宫里，四天之内，中国青年代表们已经同苏联青年们举行了三次会见：7月29日同莫斯科无产阶级区的青年们会见，7月31日同利哈乔夫汽车工厂的青年们联欢，8月1日又同苏联青年代表团的同志们见了面。
    无论多少次的会见，无论多少次的倾谈，也谈不完中苏两国人民和青年的兄弟之情。“中苏两国人民的友谊，是八亿战士的友谊，是思想一致、目标一致的人民的友谊，这是苏联人民的幸福，也是中国人民的幸福。”苏联共青团中央委员会第一书记谢列平同志在两国青年代表们会见时讲的这番话热情而又深刻。中国青年把苏联青年看作是自己的最好的榜样。中国青年代表团团长胡耀邦代表中国青年再一次向苏联青年同志们保证：中国青年永远是苏联青年最忠实、最可靠的朋友。
    中苏人民的友情是谈不完的。来自阿尔泰边疆区荒地上的苏联青年代表乌包莫夫带来了阿尔泰青年们对中国青年的问候，利哈乔夫汽车工厂的青年代表又一次谈起了这个工厂和中国长春第一汽车制造厂的长久友谊，赤塔来的苏联青年代表同中国同志的交谈更加亲近，塔吉克共青团中央委员会第一书记拉吉勃娃赠给中国青年代表团一幅画着列宁像的挂屏，并且给胡耀邦同志穿上塔吉克的民族服装。中国青年代表在苏联姑娘们胸前别上了和平鸽的徽章，莫斯科的青年赠给中国青年兄弟们他们亲手做的地毯和手风琴，中国青年送给苏联青年朋友们特种工艺品。中国的青年乐手们用中国乐器演奏了柴可夫斯基的“小天鹅湖舞曲”。苏联滑稽演员用中国话演出杂剧节目。这一天中苏两国青年的联欢处处流露着他们之间的永远说不尽的友谊。
    患难之交友情深
    7月31日上午，在全苏工农业展览馆的一处绿荫掩映的咖啡馆里，中国和匈牙利两国青年代表们友好地会见了。这不是一次寻常的会见，是匈牙利十月事件后两国青年们第一次的相聚。
    回忆起那些黑云密布的日子里两国人民间真挚的友情，看着眼前欢乐的聚会，年轻人的心怎能不激动呢！爱琪·伏尔娃禁不住地用中国话高呼“中国万岁！”当中国青年代表团团长胡耀邦把一幅印着“和平”“友谊”的花头巾赠给伏尔娃的时候，这位匈牙利姑娘的眼泪突然夺眶而出。她说：“我怎能不激动呢！我爱中国人。十月事件的时候，我们正在中国访问。当时我们多么为祖国焦急而担心啊。中国同志懂得我们，他们支持我们，帮助我们。中国同志们的这种深厚的友情，增加了我们的信心。今天的会见，使我想起了那些不能忘怀的日子。”
    在十月事件中同患难，使中匈两国人民和青年的友谊更加亲密了。匈牙利青年代表团团长卡玛恩说：“十月事件后，匈牙利青年更进一步认识到国际主义的重要意义了。我们很难用语言来表达对于苏联和中国人民在事件过程中给予我们的关怀、支持和帮助的感激。”胡耀邦同志也说：“十月事件后，中国青年对为社会主义事业奋斗的匈牙利青年更加热爱了。”
    在一张桌子旁边，几个中国青年凝神听着十月事件目击者巴尔·维纳丝介绍这次事件的经过情况。在另一张桌子旁边，中国国营友谊农场的女拖拉机手刘瑛同布达佩斯奶酪厂女工阿拉交换着通讯地址，相约彼此一定相互通信。中匈两国的青年们谈政治，也谈艺术。他们热烈的倾听，歌唱，翩翩起舞。他们利用了这短短三小时的会见来表达彼此兄弟般的友情。
    北京向开罗问候
    中国青年对于英勇的埃及青年怀着深厚的友情，他们想同埃及青年在联欢节上会见的愿望终于实现了。31日上午，在全苏工农业展览馆的“金色麦穗”餐厅里，来自北京的中国青年邀请来自开罗、塞得港的埃及青年见了面。
    大家在宽阔的餐厅里围桌而谈，中国青年们关怀地询问埃及被战争破坏的城市有没有修复，埃及青年们也问中国青年一些有趣的问题。玛赫梅特·苏坦问北京城是什么样子？万里长城现在怎样？他说他很想到中国去一趟。中埃两国的一百多个青年彼此用俄语或英语交谈，也有的用手势交谈，真挚的友情打破了语言的隔阂。中国青年代表团副团长项南说：“中埃两国青年的友谊不是普通的友谊，而是战斗中的兄弟的友谊。”
    在会见中，中埃两国的青年都表演了精彩的节目。中国青年演员表演了一个“牧童短笛舞”，受到了客人们的赞扬。埃及的女演员表演了一个诗意的舞蹈：尼罗河边，黄昏之后，几个带着面纱、头顶瓦瓶的妇女到河边汲水，在篝火旁边，人们正在跳舞，汲水的妇女们也参加进去，同他们一起跳舞。这个节目也博得了主人们热烈的掌声。会见结束时，大家又手牵手地跳了一个圆舞。他们用中国话和阿拉伯话欢呼着“和平”、“友谊”、“中埃两国人民友好万岁！”
    中美青年相见欢
    美国政府千方百计拦阻本国人民和本国青年知道社会主义国家生活的真相，它只怕他们和社会主义国家的人们接触，因此它采取了新的“闭关主义”政策——限制甚至禁止来往。但美国青年代表团，最多的是大学生，还是打破国内的种种阻挠来到莫斯科参加联欢节。其中有一批人在31日上午邀请了中国青年代表团在全苏农业展览馆的水上餐厅联欢。这是中美青年的第一次会见。中国青年代表团副团长吴学谦在会见时告诉这些美国青年说：中国青年代表团也将请他们作客。
    在这次会见时，中美青年都热情地以自己的歌舞和音乐款待新认识的朋友，三五成群地围坐谈心。他们对中国兴趣很高。美国人民对中国人民有好感，这是一位美国青年讲话时说的。显然，在美国政府长期封锁和欺骗之下，美国青年对中国的事情很不了解。对世界政治问题的看法也是很“天真”的。所以当坐下来谈心的时候，他们什么都问：中国的时装，农业集体化和工业建设，信教自由以及解放台湾，和平与战争问题。一位美国青年认为在中国犯法的美国间谍不应该加以逮捕。一位中国青年反问：如果中国人在美国犯法，其处境会如何？这位美国青年觉得自己理短了。
    一位美国女研究生为美国政府和垄断资本辩护说：垄断资本不想战争，只想做生意，你若不信，请到美国看看。一位中国青年问：杜勒斯先生给不给我们入美国境的签证呢？这位女士还认为会给。于是，一位中国女大学生给她点穿说：杜勒斯不给我们签证，这是肯定的。要不，为什么不发给许多在美国留学的中国留学生回国的出境签证呢？
    这些争论反映了两国青年的认识的差异和思想的水平，但它完全没有影响联欢的友好气氛。在阳光普照的宁静空气里，双方一起欣赏彼此的节目，长久地继续毫无边际的漫谈，互相赠送纪念品。临别的时候，许多中国青年留下姓名给美国青年，而绝大多数美国青年不敢透露自己的姓，大概怕回国后被追究吧。本报记者  李何  程光锐（附图片）
