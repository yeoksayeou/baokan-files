    Pay Attention to Educating Individual Farmers
    Minqing Farmers Who "Drag Their Feet" Every Year Complete Tasks in This Year's Summer Grain Unified Purchase

    Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 14th: In the summer grain unified purchase, Tangxi, Wushang, Bandong and other townships in Minqing County, Fujian Province, paid attention to strengthening education for individual farmers, enabling individual farmers who had been lagging behind in previous years to complete their unified purchase tasks.
    After the cooperativization of Tangxi and other townships, agricultural cooperatives always delivered grain quickly, while individual farmers lagged behind during each unified purchase. The townships failed to tightly grasp individual farmers, leading them to develop the incorrect idea that they could benefit from "dragging their feet." This year, after arranging the grain delivery tasks for the agricultural cooperatives in the aforementioned townships, the focus was on mobilizing individual farmers to sell grain, striving for simultaneous completion of tasks by both agricultural cooperatives and individual farmers. In Wushang Township, after 43 individual households with surplus grain were educated on the policy of unified purchase and unified sales, they all completed the unified purchase task of 18,714 jin within three days. For surplus grain individual households who were not actively selling grain, persuasion was also carried out. Old middle peasant Yang Jingyuan had always delayed his unified purchase in the past, and this year he was preparing to delay again. The peasant masses helped him calculate the detailed accounts, proving that he had a surplus of 283 jin of grain in addition to his rations and seeds. After persuasion, he himself felt that he couldn't justify it, and completed the grain sales task the next day.

    注意教育单干户
    闽清年年“拖尾巴”的农户  在今年夏粮统购中完成任务
    新华社福州14日电　福建省闽清县塘西、圩上、坂东等乡（镇），在夏粮统购中，注意加强对单干户的教育，使年年拖尾欠的单干户也完成了统购任务。
    塘西等乡合作化后，每年统购总是农业社快、单干户拖，对单干户老是抓不紧，于是单干户就产生一种“拖尾巴”可以占便宜的不正确思想。今年上述各乡在农业社交粮任务安排妥当后，就重点发动单干户卖粮，争取做到农业社和单干户同时完成任务。圩上乡四十三户有余粮的单干户，经过统购统销政策教育后，三天内就全部完成一万八千七百一十四斤的统购任务。对于不积极售粮的余粮单干户，还进行了劝导。老中农杨景元历年统购都拖欠，今年又准备再拖一下。农民群众就帮助他算细账，证明他除留口粮种子外，还有余粮二百八十三斤。经过劝导后，他自己也感到说不过去，第二天就全部完成售粮任务。
