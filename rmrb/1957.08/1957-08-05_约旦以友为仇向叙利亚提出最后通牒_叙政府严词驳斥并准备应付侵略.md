Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 4th – A Syrian government spokesman issued a statement on the 3rd, rejecting a recent ultimatum given to Syria by the Jordanian government.

The Jordanian ultimatum was presented in a verbal message from Jordanian Foreign Minister Rifai, conveyed through Syrian Chargé d'Affaires in Jordan, Ahmed Rahbi, on July 31st. Rahbi returned to Damascus with this message on August 1st, and the Syrian government subsequently held a series of emergency meetings to decide on its response.

The Syrian government statement quoted Rifai as saying: "If your (Syrian) propaganda campaign against us continues, we are capable of stopping you. We have already sacrificed people on the Israeli border, and we can sacrifice more people on your border. We will disregard Israel and deal with you." Rifai also set a deadline of August 4th for Syria to respond.

The statement pointed out that Rifai's expression of using military force to deal with Syria's threat "shows that he has decided to launch an act of aggression against Syria, regardless of the United Nations Charter." The statement said that Rifai's ultimatum is "an action unprecedented in the history of international relations."

The statement also pointed out that Rifai is "creating an atmosphere to undermine Arab unity against Israel, as a prelude to forcing the Arab world to sign a peace treaty with Israel."

The spokesman emphasized: "Due to the serious statement made by the Jordanian Foreign Minister, the Syrian government and people will heighten their vigilance and strengthen preparations to deal with all aggression plans of Zionism and imperialism. The brave Syrian army remains an indestructible fortress of Arab nationalism."

The spokesman also pointed out that the so-called campaign in Syrian newspapers is just an excuse to cover up secret plans against the Arab nationalism that Syria is practicing.

On the same evening, Prime Minister al-Assali said: Syria is prepared to deal with any eventuality and will lodge a complaint and protest with the Arab League against Jordan's actions.

Commenting on Jordanian Foreign Minister Rifai's ultimatum at a press conference, he said that Jordan's action was unprecedented in the history of diplomatic relations. It is hard to believe that an Arab country would take such an attitude towards its brother country.

Al-Assali said: Syria has always kept silent on Jordan's current policies, but there is a limit to tolerance.

### 约旦以友为仇向叙利亚提出最后通牒  叙政府严词驳斥并准备应付侵略

    约旦以友为仇向叙利亚提出最后通牒
    叙政府严词驳斥并准备应付侵略
    据新华社大马士革4日电　叙利亚政府发言人3日发表声明，拒绝约旦政府最近给叙利亚的一个最后通牒。
    约旦的最后通牒是约旦外交大臣里法伊通过叙利亚驻约旦代办艾哈迈德·拉赫比转达的7月31日的口信中提出的。拉赫比在8月1日带着这个口信回到了大马士革，叙利亚政府接着举行了一系列紧急会议来决定对它的答复。
    叙利亚政府声明引述里法伊的话说：“如果你们（叙利亚）的反对我们的宣传运动继续下去的话，我们是能够制止你们的。我们已经在以色列边境上牺牲了人，我们能够在你们边境上牺牲更多的人。我们将不管以色列而来对付你们。”里法伊并且限定在8月4日以前得到叙利亚的答复。
    声明指出，里法伊的表示要以军事力量来对付叙利亚的威胁“说明他已经决定要不顾联合国宪章而对叙利亚发动侵略行动”。声明说，里法伊的最后通牒是“国际关系史上从未有过的行动”。
    声明还指出，里法伊是在“为破坏阿拉伯反对以色列的一致态度创造气氛，作为迫使阿拉伯世界同以色列签订和约的前奏”。
    发言人强调说：“由于约旦外交大臣发表了这种严重的声明，叙利亚政府和人民将提高警惕和加强准备，以对付犹太复国主义和帝国主义的一切侵略计划。叙利亚勇敢的军队仍然是阿拉伯民族主义的牢不可破的堡垒。”
    发言人还指出：所谓叙利亚报纸上的运动只是一种借口，用来掩饰反对叙利亚在实行的阿拉伯民族主义的秘密计划。
    同一天晚上阿萨利总理说：叙利亚已经准备应付万一，并且将向阿拉伯联盟控告和抗议约旦的行动。
    他在记者招待会上评论约旦外交大臣里法伊的最后通牒说：约旦这一行动是外交关系史上从来不曾有过的。很难相信，一个阿拉伯国家竟会对它的兄弟国家采取这种态度。
    阿萨利说：叙利亚一直对约旦现行政策保持缄默，但是容忍是有个限度的。
