The Anti-Rightist Struggle Forms a Broad Front
Over a Thousand Rightists in Gansu Fall Into the People's Encirclement

    (Reported by our newspaper) The anti-Rightist struggle in Gansu Province has formed a broad front. More than 54,000 people in various organs, organizations, and schools have surrounded nearly 1,400 Rightists, large and small, and are carrying out continuous reasoning struggles through large and small meetings.

    From May 31st to June 25th, Rightists in the province launched a frenzied attack against the Party, attacking every department, every policy, and every task of the Party. A group of Rightist ambitious individuals such as Yang Ziheng, Chen Shiwei, Li Huafang, Ma Futing, Shui Zi, Jiang Yuntai, and Yang Heling, respectively demanded that the Party abandon its leadership over democratic parties, schools, judicial affairs, news, publishing, literature and art, education, science, medicine, and other work; they completely negated the correct policies of "Suppression of Counter-revolutionaries," collectivization, unified purchase and supply, industrial construction, ethnic unity, diplomacy, wages, and so on. Some Rightists within the Party also took the opportunity to echo and help the Rightists outside the Party attack the Party.

    The Rightists completely misjudged the situation! They originally believed that the masses were in their control and did not see how the masses were suppressing their anger and enduring for twenty-five days. As soon as the struggle against the Rightists began, the masses broke with them and first heavily surrounded more than 160 backbone Rightists, and then put other Rightists in the dock. During the struggle, not only were the criminal activities of the anti-Party groups of Chen Shiwei, Yang Ziheng, Jiang Yuntai, and others exposed, but also problems that had not been discovered in previous political movements were found, and clues to the activities of certain counter-revolutionary groups were also discovered. Those who had been deceived by the Rightists became sober, many middle-of-the-roaders actively participated in the struggle, the Rightist groups began to disintegrate, and the Rightists were completely isolated and becoming more and more odious.

    At present, the general situation of the anti-Rightist struggle in Gansu Province is: the fighting force has been fully formed, the struggle is developing in depth, the Rightists are basically isolated, and they are being defeated one by one. However, the Rightists are not reconciled to defeat, and many are still stubbornly resisting or expressing surrender without disarming. In order to ensure the complete victory of the anti-Rightist struggle and to turn the anti-Rightist struggle into the most profound socialist ideological education movement for the people of the province, the CPC Gansu Provincial Committee is preparing to organize joint struggles in all circles (such as news and publishing, culture and art, etc.) to eliminate the common anti-Party remarks and actions in various circles. At the same time, it is convening relevant meetings to discuss and formulate the steps and methods for launching the anti-Rightist struggle in factories and rural areas. The Provincial Committee also specifically instructed all units to combine the anti-Rightist struggle with improving the leadership's ideology and work style, take the initiative to solve the problems raised by the masses, and further promote the anti-Rightist struggle.

### 反右派斗争形成一条广阔的战线  甘肃千余右派分子陷入群众重围

    反右派斗争形成一条广阔的战线
    甘肃千余右派分子陷入群众重围
    本报讯　甘肃省反右派的斗争已经形成一条广阔的战线。各机关、团体、学校的五万四千余人，包围了近一千四百个大小右派分子，通过大会和小会连续进行说理斗争。
    5月31日到6月25日，全省右派分子向党发起了猖狂的进攻，攻击了党的每一个部门、每一项政策、每一项工作。如杨子恒、陈时伟、李化方、马馥庭、水梓、蒋云台、杨鹤龄等一群右派野心家，分别提出要求党放弃对民主党派、学校、司法、新闻、出版、文学艺术、教育、科学、医学等工作的领导；他们完全否定了“肃反”、合作化、统购统销、工业建设、民族团结、外交、工资等的正确政策。党内的一些右派分子也乘机呼应，帮助党外的右派向党进攻。
    右派分子完全把情况估计错了！他们原来认为群众被他们掌握了，看不到群众是怎样抑制愤怒，忍耐了二十五天的。反击右派的斗争一开始，群众就同右派分子撕破了情面，首先重重包围了一百六十余名右派骨干，继之把其他右派分子放在被告席上。斗争中不但揭发了陈时伟、杨子恒、蒋云台等反党集团的罪恶活动，而且发现了历次政治运动中没有发现的问题，还发现了某些反革命集团活动的线索。曾被右派蒙蔽的人清醒了，许多中间分子积极参加了斗争，右派集团内部已开始分化，右派分子完全孤立而且愈来愈臭。
    当前甘肃省反右派斗争总的形势是：斗争队伍全面形成，斗争正向深入发展，右派分子基本孤立，正被各个击破。但是，右派分子不甘心失败，不少的人还在顽抗，或表示投降而不缴械。中共甘肃省委为保证彻底取得反右派斗争的胜利，为把反右派斗争变成对全省人民一次最深刻的社会主义思想教育运动，正着手组织各界（如新闻出版、文化艺术等）的联合斗争，以清除各界中带有共同性的反党的言论和行动，同时，正召开有关会议讨论、制定在工厂、农村中展开反右派斗争的步骤和方法。省委还特别指示各单位要结合反右派斗争改进领导思想作风和工作作风，主动解决群众提出的问题，进一步推动反右派斗争。
