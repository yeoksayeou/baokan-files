Ministry of Textile Industry Counterattacks Rightists
Engineer Wu Houfu's Fallacies Go Bankrupt

(Our report) The anti-rightist struggle is being carried out comprehensively in the Ministry of Textile Industry. The Basic Construction Design Institute has held consecutive meetings to criticize the reactionary remarks of Wu Houfu, an engineer and bourgeois rightist in the institute. Wu Houfu maliciously slandered the Party's policy toward intellectuals, saying, "The Communist Party's policy toward intellectuals is mainly distrust and political discrimination." He also said, "Now they are being used as stepping stones, and once the Communist Party masters the technology, they will be kicked away." In addition, he also made many reactionary remarks such as "The suppression of counter-revolutionaries is a Quixotic tilting at windmills" and "The Communist Youth League acts as thugs and busybodies."

Many engineers and technicians in the institute used their personal experiences to prove that Wu Houfu's remarks were malicious attacks through and through. Engineer Fang Xiaolun said that, taking Wu Houfu himself as an example, before liberation he was a technician, after liberation he was promoted to section chief in the factory, and after being transferred to the ministry he was promoted to a sixth-grade engineer and led the business of the transportation group. The general repair machine factory designed by the transportation group is equivalent in scale to a medium-sized machine manufacturing factory and is equipped with a considerable number of machine tools. Wu Houfu was not completely proficient in this area, and the leadership allowed him to learn while doing and to consult many confidential domestic materials. How can these countless facts explain the Communist Party's distrust?

On another battlefield of the anti-rightist struggle in the Ministry of Textile Industry, the masses and members of democratic parties powerfully exposed and refuted Luo Xumu, a rightist in the Finance Department, a member of the China Democratic League, and a member of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. The rightist Luo Xumu consistently opposed the Communist Party and socialism. During the period of great blooming and contending, he stirred up trouble everywhere, repeatedly posted inflammatory big-character posters, and slandered the Communist Party for having "nepotism" and other ten major favors. As late as June 14, he wrote a letter to Zhang Bojun, supporting Zhang Bojun's anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds, believing that Zhang Bojun's anti-Party remarks were "faithful advice" that "hit the nail on the head" and expressed "very support," hoping that this anti-Party culprit could hear his "small voice." He also publicly slandered Shi Liang at a symposium of democratic parties, saying that she was attacking others to elevate herself. The ugly face of this rightist has been completely exposed, and the masses are resolutely besieging him. On the front line of the anti-rightist struggle.

    纺织工业部反击右派分子
    工程师吴厚福的谬论破产
    本报讯　纺织工业部反右派斗争正在全面开展。基本建设设计院连续召开会议，批判该院工程师、资产阶级右派分子吴厚福的反动言论。吴厚福曾恶毒地污蔑党对知识分子的政策，说：“共产党对知识分子的政策主要是不信任，政治歧视。”又说：“现在是被人当作垫脚石，一旦共产党掌握技术，就要被一脚踢开。”此外，他还发表了“肃反是唐·吉诃德式的无的放矢。”“青年团充当打手、包打听”等许多反动言论。
    该院许多工程技术人员以亲身的体会，证明吴厚福的发言是彻头彻尾的恶意攻击。方孝伦工程师说，以吴厚福本人来说，解放前是技术员，解放后提升为厂里的科长，调部后又提升为六级工程师，并领导机运组的业务。机运组设计的总修机厂，规模相当于一个中型的机器制造厂，装配着相当数量的工作母机，吴厚福在这方面并不完全内行，领导上让他边做边学，参阅国内好多机密资料。这些不胜枚举的事实，怎样解释共产党不信任呢？
    在纺织工业部另一个反击右派分子的战场上，群众和民主党派的成员，有力的揭发与驳斥了财务司的右派分子民盟盟员、农工民主党党员罗虚牧。右派分子罗虚牧一贯地反对共产党、反对社会主义，在大鸣大放时期，到处点火，屡次张贴煽动性的大字报，污蔑共产党有“裙带风”等十大照顾。直到6月14日，他还给章伯钧写信，支持章伯钧的反党、反社会主义的言行，认为章伯钧的反党言论是“忠言谠论”正“切中时弊”，表示“非常拥护”，希望这个反党的罪魁能够听到他的“小小的声音”。他并在民主党派的座谈会上，公开污蔑史良是打击别人，抬高自己。这个右派分子的丑恶面目已经原形毕露，群众正在坚决对他围攻。在反右派斗争战线上
