Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 10th. Chen Jingkai, the creator of the latest world record in the clean and jerk for the bantamweight class, told Xinhua reporters on the 9th at a meeting of famous athletes with the press that he hopes to create even better results in the future by improving his technique.

Chen Jingkai has broken the world record for the clean and jerk in the bantamweight class several times. Among them, the record of 133 kilograms created in Shanghai in June 1956, the record of 135.5 kilograms created in Shanghai in November 1956, and the record of 139.5 kilograms created in Moscow on August 6 have been officially recognized as world records.

Chen Jingkai told reporters that he himself did not have anything remarkable to say about establishing this new world record. The main thing was not to disappoint the hopes of the motherland and the people. Therefore, he tried every means to complete the task assigned to him. Since arriving in Moscow, the Soviet side has prepared very good living and training conditions for Chinese athletes. In each practice session, he received assistance from the youngest and most famous Soviet coach Dugalov, weightlifter Novikov, Puskalev and others. At the same time, he also extensively exchanged experiences with weightlifters from Hungary, Poland, Egypt and other countries, gaining a lot and improving his technique.

However, his total score in this competition was not ideal, especially in the snatch, which did not reach his own record of 95 kilograms. Speaking of the technique of Chinese weightlifters, he said that our techniques are still young, we have little experience in international competitions, and we are not calm and composed enough on the spot. These are the areas that need to be improved. He hopes to bring what he has learned back to China this time and apply it in daily training in order to improve techniques and results.

When asked "Does he think this new record can still be improved?" he said, I estimate it can still be improved, but it will take a considerable amount of time. Since the level of sports is improving every day, it is not surprising to break records.

In the past, when the bantamweight clean and jerk reached 125 kilograms, some people said it had reached its limit. Later, 130 kilograms appeared, then 133 kilograms, and finally 135.5 kilograms. Every time, people said it was impossible, but this time, 139.5 kilograms appeared. Further improvement is still possible in the future.

He believes that the Soviet athletes participating in this competition are very young, such as Minayev, who basically only emerged in recent years. This proves that the new Soviet forces are growing very fast. It is entirely possible to continue breaking world records in the future.

Talking about his impression of this Games, he said that he was very happy to be able to participate in this large-scale international Games, especially to be able to see the techniques of athletes from various countries and to be able to contact athletes from various countries through this opportunity. He believes that this is very helpful for world peace and friendship between peoples.

    在莫斯科畅谈参加举重比赛心得
    陈镜开希望创造更新的纪录
    据新华社莫斯科10日电　最轻量级挺举最新世界纪录创造者陈镜开9日在一次著名运动员同新闻界的会见中对新华社记者说，他希望今后在改进技术的基础上创造更高的成绩。
    陈镜开已经几度打破最轻量级挺举世界纪录，其中1956年6月在上海创造的一百三十三公斤的纪录、1956年11月在上海创造的一百三十五点五公斤的纪录、8月6日在莫斯科创造的一百三十九点五公斤的纪录已经被正式承认为世界纪录。
    陈镜开对记者说，他在建立这一项世界新纪录中，他本人并没有什么了不起的地方，主要是为了不辜负祖国和人民的希望。因此，他想尽了一切办法来完成交给他的任务。从到莫斯科后，苏联方面为中国运动员准备了很好的生活和锻炼条件。在每次练习中，他都受到苏联最年青有名的教练杜加洛夫、举重运动员诺维科夫、普斯卡留夫等人的帮助。同时，他也和匈牙利、波兰、埃及等国的举重运动员广泛地交流经验，收获不少，技术上有所提高。
    但是，这次比赛中他的总成绩还不够理想，尤其是抓举没有达到他自己保持的九十五公斤的成绩。在谈到中国举重运动员的技术时，他说，我们技术上都还年青，国际比赛经验少，临场还不够沉着镇定，这些方面都是需要改进的。他希望这次能够把学得的东西带回国去，并且在日常训练中加以运用，以便改进技术提高成绩。
    在问到“他认为这个新的纪录是否还能提高”时，他说，我估计还可能提高，不过需要相当时间。体育运动的水平既然天天在提高，打破纪录也就不足为奇了。
    过去当最轻量级挺举到一百二十五公斤时，就有人说到顶了。后来又出现了一百三十公斤，接着又出现了一百三十三公斤，最后又有一百三十五点五公斤。每次都有人说不行了，但是这次竟然出现了一百三十九点五公斤。今后提高还是可能的。
    他认为参加这次比赛的苏联运动员都很年青，例如米纳耶夫等基本上都是近年才起来的，这证明苏联新生力量成长很快。今后继续打破世界纪录完全有可能。
    他在谈到他对这次运动会的印象时说，他很高兴能参加这次规模盛大的国际运动会，特别是能够看到各国运动员的技术，并且能通过这个机会同各国运动员接触。他认为这对于世界和平和人民之间的友谊是非常有帮助的。
