Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, August 18th. At the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Wenzhou Prefectural Committee's enlarged meeting, which concluded on August 14th, the CCP Yuhuan County Committee was severely criticized for the serious localist errors and right-leaning thought it committed on the grain issue.

Last year, the standard grain retention for the agricultural population in Yuhuan County was 464 catties (of rice) on average. Later, because this was considered too low, it was increased by 14 catties with the approval of higher authorities. However, the Yuhuan County Committee still believed that the grain retention was too tight and that the farmers did not have enough to eat, so it decided on its own to increase the grain retention by another 16 catties per person, bringing the total increase to 30 catties including the approved amount.

After receiving the report from the Yuhuan County Committee regarding the relaxation of grain retention standards, the CCP Wenzhou Prefectural Committee immediately pointed out its error and firmly disagreed. However, the Yuhuan County Committee never corrected this. In the first half of this year, the Yuhuan County Committee one-sidedly believed that the disturbances by a small number of farmers were due to the grain issue. As a result, they issued a large number of grain coupons on five separate occasions, resulting in an excess of over one million catties of grain beyond the three-fixed (三定) unified sales target. In 1956, Yuhuan County should have handed over more than six million catties of grain to the state based on the three-fixed targets, after deducting purchases and sales. However, due to excessive retention, reduced purchases, and increased sales, not only was not a single catty handed over, but more than one million catties had to be transferred in from other areas. The average ration for the agricultural population in the county increased by more than 50 catties compared to the three-fixed figures. This year, the higher authorities assigned Yuhuan County a target of 8.9 million catties of early rice procurement. The County Committee believed that it would be difficult to complete this task and repeatedly requested a reduction. At the same time, they only distributed a figure of 8.05 million catties to the lower levels, and with further discounts at the district and township levels, it was even further away from the number that should be procured.

Because the CCP Yuhuan County Committee itself had serious right-leaning thought, it was unable to criticize and correct the localism of township and commune cadres and the individualism of peasants. Therefore, these erroneous ideas continued to develop. When early rice procurement began this year, grassroots cadres again demanded the relaxation of grain retention standards and the reduction of procurement tasks. Many peasants also complained that the grain retention was not enough, and even mistakenly believed that causing trouble would lead to more grain. The phenomenon of withholding production and concealing yields in rural areas was even more serious than last year.

The meeting sternly pointed out the serious errors of the CCP Yuhuan County Committee on the grain issue, sharply criticized the localist thought of only considering the interests of the county and disregarding the interests of the state, and emphasized adhering to the unified purchase and sale system and acting in accordance with the state's three-fixed standards.

The secretary and deputy secretary of the CCP Yuhuan County Committee examined their serious localist errors and right-leaning thought at the meeting. They also examined their disorganized and undisciplined behavior and expressed their determination to learn from the lessons, correct their errors, and resolutely complete the grain procurement tasks.

The other CCP county committee secretaries and deputy secretaries who attended the meeting also received a great education, earnestly examined and criticized their own localist thought and right-leaning sentiments on the grain issue, and unanimously expressed their determination to resolutely act in accordance with the three-fixed policy and ensure the completion of the procurement tasks.

Xinhua News Agency Dispatch. Xinhua News Agency reporter Song Jie reports: Jinan County, Shandong Province, which has consistently completed grain procurement tasks relatively well and quickly in the past, has performed very poorly in this year's summer grain procurement. As of August 15th, only 44.2% of the county's 17 million catty summer grain procurement target had been completed. Even more serious is that the county's summer grain procurement work is currently tending towards stagnation.

Is this abnormal phenomenon due to the county having insufficient grain and an excessive target, making it impossible to complete the task? According to the reporter's investigation, this is not the case. First, this year's harvest of 630,000 mu of wheat in Jinan County was generally good, and the procurement target was not large. Second, since the spring, a large number of cadres have gone to the countryside to strengthen the leadership of grassroots organizations. Third, the county's procurement work has accumulated some experience over time. These are all favorable conditions for completing the summer grain procurement task in a timely manner. The reason for the poor completion of the procurement task is mainly the meddling of some cadres' right-leaning conservative thought. They do not attach importance to mobilizing the masses politically and ideologically and conducting investigation and research, but one-sidedly echo the cries of some backward masses about grain shortages. Before the summer grain procurement in Jinan County, some cooperatives experienced incidents of members demanding grain and withdrawing from the cooperatives. Some responsible cadres of the CCP Jinan County Committee and the county grain department did not analyze this, believing that the above phenomenon was mainly due to the bumper harvest last year, when several million catties of grain were purchased excessively. Without careful investigation and research, they blindly reduced the county's average wheat yield from 93 catties per mu to 67.9 catties based on the agricultural cooperatives' self-reported yields. Is it true that the wheat yield is low and the farmers lack grain? According to a survey of 43 households claiming grain shortages in Xinshi and other townships in early July, 42 of them had grain reserves, with the largest reserves ranging from 2,800 catties to 3,500 catties per household. According to statistics from 68 cooperatives in Quti and other townships, the average ration per person before the autumn harvest (two months) was over 70 catties; however, these cooperatives also owed more than 410,000 catties of public grain.

There is also widespread localist thought among cadres in the county's grain department and township and commune cadres. When carrying out the summer procurement work, they one-sidedly proposed to first retain enough rations and seeds for the farmers, and then procure as much as possible. When only a portion of the summer grain procurement target had been completed, some township and commune cadres suggested that they had purchased too much, and as a result, they returned 413,000 catties of surplus grain that had already been purchased to the agricultural cooperatives.

In light of this situation, the CCP Jinan County Committee is currently holding a three-level cadre meeting of the county, townships, and communes to launch a major debate on the unified purchase and sale of grain and the current so-called grain shortage. Many township and commune cadres have criticized and examined their right-leaning conservative thought and localist thought of only considering themselves and disregarding the state during the debate, and have guaranteed to complete the grain procurement task resolutely and promptly.

### 右倾思想为害不浅  玉环县委犯了严重错误  济阳夏粮征购迟迟不前

    右倾思想为害不浅
    玉环县委犯了严重错误  济阳夏粮征购迟迟不前
    新华社杭州18日电　在8月14日结束的中共温州地委扩大会议上，中共玉环县委在粮食问题上所犯的严重的本位主义错误和右倾思想，受到严格的批评。
    玉环县去年农业人口三定留粮标准平均四百六十四（稻谷）斤，后因偏低，经上级批准增加了十四斤，但玉环县委还认为留粮太紧，农民不够吃，又擅自决定每人留粮再增加十六斤，连批准的共提高了三十斤。
    中共温州地委收到玉环县委关于放宽留粮标准的报告后，立即指出其错误，坚决不同意。但玉环县委一直没有纠正。今年上半年，玉环县委又片面地认为少数农民闹事，就是闹的粮食问题，因而先后五次发下大量粮票，结果超出三定统销指标一百多万斤粮食。玉环县1956年度按三定指标购销相抵外，本应向国家上缴粮食六百多万斤，由于多留，少购、多销的结果，不但一斤没有上缴，还由外地调入一百多万斤，全县农业人口平均口粮比三定数字增加五十斤以上。今年上级分配给玉环县早稻征购任务八百九十万斤，县委认为很难完成，多次要求核减，同时只把八百零五万斤的数字分往下去，再加区、乡层层打折扣，就离应该征购的数字更远。
    由于中共玉环县委本身存在着严重的右倾思想，对乡社干部的本位主义和农民的个人主义思想不能予以批判纠正。因此，这些错误思想不断发展，到今年开始早稻征购时，基层干部又要求放宽留粮标准，减少征购任务。许多农民也喊留粮不够，甚至错误地认为闹事就会有粮食。农村中压产瞒产现象比去年更严重。
    会议严肃地指出了中共玉环县委在粮食问题上的严重错误，尖锐地批判了只顾本县、不顾国家利益的本位主义思想，强调坚持统购统销制度，按照国家三定标准办事。
    中共玉环县委正副书记在会上检查了严重的本位主义错误和右倾思想，还检查了无组织无纪律的错误行为，并表示决心接受教训，纠正错误，坚决完成粮食征购任务。
    参加这次会议的其它中共县委正副书记，也受到很大教育，认真检查批判了自己在粮食问题上的本位主义思想和右倾情绪，一致表示要坚决按三定政策办事，保证完成征购任务。
    据新华社讯　新华社记者宋杰报道：历年来一贯完成粮食征购任务较好较快的山东省济阳县，今年的夏粮征购任务却完成得很差。到8月15日止，全县一千七百万斤夏粮征购任务只完成了44.2％。更加严重的是，目前这个县的夏粮征购工作趋于停滞状态。
    这种反常的现象，是不是因为这个县粮食少，任务大，而不可能完成任务呢？据记者在采访中了解，情况不是这样的。一、今年济阳县的六十三万亩小麦收成一般都比较好，征购任务也并不大；二、春季以来大批干部下乡，加强了基层组织的领导；三、这个县的征购工作历史已积累了一些经验。这些都是及时完成夏粮征购任务的有利条件。征购任务完成得差的原因，主要是某些干部的右倾保守思想作怪，他们不重视从政治上思想上发动群众和调查研究工作，而是片面的跟着一部分落后群众叫喊粮食紧张。济阳县在夏粮征购以前，部分社曾一度出现社员闹粮、退社的现象。中共济阳县委会和县粮食部门的某些负责干部不加分析，认为上述现象的出现主要是由于去年丰收，多购了几百万斤粮食。他们不认真调查研究，便盲目地根据农业社的自报产量，将全县平均每亩小麦九十三斤的产量降低为六十七斤九两。事实上是不是小麦产量低，农民缺粮呢？据7月上旬新市等乡对四十三户闹粮食紧张农户的调查，其中就有四十二户有存粮，最多的每户存粮二千八百斤到三千五百斤。另据曲堤等乡六十八个社的统计，秋收前（两个月）平均每人留口粮都在七十斤以上；但是这些社也欠交了四十一万多斤公粮。
    这个县粮食部门的干部和乡、社干部中也普遍存在着本位主义思想。他们在执行夏季征购工作时，片面地提出要先留足农民的口粮、种籽，然后能征购多少算多少。在夏粮征购任务仅完成一部分的时候，一些乡、社干部却提出购过了头了，结果把已经收购的四十一万三千斤余粮又退还给了农业社。 根据这种情况，目前中共济阳县委会正在开县、乡、社三级干部大会，展开关于粮食统购统销工作和当前所谓粮食紧张问题的大辩论。许多乡、社干部在辩论中批判和检查了右倾保守思想和只顾个人，不顾国家的本位主义思想，保证及时地坚决完成粮食征购任务。
