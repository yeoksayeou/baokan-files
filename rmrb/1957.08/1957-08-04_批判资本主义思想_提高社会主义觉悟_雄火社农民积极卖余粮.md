Criticize Capitalist Ideology, Enhance Socialist Consciousness
Xionghuo Cooperative Farmers Actively Sell Surplus Grain

This newspaper reports that after discussing the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain and criticizing capitalist ideas in grain work in Xionghuo Agricultural Cooperative, Hongzhao County, Shanxi Province, the political awareness of the broad masses of cooperative members has been greatly enhanced, and they are actively selling surplus grain to support national construction.

Wheat Bumper Harvest, Ideological Poor Harvest

Since the establishment of this cooperative in 1952, wheat production has increased year after year. This year, the 728 mu of irrigated wheat fields yielded an average of over 500 jin per mu, higher than in any previous year.

However, this year, during field yield assessments and the formulation of preliminary distribution plans, many cadres were unwilling to estimate the yield based on the facts. Even the branch secretary said that this year's wheat could only yield a maximum of 450 jin per mu. In short, many people wanted to conceal the yield, reduce the amount of public grain turned over, and sell less surplus grain. When the township held a comparison meeting, the Party branch secretary and deputy director of the cooperative who attended the meeting underreported the total output by 30,000 jin.

When distributing grain to cooperative members, some cadres used various methods to try to give cooperative members more wheat. Some would vigorously insert the dipper into the grain once or twice when measuring the wheat, so that each dipper could distribute 8 or 9 to 11 or 12 liang more. Others would use scales to weigh the wheat, moving the balance weight inwards after leveling the scale, distributing 4 liang more per weighing. The whole cooperative distributed 14,000 jin more wheat in this way.

Some people behaved poorly regarding the handover of public grain and the sale of surplus grain, only caring about themselves and forgetting the country. It is worth noting that since the unified purchase and sale of grain, grain speculation has not been completely eliminated, which is very tempting for cooperative members. The idea of hoarding grain has resurfaced among some wealthy households. When formulating the production increase plan this year, the publicity was one-sided, and little was said about supporting the country. Relaxing political and ideological education is also the reason why cooperative members are unwilling to sell more surplus grain. At the same time, the capitalist idea of wanting to engage in grain speculation and trade was criticized.

Is Unified Purchase and Sale Good or Bad? All Cooperative Members Discuss

In response to the above ideological situation, meetings of Party and League member activists and general meetings of all cooperative members were convened successively. At the meetings, exemplary cooperative members and cadres in cooperation, unified purchase and sale, and wheat harvesting were commended, and the political purpose of developing production was explained. It was emphasized that developing production is not only to improve one's own life, but also to actively support national construction. It was explained that without the assistance of the country, it would not be possible to further increase production. In distribution, the interests of the country and the individual interests of cooperative members must be taken into account. The tendency to only care about individual interests and not care about national interests is one-sided and wrong, and ultimately unfavorable to farmers.

The Country Supports Farmers, Farmers Support the Country

After the explanation, the following questions were discussed in production teams: After cooperation, has the actual life of cooperative members improved or declined? Is unified purchase and sale good or bad? What is the purpose of production? Is it right to only care about the individual and not care about the country? How to correctly combine the interests of the country, the collective, and the individual? In the discussion, everyone calculated several accounts: (1) In the past, 89 households in the whole village borrowed grain, and the interest rate at that time was one dou of autumn grain after eating one dou of wheat before the wheat harvest; three dou of autumn grain after eating one dou of wheat before the autumn harvest. Working hard for a year was not enough to repay the debt. What about now? Not only is there no household borrowing grain, but the standard of living is improving year after year. (2) Calculate whether the income of wealthy households has decreased? Old middle peasant Zhang Qingshun used to earn ten shi, leaving five or six shi of grain after deducting public grain and fertilizer investment. Last year, in addition to dividing 3,000 jin of grain, he also divided more than 100 yuan in cash. After calculating eleven households in this way, only two households reduced their exploitation income, while their labor income increased. (3) At the beginning of this spring, the wheat seedlings did not grow well, and the state loaned more than 40,000 jin of chemical fertilizer, applying 40 jin per mu, and the wheat grew so well. More than 20,000 yuan was borrowed to buy a water pump, and all the arable land of the cooperative can be turned into irrigated land next year. After calculating this way, everyone realized: If it weren't for the country's support, how could our cooperative increase production year after year like this?

When discussing the country's support for agricultural cooperatives, many people asked how the cooperative should support the country? Some people still thought that the sale of surplus grain should not exceed 40% of the increased production, and they still did not want to sell more. Therefore, the use of leaving so much grain was further discussed. Let it be eaten? Everyone ate 457 jin last year, which is enough to eat, and now about 60% of households have surplus grain. Let it be exchanged for vegetables and meat? From the current standard of living, it is too extravagant. Selling grain on the black market? It is illegal, and the old capitalist road cannot be taken. Finally, everyone said that this year we have a bumper harvest, we have enough to eat and use, other places have poor harvests, and the country has difficulties, so we should sell more to the country. Selling more surplus grain is a glorious patriotic action.

Hand Over Public Grain Early, Sell More Surplus Grain

After several days of repeated discussion, a general meeting of cooperative members was held and a resolution was made: (1) Hand over public grain early and hand over good grain; (2) Based on the cooperative's bumper harvest this year, dry and clean the grain, sell more surplus grain, and retain grain according to the state-stipulated grain retention standard.

Finally, the Party branch decided to strengthen ideological and political work. At present, with summarizing the unified purchase and sale of grain to solve the relationship between the individual and the country as the center, concentrate on conducting one month of propaganda and education for cooperative members.

    批判资本主义思想　提高社会主义觉悟
    雄火社农民积极卖余粮
    本报讯　山西省洪赵县雄火农业社经过对粮食统购统销政策的讨论和批判粮食工作上的资本主义思想，广大社员政治思想觉悟大大提高，积极出卖余粮，支援国家建设。麦子丰收思想歉收
    这个社自1952年建社以来，小麦连年获得增产。今年的七百二十八亩水地小麦，每亩平均产量达到五百斤以上，比以往任何一年产量都高。
    但今年在田间评产、制订预分方案时，不少干部不愿意据实估计产量，甚至支部书记也说，今年小麦每亩顶多只能收四百五十斤。一句话，许多人都想隐瞒产量，少交公粮，少卖余粮。当乡里召开评比会议的时候，前往参加会议的党支部书记、社副主任就把总产量少报了三万斤。
    在给社员分粮的时候，有些干部使用许多手法，尽量让社员多分麦子。有的在用斗量麦的时候，用力在斗里插一两下，这样每斗可多分八、九到十一、二两。有的用秤秤麦，称平了又把秤驮往里移，每秤多分四两。全社分麦就多分了一万四千斤。
    对于交公粮和卖余粮，有些人表现很不好。管理委员会召开会议，驻社干部提议除留足公粮以外，还要留下八万斤余粮，然后再给社员分。经再三研究，才决定留足公粮，但还是不同意留余粮。统购统销好不好全体社员来讨论
    有些社员对交公粮不积极，又不愿多卖余粮，是只顾自己，忘了国家。值得注意的是，统购统销以来，粮食投机并未完全消灭，这对社员引诱很厉害。一部分富裕户囤积粮食的思想抬头了。今年在制订增产计划的时候，片面地宣传，而对支援国家谈的却很少。放松了政治思想教育，这也是社员不肯多卖余粮的原因。同时，批判了那种想做粮食投机买卖的资本主义思想。
    针对上述思想情况，先后召集党、团员积极分子会议、全体社员大会。会上表扬了在合作化、统购统销和麦收交粮中的模范社员和干部，讲解了发展生产的政治目的。强调指出，发展生产不单是为了改善自己生活，还要积极地支援国家建设。说明没有国家的援助，不能进一步增产的道理。在分配中，必须兼顾国家利益和社员个人利益，那种只顾个人利益不顾国家利益的倾向，是片面的错误的，归根到底对农民也是不利的。国家支援农民农民支援国家
    经过讲解以后，以生产队为单位讨论下列问题：合作化以后社员的实际生活是提高了还是降低了？统购统销好不好？生产的目的是什么？只顾个人不顾国家对不对？怎样把国家、集体、个人三者利益正确地结合起来？在讨论中，大家算了几笔账：（1）过去全村有八十九户借粮食债的，当时的利息是麦前吃一斗秋粮，麦后还一斗麦；秋前吃一斗麦，秋后还三斗秋粮。劳苦一年不够还债。现在呢？不仅没有一户借粮的，而且是生活年年提高。（2）算一算富裕户是否减少收入？老中农张青顺过去收入十石，除公粮和肥料投资外，留五、六石粮食。去年除分了三千斤粮，还分了一百多元现款。这样算了十一户，只有两户减少了剥削收入，而劳动收入都有增加。（3）今年春季开始的时候，麦苗长得不好，国家贷了四万多斤化学肥料，每亩追了四十斤，小麦才长得这样好。贷了两万多元买了一架抽水机，明年全社全部耕地都能变成水地。这样一算，大家认识到：咱们社要不是国家支援，怎末也不能这样年年增产。
    在讨论到国家支援农业社的时候，许多人提出社对国家应该如何支援？有人还认为卖余粮不要超过增产部分的40％，还是不想多卖。于是进一步讨论了留下那么多的粮食的用途，让吃吧，每人去年吃到四百五十七斤，已足够吃了，现在还有60％左右户有余粮。让换菜、换肉吃吧，从现在的生活水平来说，未免太不节约。走黑市贩卖粮食吧，是违法的，资本主义老路走不得。最后，大家都说，今年咱这里丰收，咱们够吃够用，其它地方收成不好，国家有困难，那就应该多卖给国家。多卖余粮才是光荣的爱国行动。早交公粮多卖余粮
    经过几天的反复讨论，开了社员大会，作出决议：（1）早交公粮、交好粮；（2）根据社里今年丰收的情况，晒干扬净，多卖余粮，按照国家规定的留粮标准留粮。
    最后，党支部决定加强思想政治工作。当前以总结粮食统购统销解决个人与国家关系问题为中心，集中对社员进行一个月的宣传教育。
