Seize the Good Opportunity of Midsummer
Shandong Agricultural Cooperatives Store Fodder

(Our Newspaper Dispatch) Agricultural cooperatives in Jining, Jiaxiang, and other counties in Shandong Province are seizing the midsummer season to mobilize cooperative members to vigorously carry out grass-cutting activities and store livestock feed.

The Dazhong Agricultural Cooperative in Jiezhuang Township, Jining County, through pre-distribution during the wheat season, comprehensively calculated the amount of fodder and fuel grass needed by the entire cooperative throughout the year, as well as the grass yield from summer and autumn crops. It was calculated that there was still a shortage of more than 943,000 jin. The result of the discussion on this issue at the members' representative meeting was that, in addition to advocating that members collect firewood, cut grass, and graze small cattle, they also organized collective lake grass cutting according to local conditions, which is expected to cut 960,000 jin of green grass in two months. According to statistics at the end of June, the fourth, seventh, and other four production teams of the cooperative had already cut more than 23,000 jin of grass. Under the slogan of "Solve the grass shortage for next year this year," the agricultural cooperatives in Menghai District, Dingtao County, carried out green grass cutting campaigns. Some cooperatives also allocated a certain amount of labor (mostly women and children) to be specifically responsible for cutting green grass. As of July 8, the entire district had cut 800,000 jin of green grass. It is estimated that the entire district is short of 1.15 million jin of grass, which can be completely resolved by the beginning of August.

The Zhuyuan Production Team of the Wulaowa Agricultural Cooperative in Jiaxiang County, in order to encourage the enthusiasm of cooperative members to cut grass, implemented a system of contracting grass to households. It mobilized cooperative members to report, according to their specific circumstances, how much green grass they could contract to deliver to the team during the six months of June, July, August, September this year, and March and April next year. Reasonable regulations were also made for the remuneration of cooperative members for delivering grass, and the team would negotiate prices once a month according to the season. Therefore, the members were very enthusiastic about cutting grass.

    抓紧盛夏好时机
    山东农业社储备饲草
    本报讯　山东省济宁、嘉祥等县农业社，抓紧盛夏季节，发动社员大力开展割青草活动，储备牲口饲料。
    济宁县接庄乡大众农业社，通过麦季预分，对全社全年需要的饲草、烧草数量及夏秋两季农作物的出草情况，作了全面的计算，计算出实需尚缺九十四万三千余斤。这一问题在社员代表会议上讨论的结果，除提倡社员拾柴、割草、放牧小牛外，同时因地制宜地组织集体割湖草，预计两个月能割青草九十六万斤。据6月底的统计，该社第四、第七等四个生产队，已割草二万三千多斤。定陶县孟海区各农业社，在“明年缺草，今年解决”的口号下，各社开展了割青草运动。有的社还抽出一定的劳力（多是妇女儿童），专门负责割青草。截至7月8日，全区已割青草八十万斤。估计全区缺草一百一十五万斤，到8月初就可全部解决。
    嘉祥县五老洼农业社朱园生产队，为鼓励社员割草的积极性，实行了包草到户的办法。发动社员根据自己的具体情况，自报在今年六、七、八、九月和明年三、四月这六个月的时间内，能向队包交多少青草。对社员交草的报酬，亦作了合理规定，由社根据季节情况，每月议价一次。因此，社员的割草劲头很大。
