In the conspiracy of the Zhang-Luo alliance to seize leadership of higher education institutions, a fierce female general emerged from the drama world. This was Professor Sun Jiaxiu, Director of the Department of Dramatic Literature at the Central Academy of Drama and a member of the National Women's Committee of the China Democratic League (CDL).

Although this female general may not have been as famous as Pu Xixiu, her abilities were not weak. She used clever artistic techniques to launch insidious and vicious attacks against the Party.

Igniting the Flames, Conspiring to Seize Leadership of the Academy

Sun Jiaxiu had a set of guiding principles and methods for seizing leadership of the academy. As early as March of this year, she used the pretext of holding an academic discussion on the drama "Sharing Joys and Hardships" to invite Dai Ya and other right-wing elements of the CDL from the Beijing People's Art Theatre (who were directly under the command of Luo Longji) to hold a CDL symposium at the academy, in preparation for anti-communist and anti-socialist activities. After the rectification campaign began, she believed that "China will have major reforms, and a new situation may emerge in intellectual circles... The Party may relinquish leadership in the cultural and scientific fields..." and that the CDL had much to gain. Starting from this erroneous assessment of the situation, she colluded with Xu Bu, another right-wing element in the academy's CDL, selected those who had been investigated during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and those who harbored resentment towards the Party, and held six consecutive symposiums, engaging in blatant incitement. At the meetings, she slandered, saying: "Some Party members engaged in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries were afraid of not catching big ones... I feel that Party members want to make a big splash to show off their merits." Under her instigation, an instructor who had been a Kuomintang major chimed in, saying: "I think the suppression of counter-revolutionaries was basically unhealthy, based mainly on forced confessions and supplemented by induced confessions..." Another former Kuomintang major, Yu Huai, shamelessly said "... I was wronged, Great and Honorable Officials!" The meetings were filled with cries of "suffering." In the short period of time these several symposiums were held, the CDL group recruited several new members.

Using the excuse of opposing sectarianism, Sun Jiaxiu wantonly slandered and attacked the work of the academy and the Party-member leading cadres within the academy. She said: "Sectarianism in our academy is very serious, and we must dig out the roots of sectarianism." She cleverly echoed Chu Anping's reactionary remarks, saying "I don't completely agree with Chu Anping's 'Party-owned world,' but Party members do have this kind of thinking... The Party members in power protect each other." She believed that some Party-member leading cadres were old and should "retire for recuperation," and others did not understand the business and had "difficulties" in their work, so the academy should be handed over to professors who understood the business. She incited the masses to oppose the Party, saying: "In previous movements, the masses wore mental shackles and were bound." "The masses have been educated by the Party in recent years and their awareness has improved, while the Party members have degenerated and regressed." The implication was that Party members should get out.

She adopted the same method as the CDL right-wing element Feng Yidai, saying that she did not want to engage in great democracy, but actually wanted to launch a "great, great democracy." She said: "We don't want to engage in great democracy, but when we can't move things, democratic parties, all the masses, and students may sign petitions."

Under the incitement of Sun Jiaxiu and other right-wing elements, satirical cartoons and inflammatory big-character posters appeared in the academy. Yao Dengfo, who had been drawn into the CDL by Sun Jiaxiu during the rectification campaign, even demanded that the Katyusha News (the academy's big-character poster) hold a four-hour report meeting for him personally, at which he openly clamored: "Party members are obsequious slaves, privileged aristocrats," and "plainclothes police who monitor people"; "The academy is not run with Party membership dues, and we demand that the Communist Party withdraw from the academy."

A Murderous Anti-Party Declaration

In this situation, Sun Jiaxiu was blinded by victory, and she believed that the time had come to launch a general offensive against the Party. On June 6, she ran to the Missile News Agency (the academy's big-character poster) and eloquently dictated her article "Disillusioned and Still Hoping." This was a murderous anti-Party declaration. She completely dismissed the achievements of the Academy of Drama in cultivating a large number of talents under the leadership of the Party and with the help of Soviet experts for the past six or seven years, and shouted like a madwoman: "You are depriving and destroying people's ideals, suffocating people's ambition, blocking the vitality of young people, and deceiving students' beliefs"; "Take a look at this garden, everywhere are weeds, burdock, lizards, and poisonous insects, where they hang a sheep's head to sell dog meat, where the incompetent pretend to be authorities; where hypocrisy replaces sincerity, replaces Party spirit."

Even more insidious, in her capacity as a so-called "Shakespeare expert," she used a sonnet that Shakespeare wrote three hundred years ago depicting the dark ages to describe the Central Academy of Drama:

  Tired with all these, for restful death I cry,
  As, to behold desert a beggar born,
  And needy nothing trimm'd in jollity,
  And purest faith unhappily forsworn,
  And gilded honour shamefully misplaced,
  And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,
  And right perfection wrongfully disgraced,
  And strength by limping sway disabled,
  And art made tongue-tied by authority,
  And folly, doctor-like, controlling skill,
  And simple truth miscall'd simplicity,
  And captive good attending captain ill:
  Tired with all these, from these would I be gone,
  Save that, to die, I leave my love alone.
        (Note: One line was originally dropped)

Then, she said: "It is not that I want to destroy socialism and pull people back three hundred years, but that you are pulling us back!"

The spearhead of this declaration was also directed at the entire literary and art world. He insulted all the writers and leaders of literary and art work in New China. She said: "Many new literary and artistic works do not have the heroic spirit of the new era. I understand that this is not due to the constraints of rules and regulations and dogmatism, but because many of these so-called authors and leaders of artistic organizations themselves do not have heroic souls."

Finally, she could not restrain her murderous intent and said fiercely: "We are sounding the alarm to you," "We will not allow this to happen," "If things continue like this, we can no longer cooperate with you," and we must "attack them in groups." See how this differs from Ge Peiqi's tone of killing communists?

On June 8, the academy was abuzz with rumors that Sun Jiaxiu would give a very brilliant speech at the CDL, and many people were invited to attend in advance. On this day, she came to the academy in high spirits and wearing beautiful clothes, believing that it was time to issue a general attack order. Unexpectedly, before she could take the stage, the People's Daily editorial "Why Is This?" was published. When she saw that the wind was not right, the brilliant play was not performed. However, the content of the speech was still presented with cleverly modified wording.

Scholar or Politician?

Then, the anti-rightist struggle began in the academy, and Sun Jiaxiu hurriedly took the initiative to write an article criticizing Yao Dengfo, pretending to be a gentleman and saying: "Yao's report is anti-Party and anti-socialist." But she avoided talking about her own problems, as if she had forgotten that she was Yao's introducer to the CDL, and it was precisely under her encouragement that Yao dared to utter such arrogant remarks as "let the Party withdraw from the academy."

When the spearhead of the struggle was directed at her, in a six-hour self-criticism, she played all kinds of double-dealing tricks. She said that she "had academic ambitions," but "had always hated politics, as if she had grown up in a glass box." He said that "he had spontaneously participated in the crime of igniting the flames of the right-wing elements." She put a lot of labels on herself: "despicable and dirty," "hypocritical," "individualistic," "bourgeois ideology," and sometimes even shed tears of grief, but she remained silent about her relationship with the Zhang-Luo alliance.

On July 17, the Central Academy of Drama held a general assembly of all faculty and students. At the meeting, Professors Zhang Junchuan and Liao Kedu and others exposed her conspiracy to attack the Party by tampering with Shakespeare's lines. It turned out that this "Shakespeare expert" was not specialized in academics, but a thorough political careerist. One professor said: "I have worked with her for six or seven years, and she claims to be a Shakespeare expert, but she has never wanted to talk much about Shakespeare... She wants to talk about Shakespeare when commemorating Shakespeare, about Whitman when commemorating Whitman, about Shaw when commemorating Shaw... She is not a scholar in a glass box, but a scholar in the exchange."

    戏剧界的一个凶恶女将
    李孟岩　克莹　邓世还
    在章罗联盟夺取高等学校领导权的阴谋中，戏剧界跳出了一员凶猛的女将，这就是中央戏剧学院戏剧文学系主任、民盟全国妇委委员孙家琇教授。
    这员女将虽然名气没有浦熙修大，本领可也不弱，她利用艺术上的巧妙手法，向党进行了阴险毒辣的攻击。
    点火煽动，阴谋夺取学院领导权
    孙家琇在夺取学院领导权的阴谋中有一套纲领和办法。今年3月间，她就以举行话剧“同甘共苦”的学术讨论为名，邀集受罗隆基直接指挥的北京“人艺”民盟右派分子戴涯等在学院开了民盟座谈会，进行反共反社会主义活动的准备工作。整风开始以后，她认为“中国将有大改革，知识界可能出现个新局面……党可能让出文化及科学领域的领导……”民盟大有可为。从这种对于形势的错误估计出发，她就同院内民盟另一右派分子徐步共同策划，挑选了在肃反中受过审查的和对党怀有不满情绪的人，连续举行了六次座谈会，大肆煽动。会上她污蔑说：“某些党员搞肃反，唯恐搞不到大的，……我感觉党员是不是想搞出个大的表表功。”在她的挑拨下，一个当过国民党少校的教员就应声而起，说：“我认为肃反基本不健康，是逼供为主，诱供为辅……”另一个当过国民党少校的余怀也无耻地说“……冤枉我哉，青天大老爷！”会上是一片“诉苦”声。在开这几次座谈会的短时期中，民盟小组发展了好几个盟员。
    孙家琇借口反对宗派主义，对学院工作和院内的党员领导干部大肆污蔑攻击。她说：“我院宗派主义很严重，我们要把宗派主义的根挖出来。”她巧妙地响应储安平的反动言论，说“我不完全同意储安平说的党天下，但是党员是有这种思想的……掌权党员，互相包庇。”她认为党员领导干部，有的老了，应该“休养”，有的不懂业务，工作“困难”，要把学院交给懂业务的教授来办。她煽动群众同党对立，说：“以前运动中群众是带着精神枷锁的，被束缚的。”“群众这些年受党的教育，觉悟提高了，而党员呢，却蜕变了，退步了。”言下之意，是要党员滚蛋。
    她同民盟右派分子冯亦代采取同一手法，口说不想搞大民主，实际想发动一个“大大民主”。她说：“我们不想搞大民主，但搬不动时，可能民主党派，全体群众、学生签名要求。”
    在孙家琇等右派分子的煽动下，院内出现了张牙舞爪的讽刺画和煽动性的大字报。在整风中被孙家琇拉入民盟的尧登佛竟要求卡秋莎报（院内大字报）为他个人举办了个长达四小时的报告会，会上公然叫嚣道：“党员是唯唯诺诺的奴才，是特权的贵族”，是“监视人的便衣警察”；“学院不是党费办的，要求共产党退出学院”。
    一篇杀气腾腾的反党宣言
    在这种情况下，孙家琇被胜利冲昏了头脑，她认为向党发动总攻的时机到了。6月6日她跑到导弹报社（院内大字报）慷慨激昂地口述了她那篇“幻灭了的及还希望着的”文章。这是一篇杀气腾腾的反党宣言。她一笔抹煞了戏剧学院在党的领导下，在苏联专家帮助下，六七年来培养出大批人材的成绩，像发了疯地叫喊说：“你们在剥夺摧毁人的理想，窒息了人们的事业心，堵塞了青年人的朝气，欺骗了学生们的信仰”；“请看看这块园地，到处是莠草、牛蒡草、蜥蜴、毒虫，在这里挂羊头卖狗肉，在这里是不学无术冒充权威；在这里用虚伪代替真诚，代替党性。”
    更阴险的是她以所谓“莎士比亚专家”的身份，把莎士比亚在三百年前描绘当时黑暗时代的一首十四行诗，来描写中央戏剧学院：
  对这些都倦了，我哭求安息的死，
  譬如见到才能注定要做乞丐，
  空虚的无物倒打扮得漂漂亮亮了，
  最纯洁的信仰被不幸地破坏，
  灿烂的荣誉被可耻的放错了地位，
  处女般的贞洁遭到强奸，邪恶，
  不法地侮辱了正义的完善，
  艺术被权威捆住了口舌，
  愚蠢（俨如博士）控制着学术，
  单纯的真理被瞎唤作呆笨，
  被俘的“善”，侍候着“恶”将军，
  对这些都倦了，我要离开人间，
  只是，我死了，要使我爱人孤单。
             （注：原掉一行）
    然后，她说：“不是我要破坏社会主义，把人们拉回三百年前去，而是你们正在把我们拉回去！”
    这篇宣言的矛头，还指向了整个文艺界。他辱骂新中国的所有作家和文艺工作领导者。她说：“许多新文艺作品，里面都没有新时代的英雄气概，我明白了，这并不是由于清规戒律、教条主义的束缚，而是他们这许多所谓作者们，所谓艺术团体的领导者们，本身就没有英雄的灵魂。”
    最后，她竟至按捺不住自己的杀气，凶恶地说：“我们向你们敲起警钟”，“我们不允许这样做”，“照这样下去，我们不能再同你们合作了”，要“群起而诛之”了。试看这和葛佩琦的杀共产党人调子有什么区别呢？
    6月8日，学院到处喧嚷着孙家琇在民盟将有非常精采的发言，事先还邀请了很多人参加。这一天她兴高采烈，穿着漂亮的衣服来到学院，她以为该到下总攻击令的时候了。不料还没有登场，人民日报的社论“这是为什么”发表了。她一看风头不对，精采的戏就没有唱成。不过发言的内容还是以极巧妙的词句改头换面端出来了。
    学者乎，政客乎？
    接着学院反右派斗争开始，孙家琇连忙主动地写了篇批判尧登佛的文章，装作一副正人君子的样子说：“尧的报告是反党的，反社会主义的”。而对自己的问题则避而不谈，仿佛忘了她是尧的入盟介绍人，正是在她的鼓励下，尧才敢发出那样“让党退出学院”的狂妄言论。
    当斗争的矛头对准了她的时候，在一次整六小时的自我检讨中，她耍尽了两面派的花招。她说自己“学术上是有野心的”，“但一向讨厌政治，仿佛是在玻璃盒中长大的”。他说“自己是自发地参加了右派分子的点火罪行”。她给自己戴了一大堆帽子：“卑鄙污浊”，“虚伪”，“个人主义”，“资产阶级思想”，有时竟然伤心得流了泪，但是她同章罗联盟的关系如何，却闭口不言。
    7月17日中央戏剧学院举行了全院师生大会。会上张君川、廖可兑等教授揭穿了她如何用篡改莎士比亚诗句的手法进攻党的阴谋。原来这位“莎士比亚专家”，对于学术并不专长，倒是一个彻头彻尾的政治野心家。一位教授说：“我和她共事六七年，她自命为莎士比亚专家，却从来不愿多讲莎士比亚。……她是到纪念莎士比亚的时候想讲莎士比亚，纪念惠特曼的时候想讲惠特曼，纪念萧伯纳的时候想讲萧伯纳……她不是玻璃盒中的学者，而是交易所中的学者”。
