Xinhua News Agency, August 29th: An article on the state of culture and art in the United States, recently published in the American "Worker" weekly, stated that American opera is in a "dismal situation." Almost all major American cities lack opera houses and professional opera companies. There are only three permanent professional opera companies in the entire United States, while most European countries have dozens. Many talented American singers are forced to seek a living abroad.

American ballet companies are also barely surviving due to lack of funds and government support. Other independently operated radio stations, television, painting, sculpture, and other art departments are all ignored by the American government.

The weekly also reported that a wealthy country like the United States actually spends less on the arts each year than a small country like Sweden.

In the United States, where even monkeys and donkeys can become "great artists," genuine artists live an inhuman existence.

A university in New York recently conducted a six-month survey of the lives of American artists and discovered the following facts: Artists generally cannot make a living solely from their art. Some people cannot obtain any income from their creations and can only rely on various side jobs, or even their spouses' income, to survive.

　　金元帝国文化生活怪现象
　　猴子和毛驴吃香真正艺术家潦倒
    据新华社29日讯  美国“工人”周报不久前发表的一篇关于美国文化艺术情况的报道说，美国的歌剧正处在一种“惨淡的境地”。几乎美国所有的大城市都缺乏歌剧院和职业性歌剧团。全美国只有三个固定的职业性歌剧团，而一般欧洲国家都有几十个。许多有天才的美国歌唱家不得不到国外谋生。
    美国巴蕾舞剧团也是在缺乏资金、国家不予资助的情况下苟延残喘。其他独立经营的广播电台、电视、绘画、雕刻等艺遭到美国政府的忽术部门也一律视。
    这个周刊还报道：像美国这样一个富有的国家，每年在艺术事业方面的支出事实上比瑞典那么一个小国还要少。
    在连猴子和驴子都能够成为“大艺术家”的美国，真正的艺术家却过着非人的生活。
    纽约的一个大学最近对美国艺术家的生活进行了六个月的调查研究工作，发现了下面几点事实：一般进行创作的艺术家光靠艺术根本不能维持生活。有一部分人不能从创作中获得任何收入，只能靠各种副业、有的甚至靠爱人的收入来维持生活。
