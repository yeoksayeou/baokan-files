　　New Products

　　New Type Locomotive

　　The Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Factory recently designed and trial-produced a "Construction" type freight locomotive. After modifying the boiler, steam engine, and other parts, the tractive force of this new locomotive is 22% higher than that of the ㄇㄎ一 type locomotive commonly used on railways. The new locomotive is also equipped with automatic coal loading, automatic oil injection, and pneumatic grate rocking devices.

　　Handheld Movie Camera

　　The domestically produced handheld 35mm movie camera has recently begun production at the state-owned Nanjing Film Machinery Factory. This handheld movie camera has a small and lightweight structure, with a total weight of only 4.5 kilograms. This movie camera is most suitable for shooting news documentaries, science education films, and outdoor scenes for art films.

　　Leather Shoes Without Leather

　　Raincoat Without Rubber

　　A raincoat that does not require rubber and leather shoes that do not require leather have recently been successfully trial-produced in Tianjin.

　　Leather shoes made from polyvinyl chloride plastic, a synthetic leather trial-produced by a modern chemical plant, do not need oiling. If they get dirty, just wipe them with a damp cloth. These leather shoes are brighter than ordinary leather shoes, waterproof, and do not crack. They do not have the odor of leather.

　　Polyvinyl chloride plastic is hot-rolled into a translucent film, which becomes a good material for making raincoats. The Southeast Rainwear Clothing Factory used this material to trial-produce raincoats, which are very lightweight and fold up to the size of a book.

　　Automatic Turning Tower Crane

　　The first domestically-made 2-6 ton tower crane capable of automatic turning has been successfully trial-produced at the Shanghai Construction Machinery Manufacturing Factory, using all domestically-made materials. The maximum lifting weight of this crane is six tons, the maximum boom range is twenty meters, and the maximum lifting height is forty meters, making it suitable for use in metal structure workshops and during the assembly of eight- or nine-story buildings.

    新产品
    新型机车
    大连机车车辆制造工厂最近设计和试制成一种建设型货运机车。经过改造锅炉、汽机等部分后的这台新机车，比铁路上普遍行驶的冖ㄎ一型机车的牵引力提高22％。新机车上还有自动加煤、自动注油、风动摇炉等装置。
    手提电影摄影机
    国产手提三十五毫米电影摄影机最近在国营南京电影机械厂开始生产。这种手提电影摄影机构造小巧、轻便，全部重量只有四·五公斤。这种电影摄影机最适合拍摄新闻纪录片和科学教育片、艺术片的外景。
    不用皮革的皮鞋
    不用橡胶的雨衣
    不需要橡胶做的雨衣和不用皮革做的皮鞋，最近在天津试制成功。
    用近代化学厂试制成功的聚氯乙烯塑料——人造皮革做出来的皮鞋不用上油，穿脏了只要用湿布一擦就行，这种皮鞋比普通皮鞋亮，不透水也不裂。没有皮革的臭味。
    把聚氯乙烯塑料经过高温轧制成一种半透明的薄膜，就成为做雨衣的好材料。东南雨衣服装制造厂用这种材料试制了雨衣，非常轻便，折叠起来只有一本书那么大。
