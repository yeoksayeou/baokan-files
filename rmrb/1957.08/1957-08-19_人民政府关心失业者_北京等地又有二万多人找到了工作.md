People's Government Cares for the Unemployed
    Beijing and Other Places Have Found Jobs for Over 20,000 People
    (Reported by our newspaper) This first half of this year, under the leadership of local Party committees, labor departments in various regions have actively organized unemployed people to find their own ways to employment, based on the Central Committee's guiding principle of "overall consideration, appropriate arrangements, and strengthening ideological education." In the five cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Chongqing, and Xiamen alone, over 27,000 unemployed people have found a way to make a living.
    Since February of this year, the Beijing Municipal Labor Bureau has proposed assisting unemployed people in developing production for self-salvation. It has organized 654 unemployed people, families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, poor citizens, and family members of workers in six districts, including Qianmen, and the eastern suburban district, to establish 18 service groups of various types. The income of group members is relatively good. Repair groups earn an average of three yuan per person per day at most and one yuan and five jiao at least. Processing groups and service groups earn between three or four jiao and two yuan per person per day. Many group members have poor employment conditions and find it difficult to find other jobs. Now that they have employment opportunities, they are in high spirits and very grateful to the government. For example, Jin Yanbin from Xisi District earned more than 130 yuan in over 50 days after joining the electrician group. When his wife was ill, the group also subsidized him from the public welfare fund. He said with emotion, "I will repay the government's kindness." After organizing the unemployed to develop production for self-salvation, the government has also reduced its burden. Among the twelve people in the bicycle watching group in Xisi District, eight are over 50 years old, and four have serious illnesses. Originally, ten people received government relief, with a monthly subsidy of 85 yuan. Now, most of them no longer need government relief.
    In the first quarter of this year, the twelve districts of Shanghai adopted various methods to solve the livelihood problems of more than 4,300 unemployed people who were unemployed throughout their families and faced difficulties in life. Some organized unemployed people to recycle waste products for enterprises, some organized them to engage in household sideline occupations, and some engaged in sporadic loading, unloading, and transportation work at wharves, warehouses, construction sites, and enterprises. Dongchang District organized 314 people to pick coal slag, scrap iron, screen fluorite, knock fire bricks, and pick iron oxide at the Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant No. 3, and each person could earn 32 to 45 yuan per month.
    Some unemployed people in Wuhan have organized small labor teams to undertake sporadic loading, unloading, and transportation tasks that the transportation company cannot handle. During the peak season, each male worker can earn 70 yuan per month, and 20 yuan even during the off-season.
    As of April of this year, 1,700 unemployed people in Nanjing have participated in making straw paper, making straw ropes, and other work. The government also used the method of providing work as a form of relief to organize unemployed people to dredge Xuanwu Lake and Jinchuan River, solving the livelihood problems of one or two thousand strong laborers for eight or nine months. In addition, they are also preparing to organize more than 1,500 households to participate in agricultural production and organize more than 100 people to pull tricycles.
    The labor departments in various regions are also studying and resolving some specific issues in the work, such as the division of labor and cooperation between various production self-salvation organizations and handicraft industries and social welfare undertakings. (Yan Mianzhou)

    人民政府关心失业者
    北京等地又有二万多人找到了工作
    本报讯　今年上半年，各地劳动部门在各地党委领导下，根据中央“统筹兼顾，适当安排，加强思想教育”的指示精神，积极组织无业失业人员自谋就业门路。仅北京、上海、南京、重庆、厦门等五个城市就有两万七千多失业无业人员谋得了生活出路。
    北京市劳动局从今年2月提出协助失业无业人员开展生产自救以来，先后在前门等六个城区和东郊区，组织失业无业人员、烈军属、贫苦市民、职工家属六百五十四人，成立了十八个各种性质的服务组。组员收入较好，修理组平均每人每天最高三元，最低一元五角；加工组和服务组，每人每天收入三、四角到二元不等。很多组员就业条件差，另找工作困难，现在有了工作机会，情绪很高，很感激政府。如西四区的金彦斌参加电工组后，五十多天收入一百三十多元；爱人有病，组里还从公益金中补助了他一些。他感动地说：“我要好好报答政府的恩情。”组织无业失业人员生产自救以后，政府也减轻了负担。西四区看自行车组的十二个人当中，五十岁以上的有八人，四人有严重疾病，原有十人受政府救济，每月补助八十五元，现在大部分已经不需要政府救济了。
    今年第一季度，上海市十二个区采取各种办法，解决了全家失业、生活困难的四千三百多名失业人员的生活出路问题。有的组织失业人员为企业回收废品，有的组织他们从事家庭副业，从事码头、仓库、工地、企业的零星装卸、搬运工作。东昌区组织了三百一十四人到上海钢铁三厂拣煤渣、拣废铁、筛莹火石、敲耐火砖、拣氧化铁，每人每月能收入三十二元到四十五元。
    武汉市有的失业人员，组织了小型劳动队，承担搬运公司不能做的零星装卸运输任务。旺季时期，每个男工每月收入七十元，淡季也可收入二十元。
    到今年4月份止，南京市已经有一千七百名失业人员分别参加了造草纸、打草绳等工作。政府还用以工代赈的方式，组织无业失业人员疏浚玄武湖、金川河，解决了一两千名壮工八、九个月的生活问题。此外，他们还准备组织一千五百多户参加农业生产，组织一百多人拉三轮车。
    工作中的一些具体问题，如各种生产自救组织同手工业、社会福利事业的分工和配合等等，各地劳动部门也正在研究解决中。（鄢冕周）
