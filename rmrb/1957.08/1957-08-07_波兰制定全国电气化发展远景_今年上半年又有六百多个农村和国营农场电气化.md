Warsaw, August 6th (By our correspondent) – It is estimated that by 1975, Poland's power generation will reach 120 billion kilowatt-hours, six times the current power generation, or 33 times the pre-war 1937 power generation. Currently, Poland's national power generation is 20 billion kilowatt-hours, while in 1937 it was only 3.6 billion kilowatt-hours. This prospective figure was announced by Professor Lech Jakubowski, Chairman of the Polish National Electrification Committee, affiliated with the Polish Academy of Sciences, at a press conference.

The Polish National Electrification Committee was established last year, and its task is to plan Poland's power development. It is currently formulating a prospective plan for Poland's power development in the next twenty years. The committee has about eighty members, all experts from various sectors of the national economy. The prospective figure for power development by 1975 is based on Poland's needs and possibilities. This includes future industrial development and population growth.

The committee pointed out that in the twenty years up to 1975, coal-fired power generation will account for only 80% of the total power generation, with the remainder being hydroelectric power (10%), power generation using oil and gas as fuel, and nuclear power generation. By then, the coal saved will greatly increase Poland's coal exports, because before the widespread application of nuclear energy in the industrial and agricultural production of various countries, the whole of Europe is short of coal.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, August 6th – During the first half of this year, a total of 529 rural areas, 124 state-owned farms and 54 cooperative economic centers throughout Poland were electrified.

Interestingly, the number of electrified rural areas in just this half year is equivalent to half the number of all electrified rural areas in pre-war Poland. In 1938, there were only 1,263 electrified rural areas in the whole of Poland.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, August 6th – For more than half a year, Poland's rural credit cooperatives have developed into the largest economic organization for farmers in Poland, with more than one million members, accounting for about one-third of the total number of farm households in the country.

These credit cooperatives have offices in more than 3,000 small towns across Poland.

In the past half year, these credit cooperatives have issued more than 55 million zlotys in loans to farmers using their own deposits; in addition, they have handled 1.45 billion zlotys in short-term agricultural and handicraft loans and advance payments for agricultural products issued by the state, which is 80 million zlotys more than the loans and advance payments handled in the whole of last year.

Polish farmers have a tradition of running credit cooperatives before the war, but the credit cooperatives at that time were capitalist in nature. Before October last year, rural credit cooperatives had very little business, because at that time the credit cooperatives did not absorb farmers' deposits, but only handled state agricultural loans and advance payments. Because farmers had no place to store their surplus money, they had to temporarily buy goods to preserve it. Since October last year, credit cooperatives have become active again, and they have the right to absorb farmers' deposits and issue loans to farmers. The managers of the cooperative are elected by the members, realizing democratic management, but are financially controlled and supervised by the National Bank.

### 波兰制定全国电气化发展远景  今年上半年又有六百多个农村和国营农场电气化

    波兰制定全国电气化发展远景
    今年上半年又有六百多个农村和国营农场电气化
    本报华沙6日电　预计到1975年，波兰的发电量将达到一千二百亿瓩时，为目前发电量的六倍。也就是为战前1937年发电量的三十三倍。目前波兰全国的发电量为二百亿瓩时，1937年仅为三十六亿瓩时。这个远景数字是波兰科学院所属波兰全国电气化委员会主席莱赫—雅库博夫斯基教授在一次记者招待会上宣布的。
    波兰全国电气化委员会是去年成立的，它的任务是就波兰电力发展作出规划。它目前正在制订未来二十年内波兰电力发展的远景计划。这个委员会约有八十个成员，都是来自国民经济各个部门的专家。到1975年，电力发展的远景数字是根据波兰的需要和可能作出的。这里包括未来工业的发展和人口的增长。
    这个委员会指出：到1975年二十年内，用煤作燃料的火力发电将只占全部发电量的80％，其余将为水力发电（10％）、用石油和煤气作燃料的发电以及原子能发电。到那时，节省下来的煤，将大大增加波兰出口煤的数量，因为在原子能普遍应用在各国工农业生产之前，整个欧洲是缺煤的。
    本报华沙6日电　今年上半年期间全波兰一共有五百二十九个农村、一百二十四个国营农场和五十四个合作经济中心实行电气化。
    有意思的是，仅这半年内实行电气化农村的数字，就相当于战前旧波兰所有电气化农村数字的一半。在1938年，全波兰只有一千二百六十三个电气化农村。
    新华社华沙6日电　半年多以来，波兰农村的信贷合作社已经发展成为全波兰农民的最大的经济组织，拥有一百多万户社员，约占全国农户总数的三分之一。
    这些信贷合作社在波兰全国三千多个小城镇上设有办事处。
    在最近半年里，这些信贷合作社以自己拥有的存款向农民发放了五千五百多万兹罗提的贷款；另外还经办了国家发放的短期农业、手工业贷款和农产品预购款共十四亿五千多万兹罗提，比去年全年所经办的贷款和预购款多出八千万兹罗提。
    波兰农民在战前就有办信贷合作社的传统，但是那时的信贷合作社带有资本主义性质。在去年10月以前，农村的信贷合作社业务很少，因为那时信贷合作社不吸收农民的存款，只经办国家的农贷和预购款。农民由于没有地方储存余钱，只好暂时买成实物来保存。从去年10月以来，信贷合作社又重新活跃起来，它们有权吸收农民的存款。并且向农民发放贷款。社的管理人员由社员选举，实现民主办社，但是在财政上要受国家银行的控制和监督。
