    Japanese Ukiyo-e Woodcuts Exhibited in Beijing
    (Our newspaper reports) The "Japanese Ukiyo-e Woodcut Exhibition" began on August 11th at the Capital Art Exhibition Hall, attracting a wide audience in the capital.

    Ukiyo-e woodcuts, a type of folk print that arose during the Japanese Tokugawa period (1603-1867), are a precious national artistic heritage of the Japanese people, rich in distinct national style.

    The subjects of these works are very broad, including depictions of the customs of the citizens of the time, works dedicated to depicting the lives of women, carvings of theatrical plots and famous actors, representations of war stories, classical masterpieces, folk tales, and historical figures, as well as depictions of beautiful mountains and rivers, still lifes, and flowers and birds... Therefore, it has been said that Ukiyo-e woodcuts are an encyclopedia of folk life during the Japanese Tokugawa period.

    The main characteristic of Ukiyo-e woodcuts, however, is the thoughts and feelings embodied in these works. Ukiyo-e woodcut artists praised the civic life of the time, loathed feudal ethics, extolled freedom of life and free love, admired the advanced society of Europe at the time, and even some works directly satirized the feudal rule of the Tokugawa shogunate, thus becoming extremely popular among the people and greatly loved by the citizens.

    During its development of two hundred and several decades, Ukiyo-e woodcuts saw the emergence of thirty to forty large and small schools, and more than eight hundred painters and printmakers, forming an unprecedented magnificent realm in the history of Japanese printmaking.

    Mr. Lu Xun attached great importance to Ukiyo-e woodcuts during his lifetime and conducted planned collection work, but unfortunately, he passed away before his work was completed.

    The exhibition features a total of one hundred and fourteen works by fifty printmakers, arranged and selected according to the historical development sequence. Through this exhibition, the audience showed great interest in the content and expressive techniques of Ukiyo-e woodcuts. The People's Fine Arts Publishing House has also decided to compile and print a selection of Japanese Ukiyo-e woodcuts as a reference for the study of foreign folk prints.

    The exhibition is scheduled to run for eight days and will close on August 18.

    日本浮世绘木刻在京展出
    本报讯  “日本浮世绘木刻展览会”从8月11日开始，在首都美术展览馆公开展出，吸引了首都广大的观众。
    浮世绘木刻，是日本德川时代（1603—1867）兴起的一种民间版画，也是日本人民宝贵的民族艺术遗产，富有鲜明的民族风格。
    这类作品的题材十分广泛，有描写当时市民风俗的，有专门描写妇女生活的，有刻划戏剧情节和著名演员的，有表现战争故事、古典名著、民间传说和历史人物的，也有描绘美丽山川、静物和花鸟的……，因此曾有人说，浮世绘木刻是日本德川时代民间生活的百科全书。
    浮世绘木刻的主要特点，却是这类作品之中所体现的思想感情。浮世绘木刻家歌颂当时的市民生活，厌恶封建礼教，赞美生活自由和自由恋爱，景慕当时欧洲的先进社会，甚至还有一些作品直接嘲讽德川幕府的封建统治，因而在民间流行极广，倍受市民的爱戴。
    浮世绘木刻，在它发展的二百数十年间，出现了三、四十个大小流派，涌现了八百名以上的画家与版画家，形成了日本版画史上空前的壮丽境界。
    鲁迅先生生前十分重视浮世绘木刻，并且进行了有计划的搜集工作，但不幸他的工作尚未完成就与我们永别了。
    这次展出的作品，共计五十位版画家的一百一十四幅，是按照历史的发展顺序编排选择的。经过这次展出观众对于浮世绘木刻的内容和表现技巧，表现了极大的兴趣。人民美术出版社也决定编印一册日本浮世绘木刻选集，作为研究外国民间版画的参考。
    这次展览会预定展出八天，将于8月18日闭幕。
