Opposing Marxism While Cloaked in Marxism
Rightist Rong Mengyuan is a Swindler in the Field of Historiography

(Our Dispatch) For nearly half a month, all personnel of the Third Institute of the Institute of History, Chinese Academy of Sciences, have been holding meetings to expose and criticize the reactionary words and deeds of Rong Mengyuan, a rightist researcher at the institute. Some people who were once under his command or were used by him have also made some confessions one after another. In June, Rong Mengyuan wrote an article entitled "Suggestions on Compiling Historical Materials Since the Revolution of 1911" and published it in "New Construction." The content of this article is actually a supplement to the Zhang-Luo alliance's "scientific program" regarding history.

In this "program," Rong Mengyuan opposed the guiding role of Marxism in historical research and advocated the restoration of old historiography. His method was to eliminate the guidance of Marxism under the guise of advocating the simultaneous coexistence of various styles, emphasizing the importance of materials, and inheriting traditions. He criticized: "Currently, the history since the Revolution of 1911…only (changed to "mostly") consists of essays with narrative and commentary," "Replacing everything with essays hinders the research of historical science." He believed that there was no need to critically accept China's historical traditions with a Marxist viewpoint, and proposed that "the various styles of our country's traditional historiography are all flowers, and they should bloom together with the flowers of essay styles." Furthermore, "we should first inherit our country's excellent historiographical traditions and write materials in various styles." He actually wanted to replace everything with feudal and capitalist old historiography, or to contend with Marxism using feudal and bourgeois ideas. Rong Mengyuan made vicious attacks against the Party's ideological leadership. He distorted the words of some Party members and then tried his best to attack them. He said, "Some people say 'What is the Jishi Benmo style?' 'Separate research is bourgeois ideology,' 'This is a purely professional viewpoint,' 'This is divorced from politics.' I think this statement is very ignorant and definitely not a scientific attitude." This passage was even more vicious in his original manuscript. The original text was, "I think this statement is very ignorant, but I can only slander in my heart, I dare not say it out loud, slandering should be beheaded, but there is nothing to express, others don't know, what can I do!" This showed his extreme hatred for the Party's criticism of bourgeois ideology. Rong Mengyuan fabricated facts and incited discord in the "program."

During the rectification campaign, Rong Mengyuan publicly published articles to attack the Party on the one hand, and carried out a series of activities in the Third Institute of History to slander and oppose the Party on the other. He first proposed that the criticism of his anti-Party sectarian activities in the Third Institute of History in 1953 was a "conspiracy and frame-up." The fact is: Before 1953, Rong Mengyuan engaged in small cliques within the institute to carry out anti-Party sectarian activities, which had a very bad impact. In October 1953, under the leadership of the Party, all the staff of the institute conducted a serious criticism of their sectarian activities. However, Rong Mengyuan did not repent, and this time he maliciously slandered the Party by taking advantage of the rectification opportunity.

Rong Mengyuan colluded with rightist research intern Zhang Zhenhe from the very beginning. Other rightists in the institute and some people with erroneous ideas also flocked to Rong's door at this time, spreading reactionary remarks and carrying out incitement activities. For a period of time, Rong Mengyuan actually became the central figure of the rightists in the Third Institute of History.

Rong Mengyuan's anti-Party activities are consistent. He was born into a landlord family and joined the revolution in 1932. But at a critical juncture of the revolution, he betrayed the Party and voluntarily surrendered to the Kuomintang, betraying revolutionary comrades. After that, he joined the reactionary organization Qingbang and became an apprentice under a division commander of the warlord Sun Chuanfang. During the December 9th Movement, he concealed his reactionary history and sneaked into the Party again. In 1941, he continued to carry out anti-Party activities in Yan'an, openly opposing the Northwest Bureau of the Party Central Committee, and was expelled from the Party. After the Party criticized his anti-Party sectarian activities at the end of 1953, it continued to help him and expressed its trust in him, entrusting him with a lot of work. But the essence of this rightist ambitionist has never changed.

In recent days of criticism, everyone also pointed out: Rong Mengyuan, this ambitionist, has a little false reputation in society, and some people regard him as a Marxist "historian," but in fact he is a swindler in the field of historiography.

Plagiarizing other people's works is an even more prominent phenomenon in Rong Mengyuan's "writings." For example, his book "A Brief History of the Chinese Revolution in the Last Hundred Years" is a book compiled by plagiarizing and piecing together large sections of text. The first chapter and first section of this book, a total of more than 1,800 words, are almost entirely copied from the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." But he only used more than 700 words as quotations, and plagiarized the remaining 800 words as his own "creation."

What is even worse is that he took advantage of the convenience of editing "Modern History Materials" and other work to suppress other people's manuscripts and steal other people's research results as his own. Mr. Zhang Guogan wrote a draft of "A Brief History of the Revolution of 1911" (unpublished) and sent it to Rong Mengyuan for comments. He took the opportunity to copy the material about Hong Shuzu into his own book and publish it first.

At the criticism meeting, the masses unanimously pointed out: Rong Mengyuan is a rightist ambitionist with bad character and a deceiver who steals fame. He must make a thorough confession of his reactionary words and deeds!

### 披着马克思主义的外衣反对马克思主义  右派分子荣孟源是史学界的骗子

    披着马克思主义的外衣反对马克思主义
    右派分子荣孟源是史学界的骗子
    本报讯　近半个月来，中国科学院历史研究所第三所全体人员连日开会揭露和批判该所研究员右派分子荣孟源的反动言行。一些曾受他指挥或被他利用的人也相继作了一些交代。6月间，荣孟源写了一篇题为“建议编撰辛亥革命以来的历史资料”的文章在“新建设”发表。这篇文章的内容实际上是章罗联盟“科学纲领”的关于历史学方面的补充。
    荣孟源在这个“纲领”中反对马克思主义对历史研究的指导作用，提倡恢复旧史学。他的办法是在主张各种体裁同时并存、强调要重视资料、继承传统等口号的掩盖下，取消马克思主义的指导。他指责说：“目前辛亥革命以来的历史……只有（发表时改为“多是”）夹叙夹议的论文”“以论文来代替一切，那就妨害了历史科学的研究”。他认为不需要用马克思主义观点对中国的历史学传统批判的接受，而提出“我国传统历史学的各种体裁都是一种花，都要和论文体裁的花一起开放”。并且“首先应继承我国优良的史学传统，撰述各种体裁的资料”。他实际上就是要用封建的、资本主义的旧史学来代替一切，或者用封建的、资产阶级的思想与马克思主义分庭抗礼。荣孟源针对着党的思想领导作了恶毒的攻击。他把一些党员说过的话加以歪曲，然后极力攻击，他说：“有人说‘纪事本末体算什么东西’、‘分别研究是资产阶级思想’、‘这是单纯业务观点’、‘这是脱离政治’，我认为这种说法很无知，绝不是科学态度”。这一段话在他的原稿中更加恶毒。原文是“我认为这种说法很无知，可是只能腹诽，不敢说出口来，腹诽应当杀头，可是无所表示，他人不知，其奈我何！”这表示出他对于党对资产阶级思想的批判是非常仇恨的。荣孟源在“纲领”中捏造事实煽动挑拨。
    整风期间，荣孟源一方面公开发表文章向党进攻，一方面在历史三所进行了一系列的诬蔑党反对党的活动。他首先提出1953年历史三所对他反党宗派活动的批判是“阴谋陷害”。事实是：1953年以前荣孟源在所内搞小集团进行反党宗派活动影响极坏。1953年10月，在党的领导下，全所人员对他们的宗派活动进行了严肃的批判。可是，荣孟源并没有憣然悔悟，这次借着整风的机会对党恶意诬蔑。
    荣孟源一开始就与右派分子研究实习员张振鹤狼狈为奸。所内其他右派分子和一些有错误思想的人这时也都奔集荣的门下，散布反动言论，进行点火活动。在一个时期内，荣孟源实际上成了历史三所右派分子的中心人物。
    荣孟源的反党活动是有一贯性的。他出生于地主家庭，在1932年参加了革命。但在革命的紧要关头叛变了党，自动地向国民党自首，出卖革命同志。此后，他就参加了反动组织青帮，投到军阀孙传芳部下的一个师长门下当徒弟。一二九运动时，隐瞒自己的反动历史，又混进党内。1941年在延安继续进行反党活动，公开地反对党中央西北局，被开除出党。1953年底，党对他的反党宗派活动进行批判后，仍然不断地对他进行帮助，并对他表示信任，委托他做不少的工作。但这个右派野心家的本质始终并没有改变。
    在近些天来的批判中，大家还指出：荣孟源这个野心家在社会上有一点点虚名，有人把他当作是一个马克思主义的“史学家”，其实他是个史学界的骗子。
    抄袭别人的作品更是荣孟源“著作”中的突出现象。例如他的“中国近百年革命史略”一书，即是大量地整段地剽窃抄袭，拼凑成书。这书开头的第一章第一节共一千八百余字，几乎全是抄引“毛泽东选集”。但他只把其中七百多字作为引文，其余八百多字便剽窃为自己的“创作”。
    更加恶劣的是，他利用编辑“近代史资料”等工作的便利，压制别人的稿件，把别人的研究成果窍为己有。张国淦先生写了“辛亥革命史略”（尚未出版）一稿送给荣孟源提意见，他乘机把其中关于洪述祖的材料先抄在自己的书里发表了。
    在批判会上，群众一致指出：荣孟源是一个品质恶劣，欺世盗名的右派野心分子，要他必须对自己的反动言行，作出彻底的交代！
