Xinhua News Agency, August 22nd: More than 3,000 people from the capital's architectural circles held a meeting today to expose and criticize the right-wing anti-communist alliance of Chen Zhanxiang and Hua Lanhong, chief engineers of the Beijing Municipal Urban Planning Bureau's Design Institute.

Xiao Ping, vice president of the Beijing Design Institute, revealed that the Chen-Hua alliance consistently hated the Party's leadership over Beijing's urban construction and overall planning. They slandered the Beijing Municipal Party Committee's strengthening of leadership over overall planning as "sectarianism," demanding that the Party withdraw from planning and design institutions and organize a "review committee" with their participation to review the overall plan. Chen Zhanxiang everywhere falsely accused Beijing's overall planning scheme as a "formalistic, divorced from reality, divorced from the masses," a "heavenly book" that "caused so much suffering to ordinary people," falsely accusing comrades of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee responsible for leading planning work as "standing deep in the clouds, unable to see the suffering of the world," and clamoring to "break the socialist framework," advocating that the design office have more "autonomy" and "blindly and spontaneously carry out urban construction," attempting to take the capitalist road of private architectural firms. In his "ten-thousand-word letter," Hua Lanhong proposed the principle of "metabolism, cyclical construction," opposing the central government's principle of "suitability, economy, and attention to aesthetics where possible," and "a century-long plan, quality first."

In order to achieve their anti-Party goals, Chen Zhanxiang and Hua Lanhong formed an anti-Party alliance during the Great Blooming and Contending, and formulated a plan of "Chen attacking planning, Hua attacking construction." Chen Zhanxiang, who called himself a "small fan" fanning the flames, in addition to slandering the Party for treating architects as "drawing machines" to provoke the relationship between the Party and architects, also took advantage of the opportunity to visit Shanghai, adopting methods such as "private visits" and "holding forums," attempting to instigate Shanghai's architects to oppose Beijing's overall plan.

Liang Sicheng, chairman of the Beijing branch of the Architectural Society of China, said that right-wing elements in the architectural field, such as Chen Zhanxiang and Hua Lanhong, not only negate the great achievements made by the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Party in the past eight years, but also maliciously distort the facts, spread rumors, and lie. They formed an anti-Party alliance, their common goal is to vainly attempt to overthrow the Party's leadership in the architectural field, to drag our urban construction and architectural cause back to the anarchy of capitalism, so that they can reign supreme in the architectural field. This is absolutely impossible.

Zhong Guosheng, an engineer of the Beijing Municipal Urban Planning Committee, listed many facts on the spot to refute Chen Zhanxiang and Hua Lanhong's obliteration of the capital's construction achievements over the past eight years, and their lies that the Communist Party "lacks the same energy as it did when it filled in Longxugou" and that "urban construction is not as closely related to the interests of the masses as before." He said that in the past eight years, the newly built residential area in Beijing is equal to three times the total new construction area in the eighteen years before liberation. After filling in Longxugou, the Party and the government eliminated ten more "Longxugou," and are now turning the largest "Longxugou" in the urban area - the moat - into clear water, and turning the stinking ditches such as Longtan and Taoranting into beautiful parks. The number of public water stations installed in working people's residential areas and suburban rural areas has increased nearly tenfold compared with the early days of liberation. Zhong Guosheng questioned Chen Zhanxiang and Hua Lanhong, saying that these facts prove that the Party and the government are always concerned about the interests of the masses, why do you have to open your eyes and tell lies, you must honestly confess.

Chen Zhanxiang and Hua Lanhong spread many reactionary remarks among the teachers and students of the Department of Architecture of Tsinghua University, which had a very bad influence. Wu Liangyong, deputy director of the Department of Architecture of Tsinghua University, revealed at today's meeting that Chen Zhanxiang negated Beijing's construction achievements and overall plan among teachers and students, and wanted to study bathhouses, teahouses, Tianqiao, and the Qing Dynasty's barracks, and to go to the Liubiju Sauce Garden Shop to appreciate beauty and absorb design inspiration on the pickle jars. When the Beijing Tongrentang Pharmacy renovated its facade to meet business needs, Chen Zhanxiang scolded it as "destroying" the atmosphere. Hua Lanhong boasted at Tsinghua University that he was a "great architect," and now his "creativity" is supposedly "suppressed," so some students who were deceived by him said that they "cannot engage in architecture under the leadership of the Party" and wanted to go to places without Party leadership after graduation to "exert their creativity." Wu Liangyong also revealed Chen Zhanxiang and Hua Lanhong's malicious slander of the Soviet Union and the Soviet experts who helped our country with construction.

This Chen Zhanxiang, who called himself an "urban planning expert," revealed his true colors under everyone's exposure. Chen Zhanxiang was originally an anti-communist expert promoted by Kang Ze, a complete foreign slave. When he was studying architecture in the UK, he received subsidies from the Kuomintang Embassy in the UK to carry out anti-communist activities. At the beginning of 1945, Kang Ze also sent him as the "head of the Chinese Youth Delegation" to attend the World Youth Representative Conference held in London. In 1946, on his way back to China, Chen Cheng sent a telegram asking him to go to Lushan to attend the representative conference of the Three People's Principles Youth League. After returning to China, he was also received by Chiang Kai-shek and Soong Mei-ling.

Chen Zhanxiang and Hua Lanhong made confessions at the meeting. However, these two right-wing elements were extremely dishonest, their confessions were irrelevant and empty, attempting to muddle through. The meeting demanded that these two right-wing elements must honestly and thoroughly confess. The meeting will continue to be held.

　　城市建设必须有领导有计划
　  首都建筑界批驳陈华联盟的恶毒阴谋
    新华社22日讯　首都建筑界三千多人今天举行大会，揭露和批判北京市城市规划管理局设计院总工程师陈占祥、华揽洪的右派反共联盟。
    北京市设计院副院长肖平揭露陈、华联盟一贯仇视党对北京市城市建设和总体规划的领导。他们诬蔑中共北京市委加强对总体规划的领导是“宗派主义”，要党退出规划设计机构，组织由他们参加的“审查委员会”来审查总体规划。陈占祥到处诬蔑北京的规划总图方案是一本“形式主义、脱离实际、脱离群众”，“引起多少凡人苦恼”的“天书”，诬蔑中共北京市委会负责领导规划工作的同志是“站在云层深处，看不到人间疾苦”，扬言要“打破社会主义的框子”，主张设计室有更多的“自决权”，“盲目自发地进行城市建设”，企图走私人建筑事务所的资本主义道路。华揽洪在他的“万言书”中，提出“新陈代谢、循环建设”的方针，反对中央提出的“适用、经济，在可能条件下注意美观”、“百年大计、质量第一”的方针。
    为了达到他们的反党目的，陈占祥和华揽洪在大鸣大放期间结成反党联盟，订出了“陈攻规划，华攻建设”的计划。自称是煽火的“小扇子”的陈占祥，除了污蔑党把建筑师当成“描图机器”，来挑拨党和建筑师的关系外，还利用到上海去参观的机会，采取“私访”“开座谈会”等方法，企图煽动上海的建筑师们来反对北京的总体规划。
    中国建筑学会北京分会理事长梁思成说，建筑界的右派分子陈占祥、华揽洪之流，不仅否定全国人民八年来在党的领导下所取得的巨大成绩，而且恶意地颠倒黑白，造谣、撒谎。他们结成反党联盟，他们的共同目标是妄想推翻党在建筑领域中的领导，是要把我们的城市建设和建筑事业拖回到资本主义的无政府状态中去，让他们在建筑界称王作霸。这是绝对办不到的。
    北京市都市规划委员会工程师钟国生当场列举许多事实，驳斥陈占祥和华揽洪抹煞首都八年来的建设成就，说共产党“缺乏当年填平龙须沟那末一股劲”、“城市建设与群众利益不像从前那样密切”的谎话。他说，八年来北京新建的住宅面积就等于解放前十八年中所有的新建筑面积的三倍。党和政府继填平龙须沟之后，又消灭了十条“龙须沟”，现在正把城区最大的“龙须沟”——护城河变成清水，把龙潭、陶然亭等臭水沟改变成美丽的公园。在劳动人民居住地区和郊区农村安装的公共水站比解放初期增加了近十倍。钟国生责问陈占祥和华揽洪说，这些事实证明党和政府时时刻刻在关心着群众利益，你们为什么要睁着眼睛说瞎话，必须老实交代。
    陈占祥和华揽洪在清华大学建筑系师生中散布的许多反动言行，产生了很恶劣的影响。清华大学建筑系副主任吴良镛在今天会上揭发说，陈占祥在师生中否定北京的建设成就和总体规划，而要去研究洗澡堂、茶馆、天桥和清朝的营房，要到六必居酱园店去在酱菜缸上欣赏美、吸取设计灵感。北京同仁堂药店为了满足营业需要改装了门面，陈占祥就大骂“破坏”了气氛。华揽洪在清华大学炫耀他是“大建筑师”，现在他的“创造性”受到所谓“压制”，因此有些受了他的欺骗的学生说，在“党的领导下不能搞建筑”，要在毕业以后到没有党领导的地方去“发挥创造”。吴良镛还揭发了陈占祥、华揽洪恶意污蔑苏联和帮助我国建设的苏联专家的言行。
    这个自封为“城市规划专家”的陈占祥，在大家揭发下露出了真面目。陈占祥原来是康泽一手提拔起来的反共专家，十足的洋奴才。他在英国学建筑时，就在国民党驻英大使馆支领津贴进行反共活动。康泽在1945年初还派他作为“中国青年代表团团长”，出席伦敦举行的世界青年代表会。1946年，陈占祥在回国途中，陈诚又打电报要他去庐山参加三青团的代表大会。回国以后，还得到蒋介石和宋美龄的召见。
    陈占祥、华揽洪在大会上作了交代。但是这两个右派分子极不老实，交代中东拉西扯，空洞无物，企图蒙混过关。大会要这两个右派分子必须老实地彻底地交代。大会还将继续举行。
