Communist Party member Lin Tiqiang, an assistant researcher in the Agricultural Implements Department of the East China Agricultural Science Institute, has persisted in scientific research through numerous difficulties, and his research on rice transplanters has achieved preliminary success. However, his fruits of labor were once taken away, and he was subjected to exclusion and attacks in many ways. The truth of this matter was only thoroughly understood after the unfolding of the anti-Rightist struggle recently.

Lin Tiqiang is forty-nine years old and has not received higher education. He used to farm the land, teach elementary school, and participated in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation. Because of his love for scientific research and his hard work, in 1952, the Party sent him to the Agricultural Implements Department of the East China Agricultural Science Institute for advanced studies. However, the head of this department, Jiang Yao, and others considered him a "bumpkin" without culture and discriminated against and belittled him. Lin Tiqiang, together with a Communist Party member, researched wind-powered plowing machines, but Jiang Yao and others tried every possible means to obstruct it, and finally, this experimental project was removed. With the support of the Party, Lin Tiqiang transferred to the windmill group of the Agricultural Implements Department to participate in research work.

Communist Party member Lin Tiqiang did not lose heart. Although he was in the windmill group, he continued to care about other research work in the department. At this time, farmers from various places successively wrote letters requesting that the rice transplanter be successfully researched as soon as possible. However, this research work in the department was personally presided over by Jiang Yao. For several years since it started in 1952, there had been no results on the key issues of seedling separation and delivery of the rice transplanter. In early 1955, at a department meeting, Jiang Yao, using the excuse that "Italy has not succeeded in decades of research," proposed to cancel this research or change the direction to only study semi-mechanized transplanters with manual seedling separation and mechanical transplanting. Lin Tiqiang expressed his disagreement and persuaded everyone to retain this important research topic. He himself also used his spare time to study the automatic separation and delivery of seedlings. Every day after work, Lin Tiqiang brought a handful of seedlings home from the greenhouse and tried every possible way to separate them at night. Finally, he successfully experimented with a wooden board nailed with tines. Later, he realized the principle of the seedling delivery machine from the movement of the typewriter. On International Labor Day, May 1, 1955, he made a model of a rice transplanter based on the results of his research, presented it to Jiang Yao as a rationalization proposal, and performed a model demonstration on the spot. Who knew that after Jiang Yao saw it, he only said coldly, "It's useless!"

Lin Tiqiang was rebuffed and thought, "I have low education and cannot argue with others in theory, so I will use facts to illustrate." So, with the encouragement and support of the Party branch, he insisted on research and used his night rest time to study drawing and design structures. In this way, he worked day and night for more than half a year. By the Spring Festival in February 1956, when others went on vacation, he still worked every day, acting as a carpenter and a blacksmith, and hammered together a rice transplanter that could automatically separate and deliver seedlings. After the Spring Festival, he enthusiastically asked Jiang Yao for appraisal. Who knew that Jiang Yao, without looking carefully, disdainfully said to Lin Tiqiang, "This cannot solve the row alignment problem, it won't work!" Lin Tiqiang then put forward his own argument, thinking that row alignment was a field operation problem and easy to solve, but Jiang Yao ignored it. When the rice transplanter research group meeting was held, Lin Tiqiang was still excluded from the door and not allowed to participate in the research. At the meeting, someone requested to review Lin's creative design, and someone volunteered to invite Lin to participate in the meeting, but they were all stopped by Jiang Yao.

Lin Tiqiang was very angry, but he also thought, "My machine has only been tested indoors, let's talk about it after a field test." Once, when Jiang Yao and others wanted to test their designed disc-type rice transplanter, Lin Tiqiang also carried his machine to the field and followed behind for testing. At that time, many people inside and outside the institute visited. The on-the-spot performance results showed that Jiang Yao and others' machine failed, while Lin Tiqiang's machine was praised by relevant experts and leaders of the institute. At this time, some researchers in the department also began to help Lin Tiqiang in mechanical construction. However, Jiang Yao still stubbornly ignored it. In February and March 1956, a national symposium on paddy field agricultural implements was held in Hangzhou. Jiang Yao called back from Hangzhou to send the disc-type transplanter he researched for performance. People in the department proposed to Jiang Yao to also send the one researched by Lin Tiqiang. Jiang did not agree. Later, after the Deputy Director Liu Zhengfa proposed it, Lin Tiqiang's machine was also sent. The performance of Lin's machine in Hangzhou was good. After this, Jiang Yao changed from suppression to shameless plagiarism, hurriedly sent Lin Tiqiang back to Nanjing, and he himself treated this machine as his own research in Hangzhou, and publicly introduced the "research process," without mentioning Lin Tiqiang. At this time, Lin Tiqiang in Nanjing, together with other staff, processed and rushed to make a better machine, which was transported to Wuhan in April of the same year to participate in the National Rice Transplanter Research Symposium. When Jiang Yao read out a long speech outline drafted by others on his behalf to introduce the successful research process of the rice transplanter, he even wiped out Lin Tiqiang's name from it, attributing everything to himself.

Communist Party member Lin Tiqiang did not care about these things at all, and wholeheartedly hoped to improve the machine as soon as possible. At this time, a central research group was established in the East China Agricultural Science Institute by personnel from the national rice transplanter research, with Lin Tiqiang's machine as the basis for research, and Jiang Yao as the leader. But after returning to Nanjing, in the work of further research and improvement, Jiang Yao and others acted as if they were the inventors and did not allow Lin Tiqiang to intervene much. Lin Tiqiang proposed to replace the seedling door baffle with a steel wire curtain to improve the uniformity of seedling separation and reduce the rate of seedling damage, but Jiang Yao and others did not accept it. Lin Tiqiang had to make it himself privately and then try it in public. Only after the experiment was successful was it recognized. Jiang Yao and others, regardless of Lin Tiqiang's repeated objections, insisted on changing the small boat on the machine to a wooden support, which resulted in failure and then changed back. After the initial success of the experiment in July last year, Jiang Yao sent the machine drawings to Beijing for trial production in his own name, without letting Lin Tiqiang know in advance. When Lin Tiqiang temporarily learned about it and suggested that it would be best to conduct further research and improvement from the two directions of lightness and simplicity before taking it out, Jiang Yao ignored it. Lin Tiqiang had to continue to study and improve it himself. As a result, this spring, a machine that Lin Tiqiang modified himself was better when it was used in rural areas, while the ten machines made by Jiang Yao and others in Beijing did not perform well in various places. However, Jiang Yao still wrote papers and gave reports in his own name, stealing other people's research results.

In May this year, Lin Tiqiang was testing the machine in the countryside, and the entire institute was also launching a big blooming and contending. When he returned to the Agricultural Implements Department, the rightists had already lined up the Communist Party members to prepare for the struggle, and Lin Tiqiang was listed as the first one. Then the rightists posted defamatory big-character posters against Lin Tiqiang and verbally abused and clamored against him at three meetings. Lin Tiqiang was not intimidated by the rightists at this time and was still determined to continue his research work.

Now, the reactionary features of Zhou Shilu, the vice president of the East China Agricultural Science Institute who has always excluded and attacked worker-peasant cadres, and Jiang Yao, the head of the department, and other rightists have been fully exposed. People who were influenced by Jiang Yao and others in the past have also begun to awaken and have risen up to expose and criticize the reactionary words and deeds of the rightist Jiang Yao. While actively participating in the anti-Rightist struggle, Lin Tiqiang continues his research work. He said, "The success of the machine is entirely due to the strength of the Party. Without the Party, I would not have today!"

　　冲破右派分子重围　坚持科学研究成功
　　——共产党员林体强试制水稻插秧机的曲折道路
　　新华社记者　魏文华
    华东农业科学研究所农具系助理研究员共产党员林体强，在重重困难中坚持科学研究，对水稻插秧机的研究已经得到初步成就。但是他的劳动果实一度被人夺去，还在许多方面受到排斥打击，这件事的真象直到最近反右派斗争展开以后才彻底弄明白。
    林体强四十九岁，没有受过高等教育，过去种过田，教过小学，参加过抗日战争和解放战争。由于他爱好科学研究和刻苦钻研，1952年，党就送他到华东农业科学研究所农具系深造。但是这个系的系主任蒋耀等人却认为他是“土包子”，没有文化，歧视和轻视他。林体强同一位共产党员一起研究风力耕田机，蒋耀等人却千方百计地阻挠，最后竟把这一试验课题删去。在党的支持下，林体强转到农具系风车组参加研究工作。
    共产党员林体强没有灰心，他自己虽在风车组，但还不断关怀系内其他方面的研究工作。这时各地农民陆续有人来信，要求把水稻插秧机早日研究成功。但系里的这一项研究工作是由蒋耀亲自主持的，从1952年开始后几年中，对水稻插秧机的分秧、送秧等关键问题一直没有结果。到1955年初，在一次系务会议上蒋耀借口“意大利研究几十年不成功”，提出取消这一项研究，或者改变方针，只研究半机械化的人工分秧和机械插秧的插秧机。林体强表示不同意，并且说服大家把这一个重要的研究课题保留下来，他自己也利用业余时间，研究自动分秧和送秧问题。每天下班时，林体强从温室带一把秧苗到家，在晚上想尽各种办法分秧，最后用一块木板钉了钉齿试验成功。后来他又从打字机的运动中悟出送秧机原理。在1955年“五一”国际劳动节那天，他根据研究的结果制成水稻插秧机的模型，作为合理化建议向蒋耀提出，并当场作了模型表演。谁知蒋耀看了后只冷冷地说了一句：“没有用！”
    林体强碰了钉子，心想：“我文化低，理论上说不过别人，就用事实来说明吧。”于是他便在党支部的鼓励和支持下坚持研究，利用晚上休息时间研究制图，设计构造。这样他夜以继日地干了半年多，到1956年2月春节时，别人休假去了；他仍天天工作，一个人当了木匠又当铁匠，七敲八打地装成一架能够自动分秧送秧的水稻插秧机。春节后，他兴致勃勃地请蒋耀鉴定，谁知蒋耀并未细看就鄙夷地对林体强说：“这不能解决对行问题，不行！”林体强当时提出自己的论点，认为对行是田间操作问题，好解决，但蒋耀不理。在召开水稻插秧机研究组会议时，林体强仍被排拒在门外，不准参加研究；在会上有人要求审查林的创造性设计，并且有人自愿要去请林参加会议，但都被蒋耀制止了。
    林体强一边很气愤，一边又想：“我的机器只在室内试验过，到田间试验后再说。”有一次，蒋耀等人要试验他们设计的圆盘式水稻插秧机，林体强也把自己的机器抬到田间跟在后面试验。当时所内外有很多人参观，当场表演结果，蒋耀等人的机器失败了，林体强的机器则受到有关专家和所里领导的称赞。这时系里有的研究人员也开始在机械构造方面帮助林体强。但是蒋耀仍然顽固地不加理睬。1956年2、3月在杭州举行全国水田农具座谈会，蒋耀由杭州打电话回来要把他研究的圆盘式插秧机送去表演，系内的人向蒋耀提出要把林体强研究的一架也送去。蒋不同意。以后经副所长刘正发提出，才把林体强那架机器也送去了。林的机器在杭州表演结果良好。这以后，蒋耀乃一变压制而为无耻的剽窃，匆匆打发林体强回南京，他自己则在杭州把这架机器当作自己研究出来的，还公然介绍“研究经过”，只字不提林体强。林体强这时在南京和其他工作人员一起加工赶制了一部更好的机器，在同年4月运到武汉参加全国水稻插秧机研究座谈会。蒋耀在会上宣读别人代他起草的长篇发言提纲介绍水稻插秧机研究成功经过时，竟把其中林体强的名字抹去，把一切归功于他自己。
    共产党员林体强根本不计较这些，一心希望赶快把机器研究得更好。这时在华东农业科学研究所由全国研究水稻插秧机的人员设立中心研究组，以林体强的机子为基础进行研究，由蒋耀任组长。但回到南京后在进一步研究改进的工作中，蒋耀等俨然以发明者自居，竟不许林体强多插手了。林体强提出用钢丝帘代替秧门档板，提高分秧的均匀度，减少伤秧率，蒋耀等不接受，林体强只好自己私下制好了再当众试用，试验成功，才被承认。蒋耀等还不顾林体强多次反对，硬把机器上的小船改为木托，结果失败了又改回来。去年7月试验初步成功后，蒋耀以自己名义把这个机器图样送到北京试制，事先根本不让林体强知道，当林体强临时知道，提出最好从轻便和简单两个方向再加研究改进以后再拿出去，蒋耀不加理睬。林体强只得自己继续研究改进。结果，今年春天林体强自己改装的一架机器到农村试用较好，而蒋耀等在北京制的十架在各地试用情况不佳。但是蒋耀仍旧以自己名义写论文，作报告，窃取别人的研究成果。
    今年5月间，林体强在农村里试验机器，全所也在大鸣大放。当他回到农具系时，右派分子们已经把共产党员排了队准备斗争，林体强被列为第一名。接着右派分子对林体强贴出诬蔑性的大字报，在三次会上对他谩骂叫嚣。林体强这时没有被右派分子吓倒，仍然决心继续自己的研究工作。
    现在，一向排斥打击工农干部的华东农业科学研究所副所长周拾禄和系主任蒋耀等右派分子的反动面目已经充分被揭发出来了，过去受到蒋耀等影响的人也开始觉悟，起而揭发和批判右派分子蒋耀的反动言行。林体强一面积极参加反右派斗争，一面继续研究工作，他说：“机器的成功，完全是党的力量，没有党，我根本没有今天！”
