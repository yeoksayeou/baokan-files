Shanghai, August 15th (Reported by our newspaper) – Over a thousand cultural and art workers in Shanghai held a large-scale anti-Rightist debate in the past two days, using facts to wage a war against Rightist fallacies. The focus of the debate was on questions such as: "Since liberation, have the achievements of Shanghai's cultural and art undertakings been the main thing? Is it a complete mess?" and "Can the Party lead artistic endeavors?"

Chen Shiming, Director of the Cataloging Department of the Shanghai People's Library, refuted the Rightists' slander that "the library undertaking in New China is also a complete mess" with his personal experiences before and after liberation. He said: Before liberation, there was only one public library in the entire city of Shanghai. The total collection consisted of approximately 90,000 Chinese books and 20,000 Western books. The library's funding was pitiful. In the first half of 1948, its entire office and operating expenses were barely enough to cover the monthly water and electricity bills. In the short few years after liberation, the number of staff in our library has increased fourfold, the book collection has increased eightfold, and the number of readers has increased twenty to thirtyfold. This is incomparable to the period of reactionary rule. Moreover, the target audience of the library has also changed greatly since liberation. In the past, there were very few worker-peasant readers; now, workers account for more than 30% of readers at peak times.

Yang Yingwu, Secretary of the Arts Committee of the Shanghai People's Art Theater, forcefully exposed the Rightists' conspiracy to smear the people's drama cause with examples of the unprecedented prosperity of the drama undertaking after liberation. Yang Yingwu said: From a national perspective, a total of sixty-one drama troupes and theaters have been established since liberation, along with fifty-two publicly-assisted private drama troupes. According to estimates in the first half of 1955, there were as many as 100,000 amateur drama troupes in factories and villages across the country, with a total of about three million people. Such a large drama contingent is unprecedented in Chinese history. Taking the "Shanghai People's Art Theater" as an example, although there are many shortcomings in its work, its achievements cannot be denied. Compared with the pre-liberation era, the predecessor of the "People's Art Theater" was "Drama Team Nine," which performed a total of only 786 shows in the eleven years from 1937 to 1948, while the "People's Art Theater" performed 823 shows in the two years from 1955 to 1956 alone. From 1944 to 1948, "Drama Team Nine" had a total audience of more than 215,000 people, while the audience number of the "People's Art Theater" in the first half of this year alone exceeded the total audience of the "Drama Team Nine" in five years. Since liberation, the work of the People's Art Theater has been continuously progressing. The Rightists' claim that the work of the "People's Art Theater" is deteriorating is completely slanderous.

The famous singer Zhou Xiaoyan said at the meeting that Shanghai, known as the cradle of Chinese music, had only one symphony orchestra before liberation, and the vast majority of conductors and performers were foreigners. The Shanghai Music College, which was established for twenty-two years, had only seventy-four students at the time of liberation. Now, Shanghai has six professional music and dance groups: a symphony orchestra, a song and dance troupe, a national orchestra, a wind orchestra, a chorus, and an experimental opera house. The music conservatory in Shanghai has three hundred students. Its equipment, such as pianos, records, and books, is ten times more than that of the former music college. It also has an affiliated middle school and a children's music school. In recent years, the music conservatory has cultivated many outstanding musical talents, and many have won honors in international competitions.

Xiao Wenyan, an actress from the People's Huai Opera Troupe, forcefully refuted the Rightists' fallacy that the Party cannot lead artistic endeavors with the different situations of Huai Opera before and after liberation. Xiao Wenyan said that before liberation, Huai Opera performers lived like beasts of burden, performing two shows a day and still not getting enough to eat. Some actors even had to pull rickshaws in the morning. Even basic living was a problem, let alone artistic creation. After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the regime was in the hands of the people, and the artistic undertaking also gained status. Many actors were originally illiterate. Under the Party's education, they learned culture, could read scripts, read newspapers, and write simple articles. Under the Party's policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new," Huai Opera has also developed and improved rapidly. Many old operas have been reorganized, and many new operas have also been created. These achievements are obvious to all. Actors are not only stable in their lives, but their political status has also been improved. They not only perform, but also participate in the management of national affairs. She herself was elected as a representative of the Shanghai People's Congress.

Yue Opera actress Ding Saijun refuted the Rightists' fallacy of slandering the "Communist Party's suppression of talent." She said: The Rightists believe that the Communist Party does not know how to use talent and wastes talent, which is completely slander. In fact, the Communist Party is best at using talent. Taking the Yue Opera Theater as an example, Yuan Xuefen, Fan Ruijuan, Fu Quanxiang, Xu Yulan, and Wang Wenjuan are not only actors, but also representatives of the People's Congress or members of the CPPCC, and are also being used as talents for managing national affairs. In terms of art, the actors in our troupe have been to the front lines of national defense, to factories and villages, and have performed in the Soviet Union and East Germany to strengthen international friendly cooperation, and have also been to the Korean battlefield. This shows that our current artistic talents are being fully utilized. This has never happened in any previous dynasty.

The Rightists said: Since liberation, the Party has not cultivated young actors. Jin Caifeng, representing a dozen young actors from the Yue Opera Theater, said: This is complete nonsense. She said: In the old society, the only way to become an actor was to become an apprentice, suffer a lot from the boss, and not necessarily become an actor. After liberation, the learning conditions for young actors were fundamentally improved under the care of the Party. The Party organization of the Yue Opera Theater teaches young people to study culture, invites vocal teachers to train young people's voices, and also invites teachers to coach their skills. The lives of young actors are also much better than before liberation. Have young actors been cultivated since liberation? I am an example myself. Before liberation, I ran errands for several years and couldn't even do the most basic movements such as "somersault." After liberation, I joined the national theater, and the leaders constantly educated and cultivated me. I learned how to use traditional performing techniques. In martial arts, I also went from someone who couldn't even do a "somersault" to someone who could play the role of a martial arts actress. Take Lü Ruoying, for example. She spent nearly ten years of her sixteen-year stage life in the old society, and didn't get any development, but contracted lung disease. After liberation, the Party cured her lung disease. In just six or seven years, she has become a young actress with considerable achievements.

Many other people spoke at the debate. The exposed Rightists in the literary and art circles also participated in the conference. In the face of ironclad facts, they did not dare to stand up and defend their reactionary words and deeds. This meeting will continue to be held.

### 文化艺术之花欣欣向荣  上海文化艺术工作者在辩论会上粉碎右派谬论

    文化艺术之花欣欣向荣
    上海文化艺术工作者在辩论会上粉碎右派谬论
    本报上海15日电  上海一千多个文化艺术工作者在前、昨两日举行大规模的反右派辩论会，用事实与右派谬论展开论战，辩论的中心是：“解放以后，上海的文化艺术事业的成绩是不是主要的？是不是一团糟？”“党能不能领导艺术事业？”等问题。
    上海人民图书馆编目部主任陈石铭以他解放前后的切身经历，驳斥了右派分子诬蔑“新中国图书馆事业也是一团糟”的谰言。他说：解放前全上海只有一个公共图书馆，全部藏书中文约有九万册，西文有两万册，图书馆的经费少得可怜，到1948年上半年，它的全部办公费和事业费仅够应付每月的水电开支。解放后的短短几年中，我馆的工作人员增加了四倍，藏书增加了八倍，读者增加了二十倍到三十倍。这同反动统治时期真是不可同日而语。不仅如此，解放后图书馆的服务对象也有很大的改变，过去工农读者绝无仅有，现在最多时工人读者占30％以上。
    上海人民艺术剧院艺委会秘书杨英梧，用解放后话剧事业空前繁荣的实例，有力的揭穿了右派分子向人民话剧事业泼污水的阴谋。杨英梧说：从全国范围来看，解放后建立了话剧团和话剧院共六十一个，民营公助的话剧团五十二个。全国工厂农村的业余剧团，据1955年上半年估计，即达十万个，人数约三百万人。这样壮大的话剧队伍是我国有史以来从未有过的。以“上海人艺”来说，虽然工作上存在着不少缺点，但它取得的成绩也不能一笔抹杀。与解放前相比，“人艺”的前身是“演剧九队”，它在1937年到1948年的十一年中，总共不过演出了七百八十六场，而“人艺”在1955年到1956年两年中就演出了八百二十三场。“演剧九队”从1944年到1948年的五年间，观众共二十一万五千多人，而“人艺”今年上半年的观众人数即超过了九队五年观众的总数。解放以来，人艺的工作是在不断进展的，右派分子说“人艺”的工作每况愈下，这完全是中伤。
    著名歌唱家周小燕在会上说，被称为中国音乐摇篮的上海，解放前却只有一个交响乐团，而且指挥和演奏员绝大部分是外国人。办了二十二年的上海音乐专科学校，解放时只有七十四个学生。现在，上海有了交响乐团、歌舞团、民族管弦乐团、管乐团、合唱团和实验歌剧院六个专业音乐、歌舞团体。设在上海的音乐学院的学生有三百人，钢琴、唱片、图书等设备比当时的音专多十倍，还设立了附属中学和儿童音乐学校。这几年音乐学院培养了许多出色的音乐人材，有不少人在国际比赛中获得了荣誉。
    人民淮剧团演员筱文艳以淮剧在解放前后的不同遭遇，有力地驳斥右派分子说党不能领导艺术事业的谬论。筱文艳说，解放前淮剧艺人过的是牛马生活，一天演出两场，还不得一饱，有些演员上午还要出去拉黄包车。起码的生活都成问题，谈不上什么艺术创造。解放后，在共产党的领导下，政权掌握在人民的手里，艺术事业也有了地位。本来有许多演员一字不识，在党的教育下，学了文化，能读剧本、看报纸、写简单的文章了。在党的“百花齐放，推陈出新”的方针下，淮剧也有了迅速的发展和提高，整理了许多老戏，也创作了不少新戏，这些成就是有目共睹的。演员不仅在生活上安定了，政治地位也提高了，不仅演戏，而且参加了国家大事的管理。她自己就被选为上海市人民代表。
    越剧演员丁赛君就右派分子污蔑“共产党积压人才”的谬论进行了驳斥。她说：右派分子认为共产党不会使用人才，糟踏人才，这完全是污蔑。事实上共产党最会使用人才，以越剧院来说，袁雪芬、范瑞娟、傅全香、徐玉兰、王文娟，这些同志不仅是演员，而且是人民代表或政协委员，同时作为管理国家大事的人才在使用着。在艺术上，我们团里的演员去过国防前线，下过工厂、农村，去苏联、民主德国做过加强国际友好合作的演出，也去过朝鲜战场，这说明我们现在的艺术人才是在充分使用着。这是那个朝代也没有过的事。
    右派分子说：解放以来党对青年演员没有什么培养。金采凤代表越剧院十几个青年演员说：这完全是胡说。她说：在旧社会要做一个演员，唯一办法就是当徒弟，吃了老板许多苦，还不一定能成一个演员。解放后在党的关怀下，青年演员的学习条件才根本改善了。越剧院的党组织教青年人学习文化，请声乐教师训练青年人的嗓音，还请了老师教练功。青年演员的生活也比解放前好多了。解放后有没有培养出青年演员呢？我自己就是个例子，解放前我跑了几年龙套，连“鹞子翻身”等最普通动作都不会。解放后我参加了国家剧团，领导上不断教育培养我，我才懂得如何运用传统的表演手法，在武戏上也从连“鹞子翻身”都不会的人，锻炼成为能演武花旦的角色了。拿呂瑞英说，她十六年舞台生活，有近十年是在旧社会中过的，没得到什么发展，却得了肺病，解放后党为她治了肺病，短短六七年，已成为一个有相当成绩的青年演员。
    辩论会上还有不少人发了言。被揭露的文艺界右派分子也参加了大会，在铁一般的事实面前，他们没有敢站出来为自己的反动言行辩护。这个会还要继续举行。
