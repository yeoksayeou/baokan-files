　　Saving Where Possible
　  Hebei Construction Units Further Reduce Investment by 20 Million Yuan
    Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, August 22nd. One hundred and eighty-one capital construction units in Hebei Province have recently re-examined their construction projects for this year and made reasonable arrangements. According to preliminary statistics from early August, this review and arrangement can save the state over 20 million yuan in construction investment.

    A considerable portion of the projects that have been decided to be reduced or postponed can be resolved through organized collaboration. The Kailuan Coal Mine originally planned to build a locomotive and freight car repair shop this year. However, after investigation, it was found that the existing equipment capacity of the Tangshan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory could guarantee the timely repair of the locomotives and freight cars of the Kailuan Coal Mine. Therefore, after research and consultation between the two parties, the Kailuan Coal Mine reduced this construction project, which can save more than 270,000 yuan in construction investment. Many units, based on the principle of not affecting production quality, have tried their best to reduce the degree of mechanization and make full use of old equipment, which has also solved many problems. The Xuanhua Iron and Steel Plant originally planned to use fully mechanized equipment. After inspection, it was found that the plant's use of semi-mechanized equipment was completely suitable for production needs. Therefore, it was decided to change the fully mechanized equipment to semi-mechanized equipment. This will not only save a large amount of investment, but more importantly, it will solve the current difficulty in equipment supply, and it will also enable more workers to be employed without affecting production capacity. In addition, some units have mobilized engineering and technical personnel to modify the original design and reduce unnecessary decoration. Engineering and technical personnel of the Shijiazhuang Vegetable Company changed the planned asphalt pavement to gravel pavement, reducing the cost per square meter from 20 yuan to 4.5 yuan. The Kailuan Coal Science Research Institute's office building project also saved more than 60,000 yuan in investment after changing the originally planned fancy lamps and road lights to ordinary lamps, steel wire beds to wooden beds, and eliminating some artificial stones and exterior wall paint and other decorations.

　　能节省的尽量节省
　  河北基建单位又削减两千万元投资
    据新华社保定22日电　河北省一百八十一个基本建设单位，最近再次审查了今年的建设项目，并且作了合理安排。据8月上旬初步统计，经过这次审查和安排，可以给国家节约两千多万元的建设投资。
    这次决定削减和缓建的项目中，有相当一部分是可以通过组织协作来解决问题的。开滦煤矿原计划今年建设一个机车货车修理厂，后来经过调查，唐山机车车辆修理工厂现有设备能力能够保证开滦煤矿机车货车的及时修理，于是在双方研究协商后，开滦煤矿就削减了这个建设项目，可以节省建设投资二十七万多元。许多单位根据不影响生产质量的原则，尽量降低机械化程度，充分利用旧有设备，也解决了很多问题。宣化炼铁厂原设计要采用全部机械化设备，经过检查，发现这个厂采用半机械化设备是完全适合生产需要的，于是决定把全部机械化设备改为半机械化设备。这样，不但能够节约一大笔投资，更重要的是解决了目前设备供应的困难，还能够多使一些工人就业，生产能力也不受影响。另外，还有些单位发动工程技术人员修改原来设计，削减了不必要的装饰。石家庄蔬菜公司工程技术人员把计划修建的沥青路面改为碎石路面，每平方公尺造价就由二十元降低为四元五角。开滦煤炭科学研究院办公楼工程，将原计划的花练灯、路透灯改为普通灯，钢丝床改为木床，并取消了部分假石、外墙刷油漆等装饰以后，也节约投资六万多元。
