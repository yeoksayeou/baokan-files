Xinhua News Agency, 7th Dispatch: Shanxi Agricultural College recently held a very lively anti-rightist debate, where people adhered to reasoned struggle, refuting the rightist element Zhao Qinghe to the point of exhaustion and exposing his true colors.

Zhao Qinghe was a lecturer at Shanxi Agricultural College. In order to attack the Party, he insisted that "farmers' lives have not improved," "rural areas are as poor as in the past," and "collectivization has not increased production."

At the debate, the gray-haired old professor Jia Linhou cited detailed and precise statistics to refute Zhao Qinghe's fallacies. He said that 1956 was the first year of advanced collectivization in Shanxi Province. Although the province suffered a major natural disaster, the total grain output still reached 8.67 billion jin. After paying agricultural taxes to the state, selling 2.1 billion jin of surplus grain, and setting aside seeds and feed, farmers averaged 432 jin net per person. Then, Jia Linhou compared this figure with the pre-war period. He said that 1936 was the best year for harvests in Shanxi Province before liberation, with a total grain output of only 6.7 billion jin. However, each farmer could only get an average of 240 jin after paying rent. The grain obtained per person was 192 jin less than last year. These two figures are enough to show that collectivization has increased production and improved farmers' lives.

In the face of such conclusive facts, the rightist element Zhao Qinghe burst into abuse, saying that "statistical figures lack authenticity" and "who knows how they were fabricated." His remarks aroused widespread anger.

At this time, the farmer representative from the Guanjabao Township Agricultural Cooperative in Taigu County, Yuan Zigong, who had come to participate in the struggle meeting, spoke up. He told people that in the last few years of Yan Xishan's dark rule alone, in the Gouze natural village where he lived, out of 119 households, more than half of the families did not have enough food to eat every year, and 24 farmers starved to death one winter. However, after advanced collectivization last year, the entire cooperative distributed an average of 441 jin of grain per person, plus an average of 105 yuan in cash per person, not including household sideline income. Regarding the unit area yield of grain, the average yield per mu of this cooperative was 280 jin in 1955. After turning into an advanced cooperative last year, the average yield per mu was 361 jin. Yuan Zigong questioned Zhao Qinghe face-to-face, saying, "If you harvest 81 more jin per mu, would you say this isn't an improvement?"

The rightist element Zhao Qinghe still disagreed with Yuan Zigong's speech, shamelessly saying that "the Guanjabao Township Cooperative is the only model that the Communist Party can come up with in Taigu County." "This is the Communist Party pretending to be fat by slapping its face, deliberately showing the Guanjabao Cooperative to me, Zhao Qinghe."

Assistant Teacher Wu Bingchang then spoke, citing the example of an ordinary agricultural cooperative (Houcheng Dongsheng Cooperative) that he had investigated to refute Zhao Qinghe's nonsense. He said that the Houcheng Dongsheng Cooperative, after deducting all expenses last year, distributed an average of 450 jin of grain per person, which was even more than the income of the members of the Guanjabao Agricultural Cooperative. After describing in detail the income and expenditure of the members and the improvement of their lives, he further questioned Zhao Qinghe: What is your basis for saying that farmers' lives have not improved? Who provided the material?

Under the circumstances where everyone was pointing fingers at him, the rightist element Zhao Qinghe was speechless, unable to deny it, and had to admit that the material he based his arguments on was hearsay, that he merely "heard it from a neighbor when he went home," and that this neighbor "was a landlord who was struggled against during the land reform."

Under continued questioning, Zhao Qinghe confessed that he fabricated these non-existent facts to shoot poisoned arrows at the Party and the people because he hated the socialist system and the Communist Party. He fantasized about capitalist restoration, so "after the Hungarian incident occurred," he "could not suppress it any longer." In this way, the conspiracy of the rightist element Zhao Qinghe was completely exposed.

    驳得右派分子哑口无言
    山西农学院坚持说理的一大胜利
    赵庆贺不得不承认他散布的谬论是无中生有，因为他仇视社会主义制度妄想资本主义复辟
    据新华社7日讯　山西农学院日前举行了一次非常生动的反右派辩论大会，人们在会上坚持说理斗争，驳得右派分子赵庆贺理屈词穷，原形毕露。
    赵庆贺是山西农学院讲师，他为了攻击党，硬说“农民生活没有改善”，“农村和过去一样贫困”，“合作化没有提高产量”。
    在辩论会上头发花白的老教授贾麟厚举出一些详细而确切的统计数字来驳斥赵庆贺的谬论。他说，1956年是山西省高级合作化的第一年，全省虽遭受较大的自然灾害，但粮食总产量仍达到八十六亿七千多万斤，除去向国家交纳公粮、出售余粮二十一亿斤和留下种子、饲料外，农民每人平均净得四百三十二斤。接着贾麟厚又把这个数目字与抗战前对比一下。他说，1936年是解放前山西省收成最好的一年，粮食总产量只有六十七亿斤。而每个农民除过交纳地租平均只能得到二百四十斤。每人所得粮食，比去年少一百九十二斤。这两个数字足够说明合作化提高了生产，改善了农民生活。
    在这样确凿的事实面前，右派分子赵庆贺竟破口大骂，说“统计数字缺乏真实性”，“还不知道怎么捏弄出来的”。他的发言，引起了人们普遍的愤怒。
    这时，赶来参加斗争会的农民代表、太谷县贯家堡乡农业社主任员子恭说话了。他告诉人们：仅在阎锡山黑暗统治时的后期几年，他所居住的沟则自然村，一百一十九户人家，每年总有半数还多的人家粮食不够吃，有一年冬天就饿死二十四个农民。可是去年高级合作化后，全合作社每人平均就分到粮食四百四十一斤，另外每人平均还分现金一百零五元，这还不包括家庭副业收入。关于粮食单位面积产量，1955年这个社平均亩产量为二百八十斤，去年转为高级合作社后，每亩平均产三百六十一斤。员子恭当面质问赵庆贺说：“一亩地多收了八十一斤，你说这叫不叫提高？”
    右派分子赵庆贺仍不同意员子恭的发言，他无耻地说什么“贯家堡乡合作社是共产党在太谷县唯一能够拿出的典型”。“这是共产党打肿脸充胖子，故意拿贯家堡社给我赵庆贺看罢了”。
    助教吴秉昌接着发言，他举出他曾经调查过的一个普通农业社（候城东升社）的事例，来驳斥赵庆贺的胡言乱语。他说，候城东升社去年除去一切开支，全社平均每人净分得粮食四百五十斤，比贯家堡农业社社员的收入还多。他详细叙述了社员们的收支状况和生活改善情况后，进一步质问赵庆贺：你说农民生活没有改善，有什么根据？是谁提供的材料？
    右派分子赵庆贺在千夫所指的情势下，理屈词穷，无法抵赖，只得承认他所根据的材料是道听途说，他仅仅是“回家时听一位邻家说的”，而这位邻人“是土改时被斗争的地主”。
    在人们继续追问下，赵庆贺交代出他捏造这些无中生有的事实，向党和人民发射毒箭，是因为他仇视社会主义制度，仇恨共产党。他妄想资本主义复辟，因此，“匈牙利事件发生后”，他“压抑不住了”。就这样，右派分子赵庆贺的阴谋就被全部揭穿了。
