Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, August 20th: A hydrological resources exploration team is drilling in the area of Muchuan County, Sichuan Province, where the Dadu River and the Mabian River are closest to each other.

According to engineers, they want to understand the hydrogeological conditions of this area in order to determine whether it is possible to excavate a seven-kilometer-long tunnel to divert the Dadu River water, which has an average annual flow of 1,570 cubic meters per second, to the Mabian River. If the water diversion is successful, its natural drop of eighty meters can be used to generate electricity, and the possible power generation will reach 1.5 million kilowatts.

　  把大渡河水引向马边河
    据新华社成都20日电　一支水力资源勘查队伍，正在四川省沐川县境内的大渡河和马边河两河相距最近的地方进行钻探。
    据工程师们说，他们要了解这一地区的水文地质情况，以便确定是否有可能开挖一条七公里长的隧道，把多年平均流量为一千五百七十秒公方的大渡河水引向马边河。如果引水成功，就可以利用它的八十公尺的天然落差来发电，发电可能出力将达到一百五十万瓩。
