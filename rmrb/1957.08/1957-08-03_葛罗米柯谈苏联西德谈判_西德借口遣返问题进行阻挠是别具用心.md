Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 1st: Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko stated that the West German government delegation's raising of the so-called repatriation of German citizens during negotiations with the Soviet government delegation is completely unfounded. He said that in order to improve relations between the two countries, West Germany should stop the propaganda and clamor surrounding this issue.

Gromyko, at the request of Mr. Lahr, the head of the West German government delegation currently negotiating in Moscow, received him on July 31 and discussed issues related to the negotiations between the two government delegations. The above statement was made during this conversation.

Gromyko stated that during the talks between the two government delegations, it was discovered that the delegation of the Federal Republic of Germany deliberately placed the fabricated issue of the so-called repatriation of Germans from the Soviet Union in a primary position and tried its best to make this issue the focus of the talks. However, as everyone knows, the Soviet government made it very clear in the exchange of notes before the talks that the work of repatriating German citizens from the Soviet Union had been completed.

Gromyko pointed out: "The West German government delegation's raising of the repatriation issue in this Moscow negotiation can only prove that West Germany is unwilling to improve relations between our two countries, and regrettably, it has other intentions. If one pays attention to the parliamentary elections that the Federal Republic of Germany will hold in September this year, it is not difficult to see the nature of these intentions."

He emphasized, "The Soviet government advocates improving relations with the Federal Republic of Germany in reality. In order to improve relations between the two countries, we should first develop trade, scientific, technological, and cultural ties, and also stop the propaganda and clamor surrounding the artificial so-called repatriation issue."

At the end of the conversation, Mr. Lahr said that he would return to Bonn to report to his government on the progress of the negotiations between the two government delegations.

    葛罗米柯谈苏联西德谈判
    西德借口遣返问题进行阻挠是别具用心
    据新华社1日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联外交部长葛罗米柯声明说，西德政府代表团在同苏联政府代表团谈判当中提出所谓遣返德国公民的问题是没有任何根据的。他说，为了改善两国的关系，西德方面应该停止围绕着这个问题所进行的宣传和叫嚣。
    葛罗米柯应目前正在莫斯科进行谈判的西德政府代表团团长拉尔的请求，在7月31日接见了他，并且同他就两国政府代表团谈判的有关问题进行了交谈。上面的声明就是在这次交谈中发表的。
    葛罗米柯在声明中说，在两国政府代表团的会谈过程中发现，德意志联邦共和国代表团故意把所谓从苏联遣返德国人这样一个杜撰出来的问题提到首要地位，并且竭力企图把这个问题作为会谈的中心内容。可是，大家知道，苏联政府在会谈前交换照会时就十分明确地阐明，从苏联遣返德国公民回国的工作已经全部结束。
    葛罗米柯指出：西德政府代表团在“这次莫斯科谈判中提出遣返问题，这只能证明西德方面不愿意改善我们两国的关系，而且很遗憾，它另有打算。如果注意一下今年9月德意志联邦共和国将举行议会选举的话，就不难识破这种打算的性质了。”
    他强调说，“苏联政府主张在事实上改善同德意志联邦共和国的关系。为了改善两国的关系，首先应当发展贸易和科学、技术、文化联系，而且还应该停止围绕着人为的所谓遣返问题进行宣传叫嚣”。
    在这次谈话结束的时候，拉尔先生说，他将回波恩向他的政府报告两国政府代表团谈判的进行情况。
