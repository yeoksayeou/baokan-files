Liang Sicheng said in his speech that rightist Luo Longji is a despicable politician who, like Chiang Kai-shek, "responds to all changes with invariability." What is his "invariability"? It is to "consistently" oppose the Soviet Union, oppose the Communist Party, oppose the proletarian dictatorship, and oppose socialism.

Luo Longji Yearned for the Birth of a "Mussolini" in China

As early as 1929, Luo Longji published two articles in the "New Moon" magazine: "My 'Unreserved Criticism' of Party Affairs (Kuomintang)" and "What Kind of Political System Do We Want?" He viciously described the proletarian dictatorship as a one-party dictatorship, saying that the first to experiment with one-party dictatorship was the Russian Communist Party. What was especially sinister was that he compared the Soviet Communist Party with the Italian Fascist Party.

Luo Longji was particularly interested in the British and American political systems, saying: If Chinese political parties truly emulate the British and American style of politics,... they can "elevate China to the realm of freedom and equality, and lead the people to a life of peace and prosperity"... Although he said in his "Preliminary Confession" that he had "consistently followed the third road," he believed that: Unfortunately, China does not have a person like Mussolini; China is a "country where Mussolini has not yet been born." Therefore, it is temporarily taking the British and American path, waiting for the birth of Mussolini. Who is the "unborn" Mussolini that Luo Longji is looking forward to? It seems it might be himself!

Luo Longji is the Founder of the Reactionary Theory of "Party Rule"

A common characteristic of rightists is to use the tricks of bourgeois rogue lawyers, quibbling over words and denying facts outright. Here I want to point out that Luo Longji repeatedly quibbled at the rectification symposium of the China Democratic League, saying that his anti-Party remarks and Chu Anping's remarks about "Party Rule" were irrelevant, as if this could prove his innocence. In fact, the founder of "Party Rule" is Luo Longji.

As early as 1929, Luo Longji slandered and distorted the Communist Party and Marxism. He vilified the most important key of Marxism, the proletarian dictatorship, as "one-party dictatorship" and "the Party above the state." He called the theory that the state will also wither away with the elimination of classes "using the Party to abolish the state." He admitted that the state is a tool, but said, "Why must the state necessarily be a tool of the bourgeoisie?" attempting to blur people's class consciousness. On the other hand, he also said: "The Kuomintang can copy the Communist Party's tactics and put the Party above the state. Why can't other parties copy the Kuomintang's articles and put the Party above the state? Qin Shi Huang, Liu Bang, Cao Cao, Sima Yi... after conquering the world, of course, become emperors. This is the story of 'Family Rule'. After the Kuomintang revolution succeeds, it can be said: 'The Party is above the state'. Of course, other parties can also say 'The Party is above the state' when their revolution succeeds." This, of course, becomes a continuous "Party Rule". Finally, he added a few words saying: "The Communist Party does not need to worry about this criticism. The collapse of the state is originally the Communist Party's hope. Seeking benevolence and obtaining benevolence, what is there to complain about?" Of course, the ultimate elimination of the state in a classless society is the long-term goal of communism, but thirty years ago, when the broad masses of the Chinese people and intellectuals did not yet have a correct understanding of the Communist Party and communism, Luo Longji seized upon the national consciousness cultivated under the leadership of the Communist Party at that time and viciously used phrases such as "the collapse of the state," or said that "The Communist Party joined the Kuomintang in those days... with a purpose and plan... to achieve the Communist Party's goal of 'using the Party to abolish the state,'" to wantonly slander and uglify the Communist Party.

Twenty-eight years ago, Luo Longji used the three words "Party Rule" to appeal to the public, but now he flatly denies that he had seen Chu Anping's draft speech on "Party Rule." This kind of technical quibbling is irrelevant. The problem lies in the essence. The problem is that today's Luo Longji and the Luo Longji of thirty years ago are essentially no different. Therefore, a sentence from Luo Longji thirty years ago can still be replayed today through a system of Luo Longji—Pu Xixiu—Wenhui Bao—Chu Anping. The reason is Luo Longji's "invariability," his consistent anti-Soviet, anti-Communist, and anti-socialist stance.

### 梁思成说罗隆基和蒋介石一样是“以不变应万变”的卑鄙政客

    梁思成说罗隆基和蒋介石一样是“以不变应万变”的卑鄙政客
    梁思成发言说，右派分子罗隆基是一个同蒋介石一样“以不变应万变”的卑鄙政客。他的“不变”是什么？就是“贯彻始终”地反对苏联，反对共产党，反对无产阶级专政，反对社会主义。
    罗隆基向往着“墨索里尼”在中国诞生
    远在1929年，罗隆基在“新月”杂志上曾发表了“我对党务（国民党）上的‘尽情批评’”和“我们要什么样的政治制度”两篇文章。他狠毒地把无产阶级专政说成是一党独裁，他说第一个试验一党独裁的是俄国共产党。尤其险恶的是他把苏联共产党和意大利法西斯党相提并论。
    罗隆基对英美政治制度特别感到兴趣，他说：中国的政党若真效法英美式的政治，……可以“跻中国于自由平等之域，致人民于安居乐业之途”……尽管他在他的“初步交代”中说自己“一贯走第三条路线”，但是他认为：不幸，中国没有墨索里尼这样一个人，中国是一个“墨索里尼未生的国家”。因此才暂时走英美的路，以等待墨索里尼的诞生。罗隆基期待是那一个“未生”的墨索里尼呢？看来也许就是他自己吧！
    罗隆基是“党天下”反动理论的创始人
    右派分子的一个共性就是用资产阶级流氓律师的手腕，咬文嚼字地在事实面前矢口抵赖。在这里我要指出罗隆基在民盟整风座谈会上再三地狡辩，说他和储安平“党天下”的反党发言怎样怎样无关，好像这样就可以证明他无罪，其实“党天下”的创始人正是罗隆基。
    远在1929年，罗隆基就诬蔑、歪曲共产党和马克思主义。他把马克思主义的最主要关键无产阶级专政诬蔑为“一党独裁”、“党在国上”。他把随着阶级的消灭，国家也将消灭的理论叫做“以党废国”。他承认国家是工具，但说“国家何尝一定是资产阶级的工具”，想这样来模糊人们的阶级意识。在另一方面他又说：“国民党可以抄写共产党的策略，把党放在国上，别的党又何尝不可抄国民党的文章，把党放在国上，秦始皇、刘邦、曹操、司马懿………打到了天下，当然做皇帝。这就是“家天下”的故事。国民党革命成功，可以说：“党在国上”，其他的党革命成功，当然亦可以说“党在国上”。这当然成了继续不断的，“党天下”。最后他还加上几句说：“这种批评，共产党不必顾虑。国的崩溃，本来是共产党的希望。求仁得仁，抑又何怨？”当然，在没有阶级的社会里最后消灭国家是共产主义的远景目标，但在三十年前，当中国广大群众和知识分子对共产党、共产主义还没有正确认识的时候，罗隆基却抓住当时在共产党领导下培养起来的民族意识，恶毒地用“国的崩溃”一类的词句，或者说什么“共产党当日加入国民党，……是有作用有计划的。……以达共产党，‘以党废国’的目的，”来向共产党肆意诬蔑，丑化共产党。
    二十八年以前罗隆基就以“党天下”三个字来哗众取宠，现在他却矢口抵赖储安平“党天下”的发言稿他没有看过。这种技术性的狡辩是不相干的。问题在于本质。问题在今天的罗隆基和三十年前的罗隆基在本质上没什么分别，所以罗隆基三十年前的一句话到今天还能通过罗隆基—浦熙修—文汇报—储安平这样一个系统再度重播出来。其原因就是罗隆基的“不变”，一贯的反苏，反共，反社会主义的立场。
