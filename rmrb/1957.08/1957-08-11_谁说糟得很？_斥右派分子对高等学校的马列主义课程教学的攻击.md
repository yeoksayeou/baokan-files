Who Says It's Terrible?
    -- A Rebuttal to Rightists' Attacks on the Teaching of Marxism-Leninism Courses in Universities
    Ā Jīn
    During the rectification movement, a vigorous ideological and political struggle unfolded in universities across the country. As the forefront of the working class's ideological position, the Marxism-Leninism courses were naturally not immune. The bourgeois rightists, seeing certain shortcomings in the teaching of Marxism-Leninism courses, and noting the dissatisfaction of some students with the teaching of Marxism-Leninism courses, as well as their tendency to not value Marxism-Leninism courses, felt they had an opportunity to exploit. They seized upon various reasons and adopted various means to attack the shortcomings in the teaching of Marxism-Leninism courses, strike at the morale of Marxism-Leninism teachers, and openly advocate for the cancellation of compulsory Marxism-Leninism courses or their conversion to electives. They claimed that the teaching quality of Marxism-Leninism courses was very low, that the teaching achievements of the past few years were minimal, and that there was serious dogmatism in the teaching, portraying the teaching of Marxism-Leninism courses as a complete mess, in order to achieve the goal of canceling or weakening the teaching of Marxism-Leninism courses.

    The inclusion of Marxism-Leninism in the curriculum is one of the signs that Chinese higher education has entered a new historical stage.

    Rightist gentlemen, your insistence that the teaching quality of Marxism-Leninism courses in universities is very low and that the teaching achievements of the past few years are minimal is unfounded. To judge the value and quality of a work, one must first consider from what standpoint and viewpoint one is starting? What criteria are used to measure it? We deeply feel that in the long years before the national liberation, under the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, Chinese universities never dreamed of being able to openly preach the truth of Marxism in the lecture hall. In those days, countless revolutionaries and progressive youth who studied Marxist theory and promoted Marxist thought were thrown into prison and killed! It was also very difficult to find a book on Marxism-Leninism. Those who pursued the truth would treasure a small booklet as if they had found a precious treasure. Everyone read it secretly, passed it on in secret, taking great risks. Today, all universities across the country have included Marxism-Leninism courses as an important part of the teaching content, and all universities have established Marxism-Leninism teaching and research sections to lead the teaching of Marxism-Leninism courses. Students can freely listen to lectures in the classroom, take notes, hold discussion sessions, and study Marxism-Leninism courses under the guidance of teachers. There are many classic works in the library. Anyone who is willing to learn can learn as much as they want. In our view, this change in universities is an earth-shaking change. The inclusion of Marxism-Leninism in the curriculum is a great historical event worthy of rejoicing, and an important symbol of Chinese higher education entering the historical stage of serving the people. However, in your eyes, rightist elements, it is of course a completely different matter.

    After liberation, although there was an urgent demand for the establishment of Marxism-Leninism courses in universities across the country, the development of the entire work had to go through a difficult creative process from scratch. Universities have a group of old teachers for mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology... and other courses, and there are certain ready-made conditions such as courses, teaching materials, and equipment. However, Marxism-Leninism courses had nothing, and needed to be built from the ground up, starting from scratch. The most important issue was the lack of teachers, and Marxism-Leninism teachers in universities could not be trained in a short period of time. Therefore, in the early days of liberation, general universities could only adopt the method of inviting comrades with a high level of Marxism-Leninism to give large reports to conduct Marxism-Leninism education for teachers and students. Although the curriculum of many schools had Marxism-Leninism courses, most could not attend classes in the normal way. In the autumn of 1952, the Party and the government began to use accelerated methods to train Marxism-Leninism teachers on a large scale. Generally, university graduates or young teaching assistants were selected, given one to two years of training, and then went to universities to teach or serve as teaching assistants. With the growth of the teaching staff, universities were able to gradually offer courses such as the fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism, the history of the Chinese revolution, political economy, and dialectical and historical materialism according to the teaching plan. Now, a contingent of more than 4,300 Marxism-Leninism teachers has been formed in universities across the country, and more than 400,000 university students across the country have been able to study Marxism-Leninism courses under the guidance of teachers. All universities have established Marxism-Leninism course teaching and research sections, and have a set of usable teaching plans, teaching outlines, and teaching materials. The creation process of Marxism-Leninism courses in universities has largely come to an end, laying the foundation for continuous improvement of teaching quality in the future. Compared with the situation in the early days of the founding of the country, the progress is significant. Party and government leading organs and universities have done a lot of work in this regard. This is a fact that is obvious to all.

    Marxism-Leninism courses in universities have only a short history of a few years, and are several young courses. Up to now, there are still very few professors and associate professors among the teachers, accounting for about 5% of the total number of teachers, while young lecturers and teaching assistants account for about 95%. The average age of teachers in many teaching and research sections is only 25 or 26 years old, and many young teaching assistants are also teaching courses. Generally, young teachers have only received one or two years of professional training, but the teaching tasks they undertake are very heavy. It is this young team that has shouldered the task of Marxism-Leninism teaching for hundreds of thousands of university students. Of course, young teachers are not experienced when they start teaching, but generally after two or three years of practical training, the teaching quality has improved significantly. Some young teachers teach as well as old teachers and are welcomed by students. The vast majority of young teachers work and study very hard, and have done their best in teaching. Young teachers cannot become mature old professors in all aspects overnight, but can only improve step by step in work and study. Because they study diligently, their progress is rapid. We firmly believe that their teaching work will be done better year by year, and a large number of excellent teachers will emerge among them, gradually forming a strong theoretical team. But some people just don't see their achievements, unrealistically put forward excessive demands, and point fingers to blame them. Can it be said to be fair? Rightist gentlemen! In your eyes, it is "terrible," but in our view, it is "very good"!

    Many comrades who are truly concerned about higher education have also pointed out the shortcomings and errors existing in the teaching of Marxism-Leninism courses, and the teachers are not complacent about the current teaching situation. There are many important issues in teaching that need to be seriously studied and resolved. But this has nothing in common with the malicious attacks of the rightist gentlemen. Everyone's criticism is to strengthen the teaching of these courses, not to cancel or weaken them; it is to care for and help these teachers, not to attack them. On this point, we have no common language with the rightist gentlemen who are hostile to socialism.

    You don't need any real Marxism-Leninism, but you are opposing Marxism-Leninism under the guise of opposing dogmatism.

    "You recite from the book, and there is serious dogmatism in your teaching." The rightist gentlemen put on the air of 100% Bolsheviks and attacked the teaching of Marxism-Leninism courses from another aspect. We admit that there are indeed dogmatic habits in the teaching of Marxism-Leninism courses in universities. We have criticized them and we must resolutely overcome them. But, may I ask, what is the standpoint and viewpoint of you rightist gentlemen when you oppose dogmatism? What kind of result do you intend to achieve by opposing it? To be honest, you don't need any real Marxism-Leninism, but you are opposing Marxism-Leninism under the guise of opposing dogmatism. In your view, Marxism-Leninism is dogmatism. You are opposing dogmatism from the right. On the point of opposing dogmatism, we must first draw a clear line with you. If you are happy, you can oppose yours. That is completely another matter. True Marxists resolutely oppose dogmatism. We must improve teaching work in universities in accordance with the principle of linking theory with practice, arm young people with the ideological weapon of Marxism-Leninism, and educate them to gradually learn to fight against all kinds of anti-Marxist-Leninist ideological enemies, first and foremost to wage a resolute struggle against you bourgeois rightist elements.

    Rightist gentlemen, you often use the excuse of helping the Party to rectify its work, and the excuse of helping teachers to improve their teaching work, to obliterate the teaching achievements of Marxism-Leninism courses in order to achieve the shameful goal of opposing Marxism-Leninism and canceling or weakening Marxism-Leninism courses. This is your "help." Everyone knows that without the ideological leadership of Marxism-Leninism, there can be no victory in socialist construction. Without conducting Marxism-Leninism education for young students, it is impossible to cultivate talents who wholeheartedly serve socialist construction. Your attempt to overthrow the leadership of Marxism-Leninism ideologically and seize leadership from the working class is impossible. From the attitude towards Marxism-Leninism courses, it is not difficult to see your hideous anti-socialist faces. This matter once again reminds us that what you deeply hate is precisely what we must cherish; what you want to cancel and weaken is precisely what we should consolidate and strengthen. Your conspiracies and activities prompt us to make greater efforts to strengthen the teaching of Marxism-Leninism courses in universities and make it a combative course.

    谁说糟得很？
    ——斥右派分子对高等学校的马列主义课程教学的攻击
    阿金
    在整风运动当中，全国高等学校展开了轰轰烈烈的思想斗争和政治斗争，处在工人阶级思想阵地前沿的马列主义课程当然不会平静无事。资产阶级右派分子看到马列主义课程教学中的某些缺点，看到部分同学对马列主义课程教学有不满情绪和不重视马列主义课程的思想倾向，觉得有隙可乘，便借口种种理由，采取种种手段，攻击马列主义课程教学中的缺点，打击马列主义教师的情绪，公开主张取消公共必修的马列主义课程或改为选修。他们说马列主义课程的教学质量很低，几年来的教学成绩很小，教学中又存在着严重的教条主义，把马列主义课教学状况讲成一团糟，以达到取消或削弱马列主义课程的教学的目的。
    把马列主义列入教学计划，是中国高等教育走上新的历史阶段的标志之一。
    右派先生们，你们一口咬定高等学校的马列主义课程的教学质量很低，几年来教学成绩很小，是没有什么根据的。判断一件工作的价值大小和质量高低，首先要看你从什么立场、观点出发？用什么样的尺度来衡量？我们深切地体会到，在全国解放前的漫长的岁月里，处在帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义统治下的中国高等学校，做梦也想不到能够在讲堂上公开宣讲马克思主义的真理，当时学习马克思主义理论、宣传马克思主义思想的革命者和进步青年，被投进监狱、被杀害的真不知有多少！要找一本马列主义的著作也很不容易，追求真理的人们，偶然得到一本小册子就如获至宝，大家偷偷地阅读，暗中传递，担着很大的风险。今天，全国高等学校都把马列主义课程作为教学内容的重要组成部分，列入教学计划，各高等学校都建立了马列主义教研室，领导马列主义课程教学工作的进行。学生可以自由自在地在课堂上听讲，记笔记，开讨论会，在教师指导下学习马列主义课程。图书馆里有许多经典著作，只要谁愿意学习，谁便可以尽量地学习。在我们看来，高等学校中的这种变化，是天翻地覆的变化，把马列主义列入教学计划，是值得欢欣鼓舞的伟大的历史事件，是中国高等教育走上为人民服务的历史阶段的重要标志之一。但是，在你们右派分子看，当然完全是另外一回事情。
    解放以后，全国高等学校对开设马列主义课程虽然有着迫切的要求，但整个工作的发展必须经过一段从无到有的艰难缔造过程。高等学校的数学、物理、化学、生物……等课程，都有一批老教师，课程、教材、设备等也有一定的现成条件，可是马列主义课程却一无所有，需要平地起家，从头做起。最主要的问题，就是缺乏师资，而高等学校的马列主义教师又不是短时间内可以培养出来的。所以在解放初期，一般高等学校只能采取请马列主义水平较高的同志作大报告的办法，对师生进行马列主义教育。许多学校的课程表上虽然订有马列主义的课程，但多数无法按照正常的办法上课。1952年秋季党和政府开始采用速成的办法，大规模地培养马列主义师资，一般都是挑选高等学校毕业生或青年助教，给予一年到两年的训练，就到高等学校教课或担任教学辅导工作。随着教师队伍的成长，各高等学校才能逐步按照教学计划开设马列主义基础、中国革命史、政治经济学、辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义等课程。现在全国高等学校已经形成一支四千三百余人的马列主义教师队伍，全国四十多万高等学校学生都已能在教师指导下学习马列主义课程。各高等学校都建立了马列主义课程教研室，有了一套可用的教学计划、教学大纲和教材。高等学校马列主义课程的创设过程已大致告一段落，为今后不断提高教学质量打下了基础。今天的情况和开国初期比较起来，进步是显著的。党政领导机关和各高等学校在这一方面做了不少的工作。这是有目共睹的事实。
    高等学校马列主义课程只有短短的几年历史，是几门年青的课程。到目前为止，教师中的教授和副教授还很少，约占全体教师的5％，而青年讲师、助教却占95％左右，许多教研室教师的平均年龄仅二十五、六岁，青年助教开课的也很多，一般青年教师只受过一、二年的专业训练，所担负的教学任务却很繁重，就靠这支年轻的队伍把几十万大学生的马列主义教学任务担当起来的。青年教师在开始教课的时候，当然是不老练的，但一般经过两三年实际锻炼以后，教学质量就有了显著的提高。有些青年教师教得和老教师一样好，受到学生的欢迎。绝大多数青年教师的工作学习都很努力，在教学方面已经尽了他们应尽的力量。青年教师不可能在一个夜晚变成各方面都很成熟的老教授，只能在工作学习中一步一步地提高，由于他们刻苦钻研，他们的进步是迅速的，我们深信不疑，他们的教学工作将作得一年比一年好，他们当中一定会涌现出大批的优秀教师，逐渐形成一支坚强的理论队伍。可是偏偏有人看不到他们的劳绩，不切实际地提出过高的要求，指手划脚地责备他们，难道能说公平吗？右派先生们！在你们的眼里认为“糟得很”，在我们看来却是“好得很”！
    许多真正关心高等教育工作的同志，也曾指出马列主义课程教学中所存在着的缺点和错误，而教师们对于目前的教学状况也并没有自满自足，教学工作中有许多重要问题需要进行认真研究和解决。但是这和右派先生们的恶意攻击并无共同之点。大家的批评，是为了加强这几门课程的教学，而不是取消它、削弱它；是为了爱护和帮助这些教师，而不是打击他们。在这一点上，我们和敌视社会主义的右派先生们是没有共同语言的。
    你们并不需要什么真正的马列主义，不过是在反教条主义的幌子下反对马列主义罢了。
    “你们照本宣科，你们教学中有严重的教条主义”。右派先生们装出百分之百的布尔什维克的神气，从另一个方面来攻击马列主义课程的教学了。我们承认高等学校马列主义课程教学中确实存在教条主义习气，我们已经进行了批判，而且一定要坚决地克服它。但是，试问你们这些右派先生们是站在什么立场、用什么观点来反对教条主义的呢？你们打算反出一个什么结果呢？老实说，你们并不需要什么真正的马列主义，不过是在反教条主义的幌子下反对马列主义罢了。在你们看来，马列主义就是教条主义。你们是从右面来反对教条主义的。在反对教条主义这一点上，首先必须和你们划清界限，假使你们高兴，你们就去反你们的吧，那完全是另外一回事。真正的马克思主义者是坚决反对教条主义的，我们在高等学校中一定要按照理论联系实际方针改进教学工作，用马列主义的思想武器武装青年，教育他们逐渐学会和各类反马列主义的思想敌人作斗争，首先和你们这些资产阶级右派分子作坚决的斗争。
    右派先生们，你们常常借口帮助党整风，借口帮助教师改进教学工作，用抹煞马列主义课程的教学成绩来达到反对马列主义、取消或削弱马列主义课程的可耻的目的。这就是你们的“帮助”。谁都知道没有马列主义的思想领导就不可能有社会主义建设的胜利，不对青年学生进行马列主义的教育，就不可能培养出全心全意为社会主义建设服务的人才。你们想在思想上推翻马列主义的领导，向工人阶级夺取领导权是办不到的。从对待马列主义课程的态度上也不难看出你们反社会主义的狰狞面目。在这件事情上又一次提醒我们，你们所深恶痛绝的，正是我们所必须爱护的；你们所要取消和削弱的，正是我们所应当巩固和加强的。你们的阴谋活动，促使我们用更大的努力来加强高等学校的马列主义课程的教学，使它成为富于战斗性的课程。
