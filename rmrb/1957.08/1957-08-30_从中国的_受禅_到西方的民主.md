Title: From China's "Abdication" to Western Democracy

    Bourgeois rightists, like all other counter-revolutionaries, deeply hate the people's democratic dictatorship. The reason is actually very simple. The "dictatorship" of the people's democratic dictatorship is aimed at those who oppose socialism. Standing on the position of opposing socialism, they naturally feel the threat and oppression of this dictatorship at all times. As for the people's democracy side, they cannot feel it. Because what they want is to abolish people's democracy and the "democracy" and "freedom" to dictate to the people.
    Therefore, while shouting for "democracy" and "freedom," they presented the specimen of "Western democracy" to those who were influenced by bourgeois ideology: "bicameral system," "one on stage, one off stage," "if you can't do it, I'll come; if I can't do it, you'll come," and so on.
    A hundred years ago, "Western democracy" did enjoy a great reputation, but now it seems to stink even among many Westerners. The Chinese may not be familiar enough with the Western "if you can't do it, I'll come," but they should understand what happened in China in the early years. As early as more than a thousand years ago, we in China had the thing of "if you can't do it, I'll come; if I can't do it, you'll come." Chinese literati have always regarded the abdication of Yao and Shun as sacred teachings. Therefore, Cao Cao's father and son, and Sima Zhao's father and son during the Three Kingdoms period, still had to play this trick. Cao Pi's abdication from the Han Dynasty and Sima Yan's abdication from the Wei Dynasty were all about "if you can't do it, I'll come"; and they forced the other party to say "If I can't do it, you come." The so-called sacred event of abdication is nothing more than that. Even Cao Pi himself said after accepting the abdication: "I know the affairs of Shun and Yu!" In fact, whether Cao Pi came or Sima Yan came, ordinary people had no part in the world. At that time, if an ordinary person ran to the weeping emperor and said: "If you can't do it, let me come," I think he would be beheaded. The author of Romance of the Three Kingdoms said that this was "re-abdication and following the pattern," which shows that even he understood that this was a trick. National affairs, legends are so unreliable, distant legends across the ocean, if not confirmed, should be more suspicious, right?
    The Western "if you can't do it, I'll come" seems to be better than the Chinese version in the early years. After all, it has a civilized form of "parliament." The bourgeois gentlemen (who are superficially more civilized than the feudal lords) at least no longer have to bring swords to force the palace like Cao and Sima; nor do they have to pretend to set up an abdication platform temporarily. With ready-made venues and teams, they just "wah, wah" for a while, and then make a play of "if you can't do it, I'll come." "Westerners" probably love "civilized democracy" very much. Last night, while flipping through the Soviet novel "Birch Tree," I saw such a typical example. A German commander forced Soviet peasants to elect a very selfish peasant as the village head. He said: "I propose that everyone elect Mr. Lopukhov as your village head. Anyone opposed? No, dismiss, quickly." After the people dispersed, he said to this "elected" village head: "You must listen to the orders of the German commander." And his order was to confiscate all the wheat from the peasants and hang those who resisted. In the eyes of rightists, this is probably very democratic, but we hold the opposite view.
    Although I have not made a field trip to the Western "if you can't do it, I'll come," I also have some grounds to suspect that it is still "following the pattern." Since the end of World War II, the French government has changed 23 times in just over ten years. This can be said to be the highest level of "if you can't do it, I'll come." But changing back and forth, it has never left the circle of the bourgeoisie. You "come" and then I "come," several bourgeois parties have taken turns several times. It can be considered that they have all proven that they "can't do it," right? Today, the French Communist Party, which has the highest prestige in the country, is still the largest party in parliament, which is enough to prove that the French people think it is the most "capable," but the bourgeoisie is still unwilling to let it "come" for a while. It turns out that the so-called "you" and "I" are mutual titles of the bourgeoisie. The people are the ruled, how can they be qualified to be called you and I together with them. Is this kind of "democracy" really so lovely? As for the United States, which openly persecutes progressive people, is there any need to say more?
    The rightists embellish the Western "if you can't do it, I'll come" as a kind of "vitality" in order to move it to the Chinese. In fact, this is slapping yourself in the face. Doesn't what you call the "failure" of the bourgeoisie refer to the inability of the bourgeoisie to rule the people? "If you can't do it, I'll come" can barely cope for a while, but it is only a dead force that maintains a dying struggle. As for in our newborn country, the Communist Party is not only "capable," but this "capability" has a long future. Without citing other examples, isn't the hardship tasted by the rightists also evidence? Dreaming of pushing it away, "if you can't do it, I'll come," and adding the sentence "if I can't do it, you come" to show impartiality (which the Western bourgeoisie has never said to the people), also cannot deceive people. We honestly and impolitely say: "Not allowed!" Because history has long shown that they are not capable, and besides, judging from the affairs of ancient and modern China and foreign countries, once they have power, they will have no part for the people at all.
    Let's talk about a very simple common sense: a minority using force to suppress the majority will not be able to suppress it in the end; a majority using truth to suppress a minority will eventually suppress it. As for the internal democracy of the people, it is still developing fully, but this has little to do with the rightists who refuse to repent.

### 从中国的“受禅”到西方的民主

    从中国的“受禅”到西方的民主
　　阮延顺
    资产阶级右派，同一切其他反革命一样，刻骨地仇视人民民主专政。这原因其实很简单。人民民主专政的“专政”，是针对着反对社会主义的人的。他们站在反对社会主义的立场上，自然便时刻感到这专政的威胁和压迫。至于人民民主这一面，他们是感受不到的。因为，他们所要的是取消人民民主和对人民专政的“民主”和“自由”。
    于是，他们一边发出了要求“民主”、“自由”的喊声，一边便向蒙受资产阶级思想影响的人献出“西方民主”的标本：“两院制”、“一个在台上，一个在台下”、“你不行我来，我不行你来”，等等。
    一百年前，“西方民主”确曾飨过盛名，不过，现在好像就在许多西方人中也已臭得很了。中国人对于西方的“你不行我来”，或许还不够熟悉，但对中国早年的事总应该是懂得的。早在一千多年前，我们中国就有过“你不行我来，我不行你来”的事了。中国文人们，素以尧舜禅让的事作圣训。因此，三国时候的曹操父子、司马昭父子，都还要耍这套把戏。曹丕禅汉，司马炎禅魏，都是说的“你不行，我来”；而且是硬逼对方说出“我不行，你来”的。所谓禅让的圣事，也不过如此。连曹丕本人在受禅以后都说：“舜、禹之事，朕知之矣！”其实，不管是曹丕来也好，司马炎来也好，反正天下没有小百姓的份。当时，如果有个老百姓跑去对那哭鼻流水的皇帝说：“你不行，让我来吧”，我看要被杀头的。三国演义作者说这是“再受禅依样画葫芦”，就说明连他也懂得这是骗术。本国的事，传说还这样不可靠，远隔重洋的传说，倘未加证实，是更应该怀疑的了吧？
    西方的“你不行我来”，好像要比中国早年的那种好些。它究竟是有了“议会”这种文明的形式，资产阶级老爷们（较之封建主他们表面上是文明些的），起码再不用像曹、司马那样去带剑逼宫了；更不必装腔作势地临时搭禅台。现成的场子和班子，只要“哇啦哇啦”一阵，就作出“你不行我来”的戏了。“西方人”大概是很爱好“文明的民主”的。昨夜翻苏联小说“白桦”，看到过这样一个典型。德寇司令官，强迫苏联农民选一个非常自私自利的农民作村长。他说：“我提议大家来选洛普霍夫先生作你们的村长。有人反对吗？没有，解散，快。”当人们走散以后，他就对这位“民选”的村长说：“你要听德国司令官的命令。”而他的命令就是，劫收农民所有的小麦，和绞死反抗的人。这在右派分子们看来，大约是很民主的吧，但我们却持有相反的看法。
    我对西方的“你不行我来”，虽没有作过实地的考察，不过，也有些根据使我怀疑它仍还是“依样画葫芦”。从二次大战后短短十多年，法国政府变更了二十三次。这可说是“你不行我来”的大乘了。但是变来变去，也未曾出过资产阶级的圈子。你“来”过了，我又“来”，几个资产阶级政党，像走马灯一样，都轮过几遍了。总算证明它们都“不行”了吧？今天功冠全国的法国共产党还是议会中的第一大党，足可证明法国人认为它是最“行”的了，但资产阶级却还不肯让它“来”一下。原来所谓“你”“我”者，乃资产阶级互相之称谓也，人民是被统治者，哪有资格同它们并称你我。难道这种“民主”，真就那么可爱？至于公开迫害进步人士的美国，还用得着说吗？
    右派分子把西方的“你不行我来”粉饰为一种“活力”，以便把它搬给中国人。其实，这是自己打嘴，难道你们所谓的资产阶级的“不行”，还不就是指的资产阶级对人民统治不下去？“你不行我来”，虽可勉强凑合一时，但也不过是维系着苟延残喘的死力而已。至于在我们这个新生的国家里，共产党不仅“行”，而且这种“行”的来日方长。别的例证不举，右派分子们尝到的苦头不就也是证据。梦想推开它，“你不行我来”，而且为了表示存心公道，还加了句“我不行你来”（这是西方资产阶级不曾对人民说过的），也是骗不了人的。我们老实不客气的说：“不让”！因为历史早就说明他们不行了，何况，根据古今中外的事看来，他们一朝权在手，便压根没了人民的份儿。
    说说一种极简单的常识吧：少数人用强力压多数人，最终是压不住；多数人用真理压少数人，最终要压下去。至于人民内部的民主，还正在充分的发展，不过这是与死不悔改的右派分子没有多大关系的。
