Never Allow the Hiroshima Tragedy to Repeat!
Youth from Various Countries Gather to Demand a Ban on Hydrogen Bombs

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th: Representatives of youth from various countries participating in the World Youth Festival gathered today to demand a ban on the production, testing, and use of atomic and hydrogen weapons. This gathering was initiated by the Japanese delegation, as August 6th marks the twelfth anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima by the United States.

At the entrance to the meeting place, Japanese youth distributed to each attendee a paper dove, a booklet titled "Never Allow the Hiroshima Tragedy to Repeat," and a photograph of an "Atomic Disaster Map." The booklet contained an appeal from the Japanese delegation to the youth and students of the world.

The head of the Japanese delegation, Susumu Sano, and Akira Kazami, a member of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, spoke first at the meeting. They called on youth around the world to rise up and fight for a ban on the use of inhumane atomic and hydrogen weapons. They said that if the youth of the world demand a ban on atomic weapons, then atomic weapons will be banned.

Naoko Nagata, a girl from Nagasaki and a victim of the atomic bomb, also spoke. Her experiences aroused deep sympathy from everyone, and her appeal was met with enthusiastic responses. Thunderous applause was given to her from every corner of the hall.

Following this, representatives from the World Federation of Democratic Youth and the International Union of Students, as well as youth representatives from various countries, took to the stage to speak. They unanimously condemned the inhumane act of the American imperialists in dropping the atomic bomb, and demanded that all countries possessing atomic and hydrogen weapons engage in negotiations to ban atomic weapons.

Tan Zhuofen, a member of the Chinese delegation, spoke on behalf of the Chinese youth. He expressed that the Chinese youth support the Japanese movement to ban the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and will never allow the Hiroshima and Nagasaki tragedies of twelve years ago to repeat.

    决不允许广岛事件重演！
    各国青年集会要求禁止氢弹
    据新华社莫斯科6日电　参加世界青年联欢节的各国青年代表今天集会要求禁止生产、试验和使用原子武器和氢武器。这次集会是日本代表团发起的，因为8月6日是广岛遭受美国原子弹轰炸十二周年。
    日本青年在会场入口处发给每一位到会者一只纸鸽子，一本题为“决不允许广岛事件重演”的小册子和一幅“原子灾害图”的照片。小册子中载有日本代表团致世界青年和学生的呼吁书。
    日本代表团团长佐野进、日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会委员风见章首先在会上讲了话。他们要求全世界青年奋起为禁止使用灭绝人性的原子武器和氢武器而斗争。他们说，假如全世界青年都要求禁止原子武器，那末原子武器就将被禁止。
    原子弹受害人、长崎姑娘永田尚子也讲了话。她的遭遇引起大家深厚的同情，她的号召获得了热烈的响应。全场每一个角落向她发出雷鸣般的掌声。
    接着，世界民主青年联盟和国际学生联合会的代表、各国青年代表纷纷登台演说，他们一致谴责美帝国主义者投掷原子弹的无人道的行为，并且要求各个拥有原子武器、氢武器的国家进行禁止原子武器的谈判。
    中国代表团团员谭卓芬代表中国青年讲了话。他表示中国青年支持日本禁止使用原子武器和氢武器运动，决不允许十二年前的广岛、长崎事件重演。
