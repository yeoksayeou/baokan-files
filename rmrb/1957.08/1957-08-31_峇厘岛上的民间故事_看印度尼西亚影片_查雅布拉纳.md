A Balinese Folk Tale
——Watching the Indonesian Film "Tjaja Boelan"
　　Zhang Youjun
    On the Indonesian islands of coconut palms and banana trees, many beautiful and moving folk tales have been passed down for thousands of years. The diligent and simple Indonesian people have inherited these folk tales from generation to generation. After Indonesia gained independence, writers who loved their country's literary heritage began to excavate the treasures of folk literature,整理、出版them, and some of them were adapted into films, which were welcomed by the Indonesian people.
    The film "Tjaja Boelan" is a folk tale circulating on the island of Bali.
    Bali is called the "Island of Poetry" because: Bali is surrounded by the sea on all sides, the island has picturesque scenery, inhabited by people who can sing and dance, and world-famous ancient temple architecture and sculpture art. However, those who are familiar with the ancient history of Bali know that this "Island of Poetry" also had its feudal era. Those feudal kings and nobles occupied the fertile land on the island, plundered the people's wealth, and created many tragedies in this "paradise on earth." Now, "Tjaja Boelan," brought to the screen by Indonesian filmmakers, vividly narrates a moving tragedy to the audience, a tragedy that took place in Bali hundreds of years ago.
    The film begins with the cremation ceremony of Tjaja Boelan's remains. Tens of thousands of people participated in the cremation ceremony on the beach, piously commemorating Tjaja Boelan, who was killed by the treacherous king. At this time, the following narration is issued in the film:
      "Why is Tjaja Boelan's cremation ceremony so lively? Why is Tjaja Boelan praised by all the residents of Bali? Why is his cremation ceremony more grand than the cremation ceremony of the emperors on Bali? Is it because he was once a superior figure on this island? ... No, Tjaja Boelan is an ordinary person. ..."
    Tjaja Boelan is an ordinary person. He lost his parents when he was young. A king in the corner of the island took him in and raised him. Tjaja Boelan grew up very handsome and had a pure and kind heart. But this king was a treacherous man, seemingly kind but with ulterior motives; in an attempt to seize Tjaja Boelan's beautiful wife, he set a trap for him to go on an expedition and poisoned Tjaja Boelan!
    Tjaja Boelan, an innocent young man, was killed! Tjaja Boelan's wife, when she was taken to the palace, remained firm and unyielding and committed suicide by poisoning! Such a tragedy is not abrupt in a country under feudal autocratic rule; those kings and nobles who are fed by the blood and sweat of the people do not hesitate to build their licentiousness on the suffering of the people, which is also common. How much the people hate these autocratic demons!
    The tragedy of Tjaja Boelan quickly led to the collapse of this small dynasty on the island of Bali at that time. The film ends with the people's uprising and the destruction of this feudal dynasty.
    Although the film "Tjaja Boelan" still has some shortcomings in the characterization of characters and the description of some plots, the filmmakers' good intentions and their stance against the feudal system are very clear. "Tjaja Boelan" is a valuable film; at the same time, it also has a distinct national character, which makes the audience increase their understanding of the customs and culture of Indonesia, which is very gratifying.

　　峇厘岛上的民间故事
　　——看印度尼西亚影片“查雅布拉纳”
    张又君
    在印度尼西亚的椰风蕉雨的岛屿上，千百年来流传着许多美丽动人的民间故事。勤劳淳朴的印度尼西亚人民，把这些民间故事世代相传地继承了下来，一直到印度尼西亚获得独立以后，热爱自己祖国文学遗产的文学家们，开始发掘民间文学的宝藏，把它们整理、出版，也有的被改编为电影，受到印度尼西亚人民的欢迎。
    影片“查雅布拉纳”，就是流传在峇厘岛上的一个民间故事。
    人们把峇厘叫作“诗之岛”，这是因为：峇厘四面环海，岛上风光如画，居住着能歌善舞的人民，还有世界驰名的古老寺庙建筑和雕刻艺术。但是，熟悉峇厘的古代历史的人都知道，这个“诗之岛”也曾经有过它的封建时代，那些封建王侯和贵族，占有着岛上的丰腴的土地，掠夺人民的财富，造成这“人间天堂”的许多悲剧。现在，由印度尼西亚的电影工作者搬上银幕的“查雅布拉纳”，形象地给观众叙述了一个动人的悲剧，这个悲剧就是发生在几百年前的峇厘。
    影片以查雅布拉纳遗骨的火葬仪式开始，成万成万的人在海滨参加了火葬仪式，虔诚地纪念被奸恶的国王杀害了的查雅布拉纳。这时，影片上发出一段这样的旁白：
      “为什么查雅布拉纳的火葬仪式这样热闹？为什么查雅布拉纳被全峇厘岛的居民所歌颂？为什么他的火葬仪式比起峇厘岛上的帝王的火葬仪式还要隆重？是不是因为他曾经是这个岛上高人一等的人物？……不是的，查雅布拉纳是一个普通人。……”
    查雅布拉纳是一个普通人。他从小就失去了父母。岛上角落里的一个国王收留了他，抚养他长大。查雅布拉纳长得十分英俊，而且有一颗纯洁和善良的心。而这个国王，却是貌似慈爱，心怀叵测的奸险人物；为了企图霸占查雅布拉纳的美丽的妻子，他竟设下派他出征的陷阱，阴毒地谋杀了查雅布拉纳！
    查雅布拉纳，一个无辜的青年被杀害了！查雅布拉纳的妻子，当她被掳入王宫以后，她坚贞不屈，服毒自杀了！这样的悲剧，在封建专制统治的国度里，它的发生是并不突兀的；那些用人民的血汗喂饱了的王侯贵族，他们不惜把自己的淫乐建筑在人民的痛苦上面，也是屡见不鲜的。人民是多么的痛恨这些专制魔王啊！
    查雅布拉纳的悲剧，很快地促成了当时峇厘岛上这个小王朝的崩溃。影片以人民的起义以及冲毁这个封建王朝而结束。
    影片“查雅布拉纳”虽然在人物性格的刻划和某些情节的描写上还有不够精练的地方，但是，制作者的善良的企图，以及他们的反对封建制度的立场却是十分明朗的。“查雅布拉纳”是一部有价值的影片；同时，它还具有鲜明的民族色彩，使观众看了，对于印度尼西亚的风土人情，增加了一些了解，这是很使人高兴的。
