    Let the Warmongers Grieve!

    The Chinese delegation participating in the Third World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament flew through the Japanese night sky on August 5th. At 23:50, the plane turned right and descended, we looked down at the myriad lights of Tokyo, then saw the welcoming crowd and waving five-star red flags at Haneda Airport.
    Head of the delegation, Cai Tingkai, stepped off the plane with a smile, warmly embraced Mr. Matsumoto Jiichiro, and then entered the lounge. Many Japanese friends and overseas Chinese were waiting there. At that moment, thunderous applause, warm handshakes and shouts, and bouquets of flowers all rushed towards the delegation. Japanese friends said that they had been waiting at the airport for two hours due to the flight delay; no! They had been waiting in Tokyo for several days due to the visa delay! But they finally waited, and it happened to coincide with the opening of the conference, which strengthened the conference. A friend said: This shows that the power of peace is irresistible, and our hope has not been dashed. Takenaka Katsuo, a representative of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, specifically mentioned in his welcoming speech that the arrival of the Chinese delegation from afar to participate in the conference would promote the success of the conference.
    At the opening ceremony on the 6th, many representatives spoke, unanimously emphasizing the prohibition of nuclear weapons and not allowing the Hiroshima tragedy to repeat itself. Many passionate speeches frequently touched the hearts of the participants. Hatanaka Masaharu, Secretary-General of the International Preparatory Committee of the conference, said in his opening speech: Recalling today twelve years ago, an American B29 aircraft appeared over Hiroshima and dropped an atomic bomb, turning the entire city of Hiroshima into a sea of ​​fire in an instant, and hundreds of thousands of lives were destroyed…. Hatanaka's speech made the entire atmosphere heavy, but as he shouted for peace, people's emotions rose again.
    The speech by Cai Tingkai of the Chinese delegation was highly valued. After expounding the Chinese people's consistent demand for the prohibition of nuclear weapons and the struggle for disarmament, he paid tribute to the Japanese people who have made contributions to opposing war and defending peace on behalf of the Chinese people, and expressed deep sympathy and condolences to the Japanese atomic bomb victims. Cai Tingkai's voice and emotions were so sincere and earnest that I saw a young Japanese man sitting beside me suppressing the hot tears that welled up in his eyes.
    However, the evening edition of the "Yomiuri Shimbun" on the 6th published a piece of news that contradicted the entire atmosphere of the conference: the Japan-U.S. Security Consultative Committee announced its establishment that morning. Japanese people pointed out in conversations that the committee is a step in the U.S. pushing its atomic strategy, based on the Japan-U.S. joint statement. People cannot help but ask, are Hatanaka Masaharu's shouts and the appeals of humanity just out of thin air? Who can say that defending peace is not humanity's top priority?
    In the midst of the hectic conference life, we spent an unforgettable and pleasant evening. On the evening of the 9th, the Chinese delegation was invited to attend the reception banquet hosted by Mr. Matsumoto Jiichiro, Chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Association and advisor to the Japan Socialist Party. Suzuki Mosaburo, Katsumada Kiyoshi, Tanaka Toshio and many other celebrities intimately conversed with the heads of the delegation Cai Tingkai and Zhao Puchu, and Secretary-General Zheng Senyu, deeply thanking the host for their profound friendship. While chatting happily, they enjoyed Japanese songs and dances performed by Mrs. Arida Hachiro. The atmosphere of friendship permeated everywhere, and the moonlight shone through the gray-black shadows of the trees onto the green grass.
    At the enthusiastic invitation of the Japan Asia Solidarity Committee, representatives from Asian and African countries such as China, India, Thailand, Burma, Ceylon, Indonesia, Egypt, and the Soviet Union went to Hakone for sightseeing on the afternoon of the 10th. Head of the delegation Cai Tingkai and Mrs. Nehru of India and others specifically visited the Fujikoshi Machinery Factory in Kawasaki City on the way to Hakone. Manager Fujii Tetsuo, an activist enthusiastic about peace and Asian-African solidarity, said in his speech that although our factory is not large in scale, its future is bright because it is engaged in production for peace. A representative of the Kawasaki City Council specially introduced that in order to prohibit atomic and hydrogen bombs, Kawasaki City sent twenty-seven peace representatives to Tokyo to participate in the conference. I saw in his eyes the will to demand peace and the hope that this city will develop in peace. Farewell Kawasaki, arriving at the famous Hakone in the evening. After taking a hot spring bath, Head of delegation Cai Tingkai and I changed into kimonos and wooden clogs, walked out of the Sanmi Villa with Japanese and Thai friends, strolled through the moonlit streets, listened to the flowing water of the Hayakawa River, looked up at the beautiful peaks of Mount Yumoto, and talked about the customs of Asian and African countries.
    On the eve of the conference entering the formal meeting, a celebration party with 20,000 representatives from all over Japan participating, which was also a gathering symbolizing the growing strength of peace, was held at the Tokyo Gymnasium on the afternoon of the 11th. When Zhao Puchu, deputy head of the Chinese delegation, mentioned in his speech that all the proposals of the Japanese people to oppose war and defend peace would be supported by the 600 million Chinese people, long-lasting applause resounded throughout the venue. Zhao Puchu finally shouted in Japanese: Long live the Japanese people! Long live Sino-Japanese friendship! Long live peace! Resonant cheers echoed throughout the venue.
    At this conference, I was moved more than once by the touching scenes. Look! When dozens of Japanese children presented flowers to representatives from more than 20 countries, the representatives held the children tightly in their arms, as if the peace will of the whole world were embracing each other. Listen! The song "No Atomic Bombs Allowed" sung in unison by 20,000 people resounded through the sky, which is the common call of people all over the world. Also, the "Sunagawa" song against the U.S. military base sung by the Central Chorus is so passionate and tragic! As Japanese friends said, the Japanese people's singing is the power of peace, and the power of peace is growing.
    Let those warmongers who want to use nuclear weapons to carry out wars of aggression grieve in the dark corners!

    让那些好战之徒伤心去吧！
    吴学文
    参加第三届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会的中国代表团，8月5日乘飞机飞行在日本的夜空中。二十三点五十分，飞机右旋下降，我们俯瞰着东京的万家灯火，接着望到了在羽田机场上欢迎的行列和摇动着的五星红旗。
    蔡廷锴团长微笑着走下了飞机，和松本治一郎先生热烈地拥抱，然后走进休息室。许多日本朋友和华侨都等在那里。这时，雷动般的掌声，亲切地握手与呼唤，一束束的鲜花，一齐涌向代表团。日本朋友说，由于飞机晚点，他们已经在机场等了两个钟点了；不！由于签证迟延，他们已经在东京等了几天了！但是终于等到了，而且正好赶上大会开幕，使大会增加了力量。一位朋友说：这说明和平的力量是不可阻的，我们的希望没有落空。日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会代表竹中胜男在欢迎词中特意提到，中国代表团能远道赶来参加大会，将促进大会的成功。
    在6日的大会开幕式上，许多代表致词一致强调禁止核武器与不允许广岛事件重演，许多激昂慷慨的讲话不时地打动着与会者的心弦。大会国际筹备中心事务局长畑中政春在致开幕词中说：回顾十二年前的今天，一架美国B29型飞机出现在广岛上空，投下了一颗原子弹，广岛全市瞬间变成了火海，十数万生命被毁灭了……。畑中的讲话使全场空气沉重了，但是，随着他呼吁和平的吼声，人们的情绪又高涨起来。
    中国代表团蔡廷锴的讲话，十分受到重视。他在阐述了中国人民一贯要求禁止核武器和争取裁军的主张后，代表中国人民向在反对战争、保卫和平有着贡献的日本人民致敬，并对日本原子弹受害者致以深切的同情与慰问。蔡团长讲话的声音和情感是那样的诚恳、殷切，我看到坐在我身边的一位日本青年在抑止着他那夺目而出的热泪。
    但是，6日“读卖新闻”晚刊上刊载了一条和整个大会气氛相反的消息：日美安全委员会就在这天上午宣告成立。日本人士在交谈中指出，委员会是根据日美共同声明而产生的美国推行原子战略的一个步骤。人们不禁要问，难道畑中政春的吼声和世界人类的呼吁是凭空而发的吗？谁能说保卫和平不是人类当务之急呢？
    在紧张的会议生活中，我们过了一个难忘而舒畅的夜晚。9日晚，中国代表团应邀出席了日中友好协会会长、日本社会党顾问松本治一郎先生的招待宴会。铃木茂三郎、胜间田清一、田中稔男等许多社会名流和蔡廷锴、赵朴初两团长及郑森禹秘书长亲密地交谈起来，客人对主人的深厚友情深深感谢。他们一边欢谈，一边欣赏着由有田八郎夫人表演的日本歌舞。到处洋溢着友好的气氛，月光透过了灰黑色的树荫照射着绿油油的草地。
    在日本亚洲团结委员会的热情招待下，中国、印度、泰国、缅甸、锡兰、印度尼西亚、埃及、苏联等亚非国家的代表在10日下午去箱根游览。蔡廷锴团长和印度尼赫鲁夫人等在去箱根的途中特意访问了川崎市不二越精机工厂。藤井哲夫经理是一位热心于和平及亚非团结的活动家，他在致词中说，我们的工厂虽然规模不大，但由于它为和平而进行生产，它的前途是远大的。川崎市议会代表特介绍说，为了禁止原子弹氢弹，川崎市派出了二十七名和平代表去东京参加大会。我从他的眼睛里看到了要求和平的意志和这个城市会在和平中得到发展的希望。别了川崎，傍晚到达名地箱根。在洗完温泉浴后，我和蔡廷锴团长换上和服与木屐，同日本和泰国的朋友走出三味庄，漫步月街头，听着早川的流水，仰望汤坂山的秀峰，谈论着亚非国家的风俗。
    大会进入正式会议的前夕，11日下午在东京体育馆举行了一个有日本全国各地二万名代表参加的庆祝晚会，也是象征着和平力量日益壮大的集会。当中国代表团副团长赵朴初在讲话中提到日本人民反对战争和保卫和平的一切主张都会受到六亿中国人民支持的时候，场内响起了经久不息的掌声。赵朴初最后特用日语高呼：日本人民万岁！日中友好万岁！和平万岁！共鸣的欢呼响彻了会场。
    在这次大会上，我不止一次地为动人的场面所感动。看！几十个日本儿童向二十多个国家代表献鲜花时，代表们把孩子紧紧地抱在怀中，好像全世界的和平意志都拥抱在一起了。听！二万人齐声高唱“不许使用原子弹”的歌声响彻云霄，这是全世界人民的共同呼声。还有，由中央合唱团演唱的反对美军基地的“砂川”之歌，是多么激昂、悲壮！正如日本朋友所说，日本人民的歌声就是和平的力量，而和平的力量正在日益壮大。
    让那些想利用核武器来进行侵略战争的战争贩子们在黑暗的角落里伤心去吧！
