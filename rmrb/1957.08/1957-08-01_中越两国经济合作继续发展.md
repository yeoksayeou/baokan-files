The trade delegations of the Chinese and Vietnamese governments signed two documents in Hanoi on July 31: the Sino-Vietnamese Agreement on Mutual Supply of Goods and Payments for 1957 and the Protocol on the People's Republic of China's Assistance to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for 1957. This is another important measure in Sino-Vietnamese economic cooperation, marking further consolidation and development of economic cooperation between the two countries.

According to the agreements and protocols signed this year, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam will supply China with rice, corn, tea, beef cattle, timber, used steel rails, chromite ore, phosphate rock, cement, various oils, southern medicines, etc., while China will supply the Democratic Republic of Vietnam with cotton, cotton yarn, cloth, steel, machinery, industrial raw materials, cultural supplies, paper, Chinese medicine, Western medicine, daily necessities, and various foods through trade and assistance. The mutual supply of these materials is of great significance for promoting the economic development and socialist construction of both countries.

China and Vietnam are close neighbors and brothers in the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union. In recent years, the Chinese and Vietnamese governments, based on the common needs of both sides for developing their national economies and on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, have made great efforts in economic cooperation between the two countries. As a result, Sino-Vietnamese economic cooperation has achieved great success. The scope of cooperation is expanding, and the forms of cooperation are becoming more and more diverse.

At present, there are three different forms of trade between China and Vietnam. The first is state trade between the two countries, which is the basic form of Sino-Vietnamese trade. This trade has developed greatly since it began in 1952. The trade volume in 1956 has increased thirteen times compared with 1952, and the variety of goods supplied to each other has also increased year by year. At present, Sino-Vietnamese trade ranks first in Vietnam's foreign trade. The second is the local barter trade between the local state-owned trading companies of both sides within the limits of the import and export permits stipulated by their respective government laws. This trade is mainly for the exchange of materials between border areas of the two countries and is a supplementary form of state trade between the two sides. The third is small-amount trade between border residents of both sides. This trade is a special form of trade established by both sides to adapt to the traditional economic exchanges between border residents of the two countries. Border residents of the two countries freely conduct small amounts of trade according to the border market and management methods agreed upon by the two governments.

China's grant-in-aid to Vietnam in economy is another form of Sino-Vietnamese economic cooperation. According to the joint communiqué issued by the Chinese and Vietnamese governments in July 1955, the Chinese government gratuitously grants the Democratic Republic of Vietnam 800 million yuan RMB from 1955 to 1959 for five years to help the Vietnamese people heal the wounds of war and restore and develop the national economy.

In recent years, the Chinese government has provided active assistance to Vietnam according to Vietnam's needs and China's capabilities. So far, the assisted projects include: helping Vietnam repair the Hanoi-Friendship Pass railway; helping Vietnam build a match factory, a radio station, a printing factory, and an oil depot; helping build enterprises that are currently under construction, such as international and domestic wireless telegraph stations and rice mills; and supplying Vietnam with railway locomotives and vehicles, ships for sea and river transportation, civil aircraft, and various equipment needed to restore and build transportation, postal and telecommunications and other departments, as well as the equipment and materials needed to restore large enterprises such as the Haiphong Cement Plant, the Hong Gai Coal Mine, the Nam Dinh Textile Mill, and the Hanoi Power Plant, and to build automobile repair shops and tire retreading plants, as well as industrial raw materials, building materials, laboratory equipment, and various necessities for people's lives and production. In addition, in order to help Vietnam solve the technical difficulties encountered in restoring its national economy, China has also sent a large number of engineers, technicians, and skilled workers to participate in Vietnam's construction, including personnel from the railway, highway, shipping, postal and telecommunications, agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, power, textile, and commercial departments. In addition, China has also accepted a large number of Vietnamese trainees to conduct production internships in various departments of China. At present, China's transportation, postal and telecommunications, railway, civil aviation, power, and textile departments all have Vietnamese trainees.

China's assistance to Vietnam is a glorious international obligation that the Chinese people should undertake and is also an important aspect of China's contribution to maintaining peace in the Far East and the world.

Secondly, in order to promote the development of economic cooperation and facilitate economic ties between the people of the two countries, China and Vietnam started direct joint transportation of passengers and goods between the two countries in 1955. In March of this year, China and Vietnam's transportation departments signed an agreement on the transportation of civilian goods between Yunnan Province and other provinces in mainland China through the territory of Vietnam. According to this agreement, the Vietnamese government agreed to exempt China's transit goods from tariffs, and railway freight will be handled in accordance with Vietnam's current railway transportation regulations. In this way, goods shipped in and out of Yunnan Province in China can be transported in and out in large quantities through this new transportation route. In terms of shipping and air transportation, China and Vietnam are also cooperating closely. In April 1956, China and Vietnam signed a civil aviation transportation agreement in Beijing. According to this agreement, both parties opened regular direct air links between the two countries. From then on, it is possible to reach Hanoi from Beijing by plane on the same day, which greatly shortens the spatial distance between China and Vietnam. In December 1956, China and Vietnam signed a maritime transportation agreement in Hanoi, and the maritime transportation line between Haiphong, Vietnam, and Guangzhou, China, which had been interrupted for many years, has now been restored. There is no doubt that the development of these transportation cooperation projects between the two countries has created more favorable conditions for economic and cultural exchanges between the two countries.

In addition, the close economic cooperation between China and Vietnam is also reflected in the fact that the two countries organize various professional visiting groups to visit and study each other in order to learn from and exchange experiences in economic construction. In recent years, Vietnam has sent visiting groups to China specializing in commerce, foreign trade, transportation, banking, and enterprise management. They have visited and inspected relevant departments in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Tianjin, and other places in China. At the same time, China has also sent agricultural and trade visiting groups to various places in Vietnam for inspection and visits. In September 1956, China also held an exhibition of China's economic construction achievements in Hanoi, Vietnam, which was visited by more than 900,000 people. During the exhibition, engineers and technicians from both sides also exchanged production experience.

In short, both sides take advantage of all possible opportunities to exchange and impart construction experience and production knowledge to each other, which is of great benefit to promoting the rapid improvement and development of the construction undertakings of the two countries.

This close economic cooperation between China and Vietnam fully embodies the principles of proletarian internationalism. This cooperation will continue to develop with the growth of friendly relations between the two countries.

    中越两国经济合作继续发展
    高竞生
    7月31日中越两国政府的贸易代表团在河内签订了中越两国1957年度互相供应货物和付款协定和关于1957年度中华人民共和国援助越南民主共和国的议定书两个文件，这是中越两国经济合作的又一重要措施，它标志着两国经济合作的进一步巩固和发展。
    根据今年签订的协定和议定书的规定，越南民主共和国将在今年内供应我国大米、玉米、茶叶、菜牛、木材、旧钢轨、铬矿砂、磷灰石、水泥、各种油料、南药等，而我国将通过贸易和援助的方式供应越南民主共和国棉花、棉纱、布匹、钢材、机器、工业原料、文化用品、纸张、中药、西药、日用百货和各种食品等。以上物资的相互供应，对于促进两国经济的发展和社会主义建设事业有着重要的意义。
    我国和越南是亲密的邻邦，也是以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭中的兄弟。几年来，中越两国政府根据双方发展国民经济的共同需要，基于平等互利的原则，对于两国间的经济合作作了很大的努力，因而中越两国的经济合作也取得了很大的成就。合作的范围日益广泛，合作的形式越来越多种多样。
    目前中越两国的贸易有三种不同的形式，一是两国间的国家贸易，这是中越贸易的基本形式，这种贸易从1952年开始到现在已有很大的发展，1956年的贸易额已增为1952年贸易额的十三倍，相互供应货物的品种也逐年增多。目前中越贸易在越南对外贸易中占居第一位。二是双方地方国营贸易公司之间根据各自政府法令规定的准进和准出为限的地方性的易货贸易，这种贸易主要是为了两国边境地方物资的交流的，是双方国家贸易的一个辅助形式。三是双方边境居民之间的小额贸易，这种贸易是双方为适应两国边境居民间传统性的经济往来而设的一种特殊的贸易形式，两国边境居民根据两国政府商定的边境市场和管理办法，自由进行小量的贸易。
    我国对越南在经济上的无偿援助是中越经济合作的另一种形式。根据1955年7月中越两国政府发表的联合公报的规定，从1955年起至1959年五年内，我国政府以八亿元人民币无偿地赠给越南民主共和国，用以帮助越南人民医治战争创伤，恢复与发展国民经济。
    几年来，我国政府根据越南的需要和我国的可能对越南进行了积极的援助。到目前为止，已经援助的项目有：帮助越南修复了河内至睦南关的铁路；帮助越南建成了火柴厂、广播电台、印刷厂、油库，帮助修建目前还在施工的有国际国内无线电发讯台、碾米厂等企业；同时并供应了越南为恢复和建设交通、邮电等部门所需的铁路机车及车辆、海运和河运所需的船舶、民用飞机等和各种器材，有恢复海防水泥厂、鸿基煤矿、南定纱厂、河内电厂等大型企业和修建汽车修配厂翻胎厂所需的设备和器材，还有工业原料、建筑材料、试验室设备以及人民生活和生产的各种必需品。此外，我国为了帮助越南解决在恢复国民经济中技术方面所遇到的困难，还派遣了大批工程技术人员和技工参加了越南的建设事业，派去的人员包括铁路、公路、航运、邮电、农业、林业、水利、电力、纺织、商业等部门的人员。另外，我国还接受了越南大批实习生到我国各部门进行生产实习，目前我国的交通、邮电、铁道、民航、电力、纺织部门，都有越南的实习生。
    我国给予越南这一些援助，是我国人民应该担负的光荣的国际义务，也是我国为维护远东及世界和平所作的贡献的一个重要方面。
    其次，我国同越南为了促进经济合作的发展，便利两国人民之间的经济联系，从1955年起就开始了两国间旅客及货物的直接联运。今年3月我国又同越南的交通部门签订了关于云南省与中国内地各省之间的民用货物通过越南国境运输的协定，根据这个协定，越南政府同意我过境运输的货物免征关税，铁路运费按照越南现行铁路运输规定办理。这样，我国云南省调出调入的货物，可由这个新的运输路线大量的运出和运入。在航运和空运方面，我国同越南也在密切地进行合作。1956年4月，我国同越南在北京签订了民用航空运输协定。根据这个协定，双方开辟了两国间定期直接的通航关系，从此由北京到河内乘飞机当天即可到达，这就大大缩短了中越两国的空间距离。1956年12月，中越两国在河内签订了两国海上运输的协定，于是中断多年的越南海防与我国广州的海上运输线，现在又恢复了。毫无疑问，两国这一些交通运输合作事业的发展为两国经济及文化交流创造了更加有利的条件。
    此外，中越两国密切的经济合作，还表现在两国在经济建设中为了相互学习和交流经验，组织各种专业参观团相互进行访问和考察。几年来，越南派来我国的有商业、对外贸易、交通运输、银行、企业的经营管理等专业的参观团体，他们曾到我国的上海、广州、北京及天津等地的有关部门进行了访问和考察。同时，我国也派了农业、贸易等参观团到越南各地进行了考察和访问。1956年9月，我国在越南河内还举办了一个中国经济建设成就展览会，参观的人有九十多万，在展览期间，双方的工程技术人员还交流了生产经验。
    总之，双方利用一切可能的机会，互相把建设经验及生产知识进行交流和传授，这对促进两国建设事业的迅速提高和发展是有很大益处的。
    中越两国这种亲密的经济合作，完全体现了无产阶级国际主义的原则。这种合作必将随着两国友好关系的增进而继续不断地向前发展。
