　　Prostrate Before Chiang Kai-shek, Bitterly Hated the Communist Party
　　Liu Yaxiu Was a Disgrace to the Religious Community
　　(Our Dispatch) The reactionary true colors of Liu Yaxiu, an old-brand rightist element cloaked in religious garb, a director of the Chinese Buddhist Association, and the director of the Propaganda Department of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee, have been completely exposed.

　　Since the Party's rectification campaign began, Liu Yaxiu has been spreading rumors everywhere, saying, "Now the Communist Party is setting up the ring, and we must all go to challenge it." He "wants to fight the Communist Party with real swords and guns," viciously slandering that "the Communist Party is equivalent to the Plain Yellow Banner after the Qing Dynasty entered the Pass, and those close to the Communist Party are equivalent to the Bordered Yellow Banner," comparing the relationship between the Party and activists to the relationship between Qing Dynasty masters and slaves.

　　According to revelations, as early as 1918, Liu Yaxiu colluded with the Northern Warlords, betraying the revolution led by Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Later, he joined the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group. At the graduation ceremony of Chiang Kai-shek's Emei Training Corps, he flattered Chiang, saying, "I am a Buddhist, and in the past, I thought Sakyamuni was a Buddha, and I prostrated myself before him; now, I think Chairman Chiang is also a Buddha, and I also prostrate myself before him." However, Liu Yaxiu had a deep-seated hatred for the Communist Party. During his tenure as the pseudo-commissioner of Nanchong, Liu personally went to Yilong to urge the pseudo-county magistrate to dig up the ancestral grave of Vice Chairman Zhu De.

　　After liberation, Liu Yaxiu hated the Party and the people even more. He harbored Dai Chuanxin, who had made contributions to opposing the Communists in northern Jiangsu and was later promoted to commander of the Shanghai Garrison, at his home and helped him escape. During the land reform, Liu Yaxiu hid gold, silver, and grain belonging to Zhou Shoumin, a pseudo-provincial senator and big landlord, taking these fruits of victory belonging to the peasants for himself; at the same time, he cried out for justice for landlords and counter-revolutionaries who were struggled against and suppressed. Liu said with great regret, "It's a pity that I didn't participate in the preparatory committee of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee in 1950. If I had participated, I could have saved some people." When he heard that his counter-revolutionary friends Dai Shiqi and others were going to confess, he said, "These people are really pitiful! They didn't work hard to fight the Communist Party in the beginning, and they didn't flee abroad later. Now they can only confess and become prisoners. I sympathize with them." In 1953, due to the activities of Chen Mingshu, a rightist leader of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee Central Committee, Liu Yaxiu was dragged into the council of the National Buddhist Association. Since then, Liu has used the name of the Buddhist Association to frantically stir up trouble everywhere, provoking the relationship between Buddhists and the Party. In order to protect freedom of religious belief, the Party has built many historical sites and temples, but Liu falsely accused that "this is seizing the sovereignty of the temples."

### 对蒋介石五体投地　对共产党刻骨仇恨  刘亚休是宗教界的败类

　　对蒋介石五体投地　对共产党刻骨仇恨
　  刘亚休是宗教界的败类
    本报讯　披着宗教外衣的老牌右派分子、中国佛教协会理事、民革四川省委宣传处处长刘亚休的反动原形已经彻底揭露。
    从党整风开始，刘亚休四出扬言：“现在是共产党摆擂台，我们都要去打擂台”，他“要和共产党动真刀真枪”，恶毒地污蔑“共产党等于清朝入关以后的正黄旗，接近共产党的人等于镶黄旗”，把党和积极分子间的关系比作清朝主子和奴才的关系。
    根据揭露，远在1918年，刘亚休就勾结北洋军阀，背叛了孙中山先生领导的革命。后来又投靠蒋介石反动集团。在蒋介石的峨嵋训练团毕业典礼会上，向蒋献媚说：“我是学佛的，过去我认为释迦牟尼是一尊佛，我对他是五体投地；现在，我认为蒋委员长也是一尊佛，我对他也是五体投地。”但，刘亚休对共产党却是刻骨仇恨的。刘在南充伪专员任内，曾亲自到仪陇督促伪县长挖掘朱德副主席的祖坟。
    解放后，刘亚休更加仇恨党和人民。他把一个曾在苏北反共有功、后被提升为上海警备司令的戴传炘窝藏在家，并掩护他脱逃。土地改革时，刘亚休一面隐藏伪省参议员、大地主周首民的金、银、粮食等，把这些属于农民的胜利果实攫为己有；一面为被斗被镇压的地主反革命分子四出呼冤。刘很后悔地说：“1950年的民革筹委会可惜我没有参加，如果参加了，可以救一部分人。”他听到他的反革命朋友戴士琦等要自首时说：“这批人真可怜啊！当初既不努力打共产党，以后又不向外逃走，现在只有自首作阶下囚，我很同情他们。”1953年，由于民革中央右派头子陈铭枢的活动，把刘亚休拉进全国佛教协会理事会。自此，刘便借佛教协会名义，更加疯狂地到处点火，挑拨佛教徒和党的关系。党为了保护宗教信仰自由，修建了许多古迹庙宇，而刘却诬蔑说“这是夺取庙宇主权”。
