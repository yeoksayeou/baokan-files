    Primary School Run by Railway Workers

    To solve the problem of their children's education, the workers of the Weitan Station and the road maintenance section of the Baoji-Lanzhou Railway have established a primary school. The teachers in the school are family members with junior high school education, and the school equipment is made by the road maintenance workers using discarded sleepers. The elementary school students are racing.

    铁路工人办的小学
    宝兰线渭滩车站和养路工区的职工为了解决自己子女的学习问题，办了一所小学。学校的教师都是由具有初中文化水平的家属担任，校具也都是由养路工人利用废枕木做成。这个小学的小学生们正在赛跑。
