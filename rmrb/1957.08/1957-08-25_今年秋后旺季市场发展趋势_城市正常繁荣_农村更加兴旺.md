Xinhua News Agency, August 24th -- Xinhua News Agency reporter Hai Lan reported on the market development trends for the second half of the year, saying: Judging from the current situation, social purchasing power in the second half of this year will increase in rural areas compared to the same period last year, and decrease in cities compared to the same period last year. The urban peak season will maintain normal prosperity, while the rural market will show a new atmosphere of greater prosperity than last year. Under the condition that the difference between commodity supply and purchasing power is not large, except for cotton cloth, which is supplied with ration coupons, petroleum, which is carefully supplied according to plan, and coal, which is further rationally arranged to meet the minimum needs, the supply of other industrial products will increase compared to the same period last year. These can be actively sold to meet the needs of the peak season market.

According to commercial departments, after last year's wage reform, the wage increases for workers were concentrated in the third quarter, which further affected the urban peak season market last year. This year, there is no such factor.

There are many conditions that contribute to a more prosperous rural peak season market. The main reason is that a bumper harvest of agricultural products is expected in the second half of this year, and the amount of agricultural products purchased by the state in rural areas will exceed last year. For hogs alone, it is estimated that more than 16 million head can be reached, while only 14.64 million head were purchased in the second half of last year. The increase in state purchases means a larger amount of currency in circulation. According to preliminary calculations by the Ministry of Commerce, the income of farmers nationwide will increase in the second half of the year compared to the same period last year.

The timing of this year's peak season will also be somewhat different from last year. Last year, the market was very strong from the beginning of the third quarter. This year, the peak season may be concentrated in the fourth quarter until next spring. The market in the third quarter can only maintain last year's level, and some areas may even fall below last year's level. This is because the distribution method of agricultural cooperatives is somewhat different this year compared to last year. Last year's summer harvest distribution adopted a "less deduction, more distribution" method. The result of the implementation was that too little was deducted and too much was distributed. In many places, a portion of the purchasing power in the third quarter was actually an advance of the fourth quarter. This situation was very common in provinces such as Anhui, Jiangsu, and Hunan. Last year, the summer harvest pre-distribution to cooperative members accounted for about 65% of the total value of the summer harvest. This year, it will be reduced to about 45%. The various loans repaid by farmers to the state and the production expenses retained by agricultural cooperatives will increase compared to last year. Therefore, although the total value of the summer harvest is larger than last year, the income of members in the third quarter will generally not be more than last year. By the fourth quarter, when the autumn harvest is finally distributed, farmers' income will increase compared to the same period last year, which will make the peak season more concentrated.

The goods needed in the rural market during this year's peak season will also undergo significant changes. This is mainly reflected in the increased proportion of farmers' purchases of consumer goods. This change already began in the first half of the year. According to a recent survey in Shaoxing County, Zhejiang Province, the proportion of the composition of rural purchasing power is as follows: in the third quarter of last year, the purchase of consumer goods accounted for 66%; in the third quarter of this year, consumer goods will rise to 76%. Among consumer goods, general merchandise accounts for a large proportion.

Will the rural market after the autumn be more prosperous than last year, and will there be a shortage of goods? This is a question of concern to everyone. According to the analysis of materials obtained by reporters from relevant departments, the supply of some commodities will be tight, but from the overall market perspective, it has been gradually easing since the summer of this year. This is because the state has adopted measures to balance fiscal revenue and expenditure, balance credit revenue and expenditure, control the amount of basic construction investment, and control social purchasing power, and has continued to carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy and the socialist ideological education movement throughout the country. Therefore, starting from the second quarter, especially after the summer harvest crops entered the market one after another, the market situation changed, from tight to easing. Industrial product inventories have gradually increased from decreasing, the market currency circulation situation has returned to normal, and prices have been basically stable.

The supply of high-end goods to cities in the second half of this year, such as woolen fabrics, radios, and watches, is sufficient. The supply of small commodities and small hardware, which are suitable for rural needs, is greater than in any previous year's peak season. The supply of knitwear, rubber shoes, thermos bottles, transportation and electrical equipment, building materials, cultural supplies, and other materials needed by both urban and rural areas will not be lower than the supply level in the second half of last year. Due to limited supply, cotton cloth and coal will be difficult to fully meet market needs for a while. The supply of non-staple foods has increased significantly. The means of production have also changed from being in short supply last year to being generally balanced in supply and demand. Currently, all regions are vigorously organizing sources of goods, and peak season materials have begun to enter the market.

China has a vast territory, and the growth of purchasing power is uneven between urban and rural areas and between regions, which makes commodity allocation very difficult. The situation of temporary and localized shortages of certain commodities or shortages in one place and stockpiles in another is still difficult to avoid. The Ministry of Commerce has listed doing a good job in commodity allocation, rationally scheduling and adjusting commodities as one of the important tasks for the current peak season supply. In order to ensure the supply during the rural peak season, the supply of industrial products by commercial departments in various regions will continue to implement the spirit of actively supporting rural areas. Under the condition of preventing blind decentralization, a considerable number of commodities suitable for rural areas will be sent to rural areas. At present, in the situation where many commodities are still in short supply, in addition to doing a good job in commodity allocation and supply, the Ministry of Commerce also hopes that all regions will pay attention to social savings and promote the fine tradition of diligence and thrift.

    今年秋后旺季市场发展趋势
    城市正常繁荣　农村更加兴旺
    新华社24日讯　新华社记者海蓝报道下半年市场的发展趋势说：从目前的许多情况看来，今年下半年社会购买力，将是农村比去年同期增多，城市比去年同期减少。城市旺季将保持正常繁荣，农村市场将出现比去年更旺的新气象。物资供应在商品和购买力差额不很大的条件下，除了棉布采取凭票供应、石油认真按计划供应、煤炭进一步合理安排以满足最低限度的需要外，其他工业品供应数量都比去年同期增加，可以积极销售，以供应旺季市场的需要。
    根据商业部门了解，去年工资改革以后，职工增加的工资都集中在第三季度发放，这就更加影响了去年城市旺季市场，而今年没有这个因素。
    造成农村旺季市场更旺的条件是多方面的。主要原因是今年下半年农产品可望丰收，国家在农村采购的农产品数量将超过去年。仅生猪一项，预计可达到一千六百万头以上，而去年下半年只收购一千四百六十四万头。国家收购量增加，货币投放额也就大了。据商业部初步计算，下半年全国农民收入将比去年同期有所增加。
    今年旺季的时间也将和去年有些不同。去年第三季度一开始，市场就很旺。今年旺季可能集中在第四季度直到明年春天。第三季度市场只能保持去年水平，有些地区甚至会低于去年水平，这是因为今年农业合作社分配办法和去年有些不同。去年夏收分配采取“少扣多分”的办法，执行结果是扣得太少，分得过多。不少地方第三季度的一部分购买力实际上是预支第四季度的，这种情况在安徽、江苏、湖南等省很普遍。去年夏收预分给合作社社员的约占夏收总值65％左右，今年将降为45％左右，第三季度农民归还国家的各项贷款和农业社留用的生产费用都将比去年有所增多，所以夏收总值虽比去年大，但第三季度社员的收入一般不会比去年多。到第四季度秋收决分时，农民收入会比去年同期增加，这就使旺季时间更加集中。
    今年旺季农村需要的商品也将有很大变化，这主要表现在农民购买生活资料的比重上升，这种变化在上半年就已开始。根据最近浙江省绍兴县调查，农村购买力构成的比重：去年第三季度购买生活资料占66％；今年第三季度生活资料将上升为76％。在生活资料中，百货占很大比重。
  秋后农村市场比去年更旺，物资供应是否会出现紧张局面呢？这是大家所关心的问题。据记者从有关部门得到的材料分析，有一部分商品供应是会紧张的，但从整个市场来看，从今年夏季起，是逐步走向缓和的。这是因为今年国家采取了平衡财政收支、平衡信贷收支、控制基本建设投资数量和控制社会购买力等措施，并在全国范围内继续深入开展了增产节约运动和开展社会主义思想教育运动。因此从第二季度开始，特别是夏收作物相继登场以后，市场情况发生了变化，从紧张趋向缓和。工业品商品库存从减少到逐步增加，市场货币流通情况已趋正常，物价基本稳定。
    今年下半年供应城市的高级商品如呢绒、收音机、手表等货源充足，适应农村需要的小百货、小五金等商品的供应量比过去任何一年的旺季都多。城乡都需要的针织品、胶鞋、暖水瓶以及交通电工器材、建筑材料、文化用品等物资都不低于去年下半年的供应水平。棉布、煤炭因货源有限，一时还难以完全满足市场需要。副食品供应数量已有较大的增加。生产资料也从去年供不应求到供求大体平衡。目前各地正在大力组织货源，旺季物资已开始应市。
    我国地区辽阔、城乡之间地区之间购买力增长不平衡，这就使商品摆布发生很大困难。某些地区某种商品呈现一时一地的脱销或此处脱销、彼处积压的状况还难避免。商业部已把作好商品摆布工作、合理调度和调节商品，列为当前旺季供应的重要任务之一。为了保证农村旺季供应，各地商业部门的工业品供应，将继续贯彻积极支援农村的精神，在防止盲目下放的条件下，把相当数量适应农村的商品放到农村去。目前在许多商品还是供不应求的情况下，商业部除做好商品摆布和调拨供应工作外，同时希望各地注意社会节约，发扬勤俭持家的优良作风。
