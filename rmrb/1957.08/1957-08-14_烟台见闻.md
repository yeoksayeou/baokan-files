    Sights and Sounds of Yantai
    Lǐ Fēng
    
    Yantai is a famous fishing port where fish and shrimp can be caught all year round, and a beautiful "land of fruits and flowers."
    
    The scenery of Yantai is indeed beautiful, but the labor of the Yantai people and their wisdom in beautifying life are even more attractive.
    
    The Secret of the Insurance Lock
    
    In Qingdao, we heard that the locks from the Chengming Lock Factory are one of the "three treasures" of Yantai. Among 5,000 to 16,000 locks of the same size and style, no two keys can be interchanged. The masses praised it as an "insurance lock."
    
    With a desire to learn and curiosity, the reporter visited more than sixty production processes of this factory, but still did not see the secret of "insurance." Liu Jichen, the deputy director of the factory, said: "You'll understand when you see the key drawings."
    
    Deputy Director Liu brought a thick sample of key drawings. There were no key drawings on it, but groups of Arabic numerals. It turned out that this was the "insurance" code of the "insurance lock." Each numeral represents the depth of a tooth groove on the key, with "1" being the shallowest, "2" the next shallowest, "3" deeper, and "4" the deepest. Using these four numerals, based on the size of the key and the number of tooth grooves that can be cut, three to six groups are compiled. The numerals are arranged in a way that changes as much as telegraphic codes. The keys made according to this will never be interchangeable (the manufacture of keys and lock cores is mutually adaptable).
    
    This factory is the largest producer of padlocks in the country, with a planned production of nearly 400,000 locks this year. Some locks will also be exported. At the time of liberation, the factory had only seven people, with an annual output of less than 3,000 locks.
    
    The lock-making technology is so precise, what about the precision of the equipment? Copper smelting is done in pits in the ground. The copper smelting furnace is a sand pot the size of a long watermelon. One sand pot is used for a week, and if it breaks, it is thrown away and replaced with a new one made of sand and soil. There are only thirty or so machines, including grinding wheels, and most of them were designed by Deputy Director Liu Jichen himself. The best factory buildings are tiled bungalows, and some factory buildings are thatched sheds built twenty years ago.
    
    Liu Jichen can also be said to be a remarkable person! He has not received any training in lock-making technology, and only studied in a private school for two days. His lock-making technology was learned from commodities. He dissected imported American locks and gradually researched and mastered the technology of manufacturing spring locks (he did not know if China had already made spring locks at that time). Before studying lock-making, he worked as a watch repairman for ten years. Watch repair should have been learned through apprenticeship or expert guidance, right? But he started doing it like learning to make locks. Liu Jichen said that he was a poor peasant at the time and had no way to make a living. Poverty forced him to do so, and doing so brought him wisdom.
    
    Embroidery with More Than Two Million Stitches
    
    In a handicraft company in Yantai, the reporter witnessed the production of linen embroidery and woolen embroidery, which are famous at home and abroad.
    
    Linen embroidery has a linen base, in its natural color; the embroidery thread is a linen product, in silver-gray color. The embroidered products are mostly tablecloths and napkins for banquets and dinners. The reporter saw the largest tablecloth, embroidered with more than two million stitches, measuring 216 inches long and 72 inches wide. Ordinary living rooms do not have enough space for it. It can be used for banquets of thirty-six people and comes with napkins for thirty-six people. An employee said that it takes a female embroidery worker ten months to produce such a set. After the employee unfolded this surprisingly large tablecloth, the skillful embroidery brought a magnificent atmosphere to the finished product warehouse we were visiting, but it was simple and elegant without being vulgar.
    
    Woolen embroidery is a handicraft with higher artistic value. Its production requires higher skills. Most people, even the girls who are best at choosing and matching colors to dress themselves up, may not be able to count twenty kinds of colors, while woolen embroidery thread has more than two hundred colors. These woolen threads can embroider various beautiful mountain scenery of nature on tapestries, carpets, backrests, chair cushions, women's handbags, slippers, etc. They can be embroidered into portraits of great people, or into particularly exquisite decorations, inlaid on rings or brooches. The manager and chairman of the labor union of the company showed us the world-famous painting "The Last Supper" and the oil painting "Shepherdess" and other woolen embroideries, with vivid figures, scenery, flowers, birds, and animals.
    
    Standing in front of these unique handicrafts, which can truly be said to be ingenious, we feel that we lack the knowledge to appreciate them. A sense of admiration naturally makes us wonder about the age, training, and education level of the designers and embroiderers of these handicrafts. They are very different from what we imagined. The average age of the linen embroidery workers in this company is less than twenty years old; most of the purchased linen embroidery is from rural women near Yantai. The chairman of the labor union said that the designer of those best woolen embroideries is a twenty-two or twenty-three-year-old girl named Xu Ruoyu. She probably graduated from junior high school a few years ago and did not pass the high school entrance examination, or she did not want to continue her studies and devoted herself to learning embroidery and painting. Time did not allow the reporter to meet this "embroidery champion," but according to the manager's and the labor union chairman's brief introduction to her, her personality and interests may be similar to Sanya, the girl in the play "Dawn Shines on Moscow" who was determined to go to the factory to learn to print fabrics and beautify people's lives after graduating from middle school.
    
    Fragrant and Refreshing Famous Wine
    
    Yantai accounts for three of the eight famous wines in the country. Among the eight famous wines, Moutai, Fenjiu, Fengjiu from Liulin Town, Daqu from Luzhou Changchun Winery, and Shaoxing wine from Yunji Winery are all made from grain, only Vermouth, Golden Brandy, and Red Rose are wines; all produced by Yantai Zhangyu Winery.
    
    Golden Award Brandy won the highest gold medal and certificate at the Panama International Exposition in 1915. Vermouth contains fourteen kinds of Chinese medicines, including gentian, cinnamon, angelica, cloves, saffron, etc. This wine is a tonic and can also regulate menstruation and replenish blood for women. An agricultural professor said that other wines in our country also contain Chinese medicine, but they have a medicinal taste. Although Vermouth contains fourteen kinds of Chinese medicines, it has a fragrant and refreshing taste and no medicinal taste.
    
    In the past, Vermouth was produced under the guidance of foreign engineers, and the wine formula was a secret. In order to keep it secret, the trademarks were scraped off when the raw materials entered the factory. The current ingredient formula is summarized by veteran workers and technicians based on years of experience.
    
    The manager and engineers of the company said that the company's three famous wines have a "unity of opposites" character: fragrant and sweet without a sugary taste, strong but not irritating to the stomach, and mellow and mild in nature without being strong. This is also the main standard for all good fruit wines. In addition, the wine color is particularly bright and transparent, without being turbid or having sediment.
    
    To achieve such standards, it first depends on the raw materials. The company's hundreds of thousands of grapevines, such as Italia, Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc, and more than twenty other varieties, are all selected from excellent varieties from various European countries. These grapes have thin skins, juicy pulp, high sugar content, and strong aroma. The juice of Weitianzi grapes can be said to be the reddest of reds. The three famous wines are almost entirely brewed from pure grape juice. Therefore, when the wine bottle is opened, the rich fruity aroma is intoxicating, indeed sweet and without a sugary taste, and it is naturally red without adding any coloring.
    
    The mellow and mild character of the wine is mainly due to the wine's "qualifications" being old. After the wine is brewed, it is sent to an underground cellar that can store 1,200 tons of wine. This warehouse is deep below sea level and is shaped like ten parallel railway tunnels. Even in the height of summer, we felt a chilling coolness here. The wine here is stored in a long row of drum-shaped oak barrels. The female engineer told us that oak contains pine and cypress alcohol, which, together with the wine, undergoes oxidation to produce vanillin. Over time, the wine's strength gradually diminishes, and it produces a pleasingly strong but mellow and mild character. The current aging period for brandy in this company is one to two years, and for wine it is two to three years.
    
    The famous wines here are inspected very strictly. First, they use physical and chemical inspection methods to analyze the alcohol content, sugar content, tannin (too much makes it astringent), pigment, protein, and esters that determine the aroma of the wine. In addition, they also analyze the metal content in the wine, such as iron, copper, and lead.
    
    The most important thing is to rely on sensory inspection, by smelling, tasting, and looking. The manager said that many countries have wine tasters or experts in wineries, and there are also famous wine tasting experts internationally. The noses and mouths of wine tasting experts are very knowledgeable. They can determine the fermentation time and temperature and other production conditions or defects of the wine, and can taste the age of the wine, or whether the grapes used to make the wine are suitable for winemaking, etc. Zhangyu Company does not currently have such talents, so they have established a seven-member wine tasting team. When a new product or batch of wine is released, the seven people sit around a table and taste it collectively, and then each person gives the wine a score for color, aroma, and taste.
    
    The Rooster and the Alarm Clock
    
    A story is circulating in Yantai: an old man, holding a rooster in one hand and an alarm clock in the other, came to the Deshunxing Clock Factory, which manufactured the alarm clock, and said to the manager: "Your clock! It's not as reliable as my rooster!" One person tells ten, and ten tell a hundred, and the story spread hundreds of miles away.
    
    The story is not true. The fact that the story reflects that the quality of the alarm clock is not good is true. The origin of the story is a cartoon published in the Yantai Labor News last spring criticizing the poor product quality of the Deshunxing Clock Factory.
    
    Half a year later, the alarm clock of the Deshunxing Clock Factory was rated as a first-class product at the National Light Industry Exhibition. A deputy director said that the accuracy of the factory's alarm clock is now generally within half a minute of error per day.
    
    The machines are still the machines from decades ago, the personnel are still the same personnel, and nothing has been added except for a change in individual raw materials, only the ideological leadership and technical organization work of the Yantai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China in the factory has been added. In this way, an alarm clock that was not as reliable as a rooster has become a first-class product in the country.
    
    According to the deputy director of the factory, the Deshunxing Clock Factory is the ancestor of China's clock and watch industry. This is still news to the reporter. It was founded in 1915. At that time, the person who guided the production of the first clock in this factory was not a foreign engineer or a student who "studied abroad," but a watch repair technician, who died in Shanghai last year. Therefore, the deputy director said: China's clock and watch industry first had practice, and then theory.
    
    The factory is currently imitating a very unique and small alarm clock from Germany, as well as clocks and watches used on trains, ships, and submarines. The Deshunxing Clock Factory merged with two other factories last year to become the Yantai Clock Factory. This year, it plans to produce a total of 200,000 clocks and watches. Originally, these three factories developed from a state where it was difficult to maintain production at the time of liberation to today's good situation. (Xinhua News Agency Special)

    烟台见闻
    李峰
    烟台是一年四季都能捕捉鱼虾的著名渔港，是美丽的“花果之乡”。
    烟台风光的确美，但烟台人民的劳动和美化生活的智慧，却有更大的吸引力。
    保险锁的秘密
    在青岛，我们就听说程明造锁厂的锁是烟台的“三宝”之一。这种锁，五千到一万六千把同样大小同种样式之中，没有一个钥匙可以互用。群众赞它为“保险锁”。
    记者以求知和好奇的心情，参观了这个厂六十多种生产工序以后，仍然没有看出“保险”的秘密所在。刘集臣副厂长说：“给你们看看钥匙图样就晓得了。”
    刘副厂长拿来了厚厚的钥匙图样本，上边没有一个钥匙图样，都是一组一组的阿拉伯字码。原来这就是“保险锁”“保险”的密码。每一个字码代表钥匙上一个齿沟的深浅程度，“1”最浅，“2”次浅，“3”较深，“4”最深。用这四个字码，根据钥匙大小及其能刻制齿沟的数字，编成三个到六个一组，字码编列成像电报字码那样千变万化，依此制出的钥匙，也就决不会相互通用（钥匙和锁心的制造是互相适应的）。
    这个厂是全国生产挂锁最多的工厂，今年计划生产近四十万把；部分锁还要出口。解放时全厂只有七个人，年产不到三千把。
    制锁工艺那样精密，设备精密程度如何呢？炼铜是在地坑里，炼铜炉是个长西瓜大的砂罐，一个砂罐用一个星期，坏了就扔，扔了再用砂土造。机器，连砂轮算上才三十多台，而且多半是副厂长刘集臣自己设计的。最好的厂房是瓦顶平房，有些厂房是二十年前盖的草棚。
    刘集臣这人，也可说是人物珍闻吧！他没受过制锁技术的训练，书也只念过两天私塾。他的制锁技术，是向商品学来的。他解剖了美国进口的锁，逐步研究和掌握了制造弹簧锁的技术（他不知道那时中国是否已造出弹簧锁）。研究制锁之前，他干了十年修表工人。修表总应该经过学徒或行家指点吧！可是他也像学制锁那样干起来的。刘集臣说，他当时是贫农，生活无路。穷，迫使他这样干；这样干，给他带来了智慧。
    二百多万针的绣花
    在烟台一个工艺品公司里，记者见识了国内外闻名的麻布绣花和绒线绣花的生产。
    麻布绣花，底是麻布，本色；花线是麻制品，色银灰。绣品多是盛宴聚餐的桌布和餐巾。记者看到最大的餐桌巾，绣有二百多万针，长达二百十六吋，宽七十二吋。一般客厅，没有它的容身之地。它可以供三十六个人的宴会之用，附有三十六人用的餐巾。一位职员说，生产这样一套，一个绣花女工要绣制十个月。那位职员把这大得惊人的餐桌巾展开以后，上面巧刺妙绣，百花争妍，顿时给我们参观的那成品库内，带来了一种富丽堂皇的气氛，但素雅而不俗。
    绒线绣花，是具有更高的艺术价值的工艺品。它的生产，需要更高的技艺。一般人，连那最善于选配色调装扮自己的姑娘，也未必能数出二十种颜色，而绒绣花线色彩却有二百多种。这些绒线，能把大自然的各种山光美景，影绣在挂毡、地毡、靠背、椅垫、女用手提包、拖鞋等等上面，可以绣成伟人像，也可以绣成特别精致的装饰品，镶在戒指或别针上。公司的经理和工会主席给我们看的世界名画“最后的晚餐”和油画“牧羊姑娘”等绒绣上面，人物风光，花卉鸟兽，都活灵活现。
    站在这些真可说是巧夺天工的独特的工艺品面前，我们感到缺少鉴赏它的知识。一种敬佩之感，自然使我们揣想着这些工艺品的设计者和绣制者的年龄和所受的训练及教育程度。她们同我们想像的出入很大，这个公司的麻布绣花女工平均年龄不到二十岁；收购来的麻布绣花大部分是出自烟台附近农村妇女之手。工会主席说，那些最好的绒绣的设计者，是一个二十二、三岁的女孩子许若愚。她大概是前几年初中毕业以后未考取高中或是她不愿再升学，而专志学绣习画的。时间未能允许记者见到这位“绣花状元”，不过根据经理和工会主席对她的片断介绍，她的性格志趣，可能类似“曙光照耀着莫斯科”剧中那个中学毕业以后立志到工厂学印花布美化人民生活的桑妮亚。
    味香爽口的名酒
    全国八大名酒，烟台居其三。八大名酒之中，茅台、汾酒、柳林镇的凤酒、泸州长春酒厂的大曲和云集酒厂的绍酒，都是用粮食做，只有味美思、金奖白兰地和红玫瑰，是葡萄酒；都是烟台张裕酿酒公司所产。
    金奖白兰地酒，1915年曾获巴拿马国际展览会最优等金质奖章和奖状。味美思酒中含有十四种中药，有龙胆草、肉桂、白芷、丁香、藏红花等等。这种酒是一种滋补品，对妇女还可起调经补血的作用。一位农艺教授说，我国其它的酒也有掺中药的，但有药味。味美思酒中虽然含十四种中药，但味香爽口，没有药味。
    味美思酒过去是由外国工程师指导生产的，酒料配方是机密。为了保密，原料进厂时，商标都刮掉。现在的配料方法，是老工人和技术人员根据多年经验总结出来的。
    公司的经理和工程师说，这个公司的三大名酒，具有“矛盾统一”的性格：香甜而无糖味，劲头大而不刺激胃口，酒性醇厚温和不烈。这也是一切好果酒的主要标准。另外，酒色特别鲜亮透明，不混浊，不沉淀。
    要达到这样的标准，首先决定于原料。这个公司的十几万株葡萄，如贵人香、雷司令、长相思等二十多种，都是选自欧洲各国优良品种。这种葡萄，皮薄，汁多，糖多，芳香味浓。魏天子葡萄的水汁，可说是红中之红。三大名酒几乎全部用葡萄原汁来酿造。所以酒瓶一开，馥郁的果香扑鼻，的确甜而无糖味，而且是不加色素自来红。
    酒的性格醇厚柔和，主要是酒的“资格”老。酒酿造出来以后，就送入能储存一千二百吨酒的地下库仓。这仓库深在海平面以下，形似十个并列的铁路隧道。虽是盛夏，我们在这里却感到袭人的凉意。这里的酒装在一长列一长列的鼓形的大橡木桶内。女工程师告诉我们，橡木含松柏醇，同酒一起，经过氧化，产生香草素，时间一久，酒的烈性渐退，而产生一种讨人喜欢的劲头大而又醇厚温和的性格。这个公司目前白兰地的酒龄是一年到两年，葡萄酒是两年到三年。
    这里的名酒，检查很严。首先是用理化的检查法，分析酒中的酒精量、糖份、单宁（含多了发涩）色素、蛋白质和决定香味大小的酯。另外，还要分析酒中的金属含量，如铁、铜和铅。
    最重要的是靠感观检查，凭嗅，尝，看。经理说，很多国家，酒厂都有尝酒师或专家，国际上还有著名的尝酒专家。尝酒专家的鼻子和嘴很有学问，它能断定酒的发酵时间和温度等生产情况或弊病，能尝出酒的年龄，或制酒的葡萄是否适宜酿酒等等。张裕公司目前没有这样的人才，他们就成立七人尝酒小组，一种新产品或一批酒出厂时，七人围桌而坐，集体品尝，而后每人给酒的色香味分项答分。
    公鸡和闹钟
    烟台流传着一个故事：一个老年人，一手抱着大公鸡，一手提着个闹钟，来到制造这个闹钟的德顺兴造钟厂，面对经理说：“你们的钟呀！还不如我这大公鸡可靠呢！”一传十，十传百，这故事传到了几百里以外。
    故事不是真的。故事反映的闹钟质量不好是事实。故事的来由是去年春天烟台劳动报刊载的一幅批评德顺兴造钟厂产品质量不高的漫画。
    又过了半年，德顺兴造钟厂的闹钟，在全国轻工业展览会上，被评为一等品。一位副厂长说，现在这个厂闹钟的准确程度，一般是一昼夜误差半分钟。
    机器还是几十年前的机器，人马还是原班人马，除个别原料改变了以外，什么也没有增添，只是增添了中共烟台市委在这个厂的思想领导和技术组织工作。这样，不如公鸡可靠的闹钟就变成了全国的头等品。
    据这个厂的副厂长说，德顺兴造钟厂，是中国钟表工业之祖。这对记者来说还是新闻。它创业于1915年。当时在这个厂指导生产出第一个钟的人，不是外国工程师，不是“留洋”生，是一个修表技师，此人去年死于上海。所以这位副厂长说：中国的钟表业，是先有实践，后有理论。
    这个厂目前正在仿制德国的一种非常别致精小的闹钟，以及在火车、轮船和潜水艇上用的钟表。德顺兴造钟厂去年同另外两个厂合并为烟台造钟厂。今年计划总共生产二十万支钟表。原来这三个厂是从解放时难以维持生产的地步，发展到今天这样的好景气。　（新华社专稿）
