    For the Country, for the Home, for the People
　　Picked up

　　Today the equipment is brand new, officers and soldiers are still like family, even if they come from the North and South, they are better than neighbors in the same street or village. Volunteering binds us together, for the country, for the home, for the people, for rising production, for a good grain harvest. Firmly guarding the borders of the motherland, maintaining peace and tranquility in the rear, not allowing bad rumors to arise, not allowing the destruction of peace. If I am given an order, I will dedicate all my strength and heart, if I am given love, I will temporarily accept it in my heart.

    为国为家为人民
　　俯拾今天装备全新，官兵还是家人，那怕来自南北，胜过同街同村。志愿把我们结合，为国为家为人民，为了生产上升，为了粮食收成。紧守祖国边境，维护后方安宁，不让起坏风声，不让破坏和平。要是给我命令，我献出全力全心，要是给我爱情，我暂时心里受领。
