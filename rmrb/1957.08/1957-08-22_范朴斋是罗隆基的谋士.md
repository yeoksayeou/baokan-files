　　Fan Puzhai is Luo Longji's Advisor
　　Liu Dai Zhang Gan
　　According to preliminary revelations, Fan Puzhai, as a Counselor of the State Council and Deputy Director of the Propaganda Committee of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, played an important role in planning for Luo Longji and directly commanding the rightists of the China Democratic League in Sichuan Province during the frantic attack on the Party by bourgeois rightists. Now let's see how he used all kinds of insidious and vicious means to launch a malicious attack on the Party.
　　　　Luo Longji's Advisor
　　Fan Puzhai and Luo Longji had a very close relationship. He himself admitted that he had a deep "personal relationship" with Luo Longji. When Luo Longji was forming a rightist clique in the China Democratic League, Fan Puzhai joined the clique from the very beginning, and was appreciated by Luo Longji, becoming one of the pillars of the clique. According to Fan Puzhai himself, in the past two years, he repeatedly offered suggestions to Luo Longji, asking Luo Longji to pretend to be progressive, to get close to the leftists, and to use Comrade Hu Yuzhi in order to "go upstairs," so as to achieve the despicable goal of controlling the China Democratic League. Fan Puzhai and Luo Longji jointly planned the political direction of the "Contending" monthly magazine, advocating publishing things that the People's Daily did not want, preferably articles that could arouse unanimous condemnation from people all over the world. Luo Longji trusted Fan Puzhai very much and talked about everything. When the counterattack against the rightists began, Luo Longji had just returned from abroad, and Luo's confidant Zhao Wenbi secretly discussed countermeasures at Fan Puzhai's home.
　　Fan Puzhai has always opposed the leadership of the Party. As early as the beginning of the liberation, he advocated that the China Democratic League should not recognize the leadership of the Communist Party. Before 1953, he once said to others: "I really can't bring myself to call the Communist Party the leading party." After the rectification movement began, Fan Puzhai thought the "time" had come, and put on an arrogant attitude, as if wanting the Party to "ask for advice" from him, saying: "If the United Front Work Department sends a comrade to talk to me individually, I can talk for a month, and if I write written materials, I can write 50,000 words." At the symposium of non-Party members of the State Council organs, he cooperated with Zhang Luo to attack the State Council, maliciously slandering that "the State Council is the root of bureaucracy and the manufacturer of bureaucracy," echoing Chen Xingui's reactionary remarks that "the dictatorship of the proletariat is the root of the 'three evils'."
　　Colluding with Fei Xiaotong and Chu Anping to incite intellectuals to attack the Party
　　Fan Puzhai published "Outside Voices" in Guangming Daily on June 5th, in coordination with Fei Xiaotong's "The Early Spring Weather of Intellectuals," actively inciting intellectuals to attack the Party. The draft of "Outside Voices" and rightists such as Fei Xiaotong and Ma Zhemin had been discussed in advance, and Chu Anping personally reviewed and revised it. In "Outside Voices," Fan Puzhai unscrupulously attacked the Party's policy of uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals, saying: "In recent years, intellectuals... many of them have been living in a state of unease." He also slandered the Party members who work with intellectuals as "bullying others with power" and "lacking understanding of the temperament of Chinese intellectuals," in order to provoke the relationship between intellectuals and the Party and incite them to attack the Party. He also said: "Today, the whole country is speaking out, so that everyone can vent and spit out the frustration in their stomachs." He was also afraid that intellectuals would not attack the Party or that the attack would not be strong enough, and said: "We know that a mute hits people particularly hard, because he usually has a belly full of frustration that he can't scold. Since he has been depressed for a long time, once he pours it out, it is inevitable that his emotions will be agitated and he will speak more sharply. This is also reasonable and should not be surprising, let alone be afraid of."
　　Fan Puzhai and rightists such as Pan Dakui and Ma Zhemin also had a very close relationship. Last year, when the rightists of the China Democratic League held a grand meeting in Sichuan, Fan Puzhai and Ma Zhemin maliciously slandered that "the Party is not following the mass line" and "the relationship between the government and the masses is a relationship of suppression." Fan Puzhai also helped Pan Dakui contact "old allies" in Sichuan to expand his influence, and actively supported Ma Zhemin and Pan Dakui in starting fires everywhere. After the counterattack against the rightists began, Pan Dakui went to Fan Puzhai's home to ask for advice. Fan Puzhai asked Pan Dakui to expose Zhang Bojun more, in order to show "progress," to cover up Luo Longji and protect himself.
　　Attacking activists in an attempt to isolate the Communist Party
　　Fan Puzhai was extremely hostile to activists who were close to the Party. He viciously vilified activists as "obedient," "brainless," only knowing how to "speculate," "powdering their noses," "specializing in making small reports," and "turning from assistants into 'thugs' who beat everyone they see." He openly insulted Lu Yuwen as a "clown." Even after the counterattack against the rightists began, on June 17th and June 25th, he twice sent letters from Beijing to instruct the rightists in Sichuan, Zhang Songtao, to use the anti-rightist struggle to attack Xin Zhichao, Xiao Huaqing, and others. Fan Puzhai viciously attacked activists, attempting to kill them all with one blow, in order to isolate the Communist Party.
　　Last winter, Luo Longji, at Fan Puzhai's home, analyzed the current domestic and international situation to Fan Puzhai, Ma Zhemin, Pan Dakui, and others. Luo Longji gloated over the Hungarian incident, saying: "After the Hungarian incident, the Soviet Union was very passive," but he praised the foreign policy of the United States. Regarding the domestic situation, Luo Longji believed that after the policy of "long-term coexistence, mutual supervision" was put forward, the domestic situation had undergone great changes, and the China Democratic League should let go and develop its organization to welcome this great change. Since then, Fan Puzhai became even more active. In Chengdu, he invited his clique—Han Wenqi, Liu Kunnan, Zhang Songtao—to his home and gave them a "situation analysis," saying: "In the future, the China Democratic League must be independent and autonomous, so it must attract more people and strive for votes." He also said: "Democratic parties have not been able to show their role in the past because the party committees did not let go. It will not work if they do not let go in the future." He also encouraged them to "contact old comrades more" and "not to be passive." Until mid-June this year, he was still using letters in Beijing to instruct Zhang Songtao and others' anti-communist activities.
　　What he did in history
　　Why does Fan Puzhai hate the Communist Party and socialism so much? His political history answers this question. Fan Puzhai was a political broker who successively served as the county magistrate of Tongnan County in Sichuan, the administrative inspector of Pingliang Prefecture in Gansu, the director and secretary-general of the Department of Civil Affairs of Gansu Province, and the counselor of the Chongqing Provisional Headquarters; he consistently rode on the heads of the people, acting like a tyrant, and living a corrupt and decadent life. Before liberation, he also colluded with Zhang Qun, the head of the Kuomintang political science faction, and Zeng Qi, Li Huang, and Zuo Shunsheng, the heads of the Youth Party. Even now, he still misses these people.
　　Before and after liberation, Fan Puzhai and Zhang Zhihe, Pan Dakui, and others gathered some bandits, special agents, secret societies, pickpockets, prostitutes, heads of I-Kuan-Tao, opium traffickers, and other social scum in Sichuan. His intentions were very obvious. Later, when the China Democratic League was rectified, these people were cleared out, and he was very dissatisfied.
　　Fan Puzhai must make a thorough confession
　　Fan Puzhai's attitude in confessing his problems is extremely bad. Not only is he unwilling to honestly confess his reactionary words and deeds, but he is also defending the rightists. When the people of the whole country unanimously condemned Ge Peiqi's reactionary remarks, Fan Puzhai publicly defended Ge Peiqi in the Counselor's Office, asking everyone "not to harm the meaning with words, and not to give them excessive blows." After the Zhang-Luo alliance was exposed, he actively defended Luo Longji, trying his best to portray Luo Longji as "anti-Chiang and supporting the Communists." After everyone exposed his reactionary words and deeds, he initially denied everything, and then tried to play the tricks of a double-dealer. He said: "My original intention was to love socialism and love the Party," "I mistakenly believed that socialism could avoid the occurrence of the Hungarian incident by infiltrating bourgeois democracy." He attempted to describe the malicious attack on the Party as "conscience" and "justice." Finally, in the face of a large number of accusations, although he had to admit that "I am guilty," he still tried to downplay the seriousness, saying: "I voluntarily used the opportunity of rectification to oppose the Party and oppose socialism," that he "joined the battle himself," and that he was "unrelated to the Zhang-Luo alliance," describing his participation in the Zhang-Luo alliance, planning for Luo Longji, and launching an organized and planned attack on the Party as "working alone" and "spontaneous."
　　Fan Puzhai's attitude is extremely bad. He must be warned that if he does not change this attitude and thoroughly confess his relationship with the Zhang-Luo alliance and all his reactionary words and deeds, he will surely cut himself off from the people.

　　范朴斋是罗隆基的谋士
　　刘岱　张淦
    根据初步揭发出来的材料，身为国务院参事、民盟中央委员兼宣委会副主委的范朴斋，在资产阶级右派分子向党猖狂进攻中，扮演了为罗隆基出谋划策，并直接指挥四川省民盟右派分子的重要角色。现在让我们来看他是怎样施展了一切阴险、毒辣的手段，向党进行恶毒的进攻。
        罗隆基的谋士
    范朴斋和罗隆基的关系是十分密切的，他自己也承认和罗隆基有深厚的“私交”。罗隆基在民盟搞右派小集团，范朴斋一开始就参加了这个小集团，并得到罗隆基的赏识，是这个小集团的支柱之一。据范朴斋自己谈，近两年来，他曾一再向罗隆基献策，要罗隆基伪装进步，多接近左派，并且利用胡愈之同志以便“上楼”，以达到把持民盟的卑鄙目的。范朴斋曾和罗隆基等共同策划“争鸣”月刊的政治方向，主张登载人民日报不要的东西，最好是登那些能够引起天下人一致指责的文章。罗隆基对范朴斋十分信任，无话不谈。反击右派开始时，罗隆基刚从国外回来，罗的亲信赵文璧曾到范朴斋家里密商对策。
    范朴斋一贯反对党的领导。早在解放之初，他就主张民盟不要承认共产党的领导。1953年以前，他曾经对别人这样说：“称共产党为领导党，我实在开不了口”。整风运动开始后，范朴斋以为“时机”到了，摆出一副要党向他“请教”的面孔，十分嚣张地说：“如果统战部派同志和我个别谈，我可以谈一个月，如果写文字材料，我可以写五万字”。在国务院机关党外人士座谈会上配合章罗向国务院进攻，恶毒地污蔑“国务院是官僚主义的根源，是官僚主义的制造者”，与陈新桂的“无产阶级专政是产生‘三害’的根源”的反动言论相呼应。
    伙同费孝通、储安平煽动知识分子向党进攻
    范朴斋在6月5日的光明日报上发表了“会外之音”与费孝通的“知识分子的早春天气”相配合，积极地煽动知识分子向党进攻。“会外之音”的腹稿和费孝通、马哲民等右派分子早已事先商量过，而且是由储安平亲自审阅删改的。范朴斋在“会外之音”里肆无忌惮地攻击了党对知识分子的团结、教育、改造的政策，说：“这些年来的知识分子，……他们许多人却魂魄不安的过日子。”并污蔑做知识分子工作的党员同志是“以势凌人”
  “对中国知识分子的气质缺乏认识”，来挑拨知识分子和党的关系，煽动他们向党进攻，他还说：“今天全国鸣放，使大家发泄一番，把肚子里的闷气吐了。”他还惟恐知识分子不向党进攻或者进攻不力，又说：“我们知道哑子打人格外手重，就因他平时一肚子闷气骂不出来。既然郁闷很久，一旦倾吐，难免感情激动，说得尖锐一些，这也是情理中应有之事，毫不足怪，更不足惧。”
    范朴斋和潘大逵、马哲民等右派分子的关系也是十分密切的。去年民盟右派分子在四川大会师时，范朴斋同马哲民一起恶意诽谤“党不是走群众路线”，“政府和群众的关系是镇压关系”。范朴斋并且帮助潘大逵在四川联系“旧盟友”以扩充势力，对于马哲民、潘大逵到处点火也是积极支持的。反击右派开始后，潘大逵曾到范朴斋家里领教，范朴斋要潘大逵多多揭发章伯钧，借以显示“进步”来掩护罗隆基并保全自己。
    打击积极分子，企图孤立共产党
    范朴斋对于靠近党的积极分子是极端敌视的，他恶毒地丑化积极分子是“百依百顺”“不带脑袋”只会“揣摩”“鼻子上抹粉”“专做小报告”，“由助手变成‘打手’见人都打”。他公开辱骂卢郁文是“小丑”。甚至在反击右派开始后，他还于6月17日、6月25日两次从北京去信指使四川的右派分子张松涛，借反右派斗争来打击辛志超、肖华清等人。范朴斋恶毒地攻击积极分子，妄图一棍子打死积极分子，以达到孤立共产党的目的。
    去年冬，罗隆基在范朴斋家里，向范朴斋、马哲民、潘大逵等分析了当前国内外的形势，罗隆基对于匈牙利事件幸灾乐祸的说：“匈牙利事件以后，苏联整的很被动”，但对于美国的外交政策却备加赞扬。对于国内形势，罗隆基认为“长期共存，互相监督”的方针提出以后，国内形势有了很大的转变，民盟应该放手发展组织，迎接这个大转变。自此以后，范朴斋更加活跃起来了，在成都曾约了他的小集团——韩文畦、刘堃南、张松涛等到他家去，也给他们作了“时势分析”说：“今后，民盟要独立自主，就要多拉群众，争取选票”，又说：“民主党派过去显不出作用，就是因为党委不放手，今后不放手是不行了。”他并且鼓励他们“要和旧时的同志多联系”，“不要消极”。直到今年6月中、下旬他在北京还用信指使张松涛等人的反共活动。
    历史上他干了些什么
    范朴斋为什么这样仇恨共产党和社会主义呢？他的政治历史对这个问题作了回答。范朴斋是一个政治掮客，曾历任四川潼南等县县长，甘肃平凉行政督察专员，甘肃省民政厅长、秘书长，重庆行营参议等伪职；一贯骑在人民头上，作威作福，生活腐化堕落。解放前，他还和国民党政学系头子张群，青年党头目曾琦、李璜、左舜生等勾勾搭搭，直到现在他对这些人们还念念不忘。
    解放前后，范朴斋曾和张志和、潘大逵等在四川搜罗了一些土匪、特务、袍哥、扒手、暗娼、一贯道头子、大烟贩子等社会渣滓，他的企图是什么，那是很明显的了。后来民盟整顿时，清除了这些人，他还非常不满。
    范朴斋必须彻底交代
    范朴斋在交代问题的态度上是极为恶劣的，非但不肯老实交代自己的反动言行，反而为右派分子作辩护。当全国人民一致痛斥葛佩琦的反动言论时，范朴斋竟公开在参事室为葛佩琦作辩护，要大家“不要以词害意，不要给他们以过分打击”。在章罗联盟被揭发之后，他又积极为罗隆基作辩护，竭力把罗隆基说成是“反蒋拥共”的。在大家揭发了他的反动言行以后，开始他一味抵赖，继而要尽了两面派的花招。他说：“我本意是爱护社会主义，爱护党的”，“我错误地认为社会主义渗透资产阶级民主，才可以避免匈牙利事件的发生。”企图把对党的恶毒进攻，说成为“良心”，“正义”。最后在大量的检举材料面前，虽不得不承认“我是有罪的”，但仍然企图避重就轻，说：“我是自动起来利用整风的机会来反对党，反对社会主义的”，是“自己凑上阵去的”，“与章罗联盟无关”，把参加章罗联盟，为罗隆基出谋划策，有组织有计划的向党进攻说成是“单干”，“自发”。
    范朴斋的这种态度是极为恶劣的，必须警告范朴斋，如果不改变这种态度，彻底交代和章罗联盟关系以及一切反动言行，必将自绝于人民。
