Xinhua News Agency Report: The Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held an enlarged meeting and decided to vigorously lead socialist education in rural areas.

The meeting pointed out: All localities must rely on the majority of the masses in rural areas, especially poor and lower-middle peasants, conduct good typical experiments, strengthen leadership, and unfold a mass debate in a planned and step-by-step manner in different phases and batches.

The meeting emphasized: Party committees at all levels must transfer a large number of capable cadres to rural areas to help grassroots organizations preside over this great debate. We must first hold meetings of cadres at the county, district, and township levels, conduct debates among rural cadres, and unify ideological understanding through debate, only then will they have the means to lead this mass debate well.

The meeting held that there can be various methods of debate, but the focus should be on discussion meetings and debates organized by production teams and groups in agricultural cooperatives. Peasants can first be allowed to "speak out freely" and then engage in group debates, or the situation can be clarified first, followed by mobilization and criticism, and then the debate can be unfolded.

　　福建将采取多种多样方法展开争辩
    据新华社讯　中共福建省委最近召开了扩大会议，决定大力领导农村的社会主义教育。
    会议指出：各地必须依靠农村中的多数群众特别是贫农和下中农，作好典型试验、加强领导，有计划有步骤分期分批展开全民性的大辩论。
    会议强调指出：各级党委都必须抽调大批得力干部到农村去帮助基层组织主持这次大辩论。必须首先开好县区乡三级干部会议，在农村干部中进行辩论，通过辩论统一思想认识，然后他们才有办法去领导好这场全民性的大辩论。
    会议认为辩论的方法可以多种多样，但是应以农业社生产小队和小组为单位的座谈会、辩论会为主。既可以先让农民“鸣”“放”，然后分组辩论，也可以先摸清情况、进行动员批判，而后展开争辩。
