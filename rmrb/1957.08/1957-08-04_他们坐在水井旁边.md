They Sat by the Well...
　　My home is in Dongguan Village, Huanghuayu Township, Huairou County, Hebei. About four miles north of my home, in a remote mountain gully, there is a small village of over twenty households. These families live very scattered, a few here, a few there.

　　Around this small village grow chestnut, apricot, walnut and other fruit trees that stretch as far as the eye can see. On the small hillsides grow many verdant pines and cypresses. On the slopes in front of and behind the houses are terrace after terrace of terraced fields. This place can be said to be very beautiful. However, there is a major difficulty in the lives of the people here – a shortage of water. Every day, they had to carry water from places several miles away, and a round trip would take almost half a day. Almost one person's labor was needed just for fetching water for each household.

　　But that is already a thing of the past. Since the advanced cooperative was established, the advanced agricultural production cooperative here first paid attention to this problem and applied to higher authorities for assistance. After the autumn harvest last year, the People's Government sent engineers and transported many pipes for water diversion. Thus, in less than a month, water flowed from the uneven mountain gullies, through the installed pipes, to this small village. And there was a well for every four or five households. Now, not only is it particularly convenient for them to get water for drinking, but they can also divert water to irrigate their fields. What a joyful thing this is! Now that the weather is hot, the people here, when resting, sit by the well, look at the clear well water, and cannot help but say: Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, any difficulty will be overcome.

    他们坐在水井旁边……
    我家在河北怀柔县黄花域乡东官村。在我家北边约四里地的偏僻山沟里，有一个二十多户人家的小村。这些人家住得很分散，这儿几家，那儿几家。
    在这小村的周围生长着一眼望不到边的栗子、杏、核桃等果树。在小山坡上还生长着很多碧绿的松柏树。在房前房后的山坡上，是一坝又一坝的梯田。这个地方可以说是很美的。可是，这里人们的生活有一个大困难——缺水。每天，他们必须到几里以外的地方去驮水，往返一趟就得用小半天的工夫。每家光吃水就差不多要占去一个人力。
    但是，这已经是过去的事情了。自从高级合作化以后，这里的高级农业生产合作社首先就注意了这个问题，向上级申请援助。在去年秋收以后，人民政府派来了工程师，运来很多引水用的管子。于是，不到一个月的时间，水就从高低不平的山沟里，顺安装好的水管流到这个小村来了。并且在每四、五户居住的地方就有了一眼井。现在，他们不但吃水特别方便，而且还可以引水灌溉田地。这是多么可喜的事啊！现在天气正热，这里的人们在休息的时候，坐在水井旁边，望着清清的井水，情不自禁地说：在共产党和毛主席的领导下，什么困难都会被战胜的。
