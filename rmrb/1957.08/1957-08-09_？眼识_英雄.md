    ? Eyes Recognize "Heroes"
    Liu Bing

    A report states: Some people in literary and art circles actually describe Chen Qixia as a "hero" who opposed the anti-Party clique movement. Adding "opposed the anti-Party clique movement" before "hero" is hardly glorious.

    People must ask: What kind of eyes do those who recognize "heroes" have? They can discover heroes from those who oppose the anti-Party clique movement, showing their knowledge far exceeds that of the people.

    The anti-Party activities of Ding and Chen have been exposed considerably. They not only opposed the anti-Party clique movement but also opposed the leadership of the Party. So, what kind of heroes are they? Have you ever seen a hero who is two-faced and sows discord among comrades? Have you ever seen a hero who secretly engages in anonymous letters? Have you ever seen a hero who spreads lies and rumors? Have you ever seen a hero who makes conspiracies and tricks? Have you ever seen a hero who secretly meets and makes secret arrangements? Forcing such descriptions to defile the word "hero" can only be something put in parentheses.

    As the saying goes, "Wise eyes recognize heroes," and "Good men recognize good men, orangutans cherish orangutans." However, Zhang Bojun regards Hu Feng and Chu Anping as historical figures; the mouthpieces of the Chiang gang call Ge Peiqi and his ilk loyal and righteous people. So, what kind of "eyes" do those who recognize "heroes" have? Let's keep this "?" for now and wait for these "literary and art figures" to answer it themselves!

    ？眼识“英雄”
    流冰
    报载：文艺界有人竟把陈企霞说成是反对肃反运动的“英雄”。“英雄”之上冠以“反对肃反运动”，这实在不是什么光彩的事。
    人们要问：识“英雄”者是何眼？他能从反对肃反运动的人中，发现英雄，可见其见识已远远超于人民之外了。
    丁、陈反党活动已经暴露了不少，他们不但反对肃反运动，更反对党的领导。那么，他们究竟算得什么英雄呢？可曾见过两面三刃、在同志间挑拨离间的英雄？可曾见过鬼鬼祟祟搞匿名信的英雄？可曾见过散布谎言蜚语的英雄？可曾见过制造阴谋诡计的英雄，可曾见过偷约暗订诡秘往来的英雄？硬要用如此形色来玷污英雄二字，也只好作为加括号的东西了。
    俗云：“慧眼识英雄”，又云“好汉识好汉，猩猩惜猩猩”。然而章伯钧把胡风和储安平看作历史人物；蒋帮喉舌称葛佩琦之流是忠贞之士，那末识“英雄”者是什么“眼”呢？姑且保存这个“？”，待这些“文艺界人士”自答吧！
