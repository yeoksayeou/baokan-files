Our Country's First Modern New-Type Locomotive Factory
Datong Locomotive Factory Breaks Ground
First Phase of Construction to Allow Annual Production of 400 Locomotives

(Our newspaper Datong 15th dispatch, reporter Gu Ye reports): China's first modern new-type locomotive manufacturing factory - Datong Locomotive Factory, officially broke ground on the 15th. After completing the first phase of construction, this factory will be able to produce 400 Heping (Peace) type steam freight locomotives and tenders annually.

Before liberation, China only had a few dilapidated locomotive repair shops. Now, the advanced socialist system has made it possible for us to build this modern, large-scale locomotive factory. In a few years, people will see dozens of neat, beautiful, spacious and tall factory buildings on seventy hectares of land southwest of the ancient city of Datong. Before the end of this year, there will be thirteen construction projects for factory buildings, of which the steel casting workshop alone occupies an area of more than 39,000 square meters, and the total length of various pipelines laid will reach 20 kilometers. However, large-scale projects will not be carried out this year.

The Datong Locomotive Factory was designed by Chinese designers under the guidance of Soviet experts, according to China's characteristics. The new equipment installed is also mostly manufactured by our own country. The people here excitedly told reporters: The construction of the Datong Locomotive Factory shows that China's industrial and technological level can have such amazing development under the leadership of the Communist Party.

The first phase of the Datong Locomotive Factory will be completed in 1960. After being put into production, it will be able to produce one Heping (Peace) type steam locomotive and tender every twelve hours, with an annual output of 400 units. After the second phase of the project is completed, the annual output will increase to 600 units. With the development of China's liquid fuel industry and power industry, this factory can also be converted into a factory for producing internal combustion locomotives and electric locomotives.

The Heping (Peace) type steam locomotive that the Datong Locomotive Factory will produce in the future has been successfully trial-produced at the Dalian Locomotive Factory. This type of locomotive comprehensively utilizes the advantages of various modern Soviet locomotives and is one of the most advanced steam locomotives in the world. Its traction force is 41% greater than the MK1 type freight locomotive, which is currently the most widely used and best type on China's railway trunk lines. It not only pulls more and runs faster, but also saves metal in manufacturing, saves coal in use, and relieves the fireman of heavy physical labor such as coal feeding and oiling, and has a much more comfortable working space than the MK1 type locomotive.

On the morning of the 15th, more than 1,000 employees and party and government leading cadres gathered to celebrate the groundbreaking of the factory. Wang Weiguo, the representative of the workers of the Datong Engineering General Company of the North China Engineering Bureau, said at the meeting: We will resolutely overcome all difficulties and build this key project of our country diligently and thriftily, and ensure the completion of the factory construction task on schedule and strive to complete it ahead of schedule, so as to fight back against the rampant attacks of the right-wing elements.

Song Yuhe, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, and Cao Xiangren, Vice Minister of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry, also attended the meeting and encouraged the workers to complete the task of building the factory well, quickly, economically and safely.

    我国第一座近代化新型机车制造厂
    大同机车厂破土开工
    第一期工程完成后可年产机车四百台
    本报大同15日电  记者顾页报道：我国第一座近代化的新型机车制造工厂——大同机车厂，在15日正式破土开工。这个工厂在完成了第一期建设工程以后，每年能产四百台和平型蒸汽货运机车和煤水车。
    解放前，我国仅有几家残破的机车修理厂。现在，先进的社会主义制度才使我们有条件新建这座近代化的规模宏大的机车厂。数年后，人们在临近大同古城西南面七十公顷的土地上，将看到数十幢整齐美观、宽敞高大的厂房。在今年年底以前，要进行的厂房建筑工程有十三项，其中仅铸钢车间占用面积就有三万九千多平方公尺，所铺设的各种管道总长达二十公里。但大规模的工程还不是在今年进行。
    大同机车厂是由我国设计人员在苏联专家的指导下，根据我国的特点自己设计的。安装的新式设备，也绝大部分由我国自己制造。这里的人们都激动地告诉记者：大同机车厂的兴建，说明了我国工业技术水平在共产党的领导下才能有这样惊人的发展。
    大同机车厂第一期工程将在1960年建成，投入生产后，每十二小时就能生产一台和平型蒸汽机车和煤水车，每年可产四百台。在第二期工程完成后，年产量将增至六百台。随着我国液体燃料工业和电力工业的发展，这个厂还可以改为生产内燃机车和电气机车的工厂。
    大同机车厂将来出产的和平型蒸汽机车，目前已在大连机车厂试制成功。这种机车由于综合利用了苏联各种现代机车的优点，是世界蒸汽机车中最先进的一种。它比目前我国铁路干线上用得最多而又最好的一种冖ㄎ一型货运机车的牵引力大41％。它不仅拉得多，跑得快，而且制造起来省金属，使用起来又省煤，司炉工人也解除了投煤加油等繁重的体力劳动，并有比冖ㄎ一型机车舒适得多的工作场地。
    15日上午，一千多名职工和党政领导干部集会隆重庆祝工厂开工。华北工程局大同工程总公司工人代表汪卫国在会上表示：坚决克服一切困难，勤俭地建设我国这一重点工程，保证如期并争取提前完成建厂任务，以此来回击右派分子的猖狂进攻。
    建筑工程部副部长宋裕和、第一机械工业部副部长曹祥仁也参加了大会，并勉励职工们又好、又快、又省、又安全地完成建厂任务。
