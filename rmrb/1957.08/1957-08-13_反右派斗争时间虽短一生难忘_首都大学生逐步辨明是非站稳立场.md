Xinhua News Agency, August 12th: Xinhua News Agency reporters Zhu Bin and Zhou Dingfang report: The reporters participated in summary discussion meetings on the anti-Rightist struggle for students in two classes at Renmin University of China and Peking University. The students believed that one of the major gains from participating in this struggle was realizing the importance of university students firmly establishing the working-class stance in practical life. Many people said, "The time was short, but it will be unforgettable for a lifetime!"

Before the anti-Rightist struggle began, some people could not distinguish between fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds on many issues. They even demanded taking a "non-partisan" middle ground. Practical life made them realize that this path was not viable. During the Great Blooming and Contending, Rightist elements in the third grade of the Philosophy Department of Renmin University of China seized upon the issue of improving the learning conditions of the Philosophy Department, which was of concern to many students, and instigated a petition. Many students signed the big-character posters calling for trouble in a confused state. Later, when Rightist Lin Xiling blatantly published lengthy anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist fallacies at Renmin University twice, and began to be rebuffed by her classmates, these people echoed the Rightist elements' arguments, believing that this was "suppressing freedom of speech," and that "although Lin Xiling was wrong, her spirit was good, and she was capable of independent thinking." Some students in a class in the Meteorology Department of Peking University also had similar ideological situations. When a Rightist element in this class raised the question of "real society not being a paradise" and advocated adopting a "stormy mass movement" to realize their "ideals," more than twenty students transcribed and posted big-character posters for the Rightist element.

The vivid and merciless events of the two-month-plus anti-Rightist struggle made them understand right and wrong, good and evil. Xu Guolin, a student in the Philosophy Department of Renmin University of China, usually focused on the literal meaning of books in his studies and did not connect with reality. When Rightist elements spread reactionary fallacies such as "socialism can be achieved without the leadership of the proletariat," "proletarian leadership is detrimental to democratic life," "Marxism is a theory from a hundred years ago and should be revised," and "the root cause of the 'three evils' lies in the system and the regime," he regarded these reactionary fallacies merely as manifestations of petty-bourgeois fanaticism, exaggeration, and one-sidedness. After criticism in debate sessions and uncovering the "background" of a Rightist element who had made these statements, it turned out that the Rightist element's father was the secretary-general of the Kuomintang Guizhou Provincial Party Headquarters and also the secretary of the Youth Party in the province. He was sentenced to imprisonment according to law after liberation, and said after his arrest, "I will take revenge, even after twenty years." Therefore, this Rightist element consistently harbored a hostile attitude towards the Party. The exposure of these facts cleared Xu Guolin's mind. Some students in the second class of the third grade of the Meteorology Department of Peking University, who were temporarily confused, also experienced the same process in the anti-Rightist struggle. The struggle made them see the faces of the Rightist elements. What impressed them most were two things. One was that when they were still helping the Rightist elements post big-character posters, they learned that the workers of the First Printing Factory of Beijing refused to print the reactionary publication "Plaza" compiled by the Rightist elements. The contrast between the two, with completely different positions, had a great educational effect on the students. The other was that a member of the Communist Youth League in the second grade of the Meteorology Department posted a big-character poster, advising them to turn back quickly, which made them vigilant.

The test of practical life made these students feel that a major issue before them was: "How to firmly establish the working-class stance." The vast majority of them came from families of the exploiting classes or the petty bourgeoisie, and the old society had a deep influence on them. Wang Huayue, a student in the Philosophy Department of Renmin University of China who came from a family of speculators, said, "After liberation, the family's economic income decreased, and I always missed the past emotionally, and became alienated from the workers and peasants. The bourgeois ideology in my mind has never been cleared, so it is easy to resonate with the ideas of the Rightist elements." This is a relatively representative opinion. When many students summarized these lessons, they all believed that they had overestimated themselves in the past, always believing that they had established a communist world outlook. Coming to university was only to study and they were not interested in ideological reform and expressed厭倦 [yànjuàn,厭倦] boredom with participating in collective life and strengthening organizational and disciplinary cultivation, which not only failed to overcome many old things in their ideology, but also allowed them to develop.

Thus, when summarizing the experiences and lessons of this anti-Rightist struggle, the students of the third class of the first grade of the Philosophy Department of Renmin University of China and the second class of the third grade of the Meteorology Department of Peking University all believed that the practical exercise of this struggle made them clearly realize that they must firmly establish the working-class stance. They believed that after the start of school, they should strengthen ideological training. Only by constantly overcoming old consciousness and old ideas can the working-class stance be firmly established.

### 反右派斗争时间虽短一生难忘  首都大学生逐步辨明是非站稳立场

    反右派斗争时间虽短一生难忘
    首都大学生逐步辨明是非站稳立场
    新华社12日讯　新华社记者朱彬、周定舫报道：记者参加了中国人民大学和北京大学两个班学生的反右派斗争总结座谈会，学生们认为参加这次斗争的重大收获之一，是在实际生活中体会到大学生必须站稳工人阶级立场的重要性。不少人都这样说：“时间虽短，一生难忘！”
    在反右派斗争没有开始以前，有些人在许多问题上，辨别不出什么是香花，什么是毒草，他们甚至要求采取“不偏不倚”的中间立场。实际生活使他们认识到，这条道路是走不通的。中国人民大学哲学系三年级的右派分子在大鸣大放时，抓住许多学生所关心的改进哲学系学习条件的问题，挑起请愿事件，许多学生也就糊里糊涂地在要闹事的大字报上签了名。后来，右派分子林希翎在人民大学两次明目张胆地发表反共反人民反社会主义的长篇谬论，开始遭到同学们的反驳，这些人还附和右派分子的论调，认为这是“压制言论自由”，“林希翎虽有错，但是精神是好的，能够独立思考”。北京大学气象系一个班里有些学生也有类似的思想情况，当这个班里的右派分子提出“现实社会并非世外桃源”问题，主张采取“急风暴雨的群众运动”，来实现他们的“理想”时，有二十多个学生给右派分子抄写和张贴大字报。
    两个多月的反右派斗争，许多生动而无情的事情，使他们弄清了是非和善恶。人民大学哲学系学生徐国林，平时在学习中是好钻书本上的字句，不会联系实际，当右派分子散布“没有无产阶级领导也能走社会主义道路”、“无产阶级领导对民主生活不利”、“马克思主义是一百年前的理论，应该修改了”、“三害的根源在于制度、政权”等等反动言论时，他还把这些反动言论仅仅看成是小资产阶级的狂热、夸大和片面性的表现。经过辩论会上的批判，又把讲这些话的一个右派分子的“底子”翻开来，原来这个右派分子的父亲是国民党贵州省党部的秘书长，又是这个省青年党的书记，解放后依法判处徒刑，在逮捕后还说：“要报仇，即使二十年后此仇也要报”，因此这个右派分子一贯对党抱仇视态度。这些事实的揭发，才使徐国林的脑子清醒过来。北京大学气象专业三年级二班有些思想一时糊涂的学生在反右派斗争中也经历了同样的过程，斗争使他们看清了右派分子的面貌，给他们印象最深刻的是两件事情。一件是当他们还帮助右派分子张贴大字报时，知道了北京市印刷厂一厂的工人拒绝印刷右派分子编的反动刊物“广场”的事情，两者一对照，立场完全不同，这种鲜明的阶级立场对学生的教育很大。另一件事是气象专业二年级的共青团员贴出一张大字报，劝告他们赶快回头，使他们警惕起来。
    实际生活的考验，使这些学生感觉到摆在面前的一个重大问题是：“怎样站稳工人阶级立场”。他们绝大多数人出身于剥削阶级或小资产阶级的家庭，旧社会给他们很深的影响。人民大学哲学系一个出身于投机商家庭的学生汪华岳说：“解放后家庭经济收入减少了，感情上总是留恋过去，和工农劳动人民疏远，思想上的资产阶级思想意识从来没有澄清过，因此对右派分子的思想很容易引起共鸣”，这是较有代表性的意见。许多学生总结这些教训时，都认为过去把自己估计太高，一直自以为已经树立了共产主义的人生观，到大学里来只是学习功课的，对思想改造不感兴趣，对参加集体生活和加强组织性、纪律性的修养表示厌烦，使自己的思想意识里的许多旧东西不仅没有克服，而且有了发展。
    这样，中国人民大学哲学系一年级三班、北京大学气象专业三年级二班的学生在总结这次反右派斗争的经验教训时，都认为这次斗争的实际锻炼，使他们清楚地认识到必须站稳工人阶级的立场。他们认为，开学以后，还要加强思想上的锻炼，只有不断克服旧意识、旧思想，工人阶级的立场才能站得稳。
