Fei Xiaotong, the "military advisor" of the Zhang Bojun-Luo Longji alliance, engaged in all sorts of sabotage during his tenure as the leader of the Yunnan Ethnic Minority Social History Survey Team. Recently, all the survey team members who returned to Kunming from the frontier held meetings for days to expose Fei Xiaotong's criminal activities.

Regarding the direction of surveying the social history of ethnic minorities in Yunnan, the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee determined that the focus should first be on surveying ethnic minorities in the border regions where class differentiation was not obvious, to study their social nature in order to explore specific paths towards the transition to socialism. Fei Xiaotong intentionally sabotaged this direction. Taking advantage of the opportunity to participate in the establishment of the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture, he vigorously promoted a large-scale investigation of the historical relics of the Bai people in the interior. Therefore, without the consent of the Party Committee, he arbitrarily formulated a comprehensive survey plan. When the survey team was drafting the basic situation and survey outline of the Kawa ethnic group in the Ximeng area, Fei Xiaotong instructed that the survey data of the Ximeng Working Committee should not be used, saying, "He doesn't understand academics, the data is garbage."

The Central Committee and the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also decided that the survey of the social history of ethnic minorities must be guided by the Marxist-Leninist theory of social development, and instructed that the survey work should be closely integrated with reality and serve the current policies and socialist transformation. Fei Xiaotong openly defied these extremely important principles. Before the survey team departed from Kunming to the border area, Fei Xiaotong, in his mobilization report to all staff members, emphasized that this survey was an academic survey. After raising the deceptive banner of "academic survey," Fei Xiaotong then used every opportunity to spread his bourgeois sociological reactionary viewpoints, either explicitly or implicitly. Regarding the cultural aspects of ethnic minorities, Fei Xiaotong declared at a symposium on the relationship between the content and form of ethnic minority literature and art: "To preserve the ethnic form, one cannot absorb socialist content; to absorb socialist content, one must abandon the ethnic form." He attempted to oppose socialism under the guise of preserving ethnic forms.

Fei Xiaotong launched a poisoned arrow against the issue of the socialist transformation of ethnic minorities. He personally went to the Dehong Dai-Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture to "investigate" the Jingpo ethnic group. He drove in a car to the side of the highway, thirty *hua li* away from the Dongshan and Xishan where the Jingpo people lived, glanced at the Jingpo villages from a distance, and then found some people to report, and then concluded that the previous surveys of the Jingpo area by the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Liu Ge’ping's survey of the Jingpo people in 1955 were all "dogmatic" and "problematic." Fei Xiaotong deliberately exaggerated the reactionary effect of the Jingpo people's primitive and backward ideology on production, believing that the superstructure could determine the economic base, and thus concluded that only by strengthening cultural and educational work and changing backward ideological consciousness could the obstacles to the transition to socialism be cleared. Based on this conclusion, Fei Xiaotong put forward the slogan "teach first, then enrich," to oppose the policy of "focusing on developing production" adopted by the Communist Party in ethnic minority areas of the border region.

People pointed out that Fei Xiaotong's dissemination of this series of reactionary viewpoints in the survey team was by no means a matter of academic thought, but was actively preparing to restore bourgeois sociology and directly serving the anti-socialist scientific program he participated in drafting.

In order to ensure that this anti-socialist program could be implemented in the survey work, Fei Xiaotong, on the one hand, put on the airs of a "ethnology expert" and tried his best to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party over the survey work and exclude cadres sent by the Party. In order to ensure the success of this survey, the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee, transferred more than 40 cadres from provincial-level agencies and schools to participate in the survey team. However, Fei Xiaotong used the excuse that "administrative cadres have low levels and do not understand the business" to discriminate against and exclude these cadres in his work. On the other hand, Fei Xiaotong searched for some of his former cronies in Kunming and placed them in the survey team. Although the Yunnan Party and government leading organs attached great importance to the work of the survey team and provided assistance in many aspects, Fei Xiaotong provoked resentment among the cadres of the survey team, saying that the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party was not enthusiastic and that the Yunnan Party and government organs had heavy bureaucratic habits. At the same time, he also mobilized the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League to invite them to go to the hot springs for outings and meals, making some people feel that the China Democratic League was even more "warm" than the Communist Party, and that Fei Xiaotong was considerate and caring for intellectuals. On the eve of the survey team's departure from Kunming to the border region, Fei Xiaotong summoned his cronies for a talk and instructed them to act according to his own set of rules.

The materials revealed by the survey team show that Fei Xiaotong's destructive activities have caused certain losses to the Yunnan ethnic minority survey work.

### 费孝通怎样破坏云南少数民族调查工作

　　费孝通怎样破坏云南少数民族调查工作
    章伯钧—罗隆基联盟的军师费孝通在担任云南少数民族社会历史调查组组长期间，百般破坏调查工作。最近由边疆回到昆明的调查组全体工作人员连日集会，揭发了费孝通的罪恶活动。
    在云南调查少数民族社会历史的方针，中央和省委确定首先着重调查边疆阶级分化不明显的各少数民族，研究他们的社会性质，以便探讨向社会主义过渡的具体道路。费孝通有意破坏这一方针，他乘参加大理白族自治州成立的机会，竭力鼓吹对处于内地的白族的历史文物作大规模调查。于是他不经党委同意，擅自拟定了全面的调查计划。调查组在草拟西盟地区佧佤族的基本情况和调查提纲时，费孝通指示不准采用西盟工委的调查资料，说“他不懂学术，资料是废品。”
    中央和中共云南省委还决定，调查少数民族的社会历史必须以马克思列宁主义关于社会发展的理论作为指导思想，并指示调查工作要紧密结合现实，服务于现行政策和社会主义改造。费孝通公然违抗这些极为重要的原则，调查组从昆明出发到边疆前，费孝通在向全体工作人员作的动员报告中，却强调这次调查是学术性的调查。打出“学术性调查”的欺骗幌子后，费孝通接着利用一切机会或明或暗地散布其资产阶级社会学的反动观点。关于少数民族的文化方面，费孝通在一次座谈会上谈到少数民族文艺的内容和形式的关系时宣称：“要保留民族形式，就不能吸收社会主义内容；要吸收社会主义内容，就必须抛弃民族形式。”企图在保存民族形式的借口下，反对社会主义。
    费孝通针对少数民族的社会主义改造问题，放出了一枝毒箭。他曾亲自到德宏傣族景颇族自治州去“调查”景颇族，他坐着小汽车到离景颇族居住的东山、西山三十华里的公路旁停下来，向景颇族村寨遥望了一下，然后找了些人汇报，便认为过去中共云南省委在景颇族地区的调查和1955年刘格平等对景颇族的调查都是“教条”、“有问题”。费孝通故意夸大景颇族原始落后的意识形态对生产的反作用，认为上层建筑可以决定经济基础，由此得出结论：只有加强文化教育工作，改变落后思想意识，才能扫清向社会主义过渡的障碍。费孝通根据这个结论提出“先教而后富”的口号，来反对共产党在边疆少数民族地区采取的“以发展生产为中心”的政策。
    人们指出：费孝通在调查组散布这一系列反动观点绝非学术思想问题，而是积极为恢复资产阶级社会学作准备，并直接为他参加拟订的反社会主义的科学纲领服务。
    为了使这种反社会主义的纲领能够在调查工作中贯彻，费孝通一面摆起“民族学专家”的架子，竭力反对共产党对调查工作的领导，排斥党派来的干部。中共云南省委为了保证作好这次调查工作，按中央指示从省级机关和学校中抽调了四十多名干部参加调查组。费孝通却以“行政机关干部水平低，不懂业务”为借口，在工作中百般歧视和排斥这些干部。另一方面，费孝通却在昆明搜罗了一些他过去的亲信，安插到调查组内。云南党和政府领导机关虽然对调查组的工作给予了极大的重视和多方面的帮助，但费孝通却在调查组干部面前挑拨说，中共云南省委不热情，云南党政机关官僚主义习气重。同时，他又活动民盟云南省委请他们到温泉去游玩、吃饭，使有的人感到民盟比共产党还“温暖”，费孝通对知识分子体贴关心。调查组离昆明前往边疆前夕，费孝通便召集他这批亲信谈话，指示按照他的一套行事。
    调查组揭露的材料说明，费孝通的破坏活动已使云南的少数民族调查工作蒙受一定的损失。
