Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 7th. The Hubei Steel Plant has begun construction. Currently, the work has started on mine stripping, water supply and drainage, and roads; factory building construction is being actively prepared.

Once completed, this steel plant will be able to produce 150,000 tons of pig iron and 100,000 tons of steel ingots annually, and will also be able to roll a large amount of construction steel; the entire plant construction project will be completed by the end of 1959, and two blast furnaces will be built and put into operation in the third and fourth quarters of next year. In addition to supplying this province, its products will also supply other regions.

The Hubei Steel Plant is located in Echeng, which produces iron ore, and the transportation here is very convenient. The small iron ore resources near Echeng are sufficient for its use for several decades. Because of the low degree of mechanization in this type of small steel plant, the investment per ton of steel is more than half less than the investment in building a large steel plant.

    湖北兴建小钢铁厂
    投资节省一半多
    新华社武汉7日电　湖北钢铁厂开始兴建。现在已开工的有矿山剥离、供排水以及道路等工程；厂房建设正在积极准备施工。
    这座钢铁厂造成以后能年产十五万吨生铁，十万吨钢锭，并且还能轧制大量建筑钢材；全部建厂工程将在1959年底完工，明年三、四季度将有两座高炉建成相继出铁。它的产品除了供应本省以外，还要供应其他地区。
    湖北钢铁厂厂址选在出产铁矿石的鄂城，这里的交通很方便。鄂城附近的小铁矿资源足够它用好几十年。这类小型钢铁厂因机械化程度低，每吨钢的投资额要比建设大型钢铁厂的投资额少一半多。
