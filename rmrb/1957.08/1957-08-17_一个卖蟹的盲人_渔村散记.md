    A Blind Man Selling Crabs
    —Sketches from a Fishing Village
    Ji Liu
    Old Wang, the head of the fishermen's work team, said to me, "There's a blind man at the market. He's very accurate with his scale when he sells crabs. Would you like to take a look?"

    I asked in surprise, "Can a blind person use a scale?"

    "Of course! He uses the scale with perfect accuracy. It's as if the balance mark isn't on the scale bar, but in his heart!"

    I was just trying to learn a little about the fishermen's lives, so I immediately agreed to go with him.

    The market in Chao Village was bustling with activity. It was shoulder to shoulder, people were crammed together, and my shoes were stepped on and came off several times. The lanes were filled with all sorts of goods and seafood. Seafood rarely seen inland—squid, lobster, and mitten crabs—filled the stone steps on both sides. I had no time to look at these, and I followed Old Wang, winding my way to a market covered by a thatched shed.

    Old Wang pointed to a fisherman-dressed man and said softly:

      "There he is! Him, he's called Yu Chou."

    Following his hand, I saw a thin, tall man, about forty years old, wearing a high-collared black cloth jacket. He wore a bamboo woven coolie hat on his head, which had turned reddish-brown and shiny because it was old. He wore a folded, indigo blue apron around his waist. He was holding a scale in both hands and talking business with a customer. Two fish baskets were placed on the ground, filled with razor clams (shellfish) and purple-clawed, green-shelled crabs. I approached the crab basket and looked at his face. His eyelids were sunken, and when they moved, you could see two small red holes. The pupils were no longer visible. It was a simple, resolute face, and a single glance would evoke painful associations in people.

    I watched him weigh the crabs several times. As soon as the customer put the selected crabs on the scale pan, he would quickly weigh them after pushing the counterweight. Then, holding the string of the counterweight and twisting the scale bar, he would show it to the customer and say, "Look! I guarantee you'll get the full weight!" The customer was usually very satisfied because he gave a very generous amount, and the scale bar was tilted high.

    Old Wang whispered to me that he had lost his sight due to the poison of the "扈鱼" (hù yú) fish. This type of fish has a thin, long tail. If it stings a person, the person's skin will fester.

    Because Yu Chou was very busy, we left after watching for a while. Before leaving, I asked Old Wang to make an appointment for Yu Chou to come to my residence in the evening to have a heart-to-heart talk.

    In the evening, Cheng Yu Chou came as expected. He sat down, rubbing a bamboo stick placed on his lap with one hand, and holding a cup of tea with the other. He looked spirited and didn't seem tired at all, as if he hadn't been standing at the market all day.

    He first talked about his unique experience:

    "In the summer of my twentieth year, I went blind, and my wife ran away with someone else. At that time, my younger brother was still alive, and he was fishing. I wanted to help him sell fish, so I got some stones and practiced weighing day and night. I measured the scale bar horizontally and vertically with my fingers. At first, I needed help from others, but later, by feeling the balance mark, I knew the quantity, and as time went on, I became more and more skilled and was able to do business. Some people even brought their fish for me to sell on their behalf. However, in the old society, disabled people were bullied. Many people cheated me by using fake money to buy fish. The pseudo-town mayor sent local bullies to buy fish without paying. When I went to ask for money, not only did they not give it to me, but I was beaten up. Business gradually became impossible to continue, and even relatives became distant. Later, I had to beg everywhere." He stopped talking at this point. He supported his chin with three fingers, his head shook slightly a few times, and the light of the cigarette in his right hand flickered in the dark. He was immersed in pain and sorrow, his body stiff and motionless. The ash fell into the teacup in his hand. I quickly grabbed the teacup, poured out the water inside, and refilled it with fresh tea to give to him, hoping to comfort him and talk about something happy. I asked him, "What was life like later?"

    "After liberation, the government gave a lot of relief money. I learned how to cook, wash clothes, make net thread, and weave nets. Later, the village arranged a job for me, selling fish for fish sellers who didn't have scales at the market, earning some wages, and I had food and drink. After the establishment of the advanced cooperative, the cooperative gave me 430 jin of rice every year, covering food and medical care. My nephew would catch some shrimp and crabs after school every day, and I would sell them, so I had some pocket money. Relatives and old friends became more and more kind to me..." He rubbed the bamboo stick and gestured as he spoke fluently. Because he was excited, his voice became louder, and a reddish color appeared on his face.

    The next day at dusk, during low tide, Old Wang and I went to the seawall to see the "mud sleds" (note). Old Wang pointed out Yu Chou's nephew to me. He was picking razor clams and sea crabs, with his head bare, wearing a short-sleeved white jacket, holding the handrail, one leg kneeling on the grass mat of the mud sled, and one foot paddling in the mud water outside the side. The mud sled moved quickly in the soft mud, and he would frequently bend down to pick up razor clams and sea crabs. As he picked, he suddenly straightened up and shouted towards the cliff north of the cove: "Uncle! I found another big mitten crab!"

    We looked towards the hillside, and on a flat slope, Yu Chou was sitting there, with a fish basket beside him. He was playing with a bamboo stick and singing the Yue opera "Second Plum Blossom," unaware that his nephew was calling him.

    Old Wang and I walked towards Yu Chou. The rugged mountain road wound around the cliff, and even we had to be extra careful. I was very puzzled how Yu Chou could get up here. Old Wang told me: "Yu Chou often comes here. He likes to listen to the sound of the sea tide and the calls of the water birds; and he says that he wants to go out to sea with the fishing cooperative. When people ask him, what are you going to do out at sea, he says: 'What! I'm not going to sea to freeload. I can mend nets, cook, and scrub the deck, and I'm no worse than you with your sight!'"

    We approached Yu Chou gently without disturbing him. He didn't notice us and was still singing happily. The fish basket was full of shrimp, crabs, and razor clams. The crabs were still alive, and if there wasn't a net blocking the top of the basket, they would have crawled out long ago.

    Yu Chou was singing—"Rain beats plum blossoms to the ground, the young lady promises to reopen the plum blossoms; young master Mei Liangyu watches the plum blossoms at night." He sang every word perfectly, without a single wrong note. Old Wang and I didn't rush to greet him. We listened to him sing while looking at the distant light yellow banana-liqueur-like seawater and watching the children riding mud sleds. Everything before us was endlessly pleasing. We were immersed in a rare happiness.

    [Note] A small boat used on mudflats, with light and thin planks, low sides, and a raised bow, making it easy to block mud water. It is propelled not by oars, but by the force of the feet, making it move quickly.

    一个卖蟹的盲人
    ——渔村散记
    纪流
    渔民工作组长老王对我说：“集上有个失明的人，他卖蟹用称很准，你要不要去看看？”
    我诧异地问：“没眼的人还能用称吗？”
    “当然！他用称不差分毫，好像定盘星不在称杆上，而在他心里！”
    我正想了解一点渔民的生活情形，就立刻同意跟他去看看。
    潮村的集市，热闹非凡。这里人挨人、人挤人，我的鞋子好几次被人踩掉。巷子里摆满各种杂货和海产，内地少有的海味：鱿鱼、龙虾、膏蟹，摆满了两旁的石阶。我无暇看这些，跟在老王身后，拐弯抹角来到一处茅棚遮盖着的市场。
    老王指着一个渔民打扮的人，轻声说：
      “这不！他，叫玉筹。”
    顺着他的手看过去，站着一个瘦长的个儿，四十多岁，穿着高领黑布褂子。头上戴着竹篾编的凉帽，因为是旧的，变成棕红色发着亮光。腰里系着一件叠着褶儿的毛蓝布围裙。他两只手拿着称，正在和顾客谈生意。地上摆着两个鱼筐，里面装着蛏子（贝壳动物）和紫螯青盖的螃蟹。我靠近蟹筐，向他脸颊上望去。他的眼皮凹陷，掀动的时候，能够看到两个小小的红洞，瞳孔已经看不到了。这是一张质朴沉毅的面孔，看一眼就会引起人们痛苦的联想。
    我看着他称了几次蟹。只要主顾把选好的螃蟹放在称盘上，等他把铊锤儿一推，很快就称得了。然后用手卡着铊绳、扭着称杆，送给主顾看，嘴里说：“瞧！保险给你足实分量！”主顾看了，往往都很满意，因为他给的份量很足，称杆翘得老高。
    老王小声告诉我，他的眼睛是由于中了扈鱼毒而失明的。这种鱼，长着一根细长的尾巴，刺到人，人的皮肤就要溃烂。
    因为玉筹的生意很忙，看了一会，我们就走了。临走让老王约好，晚上请玉筹到我的住处谈心。
    晚上，程玉筹果然来了。他坐下来，用一只手搓着放在腿上的竹棍儿，一手端着杯子喝茶，神情奕奕，没有一点倦容，好像不曾在集上站过一个整天。
    他首先谈了自己特有的经历：
    “二十岁那年的夏天，眼瞎了，老婆跟了人私奔。那时候，我弟弟还在世，他捕鱼。我想帮他卖鱼，就弄了几块石头黑天白日地练着称。手指在称杆上横着量、竖着比，开始得别人帮助，后来，摸着定盘星就知道数量，天长日久越来越熟，就能作生意了。还有人把鱼拿来让我代卖。可是，旧社会残废人受欺侮，很多人买鱼用假票骗我。伪镇长让乡丁来买鱼不给钱，我去要钱，不但不给，反而挨了一顿打。生意渐渐不能作下去，亲人也疏远了，后来就四处乞讨。”说到这里，话停了。他用三个手指托着下颚，头微微晃了几晃，右手里的烟火在暗处抖动，他沉浸在痛苦和悲哀里，身子僵直，一动不动。烟灰落在手下的茶杯里。我赶紧把茶杯抓在手里，倒光里边的水，又沏好新茶送给他，想宽慰他谈一点高兴的事情。就问他：“后来生活怎么样？”
    “解放以后，政府给了不少救济费，我学会了烧饭、洗衣服、打网线、织网，后来乡里给我安置了工作，在集上给没称的卖鱼户卖鱼，赚点工资，吃喝有了。成立高级社以后，社里每年给四百三十斤大米，包吃、包医。侄儿每天放学以后捉来一些虾、蟹，由我来卖，零花也有了，亲朋旧友对我也越来越亲近……”他搓着竹棍儿、打着手式，滔滔不绝地说着。由于内心激动，嗓门也提高了，脸上现出红朴朴的气色。
    第二天傍晚，退潮的时候，我和老王到海堤上去看“泥舦子”（注）。老王指给了我玉筹的侄儿。他正在拾蛏子和海蟹，光着脑袋，穿着短袖的白褂子，把着扶手，一只腿跪在泥舦子的草垫上，一只脚在舷外边蹬着泥水。泥舦子在稀软的泥浆里轻快地行驶，他不时地毛下腰去，拾起蛏子和海蟹。拣着拣着，他突然直起腰来，朝着嶴口北面的山崖上叫喊：“阿伯！又拣到一只大膏蟹！”
    我们朝着山腰里望去，在一块平展的坡地上，玉筹坐在那儿，身旁放着一个鱼篓，他耍着竹棍在唱越曲二度梅，没有发觉侄儿喊他。
    我和老王朝玉筹走过去。崎岖的山路，盘着山崖，连我们也要格外小心。我很纳闷，玉筹怎么能上来呢。老王告诉我：“玉筹常到这儿来，他喜欢听海潮的鸣响，水鸟的叫声；并且说，要跟渔社出趟海，别人问他，你出海去干什么，他却说：‘怎么！我出海也不是去吃闲饭，补网、烧饭、擦洗船板，比你们有眼的不差！’”
    我们轻轻走近玉筹，并没有惊扰他。他也没发觉，还是兴高采烈地唱着。鱼篓里装满了虾蟹和蛏子，螃蟹还都活着，如果篓口上没有线网挡着，早就爬出来了。
    玉筹唱的是——雨打梅花落地，小姐许以梅花重开；公子梅良玉夜看梅花。他唱得一字一板，没有一个错音。我和老王都没有急着和他打招呼，一边听他唱，一边看着远处淡黄色香蕉酒似的海水，看着乘泥舦子的孩子们，眼前一切，喜爱不尽。我们沉浸在少有的幸福里。
    〔注〕泥滩上用的小船，船板轻而薄，舷板矮，船头翘起，便于挡泥水，不用桨划行，靠足的蹬力前进，速度很快。
