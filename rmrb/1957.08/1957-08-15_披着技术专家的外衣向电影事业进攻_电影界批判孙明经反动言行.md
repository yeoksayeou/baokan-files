    Attacking the Film Industry Under the Guise of a Technical Expert
    Film Industry Criticizes Sun Mingjing's Reactionary Words and Deeds
    (Our report) The China Film Workers Association convened a forum of film technicians in the capital on the 7th, 8th, and 12th to expose and criticize the reactionary words and deeds of rightist Sun Mingjing.
    Sun Mingjing (member of the China Democratic League) is a professor in the Photography Department of the Beijing Film Academy. During the rectification period, he spread absurd remarks everywhere, attacking the Party and the people's film industry. He insulted the leaders of the Film Academy, saying that they could only be ahead in terms of treatment and status. He demanded that they resign since they were incapable and advocated "professors governing the school." He also attacked the socialist system and the ideological remolding movement, believing that the reason the academy had not collapsed and the teachers had not left was because the socialist system did not allow people to move around freely. He also spread the view that "the present is not as good as the past," portraying the Film Academy as a complete mess. He also incited Wang Xinghua and four other Film Academy graduates working at the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio to write a letter distorting the facts under the name of all the graduates working at the studio, saying how they were discriminated against there. After Sun Mingjing obtained this letter, he did not hand it over to the rectification office of the academy, but published it on his own, causing extreme dissatisfaction among the students of the academy towards the studio and the leaders, resulting in a strike.
    At the meeting, Lu Ming pointed out in his speech that Sun Mingjing's reactionary words and deeds have historical roots. He sided with the Kuomintang's CC Clique and in 1940 obtained funding from the Rockefeller Foundation, one of the eight major financial groups in the United States, to study in the United States. After returning to China, he quickly rose to prominence. He once trained photography talents for the Kuomintang's secret service agencies and filmed and collected film and photo data from various parts of China for American imperialism.
    Wu Weiyun, Luo Jingyu, Guan Zhibin, Xu Zhiqiao, Zheng Bozhang, Su Li, Dai Gongliang and others also cited a large number of facts to prove that Sun Mingjing was completely lying through his teeth. They demanded that Sun Mingjing confess his crimes to the people.

### 披着技术专家的外衣向电影事业进攻  电影界批判孙明经反动言行

    披着技术专家的外衣向电影事业进攻
    电影界批判孙明经反动言行
    本报讯　中国电影工作者联谊会召集首都电影技术界人士在7日、8日、12日举行座谈会，揭发和批判右派分子孙明经的反动言行。
    孙明经（民盟盟员）是北京电影学院摄影系教授。整风期中，他到处散布荒谬言论，向党、向人民电影事业进攻。他辱骂电影学院领导上只能在待遇、地位等方面领先，他要求他们既无能力就该辞职，并且主张由“教授治校”。他还攻击社会主义制度和思想改造运动，认为学院所以没有垮台，教师所以没有走光，是因为社会主义制度不让人随便流动。他还散布“今不如昔”的观点，把电影学院描绘成一团漆黑。他又鼓动在中央新闻纪录电影制片厂工作的王兴华等五个电影学院毕业生盗用在该厂工作的全体毕业生的名义写了一封歪曲事实的信，说他们在厂里如何受到歧视。这封信孙明经拿到以后，不交给学院整风办公室，即自行公布，使得学院学生对厂、对领导极端不满，酿成罢考事件。
    会上，鲁明发言指出：孙明经的反动言行，是有历史根源的。他投靠国民党CC派，在1940年获得美国八大财团之一——洛克菲勒基金赴美国考察，回国后就飞黄腾达。他曾为国民党特务机关训练摄影人才，为美帝国主义拍摄和搜集我国各地影片、照片资料。
    吴蔚云、罗静予、官质斌、许之乔、郑伯璋、苏理、戴公亮等人也纷纷以大量事实证明孙明经完全是睁着眼睛说瞎话。要求孙明经向人民认罪。
