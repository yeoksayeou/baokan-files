　　Xinhua News Agency, August 28th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Sun Minghui reports: The anti-bourgeois rightist struggle in the central industrial and transportation departments has seen new developments.

　　Recently, various departments have unearthed a group of more hidden rightists. Some of these newly exposed rightists are the backbone or behind-the-scenes commanders of rightist conspiracy cliques, exposed due to the cracking of these cliques. Others were "silent" and "honest" in public, but secretly launched fierce attacks on the Communist Party and socialism. Due to the increased awareness of the masses, they have also been exposed. Some units where the anti-rightist struggle was not sufficiently developed have recently exposed some new rightists as the struggle expands.

　　As the ugly faces of the rightists are constantly exposed, and with Party organizations adopting various methods to educate and assist them, the broad masses of engineering and technical personnel in various departments have raised their understanding, thus moving from observing to actively participating in the struggle. For example, at the debate in the Building Research Institute of the Ministry of Construction Engineering to criticize rightists Li Wenping and Chen Hao, almost all the engineers stood up to speak, refuting the various fallacies of these two rightists. Some engineers, after dispelling their concerns and raising their understanding, voluntarily worked overtime, writing speeches late into the night to prepare to denounce the rightists. Some veteran engineers in the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the Ministry of Railways, and other departments, after raising their understanding, also used powerful facts to expose and criticize the rightists who had worked with them for many years.

　　The departments generally adopted the form of large and small debates, combined with big-character posters, blackboard newspapers, and so on, for the struggle of reasoning with the rightists. At various debates or on big-character posters and blackboard newspapers, on the one hand, the masses refuted the fallacies of the rightists based on reason, and on the other hand, the rightists were allowed to continue to express their reactionary views. In the debates, the broad masses of various departments presented ample factual materials and powerful arguments, and many people also refuted them with their own experiences, so that the rightists had to lower their heads and admit their guilt. Although a few die-hard rightists tried every means to deny and muddle through, they only exposed their ugly faces even more. When the staff of the Design Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry debated with rightist Yan Shaoxi about "whether the Communist Party can lead science and technology," many engineering and technical personnel presented the fact that China's ferrous metallurgical design has grown from scratch and from small to large, and is now capable of independently designing large-scale iron and steel joint enterprises. This specifically illustrates that the achievement of these achievements is the result of the leadership of the Communist Party, which made Yan Shaoxi unable to answer in the face of the facts. When the Ministry of Coal Industry refuted the fallacy of rightist Wang Fuxian that "the Communist Party does not trust intellectuals," everyone pointed out that Wang Fuxian himself is a fourth-level engineer, actually shouldering the work of a chief engineer, and the Ministry of Coal Industry solicits his opinions on many important issues related to coal preparation. He was also invited to participate when the Party Group of the Ministry discussed the construction plan of the coal preparation plant. Is this the Communist Party not trusting intellectuals? In the face of the facts, Wang Fuxian had to admit that his spreading this fallacy was "motivated by ulterior motives." In the process of reasoning, many departments also compiled and printed the various reactionary remarks of the rightists into a booklet for the masses to fully discuss, and helped the masses analyze and study them. Because attention was paid to investigation and research in advance, and full preparations were made, the criticism of the rightists was more profound and systematic, achieving "convincing people with reason," not only refuting the rightists until they had nothing to say, but also educating the broad masses.

### 是非辩论愈深入　群众觉悟愈提高　右派分子愈孤立　中央工业交通部门反右派斗争有新发展

　　是非辩论愈深入　群众觉悟愈提高　右派分子愈孤立
　　中央工业交通部门反右派斗争有新发展
    据新华社28日讯　新华社记者孙铭惠报道：中央各工业交通部门反资产阶级右派斗争有了新的发展。
    最近一个时期，各部门又挖掘出了一批比较隐蔽的右派分子。这批新揭发出来的右派分子，有的是右派阴谋小集团的骨干或幕后指挥者，由于小集团被攻破而暴露出来；有的是在公开场合“沉默寡言”、“老老实实”，暗中却大肆攻击共产党和社会主义，由于群众觉悟提高，他们也被揭露了出来。一些原来反右派斗争开展得不够的单位，最近由于斗争扩展，也揭露出了一些新的右派分子。
    随着右派分子丑恶面貌不断暴露，和党组织采取各种办法进行教育和帮助，各部门广大的工程技术人员认识提高了，因而由观望进而积极投入斗争。如建筑工程部建筑科学院在批判右派分子李温平、陈豪的辩论会上，差不多所有的工程师都起来发言，驳斥了这两个右派分子的种种谬论；有的工程师在消除顾虑、提高认识以后，自动加班加点，连夜写发言提纲，准备痛斥右派分子。冶金工业部、铁道部等部门的一些老工程师，在提高认识以后，也以有力的事实揭露和批判了同他共事多年的右派分子。
    各部门对右派分子的说理斗争，一般采取了大、小辩论会的形式，配合以大字报、黑板报等等。在各种辩论会上或大字报、黑板报上，一方面是群众据理驳斥右派分子的谬论，另一方面也允许右派分子继续发表其反动论点。在辩论中，各部门广大群众都摆出了充分的事实材料和有力的论据，许多人还以亲身经历进行驳斥，从而使右派分子不得不低头认罪；虽然也有少数死硬的右派分子百般抵赖，企图蒙混过关，但是也更加暴露了他们的丑恶嘴脸。冶金工业部设计局工作人员在和右派分子阎绍玺辩论“共产党能不能领导科学技术”的时候，许多工程技术人员摆出了我国黑色冶金设计从无到有、从小到大，现在已能独立设计大型钢铁联合企业的事实，具体地说明这些成就的取得正是共产党领导的结果，这就驳得阎绍玺在事实面前无法回答。煤炭工业部在驳斥右派分子王复先所谓“共产党不相信知识分子”的谬论时，大家指出，王复先本人是四级工程师，实际上担负着主任工程师的工作，煤炭工业部有关选煤方面的许多重大问题都征求他的意见，部里党组讨论选煤厂建设计划时也邀请他参加，这是共产党不相信知识分子吗？在事实面前，王复先不得不承认他散播这种谬论是“别有用心”。在说理斗争过程中，许多部门还把右派分子的各种反动言论编印成册，交由群众充分讨论，并且帮助群众分析研究。由于事先注意调查研究，充分准备，对右派分子的批判也就更加深刻和系统，做到了“以理服人”，不但驳得右派分子无话可说，而且也教育了广大群众。
