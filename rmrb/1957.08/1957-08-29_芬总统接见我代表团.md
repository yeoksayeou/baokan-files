Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, August 27th: Finnish President Kekkonen and his wife received the entire delegation of the Chinese National People's Congress, headed by Saifuddin, this afternoon at the President's villa on the Gold Coast, a seaside resort in southwestern Finland.

　　President Kekkonen showed great interest in the construction of New China. He inquired about China's industrial and agricultural production and the Yellow River harnessing project. He said that although Finland and China are far apart, they need to support each other. It is a blessing for Finland that Finland and China have established close and friendly relations in a timely manner. The President also cordially told Saifuddin that Saifuddin's father had visited Finland as early as 1912.

　　The hosts and guests talked for an hour. At the end of the conversation, Saifuddin presented the President with a Chinese-made carpet as a souvenir. In expressing his gratitude, the President said, "I hope this carpet, like the flying carpet in the fairy tale, will take my whole family to visit China." His words caused laughter. The guests bid farewell to their host amidst laughter and returned to Helsinki.

　　In the evening, Finnish Speaker of Parliament Fagerholm held a dinner to entertain the delegation.

　　芬总统接见我代表团
    新华社赫尔辛基27日电　芬兰共和国总统吉科宁和夫人今日下午在芬兰西南部海边黄金岸总统别墅接见了以赛福鼎为首的中国全国人民代表大会代表团全体代表。
    吉科宁总统十分关心新中国的建设，他询问了中国工农业生产和黄河治理工程的情况。他说，芬中两国虽然相距很远，却需要相互支持。芬兰和中国及时建立了密切的友好关系，这是芬兰国家的幸福。总统还亲切地对赛福鼎团长谈起，早在1912年，赛福鼎的父亲曾到过芬兰。
  宾主谈话共一小时。赛福鼎在谈话结束的时候把一条中国出产的地毡送给总统作为纪念。总统在表示感谢时说，我希望这条地毡像神话中的飞毡一样，把我们全家带到中国去看看。他的话引起了大家的欢笑。客人们就在欢笑声中向主人告别回赫尔辛基。
    晚间，芬兰议会议长法格霍姆举行了晚宴招待代表团。
