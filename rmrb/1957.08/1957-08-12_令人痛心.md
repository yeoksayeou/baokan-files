    Heartbreaking

    I began my production internship last year. In the past year, I have encountered a heartbreaking situation at work.

    That is, it seems that there are great contradictions among the various bureaus and teams under the Ministry of Geology, the various bureaus and teams under the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, and the geological teams of local industrial bureaus in terms of prospecting work, and they are competing for mineral deposits. As a result, at the same location, there are two or three geological personnel from different departments doing the same or repetitive geological work. Sometimes, they even refuse to give way to each other in order to seize the mineral deposits, and as a result, they all carry out construction in the same area. In some cases, a geological team first sends geological personnel to find a mineral deposit, and then returns to the team to mobilize a large team to go there, but when the team arrives, the deposit has been occupied by others. The losses and waste caused by similar incidents are very large. For example, last year, Team 137 of the Shenyang Geological Bureau searched for phosphorus along the Bin-Sui Railway line, but later failed to find it, so they moved a large team to a mineral deposit in Jiangbei, Jilin, to carry out geological work. However, the Jilin Industrial Bureau Geological Team had already been conducting general survey and prospecting work in Jiangbei for a long time, and they had already found a large iron ore containing phosphorus. Team 137 didn't know anything about it, and was only surprised when the team's achievements were published in the newspaper. This year, the Shenyang Geological Bureau encountered the Geological Team of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry again in Shiling near Caohekou, Benxi. The two teams spared no manpower and financial resources to compete for the Shiling mineral deposit. On the same morning, the geological team of the Shenyang Geological Bureau, which arrived a little earlier, was drilling shallow wells on the mountain, while the geological team of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, which arrived a little later, was digging trenches at the foot of the mountain. I personally encountered both of these incidents. I have also heard of some similar situations.

    As a citizen and a fledgling geological worker, I urge the relevant departments to quickly correct these phenomena and stop dragging them on year after year.

    令人痛心
    我从去年参加生产实习。一年来在工作中遇到一种令人痛心的事情。
    这就是，地质部所属各局、队、冶金工业部所属各局、队，和地方工业局的各地质队，这三大部门之间在找矿工作上好像存在很大的矛盾，互相抢占矿点。结果形成在同一个地点就有两个或三个不同部门的地质人员作着相同或重复的地质工作，有时甚至为了抢占矿点互不让步，结果都在同一地区施工。也有的地质队先派出地质人员找到了矿点，回队去调动大队人马前往，可是人马到来之后，这个点已被别人占去了。类似这样的事情所造成的损失和浪费是很大的。如去年沈阳地质局一三七队在滨绥沿线找磷，后来没找到，就把大队人马迁到吉林江北的矿点进行地质工作。可是在江北早有吉林工业局地质队进行了很久的普查找矿工作了，同时他们已经找到了很大的食磷铁矿。而一三七队却一点不知道，只是当报纸登载这个队的成绩之后，才大吃一惊。今年，沈阳地质局在本洒草河口附近施岭又与冶金部地质队相遇，两队为争夺施岭的矿点，不惜耗费人力财力。在同一天早晨，早到一点的沈阳地质局地质队在山上打浅井，稍晚到一点的冶金部的地质队就在山下挖槽。这两件事都是我亲身遇到的。还听说过一些类似的情况。
    我以一个公民和一个初生的地质工作者的身份，请有关部门急速纠正这些现象，别再一年一年地拖过去了。
