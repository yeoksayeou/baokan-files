　　Hefei dispatch from our newspaper: The Anhui Provincial People's Committee has issued a circular to abolish free grain markets. Since the summer grain harvest, many farmers have been privately buying and selling grain and oil crops, and many merchants have been engaging in speculative purchases and sales to reap huge profits. In Jiangkouji, Yingshang County, 480 households speculatively purchased and hoarded more than 10,000 catties of grain. Some agricultural cooperatives, without fulfilling the state's purchase quotas, have been selling grain privately in large quantities; some cooperatives even used 200 catties of grain to make and sell cooked food. In Dasi Market, Bo County, unscrupulous merchants even used 800 yuan to buy wheat seedlings from farmers. The grain market is extremely chaotic, seriously affecting the state's grain purchase and some farmers see the black market in grain and do not produce well.

　　The above situation shows that the existence of free grain markets in Anhui Province is not beneficial to the country or the farmers.

　　Also reported: The person in charge of the Anhui Provincial People's Committee told an Anhui Daily reporter that the summer grain purchase work in Anhui Province has improved, but the completed figures are still far from the planned target.

　　The person in charge said that judging from the summer crop harvest in various places, Anhui's summer output this year is no less than that of the bumper year of 1955, and in some places, it is even higher than in 1955; however, this year's purchase target is more than 100 million catties less than in 1955. The person in charge pointed out that many rural grassroots cadres neglect to educate the commune members, and at the same time, they themselves have serious departmentalism, so concealment of production, private division, and waste are very serious, and a few individual farmers resist paying public grain. Some lawless landlords and rich peasants also maliciously sabotage the activities of unified purchase and sale. This has affected the completion of the state's unified purchase and sale tasks. The government will punish these illegal acts according to law.

　　The person in charge finally said that the work of purchasing grain has improved in the past few days. It is still necessary to vigorously mobilize the masses to report production and complete the state's grain purchase tasks in a timely manner. Because Anhui Province has often suffered disasters in the past, and has received support from other provinces in all aspects, we have had a bumper harvest this summer, and we also have the responsibility to sell more surplus grain to the state to support the people in disaster areas.

### 安徽取消粮食自由市场  对破坏统购统销的坏分子将依法严惩

    安徽取消粮食自由市场
    对破坏统购统销的坏分子将依法严惩
    本报合肥电　安徽省人民委员会已通令取消粮食自由市场。夏粮登场以来，有不少农民私自买卖粮食和油料作物，许多商贩也投机套购，牟取重利。颍上县江口集有四百八十户，套购囤积粮食一万多斤；有些农业社没有完成国家的征购任务，即大量私卖粮食；有些社还拿二百斤粮食作熟食出卖。亳县大寺集奸商竟拿八百元买农民的麦苗。粮食市场非常混乱。严重地影响了国家的粮食征购，有些农民看见黑市买卖粮食而不好好生产。
    上述情况说明，在安徽省内，粮食自由市场的存在，对国家和农民都没有好处。
    又讯　安徽省人民委员会负责人对安徽日报记者说，安徽夏季粮食征购工作已有好转，但完成的数字和计划任务还相差很远。
    这位负责人说，从各地夏季作物收获的情况来看，安徽今年夏季产量不低于丰收的1955年，有些地方还高于1955年；而今年征购任务比1955年却少了一亿多斤。负责人指出，不少农村基层干部忽视对社员教育，同时他们本身就存在严重本位主义，因此瞒产，私分，浪费现象很严重，并有少数单干农民抗缴公粮。部分不法地主、富农还恶意破坏统购统销的活动。这就影响了国家统购统销任务的完成。对这些不法的行为，政府要依法惩办。
    这位负责人最后说，这几天，征购粮食工作已经有了好转。还必须大力发动群众补报产量，及时完成国家粮食征购任务。由于安徽省过去经常遭受灾害，在各方面都曾得到外省的支援，今年夏季我们丰收了，也有责任多卖余粮给国家，支援受灾地区的人民。
