Huang Yanpei and Chen Shutong Call on Industrial and Commercial Circles to Actively Participate in Rectification
　　Welcoming a New Upsurge of Socialist Transformation

　　(Reported by this newspaper) After Li Weihan, Minister of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, delivered a speech on the comprehensive development of the rectification movement in industrial and commercial circles on the 27th, it immediately aroused the attention of industrial and commercial circles. Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the China Democratic National Construction Association, and Chen Shutong, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, issued a joint statement, expressing warm support for Li Weihan's speech, and earnestly hoped that the various organizations and all members of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce would earnestly discuss Li Weihan's speech.

　　The joint statement by Huang Yanpei and Chen Shutong is as follows:

　　Our two associations have decided to jointly convene a meeting of the Central Committee and Executive Committee in early September to discuss the comprehensive rectification of industrial and commercial circles, including the struggle against the Rightists. Now, Minister Li Weihan has delivered this speech, which not only greatly helps our meeting this time, but also plays a significant role in promoting and encouraging industrialists and businessmen across the country to actively participate in the struggle against the Rightists and the rectification movement, and to further transform themselves.

　　Minister Li's speech made a clear and detailed analysis of the purpose, requirements, policy and guidelines of the anti-Rightist struggle and comprehensive rectification in industrial and commercial circles, especially several principled issues, which are of great enlightenment to each of us in industrial and commercial circles. Here are a few examples:

　　First, during this anti-Rightist struggle, many industrialists and businessmen have a kind of thinking, that is, they believe that in the upsurge of socialist transformation last year, industrialists and businessmen accepted the overall public-private partnership of the entire industry, which was the completion of the socialist revolution, and they also passed the socialist test, that is to say, industrialists and businessmen no longer need to be transformed. This is completely wrong. Minister Li pointed out in his speech that the overall public-private partnership of capitalist industry and commerce in the upsurge of socialist transformation last year only basically completed the change in the ownership of the means of production, and the socio-economic status of industrialists and businessmen began to transform from exploiters to laborers, taking an important step on the road to accepting socialist transformation. However, apart from a few leftists, most people have not carried out the necessary transformation of their political positions and thinking with the change of socio-economic status; therefore, after the basic completion of the change in the ownership of the means of production in our country, it is necessary to carry out a socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, otherwise the socialist system that has been basically established in our country is not solid. Now, the comprehensive rectification movement, including the anti-Rightist struggle, is a great socialist transformation in the political and ideological fields after the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production by industrial and commercial circles. In essence, it is a continuation of the upsurge of socialist transformation last year.

　　Secondly, Minister Li pointed out to us in his speech the different situations of the left, middle, and right factions in the industrial and commercial circles in terms of political attitude, and especially pointed out the two-sidedness of the middle factions, which account for the largest number of industrialists and businessmen. Regarding the two-sidedness of industrialists and businessmen, there are ideological problems in the minds of many industrialists and businessmen. Rightist elements such as Zhang Naiqi and his ilk have been provoking, inciting, and even intimidating on this issue, resulting in confused thinking on this issue for many people. Now, Minister Li pointed out to us that the characteristic of the middle elements, who account for the largest number of industrialists and businessmen, is that they have varying degrees of two-sidedness in politics. On the one hand, they tend to accept the leadership of the Communist Party and take the road of socialism to varying degrees, but on the other hand, they have not basically abandoned the capitalist position, and they are not willing and convinced to hand over their enterprises, to accept socialism, to accept the working class and the leadership of the Communist Party, and they still miss capitalism. The purpose of this rectification movement, including the anti-Rightist struggle, is to continue to consolidate and improve the leftists; to attack, isolate, and divide the rightists, so that some of them may accept transformation; and to carry out a profound socialist ideological education for the middle factions, who account for the largest number of people, so that they can break the capitalist position, establish the socialist position, change their current two-sidedness, and gradually transform to the left.

　　Again, Minister Li clearly pointed out to us in his speech that in the current situation in our country, after the socialist revolution has achieved a decisive victory in the ownership of the means of production, the capitalist economy is no longer active. If people continue to adhere to the capitalist position and attempt to restore the capitalist economy, it is to turn back the wheels of history, which is a reactionary position. At the same time, under the social conditions of our country today, the capitalist position is not only anti-socialist, but also incompatible with the patriotic position. Our country is now a socialist country, and patriotism must love socialism, accept the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party, and must negate the capitalist position. In his speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," Chairman Mao pointed out to us the six political criteria for distinguishing fragrant flowers from poisonous weeds; among these six political criteria, the most important are the socialist road and the leadership of the Communist Party of China. Since the Communist Party of China is the core force leading all undertakings in our country, there is no socialism without the leadership of the Communist Party. Therefore, in the final analysis, whether to accept the leadership of the Communist Party of China is the most important criterion for distinguishing the political position of each person. Some people verbally support socialism, but oppose the leadership of the Party in various forms. Such people adhere to the capitalist position, and in essence, they want to realize the restoration of capitalism in our country and drag our country back to the colonial road. Therefore, the central purpose of this comprehensive rectification, including the anti-Rightist struggle, is to make industrialists and businessmen negate the capitalist position and stand on the working class position, that is, the socialist position, which in practice is to further accept the leadership of the Communist Party of China, that is, to sincerely and truly achieve "listen to Chairman Mao's words, follow the Communist Party, and take the socialist road."

　　Minister Li's opinions on the central topic of debate in this rectification, the correct attitude that should be taken in the anti-Rightist struggle, and the adoption of different rectification arrangements according to the different circumstances of industrialists and businessmen should all be well implemented in the current anti-Rightist struggle and the comprehensive rectification that is about to be launched.

　　Minister Li's speech clarified the principles for us on many issues and gave us great encouragement. We believe that just as industrialists and businessmen across the country were able to accept the overall public-private partnership with gongs and drums and great joy last year, basically completing the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, this year they will definitely be able to actively participate in the anti-Rightist struggle and rectification movement under the leadership of the Party, resolutely criticize and defeat the Rightists, earnestly transform their own political positions, and smoothly pass the socialist test.

　　Industrialists and businessmen across the country! Under the leadership of the Party, we must greet the new upsurge of socialist transformation in politics and ideology with full confidence, and strive to thoroughly defeat the Rightists and earnestly transform ourselves!

　  黄炎培陈叔通号召工商界积极参加整风
　　迎接社会主义改造新高潮
    本报讯　中共中央统一战线工作部部长李维汉关于工商界全面开展整风运动问题的谈话于27日发表后，立即引起了工商界的重视。中国民主建国会主任委员黄炎培和中华全国工商业联合会主任委员陈叔通发表联合谈话，对李维汉的谈话表示热烈拥护，并殷切地希望民建会、工商联的各级组织和全体成员认真的讨论李维汉的谈话。
    黄炎培、陈叔通的联合谈话如下：
    我们两会已经决定于9月上旬联合召开中委、执委会议，准备讨论工商界包括反右派斗争在内的全面整风问题。现在，李维汉部长发表了这个谈话，不但对于我们这次会议有极大帮助，而且对于推动、鼓励全国工商业者积极参加反右派斗争和整风运动，进一步改造自己，更有重大的作用。
    李部长的谈话对于工商界反右派斗争和全面整风的目的要求和政策方针各方面，都做了明确而详细的分析，特别是其中几个原则性的问题，对于我们工商界每一个人更有重大的启发。这里举几个例子来说：
    第一，在这次反右派斗争中，不少工商业者有一种思想情况，就是，认为去年社会主义改造高潮中，工商业者接受了全行业公私合营，就是社会主义革命的完成，自己也就过了社会主义关，也就是说，工商业者就不再需要改造了。这是完全错误的。李部长在谈话中指出，去年社会主义改造高潮中资本主义工商业实行全行业公私合营，只是基本上完成了生产资料所有制的变革，工商业者的社会经济地位开始由剥削者向劳动者转化，在接受社会主义改造的道路上跨进了重要的一步。但除了少数左派分子以外，多数的人并没有随着社会经济地位的改变，对自己的政治立场和思想进行必要的改造；所以我国在生产资料所有制的变革基本完成后，还必须进行一次政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义革命，否则我国已经基本上建立起来的社会主义制度是不巩固的。现在，包括反右派斗争在内的全面整风运动，就是工商界继生产资料所有制的社会主义改造基本完成后，在政治上和思想上一次伟大的社会主义改造，在实质上，也就是去年社会主义改造高潮的继续。
    其次，李部长在谈话中给我们指出工商界目前左派、中派和右派在政治态度上几种不同情况，特别指出占工商界人数最多的中派的两面性问题。关于工商业者的两面性，许多工商业者在思想上是存在着问题的，右派分子章乃器之流就在这个问题上进行挑拨、煽动，甚至恐吓，以致许多人在这个问题上存在混乱思想。现在，李部长给我们指出，占工商界最多数的中间分子的特点，就是在政治上具有不同程度的两面性，他们一方面在不同程度上倾向于接受共产党的领导，走社会主义的道路，但在另一方面，又基本上还没有抛弃资本主义立场，对于交出企业、对社会主义、对工人阶级和共产党的领导，并不甘心和心服，对资本主义还有留恋。这次包括反右派斗争在内的整风运动的目的，对于左派是继续巩固和提高；对右派是打击、孤立、分化，使他们中间一部分人有可能接受改造；对占人数最多的中派，则是对他们进行一次深刻的社会主义思想教育，使他们破资本主义立场、立社会主义立场，改变他们目前的两面性，逐渐向左转化。
    再次，李部长在谈话中给我们明确地指出，在目前我国社会主义革命已经在生产资料所有制方面取得了决定性的胜利以后，资本主义的经济就不再具有积极性了。人们如果继续坚持资本主义立场，企图恢复资本主义经济，就是使历史倒退，就是一种反动的立场。同时在我国今日的社会条件下，资本主义的立场不仅是反社会主义的，而且是同爱国主义的立场不相容的。我国现在已经是一个社会主义的国家，爱国就必然要爱社会主义，接受工人阶级和共产党领导，就必然要否定资本主义的立场。毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲演中，给我们指出辨别香花和毒草的六条政治标准；在这六条政治标准中，最重要的是社会主义道路和中国共产党的领导。由于中国共产党是领导我国一切事业的核心力量，离开共产党的领导就没有社会主义，所以，归根到底，是否接受中国共产党的领导是区别每一个人的政治立场的最主要的标准。有一些人口头上拥护社会主义，而在各种形式下反对党的领导，这种人就是坚持资本主义的立场，在实质上就是要在我国实现资本主义复辟，把我国拖回到殖民地道路上去。所以，这次包括反右派斗争在内的全面整风，中心目的就是要工商业者否定资本主义立场而站到工人阶级立场即社会主义立场上来，这在实践上就是进一步接受中国共产党的领导，也就是心悦诚服地真正做到“听毛主席话，跟共产党走，走社会主义道路”。
    李部长在谈话中对于这次整风中进行辩论的中心题目，对于反右派斗争应有的正确态度，以及根据工商业者不同情况采取不同的整风部署等的意见，都是我们在目前反右派斗争中和即将展开的全面整风中所应该好好地贯彻的。
    李部长的这次谈话在许多问题上，对我们讲清楚了道理，给予了我们很大的鼓舞。我们相信，全国工商业者在去年能够敲锣打鼓、兴高采烈地接受全行业公私合营，基本完成生产资料所有制的社会主义改造，今年一定能够在党的领导下，积极参加到反右派斗争和整风运动中来，坚决地批判和打垮右派，认真地改造自己的政治立场，平平稳稳地过好社会主义这一关。
    全国工商业者！我们要在党的领导下，满怀信心地迎接政治上和思想上的社会主义改造新高潮，为彻底打垮右派，认真改造自己而努力！
