Our newspaper's dispatch from Jinan, August 14th: Reporter Xiao Yan comments on Shandong's recent political and legal work. Shandong has recently strengthened political and legal work and legal education in rural areas, achieving positive results that have been warmly welcomed by the masses. For a period in the past, many political and legal departments were ineffective in striking against landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and other bad elements who were frantically attacking socialism, causing dissatisfaction among the masses; the bad elements, taking advantage of this inappropriate leniency, became even more rampant.

The reasons for this ineffectiveness in striking against bad elements were multifaceted; however, the blurred understanding and right-leaning paralysis of certain cadres in the political and legal departments was a significant reason. For example, they had an unclear understanding of the current class struggle situation, mistakenly treating the frantic attacks and sabotage activities carried out by class enemies against socialism as contradictions among the people; some personnel in the political and legal departments still had deeply rooted bourgeois and outdated legal views, detached from reality and the masses, relying solely on "sitting in court to hear cases and sentencing based on documents"; still others were afraid of making mistakes and were not actively involved in their work, either delaying and shirking responsibility or holding back. Liu Lianzhong, a cadre at the Gouqu Grain Management Station in Teng County, was beaten until he vomited blood in May of this year by rich peasant Hao Jinjing (who worked for the Kuomintang's Home Return Corps before liberation) for stopping Hao Jinjing and others from engaging in black market activities, illegally operating and selling cooked food at high prices (buns for more than three yuan per pound). However, the Teng County People's Procuratorate considered it a contradiction among the people and did not prosecute. Later, the Grain Bureau appealed to the Jining People's Procuratorial Branch, which only approved the arrest of Hao after a long delay. In Guan County's Chengguan District, Cao Ruifeng (28 years old) from Wu Village raped ten-year-old Feng Aiqin on April 1st of this year. After the county People's Court determined that the rape was true, he was only sentenced to two years in prison. The reason given in the judgment was even more absurd, stating that "there was no private feud between the plaintiff and the defendant, and the defendant's crime was ‘caused by sexual desire and was an accidental offense,’" and so on. This shows how terrible the confused thinking and right-leaning emotions of these trial personnel had become!

In the past two or three months, Party committees in Shandong have taken note of the above situation, and political work and legal education in rural areas are being strengthened. This summer, the Political Department of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China formed a work team of more than 470 cadres and went deep into seven counties in four districts to conduct investigations and research, mainly to gain a more detailed understanding of the political and legal work in rural areas through the current central work, and to help local areas deal with more prominent problems, summarize experiences, and also widely carry out socialist legal system publicity. The work team members established close ties with rural areas and the peasant masses, eating, living, working, and discussing matters with the peasants. They received the most practical training in their work, and many people overcame paralysis, right-leaning tendencies, and negative and passive emotions.

After more extensive legal publicity, especially after the large-scale socialist education movement was launched, the political consciousness and enthusiasm of the masses have been further enhanced. Some people not only formulated covenants to safeguard the socialist legal system but also actively exposed the sabotage activities of bad elements. The masses in Liangzhuang District, Tai'an County, exposed three counter-revolutionary cases; Bianjiayuan Village exposed a cooperative director with a wealthy middle-peasant background who had once colluded with more than 100 peasant households to create a grain shortage, while controlling 7,200 jin of soybeans for speculation; Yanjiazhuang Township in the Ninth District exposed Lian Shimao, a bad element who had infiltrated the Party and served as deputy township head. He consistently resisted the unified purchase and sale of grain and recently condoned the masses in destroying public trees. In Zhangqiu County, the masses in one township reported six counter-revolutionary elements, three of whom were criminals with blood debts. In addition, in mid-July, Huimin District held a large-scale public trial in Beizhen, the seat of the special commissioner's office, of a group of grain merchants and vendors who were seriously violating the law by engaging in speculation and disrupting the market, striking at the capitalist evil in rural areas. The masses excitedly said, "The trial was correct! The trial was good!"

The Political and Legal Department of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has issued specific instructions on how the political and legal departments should further strengthen their work in the socialist education movement in rural areas.

### 山东各地加强政法工作  坚决打击向社会主义进攻的地主富农和反革命分子

    山东各地加强政法工作
    坚决打击向社会主义进攻的地主富农和反革命分子
    本报济南14日电　记者萧彦评述山东最近一个时期的政法工作。山东各地最近加强了农村中的政法工作和法制教育工作，并且获得一定的效果，受到群众的热烈拥护。过去有一段时间，由于许多政法部门对向社会主义疯狂进攻的地主、富农、反革命分子及其他坏分子打击不力，引起群众的不满；而坏分子则利用这种不应有的宽容，更加猖狂。
    产生这种对坏分子打击不力的原因是多方面的；但是，政法部门某些干部的认识模糊和右倾麻痹思想，是其中重要原因之一。例如，对当前阶级斗争形势认识不清，错误地把阶级敌人向社会主义进行的猖狂进攻和破坏活动当成是人民内部矛盾；有些政法部门的工作人员，思想深处仍有资产阶级陈腐的旧法观点作祟，脱离现实，脱离群众，单凭“坐堂审案，阅卷量刑”；还有人怕自己犯错误，在工作中不肯积极主动，不是拖延推诿，就是缩手缩脚。滕县沟区粮食管理所干部刘连仲，在今年5月间因为制止富农分子郝金景（解放前干过国民党还乡团）搞黑市活动，非法经营并高价出售熟食（馒头每斤三元多），竟被郝金景等打得吐血。对此，滕县人民检察院竟认为是人民内部矛盾，不予法办。后来粮食局上诉到济宁人民检察分院，隔了很长时间才批准将郝犯逮捕。冠县城关区吴村曹汝峰（二十八岁）今年4月1日强奸了十岁幼女冯爱琴，经县人民法院鉴定强奸属实，仅仅判了两年徒刑。而判决书上的理由更是荒唐，说什么：“原被告两家无私仇，被告‘因性的要求所致，系偶犯’”，等等。由此可见，这些审判人员的糊涂思想和右倾情绪已经到了多么可怕的程度！
    最近两、三个月来，山东各地党委已经注意到上述情况，农村中的政治工作和法制教育，都正在加强。中共山东省委政治部今年夏天组成了由四百七十多名干部参加的工作队，深入到四个专区七个县进行调查研究，主要是通过当前中心工作，对农村政法工作情况作较详细的了解，并帮助当地处理较突出的问题，总结经验，同时又广泛地进行了社会主义法制宣传。工作队员在农村和农民群众建立了密切的联系，和农民同吃、同住、同劳动、同商议。他们在工作中得到了最实际的锻炼，不少人克服了麻痹右倾以及消极、被动的情绪。
    经过较广泛的法制宣传，特别是展开了大规模的社会主义教育运动以后，群众的政治觉悟和积极性有了进一步的提高。有的人不仅订出了维护社会主义法制的公约，而且积极揭发了坏分子的破坏活动。泰安县梁庄区群众揭发了三起反革命案件；边家园村揭发了一个富裕中农成份的社长，这个社长曾经一面拉拢一百多户农民闹粮荒，一面控制起七千二百斤大豆搞投机买卖；九区燕家庄乡揭发了混进党内的坏分子副乡长廉树茂，他一贯抗拒粮食统销，最近并纵容群众破坏公共树木。章丘县有一个乡的群众检举出六个反革命分子，其中三人都是有血债的罪犯。另外，惠民专区于7月中旬在专署所在地北镇大张旗鼓地公审了一批投机倒把捣乱市场严重违法的粮商粮贩，打击了农村中资本主义的邪气，群众振奋地说：“法办得对！法办得好！”
    在农村展开社会主义教育运动中，政法部门应如何进一步加强工作，中共山东省委政法部已做了具体的指示。
