    A Common Language
    Gao Liang
    When the famous Indian dancer, Ragini Devi, visited China with the Indian cultural delegation in 1955, neither her Indian friends nor the Chinese comrades who received her knew that she was several months pregnant. Shortly after returning to India, she gave birth to a boy. Last year, I visited her home with some Chinese artists. She and her husband happily brought the child to show everyone, smiling and saying, "This is half a Chinese." Earlier this year, I met Ragini Devi again at a reception, and she excitedly told me that her child could already say "Panchsheel" (Five Principles) and "Hindi-Chini bhai-bhai" (Indians and Chinese are brothers).
    Indeed, in India, "Panchsheel" and "Hindi-Chini bhai-bhai" have become common vocabulary for many infants learning to speak, a song that floats everywhere, and a common language for the people.
    When a Chinese person walks on the streets of towns and villages in India, he may encounter groups of Indian children, staring with round, black eyes, shouting with enthusiasm: "Hindi-Chini bhai-bhai!" "Panchsheel Zindabad!" (Long live the Five Principles!)
    In schools and at mass rallies, you often hear such songs: "We unite with each other, never, never to be separated, ah, ah, songs of friendship rise everywhere, the people of India and China are brothers!"
    Speaking of "Panchsheel," people here often recall Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai's two visits to India and his talks with Prime Minister Nehru. The wide asphalt road from Delhi's Palam Airport to the city center has been named "Panchsheel Road" by the government. Three years ago, when Premier Zhou Enlai first visited India, he and Prime Minister Nehru rode in an open car along this road.
    On a sultry evening in May, I was strolling in the square in front of the Red Fort in Old Delhi when Singh, a Sikh vendor wearing a red turban and a silver-gray beard, approached me with a cup of Indian-made ice cream. He eagerly explained to me that he was not trying to do business, but wanted a Chinese friend to try a cup of ice cream. He said that he had lived in Shanghai more than twenty years ago and had personally witnessed foreigners' oppression and insults towards the Chinese. Later, when he returned to India, he felt even more deeply that Indians suffered an even worse fate. Since then, he often thought, when will the Indian and Chinese people no longer be so pitifully oppressed, when will the people of the two countries be able to unite and drive away the foreign rulers. I asked him if this wish had now been realized. He smiled with renewed vigor and said, "Realized, realized! Now no foreigner dares to bully us anymore!" He pointed to the Red Fort and said, "Three years ago, a mass rally to welcome the Chinese Premier was held there. When I saw the two prime ministers standing side by side in an open car waving to the crowd from the roadside, I deeply felt this way."
    Living in India, you will meet many kind and gentle Indian mothers who love you as they love their own children. From their kind words and attitudes, you can understand how simple and honest the feelings of the Indian people nurtured by them are. What I will never forget is an Indian mother I met in Hardwar, a religious holy site in Uttar Pradesh, India. At an India-China friendship mass rally held in this town, several of our Chinese guests were invited to the stage and introduced to the crowd one by one. At this moment, an old mother walked to the front of the stage and called me down. She wiped her almost completely blind eyes with her worn sari and stared at my face for a long time. Her gray eyes and the wrinkles on her forehead made me feel how much pain and hardship she had suffered in the past difficult years and under colonial oppression. With tears in her eyes, she looked at me and said, "My eyes are not good, let me take a good look at you up close. The Chinese are so kind and so friendly. The Chinese are so close to us..."
    In this small town on the Ganges River, people called us "people from the Yellow River." A young man put colorful pebbles picked up on the riverbank into a cloth bag and gave them to us. He told me: Please always remember the people who live here, and always remember the friendship on the banks of the Ganges.
    Why do Indians have such sincere and simple feelings for the Chinese? When I raised this question to an Indian friend, he replied, "To explain this reason clearly, it would take writing a whole book." But he went on to say: "The simplest and most straightforward answer is that we feel this way about friendly Chinese people from the bottom of our hearts."
    In April of this year, the movie "Dr. Kotnis" was shown in Delhi's cinemas. This son of the people of Greater Mumbai, well known to the Chinese and Indian people, established an immortal milestone for the great friendship between the Indian and Chinese people during the difficult days of the Chinese people's War of Resistance Against Japan. The film tells us that when Japanese imperialism invaded China, Nehru, the leader of the Indian national movement, called on the Indian people at a mass rally in Mumbai to support China morally and with manpower and materials. At that time, Kotnis, a young Indian communist, was the first to sign up at the rally to join the medical team to support China. Kotnis did not betray the trust of his motherland. He was infinitely loyal to the friendship between the Indian and Chinese people. He was unable to return to his homeland because he used his own life as an experiment to treat a soldier of the Eighth Route Army and sacrificed himself in the Chinese people's war against imperialist aggression.
    Kotnis is a symbol of the common will of the Indian and Chinese people to oppose imperialist aggression. When I saw some viewers shedding tears after watching this film, and when I finished reading the book "He Never Returned" written by his friends to commemorate his life, my heart was filled with a huge wave of emotion. I can no longer find any language to express my excitement.
    The Indian people deeply know that the uninterrupted friendly relations between India and China for thousands of years have set a brilliant example in world history and in the history of relations between countries. The people of the two countries care for and support each other in the struggle against colonialism; now that they have all been liberated from the shackles of colonialism, their friendship is being further developed and consolidated in the struggle to defend peace and oppose war.
    The Indian people commemorated the third anniversary of the declaration of "Panchsheel" with joy and excitement. Malaviya, the editor of the Congress Party's "Economic Review," told me: "Three years, these are three years of such historical significance. The two oldest countries in the world, the most populous countries, countries with infinite great wisdom, have further developed their friendly relations on the basis of Panchsheel. They are promoting the world towards peace with exemplary actions." After returning from the Colombo World Peace Council, Senderlal, the chairman of the India-China Friendship Association, said to me with great excitement as soon as he saw me: "At this peace conference, almost all the representatives talked about Panchsheel in their speeches. Panchsheel and peace are already inseparable. It is not only the language of India, not only the language of China, but also a common language of the world.”

    共同的语言
    高梁
    当印度著名女舞蹈家拉赫曼在1955年随印度文化代表团访问中国时，无论是印度朋友，或者是接待她的中国同志，都不知道她已经怀孕好几个月了。回到印度后不久，她生了一个男孩。去年，我同一些中国艺术家到她的家中作客。他们夫妇俩欢喜地把这个孩子抱来给大家看，笑着说：“这是半个中国人啊。”今年初，我在一次招待会上又遇见拉赫曼，她兴奋地告诉我：她的孩子已经会说“潘查希拉”（五项原则）和“印地秦尼巴依巴依”（印度中国是兄弟）了。
    的确，在印度，“潘查希拉”、“印地秦尼巴依巴依”已经成为许多婴儿初学语言时的普通语汇，成为到处飘扬的歌声，成为人们的共同语言了。
    当一个中国人在印度的城镇和乡村的街道上行走时，他有时会遇到成群的印度儿童，瞪着又圆又黑的眼睛，一股劲地喊：“印地秦尼巴依巴依”！“潘查希拉金达巴”！（五项原则万岁）
    在学校里，在群众集会上，你常常会听到这样的歌声：“我们彼此团结一致，永远永远不分离，啊，啊，友好的歌声四处起，印中人民是兄弟！”
    谈起“潘查希拉”，这里的人们就常常联想起中国总理前后两次访问印度和他同尼赫鲁总理会谈时的情形。从德里巴兰机场到市中心去的一段宽阔的柏油道路，已经被政府命名为“潘查希拉之路”。在三年前，当周恩来总理第一次访问印度时，他曾同尼赫鲁总理一起乘着敞篷汽车从这条大路上经过。
    在5月的一个闷热的黄昏，我在老德里红堡前的广场上散步，一位头裹红巾、胸前垂着银灰色胡须的锡克族小贩辛格，端着一杯印度土制的冰激凌走到我的面前。他极力向我解释说，他并不是要作生意，而是要中国友人尝一杯冰激凌。他说，二十多年前，他在上海住过，亲眼看到过外国人对中国人的欺压侮辱。后来，当他回到印度时，更深刻地感到印度人遭受到更坏的命运。从此，他心里常常想，什么时候印度人和中国人才再不那样可怜地受气，什么时候两国人民才能够联合起来，赶掉外国统治者。我问他，现在这种愿望是不是得到实现了呢？他精神倍增地笑着说：“得到啦，得到啦！如今再没有外国人敢欺侮我们啦！”他指着红堡那边说：“三年前，在那边举行了欢迎中国总理的群众大会。当我在路边看到两国总理并肩站在敞篷汽车上向人群挥手的时候，我就深深地有了这样的感觉。”
    生活在印度，你会遇到许多慈祥温柔的印度母亲，她们像爱自己的儿女那样地爱着你。从她们的慈祥的言语和态度中，你可以领会到由她们所养育的印度人民有着多么淳朴敦厚的感情。使我最难忘记的，是我在印度北方省宗教圣地哈德瓦遇到的一位印度母亲。在这个城镇举行的一次印中友好群众大会上，我们几个中国客人被主人请上了讲台，一一地介绍给群众。这时，一位老母亲走向台前，把我叫下去。她用破旧的纱丽擦了擦几乎完全失明的眼睛，长久地凝视着我的面孔。她那灰色的眼睛，额前的皱纹，使我感到，在过去的艰辛的岁月里和殖民主义压迫下，她尝受了多少生活的苦痛和辛酸。她双眼含着泪水，看着我说：“我的眼睛不好了，让我在近处好好地看看你。中国人是多么善良，这么友好。中国人跟我们多么亲近……”
    在这个恒河边的小城镇，人们把我们叫作“来自黄河的人”。一位青年，把在河岸上拣起的彩色的石子，用布袋装起送给我们。他告诉我：请永远记着住在这里的人，永远记着这恒河边的友情。
    为什么印度人对中国人有着这样诚挚和淳朴的感情呢？当我把这个问题向一位印度友人提起时，他回答说：“要讲清这种道理，就需要写一整本书。”但他接着又说：“最简单最明确的答案就是，对友好的中国人，我们从心眼里就有这样感觉。”
    今年4月间，德里市的电影院演出了影片“柯棣华大夫”。这位中国人民和印度人民都很熟悉的大孟买市人民的儿子，在中国人民艰苦抗战的日子里，为印中人民的伟大友谊立下了不朽的里程碑。影片告诉我们，当日本帝国主义者侵入中国，印度民族运动领袖尼赫鲁在孟买的群众大会上号召印度人民在道义上和人力物力上支援中国。当时，年青的印度共产党员柯棣华在大会上第一个报了名，参加了支援中国的医疗队。柯棣华没有辜负他的祖国的嘱托。他无限地忠实于印中人民的友谊。他没能回到他的祖国，因为他为了治疗一个八路军战士，用自己的生命作了试验，牺牲在中国人民反抗帝国主义侵略的战争中了。
    柯棣华是印中两国人民反对帝国主义侵略的共同意志的象征。当我看到一些观众看完了这部影片而流泪的时候，当我读完他的朋友为纪念他的一生而写的“他永未归来”这本书的时候，我的心胸，被激情的巨浪充塞。我再找不到任何语言能说明我的激动的心情。
    印度人民深切地知道，印中两国之间几千年来连绵不绝的友好的联系，在世界历史中，在国与国之间的关系史上，树立了辉煌的榜样。两国人民，在反对殖民主义的斗争中互相关心，互相支持；如今，他们都从殖民主义的枷锁解放出来，在保卫和平、反对战争的斗争中，他们的友情正在进一步地得到发展和巩固。
    印度人民怀着欢欣激动的心情纪念了“潘查希拉”宣言发表的三周年。国大党“经济评论”的主编马拉维亚曾对我这样说：“三年了，这是多么具有历史意义的三年。世界上两个最古老的国家，人口最多的国家，具有无穷的伟大智慧的国家，在潘查希拉的基础上，进一步发展了他们的友好关系。他们以模范的行动，推动着世界走向和平。”印中友好协会主席森德拉尔老人参加科伦坡世界和平理事会回来以后，一看到我就异常兴奋地说：“在这次和平大会上，几乎所有代表都在演说中谈到潘查希拉。潘查希拉同和平已经是不可分割的了。它不仅是印度的语言，不仅是中国的语言，而且是世界上共同的语言了。
