Xinhua News Agency, August 30th. Our country's first factory for manufacturing synthetic fibers (i.e., nylon) – the state-owned Beijing Synthetic Fiber Factory – began construction on the 25th of this month. This factory was designed with the help of the German Democratic Republic to meet world-class standards, and the mechanical equipment is also being supplied by them. It is expected to be completed and put into production in 1959, at which time it will be able to produce more than 380 tons of synthetic fiber annually.

The synthetic fiber produced by this factory is made from raw materials such as by-products of coal coking through chemical polymerization, and can be used to make nylon stockings and clothing, as well as various industrial products. This synthetic fiber is light, soft, strong, heat-resistant, light-resistant, mildew-resistant, and moth-proof. It is one of the most advanced chemical fibers. A pair of synthetic fiber stockings can generally be worn for longer than five pairs of cotton socks. This factory has an experimental nature. After completion, it will trial-produce various specifications of synthetic fibers, accumulate technical data, and train technical personnel to lay the foundation for the development of China's synthetic fiber industry.

    为发展尼龙工业打下基础
　　第一座合成纤维厂在京兴建
    新华社30日讯　我国第一座制造合成纤维（即尼龙）的工厂——国营北京合成纤维厂已在本月25日动工兴建。这个工厂是德意志民主共和国按照世界第一流水平帮助我国设计的，机械设备也都是他们供给的，预计在1959年建成投入生产以后，每年可以生产合成纤维三百八十多吨。
    这个工厂生产的合成纤维，是用煤焦的副产品等原料经过化学聚合方法制成的，可以做玻璃丝袜和衣料，也可以做各种工业用品。这种合成纤维轻软、结实，有耐热、耐光、不生霉和不为虫蛀等优点，是化学纤维中最先进的一种。一双合成纤维袜子的穿用时间，一般要比五双棉织袜还长。这个工厂带有试验性质，建成以后将试制各种规格的合成纤维，积累技术资料和培养技术人才，为我国发展合成纤维工业打下基础。
