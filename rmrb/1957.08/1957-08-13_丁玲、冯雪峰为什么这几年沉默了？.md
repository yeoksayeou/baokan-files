    "Why Have Ding Ling and Feng Xuefeng Been Silent These Past Few Years?"
    Zhuang Nong
    This was originally a topic proposed by Wenhui Daily reporter Yao Fangzao (see the People's Daily report on the Ding Chen anti-Party clique on August 7th). I haven't seen the article yet, and the topic is still hanging there, so I'll borrow it presumptuously.
    "Why Have Ding Ling and Feng Xuefeng Been Silent These Past Few Years?" Feng Xuefeng is tentatively set aside. The remaining answer is: Ding Ling, because she can't focus on two things at once, is completely busy carrying out all kinds of anti-Party activities. Some people will ask: Hasn't the Ding Chen clique existed for fifteen years? Why weren't they silent in the past few years, and only became silent in these past few years?
    I think there are two reasons why they weren't silent in the past few years: First, Ding Ling needed to accumulate and expand her anti-Party capital. Second, at that time, Ding Chen and others had less capital, and the traces of their anti-Party activities were not as obvious as they are now. Therefore, their activities had not yet encountered any suppression or attacks. For them, it was a relatively smooth situation, so there was no need to be silent.
    Have they been silent these past few years? The answer is both no and yes. They have not actually been silent for a moment. Haven't they been secretly and frequently meeting? Haven't they been inquiring and inciting everywhere? But because they have ulterior motives, they don't dare to be blatant. However, as far as speaking publicly to the people is concerned, they have been silent after all. The increasing anti-Party ambition and the setbacks in anti-Party activities have made them more nervous in engaging in secret anti-Party activities. On the one hand, they have to bear the burden of mental oppression, which makes them both unwilling and unable to make public shouts again. Anti-Party elements are not reconciled to this "silence." As long as there is a suitable climate, they will become rampant. After the Hungarian incident last year, didn't they already "move around" and even "spread sensational rumors"? This spring, didn't they further take advantage of the opportunity for rightists to attack the Party and turn to launch a large-scale attack on the Party? When have they been "silent"!
    My answer ends here. The original proposer's intention may have been to draw the following conclusion: that the Party's "sectarianism" and "dogmatism" have oppressed them into silence, and to use this to start a fire that burns the sky. However, the facts have made a different answer, even extinguishing the sparks spread by the proposer. What can be done about it?
    However, my article is not finished yet. Since I borrowed the "topic," I must "elaborate" on it.
    An active fighter always "emits light and heat to the best of their ability." He will never be silent at any time. This goes without saying. All kinds of conspirators are never willing to be silent, but when they are not satisfied, they always have to temporarily silence themselves on the surface, so-called "assessing the direction and waiting for the opportunity." During this period, they always appear depressed and melancholy. They also deliberately want some uninformed masses to notice this abnormal "silence," thereby creating an atmosphere conducive to spreading rumors and slanders. The activities of the Ding Chen clique show this; the behavior of many rightists further proves this. Haven't we already seen that many so-called "scholars," "professors," and "technical experts" always hang the signboard of "not interfering in politics" after liberation, expressing excessive indifference to politics; but once the dark clouds fill the sky and evil winds rise, they immediately transform into the most enthusiastic figures in political activities, baring their fangs and brandishing their claws, dominating the situation. Those so-called "not interfering in politics" in the past were just waiting for an opportunity. Of course, those who are truly enthusiastic about academic research and therefore appear to participate less in political activities on the surface cannot be compared with this category. They are never silent either.
    Of course, there is a fairly common phenomenon: in the long journey of upward development in life, there are constantly temporary "silent" "curves." This "silence" indicates the emergence of a contradiction. Most people correctly overcome it and move forward, while a few develop into careerists. Then, "Why has Feng Xuefeng been silent?" To which kind of "silence" does he belong? It is better for him to give the answer himself.

### “丁玲、冯雪峰为什么这几年沉默了？”

    “丁玲、冯雪峰为什么这几年沉默了？”
    庄农
    这原是文汇报记者姚芳藻拟的一个题目（见8月7日人民日报关于丁陈反党集团的消息）。一直没有看到文章，题目还悬在那里，我便不揣冒昧借来一用。
    “丁玲、冯雪峰为什么这几年沉默了？”冯雪峰姑且存疑。余下的答案便是：丁玲，因为一心不能二用，完全忙于进行各种各样的反党活动了。有人会问：丁、陈集团不是已存在十五年之久了吗？为什么前几年他们不沉默，这几年才沉默了呢？
    前几年他们没有沉默，我想这原因有二：一，丁玲需要积累和扩大她反党的资本，二，当时丁陈等资本还少，他们反党活动的形迹也就没有后来这样显露，因而他们的活动就还没有遭遇什么压制和打击，对他们来说，是一种较为顺利的局面，这是无需沉默的。
    这几年是不是沉默了呢？答曰又不沉默又沉默。他们实际上并没有沉默过一刻。他们不是偷偷地而又频繁地相约往来吗？他们不是到处打听、到处煽动吗？但因有着不可告人的目的，也就不敢明目张胆而已。然而，就公开向人民说话这一面来说，他们毕竟又是沉默了的。反党野心的与日俱增和反党活动上的挫折，使他们更紧张地从事反党的秘密活动，一方面又不得不肩负着精神压抑的重担，这就使他们既无心也无力于再作公开的呐喊了。对于这种“沉默”，反党分子是不甘心的，只要有了适合的气候，他们便要嚣张起来，去年匈牙利事件以后，他们不就已“四处活动”，甚而“散布耸人听闻的谰言”来了吗？今春，他们不是更进一步利用右派分子向党进攻的机会，转而大举向党进攻了吗？他们何尝在“沉默”！
    我的答案就此结束。原命题者的本意，也许想要得出如下的结论：党内的“宗派主义”和“教条主义”，压迫得他们沉默了。借此想放起一把烧天之火来。然而事实却作出了另外的答案，竟使命题者散布的火种都要熄灭。这又有什么法子呢？
    然而我的文章却还没有作完，既然借了“题”，总要“发挥”一下的。
    一个积极的斗士，总是“有一分热发一分光”的。任何时候，他都不会沉默。这是勿庸多说的了。所有各形各色的阴谋分子，也是从来不甘沉默的，但他们在不遂心的时候，却又总是要表面上暂时沉默下来，所谓“窥测方向，等待时机”，这期间他们总显得消沉而又抑郁。他们也故意想让一些不明真相的群众觉察到这种不正常的“沉默”，从而制造出有利于他们散布的流言蜚语的空气。丁陈集团的活动表明了这一点；许多右派分子们的行为更是证明了这一点。我们不是已经看到过：许多所谓“学者”、“教授”、“技术专家”，在解放后总是挂着“不过问政治”的招牌，表示对政治过分的冷淡；可是一旦黑云弥空邪风突起的时候，他们就立刻一变而成为最热心于政治活动的人物而张牙舞爪，叱咤风云。过去的所谓“不过问政治”者，原不过是等待时机而已。当然，那些真正热心于学术研究因而表面上看来参加政治活动较少的人，是不能与此类比的。他们也从不沉默。
    当然，有一种相当普遍的现象，在人生向上发展的长途中，不断有暂时“沉默”的“曲线”。这种“沉默”表明一种矛盾的产生，多数人正确克服它前进了，而少数人则发展成为野心家。那末，“冯雪峰为什么沉默了呢？”他是属于那一种“沉默”呢？这答案还是由他自己来作的好。
