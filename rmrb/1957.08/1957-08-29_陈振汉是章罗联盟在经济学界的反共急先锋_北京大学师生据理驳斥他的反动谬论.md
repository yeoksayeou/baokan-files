Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Faculty, students, and members of the China Democratic League branch at Peking University have recently held a series of conferences to expose and criticize Chen Zhenhan, a henchman of the Zhang-Luo Alliance in their attack on Marxist-Leninist economics and the nation's economic work, for his anti-Communist and anti-socialist conspiracies.

It was revealed that Chen Zhenhan was recruited by Luo Longji as early as 1953. In 1956, at a banquet on intellectual issues held by Luo Longji, Chen Zhenhan cited the example of several economics professors at Nankai University (who have now been exposed as rightists) not teaching courses, saying that the Communist Party was "improperly using intellectuals." Following this, Fei Xiaotong visited Chen Zhenhan at Peking University to collude. Chen Zhenhan admitted that he had discussed the issue of bourgeois economists not being valued with Fei Xiaotong at that time, and Fei Xiaotong urged him to "fight for it." From then on, he launched a reactionary campaign to restore bourgeois economics. At the "Symposium on Responding to the Party's Call to March Towards Science" convened by the Peking University Economics Department's Trade Union Committee, Chen Zhenhan put forward the "Social Science Uselessness Theory," "Potential Exhaustion Theory," and "Where is the International Level Theory," attacking the Communist Party and Marxism-Leninism. The so-called "Social Science Uselessness Theory" was actually denigrating the uselessness of Marxism-Leninism. Chen Zhenhan said: "Although I have mobilized students in the political economy major of the Economics Department to love their major, I myself do not recognize what use Marxist-Leninist political economics has for national construction." He believed that bourgeois economics and bourgeois economists were not valued, resulting in their being unable to use their talents. The so-called "Potential Exhaustion Theory" and "Where is the International Level Theory" were actually opposing the study of Marxism-Leninism and opposing ideological remolding, and also obliterating the achievements of the Soviet Union in social sciences.

After the start of the Great Blooming and Contending, Wu Chunxuan, a confidant of the Zhang-Luo Alliance, came to Peking University to convey the conspiracy of the two rightist ringleaders Zhang and Luo to establish a finance and economics research committee and their intention to invite Chen Zhenhan to participate. Thereupon, Chen Zhenhan gathered five people, including Peking University professor Xu Yuhan, and held two forums, writing "Some Opinions on Current Economic Science Work," blatantly demanding the restoration of bourgeois economics.

After Chen Zhenhan's three fallacies of the "Social Science Uselessness Theory" were published, Fei Xiaotong came to personally direct the promotion of these private goods within the Peking University branch of the China Democratic League, and also wanted to place these private goods in the central publications of the China Democratic League to incite members nationwide to discuss them. During this time, Chen Zhenhan actively expanded his influence, developing twelve new members in three months, including four in the Economics Department. The rightist Wang Tieya was admitted to the League by him this year. He also proposed to the administrative leaders of the department that a dozen bourgeois "economists" who were unwilling to undergo ideological remolding be brought to Peking University to work. Rightists such as Qian Duansheng had also already decided internally that when the "Peking University Law School" was established in the future, Chen Zhenhan would serve as the head of the Economics Department.

Chen Zhenhan also faithfully and actively implemented the plans of the Zhang-Luo Alliance in opposing the socialist system and usurping the Communist Party's leadership over universities and scientific undertakings. At various symposiums at Peking University, he and rightists such as Tao Dayong (Tao was Chen Zhenhan's student) arrogantly clamored that "the Communist Party cannot lead universities." He first said that "the Party's leadership is not equal to Party members directly doing administrative work," and that "in the future, the Party's leadership should be conducted through guidelines, policies, ideological education, etc."; later, he said that "it is inappropriate for the school's staffing to be handed over to the personnel department, it should be handed over to scientists, and the same goes for funding and equipment," and that "the Party's leadership is carried out on the one hand through scientists and on the other hand through ideological leadership"; finally, he said that "ideological education work cannot be left to the Party alone, the Party has reached the end of its rope in ideological work." It is not difficult to understand that Chen Zhenhan's fallacies were actually intended to hand over all weapons to the bourgeois rightists.

Chen Zhenhan also fabricated a set of absurd and unparalleled strange theories for the restoration of the capitalist system. He first slandered democratic centralism, saying that "there is no way to prevent errors from democratic centralism"; later, he bluntly said: "The democracy and freedom under the capitalist system are broader than the democracy and freedom under the people's democratic dictatorship, because bourgeois countries still allow the Communist Party to exist and have freedom of publication and speech, but we are not like that." "Capitalism has free competition, which can balance countless small deviations, but the socialist system is different, so bureaucracy under the socialist system is more serious than under capitalism." At several criticism meetings, teachers in the Economics Department refuted Chen Zhenhan's reactionary fallacies with many facts.

Prior to this, teachers in the Economics Department of Peking University and the Peking University branch of the China Democratic League held seven small meetings to fight against Chen Zhenhan's anti-Communist words and deeds. Chen Zhenhan's attitude was very dishonest, and he said that his problem was an ideological problem, not a political problem. After many teachers refuted him with reason, he said: "I myself can't explain why there are so many viciously attacking the Party's remarks."

### 陈振汉是章罗联盟在经济学界的反共急先锋  北京大学师生据理驳斥他的反动谬论

　　陈振汉是章罗联盟在经济学界的反共急先锋
    北京大学师生据理驳斥他的反动谬论
    据新华社讯　北京大学经济系的师生和民盟北京大学支部的盟员近日连续举行大会，揭露和批判章罗联盟向马列主义经济学和国家经济工作进攻的一位干将——陈振汉的反共反社会主义阴谋。
    据揭发，陈振汉早在1953年就已被罗隆基网罗于门下。1956年，陈振汉在罗隆基举行的一次谈知识分子问题的宴会上，曾以南开大学的几个经济学教授（现已揭露出来都是右派分子）没有开课为例，说共产党“对知识分子使用不当”。接着，费孝通就来北京大学登门拜访陈振汉，进行串联活动。陈振汉承认，他在那时候就和费孝通谈到资产阶级经济学家不被重视的问题，费孝通叫他起来“力争”。从那以后，他就展开了资产阶级经济学复辟的反动活动。在北京大学经济系工会委员会召开的“响应党的号召向科学进军的座谈会”上，陈振汉提出了“社会科学无用论”、“潜力竭蹶论”及“国际水平何在论”，向共产党向马列主义进攻。所谓“社会科学无用论”，实际上是诋毁马列主义无用。陈振汉说：“尽管我向经济系政治经济专业的学生动员过热爱自己的专业，但我自己却不认识马列主义政治经济学对国家建设有什么用处”。他认为，资产阶级经济学和资产阶级经济学家得不到重视，结果是无用武之地。所谓“潜力竭蹶论”及“国际水平何在论”，实际上是反对学习马列主义，反对思想改造，并且抹煞苏联在社会科学方面的成就。
    大鸣大放开始后，章罗联盟的亲信吴春选来到北京大学，传达了章罗两个右派头子要搞财经研究委员会并拟请陈振汉参加的阴谋。于是陈振汉就拉了北大教授徐毓枬等五人举行两次座谈，写成了“我们对于当前经济科学工作的一些意见”，明目张胆要求资产阶级经济学复辟。
      陈振汉“社会科学无用论”这三个谬论发表出来后，费孝通又来亲自指挥在民盟北大支部推销这批私货，还要把这些私货放在民盟中央的刊物上，煽动全国盟员来讨论。在这时间，陈振汉积极扩大自己势力，在三个月时间内发展了十二个盟员，在经济系就发展了四个盟员。右派分子王铁崖就是今年由他发展入盟的。他又向系行政领导提出，要把十几个不愿意进行思想改造的资产阶级“经济学者”拉到北大来工作。钱端升等右派分子也已内定将来“北大法学院”成立时，由陈振汉担任经济系主任。
    陈振汉在反对社会主义制度、篡夺共产党对高等学校和科学事业的领导权等方面，也忠实地积极地执行了章罗联盟的计划。他在北京大学的各种座谈会上，和右派分子陶大镛（陶是陈振汉的学生）等同样狂妄地叫嚣“共产党不能够领导高等学校”。他先说“党的领导不等于党员直接作行政工作”，“将来党的领导应通过方针政策、思想教育等进行”；后来又说“学校的编制交人事部门不妥当，应该交给科学家，经费仪器也如此”，“党的领导一方面通过科学家，一方面通过思想领导”；最后又说“思想教育工作也不能只交给党了，党对思想工作已到山穷水尽的地步”。不难理解，陈振汉的这些谬论实际上就是要共产党把全部武器交给资产阶级右派。
    陈振汉还制造了一套荒谬绝伦的使资本主义制度复辟的怪论。他首先污蔑民主集中制，说“要从民主集中制来防止错误是没有办法的”；后来又露骨地说：“资本主义制度下的民主自由比人民民主专政下的民主自由要广，因为资产阶级国家还允许共产党存在，有出版言论自由，我们却不是这样。”“资本主义有自由竞争，可以使无数小的偏差得到平衡，而社会主义制度下却不同，因此社会主义制度下官僚主义比资本主义下还严重。”在几次批判会上，经济系的教师们用许多事实驳斥了陈振汉的这些反动谬论。
      北京大学经济系的教师和北大民盟支部在这以前曾举行过七次小会，和陈振汉的反共言行作斗争。陈振汉态度很不老实，他说他的问题是思想问题不是政治问题。许多教师据理驳斥后，他又说：“我自己也没法解释为什么有这样多恶毒攻击党的言论。”
