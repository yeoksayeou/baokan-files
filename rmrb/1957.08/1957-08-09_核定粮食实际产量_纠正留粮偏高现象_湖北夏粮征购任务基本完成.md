Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 8th: Hubei Province has basically completed its summer grain procurement task, and the warehousing work is also basically finished. Xiangyang and Yichang prefectures have both overfulfilled their summer grain procurement tasks. Some areas that have not yet completed the task are stepping up procurement and warehousing efforts.

The reason Hubei Province completed its summer grain procurement task ahead of schedule this year is that it strengthened socialist ideological education in rural areas in a timely manner. In early June, shortly after the summer grain procurement work began, many areas, due to the fact that district and township cadres unilaterally demanded improvements in the people's lives, and agricultural cooperative cadres also accommodated the individualistic thinking of cooperative members who disregarded national interests, there was a phenomenon of agricultural cooperatives concealing yields and excessively high grain retention standards, resulting in slow progress in summer grain procurement and warehousing, with the state purchasing little and selling a lot. The amount of grain requested for supply in the third quarter throughout the province exceeded the province's controlled unified sales quota by more than 40 million jin. However, by June 20th, only 50 million jin of summer grain had been procured, less than half of the same period last year. Therefore, the Hubei Provincial People's Committee held a telephone conference in late June, instructing all localities to immediately strengthen socialist ideological education for cadres and peasants.

After the socialist ideological education was carried out in rural Hubei Province, the political consciousness of cadres and peasants was greatly enhanced. All localities actively verified grain yields, corrected false phenomena in supply, and adjusted unreasonable grain retention standards. The amount of summer grain procured throughout the province in July increased by about 80% compared to June. Many agricultural cooperatives actively delivered good grain and overfulfilled the summer grain procurement task. Moreover, in many areas, farmers also voluntarily returned grain coupons, requesting less or no grain supply from the state. Due to farmers consciously reducing grain supply, it is expected that the unified sales quota for the third quarter will not be exceeded.

    核定粮食实际产量　纠正留粮偏高现象
    湖北夏粮征购任务基本完成
    据新华社武汉8日电　湖北省夏粮征购任务已经基本完成，入库工作也基本结束。襄阳、宜昌两专区都超额完成了夏粮征购任务。一部分还没有完成任务的地区，正在加紧进行征购入库工作。
    今年湖北省提前完成夏粮征购任务，是及时在农村中加强了社会主义思想教育的结果。6月初，夏粮征购工作开始后不久，许多地区由于区、乡干部片面地要求改善群众生活，农业社干部也迁就社员不顾国家利益的个人主义思想，一度出现农业社隐瞒产量、留粮标准偏高等现象，形成夏粮征购、入库进度迟缓，国家购的少销的多。全省各地要求在第三季度供应的粮食，竟超过省内控制的统销指标四千多万斤。而征购的夏粮，到6月20日只有五千万斤，不及去年同期的一半。因此，湖北省人民委员会在6月下旬召开电话会议，指示各地立即对干部和农民加强社会主义思想教育。
    湖北省农村中开展社会主义思想教育后，干部和农民大大提高了政治觉悟。各地纷纷核实粮食产量，纠正供应中的虚假现象，调整了不合理的留粮标准。全省7月份征购的夏粮比6月份增加了80％左右。许多农业社积极缴售好粮，超额完成了夏粮征购任务。而且，不少地区的农民还自动把粮票退出来，少要求或不再要求国家供应粮食。由于农民自觉地压缩粮食供应量，预计第三季度的统销指标不会被突破了。
