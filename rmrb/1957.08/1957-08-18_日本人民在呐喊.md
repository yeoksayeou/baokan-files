    The Japanese People Are Crying Out
    Wu Xuewen
    On August 12th, at the official opening of the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament, representatives from various parts of Japan made accusations about the disasters caused by American atomic bombs and the crimes of the US military attempting to turn Okinawa into a permanent base. From these cries, I felt the Japanese people's emotions of demanding peace and national independence.
    Okinawa representative, Eiryo Nakamura, Central Executive Committee Member of the Okinawa Social Masses Party, solemnly stated on the stage: The Okinawa region had decided to send a delegation of thirty representatives led by Naha Mayor Kamejiro Senaga to participate in the Third World Conference, but due to the obstruction of the US military authorities in Okinawa, only nine of our representatives overcame the difficulties and rushed to the venue without even taking off their travel clothes. Nakamura's loud voice and firm expression aroused cheers in the hall. Nakamura continued, the 800,000 residents of Okinawa, under American rule, are the most hateful of war and demand peace. The people of Okinawa are resolutely resisting the American attempt to turn Okinawa into a permanent base, trample on human rights, and deprive them of their livelihoods. Democratic forces are growing daily. While demanding the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bombs, the people of Okinawa demand that the United States return Okinawa to Japan as soon as possible and demand Japan's complete independence. The participants were all encouraged by Nakamura's righteous appeal, and when he stepped down from the stage, many foreign representatives shook his hand warmly to express their respect.
    Mrs. Kuboyama, whose husband was taken away by the American hydrogen bomb, led her two daughters to the conference to accuse the Americans. She said: "It has been four years since the Daigo Fukuryu Maru incident, but nuclear weapons continue to threaten humanity more and more every day. The scene of my husband's death constantly appears before my eyes..."
    This woman had previously requested to go to the United Nations to file a complaint, but was unable to do so because the United States did not issue her a visa. However, today she stood before the people of the world to accuse the United States of its brutal and inhumane atomic strategy crimes. When she led her children sadly into the venue, millions of sympathetic eyes were fixed on them. People know clearly who took away their happy lives. If nuclear weapons cannot be completely prohibited, if Japan cannot get rid of the American war system, who knows how many people like them will appear before us.
    People listened to Mrs. Kuboyama's accusations with grief and indignation. The head of the Soviet delegation, Kairov, immediately went to Mrs. Kuboyama, kindly inquired about the lives of her and her daughters, and gave toys to Mrs. Kuboyama's two children. He said, I have two granddaughters of similar age to your children, and I hope they can correspond with each other. Shi Ruzhang, the Chinese representative, shook hands warmly with Mrs. Kuboyama, expressing the Chinese women's concern and sympathy for the Japanese women, and tears of pity moistened their eyes.
    Atomic bomb victims from Hiroshima and Nagasaki successively took the stage to speak, and seeing their scorched faces and limbs, people were filled with indignation.
    The Hiroshima representative said: This year alone, eighteen people in Hiroshima have died from atomic diseases, and more than a hundred atomic disease patients in the hospital are groaning in the abyss of despair.
    The Nagasaki representative said passionately at the meeting, we must endure the pain of our hearts and bodies and fight to the end until we see with our own eyes the realization of the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bombs.
    Sorrow, indignation, accusations, denunciations, all point to the war peddlers who want to implement a policy of strength with nuclear weapons. All this shows the firm will of the Japanese people to fight for justice.
    Yes! The struggle of the Japanese people is not isolated; it is supported by the people of the world. The atmosphere of today's meeting is a powerful proof.
    Zhao Puchu, the deputy head of the Chinese delegation, took the stage to express his condolences after the accusations of those victims. He said, who doesn't have parents, wives, and children, who doesn't have brothers and sisters? From Mrs. Kuboyama's accusations, I heard the voices of my own brothers and sisters. He said that the Chinese people fully support the just struggle of the Japanese people and express deep sympathy and condolences to the Japanese atomic bomb victims. Let me, on behalf of the 600 million Chinese people, shake hands with the representatives of Hiroshima, shake hands with the representatives of Nagasaki, and shake hands with Mrs. Kuboyama. He emphasized that the sacrifice of hundreds of thousands of lives should be a painful lesson. We should turn grief into strength and fight for peace. Victory must belong to us.
    Zhao Puchu's speech was interrupted by thunderous applause, and thousands of faces under the stage were excited. When Zhao Puchu embraced the representatives of Hiroshima and Nagasaki for a long time, when he held Mrs. Kuboyama's children and kissed them, the enthusiastic shouts in the hall echoed like waves, and many people shed tears for this moving scene. The heart-to-heart feelings of the Chinese and Japanese people made people feel the great power of peace and friendship.

    日本人民在呐喊
    吴学文
    8月12日，在禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会正式开幕的大会上，日本各地方代表纷纷对美国原子弹的灾害和美军企图变冲绳为永久基地的罪行进行控诉。我从这些呐喊中，体会到日本人民要求和平与民族独立的情感。
    冲绳代表、冲绳社会大众党中央执行委员中村荣在讲台上庄严地说：冲绳地方曾经决定派遣以那霸市长濑长龟次郎为首的三十名代表来参加第三届世界大会，但由于冲绳美军当局的阻挠，我们只有九名代表冲破了困难，还没有脱下旅途行装就赶到会场。中村的洪亮的声音、坚强的表情，激起了场中的欢呼。中村接着说，受到美国统治的八十万冲绳居民，是最憎恶战争、要求和平的。冲绳人民正在对美国变冲绳为永久基地、蹂躏人权和剥夺他们生活的进攻进行坚决的反抗，民主力量正在日益增长。冲绳人民在要求禁止原子弹氢弹的同时，要求美国早日把冲绳还给日本，要求日本的完全独立。与会者都为中村的正义呼吁所鼓舞，当他走下讲台时，许多外国代表向他亲切的握手致意。
    被美国氢弹夺去了丈夫的久保山夫人，这一天领着两个女孩子到大会上来控诉。 她说：“第五福龙丸罹难以来已经四载，但是核武器仍然日甚一日地威胁着人类，丈夫受害致死的景情不时地浮在我的眼前，……。”
    这位妇女不久前曾要求到联合国去控诉，但由于美国不发签证而未成行。可是，今天她站在全世界人民的面前控诉了美国的残无人道的原子战略罪行。当她领着孩子悲伤地走进会场时，千万只同情的眼睛向她们注视。人们清楚是谁夺去了她们的幸福生活，如果核武器不能被彻底禁止，如果日本不能摆脱美国的战争体制，还不知有多少像她们一样的人会出现在我们的面前。
    人们怀着悲愤的心情听完了久保山夫人的控诉。苏联代表团团长凯罗夫立即走到久保山夫人的面前，亲切地慰问她们母女的生活，并把玩具赠给久保山夫人的两个孩子。他说，我有两个孙女和你的孩子年龄相似，我希望她们能够互相通信。中国代表施如璋热烈地同久保山夫人握手，表示中国妇女对日本妇女的关怀与同情，悯爱的泪水润湿了她们的眼睛。
    广岛和长崎的原子受害者接连登台讲演，看到他们的被烧焦了的面孔与肢体，人们无不愤慨万分。
    广岛代表说：只是今年以来，广岛就有十八人死于原子病，病院里还有百余名的原子病患者呻吟在绝望的深渊中。
    长崎代表在会上激昂地说，我们要忍着心灵与肉体的苦痛奋斗到底，直到我们亲眼看到实现禁止原子弹和氢弹。
    沉痛、悲愤、控诉、痛斥，这一切都指向要用核武器实行实力政策的战争贩子，这一切表示了日本人民为正义而战的坚决意志。
    是的！日本人民的斗争不是孤立的，它受到全世界人民的支持，今天会场的气氛就是有力的证明。
    中国代表团副团长赵朴初在那些受害者的控诉后登台致词，表示慰问。他说，谁无父母妻子，谁无兄弟姊妹，从久保山夫人的控诉中，我听到了自己兄弟姊妹的声音。他说，中国人民对日本人民的正义斗争完全支持，并对日本原子弹受害者表示深切的同情与慰问。让我代表六亿中国人民和广岛代表握手，和长崎代表握手，和久保山夫人握手。他强调，几十万生命的牺牲，应当是惨痛的经验教训，我们应当化悲痛为力量，为和平而奋斗，胜利一定是属于我们的。
    赵朴初的讲话一句一句地被雷动般的掌声打断，台下的千百张面孔在激动着。当赵朴初和广岛、长崎代表长久地拥抱时、当他抱着久保山夫人的孩子亲吻时，场中的热烈呼声像海浪般地响着，多少人为这种动人的场面流下了热泪。中日人民心连着心的情感，使人们感到和平和友谊的伟大力量。
