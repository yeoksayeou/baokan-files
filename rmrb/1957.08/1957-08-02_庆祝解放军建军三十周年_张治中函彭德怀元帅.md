    Celebrating the 30th Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Liberation Army
    Zhang Zhizhong's Letter to Marshal Peng Dehuai
    Most Respected Marshal Peng Dehuai:
    This year's "August 1st" Army Day is a great and glorious commemoration of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's thirty years of heroic struggle. I would like to extend to you, and through you to all marshals, generals, colonels, lieutenants, and all soldiers, my most sincere and warmest congratulations.
    The Chinese People's Liberation Army's thirty years of heroic struggle, from growth to strength, have been extremely arduous, but successful. It went from the initial ten years of civil war and the 25,000-li Long March, to achieving the great victory of the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, and the complete victory of the three-year War of Liberation, liberating all the people of the country, establishing the People's Republic of China, and then achieving the decisive victory in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea - what a great historical achievement! What glorious thirty years of history!
    Why has the Chinese People's Liberation Army been able to create such great achievements and glorious historical records? In my humble opinion as a non-Party person, there are the following main factors:
    First, the Chinese People's Liberation Army is a people's armed force created, cultivated, and led by the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, fighting and sacrificing everything for the revolution and the interests of the people. Therefore, its position is clear and firm, and it will naturally generate vigorous fighting spirit and strong combat power.
    Second, the remarkable achievements of military and political work in the Chinese People's Liberation Army. It has not only gradually enriched command art and combat skills, but also enabled commanders and fighters to happily grasp political goals and enthusiastically accomplish political tasks. Therefore, it can grow from small to large, from weak to strong, and quickly develop into a victorious army that is invincible and overcomes all obstacles.
    Third, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has a particularly creative system, which is the democratic system in the army. It can enable the communication of wills between superiors and subordinates, and harmony of feelings between officers and soldiers. In particular, the spirit of care for subordinates and soldiers by superiors and officers has generated an incomparably strong force of unity between superiors and subordinates, and unity between officers and soldiers, who share weal and woe and live and die together.
    Fourth, the Chinese People's Liberation Army's spirit of supporting the government and cherishing the people, especially its spirit of serving the people, is truly commendable. For example, they cultivate and harvest for farmers, donate tractors, and bravely rescue people from disasters and dangers. Wherever they can serve the people, they are happy to do so, thus forming military-civilian unity. The people are so affectionate and joyous towards the People's Liberation Army, calling them the most beloved people, and children call "Uncle PLA" the most beloved person. Such a spirit of military-civilian unity—which is unprecedented in Chinese history—for the People's Liberation Army, the army receives such love and support from the broad masses of the people, and of course, it can exert unlimited potential and a backing role when necessary.
    The above is just my superficial analysis. The fine traditions and characteristics of the People's Liberation Army are numerous. I am not qualified to describe them completely, but I have always sincerely expressed my admiration and praise for the Chinese People's Liberation Army.
    Now the Chinese People's Liberation Army is protecting the smooth progress of the socialist construction of the motherland. It must safeguard the security of the motherland and safeguard peace in Asia and the world. We firmly believe that the People's Liberation Army has completed the regularization and modernization of education, organization, and equipment, and its combat power is ten or a hundred times stronger than in the past. It has full conditions and will definitely be able to accomplish such a sacred responsibility. Today, on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, I would like to once again express my most sincere and warmest wishes and congratulations!
    I am now resting in Beidaihe and cannot come to celebrate in person. Please accept my apologies.
    With respect,
    Zhang Zhizhong
                                    July 27

    庆祝解放军建军三十周年
    张治中函彭德怀元帅 
    最敬重的彭德怀元帅：
    今年“八一”节是中国人民解放军英勇奋斗三十年伟大而光荣的纪念日，我谨向您，并请转达我向诸位元帅、将军，诸位校官、尉官，全体士兵同志们致以最诚恳最热烈的祝贺。
    中国人民解放军三十年来英勇奋斗的经过，由成长而至壮大，是极艰苦的，但是成功的。它由最初十年内战、二万五千里长征之后，取得了八年抗日战争的伟大胜利，取得了三年解放战争的全部胜利，解放了全国人民，成立了中华人民共和国，继又取得了抗美援朝的决定性胜利——这是多么伟大的历史功勋！多么光荣的卅年史迹！
    中国人民解放军为什么能创造这样伟大的功勋和光荣的史迹呢？以我一个党外人士的粗浅看法，是有以下几个主要因素：
    首先是，中国人民解放军是中国共产党、毛主席所创造、所培养、所领导的人民武装力量，一切是为革命为人民利益而奋斗而牺牲的，所以立场明确而坚定，就自然会产生旺盛的战斗士气和坚强的战斗力量。
    其次是，中国人民解放军军中的军事工作与政治工作的显著成就。它不仅逐步丰富了指挥艺术和作战技巧，并且使指战员们愉快地掌握了政治目标，踊跃地达成了政治任务，所以能由小到大，由弱到强，很快就发展为战无不胜攻无不克的长胜军。
    第三，中国人民解放军有一种特别创造性的制度，就是军中民主制度。它能使上下级间、官兵间意志沟通，感情融洽，特别是上级对下级、官长对士兵的爱护精神，产生了同甘苦共生死的上下团结、官兵团结的坚强无比的力量。
    第四，中国人民解放军拥政爱民的精神，特别是为人民服务的精神，真是值得称赞。譬如他们为农民耕种收割，捐赠拖拉机，奋不顾身地救灾救人种种事实，凡是能为人民服务的地方，皆乐为之，所以形成了军民团结。人民对解放军是那样亲爱那样喜悦，称为最可爱的人，儿童们把“解放军叔叔”当作最亲爱的人的称呼。像这样军民团结的精神——这在中国历史上是没有的——对解放军来说，军队这样得到广大人民的爱护和支持，当然在必要时就能发挥无限的潜力作用和后盾作用。
    以上不过是我粗浅的分析，解放军的优良传统和特点是很多的，我是没有资格能说得完全的，但我对中国人民解放军一向就是衷心的表示敬佩和赞扬。
    现在中国人民解放军正保卫着祖国社会主义建设的顺利进行。必须保卫祖国的安全，保卫亚洲和世界的和平。我们坚决相信，解放军已经完成了正规化、现代化的教育、编制和装备，比过去战力强大了十百倍，是具有充分条件，一定能达成这样的神圣责任的。今当中国人民解放军建军三十周年纪念，特再一次表示最诚恳最热烈的愿望和祝贺！
    我现在北戴河休息，未能趋前庆贺，并致歉意。
    敬礼　张治中
                                    7月27日
