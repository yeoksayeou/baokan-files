Title: Flames That Cannot Be Extinguished

　　Since the heroic uprising of the Omani people broke out, it has been almost a month. The Omani people, with inferior equipment, have bravely resisted the barbaric British invading forces equipped with modern weapons, making the British colonialists extremely embarrassed and utterly exposed in their war of aggression against Oman. Now, the situation in Oman has changed, and the Omani insurgents have taken the initiative to withdraw from the capital, Nizwa, and retreated into the mountains to continue their resistance against the invaders.

　　This change in the Omani war situation does not mean the failure of the Omani people's uprising. On the contrary, the insurgents' strategic retreat, preserving their vital forces, is to actively resist the enemy in the long term. This is beneficial to the Omani insurgents and unfavorable to the British colonial army with modern equipment. The British colonialists' aggressive quagmire in the Middle East will become increasingly deep and they will be unable to extricate themselves.

　　Why do the British colonialists still dare to be so rampant in the Middle East after the Suez War, brazenly launch a full-scale offensive against the uprising people of Oman, and carry out armed provocations on the Yemeni border? This is because Britain's power throughout the Middle East has repeatedly suffered setbacks, and it must control the oil resources and strategic position of the Persian Gulf region, and therefore, it uses force to suppress the forces of nationalists in this region at all costs. At the same time, Britain is also trying to improve its position and resist the step-by-step encroachment of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" on British colonial interests.

　　As everyone knows, all of the United States' activities in the Middle East are aimed at striking both nationalist forces and British forces. This formula was announced to the world long ago by Dulles. In the recent period, the United States has actively squeezed out British forces in the Middle East and greatly expanded its territory. The United States has already placed the Baghdad Pact Group under the black flag of the "Eisenhower Doctrine," and at the same time, it is actively trying to drag Jordan and Lebanon, which have already fallen into the American net, into the Baghdad Pact Group. Currently, the spearhead of American expansion is aimed at Egypt and Syria, and it is trying to break through these two nationalist fortresses standing in the Middle East. To this end, it is doing its utmost to provoke the relationship between Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Egypt and Syria, divide the unity of Arab countries, and also instigate Israel to carry out armed provocations against Syria, and plot military offensives and subversive conspiracies against Syria. From the ambiguous attitude that the United States has adopted towards the Oman incident, it can be seen that it hopes that the current military conflict will create a situation that is favorable to the United States so that the evil hand of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" can be inserted into this region.

　　However, things will never be as beautiful as the imperialists imagine. The outbreak of the Omani uprising and the continuation of the war have already had a significant impact on the situation in the Middle East. Arab countries have further deepened their shared hatred of the British colonialists, and at the same time, through the United States' attitude towards the Oman incident, they have become more aware of what the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is all about, and they have begun to reunite on the Oman issue. The nine member states of the Arab League recently unanimously passed a resolution to submit the Oman issue to the United Nations Security Council for discussion. The Secretary-General of the Arab League has also informed the Bandung Conference countries, requesting Asian and African countries to support the Omani people's struggle against British aggression. And the world's peace forces, headed by the Soviet Union, resolutely sympathize with and support every action of the Arab national anti-colonialist struggle, giving the Arab people great courage and confidence in their struggle. The people of Arab countries have the reliable support of hundreds of millions of peace-loving people around the world in their just cause of striving for and safeguarding their national independence and resisting colonialism.

　　Therefore, it is fundamentally impossible for the US and British imperialists to extinguish the flames of Arab nationalism. It is by no means imperialism that determines the fate of the Arab world and the entire Middle East, but the great people of the Arab and Middle East who have already awakened. The US and British imperialists' brutal aggression against the Arab people of the Middle East will inevitably end in their complete failure.

    扑灭不了的火焰
    自从阿曼人民的英勇起义爆发以来，为时已近一月。阿曼人民以劣势的装备，英勇地抗击了拥有新式武器装备的、野蛮的英国侵略军，使得英国殖民者在侵略阿曼的战争中狼狈万状，窘态毕露。现在，阿曼战局已经发生了变化，阿曼起义者已经主动地撤离了首都尼兹瓦，退入山区，继续对侵略者进行抗战。
    阿曼战局的这一变化，丝毫不意味着阿曼人民起义的失败。相反，起义者在战略上的主动撤退，保存了自己的有生力量，以便主动地长期地抗击敌人。这对于阿曼起义者是有利的，而对于有着现代装备的英国殖民军是不利的。英国殖民者在中东的侵略泥足将越陷越深而不能自拔。
    英国殖民者在苏伊士战争以后，为什么仍然敢于在中东地区如此猖狂，悍然对阿曼起义人民发动全面进攻，并在也门边境进行武装挑衅呢？这是由于英国在整个中东的势力已一再受到挫折，对波斯湾地区的石油资源和战略地位必须加以控制，因而不顾一切地使用武力镇压这个地区的民族主义者的力量。同时，英国也力图改善自己的地位，抵抗“艾森豪威尔主义”对英国殖民利益的步步进逼。
    大家知道，美国在中东的一切活动，都是为了既打击民族主义势力，又打击英国的势力。这个公式是杜勒斯早就向全世界宣布了的。最近一个时期内，美国在中东积极地排挤了英国的势力，大大地扩张了自己的地盘。美国已经把巴格达条约集团置于“艾森豪威尔主义”的黑旗下，同时又积极地企图把已经落入美国网罗的约旦和黎巴嫩拖进巴格达条约集团。目前，美国扩张的矛头正针对埃及和叙利亚，力图攻破这两个屹立中东的民族主义堡垒。为此，它竭力地挑拨沙特阿拉伯、约旦与埃及和叙利亚的关系，分裂阿拉伯国家的团结，并且还指使以色列对叙利亚进行武装挑衅，策划对叙利亚的军事进攻和颠覆阴谋。从美国对阿曼事件所采取的暖昧态度可以看出，它希望目前的军事冲突会造成一种对美国有利的形势，以便“艾森豪威尔主义”的魔手插进这个地区。
    但是，事情绝不会是像帝国主义所设想的那样美妙的。阿曼起义的爆发和战争的延续，已经对中东局势发生了重大的影响。阿拉伯各国进一步加深了对英国殖民者的同仇敌忾，同时通过美国对阿曼事件的态度，更加看清了“艾森豪威尔主义”究竟是怎么一回事，它们已经在阿曼问题上开始重新团结起来。阿拉伯联盟的九个成员国最近一致通过决议，要把阿曼问题提交联合国安全理事会讨论。阿拉伯联盟秘书长并且已照会万隆会议国家，要求亚非国家支持阿曼人民反抗英国侵略的战斗。而以苏联为首的世界和平力量，坚决同情和支持着阿拉伯民族反殖民主义斗争的每一行动，给予了阿拉伯人民极大的斗争勇气和信心。阿拉伯各国人民在争取和维护自己民族独立、反抗殖民主义的正义事业中，有着全世界亿万和平人民的可靠支持。
    因此，美英帝国主义想要扑灭阿拉伯民族主义的火焰是根本办不到的。决定阿拉伯世界以至整个中东命运的，绝不是帝国主义，而是已经觉醒了的阿拉伯和中东的伟大的人民。美英帝国主义对中东阿拉伯人民的凶残侵略，是一定会以它们的彻底失败而告终。
