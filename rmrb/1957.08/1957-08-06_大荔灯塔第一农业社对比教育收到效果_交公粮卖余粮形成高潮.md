(Reported from Xi'an on the 5th of this newspaper) The Dali County Lighthouse First Agricultural Cooperative in Shaanxi Province recently used the "six contrasts" method to conduct socialist ideological education among its members. A climax of actively handing over public grain, selling surplus grain, and strengthening autumn field management has emerged in the cooperative.

This year, the Lighthouse First Agricultural Cooperative's wheat harvest was lower than last year's. Some cooperative members did not make a concrete analysis, and complained about collectivization, the Party, and the government. In particular, the reactionary remarks of rightists further confused the members' thinking. After studying this situation, the resident cadres and the cooperative's CCP branch, in July, divided the work among the branch committee members and used the form of general meetings and group discussions to educate all members using examples of recollection and comparison.

The six contrasts were: Which is better, the old or the new social system? Is the agricultural cooperative good, or is individual farming good? Is unified purchase and sales good or not? How much support does the state give to farmers? What are the changes in the social status of farmers in the new and old societies? Is the relationship between people worse or better?

After discussion, everyone recalled the situation in the old society. In the four villages where the cooperative is located, the miscellaneous taxes paid to the Kuomintang every year were equivalent to 230,000 yuan in RMB, equal to two-thirds of the annual income. Farmers were exploited and could never repay their debts to the landlords. Among the 370 households, more than 200 households were not able to eat their fill or have enough clothes to wear. Now, none of this exists. The land reform enabled more than 200 poor farmers to be distributed more than 4,000 mu of land and means of production. Then, from mutual aid teams to the establishment of agricultural cooperatives, the difficult life of more than 800 people relying on "bran and vegetables for half the year" has long been over. After comparison, everyone unanimously agreed that the new society is better after all.

Is the agricultural cooperative good, or is individual farming good? Everyone compared last year's situation, the first year of collectivization, with the time of individual farming. Last year, the wheat yield per mu was 252 jin, an increase of 117 jin compared to the past. The cotton yield per mu increased by 35 jin, and the average income per household was 651 yuan, an increase of three to five times compared to the past. This is because after collectivization, the collective strength was brought into play, technical reforms were implemented, and production was increased. Last year, the entire cooperative bought 3,500 zhang of cloth, and the total savings of the cooperative were 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. How could individual farming compare? In just over a year, more than 400 new houses were built.

Speaking of whether unified purchase and sales is good or not, everyone thought that in the past, there was an annual shortage of 150,000 jin of grain. In order to eat grain, they had to buy it at a high price and be exploited. After the implementation of unified purchase and sales, the grain shortage can be bought back at a reasonable price. Since last year, the cooperative has also become a surplus grain cooperative, selling more than 20,000 jin of surplus grain to the state.

When discussing the state's support for farmers, the members did the math. The value of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, cloth, and daily industrial products supplied by the state alone every year is more than 60,000 yuan. Without the support of the state and workers, it would be empty talk for farmers to develop production and improve their lives.

The changes in the social status of farmers in the new society are too great! As soon as the members started discussing, they remembered that there was one people's representative each from the township, county, and province in the cooperative. They participated in the discussion of national affairs, which was something they could not even dream of in the old society.

When the members talked about the relationship between people in the new society, everyone unanimously agreed that now everyone discusses things when there is something to do, and helps each other when there are difficulties. Young people are progressing quickly, the elderly are respected, and women are also participating in production. The phenomenon of being oppressed by landlords and not interacting with each other in the past no longer exists.

After the "six contrasts" discussion, everyone more clearly recognized the benefits of the Party and the People's Government leading farmers to take the road of collectivization, strengthened their determination to take the socialist road, and expressed that they would resolutely implement the state's policy of unified purchase and sales of grain. A climax of handing over public grain, selling surplus grain, and strengthening autumn cotton field management has emerged in the cooperative. Originally, according to predictions, the cooperative distributed 270 jin of grain per person after the summer harvest this year; the actual production was less than this amount, and only 240 jin were distributed per person. In order to complete the requisition task, the cooperative called on everyone to return the excess grain and sell it to the state according to the actual production amount. At first, some members had resistance, but after discussion, everyone immediately happily returned the excess grain, completing the task of requisitioning more than 300,000 jin of grain in a few days. The members are now striving for a bumper harvest of autumn crops. In the management of autumn cotton fields, not only have they weeded the cornfields, but some have also weeded the peanut fields, and have decided to prune the cotton buds and weed more thoroughly.

### 大荔灯塔第一农业社对比教育收到效果  交公粮卖余粮形成高潮

    大荔灯塔第一农业社对比教育收到效果
    交公粮卖余粮形成高潮
    本报西安5日电　陕西省大荔县灯塔第一农业社，最近用“六对比”的办法，向社员进行了社会主义思想教育。社里出现了积极交公粮、卖余粮和加强秋田管理的高潮。
    灯塔第一农业社今年小麦比去年减收，有的社员没有作具体分析，就埋怨合作化，埋怨党和政府。特别是右派分子的反动言论，更使社员们的思想混乱。驻社干部和社里的中共支部研究这种情况以后，在7月间由支委分工，采用大会报告、小组讨论的形式，用回忆对比的实例，向全体社员进行了教育。
    六对比的内容是：新旧社会制度那个好？农业社好还是单干好？统购统销好不好？国家支援农民多少？新旧社会农民社会地位有什么变化？人与人的关系是坏了还是好了？
    经过讨论，大家回忆起旧社会情形。这个社所在的四个村子，过去每年给国民党交的杂税就折合人民币二十三万元，等于全年收入的三分之二。农民受剥削，欠地主的债永远还不清。三百七十户中，就有二百多户食不饱肚，衣不蔽体。现在，这种情况都没有了。土地改革，使二百多户贫苦农民分到了四千多亩土地和生产资料。接着从互助组到成立农业社，原来八百多口人“糠菜半年粮”的困苦生活，也早就结束了。经过对比，大家一致认为到底还是新社会好。
    农业社好还是单干好？大家拿去年合作化第一年的情况和单干时作了对比。去年小麦亩产二百五十二斤，比过去提高一百一十七斤。棉花亩产增加了三十五斤，平均每户收入六百五十一元，比过去提高三倍到五倍。这都是因为合作化以后，发挥集体力量，贯彻技术改革，提高了生产的原故。去年全社买了三千五百丈布，全社积余的钱总有五、六万元。一年多的时间，还新盖了四百多间房子。单干时哪里能比呢？
    提起统购统销好不好？大家想到过去每年缺粮十五万斤，为了吃粮，要出大价去买，受人剥削。实行统购统销以后，缺粮能用合理价格买回来。从去年起社里还成了余粮社，卖给国家二万多斤余粮。
    讨论到国家支援农民的情况，社员们算了一笔账。每年仅国家供应的化学肥料、药剂、布匹和日用工业品等，价值就有六万多元。如果没有国家和工人的支援，农民发展生产、改善生活就会成为空话。
    新社会农民社会地位的变化太大啦！社员一讨论开，就想起社里有乡、县、省人民代表各一人。他们参加国家大事的讨论，这是在旧社会中做梦也想不到的事。
    在社员们谈到新社会人和人的关系时，大家一致认为现在是有事大家商量，有困难互相帮助。青年进步快，老年人受到尊重，妇女也参加了生产。过去那种受地主压迫，互不往来的现象再没有了。
    经过“六对比”的讨论，大家更认清党和人民政府领导农民走合作化的道路的好处，坚定了自己走社会主义道路的决心，并且表示要坚决贯彻国家的粮食统购统销政策。社里出现了交公粮、卖余粮的高潮和加强秋棉田管理的高潮。原来根据预测，今年夏收社里每人分了粮食二百七十斤；实产算下来比这个数目少，每人只够分二百四十斤。为了完成征购任务，社里号召按实产数目退出多余的粮食卖给国家。起先有的社员有抵触情绪，经过讨论后，大家立即心情愉快地退回了多余的粮食，几天中就完成征购粮三十多万斤的任务。社员们现在正争取秋季作物丰收，在秋棉田管理上，不但给玉米地锄了草，有的还给花生地锄了草，并且决定给棉花多扳一次芽子、多锄一次杂草。
