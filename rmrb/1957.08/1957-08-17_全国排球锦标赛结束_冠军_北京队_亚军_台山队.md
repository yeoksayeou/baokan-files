    全国排球锦标赛结束
    冠军——北京队  亚军——台山队
    新华社青岛16日电  在青岛举行的1957年全国排球锦标赛第二阶段的比赛，今天全部结束。比赛结果，男子组取得冠军的是北京队，亚军是台山队，第三名是上海队。女子组的冠军由上海队获得，江苏队是亚军，四川“红”队得第三名。
    第二阶段比赛是从8月4日开始的。当11日进入决赛阶段以后，男、女第一组各队为了争夺冠军，竞争十分激烈。男子组北京队在击败了晋江、辽宁、广州三队以后，又以三比零战胜了实力坚强的上海队。最后北京队由于防守疏忽，以二比三败给了善于猛攻的台山队。但北京队因为在决赛阶段积分比台山队多，而获得冠军。上海队在决赛中虽然曾以三比二战胜台山队，但由于台山队在决赛阶段净胜的局数多于上海队，台山队取得了亚军。
    在这次锦标赛中，男子组在第三名以后的名次是：广州队、晋江队和辽宁队。女子组在第三名以后的名次是：北京队、辽宁队和山东队。
