The commercial department system's campaign to increase production and practice economy has achieved remarkable results. The vast number of employees have established the idea of diligently managing enterprises, using their brains and finding clever ways to further improve management and supply work, and expanding capital accumulation.

The state-owned enterprises within the commercial department system have done everything possible to tap the potential sources of goods that are in short supply, thereby increasing the supply of certain commodities to the market. For example, the Shanghai First Commercial Bureau system unearthed 3,800 tons of metal materials and 2,600 tons of chemical raw materials in the first quarter of this year, solving the difficulty of insufficient raw materials for manufacturing many kinds of daily-use industrial products. The Tianjin Transportation Electrical Equipment Wholesale Station's employees went deep into factories, mines, enterprises, and waste product management units to purchase steel wire, steel balls, etc., solving the raw material problems for the parts of more than 17,000 bicycles and more than 3,000 coils of insulated wire. The Guangzhou Department Store Purchasing and Supply Station adopted methods such as "running diligently, asking diligently, and contacting diligently." In the first four months alone, it found raw materials such as 46 tons of scrap iron, tinplate, etc., and 4,860 kilograms of plastic. Using these raw materials, it increased the production of cloth-soled shoes, sanitary products, small locks, and other commodities worth more than 3 million yuan. The Qiqihar Petroleum Company recovered used waste oil from local factories, mines, and transportation departments, and processed 145 tons of machine oil in the first quarter. Some purchasing units, in their processing and ordering work, paid attention to working with production enterprises to study ways to save raw materials without affecting the quality of the goods. These methods have played a certain role in alleviating the situation of certain commodities being in short supply.

In the campaign to increase production and practice economy, careful calculation and various methods to save commodity circulation costs have become the daily actions of the vast number of employees. In terms of saving transportation costs, the method of centralized transportation has been widely used and promoted. To date, 21 provinces and cities have implemented centralized transportation in 40 locations, increasing the proportion of goods transported in full trainloads. For example, the Shanghai Transportation Station's full trainload shipments have reached 97% of its railway shipments. Many regions have also changed the transportation of goods from trains and trucks to waterways or combined water and land transportation, generally saving about a quarter of the cost. In addition, the technical loading capacity of goods has also been improved. All these measures have greatly reduced circulation costs.

Driven by the campaign to increase production and practice economy, the storage personnel in the commercial department system have also achieved good results in protecting commodity safety and reducing commodity losses. The Beijing Coal and Construction Company called on all employees to take action and sweep up coal dust. In the first quarter, the coal dust swept up from coal-transporting trains, trucks, tricycles, and cleaning sites and intersections reached 3,700 tons. In order to prevent inventory commodities from mildewing, being damaged, or deteriorating, many units have strengthened commodity storage work, studied methods to control warehouse temperature and humidity, and launched competitions. In the first quarter, the Beijing professional companies saved the state more than 10,000 yuan in reducing commodity losses. In addition, all regions have made relatively significant achievements in saving commodity packaging costs, saving a lot of wealth for the state.

Because employees in the commercial department system have further realized that carrying out social conservation work is an important part of the commercial system's efforts to increase production and practice economy, many units have actively carried out social conservation publicity and guidance work. For example, Beijing's promotion of the use of honeycomb coal stoves and the promotion of tailored fabric sales in many regions have been welcomed by consumers.

The commercial department system has also done some work in simplifying procedures and reducing administrative management personnel. Many units have conducted more systematic investigations and research work. Some units have implemented the method of joint office work by salespersons, accountants, and custodians, reducing the links in the entry and exit of goods. Using this method, the Tianjin Department Store reduced the number of links in the procurement of goods from the original 25 to 11; the time for goods arriving from other places to meet consumers has been shortened from the original 10 to 15 days to 4 days. Some regions have supplemented the business departments with excessive administrative management personnel, strengthening the business departments; some provinces have also sent some managers and section chiefs to grassroots units to participate in specific work for a certain period.

In the campaign to increase production and practice economy, the commercial department system has also encountered some problems. For example, a few units only made general appeals and lacked specific organizational leadership; some units did not combine the rectification campaign with the campaign to increase production and practice economy, which affected the development of the campaign; some units did not pay enough attention to ideological education and policy education, resulting in a one-sided pursuit of accelerating capital turnover, causing some commodities to experience undue shortages; individual units unrealistically lowered the retail loss rate of cotton cloth, so that the size was too tight when selling cloth, etc. These shortcomings need to be further resolved.

    挖掘货源多些再多些　流转费用少些再少些
　　商业部系统勤俭办企业
    本报讯　商业部系统开展增产节约运动已经取得了显著的成绩。广大职工树立了勤俭办企业的思想，动脑筋，找窍门，推动了经营管理和供应工作的进一步改进，并且扩大了资金的积累。
    商业部系统各国营企业千方百计地挖掘供应不足商品的货源潜力，增加了一部分供应市场的商品。上海市第一商业局系统，在今年第一季度内，就发掘了三千八百吨金属材料，二千六百吨化工原料，解决了许多种制造日用工业品的原材料不足的困难。天津市交通电工器材批发站的职工深入到厂矿、企业、废品经营处等单位收购钢丝、钢珠等，解决了一万七千多辆自行车的部件、三千多盘被复线的原材料。广州百货采购供应站采取“勤跑、勤问、勤联系”等办法，仅1至4月份找到的原料就有铁皮、马口铁等废料四十六吨、塑胶四千八百六十公斤，利用这些原料增加了布胶鞋、卫生用品、小锁等价值三百多万元的商品。齐齐哈尔市石油公司向当地厂矿、交通运输部门回收已经用过的废杂油，在一季度即加工出机器油一百四十五吨。有些采购单位在加工订货工作中，注意了与生产企业共同研究在不影响商品质量原则下节约原材料的办法，这些办法对缓和某些供应不足商品的情况，都起了一定的作用。
    在开展增产节约运动中，精打细算，想各种办法节省商品流转费用，已经成为广大职工的日常行动。在节约运输费用方面，集中运输的方法已经被广泛地运用和推广。到目前为止，有二十一个省市在四十个地点实行了集中运输，增加了商品运输的整车发运比例，如上海运输站整车发运已达到铁路发运量的97％。许多地区还把原来由火车、汽车运输的货物改用水运或水、陆联运，一般约节省费用四分之一。此外，商品的技术装载量也有了提高。所有这些措施都大大降低了流转费用。
    在增产节约运动的推动下，商业部系统保管人员在保护商品安全，降低商品损耗方面也取得了较好的成绩。北京市煤建公司号召职工人人动手，扫净煤末，第一季度从运煤的火车、大车、三轮车和清扫场地、道口等扫起的煤末即达三千七百吨。为了防止库存商品霉烂、残损、变质，许多单位加强了商品保管工作，研究了控制仓库温度、湿度的办法，并且开展了竞赛。北京市各专业公司第一季度在降低商品损耗方面为国家节约了一万余元。此外在节约商品包装费用方面各地也都做出了比较显著的成绩，为国家节省了大量财富。
    由于商业部系统的职工已经进一步认识到开展社会节约工作是商业系统增产节约的一个重要部分，不少单位积极地进行了社会节约的宣传与指导工作。如北京推广使用蜂窝煤炉，许多地区推行的量体售布等方面，受到广大消费者的欢迎。
    商业部系统在简化手续制度，减少行政管理人员方面也进行了一些工作。许多单位进行了比较系统的调查研究工作。有的单位实行业务员、会计员、保管员三员联合办公的办法，减少了进、出货环节。天津市百货公司用这种办法，进货从原有二十五道环节减为十一道；外埠到货原来需要十到十五天才能与消费者见面，现在已经缩短为四天。有的地区把过多的行政管理人员充实到业务部门，增强了业务部门的力量；有的省并且派了一些经理、科长一级的干部到基层单位，在一定时期内参加具体工作。
    商业部系统在开展增产节约运动中也曾出现一些问题，例如，有少数单位只作了一般号召，缺乏具体的组织领导；有的单位没有把整风运动与增产节约运动结合起来，这都影响了运动的开展；有的单位对思想教育、政策教育重视不够，产生了片面追求加速资金周转，致使某些商品发生不应有的脱销现象；个别单位不切实际地降低棉布零售损耗率，以致在售布时把尺寸卡得过紧等，这些缺点都有待进一步解决。
