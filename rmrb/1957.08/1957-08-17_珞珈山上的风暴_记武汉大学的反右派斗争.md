    The Storm on Luojia Mountain – A Record of the Anti-Rightist Struggle at Wuhan University
    By Our Reporters Gu Weijin and Zhang Wei

    Not long ago, rightist elements at Wuhan University on Luojia Mountain took advantage of the Party's rectification campaign to launch an anti-Party, anti-socialist storm, turning the picturesque Luojia Mountain into a miasma of foul air.

    The Voices Emanating from Room 209

    There were thirty-three students in Class 871 of the Chinese Department at Wuhan University, of which twenty-five were from exploiting families of landlords and capitalists. Many of their relatives had been struggled against, imprisoned, placed under control, or suppressed during the socialist revolution. Because their own class stand had not been transformed, many of them were also subjected to struggle, punishment, or purging (some were purged from their jobs) during the Three-Anti and Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries movements. They were very dissatisfied with the Party and the new society. In particular, Wu Kaibin, Yao Zhongqi, Li Zhengyu, Lu Sifei, and others living in Room 209 harbored resentment against the Party and the new society. They clamored that there was no democracy and no freedom of speech today. Wu Kaibin said: Socialism is so dull! They opposed all political activities and attacked political classes. They advocated "independent thinking," saying that one should not be superstitious about "dogma." They often said: If what grows between your shoulders is not a winter melon but a head, you will think about some issues more and more deeply. They promoted the Zhang-Luo Alliance, saying that the rightist elements were the most righteous and had the most conscience. After seeing Lin Xiling's "A Complaint of a Young Citizen," they called on people with conscience to speak out for this "smart, strong, outstanding person who dared to boldly prick some vile and stinking people with her sharp edges."

    In order to spread these anti-Party, anti-socialist fallacies to their classmates in a planned and methodical manner, they implemented "gradual indoctrination, acting according to circumstances." On the one hand, they took advantage of the students' urgent desire to improve their professional skills to spread non-political tendencies; on the other hand, they systematically and extensively peddled their various fallacies under the guise of free thought. As a result, before the students could understand major international and domestic issues, they were imperceptibly poisoned by them. By the time Wuhan University was about to start the rectification campaign, the number of people who agreed with their anti-Party and anti-socialist fallacies had expanded from a few to twenty-nine.

    Dark Clouds Envelop Luojia Mountain

    In early May, Wuhan University began its rectification campaign. Rightist elements such as Wu Kaibin, Yao Zhongqi, Fang Yuqing, and Jiang Zhaohu of Class 871 in the Chinese Department saw that the Party's call for rectification was a golden opportunity to attack the Party. They launched a campaign to encourage the third-year students to take the lead in speaking out and organized a headquarters for attacking the Party – the Flame Newspaper. In the first issue of the Flame Newspaper, they published a "Letter to Students" to encourage speaking out. They also sent people to meetings and lectures in various departments to incite them to create newspapers and lead the speaking out. They also ignited the flames among the staff. Seeing the rightist elements setting fires everywhere, the Party committee took the initiative to call on the entire school to speak out. In order to let all the demons and monsters come out, they consciously adopted a laissez-faire attitude and repeatedly called on Party members and Youth League members to be calm, patient, and not to easily fight back. For a time, the rightist elements were arrogant and even more frantically attacked the Party. They controlled the "Student Newspaper Liaison Station" and opposed the speaking out organization led by the Party committee. They actively colluded with rightist elements from various departments to mobilize those who had been struggled against, imprisoned, placed under control, or suppressed in the past to "pour out their grievances," publishing the "suffering" of the "victims" in the Flame Newspaper with large headlines. They attacked the Personnel Department as a "dark little kingdom"; proposed replacing the director and deputy director of the Personnel Department, reorganizing the Personnel Department, and making archives public. They organized many symposiums, mobilized the masses to discuss whether "the relationship between people after liberation is cold and ruthless," whether "the Hu Feng clique is counter-revolutionary," and whether "the achievements of the anti-counter-revolutionary campaign at Wuhan University are the main thing." They held democratic forums, vigorously promoting various anti-Party and anti-socialist fallacies. Han Yuxian (a Youth League member) of Class 871 of the Chinese Department openly attacked Party members and Youth League members at the democratic forum. She said: What is a Communist Youth League member worth? Five cents would be enough to sell one. She said she would mobilize her lover to withdraw from the Party. They guided the masses to discuss that the root cause of the "three evils" was the school's poor system, demanding the abolition of the Party committee responsibility system and the establishment of a teacher-run democratic school management system; at the same time, they led the movement to factories and villages, mobilizing the masses to fight for "democracy," "human rights," and "freedom."

    Supporters Behind the Scenes

    The fact that Wu Kaibin and other small handful of rightist elements in Class 871 of the Chinese Department dared to throw the first bomb of attack on the Party in the entire school and lead the rightist elements of various departments to attack the Party was inseparable from the support of external forces. Cheng Qianfan, a disciple of Ma Zemin and the head of the rightist professors at Wuhan University, was the main supporter and guide of this small handful of rightist elements. At the beginning of the speaking out, Cheng Qianfan actively encouraged them.

    Cheng Qianfan told them not to always invite those few people who were always speaking out, but to find some people who did not speak out much. He said that these people were also "very insightful." He also told them to find some people who had just returned from abroad, as they knew the situation in the West and would have good opinions. Qian Tonggang, a reporter from Guangming Daily sent by Chu Anping to ignite the flames, also gave great support to these rightist elements. He praised them for speaking out accurately: "The schools in the Wuhan area are only engaged in minor issues such as anti-relocation of schools and changing school names, but you are doing well." At their symposium, he firmly expressed his support for them, hoping that they would continue to do so. The rightist elements were all jubilant. Lin Xiling, who had close ties with Tan Tiwu, also gave great support to these rightist elements. She sent Wu Kaibin her "Complaint" and the "Plaza" magazine of the rightist elements at Peking University, which strengthened the rightist elements' determination to ignite the flames. Lin Xiling also instructed Wu Kaibin in a letter, "Don't reform little by little, reform thoroughly!" Wu Kaibin called Lin Xiling his confidante and heroine.

    Brave People

    During the process of Wu Kaibin and other rightist elements of Class 871 of the Chinese Department at Wuhan University attacking the Party triumphantly, four of the thirty-three students in Class 871 had been resolutely opposing Wu Kaibin and other rightist elements and carrying out a tenacious struggle against them. These four people were: Tian Di (Youth League Branch Secretary), Shi Daha (Youth League Secretary), Tang Guofu (Party member), and Yang Jingchun (masses). Even before this rectification campaign, in every political study movement, Tian Di and other four people had fundamental differences with Wu Kaibin and other rightist elements on their views of the Party and the new society, such as opposing Wu Kaibin and others only talking about the shortcomings of work and not talking about the achievements of work, and completely denying the achievements of the anti-counter-revolutionary campaign. Wu Kaibin and others colluded everywhere and held secret meetings during the rectification campaign. Tian Di and others launched a struggle against the rightist elements in the class. They cited many facts to affirm the achievements of personnel work and refuted the fallacy of the rightist elements that "the Personnel Department is a dark little kingdom." The rightist elements hated them very much. At every meeting of the class newspaper (i.e., the Flame Newspaper) to discuss speaking out, the rightist elements used an overwhelming majority (twenty-nine people) to reject the four people's protests against the propaganda that fabricated rumors and slandered the Party. They had almost no right to speak in the class. Their situation was very difficult. But they were calm, firm, and uncompromising. In addition to three people who continued to persist in the struggle in the class, Tian Di (female) went to the second grade to collude with female students to create the "March 8th Society" to fight the rightist elements. In their own newspaper, they proposed that helping the Party rectify should be done with gentle breezes and fine rain, starting from the desire for unity, and opposed engaging in "big democracy." After the China Youth Daily published "Harmful Horse Lin Xiling," Tian Di immediately published an article in her own newspaper "Eliminating Lin Xiling's Influence in the Chinese Department of Wuhan University," and at the same time exposed the relationship between Wu Kaibin and Lin Xiling. Seeing that the situation was not right, the rightist elements pretended to be progressive, holding the banner of anti-rightist elements, and publishing the "Big Hammer" newspaper, but the "March 8th Society" immediately exposed their conspiracy of wearing the cloak of leftists and doing the deeds of rightists. The "Big Hammer" published an issue and then ceased publication. The rightist elements were very annoyed and cursed the "March 8th Society." But the "March 8th Society" was not defeated by the rightist elements' scolding. So the rightist elements sent Yang Yiqiang and Gao Dingding, teaching assistants in the Chinese Department, to the "March 8th Society" to shake Tian Di and debate with Tian Di. However, all of this was thoroughly refuted by Tian Di.

    Tian Di, Shi Daha, and others fought unyieldingly against the rightist elements, upholding justice and uniting the masses; many left-wing newspapers such as "Hedgehog," "Gentle Breeze," "Unity," and "Truth" appeared in various departments and united around the "March 8th Society," and these left-wing forces became the main force in counterattacking the rightist elements later.

    Bugle Call Resounds Through Luojia Mountain

    The struggle of teachers and students of Wuhan University against the rightist elements began. The entire school held a conference to denounce the rightist elements. The combat mobilization report of Party Secretary Liu Zhen aroused the masses to attack the rightist elements with drums and attacks. Even the middle elements were exposed by the masses for their shameful anti-Party and anti-socialist behavior and woke up, stood firm, and joined the ranks of the struggle. The spearhead of the comprehensive and organized anti-rightist struggle immediately pointed to the headquarters of the rightist elements – the Flame Newspaper of the third grade of the Chinese Department.

    Under the power of the strong counterattack, the members of this rightist headquarters attempted to muddle through with empty self-criticisms and offensive and defensive alliances, but they failed. In order to thoroughly disarm the rightist elements ideologically, people launched a full-scale rational struggle with them – allowing the rightist leader Wu Kaibin to fully explain his set of anti-Party and anti-socialist fallacies twice in the school's eight major debate meetings. Then, teachers and students from various departments criticized these fallacies one by one. Thus, the face of this gentle, always posing as an "anguished seeker of truth" anti-Party and anti-socialist Wu Kaibin was nakedly exposed. Under the education of the debate meetings, the masses improved their understanding and further drew a clear line between themselves and the rightist elements. This rightist headquarters was completely isolated. With the development of the work of winning over education, those who had been deceived and joined this rightist group all woke up and launched a face-to-face struggle with Wu Kaibin. Wu Kaibin was speechless and had to write a self-criticism "Repenting and Apologizing to the People."

    The storm stirred up by the rightist elements on Luojia Mountain has been quelled! This storm has tempered thousands of students.

    珞珈山上的风暴——记武汉大学的反右派斗争
    本报记者  古维进  张碨
    不久以前，珞珈山上武汉大学的右派分子利用党整风的机会，掀起一场反党、反社会主义的风暴，把风景如画的珞珈山搞得乌烟瘴气。
    从209号房发出的声音
    武汉大学的中文系三年级871班有三十三个学生，其中有二十五人是出身于地主和资产阶级的剥削家庭，他们的亲属有许多是在社会主义革命运动过程中被斗、被关、被管制或者被镇压过的，他们本人的阶级立场由于未得到转变，在三反、肃反等运动中，有许多人也受到斗争、处分、清洗（有些人是从工作岗位清洗出来的）等。他们对于党和新社会很不满意，特别是住在209号房的吴开斌、姚中琦、李正宇、卢斯飞等，对党和新社会更是怀恨在心。他们叫嚷着今天没有民主，今天没有言论自由。吴开斌说：社会主义真沉闷啊！他们反对一切政治活动，攻击政治课。他们提倡“独立思考”，说不应该迷信“教条”。他们经常说：如果你们两肩中间长的不是冬瓜而是脑袋，你们就会更多更深刻地思考一些问题。他们宣传章罗联盟右派分子是最有正义和良心的。他们看到林希翎的“一个青年公民的控诉书”后，号召有良心的人要为这位“聪明、坚强、出色的、敢将自己的棱角大胆地刺痛了一些卑污发臭的人”鸣不平。
    他们为了把这些反党、反社会主义的谬论有计划有步骤地散布到同学中去，实行“逐渐灌输，见机行事”，他们一面利用同学们对提高业务的迫切愿望，散布非政治倾向；一面以自由思想为名，系统地大量地贩买了他们的各种谬论。使得同学们当时对重大的国际国内问题还没有弄清楚之前，无形中受了他们的毒害。到武大将要开始整风为止，赞同他们的反党、反社会主义谬论的已由几个人扩大到二十九人。
    乌云笼罩珞珈山
    5月初，武大开始整风。中文系三年级871班吴开斌、姚中琦、方雨晴、蒋兆鹄等右派分子看出了党号召整风，是向党进攻的千载难逢的机会，他们发动三年级同学带头鸣放，并组织了向党进攻的司令部——火焰报社，在火焰报第一期上，发表了鼓动鸣放的“告同学书”，他们还派人到各系开会、讲演、串连，鼓动各系创办报刊领导鸣放，并在职工中点火。党委看见右派分子四处点火，便主动地号召全校鸣放，为了让所有牛鬼蛇神都放出来，有意识地采取放任态度，并一再号召党团员沉着、忍耐，不得轻易还手。右派分子一时气焰万丈，更加猖狂地向党进攻。他们控制了“学生报刊联络站”和党委领导的鸣放组织对抗。他们积极串联各系的右派分子去发动过去被斗、被关、被管制或者被镇压的不法分子起来“诉苦”，把“苦主”的“苦”在火焰报以大字标题刊登。他们攻击人事处是“黑暗的小王国”；提出撤换人事处正副处长，改组人事处，公开档案等。他们组织许多座谈会，发动群众讨论“解放以后人与人的关系是冷酷无情的”、“胡风集团是反革命吗？”“武大肃反成绩是主要的吗？”他们举办民主讲坛，大肆宣传反党、反社会主义的各种谬论，中文系三年级韩豫贤（团员）还露骨地在民主讲坛攻击党团员。她说：共青团员算什么，五分钱就把它卖掉。她表示要动员她的爱人退党，他们引导群众讨论造成“三害”的根源是由于学校制度不好，要求取消党委负责制建立教师民主管理学校制；同时把运动引向工厂农村，发动群众起来争“民主”、争“人权”、争“自由”。
    幕后的支持者
    中文系三年级吴开斌等一小撮右派分子敢于在全校投下向党进攻的第一颗炸弹和带动各系的右派分子向党进攻，是和外力的支持不可分离的。马哲民的爪牙、武大右派教授头子程千帆是这一小撮右派分子的主要支持者和指导者。在鸣放开始时，程千帆积极给他们打气。
    程千帆要他们不要老邀那几个常鸣常放的人，而要找一些不大鸣放的人，他说这些人也是“很有见解的”。还要找一些刚从外国回来的人，他们知道西方情况，也会有很好的意见。储安平派光明日报记者钱统钢来点火，也给了这些右派分子很大的支持。他称赞他们鸣得准确：“武汉地区几个学校只是搞反迁校、改校名等小问题，你们搞得还好”。他在他们的座谈会上，坚决表示支持他们，希望他们继续搞下去。右派分子都欢欣鼓舞。与谭惕吾有密切关系的林希翎对这些右派分子的支持也是很大的。她寄给吴开斌的“控诉书”和北大右派分子的“广场”杂志，加强了右派分子点火的决心。林希翎还在信上指示吴开斌“不要一点一滴地改良，要彻底改革啦”。吴开斌把林希翎称为天涯知己、巾帼英雄。
    勇敢的人
    在武大中文系三年级吴开斌等右派分子洋洋得意向党进攻过程中，三年级871班的三十三个学生中有四个人一直在坚决地反对吴开斌等右派分子，并向他们进行了顽强的斗争。这四个人就是：田蒂
  （团支委）史大浩（团支书）唐国富（党员）杨景春（群众）。还在这次整风以前，在每次政治学习运动中，田蒂等四人和吴开斌等右派分子对党、对新社会的看法，就发生了根本的分歧，例如他们反对吴开斌等只谈工作缺点不谈工作成绩和完全否定肃反的成绩等。吴开斌等在整风中四处串联、秘密开会，田蒂等人在班上和右派分子展开了斗争。他们举出许多事实肯定了人事工作的成绩，回击了右派分子所谓“人事处是黑暗小王国”的谬论。右派分子对他们非常痛恨，在每次班报（即火焰报）会议研究鸣放的时候，右派分子以压倒多数（二十九人）否决了这四个人抗议对党造谣污蔑的宣传。他们在班上几乎没有发言权了。他们的处境十分困难。但是他们沉着坚定，毫不妥协。他们除三个人仍在班上坚持斗争外，由田蒂（女）到二年级串联女同学创办“三八社”和右派分子斗争。他们在自己的报纸上提出帮助党整风要和风细雨，从团结的愿望出发，反对搞“大民主”。中国青年报刊登“害群之马林希翎”之后，田蒂立即在自己的报上发表
  “肃清林希翎在武大中文系的影响”的文章，同时揭穿吴开斌和林希翎的关系。右派分子看风头不对，又伪装进步，打着反右派的旗子，出版“大铁锤”报，但是，“三八社”立即揭穿了他们披着左派的外衣干右派的勾当的阴谋。“大铁锤”出版了一期停刊了。右派分子非常恼火，辱骂“三八社”。但是“三八社”没有被右派分子骂倒。于是右派分子派出中文系助教杨翊强、高定鼎到“三八社”去动摇田蒂，和田蒂辩论。但是，这一切都给田蒂批驳得干干净净。
    田蒂、史大浩等人，不屈不挠地和右派分子作斗争，伸张了正气，团结了群众；各系出现“刺蝟”“和风”“团结”“真理”等许多左派的报都团结在“三八社”的周围，而这些左派力量就成为后来反击右派分子的主要力量。
    号角响彻珞珈山
    武大师生反右派分子斗争开始了。全校举行了声讨右派分子大会，党委书记刘真的战斗动员报告，激起群众对右派分子鸣鼓而攻，即使中间分子也被群众大量揭发右派分子反党、反社会主义的可耻行为而清醒了头脑，站稳立场，参加斗争行列。全面的有组织的反右派斗争的矛头立即指向右派分子的司令部——中文系三年级的火焰报社。
    在强大的反击的威力下，这个右派司令部的成员企图以空洞的检讨和攻守同盟蒙混过关，但是他们失败了。为了从思想上彻底解除右派分子的武装，人们和他们展开充分的说理斗争——让右派头子吴开斌在全校的八次大辩论会中有两次去充分讲出他的一套反党、反社会主义的谬论。然后各系的教师和同学把这些谬论一个一个的加以批驳，于是这位文质彬彬的、一向把自己扮成“真理的苦闷探求者”的反党、反社会主义的吴开斌的面目赤裸裸地暴露出来了。群众在辩论会的教育下，提高了认识，进一步和右派分子划清界限。这个右派司令部完全陷于孤立状态了。随着争取教育工作的开展，过去受蒙蔽参加这个右派集团的人都觉醒过来，和吴开斌展开面对面的斗争，吴开斌词穷理屈，不得不写出“向人民悔过和请罪”的检讨书。
    右派分子在珞珈山上掀起的一场风暴被平息了！这一场风暴锻炼了千万个同学。
