　  Watermelons on Trellises: Output Doubles

    The "trellis watermelon" experiment has been successfully conducted by the Zongta Agricultural Cooperative in the Shijiazhuang suburbs of Hebei Province.

      The "trellis watermelon" was successfully tested by Feng Miaohe, a cooperative member with more than 20 years of watermelon growing experience. Last year, a watermelon vine he planted grew on an earthen slope and produced watermelons weighing more than ten catties. From this, he speculated that watermelons could be grown on trellises. Later, he saw trellised winter melons in the vegetable garden, which further aroused his interest in experimenting with trellised watermelons. This year, he proposed a trial cultivation of trellised watermelons, which was supported by the cooperative leadership.

    He planted trellised watermelons on eight fen of land, planting a total of more than 600 plants, one to one and a half times more than usual. Because of the ventilation and light exposure, the trellised watermelons developed and grew very evenly. Also, because the melons were not easily spoiled by ground moisture, they tasted delicious, sandy, and sweet, with very little loss. According to the harvest from these eight fen of land, it is estimated that one mu of land can yield 10,000 catties of watermelons, doubling the yield of ordinary watermelons. The melons were also large, the largest weighing fourteen or fifteen catties, and the smallest seven or eight catties. (Ying Ying) (Attached picture)

　  西瓜上架　增产一倍
    河北省石家庄郊区冢塔农业社的“架西瓜”已试验成功。
      “架西瓜”是有二十多年种西瓜经验的社员冯庙合试验成功的。去年，他种的西瓜有一棵瓜蔓生长在土坡上，结了十多斤重的西瓜。他由此推想西瓜可不可以在架上长的事。后来他到菜园里看到了架冬瓜，更引起试验架西瓜的兴趣。今年他提出试种架西瓜的建议，得到社领导的支持。
    他在八分地上试种架西瓜，一共种了六百多棵，比平常种的棵数多一倍至一倍半。架西瓜因通风、透光，发育生长的很均匀，又因瓜不易被地气熏坏，味美沙甜，损失极少。据这八分地的收获量折算，一亩地能收西瓜一万斤，比平常的西瓜多收一倍。瓜个也大，最大的十四、五斤重，小的七、八斤。（英英）（附图片）
