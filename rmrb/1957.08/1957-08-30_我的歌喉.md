    Right-wingers say that today's news, publishing, and literature are "Goethe-ists." This doesn't mean we are followers of the famous German poet "Goethe," but they hate us because we sing the praises of the Party and socialist construction. For the victory of today and tomorrow, I will cheer and sing the praises of the merits of our beloved Communist Party thousands and thousands of times, because it is the Party that leads us to victory. I will also proclaim the merits of the people thousands and thousands of times, for it is they who follow the Party and create this beautiful era. Without the people, I would lose the soil for my survival; without the Party, I would lose our beautiful future. Let the right-wingers scold and curse loudly. For the Party and the people, I am willing to be a "Goethe-ist" for the rest of my life! You can cut off my head, but you can never change my nature! For my poor parents, I fought for more than ten years (at that time, you may have cursed me as a "daredevil!") The first drop of blood my mother gave me was filled with hatred for you, and the first drop of blood my mother gave me was filled with love for the Party! If needed, my song will turn into a rocket, then you can still curse me as a "charging type"! My class tells me that you are my irreconcilable enemies. If you don't surrender, my rocket will send you to the coffin!

    右派分子说我们今天的新闻出版和文学是“歌德派”。这并不是说我们是德国名诗人“歌德”的追随者，而是因我们歌颂了党，歌颂了社会主义建设而仇视。为了今天和明天的胜利，我要千遍万次地高声喝彩，歌颂我们亲爱的共产党的功德，是他领导着我们把胜利得来。我也要千遍万次地宣扬人民的功绩，是他们跟着党创造了这美好的时代，没有人民我就会失去生存的土壤，没有党我就会失去我们美好的未来。右派分子要骂就大声的骂吧，为党为人民我愿作一辈子的“歌德派”！我的头颅你们可以砍掉，我的本性你们决无法改！为了穷苦的父母我曾打过十多年的仗，（那时候也许你们还骂过我是“拼命派”！）娘给我的第一滴血里就充满了对你们的恨，娘给我的第一滴血里就充满了对党的爱！如果需要，我的歌就会变成火箭，那时，你们还可以骂我是“冲锋派”！我的阶级告诉我，你们是我不共戴天的敌人，如不投降，我的火箭就把你们送进棺材！
