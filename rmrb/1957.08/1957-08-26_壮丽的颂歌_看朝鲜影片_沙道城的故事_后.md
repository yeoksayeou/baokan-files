　　A Magnificent Ode
　　——After Watching the Korean Film "The Story of Sandao Castle"
　　Cao Xin
　　Seventeen hundred years ago, in a spring when hundreds of flowers were blooming, in Sandao Castle on the azure east coast of Korea, the people were celebrating the 61st birthday of the castle lord. The arrogant A-han cheated in a martial arts competition to win the favor of the castle lord's beloved daughter, Qin Ji, but Qin Ji was in love with the honest and sincere Shun Zhi. When Shun Zhi and Qin Ji met in the pavilion garden, they were discovered by the stepmother and A-han. Shun Zhi was dismissed and returned to his hometown, where he worked hard with the fishermen. Every day at sunset, he would play the flute, thinking of Qin Ji. Suddenly, invaders attacked Sandao Port. General Yu led A-han and others to supervise the battle and kill the enemy. As a result, A-han was surrounded and the front line was in urgent need. The castle lord was also bedridden. Qin Ji decided to go to war in place of her father. The people of Sandao Port, led by Shun Zhi, rose up to kill the enemy. The two sides converged in one place. Shun Zhi did not hold old grudges and rescued A-han from the encirclement, averting the crisis. Qin Ji and Shun Zhi formed a happy marriage in the battle.
　　This is the content of the film "The Story of Sandao Castle". This is a documentary of a dance drama starring the famous Korean dancer Choi Seung-hee. The artists enthusiastically praised the heroic characters who were always with the people, loyal to their country, and loyal to love. Although the dance drama did not have any language as a medium, we deeply understood the characters' character thoughts and emotions from the history of their actions. Shun Zhi, who was modest and simple to the people, did not hold old grudges, was brave and good at fighting the enemy, and was loyal to love, gave us a very deep impression. From Qin Ji, we saw the beautiful and kind soul of Korean women. They were proud to be able to protect their country with men, and they despised those villains who were arrogant and rude for personal gain. The story of Sandao Castle is an ode to national heroes, a poem narrating steadfast love.
　　"The Story of Sandao Castle" has also achieved gratifying achievements in sorting out and developing national dance. It seamlessly integrates narrative dance and performance dance, and harmoniously unifies delicate, beautiful, and national characteristic dances with simple and moving music into a whole. The play brings together many of Korea's best dances, such as the classical
   "Sword Dance", and the solo dance "Rainbow" created by Comrade Choi Seung-hee in recent years. However, in the development of the plot, we cannot even find any disconnection. It blends into one to serve the development of the whole play and to express the inner emotions of the characters. The performance dance also portrayed the characters' personalities. In the scene of the martial arts competition, A-han arbitrarily waved his sword and danced with a frivolous and contemptuous expression, defeating his opponent. The few movements deeply reflected A-han's arrogant and flashy personality. When he stole and defeated Shun Zhi, shamelessly taking victory as his own to receive the reward, even without the explanation of subtitles, we could clearly recognize this character through these character dances.
　　Comrade Choi Seung-hee, who played the affectionate and brave heroine Qin Ji, skillfully used the beauty of physical movements to express the characters' thoughts and feelings in every dance movement. Because her dance movements were created on the basis of solid inner emotions, her every move seemed so natural, harmonious, and beautiful, containing such rich dance language and such deep emotions.
　　The directors, art, and photography workers arranged a real and beautiful environment for the whole play. The birthday hall, the lakeside pavilion, the fishing coast, the city tower for swearing an oath, the battlefield for fierce battles... These scenes not only do not limit the progress of the dance, but also strongly set off the typical environment of the whole play, creating an atmosphere consistent with the plot. Especially those scenes with oriental colors make us feel kind.
　　I believe that the dance drama "The Story of Sandao Castle" will give Chinese dance workers valuable inspiration, and their rich creative experience will also have a lot to learn from.

　　壮丽的颂歌
　　——看朝鲜影片“沙道城的故事”后
    曹欣
    一千七百年前的一个百花盛开的春天，在朝鲜蔚蓝的东海岸上的沙道城，人民正为城堡主庆贺六十一岁寿辰，傲慢的阿罕在比武中卑劣地取了巧，并想借此来博取城堡主爱女——琴姬的欢心，但琴姬却爱慕着诚朴的舜知；舜知与琴姬在亭园里会面的时候被后母与阿罕发现了，舜知被革职回乡，同渔民们辛勤地劳动，每当日落，他总是吹奏着短笛，思念着琴姬；侵略者突然袭击了沙道浦，于老将军率阿罕等督战杀敌，结果阿罕被围，前线紧急，城堡主又病卧在床，琴姬决心替父出征，沙道浦人民则在舜知率领下奋起杀敌，双方会聚一处，舜知不念旧恶，在重围中救出阿罕，挽回了危局，琴姬与舜知在战斗中结成了美满的姻缘。
    这就是影片“沙道城的故事”的内容。这是由朝鲜著名舞蹈家崔承喜主演的一个舞剧记录片。艺术家们热情地歌颂了始终与人民在一起的、忠于祖国、忠于爱情的英雄人物。舞剧虽然没有任何语言作媒介，但我们从人物行动的历史中，深深理解了人物的性格思想和情感。舜知这个对人民谦逊朴实，不念旧恶，对敌人勇武善战，对爱情坚贞不移的人物形象给了我们很深的印象。我们又从琴姬身上看到了朝鲜妇女的优美善良的灵魂，她们为自己能与男子一起保卫自己的祖国而自傲，又那样鄙视那些为个人私利而傲慢无礼的小人。沙道城的故事是一首民族英雄的颂歌，是叙述坚贞不渝的爱情的诗篇。
      “沙道城的故事”在整理、发展民族舞蹈方面也获得了可喜的成就，它使叙事舞与表演舞无间地溶合在一起，使细致优美富有民族特色的舞蹈与质朴动人的乐曲和谐地统一在一个整体里面。剧中汇集了很多朝鲜最优秀的舞蹈，像古典
  “剑舞”，崔承喜同志近年来创作的独舞“虹”等。但在故事情节的发展中，我们甚至于无法找出它有丝毫不衔接之处，它溶汇一体地为全剧的发展而服务，为表现人物的内在情感而服务。表演舞也同时刻划了人物的性格，在比武的一段戏里，阿罕以轻率而蔑视对方的神情，任意挥剑起舞，击败对手的几个动作里，就深刻地反映了阿罕傲慢浮夸的性格，当他偷巧战胜了舜知，厚颜无耻以胜利自居去领取奖赏的时候，即使没有字幕的说明，通过这些性格化的舞蹈，我们已经清楚地能够认识这个人物了。
    饰演多情、勇敢的巾帼英雄——琴姬的崔承喜同志，她的每一个舞蹈动作，熟练地运用着形体动作的美来表现人物的思想感情，正因为她的舞蹈动作建筑在坚实的内心情感的基础上创造出来的，因此她的一举一动都显得那么自然、调和、优美，含藏那么丰富的舞蹈语言，那么深厚的感情。
    编导和美术、摄影工作者，又给全剧安排了一个真实而优美的环境，寿诞的礼堂，湖边的亭阁，捕鱼的海岸，誓师的城楼，激战的场地……这些场景既不限制舞蹈的进展，又有力烘托出了全剧的典型环境，造成了与剧情一致的氛围，特别是那些具有东方色彩的景物，更使我们感到亲切。
    我相信舞剧“沙道城的故事”将会给中国的舞蹈工作者以珍贵的启示，他们的丰富的创作经验也会有很多可供我们借鉴的。
