　　Do Not Allow Parasites to Harm Society
　　Russian Federation Formulating Laws to Combat Them
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 23rd, the Legislative Proposals Committee of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation has formulated a draft law "On Strengthening the Struggle Against Socially Harmful Parasitic Elements" and will submit it to a regular meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation for discussion.
    The preamble of the draft law states that Soviet society has eliminated the social foundation of some people enjoying the fruits of others' labor and has created real guarantees for the realization of the right to work for all. However, within the Soviet family that loves labor, there are still some people who live a parasitic life harmful to society. These people only pretend to work in their positions; they harm working people for their own benefit. They are idle all day long, begging for alms, and often violate laws and regulations. Society and the state should take resolute measures against such people.
    The clauses of the draft law stipulate that adult citizens who harm society, live a parasitic life, are capable of working, but deliberately evade socially useful labor, may, based on social judgment, be forcibly subjected to labor in a place of exile for two to five years in the form of exile.

　　不准寄生者危害社会
　　俄罗斯联邦正制订法案同他们作斗争
    据新华社莫斯科23日电　俄罗斯联邦最高苏维埃法案委员会制定了“关于加强同危害社会的寄生分子作斗争”的法案，并且将提交俄罗斯联邦最高苏维埃例会讨论。
    法案的序文说，苏维埃社会已经消灭了一些人坐享另一些人的劳动果实的社会基础，创造了实行全民享有劳动权的现实保障。但是，在爱好劳动的苏维埃大家庭中，有一些人还在过着危害社会的寄生生活。这些人摆在工作岗位上只是做做样子，他们损害劳动人民以利自己。终日游手好闲，央求施舍，并且常常违法乱纪。社会和国家应当对这种人采取坚决的措施。
    法案的条款中规定，对凡是危害社会、过寄生生活、有劳动力但是存心回避对社会有益的劳动的成年公民，可以根据社会判决，以流放的形式强制他们在流放地点劳动两年至五年。
