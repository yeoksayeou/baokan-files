　　A Great Harvest on the Ideological Front
　　Jiangxi Daily Reporter Zhang Xiping

　　Editor's Note: The anti-Rightist struggle is a socialist revolutionary movement on the political and ideological fronts. In this struggle, the broad masses of people have raised their socialist consciousness, and especially the broad masses of intellectuals have received extremely profound ideological education. In the struggle, their "eyes, noses, and ears seem to be much brighter and smoother." The abundant ideological fruits obtained by some engineering and technical personnel of the Jiangxi Provincial Water Conservancy Department in this struggle are a vivid illustration. The following article reflects these ideological gains in a relatively concrete way.

　　The following records a portion of the many rich fruits of growth in the ideological sphere of the people of the Jiangxi Provincial Water Conservancy Department during this anti-Rightist struggle. Such events have become commonplace phenomena in these extraordinary days, and as long as you pay attention to observation, they are also growing vigorously in each of our collectives and in each of us.

　　Not "Making a Fuss Over a Trifling Matter"

　　One day in early June, the wall posters of the symposium invited by the Party Group of the Provincial Water Conservancy Department for democratic figures and senior intellectuals in the department were posted again, and everyone scrambled to surround them and take a look. Technician Jiao Xiangqing also squeezed into the crowd. As he looked, he noticed that one person's speech stated: "The Chief Engineer's Office is the headquarters that controls the overall business of the entire department. In the past, the personnel allocation and usage rights belonged to the personnel department. In the future, the Chief Engineer's Office should have the power to decide… If the Chief Engineer's Office does not control the 'battle seal,' how can it command the battle?" Some suggested: "In the past, the cadres of the personnel department were required to have a clean history, and were mostly young girls and young people. This will not work in the future. We need to get some people who understand the ways of the world, that is, non-Party and non-League members, to go to the personnel department."

　　After reading the wall posters, Jiao Xiangqing thought: Everyone knows that an engineer is a technical title, and the Chief Engineer's Office plays the role of a technical staff. Why is someone now insisting that the Chief Engineer's Office should control personnel power, control the "battle seal," and play the role of "headquarters"? Where does the Party's leadership stand according to this statement? Why is such an opinion being put forward?

　　Questions churned in his mind. He went to discuss it with another technician, Fan Dezhong, who lived next door, and they also believed that these words were wrong. If they were allowed to spread, they would have very bad consequences for the Party's rectification and socialist construction. They were prepared to refute them.

　　However, at this time, the newspapers had not yet published articles criticizing the Rightists. Would doing so affect the "blooming" (of opinions)? They hesitated somewhat, and went to consult with others. Some said: "Those speeches also have certain reasons." Some smiled and said: "Why make a fuss over a trifling matter?" Others supported them. They considered: Without the Party's leadership, there would be no socialism. Since it was "letting a hundred flowers bloom," they had a responsibility to fight against these erroneous remarks in order to defend the Party and defend socialism. The next day, they righteously and confidently launched a rebuttal of the Rightist remarks at the group meeting, and then posted the first big-character poster, exposing the conspiracy of some people to attack the Party. At that time, when dark clouds were gathering, this action of firmly standing on the Party's position was like a watershed standing in a rapid current, separating the opinions helping the Party's rectification from the slander of the Rightists, and helping many people with blurred thinking maintain a clear head.

　　Before long, the People's Daily published an editorial criticizing the Rightists, and under the leadership of the Party, the comrades of the Water Conservancy Department set off a high tide of the anti-Rightist struggle. The ranks of the battle grew day by day, and Jiao Xiangqing and Fan Dezhong were the backbone of this team. In addition to completing their daily work, they also served as group meeting recorders, responsible for arranging big-character posters, and had to squeeze out time to write speeches in order to hit the Rightists' vital points. They and many comrades often worked until late at night. The weather was very hot, and sweat kept flowing from their faces, backs, and arms. In order to prevent the big-character posters from being soaked with sweat, they wrapped towels around their wrists and continued to write. On one or two occasions, when the big-character posters were finished, the east was about to turn white. They only lay down for a while, washed their faces with cold water, and went to work again. During the intense stage of the struggle, they persisted in this way for more than half a month, until the Rightist remarks were broken one by one, and the Rightists completely bowed their heads and confessed their guilt.

　　Exposing Lies with Facts

　　Li Shuzhong, a young technician of twenty-one years old, went on a business trip to the Jinhui Canal construction site in July last year, and returned to the office at the end of May this year. Ten months of intense engineering work had tempered this young man to be stronger. Not long after he returned to the office, he encountered the anti-Rightist struggle, and he unhesitatingly joined the ranks of the battle.

　　Once, at a general meeting, he heard a Rightist pretentiously say: "The leadership's bureaucracy is very serious, and they treat technical personnel like prisoners. Engineer ×'s heart disease was forced out during the construction of the Xi Liao Canal." Li Shuzhong was very unconvinced when he heard this. He had just returned from the construction site and, from personal experience, this was absolutely impossible.

　　In order to find conclusive facts to expose the Rightist's lies, he secretly took time during his rest to go to the Jiangxi Hospital where Engineer × had been treated to check his medical records. It turned out that there was no such thing as being forced to have heart disease during the construction of the Xi Liao Canal.

　　The next day, the Rightist was still complacent and used this fabricated fact to attack the Party and scold the leaders. Some people whispered sympathetically, and some were even angered by the lies. At this time, Li Shuzhong stood up calmly and introduced the medical records from the hospital, which recorded that this had not happened at all. This unexpected blow, like a heavy bomb, made the Rightist speechless and exposed the ugly face of the Rightist who fabricated rumors and slandered others on the spot.

　　Cannot Stand by as a Middle-of-the-Roader

　　When engineer Hu Guangxi was in college, he participated in the puppet Youth Army. After returning to school, he bragged to his classmates about how "brave" he was and how he had killed several people in the Youth Army. In fact, this was bragging. During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, others reported him based on these words. The organization investigated his history and sent people to inquire everywhere, finding seventeen people who were in the same company with him at the time, proving that he had not killed anyone. The organization concluded that he had not killed anyone.

　　This was originally a very good thing, but it was also used by the Rightists to distort the facts and slander the Party's movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries. They said: "There is an engineer in the Water Conservancy Department who was forced to say that he had killed several people during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries… If it weren't for Chairman Mao saying that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries should not wrong a single good person, he would not be able to survive."

　　When Hu Guangxi heard these words, he thought: Why are the Rightists using me as a tool to attack the Party? This must be because they think I am a "target" of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and usually don't pay much attention to politics. The Rightists are like poisonous snakes, eyeing my weaknesses and using them as their air-raid shelters.

　　The more he thought about it, the angrier he became, and the more he recognized the sinister, vicious, and despicable tricks of the Rightists. He said at the meeting: "The new China under the leadership of the Communist Party is a truly just society. The policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries is 100% correct, and the socialist road cannot be changed!" From then on, he threw himself into the heated anti-Rightist struggle. He said: "The Rightists have educated me. I can't stand by and watch as a middle-of-the-roader. They are like mad dogs. If you don't hit them, they will bite you."

　　From Onlooker to Warrior

　　In this anti-Rightist struggle, many old engineers and old technicians over half a century old with decades of work experience appeared. Many of them were "onlookers" in the Three-Anti, Five-Anti, and Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries movements, but this time they became brave warriors.

　　Although they are "newbies" on the battlefield, because they have broad social experience and insight into the origins and social relationships of the Rightists, coupled with the Party's education, their rebuttals have become powerful shells, both fierce and accurate.

　　For example, the Rightists nonsensically said that the Party cannot lead science and technology, and obliterated the achievements of the Party's leadership in various aspects with no conscience. Engineer Peng Shifan used his personal experience in water conservancy projects for nearly twenty years before and after liberation to ruthlessly shatter the fallacies of the Rightists.

　　Before liberation, Jiangxi Province had nothing to show for itself except for the dilapidated and precarious Wan'an Canal, which could only irrigate more than 10,000 mu of land. There were no design or survey materials with any scientific value. However, in the few years after liberation, in the irrigation project alone, we repaired the Wan'an Canal, and the irrigation area expanded to more than 40,000 mu. We also built new Anfu Canal, Chatantan Canal, Beiliao Canal, Xiliao Canal, Nanliao Canal, Baitadong Canal, Baitaxi Canal, Lilin Canal, Yihui Canal, Zoumapo, Jinhui Canal, etc. The construction by other special districts and counties are not included. Except for a few individual ones, the irrigation area of these projects is larger than the Wan'an Canal. Such tremendous achievements have never been seen at any time in history.

　　The iron facts aroused the sense of justice and patriotic enthusiasm of every upright citizen. The evil spirit of the Rightist evil no longer dared to raise its head.

　　Once, I met engineer Peng Shifan in the Water Conservancy Department. I asked him what was his deepest feeling in this anti-Rightist struggle.

　　He sincerely told me: "After this struggle, I feel more urgently than ever the need to get close to the Party and maintain the Party."

　　He said that as a senior intellectual and engineer, he had solved an ideological problem that had not been completely solved for several years: how to treat politics. In the past, he thought very naively: the Party is so strong that no one would think of overthrowing the Party's leadership. Therefore, he only emptily agreed with the Party and agreed with socialism, but did not know how to get close to the Party and maintain the socialist cause. This time, not only in various parts of the country, but also the Rightists were exposed around me. They organized and planned to overthrow the Party and destroy the socialist cause, which shocked me. I am an engineer, can I build on the one hand and watch others destroy on the other? He resolutely said: "No, I want to maintain socialism, and maintain the locomotive that leads us forward on the socialist road - the Party!"

　　Eyes, Noses, and Ears are Much Brighter and Smoother

　　An engineer told me in a casual conversation: "Now the eyes, nose, and ears seem to be much brighter and smoother. Whether something is beneficial or harmful to socialism can be distinguished by careful observation." He also told me a short story. A child in his neighborhood took the high school entrance examination, and one question was difficult and he couldn't do it. The child's parents complained and said: "The questions are too difficult. Isn't the country clearly telling you not to go to school?" He felt at that time that the words were wrong. Afterwards, he couldn't help it, and he found the neighbors and explained clearly to them according to the country's education policy. Although this is a trivial matter, if it were more than a month ago, he would not have even asked about it, and might even have echoed the neighbor's incorrect opinion.

　　Chen Zhicheng, the Secretary of the Party Group and Director of the Water Conservancy Department, received me. He said: "This time, we learned a lesson from the help of non-Party members, took a bath, and also exposed the Rightists in the great debate, improved our political sense of smell, and distinguished right from wrong."

### 思想战线上的大丰收

　　思想战线上的大丰收
　　江西日报记者　张希平
    编者按　反右派斗争是政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义革命运动。在这个斗争中，广大人民提高了社会主义的觉悟，特别是广大知识分子受到极为深刻的思想教育，他们在斗争中“眼睛、鼻子、耳朵好像都光亮顺畅得多了”。江西省水利厅的一些工程技术人员，在这次斗争中，思想上得到了许多丰硕的果实，就是一个生动的说明。下面这篇文章比较具体地反映了这种思想上的收获。
    下面记载的，是江西省水利厅在这次反右派斗争中，人们思想领域上成长的许多丰硕果实的一部分。这样的事，已成为这些不平常的日子里平常的现象，只要你注意观察，在我们每个集体，每个人的身上也都正在茁壮的成长。
    不是“小题大做”
    6月初的一天，省水利厅党组邀请厅内的民主人士和高级知识分子座谈的墙报又贴出了，大家都争先恐后围上来看。技术员焦祥清也挤在人丛中。他看着、看着，发现一个人的发言上写着：“总工程师室是掌握全厅业务的总司令部，过去人员调配和使用权属于人事部门，今后总工程师室应该有决定权……总工程师室不掌握兵符，怎么指挥作战呢？”有的提出：“过去人事部门的干部要历史清白，尽是些小姑娘、小青年，今后不行了，要弄些懂人情世故的即是非党非团的人到人事部门去。”
    焦祥清看了墙报，心里想：工程师是技术人员的职称，总工程师室起着技术参谋的作用，这是谁都知道的。为什么现在有人硬说总工程师室要掌握人事权，要掌握兵符，要起“司令部”的作用呢？按这说法，党的领导摆到什么地方去呢？为什么提出这样的意见来呢？
    疑问在他脑子里翻腾。他去同住在隔壁的另一个技术员范德众研究，也认为这些话不对头，若任其流播，会对党的整风和社会主义建设造成很坏的后果。他们准备批驳。
    但是，这时报纸上还没有刊登反击右派分子的文章，这样做是不是会影响放鸣呢？他们有些犹豫，又去找人商量。有的道：“那些发言也有一定道理。”有的笑笑说：“何必小题大做啊。”也有人是支持他们的。他们考虑：没有党的领导，就没有社会主义，既然是百家争鸣嘛，为了保卫党、保卫社会主义，就有责任和这些错误言论作斗争。第二天他俩就在小组会上理直气壮的对右派言论展开了驳斥，接着又贴出了第一张大字报，揭发某些人向党进攻的阴谋。在乌云密布的当时，这种坚决站在党的立场的行动，像屹立在急流中的一座分水岭，将帮助党整风的意见和右派分子别有用心的谰言，截然分划开来，使不少思想模糊的人，保持了清醒头脑。
    不几天，人民日报反击右派的社论刊出了，水利厅的同志在党领导下，掀起了反右派斗争高潮。战斗的队伍一天一天壮大，焦祥清、范德众是这支队伍里的骨干。他们除完成日常工作外，还担任了小组会记录，负责大字报编排，为了击中右派分子要害，自己还得挤出时间写发言稿。他们和许多同志常常忙到深夜。天气很热，汗从脸上、背上、手臂上不停地流下，为了不让大字报被汗水浸糊，他们用毛巾缠住手腕继续地写。有一两次大字报写完时，东方快发白了，他们只稍稍躺了一下，用冷水冲冲脸又上班去了。在斗争紧张的阶段里，就这样坚持了半个多月，直到右派言论一个个被击破，右派分子彻底低头认罪。
　  用事实揭穿谎言
    二十一岁年轻的技术员李述忠，是去年7月出差到锦惠渠施工，今年5月底回机关来的。十来个月紧张的工程，把这小伙子锻炼的更坚强了。他回到机关不几天就碰上了反右派斗争，他毫不犹豫地投入了战斗的行列。
    有一次开大会时，他听到一个右派分子装腔作势的说：“领导上官僚主义很严重，对待技术人员像俘虏一样，×工程师的心脏病就是在西潦渠施工时逼出来的。”李述忠听了很不服气，他刚从下面工地回来，从亲身体验，这是绝对不会有的事情。
    为了找出确凿的事实揭穿右派分子的谎言，他暗下在休息时间到×工程师看过病的江西医院去检查他的病历。原来根本就没有什么在西潦渠施工被逼出心脏病这回事。
    第二天，右派分子还在得意忘形地以这个捏造的事实，大肆攻击党，谩骂领导。有的人在同情地窃窃私语，有的甚至被谎言煽动得愤怒了。这时，李述忠不慌不忙地站了起来，将医院里记载的根本没有这回事情的病历，如实地介绍出来。这出乎意外的一击，像颗重磅炸弹，打得右派分子口呆舌结，当场揭穿了右派分子造谣中伤的丑恶面貌。
　  不能以中间分子的态度旁观了
    胡广熙工程师在大学念书的时候，参加过伪青年军，返校后他向同学们炫耀自己如何“勇敢”，在青年军时曾杀过几个人。其实这是吹牛的。肃反时别人根据这些话检举了他，组织上审查了他的历史，并派人四处了解，找到十七个当时和他同在一个连队的人，证明他没有杀过人。组织上给他作出没有杀过人的结论。
    这本来是一件很好的事情，可是也被右派分子颠倒黑白的用来污蔑党的肃反运动。说什么：“水利厅有个工程师肃反中被逼得乱说杀了几个人……如果不是毛主席说肃反不要冤枉一个好人的话，简直活不下去。”
    胡广熙听了这话，他想：为什么右派分子拿我做工具向党进攻呢？这一定是他们认为我是肃反“对象”，平时又不太过问政治的缘故，右派分子就像一条毒蛇一样，瞅准了我这弱点，用来作他们的防空洞。
    他越想越气，越认清了右派分子阴险毒辣可耻的伎俩。他在会上说：“共产党领导下的新中国，是一个真正有正义的社会。肃反政策百分之百的正确，社会主义道路不可更移！”从此，他投入了炽热的反右派斗争。他说：“右派分子教育了我，不能以中间分子的态度站在一旁观看了，他们像头疯狗样，你不打他，他就咬你。”
　  从旁观者到战将
    在这次反右派斗争中，出现了许多年过半百，有着几十年工作经历的老工程师、老技术员，其中许多人在三反、五反、肃反等运动中是“旁观者”，而这次却变成了骁勇的战将。
    他们虽然是战场上的“新手”，但因为他们社会经历广博，洞悉右派分子的出身和社会关系，再加上党的教育，所以他们的反驳就成了火力强大的炮弹，又猛、又准。
    比如右派分子瞎说党不能领导科学技术，灭绝良心地抹煞党在各方面所领导的成绩。工程师彭世藩就用他解放前后近二十年从事水利工程的亲身体验，无情地粉碎了右派分子的谬论。
    解放前，江西全省除了一座支离破碎，岌岌可危，只能灌溉一万多亩田的万安渠以外，拿不出一个像样的水利工程，连稍有科学价值的设计、勘察资料也没有。可是，在解放后几年来，仅灌溉工程一项，我们修复了万安渠，灌溉面积扩大到四万多亩，还新建了安福渠、槎滩渠、北潦渠、西潦渠、南潦渠、白塔东渠、白塔西渠、礼林渠、宜惠渠、走马坡、锦惠渠等，其他各专区和县修建的还不在内。这些工程除个别的以外，灌溉面积都比万安渠大。这样巨大的成绩，是亘古以来，任何时候所没有的。
    铁的事实，唤起了每一个正直公民的正义感和爱国热情。右派孽障的邪气再也抬不起头了。
    一次，我在水利厅遇到了彭世藩工程师，我问他，在这次反右派的斗争中，他最深刻的感觉是什么？
    他诚挚地告诉我：“经过这次斗争，比任何时候都迫切感到需要靠拢党、维护党。”
    他说，作为一个高级知识分子和工程师，他解决了一个几年来未彻底解决的思想问题：怎样对待政治。从前他想得很天真：党这样强大了，不会有人设想推翻党的领导的。因此，自己只空空洞洞的赞成党，赞成社会主义，但不知怎样靠拢党，维护社会主义事业。这次不仅在全国各地，而且也在我身边暴露出了右派分子，他们有组织有计划地推翻党，摧毁社会主义事业，使我大吃一惊。我是一个工程师，我能一面建设，一面看着别人破坏么？他毅然决然地说：“不能，我要维护社会主义，维护带领着我们在社会主义道路上前进的火车头——党！”
  　眼睛、鼻子、耳朵都光亮、顺畅得多了
    一位工程师在闲谈时告诉我：“现在眼睛、鼻子、耳朵好像都光亮顺畅得多了。对一件事情有利或有害于社会主义，只要仔细看看就能分辨得出。”他还给我说了一段小故事。他邻居有一个小孩考高中，有一道题目较难没有做出，孩子的家长就发牢骚说：“题目出的难，这不是国家明摆着不要你们升学。”他听了当时就感到话语不对，事后他怎么也忍不住了，他找到邻居根据国家的教育政策向他们解释清楚了。这虽然是一件微小的事情，如果在一个多月以前，他即使听了也不会过问，说不定还会附和这位邻居不正确的意见哩。
    水利厅的党组书记陈志诚厅长接待了我。他说：“这次我们从党外人士的帮助中，得到教训，洗了个澡，也在展开大辩论中，揭露了右派分子，提高了政治嗅觉，明辨了是非。”
