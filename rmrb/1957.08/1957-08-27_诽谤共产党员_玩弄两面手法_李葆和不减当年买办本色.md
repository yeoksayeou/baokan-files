Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, August 26th: Li Baohe, a member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association and Deputy Director of the Henan Provincial Department of Water Resources, has had his ugly words and deeds against the Communist Party and socialism exposed by staff members of the Water Resources Department. He is currently still stubbornly resisting, and everyone is continuing to reason and struggle with him.

According to revelations, Li Baohe and Zhang Naiqi had many years of political and economic connections. Li Baohe became a member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association because Zhang Naiqi strongly pulled him in. When the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association began to criticize Zhang Naiqi's bourgeois rightist ideology, Li Baohe went to Beijing to attend the meeting. After returning to Henan, he said to Guo Peiyun, Deputy Director of the Water Resources Department: "When I saw that the meeting was struggling against Zhang Naiqi, I felt very embarrassed. I came back before the meeting was over." Recently, Li Baohe went to Beijing again to attend the Central Committee meeting of the China Democratic National Construction Association. After returning, he defended Zhang Naiqi, saying: "Zhang Naiqi has already made a self-criticism. His is a problem of ideology, not a political problem. He is different from Luo Longji." He also deceived people by saying that he had exposed ten points about Zhang Naiqi at the meeting. In fact, he mainly repeated the materials already revealed in the newspapers, and only expressed some opinions on Zhang Naiqi's trafficking in antiques and cultural relics.

Li Baohe, this rightist element, often plays double-dealing tactics. Behind his back, he slandered Feng Zhijun, Deputy Director of the Water Resources Department, as having low cultural level and a simple style, but in front of Feng Zhijun, he pretended to compliment him, saying that Feng "has魄力(pòlì - courage and drive)". He instigated Guo Peiyun, Deputy Director of the Water Resources Department, saying: "People don't trust you." He slandered Peng Xiaolin, Director of the Water Resources Department, as being "biased."

During the period of "Great Blooming" and "Great Contending," Li Baohe maliciously attacked the leadership of the Communist Party and incited the masses to attack the Party. He fabricated rumors that leading cadres valued large-scale water conservancy projects over small-scale ones, and scolded cadres who implemented the Party's water conservancy construction policy as "doctrinaires." Disregarding the role of the Huai River project and other water conservancy projects in Henan Province after 1950, which had seen successive years of exceptionally heavy floods, he attempted to use the fallacy that "Henan Province's water conservancy projects are not many, not good, not fast, and not economical" to obliterate the achievements of water conservancy work. He attempted to negate the high degree of enthusiasm of peasants in digging wells and finding springs under the encouragement of socialist enthusiasm, and slandered the leading organs for adopting "the method of tightening the screws" towards the masses in the well-digging movement. He also insulted some leaders responsible for water conservancy work.

According to revelations, Li Baohe came from a landlord family and himself belonged to the comprador bourgeoisie. He once turned to the American General Motors Corporation and obtained the exclusive operating rights of General Motors in China. After he started working, he always kept a superficial relationship with the Communist Party and the People's Government. When he was the director of the Zhengzhou Machinery Factory, he vigorously cultivated personal forces and repeatedly appointed counter-revolutionary elements.

After the reactionary words and deeds of the rightist element Li Baohe were exposed, he took the opportunity to conduct a self-examination, greatly emphasizing his "achievements." This aroused even greater indignation among the staff of the Henan Provincial Department of Water Resources. Now, everyone is continuing to thoroughly expose and criticize him.

    诽谤共产党员　玩弄两面手法
　　李葆和不减当年买办本色
    新华社郑州26日电　民主建国会中央委员、河南省水利厅副厅长李葆和的反对共产党、反对社会主义的丑恶言行，已经被水利厅工作人员揭露出来。目前他还在狡赖顽抗，大家正在同他继续进行说理斗争。
    据揭露，李葆和和章乃器在政治上和经济上有多年的联系。李葆和成为民主建国会中央委员，就是章乃器极力拉拢起来的。民主建国会中央开始批判章乃器的资产阶级右派思想时，李葆和去北京参加了会议。他回到河南后，对水利厅副厅长郭培鋆说：“这次开会，我一看是斗争章乃器，弄得我左右为难，我没等会议开完就回来了。”最近，李葆和又到北京参加民主建国会中央会议，回来后为章乃器辩护说：“章乃器已经做了检讨，他是思想问题，不是政治问题。他和罗隆基不一样。”他又欺骗人们说，他在会上揭露章乃器十条。其实他主要是重复报纸上已经揭露的材料，只在章乃器贩买古董文物这样的事情上说了点意见。
    李葆和这个右派分子是经常玩弄两面手法的。他在背后诽谤水利厅副厅长冯智俊文化低，作风简单，当着冯智俊的面却假意恭维，说冯“有魄力”。他向水利厅副厅长郭培鋆挑拨说：“人家不信任你。”他污蔑水利厅厅长彭晓林“有偏心”。
    在大“放”大“鸣”期间，李葆和恶意攻击共产党的领导，煽动群众向党进攻。他造谣说领导干部对水利工程重大型、轻小型，辱骂执行党的水利建设方针的干部是“教条主义者”。他不顾河南省在1950年后连年出现特大洪水的情况下治淮工程和其他水利工程发挥的作用，竟企图用“河南省的水利工程也不多，也不好，也不快，也不省”的谰言来抹煞水利工作的成绩。他企图否定农民在社会主义热情鼓舞下打井下泉的高度积极性，污蔑领导机关在打井运动中对群众采取“把螺丝上紧的办法”。他还辱骂一些领导水利工作的负责人。
    据揭露，李葆和出身于地主家庭，本人属于买办资产阶级。他曾投靠美国通用汽车公司，取得通用汽车公司在华的独一经营权。他参加工作后，一直和共产党、人民政府貌合神离。他在郑州机械厂当厂长时，大力培植私人势力，多次任用反革命分子。
    右派分子李葆和的反动言行被揭露出来后，他竟借检查之名，大表其“功”。这就激起了河南省水利厅工作人员更大的义愤。现在，大家正继续对他进行彻底的揭发和批判。
