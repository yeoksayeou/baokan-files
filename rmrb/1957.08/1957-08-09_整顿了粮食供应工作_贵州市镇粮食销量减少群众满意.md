    Grain Supply Work Rectified
    Grain Sales in Guizhou Towns and Cities Decrease, Public Satisfied
    (Our Newspaper News) The rectification of grain supply work in 156 towns and cities in Guizhou Province has been completed. After the rectification, not only was the rational supply of grain ensured, but also irrational sales were reduced. Currently, the market supply is normal, and the public is satisfied.
    Starting from December last year, all parts of the province, with the grain departments as the main force, under the unified leadership of the local Party and government, and relying on the masses, first ascertained the actual population, whether the original quotas were reasonable, and the reasons for loose systems. Then, according to the spirit of “more reduction for those who should be reduced more, less reduction for those who should be reduced less, and appropriate increase for individual low quotas,” the objects and quantities of adjustment were studied, and finally, the plan was finalized through mass discussion. After seven months of work, the town and city supply situation in the province after the rectification is: the population with quotas increased, and labor categories increased; the quota level decreased, and actual sales decreased. According to the statistics of 66 towns and cities including Anshun, Zunyi, Tongzi, Zhenyuan, and Bijie, the population with quotas increased by 2.65% after the rectification compared to before the rectification; the quota level was reduced from the original 25 jin to 24.74 jin, and the population with quotas in the labor categories of university, middle school students and above increased by 3.45% compared to before; the number of livestock supplied with quotas increased by 12.17% compared to before, and the monthly supply per head decreased by 4.03 jin compared to before; according to the statistics of 17 counties and cities, industry grain consumption in the first quarter of this year decreased by 15.63% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. The province's town and city supply in the first quarter of this year decreased by 6.6% compared to the fourth quarter of last year, and sales in the second quarter were normal.
    However, because some cadres were not clear enough about the purpose and requirements of the rectification work, and there was a fear of trouble and a large workload, some areas confused the compression of unreasonable sales with saving grain, and the compressed grain was not specifically assigned to individuals; some areas did not reduce unreasonable sales after rectification, such as according to statistics from November 1954 to March 1957, about 2.1 million jin of nationally circulated grain coupons, 22.37 million jin of local grain coupons, and 3.84 million jin of local feed coupons in the province were not recovered. Therefore, it is still necessary to continue to improve the work.

### 整顿了粮食供应工作  贵州市镇粮食销量减少群众满意

    整顿了粮食供应工作
    贵州市镇粮食销量减少群众满意
    本报讯　贵州全省一百五十六个市镇的粮食供应整顿工作已经结束。经过整顿，不仅保证了粮食的合理供应，而且压缩了不合理的销量，目前市场供应正常，群众满意。
    从去年12月份起，全省各地以粮食部门为主，在当地党、政统一领导下，依靠群众首先摸清实际人口、原定量是否合理、制度松弛的原因等情况。接着根据
  “该多降的就多降，该少降的就少降，个别定量偏低的适当提高”的精神，研究了调整对象和数量，最后通过群众讨论定案。经过七个月的工作，全省整顿后的市镇供应情况是：定量人口增加，劳动类别上升；定量水平下降，实际销量减少。据安顺、遵义、桐梓、镇远、毕节等六十六个城镇的统计，整顿后较整顿前定量人口上升2.65％；定量水平由原二十五斤调低为二十四点七四斤，大、中学生以上的劳动类别的定量人口较前增加3.45％；定量供应的牲畜头数较前增加12.17％，每头每月的供应量较前降低了四点零三斤；据十七个县市的统计，行业用粮今年第一季度较去年第四季度降低了15.63％。今年全省第一季度的市镇供应量较去年第四季度下降了6.6％，第二季度的销量正常。
    但是由于某些干部对整顿工作的目的和要求不够明确，存在着怕麻烦怕工作量大的思想，因而有的地区将压缩不合理销量与节约粮食混淆起来，压缩的粮食没有具体到人；有的地区经过整顿，不合理的销量没有压下来，如据1954年11月到1957年3月的统计，全省约有全国通行的粮票二百一十万斤、地方粮票二千二百三十七万斤、地方料票三百八十四万斤没有收回来。因此，仍需继续改进工作。
