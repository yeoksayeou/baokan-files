Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 3rd: The Soviet Foreign Ministry issued a statement on August 2nd stating that the main intention of the joint declaration on the German question signed by the United States, Britain, France, and West Germany in Berlin on July 29th is obviously to entangle the issue of disarmament with the German question, in order to sabotage the ongoing disarmament negotiations.

The statement pointed out that any steps taken by Western countries in the area of disarmament depend on whether such steps hinder the realization of Western countries' plans to establish a militaristic unified Germany and to make Germany join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Because Western countries' governments have proposed resolving the German question as a prerequisite, the resolution of the most important and urgent disarmament issue has been constrained.

The Soviet Foreign Ministry pointed out that the governments of the United States, Britain, and France did not put forward any suggestions in the Berlin joint declaration that would be beneficial to the reunification of Germany. This declaration is merely a carefully considered competitive trick, the purpose of which is to maintain the position of Adenauer and his party in the upcoming parliamentary elections in West Germany.

The statement said that the Soviet government has always been prepared to support all efforts made by the German people to establish a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany. The Soviet Union is prepared to provide such a peace-loving Germany with the necessary guarantees to safeguard its independence and the peace and security of Europe.

The statement pointed out that the West German government is not, as stated in the Four Powers Berlin joint declaration, the "only government entitled to speak on behalf of all the German people." Besides it, there is also the German Democratic Republic, which safeguards the national interests of the German people and truly hopes that Germany will be reunified into a peace-loving and democratic country. Therefore, "the question of German unification cannot be resolved by foreign countries behind the backs of the German people and at the expense of the interests of either of the two Germanys."

The statement said that Western countries and the West German government are attempting to play the slogan of all-German elections, striving to portray this as an appropriate way to unify the two Germanys. However, under the current German situation, holding all-German elections is impossible.

The Soviet government believes that the German Democratic Republic government's proposal to establish a German Federation creates realistic conditions for breaking the deadlock on the German unification issue, which is beneficial to the German people and to consolidating peace in Europe.

### 苏联外交部指责美英法和西德联合宣言  西方想借德国问题破坏裁军谈判

    苏联外交部指责美英法和西德联合宣言 
    西方想借德国问题破坏裁军谈判
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联外交部8月2日发表声明说，美国、英国、法国和西德7月29日在柏林签署的关于德国问题的联合宣言的主要用意，显然是想把裁军问题同德国问题纠缠在一起，以便破坏目前正在进行的裁军谈判。
    声明指出，西方国家在裁军方面采取任何步骤，都是以这个步骤是否阻碍西方国家关于建立军国主义的统一的德国以及使德国加入北大西洋公约组织这样一些计划的实现为转移的。由于西方国家政府提出以解决德国问题作为先决条件，就使得最重要的刻不容缓的裁军问题的解决受到了牵制。
    苏联外交部指出，美、英、法三国政府在柏林联合宣言里没有提出任何有益于重新统一德国的建议。这个宣言不过是一个经过深思熟虑的竞选手腕，其目的是想保持阿登纳和他的党在西德即将举行的议会选举中的地位。
    声明说，苏联政府一直准备支持德国人民为建立一个统一、民主和爱好和平的德国所作的一切努力。苏联准备向这样一个爱好和平的德国提供必要的保障，以维护它的独立和欧洲的和平及安全。
    声明指出，西德政府并不像四国柏林联合宣言中所说的是一个“有权代表全体德国人民说话的唯一政府”。除了它以外，德国还存在着一个维护德国人民的民族利益、真正希望德国重新统一成一个爱好和平和民主的国家的德意志民主共和国。因此，“德国统一的问题不可能由外国背着德国人民并且牺牲两个德国中任何一国的利益而加以解决”。
    声明说，西方国家和西德政府企图玩弄全德选举的口号，力求把这说成是统一两个德国的适当方式。然而，在目前的德国局势下举行全德选举是不可能的。
    苏联政府认为，德意志民主共和国政府关于成立德国联邦的建议，为打破德国统一问题僵局创造了现实条件，这个建议既有利于德国人民，也有利于巩固欧洲的和平。
