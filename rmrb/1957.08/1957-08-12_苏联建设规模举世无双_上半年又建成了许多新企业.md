    Moscow Dispatch from our newspaper, August 11th: The Soviet Union is undertaking large-scale construction unmatched anywhere in the world. Investment in capital construction in the first half of 1957 alone reached 79 billion rubles, exceeding the total capital investment of 61.6 billion rubles during the entire First Five-Year Plan period. Many new enterprises were completed in the first half of this year. The Voroshilov and Makeyevka steel plants added large blast furnaces, the Krivoy Rog steel plant added wire rolling mills, the Baku steel pipe plant added primary rolling mills, and the Cherepovets steel plant added coking ovens. Two more turbines at the Kuibyshev hydroelectric station became operational, bringing the power generation capacity to nearly 1.5 million kilowatts. 100,000-kilowatt turbines began operating at thermal power plants in Mironovo, Voroshilovgrad, Slavyansk, and other locations. In Ukraine alone, four iron mines and ten coal mines were put into production.
    Housing construction in the Soviet Union is truly advancing rapidly. In the first half of this year, the state completed more than 9 million square meters of housing. The movement of workers building their own housing using local materials and enterprise resources is developing in many cities. The call recently put forward by the Soviet Party and government to meet the housing needs of residents within twelve years is giving new impetus to housing construction.
    The reorganization of the Soviet industrial and construction management system has created favorable conditions for the further development of construction. More than 3,000 construction and installation units have been transferred to the management of the National Economic Committees of various economic regions. Many construction units in the same locality have been merged, thereby eliminating the previous phenomenon of several construction units building houses on the same street, increasing the speed of construction. Following the reorganization of the management system, 500 design units will be transferred to the jurisdiction of the union republics, bringing design closer to regional construction. At the same time, in order to combine research work with concrete construction needs, many scientific institutions formerly belonging to specialized ministries and the Academy of Construction have been transferred to the republics and National Economic Committees.
    The speed of Soviet construction is constantly increasing. A few years ago, it took two years to build a blast furnace; now it only takes seven or eight months. Industrialized construction methods have greatly shortened construction time: normally, it takes one or two years to build a five-story building, but with prefabricated components, it only takes four months. The production of reinforced concrete components is constantly increasing. In the first half of this year, 5.9 million cubic meters were produced, more than the total output for the entire year of 1955.

    苏联建设规模举世无双
    上半年又建成了许多新企业
    本报莫斯科11日电　苏联进行着举世无双的大规模建设。基本建设的投资仅仅在1957年上半年就达到七百九十亿卢布，这超过第一个五年计划时期为数六百一十六亿卢布的基本投资总额。今年上半年建成了许多新的企业。伏罗希洛夫和马克也夫钢铁厂增加了大高炉，克里沃罗格钢铁厂增加了线材轧机，巴库钢管厂增加了初轧机，切列波维次钢铁厂增加了炼焦炉。古比雪夫水电站又有两个涡轮机工作，使发电力达到将近一百五十万瓩。在米罗诺沃、沃罗希洛夫格勒、斯拉维安斯克等地热电厂都有十万瓩的涡轮机开始工作。仅仅在乌克兰就有四个铁矿和十个煤矿投入生产。
    苏联住宅建筑真有一日千里之势。今年上半年由国家建成了九百多万平方公尺的住宅。利用地方材料和企业力量，由职工自己动手建筑住宅的运动，在许多城市发展着。苏联党和政府最近提出的在十二年内满足居民住宅需要的号召，给住宅建筑以新的推动力。
    苏联工业和建设管理制度的改组，为建设的进一步发展创造了有利条件。已经有三千多个建设和安装单位移交给各个经济区的国民经济委员会管理，同一地方的许多建筑单位合并了，因而消除了以往一条街上有几个建筑单位在盖房子的分散现象。提高着建筑的速度。在管理制度改组以后，前后将有五百个设计单位移交加盟共和国管辖，这将使设计接近地区的建设。同时，为了使研究工作与具体建设需要相结合，许多原属专业部和建筑科学院的科学机关移交共和国和国民经济委员会。
    苏联建筑速度不断提高。几年前建筑一座高炉要两年，现在只要七、八个月。工业化建筑方法大大缩短了建筑的时间：平常一座五层楼房要盖一两年，用预装构件只花四个月就盖成了。钢筋混凝土构件的生产不断增加，今年上半年生产了五百九十万立方公尺，比1955年全年产量还多。
