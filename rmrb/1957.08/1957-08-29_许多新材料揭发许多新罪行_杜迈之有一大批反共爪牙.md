　　Many New Materials Expose Many New Crimes
　　Du Maizhi Has a Large Group of Anti-Communist Accomplices

    Xinhua News Agency dispatch by reporter Hu Jian: Du Maizhi, the "special envoy" of the Zhang-Luo Alliance in Hunan Province, an alternate member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, and Secretary-General of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, and the right-wing group headed by him, have recently been exposed with many new materials.

  It has been revealed that Du Maizhi had close relationships with right-wing elements of the China Democratic League Central Committee, such as Luo Longji, Chen Xingui, Pan Guangdan, and Chen Renbing, for a long time. Since Du Maizhi took actual charge of the China Democratic League affairs in Hunan Province in the second half of 1955, he has actively worked to realize the anti-Communist and anti-socialist conspiracies of the Zhang-Luo Alliance. His accomplices and conspirators are spread almost throughout all universities, literary and art circles, and journalistic circles in the province. For example, in the provincial and municipal literary and art circles, there is the "Literary Salon" anti-Communist group headed by Kang De, Deputy Director of the Changsha Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League and Director of the Changsha Municipal Bureau of Culture; accomplices in universities include Chen Xinmin, member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League and President of the Central South Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, etc. During the rectification campaign, Du Maizhi also sent a group of henchmen to light fires everywhere in the provincial and municipal literary and art circles and in universities and middle schools, and conspired with Chen Xinmin and others to establish an anti-Communist and anti-socialist headquarters for universities—the "Higher Education Work Committee." Chen Xinmin was already internally designated as the director of this committee, with Lin Zhaozong (Vice President of Hunan Normal College and Deputy Director of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League), Hu Weibai (Professor of the Central South Institute of Mining and Metallurgy and member of the China Democratic League), Xie Shicheng (Professor of the Central South Institute of Civil Engineering and Architecture and member of the China Democratic League), and others as members, and Du Maizhi personally "supervised the battle." The evil claws of Du Maizhi's right-wing group have also extended to small and medium-sized cities throughout the province. For example, right-wing elements such as Qu Zijian, Director of the Hengyang Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, and Liu Wenbing, Director of the Changde Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, are all his accomplices.

    At the end of last year, Du Maizhi arrogantly clamored: "China's political system will change, and the status of democratic parties in the country's political life will be greatly different." He advocated that the China Democratic League should become a large party, an "opposition party" to the Communist Party, believing that this would "make it easier to put on a rival show with the Communist Party and play a supervisory role over the Communist Party." He even arrogantly clamored: "It is not necessarily true that there would be no New China without the Communist Party."

    During the rectification campaign, he and his accomplices launched a frenzied attack on the Communist Party on major issues such as the leadership system of universities, the science system, the policy towards intellectuals, and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, echoing the Zhang-Luo Alliance. He actively advocated abolishing the school Party committee system and, at the same time, actively organized discussions on the reactionary science program planned by the Zhang-Luo Alliance. In April of this year, after Du Maizhi returned from Beijing after accepting instructions from the "generals" of the Zhang-Luo Alliance, Zeng Zhaolun and Qian Weichang, regarding the discussion of scientific system issues, he summoned Chen Xinmin, Hu Weibai, and others during the provincial propaganda meeting to convey the instructions of Zeng and Qian, secretly plotting how to organize the discussion, and proposed that the focus of the discussion be on whether the Academy of Sciences could lead the national scientific research work. Du Maizhi conveyed: "The Academy of Sciences has a large organization, with an army but no generals, the army is made up of baby soldiers, not effective, and cannot take on the task of being the locomotive." In addition to personally conveying instructions and organizing discussions in the China Democratic League organizations of various universities, Du Maizhi also sent full-time cadres to collect opinions everywhere, requiring that the opinions be sorted out and sent to Beijing before May 10 as materials for right-wing elements such as Zeng and Qian to formulate reactionary scientific programs.

    It has been revealed that Du Maizhi also actively supported Luo Longji's proposal to establish a "Rehabilitation Committee." He had repeatedly sent people to collect materials from the targets of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and he clamored that "if democratic parties participate in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, there will be fewer problems." He also vigorously promoted inflammatory fallacies such as "the issue of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries is a nationwide issue" and "someone in Beijing has proposed rehabilitation." On the issue of the Party's policy towards intellectuals, he even more viciously attacked it. He openly clamored: "The situation has changed now, intellectuals must be re-evaluated, and there will be fundamental changes in policy." "Whether the current policy of unity, education, and transformation is suitable needs everyone's discussion." Attempting to incite intellectuals' dissatisfaction with the Party's ideological remolding policy, so that he could capture more people as his tools for opposing the Communist Party.

    In addition, Du Maizhi also launched vicious attacks on the Communist Party on issues such as teaching reform and wage reform. Du Maizhi also actively planned to publish a "colleague newspaper" with right-wing elements Kang De, Wei Mengke, and others, so as to put on a "rival show" with the New Hunan Daily, the organ of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China. He also strongly supported the evil activities of the "Literary Salon" headed by Kang De in opposing the Communist Party and socialism, attempting to usurp the Party's leadership from many aspects.

    Now, Du Maizhi's conspiracies have been exposed by the masses, and the right-wing group headed by him has also collapsed and become isolated. The broad masses are pursuing the victory and continuing to attack.

　  许多新材料揭发许多新罪行
　　杜迈之有一大批反共爪牙
    新华社讯　新华社记者胡坚报道：章罗联盟在湖南省的“特派员”——民盟候补中央委员、民盟湖南省委秘书长杜迈之和以他为首的右派集团，最近又被揭露出许多新的材料。
  据揭露，杜迈之很早就和民盟中央右派分子罗隆基、陈新桂、潘光旦、陈仁炳等人关系密切。从1955年下半年杜迈之实际负责湖南盟务以来，他就积极为实现章罗联盟的反共反社会主义的阴谋奔走。他的羽翼和同谋者，几乎散布全省各高等学校、文艺界和新闻界。例如，在省市文艺界有以民盟长沙市委副主任委员、长沙市文化局局长康德为首的“文艺沙龙”反共集团；在高等学校的同谋者有民盟中央委员、中南矿冶学院院长陈新民等。在整风期间，杜迈之还派了一批爪牙分别在省市文艺界和大、中学校中到处点火，并同陈新民等阴谋筹划成立高等学校反共反社会主义司令部——“高教工作委员会”，已内定陈新民为这个委员会的主任，林兆倧（湖南师范学院副院长、民盟湖南省委副主任委员）、胡为柏（中南矿冶学院教授、民盟盟员）、谢世澄（中南土木建筑学院教授、民盟盟员）等为委员，由杜迈之亲自“督战”。杜迈之右派集团的魔掌还伸到了全省的中小城市。例如民盟衡阳市委主任委员屈子健、民盟常德市委主任委员刘文炳等右派分子，都是他的爪牙。
    在去年年底，杜迈之就狂妄地叫嚣说：“中国的政治制度将有改变，民主党派在国家政治生活中的地位将大大地不同了。”他主张民盟要成为一个大党派，要成为共产党的“反对派”，他认为这样“才好和共产党唱对台戏，才好对共产党起监督作用”。他甚至狂妄地叫嚣说：“不见得没有共产党就没有新中国”。
    在整风期间，他和他的同谋者在有关高等学校领导体制、科学体制、对待知识分子政策和肃反工作等重大问题上，和章罗联盟一唱一和地向共产党发起了猖狂进攻。他积极主张取消学校党委制，同时，积极组织讨论章罗联盟策划的反动科学纲领。今年4月间，杜迈之在北京接受章罗联盟“大将”曾昭抡、钱伟长关于讨论科学体制问题的指示回来以后，就在省宣传会议期间约集陈新民、胡为柏等人传达曾、钱的指示，密谋策划如何组织讨论，并提出讨论重点是科学院能否领导全国科学研究工作问题。杜迈之传达说：“科学院机关庞大，有三军而无将领，三军是娃娃兵，不顶事，不能担任火车头的任务。”杜迈之除了亲自到各高等学校民盟组织中传达指示、组织讨论外，并派专职干部到处搜集讨论的意见，限在5月10日前将意见整理寄北京，作为曾、钱等右派分子制订反动科学纲领的资料。
    据揭露杜迈之还积极支持罗隆基成立“平反委员会”的主张。他曾经多次派人向肃反斗争对象搜集材料，并扬言“肃反工作如果有民主党派参加，问题就会少些。”他还大肆宣扬“肃反问题是全国性问题”、“北京已有人提出平反”等煽动性的谬论。在对党的知识分子政策问题上，他更加恶毒地大肆攻击。他公开叫嚣说：“现在形势变了，对知识分子要重新估价，政策将有原则性的变更”。“现在团结、教育、改造的政策是否适合，须要大家讨论”。企图挑拨知识分子对党的思想改造政策的不满，以便他俘虏更多的人作为他反共的工具。
    此外，在教学改革、工资改革等问题上，杜迈之也对共产党进行了恶毒的攻击。杜迈之还同右派分子康德、魏猛克等积极筹划出版“同人报”，以便同中共湖南省委机关报新湖南报唱“对台戏”。他并且极力支持以康德为首的“文艺沙龙”的反共反社会主义的罪恶活动，企图从多方面来篡夺党的领导权。
    现在杜迈之的阴谋活动已被群众揭穿，以他为首的右派集团也已经土崩瓦解，陷于孤立。广大群众正乘胜追击中。
