(Dispatch from our newspaper in Xi’an on July 31st) The Shaanxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has held meetings and symposiums in recent days to expose and criticize Jing Ruiqing, the deputy director of the cooperative and the chairman of the China Democratic League's provincial supply and marketing cooperative branch, for organizing a right-wing clique and engaging in anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds.

After the Party began its rectification campaign, Jing Ruiqing believed that the time to attack the Party had arrived. Based on the right-wing elements within the China Democratic League, he actively organized an anti-Party clique, and he also roped in those who had been struggled against during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and those who were dissatisfied with the Party to attack the Party, using the China Democratic League's Shaanxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative branch as his anti-Party headquarters. He convened continuous branch meetings, mobilizing members to attack the Party on one hand, and specifically collecting individual shortcomings and errors of the Party in its work on the other.

He not only used the collected materials to directly attack the Party, but also reported them in writing and orally to Kang Xinzai, the chairman of the China Democratic League's Xi'an Municipal Committee and a right-wing element. Kang Xinzai then used these untrue reports to attack the Party.

Jing Ruiqing also instructed Cui Chongren, the head of a China Democratic League team, to tell Deputy Director Liu Hua (a Party member) that when giving opinions, he should not talk about trivial issues, but should touch him on matters of principle. He and members of the clique separately roped in and incited some people outside the China Democratic League who were dissatisfied with the Party to act as their hatchet men. When he read big-character posters, he incited people by saying, "The masses in some organizations have dismissed the heads of departments and elected their own leaders." He attempted to incite the masses to overthrow the leadership.

Since mid-June, the Shaanxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has held continuous meetings to reason with those who made anti-socialist remarks. Under the circumstances that they were at a loss for words, the members of Jing Ruiqing's clique and those incited by Jing rebelled one after another, and the face of this anti-Party and anti-people clique headed by Jing Ruiqing was fully exposed. Subsequently, large and small meetings were continuously held to specifically expose and refute Jing Ruiqing's anti-Party words and deeds. Li Yuzhang and more than 20 others refuted his anti-Party remarks with facts. For example, his claim that he had a title but no power and that he could not see telegrams was completely a lie. The Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative had a total of three directors, who were responsible for leading 23 departments. Jing led nine of these departments, and the official documents of these departments could only be issued after he decided and signed them. The council is the highest authority of the cooperative. Last year, it held a total of 58 meetings, 21 of which were chaired by Jing and he gave the final summary. Doesn't this count as having power? Participants in the meeting also presented a rectification plan signed and commented on by Jing, questioning him why he said he didn't know the rectification plan. Some people also examined the telegrams within Jing's business scope, and they all had the date he signed and read them, but he shouted everywhere that people outside the Party could not see the telegrams. Wang Jucai cited vivid facts to refute Jing Ruiqing's fallacies such as "the suppression of counter-revolutionaries was making a fuss over a trifle" and "it was messed up." He said that the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative found 25 counter-revolutionaries and bad elements in the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, investigated and clarified 15 people who originally belonged to the category of counter-revolutionaries but were not treated as such due to the policy of leniency, and also clarified the political history and serious ideological and work style problems of 41 people through the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, relieving these people of their political history and ideological burdens.

Under everyone's reasonable refutation, Jing Ruiqing had to admit that he had committed anti-Party and anti-socialist errors, but he avoided talking about the ideological roots of his anti-Party and anti-socialist behavior and the fact that he organized a right-wing clique.

    陕西省供销社揭发一个向党进攻的小集团
    职工摆事实驳倒景瑞卿
    本报西安31日电　陕西省供销社连日召开大会和座谈会，揭发和批判该社副主任、民盟省供销社支部主任委员景瑞卿组织右派小集团，进行反党反社会主义的言行。
    在党开始整风以后，景瑞卿认为向党进攻的时候已到，就以盟内的右派分子为基础积极组织反党小集团，并拉拢肃反中被斗过的和对党不满的分子，向党进攻，把民盟陕西省供销社支部作为他的反党指挥部。他曾连续召开支部会议，一面动员盟员向党进攻，一面专门搜集党在工作中的个别缺点和错误。
    他不仅利用搜集到的材料直接向党进攻，并且用书面和口头汇报给民盟西安市主任委员、右派分子亢心栽，亢心栽就用这些不真实的汇报材料向党进攻。
    景瑞卿还指示民盟小组长崔崇仁给刘华副主任（党员）提意见不要谈枝节问题，要在原则上触动他。他和小集团的成员分别拉拢和煽动一些盟外对党不满的人，充当他们的打手。他在看大字报时煽动说：“有的机关群众把处长都罢免了，自己选出了领导。”企图煽动群众起来推翻领导。
    6月中旬以来，陕西省供销社连续开会对发表反社会主义言论的人进行说理斗争，在理屈词穷的情况下，景瑞卿小集团的分子和被景煽动的人纷纷起义，这个以景瑞卿为首的反党反人民的小集团的面貌全部暴露出来了。接着，又连续召开大会小会，专门揭露和驳斥景瑞卿的反党言行。李予章等二十多人用事实驳斥了他散布的反党言论。如景说他有职无权，看不到电报等完全是谎言。省供销社共三个主任，分工领导二十三个处室，景就领导九个处，这些处的公文都是由他决定签字后才能发。理事会是合作社的最高权力机关，去年共开了五十八次会，其中有二十一次由景主持并作最后总结，这还不算有权吗？参加会议的人还拿出景签过字并提过意见的整风计划，质问他为什么说不知道整风计划。有些人还检查了景业务范围内的电报，上边也都有他签注的阅读日期，而他却到处喊党外人士看不到电报。王巨才举出了活生生的事实批驳景瑞卿所谓“肃反是小题大作”、“搞糟了”等谬论。他说，省供销社在肃反运动中检查出二十五名反革命分子和坏分子，清查出本属于反革命，由于宽大政策不以反革命论处的十五人，并且通过肃反弄清了四十一个有比较严重的政治历史和严重思想作风问题的人，给这些人卸掉政治历史和思想包袱。
    在大家据理驳斥下，景瑞卿不得不承认他犯了反党反社会主义的错误，但是对他反党反社会主义的思想根源及组织右派小集团的事实却避而不谈。
