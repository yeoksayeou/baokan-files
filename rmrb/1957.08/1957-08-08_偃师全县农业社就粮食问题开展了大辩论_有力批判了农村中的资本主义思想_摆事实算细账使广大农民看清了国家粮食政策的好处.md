Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, July 7th (Reporter Zhou Yuan): Just as the summer harvest, distribution, and planting work are extremely busy, a major debate on grain issues has unfolded in various agricultural cooperatives in Yanshi County, Henan Province. This debate has given every farmer a profound socialist education.

More than 400,000 farmers in Yanshi County joined advanced agricultural cooperatives in the socialist upsurge of May last year. With the farmers' enthusiasm for production coupled with favorable weather, they achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in the summer. On average, each member of the county received 250 jin of grain in the pre-distribution, with some receiving as much as 500 to 600 jin. This year's winter wheat, due to six consecutive months of drought, yielded 230 jin per mu, slightly lower than the 271 jin per mu in 1956. Therefore, when the wheat ripened, the members knew that this year's harvest would be lower than last year's, and the distribution would be lower than last summer's, and they began to discuss it. Some well-to-do middle peasants took the opportunity to negate the state's unified purchase and sale system for grain. Some farmers, dissatisfied with the reduced distribution because they had not joined the cooperatives for long and were unaccustomed to the production and distribution system of the agricultural cooperatives, also supported the erroneous views of the well-to-do middle peasants, criticizing the state's grain policy.

    Some Farmers Have Opinions on Summer Harvest Distribution
    Well-to-do Middle Peasants Take the Opportunity to Attack the Unified Purchase and Sale Policy

The well-to-do middle peasants first went to the streets and said, "The Communist Party is good at everything, except letting people eat their fill." They deliberately brought sweet potato noodles to the streets and said, "Come and see the food of socialism." Of the thirteen farmers who took the lead in causing trouble in the Sibei Agricultural Cooperative in Temple, eleven were well-to-do middle peasants and middle peasants. Of the twenty-four people who stirred up criticism of the state's grain policy in Jia Village, fifteen were well-to-do middle peasants and middle peasants. During this period, the well-to-do middle peasants fully used their economic influence over the broad masses of farmers to make the agricultural cooperatives seem extremely disheartening. Some bad elements also used the erroneous words and deeds of the well-to-do middle peasants to spread rumors and incite trouble. They even pointed fingers and attacked the Party, cadres, agricultural cooperatives, and the grain policy. Some farmers also questioned cadres in the streets, at intersections, or in the wheat fields.

At this time, some Party members and cadres were also confused by the erroneous words and deeds, wavering, and some even lost their position. For example, in Fudian Township, seven Communist Party members handed in their Party membership cards, and forty-seven cadres said they "would not do socialism" anymore. Some Communist Party members and cooperative cadres were at a loss and did not know how to deal with these problems.

    The County Party Committee Mobilizes All Party Members and Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants
    To Participate in and Lead a Major Debate on Two Roads

In order to change this chaotic situation so that the summer harvest, summer planting, and unified purchase and sale of grain could proceed smoothly, in late June, the Yanshi County Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to mobilize all Communist Party members and members of the poor peasant and lower-middle peasant classes to participate in and lead a major debate on the grain issue. More than 10,000 cadres and activists throughout the county participated in the debate. Subsequently, more than 230 agricultural cooperatives throughout the county almost simultaneously launched this major debate on the two lines of socialist ideology and capitalist ideology.

    An Account of Grain Opens Everyone's Eyes
    Determined to Follow the Communist Party on the Road of Cooperativization

At a debate held in Fudian Township, 215 people attended. Everyone calculated the grain accounts of the 215 people present.

The situation in 1947 (before liberation) was:

    Twenty-five people were self-sufficient in grain (each person eating 280 jin per year); thirty-four people bought a little grain (sometimes one meal a day); one hundred and forty-eight people lacked grain (lacking for half a year); eight people barely had enough to eat (less than 280 jin).

The situation in 1957 (advanced cooperativization) was:

    Forty-five people were self-sufficient in grain (averaging 380 jin per year per person); twenty-five people lacked grain (lacking 10 to 15 days of fine grains); one hundred and forty-five people had surplus grain (including seventy-seven people who were still eating last year's old grain one month after the new wheat was harvested).

Of these 215 people, 101 were long-term or short-term laborers before liberation, 49 had fled famine in 1942 and only returned after liberation (including 12 who had relatives who starved to death outside), and 17 were forced to sell their children or land. The rest had not suffered major hardships.

This account opened the eyes of all the people who attended the debate. Everyone believed that without following the Communist Party and without relying on agricultural cooperativization, who knows what it would be like!

    Another Account Clarifies the Truth about Grain Issues
    Shattering the Fallacies Attacking the Grain Policy

Members of the Wujiawan Agricultural Cooperative carefully calculated accounts in the major debate on grain issues.

In order to compare with this year (before and after the Great Debate), only the summer harvest figures are listed for grain production (production and consumption figures do not include sweet potatoes). When calculating the average annual grain consumption per person, it is calculated based on the current fixed population of 3,200 people.

I. Grain production has increased (statistics for the whole cooperative):

    1948: 3,000 mu planted, 520,000 jin of grain harvested, 170 jin per mu, averaging 124 jin of summer grain per person after deducting miscellaneous expenses.
    1954: 3,000 mu planted (including double-cropped area, same below), 620,000 jin of grain harvested, 206 jin per mu, averaging 139 jin of summer grain per person after deducting miscellaneous expenses.
    1956: 2,800 mu planted, 830,000 jin of grain harvested, 295 jin per mu, averaging 203 jin of summer grain per person after deducting miscellaneous expenses.
    1957 (severe drought): 2,900 mu planted, 670,000 jin of grain harvested, 231 jin per mu, averaging 172 jin of summer grain per person after deducting miscellaneous expenses.

II. The area of cash crops has increased (statistics for the whole cooperative), and the area sown to grain has decreased by a total of 862 mu.

    1,750 mu of cotton were planted in 1955, and 2,124 mu of cotton were planted in 1957.

III. The population has increased: According to the extrapolation of typical surveys, the cooperative has increased by a total of 768 people in nine years, an annual increase of 85 people, requiring an annual increase of 32,000 jin of rations (380 jin per person per year).

IV. The number of people going out has increased: Currently, the cooperative has a total of 191 people working outside: 3 students, 15 workers, 13 teachers, 16 cadres, 11 soldiers, 36 commercial workers, 75 people engaged in sideline occupations outside (not eating at home), and 22 people who are away all year round. According to the supply standard (380 jin per person per year), the state must allocate more than 72,000 jin to supply these people each year. In addition, the state must allocate another 20,000 jin to supply the grain-deficient households in the cooperative, while the state only purchases 76,000 jin of grain from the cooperative each year.

V. Comparison of grain consumption between middle and poor peasants: Investigation of twenty-two poor peasant households: In 1948, the average annual grain consumption per person was 196 jin. Investigation of eight well-to-do middle peasant households: In 1948, the average annual grain consumption per person was 337 jin. Now, the average peasant here eats 307 jin of clean grain per year. A few well-to-do peasants consume 30 jin less grain than before liberation, and poor peasants consume 111 jin more. In addition, feed and seeds have also increased.

After carefully calculating the accounts, the members of the Wujiawan Agricultural Cooperative saw the following facts clearly: grain production increases year by year, the average amount of grain consumed per person increases, the majority of poor and lower-middle peasants consume much more grain, a few well-to-do middle peasants consume less grain, the area sown to grain is decreasing, the population is increasing rapidly, feed and seeds have increased, and the grain that the cooperative supports the state with is roughly enough for the consumption of people working outside, and the state still needs to supply more than 16,000 jin of grain each year.

At debates throughout the county, the ironclad facts listed by the farmers shattered the absurd words and deeds of those who took the lead in attacking the agricultural cooperatives and the state's unified purchase and sale policy for grain. Some of those who were confused also saw the correct path clearly.

### 偃师全县农业社就粮食问题开展了大辩论  有力批判了农村中的资本主义思想  摆事实算细账使广大农民看清了国家粮食政策的好处

    偃师全县农业社就粮食问题开展了大辩论
    有力批判了农村中的资本主义思想
    摆事实算细账使广大农民看清了国家粮食政策的好处
    据新华社郑州7日电　记者周原报道：正当夏收、夏分和夏种工作十分繁忙的时候，河南省偃师县的各个农业社里，展开了一场关于粮食问题的大辩论。这场辩论使每个农民都受到了一次深刻的社会主义教育。
    偃师县四十多万农民，去年5月在社会主义高潮中，参加了高级农业社。农民的生产积极性加上风调雨顺，夏季获得了前所未有的大丰收。全县平均每个社员在预分中分到了二百五十斤粮食，多者有达到五六百斤的。今年的冬小麦，因为一连六个月的干旱，每亩收获二百三十斤，比1956年的亩产二百七十一斤稍低。所以当麦子黄熟的时候，社员们知道今年收获量不及去年、分配数量要比去年夏季降低的情况，就议论纷纷。有些富裕中农趁机起来否定粮食统购统销制度。一部分对分配减少不满的农民由于入社不久，对农业社的生产、分配制度不习惯，也支持富裕中农的错误看法，非难国家的粮食政策。
    部分农民对夏收分配有意见
    富裕中农乘机攻击统购统销政策
    富裕中农首先到街头上说：“共产党啥都好，就是不让人吃饱。”他们故意把红薯面条端到街上说：“都来看看社会主义的饭。”寺里北农业社带头闹的十三个农民中，有十一个是富裕中农和中农。在夹村掀起责难国家粮食政策的二十四人中，有十五个是富裕中农和中农。这个时期，富裕中农充分运用他们在经济上对广大农民的影响，把农业社说的十分令人灰心。有些坏分子，也利用富裕中农的错误言行，加以传播、挑拨。他们竟指手画脚地攻击党、干部、农业社和粮食政策。有些农民也在街头、路口或麦场上责问干部。
    这时，有些党员和干部也被错误的言行迷惑住，摇摆不定，有的甚至丧失了立场。例如府店乡就有七个共产党员交出了党费证，四十七个干部表示“不干社会主义”了。部分共产党员和社干部束手无策，不知如何处理这些问题。
    县委动员全体党员和贫农下中农
    参加和领导展开两条道路大辩论
    为了改变这种混乱情况，以便夏收夏种和粮食统购统销工作能够顺利进行，6月下旬，中共偃师县委员会决定动员全体共产党员和贫农、下中农成分的社员来参加和领导粮食问题的大辩论。全县一万多个干部和积极分子参加了辩论的行列。接着，全县二百三十多个农业社就几乎同时全面展开了这场社会主义思想和资本主义思想两条路线的大辩论。
    一笔粮食账擦亮了大家的眼睛
    决心跟着共产党走合作化道路
    在府店乡召开的一次辩论会上，到了二百一十五人。大家算了到会的二百一十五人的粮食账。
    1947年（解放前）的情况是：
    粮食自给者二十五人（每人每年吃二百八十斤）；吃一点买一点的三十四人（有时一天一顿）；缺粮者（缺半年）一百四十八人；勉强够吃（不到二百八十斤）者八人。
    1957年（高级合作化）的情况是：
    粮食自足者四十五人（平均每人每年三百八十斤）；缺粮（缺十到十五天细粮）者二十五人；余粮者一百四十五人（其中有七十七人在新麦登场一月后仍吃去年陈麦）。
    在这二百一十五人中，解放前当长短工的有一百零一人，1942年外出逃荒到解放后才回家的四十九人（其中有十二人有亲属饿死在外），被迫卖儿女、卖地的十七人。其余没有受过重大苦难。
    这笔账擦亮了所有到会辩论的人的眼睛。大家都认为：不跟着共产党走，不依靠农业合作化，不知道该是什么样子啊！
    又一笔账澄清粮食问题真相
    粉碎了攻击粮食政策的谬论
    吴家湾农业社社员在粮食问题大辩论中，仔细进行了算账。
    为了和今年（大辩论前后）对比，粮食生产上只列举夏收数字（生产数字和吃粮数字都没有包括薯类）。在计算年度每人平均用粮时，按目前固定人口三千二百人计算。
    一、粮食增产了（全社统计）：
    1948年：种三千亩，收粮五十二万斤，亩产一百七十斤，除杂支外，平均每人吃夏粮一百二十四斤。
    1954年：种三千亩（包括复种面积，下同），收粮六十二万斤，亩产二百○六斤，除杂支外，平均每人吃夏粮一百三十九斤。
    1956年：种二千八百亩，收粮八十三万斤，亩产二百九十五斤，除杂支外，平均每人吃夏粮二百○三斤。
    1957年（大旱）：种二千九百亩，收粮六十七万斤，亩产二百三十一斤，除杂支外，平均每人吃夏粮一百七十二斤。
    二、经济作物面积增加了（全社统计），粮食播种面积共减少八百六十二亩。
    1955年种棉一千七百五十亩，1957年种棉二千一百二十四亩。
    三、人口增加了：据典型调查的推算，这个社九年共增加七百六十八人，每年增加八十五人，年需增加口粮（每人每年三百八十斤）三万二千斤。
    四、外出人口增多：这个社目前共外出：学生三人，工人十五人，教员十三人，干部十六人，军人十一人，商业工作者三十六人，在外搞副业（不在家吃饭）者七十五人，常年外出者二十二人，共一百九十一人。按供应标准（每人每年三百八十斤）计算，国家每年要调拨七万二千多斤供给这批人，另外国家又要调拨两万斤供给这个社的缺粮户，而每年国家向这个社征购的粮食只有七万六千斤。
    五、中贫农用粮相比较：二十二户贫农调查：1948年，常年平均每人用粮一百九十六斤。八户富裕中农调查：1948年，常年平均每人用粮三百三十七斤。现在，这里农民平均每年吃净粮三百零七斤。少数富裕农民比解放前用粮减少三十斤，贫苦农民增加了一百一十一斤。除此之外，饲料和种子也增加了。
    经过算细账，吴家湾农业社的社员看清了这样的事实：粮食年年增产，每人平均用粮量增加，多数贫农和下中农用粮增加很多，少数富裕中农用粮减少，粮食播种面积在减少，人口迅速增加，饲料、种子增加了，全社支援国家的粮食，大致够在外人员的食用，另外每年尚需国家供应一万六千多斤粮食。
    在全县各地的辩论会上，农民们所列举的铁一般的事实，粉碎了那些带头进攻农业社和粮食统购统销政策的人的荒谬言行。有些被迷惑的人也看清了正确的道路。
