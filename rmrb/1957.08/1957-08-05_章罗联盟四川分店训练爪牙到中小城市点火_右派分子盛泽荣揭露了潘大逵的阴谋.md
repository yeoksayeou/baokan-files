Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 4th. Recently, at the anti-Rightist struggle conference held in the cultural and educational circles of Leshan County, Sichuan Province, and the Leshan County branch of the China Democratic League, Sheng Zerong, deputy chairman of the Leshan County branch of the China Democratic League, vice chairman of the Leshan County Political Consultative Conference, and a Rightist, confessed to Pan Dakui's conspiracy to run a cadre training class to train a group of accomplices to incite trouble in various small and medium cities.

Sheng Zerong said that in August of last year, he was transferred to the Chengdu "China Democratic League In-service Cadre Training Class" for training for more than a month. At the same time, there were seven key members of the China Democratic League from Zigong, Nanchong, Neijiang, Ya'an, Suining, and Santai who were trained with him. The purpose of this training was for Pan Dakui to cultivate a group of grassroots key members in an organized and planned manner, to accept a set of anti-communist programs proposed by Pan Dakui, so as to go back to the grassroots to incite trouble. During the training period, Pan Dakui repeatedly emphasized to everyone that in the future, the China Democratic League and the Communist Party should be on an equal footing, and the China Democratic League should dare to "find" the "shortcomings" in the policies and guidelines of the Communist Party, so as to establish the prestige of the China Democratic League and give play to the role of the members of the League.

Sheng Zerong said that during their training, the Rightist Fei Xiaotong once conveyed to them the program of the Zhang-Luo Alliance to incite intellectuals to attack the Party, and had sent them to colleges and universities to specifically collect materials for attacking the Party. Fei Xiaotong also asked them to train and improve themselves in the attack on the Party, and to find a set of experiences. Fei Xiaotong instructed the Rightist Bu Wenqin to lead this group of key members who were being trained to convene a symposium at the Sichuan Medical College to incite a group of professors to attack the Party. Then Pan Dakui, Zhao Yiming and others organized this group of key members to go to the district branches of the Chengdu China Democratic League to learn and exchange experiences in igniting trouble.

Sheng Zerong said that at the end of the training class, Pan Dakui assigned them tasks, telling them that after returning to the grassroots organizations, they should first conduct in-depth investigations and studies among intellectuals, do a good job of ranking, and develop the organization through extensive airing of views, paying attention to cultivating and developing the potential of backward elements. At that time, Pan Dakui said that whether they were people who had been struggled against in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, or historical counter-revolutionaries, they could be regarded as development targets. Pan Dakui also encouraged these people to go back to air their views extensively without any worries, and that the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League would support them.

Sheng Zerong said that after he returned to Leshan after completing the training, he specifically convened 22 forums in Leshan's middle schools, gathering members of the China Democratic League and non-members who had withdrawn from the Party, objects of suppression of counter-revolutionaries struggles, backward elements, and those who had been punished and came from landlord, warlord, and bourgeois families who had always been dissatisfied with the Party, and launched a frantic attack on the Party.

    训练爪牙到中小城市点火
    右派分子盛泽荣揭露了潘大逵的阴谋
    新华社成都4日电　最近，在四川省乐山县文教界和民盟乐山县支部举行的反右派斗争大会上，民盟乐山县支部副主任委员、乐山县政协副主席、右派分子盛泽荣交代了潘大逵举办干部训练班，训练一批爪牙到各中小城市去四处点火的阴谋。
    盛泽荣说，去年8月间，他被调到成都“民盟在职干部训练班”受训了一个多月，和他同时受训的有自贡、南充、内江、雅安、遂宁、三台的民盟骨干分子一共七人。这次训练的目的，是潘大逵有组织有计划地培养一批基层骨干分子，接受潘大逵提出的一套反共纲领，以便回到基层去点火。在受训期间，潘大逵一再向大家强调今后民盟和共产党要平起平坐，民盟要敢于“找”共产党的政策方针上的“缺点”，这样才能树立民盟的威信，发挥盟员的作用。
    盛泽荣说，在他们受训期间，右派分子费孝通曾经向他们传达了章罗联盟煽动知识分子向党进攻的纲领，并曾经派他们到大专学校去专门搜集向党进攻的材料。费孝通还要他们在向党进攻中锻炼提高自己，摸索出一套经验。费孝通曾指示右派分子卜文钦率领这批正在受训的骨干分子到四川医学院召集座谈会，煽动一批教授向党进攻。接着潘大逵、赵一明等又组织这批骨干分子到成都民盟各区分部去学习和交流点火的经验。
    盛泽荣说，在训练班结束时，潘大逵向他们布置任务，叫他们回到基层组织后要首先在知识分子中进行深入的调查研究，作好排队工作，并要通过大鸣大放发展组织，注意培养和发挥落后分子的潜力。当时潘大逵说，无论是曾在肃反运动中被斗过的人，还是历史上的反革命分子，都可以作为发展对象。潘大逵还鼓励这批人回去要大鸣大放，不要有顾虑，有民盟四川省委给大家撑腰。
    盛泽荣说，他受完训回到乐山后，就在乐山各中学专门召集了民盟内外的脱党分子、肃反斗争对象、落后分子以及受过处分和出身于地主、军阀、资产阶级一贯对党不满的分子，先后举行了二十二次座谈会，向党发起了猖狂的进攻。
