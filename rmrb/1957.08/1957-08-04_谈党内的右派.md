    On Rightists Within the Party
  　Xu Bangyi
    There are rightists within the Communist Party. This is a fact that we must face squarely. Some well-meaning comrades are still somewhat skeptical about this fact. They always think: Since they are Communist Party members, how can they be rightists? It should be said that this view is justifiable. A Communist Party member should certainly not be a rightist. However, there is indeed a small number of people in our party who are rightists in the true sense of the word. If we ignore the fact that rightists exist within the party, we will commit an unforgivable political error. Some rightists within the party are nominally "Communist Party members," but in reality, they are agents of rightists in society within the party, and echoes of rightists in society within the party. Although they are small in number within the party, they are extremely harmful and are a hidden danger to the party's cause. Did you not see that during this large-scale attack on the party by rightists in society, some rightists within the party closely cooperated and took the opportunity to attack? Some "colluded" or "resonated" with rightists in society; some echoed each other, working from both inside and outside; some were "vanguards," some were "rear guards"; some were "combat staff officers," and some "cheered." In the sharp class struggle, they became traitors to the party.
    Since rightists within the party and rightists outside the party are both collectively referred to as "rightists," it can be said that they have commonalities. The commonality between them, simply put, is anti-Party, anti-socialist, and opposition to the six political criteria put forward by Comrade Mao Zedong. However, one is anti-Party from within the party, and the other is anti-Party from outside the party. "Inside" and "outside" can collude with each other and support each other. Some rightists within the party attempt to use the support of rightists outside the party to achieve their personal anti-Party goals; while rightists outside the party try their best to find rightists within the party as internal support. Therefore, for our party, both rightists inside and outside the party are extremely dangerous. Their common target of attack is the Party.
    Rightists within the party, because of their identity as "Communist Party members," are more likely to deceive and confuse people; they have one more "advantage" than rightists outside the party, that is, they know more about some of the party's secrets (during this attack on the party by rightists in society, some rightists within the party provided confidential materials); in addition, some rightists within the party have higher positions within the party, and their destructiveness to the party will be even greater.
    Can we take rightists within the party lightly? Absolutely not. In this political storm, since rightists within the party have shown such ruthlessness to the party, then we should also strip them of their beautiful clothes in front of the masses so that people can recognize their ugly true faces. In this regard, we should treat them "equally" with rightists outside the party, and there should be no "sentimentalism."
    According to dialectics, bad things can be turned into good things. Having rightists within the party is a bad thing, which we oppose. But after the anti-Party activities of rightists within the party are exposed, it can enable us to learn lessons, educate every party member, and remove incorrigible rightists from the party, making the party more pure and more consolidated. In this way, bad things will also be transformed into good things.
    Just like any other thing, the formation of rightists within the party into rightists also has its development process. The development process of a considerable number of rightists within the party is often from serious individualism in ideology to further development into political rightists (as for bad elements who were originally mixed into the party, that is another matter). They are often dissatisfied within the party because their personal desires (status, rank, treatment, enjoyment, power, etc.) are not satisfied; or they suffer some "grievances" within the party, so they harbor resentment, are dissatisfied everywhere; so they are estranged and double-minded; so they negate everything, only find shortcomings, and do not look at achievements; only look at the dark side, not the bright side; so they have ulterior motives, pull and pull, collude and collude, and use any means to achieve their goals; so they degenerate into rightists, and what communism, what serving the people, "I will not dream of the Duke of Zhou again."

    谈党内的右派
  　许邦仪
    共产党内有右派。这是我们必须加以正视的事实。有一些好心肠的同志对于这个事实还有点儿将信将疑。他们总是认为：既然是共产党员，怎么会是右派呢？应该说，这种看法本是无可非议的。一个共产党员当然不应当是一个右派。可是，我们党内确实又有一小部分人是名副其实的右派人物。如果我们忽视党内右派分子存在这个事实，我们就将会犯不可宽恕的政治错误。党内的一些右派分子在名义上虽是“共产党员”，而实际上他们是社会上右派分子在党内的代理人，是社会上右派分子在党内的应声虫。他们在党内人数虽少，危害极大，乃是党的事业的心腹之患。君不见，在这次社会上右派分子向党大举进攻中，党内的一些右派分子竟然密切配合，乘机出击。他们有的与社会上右派分子“同谋”或“共鸣”；有的互相呼应，里应外合；有的是“急先锋”，有的是“后卫队”；有的是“作战参谋”，有的“呐喊助威”。在尖锐的阶级斗争中，他们成了党的叛徒。
    党内右派分子与党外右派分子，既然都统称“右派”，也就可以说明他们是有共同性了。他们之间的共同性，简单地说来，就是反党、反社会主义和反对毛泽东同志提出的六条政治标准。不过，一个是在党内反，一个是在党外反。“内”和“外”，可以互相勾通，也可以互相支援。有的党内右派分子就企图借党外右派分子的支援来达到个人反党的目的；而党外右派分子就尽力寻找党内右派分子作为内应。因此，对于我们党来说，党内外的右派分子都是具有极大的危险性。他们共同的攻击目标就是党。
    党内的右派分子由于有着“共产党员”的身份，更容易欺骗人和迷惑人；他们比党外右派分子更多一个“本钱”，就是多知道党内的一些机密（这次社会上右派分子对党进攻，就有一些党内右派分子提供机密材料）；此外，有些党内右派分子在党内又是有较高职位的，他们对党的破坏性就会更大。
    难道我们对于党内右派分子能够等闲视之么？切切不可。在这次政治大风浪中，党内的右派分子既然表现得对党那样无情，那末，我们也就应该在群众面前剥去他们漂亮的外衣，使人们认清他们丑恶的真面目。在这一点上，理应同党外右派分子“一视同仁”，来不得“温情主义”。
    按照辩证法，坏事可以变成好事。党内有右派是坏事，是我们所反对的。但是党内的右派反党活动暴露以后，又可以使我们接受教训，教育每个党员，并把不可救药的右派分子从党内清除出去，使党更加纯洁，更加巩固。这样，坏事也就会转变成为好事了。
    正如同任何事物一样，党内右派分子之形成为右派，也有他们的发展过程。有相当数目的党内右派分子发展过程的路线，往往就是从思想上严重的个人主义进一步发展成为政治上的右派（至于原先就是混进党内的坏分子，又当别论）。他们在党内往往由于个人的欲望（地位、级别、待遇、享受、权力等等），得不到满足；或者在党内受到一些“委屈”，于是就怀恨在心，到处不满；于是就离心离德，三心二意；于是就否定一切，尽找缺点，不看成绩；只看阴暗面，不看光明面；于是就别有企图，拉拉扯扯、勾勾搭搭，欲达目的，不择手段；于是就堕落成为右派人物，于是什么共产主义，什么为人民服务，就“吾不复梦见周公”矣。
