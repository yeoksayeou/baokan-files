In China's rural areas, millions upon millions of farmers are engaged in a great debate on the grain question: debating whether the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain is correct, whether its implementation is good, and how farmers should treat unified purchase and sale. Through this debate, we can further raise the socialist consciousness of farmers, criticize capitalist ideas in rural areas, and educate farmers to more consciously implement the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain and support the country's economic construction.

The grain problem was never solved in old China. The feudal dynasties of the past, right up to the Kuomintang reactionary government, were unwilling and unable to solve this problem. After liberation, in order to fundamentally solve the grain problem, the Party and the government, on the one hand, developed the agricultural cooperative movement, leading farmers onto the socialist road, using collective strength to develop production and increase the production of grain and various cash crops; on the other hand, they implemented the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, and before grain production could fully meet the needs of all aspects, they implemented the socialist method of planned distribution to ensure the supply of various essential needs.

The unified purchase and sale of grain has been implemented for four years since 1953. It ensures that China's 600 million urban and rural people have food to eat under the condition of continuous development of production, and eat less chaff and vegetables and more grain year by year. It has met the urgent need for grain during socialist construction, and our grain front has been basically stable in recent years. It helped us overcome the major disasters of 1954 and 1956, and grain prices have remained stable and have not risen. Without the policy of unified purchase and sale, if grain merchants were allowed to stir up trouble in the market, how could these "miracles" have occurred? The broad masses of farmers have benefited greatly from the unified purchase and sale of grain, and therefore support this policy.

However, this does not mean that people's views on the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain are all correct, and that there are no misunderstandings, dissatisfaction, or even resistance to the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain. Therefore, it is still necessary to launch this debate.

Some people say: "The policy of unified purchase and sale of grain is good, but it would be even better if we could keep more grain." There are quite a few people who have this idea, and they all advocate that the state should purchase less grain and sell more. The first thing that should be debated is: is this view correct? Is the state purchasing too much and selling too little, and should it purchase less and sell more?

Developing production and improving living standards are the common aspiration of everyone. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, Chinese farmers have been engaged in revolution for decades, and have been working hard to build socialism after liberation, all for this purpose. In recent years, the living standards of Chinese farmers have improved significantly. In 1949, the average amount of grain possessed by each person in rural areas was only about 400 jin. At that time, land reform had not yet been implemented in most areas, and the amount of grain possessed by poor and middle peasants was much lower than this number. By 1952-1953, the average amount of grain possessed by each person had increased to more than 520 jin, and in 1956-1957, it had increased to more than 590 jin, which is about half more than at the time of liberation. Although this average number is still low compared with other economically developed countries, it is unprecedented in Chinese history. For the vast majority of poor and lower-middle peasants who make up the majority of China's rural population, 590 jin is an unimaginable figure in the past. After deducting seeds and feed, the rations are determined according to the different production levels in each region, some are more than 300 jin, some are more than 400 jin, and some are more than 500 jin, all of which are much more than before liberation. Everyone can look at their neighbors to the east and west, how many families have changed thin porridge to dry rice, how many families have changed wild vegetables to grain, how many families no longer borrow money or "ask for help", and live a life with food and clothing based on their own income! What is life like today, has it gone up or down, the vast majority of farmers are very clear in their hearts.

Can the standard of grain retention in rural areas be further increased? With the tremendous development of agricultural production, the standard of grain retention will certainly continue to increase in the future, but this is not possible now. For the distribution of grain, there must be a global perspective, taking into account the needs of all parties. 1956 was the year in which China produced the most grain, with an average of about 610 jin per person. Rations, feed, seeds, industrial grain, exported grain... all come from these 610 jin, and none of them should be missed. If the rations of farmers continue to increase, the rations of urban and industrial and mining residents, the grain for industrial construction, the rations of farmers in cash crop areas, and the rations of grain-deficient farmers and farmers in disaster areas cannot be guaranteed. In this way, not to mention anything else, industry will not be able to develop in the first place, and the task of national industrialization cannot be realized. One of the main reasons why our grain production cannot be increased significantly is precisely because there is no large-scale socialist industry, so there is not enough water conservancy construction, and the output of chemical fertilizers is too small, and so on. To develop agriculture, we must develop industry. Without the support of a strong industry for agriculture, if the total grain output cannot be increased significantly, how can the standard of rations be raised when the population continues to increase?

Southern China produces more grain than northern China, can the standard of rations there be raised a bit? It's also not possible. Many areas in the south of the Yangtze River are high-yielding grain areas, with long agricultural labor hours throughout the year, and farmers generally eat more grain than in the north by custom. The state has already taken these situations into account when determining the standard of grain retention. North China is a cotton-producing area, and a part of the grain in the south must be used to help North China and support North China's production of cotton. Otherwise, some cotton fields in North China will inevitably be converted into grain fields, and everyone's clothing problem will become tense. If the grain in the bumper harvest areas is surplus, can the standard of grain retention there be raised a bit more? This should also not be done. Bumper harvest areas must use a part of the grain to help the disaster areas, otherwise, who will support the compatriots in the disaster areas? If the bumper harvest areas this year suffer disasters next year, who will support you then?

If some people, on the one hand, express their support for the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, and on the other hand, demand an unlimited increase in grain consumption, this is untenable. Chinese farmers originally had the good habit of being hardworking, simple, and thrifty. In the difficult days before liberation, people could still calculate carefully, live within their means, and try to arrange their lives as well as possible. Now that the rations of most people are about half more than in the past, isn't it easier to arrange life? As for saying that "the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain is a bit inconvenient," that is an one-sided view that only cares about oneself and not about everyone. Some surplus grain households feel that it is "inconvenient" to not be able to keep all the grain at home for free disposal. If some grain-deficient households did not have the policy of unified purchase and sale, they would have no grain to eat, wouldn't that be even more inconvenient? It can be seen that convenience cannot be seen from the form. In the old society, unified purchase and sale was not implemented, and farmers seemed to be able to freely dispose of their grain. In fact, for the majority of farmers, after receiving the grain, they first paid land rent, and then sold grain at low prices to repay high-interest loans; in the season when the new crop was not yet harvested, they either bought grain at high prices or borrowed new debts, where was there any convenience! At that time, landlords, merchants, and usurers could arbitrarily oppress and exploit farmers, they were very free and convenient. Now farmers live a life without oppression and exploitation, most people retain enough rations, some grain-deficient households are supplied by the state, and a few disaster-stricken households are relieved by the state. Farmers live a carefree and increasingly better life, when have they ever been so free and convenient?

In order to protect this great convenience and great freedom, they should consciously accept some temporary small restrictions and small inconveniences. Farmers with surplus grain should appropriately restrain consumption and sell grain to the state in accordance with regulations. This is the farmers' unshirkable responsibility to support national construction, and it is also the most effective way for farmers to help each other through famine. After agricultural cooperation, the state and farmers have greatly increased their ability to prevent and resist disasters, but they still cannot stop and eliminate natural disasters. From 1953 to 1956, an average of 150 million mu of arable land was affected by disasters every year, which shows that China's agricultural production is not stable enough. Any region has the possibility of suffering disasters, and farmers in any region need the assistance of the state. Therefore, no matter which region or cooperative's farmers, in the year and season of bumper harvest, they should sell as much grain as possible to the state to help the state support the farmers affected by disasters. Farmers who are not short of grain should consciously not buy grain. Grain-deficient households should restrain consumption and buy grain according to the prescribed quantity and time. The state's grain is all purchased from farmers, and if you want the state to supply more grain, that is, you want the state to purchase more grain from other farmers. If everyone makes this request, what will the state do? How can the patriotic farmers of New China do such a thing that harms others and benefits themselves, and harms the public and benefits themselves!

Of course, some people will be unhappy if we do this. Landlords and rich peasants are dissatisfied with the unified purchase and sale because their lives are not as good as before, and some of the more well-to-do middle peasants also have less grain.

The fallacies and activities of landlords and rich peasants who sabotage the unified purchase and sale should be exposed and cracked down on at any time. As long as they have the opportunity, they are unwilling to relax this evil activity. Zhang Jiyao, a landlord in Longshan Township, Jiangpu County, Jiangsu Province, recently provoked farmers by saying: "Before liberation, you only paid me 50 dan of rent; now you sell surplus grain and pay public grain, and the government takes away more than 100 dan. What is the benefit of unified purchase and sale!" 100 dan is indeed more than 50 dan. However, was there only one Zhang Jiyao in Longshan Township in the past? Did the farmers in the whole township only pay 50 dan of rent every year? What did the landlord do with the rent he collected? What does the government do with the public grain it collects and the surplus grain it buys? The farmers know this truth best, and there is no need to say more. The landlord's sabotage of the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain and his provocation of the relationship between the government and the farmers is precisely for the 50 dan of rent, in order to once again trample the farmers under his feet. In response to the landlord's conspiracy, we must carry out a resolute struggle with them and completely defeat their criminal activities.

Those well-to-do middle peasants who are dissatisfied with the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain should be given ideological education; those few who resist the unified purchase and sale of grain must be given appropriate reasoning struggles. Why were the lives of well-to-do middle peasants good in the past? That is because they had more and better land, draught animals, and farm tools, often hired some workers, and also lent out some high-interest loans. They could not use up the money and grain they received, and some people went to the market to engage in speculative business. They themselves thought that their lives were indeed not bad, and they were very convenient. However, their ability to hire people was because someone had to sell their labor; their ability to lend money was because someone had to borrow money; their ability to engage in speculative business was because someone had to endure the exploitation of selling cheap and buying expensive. Their good life also caused a lot of pain to the poor farmers, is this what should be the case? Some well-to-do middle peasants have opinions on cooperation and are dissatisfied with the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, which shows that they are still nostalgic for the past life and want to retreat from socialism to capitalism. Can poor peasants, lower-middle peasants, and patriotic well-to-do middle peasants allow them to do this? Moreover, in the old society, the economic situation of well-to-do middle peasants was also unstable. A few people who succeeded in speculation might become rich peasants or landlords. Most people who failed in speculation, coupled with the attacks of natural and man-made disasters, would go bankrupt and become poor peasants. Even for the sake of well-to-do middle peasants, implementing the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, supporting the country's economic construction, and creating increasingly stable and increasingly happy living conditions for all farmers (including well-to-do middle peasants, of course) is only beneficial and not harmful!

The debate on the grain issue has been conducted several times since liberation. Each debate has yielded great gains and raised the socialist consciousness of farmers. Who is patriotic and who is not patriotic; who sincerely wants to take the socialist road and who still wants to retreat to capitalism, these questions must be clarified in the debate, especially in the practical actions of selling surplus grain and buying unified sales grain. We believe that through this debate, the vast majority of farmers will further distinguish the major issues of right and wrong in the grain issue, sell more and buy less, practice strict economy, and prove their love for the country and socialism with practical actions.

### 分清粮食问题的大是大非

    分清粮食问题的大是大非
    在我国农村中，千千万万农民正在展开关于粮食问题的大辩论：辩论粮食统购统销政策对不对，执行情况好不好，农民应该怎样对待统购统销。通过这个辩论，可以进一步提高农民的社会主义觉悟，批判农村中的资本主义思想，教育农民更加自觉地执行统购统销政策，支援国家的经济建设事业。
    粮食问题在旧中国是从来没有解决的问题。历代的封建朝廷一直到国民党反动政府，都不愿意、也不可能解决这个问题。解放以后，党和政府为了从根本上解决粮食问题，一方面，发展农业合作运动，把农民引上社会主义道路，用集体力量发展生产，增产粮食和各种经济作物；另一方面，实行粮食统购统销政策，在粮食产量还不能充分满足各方面的需要以前，实行社会主义的计划分配办法，保证供应各种必不可少的需要。
    从1953年开始，粮食统购统销已经实行了四年。它保证我国六万万城乡人口在生产不断发展的条件下都有饭吃，而且一年比一年少吃糠菜多吃粮食。它满足了社会主义建设期间对于粮食的迫切需要，我们的粮食战线几年来基本上是稳定的。它帮助我们战胜了1954年和1956年的大灾荒，粮价一直稳定未涨。如果没有统购统销政策，如果听任粮食商人在市场上兴风作浪，哪能出现这些“奇迹”？广大农民身受统购统销的许多好处，因而是拥护这个政策的。
    可是，这并不等于说人们对统购统销政策的看法都是正确的，对统购统销政策已经没有任何误解、不满、甚至抵抗。所以还有必要展开这次辩论。
    有人说：“统购统销政策是好的，如果能够再多留些粮食就更好了。”有这种思想的人相当多，他们都主张国家对粮食少购多销。首先应该辩论：这种看法对不对？国家是不是购得太多，销得太少，是不是应该购得更少，销得更多？
    发展生产，改善生活，人同此心，心同此理。我国农民在共产党领导下革命几十年，解放以后努力建设社会主义，都是为了这个目的。近几年来，我国农民的生活水平已经提高了许多。1949年农村每人平均占有的粮食只有四百斤左右，当时多数地区还没有实行土地改革，贫农、中农占有的粮食比这个数目还要低得多。到1952—1953年度，每人平均占有的粮食增加到五百二十多斤，1956—1957年更增加到五百九十多斤，比刚解放的时候多了一半左右。这个平均数跟其他经济发达的国家比起来虽然还是低的，但是在我国历史上却是空前未有的，对于占我国农村人口绝大多数的贫农和下中农来说，五百九十多斤更是过去无从想像的大数字。除去种籽和饲料，按照每个地区不同的生产水平规定的口粮，有的三百多斤，有的四百多斤，有的五百多斤，都比解放以前多许多。大家可以看看自己的东邻西舍，多少家把稀饭换成了干饭，多少家把野菜换成了粮食，多少家不再借贷、“告帮”，靠着自己的收入过着有吃有穿的日子！今天的生活怎么样，上升了还是下降了，绝大多数农民心里是很清楚的。
    能不能把农村的留粮标准更提高些？随着农业生产的巨大发展，留粮标准将来一定要继续提高，但是现在还没有这种可能。对于粮食的分配，必须要有全局观点，把各方面的需要都照顾到。1956年是我国生产粮食最多的一年，每人平均约有六百一十斤。口粮、饲料、种籽、工业用粮、出口粮食……都出在这六百一十斤里，哪一项都不应该漏掉。农民的口粮如果继续增加，城市和工矿区居民的口粮、工业建设用粮、经济作物区农民的口粮以及缺粮农民和灾区农民的口粮就不能保证。这样，别的不说，首先工业就发展不起来，国家工业化的任务就不能实现。我们的粮食生产不能大量增加，主要原因之一正是没有社会主义的大工业，因而水利建设还不够多，化学肥料产量太少，等等。要发展农业必须发展工业。如果没有强大的工业支持农业，如果粮食总产量不能大量增加，在人口不断增加的情况下，怎能提高口粮标准呢？
    南方出产粮食比北方多，那里的口粮标准能不能提高些？也不可能。江南许多地区是粮食高产区，全年农业劳动时间长，一般农民吃粮在习惯上就比北方多，这些情况国家在确定留粮标准的时候已经照顾到了。华北是产棉区，南方的粮食必须有一部分接济华北，支持华北生产棉花。否则华北一部分棉田势必改成粮田，大家的穿衣问题就要紧张起来。丰收地区的粮食有富余，那里的留粮标准能不能再提高些呢？这也不应该。丰收区必须用一部分粮食接济歉收区，不然，谁来支援歉收区的同胞呢？今年的丰收区明年遭了灾荒，又靠谁来支援你们呢？
   如果有的人一方面表示拥护粮食统购统销政策，一方面又要求无限制地提高粮食消费量，这是说不通的。我国农民原有艰苦朴素、勤俭持家的好习惯。在解放前的困难日子里，人们尚且可以精打细算，量入为出，尽可能把日子安排得好过些。现在多数人的口粮比过去大约多了一半，日子岂不是更加容易安排了么？至于说“粮食统购统销政策有些不方便”，那更是一种片面的、只顾自己不顾大家的看法。有些余粮户觉得不能把全部粮食留在家里自由支配，是“不方便”。有些缺粮户如果没有统购统销政策，就没有粮食吃，岂不是更不方便吗？可见方便不方便，不能从形式上看。在旧社会里，没有实行过统购统销，农民好像可以随意支配自己的粮食。其实，对多数农民来说，收下粮食先缴地租，接着贱价卖粮还高利贷；在青黄不接的季节，或者高价买粮，或者举借新债，哪里有什么方便！那时候，地主、商人、高利贷者可以任意欺压和剥削农民，他们倒是很自由、很方便的。现在农民过着没有压迫、没有剥削的生活，多数人留有够用的口粮，一部分缺粮户有国家供应，少数受灾户有国家救济。农民过着无忧无虑、越来越好的生活，什么时候这样自由、方便过？
    为了保护这种大方便、大自由，应该自觉地接受某些暂时性的小拘束和小不方便。有余粮的农民应该适当地节制消费，按照规定把粮食卖给国家。这是农民支援国家建设的义不容辞的责任，也是农民互助渡荒最有效的办法。在农业合作化以后，国家和农民防灾、抗灾的力量大大增加，可是还不能制止和消灭自然灾害。从1953年到1956年，每年平均有一亿五千万亩耕地成灾，可见我国的农业生产还不够稳定。任何地区都有遭灾的可能，任何地区的农民都需要国家的援助。因此，无论哪个地区、哪个合作社的农民，在丰收的年度和季度，都应该尽可能多卖粮食给国家，帮助国家支援受灾的农民。不缺粮的农民应该自觉地不要买粮食。缺粮户更应该节制消费，按照规定的数量和时间买粮食。国家的粮食都是向农民征购来的，你要国家多供应粮食，也就是要国家多向别的农民征购粮食。如果大家都提出这种要求，国家怎么办呢？新中国的爱国农民哪能作这种损人利己、损公利私的事！
    我们这样做，当然会有一些人不高兴。地主、富农因为生活不如从前了，一部分富裕中农占有的粮食也少了些，所以对统购统销不满。
    对地主、富农破坏统购统销的谬论和活动，要随时加以揭露和打击。他们只要有机会，是不肯放松这种罪恶活动的。江苏江浦县龙山乡有个地主名叫张继尧，前些日子挑拨农民说：“解放以前你们只给我交五十担租；现在你们卖余粮、交公粮，被政府弄去一百多担。统购统销有什么好处！”一百担确实多于五十担。可是，龙山乡过去只有一个张继尧吗？全乡的农民每年只交五十担租吗？地主收了地租干什么？政府收了公粮、买了余粮干什么？这道理农民最清楚，是用不着多说的。地主破坏统购统销政策，挑拨政府和农民的关系，正是为了那五十担租，为了重新把农民踩到脚下。针对地主的阴谋，要和他们进行坚决的斗争，彻底把他们的犯罪活动打下去。
    对一部分富裕中农对统购统销政策不满意的，应该进行思想教育；对其中抗拒粮食统购统销的少数人，必须进行适当的说理斗争。过去富裕中农的生活为什么好？那是因为他们有较多较好的土地、耕畜和农具，经常雇些忙工，兼放部分高利贷，收的钱粮用不完，有些人就到市场上作投机生意。他们自己看起来，生活的确很不坏，手头是很方便的。可是，他们所以能够雇人，是因为有人必须卖工；他们所以能够放债，是因为有人必须借债；他们所以能作投机生意，是因为有人必须忍受贱卖贵买的剥削。他们的好生活同样给贫困的农民造成许多痛苦，这难道是应该的么？一部分富裕中农对合作化有意见，不满意统购统销政策，这表示他们还在留恋过去的生活，想从社会主义后退到资本主义。贫农、下中农和爱国的富裕中农能够允许他们这样作么？而且，在旧社会里，富裕中农的经济状况也是不稳定的。少数人投机成功，可能变成富农或地主。多数人投机失败，加上天灾人祸的袭击，就会破产变成贫农。就是为富裕中农打算，执行粮食统购统销政策，支持国家的经济建设，给全体农民（当然包括富裕中农在内）创造越来越稳定、越来越美满的生活条件，也是只有好处没有坏处的！
    关于粮食问题的辩论，在解放以后，已经进行过好几次。每次辩论都有很大的收获，都提高了农民的社会主义觉悟。谁是爱国的，谁不是爱国的；谁真心要走社会主义道路，谁还想倒退到资本主义，这些问题在辩论中，特别是在卖余粮、买统销粮的实际行动中，不能不弄清楚。我们相信，经过这次辩论，绝大多数农民将会进一步分清粮食问题上的大是大非，多卖少买，厉行节约，用实际行动证明自己爱国家、爱社会主义。
