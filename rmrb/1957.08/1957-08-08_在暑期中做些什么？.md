    The activities of the broad masses of students during this year's summer vacation are richer in content and have many characteristics compared to previous years. That is, in addition to paying attention to organizing diverse and colorful cultural and sports activities, various regions are also planning to organize students to participate in agricultural production, public welfare labor, and household labor, as well as to organize students to conduct political study on the struggle against the Rightists. Shanghai will have more than 30,000 middle school students going to the countryside in batches during the summer vacation to participate in voluntary labor. In Guangzhou, more than 2,000 junior and senior high school students went to the countryside on July 10th and 11th to help farmers with the summer harvest. The Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education and the Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League require middle school students to organize political study on the struggle against the Rightists during the summer vacation. These are the central issues in the current ideological and political education work in primary and secondary schools, and also major events in the current domestic political life. Through these activities and studies, students' ideological and political awareness can be further improved.
    In the past, primary and secondary education tended to neglect politics and be detached from production. Labor education often only involved teaching general principles in the classroom, with little participation in actual labor. The purpose of our country's general education is to cultivate students into national construction talents who are loyal to the cause of socialism, diligent and simple, and combine physical and mental labor. However, this point has not been fully understood by teachers, students, and students' parents. And the true meaning of combining education with production can only be deeply appreciated through production practice. The summer vacation is a good time for students to participate in production practice. At this time, schools can appropriately organize students of all grades to go to the countryside to participate in physical labor within their capabilities, or engage in other public welfare labor, household labor, and visit factories and rural areas, so that they can understand the hardships of the working people, cultivate their labor habits, increase their production knowledge, and combine the school's labor education with production practice. This is very beneficial for overcoming the shortcomings of school education being detached from reality. In the future, primary and secondary schools should make as much use of the holidays as possible to organize students to participate in production labor, so that they can be educated in the practice of production labor.
    Participating in industrial and agricultural production and service industry labor during the holidays can not only allow students to get exercise, but also obtain a portion of income to be used as learning or family living expenses. With the help of the Labor Section of the Chongwen District People's Committee, Beijing No. 49 Middle School has more than 60 middle school students with difficult family lives working as temporary workers, each earning a certain amount of remuneration each day. In this way, their expenses for buying books and stationery for the next semester can be solved by themselves. This method of work-study has both educational and economic significance, and is beneficial to both individuals and the country, and should be promoted.
    The struggle against the Rightists is a profound political and ideological socialist revolution movement, a complex and acute class struggle, and a major event in our country's domestic political life. Many university students have devoted themselves to this struggle and received profound class education. Ordinary middle schools should also use the real materials of this class struggle to educate students and improve their socialist awareness. This struggle actually has an impact on middle school students. Some middle school students lack the ability to identify the anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks of the Rightists, and therefore have many vague ideas; a very small number of students, under the instigation or support of Rightists in society and within the school, slander our country's national system, policies, and the Party and League organizations in schools; it is particularly noteworthy that some anti-socialist elements in some universities have sent provocative letters, leaflets, etc. to students in some secondary schools, attempting to take advantage of some middle school graduates' abnormal psychology regarding enrollment and employment to create chaos. Therefore, during the summer vacation, a certain amount of time should be set aside to explain to middle school students the great significance of the struggle against the Rightists for safeguarding the socialist construction cause, for consolidating the Party's leadership, and for consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, organize students to study relevant documents carefully, clarify some of the students' vague ideas, and improve students' socialist awareness. At the same time, in conjunction with the political study of the anti-Rightist struggle, education should also be carried out among primary and secondary school students on correctly dealing with the issues of enrollment and employment, properly arrange students who cannot be admitted to higher schools, and educate them not to listen to rumors and not to be fooled by bad elements.
    Of course, the summer vacation is a time for students to rest. In addition to these activities, various regions should conduct various interesting activities under leadership, such as holding summer camps, children's parks, travel, camping, recreational evenings, story-telling sessions, and various cultural and sports activities, so that young people and children can have sufficient rest, improve their health, and have plenty of energy to meet the learning tasks of the next semester.

### 在暑期中做些什么？

    在暑期中做些什么？
    广大学生今年暑期的活动同往年比较，内容更为丰富，也有许多特点。这就是各地除了注意组织多样多采的文化体育活动以外，还有计划地组织学生参加农业生产和公益劳动、家务劳动，组织学生进行关于反右派斗争的政治学习。上海将有三万多中学生在暑期中分批下乡参加义务劳动。广州市在上月10、11两天内有两千多名初、高中学生下乡帮助农民夏收。江西省教育厅和共青团省委要求中学生在暑期里，组织关于反右派斗争的政治学习。这些，是当前中小学思想政治教育工作中的中心问题，也是当前国内政治生活中的大事。通过这些活动和学习，可以进一步提高学生的思想政治觉悟。
    过去，中小学教育有忽视政治和脱离生产的偏向，劳动教育往往只是在课堂上讲授一般的道理，很少参加实际劳动。我国普通教育的目的，是要把学生培养成忠于社会主义事业的、勤劳朴素的、体力劳动和脑力劳动相结合的国家建设人才。可是，这一点并没有完全为教师、学生和学生家长所了解。而要能真正了解教育结合生产的意义，也只有从生产实践中才能得到深刻的体会。暑期就是使学生参加生产实践的很好的时机。学校在这个时候可以适当地组织各年级学生到农村去参加力所能及的体力劳动，或者从事其他公益劳动、家务劳动，参观工厂、农村，使他们了解劳动人民的甘苦，培养他们劳动的习惯，增加生产知识，使学校的劳动教育和生产实践结合起来。这对于克服学校教育脱离实际的缺点有很大好处。今后中小学应当尽可能利用假期组织学生参加生产劳动，使他们在生产劳动的实践中受到教育。
    利用假期参加工、农业生产和服务性行业的劳动，不但可以使学生得到锻炼，而且还可以得到一部分收入，作为学习或家庭生活费用。北京第四十九中学在崇文区人民委员会劳动科的帮助下，有六十多名家庭生活困难的中学生当了临时工，每人每天能得一定的报酬。这样，他们下学期买书和买文具的费用就可以自己解决。这种勤工俭学的办法，既有教育意义，又有经济意义，对于个人和国家都有好处，也是应该提倡的。
    反右派斗争是一场深刻的政治上、思想上的社会主义革命运动，是一场复杂尖锐的阶级斗争，是我国国内政治生活中的一件大事。许多高等学校的学生都投入了这一斗争，受到深刻的阶级教育。普通中学也应当利用这一阶级斗争的现实材料，向学生进行教育，提高学生的社会主义觉悟。这个斗争实际上对中学生不是没有影响的。一部分中学生对于右派分子反党反社会主义的言论，缺乏识别能力，因而存在许多模糊思想；极少数的学生在社会上以及学校内部右派分子的煽惑或支持下，对于我国国家制度、政策以及学校的党团组织进行污蔑；特别值得注意的是某些高等学校的反社会主义分子曾经将带有煽惑性的书信、传单等寄发给一些中等学校的学生，企图利用部分中学毕业生对于升学和就业的一些不正常的心理，制造混乱。因此，在暑假期间，应该抽出一定时间向中学生讲清楚反右派的斗争对于保卫社会主义建设事业，对于巩固党的领导、巩固人民民主专政的重大意义，组织学生好好学习有关的文件，澄清学生的一些模糊思想，提高学生的社会主义觉悟。同时，结合反右派斗争的政治学习，还应该向中小学生进行关于正确地对待升学和就业问题的教育，妥善地安排不能升学的学生，教育他们不要听信流言蜚语，不要上坏分子的当。
    当然，暑假是学生休息的时期，除了这些活动以外，各地应当有领导地开展各种有趣味的活动，如举办夏令营、儿童乐园、旅行、露营、文娱晚会、故事会等各种文化体育活动，使青年和少年儿童有充分的休息，增进健康，能够有充沛的精力迎接下学期的学习任务。
