　　Luo Longji Publicly Spreads Rumors with Vicious Intent!
Editor:
    On March 18th of this year, Luo Longji fabricated a sensational story in his speech at the Third Plenary Session of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC, saying: After liberation, "there were British students pulling rickshaws, and American students setting up cigarette stalls."

    I am quite familiar with this situation. There was no such thing among the returned students after liberation. To clarify the truth, we inquired with the National Committee of the CPPCC and relevant units. It turns out that the "British student pulling a rickshaw" that Luo Longji mentioned refers to a former Kuomintang reactionary army officer who had done many evil deeds; the "American student setting up a cigarette stall" refers to a person who knew a little English and had worked as a translator in a movie theater before liberation. These people have nothing to do with students who studied abroad. The reason why Luo Longji reversed black and white and openly spread rumors was to shoot a cold arrow at the Party under the guise of this issue.

    Since liberation, the Party and the People's Government have always been extremely concerned about the situation of students studying in capitalist countries, warmly welcoming and assisting them to return to China to participate in construction and reunite with their families. Those who had difficulties with travel expenses were all subsidized. After returning to China, they were warmly received. The work was determined after consultation with the individuals, according to the needs of national construction, combined with their own wishes and expertise. In the past eight years, all the returned students have been properly placed in jobs. After they went to their work posts, they were fully trusted, and many have become the backbone of various units. For example, at Peking University, 35 returned students hold positions of associate professor or above, and among the research fellows and above at the Institute of Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, there are 20 returned students after liberation. From the above situation, it can be seen that the Party and the government attach great importance to returned students, and the achievements made in this work are enormous. Luo Longji openly spread rumors, painting reality as a complete darkness, and this conspiracy has now completely failed.

### 罗隆基公开造谣用心狠毒！

　　罗隆基公开造谣用心狠毒！编辑同志：
    今年3月18日，罗隆基在政协第二届全国委员会第三次全体会议的发言中捏造了一个耸人听闻的事情，他说：解放后“有英国留学生拉板车，美国留学生摆烟摊。”
    对于这方面的情况，我是比较了解的。解放以后回国的留学生中根本没有这样的事情。为了弄明白事情的真相，我们又向全国政协及有关单位查询。原来罗隆基所说的“英国留学生拉板车”，是指的一个过去在国民党反动派军队里作恶多年的旧军官；“美国留学生摆烟摊”，是指一个稍懂英语、解放前曾在一家电影院里作过翻译的人。这些人根本沾不上留学生的边儿。罗隆基之所以如此颠倒黑白，公开造谣，是借题向党放出一支冷箭。
    解放以后，党和人民政府，一直对在资本主义国家的留学生的处境极其关怀，热烈欢迎并协助他们回国参加建设，使他们和亲人团聚。他们回国旅费有困难的，全部予以补助。回国后，他们都受到了热情的接待。工作是按照国家建设需要、结合本人的志愿和专长，在和本人商量好以后才确定的。八年来回国的留学生，全部妥善地安置了工作。他们到工作岗位上以后，受到了充分的信任，许多人已成为各单位的骨干力量。例如在北京大学，就有三十五名归国的留学生任职在副教授以上，中国科学院物理研究所副研究员以上人员中，解放以后回国的留学生就有二十人。从以上的情况可以看出，党和政府对归国留学生是十分重视的，这方面工作所获得的成绩是巨大的。罗隆基公开造谣，把现实说成一团漆黑，这种阴谋诡计现在是全部破产了。
