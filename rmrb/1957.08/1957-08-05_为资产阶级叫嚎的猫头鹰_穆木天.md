The Owl Howling for the Bourgeoisie—Mu Mutian

(Reported by our reporter Sun Zunian) The Chinese Department of Beijing Normal University has held four meetings of teachers, students, and staff in recent days to criticize the anti-communist and anti-socialist fallacies of the rightist Mu Mutian.

Denouncing Beijing Normal University as a "Dark Kingdom"

During the rectification campaign, Mu Mutian conspired with his wife, Peng Hui, to stir up trouble everywhere, inciting the masses to engage in "great democracy," and viciously slandering the Party, attempting to destroy the Party Committee to achieve his personal ambitions. On May 22, Guangming Daily published his "My Appeal" in a prominent position. In this article, he distorted facts and insulted the Party, trying to deny all the achievements made by Beijing Normal University under the leadership of the Party in recent years, and described Beijing Normal University as a "dark kingdom." Some students of the Chinese Department's advanced studies class and research class, after collective discussion, criticized "My Appeal." They said that Mu Mutian disregarded the facts and maliciously described the support for brother universities as teachers being "exiled" and downgraded as "conspiratorial retaliation" and "unwarranted disasters." He described the serious handling of the errors of a certain Party member comrade in the past as "the Party Committee and administration not handling it," in order to confirm the Party Committee and administration's "sectarianism" in protecting the errors of Party members; he slandered the leaders' necessary explanations of matters as "daring to quibble." Mu Mutian's purpose of distorting and insulting was to negate everything, to negate the work achievements of Beijing Normal University, so he said that Beijing Normal University was a "dark kingdom," and that Beijing Normal University's "consistent tradition" was "those who hear do not take heed, those who speak are guilty, punishment does not reach the high officials, and rituals do not extend to the common people," and even wanted to rename Beijing Normal University as "Iron Lion Tomb Normal University." Obviously, Mu Mutian was wearing black glasses and shouting that everything was pitch black.

Plagiarizing Others' Manuscripts

Mu Mutian believed that he should be rated as a first-level professor. What are the facts? The joint speech of six comrades in the Foreign Literature Group, represented by Chen Dun, revealed that Mu Mutian plagiarized other people's manuscripts, wearing the mask of a scholar. They pointed out: "The salary assessment is the responsibility of the salary assessment committee to lead and make decisions. We think that Mu Mutian's rating as a second-level professor is not low. Take Mu Mutian's foreign literature lecture notes, which he believes are 'the highest level in the country,' they are mainly edited, and translated from the preface of a foreign language book and some papers. According to what is known now, the Greek mythology in the lecture notes comes from the Soviet Encyclopedia, 'Ancient Greece' Section 5, Greek epic poems come from the preface to 'Homer's Poems,' the Renaissance also comes from the Soviet Encyclopedia and other papers, The Tale of Igor's Campaign comes from the upper volume of 'Russian Literary History,' 'The Knight in the Panther's Skin' is the preface to the Russian version of 'The Knight in the Panther's Skin,' and Byron comes from the second volume of 'English Literary History.' From the perspective of morality, Mu Mutian did not attend classes because he was rated as second-level, and did not care about teaching assistants and graduate students, delaying the studies of more than 100 people. Is this Mu Mutian's sense of responsibility to teaching and socialist construction?" Zheng Yilan and Li Wenlin also pointed out in their joint speech that he not only took other people's things in his lecture notes and pretended they were his own, but also wrote his own name when translating other people's articles. The "Shakespeare and His Plays" published in the inaugural issue of Wenyi Xuexi in 1954 was Morozov's article published in the May 1954 issue of Translation. As a professor, this attitude towards doing scholarship is very immoral.

Only Fearing That the World Is Not in Chaos

During the rectification campaign, in order to strengthen the momentum of the rightists' attack on the Party, Mu Mutian also tried his best to slander the Party among the masses. He said: "Anti-Party is not necessarily counter-revolutionary. Gao and Rao were anti-Party, but they were not counter-revolutionary. Their anti-Party is not necessarily anti-socialist. It is not individual that bureaucracy is found in the countryside, but a nest, because the head is bad, and when developing Party members, they also look for those who are like-minded, so once a problem is discovered, it is a nest. Beijing Normal University also has this kind of patriarchal style. There are factions within the Party. Now the Hubei faction is in power. The leaders of Beijing Normal University are not learned but skilled. The so-called 'skilled' is to be skilled in rectifying people." He also said that Party members should not only have Party spirit but not people's spirit, and that joining the Party would mean breaking away from the people. Mu Mutian used this method of slandering the Party to incite students to engage in "great democracy" to oppose the leadership of the Party. Fourth-year students of the Chinese Department revealed that Mu Mutian's remarks were to guide the students to oppose the Party. He also encouraged students to write satirical poems and provided materials, saying that after "letting a hundred flowers bloom," Beijing Normal University did not bloom any flowers, but only released a peach blossom. He also said that there is no democracy in Beijing Normal University now, and instructed students to engage in "great democracy" to reverse the situation. However, in the anti-rightist struggle, the awakened college students did not blindly follow the rightists, but bravely launched a struggle against the rightist Mu Mutian.

Twenty years ago, Mu Mutian became a traitor to the revolution and turned to the direction of the bourgeoisie. Therefore, Lu Xun called him a "turning" writer at that time. The "turning" writer openly said at a symposium last April and May: "Now the Communist Party members are obstacles to progress." Some students satirically said that indeed, Mu Mutian's "Marxism-Leninism" level is superb, so superb that it negates the existence of the Communist Party. It seems that he had already entered communist society far ahead in his mind, and therefore resolutely deviated from the Party twenty years ago. One classmate commented that Mu Mutian's howling, like all rightists, is like a dying old owl, singing the sound of death fiercely and deeply from the "bottom of the Iron Lion Tomb."

Opened the floodgates for the Rightists to attack the Party

Mu Mutian's anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks were spread through the Guangming Daily, the mouthpiece of the Zhang-Luo alliance, controlled by Chu Anping. This was praised by the rightists at the time as a brave general who fired the first shot at the "three evils" in helping the Party rectify its work. The rightist Tao Dayong admired Mu Mutian's anti-Party remarks very much, saying that the article "My Appeal" was good and had political significance, and that he was a hero who dared to act. Why did Tao Dayong like these anti-Party remarks? Comrade Ren Qingchuan revealed the mystery. He said, "Let Mu Mutian make the Beijing Normal University Party Committee stink and collapse, so that I, Tao Dayong, can immediately take over with the signboard of 'democratic school management,' and you, Mu Mutian, will also have an official position." Many people also revealed that Mu Mutian and Tao Dayong had contact during the rectification campaign. The fact that Mu Mutian and his wife Peng Hui were on the list drawn up by Tao Dayong for the two "democratic school management" symposiums proves this point.

As a Communist Party member, Peng Hui had a bad work style in peacetime. Many people reflected that she was no longer like a Communist Party member. In the anti-rightist struggle, she not only did not stand firm on the Party's position, but fell into the quagmire of the rightists and joined her husband Mu Mutian in launching a frenzied attack on the Party, leaking Party secrets, publishing anti-Party remarks, and viciously attacking the Beijing Normal University Party Committee, becoming the rightists' internal accomplice within the Party. The broad masses of teachers, students, and staff expressed great anger at such Party members, gave powerful exposure and rebuttal to her anti-Party words and deeds, and demanded that the Party organization deal with her seriously.

    为资产阶级叫嚎的猫头鹰—穆木天
    本报记者孙祖年报道：北京师范大学中文系连日来举行四次师生、职员大会，批驳右派分子穆木天反共、反社会主义谬论。
    污蔑师大为“黑暗王国”
    在整风期间，穆木天同他的妻子彭慧共谋兴风作浪，到处煽动群众搞“大民主”，对党进行恶毒的诬蔑，企图搞垮党委，达到个人野心的目的。5月22日光明日报以显著的地位刊载他的“我的呼吁”。在这篇文章里，他歪曲事实和辱骂党，力图否认师大几年来在党的领导下所取得的一切成就，把师大说成是“黑暗王国”。中文系进修班和研究班部分同学，经过集体讨论，对“我的呼吁”一文进行批驳。他们说，穆木天不顾事实，恶毒地把对兄弟院校的支援说成是教师“被发配”、降级之类的“阴谋报复”和“无枉之灾”。他把以往严肃处理的某党员同志的错误，说成是“党委和行政不处理”，以证实党委和行政“宗派主义”地袒护党员的错误；把领导同志对事情的必要说明，诬蔑为“敢予巧辩”。穆木天歪曲和辱骂的目的，就是要否定一切，否定师大的工作成绩，所以他说师大是“黑暗王国”，说师大的“一贯传统”是“闻者不戒，言者有罪，刑不上大夫，礼不下庶人”，甚至把北京师大改名为“铁狮子坟师大”。显然，穆木天是戴着黑色的眼睛，在那里大叫一团漆黑。
    剽窃他人文稿
    穆木天认为应评他为一级教授。事实怎样呢？以陈惇为代表的外国文学组六个同志的联合发言揭发了穆木天剽窃他人文稿，戴着学者的假面具。他们指出：“评薪是评薪委员会负责领导作出决定的。穆木天被评为二级教授，我们认为是不低的。就拿穆木天自认‘全国水平最高’的他的外国文学讲稿说，主要是编辑的，是从外文版的一书序言和一些论文中间翻译过来的。根据现在所知道的，讲义中希腊的神话是来自苏联大百科全书，‘古希腊’第五节，希腊史诗来自‘荷马诗篇’序，文艺复兴也是来自苏联大百科全书及其他论文，伊戈尔王子远征记来自‘俄国文学史’上卷，‘虎皮骑士’是俄文版‘虎皮骑士’序，拜伦是来自‘英国文学史’第二卷。从德方面看，穆木天因评了二级，就不上课，对助教与研究生不管，耽误了一百多人的学业，这是穆木天对教学、对社会主义建设的责任感”？郑以岚、李文林联合发言中也指出，他不仅在讲稿上拿别人的东西，冒充自己的，而且翻译别人文章也写自己的名字。1954年创刊号文艺学习所发表“莎士比亚和他的戏剧”，就是1954年5月号译文发表莫罗佐夫的文章。作为一个教授，这种做学问的态度是很不道德的。
    唯恐天下不乱
    穆木天在整风期间，为了壮大右派分子向党进攻的声势，也极力在群众中污蔑党，他说：“反党不一定是反革命，高、饶是反党的，但是他们不是反革命，他们反党不一定是反社会主义的。在农村中发现有官僚主义不是个别的，而是一窝，因为头儿坏了，发展党员时也找气味相投的，所以一发现问题就是一窝。师大也是这种家天下的作风，党内有宗派，现在是湖北派当权。师大领导是不学有术，所谓‘有术’就是有整人之术”。他还说党员不要只有党性，没有人民性，入了党就脱离了人民。穆木天就是用这样污蔑党的办法来煽动学生搞“大民主”，来反对党的领导。中文系四年级学生揭露说，穆木天的这些言论就是要引导学生们去反党。他还鼓动学生写讽刺诗并提供题材，说什么“百花齐放”以后师大什么花也没有开，只放出一枝桃花。他还说，师大现在没有民主，指使学生搞“大民主”来扭转局面。但是，在反右派斗争中，觉悟了的大学生，没有盲目地跟着右派分子走，而勇敢地向右派分子穆木天展开了斗争。
    二十年前，穆木天就成为革命的叛徒，转到资产阶级的方向去。所以鲁迅在那时就称他为“转向”文人。“转向”文人在去年4、5月间的一次座谈会上又公然说：“现在共产党员是阻碍进步的东西了”。有的学生讽刺地说，的确，穆木天的“马列主义”水平高超，高到否定共产党存在的地步。似乎他早已在思想上远远地进入了共产主义社会，因而二十年前就决然背离了党。有一位同学评穆木天的叫嚎和一切右派分子一样，像一头垂死的老猫头鹰，从“铁狮子坟的底层”狞恶地低沉地歌唱着死亡的声音。
    为右派分子打开了反党的言路
    穆木天的反党、反社会主义言论，借助于章罗联盟的喉舌——储安平所控制的光明日报散播出去。这在当时被右派分子誉为帮助党整风中向“三害”放了第一炮的猛将。右派分子陶大镛很欣赏穆木天的反党言论，说“我的呼吁”一文好，有政治意义，并认为他是敢作敢为的英雄。陶大镛为什么喜欢这些反党言论呢？任清川同志点破了这个谜。他说：“让穆木天把师大党委搞臭，搞垮，这样我陶大镛马上可以以‘民主办校’的招牌去接收”，也有你穆木天一官半职。许多人还揭发在整风中，穆木天和陶大镛有来往。两次“民主办校”的座谈会，陶大镛拟的名单中，有穆木天和他的夫人彭慧就证明了这一点。
    彭慧作为一个共产党员，平时作风恶劣，不少人反映她早已不像个共产党员了。在反右派斗争中，她不但没有站稳党的立场，却堕入右派的泥坑中和她的丈夫穆木天在一起，夫唱妇随地向党发动猖狂的进攻，她泄露党的机密，发表反党言论，恶毒的攻击师大党委，成为右派分子在党内的内应。广大师生、职工，对这样的党员表示极大的愤怒，对她的反党言行给予有力的揭露和驳斥，并要求党组织加以严肃的处理。
