    Shenyang Anti-Rightist Struggle Deepens in Shenyang Universities; A Number of Anti-Party Cliques Exposed

    (Reported by this newspaper) The anti-Rightist struggle in Shenyang's universities has achieved a major victory. Although the majority of teachers and students in the city's ten colleges and universities have already begun their summer vacation, the leadership, activists, and administrative staff in each school are still tirelessly and intensely engaged in the anti-Rightist struggle. During the summer vacation, each school will also study and improve their work in accordance with the spirit of "rectification while correcting."

    At Northeast Institute of Technology, two Rightist anti-Party groups were exposed in the anti-Rightist struggle. One group was centered on Rightists Chen Shangjiong, Yue Congfeng, and Wang Yusheng, all members of the China Democratic League branch, and also included Wang Mingxun, a Rightist within the Party, head of the Mechanical Engineering Department, member of the Party General Branch, and alternate member of the Shenyang Municipal Committee. This was a group that, under the direct leadership of Rightists in the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, implemented the anti-Party program of Zhang and Luo. They incited teachers to "petition" and make trouble against the college Party committee and the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the CCP, demanding the establishment of a "Special Committee" above the Party. The other anti-Party group was headed by Xu Yetong, a professor in the Department of Technology and a member of the Jiusan Society. Xu Yetong conspired to seize the Party's leadership over the rectification in the Departments of Metallurgy, Non-Ferrous Metals, and Technology, coordinating with Rightists such as Chen Shangjiong in the Department of Mechanical Engineering to "open a second battlefield" in order to achieve "professor rule" and drive the Party out of the school.

    Shenyang Russian Language School exposed an anti-communist conspiracy group headed by teacher Chen Yunfu. This group was organized, had a division of labor, a program, and strategies. After the Hungarian Incident, they believed that "socialist countries are facing a crisis" and that a "time of chaos" was coming, so they often held secret talks together. When the Party began the rectification campaign, they believed that "the time of chaos has arrived" and made a plan: first, to overthrow the school's Party organization and usurp the school's leadership, occupying the position of the Russian Language School; the second step was to incite trouble when the time was right, making trouble all the way to Beijing, to achieve the restoration of capitalism.

    Teachers and students at Shenyang Normal College exposed the political conspiracies of Zhang Baisheng, deputy director of the Communist Youth League Propaganda Department, and Huang Zhenlü, editor of the college journal, both Rightists. They sought out people who were dissatisfied with the Party (such as those who were targets of the anti-Party purge), trying to win them over, attempting to organize a "new political party," and publish newspapers to counter the Party, and inciting students to make trouble. Teachers and students in the History Department also exposed the anti-Party activities of lecturer Xu Gongzhen and professor Zhou Chuanru. They maliciously spread rumors and slanders, supported students in making trouble, and attempted to overthrow the Party's leadership in the college.

    In the anti-Rightist struggle at Shenyang Agricultural College, Li Mingzhe, a member of the Jiusan Society, was criticized. He used the opportunity of the rectification and airing of views to slander socialist democracy, saying that there was more freedom now than during the puppet Manchukuo era. He said that now "the world is full of yes-men." He wanted everyone to be "outspoken gentlemen" against socialism.

    Teachers and students at Shenyang Pharmaceutical College focused on exposing and criticizing the reactionary activities of Rightists such as lecturer Yin Lu and Hu Xiangmin in inciting students to strike and petition.

    All teachers, students, and staff at Northeast University of Finance and Economics gave a stern rebuff to Professor Zhao Hongzhu's attempt to reverse the verdict. This counter-revolutionary element, stained with blood debts, used the opportunity of the Party's rectification to viciously slander the anti-Party purge, vigorously shouting "injustice" and demanding "appeals" for counter-revolutionary elements. His conspiracy has been crushed. Teachers and students at the University of Finance and Economics also exposed, criticized, or denounced Rightists Li Jingguo, Lü Enlai, and others.

    沈阳各高等学校反右派斗争深入
    一批反党小集团被揭发出来
    本报讯　沈阳市高等学校反右派斗争已取得重大胜利。目前全市十所大专学校的师生虽大部已经放了暑假，但各校反右派的领导力量、积极分子和行政人员仍然在不懈地紧张进行反右派斗争。暑假中，各校还要根据边整边改的精神研究改进工作。
    东北工学院在反右派斗争中揭露出两个右派反党集团。一个是以右派分子、民盟支部委员陈尚炯、岳从风和王裕生为核心，还有党内右派分子机械系主任、党总支委员、沈阳市委候补委员王铭勋等参加。这是一个在民盟沈阳市委右派分子直接领导下，执行章、罗反党纲领的集团。他们煽动教师向市委“请愿”、闹事，攻击学院党委和中共沈阳市委。要求成立凌驾党之上的
  “非常委员会”。另一个反党集团是以九三学社成员、工艺系教授许冶同为首。许冶同密谋夺取冶金、有色、工艺三系党对整风的领导权，配合机械系右派分子陈尚炯等“开辟第二战场”，以便实现“教授摄政”，把党从学校中赶出去。
    沈阳俄文专科学校揭发出以教师陈允福为首的反共阴谋集团。这个集团有组织、有分工、有纲领、有策略。在匈牙利事件发生后，他们就认为“社会主义国家已面临危机”，“乱世”就要到来，便常在一起密谈。当党开始整风之后，他们认为“乱世已到”，便作出计划：首先整垮学校党组织，篡夺学校领导权，占领俄专阵地；第二步是时机到来就煽动闹事，闹到北京，使资本主义复辟。
    沈阳师范学院的师生揭露共青团宣传部副部长张百生和院刊编辑黄振旅这两个右派分子的政治阴谋，他们物色对党不满的人（如肃反对象），进行拉拢，企图组织“新政党”，办报纸和党唱对台戏，并且煽动学生闹事。历史系的师生还揭露了讲师徐公振和教授周传儒的反党活动，他们恶意地造谣中伤，支持学生闹事，企图推翻学院的党的领导。
    沈阳农学院在反右派斗争中批判了九三学社社员李明哲。他利用整风鸣放机会，大肆污蔑社会主义民主，说现在还不如伪满时代有自由。说现在“天下尽是诺诺之士”。他要人人都作反对社会主义的“谔谔之士”。
    沈阳药学院教师学生，集中揭露、批判了讲师尹鲁、胡向旻等右派分子煽动学生罢课、请愿的反动活动。
    东北财经学院全体师生员工，对教授赵鸿翥的翻把阴谋给予了严厉回击。这个血债累累的反革命分子，利用党整风之机，对肃反运动进行了恶毒的污蔑，替反革命分子大肆喊“冤”和要“申诉”。他的阴谋已被粉碎。财经学院师生还揭发批判或声讨了右派分子李靖国、吕恩莱等。
