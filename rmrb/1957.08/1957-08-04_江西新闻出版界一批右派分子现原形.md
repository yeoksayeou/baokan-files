Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 3rd: A group of right-wing elements in Jiangxi's provincial-level news and publishing circles have been exposed.

The common characteristic of these right-wing elements is their rampant opposition to the Communist Party's leadership over the news and publishing事业. For example, right-wing element Qi Zhixin (editor of the cultural and educational group of Jiangxi Daily) even demanded to examine the articles and reports written by responsible comrades of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China published in Jiangxi Daily over the past year, and insulted these important articles and reports as "like big landlords," "monopolizing" the newspaper space. He also fabricated facts, saying that because the provincial party committee "interfered too much" with the newspaper, it hindered the independent thinking and creative expression of the editorial staff, and also clamored to "expand editorial power," saying that "if the editor-in-chief disagrees, the editors also have the right to publish the manuscripts in the newspaper." Cao Dichen, deputy leader of the rural group of Jiangxi People's Broadcasting Station, and Jin Yi and other editors of the propaganda group, also actively醞醸to筹办a "journal of colleagues" that does not require the leadership of the Communist Party and does not allow Communist Party members to participate. Cao also directly proposed to abolish the Communist Party's leadership over the People's Broadcasting Station. He believes that without the leadership of the Communist Party, the work of the People's Broadcasting Station would not be worse than it is now. Right-wing elements Zhang Li and Sun Deqing of Jiangxi People's Publishing House also openly wanted to abolish the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, saying that in another ten years, people working in the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China would become bureaucrats. Sun Deqing also advocated implementing a "chief editor system" to achieve the goal of abolishing the Communist Party's leadership over publishing事业.

### 江西新闻出版界一批右派分子现原形

    江西新闻出版界
    一批右派分子现原形
    据新华社南昌3日电　江西省级新闻出版界揭露一批右派分子。
    这些右派分子的共同特点是猖狂地反对共产党对新闻出版事业的领导。如右派分子戚志信（江西日报文教组编辑），竟要求检查一年来在江西日报上刊登的中共江西省委负责同志写的文章和报告，辱骂这些重要的文章和报告“像大地主”，“霸卡”了报纸篇幅。他还捏造事实，说由于省委对报纸“干涉过多”，因而妨碍了编辑人员的独立思考和创造性的发挥，还叫嚣要“扩大编辑权力”，“如果总编辑不同意，编辑也有权把稿件登在报纸上”。江西人民广播电台农村组副组长曹涤尘和宣传组的编辑金弋等人，还积极酝酿要筹办一张不要共产党领导、不许共产党员参加的“同人报纸”。曹还直接提出要取消共产党对人民广播电台的领导，他认为：没有共产党的领导，人民广播电台的工作不会比现在糟。江西人民出版社的右派分子张理、孙德卿还公然要取消中共江西省委，说什么再过十年，在中共江西省委工作的人都会变成官僚主义者。孙德卿也主张实行“主编制”，来达到取消共产党对出版事业的领导。
