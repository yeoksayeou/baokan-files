    The Mysteries of "Space Travel"
    Beijing Planetarium Hosts PLA Officers and Soldiers

    (Our newspaper reports) The newly built Beijing Planetarium's Sky Theater began receiving its first group of six thousand guests on the 2nd – officers and soldiers from the People's Liberation Army's organizations and troops stationed in Beijing, who came to view a performance of the artificial starry sky.

    On the 2nd, more than a thousand officers and soldiers experienced a one-hour "space travel" each, exploring the secrets of the starry sky. As the wall lights in the hall dimmed, silhouettes of Tiananmen, Jingshan, and the Soviet Exhibition Center on the surrounding walls lit up, and the night enveloped the earth. The delicate planetarium projector in the middle of the hall projected the beautiful starry sky onto the domed screen. Ventilators continuously supplied fresh air into the room, making it feel like a clear summer night, sitting in the courtyard admiring the starry sky. In the northwest direction appeared the Big Dipper, and not far from it in the due north direction was Polaris. The two bright stars on either side of the Milky Way, separated by longing, were Altair and Vega. The moon also gradually rose from the horizon. At this moment, a comet appearing in the west caught everyone's attention. It resembled an airplane flying into the high sky with a long tail. The speaker said, "Twenty-nine years later, in 1986, everyone will be able to see a comet in the sky over the Beijing area that is exactly the same as this one. Today, we invite you to admire it in advance."

    Many stars are relatively familiar to the People's Liberation Army. During the years of war, when crossing enemy blockades to raid the enemy's rear, marching rapidly at night to block the enemy, chasing after their own large units, or reconnoitering the enemy's situation, they often relied on them to identify directions. However, few people understood the countless stars, galaxies, and some unnoticed phenomena in the universe that are invisible to the naked eye. Here, everyone saw many nebulae like light gauze surrounding the Milky Way on the screen. The nearest large nebula to us, in the direction of Andromeda, is also 1.5 million light-years away. The one-hour night quickly passed, and dawn reappeared. The speaker said humorously, "Comrades, good morning!"

    To celebrate the 30th anniversary of the "August 1st" Army Day and to receive the most beloved people who came to visit, the construction workers of the Beijing Planetarium construction site and all the staff of the museum worked day and night, so that the Sky Theater project, which was originally scheduled to be completed in mid-August, was finally completed half a month ahead of schedule.

### “宇宙旅行”奥妙无穷  北京天文馆招待解放军官兵

    “宇宙旅行”奥妙无穷
    北京天文馆招待解放军官兵
    本报讯　新建的北京天文馆的天象厅2日开始接待第一批六千位客人——中国人民解放军在京机关、部队的官兵，来观看人造星空的表演。
    2日这天有一千多官兵在这里分别作为时一小时的“宇宙旅行”，去探索星空的秘密。当大厅的壁灯暗淡下去，四周墙壁上的天安门、景山和苏联展览馆等剪影亮起来，夜幕笼照了大地，大厅中间的那架精巧的天象仪，便在圆顶银幕上放映出了美丽的星空。通风器不断向室内输送新鲜的空气，这时候就好像是一个夏季晴朗的夜晚，坐在院子里欣赏着满天星斗。在西北方向出现了北斗七星，距这不远正北方向的是北极星，傍银河两岸望眼欲穿的两颗明星是牛郎星和织女星。月亮也渐渐从地平线上升起来，这时，西边出现的一颗彗星引起了大家的注意，它像一架飞入高空拖着一条长尾巴的飞机一样。讲员说：“二十九年以后，也就是1986年，大家可以在北京地区看到天空上出现同这完全一样的彗星，今天请大家提前来欣赏它。”
    许多星对于解放军来说是比较熟悉的，在战争的年代里，穿过敌人封锁线夜袭敌人后方，夜间急行军去阻击敌人、追赶自己的大部队或者侦察敌情，常常是靠着它们来识别方向。但是对于宇宙间那些肉眼看不到的许许多多恒星、银河系和一些不为人们注意的现象却很少有人了解。在这里，大家从银幕上看到很多像轻纱一般围绕着的银河星云，距我们最近的在仙女座方向的大星云，也有一百五十万光年远。一小时的夜晚很快就度过，大地又重现曙光，讲员饶有风趣地说：“同志们，祝你们早安！”
    为了庆祝“八一”建军三十周年，接待前来参观的最可爱的人，北京天文馆工地的建筑工人和这个馆的全体工作人员日夜赶工，使原计划8月中旬才能完工的天象厅工程，终于提前半个月完成了。（附图片）
