Rightist Elements in Beijing's Medical and Health Circles Exposed One After Another

(Our Newspaper News) The struggle to counterattack bourgeois rightist elements in Beijing's medical and health circles is being carried out in depth. Some rightist elements, hidden in medical education, medical scientific research, clinical medical treatment, and health administrative departments, are being exposed one after another.

Jin Baoshan, the director of the Department of Hygiene at Beijing Medical College, a rightist element who once served as the Director of the National Government's Health Department and styled himself a health "expert," distorted facts, exaggerated shortcomings, and obliterated achievements during the rectification movement, slandering the health cause after liberation as being in "complete chaos." He provoked the relationship between the Party and experts, opposed the Party's leadership in health work, saying, "The current bureau-level leaders in the Ministry of Health are very weak and cannot solve problems, far worse than the Kuomintang's 'Ministry of Health'." He also promoted his vicious idea of eliminating traditional Chinese medicine in an extremely concealed manner, saying, "Traditional Chinese medicine cannot be accepted as modern medical science," and "even if it has curative effects, it cannot be said to be scientific," and attempted to oppose the Party's leadership by opposing traditional Chinese medicine.

Long Bojian of the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, took advantage of various opportunities during the rectification period to distort the Party's policy of uniting Chinese and Western medicine, slander and negate traditional Chinese medicine, and oppose the Party's leadership in the research work of traditional Chinese medicine. He blamed the disunity between Chinese and Western medicine on the Party's policies, and slandered that the twelve-year scientific plan for the research of traditional Chinese medicine formulated by the Central Government had no scientific basis at all, and was "propagating superstition." Chen Susheng, an editor and compiler in the Editorial and Compilation Office of the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, a rightist element who faithfully implemented the organizational line of the Zhang Bojun rightist clique, not only unscrupulously developed the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party organization in the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and co-opted famous doctors of traditional Chinese medicine outside the Academy, but also spread anti-communist and anti-socialist remarks within the Academy.

Yang Enfu, the director of the Nutrition Department of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, slandered, "I really don't feel the warmth of socialism, I feel terrified myself." Zhou Qiyuan, the deputy director of the Nutrition Department, advocated that there should be no party activities in the Academy of Medical Sciences, and believed that only by abolishing party activities can factionalism be eliminated.

The commander of the Zhang Bojun rightist clique in the medical and health circles is Li Zong'en, the president of the Chinese Union Medical College. Xue Yu, the director of the Department of Pharmacy at Beijing Medical College, was also exposed for his anti-communist and anti-socialist remarks, as well as his conspiracy to usurp the Party's leadership in the pharmaceutical cause. In addition, some rightist elements have also been exposed successively in Beijing Medical College, Union Medical College, the Ministry of Health and its affiliated units.

    北京医药卫生界右派分子纷纷现形
    本报讯　北京医药卫生界的反击资产阶级右派分子的斗争正在深入开展。一些隐藏在医学教育、医学科学研究、临床医疗和卫生行政部门的右派分子，正陆续被揭露出来。
    北京医学院卫生系主任金宝善，这位曾任国民党卫生署长，自封为卫生“专家”的右派分子，在整风运动中，歪曲事实，夸大缺点，抹煞成绩，污蔑解放后卫生事业“一团糟”。他挑拨党同专家的关系，反对党对卫生工作的领导，说，“目前卫生部司、局长一级很弱，不解决问题，比国民党的‘卫生部’差得远”。他还极其隐蔽地宣传他的消灭中医的恶毒主张，说，“祖国医学不能作为现代医学科学来接受”，“有疗效也不能说是科学”，并企图借反对中医来反对党的领导。
    中医研究院龙伯坚，在整风期间利用各种机会，歪曲党的团结中西医政策，污蔑、否定中医，反对党领导中医研究工作。他把中西医的不团结说成是党的政策造成的，并且污蔑说，中央制定的中医研究十二年科学规划，根本没有科学性，是在宣传迷信”。中医研究院编审室编审员陈苏生，这个忠实执行章伯钧右派集团的组织路线的右派分子，除了在中医研究院不择手段地发展农工民主党组织，拉拢院外著名中医以外，在院内散布反共反社会主义言论。
    中国医学科学院营养系主任杨恩孚诬蔑说，“我真感受不到社会主义的温暖，我自己感到恐怖。”营养系副主任周启源主张在医学科学院里不应当有党派活动，认为只有取消党的活动才能消灭宗派主义。
    章伯钧右派集团在医药卫生界的大帅是中国协和医学院院长李宗恩。北京医学院药学系主任薛愚的反共反社会主义言行，以及他企图篡夺党在药学事业的领导权的阴谋也被人揭穿了。此外，在北京医学院、协和医学院、卫生部及其所属单位也陆续揭发了一些右派分子。
