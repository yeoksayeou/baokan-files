Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 9th: On the 7th, the escort artillery of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, guarding the Liuao Peninsula on the Fujian front, hit and damaged a Chiang Kai-shek gunboat.

　　At 6:15 AM on the 7th, two Chiang Kai-shek "Jiang"-class gunboats intruded into the sea area about 9,000 meters south of Liuao Peninsula, attempting to intercept our transport ships. Our escort artillery immediately opened fire and bombarded the enemy ships, hitting and damaging one of them. The other enemy ship led its injured companion and fled in a panic towards the open sea.

　　One of our transport junks was damaged by enemy artillery fire, but the remaining ships and personnel safely sailed into nearby ports.

    我击伤蒋军炮舰一艘
    新华社福建前线9日电　7日，守卫在福建前线六鳌半岛上的中国人民解放军护航炮兵击伤蒋军炮舰一艘。
    7日晨六时十五分，蒋军江字号炮舰二艘窜入六鳌半岛以南约九千公尺的海面上，企图拦劫我运输船。我护航炮兵立即开炮轰击敌舰，击伤其中一艘。另一艘敌舰领着它受伤的伙伴狼狈地向外海逃去。
    我运输机帆船一只被敌炮打伤，其余船只、人员安全驶进附近港口。
