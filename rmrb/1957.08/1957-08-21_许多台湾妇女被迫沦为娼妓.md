Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th: An increasing number of Taiwanese women are being forced into prostitution as they find themselves with no other way to make a living. According to Taiwanese newspapers, in Taipei alone, the number of publicly registered brothels with the "Police Department" has recently reached more than 350. Among them, the more than 100 brothels in Baodouli and Qingshanli contain over 1,000 prostitutes. The number of clandestine brothels is even greater than that of the publicly registered ones. In the Taiyuan Road area alone, there are 40 such establishments, housing over 300 unregistered prostitutes. In other major and minor towns across Taiwan, brothels have been springing up like bamboo shoots after a rain. In Miaoli Township, with a population of only 40,000, the number of brothels has recently grown to no less than 300, with each housing between two to eight women, totaling over 1,000. Taiwanese newspapers say: "In terms of population ratio, Miaoli Township may be the town with the most unregistered prostitutes in the world." In the taverns throughout Taiwan, there are tens of thousands of "tavern girls" who are similarly forced to sell their bodies and souls to make a living. Incidents of prostitutes and "tavern girls" committing suicide because they cannot bear the torment of this kind of life are heard of daily in Taiwan.

　  许多台湾妇女被迫沦为娼妓
    新华社广州16日电　愈来愈多的台湾妇女因生活走头无路被迫沦为娼妓。据台湾报纸报道，仅台北市经过向“警察局”登记的公开妓女户，最近已达到三百五十多户。其中宝斗里和青山里的一百多户，娼妓即在一千人以上。秘密娼寮比公开妓女户还多。仅散布在太原路一带的四十家，就有私娼三百多人。台湾其他的大城小镇，最近妓女户也像雨后春笋般出现。只有四万人口的苗栗镇，最近妓女户也发展到不下三百户，每户人数多的七八人，少的二三人，合计在千人以上。台湾报纸说：“依人口比例，苗栗镇说不定是世界上私娼最多的小镇”。台湾各地的酒家中，还有数以万计的“酒家女”，同样被迫出卖灵肉来维持生活。妓女和“酒家女”因受不了这种生活折磨而自杀的事件，在台湾日有所闻。
