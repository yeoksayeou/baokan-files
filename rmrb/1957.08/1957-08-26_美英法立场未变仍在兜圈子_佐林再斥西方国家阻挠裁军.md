Xinhua News Agency dispatches: The United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee continued its meeting on August 23rd. Representatives of Western countries made some "clarifications" at the meeting regarding the "new proposal" put forward by the US representative Stassen on August 21st. Soviet representative Zorin also made some summaries of the "clarifications" made by the representatives of Western countries.

　　US representative Stassen, in answering questions raised by Soviet representative Zorin, said that according to the "new proposal" of Western countries, an agreement in principle must first be reached on the issue of "cessation of production" of nuclear weapons before nuclear weapons testing can be stopped. Stassen did not explain what fundamental changes the Western countries' "new proposal" of August 21st had compared to previous proposals. British representative Ormsby-Gore said in his speech that Western countries resolutely rejected the proposal to immediately ban nuclear weapons testing before a broad disarmament convention is reached.

　　Soviet representative Zorin then pointed out that judging from the speeches of French representative Moch and US representative Stassen, they clearly believed that this proposal was an inseparable part of all the measures they had formulated as partial disarmament, and that it could not be resolved independently. This is now inevitably an obstacle to the immediate cessation of testing, because no agreement has been reached on the partial measures of disarmament, and no consensus has yet been reached on all issues in this partial agreement. Therefore, the new proposal of Western countries does not change the existing situation in this sense. Western countries, as in the past, insist that testing can only be stopped after a joint agreement on partial disarmament measures is signed. In this regard, their attitude has not changed at all.

　　As for the relationship between stopping this testing and stopping the production of fissionable materials, the Western proposal still insists that an agreement in principle must first be reached on the issue of stopping production. At the same time, Western countries have consistently opposed the prohibition of atomic weapons, opposed not using such weapons, and opposed the elimination of such weapons from national armaments. Therefore, the previous position of Western countries remains unchanged here today.

　　Zorin said that the Soviet Union has always maintained and continues to maintain this position: the prohibition of testing cannot be linked to other measures of partial disarmament. Otherwise, it will delay the resolution of this issue and entangle this simple issue in a large number of complex issues.

　　Zorin pointed out that regarding the issue of the duration of the cessation of testing, Stassen's statement that the current proposal is different from the past is incorrect. In the past, Western countries said that the duration was ten months, and then it would be decided within this period whether the duration should be extended; now it is proposed to extend the period of cessation of testing to twelve months, which is an extension of two months, and then it is necessary to decide within this period whether to extend the period again, and even say that it can be extended to two years. However, this transition still depends on whether the conditions of Western countries are accepted: stopping the production of fissionable materials without prohibiting atomic weapons and destroying such weapons existing in national armaments.

　　The Disarmament Subcommittee meeting will continue on August 27th.

### 美英法立场未变仍在兜圈子  佐林再斥西方国家阻挠裁军

　　美英法立场未变仍在兜圈子
　  佐林再斥西方国家阻挠裁军
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：联合国裁军小组委员会在8月23日继续举行会议。西方国家代表在会议上对于美国代表史塔生8月21日提出的西方国家“新建议”作了若干“说明”。苏联代表佐林对西方国家代表的“说明”也作了某些总结。
    美国代表史塔生在回答苏联代表佐林提出的问题时说：根据西方国家的“新建议”，必须先就核武器的“停止生产”问题达成原则上的协议，才能停止核武器的试验。史塔生没有说明西方国家8月21日的“新建议”比起以前的建议来有什么根本性质的改变。英国代表欧姆斯比—戈尔在发言中说：西方国家断然拒绝关于在达成广泛的裁军公约之前立即禁止核武器试验的建议。
    苏联代表佐林接着指出，从法国代表莫克和美国代表史塔生的发言看来，他们显然认为这个建议是他们拟定作为部分裁军的全部措施中的一个不可分割的部分，它是不能够独立解决的。这一点现在不可避免地成为立刻停止试验的障碍，因为关于裁军的局部措施还没有达成协议，在这个局部协议的一切问题上目前也还没有取得一致意见。因此，西方国家的新建议在这种意义上并不能改变现存的情况。西方国家像过去一样，坚持要在签订裁军局部措施的共同协议以后才能停止试验。在这方面，它们的态度毫无改变。
    至于停止这种试验同停止裂变物质生产的关系问题，西方的建议仍然坚持必须先就停止生产问题达成原则上的协议。同时，西方国家一直反对禁止原子武器，反对不使用这类武器和取消各国军备中的这类武器。因此，西方国家以前那种立场今天在这里仍然没有任何改变。
    佐林说，苏联在过去和现在始终站在这种立场上：不能把禁止试验跟局部裁军的其他措施连在一起。不然，就会拖延这项问题的解决，并且会使这个简单的问题陷入一大堆复杂的问题中去。
    佐林指出，关于停止试验的期限问题，史塔生说现在的建议同过去不同，这是不正确的。过去西方国家说期限是十个月，然后再在这个时期里决定期限是否要延长；而现在提出的是把这个停止试验的时期延长到十二个月，就是延长了两个月，然后要在这个期限里决定是否再将期限延长，甚至说还可以延长到两年。但是这个过渡仍然要取决于是否接受西方国家的条件：停止生产裂变物质而不禁止原子武器和销毁国家军备中现有的这种武器。
    裁军小组委员会会议将在8月27日继续举行。
