Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, August 4th. The universities and colleges in Chongqing are summarizing the major victory of the anti-Rightist struggle over the past month, and further mobilizing the masses to expose the few stubborn Rightist elements.

The nine universities and colleges in Chongqing successively began to counterattack the Rightists from late June. More than 16,000 teachers and students from various schools participated in the anti-Rightist struggle, and more than 40 Rightist small groups were exposed. At the beginning of the rectification campaign in various schools, a handful of Rightist backbone elements, relying on these small groups, launched a frantic attack on the Communist Party and the cause of socialism. They first attacked the Communist Party's leadership over universities and colleges. The Rightist group composed of professors Luo Rongzi and Chen Dongyuan, and lecturer Dong Shiguang of Southwest Normal College, and the small group headed by Zhao Changgeng, director of the Design Teaching and Research Section of Chongqing Institute of Architectural Engineering, deliberately exaggerated and fabricated shortcomings in the work of the school to prove their so-called shameless lies such as "the Party committee leadership system is a hotbed of the three majorisms." These Rightist elements frantically clamored for the Party committee to "withdraw from the school," and put forward slogans such as "professors govern the school" and "democratic school management" in order to achieve the goal of usurping the leadership of the school. The Rightist backbone elements also included the small group formed by Zhang Jingxiu (Zhou Nanshi) and Cui Yan of Southwest Academy of Fine Arts, and Deng Jiyu of Chongqing University.

These once arrogant Rightist elements have been exposed under the counterattack of the masses. Some small groups have collapsed, and some have been completely isolated among the masses. The Rightist small group headed by Zhao Changgeng of Chongqing Institute of Architectural Engineering once incited some students to make trouble and strike. Pu Yuqing and other deceived students accused the chief Rightist element of poisoning young people at the mass meeting.

The teachers and students of various schools have undergone this major test, and their class consciousness and political enthusiasm have been greatly improved. Many old professors in their sixties and seventies braved the sweltering heat and participated in various meetings with young people, actively striving to speak. Some teachers participated in collecting materials, writing big-character posters, and mimeographing newspapers, just like the students. In order to refute Zhu Yonglong, a Rightist element in their department, the teachers and students of the Department of History of Southwest Normal College held more than 50 meetings of various sizes, forcing this stubborn Rightist element to bow his head in the face of a large number of facts.

    重庆各高等学校反右派斗争获重大胜利
    正深入揭露少数顽抗分子
    据新华社重庆4日电　重庆市各高等学校这几天都在总结一个多月来反右派斗争的重大胜利，并进一步动员群众揭露少数顽抗的右派分子。
    重庆九所大专学校先后从6月下旬开始对右派分子进行反击。各校参加反右派斗争的教师和学生共有一万六千多人，先后揭露出四十多个右派小集团。在各校整风开始时，一小撮右派骨干分子依托这些小集团，向共产党和社会主义事业发动了猖狂的进攻，他们首先是攻击共产党对高等学校的领导。西南师范学院以教授罗容梓、陈东原，讲师董时光组成的右派集团，重庆建筑工程学院以设计教研组主任赵长庚为首的小集团，都是故意夸大、捏造学校工作中的缺点，以证明他们所谓的“党委领导制是三大主义的温床”等无耻谰言。这些右派分子疯狂叫嚣党委“退出学校”，提出什么“教授治校”、“民主办校”等口号，以达到篡夺学校领导权的目的。右派骨干分子还有西南美术专科学校的章晶修（周南士）、崔炎等人组成的小集团，重庆大学邓季雨等。
    这些嚣张一时的右派分子在群众的反击下，原形毕露，有的小集团已经土崩瓦解，有的已在群众中完全孤立。重庆建筑工程学院以赵长庚为首的右派小集团曾煽动部分学生闹事、罢课，受骗的学生蒲玉清等在群众大会上控诉了这个右派首脑分子毒害青年的罪恶。
    各校师生经受了这一场重大的考验，阶级觉悟和政治热情大大提高。不少六、七十岁的老教授冒着酷热，同年青人一起参加各种会议，积极争取发言。有些教师和学生一样，参加收集材料、编写大字报、油印报等工作。西南师范学院历史系的师生为了驳倒本系的右派分子朱永隆，先后举行大小会议五十多次，使这个顽固的右派分子不得不在大量的事实面前低头。
