Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 8th. A large-scale struggle to counterattack bourgeois right-wing elements is unfolding among engineering and technical personnel and staff in medium-sized and large state-owned factories and mines in ten cities of Liaoning Province, including Shenyang, Dalian, Anshan, Fushun, and Jinzhou. The exposed right-wing elements have already become isolated among the workers; the broad masses of workers have received a vivid class education through the struggle. Ouyang Diguang, a staff member and right-wing element at the Dalian Chemical Plant, came from a landlord family and participated in the Kuomintang. He openly clamored that it was the peasants' debt to the landlords if they could not pay the rent; that the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements violated the constitution, and that the people had become frightened birds because of these movements; and that the so-called people's democratic dictatorship was just cadres dictating to the people. The workers have held rallies for days to launch a fierce struggle against this right-wing element.

Shen Naimin, an engineer and right-wing element at the Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Department, slandered the new society as "a society where tigers eat people" and called those close to the Party "Ah Q" and "those who sharpen their heads to drill their way in." He himself said that he treated Communist Party members "as strangers and regarded them as enemies." In the struggle, the workers thoroughly exposed Shen Naimin's ugly face and revealed his past: his father was a lieutenant general in the Kuomintang era, he used to be a "young master," the wedding officiant was Chen Lifu's father, and he was one of the Kuomintang officials who took over Anshan Iron and Steel.

Yuan Naiqin of the Fuxin Haizhou Open-pit Mine is a political schemer in the guise of an engineer. He was among the first group of non-Party technical cadres selected by the Party in 1951 to study in the Soviet Union. Soon after returning to China, he was promoted to engineer, and this year he was recommended by the CPC Fuxin Municipal Committee as a member of the Liaoning Provincial CPPCC. However, this right-wing schemer completely repaid kindness with malice, wooing the masses, isolating and squeezing out Party member technical cadres, and colluding with Chai Shou'an, a right-wing element in the Civil League, actively collecting opinions of dissatisfaction with the Party. After joining the Jiusan Society, Yuan Naiqin used inducement to develop the organization in the city's major factories and mines, and openly undermined the Communist Youth League by drawing CYL members into the society.

Wu Chengyao, acting chief engineer and right-wing element of the Fushun Petroleum Installation Company, not only tried every means to provoke the relationship between the Party and intellectuals, but also actively responded to Zhang Bojun's call to "develop democratic party organizations to several million people," attempting to establish a Civil League branch in the company to achieve the ambition of replacing the Party's leadership with the league.

    辽宁省十个城市中的工矿企业 
    展开声势浩大的反右派斗争
    新华社沈阳8日电　辽宁省沈阳、大连、鞍山、抚顺、锦州等十个城市中型以上的国营厂矿，在工程技术人员和职员中正展开一个声势浩大的反击资产阶级右派分子的斗争。被揭发出来的右派分子，已经在职工群众中陷于孤立；广大职工通过斗争受到了一次活生生的阶级教育。大连化学厂职员、右派分子欧阳迪光，出身于地主家庭，并参加过国民党。他公然叫嚣农民交不上地主的租子是农民欠地主的债；“三反”“肃反”运动是违犯宪法的，由于这些运动，人民已经成了惊弓之鸟；所谓人民民主专政就是干部专人民的政。职工们连日召开大会对这个右派分子展开了激烈的斗争。
    鞍钢基建处工程师、右派分子沈乃敏，污蔑新社会是“老虎吃人的社会”，把靠近党的人称作“阿Q”、“削尖了头往里钻”。他自己说他对共产党员是“以路人视之，以敌人待之”。职工们在斗争中对沈乃敏的丑恶面目揭露无遗，并且揭开了他的老底，原来他的父亲是国民党时代的中将，他过去是“公子”，结婚时主婚人是陈立夫的父亲，国民党接收鞍钢时他是接收大员之一。
    阜新海州露天矿袁乃勤，是个披着工程师外衣的政治野心家。他是1951年党选拔第一批去苏联学习的非党技术干部，回国后不久即被提拔为工程师，今年又被中共阜新市委推荐为辽宁省政协委员。但是这个右派野心家完全以怨报德，拉拢群众，孤立和排挤党员技术干部，并和市民盟右派分子柴寿安串通一气，积极搜集对党不满的意见。袁乃勤加入九三学社以后，以引诱拉拢的办法，在全市各主要厂矿发展组织，并公然挖共青团的“墙脚”，拉共青团员入社。
    抚顺石油安装公司代总工程师、右派分子乌承尧不仅千方百计挑拨党和知识分子的关系，而且积极响应章伯钧“把民主党派组织发展到几百万人”的号召，企图在公司里成立民盟支部，达到以盟代党的领导野心。
