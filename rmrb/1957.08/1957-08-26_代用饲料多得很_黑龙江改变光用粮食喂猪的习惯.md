Many Substitute Feeds Available
Heilongjiang Changes Habit of Only Using Grain to Feed Pigs

(Our report) Farmers in Heilongjiang Province are changing their habit of feeding pigs entirely with grain and are widely using other substitute feeds besides grain to raise pigs. This saves grain, and the pigs are raised well. The substitute feeds they use are mostly wild plants, vegetable by-products, industrial by-products, and grain by-products, totaling more than 100 kinds. Among them, green fodder (i.e., wild plants and vegetable by-products) is the most used. Scientific verification by relevant departments has proved that green fodder, after fermentation, produces a sweet and sour smell, which pigs like to eat, is easy to digest, and helps fattening. Last year, Gongzheng Agricultural Cooperative in Keshan County raised 2,865 pigs, including 671 fattened pigs, which were fed with more than 100,000 jin of grass seeds, 40 hectares of beet leaves, and 180,000 jin of powder residue. Guan Pengyi, a pig-raising expert in Keshan County, raised 31 pigs last year, almost all fed with wild vegetables and beet leaves.

Heilongjiang Province has a wide range of sources for green fodder and other substitute feeds. According to statistics from relevant departments, this year, the vegetable by-products from feed land, the by-products of agricultural crops, and the wild plants collected by each pig-raising household total 2 million tons of green fodder and other substitute feeds. Based on 5.2 million pigs raised in the province, this can be used for seven months. If we add the utilization of grain by-products, the province's pig feed is basically sufficient this year.

    代用饲料多得很
　　黑龙江改变光用粮食喂猪的习惯
    本报讯　黑龙江省农民改变完全用粮食喂猪的习惯，广泛利用粮食以外的其他代用饲料养猪，既节约了粮食，猪也养得不错。他们采用的代用饲料多是野生植物、蔬菜副产品、工业副产品、粮食副产品，约计共有一百余种。其中青饲料（即野生植物和蔬菜副产品）被利用得最多。据有关部门科学化验证明，青饲料经过发酵，产生酸甜气味，猪喜欢吃，易于消化，有助于育肥。去年克山县公正农业社养了二千八百六十五口猪，其中有育成肥猪六百七十一口，就是用十万多斤草籽、四十公顷地的甜菜叶子、十八万斤粉渣子等喂出来的。克山县养猪能手关鹏义，去年用代用饲料养了三十一口猪，几乎全是喂的野菜和甜菜叶子。
    黑龙江省的青饲料和其他代用饲料的来源较广，根据有关部门调查统计，今年全省饲料地的蔬菜副产品、农作物的副产品及每个养猪农户采集的野生植物，共有青饲料及其他代用饲料共有二百万吨。全省按养猪五百二十万口计算，可供七个月之用。如果再加上对粮食副产品的利用，今年全省养猪饲料基本够用。
