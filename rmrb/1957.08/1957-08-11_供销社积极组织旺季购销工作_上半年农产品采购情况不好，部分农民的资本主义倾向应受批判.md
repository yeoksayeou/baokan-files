Xinhua News Agency report: The national supply and marketing cooperative system has begun preparations for the peak season procurement of agricultural products and the supply of materials.

The All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives recently convened a meeting of heads of supply and marketing cooperatives from northern provinces and cities to discuss peak season procurement and supply issues. At the same time, meetings were also held in Shanghai, Changsha, Xi'an, Chengdu and other places to deploy this work.

According to statistics compiled from reports from various provinces and cities, in the first half of this year, the national supply and marketing cooperative system only completed 33.7% of the annual procurement plan. The procurement of major agricultural products such as flue-cured tobacco, hemp, tea, and cotton was very poor, and most of the tasks have to be completed in the second half of the year. On the supply side, 44.7% of the annual plan was completed in the first half of the year. Among them, sales of new-style agricultural implements and phosphate fertilizer, which belong to the means of production, were low, while the supply of daily necessities such as cotton cloth and its products and sugar was insufficient.

The heads of supply and marketing cooperatives from northern provinces and cities reflected at the symposium that this year, except for some disaster-stricken areas, the growth of crops in most areas is good, which is a favorable condition for completing the procurement plan for agricultural products in the second half of the year. However, the work is still quite arduous, because the state wants to purchase more agricultural products that fall under the categories of state-controlled purchase and unified purchase according to the plan, while some farmers still have reluctance to sell or want to sell them in the free market.

The heads of supply and marketing cooperatives in various provinces and cities believe that overcoming the contradictions between the state and farmers is the key to completing this year's agricultural product procurement plan. Therefore, it is necessary to educate farmers to recognize the benefits of state-controlled purchase and unified purchase, criticize the capitalist tendencies of some farmers, and also overcome the non-socialist ideological tendencies of one-sided mass viewpoints, departmentalism, and individualism among cadres. For materials that should be controlled, resolutely manage them; for materials that should be open to the free market, resolutely open them. For private merchants, they must be educated to abide by state policies and market management.

Supply and marketing cooperatives must cooperate with relevant departments to promote the development of agricultural production, and cultivate production bases for tobacco, hemp, tea, moso bamboo, etc., to solve the problem of supply from the development of production; secondly, they must go to mountainous and remote areas to find new sources of supply.

In terms of material supply, there is still a gap between the supply of materials in northern provinces and cities and the purchasing power of the masses. All localities must actively organize local sources of supply and explore new commodities and substitutes.

    供销社积极组织旺季购销工作
    上半年农产品采购情况不好，部分农民的资本主义倾向应受批判
    据新华社讯　全国供销合作社系统开始准备旺季农产品采购和物资供应工作。
    全国总社在最近召集北方各省、市供销社负责人，座谈了旺季的采购和供应问题。与此同时，还在上海、长沙、西安、成都等地，分别召开会议部署这项工作。
    根据各省、市汇报的材料统计，今年上半年全国供销社系统仅完成全年采购计划的33.7％，主要农产品如烤烟、麻、茶叶、棉花等的采购情况都很差，大部分任务要集中在下半年完成。供应方面，上半年完成全年计划的44.7％，其中主要是生产资料中的新式农具和磷肥销售的少，棉布及其制品和糖等日用品则供应不足。
    北方各省市供销合作社负责人在座谈会上反映，今年除部分受灾地区以外，大部分地区农作物生长情况良好，这是下半年完成农产品采购计划的有利条件。但是工作还是相当艰巨的，因为国家要按计划多收购一些属于统购和统一收购的农产品，而部分农民还有惜售情绪或者想拿到自由市场去出售。
    各省市供销社负责人认为克服国家同农民之间的矛盾，是完成今年农产品采购计划的关键。因此，要教育农民认识统购和统一收购的好处，批判部分农民中的资本主义倾向，也要克服干部中的片面群众观点、本位主义、个人主义等等非社会主义思想倾向，对于该管的物资坚决管理，该开放自由市场的物资坚决开放。对于私商，要教育他们遵守国家政策和市场管理。
    供销社必须配合有关部门促进农业生产的发展，并培养烟、麻、茶、毛竹等生产基地，从发展生产中解决货源问题；其次要到山区和边远地区去寻找新的货源。
    在物资供应方面，北方各省、市物资供应量同群众购买力之间还有距离，各地必须自行积极地组织地方货源，发掘新商品和代用品。
