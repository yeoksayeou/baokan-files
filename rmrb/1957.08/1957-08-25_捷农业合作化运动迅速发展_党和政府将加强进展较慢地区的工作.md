    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 24th (Reporter Li Yanning) reports: Since the beginning of August, the Czechoslovak agricultural cooperation movement has continued to develop at a speed unseen in recent years.

    In the first twenty days of August, 600 new Unified Agricultural Cooperatives were established nationwide, which is 200 more than the entire month of July, which had excellent results in cooperation; equivalent to the total number of agricultural cooperatives established from January to June this year; and about half of the total for the entire year of 1956, which was also a good year for cooperation.

    In the first twenty days of August, an average of thirty agricultural cooperatives were established every day, which is more than nine times the average speed in the first six months of this year.

    Since the beginning of this year, Czechoslovakia has established a total of 1,600 agricultural cooperatives, possessing more than 304,000 hectares of arable land. To date, there are 9,600 Unified Agricultural Cooperatives nationwide. These established cooperatives are of decisive significance for fulfilling the target of increasing agricultural production by 30% as stipulated in the Second Five-Year Plan, because they will make a greater contribution to the increase in agricultural products than the new cooperatives established in the coming years.

  However, from a national perspective, the development of the agricultural cooperation movement is not balanced enough. According to statistics for August, among the 19 states in the country, 6 states have cooperative arable land exceeding half of the total arable land in the state, 10 states have cooperative arable land accounting for 30% to 50% of the total arable land, and 3 states have less than 30%. Development is also uneven within states and counties. The development in the Slovak region lags behind the Czech region. As of the end of July, socialist agriculture accounted for 56% of the total arable land in the Czech region, while it only accounted for 40% in the Slovak region.

    Recently, the Communist Party and the government of Czechoslovakia have both emphasized this imbalance, requiring that political and ideological work among farmers be strengthened in areas where the agricultural cooperation movement is progressing slowly (especially in areas with abundant agricultural production), and that the cooperation movement in these areas be vigorously promoted.

    据新华社布拉格24日电　本社记者李延宁报道：8月初以来，捷克斯洛伐克农业合作化运动以几年来从未有过的速度继续向前发展。
    在8月份的头二十天内，全国新成立了六百个统一农业合作社，比合作化成绩优异的今年7月份全月还多建立了二百个；相当于今年1月到6月成立的农业合作社的总和；约等于合作化成绩相当好的1956年全年的一半。
    在8月份的头二十天中，每天平均建立三十个农业合作社，这个速度达到了今年头六个月平均速度的九倍多。
    从今年年初以来，捷克斯洛伐克共建立了一千六百个农业合作社，它们拥有三十万四千多公顷耕地。到目前为止，全国共有九千六百个统一农业合作社。这些已经成立的合作社对于完成第二个五年计划所规定的农业增产30％的指标具有决定的意义，因为它们将会比明、后年成立的新社对农产品的增产作出更大的贡献。
  但是，从全国范围来看，农业合作化运动的发展是不够平衡的。根据8月份的统计，全国十九个州中，合作社耕地超过本州耕地总面积一半的有六个州，占耕地总面积30％到50％的有十个州，不足30％的有三个州。在各州和各县内发展也不平衡。斯洛伐克地区的发展落后于捷克地区，至7月底，社会主义农业在捷克地区占耕地总面积56％，在斯洛伐克地区还只占40％。
    最近，捷克斯洛伐克共产党和政府都强调指出这种不平衡现象，要求在农业合作化运动进展较慢的地区（特别是其中的农业丰产区），加强在农民中的政治思想工作，大力推进这类地区的合作化运动。
