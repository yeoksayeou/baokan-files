　　Rakshasa Fears the Sun
　　Han Changgeng
  Rakshasa is a common term in Buddhist scriptures, a transliteration of the Sanskrit word Rakshasa, meaning a terrifying and violent person, also a kind of demon that specializes in eating people. There is a Rakshasa male with red hair, a black body, and green eyes, and there is also a Rakshasa female who often disguises herself as an unparalleled beauty. They use various methods to conceal their man-eating faces, luring people into traps.

    The Buddhist scripture "Treatise on the Great Perfection of Wisdom" records a thought-provoking story.

    A young man, full of beautiful fantasies, also liked to explore new things everywhere. One day, he was walking alone in the wilderness, hoping to find something strange. Unfortunately, he was captured by a disguised Rakshasa, who wanted to find a suitable place to eat him, so he led him in the direction of darkness. The further he went, the more the young man felt that something was wrong, but he could not escape. At this time, he looked up and suddenly found that the Rakshasa's body was white in front and black in the back. The curious young man couldn't understand it, so he asked the Rakshasa. The Rakshasa said, "I have never liked to see the sun in my life, and I always walk with my back to the sun, so my front body is white and my back body is black." The young man suddenly understood, and used all his strength to pull the Rakshasa to face the sun. The Rakshasa was afraid of the sun, so he had to turn around and flee. The young man was thus freed from the Rakshasa's hands.

    Being full of fantasy is a valuable trait of young people, and pursuing novelty and hunting for the strange is also a characteristic of youth, but after all, they are young and lack social experience, and their ability to distinguish right from wrong is limited. Fantasies can easily become detached from reality, and they can become biased when their minds are hot. These are exactly the opportunities that Rakshasas take advantage of by leading them by the nose. To deal with them, we can only use the method of the young man in the "Treatise on the Great Perfection of Wisdom" to deal with the Rakshasa, and move towards the sun—socialism, because the Rakshasa is most afraid of seeing the sun.

　　罗刹怕太阳
　　韩长耕
  罗刹是佛经中常见的一个名词，是梵文罗沙婆的音译，是可怕的强暴者，也是一种专门吃人的魔鬼。有一种罗刹男，朱发黑身绿眼，又有一种罗刹女，常常乔装成绝代美人。他们用各式各样的方法把自己吃人的面目掩盖起来，引诱人陷入圈套。
    佛教藏经“智度论”里记述了一个耐人玩味的故事。
    有一位年青人，富于美好的幻想，也喜欢到处去探索新鲜事物。有一天，他在旷野里踽踽独行，希望找到一点什么奇异。不幸被一个乔装的罗刹掳获了，罗刹想找个合适的地方吃掉他，就引导他朝着黑暗的方向走去。越往前走，年青人越感到了不对头，但已无法解脱。这时候，他一抬头，忽然发现罗刹身上前白后黑，好奇的青年又不能理解了，就请教罗刹。罗刹说：“我一生从不喜见太阳，总是背着太阳走，所以前身白，后身黑。”年青人恍然大悟，就使尽全身气力，拉着罗刹面向太阳，罗刹怕太阳，只好掉头而逃。青年人也就从罗刹的手中解脱了。
    富于幻想是青年人可贵的地方，追奇猎异也是青年的特点，但毕竟年事较轻，社会经验不足，辨别是非能力有限，幻想很容易脱离实际，脑子一热，又会偏激。这都是罗刹们正好牵着鼻子利用的机会。对付它们，只有用“智度论”里那个青年对付罗刹的办法，向着太阳——社会主义走，因为罗刹最怕见太阳。
