Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 25th: The CPC Jingzhou Regional Committee in Hubei Province recently instructed all counties to promptly prevent extravagance and waste among the masses after the bumper harvest.

The CPC Jingzhou Regional Committee pointed out to its subordinate counties that the early rice and mid-season rice crops in Jingzhou Prefecture have generally achieved bumper harvests, and a bumper cotton harvest is also expected. In the context of a bumper harvest, extravagance and waste have already emerged in rural areas. According to an inspection by the Qiaoshi Guidance Group in Jianli County of fifty-one agricultural cooperatives, forty-nine cooperatives burned incense and worshiped gods, wasting 550 yuan. In Hebao Township, all ten cooperatives performed operas and held Taoist ceremonies, averaging over 50 yuan spent per cooperative. In the Fenghuang Cooperative in Jingxi Township, Jiangling County, eighteen members had already bought watches in Shashi, and some others planned to buy them after the autumn harvest. The Han Gang Cooperative in Tangwan Township, Mianyang County, spent 1,240 yuan to build an office for the cooperative. Among the seven production teams in this cooperative, four teams also built team offices, spending a total of 1,600 yuan. The Yangguang Cooperative in Fengqiao Township, Mianyang County, built a large office that could serve as both a warehouse and a movie screening room. This cooperative also planned to spend 8,000 catties of grain to put on operas. A cooperative director in Fengqiao Township said, "We have a bumper harvest this year, so it doesn't matter if we spend money recklessly!"

After receiving the instructions from the Regional Committee, all counties in Jingzhou Prefecture emphasized the advantages of frugality and the harms of waste in the recent three-level cadre meetings and Party member training sessions, calling on all rural cadres, Party members, and Youth League members to take the lead in practicing thrift. After the cadre meetings, many counties immediately implemented the spirit of the Regional Committee's instructions in townships and agricultural cooperatives. It is understood that Shishou, Jiangling, Jingmen, Gong'an, Qianjiang, and other counties have 1,856 cooperatives that have formulated detailed harvesting plans during the rice harvesting period, and have also mobilized members to formulate frugal household management plans. Jiangling County launched a campaign to promote increased production and thrift in Jiangtai Township. Party members, Youth League members, and township and cooperative cadres took the lead in formulating four guarantees: no gambling or playing cards, no extravagance or waste, no seeking gods or worshiping Buddha, and educating the masses well.

    荆州地区广泛教育农民群众
　　丰收不忘勤俭　正确安排家计
　  据新华社武汉25日电　中共湖北省荆州地委最近指示各县，及时防止丰收后群众中的铺张浪费行为的发生。
    中共荆州地委向所属各县指出，荆州专区早稻、中稻普遍获得丰收，棉花丰收也在望。在丰收的情况下，农村已经出现铺张浪费的现象。据监利县桥市指导组对五十一个农业社的检查，有四十九个社烧香敬神，浪费五百五十元；何保乡的十个社，社社唱戏、打醮，平均每个社花五十多元。江陵县荆西乡凤凰社已有十八个社员在沙市买了手表，还有一部分人打算秋收后再去买。沔阳县塘塆乡韩刚社，花一千二百四十元修建社里的办公室。这个社七个生产队中，有四个队还修了队办公室，共花钱一千六百元。沔阳县冯桥乡杨光社修建一个大办公室，既能作仓库，又能放映电影。这个社还准备花八千斤谷子来唱戏。冯桥乡有个社主任说：“今年我们丰收了，乱花点钱不要紧！”
    荆州专区各县接到地委的指示以后，都在最近召开的三级干部会和党员集训会上，着重地讲了节约和浪费的利害关系，号召全体农村干部、党员、团员带头节约。不少县在干部会议结束后，立即把地委的指示精神贯彻到乡和农业社里去。据了解：石首、江陵、荆门、公安、潜江等县，已有一千八百五十六个社在收割稻谷期间，订了细收细打的计划，还发动社员订了勤俭理家的计划。江陵县将台乡开展了增产节约宣传运动，全乡党员、团员和乡、社干部带头制订了四大保证：一不赌博抹牌，二不铺张浪费，三不求神拜佛，四要教育好群众。
