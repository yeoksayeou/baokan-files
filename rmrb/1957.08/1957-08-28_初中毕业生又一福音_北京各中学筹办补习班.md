Another Good News for Junior High Graduates
Beijing Middle Schools Prepare to Run Tutoring Classes

    (Our newspaper reports) Many middle schools in Beijing are actively preparing to run tutoring classes for junior high school graduates. Most have drafted plans for setting up classes and have determined the start dates. They will also hold parent-teacher meetings soon and establish parent committees. The 13th, 24th, and 41st Middle Schools have already held parent-teacher meetings, and the parents who attended unanimously expressed their willingness to support the schools in doing this work well.

    The tutoring content in each school mainly focuses on the three subjects of Chinese, Mathematics, and Politics in the third year of junior high school. Classes are generally held in the morning or evening, with two or three lessons each day. The 41st Middle School has specially arranged two classrooms for the tutoring classes, with two lessons in the morning and two sessions of self-study.

    The teachers for the tutoring classes are generally concurrently held by third-year junior high school teachers. In addition to hiring part-time teachers to teach, the 40th, 41st, 49th, and 53rd Middle Schools are also planning to hire one or two counselors to strengthen the tutoring work in the tutoring classes. The counselor of the 40th Middle School tutoring class also teaches one course.

    Most schools' tutoring classes take the form of classroom teaching, while a few schools, such as the 40th Middle School, plan to combine classroom teaching with radio lectures due to difficulties in staffing. Their method is as follows: listen to the radio for Chinese, Algebra, and Politics, and face-to-face instruction for Geometry (because radio lectures do not broadcast Geometry). The 39th Middle School only listens to the radio for the Politics course. (Fu Dong)

    初中毕业生又一福音
　　北京各中学筹办补习班
    本报讯　北京市许多中等学校正在积极筹办初中毕业生补习班，大部已拟定了设班计划，规定了开班日期，并将于最近召开家长座谈会，建立家长委员会。十三中、二十四中、四十一中已经开过家长座谈会，到会家长一致表示愿意支持学校作好这件工作。
    各校补习内容多以初三语文、数学、政治三科为主；上课时间一般是在上午或晚上，每天上二或三节课。四十一中特为补习班安排出二个教室，上午上课二节，自学二节。
    补习班的教师，一般由初三教师兼任。四十中、四十一中、四十九中和五十三中除聘请兼任教师教课外，还准备再聘请辅导员一、二人，加强补习班的辅导工作。四十中补习班的辅导员还兼教一门课。
    大多数学校的补习班采取课堂教学形式，有少数学校，如四十中，因师资有困难，打算采取课堂教学与广播讲座相结合的形式。他们的办法是：语文、代数、政治收听广播，几何面授（因广播讲座不广播几何）。三十九中只政治一课收听广播。　　　　　　　（傅冬）
