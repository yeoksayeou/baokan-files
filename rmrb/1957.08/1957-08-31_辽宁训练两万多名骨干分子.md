Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 30th: A major debate centered on the issue of unified purchase and sale of grain has spread to most villages in Liaoning Province. This major debate will continue until the autumn harvest begins.

The leadership force invested in this socialist education movement throughout the province is comparable to the high tide of cooperativization in the spring of 1956. In mid-to-late August, various counties trained over 20,000 district and township cadres, rural activists, and several thousand cadres sent down from various government agencies through meetings.
