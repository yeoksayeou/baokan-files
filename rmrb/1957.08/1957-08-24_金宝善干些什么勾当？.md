Jin Baoshan, a rightist element in the Department of Health of Beijing Medical College, is a long-planned conspirator against the Party and socialism. Although he adopted extremely covert double-dealing tactics, often appearing as a respected "public health expert," his complete set of strategies and programs for attacking the Party and his ambition to usurp leadership of the health department have been exposed under the bright eyes of the people.

To achieve his vile goals, Jin Baoshan first sought and amplified shortcomings in preventive health work to attack the Ministry of Health. In the winter of 1956, Jin Baoshan took advantage of the opportunity of CPPCC members' inspections to deliberately collect shortcomings everywhere. After the inspection, he wrote "articles" and published them, depicting the health undertakings after liberation as a complete mess. Not only that, but he also used every opportunity to attack the Party. He printed and distributed a letter from a backward-thinking health physician to slander the Party's leadership; he gave inflammatory speeches; he used the CPPCC to hold ignition-style seminars; he even used the reception of foreign medical delegations to visit various parts of the country to ignite trouble.

He falsely accused: Our "medical institutions are limited to the treatment of patients, and no clear arrangements have been made for disease prevention work;" "not enough attention has been paid early on to parasitic diseases that are extremely harmful to people's health, such as schistosomiasis and malaria;" "children's health care has not yet been developed;" "medical education departments have not paid attention to training health and epidemic prevention personnel, but only doctors who treat diseases." He even said that some good preventive health systems before liberation have now been abolished. The reason for these shortcomings is that "leaders from the Ministry of Health to the Central Committee of the Communist Party lack preventive thinking."

But what are the facts? The policy of prevention first was put forward by the Ministry of Health of New China. No one put forward this policy before liberation. Look at the development of medical and preventive institutions. Taking 1947 as 100, by 1956, hospital beds were 398.1, sanatorium beds were 22,074.3, clinics and district health centers were 3,279.6, and maternal and child health centers were 50,711. Health and epidemic prevention stations were a blank space before liberation. After liberation, they started from scratch, and by 1956, 1,260 had been established (not including 204 county health and epidemic prevention teams, nor various infectious disease prevention and control institutions). The development of the patriotic health movement has greatly improved the health level of our people.

As for schistosomiasis, malaria, kala-azar, and other acute infectious diseases, before liberation, they spread arbitrarily among the people without any control. After liberation, amazing achievements have been made in prevention and treatment. Not long ago, Soviet expert Polderev criticized other countries' methods of fighting schistosomiasis at the Tenth World Health Organization Conference in Geneva and introduced China's comprehensive measures for schistosomiasis, which aroused great interest among the participants. In terms of maternal and child health, due to the widespread promotion of new-method delivery, the widespread establishment of children's health care institutions, and the development of school health, children's health levels are also improving year by year. After liberation, the Ministry of Health also established health departments in six medical colleges and universities across the country from scratch to train health physicians, and also established intermediate health schools in various provinces and cities to train health medical assistants. The graduates of the health departments of New China are opening up health and epidemic prevention work in every corner with the indomitable spirit and the attitude of health vanguards, together with health and epidemic prevention workers across the country.

Due to the reduction of diseases and the improvement of health levels, China's population mortality rate and infant mortality rate have rapidly decreased. Taking Beijing as an example, compared with 1949 and 1956: the population mortality rate decreased from 14.1‰ to 6.7‰, the infant mortality rate decreased from 117.6‰ to 35.1‰, and the maternal mortality rate decreased from 9‰ to 0.5‰. It is rare in the world for the mortality rate to drop so rapidly to this extent in such a short period of time.

Jin Baoshan is very clear about these amazing achievements. But he described the people's health undertakings as a complete darkness, in order to show that the Party cannot lead health undertakings, and only Jin Baoshan can lead them. What kind of "prevention first" is Jin Baoshan peddling? He criticized the Ministry of Health for failing to develop health and epidemic prevention institutions proportionally, but he opposed the establishment of grassroots health and epidemic prevention stations and wanted to peddle British and American-style health centers; he criticized the Ministry of Health for not paying attention to health and epidemic prevention talents, but he opposed the current health department of Beijing Medical College and was obsessed with Harvard University-style public health training colleges and public health nurse training. What Jin Baoshan opposes is the socialist health undertaking under the leadership of the Party, and what he is peddling is a set of fake "public health" that capitalists use to deceive the working people. He also wants to drag the people's health undertakings back to the tragic road before liberation.

Jin Baoshan also seized on the policy of traditional Chinese medicine to attack the Party. When the Party Central Committee criticized Comrade He Cheng in 1955 for distorting the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine, Jin Baoshan righteously criticized the Ministry of Health for correctly implementing the policy on traditional Chinese medicine, and when the Ministry of Health correctly implemented the Party Central Committee's policy on traditional Chinese medicine, he attacked the Ministry of Health, saying: "I don't agree that effective treatment is a scientific method." "Traditional Chinese medicine can only be studied as a cultural heritage, and should not be accepted as modern science." From the double-dealing tactics used by Jin Baoshan on the issue of traditional Chinese medicine, it is not difficult to see that he wants to use the policy of traditional Chinese medicine to oppose the leadership of the Party.

Let us take a look at Jin Baoshan's words and deeds during the rectification movement, and we can further recognize the true face of this rightist element. In his remarks, he subtly promoted his claim that the Party cannot lead science and that laymen cannot lead experts. He said: "After cadres above the director level of the Ministry of Health study at the Marxist-Leninist Academy every year, they can only speak more beautifully in the future." He maliciously slandered the study of Marxism-Leninism, saying: "The current directors of the Ministry of Health are very weak and do not solve problems much, far worse than the Ministry of Health during the Kuomintang period (when he was the director of the Health Administration)." He also slandered: "Currently, the leading organs in charge of health, and even the business organs that actually control leadership, are all Party members. When there is a transfer, it is just a change of position." The day after Chu Anping's fallacies were published in the newspaper, Jin Baoshan said:
"Chu Anping's words are very good. I wanted to say these words three years ago."

In order to realize his anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiracy, Jin Baoshan viciously sowed discord between scientists and the Party in order to achieve the goal of usurping leadership of the health department.

Jin Baoshan disguises himself as a "health expert," but he is actually a complete political careerist. He has always supported Chiang, been pro-American, and anti-Communist. During the Kuomintang period, Jin Baoshan was able to climb to the position of Director of the Health Administration and Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Health in a situation where the British and American factions were in power, despite being a German-Japanese-trained doctor. This was entirely due to his superb skills in flattering the Kuomintang ruling class and his foreign masters, and bullying those below him. When Chen Guofu came to the Health Administration to give instructions in Chongqing, he busied himself with painting houses and repairing roads. He also covered up the heinous crime of Japan spreading plague bacteria in Zhejiang, China in November 1940. He also sent batches of young doctors to work in the "41" hospital of the Sino-American Cooperation Organization, a secret service agency. His reactionary stance is very firm.

This old bureaucrat, who has always been anti-Party, anti-people, pro-Chiang, and pro-American, transformed himself and appeared in the Ministry of Health as a "public health expert," serving as the director of the technical office. But the fox's tail cannot be hidden. In the autumn of 1950, when the Chinese People's Volunteers were crossing the Yalu River in a vigorous manner, he asked for leave to recuperate in Shanghai under the pretext of illness. He left his beard in Shanghai, put on a long robe, and waited for the opportunity to prepare to "take over." Two or three months later, the Volunteers beat the American devils into a panic, and Jin Baoshan shaved his beard and abandoned his robe and returned to Beijing.

In the new society, although Jin Baoshan played double-dealing tactics, his anti-Soviet and pro-American, anti-Communist and anti-socialist remarks were still revealed at any time. In the Department of Health of Beijing Medical College, he slandered the study of the Soviet Union and the implementation of teaching reforms as only focusing on form and not on content; he promoted the idea to students that the scientific level of the United States is higher than that of the Soviet Union; he believed that ideological reform and political study were too much and advocated reducing the number of class hours for political courses; when the interest rate on bank deposits was reduced, he believed that it was a great loss of personal interests. During the land reform, he shed tears for the sympathetic landlords; he believed that the joint state-private ownership was too hasty and that the capitalists' thinking had not been sorted out, causing great chaos.

With ambition in his heart, Jin Baoshan returned to China and, after serving as the director of the technical office of the Ministry of Health, immediately issued a list and transferred troops from home and abroad to deploy his organizational network. He also used his position as the director of the Ministry of Health branch of the Jiusan Society to actively develop members in an attempt to have someone in each department and office to enrich his political capital. Since the Party proposed rectification, Jin Baoshan believed that the time had come. His previous passive and passive mood changed into active and proactive, and he launched a frenzied attack on the Party—inspecting, writing "articles," making reports, organizing seminars, printing and distributing letters, and igniting trouble everywhere, fearing that the world would not be in chaos. He used the CPPCC Medical and Health Group to collude with rightist elements Li Zong'en and Li Jiansheng, maintain close contact, and even help the Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party develop party members in Beijing Medical College.

After the anti-rightist movement began, Jin Baoshan harbored sinister intentions. On the outside, he pretended to be calm. Although he also actively spoke at the anti-rightist conference of Beijing Medical College, the content was empty. When Beijing Medical College and the Council of the Chinese Medical Association began to expose and criticize Jin Baoshan's anti-Communist and anti-socialist words and deeds, Jin Baoshan continued to play double-dealing tactics, pretending to be pitiful on the one hand and making false self-criticisms, while continuing to attack the Party on the other hand, with a very stubborn attitude.

I hereby warn Jin Baoshan: The Chinese Communist Party has led the people to victoriously complete the people's democratic revolution, and now it has victoriously completed the socialist transformation and is leading the people to victoriously carry out socialist construction. The Party has established a rock-solid prestige and a deep affection like a loving mother among the people of the whole country. The frenzied attack of the rightist elements is nothing but hitting a stone with an egg. But the Party is still generous. The Party welcomes everyone to pass the socialist test. There is only one way out for the rightist elements, that is to thoroughly confess and sincerely repent. If this is the case, the door of socialism is still open to him.

　　金宝善干些什么勾当？
　　北京医学院卫生系副主任　叶恭绍
    医药卫生界的右派分子金宝善是蓄谋已久的反党、反社会主义的阴谋家。虽然他采用了极其隐蔽的两面派手法，经常以一个年高望重的“公共卫生专家”的身份出现，但他的一套完整的向党进攻的策略和纲领，和篡夺卫生部门领导权的野心，在人民的雪亮的眼睛下，已经原形毕露了。
    金宝善为了达到他的卑鄙的目的，首先寻找和扩大预防保健工作中的缺点来攻击卫生部，在1956年冬天，金宝善借政协委员视察的机会，有意到处收集缺点，视察回来之后，就写成“文章”发表。把解放后的卫生事业描写成一团糟。不仅如此，他还利用一切的机会向党进攻。他印发一封思想落后的卫生医师的来信来污蔑党的领导；进行煽动式的讲演；他利用政协召开点火式的座谈会；甚至还利用招待外国医学代表团到全国各地参观时进行点火。
    他诬蔑说：我们的“医疗机构只局限于病人的治疗，对预防疾病的工作没有作出明确的安排；“对危害人民健康极为严重的寄生虫病如血吸虫病及疟疾等没有及早给以足够的重视。”“儿童保健事业至今还没有开展。”“医学教育部门没有注意培养卫生防疫人才，而只培养看病的医生。”他甚至说解放以前的一些好的预防保健制度，现在也取消了。产生这些缺点的原因是因为“从卫生部直到中共中央的领导人就没有预防思想。”
    但是，事实又是怎样的呢？预防为主的方针是新中国的卫生部提出的，在解放前谁也没有提出这个方针。请看医疗预防机构的发展，如以1947年为一百，到1956年，医院病床为三百九十八点一，疗养院病床为二万二千零七十四点三，门诊部、区卫生所为三千二百七十九点六，妇幼保健所为五万零七百一十一。卫生防疫站在解放前是个空白点，在解放后空手起家，到1956年已经成立了一千二百六十个（未包括二百零四个县卫生防疫组在内，也未包括各种传染病的防治机构在内）。爱国卫生运动的开展使我国人民的卫生水平大大提高了一步。
    至于谈到血吸虫病、疟疾、黑热病以及其他急性传染病，解放前都是毫无控制的任意在人民中间传播，解放后在预防和治疗上都获得了惊人的成绩。最近不久苏联专家波尔德列夫还在日内瓦第十届世界卫生组织会议上批评了其他国家对于血吸虫病进行斗争的方法，并介绍了我国对血吸虫病的综合措施，博得与会者的很大兴趣。在妇幼卫生方面由于新法接生的普遍推广，儿童保健机构的普遍建立及学校卫生的开展，儿童健康水平也在逐年提高。卫生部又在解放后从无到有地在全国六个医学院校建立了卫生系，培养卫生医师，又在各省市建立了中级卫生学校培养卫生医士。新中国卫生系的毕业生们正在以坚忍不拔的精神，卫生尖兵的姿态与全国的卫生防疫工作者在各个角落里开辟卫生防疫工作。
    由于疾病的减少及卫生水平的提高，我国的人口死亡率及婴儿死亡率迅速降低了。即以北京市1949年同1956年相比为例：人口死亡率由14.1‰降为6.7‰，婴儿死亡率由117.6‰降为35.1‰，产妇死亡率由9‰降为0.5‰。在这样短的时间内死亡率迅速降低到这个程度在世界各国也是少见的。
    金宝善对这些惊人的成绩是很清楚的。但是他却把人民的卫生事业描写成一团漆黑，借以说明党不能领导卫生事业，只有金宝善才能领导。金宝善贩卖的是什么“预防为主”呢？他批评卫生部没有能有比例地发展卫生防疫机构，但是他却反对建立基层卫生防疫站，而要贩卖英美式的卫生所；他批评卫生部没有注意卫生防疫人才，而他又反对目前北京医学院的卫生系，醉心于美国哈佛大学式的公共卫生进修学院及公共卫生护士的训练。金宝善所反对的是党领导下的社会主义的卫生事业，他贩卖的是资本主义欺骗劳动人民的一套假的“公共卫生”。他还想把人民的卫生事业拖回到解放前的悲惨道路上去。
    金宝善又抓住中医政策来向党进攻。当党中央在1955年批判贺诚同志在中医政策上歪曲了党的方针时，金宝善振振有辞的为正确的贯彻中医政策而批评卫生部，而当卫生部正确地执行了党中央的中医政策时，他又攻击卫生部说：“我不同意有疗效就是科学的方法。”“对中医只能当它作一项文化遗产来研究，而不应当作现代科学来接受。”从金宝善在中医问题上所采用的两面派的手法，不难看出他是要借中医政策来反对党的领导。
    我们再看看金宝善整风期间的言行，便可以进一步认清这个右派分子的庐山面目了。在他的言论中极隐蔽地宣传他的党不能领导科学，外行不能领导内行的主张。他说：“卫生部司局长以上的干部每年到马列学院学习后，只不过将来说话可以漂亮些。”他毒恶地污蔑马列主义的学习，他说：“目前卫生部的司局长很弱，不大解决问题，比以前国民党时（他当卫生署长时）的卫生部差的远”。他又污蔑说：“目前卫生主管机构，甚至在业务机构实际掌握领导权的，都是党员同志。遇有调动也不过是换换岗位而已。”当储安平的谬论在报上登出来的第二天，金宝善说：
  “储安平讲的话很好，这些言论我在三年前就想说了。”
    金宝善为了实现他的反党反社会主义阴谋，以达到篡夺卫生部门领导权的目的，他恶毒地挑拨科学家同党的关系。
    金宝善把自己打扮成“卫生专家”，但他实际是一个十足的政治野心家。他一贯拥蒋、亲美、反共，在国民党时期，金宝善以一个德日派的医生，而能在英美派得势的局面下，爬到卫生署长、卫生部副部长的地位完全是靠他对国民党统治阶级和他的外国主子的一味奴颜婢膝、拍上欺下的高妙手法。在重庆时，陈果夫到卫生署训话前，他就忙着刷房子、修马路。他还灭绝天良的一手掩盖起日本在1940年11月在我国浙江散布鼠疫细菌的弥天大罪。他还把一批一批的青年医师送到特务机关中美合作所的“四一”医院去工作。他的反动立场是非常坚定的。
    这个一贯反党、反人民、拥蒋、亲美的旧官僚一变而以“公共卫生专家”的身份出现于卫生部，任技术室的主任了。但是狐狸的尾巴是藏不住的。在1950年秋正当中国人民志愿军轰轰烈烈跨过鸭绿江时，他托辞请假到上海去休养。在上海留下胡须，穿上长袍，等待时机准备“接收”。两三个月之后志愿军把美国鬼子打得抱头鼠窜，金宝善才又割须弃袍回到北京。
    在新社会里金宝善虽然耍着两面派的手法，但是他的反苏亲美、反共反社会主义的言论仍是随时流露着。在北京医学院卫生系他污蔑学习苏联进行教学改革是只重形式，不重内容；对学生宣扬美国的科学水平比苏联高；对思想改造和政治学习认为搞的太多了，主张减少政治课的学时；当银行存款利息减低时，他认为是切身利益的莫大损失。在土地改革时，他为同情地主而落泪；认为公私合营是操之过急，资本家思想还未搞通，造成很大混乱。
    怀着野心的金宝善回国，在卫生部任技术室主任后，立即开出名单，从国内、国外调兵遣将，布置他的组织网。他还利用九三学社卫生部支社主任委员的职务积极发展社员，企图达到每个司、处都有人，以充实他的政治资本。自从党提出整风后，金宝善便认为时候到了。他以前的消极被动情绪，一变而为积极主动，向党猖狂进攻——视察、写“文章”、作报告、组织座谈会、印发信件、到处点火，唯恐天下不乱。他利用政协医药卫生小组与右派分子李宗恩、李健生互相勾结，密切联系，甚至帮助农工民主党在北京医学院发展党员。
    反右派的运动开始后，金宝善便怀着鬼胎，外面假作镇静，在北京医学院的反右派的大会上虽然也积极的发言，但内容空洞无物，当北京医学院及中华医学会理事会开始揭露和批判了金宝善的反共反社会主义的言行，金宝善仍然耍两面派的手法，一面装出一付可怜相，作虚伪的检讨，一面继续向党进攻，态度非常顽抗。
    我正告金宝善：中国共产党领导人民胜利地完成了人民民主革命，现在又胜利地完成了社会主义改造，并正领导着人民胜利地进行社会主义建设。党在全国人民中树立了磐石一般坚强的威信，慈母一般的深厚的感情，右派分子的猖狂进攻，只不过是以卵击石。但是党仍然是宽大的，党欢迎每一个人过社会主义的关，右派分子的出路只有一条，就是彻底交代，真诚悔改。如果这样，社会主义的大门仍是为他开放着的。
