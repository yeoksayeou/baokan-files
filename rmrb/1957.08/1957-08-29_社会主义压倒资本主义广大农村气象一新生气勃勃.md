Socialism Overwhelms Capitalism: A New and Vigorous Atmosphere in the Vast Countryside

    Hunan's Socialist Propaganda Movement Becomes the Driving Force for All Work
    (Our Dispatch) Reporter Gao Changren reports: The socialist propaganda movement, which began in earnest in Hunan Province's rural areas in early August, has become the driving force for all work in just over twenty days.

    This large-scale socialist propaganda movement has primarily driven the province's grain pre-levy and pre-purchase work. Peasants in various areas have raised their socialist consciousness through grain issue debates, distinguished right from wrong, and supported the state's grain unified purchase and sales policy with practical actions. Pingjiang, Liling, Liuyang, and Ningxiang counties all exceeded their pre-levy and pre-purchase tasks before August 20th. In Xiangtan County, after the broad masses of peasants raised their awareness, more than 400 cases of grain speculation and concealed yields were exposed. Currently, the pace of grain entering the warehouse across the province has changed from slow to fast. As of the 24th, the province had completed more than 30% of its pre-levy and pre-purchase tasks.

    As the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of members continues to improve in the movement, agricultural cooperatives have been further consolidated. The Jinquan Cooperative in Xiangtan County, originally a backward cooperative with 137 member households, had 18 households preparing to withdraw from the cooperative under the instigation of bad elements in the previous period, and 30% of the cooperative members were ideologically shaken. Now, after the members recognized the inside story of landlords like Li Jiaxiang and wealthy middle peasants like Xiong Guisheng attempting to sabotage the agricultural cooperative in various ways through struggle, those who originally wanted to withdraw from the cooperative no longer did so, and those who were originally wavering are now firm. Near this cooperative, there are nine individual farming households, and now three of them have applied to join the cooperative. Similar phenomena exist in many other places.

    Because the enemy's sabotage activities have been struck, and the rights and wrongs on the grain issue have been clarified, the peasants' enthusiasm for production has been unprecedentedly high recently. The number of people working in Shaoyang County has increased from 180,000 per day to 240,000 per day. The Dajin Cooperative in Xiangyin County originally planned to plant only 268 mu of late autumn crops, but now it has increased to 350 mu.

    During this period, rural social order has become more stable. Bad phenomena such as making strange remarks, satirizing, and attacking cadres and activists have disappeared. After overcoming right-leaning thoughts and mobilizing the masses to expose the enemy's sabotage activities, many rural work cadres are leading the masses with renewed confidence and continuing to struggle against capitalist ideas.

    Currently, Hunan Province's socialist propaganda movement is developing in depth and comprehensively. Party committees at all levels have gone deep to strengthen leadership and use this powerful driving force to do a good job in grain, autumn production, and consolidating agricultural cooperatives.

    Many Farmers in Fujian Distinguish Major Rights and Wrongs and Guarantee to Sell More Surplus Grain to the State
    (Our Dispatch) The great debate with the theme of unified purchase and sale of grain is vigorously unfolding in the rural areas of Fujian Province. Many areas have clarified the major rights and wrongs on the grain issue through debate, further raised the socialist consciousness of the peasants, and the work of unified purchase and sale of grain is currently progressing smoothly.

    Many areas have conducted a debate on "Who benefits? Who doesn't benefit?" regarding grain black market speculation. Most poor and lower-middle peasants believe that "the grain black market is the return of the 'rice tiger'," which is developing capitalism. If it continues, the unified purchase and sale will not be guaranteed, and the poor peasants will be exploited again.

    After the great debate, cadres and masses actively sold surplus grain to the state, and many areas have even exceeded their tasks. The Nanping Special Zone sold 30% more grain to the state in the first ten days of August than in the same period last year. More than 100 members of the Bianfang Cooperative in Yunxiao County who had "abandoned agriculture for business" also returned to the cooperative, determined not to take the capitalist road. Farmers in many areas have also proposed guarantees not to engage in speculative business, not to conceal land and yield, and to sell more surplus grain to support national construction.

    Guangdong's Production and Grain Purchase Progress Accelerates, Households that Withdrew from Cooperatives Ask to Rejoin
    (Our Dispatch) The socialist propaganda and education movement in the rural areas of Guangdong Province has shifted to a great debate centered on the unified purchase and sale of grain. At present, the rural areas of Guangdong have presented a new atmosphere: evil trends have been suppressed, righteousness has been raised, the socialist consciousness of cadres and masses has greatly improved, the relationship between the Party and the masses has become closer, the withdrawal and division of cooperatives has been basically quelled, and those who withdrew are asking to rejoin. For example, the thirteen cooperatives in Shichuan Township, Chao Yang County, that collapsed after the spring plowing have not only all been restored, but also thirty-two individual households have joined the cooperative. The attendance rate of agricultural cooperative members has generally increased to over 90% to 95%. Production progress has accelerated, and the province basically completed the task of transplanting rice seedlings a few days after the Beginning of Autumn.

    In the areas where the great debate has been launched, serious capitalist spontaneous thoughts and behaviors of some well-to-do middle peasants have been powerfully criticized with concrete and vivid facts. After the Jingxi No. 2 Cooperative in Luoding County refuted the ideas of well-to-do middle peasants who opposed handing over public grain and selling surplus grain, caring only for themselves and not for the country, it completed the task of handing over 43,000 jin of public grain and selling 8,000 jin of surplus grain in two days. In the past, Guangli District, Gaoyao County, stalled after completing 90% of its requisition task; after the debate, it overfulfilled the task by more than 8,000 jin and it is estimated that more than 100,000 jin can be put into storage.

### 社会主义压倒资本主义广大农村气象一新生气勃勃

　　社会主义压倒资本主义广大农村气象一新生气勃勃
    湖南的社会主义宣传运动成为推动一切工作的动力
    本报讯　记者高长任报道：从8月初在湖南省农村全面开展的社会主义宣传运动，仅仅二十多天，就已经成为推动各项工作的动力。
    这个声势浩大的社会主义宣传运动，首先推动了全省粮食预征预购工作。各地农民在粮食问题大辩论中提高了社会主义觉悟，分清了是非，用实际行动拥护国家的粮食统购统销政策。平江、醴陵、浏阳、宁乡四个县在8月20日前，都先后超额完成预征预购任务。湘潭县在广大农民提高觉悟后，有四百多件粮食投机和隐瞒产量的事件被揭发出来。目前全省粮食入库的进度由慢转快，到24日止，全省已完成预征预购任务30％多。
    由于广大社员在运动中社会主义觉悟不断提高，农业社也进一步巩固了。湘潭县金泉社原是个有一百三十七户社员的后进社，前一时期，在坏分子煽动下，有十八户社员准备退社，全社有30％的社员思想动摇。现在，社员们从斗争中识破地主李家祥、富裕中农熊桂生等人企图从各方面破坏农业社的内幕后，原来要退社的不退社了，原来动摇的，现在坚定了。这个社附近有九户单干农民，现在有三户农民申请入社。其他地方类似的现象也不少。
    由于打击了敌人的破坏活动，在粮食问题上又辩明了是非，最近各地农民生产积极性空前高涨。邵阳县每天出工人数由原来每天的十八万人增加到二十四万人。湘阴县大金社原来只计划种二百六十八亩晚秋作物，现在增加到三百五十亩。
    在这一时期，农村社会秩序更加稳定。讲怪话、讽刺、打击干部和积极分子的坏现象，已经绝迹。很多农村工作干部在克服了右倾思想，发动群众揭发敌人的破坏活动以后，又信心百倍地领导群众，继续向资本主义思想进行斗争。
    现在，湖南省的社会主义宣传运动正在深入、全面地向前发展。各级党委都已深入下去，加强领导，运用这个强大的原动力，做好粮食、秋季生产、和巩固农业社的工作。
    福建许多农民分清大是非保证把更多余粮卖给国家
    本报讯　以粮食统购统销为主题的大辩论正在福建省农村中蓬勃地开展。许多地区通过辩论，分清了粮食问题上的大是大非，进一步提高了农民的社会主义觉悟，目前粮食统购统销工作正在顺利进行。
    不少地区对粮食黑市投机行为进行了“对谁有利？对谁没利？”的辩论。大多数贫农和下中农认为“粮食黑市是‘米老虎’还魂”，是发展资本主义，再让搞下去，统购统销就没保障，贫苦农民又要受剥削。
    经过大辩论的地区，干部和群众积极把余粮卖给国家，许多地区还超额完成了任务。南平专区仅8月上旬卖给国家的粮食，就超过去年同期的30％。云霄县边防社一百多个“弃农经商”的社员也回到社里，决心不走资本主义的道路。不少地区农民还提出保证以不做投机生意，不隐瞒土地、产量，多卖余粮支援国家建设。
　　广东生产和购粮进度加快退社户纷纷要求重新回社
    本报讯　广东省的农村社会主义宣传教育运动，已经转入以粮食统购统销为中心的大辩论。目前，广东各地农村面貌已经呈现一片新气象：邪气歪风被压倒了，正气抬头了，干部和群众的社会主义觉悟大大提高，党和群众的关系更加密切，退社、分社风波已基本平息，退社的人正纷纷要求重新回社。如潮阳县石船乡春耕后垮掉的十三个社，现在不仅全部恢复，而且三十二户单干户也入了社。农业社员出勤率普遍提高到90％至95％以上。生产进度加快，全省在立秋后几天就基本上完成了插秧任务。
    已经展开大辩论的地区，对部分富裕中农的严重的资本主义自发思想和行为，以具体生动的事实进行了有力的批判。罗定县镜西二社驳斥了富裕中农反对交公粮、卖余粮的只顾个人、不顾国家的思想后，两天内就完成了交公粮四万三千斤、卖余粮八千斤的任务。过去，高要县广利区征购任务完成了九成后就停滞不前；辩论以后，超额八千多斤完成了任务，估计还可以再入库十多万斤。　（李咏璇）
