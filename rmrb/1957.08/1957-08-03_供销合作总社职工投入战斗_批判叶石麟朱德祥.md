Staff of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Join the Battle
Criticizing Ye Shilin and Zhu Dexiang

(Our Newspaper) News: In the anti-Rightist struggle, staff members of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives relentlessly exposed and sternly criticized Rightists Ye Shilin, Zhu Dexiang, and others.

Ye Shilin, an editor in the "Central Cooperative Communications" editorial office, opposed the people's democratic dictatorship and yearned for bourgeois "democracy." He said, "The Communist Party advocates democratic dictatorship, but in essence, it is a one-party dictatorship, and the democratic parties are just for show." He opposed the leadership of the Communist Party, saying, "If the Communist Party is good, the people can elect you, why emphasize the leadership of the Communist Party!" "Those who fought to win the country don't necessarily have to rule it." He denied all the working methods of the People's Government, saying that there are four types of governments in the world, and China and the Soviet Union belong to the type of "doing good things with bad methods."

Zhu Dexiang, a rightist element in the Native Products Bureau, agreed with Luo Longji's absurd argument for establishing a "Rehabilitation Committee." He said, "It's easy to dodge a spear in the open, but hard to guard against an arrow in the dark," and advocated establishing a "Committee to Prevent Retaliation During Rectification." He slandered the Party's cadre policy. He said that the Party sometimes uses methods towards non-Party cadres who make mistakes that are even more severe than those used against enemies.

    供销合作总社职工投入战斗
    批判叶石麟朱德祥
    本报讯　全国供销合作总社机关职工，在反右派斗争中，对右派分子叶石麟、朱德祥等进行了无情的揭露和严正的批判。
    “中央合作通讯”编辑室编辑叶石麟，反对人民民主专政，向往资产阶级“民主”，他说：“共产党主张民主专政，实质上是一党专政，民主党派是摆样子的。”他反对共产党领导，说：“若是共产党好，人民可以选举你，何必强调共产党领导呢！”“打天下的不必坐天下”。他否认人民政府的一切工作方法，说世界上有四种政府，中国、苏联都属于“用坏方法办好事”的一种。
    土产局右派分子朱德祥，赞同罗隆基成立“平反委员会”的谬论。他说“明枪易躲，暗箭难防”，主张成立“防止整风报复委员会”。他污蔑党的干部政策。他说党对犯错误的非党干部有时候比对待敌人的手段还厉害。
