Scientific Workers Must Be Humble to Transform Themselves
Bei Shizhang, Director of the Institute of Experimental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences

The life of scientific workers in the old society had nothing to be nostalgic about. At that time, it was truly "utterly dark." Even within the scientific community, there was no shortage of vile phenomena such as speculation, trickery, manipulation, and conspiracy. Only those who were willing to do bad things were complacent and in line with the social environment at that time. Honest scientific workers, on the other hand, were pessimistic, disappointed, bullied, humiliated, and even devastated. With the victory of the Liberation War, the dark clouds dissipated, and justice prevailed. It should be said that scientific workers have also been liberated since then. For eight years, the Communist Party has led China, uniting the vast number of scientific workers with the people of the whole country to participate in socialist construction, achieving tremendous achievements, and fundamentally changing the face of the motherland. As Chairman Mao said: "Our country is now unprecedentedly unified"; "A more beautiful future for the motherland is unfolding before us." We scientific workers have compared the old and new societies, and we have long distinguished clearly which party is the most selfless, which system is the most democratic, which path is the most promising, and which government loves the people and cares about science the most. To have the Communist Party lead and to take the socialist road is not just a slogan, but the inner desire of the vast number of scientific workers. I believe that today in our scientific ranks, if there are still people who are unwilling to take the socialist road and want to take the capitalist road, it is the ignorance of the "big intellectuals"; today in our scientific ranks, if there are still people who vainly try to usurp the leadership of scientific work, it is "an ant trying to shake a big tree, ridiculously overestimating itself"; today in our scientific ranks, if there are still people engaging in speculation, trickery, manipulation, conspiracies, etc., they will inevitably be exposed in front of the vast number of scientific workers and will surely be subject to severe criticism.

Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, thoroughly analyzed and forcefully refuted the "Several Opinions on the Problems of China's Scientific System" put forward by Zeng Zhaolun, Qian Weichang, and other five people from the Provisional Research Group on "Scientific Planning Issues" of the China Democratic League Central Committee in his speech at the Fourth Session of the National People's Congress. He affirmed that this document was a thorough anti-socialist scientific program, hiding a very vicious anti-Party and anti-people conspiracy. From the Guangming Daily's short commentary on June 9th, it can be seen that this conspiracy was fully planned. This was just the beginning, and there would be more to come. This is an extremely serious political crime, which has aroused the infinite anger of the vast number of scientific workers. And the proletariat is indeed "generous enough to fill a prime minister's belly," like Zeng Zhaolun, Qian Weichang, and other anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist right-wingers, who are actually enemies of the proletariat. However, the Party regards them as "lost lambs" and tries every means to save them from the quagmire, so that they can repent and reform, and re-enter the gate of socialist transformation. From this alone, we can clearly recognize that the Communist Party protects scientists with meticulous care. In the symposium held by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, scientists exposed and criticized Zeng Zhaolun and Qian Weichang with extremely heavy hearts, and helped them with comradely love. The meeting lasted for five days, but Zeng Zhaolun and Qian Weichang remained indifferent and showed no signs of repentance. This made the scientists present even more indignant.

I am a non-Party scientific worker with a very low political level. However, today the emergence of an anti-socialist scientific program in our scientific community is very shocking to me. From this matter, we have gained experience and lessons, and it is imperative for scientific workers to strengthen their study and transform themselves.

In the eight years since liberation, scientific workers have studied under the cultivation and education of the Party, and have also transformed themselves in combination with various movements. However, after all, we are intellectuals who came from the old society, and the relatively strong bourgeois ideology is not easy to eradicate in a short time. On specific issues, especially when there is a contradiction between individual interests and collective interests, the roots of bourgeois thinking will revive, and it is possible to develop further. In this anti-rightist struggle, we have seen various types of rightists in the scientific community. Some resonated with rightist ideas, some were used by rightists, some colluded with rightists, some became military advisors to rightists, and some even became arrogant careerists among rightists. I believe that these are all manifestations of varying degrees of development of bourgeois thinking. For all these types of rightists, there is only one remedy, and that is to quickly change one's position, smash the bourgeois position, and establish the proletarian position. To establish the proletarian position, one must first get close to the core force of the proletariat—the Communist Party—establish feelings with it, rely on it, and care about it. If one can have such a determination, one can be transformed and will not lose direction. At least one will not be unclear about major issues of right and wrong. But to get close to the Party and establish feelings with the Party, one must also smash the bourgeois inferiority of arrogance and self-importance. If this inferiority is not shed, then it is impossible to sincerely get close to the Party and establish feelings with the Party. In such a situation, to say that one wants to stand firm and transform oneself, I think it is all empty talk. Therefore, scientific workers must be humble in order to transform themselves.

    科学工作者必须虚心才能改造自己
    中国科学院实验生物研究所所长　贝时璋
    旧社会里科学工作者的生活，丝毫没有可留恋的地方。那时候，真的是“一团漆黑”；就在科学界中，投机取巧、玩弄手法、策划阴谋等等恶劣现象，无奇不有。只是那些甘心做坏事的人，才得意洋洋，恰好与当时社会环境相适应；而正直的科学工作者，则悲观失望，被欺侮、受凌辱，甚至于遭摧残。随着解放战争的胜利，乌云消散了，正气抬了头。应该说，科学工作者也从此翻了身。八年来共产党领导中国，使广大科学工作者和全国人民团结在一起，参加了社会主义建设，取得了巨大的成就；祖国的面貌有了根本上的改变。正如毛主席所说的那样：“我们的国家现在是空前统一的”；“祖国的更加美好的将来，正摆在我们的面前”。我们科学工作者，把新旧社会是做过对比的，而且早已辨别清楚，那个政党最大公无私，那种制度最民主，那条道路最有前途，那个政府最爱护人民和关怀科学。要共产党领导，走社会主义道路，不只是口号，而是广大科学工作者内心的愿望。我认为，今天在我们科学队伍中，如果还有人不愿走社会主义的道路，要走资本主义的道路，那是“大知识分子”的无知；今天在我们科学队伍中，如果还有人妄想篡夺科学工作的领导权，那是“蚍蜉撼大树，可笑不自量”；今天在我们科学队伍中如果还有人进行投机取巧，耍手法，搞阴谋等等，那在广大科学工作者面前必然被揭穿，必将要受到严正的批判。
    中国科学院郭沫若院长在全国人民代表大会第四次会议上发言，透彻地分析了并且有力地驳斥了由民盟中央“科学规划问题”临时研究组曾昭抡、钱伟长等五人所提出的“对于有关我国科学体制问题的几点意见”书，肯定了这个文件是一个彻头彻尾的反社会主义的科学纲领，隐藏着非常毒辣的反党、反人民的阴谋。从6月9日光明日报短评可以看出，这个阴谋是经过了充分策划的；这仅是一个开端，以后还有所为。这是一个政治上极大的罪行，引起了广大科学工作者无比的愤怒。而无产阶级究竟是“宰相肚里好撑船”，像曾昭抡、钱伟长那些反党、反人民、反社会主义的右派分子，实际上已经是无产阶级的敌人了。但是党把他们看做“迷路的羔羊”，想尽方法要把他们从泥坑中挽救出来，让他们痛改前非，重新走入社会主义改造的大门。只从这一点就可以认识清楚，共产党保护科学家真是无微不至。在中国科学院所召开的座谈会中，科学家们曾以极其沉痛的心情，对曾昭抡、钱伟长加以揭发和批判，以同志般的友爱对他们进行了帮助。会议五天，但曾昭抡、钱伟长始终无动于衷，没有忏悔的迹象。这使当时在座的科学家更加愤慨。
    我是一个无党派的科学工作者，政治水平很低。然而今天在我们科学界竟出现一个反社会主义的科学纲领，对我非常触目惊心。就这件事情，我们取得了经验教训，科学工作者对加强学习、改造自己是刻不容缓的。
    解放八年来，科学工作者在党的培养和教育下进行了学习，结合各种运动也改造了自己，但我们究竟是从旧社会过来的知识分子，较浓厚的资产阶级思想意识一时不容易肃清。在具体问题上，特别是在个人利益与集体利益有所矛盾的时候，资产阶级的思想根子就会复活起来，而且有可能发展下去。这次反右派斗争中，我们在科学界所见到的各种各样的右派类型，有的与右派思想起了共鸣，有的被右派分子利用了，有的与右派分子同流合污，有的当了右派的军师，有的甚至于成了右派中狂妄的野心家等等。我认为这都是资产阶级思想发展程度不同的表现。对于所有这些右派类型，只有一种救药，那就是赶快转变自己的立场，粉碎资产阶级的立场，树立无产阶级的立场。要树立无产阶级的立场，必须先靠拢无产阶级的核心力量——共产党，与它建立起感情，依靠它，关心它。如果能有这样的决心，就能得到改造，不会迷失方向，至少对大是大非不至于模糊不清。但是要靠拢党，与党建立起感情，还必须粉碎资产阶级自高自大的劣根性。如果这个劣根性不掉，那就不可能真心真意靠拢党，与党建立起感情。在这样的情况下，说是要站稳立场、改造自己，我认为都是空谈。因此，科学工作者必须要有虚心，才能改造自己。
