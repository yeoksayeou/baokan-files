    Suzhou Building Steel Plant
    The first phase of the Suzhou Steel Plant has recently begun construction and is expected to be completed by the end of the year.
    The Suzhou Steel Plant is a joint investment by the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, Shanghai Municipality, and Jiangsu Province. In the first phase of the project, a blast furnace will be built, capable of producing more than 36,000 tons of iron annually.
    The site of the Suzhou Steel Plant is located on Baizhi Mountain in Hushu Pass. This location is close to the Yangshan iron ore area, making the supply of iron ore relatively convenient.

    苏州兴建钢铁厂
    苏州钢铁厂第一期工程已经在最近动工，预计年底完成。
    苏州钢铁厂是石油工业部和上海市、江苏省联合投资兴建的。在第一期工程中将建立一座炼铁炉，每年可产生铁三万六千多吨。
    苏州钢铁厂厂址设在浒墅关的白豸山。这个地方靠近阳山铁矿区，铁矿石供应比较方便。
