　　Between Two Contradictions
　　By Our Correspondent Yu Yaofu
    Comrade Qi Tinghan, chairman of the trade union of Factory 53, recently came to Beijing to participate in the National Conference of Activist Representatives of Trade Unions. He has been working in trade unions since 1949 and has now become an outstanding grassroots trade union worker. One Sunday evening, I visited him and asked him to talk about his experiences in his work.

　  Four Investigations
    Comrade Qi Tinghan said that in order to bring into play the role of trade union organizations, it is necessary to correctly handle the relationship between the trade union and the administration, and the relationship between the trade union and the masses. From a general point of view, the trade union and the administration are inherently consistent, both for the purpose of improving production and both representing the fundamental interests of the masses. However, because the trade union and the administration handle problems from different angles and in different ways, when the trade union supports the reasonable demands of the masses, especially when the administration is unwilling to accept them, contradictions often form between the trade union and the administration. Sometimes, if the masses put forward excessive welfare demands, if handled improperly, it is also easy to form contradictions between the trade union and the masses.
    Qi Tinghan said that this is a major problem that every trade union cadre often encounters, and Factory 53 is no exception. He said that when the All-China Federation of Trade Unions proposed strengthening mass supervision in 1953, it was precisely the time when the situation of overtime work at Factory 53 was the most serious. Accidents and sick workers continued to increase, and the workers complained that the trade union and the administration did not take care of their health. At this time, in order to limit overtime work, the trade union sent special personnel to investigate the number of overtime hours and its proportion of the total task, reported to the Party committee, and suggested that the administration take measures. But it only lasted a few days, and the old problem relapsed. Trade union cadres generally complained that the administration did not implement the Party committee's resolutions, and their emotions were very agitated. Under this sentiment, the trade union conducted a second investigation, and suggested to the Party committee that the director and foreman of the Sixth Workshop, where overtime work was the most serious, be disciplined. The Party committee and the administration accepted the trade union's suggestion and convened a meeting of cadres above the level of foreman in the entire factory, announcing the disciplinary decision. But this only played a shock role for administrative cadres and still did not solve the problem. The contradiction between the trade union and the administration became more obvious. In order to restrain the administration from abusing overtime work, the trade union conducted a third investigation, and suggested that the administration announce the procedure for obtaining the trade union's consent to approve overtime work. The trade union argued with the administration every day, and the administration complained even more that trade union cadres lacked a production perspective.
    What to do? It was not until the fourth investigation that a way to overcome overtime work was found. This time, the trade union went deep into the Sixth Workshop to conduct an investigation, and found that the workshop director was full of grievances and cried. After analysis, it was learned that the main reasons for overtime work were: first, they were a tool workshop, and the whole factory was trial-producing new products, and there were too many modifications and changes in the drawings, resulting in rework and waste; second, the task requirements were too urgent, and several departments sent special personnel to urge them, sometimes unloading semi-finished products to do new work, changing several times a day, making production completely passive; third, the workers' morale was not high, and they demanded the implementation of piecework wages, saying:
  “The whole factory, even those washing gloves, have implemented piecework wages. Why don’t you implement it for us? This does not conform to the principle of distribution according to work.” The trade union reported this situation to the Party committee, and with the consent of the Party committee, new measures were taken: first, the administration strictly controlled the modification of drawings; second, the work plan was rearranged according to the urgency of the tasks; third, a competition for high-quality tools was launched in the workshop; fourth, saving tools was made one of the competition conditions in other workshops using tools. In this way, the tool workshop increased production efficiency by 20%, and the whole factory saved 15% of tools. Then, the piecework wage system was implemented. In this way, the production of this workshop was fundamentally changed, the phenomenon of overtime work was eliminated, and it was rated as an advanced workshop in the competition.
    He said that we have learned many lessons from this one problem. First, mass supervision must proceed from the desire for unity and start with help. It is impossible to solve the problem by simply using criticism, punishment, and restraint to force the administration to improve its work; second, the purpose of supervision is to help the administration complete production tasks and ensure the correct implementation of national policies and laws; if we simply start from protecting the interests of workers without solving the actual problems in production, we still cannot achieve the expected goals; third, do not abuse the means of supervision, we should take the initiative to think of ways, be good at adhering to principles, and help the administration solve problems with the greatest patience.

    The Dispute Over Work Clothes and Clothing Boxes
    Comrade Qi Tinghan talked about his experience in the trade union's connection with the masses. He said that connecting with the masses is the soul of trade union work. To connect with the masses, we must first understand the emotions of the masses, the demands of the masses, and treat the affairs of the masses as our own, and have an explanation for everything.
    Comrade Qi Tinghan said that we should first support the reasonable demands of the masses. Once, a workshop worker, Shang Shuqin, asked the foreman: "Why have all those who work about the same as me been promoted, but I haven't?" The foreman said: "The product quality is too poor." Shang Shuqin was not convinced and reported to the factory trade union, saying that the foreman was retaliating against her. In order to clarify the facts, the trade union sent special personnel to check Shang Shuqin's work record card, proving that her performance was not worse than that of the promoted workers. Only because Shang Shuqin had made suggestions to the foreman, the foreman took the opportunity to give her "a hard time." Although the foreman admitted his mistake in the face of the facts, he still couldn't get over it: "Let's talk about it next quarter!" The trade union considered it unreasonable and insisted on promoting Shang Shuqin.
    However, the demands of the masses are not necessarily completely reasonable, and the trade union should persuade the masses to give up unreasonable or temporarily unattainable demands. When the workers' congress was held this year, the most prominent opinion put forward by the representatives of various workshops was the request for the universal distribution of work clothes. There were two reasons: first, the entire factory had universally distributed them once in 1952, and there was a precedent to follow; second, it was heard that workers in other factories had work clothes. Even workers in the Seventh Workshop proposed: "We will petition if it is not resolved." This is a very difficult problem to solve. First, there are difficulties in the supply of cotton cloth in the country this year. The factory applied to the government for 60,000 feet of cloth, but only 20,000 feet were approved; second, the workers' demands are not completely reasonable. Therefore, it is necessary to persuade the masses. The trade union first explained the situation of cotton cloth supply to the workers' representatives. The representatives said: "We admit that the country has difficulties, and we can understand it, but why have other factories distributed work clothes? Don't they overcome difficulties?" In order to persuade the masses, the trade union selected nineteen representatives to go to three brother factories to understand the situation of distributing work clothes. As a result, the representatives found that workers in the same process who did not distribute work clothes in our factory did not distribute them in brother factories either. In this way, the representatives understood. At this time, the trade union held a representative forum. After discussion, it was decided: those who need it very much will be given, and those who do not need it very much will not be given, and the worn-out ones will be mended and used. Only then did everyone persuade.
    Qi Tinghan said that single workers who entered Factory 53 before 1952 were given a wooden box by the public to store clothes, but the single workers who came later did not have them, and they demanded a supplementary issue. In previous years, the trade union explained to the workers that because of the lack of wood, it could not be done. Single workers were very dissatisfied, saying that the trade union and the administration were wearing the same pants, and they would not solve the problem anyway. This year they raised this demand again. What to do? The trade union sent people to the single workers' dormitory to investigate and found that twelve people lived in one room, and they were bunk beds. It was really impossible to put them everywhere, and it would be more convenient to buy wicker bags or canvas boxes. So the trade union held a forum for single workers. After repeated discussions, everyone unanimously agreed to give up the request to make wooden boxes. The administration advanced funds to buy wicker bags or canvas boxes, and the employees would deduct the money from their wages in four months. At the same time, the trade union mobilized some single workers with better economic conditions who had wooden boxes to also buy wicker bags and give the wooden boxes to workers in need.
    Qi Tinghan also said that we should especially understand the suffering of the workers and be as patient as possible. We cannot act on impulse. A worker in the Sixth Workshop felt that the mutual aid savings society was not very helpful to him and asked to withdraw. The trade union advised him not to withdraw. He firmly said: "I will not borrow money from the mutual aid society after I withdraw." He withdrew from the association. But in the first half of this year, his child stayed in the hospital for more than two months, and it took two hundred yuan to pick him up from the hospital. Where to borrow money? Go to the trade union to borrow, he said he would not borrow money; if he didn't borrow, it would cost a few yuan more to stay in the hospital for another day. He went to the door of the workshop trade union five times and returned. Finally, there was really no way, so he had to bite the bullet and open his mouth to the trade union. But the workshop trade union was a bit emotional and said to him very impolitely: "You are no longer a member of the mutual aid society; you can borrow money, but you have to write a self-criticism first to admit your mistake." The money was still not borrowed. The next day, he found the factory trade union, and the factory trade union immediately helped him solve this difficulty. This worker was very moved. Qi Tinghan said that we often use these practical examples to educate trade union cadres and use practical actions to educate workers. The effect is much greater than talking about empty theories.

　　在两个矛盾之间
　　本报记者　余药夫
    五三工厂工会主席齐廷汉同志最近来北京参加全国工会积极分子代表会议。他从1949年起便做工会工作，现在已成为一位出色的基层工会工作者。在一个星期天晚上，我去访问他，请他讲一讲自己工作中的体会。
　  四次调查
    齐廷汉同志说，要想发挥工会组织的作用，必须正确处理工会与行政、工会与群众两方面的关系。从总的方面来看，工会和行政本来是一致的，都是为搞好生产，都是代表群众的根本利益的。但是，由于工会和行政处理问题的角度和方式不同，当工会支持群众的合理要求，而特别在行政不愿意接受的时候，往往形成工会与行政的矛盾。有些时候，群众提出过高的福利要求，如果处理不当，也容易形成工会与群众的矛盾。
    齐廷汉说，这是每一个工会干部经常碰到的大问题，五三工厂也不能例外。他说，1953年全国总工会提出加强群众监督的时候，正是五三工厂加班加点的情况最严重的时候。事故和病号不断增加，工人埋怨工会和行政不照顾他们的健康。这时，工会为了限制加班加点，派专人调查了加班加点时数和它在全部任务中所占的比重，向党委作了报告，建议行政采取措施。可是只好了几天，老毛病又重犯起来。工会干部普遍埋怨行政不执行党委决议，情绪非常激动。在这种情绪下，工会又作了第二次调查，向党委建议处分了加班加点最严重的六车间主任和工长。党委和行政又接受了工会的建议，召开了全厂工长以上的干部会议，宣布了处分决定。但这对行政干部仅仅起了震动作用，还是没有解决问题。工会和行政的矛盾更加明显了。工会为了约束行政滥行加班加点，又作了第三次调查，建议行政公布批准加班加点要取得工会同意的手续。工会天天同行政吵架，行政更加埋怨工会干部缺乏生产观点。
    怎么办呢？直到第四次调查才找到了克服加班加点的门路。这一次工会深入到六车间作了调查，发现车间主任满肚子委屈，哭了鼻子。经过分析，知道造成加班加点的原因主要是：第一，他们是工具车间，全厂正试制新产品，图纸修改变动太多，造成返工浪费；第二，任务要求过急，几个部门都派专人去催，有时把半成品卸下来又作新活，一天换好几次，使生产完全陷于被动状态；第三，工人情绪不高，要求实行计件工资，说：
  “全厂连洗手套的都实行了计件工资，为什么不给我们实行呢？这不符合按劳取酬的要求。”工会把这个情况向党委汇报，经党委同意采取了新的措施：第一，由行政严格控制图纸的修改；第二，根据任务的缓急重新安排了作业计划；第三，在车间开展了优等工具质量竞赛；第四，在其他使用工具的车间把节省工具作为竞赛条件之一。这样，工具车间提高了生产效率20％，全厂节约工具15％。接着，又开始实行了计件工资制度。这样，这个车间的生产就根本改变了，消灭了加班加点现象，并在竞赛中被评为先进车间。
    他说，我们从这一个问题上得到很多的教训。第一，群众监督必须要从团结的愿望出发，从帮助着手，单纯用批评、处分、约束的办法来强迫行政改进工作是不能解决问题的；第二，监督的目的是为了帮助行政完成生产任务，保证国家政策法令正确贯彻执行；如果单纯从保护工人利益出发，而没有解决生产中的实际问题，仍然达不到预期的目的；第三，不要乱用监督的手段，应该主动想办法，善于坚持原则，以最大的耐心帮助行政解决问题。
    工作服和衣箱的纠纷
    齐廷汉同志谈到他对工会联系群众的体会。他说，联系群众是工会工作的灵魂。要联系群众首先要了解群众的情绪，群众的要求，要把群众的事情当成自己的事情一样，件件都有个交代。
    齐廷汉同志说，我们应该首先支持群众的合理要求。有一次车间工人尚淑琴问工长：“为什么和我一起工作差不多的都升了级，单单我没升呢？”工长说：“产品质量太差。”尚淑琴不服气，又向厂工会反映，说工长对她报复。为了弄清事实，工会便派专人去检查尚淑琴的记工卡片，证明她的成绩比升级的工人的并不坏，只因为尚淑琴给工长提过意见，工长便乘机给她“小鞋穿”。工长在事实面前虽然承认了错误，但还转不过弯来：“说到下季度再说吧！”工会认为不合理，坚持给尚淑琴升了级。
    但是，群众提出的要求不见得完全合理，工会应该说服群众放弃不合理的或者暂时做不到的要求。今年开职工代表大会时，各车间代表提出的意见中，最突出的是要求普遍发工作服。理由有二，第一，1952年全厂普遍发过一次，有旧例可援；第二、听说其他厂工人都有工作服。甚至七车间还有工人提出：“不解决就请愿。”这是一个很难解决的问题。第一，今年国家棉布供应有困难，工厂向政府申请了六万尺布只批准两万尺；第二，工人要求并不完全合理。因此，必须说服群众。工会首先向工人代表说明棉布供应的情况。代表们说：“国家有困难，我们承认，也想得通，可是别的厂为什么都发了工作服，难道他们不克服困难吗？”工会为了说服群众，从代表中推选十九个人分头到三个兄弟厂去了解发工作服的情况。结果代表们发现，同样工序的工人，本厂不发工作服的，兄弟厂也没发。这样，代表们才想通了。这时工会又召开了代表座谈会，经过大家讨论，决定：十分需要的就发给，不十分需要的就不发，破旧的缝补使用。这才说服了大家。
    齐廷汉说，五三工厂在1952年以前入厂的单身工人都由公家发给一个盛衣服的木箱，可是后来的单身工人就没有了，他们要求补发。前几年工会向工人解释说，因为木料缺乏，不能做了。单身工人很不满意，说工会与行政穿一条裤子，反正不解决问题。今年他们又提出这个要求。怎么办呢？工会就派人到单身宿舍去调查，发现一个屋子住着十二个人，又是上下铺，真的每人发一个木箱子也没处放，改买柳条包或帆布箱，就方便多了。于是工会召开了单身工人座谈会，经反复商量，大家一致同意放弃做木箱的要求，由行政垫款买柳条包或帆布箱，款项由职工从工资中分四个月扣还。同时，工会又动员一部分经济条件好些的有木箱的单身工人也买柳条包，把木箱让给了有困难的工人。
    齐廷汉还说，对工人的疾苦要特别体谅，作到最大的耐心，不能凭意气用事。六车间有一个工人感到互助储金会对他帮助不大，要求退出。工会劝他不要退，他很坚决地说：“我退出后不会借互助会的钱”。他退会了。可是今年上半年他的孩子住了两个多月的医院，需要二百元才能接出医院。到什么地方去借钱呢？到工会去借吧，他说过不借钱的话了；不去借吧，多住一天医院就多几元的开支。他到车间工会门口去了五次又返回去了。最后，实在没有办法，才硬着头皮去向工会开口。可是车间工会有些义气，对他很不客气地说：“你不是互助会员了；借钱可以，你要先写检讨承认错误”。钱还是借不到。第二天他找到了厂工会，厂工会马上帮助他解决了这个困难。这个工人非常感动。齐廷汉说，我们经常拿这些实际例子教育工会干部，用实际行动教育工人，效果比讲空洞的大道理大得多。（附图片）
