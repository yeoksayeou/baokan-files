    Wang Zhixiang and Lao Junzhan Say the Problem is Quite Serious
    Many Organizations are Controlled by Rightists
    (Our newspaper's dispatch) At the second session of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Congress on August 1, Wang Zhixiang and Lao Junzhan, deputy chairmen of the Beijing branch of the Jiusan Society, delivered a joint speech stating that in addition to particularly egregious rightist backbone elements such as Chu Anping and Gu Zhizhong, the Jiusan Society had also exposed many rightists in its central, local, and grassroots organizations. Some local organizations, such as the Lanzhou branch, and grassroots organizations, such as the Lanzhou University branch, the Shandong University branch, and the Beijing Normal College group, have been controlled by rightists and have become tools for opposing the Party and opposing socialism. In the Beijing branch, according to statistics from only twenty-six grassroots organizations, there are more than forty rightists and more than twenty people with rightist remarks.

    After listing some of the anti-communist and anti-socialist activities of some rightists in the Jiusan Society in their speech, they said: "It should be affirmed that the problem of the Jiusan Society is quite serious. At the beginning of the anti-rightist struggle, the assessment of some leaders of our society that the problem of the Jiusan Society was not big was wrong."

    王之相、劳君展说问题相当严重
    不少组织被右派分子控制
    本报讯　九三学社北京市分社副主任委员王之相、劳君展8月1日在北京市第二届人民代表大会第二次会议上发表联合发言说，九三学社除了有储安平、顾执中这样特别恶劣的右派骨干分子以外，在社的中央、地方和基层组织里，也都暴露了不少右派分子。有的地方组织如兰州分社，基层组织如兰州大学支社、山东大学支社、北京师范学院小组等，在右派分子控制下，已成为反党反社会主义的工具。北京市分社方面，仅据二十六个基层组织的统计就有四十多个右派分子，有右派言论的二十多个。
    他们在发言中列举了九三学社中一些右派分子反共反社会主义的情况以后说：“应该肯定，九三学社的问题是相当严重的，在反右派斗争开始的时候，我社一些领导人认为九三学社的问题不大的估计是错误的。”
