　　Ministry of Agriculture Notifies All Areas to Rationally Organize Manpower and Animal Power
　　Improve Autumn Harvest Quality　Strive for Bumper Harvests
　　And Proposes Autumn Planting's Primary Goal: Timely Sowing and Improved Sowing Quality

　　(This newspaper dispatch) As the season for autumn harvest and autumn planting approaches, in order to strive for bumper harvests, timely autumn planting, and to ensure that both rectification and production are not neglected, the Ministry of Agriculture has issued a notice on doing a good job in autumn harvest and autumn planting.

　　The notice calls on all regions to strengthen organizational leadership of autumn harvesting, make plans and arrangements for labor and animal power (where labor and animal power are insufficient, they can consult with local troops, schools, and government agencies to provide support in terms of manpower and animal power as much as possible), to ensure timely harvesting and not delay autumn planting. For grain crops, harvest one plot as soon as it ripens, achieving careful harvesting and thorough threshing, returning every grain to the household. For rice, vigorously promote threshing machines to improve harvesting efficiency. Indica rice is prone to shattering, so attention should be paid to light cutting and gentle handling, harvesting and threshing as it is harvested, and in case of rain, efforts should be made to thresh it cleanly and dry it to prevent germination, mold, rot, and loss. Sweet potatoes should be harvested in a timely manner, and various local methods to prevent spoilage and loss should be promoted. Cotton should be picked as it opens, with careful and meticulous picking, especially separating and harvesting, ginning, storing, drying, and selling rotten flowers and frost-damaged flowers from good flowers, and paying attention to harvesting all the late flowers. Peanuts should be harvested before the frost, with careful harvesting and meticulous picking, ensuring everything is picked up.

　　What should be paid attention to during autumn planting this year? The notice says: In autumn planting, attention should be paid to the rational arrangement of various winter crops such as wheat, rapeseed, barley, broad beans and peas, and green manure, as well as land for spring planting next year. It is necessary to ensure the completion of the state's grain, cotton, and oil production plans, and it is also necessary to meet the needs of farmers' planting habits and crop rotation, so as to achieve the goals of cultivating soil fertility and increasing production throughout the year. Last year, due to the expansion of the multiple cropping index, the proportion of late crops increased, and harvesting was delayed, which often affected land preparation and moisture conservation, resulting in rough farming and untimely sowing. This is one of the important reasons for the reduced summer harvest in some areas this year. Therefore, timely sowing and improving the quality of sowing must be taken as the primary goals of autumn planting this year, and special efforts must be made to improve the quality of land preparation and sowing for late-season wheat and rapeseed. In the drylands of the north, autumn harvesting and autumn planting must be closely integrated, so that one plot is harvested, one plot is tilled, and plowing is followed by harrowing. In the paddy fields of the south, it is necessary to grasp the timing, take advantage of the moderate moisture of the soil, and immediately deep-plow and finely harrow, and build deep ditches and high ridges to facilitate drainage. Disaster areas should speed up drainage and strive to plant winter wheat in a timely manner. Agricultural cooperatives in various regions should establish green manure seed plots, and plan to expand the planting area of green manure and improve the quality of sowing. Winter fallow land should also be deep-plowed in autumn and winter in a timely manner.

　　The notice also points out: Autumn is a crucial season for collecting livestock feed and feeding livestock well. Moreover, the livestock feed needed this winter and next spring will mainly rely on preparations made during the autumn harvest. Therefore, during the autumn harvest, attention should be paid to increasing the amount of straw harvested, and all that can be used as livestock feed should be collected, and a large amount of wild grass should be stored. Livestock and veterinary stations and agricultural technology extension stations in various regions should teach agricultural cooperatives how to make silage feed. During the autumn harvest and autumn planting, animal power is very strained, so attention must be paid to the rational use and maintenance of draught animals.

　　Regarding autumn harvest and autumn planting in disaster areas, the notice points out: While doing a good job in disaster relief, first of all, all the crops that can be harvested should be harvested completely to prevent further losses. Waterlogged areas should organize forces to quickly drain the water and strive to sow in time. The seeds needed in disaster areas should mainly be resolved through local procurement and nearby adjustments, but they should be inspected and selected. If the disaster situation is serious and cannot be resolved, it should be reported to the higher authorities for allocation and support as soon as possible, and delivered to the agricultural cooperatives in a timely manner before sowing. Drought-stricken areas should take all drought-resistant measures and sow in time. If the drought situation is serious and sowing is impossible, consideration should be given to changing to other late-sown crops. At the same time, the prevention and control of livestock diseases in disaster areas should be strengthened to prevent livestock from being lost, starved to death, or dying from disease.

　　The notice puts forward some methods for solving problems such as fertilizer, seeds, and funds: It is necessary to ensure that pigs have pens, and help agricultural cooperatives formulate reasonable manure accumulation rewards to increase the enthusiasm of commune members to increase fertilizer, and make every effort to increase the amount of base fertilizer applied during autumn planting, and promote the use of furrow fertilizer and ditch fertilizer to concentrate fertilization and improve fertilizer efficiency. Mixing ammonium sulfate with wheat and applying quick-acting nitrogen fertilizer with phosphate fertilizer and farmyard manure as base fertilizer for rapeseed is economically effective in increasing production and should be vigorously promoted. This year, seeds for autumn planting in various regions should be inspected once before autumn, and methods such as winnowing and screening should be promoted to improve seed quality. Excellent varieties of wheat and rapeseed should continue to be expanded and promoted, but several corresponding varieties should be promoted according to different conditions, changing the past practice of single varieties in some areas, in order to adjust the rotation of labor and prevent accidental losses. In the autumn harvest distribution, production investment for the coming year should be reserved according to overall planning, to prepare for further expansion of reproduction.

　　农业部通知各地合理组织人力畜力
　　提高秋收质量　力争丰产丰收
　　并提出秋种首要目标——适时播种和提高播种质量
    本报讯　秋收秋种的季节即将来到。为了争取丰产丰收、适时秋种，并做到整风、生产两不误，农业部发出了关于做好秋收秋种工作的通知。
    通知号召各地加强对秋收工作的组织领导，做好劳力、畜力规划和安排（劳力、畜力不足的地方，可以商请当地的部队、学校、机关尽可能在人力、畜力方面给以支援），保证及时收割，不误秋种，对谷类作物，要熟一块，收一块，做到细收净打，颗粒还家。水稻要大力推广打谷机，以提高收获效率。籼稻容易落粒，应注意轻割轻放，随收随打，遇雨要设法打净弄干，防止发芽霉烂损失。甘薯要适时收获，提倡各种适合当地的防止腐烂损失的办法。棉花应随开随收，精细收摘，特别是烂花、霜后花要与好花分收、分轧、分存、分晒、分卖，并注意收净尾花。花生应当在霜前收获，精收细?，收净拾净。
    今年在秋种当中应当注意些什么呢？通知中说：在秋种中，要注意小麦、油菜、大麦、蚕豌豆及绿肥等各种冬作物及来年春地的合理安排，既要保证完成国家粮食、棉花、油料生产计划，又必须根据群众种植习惯和轮作需要，达到培养地力、全年增产的要求。去年由于扩大了复种指数，晚茬比重增加，收获迟，常常影响整地保墒，造成耕种粗放，播种失时，这是今年若干地区夏收减产重要原因之一。因此，必须把适时播种和提高播种质量作为今年秋种首要目标，特别要努力提高晚茬小麦及油菜的整地播种质量。在北方旱地，必须把秋收和秋种工作密切结合起来，做到收一块，耕一块，随耕随耙。南方水田，必须掌握火候，趁土壤干湿适度，随即深耕细耙，并要筑好深沟高畦，以利排水。水灾地区，应当加紧排水，争取适时多种冬麦。各地农业社应当建立绿肥留种地，有计划地扩大绿肥种植面积，提高播种质量。对冬闲田，也应在秋冬及时进行深耕。
    通知中还指出：秋季是收集牲畜饲料，喂好牲畜的关键性季节。而且今冬明春牲畜所需饲草饲料，主要依靠秋收中做好准备。因此，在秋收时，应当注意提高秸秆的收获量，凡能充作饲草饲料的都收集起来，并且大量收储野草。各地畜牧兽医工作站和农业技术推广站应当向农业社传授制作青贮饲料的方法。秋收秋种期间畜力很感紧张，必须注意耕畜的合理使役和保养。
    关于灾区秋收秋种工作，通知中指出：在做好灾民救济工作的同时，首先把一切能够收获的庄稼全部收获下来，不让再受损失。水灾区要组织力量迅速排除积水，争取及时播种。灾区所需种子，主要是以就地筹措，就近调剂的办法加以解决，但要加以检验和选择。灾情严重无法解决的，要及早提请上级调拨支援，并且要在播种前及时交到农业社。旱灾地区要求采取一切抗旱措施，及时下种。旱情严重无法下种的，应考虑改种其他晚播的作物。同时，还应加强灾区牲畜疫病防治，防止牲畜散失、饿死、病死等情况发生。
    通知中提出了解决肥料、种子、资金等问题的一些办法：切实做到猪有圈，并要帮助农业社制定合理的积肥报酬，提高社员增肥积极性，尽一切努力增加秋种底肥施用量，并且提倡用耧粪沟粪等办法，集中施肥，提高肥效。小麦硫安混播，油菜用速效氮肥配合磷肥及厩肥作底肥，增产经济有效，应当大力推广。今年各地秋种种子，应在秋前检查一次，并提倡用风选、筛选等办法，提高种子质量。小麦、油菜的优良品种，应继续扩大推广，但要根据不同条件，推广相应的几个品种，改变过去有些地区品种单一化的作法，以调节茬口劳力，并防止意外损失。在秋收分配当中，应当根据统筹兼顾，预留下年的生产投资，为进一步扩大再生产作好准备。
