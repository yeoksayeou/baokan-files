The Third Set of Radio Calisthenics to be Introduced Soon

(Our Dispatch) The third set of radio calisthenics, compiled by the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, will meet the broad masses in September.

With the improvement of our people's sports technical level and the enhancement of physical fitness, the first and second sets of radio calisthenics can no longer meet the needs of mass sports activities. Therefore, the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission invited Chinese gymnastics experts, martial arts experts, musicians, and teachers from various sports academies, middle schools, and primary schools to jointly study and compile the third set of radio calisthenics.

The third set of radio calisthenics is divided into adult, youth, and children's versions. It far surpasses the level of the first and second sets in terms of exercise volume, difficulty, and artistry. Its movements are novel, and the connections between sections are extremely smooth, with a richer sense of rhythm. Therefore, it is easy, natural, graceful, and generous to do. Its accompaniment music is written by famous Chinese musicians Li Huanzhi and Liu Chi, the composer of "Battle on Shangganling," and others, with beautiful melodies.

A major feature of the third set of radio calisthenics is that it incorporates several movements from Chinese national forms of sports (such as martial arts), making it an art with a strong national style.

This set of radio calisthenics has been tested in the Qinghe Woolen Mill in Beijing, the Nuan Shui Factory in Beijing, and some middle and primary schools, and has been warmly welcomed by workers, staff, and students. The State Physical Culture and Sports Commission is now stepping up photography and charting, and it is expected to meet the masses next month. (Shi Yuzhong)

    第三套广播体操即将推行
    本报讯　中央体育运动委员会编制的第三套广播体操，9月份即将与广大群众见面。
    随着我国人民运动技术水平的提高与体质的增强，第一、二套广播体操已经不能满足群众性体育运动的需要了。因此中央体育运动委员会邀请了我国的体操专家、武术专家、音乐家以及各体育学院、中小学的教员共同研究编制了第三套广播体操。
    第三套广播体操分为成人、少年和儿童三种。它在运动量、难度和艺术等方面都远远超过了第一、二套的水平。它的动作新颖，节与节之间的联接极为圆滑，更富有浓厚的韵律感，因此做起来轻松自然，优美大方。它的配曲是我国著名音乐家李焕之和“上甘岭”作曲者刘炽等同志编写的，旋律优美。
    第三套广播体操还有一个很大的特点，就是它吸取了我国民族形式体育运动（如武术）的若干动作，是一项具有浓厚民族风格的艺术。
    这套广播体操曾经在北京市清河制呢厂、北京市暖水厂工厂以及部分中、小学进行过试验，受到了工人、职工与学生的热烈欢迎。现在中央体育运动委员会正在加紧进行摄影制图，预计下月份即与群众见面。                                      （施毓忠）
