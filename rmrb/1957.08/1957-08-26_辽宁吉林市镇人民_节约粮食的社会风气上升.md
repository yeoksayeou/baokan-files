Cities Can Achieve a Lot in Saving Food

    Liaoning and Jilin Municipal and Township People
　　Social Atmosphere of Saving Food Rises

    (Our report) Since Liaoning Province tightened the food supply in cities and towns in December of last year, the social atmosphere of saving food has risen. With the total urban food supply in January as 100, it dropped to 84.9 in June; the average supply per person decreased from 30 jin and 9 liang before the rectification to 29 jin, 3 liang and 3 qian. In Fushun, housewives often compare which residential group saves the most food at the end of the month and study methods of saving food together. From February to July this year, the city saved a total of 1,899,000 jin of food. In Benxi City, there are nearly 300 collective food units. Since February, they have saved an average of more than 50,000 jin of food per month. This is because collective food units have generally established meal systems to plug loopholes in food management.
    Currently, some cities have not done a good job in saving food, and some food units are still using various methods to purchase more food from the state.
    The reasons for the waste of food are not only that some people do not have a sufficient understanding of the significance of saving food, but also that the cadres of the food supply departments are too lenient in controlling the supply, and lack serious investigation of the supplementary grain, resulting in a situation where "every request is supplemented." From this, it can be seen that the potential for saving food in cities is still very large.
    (Our report) Food sales in various cities and towns in Jilin Province have decreased significantly. According to statistics from 41 cities and counties and the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, after rectifying the unified purchase and sales work, unreasonable sales were reduced by more than 3,460 tons, of which 861 tons were saved by residents, an average of more than half a jin of food saved per person per month.
    Due to verifying the population and overcoming false reporting and fraudulent claims, a lot of food has been saved. According to statistics from 20 cities and counties, after verifying the population, the food supply for more than 27,300 people was reduced, and monthly food sales were reduced by more than 400 tons; in collective food units in government agencies and enterprises, a food budget and final accounting system was established, changing the unreasonable situation in the past where only the budget was reported, but the monthly food balance was not reported. In addition, the scope of food consumption in the catering industry has also been reduced, the actual food consumption plan has been reviewed, and the shortcomings of issuing grain coupons in unlimited quantities in the past have been changed.

### 辽宁吉林市镇人民　节约粮食的社会风气上升

　　城市节约粮食大有可为
    辽宁吉林市镇人民
　　节约粮食的社会风气上升
    本报讯　辽宁省自去年12月紧缩市镇粮食供应以来，社会节约粮食风气上升。城市粮食总供应量以1月份为100，6月份则降为84.9；每人平均供应量由整顿前的三十斤零九两降低到二十九斤三两三钱。在抚顺，家庭主妇们经常在月末比较哪个居民组节约粮食最多，互相研究节约粮食的办法。全城从今年2月到7月，共节约粮食一百八十九万九千多斤。本溪市有近三百个集体伙食单位，2月份以来，平均每月节约粮食五万多斤，这是因为各集体伙食单位普遍建立了就餐制度，堵塞粮食管理方面的漏洞。
    目前，有的城市节约粮食的工作还没有做好，有些伙食单位，仍旧利用各种办法向国家多购粮食。
    浪费粮食的原因，除了部分群众对节约粮食的意义认识不足外，粮食供应部门的干部对供应掌握偏宽，对补助粮缺乏认真调查，结果形成了“有叫必补”。从此看出，城市节约粮食的潜力还是很大的。
    本报讯　吉林省各城镇粮食销量已显著下降。据四十一个市县和延边朝鲜族自治州的统计，整顿统销工作以后压缩不合理的销量达三千四百六十多吨，其中居民节约的口粮就有八百六十一吨，按人口平均每人每月节约半斤多粮食。
    由于查实人口，克服虚报冒领，节约了不少粮食。据二十个市县的统计，查实人口以后，减少了二万七千三百多人的粮食供应，每月少销粮食四百多吨；在机关企业集体伙食单位，建立用粮预决算制度，改变了过去只报预算，不报月末粮食结余的不合理状况。此外还压缩了饮食业用粮的幅度，审查实际用粮计划，并且改变过去无限量的发放粮票的缺点。　（汤宝顺）
