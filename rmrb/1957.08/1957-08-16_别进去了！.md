    "Don't Go In!"
    Fang Wanshan
    Workers of the Huajian Company in Qingshan District, Baotou City, mostly live in temporary housing. The structure of these houses is relatively simple, with some roofs only plastered with two layers of mud. When it rained, leaks were common, which once caused dissatisfaction among the workers.
    One night, it was raining heavily, and some workers said: "The leaders really don't understand our suffering. After working all day, we can't even rest well at night."
    Some workers said: "I think the houses where the manager and Party Secretary live probably don't leak."
    Some said: "Let's go find the manager!"
    So, several workers braved the rain and walked towards the manager's dormitory. Before they even entered the door, they saw the manager through the window, busy rolling up his bedding, preparing to move his bed. Seeing this situation, the workers' anger was already half dissipated.
      "Let's not go in, look! The manager's room is also leaking."
      "Maybe the Party Secretary's house is better, let's go see."
    They walked to the door of the Party Secretary, and saw that the Secretary was also moving luggage. They didn't go in either, and returned. It turned out that the houses where the manager, the Secretary, and the workers lived were no different. If they can endure hardship, why can't we? From then on, the workers no longer complained about the leaders, and decided to overcome the difficulties themselves. In less than ten days, the workers themselves plastered a layer of blue-gray mud on the roof, and the houses no longer leaked. (Attached picture)

    “别进去了！”
    房万山
    包头市青山区的华建公司工人，大都住在临时性房屋里。这些房屋的结构比较简单，有的屋顶只抹了两遍草泥。下雨的时候，普遍漏雨，因此曾一度引起工人的不满。
    有一天夜里，下着大雨，有的工人说：“领导真不了解咱们的疾苦，工作了一天，夜里还不能很好休息”。
    有的工人说：“我想经理、党委书记住的房子绝不会漏雨”。
    有的说：“咱们找经理去”！
    于是几个工人都冒着雨向经理宿舍走去。他们还没有进门，就从窗口看见经理忙着卷铺盖，准备着移床铺。见了这种情况，工人们的气已经消了一半。
      “咱们别进去了，你瞧！经理室也漏雨啊”。
      “也许党委书记的房子好一点吧，咱们去看看。”
    他们走到党委书记的门口，看见书记也正在搬行李。他们也不进去回来了。原来经理、书记和工人住的房子并没有两样，他们能吃苦，咱们为什么不能吃苦呢？从此，工人们不再埋怨领导了，并且决定自己动手克服困难。不到一旬的时间，工人们就自己在屋顶抹上一层青色的灰泥，屋也不漏雨了。（附图片）
