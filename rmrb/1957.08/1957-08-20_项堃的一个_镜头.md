On a night in November last year, the lights blazed in a beautiful hall in Shanghai, echoing with voices slandering the Party. The Shanghai "commander" of the Zhang-Luo alliance, Chen Renbing, "directed" the opening of the Shanghai Film Studio's fifth symposium.

Xiang Kun, who often played villainous roles on the screen, feigned a concerned attitude toward the Party and "took the stage." With a pained expression, he described a shocking incident of "Party cadres abusing actors." He said: "During the filming of 'The Struggle on the Lake,' the Party branch secretary and production director, Jiang Yusheng, forced us to jump into a stinking ditch filled with poisonous snakes and schistosomiasis. When the arc lights came on, frogs jumped around in front of our eyes, tadpoles swam in our underwear, the mud at the bottom was two and a half feet deep, and the water smelled terrible. There was a shot that required me to crawl in, and my nose and mouth were full of stinking mud. If a capitalist told me to act, I could refuse. But today, I can't refuse." Xiang Kun then shouted furiously: "If the leaders of the Shanghai Film Studio do not deal with Jiang Yusheng, I will go to court to sue him!"

This "shocking" incident, distorted and embellished by Xiang Kun to make it seem plausible, confused many people and poured fuel on the fire of Chen Renbing's symposium. Chen Renbing even took this "big bombshell" from Shanghai to Beijing to attack the Party wildly, becoming a pretext for right-wing elements to slander the poor relationship between the Party and the masses at the Shanghai Film Studio.

Now the truth has come to light. Let's look at a "scene" of the director of "The Struggle on the Lake" and Xiang Kun confronting each other:

Director: The health authorities have certified that the river water does not contain schistosomiasis. Didn't you know that?
Xiang Kun: I knew it.
Director: Were the snakes poisonous?
Xiang Kun: I added the word "poisonous."
Director: Was the river full of frogs? Tadpoles swimming in your underwear?
Xiang Kun: I exaggerated.
Director: Was the river water really smelly? Did people wash rice and vegetables in it?
Xiang Kun: People were washing vegetables, I exaggerated.

People also cited facts such as the leaders specifically laying wooden boards on the muddy river bottom and providing protective equipment for the actors to go into the water, exposing Xiang Kun's lies from many aspects.

    项堃的一个“镜头”
    去年11月的一个夜晚，上海一个漂亮的大厅里灯火辉煌，回荡着污蔑党的声音。章罗联盟驻沪“主将”陈仁炳“导演”的上影五次座谈会开场了。
    在银幕上经常饰演反派角色的项堃佯装一副关怀党的面孔“粉墨登场”，他带着沉痛的神情，描述了一件“党员干部摧残演员”的惊人事件。他说：“在拍摄影片‘湖上的斗争’的时候，党支部书记、制片主任江雨声，强迫我们跳进有毒蛇有血吸虫的臭水沟里，水银灯一亮，青蛙在眼前乱跳，蝌蚪在裤衩里游来游去，水底污泥有二尺半，河水臭不可闻，有个镜头叫我钻进去，鼻子嘴里都是臭泥，资本家叫我演我可以不演，今天不演就不行。”项堃又怒不可遏地叫嚣：“如果上影领导对江雨声不予处理，我要到法院去控告！”
    被项堃歪曲渲染得若有其事的这一“惊人”事件，迷糊了许多人，给陈仁炳放火的座谈会泼了一桶油。陈仁炳更拿着这颗“大炮弹”，从上海到北京大肆向党进攻，成了右派分子污蔑上影党群关系恶劣的口实。
    现在真相已经大白。请看“湖上的斗争”的导演和项堃当面对质的一场“戏”：
    导演：河水经过卫生机关证明没有血吸虫，你难道不知道吗？
    项堃：知道的。
    导演：蛇是有毒的吗？
    项堃：“毒”字是我加的。
    导演：河里尽是青蛙？蝌蚪在裤衩里游来游去吗？
    项堃：是我夸大。
    导演：河水真的臭吗？有没有人淘米洗菜？
    项堃：是有人在洗菜，我夸大。
    人们还举出领导特地在河底污泥上铺了木板，为演员下水备有防护器具等事实。从多方面揭穿项堃的谎言。　　　　　　（新华社专稿）
