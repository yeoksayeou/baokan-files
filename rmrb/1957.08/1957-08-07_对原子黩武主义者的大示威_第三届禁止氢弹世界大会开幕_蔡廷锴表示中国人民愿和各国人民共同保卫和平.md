Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 6th August: The Third World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament opened in Tokyo this morning.

This World Conference will hold international preparatory meetings from August 6th to 10th, and formal plenary sessions from August 12th to 16th.

The international preparatory meeting that began today is attended by seventy representatives from twenty-two countries and nine international organizations, as well as about one hundred Japanese representatives. The representativeness and scale of this conference are broader and more extensive than the previous two.

After William Morrow, Secretary-General of the International Preparatory Committee of the Conference, and Masaharu Hatanaka, Secretary-General of the Secretariat, delivered opening speeches and made reports respectively, the conference elected representatives from Australia, the United Kingdom, China, Egypt, India, Japan, Peru, the United States, and the Soviet Union, as well as representatives from three international organizations: the Women's International Democratic Federation, the World Trade Union Federation, and the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, to form the presidium of the conference. They took their seats amidst warm applause.

Saneyoshi Yamada, the representative of Japan and President of the Japan Academy, spoke at the conference. He expressed his belief that this conference will achieve significant results on the issue of banning nuclear weapons, which concerns all mankind. He hoped that an international agreement banning nuclear weapons could be concluded in the near future.

Cai Tingkai, head of the Chinese delegation, said in his speech that the Chinese people have always advocated peace, the banning of atomic and hydrogen bombs, and the realization of universal disarmament, and support the holding of the Third World Conference. He said that the Chinese people are willing to work together with the Japanese people and the people of all countries in the world to oppose wars of aggression and defend peace in Asia and the world, and never allow the Hiroshima and Nagasaki tragedies of twelve years ago to be repeated. He expressed that on the road to achieving this common goal of mankind, the Chinese people will always be faithful friends of the Japanese people and the peace-loving people of the world. Cai Tingkai also expressed his heartfelt sympathy and deep condolences to the Japanese atomic bomb victims on behalf of the Chinese people.

The U.S. representative, Jacob, condemned the "clean hydrogen bomb" claim promoted by the United States. He said this was using language to create deceptive cartoons. He pointed out that this conference is very important; the representatives participating in the conference should promote human peace through this conference.

British representative Reginald Reynolds said in his speech that opposition to atomic and nuclear bomb testing is growing in Britain, and he called on the delegates to unite more closely to defend peace.

The conference will continue this afternoon, with representatives from various countries reporting on the anti-nuclear weapons movement in their respective countries.

Joliot-Curie and Chinese Labor and Youth Organizations Send Telegrams of Congratulations

Xinhua News Agency, 6th August: Paris News: Frédéric Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council, wrote a letter yesterday congratulating the Third World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament.

In his letter published in Paris, Joliot-Curie pointed out that stopping nuclear weapons testing is an urgent matter. He said that this is not only because such tests threaten humanity with various diseases, but also because it is an important part of the atomic arms race, because such tests stimulate countries possessing nuclear weapons to manufacture and test more and more powerful nuclear weapons. These tests create and exacerbate distrust between countries, and in the eyes of the people of all countries, they symbolize the danger of using atomic and hydrogen bombs as the main weapons of aggression in war.

Xinhua News Agency, 6th August: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Asia-Australia Liaison Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions sent telegrams congratulating the opening of the Third World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament.

In its telegram, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions stated, "Chinese workers have always been concerned about and supported the struggle of the Japanese people, who have personally suffered from atomic and hydrogen bomb disasters, against atomic and hydrogen bombs and demanding disarmament. We are very excited to see that your just struggle is developing and growing stronger year by year; we believe that your conference of great significance will make a major contribution to the common struggle of the people of all countries in the world to demand the prohibition of nuclear weapons, oppose war, and defend peace."

In its telegram, the Asia-Australia Liaison Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions expressed its deep respect for the Japanese people's struggle against atomic and hydrogen bombs and demanding disarmament. The telegram stated, "Now, the call for banning atomic and hydrogen bombs and disarmament has crossed national borders and is rising higher and higher in every corner of the world. This call, this force, cannot be stopped by any force. Now this struggle has entered an important stage. We believe that holding the Third World Conference at this time is of far-reaching significance.

We workers in various Asian countries have great expectations for this conference, which embodies our vital demands, and we firmly believe that this conference will make a major contribution to the struggle to defend world peace."

Xinhua News Agency, 6th August: The All-China Youth Federation and the All-China Students' Federation today jointly sent a telegram to the Third World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament, congratulating the conference on behalf of Chinese youth and students.

The telegram said that the heroic struggle of the Japanese people to defend peace and demand the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bombs has won the widespread sympathy and support of all Chinese people and youth. We are watching with great excitement the tremendous efforts made by the broad masses of Japanese youth and students in this struggle. Please convey the deep condolences of Chinese youth and students to the Japanese people who have suffered from atomic weapons disasters. We wish the conference success!

    新华社东京6日电　第三届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会今天上午在东京开幕。
    这次世界大会将从8月6日到10日举行国际预备会议，从12日到16日举行正式全体大会。
    出席今天开始举行的国际预备会议的有二十二个国家和九个国际组织的代表七十人以及日本代表约一百人。这次大会的代表性和规模比前两次大会更加广泛和宏大。
    大会国际筹备中心的事务总长威廉·莫罗和事务局长畑中政春先后致开幕词和作了报告以后，大会选出了澳大利亚、英国、中国、埃及、印度、日本、秘鲁、美国和苏联等九个国家和国际民主妇女联合会、世界工会联合会、国际民主法律工作者协会三个国际组织的代表组成大会主席团，他们在热烈的掌声中就座。
    日本代表、日本学士院院长山田三良在大会上讲话。他表示相信，这次大会在它提出的禁止核武器这个关系着全人类的问题上将会得到重大的成就。他希望在最近期间将能够缔结禁止核武器的国际协定。
    中国代表团团长蔡廷锴在会上致词时说，中国人民一贯主张和平，主张禁止原子弹氢弹和实现普遍的裁减军备，并且支持第三届世界大会的召开。他说，中国人民愿意和日本人民及世界各国人民一道，为反对侵略战争、保卫亚洲与世界和平而共同努力，绝不让十二年前发生的广岛、长崎事件重演。他表示，在为了实现人类这一共同目标而努力的道路上，中国人民将永远是日本人民和世界爱好和平人民的忠实朋友。蔡廷锴还代表中国人民对日本的原子弹受害人表示衷心的同情和深切的慰问。
    美国代表捷柯在会上谴责了美国方面所宣传的“干净氢弹”的说法。他说，这是用语言来画欺人的漫画。他指出，这次大会非常重要；参加大会的代表应该通过这次大会促进人类的和平。
    英国代表勒吉纳尔德·雷诺兹在会上致词时说，反对原子核炸弹试验的情绪在英国正在增长，他号召与会代表更加团结起来，保卫和平。
