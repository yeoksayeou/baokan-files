According to a recent report in the Sichuan Daily, what is the scale of capital construction in Sichuan Province this year, and what construction projects are currently underway?

According to statistics from the Sichuan Provincial Planning Commission, the total investment in capital construction in Sichuan Province this year amounts to 547 million yuan. Compared with last year, although state investment has slightly decreased, the scale of capital construction projects and workload actually arranged, including funds raised by special districts, counties, and other sources, is close to last year's construction level.

Industrial construction still ranks first among all investments. As one of the key areas for inland industrial construction in the country, Sichuan Province is seeing the construction, expansion, and renovation of many important factories and mines under the central ministries of steel, electricity, machinery, chemicals, coal mines, and paper making. The Chengdu Thermal Power Plant, which began construction in January this year, has entered the full construction phase for its main plant building and coal, water, and oil systems. This largest high-temperature and high-pressure power project built by our country during the first Five-Year Plan period will have a power generation capacity approximately five times that of Chengdu's existing power generation capacity after its completion, which can ensure the needs of Chengdu's growing industrial electricity, industrial steam, and hot water. The Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory, our country's second modern precision machine tool manufacturing plant, which began construction in May last year, has a designed production capacity larger than the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory, which was built in 1954. This factory continues construction this year, and eleven major workshops have been put into production ahead of schedule. The Yibin 602 Paper Mill, which is currently being expanded, will become the largest newsprint mill in the Southwest after the completion of all projects.

In industrial capital construction investment, Sichuan Province has paid special attention to the development of small-scale local industries this year, based on the principle of combining large, medium, and small enterprises and spending less money for quick results. According to statistics, the capital construction investment in local industries in Sichuan Province this year has exceeded the actual workload completed last year, with 375 new construction, expansion, and renovation industrial projects, of which the investment in industries such as coal, iron, electricity, and national foreign trade materials accounts for the largest proportion. This year, Sichuan Province plans to build more than 50 iron smelting factories and mines to supply raw materials to the central iron and steel industry and other departments, and they have already started construction one after another. A small blast furnace newly built by the Dongyuan Iron Plant will have an annual iron output of 10,000 tons after completion. At the same time, Sichuan Province has also restored a large number of small coal kilns in various special districts and counties. The Yangou Coal Mine, organized by the Rongchang County masses for mining, has only invested more than 1,600 yuan and can now produce three tons of coal per day, greatly alleviating the local fuel supply shortage. This year, Sichuan Province's local coal mines plan to produce more than 5 million tons of coal, which is more than double the output of large central coal mines in Sichuan. In addition, Sichuan Province is organizing manpower in various places this year to mine a large amount of non-ferrous metals and foreign trade materials such as mica and asbestos.

This year's investment in civil construction is mainly used for the construction, expansion, and renovation of schools. As the number of junior high school enrollments this year has increased after the state plan was determined, the state has also correspondingly added 5.28 million yuan in school building capital construction costs, which together with the original planned investment amounts to more than 17 million yuan, an increase of nearly half compared with the actual completion number last year. It is understood that the construction projects of various schools generally started in the first half of the year, and most of the school buildings can be completed before the autumn semester begins.

Another part of the capital construction investment in civil construction is used for urban construction, building new hospitals, increasing hospital beds, and building staff dormitories.

　　四川省今年建设规模多大？
    本报讯　四川省今年基本建设的规模如何？现在在进行哪些建设？四川日报最近作了报道。
    据四川省计划委员会统计，今年四川省基本建设投资总额达五亿四千七百多万元，同去年比较，国家投资虽稍有减少，但是加上专区、县和其他方面的自筹建设资金，实际安排的基本建设项目和工作量，其规模接近于去年的建设水平。
    全部投资中工业建设仍占第一位。作为国家内地工业建设重点地区之一的四川省，今年中央各部所属钢铁、电力、机械、化工、煤矿和造纸等方面的许多重要厂矿都在进行新建、扩建和改建。今年1月份动工兴建的成都热电厂，主厂房和煤、水、油等三个系统都已进入全面施工阶段。这个我国在第一个五年计划期内建设的最大的高温高压的动力工程之一，在建成以后，它的发电量约等于成都现有发电量的五倍，可以保证成都地区日益发展的工业用电、工业用汽和热水的需要。去年5月动工兴建的我国第二座现代化的精密机械工具制造厂——成都量具刃具厂，它的设计生产能力比1954年建成的哈尔滨量具刃具厂还大。今年这个厂继续施工，现在已有十一个主要车间先后提前投入生产。目前正在扩建的宜宾六零二造纸厂，全部工程完工以后，将成为西南最大的新闻纸厂。
    在工业基本建设投资中，四川省今年根据大、中、小企业相结合的方针和少花钱、收效快的原则，特别注意发展小型地方工业。据统计，今年四川省地方工业的基本建设投资已超过了去年实际完成的工作量，新建、扩建和改建的工业工程达三百七十五项，其中以煤、铁、电力、国家对外贸易物资等工业的投资比重最大。今年四川省为供应中央钢铁工业和其它部门的原料，计划建设的五十多个冶铁工业厂矿，目前已陆续开工。东原铁厂新建的一座小高炉，建成以后，年产铁将达一万吨。同时，四川省还在各专区、县恢复了大批小煤窑，荣昌县组织群众开采的堰沟煤矿，仅投资一千六百多元，现在已能日产煤三吨，大大缓和了当地燃料供应的紧张情况。今年，四川省地方煤矿计划产煤五百多万吨，比中央在四川的大型煤矿产量多一倍。另外，四川省今年在各地组织人力，大量采掘有色金属和云母、石棉等对外贸易物资。
    民用建筑事业今年的投资主要是用来新建、扩建和改建学校。由于今年初中招生数字在国家计划确定后又有所增加，国家也相应地追加了五百二十八万元的校舍基本建设费用，连同原计划投资共达一千七百多万元，比去年实际完成数增加将近一半。据了解，各学校的建设工程一般都在上半年开工，绝大部分校舍都可以在秋季新生入学前完成。
    民用建筑基本建设投资的另一部分，是用于城市建设、新建医院，增加病床和职工宿舍等方面。
