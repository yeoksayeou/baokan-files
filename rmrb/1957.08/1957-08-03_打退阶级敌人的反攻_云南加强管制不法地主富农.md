    Repelling the Counterattack of Class Enemies
    Yunnan Strengthens Control over Illegal Landlords and Rich Peasants
    Kunming Dispatch: (This newspaper) August 2nd. While striving for a bumper harvest, the peasants of Yunnan Province are strengthening their struggle against illegal landlords, rich peasants, and remaining counter-revolutionary elements.
    At the same time as the bourgeois rightists were launching a frenzied attack on socialism, illegal landlords, rich peasants, and remaining counter-revolutionary elements in many rural areas of Yunnan seized the opportunity to carry out counter-settlements and to murder activists in the countryside. In the second and sixth districts of Malipo, there were eight cases of landlords and rich peasants settling accounts. Landlord Yu Shunyuan of Babao Township openly threatened the masses, saying, "If anyone calls me a landlord again, I will burn his house." Landlord Hu Lanfang of Luomian Township in Fumin County demanded that the peasants return the furniture that had been distributed during the land reform, saying, "You've used it for these years, it's time to return it to me!" Some landlords and rich peasants in Baishahe Township, Lijiang County, now refuse to acknowledge the class designations assigned to them during the land reform. According to an investigation in Huluchong Township, Huaning County, among the fifty-one landlord and rich peasant households in the entire township, there were seven households that engaged in counterattacks, settling accounts, and demanding the return of land, houses, and furniture from the peasants.
    During this period, many landlord and rich peasant elements spread rumors to incite the masses and engaged in sabotage and murder. Landlord and rich peasant elements in Ludian, Qiaojia, and other counties attempted to sabotage cooperatives and incite the masses not to work. In Aping Township, Longling County, landlord Jiang Mingwen secretly returned from Burma at the end of May and hacked the production team leader and two activists of the Aping Cooperative, and set fire to the houses of nine commune members. Jiang was shot and killed by us while trying to escape. In Tongba Township, Fourth District, Jinping County, reactionary landlord Liu Yongfu and rich peasant Wang Zheng’an organized an assassination group, secretly plotting to assassinate activists of our cooperatives, and have now all been arrested by us. Many landlord and rich peasant elements who had already had their class status changed have also recently been spreading rumors to incite the masses and sabotage production.
    At present, while striving for a bumper harvest, the peasants of Yunnan are strengthening control and struggle against landlord and rich peasant elements and saboteurs. Landlord and rich peasant elements whose class status has been changed but are now starting to engage in sabotage will have their landlord and rich peasant labels reapplied and be placed under strict control.

    打退阶级敌人的反攻
    云南加强管制不法地主富农
    本报昆明2日电　云南省农民在争取大丰收的同时，正加强对不法地主富农和残余反革命分子的斗争。
    在资产阶级右派分子向社会主义猖狂进攻的同时，云南农村中不少地方的不法地主、富农和残余反革命分子，乘机进行反攻倒算，凶杀农村中的积极分子。麻栗坡的二、六两区，发生地主富农倒算的有八起。八保乡地主余顺元公开威胁群众说，“那个再叫我地主，我就烧他的房子。”富民县罗免乡地主胡兰芳向农民索回土改时被分的家具，并说：“你们用了这几年，该还我啦！”丽江县白沙河乡有些地主富农，现在又不承认过去土改时划的成分。据华宁县葫芦冲乡的调查，全乡五十一户地主、富农分子，有反攻、倒算、向农民索回土地房屋、家具行为的就有七户。
    在这一阶段中，不少地主富农分子，造谣煽惑群众，并进行破坏凶杀活动。鲁甸、巧家等县的地主富农分子企图破坏合作社，煽动群众不出工。龙陵县阿坪乡地主蒋明文，5月底从缅甸潜回砍伤阿坪社的生产队队长和积极分子两人，纵火烧毁九家社员的房子。蒋犯在逃跑时被我击毙。金平县四区通坝乡反动地主刘永福和富农王正安组织暗杀集团，密谋暗杀我合作社的积极分子，现已全部被我逮捕。不少已经改变成分的地主富农分子，最近一个时期，也大肆造谣煽动群众，破坏生产。
    目前，云南农民在紧张争取大丰收的同时，正加强对地主富农分子和破坏分子的管制和斗争。对已改变成分而现在又开始破坏的地主富农分子，将重新戴上地主富农帽子加以严格管制。
