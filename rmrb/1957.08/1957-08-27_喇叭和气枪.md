　　Horns and Air Guns

    According to a United Press report on the 20th: The American "Embassy" in Taiwan wants Americans to avoid honking their car horns at Chinese people and to take air guns away from their children, in order to avoid anti-American sentiment.

    This wolf-in-sheep's-clothing tactic of the American "Embassy" in Taiwan is utterly despicable, and it won't fool even slightly sensible children. Taiwanese children will ask: Compared to the roar of American planes and the sound of car horns, which sound is louder and more annoying? Compared to American cannons and air guns, which is bigger and more hateful? May I ask, gentlemen of America, how will you answer? Does it mean that Chinese people oppose America simply because they dislike the sound of American car horns, while they happen to enjoy listening to the roar of American planes? Does it mean that Chinese people, who even detest Americans shooting air guns, would instead be interested in American cannons?

    Completely contrary to the deceptive propaganda of the American wolf in sheep's clothing, the reason why the people of Taiwan oppose America is because America has occupied China's territory of Taiwan, and because America is obstructing China's reunification. In simple terms, it is because America is a robber and an enemy of the Chinese people! The anti-American sentiment of the Taiwanese people is constantly rising, and the anti-American demonstration that took place in Taipei not long ago is a powerful proof. The fact that the Taiwanese people hate the sound of American car horns and the sight of American-made air guns further illustrates the extent to which the anti-American sentiment of the Taiwanese people has reached!

    China has a population of 600 million. Although the vast majority of people cannot hear the sound of American car horns or see Americans shooting air guns, they all have anti-American sentiments, which can very well explain the essence of the problem. Simply telling Americans who are invading Taiwan to not honk their car horns or shoot air guns will absolutely not deceive people. If the Chinese people are to have no anti-American sentiments, at the very least the American government must abandon its policy of aggression and make the American invading forces get out of China's territory of Taiwan.

　　喇叭和气枪
    据合众社20日说：美国驻台湾“大使馆”要美国人开汽车时不对中国人按喇叭，要美国人从他们孩子那里拿走气枪，以免引起反美情绪。
    美国驻台湾“大使馆”这种狼外婆的作法是十分可鄙的，这连稍稍懂事的孩子也骗不过去。台湾儿童会问：美国飞机的吼声和汽车喇叭声比较，哪一个声音更大更讨厌？美国大炮和气枪比较，哪一个更大更可恶？请问美国的先生们，你们将何以答对？难道中国人反对美国只是讨厌美国汽车的喇叭声，而偏偏喜欢听美国飞机的吼声吗？难道连美国人打气枪都厌恶的中国人，倒会对美国大炮感兴趣吗？
    和美国狼外婆的欺骗宣传完全相反，台湾人民所以反对美国，是因为美国侵占了中国的领土台湾，是因为美国阻碍中国的统一。简单说来，因为美国是强盗，是中国人民的敌人！台湾人民反对美国的情绪在不断高涨，不久以前在台北发生的反美大示威是有力的证明。台湾人民听到美国汽车的喇叭声、看到美制气枪都憎恨，更说明台湾人民的反美情绪达到了怎样的程度！
    中国有六亿人口。虽然绝大多数人听不到美国汽车的喇叭声，看不到美国人打气枪，但是他们都有反对美国的情绪，这就很可以说明问题的实质究竟是什么。光叫侵略台湾的美国人驾驶汽车不按喇叭和不打气枪，是绝对骗不了人的。要中国人没有反对美国的情绪，起码美国政府要放弃它的侵略政策，使美国的侵略军队从中国的领土台湾滚出去。　（裴达）
