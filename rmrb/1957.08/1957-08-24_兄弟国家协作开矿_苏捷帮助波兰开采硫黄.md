　　Fraternal Countries Collaborate in Mining
　　Soviet and Czechoslovak Assistance to Poland in Sulfur Extraction
    Warsaw Dispatch, August 22nd: Poland's largest natural resource, sulfur, will be exploited with joint investment from Poland, Czechoslovakia, and under the design of Soviet experts. This is stipulated in a recent resolution passed by the Polish Council of Ministers.

    Poland's sulfur deposits are extremely abundant, estimated to be the second or third largest in the world. The Polish government has approved the draft for the construction of a sulfur joint enterprise in Tarnobrzeg, which was drafted by Soviet experts and revised and supplemented by a Polish expert committee.

    According to the Soviet draft, an open-pit mine and a series of processing enterprises will be built in Tarnobrzeg. Since the sulfur is buried 40 to 60 meters underground, 25 million cubic meters of soil must be removed to construct the open-pit mine. Once completed, it will produce 250,000 tons of pure sulfur annually.

    In addition, the draft stipulates the construction of a series of processing enterprises, including a sulfuric acid plant with an annual output of 400,000 tons. It is worth noting that the sulfuric acid output of this factory is equivalent to the total annual output of sulfuric acid in Poland in 1955. Polish experts also pointed out that the production of sulfuric acid is now valued worldwide because it is necessary for obtaining uranium. In addition to the sulfuric acid plant, a large superphosphate factory, fluorine compound factory, phosphoric acid factory, and a series of other chemical plants will be built. According to the draft, partial sulfur production will begin next year, with an estimated annual output of 10,000 tons, increasing to 30,000 tons per year by 1960. According to long-term planning, the level of producing one million tons of pure sulfur annually will be reached by 1970. The economic effect of this construction is significant, and it is estimated that the country's entire investment can be recovered within four and a half years after the joint enterprise starts operation.

    On August 16, the Polish Council of Ministers passed a resolution to ensure the implementation of this decision regarding the joint enterprise and instructed the relevant departments to actively cooperate. According to newspaper reports, construction of this joint enterprise, covering an area of 1,800 hectares, has already begun, and an army of 5,000 workers will participate in the construction.

### 兄弟国家协作开矿　苏捷帮助波兰开采硫黄

　　兄弟国家协作开矿
　　苏捷帮助波兰开采硫黄
    本报华沙22日电　波兰最大的一种自然财富——硫黄矿将在波捷两国共同投资下、在苏联专家设计下进行开采。这是波兰部长会议最近通过的决议中规定的。
    波兰硫黄矿的蕴藏量极为丰富，据估计占世界第二位或第三位。波兰政府已经批准了在泰诺勃杰建设硫黄联合企业的草案，这个草案是由苏联专家起草并经过波兰专家委员会的修改和补充。
    根据苏联草案，在泰诺勃杰将建造露天开采矿和一系列加工企业。由于硫黄埋藏在四十到六十公尺深度的地下，因此为了建造露天矿必须挖去二千五百万立方公尺的土。全部建成后，每年可产净硫黄二十五万吨。
    此外，草案规定将修建一系列加工企业，其中包括年产量四十万吨硫酸的硫酸制造厂。值得指出的是这个工厂的硫酸产量相当于1955年波兰全国全年的产量。波兰专家并指出：现在全世界都重视硫酸生产，因为这是为取得铀所必需的。除硫酸制造厂外，将修建大型的过磷酸钙工厂、氟的化合物工厂、磷酸工厂等一系列化学工厂。根据草案，明年就将开始部分生产硫黄，估计年产量为一万吨，到1960年将增长到每年三万吨。根据远景规划，到1970年将达到每年生产一百万吨净硫黄的水平。这项建设的经济效果很大，估计在联合企业开工后四年半期间，国家的全部投资即可收回。
    8月16日，波兰部长会议通过了保证实现有关联合企业的这项决定，并责成各有关部门大力配合。据报纸消息，这个占地一千八百公顷的联合企业的建筑工程已经开始动工，参加这项建筑工程的将有一支由五千工人组成的大军。
