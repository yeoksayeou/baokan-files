　　Concretization of the Zhang-Luo Alliance's Reactionary Scientific Program Regarding Social Sciences
　　Fei Xiaotong and Others Plot the Restoration of Bourgeois Sociology
(Our Dispatch) The conspiracy activities of bourgeois rightists Fei Xiaotong, Wu Jingchao, Chen Da, Li Jinghan, and others to restore bourgeois sociology have been fully exposed.

The restoration of bourgeois sociology is an important step in realizing the anti-socialist scientific program of the Zhang-Luo Alliance. The reactionary plan for restoring bourgeois sociology proposed by Fei Xiaotong, Chen Da, and others on June 9th is a further concretization of the Zhang-Luo Alliance's anti-socialist scientific program regarding social sciences.

In order to achieve the goal of restoring bourgeois sociology, bourgeois rightists carried out various conspiracies and used all kinds of despicable methods.

As early as January this year, rightist Wu Jingchao published an article in "New Construction" entitled "Does Sociology Still Have a Place in New China?" This article was the first signal publicly issued by bourgeois rightists to carry out the restoration of old sociology. Then, on February 20th, Fei Xiaotong published an article in Wenhui Daily entitled "A Few Words About Sociology," echoing Wu Jingchao's article. This article put forward systematic opinions on the restoration of bourgeois sociology, from the so-called object of sociological research to specific personnel arrangements, all of which were planned. After this, Fei Xiaotong carried out a series of conspiracies. In addition to ordering his followers to carry out liaison activities everywhere, he publicly demanded a change in the attitude towards bourgeois social sciences at the Propaganda Work Conference convened by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on March 12th. On March 24th, his "Early Spring Weather of Intellectuals" was published. The article began by praising Chen Da and Li Jinghan, giving them great support. On April 10th, "New Construction" convened a symposium on sociological issues hosted by Fei Xiaotong. At the same time, Wu Jingchao, Chen Da, and others were also busy. On March 7th, Chen Da, Wu Jingchao, and others jointly submitted a proposal to the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to establish a research institution centered on population issues and to open population courses or set up population majors in universities. On April 16th, Wenhui Daily published a record of an interview with Chen Da, vigorously promoting Chen Da's proposal to restore bourgeois sociology.

During the period of Great Blooming and Great Contending, bourgeois rightists carried out conspiracies more actively. On April 23rd, the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences held a symposium, at which Fei Xiaotong, Wu Jingchao, Li Jinghan, and five others were designated to form a preparatory group to consider establishing a "Social Problems Research Working Committee" under the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences at an appropriate time. The rightists used this legal guise to carry out the act of switching the sky and changing the day. Under the urging of Fei Xiaotong, a meeting was held at Chen Da's home on the afternoon of June 9th. At this meeting, they arbitrarily changed the "Social Problems Research Working Committee" to the "Sociology Working Committee" and privately elected Chen Da as the chairman. They blatantly planned to collect "academic colleagues" in bourgeois sociology and planned to establish the "Chinese Sociological Society." They also wanted to establish sociology departments in universities in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and other places. They attempted to use the Central Institute for Nationalities, Renmin University of China, and the School for Labor Cadres as their bases of activity. The decisions made at this meeting were the specific action program for bourgeois rightists to plot the restoration of old sociology.

From the above activities, it seems that the political conspiracies of bourgeois rightists Fei Xiaotong and others, under the banner of "restoring" bourgeois sociology, to oppose the Communist Party, oppose socialism, and oppose Marxism, are prominently manifested in the following aspects:

First, viciously attacking the Communist Party and actively opposing socialism are the common characteristics of these rightists. For example, Chen Da was so hostile to the Communist Party that he "did not want to hear the name of the 'Party'." He openly asked the Communist Party to change the "Party" to "Alliance." Li Jinghan slandered the Communist Party for "holding Marxist-Leninist books in its left hand and Soviet weapons in its right hand to rule the people," and threatened the Communist Party with "water can carry a boat, but it can also capsize it." Fei Xiaotong and Wu Jingchao were even more the vanguards of the Zhang-Luo Alliance in opposing the Communist Party.

In order to oppose the socialist system, in addition to carrying out a series of evil activities to restore bourgeois sociology, they also used "social investigation" as a pretext to create and expand contradictions among the people and to instigate dissatisfaction among the people towards the Party. Fei Xiaotong himself admitted that "Revisiting Jiangcun," which he wrote during his inspection in Jiangsu, was "provoking the relationship between the peasants and the Party in front of the peasants." "This investigation is essentially a political activity." Li Jinghan's investigation in the rural areas of Beijing suburbs last year, which was praised by Chen Da as applying "the most typical sociological method," did his best to instigate and slander agricultural cooperation. He even spread rumors that "in the past, people were treated as cattle and horses… but today, people are treated as tractors." During May 1956, Pan Guangdan, under the guise of inspecting ethnic work and studying the problems of the Tujia ethnic group, conducted a twenty-day visit in the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture. During the visit, he colluded with individual Tujia intellectuals and carried out a series of activities to instigate ethnic relations.

Secondly, they attempt to replace Marxism with bourgeois sociology, making bourgeois sociology the guiding ideology of our country. To achieve this goal, they first attack Marxism. Fei Xiaotong openly accused Marxism, defended idealism, mobilized people to "sue" Marxists, and asked to clarify "why idealism is wrong." Wu Jingchao slandered Marxism-Leninism as "dogmatism," cursed that "it has already influenced many people's worldviews," and accused Marxist-Leninists of "superstition" of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, daring not to criticize their works, and daring not to overthrow these idols. Li Jinghan uglified learning Marxism-Leninism as "putting on a pair of glasses" for himself, and spread rumors that without these glasses, he would be thrown around by the leadership at will.

While attacking Marxism-Leninism, they also vigorously touted bourgeois sociology, saying that bourgeois sociology is the "science" that must be relied upon to solve contradictions among the people. Li Jinghan boasted that his social investigation could accurately reflect the true face of society, and that if their method was not adopted, it would "bring serious losses" to the government's work. Fei Xiaotong even exaggerated that "the question of 'restoring' bourgeois sociology" should be raised "from the needs of the current socialist transformation and socialist construction."

Thirdly, bourgeois rightists attempt to use the restoration of bourgeois sociology to open a path in universities and the scientific community to realize the Zhang-Luo Alliance's seizure of leadership in the cultural and educational circles. To this end, they attack the reorganization of departments and teaching reforms in universities on the one hand, and on the other hand, strive for a position for the restoration of bourgeois sociology in universities and the scientific community.

Fei Xiaotong, Pan Guangdan, Chen Da, and others have long been dissatisfied with the abolition of sociology departments in colleges and universities in 1952. At that time, Fei, Pan, and others planned to save the sociology department by dividing it into three parts: ethnic studies, statistics, and population, but this attempt was not realized. Some time ago, they thought that the day for reversing the verdict had come. In May, Chen Da and others wrote to the Ministry of Higher Education, questioning why labor majors were canceled; they also expressed their firm disagreement with the "root-and-branch" approach of abolishing sociology departments during the reorganization of departments. Wu Jingchao, Fei Xiaotong, and others also attacked the reorganization of departments.

In the program for the restoration of bourgeois sociology formulated on June 9th, the rightists made specific arrangements for institutions and personnel on their own. In addition to attempting to establish a "Sociology Working Committee," they also assigned Wu Wenzao, Pan Guangdan, and others to be responsible for drafting teaching plans for the establishment of sociology departments in universities. Wu Wenzao was also preparing to be the head of the department. They also conspired to use the Institute for Nationalities, Renmin University of China, and the School for Labor Cadres as bases for the activities of bourgeois sociology, planning for Fei Xiaotong to engage in ethnological research at the Institute for Nationalities and to hire more "sociologists" to compile world ethnographies; Li Jinghan and Wu Jingchao to engage in urban community surveys and research at Renmin University of China; and Chen Da to engage in population and labor surveys and research at the School for Labor Cadres. They also attempted to establish a social survey research institute at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and to select a county with a population of about 300,000 near Beijing as a laboratory for population surveys and research.

Fourth, bourgeois rightists, under the name of "restoring" bourgeois sociology, attempt to unite all those who are dissatisfied with the Party and recruit troops for the Zhang-Luo Alliance. On the one hand, Fei Xiaotong constantly shouted that there were problems with our attitude towards the old social sciences, which made the social science team "not connect the old and the new," viciously describing today's scientific team as "a few vanguards dragging behind them a large number of 'old people' who cannot play a role"; on the other hand, he vigorously touted bourgeois sociologists, saying that they "have a deeper understanding of society than those who have not been poisoned," "have more experience, more experience, and wider knowledge than those who have not gone through this struggle." And he patted his chest and said: "I am willing to recommend this group of people." In order to collect talent in bourgeois sociology, Chen Da opened a list of people engaged in sociology, including not only those in the country but also those abroad. In the specific action plan for the restoration of bourgeois sociology formulated on June 9th, it was not only proposed to establish a "Chinese Sociological Society" to "unite and connect with former colleagues in the sociological circles," but also to "train and cultivate young successors" on a large scale.

　　章罗联盟反动科学纲领关于社会科学部分的具体化
　　费孝通等图谋资产阶级社会学复辟
    本报讯　资产阶级右派分子费孝通、吴景超、陈达、李景汉等人所进行的复辟资产阶级社会学的阴谋活动，已全部暴露。
    复辟资产阶级社会学，是实现章罗联盟反社会主义科学纲领的一个重要步骤。费孝通、陈达等人在6月9日提出的复辟资产阶级社会学的反动计划，是章罗联盟反社会主义科学纲领关于社会科学部分的进一步具体化。
    为达到复辟资产阶级社会学的目的，资产阶级右派分子进行了多种多样的阴谋活动，使用了各种卑劣的手法。
    早在今年1月，右派分子吴景超就在“新建设”发表了“社会学在新中国还有地位吗？”一文。这篇文章是资产阶级右派公开发出的进行旧社会学复辟活动的第一个信号。接着，2月20日，费孝通在文汇报发表“关于社会学，说几句话”一文，和吴景超的文章互相呼应。在这篇文章里，提出了关于资产阶级社会学复辟的系统的意见，从他们所谓社会学研究的对象到具体的人事安排，都作了策划。在此以后，费孝通就进行了一连串的阴谋活动。他除了命令他的喽啰们到处进行串联活动以外，3月12日在中共中央召开的宣传工作会议上，公开提出要求改变对资产阶级社会科学的态度。3月24日，他的“知识分子的早春天气”发表，文章一开头就抬出陈达、李景汉，对他们大事捧场。4月10日，“新建设”召开了由费孝通主持的社会学问题座谈会。与此同时，吴景超、陈达等也忙碌起来。3月7日，陈达、吴景超等联名向政协全国委员会提出成立以人口问题为中心的调查研究机构及在高等学校开设人口课程或设置人口专业的提案。4月16日，文汇报发表了陈达访问记，大事鼓吹陈达恢复资产阶级社会学的主张。
    在大鸣大放期间，资产阶级右派分子更积极的进行阴谋活动。4月23日，科学院哲学社会科学学部召开了一个座谈会，会上推定费孝通、吴景超、李景汉等八人组成一个筹备小组，酝酿在适当时期，在哲学社会科学学部下设立一个“社会问题研究工作委员会”，右派分子就利用这个合法的外衣，进行偷天换日的勾当。在费孝通的督促下，6月9日下午在陈达家里召开了一次会议。在这次会议上，他们擅自篡改“社会问题研究工作委员会”为“社会学工作委员会”，并私自推选陈达为主任委员。他们明目张胆的计划搜罗资产阶级社会学的“学界同人”，打算成立“中国社会学会”。他们还要在北京、上海、广州、成都等地的高等学校里成立社会学系。他们妄图以中央民族学院、人民大学和劳动干部学校作为他们活动的基地。在这次会上作出的决定，是资产阶级右派分子图谋旧社会学复辟的具体行动纲领。
    从上述这些活动看来，资产阶级右派分子费孝通等人，在“恢复”资产阶级社会学的叫嚣下，进行的反对共产党、反对社会主义和反对马克思主义的政治阴谋，突出的表现在以下几个方面：
    首先，恶毒地攻击共产党，积极地反对社会主义，是这些右派分子的共同特点。例如陈达对共产党竟仇视到“不愿听‘党’的名字”的程度，他公然要共产党把“党”改成“盟”。李景汉污蔑共产党“左手拿着马列主义书本，右手拿着苏联武器，统治人民”，并用“水能载舟亦能复舟”来威胁共产党。费孝通、吴景超，更是章罗联盟反对共产党的急先锋。
    为着反对社会主义制度，他们除了进行一连串的资产阶级社会学复辟的罪恶活动外，还假借“社会调查”，来制造和扩大人民内部的矛盾，挑拨人民群众对党的不满。费孝通自己承认在江苏视察期间所写的“重访江村”，是“在农民面前挑拨他们和党的关系。”“这次调查实质上是一种政治活动。”李景汉去年在北京郊区农村所作的被陈达誉为应用“最典型的社会学的方法”的调查，就对农业合作化极尽挑拨污蔑的能事，他甚至造谣说，“过去把人当牛马……而今天却把人当拖拉机用”。潘光旦在1956年5月间，打着视察民族工作，研究土家民族问题的招牌，在湘西苗族自治州进行了二十天的访问。在访问中他和个别土家族知识分子串通一气，进行了一系列的挑拨民族关系的活动。
    其次，他们企图以资产阶级社会学来代替马克思主义，使资产阶级社会学成为我们国家的指导思想。为达到此目的，他们首先攻击马克思主义。费孝通公然控诉马克思主义，替唯心论申冤，动员人们和马克思主义者“打官司”，要问明白“唯心论为什么不对”。吴景超污蔑马克思列宁主义为“教条主义”，咒骂“他已经影响许多人的世界观”，责备马克思列宁主义者“迷信”马、恩、列、斯，不敢批判他们的著作，不敢打倒这几个偶像。李景汉则将学习马列主义丑化成是为自己“配上一付眼镜”，并造谣说没有这付眼镜就会被领导上随便地把他抛来掷去。
    在攻击马克思列宁主义的同时，他们又极力吹嘘资产阶级社会学，把资产阶级社会学，说成是解决人民内部矛盾所必须依靠的“科学”。李景汉吹嘘他的社会调查能精密准确地反映出社会真实面貌，如果不采用他们的方法，就会给政府工作“带来严重的损失”。费孝通更夸张成“要从当前社会主义改造和社会主义建设的需要上”来提出“恢复”资产阶级社会学的问题。
    第三，资产阶级右派分子企图利用恢复资产阶级社会学，在高等学校和科学界为实现章罗联盟夺取文教界领导权打开一条门路。为此他们一面攻击高等学校的院系调整和教学改革，一面又在高等学校和科学界为资产阶级社会学复辟争取地位。
    费孝通、潘光旦、陈达等人对1952年高等学院停设社会学系，早已心怀不满。当时费、潘等人打算把社会学系分成民族、统计和人口三部分保存下来，这个企图没有实现。前些时候，他们认为翻案的日子已经到来。5月间，陈达等就写信给高教部，责问为何取消劳动专业；又表示坚决不同意院系调整时取消社会学系这种“连根拔除的办法”。吴景超、费孝通等人也攻击院系调整。
    在6月9日所制定的资产阶级社会学复辟的纲领中，右派分子就对机构和人事妄自作了具体的安排。除企图成立“社会学工作委员会”外，他们还推吴文藻、潘光旦等负责草拟在高等学校设立社会学系的教学计划。吴文藻还准备做系主任。他们还阴谋以民族学院、人民大学和劳动干校作为资产阶级社会学的活动的基地，计划由费孝通在民族学院搞民族学研究，添聘“社会学家”编写世界民族志；李景汉、吴景超在人民大学搞城市社区调查研究；陈达在劳动干校搞人口与劳动调查研究。他们还企图在科学院成立社会调查研究所，在北京附近选择三十万左右人口的一个县作人口调查研究的实验室。
    第四，资产阶级右派分子在“恢复”资产阶级社会学的名义下，企图纠合一切对党不满的人，为章罗联盟招兵买马。费孝通一方面不断叫喊，说我们对待旧社会科学态度有问题，使得社会科学队伍“新旧不接”，恶毒地把今天科学队伍形容为“少数先锋队背后拖着一大批发挥不了作用的‘旧人物’”；另方面他又极力为资产阶级社会学者吹嘘说，他们比“没有受过毒的人”“对社会认识得更深刻，比没有经过这番斗争的人经验多，阅历深，见识广”。而且拍着胸膛说：“我愿意保举这一批人员。”为了搜罗资产阶级社会学的人才，陈达曾开了一个搞社会学的人的名单，其中不但有在国内的，而且有在国外的。在6月9日制订的资产阶级社会学复辟的具体行动计划中，不但提出要成立“中国社会学会”，“团结与联系原来社会学界同人”，而且要大规模地“训练培养年轻的接班人”。
