Racing Ahead of Time, Racing Ahead of the Flood

　　Heilongjiang's 400,000-Strong Flood Control Army Battles the Flood
　　Central Flood Control Headquarters Actively Supports with Large Quantities of Materials Rushed from All Regions

　　(Reported by this newspaper) Water levels in major rivers in Heilongjiang Province continue to rise, and the situation is extremely urgent. The province already has nearly 400,000 flood control soldiers, battling day and night on the dikes. Under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, the people are, with firm confidence, braving wind and rain to carry out the project of raising and thickening the dikes.

　　The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Committee have convened several emergency meetings, mobilizing the people of the province to adopt a fighting posture, concentrate all manpower and material resources, race ahead of time, race ahead of the flood, ensure the safety of Harbin and the riverside cities and villages, and ensure a bumper harvest of farmland and the smooth progress of various construction undertakings. The meetings made specific arrangements for accelerating the progress of flood control projects, ensuring project quality, and strengthening the political and ideological work and material supply of flood control teams.

　　Ouyang Qin, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, and other Party and government leaders of the province and city inspected the dikes in the rain. Wang Yilun, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, Zhao Qufei, Deputy Governor, and some department and bureau heads went to Zhaoyuan and other places to direct the battle in person.

　　The upcoming flood peak of the Songhua River will exceed the highest water level of 1956 (120.06 meters) by 34 centimeters. This year's flood is late, but it is rising fiercely. Due to the fierce water of the Songhua River, many dangerous sections have appeared on the more than 300-li-long dam in Zhaoyuan County, and some places have experienced dike breaches. In Yilan County, due to the rapid rise of the Mudanjiang River flood, five townships, forty-four villages, and more than 6,500 hectares of land were flooded. Because of the timely rescue, no one was injured or killed. There are also several dangerous sections on the Songpu District Dike in Harbin City, which were rescued by the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Harbin and cadres and workers of various agencies, and the situation was turned from danger to safety.

　　In order to overcome the flood, the government has mobilized a large number of materials from various places to support the Songhua River flood control struggle. More than 2.8 million grass bags, more than 100,000 wooden poles, and more than 60,000 jin of grain allocated by the Central Flood Control Headquarters from Beijing, Tianjin, Dalian, Shenyang, and other places are being rushed to various places along the Songhua River in Heilongjiang Province. The entire people of Heilongjiang Province are actively supporting the river embankment project on the one hand, and trying every means to rescue crops in the waterlogged areas on the other.

　　抢到时间前面　抢到洪水前面
　　黑龙江四十万防汛大军和洪水战斗
    中央防汛指挥部正从各地赶调大批物资积极支援
    本报讯　黑龙江省各主要江河水位继续上涨，情况十分紧急。全省已有近四十万防汛大军，日夜战斗在堤坝上。在各级党委领导下，人民正以坚定的信心，冒着风雨，进行加高培厚堤坝工程。
    中共黑龙江省委和省人民委员会已召开多次紧急会议，动员全省人民以战斗的姿态，集中一切人力物力，抢到时间前面，抢到洪水前面，确保哈尔滨和沿江城乡的安全，确保农田丰收和各项建设事业的顺利进行。会议对加快防洪工程进度、保证工程质量，加强防汛队伍的政治思想和物资供应工作都做了具体安排。
    省委第一书记欧阳钦和省、市其它党、政负责人，冒雨视察堤防。省委书记王一伦、副省长赵去非和部分部、厅长，亲赴肇源等地指挥战斗。
    松花江即将到来的洪峰水位将超过1956年最高水位（一百二十点零六公尺）三十四公分。今年洪水来得虽晚，却涨得凶猛。由于松花江水势凶猛，肇源县三百多里长的大坝，已出现险工多处，有的地方已发生溃堤现象。依兰县因牡丹江洪水急涨，有五个乡、四十四个屯、六千五百多公顷土地被淹。因为抢救及时，未伤亡一人。哈尔滨市松浦区大堤也有数处险工，经人民解放军驻哈部队和各机关干部、工人等冒雨抢修，始转危为安。
    为战胜洪水，政府从各地调动了大批物资，支援松花江防汛斗争。中央防汛指挥部从北京、天津、大连、沈阳等地调拨的二百八十多万条草袋、十多万根木杆和六万多斤粮食，正在向黑龙江省沿江各地火急运送。黑龙江省全体人民正一面积极支援江堤工程，一面在内涝地区，想尽办法，抢救庄稼。　（记者站）
