    Customer Queuing Time Reduced
    —Tianjin Third Commercial Bureau System Improvement Work Achieves Results
    By Our Correspondent Zhong Lin
    The Tianjin Third Commercial Bureau, which manages companies and many stores in the food, non-staple food, and catering industries, has implemented the spirit of "rectifying while improving," actively taking measures to improve service quality and shorten the time customers spend queuing to buy goods, winning praise from the general public.
    Not long ago, in Tianjin, to buy pork, white sugar, or sesame cakes... the queuing time was very long. Sometimes people waited in line for a long time and still couldn't buy anything, which made the masses very dissatisfied.
    How can we shorten the queuing time for customers? The relevant departments of the Tianjin Third Commercial Bureau organized special personnel and, in May, after investigation and research, first identified the objective and subjective reasons for the long queues:
    From an objective point of view, the most fundamental problem is that the growth rate of the production of certain commodities cannot keep up with the increasing needs of consumers, and the constant changes in purchasing power have further increased the pressure on the supply of food and non-staple foods. For example, after the opening of the guided free markets, a large number of farmers coming to the city to do business needed to buy food; after the cloth ration coupons were halved in the second half of the year, many people invested the money they originally used to buy cloth in food and non-staple foods. Therefore, the phenomenon of insufficient supply of these commodities became serious, and the queuing time for customers increased accordingly. Under these circumstances, some residents, seeing that certain commodities were scarce, would queue up to buy them even if they were not urgently needed.
    From the subjective aspect of commercial work, some commercial staff have a reluctance to sell, believing that selling goods should be a "long and steady flow," fearing that "selling out the goods will damage the image of the store." Therefore, when selling goods, they intentionally stall for time, not daring to bring the goods they have to the counter, or insisting that buying different things must be done in separate queues... This increases the number of times customers queue up and prolongs the time. Some commercial units not only fail to change their supply plans in a timely manner based on market demand but also retain goods at each level, which also exacerbates the crowding of customers queuing up. Retail units not arranging business hours and manpower according to business conditions, and improper sales methods, are also reasons for excessively long queues.
    Now that the reasons have been found, there are also ways to improve the work. After more than a month of practice, the following methods have been proven effective in several units:
    Close contact between production and sales, finding substitute commodities, organizing and expanding sources of goods, and truthfully explaining the commodity supply situation to consumers are important links for commercial departments to alleviate queuing congestion. Taking the Heping District Vegetable, Food, and Grocery Branch Company as an example, their supply of fresh eggs was insufficient. Through the old relationship of a purchasing agent with a dried fruit store, they obtained a steady supply of fresh eggs from the countryside. At the same time, they also increased the supply of duck eggs and goose eggs, basically overcoming the out-of-stock situation of egg products and the congestion of customers queuing up. When the supply of white sugar and brown sugar was insufficient, they purchased honey and red dates as substitutes and truthfully explained the situation to customers, asking them to use honey and dates instead of sugar.
    Criticizing and overcoming the reluctance of some commercial staff to sell, further establishing the idea of convenience for customers, and advocating preparing before selling can also shorten the queuing time for customers. Some small butcher shops in Nankai District cut the meat into "portions" in advance, such as "one dime," "two dimes," "three dimes"... and display them separately on the meat counter, selling them very quickly.
    In order to shorten the queuing time for customers, it is also necessary to change business hours and adjust labor organization in a timely manner according to the specific situation. The Changchun Road Vegetable Market sells seven or eight pigs a day. Previously, there were only two counters selling meat, and the queue for buying meat in the morning often exceeded one hundred people. Now, two more counters have been added, and special personnel have been assigned to collect money, so the number of customers queuing up at most does not exceed twenty.
    Based on the principle of convenience for customers, many improvements have also been made to sales methods. A catering outlet in Chengxiang District changed the method of "shared sales, customers pick up themselves" to "buy a ticket to be seated, serve food according to the ticket." The Heping District Catering General Store adopted methods such as "expanding the outlet, increasing seats," "separating wholesale and retail," and "reducing regular meals and increasing breakfast." The Pastry Company educated salespersons to tell the truth to customers and adopted a "fixed time, fixed number of times, fixed quantity" supply. These improvements have greatly shortened the queuing time for customers.
    Many stores have also strengthened their ties with residents, frequently visiting consumers to solicit opinions; regularly inviting residents to hold forums, reporting to residents on the situation of the supply of goods, and actively seeking the supervision, understanding, and support of residents, which has also achieved good results.
    Many units under the Tianjin Third Commercial Bureau have already achieved many successes in improving service quality. However, the comrades in the bureau believe that many of the measures for improvement still lack detailed evaluation, and many specific problems in grassroots units have not yet been specifically resolved according to time and local conditions. There is also not enough research on new problems that may arise in the improvement work. Therefore, how to further deepen the work still requires continuous and unremitting efforts.

### 顾客排队的时间缩短了——天津市第三商业局系统改进工作有成绩

    顾客排队的时间缩短了
    ——天津市第三商业局系统改进工作有成绩
    本报记者　钟林
    天津市第三商业局管理食品、副食品和饮食等行业的公司和许多商店，贯彻“边整风、边改进”的精神，积极采取措施提高服务质量，缩短了顾客排队买货的时间，得到广大消费者的好评。
    不久以前，在天津市要想买点猪肉、白糖或烧饼……，排队的时间非常长，有时站了好久的队，还买不到东西，群众很不满意。
    怎样才能缩短顾客排队的时间呢？天津市第三商业局各有关方面组织专人，在5月间，经过调查研究，首先找出造成顾客排队太长的主客观原因：
    从客观方面来看，最根本的问题是某些商品的产量的增长速度，赶不上消费者日益增长的需要，而购买力不断发生的变化，对食品和副食品的供应更加重了压力。如有领导的自由市场开放后，大量进城作买卖的农民要在城里买东西吃；下半年布票对折使用后，许多人把原来买布的钱投向食品和副食品，因此这些商品供应不足的现象严重起来，顾客排队的时间也相应地增长了。在这种情况下，有些居民看见某些商品缺少，他们虽然并不迫切需要，也去排队购买。
  　从商业工作的主观方面来看，有些商业工作人员有惜售思想，他们认为卖东西要“细水长流”，怕“东西卖光了有损门面”。于是，他们售货的时候有意慢腾腾地磨时间，本来有的货也不敢拿到柜上来，或者硬要规定买不同的东西必须分别排队，……这都使顾客排队次数加多，时间延长。有些商业单位不仅不根据市场需求情况，及时改变自己的供应计划，反而层层扣留货物，这也加重了顾客排队的拥挤现象。零售单位不根据业务情况安排营业时间和人力，售货方法不妥当，也是造成排队过长的原因。
    原因找出来了，改进工作的办法也有了。经过一个多月的实践，下面几种办法是在若干单位行之有效的：
    密切产销之间的联系，寻找代用商品，组织和扩大货源，实事求是地向消费者说明商品供应的情况，是商业部门缓和排队拥挤现象的重要一环。以和平区蔬菜食品杂货分公司为例，他们的鲜蛋货源不足，经采购员通过一家干鲜果店的老关系，从农村源源取得了鲜鸡蛋的供应，同时还增加了鸭蛋、鹅蛋，基本上克服了蛋类商品脱销和顾客排队拥挤的现象。白糖和红糖供应不足的时候，他们就购进蜂蜜和红枣来代替，并且实事求是地向顾客说明情况，请顾客以蜜和枣代糖。
    批判和克服某些商业工作人员的惜售思想，进一步树立便利顾客的思想，提倡售货前作好准备，也可以缩短顾客排队的时间。南开区的一些小肉铺，事先把肉切成“份肉”，有“一角的”、“二角的”、“三角的”……，分别陈列在肉案上，卖起来很快。
    为了缩短顾客排队的时间，还需要根据具体情况及时变更营业时间和调整劳动组织。长春道菜市场每天要卖七、八头大猪，从前只有两个案子卖肉，早上排队买肉的队伍常常超过一百人。现在增加了两个案子，还另配备专人收款，排队的顾客最多可以不超过二十人了。
    从便利顾客的原则出发，售货方法也作了许多改进。城厢区一个饮食业门市部，把“分摊售货、顾客自取”的办法，改为“买牌入座，看牌送货”，和平区饮食总店采取了“扩大门市部，增加座位”，“批发和零售分开”，“压缩正餐、增加早点”等办法；糕点公司教育售货员要对顾客说实话，并且采取“定时、定次、定量”供应。这些改进办法都大大缩短了顾客排队的时间。
    许多商店还加强了和居民的联系，经常访问消费者，征求意见；订期邀请居民开座谈会，向居民报告货源和供应工作的情况，主动地争取居民的监督、谅解和支持，也收到很好的效果。
    天津市第三商业局所属的许多单位，在改进服务质量方面已经取得了不少成绩。但是，局里的同志们认为，许多改进工作的措施还缺乏细致的鉴定，基层单位的许多具体问题也还没有因时因地制宜地加以具体解决，对改进工作中可能出现的新问题研究得还很不够，因此，如何进一步深入工作，还需要继续不懈地努力。
