    The Silver Swallows of Youth
    Shi Yuzhong
    On August 17th, patches of white clouds floated in the blue sky. Over the fields outside Changxindian, flocks of "silver swallows" soared. The National Aviation Model Competition, Beijing Competition Area aviation model performance, was being held here.

    A silver model airplane rose into the sky, launched by a running youth. When it reached a height of about fifty or sixty meters, the youth deftly rotated his hand, and the iron hook pulling the airplane immediately detached. This unmanned, second-level towline model airplane then freely sailed through the clouds, flying in the long sky like a happy swallow.

    This excellent young performer is a member of the aviation model group at the Beijing Youth Science and Technology Center. His name is Wang Xiaohuai, and he is fifteen years old this year. Since childhood, he has enjoyed being friends with bamboo dragonflies and small airplanes. During the National Day celebration in 1953, when he represented the children of Beijing in presenting flowers to Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao kindly asked him, "What do you want to be when you grow up?" He pointed to the majestic air force uncles passing through Tiananmen Square and said, "I want to fly airplanes when I grow up." Chairman Mao encouraged him, and he was very happy. Through diligent study, he has finally acquired excellent skills.

    A burst of thunderous engine noise told people: the stunt performance was about to begin. An iron "swallow" with a golden body and silver wings flashed past in front of people and overhead with lightning speed. Under the control of Wu Shaochun, a student from the Xi'an Aviation Institute, it changed endlessly, sometimes flying high into the sky, sometimes rapidly turning and diving downwards, flying low to the ground, sometimes rolling in the air, and sometimes flying forward upside down with its belly facing the ground. The sound of the engine grew louder, and two cable-controlled "eagles" appeared overhead. They sometimes chased each other one after the other, sometimes flew wing to wing, and sometimes flew at different heights, like fish enjoying themselves in the water, playing in the deep abyss, arousing the unanimous praise of the audience.

    Another large towline model airplane rose, flying so smoothly and freely after detaching, as serenely as a lark circling in the air, attracting even a distant eagle to come and accompany it. The performer was national athlete Xue Minxian. Last year, his airplane soared in the skies of Budapest, Hungary, where he won third place in the international competition, earning honor for his country. Now that this "flying eagle" is launched in his own country, how could it not fly happily?

    The sun was setting, but our small airplanes were still flying, and groups of people were still looking up to watch. Yes, beneath them stand many enthusiasts of aviation, and perhaps one day they will become flying generals, speeding through the skies of the motherland, guarding the great motherland.

    Aviation, what an attractive heartstring. Since ancient times, people have fantasized about flying into the sky and exploring the secrets of the universe. Today, under the care and guidance of the Party, thousands upon thousands of young people will be able to realize such wishes.

    青少年们的银燕
    施毓忠
    8月17日，蓝空中飘浮着片片的白云。长辛店郊外的原野上空，翱翔着成群的“银燕”。这里正在进行全国航空模型比赛，北京竞赛区的航空模型表演。
    一架银色的模型飞机，随着一个奔跑的少年向天空升起。当它升到约五、六十公尺高度的时候，只见少年的手灵活地转动了一下，牵引着飞机的铁钩立即脱落，这架无人驾驶的二级牵引模型飞机，便自由自在地划拨着云彩，像一只愉快的燕子飞翔在长空。
    这个优秀的少年表演者，是北京少年科学技术馆航空模型小组的成员，名叫王小怀，今年十五岁，自幼就欢喜和竹蜻蜓、小飞机在一起做朋友。1953年国庆节，他代表北京市少年儿童向毛主席献花时，毛主席曾亲切地问他：“长大了要做什么？”他指着经过天安门的雄壮的空军叔叔说，“我长大了要驾驶飞机”。毛主席鼓励了他，他很高兴。由于积极钻研，现在他终于学得了良好的技术。
    一阵雷轰的马达在告诉人们：特技表演开始了。一只金身银翼的铁“燕”，以风驰电闪的速度，在人们的面前、头顶闪掠而过。它在西安航空学院吴少椿同学的操纵下，变化无穷，忽而高高地上飞，忽而急速回转向下俯冲，低低地贴着地面飞行，忽又在空中翻滚，忽又肚子朝天背向地面倒卧着前进。马达的声音更大了，人们的头顶出现了两只线操纵的“飞鹰”。它们有时一前一后相互追逐，有时比翼双飞，有时则一高一低，活像鱼儿得水，嬉弄深渊，引起了观众的同声赞美。
    另一架大型的牵引模型飞机升起来了，它在脱钩后，飞得那么平稳和自在，安详得好像一只云雀在空中盘旋，惹得远处的老鹰也凑过来与它作伴。作表演的是国家选手薛民献，去年他的飞机曾翱翔在匈牙利的布达佩斯的天空，在那里的国际比赛中，他为祖国争得了第三名的荣誉。现在由他放起的这只“飞鹰”在自己的国土上，怎能不愉快地飞翔呢？
    夕阳西下了，我们的小飞机还在飞翔，成群的人还在昂首观看。是啊，在它们的下面，正在站着多少个航空事业的爱好者，说不定有一天，他们成为飞将军，奔驰在祖国的高空，守卫着伟大的祖国。
    航空，多么吸引人的心弦。自古以来，人们就幻想飞向天空，窥探宇宙的秘密。今天在党的关怀和教导之下，成千上万的青少年都将能够实现这样的心愿。
