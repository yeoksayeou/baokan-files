Xinhua News Agency, August 15th. Korean Democratic People's Republic Ambassador to China, Li Yongho, held a grand reception in Beijing tonight to celebrate the 12th anniversary of the liberation of Korea.

Vice Chairman Zhu De and more than a thousand Chinese and foreign guests attended the reception.

Vice Chairman Zhu De spoke at the meeting, extending warm congratulations to the government of the Korean Democratic People's Republic and the Korean people on behalf of the Chinese government and people.

He praised the brilliant achievements made by the Korean people in the past twelve years in resisting imperialist aggression, striving for the independence and peaceful reunification of their motherland, and creating a happy and prosperous life, and the outstanding contributions they have made to easing international tensions.

Vice Chairman Zhu De said: The Korean Democratic People's Republic has consistently adhered to the rational proposition of peacefully resolving the Korean issue and has made unremitting efforts to maintain the effective implementation of the armistice agreement. On the contrary, the United States and the South Korean authorities have violated the will of the Korean people and have consistently obstructed the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Recently, the U.S. side has even violated the Korean Armistice Agreement by transporting new weapons into South Korea, which is a serious provocation by the United States against the Korean Democratic People's Republic and the Korean people, as well as all peace-loving countries and people. The Chinese people strongly condemn the illegal act of the United States in undermining the Korean Armistice Agreement, antagonizing the Korean people, and escalating tensions in Korea and the Far East. We firmly support the rational proposal of the government of the Korean Democratic People's Republic to convene an international conference with the broad participation of relevant countries.

Vice Chairman Zhu De said that the Chinese people are satisfied to see that the friendship and unity between Korea and China, and between Korea and various socialist countries, are being consolidated and developed day by day. We firmly believe that the great unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union will further promote the construction of our socialist family and the cause of peace that is of common concern to the people of the world.

Li Yongho spoke at the beginning of the reception. He first talked about the glorious victories achieved by the Korean people during the period of peaceful construction, the Great Fatherland Liberation War, and the post-war reconstruction period in the past twelve years, with the friendly assistance of the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union; and talked about the situation that the US imperialists who occupied the southern half of Korea were further strengthening their aggressive colonial enslavement policy, and the Li Chengwan (Syngman Rhee) bandit gang turned South Korea into an unprecedented dark world.

Li Yongho said that the US imperialists and the Li Chengwan bandit gang obstructed and undermined the activities of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in South Korea, which contributed to maintaining and consolidating the armistice. More recently, they have been frantically carrying out new war provocations by transporting new weapons into South Korea and moving the so-called United Nations Command from Japan to South Korea, thereby violating the most important provisions of the armistice agreement.

He said that we believe that such barbaric provocative acts by the US imperialists must not be tolerated, the activities of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission must continue to be thoroughly guaranteed in the future, and the provisions of the armistice agreement must be strictly observed. The provocative acts of the US side in preparing for a new war in Korea must be stopped immediately, and the peaceful reunification of Korea must be achieved on the basis of the withdrawal of all foreign troops from North and South Korea and without any foreign interference. We still maintain that in order to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, an international conference with the broad participation of relevant countries must be convened.

He said that our legitimate propositions have been supported by peace-loving countries and peace-loving people all over the world.

He said that today, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic Government, the Korean people are further intensifying the struggle to achieve remarkable achievements in socialist construction in the northern half of the Republic for the peaceful reunification of their motherland.

Ambassador Li Yongho also said that the traditional friendly relations between the people of Korea and China, forged with blood in the common struggle against foreign aggressors over a long period of time, have become a model of friendship and unity for all people and are being strengthened day by day. The Korean people are watching with infinite joy the great victories achieved by the fraternal Chinese people in the cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation.

He also pointed out that the US and British imperialists are trying to undermine the unity between the Middle East and the Arab countries and to stifle their national independence, and are recently provoking an aggressive war against the people of Oman. However, because the people of all countries are resolutely fighting to defend their national freedom and independence, and because the people of the powerful socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union and other peace-loving people support this struggle, the invaders will surely be defeated!

During the reception, the hosts and guests frequently raised their glasses to wish prosperity and happiness to the countries and peoples of Korea and China, to wish friendship and unity among the people of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, to wish friendly cooperation among peace-loving countries and people all over the world, to wish friendship and unity between the people of Korea and China, and to wish good health to the leaders of the two countries.

The Polish Ambassador, the head of the diplomatic mission in China, Kirilok, extended congratulations to the Korean Democratic People's Republic on behalf of the diplomatic missions in China.

Vice Premier Chen Yi, Vice Chairman Guo Moruo, Vice Minister Zhang Wentian, General Li Kenong and heads of various departments of Chinese state leading organs, as well as combat heroes of the Volunteer Army and families of the Volunteer Army, model workers and other well-known figures from all walks of life attended tonight's reception.

Diplomatic envoys from various countries to China also attended the reception.

    庆祝朝鲜解放十二周年
    朝鲜大使举行盛大酒会
    朱德副主席谴责美国破坏朝鲜停战协定
    新华社15日讯  朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻华大使李永镐今晚在北京举行盛大酒会，庆祝朝鲜解放十二周年。
    朱德副主席和中外人士一千多人出席了酒会。
    朱德副主席在会上讲话，代表中国政府和人民向朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和朝鲜人民致以热烈的祝贺。
    他盛赞了十二年来朝鲜人民在反抗帝国主义侵略、争取祖国的独立和和平统一、创造幸福美好生活的斗争中所取得的光辉的成就，和为和缓国际局势所做出的卓越的贡献。
    朱德副主席说：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国一贯坚持和平解决朝鲜问题的合理主张，并为维护停战协定的有效实施作出了不懈的努力。与此相反，美国和南朝鲜当局却违反朝鲜人民的意志，一贯阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决。最近，美方竟破坏朝鲜停战协定，向南朝鲜运进新式武器，这是美国对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和朝鲜人民以及一切爱好和平的国家和人民的一次严重挑衅。中国人民严厉谴责美国这种破坏朝鲜停战协定、敌视朝鲜人民、加剧朝鲜和远东紧张局势的非法行为。我们坚决支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府关于召开有关国家广泛参加的国际会议的合理建议。
    朱德副主席说，中国人民满意地看到，朝鲜和中国之间、朝鲜和社会主义各国之间的友谊与团结，正在日益巩固和发展。我们深信，以苏联为首的社会主义国家的伟大团结，必将进一步促进我们社会主义大家庭的建设事业和全世界人民所共同关心的和平事业。
    李永镐在酒会开始时讲话。他首先谈到了十二年来，在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的友好帮助下，朝鲜人民在和平建设时期、伟大的祖国解放战争时期和战后恢复建设时期，所取得的辉煌胜利；谈到了霸占着朝鲜南半部的美帝国主义在进一步加强其侵略性的殖民地奴化政策，以及李承晚匪帮把南朝鲜变成史无前例的黑暗天地的情况。
    李永镐说，美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮阻挠和破坏了对维持和巩固停战有所贡献的中立国监察委员会在南朝鲜的活动，最近则更以把新式武器运入南朝鲜、把所谓联合国军司令部从日本迁到南朝鲜等行为破坏停战协定最重要的条款，疯狂地进行着新的战争挑衅。
    他说，我们认为，对美帝国主义的这种蛮横的挑衅行为决不能容忍，中立国监察委员会的活动今后必须继续彻底保证，停战协定的条款必须严格遵守。美方在朝鲜进行新战争准备的挑衅行为必须立即停止，朝鲜的和平统一必须在把一切外国军队撤出南北朝鲜、不受任何外国干涉的民主的基础上实现。我们仍然主张：为了和平解决朝鲜问题，必须召开由有关国家广泛参加的国际会议。
    他说，我们的正当主张得到了全世界爱好和平国家和广泛的爱好和平人民的支持。
    他说，今天，朝鲜人民在朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府的领导下，为了自己祖国的和平统一，正在共和国北半部进一步加紧进行着使社会主义建设成绩卓著的斗争。
    李永镐大使又说，长期以来在反对外来侵略者的共同斗争中用鲜血结成的朝中两国人民的传统的友好关系，已经成为所有人民友好团结的榜样，并正在日益加强。朝鲜人民怀着无限欢欣的心情注视着兄弟的中国人民在社会主义建设事业和社会主义改造事业中取得的巨大胜利。
    他又指出，美英帝国主义正为了破坏中东和阿拉伯各国人民之间的团结而扼杀他们的民族独立，最近正在挑起反对阿曼人民的侵略战争。但是，由于各国人民为了捍卫自己民族的自由和独立而坚决进行斗争，由于以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营国家人民和其它爱好和平人民支持了这一斗争，侵略者一定会遭到失败！
    席间，宾主频频举杯，祝朝中两国国家和人民的繁荣和幸福，祝以苏联为首的社会主义国家人民间的友谊和团结，祝全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的友好合作，祝朝中两国人民的友谊和团结，祝两国领导人的身体健康。
    波兰大使、各国驻华使节团团长基里洛克代表各国驻华使节向朝鲜民主主义人民共和国表示祝贺。
    陈毅副总理，郭沫若副委员长，张闻天副部长，李克农上将和中国国家领导机关各部门负责人，以及志愿军战斗英雄和志愿军家属、劳动模范和其他各界著名人士出席了今晚酒会。
    各国驻华使节也出席了酒会。
