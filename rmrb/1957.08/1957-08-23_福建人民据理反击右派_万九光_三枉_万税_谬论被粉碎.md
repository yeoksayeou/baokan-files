Fujian People Refute Rightists With Reason
Wan Jiuguang's "Three Wrongs" and "Ten Thousand Taxes" Fallacies Smashed

    (Our dispatch) The so-called "Three Wrongs" and "Ten Thousand Taxes" fallacies of Wan Jiuguang, a rightist element and member of the Nanping City Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Fujian Province, have been smashed by the powerful counterattack of the masses.

    On June 12, Wan Jiuguang launched a vicious attack on the Communist Party at the Nanping City Committee of the CPPCC. He said that the Communist Party was "wrong in principle, wrong in reason, and wrong in law." The suppression of counter-revolutionaries was carried out in a "weeding" style, grabbing both the rice and the weeds. The elimination of counter-revolutionaries was like a "sifting rice" process, leaving many people dizzy. Wan Jiuguang also shouted: "The Communist Party charges ten thousand taxes, ten thousand taxes, ten thousand ten thousand taxes!" He also "suggested" that the Communist Party implement his "benevolent governance." He said that this point could not be found in Marxism-Leninism. He believed that "benevolence" is the heart of compassion, so penalties should be reduced. Public security and political and legal work can be relaxed a little, so as not to make "the people" feel anxious. He also wanted to reverse "unjust verdicts" and reduce taxes.

    These extremely reactionary remarks of the rightist Wan Jiuguang have been met with unanimous condemnation from people from all walks of life in Nanping City and the masses in other areas of Fujian Province. Guan Liquan, a cadre in Nanping City, and others said: In 1950, the exposure of the conspiracy organization headed by Lu Bingrong, director of the "Kuomintang Fujian-Jiangxi Front Assault Headquarters Political Training Office" in Nanping, was applauded by the people. Only people like Wan Jiuguang would feel "compassion" and cry "injustice." Li Sen and others, farmers from Hutou Township, Nanping County, said: The current tax is correct and reasonable. Only the Kuomintang charged "ten thousand taxes": things like conscription fees, baojia fees, bandit suppression fees, wounded soldier donations, comfort fees, god welcoming fees, night patrol fees, house number donations, pig donations, cattle donations, mountain donations, and even manure donations; in addition to regular taxes, there were surcharges. Even marrying a wife required sticking a stamp and paying taxes. The working people had suffered enough from the pain of exorbitant taxes and levies.

    According to disclosures, Wan Jiuguang once served as the chief secretary of the Kuomintang county government and was also an unscrupulous merchant. Before liberation, he secretly arrested and executed many Communist Party members, patriotic people, and innocent civilians with the pseudo-police chief. The masses have already tasted the taste of Wan Jiuguang's "benevolent governance." (Nan Jiang)

　　福建人民据理反击右派
　　万九光“三枉”“万税”谬论被粉碎
    本报讯　在群众有力的反击下，福建省右派分子、政协福建省南平市委员万九光的所谓共产党“三枉”、“万税”的谬论已被粉碎。
    6月12日，万九光在政协南平市委员会上，对共产党发出了恶毒的攻击。他说：共产党是“枉道、枉理、枉法”。镇反是采用“拔草式”，稻和草一把抓，肃反是“筛米式”，搞得许多人头昏脑胀。万九光还大叫：“共产党万税、万税、万万税”。他还“建议”共产党推行他的“仁政”。他说这一点是马列主义里找不到的。他认为“仁”就是恻隐之心，因此要省刑罚：公安、政法工作可以放松一点，免得“老百姓”提心吊胆，还要平反“冤狱”、减轻税收。
    右派分子万九光这些反动透顶的言论，受到了南平市各界人民和福建省其他地区群众的同声声讨。南平市干部关立泉等说：1950年，在南平破获了以“国民党闽赣前线突击司令部政训处”主任卢炳荣为首的阴谋组织，人民莫不拍手称快，只有万九光之流才会感到“恻隐”，大叫“冤枉”。南平县湖头乡农民李森等说：现在的税收是正确的，合理的，只有国民党才是“万税”：什么壮丁费、保甲费、戡乱费、伤兵捐、慰劳费、迎神费、巡夜费、门牌捐、猪捐、牛捐、山头捐，还有粪捐，正税之外还有附加税，连讨老婆贴印花还要报税，劳动人民受够了苛捐杂税的痛苦。
    根据揭发，万九光曾任国民党县府主任秘书，又是奸商，解放前和伪警察局长等秘密逮捕和处死很多共产党员、爱国志士及无辜平民，群众已经尝够万九光的“仁政”的滋味了。　（南江）
