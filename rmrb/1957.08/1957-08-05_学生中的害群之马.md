    Vermin Among Students
    Jiang Zhuolian – A Rightist Ring Leader Among Students
    This newspaper reports that Jiang Zhuolian, the chairman of the student union of Henan Agricultural College, colluded with other rightists and frantically attacked the Party after the start of the rectification campaign. She waved her arms and shouted, "A level twelve typhoon has arrived, the battle has begun!" Jiang Zhuolian used the name of the student union to start fires everywhere. Regarding the merger of the forestry department students, she posted big-character posters to incite students to petition in Beijing. She also ran to the geological training class of the Ministry of Geology, introducing "speaking out" "experience," instigating students to hold a general meeting to first attack the Party leadership. She also mobilized students to "support" the "speaking out" at Zhengzhou Normal College. Within the school, she colluded with an anti-Party clique headed by the rightist Zeng Zhansen, slandering "the anti-rebellion campaign at the Agricultural College as illegal and undisciplined." She used the student union to pass a resolution establishing an "anti-rebellion investigation team," declaring that this team was not under the leadership of the Party and demanding that the Party organization let them view archives. She also convened an "accusation meeting" to conduct reactionary activities. The students have opened their eyes and launched a struggle against her.
    Why does Jiang Zhuolian hate the leadership of the Party so much? It turns out that she was born into a large landlord family with 3,000 mu of land. Her father, Jiang Wenxiu, served as the Kuomintang district chief, county council speaker, and head of the military-civilian cooperation station, oppressing and exploiting many working people. He was suppressed by the People's Government during the land reform. Her fourth and fifth uncles were both evil landlords who fled in fear of punishment during the land reform. Jiang Zhuolian is attacking the Party from the reactionary standpoint of defending her family's interests.
    The Connection Between Huo Ligong and Lin Xiling
    This newspaper reports that Huo Ligong, a student in the history department of Northwest University, launched an extremely malicious attack on the Party and the socialist system. Huo Ligong said that since the difference between workers and peasants still exists today, China is not yet a socialist society. He fabricated the lies that "the Communist Party favors workers and is mean to peasants" and "workers exploit peasants," attempting to sow discord between workers and peasants and undermine the foundation of our people's democratic dictatorship – the worker-peasant alliance. Huo Ligong clamored to overthrow the student union and elect his own "leadership organization."
    Huo Ligong was born into a landlord class family. When he worked at the Xinhua Bookstore in Jingyuan County, Gansu Province, he violated laws and regulations. He was originally a member of the Communist Youth League, but during the Three-Anti Campaign, he resisted the movement, suppressed democracy, and had contact with a local counter-revolutionary element. Despite repeated education from the organization, he was arrested and detained for six months and then expelled from the League. This is Huo Ligong's brief ugly history, and it is also the root cause of his hatred of the Party. Huo Ligong also received support from Lin Xiling. In a letter to him, Lin Xiling said that she "risked great danger" to steal Party documents for him to read, which was "of great help" to his research and exploration of issues.
    Now, Huo Ligong and Lin Xiling, these two rightists, are suffering the same fate.

    学生中的害群之马
    姜卓廉——学生中的右派女头目
    本报讯　河南农学院学生会主席姜卓廉在整风开始后，和其他右派分子勾结猖狂向党进攻。她挥手高喊“十二级大风暴已经来临，战斗开始了”。姜卓廉利用学生会的名义到处点火，在林学系学生并系问题上，她贴出大字报煽动学生到北京请愿。她又跑到地质部地质训练班，介绍鸣、放“经验”，唆使学生开大会首先打击党的领导。她还发动学生去“支援”郑州师专的“鸣放”。在校内，她又和右派分子曾展森为首的反党小集团勾结在一起，污蔑“农学院的肃反是违法乱纪”。她利用学生会通过决议成立“肃反调查小组”，宣称这个小组不受党的领导，并要挟党组织让他们查看档案材料，她还召开“控诉大会”，进行反动活动。学生都擦亮眼睛，与她展开了斗争。
    姜卓廉为什么这样痛恨党的领导呢？原来她出身于三千亩地的大地主家庭，父亲姜文修曾任国民党区长、县参议长、军民合作站站长，摧残压榨过不少劳动人民，在土改中被人民政府镇压了。她的四叔、五叔都是恶霸地主，在土改时畏罪潜逃。姜卓廉就是站在维护她家庭利益的反动立场上，向党进攻的。
    霍力功和林希翎的瓜葛
    本报讯　西北大学历史系学生霍力功，向党向社会主义制度进行极其恶毒的攻击。霍力功说，既然今天工农差别还存在，所以目前中国还不是社会主义社会。他又捏造了“共产党偏爱工人，刻薄农民”，“工人剥削农民”的鬼话，企图借此挑拨工农关系，破坏我国人民民主专政的基础——工农联盟。霍力功叫嚣推翻学生会，选举自己的“领导机构”。
    霍力功出身于地主阶级家庭，他在甘肃靖远县新华书店工作的时候，就违法乱纪。他原来是青年团员，但在三反中他抗拒运动，压制民主，并且和当地一个反革命分子有来往，虽经组织多次教育无效，结果被逮捕管押了六个月，以后被开除团籍。这就是霍力功的简要丑史，也是他仇视党的根源所在。霍力功还得到林希翎的支持。林希翎在给他的信中说：她“冒着极大的危险”，偷窃了党内文件给他看，对他研究和探讨问题“有很大帮助”。
    现在，霍力功和林希翎这两个右派分子，遭到同样的下场。
