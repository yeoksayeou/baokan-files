    On "Wah-la Wah-la"
    Yue Jun
    Democracy, democracy, how many people have shed blood and sacrificed themselves for democracy, and how many more are hanging up the "democracy" signboard to sell dog meat! Capitalist apologists abroad say that our parliaments "wah-la wah-la" all day long – how democratic! Whereas you always "completely endorse" and "unanimously pass" everything; where's the democracy in that? Domestic right-wing ambitionists are also singing the praises of bourgeois democracy. Zhang Bojun said: "The capitalist countries' method is: if you can't do it, I'll come; if I can't do it, you come. The party in power scolds the party out of power, and the party out of power scolds the party in power. That's vitality."
    Of course, the rightist gentlemen advocate bourgeois democracy in order to achieve their anti-Party and anti-socialist goals through parliamentary politics. But the "wah-la wah-la" in capitalist countries' parliaments often easily gives people the illusion of so-called "absolute democracy," and this illusion exists among some intellectuals.
    It is true that they can "wah-la wah-la" in capitalist countries' parliaments, but who can "wah-la wah-la" there? Mainly representatives of bourgeois political parties. In the US Senate and House of Representatives, there are only the Republican and Democratic parties controlled by Wall Street bosses. The American working people have no place in Congress. Even outside the parliament, people's "wah-la wah-la" must have a limit, that is, it must not harm the bourgeois oligarchy, otherwise it is "un-American activity."
    The rightist gentlemen greatly admire British politics, so let's talk about Britain. The British House of Commons is mainly composed of the Conservative and Labour parties, and these parties are also bourgeois political parties. The British people seem to be able to "wah-la wah-la" in Hyde Park outside Parliament, but outside Hyde Park, the Communist Party and other progressive organizations are often refused rental of venues or refused broadcasting on the radio to hold election rallies; candidates must also pay a large amount of money as a deposit. This effectively blocks the true representatives of the impoverished working people from entering Parliament. Of course, the British Communist Party is sometimes able to break through the obstacles of the bourgeoisie to send representatives into Parliament, but the voices of these representatives are usually strangled by the bourgeois news media. It can be seen that the British-style "wah-la wah-la" is entirely for the purpose of consolidating the rule of the bourgeoisie and deceiving the working people!
    Zhang Bojun said that in capitalist countries, it is possible to "if you can't do it, I'll come; if I can't do it, you come." This sounds very democratic, but "you" and "I" are both bourgeois political parties, and changing back and forth is just a change of soup without changing the medicine. May I ask if the American bourgeoisie is willing to let the American Communist Party come out to form a government? It turns out that the bourgeoisie changes its left and right hands back and forth, and uses this kind of change to deceive the people.
    The rightist gentlemen also said: We don't want the capitalist economic system, we only want capitalist parliamentary politics. Doesn't Zhang Bojun think that China's socialism without the addition of British and American parliamentary politics is a great pity? Isn't he saying "I love socialism, and I love democracy"? Aren't the right-wing Social Democrats in the international arena shouting "social democracy" or "democratic socialism"? But what socialism did the British Labour Party, which shouted "democratic socialism," implement during its past term in office? Without the capitalist political system, there can be no socialist economic system. The socialist economic system can only be realized and consolidated under the leadership of the working-class party. If we really implemented British and American-style parliamentary politics according to the opinions of the rightist gentlemen, allowing a small group of bourgeois politicians to "wah-la wah-la" all day long, and then still wanted to preserve the socialist economy, that would be too naive. In a class society, there will be no supra-class state, and there will be no supra-class democracy. The democratic system is closely related to the dictatorship of the class in power. Which class is in power, which class determines the essence of democracy. We never hide this point, while the bourgeoisie always deceives the people by saying that their democracy is supra-class. However, the class interests of the bourgeoisie make it impossible for them to give democracy to other classes. The bourgeoisie's so-called democracy is only the democracy of one class, or even the democracy of a few monopoly capital groups; for other classes, it can only be said to be bourgeois dictatorship. The "wah-la wah-la" of the bourgeois parliament is like a colorful coat, seemingly beautiful, but how much hunger, poverty, tears, and suffering of the working people does it cover up!
    Admittedly, the parliamentary politics of capitalist countries is a great step forward compared to the feudal autocracy. The working people and Communists in some capitalist countries also conduct struggles through parliament. But this is by no means because it has any superiority over our socialist democratic system, but because they are in capitalist countries, and parliament is a real existence. As for us, since we have a socialist democratic system that is more advanced than the bourgeois democratic system, why should we go backwards?
    We say that we have full democracy for the people here. At the People's Congress and the CPPCC, haven't many people spoken and criticized the shortcomings in the government's work? We have a common goal and common interests, and any problem can be "unanimously passed" and "completely endorsed" after full consultation and discussion in advance. Our Constitution, before being passed by the People's Congress, went through nearly a year and a half of deliberation by representatives from all sides, and was finally submitted to the national people for discussion, with more than 150 million people participating. What extensive and full democracy this is! Yes, our "unanimous passage" and "complete endorsement" once included the false passage and false endorsement of a few rightist elements mixed in with the people, but this can only show their insidious two-faced methods. This spirit of full consultation and democracy, and respect for non-Party people, cannot be denied even by the rightist elements themselves. As for capitalist countries, there are irreconcilable contradictions between this monopoly capital group and that monopoly capital group, or between bourgeois members of parliament and working people's members of parliament, so it is impossible to have our kind of "unanimous passage" and "complete endorsement." Lenin said that bourgeois democracy is "narrow, truncated, false and hypocritical, a paradise for the rich and a trap and deception for the poor and exploited." ("The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky") But the rightist gentlemen insist on peddling this junk!

    论“哇啦哇啦”
    岳军
    民主，民主，多少人为了民主而流血牺牲，又有多少人挂了“民主”的羊头在卖狗肉！国外的资本主义维护者说，我们的议会整天“哇啦哇啦”，多么民主；而你们，总是“完全拥护”，“一致通过”，哪有民主呀。国内的右派野心家也在高唱资产阶级民主的颂歌了。章伯钧说：“资本主义国家的办法是：你不行，我来，我不行，你来。在朝的骂在野的，在野的骂在朝的，这就是活力。”
    当然，右派先生们主张资产阶级民主，是为了通过议会政治，达到反党反社会主义的目的。但资本主义国家议会里的“哇啦哇啦”，常常容易给人一种所谓“绝对民主”的错觉，这种错觉，在一部分知识分子中是存在的。
    不错，资本主义国家议会里可以“哇啦哇啦”，但是，谁能在那儿“哇啦哇啦”呢？主要是资产阶级政党的代表。美国的参众两院里，只有华尔街老板控制的共和党和民主党。美国劳动人民在国会里没有地位。即使在议会外面，人民“哇啦哇啦”也得有个限度，就是说，不得危害资产阶级寡头统治，否则就是“非美活动”。
    右派先生们很赞美英国的政治，我们就谈英国吧。英国下议院主要是保守党和工党，这些党也都是资产阶级政党。英国人民好像可以在议会外面的海德公园“哇啦哇啦”，但在海德公园以外，共产党和其他进步组织要举行竞选大会，却常被拒绝租赁会场或被拒绝在电台广播；竞选人还要交纳大量资金作保证金。这在实际上阻塞了贫困的劳动人民的真正代表进入议会。当然，英国共产党有时也能够冲破资产阶级的阻挠把代表送到议会里去，但是这些代表的呼声照例总是被资产阶级的新闻机关扼杀了。可见英国式的“哇啦哇啦”，完全是为了巩固资产阶级的统治，并且是为了欺骗劳动人民的！
    章伯钧说在资本主义国家里可以“你不行，我来，我不行，你来”，这像煞很民主，但“你”“我”都是资产阶级政党，换来换去也是换汤不换药。试问美国资产阶级愿意让美国共产党出来组织政府吗？原来资产阶级换来换去的是自己的左右手，并且用这种换法来欺骗人民。
    右派先生们又说了：我们不要资本主义的经济制度，只要资本主义的议会政治。章伯钧不是认为中国的社会主义没有加上英美的议会政治，是件大憾事吗？他不是在说
  “我爱社会主义，也爱民主”吗？国际上的右派社会党人不是在高喊“社会民主主义”或“民主社会主义”吗？但高喊“民主社会主义”的英国工党，在过去执政期间，实行了什么社会主义？有了资本主义的政治制度，就不可能有社会主义的经济制度。社会主义经济制度只有在工人阶级政党的领导下，才能实现和巩固。如果我们按照右派先生们的意见，真地实行了英美式的议会政治，让一小批资产阶级政客整天“哇啦哇啦”，到了那时，还想保存社会主义经济，那未免太天真了，在阶级社会里，超阶级的国家不会有，超阶级的民主也不会有。民主制是和掌握政权的阶级的专政密切关联着的。哪个阶级掌握政权，哪个阶级就决定了民主的本质。我们从不掩盖这一点，而资产阶级总是欺骗人民说，他们的民主是超阶级的。然而资产阶级的阶级利益，使他们不可能给别的阶级以民主。资产阶级所谓的民主，不过是他们一个阶级的民主，甚至是少数垄断资本集团的民主，对别的阶级，只能说是资产阶级专政。资产阶级议会的“哇啦哇啦”，像一件五颜六色的外衣，好像很美丽，然而它掩盖了多少劳动人民的饥饿、贫困、眼泪和痛苦呵！
    诚然，资本主义国家的议会政治，较之封建专制制度，是大大地跨进了一步的。有些资本主义国家的劳动人民和共产党，也通过议会进行斗争。但这决不是因为它比我们的社会主义民主制度有什么优越性，而是因为他们处在资本主义国家里，议会是现实存在的东西。至于我们，既然有了比资产阶级民主制度先进的社会主义民主制度，为什么要倒退过去呢？
    我们说，我们这里对人民有充分的民主。人民代表大会上、政协会上，不是有很多人说了话、并且批评了政府工作中的缺点吗？我们有一致的目标、共同的利益，什么问题经过事先的充分协商和讨论，都有可能“一致通过”、“完全拥护”的。我们的宪法，在人民代表大会通过之前，经过了各方面代表人物将近一年半时间的酝酿，最后交全国人民讨论，有一亿五千多万人参加，这是何等广泛、充分的民主！是的，我们的“一致通过”、“完全拥护”，也曾经包括少数混在人民队伍里的右派分子的假通过、假拥护，但这只能说明他们阴险的两面手法。这种充分协商的民主精神，和对党外人士的尊重，即使是右派分子自己，也无法否认的。至于资本主义国家，他们的这个垄断资本集团和那个垄断资本集团之间，或者资产阶级议员和劳动人民的议员之间，有着不可调和的矛盾，所以不可能有我们这样的“一致通过”“完全拥护”的。列宁说，资产阶级民主是“狭窄的，残缺的，虚伪的，假仁假义的民主，对于富人为天堂，对于穷人和被剥削者为陷阱为骗局。”（“无产阶级革命与叛徒考茨基”）而右派先生们偏偏还想兜售这种破烂货哩！
