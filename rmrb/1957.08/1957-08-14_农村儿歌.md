Rural Children's Songs
    Li Zuohua

    Cutting Grass
    The sun is red, the grass is green, the green grass is sparkling. The curved sickle, shining bright, the sickle dances in the green grass. The grass in the basket, tender and green, the cow will surely be happy to eat.

    Carrying Manure
    In March, the flowers are bright, I carry the manure in a puff of smoke, carrying fertilizer to the fields. In March, the flowers are bright, I carry the manure in a puff of smoke, the flowers and seedlings show smiling faces. In March, the flowers are bright, I carry the manure in a puff of smoke, and the autumn harvest fills the granary.

    农村儿歌
    李作华
    割草太阳红，草青青，青草上面亮晶晶。弯弯镰，闪闪明，镰儿舞在绿草丛。篮里草，嫩青青，牛儿吃了准高兴。
    挑粪三月里，花儿艳，我挑起粪挑一溜烟，挑挑肥料送下田。三月里，花儿艳，我挑起粪挑一溜烟，花儿苗儿露笑脸。三月里，花儿艳，我挑起粪挑一溜烟，秋收粮食满仓填。
