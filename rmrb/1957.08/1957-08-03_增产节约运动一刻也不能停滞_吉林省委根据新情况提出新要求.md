The Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign Must Not Stagnate for a Moment
Jilin Provincial Party Committee Proposes New Requirements Based on New Circumstances

(From Our Newspaper) The Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) recently inspected the progress of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign in industrial and mining enterprises, and made arrangements on how to further promote the campaign. The Jilin Provincial People's Committee issued a decision on implementing the State Council's "Directive on Further Developing the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign."

According to the Jilin Provincial Committee of the CCP's inspection, the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign in Jilin Province this year has yielded great results. According to statistics from the first half of the year, centrally administered industries completed 117.4% of the total output value plan, an increase of 24.6% compared to the same period last year (based on comparable figures, same below); labor productivity completed 108.9% of the plan, an increase of 14% compared to the same period last year; of the 25 major products, 24 completed their plans. Local industries completed 105.6% of the total output value plan, an increase of 8.25% compared to the same period last year. Handicraft cooperatives completed 104.4% of their output value plan. Costs have also been reduced. The Jilin Chemical Industrial Zone construction project completed 104.7% of the planned workload in the second quarter.

The inspection revealed that the main problems currently are: Some units believe that difficulties have been overcome, tasks have been completed, or that completing tasks is not a major problem, and thus a mood of complacency and relaxation has arisen. Other units, while not relaxing, cannot find a direction or raise problems for the next step, which has caused the movement to temporarily stagnate and decline.

The Jilin Provincial Committee of the CCP believes that, in order to further develop the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign, the first problem that must be solved is to propose new requirements and set new tasks to the masses under the new circumstances. All economic management organs and enterprises should seriously check the implementation of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Plan and the progress of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign in the first half of the year. Based on the new circumstances, they should mobilize the masses to make necessary revisions and supplements to the Increase Production and Practice Economy Plan, and then launch the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign centering on the implementation of the new plan. The problems to be solved in the movement should be comprehensive, but there must also be a focus. It was incorrect for some units to pay insufficient attention to product quality, safe production, and economic accounting in the first half of the year. However, it was entirely right to focus on increasing production and saving raw materials, and it was precisely because of this focus that the achievements of the first half of the year were obtained. As the situation has changed, the focus should not be universally on increasing production and saving raw materials when revising the Increase Production and Practice Economy Plan for the second half of the year. Instead, based on the spirit of the State Council's instructions and the different conditions of each enterprise, different key requirements should be proposed. While striving to achieve different key requirements, it is also necessary to universally pay attention to improving product quality and ensuring safe production. When revising the Increase Production and Practice Economy Plan, basic construction units must earnestly implement the State Council's instructions, oppose the extravagant young master style of blindly pursuing modernization, mechanization, high standards, and demanding omnipotence and unwillingness to cooperate. Of course, attention must also be paid to preventing the tendency of saving that results in waste.

The Jilin Provincial Committee of the CCP believes that, in order to further develop the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign, it is also necessary to grasp the extremely important link of promoting advanced experience. The reason why the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign in the first half of this year was able to achieve such results is closely related to the role played by the advanced experience promoted last year. However, many units did not do as well in promoting advanced experience in the first half of this year as they did last year. Therefore, in the second half of the year, all units must strengthen this work, focusing on the implementation of the revised Increase Production and Practice Economy Plan. Holding professional meetings, organizing planned visits and demonstrations, and establishing advanced experience exchange networks among units in the same industry are all effective ways to promote advanced experience. These methods should continue to be used to do a good job in promoting advanced experience.

In order to adjust internal contradictions within enterprises, mobilize all positive factors, and ensure the smooth development of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign, the Jilin Provincial Committee of the CCP also requires all units to do the following three tasks well: First, hold good workers' representative conferences and give play to the supervisory role of the masses; second, leading cadres must overcome bureaucracy, go deep among the masses, share weal and woe with the masses, solve problems that should be solved and can be solved, and strengthen ties with the masses; third, conduct in-depth socialist education, raise the class consciousness of workers, and overcome the current undesirable tendencies among some workers, such as lax discipline, extreme democracy, and excessive demands for living and welfare.

### 增产节约运动一刻也不能停滞  吉林省委根据新情况提出新要求

    增产节约运动一刻也不能停滞
    吉林省委根据新情况提出新要求
    本报讯　中共吉林省委不久前检查了工矿企业中开展增产节约运动的情况，并对如何进一步开展这一运动作了部署。吉林省人民委员会颁发了关于贯彻执行国务院“关于进一步开展增产节约运动的指示”的决定。
    根据中共吉林省委的检查，今年吉林省增产节约运动的收获是很大的。据上半年的统计，中央所属工业完成总产值计划117.4％，比去年同期（按可比数，下同）增长24.6％；劳动生产率计划完成108.9％，比去年同期增长14％；二十五种主要产品中，有二十四种完成了计划。地方工业完成总产值计划105.6％，比去年同期增长8.25％。手工业合作社完成产值计划104.4％。成本也都有所降低。吉林化工区的建设工程，在第二季度完成计划工作量104.7％。
    检查中发现，当前的主要问题是：有些单位认为困难突破了，任务完成了，或者完成任务没有多大问题了，便产生出一种自满松劲情绪，还有一些单位，虽然没有松劲，但下一步如何办，找不出方向，提不出问题，因而使运动一时呈现出一种停滞消沉的现象。
    中共吉林省委认为，为了把增产节约运动进一步开展起来，首先必须解决的一个问题，就是在新的情况下，要向群众提出新的要求，规定新的任务。各经济管理机关、各企业单位都应该认真检查一下上半年对增产节约方案的执行情况和增产节约运动的开展情况，根据新的情况发动群众对增产节约方案进行必要的修改和补充，然后以实现新的方案为中心把增产节约运动开展起来。运动中所要解决的问题应该是全面的，同时也必须有重点。上半年有些单位对产品质量、安全生产、经济核算注意不够是不对的，但普遍抓住了增产和节约原材料这个重点是完全应该的，正因为抓住了这个重点才取得了上半年的成绩。由于情况已经发生了变化，在修订下半年的增产节约方案的时候，就不能普遍以增产节约原材料为重点了，而应在巩固上半年节约原材料成绩的基础上，根据国务院指示的精神和各企业的不同情况，提出不同重点要求；在努力实现不同的重点要求中，又必须普遍注意提高产品质量，保证安全生产。基本建设单位在修订增产节约方案的时候，必须认真贯彻国务院的指示，反对盲目追求现代化、机械化、高标准和要求全能、不愿协作的阔少爷作风，当然也要注意防止为了节约反而造成浪费的偏向。
    中共吉林省委认为，为了把增产节约运动进一步开展起来，还必须抓住推广先进经验这个极为重要的环节。今年上半年的增产节约运动所以能获得那样的成绩，同去年所推广的先进经验所发挥的作用有不小关系。但是，今年上半年许多单位在推广先进经验方面做的不如去年。因此，下半年各单位必须以实现修订后的增产节约方案为中心，把这项工作加强起来。召开专业会议，有计划地组织参观表演，产业相同的单位建立先进经验交流网等，都是推广先进经验的有效办法，应该继续运用这些办法，做好推广先进经验的工作。
    为了调整企业内部矛盾，调动一切积极因素，保证增产节约运动的顺利开展，中共吉林省委还要求各单位做好以下三项工作：一、开好职工代表大会，发挥群众的监督作用；二、领导干部要克服官僚主义，深入群众，与群众同甘共苦，解决应该解决而又可能解决的问题，密切同群众的联系；三、深入进行社会主义教育，提高职工的阶级觉悟，克服目前某些职工中在滋长的纪律松弛、极端民主、对生活福利要求过高等不良倾向。
