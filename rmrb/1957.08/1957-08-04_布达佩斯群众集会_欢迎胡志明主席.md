Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, August 3rd. A mass rally of thousands of people was held in Budapest on the afternoon of the 2nd to welcome Chairman Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    Hungarian Minister of State Marosan spoke at the meeting. He said that the meeting between the representatives of Hungary and Vietnam can promote better mutual learning and exchange of experiences between the two countries. The Hungarian people have always supported the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people. Now, we also support the Vietnamese people's struggle to establish a unified Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    Marosan said that in the difficult days of the counter-revolutionary events in Hungary last October, the Vietnamese people supported us and severely condemned the imperialist attempt to interfere in Hungary's internal affairs. In January of this year, they provided Hungary with material assistance worth three million rubles. We should thank the Vietnamese people for this.

    Next, Chairman Ho Chi Minh spoke. He said that the Hungarian incident was a counter-revolutionary incident, not a revolutionary incident as some people say. Therefore, we fully sympathize with and support the measures taken by our brother party and people to date, and we fully support the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party headed by Kadar.

    布达佩斯群众集会
    欢迎胡志明主席
    新华社布达佩斯3日电　布达佩斯在2日下午举行了数千人的群众大会，欢迎越南民主共和国主席胡志明。
    匈牙利国务部长马罗山在大会上讲了话。他说，匈越两国代表的会见可以促进两国更好地互相学习和交流经验。匈牙利人民一直是支持越南人民的英勇斗争的。现在，我们同样支持越南人民为建立统一的越南民主共和国而进行的斗争。
    马罗山说，在匈牙利去年十月反革命事件的艰难日子里，越南人民支援了我们，严厉地谴责了帝国主义干涉匈牙利内政的企图，今年1月，又给予匈牙利三百万卢布的物资援助。这是我们应该感谢越南人民的。
    接着，胡志明主席讲了话。他说，匈牙利事件是反革命事件，而不是像某些人所说的革命事件。因此，我们完全同情和支持我们的兄弟党和人民至今所采取的措施，我们完全支持以卡达尔为首的匈牙利社会主义工人党。
