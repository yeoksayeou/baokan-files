Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 17th: A group of rightists in Wuhan's journalism and publishing circles have been exposed by the masses and revealed their true colors.

According to disclosures, Zhang Xingzhong, who served as an editorial board member and head of the current affairs department at the Hubei Daily, is a vanguard who openly betrayed the Communist Party and joined bourgeois rightists in attacking the Party. In order to win over the masses to attack the Communist Party and socialism with him, Zhang Xingzhong did not hesitate to sell out Communist Party secrets, attempting to turn the current affairs department he led into an "independent kingdom" to resist the leadership of the newspaper. When rightists proposed "electing an editorial board" in an attempt to usurp the leadership of the newspaper, he greatly appreciated it, expressing "complete agreement"; and spread rumors that all Communist Party members would be withdrawn from the Guangming Daily in Beijing. Dominated by bourgeois journalistic viewpoints, Zhang Xingzhong believed that Xinhua News Agency reports were "meaningless" and several times removed Xinhua News Agency reports from the pages, replacing them with reports from Hong Kong newspapers. During the blooming and contending period, he also mobilized staff in the current affairs department to produce big-character posters, demanding a staff representative meeting and openly calling on people in the current affairs department to attack the Communist Party at the representative meeting. He said: "Be bold and speak out! There used to be literary inquisitions, but now you won't be imprisoned!"

Song Xi and Gu Shenchen, two other rightists at the Hubei Daily, also attacked the Communist Party very fiercely. Song Xi, deputy director of the supplement department, once openly attacked the Communist Party at the newspaper's staff representative meeting, saying that the newspaper's leadership "has all kinds of isms, but no Marxism-Leninism." He also slandered and attacked Xu Daoqi, Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Li Erzhong, Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Zeng Chun, Minister of the Provincial Party Committee's Propaganda Department, saying that they "don't care about anything" and "have gone off to be officials." Gu Shenchen, who often styled himself as a "great reporter" and "great editor," besides taking advantage of interview opportunities to ignite and spread poison in schools during the blooming and contending period, was also the first to put forward the "suggestion" of "electing an editorial board" within the newspaper, and publicized everywhere the need to run a "cooperative newspaper." He publicly declared: "No matter how much you criticize, it is impossible to make me sever my bourgeois democratic ideas. How can someone who grew up in the old society not miss it?"

Among the rightists recently exposed in Wuhan's journalism and publishing circles are also Li Zhaomin, editor of Hubei People's Broadcasting Station, as well as Wang Cheng (head of the China Association for Promoting Democracy organization in the publishing house) and Wu Wenshu (member of the China National Democratic Construction Association organization in the publishing house), both editors at the Hubei People's Publishing House. Wang and Wu openly slandered the "Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries" movement, defending counter-revolutionaries such as Hu Feng. Li Zhaomin even openly slandered the anti-rightist struggle, saying that "the anti-rightist struggle is a continuation of the mistakes of the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries, and is still the 'three evils'."

    神圣党报岂容任意篡夺
    武汉新闻界揭发右派分子
    据新华社武汉17日电  武汉市新闻、出版界一批右派分子在群众的揭发下，现出了原形。
    据揭露，在湖北日报担任编辑委员兼时事部主任的张醒钟，是一个公然背叛共产党并同资产阶级右派分子一起向共产党进攻的急先锋。张醒钟为了拉拢群众同他一起攻击共产党和社会主义，他甚至不惜出卖共产党的机密，企图把自己领导的时事部搞成“独立王国”，对抗报社的领导。当右派分子提出要“选举编委会”企图以此来篡夺报社的领导权时，他大为欣赏，表示“完全同意”；并且散播谣言说，共产党员要全部撤出北京的光明日报。在资产阶级新闻观点的支配下，张醒钟认为新华社的消息是“没有意思”的，曾经好几次从版面上把新华社发的消息抽下来，换上香港报纸的消息。在鸣放期间，他还发动时事部的工作人员出大字报，要求召开职工代表会，并公开号召时事部的人到代表会上去攻击共产党。他说：“你们大胆放吧！过去有文字狱，现在不会要你坐牢！”
    湖北日报社的另外两个右派分子宋西和谷深沉，进攻共产党也是非常猖狂的。宋西是副刊部副主任，在报社的职工代表会上，他曾经公开攻击共产党说：报社领导上“什么主义都有，就是没有马列主义”。他还对中共湖北省委书记许道琦，中共武汉市委书记李尔重和省委宣传部长曾淳进行了诬蔑和攻击，说他们“不管事”，“当官去了”。经常以“大记者”、“大编辑”自居的谷深沉，在鸣放期间除利用采访机会在学校点火放毒外，并且在报社内最先提出了“选举编委会”的“建议”，到处宣传要办“同仁报”。他公开宣布说：“无论怎样批判，想叫我割断资产阶级的民主思想是不可能的，从旧社会长大的人怎不留恋呢？”
    武汉新闻、出版界在最近揭露出来的右派分子中，还有湖北人民广播电台编辑李兆民，以及湖北人民出版社编辑汪诚（出版社民进组织的负责人）和吴文蜀（出版社民建组织的成员之一）等。汪、吴曾公开诬蔑“肃反”运动，为胡风等反革命分子辩护。李兆民竟公开诬蔑反右派斗争，说“反右派斗争是肃反错误的继续，仍是三害”。
