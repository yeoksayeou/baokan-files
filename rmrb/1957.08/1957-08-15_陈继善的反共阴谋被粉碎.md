    Chen Jishan's Anti-Communist Plot Smashed

    (Our report) The entire staff and workers of the Luoyang Tractor Factory launched a struggle through reasoning against the rightist Chen Jishan, who attempted to incite a capitalist restoration. Chen Jishan was the chief mechanical engineer of the Luoyang Tractor Factory. He extremely hated the leadership of the Party and flatly denied our country's construction achievements. He compared the Communist Party to an incompetent car driver, "who seems likely to crash at any moment." Chen Jishan also said: "The current shortage of materials is the result of the Communist Party and the government's poor management of enterprises, which wasted the people's surplus value." Chen Jishan also specifically laid down four anti-Party and anti-socialist programs for the China Democratic League, the most important of which were: first, the China Democratic League must be separated from the Communist Party and seize some leadership power from the Communist Party. The Communist Party should hand over the People's Court and the supervisory organs to the democratic parties. He said that only in this way can true mutual supervision be achieved.

    Chen Jishan vigorously promoted the American capitalist economic management methods and advocated that this method be moved to our country unchanged. It turns out that Chen Jishan served as the leader of the Kuomintang's Fifth Army Group's U.S. Technical Military Officer Student Team with the rank of Major General, and served as the Director of the Industrial Mobilization Department of the Kuomintang Ministry of National Defense before liberation. He still has 13,200 US dollars in savings in an American bank and has shares in an American automobile company.

    陈继善的反共阴谋被粉碎
    本报讯　洛阳拖拉机厂全体职工向妄图煽动资本主义复辟的右派分子陈继善展开了说理斗争。陈继善是洛阳拖拉机厂总机械师，他极端地仇视党的领导，矢口否认我国的建设成绩。他把共产党比作一个无能的汽车司机，“似乎随时都可能翻车”。陈继善还说：“当前物资缺乏，是共产党和政府不善于经营企业，把人民的剩余价值浪费掉了的结果。”陈继善还具体地为民盟规定了四项反党反社会主义的纲领，其中最主要的是：第一，民盟必须和共产党分开，从共产党手中夺取一部分领导权，共产党应当把人民法院和监察机关交给各民主党派，他说只有这样，才能真正的达到互相监督。
    陈继善大肆宣扬美国资本主义经济的经营方式，并主张原封不动地把这种方式搬到我国。原来陈继善在解放前曾当过伪国民党第五集团军留美技术军官学员少将队队长，当过伪国防部工业动员司司长，现在他在美国银行里还有一万三千二百美元的存款，并在美国汽车公司里有股票。
