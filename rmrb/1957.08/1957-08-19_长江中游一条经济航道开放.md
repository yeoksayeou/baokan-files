Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 18th: An important economic waterway in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River has officially opened. From late July, various tugboat convoys traveling on the main line of the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, after sailing upstream from Hankou to Chenglingji, no longer navigated upriver. Instead, they changed course southward into Dongting East Lake and then entered the Yangtze River downstream from Yichang along the Songzi River, which connects Dongting Lake and the Yangtze River. Because the Han-Yi, Han-Yu and other shipping lines under the Yangtze River Navigation Administration changed to this shortcut route, the upstream journey time has generally been shortened by one day, reducing the voyage by about 13% (approximately 49 kilometers). At the same time, because the water flow in this waterway is gentler, the speed of the ships is also faster than on the Yangtze River. The bureau estimates that this waterway can still be open for more than a month this year. Including the nearly one month that has already been open, it is estimated that the fleet can save the country more than 1,200 tons of coal and increase freight revenue by more than 400,000 yuan by using this waterway.

    长江中游一条经济航道开放
    据新华社武汉18日电  长江中游一条重要的经济航道正式开放了。从7月下旬起，行驶在长江中游干线的各种拖驳船队自汉口上驶至城陵矶以后就不再溯江上航，而改道向南驶入洞庭东湖，再沿着连贯洞庭湖和长江的松滋河进入宜昌以下的长江江面。长江航运管理局所属汉宜、汉渝等线船队因为改走这条捷近航道，上航时间普遍缩短了一天，缩短航程13％左右（约四十九公里）。同时，因为这条航道的水流较缓，船的航速也比走长江快。这个局预计今年这条航道还可以开放一个多月，连同已经开放的近一个月在内，预计船队因为走这条航道可以为国家节约煤一千二百多吨，增加运费收入四十多万元。
