    Vietnam's Ethnic Minorities

    Question: Please briefly introduce the situation of ethnic minorities in Vietnam.

    Answer: Vietnam has a total population of 23 million, with the Kinh (Vietnamese) people accounting for 87% of the national population. In addition, there are more than sixty ethnic minorities in Vietnam, with a total population of over three million, distributed across 60% of the country's total land area. Most of these ethnic minorities in the north came from China, while those in the south mostly came from Malaya.

    The Kinh people are concentrated in the Mekong River and Red River deltas, which are rich in rice. Other ethnic minorities mostly live scattered in the highlands and remote areas of northern and central Vietnam, and some also live mixed with the Kinh people. The Viet Bac Interzone in northeastern Vietnam is one of the main areas where ethnic minorities live, including the Zhuang (300,000), the largest ethnic group, and the Nong (224,000), as well as the Man, Ai, Zhai, Lolo, ?, Shanzi, Gaolan, Miao, and Guizhou peoples. More than 20 ethnic groups, including the Thai, Muong, and She, live in northwestern Vietnam. The ethnic minorities in these two regions are all engaged in agricultural production. The Moi tribes living in central Vietnam, and the Cham tribes living in south-central and northern South Vietnam, mostly engage in hunting. Some ethnic minorities in Vietnam have very small populations, such as the Pa Yi and Man Ear, with total populations of no more than one hundred people.

    After the victory of the August Revolution in Vietnam in 1945, the people of all ethnic groups in Vietnam gained independence, freedom, and equality. In the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, ethnic minorities have thirty representatives.

    After the restoration of peace, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam decided to implement a policy of ethnic autonomy. In May 1955, the Thai-Miao Autonomous Region was established. In August 1956, the Viet Bac Autonomous Region was established. In recent years, the people of all ethnic minorities in Vietnam have made great progress in all aspects. As of June 1956, 25,496 ethnic minority cadres had been trained. (Attached photo)

    越南的少数民族
    问：请简单介绍越南少数民族的情况。
    答：越南全国人口共有二千三百万，京族（越南族）占全国人口的87％。此外，越南还有六十多个少数民族，人口共三百多万，分布在全国总面积60％的土地上。这些少数民族在北方的，多数来自中国，在南方的，多数来自马来亚。
    京族人民集中居住在盛产稻米的湄公河和红河两大三角洲上。其他少数民族多散居在越南北部和中部的高原山地和边远地区，也有一部分人和京族杂居。越南东北部的越北联区，是越南少数民族聚居的主要地区之一，其中有人口最多的僮族（三十万）和侬族（二十二万四千），还有曼族、艾族、寨族、儸儸族、?族、汕趾族、高兰族、苗族、贵州族等。越南西北部住着泰族、芒族、舍族等二十多个民族。这两个地区的少数民族都从事农业生产。在中越居住的摩依部落，在中越南部和南越北部居住的占人部落，多半从事狩猎。越南有些少数民族的人口很少，例如帕衣和蛮耳族，全族人数都超不过一百人。
    1945年，越南八月革命胜利后，越南各族人民获得了独立、自由、平等。在越南民主共和国的国会中，各少数民族有三十名代表。
    和平恢复后，越南民主共和国政府决定推行民族自治政策。1955年5月，成立泰族—苗族自治区。1956年8月，成立越北自治区。几年来，越南各少数民族人民在各方面都有很大的发展。截至1956年6月，已经培养出二万五千四百九十六名少数民族干部。（附图片）
