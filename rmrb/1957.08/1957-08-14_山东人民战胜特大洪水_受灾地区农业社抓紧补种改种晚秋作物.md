Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 13th. Reporter Song Jie reports: After a month of intense flood prevention efforts, the people of Shandong Province have conquered an extraordinary flood unseen in a century. Most of the 11,720 villages in the severely flooded Heze, Jining, and Linyi regions that were surrounded by water have now receded, and displaced residents are returning to their villages to resume production and rebuild their homes. Over 70% of the 27 million mu of farmland flooded in the province has receded. According to statistics from various regions, due to the early arrival and quick drainage of the flood this year, about 20% of the flooded farmland did not suffer damage; 22% of the farmland suffered minor damage and only requires replenishing some crops; the vast majority of the rest can also be converted to late autumn crops or sown with winter wheat.

In early and mid-July, Shandong Province experienced continuous torrential rains. The rainfall in Heze, Jining, Linyi and other southern regions reached more than 800 millimeters within half a month, and in some counties it even exceeded 1,000 millimeters. The Yi, Shu and other rivers and South Four Lakes overflowed and breached their banks; at the same time, the Yellow River experienced eight consecutive flood peaks, and the riverbed area was flooded, resulting in an extraordinary flood unseen in the province for a century.

After the flood formed, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Shandong Provincial People's Committee immediately held emergency meetings, and successively dispatched more than 20 leading cadres including the Deputy Governor, leading more than 530 cadres to personally go to the disaster areas to lead drainage and rescue work. Cadres from agencies, troops, and enterprises in the disaster-stricken areas also went all out, sharing weal and woe with the disaster victims, fighting day and night against the flood. During the tense period of flood prevention, the Central Flood Control Headquarters, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, Jiangsu and other provinces and cities successively dispatched 123 aircraft sorties, more than 530 ships and rubber boats, more than 110 amphibious vehicles and trucks, and transferred more than 1,400 engineering soldiers and technicians to the disaster areas to participate in the rescue, greatly strengthening the flood prevention forces and boosting the confidence of the people in the disaster areas to overcome the flood.

Now, agricultural cooperatives in various disaster-stricken areas are seizing the time to replenish and change to late autumn crops in the receding farmland, and strengthening field management.

    山东人民战胜特大洪水
    受灾地区农业社抓紧补种改种晚秋作物
    新华社济南13日电　新华社记者宋杰报道：经过一个月来紧张的防汛斗争，山东省人民已经战胜百年一遇的特大洪水。遭受水灾严重的菏泽、济宁、临沂等专区被水包围的一万一千七百二十个村庄，现在绝大部分已退水，外迁的灾民正陆续回乡生产，重建家园。全省被水淹没的二千七百万亩农田，已有70％以上退水。据各地统计，今年由于大水来得早，排得快，受淹农田中有20％左右未造成灾害；有22％的农田受灾轻微，只需补种部分作物；其余绝大部分也可以改种晚秋作物或播种冬小麦。
    7月上中旬，山东省连降暴雨，南部菏泽、济宁、临沂等专区在半月内降雨量达八百公厘以上，有的县竟达一千多公厘。沂、沭等河流和南四湖漫溢决口；同时黄河又连续出现八次洪峰，河床区洪水漫滩，因而造成了全省百年未有的特大洪水。
    洪水形成后，中共山东省委、山东省人民委员会立即召开紧急会议，先后抽调副省长等负责干部二十多人，带领五百三十多名干部，亲赴灾区领导排水和抢救工作。各受灾地区的机关、部队和企业部门的干部，也都全力以赴，与灾民共甘苦，同生死，日夜与洪水搏斗。在防汛紧张时期，中央防汛总指挥部、中国人民解放军和北京、上海、沈阳、江苏等省市先后派出一百二十三架次飞机，五百三十多只轮船、橡皮船，一百一十多辆水陆两用汽车、卡车，并抽调一千四百多名工程兵和技术人员亲赴灾区抢险，大大增强了防汛力量，鼓舞了灾区人民战胜洪水的信心。
    现在各受灾地区的农业社正抓紧在退水的农田里补种、改种晚秋作物，加强田间管理。
