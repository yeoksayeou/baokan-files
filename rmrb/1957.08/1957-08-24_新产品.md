　　X-ray Tube
　　The Nanjing Electron Tube Factory recently trial-produced two X-ray tubes and plans to mass-produce them in the fourth quarter.
　　The X-ray tube is a diode. The anode is cast with a tungsten plate on oxygen-free copper, and the pure tungsten filament of the cathode is placed in an iron focusing sleeve. When the X-ray tube is connected to a high-voltage current, high-speed electrons are shot onto the tungsten plate, emitting X-rays.
　　While trial-producing X-ray tubes, the Nanjing Electron Tube Factory also trial-produced a high-voltage rectifier tube. One sample tube produced was tested by a hospital in Nanjing with very good results. This rectifier tube can be installed on medical or industrial X-ray machines to convert high-voltage alternating current into direct current, which is then passed through the X-ray tube to emit X-rays.
      Fountain Pen Brush
　　Zhang Zhongkui, Luo Yaochu, Kuang Guangdi, and Yang Chengru, brush-making workers of the Majia'an Town Cultural Work Group in Lu'an County, Anhui Province, after a long period of research and trial production, successfully created a fountain pen brush. Each ink filling of this brush can write about 10,000 regular script small characters. When writing, the size of the characters and the thickness of the strokes can be controlled at will. The form of the pen is similar to a general fountain pen and is quite beautiful.
      Cheap Accordion
　　The Shanghai Local State-Owned Guoguang Harmonica Factory previously produced a button-type small accordion, which was priced at only about ten yuan and was very popular among the masses. Recently, in order to further meet the higher requirements of accordion enthusiasts, the factory, after designing and trial-producing various types, has decided to produce keyboard-type four-bass seventeen-key and eight-bass twenty-two-key accordions. The structure of these two types of accordions is the same as that of large accordions, and the tone is loud, and they can play general music. The four-bass has a range from C to E and sells for more than thirty yuan; the eight-bass has a range from G to E and sells for fifty to sixty yuan.

　　爱克斯光管
    南京电子管厂最近试制成两只爱克斯光管，准备第四季度成批生产。
    爱克斯光管是一个两极管。阳极用钨板浇铸在无氧铜上，阴极的纯钨丝放在铁的焦聚套内。当爱克斯光管接通高压电流，高速电子射到钨板上就发出爱克斯光射线。
    南京电子管厂在试制爱克斯光管的同时，还试制了一种高压整流管。做出的一只样管，经南京一个医院试用，效果很好。这种整流管装在医疗或工业用爱克斯光机上，可以把高压交流电变为直流电，然后通过爱克斯光管发出爱克斯射线。
      自来水毛笔
    安徽省六安县马家庵镇文工组的毛笔生产工人张忠魁、骆耀初、匡光第和杨成如，经过长时期的钻研试制，创造成功了一种自来水毛笔。这种毛笔每打一次墨汁，可以写一万个左右的正楷小字。书写起来，字迹大小、笔划粗细都能随心所欲。笔的形式跟一般自来水钢笔相似，相当美观。
      便宜的手风琴
    上海地方国营国光口琴厂前些日子曾经生产了一种钮键式小型手风琴，价格只有十元左右，颇受群众欢迎。最近，这个厂为了进一步满足手风琴爱好者的较高要求，经过多种类型的设计和试制，已经决定生产键盘式四倍司十七键和八倍司二十二键的手风琴两种。这两种手风琴结构与大型琴相同，音调宏亮，可演奏一般乐曲。四倍司的音域由C到E，售价三十余元；八倍司的音域由G到E，售价五十到六十余元。
