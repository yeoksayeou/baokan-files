Second Wide-Screen Cinema to Appear in Shanghai

According to research and measurements by a special team, Shanghai's "Great Light" Cinema is very suitable for conversion into a wide-screen cinema. As long as its existing stage surface is widened a bit, and certain soundproofing equipment is added, it can become a standard wide-screen cinema in terms of sound, lighting, and other aspects. The renovation work is much more convenient than the Capital Wide-Screen Cinema.

The machinery and equipment required for this wide-screen cinema will be imported from Democratic Germany. If the import work proceeds smoothly, this wide-screen cinema may open before the end of this year.

　  第二座宽银幕影院将在上海出现
    据专门小组研究、测量证明，上海“大光明”电影院是很适合改建为宽银幕影院的。只要把它现有的舞台面放宽一些，增加一定的隔音设备，在音响、光亮等方面都可以成为一个标准的宽银幕电影院，它比起首都宽银幕影院的改建工作还要方便得多。
    这个宽银幕影院所需用的机器设备将由民主德国进口。进口工作如能顺利进行，这个宽银幕影院可能提前在今年年内以前开幕。
