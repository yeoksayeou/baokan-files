    Remove the Anti-Japanese Cloak, Uncover the Deceptive Lid:
    Su Bingwen Was Originally a Japanese-Surrendering General

    (Our Newspaper News) Su Bingwen, who has consistently used the guise of an "Anti-Japanese General" to engage in rumor-mongering and swindling, has been recently exposed as a complete right-wing element.

    Su Bingwen was the Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), the Director of the Heilongjiang Provincial Sports Commission, and a member of the Provincial People's Committee. During the rectification movement, he made a series of reactionary remarks, proposing to abandon socialist construction and "choose roads according to people's different tastes." He maliciously said that the root of the "three evils" was "what the superiors do, the subordinates follow." He also demanded that "the Communist Party should change people."

    According to RCCK members and people who knew Su Bingwen's background, Su Bingwen had organized a small clique to attack the Party. The backbone members of this reactionary clique, Bai Wenqing, Pang Zhenxiang, Jia Wenqi, and Wang Gengcun, often got together to offer Su Bingwen ideas and make plans.

    According to reports, the so-called "Anti-Japanese General" Su Bingwen was actually a reactionary figure who feigned resistance to Japan while actually surrendering. After the "September 18th" Incident in 1931, Ma Zhanshan and others led troops to resist Japan at Jiangqiao in November. At that time, Su Bingwen was the commander of the Haikai Railway Protection and the commander of the Haiman Garrison, but he remained inactive and watched the success or failure of others. After Ma Zhanshan surrendered to the Japanese invaders, Su Bingwen also raised the flag of the puppet Manchukuo. When the Japanese invaders wantonly arrested and killed patriotic people in Manzhouli, Su Bingwen did not ask or care. When some patriotic soldiers launched uprisings, Su sent troops to pursue them, resulting in the annihilation of the uprising soldiers.

    It was not until September 1932, under the pressure of the broad masses and soldiers demanding resistance against Japan, coupled with the threat that the Japanese would take over his command, that Su Bingwen had no choice but to rise up against Japan. After the "uprising," he secretly released the Japanese consul Mi Sheng.

    During the Liberation War, Su Bingwen served as a Major General Counselor and Lieutenant General Counselor of the Kuomintang in Shenyang. He was captured by our army twice and released after education, but he still did not repent. At that time, under the Kuomintang rule in Shenyang, he published a statement entitled "Su Bingwen Escapes Danger" to show that he was determined to be an enemy of the people.

### 摘去抗日的幌子揭开骗人的盖子  苏炳文原来是降日将军

    摘去抗日的幌子揭开骗人的盖子
    苏炳文原来是降日将军
    本报讯　一贯以“抗日将军”作幌子进行招谣撞骗的苏炳文，根据最近揭露，是个十足的右派分子。
    苏炳文是民革黑龙江省委筹委会副主任委员、黑龙江省体育运动委员会主任和省人民委员会委员。在整风运动中，他发表了一系列的反动言论，他提出要放弃社会主义建设，“按照人们不同的口味去选择道路”。他恶意地说“三害”的根源是“上行下效”他还要求“共产党应该换一换人。”
    据民革成员和知道苏炳文底细的人揭露，苏炳文曾组织一个小集团向党进攻。这个反动小集团的骨干分子白文清、庞镇湘、贾文琦、汪耕村等人，经常在一起为苏炳文出主意、订计划。
    据揭发，所谓“抗日将军”苏炳文实际上是一个真投降假抗日的反动人物。1931年“九一八”事变后，马占山等人曾在11月间率领部队在江桥抗日，那时苏炳文是哈海护路司令和海满警备司令，但却按兵不动，坐观成败。当马占山投降日寇后，苏炳文也挂起了伪满洲国旗，当日寇到满洲里大肆捕杀爱国人士时，苏炳文也不闻不问。当有些爱国士兵举行起义时，苏就派大兵追击，结果起义士兵全军复没。
    直到1932年9月，在广大民众及官兵要求抗日的压力下，加上日本人要接管他的司令职务的威胁下，苏炳文才不得不起来抗日。“起义”以后，他还偷偷地把日本领事米胜放走。
    解放战争中，苏炳文在沈阳先后担任国民党的少将参议和中将参议，两次被我俘虏，经过教育以后释放，但他仍然不痛改前非，在当时国民党统治下的沈阳发表了一篇“苏炳文脱险”的声明，以表示他坚决同人民为敌。　（新华社专稿）
