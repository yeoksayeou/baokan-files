    Five Poems
    Zhu De
  Commemorating the August First Nanchang Uprising, the birth of a new army,
  Rejoicing that workers and peasants began to have their own soldiers.
  The revolutionary banner held high in our hands,
  Victory will ultimately belong to us.

  Joining Forces at Jinggangshan
  Revolutionary heroes converged at Jinggangshan,
  Concentrating strength made us even stronger;
  After the Red Army leadership improved,
  We solidified the battlefield by defeating five encirclements.

  Leaving Taihang
  The peaks of Taihang stand like walls,
  The natural barrier of the Yellow River stretches as far as the eye can see;
  Beacon fires burn red on both banks,
  This journey should comfort our common hatred.

  A Gift to the Elders of Sichuan
  The recovery of North China depends on heroes,
  Brave men sing songs of great wind like clouds.
  Confident that we can wave our spears and turn back the sun,
  The rivers and mountains remain, the battle flag is still red.

  To the Generals on the Southern Expedition
  Generals on the southern expedition are building magnificent achievements,
  Victory is entirely in hand.
  The Chinese traitor army is frightened like falling leaves,
  Our mighty army's morale surpasses the autumn wind.
  The autocratic regime sinks into dark clouds,
  The flag of liberation fills the land with red.
  The beautiful rivers and mountains are well restored,
  Ten thousand people will all be masters.

    诗五首
    朱德
  纪念八一南昌首义诞新军，喜庆工农始有兵。革命大旗撑在手，胜利终归属我们。
  井岗山会师革命雄师会井岗，集中力量更坚强；红军领导提高后，五破围攻固战场。
  出　太　行群峰壁立太行头，天险黄河一望收；两岸烽烟红似火，此行当可慰同仇。
  赠蜀中诸父老北华恢复赖群雄，猛士如云唱大风。自信挥戈能退日，河山依旧战旗红。
  寄南征诸将南征诸将建奇功胜算全操在掌中国贼军心惊落叶雄师士气胜秋风独裁政体沉云黑解放旌旗满地红锦绣河山收拾好万民尽作主人翁
