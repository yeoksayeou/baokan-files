Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, August 29th. Lou Guanguang, the main culprit in the murder of martyr Wang Xiaohe, was captured by the Zhuji County Public Security Bureau on August 25th.

　　Lou Guanguang was a counter-revolutionary ringleader with heinous crimes. Before liberation, he served successively as the Chief Prosecutor of the Kuomintang Jiangxi Provincial High Court and the President of the Kuomintang Gansu Provincial High Court, persecuting many revolutionary people. In 1948, as the presiding judge of the First Tribunal of the Kuomintang Central Special Criminal Court, he tried Wang Xiaohe, a Communist Party member in the Shanghai Electric Power Company, and executed Wang Xiaohe on the charge of "endangering the state."

Based on clues provided by the masses, the public security organs, after investigation, arrested him according to law.

    新华社杭州29日电　杀害王孝和烈士的主要凶手楼观光，于8月25日被诸暨县公安机关捕获。
    楼观光是一个罪恶重大的反革命罪魁。解放前先后担任江西省伪高等法院首席检察官、甘肃省伪高等法院院长，残害过不少革命人士。1948年任伪中央特种刑事法庭第一庭审判长时，曾审判过在上海电力公司的共产党员王孝和烈士，并加“危害国家”罪名把王孝和杀害。
    楼观光在1950年6月开始，就隐藏在自己家中楼上，从不露面，他的家属还有计划地在群众中散布楼观光已经逃亡的谣言。公安机关根据群众提供的线索，经过侦查，依法捕获了他。
