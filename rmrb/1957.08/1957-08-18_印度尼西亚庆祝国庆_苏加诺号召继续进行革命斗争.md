Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 17th: The Indonesian government held a grand ceremony in front of the Merdeka Palace in Jakarta this morning to celebrate the twelfth anniversary of Indonesia's independence.

President Sukarno delivered his customary National Day address to the people of the country in front of the Merdeka Palace. He also announced the beginning of the implementation of the New Life Movement he advocated.

Tens of thousands of people stood in the square in front of the Merdeka Palace to listen to the President's speech. Today, many representatives of workers and peasants were invited to the courtyard of the Merdeka Palace for the first time to participate in the celebration.

President Sukarno said in his National Day address that in the twelve years since Indonesia declared its independence, the people have not been able to live an ideal life, West Irian is still under Dutch rule, and the revolutionary struggle needs to continue.

Sukarno said that the Indonesian people originally wanted to build a solid country, but in the twelve years they have experienced seventeen cabinet changes and various military incidents, and this situation clearly needs to change.

Sukarno said that Indonesia is currently in a transitional phase, that is, transitioning from a colonial state to an independent national state. During this transition period, there are three basic issues that need to be resolved.

Sukarno said that the first issue is how to obtain construction funds. He said that the remnants of the Round Table Conference agreement must be quickly eliminated. This agreement has caused a large part of our construction funds to be sent abroad. On the other hand, funds should also be obtained by increasing the production of exports and restricting imports.

The second issue is how to cultivate construction cadres and talents as quickly as possible. The third issue is that we must find a political system that is suitable for the Indonesian national conditions. He said that the democracy currently practiced in Indonesia is not a political system suitable for the Indonesian national conditions, and it has made Indonesia even more fragmented. This democracy is licentious, without discipline, and without leadership.

Sukarno said that the error of the political system has caused Indonesia to face many crises, one of which is the crisis of democracy. He revealed that some people are demanding dictatorship and engaging in military committees.

Sukarno said that he hopes to correct the practice of completely copying foreign current political systems, and to realize a guided, disciplined, and mutually cooperative democracy that conforms to the basic life of the Indonesian nation. He hopes that the Constituent Assembly can consider solving the problem from this perspective.

Sukarno said that the establishment of the National Council is a constitutional and temporary preparatory work before the establishment of a fixed political system.

Speaking of the issue of local autonomy, Sukarno emphasized that autonomy that does not conform to the law and does not put the country first will inevitably endanger the integrity of the country.

    印度尼西亚庆祝国庆
    苏加诺号召继续进行革命斗争
    据新华社雅加达17日电  今天上午，印度尼西亚政府在雅加达独立宫的前面举行了庆祝印度尼西亚独立十二周年的隆重仪式。
    苏加诺总统站在独立宫前向全国人民发表了例行的国庆演说。他并且宣布他所倡导的新生活运动开始推行。
    成千成万的人民群众站在独立宫前的广场上听了总统的演说。今天还有许多工人和农民的代表第一次被邀请到独立宫的院子里参加了庆祝仪式。
    苏加诺总统在国庆演说中说，印度尼西亚宣告独立以后的十二年来，人民还不能过理想的生活，西伊里安还在荷兰的统治下，还需要继续进行革命斗争。
    苏加诺说，印度尼西亚人民原来想建设一个巩固的国家，但是十二年来却经历了十七次的内阁变动和种种的军队事变，这种情况显然需要来一个改变。
    苏加诺说，印度尼西亚目前正处在一个过渡阶段，即从殖民地状态过渡到独立民族的状态。在这个过渡时期，有三个基本问题需要解决。
    苏加诺说，第一个问题就是如何取得建设资金。他说，必须迅速肃清圆桌会议协定的残余。这个协定已经使我们一大部分的建设资金被送到国外去。另一方面，也应该通过增加输出品的生产和限制输入等办法来取得资金。
    第二个问题是如何尽速地培养建设干部和人材。第三个问题是必须寻找适合印度尼西亚民族情况的政治制度。他说，印度尼西亚现在所实行的民主不是适合印度尼西亚民族情况的政治制度，它已经使印度尼西亚变得更加分崩离析。这种民主是放纵的、没有纪律和领导的民主。
    苏加诺说，政治制度的错误已经使印度尼西亚目前面临许多危机，其中之一就是民主的危机。他揭露，有人要求独裁和搞军事委员会。
    苏加诺说，他希望纠正完全抄袭外国的现行政治制度的作法，而实现有领导的、有纪律的和符合印度尼西亚民族生活基础的互助合作的民主。他希望制宪议会能从这个角度来考虑解决问题。
    苏加诺说，民族委员会的成立是在设立一个固定的政治制度之前的一种符合宪法的暂时性准备工作。
    在谈到地方自治问题时，苏加诺强调说，不合法律和不以国家为重的自治必然会危害国家的完整。
