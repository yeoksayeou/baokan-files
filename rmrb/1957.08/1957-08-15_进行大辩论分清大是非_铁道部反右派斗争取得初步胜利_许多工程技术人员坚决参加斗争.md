    Our Newspaper Reports: The anti-Rightist struggle among the staff and workers of the Ministry of Railways has achieved a preliminary victory.

    During the Great Blooming and Contending, the Rightist elements exposed in the Ministry of Railways include Du Zhenyuan, a counselor in the Counselor's Office; Wang Yuqi, an editor and reviewer at the People's Railway Publishing House; Wang Maocai, a translator at the Expert Studio; and Fan Sifu, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the People's Railway News.

    Du Zhenyuan's anti-communist remarks echoed those of Chu Anping. Just as Chu Anping slandered the people's world as "the Party's world," Du Zhenyuan said that the eight years since liberation had been a "period of political tutelage," with "the Party replacing the government." He tried hard to sow discord between the Party and engineering and technical personnel, saying that Communist Party members "played the role of plainclothes police" and that the Communist Party adopted a "policy of utilization" towards intellectuals, "doing so out of necessity." He angrily denounced, "What could be worse than Communist Party members being blinded by victory and harming the Party and the people?" He openly stated, "I feel unhappy when I see the faces of Party members, and I find their voices disgusting." Du Zhenyuan's anti-communism was not accidental. Originally, Du Zhenyuan was a politician-engineer who had established connections with Kuomintang secret agents while studying in the United States. After returning to China, he immediately relied on the CC Clique and the Political Science Clique, serving as the director of the Railway Administration for more than twenty years and even climbing to the position of Kuomintang Central Committee Alternate Member. He colluded with secret agents on the Yuehan Railway to arrest progressive youth and suppress workers, and the workers still clearly remember these criminal acts.

    The Rightist element Wang Yuqi often liked to use the saying "Once the birds are gone, the good bow is put away" to slander the Communist Party. He angrily denounced, "The Communist Party is as thin as paper and turns against people without recognizing them." He vehemently advocated treating the Party's rectification in a stormy manner, saying, "The universities in Shanghai and Beijing are making a lot of noise. We must have great democracy when necessary."

    The Rightist element Wang Maocai, during the rectification, maliciously described the relationship between the Party and the masses as "guests of honor and prisoners" and "the cleaver and the fish." He openly declared, "I have political desires, and I must live a political life. If I am not allowed to progress, I will become reactionary." Originally, Wang Maocai was trusted by the Japanese invaders during their occupation of Northeast China and was listed as a "high-level Manchu." After Japan surrendered, he was appreciated by Kuomintang reactionaries and recommended as a member of the Nenjiang Provincial Party Committee and concurrently as the director of the Railway Police Guard. Wang Maocai was very nostalgic for the past, saying that the Communist Party was "not as good as the old Japanese."

    At the beginning of the rectification, the Party Committee of the Ministry of Railways invited senior intellectuals to several forums, listened to many useful opinions. Because Rightist elements took the opportunity to attack, the forums developed into debates. Originally, more than 60 people participated in the forums, but later it expanded to more than 200 people, and more than 6,000 people indirectly participated in the forums through wired broadcasting each time. During the debates, the masses' awareness generally improved. Many people who had once resonated with the fallacies of the Rightist elements also drew a line between themselves and the Rightist elements after the debates. Some engineering and technical personnel who had worked with the Rightist elements for many years also resolutely participated in the anti-Rightist struggle. Many engineering and technical personnel used their personal experiences to prove the correctness and necessity of the Party's leadership, as well as the Party's emphasis and care for technical personnel. Many engineering and technical personnel conducted detailed analysis and research on reactionary remarks. In the debates, they were able to target reactionary viewpoints, present facts, explain the truth, and refute the lies and slanders of the Rightist elements.

### 进行大辩论分清大是非  铁道部反右派斗争取得初步胜利  许多工程技术人员坚决参加斗争

    进行大辩论分清大是非
    铁道部反右派斗争取得初步胜利
    许多工程技术人员坚决参加斗争
    本报讯　铁道部机关职工的反右派斗争已经取得了初步胜利。
    在大鸣大放中，铁道部暴露出来的右派分子有参事室的参事杜镇远，人民铁道出版社的编审王余杞，专家工作室的翻译王茂才，人民铁道报副总编辑范四夫等人。
    杜镇远的反共言论同储安平一个声调，储安平污蔑人民的天下是“党天下”，而杜镇远则说解放八年来是“训政时期”，“以党代政”，他极力挑拨党和工程技术人员的关系，说共产党员“起了便衣警察的作用”，共产党对知识分子采取“利用政策”，“不得已而为之”。他大骂“共产党员胜利冲昏头脑，危害党与人民孰有甚于此者”。他公开表示“看到党员的面孔就不乐，听到党员的声音就可恶”。杜镇远的反共不是偶然的，原来杜镇远是个政客工程师，早在美国留学时期，就和国民党特务接上关系，回国以后，即投靠CC和政学系，当了二十多年的铁路管理局长，并且还爬上了国民党的中央候补委员的地位，在粤汉铁路勾结特务逮捕进步青年，镇压工人，现在工人们还清楚地记得他这些罪恶行为。
    右派分子王余杞经常喜欢用“飞鸟尽、良弓藏”的话来污蔑共产党，他大骂“共产党人情薄如纸，翻脸不认人，”他极力主张用狂风暴雨的方式对待党的整风，说什么“上海、北京各大学闹得很凶，我们必要时还得来个大民主”。
    右派分子王茂才在整风中，恶意地把党群关系说成是“座上客与阶下囚”“刀俎与鱼肉”。他公开宣布：“我有政治欲，政治生活我一定要过，不叫我进步，我就反动”。原来王茂才在日寇侵占东北时期，曾得日寇信任，列为“高等满人”，日本投降以后，又为国民党反动分子所赏识，被推荐为嫩江省党部委员，兼铁路警护处长等职。王茂才十分留恋过去，说共产党还“不如老日本”。
    在整风开始的时候，铁道部党组邀请高级知识分子进行了几次座谈，听取了很多有益的意见。由于右派分子乘机进攻，座谈会就发展为辩论会，原来参加座谈的六十余人，后来扩展到两百多人，经有线广播每次间接参加座谈的有六千多人。在辩论中群众觉悟普遍提高，不少人曾经对右派分子的谬论表示共鸣，经过辩论也和右派分子划清了界限，有些与右派分子共事多年的工程技术人员，也坚决参加了反右派的斗争。许多工程技术人员以亲身经历，证明党领导的正确和必要，以及党对技术人员的重视和关怀。许多工程技术人员对反动言论进行细致的分析研究工作，在论战中都能针对反动观点，摆出事实、说清道理，驳斥右派分子的谎言和污蔑。
