Rightist Faces Fully Exposed, Mass Awareness Universally Raised
Beijing Normal University Achieves Major Victory in Anti-Rightist Struggle

(Our Dispatch) On the evening of the 8th, He Xilin, Secretary of the Beijing Normal University Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, delivered a report to the entire faculty, students, and staff on the anti-Rightist struggle. He first discussed the handling of opinions raised by the masses during the rectification campaign and how Rightists took advantage of the rectification opportunity to launch a frenzied attack against the Party.

Accepting Correct Criticism to Improve Work

He Xilin said that over the past three months, the University Party Committee extensively solicited opinions from the masses and fully promoted democracy. To help the Party rectify its work, the broad masses raised many valuable opinions and sharp criticisms regarding the leadership of the Party Committee and various aspects of work over the past few years, most of which were correct. These opinions greatly helped to further strengthen the Party's leadership, expand democratic life, improve work, and run the Normal University well.

Regarding the opinions raised by the masses, the Party Committee researched, processed, and responded to a total of 207 large and small issues. Every effort was made to address those that should be addressed and could be addressed. The Party Committee also made preliminary self-criticisms of shortcomings in leadership style. A small portion of the opinions and criticisms raised by the masses were incorrect. The general situation was: first, the demands were too high or too urgent; second, there was a lack of understanding of the situation; and third, there were errors in understanding issues, such as insufficient understanding of the situation, leading to one-sided opinions. Although these opinions were incorrect, they were well-intentioned, so we still welcomed them, except for some necessary explanations and persuasion.

Rightist Elements Launch a Frenzied Attack Against the Party

However, Rightists with ulterior motives took the opportunity to stir up trouble, fanning the flames everywhere and launching a frenzied attack against the Party. Rightist elements disagreed with the Party Committee's step-by-step rectification from top to bottom, as instructed by the Central Committee, and were not satisfied with the small-scale symposiums that allowed the masses to speak freely. They opposed gentle breezes and fine rain, and opposed well-intentioned criticism. Rightist element Tao Dayong shouted as early as early May: "The University Party Committee is not letting go," saying that "outside, the thunder is deafening, but there is no wind or rain at the University." Rightist elements Mu Mutian, Hu Ming, Chen Yousong, and others repeatedly said, "When you rectify others, it is a violent storm, but today when you rectify yourselves, you use gentle breezes and fine rain," thereby creating a tense situation. Faced with this situation, the University Party Committee firmly implemented the Central Committee's policy of "opening wide." During this period, Rightist elements did as they pleased, using all forms and occasions, seizing every issue, exaggerating and distorting it, turning it into a weapon to attack the Party and drive the Party from power. At this time, large and small Rightist elements all came forward.

The Rightist elements took advantage of the rectification opportunity to attack the Party, starting with the following fundamental issues:

First, negating the great achievements of the socialist revolution and socialist construction. On this issue, Rightist element Mu Mutian, nicknamed the "owl" by the masses, fired the shameful "first shot," after which other Rightist elements followed suit, making a great fuss. Rightist element Wu Zhaofa, who was stubborn to the end and alienated himself from the people, said: "One cannot say that the Three-Anti, Five-Anti, ideological remolding, and suppression of counter-revolutionaries were great." Rightist element Dong Weichuan described the Three-Anti, Five-Anti, and ideological remolding as "lining up for a bath, being scalded until the skin peeled and flesh was torn." Rightist element Zhu Qixian, a die-hard, insisted that "masters, guests, servants, and slaves" existed in the current society, saying that the result of the past movements was to make people "dare not be angry, dare not speak," and that "now is the darkest era in the history of Chinese education."

Rightist elements also negated the achievements in teaching reform and scientific research. Rightist element Chen Yousong believed that all the shortcomings and errors in education work in recent years were caused by "implementing the unchanging policy of learning from the Soviet Union." He also described the criticism of Dewey as "dragging him out of the Meridian Gate for execution," as "name-calling," and as "taking things out of context."

Second, inciting discord between the Party and the masses, opposing the ideological remolding of intellectuals, and distorting the Party's policy toward intellectuals. Rightist element Fu Zhongsun said that we treat intellectuals as "using them while scolding them," Rightist element Huang Yaomian said that Beijing was implementing a "policy of utilization, restriction, and remolding," and Chen Yousong said that professors in the new society were like "tutors in ancient Greece."

Third, slandering the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement and fundamentally opposing the people's democratic dictatorship system. Rightist elements seized on certain shortcomings and errors in the small-group struggle stage of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement at the University, maliciously exaggerating and distorting them, clamoring that "not a single counter-revolutionary was struggled against correctly," saying that "the sins of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries were serious, and the achievements were inevitable."

Fourth, attempting to discredit and overthrow the Party organization and usurp the Party's leadership over institutions of higher learning. Rightist elements attacked the Party with all sorts of dirty words. They especially targeted the core of the Party's leadership at the University—the University Party Committee—fabricating rumors and slandering them, and assigning all sorts of large and small crimes to all the leading comrades of the Party Committee.

Rightist elements such as Tao Dayong, under the direction of the Zhang-Luo alliance, put forward the so-called "democratic administration of the school" plan in order to overthrow the Party Committee and replace it with themselves.

During the Rightists' attack on the Party, individual Party members betrayed the Party and defected to the enemy, supplying ammunition to the Rightist elements, cooperating from within and without, and playing an extremely negative role. For example, Peng Hui, a Party member in the Chinese Department, and Zhou Zhiliang, Deputy Secretary of the Communist Youth League Committee, supported and cooperated with the Rightists during their frenzied attack, attacking the Party. Although there were few Rightists within the Party, their influence was very bad. Under their activities, the masses' thinking became more confused, and the Rightists' attack became more rampant.

A small number of Rightist elements also appeared in the Communist Youth League. The backbone members of "Voices from the Bottom" and "Bitter Medicine" were mostly Communist Youth League members, and their anti-Party and anti-socialist actions were incompatible with the title of Communist Youth League member.

Exposing the Rightists Squeezed Out the Pus

Under the solemn denunciation of the broad masses of teachers and students, monsters and demons revealed their true colors one by one. Exposing the Rightists squeezed out the pus. Currently, 130 Rightist elements, large and small, have been exposed and criticized. Their backgrounds and the political situations of their families are very complex. Many came from families of capitalists, landlords, rich peasants, and old bureaucrats. Some had direct relatives who were suppressed or subjected to control. It is no accident that these Rightist elements were so hostile and hateful towards the Party and socialism; they had their class base and political stance.

Currently, there are several situations among the Rightist elements who have been struggled against: 1. Die-hard elements who are still stubbornly resisting and refusing to repent. If these people do not repent, they will isolate themselves from the people. 2. Attempting to muddle through and not making a thorough confession. These people must immediately change their attitude, pull back from the brink, turn back to the shore, honestly make confessions, and bow their heads to the people to admit their guilt. Muddling through will not work. 3. Beginning to show some transformation and showing signs of repentance for their anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds. 4. Having a certain degree of transformation and being willing to bow their heads to the people to admit their guilt. We welcome the latter two types of people. Currently, many Rightist elements have chosen the path of being willing to repent and start anew. We believe that this is the only way out for Rightist elements, and we hope that all Rightist elements can make a decisive decision and make a choice.

Our struggle against the Rightist elements has adopted the method of reasoned struggle, convincing people with reason. Rightist elements are generally very cunning, always adopting an attitude of evasion and denial towards the anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks they have spread and the anti-Party and anti-socialist activities they have carried out. Under repeated exposure and criticism in large and small meetings and in school publications and big-character posters, they were finally forced to bow their heads and admit their guilt and surrender when they were at a loss for words.

Is it a good thing or a bad thing that so many Rightist elements have appeared at the University? From the phenomenon, it seems to be a bad thing, but from the long-term interests of socialism, it is mainly a good thing. Because:

First, the Rightist elements have been exposed, and their anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks and actions have been exposed and criticized by the broad masses, eliminating their influence and clarifying major issues of right and wrong, which is a profound education for us.

Second, some people worry and say: "After criticizing so many Rightist elements, won't it be difficult to work in the future?" On the contrary, exposing and criticizing Rightist elements is not only not detrimental to work, but greatly beneficial to work. In the past, Rightist elements in various specific work positions always confronted the Party and hindered the implementation of the Party's policies. Facts have shown that we cannot rely on Rightist elements to run socialist institutions of higher learning well.

Third, criticizing Rightist elements is more conducive to unity. At the same time, the anti-Rightist struggle also purifies the ranks of the Party and the League.

Masses Improve Their Awareness and a Large Number of Activists Emerge

Through the anti-Rightist struggle, the socialist awareness of the broad masses has generally improved. Their political sensitivity has become sharper, their relationship with the Party has become closer, they do not believe in but hate the reactionary remarks and actions of the Rightist elements, and they are willing to fight against the Rightist elements under the leadership of the Party. Some people say: "The anti-Rightist struggle not only criticized the reactionary remarks and actions of the Rightist elements, but also clarified many of my own muddled thoughts." The improvement of the ideological awareness of the broad masses is the greatest gain of this struggle. Now, we have basically drawn a clear line between ourselves and the Rightist elements on some fundamental issues. Everyone unanimously recognizes that the achievements of the socialist revolution and socialist construction are primary, that we must take the socialist road, that we must have the leadership of the Communist Party, that we must implement the people's democratic dictatorship, and that we must implement democratic centralism.

In this complex and sharp political and ideological struggle, the University has seen the emergence of a large number of activists and fighting backbone who support the Party and socialism. They are clear-headed and have a relatively firm stand. Because these activists and fighting backbone have grown up in battle, they are all conscious and have strong combat effectiveness. They are scattered among the broad masses of new and old teachers, staff, and students. In criticizing and exposing the reactionary remarks and actions of the Rightist elements, they have expressed many vivid and powerful correct remarks and written many persuasive articles. Under the leadership of the Party, they maturely used the method of reasoned struggle and convincing people with reason. Moreover, they are also good at organizing and mobilizing the masses and uniting the masses. This group of activists and excellent backbone is the reliable force and positive factor for the University to continue to carry out the anti-Rightist struggle and run the University well in the future. At the same time, they are also the foundation for us to cultivate a more mature theoretical team. For these people, we must continue to improve their socialist awareness, we must promote them to better connect with the masses, and we must help them to more firmly stand on the position of the working class.

What to Do in the Future?

Finally, Comrade He Xilin talked about the future tasks of the University. He said that through this anti-Rightist struggle, we have clearly realized that in order to run a socialist university well, first, we must establish the Party's strong leadership over institutions of higher learning, strengthen ideological and political education, strengthen teaching work, scientific research work, and cultivate new forces, and ensure the realization of the Party's policies. Strengthen the leadership of the Communist Youth League, democratic parties, trade unions, and student unions. The Party must further carry out rectification in depth, conscientiously overcome the shortcomings of subjectivism, sectarianism, and bureaucratism, improve work, and rectify ideological style.

Second, intellectuals must continue to carry out ideological remolding in depth.

Young students and intellectuals must also continue to carry out ideological remolding in depth in their studies and lives, fully absorb the experiences and lessons of the rectification and anti-Rightist struggle, establish the idea of combining with workers and peasants and serving workers and peasants, thoroughly eliminate the ideological style and habits brought from the landlords, bourgeoisie, and the old society, overcome individualism, and cultivate their organization and discipline.

Third, through this rectification and anti-Rightist struggle, we must create an atmosphere in the school that has both centralization and democracy, both discipline and freedom, and both unified will and individual ease of mind.

Fourth, strengthen unity on a new basis. We will work together with the broad masses of teachers, students, and staff to run Beijing Normal University as a socialist university and to cultivate more and better-quality people's teachers who serve the people wholeheartedly for the country.

### 右派面目充分暴露　群众觉悟普遍提高  北京师大反右派斗争获重大胜利

    右派面目充分暴露　群众觉悟普遍提高
    北京师大反右派斗争获重大胜利
    本报讯　8日晚，中共北京师范大学委员会书记何锡麟，向全校师生员工作了关于反右派斗争的报告。他首先谈到在整风当中对于群众提出的意见的处理情况，以及右派分子如何利用整风的机会向党进行猖狂的进攻。
    接受正确的批评改进工作
    何锡麟说，三个月来，师大党委广泛征求群众意见，充分发扬了民主。广大群众为了帮助党整风，对党委的领导以及几年来各方面的工作，提出了很多宝贵的意见和尖锐的批评，这些意见绝大部分都是正确的，对进一步加强党的领导，扩大民主生活，改进工作，办好师范大学有很大帮助。
    对于群众提出的意见，经过党委研究加以处理和答复的大大小小的问题共二百零七条。其中应该做到而且能够做到的都已尽力做了。党委对领导作风上的缺点也曾作了初步检查。群众提出的意见和批评中也有一小部分是不正确的。大致的情况：一是要求过高过急；二是不了解情况；三是认识问题有错误，如情况了解不够，意见带有片面性。这些意见虽然不正确，但都是善意的，所以我们除作一些必要的解释和说服外，仍然是欢迎的。右派分子向党疯狂进攻
    但是，别有用心的右派分子却乘机兴风作浪，到处煽风点火，向党展开了猖狂的进攻。右派分子不同意党委按照中央的指示从上而下有步骤地进行整风，也不满足于那种便于群众畅所欲言的小型座谈会的形式，他们反对和风细雨，反对善意的批评。右派分子陶大镛在5月初就大嚷：“师大党委不放手”，说什么“外面雷声震耳，师大无风无雨”。右派分子穆木天、胡明、陈友松等也一再说“你们整人家是狂风暴雨，今天整自己改用和风细雨了”，从而制造紧张局势。面对这种情况，师大党委坚定不移地执行了中央大鸣大放的方针。在这一段日子里，右派分子为所欲为，利用一切形式，一切场合，抓住每一个问题，加以夸大歪曲，使之变成向党进攻的武器，赶党下台。这时，大小右派分子一个个都出头露面了。
    右派分子利用整风机会向党进攻，是从以下几个根本性的问题入手的。
    一、否定社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大成绩。在这个问题上，被群众喻之为猫头鹰的右派分子穆木天，放出了可耻的“第一枪”之后，其他右派分子也就紧跟着大作文章。顽固到底、自绝于人民的右派分子武兆发说：“不能说三反、五反、思想改造、肃反是伟大的”。右派分子董渭川把三反、五反、思想改造说成是“排队洗澡，被烫的皮开肉烂”。右派分子的死硬派朱启贤，硬说现在的社会中存在着“主人、客人、仆人和奴隶”，说历次运动的结果是使人“不敢怒、不敢言”，“现在是中国教育史上最黑暗的时代”。
    右派分子也否定教学改革和科学研究工作上的成绩。右派分子陈友松认为几年来教育工作的一切缺点错误都是由于“贯彻学习苏联这一不变的方针”造成的。他还把对杜威的批判说成是“推出午门斩首”，是“骂街”、是“断章取义”。
    二、挑拨党群关系，反对知识分子思想改造，歪曲党的知识分子政策。右派分子傅种孙说我们对待知识分子是“打着用、骂着使”，右派分子黄药眠说在北京执行的是“利用、限制、改造政策”，陈友松则说新社会的教授就好像“古希腊的教仆”。
    三、污蔑肃反运动，从根本上反对人民民主专政制度。右派分子抓住师大肃反运动中小组斗争阶段的某些缺点和错误，恶意的加以夸大和歪曲，叫嚣“肃反没有一个斗对的”，说什么“肃反罪恶是严重的，成绩是不可避免的”。
    四、力图搞臭、搞垮党组织，篡夺党对高等学校的领导权。右派分子用一切肮脏字眼攻击党。对于师大党的领导核心——师大党委，更是捕风捉影搜罗罪状，极尽造谣诽谤的能事，把所有的党委领导同志都给安上大大小小的罪名。
    右派分子陶大镛等为了把党委打垮，由他们取而代之，他们在章罗联盟的指使下，提出了所谓“民主办校”的方案。
    在右派向党进攻期间，个别党员叛变投敌，给右派分子输送子弹，里应外合，内外夹攻，起了极其恶劣的作用。如中文系党员彭慧，团委副书记周之良在右派猖狂进攻期间，支持和配合右派，向党进攻。党内右派人数虽少，但影响很坏。在他们的活动下，群众思想更加混乱，右派的进攻就更加猖狂起来了。
    在共产主义青年团中也出现了少数右派分子，“底层之声”和“苦药”的骨干分子大都是共青团员，他们的反党反社会主义行动和共产主义青年团团员称号是不相容的。
    揭发了右派挤出了脓疮
    在广大师生严正的声讨下，魑魅魍魉，牛鬼蛇神，一一现出原形。揭发了右派，挤出了脓疮。现被揭发和批驳的大大小小的右派分子有一百三十人，他们的出身和家庭的政治情况非常复杂。许多人出身于资本家、地主、富农、旧官僚的家庭。有的直系亲属被镇压被管制。这些右派分子之所以对党对社会主义如此敌视，如此仇恨，并不是偶然的，而是有着他们的阶级基础和政治立场的。
    目前，已被斗争的右派分子中，存在着下面几种情况：1、死硬分子，至今执迷不悟，继续顽抗。这些人如再不憣然悔悟，必将自绝于人民。2、企图蒙混过关，不作彻底交代。这些人必须立即改变态度，悬崖勒马，回头是岸，老老实实作出交代，低头向人民认罪，蒙混是过不了关的。3、开始有所转变，对他们的反党反社会主义的言行有悔改的表现。4、有一定程度的转变，愿意向人民低头认罪。对于后面所说的两种人我们是欢迎的，目前有不少的右派分子已经选择了愿意悔过自新的道路。我们认为这是右派分子唯一的出路，希望所有的右派分子能够当机立断，作出抉择。
    我们对右派分子的斗争，是采取了说理斗争、以理服人的方法。右派分子一般都是很狡猾的，他们对自己所散布的反党反社会主义的言论和所进行的反党反社会主义活动总是采取回避、抵赖的态度，在大会、小会、校刊、大字报的反复揭发批判下，最后在理屈词穷时才不得不低头认罪，被迫投降。
    师大出现这么多右派分子，是好事还是坏事呢？从现象看似乎是坏事，但是就社会主义的长远利益说，主要是好事。因为：
    第一，右派分子暴露了出来，他们的反党、反社会主义的言论和行动，被广大群众揭发了、批判了，消除了它们的影响，辨明了大是大非，对我们是一次深刻的教育。
    第二，有人担心说：“批判了这么多右派分子，以后工作不是不好作了吗？”恰好相反，揭露、批判了右派分子，不仅不是不利于工作，而是大大有利于工作。过去右派分子在各个具体的工作岗位上，总是与党对抗，阻碍党的方针、政策的贯彻。事实表明，不能依靠右派分子办好社会主义的高等学校。
    第三，批判了右派分子，更利于团结。同时，通过反右派斗争，也纯洁了党、团的队伍。
    群众提高了觉悟出现大批积极分子
    经过反右派斗争，广大群众的社会主义觉悟普遍地有所提高。他们的政治嗅觉灵敏了，和党的关系更加靠拢了，他们对右派分子的反动言行不是相信而是十分憎恨了，并且愿意在党的领导下与右派分子进行斗争。有人说：“反右派斗争不仅批判了右派分子的反动言行，而且，同时也澄清了自己的许多糊涂思想。”广大群众思想觉悟的提高，是这次斗争的最大收获。现在，我们与右派分子在一些根本问题上已经基本上划清了界限。大家一致认识到，社会主义革命与社会主义建设成绩是主要的，要走社会主义道路，要共产党领导，要实行人民民主专政，要实行民主集中制。
    在这场复杂尖锐的政治斗争和思想斗争中，师大涌现了大批拥护党、拥护社会主义的积极分子和斗争骨干，他们头脑清醒，立场较为坚定。这些积极分子和斗争骨干由于是在战斗中成长起来的，因此都是有觉悟，有较强的战斗力的同志。他们散布在广大的新老教师、职工和学生中间。在批判和揭露右派分子的反动言行上，他们发表了不少生动有力的正确言论，写出了不少具有说服力的文章。在党的领导下，他们成熟地运用了说理斗争、以理服人的方法。而且，他们也善于组织动员群众，团结群众。这批积极分子和优秀骨干，是师大今后继续进行反右派斗争和办好师大的依靠力量和积极因素，同时，也是我们培养一支较为成熟的理论队伍的基础。对于这些人，必须继续提高他们的社会主义觉悟，必须推动他们更好地联系群众，帮助他们更加坚定地站稳工人阶级的立场。
    今后怎样做？
    最后，何锡麟同志讲到了师大今后的工作任务。他说，通过此次反右派斗争，我们明确认识到，为了办好社会主义的大学，第一，必须树立党对高等学校的坚强领导，加强思想政治教育；加强教学工作、科学研究工作、培养新生力量，保证党的方针政策的实现。加强对共青团、民主党派、工会、学生会的领导。党必须进一步深入地进行整风，认真克服主观主义、宗派主义、官僚主义的缺点，改进工作，整顿思想作风。
    第二、知识分子必须继续深入地进行思想改造。
    青年学生知识分子也要在学习和生活中继续进行深入的思想改造，充分吸取整风和反右派斗争中的经验教训，树立与工农结合、为工农服务的思想，要彻底地清除从地主、资产阶级以及从旧社会带来的思想作风和习气，克服个人主义，培养他们的组织性和纪律性。
    第三、通过这次整风和反右派斗争，在校内要造成这样一种风气，又有集中，又有民主，又有纪律，又有自由，又有统一意志，又有个人心情的舒畅。
    第四、在新的基础上加强团结。我们将和广大师生员工一起，为办好社会主义的北京师范大学，为国家培养出数量更多、质量更高的、全心全意为人民服务的人民教师而共同奋斗。
