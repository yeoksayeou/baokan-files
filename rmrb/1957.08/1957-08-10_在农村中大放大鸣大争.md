Our countryside has basically achieved cooperativization, but the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads is not yet over. In order to consolidate the socialist position and overcome capitalist tendencies, it is currently necessary to conduct a large-scale socialist education campaign among the entire rural population.

Since the second half of 1955, tremendous changes have taken place in China's countryside. Hundreds of millions of farmers eagerly joined advanced agricultural cooperatives and immediately launched a production upsurge, increasing grain production by 15 billion jin in a year of major disasters. At the end of last year and the beginning of this year, although a very small number of people withdrew from the cooperatives, even more people joined. These facts irrefutably demonstrate that Chinese farmers are willing to take the socialist road, and the socialist transformation of agriculture has achieved great success.

However, it must not be assumed that agricultural cooperatives will be consolidated as soon as they are established. This idea does not conform to the laws of development. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in his report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "The growth of any new thing is bound to go through difficult and tortuous paths. In socialist construction, the idea of achieving success easily and smoothly without going through hardships and setbacks or making great efforts is nothing but fantasy." Cooperatives are undergoing a gradual process of consolidation, and this process will still require a considerable amount of time.

In the process of gradually consolidating cooperatives, it is necessary to conduct struggles simultaneously on the economic front and the political and ideological front. On the economic front, it is necessary to continuously develop agricultural and rural sideline production, gradually realize the technical transformation of agriculture, and correctly solve the problem of distribution, so as to gradually increase the income of cooperative members. On the political and ideological front, it is necessary to educate the vast majority of cooperative members to love the socialist motherland, love the collective cause of the cooperative, constantly raise their socialist consciousness, fundamentally get rid of the influence of capitalism, and actively struggle against bad elements who undermine socialism. In the year or so since the basic realization of agricultural cooperation throughout the country, rural workers in various places have generally paid more attention to the economic front, while work on the political and ideological front has clearly lagged behind. Many rural workers and rural Party organizations seem to believe that after the task of cooperation has been basically completed, there is no longer a struggle between the socialist road and the capitalist road in the countryside, and therefore they have relaxed their political and ideological work.

This idea is completely wrong. They have forgotten these teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work, especially during the period when the socio-economic system undergoes fundamental changes... A brand-new social system must be built on the base of the old system, and it must clear this base. The remnants of old ideas reflecting the old system always remain in people's minds for a long time and are unwilling to retreat easily. After the establishment of cooperatives, many struggles must be gone through before they can be consolidated. After consolidation, they may collapse again if we relax our efforts." "The capitalist tendency among well-to-do peasants is serious. As long as we slightly relax our political work among the peasants in the cooperative movement, and even for a long period thereafter, the capitalist tendency will run rampant." (See the editor's notes to "Serious Lessons" and "We Must Wage a Resolute Struggle Against Capitalist Tendencies" in the book "The Socialist Upsurge in the Chinese Countryside").

This is precisely the case. In places where the ideological struggle between socialism and capitalism has been suspended or weakened, anti-socialist forces have raised their heads and carried out rampant activities.

It must not be forgotten that the landlords and rich peasants in the countryside are still being reformed. To transform these people from thought to action into socialist laborers is undoubtedly a long-term task. This transformation has been effective. However, some landlords and rich peasants, together with other bad elements, are still waiting for opportunities to oppose cooperativization, oppose unified purchase and sales, provoke the relationship between workers and peasants, and disrupt social order. During the period of the bourgeois rightists' frantic attack on socialism before early June this year, in some rural areas, some landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries who adhered to their reactionary stand took the opportunity to intimidate peasants, beat up cadres, and even openly attempted to settle old scores. It is clear that if we do not resolutely strike against these bad elements, we will never be able to build socialism in the countryside.

The majority of well-to-do middle peasants are willing to take the socialist road together with the poor and lower-middle peasants. They voluntarily joined the cooperatives, but many of them are "following the crowd" and do not have sufficient consciousness. After actually participating in collective production activities and income distribution, they inevitably feel that their long-standing old habits are in conflict with the new system. In the early stages of agricultural cooperatives, production and income are generally difficult to reach the original level of some well-to-do middle peasants in a short period of time. The difficulties that all new economic systems encounter, such as insufficient material resources and lack of experience, are also inevitable in newly established agricultural cooperatives. Even if the production of the cooperative increases significantly, it is not easy to handle the relationship between people in the cooperative well in a short period of time. As a result, some well-to-do middle peasants feel "restricted" or "disadvantaged" in the cooperative. When dealing with the relationship between the state, the cooperative, and individual cooperative members, a small number of well-to-do middle peasants have played a negative role. A small number of well-to-do middle peasants with serious capitalist ideas disregard collective and national interests, conceal output, engage in commercial speculation, undermine unified purchase and sales, and spread erroneous remarks in the cooperative, undermining internal unity, damaging public property, hindering labor discipline, and even instigating cooperative members to withdraw from the cooperative. The activities of a small number of well-to-do middle peasants in these aspects objectively helped the destructive activities of some landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries. For the general well-to-do middle peasants, we must, of course, consolidate our unity with them economically and politically. However, if someone insists on making mistakes and deliberately undermines the interests of the state and the cooperative, then we must launch a struggle of reasoning against these very few people and thoroughly refute their capitalist ideas. If we do not systematically explain the facts, clarify right and wrong, promote justice, and suppress evil, we will not achieve the goal of unity.

The vast majority of rural Party members and cadres are loyally striving for the socialist cause. They are leaders supported by the broad masses of peasants. However, some rural Party members and cadres, including some county-level workers, have not recognized the situation of class struggle in the countryside, and have not resolutely safeguarded the principles of socialism. These comrades have mistakenly taken the stand of individualism and departmentalism on major issues that are closely related to the fate of socialism, such as the grain issue. Some comrades have taken a laissez-faire attitude towards the behavior of bad elements who endanger rural order and undermine the socialist legal system, and have not given them the necessary blows in a timely manner.

These facts show that although the cooperation movement has achieved great success, the struggle between the new and the old is by no means something that can be resolved in a year or two, and the capitalist tendencies in the countryside still have an influence that cannot be ignored. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to conduct a large-scale socialist education among the entire rural population, criticize right-leaning ideas, individualism, and departmentalism within the Party, criticize the capitalist ideas of certain well-to-do middle peasants, and crack down on the counter-revolutionary behavior of landlords, rich peasants, and other bad elements who attempt to attack socialism. This is an inevitable major political struggle and ideological struggle in the countryside. It should also be understood that this is a long-term struggle task, and it is by no means possible to solve the problem by conducting it only once. Such a large-scale socialist education should be conducted once a year. Otherwise, there will be no thorough victory of the socialist revolution in the countryside, no smooth development of socialist agriculture, and no increasing consolidation of the cooperative system.

How should this struggle be carried out? Existing experience has proven that the best way is to unfold a mass debate in the countryside, including individual households, with leadership and planning, that is, to implement "great unleashing, great airing of views, and great debate" in the countryside. First of all, the problems in the actual life of the countryside should be exposed, and various different opinions should be expressed. Then, the good ones should be chosen and followed, and the bad ones should be criticized, that is, a resolute and full struggle of reasoning should be carried out to solve problems and improve work. Some people believe that this method of great debate can be adopted in relatively high-level organs and schools, but cannot be adopted in the countryside. This is a manifestation of a lack of trust in the Party's leadership and the wisdom of the basic masses. According to the experience of Yuci, Xiangfen, Hongzhao and many other places in Shanxi, under the joint leadership of the working group of the higher-level Party committee and the rural grassroots organization, the method of great debate can also be adopted in the countryside, and only by adopting this method can problems be solved most effectively.

What issues should be debated? According to the current situation in rural areas, the issues related to the superiority of cooperatives, the unified purchase and sale of grain and other agricultural products, the relationship between urban and rural workers and peasants, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and compliance with the legal system are particularly in need of clarification in the minds of the peasant masses and rural workers. Therefore, these four aspects of the problem especially need to be put forward for debate.

Before the autumn harvest, the debate should first focus on the issue of unified purchase and sale of grain and other agricultural products. This is the issue that the masses are most concerned about at present, and it is also an issue that must be resolved first in order to smoothly complete this year's unified purchase and sale task. Every grassroots cadre and peasant must understand that whether to complete the grain unified purchase task 100%, strictly control grain sales, and conscientiously save grain consumption is essentially a question of whether to take the socialist road or not, and whether to love the country or not. The development of agricultural production and cooperativization is not only for the benefit of the peasants, but also for the benefit of the entire people and for the benefit of the socialist motherland. At no time should the individual and local interests be placed in opposition to the overall interests of the country. One of the most acute problems currently occurring in the countryside is that some backward elements are putting their personal interests in a position opposed to the interests of the entire people. For their personal interests, they demand that the state purchase less grain and sell more. If less is purchased and more is sold, what will fill the gap? What will be used to supply the grain needs of the urban population, the population of industrial and mining areas, and the army? What will be used to supply the grain needs of peasants in disaster areas, peasants in economic crop areas, and peasants who lack grain? When everyone needs to save grain to build socialism, how can the peasants, who make up the largest majority of the population, not take the lead in saving grain? They think these are matters for the state, and they don't care. But if everyone is so selfish, can we still build socialism? Without a socialist motherland, without the national socialist construction, can there still be agricultural development and the happiness of the peasants? Obviously not. Therefore, the debate on the grain issue is not only of decisive significance for the grain work immediately following the autumn harvest, but also of decisive significance for establishing the idea that love of country, love of the collective, and love of family must be unified, and for establishing the idea of building the country industriously and thriftily, running cooperatives industriously and thriftily, and managing households industriously and thriftily.

In the great debate on other issues, it is also necessary to closely focus on this central purpose: to educate the peasant masses and rural cadres to understand the unity of national interests, collective interests, and individual interests, and to understand the necessity of building the country industriously and thriftily, running cooperatives industriously and thriftily, and managing households industriously and thriftily.

On whatever issue, there must be full confidence: trust the Party, trust the masses. The vast majority of peasant masses have a flesh-and-blood relationship with our Party. They are willing to listen to the Communist Party and follow the Communist Party forever. In this great debate, as long as we strengthen leadership, rely on grassroots organizations and activists among the masses, adhere to the class line of relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants and uniting with the middle peasants, adhere to the policy of correctly handling contradictions among the people through reasoning, and adhere to the policy that counter-revolutionaries must be suppressed and bad elements must be cracked down on, we will definitely be able to defeat capitalist ideas in the countryside and make the socialist system more consolidated.

### 在农村中大放大鸣大争

    在农村中大放大鸣大争
    我国农村已经基本上实现了合作化，但是社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争还没有结束。为了巩固社会主义的阵地，克服资本主义的倾向，在目前有必要向全体农村人口进行一次大规模的社会主义教育。
    1955年下半年以来，我国农村发生了翻天覆地的大变化。几亿农民争先恐后地加入了高级农业社，并且随即掀起了生产高潮，在大灾之年增产粮食一百五十亿斤。在去年年底和今年年初，虽然有极少数人退社，同时却有更多的人入社。这些事实无可辩驳地说明：我国农民是愿意走社会主义道路的；农业社会主义改造已经得到伟大的成就。
    但是决不能认为农业社一成立就会巩固起来。这种想法是不符合事物发展的规律的。毛泽东同志在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告中已经指出：“任何新生事物的成长都是要经过艰难曲折的。在社会主义事业中，要想不经过艰难曲折，不付出极大努力，总是一帆风顺，容易得到成功，这种想法，只是幻想。”合作社正在经历一个逐步巩固的过程，这个过程还需要一段相当长的时间。
    在合作社逐步巩固的过程中，需要同时在经济战线上和政治思想战线上进行斗争。在经济战线上，要不断地发展农业和农村副业的生产，逐步地实现农业的技术改造，并且正确地解决分配问题，使社员的收入逐步增加。在政治和思想战线上，要教育绝大多数社员热爱社会主义祖国，热爱合作社的集体事业，不断地提高社会主义觉悟，从根本上摆脱资本主义的影响，并且积极地同破坏社会主义的坏分子作斗争。在全国基本实现农业合作化以后这一年多期间，各地农村工作人员对于经济战线一般比较重视，而在政治和思想战线上，工作却显然落后了，许多农村工作人员和农村的党组织似乎认为，在合作化的任务基本完成以后，农村中再没有社会主义道路和资本主义道路的斗争了，因而放松了政治上和思想上的工作。
    这种想法是完全错误的。他们忘记了毛泽东同志的这些教导：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线，在社会经济制度发生根本变革的时期，尤其是这样。……一个崭新的社会制度要从旧制度的基地上建立起来，它就必须清除这个基地。反映旧制度的旧思想的残余，总是长期地留在人们的头脑里，不愿意轻易地退走的。合作社建立以后，还必须经过许多的斗争，才能使自己巩固起来。巩固了以后，只要一松劲，又可能垮台。”“富裕农民中的资本主义倾向是严重的。只要我们在合作化运动中，乃至以后一个很长的时期内，稍微放松了对于农民的政治工作，资本主义倾向就会泛滥起来。”（见“中国农村的社会主义高潮”一书中“严重的教训”和“必须对资本主义倾向作坚决的斗争”两文的按语）
    事实正是这样。在社会主义对资本主义的思想斗争中止了或者削弱了的地方，反社会主义的力量就抬起头来，大肆活动起来了。
    不能忘记，农村中的地主分子和富农分子还正在被改造，要使这些人从思想到行动都变成社会主义的劳动者，无疑是一个长时期的任务。这个改造已经收到效果。但是一部分地主分子、富农分子同别的坏分子在一起，仍然在等待时机，反对合作化，反对统购统销，挑拨工农关系，扰乱社会秩序。今年6月上旬以前资产阶级右派向社会主义猖狂进攻期间，在一些农村里，就有一些坚持反动立场的原地主、富农分子和反革命分子，乘机而起，恫吓农民，殴打干部，甚至公然企图倒算。很明显，如果对于这些坏分子不给以坚决的打击，我们决不能在农村中建设社会主义。
    富裕中农，多数是愿意同贫农、下中农一起走社会主义道路的。他们自愿地参加了合作社，可是许多人是“随大流”，并没有充分的自觉。实际参加了集体的生产活动和收益分配以后，他们不免感到自己多年养成的旧习惯同新制度有矛盾。农业社初办，生产和收入一般地一时还难于达到某些富裕中农原有的水平；一切新生的经济制度都会遭到的困难，如物力不足、经验不足等等，在新办的农业社里也是难免的。即使社里的生产显著地增加了，要把社里人同人之间的关系都处理得很妥善，也不是短时期容易做到的。于是，一部分富裕中农觉得在社里“受拘束”或者“吃亏了”。在处理国家、合作社、社员个人之间的关系问题的时候，少数富裕中农起了消极的作用。一小部分资本主义思想严重的富裕中农不顾集体利益和国家利益，隐瞒产量，从事商业投机，破坏统购统销，并且在合作社中散布错误言论，破坏社内团结，损害公共财物，妨碍劳动纪律，甚至鼓动社员退社。少数富裕中农在这些方面的活动，客观上助长了一些地主、富农、反革命分子的破坏活动。对于一般富裕中农，我们当然要从经济上和政治上巩固地团结他们。但是，如果有人坚持错误，蓄意破坏国家的利益和合作社的利益，那就必须对这极少数人展开说理斗争，把他们的资本主义思想彻底驳倒。如果不有系统地讲清事实，辩明是非，伸张正气，压倒邪气，就达不到团结的目的。
    大多数农村党员和干部是忠诚地为社会主义事业奋斗的，他们是广大农民所拥护的领导者。可是，有一部分农村党员和干部，包括一部分县级工作人员在内，没有认清农村中的阶级斗争的形势，没有坚决维护社会主义的原则。这些同志在对像粮食问题这样同社会主义的命运有极密切关系的重大问题上，错误地站到了个人主义、本位主义的立场上。有些同志，对于坏分子危害农村秩序、破坏社会主义法制的行为，采取了放任的态度，没有及时地给以应有的打击。　
    这些事实说明：尽管合作化运动已经取得了巨大的成就，但是新事物同旧事物的斗争决不是一年两年所能够解决的，农村中的资本主义倾向仍然有不容忽视的影响。因此，十分必要向全体农村人口进行一次大规模的社会主义教育，批判党内右倾思想和个人主义、本位主义思想，批判某些富裕中农的资本主义思想，打击企图向社会主义进攻的地主富农分子和别的坏分子的反革命行为。这是农村中的一场不可避免的重大的政治斗争和思想斗争。还要了解，这是一个长时期的斗争任务，决不是只进行这一次就可以解决问题的。这样的大规模的社会主义教育应该每年进行一次。不然，就谈不上社会主义革命在农村中的彻底胜利，谈不上社会主义农业的顺利发展，谈不上合作社制度的日益巩固。
    这场斗争应该怎样进行呢？已有的经验证明：最好的方式就是有领导有计划地在农村中，包括单干户在内的全体人口中，展开群众性的大辩论，也就是在农村中实行“大放大鸣大争”。首先，把农村现实生活中的问题都揭露出来，让各种不同的意见都发表出来，然后，择其善者而从之，其不善者批判之，也就是坚决地充分地进行说理斗争，解决问题，改进工作。有人认为，这种大辩论的方式，在比较高级的机关里和学校里可以采用，在农村不能采用。这是对于党的领导的力量和基本群众的智慧缺乏信任的表现。根据山西榆次、襄汾、洪赵等地和其他许多地方的经验，在上级党委的工作组和农村基层组织的共同领导下，在农村中同样可以采用大辩论的方式，而且只有采用这种方式才能最有效地解决问题。
    辩论一些什么问题呢？根据目前各地农村情况看来，有关合作社的优越性、粮食和其他农产品的统购统销、城乡工农关系、肃反和遵守法制这四个方面的问题，在农民群众和农村工作人员的思想上特别需要澄清。因此，这四个方面的问题特别需要摆出来辩论。
    在秋收以前，辩论应该首先集中在粮食和其他农产品的统购统销问题上。这是当前群众最关心的一个问题，也是为了顺利地完成今年统购统销任务必须首先解决的一个问题。要使每个基层干部和农民都懂得：是否百分之百地完成粮食统购任务、严格地控制粮食销量和认真地节约粮食消费的问题，实质上也就是走不走社会主义道路的问题，爱国不爱国的问题。农业生产的发展和合作化，不仅是为了农民的利益，而且是为了全体人民的利益，为了社会主义祖国的利益。任何时候，都不允许把个人的局部的利益同国家的整体的利益对立起来。目前在农村里发生的一个最尖锐的问题，正是一部分落后分子把个人利益放到了同全体人民的利益对立的地位。他们为了个人的利益，要求国家对粮食少购多销。收购的少，销售的多，拿什么填这个窟窿呢？拿什么去供应城市人口、工矿区人口和军队的粮食需要呢？拿什么去供应灾区农民、经济作物区农民和缺粮农民的粮食需要呢？当人人都需要节约粮食来建设社会主义的时候，占人口最大多数的农民怎么能够不带头节约粮食呢？他们认为这些是国家的事，他们不管。但是如果大家像这样自私自利，还能不能建设社会主义呢？没有社会主义的祖国，没有全国的社会主义建设，还能不能有农业的发展和农民的幸福呢？显然是不能够的。因此，粮食问题的辩论不但对于紧接着秋收的粮食工作有决定的意义，而且对于树立爱国爱社爱家必须统一的思想，对于树立勤俭建国、勤俭办社、勤俭持家的思想，有决定的意义。
    在别的几个问题的大辩论中，也要紧密地围绕着这个中心目的：教育农民群众和农村干部了解国家利益、集体利益、个人利益的一致性，懂得勤俭建国、勤俭办社、勤俭持家的必要性。
    在无论什么问题上，都要有充分的信心：信任党、信任群众。绝大多数农民群众同我们的党有血肉一般的联系。他们是愿意听共产党的话，永远跟着共产党走的。在这次大辩论中，只要加强领导，依靠基层组织和群众中的积极分子，坚持依靠贫农下中农、团结中农的阶级路线，坚持用说理方法正确处理人民内部矛盾的方针，坚持反革命必须肃清、坏分子必须打击的方针，一定能把农村中的资本主义思想斗垮，使社会主义制度更加巩固。
