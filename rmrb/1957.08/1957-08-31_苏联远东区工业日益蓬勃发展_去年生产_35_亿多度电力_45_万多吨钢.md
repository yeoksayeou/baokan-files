　　Soviet Far East Industry is Increasingly Thriving
　 Last Year it Produced More Than 3.5 Billion Kilowatt-Hours of Electricity and More Than 450,000 Tons of Steel
    Moscow Dispatch, August 28th: The Soviet Far East has established a huge industry during the years of socialist construction. Tarasov, Director of the Economics Department of the Far Eastern Branch of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, said: In 1956 alone, the Far East produced more than 3.5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, 278,000 tons of steel, 173,000 tons of steel products, 727,000 tons of cement, 150,000 tons of paper, 17.3 million tons of coal, 16.9 million cubic meters of timber, and a considerable amount of oil, natural gas, and non-ferrous metals. The railway has increased by 2,100 kilometers compared to the pre-war period. Many places continue to be developed. Many new enterprises are being built in the upper reaches of the Iman River, the Olga district of the Primorsky Krai, the coast of the Sea of ​​Okhotsk, the northern part of Sakhalin Island, and so on.
    Tarasov said: The branch is formulating the comprehensive development of the Far East's productive forces. The branch, together with other scientific and geological institutions, is studying the composition and distribution of minerals along the Heilongjiang River and the coast. After the research, it will be possible to rationally solve the major task of creating a steel industry in the Far East.
    Tarasov believes: Sino-Soviet cooperation to build a steel plant based on the coking coal of Northeast China and the iron ore of the Soviet Far East will be the most economical solution. After the Far East has steel, steel does not have to be transported from the west, and the freight alone will save more than one billion rubles a year. Chemists are studying local raw materials and their refining problems. The Far East plan for developing the productive forces of the entire Heilongjiang River Basin will be formulated in 1960 with the cooperation of scientists from China and the Soviet Union. Biologists are very interested in the research on ginseng and soybeans. These two plants have great development prospects in the Heilongjiang River Basin.
    Economists have already listed the benefits of establishing a unified power system in the southern Far East. Tarasov said: The branch should become the largest scientific research institution in the Far East in a few years. (Attached picture)

　　苏联远东区工业日益蓬勃发展
　  去年生产35亿多度电力45万多吨钢
    本报莫斯科28日电　苏联远东区在社会主义建设年份已经建立了巨大的工业。苏联科学院远东分院经济部主任塔拉索夫说：仅在1956年远东生产了三十五亿多度电力、二十七万八千吨钢、十七万三千吨钢材、七十二万七千吨水泥、十五万吨纸、一千七百三十万吨煤、一千六百九十万立方公尺木材、许多石油、天然气、有色金属。铁路比战前增加了二千一百公里。许多地方继续在开发。许多新的企业在伊曼河上游、滨海州的奥尔金区、鄂霍次海岸、库页岛北部等等地方兴建。
    塔拉索夫说：分院正在制订综合发展远东生产力问题。分院和其他科学和地质机关一起研究黑龙江沿岸和沿海矿物的构成和分布规律。研究以后将能合理解决在远东创立钢铁工业的重大任务。
    塔拉索夫认为：中苏合作，以中国东北的焦炭和苏联远东的铁矿石为基础建设钢铁工厂将是最经济的方案。远东有钢铁以后，钢铁不必从西部运来，仅仅运费一年就节约十亿卢布以上。化学家正在研究地方原料及其制炼问题。远东有生产硫酸、硼酸等酸类资源。整个黑龙江流域发展生产力的远东计划，在中苏两国科学家合作之下，将于1960年制订。生物学家对于人参和大豆的研究甚感兴趣。这两种植物在黑龙江流域是大有发展前途的。
    经济学家已经列出在远东南部建立统一的电力系统的益处。塔拉索夫说：分院在几年内应该成为远东最大的科学研究机关。（附图片）
