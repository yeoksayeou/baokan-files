Xinhua News Agency, 7th. Many university graduates in the capital have expressed their firm obedience to state allocation.

After Premier Zhou Enlai and Mayor Peng Zhen gave reports to university graduates in the capital, graduates from various universities held discussions. Graduates from Tsinghua University expressed that their responsibility is to build a socialist society together with workers and farmers, and they are determined to contribute their strength to the cause of socialist construction. All the members of the Communist Youth League in the Fourth Grade, Class Two of the Mining Construction Department of the Beijing Mining Institute recently wrote a letter to Premier Zhou Enlai and Mayor Peng Zhen, requesting that they be sent to the most difficult places to be tempered. They said that the needs of the motherland are their greatest aspirations, and they are determined to work in the mines and open up the road to underground treasures in the border areas to extract coal.

Many graduates said at the forums that after two months of the anti-rightist struggle, they have raised their ideological awareness and criticized the erroneous arguments of so-called opening up the "free market." All the graduates of the fourth grade of the Department of Oriental Languages of Peking University wrote in a letter to Premier Zhou Enlai and Mayor Peng Zhen that they do not want the "free market" and are unwilling to be "commodities."

Before the start of the anti-rightist struggle, graduates of various universities had filled out their applications once. At that time, most people's aspirations were inclined to engage in scientific research and to work in big cities. Recently, many graduates from various universities have requested to modify their applications. They felt that the previous applications were more for personal considerations and less from the needs of the country, and they did not have enough of the spirit of being the masters of the country. Now they are asking to go to factories, mines and other places to work.

    首都许多高等学校毕业生表示
    服从国家分配不要“自由市场”
    新华社7日讯　首都许多高等学校毕业生表示坚决服从国家分配。
    周恩来总理和彭真市长向首都高等学校毕业生作了报告以后，各院校的毕业生都开会讨论。清华大学的毕业生表示：他们的责任就是和工人、农民在一起建设社会主义社会，他们决心为社会主义建设事业贡献出自己的力量。北京矿业学院矿井建设系四年级二班的全体共青团员最近给周恩来总理和彭真市长写信，要求派他们到最困难的地方去锻炼。他们说祖国的需要就是他们的最大志愿，他们决心到矿山去工作，到边疆去打开通向地下宝库的道路，取出煤炭来。
    许多毕业生在座谈会上谈到，经过两个月来反右派斗争后，提高了思想认识，批判了所谓开放“自由市场”的错误论调。北京大学东语系四年级全体毕业生写给周恩来总理和彭真市长的信上说，他们不要“自由市场”，不愿意作“商品”。
    在反右派斗争开始以前，各院校的毕业生曾经填写过一次志愿，当时大部分人的志愿偏重于作科学研究工作，偏重于在大城市里工作。最近各院校的毕业生中已有很多人要求修改志愿。他们感到以前填的志愿，为个人打算多，从国家需要考虑得少，作国家主人翁的气魄不足，现在纷纷要求到工厂、矿山等地去工作。
