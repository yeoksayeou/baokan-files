    Modernized Breeding Farm

    A modernized breeding farm was recently completed on the Hulunbuir Grassland.

    Construction of the Xiertala Breeding Farm began in late August of last year, with a construction area of more than 5,000 square meters, including six buildings such as dairy cow sheds, calf pens, birthing rooms, feed mixing rooms, and treatment rooms. The two dairy cow sheds and one calf pen can accommodate 358 cattle and are completely modern buildings. An artificial insemination station will also be built soon.

    This breeding farm specializes in cultivating the famous Sanhe cattle, supplying various pastoral areas.

    现代化种牛场
    一座现代化种牛场最近在呼伦贝尔草原上建成。
    谢尔塔拉种牛场是去年8月下旬动工兴建的，建筑面积有五千多平方公尺，包括乳牛舍、犊?、产房、调料室、治疗室等六栋建筑。两栋乳牛舍和一栋犊牛舍可以容纳三百五十八头牛，完全是现代化建筑。不久还要建筑一栋人工授精所。
    这座种牛场专门培育著名全国的三河牛，供应各地牧区。
