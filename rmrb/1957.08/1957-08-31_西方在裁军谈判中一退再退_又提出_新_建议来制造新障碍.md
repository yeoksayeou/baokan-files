    Western Countries Retreat Again and Again in Disarmament Negotiations
    Again Putting Forward “New” Suggestions to Create New Obstacles
    Our Newspaper London, August 29th, special dispatch (reporter Pan Fei): Disarmament negotiations have been going on for more than five months, and the group meetings have been held sixty-six times. But until today, people not only do not see any signs of reaching an agreement in the negotiations, but Western countries are going backwards, bringing more difficulties to the resolution of the disarmament issue.
    At the meeting on August 29th, Western countries put forward a so-called "new" proposal; in essence, they set new obstacles for the disarmament negotiations.
    In the past, Western countries suggested that the reduction of conventional armaments be carried out in three stages, and the second and third stages of reduction would depend on the resolution of political issues. In this "new" proposal, in addition to repeating the resolution of political issues, they also put forward two prerequisites: that the provisions stipulated in the convention are implemented satisfactorily; and that other major countries accept restrictions on their armed forces. What is the standard of "satisfactory"? Western countries did not talk about it. This is like the Maitreya Buddha's "Universe Bag" in the Investiture of the Gods, which can be large or small, depending on the situation—it is entirely up to the Western countries to interpret it arbitrarily. What does "other countries..." mean? Western countries did not talk about it. The problem is that if Adenauer does not agree to reduce troops, the United States will have a "reason" to refuse to reduce troops. Thus, the so-called reduction of conventional armaments in the Western proposal is essentially only reduced to the first stage level "US and Soviet Union 2.5 million, Britain and France 750,000." However, the current armed forces of the United States are 2.6 million, and Britain is less than 700,000. It can be seen that the "value" of the new proposal in this regard is equal to zero.
    In the past, Western countries suggested reducing military spending by 10%. The Soviet Union's suggestion was 50%. Even if these two numbers are far apart, it can at least be said that both sides have put forward their respective indicators, thus providing a basis for negotiation. In this "new" proposal, Western countries do not mention reducing military spending at all, but only require the contracting states to provide information on military budgets and annual expenditures to international supervisory organizations. This opens the door to the arms race.
    In the past, Western countries advocated that they have the right to use nuclear weapons in "defense" when attacked on a large scale. They are unwilling to destroy nuclear weapons because they dream of using nuclear weapons to "erase" Moscow, Beijing... from the map. However, they still hypocritically said that nuclear weapons are only used in "defensive" wars against large-scale attacks. In this "new" proposal, even this sentence has been deleted. At the same time, this proposal, like before, does not stipulate a ban on using currently stored fissile materials to produce nuclear weapons. It is worth noting that the British representative, Lord Noble, openly stated at the meeting that Western countries cannot give up nuclear weapons; they must rely on nuclear weapons. As a disarmament negotiator, Noble's发表 of such hawkish remarks cannot be regarded as a normal phenomenon in the work of the disarmament group.
    The Western countries' proposal on using aerial photography to prevent sudden attacks actually provides a guarantee for collecting reconnaissance intelligence. This proposal advocates opening up the territories of the Soviet Union and the United States for supervision, but it advocates keeping the US military bases in other countries' territories outside the scope of supervision.
    The head of the Soviet delegation, Zorin, made a preliminary analysis of the Western "new" proposal at today's meeting. He pointed out that whether on the issue of reducing conventional armaments or on the issue of nuclear weapons, Western countries are not taking a step forward, but taking a big step backward. The West has no intention of substantially reducing troops, no intention of reducing military spending (their real intention is to increase military spending), no intention of banning the production and destruction of nuclear weapons, and will use nuclear weapons without any restrictions. On the issue of a test ban, the West pretends to be willing to stop testing for two years, but in essence, it is not two years, but twelve months. Their purpose in doing so is to confuse public opinion. The "new" proposal evades the issues raised by the Soviet Union of eliminating overseas military bases and withdrawing overseas troops (especially in Germany). Finally, Zorin pointed out sharply: when Western countries put forward this proposal, they knew that it was impossible to serve as a basis for discussion and knew that it could not be accepted by the Soviet Union.
    Knowing it's impossible, but still pretending to put it forward, what are the Western countries' intentions? In a nutshell: they are determined to undermine the disarmament negotiations, but they dare not take responsibility for it.

### 西方在裁军谈判中一退再退　又提出“新”建议来制造新障碍

    西方在裁军谈判中一退再退
　　又提出“新”建议来制造新障碍
    本报伦敦29日专电　记者潘非报道：裁军谈判已进行了五个多月，小组会议已举行过六十六次。但直到今天，人们不但看不到谈判有达成协议的征兆，而且西方国家正大开倒车，为裁军问题的解决带来了更多的困难。
    在8月29日的会议上，西方国家提出了一个所谓“新”的建议；实质上，他们为裁军谈判设置了新的障碍。
    过去，西方国家建议常规军备的裁减分三个阶段进行，而第二、三阶段的裁减将取决于政治问题的解决。在这个“新”建议中，除了重复政治问题的解决之外，它们又提出了两个先决条件，即：公约上所规定的条款实施得令人满意；其他主要国家接受对它们武装部队的限制。所谓“满意”的标准是什么？西方国家没有谈。这就好像封神榜中弥陀佛的“乾坤袋”，可大可小，大小由之——它完全由西方国家来随意解释。“其他国家……”又意味着什么？西方国家没有谈。问题是，如果阿登纳不同意裁减部队，美国便有“理由”拒绝裁减。这样，西方建议中的所谓裁减常规军备，实质上只裁减到第一阶段水平“美苏二百五十万，英、法七十五万”。但是，美国目前的武装部队是二百六十万，英国还不到七十万。由此可见，新建议在这一点上的“价值”是等于零。
    过去，西方国家建议裁减军费10％。苏联的建议是50％。即使这两个数字有很大的距离，但至少可以说，双方都提出了各自的指标，从而有了作为谈判的基础。在这个“新”建议中，西方国家根本不提裁减军费，而只要求缔约国将军事预算和年度开支的情报提供给国际监督组织。这就给军备竞赛开了方便之门。
    过去，西方国家主张在遭到大规模进攻的时候，在进行“防御”的时候，有权使用核子武器。它们是不愿意销毁核子武器的，因为它们梦想着用核子武器把莫斯科、北京……从地图上“抹掉”。可是，它们毕竟还假惺惺地说，核子武器只使用于反对大规模进攻的“防御”战中。在这个“新”建议中，却连这样一句也被删掉了。同时，这个建议和以前一样，没有规定禁止用现已贮存的分裂物质来生产核武器。值得注意的是，英国代表诺布尔公然在会上声称，西方国家不能放弃核武器；它们必须依赖于核武器。诺布尔作为裁军谈判代表而发表这样的好战言论，这决不能认为是裁军小组工作中的正常现象。
    西方国家关于用空中摄影来防止突然袭击的建议，实际上是为搜集侦察情报提供了保证。这个建议主张开放苏联和美国的领土以便进行监督，但是却主张使美国在别国领土上的军事基地处于监督范围以外。
    苏联代表团团长佐林，在今天会议上对西方“新”建议作了初步的分析。他指出，不论在裁减常规军备问题上，在核武器问题上，西方国家不是向前跨进一步，而是向后倒退一大步。西方无意于大量裁减部队，无意于削减军费（它们的真实意图是要增加军费），无意于禁止生产和销毁核武器，并将毫无约束地使用核武器。在停试问题上，西方假装愿意停试两年，实质上并非两年，而是十二个月。他们这样作的目的，是要迷惑舆论。“新”建议回避了苏联提出的销除海外军事基地和撤退海外驻军（特别在德国）问题。最后，佐林一针见血地指出：西方国家提出这个建议的时候，明知道是要可能作为讨论的基础的，明知道是不能为苏联所接受的。
    明知不能，而又偏偏装模作样地提出来，西方国家居心何在？一言以蔽之：它们决心破坏裁军谈判，而又不敢担当这一责任。
