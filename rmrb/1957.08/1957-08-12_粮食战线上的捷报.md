    Good News from the Grain Front
    Hubei Farmers Deliver Early Rice
    Having basically completed the summer grain purchase task, many agricultural cooperatives in Hubei Province have begun to deliver early rice to the state. In the past half month, state grain departments have purchased more than 38 million jin of early rice in the Huanggang, Xiaogan, and Jingzhou special districts. The amount of early rice entering the market in various places is gradually increasing.
    The quality of the early rice entering the warehouses is good, with plump grains and few impurities.
    Yunnan Purchases Over Half of Grain for Storage
    In Yunnan Province, 67% of the grain has been put into storage. The Xiaochun grain purchase task for Simao Special District was 5 million jin, and the actual completion was 5.76 million jin. The task for Lincang Special District was 7.5 million jin, and the actual completion was 8.01 million jin. The main reasons these two special districts completed their tasks well and quickly are that the Party committees at all levels attached importance to the grain purchase and storage work and to conducting socialist education among the peasants.
    Fujian Sees Daily Increase in Grain Purchases
    As of August 5th, Fujian Province had stored 350 million jin of purchased grain (42% of the summer purchase task). Currently, the province is averaging 10 million jin of purchases per day, an increase of more than 4 million jin compared to the average in mid-July.
    Farmers in Five Counties in Zhejiang Lead in Selling Grain
    After the launch of the socialist propaganda movement in the vast rural areas of Zhejiang, a surge in delivering public grain and selling surplus grain has initially formed. According to statistics from the Provincial Grain Bureau, the average daily grain purchase in the province has increased from more than 6 million jin in late July to more than 30 million jin. As of August 5th, the province had stored more than 210 million jin of grain. The grain purchase work in Zhuji, Pingyang, Huangyan, Wenling, and Yuyao counties is far ahead of the rest of the province.
    Guangdong Reverses Delayed Purchase Situation
    In Guangdong Province, the recent socialist propaganda and education campaign in rural areas has begun to reverse the delayed summer grain purchase situation. As of August 2nd, the amount of grain stored in the province accounted for 44% of the planned figure. The special districts of Foshan, Gaoyao, Zhanjiang, and Shantou, and the Hainan area have completed 50% to 57% of their purchase plans. In Hepu and Gaoyao special districts, a high tide of grain delivery to storage has formed. Deqing County has already completed its task. Luoding, Xinxing, Yunfu, Gaoyao and other counties have also completed more than 82% of their tasks. In Taishan County, Foshan Special District, the completion of public grain storage has rapidly increased from 50% to over 90% in recent days.

    粮食战线上的捷报
    湖北农民交售早稻
    已经基本完成夏粮征购任务的湖北省，许多农业社又开始把早稻交售给国家。近半个月来，国家粮食部门在黄冈、孝感、荆州三个专区共收购了早稻三千八百多万斤。各地早稻的上市量正在逐渐增加。
    入库的早稻质量良好，谷粒饱满，杂质较少。
    云南征购粮入仓过半
    云南省粮食入库已达67％，思茅专区小春征购任务为五百万斤，实际完成为五百七十六万斤，临沧专区任务为七百五十万斤，实际完成八百零一万斤。这两个专区所以完成得比较好而快，主要是各级党委重视粮食征购入库工作，重视对农民进行社会主义教育工作。
    福建每天购粮数增加
    福建省到8月5日止，已入库征购粮食三亿五千万斤（占夏季征购任务42％）。目前全省平均每天征购一千万斤，比7月中旬平均每天增加了四百多万斤。
    浙江五县农民售粮领先
    浙江广大农村的社会主义宣传运动展开后，初步形成了交公粮、售余粮的热潮。据省粮食厅统计，现在全省平均每天征购粮食由7月下旬的六百多万斤增加到三千多万斤。到8月5日止，全省已入库粮食二亿一千多万斤。诸暨、平阳、黄岩、温岭、余姚五县征购工作在全省遥遥领先。
    广东征购迟滞现象扭转
    广东省各地农村在最近开展了社会主义宣传教育运动，夏季粮食征购工作迟滞局面已开始扭转。到8月2日止，全省入库粮食占计划数字44％。佛山、高要、湛江、汕头等专区和海南区完成征购计划50％到57％。合浦专区和高要专区，送粮入库已形成高潮。德庆县已经全部完成任务。罗定、新兴、云浮、高要等县亦已完成任务82％以上。佛山专区台山县，最近几天完成入库公粮已由50％迅速增加到90％以上。
