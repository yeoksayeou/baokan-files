　　Real Grain Shortage or Fake Grain Shortage?
　　"It's Not a Grain Shortage, It's a Shortage of Socialist Thought"
　　By Our Reporter Shang Kai
    The Jinan Basin is a well-known cotton and grain producing area in Shanxi Province. The grain retention standard for the masses here is over 420 jin per person per year, higher than any other region in the province. However, the "grain shortage" situation among the masses at the beginning of this summer was more serious than in other parts of the province, with widespread cries of "420 jin is not enough to eat!"
    Recently, Wang Xiujin, the secretary of the Hongzhao County Party Committee, came to Taiyuan to attend a meeting. Everyone asked him with concern: "Do the farmers in your area have enough to eat?" Because Hongzhao County is representative of southern Shanxi. Comrade Wang Xiujin smiled. He said, "It's not a grain problem, it's an ideological problem; once the ideological problem is solved, the grain problem will also be solved." Then, he told a "story of the Xiong Yan Agricultural Cooperative's grain shortage":
    There is a Lindeng Village in Hongzhao County, and in Lindeng Village there is a Xiong Yan Agricultural Production Cooperative. This cooperative experienced a grain shortage during the lean period before the summer harvest this year. Almost all of the 360 households in the cooperative were crying "grain shortage." Every day, many male and female members, old and young, went to the agricultural cooperative in groups to demand grain. They sat in the cooperative and refused to leave, pestering the cooperative cadres. The situation became increasingly fierce. It seemed that if grain was not supplied, people would starve to death.
    At that time, the more serious problem was that the grain shortage situation like that of the Xiong Yan Agricultural Cooperative was spreading throughout the county.
    "Is 420 jin of grain per person per year enough to eat?" Some of the county leaders also became suspicious. They decided to investigate the situation in the Xiong Yan Agricultural Cooperative.
    The county temporarily sent a working group to the Xiong Yan Agricultural Cooperative. When the members saw the county cadres coming, they made even more noise about the grain shortage. Wherever the working group cadres went, there was a chorus of "grain shortage." A tall, strong woman in the cooperative picked up a basket of dry food and started a competition with the working group cadres to see who could eat more. She was determined: "If you eat three, I'll eat four; if you eat four, I'll eat five. Let you see for yourselves: with my appetite, how can 420 jin be enough to eat?"
    The comrades of the working group were very calm. Through the Party branch and some of the cooperative cadres, they learned about the grain distribution situation of the members in the autumn of last year. They also looked through the old accounts of the members' grain distribution and found that the amount of grain retained by the whole cooperative was not low. Except for a few households of "five guarantees" who retained grain according to the standard of 420 jin, the rest of the households retained more than 430 jin, of which 108 households had between 440 jin and 460 jin, and 184 households had more than 460 jin.
    "The amount of grain retained greatly exceeds the standard, so why are they still clamoring that it's not enough to eat?" The comrades of the working group thought: "Obviously, this is not a grain problem, but an ideological problem." Therefore, through individual conversations with the members and holding report meetings, the working group first explained to the masses the base of grain production in the whole province and county; and introduced the fact that the grain retention standards in other regions of the province were lower than those in southern Shanxi (such as in the Yanbei area, where the grain retention standard was 360 jin per person due to low yields). Then, they explained to the masses the important significance of saving grain for supporting national construction, and the relationship between supporting national construction and improving people's lives. At the same time, they also criticized the individualism of the members that disregarded the interests of the state and the collective. After preliminary ideological education work was done, many people's understanding became clearer. They said: "We should live according to our means and not make trouble for the state and the cooperative." At this time, although some people were still shouting empty slogans, only 88 households firmly registered to demand grain, accounting for only 24.4% of the total number of cooperative members.
    Were these 88 households really short of grain? The working group could not draw a conclusion arbitrarily, so they put the list of these 88 households in front of the masses and let the masses discuss it themselves. The socialist consciousness of the masses gradually increased, and a great debate quickly unfolded. At first, it was debated in groups, then in production teams, and finally it developed into a great debate among all the cooperative members.
    In the process of the great debate, the members of the Xiong Yan Cooperative, through presenting their family situations, calculating detailed accounts, and exposing and criticizing individuals, learned how many people there were in each family, how much grain each family had distributed, who knew how to be diligent and thrifty, who was accustomed to extravagance and waste, who was really short of grain, and who was faking the grain shortage... The situation was finally clarified. It can be roughly divided into the following types:
    1. Twenty-nine households signed up for registration. They originally had grain, but when they saw others reporting a grain shortage, they followed suit, with the aim of registering as a grain-short household so that others would not say they had surplus grain.
    2. Twenty-one households were not very well-off in terms of grain, but would have enough to eat if they were slightly frugal.
    3. Five households were short of grain due to waste. Some of these people exchanged coarse grains for white flour to eat, and some exchanged grain for wine and cigarettes. The masses said that they had always been "eating whatever they grabbed and spending whatever they touched," and did not know how to manage their homes diligently and thriftily.
    4. Nineteen households had grain at home but deliberately made trouble. Some of these households were family members of counter-revolutionaries, some were loafers and lazy people, and some were speculators. For example, Liu Wenying had consistently falsely reported grain shortages for several years, defrauded the state of grain, and then sold it at high prices, and was a grain trafficker. Among these nineteen households, there were also some well-to-do middle peasants who were dissatisfied with the unified purchase and sale and took the opportunity to make trouble over grain. Liu Ningsheng distributed an average of 870 jin of grain per person, but was still making trouble.
    5. Only fourteen households were truly short of grain, accounting for less than 4% of the total number of cooperative members. The reasons for the grain shortage, in addition to the fact that some people did have high labor intensity and large appetites, were generally due to illness or weddings and funerals.
    The situation was clarified, the socialist consciousness of the masses was raised, and solutions to the problem were found: those who had grain automatically withdrew their demands for grain; those who were slightly short proposed to solve the problem through conservation; those who had a grain shortage due to waste, found ways to adjust with their own ideas and friends. Only for the fourteen households that were truly short of grain, the cooperative was responsible for mobilizing members with surplus grain to promote the spirit of mutual assistance and fraternity, and lending or selling them a portion of grain. In short, without the state needing to supply a single grain, the grain problem of the whole cooperative could be solved.
    When the results of the great debate were announced at the members' meeting, the members all laughed and told the truth. They said: "We don't have a grain shortage, we have a shortage of socialist thought!"

### 真缺粮还是假缺粮？　“不是缺粮，是缺少点社会主义思想”

　　真缺粮还是假缺粮？
　　“不是缺粮，是缺少点社会主义思想”
　　本报记者　商恺
    晋南盆地，是山西省著名的棉粮产区。这里群众的留粮标准，每人每年均在四百二十斤以上，比省内任何地区都高。但是，今年夏初，群众“闹粮”的情况，却比全省别的地区都要严重，普遍叫喊：“四百二十斤不够吃！”
    最近，洪赵县委书记王绣锦同志到太原来开会，大家都关心地问他：“你们那里农民到底够不够吃？”因为洪赵县在晋南是有代表性的。王绣锦同志笑了。他说：“不是粮食问题，是思想问题；思想问题解决了，粮食也就够吃了。”接着，他讲了一个“熊焰农业社闹粮的故事”：
    洪赵县有个临登村，临登村有个熊焰农业生产合作社。这个社在今年夏收以前这段青黄不接的时间里，闹起粮食问题来了。全社三百六十户，几乎是户户喊“缺粮”。每天都有许多男女老少社员，成群结伙地到农业社里去要粮。他们坐在社里不走，纠缠住社干部不放，越闹越凶。看样子，大有再不供应粮食就要饿死人之概。
    当时，更严重的问题是，像熊焰农业社这样闹粮的情况，正在全县范围内扩展。
    “一年四百二十斤口粮，到底够不够吃呢？”县里的领导干部，有的也发生了怀疑。他们决定到熊焰农业社里摸一摸底。
    县里临时派出一个工作组到了熊焰农业社。社员们看到县里的干部来了，闹粮就闹的更凶了。工作组的干部走到哪里，哪里就嚷起一片“缺粮”声。社里有一个身材高大、体强力壮的妇女，她端起一箩筐干粮，便和工作组的干部去赛吃。她打定了注意：“你吃三个，我就吃四个；你吃四个，我就吃五个。让你们亲眼看看：我这么大的饭量，四百二十斤怎么能够吃？”
    工作组的同志们态度很冷静。他们通过党支部和一部分社干部，了解了社员在去年秋天分粮的情况。又翻了翻社员分粮的老账，发现全社口粮的留量并不低。除了少数五保户是按四百二十斤的标准留粮以外，其余的户都在四百三十斤以上，其中四百四十斤到四百六十斤的有一百零八户，四百六十斤以上的有一百八十四户。
    “口粮的留量大大超过了标准，为什么还吵着不够吃呢？”工作组的同志这样想：“显然，这不是粮食问题，而是思想问题。”于是，工作组通过同社员个别交谈和举行报告会等形式，首先向群众说明了全省和全县粮食产量的底子；介绍了省内其他地区留粮标准都比晋南低的情况（像雁北区由于产量不高，那里每人留粮标准是三百六十斤）。接着，又向群众讲清楚了节约粮食对支援国家建设的重要意义，支援国家建设同改善人民生活的关系。同时，对社员群众中不顾国家和集体利益的个人主义思想，也进行了批判。做了初步的思想教育工作之后，许多人的认识比较清楚了。他们说：“应该有多大家底、过多大光景，不能硬去找国家和合作社的麻烦。”这时候，虽然还有些人在那里空喊，但是坚决登记要粮食的人，只剩下八十八户了，仅占社员总户数的24.4％。
    这八十八户是不是真的缺粮呢？工作组不能硬去作结论，只有把这八十八户的名单在群众面前摆出来，让群众自己讨论。群众的社会主义觉悟逐步提高，大辩论很快地展开了。起初是在小组里辩论，后来在生产队里辩论，最后发展成全体社员大辩论。
    在大辩论的过程中，熊焰社的社员们相互之间，经过摆家底、算细账，经过对个别人的揭发和批评，谁家有多少人口，谁家分了多少粮食，谁家懂得勤俭节约，谁家习惯于铺张浪费，谁家缺粮是真的，谁家缺粮是假的，……情况，终于澄清了。大致可分以下几种类型：
    一、报名挂号的有二十九户。他们本来有粮食，看到别人报缺粮，也跟着报缺粮，目的是挂个缺粮户的名，省得别人说自己有余粮。
    二、粮食不很宽裕，但稍节省一些就够吃的有二十一户。
    三、由于浪费而缺粮的有五户。这些人有的把粗粮换成白面吃了，有的把粮食换酒换烟吃了。群众说他们从来就是“抓到就吃、摸到就花”，不知勤俭持家。
    四、家中有粮食，故意取闹的，有十九户。这些户有的是反革命分子的家属，有的是二流子懒汉和投机商人。如刘文英，几年以来一贯假报缺粮，骗取国家粮食，再以高价出卖，是个粮食贩子。这十九个户中，还有些富裕中农，对统购统销不满，也趁机闹粮。刘宁生每人平均分粮八百七十斤，还在闹。
    五、真正缺粮的，只有十四户，还占不到社员总户数的4％。缺粮的原因，除了有些人确是劳动强度高、食量大以外，一般都是因为遇到了疾病或婚丧大事。
    情况澄清了，群众的社会主义觉悟提高了，解决问题的办法也就想出来了：有粮食的自动撤回了要粮的要求；稍缺的提出从节约中解决；因浪费而造成缺粮的，自己想法和亲友调剂。只有对十四户真正缺粮户，才由社里负责，动员有余粮的社员，发扬互助友爱精神，出借出售给他们一部分粮食。总之，不需要国家供应一粒粮食，便可以解决全社的粮食问题。
    在社员大会上宣布了大辩论的结果，社员们都笑了，说出了真情实话。他们说：“咱们不是缺粮，是缺少点社会主义思想！”
