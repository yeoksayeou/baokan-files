Title: Busy Surveying in the Qilian Mountains

The Qilian Mountains, rich in mineral resources, are now experiencing their best season of the year. The mountains, stretching for thousands of miles, wear helmets of ice and snow, the spruce forests in the valleys grow lush and green, and colorful flowers bloom in the grass at the foot of the mountains. The melodious songbirds flutter their wings and sing in the sky above the grassland. Surveyors, seeking various resources for the motherland, are taking advantage of this great time to intensify their work in the remote mountains.

The forest surveyors are the earliest to start work. They call themselves the people who "awaken the dawn of the Qilian Mountains." The Forest Comprehensive Survey Team of the Ministry of Forestry, working in the Zhamashi Forest Area in the south of the mountains, get up at four o'clock in the morning. Carrying instruments, they ride their horses into the forest, when the distant and nearby mountains have just begun to emerge in the morning light. They must finish their fieldwork before eleven o'clock, because there are a lot of horseflies in the forest, and when the sun is almost at its peak, swarms of horseflies will chase and bite people and horses. At this time, they can only light candles in sealed tents to do indoor work.

The First Survey Team of the Lanzhou Hydropower Design Institute of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry, which is surveying section by section along the Heihe River, has just moved to Youhulutan. They need to survey the terrain and geological conditions of this section of the river, which is shaped like a gourd, and the banks on both sides, to see if they can find a dam site for a power station to develop the treasures of the mountains.

In the Northwest Coalfield Geological Bureau's control survey team, located in the Qilian Mountain southern piedmont Weiyuan basin, are establishing survey markers and making observations in an area of more than 1,000 square kilometers. Here it rains several times a day, and there are often thunderstorms, rain, and hail. In order to work during the breaks between rains, they do not wait for the rain to stop before going to work, but set off for the work site in the rain and wait. When the clouds dissipate and the rain stops, they start observing. Raincoats are ineffective in this situation, and their clothes get wet almost every day. They are also familiar with what kind of clouds bring lightning. When they see "thunderclouds" slowly descending, they throw away conductive objects such as instruments, knives, and keys, and find a low-lying place to squat and avoid the danger. In this way, their work progress has not been affected by the climate.

The work site of the Fourth Detachment of the 643 Team of the Ministry of Geology, which is searching for chromite ore, is the highest. Their tents are pitched at Sanchashi, more than 4,000 meters above sea level. The air is relatively thin here, and when climbing mountains, they not only have to "pump the bellows" – gasp for breath – but also have to rest after taking a few steps. They often have to climb to mountain peaks more than 5,000 meters above sea level, where there is year-round snow, to collect ore samples. In such a harsh and cold environment, this detachment has found five or six chromite ore points with large areas in the past two months.

    祁连山里勘测忙
    矿藏丰富的祁连山区现在正是一年中最美好的季节。绵延千里的山峰戴着冰雪头盔，山谷里的云杉林长得郁郁葱葱，山麓草丛中遍开着各色的花朵。歌喉婉转的花雀拍着翅膀悬在草原上空歌唱。为祖国寻找各种资源的勘查人员正趁着这大好时光在人迹罕到的丛山中加紧工作。
    森林调查员是出工最早的人。他们称自己是“唤醒祁连山的黎明”的人们。在山南扎马什林区工作的林业部森林综合调查组，清晨四点钟就起床。他们携带仪器骑马入林的时候，远山、近山还刚刚在晨光中露出轮廓。他们必须在十一点钟以前做完野外工作，因为森林里牛虻特别多，太阳快当顶的时候，成群的牛虻便追逐着人马叮咬。这时候，他们只能在密封的帐篷里点起蜡烛来做室内工作。
    沿着黑河逐段勘查的电力工业部兰州水电设计院第一普查队刚刚搬到油葫芦滩。他们要勘查这一段像葫芦一样的河身和两岸的地形、地质情况，看能不能找出开发山区宝藏用电的电站坝址。
    在祁连山南麓亹源盆地的西北煤田地质局控制测量队，正在一千多平方公里的范围内造标和观测。现在这里每天都下几次雨，而且常常雷、雨、冰雹交加。为了在下雨间隙时间工作，他们不是等雨停了才上工，而是冒雨出发到工地上等候，云散雨收就动手观测。雨衣在这种情况下是不起作用的，他们的衣服几乎每天都被淋湿。他们也熟悉了什么样的云会带来雷电，看到“雷云”冉冉下降，就把仪器、小刀、钥匙等导电物件丢开，找个低洼地方蹲着躲避。就这样，他们的工作进度没有受到气候的影响。
    寻找铬矿的地质部六四三队四分队的工作地点最高，他们的帐篷扎在拔海四千多公尺的三岔什。这里空气比较稀薄，爬山的时候不仅要“拉风箱”——张嘴喘气，而且走几步就要休息一下。他们常常要爬到拔海五千多公尺的终年积雪的山峰上去采取矿样。在这样艰苦寒冷的环境里，这个分队两个月来已经找到五、六个范围较大的铬矿矿点了。
