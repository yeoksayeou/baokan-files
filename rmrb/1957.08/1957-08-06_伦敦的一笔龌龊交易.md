A Dirty Deal in London
By Our Commentator

On August 3rd, the British military authorities in the Arabian Peninsula announced that British ground forces had entered the Muscat region, preparing to rapidly expand the offensive against the Omani insurgents. This decision by the British occurred after Dulles held talks with British authorities on the Oman issue and had been notified to the United States in advance. This shows that the United States and Britain have united to carry out bloody suppression of the Omani people.

Since the Oman incident occurred, the United States, on the one hand, has stated that it "does not take sides," but in reality supports the British suppression actions. On the other hand, it has used this opportunity to openly exert pressure on Britain, demanding that Britain cede the Buraimi Oasis. To this end, Washington officials openly complained that "British troops entering the Buraimi Oasis may stimulate the Saudi King" and put "the United States in a dilemma between Britain and the King" because "Saudi Arabia is an important pillar of the Eisenhower Doctrine."

For Dulles, seizing the oil of the Persian Gulf is of much greater interest than seeking an agreement on disarmament issues. The content of his talks with British authorities in London on the Oman incident is kept secret by both sides. However, the representative of the Imam of Oman stationed in Cairo incisively exposed the dirty deal between the United States and Britain, which is to "allow the United States freedom of action in the Buraimi Oasis, while Britain has freedom of action in the Imamate of Oman." Britain's provision of military deployment information to Dulles and the rapid dispatch of ground troops after the talks reflects that the United States and Britain may have reached some temporary compromises in this secret transaction.

In recent years, Britain's colonial power in the Middle East has been limited to a corner of the Persian Gulf, and the several oil-rich sheikdoms on the western shore of the Persian Gulf are of great importance to Britain. In order to maintain its colonial rule in this region, in addition to stepping up the suppression of national independence movements, it also has to resist the exclusion and erosion of the United States. In the half-month since the Omani people's uprising, Britain's embarrassing situation has been fully exposed. On the one hand, it has carried out a frenzied bombing of the Omani insurgents, and on the other hand, it has repeatedly dealt with the United States in Washington and London. Now, in order to achieve the goal of suppressing the anti-colonialist movement along the Persian Gulf, it seems that Britain has to give up some of its interests to gain the support of the United States.

However, the current problem has touched the very foundation of Britain's colonial rule in the Middle East. Britain's practice of quenching its thirst with poison, colluding with the United States to suppress Arab nationalism, cannot maintain its precarious situation in the Persian Gulf for long. Temporary and partial compromises themselves breed more acute contradictions. Even during the US-British talks, American newspapers had already proposed a "long-term solution." The August 2nd editorial of the "New York Herald Tribune" said: "Even if the Oman war stops, neighboring kingdoms may fight again. The suggestion that Britain, the United States, Iraq, Iran, and Saudi Arabia guarantee the security of the Persian Gulf is worthy of study." It is conceivable what the status of Britain in the Persian Gulf would be under this "five-nation guarantee."

Obviously, Arab nationalism cannot be contained simply by suppressing the uprising of the Omani people. The further suppression measures taken by Britain in collusion with the United States, in addition to further exposing the hypocrisy and hideousness of the United States, which pretends to be a friend of the Arab people, also expose the stupidity of British colonialists.

    伦敦的一笔龌龊交易
    本报评论员
    8月3日，阿拉伯半岛的英国军事当局宣布，英国地面部队已经进入马斯喀特地区，准备迅速扩大对阿曼起义者的进攻。英国这一决定，发生在杜勒斯同英国当局就阿曼问题举行会谈以后，并且事先曾经通知了美国。这就表明，美英两国已经联合起来对阿曼人民进行血腥镇压了。
    阿曼事件发生以来，美国一方面表示“不偏袒任何一方”，实际上支持英国的镇压行动，另一方面又利用这个机会，露骨地对英国施加压力，要英国把布赖米绿洲让出来。为此，华盛顿的官员公开抱怨“英国军队开到布赖米绿洲可能刺激沙特国王”，并使“美国在英国和国王之间处于两难的地位”，因为“沙特是艾森豪威尔主义的一个重要支柱”。
    对于杜勒斯说来，夺取波斯湾的石油比在裁军问题上谋求协议兴趣大得多。他在伦敦同英国当局就阿曼事件会谈的内容，双方都讳莫如深。但是阿曼教长驻开罗的代表一针见血地揭穿了美英两国之间的龌龊买卖，这就是“让美国在布赖米绿洲有自由行动的权利，而英国对阿曼教长国有自由行动的权利”。英国向杜勒斯提供军事部署情况，并在会谈后迅速派出地面部队，这反映美、英两国在这场秘密交易中可能已经达成了某些暂时的妥协。
    近年以来，英国在中东的殖民势力已被局限于波斯湾内一隅之地，而波斯湾西岸的几个盛产石油的酋长国，对于英国更有着重大的关系。英国为了维持它在这个地区的殖民统治，除了加紧镇压民族独立运动以外，还得抵御美国的排挤和侵蚀。阿曼人民起义以来的半个多月里，英国这种狼狈的处境已经暴露无遗。它一方面对阿曼起义人民进行了疯狂的轰炸，同时又多次在华盛顿与伦敦同美国相周旋。现在，为了达到镇压波斯湾沿岸的反殖民主义运动的目的，看来英国不能不用出让部分利益来取得美国的支持了。
    但是，目前的问题已经触及到英国在中东的殖民统治的根本。英国这种饮鸩止渴、勾结美国镇压阿拉伯民族主义的做法，决不能长期维持它在波斯湾的残局。暂时的和局部的妥协本身，就孕育着更尖锐的矛盾因素。就在美英会谈期间，美国报纸已经提出“长期解决”的方案了。“纽约先驱论坛报”8月2日的社论说：“即令阿曼战争停止了，邻近各王国有可能再打起来。由英国、美国、伊拉克、伊朗和沙特阿拉伯五国来保证波斯湾安全的建议，是值得来加以研究的”。可以想像，在这个“五国保证”下，英国在波斯湾的地位会成了一个什么局面。
    很明显，阿拉伯民族主义决不是凭着镇压阿曼人民的起义就能遏止得了的。英国勾结美国所采取的进一步镇压措施，除了更加暴露伪装阿拉伯人民的朋友的美国的虚伪狰狞面貌以外，也暴露了英国殖民主义者的愚蠢。
