　　Old Letter
　　Ge Zhang
    To move, I sorted through old letters.

    I picked up a letter at random, and the date showed it was received on October 1, 1949. Thinking of the great day of the founding of the new China, I took out the letter paper.

    The paper had yellowed. It was a letter from an old comrade in Hankou, whom I hadn't seen for several years. The letter said: "...Let me tell you about some old comrades. Tian Yu was covering the Pingbao Campaign in 1946 on the front lines outside Shijiazhuang when he was electrocuted and died! Xiao Yi—you remember him, the tall Shanghai man—on April 14th, before the start of the Taiyuan Liberation Campaign, was covering political offensives on the front lines on a position southeast of Taiyuan city when he was shot in the ear by a sniper while speaking to the enemy and died on the spot! His remains are buried between the Twin Pagoda Temple outside Taiyuan City…."

    "...Let me talk about my family. My younger brother, a lively little devil, was brought out of the house by me along with my younger sister two years ago. He is now working as a deputy political instructor in a company of the 20th Army. He died during the Taiyuan Liberation Campaign while scaling the city wall! As for my younger sister, she was bombed to death by American-made Chiang Kai-shek planes in Fuping after the liberation of Shijiazhuang two years ago!..."

    I sat down silently, holding the letter. I also remembered Comrade Wang Ce, with whom I had worked and studied for several years. In October 1943, during the "Jin-Cha-Ji Anti-mopping up" campaign, how this only daughter, pampered since childhood, was captured due to illness and refused to yield. She was stabbed by the enemy's bayonet and died heroically while denouncing Japanese fascism, traitors, and special agents! I also remembered that just before the Party's birthday in 1950, when I was in Hankou and was welcoming the heroic troops returning from the sea crossing operation with excitement, a familiar comrade brought me the news that my younger brother had died in the Hainan Island Liberation Campaign!…

    Facing this old letter, I thought of the historical journey that the Party has led us through and will continue to advance on, and I also thought of the nonsense spouted by a handful of people with blackened hearts that has been exposed in the newspapers these days. I couldn't help but feel the anger expressed in the newspapers by hundreds of millions of workers and peasants! I think, facing this letter, facing the blood of these comrades that is so vivid in my memory, my excited feelings are appropriate; it is my right!

　　旧信
　　戈章
    为搬家，整理整理旧日的信件。
    随手拿起一封信，看日期正是1949年10月1日收到的。我想着新中国开国第一天这个伟大的日子，我抽出里面的信纸。
    纸色都已发黄了。是当时在汉口收到的一个分别几年的老同志的来信。信里说：“……告诉你几个老同志的消息吧。田雨1946年平保战役在石家庄外围火线上采访，触电牺牲了！萧逸——你还记得是长长身条的上海人，4月14日解放太原战役开始前，在太原城外东南的一个阵地上，采访火线上政治攻势时，正在对敌喊话中，被冷枪打中耳部，当即牺牲！遗体葬在太原城外的双塔寺之间……。
    “……谈谈我的家里。我弟弟，一个活泼的小鬼。前年被我从家里连同妹妹一起带出来。已在二十兵团一个连队里作副政指工作，解放太原战役中，在登城时牺牲了！妹妹呢，则也在前年石家庄解放后，被美造蒋机炸死于阜平……！”
    我拿着信默默地坐下。我又想起曾有几年在一起工作和学习的王册同志，在1943年10月“晋察冀”“反扫荡”中，以一个自幼娇养的独生女，如何因病被俘不屈，在敌人的刺刀下，痛骂日本法西斯、汉奸、特务，英勇就义的情景！我又想起就在1950年党的生日之前，在汉口当我以兴奋的心情欢迎渡海作战归来的英雄部队时，相熟的同志如何带给我弟弟已在解放海南岛战役中牺牲了的消息！……
    我面对着这封旧信，联想到党领导着我们走过来并将继续前进的历史途程，又联想到这些天报纸上所揭露的一小撮黑了良心的人的胡说。我又禁不住随着亿万工人、农民在报纸上所表示的愤怒而愤怒！我想，我对着这封信，对着我记忆是这样鲜明的这些同志们的鲜血，我这种激动的感情是应该的；是我的权利！
