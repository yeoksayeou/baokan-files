After basically eliminating counter-revolutionaries, in addition to special agents dispatched by foreign enemies and a few remaining counter-revolutionaries, hooligans, layabouts, thieves, murderers, rapists, swindlers, and criminals who disrupt public order and seriously violate law and discipline have become the main threats to social order in our urban and rural areas. These criminal elements, commonly referred to as bad elements, are as hated by the broad masses of the people as counter-revolutionaries, and are also reactionary elements that undermine socialist construction. It is necessary to implement dictatorship over such bad elements, resolutely crack down on them, until they are completely eliminated. Otherwise, we cannot further guarantee the safety of people's lives and property and the stability of social order.

The destructive activities of bad elements are serious. Among the criminal activities of bad elements, theft cases are the most numerous, causing great losses to the country and the people. For example, in November 1956, a thief named Yu Yun stole 15,000 yuan from the Shanghai Glass Company in one instance. On December 16th of last year, Beijing captured a swindler who had been released after serving his sentence, named Pang Zemin. This bad element, posing as a captain in the People's Liberation Army, traveled to more than forty cities including Shanghai and Beijing, engaging in fraudulent activities more than fifty times, defrauding property worth more than 10,000 yuan, and seducing two female students. Cases of bad elements raping and insulting women are also intolerable. The hooligan Wang Yongxue in Baoding, from 1955 to January of this year, successively raped fourteen girls under the age of seven, and killed two of them after raping them. In addition, there are still a certain number of cases of bad elements killing the masses and state workers, which deserves serious vigilance. The broad masses of the people urgently demand that the People's Government eliminate these bad elements, and demand that the state implement resolute and merciless dictatorship over these beasts in human skin. Conversely, if we are blindly lenient towards these bad elements, failing to deal with cases that should be dealt with, or failing to severely punish those who should be severely punished, it is tantamount to encouraging bad elements to do evil, which will inevitably make the people feel disappointed and dissatisfied, and it means that the political and legal organs are neglecting their duties.

In the past few years, our political and legal organs, in the successive movements to suppress counter-revolutionaries, have eliminated a large number of bad elements, and have carried out mass movements to crack down on hooligans and bandits, making the social order in urban and rural areas across the country appear unprecedentedly stable, and improving year by year. However, there are still many bad elements now, and their activities have been rampant in certain areas in the past year. What is the reason for this?

One reason is that the hordes of counter-revolutionaries, habitual thieves, and hooligans left over from old China, although few in number after years of crackdowns since liberation, their destructive activities are vicious, and they are the principal offenders in several major cases. Some criminals have incorrigible bad habits and continue to engage in criminal activities after being released from prison. And they intentionally instigate others to commit crimes, especially instigating children to commit crimes, causing new criminals to emerge continuously, which has a great corrosive effect on the new society.

Another reason is that after the socialist revolution in 1956 achieved basic victory in terms of ownership, many comrades mistakenly believed that the socialist revolution had already succeeded, and neglected or relaxed the political and ideological education work for workers, peasants, students, and general staff. And when carrying out political and ideological education, they did not closely combine it with the current social reality, political situation, and the ideological state of the masses in our country. Many comrades did not fully estimate that, in our country, since there are still bourgeoisie, elements who adhere to reactionary positions, remaining counter-revolutionaries and various bad elements, they will inevitably influence certain masses. Many comrades also did not fully estimate that the ideology of the bourgeoisie and other exploiting classes still occupies a certain position in the minds of a considerable number of people, who pursue the bourgeois way of life, and for personal enjoyment, can damage the interests of the country and the people. A group of new criminal elements have grown up under these circumstances. In addition, many economic units, organs, and schools are careless and have lax property management systems, which also gives bad elements opportunities to act.

Of particular note is that some comrades in the political and legal departments only saw that criminal cases were decreasing year by year, neglecting that the activities of bad elements are still quite serious, and did not take specific measures based on the current specific situation. Moreover, many comrades regarded the problem of bad elements as an internal problem of the people, regarding bad elements as part of the people, and did not implement dictatorship over them, but mistakenly applied the formula of unity—criticism—unity, thereby relaxing the crackdown on them, or although cracking down, it was not forceful enough.

Here we can see that many comrades still have many confused ideas about how to distinguish between the people and the enemy. Chairman Mao gave clear instructions on this issue in his report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." He said: "At the present stage, during the period of socialist construction, all classes, strata, and social groups that approve, support, and participate in the cause of socialist construction belong to the scope of the people; all social forces and social groups that resist the socialist revolution and are hostile to and undermine socialist construction are enemies of the people." It is clear that bad elements burn, kill, loot, and commit all kinds of evil, and their role in the cause of socialism is only destructive. Therefore, Chairman Mao said in the same report: "In order to maintain social order and the interests of the broad masses of the people, it is also necessary to implement dictatorship over those thieves, swindlers, murderers, arsonists, hooligan gangs, and various bad elements who seriously disrupt social order."

All bad elements who disrupt social order must be arrested if they should be arrested; they must be convicted if they should be convicted; they must be severely punished if they should be severely punished; and those who continue to commit crimes after being released from prison must be arrested and convicted again. The public security, procuratorial, and judicial departments must correct the phenomena of failing to arrest those who should be arrested, failing to convict those who should be convicted, failing to supervise those who should be supervised, and giving light sentences for serious crimes. In the past, some comrades were very afraid of confusing the two types of contradictions, regarding contradictions among the people as contradictions between the enemy and ourselves, so they were very afraid of making wrong arrests, very afraid of making wrong judgments, and very afraid of giving heavy sentences, in short, they were very afraid of breaking the law. Of course, we should pay attention to strictly distinguishing between the two types of contradictions with different natures, and we must distinguish between bad elements and those who occasionally commit minor theft or corruption, or take small advantages of public or other people's property, as well as those who fight and brawl due to private disputes and do not constitute criminal behavior. However, the current problem does not lie in regarding the people as the enemy, but in regarding the enemy as the people; the problem is not in making wrong arrests or giving heavy sentences, but in failing to arrest those who should be arrested, failing to convict those who should be convicted, failing to supervise those who should be supervised, and giving light sentences for serious crimes. This cannot but encourage the arrogance of bad elements, so that some hooligans even dare to beat and scold public security personnel, thinking that "the Public Security Bureau is now rectifying its work style and dare not rectify us, so we can boldly do it," and even clamoring "we will beat them until they dare not control us." The urgent task now is to resolutely overcome the right-leaning ideas of some comrades in the political and legal departments. All bad elements should know that the political and legal departments are indeed going to rectify their work style, first of all to eliminate the unhealthy trend of being weak and powerless against bad elements, and to severely crack down on these enemies of socialism, in order to resolutely safeguard the interests of the broad masses of the people and defend socialist construction.

In order to crack down on the destructive activities of bad elements, cities and towns on important transportation routes where the activities of bad elements are more serious, as well as factories, mines, enterprises, and rural areas where theft and hooliganism are serious, should, under the unified leadership of the local Party committee and the People's Committee, fully mobilize the masses to carry out one or more mass struggles against theft, against disruption of public order, and against other criminal activities. The purpose of this struggle is not only to further guarantee the stability of social order, but also to directly and indirectly crack down on the activities of counter-revolutionaries. We know that some counter-revolutionaries are hidden among various bad elements, and bad elements are often easily exploited by counter-revolutionaries, and often develop into counter-revolutionaries. As for the destructive activities of bad elements, from the perspective of their harm and consequences, they are a direct coordination with the subversive activities of counter-revolutionaries. Therefore, cracking down on bad elements is a necessary measure to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship.

Cracking down on the activities of bad elements and establishing a new social atmosphere are two aspects of the same thing. Eliminating the influence of the bourgeoisie and other exploiting classes, so that the masses have a strong resistance to their bad influence, and actively participating in the struggle against bad elements is a long-term task, which requires work in many aspects, especially strengthening political and ideological education work. In the struggle against bad elements, all organs, people's organizations, Party committees of schools, and agricultural production cooperatives should educate employees, cadres, youth, women, students, and peasants to oppose bourgeois individualism and corrupt and degenerate behavior, and establish the concept of abiding by the law, abiding by public order, and cherishing state property. In order to further cultivate new moral customs among the broad masses, especially among the youth, eliminate the possibility of bad elements engaging in destructive activities, create a more stable social order for our country, and provide the people with a more stable production and living environment.

### 对坏分子必须实行专政

    对坏分子必须实行专政
    在基本上肃清了反革命分子以后，除了国外敌人派遣的特务和少数残留的反革命分子以外，流氓，阿飞，盗窃犯，凶杀犯，强奸犯，诈骗犯，破坏公共秩序、严重违法乱纪的罪犯，便成了我国城乡社会秩序的主要威胁。这些刑事犯罪分子，通常称为坏分子，他们跟反革命分子同样受到广大人民群众的痛恨，同样是破坏社会主义建设的反动分子。对这样的坏分子必须实行专政，坚决打击，直到完全肃清。否则就不能够进一步保障人民生命财产的安全和社会秩序的安定。
    坏分子的破坏活动是严重的。在坏分子的犯罪活动中，以盗窃案件的数量为最大，给国家和人民造成了很大损失。例如，1956年11月间，盗窃犯俞云一次偷窃上海玻璃公司一万五千元。去年12月16日，北京市捕获了一个刑满释放的骗子手，名叫庞泽民。这个坏分子冒充人民解放军的上尉军官，跑遍了上海、北京等四十多个城市，进行诈骗活动五十多次，骗取财物值一万多元，并且诱奸了两个女学生。坏分子强奸污辱妇女的案件，也令人不能容忍。保定流氓王永学，从1955年到今年1月，先后奸污不满七周岁的幼女十四人，并且把其中的两人奸后杀害。此外，坏分子杀害群众和国家工作人员的案件，也还有一定数量，值得严重警惕。广大的人民群众迫切要求人民政府消灭这些坏分子，要求国家对这些披着人皮的野兽实行坚决无情的专政。反之，如果对于这些坏分子一味宽大，当办不办，当严办的不严办，那就等于鼓励坏分子作恶，那就必然使人民感到失望和不满，那就是政法机关玩忽了自己的职守。
    过去几年来，我们的政法机关在历次镇压反革命分子的运动中，清除了一大批坏分子，并且开展了打击流氓盗匪的群众性运动，使全国城乡社会秩序出现了前所未有的安定局面，而且一年比一年有所进步。但是坏分子现在仍然不少，最近一年来在某些范围内他们的活动还很猖獗。这是什么原故呢？
    一个原因是：旧中国遗下的成群成堆的反革命分子、惯盗、惯窃、流氓，经过解放以后历年的打击，所剩虽然不多，但是他们的破坏活动是凶恶的，他们是若干大的案件的主犯。有些罪犯恶习难改，在刑满释放以后仍然继续从事犯罪活动。而且他们还有意地教唆别人犯罪，特别是教唆少年儿童犯罪，使新的罪犯陆续地发生，对新社会有很大的腐蚀作用。
    另一个原因是：在1956年的社会主义革命在所有制方面取得基本胜利之后，许多同志误以为社会主义革命已经成功，忽视或放松了对工人、农民、学生和一般工作人员的政治思想教育工作。而在进行政治思想教育的时候，又没有紧密地结合我国当前的社会实际状况、政治形势、群众的思想状况。许多同志没有充分估计到，在我们国家，目前既然还有资产阶级，还有坚持反动立场的分子、残余的反革命分子和各种坏分子，那他们就必然会给某些群众以影响。许多同志也没有充分估计到，资产阶级以及其他剥削阶级的思想，在相当一部分人的头脑中，还占据着一定的地位，他们追求资产阶级的生活方式，为了个人享乐，可以破坏国家和人民的利益。有一批新的刑事犯罪分子，就是在这种情况下生长起来的。另外，许多经济单位、机关、学校麻痹大意，财物管理制度不严，也给了坏分子以活动的机会。
    特别值得注意的是，政法部门的一部分同志，只看到刑事犯罪案件逐年减少，忽视了目前坏分子的活动仍然是相当严重的，没有根据当前的具体情况，采取具体的措施。更有许多同志把坏分子问题当作了人民内部问题，把坏分子当作了人民的一部分，对他们没有实行专政，而是错误地搬用了团结——批评——团结的公式，以致放松了对他们的打击，或者虽打击而不够有力。
    在这里可以看到，许多同志对于怎样区别人民和敌人，还有许多糊涂思想。毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告中，对这个问题有明确的指示。他说：“在现阶段，在建设社会主义的时期，一切赞成、拥护和参加社会主义建设事业的阶级、阶层和社会集团，都属于人民的范围；一切反抗社会主义革命和敌视、破坏社会主义建设的社会势力和社会集团，都是人民的敌人。”很明显，坏分子烧杀淫掠，无恶不作，他们对社会主义事业所起的作用，仅仅是破坏作用。因此毛主席在同一报告中说：“为了维护社会秩序和广大人民的利益，对于那些盗窃犯、诈骗犯、杀人放火犯、流氓集团和各种严重破坏社会秩序的坏分子，也必须实行专政。”
    凡属破坏社会秩序的坏分子，应该逮捕的一定要逮捕；应该判罪的一定要判罪；应该判重罪的一定要判重罪；刑满释放后继续犯罪的，一定要再捕再判。公安、检察、司法部门必须纠正该捕不捕、该判不判、该管制不管制以及重罪轻判的现象。过去有些同志很怕混淆了两类矛盾，把人民内部矛盾当成了敌我矛盾，所以很怕错捕，很怕错判，很怕重判，总之是很怕犯法。我们当然应该注意严格区别两类不同性质的矛盾，对于偶尔发生轻微的偷窃、贪污行为的人，或者占公家的、别人的小便宜的人，以及因为私人纠纷而打架斗殴并没有构成犯罪行为的人，必须同坏分子加以区别。然而现在的问题并不发生在把人民当作了敌人，而是发生在把敌人当作了人民；问题不在错捕、重判，而在该捕不捕、该判不判、该管制不管制以及重罪轻判。这样就不能不助长坏分子的气焰，以致有些流氓竟然敢于打骂公安人员，以为“现在公安局整风，不敢整我们，可以大胆干”，甚至扬言“要打到他们不敢管我们”。现在的迫切任务，就是要坚决克服政法部门某些同志的右倾思想。应当让一切坏分子知道：政法部门确是要整风，首先要整掉对坏分子软弱无力的歪风，严厉地打击这些社会主义的敌人，以便坚决地维护广大人民的利益，保卫社会主义的建设。
    为了打击坏分子的破坏活动，凡是坏分子活动比较严重的城市、交通要道上的城镇，以及盗窃、流氓犯罪活动情况严重的厂矿、企业单位和农村，都应当在当地党委和人民委员会的统一领导之下，充分发动群众，开展一次或几次反对盗窃、反对破坏公共秩序和其他犯罪活动的群众斗争。这个斗争的目的不仅是为了进一步保障社会秩序的安定，同时也是为了直接和间接地打击反革命分子的活动。我们知道，在各种坏分子中隐藏着一些反革命分子，而坏分子也往往容易为反革命分子所利用，也往往发展成为反革命分子。至于坏分子的破坏活动，从它的危害性来看，从它的后果来看，都是对反革命分子颠覆活动的直接配合。因此，打击坏分子，正是巩固人民民主专政的必要措施。
    打击坏分子的活动，和树立新的社会风气，是一件事情的两个方面。扫除资产阶级以及其他剥削阶级的影响，使群众对于它们的恶劣影响具有坚强的抵抗力，并且积极参加反对坏分子的斗争，这是一个长期的任务，需要从多方面进行工作，尤其需要加强政治思想教育工作。在反对坏分子的斗争中，各机关、各人民团体、学校党委、农业生产合作社，都应当向职工、干部、青年、妇女、学生和农民进行教育，反对资产阶级个人主义思想和腐化堕落行为，树立遵守法制、遵守公共秩序和爱护国家财产的观念。以便在广大群众中，在青年中，进一步培养起新的道德风尚，杜绝坏分子从事破坏活动的可能，给我们的国家创造更加安定的社会秩序，使人民有更加安定的生产和生活的环境。
