Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, August 24th: The anti-Rightist struggle in Anshan has expanded from municipal-level organizations, Anshan Iron and Steel (An'gang), and Anshan Construction (An'jian) companies to grassroots units and various industries. After criticizing Rightist thought and liberalism, the number of Rightists exposed recently has increased by more than one and a half times compared to half a month ago.

Currently, in nearly a hundred government and enterprise units in Anshan that have launched anti-Rightist struggles, many units hold debates every day to engage in reasoned struggle with Rightists. In the engineering and technical circles, a group of Rightists has been exposed and criticized, including Li Lide, who called himself a "speaking out hero" and published an anti-Party and anti-socialist "Ten Thousand Word Letter" attempting to abolish Party leadership and attacking the suppression of counter-revolutionaries policy; Zhu Xin, who would rather be a servant of Britain and the United States than a master of China; Qi Baozong, who slandered the Soviet Union and attacked Party leadership and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries policy; and Wu Junqing, who attempted to organize reactionary political parties to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party. In the education sector, Jiang Jianqun, who viciously attacked the Party's education and personnel system, falsely claiming that it is now an era where fake foreign devils do not allow Ah Q to revolt; Yang Guofan, who proposed abolishing the Party committee system and implementing "democratic school management"; and Bai Zhiyang, who systematically attacked the suppression of counter-revolutionaries policy, have been exposed and criticized. In addition, Zhang Yuyuan, the head of the Anshan branch of the China Democratic League who actively promoted the anti-communist and anti-socialist program of the Zhang-Luo alliance; Fan Guodong, from the medical and health field, who slandered the Party's inability to lead science and technology; and Xu Guangzhen, a Party class instructor who wore the cloak of a Communist Party member and fired sixteen poisonous arrows at the Party, have also had their reactionary faces further exposed.

Through the mass face-to-face struggle, some very cunning and stubborn Rightists have been refuted to the point of being speechless in the face of a large number of facts. Some Rightists have lowered their heads and pleaded guilty to the people. Li Shufan, who supported "fixed interest for twenty years," has admitted that he is a reactionary capitalist. The conspirator Shen Naimin, who clamored that "I hope China can also start a 'Hungarian incident'," also admitted that he launched an attack on the Party with purpose, planning, and strategy, attempting to undermine socialist enterprises as a Rightist. The anti-Party group headed by Li Huizhong, deputy editor-in-chief of the "Anshan Daily," has begun to disintegrate. Apart from Li Huizhong, Hou Yun, and Xue Mai, who are still dodging, other elements involved in anti-Party activities, such as Liu Mu, Gao Wei, Zhang Shi, You Qingxin, and Yu Chengji, have begun to revolt or surrender, and have initially confessed to anti-Party facts.

After criticizing Rightist thought and liberalism, some units that previously thought they had no Rightists have also exposed Rightists. The Anshan Municipal People's Committee system, which previously believed that there were very few Rightists, has recently discovered a group of Rightists in seventeen units. The Anshan Branch of the Black Metallurgical Design Institute also discovered Rightists and a small Rightist group through the great debate. In the technical personnel and staff of grassroots factories and mines such as the seamless steel pipe factory of An'gang, the Dashiqiao Magnesite Mine, and the mechanical installation engineering company and pipeline engineering company of An'jian, the anti-Rightist struggle has also begun to unfold. While carrying out the anti-Rightist struggle, these factories and mines are also improving their work, adhering to production and construction, and have gained some experience in mobilizing the masses to fight Rightists to promote the increase production and practice economy campaign.

### 批判右倾思想　克服温情主义　鞍山反右派斗争扩展到基层

    批判右倾思想　克服温情主义
　　鞍山反右派斗争扩展到基层
    新华社鞍山24日电　鞍山市反右派斗争已由市级机关、鞍钢、鞍建两公司开始扩展到基层单位和各行各业。经过批判右倾思想和温情主义后，最近揭露出来的右派分子已比半个月前增加一倍半以上。
    目前，在鞍山市已展开反右派斗争的近百个机关和企业单位中，每天都有许多单位召开辩论会，同右派分子进行说理斗争。在工程技术界，已揭露和批判了自称为“鸣放英雄”，发表反党反社会主义的“万言书”企图取消党的领导，并攻击肃反政策的李立德；宁愿做英美的仆役，不愿做中国的主人的朱新；污蔑苏联，攻击党的领导和肃反政策的祁宝宗；妄图组织反动党派来推翻共产党的领导的伍俊卿等一批右派分子。在教育界中，揭露和批判了恶毒地攻击党的教育、人事制度，诬称现在是假洋鬼子不准阿Q革命时代的姜健群；提出取消党委制实行“民主办校”的杨国范；系统地攻击肃反政策的白志扬等。此外，积极推行章罗联盟反共反社会主义纲领的民盟鞍山市负责人张裕元；污蔑党不能领导科学技术的医药卫生界的樊国栋；披着共产党员的外衣向党发出十六支毒箭的党课教员许广镇等右派分子的反动面目，也已经进一步暴露出来。
    经过群众展开面对面的斗争，一些十分狡猾顽固的右派分子在大量的事实面前已被批驳得理屈词穷，哑口无言。有些右派分子已低头向人民请罪。拥护“定息二十年”的李树藩，已经承认他是一个反动的资本家。扬言“希望中国也能掀起一个‘匈牙利事件’”的阴谋家沈乃敏，也承认他是有目的、有计划、有策略地向党进攻，企图搞垮社会主义企业的右派分子。以“鞍山日报”副总编辑李惠众为首的反党集团已经开始瓦解，除了李惠众、侯韵、薛麦还在躲躲闪闪外，其他参与反党活动的分子，如刘穆、高伟、张实、游庆新、于成吉等，都已开始起义或投降，初步交代反党事实。
    批判了右倾思想和温情主义以后，一些过去认为没有右派分子的单位也揭露出了右派分子。过去认为右派分子很少的鞍山市人民委员会系统，最近已在十七个单位中发现了一批右派分子。黑色冶金设计院鞍山分院通过大辩论，也发现了右派分子，并发现了右派小集团。在鞍钢的无缝钢管厂、大石桥镁矿和鞍建的机械安装工程公司、管道工程公司等基层厂矿企业的技术人员和职员中，反右派斗争也已经开始展开。这些厂矿一边进行反右派斗争，一边改进工作、坚持生产建设，并且取得了发动群众斗争右派分子推动增产节约运动的一些经验。
