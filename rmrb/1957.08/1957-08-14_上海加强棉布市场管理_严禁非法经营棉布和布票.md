Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 13th: The Shanghai Municipal People's Committee issued supplementary regulations on August 5th to strengthen the management of the cotton cloth market, strictly prohibiting speculative and illegal activities such as illegal dealing in cotton cloth and cloth ration coupons.

According to an investigation by the Shanghai branch of the China Textile Products Company, there are many vendors and brokers in the Shanghai market illegally dealing in cotton cloth, cloth products, and illegally buying and selling cloth ration coupons. There are at least 300 vendors in the city illegally dealing in cotton cloth, and even more illegally dealing in clothing and other cloth products. In the Luxiangyuan Road area of the Yimiao district, there are 600 to 700 concentrated cloth product vendors who engage in wholesale transactions of hundreds of dozens of children's clothing, with daily sales reaching over 20,000 yuan. These vendors not only openly undermine the planned cotton cloth supply system by selling shoddy clothing at high prices without collecting cloth ration coupons, but also induce women, steal cloth ration coupons, and bribe visiting procurement cadres.

The vendors illegally dealing in cotton cloth and cloth products also illegally purchase cloth ration coupons through scalpers and brokers at prices ranging from two to seven fen per foot, and then use them to purchase cotton cloth from state-owned or joint state-private cloth stores. Some scalpers and brokers even organize groups to sell cloth ration coupons, sending people to rural areas in Jiangsu and Zhejiang to purchase cloth ration coupons and transport them to Shanghai for sale, with a single shipment exceeding 10,000 feet. According to incomplete statistics from eight districts, including Huangpu and Yimiao, more than 212,000 feet of cloth ration coupons were seized for illegal trading in May and June this year.

The districts of Shanghai are now strictly prohibiting these illegal activities in accordance with the supplementary regulations of the Municipal People's Committee. Penglai District has already dealt with 36 vendors illegally trading in cotton cloth, purchasing more than 33,000 feet of cotton cloth and confiscating more than 46,000 feet of cloth ration coupons. Yimiao District recently arrested a group of cotton cloth speculators with egregious circumstances according to law. The speculative group headed by Zhou Yiwen was found to have more than 10,000 feet of cloth ration coupons, as well as a large amount of cotton cloth and clothing, when it was broken up.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 13th: Factories, enterprises, government agencies, and schools in Shanghai are cooperating closely with the Shanghai branch of the China Textile Products Company to save a large amount of cotton cloth. According to recent statistics from the Municipal Textile Products Company: in the first seven months of this year, the city saved 13.13 million city feet of industrial and public cloth. In addition, the Municipal Textile Products Company also saved cotton yarn and cotton that could be woven into more than 3.69 million city feet of cotton cloth for the country in the first half of this year.

According to the Municipal Textile Products Company, there is still great potential for saving cotton cloth in Shanghai. The company will continue to send people to factories to visit and work with relevant units to save more cotton cloth.

    上海加强棉布市场管理
    严禁非法经营棉布和布票
    新华社上海13日电　上海市人民委员会在8月5日作出加强棉布市场管理的补充规定，严格禁止非法经营棉布、布票等投机违法行为。
    据中国纺织品公司上海市公司调查，上海市场上有不少摊贩、掮客非法经营棉布、布制品和非法买卖布票。全市非法经营棉布的摊贩至少在三百户以上，非法经营服装等布制品的为数更多。在邑庙区露香园路一带集中的布制品摊贩有六、七百户，他们经营成百打的童装批发交易，每天营业额最高达两万元以上。这些摊贩不仅公然破坏棉布计划供应制度，不收布票高价出售粗制滥造的服装，还诱骗妇女、盗窃布票和行贿外来采购干部。
    非法经营棉布和布制品的摊贩，还通过黄牛、掮客，以二分到七分钱一尺的价格非法收买布票，然后向国营或公私合营布店套购棉布。有的黄牛、掮客竟组织贩卖布票的集团，派人到江浙一带农村收买布票运来上海出售，一次贩运在一万尺以上。据黄浦、邑庙等八个区的不完全统计，今年5、6两月中，查获非法买卖的布票有二十一万二千多尺。
    上海市各区现在正根据市人民委员会的补充规定，严格禁止这些违法行为。蓬莱区已经处理了非法买卖棉布的摊贩三十六户，收购棉布三万三千多尺，没收布票四万六千多尺。邑庙区最近依法逮捕了一批情节恶劣的棉布投机分子，其中以周益文为首的投机集团，在破获时查到布票一万多尺，还有大量棉布和服装。
    据新华社上海13日电　上海市的工厂、企业、机关、学校同中国纺织品公司上海市公司密切合作，节约了大量棉布。据市纺织品公司最近统计：在今年头七个月中，全市节约了工业用布和公共用布一千三百一十三万市尺。此外，市纺织品公司在今年上半年内还为国家节约了可以织成三百六十九万多市尺棉布的棉纱和棉花。
    据市纺织品公司了解，目前上海市棉布节约潜力还很大。这个公司将继续派人下厂访问，同各有关单位共同研究，节约更多的棉布。
