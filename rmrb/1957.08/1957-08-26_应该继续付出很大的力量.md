Editorial: Should Continue to Exert Great Effort

    The admission lists for high schools and junior high schools in various regions have been released one after another. A portion of junior high and elementary school graduates are preparing to welcome new learning tasks. What should junior high and elementary school graduates who have not been admitted do? The answer is: there are many things to do!

    This year, all regions have attached great importance to the issues of enrollment and employment for primary and secondary school graduates. Ideological and political education, labor education, and social publicity and education have been carried out earlier, more extensively, deeply, and meticulously. At the same time, investigations have generally been conducted regarding graduates returning to their hometowns to participate in agricultural production, and specific and appropriate resettlement plans have been formulated. Therefore, this year's primary and secondary school graduates, parents, and cadres have had relatively sufficient ideological preparation. Judging from the situation in various regions, the effect of this work is good. Currently, a large number of urban and rural young students who have not been admitted are responding to the call of the state and heading to the agricultural production front. In Sichuan Province, more than 300,000 primary and secondary school students whose homes are in rural areas have returned to the countryside, and in Henan Province, more than 360,000 graduates have returned home. Many local township governments and agricultural cooperatives are enthusiastically welcoming and arranging for the returning students. Many parents are finding ways to help their children who have not been admitted to find jobs or helping them to study on their own, and some are actively encouraging their children to go to the countryside to participate in production.

    Such a large-scale participation of educated youth in production would have been impossible in China's past history. This shows that socialist ideology is triumphing over the ideology of the exploiting classes. This is a great ideological revolution. Socialist ideology regards labor as the driving force for human survival and social progress. Socialist education enables people to master cultural and scientific knowledge to transform nature, continuously improve labor productivity, and gradually improve people's material and cultural lives. The exploiting classes despise labor, and they regard reading as a ladder to officialdom and wealth. We have now fundamentally changed the bad habits of the old society and established the good habits of the new society. Young students who have already participated in agricultural production should stand firm, not be afraid of difficulties, and wage an irreconcilable struggle against the remnants of the exploiting classes' thinking that despises physical labor and against old habits. Other students who have not been admitted, if they have not yet participated in productive labor, should now resolutely devote themselves to productive labor.

    Many primary and secondary school graduates who have long been engaged in industrial, agricultural, handicraft production, and various service industries have overcome various difficulties in their respective positions and achieved outstanding results through creative labor, earning the welcome of all parties and the honor given by the people and the state. Many people have become advanced workers and labor models. The deeds of elementary school graduate Xu Jianchun are well known to many. She was not only elected as a national agricultural labor model, but also elected as a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League this year. Yang Changjiang, a junior high school graduate from Yuxian County, Henan Province, studied advanced agricultural techniques conscientiously and achieved a large-scale bumper harvest on barren land, and was selected as a labor model twenty-eight times. This year, tens of thousands of students from Kaifeng Prefecture, Henan Province, who had just returned to their hometowns, devoted themselves to the intense flood prevention struggle and participated in various productive labor. Kang Xiaozhi, a high school graduate from Tongxu County, did not leave the river embankment for three days and nights during the flood prevention work of repairing dikes and blocking breaches. Many commune members reflected: "This year's graduates are very different from those in previous years after returning to the countryside. In previous years, graduates returned home and wandered around in groups, but this year they went to the fields to produce as soon as they arrived home." These things show that as long as you work hard, everyone has a bright future and will be respected and praised by the masses.

    This year, for primary and secondary school graduates who have not been admitted, in addition to those whose homes are in rural areas and some urban students who have been arranged to go to the countryside, the state has also made arrangements in other aspects, such as various handicrafts and service industries, as much as possible. Some students have happily chosen these professions, going to various industries such as food, barber shops, bathhouses, shops, trams, and automobiles to work as service personnel, salespersons, and apprentices. Some craftsmen or parents with a skill also lead their children to learn a certain skill. These are all worthy of praise. As long as it is beneficial to the people and serves the people, any kind of work is glorious. We hope that junior high and elementary school graduates who have not been admitted, if they have any opportunities, can learn any skill, as long as it is beneficial to the country and beneficial to the people, they should not hesitate and do it boldly.

    Of course, for students who have not been admitted and cannot be employed temporarily, we should also rely on the strength of the masses and social organizations to give full play to the enthusiasm of the masses in running schools and hold various forms of schools. For example, employees of institutions, organizations, and enterprises can collectively run schools with their own money, farmers and urban residents can organize to collectively run schools, people who are enthusiastic about education and have the conditions to run schools individually can come forward to run schools, as well as various other vocational and cultural remedial schools, tutorial classes, self-study groups, etc., should be welcomed. Currently, these forms of schools have developed greatly. According to preliminary statistics in Henan Province, there are already twenty-three private high school classes, one thousand and eighty-three junior high school classes, and many private primary schools. The relatives of overseas Chinese in Fujian Province are now also preparing to run one hundred and five remedial classes and cultural classes for the children of overseas Chinese. The enthusiasm of the masses in running schools should be given full play, actively promoted, and the people's growing demands for cultural education should be met as much as possible.

    After the middle school enrollment work is over, some areas have become somewhat lax in their work with graduates. This is a problem that deserves attention. In particular, some counter-revolutionaries, rightists, and students with reactionary ideas are doing their best to spread provocative remarks to graduates who have not been admitted, vainly attempting to instigate students to make trouble. Some hooligans and swindlers in society impersonate government personnel and use the name of running schools and enrolling students to defraud students of their money. Therefore, all regions should continue to strengthen ideological education for students who have not been admitted. The rumors of bad elements provoking trouble must be exposed in a timely manner, and the behavior of hooligans cheating students must be severely cracked down on. It should be known that if we are slightly negligent and careless in this regard, enemies may take advantage of it.

    Currently, there is still a lot of work we should do. Students in cities who have not been admitted need to be organized to study on their own or participate in various labor activities. Graduates who go to the countryside must be reassured to engage in agricultural production, and regular ideological education work is still needed. All regions have paid relatively close attention to arranging for primary and secondary school graduates to participate in agricultural production in rural areas. However, some areas have not conducted detailed work earnestly and conscientiously. Some areas have not placed returning students in the main production areas. It should be pointed out that for graduates going to the countryside, they should first be allowed to learn how to farm, honestly, diligently. We must combine educated youth with physical labor, learn and master production knowledge in labor, become familiar with the lives of farmers, and gradually change their thoughts and feelings so that they can become new-type laborers who are both educated and able to produce. As for some areas where resettlement work has not yet been carried out, they should quickly and practically prepare for the work and step up the specific resettlement work. Those who have already settled students should further reassure the students to stay.

    All regions have put in a lot of effort in the education and placement of this year's primary and secondary school graduates, and have achieved great results. We hope that all regions will make persistent efforts and continue to do this work well.

    应该继续付出很大的力量
    各地高中和初中招生都已先后发榜，有一部分初中和高小的毕业生正准备迎接新的学习任务；没有升学的初中和高小毕业生做什么好呢？回答是：还有许多事情可做！
    今年各地对于中小学毕业生的升学和就业问题十分重视。对于他们的思想政治教育、劳动教育以及社会宣传教育工作进行较早，也比较广泛、深入、细致；同时对于毕业生回乡参加农业生产，一般地都做了调查，而且订出具体妥善的安置计划。因此，今年中小学应届毕业生、学生家长和干部都有了比较充分的思想准备。从各地情况来看，这一工作的效果是良好的。目前，有一大批未升学的城乡青年学生，纷纷响应国家的号召，走向农业生产战线。四川省已有三十多万家在农村的中小学生回到农村，河南省也有三十六万多毕业生回乡。许多地方乡政府、农业合作社热情地迎接、安排回乡的学生；不少学生家长对于没升学的子女设法自寻职业、帮助他们自学，有的并且积极鼓励子女到农村去参加生产。
    知识青年这样大规模地参加生产，在过去我国历史上是不可能有的。这表明了社会主义思想战胜着剥削阶级思想。这是一个伟大的思想革命。社会主义思想是把劳动看作人类赖以生存和推动社会向前发展的动力；社会主义教育是使人们掌握文化科学知识去改造自然，不断地提高劳动生产率，逐步提高人们的物质和文化生活。而剥削阶级则是卑视劳动的，他们把读书当做升官发财的阶梯。我们现在已经根本改变了旧社会的坏风气，树立了新社会的好风气。已经参加农业生产的青年学生，应当站稳脚根，不怕困难，同轻视体力劳动的剥削阶级的思想残余，同旧的习惯势力进行不调和的斗争；其他没有升学的学生，如果还没有参加生产劳动，现在也应该毅然决然地投到生产劳动中去。
    许多早已参加工业、农业、手工业生产和各种服务行业的中小学毕业生，他们在各个岗位上，战胜各种困难，以创造性的劳动取得了优异的成绩，博得了各方面的欢迎，也取得人民群众和国家给予的荣誉，许多人成为先进工作者和劳动模范。高小毕业生徐建春的事迹是许多人都知道的，她不仅当选为全国的农业劳动模范，而且今年当选了共青团中央委员。河南省禹县初中毕业生杨长江踏踏实实地学习农业先进技术，取得了岗地大面积的丰收，曾二十八次被评选为劳动模范。今年刚回乡的河南省开封专区数万名学生，投入了紧张的防汛斗争和参加各种生产劳动。通许县中学毕业生康效智在修堤堵口的防汛工作中，三昼夜没有离开河堤。许多社员们反映：“今年的毕业生回到农村以后，比往年大不相同。往年毕业生回到家里，三五成群地东游西窜，今年一到家里就下地生产。”这些事情说明，只要好好的劳动，人人都有光明的前途，都会受到群众的尊敬和称道。
    今年没有升学的中小学毕业生，除了家在农村的以及一部分城市学生安排到农村去以外，国家也在其他方面，如各种手工业、服务性行业中，尽可能做了安置。有些学生愉快地选择了这方面的职业，到饮食、理发、澡堂、商店、电车、汽车等各种行业中去当服务员、营业员、学徒。有些手工业者或有一技之长的家长，也带领他们自己的子女学习某一门技术。这些都是值得表扬的。只要是对人民有益的为人民服务的，任何一样工作都是光荣的。我们希望没有升学的初中和高小毕业生，有什么机会，能学什么手艺，只要有益于国家，有益于人民大众，就不必计较，大胆地去做。
    当然，对于没有升学而暂时又不能就业的学生，还应当依靠群众和社会团体的力量，充分发挥群众办学的积极性，举办各种形式的学校。例如机关、团体和企业的职工自己出钱集体办学，农民和城市居民组织起来集体办学，热心教育事业而又有条件个人办学的人出来举办学校，以及其他各种职业的文化的补习学校、补习班、自学小组等等，都应该受到欢迎。目前这些形式的学校有了大量的发展。据河南省初步统计，民办高中班已有二十三个，初中班一千零八十三个，还有许多民办小学。福建省华侨眷属现在也筹办了华侨子女补习班、文化班一百零五个。对于群众办学的积极性应当予以充分发挥，积极提倡，尽量满足群众日益增长的对文化教育的要求。
    在中学招生工作结束之后，有的地区对于毕业生的工作有些松懈。这是一个值得注意的问题。特别是目前有些反革命分子、右派分子以及有反动思想的学生，极力向没有升学的毕业生散布挑拨性的言论，妄想煽动学生闹事；社会上某些流氓骗子，冒充政府工作人员，借办学招生之名，骗取学生的钱财。因此，各地对于未升学的学生应当继续加强思想教育，对于坏分子挑拨是非的言论必须予以及时的揭露，对于流氓欺骗学生的行为必须予以严厉的打击。应当知道，如果我们在这方面稍有懈怠和疏忽，就可能有空子为敌人所利用。
    目前我们应该做的工作还很多。城市里没有升学的学生需要组织他们进行自学，或者参加各种劳动；到农村去的毕业生要使他们安心于农业生产，还需要进行经常的思想教育工作。各地对于安置中小学毕业生到农村参加农业生产，都是比较注意的。但是，有些地区没有切实认真地进行细致的工作。也有些地区没有把回乡的学生安置到主要生产方面。应当指出，对于下乡的毕业生，首先要让他们去学习种地，老老实实、勤勤恳恳地去种地。我们一定要使知识青年同体力劳动结合起来，在劳动中学习和掌握生产知识，熟悉农民的生活，并且逐步改变他们的思想情感，使他们成为名副其实的又有文化又会生产的新型劳动者。至于安置工作还没有进行的某些地区，更应当迅速地切实地做好准备工作，并且加紧进行具体的安置工作。已经把学生安置了的，要进一步使学生安心下去。
    对于今年中小学毕业生的教育和安置，各地付出了很大力量，已经取得了很大成绩。我们希望各地再接再厉，继续把这一工作做好。
