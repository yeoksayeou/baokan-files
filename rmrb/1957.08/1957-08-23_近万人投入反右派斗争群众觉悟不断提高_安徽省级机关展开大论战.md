　　Hefei, August 22nd (By our reporter) - The vigorous anti-Rightist struggle in Anhui Province is continuing to develop in depth. A major debate has unfolded in more than eighty units of the provincial organs, with nearly ten thousand people involved in the struggle. The Rightist elements exposed in the early stage of the anti-Rightist struggle have been refuted to the point of being logically indefensible and have begun to lower their heads and confess their guilt.
    Tong Chewu, Wu Bomin, and Wang Jinzhai, members of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League and the henchmen of the Zhang-Luo alliance in Anhui, and Li Xiangruo, chairman of the Hefei Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party and director of the Department of Justice, faithfully carried out Zhang-Luo's plan for large-scale development, setting fires everywhere at the grassroots level and inciting the masses. After their reactionary words and deeds were exposed and criticized in large and small meetings, they were unable to defend themselves and began to confess. Zhang Jie, a member of the Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK) and deputy director of the Department of Agriculture; Guo Chongyi, a member of the Provincial People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and deputy director of the Special Forestry Division of the Department of Forestry; Yang Zengxun, a technician of the Department of Water Resources; and Zhang Dongye, a standing committee member of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association (CNDCA), all extensively fabricated and slandered the achievements of agricultural production after cooperativization, the policy of unified purchase and sale, and the Party's policy on intellectuals. Zhang Jie also undermined the relationship between the Party and the peasants, attempting to instigate Zhang Huiting, an agricultural labor model and deputy to the National People's Congress, to represent the peasants in complaining about their suffering. Guo Chongyi took advantage of inspection opportunities to provoke peasants to oppose the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain. Zhang Dongye viciously attacked the new society for "lacking human touch," saying that "many peasants have a bellyful of grievances," "industrial and commercial circles dare not speak out," and "intellectuals with a little patriotism feel like they have a bone stuck in their throat." He also slandered the people of the whole country, saying: "Apart from the 12 million Party members, 20 million Youth League members, and some workers, more than 500 million people feel inferior and depressed." Cheng Shifan, director of the preparatory committee of the Provincial Science Popularization Association and vice chairman of the Provincial CPPCC, a Rightist element, even compared Party members and activists to "prison officials" of the Qin and Han dynasties, fabricating rumors and slandering the suppression of counter-revolutionaries (肃反运动), saying that Party members were suppressing and making things difficult for scientific and technical personnel. When the national Rightist elements were frantically attacking the Party, he was so carried away that he said the Communist Party could no longer "see victory" and that "the downfall of the Communist Party is only a matter of time."
    These Rightist elements had all been officials and worked in the reactionary government. Zhang Jie and Zhang Dongye were also ferocious landlords and local bullies, and Cheng Shifan was a person who had close organizational ties with Japanese spy agencies and the Kuomintang Central Bureau of Statistics secret service. Once their reactionary words and deeds and criminal history were exposed, they quickly became isolated among the masses.
    The provincial organs held two large debate meetings with more than a thousand people from various units participating, and criticized the Rightist elements Geng Renyong and Yang Zengxun.
    The masses, tempered by the struggle, have continuously improved their awareness, and the struggle has spread to all walks of life, with new Rightist elements being exposed one after another. In the cultural and art circles, the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles exposed an anti-Party clique headed by Dai Yue, the former deputy director of the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee, including more than a dozen Rightist elements; the anti-Party clique in the Provincial Cultural Bureau, with Chen Zhong, Zhang Xicai, and She Jianmin as its main members, also revealed its true colors. The press circles are criticizing the reactionary words and deeds of Lin Mu, a reporter from the Xinhua Branch, Li Kejie, the deputy head of the Rural Group of the Anhui Daily, and editors Lu Shan and Tan Baolin, a technician from the Provincial Broadcasting Station. The engineering and technical circles have confirmed that Zhang Zijing (an engineer) is the main leader of Cheng Shifan's reactionary clique. In addition, the Provincial Highway Transportation Bureau has also exposed Zhang Zhensheng's (the bureau's business consultant) reactionary words and deeds. The provincial financial and trade system has newly discovered eight Rightist elements.
    The anti-Rightist struggle in various parts of Anhui Province and in the Hefei municipal organs is also developing in depth. More than 20,000 people participating in the struggle are conducting persuasive struggle against Rightist elements such as Chen Tianren, Guo Xingan, Zhang Shanrui, Jiang Yuji, Zuo Guangcai, Geng Renyong, Wang Yunchou, Cheng Zhaojun, Hu Lü, Li Jiuwo, Zhu Chengzhi, Dai Yangchen, and Tao Linchuan. The anti-Rightist struggle in universities and colleges throughout the province is continuing among teachers and students staying on campus. Li Min, a teacher in the Marxist-Leninist teaching and research section of Anhui Normal College, has been proven to be a traitor to the Party and a military advisor to Rightist elements.

　　近万人投入反右派斗争群众觉悟不断提高
　　安徽省级机关展开大论战
    本报合肥22日电　安徽省的声势浩大的反右派斗争，正在向纵深继续发展。省级机关八十多个单位中展开了大论战，近万人投入了斗争。反右派斗争初期暴露的右派分子，已被批驳得理屈词穷，开始低头认罪。
    章罗联盟在安徽的爪牙、民盟安徽省委委员童车五、吴伯敏、王晋斋，和农工民主党合肥市工委主委、司法厅厅长李湘若，忠实地执行章罗的大发展计划，在基层到处点火，煽惑群众，这些反动言行，经大会小会揭露批判后，他们已无法辩解，开始作交代。民革省委委员、农业厅副厅长张节，省政协委员、林业厅特林处副处长郭崇毅，水利厅技术员杨曾训和民建安徽省工委会常委张东野，对合作化后的农业生产成绩、统购统销政策、党的知识分子政策等，都曾大肆造谣污蔑。张节还破坏党和农民的关系，企图唆使农业劳动模范、全国人民代表大会代表张会亭同志代表农民诉苦；郭崇毅则借视察机会挑拨农民反对粮食统购统销政策。张东野恶毒地攻击新社会“没有人情味”，说“许多农民有一肚子苦水”、“工商界不敢说话”、“稍有爱国心的知识分子，都是骨鲠在喉”，他并污蔑全国人民说：“全国除了一千二百万党员、二千多万团员以及若干工人外，还有五亿几千万人的心里感到自卑和消沉。”省科普协会筹委会主任、省政协副主席程士范这个右派分子，竟把党员和积极分子比作秦皇汉武时代的“治狱之吏”，造谣污蔑肃反运动，说党员在打击、刁难科学技术人员。他在全国右派分子猖狂向党进攻的时候，竟得意忘形地说共产党已经“看不到胜利了”、“共产党垮台也不过是时间问题”。
    这些右派分子都在反动政府当过官，做过事，张节和张东野还是凶恶的大地主、大恶霸，程士范则是一个和日本间谍机关、国民党中统特务机关有密切组织关系的人。他们的反动言行和罪恶历史一经揭露，便在群众中很快陷于孤立。
    省级机关曾召开了两次有各单位千余人参加的大辩论会，对右派分子耿仁勇和杨曾训进行了批判。
    经过斗争锻炼的群众，觉悟不断提高，斗争向各行各业展开，新的右派分子纷纷被揭露出来。在文化艺术界，省文联揭露了一个以前省委文教部副部长戴岳为首的包括十几个右派分子的反党集团；省文化局以陈仲、张熙才、佘建民为主要成员的反党集团也露了原形。新闻界正在批驳新华分社记者林牧、安徽日报农村组副组长李克节和编辑鲁山、省广播电台的技术员谭保林等的反动言行。工程技术界证实张子敬（工程师）是程士范反动集团的主将。此外，省公路运输管理局对张振声（该局业务顾问）的反动言行也进行了揭露。省财贸系统新查出了八个右派分子。
    安徽省各地、合肥市级机关的反右派斗争，也正在深入开展。参加斗争的两万多人，正对陈天任、郭兴安、张善瑞、姜玉济、左光彩、耿仁勇、王运筹、程肇钧、胡侣、李九我、诸诚之、戴仰辰、陶瀶川等右派分子进行说理斗争。全省专科以上学校的反右派斗争，正在留校的师生中继续进行。安徽师范学院马列主义教研室教员李敏，已被证明是党的叛徒、右派分子的军师。
