    Criticizing Li Baifeng
  　Chen Jingrong
    The July issue of "People's Literature" contains an "Open Letter to Poets" by Li Baifeng. This letter, appearing in the "Writer's Forum" column in the first position, caught my attention. However, after reading it, I must angrily tell all readers: this is a poisonous weed, a very malicious poisonous weed.
    Li Baifeng, like a wolf in grandma's clothing, pretends to be very concerned about our poetry, and first offers some pleasantries, then eloquently releases his venom: "Poets, respected comrades!" You are so pitiful because "the creation of poetry is restricted to such a narrow field, poets have defined the scope of writing for themselves, and are spinning around in this small world"!—Who "restricted" the field, Li Baifeng did not say explicitly. However, the "scope of writing" is "self-defined" by the poets, which shows that the poets not only have no resistance to the "restriction" but have also developed a slave mentality. But in Li Baifeng's pen, poets are not only in this pitiful state, but also have a fierce side that bullies the weak and fears the strong: "You... have chosen not so many methods of writing poetry, and regard it as a measure of all poetry... like Procrustes in Greek mythology, putting all poetry on his bed and 'lengthening' or 'shortening' it." Needless to say, after "your" processing, "all" poetry will be destroyed and strangled.
    Readers may find it strange that Li Baifeng, who is also considered a "poet," wrote a letter to us (his so-called "you") with such sweet titles as "respected poet comrades," saying "I am moved and encouraged by you" and "I have infinite admiration for you," how could he then so blatantly slander the vast number of poetry authors? Am I taking things out of context, or exaggerating? Or am I failing to appreciate kindness, mistaking a friend for an enemy, and wrongly accusing a good person? Please read on. Li Baifeng quoted Marx: "I have the right to reveal my spiritual face... you praise nature's pleasant variety, its endless treasures. You do not ask roses and violets to emit the same fragrance, but the richest of all things—the spirit—is only allowed to exist in one form? I am a humorist, but the law orders me to write seriously. I am bold, but the law orders my style to be cautious and humble. Gray, gray, more gray, this is the only officially prescribed color. Every dewdrop illuminated by the sun shines with endless colors, but the sun of the spirit can illuminate so many different people and things, and it is only allowed to produce one color, the official color."
    Li Baifeng said: "Of course, Marx was addressing the then-German 'latest censorship regulations,' but can't we refer to it today?" Here, readers cannot help but wonder: since it is clear that Marx's words were directed at the dark class enemies, why bring it up for reference and further reference within our poetry circles today? Of course, Li Baifeng must make full use of Marx, so he quoted another passage: "The impersonal university writers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, with their stiff wigs and pedantry to get ahead, with their meticulous papers visible only under a microscope, this group of people, lined up between the people and the spirit, life and science, freedom and man, it is this group of incompetent writers who created our literature." Immediately afterwards, Li Baifeng said: "—It is these people and the poems they write that make us feel that although our poetry circles have achievements, they are not so in line with the vibrant requirements of the times." Here, it is no longer a matter of twisting and turning for "reference," he has directly pointed his finger and said: "It is 'you' who have committed the crimes of poetry, 'it is 'you' who are hindering the development of literature and art, 'it is 'you' who are spreading the only, officially prescribed 'official color.'" This makes it easy to see what opposing positions he and "you" are standing on.
    Li Baifeng felt that using Marx's mouth to scold Marxists was not satisfying enough. So he went further, pointing out that "the consequence of Emperor Wen of the Han Dynasty's advocating Confucianism and dismissing the hundred schools of thought was to make creation wither," calling on us to study the "era and social reasons" why Han Fu was so uniform, and to take it as a lesson from the past!
    Li Baifeng said: "Respected comrades, please forgive me for not being good at 'interpreting the law strictly and weaving charges,' maybe I have said some unpleasant things..." It should be admitted that "interpreting the law strictly and weaving charges" cannot be considered, it is just "trying to cover up."
    He said: "We do not have the bourgeoisie's (the function of this decoration, everyone can understand—note by Rong) set of censorship systems, nor do we have their hideous and almost barbaric publication laws, but we do have..." What do we have? —"We have some deeply prejudiced editors." "Although we don't have 'RAPP' and 'VAPP,' we do have..." What do we have? —"We have the editors' 'list of what they are familiar with or what they like.'" That's all.
    It is not difficult to understand that Li Baifeng holds deep hatred for the editors. Because he believes that they are "gatekeepers"; needless to say, they are all "dogmatists." They not only have a "list," but also "hold too much power of life and death," they "strangle" "problematic things for which they are responsible." "Therefore, there are not many poets in our newspapers and magazines (in his other poetic saying: "similar to the lonely morning star"), but in fact, the poets we 'inherited' from the old society are far more than this...". As for the new forces, the encounter is even more painful. Li Baifeng used Lu Xun's famous metaphor to describe the difficult situation of revolutionary literature and art under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang: "As for young poets who want to rush from the bottom to the top, it seems no easier than a seedling rushing out from under the heavy pressure of stones." Li Baifeng's fundamental view of today's literary and art circles is already clear. The natural conclusion is also very clear: Li Baifeng and his like should revolt against these "Emperors Wen of Han" and the "Confucians" they revere, revolt against that "official color," revolt against those "impersonal" academic and literary warlords, and revolt against that cruel "big stone."
    What puzzles me is this: why is Li Baifeng still so afraid that his article will not be published? Please see his pitiful plea:
      "I know that this letter has little chance of being published, as a professor in the Northwest said: 'The spring breeze does not reach Yumen Pass'! When friends in Beijing are talking about 'early spring cold' and 'early spring warmth,' I hope we can all listen to Chairman Mao's teachings and allow a full 'release'; however: 'The weather is changeable at the beginning of warm days, and it's hard to take care of oneself,' perhaps it can represent the mood of some intellectuals?"
    It would be good to let Li Baifeng's "friends" speak out his true feelings for him.
    But I want to say, Li Baifeng, stop pretending!

### 斥李白凤

专栏：

    斥李白凤
  　陈敬容
    “人民文学”7月号有一篇李白凤的“写给诗人们底公开信”。这信登在“作家论坛”栏第一篇的地位，引起了我的注意。但是，我读了之后，不得不愤怒地告诉所有的读者：这是一株毒草，很恶毒的毒草。
    李白凤像狼装外婆的样子，伪装十分关怀我们的诗歌，还首先来一番客套，然后就滔滔不绝地放出他的毒液来：“诗人们，敬爱的同志们！”你们太可怜了，因为“诗歌的创作被限制在如此狭窄的领域里，诗人们替自己划定了写作范围，就在这样的小天地里回旋着”！——领域是谁“限制”的呢，李白凤没有明说。不过“写作范围”是诗人们“自己划定”的，可见诗人们对
  “限制”不但毫无反抗，而且已经养成奴性了。但在李白凤笔下，诗人又不仅是这副可怜相，还有怕硬欺软的凶恶的一面：“你们，……选定了不那末太多的诗歌的写作方法，把它看成衡量一切诗歌的尺度……像希腊神话故事里的柏鲁克拉士那样，把一切诗歌都放到自己的床上，加以‘拉长’或‘截短’。”不用说，经过“你们”这番加工，“一切”诗歌就都被毁灭、被扼杀了。
    读者也许会觉得奇怪，也算个“诗人”的李白凤，用“敬爱的诗人同志们”这样甜蜜的称呼，给我们（他所谓“你们”）写信，既说了“我被你们感动、鼓舞”，又说了“我对你们有无限的钦佩”，怎么可能接下去就这样赤裸裸地污蔑广大的诗歌作者呢？是不是我断章取义，或者是夸大其辞？或者是不识好歹，误友为敌，冤枉好人？请看下去吧。李白凤引用马克思：“我有权利露出我的精神面貌……你们赞美自然界那种悦人的千变万化，那种无穷无尽的宝藏。你们不要求玫瑰花和紫罗兰发出同样的香气，但是，一切中最丰富的东西——精神，却只准生存在一个形式里？我是幽默家，但是法律却命令我要写得严肃。我是大胆的，但是法律却命令我的风格要谨慎谦卑。灰色、灰色，更多的灰色，这是唯一钦定的色彩。太阳照映着的每一滴露珠，都闪耀着无穷无尽的色彩，但是，精神的太阳可以照彻这样多不同的人与物，而它只准许产生一种色彩，官方色彩。”
    李白凤说：“自然，马克思是针对当时德国‘最新审查条例，说的，但在我们今天，不是也可以参考参考吗？”这里，读者不免要发生疑问：既然明知马克思的话是针对黑暗的阶级敌人而发，为什么要在我们今天诗歌界内部提出来参考而又参考呢？当然，李白凤是必须充分利用马克思的，所以他又引用了一段：“十七、八世纪的无个性的大学里的著作家，连带他们底僵硬的假发及出人头地的迂腐，同他们细密得显微镜下才看得出的论文，就是这群人，排列在人民和精神、生活和科学、自由和人之间，正是这群没有才干的作家创造了我们的文学。”紧接着，李白凤就说：“——正是这些人和他们所写的这种诗，使得我们感觉到我们诗歌界虽然有成绩却并不那么合乎时代要求的生气勃勃”。这里，就不再是什么扭扭捏捏的“参考”问题了，他已经直率地指着鼻子说：“正是”“你们”作了诗歌的罪人，“正是”“你们”在阻碍着文艺的发展，“正是”“你们”在散布着唯一的、钦定的“官方色彩”。这也就不难看出，他和“你们”是站在怎样对立的立场上了。
    李白凤觉得，借马克思的嘴来骂马克思主义者，太不过瘾了。于是他更进一步，指出“汉文帝崇儒术而罢黜百家的后果就是使得创作雕敝”，叫我们研究汉赋所以千篇一律的“时代与社会的原因”，引为前车之鉴！
    李白凤说：“敬爱的同志们，请原谅我不善于‘深文周纳’，也许说了一些使人不很愉快的话……”应该承认，“深文周纳”也还不能算的，只是“欲盖弥彰”罢了。
    他说：“我们没有资产阶级（这个装饰的作用，大家都能理解的——容按）那一套检查制度，也没有他们那样面目狰狞而且近乎野蛮的出版法，可是我们却有……”有什么东西呢？——“我们却有着一些成见甚深的编辑”。“我们虽然没有‘拉普’和‘瓦普’，可是我们却有……”什么呢？——“我们却有编辑们的一份‘自己所熟悉或自己所喜欢的名单’”。如此而已。
    李白凤当然要对编辑们抱着深仇大恨，这是不难理解的。因为他认定他们是“把关者”；不用说，也都是些“教条主义者”。他们不仅有一份“名单”，而且“掌握着太多了的生杀予夺的大权”，他们“扼杀”“有问题的、要负责任的东西”。“因此我们的报章杂志上的诗人是不多的（用他另一句诗意的说法：“类乎孤独的晨星”），而实际我们从旧社会‘接收’下来的诗人却远比这多得多……。”至于新生力量呢，那遭遇就更痛苦了。李白凤用鲁迅描写国民党反动统治下革命文艺的困难处境的著名比喻说：“至于要想从下面冲到上面来的年轻诗人，似乎并不比从石头的重压下冲出来的幼苗更省力”。李白凤对今天文艺界的根本观点，已经再明白也没有了。当然而然的结论也是很清楚的：应该让李白凤们来革这些“汉文帝”及其所尊崇的“儒们”的命，革那“官方色彩”的命，革那“无个性的”学阀们、文阀们的命，革那残酷的“大石头”的命。
    使我不解的倒是这一点：李白凤为什么还要那样地害怕他的文章不能发表呢？请看他的可怜的低诉：
      “我知道这封信很少有发表的可能，正如西北一位教授说的：‘春风不度玉门关’呵！当北京的朋友们正在大谈其‘春寒’‘春暖’的时候，我希望我们都能听从毛主席的教导，允许充分地‘放’一下；然而：‘乍暖还寒时候，最难将息’，也许可以代表一部分知识分子的心情吧？”
    应该让李白凤的“朋友们”替他说一说他的真正的心情才好。
    但是我要说，李白凤你不要装蒜了！
