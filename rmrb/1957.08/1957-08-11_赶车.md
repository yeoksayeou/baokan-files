　　Catching the Bus
　　Li Hanzhu

　　In this mountain city, far and near, people are all asleep; only the expert's window is still open, and the milky white light shines from inside, like eyes staring at this rainy night. Xiao Liu sits at the door; his diamond-like eyes reveal a kind of uneasiness. Raindrops hit the ground, splashing mud, turning the large clumps of oriental chrysanthemums in the garden into a large pockmarked face. Only at this time would Xiao Liu complain that the heavens were like a leaky pot, endlessly dripping, dripping, dripping until when? He thought of the story the expert had told him about refining stones to mend the sky. …

　　The expert had rushed here from the province a week ago; the surveying team here desperately needed him. Before he came, a speech he gave at the Provincial United Front Work Department was published in the newspaper. Because he was a famous figure, his "colleagues" read it first thing when they saw him. Rather than saying he was making suggestions, it was more like he was complaining. Everyone felt that he was too extreme, possibly that he was somewhat dissatisfied with the Party. However, during these days working here, everyone also felt that his work ethic was worthy of praise.

　　"Expert, go to sleep. Tomorrow you still have to work hard," Xiao Liu said, lifting the curtain for the third time, as if the expert didn't know he had to work hard tomorrow. To be honest, Xiao Liu felt a little embarrassed to say it so many times. However, caring about the expert's health was also his responsibility as a liaison.

　　"Mmm," the expert responded habitually with his nose, without even raising his head, saying, "It will be finished soon, finished and then I'll sleep."

　　The expert's plump figure filled the leather chair, his hands separated and placed flat on the desk, the tip of his pen scratching, his glasses flashing light, his nose almost licking the paper under his pen. Judging from the atmosphere on his face, he was a little different tonight, and Xiao Liu sensed it when he was reading the day's newspaper. Later, seeing him throw the newspaper down, put his hands behind his back, hunch over, and pace back and forth in the room, his thick and long eyebrows always raised, and then later, he lay on the desk and started writing something.

　　The expert liked to fall asleep in the sound of rain, and he always went to bed early on rainy days. The more work there was, the more Xiao Liu hoped it would rain, so that the expert could get a good night's sleep. Why did the expert suddenly change his habits? he thought.

　　"Expert,..." Xiao Liu came in again.

　　"Mmm," he responded with his nose again, still without raising his head. "Just a little bit more, almost finished writing. Oh, Xiao Liu, please make me a cup of coffee with sugar."

　　"It's not good to drink coffee before bed, how about a cup of white sugar water?"

　　"Okay, okay. That's fine too."

　　The expert drank the white sugar water, and after a long, long time, Xiao Liu came in again.

　　"Expert, it's already past two o'clock." This time, Xiao Liu was really anxious.

　　"Oh, is it two o'clock? I've finished writing too."

　　In the early morning, the expert got up very early, as if he had gone to bed on time last night. He turned on the desk lamp and sat in that leather chair again; he was copying something he had written last night: the tip of his pen scratching, his nose almost licking the paper under his pen, his glasses flashing light. After copying, he put it in an envelope, and then went to the coat rack, hurriedly put on his raincoat.

　　The rain was pouring down, as if deliberately making things difficult, falling harder and harder. The expert managed to get to the post office, but the day's mailbag had already been sent to the station. So, he turned around and left.

　　In the meantime, Xiao Liu brought in washing water and breakfast. Seeing that the expert was not there, he was so anxious that he spun around in circles, not knowing what to do, almost bursting into tears.

　　The rain was still pouring down like a waterfall, the roads turned into small rivers, stepping down, one foot deep, one foot shallow. The expert was running with difficulty, staggering, a bit like a drunkard being chased. Several times he almost fell, and he suddenly hugged a telephone pole; sometimes a poplar tree supported him. The station came a sound of *dang dang dang*, making him so anxious that he fell twice in a row, but he didn't care, didn't even touch himself after getting up, and ran off again, even more fiercely, as if to make up for the time he had wasted falling and getting up.

　　The expert returned from the station, looking as if he had just been pulled out of the water, his clothes sticking tightly to his skin, water dripping from his whole body. He took off his nearsighted glasses and put them aside, then used a large towel to wipe from his hair all the way down. Xiao Liu flusteredly took off his clothes and shoes. The expert reminisced and said:

　　"If I had been just one step slower, I would have definitely missed the first bus."

　　Xiao Liu was silent, a little unhappy.

　　"I started rushing for this morning's first bus last night," the expert explained, pointing to the papers on the table.

　　Xiao Liu looked, and it was indeed the few papers that the expert had written last night, the writing very scribbled, and smeared very messily, with circles and dots, looking just like a pockmarked face.

　　"This is yesterday's newspaper." The expert took a newspaper from the drawer. "What nonsense! Some people say that we have not achieved any results in these years, obliterating our efforts, they want to take the American road, establish some kind of Senate... I, I cannot not speak out!..."

　　The expert became more and more excited.

　　Xiao Liu couldn't figure out why for a moment, but looking at the expression on the expert's face, and hearing that some people wanted to take the American road, anger rose in his heart.

    赶车
    李汉柱
    在这山城里，远远近近，人们都睡了；唯有专家的一扇窗户还开着，乳白色的灯光从里面射出来，宛如凝视着这雨夜的眼睛。小刘坐在门口；他那钻石般的眸子，流露出一种不安。雨点打在地上，浆泥溅起，把园子里的大朵大朵的东洋菊，变成了一张大麻脸。只有在这个时候，小刘才会埋怨老天像口漏了的锅，没终没了的嘀嗒到什么时候？他想起了专家给他讲的炼石补天的故事。……
    专家是一周前从省里赶来的，这里的勘察队非常需要他。到这之前，报上登了他在省统战部的一篇发言，因为他是个著名人物，所以“同行”们一见到就首先读了。与其说他是在提意见，毋宁说他是在发牢骚。大家都觉得他过于偏激了，可能是他对党有些不满。但，在这里工作的这些日子，大家又都觉得他的工作精神很值得表扬。
      “专家，睡吧。明天你还要突击工作哩。”小刘已经是第三次掀开帘子进来说，就像专家不知道自己明天还要突击工作似的。老实说，说多了，小刘也觉得有些不好意思。不过，关心专家的健康，又是他当通讯员的责任。
    “唔唔，”专家习惯地用鼻子应着，连头也没抬，说：“很快就完啦，完了就睡。”
    专家发胖的身材把皮椅挤得满满的，两手分开平放在桌面上，笔尖儿沙沙地响着，眼镜闪着灯光，他的鼻尖几乎舐住了他笔下的那张纸。从他脸上的气氛看来，他今夜是有些异样的，还当他读着当天的报纸的时候，小刘就感觉到了。后来，看到他把报一摔，背起双手，驼着背，在房里踱来踱去，粗而长的眉毛老是一扬一扬的，又后来，他就伏在桌面上写起什么来了。
    专家喜欢在雨声中入睡，雨天他总是睡得很早。工作越多，小刘就越盼望下雨，好叫专家夜里美美地睡一觉。专家为啥突然改变了自己的习惯呢？他想。
      “专家，……”小刘又进来了。
      “唔唔，”还是用鼻子应着，还是连头也没抬。“还差一点，马上就写完了。哦，小刘，请你给我冲杯咖啡糖。”
    “睡前喝咖啡不好，给你杯白糖水吧？”
      “行行。也好。”
    专家喝了白糖水，又隔了好久好久，小刘才又进来。
      “专家，已经下两点了。”这一次，小刘真的有些急了。
      “哦，两点了吗？我也写完啦。”
    清晨，专家起得很早，仿佛他昨夜是按时睡觉了的。他打开台灯，依然坐在那张皮椅上；是誊抄他昨夜写的什么东西：笔尖儿沙沙响着，鼻尖几乎舐住了他笔下的那张纸，眼镜闪着灯光。誊抄完了，就把它装到信封里，然后走到衣架前，匆忙地穿上雨衣。
    雨哗哗下着，像故意为难，越下越大了。专家好容易才来到邮局，可是，当天的邮包早已送到车站去了。于是，他转身就走。
    这其间，小刘打来洗脸水，又拿来了早点。看见专家不在，着急得团团转，不知怎么好，几乎掉下泪来。
    雨，照旧像瓢儿泼的一样，道路成了一条小河，踩下去，深一脚，浅一脚。专家吃力地跑着，踉踉跄跄的，有点儿像一个被人追赶着的醉汉。好几次险些儿摔倒了，他猛然抱住一根电线杆；有时是一株白杨撑住了他。车站传来一片噹噹噹的打点声，急得他连连摔了两跤，但他毫不在乎，爬起来连摸也不摸一下，拔起腿又跑，甚至跑得更凶，就像要弥补他摔倒又爬起所耽误的时间。
    专家从车站回来了，像刚从水里捞出似的，衣服紧粘着肉，浑身往下流水。他把近视眼镜取下来，搁在一旁，然后用一条大毛巾，从头发上一直抹下来。小刘手忙脚乱地给他脱衣服，脱鞋子。专家回味着说：
    “我只要慢一步，就准要误了第一班车。”
    小刘不语，有些不高兴。
    “我昨夜就开始赶今早的第一班车了。”专家指着桌面上解释道。
    小刘一看，正是专家昨夜笔下的那几张纸，字很草，又涂得很花，有圈有点，活像张大麻脸。
    “这是昨天的报。”专家从抽斗里拿出一张报纸。“什么话！有人说我们这几年没有成绩，抹煞我们的努力，他们要走美国的路，建立什么上议院……。我，我不能不讲话！……”
    专家越说越激动了。
    小刘一时弄不清这是为什么，可是他看着专家脸上的表情，听到有人要走美国的路，心里就生起了怒火。
