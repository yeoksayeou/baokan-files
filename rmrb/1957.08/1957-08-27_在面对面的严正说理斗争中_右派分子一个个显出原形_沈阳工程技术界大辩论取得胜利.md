Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 26th. (Xinhua News Agency reporter Shen Junhai, Xu Jiazhu) Reported: Twenty-one factories, eight basic construction units, five scientific and technological research institutions in Shenyang, as well as eight design institutes belonging to the central ministries and Liaoning Province, have launched a struggle against bourgeois rightists among engineering and technical personnel. Currently, a group of rightist elements and rightist groups have been exposed in Shenyang's engineering and technical circles. The anti-rightist struggle in design and scientific and technological research departments, where engineering and technical personnel are concentrated, has achieved significant victories.

According to statistics from design units, among the rightist elements exposed in Shenyang's engineering and technical circles, 76% come from landlord, rich peasant, and capitalist families, and 78% were previously targets of suppression or had family members who were struggled against or suppressed. These rightist elements spread various reactionary fallacies during ordinary times and during the period of great blooming and contending, instigated the masses everywhere, and attacked the Communist Party. They attempted to abolish the Communist Party's leadership over the scientific and technological community, put forward slogans such as "laymen cannot lead experts," and tried to provoke the relationship between intellectuals and the Communist Party, attacked the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, vilified Communist Party veteran cadres, and promoted the so-called "democracy" and "freedom" of capitalist countries, and so on.

In the face-to-face, stern reasoning struggle, these rightist elements one by one revealed their true colors. Various design departments and scientific research institutions in Shenyang have successively held dozens of large and small debates. The Institute of Metal Research and the Institute of Forestry and Soil Science affiliated to the Chinese Academy of Sciences jointly held four large-scale debates, with 500 to 700 scientific researchers participating in each. Many engineering and technical personnel used their personal experiences to refute the rightist elements' slander that the Communist Party does not value scientific and technological talents. Scientists Shi Changxu and Guo Kexin, who had recently returned from capitalist countries such as the United States, explained from their own observations that scientific talents in capitalist countries, contrary to our country, are not valued, and science in capitalist countries is utilized by large financial groups and monopoly groups. Workers and technicians from the Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant used the fact that the plant went from nothing to something, from small to large, to refute the fallacy that "the Communist Party cannot lead technology." When this factory was first liberated, it had been severely damaged. At that time, eight old workers, under the leadership of the Communist Party, led the workers to restore the factory. Now this factory is able to produce a large number of heavy mining machines. Rightist element and technician Liu Mingjie of the Nonferrous Metallurgical Design Institute touted himself as coming from a peasant family, saying that after returning to his hometown, he found that the peasants' "lives had declined." This design institute invited the township head and the director of the agricultural production cooperative from Liu Mingjie's hometown to attend the debate at the design institute. They recounted the improvement in the peasants' lives after agricultural collectivization, tearing off Liu Mingjie's disguise.

The result of persisting in reasoning struggle is that the reactionary words and deeds of rightist elements in the engineering and technical circles are clearly exposed in front of the masses. According to understanding from various units, each debate brings forth a group of activists in the anti-rightist struggle. Currently, the anti-rightist ranks in Shenyang's engineering and technical circles are constantly growing.

    在面对面的严正说理斗争中
　　右派分子一个个显出原形
　  沈阳工程技术界大辩论取得胜利
    新华社沈阳26日电　新华社记者沈俊海、徐家柱报道：沈阳有二十一个工厂，八个基本建设施工单位，五个科学技术研究机关，以及中央各部和辽宁省所属的八个设计院，已经在工程技术人员中间展开了反击资产阶级右派的斗争。现在，沈阳工程技术界已经揭露出一批右派分子和右派集团；工程技术人员集中的设计和科学技术研究等部门的反右派斗争已经获得了显著战果。
    沈阳工程技术界揭发出来的右派分子，据在设计单位的统计，家庭出身是地主、富农、资本家的占76％，本人曾经是肃反对象、家庭成员被斗争、被镇压的占78％。这些右派分子在平时和大鸣大放期间，散播了形形色色的反动谬论，到处煽动群众，向共产党进攻。他们企图取消共产党对科学技术界的领导，提出了“外行不能领导内行”等的口号，极力挑拨知识分子同共产党的关系，攻击肃反运动，丑化共产党员老干部，并且宣扬资本主义国家所谓的“民主”和“自由”等等。
    在面对面的严正的说理斗争中，这些右派分子一个个地显出了原形。沈阳市各个设计部门、科学研究机构已经先后开了几十次大小辩论会。中国科学院所属金属研究所和林业土壤研究所一共合并开了四次大辩论会，每次都有五百名到七百名科学研究人员参加。许多工程技术人员用亲身经历驳斥了右派分子诬蔑共产党不重视科学技术人材的谬论，从美国等资本主义国家回国不久的科学家师昌绪、郭可信都以亲眼所见，说明了资本主义国家的科学人材同我国正相反，是不被重视的，资本主义国家的科学是被大财阀、大垄断集团所利用的。沈阳矿山机器厂工人和技术人员用本厂从无到有、从小到大的事实，驳斥了“共产党不能领导技术”的谬论。这个厂刚解放时已遭到严重破坏，当时八个老工人在共产党领导下，带领工人们恢复工厂，现在这个厂已经能够生产大量的重型矿山机器。有色冶金设计院右派分子、技术员刘明阶标榜他自己是农民出身，说他回乡以后发现农民“生活降低”。这个设计院就邀请刘明阶本乡乡长和农业生产合作社主任到设计院出席辩论会。他们讲述了农业合作化以后农民生活提高的情况，撕下了刘明阶的伪装。
    坚持说理斗争的结果，使工程技术界中右派分子的反动言行，在群众面前清晰地暴露出来。据到各单位了解，每经过一次辩论，便涌现出一批反右派斗争的积极分子。现在，沈阳工程技术界反右派的队伍还在不断壮大中。
