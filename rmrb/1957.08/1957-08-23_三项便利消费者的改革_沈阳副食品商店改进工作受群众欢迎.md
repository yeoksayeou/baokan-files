    Three Reforms to Benefit Consumers
　　Shenyang Subsidiary Food Stores Improve Operations, Welcomed by the Masses
    Recently, many subsidiary food stores in Shenyang have implemented three reforms to benefit consumers.
    Elimination of the "Card Sales Method." The "Card Sales Method" required customers to first buy a card at a small window, whether they were buying a handful of green onions or a head of garlic, and then take the card to buy the vegetables. This was annoying because people had to queue to buy the card and then queue again at the vegetable counter, especially when it was crowded. Now, customers pay and receive their goods directly, which is more convenient for everyone, and reduces some procedures for the stores.
    Allowing Customers to Choose. In the past, stores kept the vegetables behind the counter, and customers were only allowed to have the salesperson pick them out, with consumers only able to stand outside the counter and look from afar, not allowed to choose freely. Therefore, many people preferred to spend more money to buy vegetables from street vendors. Now, many stores have broken with convention and put the vegetables on the counter for customers to choose freely. Because buying vegetables is more convenient, sales have increased. For example, the No. 1 Store in the Nan Shi District used to sell only 10,000 jin of vegetables a day, but now it can sell 22,000 jin.
    Pricing Based on Quality. In the past, when buying vegetables in Shenyang, the price was the same for a basket or a hamper, regardless of whether the vegetables were good, inferior, or rotten, and they were sold together at the same price. Moreover, the price was the same in the morning and evening. As a result, some vegetables were not discounted in the evening and were allowed to rot. Recently, the commercial departments have proposed changing the fixed price system and delegating a certain amount of pricing flexibility to the sales teams. This allows them to price based on quality, allowing customers to choose, and eliminating disputes. In this way, people with higher purchasing power can buy higher-quality goods at a higher price, and people with lower purchasing power can buy cheaper goods. This also reduces the wastage of goods, which is beneficial to both the country and the people.

    三项便利消费者的改革
　　沈阳副食品商店改进工作受群众欢迎
    沈阳许多副食品商店最近进行了三件便利消费者的改革。
    取消“卡片售货法”。“卡片售货法”是无论买一把葱一头蒜，都得先到一个小窗口买卡片，然后再拿卡片去买菜，在人多的时候，买卡片要排队，到蔬菜柜台前又要排队，实在叫人烦恼。现在改为一手给钱一手取货，大家都感到方便，商店也减少了一些手续。
    可以挑选。过去商店把蔬菜都放在柜台后边，买菜时只许营业员给拿，消费者只能站在柜外遥遥相望，不准自由挑选。因此很多人宁肯多花钱到小贩那里买菜。现在不少商店打破常规，把蔬菜从货架上摆到柜台上来，随便挑选。因为买菜方便，销售量增加了，如南市区第一商店过去一天只能卖一万斤菜，现在就能卖到两万两千斤。
    按质论价。过去在沈阳买菜，都是一筐一篓一个价，不论好、次或是烂菜都同等论价搭配出卖，而且早晚一个市价，结果有些菜放到晚间又不肯降价出售就听任烂掉。最近商业部门提出了改变死牌价的办法，把一定的作价机动权下放到营业小组，这样就可以按质论价，由人选择，也不用争吵了。这样购买力较高的人可以较高的价买到质量好的商品，购买力较低的人也可以买到便宜货，商品也因而减少了损耗，于国于民都有好处。
