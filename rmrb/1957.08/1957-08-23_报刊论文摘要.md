    Settling the Score with the Bourgeois Rightists

    China's socialist revolution is being carried out through peaceful means. However, we have never said that peaceful means are not class struggle. The Party has never paralyzed itself. It is inconceivable that bourgeois rightists would willingly accept the elimination of their class. Once there is an opportunity, bourgeois rightists will reveal their true colors after drinking a cup of realgar wine. The rectification movement of our Party, in their view, is such an opportunity, a godsend. They have retracted all their promises, the most important of which is the attempt to get rid of the Party's leadership and reverse the direction of socialism. The "ambition" of the bourgeois rightists to compete with us for a long time to come will not disappear. Now that they have come out to compete with us, we must settle the score with them. This competition must be carried out through a mass debate involving the whole people. The series of questions raised by the bourgeois rightists precisely prompt us to use the Marxist theoretical weapon to refute them one by one. This is a struggle against the rightists, and at the same time, it is a great military exercise for our own people. If we win this struggle, China's socialist construction will proceed more smoothly. (Excerpt from "Study" semi-monthly, No. 16, 1957, Wang Xiaofeng: "National Debate")

    No Mass Character Without Party Spirit

    The rightists oppose the mass character to the Party spirit, trying to make people believe that with the Party, the newspaper cannot be run well. In fact, we have always believed that the Party spirit of the newspaper is consistent with the mass character, and the Party spirit of the newspaper is the concentrated expression of the mass character. The interests of the people are the interests of the Party. Apart from the interests of the people, the Party has no selfish interests. The Party's line, policies, and principles are formulated based on the requirements and wishes of the vast majority of the masses, and are the concentrated expression of the interests of the masses. There is no mass character without Party spirit. Only when the newspaper has a clear Party spirit stance can it correctly reflect the people's nature and express the people's nature. The rightists talk about mass character away from Party spirit, in fact, they are promoting their bourgeois private goods in the name of mass character.

    What "Lesson" Does Lei Haizong Want Us to "Make Up"?

    Lei Haizong said: "China's social sciences do not have a capitalist stage, because China has not experienced capitalism in history. Before liberation, although we learned a little from foreign countries, it was very little, only decorative in nature, and we did not learn it thoroughly. There is no such thing in the social consciousness of Chinese people. ... Today, we are required to inherit the cultural heritage of mankind in the past, and develop new social sciences on this basis. It is impossible without studying these." According to these absurd statements, it seems that without going through the stage of capitalism, no country can develop its own science, and must beg for capitalism. In his opinion, the culture of the socialist camp seems to be so poor that it has nothing to offer. Isn't this clearly asking us to lose all confidence in Marxism, in China's rich cultural heritage, and in the rapidly developing socialist science and culture, and to let us Chinese people who have "not experienced the stage of capitalism" completely surrender to bourgeois social sciences, so that bourgeois social sciences can be restored in China, and even make Chinese society "make up" for the stage of capitalism?

　　报刊论文摘要
    和资产阶级右派一决胜负
    我国的社会主义革命是通过和平方式来进行的。但是，我们从来没有说过和平方式就不是阶级斗争。党从来没有麻痹过自己。资产阶级右派对于自己这个阶级的消灭就那么心甘情愿是不能设想的。一旦遇有空子可钻，资产阶级右派分子就会一杯雄黄酒下肚：原形毕露。像我们党的整风运动，在他们看来就是空子，就是千载难逢的良机。他们收回了一切诺言，其中最主要的是妄图摆脱党的领导和扭转社会主义的方向。资产阶级右派分子妄想和我们较一长短的“雄心”在今后一个相当长的时间里是不会泯灭的。现在他们出来和我们较量了，我们就要和他们决一胜负。这种较量必须通过全民大辩论来进行。资产阶级右派向我们提出来的一大串的问题，正好促使我们运用马克思主义的理论武器，把它们一一驳倒。这是对右派的斗争，同时又是我们自己的人的大练兵。把这场斗争打胜，我国的社会主义建设就会进行得更加顺利。（摘自1957年“学习”半月刊第16期王孝风：“全民大辩论”）
    没有党性就无所谓群众性
    右派分子是把群众性与党性对立起来，企图使人相信有了党，报纸就办不好。其实，我们从来认为报纸的党性与群众性是一致的，报纸的党性是群众性的集中表现。人民群众的利益即是党的利益，除开人民群众的利益，党没有任何私利。党的路线，党的方针政策就是根据群众最大多数的要求与愿望制订的，是群众利益的集中表现。没有党性就无所谓群众性。报纸有了明确的党性立场，才能正确地反映人民性和表达人民性。右派分子离开了党性大谈其群众性，实际上就是以群众性之名，推销其资产阶级的私货。（摘自8月17日浙江日报，景才：“必须分清新闻事业的大是大非”）
    雷海宗要我们“补”的是什么“课”？
    雷海宗说：“中国的社会科学没有资本主义的阶段，因为中国历史上没有经历资本主义，解放前虽向外国学了一点，很少，只是点缀性质，也没学透彻，在中国人的社会意识里没有这个东西。……今天要求我们继承过去人类的文化遗产，并在这个基础上来发展新的社会科学，不研究这些就不行。”按照这些荒谬的说法，似乎不经过资本主义的阶段，任何一个国家也不可能发展自己的科学，必须去乞怜资本主义。在他看来，社会主义阵营的文化似乎贫乏得毫无可取。这不是明白地要我们对马克思主义、对中国丰富的文化遗产、对飞跃发展的社会主义科学文化丧失一切信心，要我们这些“没有经历资本主义阶段”的中国人民彻底向资产阶级社会科学投降，让资产阶级社会科学在中国复辟，甚至使中国社会“补上”资本主义这一阶段吗？（摘自8月18日天津日报吴廷璆：“揭穿雷海宗反党、反马克思主义的阴谋”）
