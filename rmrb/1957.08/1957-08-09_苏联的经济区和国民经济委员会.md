To the Reader:

    Reader's letter asks: The Soviet Union now leads industry and construction through the National Economic Committees of the economic zones. What are economic zones, and how are they divided?
    Answer: Since July 1 this year, the Soviet Union has implemented a new management system for industry and construction. The previous method of leadership by the central government through specialized ministries (such as the Ministry of Machine Building, the Ministry of Coal Industry, the Ministry of Iron and Steel Industry, etc.) has been abolished. The focus of leadership has been decentralized to the local level, adopting the principle of regional leadership. Based on this principle, one hundred and five economic administrative regions have been established throughout the country, and National Economic Committees have been established within the economic administrative regions to manage industry and construction.
    Economic administrative regions are divided based on administrative units such as states, border regions, or republics, while also taking into account their level of industrial development and regional conditions. Many industrially developed states or autonomous republics, such as Sverdlovsk Oblast and the Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, are each an economic administrative region. Some less industrially developed states are grouped together to form an economic administrative region. However, some regions, such as the Yakut Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, although not very industrially developed, are located in remote areas and require local management agencies, so they are also designated as an economic administrative region. Thus, the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic has established a total of seventy economic zones, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic eleven, the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic four, the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic nine, and the remaining eleven republics each have one economic zone, for a total of one hundred and five.
    The National Economic Committee in each economic administrative region uniformly manages industry and construction. The National Economic Committee is led by the Council of Ministers of the Union Republic, and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union leads them through the Council of Ministers of the Union Republic.
    This is the situation of the economic administrative regions. Now people usually refer to economic administrative regions as economic zones for short. (Jun)

    苏联的经济区和国民经济委员会
    读者来信问：苏联现在通过经济区的国民经济委员会来领导工业和建设，请问什么叫做经济区，是怎样划分的？
    答：苏联自今年7月1日起，对工业和建设实行了新的管理制度。取消了过去由中央通过专业部（如机器制造部、采煤工业部、钢铁工业部等）来领导的办法，把领导重心下放到地方，采取按地区领导的原则。根据这个原则在全国成立了一百零五个经济行政区，在经济行政区内成立国民经济委员会，由它来管理工业和建设。
    经济行政区是以州、边疆区或共和国等行政单位而划分的，同时考虑到它们的工业发展水平和地区条件。许多工业发达的州或自治共和国，如斯维德洛夫斯克州、巴什基尔自治共和国等都各是一个经济行政区。一些工业不够发达的州，则几个州是一个经济行政区。但是有的地区，如雅库特自治共和国，虽然工业不很发达，但因它处在边远地区，也需要在当地设立管理机关，因而也划为一个经济行政区。这样，俄罗斯联邦共和国共建立了七十个经济区，乌克兰共和国十一个，乌兹别克四个，哈萨克九个，其余十一个共和国各为一个经济区，共一百零五个。
    每一个经济行政区内的国民经济委员会，统一管理工业和建设。国民经济委员会受加盟共和国部长会议领导，苏联部长会议则通过加盟共和国部长会议来领导它们。
    这就是经济行政区的情况。现在人们通常已把经济行政区简称为经济区了。　（君）
