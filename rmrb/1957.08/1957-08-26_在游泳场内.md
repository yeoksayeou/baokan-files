　　Inside the Swimming Pool
　　By Our Reporter
    The most anticipated event by the audience in the various competitions on the 25th was the men's adult Group A 100-meter breaststroke preliminary round. Because sports champions Qi Lieyun, Mu Xiangxiong, and others were participating in the second group of this competition, people estimated that a gathering of heroes would lead to a heated competition and excellent results. But strangely enough, the result of the competition was that Qi Lieyun only won second place with a time of one minute and nineteen and nine-tenths seconds. This is eight and three-tenths seconds slower than the world record of one minute and eleven and six-tenths seconds he set in May of this year. Mu Xiangxiong's score was also only one minute and twenty-one and two-tenths seconds.
    Who took first place? It turned out that Guangdong athlete Li Chiyun beat the champions with a time of one minute and eighteen and two-tenths seconds.
    Why did the champions fall behind?
    It is reported that the reason why the results were not ideal is that these seasoned veterans are not quick to expend their physical strength. They know when they should fully exert their strength and skill. So, in the 100-meter breaststroke final on the 26th, there will definitely be satisfactory results.

    Shanghai team female swimmer Dai Lihua won two gold medals on the first day of the competition. In the 400-meter individual medley, Dai Lihua easily took first place with her all-around physique and skillful technique. When she reached the finish line, her four opponents were still twenty or thirty meters behind her. But when she won first place in the 100-meter freestyle, it was not so easy. Near the finish line, Dai Lihua was still in second place behind People's Liberation Army athlete Chen Huiying, but three meters from the finish line, Dai rushed forward and snatched the gold medal. If Chen Huiying had more competition experience, Dai Lihua, the national record holder in this event, would likely have been in second place.

    Guangzhou team's junior athlete Lu Xixia won first place in the fourth group of the men's junior 100-meter freestyle preliminary round with a time of one minute and two and three-tenths seconds, which was also the best result in the six groups of this competition. This result not only exceeded the best result of one minute and four seconds in the men's adult Group B 100-meter freestyle competition, but also exceeded the first-class athlete standard of one minute and four seconds. Several other junior athletes also achieved the second-class athlete standard. This competition alone shows how quickly our new generation of sports is growing!

    The women's Group A springboard diving competition attracted a lot of spectators. When the athletes performed various side, twisting, and tumbling movements such as swallow skimming the water, hawk turning over, and meteor chasing the moon on the three-meter-high springboard, they won warm applause from the audience. Guangdong athlete Kuang Yaomei, who had only recently learned to dive, won first place (97.15 points) with her graceful posture and greater difficulty in the five compulsory and five optional movements, twenty points more than Chen Jieyun of the People's Liberation Army, who came in second.
    Guangdong diving athlete Liang Xiuying, who was considered promising by experts, did not participate in the competition this time due to otitis.

    Yesterday, although it was drizzling, the stands of Taoranting Swimming Pool, which can accommodate 6,000 people, were still full of spectators. There were still many people waiting for returned tickets at the ticket office outside. In the stands, the audience watched the game in the rain, holding umbrellas of various colors and wearing large straw hats of various colors. When the athletes competed fiercely with each other near the finish line, the excited audience also waved their large straw hats to cheer for the athletes.

    25日的各项比赛中最为观众瞩目的一项就是男子成人甲组百公尺蛙泳预赛，因为在这一比赛的第二组中，有运动健将戚烈云、穆祥雄等人参加，人们估计，群英聚会，定有一番热烈的争夺场面，也会出现良好成绩。可是真奇怪，比赛结果，戚烈云只以一分十九秒九获第二名。这同他在今年5月创造一分十一秒六的世界新成绩相差八秒三。穆祥雄的成绩也只有一分二十一秒二。
    第一名被谁夺去了呢？原来广东运动员李炽云以一分十八秒二抢在健将们的前面。
    为什么健将们落在后面了呢？
    据悉，所以成绩不够理想，是因为这些久惯沙场上的战将们，不轻易耗费体力，他们深知在什么时机才应该把力量和技术全部发挥出来。那么在26日的百公尺蛙泳决赛中，定会出现令人满意的成绩了。

    上海队女游泳运动员戴丽华在第一天的比赛中就获得了两枚金质奖章。戴丽华在四百公尺个人混合式比赛中，以她的全面发展的体格和熟练的技术，从容地取得了第一名。到达终点时，她的四位对手还在距离她二、三十公尺的后面呢。但是她在取得一百公尺自由泳第一名时，就不是那么容易了。快到终点时戴丽华还在解放军运动员陈慧英的后面居第二，但是距终点三公尺戴一冲而上夺走了金质奖章。如果陈慧英具有丰富的比赛经验的话，这个项目的全国最高纪录保持者戴丽华，很可能名列第二了。

    广州队少年组运动员卢细虾，在男子少年组一百公尺自由泳预赛中以一分二秒三的成绩获得了第四组的第一名，也是这项比赛六个组中成绩最好的一个。这个成绩，不但超过男子成人乙组百公尺自由泳比赛的最好成绩一分四秒，而且已超过一级运动员一分四秒的规定标准。还有几个少年运动员的成绩也都达到了二级运动员的标准。就从这一项比赛可以看出，我们体育方面的新生的一代正在以多么快的速度生长着啊！

    女子甲组跳板跳水的比赛吸引了不少的观众。当运动员在三公尺高的跳板上表演了飞燕掠水、鹞子翻身、流星赶月等各种各样的侧身、转体、滚翻等动作时，博得了观众热烈的掌声。不久以前才学跳水的广东省运动员邝耀眉，在五项规定动作和五项自选动作中，以姿势优美、难度较大而获得了第一名（九十七点十五分），比第二名解放军的陈洁云要多二十分。
    被专家们认为较有希望的广东省跳水运动员梁秀英，这次因患耳炎没有参加比赛。

    昨日虽然细雨蒙蒙，但是陶然亭游泳场能容纳六千人的看台上还是坐满了观众。外面售票处还有不少等退票的人。在看台上，观众撑着各种颜色的雨伞、戴着各色的大草帽冒雨观看了这场比赛。当运动员在快到终点互相激烈竞争时，兴奋的观众还挥舞着大草帽为运动员们加油、助威。
