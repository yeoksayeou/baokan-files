Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Ministry of Culture and the Chinese Writers Association held a national film script solicitation in March of last year, originally scheduled to award prizes at the end of July this year. Due to the relevant departments being intensely engaged in the anti-Rightist struggle, the awarding work has been decided to be postponed.

    There were a total of 2,609 film scripts submitted for this solicitation. After careful selection by the editorial departments of Shanghai Film Studio and Beijing and Changchun Film Studios, and a second selection by the Awarding Office, over twenty scripts, including "The Opium War," "Sea Soul," "Shanghai Girl," and "The Fifth Watch," have been recommended to the Awarding Committee, including "On the Distant Pasture" by the Tibetan young woman Yuexi Zhuoma and "Gada Meilin" by the Mongolian youth Menghe Boyan. Some have already begun filming.

    Since the vast majority of submissions come from amateur creators from different professions such as government cadres, workers, farmers, and military officers, the themes are extremely rich and broad. Among the more than twenty outstanding scripts that have been recommended, only a few are written by professional film screenwriters, the others being the work of young writers and amateur authors.

    电影剧本征文
    延期进行评奖
    据新华社讯　文化部和中国作家协会在去年3月间举办全国电影文学剧本征文，原定在今年7月底评奖。由于有关部门正在紧张进行反右派斗争，评奖工作决定延期进行。
    这次应征的电影文学剧本共有二千六百零九个。经过上海电影制片公司，北京、长春二个电影制片厂的编辑处的郑重挑选，再经过评奖办公室复选，已向评奖委员会推选出“鸦片战争”、“海魂”、“上海姑娘”、“五更寒”等二十多个剧本，其中有藏族女青年悦希卓玛的“在遥远的牧场上”和蒙族青年孟和博彦的“嘎达梅林”。有些已在开始拍摄。
    由于应征作品绝大部分出自机关干部、工人、农民、军官等不同职业的业余创作者之手，题材极其丰富、广泛。已被推荐的二十多个优秀剧本之中，只有少数剧本是专业电影编剧写的，其他都是青年作家同业余作者的作品。
