Xu Mengxiong is a Counter-Revolutionary Poisonous Bee

This newspaper reports that Professor Xu Mengxiong, who once slandered Renmin University of China as a "dogmatic beehive," is a right-wing vanguard against the Communist Party and socialism. Faculty, students, and staff at Renmin University have exposed and criticized him.

Xu Mengxiong aimed to overthrow Marxism-Leninism by smearing Renmin University of China. He said, "Renmin University is a dogmatic beehive. Students are poison-spreading wasps, unable to collect honey when they fly out, only able to sting and spread poison." He particularly attacked the four political theory courses, saying, "The school seems to practice primogeniture, valuing the four political theory courses too much, showing them double favor. Family prosperity depends on the eldest son, and family failure also depends on the eldest son; all problems are decided by this eldest son." He directly proposed the abolition of Marxism-Leninism, saying things like "Those who teach English don't need Marxism-Leninism," and as early as in his English class for the International Journalism program of the Journalism Department, he claimed to implement an "English dictatorship," using "dictatorship" methods to forcibly deprive students of time to study other political theory courses, not allowing students to participate in the just demonstrations against the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt, and even interfering with Party and Youth League members' organizational activities.

Following the "beehive" poisoned arrow, Xu Mengxiong concentrated his fire on the Party, Party members, and Party policies, unleashing a barrage of attacks. He denigrated the Five Great Movements and the Three Great Transformations led by the Party. He also slandered our Party as incompetent, saying: everywhere you see the likes of Liao Hua acting as pioneers, he "suggested": a major inspection of the "competent" and the "incompetent" should be carried out. Those who are "competent" should please return to the team, and those who are "incompetent" should go to study. Based on the above malicious distortions of the Party's leadership, he demanded that "Party members dismount," he said: "I only like dynastic changes, so I have no good feelings about the current revolution." He hoped to pull the wheels of history backward.

In order to overthrow the leadership of the Party, Xu Mengxiong boasted that he was the number one figure in the Chinese English world, claiming to "gather all the English teachers in the country and let me train them." However, the manuscript of his translation of "The Hurricane" was revised almost every line.

At the same time, Xu Mengxiong also denounced our country's "leaning to one side" foreign policy, provoked China-Soviet disunity, and opposed learning from the Soviet Union.

Xu Mengxiong put forward his bourgeois reactionary "theory of human nature." He said, "The Communist Party is inhumane, how can it govern people? I hope the leadership will first understand human nature, and then talk about Party spirit."

Xu came from a bureaucratic family and aspired to be an official from an early age. He studied politics in university and later became a professor at the puppet Central Political University. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, he climbed into the Kuomintang again, threw himself under the wing of Luo Jialun, one of the reactionary leaders of the CC clique, and was appointed as the Consul-General of the Kuomintang reactionary government in Malaya, and later promoted to First Secretary of the Embassy in India. He was deeply appreciated by his British imperialist masters, helping the evildoers and persecuting overseas Chinese.

    许孟雄是一只反共毒蜂
    本报讯　曾经污蔑中国人民大学为“教条主义大蜂窝”的教授许孟雄是个反共反社会主义的右派急先锋。人民大学师生员工对他进行了揭露和批判。
    许孟雄通过对中国人民大学的污蔑要达到推翻马克思列宁主义的目的。他说：“人民大学是教条主义大蜂窝。学生是散毒的黄蜂，飞出去不能采蜜，只能刺人散毒。”他特别攻击四门政治理论课说：“学校似乎实行长子主义，对四门政治理论课太重视，双倍宠爱。家兴是长子，家败也是长子，一切问题都决定于这个长子”。他直接提出取消马列主义的论调，说什么“教英文的用不着马列主义”等等，并且早就在他担负的新闻系国际新闻班的英文课堂上声称要“英文专政”，用“专政”的办法强硬剥夺了同学们学习其他政治理论课的时间，不许学生参加抗议英法侵略埃及的正义游行，甚至连党、团员过组织生活他都要干涉。
    许孟雄紧接着“大蜂窝”那支毒箭之后，更集中火力对党、党员、党的政策放出了连珠炮弹。他诋毁党所领导的五大运动、三大改造。他还诋毁我们党无能，说：到处都看见廖化者流在当先锋，他“建议”：来一个“有能”与“无能”的大检查。“有能”的人请归队，“无能”的人去学习。根据以上对党的领导的恶意歪曲，他要求“党员下马”，他说：“我只喜欢改朝换代，因而对现在的革命没有好感。”他希望把历史的车轮拉回去。
    许孟雄为了推翻党的领导，自我吹嘘是中国英文界的第一把交椅，声称要“把全国的英文教员集中起来，让我来训练”。可是，他翻译的“暴风骤雨”的底稿几乎每一行都经过修改。
    同时，许孟雄又谩骂我国“一边倒”的外交政策，挑拨中苏团结，反对学习苏联。
    许孟雄提出了他的资产阶级的反动的“人性论”。他说：“共产党不近人情，怎能治人？我希望领导上先懂得人性，再来谈党性。”
    许出身于官僚家庭，从小就立志当官，大学时学的是政治，后来在伪中央政治大学当上教授。抗战胜利后，他又爬入国民党，投靠CC派反动头子之一罗家伦，被委派为国民党反动政府驻马来亚总领事，后又升任驻印度大使馆一等秘书，深得英帝国主义主子赏识，助纣为虐，迫害侨民。
