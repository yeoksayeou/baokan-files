    On June 6th, in the corridor of the Henan Provincial Tax Bureau building, a very conspicuous notice written on yellow paper suddenly appeared. It read: "In order to help the Party's rectification campaign and develop the big-character poster activity, if there are comrades who can tell the facts but cannot write, and wish to post their opinions, please find Dong Faxiang, Zhang Bingqian, and Liu Wenjun to write it for you." Signed below: "Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK) Branch." Before the paste on the notice had even dried, these three people who volunteered to serve as "writing service" personnel hurriedly and surreptitiously went to many dormitories and offices to solicit "writing" business. Within two days, they "wrote" and fabricated more than a hundred big-character posters, covering both sides of the Tax Bureau building corridor so densely that the plastered walls could not be seen. These big-character posters slandered and attacked all the bureau directors and section chiefs in the bureau.

    According to revealed materials, at that time, all the big-character posters in the Tax Bureau were monopolized by this "writing service." Many of the fallacies in the big-character posters written by the "writing service" were their own. They even wrote the big-character posters and then "mobilized" others to sign them; other big-character posters "written" for others often distorted the original opinions of the people, or added fuel to the fire and infiltrated their own reactionary opinions, or marked them with conspicuous and inflammatory headlines. The slanderous and inflammatory big-character posters that appeared at that time, threatening the Party to immediately organize a "salary evaluation and grade adjustment review committee," "appealing! To pull down incompetent people!" and scolding Communist Party members as "bureaucrats who only eat and do nothing, receiving high salaries," were all their own opinions. Chu Anping's fallacy of "the Party's world" was also spread among the masses through their "writing service." A cadre named Shen Jinsheng explained to the "writing service" that he had some opinions on the grading and leadership style, but after being tampered with by the "writing service," his opinions were turned into the Communist Party's eight major "crimes," which were: "Remuneration according to work – more work, less pay; less work, more pay; leadership principles – officials protect each other, detached from the masses; leadership methods – reporting at all levels, suppressing criticism; organizational concept – you say, I listen, obey; cadre policy – promote party members, use the masses," and so on.

    After posting so many big-character posters, the "commander" of the three "writing service" personnel, rightist Dong Faxiang, felt elated that this "had stabbed a knife into the heart of the Communist Party." He even became so arrogant that he ordered his "writing service" to move to the office of Section 1 to officially work, despite the opposition of the comrades in Section 1 of the Tax Bureau.

    After the start of the Party's rectification movement, Dong Faxiang, in his capacity as the chairman of the RCCK branch of the Tax Bureau, organized three discussion meetings in a row, and said to the Party organization in the bureau: "Don't send people to participate. If there are party members, it will affect the airing of views." In addition to the members of the RCCK, he invited all those who were targets of the "Three-Anti" and "Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries" movements and those who were dissatisfied with the Party to participate in the discussion meetings. He said at the discussion meetings: "Party members have Party organizations, Youth League members have Youth League organizations, you have no organization, the RCCK will manage you, and you will contact the RCCK in the future." In those days, he spent all day talking to those he considered targets, "organizing" materials to "accuse" the Party until the middle of the night.

    The "writing service" headed by Dong Faxiang also fabricated many inflammatory "proposals" and launched others to sign them. At this time, Dong Faxiang felt that the "time" was almost ripe, and said triumphantly: "The prestige of the RCCK has increased unprecedentedly, while the prestige of the Communist Party has plummeted." He frantically further threatened the Party: "Reorganize the Party's rectification leadership group in the agency and absorb RCCK members to participate; establish a joint meeting system of the CPC, Youth League, and RCCK branches to make decisions on major issues affecting the overall situation." This ambitious anti-communist element simply believed that the Tax Bureau was about to become Dong Faxiang's world. After the start of the anti-rightist struggle, his true colors were exposed by the masses.

    According to Dong Faxiang's own preliminary confession, his anti-communist words and deeds during the airing of views were directed by Li Jingzhi, a member of the RCCK Henan Provincial Committee and a rightist ringleader. His "writing service" was deeply appreciated by Li, and Li also instructed the grassroots organizations of the RCCK in Zhengzhou to vigorously promote it. Many people revealed that Dong Faxiang usually disguised himself as an "activist" in order to win the trust of the Party and everyone, so that he could climb higher and carry out anti-communist activities more conveniently. His confidant Zhang Bingqian said: Dong Faxiang himself also admitted that he was prepared to continue pretending to be active, because he was having a pipe dream: striving to become the chairman of the Luoyang RCCK Committee (Luoyang currently does not have an RCCK organization), and then further seize the position of Deputy Mayor of Luoyang, so that he could carry out anti-communist activities.

    For this insidious and vicious anti-communist element, it is regrettable that when his claws were just stretched out, they were cut off by the masses standing on the front line of the anti-rightist struggle.

    一个别有用心的“代书处”
    新华社记者　陈健
    6月6日，在河南省税务局大楼的走廊里，突然出现了一张极其醒目的用黄纸写的布告，上面写着：“为了帮助党整风，开展大字报活动，如有能说事实，但不能写的同志，愿将你们的意见贴出来，可找董发祥、张炳钱、刘文俊代写”。下边签署“民革支部”。张贴这张布告的浆糊还未干，这三位自愿担任“代书”工作的人，便急急忙忙、鬼鬼祟祟地分别在很多宿舍和办公室里活动“代书”了。两天内，他们“代书”和自编了一百多张大字报，把税务局大楼走廊两边贴得密密层层，看不见粉墙。这些大字报谩骂和攻击了局里所有的局长和科长。
    据揭露出来的材料，当时税务局的大字报全部被这个“代书处”所垄断。“代书处”所写的大字报中，有很多是他们自己的谬论，他们甚至写成大字报后，再“动员”别人签名；其他替人“代书”的大字报，也往往歪曲了本人原来的意见，或者添油加醋地渗入他们自己的反动意见，或者标上显目的带有煽动性的标题。当时出现的威胁党马上组织“评薪调级复查委员会”，“呼吁！把不称职的人拉下来！”骂共产党员都是些“只吃不做，领取高薪的官僚”等等诬蔑和煽动性的大字报，都是他们自己的意见。储安平的
  “党天下”谬论，也通过他们“代书”，在群众中散布开来。一位叫沈进生的干部，向“代书处”说明自己对评级和领导作风有些意见，可是经“代书处”篡改，把他的意见变成了共产党的八大“罪行”，这就是：“按劳取酬——大劳少得，少劳多得；领导原则——官官相护，脱离群众；领导方法——层层汇报，压制批评；组织观念——你说我听，俯首顺从；干部政策——提拔党员，使用群众”等等。
    在贴出了这许多大字报以后，三位代书者的“主将”、右派分子董发祥，认为这“给共产党的心脏插上了把刀”而得意洋洋起来。他甚至狂妄到不顾税务局一科同志的反对，命令他的“代书处”搬到一科办公室正式办公。
    董发祥在党的整风运动开始后，以税务局民革支部主任委员的身份，一连组织了三次座谈会，并向局里的党组织说：“你们不要派人参加，有党员，影响鸣放”。除了民革的成员以外，他邀了局里所有“三反”和“肃反”运动的对象以及对党不满的人参加座谈会。他在座谈会上说：“党员有党组织，团员有团组织，你们没有组织，民革管你们，以后你和民革联系。”在那些日子里，他整天找那些他认为的对象谈话，成半夜地“整理”向党“控告”的材料。
    以董发祥为首的“代书处”，还制造出来很多带煽动性的“建议书”，发动别人签名。这时，董发祥觉得“时机”差不多了，便得意忘形地说：“民革的威信空前提高，共产党的威信却一落千丈”。他疯狂地进一步威胁党：“改组机关内党的整风领导小组，吸收民革成员参加；建立中共、团和民革三方面的支委联席会议制度，决策全局重大问题”。这个野心勃勃的反共分子，简直认为税务局的天下快要成为他董发祥的了。在反右派斗争开始后，他的原形就被群众揭穿了。
    据董发祥自己初步交代，他在鸣放中的反共言行，是由民革河南省委委员、右派头子李静之指挥的，他的“代书处”深得李的赞赏，李还指示郑州市民革各基层组织，大力推广它。不少人揭发，董发祥平时把自己装扮成一个“积极分子”，是为了骗取党和大家的信任，好爬的更高，进行反共活动更加方便。他的心腹张炳钱说：董发祥自己也承认还准备再假积极下去，因为他正在做一场美梦：争取当洛阳市民革委员会主任委员（洛阳现在还没有民革组织），然后进一步窃取洛阳市副市长的职位，以便他进行反共活动。
    对这个阴险毒辣的反共分子说来，遗憾的是，当他的魔爪刚刚伸出的时候，就被站在反右派斗争战线上的群众斩断了。
