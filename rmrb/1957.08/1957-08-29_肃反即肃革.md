　　“Rectification is Rectifying Revolution”
　　What is the most intelligent thing in the world? A stupid donkey. What is the most refined thing in the world? A wild boar. What is the most upright thing in the world? "Crescent Moon", CC. What is the most "revolutionary" thing in the world? Sun Dayu! Do you know that Dayu Sun's "revolution" started twenty-seven years ago, from participating in the reactionary "Crescent Moon" to colluding with the secret agent CC, and personally presenting Luo Longji's traitorous plan to Ambassador Wedemeyer? But Dayu Sun's "revolutionary" "achievements" are the highest after liberation, always painstakingly scolding "the Communist Party cannot lead," especially scolding "rectification is rectifying revolution" as "a complete mess." Since Dayu Sun's "revolution" is some kind of secret agent CC... the Communist Party's rectification is of course a heinous crime! Since Dayu Sun's "revolution" is a secret agent CC, he of course wants to eliminate the Communist Party and progressive people. Since Dayu Sun convicts and eliminates the Communist Party, the people's democratic dictatorship will of course collapse, and Zhang, Luo, and Sun will of course sit in the court! Don't say that a Shakespeare "expert" who only translated one book has no ability; in one night's meeting, he came up with more than sixty "counter-revolutionary" names... But, oh no! The real victim accuses! Comrade Zao Shi, take a look at which article of capitalist law is good; thank you, brother Zizhan, for your head nodding assurance; I am, indeed, "sick" and weak: only "can swim" and race.

　　“肃反即肃革”
　　俯拾世界上什么最聪明？蠢驴，世界上什么最文雅？野猪，世界上什么最笔直？“新月”、CC，世界上什么最“革命”？孙大雨！你可知道大雨孙“革命”二十七年前就开始，从参加反动的“新月”、到勾通特务CC，并且把罗隆基的卖国计划、亲捧给魏德迈大使，但大雨孙的“革命”“功劳”解放后最高，一直辛辛苦苦的骂“共产党不能领导”，特别骂“肃反即肃革”“搞的一团糟”。既然大雨孙的“革命”是一些特务CC……共产党搞肃反当然罪大恶极！既然大雨孙的“革命”是特务CC，他当然要肃清共产党和进步人士。既然大雨孙把共产党定罪又肃清，人民专政当然垮台，章、罗、孙当然坐朝庭！莫说只译一本书的莎士比亚“专家”没本领，一夜会议开出六十几个“反革命”姓名，……可是糟糕！真苦主控告！造时兄呀！看看资本主义法律那条好，谢谢子展弟一伸一缩的头早担保，我呀，实在“病”的弱不禁风：只“可以游泳”和赛跑。
