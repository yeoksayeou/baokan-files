(Our newspaper's Hefei dispatch, 7th) The "September 3rd Society" Hefei branch rectification group's recent meeting exposed the plot of the branch's rightist elements to carry out anti-Party activities in an organized and planned manner. Six out of the branch's nine preparatory committee members are rightists. These rightist elements are Zhao Lunyi (professor at the Agricultural College), Shen Wenfou (curator of the Agricultural College Library), Qiao Jiaxian (works at the Scientific Research Institute), Zhang Zijing (works at the Scientific Research Institute), Liu Jun (professor at the Mining College), and Gong Jiahu (associate professor at the Mining College). They controlled the branch's leadership and actively arranged rightist followers in various grassroots levels. During the rectification period, they vigorously developed the organization as political capital for anti-Party and anti-socialist activities. Qiao Jiaxian said, "The Communist Party does not develop Party members during the rectification period, which is a good opportunity for us in the September 3rd Society to develop." Qiao Jiaxian, Zhao Lunyi, and Shen Wenfou also refused to inform the Provincial Party Committee's United Front Work Department of the organizational situation. In the early days of the blooming and contending period, these rightist elements often held meetings. They formulated a so-called plan to assist the Chinese Communist Party's rectification work, which was essentially a malicious attack on the Party's leadership, attempting to seize the Party's leadership in schools and scientific research institutions. In addition, Shen Wenfou and Qiao Jiaxian specially invited Wang Hengshou, a rightist element from Shanghai, to Hefei to conduct incendiary activities under the guise of giving lectures.

    九个筹备委员有六个右派分子
    “九三”合肥分社被右派操纵
    本报合肥7日电　九三学社合肥分社整风小组最近的会议，揭发了分社的右派分子有组织有计划地进行反党活动的阴谋。分社九个筹备委员中就有六个右派分子。这些右派分子是赵伦伊（农学院教授）、沈文辅（农学院图书馆馆长）、乔家贤（科学研究所工作）、张子敬（科学研究所工作）、刘钧（矿业学院教授）、龚家虎（矿业学院副教授）。他们把持分社领导权，积极在各个基层安排右派党羽。在整风期间，他们大肆发展组织作为反党、反社会主义的政治资本。乔家贤说“共产党在整风期间不发展党员，这是我们九三发展的好机会。”乔家贤、赵伦伊、沈文辅并拒绝将组织情况告知省委统战部。鸣放初期，这些右派分子经常开会，他们制定了所谓协助中国共产党整风工作计划，这个计划实质上是恶毒地攻击党的领导，企图夺取党在学校和科学研究机构内的领导权。此外沈文辅和乔家贤还特地邀请上海右派分子王恒守来合肥借讲学名义进行放火活动。
