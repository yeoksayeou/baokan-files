    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 13th: Encouraged by the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet's adoption of more reactionary policies, the activities of Japanese fascist groups have become even more rampant recently.
    Currently, many militaristic fascist organizations are blatantly launching a so-called "summer offensive" in various places, aimed at opposing communism and the Soviet Union, resisting the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), and advocating rearmament and revision of the Constitution. The "Greater Japan Independence Youth Party" held a speech meeting in Tokyo on August 8, openly clamoring to overthrow the National Railway Workers' Union, one of Japan's most militant labor unions. Shoji Kageyama, the head of "Daito Juku," has been giving speeches in the Tohoku region and Hokkaido since July 28, with the main content being anti-communism and rearmament. Ryoshi Oyama, the leader of another fascist group, the "Asia Friends Association," began a so-called "national salvation tour speech" in various places on July 15, which will last for forty-five days.
    Other fascist organizations such as the "Greater Japan Production Party" and the "Japan Constitution Establishment Association" are planning to carry out various activities during the "Surrender Month" starting from August 15. Kyodo News Agency said that the activities of fascist groups will reach a climax on August 15.

    在岸信介内阁政策鼓舞下
    日本法西斯细菌日益猖獗
    新华社13日讯　东京消息：在岸信介内阁的采取更加反动政策的鼓舞下，日本法西斯团体的活动最近更加猖獗起来。
    目前，很多军国主义法西斯组织正在各地明目张胆地发动反共、反苏、抵制日本工会总评议会和鼓吹重新武装与修改宪法的所谓“夏季攻势”。“大日本独立青年党”曾经在8月8日在东京举行演说会，公然叫嚣要打倒日本战斗性最强的工会之一的国营铁道工会。“大东塾”的头目影山正治已经从7月28日起在日本东北地方和北海道发表了以反共和重新武装为主要内容的演说。另一个法西斯团体“亚洲友之会”的首脑大山量士已经从7月15日开始在各地举行为期四十五天的所谓“救国旅行演说”。
    “大日本生产党”和“日本制宪会”等其他法西斯分子组织正计划在从8月15日开始的“投降月”中进行各种活动。共同社说，法西斯团体的活动将在8月15日达到高潮。
