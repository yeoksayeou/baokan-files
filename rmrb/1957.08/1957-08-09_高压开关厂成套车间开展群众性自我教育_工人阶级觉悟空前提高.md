Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 8th. During the rectification campaign of the Chinese Communist Party, the complete equipment workshop of the Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory launched a mass self-education campaign to rectify labor discipline. The class consciousness and production enthusiasm of the workers have been unprecedentedly enhanced. The labor productivity in July increased by 4.9% compared to June.

Of the 329 workers in the complete equipment workshop, 212 are young workers under the age of 25, and they have had a short time to receive class training. When bourgeois right-wing elements, under the pretext of helping the Communist Party with rectification, launched a vicious attack on the Party and socialism, a few young workers became ideologically confused and labor discipline was lax.

At this time, the veteran worker, Tong Xinhe, introduced his experiences of more than ten years of suffering under the puppet Manchurian regime, giving all the workers in the workshop a vivid lesson. After recalling the equally tragic experiences they had suffered in the old society, the veteran workers unanimously demanded that the workshop leadership rectify labor discipline and eliminate non-working-class thoughts and behaviors.

The Chinese Communist Party branch of the complete equipment workshop accepted the opinions of the veteran workers and decided to launch a mass self-education campaign among the workers to enhance their class consciousness and strengthen the combat effectiveness of the working class, with criticism and self-criticism carried out in groups. Through self-education, the class consciousness of all the workers in the workshop has been unprecedentedly enhanced, and a new atmosphere has emerged in production. Miller Luo Fenglian used to only be able to process 40 large brackets per shift, but in July this increased to 80. Miller Nie Yongji increased his processing of hooks from 50 to 250 per shift. All the workers in the youth section took the initiative to revise the work quota, reducing the working hours for processing explosion-proof switches from 76 hours to 53 hours.

    高压开关厂成套车间开展群众性自我教育
    工人阶级觉悟空前提高
    新华社沈阳8日电　沈阳高压开关厂成套车间在中国共产党整风期间，开展群众性自我教育，整顿劳动纪律，工人的阶级觉悟和生产积极性空前提高，7月份劳动生产率比6月份提高4.9％。
    成套车间的三百二十九名工人中，二十五岁以下的青工就有二百十二名，他们受到的阶级锻炼的时间短。当资产阶级右派分子借口帮助共产党整风，大举向党和社会主义恶毒地进攻的时候，少数青工思想混乱，劳动纪律松懈。
    这时，老工人佟新和介绍了他在伪满遭受的十多年苦难的经历，给全车间工人上了生动的一课。老工人们回忆起在旧社会里受到同样悲惨的遭遇以后，一致要求车间领导方面要整顿劳动纪律，清除非工人阶级思想和行为。
    成套车间中共党支部，接受老工人们的意见，决定在工人中开展群众性自我教育，来提高工人的阶级觉悟，增强工人阶级的战斗力，以小组为单位开展批评和自我批评。全车间工人通过自我教育，阶级觉悟空前提高，在生产上出现新的气象。铣工洛凤连，过去加工大支架，每班只能干四十个，7月份提高到八十个。铣工聂永吉加工钩子，每班从五十个提高到二百五十个。青年工段全体工人，主动要求修改工时定额，把加工防爆开关的工时，从七十六小时压缩到五十三小时。
