Here we introduce a "Young Guard" that defends the Party and the socialist cause. Its members are six students from the Chinese Department of Shenyang Normal College – Communist Youth League members Zhang Hao (female), Chen Yulin (female), Zhang Shuxian (female), Cheng Zhuangbao (female), Suo Baogang, and youth Tang Linan.

The "Young Guard" was one of the earliest progressive groups to emerge among the dozens of such groups at the Normal College dedicated to counterattacking the Rightists.

June 12th was the day the Rightists were most rampant at the Normal College. Rightists Zhang Baisheng and Huang Zhenlü incited some students with right-leaning sentiments to protest at the *Liaoning Daily* against the publication of articles criticizing their fallacies. This was met with criticism and dissuasion by progressive students. Lecturer Li Chenglie gave a speech to the masses, advising students not to be fooled by the Rightists. The next day, the Rightists posted a big-character poster, launching a personal attack on Li Chenglie. Right next to this reactionary big-character poster, another big-character poster shone with red light, writing: "Support Teacher Li Chenglie's speech defending socialism!" "We resolutely oppose revisionist fallacies, and we will never be tempted!" Below was signed "The Young Guard."

The "Young Guard" stung the Rightists, who called it a "blacklisted group." But they continued to fight! The Rightists posted a big-character poster calling for a strike against the History of the Chinese Revolution course. The "Young Guard" immediately posted a big-character poster next to it: "Oppose using opposition to dogmatism to oppose Marxism-Leninism!" The Rightists posted a big-character poster supporting Zhang and Huang's fallacies. They immediately posted a big-character poster next to it: "If you firmly believe in Zhang and Huang's fallacies, you will lose your political direction for advancement!" In this way, they carried out an uncompromising struggle against the Rightists.

After the anti-Rightist struggle deepened, they also published nearly ten issues of wall posters under the name "Torch," powerfully exposing and criticizing the fallacies of the Rightists.

Worthy of being called the "Young Guard"! When the Party was under a wild attack by the Rightists, they stepped forward and defended the cause of the Party with their loyalty! (Attached pictures)

### 捍卫党的“青年近卫军”

    捍卫党的“青年近卫军”
    这里介绍的是一支捍卫党和社会主义事业的“青年近卫军”。它的成员是沈阳师范学院中文系的六名学生——共青团员张昊（女）、陈玉琳（女）、张淑贤（女）、程庄葆（女）、索宝刚和青年唐林楠。
    “青年近卫军”是师范学院反击右派的几十个进步社团中最早出现的一个。
    6月12日，是右派分子在师范学院活动最猖狂的一天。右派分子张百生、黄振旅煽动一部分有右倾情绪的学生，去辽宁日报抗议登载批驳他们谬论的文章，受到进步学生的批评和劝阻，李承烈讲师向群众讲演，劝告同学不要上右派分子的当。第二天，右派分子就贴出了大字报，对李承烈进行人身攻击。就在这张反动的大字报旁边，一张大字报闪耀着红色的光芒，上面写着：“支持李承烈老师捍卫社会主义的言论！”“我们坚决反对修正主义的谬论，我们决不受诱惑！”下面署着“青年近卫军”。
    “青年近卫军”刺痛了右派分子，右派分子把它称之为“黑名社”。可是他们继续战斗！右派分子贴出一张罢考中国革命史的大字报，“青年近卫军”马上就在旁边贴上大字报：“反对以反对教条主义反对马列主义！”右派分子贴出支持张、黄谬论的大字报，他们马上就在旁边贴上大字报：“你要坚信张、黄的谬论，就会失去前进的政治方向！”就这样，他们和右派分子针锋相对地进行不调和的斗争。
    反右派斗争深入展开之后，他们又以“火炬”为名，出了近十期墙报，有力地揭露和批驳了右派分子的谬论。
    无愧是“青年近卫军”！当着党受着右派分子猖狂进攻的时候，他们挺身而出，用自己的忠诚，捍卫着党的事业！（附图片）
