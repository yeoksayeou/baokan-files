Vietnamese students are enjoying their summer vacation. Many students visited famous historical sites and construction sites near their schools; most students from rural areas returned to their hometowns to help with production; and many students learned the lesson of "Labor is Glorious" through visits to factories and rural areas, and participation in flood and typhoon prevention activities.

Responding to the government's call for flood and typhoon prevention, students in various parts of Vietnam have organized youth shock brigades to prepare to fight floods and typhoons at any time. On July 11, the water of the Dongjiang River, a tributary of the Red River, washed away the Meilin Sluice Gate northwest of Hanoi, and the floodwaters inundated a large area west of the Hanoi-Muc Nam Quan Railway. The students remaining in Hanoi's universities immediately mobilized to participate in the project of rushing to block the breach. University students from Hanoi also went to the Meilin construction site with the young people of the streets.

Many students in Hanoi, Ha Dong, Hai Phong and other places visited the suburbs and lived, ate, and worked with farmers. The students helped the farmers hoe the ground, pull weeds, and apply fertilizer. After finishing their work, they also organized ball games, get-togethers, and other activities. The farmers were both happy and moved, and received them like relatives. Some students who had gathered from the South to the North even recognized adoptive fathers and mothers in the villages, and thus had homes in the North.

The Children's Club on the shore of Hoan Kiem Lake has become the center of summer activities for Hanoi's elementary school students. There are swimming pools and various sports and cultural activity facilities, as well as many training classes in swimming, painting, and music, and numerous specialized groups for singing and dancing. Every day, it attracts hundreds of children.

This summer, many university students in Hanoi have been assigned to factories and farms in various places for production internships; in addition, many students have traveled to scenic resorts such as Tam Dao and Tu Son to sightsee and rest. (Hanoi News from Our Newspaper) (Attached Picture)

    越南学生暑假生活
    组织突击队参加防洪斗争和市郊农民同吃住同劳动
    越南学生正在愉快地度暑假。许多学生参观了他们学校附近的名胜古迹和建设工地；家在农村的学生，大都回乡帮助生产；不少学生通过访问工厂、农村，参加防汛、防风等活动，上了“劳动光荣”的一课。
    越南各地学生响应政府防汛、防风的号召，纷纷组织青年突击队，准备随时同洪水和大风搏斗。7月11日，红河支流冬江的河水冲毁了河内西北的梅林水闸，河水漫没了河内一睦南关铁路以西的大片地区。河内各大学留校的学生立刻动员起来，赶去参加抢堵决口的工程。家在河内的大学生，也和街道青年一起上梅林工地去。
    河内、河东、海防等地的许多学生，到市郊访问，和农民同吃、同住、同劳动。学生帮助农民锄地、拔草、上肥料，干完活还组织赛球、联欢等活动。农民又喜欢又感动，像亲人似地接待他们。一些从南方北上集结的学生，还在村里认了干爸、干娘，从此在北方也有了家。
    还剑湖畔的少年俱乐部，成了河内小学生暑期活动的中心。这里有游泳池和各种文体活动的设备，又开办了游泳、绘画、音乐等许多训练班，还有歌咏、舞蹈等名目繁多的专门小组。每天都吸引着成十上百的少年儿童。
    今年暑假，河内有许多大学生被分配到各地的工厂、农场进行生产实习；另外，也有许多学生结伴到三岛涂山等避暑胜地去游览、休息。　（本报河内讯）（附图片）
