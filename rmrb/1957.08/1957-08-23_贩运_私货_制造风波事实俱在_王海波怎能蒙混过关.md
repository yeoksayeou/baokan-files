　　Trafficking in "Private Goods" and Creating Disturbances Are Undeniable Facts
　　How Can Wang Haibo Get Away With It?
    (Reported by this newspaper) The Ministry of Aquatic Products has exposed a hidden, insidious, and cunning rightist backbone element, Wang Haibo.

    Wang Haibo is a staff member of the Research Office of the Ministry of Aquatic Products and the person in charge of the Jiu San Society within the Ministry of Aquatic Products. On the surface, Wang Haibo appears to be a man of few words, but when he opens his mouth, he spews out a plethora of Marxist-Leninist terms. However, as soon as the rectification movement began, his fox tail was exposed.

    On May 3rd, at a meeting organized by the Jiu San Society within the Ministry of Aquatic Products, Wang Haibo declared three "crimes" of the Communist Party against intellectuals: First, the use of intellectuals failed to "make the best use of their talents" and failed to achieve "consistency between learning and application"; second, the excessive number of confidential documents and overly strict restrictions on research materials; and third, "endless entanglement with general historical and social relations issues of intellectuals." He slandered the Party's attitude towards intellectuals as "negating everything" and implementing an endless attitude of exclusion.

    In mid-June, at a rectification meeting held by the Ministry of Aquatic Products, Wang Haibo openly launched a vicious attack on the Party's personnel system. He said that socialism has no system and is terrible everywhere. He attacked the existing leaders for having serious incompetence and advocated that the existing directors, bureau chiefs, section chiefs, and heads of offices who are not "competent" must be demoted. He also advocated that personnel could be appointed without considering politics and that the proportion of "virtue" and "talent" in the criteria for cadres should be changed.

    Wang Haibo also engaged in conspiracy activities in a concealed and cunning manner. Every time he heard anti-Party remarks and so-called big blooming and contending experiences from the leading organs of the Jiu San Society, he trafficked them back. At each meeting, he asked members to report on the situation of their respective units and made arrangements. He also used individual collusion methods to spread information externally.

    In order to instigate others to attack the Party, he frequently wooed or openly supported nine rightist elements within the ministry, including Dai Zhen, Liang Qichang, and Zhao Yue, and cooperated with each other. When rightist elements inside and outside the Party posted big-character posters, Wang Haibo incited them, saying, "Well said, reasonable, in line with the spirit of blooming and contending."

    After the anti-rightist struggle began, Wang Haibo saw that the situation was not good and began to organize retreat activities. On the one hand, he instructed those who were being criticized and could not muddle through to "prepare for the second move," while on the other hand, he pretended to support the anti-rightist struggle and jointly wrote a big-character poster with various democratic parties. However, soon his ugly face was exposed, but he still wanted to quibble, even shamelessly saying: "If I admit my mistakes, I am afraid it will affect the Party's rectification." But the masses will never let him get away with it, and the struggle against this rightist element in the Ministry of Aquatic Products is currently deepening.

　  贩运“私货”制造风波事实俱在
　　王海波怎能蒙混过关
    本报讯　水产部揭发出一个暗藏的阴险狡猾的右派骨干分子王海波。
    王海波是水产部研究室的工作人员，九三学社水产部的负责人。表面上看来王海波是个沉默寡言的人，一开口，马列主义名词一大堆。但是，整风运动一开始，他的狐狸尾巴就露出来了。
    5月3日，王海波在九三学社水产部组织召开的一次会议上就宣告共产党对知识分子的三条“罪状”：第一条是对知识分子的使用不能“人尽其才”，不能“学用一致”；第二条是密件无边和限制研究资料过严；第三条是“对知识分子一般性历史和社会关系问题无限期的纠缠”。他诬蔑党对知识分子的态度是“否定一切”，实行无尽期的排斥态度。
    6月中旬，王海波在水产部召开的整风会议上，又公然对党的人事制度进行了恶毒的攻击。他说，社会主义没有制度，到处糟糕。他攻击现有的领导人有严重的不称职现象，主张把现有的司、局、处、科长，不“称职”的必须降下来。他还主张用人可以不问政治，把干部标准中关于德、才的比重加以改变。
    王海波还用隐蔽的、狡猾的方式进行阴谋活动。他每次在九三学社领导机关听到些反党的言论和所谓大鸣大放的经验，就贩运回来。每次会上叫社员汇报各单位的情况，进行布置。并用个别串连的方法向外传播。
    为了发动其他人向党攻击，他频繁拉拢或公开支持部内右派分子戴镇、梁其昌、赵越等九人并互相配合，当党内外的右派分子贴出大字报时，王海波煽动他们说“讲的好，有道理，符合鸣放精神”。
    反右派斗争开始后，王海波看到形势不妙，就着手组织退却活动，他一面指示被斗而不能蒙混过去的人要“准备第二着”，一面又假装拥护反右派斗争，联合各民主党派写了一张大字报。但不久，他的丑恶面貌就被揭穿了，可是他还想狡赖，甚至无耻地说：“如果我承认自己的错误，只怕会影响党整风。”但群众是决不会让他混过关的，水产部对这个右派分子的斗争目前正在深入中。
