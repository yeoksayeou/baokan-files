Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 22nd: The "Socialist and Capitalist Countries in Figures" recently published by the Soviet State Political Literature Publishing House uses irrefutable figures to prove the boundless superiority of the socialist system and the continuous growth and strengthening of the socialist camp.

According to the statistics in this book, the world population in 1955 was 2,691 million, of which the population of the thirteen socialist countries in Europe and Asia accounted for 35%, totaling 937.8 million; their land area accounted for 26% of the world's total land area, reaching 35,383,300 square kilometers. In the past, there was only one socialist country, the Soviet Union, and its population accounted for less than 8% of the world's total population, and its land accounted for less than 16%.

The book uses a series of figures to illustrate that the development of socialist forces is like the rising sun, while capitalism is constantly declining. In 1917, Soviet Russia's industrial production accounted for only 2% of the world's output, while in 1955, the industrial products of the entire socialist camp reached 30% of the world's industrial products. Among them, the Soviet Union, which accounts for 7.3% of the world's population, produced 19% of the world's industrial products.

From 1950 to 1955, the average annual growth rate of industrial production in the Soviet Union was 13.3%, China was 24.9%, Albania was 24.2%, Bulgaria was 13.1%, Hungary was 13.5%, the German Democratic Republic was 13.1%, Poland was 16.1%, Romania was 15.7%, and Czechoslovakia was 10.8%. At the same time, the United States increased by only 4.3% annually, Britain by 3.4%, and France by 6.3%.

The figures collected in this book show that in the competition between the socialist Soviet Union and the most developed capitalist countries, victory will surely belong to the Soviet Union. From 1913 to 1957, Soviet industrial production increased more than 29 times, while in the same period, the United States increased only three times, and the growth of Britain and France was less than one time; the entire capitalist camp increased by only 1.9 times.

The Soviet Union's agricultural production has also developed rapidly. Now its cultivated land area ranks first in the world.

Other figures listed in this book also prove that the national income and people's cultural living standards of socialist countries are improving faster than those of capitalist countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 22nd: The Soviet "Red Star" newspaper published an article on August 18 stating that in recent years, the Soviet Union's absolute increase in steel and pig iron production has exceeded that of the United States, and is more than the sum of the absolute increase in steel and pig iron production of Britain, France, and West Germany.

The article stated that now, the Soviet Union's pig iron production increases by approximately 3 million tons annually, and steel production increases by more than 3.5 million tons. This is almost equal to the total annual output of pig iron and steel in Tsarist Russia.

The article mentioned that the Soviet Union's absolute output of steel is now second only to the United States, ranking second in the world. In terms of the economic and technical indicators of the steel industry, the Soviet Union surpasses the United States in many aspects. Currently, the Soviet Union can produce approximately 25% more pig iron than the United States using blast furnaces of equal volume; the Soviet Union's utilization index of open-hearth furnace productivity is also much higher than that of the United States.

    数字表明社会主义制度无比优越
　　社会主义力量有如旭日东升
　　苏联钢铁每年绝对增产量超过美国
    据新华社莫斯科22日电　苏联国家政治书籍出版局最近出版的“从数字中看社会主义和资本主义国家”一书，用无可争辩的数字证明了社会主义制度的无比的优越性和社会主义阵营的力量不断增长壮大的情况。
    据这本书的统计，1955年世界人口共有二十六亿九千一百万人，其中欧、亚十三个社会主义国家的人口占35％，共九亿三千七百八十万人；它们的领土面积占世界土地总面积的26％，达三千五百三十八万三千平方公里。而在从前只有苏联一个社会主义国家，它的人口只占世界总人口8％还少一些，土地占不到16％。
    这本书用一系列的数字说明社会主义力量的发展有如旭日东升，而资本主义却在不断地没落。1917年，苏俄的工业生产，仅占世界产量的2％，而在1955年整个社会主义阵营的工业产品就达到了全世界工业产品的30％；其中，占世界人口7.3％的苏联生产的产品，占世界工业产品的19％。
    从1950年到1955年间，苏联每年工业生产增长的速度平均是13.3％，中国是24.9，阿尔巴尼亚是24.2，保加利亚是13.1，匈牙利是13.5，德意志民主共和国是13.1，波兰是16.1，罗马尼亚是15.7，捷克斯洛伐克是10.8。与此同时，美国每年只增加4.3，英国是3.4，法国是6.3。
    这本书所搜集的数字表明，在社会主义苏联同最发达的资本主义国家的竞赛中，胜利一定会属于苏联。从1913年到1957年，苏联工业生产增加二十九倍多，而在同一时期，美国只增加三倍，英、法的增长量连一倍都不到；整个资本主义阵营只增一点九倍。
    苏联的农业生产发展得也很迅速。现在它的耕地面积占世界第一位。
    这本书所列举的其他数字也证明了社会主义国家的国民收入、人民文化生活水平的提高都比资本主义国家要快。
    据新华社莫斯科22日电　苏联“红星报”8月18日发表文章说，最近几年苏联钢和生铁的绝对增产量已经超过了美国，并且多于英国、法国和西德的钢和生铁的绝对增产量的总和。
    文章说，现在，苏联的生铁产量每年大约要增加约三百万吨，钢产量要增加三百五十万吨以上。这差不多等于沙皇俄国时代生铁和钢的全年总产量。
    文章提到，苏联的钢铁绝对产量现在仅次于美国，居世界第二位。而就钢铁工业的经济技术指标来说，苏联在许多方面却超过了美国。现在，苏联用容积相等的高炉可以比美国多生产约25％的生铁；苏联对平炉的生产力的利用指标也比美国高得多。
