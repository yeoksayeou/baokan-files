Purchase More Grain in Bumper Harvest Areas

China has a vast territory and a complex and variable climate. Every year, some areas are inevitably hit by natural disasters. In years of poor harvests, the affected farmland is about 100 to 200 million mu, and the affected population is 60 to 70 million. In years of good harvests, the affected farmland is also tens of millions to 100 million mu, and the affected population is 30 to 40 million. In the four years that have passed in the First Five-Year Plan, there has been only one year of good harvest and two years of poor harvest. In disaster-stricken years and disaster-stricken areas, the amount of grain purchased by the state should be reduced accordingly, while the amount of unified sales should be increased. The state reduces purchases and increases supplies of grain in disaster areas every year by tens of billions to one hundred and several tens of billions of jin. At the same time, national construction is constantly developing, and the demand for grain is increasing year by year. What is the correct way for the state to fill the gap between these grain revenues and expenditures? The only correct way is to purchase 40% of the increased production in years of increased production and in areas of increased production to offset poor harvests with good harvests.

However, there are obstacles to implementing increased production and increased purchases. Last autumn, increased purchases in the bumper harvest provinces of Hubei, Shaanxi, and Gansu were not very smooth. The situation was similar this summer. Anhui Province's summer grain output this year is no lower than that of the bumper harvest summer of 1955, and some areas even exceeded 1955; however, this year's summer grain purchase task for the province has been reduced by more than 100 million jin compared with the summer of 1955. Many other provinces have also reduced purchase figures at each level. Recently, the large-scale debate on grain issues carried out in various places and the strengthening of socialist ideological education for the masses of farmers have improved the situation, but it has not completely improved. Now that the autumn harvest season has arrived, if we cannot effectively implement the method of increasing production and increasing purchases, it will definitely cause many difficulties in the future.

The key to increasing production and increasing purchases is to adhere to the "three fix" grain retention standards and not to easily raise them. To adhere to the "three fix" grain retention standards, we must oppose concealing production. Since last autumn, many agricultural production cooperatives or production teams of cooperatives have underreported unit area yields, underreported planted acreage, did not thresh cleanly, exaggerated disaster situations, concealed production, deceived the state, and secretly raised grain retention standards. According to a preliminary survey of nine counties in Fuyang Prefecture, Anhui Province, 1,223 agricultural cooperatives underreported grain production this summer, accounting for 60% of the total number of agricultural cooperatives in the nine counties. There were 10,286 production teams that underreported production, accounting for 20% of the total number of production teams of agricultural cooperatives in the nine counties. According to a preliminary inspection of 148 production teams in 27 cooperatives in Shuangdui District, Suixi County, the province, 720,000 jin of grain were concealed and distributed privately. This summer, the Third Agricultural Cooperative of Sanhe Township, the county, concealed and privately distributed 123,000 jin, equivalent to 31% of the total output. Similar situations also exist in some other provinces. Obviously, if we do not take various effective measures to expose the phenomenon of concealing production and stop the development of this phenomenon, then it will be impossible for the state to purchase more grain. Shanxi, Anhui, and other provinces have recently launched a struggle against concealing production in conjunction with the large-scale debate on grain issues, which is correct and necessary.

To purchase more grain in areas of increased production, we must also resolutely ban grain speculation. After the implementation of unified purchase and sales, the state controls more than 95% of grain purchase and sales, and only a very small amount of grain is traded in the free grain market under state leadership. However, recently, due to the development of grain demand and the rise of some people's capitalist ideas, the phenomenon of grain speculation has occurred again. Farmers in Hongshui Township, Fuping County, Shaanxi Province, recently revealed that the illegal rich peasant Yang Shengyun's family hoarded more than 8,900 jin of grain. Zhangqiu County, Shandong Province, recently banned a group of grain merchants and peddlers, more than 20 of whom transported more than 1,000 jin each. Many other provinces have also discovered this. This situation should certainly not be allowed to continue. Recently, some provinces have severely banned grain speculation, and some have announced the cancellation of the free grain market. The State Council has also made a decision. These are completely necessary measures to ensure that the state purchases more grain in bumper harvest areas and bumper harvest years, and all localities should conscientiously implement them.

In order to implement the method of increasing production and increasing purchases and achieve the goal of using good harvests to offset poor harvests, grassroots cadres in counties, districts, and townships must have correct ideas and comprehensive viewpoints, and they must use persuasion to resolutely correct the many incorrect behaviors of the masses of farmers, and they must never allow them to go unchecked. After the autumn harvest last year, the party and government leading organs in Yangcheng County, Shanxi Province, found that some agricultural cooperatives concealed grain production and allowed the original agricultural cooperatives to dispose of it themselves. This kind of handling method actually encouraged and condoned the erroneous behavior of underreporting production. As a result, some cooperatives that did not conceal production had their cooperative cadres opposed by the members, and they also concealed production during this year's wheat harvest. This is obviously completely wrong. It should be seen that if the state cannot purchase more grain in bumper harvest years and bumper harvest areas, it will be difficult to enrich grain reserves, and the grain needs of urban industrial and mining areas, disaster areas, and cash crop areas cannot be guaranteed. On this issue, all state personnel must have a full sense of responsibility and strengthen education to the masses to improve everyone's patriotic enthusiasm. Anyone with wrong ideas should seriously analyze and criticize, examine and correct. Only in this way can we achieve practical results.

### 在丰收地区多购一些粮食

　　在丰收地区多购一些粮食
    我国地区辽阔、气候复杂多变，每年都不免有一些地区遭受自然灾害。歉收年头，受灾农田约有一亿到两亿几千万亩，受灾人口六、七千万人。丰收年头，受灾农田也有几千万到一亿亩，受灾人口三、四千万人。在第一个五年计划已经过去的四年中，丰收年只有一个，歉收年倒有两个。在遭灾的年份和遭灾的地区，国家征购粮食的数量要相应减少，而统销数量却要增加。国家每年在灾区减少征购和增加供应的粮食，都要有几十亿斤到一百几十亿斤。同时，国家建设正在不断发展，粮食需要量逐年增长。国家应该用什么办法来填补这些粮食收支的差额呢？唯一的正确办法，就是在增产的年份和增产的地区增购增产部分的40％，以丰补歉。
    但是，实行增产增购并不是没有障碍的。去年秋季，丰收的湖北、陕西、甘肃等省，增购都不很顺利。今年夏季，情形也差不多。安徽省今年夏季产量绝不低于丰收的1955年的夏季，有的地区还超过1955年；但今年全省夏粮征购任务却比1955年夏季减少了一亿多斤。其他不少省份，也层层核减征购数字。最近期间各地开展粮食问题大辩论，加强对农民群众的社会主义思想教育，使局面有了好转，但是还没有完全好转。现在秋收季节到了，如果不能有效地贯彻实行增产增购的办法，那就一定会给将来造成很多的困难。
    增产增购的关键，是坚持“三定”的留粮标准，不要轻易提高。而要坚持“三定”留粮标准，就必须反对隐瞒产量。去年秋季以来，有许多农业生产合作社或社的生产队，少报单位面积产量，少报种植亩数，打场不打净，夸大灾情，隐瞒产量，欺骗国家，暗中提高留粮标准。据安徽省阜阳专区九个县的初步调查，今年夏收中有一千二百二十三个农业社少报粮食产量，占九个县农业社总数的60％。生产队少报产量的有一万零二百八十六个，占九个县农业社生产队总数的20％。据该省濉溪县双堆区二十七个社一百四十八个生产队的初步检查，瞒产私分的粮食有七十二万斤。该县三和乡第三农业社今年夏季瞒产私分十二万三千斤，等于总产量的31％。类似的情况，其他某些省份也有。很明显，如果不采取各种有效的措施来揭发瞒产现象，并且停止这种现象的发展，那末，国家要想多购粮食是办不到的。山西、安徽等省最近期间结合粮食问题大辩论，展开了反瞒产的斗争，这是正确的和必要的。
    要想在增产地区增购粮食，还必须坚决取缔粮食投机。实行统购统销以后，国家掌握了95％以上的粮食购销，只有极少数粮食在国家领导下的粮食自由市场上交易。但是，近来因为粮食需要有所发展，和某些人的资本主义思想抬头，粮食投机的现象又有发生。陕西富平县洪水乡农民最近揭发，不法富农杨升云一家就囤积了八千九百多斤粮食。山东章丘县最近取缔了一批粮商粮贩，其中有二十多人贩运数量都在千斤以上。其他许多省份也都有发现。这种情形当然不应该让它发展下去。最近有些省份严厉取缔粮食投机，有的已经宣布取消了粮食自由市场，国务院也已经作出了决定。这些对于保证国家在丰收地区和丰收年份增购粮食是完全必要的办法，各地应当认真执行。
    为了实行增产增购的办法，达到以丰补歉的目的，县区乡的基层干部必须有正确的思想和全面的观点，对于农民群众中有许多不正确的行为要用说服的办法，坚决加以纠正，而决不可放任。山西阳城县党政领导机关去年秋收后查出一部分农业社隐瞒粮食产量，竟听任原农业社自行支配。这样的处理办法，实际上是鼓励和纵容了瞒报产量的错误行为。结果，有些没有隐瞒产量的社，社干部就遭到了社员的反对，今年麦收中也瞒起产量来了。这显然是完全错误的。应该看到，国家如果不能够在丰收年份和丰收地区多购一些粮食，粮食库存就难以充实，城市工矿区、灾区和经济作物区的粮食需要就不能保证。在这个问题上，所有的国家工作人员必须有充分的责任心，并且向群众加强教育，提高大家的爱国主义热情。谁有错误的思想，就应当认真分析批判，检查纠正。只有这样，才能取得实际的成效。
