Xinhua News Agency, 4th: Middle and primary school graduates across the country who are participating in agricultural production have recently gone to the countryside in batches and happily embarked on the agricultural production front.

As of the end of July, more than 600 graduating middle and primary school students in Shenyang had joined suburban vegetable production cooperatives to participate in agricultural production. Another 400+ high school graduates are interning in the countryside to prepare for future participation in agricultural production. Jinzhou area has 1,033 middle school graduates already on the agricultural production front.

Before going to the countryside, many middle and primary school graduates in Shenyang wrote letters to the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Graduates Work Committee Office, and newspapers, expressing their desire to "take root" in the countryside and become a new generation of educated farmers. Currently, a large number of students who want to go to the countryside are received every day in various districts of the city.

On July 25, the first batch of 202 graduating middle and primary school students from Harbin participating in agricultural production went to the countryside for production. The parents of these graduates and 5,000 students still in school held a farewell party for them. Many graduates who went to the countryside received encouragement from their teachers, classmates, parents, and relatives. Wang Huacheng, the deputy mayor of Harbin, also came to see off these students in person. On July 30, the leaders of the Heilongjiang Province and Harbin City Party and government also braved the rain to visit the middle and primary school graduates who had recently participated in agricultural production in the suburbs of Harbin.

In August, Harbin will have several more batches of graduates going to the countryside to participate in agricultural production.

The first batch of 33 graduating middle and primary school students from Zhengzhou participating in agricultural production left school for the countryside on July 26. Currently, this group of students with excellent academic records has been assigned to agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs of Zhengzhou that produce vegetables, cotton, and other cash crops.

This year, there are more than 70,000 graduating middle school students in Shanghai, of which more than 5,000 did not apply for high school. Among them, many have returned to their hometowns to participate in agricultural production on their own, some have become cooks, others have become cobblers, or followed their fathers to learn traditional Chinese medicine. Xu Shenglin, a junior middle school student at Nanjiao Middle School, did not take the high school entrance exam after graduating this year and went to Zhangmu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhuhang Township as a salesman. He works very hard and is praised by the farmers. On August 1, at the Shanghai Municipal Conference of Activists Among Graduating Middle School Students, he introduced why he likes agriculture. Wu Ziqiang, a senior high school student at Yuqun Middle School, took the stage after listening to the speeches of Xu Shenglin and others, and said that if he failed to get into university, he would go to the countryside.

In Chengdu, in the half-month before and after the announcement of this year's enrollment examination results, hundreds of reporters and tens of thousands of resident activists conducted extensive and in-depth social publicity among the city's residents on the issue of further education and employment for middle and primary school graduates. The Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Women's Federation also organized many report meetings and symposiums, inviting cadres from agricultural cooperatives and handicraft cooperatives to introduce the situation of various industries. Teachers from various schools visited the parents of graduates again, had heart-to-heart talks with the graduates, or organized them to visit agricultural cooperatives and handicraft cooperatives to increase their understanding of labor production. After repeated mobilization, most of the middle and primary school graduates and their parents said that they should make three plans on their own: further education, employment, and self-study. At present, many middle and primary school graduates in Chengdu have directly participated in labor production without further education. Graduates who live in the countryside have returned to agricultural cooperatives, and those who live in towns have expressed that if they are not admitted to schools, they will participate in labor production or study at home.

In Hebei Province, the Communist Youth League organizations at all levels are currently vigorously assisting agricultural cooperatives in making appropriate arrangements for middle and primary school graduates who cannot continue their education this year. According to the instructions of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, local Youth League organizations will continue to strengthen the political and ideological education of graduates after they are placed in production positions, and help them overcome the difficulties encountered in labor. When assigning students to farm work, attention should be paid to their physical strength; Youth League cadres should also establish close ties with students, educate them to establish a correct attitude towards labor, ensure the quality of labor, and avoid the idea of simply pursuing work points.

The first batch of young people in Wuhan who participated in agricultural labor in mid-June have made rapid progress in learning production labor. Many young people have mastered simple farming techniques, methods of raising livestock, etc. In production, they can go wherever needed to work. Young people have received warm care and attention in agricultural cooperatives. In the beginning, they are generally not assigned to heavy farm work. Members of the cooperative with few children care for these young people who go to the countryside to participate in production as if they were their own children.

Not long ago, Guangzhou held a meeting of graduating student representatives. Qin Guifen, a junior middle school graduate from Guangzhou No. 18 Middle School, was praised by everyone. She is a pioneer in Guangzhou's graduating students participating in agricultural production and has been working in an agricultural cooperative for a month. After Qin Guifen arrived at the agricultural cooperative, she immediately participated in publicity work, reading newspapers to farmers, writing propaganda big-character posters and quick reports. The cooperative's civil school also asked her to serve as a teacher, and the cultural club came to her to do recreational tutoring work. Sports activists also asked her to serve as a tutor. All this made her deeply feel how much the countryside today needs educated young people. (with pictures)

    愉快地走上了农业生产战线
    全国各地中小学毕业生
    成批下乡参加农业生产
    新华社4日讯　全国各地参加农业生产的中、小学毕业生们，最近一个时期纷纷成批下乡，愉快地走上了农业生产战线。
    沈阳市到7月底为止，已经有六百多名应届中、小学毕业生到郊区蔬菜生产合作社参加了农业生产。另有四百多名高中毕业生下乡实习，为将来参加农业生产作准备。锦州地区已有一千零三十三名中学毕业生投入农业生产战线。
    在下乡之前，沈阳市许多中、小学毕业生向中共沈阳市委、毕业生工作委员会办公室和报社写了信，表示要到农村“扎根”，作新一代有文化的农民。目前，全市各个区里每天都在接待着要求下乡的大批学生。
    7月25日，哈尔滨第一批参加农业生产的二百零二名应届中、小学毕业生下乡生产去了。这批下乡毕业生的家长和五千名在校的学生为他们举行了欢送会。许多下乡的毕业生都从他们的老师和同学，父母和亲友那里得到了鼓励。哈尔滨市副市长王化成也亲自来欢送这批学生。7月30日，黑龙江省和哈尔滨市党政负责人，还冒雨到哈尔滨市郊看望不久前参加农业生产的中小学毕业生。
    8月间，哈尔滨市还将有几批毕业生下乡参加农业生产。
    郑州市第一批三十三名参加农业生产的应届中、小学毕业生，是7月26日离开学校走向农村的。目前，这一批学习成绩优良的学生，已被分配到郑州近郊的蔬菜、棉花等经济作物区的农业生产合作社里。
    今年上海应届中学毕业生共有七万多人，其中已有五千多人没有报考高中。他们当中有很多人已自行返乡参加农业生产，有的去当厨司、作皮匠或跟父亲学中医。南郊中学初三学生徐生林今年毕业后没有考高中，就到朱行乡张幕农业生产合作社当了推销员，劳动很卖力，受到农民称赞。8月1日，他在上海市应届中学毕业生积极分子大会上，介绍了他为什么喜欢农业的原由。育群中学高三学生吴自强在会上听了徐生林等人的发言以后，登台表示：如果考不上大学，他就到农村去。
    成都在今年招生考试发榜前后的半个月内，由几百名报告员和几万名居民积极分子，就中、小学毕业生升学就业问题，向全市居民展开了广泛深入的社会宣传。共青团市委和妇联还组织了许多报告会和座谈会，邀请农业社、手工业社的干部介绍了各业情况。各校教师再次拜访了毕业生的家长，同毕业生谈心，或组织他们参观访问农业社和手工业社，提高他们对劳动生产的认识。中小学毕业生和家长们经过反复的动员，大都表示要自行作好升学、就业和自学的三种打算。目前，成都已有不少中小学毕业生没升学就直接参加了劳动生产。家在农村的毕业生都回到了农业社，家在城镇的，都纷纷表示，考不取学校就参加劳动生产或在家里自学。
    在河北省，各级共青团组织目前正在大力协助农业社，对今年不能升学的中、小学毕业学生作适当的安置工作。根据共青团河北省委的指示，各地团组织把学生安置在生产岗位后，还要继续加强对毕业生的政治思想教育工作，帮助他们克服在劳动中碰到的困难。在分配学生农活时，注意照顾他们的体力；团干部也和学生们建立密切联系，教育他们树立正确的劳动态度，保证劳动质量，避免单纯追求工分的思想。
    武汉市6月中旬第一批参加农业劳动的青年，在学习生产劳动中进步很快。许多青年已掌握了简单的农活技术，和饲养牲畜的方法等。在生产中，他们都能作到哪里需要，就到哪里去干活。青年们在农业合作社受到了热情的关怀和照顾。开始时，一般都不分配作较重的农活。儿女少的社员，更是像对待亲生儿女一样关怀这批下乡参加生产的青年。
    不久前，广州市举行了应届毕业生代表会议。有一位广州市第十八中学的初中毕业生秦桂芬受了大家的称赞。她是广州市应届毕业生参加农业生产的先行者，到农业社已经工作一个月了。秦桂芬到农业社后，她马上参加了宣传工作，给农民读报、写宣传的大字报、快报，社里的民校也要她去担任教员，文化俱乐部来找她做文娱辅导工作，体育积极分子又要求她担任辅导员，这一切都使她深深地感到，今天的农村是多么需要有文化的青年人。（附图片）
