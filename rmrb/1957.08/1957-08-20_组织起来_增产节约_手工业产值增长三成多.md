Xinhua News Agency report: A production increase and economy drive is vigorously underway in most handicraft cooperative organizations. In Liaoning Province, for example, where it is relatively widespread, 90% of the cooperatives and groups have engaged in the production increase and economy drive.

As a result of the production increase and economy drive, the total output value of handicraft cooperatives (groups) nationwide in the first half of this year has reached 3.87 billion yuan, according to preliminary statistics, an increase of 34.88% compared to the same period last year. In Harbin City, handicraft cooperatives increased production and practiced economy to the tune of 7.21 million yuan in five months. In the Nanning City and Rong County, Guilin, and Pingle Special Districts of Guangxi Province, handicraft cooperative organizations saved more than 267,000 yuan in two months.

At the beginning of this year, handicraft production cooperatives universally felt a lack of raw materials, and some cooperatives had insufficient production tasks. Through the unified arrangements of planning departments and handicraft leadership departments, as well as the active use of waste materials and substitutes by handicraft cooperatives in the production increase and economy drive, these difficulties have been overcome to varying degrees, and most cooperatives are carrying out production normally. Iron and woodworking handicraft cooperatives in rural Hebei Province, when going to the countryside to repair and manufacture agricultural tools for farmers, obtained waste steel through exchange, purchase, and other methods, which basically met their needs for the first half of the year. The Gaoyou County Metal Production Cooperative in Jiangsu Province extracted 200 jin of solder and 42 jin of red copper from waste oil tanks, which can sustain production for more than half a year. The Jiamusi City Leather Production Cooperative in Heilongjiang Province used substitutes such as leopard skin, wild boar skin, and mule skin to overcome the difficulty of insufficient leather. In particular, sewing, knitting, and other handicraft cooperatives that use cotton cloth as raw material have carried out business of dismantling old and renovating, or recycling waste materials and processing them into new products, so that the production tasks are satisfied to a certain extent. For example, the Yuci City Knitting Cooperative in Shanxi Province recovers 700 jin of broken gloves from local state-owned factories and mines every month, producing 150 dozen recycled gloves, and extracting more than 100 jin of machine oil from the gloves. Many sewing cooperatives in Beijing, Shanghai, and other cities dismantle old clothes and renovate them for citizens, generally maintaining production.

According to responsible persons of the Central Handicraft Administration, there are still some cooperatives (groups) that have not launched the production increase and economy drive. Although some cooperatives have launched this drive, they have relaxed inspection and comparison, and cannot develop it persistently and deeply. From the leadership perspective, some handicraft cooperative federations only pay attention to towns and cities, and neglect rural areas; they only pay attention to large cooperatives, and neglect small cooperatives and groups. These shortcomings need to be conscientiously corrected by local handicraft leadership departments.

### 组织起来　增产节约  手工业产值增长三成多

    组织起来　增产节约
    手工业产值增长三成多
    据新华社讯  增产节约运动已经在大部分手工业合作组织中蓬勃开展。开展得比较普遍的如辽宁省已经有90％的社、组投入增产节约运动。
    开展增产节约运动的结果，今年上半年全国手工业合作社（组）的产值，初步统计已经达到三十八亿七千万元，比去年同期增长34.88％。哈尔滨市的手工业社在五个月内就增产节约七百二十一万元。广西省南宁市和容县、桂林、平乐等专区的手工业合作组织，在两个月内节约了二十六万七千多元。
    今年年初，手工业生产合作社普遍感到原材料缺乏，有些社生产任务不足，经过计划部门和手工业领导部门统一安排，以及手工业合作社在增产节约运动中积极地利用废料和代用品，这些困难已不同程度地得到克服，大部分合作社生产进行的正常。河北省农村中的铁木手工业社在下乡为农民修制农具时，用换购、收购等办法，得到的废钢铁基本上满足了上半年的需要。江苏高邮县金属生产社，在废油箱中提炼出焊锡二百斤，紫铜四十二斤，能维持半年多的生产。黑龙江佳木斯市皮革生产社，利用豹子皮、野猪皮、骡皮等代用品，克服了皮张不足的困难。特别是缝纫业、针织业以及其他用棉布作为原料的手工业社，开展拆旧翻新的业务，或者回收废旧物资加工整理成新的产品，生产任务得到一定程度的满足。如山西省榆次市针织社，每月从当地国营厂矿回收破手套七百斤，制出一百五十打再生手套，并从手套中提炼出一百多斤机油。北京、上海等市许多缝纫社为市民拆旧翻新，一般都维持了生产。
    据中央手工业管理局有关负责人谈，目前还有一部分社（组）没有开展增产节约运动，有些合作社虽然开展这个运动，但是放松了检查和评比，不能持久深入地发展。从领导上看，有些手工业合作社联合社只注意城镇，忽视农村；只注意大社，忽视了小社、小组。这些缺点需要各地手工业领导部门认真纠正。
