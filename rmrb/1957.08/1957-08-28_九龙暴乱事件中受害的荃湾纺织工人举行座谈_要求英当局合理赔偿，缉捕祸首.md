Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, August 26th: Hong Kong's "Wen Wei Po" reported yesterday that Tsuen Wan textile workers, who were most deeply affected by the Kowloon riots, criticized the unfair measures taken by the Hong Kong British authorities regarding compensation for victims.

The Hong Kong British authorities issued a statement and report on the issue of compensation for victims of the Kowloon riots on the evening of August 19th. This report, published more than ten months after the riots, stated that the Hong Kong authorities only provided compensation to 610 victims. As for the 254 victims who applied for compensation, the authorities refused to take responsibility for compensation on the pretext that the applicants "failed to provide all the required information" and "lacked sufficient evidence."

More than 100 representatives of textile and dyeing workers from Tsuen Wan criticized this measure by the Hong Kong British authorities at a symposium on the 24th. They pointed out that the welfare institutions under the Hong Kong and Kowloon Textile and Dyeing Trade Workers General Union alone lost more than 42,300 Hong Kong dollars due to sabotage by Kuomintang secret agents. However, the Hong Kong authorities refused to provide any compensation on the grounds that these union organizations "did not fill in the item of whether they had received other assistance," which is very unfair.

The worker representatives who attended the symposium hosted by the Hong Kong and Kowloon Textile and Dyeing Trade Workers General Union also expressed dissatisfaction with the amount of compensation set by the Hong Kong British authorities. Workers from the Nan Hai Textile Mill said that the compensation amount received by the affected workers who received compensation notices from this factory mostly only accounted for 5% to 10% of the losses. The family of Lin Daxin, a worker from Bao Xing Textile Mill who was beaten to death by Kuomintang secret agents, even only received a compensation fee of 1,000 Hong Kong dollars.

The workers attending the symposium also pointed out that recently, some rioters have become arrogant again in Tsuen Wan. Some workers who went to the Hong Kong British court as witnesses in the trial of riot cases have been continuously threatened. The workers attending the symposium unanimously demanded that the Hong Kong British authorities provide reasonable and universal compensation to the victims of the Kowloon riots, and should continue to arrest the chief culprits and effectively protect the lives and property of workers and residents.

　　九龙暴乱事件中受害的荃湾纺织工人举行座谈
　　要求英当局合理赔偿，缉捕祸首
    新华社香港26日电　香港“文汇报”昨天报道，在九龙暴乱事件中受害最深的荃湾纺织工人，批评香港英国当局对受害者的赔偿问题采取的不公平措施。
    香港英国当局8月19日晚上发表了一项对在九龙暴乱事件中受害者进行赔偿问题的声明和报告书。这个距离暴乱事件十个多月才发表的报告书表示，香港当局仅对六百一十宗被害者给予赔偿，而对二百五十四宗申请赔偿的受害者，则以所谓申请人“未能提供所需的一切资料”、“未有充分证据”等理由为借口，拒绝负起赔偿的责任。
    荃湾一百多个纺织染工人代表，在24日的一个座谈会上批评了香港英国当局的这一措施。他们指出，单是纺织染业职工总会属下的福利机构，因为遭受国民党特务的破坏就损失了四万二千三百多元（港币，下同），但是香港当局竟借口这些工会组织“没有填写有否接受其他援助”的项目，全部拒绝赔偿，这是很不公平的。
    出席这个由港九纺织染业职工总会所主持的座谈会的工人代表，对香港英国当局所订定的赔偿数额，也表示了不满的意见。南海纱厂的工人说：这个工厂接到赔偿通知的受害工人，赔偿数目大部分都只占损失5％至10％。宝星纱厂被国民党特务殴打至死的工友林达新的家属，甚至仅仅得到赔偿费一千元。
    出席座谈会的工人还指出：最近时期，有些暴徒在荃湾又嚣张起来。在审讯暴乱案件中，曾经到香港英国法庭充当证人的工人，有人连续受到恐吓。出席座谈会的工人最后一致要求香港英国当局，对在九龙暴乱中的受害者，应该合理普遍赔偿，并且应该继续缉捕元凶祸首，切实保障工人和居民的生命财产安全。
