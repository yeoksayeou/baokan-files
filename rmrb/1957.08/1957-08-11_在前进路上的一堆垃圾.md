A Pile of Garbage on the Road Forward
By our reporter Zhu Bo

For over a month, through the criticism of all faculty, staff, and students of Northwest University, through the exposure and accusations from the masses both inside and outside the university, and through the uprisings of internal members of the right-wing faction, the true face of the right-wing group headed by Liu Butong has been completely revealed.

Based on the existing materials, in addition to Liu Butong (Professor of Economics at Northwest University), the core members also include Cheng Yuanzhen, Qian Zhujun (both Associate Professors of the Economics Department), and Li Shuli (Professor of Political Economics Research Group at Northwest University), among others. Around Liu Butong, there seemed to be countless lines extending to the Economics Department and Chinese Department of Northwest University, to the People's Bank of Xi'an, the Shaanxi Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Bureau, as well as to some right-wing elements in Beijing.

This is a dirty group, including secret agents with blood on their hands, reactionary bureaucrats who consistently hated the people, reactionary landlords, and reactionary bourgeois elements.

This right-wing clique has a fairly long history, and they have experienced new developments during the Great "Blooming" and "Contending." As early as before the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Movement, Liu Butong, Cheng Yuanzhen, and others often gathered together, spreading reactionary remarks, slandering the Party and administrative leaders, provoking discord among teachers, and attempting to seize the leadership of the Economics Department. When right-wing elements across the country attacked the Party, these few who shared the same foul smell automatically formed a small anti-Party and anti-people clique. During this period, more than a dozen right-wing elements were drawn in, including Feng Zenglie, a teacher from the Chinese Department within the university, and right-wing student Huang Guoxiang, as well as Deng Yun, a right-wing element from the People's Bank of Xi'an, Ma Lianke, a right-wing element from the Shaanxi Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Bureau, and some right-wing elements in Beijing. Liu Butong once boasted that the right-wing forces were very strong, and as long as he called for it in the Economics Department, everyone would raise their hands. Their methods of attracting people were very clever. For example, when Liu Butong went to the Provincial People's Hospital for treatment, he met a doctor surnamed Li, and he asked him with ulterior motives whether he had statistically analyzed mental patients, and whether there were more than in the past? He also said that there were mental patients among the farmers now, which was caused by agricultural collectivization. Li was also someone who harbored dissatisfaction with the Party, and after this conversation, the two connected. Liu used the opportunity of inspection (Liu was a representative of the Xi'an Municipal Political Consultative Conference) to bring in Deng Yun, a right-wing element from the People's Bank. Deng reported to Liu on the shortcomings in the bank's Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries, individual Party members' corruption, and the situation of "blooming and contending" during the rectification campaign. Liu asked Deng to write big-character posters, turning the shortcomings of individual leaders in the bank into articles for the Wenhui Bao and Dagong Bao, and Deng did so.

During the "Blooming and Contending," Liu Butong said to his lackeys: "Be bold in 'blooming,' don't be afraid of them calling you a small clique"; Cheng Yuanzhen and others shouted loudly that they wanted to "settle old scores" with the Party. They attended seminars everywhere, spreading anti-Soviet and anti-Party remarks. Their reactionary remarks were all discussed beforehand. For example, Liu Butong, Qian Zhujun, and Li Shuli all participated in the seminar organized by Guangming Daily in Xi'an. Liu Butong asked Qian Zhujun to talk about the issue of democratic parties, attacking the Party's leadership from this issue; Cheng Yuanzhen supplied Li Shuli with the materials of the Economics Department's Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries, and Li Shuli attacked the Party's leadership from this issue, while Liu Butong took on the main role of attacking the Party. According to the right-wing elements themselves, during this period, they met almost every day at Liu Butong's or Qian Zhujun's house to exchange views. They also reported to each other about the situation after attending the seminars. For example, Liu Butong participated in the Xi'an Political Consultative Conference seminar, and introduced the situation at the meeting to other right-wing elements, and others also introduced to Liu Butong the situation of their attendance at the seminars.

This right-wing clique has political ambitions. After the 20th Congress of the CPSU, especially after the Hungarian and Polish incidents, they believed that the socialist camp was in a "process of regression," and that "a Hungarian incident may also occur in China." Qian Zhujun speculated that under the conditions that the broad masses of people cannot get enough to eat today, it would cause riots and turmoil. Liu Butong said, "Now the 'blooming and contending' is only in government organs and universities, and there are so many problems, and it will be even worse when it goes to factories and rural areas... 'Blooming and contending' in factories and rural areas will definitely lead to beatings." Cheng Yuanzhen believed that today's society is even darker than the old society.

They also had further plans. Liu Butong, Qian Zhujun and others planned to go to the countryside during the summer vacation to "light fires." Qian Zhujun also fantasized about splitting the Communist Party into two parties, or organizing a "Peasant Party" to replace the leadership of the Communist Party. Qian Zhujun admitted that he first wanted to change the sky over Northwest University. He openly proposed to establish a "Faculty and Staff Representative Assembly." This "Faculty and Staff Representative Assembly" would be above the Party Committee, and would refuse the Party Committee to participate, in order to seize the leadership of the Party. Deng Yun of the People's Bank also actively moved to re-elect the manager of the bank, in order to seize leadership. Huang Guoxiang, a right-wing student associated with Liu Butong, called on "brave people" to organize. These "brave people" did gather in Classroom 41, frantically shouting to abolish the leadership of the university's Party Committee.

The series of anti-Party and anti-people activities carried out by this right-wing clique have been exposed by the masses, and have undergone countless criticisms. However, the struggle is not yet over. Right-wing elements such as Liu Butong are still stubbornly resisting the people's counterattack, especially Liu Butong's attitude is very bad. He refuses to attend meetings, and does not allow his lackeys to conduct self-criticism. Liu Butong also encouraged these right-wing elements, saying: "So what if you are a right-winger, anyway, it is a contradiction among the people," "Without right-wingers, there would be no left-wingers!" He also said, "The Communist Party does everything in a whirlwind. During the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries, it was proposed that they would never withdraw their troops without winning a complete victory, but in the end they didn't withdraw their troops. At worst, this time I will be labeled as a right-winger..." However, Liu Butong did not expect that all the teachers and students of Northwest University have become stronger after this month-long struggle. No matter how stubborn Liu Butong and others are, without winning a complete victory, this political struggle will never end.

    在前进路上的一堆垃圾

    一个多月以来，经过西北大学全体教职员工和学生的批判，经过校内外群众的检举揭发，以及右派分子内部人员的起义，以刘不同为首的右派集团的面目完全暴露出来了。
    从现有的材料看，除刘不同（西大经济学教授）外，骨干分子还有程元斟、钱祝钧（都是经济系副教授）、李述礼（西大政治经济学教研组教授）等。在刘不同身边，好像有无数条线，伸向西大的经济系、中文系，伸向西安市人民银行，陕西省邮电局以及在北京的一些右派分子。
    这是肮脏的一群，其中有两手沾着人民鲜血的特务，有一贯仇视人民的反动官僚，反动地主，以及反动资产阶级分子等。
    这个右派小集团有了相当久的历史了，他们趁大“鸣”大“放”的机会又有新的发展。早在肃反运动以前，刘不同、程元斟等就经常在一起，散布反动言论，诬蔑党和行政领导，挑拨教师之间的关系，并企图夺取经济系的领导权。当右派分子在全国各地向党进攻时，这几个臭味相投的人便自动的形成了一个反党反人民的小集团。在这一时期被他们拉拢上的右派分子有十多个，其中有校内的中文系的教师冯增烈，和右派学生黄国湘，以及西安市人民银行的右派分子邓云，陕西省邮电局的右派分子马连科，以及北京的某些右派分子等。刘不同曾吹嘘过右派分子力量很大，只要他在经济系一号召，都会举起手来的。他们拉拢人的手段很高明，如刘不同到省人民医院看病时，碰到该院的一个姓李的医生，他别有用心地问他统计过精神病者没有，是否比过去多？并说现在农民中有精神病者，是农业合作化造成的。李也是个对党心怀不满的人，经过这一谈，两个人就联系到一起了。刘利用视察的机会（刘是西安市政协代表），把人民银行的右派分子邓云拉上了。邓把银行肃反中的缺点，个别党员贪污问题，以及整风中“鸣放”的情况向刘汇报：刘要邓出大字报，把银行个别领导人员中的缺点写成文章给文汇报和大公报，邓都照办。
    在“鸣”“放”中，刘不同曾对他的喽啰们说：“要大胆地‘放’，不要怕他们说小集团”；程元斟等则大喊大叫要和党“算旧账”。他们到处参加座谈会，散布反苏反党的言论。他们的反动言论，都是商量过的。例如光明日报在西安组织的座谈会，刘不同、钱祝钧、李述礼都参加了。刘不同叫钱祝钧谈民主党派的问题，从这个问题上攻击党的领导；程元斟就把经济系的肃反材料供给李述礼，李述礼从这个问题上攻击党的领导，刘不同则担任攻击党的主要的角色。据右派分子自己承认，这一时期，他们差不多天天在刘不同或钱祝钧家碰头，交换意见。他们参加座谈会后，也互相汇报情况。如刘不同参加了西安政协座谈会，就把会议上的情况向其他右派分子介绍，其他人也向刘不同介绍自己出席座谈会的情况。
    这个右派集团是有政治野心的。从苏共二十次代表大会后，特别是匈、波事件之后，他们认为社会主义阵营处于“倒退过程”，“中国也可能发生匈牙利事件”。钱祝钧推测在今天广大人民吃不饱的条件下，就会引起骚乱和暴动。刘不同说，“现在‘鸣放’只是在政府机关和高等学校里，问题就这样多，将来要到工厂和农村，就更不得了，……‘鸣放’到了工厂和农村一定要打人”。程元斟认为，今天的社会比旧社会还黑暗。
    他们还进一步的计划，刘不同、钱祝钧等计划利用暑假到农村去“点火”，钱祝钧还幻想把共产党分裂为两个党，或者组织一个“农民党”代替共产党的领导。钱祝钧承认他首先要变西北大学的天，他公开提出要成立“教工代表大会”。这个“教工代表大会”驾凌于党委之上，并拒绝党委参加，来夺取党的领导。人民银行邓云也积极活动改选银行的经理，来夺取领导权。和刘不同有联系的右派学生黄国湘号召“勇敢的人”组织起来。这些“勇敢的人”真的在四十一教室聚会了，疯狂地叫喊着要取消校党委的领导。
    这个右派集团所进行的一系列反党反人民的活动被群众揭发出来了，并经过了无数次的批判。但是，斗争还未结束，刘不同等右派分子还在顽强的抵抗人民的反击，特别是刘不同的态度十分恶劣，他拒绝参加会议，并且还不让他的喽啰进行检查，刘不同还鼓励这些右派分子们说：“右派就右派，反正是人民内部矛盾”，“没有右派，还没有他们左派呢！”他还说，“共产党搞啥都是一阵风，肃反时曾提出不获全胜决不收兵，结果还不是收了兵，这次大不了戴个右派分子的帽子。……”但是，刘不同没有想到，西大的全体师生，经过这一个多月的斗争锻炼，都更加坚强了，不管刘不同等人如何顽强，不获全胜，决不会结束这场政治斗争。
