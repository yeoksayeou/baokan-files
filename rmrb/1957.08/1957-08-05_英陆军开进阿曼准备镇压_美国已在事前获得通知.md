Xinhua News Agency, August 4th: Manama (in Bahrain) dispatch: British military commander for the Arabian Peninsula, Air Vice-Marshal Sinclair, announced in Manama on August 3rd that British ground forces began entering Muscat on August 3rd to suppress the Omani insurgents.

He said that an offensive would be launched soon, at an undisclosed time. The British Air Force would also participate.

Sinclair said that the British ground forces being mobilized were entering the coastal area of Muscat, where supporters of the Sultan of Muscat, Taimur, were gathering.

Sinclair said that the Cameron Highlanders were moving into Muscat, and some armored vehicles from the 15th and 19th Hussars stationed in Aden were also en route there.

He also said that "at this stage, speed is very important," and British forces would soon advance on Nizwa, the headquarters of the insurgents.

Agence France-Presse reported on August 3rd, citing British Foreign Office officials in London, that the purpose of British ground forces participating in the suppression of the Omani insurgents was to reverse the unfavorable political situation and to enable the Sultan of Muscat's forces to reoccupy Nizwa militarily.

Another dispatch from London: A British Foreign Office spokesman said on August 3rd that the United States had been notified of Britain's sending ground forces to Muscat.

When Dulles was in London, he discussed the Omani situation with British Prime Minister Macmillan and had frequent contact with Foreign Secretary Lloyd. Sources say that during these meetings and contacts, Dulles was already aware of some of Britain's military deployments.

In the two days before this, American officials had said that the United States' position on the Omani situation was to seek a swift "solution." Therefore, Washington believes that Britain's military suppression in Oman is "necessary." Sources say that American officials fear that if the fighting spreads, Saudi Arabia will openly join the battle, which would put the United States in a dilemma between Britain and Saudi Arabia.

    英陆军开进阿曼准备镇压
    美国已在事前获得通知
    据新华社4日讯　马纳马（在巴林岛）消息：阿拉伯半岛英军司令辛克莱空军少将8月3日在马纳马宣布，英国的地面部队从8月3日起开始进入马斯喀特，前往镇压阿曼起义者。
    他说，不久，将在一个不宣布的时刻发动进攻。英国空军也将参加。
    辛克莱说，调动中的英国地面部队正在进入马斯喀特沿海地区，在那里集合着马斯喀特苏丹泰穆尔的拥护者。
    辛克莱说，喀麦隆高地人部队正在开入马斯喀特，驻亚丁的第十五和第十九骠骑兵队的若干装甲车也在向那里进发的途中。
    他还说，“在现阶段，速度是十分重要的”，英军将很快向起义者总部所在地尼兹瓦推进。
    据法新社8月3日援引伦敦外交部官员的话说，英国地面部队参加对阿曼起义者的镇压，目的是想扭转在政治上的不利局面，并且在军事上使马斯喀特苏丹的部队可以重新占领尼兹瓦。
    另据伦敦消息：英国外交部发言人8月3日说，英国派地面部队去马斯喀特的事曾经通知过美国。
    杜勒斯在伦敦的时候，曾经同英国首相麦克米伦商谈阿曼事件，而且同外交大臣劳埃德频频接触。有消息说，在这些会谈和接触中，杜勒斯已经知道英国的一些军事部署。
    在这前两天，美国官员曾经说，美国在阿曼事件上的立场是希望求得迅速“解决”。因此，华盛顿认为英国在阿曼的军事镇压行动是
  “必要”的。有消息说，美国官员怕战斗蔓延下去沙特阿拉伯会公开参加战斗，这样就会使美国在英国和沙特阿拉伯之间处于两难的地位。
