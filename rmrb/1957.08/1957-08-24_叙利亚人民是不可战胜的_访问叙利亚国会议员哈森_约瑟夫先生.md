　　The Syrian People Are Invincible
　　——Interview with Syrian Parliamentarian Mr. Hassan Youssef
　　By Our Correspondent Feng Zhidan
    Although Mr. Hassan Youssef is already sixty years old, his spirit remains as vibrant as a young man. He is an enthusiastic patriot and an active advocate for world peace. He is currently a member of the Syrian Parliament, a member of the Syrian Peace Committee, a member of the World Peace Council, and a member and one of the initiators of the Syrian-Chinese Friendship Association.
    Recently, due to the blatant aggression and subversive conspiracies of American imperialism against Syria, people are closely watching the situation in Syria. Mr. Youssef is, of course, even more concerned about the fate of his homeland. He mentioned with great indignation the recent American conspiracies against Syria. He said, "The American conspiracies against Syria are by no means this one, but many times over. The masterminds behind these conspiracies are all American embassies in Damascus, Beirut, Baghdad, and other places."
    To illustrate this point, Mr. Youssef cited a conspiracy case jointly planned by the United States, Britain, and France on the eve of the Suez War. They used Iraq to smuggle weapons to conspirators in Syria. At that time, Turkish troops had already gathered on the Syrian border under the direction of Washington. The situation was once precarious. However, the Syrian government cracked down on this subversive group, arrested criminals who betrayed the country, and even exhibited the seized weapons in the square. The evidence of imperialism's attack on Syria educated the Syrian people and raised their vigilance against imperialism.
    Mr. Youssef reviewed the situation in the past six months and especially mentioned the turmoil in Aleppo in February this year, exposing the vicious and sinister methods of the United States. He said, "The United States wanted to create riots in Aleppo, so it viciously provoked the relationship between Muslims and Christians in Aleppo. American mercenaries deliberately burned down a Christian church, and at the same time, they tried to incite Christian residents to burn down mosques. The United States attempted to make Syrians kill each other, so that Aleppo would be immersed in blood in order to fish in troubled waters and interfere in Syria."
    However, the American conspiracy in Aleppo was once again crushed. He said, "This is how the United States has attacked Syria time and time again, but the facts have proved that it is not the Syrian people who fail each time, but the United States itself."
      "Of course, we must still be vigilant against new American conspiracies; however, in any case, it is fundamentally impossible for the United States to enslave the Syrian people and issue orders in Syria." Mr. Youssef became more and more impassioned as he spoke, his voice filled with hatred for imperialism and loyalty to his country.
    Mr. Youssef's words are absolutely true: imperialism cannot defeat the heroic Syrian people. With his forty years of experience in participating in the struggle for national independence, Mr. Youssef told the reporter about the heroic tradition of patriotism of the Syrian people.
    "If you want me to talk about the heroic struggle of the Syrian people, I can't finish it in a few days and nights," Mr. Youssef said, not to mention the Syrian people's resistance to Turkish foreign rule for hundreds of years, "during the thirty years of French colonial rule, whether in cities, in villages, or in the desert, the Syrian people constantly attacked the French colonists, making it impossible for the enemy to breathe. The strike movements in the cities often lasted for several months. Young men often attacked the barracks and哨所 of the French aggressor troops at night, and used the weapons seized from the French colonists to fight the French colonists. Women hated the colonists and secretly threw eggshells and beetroots on the faces of the colonial soldiers. Ingenious people also sculpted ugly images of the colonial army and put them on the streets for the people to spurn..."
    Mr. Youssef mentioned the Syrian people's anti-French uprising from 1925 to 1927, a national uprising that almost shook France's colonial rule in Syria. This uprising of the Syrian people also cooperated with the uprisings of the people of China, India, Indonesia, Egypt, and Morocco against imperialism in the 1920s, and formed a huge torrent of colonial people's revolution.
    It is this unyielding people who, after gaining independence, are once again facing the threat of imperialist aggression. Can it be believed that such a heroic people will be intimidated by imperialist aggressive forces? The answer is, of course, "No!" Mr. Youssef said, "I dare to swear that our people are determined to defend the independence of our country and strike at the aggressors. In fact, since the outbreak of the Suez War, the Syrian army has been constantly on guard, ready to give a powerful counterattack to any imperialist aggression. Not only Syrian men, but also young women are receiving military training..."
    Speaking of this, Mr. Youssef pointed to his daughter Mona, who was sitting next to him, and said, "She can throw grenades and fire machine guns." As he spoke, he handed a teacup to his daughter, asking her to try lying down and throwing a grenade. Mona skillfully performed this military action in front of us. Then Mr. Youssef said heroically, "If imperialism dares to invade Syria's borders, my daughter will also join the battle, and even I, the old man, will stand up and fight. Our entire people cannot allow anyone to infringe upon the independence of our country. And this is precisely what the United States has not understood to this day, and the stupidity of imperialism is manifested here!"
    Mr. Youssef has infinite confidence in the people of his country, but he is also full of contempt and disdain for imperialism. He spoke very contemptuously of the "Eisenhower Doctrine." He said, "This is a madman's plan. Indeed, this is dangerous for the Arab people; but I want to say that this is even more dangerous for the United States itself." Mr. Youssef quoted a famous saying from the Koran: "Sometimes, bad things are often good things for us. That's absolutely right, if the United States were not so ferocious, the Syrian people might not have seen the true face of the United States, and the Syrian patriotic forces might not have been able to unite as they are now."
    Mr. Youssef's conversation shows that the Syrian people understand very well that they are by no means isolated in their struggle against imperialism and defending the independence of their country, and that they have the sympathy and support of hundreds of millions of peace-loving people around the world. Mr. Youssef first spoke of the great friendship of the Soviet Union towards the Syrian people. He believes that the recent provocative propaganda of the United States regarding Soviet-Syrian relations is completely a slander and defamation.
    "Not only the Soviet Union," Mr. Youssef concluded, "the Syrian people firmly believe that the people of Arab countries, socialist countries, and the countries of the Bandung Conference are all reliable friends of the Syrian people."
    Finally, at the end of the interview, Mr. Youssef once again enthusiastically emphasized the friendship between the people of China and Syria. He said:
    "I want to thank the Chinese people for the noble friendship they have shown to the Syrian people. Imperialism is the common enemy of our two peoples, we are comrades in the struggle, and we are friends in spirit. I want to shout: Long live the fraternal friendship between the people of China and Syria! Long live! Long live!"

　　叙利亚人民是不可战胜的
　　——访问叙利亚国会议员哈森·约瑟夫先生
　　本报记者　冯之丹
    哈森·约瑟夫先生虽然已是六十岁的老人了，但是他的精神仍像年青人一样的饱满。他是一个热情的爱国者，世界和平事业的积极活动家。他现在是叙利亚的国会议员、叙利亚和平委员会委员、世界和平理事会的理事，并且是叙中友好协会的委员和发起人之一。
    最近，由于美帝国主义对叙利亚进行着露骨的侵略活动和颠覆阴谋，人们密切地关注着叙利亚的形势。约瑟夫先生当然更加关心他的祖国的命运。他十分愤慨地提到最近美国对叙利亚的阴谋活动。他说：“美国对叙利亚的阴谋，绝不是最近这一次，而已经是很多次了。这些阴谋的幕后策划者都是美国驻大马士革、贝鲁特和巴格达等地的美国大使馆”。
    约瑟夫先生为了说明这个问题，举出了苏伊士战争前夕，美国和英法等共同策划的一次阴谋案。它们利用伊拉克给叙利亚的阴谋分子偷运武器。当时土耳其的军队已在华盛顿的指使下向叙利亚边境集结。形势曾经是险恶的。可是，叙利亚政府破获了这个颠覆集团，逮捕了叛卖祖国的犯罪分子，并且还把缴获的武器放在广场上展览。帝国主义进攻叙利亚的罪证教育了叙利亚人民，提高了他们对于帝国主义的警惕性。
    约瑟夫先生回顾了半年来的形势，并且特别谈到了今年2月间阿勒颇的那次骚动，揭露了美国的毒辣而阴险的手段。他说：“美国想在阿勒颇制造骚乱，因此它就恶毒地挑拨了阿勒颇的穆斯林和基督教徒的关系。美国的雇佣分子故意地焚毁了一座基督教堂，同时又竭力煽动基督教居民去焚毁清真寺。美国企图使叙利亚人自相残杀，使得阿勒颇浸沉在血泊里以便混水摸鱼，来干涉叙利亚。”
    但是，美国在阿勒颇的阴谋又被粉碎了。他说，“美国就是这样一次又一次地向叙利亚进攻的，但是事实证明，每一次失败的不是叙利亚人民，而是美国自己。”
      “当然，我们还必须警惕美国的新的阴谋；可是，无论如何，美国要想奴役叙利亚人民，在叙利亚发号施令，这是根本办不到的。”约瑟夫先生越谈越慷慨激昂，他的声音里充满着对于帝国主义的愤恨和对于自己祖国的忠诚。
    约瑟夫先生的话是千真万确的：帝国主义不可能战胜英勇的叙利亚人民。约瑟夫先生以他四十年参加争取民族独立斗争的经历，向记者谈到了叙利亚人民的爱国主义的英勇传统。
    “要我谈叙利亚人民的英勇斗争，那是几天几夜都讲不完的”，约瑟夫先生说，且不提叙利亚人民几百年间反抗土耳其的异族统治，“在法国殖民统治的三十年间，无论在城市、在乡村、在沙漠里，叙利亚人民不停地打击法国殖民者，使敌人时常不得喘息。城市里的罢工运动常常坚持几个月。年青的男子常常在夜晚袭击法国侵略军的军营和岗哨，并且用从法国殖民者那里夺来的武器打法国殖民者。妇女们仇恨殖民者，偷偷地把鸡蛋壳和甜菜根扔到殖民军士兵的脸上。机智的人们还塑了殖民军的丑像放在大街上让人民唾弃……”。
    约瑟夫先生提到了叙利亚人民1925—1927年的反法大起义，这一次全国性的起义几乎动摇了法国在叙利亚的殖民统治。叙利亚人民的这次起义，还配合了中国、印度、印度尼西亚、埃及和摩洛哥人民在本世纪二十年代的反对帝国主义的起义，而汇成了一股殖民地人民革命的巨大的洪流。
    就是这样不屈的人民，今天在获得了独立以后再度面临着帝国主义侵略的威胁。难道能够相信，这样英勇的人民会被帝国主义侵略势力所吓倒吗？回答当然是：“不！”约瑟夫先生说：“我敢于起誓，我们的人民是有决心保卫祖国的独立和打击侵略者的。事实上从苏伊士战争爆发的时候起，叙利亚军队就时刻警戒着，准备给予帝国主义的任何侵犯以有力的反击。不仅是叙利亚的男子，而且青年妇女都在受着军事训练……”
    说到这里，约瑟夫先生指着在旁边坐着的他的女儿莫娜说：“她就能扔手榴弹和开机枪”。说着他就把一个茶杯递给他的女儿，要她试作卧倒和扔手榴弹的动作。莫娜熟练地在我们面前做了这个军事动作。接着约瑟夫先生豪迈地说：“如果帝国主义敢于侵犯叙利亚的国境，我的女儿也会参加作战，就是我老头儿也要起来战斗。我们全国人民不能允许任何人侵犯我们祖国的独立。而这一点正是美国直到今天所没有理解的，帝国主义的愚蠢也就是表现在这里！”
    约瑟夫先生对于他祖国的人民怀着无限的信心，但他对于帝国主义又是满怀着蔑视和鄙视的感情。他非常轻蔑地谈到了“艾森豪威尔主义”。他说：“这是一个疯子的计划。的确，这对阿拉伯人民是危险的；可是我要说这对美国自己更是危险的。”约瑟夫先生引用古兰经的名言说：“有时候，坏事情往往对我们是很好的事情。完全正确，要不是美国这样的凶恶，叙利亚人民也许还看不清美国的真面目，也许叙利亚爱国力量还不能够像现在那样地团结起来呢。”
    约瑟夫先生的谈话说明，叙利亚人民非常懂得他们在反对帝国主义，保卫自己祖国独立的斗争中绝不是孤立的，他们有着全世界亿万爱好和平的人民的同情和支持。约瑟夫先生首先谈到了苏联对叙利亚人民的伟大的友谊。他认为，最近美国关于苏叙关系的挑拨性的宣传完全是一种毁谤和污蔑。
    “不仅是苏联”，约瑟夫先生的结论是：“叙利亚人民深信，阿拉伯国家的人民、社会主义国家以及万隆会议各国的人民都是叙利亚人民的可靠的朋友。”
    最后在结束访问的时候，约瑟夫先生再一次热情地强调了中、叙两国人民的友谊。他说：
    “我要感谢中国人民对叙利亚人民所表现的崇高的友谊。帝国主义是我们两国人民的共同的敌人，我们在斗争中是同志，在精神上是朋友。我要高呼：中叙两国人民的兄弟友谊万岁！万岁！万岁！”
