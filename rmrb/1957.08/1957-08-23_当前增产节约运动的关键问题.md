The large-scale increase production and practice economy campaign was carried out relatively well in the first half of this year, and the completion of the national plan was relatively satisfactory. The masses in many enterprises tried every possible means to overcome the difficulties of insufficient raw materials and ensured and increased production. However, recently, some enterprises failed to revise their outdated increase production and practice economy plans in a timely manner; some enterprises did not check their increase production and practice economy plans for a long time; and many enterprises almost relaxed their research on production situations and the work of promoting advanced experience and launching rationalization proposals. Party committees, trade unions, and various economic departments in various regions should pay serious attention to these phenomena.

The deadline for the completion of the first Five-Year Plan is only a few months away; the second Five-Year Plan needs to be actively prepared; and various enterprises are carrying out or preparing to carry out rectification and socialist education movements. This requires the leadership to make reasonable arrangements to ensure the victorious progress of the rectification movement and the socialist education movement, and at the same time, continue to carry out the increase production and practice economy campaign, so that we can successfully complete the first Five-Year Plan and prepare for the second Five-Year Plan.

The primary key to continuing to carry out the increase production and practice economy campaign is to solve the ideological problems of the cadres. Some people think that the increase production and practice economy campaign in the first half of the year was carried out relatively well, and the completion of the national plan was also good, so they feel that the problem is not big and they can relax. This idea is obviously wrong. This is a one-sided assessment of the actual work. It is true that the increase production and practice economy campaign was carried out relatively well in the first half of the year, and the completion of the national plan was also relatively good. However, this does not mean that there were no problems in the work in the first half of the year. The decline in the quality of some products and the increase in personal and equipment accidents in some units in the first half of the year are serious problems that need to be paid attention to in the increase production and practice economy campaign. As far as capital construction is concerned, the plan has not been completed well enough. Moreover, some problems seem to have been solved in the first half of the year, but in reality, they cannot be solved by short-term efforts. For example, the difficulty of insufficient raw materials was solved to some extent and eased to some extent in the first half of the year, but for a country like ours with a large population and a backward economic base, the shortage of certain construction materials will not be a short-term phenomenon. Increasing the production of raw materials and saving raw materials are also long-term tasks. Continuous efforts are needed to fundamentally overcome the difficulties in this regard. Quality, safety, raw materials, etc., are all major issues in the industrial sector. These problems have not been completely solved, so how can we say "the problem is not big" and "we can relax"?

Some people believe that there are many difficulties in industrial production this year, and it has been very difficult to achieve such great results in the first half of the year. It will be difficult to increase production and practice economy again in the second half of the year. This idea is also unfounded. "The stars in the sky cannot be counted, and the potential for production cannot be exhausted." This is a popular saying among workers, and it is very reasonable. Recently, many enterprises have revised their increase production and practice economy plans for the second half of the year and found that there is still great potential. For example, the state-owned industrial and transportation departments in Tianjin originally planned to increase production and practice economy by 75 million yuan this year, and they have completed two-thirds of it in the first half of the year. Recently, they revised the plan and strived to increase production and practice economy by 100 million yuan for the whole year, which is one-third higher than the original plan. The Anshan Iron and Steel Works decided to increase iron production by 12,000 tons and save 1 million yuan in the second half of the year. The six mining bureaus under the Harbin Coal Industry Administration also decided to increase coal production for the country by 670,000 tons in the second half of the year, which is almost double the annual increase production plan formulated at the beginning of the year. How can we ignore these potentials in production and be complacent?

Correctly understanding and handling the relationship between the increase production and practice economy campaign and the rectification movement and the socialist education movement is very important for continuing to deepen the increase production and practice economy campaign. After the rectification movement and the socialist education movement are carried out in enterprises, the attention of the broad masses of workers will be drawn to this aspect, which is a natural and normal phenomenon. We should organize the broad masses of workers to actively participate in this major political and ideological struggle. This is a struggle between the two roads of capitalism and socialism. The broad masses of workers will receive a vivid socialist education from this struggle. The rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle can be completely combined with the increase production and practice economy campaign. The rectification movement opposes subjectivism, sectarianism, and bureaucracy, and examines the implementation of the policy of "building the country diligently and thriftily," which will not only not affect the increase production and practice economy campaign, but will also greatly promote the increase production and practice economy campaign. After many enterprises carried out the socialist education movement, they helped the masses draw a clear line between socialist ideology and capitalist ideology, greatly improved the class consciousness of the workers, increased their ability to distinguish between right and wrong, and had a higher awareness of correctly handling the relationship between national interests and individual interests, long-term interests and immediate interests, so that evil spirits declined and righteousness rose, and they further played their initiative and creativity in production. It can be seen that the rectification movement and the socialist education movement can be completely combined with the increase production and practice economy campaign. Of course, due to carrying out several aspects of work at the same time, the leadership's energy will be somewhat dispersed, and there will be some contradictions in the allocation of time, which requires a good arrangement. As long as we make reasonable arrangements for these aspects of work, we can ensure the victorious development of the rectification movement and the socialist education movement, and will not neglect the increase production and practice economy campaign.

To reverse the slackening phenomenon of the increase production and practice economy campaign, it is also necessary to vigorously strengthen the organization of the movement. There are many things that should be done in this regard. We would like to put forward some suggestions here.

First, we must summarize and promote advanced experience and continue to carry out the advanced producer movement. This is an important link in carrying out the increase production and practice economy campaign. Some people think that there is no increase production task here, so there is no need to promote advanced experience, which is wrong. Advanced experience is multi-faceted, and each enterprise should promote advanced experience in different aspects according to the different tasks and the different production keys. If we abandon the summarization and promotion of advanced experience, the increase production and practice economy campaign will not achieve the due effect.

Second, we must launch rationalization proposals and hold good production meetings. This is a good way to concentrate the wisdom of the masses and solve the key problems in production. In the past, many enterprises had special institutions to handle rationalization proposals, but now some enterprises have abolished these special institutions, so that rationalization proposals are in a state of being unattended. We believe that this phenomenon of rationalization proposals being unattended must be changed immediately. Leaders should constantly point out the key points in production, put forward topics, and mobilize the masses to put forward rationalization proposals to solve these key production problems.

Third, we must evaluate the results of the competition in a timely manner and reward advanced producers. In terms of evaluation, in the past, most of them were evaluated once a month, which took too much time, and the content of the evaluation was too cumbersome, which was not conducive to truly summarizing experience through evaluation. Later, it was changed to one evaluation per quarter, but in fact, some enterprises did not even achieve one evaluation per quarter. In terms of rewards, in the past, some enterprises had too wide a range of rewards, with all kinds of things and many tricks, which lost the practical effect of rewards. However, in opposing this unreasonable phenomenon, some enterprises simply canceled the rewards. We believe that we can study some appropriate ways to evaluate awards, but there must be evaluation and rewards.

Fourth, we must conduct a serious inspection of the completion of the increase production and practice economy plan in this period. Only through this inspection can we summarize experience, discover shortcomings, clarify the direction, and on this basis, mobilize the masses to revise the increase production and practice economy plan, so as to continue to deepen the increase production and practice economy campaign in the rectification movement and the socialist education movement, and use the great results of increasing production and practicing economy to counterattack the attacks of the bourgeois rightists.

### 当前增产节约运动的关键问题

　　当前增产节约运动的关键问题
    大规模的增产节约运动在今年上半年开展得比较好，国家计划完成的情况比较令人满意。许多企业的群众千方百计地克服了原材料不足的困难，保证了和增加了生产。但是最近期间，有的企业却没有及时修订已经落后了的增产节约计划；有的企业对于增产节约计划却长期没有检查；还有许多企业几乎放松了对生产情况的研究，放松了推广先进经验和发动合理化建议的工作。各地党委、工会和各个经济部门对于这些现象应该予以严重的注意。
    目前第一个五年计划完成的期限只剩下最后几个月；第二个五年计划需要积极进行准备工作；同时各个企业正在进行或者准备进行整风和社会主义教育运动。这就要求领导部门进行合理安排，保证整风运动和社会主义教育运动胜利进行，同时又能继续开展增产节约运动，使我们能够圆满地完成第一个五年计划，并为第二个五年计划作好准备。
    继续开展增产节约运动的首要关键，是要解决干部的思想问题。有些人认为上半年增产节约运动开展得比较好，国家计划完成的情况也还不错，因而觉得问题不大，可以松一口气。这种想法显然是不对的。这是对实际工作所做的片面估计。上半年增产节约运动开展得比较好，国家计划完成的情况也比较好，这些都是事实。但是，这并不等于说上半年的工作就没有问题。上半年，某些产品质量下降，有些单位人身事故和设备事故增加，就是增产节约运动中需要严重注意的问题。至于从基本建设方面来说，计划完成得并不够好。而且有些问题，看来已经在上半年解决了，实际上却非短期的努力所能奏效。例如原材料不足的困难，上半年是解决了一些，缓和了一些，但对于我们这样一个人口众多，经济基础落后的国家说来，某些建设物资的供不应求，将不是一个短时期的现象。增产原材料和节约原材料也是长期的任务。要从根本上克服这方面的困难还需要不断的努力。质量、安全、原材料等等，都是工业方面重大的问题。这些问题还没有完全解决，怎么能说“问题不大”“可以松一口气”呢？
    有些人认为今年工业生产的困难很多，上半年取得这么大的成绩已经很不容易了，下半年再要增产、再要节约，那就困难了。这种想法也是没有根据的。“天上的星星数不完，生产的潜力挖不尽”，这是工人中流行的谚语，是很有道理的。最近，许多企业修订下半年的增产节约计划，就发现潜力还很大。比如，天津市的国营工业、交通部门原订今年增产节约七千五百万元，在上半年已完成三分之二，最近他们修订了计划，争取全年增产节约一亿元，即比原计划提高了三分之一。鞍钢炼铁厂决定下半年多增产一万二千吨铁，多节约一百万元。哈尔滨煤炭工业管理局所属六个矿务局也决定下半年为国家增产煤炭六十七万吨，这个数字比年初制订的全年的增产计划提高了将近一倍。我们怎么能够无视这些生产中的潜力而松懈自满呢？
    正确地认识和处理增产节约运动同整风运动和社会主义教育运动的关系，对于继续深入开展增产节约运动，是十分重要的。企业的整风运动和社会主义教育运动开展以后，广大职工的注意力被吸引到这方面去，这是必然的、正常的现象。我们应该组织广大职工积极参加这场重大的政治上和思想上的斗争。这是资本主义和社会主义两条道路的斗争。广大职工群众将从这次斗争中，受到一次生动的社会主义教育。整风运动和反右派斗争同增产节约运动是完全可以结合起来的。整风运动反对主观主义、宗派主义和官僚主义，检查“勤俭建国”的方针的贯彻情况，这些不但不会影响增产节约运动，而且对增产节约运动有莫大的推动作用。许多企业开展社会主义教育运动之后，帮助群众划清了社会主义思想同资本主义思想的界限，大大提高了职工群众的阶级觉悟，增长了辨别是非的能力，对于正确处理国家利益和个人利益、长远利益和眼前利益的关系，有了更高的自觉性，因而邪气下降、正气上升，在生产中进一步发挥了积极性和创造性。由此可见，整风运动和社会主义教育运动同增产节约运动完全可以结合起来进行。当然，由于同时进行几方面的工作，领导的精力会有一些分散，时间的分配会有一些矛盾，这就需要很好地安排一下。只要我们对这几方面的工作都进行了合理的安排，就能保证整风运动和社会主义教育运动胜利开展，又不致于偏废了增产节约运动。
    扭转增产节约运动的松劲现象，还需要大力加强运动的组织工作。在这方面，应该做的事情很多。我们在这里提出几点意见。
    第一，要总结和推广先进经验，继续开展先进生产者运动。这是开展增产节约运动的重要环节。有些人认为我们这里没有增产任务，不需要推广先进经验，这是不对的。先进经验是多方面的，每一个企业都应该根据任务的不同，生产关键的不同，来推广不同方面的先进经验。放弃了总结和推广先进经验，增产节约运动就不会收到应有的成效。
    第二，要发动合理化建议，开好生产会议。这是集中群众智慧、解决生产关键的好办法。过去许多企业都有专门机构处理合理化建议，现在有些企业取消了这种专门机构，使得合理化建议处于无人负责的状况。我们认为这种合理化建议无人负责的现象必须立即改变。领导人员要不断地指出生产关键，提出课题，发动群众提出合理化建议，来解决这些生产关键问题。
    第三，要及时评比竞赛的成绩，对先进生产者进行奖励。在评比方面，过去大都是一月一评，太费时间，评比的内容也过于繁琐，不利于真正通过评比来总结经验。后来改为一季一评，可是实际上有些企业连一季一评也没有做到。在奖励方面，过去有些企业奖励的面过宽，五花八门，花样繁多，失去了奖励的实际作用。然而，在反对这种不合理现象的时候，有些企业却干脆取消了奖励。我们认为怎样评奖可以研究一些适当的办法，但必须有评比，有奖励。
    第四，要对这一时期增产节约计划完成的情况，进行认真的检查。通过这个检查才好总结经验，发现缺点，明确方向，并且在这个基础上发动群众修订增产节约计划，以便在整风运动和社会主义教育运动中继续深入开展增产节约运动，用增加生产、厉行节约的巨大成果来反击资产阶级右派分子的进攻。
