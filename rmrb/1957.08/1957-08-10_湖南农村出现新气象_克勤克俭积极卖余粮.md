Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 9th - After Hunan Province launched a socialist propaganda and education movement centered on the grain issue in rural areas, a new atmosphere of increased production, frugality, and active sale of surplus grain by farmers has begun to emerge. In late July, the average daily grain intake into storage across the province was three million jin. By early August, it had increased to more than five million jin and is still increasing.

This year, Hunan Province had a bumper harvest of early rice. However, due to the rise of spontaneous capitalist forces in the countryside, some people took advantage of the drought and the new grain harvest to engage in black market speculation. Some farmers have individualistic ideas that only care about themselves and not the country. They not only do not actively sell surplus grain to the state but also conceal production, seize early rice, distill alcohol, and make sugar, while also claiming that there is not enough grain to eat. Some rural cadres have vague ideological understanding and do not refute or stop some remarks and actions that undermine the state's grain policy, even unilaterally requesting higher authorities to reduce grain purchase tasks.

After the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China discovered this situation, it launched a socialist propaganda and education campaign in rural areas throughout the province starting in late July. On the one hand, it conducted political and ideological education for cadres and farmers through local real people and events, using methods such as recollection and comparison, accounting and reasoning, and criticism and praise. On the other hand, it resolutely fought back against illegal elements engaged in speculation and undermining the state's grain policy. Farmers in various places used many vivid facts in the discussion of grain issues to conduct self-education. For example, farmers in the Dongting Lake area recalled that when the dike broke during the 1948 flood, the price of rice soared from 4 million to 30 million pseudo-currency per dan. In 1954, after suffering from floods, the People's Government compensated and transferred a large amount of grain from remote mountainous areas to provide relief, and grain prices remained stable. Farmers realized that if the policy of unified purchase and sale was not implemented and the grain was not in the hands of the state, then, like in 1954, after a flood, it is unknown how many people would be ruined.

Because the political consciousness of cadres and farmers was raised in the discussion, some cadres took the initiative to examine their erroneous ideas, and many farmers exposed the remarks and actions of illegal landlords, rich peasants, and bad elements who incited trouble. Now, in rural Hunan Province, the phenomenon of wasting grain after a bumper harvest has decreased, and a trend of diligence, frugality, and economical use of grain has initially formed. Farmers in various places are busy sending grain to storage and taking advantage of the rain to rush to plant late rice and autumn miscellaneous grains and fodder crops, striving for a comprehensive bumper harvest of mid-season rice, late rice, and miscellaneous grains.

### 湖南农村出现新气象  克勤克俭积极卖余粮

    湖南农村出现新气象
    克勤克俭积极卖余粮
    新华社长沙9日电　湖南省农村中开展以粮食问题为中心的社会主义宣传教育运动后，开始出现农民增产节约和积极出卖余粮的新气象。7月下旬，全省平均每天入库的粮食是三百万斤，到8月初已增加到五百多万斤，而且还在不断增加。
    今年，湖南省早稻丰收。但是，由于农村资本主义自发势力抬头，有些人趁天旱和新谷登场之际，进行黑市投机活动。农民中有一些人存在着只顾自己不顾国家的个人主义思想，不但不积极出售余粮给国家，反而隐瞒产量，抢分早稻，蒸酒熬糖，还嚷着粮食不够吃。有些农村干部思想认识模糊，对一些破坏国家粮食政策的言行也不加驳斥和制止，甚至片面要求上级核减粮食征购任务。
    中共湖南省委员会发现这种情况后，7月下旬起在全省农村中开展了社会主义宣传教育运动。一面通过当地真人真事，用回忆对比、算账说理和批评表扬等方法，对干部和农民进行政治思想教育。一面对投机倒把破坏国家粮食政策的不法分子坚决予以回击。各地农民在粮食问题的讨论中，举出了许多生动事实，进行了自我教育。如洞庭湖区农民回忆1948年水灾溃垸时，米价从伪币四百万元飞涨到三千万元一担；1954年遭受水灾，人民政府赔钱从遥远的山区调运大批粮食来供应救济，粮价平稳如常。农民们认识到，如果不实行统购统销政策把粮食掌握在国家手里，像1954年那样遇到水灾后，就不知道要有多少人弄得家破人亡。
    由于干部和农民在讨论中政治觉悟提高，有些干部主动检讨了自己的错误思想，不少农民揭发了不法地主、富农和坏分子煽动闹事的言行。现在湖南省的农村中，丰收后浪费粮食的现象减少了，勤俭持家节约用粮的风气已经初步形成。各地农民正一面忙着送粮入库，一面趁雨后抢种晚稻和秋季杂粮、饲料作物，争取中稻、晚稻、杂粮全面丰收。
