Another Important Measure by the State Regarding Overseas Chinese Affairs

Recently, the State Council promulgated the "Measures for Overseas Chinese to Donate Funds for Running Schools" and the "Preferential Measures for Overseas Chinese Investing in State-Owned Overseas Chinese Investment Companies" by order. This is another important measure by the state regarding overseas Chinese affairs, which will undoubtedly greatly inspire the vast number of Overseas Chinese.

Overseas Chinese, far away from their motherland, residing abroad, love their motherland and their hometowns, and they place great hopes on the independence and prosperity of their motherland. At the same time, it is also their common wish to establish long-term and profound friendships with the people of their countries of residence and to promote friendly unity with the local people. Most of the Overseas Chinese abroad never forget their motherland and still preserve their motherland's language, writing, customs, and habits; however, they have lived locally for several generations, and many have intermarried with the people of their place of residence. In terms of production activities and economic and cultural life, they have become one with the local people. They generally hope to acquire the nationality of their country of residence and become local people. In fact, many Overseas Chinese have long possessed the nationality of their country of residence. During the Asian-African Conference in 1955, our government signed a treaty with the Government of the Republic of Indonesia on resolving the issue of dual nationality of Overseas Chinese, and it stated that this treaty was a model for resolving the issue of dual nationality of Overseas Chinese. Our government has also expressed its willingness to resolve this historical issue of dual nationality of Overseas Chinese through diplomatic negotiations with relevant countries. In 1956, Premier Zhou Enlai and the former Chief Minister of Singapore, Marshall, issued a statement on resolving the issue of dual nationality of Overseas Chinese in Singapore, and similar statements were also issued in Burma and Cambodia. These measures, embodying the spirit of our country's peaceful diplomatic policy and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, aim to improve friendly relations with friendly countries in Southeast Asia on the issue of Overseas Chinese. Therefore, it is beneficial to the independent national countries of Southeast Asia, and it is also beneficial to the vast number of Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia.

Regarding the policy of resolving the dual nationality of Overseas Chinese, we advocate that Overseas Chinese, based on the principle of voluntariness, choose the nationality of their country of residence or retain Chinese nationality; we of course welcome those who wish to retain our nationality; we also welcome those who wish and are able to join the nationality of their country of residence. Those who have joined the nationality of their country of residence no longer have Chinese nationality; and since they regard their country of residence as their own country, they should be loyal to the country they have chosen and actively participate in the construction of their country of residence. Overseas Chinese who retain our nationality should also respect the policies and laws of their country of residence, abide by local laws, promote friendly relations with the people and government of their country of residence, engage in and assist economic and cultural undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood of the local country, and strengthen the patriotic unity of Overseas Chinese themselves. This is the basic policy that our government has repeatedly announced, and it is sufficient to prove our government's sincerity in implementing the Five Principles and its concern and care for Overseas Chinese abroad.

The vast majority of Overseas Chinese are familiar with the language and writing of the people of their country of residence and are willing to accept the culture and education of their country of residence. This is understandable and should be done. However, at the same time, among Overseas Chinese and local Chinese descendants, there is also the issue of maintaining the Chinese national language and writing tradition and maintaining Chinese education. Therefore, overseas Chinese schools should educate Overseas Chinese children to be familiar with the local language, writing, history, and geography, respect the culture of the country where they are located, and at the same time, retain a certain amount of necessary Chinese courses. This is beneficial to communication between national cultures, enhancing mutual friendship, and promoting the prosperity of the culture of the country where they are located. The task of Chinese education should serve this policy and should move in this direction. We are pleased to see that many governments of countries of residence respect Overseas Chinese for maintaining Chinese education. This is a friendly policy and is welcomed by us. If some governments of countries of residence still have doubts about Chinese education, we hope that these doubts can be eliminated through the efforts of both parties.

There are also tens of millions of family members of Overseas Chinese in China. Since the liberation of the motherland, some children of Overseas Chinese are willing to return to the motherland to study, and the number of children of Overseas Chinese dependents who request to enroll in schools is also considerable. Therefore, in addition to running schools that educate Chinese in the local area, many Overseas Chinese have always actively donated funds to run educational undertakings in China because some of their relatives are still in China. This spirit of patriotism and love for their hometowns among Overseas Chinese abroad is worth encouraging. They have always had a good tradition of donating funds to run schools in China. For example, Xiamen University and Jimei School were founded by Mr. Chen Jiageng with donated funds. In recent years, due to the encouragement and support of the government, the enthusiasm of Overseas Chinese abroad to donate funds to return to China to run schools has increased even more. Not only have the primary and secondary schools run by Overseas Chinese in their hometowns been restored, but they have also greatly developed. For example, there are already 67 secondary schools run by Overseas Chinese in Fujian Province. Under the care and help of party committees and governments at all levels, the leadership of Overseas Chinese schools has been gradually strengthened, the teaching staff and equipment have been gradually enriched, and the quality of teaching has improved. This has played a certain role in solving the problem of schooling for children of Overseas Chinese who have returned to China and children of Overseas Chinese dependents, developing cultural and educational undertakings in Overseas Chinese hometowns, and cultivating laborers with culture for the socialist construction of the motherland. At the same time, it has also helped promote the work of patriotic unity among Overseas Chinese abroad. In the future, people's committees at all levels in relevant areas should conscientiously implement the provisions of the "Measures for Overseas Chinese to Donate Funds for Running Schools" promulgated by the State Council, attach importance to the work of Overseas Chinese returning to China to donate funds for running schools, actively encourage and support them, and proactively assist them in solving difficulties. Article 4 of the "Measures for Overseas Chinese to Donate Funds for Running Schools" stipulates: "Overseas Chinese schools should implement the state's education policies and laws in the same way as public schools, and accept the leadership of the competent administrative departments of education," which is very important. Overseas Chinese schools are part of the state's school education undertaking and should obey the state's overall education plan, implement the state's overall education policy, be led by people's committees at all levels, and cultivate a new generation of working people with socialist consciousness and cultural level for the country. In the past, some places did not have a sufficient understanding of the nature and role of Overseas Chinese schools, did not pay enough attention to the leadership of Overseas Chinese schools, did not help solve the difficulties that Overseas Chinese schools faced, and some even thought that Overseas Chinese schools belonged to the nature of private enterprises and arbitrarily took over or changed the names of schools. These practices were completely unnecessary and should be corrected. In the future, people's committees at all levels should not arbitrarily take over Overseas Chinese schools or change their names without the consent of the founders of Overseas Chinese schools. All schools that have been taken over should be changed to be run by Overseas Chinese as long as Overseas Chinese abroad continue to support the regular expenses, and those that have changed their names should be restored. The education work of Overseas Chinese schools should be included in the local education undertaking plan, leadership should be strengthened, and they should be treated equally, so that the teaching quality of Overseas Chinese schools can be continuously improved. In order to enable Overseas Chinese students who have returned to China and children of Overseas Chinese dependents to obtain more schooling opportunities, Overseas Chinese schools should give priority to admitting Overseas Chinese students who have returned to China and children of Overseas Chinese dependents. In order to closely link Overseas Chinese schools with the people in the area where they are located and to obtain the support of the local people, children of non-Overseas Chinese dependents should also be enrolled in an appropriate proportion.

Secondly, there is the issue of Overseas Chinese economy and investment in China. The Overseas Chinese economy is one of the constituent parts of the social economy of the country of residence, and it has always served the economic construction of the place of residence. In the past, due to colonial rule, industry in Southeast Asia could not develop, and Overseas Chinese funds had to flow more into commerce. Now that Southeast Asian countries have become independent one after another, the situation has changed. Due to the needs of the people and governments of their countries of residence, Overseas Chinese in various places are increasingly transferring funds to the construction undertakings of their countries of residence, especially the transfer of Overseas Chinese commercial funds to the industrial sector. This has further promoted mutual cooperation and friendship with the people of their countries of residence. Overseas Chinese abroad actively participate in the economic construction of their countries of residence, which is also an increase in the strength of the Bandung spirit from the economic aspect. This is of course beneficial to the country where they are located, and it is also beneficial to enhancing the friendship between the motherland and these countries of residence and to the long-term interests of the Overseas Chinese. This is an encouraging trend, and the people of the motherland warmly support it.

Since liberation, with the development of socialist construction and various production undertakings in our country, in addition to participating in local economic undertakings in their countries of residence, the enthusiasm of some Overseas Chinese to return to China to invest has also increased, which is understandable. Between 1950 and 1951, Guangdong Province established a joint state-private Overseas Chinese Industrial Construction Joint Stock Company to solve the outlet for Overseas Chinese funds and to use Overseas Chinese funds in a planned way to develop local construction undertakings. After the publication of the general line of the state during the transition period, in order to further give play to the patriotism and love for their hometowns of Overseas Chinese and to strengthen the unified leadership of Overseas Chinese investment policies, so that Overseas Chinese investment could be better incorporated into local construction plans, the people's committees of Guangdong and Fujian provinces adopted active measures to guide Overseas Chinese to return to China to invest, thereby promoting the development of Overseas Chinese investment companies in recent years, establishing 44 factories, farms, and transportation enterprises of various sizes; in addition, several new factories are being planned. Recently, Guangxi, Shanghai, Yunnan, Wenzhou, and other places are also planning to establish investment companies.

In 1956, after our country achieved a basic victory in the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in terms of changing the ownership system, Overseas Chinese industrial and commercial enterprises in Southeast Asian countries, although they participated in the economic construction of their countries of residence, some Overseas Chinese urgently requested arrangements for their funds invested in China in order to take care of the lives and education of their families and children in China, and the elderly wanted to return to China for retirement. In accordance with the spirit of the Constitution of taking care of the legitimate interests of Overseas Chinese, our government has formulated the "Preferential Measures for Overseas Chinese Investing in State-Owned Overseas Chinese Investment Companies," affirming that Overseas Chinese investment companies are state-run Overseas Chinese capital trust enterprises, and these Overseas Chinese investment funds are controlled and allocated by the state. The enterprises invested in are directly managed by the state. The means of production are not controlled or owned by individuals, and the dividends are determined by the state. Therefore, this type of state-owned investment company belongs to a socialist nature. These measures provide appropriate regulations for a series of issues regarding Overseas Chinese and Hong Kong and Macao compatriots investing in state-run Overseas Chinese investment companies, such as funds, dividends, and employment requirements of investors, including allowing up to 50% of the annual interest income to be remitted back to foreign countries for family expenses after approval by relevant parties. This type of socialist state-owned investment company is the basic direction for encouraging Overseas Chinese to return to China to invest. However, at the same time, in order to take care of the special circumstances of Overseas Chinese abroad, the state does not exclude Overseas Chinese from returning to China to invest in individual operations, such as opening farms, or operating certain enterprises according to national needs after approval. Although the state does not exclude this situation, we believe that Overseas Chinese abroad will see clearly that investing in state-run Overseas Chinese investment companies will be more beneficial.

### 国家对华侨事务的又一重要措施

    国家对华侨事务的又一重要措施
    最近国务院以命令公布了“华侨捐资兴办学校办法”和“华侨投资于国营华侨投资公司的优待办法”。这是国家对华侨事务的又一重要措施，无疑地，它将给广大华侨以极大的鼓舞。
    华侨远离祖国，侨居国外，热爱祖国，热爱家乡，他们对于祖国的独立和富强寄托极大的希望。但是同时，华侨和侨居国人民建立了长期的深厚友谊，促进同当地人民的友好团结，也是他们的共同愿望。国外华侨大部分对祖国念念不忘，到现在还保存着祖国的语言文字和风俗习惯；但是，他们已数代在当地居留，不少人和侨居地人民通婚，在生产活动和经济文化生活方面已同当地人民打成一片。他们一般都希望取得侨居国国籍，成为当地人民。事实上，很多侨胞早就具有了侨居国国籍。我国政府在1955年亚非会议期间和印度尼西亚共和国政府签订了关于解决华侨双重国籍问题的条约，并且说明过这一条约是解决华侨双重国籍问题的范例。我国政府还表示愿意同各有关国家经过外交谈判解决这个从历史上遗留下来的华侨双重国籍的问题。1956年周恩来总理和新加坡前首席部长马歇尔发表了关于解决新加坡华侨双重国籍问题的谈话，在缅甸和柬埔寨也发表了相类似的谈话。这些措施，贯彻着我国和平外交政策与和平共处五项原则的精神，目的是从华侨问题上改进同东南亚各友邦的友好关系。因此，对于东南亚各民族独立国家是有利的，对于东南亚广大侨胞也是有利的。
    关于解决华侨双重国籍的方针，我们主张华侨根据自愿原则，选择侨居国国籍或者保留中国国籍；对于愿意保留我国国籍的，我们当然表示欢迎；对于愿意和能够参加侨居国国籍的人，我们也欢迎他们这样做。参加了侨居国国籍的人，就不再具有中国国籍；而且他们既然以侨居国为自己的国家，就应当效忠他们所选择的国家，积极地参加所在国的建设事业。保留我国国籍的侨胞，也应当尊重侨居国的政策法令，遵守当地法律，促进同侨居国人民和政府的友好关系，从事和协助有利于当地国计民生的经济文化事业，并且加强华侨本身的爱国团结。这就是我国政府反复宣布了的基本政策，也就足以证明我国政府贯彻执行五项原则的诚意，和对于国外侨胞的关怀和爱护。
    华侨的绝大部分熟谙侨居国人民的语言文字，愿意接受侨居国的文化教育，这是可以理解的，并且也是应当的。可是同时，在华侨和当地华裔人民中也存在着保持中国民族语言文字传统和保持华文教育的问题。因此，国外的华侨学校应当教育华侨子女熟悉当地的语言文字、历史和地理，尊重所在国的文化，同时，保留一定时间的必需的华文课程。这对于沟通民族文化交流，增进彼此友谊，繁荣所在国的文化是有利的。华文教育的任务应该为这一方针服务，并且应当朝着这一方向去做。我们高兴地看到，不少侨居国政府尊重华侨保持华文教育，这是友好的方针，是我们所欢迎的。如果某些侨居国政府对华文教育还存在着疑虑，我们希望经过有关双方的努力能够消除这种疑虑。
    国外华侨还有成千万的眷属在国内。祖国解放以后，一部分华侨的子女愿意回到祖国就学，侨眷子弟要求入学的数目也是不少的。因此，不少侨胞除在当地兴办教育华文的学校之外，由于他们的一部分亲人还在国内，一向也积极地在国内捐资兴办教育事业。国外侨胞的这种爱国爱乡的精神是值得鼓励的。他们向来有在国内捐资兴办学校的优良传统。如厦门大学、集美学校，就是陈嘉庚先生捐资创办的。近年来，由于政府的鼓励和支持，国外华侨捐资回国兴办学校的积极性更加提高了。华侨家乡的侨办中小学校不但已经恢复，而且有了很大的发展。例如福建省全省侨办中等学校已达六十七所。在各级党委和政府的关怀和帮助下，侨校领导逐渐加强，师资和设备逐渐充实，教学质量有了提高，这在解决回国华侨子女和侨眷子女就学、发展侨乡文化教育事业和为祖国培养有文化的社会主义建设的劳动者方面，都起了一定的作用，同时对促进国外侨胞的爱国团结工作，也有了帮助。今后有关地区的各级人民委员会应当认真地贯彻国务院颁布的华侨捐资兴办学校办法中的规定，重视华侨回国捐资兴学的工作，积极地予以鼓励和支持，并且主动地协助他们解决困难。“华侨捐资兴办学校办法”第四条规定：“侨校应该与公立学校同样贯彻执行国家的教育政策、法令，并且接受主管教育行政部门的领导”，这是非常重要的。侨校是国家学校教育事业的一部分，应当服从国家总的教育计划，执行国家总的教育方针，受各级人民委员会的领导，为国家培养有社会主义觉悟和文化程度的劳动人民的新的一代。过去有些地方由于对侨校性质和作用认识不足，对侨校领导重视不够，对侨校存在的困难帮助解决不够，有的甚至以为侨校属于私人企业的性质，而任意加以接管或更改校名，这些做法是完全没有必要的，应当予以纠正。今后各级人民委员会未经侨校创办人同意，不应当任意接管侨校或更改校名。凡已经接管的学校，只要国外华侨继续支持经常费用，仍应当改由侨办，其中已经更改校名的，要予以恢复。应当将侨校教育工作，纳入地方教育事业规划之内，加强领导，一视同仁，使侨校的教学质量不断提高。为了使归国华侨学生和侨眷子女能够得到更多的就学机会，侨校对归国华侨学生和侨眷子女入学应当予以优先录取。为了密切侨校与所在地区人民的联系和取得当地人民的支持，对非侨眷的子女也应当按适当比例招收。
    其次是关于华侨的经济和回国投资问题。华侨经济是侨居国社会经济构成部分之一，历来是为侨居地经济建设服务的。过去由于殖民主义统治，东南亚工业无法发展，华侨的资金不得不较多地流入商业。现在东南亚各国先后走向独立，情况发生了变化。由于侨居地人民和政府的需要，各地侨胞也愈来愈多地将资金转移于侨居地的建设事业，特别是把华侨商业资金开始转向工业方面，这就更加促进了同侨居地人民的互相合作和友谊。国外华侨积极地参加所在国的经济建设，也就是从经济方面增进了万隆精神的团结力量，这对所在国固然有利，并且对增进祖国和这些侨居国的友谊以及对华侨的长远利益也是有利的。这是一个值得鼓舞的趋向，祖国人民是热烈支持的。
    解放以来，随着我国社会主义建设和各项生产事业的发展，侨胞中除了在侨居国参加当地的经济事业以外，一部分侨胞回国投资的热情也提高了，这是可以理解的。1950—1951年间，广东省成立了公私合营的华侨工业建设股分有限公司，解决华侨资金的出路，并且有计划地运用侨资发展地方建设事业。过渡时期国家总路线公布以后，为了进一步发挥华侨爱国爱乡的热情，并且加强华侨投资政策的统一领导，使华侨投资更好地纳入地方建设计划，广东、福建两省人民委员会又采取了辅导华侨回国投资的积极措施，从而促进了几年来华侨投资公司业务的发展，建立了四十四个大小工厂、农场以及交通运输等企业；此外，还有几个新的工厂正在筹建中。最近，广西、上海、云南、温州等地也正在筹设投资公司。
    1956年，我国对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造在改变所有制方面取得了基本胜利以后，在东南亚各国的华侨工商业，虽然参加了侨居国的经济建设，可是由于部分侨胞为着照顾他们在国内的家庭儿女的生活和教育，年老的又想回国养老，因此，也就有一部分侨胞迫切地要求对他们回国投资的资金有所安排。我国政府根据宪法照顾华侨正当利益的精神，制定“华侨投资于国营华侨投资公司的优待办法”，肯定华侨投资公司系国家经营的侨资信托企业，这些华侨投资的资金是由国家掌握调配的，其投资的企业是由国家直接管理的，生产资料既不归个人掌握或者所有，股息又是由国家决定的，所以，这种国家投资公司属于社会主义性质。这一办法对华侨和港澳同胞投资于国家经营的华侨投资公司的一系列问题，如资金、股息、以及投资人就业要求等，都给予恰如其分的规定，其中包括容许把不超过50％的年息所得经过有关方面批准后，以外汇寄回国外作养家费用。这种社会主义性质的国家投资公司，是鼓励华侨回国投资的基本方向。可是同时，为了照顾国外华侨的特殊情况，国家并不排除华侨回国投资从事个人经营，如开办农场，或者在经过批准后根据国家需要经营某种企业。国家虽然并不排除这种情况，但是我们相信，国外华侨将会看清楚，投资于国家经营的华侨投资公司将是更加有利的。
