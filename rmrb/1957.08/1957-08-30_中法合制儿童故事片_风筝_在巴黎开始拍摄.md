The Sino-French co-production children's film "The Kite," jointly produced by China's Beijing Film Studio and France's Garance Films, began filming in Paris, France on July 30th. Wang Jia-yi, the Chinese director of the film, went to Paris as early as July 22nd. The filming work in Paris is proceeding quite smoothly and will soon be completed for the French scenes of the film. At that time, the French film crew and child actors, led by French director Roger Pigaut, will come to Beijing to continue filming the Chinese scenes of the film.
　　This is a film with friendship as its theme. The story takes place in Paris. An old tree has a Chinese kite hanging from it, with a lovable Sun Wukong painted on it. A group of French children are arguing over who gets the kite, and finally, a boy named Biro gets it. It turns out that there is also a letter attached to the tail of the kite, which they can't understand. Just as they are getting anxious, another child, Beber, suddenly snatches the tassel of the kite. Biro eagerly finds a Chinese antique shop and asks the owner to read the letter to them. The letter reads: "Whoever finds my kite, I am willing to be friends with them. Song Xiaoqing." Biro is very happy, but the address on the letter is snatched away by Beber! China is so big, where can they find him? He sits on the bed in a daze, looking at Sun Wukong on the kite and says: "Ah! People say you are powerful and omnipotent, but can you help me find my friend Song Xiaoqing in China?" Biro is extremely tired and closes his eyes. Suddenly, he sees Sun Wukong jump down from the kite, pluck a hair from his body, and blow on it to transform it into a beautiful lotus flower! Biro and his sister Nicole sit on the lotus flower and soar into the air, arriving in the China they have been longing for. With the help of many enthusiastic Chinese children, and after many adventures and difficulties, they finally find Song Xiaoqing.

　  中法合制儿童故事片“风筝”在巴黎开始拍摄
    我国北京电影制片厂和法国加朗斯电影制片公司合作摄制的彩色儿童故事片“风筝”，上月30日在法国巴黎开拍了。这部影片的中国导演王家乙早在上月22日就赴巴黎。在巴黎的摄制工作，进行得相当顺利，不日即可完成这部影片在法国的戏。届时，影片的法国摄制人员和儿童演员将由法国导演罗吉·比果率领来京，继续拍摄这部影片在中国的戏。
    这是一部以友谊为主题的影片。故事发生在巴黎。一棵古老的树上挂着一个中国式的风筝，风筝上画着讨人喜欢的孙悟空，一群法国孩子为了想得到这个风筝在争吵着，最后它被一个名叫比罗的孩子弄到了。原来，在风筝的尾巴上还带着一封信，他们看不懂，正在着急的时候，忽然另外一个孩子贝贝尔一把将风筝的穗子抢走了。……比罗急切地找到一家中国古玩店，请老板将信念给他们听，信写的是：“谁拾到了我的风筝，我愿意跟他做朋友。宋小青”。比罗听了很高兴，可是，信的地址被贝贝尔抢走了！中国那样大，到那儿去找呢？他坐在床上发呆望着风筝上的孙悟空说：“你呀！人家都说你神通广大，无所不能，可是你能帮助我到中国去找我的朋友宋小青吗？”比罗疲倦极了，合上了眼睛。突然，他看见孙悟空从风筝上跳下来，从身上拔下一根毫毛，用口一吹就变出了一朵美丽的莲花！比罗和他的妹妹尼高尔坐上了莲花，就腾空而起，来到了他们所向往的中国，经过许多热情的中国小朋友的帮助。经过很多的冒险和困难，才终于找到了宋小青。
