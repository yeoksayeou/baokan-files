Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 11th: Over the eight years since Shanghai's liberation, the number of hospital beds added is equivalent to 70% of the original bed capacity developed in the eighty-five years before liberation. The number of various outpatient facilities has increased 4.5 times.

Before liberation, the distribution of hospitals in Shanghai was very uneven, almost all concentrated in the urban area south of the Suzhou River, with very few hospitals in factory areas and suburbs. Now, the Shanghai Putuo Hospital, newly built in Caoyang New Village, has also been completed. All fifteen districts and three suburbs of Shanghai have hospitals, forming a complete medical network. Within factories and enterprises, there are also 662 healthcare facilities. The city's hospitals now have a total of 17,132 beds. From 1864, when the first hospital was established in Shanghai, until 1949, there were only 10,033 beds.

According to statistics from the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, more than 800,000 workers and 2 million family members of workers enjoy labor insurance medical benefits; more than 400,000 workers enjoy collective medical contract benefits; and more than 240,000 state organ personnel enjoy public medical benefits. They can all receive free or partially free medical care.

    一个完整的医疗网在上海市已经建成
    新华社上海11日电　上海解放后八年多来医院增加的床位，相当于解放前八十五年发展起来的原有床位的70％，各种门诊机构增加了四点五倍。
    解放以前，上海医院的分布很不平衡，几乎都集中在苏州河以南的市区范围内，工厂区和郊区很少有医院。而现在，新建在曹杨新村的上海市普陀医院也完工了，上海市十五个区和三个郊区都有了医院，构成了一个完整的医疗网。在工厂企业单位内，还设有六百六十二个保健机构。全市医院现在共有一万七千一百三十二张床位。而上海从1864年建立第一个医院到1949年为止，只有一万零三十三张床位。
    根据上海市卫生局的统计，目前全市有八十多万工人和两百万个工人家属享受着劳动保险的医疗待遇；有四十多万工人享受着集体医疗合同的待遇；还有二十四万多国家机关工作人员享受着公费医疗待遇。他们都可以得到免费或部分免费医疗的优待。
