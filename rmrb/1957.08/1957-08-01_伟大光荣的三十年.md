The liberator of 600 million Chinese people – the great and glorious Chinese People's Liberation Army celebrates its 30th anniversary! Over these thirty years, Chinese society has experienced earth-shaking and great transformations, moving from a democratic revolution to a socialist revolution. The realization of this great historical change is inseparable from the heroic struggles of the Chinese People's Liberation Army over the past thirty years. Today, our people, filled with excitement and gratitude, warmly celebrate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and pay our highest respects to the martyrs, disabled veterans, demobilized and transferred soldiers, and active-duty soldiers of the People's Liberation Army.

Due to special historical conditions, the Chinese people's revolution had to adopt the form of armed struggle from the very beginning. The revolutionary army has played a special and enormous role in the Chinese people's cause of liberation. Facts have proved that the Chinese People's Liberation Army is the basic pillar of the Chinese people's revolution and the cause of people's liberation. It is inconceivable that without the victory of the revolutionary war of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, how could the Chinese people have been liberated from the heavy oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, and how could we have the conditions to build our great motherland today!

Today, people should recall that thirty years ago, at the crucial moment when the Northern Expedition was moving forward, the Kuomintang reactionaries launched an anti-communist and anti-people coup, betraying their promises and slaughtering the Communist Party of China and the revolutionary people on a large scale, and white terror enveloped the whole country. At that time, many people thought that darkness would forever cover the light and that the revolution was hopeless. However, the Chinese Communists and the revolutionary people were determined not to yield. On this day thirty years ago, the Nanchang Uprising took place, followed by the Autumn Harvest Uprising, the Guangzhou Uprising, and uprisings in other regions. The Chinese Communists, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, raised the banner of revolution, established revolutionary armed forces and revolutionary base areas, and persistently upheld and developed the cause of the Chinese people's revolution. Over the past thirty years, relying on the revolutionary armed forces, the Chinese people finally defeated the powerful enemies at home and abroad and built the People's Republic of China.

Why has the Chinese People's Liberation Army been invincible? This is because it is an army of the people. It has a correct political line. Comrade Mao Zedong said in his political report at the Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China: "The reason why this army is powerful is that all the people who participate in this army have conscious discipline; they are not for the private interests of a few people or narrow groups, but for the interests of the broad masses of the people, for the interests of the entire nation, to unite and fight. Standing closely with the Chinese people and serving the Chinese people wholeheartedly is the only purpose of this army." Because of this, all officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army have a high degree of political consciousness. For the independence of the motherland and the liberation of the working people, they left their hometowns, not for fame or profit, but dedicated their youth and lives to the cause of the people's revolution. They are united with each other between officers and soldiers and between superiors and subordinates within the army; their relationship with the people outside the army is as close as family. Whether during wartime or in peacetime, they often participate in productive labor and do mass work. They have a great spirit of self-sacrifice and never boast to the people about their merits. The revolutionary spirit and glorious tradition of hard struggle and perseverance of the People's Liberation Army are forever worthy of praise. During the Second Revolutionary Civil War, they experienced the world-famous 25,000-li Long March; during the Anti-Japanese War, they overcame the enemy's division, blockade, and countless "mopping-up" and "encirclement" campaigns, overcame the enemy's "three-all policy," and defeated various difficulties through streamlining administration, reducing troops, and engaging in labor production, defeating Japanese imperialism; during the Third Revolutionary Civil War, they eliminated more than eight million troops of the Kuomintang reactionaries and liberated the mainland of our country. The Chinese People's Volunteers inherited and carried forward the fine traditions of the People's Liberation Army, fought side by side with the Korean People's Army, and defeated the American invading army equipped with modern equipment. During the period of peaceful construction of the motherland, the People's Liberation Army not only worked hard to consolidate national defense, but also actively supported industrial construction and the agricultural collectivization movement, and helped social reforms and various productions of ethnic minorities. People say: wherever there are difficulties, the People's Liberation Army goes there; wherever there is the People's Liberation Army, there is victory. This proves that the People's Liberation Army is truly an army of the people, and it will forever belong to the people.

Under the guidance of the correct political line, the People's Liberation Army has its correct military line. In each period of the revolution, it formulates correct strategies and tactics in accordance with the situation of the revolution at that time, analyzes changes in class relations, and based on the comparison of the strength of the enemy and ourselves. Over the past thirty years, the People's Liberation Army has fully learned how to coordinate military struggles with other various struggles. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Our Party has been able to coordinate the armed struggle, the main form of struggle, with many other necessary forms of struggle, directly or indirectly, that is to say, to coordinate the armed struggle with the struggle of the workers, the struggle of the peasants, the struggle of the youth, the women, and all the people, with the struggle for political power, with the struggle on the economic front, the struggle on the anti-espionage front, the struggle on the ideological front, and so on, throughout the country, either directly or indirectly." This military line has powerfully guaranteed the victory of the People's Liberation Army in various situations.

The army-building line of the People's Liberation Army is a fully democratic line. This is an inseparable part of our Party's mass line. Under the guidance of this line, the army has developed a fine democratic tradition. From the beginning of the army's establishment, the democratic style of the people's army has continued to develop, forming three major democracies: military, political, and economic. The so-called military democracy means that in combat and training, the troops advocate mutual help and mutual learning. Before and after battles, as long as the situation permits, "Zhuge Liang meetings" are held to think of ways, evaluate command, and evaluate combat; in training, evaluate teaching and learning. The so-called political democracy means that in certain situations, not only officers can criticize soldiers, but soldiers are also allowed to criticize officers; daily class meetings, platoon meetings, soldiers' meetings, soldiers' representative meetings, and other forms ensure that soldiers have the opportunity to express their opinions on work and life. A democratic inspection movement is also held every year. The so-called economic democracy means that soldiers can participate in the management of food. The content of these democratic lives greatly improves the enthusiasm of the soldiers, consolidates discipline, unites officers and soldiers, greatly enhances the prestige of officers, and the morale of the troops is always strong. This is actually the method of the mass line. Letting soldiers discuss plans such as combat, training, and work, accepting soldiers' good suggestions, and revising places where the leadership is not well considered is to concentrate the wisdom of the masses. At the same time, because the plan has been discussed by the masses, the masses can understand the content of the plan and improve their confidence and enthusiasm in implementing the plan. For army leaders, doing so has only advantages and no disadvantages. The People's Liberation Army relied on this method to overcome all difficulties in the most difficult times; in modern construction, this method continues to be implemented, making training work achieve excellent results. The People's Liberation Army's style of the mass line has set an example for the people of the whole country, infinitely enhancing our confidence in implementing the mass line. In the current rectification movement, we should universally promote the style of the mass line, fully trust the masses, and rely on the masses. If the People's Liberation Army can adhere to the mass line in various situations, then can't factories, rural areas, institutions, and schools do the same?

The most fundamental condition for the Chinese People's Liberation Army to have the correct political line, military line, and army-building line, to continuously develop and grow, and to continuously achieve victories is the leadership of the Communist Party of China. On all issues of the Chinese revolutionary war and national construction, the proletariat and the bourgeoisie have two completely different lines. Following the bourgeois line will inevitably ruin the revolution; only by adhering to the proletarian line can the revolution be led to victory. In the past thirty years in our country, without the leadership of the Communist Party, we could not build a people's army, we could not carry out the people's revolutionary war, we could not achieve the victory of the people's revolution, let alone the current socialist revolution. The historical facts have ironclad proof of this.

Now, the People's Liberation Army is a modern army with land, sea, air forces and various special forces. Our army equipment has been greatly innovated, and we not only have a powerful artillery, but also new arms such as armored forces, chemical forces, and engineering forces. The construction of the Air Force has achieved excellent results in a very short period of time. The Navy has also been built, and they will victoriously combine with other services to defend the motherland's coastal defense. In recent years, we have built many military schools, and the army's cadres have greatly improved in military, political, and cultural aspects. Various services and arms have carried out joint operations training on the basis of improving equipment, and have continued to implement the policy of the mass line in training, achieving excellent results. Hundreds of thousands of excellent shooters, technical experts, and countless activists have emerged in the troops. In a series of national defense projects, transportation roads, bases, etc., the People's Liberation Army has made tremendous efforts, which has rapidly enhanced our country's national defense.

On the 30th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army, we call on all officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army to continue to carry forward the fine traditions of the people's army, consolidate the internal and external unity of the army, improve discipline, and strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism and new military science and technology. Veteran cadres of the army, especially senior cadres, should pass on their experience well to the new generation of young people, improve their Marxist level, and be determined to be the servants of the people. Everyone should adhere to progress and never lag behind; adhere to a hard-working style and never pursue enjoyment. Everyone should always remember what Comrade Mao Zedong said in his opening speech at the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China: "Modesty makes people progress, and pride makes people lag behind." We hope that the hundreds of thousands of intellectuals who have joined the army in recent years will strive to strengthen the training of revolutionary struggle and socialist ideological education, learn from veteran cadres, and keep the glorious tradition of the People's Liberation Army forever. Millions of demobilized soldiers who have been transferred to various production posts should play an exemplary role in production and in all aspects of national life. The families of revolutionary soldiers and the families of martyrs should continue to maintain their glory. Everyone should work harder and strive for greater glory from all aspects with their exemplary actions.

The tasks facing the Chinese People's Liberation Army are arduous, glorious, and great. We must continue to work hard to defend peace, defend the security of the country, and defend the socialist cause of our people. Now Taiwan has not yet been liberated, and as long as the small remnant forces of the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek clique occupy Taiwan for one day, our struggle to liberate Taiwan cannot be relaxed for one day. We call on the people of the whole country and all officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army to strengthen our country's national defense by all means, consolidate the achievements of the socialist revolution, and be ready to liberate Taiwan at any time. If imperialism dares to launch a war of aggression, our military and civilians will also go all out to jointly shoulder the sacred task of defending the motherland. We must use all our efforts to consolidate the People's Liberation Army and support the People's Liberation Army. Let us shout: Long live the liberator of the Chinese people - the Chinese People's Liberation Army!

    伟大光荣的三十年
    六亿中国人民的解放者——伟大的光荣的中国人民解放军建军三十周年了。这三十年的中国社会，经历了从民主主义革命进到社会主义革命的翻天复地的伟大变革。这个伟大的历史变革之所以能够实现是同中国人民解放军三十年来的英勇奋斗分不开的。今天我国人民满怀兴奋和感激的心情，热烈地庆祝中国人民解放军建军的三十周年，并向解放军的烈士、残废军人、复员转业军人、现役军人致崇高的敬礼。
    由于特殊的历史条件，中国人民革命一开始就不能不采取武装斗争的形式。革命的军队在中国人民解放事业中起了特殊巨大的作用。事实证明，中国人民解放军是中国人民革命和人民解放事业的基本支柱。不能设想，如果没有中国人民解放军的革命战争的胜利，中国人民怎么能够从帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的重重压迫之下解放出来，怎么能够有今天这样的条件来建设我们伟大的祖国！
    今天，人们应该回忆一下，在三十年前，正当北伐战争向前发展的紧要关头，国民党反动派举行了反共反人民的政变，背信弃义地大肆屠杀中国共产党和革命的人民，白色恐怖笼罩了全国。那个时候，有许多人以为黑暗将永远遮住光明，以为革命没有希望了。可是，中国共产党人和革命的人民是决不屈服的。就在三十年前的今天，南昌起义了，接着是秋收起义、广州起义和其他地区的起义。以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党人，举起了革命的大旗，建立了革命的武装和革命的根据地，百折不回地坚持和发展了中国人民革命的事业。三十年来依靠着革命的武装力量，中国人民终于战胜了国内外强大的敌人，建设了中华人民共和国。
    为什么中国人民解放军能够无往而不胜呢？这就因为它是人民的军队。它有正确的政治路线。毛泽东同志在中国共产党第七次全国代表大会上的政治报告中说过：“这个军队之所以有力量，是因为所有参加这个军队的人，都具有自觉的纪律；他们不是为着少数人的或狭隘集团的私利，而是为着广大人民群众的利益，为着全民族的利益，而结合，而战斗的。紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务，就是这个军队的唯一的宗旨。”正因为这样，人民解放军的全体官兵，都有高度的政治觉悟，他们为祖国的独立，为劳动人民的解放，离开了家乡，不为名，不为利，把自己的青春和生命，献给人民革命事业。他们在军队内部官兵之间和上下级之间团结一致；在军队外部同人民群众的关系亲如家人。他们无论在战争期间或者在和平时期都经常参加生产劳动，做群众工作。他们具有伟大的自我牺牲精神，并且从来不以自己的功劳向人民夸耀。人民解放军艰苦奋斗、坚韧不拔的革命气概和光荣传统是永远值得歌颂的。第二次国内革命战争时期经历了举世闻名的二万五千里长征；抗日战争时期战胜了敌人的分割、封锁和无数次“扫荡”“合围”，战胜了敌人的“三光政策”，并且以精兵简政、劳动生产战胜了各种困难，打败了日本帝国主义；第三次国内革命战争时期消灭了国民党反动派的八百多万兵力，解放了我国大陆。人民志愿军继承和发扬了解放军的优良传统，同朝鲜人民军并肩战斗，打败了现代化装备的美国侵略军。在祖国和平建设时期，解放军不但努力巩固国防，并且积极支援了工业建设和农业合作化运动，帮助了少数民族的社会改革和各种生产。人们说：那里有困难，解放军就到那里；那里有解放军，那里就有胜利。这就证明，人民解放军真正是人民的军队，它将永远属于人民。
    在正确的政治路线指导之下，人民解放军有它正确的军事路线。它在革命的各个时期，按照当时革命发展的形势，分析阶级关系的变化，根据敌我力量的对比，制定正确的战略战术。三十年来，人民解放军完全学会了把军事斗争同其他各种斗争配合起来的方法。毛泽东同志说：“我们党已经能够把武装斗争这个主要斗争形式同其他许多的必要的斗争形式直接或间接地配合起来，就是说，把武装斗争同工人的斗争，同农民的斗争，同青年的、妇女的、一切人民的斗争，同政权的斗争，同经济战线上的斗争，锄奸战线上的斗争，思想战线上的斗争，等等斗争形式，在全国范围内或者直接地或者间接地配合起来。”这个军事路线在各种情况下都有力地保证了人民解放军的胜利。
    人民解放军的建军路线是充分的民主路线。这是我们党的群众路线的不可分割的部分。在这个路线指导下，军队养成了优良的民主传统。从建军初期开始，人民军队的民主作风不断发展，形成了军事上、政治上、经济上的三大民主。所谓军事民主，就是部队在作战和训练当中，提倡互相帮助，互相学习。在战斗的前后，只要情况许可，就开诸葛亮会，想办法，评指挥，评战斗；在训练中，评教评学。所谓政治民主，就是在一定的场合，不但军官可以批评士兵，也允许士兵批评军官；日常的班务会、排务会、军人大会、士兵代表会等形式，保证士兵对工作和生活都有发表意见的机会。每年还举行一次民主检查运动。所谓经济民主，就是士兵可以参加伙食的管理。这些民主生活的内容，使军队士兵的积极性大大提高，纪律巩固，官兵团结，军官的威信大大提高，部队士气始终旺盛。这实际上就是群众路线的办法。把作战、训练、工作等计划，让士兵讨论，接纳士兵好的建议，修改领导上考虑不周的地方，就是把群众的智慧集中起来。同时，因为计划经过了群众的讨论，群众就能够了解计划的内容，提高他们执行计划的信心和积极性。对军队领导者来说，这样做只有好处，没有坏处。人民解放军在最困难的时候，依靠这种方法，克服了一切困难；在现代化建设中，这个方法继续实行了，使训练工作取得了优良的成绩。人民解放军的这个群众路线的作风，给全国人民做出了榜样，无限地增强了我们实行群众路线的信心。在目前的整风运动中，我们应该普遍发扬群众路线的作风，充分地相信群众，依靠群众。如果说，人民解放军能够在各种情况下坚持群众路线，那末，工厂、农村、机关、学校难道不能这样做吗？
    中国人民解放军所以能够有正确的政治路线、军事路线和建军路线，不断地发展壮大，不断地取得胜利，它的最根本的条件是在于中国共产党的领导。在中国革命战争和国家建设的一切问题上，无产阶级和资产阶级都有截然不同的两条路线。照资产阶级的路线走去，那就必然断送了革命；只有坚持无产阶级的路线，才能把革命引向胜利。在我国过去的三十年间，如果没有共产党的领导，就不能建设人民的军队，就不能进行人民革命战争，就不能取得人民革命的胜利，更不要说现在的社会主义革命了。历史的事实已经铁一般地证明了这一点。
    现在，人民解放军已是具有陆、海、空军和各种特种兵的现代化军队了。我们的陆军装备大大革新了，我们不但有了强大的炮兵，并且有了装甲兵、化学兵、工程兵等新的兵种。空军的建设在很短的几年内已取得优良成绩。海军也建设起来了，他们将胜利地和其他军种结合，保卫祖国的海防。几年来，我们建设了许多军事学校，军队的干部在军事、政治、文化的各方面都有很大的提高，各军种和兵种在改善装备的基础上，进行了协同作战的训练，并且在训练中继续贯彻了群众路线的方针，取得了优良成就。部队中涌现了几十万的优等射手、技术能手和无数的积极分子。在一系列的国防工程、交通道路、基地等的建设中，人民解放军都付出了巨大的劳动，使我国的国防有了迅速的增强。
    在解放军建军三十周年的今天，我们号召人民解放军全体官兵，继续发扬人民军队的优良传统，巩固军队内部和外部的团结，提高纪律，加强对马克思列宁主义的学习和新的军事科学、军事技术的学习。军队的老干部，特别是高级干部，应当把自己的经验很好地传授给新的青年一代，提高他们的马克思主义水平，决心做人民的勤务员。大家要坚持进步、决不落后；坚持艰苦作风、决不追求享受。大家要永远记住毛泽东同志在党的第八次全国代表大会的开幕词中所说的话：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”。我们希望近几年来参加军队的几十万知识分子，努力加强革命斗争的锻炼和社会主义的思想教育，向老干部学习，把解放军的光荣传统永远保持下去。已经转业到各种生产岗位上的数百万复员军人，要在生产上和在国家生活的各方面起模范作用，革命军人的家属和烈士家属要继续保持光荣。人人都要更加努力，从各个方面用自己的模范行动争取更大的光荣。
    摆在中国人民解放军面前的任务是艰巨的、光荣的和伟大的。我们必须继续努力保卫和平，保卫国家的安全，保卫我国人民的社会主义事业。现在台湾还没有解放，国民党蒋介石集团的那一小撮残余势力一天盘据在台湾，我们解放台湾的斗争就一天不能松懈。我们号召全国人民和全体解放军官兵，要用一切方法加强我国的国防，巩固社会主义革命的成果，随时准备解放台湾。如果帝国主义敢于发动侵略战争，我国军民还将全力以赴，共同负担起保卫祖国的神圣任务。我们要用一切努力来巩固人民解放军，拥护人民解放军。让我们高呼：中国人民的解放者——中国人民解放军万岁！
