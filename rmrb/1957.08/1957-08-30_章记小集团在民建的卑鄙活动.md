　　The despicable activities of the Zhang Naiqi clique within the China Democratic National Construction Association
　　Qin Zebang
    Rightist Zhang Naiqi had always wanted to control the central organs of the China Democratic National Construction Association (CDNCA) in order to use it as a major base for anti-Communist and anti-socialist activities. The rightist clique cultivated by Zhang Naiqi within the CDNCA central organs was a tool to realize this reactionary political ambition.
      "Birds of a feather flock together." These fellows gathered by Zhang Naiqi, just like himself, were all consistently anti-Communist, historically complex, with unclear political backgrounds, and of vile character and style. These people usually hid in dark corners, cunningly concealing themselves; in the anti-Rightist struggle, once exposed to the sunlight, each of them was revealed for what they were. Their relationship with Zhang Naiqi was almost always that of long-standing confidants, former subordinates, or old friends, which further showed how serious their "collusion for personal gain" was.
    Zhang Naiqi put painstaking effort into cultivating this group of rightist elements. He boasted that they were "the few capable writers that the Ministry of Food could not find," openly "promised official positions," and tried his best to elevate their status, attempting to create a "reputation" among the cadres of the organization, so that they could attack the leadership. Rightist Lin Difei and Ding Yuchang, clearly holding the editorial power of the "Minxun" (the CDNCA central organ's publication), with "the power to accept or reject" articles, were still not enough for Zhang Naiqi, who insisted that they were "without position or power," doing "underground work," and must be "crowned" with three ranks; for another rightist, Xu Hanzan, he advocated bold promotion, taking care of his past qualifications as a reason, to let him grasp the overall propaganda and education work. What was Zhang Naiqi's so-called "qualification"? It turned out that he had served as a puppet county magistrate for several terms in the reactionary era. Under Zhang Naiqi's cultivation, these few rightist clique members became arrogant, acted perversely, and further seized the work positions of the propaganda and education departments and "Minxun." At the same time, Zhang Naiqi arranged for his wife, Yang Meizhen, and his personal accountant, Dai Jiaying, to control the general affairs and finances of the CDNCA Central Committee, creating disputes from the cadres' personal lives and doing everything possible to win over and attack others.
    Under Zhang Naiqi's instigation, this rightist clique stirred up trouble inside and outside the CDNCA central organs. In propaganda and education work, they spread the poisonous gas of Zhang Naiqi's reactionary remarks to the industrial and commercial circles, instigating industrialists and businessmen to resist transformation and the leadership of the working class; at the same time, within the organization, they won over some backward masses, used the dissatisfaction of some masses, provoked from the aspects of living welfare, dissatisfied with the current wages and status, clamoring that "things were better in the past" after liberation, demanding improved treatment, and also demanding "absolute democracy" and "absolute freedom," in order to attack the leadership and undermine the organization. On the other hand, under the guise of anti-sectarianism, they slandered Party members, League cadres, and progressive elements, in order to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Zhang Naiqi often said that he "obtained his position and power in the Ministry of Food through struggle," in order to incite democratic party cadres to struggle against the Party. Zhang Naiqi did not hesitate to reveal state secrets so that his rightist group members could show off their well-informedness among the cadres of the organization in order to raise their status.
    Zhang Naiqi's vicious and despicable behavior was also manifested in the fact that he often distorted the state's policies and guidelines, and distorted the speeches of state leaders, out of context, in order to confuse the backward masses. He shamelessly said: "I, Zhang, am a person who often attends the highest state meetings, and I have a deep understanding and experience of the major policies and guidelines of the Party and the state." According to the "private words" of Zhang Naiqi confessed by the rightist clique members in this struggle, it further exposed how rampant his anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks and actions had become.
    Zhang Naiqi stubbornly refused to carry out ideological transformation of the bourgeoisie, and he said to his rightist clique members in a contemptuous tone: "Today, we must think independently and not be shaken by the words of a certain big shot." He once said to his people: "Singing a counter-tune is to require the democratic parties to 'divide the court and resist,' and we must have the spirit of not being afraid of being said to be 'dividing the court and resisting' in order to truly implement mutual supervision." He also said, "Talking about mutual supervision and strengthening leadership at the same time is dependence thinking, and also canceling thinking." When talking about the relationship between the bourgeoisie and the working class, this rightist clique member said: "Zhang Naiqi often advocated that industrialists and businessmen must dare to fight against the working class in factories and stores." After the high tide of socialist transformation last year, the CDNCA Central Propaganda and Education Conference mentioned "obeying the leadership of the public side," and Zhang Naiqi immediately severely criticized such a statement as violating the policy, and instructed his rightist clique that in the future, they should emphasize criticizing the public representatives. He also said that he opposed the enterprise as the main base for transforming private personnel, but should be a base for mutual supervision, first of all, to supervise the Communist Party.
    Zhang Naiqi's private words were regarded as "golden rules" by his rightist clique. Whether it was propaganda and education work or the editorial work of "Minxun," any text that slightly sharply criticized the capitalists or emphasized the education and transformation of the capitalists was either discarded or arbitrarily deleted or softened in tone; and what they appreciated were the wonderful articles of Li Kangnian, Wu Jincui, and others.
    Zhang Naiqi and his rightist clique denigrated patriotic and law-abiding education as "restrictive rules and regulations"; and advocated developing organizations towards the middle and backward masses, so that the CDNCA could not cultivate the backbone elements of the industrial and commercial circles. All of this is sufficient to prove that the road taken by Zhang Naiqi and his rightist clique is the road of capitalist restoration and counter-revolutionary restoration.
    The anti-Rightist struggle in the CDNCA central organs is continuing to advance on the basis of preliminary victory. The conspiracy activities of Zhang Naiqi and his rightist clique will continue to be exposed and criticized until they are completely crushed.

　　章记小集团在民建的卑鄙活动
　　秦泽邦
    右派分子章乃器一直就想操纵民建中央机关，以便把它作为反共反社会主义活动的一个主要基地。章乃器在民建中央机关所培植的右派小集团，就是为了实现这个反动的政治野心的工具。
      “物以类聚”，章乃器所啸聚的这些家伙，也正如他自己一样，无一不是一贯反共，历史复杂，政治面貌不清，品质、作风恶劣的人。这些人平常躲在阴暗的角落里，狡猾地隐蔽着自己；在反右派斗争中，一经阳光的照射，就个个现形了。他们和章乃器的关系，差不多都是历史悠久的亲信、旧属、故交，这就更显得他们之间的“朋比为奸”是如何的严重了。
    章乃器对这般右派小集团分子的培植是费尽苦心的。他吹嘘他们是“粮食部找不到的几根笔杆子”，公开地“封官许愿”，极力抬高他们的身分地位，企图在机关干部中间造成“声誉”，便于他们打击领导。右派分子林涤非和丁裕长，明明是掌握着“取舍由之”的“民讯”（民建中央机关刊物）编辑大权，但章乃器还不以为足，硬要说他们是“无职无权”，干着“黑活”，一定要“加冠”三级；对于另一右派分子许汉三，则以照顾他的过去资历为理由，主张大胆提拔，要让他掌握全面的宣教工作。什么是章乃器的所谓“资历”呢？原来就是在反动时代当了几任伪县长。这几个右派小集团分子就在章乃器这样的培植之下，趾高气扬，倒行逆施，进一步占夺了宣教部门和“民讯”的工作阵地。同时，章乃器又布置了他的妻子杨美真和他的私人账房戴家瀛把持了民建中央的总务、财务，从干部的切身生活方面，制造纠纷，极尽拉拢、打击之能事。
    在章乃器的嗾使之下，这个右派小集团的分子就在民建中央机关内外兴风作浪。在宣教工作上，对工商界施放章乃器的反动言论的毒气，鼓动工商业者抗拒改造，抗拒工人阶级的领导；同时，在机关内部笼络一部分落后群众，利用一部分不满情绪的群众，从生活福利方面进行挑拨，不满当前的工资和地位，大叫解放以后“今不如昔”，要求改善待遇，又要求“绝对民主”、“绝对自由”，以打击领导，破坏组织。另一方面，则在反宗派主义的幌子之下，对党团员干部和进步分子进行污蔑，以图去之而后快。章乃器经常说，他“在粮食部的有职有权是斗争得来的”，以煽动民主党派干部对党进行斗争。章乃器还不惜泄露国家的机密，使他的右派集团分子能在机关干部中卖弄消息灵通，以抬高身价。
    章乃器的恶毒、卑劣的行为，还表现在他往往断章取义地歪曲国家的方针政策，歪曲国家领导人的言论，以迷惑落后群众。他无耻地说：“我章某人是经常参加国家最高会议的人，对党和国家重大方针政策的认识和体会是深切的”。根据右派小集团分子在这次斗争中所交代的章乃器的“私房话”，更加暴露了他的反党反社会主义言行是达到了怎样猖狂的地步。
    章乃器顽强地拒绝对资产阶级进行思想改造，他曾以轻蔑的口吻对他的右派小集团分子说：“今天就是要独立思考，不能为某一大人物的话所动摇”。他曾经对他们的人说：“唱对台戏，就是要求民主党派‘分庭抗礼’，要有不怕被人说是‘分庭抗礼’的精神，才能真正的实行相互监督”。又说“谈相互监督，又提加强领导，这是依赖思想，也是取消思想”。在谈到资产阶级和工人阶级的关系时，这个右派小集团的分子又说：“章乃器常主张工商业者在厂店中一定要敢于和工人阶级斗争”。在去年社会主义改造高潮以后，民建中央宣教会议曾提到“服从公方领导”，章乃器立即严厉批评这样的提法是所谓违背政策，并指示他的右派小集团，今后应强调批评公方代表。还说：他反对企业作为改造私方人员的主要基地，而应该是作为相互监督，首先是对共产党进行监督的基地。
    章乃器的私房话，被他的右派小集团奉为“金科玉律”。无论是宣教工作或“民讯”的编辑工作，凡是稍为尖锐批评资本家的文字或者是强调资本家教育改造的言论，不是加以弃置，便是随意删节或缓和其语气；而他们所欣赏的是李康年、吴金萃这一干人的妙文。
    章乃器及其右派小集团曾诋毁爱国守法教育为“清规戒律”；并主张向中间、落后群众发展组织，使民建会不能培养工商界的骨干分子。凡此一切，无一不足以证明章乃器及其右派小集团所走的道路是资本主义复辟、反革命复辟的道路。
    民建中央机关的反右派斗争，正在初步胜利的基础上继续前进。章乃器及其右派小集团的阴谋活动还将继续的揭露与批判，直至彻底被粉碎为止。
