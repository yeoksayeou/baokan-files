Wu Shaoshu Can't Slip Away No Matter How Cunning
Transportation Ministry Employees Refute This Rightist Element's Reactionary Words and Deeds

(Our Dispatch) All the employees of nine units, including the Counselor's Office of the Ministry of Transportation, are currently exposing and refuting the reactionary words and deeds of the rightist Wu Shaoshu (Deputy Director of the Counselor's Office of the Ministry of Transportation).

Wu Shaoshu is an alternate member of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), an old-brand secret agent, and a cunning and stubborn rightist element. In 1925, he joined the Communist Youth League but soon betrayed it. Before liberation, he was a notorious puppet deputy mayor of Shanghai, and the people hated him to the bone. They once summarized him in eight characters: "Extorted countless wealth, committed all kinds of evil." During the rectification campaign, he slandered our Party's cadre policy as a "personnel policy based solely on historical background." He scolded the Communist Party for "listening only to one side" and active elements as "vicious dogs guarding the door."

At the forum, everyone revealed his secretive relationship with rightists such as Huang Shaohong and Tan Tiwu. He knew very well about Tan Tiwu's anti-communist and anti-socialist fallacies before they were published, calling them "brilliant speeches." He also echoed Huang Shaohong, trying his best to deny the achievements of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. At the same time, he went to the Dongsi District in Beijing to incite members of the RCCK, instigating them to attack the Party.

Under the accusations of the masses, Wu Shaoshu admitted that he was a rightist element, but he refused to thoroughly confess his specific activities.

All the employees of the Ministry of Transportation deeply hate such an old, cunning, and stubborn rightist element and are determined to fight him to the end.

    吴绍澍再狡猾也滑不过去
    交通部职工驳斥这个右派分子的反动言行
    本报讯　交通部参事室等九个单位的全体职工正在揭露和驳斥右派分子吴绍澍（交通部参事室副主任）的反动言行。
    吴绍澍是民革的候补中央委员，是一个老牌特务、狡猾顽固的右派分子，在1925年他曾参加过共青团，不久叛变。解放前，他是一个臭名昭彰的上海市伪副市长，人民把他恨之入骨，曾经用八个字给他作了总结：“搜刮无数、作恶多端。”在整风期间，他诬蔑我们党的干部政策是“唯历史成份论的用人方针”。他骂共产党“偏听偏信”，骂积极分子是“恶狗看门”。
    在座谈会上大家揭发了他和黄绍竑、谭惕吾等右派分子之间的诡密关系。谭惕吾的反共反社会主义谬论，在没有见报前，他就知道得很清楚，说它是“精采发言”。他并和黄绍竑彼此呼应，竭力否定肃反的成绩。同时他还到北京东四区向民革的成员点火，煽动他们向党进攻。
    吴绍澍在群众的指责下承认自己是右派分子，而对于具体活动却不肯彻底交代。
    交通部的全体职工对这样一个老奸巨猾顽固的右派分子非常痛恨，决心要同他斗争到底。
