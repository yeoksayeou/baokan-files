　　As long as the ideology is correct, there will be enough rations
    Meng Guangzhen, a female member of the Gongjidian Village Agricultural Cooperative in Mafang Township, Tong County, Hebei Province, is an expert in saving food. Her family of five (three children, the oldest being twelve years old and the youngest still breastfeeding) retained a total of 1,530 jin of grain for the whole year according to the local grain retention standard (an average of 306 jin per person). A year has passed, and her family has not only not exceeded the grain retention standard, but has even saved 50 jin of grain.
    Many villagers in the village complain that "there is not enough food to eat," so why does Meng Guangzhen's family have a surplus of grain? Her husband, Zheng Youde, answered this question well: "Some people have the wrong ideas, thinking 'Now that we are in the cooperative, we can eat without worry, the cooperative will take care of the food.' How can you eat like that!" Indeed, as he said, some villagers are always afraid of being taken advantage of, asking the cooperative for grain when they run out and asking the cooperative for money when they have no money. However, Meng Guangzhen's family is not like that. After receiving their share of grain last year, they discussed ways to save grain. Her husband encouraged her, saying, "You are the one who cooks, you have to pay more attention to whether we have enough to eat." She thought that her husband was right, so she decided to eat coarser food in the future. From then on, she ground the grain coarser when using the millstone. She dried the good sweet potatoes of the 600 jin that the family was allocated into sweet potato slices and ground the bad ones into sweet potato flour, which she mixed with wheat flour to eat. Last summer, they collected a lot of wild vegetables, which were all dried and saved for winter to eat with meals. When spring came, new vegetables were available again. When it was not the busy farming season, they changed to eating two meals a day. Meng Guangzhen had a fixed amount of grain for each meal. She also trained her children to eat regularly at meals and not to eat snacks. When grinding, she swept the millstone clean. Not a single grain of food was left in the pots, bowls, and basins.
    After the wheat harvest this year, her family received a total of 350 jin of wheat. According to the supply standard, the whole family still lacked about 100 jin of grain in July, August, and September. However, due to careful saving and mixing in some melons and vegetables, by August 9th, they had only eaten just over 100 jin of the 300-plus jin of wheat. In this way, her family can eat wheat until the autumn harvest and does not need the state to supply grain.　Li Gui, Sun Minjun

### 只要思想对头，口粮就会够吃

　　只要思想对头，口粮就会够吃
    河北通县马坊乡供给店村农业社女社员孟广珍，是个节约粮食的能手。她全家五口人（三个小孩，最大的十二岁，最小的还吃奶）。去年根据当地留粮标准，她家全年共留粮一千五百三十斤（平均每人三百零六斤）。一年过去了，她家不但没有超出留粮标准，反而结余了五十斤粮食。
    村里有许多社员嚷“粮食不够吃”，为什么孟广珍一家粮食还有节余呢？她的丈夫郑有德在回答这个问题时说得好：“有的人思想不对头，认为‘入社了，放心吃吧，没有粮食社里管’，这怎么能够吃呢！”确实像他所说的，有的社员总怕自己吃亏，没有粮就到社里要，没有钱就到社里支。可是，孟广珍一家不是这样，他们在去年分得粮食后，就商量了节约粮食办法。她的丈夫勉励她说：“你是掌勺的（做饭），够吃不够吃你得多拿点主意。”她想，丈夫的话说得对，就决定今后要吃粗一点。从此，她在推磨拉碾的时候，把粮食碾得粗一些。全家分的六百斤红薯，她把好的晒成薯干，坏的磨成薯面，和面粉掺在一起吃。去年夏天，他们采了很多野菜，都晒成菜干，留在冬天搭着吃。等春天来了，新菜又下来了。不是农忙季节，改为一天吃二顿饭。每顿饭放多少粮食，孟广珍都有一定数量。她还养成了孩子们按顿吃饭的习惯，不吃零食。在推碾的时候，把碾盘扫干净。锅、碗、盆里都不剩一点粮食。
    今年麦收后，她家共分了三百五十斤麦子。按供应标准，在7、8、9三个月中，全家还缺粮一百斤左右。但由于注意节约，掺吃一些瓜菜，到8月9日止，三百多斤麦子才吃了一百多斤。这样，她家的小麦可以吃到大秋，不需要国家供应粮食。　李桂、孙民俊
