　　Reversing Weakness and Ineffectiveness, Strengthening Leadership Against the Rightists
　　Tianjin Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League Ousts Wang Dachuan
　　(Our Newspaper News) The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League was once weak and ineffective in the anti-Rightist struggle. Since late July, this situation has been reversed, the work of the leading group has been strengthened, and the anti-Rightist struggle has been deepened. Now, further exposure of the many reactionary acts of Wang Dachuan, the agent of the Zhang-Luo alliance in Tianjin and a rightist element, is underway, and Wang Dachuan's new tricks have been shattered.
　　According to the revealed materials, Wang Dachuan, taking advantage of the Communist Party's rectification campaign, instigated, supported, or instructed League members and rightist elements Wang Guiqiu and Li Peiying from the Tianjin Civil Architectural Design Institute, League members and rightist elements Li Baozhen and Chen Guoqing from Nankai University, League members and rightist elements Yang Sichen and Du Kai from Tianjin University, League members and rightist elements Li Limin from Hebei Tianjin Normal College, etc., to fabricate so-called fundamental shortcomings of the Party, in order to lower the Party's prestige and weaken the Party's leadership, so that these rightist elements could "come to power."
　　Wang Dachuan, through rightist elements Zheng Weishi in the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, League member and rightist element Li Changfu from Tianjin Railway Engineering School, League member and rightist element Han Boping from Tianjin Dredging Company, League member and rightist element Li Baozhen from Nankai University, etc., adopted despicable means such as promising official positions, treating to meals, giving gifts for solicitation, spreading rumors to lure and deceive, introducing romantic partners, etc., to specifically develop those who were dissatisfied with the Party and those who had been struggled against in previous movements to join the League. According to Wang Dachuan's admission, his purpose in doing so was to develop the League organization into an "opponent of the Party."
　　When Wang Dachuan's reactionary words and deeds were initially exposed in late June, Wang Dachuan immediately instructed his crony Zheng Weishi to shout "injustice" everywhere, saying that this was a "sectarian struggle" against Wang Dachuan by those who were close to the Party. After the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League deeply carried out the anti-Rightist struggle and further investigated many of Wang Dachuan's reactionary words and deeds, Wang Dachuan could not deny the ironclad facts and admitted to some of the above-mentioned reactionary words and deeds; but he then played new tricks under the cover of pretending to bow his head and admit his guilt. Those who were originally considered by him to be carrying out "sectarian struggle" against him were now described by him as people who had formed an "anti-Party alliance" with him, and he said how they divided their work when attacking the Party, etc. He attempted to muddy the waters in order to provoke the relationship between the Party and some leftist elements in the League organization, and to confuse some middle-of-the-road elements who were unaware of the truth. However, Wang Dachuan's rogue behavior was shattered by the many facts and arguments presented by the people.
　　Wang Dachuan's anti-communist and anti-people stance has a long-standing historical root. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he recognized a Japanese spy as his godfather and was sent to Japan for "advanced studies," only returning shortly before Japan's surrender. Later, he entered Tsinghua University and founded the "University Weekly," advocating taking the middle road. In 1948, Wang Dachuan went to Hong Kong and participated in military speculation activities with Zhang Bojun and others. After the liberation of Beijing, he went to Beijing hoping to speculate and participate in the "CPPCC," but did not achieve his goal. His capitalist brother committed "five poisons" and was struggled against in the "Five-Anti" movement, making him even more dissatisfied with the new society. Wang Dachuan joined the China Democratic League in 1950 and worked at the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the League. He was determined to use the League as political capital to achieve his ulterior motives.

### 扭转软弱无力状况　加强反右派领导　天津民盟市委斗倒了王大川

　　扭转软弱无力状况　加强反右派领导
　　天津民盟市委斗倒了王大川
    本报讯　民盟天津市委在反右派斗争中一度软弱无力。7月下旬以来扭转了这一状况，加强了领导小组的工作，深入开展了反右派斗争，现正进一步揭露章罗联盟在天津的代理人、右派分子王大川的许多反动行为，粉碎了王大川玩弄的新花招。
    根据揭露的材料，王大川利用共产党整风的机会，曾鼓动、支持或指使天津民用建筑设计院的盟员、右派分子王桂丘、栗培英，南开大学的盟员、右派分子李宝震、陈国庆，天津大学的盟员、右派分子杨思慎、杜凯，河北天津师范学院的盟员、右派分子李利民等，捏造党的所谓根本性的缺点，以降低党的威信，削弱党的领导，好让这些右派分子“上台”。
    王大川曾通过民盟天津市委机关中的右派分子郑纬世，天津铁路工程学校中的盟员、右派分子李长福，天津疏浚公司中的盟员、右派分子韩波平，南开大学中的盟员、右派分子李宝震等，采取封官许愿、请客吃饭、送礼拉拢、造谣诱骗、介绍恋爱对象等等卑鄙手段，专门发展对党不满的人和历次运动中被斗争的对象入盟。据王大川承认，他这样作的目的，是为了把民盟组织发展成为“党的敌手”。
    当王大川的反动言行在6月下旬初步被揭露出来的时候，王大川即指使他的亲信郑纬世到处喊“冤”，说这是靠拢党的人对王大川进行“宗派斗争”。等到民盟天津市委深入开展了反右派斗争，进一步查出王大川的许多反动言行以后，王大川在铁的事实面前无法抵赖，才承认了他上述的一些反动言行；但却又在假装低头认罪的掩护下耍起新的花招。原来被他认为是跟他进行“宗派斗争”的人，现在又被他说成是跟他结成“反党联盟”的人，并且说他们在向党进攻的时候如何分工等等。他企图把水搅浑，以挑拨党和民盟组织中的某些左派分子的关系，迷惑一些不明真相的中间分子。但王大川耍的无赖行为，被人们摆出的许多事实和道理所粉碎了。
    王大川反共反人民是有长久的历史根源的。在抗日战争时期，他曾认了一个日本特务作义父，被送到日本去“深造”，日本投降前夕才回来。以后他进了清华大学，创办“大学周报”，鼓吹走中间路线。1948年，王大川到香港，曾参与章伯钧等的军事投机活动。北京解放后，他到北京想投机参加“政协”，但没有达到目的。他的资本家哥哥犯“五毒”，在“五反”运动中被斗，他对新社会更加不满。王大川1950年加入民盟，并到天津盟市委工作，他一心想利用民盟作为政治资本，达到他不可告人的目的。
