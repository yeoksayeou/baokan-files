Before liberation, his hands were stained with the blood of revolutionaries; after liberation, he repeatedly instigated mutinies among his former subordinates.
Jiang Yuntai's counter-revolutionary acts were severely denounced.
(Our report) The people of Gansu are currently denouncing Jiang Yuntai, a standing committee member of the Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK).

During the rectification campaign, Jiang Yuntai, posing as a "spokesperson for uprising officers," launched a series of attacks against the Party with eloquent pronouncements, insisting that "the Communist Party has policies and promises, but they have not been implemented." He exaggerated, saying, "You can ask around in Dingxi; which uprising member hasn't been imprisoned?" and "Bian Xianqiao became a bandit because the government didn't say a few kind words and forced him to become one." Jiang Yuntai used these words to incite the dissatisfaction of uprising personnel towards the Party, plotting to instigate mutiny among his former subordinates.

In recent days, materials revealed from a series of meetings of the Provincial People's Political Consultative Conference, the Provincial RCCK, and letters from the broad masses of the people show that Jiang Yuntai is a devil who rose to prominence through anti-communism and was a mass murderer. As far back as the Long March of the Red Army, he personally led troops to intercept the Lazikou Pass, defended Minxian for fifty-eight days, and strenuously prevented the Red Army from heading north. As a result, he was appreciated by Chiang Kai-shek and leaped to become the deputy commander of the puppet 165th Division. In the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, when he was stationed in Dingbian in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, he extorted money from the people, raped women, ran gambling dens, and trafficked drugs, committing all kinds of evil. In 1943, he was also the executioner who suppressed the peasant uprising in the Tao River basin, using the blood of peasants to dye himself a grand red robe and become the commander of the puppet New 3rd Division. In 1949, when the People's Liberation Army marched into Gansu with overwhelming force, Jiang Yuntai led the puppet 119th Army to resist stubbornly. After the defeat, he shrunk his troops into the Wudu mountainous area and continued to organize the Longnan Corps, attempting a last-ditch struggle. Finally, when he had no way out, he was forced to revolt.

For such a person with his hands stained with the blood of the people, the Party and the People's Government did not hold his past against him after liberation, giving him the position of commander of the Independent 3rd Army. Later, he was appointed as the deputy director of the Counselor's Office, the director of the Provincial Sports Commission, a representative to the Provincial People's Congress, and a standing committee member of the Provincial Political Consultative Conference. In principle, he should have reformed himself and atoned for his sins to the people. But the reality is not so. From the day of the uprising, Jiang Yuntai painstakingly placed some people with unclear political backgrounds in his army, while also releasing a group of secret agents, and conspiring to instigate mutiny in the uprising troops. In January 1950, when the 9th Division of the Independent 3rd Army was transferred from Wudu to the west, Jiang Yuntai designated the division headquarters and its subordinate 25th and 26th regiments to be stationed in Xihe, while specifically assigning the division's better-equipped cavalry regiment to be stationed in Luojiabao in Lixian, more than a hundred miles away from the division headquarters. In early April, the cavalry regiment conspired to mutiny. Now, according to Jiang Yuntai's former subordinate, "Division Commander" Yang Bolian's confession, this conspiracy to mutiny was ordered by Jiang Yuntai. The 25th Regiment stationed in Xihe also attempted to mutiny. It was later found that the mutiny was instigated by Zhao Shoushan, the leader of the Hongmen Society in Xihe County and a close friend of Jiang's, in collusion with a few bad elements of the 25th Regiment. Some of the people for whom Jiang Yuntai spared no effort to shout injustice are actually current counter-revolutionaries with conclusive evidence. For example, Bian Xianqiao, after being forced to revolt in 1949, was ordered by Jiang to gather local armed forces, incorporate bandits, and contact secret societies in Wenxian, Bikou, and Qingmuchuan to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. When Bian Xianqiao was demobilized in 1950, he had another secret talk with Jiang Yuntai. Jiang instructed him, telling him to "stay calm," and saying, "Everyone has only one life. Are people who have survived two chi five afraid of death?" Finally, Jiang also gave him a horse. Three to five days after Bian Xianqiao returned home, he ran to southern Gansu to become a bandit, accepting firearms and communications equipment airdropped by US-Chiang agents. Finally, he was killed by the People's Liberation Army. In the eight years since liberation, Jiang Yuntai has also constantly colluded with some counter-revolutionary elements. On the eve of the secret agent Wang Yudeng's flight to Taiwan, he made a special visit to Jiang Yuntai, claiming that he would protect Jiang Yuntai as the "Commander-in-Chief for Suppressing Bandits" in Gansu. Before the counter-revolutionary element Zhang Yansan was arrested, he also had close ties with Jiang Yuntai. Jiang often encouraged Zhang, saying, "Broaden your mind and look further ahead!" Some counter-revolutionary elements who have been suppressed in recent years, such as Cao Jianqun, Zhang Zhengxiang, and Yang Hongyi, were all Jiang's confidants and often frequented Jiang's home. Jiang Yuntai not only hates the Communist Party, but also hates and attacks progressive figures in the RCCK organization. In the Provincial Committee of the RCCK, he colluded with Wang Zhiqi (Deputy Chairman of the Provincial RCCK), Yu Fanggao, and others to engage in small factional activities, attack activists, and attempt to usurp the leadership of the RCCK in order to further confront the Communist Party. In this struggle against the rightists, the people of Gansu will never let Jiang Yuntai get away with it.

    解放前双手染满革命者的鲜血  解放后又多次策动旧部叛变
    蒋云台反革命行为遭到痛击
    本报讯  甘肃人民正在声讨省民革常委蒋云台。
    整风期间，蒋云台以“起义军官的代言人”的姿态振振有词地向党发动了一连串的攻击，硬说“共产党有政策，有诺言，但是没有实行”。他并夸大其词的说“可以到定西打问一下，哪一个起义的没有坐过牢？”“边仙桥当土匪是政府没有说几句温暖话，硬把他逼上梁山的”。蒋云台用这些话来煽动起义人员对党的不满，阴谋策动他的旧部叛变。
    连日以来，从省政协、省民革一系列会议和广大人民群众的来信，所揭发的材料中可以看出，蒋云台是一个靠反共起家、杀人如麻的魔王。远在红军长征时，他就亲率人马，截堵腊子口，死守岷县五十八天，力阻红军北上，因此，他得到蒋介石的赏识，一跃而为伪一六五师的副师长。抗日战争初期，他驻扎在陕甘宁边区的定边时，搜刮民财，强奸妇女，放赌贩毒，无恶不作。1943年他又是镇压洮河流域农民起义的刽子手，以农民的鲜血给自己染大红袍，当上伪新三师师长。1949年，当人民解放军以雷霆万钧之势进军甘肃时，蒋云台率领伪一一九军负隅顽抗。溃败以后，他把部队龟缩到武都山区，继续组织陇南兵团，企图垂死挣扎。最后，在走头无路的情况下，才被迫起义。
    对于这样一个双手沾满人民鲜血的人，解放后党和人民政府不咎既往，给他以独三军军长的职位。后又让他当参事室副主任、省体委主任委员、省人民代表大会的代表、省政协常委。按理，他应该革面洗心，向人民赎罪才是。但是事实不然。从起义的那天起，蒋云台就苦心积虑，在他的军队里安插一些政治面目不清的人，同时又放走了一批特务，并阴谋策动起义部队叛变。1950年1月，独三军第九师由武都向西移防时，蒋云台指定师部及所属的二十五、二十六两个团驻西和，偏把该师装备较好的骑兵团指定驻在远距师部百余里的礼县罗家堡。4月初，骑兵团阴谋叛变，现在，据蒋云台的旧部“师长”杨伯连检举，这次阴谋叛变是奉蒋云台之命的。驻在西和的二十五团也曾图谋叛变，事后查明，叛变是由西和县的红帮头子、蒋的密友赵寿山勾结二十五团少数坏分子策动的。蒋云台不惜力竭声嘶为他们呼冤的一些人实际上都是证据确凿的现行反革命犯。如边仙桥，1949年被迫起义后，他奉蒋之命到文县、碧口、青木川一带纠合地方武装，收编土匪，联络帮会，进行反革命活动。1950年边仙桥复员时他又和蒋云台作一次密谈，蒋向他面授机宜，要他“沉住气”，说“一人一条命，穿过二尺五的人还怕死么？”最后蒋还赠给他一匹马。边仙桥复员到家之后三、五天，就跑到甘南当土匪，接受美蒋特务空投的枪弹和通讯器材。最后他被解放军击毙了。解放八年以来，蒋云台还不断同一些反革命分子勾勾搭搭。特务王禹登逃往台湾的前夕，曾专诚登门拜访蒋云台，声称要保蒋云台为甘肃的“剿匪总司令”。反革命分子张彦三被捕之前，也和蒋云台过从甚密。蒋经常鼓励张说：“把心胸放宽些，把眼光放远些”！几年来被镇压的一些反革命分子如曹建群、张正祥和杨鸿义等皆为蒋的亲信，经常出入蒋的家中。蒋云台不仅仇恨共产党，而且还仇恨和打击民革组织中的进步人物。在民革省委中，他勾结王治岐（省民革副主委）、俞方皋等，搞小宗派活动，打击积极分子，企图篡夺民革的领导权，以便进一步和共产党分庭抗礼。在这次反右派斗争中，甘肃人民决不让蒋云台蒙混过关。
