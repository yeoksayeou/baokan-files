    On Wu Zuguang's "Chaos"
    Jia Ke
    Rightist elements have a common saying, that today's new China is already in great "chaos," and Wu Zuguang is no exception. At the Second Rectification Forum of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles on May 31 (see Drama News, Issue 14), he began by saying: "I have lived for forty years, and I have never seen it as chaotic as it has been in recent years. Everyone I meet is full of resentment, whether their opinions are the same or different, whether they are party members or non-party members, leaders or those being led, they are all full of resentment, which shows that there is chaos." Wu Zuguang has lived for forty years, and since he has never seen it as "chaotic" as it has been in recent years, then it means that the thirty-odd years before these recent years were not "chaotic" in Wu Zuguang's view.
    Let's take a look. Forty years ago was 1917, which was the sixth year of the Republic of China. At that time, Zhang Xun was restoring the monarchy, trying to put Puyi, who had been abandoned by the Xinhai Revolution, back on the emperor's throne. Zhang Xun's restoration activities failed due to opposition from various places, and then came years of warlord separatism and war, and the common people did not have a single day of peace. All of this, in Wu Zuguang's view, of course, does not count as "chaos." After that, Chiang Kai-shek's fascist dictatorship ruled for more than twenty years, with white terror, and countless patriotic people were brutally murdered. How many of China's most outstanding sons and daughters died under the Kuomintang's massacre, numbering in the millions? During the War of Resistance Against Japan, people fled everywhere, and many families were separated; Japanese imperialism implemented the Three Alls Policy (kill all, burn all, loot all) in the liberated areas, creating hundreds of miles of uninhabited no-man's-land, and mass graves. The people finally looked forward to the victory of the War of Resistance, but Chiang Kai-shek colluded with American imperialism to launch a civil war. The four major families of Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen frantically plundered, and landlords and despots ran rampant, imposing exorbitant taxes and levies, and the people could not even eat mixed flour... All of this, in Wu Zuguang's view, of course, does not count as "chaos." So what are the chaotic years? Wu Zuguang said: It is these recent years. These recent years—under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people defeated Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang and established the People's Republic of China. In just a few years, they victoriously carried out land reform, the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Campaigns, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, ideological remolding, and the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts and private industry and commerce; the people have turned over from thousands of years of poverty and enslavement and have begun to move towards a thriving socialism. But Wu Zuguang insisted that he has lived for forty years and has never seen it as "chaotic" as it has been in recent years. Today, the families of those martyrs, the people who fought in the no-man's-land, and the millions of people who suffered pain and disaster in the old society want to question Wu Zuguang, why are you so nostalgic and praise the "polite" old society, saying that it is not chaotic? Today, those ordinary workers, peasants, and citizens who have just begun to live a good life in the new society want to question you, Wu Zuguang, why do you insist that today's new society is in great "chaos"? People can't help but ask, who is causing trouble there? Who is stirring up trouble there? It turns out that the chaos is not caused by others, but by this group of demons and monsters. Starting this spring, taking advantage of the arrogance of international reactionary forces after the Hungarian incident and the opportunity of the Chinese Communist Party's rectification campaign, a gust of wind was stirred up, causing countless huge waves, saying everywhere "it's chaos", saying "the Communist Party is not working", saying "the new society is a mess", saying "the organizational system is stupid", the Communist Party "better not lead literature and art", saying that the backstage "is full of murderous intent, and a great war is about to break out"... Rightist elements are setting fires everywhere, asking "what's wrong" and "what troubles you", spreading rumors and slanders, inciting reversals of verdicts; wasn't a bomb already thrown into the home of the Party Secretary of the Medical College, and didn't illegal landlords kill revolutionary masses with knives?
    The rightist elements did cause chaos for a while, but while they were frantically causing trouble, they shouted loudly, "stop thief", saying that "everywhere is full of resentment". Wu Zuguang said that the people he met, whether their opinions were the same or different, whether they were party members or non-party members, leaders or those being led, were all "full of resentment". Is this really the case? Wu Zuguang did meet some people who were full of resentment, but who were these people? It turned out that they were all objects of investigation during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries; figures who had dealings with spies and counter-revolutionaries in the factory history, reporters who wrote anti-communist articles, people from landlord families who were dissatisfied with the Party, members of reactionary "small families," and renegades who betrayed the Party... This group of people did have some resentment, and they had always been full of resentment towards the Party and the people. As the saying goes, "birds of a feather flock together," and the "resentment" of such people was all met by Wu Zuguang, so Wu Zuguang stood up and spoke out for them, encouraging them to overturn the verdict against the Party, and everywhere he spoke up for them, saying that "they were loyal to the revolution before liberation and did a lot of work, but they were severely criticized during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries... It was really a cruel thing." We want to ask Wu Zuguang, do you have any real evidence that anyone who was loyal to the revolution was severely criticized for no reason? Without evidence, then what is your purpose in slandering and spreading rumors like this? Wu Zuguang wants the Federation of Literary and Art Circles to publish a booklet, "to inform everyone of the list of those who have been wronged in the literary and art circles." Wu Zuguang is indeed worthy of being a "talent," and he has materialized the "Rehabilitation Committee" of the big rightist Luo Longji.
    What is the purpose of Wu Zuguang saying "chaos"? He himself answered it very clearly: According to Wu Zuguang's logic, the world was not chaotic originally, but it became chaotic because of the leadership of the Communist Party; therefore, Wu Zuguang openly clamored that "the organizational system is stupid," and the Party "better not lead artistic work." Then, if the Party doesn't lead literature and art, can it lead other things? Wu Zuguang said that it won't work, "laymen cannot lead experts," the Communist Party is all laymen and cannot lead, so it has to give way and step down. If the Communist Party steps down, the rightist elements will of course take the stage. Wu Zuguang was born in the year that Zhang Xun restored the monarchy, and forty years later, Wu Zuguang wants capitalism to be restored in China. The rightist elements are shouting that the world is in great "chaos," but in fact, they are afraid that the world will not be chaotic, so they can take advantage of the chaos to rob and make a fortune. Now, the people are truly suppressing the "chaos"!

    谈吴祖光的“乱”
    贾克
    右派分子有一句共同的语言，都说今天新中国的天下已经大“乱”了，吴祖光也不例外。他在5月31日文联第二次整风座谈会上（见第十四期戏剧报）一开头就说：“我活到四十岁了，从没看到像这几年这样乱过。遇见的人都是怨气冲天，不论意见相同或不相同，也不论是党员或非党员，领导或被领导，都是怨气冲天，这说明了乱”。吴祖光活了四十年了，既然他从来没看到像这几年这样“乱”过，那么就是说，这几年之前的三十多年，在吴祖光看来就都是不“乱”了。
    我们来看看，四十年前是1917年，也就是民国六年，当时正是张勋复辟，想把被辛亥革命遗弃的宣统，重新扶上皇帝宝座的时候。张勋的复辟活动由于各地反对遭到失败之后，连年军阀割据，兵荒马乱，老百姓没有一天得到安生。这些在吴祖光看来，当然不算“乱”了。这以后蒋介石法西斯独裁统治二十多年，白色恐怖，无数爱国志士横遭惨害，中国最优秀的儿女，死在国民党屠杀下的何止千万；抗日战争期间，人民到处流亡逃难，多少人家庭妻离子散；日本帝国主义在解放区实行杀光、烧光、抢光的三光政策，制造几百里荒无人烟的无人区，万人坑。人民好容易盼到抗战胜利了，可是蒋介石又勾结美帝国主义发动内战，蒋宋孔陈四大家族疯狂的掠夺，地主恶霸横行霸道，苛捐杂税，人民连混合面都吃不饱……所有这些在吴祖光看来，当然也不算是“乱”了。那么什么才是乱的年头呢？吴祖光说：就是这几年。这几年——中国人民在共产党的领导下，打败了国民党蒋介石，建立了中华人民共和国，短短的几年就胜利地进行了土地改革，抗美援朝，三反五反，镇压反革命，思想改造以及社会主义三大改造；人民从几千年的贫困、被奴役下面翻身，开始走向欣欣向荣的社会主义。而吴祖光硬说他活了四十岁，从来没看到像这几年这样“乱”过。今天那些烈士的家属，在无人区战斗过来的人民，和千百万在旧社会饱受痛苦灾难的人们，要质问吴祖光，你为什么对千疮百孔“多礼的”旧社会那么留恋、赞扬，说是不乱？今天那些在新社会刚刚开始过好日子的普通工人、农民、市民要质问你吴祖光，你为什么偏偏说今天新社会反倒天下大“乱”？人民不禁要问到底是谁在那里捣乱？是什么人在那里兴风作乱？原来乱的不是别人，是这批牛鬼蛇神。从今年的春季开始，趁着匈牙利事件之后，国际反动势力嚣张的当儿和中国共产党整风的机会，刮起一阵狂风，掀起无数巨浪，到处说“乱”，说“共产党不行了”，说“新社会一团糟”，说“组织制度是愚蠢的”，共产党“趁早别领导文艺”，说后台“杀气腾腾，有大战一触即发之势”……右派分子到处放火，访“疾”问“苦”，造谣诬蔑，煽动翻案；不是炸弹已经扔进了医学院党委书记的家里，不法地主执刀杀害了革命群众么？
    右派分子确是乱了一阵，正当他们疯狂捣乱的时候，却大嚷大叫，“贼喊抓贼”，说什么“到处都是怨气冲天”。吴祖光说他所遇见的人，不论意见相同或不相同，也不论是党员或非党员、领导或被领导，都是“怨气冲天”。果真是这样么？吴祖光是遇见了些怨气冲天的人，但那是些什么人呢？原来都是些肃反时被审查的对象；厂史上和特务反革命有来往的人物，写反共文章的记者，地主家庭出身，对党不满的人，反动性质的“小家族”成员，以及变节叛党分子……这一批人确是有些怨气，他们从来对党对人民就是怨气冲天的。常说“物以类聚”，这样一些人的“怨气”都被吴祖光遇见了，于是吴祖光挺身而出，为他们鸣不平，怂恿他们向党翻案，到处为他们伸冤、叫屈，说“解放前对革命忠心耿耿，做了很多工作，而肃反中却狠狠斗了他们……真是很残忍的事”。我们要问吴祖光，你有没有真凭实据，哪一个对革命忠心耿耿的人，无缘无故被狠狠的斗了？没有根据，那么你这样血口喷人，造谣诬蔑，到底是为了什么？吴祖光要文联出小册子，“把文艺界内受冤枉者的名单，通知大家”，到底吴祖光不愧是“才子”，他把大右派分子罗隆基的“平反委员会”具体化了。
    吴祖光说“乱”的目的是什么呢？他自己回答的很清楚：按照吴祖光的逻辑说法，天下本来不乱，就是因为共产党领导才大乱了的；所以吴祖光公然叫嚣说：“组织制度是愚蠢的”，党“趁早别领导艺术工作”。那么党不领导文艺去领导别的行不行呢？吴祖光说也不行，“外行不能领导内行”，共产党都是外行，不能领导只好让位下台了。共产党下台，右派分子当然就上台了。吴祖光出生的那年是张勋复辟，四十年后的今天吴祖光要资本主义在中国复辟。右派分子们大喊天下已经大“乱”，其实是他们唯恐天下不乱，好趁火打劫，从中大捞一把。现在，人民倒是真正的平“乱”了！
