    Summer Corn Needs Topdressing

    The planting area of summer corn accounts for about one-third of the national corn planting area, mainly distributed in the central and southern parts of North China, the Huai River basin, Guanzhong in Shaanxi, and some areas in the south. At present, its yield per unit area is lower than the national average corn yield. Therefore, striving to increase the yield of summer corn is of great significance for giving full play to the high-yield performance of corn and increasing total grain output.

    Now is the peak growing season for summer corn. Doing a good job in topdressing can help achieve increased production. Corn is a crop with a strong ability to absorb fertilizer. Summer corn has a shorter growing period and generally insufficient base fertilizer application, making timely topdressing even more important. Huang County in Shandong and Meng County in Henan are well-known high-yield areas for summer corn in the country. One of their important experiences in achieving high yields is timely topdressing. Applying ammonium sulfate, soybean cake commercial fertilizer, or human urine and manure water and other fast-acting fertilizers to summer corn all yields good results. In 1956, the corn in six farms in Laiyang, Jining, and other places in Shandong increased production by an average of 24.3% per mu by irrigating with 1,000 to 2,000 jin of urine.

    At present, some places do not have enough fertilizer. In addition to actively exploring sources of fertilizer, rational utilization of the existing fertilizer can also exert a great effect. For topdressing summer corn, if there is more fertilizer, it can be applied in stages—twice after seedling setting and before tasseling. Han Junchang, a summer corn model worker in Luoyang, Henan, who achieved high yields, adopted the "three attacks" fertilization method, focusing on topdressing during the seedling stage, the stalk stage, and the ear stage, achieving thousand-jin yields year after year. If there is not much fertilizer, it is still more effective to apply it once before tasseling. The results of the summer corn fertilization experiment conducted by the Hebei Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences from 1954 to 1956 showed that applying 20 jin of ammonium sulfate per mu increased production by 17% when applied before sowing, 23% when applied after seedling setting, and 48% when applied before tasseling, compared to no application. In terms of fertilization methods, concentrated fertilization is also a good habit in many areas. Generally, holes or ditches are dug three or four inches away from the corn roots for topdressing, and the soil is covered after application. This can save fertilizer and improve fertilizer efficiency. Agricultural departments and agricultural technology extension stations in various places should earnestly summarize and promote advanced fertilization experimental results and mass experiences, seize the time to do a good job in topdressing, which will play a huge role in striving for a bumper corn harvest this year.

### 夏玉米需要追肥

    夏玉米需要追肥
    夏玉米的种植面积约占全国玉米播种面积的三分之一左右，主要分布在华北的中南部、淮河流域、陕西关中以及南方的一些地区。目前它的单位面积产量低于全国玉米平均产量，因此，努力提高夏玉米的产量，对发挥玉米高产性能和增加粮食总产量具有重要的意义。
    现在正是夏玉米生长旺期，做好追肥工作，就能争取增产。玉米是吸肥力强的作物。夏玉米由于生育期较短和一般施的基肥不足，及时追肥更为重要。山东黄县和河南孟县是全国夏玉米有名的高产区，它们丰产的重要经验之一就是及时追肥。对夏玉米追施硫铵、豆饼商品肥或人尿、粪水等速效性肥料，效果都很好。1956年山东莱阳、济宁等六个农场的玉米，每亩浇尿，一千到二千斤，平均可增产24.3％。
    目前有些地方的肥料不够充足，除了积极开辟肥源外，对现在仅有的肥料，加以合理利用，也能发挥很大效用。对夏玉米的追肥，如果肥料较多，可以实行分期追施——在定苗后和抽穗前进行二次。河南洛阳夏玉米丰产劳模韩俊昌，则是采用了“三攻”施肥法，掌握攻苗、攻杆和攻穗的三个环节追肥，连年获得千斤丰产。如果肥料不多，还是采用抽穗前一次施肥的效果较大。河北省农业科学研究所1954—1956年的夏玉米施肥试验结果：每亩用二十斤硫铵，施在播种前的较不施的增产17％，定苗后施的增产23％，抽穗前施的增产48％。在施肥方法上，集中施肥也是很多地区的良好习惯，一般在玉米根旁三、四寸的地方开穴或开沟追施，施后复土，这样可以节省肥料，提高肥效。各个地方农业部门和农业技术推广站应该认真总结和推广先进的施肥试验成果和群众经验，抓紧时间做好追肥工作，对争取今年玉米丰收将会起巨大作用。
