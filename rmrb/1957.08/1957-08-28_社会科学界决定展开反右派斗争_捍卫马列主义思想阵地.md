Xinhua News Agency, 27th - The Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences convened a meeting of its Standing Committee this morning, resolving to immediately launch an anti-Rightist struggle in the social sciences community to defend Marxism-Leninism and shatter the conspiracy of bourgeois social science restoration.

　　Fan Wenlan, Yu Guangyuan, Jian Bozan, Di Chaobai, Jin Yuelin, Luo Changpei and others spoke at the meeting. They believed that the Rightists were attempting to restore bourgeois social science and engaging in anti-Communist, anti-socialist, and anti-Marxist-Leninist activities, which were an important part of the Zhang-Luo Alliance's political conspiracy. Therefore, launching an anti-Rightist struggle in the social sciences community is of great significance.

　　The meeting pointed out that Rightists such as Fei Xiaotong, Wu Jingchao, and Li Jinghan, through publishing articles and holding gatherings, had engaged in a series of activities attempting to restore bourgeois sociology. They eventually drafted a concrete plan including the establishment of research institutions, the establishment of sociology departments in universities, and the establishment of a "Sociological Society". The Rightists' aim was not only to revive bourgeois sociology in our country and seize the ideological position of Marxism-Leninism, but also to create, provoke and expand contradictions in various aspects under the guise of academic research, in order to oppose the Communist Party and socialism. In May and June, the Rightist Chen Zhenhan, professor at Peking University, and others drafted a programmatic document called "Our Opinions on the Current Economic Science Work". In this document, Chen Zhenhan and others wantonly attacked the Communist Party's leadership of the national economic work, negated the great achievements of our socialist economic construction, slandered Marxism-Leninism, provoked the relationship between the Communist Party and intellectuals, and openly demanded that bourgeois "economists" participate in national economic decision-making, replacing Marxist economics with bourgeois economics. The activities of the Rightists in "sociology" and economics were, in fact, a concretization of the Zhang-Luo Alliance's anti-socialist scientific program.

　　The Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences will hold a meeting soon to expose and criticize the reactionary words and deeds of these Rightists.

    社会科学界决定展开反右派斗争
　　捍卫马列主义思想阵地
    新华社27日讯　中国科学院哲学社会科学部今天上午召开常务委员会会议，决定立即在社会科学界展开反右派斗争，捍卫马克思列宁主义，粉碎资产阶级社会科学复辟的阴谋。
    会上，范文澜、于光远、翦伯赞、狄超白、金岳霖、罗常培等都发了言。他们认为右派分子图谋使资产阶级社会科学复辟，进行反共、反社会主义、反马列主义的活动，是章罗联盟政治阴谋的重要组成部分，因此目前在社会科学界开展反右派斗争，具有重要意义。
    会上指出，右派分子费孝通、吴景超、李景汉等利用发表文章、串连集会等方式，在企图使资产阶级社会学复辟方面进行了一系列的活动；最后并拟订了包括成立研究机构，在大学里建立社会学系，成立“社会学会”等内容的具体方案。右派分子的目的，不仅在于使资产阶级社会学在我国死灰复燃，夺取马列主义的思想阵地，而且是为了假借学术研究名义，制造、挑拨和扩大各方面的矛盾，以便用来反对共产党和社会主义。5、6月间，右派分子、北京大学教授陈振汉等草拟了一个称为“我们对于当前经济科学工作的一些意见”的纲领性的文件。陈振汉等在这个文件中肆意攻击共产党对国家经济工作的领导，抹煞我国社会主义经济建设的伟大成绩，污蔑马克思列宁主义，挑拨共产党和知识分子的关系，并且公然要求让资产阶级“经济学家”参与国家经济工作的决策，以资产阶级经济学来代替马克思主义的经济学。右派分子在“社会学”方面和经济学方面的活动，实际上是章罗联盟的反社会主义科学纲领的具体化。
    哲学社会科学部将在最近召开会议，对这些右派分子的反动言行进行揭发和批判。
