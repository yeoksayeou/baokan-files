　　"Where to Go?"
　　——Reflections on the Lebanese Film "Where Do We Go Now?"
    Xie Liming
    I have never been to Lebanon, but after watching the film "Where Do We Go Now?" I have gained some understanding of the Lebanese people. "Where Do We Go Now?" reflects the life and aspirations of a section of the people (farmers and educated youth) through the experiences of a family, making us deeply feel the kindness, simplicity, and tenacious will of the Lebanese people.
    "Where Do We Go Now?" depicts the story of a Lebanese person leaving his hometown, crossing the ocean, and seeking happiness in the Americas. In a poor and simple farming family, an old woman, whose husband left home twenty years ago, lives a hard life with her two grown-up sons. Just as she had despaired of her husband, who had disappeared without a trace, and just as her second son had decided to go to the Americas because he could not find a job in the country, her long-lost husband suddenly returned home. But, once a spirited, confident, burly and strong man, he was now reduced to a disheveled, old, and decrepit figure with a beard reaching his chest. The son naturally could not recognize him. He concealed his identity, told the second son, who was determined to venture across the sea, about his painful experiences overseas, persuaded him to give up his illusions, and gave him a blood transfusion (his second son was hit by a car and lost too much blood at the time), and then reluctantly left again.
    After World War I, Lebanon was reduced to a colony of imperialism. During World War II, it nominally achieved independence. In 1946, due to the struggle of the Lebanese people, the strong support of the Soviet Union, and the coordination of the world's anti-colonial movement, the British and French troops were forced to withdraw, and Lebanon became a sovereign and independent country. The history of Lebanon's long-term colonial status undoubtedly helps us understand the living conditions reflected in the film "Where Do We Go Now?". The Lebanese people's struggle for independence can better help us understand the characters in the film.
    The father in the film, having returned to his hometown after drifting for twenty years, why did he leave again after entering the house? At first glance, it seems that he was ashamed to see people because of his years of frustration, but upon closer inspection, one realizes how kind his heart is. He left because he saw that his family was poor, and if he stayed, he would not only not be able to help, but would also increase their burden. Is this a sign of his weakness? No. On the contrary, this is precisely the tenacious manifestation of the old man's deep-seated will to survive, a spirit of self-sacrifice. We also saw a beautiful soul through his tattered clothes.
    "Where to Go?" The film itself has already provided an important answer to this question, that is, the way out should not be placed in the Americas, the imagined Americas are worlds apart from the real Americas, and the way out should be placed in one's own country. This answer is correct and full of patriotism.
    I am excited to appreciate this beautiful film, not only because the Lebanese film is being screened in our country for the first time, nor only because the film has a certain artistic level, but also because as an Asian I have a special affinity for the Lebanese people. I know that Lebanon's past historical destiny has something in common with our country, I also know that Lebanon has fairly close economic and cultural exchanges with our country today, and I also know that the Lebanese people share the same aspirations as us in maintaining world peace and building a happy life.

　　“向何处去”？
　　——黎巴嫩影片“向何处去”观后感
    谢力鸣
    我没有到过黎巴嫩，但看了影片“向何处去”之后，却多少对黎巴嫩的人民有了一点了解。“向何处去”通过一个家庭的遭遇反映了一部分人民群众（农民和知识青年）的生活和愿望，使我们深深地感到黎巴嫩人民的善良、朴实和顽强的意志。
    “向何处去”描写了一个黎巴嫩人离乡背井，远涉重洋，到美洲去寻求幸福的故事。在一个贫苦朴实的农家里，一个丈夫离家二十来年的老妇人带着已经长大成人的两个儿子过着辛酸的日子。正当她对那一去无音的丈夫已经绝望了的时候，正当她的次子因为在国内找不到职业而决定远走美洲的时候，她那久别的丈夫忽然重返家园。但，曾几何时，他还是个精神抖擞，满怀自信，魁梧强壮的人物，如今却落得须鬓垂胸，蓬头垢面，老态龙钟了。儿子自然不能相认，他把身份隐瞒起来，给那决心越海冒险的次子讲了自己在海外的痛苦遭遇，劝他放弃幻想，并且给他输了血（当时他的次子被车撞伤，失血太多），然后便又恋恋依依地出门而去了。
    黎巴嫩在第一次大战以后沦为帝国主义的殖民地，在第二次大战期中，取得了名义上的独立，到1946年，由于黎巴嫩人民的斗争取得苏联的有力支持和世界人民反殖民主义运动的配合，方才迫使英法两国军队撤退，成为主权独立的国家。黎巴嫩长期处于殖民地状态的历史，无疑可以帮助我们理解影片“向何处去”所反映的生活状况。黎巴嫩人民为争取独立所进行的斗争更可以帮助我们理解影片中的人物性格。
    影片中的父亲，既已在颠沛流离二十来年之后重归故乡，为什么进了家门还要走开呢？草草看来，似乎是因他多年落魄羞于见人的缘故，细心去看，方知他胸有多么善良的心怀。他是因见家中贫困，自己若留下来不但不能出力相助，反而为她们增加累赘，所以才走开的。这是不是他软弱的表现呢？不是。相反，这正是这个衰弱的老人内心深处的求生意志的顽强表现，是一种牺牲自己的精神。我们也透过了他那褴褛衣衫，看见一颗多么美丽的灵魂。
    “向何处去”？这个问题，影片本身已经作了重要的回答，那就是不应把出路放在美洲，幻想中的美洲同真实的美洲是有天地之差的，应当把出路放在自己的祖国。这个答复是正确的，是十足爱国主义的。
    我怀着兴奋的心情来欣赏这部优美的影片，这不仅因为黎巴嫩影片是首次在我国上映，也不仅因为这部影片具有一定的艺术水平，而且因为我作为一个亚洲人对黎巴嫩人民有一种特别亲切的感情。我知道黎巴嫩过去的历史命运有同我国相同之处，我也知道今日黎巴嫩同我国有相当密切的经济和文化往来，我也知道黎巴嫩人民在维护世界和平，建设幸福生活的道路上是和我们有着共同的愿望的。
