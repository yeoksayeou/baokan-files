Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, 13th—Women's javelin thrower Wang Yi created a new national record in the javelin throw with a distance of 42.97 meters on the 11th in Lüda.

    The national record of 41.38 meters for women's javelin, held by Li Xuezhu, has been broken more than once this year, but this is the first time the javelin has been thrown over 42 meters.

    Wang Yi set this new national record on August 11th during the four-unit track and field competition held in Lüda. In this track and field competition, which included the Beijing Institute of Physical Education, the Chengdu Institute of Physical Education, the Lüda City team, and the "August 1st" track and field team of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, hammer thrower Bi Hongfu once again broke his national hammer throw record of 48.74 meters, which he set last year, but this time his achievement did not exceed 50 meters.

    王毅创女子标枪全国最高纪录
    新华社旅大13日电　女子标枪运动员王毅11日在旅大创造了标枪掷远的全国最高成绩——四十二公尺九十七公分。
    由李雪祖保持的女子标枪四十一公尺三十八公分的全国纪录，今年已经不止一次被打破，但是把标枪扔过四十二公尺，这还是头一回。
    王毅是8月11日在旅大举行的四单位田径对抗赛中，创造这项全国新成绩的。在这次举行的有北京体育学院、成都体育学院、旅大市和中国人民解放军“八一”田径队参加的田径对抗赛中，链球运动员毕鸿福再一次打破了他去年创造的四十八公尺七十四公分的链球全国纪录，但是他这次创造的成绩没能超过五十公尺。
