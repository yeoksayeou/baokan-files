    "Red Rock's" "Random Shots"
    Yan Xu
    Recently, I received the July issue of the "Red Rock" literary monthly, and I read all of its articles in one breath. Strangely, while the people of the whole country are engaged in a vigorous anti-Rightist struggle, this publication remains outside of this fiery struggle. No, it is unfair to say it is "outside" the struggle; it is firing cold shots from the enemy's hiding place. Although that set of "Short Flutes" is played so悠扬悠扬, the flute sound ultimately cannot cover up the firepower of the "random shots" (弹 should be understood as a noun, meaning bullet).
    One "random shot" is "Thoughts Inspired by Killing Sparrows." The author, starting from the discussion in the newspapers about whether sparrows are harmful birds and whether they should be killed—that is, what he calls "a small sparrow case"—turns his pen to speak up for "Grass and Trees," saying that critics criticize "Grass and Trees" with a club. He says that "there is no need to pursue 'Grass and Trees' anymore," but what should be "pursued" is the attitude of criticism towards it!
    The second "random shot" is fired even more clearly. Someone criticized the "Stars" journal for not mentioning socialist realism in its call for submissions, and criticized some people's "thawing" of literary and artistic issues. The author believes that this is the "misfortune" of language and literature. Obviously, in the eyes of this author, ignoring or disregarding socialist realism is not a serious problem; what's so important about it? And before the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom" was put forward, our country's literature and art were frozen solid, with no vitality. Only by allowing such statements can it *not* be a misfortune (!)? In this way, the intention is malicious enough.
    Wang Shaoyan's "Wall" uses the words of a bureaucrat to attack the Party's rectification policy, saying, "The climate here rarely has storms, at most a bit of gentle breeze and drizzle, what is there to fear?" Good, since the bureaucrat is "indifferent" to the gentle breeze and drizzle, then the Party's policy is "wrong" and "ineffective." Does this need further explanation?
    In this so-called satirical play, there are also "jokes" about a construction site director ordering the walls to be built quickly on all sides, without opening doors or windows, and workers being walled inside. It also engages in sowing discord in the relationship between the Party and intellectuals. The author deliberately uses the bureaucrat's words to say things like, "Do you know what they were doing in the Kuomintang-controlled areas before?" and "The cadre review work has not been completely completed, how can we trust them?" etc. In fact, satirizing bureaucracy is just a smokescreen. Deliberately portraying the "wall" as being so serious, believing that gentle breezes and drizzle cannot rectify bureaucracy, this is the author's true intention.
    In the novel "Old Sword Still Sharp," our society is simply described as the "eighteenth level of hell." The old artist Qin Hanqin, possessing unique skills, is slapped by the village director in the village, and his steel hairpin and sandalwood clapper are confiscated. Unable to stay, he runs to the city, but the city's cultural center director refuses to let him perform—the reason being simply because the certificate issued to Qin by his hometown is outdated. Therefore, this old artist almost freezes and starves to death. Coincidentally, he meets a "kind-hearted person" Huo Bin, who can only earn "a few steamed bun coins" a day. Huo Bin and his mother are also artists. Huo Bin uses the little money left for their meals to treat the old artist. Later, the old artist receives help from a "kind-hearted" bourgeois element—Huo Bin's uncle. Huo Bin decides to abandon the revolution and learn "unique skills" from the old artist, but is "roughly interfered with" by the cultural center director, and does not succeed. The cultural center director also drives away the old artist. In the end, Huo Bin receives the old artist's teachings and becomes famous.
    In this novel, the entire environment is "utterly desolate," and these village directors and cultural center directors are no different from the Kuomintang reactionaries in the author's writing. Our country is truly "pitch black" in the author's writing. In order to set off the tragic experiences of Qin Hanqin and Huo Bin, the author does not hesitate to use the scene of our grand reception of Soviet puppet artists to make the most vicious contrast.
    Of course, poisonous weeds are not forbidden, but they must be struggled against. However, "Red Rock" throws out so many poisonous weeds, but does not talk about the anti-Rightist struggle at all. What exactly are their intentions!

    “红岩”的“乱弹”
    雁序
    最近我收到了7月号的“红岩”文艺月刊，我一口气就把它的文章通读一过。奇怪，全国人民轰轰烈烈的反右派斗争，但这个刊物却置身于这个火热的斗争以外，不，说它在斗争“以外”还是冤枉了它的，它正在我们敌方的掩蔽部里射过冷枪来。尽管那一组“短笛”是吹得如此悠扬，但笛声究竟掩不了“乱弹”（弹应作名词解，即子弹的弹）的火力。
    “乱弹”中的一弹是“从捕杀麻雀想到的”，作者从报纸上关于麻雀是否害鸟、应否捕杀问题的讨论——即他所谓“一宗小小的麻雀公案”，把笔锋转到为“草木篇”抱不平了，说批评家批评“草木篇”是棍子。他说对“草木篇”可以“不必穷追下去了”，应该“追”的倒是对它的批评态度！
    第二颗“乱弹”更明确地射出来了。有人批评了“星星”的稿约上不提社会主义现实主义，批评了一些人对文艺问题的“解冻”的提法，作者就认为这是语言文学的“厄运”了。显然，在这位作者看来，忽视或无视社会主义现实主义是不足为病的，有什么了不起呢？而“百花齐放”的政策提出以前，我们国家的文艺硬是冰封三尺，生机息灭，只有允许这样说，才不是厄运（？）！这样，用心是够恶毒了。
    王少燕的“墙”，借了一位官僚主义者的话来攻击党的整风政策，说“这儿的气候，根本就很少狂风暴雨，顶多有点和风细雨，这怕什么？”好啊，既然官僚主义者对和风细雨“无动于衷”，那末党的政策就是“错误”、“无效”的了，这还要再加注解吗？
    在这个所谓讽刺剧中，还有什么工地主任叫四面加紧砌墙，没开门窗，把工人砌在里面等“笑话”，而对党与知识分子的关系，也作了挑拨的工作。作者故意借官僚主义的局长的口，说什么“你知道他们以前在国统区都搞些什么”啦，“审干工作还没有完全结束，怎能信任”啦等等。其实，讽刺官僚主义只是一个幌子。故意把“墙”形容得如何如何严重，认为和风细雨不能整掉官僚主义，这才是作者的真实意图。
    在“宝刀不老”这篇小说里，把我们的社会简直描写成“十八层地狱”一样。老艺人秦汉钦身怀绝艺，在村子里被村主任打了耳光，没收了钢钗和檀板。他呆不住，跑到城市里，但市文化馆长又不给他演唱——理由是仅仅因为乡里出给秦的证明书已经过时。因此这个老艺人差一点冻死饿死。正巧碰到一个每天只能得“几个馍馍钱”的“好心肠人”霍斌，而霍斌和他的母亲也都是艺人。霍斌就把仅存的母子两人的伙食钱请了客。以后那个老艺人又得到一个“好心肠”的资产阶级分子——霍斌的舅舅的帮助。霍斌决心脱离革命，向老艺人学“绝技”，但又被文化馆长“粗暴干涉”，没有成功，文化馆长又赶走了老艺人。而霍斌终于得了老艺人传授，成了名。
    在这篇小说里，整个环境是“凄然欲绝”的，而这些村主任、文化馆长在作者的笔下，跟国民党反动派丝毫没有两样。我们的国家在作者的笔下真是“一片漆黑”。为了衬托秦汉钦和霍斌的悲惨遭遇，作者还不惜用我们隆重招待苏联木偶艺术家的场面来作最恶毒的对比。
    自然，毒草不是不能放，但必须对它进行斗争。可是“红岩”抛出这么许多毒草，对反右派斗争却根本不谈，这到底是何居心！
