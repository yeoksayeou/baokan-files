Xinhua News Agency, August 19th dispatch from Cairo: According to a report in the Cairo newspaper "Al-Ahram" on August 18th, Egyptian President Nasser recently said in an interview with Greek newspaper reporters that even if the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is modified, it will still be unacceptable to Egypt.

He pointed out that "the Eisenhower Doctrine requires adherence to American policies, while Egypt has repeatedly declared that its policy is one of non-alignment and rejection of any aid with conditions attached." Nasser said, "Thus, we reject this doctrine. We believe that trying to modify this doctrine is useless, because it fundamentally still requires accepting the proposition of standing with the United States."

Speaking on the Cyprus issue, Nasser said that Egypt will support Cypriot self-determination. He said, "Egypt's position on the Cyprus issue has already been expressed by the Bandung Conference, which made a resolution supporting the right of peoples to self-determination under the United Nations Charter."

Xinhua News Agency, August 19th dispatch from Cairo: According to a Middle East News Agency correspondent in Khartoum, leaders of major Sudanese political parties have recently issued statements advocating that Sudan pursue a policy of active neutrality.

These leaders published statements on the foreign policy programs of their respective parties in the Khartoum newspaper "Al-Rai al-Aam" in advance of the parliamentary elections to be held in February next year.

Ali Abdel Rahman, leader of the ruling People's Democratic Party, expressed opposition to the Eisenhower Doctrine. He said that it is a tool for imposing foreign rule on people.

Ismail al-Azhari, Chairman of the National Unionist Party and former Prime Minister, said that the Sudanese people reject the Eisenhower Doctrine and refuse to participate in any military alliances. He said: "We adhere to a policy of active neutrality and cooperation with the Bandung countries."

Mahdi, leader of the ruling National Party, said that although Sudan needs foreign aid to develop its economy, it refuses loans with conditions that restrict Sudan's independence and hinder Sudan from pursuing a policy of active neutrality.

    艾森豪威尔主义即使改头换面
    纳赛尔说埃及还是不接受
    苏丹各党领袖主张恪守中立唾弃美国侵略政策
    新华社19日讯　开罗消息：据开罗“金字塔报”8月18日报道，埃及总统纳赛尔最近在接见希腊报纸记者时说，“艾森豪威尔主义”即使修改了，对于埃及还是不能接受的。
    他指出，“艾森豪威尔主义要求依附美国的政策，而埃及则已经再三宣布，它的政策是不参加集团的政策，并且拒绝任何附有条件的援助。”纳赛尔说，“这样，我们就拒绝了这个主义。我们认为试图修改这个主义是没有用处的，因为它基本上还是要求接受和美国站在一起的主张。”
    纳赛尔在谈到塞浦路斯问题时说，埃及将支持塞浦路斯自决。他说，“埃及在塞浦路斯问题上的主张已经由万隆会议表示过了，那次会议作出了一项决议，支持人民在联合国宪章之下的自决的权利。”
    新华社19日讯　开罗消息：据中东通讯社驻喀土穆记者报道，苏丹各主要政党领导人近来发表声明，主张苏丹执行积极中立政策。
    这些领导人为将在明年2月举行的议会选举在喀土穆的“舆论报”上分别发表了关于自己政党的外交政策纲领的声明。
    执政的人民民主党领导人阿里·阿卜杜勒·拉赫曼表示反对艾森豪威尔主义。他说，这是把外国统治强加于人的一种工具。
    民族联合党主席、前总理伊斯梅尔·阿扎里说，苏丹人民摒弃艾森豪威尔主义，并且拒绝参加各种军事联盟。他说：“我们恪守积极中立和同万隆国家合作的政策。”
    执政的国民党领袖马赫迪说，虽然苏丹需要外国的援助来发展本国的经济，但是，它拒绝附有限制苏丹独立和妨碍苏丹执行积极中立政策的条件的贷款。
