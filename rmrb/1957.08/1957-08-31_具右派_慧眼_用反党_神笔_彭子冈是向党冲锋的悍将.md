Xinhua News Agency, August 30th: The news work forum held here over the past two days unmasked the deceptive facade of Peng Zigang, editor-in-chief of "Traveler" magazine, who claimed to love the Party, and completely exposed her anti-Party face.

According to revelations by staff from the Beijing offices of Guangming Daily, Wenhui Daily, and Ta Kung Pao, Peng Zigang is a female vanguard of the Rightists attacking the Communist Party on the news front. Peng Zigang had close relationships with Chu Anping, Pu Xixiu, and Rightists Zhu Qiping, Xiao Li, and Xiao Feng of Ta Kung Pao. Peng Zigang actively helped Chu Anping to tamper with the political direction of Guangming Daily and participated in Pu Xixiu's anti-Communist and anti-socialist activities. When the Rightists of Ta Kung Pao launched a frenzied attack on the Ta Kung Pao Party group, they echoed each other with Peng Zigang.

On March 31 this year, on the eve of Chu Anping's appointment as editor-in-chief of Guangming Daily, Peng Zigang and her husband, Xu Ying, invited Chu Anping, Pu Xixiu, and others for secret discussions. They studied the personnel arrangements, newspaper management policies, and layout reorganization of Guangming Daily. Peng Zigang even lost her composure and wanted to write "A Record of the New Editor-in-Chief's Inauguration." By early June, Peng Zigang and Xu Ying had spent nine Sundays out of eleven weeks with Chu Anping. In addition to further planning to tamper with the political direction of Guangming Daily, they also planned to add "Three Evils" cartoons to the newspaper during the National People's Congress session and publish reactionary remarks from the Peking University Democracy Wall,妄想to make a mess of the NPC session, so that people like Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji could clean up the mess.

On June 8, after the People's Daily published the editorial "Why is This?", when Pu Xixiu learned of Chu Anping's resignation, Peng Zigang still vehemently advocated that Wenhui Daily send a special dispatch to continue attacking the Communist Party. Xu Ying advocated waiting to see which way the wind blows, but Peng Zigang expressed strong dissatisfaction.

Gao Ji of the People's Daily revealed that Peng Zigang is an extremely selfish and self-serving person who resorts to despicable means. Back in the days at Ta Kung Pao, another female reporter was forced out by Peng Zigang. This was a progressive female reporter, and Peng Zigang tried everything to make it impossible for her to gain a foothold at Ta Kung Pao. However, Peng Zigang was candid and got along very well with reactionary elements. Before liberation, she was in Beijing and had nothing to hide from a person who served as a colonel in the Kuomintang reactionary army and committed many anti-Communist crimes. She even told this reactionary element about her connection with underground Party comrades.

The forum sharply criticized Peng Zigang's bourgeois journalistic views, exposing her boasted "keen eyes" and "divine pen." She attacked the post-liberation news industry as being good for nothing and cursed current journalists for having no freedom or independent thinking. Her editorial "Respect Journalists" written for Wenhui Daily, ridiculed and cursed the Party's leadership over the news industry to the best of her ability. Peng Zigang praised the old bourgeois newspapers to the skies, and often touted the traditions of the old Ta Kung Pao. On May 20 this year, Peng Zigang wrote an article in Ta Kung Pao entitled "If I Were Still a Reporter," which began by saying: "It's been three years since I was a reporter, and seven or eight years since I used my own news sensitivity and creativity to conduct interviews," meaning that the "news sensitivity and creativity" of Peng Zigang, this "famous reporter," had been completely stifled after national liberation.

The news work forum will continue to expose and criticize Peng Zigang's anti-Party words and deeds.

### 具右派“慧眼”用反党“神笔”　彭子冈是向党冲锋的悍将

    具右派“慧眼”用反党“神笔”
　　彭子冈是向党冲锋的悍将
    据新华社30日讯　过去两天在这里举行的新闻工作座谈会，揭穿了“旅行家”杂志主编彭子冈自称爱护党的迷惑人的假面具，把她的反党面目完全暴露出来。
    据光明日报、文汇报北京办事处和大公报的工作人员揭露，彭子冈是右派分子在新闻战线上向共产党进攻的一员女悍将。彭子冈和储安平，浦熙修以及大公报右派分子朱启平、肖离、肖凤等人有密切关系。彭子冈曾积极帮助储安平篡改光明日报的政治方向，参与浦熙修反共反社会主义的活动，大公报的右派分子向大公报党组猖狂进攻时，和彭子冈彼此呼应。
    今年3月31日，储安平就任光明日报总编辑前夕，彭子冈和他的丈夫徐盈，邀储安平、浦熙修等人密商。他们研究了光明日报的人事安排，办报方针和版面改组等事项。彭子冈甚至得意忘形地要写“新总编辑上任记”。到6月上旬为止，彭子冈与徐盈在十一个星期中就有九个星期天与储安平在一起，他们除进一步策划篡改光明日报政治方向外，还计划在全国人民代表大会开会期间在报面上增添“三害”漫画，刊登北大民主墙的反动言论，妄想把人代大会搞得乱糟糟，然后由章伯钧、罗隆基之流来收拾场面。
      6月8日，人民日报发表“这是为什么”的社论后，浦熙修获悉储安平辞职消息，彭子冈仍竭力主张文汇报发专电，继续向共产党进攻。徐盈主张看看风头再说，彭子冈表示强烈的不满。
    人民日报高集揭发，彭子冈是一个极端自私自利，玩弄卑劣手段的人。当年在大公报的另一个女记者就是被彭子冈逼走的。这是一个进步的女记者，彭子冈想尽一切办法，叫她在大公报无法立足。但是彭子冈对于反动分子却开诚相见，相处得十分融洽。解放前，她在北京和一个在国民党反动军队中担任过上校职位，干过许多反共罪行的人物，无话不谈。甚至她同地下党同志联系的关系，也告诉了这个反动分子。
    座谈会尖锐地批判了彭子冈的资产阶级新闻观点。揭穿了她所吹嘘的“慧眼”和“神笔”。她攻击解放后的新闻事业一无是处，诅咒现在的新闻记者没有自由、没有独立思考。她给文汇报写的“尊重新闻记者”社论，对于党对新闻事业的领导，极尽嬉笑怒骂之能事。彭子冈对资产阶级的旧报纸歌颂备至，经常向人鼓吹旧大公报的传统。今年5月20日，彭子冈在大公报上写了一篇“假如我还当记者”一文，开头就说：“不当记者三年了，不凭自己的新闻敏感和创造性去采访已有七、八年了”，意思就是说彭子冈这位“名记者”的“新闻敏感和创造性”在全国解放以后就被扼杀得干干净净了。
    新闻工作座谈会将继续揭露和批判彭子冈的反党言行。
