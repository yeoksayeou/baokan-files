    Matters Have Primary and Secondary Aspects, Things Have Roots and Branches
    Tang Tao
    After reading the miscellaneous essays written by rightist elements within the Party, such as Wang Ruowang, since the start of the blooming and contending, the breadth of topics covered and the absurdity of viewpoints are truly astounding. While criticizing Wang Zhong's reactionary journalistic views, it occurred to me that Wang Ruowang also has a systematic view of newspapers and periodicals, which is completely consistent with the news viewpoints of newspapers run by American financial groups.
    The bourgeoisie once heavily promoted their news viewpoint, openly declaring under the guise of sensationalism and mystery: "Dog bites man is not news, man bites dog is news." In a society like the United States, large capitalists monopolize enterprises, use money to buy off politicians, and cultivate power, so that workers in the slums of New York live in houses without roofs, and farmers in the Salinas River Valley are displaced, while a few capitalists reap profits without labor and have millions in wealth. This is the "American way of life" under exploitation and rule, which has become the norm in that society, just like "dog bites man," a common occurrence, not considered "news"; if a worker is able to work hard and diligently throughout their life and "climb up," this is "man bites dog," "news" worthy of great fanfare. And this kind of "news" becomes a powerful tool for whitewashing their world.
    Applying the same news viewpoint to our society naturally requires reversing the tone. For example: saying that the sun is bright and shining is not news; it is necessary to point out the sunspots in the sun, and exaggerate these sunspots, to be considered "news"; saying that people's lives have improved, are stable and prosperous, is not news; it is necessary to "look for bones in tofu," as the saying goes, find individual households short of food, and exaggerate them, to be considered "news." But what role does this kind of "news" play in our society? Obviously, this is completely contrary to the reality of life and conforms to the bourgeois anti-Party, anti-socialist conspiracy's "news."
    Let's see what Wang Ruowang said. Wang Ruowang said that the atmosphere for criticizing shortcomings "was almost non-existent in the past, so newspapers became monotonous and one-sided, 'reporting only good news, not bad news.' Now there are more articles pointing out our shortcomings and mistakes, and this approach only has advantages and no disadvantages. First, the masses like to read it, even the old workers like to read it, because our newspapers are closer to the truth; second, newspapers openly criticize our shortcomings, which has a great promoting effect on improving work and enhancing the people's supervision of the government and the Party." (See "Wrong") We do not shy away from mistakes and shortcomings in our work, and we welcome all well-intentioned criticisms and supervision, now and in the past. Wang Ruowang believes that our past newspapers "reported only good news, not bad news," and were not "truthful," which is nonsense. In fact, what Wang Ruowang himself demands is not truth. When talking about the policy of publications, he said: "It is unnecessary to stipulate in advance what is the keynote and mainstream; if it is not done well, it will become a restrictive rule that hinders the blooming of a hundred flowers." (See "Defending Step by Step") Doesn't this mean that it is only necessary to talk about the sunspots in the sun, and not necessary to say that the sun is bright and shining, which is the bourgeois view of newspapers and periodicals? Wang Ruowang encourages people to criticize mistakes and shortcomings, while opposing the keynote and mainstream. This intention is very malicious.
    We are moving forward, and mistakes and shortcomings are inevitable in the process of moving forward. Through criticism, mistakes and shortcomings can be corrected. However, only by understanding the keynote and mainstream can we give a proper estimate to the tributaries and trivial matters; only by seeing the sun's bright and shining light can we talk about ways to deal with sunspots.
    Matters have primary and secondary aspects, and things have roots and branches. This is the key to distinguishing right from wrong; applied to newspaper work, it is also the dividing line between us and the bourgeois news viewpoint. August 11th

    事有主次，物有本末
    唐弢
    翻阅了党内右派分子王若望鸣放以来所写的杂文，它所涉及的范围之广、观点之荒谬，实在是到了惊人的地步。在批判王中的反动新闻观点的同时，使我想到，王若望的对于报刊，也有他一套系统的看法，这种看法，和美国财阀集团所办报纸的新闻观点是完全一致的。
    资产阶级曾经大事宣传他们的新闻观点，在猎奇、探秘的幌子下，公然宣称：“狗咬人不算新闻，人咬狗才是新闻。”在像美国那样的社会里，大资本家垄断企业，利用金钱来收卖政客，培植势力，使纽约贫民窟的工人住着没有屋顶的房子，使萨里那斯河流域的农民流连失所，而少数资本家却不劳而获，腰缠百万，这是剥削统治下的“美国生活方式”，已经成为那个社会的规律，就像“狗咬人”一样，司空见惯，算不得什么“新闻”了；如果居然有工人能够辛辛苦苦勤勤恳恳地工作一生，“爬了上去”，这才是“人咬狗”，值得大书特书的“新闻”。而这种“新闻”，也就成为粉饰他们天下的有力的工具。
    同样的新闻观点一应用到我们这个社会里，就自然而然地要反一调。例如：说太阳光明灿烂就不算新闻，一定要指出太阳里有黑点，而且夸大这黑点，才算是“新闻”；说人民生活有了改善，安定富裕，不算新闻，一定要像俗语所谓“豆腐里寻骨头”，找出个别缺粮户，加以渲染，才算是“新闻”。但是，如此等等的“新闻”，在我们这个社会里又起了什么作用呢？很显然，这是完全背离了生活的真实，符合于资产阶级反党、反社会主义阴谋的“新闻”。
    且看王若望是怎样说的吧。王若望说，批评缺点的气氛“过去几乎没有，因此报纸就成了‘报喜不报忧’的单调的片面性的报纸，现在指出我们缺点和错误的文章多起来了，这种做法只有好处，没有坏处。第一，群众喜欢看，连老工人也喜欢看，因为我们的报纸更接近真实了；第二，报纸公开批评我们的缺点，对改进工作，提高人民对政府、对党的监督有很大的推动作用。”（见“不对头”）我们并不讳言工作中的错误和缺点，欢迎一切善意的批评和监督，现在如此，过去也如此。王若望认为我们过去的报纸“报喜不报忧”，都不“真实”，这是胡说。其实王若望自己要求的倒不是什么真实，他在谈到刊物方针的时候说：“预先规定什么是基调和主流，是不必要的，弄得不好就会成为妨碍百花齐放的清规戒律。”（见“步步设防”）难道这不就是说只要谈太阳里有黑点、而不必说太阳是光明灿烂的资产阶级的报刊观点吗？王若望鼓励人家批评错误和缺点，一面又反对基调和主流，这种用意是十分恶毒的。
    我们正在前进，在前进中难免有错误和缺点，通过批评可以把错误和缺点改正过来。但是，只有懂得了基调和主流，才能给支流末节以一个适当的估计；只有看清楚太阳的光明灿烂，才足与言对付黑点的办法。
    事有主次，物有本末，这是明辨是非的关键；应用在报刊工作上，也正是我们和资产阶级新闻观点的分歧点。  8月11日
