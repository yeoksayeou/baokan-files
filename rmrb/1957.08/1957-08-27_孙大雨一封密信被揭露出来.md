Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 25th: A secret letter written by Sun Dayu to Gu Zhizhong was read out at a group meeting of the Shanghai Municipal People's Congress on the 24th.

This secret letter was handed over by Gu Zhizhong. The letter was written on February 23rd of this year. In the letter, Sun Dayu told Gu that he had created "a nationwide counter-revolutionary group with Shanghai as its main base in the fields of culture, education, and united front work." He had already publicly named several "key members" in higher education, in front of more than a thousand people at the Shanghai Municipal People's Political Consultative Conference at the end of last year. Sun Dayu said in the letter: "The battle is not yet over." "There are two comrades-in-arms here, one naive and childish, the other weak and muddled, almost used by the enemy. Fortunately, I am determined to persevere, and several other comrades-in-arms are encouraging me, so I have not wavered in the slightest." "If you were in Shanghai, you could fight alongside me and establish revolutionary merit." Sun Dayu also informed Gu Zhizhong in the letter that a person Gu had mentioned to him before leaving Shanghai had been decided to be included in the "counter-revolutionary group" after his research. Sun Dayu also wanted Gu Zhizhong to provide him with materials about Qi Qisheng and Zhou Xuliang (two university professors whom Sun Dayu falsely accused of being members of the counter-revolutionary group). Sun Dayu stated that he was "ready to go through fire and water" to realize this conspiracy. He also enclosed in this letter a copy of his speech at the Municipal People's Political Consultative Conference in which he falsely accused good people of being counter-revolutionaries, asking Gu Zhizhong to "show it to reliable revolutionary comrades, but do not show it to others easily."

People's representatives questioned Sun Dayu, besides Gu Zhizhong, who else in the rightist group supported him in slandering good people? Who did he refer to as "comrades-in-arms" who supported him, and "reliable revolutionary comrades" in the letter? At the meeting, Sun Dayu initially only admitted to sending the speech at the People's Political Consultative Conference to Gu Zhizhong, but denied writing the letter. After the letter was exposed on the spot, he stammered in response to the representatives' questioning, admitting that the "naive and childish, weak and muddled" "comrades-in-arms" he mentioned referred to Fudan University professors Zhang Mengwen and Chen Zizhan, and the "comrades-in-arms" who encouraged him were rightist backbone elements Wang ZaoShi and Fudan University Library curator Pan Shizi, "and no one else." His speech at the Municipal People's Political Consultative Conference slandering good people had been jointly studied with Wang ZaoShi, Peng Wenyin, Zhang Mengwen, and Chen Zizhan beforehand. Last year, he showed his "secret accusation letter" of more than 80,000 words to Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai that slandered good people to Luo Longji beforehand.

Lu Yi, a member of the Zhang-Luo alliance's rightist group in Shanghai, immediately reminded Sun Dayu, "I was also your close comrade-in-arms. Have you forgotten? You have many close comrades-in-arms, including Luo Longji's confidant Zhao Wenbi. If you don't confess further, I can expose you immediately." At this point, Sun Dayu had no choice but to admit that his "comrades-in-arms" also included Peng Wenyin, Lu Yi, Wang Hengshou, and Ding Xue, among others.

At the meeting, rightist Zhang Mengwen confessed that when he participated in the study of Sun Dayu's blacklist, he expressed his approval of the inclusion of Chen Qi Wu, the director of the Shanghai Higher Education Bureau, and five others. Representatives also revealed that after Peng Wenyin saw the "blacklist," he gave Sun Dayu strategic guidance, telling him to narrow the scope of attack first and concentrate on attacking some "sure targets." Sun Dayu's "secret accusation letter" was not only shown to Luo Longji in Beijing, but Pu Xixiu and Zeng Zhaolun also knew about it.

　　孙大雨一封密信被揭露出来
    据新华社上海25日电　上海市人代会分组会议在24日宣读了孙大雨写给顾执中的一封密信。
    这一封密信是顾执中交出来的。写信的日子是今年2月23日。孙大雨在信上告诉顾，他制造了“一个全国性而以上海为大本营的文教和统战方面的反革命集团”，他在去年年底的上海市政协会上已当着一千多人公开提名叫出其中高等教育方面的几个“骨干分子”。孙大雨在信上说：“现在战斗尚未结束”，“此间有两个战友，一个天真幼稚，一个软弱糊涂，几乎为敌人所用，幸亏我誓志坚持，而且另有几个战友鼓气，所以丝毫未曾动摇。”“兄若在沪，当可和我一同作战，建立革命大功。”孙大雨还在信上通知顾执中，顾在离上海前向他说到过的一个人，经他研究后已决定列入“反革命集团”。孙大雨还要顾执中供给他关于漆琪生和周煦良（被孙大雨诬指为反革命集团分子的两位大学教授）的材料。孙大雨表示，为实现这一阴谋他“赴汤蹈火，在所不辞”。他在这封信中还附寄一份他自己在市政协会上诬蔑好人为反革命分子的发言稿，要顾执中“给可靠的革命同志看，但不要轻易示人。”
    人民代表们质问孙大雨，除顾执中外，右派集团中支持他诬害好人的还有谁？他在信上称为“战友”、为他鼓气的“战友”、“可靠的革命同志”指谁？孙大雨在会上起初只承认把政协会上的发言稿寄给顾执中，不承认还写了信。当这封信被当场揭露出来后，他在代表们的追问下才吞吞吐吐地承认，他所说的“天真幼稚、软弱糊涂”的“战友”，是指复旦大学教授张孟闻和陈子展，给他鼓气的“战友”有右派骨干分子王造时和复旦大学图书馆馆长潘世兹，“再没有别人了”。他在市政协会上的诬害好人的发言稿事先和王造时、彭文应、张孟闻、陈子展共同研究过。去年他写给毛主席、周总理的八万多字的诬害好人的“密告信”，事先给罗隆基看过。
    章罗联盟在上海的右派集团分子陆诒当即提示孙大雨说：“我也曾是你的亲密战友你难道忘了吗？你还有许多亲密战友，罗隆基的亲信赵文璧即是其中之一。你再不交代，我可以马上揭露你。”这时，孙大雨只好承认，他的“战友”还有彭文应、陆诒、王恒守和丁雪等人。
    右派分子张孟闻在会上交代他参与研究孙大雨的黑名单时，曾对其中的上海市高等教育局局长陈其五等六人表示赞同。代表们还揭发：彭文应看了“黑名单”后，曾对孙大雨在策略上加以指导，要他先缩小打击面，集中打击一些“有把握的”。孙大雨的“密告信”在北京不仅给罗隆基看过，浦熙修、曾昭抡也都知道。
