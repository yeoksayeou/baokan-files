    "Special League Members"
    Among the new members developed by the Chongqing Municipal Organization of the China Democratic League (CDL) in colleges and universities from September of last year to May of this year, the rightists who have been identified account for 15% of the new members. In particular, a group of "special league members" "appointed" by the Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji clique, who joined the league without going through legitimate organizational procedures, are all ferocious rightists.

    Shu Jun, the organization minister of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, actively implemented Zhang Luo's policy of large-scale development. In the past six months or so, the CDL's development of league members has disregarded political history and ideology, and even organizational procedures have been dispensed with. Those who had been spies or had close collusion with spies, and the backbone elements of reactionary parties such as the Kuomintang, the Three People's Principles Youth League, and the Youth Party, have all been pulled into the league.

    The newly developed "special league member" Liu Shengya is a leading figure of the CDL's right-wing group in Chongqing's literary and art circles. He colludes with rightists everywhere to establish strongholds, expand his influence, and stir up trouble. He openly slanders the leaders of the literary and art circles as "ignorant and incompetent," and smears the Party's leadership of literary and art work as "cannibalistic sectarian rule"; and he actively engages in activities to usurp the leadership of the literary and art circles.

    Another "special league member," Chen Dongyuan, is the strategist of the anti-Party group of Dong Shiguang and Luo Rongzi at Chongqing Southwest Normal College. Even the members of his CDL group did not know when he joined the league. He viciously attacks the school's Party committee system, and also fabricates and spreads "arguments" that the Party committee does not care about the workers, attempting to incite the workers' dissatisfaction with the Party.

    Many of these "special league members" are reactionary elements who have consistently opposed the Communist Party and the people. For example, before liberation, Liu Shengya wrote biographies for warlords and colluded with cultural spies to frame progressive people. (Hu Mingjun)

    “特殊盟员”
    民盟重庆市组织去年9月到今年5月在大专学校发展的新盟员中，已查出的右派分子就占新盟员的15％。特别是章伯钧、罗隆基集团“钦定”的不通过合法组织手续就入盟的一批“特殊盟员”，都是凶狠的右派分子。
    民盟重庆市委组织部长舒军积极执行章罗大发展方针，近半年多来民盟发展盟员已不讲政治历史和思想等条件，有的组织手续也不要了。曾经作过特务或与特务有过密切勾结的人，国民党、三青团、青年党等反动党派的骨干分子，都统统把他们拉进了盟里。
    新发展的“特殊盟员”刘盛亚，是民盟右派集团在重庆文艺界掌大旗的人物。他四处串连右派分子建立据点，扩张势力，并且到处点火。他公开毁谤文艺界的领导“不学无术”，诬蔑党对文艺工作的领导是“吃人的宗派统治”；并积极进行篡夺文艺界领导的活动。
    另一个“特殊盟员”陈东原，是重庆西南师范学院董时光、罗容梓反党集团的军师。他入盟时，连他所在的民盟小组的盟员也不知道。他大肆攻击学校的党委制，还制造和散播党委不关心工人的“论证”，企图煽动工人对党不满。
    这些“特殊盟员”不少是一贯反共反人民的反动分子。如刘盛亚解放前为大军阀写传记，并同文化特务勾结诬陷进步人士。（胡明俊）
