Xinhua News Agency, August 17th: The Ministry of Food held an all-day meeting today to criticize Zhang Naqi, exposing a new batch of materials about his reactionary activities.

In his speech, Yu Jie, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Food, first exposed Zhang Naqi's criminal behavior of using his position to carry out anti-Party activities at the 1956 Grain Bureau Chiefs Conference. He said that at that time, the Party Group proposed that the guiding principle for grain work in 1956 should be "continue to stabilize the grain situation and vigorously improve operation and management." However, Zhang Naqi insisted that this guiding principle was "conservative" and that the main focus should be on improving operation and management. Because his views were completely opposite to those of the Party Group, the work policy could not be confirmed at the Minister's Office meeting at the time. Therefore, the Party Group submitted the Party's policy to the National Grain Bureau Chiefs Conference for discussion. Zhang Naqi was very dissatisfied with this and challenged the Party Group's policy everywhere. He even unreasonably asked Chen Xiyun to make a self-criticism for "conservatism" and attacked Chen Xiyun with extremely vile attitudes and extremely despicable means. But everyone knew that Zhang Naqi was actually frantically attacking the correct policy put forward by the Party Group.

Due to Zhang Naqi's opposition, the policy was not finalized until the meeting was about to end. Later, after reluctantly agreeing, Zhang Naqi used his ministerial powers to obstruct the implementation of this policy in every possible way, delaying the issuance of the summary of the meeting for more than two months. However, Zhang Naqi did not give up. Ignoring the dissenting opinions of the Party Group, he spread blindly optimistic views about the grain situation in his speech at the People's Congress, making cadres slack in their work and causing the masses to demand more grain supply from the state, regardless of actual possibilities. Now, facts have proved that his criminal behavior has had an extremely adverse impact on grain work.

Li Zhuchen, Hu Ziang, Wu Dakun, and Wu Gengmei, vice chairmen and members of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (ACFIC), who were invited to attend the meeting, also spoke at the meeting today. In their speeches, they unanimously pointed out that Zhang Naqi often bragged in the ACFIC about how loyal he was to the Communist Party in the Ministry of Food and how he had "tricks" for leading the work. The revelations and criticisms of Zhang Naqi in the Ministry of Food these days proved that Zhang Naqi was anti-Party and anti-socialist in the ACFIC; and he was also anti-Party and anti-socialist in the Ministry of Food.

Li Zhuchen pointed out that Zhang Naqi was the one who engaged in sectarian activities within the ACFIC, not, as Zhang Naqi said, that "the ACFIC Central Committee has a sectarian organization that ruthlessly attacked him." The recent exposure within the ACFIC Central Committee of Zhang Naqi's small group members, Xu Hansan, Lin Difei, Yang Meizhen, Ding Yuchang, and Dai Jia Yun, revealed Zhang Naqi's conspiracy to organize a small group in an attempt to seize the leadership of the ACFIC to carry out anti-Party and anti-socialist activities more frantically.

In his speech, Hu Ziang said that in the eight years since liberation, Zhang Naqi had tried every possible means to tamper with the political line of the ACFIC, wanting to use the ACFIC as his base for anti-Party and anti-socialist activities. In the early days of liberation, he opposed the policy of "uniting, supporting, educating, and transforming the national bourgeoisie" within the ACFIC. After the announcement of the general line and general task of the state, the ACFIC put forward five standards for its members, and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce put forward five criteria for industrialists and businessmen. Zhang Naqi believed that these were all dogmatism and encouraged the industrial and commercial circles to oppose accepting socialist transformation. At the first National Congress of the ACFIC in 1955, Zhang Naqi put forward the so-called "Red Bourgeois Political Party issue." After the CPC proposed the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," he repeatedly emphasized the organizational independence and political freedom of democratic parties, more blatantly opposing the democratic parties' acceptance of the Communist Party's leadership.

Hu Ziang said: Zhang Naqi not only took every opportunity to stir up trouble everywhere, but also used small groups from the central to the local levels to organize forces to attack the Communist Party. There was a small group in the ACFIC Central Committee, led by him personally; there were small groups in Shanghai led by Wang Junliang and Wang Zijian; there was a small group in Tianjin led by rightist Bi Mingqi; there was a small group in Beijing led by Zhang Huanyao and Wu Jincui; there was a small group in Hangzhou led by Shen Jiru; there was a small group in Wuhan led by Wang Yiming and Li Wujiu; and there was a small group in Guangzhou led by Chen Zubei. Some of these small groups were organized under Zhang Naqi's direct instructions; some were contacted and arranged through members of the right-wing small group in the ACFIC Central Committee; and some were formed based on Zhang Naqi's "theories" and "programs." Zhang Naqi used these groups to peddle his private goods in the industrial and commercial circles, inciting the industrial and commercial circles to resist transformation and oppose the leadership of the Communist Party.

Wu Dakun listed many facts to show that Zhang Naqi was consistently anti-Communist. He said that on March 10, 1940, Zhang Naqi wrote a Sunday essay in the Dagongbao entitled "The Way of Unity, the Way of Nation-Building," publicly supporting Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary slogan of "one government, one party, one leader." Zhang Naqi's article paved the way for the Kuomintang reactionaries' Southern Anhui Incident.

Finally, Chen Guodong, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Food and Secretary of the Party Group, announced on behalf of the Rectification Leadership Group of the Ministry of Food that the meeting held by the Ministry of Food to expose and criticize Zhang Naqi was temporarily coming to an end today. He then criticized Zhang Naqi's two "self-criticisms" at the meeting and pointed out that Zhang Naqi's reactionary thoughts were systematic and his methods were insidious. The most vicious thing was that he used his legitimate position as Minister of the Ministry of Food and Vice Chairman of the ACFIC to openly distort Marxist-Leninist theory and the Party's policies, and promote his anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks. He said that Zhang Naqi insidiously and viciously undermined the Party's prestige, competed with the Party for the masses, competed with the Party for leadership, and openly challenged the Party. Isn't this the biggest political ambition and political conspiracy?

Chen Guodong warned Zhang Naqi: "You have now reached a dangerous situation. You should break all illusions, dig out the old roots of your bourgeois reactionary nature, and honestly confess all your anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds to the people of the whole country, and start a new life." Chen Guodong said, "Our Party has always been kind and helpful, curing diseases to save people. As long as you show repentance, we are willing to help you in various ways. If you still do not repent, we will resolutely fight you to the end."

### 粮食部批判章乃器大会告一段落  章乃器反共一面性已众目昭彰

    粮食部批判章乃器大会告一段落
    章乃器反共一面性已众目昭彰
    据新华社17日讯　粮食部今天全天举行批判章乃器的大会，对章乃器的反动活动又揭发出一批新的材料。
    粮食部副部长喻杰在发言中，首先揭穿了章乃器在1956年粮食厅局长会议上利用职权，进行反党活动的罪恶行为。他说，当时，党组提出1956年粮食工作的方针应该是“继续稳定粮食局势，大力改善经营管理”，章乃器却一口咬定这条方针是“保守”的，主要的应该放在改善经营管理上。因为他和党组的看法完全相反，当时在部长办公会议上，不能把工作方针肯定下来。因而，党组把党的方针提交到全国粮食厅局长会议上进行讨论。章乃器对此很不满意，处处向党组的这条方针挑战。他甚至无理地要陈希云检讨“保守主义”，并用极其恶劣的态度和极其卑鄙的手段攻击陈希云。但是谁都知道，章乃器实际上是在猖狂的攻击党组提出的正确方针。
    由于章乃器的反对，直到会议快要结束的时候，方针还未最后定下来。后来章乃器在勉强同意以后，又利用部长职权，百般地阻挠这个方针的实现，他把这个会议的总结拖延了两个多月才签发出去。但是，章乃器还没有心死，他竟然不顾党组的不同意见，又在人民代表大会上的发言中，散布对于粮食局势的盲目乐观情绪，使干部在工作中麻痹松劲，使群众不顾实际可能要求国家多供应粮食。现在事实证明，他的罪恶行为，对粮食工作起了极其不利的影响。
    被邀请参加会议的民建会和全国工商联副主委李烛尘、胡子昂、民建中委吴大琨、吴羹梅，今天也在会上发了言。他们在发言中一致指出，章乃器经常在民建会内吹嘘他在粮食部如何对共产党忠心耿耿，领导工作如何有“窍门”，经过粮食部这几天的揭发和批判，证明章乃器在民建会、工商联是反党反社会主义的；在粮食部也同样是反党反社会主义的。
    李烛尘指出，在民建内部搞宗派活动的是章乃器，而不是章乃器所说的“民建中央有宗派组织，向他作无情打击”。最近民建中央机关内部揭露出来的章乃器小集团成员许汉三、林涤非、杨美真、丁裕长、戴家澐等人，暴露了章乃器组织小集团的阴谋，是企图夺取民建会的领导权，以便更疯狂地进行反党反社会主义活动。
    胡子昂在发言中说，解放后八年来，章乃器千方百计地企图篡改民建会的政治路线，想把民建会作为他反党、反社会主义的基地。解放初期，他就在民建会内反对“团结、扶助、教育、改造民族资产阶级”的方针。在国家总路线、总任务公布后，民建会提出对会员的五项标准，全国工商联提出对工商业者的五项准则，章乃器认为这些都是教条主义，鼓动工商界反对接受社会主义改造。1955年民建会召开第一次全国代表大会，章乃器又提出所谓“红色资产阶级政党问题。中共提出“长期共存、互相监督”的方针后，他一再强调民主党派组织独立，政治自由，更加露骨地反对民主党派接受共产党的领导。
    胡子昂说：章乃器不仅利用一切机会到处点火，还从中央到地方利用小集团，组织力量向共产党进攻。在民建中央有一个小集团，由他亲自领导；上海有汪君良、王子健等人的小集团；天津有以右派分子毕鸣岐为首的小集团，北京有以张焕尧、吴金萃为首的小集团；杭州有以沈九如为首的小集团；武汉有以王一鸣、厉无咎为首的小集团；广州有以陈祖沛为首的小集团。这些小集团有的是在章乃器直接指使下组织起来的；有的是通过民建中央的右派小集团的成员去联系、布置的；有的是根据章乃器的“理论”“纲领”形成的。章乃器利用这些集团，在工商界中贩卖他的私货，鼓动工商界抗拒改造，反对共产党的领导。
    吴大琨列举了许多事实说明章乃器是一贯反共的。他说，章乃器1940年3月10日曾在大公报上写了一篇以“团结之道，建国之道”为题的星期论文，公开拥护蒋介石提出的“一个政府，一个党，一个领袖”的反动口号。章乃器的这篇文章恰好为国民党反动派所发动的皖南事变铺平了道路。
    最后，粮食部副部长、党组书记陈国栋代表粮食部的整风领导小组宣布，粮食部举行的揭发批判章乃器大会，今天暂时告一段落。他接着批判了章乃器在这个大会上的两次“检讨”，并指出章乃器的反动思想是有系统的，手法是阴险的。最恶毒的是他利用粮食部部长、民建会和工商联副主任委员的合法地位，公开歪曲马克思列宁主义理论和党的政策，宣传他的反党反社会主义言论。他说，章乃器阴险恶毒的破坏党的威信，同党争取群众，同党争夺领导权，公开向党挑战，这难道不是最大的政治野心、政治阴谋吗？
    陈国栋警告章乃器说：“你现在已经走到危险的境地，应当打破一切幻想，把你的资产阶级反动本质的老根子挖掉，老老实实地把你的全部反党、反社会主义言行向全国人民彻底交代，重新做人。”陈国栋说：“我们党是一贯与人为善，治病救人的，只要你有悔过的表示，我们是愿意用各种方式帮助你的。如果你仍不悔悟，我们将同你坚决斗争到底。”
