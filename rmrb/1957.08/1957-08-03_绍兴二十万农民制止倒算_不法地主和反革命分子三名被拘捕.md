(Our newspaper's Hangzhou dispatch, August 2nd) Reporter Liu Fan reports: 200,000 farmers in Shaoxing County, Zhejiang Province, have angrily fought back against the words and deeds of unlawful landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries seeking to settle old scores.

In a township north of the county, a landlord openly said, "Collectivization has no advantages, and land ownership certificates must be reclaimed," and incited commune members to withdraw from the commune. A counter-revolutionary element in Fusheng Township even took steps to attempt to undermine the agricultural cooperative. He said, "First, strike down the cadres, then crush the central cooperative, and then sweep away the general cooperatives." A landlord surnamed Zhang in a mountain village even asked farmers to return the boat confiscated during the land reform. A landlord surnamed Tian in Fusheng Township demanded the return of houses distributed during the land reform and even resorted to violence.

The farmers of Shaoxing County fiercely fought back against the frenzied attacks of these bad elements. Cadres and the masses raised their awareness and clarified the lines of demarcation in the struggle. Some deputy directors and directors of Silin Township were initially passive and afraid of difficulties, intending to resign; now, most of them have expressed their determination to lead commune members on the socialist road. Due to the instigation of bad elements, members of the Hushang Cooperative United Brigade in Jianhu Township had dispersed their farm tools, but they have now returned all the tools to the cooperative. In the struggle, many commune members have requested the government to suppress all bad elements who sabotage the socialist cause. In late July, the County Public Security Bureau lawfully arrested three unlawful landlords and counter-revolutionaries with serious crimes, including Tian Chuntao and Ni Yisheng.

    绍兴二十万农民制止倒算
    不法地主和反革命分子三名被拘捕
    本报杭州2日电　记者刘凡报道：浙江绍兴县二十万农民愤怒反击了不法地主、富农和反革命分子倒算的言行。
    该县?北乡的地主公开说“合作化没有优越性，要收回土地证”，并煽动社员退社。富盛乡的反革命分子还采取步骤，妄图搞垮农业社。他说：“先把干部打下去，再把中心社搞垮，然后把一般社一扫而光。”山乡一个姓张的地主竟向农民提出要归还土改中没收的船。富盛乡田姓地主向农民索夺土改中被分掉的房子，并动手打人。
    绍兴县农民对这些坏分子的疯狂进攻，给予了猛烈的回击。干部和群众在斗争中提高了觉悟，划清了界限。四林乡有些正副社主任原先消极畏难，打算辞职；现在大部分人表示坚决领导社员走社会主义道路。鉴湖乡壶觞社联合大队社员因坏分子挑拨，分散了农具，现在已将农具全部归社。在斗争中，许多社员纷纷要求政府镇压一切破坏社会主义事业的坏分子。7月下旬，县公安局依法拘捕了有严重罪行的不法地主和反革命分子田春陶、倪益生等三名。
