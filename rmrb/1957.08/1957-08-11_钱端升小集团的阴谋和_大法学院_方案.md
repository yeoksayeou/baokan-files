The matter of Qian Duansheng's anti-socialist activities was something I learned about in the newspapers. As for Lou Bangyan's and Wang Tieya's anti-Party statements, I not only heard them firsthand at rectification discussion meetings, but I had also engaged in heated debates with them more than once, well before the rectification movement. With such bold and ferocious rightist vanguards like Wang Tieya and Lou Bangyan, there must be an equally bold and ferocious anti-Party conspirator like Qian Duansheng. As a comrade from the Jiusan Society aptly put it: Lou Bangyan and Wang Tieya are like the Heng and Ha generals before the rightist hall – describing these two "celebrated scholars'" attack on the Party as "both bold and ferocious" is most fitting.

Since Qian Duansheng and others have walked a long anti-Party road and are unwilling to reform themselves, then under the new conditions, they are bound to expose their new anti-socialist conspiracies.

Wang Tieya's and Lou Bangyan's bold and ferocious statements reflect the conspiracy of the Qian Duansheng clique, which is to overthrow the new departments established after the 1952 "restructuring of colleges and departments" and establish a "Grand Law School."

I have heard news of "readjusting the departments" three times. Once, Lou Bangyan said it, advocating merging the law departments of the National People's Congress and Peking University into the College of Political Science and Law. Another time, Wang Tieya said it, advocating merging the law department of the National People's Congress into Peking University. The third time, Wang Tieya and Lou Bangyan said it together, that Qian Duansheng wanted to create a grand school of political science and law like the "London School of Economics and Political Science." As everyone knows, the London School of Economics and Political Science was founded by British right-wing socialists such as Webb, Wells, and Laski, and is affiliated with the University of London in its organizational system and disseminates bourgeois reformism in its ideological system. According to Qian Duansheng's plan, which will never be realized, the "Grand Law School" would similarly be affiliated with Peking University.

For them, this "plan" is "well-founded and reasonable." Since "Renmin University is a hotbed of dogmatism," "the Central School of Political Science and Law Cadres is a sectarian old hen," and "the Law Department of Peking University is a hodgepodge of Renmin University and the Central Cadre School," then, indeed, it behooves "celebrated scholars" like Qian Duansheng, Wang Tieya, and Lou Bangyan to painstakingly overthrow them all and start anew. If so, then Qian Duansheng becoming the vice-president and dean, Lou Bangyan becoming the dean of studies, and Wang Tieya becoming the director of general affairs would be the inevitable logical result.

If this strange plan were to become a reality, what consequences would it have? According to Wang Tieya's proposal: First, greatly reduce the number of courses! "People's Democratic State Law" should be abolished! "Soviet State Law" should be listed as an elective! "Bourgeois State Law" should be taught in the same way as before liberation! "Chinese State Law" has too many problems and should be taught by Lou Bangyan! All of what "Land Law," "Labor Law," and "Cooperative Law" are all unnecessary! Second, separate "International Law" from the law department and international relations history from the history department to make them independent, abolish the Foreign Affairs College and the Institute of International Relations, and establish a large "Department of International Relations" as part of the "Grand Law School," to be headed by Wang Tieya, gathering all international law scholars in the country at Peking University. They believe that this would allow them to catch up with the world's advanced level, that is, the level of bourgeois jurisprudence, in twelve years.

It must be pointed out that the purpose of this "Grand Law School" plan is not merely to overthrow the new departments and take the path of bourgeois jurisprudence. The "Grand Law School" is merely a tool and weapon for them to engage in politics. Their real plan is to overthrow the Communist Party – to overthrow the Communist Party's leadership in the political and legal and diplomatic fields – through "blooming and contending" or through the podium after the establishment of the "Grand Law School." This is the big article written by the Qian Duansheng clique.

What "conditions" do they rely on?

They, as Zhang Bojun said, are all "people who study politics." They "studied" Premier Zhou's report "On the Question of Intellectuals," and thought they were "remarkable," thinking that "the tasks of intellectuals are becoming clearer day by day" and that there was much to be done. The occurrence of the Hungarian incident last year strengthened their illusions, and they thought they had an opportunity when the Party organization carried out the rectification movement this year. Thus, this group of rightists, blinded by greed, regarded the absolute superiority of the proletariat as an absolute disadvantage, thinking that their "opportunity" had come. Wang Tieya berated the Party's leadership in school work: "So many titles and such emphasis on titles have appeared in academic and educational circles, which is really surprising... It seems that what is valued is not articles and morality, but positions and titles. It's simply like a government office." However, it is they themselves who value titles. They use the title of scholar as a weapon to conspire against the Party. Wang Tieya said that Qian Duansheng would at least be a vice-president when he returned to Peking University. Wang Tieya scolded the Party, saying that the College of Political Science and Law was narrow-minded and did not give Fei Qing a full-fledged dean of studies. Qian Duansheng even publicly stated that he had fought for Lou Bangyan to get the title of deputy director of a teaching and research section. Lou Bangyan himself also said that the old professors of the College of Political Science and Law were divided into three classes: Lei Jieqiong, Yan Jingyao, and Rui Mu were in the first class, and they had the titles of director or deputy director; Lou Bangyan himself was in the second class, participating in teaching but without the title of director; others were in the third class, "relegated to the cold palace" (referring to old professors who were not participating in teaching at the time but were studying in the research office). It must be pointed out that their doing so was certainly not for a "dean of studies." Their intention far exceeded the pursuit of "titles" – this group of people wanted to seize leadership and engage in a "second thorough reform." They chorused that old teachers were suppressed and that individual abilities were not being brought into full play. They claim that today's political and legal education is "a complete mess," that "legal science is backward," and that "no one is in charge of scientific research work." All of this, in their view, is the evil consequence of dogmatically learning from the Soviet Union. They unanimously believe that there were "deviations" in judicial reform and that the restructuring of colleges and departments scattered the old teachers "into pieces." They wantonly spread rumors: "The roots of bureaucracy and sectarianism are in Dong Lao" (referring to Comrade Dong Biwu). They cursed the entire political and legal leadership: "Conservative, sectarian." They sophistically argued for the particularity of law, saying that emphasizing the class nature of law was an excuse for sectarianists, with the aim of "closing the door," "monopolizing," and "excluding old people." Thus, they began to value old teachers whom they had always looked down upon, wanting all the old legal personnel to "return to the ranks" and "take the stage" again. Even the "legislative members," puppet military and political personnel, hooligans, and secret agents who had sneaked into universities before liberation became "senior intellectuals" in their eyes. Wang Tieya once clamored in a domineering tone: "Now, as long as senior intellectuals take the initiative to express their desire to go there, they can go there. This is the central government's decision." From this, it can be seen that after Premier Zhou's report on the question of intellectuals came out, Qian Duansheng, Wang Tieya, and Lou Bangyan were carrying out the sinister activities of the Zhang-Luo alliance of the China Democratic League to win over intellectuals.

As the People's Daily editorial said, why do reactionary class enemies throw themselves into the net? "Blinded by greed." Greed meaning seizing power. Considering Qian Duansheng's ambition, more than just the head of a school, - how humble! Reactionary fellows, blinded by greed, lit fires everywhere, thinking that they would ignite with one touch, thinking that the proletarian dictatorship they so deeply hated was about to end. It was under these ideological circumstances that the class anger suppressed in their hearts for eight years burst out and burned us. The great exposure during the rectification movement was nothing more than seizing a large amount of their real evidence. The series of conspiratorial activities they carried out during this rectification movement was the impact of long-standing, accumulated class anger.

Lou Bangyan and Wang Tieya were originally Qian Duansheng's favorite students. Lou Bangyan once served as a colonel instructor in Hu Zongnan's bandit army camp, while Wang Tieya was single-mindedly pursuing the position of director of the Kuomintang Ministry of Foreign Affairs. During the People's Liberation War, Lou Bangyan offered a plan to Chiang Kai-shek, saying that to engage in a constitution, (constitutional governance) must first quell the rebellion. Quelling the rebellion meant eliminating the Communist Party (see "Observation," Volume 3, Issue 1, "Mobilization, Quelling the Rebellion, and Constitutional Governance"). On the eve of the People's Liberation War achieving victory throughout the country, when Shenyang was besieged, Wang Tieya, Lou Bangyan, and others even ran to the Northeast to do "work to stabilize people's hearts," euphemistically calling it "lecturing," attempting to save the dying fate of the reactionaries.

They were indeed ambitious. On the eve of the liberation of Beijing, at Wang Tieya's home, Lou Bangyan and Wang Tieya secretly discussed the question of "who would sit in the chair of the People's Political Consultative Conference." Lou Bangyan revealed their common ambition: "Whether we have a share in the political arena in this lifetime depends entirely on this move." It was this despicable bourgeois political ambition that, after liberation, drove them to use every trick to deceive the Party's trust in them, so as to complete their dirty task of opposing the Communist Party and the people, which they had not completed before liberation: to defeat the Party's leadership over the national regime from within.

I warned Lou Bangyan long ago to sever his foolish and sinful relationship with Qian Duansheng, telling him: "Qian Duansheng's 'pulling you back' from the Bureau of Justice is a subjective fantasy that will never be realized." Now, the truth has come to light, and the matter is not only something that will never be realized, but also an unspeakable conspiracy. It should be told to this group of people that our Party is a powerful advanced force of the working class, not any "sectarianism"; our new universities are sunny academic gardens of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," not any "government office"; our political and legal departments are loyal guardians of the people's democratic dictatorship and young pioneers on the socialist theoretical front, not any "hotbed of dogmatism" or any "sectarian old hen." Your conspiracy has gone bankrupt.

Now, Qian Duansheng, the ringleader, has already begun to admit his crimes. At the Second Session of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Congress, he said that he "had the ambition to usurp the leadership of the College of Political Science and Law, and further developed the ambition to usurp the leadership of the political and legal departments, which is also the objective law of development." However, he still does not dare to admit the conspiracy of the "Grand Law School" plan with sincerity and courage. In this regard, it remains to be seen whether Lou Bangyan and Wang Tieya have sincerity and courage. I believe that explaining specific problems specifically is the only way to save oneself and others. The Qian Duansheng clique must be crushed, and it must be crushed, because the contradiction between it and the people has reached the point of irreconcilability. It has to be crushed, and it has been crushed. This is also the objective law of development. The problem is only time and conditions.

    钱端升小集团的阴谋和“大法学院”方案
    龚祥瑞
    关于钱端升反社会主义的事，我是在报上见到的。至于楼邦彦和王铁崖的反党言论，则不但在整风座谈会上亲聆又亲聆了，而且远在整风之前我就曾不只一次地和他们发生过热烈的争辩。既有王铁崖、楼邦彦这样大胆凶恶的右派急先锋，必有钱端升那样大胆凶恶的反党阴谋家。九三学社的一个同志说得好：楼邦彦和王铁崖正像右派大殿前的哼、哈二将，——以之形容这两个“名流学者”对党的进攻，“既大胆又凶恶”，这是最恰当不过的了。
    钱端升等人既走过漫长的反党的道路，又不肯改造自己，那么在新的条件下，也就必然要暴露他们的反社会主义的新阴谋。
    王铁崖和楼邦彦的大胆凶恶的言论反映了钱端升小集团的阴谋，那就是推翻1952年“院系调整”后的新院系，成立“大法学院”的方案。
    我曾三次耳闻“院系再调整”的消息。一次是楼邦彦说的，他主张把人大、北大的法律系归并到政法学院。另一次是王铁崖说的，他主张把人大法律系合并到北大。第三次是王铁崖与楼邦彦一齐说的，钱端升想搞个像“伦敦经济政治学院”那样的大政法学院。大家知道，伦敦经济政治学院就是英国右派社会党人韦伯、威尔斯、拉斯基之流所创办的，在组织系统上是隶属于伦敦大学的，在思想系统上是传播资产阶级改良主义的。照钱端升的永远不会实现的方案，“大法学院”同样将隶属于北京大学。
    对他们说来，这个“方案”是“持之有故、言之有理”的。既然，“人民大学是教条主义的大蜂窝，”“中央政法干部学校是宗派主义的老母鸡”，“北大法律系是人大与中央干校的杂拌儿”，果尔，那么，殊应像钱端升、王铁崖、楼邦彦等“名流学者”之处心积虑，对它们一齐加以推翻，另起炉灶。果尔，则钱端升当副校长、院长，楼邦彦当教务长，王铁崖当总务长，乃是必然的逻辑结果。
    如果这个奇怪的方案变成了实际，将会产生什么后果呢？照王铁崖的主张：第一、要大大减少课程，“人民民主国家法”应该取消！“苏联国家法”应该列为选修课！“资产阶级国家法”应该照解放前的讲法进行教学！“中国国家法”问题太多，应该由楼邦彦来讲授！什么“土地法”、“劳动法”、“合作社法”统统不要！第二、使“国际法”离法律系、国际关系史离历史系而独立出来，取消外交学院和国际关系研究所，另外成立大“国际关系系”，成为“大法学院”的一部分，由王铁崖来主持，集全国所有的国际法学者于北大。他们认为这样就可以在十二年内赶上他们所理想的世界先进水平，即资产阶级法学水平了。
    必须指出，这个“大法学院”方案的目的不仅仅是推翻新院系，走资产阶级法学的道路。“大法学院”不过是他们干政治的工具、武器。他们真正的方案是通过“鸣”、“放”或者在成立了“大法学院”之后通过讲坛，吹倒共产党——推翻共产党在政法界与外交界的领导。这就是钱端升小集团所作的大文章。
    他们依靠一些什么“条件”呢？
    他们，正如章伯钧所说的，都是“研究政治的人”。他们“研究”了周总理“关于知识分子问题”的报告，自以为“了不起”，想到“知识分子的任务一天比一天明确”，大有可为了。去年匈牙利事件的发生加强了他们的幻想，今年党组织进行整风他们就以为有机可乘了。于是这批右派分子，利令智昏，把无产阶级的绝对优势，看成了绝对劣势，以为他们的“时机”到来了。王铁崖辱骂党在学校工作中的领导：“学术界、教育界出现了那么多头衔，那么重头衔，实在使人惊异……好像引人重视的，不是文章道德，而是职位头衔。简直是衙门。”然而重头衔的正是他们自己，他们以学者的头衔，作为阴谋反党的武器。王铁崖说过，钱端升回到北大，起码是个副校长。王铁崖骂过党，说政法学院气量小，不给费青一个正教务长。钱端升更公开说过他曾为楼邦彦争个教研室副主任的头衔。楼邦彦本人也说过，政法学院老教授分成三等：雷洁琼、严景耀、芮沐是一等，他们带有主任或副主任的头衔；楼邦彦自己是二等，参加教学，而没有主任的头衔；其他都是三等角色，被“打入冷宫”（指一时不参加教学，而在研究室自学的老教授）。必须指出，他们这样做，当然不是为了一个“教务长”，其用意远远超过了“头衔”的追求，——这批人是要通过篡夺领导，从事“二次彻底改革”。他们同声辩称：老教师受到压制，个人能力没有发挥出来。今日政法教育“一塌糊涂”，“法律科学落后”，“科学研究工作没有人管”，所有这一切在他们看来都是教条主义地学习苏联的恶果。他们一致认为：司法改革出了“偏差”，院系调整把老教师打得“七零八散”。他们放肆胡说：“官僚主义和宗派主义的根在董老”（指董必武同志）。他们对整个政法领导破口大骂：“保守、宗派”。他们狡辩法律的特殊性，说强调法律的阶级性乃是宗派主义者的借口，目的是“关门”、“包办”、
  “垄断”、“排挤旧人”。于是他们开始器重一向被他们所瞧不起的老教师，要所有的旧法人员“归队”，重新“上台”。包括解放前夕混进大学里来的“立法委员”、伪军政人员、流氓、特务，在他们眼里，都成了
  “高级知识分子”。王铁崖曾以蛮横的口吻叫嚣说：“现在高级知识分子只要主动表示要到那里，就可以到那里，这是中央的决策。”由此可见，钱端升、王铁崖、楼邦彦在周总理关于知识分子问题的报告出来之后，就在那里执行民盟中央章罗同盟争取知识分子的罪恶勾当。
    人民日报的社论说得好，反动的阶级敌人为什么自投罗网呢？“利令智昏”。利者，夺取权力的意思。以钱端升的野心而论，何止于一校之长，——多么寒伧！反动家伙，利令智昏，到处点火，以为一触即发，以为他们所深恶痛绝的无产阶级专政就要完蛋了。就是在这种思想情况下，八年来被压抑在他们心中的阶级怒火冒出来了，烧到我们身上了。在整风运动期间的大暴露，不过是抓住了他们的大批真凭实据而已。他们在这次整风运动中所进行的一系列的阴谋活动是由来已久的、日积月累的阶级怒火的冲击。
    楼邦彦和王铁崖原是钱端升的得意门生。楼邦彦一度充当胡匪宗南军营中的上校教官，王铁崖则一心追求国民党外交部司长的职位。在人民解放战争时期，楼邦彦向蒋介石献过策，说要搞宪法，（行宪）必须先戡乱。戡乱就是消灭共产党（见“观察”第三卷第一期“动员、戡乱、行宪”）。人民解放战争即将在全国范围内取得胜利的前夕，当沈阳被围时，王铁崖、楼邦彦等人还跑到东北去作“安定人心”的工作，美其名曰“讲学”，企图挽救反动派垂死的命运。
    他们确是野心勃勃的。北京解放前夕，在王铁崖家里，楼邦彦和王铁崖就密谈过“谁坐人民政协的交椅”的问题。楼邦彦道出了他们共同的野心：“这一辈子在政治舞台上有没有份儿，全看这一着了”。就是这颗卑鄙的资产阶级的政客野心，在解放以后，驱使他们用尽心机去骗取党对他们的信任，以便完成他们在解放前未完成的反共反人民的肮脏任务：从内部来打垮党对全国政权的领导。
    我很早就警告过楼邦彦，要他割断同钱端升的愚蠢而罪恶的关系，对他说：“钱端升要把你从司法局‘拉回去’，是永远不会实现的主观幻想。”现在，真相大白，事情不单是永远不会实现，而且是一件不能告人的阴谋。应该告诉这批人，我们党是强大的工人阶级的先进部队，不是什么“宗派”，我们新大学是向阳的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的学术园地，不是什么“衙门”了；我们政法院系是人民民主专政的忠诚的卫士，是社会主义理论战线上的年青的先锋，不是什么“教条主义的大蜂窝”、不是什么“宗派主义的老母鸡”，你们的阴谋已经破产了。
    现在，为首的钱端升已经开始承认自己的罪行，他在北京市第二届人民代表大会第二次会议上说他“有篡夺政法学院领导权的野心，更从而发展到具有篡夺政法部门的领导权的野心，也是客观的发展规律。”然而，关于“大法学院”方案的阴谋，他还不敢拿出真诚和勇气加以承认。对此，就要看看楼邦彦和王铁崖有没有真诚和勇气了。我认为具体问题具体交代，是唯一自救救人的办法。钱端升小集团必须粉碎，而且一定要粉碎，因为它和人民之间的矛盾已经达到了水火不相容之点。它不得不被粉碎，它被粉碎了。这也是客观的发展规律。问题只是时间和条件。
