Xinhua News Agency, August 16th: This summer vacation, many university and middle school students across the country have engaged in a meaningful activity: participating in physical labor. Among them, the largest number participated in agricultural labor.

According to statistics from 73 schools in Beijing, by the beginning of August, over 12,600 middle school students had participated in short-term physical labor. An obligatory labor force consisting of 1,500 graduating middle school students went to nearby state-owned farms in early August in two groups to assist in production, and they are currently weeding and accumulating fertilizer in the fields. Some students used the summer vacation to help schools build houses, repair experimental gardens, help factories clean machines, and sell goods and tickets in stores and cinemas. Some students also went to the railway to work as temporary train attendants or helped clean the streets late at night. More than 3,000 students from various universities in Shanghai also began to participate in physical labor in the suburban countryside from August 7th. After the start of the summer vacation in Fujian, it was the season for summer harvest and summer planting. Students who returned to the countryside joined their fathers and brothers in field work or household labor. When students of Shenyang No. 31 Middle School heard that three new children's recreation places were to be built in Tiexi District, the industrial area where they were located, the whole school contracted to build a park, which was named Red Scarf Park after completion.

Some students in Shenyang, Fuzhou and other places also participated in "work-study" paid labor. After two to three hundred students from Shenyang No. 4 Middle School participated in digging ditches and repairing canals, the labor remuneration they received in more than 20 days was enough to solve nearly half of their semester's food expenses. Many middle school students in Fuzhou participated in road construction and other labor and received certain remuneration.

The enthusiasm of students in various places to participate in physical labor is very high, and many people have been tempered in the labor, and some have even been praised. More than 80 students from Beijing Hui Nationality College went to the Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative to help, and in less than a day they removed weeds from more than 100 acres of cotton fields. Students from Beijing No. 8 Girls' Middle School, who worked as salespersons in the department store, enthusiastically served customers, achieving "never getting tired of answering hundreds of questions, never getting tired of taking hundreds of items," and were praised by customers. After more than 400 high school graduates in Shenyang participated in a period of labor in the Gaokan Agricultural Cooperative, their understanding of agricultural production has been greatly improved. As of August 7, the number of people who expressed their intention to participate in agricultural production if they failed to enter university has increased from the original 48 to more than 150. After more than 3,000 students from various universities in Shanghai underwent more than a month of anti-Rightist struggle at school, they all wanted to cultivate their class feelings for the working people in the process of eating, living, and working with the farmers this time.

    培养劳动人民的阶级感情
    各地学生参加体力劳动
    新华社16日讯  今年暑期，全国各地许多大、中学生都开展了一项有意义的活动——参加体力劳动。其中以参加农业劳动的人最多。
    北京市据七十三个学校的统计，到8月上旬为止，参加短期体力劳动的中学生已有一万二千六百多名。由一千五百名本届中学毕业生组成的义务劳动大队，8月初分两批先后到附近国营农场帮助生产，目前他们正在田间除草和积肥。有些学生利用暑期帮助学校盖房子、修实验园地，帮助工厂擦机器，到商店、电影院售货和卖票。还有些学生到铁路上去当临时性的列车员，或者在深夜帮助打扫街道。上海市各高等学校的三千多名学生，也从8月7日开始陆续到郊区农村参加体力劳动。福建学生暑期开始以后，正是夏收夏种时节，回到农村的学生就同他们的父兄一道，参加了田间劳动或家庭劳动。沈阳市三十一中学生听说他们所在的工业区——铁西区要新修三个儿童游艺场所，全校学生就承包了修一处公园，修好后命名为红领巾公园。
    沈阳、福州等地有些学生还参加了“勤工俭学”性质的有酬劳动。沈阳市第四中学两三百名学生参加了挖沟修渠的劳动后，二十多天所得的劳动报酬已能解决近半学期的伙食费。福州市有许多中学生参加了修建马路等劳动，他们都得到了一定的报酬。
    各地学生参加体力劳动的热情很高，许多人在劳动中得到了锻炼，有的还受到表扬。北京回民学院八十多名学生到曙光农业社去帮忙，不到一天就拔除了一百多亩棉田上的野草。到百货大楼当售货员的北京市女八中的学生热心为顾客服务，做到了“百问不烦、百拿不厌”，受到顾客的表扬。沈阳市四百多名高中毕业生在高坎农业社参加了一个时期的劳动以后，对农业生产的认识已有很大提高，到8月7日为止，表示考不上大学就参加农业生产的，已由原来的四十八人增加到一百五十多人。上海各高等学校的三千多名学生在学校经过一个多月的反右派斗争以后，都想在这次与农民同吃、同住、同劳动的过程中，培养自己的劳动人民的阶级感情。（附图片）
