Opening Socialist Ideological Education Courses
Peking University Actively Prepares

(Our dispatch) The Chinese Communist Party's Peking University Committee is actively preparing for the Marxist-Leninist political courses for the next semester, planning to allocate more time than the original political courses in the coming academic year to offer socialist ideological education courses. The content of the courses will be closely integrated with the current political situation.

To ensure the implementation of socialist ideological education, the university Party committee has established a Socialist Ideological Education Committee to uniformly arrange and inspect the teaching tasks of each political course teaching and research section. Each department has also established socialist ideological education groups. In addition to studying and discussing the reports made by Comrades Lu Dingyi and Kang Sheng at the Beijing Marxist-Leninist Teachers' Report Meeting, the Socialist Ideological Education Committee has also arranged for all political instructors to use the summer vacation to study relevant documents and classic works, summarize their experiences and lessons learned from the anti-rightist struggle, and further improve their ideological understanding, deeply recognizing the necessity of offering socialist ideological education courses, and mobilizing everyone to find ways to do a good job in the teaching of this course. At present, the instructors are starting to write teaching outlines, striving to complete them by early September.

    开设社会主义思想教育课程
    北京大学积极进行准备工作
    本报讯　中共北京大学委员会积极进行下学期的马列主义政治课的准备工作，计划于今后一学年内，划出比原有政治课还要多的时间，开设社会主义思想教育课程。课程的内容要和当前政治形势密切结合。
    为了保证贯彻社会主义思想教育，学校党委已建立社会主义思想教育委员会，统一布置、检查各政治课教研室教学任务。各系也都建立社会主义思想教育小组。各政治教员除了正在学习、讨论陆定一、康生同志先后在北京市马列主义教师报告会上所作的报告以外，社会主义思想教育委员会还布置他们利用暑假期间学习有关文件和经典著作，总结自己反右派斗争的体会和经验教训，把思想认识提高一步，深刻认识开设社会主义思想教育课程的必要性，发动大家想办法搞好这门课的教学工作。目前，各教员正在着手编写教学提纲，争取于9月初编好。
