Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, August 6th: The CPC Lanzhou Municipal Committee convened a mobilization meeting on the 5th for all basic construction units in the city to strive to complete and exceed this year's plan. More than 800 workers, technicians, and leading cadres from over 40 units attended the meeting. At the meeting, Sun Jianfeng, Secretary of the CPC Lanzhou Municipal Committee and Deputy Mayor of Lanzhou, delivered a report.

During the first half of the year, Lanzhou's basic construction units made improvements in construction management compared to last year, and various units achieved some success in increasing production and practicing economy. The Lanzhou Engineering General Company alone saved the state 200 tons of steel, 665 tons of cement, and 686 cubic meters of wood in the first half of the year by promoting advanced experiences such as cold-drawing of steel bars, semi-rigid concrete, and using bamboo instead of wood. Nine units, including the Lanzhou Oil Refinery, Lanzhou Construction Engineering Company, and Agan Town Coal Mine Engineering Office, saved the state more than 4.39 million yuan in the first half of the year.

However, the completion of the plans by various units was not good. By the end of July, on average, only about 35% of the annual basic construction plan had been completed. The plan completion rate for large projects such as the Lanzhou Petroleum Machinery Plant was the worst, at less than 30%.

In his report, Sun Jianfeng pointed out that the reasons for the poor plan completion were mainly the widespread existence of a slackening mentality. Problems that could be solved were not actively addressed, and there was mutual buck-passing and shirking responsibility. There was a belief that the state was going to adjust the scale and speed of construction, so leadership could be relaxed, and the completion of the state plan was not given importance. He said that Lanzhou is a key construction area of the country, and this year's tasks have not been reduced compared to last year. The investment in large projects such as the oil refinery and petroleum machinery plant has increased significantly compared to last year. And there are better conditions for completing these tasks than last year.

Sun Jianfeng said that in order to complete the tasks, first of all, the leadership must resolutely overcome the negative slackening mentality, fully utilize favorable conditions, organize a construction upsurge, and deeply develop the movement to increase production and practice economy. Secondly, various units must do a good job in cooperation and coordination, support each other, overcome departmentalism, and establish an overall perspective. He said that according to Lanzhou's climate, there are still three and a half months of construction time left. Excluding holidays and rainy days, the actual working days are less than 97 days. Therefore, to organize a construction upsurge, the leadership must personally take action, ensure the quality of the project and safe construction, in order to complete the construction tasks assigned by the state. This is also a concrete and powerful counterattack against the bourgeois right-wing elements.

    坚决保证完成今年基本建设计划
    中共兰州市委动员组织施工高潮
    新华社兰州6日电　中共兰州市委5日召开全市基本建设单位争取完成和超额完成今年计划的动员大会。参加这个大会的有四十多个单位的工人、技术人员和各级领导干部八百多人。会上，由中共兰州市委书记、兰州市副市长孙剑峰做了报告。
    兰州市各基本建设单位上半年在施工管理方面比去年有了改进，各单位的增产节约也取得了一些成绩。单是兰州工程总公司由于在上半年推广了钢筋冷拉、半硬性混凝土和以竹材代木材等先进经验，就为国家节约了钢材二百吨、水泥六百六十五吨、木材六百八十六立方公尺。兰州炼油厂、兰州市建筑工程公司和阿干镇煤矿工程处等九个单位，上半年为国家节省资金四百三十九万多元。
    但是，各单位的计划完成不好。到7月底止，平均只完成全年基本建设计划的35％左右。兰州石油机械厂等大工程计划完成的最差，还不到30％。
    孙剑峰在报告中指出，计划完成不好的原因，主要是普遍存在松劲思想，能解决的问题也未积极想办法解决，互相推托、扯皮，以为国家要调整建设规模和速度，就可以放松领导，不重视国家计划的完成。他说，兰州是国家的重点建设地区，今年的任务并未比去年减少，炼油厂、石油机械厂等大工程的投资，都比去年增加很多。而完成这些任务比去年也有更好的条件。
    孙剑峰说，为了完成任务，首先要领导上坚决克服消极松劲思想，充分发挥有利条件，组织施工高潮，深入开展增产节约运动；其次各单位要作好协作配合工作，互相支援，克服本位主义，树立全面观点。他说，今后的施工时间，按兰州气候还有三个半月，除掉假日和雨天，实际工作日不到九十七天，因此，要组织施工高潮，必须领导亲自动手，保证工程质量和安全施工，以期完成国家交给的建设任务，这也就是具体的有力的对资产阶级右派分子的反击。
