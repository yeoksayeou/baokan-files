　　Kunyang Phosphate Fertilizer Plant Goes Into Production
　　Annual Production of 200,000 Tons of Phosphate Fertilizer Can Increase Grain Production by 800 Million Jin
　　This newspaper, Yuxi, 28th. The Kunyang Phosphate Fertilizer Plant, with an annual production of 200,000 tons, has been put into operation. Production results show that the performance of the machines is good. The original design capacity was for each ball mill to produce seven to ten tons of phosphate fertilizer per hour, but within a few days of operation, the production of each ball mill has already reached twelve tons. The Kunyang Phosphate Fertilizer Plant is located on the shore of Dianchi Lake and below the Tianzemiao Phosphate Fertilizer Mountain. Open-pit mined ore can be transported down by hoists. After the phosphate fertilizer is produced, it is transported to Kunming via Dianchi Lake, and then to various parts of the country.
　　The Kunyang Phosphate Fertilizer Mountain has very rich reserves, with a proven small portion of 110 million tons. According to the estimates of the surveyors, the reserves are about 2 billion tons. The grade of phosphate fertilizer here reaches over 30%. As a result of application by many agricultural cooperatives, each jin of phosphate fertilizer can increase grain production by an average of two jin, and up to five jin in the highest cases. Based on an annual production of 200,000 tons of phosphate fertilizer, it can increase grain production by about 800 million jin each year.

　　昆阳磷肥厂投入生产
　  年产磷肥二十万吨，可增产粮食八亿斤
    本报玉溪28日电　年产二十万吨的昆阳磷肥厂已经投入生产。生产结果表明，机器的性能是良好的。原先设计能力，一台球磨每小时生产磷肥七吨到十吨，但是投入生产没几天，每台球磨的生产量就已达到十二吨。昆阳磷肥厂地处滇池边和天子庙磷肥山下。露天开采的矿石可以用卷扬机运送下来。磷肥制成后，经由滇池运至昆明，然后再运到国内各地。
    昆阳磷肥山蕴藏量非常丰富，已经探明的一小部分就有一亿一千万吨。根据勘察人员的估计，蕴藏量约有二十亿吨。这里磷肥的品位达到30％以上。很多农业社施用的结果，每斤磷肥平均可增产粮食二斤，最高的到五斤。以年产磷肥二十万吨计算，每年约可增产粮食八亿斤。
