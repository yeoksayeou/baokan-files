    The Sixth World Youth and Student Festival for Peace and Friendship, which has attracted worldwide attention, concluded victoriously today at the Lenin Central Stadium in Moscow after two weeks of intense activities.
    The scale of this festival and the number of participants are unprecedented. One hundred and twenty-seven countries sent 100,000 youth representatives to the festival, a significant increase in both participating countries and the number of participants compared to previous festivals. Many countries in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East participated in the festival for the first time. China's delegation, consisting of 1,200 people, was also unprecedentedly large.
    The festival activities were rich and varied, with 350 to 400 activities every day. All of these activities were imbued with one thought, one purpose: to further enhance friendship and mutual understanding among the youth of all countries.
    One of the great achievements of the festival is its powerful expression to the world of the lofty aspirations of the younger generation for peace and friendship. Whether it was the grand peace parade at the opening ceremony, the mutual celebrations and meetings of young people from various countries, or the mass rallies against atomic and hydrogen weapons, young people from all countries unanimously expressed: "No war! No more war!" "Don't let a third atomic bomb fall!" These inspiring and magnificent scenes expressed the peaceful wishes of hundreds of millions of young people around the world. This is a powerful demonstration of the world's forces for peace against the forces of war. The festival also fully demonstrated that countries with different social systems can coexist peacefully and that people from all countries can interact freely. The young people participating in this festival represent different social systems, different political and religious beliefs, but they can all unite closely on the basis of peace and friendship and opposition to war. They jointly laid the foundation for "Friendship Park," held various political and academic discussions to explore the truth, held various artistic and sports competitions for mutual observation and learning, and held friendship gatherings between young people from socialist countries and capitalist countries, and between young people from colonial powers and colonial countries to enhance mutual understanding. There is no doubt that the holding of this festival will play a significant role in further expanding the friendship of young people around the world, promoting the unity of young people from all countries, and strengthening the power of young people to defend peace and oppose war.
    This festival has received the support of the governments and youth organizations of many countries, especially the strong support of the Soviet government and the Soviet people, the hosts of the festival. Every participant in the festival personally felt the tremendous efforts made by the Soviet government and people in preparing and organizing this festival, and personally felt the Soviet government and people's hospitality and determination to love peace and oppose war; they will all remember the words of Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union: "Cherish peace. Unite your youthful strength to defend peace and strengthen the friendship and mutual understanding of the people of all countries, and strive for a bright future for all mankind!" However, the imperialist countries, led by the United States, were so hostile and afraid of the festival that they did everything possible to sabotage and slander it. The US State Department refused to issue visas to American youth who wanted to participate in the festival, declared the festival's organizing committee a subversive organization, and ordered US ambassadors to North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries to take measures to prevent local youth from participating in the festival. These actions by the imperialist countries, led by the United States, once again exposed their true colors of hating friendship and rejecting peace. However, the imperialists' attempts to sabotage the festival did not succeed. Many young people, including those from the United States, overcame many difficulties and participated in the festival as travelers. This shows that the imperialists cannot stop young people from embarking on the road to peace and friendship. Let the warmongers tremble in the thunderous cries of "Striving for Peace and Friendship!"
    Chinese youth representatives, like those who participated in previous festivals, actively participated in various activities of the festival. Their meetings with youth representatives from the Soviet Union and other socialist countries strengthened the great unity of the youth of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union; their meetings with youth representatives from nationalist countries, colonies, and dependencies promoted the great unity of Asian and African countries against imperialism; their meetings with youth representatives from the United States and the United Kingdom helped to promote mutual understanding and establish friendly relations. Chinese young artists and athletes achieved excellent results in performances and competitions, which powerfully demonstrated the great achievements China has made in art and sports in recent years. The Chinese youth delegation has learned many useful things and will bring back the friendship of young people from all over the world.
    The Sixth World Youth Festival concluded victoriously today. Youth representatives from all five continents will bid farewell to joyful Moscow with pleasant impressions and the determination to strive for peace and friendship, and return to their respective countries. We wish them everlasting youth and lasting friendship. We wish them to bring the flowers of "Peace and Friendship" to all corners of the world, to unite more closely with all peace-loving people, and to fight to the end for peace and friendship and against war. Peace and friendship are the common aspirations of all mankind. Let peace-loving people all over the world join the youth representatives who participated in the festival in shouting:
    Long Live Peace! Long Live Friendship!

### 和平万岁！友谊万岁！

    和平万岁！友谊万岁！
    举世瞩目的第六届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节，在经过为期两周的紧张的活动以后，今天在莫斯科列宁中央运动场胜利闭幕了。
    这次联欢节规模之大、参加人数之多是前所未有的。参加这次联欢节的有一百二十七个国家的十万名青年代表，参加的国家和人数比上几届联欢节大大增多了。亚非及中近东的许多国家都是第一次参加联欢节。我国派出的一千二百人组成的代表团，也是空前庞大的。
    这次联欢节的活动是丰富多采的，每天的活动项目达三百五十次到四百次之多。所有这些活动都贯串着一个思想，一个目的，即是进一步增进各国青年的友谊和互相了解。
    联欢节的巨大成就之一，是它向全世界有力地表达了青年一代争取和平与友谊的崇高愿望。无论是开幕式的和平大游行，无论是各国青年的相互联欢和会见以及反对原子武器和氢武器的群众大会，各国青年都一致表示出：“不要战争！不许战争！”“不要让第三颗原子弹降落！”这些激动人心的雄壮场面，表达了全世界亿万青年的和平心愿。这是全世界和平力量对战争势力的强大示威。联欢节同时也充分地表明了不同社会制度的国家可以和平共处，各国人民可以自由交往。参加这次联欢节的青年都代表着不同的社会制度，不同的政治和宗教信仰，但是，他们都能在和平与友谊和反对战争的基础上紧密地团结起来。他们共同为“友谊公园”奠基，为探明真理而举行各种政治、学术的讨论会，为互相观摩学习举行内容繁多的艺术比赛和体育比赛，为增进相互了解而举行社会主义国家与资本主义国家、宗主国与殖民地国家青年的友谊联欢。无疑，这次联欢节的举行，对于进一步扩大世界青年的友谊，促进各国青年的团结，增强青年保卫和平和反对战争的力量，将会起十分巨大的作用。
    这次联欢节得到了许多国家的政府和青年团体的支持，特别是得到这次联欢节主人苏联政府和苏联人民的大力支持。联欢节的每一个参加者，都亲身感到苏联政府和人民筹备和组织这次联欢节所作出的巨大努力，亲身感到苏联政府和人民的殷勤好客和酷爱和平、反对战争的决心；他们都会牢记着苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫所讲的话：“要珍爱和平。为了保卫和平和加强各国人民的友谊和相互了解，把你们青年的力量团结起来，为全人类美好的未来而奋斗！”但是，以美国为首的帝国主义国家却那样仇视和害怕联欢节，他们百般地破坏和污蔑联欢节。美国国务院不给愿意参加联欢节的美国青年发签证，宣布联欢节筹备委员会为颠覆组织，并下令美国驻北大西洋集团各国大使采取措施阻挠当地青年参加联欢节。以美国为首的帝国主义国家的这些行为，再一次暴露了它们仇视友谊、不要和平的真面目。但是，帝国主义者企图破坏联欢节的这些阴谋并没有实现。包括美国在内的不少青年，他们冲破重重难关，以旅行者的身份参加了联欢节。这说明了帝国主义者是阻碍不住青年们走上争取和平与友谊之路的。让战争贩子们在雷动的“争取和平与友谊”的呼声中发抖吧！
    中国青年代表们和参加过去历届联欢节一样，积极参加了联欢节的各种活动。他们同苏联和其他社会主义国家的青年代表的会见，增强了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营青年大团结；同民族主义国家、殖民地和附属国青年代表的会见，促进了亚非国家青年的反帝国主义的大团结；同美国和英国青年代表的会见，有助于彼此互相了解和建立友谊关系。中国青年艺术家和体育家在表演和比赛中获得了优异的成绩，有力地说明几年来中国的艺术和体育运动获得了巨大成就。中国青年代表团学到了许多有益的东西，并将带回全世界青年的友谊。
    第六届青年联欢节今天胜利闭幕了。来自五大洲的各国青年代表将带着愉快的印象、争取和平与友谊的决心告别欢乐的莫斯科，回到自己的祖国去。我们祝他们青春常在，友谊永存。我们祝他们把“和平与友谊”的花朵带到世界各个角落，同一切爱好和平的人士更紧密地团结起来，为争取和平与友谊、为反对战争而奋斗到底。和平与友谊，这是全人类的共同愿望。让全世界爱好和平的人民同参加联欢节的青年代表们一道高呼：
    和平万岁！友谊万岁！
