Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 21st – Statistics from Anhui Province's judicial organs show that recently, many criminals have taken advantage of the rampant attacks by bourgeois rightists to attempt to overturn their verdicts. Anhui judicial organs have seriously dealt with this activity by criminals.

According to statistics, the number of appeals received by People's Courts at all levels in Anhui Province has increased abnormally in the past two to three months. Many of these appeals attempt to deny part or all of the facts, in order to achieve the goal of overturning the original verdict. When dealing with these unreasonable appeals, judicial departments in various parts of Anhui Province immediately pointed out their errors, conducted criticism and education, and resolutely rejected them. Those who made trouble without reason and violated criminal law were given the punishments they deserved. For example, Liang Fajin, a murderer in Feidong County, had both witnesses and physical evidence against him, but recently he also wanted to overturn the verdict, denying the murder and presenting "witnesses". After investigation, the "witnesses" he presented turned out to be fabricated false names, and the judicial department resolutely rejected his appeal. During the period of "Great Blooming and Contending," rightists in the industrial and commercial circles of Hefei openly incited illegal capitalists to overturn their verdicts. Zhou Zongyou, an illegal capitalist who had been sentenced for forcing a worker to death during the "Five-Anti Campaign," recently filed an appeal with the support of rightists, requesting early release and job placement. After reviewing the case, the Municipal People's Court sternly rejected his unreasonable appeal.

Shen Yinggao, the principal culprit of a small theft gang, was released on parole after being sentenced to four years in prison due to illness. However, he recently went around to the Anhui Provincial political and legal departments to appeal, distorting the facts, making trouble without reason, and threatening suicide in an attempt to overturn the verdict. Based on the above situation, the judicial department rejected his unreasonable appeal and immediately returned him to prison to continue serving his unexpired sentence. Zhao Jiafu, a ruffian and swindler from Anqing City, posed as a revolutionary disabled soldier and swindled people everywhere. After being sentenced and released several times, he still did not repent. Recently, he went to Beijing to the Supreme People's Court and other political and legal departments to file unreasonable appeals, and defrauded people of money. The judicial organs of Anhui Province have decided to give him legal sanctions again.

　　判决严正　不容翻案
　　皖司法机关严肃处理企图翻案的犯罪分子
    新华社合肥21日电　安徽省司法机关的一些统计数字说明，近来有不少犯罪分子乘资产阶级右派分子猖狂进攻的机会，企图翻案。安徽司法机关对犯罪分子的这一活动进行了严肃的处理。
    据统计，最近两三个月来，安徽省各级人民法院受理申诉案件反常地增加。其中有不少申诉案件是企图否认一部分或者全部事实，以期达到翻案的目的。安徽省各地司法部门在处理这些无理的申诉的时候，当即指出其错误，进行批评教育，并坚决予以驳回；对无理取闹而触犯刑律的，就给予应得的处分。例如肥东县杀人犯梁发金，人证、物证俱在，最近也要翻案，否认杀人，并提出了“人证”。经过调查，他提出的“人证”是捏造的假姓名，司法部门就坚决驳回了他的申诉。在大鸣大放期间，合肥市工商界的右派分子曾公开鼓动不法资本家翻案。在“五反”中曾因逼死工人而判刑的不法资本家周宗友，最近也在右派分子的支持下提出申诉，要求提前释放，安排工作，市人民法院复查了案情以后，严正地驳斥了他的无理申诉。
    一个偷窃小集团的主犯沈应高，在被判处四年徒刑后因病假释。但是他最近四处找安徽省政法部门申诉，歪曲事实，无理取闹，并且以自杀相要挟，企图翻案。司法部门根据上述情况，驳回了他的无理申诉，并立即收监继续执行他未满的刑期。安庆市一个兵痞、骗子赵家福，冒充革命残废军人，到处招摇撞骗，几次判刑释放后，仍不悔改。最近他又跑到北京找最高人民法院及其他政法部门提出无理申诉，并拐骗钱财，安徽省司法机关决定再给他以法律制裁。
