    Frequently Prevent and Control Swine Diseases
    By Our Correspondent
    Since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued the decision on developing pig production in February of this year, farmers' income from pig raising has increased, their enthusiasm has risen, and pig raising has developed significantly in many regions. However, farmers still have a common concern, which is the fear of swine diseases that they cannot control, leading to the death of pigs and loss of their capital. This concern hinders the further development of pig raising. To prevent swine diseases, our country has made great efforts in the past few years, gradually reducing the number of pig deaths. However, this problem is far from being solved, and pig infectious diseases are still prevalent in many regions. In 1956 alone, about 5 million pigs died nationwide. In the first half of this year, according to incomplete statistics from eleven provinces and cities including Henan, Hebei, Hunan, Hubei, and Guangdong, more than 1.32 million pigs died. This represents a significant economic loss for both the country and the farmers. It not only affects people's food consumption but also affects the development of fertilizer accumulation and grain and cotton production. Although the epidemic situation has eased, the summer season is a period of rapid reproduction of mosquitoes, flies, and other blood-sucking insects, and various swine diseases are prone to occur and spread. If prevention and control are not taken seriously, large-scale spread is still possible. Therefore, the prevention and control of swine diseases remains an urgent task.
    According to local experience, the root cause of swine diseases is poor feeding management, which weakens the pigs' resistance to disease. Therefore, to fundamentally eliminate swine diseases, it is necessary to mobilize and organize the vast number of agricultural cooperative members to adopt various active measures to improve pig feeding management. In addition to paying attention to feeding work to make pigs grow strong, special attention should be paid to pigpens. In many places, there are no pigpens at all, and pigs are allowed to run around, which makes them particularly susceptible to infection and spread of diseases. In some places, every household has a pigpen, and the situation is much better. Therefore, leaders in various regions should use examples to persuade and educate farmers, urging those who do not have pigpens to quickly find ways to build them and never allow pigs to run around. After having pigpens, special attention should be paid to the hygiene of the pens, regularly adding bedding and removing waste, and not allowing the pens to be full of half a foot of thin manure and mud. Special attention should be paid to this in the summer and autumn seasons. Only when feeding management is fundamentally improved can swine diseases be prevented more effectively.
    Universal preventive inoculation is the most effective way to prevent swine diseases. Currently, there are no chemical drugs that can effectively treat swine diseases. Although swine fever serum can be used for treatment, it is only effective in the early stages and is economically very uneconomical. Therefore, the best way is to carry out preventive inoculation early. In areas where swine infectious diseases are prevalent and in areas where diseases have occurred in the past one or two years, efforts should be made to inoculate all possible pigs. In general areas, preventive inoculation should also be carried out according to the epidemic prevention force. Some provinces have not solved the epidemic prevention funding problem and should find ways to solve it quickly. In 1956, Heilongjiang Province universally carried out swine fever preventive inoculation, with the number of inoculated pigs accounting for more than six-tenths of the total number of pigs at that time, and most counties reaching more than eight-tenths. As a result, the number of pigs that died due to swine infectious diseases was reduced by six-tenths compared with 1955.
    One of the important reasons why swine diseases are spreading so widely is that pig farmers often buy piglets from other places, bringing swine diseases into their local areas. Therefore, all localities must make efforts in two aspects: on the one hand, it is necessary to actively organize agricultural cooperatives to raise sows and an appropriate number of boars in a planned way, breed piglets locally, supply them to members for feeding, and gradually reduce the number of piglets purchased from other places, finally achieving complete self-sufficiency. On the other hand, when it is necessary to buy pigs from other places, experienced people should be sent to select them, and quarantine work should be done thoroughly. After buying them back, they should also undergo a period of isolation, and only when it is proven that they are indeed free of disease can they be fed together. When the state transports live pigs and piglets, it must also strictly pay attention to implementing quarantine. In areas where quarantine has not yet been implemented, it should be started quickly. All sick pigs must be resolutely prohibited from being transferred and traded, and no negligence is allowed.
    Another reason for the spread of swine diseases is the consumption of pork from diseased pigs. People who eat pork from diseased pigs spread the swine diseases through feces. Moreover, if the processing is not done properly, it can easily cause poisoning. According to incomplete statistics from Hebei Province in 1956, more than 7,000 people were poisoned by eating pork from dead pigs. In order to prevent this phenomenon, on the one hand, the general public should be educated not to buy or eat pork from diseased pigs; on the other hand, quarantine work should be strengthened, and the sale of pork from diseased pigs that has not been disinfected should be strictly prohibited. Only by taking both approaches can the full effect be achieved. At the same time, quarantine work in slaughterhouses and warehouses should also be strengthened. The feces of sick livestock must be fermented before they can be supplied to farmers.
    Minsheng Agricultural Cooperative in Wulian County, Shandong Province, has not experienced swine diseases for four years because it has implemented the following measures: self-breeding and self-raising; isolating and observing newly purchased pigs, and feeding them together after they are disease-free; raising pigs in pens and not allowing pigs to run around, cleaning and disinfecting pigpens three times a month; and not buying or eating pork from diseased or dead pigs, and mobilizing all members to abide by and supervise each other. This cooperative's experience can be widely applied in various regions.
    Carrying out swine disease prevention work also requires all localities to train epidemic prevention teams in a planned way. Taking the county as a unit, during the slack farming season, adopt the method of "learning as you do and gradually improving" to train a large number of epidemic prevention workers. The existing epidemic prevention workers in agricultural cooperatives should also be transferred and trained once, or they should be organized to exchange experience in preventing and controlling swine diseases to further improve their technical level, so that epidemic prevention work can take root in the cooperative. In agricultural cooperatives that already have epidemic prevention workers, cadres should always pay attention to helping epidemic prevention workers solve the difficulties in epidemic prevention work. The labor remuneration of epidemic prevention workers should be reasonably assessed and solved by the cooperative in a unified manner.
    Swine infectious diseases are very complex and difficult to judge. If the judgment is wrong, it will not be possible to take correct epidemic prevention measures. It is difficult to ensure the correct judgment of the epidemic situation only by relying on some epidemic prevention workers. Therefore, all localities should organize veterinary diagnosis rooms and animal husbandry and veterinary work stations to help epidemic prevention workers promptly and correctly judge the epidemic diseases and put forward effective epidemic prevention measures. Folk veterinarians are a great force in epidemic prevention and should also be mobilized and organized to actively participate in epidemic prevention activities and given reasonable labor remuneration.
    The prevention and control of swine diseases is a mass work and a scientific and technological work. To do this work well, it is necessary to combine leadership and the masses, administration and technology, conscientiously study the laws of local epidemic outbreaks, formulate epidemic prevention plans, raise the necessary epidemic prevention funds, and do a good job in the supply of biological drugs. At the same time, assist agricultural cooperatives in a planned and focused manner to formulate epidemic prevention systems, impart technology, organize observations, exchange experiences, and form the prevention and control of swine diseases into a regular mass activity.
    Due to the rapid development of pig raising, the importance of preventing and controlling swine diseases is now more obvious than ever before. Farmers are now very enthusiastic about raising pigs, which is a good phenomenon. However, if the leadership does not pay attention, a major swine epidemic can cause huge disasters and reduce the enthusiasm of hundreds of millions of farmers. The leadership organs in some regions only pay attention to the development of pig raising and do not care about the prevention and control of epidemic diseases, which is a very dangerous deviation and should be corrected quickly.

    经常地防治猪疫
    本报评论员
    中共中央和国务院今年2月发出了关于发展养猪生产的决定以后，农民养猪的收益增加了，兴趣提高了，很多地区的养猪事业都有了显著的发展。但是农民还有一个普遍的顾虑，就是害怕猪疫来了没办法，死了猪赔了老本。这种顾虑妨碍着养猪事业的进一步发展。为了预防猪疫，几年以来我们国家曾经作了很大的努力，使生猪死亡数量逐渐减少。但是这个问题还远没有解决，猪的传染病至今仍在很多地区流行。1956年一年，全国死猪约五百多万头。今年上半年据河南、河北、湖南、湖北、广东等十一个省、市的不完全统计，死猪达一百三十二万多头。无论对于国家和对于农民，这都是重大的经济损失。不但影响着人民的吃用，而且影响着积肥和粮棉生产的发展。现在，疫情虽然已经缓和，但因夏季是蚊蝇和其他吸血昆虫迅速繁殖的季节，各种猪疫很容易发生和滋长，如不注意防治，仍然可能大规模地蔓延起来。因此，防治猪疫至今仍是一项迫切的事情。
      根据各地经验，猪疫发生的根本原因，是饲养管理不善，致使猪的抗病力不强。因此，为了从根本上消灭猪的疫病，必须动员和组织广大农业社员，采用各种积极的办法来改善猪的饲养管理。除了喂养工作要注意做好，使猪长得强壮以外，目下特别应当注意的是猪圈问题。有许多地方，养猪根本无圈，任猪到处乱跑，这就特别容易感染和传播疫病。有的地方家家有猪圈，情况就好得多。所以各地领导上就应该用实例向农民进行说服教育，让那些没有圈的养猪户赶快设法修圈，决不要任猪乱跑。有了圈以后，还要特别注意圈的卫生，经常垫圈出圈，不要让圈里尽是半尺深的稀粪稀泥。夏秋季节，更应当特别注意。只有饲养管理工作从根本上改善了，才能更有效地防止猪的疫病。
    普遍进行预防注射，是预防猪疫最有效的办法。目前尚无化学药品可以非常有效地治疗猪疫。猪疫血清虽然可以治疗，但也只是早期治疗才能收效，而且在经济上很不合算。因此，目前最好的办法就是早期进行预防注射。在猪传染病流行的地区和近一、二年内发病的地区，都应该争取把可能注射的猪全部注射。一般地区，也应该根据防疫力量进行预防注射。有些省防疫经费没有解决，应当赶快设法解决。黑龙江省1956年普遍进行了猪瘟预防注射，注射猪只占到当时猪只总数的十分之六以上，大部分县达到十分之八以上。这样，因猪传染病而死亡的猪数目就比1955年减少了十分之六。
    猪疫得以普遍蔓延的重要原因之一，是养猪农民经常从外地购买仔猪，把猪疫带进本地。因此，各地必须作两方面的努力：一方面，要积极组织农业社有计划地留养母猪和适当数量的公猪，就地繁殖仔猪，供给社员饲养，逐步减少向外地购买仔猪的数量，最后做到完全自给。另一方面，在不得已到外地买猪时，要派有经验的人去选择，同时要切实做好检疫工作；买回来以后，还要经过一个隔离的阶段，最后证明确实无病时再合群饲养。国家调运生猪仔猪的时候，也必须严格注意实行检疫。在尚未实行检疫的地区，应当赶快开始实行。一切有病的猪，都必须坚决禁止调运和贩运，丝毫不能疏忽大意。
    猪疫蔓延的另一个原因，是买吃病猪肉。人们吃了病猪肉，就经过粪便传播了猪疫。不仅如此，如果加工处理不好，还容易引起中毒。据河北省1956年不完全统计，因吃病死猪肉中毒的就有七千多人。为了防止这种现象，一方面要教育一般群众不买吃病猪肉；另一方面还应该加强检疫工作，严格制止出卖未经消毒处理的病猪肉。两头并进，才能收到全效。与此同时，屠宰场和仓库的检疫工作也要加强。病畜的粪便，须经发酵以后才可以供应农民。
    山东省五莲县民生农业社由于实行了自繁自养；买进新猪隔离观察，无病后合群喂养；养猪有圈，不许猪乱跑，每月清扫和消毒猪圈三次；不买吃病死猪肉等办法，并且发动全体社员共同遵守，互相监督，因此四年来一直没有发生过猪疫。这个社的经验，各地可以广泛应用。
    开展猪疫预防工作，还要求各地有计划地训练防疫队伍。要以县为单位，利用农闲季节，采取“做啥学啥，逐步提高”的办法，大量培训防疫员。对农业社已有的防疫员，也应该抽调训练一次，或者组织他们交流防治猪疫的经验，继续提高他们的技术水平，使防疫工作在社内扎根。在已经有了防疫员的农业社，干部应该经常注意帮助防疫员解决防疫工作中的困难。防疫员的劳动报酬，应当由社内合理评定，统筹解决。
    猪传染病很复杂，不容易判断。判断错了，就不可能采取正确的防疫措施。仅凭一些防疫员，是很难保证正确判断疫情的。因此，各地应当组织兽医诊断室和畜牧兽医工作站来帮助防疫员及时地正确地判断疫病，提出有效的防疫措施。民间兽医是一支很大的防疫力量，也应当动员和组织他们积极参加防疫活动，并且给以合理的劳动报酬。
    防治猪疫是一项群众性的工作，又是科学技术工作。要作好这一工作，必须领导和群众、行政和技术相结合，切实研究当地疫情发生的规律，制定防疫规划，筹措必要的防疫经费，做好生物药品的供应工作。同时要有计划有重点地协助农业社制定防疫制度，传授技术，组织观摩，交流经验，把防治猪疫形成一个经常的群众性的活动。
    由于养猪事业的迅速发展，防治猪疫的重要性现在比过去任何时候都更加明显了。农民们现在养猪热情很高，这是好现象。但是，如果领导上不加注意，一次大的猪疫就可以造成巨大的灾害，降低亿万农民的热情。有些地区领导机关对于养猪事业只管发展、不管防治疫病，这是很危险的一种偏向，应当赶快纠正。
