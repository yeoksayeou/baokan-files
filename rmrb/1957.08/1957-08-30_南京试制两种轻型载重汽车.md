Xinhua Daily News reported: The Nanjing Automobile Assembly Plant has recently undertaken the task of manufacturing two types of light trucks.

One of these vehicles is a 1.5-ton truck, available in two models. This truck is independently designed by China, drawing on the advanced performance of 46 similar light trucks from eight countries, including the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Japan, and West Germany, while also considering the specific transportation conditions in China's urban and rural areas. It is characterized by being lightweight, fast, and economical, making it suitable for short-distance transportation between suburbs and medium-distance transportation between towns, particularly for departments such as agriculture, commerce, and postal services. Based on this truck, various modified vehicles for different purposes can also be developed, such as fire trucks, ambulances, fuel tankers, water sprinkler trucks, light tipper trucks, and light buses. The other vehicle is a 2.5-ton truck, also available in two models, which will be manufactured in accordance with the Soviet GAZ-51 model.

The manufacturing of these two types of light trucks, especially the independent design of the 1.5-ton truck, is a pioneering endeavor in China. The factory will utilize existing equipment and collaborate with fraternal factories to trial-produce these two types of vehicles and put them into production next year, with minimal state investment. Currently, the engine for the 1.5-ton truck has been successfully trial-produced. Engineers from the Automobile and Tractor Research Institute of the First Ministry of Machine Building, who are in charge of this design work, arrived at the factory last month. The design work has progressed to the stage of drawing component diagrams, and sample trial production will begin at the end of this year.

　　南京试制两种轻型载重汽车
    本报讯　据新华日报消息：南京汽车制配厂最近接受了制造两种轻型载重汽车的任务。
    这两种汽车，一种是一吨半的载重汽车，有两种型号。这种汽车是参照苏、捷、美、英、法、意、日、西德等八个国家四十六种同级轻型汽车的先进性能，结合我国城乡交通的具体条件，由我国自行设计的。它具有轻便、快速、经济等特点，适合于市郊之间的短途运输和城镇之间的中途运输，特别对农业、商业、邮电等部门最为适用。以这种汽车为基础，还可以发展多种不同用途的变型汽车，如消防车、救护车、运油车、洒水车、轻便倾斜车、轻型公共汽车等。另一种汽车是两吨半的载重汽车，也有两种型号，将仿照苏联格斯51型汽车进行制造。
    制造这两种轻型汽车，特别是自己设计一吨半重载汽车，在我国还是创举。这个厂将在国家基本上不投资的情况下，利用现有设备，同兄弟工厂协作，在明年把这两种汽车试制出来并投入生产。现在，一吨半载重汽车的发动机已经试制成功。主持这项设计工作的第一机械工业部汽车工业管理局汽车拖拉机研究所的工程师们，在上月来到这个工厂。设计工作已经进行到绘制零件图的阶段，今年年底即可开始样品试制。
