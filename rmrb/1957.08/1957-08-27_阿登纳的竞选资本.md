Adenauer's Campaign Capital
　　Xi Linsheng

The West German election campaign is now entering a decisive stage. Various political parties have put forward campaign programs and are actively publicizing them. Some time ago, Adenauer threatened that his party was determined to launch a "fierce" and "ruthless" election struggle against its most dangerous opponent, the Social Democratic Party, and would spare no effort to "mobilize all forces to win the general election."

Adenauer and his Christian Democratic Union have two strong backers and several main tricks in this struggle.

　　American Support

The first strong backer that Adenauer relies on is American support.

It now appears that Adenauer's Germany is more "loyal" to American policy than other NATO allies of the United States. The so-called "American-German axis" is replacing the "American-British alliance" and playing an increasingly important role in European affairs.

Therefore, it is very important for the United States to ensure Adenauer's victory in the election. The United States has assured Adenauer that it will "do everything possible" for this. Dulles even "urged" the foreign ministers of NATO member states to "support Adenauer's re-election as Chancellor by all possible means." Recently, the United States, together with Britain and France, jointly issued a "Four-Power Declaration" with the West German government. The purpose of all this is to strengthen Adenauer's campaign position.

　　Support of Monopoly Capital

Another strong backer is of course the donations of West German monopoly capital.

Campaigns require multifaceted activities, which cannot be done without large sums of money. Here, Adenauer relied on the patronage of big capitalists.

The Adenauer government has been working hard for monopoly capital. For example, at the beginning of this year, Adenauer and his ministers traveled abroad to make arrangements for the further expansion of monopoly capital. Also, not long ago, Adenauer took a trip to the United States and Austria and tried to recover some of the assets of the old Germany.

Adenauer's active service naturally won the favor of big capitalists. In order to enable him to continue in power, they gave Adenauer's party twice as much campaign funding this year as in the 1953 election, totaling more than 100 million marks. Strong financial resources will greatly help Adenauer's party candidates win in the general election.

It is not enough to have strong backers, you also have to have some tricks. In this regard, Adenauer has several magic weapons.

　　Hypocritical Propaganda

The first magic weapon is the deceptive tactics that Adenauer is accustomed to using.

Recently, the Adenauer group has hidden their murderous faces and loudly proclaimed the high ideals of peace and justice.

In a parliamentary debate, the Christian Democratic Union and its partner parties, in the name of "for world peace," put forward a motion calling for major powers to temporarily halt nuclear weapons testing.

Shortly thereafter, the Christian Democratic Union congress adopted a campaign declaration listing universal disarmament, including nuclear weapons, as one of its main goals.

The communiqué issued by Adenauer and Eisenhower at the end of May also talked about disarmament and advocated holding a four-power foreign ministers' conference to negotiate the issue of German unification after reaching a "preliminary disarmament agreement."

Recently, Adenauer announced that his government "fully supports" the disarmament talks in London.

The tune is very pleasant, but what is the reality?

The plan to rearm West Germany and equip the West German army with nuclear weapons will never be abandoned.

Unifying Germany must be done through the "free elections" advocated by Adenauer, which is to incorporate the German Democratic Republic into the Federal Republic of Germany.

Disarmament is "approved," but the prerequisite is to unify Germany according to Adenauer's method.

Therefore, the Christian Democratic Union lists disarmament and German unification as its primary goals in its campaign manifesto, which is nothing more than a deceptive trick to deal with the general election; because it is actually trying to obstruct disarmament and block the road to German reunification.

　　Alarmist Talk

The second magic weapon is alarmist talk.

Adenauer sees that this year's general election is very different from four years ago, and the strength of the Social Democratic Party has greatly increased. This really worries him extremely. He is trying his best to undermine the influence of the Social Democratic Party among voters. To achieve this goal, he came up with the idea of ​​attacking the Social Democratic Party with as many sensational words as possible. For example, Adenauer said in a campaign speech that if the Social Democratic Party came to power after the election, the disarmament talks would be "finished." He also yelled: "The victory of the Social Democratic Party in the election means the destruction of Germany."

But it is not difficult to see who wants to make the disarmament talks "finished" and whose policies actually have the danger of leading to disaster. As the Social Democratic Party's spokesperson said: "If we talk about the danger of Germany's demise, then it should be pointed out that it is not the German Social Democratic Party, but the Christian Democratic Union, that hopes Germany will have atomic armaments." And Adenauer's "unification of Germany" policy is being used as an important obstacle to obstruct the agreement on disarmament.

　　Measures to Buy People's Hearts

In order to alleviate the people's dissatisfaction with the North Atlantic Treaty and militarist policies, Adenauer also used the so-called prosperous economy and social welfare to win people's hearts. On the one hand, he vigorously promoted "people's capitalism," and on the other hand, he relied on the position of his ruling party to give the working people some small favors that were not common on weekdays, such as increasing social insurance funds and pensions. Partial and temporary small economic benefits can indeed blind the awareness of some people. But these small favors cannot cover up the basic contradictions after all. Recently, the class contradictions in West Germany have developed significantly, and the working people have increasingly strongly expressed that they cannot tolerate the cruel exploitation of monopoly capital and the ever-increasing burden of armaments. This is what makes Adenauer most uneasy.

　　Fascist Methods

Therefore, the Adenauer party feels that it is still necessary to resort to fascist methods to safeguard its campaign position.

In 1953, in order to win the victory in the general election, Adenauer cracked down on domestic progressive forces. He arrested several thousand communists and patriots and disrupted the election rallies of the German Communist Party, etc. Now, fascist methods are also used to deal with the Social Democratic Party.

A few days ago, the stormtroopers of the Christian Democratic Union and the youth league of the Waffen-SS openly sabotaged the election propaganda of the Social Democratic Party everywhere. They stole or destroyed the Social Democratic Party's posters and prevented the party from showing movies. At the same time, they also gathered many thugs to disrupt the Social Democratic Party's campaign rallies.

These despicable acts of the Adenauer party have been criticized by the West German Social Democratic Party and other people from all walks of life. The West German rulers have made many boasts about Adenauer's "achievements," but the fact that they have to resort to such deception and fascist methods shows that Adenauer is unpopular.

### 阿登纳的竞选资本

　　阿登纳的竞选资本
　　席林生
    目前西德的竞选运动正进入一个决定性的阶段。各个政党都提出了竞选纲领在大事宣传。前些时候，阿登纳扬言他的党下定决心要向它最危险的对手社会民主党展开“剧烈的”、“无情的”竞选斗争，并且不惜“动员一切力量赢得大选的胜利”。
    阿登纳和他的基督教民主联盟在这个斗争中有两座靠山和几件主要的法宝。
            美国的撑腰
    阿登纳所依靠的第一座靠山就是美国的支持。
    现在看来，阿登纳德国对美国政策要比美国的其他北大西洋盟国更为“忠诚”。所谓“美德轴心”正在代替“美英联盟”而在欧洲事务中起着越来越大的作用。
    因此，对于美国来说，保持阿登纳在大选中得胜是非常重要的。美国已经向阿登纳保证要为此“尽一切力量”。杜勒斯还曾“力促”北大西洋集团各成员国外交部长“用一切可能的办法来支持。”阿登纳重新当选总理。最近美国又携同英法一起和西德政府共同发表了一个“四国宣言”。这一切的用意都在加强阿登纳的竞选地位。
            垄断资本的靠山
    另外一座靠山当然就是西德垄断资本的捐输。
    竞选要进行多方面的活动，没有大笔经费是不行的。这里，阿登纳就靠了大资本家的布施。
    阿登纳政府为垄断资本效劳是够卖力的。例如今年年初阿登纳和他的部长曾风尘仆仆，到国外奔走，为垄断资本进一步扩张作安排。又如不久前阿登纳到美国和奥地利跑了一趟，又把过去旧德国的一部分资产设法收了回来。
    阿登纳的积极效劳，自然博得大资本家的欢心。为了使他能继续执政，他们今年给了阿登纳党比1953年大选时多二倍的竞选经费，共一亿多马克。雄厚的财力将能大大有助于使阿登纳党的候选人在大选中获胜。
    光有靠山还不够，还得有一些手法。在这方面，阿登纳有几件法宝。
              虚伪的宣传
    第一个法宝就是阿登纳所惯用的欺骗手法。
    最近一个时期以来，阿登纳集团藏起了他们那种杀气腾腾的脸孔，而大唱和平正义的高调。
    在一次议会辩论时，基督教民主联盟和它的伙伴党派在“为了世界和平”的名义下，提出了一项要求大国有限期地停止原子武器试验的动议。
    接着不久，基督教民主联盟代表大会通过了一项竞选宣言，把包括原子武器在内的普遍裁军列为它的主要目标之一。
    5月底阿登纳和艾森豪威尔发表的会谈公报又侈谈了裁军问题，并且主张在达成
  “初步裁军协议”之后举行谈判德国统一问题的四外长会议。
    最近，阿登纳又宣布他的政府“全力支持”伦敦的裁军谈判。
    调子是很动听的，但是实际上怎么样呢？
    重新武装西德和用原子武器装备西德军队的计划是绝不放弃的。
    统一德国必须通过阿登纳所主张的“自由选举”，就是把德意志民主共和国并入德意志联邦共和国。
  裁军是“赞成的”，但先决条件是按阿登纳的办法统一德国。
    因此，基督教民主联盟在它的竞选宣言中把裁军和德国统一列为首要目标，这不过是应付大选的鬼把戏；因为它实际恰恰是竭力阻挠裁军，堵塞德国恢复统一的道路。
                危言耸听
    其次一个法宝是危言耸听。
    阿登纳眼看今年大选和四年前大不相同，社会民主党势力大增。这确实使他极为担心。他竭力要破坏社会民主党在选民中的影响。为了达到这个目的，他想出尽量耸人听闻的话来对社会民主党进行攻击。例如，阿登纳在竞选演说中说：如果大选后社会民主党执政的话，裁军谈判就将“完蛋了”。他还嚷嚷：“社会民主党在选举中胜利意味着德国的毁灭。”
    但是要看出，究竟是谁想使裁军谈判“完蛋”，谁的政策实际上有导致灾难的危险，是并不困难的。正像社会民主党的发言人所说的：“如果谈到德国灭亡的危险，那么应该指出，希望德国有原子军备的不是德国社会民主党，而是基督教民主联盟”。而阿登纳的“统一德国”政策，正在被利用作为阻挠裁军达成协议的重要障碍。
            收买人心的措施
    为了缓和人民对于北大西洋公约和军国主义政策的不满，阿登纳还用所谓繁荣的经济和社会福利来笼络人心，他一方面大事宣传“人民资本主义”，一方面又凭借他的执政党的地位对劳动人民施一些平日不大有的小恩小惠，如增加社会保险经费、养老金等等。局部和暂时的细小经济利益的确能够蒙蔽一部分人的觉悟。但是这些小恩小惠毕竟盖不住基本的矛盾。近来，西德的阶级矛盾有了明显的发展，劳动人民日益强烈地表现不能忍受垄断资本的残酷剥削和不断加重的军备负担。这是最使阿登纳感到不安的事情。
              法西斯手段
    因此，阿登纳党感到还有必要求助于法西斯的手段，来保障它的竞选地位。
    1953年阿登纳为了赢得大选的胜利，曾经对国内的进步力量加以打击。他逮捕了好几千共产党员和爱国人士并破坏德国共产党的竞选集会等等。现在，法西斯的办法也用来对付社会民主党。
    前几天基督教民主联盟的突击队和党卫军青年联盟到处对社会民主党的竞选宣传进行公开破坏。他们偷出或毁掉社会民主党的招贴牌，阻止该党放映电影。同时他们还聚集了许多打手捣乱社会民主党的竞选集会。
    阿登纳党的这些卑鄙勾当受到了西德社会民主党和其他各界人士的指责。西德统治者为阿登纳的“政绩”进行了许多吹嘘，但是他们不得不求助于这种种欺骗和法西斯的办法的事实就说明，阿登纳是不得民心的。
