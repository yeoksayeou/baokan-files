Refuting the "Two Types of Intellectuals" Theory
Cao Shujing

During the recent great blooming and contending at Beijing Normal University, many demons and monsters were released. Under the guise of helping the Party rectify its work style, they spread rumors and misled the public. Among them, the rightist Hu Ming fabricated a theory, claiming that there are two types of intellectuals: one is the type that misleads the Party and the country, only praising and not criticizing, yet they are trusted, encouraged, and promoted by the Party organization; the other is the type that works for the Party and the country. The Party finds it difficult to approach the latter, often rejecting or even attacking them.

In another speech, he also said: The Chinese nation has had two types of intellectuals since ancient times. During the Five Dynasties period, there was Feng Dao, known as the Old Man of Chang Le, who served as a subject of thirteen emperors, experienced four dynasties, and remained prosperous and wealthy throughout. This is a typical example of a shameless intellectual. On the other hand, there were figures like Wen Tianxiang and Shi Kefa, who were representatives of righteous intellectuals. The former are intellectuals who mislead the Party and the country. They are accustomed to praise and are very obedient; they are a kind of evil intellectuals. The latter are intellectuals who work for the Party and the country. They dare to criticize and expose shortcomings, and are righteous people. But they are labeled with the crime of "attacking the leadership" and relegated to the cold palace.

Hu Ming's statement distorts the facts, cites inappropriate examples, and is, of course, completely wrong. However, because he used seemingly clear-cut terms like "misleading the Party and the country" and "working for the Party and the country," "evil" and "righteous," and used historical figures with vastly different moral characters as metaphors, it is very easy to mislead people. The errors and maliciousness of these words are often not immediately apparent, so it is necessary to analyze and criticize them.

First of all, Hu Ming opposes praise and criticism, believing that anyone who praises the Party and the socialist construction cause is an "evil" intellectual who "misleads the Party and the country." On the other hand, anyone who dares to criticize and expose the Party's shortcomings is a "righteous" intellectual who "works for the Party and the country." That is to say, intellectuals can only say bad things about the Party and are not allowed to say good things; they are only allowed to expose the Party's shortcomings and are not allowed to praise its achievements; they are only allowed to oppose the Party and are not allowed to listen to the Party. Otherwise, they are "evil" and "mislead the Party and the country." Here, Hu Ming's trick of reversing right and wrong and confusing black and white is fully exposed. For the people's country, the Communist Party, which leads the core strength of the socialist cause, we need both praise and criticism. We should absolutely praise the Party's achievements and the successes of socialist construction. Are the Yangtze River Bridge, the Kangzang Highway, and the harnessing of the Yellow River, these great socialist construction projects, not worth praising? Is it not worth celebrating that our Beijing Normal University has developed from such a small scale before liberation to such a large scale, and moved from that narrow place outside Hepingmen to such a vast and completely new campus? Aren't these achievements the result of the Party's leadership? Only rightists and people with ulterior motives cannot see today's achievements, or see them but do not allow others to praise them, and call this due praise "flattery."

Here, Hu Ming equates "praise" with "flattery," thereby viciously slandering the Party as liking people who "flatter"; saying that the "Party organization" "trusts, encourages, and promotes" such people. Is this really the case? Today, in society and around the Party, there are indeed some people who have been deeply harmed by the old society, and they want to achieve their own shameful selfish desires by "flattering" the Party. But how does the Party treat such people? Comrade Liu Shaoqi clearly stated in his book "On the Self-Cultivation of Communists": The proletariat "despises others' unprincipled and excessive flattery, adulation, and fawning on themselves." He compared those who "flatter everywhere," "speak according to the person and the situation," and "trim their sails to the wind" to "bats," denouncing them as "neither donkey nor horse" and "double-dealers." How can it be said that the "Party organization" "trusts, encourages, and promotes" such people? Even in our Beijing Normal University, it is not difficult to find examples of being despised by the Party for "flattering" the Party. But I don't know anyone who has been "trusted, encouraged," and "promoted" by the Party solely by "flattering." I don't know what basis Hu Ming has for saying these words. There may be individual Party members who like others to flatter themselves, and this kind of thinking should be criticized. But Hu Ming is clearly talking about the "Party organization," not individual people within the Party. Here, Hu Ming's slander against the entire Party organization is clearest.

Hu Ming said that those who dare to criticize are righteous people. This statement also needs to be carefully analyzed. If it is said that one offers criticism and suggestions to the Party's work in good faith, that will be welcomed by the Party. The Party has always regarded those who offer suggestions in good faith as friends who care for the Party. People who offer good-faith criticism to the Party are often valued and respected by the Party, and will not be "attacked" as Hu Ming said. There are countless examples of this, and they can be found everywhere. I will give an example from my own personal experience. A Party member comrade in my unit is a member of the Normal University Party Committee. She once invited several non-Party staff members to give her suggestions, and several people frankly criticized her. She not only did not "attack" these people, but also said that such small meetings should be established as a system and held regularly. It can be seen how much the Party Committee comrades welcome everyone's criticism. In the previous period, in order to help the Party rectify its work style, teachers, students, and staff of the entire Normal University gave the Party many suggestions. Party Committee Secretary He Xilin repeatedly stated that the vast majority of the suggestions were good, including some opinions that were radically worded. Many suggestions have been accepted by the Party and are being used to improve the work of the Party and the school. The bungalow dormitory where I live has now been repaired with sewers, fitted with cold-proof windows, and inconvenient electrical switches have been moved. These were all problems raised during the rectification, and now they have been resolved. Doesn't this fact illustrate that the Party organization welcomes everyone's suggestions and criticism? Obviously, what Hu Ming is pursuing is not this kind of criticism, but using the name of "criticism" to engage in the reality of spreading rumors and slander; using the name of "working for the Party and the country" to engage in the reality of opposing the Party and opposing socialism. Hu Ming's words and deeds provide a strong annotation to the above conclusion.

Good intentions and malicious intentions seem difficult to distinguish, but there are fundamental differences. Professor Fu Ying of Peking University and Professor Liang Sicheng of Tsinghua University, judging from their articles published in the newspapers, made some very sharp, severe, and even harsh criticisms of the Party during the period of helping the Party rectify its work style. But no one has heard of anyone "attacking" them, and neither have they been identified as rightists by the masses or the Party. Now everyone is criticizing and refuting the words and deeds of the rightists, not because the rightists gave the Party too many suggestions or criticized too sharply. But because they want to fundamentally oppose the leadership of the Party, oppose the people, and oppose the socialist cause, their words and deeds are already sinful words and deeds. They deserve the severe condemnation and attack of the people of the whole country. The line between good-faith criticism and anti-Party sinful words and deeds must not be blurred.

Using the contrast between Feng Dao and Wen Tianxiang and Shi Kefa as an example to distinguish between evil and righteous intellectuals is Hu Ming's most insidious tactic. Speaking only of Wen Tianxiang and Shi Kefa, who would not want to learn from and emulate them? Who would say that these two national heroes are not righteous? The question is, who were Wen Tianxiang and Shi Kefa resisting, and to whom were they expressing their righteousness? Everyone knows that they sacrificed themselves generously and calmly for resisting foreign aggression. But during the rectification, who was Hu Ming encouraging the intellectual community to show this kind of righteousness to? Was it to American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek? No. When the evil winds were at their height, Hu Ming said these words, clearly inciting the intellectual community to uphold the integrity of the Kuomintang and attack the Party. He still thought in his mind that he was doing what Wen Tianxiang and Shi Kefa did, how sad and painful! How vicious is Hu Ming's method! Of course, Feng Dao, this Old Man of Chang Le, was not good and had no integrity. But what is wrong with old intellectuals who served the bourgeoisie during the Kuomintang rule, and after liberation, through study and transformation, are willing to honestly contribute to the construction of socialism in the people's era under the leadership of the Party? The Party welcomes all those who are willing to take the socialist road. The Party adopts a "promote their advancement" and "not blame the past" attitude towards old intellectuals. Although I am not considered old, I admit that when I was a teacher in the old society, I was full of bourgeois ideas, served the bourgeoisie, and actually consciously or unconsciously helped the society ruled by the Kuomintang. After liberation, after studying and being educated by social life, I realized the greatness of the socialist cause, and I am willing to follow the Communist Party and take the socialist road, with the spirit of "willing to be an ox for the people," and always be of one heart with the workers and peasants. I feel that this is glorious, and this is my progress. The rightist Hu Ming uses Feng Dao to slander us old intellectuals who came from the old society, regards intellectuals who follow the Party as shameless, and his reactionary position and malicious intention are obvious. What is exposed here is not others but Hu Ming himself. He chews on Marxist-Leninist words, wears a Marxist-Leninist coat, but expresses deep hatred for the people, for socialism, and for the Party. Therefore, it is not others who are shameless, but Hu Ming himself.

Hu Ming compares a part of the old intellectuals, especially the old intellectuals who are older and have more experience, to Feng Dao for supporting the Party and supporting socialism after liberation, and is conspiring to prevent these old intellectuals from ideological transformation, preventing them from continuing to move forward, and wanting them not to follow the Communist Party, not to lean towards the people, and to adhere to the position before liberation. This is to sow discord between the Party and the intellectuals, and this is a conspiracy to frame intellectuals who are willing to accept transformation but have not completed the transformation. We must be vigilant.

    驳“两种知识分子”论
    曹述敬
    北京师范大学在这次大鸣大放中，放出了许多妖魔鬼怪。他们在帮助党整风借口下，妖言惑众。其中右派分子胡明制造这么一种论调，说什么知识分子有两种，一种是误党误国的知识分子，只颂扬不批评，党组织却信任、鼓励、提拔；另一种是为党为国的知识分子。党对后一种人很难接近，往往排斥，甚至打击。
    他在另一次发言里，又说：中华民族自古以来就有两种知识分子。五代时有一个号称长乐老的冯道，做了十三个皇帝的臣子，经历了四个朝代，始终荣华富贵。这是无耻的知识分子的典型。另一类呢，像文天祥、史可法等，他们是有正义的知识分子的代表。前一种是误党误国的知识分子。他们惯于颂扬，他们很听话，这是一种邪恶的知识分子。后一种知识分子是为党为国的。他们敢于批评、揭露缺点，是正义的人。但被带上“打击领导”的罪名，打入冷宫。
    胡明这种说法，歪曲事实，举例不伦，当然是完全错误的。但因他用了“误党误国”和“为党为国”，“邪恶”和“正义”这种似乎是非分明的提法以及举出好坏绝不相同的历史人物来作比喻，是很易于迷惑人的。这些话的错误和恶毒性往往不是一下子就可以看得出来的。所以有分析批判之必要。
    首先，胡明把颂扬和批评对立起来，认为只要是谁颂扬党，颂扬社会主义的建设事业，谁就是“误党误国”的“邪恶”的知识分子。另一方面，谁只要敢于批评，敢于揭露党的缺点，就是“为党为国”的“正义”的知识分子。这就是说，知识分子只能说党不好，不许说党好；只许揭露党的缺点，不许颂扬党的功绩；只许反对党，不许听党的话。否则，就是“邪恶”和“误党误国”了。在这里，完全暴露出胡明颠倒是非、混淆黑白的鬼把戏。对于人民的国家，领导社会主义事业的核心力量共产党，我们既需要颂扬，也需要批评。我们对党的功绩，对社会主义建设事业的成绩是完全应该颂扬的。难道长江大桥、康藏公路、根治黄河，这些伟大的社会主义建设事业不值得歌颂吗？难道我们北京师大由解放前那样很小的规模，发展为这样大的规模；由和平门外那块狭小的地方迁到这样广大的全新的校址来，不值得我们高兴吗？难道这些成绩，不是党领导的结果？只有右派分子、别有用心的人，才看不见今天的成绩，或看见了而不许别人颂扬，并把这种应有的颂扬说成“阿谀奉承”。
    胡明在这里把“颂扬”和“阿谀奉承”混同起来，从而恶毒地诬蔑党喜欢“阿谀奉承”的人；说“党组织”对这种人“信任、鼓励、提拔”。这难道是事实吗？今天，在社会上，在党的周围，的确还有一些受旧社会遗害很深的人，他们想以对党“阿谀奉承”的办法，达到自己可耻的私愿。但党是怎么对待这样的人呢？刘少奇同志在“论共产党员的修养”一书里明白说过：无产阶级是“鄙视别人对自己无原则的过度的奉承、阿谀和谄媚”的。他把那些“到处逢迎”，“看人看势说话”，“顺风转舵”的人比作“蝙蝠”，斥为“非驴非马”，“两面三刀”的人。怎么能说“党组织”对这种人是“信任、鼓励、提拔”呢？就在我们北京师大要找出这种因“阿谀奉承”党而为党所鄙视的事例，也是不难的。但我不知道有谁是单靠“阿谀奉承”而受到党的“信任、鼓励”而且被“提拔”了的。不知胡明说这番话有什么根据。党员中也许有个别喜欢别人奉承自己的人，这种人的这种思想是应该受到批判的。但胡明明明说的是“党组织”，而不是说的党内个别的人。这里，胡明对整个党组织诬蔑，是最清楚不过了。
    胡明说，敢于批评的人就是正义的人。这话也得细加分析。如果说是善意地对党的工作提出批评，提出意见，那是会受到党的欢迎的。党一向是把善意提意见的人看作是爱护党的朋友。对党善意批评的人往往是受到党的重视和尊敬，而不是像胡明所说的那样会受到“打击”。这种例子不胜枚举，到处可以找到。我举一个我切身体会的例子。在我所属的单位的一位党员同志，是师大党委之一。她有一次曾约请几位党外的工作人员给她提意见，好几个人都坦率地对她进行了批评。她不但没有“打击”这些人，反而说应该把这样的小会作为一种制度，定期举行。可见党委同志们是如何欢迎大家的批评。前一个时期，为了帮助党整风，师大全校师生员工给党提了很多意见。党委书记何锡麟同志一再表示，绝大多数意见都是好的，包括一些言词偏激的意见在内。很多意见已为党所接受，正在据以改进党和学校的工作。我住的教职员工平房宿舍，现在修了下水道，装了冷布窗，移了不方便的电门。这都是在整风中提出来的问题，现在解决了。这不是以事实说明党组织是欢迎大家提意见，欢迎大家批评的吗？显然胡明追求的并不是这种批评，而是假借“批评”之名，行造谣诽谤之实；假借“为党为国”之名，行反党反社会主义之实。胡明的言行就给上述论断作了有力的注解。
    善意恶意看来颇难辨别，而却有原则的不同。北大教授傅鹰、清华教授梁思成，从报上发表的他们的文章看，他们在帮助党整风期间对党提的意见有的是十分尖锐，言词也是极其严峻，甚至尖刻的。但也没有听说谁“打击”他们，而且也没有被群众或党提出他们是右派分子。现在大家对右派分子的言行进行批判、驳斥，并不是说那个右派分子给党提的意见多了，批评得太尖锐了。而是因为他们要从根本上反对党的领导，反对人民，反对社会主义事业，他们的言行，已经是罪言罪行了。他们遭到全国人民的严厉的声斥和打击，是罪有应得的。善意的批评和反党的罪言罪行的界限是绝不容许模糊的。
    以冯道和文天祥、史可法的对比为例来区别邪恶和正义的知识分子，是胡明最阴险的手法。单说文天祥、史可法，谁不愿学习、效法？谁说这两位民族英雄不是正义的？问题在文天祥、史可法是反抗谁，他两人的正气是对谁表现的。谁都知道他们是为反抗异族侵略而慷慨牺牲，从容就义的。但胡明在整风中说这番话，是鼓动知识界向谁表现这种正义呢？是对美帝国主义和蒋介石吗？不是的。胡明在歪风正盛的时候，说这样的话，明明是煽惑知识界守国民党之节，向党进攻。还在精神上以为自己在做文天祥、史可法，这是多么可悲可痛啊！胡明的手段又是多么毒辣啊！冯道这个长乐老当然不好，没有气节。但旧知识分子在国民党统治时期为资产阶级服务，解放以后，经过学习、改造，愿意老老实实地在人民的时代，在党的领导下，为建设社会主义出一把力，这有什么不好？党是欢迎一切愿意走社会主义道路的人的。党对旧知识分子是抱着“与其进也”，“既往不咎”的态度。我虽然并不算老，但我承认在旧社会当教师教书，充满资产阶级思想，替资产阶级服务，实际上自觉或不自觉地是为国民党统治的社会帮了忙的。解放后，经过学习，受到社会生活的教育，认识了社会主义事业的伟大，我愿跟着共产党走社会主义的路，以“俯首甘为孺子牛”的精神，永远跟工农一条心，我觉得这是光荣的，这是我的进步。右派分子胡明拿冯道来诬蔑我们从旧社会来的旧知识分子，视跟着党走的知识分子无耻，其反动立场和用心之毒是显而易见的，在这里暴露了的不是别人正是胡明自己。他嘴里咀嚼着马列主义词句，身上披着马列主义外衣，而对人民对社会主义对党却表示深仇大恨。所以无耻的不是别人，正是胡明自己。
    胡明把一部分旧知识分子，特别是把年岁大，经历比较多的旧知识分子解放后拥护党、拥护社会主义比作是冯道，是阴谋阻止这些旧知识分子思想改造，阻止他们继续前进，是要他们不要跟着共产党走，不要向人民靠拢，坚持解放以前的立场。这是挑拨党和知识分子的关系，这是对愿意接受改造而未完成改造的知识分子的阴谋陷害。我们必须警惕。
