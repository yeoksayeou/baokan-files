Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 10th. The Shanghai China Democratic League (CDL) organization held a meeting of cadres at all levels on the 9th to expose and criticize the counter-revolutionary words and deeds of Peng Wenying, the deputy chairman of the Shanghai CDL Municipal Committee and a core member of the Zhang-Luo Alliance's Shanghai clique.

As soon as the rectification campaign began, Peng Wenying, under the guise of inspections and in the name of the Shanghai CDL leadership, went to factories, government offices, and grassroots CDL organizations to incite trouble. At the Shanghai CDL's general cadre meeting on May 14th, Peng Wenying, who was chairing the meeting, unleashed a torrent of poisonous arrows, declaring menacingly, "Today's meeting is a rally to pledge our determination, a grand march towards democracy," inciting people to attack the Party. He also discussed with Lu Yi turning the People's Square in the city center into a Hyde Park-style "free forum."

Peng Wenying also supported the rightist Lu Mang in his frenzied attacks on the Communist Party and activists who leaned towards the Party at the municipal propaganda conference. When Lu Mang showed his draft speech to Peng Wenying beforehand, Peng even complained that it was not strong enough. After Lu Mang's speech was met with opposition from many people, Peng Wenying not only immediately wrote an article in the newspaper supporting Lu Mang, but also secretly instigated members of other democratic parties to sign in support of him. At the same time, Peng Wenying wrote a letter to Zhao Wenbi, Luo Longji's confidant in Beijing, reporting on Lu Mang's speech, his own various anti-Party fallacies, and the "situation" in Shanghai, seeking credit from Luo Longji.

It was revealed that Peng Wenying and Luo Longji were from the same hometown, classmates, and had worked together. Since joining the CDL in 1946, he had become a member of Luo Longji's rightist clique. In Shanghai, he faithfully implemented Luo Longji's line, resisting the East China Executive Department of the CDL headquarters, headed by Shi Liang. He and other members of Luo Longji's clique, such as Chen Renbing, Zhao Wenbi, Sun Siming, Sun Dayu, Han Ming, Zhou Yongde, Cao Hongzhu, and Cheng Yingmiao, frequently gathered in secret to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party and to attack and squeeze out progressive elements within the League. By the time of the Shanghai CDL Municipal Committee's re-election in August 1956, Peng Wenying, Chen Renbing, Sun Siming, and others even adopted a method of assigning quotas for nominations to ensure that all rightist elements within the Shanghai League were brought out and seized leadership of the Shanghai CDL.

The meeting also revealed Peng Wenying's criminal acts of extorting money under the guise of being a "progressive democrat," as well as embezzling funds, illegally selling bank collateral, leaking state secrets for exorbitant profits, and dispatching thugs to forcibly occupy residential properties.

At the meeting on the 9th, Peng Wenying not only failed to seriously examine and confess his mistakes but instead openly boasted of his merits. Everyone was extremely angry at Peng Wenying's dishonest attitude and cited facts to refute his fallacies one by one. On the anti-rightist front,

    为章罗联盟打天下卖足气力
    彭文应是罗隆基的一等忠臣
    上海民盟组织举行干部大会进行揭发
    新华社上海10日电　上海民盟组织9日举行各级干部大会，揭发和批判章罗联盟在上海的小集团骨干分子、民盟上海市委副主任委员彭文应的反动言行。
    整风一开始，彭文应就借视察的名义和民盟上海市负责人的名义，到工厂、机关和民盟的基层组织点火。在5月14日上海民盟全体干部大会上，担任大会主席的彭文应更杀气腾腾地大放毒箭说：“今天这个大会是誓师大会，是向民主大进军”，煽动人们向党进攻。他还和陆诒商量，要把市中心的人民广场搞成海德公园式的“自由论坛”。
    彭文应还支持右派分子鲁莽在市宣传会议上疯狂攻击共产党和靠拢党的积极分子。鲁莽事先将发言稿给彭文应看时，彭还嫌火力不足。鲁莽发言后受到很多人的反对。彭文应不仅立刻在报上写文章支持鲁莽，还秘密策动其他党派成员签名支持他。同时，彭文应写信给北京罗隆基的亲信赵文璧，汇报鲁莽发言问题、自己发表的各种反党谬论和上海的“形势”向罗隆基邀功。
    据揭露，彭文应和罗隆基是同乡、同学，又同过事，自从1946年加入民盟后，就成为罗隆基右派小集团分子。在上海忠心执行罗隆基的路线，对抗以史良为首的民盟总部华东执行部。他和罗隆基小集团的陈仁炳、赵文璧、孙斯鸣、孙大雨、韩鸣、周永德、曹鸿翥、程应缪等人经常集会密谋，反对共产党的领导，打击和排挤盟内的进步分子。到1956年8月民盟上海市委改选时，彭文应和陈仁炳、孙斯鸣等更采取分别包干提名的方式，使上海盟内右派分子全部出笼，夺取了上海民盟的领导权。
    会上还揭露出彭文应挂着“进步民主人士”的招牌进行敲诈勒索以及抽逃资金、盗卖银行押品、泄露国家机密获取暴利、派出打手强占民房等犯罪行为。
    彭文应在9日的大会上不但不认真检查交代自己的错误，反而公然丑表功，大家对彭文应这种不老实的态度极为愤怒，纷纷举出事实逐一驳倒他的谬论。在反右派战线上
