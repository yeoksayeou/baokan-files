    A Tense Basketball Friendly
    Our Youth Team Defeats the Egyptian Team 85-79

    (Our Dispatch) The Egyptian basketball team, which is visiting our country at our invitation, held a friendly match with the Chinese Youth Basketball Team at the Beijing Gymnasium on the evening of the 19th. In the tense 40-minute match, the Chinese team won 85-79.

    The home team's starting lineup consisted of forwards Yang Boyong and Wang Lifa, center Zhang Fukui, and guards Zhang Xishan and Qian Chenghai. The visiting team featured Sami, a 1.95-meter tall and 96-kilogram center, another center named El, captain Raymond as forward, and George and Magdy as guards.

    The match proceeded in a constant climax. Zhang Xishan of the home team scored first with a free throw, taking a 1-0 lead. In less than a minute, Raymond of the visiting team responded with a basket under the net. After that, the two sides began a seesaw battle. The Egyptian team's strategy was to utilize their centers for scoring. Sami ran around the basket, while the second center, El, moved back and forth near the free-throw line. As soon as they got the ball, they would jump up and shoot. Forward Raymond also cut into the basket when he had the opportunity or occasionally made mid-range shots. The home team rebounded very fiercely. In particular, Sami not only tightly controlled his own basket but also almost monopolized the rebounds under the opponent's basket. There were frequent scenes where the Egyptian team missed three or four shots in a row, and finally, the center tapped the ball into the basket with his hand.

    The Chinese team used a man-to-man defense, trying to contain Sami and El, but without success. Fortunately, they executed fast breaks and outside screens, and their mid-range jump shots were relatively successful. Yang Boyong, Wang Lifa, and Zhang Xishan repeatedly contributed to the scoring, and the score difference between the two sides remained at two or three points. The audience's exclamations and applause rose and fell frequently. After tying at 34 and 36, the competition became even more intense. At the end of the first half, the Chinese team took the lead with a score of 38-37.

    In the second half, the home team replaced Zhang Fukui with Ju Fenkang and Zhang Xishan with Bai Jinshen. At this time, the fast breaks were more successful. Short passes often resulted in baskets under the opponent's net, and Yang Boyong's jump shots were also very effective, catching the visiting team off guard. Five minutes later, Sami of the visiting team was fouled out after five fouls. However, the visiting team's offensive did not weaken. El and Raymond often evaded the opponent's basket and scored easily after two or three skillful passes. At this time, El was also fouled out after five fouls. However, due to Raymond and Ahmed's successful sneak attacks with several long passes, the visiting team's score remained close, only two or three points behind.

    In the last three minutes, the match reached its climax. The score on the court was 77-73, with the Chinese team leading by four points. But at this moment, Liu Erzhu fouled carelessly, and Pehchini of the visiting team made two free throws, narrowing the gap to only one point. After the Chinese team took a timeout, Wang Lifa replaced Liu Erzhu and switched to a ball-control strategy. At this time, the Egyptian team was eager to grab the ball, but Bai Jinshen slipped past and scored. Then Zhang Guanglie and others made three free throws, bringing the score to 82-75. The Egyptian team requested a timeout and switched to a full-court press man-to-man defense. Raymond succeeded in scoring with a hook shot under the basket after receiving the ball, and Ahmed intercepted the ball and scored again, narrowing the gap to only three points. In the end, the visiting team committed two fouls due to their eagerness to grab the ball. He Shisun and Zhang Guanglie each made a free throw, ending the heart-pounding match with a score of 85-79.

    In this match, the highest scorer for the Egyptian team was captain Raymond, who scored 22 points. Center Sami scored 13 points in the first half (he was fouled out shortly after the start of the second half). For the Chinese team, Wang Lifa scored 18 points, and Yang Boyong scored 17 points.

    The Beijing Gymnasium, which can accommodate more than 7,000 people, was packed yesterday. Approximately 7,500 people watched this exciting match. (Guo An)

### 一场紧张的篮球友谊赛  我青年队以八十五比七十九胜埃及队

    一场紧张的篮球友谊赛
    我青年队以八十五比七十九胜埃及队
    本报讯　应邀来我国访问的埃及篮球队19日晚在北京体育馆与中国青年篮球队举行友谊比赛，在四十分钟的紧张比赛中，中国队以八十五比七十九取胜。
    主队上场的是前锋杨伯镛、王利发，中锋张福奎，后卫张锡山、钱澄海。客队以身高一公尺九十五公分、体重九十六公斤的沙米打中锋，另一中锋爱尔，队长瑞蒙德为前锋，乔治和马吉底为后卫。
    比赛始终在高潮中进行。主队张锡山罚中后以一比零首开记录，不到一分钟客队瑞蒙德在篮下还敬一球，此后双方即开始了拉锯战。埃及队的战术是利用中锋得分。沙米在篮下左右奔跑，第二中锋爱尔则来回于罚球线附近，两人一拿到球后即跳起投篮，前锋瑞蒙德有机会也往篮下切入，或偶然作中距离投篮。主队的篮板球抢夺得十分厉害，尤其是沙米除了紧紧控制自方的篮下外，还几乎包办了对方的篮下球，场上常常出现埃及队连投三、四次未中，最后被中锋用手拍进篮内的场面。
    中国队用人盯人的打法，看住沙米和爱尔，但未成功。幸而实行快攻和外围掩护，中距离跃起投篮打得还较顺利，杨伯镛、王利发、张锡山都一再建功，双方比分始终相差在二、三分之间。观众的惊呼声和掌声经常此起彼落。至三十四、三十六平后，双方竞争更激烈，上半时结束时，中国队以三十八比三十七占先。
    下半时主队鞠汾康替下张福奎、白金申替下张锡山，这时快攻打得较成功，常常几下短传便在对方篮下投入，杨伯镛的跳起投篮也得心应手，使得客队措手不及。五分钟后客队沙米五次犯规被罚下，但客队攻势未衰，爱尔、瑞蒙德常在两、三次巧妙的传递下，闪过对方篮下轻放得分。这时爱尔也五次犯规罚下，但由于瑞蒙德、阿赫默德几次远传偷袭成功，客队的比分始终紧随不差两、三分。
    到最后三分钟时，比赛进入了最高潮。场上比分为七十七比七十三，中国队领先四分。但这时刘二柱不小心犯规，客队培赫西尼罚中两球，追成只差一球。中国队暂停后，以王利发换下刘二柱，改打控制球战术。这时埃及队抢球心切，被白金申闪过投入，接着张光烈等又罚中三球成八十二比七十五。埃及队要求暂停，改打全场紧逼人盯人，果然瑞蒙德得手后篮下钩手投入，阿赫默德截球后又投入追成仅输三分。最后客队因抢球心切，两次犯规，被何诗荪、张光烈各罚进一球，以八十五比七十九结束这场扣人心弦的比赛。
    在这场比赛中埃及队得分最多的是队长瑞蒙德，一人独得二十二分，中锋沙米在上半时便得了十三分（下半时开赛不久即被罚下）。中国队王利发一人得十八分，杨伯镛得了十七分。
    能容纳七千多人的北京体育馆昨日挤得水泄不通，约有七千五百人观看了这场精彩比赛。（国安）（附图片）
