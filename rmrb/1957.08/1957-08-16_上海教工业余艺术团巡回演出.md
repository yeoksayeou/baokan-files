    Shanghai Educational and Industrial Amateur Art Troupe on Tour
    The Shanghai Educational and Industrial Amateur Art Troupe is using the summer vacation to conduct over sixty touring performances in batches to areas, schools, and grassroots trade unions where educational staff and workers are concentrated in the city. The purpose is to enrich the holiday cultural and recreational life of educational staff and workers and their families throughout the city and to promote the prosperity of amateur art activities among educational staff and workers.
    This amateur art troupe has been established for half a year, and is very large, with a chorus, orchestra, dance troupe, drama troupe, and Peking opera troupe. They have held a total of thirty-two summer report performances at the Shanghai Cultural Square, the Shanghai Art Theater, and other places from the end of July to the beginning of August.
