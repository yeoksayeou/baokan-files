Three Arsonists
Expose the Sinister Facts of *Guangming Daily* Reporters "Setting Fires" in Xi'an
By our reporter Zhu Bo

The people of Xi'an call the three reporters from *Guangming Daily* sent to Xi'an—Ou Zhipei, Zheng Xiaofeng, and Han Hongwen—three "arsonists."

Zheng Xiaofeng came to Xi'an in mid-April. Shortly after arriving, he contacted right-wing elements in the Xi'an area such as Wang Jiesan, Li Zhuangyou, and Liu Butong, and started setting fires everywhere.

On April 29th, Chu Anping sent Ou Zhipei and Han Hongwen to Xi'an. The *Guangming Daily*'s conspiracy to concentrate its efforts on "setting fires" in Xi'an was very obvious. These three actively organized symposiums in Xi'an to "ignite" things. They did not contact the provincial or municipal Party committee's United Front Work Department, emphasizing reliance on the democratic parties. However, several fair-minded people recommended by Zhang Guangyuan of the Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League to attend the symposium were not included. They relied on the rightist Li Zhuangyou. They asked Li Zhuangyou to introduce some people with many opinions and who dared to speak out to participate in the symposium. After several discussions, they determined the list of participants, with rightists in the majority.

After the list was finalized, Ou went to the United Front Work Department of the Xi'an Municipal Party Committee to go through the motions. Quan Binghua, the deputy director of the United Front Work Department, saw the list and suggested that some people lacked representation and that more representative people should be added. Ou emphasized that the list had been determined after repeated discussions with the democratic parties and rejected Quan's suggestion. Deputy Director Quan still advised him to discuss it with the democratic parties again. Ou still did not accept this suggestion. But after leaving the United Front Work Department, Ou instead told people that the list of participants for the symposium was approved by the Municipal Party Committee's United Front Work Department.

In order to launch this first shot successfully, and to make this fire burn faster, Ou, Han, and others, with the assistance of the rightist Li Zhuangyou, also conducted individual interviews with the invited people to understand the content of their speeches, and to mobilize and encourage these attendees. In front of many people, they boasted about *Guangming Daily* and deliberately slandered *People's Daily*.

During the individual interviews, those who had no opinions about the Party were disqualified from being invited. For example, Professor Zhang Tonghe of Xi'an Medical College, they learned from Li Zhuangyou that Zhang Tonghe had many opinions and had included him as a potential invitee. When Ou Zhipei interviewed Zhang Tonghe, he asked, "I heard that your successfully tested 'prefrontal lobotomy' was suppressed by the Party committee?" Zhang said, "That's not the case. The Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee, the Xi'an Municipal Party Committee, and the college Party committee have been very supportive of me. I am still performing this surgery; it's just that some of our colleagues oppose this surgery." After hearing Zhang say this, Ou didn't say anything else and removed Zhang Tonghe from the list of invitees.

The symposium was held on the afternoon of May 4th and lasted until 10 p.m. Ou Zhipei called on the participants at the symposium to "say whatever you want. Because it is a rectification campaign, mainly raise shortcomings, don't talk about advantages. You dare to speak, we dare to publish. Don't be afraid of retaliation; *Guangming Daily* will definitely stand up for you." Ou also said, "There are no Party members at today's meeting. This is so that you can speak freely, so Party members were not invited"… Ou also boasted about Chu Anping.

This was the most vicious meeting in which rightists in the Xi'an area attacked the Party. At the meeting, rightists Wang Jiesan (professor at Xi'an Normal College), Liu Butong, Li Shuli (both professors at Northwest University), Qian Zhujun (associate professor at Northwest University), Wang Ziyun (professor at Xi'an Academy of Fine Arts) and others wantonly slandered the Party's leadership, the Party's united front policy, and the Party's achievements in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement (details, see *Guangming Daily*, May 11th and 12th). The rightist Qian Zhujun even arrogantly asserted in his speech that the Party would collapse in the coming year or two (this sentence was deleted by Qian Zhujun after the meeting). The rightists also cheered and echoed each other's reactionary remarks. Ou, Zheng, and others greatly admired the rightists' crazy demeanor. They talked and laughed with the rightists and seemed very close. But they were cold to those who were more fair-minded. For example, when Li Weilin, a professor at Northwest Russian College, briefly talked about achievements in his speech, Han Hongwen said impatiently:
"What's the point of this?" Rightists Liu Butong and Wang Jiesan even criticized Liu Weitong, a professor at Xi'an Medical College, on the spot, saying: "Your speech doesn't have many opinions about the Communist Party and has no substance!" When Liu Weitong, Li Weilin, and others recalled the situation at the symposium at the time, they said that the rightists were very arrogant at the meeting. They gestured, talked loudly, and were very proud of themselves. Ou Zhipei, Zheng Xiaofeng, and Han Hongwen of *Guangming Daily* were also very proud, often whispering to the rightists, and repeatedly toasting everyone during the meal. The rightists believed it was a successful meeting. They were very grateful to *Guangming Daily*, calling *Guangming Daily* "their own newspaper." Liu Butong said, "Today's meeting really made everyone talk comfortably. I didn't expect there would be today. If it were two years ago, people would definitely say that we are part of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique." The symposium lasted until after 10 p.m. But the rightists showed no fatigue. Wang Jiesan said excitedly: "I wouldn't feel tired even if such meetings continued!"

After the minutes of the symposium were published in *Guangming Daily*, it caused a great shock among people from all walks of life in the Xi'an area. Some upright people expressed great dissatisfaction, and they called the Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League to question whether they knew about this. Those rightists, after seeing *Guangming Daily*, were overjoyed. Rightists in some schools called the news organizations in the Xi'an area to question why they didn't report their "blooming and contending," saying that the Party newspaper was not as good as *Guangming Daily*, and that the Party newspaper did not have freedom of the press. The rightists who participated in the symposium became even more arrogant after the meeting. Wang Jiesan "set fires" everywhere, and everywhere made anti-Party remarks. Liu Butong, Li Shuli, Qian Zhujun, and others became major rightists. Especially Liu Butong, he carried out activities in Northwest University, becoming the commander of the rightists at Northwest University.

The task of the three "arsonists" from *Guangming Daily* sent to Xi'an was completed, but the people of the Xi'an area will not allow the anti-Party flames to spread. Now, in the struggle to counter the rightists, the steadfast people have become more steadfast, and those who were deceived in the past have now awakened. Everyone is united to wage a resolute struggle against the rightists.

    三个纵火犯
    揭露光明日报记者在西安“点火”的罪恶事实
    本报记者　朱波
    西安的人民把光明日报派到西安来的三个记者——欧至培、郑笑枫和韩洪文叫作三个“纵火犯”。
    郑笑枫是4月中旬来西安的。他来西安不久，就和西安地区的右派分子王捷三、李壮猷、刘不同等取得了联系，四处点火。
    4月29日，储安平又派欧至培和韩洪文来到西安，光明日报集中力量要在西安“点火”的阴谋是十分明显了。这三个人在西安积极组织座谈会“点火”。他们没有和省、市委统战部联系，强调要依靠民主党派。但是，民盟省委张光远向他们介绍的出席座谈会的几个公正人士，却不被吸收参加。他们依靠的是右派分子李壮猷。他们要求李壮猷介绍一些意见多而又敢说话的人参加座谈会。经过他们数次商量，决定了座谈会的名单。其中右派分子占了多数。
    名单确定后，欧曾到中共西安市委统战部去走了一下“过场”。统战部权秉华副部长看到名单后，曾向他提出，有些人没有什么代表性，应该增加一些有代表性的人士，欧却强调说名单是和各民主党派再三研究确定的，拒绝权的建议。权副部长还是劝他再和各民主党派商量一下。欧仍然没有接受这个意见。但是欧从统战部出来后，反而对人说座谈会的名单是市委统战部同意的。
    欧、韩等为了把这一炮打响，为了使这把火能更快地燃起来，在右派分子李壮猷协助下，又对约请的人进行了个别访问，了解他们发言的内容，并且对这些出席会议的人进行动员鼓动工作。他们在很多人面前，把光明日报吹嘘了一番，有意地污蔑人民日报。
    在个别访问中，那些对党没有意见的人，又被取消了被约请的资格。如西安医学院的张同和教授，他们从李壮猷那里了解张同和有很多意见，曾列为被约请的对象。欧至培访问张同和时问张，“听说你试验成功的‘前额叶切断术’，曾受到党委的压制？”张说，“没有这回事，陕西省委、西安市委以及学院党委都非常支持我，我现在还在动这个手术；就是我们同行中有些人反对这个手术。”欧听张一说，再没有谈什么，就把张同和从被约请的名单上抹掉了。
    座谈会是5月4日下午开的，一直开到夜十时才结束。欧至培在这个座谈会上号召参加的人“有什么说什么。因为是整风，主要提缺点，不要谈优点，你们敢说，我们敢登，不要骇怕打击报复，光明日报一定为你们作主撑腰。”欧还说“今天这个会没有党员，这是为了畅所欲言，所以不约请党员”……欧还为储安平吹嘘了一番。
    这是西安地区右派分子向党进攻中最恶毒的一次会。会上，右派分子王捷三（西安师范学院教授），刘不同、李述礼（都是西北大学教授）、钱祝钧（西北大学副教授）、王子云（西安美专教授）等人肆意诬蔑党的领导、党的统战政策，以及党在肃反运动等方面的成就（详细内容，请看5月11日、12日光明日报），右派分子钱祝钧在发言中还非常狂妄地断言说党在明年后年就要垮台（这句话在会后被钱祝钧删掉了）。右派分子还互相为他们的反动言论喝彩、帮腔。欧、郑等人非常欣赏右派分子那种疯狂的姿态，他们和右派分子说说笑笑，显得非常亲密。但对那些较公正的人士就冷淡了。例如西北俄专教授李蔚麟在发言中概括地谈了一下成绩，韩洪文就很不耐烦地说：
  “这有啥意思。”右派分子刘不同、王捷三竟当场就批评西安医学院教授刘蔚同说：“你的发言对共产党的意见并不多，没有什么内容！”刘蔚同、李蔚麟等人回忆起当时座谈会的情形时说，会议上右派分子十分嚣张，他们指手划脚，高谈阔论，洋洋得意。光明日报的欧至培、郑笑枫、韩洪文也很得意，常和右派分子交头接耳，并在中途吃饭时，再三向大家敬酒。右派分子认为这是成功的会。他们非常感激光明日报，称光明日报是“自己的报纸”。刘不同说，“今天的会议真使大家谈的舒服，想不到会有今天，要是前二年，人家一定会说我们这些人是胡风反党集团了。”座谈会一直开到夜十时多才结束。但是右派分子都毫无倦容。王捷三兴奋地说：“这样的会再开下去也感觉不到疲倦！”
    座谈会的记录在光明日报上公布之后，在西安地区各界人士当中震动很大。一些正直的人们都表示非常不满，他们打电话质问民盟省委，是否知道这件事情。而那些右派分子看到光明日报后，则欢欣若狂。有些学校的右派分子曾给西安地区的新闻单位打电话，质问为什么不报道他们的“鸣放”，说党报不如光明日报，党报没有新闻自由。而参加座谈会的右派分子，在会后更嚣张，王捷三到处“放火”，到处发表反党言论，刘不同、李述礼、钱祝钧等都成了主要右派分子。特别是刘不同，他在西北大学大肆活动，成为西大右派分子的主帅。
    光明日报派到西安来的三个“纵火犯”的任务是完成了，但是，西安地区的人民却不允许反党火焰蔓延下去。现在，在反击右派斗争中，坚定的人们更加坚定了，过去那些受迷惑的人现在也清醒了，大家都团结在一起，向右派分子进行坚决的斗争。
