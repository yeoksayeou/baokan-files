Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 14th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Xu Fangyi reports: A capitalist countercurrent worthy of vigilance has emerged among private personnel in Shanghai's joint state-private enterprises. According to recent investigations by relevant departments, private personnel and small business owners in many industries have privately established "spontaneous factories." Although they have participated in joint state-private ownership, they have not transformed themselves well and still long for the capitalist road, even at the expense of harming joint ventures to satisfy private interests.

These private personnel and small business owners who privately establish "spontaneous factories" often operate in a hidden way, with their relatives and friends coming forward to manage them. Their products range from baby bibs to machine tools used in factories, with poor product quality and high prices, with profits as high as tenfold or more.

They even resort to illegal means such as embezzlement and theft to obtain funds, equipment, and raw materials, not hesitating to ruin joint state-private enterprises. For example, Zhao Zhenhua, a private staff member of the jointly owned Jianping Iron and Steel Factory, used his position to procure raw materials only for his own "spontaneous factory." In August of last year, the joint venture was forced to shut down due to a cutoff in raw material supply, while the "spontaneous factory" opened by Zhao Zhenhua and others grew from seven or eight people to more than twenty. Wu Gengxi, a private staff member of the Guangming Arts and Crafts Cooperative in the cultural and educational supplies industry, on the one hand, arranged for three relatives to work in the factory, drawing salaries of three to four hundred yuan per month; on the other hand, he introduced Guangming Factory's orders to a "spontaneous factory" privately established by his wife. As a result, Guangming Factory's turnover fell from 5,000 yuan per month in October of last year to just over 1,000 yuan at the beginning of this year.

Private personnel and small business owners who privately establish "spontaneous factories" sometimes openly steal the machinery, equipment, raw materials, and funds of joint state-private enterprises to carry out their illegal activities. Rong Qixiang and Gu Gao, two private personnel from the Zhongzhu Steel Factory, stole assets such as pig iron, silicon iron, copper pots, sandboxes, and crucibles from the joint venture factory and misappropriated more than 2,000 yuan of enterprise funds to set up a workshop outside the factory to manufacture acid-resistant silicon iron pots. In the rotary motor, petroleum machinery, and knitting industries, it was also discovered that the machinery and equipment of some private personnel's privately established "spontaneous factories" had been deliberately hidden by them during the enterprise's downsizing and reorganization. In the lock, instrument, and printing industries, it was also discovered that many private personnel and small business owners were stealing the product trademarks and design drawings of joint state-private factories.

Private personnel and small business owners who privately establish "spontaneous factories" mostly attract some workers with high wages, using the evenings to produce their own products, and some even require workers to work all night. As a result, some joint venture factories have experienced lax labor discipline, such as workers arriving late, leaving early, and being absent from work, as well as a decline in labor productivity and yield rates. The Eastern Industrial Cooperative in the telecommunications and electrical appliance industry only completed 60% of its plan in June, despite a normal supply of raw materials. The rejection rate in the abrasive industry increased by about 5% compared to last year. The Zhiguo Machine Factory in the textile machinery industry originally produced 25 flat knitting machines per month, but now it has dropped to 18 or 19, and the enterprise loses money every month. Some private personnel in joint venture factories even mix privately accepted orders with joint venture orders and hand them over to workers for production, illegally exploiting workers' labor.

When the right-wing elements were rampantly carrying out anti-socialist clamoring, some private personnel and small business owners in Shanghai's joint state-private enterprises became even more active in engaging in capitalist restoration activities, with some openly shouting, "I want to create my own free world." Some took the opportunity to openly propose withdrawing from joint state-private ownership.

At present, the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee has paid serious attention to this capitalist countercurrent and has formulated measures to deal with private personnel and small business owners privately establishing "spontaneous factories." Relevant business departments are also taking corresponding measures based on different circumstances. The industrial and commercial administrative departments, in conjunction with relevant units, have ordered the closure of some "spontaneous factories" opened by some private personnel and small business owners using the names and equipment of joint venture enterprises. The judicial organs have also arrested some private personnel and small business owners who have committed serious illegal acts in accordance with the law.

### 一股值得警惕的资本主义逆流  上海一些资本家私设工厂盗窃资财抗拒改造  严重违法分子已被逮捕，某些“自发工厂”已被勒令停业

    一股值得警惕的资本主义逆流
    上海一些资本家私设工厂盗窃资财抗拒改造
    严重违法分子已被逮捕，某些“自发工厂”已被勒令停业
    新华社上海14日电　新华社记者徐方义报道：上海公私合营企业私方人员中出现了一股值得引起警惕的资本主义逆流。根据各有关部门最近的调查，在许多行业中都有一些中小型合营企业的私方人员和小业主私自开设“自发工厂”。他们虽然参加了公私合营，但并没有很好的改造自己，至今仍留恋资本主义的道路，甚至不惜损害合营企业以满足私利。
    这些私设“自发工厂”的私方人员和小业主往往用隐蔽的方式，用自己的亲属、朋友出面经营。他们的产品小至婴孩的围涎、大至工厂应用的机床都有，产品质量低劣，售价也高，利润最高有十多倍。
    他们甚至采取贪污、盗窃等等违法手段来获取资金、设备和原料，不惜搞垮公私合营企业。如，公私合营建平制铁厂私方人员赵振华利用职务上的便利，只是为自己的“自发工厂”采购原料。去年8月，合营厂因原料供应断绝被迫停工，而赵振华等开设的“自发工厂”却从七、八人发展到二十多人。文教用品业的光明工艺社私方人员吴赓西，一方面安插了三个亲戚在厂里，每月支取薪金三、四百元；一方面又把光明厂的定货介绍给由他妻子出面私设的“自发工厂”去做。结果，使光明厂的营业额由去年10月份的每月五千元降到今年年初的一千多元。
    私设“自发工厂”的私方人员和小业主，有的公然盗用公私合营企业的机器设备、原料和资金来干他们的违法勾当。中铸钢铁厂私方人员荣启祥、顾高两人，偷盗合营厂内的生铁、硅铁、铜锅、砂箱、坩锅等资产，并挪用企业资金二千多元，在厂外私设工场，制造耐酸硅铁锅。旋转电机、石油机械、针织等行业也发现部分私方人员私设“自发工厂”的机器设备，是他们在企业裁并改组的时候，故意隐匿下来的。制锁、仪表、印刷等行业还发现不少私方人员和小业主盗用公私合营厂的产品商标和设计图样。
    私设“自发工厂”的私方人员和小业主，大都以高额工资拉拢部分在业工人，利用晚上来生产自己的产品，有的甚至要工人通宵干活。因此，有些合营厂出现了工人迟到、早退、旷工等劳动纪律松弛和劳动生产率、成品率下降的现象。电讯电器业的东方工业社在6月份原料供应正常的情况下，只完成计划60％。砂轮业的废品比去年增加了约5％。纺织机械业的志国机器厂原来每月生产横机二十五台，现在已经下降到十八、九台，企业月月亏本。有的合营厂私方人员甚至把私人接受的订货混在合营企业的订货中，交给工人生产，非法剥削工人劳动。
    当右派分子猖狂地进行反社会主义叫嚣的时候，上海公私合营企业中的部分私方人员和小业主搞资本主义的复辟活动更加积极，有人公开叫嚣：“我要搞我的自由天地。”有的趁此公开提出要退出公私合营。
    目前，上海市人民委员会对于这股资本主义的逆流已经引起了严重注意，并且拟订了对私方人员和小业主私设“自发工厂”的处理办法。有关的业务部门也正在根据不同的情节采取相应的措施。工商行政管理部门会同有关单位，对某些私方人员、小业主盗用合营企业名义和设备开设的“自发工厂”，已经勒令停业。司法机关也依法逮捕了一些犯有严重违法行为的私方人员和小业主。
