American Dark Side

    The FBI recently reported that the number of mobile, recidivist criminals in the United States has reached as high as three million. American judicial authorities feel helpless about how to reduce this number of criminals. Even more serious is the problem of juvenile delinquency. Currently, there are approximately one million juvenile delinquents in the United States, with about 600,000 already imprisoned. Most of them are incarcerated with adult criminals. In prison, they are influenced by habitual offenders, murderers, and hooligans. When they are released from prison, they not only show no remorse but, on the contrary, are even more skilled at committing crimes.

    社会犯罪问题严重
    据美国联邦调查局最近统计，美国各地流动性、屡犯不改的罪犯数达三百万名之多。美国司法当局对如何减少这一批罪犯人数的问题感到束手无策。更严重的是少年罪犯问题。目前，美国少年罪犯约有一百万名，其中已被关进监狱的约计有六十万名。他们大多与成人罪犯关在一起。在监狱里又受到惯匪、杀人犯、流氓的熏染，当他们被释放出狱的时候，不但毫无悔悟，相反的，为非作歹的本领更加高明了。
