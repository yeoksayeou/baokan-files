British Authorities Should Respect the Rights of Chinese Residents in Kowloon
By Our Commentator
    On August 6, the British government responded to our Foreign Ministry's note of protest on July 24 regarding the Hong Kong British authorities' forced relocation of Chinese residents in Kowloon, demolition of houses, and flattening of fields and orchards. In this reply, the British government not only did not accept the solemn protest and reasonable demands put forward by our government, but also spared no effort to distort the facts and attempted to conceal and shirk the responsibility that the Hong Kong British authorities should bear for this measure that seriously damages the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese residents in Kowloon. This attitude of the British government can only arouse greater indignation among Chinese residents in Hong Kong and Kowloon and the entire Chinese people.
    In its reply, the British government described the Hong Kong British authorities' barbaric demolition measures, which forced Kowloon residents into bankruptcy and displacement, as an "action purely based on humanitarianism," with the majority of residents being "very satisfied" and "cooperating" with them. This is a completely untrue statement. The obvious fact is that, as pointed out in our Foreign Ministry's note, this measure by the Hong Kong British authorities was carried out despite strong protests and opposition from local Chinese residents. As early as January of this year, when the Hong Kong British authorities revealed the demolition plan for Chuk Yuen Village, residents of Chuk Yuen and other thirteen villages jointly organized the "Joint Support Association of Thirteen Villages in Kowloon to Support Chuk Yuen Villagers" to oppose this plan that would harm their vital interests. They appealed to society and negotiated with the Hong Kong authorities many times, demanding that the demolition be stopped and that a solution be negotiated. This is a fact that is obvious to residents of Hong Kong and Kowloon. Due to their strong opposition and the sympathy and support of Chinese residents in Hong Kong and Kowloon, the Hong Kong authorities once postponed the implementation of the demolition plan, but the Hong Kong authorities never faced up to their legitimate rights and reasonable demands, refused to negotiate a solution, and finally took coercive demolition measures, disregarding the industries that the residents had worked hard to build up over many years and their livelihoods. What "cooperation" and "great satisfaction" could the Chinese residents of Hong Kong have with this?
    The British government's claim in its reply that it was an "action purely based on humanitarianism" is an even greater lie. The Hong Kong authorities claimed that the demolition of Chuk Yuen Village was to build resettlement housing for residents, but as the Joint Support Association of Thirteen Villages repeatedly mentioned when negotiating with the Hong Kong authorities, there are vast open spaces within and outside Chuk Yuen and other ten villages where buildings can be built. Why is it necessary to demolish the area where tens of thousands of residents of Chuk Yuen Village have settled? Can it be said that this is in line with "humanitarianism"? During the demolition process, the Hong Kong authorities dispatched hundreds of armed police officers to deal with residents who could not bear to leave their homes with brutal and fierce means, forcibly driving them out of their homes and damaging their property, leaving many residents bankrupt and displaced. They suffered incalculable losses both materially and spiritually, and some women even became mentally disturbed as a result of this heavy blow. What kind of "humanitarian" spirit is this? In its reply, the British government also mentioned preparing to provide compensation for some land and houses. However, it is reported that not only are the announced compensation standards extremely unfair and unacceptable to the affected residents, but the Hong Kong authorities also intend not to provide compensation for the loss of land and houses for most residents under the pretext of "illegality." What kind of "humanitarian" spirit is this?
    In its reply, the British government emphasized that the Wong Tai Sin demolition area, which is currently "part of the Hong Kong government's plan," is only inhabited by 7,000 people, and that the area north and east of Kowloon City (i.e., the area of the ten villages mentioned in our Foreign Ministry's note) is not being widely demolished. This statement by the British government is also not in accordance with the facts. According to the representatives of the ten villages in Kowloon at a press conference on April 14, the initial demolition plan of the Hong Kong authorities affected not 7,000 people, but 20,000 people. As for the ten villages area, a spokesperson for the Hong Kong authorities also publicly admitted on April 6 that "appropriate development will also be carried out in the end," and in fact, the later phase of the plan announced by the Hong Kong authorities also includes villages such as Ngau Chi Wan, Ping Tin, and Sha Tin Yuen. At the same time, the Hong Kong authorities have sent personnel to conduct surveys in other areas of the ten villages. Although the British government's reply admits that the demolition area currently underway is only part of the entire plan, it deliberately reduces the size of the demolition area and the number of affected residents in an attempt to dilute the seriousness of the issue. This attempt is also in vain.
    The British government's reply even absurdly and unreasonably stated that the Chinese government's protests and demands are "interfering in the internal affairs of another government." This is a completely unfounded slander. It must be pointed out that more than 95% of the residents of Hong Kong and Kowloon are Chinese. They demand to live a peaceful life of security and contentment. The Chinese government cannot turn a blind eye to the unreasonable infringement of the traditional rights and peaceful life of Chinese residents in Hong Kong and Kowloon. The Chinese government has the responsibility and the right to demand that the British government respect and protect the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese residents in Hong Kong and Kowloon. The so-called "interference in internal affairs" is completely unfounded.
    The Chinese people are very concerned about their compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon. We firmly support the protests and demands put forward by our Foreign Ministry on July 24. The Hong Kong British authorities must immediately stop implementing the unreasonable measures of forcibly relocating Chinese residents and destroying their houses and farmland property, and provide proper resettlement for the Chinese residents who have been forcibly relocated, and provide fair compensation for the loss of their houses and farmland property. The Chinese people are closely watching the actions of the Hong Kong British authorities.

### 英国当局应尊重九龙中国居民的权益

　　英国当局应尊重九龙中国居民的权益
　　本报评论员
    8月6日英国政府对我外交部7月24日抗议香港英国当局强迫九龙中国居民迁移和拆毁民房，铲平田园、果木的照会提出了复照。在这个复照中，英国政府不仅没有接受我国政府提出的严正抗议和合理要求，反而不惜颠倒是非，歪曲事实真相，企图掩饰和推诿香港英国当局对这一严重损害九龙中国居民正当权益的措施所应负的责任。英国政府的这种态度只能引起港九中国居民和全中国人民的更大的愤慨。
    英国政府在复照中把香港英国当局迫使九龙居民毁家破产、流离失所的横蛮无理的拆迁措施，说成是“纯由人道主义出发的行动”，大多数居民“甚感满意”，而且得到他们的“合作”。这是完全不符合事实的说法。明摆着的事实是，正如我外交部照会中所指出的，香港英国当局这一措施是在不顾当地中国居民强烈抗议和反对下进行的。早在今年1月间，当香港英国当局透露竹园乡拆迁计划以后，竹园等十三乡居民为了反对这个损害他们切身权益的计划，共同组织了“九龙十三乡联合支援竹园村民会”。他们多次向社会呼吁，向香港当局进行交涉，要求停止拆迁，要求协商解决。这是港九居民有目共睹的事实。由于他们的强烈反对和港九中国居民的同情和支援，香港当局虽然将拆迁计划一度延期执行，但是香港当局始终未肯正视他们的正当权益和合理要求，拒绝协商解决，最后竟然采取强迫拆迁的措施，置居民多年辛勤建立的产业和他们的生计于不顾。香港中国居民对此有什么“合作”和“甚为满意”可言呢？
    英国政府复照中所谓“纯由人道主义出发的行动”更是极大的谎言。香港当局声称拆迁竹园乡是为了盖造徙置楼房供居民居住，但正如十三乡联合支援会同香港当局交涉时屡次提到的，在竹园等十乡以内和以外都有广阔的空地可以建造楼房，为什么非要把竹园乡定居数万居民的地区拆毁不可呢？难道说，这是符合于“人道主义”的吗？在拆迁过程中，香港当局出动数百名武装警察以残暴凶狠的手段对付那些不忍离开家园的居民，把他们强赶出门，损毁他们的财产，使许多居民陷入毁家破产、流离失所的境地，他们物质上、精神上都遭受了不可估量的损失，在此重大打击下有的妇女甚至因而精神失常。这是什么“人道主义”精神呢？在复照中，英国政府还提到准备对一部分土地和房屋给予赔偿金。但据悉，不但已经宣布的赔偿标准极不公平，为受损居民所不愿接受，而且香港当局还打算在“非法”的借口下对大部分居民的土地和房屋损失都不准备给予赔偿。这又是什么“人道主义”精神呢？
    英国政府在复照中强调说目前“作为香港政府计划一部分”的黄大仙拆除地区仅仅居住七千人，并非像我外交部照会中所提到的九龙城以北和以东的地带（按即指我外交部照会中所提十乡地区）都准备予以广泛拆除。英国政府的这种说法也是不符合事实的。据九龙十乡代表4月14日在记者招待会所宣称，香港当局的初期拆迁计划所影响到的居民不是七千人，而是二万人。至于十乡地区，香港当局发言人4月6日也曾公开承认“最后亦将作适当的发展”，而且实际上，在香港当局所宣布的后一期计划中也还包括牛池湾、坪顶和沙地园等乡地区，同时，在十乡中的其他地区香港当局已经派员进行了测量。英国政府复照中虽然承认目前进行拆迁的地区仅是整个计划的一部分，但又故意缩小拆迁地区和受到影响的居民人数，以图冲淡问题的严重性。这种企图也是枉费心机的。
    英国政府的复照竟荒谬无理地说中国政府的抗议和要求是“干涉另一个政府的内政”。这完全是无端的诽谤。必须指出，港九居民中95％以上都是中国人。他们要求过着安居乐业的和平生活。中国政府对于港九中国居民的传统权益和和平生活遭受无理侵害，不能不闻不问。中国政府有责任也有权利要求英国政府尊重和保障港九中国居民的正当权益。所谓“干涉内政”的说法是完全没有根据的。
    中国人民对港九同胞十分关怀。我们坚决拥护我外交部7月24日所提出的抗议和要求。香港英国当局必须立即停止执行强迫中国居民迁移和毁坏他们的房屋和田园财产的无理措施，并且对已经被强迫迁移的中国居民给予妥善的安置，对他们的房屋和田园财产的损失给予公平的赔偿。中国人民密切地注视着香港英国当局的行动。
