Exposing the Ugly Face of Luo Longji, Head of the Rightists of the China Democratic League
China Democratic League Central Standing Committee Member Chu Tunan

Luo Longji, the head of the rightists in the China Democratic League, often boasted that he was "skilled at using words to cover up mistakes and intelligent enough to disguise faults." Therefore, his dirty history of social relations and political life, as well as his ugly face in daily life, have always been concealed from most people. Thus, he could carry out a series of conspiracies under various disguises and covers. However, due to Luo Longji's greed for profit blinding his judgment and his becoming dizzy with success, his conspiracies and ugly face have finally been exposed. His consistent anti-Party, anti-socialist words and deeds, and his consistent pro-American, anti-Soviet activities, are programmatic, planned, and organized, and are historical, and therefore even more vicious. In order to draw a clear ideological line and safeguard the great cause of socialist construction, the people of the whole country have the right to expose his ugly face and conspiracies from all aspects, and also have the right to demand that he thoroughly confess and thoroughly be frank to the people of the whole country.

(I) Starting from Luo Longji's Family Background, Education, and Social Relations

From Luo Longji's family background, social relations, and the Anglo-American bourgeois education he received, Luo Longji's anti-communist, anti-socialist thoughts, words, and actions have very deep roots.

Luo Longji was born into a landlord family in Fengtian Township, Anfu County, Jiangxi Province. His elder brother, the local tyrant and landlord Luo Muzeng, lived by collecting rent and exploiting farmers before liberation, and relied on Luo Longji's influence to extort money everywhere. During the land reform, Luo Longji always attempted to maintain the illegal landlord family and harbored resentment against the just actions of the peasants. According to the exposure of the members of the Chetan Agricultural Cooperative in Fengtian Township, Luo Longji once instructed his brother Luo Zhaorui to write a letter from Beijing to the township government, threatening: "What regulations are you basing on when you classify Luo Muzeng as a landlord and confiscate his property? Reply quickly." The members also revealed that when Luo Longji returned home the year before last summer, he never asked what benefits the farmers had gained under the leadership of the Party. When talking to others, he always asked with ulterior motives what was bad about collectivization and what was bad about unified purchase and sales. He also liked to talk to landlords, Kuomintang members, and his "good relatives" and "old friends." Luo Longji expressed his opinions about collectivization and dissatisfaction with the unified purchase and sales policy, originally to speak for these people. Therefore, his conspiracies not only occurred among urban intellectuals, but also extended his tentacles to bad elements in the countryside, attempting to use this as political capital to blackmail and deceive, confuse right and wrong, and shake people's hearts.

From Luo Longji's historical social relations, it can also be seen that his anti-communist and anti-socialist stance has historical roots. When he studied in the United States, he organized some believers in statism to form the Dajiang Society. After returning to China, he joined the National Socialist Party, ran "New Moon," edited Yishibao, and accepted money from the Japanese to run an economic research institute in Tianjin. Therefore, in 1936, he did not support national unity against Japan. At that time, Luo Longji published an article announcing his proposition, which was the same as the traitorous and pro-Japanese proposition of Wang Kemin and others, namely, the so-called special nature of North China. His reason was that "Since Japan asks the Kuomintang to withdraw from North China, why not let our various parties and factions do it." Later, because the Pacific War broke out, and Germany and Japan declared war on Britain and the United States, Luo Longji, who was pro-American, only stood on the side of the anti-Japanese war from this time on. At this time, he further colluded with American imperialists such as Marshall, Wedemeyer, and Stuart, hoping that the United States would support the third force to replace Chiang Kai-shek and enslave the Chinese people. Therefore, the main people related to Luo Longji were some bureaucratic bourgeoisie and right-wing anti-communist elements of the bourgeoisie and traitorous reactionary elements. In his own words, "He is a person with a mixture of feudal ideas and bourgeois ideas. ... From Tsinghua University to studying in Britain and the United States, he has always received bourgeois education. After returning to China, all his words and actions are the set of Anglo-American bourgeois ideas. Politically, he has always followed the third line." This is his own portrayal of his face.

As for Luo Longji's performance in daily life, such as playing with women everywhere, being greedy and selfish, hating working people, scolding cadres, pursuing a life of enjoyment, and insisting on the so-called American way of life, these also blatantly illustrate Luo Longji's exploitative class nature and decadent bourgeois ideology.

Due to this exploitative class nature and decadent bourgeois ideology, Luo Longji's consistent anti-communist and anti-socialist words and deeds; consistent pro-American and anti-Soviet criminal conspiracies, even under the Party and the People's Government's years of education and benevolent help, still remained intact, cleverly disguised, and waited for an opportunity to move. This time he took advantage of the loopholes in "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" and "Long-term coexistence, mutual supervision," and took advantage of the Party's rectification to form an alliance with Zhang Bojun, brazenly attacking the Party, and finally revealed his true colors in front of the people.

(II) Luo Longji's Consistent Anti-Communist and Anti-Socialist Words and Actions

Chu Anping, the mouthpiece of the Zhang-Luo alliance, attacked the Party and issued the notorious fallacy of "Party World." Although Luo Longji repeatedly quibbled, saying that Chu Anping's speech had not been discussed with him in advance, and he had not read it in advance, Luo Longji is an old "Party World" fallacy maker, with evidence and witnesses, which Luo Longji cannot deny. As early as 1930, Luo Longji had already published a similar anti-communist argument to Chu Anping in the "New Moon" magazine. Chu Anping's fallacy of "Party World" is a new version of Luo Longji's fallacy. Even if it is not inheriting Luo Longji's mantle, at least it has reached a tacit understanding with Luo Longji. Otherwise, how could Chu Anping be the mouthpiece of the Zhang-Luo alliance, and how could Chu Anping change the political direction of Guangming Daily? The so-called birds of a feather flock together, that is, what Luo Longji called "similar voices respond to each other, and similar spirits seek each other." The rightists of the China Democratic League naturally formed a gang under the banner of the Zhang-Luo alliance, and unscrupulously launched a frenzied attack on the Party and socialism.

Luo Longji's anti-communism and anti-socialism are historical. It goes without saying before liberation. Even after the national liberation in 1949 and the establishment of the People's Republic of China, Luo Longji participated in the People's Government, but he still had ideological resistance to accepting the leadership of the Communist Party. At the end of this year, the China Democratic League held the Fourth Plenary Session. Due to Luo Longji's conspiracy and collusion with Zhang Dongsun to compete for the leadership of the League, it caused internal disputes, and the League's problems were resolved after a long time. After the Fourth Plenary Session, Luo Longji continued to organize small groups within the League, co-opting rightists and harboring counter-revolutionaries. In the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Movements and the ideological reform movement, Luo Longji did not make a review, and the issues that should have been explained were never explained. After the issue of intellectuals was raised, Luo Longji recruited more troops, created public opinion, and blackmailed the Party and spread dissatisfaction. According to the exposure of Shao Ciyun and Pu Xixiu and others, Luo Longji opposed intellectuals and members of the China Democratic League from getting close to Party organizations and joining the Communist Party, disapproved of studying Marxism-Leninism and the necessity of ideological reform for intellectuals. Also, at this spring's work conference of the China Democratic League, Luo Longji used the pretext of the long-term nature of ideological reform of intellectuals and disapproved of ideological reform as the League's current central work. As for organizing four working groups, attempting to abolish the school Party committee system and proposing a series of conspiracies of bourgeois scientific planning, as well as suggesting to the CPPCC through the China Democratic League to set up a committee on the issue of intellectuals, and proposing to set up a rehabilitation committee at the United Front Work Department symposium, they were all deliberately denying the leadership of the Party, changing the direction of socialism, to restore capitalism, and make the Chinese people fall back into the hell of enslavement and darkness.

Luo Longji's anti-communist and anti-socialist words and deeds are consistent and historical, which can be fully proved from his class nature and the class education he received. But it is also necessary to give a merciless exposure and thorough criticism under his finely stitched, carefully crafted coat of covering up his faults. This is a serious, complex, and meticulous struggle. We must be tempered in this struggle, and use the specific and vivid facts in the process of the struggle to educate League members and old intellectuals, explaining how serious the harm of anti-Party and anti-socialist ideas is to the people and the cause of socialism, and also explaining how necessary and urgent the ideological reform of bourgeois ideas, that is, the ideas of intellectuals, is!

(III) Luo Longji's Consistent Criminal Activities of Being Pro-American and Anti-Soviet

According to Ma Yanxiang's exposure at the Shanghai group meeting of the National People's Congress, the famous saying of slavish admiration for the United States, "The American moon is bigger than China's," was originally announced by Luo Longji to the editorial staff of Yishibao in 1933 when he was the editor-in-chief. From Luo Longji's consistent collusion with American imperialism to carry out conspiracies, and often listening to "Voice of America," liking to read American magazines, praising American life, accepting American educational ideas, politically taking the American road, and at the same time being a "democratic individualist" appreciated by American imperialists... Judging from a series of facts, it is not surprising that he said this sentence at all.

First of all, let's use Luo Longji's own words to illustrate his pro-American activities. He confessed at the China Democratic League's rectification symposium: "During the old CPPCC era, I had a lot of contact with Stuart, Marshall, Wedemeyer, etc. I wanted the United States to help the third force. When Wedemeyer came to China to investigate, I also wrote a letter to him in the name of the China Democratic League, asking the United States to give money to help the Chinese third force. When I was in Shanghai, the American consulate invited me to dinner. Stuart once gave me medicine. The American consul in Hong Kong also came to see me in Shanghai." Of course, these words are still extremely dishonest, and he is still playing his so-called "skilled at using words to cover up mistakes, intelligent enough to disguise faults" trick. He did not say at all what transactions he had with American imperialism. According to the materials exposed, Luo Longji once said to Stuart that the United States had already bought the horse Chiang Kai-shek, who was bound to lose, why not take a fraction of the money to support the China Democratic League, which would be much more effective. How this horse-buying and horse-selling transaction was discussed, what the price was, what the effect was, and what the intentions of both parties were, Luo Longji remained silent and did not explain at all, but from his consistent pro-American and anti-Soviet conspiracies, it would not be an exaggeration to say that he was the trumpeter of American imperialists' aggression against China. For example, in 1946, Chiang Kai-shek and the United States signed the traitorous Sino-US Commercial Treaty. At that time, the people of the whole country opposed it, but Luo said that it was an equal treaty. When the people of Shanghai held a meeting to oppose the traitorous treaty, Luo got angry behind his back and said that the China Democratic League should not oppose it. In 1947, the China Democratic League held the Third Plenary Session in Hong Kong and made a resolution to oppose American imperialism, overthrow Chiang Kai-shek, and respond to the CCP's call to implement land reform and participate in the New Political Consultative Conference. However, Luo Longji did not accept this resolution, but still colluded with American imperialists, adhered to the middle line, and advocated peace talks, which was actually to cover up the reactionary regime and the American imperialists' aggressive forces in China. In 1949, the reactionary regime collapsed, the middle line went bankrupt, and Luo Longji attempted to change China's one-sided diplomatic policy. Later, knowing that this was our country's firm diplomatic policy, he could not do anything about it, but still very secretly carried out various pro-American and anti-Soviet conspiracies. For example, regarding the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, Luo Longji always believed in the distorted reports of American newspapers and periodicals, believing that the war was launched by North Korea. After the Geneva Conference, Luo Longji did not believe that the international situation had the possibility of tending towards easing. Especially after the 20th Congress of the CPSU and the Polish and Hungarian events, Luo Longji and Zhang Bojun reached an agreement in ideology, formed an alliance, spread pessimistic air, spread rumors that the socialist camp was not united but split, the international situation was not easing but tense, and the Hungarian event was the Soviet Union's interference in Hungary's internal affairs.

After the Suez Canal incident in Egypt, Luo Longji's American imperialist position and viewpoint, as well as his identity as a spokesman for American imperialists in China, became more obvious. He believed that the British and French aggression against Egypt was due to the pressure exerted by the United States, which caused Britain and France to stop the aggression, and the war did not escalate. He did not know that it was precisely because of the Egyptian people's resolute resistance and the Soviet Union's statement of opposition to aggression, and the sympathy and support of the people of the Soviet Union and China for the Egyptian people, that the British and French aggressors were completely defeated. In addition, Luo Longji also trumpeted for the United States, believing that the United States had power and skillful methods, and the international public opinion's evaluation of American imperialism was getting higher and higher, and the evaluation of socialist countries was getting lower and lower. This shows that his position of recognizing the thief as his father is very firm. His pro-American and anti-Soviet conspiracies are also consistent and historical.

In the past five major movements, Luo Longji has muddled through. His pro-American, anti-Soviet, anti-communist, and anti-socialist thoughts and crimes have not been thoroughly exposed and criticized. This time, in the anti-rightist struggle, we must thoroughly investigate Luo Longji, who is the head of the rightists of the China Democratic League and the organizer of the Zhang-Luo alliance, so as not to cause further losses to the people's revolutionary cause and the socialist construction cause, and also to avoid the China Democratic League from suffering indelible stains. Relaxing and paralyzing the rightists is equivalent to slacking off the people's and socialist cause. This is a struggle to distinguish between right and wrong, and between good and evil. It is also a great struggle to uphold the truth and defend the socialist cause. Everyone must join this struggle, receive education, and be tempered. Therefore, we must ruthlessly expose and resolutely counterattack the rightist leader Luo Longji, and we will never stop until we win a complete victory!

    揭露民盟右派头子罗隆基的丑恶面目
    中国民主同盟中央常务委员　楚图南
    民盟右派头子罗隆基常自诩为“言足以饰非、智足以文过”，所以他的社会关系和政治生活中的肮脏历史，以及日常生活中的丑恶面目，一直蒙混和欺骗了大多数的人。因此他可以在各式各样的伪装和掩护下面，进行一系列的阴谋活动。但是，由于罗隆基利令智昏、得意忘形，他的阴谋活动和丑恶面目终于暴露出来了。他的一贯反党、反社会主义的言行和一贯亲美、反苏的活动，是有纲领、有计划、有组织的，是历史性的，因之也是更恶毒的。为了划清思想界限，和维护社会主义建设的伟大事业，全国人民有权从各方面来揭发他的丑恶面目和阴谋活动，也有权要求他向全国人民彻底交代和彻底坦白。
    （一）从罗隆基的家庭出身、教育和社会关系说起
    从罗隆基的家庭出身、社会关系和所受英美资产阶级教育来说，罗隆基的反共、反社会主义的思想、言论和行动，是有着很深的根子的。
    罗隆基出身于江西安福县枫田乡的地主家庭，他的哥哥恶霸地主罗慕增，解放前靠收租谷、剥削农民吃饭，并且依仗罗隆基的势力，到处敲诈勒索。罗隆基在土改时一直企图维护不法地主家庭，对农民的正义行动怀恨在心。据枫田乡车田农业合作社社员们的揭发，罗隆基曾指使他的哥哥罗兆瑞从北京写信到乡政府威胁说：“你们划罗慕增为地主并没收他的财产，是根据什么条文，限赶快答复。”社员们又揭露说，前年夏天，罗隆基回家时根本不问农民在党的领导下得到了什么好处，和别人谈话时总是别有用心地问搞合作化有甚么不好，统购统销有甚么不好，并且喜欢和地主、国民党员和他的“好亲戚”“老朋友”之类谈话。罗隆基表示对于合作化有意见，对于统购统销政策不满意，原来是在替这些人说话。所以他的阴谋活动，不仅在城市知识分子中间，并且也将触角一直伸展到农村中的坏分子中间，企图以此作为政治资本，讹诈撞骗，混淆是非和动摇人心。
    从罗隆基历史上的社会关系也可以看出他的反共、反社会主义是有历史根源的。他在美国留学时，把一些国家主义信仰者组织起来成立大江学会。归国后参加国社党，办“新月”，编益世报，并接受日本人的钱在天津办经济研究所。因此在1936年，他是不赞成全国团结抗日的。当时罗隆基曾发表文章宣布他的主张，亦即王克敏等卖国媚日的主张，即所谓华北特殊化的主张。他的理由是“日本既要求国民党撤出华北，何妨让我们各党各派干一下。”后来因为太平洋战争爆发，日德向英美宣战，亲美派的罗隆基，从这时候起才站到抗日方面来。这时，他进一步与美帝国主义者马歇尔、魏德迈、司徒雷登等人相勾结，希望美国扶植第三种势力，代替蒋介石，来奴役中国人民。所以和罗隆基有关系的主要是一些官僚资产阶级和资产阶级的右派反共分子和卖国反动分子。用他自己的话来说“他是一个封建思想和资产阶级思想混合起来的人。……从清华直到英美留学归来一直受的是资产阶级的教育。回国以后一切言论和行动都是英美资产阶级思想那一套。政治上一贯走的是第三条路线”。这便是他自己所勾画出来的自己的粉脸。
    至于罗隆基在日常生活上的表现，如人所熟知的到处玩弄女性，贪婪自私，仇恨劳动人民，辱骂干部，讲求生活享受，坚持所谓美国的生活方式，这些也露骨地说明了罗隆基剥削阶级的本质和腐朽堕落的资产阶级思想。
    由于这种剥削阶级的本质和腐朽堕落的资产阶级思想，所以罗隆基的一贯的反共、反社会主义的言行；一贯的亲美、反苏的罪恶阴谋，即使是在党和人民政府多年的教育和仁至义尽的帮助之下，仍然原封不动地保留下来，很巧妙地打掩护，待机而动。这次他钻了“百花齐放、百家争鸣”“长期共存、互相监督”的空子，趁着党整风的机会，与章伯钧结为联盟，猖狂放肆地向党进攻，终于在人民的面前露出了原形。
    （二）罗隆基一贯反共、反社会主义
    的言论和行动
    章罗联盟的喉舌储安平向党进攻，发出了臭名昭彰的“党天下”的谬论。虽罗隆基一再狡辩，说储安平的发言稿事先没有和他商量，他也事先没有看过，但罗隆基是老牌的“党天下”谬论的制造者，有赃有证，这是罗隆基所推脱不了的。远在1930年罗隆基在“新月”杂志，就已经发表了与储安平反共性质相同的论调。储安平“党天下”的谬论，正是罗隆基的谬论的新版。即使不是袭取罗隆基的衣钵，至少亦是与罗隆基有了默契。要不然储安平怎么能做章罗联盟的喉舌呢，储安平怎么能改变光明日报的政治方向呢？所谓物以类聚，也就是罗隆基所谓的“同声相应、同气相求”，民盟的右派分子自然而然的都在章、罗联盟的旗帜下结成一伙，并肆无忌惮地向党、向社会主义猖狂进攻了。
    罗隆基的反共、反社会主义是历史性的。解放前不用说了，即在1949年全国解放以后，中华人民共和国成立，大势所趋，罗隆基参加了人民政府，但是对于接受共产党的领导，思想上仍然有抵触。这一年的年底，民盟召开四中全会，由于罗隆基与张东荪阴谋勾结，争夺盟的领导权，造成盟内纠纷，盟的问题经久才得到解决。四中全会以后罗隆基仍然一直在盟内组织小集团，笼络右派分子和包庇反革命。在三反、五反运动和思想改造运动中，罗没有做过检讨，应该交代的问题也从没有交代。知识分子问题提出后，罗隆基更招兵买马，制造舆论，向党要挟并散布不满情绪。据邵慈云和浦熙修等人的揭发，罗隆基反对知识分子和民盟盟员靠拢党组织和加入共产党，不赞成学习马列主义和知识分子必须进行思想改造。又如在今春民盟的工作会议上，罗隆基借口知识分子的思想改造的长期性而不赞成以思想改造作为盟当前的中心工作。至于组织四个工作组，企图取消学校党委制和提出资产阶级的科学规划一系列的阴谋，以及通过民盟向政协建议设置知识分子问题委员会，在统战部座谈会上提出设立平反委员会等，更是处心积虑否认党的领导，改变社会主义的方向，要使资本主义复辟，使中国人民又重新堕落到奴役和黑暗的地狱里去。
    罗隆基的反共、反社会主义的言行是一贯的，是有历史性的，这从他的阶级本质和他所受的阶级教育中已经可以得到充分证明。但还须在他的细针密线、精心缝制的文过饰非的外衣下面，给予无情的揭露和彻底的批判。这是一场严肃而又复杂细致的斗争。我们必须在这一场斗争中接受锻炼，并以斗争过程中的具体而生动的事实，来教育盟员和旧知识分子，说明反党、反社会主义的思想对于人民、对于社会主义事业有着如何严重的危害性，也说明资产阶级思想，即知识分子的思想改造如何是必要的、迫切的！
    （三）罗隆基一贯亲美反苏的罪恶活动
    据马彦祥在人代大会上海小组会上揭发，原来“美国月亮比中国大”这句奴性的崇美、亲美的名言是1933年罗隆基主编益世报时，对报社编辑人员宣布的。从罗隆基一贯与美帝国主义勾结进行阴谋活动，并经常听“美国之音”，爱看美国杂志，赞美美国生活，接受美国的教育思想，政治上走美国的道路，同时自己就是美帝国主义者所赏识的“民主的个人主义者”……一系列的事实来看，他说这句话是一点不奇怪的。
    首先还是用罗隆基自己的话来说明他的亲美的活动。他在民盟整风座谈会上交代说：“在旧政协时代，我和司徒雷登、马歇尔、魏德迈等往来很多。我要美国帮助第三势力。魏德迈还来中国调查时，我又以民盟名义，写了一封信给他，要美国拿钱来帮助中国第三势力。我在上海时，美国领事馆请我吃过饭。司徒雷登曾送过药给我。香港美国领事来上海，也来看过我”。当然这话仍是极不老实，他仍在玩弄他的所谓“言足以饰非，智足以文过”的故技。他与美帝国主义的往来，做了甚么交易，他全没有说出来。据揭发出来的材料，罗隆基曾向司徒雷登说，美国已经买输定了的蒋介石这匹马，何如拿出几分之一的钱来支援民盟，作用会大得多。这买马卖马的交易，是如何谈的，代价如何，作用如何，双方意图如何，罗隆基虽然讳莫如深，没有丝毫的交代，但从他的前后一贯的亲美、反苏的阴谋活动看起来，说他是美帝国主义者侵略中国的吹鼓手，是不会过分的。譬如1946年蒋介石和美国签定卖国丧权的中美商约，当时全国人民反对，罗却说这是平等条约。上海人民开会反对卖国条约时，罗在背后大发脾气，说民盟不该反对。1947年民盟在香港召开三中全会作出决议，反对美帝国主义、打倒蒋介石，并响应中共号召实行土改，参加新政治协商会议。但罗隆基并没有接受这个决议，仍与美帝国主义者勾结，坚持中间路线并主张和谈，这实际上是为反动政权和美帝国主义在中国的侵略势力打掩护。1949年反动政权垮台，中间路线破产，罗隆基又企图改变中国一边倒的外交政策。后来知道这是我国坚定不移的外交政策，无计可施，但仍很隐蔽地作种种亲美、反苏的阴谋活动。如关于抗美援朝，罗隆基一直相信美国报刊颠倒事实的报导，认为战争是北朝鲜发动的。日内瓦会议以后，罗隆基也不相信国际形势有趋向和缓的可能。特别是苏共二十次代表大会和波匈事件以后，罗隆基与章伯钧思想上取得一致，结为联盟，散布悲观空气，传播社会主义阵营不是团结而是分裂，国际形势不是和缓而是紧张，匈牙利事件是苏联干涉匈牙利内政等等谰言。
    埃及苏伊士运河事件发生后，罗隆基的美帝国主义的立场、观点，以及作为美帝国主义者在中国的代言人的身份更明显了。他认为，英法侵略埃及，由于美国施加压力，致使英法停止侵略，战争才没有大打起来。而不知道这正是由于埃及人民的坚决抗战和苏联表明反对侵略的决心和苏、中两国人民对于埃及人民的同情和支持，才使英法侵略者遭到彻底地失败。此外，罗隆基又为美国鼓吹，并认为美国有力量、且手法高明、国际舆论对美帝国主义评价越来越高，对社会主义国家越来越低。这说明了他的认贼作父的立场是很坚定的。他的亲美反苏的阴谋活动也是一贯的，是历史性的。
    在过去的五大运动中，罗隆基都蒙混过关了，他的亲美、反苏、反共、反社会主义的思想和罪行，未受到彻底地揭发和批判，这次在反右派斗争中，对于作为民盟右派头子、作为章、罗联盟的组织者的罗隆基，我们绝不能不彻底追究，免使人民革命事业和社会主义建设事业再受到损失，也免使民主同盟遭受难以洗雪的污点。对右派分子的放松和麻痹，就是对人民对社会主义事业的怠工。这是明辨大是大非、大善大恶的斗争，也是维护真理、保卫社会主义事业的伟大斗争。任何人都必须投入这一斗争，接受教育和得到锻炼。因此，我们对于右派头子罗隆基，必须无情剥露，坚决反击，不获全胜，绝不收兵！
