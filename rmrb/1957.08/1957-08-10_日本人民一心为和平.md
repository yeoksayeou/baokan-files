The Japanese People are United for Peace
Pei Da

"I have become a 'guinea pig' under the American hydrogen bomb, and I hope such things will never happen again." These were the words of Japanese crew member Aikichi Kuboyama when he was dying in 1954. This sentence is infinitely painful for the Japanese people. In Japan, there are hundreds of thousands of innocent souls who died from the American atomic bombs, and tens of thousands of people are still suffering from "atomic disease," while the "ashes" of the Pacific hydrogen bomb test threaten the Japanese people. Old and new grievances have turned the Japanese people's grief and anger into strength, and they have launched a nationwide struggle to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs.

Before the Hiroshima atomic bomb victims memorial monument, people come in an endless stream to pray for peace. A Hiroshima resident, Setsu Miyatani (transliteration), who suffered from the atomic bomb disaster, is now sixty years old. He travels all over Japan alone, collecting 480,000 signatures demanding the prohibition of nuclear weapons. In order to build a "Group of Children Under the Atomic Bomb Disaster" statue in Hiroshima, students from primary and secondary schools across Japan have launched a campaign to raise funds for the statue nationwide. At the entrance of Kochi School in Kochi Prefecture, a "World Clock" decorated with the Earth and a dove of peace is hung, ringing the bell of world peace every day. This was cast by Kochi students with copper coins donated by students from eighty schools in twenty-two countries and copper coins they gathered themselves. Japanese Buddhist organizations collected the hair of 100,000 people to build a Buddha statue praying for peace.

Japanese women stand at the forefront of the peace movement. With great maternal love, they travel around calling out: "Protect our beloved children!" In October last year, the Standing Committee of the Japanese Mothers' Congress decided to send mothers' representatives to the United Nations General Assembly to petition for a ban on hydrogen bomb tests. To raise funds, they launched fundraising activities across the country. On city streets, in factories and mines, and in remote rural areas, mothers are fundraising. In front of Ikebukuro Train Station in Tokyo, passers-by stop in front of the "Fund Box" to sign and donate.

The Japanese mothers' representatives have completed their preparations for going abroad and are eager to meet with representatives of various countries at the United Nations. However, they have not been able to obtain visas from the US government, thus preventing this meaningful activity. The wife of Aikichi Kuboyama, who died under the American hydrogen bomb, was elected as a mother's representative. She expressed great indignation at this practice by the United States, saying: "I don't think the United Nations should be located in the United States where no one can enter. It should be located in a place where anyone can enter."

The US government cannot stop Japanese mothers' representatives from entering the United States, but it cannot stop the surge of the Japanese people's movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs. When news came out that Britain would test hydrogen bombs on Christmas Island and the United States would test them in Nevada, a wave of opposition to hydrogen bomb tests swept across Japan. From mid-February to May, resolutions against hydrogen bomb tests were passed in the councils of counties, cities, towns, and villages throughout Japan. On April 20, heavy rains fell across Japan, but national rallies against hydrogen bomb tests were held in sixteen places including Tokyo, Osaka, and Hiroshima, with more than 120,000 workers, farmers, citizens, and women representatives participating. Japanese students held rallies in sixty-three cities to oppose hydrogen bomb tests, with the participation of 170 universities, 400 student self-government associations, and a total of more than 350,000 students. This was the largest gathering in the history of the Japanese student movement. Four hundred and two Japanese physicists jointly issued an appeal calling for a stop to hydrogen bomb tests. More than 100 prominent Japanese physicists, including Hideki Yukawa, stated that they refused to participate in the testing and manufacturing of nuclear weapons. Empress Ryoko also expressed her desire to appeal to the world to stop hydrogen bomb tests at a meeting of the Japanese Red Cross.

In front of the British Embassy in Japan, there was a constant stream of demonstrations by workers, farmers, citizens, and students. Many people went on hunger strikes in front of the British and American embassies, demonstrating the strong will of the Japanese people to oppose hydrogen bomb tests. A pharmaceutical factory employee named Sato built a small house out of bamboo and sheet metal in front of the American Embassy on June 3. He lay there on a hunger strike, drinking only water and taking vitamin pills every day. He said: "I am here to draw the world's attention to the hydrogen and atomic bomb tests being conducted in the United States and elsewhere. I will stay as long as my body can support it." On May 15, in the central area of Nagasaki City, which was bombed by the American atomic bomb, fifty Japanese monks and nuns went on a hunger strike to demand a ban on nuclear weapons testing. They beat drums and chanted scriptures, praying for peace. After fasting for two days, they marched through Nagasaki City and collected signatures on the streets against nuclear weapons.

To welcome the Third World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament, 300,000 people in Japan participated in fundraising. The peaceful wishes of the Japanese people will be spread to every corner of the world through peace representatives from various countries, encouraging peace-loving people to carry out a resolute struggle to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs.

    日本人民一心为和平
    裴达
    “我已成为美国氢弹下的‘荷兰猪’，希望今后不再有这种事情发生。”这是1954年日本船员久保山爱吉临死时说的话。这句话对日本人民来说，是无限沉痛的。在日本有数十万被美国原子弹炸死的冤魂，还有几万人至今仍遭受着“原子病”的折磨，而太平洋氢弹试验的“死灰”又威胁着日本人民。旧恨新怨使日本人民化悲愤为力量，为禁止原子弹、氢弹展开了全民的斗争。
    在广岛原子弹牺牲者纪念碑之前，前往祈祷和平的人络绎不绝。一位遭受原子弹灾害的广岛居民牟小谷节（译音），今年六十岁了，他一个人在日本各地奔走，征集了四十八万人要求禁止核武器的签名。为在广岛建立“原子弹灾难下的群儿像”，日本各地中小学校的学生们在全国展开了募集建像基金的活动。在高知县高知学校的门口，挂起了一口装饰着地球和和平鸽的“世界钟”，天天发出了保卫世界和平的钟声。这是高知的学生用二十二个国家的八十所学校学生捐赠的铜币和他们自己聚集起来的铜币铸成的。日本佛教组织为建立一座祈祷和平的佛像，收集了十万人的头发。
    日本妇女站在和平运动的前列，她们怀着伟大的母爱到处奔走呼吁：“保卫可爱的孩子！”去年10月间，日本母亲大会常委会决定要派出母亲代表，为禁止氢弹试验到联合国大会去请愿。她们为筹措经费，在全国各地展开了募捐活动。在城市的街头，在工厂、矿山的工房里，在偏僻的农村，都有母亲们的募捐活动。在东京池袋火车站前，来往行人在“基金箱”前停下来，纷纷签名捐献。
    日本母亲代表的出国准备工作都作好了，她们迫不及待地要和联合国的各国代表见面，但是她们得不到美国政府的签证，因而这一有意义的活动就这样被阻止了。死在美国氢弹下的久保山爱吉的妻子被推选为母亲代表，她对美国的这种做法表示非常义愤，她说：“我认为联合国不应设在谁也不能进去的美国，它应该设在谁也可以进去的地方。”
    美国政府阻止日本母亲代表进入美国，但是它无法阻止日本人民要求禁止原子弹、氢弹运动的高涨。当英国要在圣诞岛和美国要在内华达州试验氢弹的消息传出后，日本各地就掀起了反对试验氢弹的浪潮。从2月中旬到5月间，在日本各县、市、镇、村的议会里，都作出了反对试验氢弹的决议。4月20日，日本各地普降暴雨，但在东京、大阪、广岛等十六个地方举行了反对试验氢弹的国民奋起大会，计有十二万多工人、农民、市民和妇女代表参加。日本学生为反对氢弹试验在六十三个城市举行集会，参加的有一百七十个大学，四百个学生自治会，学生总数超过三十五万人。这是日本学生运动史上最大的一次集会。日本四百零二名物理学家联名发表了要求停止氢弹试验的呼吁书。日本著名物理学家汤川秀树等一百多人，表示拒绝参与试验和制造核武器的工作。日本皇后良子夫人在日本红十字会会议上，也表示要向世界呼吁停止氢弹试验。
    在英国驻日大使馆门前，不断出现工人、农民、市民和学生的示威队伍。许多人在英、美大使馆门前绝食抗议，表现了日本人民反对氢弹试验的坚强意志。一个制药厂的职员佐藤，6月3日在美国大使馆门前用竹片和洋铁皮搭成小屋子，在那里他躺下绝食，天天光喝水和吃维他命丸。他说：“我在这里是要使全世界注意在美国和其他地方进行的氢弹和原子弹试验。我的身体能支持多久我就呆多久。”5月15日，在长崎市遭美国原子弹轰炸的中心地区，有五十个日本僧尼绝食要求禁止试验核武器。他们一面打鼓，一面念经，祈祷和平。他们绝食两天之后，在长崎市内游行，并且在街上征集反对核武器的签名。
    为迎接第三届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会，日本有三十万人参加了募集经费的工作。日本人民的和平心愿将通过各国和平代表传遍世界各个角落，鼓舞爱好和平的人们为禁止原子弹、氢弹进行坚决的斗争。（附图片）
