Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 21st. According to estimates from flood control departments, during the period from the end of this month to early September, the Songhua River basin from Zhaoyuan to Harbin will experience a major flood approaching or exceeding that of 1956. The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Committee have held emergency meetings in the past two days and made comprehensive deployments.

The meetings called on the people of the province to mobilize urgently, resolutely fight against wind and flood disasters, and protect the safety of industrial and agricultural production and the lives and property of urban and rural people.

In order to do a good job in flood control, the Provincial Flood Control Headquarters has prepared a large number of flood control materials such as grass bags, iron wires, wooden poles, and mats. Nearly 150,000 flood control troops have been working hard to repair the river embankments on the province's riverbanks in recent days.

In the past month, continuous rainfall has occurred in various parts of Heilongjiang Province, and the water levels of various rivers have generally risen. In the past two days, the Second Songhua River in Jilin Province has experienced floods, and the main stream of the Nen River has also exceeded the highest water level in 1956. The confluence of the two floods will seriously threaten the Songhua River. According to the weather forecast, most areas of Heilongjiang Province will experience strong winds and heavy rain in the next day or two.

　  松花江将出现特大洪水
    新华社哈尔滨21日电　据防汛部门的估计，在本月月底到9月上旬这段期间，松花江流域肇源到哈尔滨一带，将出现接近或超过1956年的特大洪水。中共黑龙江省委会、黑龙江省人民委员会，近两天来分别召开紧急会议，进行了全面部署。
    会议号召全省人民紧急动员起来，和风灾、水灾作坚决斗争，保卫工农业生产与城乡人民生命财产的安全。
    为了做好防汛工作，省防汛指挥部已准备了大批草袋、铁丝、木杆、席子等防汛物资。全省各江堤上连日来已有近十五万防汛大军在紧张抢修江堤。
    近一月来，黑龙江省各地连续降雨，各江河水普遍上涨。近两天来，吉林省的第二松花江已出现洪流，嫩江干流也超过了1956年的最高水位。两股洪流汇合将严重威胁松花江。据气象台预报，近一两天，黑龙江省大部地区将有疾风暴雨。
