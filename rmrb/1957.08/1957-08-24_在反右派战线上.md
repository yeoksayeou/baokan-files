　　On the Anti-Rightist Front

　　Overcoming Rightist Thinking and Relaxed Sentiments: Shaanxi Province Reports More Successes in the Anti-Rightist Struggle

    After promptly overcoming rightist thinking and relaxed sentiments, the various agencies and units at the provincial and municipal levels in Shaanxi Province have recently exposed a new batch of rightist elements.

    According to statistics, the number of units without any rightist elements has decreased from the original sixty-two to thirty-three. In the cultural and educational system, the various units originally only found thirty-two rightist elements, but now this number has increased to sixty-three. Units such as the Shaanxi Provincial Women's Federation, which had previously believed themselves to be free of rightist elements for the past two months, have now also discovered some. The Northwest Coal Bureau recently uncovered a reactionary small group. The backbone of this reactionary small group, Li Yang, claimed to have a "blood feud" with the Communist Party and attempted to establish another "party" based on his reactionary small group. He called himself the "General Secretary" of this "party" and even appointed many "ministers" and "secretaries-general."

    Jiangxi Agricultural Department Relentlessly Pursues, Wang Mingkai Forced to Surrender

    Under the relentless pursuit and factual exposure and rebuttal by the broad masses, rightist element Wang Mingkai of the Jiangxi Agricultural Department has begun to disarm and surrender.

    Wang Mingkai admitted that he viciously slandered the people's democratic dictatorship system, saying: "The people's democratic dictatorship is the exclusive domain of the Party, the product of the Mao family, the Liu family party."; "The leadership of the Communist Party is arrogant, dark, without democracy, without science, spreading like clouds and fog."; "The Communist Party is top-heavy and not qualified to govern the country."; "The leadership of the Kuomintang is virtuous and talented, while the leadership of the Communist Party is an amateur who does not understand the business." He slandered the Party's leadership over literary and news circles as being "the same as Qin Shi Huang's burning of books and burying of scholars alive."; and he defamed district and township cadres as being loafers who used to indulge in prostitution and gambling, saying, "How can the Communist Party use this scrap metal as thugs and bring peace to the world?" Wang Mingkai confessed that he hoped for the Kuomintang to return to the mainland and arrogantly said to others: "Where are the emperors in the pavilions now? See how long they (referring to the Party) can be rampant."

    Madly Attacking the Party's Cadre Policy, Wang Ying Fantasizes About Returning to Power

    Rightist element Wang Ying of the Guizhou Provincial Insurance Company launched a vicious attack on the Party's cadre policy. He regarded cadres who had been working for a longer time as "incompetent and ignorant," believing that "the cooks of the Jinggang Mountains uprising, based on their merits, can become bank presidents and managers, but in terms of their abilities, they can only continue to be cooks or messengers." As for young cadres, he said they were "lacking in virtue and talent," believing they were "wet behind the ears" and "had not read enough books and were not well-cultivated." He even slandered female cadres who became leaders as being "wives in charge of the seals." He suggested that personnel cadres should "understand fifty years before and fifty years after," and that only people "over the age of thirty" were qualified. He also openly clamored: All leading cadres found to have the problems of "three major isms" in the rectification movement "have violated criminal law and must be arrested and dealt with according to law, either controlled, imprisoned, or killed."

    Before liberation, this rightist element served as a puppet county magistrate. The reason why he launched such a frenzied attack on the Party's cadre policy was that he wanted to regain power.

　　在反右派战线上
　  克服了右倾思想和松劲情绪　陕西省反右派斗争又传捷报
    陕西省和西安市级各机关单位及时克服了右倾思想和松劲情绪后，最近又揭露出一批新的右派分子。
    据统计，目前没有右派分子的单位已由原来的六十二个减少到三十三个。文教系统各单位原来只查出三十二个右派分子，现在已增加到六十三个。两个月来一直认为没有右派分子的陕西省妇联等单位，现在也查出了一些右派分子。西北煤炭管理局最近还揭露出一个反动小集团。这个反动小集团的骨干分子李扬，他声称和共产党有“杀父之仇”，并企图以他的反动小集团为基础另外成立一个“党”，他自称为这个“党”的“总书记”，还封了不少“部长”和“秘书长”等官。
    江西农业厅猛打穷追　王名恺不得不缴械伏罪
    江西农业厅右派分子王名恺，在广大群众猛打穷追、据理据实揭发与驳斥之下，已开始缴械伏罪。
    王名恺承认他恶毒诬蔑人民民主专政制度是：“人民民主专政是党的独家天下，是毛氏天下、刘家党的产物。”；“共产党的领导是嚣张，黑暗，没有民主，没有科学，像云雾一般弥漫”；“共产党头重脚轻，不足以治国”；“国民党的领导有德有才，共产党的领导是不懂业务的外行。”他诬蔑党对文艺、新闻界的领导是“和秦始皇焚书坑儒一样”；并诽谤区乡干部是过去嫖赌逍遥的游民，说“共产党把这些破铜烂铁作为打手，岂能治平天下。”王名恺交代说，他盼望国民党返回大陆，并狂妄地对人说：“阁中帝王今何在，看他（指党）横行到几时”。
    疯狂攻击党的干部政策  王盈幻想重新“上台”
    贵州省保险公司右派分子王盈，对党的干部政策进行了恶毒的攻击。他把参加工作时间较长的干部看成是“不学无术”，认为“井岗山起义的炊事员，就其功劳，可以当行长、经理，但就其能力说，还只能是继续当炊事员或传达。”而青年干部呢？他说是“缺德少才”，认为他们“乳臭未干”，“读书不多，养气不足”。他更诬蔑妇女干部当了领导是作“掌印夫人”。他建议人事干部要“前懂五十年，后懂五十年”，要“三十岁以上”的人才配作。他还公然叫嚣：凡是在整风中发现有“三大主义”毛病的领导干部，均属“触犯刑律，都得逮捕法办，或管、或关、或杀”。
    解放前，这个右派分子当过伪县长，他所以对党的干部政策进行如此疯狂的攻击，原来是想重新“上台”。
