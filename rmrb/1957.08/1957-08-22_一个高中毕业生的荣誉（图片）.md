An Honor for a High School Graduate

　　Li Yinping, a member of the Communist Youth League, was a 1955 high school graduate from Xinlan Middle School in Lanxi County, Zhejiang Province. In the spring of 1956, she joined the First Agricultural Cooperative of Majian Township in Lanxi County, where she took on livestock work. For over a year, she has been diligent and assiduous in her work, and has become an excellent veterinarian. Among the more than 400 sows and meat pigs under her care, none have died or fallen ill from August of last year to the present. (Xinhua News Agency draft) Xu Yonghui photographed it.
    This is a corner of the pigsty and "sports ground," also a "disease-free field" for livestock created by Li Yinping.

    这是猪舍和“运动场”的一角，也是李银屏创造的家畜“无病场”。
