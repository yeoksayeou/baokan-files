　　Celebrating the 13th Anniversary of Romania's Liberation
　　Standing Committee Member of the National People's Congress
　　Chairman of the China Zhi Gong Party Chen Qiyou
    Thirteen years ago, on August 23, 1944, the brave Romanian people, encouraged by the Soviet army's victorious advance towards fascist Germany, carried out the plan formulated by Comrade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej to overthrow the reactionary Antonescu regime, arrested Antonescu, and organized the struggle to turn their guns against Hitler's Germany, thus beginning a further liberation movement. Subsequently, the Romanian people, with high confidence and initiative, overcame various difficulties and advanced towards the road of socialist revolution, finally achieving a great victory.
    In the thirteen years since liberation, Romania's construction has progressed rapidly. Romania has become an integral part of the forces defending world peace and socialism, which is the glory of the Romanian people. Like the Romanian people, we firmly believe that under the correct leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party and Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, the Romanian people will surely advance from victory to victory and achieve even more brilliant successes in socialist construction, improving people's lives, and safeguarding world peace.
    While celebrating Romania's National Day, I naturally recall the unforgettable scenes during the visit to Romania by the delegation of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China in late 1956 and early 1957, in which I participated. Although that visit lasted only ten days, I will never forget it, because I received the infinite warmth of the Romanian people as comrades, and I also learned a lot of valuable things.
    After our delegation of the National People's Congress arrived in Bucharest on December 22, 1956, we were warmly welcomed and cordially received by the Romanian government leaders and Romanian workers and peasants, which made us feel like we were carrying out our visit in our own home. During the visit, I personally saw the Romanian workers working day and night diligently for the socialist construction of their own country, while also striving to manufacture orders for our country in their respective positions. This high degree of internationalism deeply moved and encouraged me. In the Mao Zedong Machine Factory, which mainly produces petroleum and chemical industrial equipment, I saw a large number of high-pressure steam boilers and chassis manufactured for our country's thermal power plants; in the "May 1st" factory in Ploiesti, I saw many excellent products produced for our country's orders. This factory alone supplied thousands of drill bits to our country in October 1956, and many other products were also sold to our country in large quantities, which is obviously of great significance to our country's still young petroleum industry. Another example is the Telmann Tractor Factory, which not only sold a large number of its best product, the "K.P. 35" tractor, to our country, but also, under extremely tight work conditions, dispatched first-class technicians to our country to help with technical training. Through their enthusiastic assistance, many young farmers in our country have learned and mastered the technology of using tractors. During the visit, I also saw many of our country's industrial and agricultural products serving Romania's socialist construction and the cause of improving people's lives. This mutual support in materials and technology fully reflects the cooperative relationship and deep friendship between the governments and peoples of China and Romania, based on equality, mutual benefit, and mutual assistance. This friendly relationship is built on the common foundation of socialism and is as solid as a rock, permanent and everlasting.
    While visiting various factories and farms, we also visited many workers' and peasants' families, witnessed the improvement of the lives of the working masses, and their overflowing confidence and enthusiasm for socialism. On the one hand, they deeply recognize the glory of the arduous revolutionary struggle and the preciousness of the happy life earned by the people themselves with their blood and sweat, and therefore love their country; on the other hand, they express sincere gratitude and high internationalist friendship for the assistance provided by the Soviet Union to Romania's liberation. This situation is fully understood by the Chinese people. This internationalist friendship is very valuable, because the strong unity between our socialist countries not only helps the construction of each socialist country itself, but is also a strong guarantee for the security of socialist countries and a fundamental force for safeguarding world peace.
    The reason why our socialist countries are full of friendship and unity is because we have a common lofty belief in socialism and communism and a consistent demand for safeguarding world peace. At present, the construction undertakings of our socialist countries are advancing vigorously according to the specific characteristics of each country, and have achieved brilliant successes, because we have the correct leadership of the working-class parties in each country and the superiority of the socialist system itself that we adhere to. Iron facts prove this truth. Our unity, prosperity, and progress are, of course, what the imperialists and bourgeois elements least want to see and dare not admit. They try their best to slander our achievements and undermine our unity. But no matter how cunning they are, or how they can temporarily confuse some people, they are bound to fail in the end. Just as clouds and fog obscure the sun and moon, they can only temporarily play a one-sided role of covering, but when the wind dissipates and the clouds clear, the brilliance of the sun and moon will still shine on the earth.
    Recently, a small handful of right-wing political ambitionists emerged in our country. Taking advantage of the Chinese Communist Party's rectification campaign, they frantically attacked the Chinese Communist Party and China's socialist construction, opposed the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party in all aspects, opposed the socialist system, and attempted to restore the dark rule of the bourgeoisie in China. Now the Chinese people have launched a full counterattack against them, and their ugly faces have been exposed and their conspiracies have been smashed. In order to uphold the truth, adhere to the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, resolutely follow the socialist road, and accelerate socialist construction, we must continue to carry out the anti-rightist struggle in depth on the basis of the victories we have already achieved, and we will never stop until we have won a complete victory.
    Now, on the grand occasion of the 13th anniversary of Romania's liberation, I wholeheartedly cheer for the brilliant achievements of the Romanian people over the past thirteen years, and I wish the Romanian people even greater victories and achievements in the future under the correct leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party and its leader Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej.

　　庆祝罗马尼亚解放十三周年
　　全国人民代表大会常务委员
　　中国致公党主席　陈其尤
    十三年前，1944年8月23日，勇敢的罗马尼亚人民在苏联军队向法西斯德国胜利进军的鼓舞下，执行了乔治乌—德治同志所制定的推翻反动的安东尼斯库政权的计划，逮捕了安东尼斯库，并组织了将枪口转向希特勒德国的斗争，开始了进一步的解放运动。之后，罗马尼亚人民就以高度的信心和积极性，克服了种种困难，向社会主义革命的道路前进，终于取得了伟大胜利。
    解放十三年来，罗马尼亚的建设事业飞速前进。罗马尼亚已成为保卫世界和平和社会主义力量的组成部分，这是罗马尼亚人民的光荣。我们和罗马尼亚人民一样，坚信罗马尼亚人民在罗马尼亚工人党和格·乔治乌—德治的正确领导下，一定将从胜利走向胜利，在社会主义建设、提高人民生活和保卫世界和平的事业上取得更辉煌的成绩。
    在庆祝罗马尼亚国庆的时候，很自然地使我回忆起1956年末和1957年初参加我国全国人民代表大会常务委员会代表团在罗马尼亚访问期间令人难忘的情景。那次访问虽然为期只有十天，但是我永远不会忘记，因为我从这里得到了罗马尼亚人民给我的同志式的无限温情，也学习到了不少宝贵的东西。
    1956年12月22日，我们全国人民代表大会代表团到达了布加勒斯特以后，即受到了罗马尼亚政府领导人和罗马尼亚工农同志们的热烈欢迎和殷切接待，使我们像在自己家里一样进行着访问工作。访问期间，我亲眼看到了罗马尼亚的工人同志们在日夜辛劳地为自己国家的社会主义建设而努力的同时，还在各自的岗位上努力为我国制造订货，这种高度的国际主义精神使我深深地受到了感动和鼓舞。在主要生产石油工业和化学工业设备的毛泽东机器工厂里，就看到了该厂为我国火力发电厂制造的大量高压蒸气锅炉和车架；在普罗也什蒂“五一”工厂里，就看到了它为我国订货而生产的许多优良产品。该厂仅在1956年10月份里一次就供给了我国数以千计的钻头，其他各种产品售给我国的也为数甚多，这对我国还很年轻的石油工业显然是有着很重要的意义的。又如台尔曼拖拉机工厂，它不仅将其最优秀的产品“K．P．35式”拖拉机大量售给我国，同时还在工作极度紧张的情况下，抽调出第一流的技术人员来我国帮助技术训练。通过他们的热情帮助，使我国很多青年农民了解和学会了使用拖拉机的技术。在参观访问的期间，我也看到了很多我国的工农产品，在为罗马尼亚的社会主义建设和提高人民生活的事业服务。这种物质上和技术上的相互支援，充分体现了中罗两国政府和人民在平等互利基础上互相支援、互相帮助的合作关系和深厚的友谊，而这种友好关系是建立在社会主义的共同基础上的，是如磐石般牢不可破、永久长存的。
    在参观各种工厂和农场的同时，我们还访问了很多工人和农民的家庭，看到了工农大众生活的改善和他们洋溢着的对社会主义的无限信心和热情。一方面，他们从亲身经历的今昔对比里，深深地认识到艰苦的革命斗争的光荣和人民自己用血汗换来的幸福生活的可贵，因而热爱自己的国家；另一方面，对苏联对罗马尼亚的解放所作的援助表示真诚的感谢和高度国际主义的友爱。这种情形是中国人民所能完全了解的。这种国际主义的友情是非常可贵的，因为我们社会主义国家之间的坚强团结，不仅有助于各社会主义国家本身的建设，也是社会主义国家的安全的有力保障，是保卫世界和平的根本力量。
    我们社会主义各国之间所以充满着友好和团结，是因为我们有着共同对社会主义和共产主义的崇高信念和保卫世界和平的一致要求。目前，我们社会主义各国的建设事业都正根据各个国家的具体特点向前猛进，而且都获得了辉煌的成就，这是因为我们有着各自的工人阶级的政党的正确领导和我们所奉行的社会主义制度本身的优越性。铁的事实证明着这一真理。我们的团结、繁荣和进步，当然是帝国主义者和资产阶级分子所最不愿意看到也最不敢承认的。他们想尽各种办法来污蔑我们的成就，破坏我们的团结。但尽管他们诡计多端，或者可以暂时迷惑一部分人，但最后一定是要失败的。这正如云雾之于日月，只能暂时起片面的遮盖作用，但风消云散，日月的光华仍将普照大地。
    我国最近出现了一小撮右派政治野心分子，他们乘着中国共产党整风的机会向中国共产党和中国的社会主义建设猖狂进攻，从各方面反对中国共产党的领导，反对社会主义制度，企图在中国恢复资产阶级的黑暗统治。现在中国人民已向他们全力反击，他们的丑态原形毕露了，阴谋粉碎了。为了维护真理，坚持中国共产党的领导，坚决走社会主义道路，加速社会主义建设，我们还要在已获得的胜利的基础上继续将反右派斗争深入进行到底，不获全胜决不收兵。
    现当罗马尼亚解放十三周年的隆重纪念日，我衷心地为罗马尼亚人民十三年来的光辉成就而欢呼，预祝罗马尼亚人民在罗马尼亚工人党及其领袖乔治乌—德治的正确领导下，在今后获得更伟大的胜利和成就。
