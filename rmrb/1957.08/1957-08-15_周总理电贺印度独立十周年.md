Xinhua News Agency, August 14th: Premier Zhou Enlai today sent a telegram to the Prime Minister of the Republic of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, congratulating him on the tenth anniversary of Indian independence.

The telegram stated that the Chinese people are greatly pleased to see that, due to India's independence and the founding of the People’s Republic of China, the traditional friendship between the two great nations of China and India, which had been severed for a long time by colonialism, has been restored and further strengthened on the new basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. May this friendship between our two countries be increasingly consolidated and developed, so as to make greater contributions to safeguarding peace in Asia and the world, and may the Republic of India be prosperous and strong.
