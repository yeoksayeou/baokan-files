Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 17th - Twelve new writing systems are being promoted and piloted in eight ethnic minority areas of Yunnan.

After more than five years of investigation and research work in Yunnan, linguists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, specializing in minority languages, have helped the Dai, Jingpo, Lisu, Kawa, Hani, Lahu, Naxi, and Miao ethnic minorities to create and improve twelve writing systems. Among them, the new Dai scripts (Dai Le, Dai Na), for which finalized schemes have been determined, are being widely promoted and used in Dai areas such as the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture and the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture. To date, in the Dehong Dai area alone, there are sixty-eight Dai primary schools and a vast number of Dai people using the new Dai script for teaching and literacy campaigns. Announcements, notices, and newspapers issued by the local government are also using the new Dai script.

In the first half of this year, schemes (drafts) for ten ethnic minority scripts of seven ethnic groups—Lisu, Jingpo, Zaiwa (a type of Jingpo script), Kawa, Naxi, Hani, Bika (Mojiang Hani script), Lahu, and Miao (two dialectal scripts from western and northeastern Yunnan)—which have been discussed and approved in Yunnan, are being piloted in various ethnic areas. During the pilot phase, the Lancang Lahu Autonomous County has already opened a short-term teacher training course for 150 Lahu script instructors. After four months of study, the trainees have learned to write letters and keep records.

    为少数民族制定文字
    十二种新文字正在云南推广和试行
    新华社昆明17日电  十二种新文字正在云南八个少数民族地区推广和试行。
    中国科学院少数民族语文调查工作者在云南经过五年多的调查研究工作，帮助傣、景颇、傈僳、佧佤、哈尼、拉祜、纳西、苗等八个少数民族创造和改进了十二种文字，其中已确定方案的新傣文（傣仂、傣纳），正在西双版纳傣族自治州、德宏傣族景颇族自治州等傣族地区普遍推广使用。到目前为止仅德宏傣族地区就有六十八所傣族小学和广大傣族人民使用新傣文教学和扫除文盲，当地政府颁发的布告、通知和报刊等都使用了新傣文。
    在今年上半年，已在云南先后讨论通过的傈僳、景颇、载佤（景颇族的一种文字）、佧佤、纳西、哈尼、碧卡（墨江哈尼文）、拉祜、苗（滇西、滇东北的两种方言文字）等七个民族十种民族文字的方案（草案）都在各民族地区试行。在试行中澜沧拉祜族自治县已开办了一百五十多名拉祜文短期师资训练班，学员们经过了四个月的学习，已学会了写信和记录。
