Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 2nd: On August 1st, the Chinese youth delegation participating in the World Youth Festival invited the Japanese youth delegation to a meeting at the restaurant of the Soviet Agricultural Exhibition. At eleven o'clock in the morning, hundreds of people gathered in the restaurant, creating an exceptionally harmonious atmosphere.

	Xiang Nan, deputy head of the Chinese delegation, first welcomed the Japanese youth on behalf of all members of the delegation. He said that China and Japan have inseparable connections in culture, economy, history, and even geography. This connection can also be seen from the appearance. Their written characters and languages are so similar. He said that the friendly relations between China and Japan for thousands of years have only been interrupted in recent decades, which is not in line with the common aspirations of the youth of both countries. Our common aspiration is for peace and the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. Xiang Nan's speech was greeted with long applause from the Japanese youth.

	Sano, head of the Japanese delegation, also spoke. He thanked the Chinese delegation for the invitation on behalf of all Japanese representatives. He said that he shared Xiang Nan's feelings and was deeply moved by Xiang Nan's words. He said that Japanese youth love peace, and we are determined to fight for Sino-Japanese friendship. I visited Shanghai last year, and I deeply realized the importance of Sino-Japanese friendship. I am determined to fight for Sino-Japanese friendship to the end.

	Afterwards, the two delegations exchanged gifts. Among the gifts from the Japanese delegation was a banner with the words "Friendship is the Power of Peace." At the meeting, representatives from both countries performed music and acrobatics, and engaged in cordial conversations. Although they did not speak the same language, they could understand each other after writing it down. At the meeting, the youth of the two countries also held hands and sang the song "Tokyo-Beijing" together.

    友情深厚　愿望相同
    中日青年亲切会见
    新华社莫斯科2日电　8月1日，参加世界青年联欢节的中国青年代表团邀请日本青年代表团在苏联农业展览会餐厅里举行了会见。上午十一点钟，餐厅里数百人济济一堂，分外融洽。
    中国代表团副团长项南首先代表全体团员欢迎日本青年。他说，中、日两国不论在文化上、经济上、历史上甚至地理上，都有着不可分割的联系。这种联系从外表上也可看出。他们之间的文字和语言也是那样相近。他说，中、日两国间几千年来友好的关系，只是近几十年来才被中断，这是不符合我们两国青年的共同愿望的。我们的共同愿望是要和平，要恢复中、日邦交。项南的讲话受到了日本青年长久的鼓掌欢迎。
    日本代表团团长佐野也讲了话。他代表全体日本代表感谢中国代表团的邀请。他说，他同项南有同感，听到项南的话很受感动。他说，日本青年热爱和平，我们有决心为中日友好而奋斗。我去年曾去上海参观，我深深体会到中日友好的重要。我有决心为中日友好奋斗到底。
    接着，两国代表互相赠送了礼物。日本代表团的礼物中有一面写着“友好是和平的力量”的旗帜。会上两国代表都表演了音乐和杂技节目，并且进行了亲切的交谈。他们虽然语言不通，可是写成文字之后彼此都能看懂，在会上两国青年还拉着手合唱“东京—北京”的歌曲。
