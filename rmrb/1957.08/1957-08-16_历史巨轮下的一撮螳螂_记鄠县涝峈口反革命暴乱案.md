    A Praying Mantis Trying to Stop the Wheel of History
    – On the Counter-Revolutionary Riot Case in Laoluo Kou, Hu County
    Gao En
    On May 17th of this year, a counter-revolutionary armed riot occurred in the mountainous area bordering Hu County, Zhouzhi County, and Ningshan County in Shaanxi Province. After the incident, the People's Government took emergency measures and quickly suppressed this small group of bandits.
    However, Han Zhao'e, a major rightist element and vice governor of Shaanxi Province, made absurd statements, insisting that this "was not a counter-revolutionary case" and slandering the Communist Party as "making a fuss over a trifle."
    Was this a counter-revolutionary case? Was the People's Government "making a fuss over a trifle"? The facts can answer this.
    This riot was instigated by a counter-revolutionary organization called the "Chinese Righteous Savior Army." The ringleaders of this counter-revolutionary organization were Zhang Chunyou and Yang Gaoshan. Both of these guys were of soldier-bandit origin, consistently committing crimes and not engaging in honest work in the past. Starting in March of last year, Zhang Chunyou and others began to engage in counter-revolutionary activities in the Laoluo area of Hu County, colluding with counter-revolutionary elements and reactionary landlords. In February of this year, bandit leader Zhang Chunyou spread rumors that "Shandong is in chaos" and "we have people in Henan and Sichuan," deceiving a small number of restless elements into joining the counter-revolutionary organization. Shortly thereafter, Zhang Chunyou, Yang Gaoshan, Zhang Quanwa, Wang Zhichang and others went to other counties to expand their counter-revolutionary organization, but they failed.
    In early May, when the rightist elements were frantically attacking the Party, the bandit leaders Zhang Chunyou, Yang Gaoshan, and others decided to "riot" on May 17th.
    On the morning of May 17th, this group of counter-revolutionary bandits took advantage of the mountainous terrain of Laoluo, with its large gullies and poor transportation, blocked the entrances to the gullies, and threatened and forced passing pedestrians and farmers going up the mountain to work to join their counter-revolutionary riot. These pedestrians and farmers had no choice but to follow along. These bandits destroyed the township governments of Laoluo Township in Hu County and Yong'an Township in Zhouzhi County, both located in the mountains, and finally fled into Ganluo.
    As these bandits passed through villages, they forcibly demanded food from the peasants. When the peasants refused to give them food, they stole corn. These bandits also used words like "Better to go late than never, if you don't go, your whole family will be confiscated" to entice and intimidate young farmers into joining their counter-revolutionary riot.
    Through the People's Government's swift suppression and the cooperation of the local masses, this small group of bandits was quickly wiped out. Zhang Chunyou, Yang Gaoshan, and more than twenty other key figures and core members were all arrested and brought to justice; those who were coerced into joining, inspired by the government's lenient policy, surrendered themselves to the authorities one after another. Now, order in the mountainous area has returned to normal, and the peasants are actively engaged in production.
    Why would the rightist element Han Zhao'e think that such an obvious case of counter-revolutionary armed riot was "nothing serious" and "not a counter-revolutionary case"? And why did he think that the People's Government's resolute measures to quickly quell the situation in this counter-revolutionary case was "making a fuss over a trifle"? It is not difficult to find the answer from the facts above. The "program" put forward by these counter-revolutionary elements echoed the anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist nonsense of the rightist elements. The rightist elements said, "Cooperativization has been messed up" and "unified purchase and sales have been messed up," so the counter-revolutionary elements used force to disband agricultural cooperatives and "abolish the unified purchase and sales policy"; the rightist elements said they wanted to "overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party," and the counter-revolutionary elements immediately took action. Furthermore, from the perspective of time, the frantic destructive activities of the counter-revolutionary elements and the rampant attacks of the rightist elements against the Party, the people, and the socialist cause also echoed each other. It is not difficult to see why the rightist elements wanted to protect and sympathize with these counter-revolutionary elements, and why they tried so hard to mitigate the crimes of these counter-revolutionary elements; it turns out that these counter-revolutionary elements were helping them greatly!
    Zhang Chunyou and Yang Gaoshan certainly had no counter-revolutionary status in history, but they were of bad character, consistently hostile to labor and the socialist system. When everyone has to pass the socialist test, they will inevitably collude with all counter-revolutionary elements and hostile class elements who hate socialism and embark on the road of counter-revolution. This can be clearly seen from Zhang Chunyou's confession. He believed that joining an agricultural cooperative required labor and deprived him of his so-called "freedom," so he was dissatisfied with agricultural cooperativization; doing small business required little labor and could earn money, but it also required government approval, so he was also dissatisfied; he disliked the trouble of needing cloth tickets to buy cloth, oil tickets to buy oil, and grain tickets to buy grain, so he was also dissatisfied with unified purchase and sales. In short, he was dissatisfied with everything socialist, he believed that only by "organizing a group of people" to overthrow the People's Government and overthrow socialism could he "get promoted and make a fortune."
    The fact that this incident was quickly quelled powerfully demonstrates that the People's Government is extraordinarily consolidated. Although a small number of people with unclear understanding were temporarily deceived by counter-revolutionary elements at the beginning, when they recognized the true face of the counter-revolutionary elements, they immediately woke up and resolutely assisted the government in suppressing these bandits. This further refutes the nonsense of the rightist elements in certain universities in Xi'an that "the people's regime is not consolidated," and their fantasy of counter-revolutionaries "rising up in remote mountainous areas to achieve national restoration" will never be realized.

    历史巨轮下的一撮螳螂
    ——记鄠县涝峈口反革命暴乱案
    高恩
    今年5月17日，在陕西省鄠县、盩厔与宁陕等县接壤的山区，发生了一起反革命武装暴乱案件。事件发生以后，人民政府采取了紧急措施，很快地就把这一小撮匪徒扑灭了。
    但是，陕西省的一个主要右派分子副省长韩兆鹗，却在那里大发谬论，硬说这“不是什么反革命案子”，并且诬蔑共产党是“小题大做”。
    到底这是不是一个反革命案件？人民政府是不是“小题大做”呢？事实是可以回答的。
    这次暴乱案件是由一个叫做“中国人义救命军”的反革命组织搞起来的。这个反革命组织的头目是张春有和杨高山，这两个家伙都是兵痞出身，过去一贯为非作歹，不务正业。去年3月起，张春有等开始在鄠县涝峈一带，拉拢反革命分子、反动地主等进行反革命活动。今年2月，匪首张春有造谣说：“山东已经乱了”，“河南、四川也有我们的人”，诱骗少数不安分子也参加了反革命组织。这以后不久，张春有、杨高山、张全娃、王志长等又分别到外县活动，妄图扩大他们的反革命组织，没有得逞。
    5月初，当右派分子向党猖狂进攻的时候，匪首张春有、杨高山等就确定在5月17日“暴动”。
    5月17日早晨，这伙反革命匪徒，利用了涝峈山大沟深、交通不便的地形，堵住了沟口，并且威胁和强迫过路的行人和上山生产的农民参加他们的反革命暴动。这些行人和农民没有办法，只得跟着走。这些匪徒捣毁了山内的鄠县涝峈乡和盩厔县永安乡两个乡政府，最后窜入甘峈。
    这些匪徒路过村庄时，就向农民强行派饭，农民不给饭吃时，就抢吃包谷。这些匪徒还用“迟去不如早去，不去满门犯抄”的话，来诱骗、威吓青年农民参加他们的反革命暴乱。
   经过人民政府的迅速进剿，和当地群众的配合，很快地全部消灭了这一小撮匪徒。张春有、杨高山等二十多名首要分子和骨干分子，全部逮捕归案；胁从分子在政府的宽大政策感召下，纷纷投案自首。现在，山区秩序恢复了正常，农民积极地投入了生产。
    对这样明显的反革命武装暴乱案件，右派分子韩兆鹗为什么会认为是“没有什么了不起”，“不是什么反革命案子”呢？又为什么认为人民政府对这个反革命案件采取坚决措施，迅速平息事态，是“小题大做”呢？从上面的事实里是不难得出答案的。这些反革命分子所提出的“纲领”，是和右派分子反党、反人民、反社会主义的谰言此呼彼应的。右派分子说：“合作化搞糟了”，“统购统销搞糟了”，反革命分子就用强力解散农业社，“取销统购统销政策”；右派分子说要“推翻共产党的领导”，反革命分子立即行动起来。再从时间上来看，反革命分子疯狂的破坏活动与右派分子向党、向人民、向社会主义事业的猖狂进攻，也起了互相呼应的作用。这就不难看出，右派分子为什么要庇护和同情这些反革命分子，为什么要极力为这些反革命分子减轻罪责，原来是这些反革命分子帮了他们的大忙！
    张春有、杨高山，历史上确实没有什么反革命身份，但品质恶劣，一贯仇视劳动，仇视社会主义制度，当着每一个人都要过社会主义这一关的时候，他们就必然会同一切仇视社会主义的反革命分子、敌对阶级分子勾结起来，走上反革命的道路。从张春有的供词里可以明显地看出这一点。他认为加入农业社既要劳动，又没有他所谓的“自由”，所以就对农业合作化不满；做小生意既少劳动，又能赚钱，可是又要政府批准，因而也不满；嫌买布要布票，买油要油票，买粮要粮票麻烦，因之对统购统销也不满。总之他对社会主义的一切都不满，他认为只有“组织一把子人”，推翻人民政府，推翻社会主义，他才能够“升官发财”。
    这一事件迅速平息的事实，有力地说明了人民政府是异常巩固的。虽然开始有少数认识模糊的人一时受了反革命分子的欺骗，但当他们认清反革命分子真面目以后，立即清醒过来，坚决地协助政府剿灭这些匪徒。这就进一步驳斥了西安市某些大学里的右派分子认为“人民政权并不巩固”的谰言，他们希望反革命在“偏僻的山区搞起，达到全国复辟”的幻想，永远也不会实现的。
