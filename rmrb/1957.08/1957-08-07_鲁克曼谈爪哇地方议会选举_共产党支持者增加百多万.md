Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 6th: Indonesian Communist Party Deputy General Secretary Rukman said that the Indonesian Communist Party will be able to obtain more than six million votes in the regional council elections throughout Java Island. This situation shows that in less than two years since the last parliamentary election, the Indonesian Communist Party's supporters on Java Island have increased by more than one million people.

Rukman said that this is because the Indonesian Communist Party has implemented a policy of a national united front, truly safeguarding the interests of the people, and enhancing the position of the Republic of Indonesia.

Rukman made these remarks at a mass meeting in Subang, West Java, on August 4th. The West Java regional council elections will begin on August 10th. The Indonesian Communist Party has already obtained more than five million votes in the Central Java and East Java elections, and its vote share ranks first in major cities such as Surabaya, Semarang, Solo, and Madiun.

In the parliamentary elections that began in September 1955, the total number of votes obtained by the Indonesian Communist Party throughout the country was more than six million.

    鲁克曼谈爪哇地方议会选举
    共产党支持者增加百多万
    据新华社雅加达6日电　印度尼西亚共产党副总书记鲁克曼说，印度尼西亚共产党在爪哇全岛的地方议会选举中，将能获得六百多万票。这种情况表明，在上次国会选举以后不到两年中，印度尼西亚共产党在爪哇岛上的支持者已经增加了一百多万人。
    鲁克曼说，这是由于印度尼西亚共产党执行了民族统一战线、真正维护人民利益和提高印度尼西亚共和国地位的政策。
    鲁克曼是8月4日在西爪哇苏邦地方的群众大会上这样说的。西爪哇的地方议会选举将在8月10日开始举行。印度尼西亚共产党在中爪哇和东爪哇的选举中已经获得了五百多万票，在泗水、三宝垅、梭罗、茉莉芬等大中城市中得票都占第一位。
    在1955年9月开始举行的国会选举中，印度尼西亚共产党在全国各地得票的总数是六百多万票。
