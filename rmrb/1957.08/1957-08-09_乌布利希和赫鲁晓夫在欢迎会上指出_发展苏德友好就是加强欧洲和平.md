Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 8th: When the Soviet Communist Party and government delegation arrived in Berlin on August 7th, Berlin citizens held a grand welcome meeting at the train station square.

    Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, delivered a welcoming speech at the meeting. He said: The visit of the Soviet Party and government delegation is an invaluable aid and support to the German people in their struggle against the aggressive imperialism and militarism of West Germany.

    Ulbricht summarized the fraternal and selfless assistance that the Soviet people have given to the progressive forces of the German people since the victory of the October Socialist Revolution. He then said: "At this crucial moment when the German people are fighting to turn West German policy towards peace and social progress, your visit is of great significance. During the visit, you will see with your own eyes that the citizens of our republic are united around the National Front of Democratic Germany, under the leadership of their Marxist-Leninist party, are doing everything possible to make the German Democratic Republic—the bastion of European peace—stronger and more consolidated, and are carrying out the task of peacefully building a happy life. You will surely be convinced that the German working class and all peace-loving forces in our country will work together with the people of the Soviet Union and all socialist countries to eliminate the danger of imperialist war and ensure a future of peace and socialism. The historically significant resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union pointed out this direction for us."

    Nikita Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, delivered a reply speech at the meeting. He pointed out: "European peace and security depend on the relationship between the Soviet and German peoples. Therefore, the Soviet people highly value the efforts of the government of the German Democratic Republic and all progressive forces aimed at developing and consolidating Soviet-German friendship."

    Khrushchev said: Due to the policies of the government of the German Democratic Republic and the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, an increasing number of Germans have realized that the fate of their homeland and the fate of European peace depend on their active struggle against the revival of German militarism. In this struggle, the working people of the German Democratic Republic and all peace-loving forces in Germany are resolutely supported by all democratic forces.

    He pointed out that the unity of all peace-loving forces, the unbreakable unity of the countries of the socialist camp, and vigilance against imperialist conspiracies are the decisive factors for winning this extremely important struggle. He said: "We must unremittingly consolidate the unity of socialist countries. This unity is an inexhaustible source of strength for each of our countries and for the entire socialist camp."

    Khrushchev pointed out that the Soviet government is doing everything possible to establish friendly relations and mutual understanding between the Soviet and German peoples, and expressed regret that the West German ruling clique has not supported this policy. He pointed out that this attitude of the West German ruling clique is very dangerous not only for the Soviet and German peoples, but also for the cause of world peace.

    The speeches of Ulbricht and Khrushchev were repeatedly interrupted by stormy applause. Those present cheered "Friendship!" in Russian and German.

    乌布利希和赫鲁晓夫在欢迎会上指出
    发展苏德友好就是加强欧洲和平
    新华社柏林8日电　当苏联共产党和政府代表团8月7日到达柏林的时候，柏林市民在车站广场上举行了盛大的欢迎会。
    德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希在会上致欢迎词。他说：苏联党政代表团的访问是对德国人民在反对西德侵略性的帝国主义和军国主义的斗争中不可估价的援助和支持。
    乌布利希综述了十月社会主义革命胜利以后苏联人民对德国人民的进步力量所给予的兄弟般的无私援助。他接着说：“在德国人民为了使西德政策转向和平和社会进步而斗争的这一紧要的时刻，你们的访问有重大的意义。在访问期间你们将亲眼看到：我们共和国的公民一致团结在民主德国全国阵线的周围，在自己的马克思列宁主义的党的领导下，正在竭尽一切力量使德意志民主共和国——欧洲和平的堡垒——更加强大和巩固，正在执行和平建设幸福生活的任务。你们一定会相信：德国工人阶级和我国一切爱好和平的力量将同苏联和所有社会主义国家的人民共同努力消除帝国主义战争的危险，确保和平及社会主义的未来。苏联共产党第二十次代表大会具有历史意义的决议给我们指出了这个方向”。
    苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫在会上致答词。他指出：“欧洲和平和安全取决于苏、德两国人民的关系如何，因此，苏联人民对德意志民主共和国政府和一切进步力量旨在发展和巩固德苏友谊的努力给予很高的评价”。
    赫鲁晓夫说：由于德意志民主共和国政府和德国统一社会党的政策，日益众多的德国人已经觉悟到，他们祖国的命运和欧洲和平的命运决定于他们为反对复活德国军国主义而展开的积极斗争。在这个斗争中，德意志民主共和国的劳动人民和德国一切爱好和平的力量受到一切民主力量的坚决支持。
    他指出，一切爱好和平力量的团结，社会主义阵营各国牢不可破的团结和对帝国主义阴谋的警惕，是这场极其重要的斗争能获得胜利的决定性因素。他说：“我们必须不懈地巩固社会主义国家的团结。这种团结是我们中间的每一个国家的力量和整个社会主义阵营力量的无穷尽的源泉”。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，苏联政府尽一切努力建立苏联和德国人民之间的友好关系和互相谅解，对西德统治集团没有支持这种政策表示遗憾。他指出：西德统治集团这种态度不仅对苏、德两国人民，而且对世界和平事业，都有很大危险。
    乌布利希和赫鲁晓夫的讲话屡次被暴风雨般的掌声所打断。到会者以俄语和德语欢呼“友谊！”
