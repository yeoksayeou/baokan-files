Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou: Farmers in Henan Province are enthusiastically delivering summer public grain. According to preliminary statistics in late July, the province had already stored 94.4% of the expected target. Sixty-eight counties and cities have already completed or nearly completed the summer public grain collection and storage work. Areas that have not yet finished are now adding temporary grain collection points and actively organizing the storage of public grain.

This year, Henan Province's public grain is still levied according to the stable tax amount of 1956, and the local surcharge has been reduced from 20% in 1956 to 15%. In terms of disaster reduction and exemption, the policy of legal reduction and exemption and social care is implemented. For grain-deficient cooperatives (households), the summer public grain should be converted into cash, and those who have difficulties in paying the cash can postpone the collection to the autumn. This takes into account the practical difficulties of the masses in the disaster areas in terms of production and life. Under the education and care of the Party and the government, farmers in various places have launched a wave of paying patriotic public grain to support national industrial construction, support compatriots in disaster areas, and counter right-wing elements.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, August 3: Shanxi Province paid attention to conducting political and ideological education for farmers during the summer grain unified purchase, and now farmers are enthusiastically selling grain to the state.

Shanxi Province had a poor wheat harvest, with total output decreasing by more than 400 million catties compared to last year. The state has reduced the unified purchase task in various places based on this situation. However, at the beginning of the unified purchase, many farmers wanted the state to buy less, and some agricultural cooperatives satisfied the food retention of their members before selling to the state, which affected the completion of the summer grain unified purchase task. In response to this situation, various places used various forms to explain the principle of "the state first, then the collective, and then the members" to the farmers.

The Jinan area also organized farmers and grassroots cadres to discuss the issue of unified purchase and sales of grain through various meetings, which had a good effect. In this area, 25 counties including Hejin and Linyi completed half of the unified purchase task within five days. After discussing the issue of whether the grain retention standard was low and who was supporting whom, the members of the Five-Star Agricultural Cooperative in Xiangfen County improved their political and ideological awareness, and finally decided that the whole cooperative would sell tens of thousands of catties in addition to handing in 100,600 catties of public grain. After discussion, eight townships, including Yaotou and Ruicun in Yuanqu County, completed the unified purchase task in less than three days.

Due to the in-depth development of ideological education, the progress of unified purchase and storage in the province was half a month ahead of last year.

    认清了支持社会主义建设的道理
    河南、山西农民踊跃卖粮食给国家
    据新华社郑州电　河南省农民踊跃交纳夏季公粮。据7月下旬初步统计，全省已入库公粮达到了预计完成任务的94.4％。有六十八个县、市的夏季公粮征收、入库工作已经结束或基本结束。现在未结束地区正增设临时收粮点，积极组织公粮入库。
    今年河南省的公粮仍然按1956年应征税额稳定不变的办法征收，地方附加由1956年的20％降低为15％。在灾情减免上，贯彻执行依法减免和社会照顾的政策。对缺粮社（户）夏季应交公粮折交代金，交代金也有困难的可以缓期到秋季征收。这样就照顾了灾区群众在生产和生活上的实际困难。在受到党和政府的教育、关怀下，各地农民为支援国家工业建设，支援灾区同胞，反击右派分子，纷纷掀起了交纳爱国公粮的热潮。
    新华社太原3日电　山西省在夏粮统购期间注意向农民进行政治思想教育，现在农民们踊跃卖粮给国家。
    山西省小麦歉收，总产量约比去年减少四亿多斤。国家已根据这一情况，核减了各地统购任务。但统购开始时，有不少农民还要国家少购，有的农业社先满足社员留粮然后再出售给国家，影响了夏粮统购任务的完成。针对这一情况，各地利用多种多样的形式，向农民解释“先国家后集体，而后社员”的原则。
    晋南地区还通过各种会议组织农民和基层干部讨论粮食统购统销问题，效果很好。这一地区的河津、临猗等二十五个县，五天内就完成统购任务的一半。襄汾县五星农业社社员，在讨论了留粮标准低不低和谁支援谁的问题后，社员政治思想觉悟提高了，最后确定了全社除交公粮十万零六千斤外，再卖出数万斤。垣曲县窑头、芮村等八个乡，经过讨论后，不到三天就全部完成统购任务。
    由于思想教育工作的深入开展，全省统购入库的进度比去年提前了半个月。
