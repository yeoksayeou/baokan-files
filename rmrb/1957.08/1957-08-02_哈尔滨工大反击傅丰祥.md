    Harbin Institute of Technology students are organizing a larger force to counterattack the rightist element, Fu Fengxiang, a third-year student.
    Two months ago, Fu Fengxiang posted a letter from his younger brother introducing the situation of Peking University rightists attacking the Party, and copied and posted Ge Peiqi's reactionary arguments overnight, adding annotations such as "Release thoroughly, criticize happily" and "Communist Party leaders, clear your heads." He also supported another rightist, Wang Xinsheng, and offered advice to another rightist, Kang Yongshan, telling Kang Yongshan to change the planned "Speak Bitterness Conference" into a "Rehabilitation Conference." After the People's Daily editorial "What Is This For?" was published, he also said: "The Communist Party is afraid of hitting the nail on the head," and "The suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement is a movement of spiritual violence."
    Fu Fengxiang's reactionary remarks aroused great anger among the students. People launched a large-scale rational struggle with him at the debate meeting. At this time, Fu Fengxiang put a label on himself, trying to desert under the guise of this label. When he couldn't get away with it, he slammed the table and threatened to return to his hometown. The students exposed these tricks of his and are organizing a larger force to counterattack him.

    哈尔滨工大反击傅丰祥
    哈尔滨工业大学学生正在组织更大的力量，反击右派分子、三年级学生傅丰祥。
    两个月前，傅丰祥贴出了他弟弟介绍北京大学右派分子向党进攻情况的北大来信，并连夜把葛佩琦的反动论点抄贴出来，还加上“放的彻底，鸣的痛快”、“共产党领导者们，清醒清醒你们的头脑”的按语。他还支持另一个右派分子王欣生，又向一右派分子康永山献计，叫康永山把准备召开的“诉苦大会”，改为“平反大会”。人民日报的“这是为什么”社论发表之后，他还说：“共产党怕击中要害”，“肃反运动是精神暴力运动”。
    傅丰祥的反动言论，激起了同学们的极大愤怒。人们在辩论大会上，同他展开了声势浩大的说理斗争。这时，傅丰祥给自己扣上一个帽子，想在帽子下面开小差。混不过去时，他就拍桌子，以回老家来要挟。同学们揭穿了他的这些花招，正在组织更大的力量反击他。
