Xinhua News Agency, August 3rd, Washington dispatch: The U.S. House of Representatives Military Committee passed an amendment on August 1st by a vote of thirty-one to four, restricting the government from transferring U.S. military personnel who commit crimes in foreign countries to the courts of the host country for trial.

The new bill would authorize the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force to make the final judgment as to whether a U.S. serviceman stationed overseas committed a crime while on duty and to determine whether the U.S. government has preliminary jurisdiction in all cases involving U.S. military personnel accused of crimes abroad. As long as he believes that the United States has preliminary jurisdiction over it, the government cannot hand over the offender to a foreign court unless there are "special circumstances" that lead the Minister to believe that sympathy can be shown to the host country's request.

This bill would undermine the "Status of Forces" agreements currently concluded by the United States with its allies. Under the current agreements, U.S. military personnel accused of committing crimes while off duty or not performing their duties are to be handed over to the judicial authorities of the country in which they are stationed for trial.

Government spokesmen said that the bill would undermine the intent of the Status of Forces agreements, if not the letter of the agreements.

The bill was triggered by the Girard case. Under pressure from Japanese and world public opinion not long ago, the U.S. government and the Supreme Court decided to hand over Girard, who shot and killed a Japanese woman, to Japan for trial. However, many members of the U.S. Congress have been expressing opposition to this decision.

    美国变本加厉庇护驻外军犯
    众院通过剥夺外国审判权的法案
    新华社3日讯　华盛顿消息：美国众议院军事委员会8月1日以三十一票对四票通过一条修正案，限制政府把在外国犯罪的美国军人移交驻在国法庭审讯。
    这项新法案将授权美国陆、海、空军三部的部长来最后判断一个在海外服役的美国军人是否在执行任务的时候犯了罪，并且由他们在一切涉及到在国外被控告犯罪的美国军人的案件的时候，判断美国政府是否对这件案子有初步管辖权。只要他认为美国对它有初步管辖权，政府就不能把犯罪者交给外国法庭，除非有“特殊的情况”，而使那位部长认为可以对驻在国的要求表示同情。
    这项法案将使美国目前同它的盟国缔结的“部队地位”协定遭到破坏，根据目前的协定，被控告在不值班的时候或是在不执行任务的时候犯了罪的美国军人都要移交给他们驻在的国家的司法当局审讯。
    政府发言人说，这个法案将破坏部队地位协定的意向，如果不破坏这个协定的文字的话。
    这个法案是由哲腊德案件引起的。美国政府和最高法院不久以前在日本和世界舆论压力之下，决定把枪杀日本妇女的哲腊德交给日本审讯。但是美国的许多议员却一直在对这个决定表示反对。
