　　This newspaper reports that Cao Renyuan, a professor in the Chemical Engineering Department of Beijing Institute of Technology and a key member of the anti-Communist and anti-socialist clique of rightist ringleader Chen Mingshu, has been exposed and criticized by teachers and students of Beijing Institute of Technology.

　　Cao Renyuan launched extremely vicious attacks against the Party and socialism. He said that socialism had no "rule of law" and no "morality." He also believed that the current concepts of right and wrong were no different from those of the old society, except that now "a word can bring life, and a word can bring death." He slandered the Party for "extinguishing ancestors and humanity" and slandered all the Party's work as "completely violating history," while also scolding activists as "good followers."

　　Cao Renyuan defamed the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the land reform, and the purge campaigns, deliberately portraying the Party and socialism as completely dark. He believed that counter-revolutionaries were forced out, saying that "good people can also become bad people."

　　Cao Renyuan tried every means to slander ideological remolding and teaching reform. He believed that teaching reform treated teachers "like kicking a football, kicking them around, and after kicking, the field is all empty." He also said that teaching now was "labor reform."

　　Cao Renyuan slandered the state monopoly of purchase and marketing and agricultural collectivization, saying "farmers can't get enough to eat," and even opened his eyes and said with ulterior motives, "I, this university professor, can't get enough to eat either." He believed that the increase in eggs on the market was because after agricultural collectivization, "farmers didn't harvest crops properly, scattering grain all over the ground, so the chickens had grain to eat."

　　Cao Renyuan came from a bureaucrat-landlord family and wanted to be an official and ride on the heads of the people since he was a child. He was the head of the Sichuan Gelaohui and had close ties with the counter-revolutionary element Leng Kaitai (who has been suppressed). He was the secretary of the Western Hills Conference and later served as the mayor of the puppet Zigong city. In 1947, he ran for the puppet National Assembly representative and puppet legislator.

　　Cao Renyuan had close contact with Chen Mingshu. Cao Renyuan provided a lot of material for Chen Mingshu's 50,000-word letter attacking the Party, and he also proofread this "50,000-word letter" at the end. He agreed to meet with Huang Jusu, Chen Mingshu's capable general, at least once or twice a week. Two hours before the teacher symposium held by the Party Committee of Beijing Institute of Technology, Cao Renyuan went to Huang Jusu's house to discuss how to attack at the meeting. Chen Mingshu specifically "visited" his home several times. He participated in the secret meetings held at Chen Mingshu's home and had close contact with Hu Lanqi, a rightist element in the school and a minion of Chen Mingshu.

    过去是四川哥老会的把头
    今天是陈铭枢集团的骨干
    曹任远右派面目被揭穿
    本报讯　北京工业学院化工系教授曹任远，是右派头子陈铭枢反共反社会主义集团的骨干分子，北京工业学院师生对他进行了揭露和批判。
    曹任远向党向社会主义进行了极其恶毒的攻击。他说，社会主义没有“法制”，社会主义没有“道德”。他还认为现在的是非概念和旧社会没有区别，所不同的现在是“一句话可以置人于生，一句话可以置人于死”。他污蔑党“灭绝祖先和人性”，又污蔑党的一切工作“完全违反历史”，还谩骂积极分子是“善于追随者”。
    曹任远诋毁镇反、土地改革和肃反运动，故意把党和社会主义说成漆黑一团。他认为反革命分子是逼出来的，说“好人也会变成坏人”。
    曹任远想尽一切办法诋毁思想改造、教学改革。他认为教学改革把教师“好像踢足球，踢来踢去，踢完了球场全是空的”。他还说，现在教书是“劳动改造”。
    曹任远污蔑统购统销和农业合作化，他说“农民吃不饱”，还睁着眼睛别有用心地说，“我这位大学教授也吃不饱”。他认为市场上的鸡蛋多了，是农业合作化以后，“农民不好好收割庄稼，撒了满地粮食，鸡才有粮食吃了”的缘故。
    曹任远出身于官僚地主家庭，从小就想当官骑在人民头上。他是四川哥老会的把头，又和反革命分子冷开泰（已镇压）有密切联系。他是西山会议的秘书，后来担任过伪自贡市长。1947年，他曾竞选伪国大代表和伪立法委员。
    曹任远与陈铭枢有密切往来，陈铭枢向党进攻的五万言书中，曹任远提供了不少材料，还最后校审这“五万言书”。他同陈铭枢的得力大将黄居素，约定每周至少见面一两次。曹任远在北京工业学院党委举行的教师座谈会前的两个小时，还跑到黄居素家里去商谈在会上如何进攻。陈铭枢曾数次特意到他家“拜访”，他参加了在陈铭枢家里召开的历次秘密会议，还和学校里的右派分子、陈铭枢的小喽啰胡兰畦有密切联系。
