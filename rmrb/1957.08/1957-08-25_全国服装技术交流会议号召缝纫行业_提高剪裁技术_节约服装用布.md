Xinhua News Agency, August 24th: The Handicraft Bureau convened a National Garment Technology Exchange Conference from August 12th to 24th. The conference called on workers in the national garment industry to improve their tailoring skills and vigorously launch a campaign to save fabric.

The conference reflected the opinions of representatives from various regions that the potential for saving fabric in the sewing industry is still significant. According to repeated calculations by the representatives, the amount of fabric used for a typical men's uniform could be reduced from 16 feet to 13 feet 9.5 inches, and the amount of fabric used for a women's garment could be reduced from 15 feet to 13 feet 6 inches. It is also possible to save one foot of fabric per set of cotton-padded clothing. There is also great potential for saving fabric in other types of clothing.

The conference requested that leading handicraft departments at all levels strengthen ideological education for sewing industry workers. Regions with the necessary conditions can hold technical exchange meetings, short-term training courses, exhibitions, etc., to improve the technical level of the majority of workers.

The conference believes that garment companies and commercial departments in various regions can establish technical research offices to specialize in studying garment specifications, quality standards, operating procedures, and garment styles.

　　全国服装技术交流会议号召缝纫行业
　　提高剪裁技术　节约服装用布
    据新华社24日讯　8月12日至24日手工业管理局召开了全国服装技术交流会议，会议号召全国服装行业职工提高剪裁技术水平，大力开展节约服装用布运动。
    会议根据各地代表反映，目前缝纫行业节约服装用布的潜力还很大，据代表们反复计算，一般的男制服可以由过去一身服装用布十六尺减少到十三尺九寸五分，女服装也可以由一身服装用布十五尺减少到十三尺六寸。棉衣每套节约一尺布也是可能的。其他服装节约用布潜力也大。
    会议要求各级手工业领导部门加强对缝纫行业职工的思想教育，有条件的地区可以举办技术交流会、短期训练班、展览会等，提高广大职工的技术水平。
    会议认为，各地的服装公司、商业部门可以成立技术研究室，专门研究服装的规格、质量标准和操作规程以及服装式样等。
