　　I. Asia is one family, this friendship is better than close neighbors; Moreover, we share the same heart and the same art, and the cloud carriages travel thousands of miles to show true feelings.
　　II. Countries are equal regardless of size, and faces are yellow and black but the images are no different. May I ask the colonialists of the former dynasty, can they still despise Asia?
　　III. Filmmakers bring friendship, and exotic flowers bloom here: Every film has a high standard of national feeling, and excellent varieties are seen outside of hundreds of flowers.
　　IV. The sound of war drums has ceased, and guests travel far and wide. The Asian film exhibition is not alone in its virtue. Nine cups of wine and joyful dances open the silver screen, and the capital is filled with cheers from the masses.

　　亚洲电影周迎各国代表团于北京
    孙师毅
　　一一洲本是一家亲，此谊原来胜睦邻；况复同心同一艺，云车万里见情真。
　　二国无大小人平等，面有黄黔影不殊。试问前朝殖民者，还能轻视亚洲无？
　　三影人带得友情来，异域奇葩此地开：片片高标民族感，百花之外见名栽。
　　四桴鼓销声客载途，亚洲影展德非孤。九觞酣舞开银幕，万众欢呼会首都。
