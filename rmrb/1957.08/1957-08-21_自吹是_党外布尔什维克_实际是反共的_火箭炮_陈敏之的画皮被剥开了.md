　　Flaunting Himself as a "Non-Party Bolshevik," In Reality He Was an Anti-Communist "Rocket Launcher":
　　Chen Minzhi's Mask Has Been Torn Off
　　(Our Newspaper's dispatch) Why was the anti-rightist struggle of the China Democratic League organizations in Jiangsu Province and Nanjing Municipality not launched for nearly two months? The "mystery" has recently been revealed. It turned out that Chen Minzhi, the chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee and Nanjing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, who called himself a "non-Party Bolshevik" and once controlled the leadership of the anti-rightist struggle within the League, was a rightist backbone element disguised as a leftist, and a "rocket launcher" of the Zhang-Luo clique in Jiangsu and Nanjing. It was not until August 11, when the progressive forces within the League reorganized the rectification committee, took the leadership of the anti-rightist struggle from Chen Minzhi, and held several meetings in succession, that this rightist element in disguise quickly revealed his true colors. His accomplices, such as Fan Guang, the vice chairman of the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League and a rightist element, are also being surrounded by the masses.
　　According to recent exposures, Chen Minzhi was originally a veteran double-dealer, who had always deceived the Communist Party and hoodwinked the masses with a progressive face. Within the China Democratic League, he served as a member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, chairman of Jiangsu and Nanjing Municipal Committees, and in Jiangsu, he also served as a provincial people's representative and deputy secretary-general of the provincial people's committee. In all public occasions, Chen Minzhi professed to support the Communist Party, touting himself as "always being with the Party," "I will shout whatever the Party says," and "Without the Party, there would be no League, and the League has no secrets from the Party," dressing himself up as a complete "leftist," while in fact, he was honey-mouthed and dagger-hearted towards the Communist Party, and resolutely attacked the Party. This year, at the League Central's April meeting, Chen Minzhi served as the convener of the group, defended the thirty suggestions of the Zhang-Luo clique's anti-communist and anti-socialist conspiracy at the meeting, and was very active. Zhang Bojun personally invited him to dinner and talked with him about the "bicameral system" and other issues. Pan Guangdan, a general of the Luo Longji clique, also secretly talked in Chen's room. However, after he returned to Nanjing, he told the responsible comrades of the CCP provincial and municipal committees that he had "long heard about the unhealthy trends of the League Central, and this meeting was abnormal."
　　The day after Chen Minzhi returned to Nanjing, he hurriedly made a long-distance call to summon the heads of the China Democratic League from various places to Nanjing, and together with the League members in Nanjing, held a three-day meeting. At the meeting, he distorted the content of Chairman Mao's report at the Supreme State Conference, and vigorously instilled the reactionary remarks of the Zhang-Luo clique into the League members, saying that "the China Democratic League used to carry the flag and hold the umbrella, but in the future it should think independently," and said that he used to be "not tough enough, and dared not say half a sentence in the presence of Party leaders, which made the masses look at him like a little wimp." He incited everyone to "only talk about shortcomings, not about achievements," "not be afraid of being one-sided," and "not be afraid of being incorrect" during the airing of views. Many League members called this meeting Chen Minzhi's "ignition meeting," which was deeply poisoned. Recently, Chen Minzhi was forced to admit that this meeting "firstly trafficked in toxins; secondly, sowed the seeds of fire; and thirdly, delivered orders."
　　After that, under the planning of Chen Minzhi and Fan Guang, the Jiangsu Provincial Committee and Nanjing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League took advantage of the airing of views to attack the Party, which was extremely active. On April 18, Chen Minzhi made vicious attacks on the Party in the notice issued to various grassroots organizations, in the joint symposium of the Jiu San Society members in the Jiangsu Provincial People's Congress, and in the Nanjing symposium of the nine major cities symposium convened by Guangming Daily. At the Guangming Daily symposium, he said that the relationship between Party and non-Party members, Party members and veteran teachers in colleges and universities was "uncoordinated," "even tense," and "the crux of the problem is the system." As soon as the Provincial People's Congress closed, he convened a cadre meeting to arrange a month-long symposium, allowing each of the 600 League members in Nanjing to speak once. At the same time, they also jointly planned symposiums on the school system, the system, and political science and law, igniting fire everywhere and collecting "bullets" to attack the Party. On May 17, he personally made a report to the League members of the East China Agricultural Science Research Institute, inciting everyone to "go straight to the point." After May 20, Chen Minzhi and Fan Guang jointly convened three meetings of middle school grassroots League members, igniting fire in middle schools in Nanjing. On May 25, the rectification steps of the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China were issued, determining that middle schools would not be rectified for the time being. Chen Minzhi openly resisted, saying to the cadres of the United Front Work Department: "You have been passive, and you have made us passive again," "We firmly disagree with the transfer," "The masses have already risen, and the fire has already been lit," "Even if there is great democracy, it doesn't matter." On June 3, Chen Minzhi went to Nanjing University in the morning to mobilize professors to air their views, went to Nanjing Pharmaceutical College in the afternoon to mobilize, and even went to Nanjing Institute of Technology in the pouring rain to make a report in the evening. After returning, he also said, "If there is a fourth meeting, I am still willing to go." He boasted triumphantly to others: "I am a rocket launcher, setting fires everywhere."
　　After the People's Daily published the editorial "Why Is This?" on June 8, Chen Minzhi, this rightist element, was not reconciled to his failure. On the one hand, he "supported" the People's Daily editorial with great enthusiasm at the symposium convened by the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and on the other hand, he launched everyone to attack the People's Daily editorial at the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, and told everyone that no journalists were participating today. Li Bingxiang (member of the Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League and deputy head of Xuanwu District of Nanjing), a rightist element in the League, complained for Chu Anping at the meeting, and clamored: "I would rather suffer myself, but I cannot let Chu Anping suffer." Some people also expressed dissatisfaction with the title of the People's Daily's "Noteworthy Trends of the China Democratic League." Chen Minzhi publicly declared: The glorious history of our League cannot be erased by a mere journalist.
　　Soon, the anti-rightist struggle in Jiangsu Province and Nanjing Municipality was launched vigorously. Seeing the wind, Chen Minzhi steered the rudder, turned the flower spear, and adopted various means in an attempt to muddle through. On the one hand, he said that the China Democratic League should stand on the forefront of the struggle and take the lead, and on the other hand, he convened a cadre meeting within the League to arrange a retreat. He said, "Do we only have this level? How can we not say the wrong thing?" "Zhang Bojun only has some old democratic ideas, just review them," "Luo Longji has no big problem, just a rehabilitation committee," "Chu Anping is a scholar, deliberately making shocking remarks." From June 18 to 24, he made many mobilization reports at Nanjing Normal College and Nanjing University, and also said: "There is no problem with the Jiangsu League," "We must support the rectification of friendly parties," and so on. It was not until the grassroots League members questioned the weakness of the League Provincial and Municipal Committees in the anti-rightist struggle, and the Xinhua Daily successively published two essays, "A Record of Solving Mysteries with Clever Words" and "Inexplicable," exposing his tricks, that the masses reluctantly dragged out two rightist elements, Fan Guang and Li Bingxiang, for exposure and criticism. From their accounts, Chen Minzhi's part of the reactionary words and deeds were revealed. Some League members saw the essence of the problem, and many grassroots branches posted big-character posters to the meeting rooms of the League Provincial and Municipal Committees. Seeing that the trend could not be avoided, Chen Minzhi wanted to drag the seven people who participated in the League Central April meeting to jointly examine. When this plan failed, he used another plan. He distorted the opinions of the Provincial United Front Work Department, arranged the rankings, and asked the nine members of the former rectification group of the China Democratic League to "go into the water one by one," and clamored that the United Front Work Department still wanted him to "take command." After this vicious rogue method was exposed, recently, he made six extremely insincere reviews in a row.
　　At the enlarged cadre meeting of the Provincial and Municipal Committees of the China Democratic League on August 19, Chen Minzhi's "leftist" mask has been completely torn off. However, he still refused to confess his reactionary words and deeds. Many speakers said that they must fight him and his accomplices to the end.

　　自吹是“党外布尔什维克”　实际是反共的“火箭炮”
　　陈敏之的画皮被剥开了
    本报讯　江苏省和南京市民盟组织的反右派斗争，为何在近两个月的时间内没有开展起来，这一
  “谜”底已经在最近被揭开了。原来自称为是“党外布尔什维克”的、一度掌握了盟内反右派斗争领导权的民盟江苏省、南京市委员会主任委员陈敏之，就是一个乔装改扮成左派的右派骨干分子，是章罗集团在江苏和南京的“火箭炮手”。直到8月11日，盟内的进步力量改组了整风委员会，把反右派斗争的领导权从陈敏之手中拿过来，并连续举行了多次会议，才使这个披着画皮的右派分子很快地现了原形。他的同谋者南京市民盟副主任委员、右派分子樊光等人，也正在被群众包围中。
    据最近的揭发，陈敏之原来是一个老练的两面派，一向以进步面目欺骗共产党和蒙蔽群众。在民盟内部，他担任了民盟中央委员、江苏和南京市的主任委员，在江苏，他还担任了省人民代表、省人民委员会副秘书长等职务。在一切公开场合，陈敏之口口声声拥护共产党，标榜自己“始终和党在一起”、“党怎么说，我就怎么跟着喊”、“没有党就没有盟，盟对党没有秘密”，把自己打扮成一个十足的“左派”，而实际上却对共产党口蜜腹剑，坚决向党进攻。今年，盟中央的四月会议上，陈敏之担任小组召集人，为章罗集团在会上策划的反共反社会主义阴谋的三十条建议辩护，活动非常积极。章伯钧曾亲自请他吃过饭，和他谈过“两院制”等问题，罗隆基集团的大将潘光旦也曾到陈的房间里密谈。可是，在他回到南京以后，却又在中共省、市委负责同志面前说他对“民盟中央的歪风早有所闻，这次会议气氛就不正常”。
    陈敏之回到南京的第二天，就急急忙忙打长途电话把各地民盟负责人召到南京，和南京市盟员一起，开了三天的会议。会上，他歪曲了毛主席在最高国务会议上的报告的内容，又将章罗集团的反动言论，大肆向盟员灌输。说什么“民盟过去是扛旗打伞的，今后要独立思考”，并说自己过去“腰干不硬，见到党员领导同志在场，不敢多说半句话，给群众看了像个小瘪三”。他煽动大家在鸣放时，“只许讲缺点，不许讲成绩”、“不怕片面”、“不怕不正确”。很多盟员称这个会是陈敏之的“点火大会”，受毒很深。最近，陈敏之才被迫承认：这次会议“一是贩运毒素；二是撒下火种；三是交下令箭。”
    此后，江苏省和南京市民盟组织在陈敏之、樊光的策划下，利用鸣放向党进攻，异常积极。在4月18日，陈敏之在发给各基层组织的通知中，在江苏省人代会中的九三民盟成员联合座谈会和光明日报召集的九大城市座谈会之一的南京座谈会上，陈敏之都对党作了恶毒的攻击。在光明日报的座谈会上，说什么高等院校党与非党、党团员和老教师的关系“不协调”，“甚至有些紧张”，“症结问题是体制问题”。省人代会刚闭幕，他就召开干部会布置开一个月的座谈会，让南京六百个盟员每人都放一次。同时，他们还共同策划了学制、体制、政法等座谈会，到处点火，搜集向党进攻的“子弹”。5月17日，他又亲自向华东农业科学研究所的盟员作报告，煽动大家要“单刀直入”。5月20日以后，陈敏之和樊光共同召集了三次中学基层盟员会，在南京市中学里大肆点火。5月25日，中共南京市委整风步骤下达，确定中学暂不整风，陈敏之公开抗拒，对统战部干部说：“你们被动了，又把我们搞被动”、“我们坚决不同意转”、“群众已经起来了，火已经点上了”、“即使来个大民主也没有关系”。6月3日这一天，陈敏之上午到南京大学动员教授鸣放，下午去南京药学院做动员，晚上还冒着倾盆大雨到南京工学院做报告。回来后还说“如果有第四个会，我还是愿意去”。他得意忘形地向人夸耀：“我是火箭炮，到处放火”。
    6月8日，人民日报发表“这是为什么”的社论后，陈敏之这个右派分子并不甘心他的失败。他一面在中共江苏省委召开的座谈会上，慷慨激昂地“拥护”人民日报的社论，一面又在民盟南京市委会上发动大家攻击人民日报社论，还告诉大家，今天没有新闻记者参加。盟内右派分子李秉祥（民盟市委委员、南京市玄武区副区长）在会上为储安平抱不平，扬言说：“宁愿自己吃亏，不能让储安平吃亏”，还有人对人民日报的“可注意的民盟动向”的标题表示不满，陈敏之公开宣称：我们盟的光荣历史，不能给区区一个新闻记者所抹煞。
    不久，江苏省和南京市的反右派斗争轰轰烈烈地开展起来了。陈敏之见风使舵，掉转花枪，采取各种手段，企图蒙混过关。他一面说民盟要站在斗争最前线，带头打先锋，一面召集盟内干部会，布置退却。说什么“我们只有这样的水平吗，那能不说错话”，“章伯钧不过有些旧民主主义思想，检讨检讨就行了”，“罗隆基问题不大，就是一个平反委员会”，“储安平是文人，故作惊人之笔”，6月18日到24日，他在南京师范学院、南京大学多次做动员报告，还说什么：“江苏盟没有问题”、“要支援友党整风”等等。直到基层盟员对盟省、市委在反右派斗争中软弱无力提出了质问，新华日报上又连续发表了“妙语解谜记”、“百思不解”两篇杂谈，揭穿了他的花招，才被群众勉强拖出了两个右派分子樊光和李秉祥，进行揭露和批判。从他们的交代中，揭发了陈敏之的一部分反动言行，有些盟员看清了问题的本质，许多基层支部把大字报贴到民盟省市委会的会议室来了。陈敏之看风头躲不过去，又要拖参加盟中央四月会议的七个人共同检查。此计不行，又使一计。他又歪曲省委统战部的意见，排好名次，要民盟前整风小组的九个委员“个个下水”，并扬言说：统战部还是要他“挂帅”。这一恶毒的无赖手段被揭穿以后，最近，他才连续六次作了极不深刻的检查。
    在8月19日民盟省、市委扩大干部会议上，陈敏之的“左派”假面具已被彻底撕破了。可是，他还坚不交代自己的反动言行。许多发言者都表示，一定要跟他和他的同谋者斗争到底。
