Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch: Tokyo News: Professors, staff, and students of the Tokyo Institute of Technology issued a joint statement on August 8th, stating that they refuse to participate in the manufacture, equipping, experimentation, and research of nuclear weapons.

This joint statement, signed by 70% of the faculty, staff, and students of the entire school, will be read at the Third World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament, and will be mailed to approximately one hundred industrial schools in Japan and many countries, including the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union.

Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch: According to a TASS dispatch from London: Forty-three prominent British scientists today sent an appeal to all scientists of the world, calling for striving for a ban on nuclear weapons testing.

The appeal condemns Britain for devoting its main efforts to scientific research in the military field instead of devoting science entirely to peace and service to humanity.

Professor Lonsdale, a Fellow of the Royal Society (British Academy of Sciences), and Professor Penrose also signed the appeal.

In addition, a group of social, political, cultural, and religious figures in Wales, Britain, called on residents to sign a petition to the British government against nuclear weapons testing.

The petition calls on the British government to strive for the conclusion of an "international agreement on the cessation of hydrogen bomb testing as the first step towards a complete ban on atomic weapons."

Signatories to the petition include Reverend Richards, President of the Welsh and Monmouthshire Baptist Union, Labour MPs Hughes and Roberts.

The petition received enthusiastic support from participants in the National Folk Singers' Congress held in Wales.
