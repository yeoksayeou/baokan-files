    Reading Old Books
    Feng Wenbing
    The purpose of writing this short article is to express my extremely firm opposition to today's rightists. Why use the three characters "Reading Old Books" as the title? It's because I saw in the newspapers exposing materials that the rightist leader Zhang Bojun advocated reading old books, such as Confucius's Analects. Today, the old book I'm talking about reading is Mencius.
    If we arm our minds with the proletarian worldview, then the books of Confucius and Mencius are worth reading today. First of all, they can educate the rightists to have a sense of right and wrong.
    Now I will read Mencius.
    Mencius said to King Xuan of Qi: "Your Majesty's failure to be a true king is not because you are unable, but because you do not do it." That is to say, to run the country well, how can there be a question of ability? It's just a matter of not making an effort. However, in modern times, that is, from the time of the defeat in the Opium War, we always felt that the "inability" component of China's problems was large, and we could not catch up with the great powers. Every patriot had suffering. Today, we want to build a socialist society, it's not a matter of "inability," but only fear of "inaction," and we absolutely must not allow "inaction!" Isn't this very clear? The people's government under the leadership of the Communist Party unites all forces, the Five-Year Plan, the socialist transformation. ... If there are shortcomings or errors in the work, that is of course natural. To do such a great undertaking in such a large country without shortcomings or errors, isn't that telling a myth? Of course, the achievements are the main thing. The American imperialists curse us every day because we have achievements that make them tremble. However, the rightists cannot see the unprecedented achievements that their country has achieved in a few years, and they emphasize shortcomings, which is in line with Mencius's words: "Clear enough to see the tip of an autumn hair, but not see a cartload of firewood!" This proves that they have no sense of right and wrong! In scientific terms, their position is different from that of the people, and they are reactionary.
    Why is China able to be not "unable" now? Can the rightists who observe the tip of an autumn hair see this great reason? Could we have even talked about "developing heavy industry" in the past? That was truly called a dream. For nearly a hundred years, advanced Chinese people have been dreaming this dream, wholeheartedly wanting to learn from foreign countries and admiring the science and technology of Western countries. We now know that this is called a purely technical viewpoint. Chairman Mao once asked us seriously but with great humor: "It's very strange, why do teachers always invade students?" This is to tell us, these rigid minds, that Marxism-Leninism is truly the teacher of semi-colonial China! Yes, Marxism-Leninism guides our agricultural collectivization, and China has the conditions to develop heavy industry. This is called a world-shaking event, a major political event, which is the Chinese revolution led by the Communist Party, which is class struggle. How ridiculous is our past infatuation with learning from the West with a purely technical viewpoint! Turning a backward agricultural country into an industrial country is only a matter of planning today—and the plan must be realized, which relies on the efforts of the people of the whole country. Therefore, today, China's construction of a socialist society is "not a matter of inability," but only fear of "inaction." "Inaction" means that the rightists want to turn back the clock. Will the people allow it?
    Mencius was an idealist, but idealists also have their own deep understanding of the exploiting classes: "Can the unkind be spoken to? They are at ease with their dangers and profit from their disasters, and they are happy with the reasons for their demise! If the unkind can be spoken to, then why would there be a downfall of the country and the ruin of the family?" I think these words are enough to explain the essence of the exploiting classes. The Chinese rightists, to this day, what they are "at ease" with, what they "profit" from, and what they are "happy" with are all in extreme opposition to the people, which is truly dangerous.
    The Chinese people must build a socialist society under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party!

    读古书
    冯文炳
    我写这篇小文的意思，是表示我极其坚决地反对今天的右派。为什么用“读古书”这三个字做题目呢？是因为我在报纸上看见的揭发的材料右派头儿章伯钧主张读古书，如孔子的论语等。我今天谈的读古书，是读孟子。
    如果我们以无产阶级的宇宙观武装我们的头脑，则孔孟之书到今天是值得一读的，它首先能够教育右派分子要有是非之心。
    下面我就读孟子。
    孟子对着齐宣王说：“王之不王，不为也，非不能也。”就是说要把国家搞好，哪里有什么能不能的问题呢？只怕不努力。然而在近代，也就是说从鸦片战争失败那时起，我们总觉得中国问题是“不能”的成分多，赶不上列强，爱国者谁都有苦闷。到今天，我们要建设社会主义社会，不是“不能”，只怕“不为”，又决不许“不为”！这不很明白吗？共产党领导的人民政府团结一切力量，五年计划，社会主义改造。……如果说工作当中有缺点或错误，那是当然的，在这样大的国做这么大的事业而能不有缺点或错误，那不是说神话吗？当然，成绩是主要的，美帝国主义者天天咒骂我们就因为我们有令他们发抖的成绩。然而右派分子却看不见自己国家几年工夫得到的前无古人的成绩，强调缺点，这就合了孟子的话：“明足以察秋毫之末，而不见舆薪！”这证明他们没有是非之心！用科学的话说，他们的立场同人民不一样，他们是反动的立场。
    中国现在何以能够不是“不能”？察秋毫之末的右派分子看得见这个大原故吗？“发展重工业”在过去，我们谈得上这一句话吗？那真叫做梦。近百年来，先进的中国人都在做这个梦，一心想学外国，羡慕西方国家的科学技术。我们现在知道，这叫做单纯技术观点。毛主席曾经严肃地然而很有风趣地问过我们：“很奇怪，为什么先生老是侵略学生呢？”这就是告诉我们这些死脑筋，马克思列宁主义才真是半殖民地中国的先生！是的，马克思列宁主义指导我们农业合作化了，中国有发展重工业的条件了，这叫做翻天覆地的大事，这是政治大事，就是共产党领导的中国革命，就是阶级斗争。可笑的是我们过去单纯技术观点的学西方的迷梦！把落后的农业国变为工业国，在今天只是一个计划问题——而计划是一定要实现的，这靠全国人民的努力。所以今天中国建设社会主义社会，“非不能也”，只怕“不为”。“不为”就是右派分子要开倒车，人民允许吗？
    孟子是唯心论者，唯心论者对剥削阶级也有他的深刻的认识：“不仁者，可与言哉？安其危而利其灾，乐其所以亡者！不仁而可与言，则何亡国败家之有？”我认为这番话足以说明剥削阶级的本质。中国的右派，时至今日，他们所“安”所“利”，所“乐”，都是同人民处于极端相反的地位，真是危险。
    中国人民一定要在中国共产党领导之下建设社会主义社会！
