　　Saving Cotton Cloth Benefits the Country and the Individual
　　Buying and Selling Cloth Ration Coupons is Illegal
　　This newspaper reports that recently, criminal acts of buying and selling cloth ration coupons have been discovered in various places. This should be taken seriously and should be prosecuted according to the law.
    Shaanxi
    The black market for cloth ration coupons in Xi'an City is extremely rampant. The Zhongshanmen Police Station discovered four peddlers in one day carrying more than 1,600 *shi chi* (a Chinese unit of length, approximately 1/3 of a meter) of cloth ration coupons to sell in the market, priced at 0.15 yuan per 10 *chi*. There were also cloth coupon dealers who used the purchased cloth coupons to obtain ready-made clothes from department stores and supply and marketing cooperatives in various places, and then sold them in the market at a price 30% higher than the market price without requiring cloth coupons.
    Liaoning
    In Chaoyang County, Liaoning Province, some merchants bought and sold cloth ration coupons everywhere in the countryside at a price of 0.05 yuan per *chi* of cloth ration coupon, or exchanging 5 *chi* of cloth ration coupons for 1 *jin* (a Chinese unit of weight, approximately 1/2 of a kilogram) of grain coupons. Guo Fengsheng of Xiajiao Township, Yangshan District of the county, bought more than 220 *chi* of cloth ration coupons in the township on June 24th and 25th and sold them in Fuxin, Anshan and other places. This behavior seriously undermined the state's cotton cloth purchase and sale policy and affected social order.
    Anhui
    The Anhui Provincial Textile Company reported that since the second phase of cloth ration coupons were used at half the face value, the buying and selling of cloth ration coupons has increased. For example, on June 24th, the Bengbu Cotton Cloth General Store discovered three peddlers, Wu Xuebao and others, selling 2,500 *chi* of cloth ration coupons at a price of 0.03 yuan per *chi*. There was an eight-person small group in Randeng Township, Xihe District, Fengyang County that frequently sold cloth ration coupons, and there was also selling of cloth ration coupons in Hefei, Mingguang and Chuxian.
    Jiangsu
    In mid-June, the relevant departments in Nantong City uncovered four cases of transporting cloth ration coupons at the port, with a total of more than 13,500 *chi* of cloth ration coupons being transported. These cloth ration coupons were purchased from farmers at 2 yuan per 100 *chi* and were prepared to be taken to Shanghai for sale.
    Zhejiang
    In Si'an Town, Changxing County, Zhejiang, the private sale of cloth ration coupons even had a unified market price. Before the second phase of cloth ration coupons were used at half the face value, each 22-*chi* coupon sold for 0.4 yuan, and now it has risen to 0.7 yuan. In Dongtou County, the buying and selling of cloth ration coupons has changed from being secret to being public. In Ruian, Pingyang and other places, many people are taking cloth ration coupons to sell. It was discovered in Caota Town, Zhuji County, that the clothing industry in Shanghai had sent people to search for and buy cloth ration coupons, and people were also found in Simen and Zhouxing in Yuyao to purchase cloth ration coupons to sell in Shanghai. According to the Jiaxing Branch Company, cloth coupon dealer Cai Shengming purchased more than 4,700 *chi* of cloth ration coupons from farmers in the Wenzhou area. The Changxing County People's Court has sentenced Cai Shengming to six months in prison, and the proceeds from the sale of cloth ration coupons and the cloth ration coupons have been confiscated according to law.

    本报讯　最近各地仍然发现有买卖布票的犯罪行为，应当引起重视，并应追究法办。
    陕西
    西安市布票黑市买卖十分猖獗。中山门派出所一天中即查出四个小贩，携带布票一千六百多市尺，在市场出售，每十尺售价一角五分。还有布票贩以收购的布票向各地百货公司、供销社套购成衣，在市场上不收布票但高出市价30％出售。辽　宁
    辽宁省朝阳县有一些商人，以每尺布票五分钱，或五尺布票换一斤粮票的办法，在农村到处买卖布票。该县羊山区下窖乡郭凤生，今年6月24、25两日在该乡收买了二百二十多尺布票去阜新、鞍山等地出卖。这种行为严重地破坏了国家的棉布购销政策，影响社会秩序。
    安徽

    6月中旬南通市有关部门在港口查获贩运布票事件四起，共贩运布票一万三千五百多市尺，这些布票是以每百尺二元向农民购来，准备带到上海出售。
    浙江
    浙江长兴县泗安镇私卖布票竟有统一市价，在第二期布票对折前，每张二十二尺售价四角，现在涨至七角；洞头县买卖布票已由秘密转为公开，瑞安、平阳等地有不少人把布票贩去出售。诸暨县草塔镇发现上海的服装业派人来搜买布票，余姚的泗门、周行等地也发现有人搜购布票到上海出售。据嘉兴分公司反映：布票贩子蔡生明从温州地区向农民收买布票四千七百多市尺。长兴县人民法院已判处蔡生明徒刑六个月，贩卖布票款及布票依法没收。
