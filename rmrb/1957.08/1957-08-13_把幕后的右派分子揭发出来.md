Expose the Rightists Behind the Scenes

    This newspaper reports that the Anhui Normal College has exposed Li Min (a Communist Party member and teacher in the Marxist-Leninist Teaching and Research Office), a rightist element hidden behind the scenes, who was the "military advisor" for the rightists' attack on socialism. After the Great Blooming and Letting of Views, Li Min incited students in the classroom, saying, "Students, show the spirit of the 'May Fourth' Movement and stand up to fight!" The rightist element Chu Maolong took the extremely reactionary "Twenty Articles Program" of Nanjing University to consult him, and he expressed that he agreed with some of the articles. When the rightists' reactionary arrogance was rampant, someone asked Li Min why the reporters didn't report it. He said, "If they don't report it, you can put up big-character posters." As a result, big-character posters appeared in front of the Wuhu reporter station of the Anhui Daily, in which rightist elements from the Normal College cursed the reporters. When the Communist Youth League branch called on the members to adhere to the six principles that are beneficial to socialist construction during the blooming and letting of views, he told the rightist elements, "I don't think what you are saying violates the six principles." With the development of the anti-rightist struggle, this traitor, who betrayed the Party in 1938 and recognized the enemy as his father, and who sneaked into the Party for the second time during the Liberation War, could not hide his betrayal of the Party! His reactionary arguments have also been refuted. (Yu Feng)

    把幕后的右派分子揭发出来
    本报讯　安徽师范学院揭发出隐藏在幕后的右派分子李敏（共产党员，马列主义教研室教员），他是右派分子向社会主义进攻的“军师”。大鸣大放后，李敏在课堂上煽动学生说：“同学们，拿出‘五四’的精神，站起来斗争吧！”右派分子储茂隆拿着极端反动的南大“二十条大纲”去请教他，他表示：有些条文他是同意的。在右派分子反动气焰嚣张时，有人问李敏，记者为什么不报道？他说：“不报道，你们可以贴大字报。”于是，在安徽日报驻芜湖记者站的门口便出现了师范学院右派分子谩骂记者的大字报，当团总支号召共青团员在鸣放中要本着有利于社会主义建设的六项原则时，他告诉右派分子说：“我看你们所鸣放的并没有不符合六项原则。”随着反右斗争的开展，这位1938年叛党后认贼作父、在解放战争中第二次混入党内的叛徒，始终掩盖不了他的叛党行为！他的反动论点也已被驳倒。　（于风）
