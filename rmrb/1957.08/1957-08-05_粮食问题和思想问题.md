Over the past year, what has been the state of our country's grain situation? This is a question of universal concern. To answer this question, we must first look at two aspects of the facts: on the one hand, the amount of grain procured by the state has decreased by 3.9 billion catties compared to the previous year. On the other hand, the amount of grain sold in the domestic market has increased by more than 12.7 billion catties compared to the previous year. Among them, sales in rural areas increased by more than 6.8 billion catties, and sales in cities increased by more than 5.9 billion catties. The trend of increasing grain sales continues this year. With procurement decreasing and sales increasing, it is inevitable that the state's grain reserves must be used. This is a very unfavorable situation.

Has our country's grain production decreased? No. It is a fact that China suffered natural disasters in 1956. However, thanks to agricultural cooperation and the state's support for agriculture in various aspects, the total national grain output still increased. This year's summer harvest is generally not bad either. But why has the amount of procurement decreased? This is because although many regions have had good harvests, socialist education for farmers has been relaxed, and individualism and localism have grown in rural areas. As long as ideological education is strengthened, the amount of grain procured can be greatly increased. The example of Shanggao Township in Tai'an County, Shandong, published in today's newspaper, powerfully answers this question.

The original plan for grain purchase in Shanggao Township, Tai'an County, was 770,000 catties. This number was not high to begin with. However, local cadres lacked confidence in completing it, and they were even afraid that they would not be able to complete even 560,000 catties. However, after conducting in-depth socialist and patriotic education for the broad masses, clarifying their thinking, and fundamentally changing everyone's erroneous attitude towards selling surplus grain, from a negative attitude to a positive attitude, the result was not only the completion of the original plan, but also a great exceeding of the plan, completing 830,000 catties.

The example of Shanggao Township shows that there is an ideological problem within the grain problem. When ideology regresses towards capitalism, the grain problem becomes tense; conversely, when ideology advances towards socialism, the grain problem tends to ease.

The current grain problem is obviously caused by the failure to solve some ideological problems. Generally speaking, there are some erroneous ideas among the peasant masses and rural cadres that need to be criticized.

First of all, we should criticize the individualistic thinking of only caring about oneself and not caring about the country. This kind of thinking is inherent in individual farmers. In the past, after long-term revolutionary wars and post-liberation revolutionary struggles, many farmers have overcome this kind of thinking, and their patriotic consciousness has been greatly improved. However, because we did not have time to conduct an in-depth socialist ideological education during and after the socialist upsurge of agricultural cooperation, many farmers' ideological understanding has not kept up with the developing situation. Some people even feel that: after cooperation, my land and other means of production have been nationalized, and I am a "public person," so everything should be fully supplied by the public, and a supply system should be implemented. In the past, minor laborers and children in the family mostly ate thin porridge, but now they all have to eat dry food. In the past, they ate less during the slack season, but now they eat as much as during the busy season. After eating, they reach out to the cooperative, and if the cooperative does not give it, they make a fuss. They feel that eating more is pure profit, and eating less is a loss. In You County, Hunan, some farmers eat 800 or 900 catties of grain per person per year, and still clamor that it is not enough. Some say that one person needs to eat 1,200 catties of grain per year to be enough. After the wheat was harvested in Anhui Province, some farmers ate three catties of wheat a day. Among the people who clamor that it is not enough to eat, except for a few who really do not have enough to eat, the vast majority do not lack food, but want to pretend to be grain-deficient households in order to get more grain. Some are well-to-do middle peasants who are dissatisfied with cooperation and hope that the cooperative will collapse; and some are lower-middle peasants and poor peasants who blindly follow the well-to-do middle peasants and have relatively confused ideas. In Jieshu County, Shanxi, nine-tenths of the members of a cooperative shouted that they lacked grain this spring; after education and evaluation, only one-tenth of the members actually lacked grain. If this individualistic thinking of only caring about oneself and not caring about the country is not overcome, our country's socialist construction will be seriously damaged.

Secondly, among the cadres of the cooperatives and townships, some people have serious localism. They only care about the immediate petty advantages of the farmers in their own cooperatives and townships, and cannot see the long-term interests of the farmers and the fundamental interests of the country. They adopt various methods such as collectively concealing yields, underreporting income, overreporting losses, and overreporting grain shortages, so that their own townships and cooperatives can sell less surplus grain and get more supplies. As a result of recent education for grassroots cadres in Cang County, Hebei, many people have raised their awareness, and have now reported more than 100,000 catties of concealed grain yield. At present, this work of self-reporting grain is still continuing. This proves that the localist thinking of township and cooperative cadres must be overcome, and can be overcome.

Furthermore, some cadres above the county level also understand the purpose of cooperation very narrowly, thinking that cooperation is simply for everyone to get more distribution and eat more fully now. They rarely think about the socialist cause of the entire country and the future of the peasants. If it is necessary to limit grain consumption for the benefit of the entire country, they feel that this is "unfair to the peasants," as if they have done something wrong. These people unilaterally recognize the mass viewpoint advocated by the Party, thinking that the mass viewpoint is simply to strive for the immediate welfare of the masses; as for how to educate the peasants with advanced ideas so that the peasants can see their long-term interests, they do not pay attention. Therefore, they rarely carry out necessary criticism and correction of the localism of township and cooperative cadres and the individualism of peasants. This has allowed these erroneous ideas to spread.

Now we are facing a serious ideological task, which is to explain to the broad masses of peasants and rural cadres: if we disregard national interests and the entire socialist cause, and put the interests of individuals and our own units first, then we are in fact abolishing socialism, abolishing the leadership of the Party, and also abolishing the long-term future of the peasants. On the grain issue, every member and cadre of an agricultural cooperative can be tested to see who truly supports socialism and who is truly patriotic. This is a practical test, not comparable to expressing attitudes verbally.

Some comrades believe that the contradiction between national tasks and the needs of the masses is insurmountable, and the two cannot be taken into account at the same time. They have forgotten that our country is a country led by the working class, and that building socialism is in the greatest interest of the greatest number of people. Therefore, the tasks of the state and the demands of the people are fundamentally unified. Of course, not everything goes smoothly in actual work, and there will inevitably be difficulties. Precisely because of this, we need to conduct arduous investigations and research, come up with various methods, and carry out fair and reasonable distribution, on the one hand, not wasting grain, and on the other hand, ensuring that farmers have enough to eat and no one goes hungry. And such consideration is possible. Of course, the grain supply for people in urban industrial and mining areas, cash crop areas, and disaster areas should also be limited to a certain extent, and not every request can be granted.

On the grain issue, we must use a global perspective to educate cadres and the masses. The urban industrial and mining areas, which account for one-seventh of the population, the disaster areas, which account for about one-tenth of the population on average each year, and the cash crop areas, which account for nearly one-tenth of the country's cultivated land, all need the state to supply grain. If the state does not supply grain, the industrial production and capital construction, transportation and other construction undertakings in urban industrial and mining areas cannot be carried out; the economic crop areas cannot supply industrial raw materials, and the accumulation of funds for industrialization will be greatly affected; the broad masses of people in disaster areas will not be able to carry out production for self-relief, and social order will naturally be adversely affected.

In order to build a great socialist motherland, we must resolutely overcome various erroneous ideas, and strive to increase the amount of grain collection and purchase, reduce grain sales, and increase the country's grain reserves from all aspects, so that we can cope with possible famines and other difficulties. During the first five-year plan period, 1954 and 1956 were disaster years. These two disaster years almost coincided. Obviously, if the state cannot accumulate sufficient grain reserves to cope with two consecutive disaster years, our plan cannot be considered very secure and reliable. Therefore, we hope that all Communist Party members and state functionaries will give full play to their initiative on the grain issue, set an example, lead the masses, strive to control grain consumption, and sell more surplus grain to the state. We believe that after the broad masses of cadres and the masses understand the basic situation of the country's grain, they will definitely be able to actively respond to the Party's call and strive to complete the tasks on the grain front.

### 粮食问题和思想问题

    粮食问题和思想问题
    过去一年中，我们国家的粮食状况是怎么样的呢？这是人们普遍关心的问题。要回答这个问题，先要看两方面的事实：一方面，国家征购所得的粮食比上一年度少了三十九亿斤。另一方面，国内市场销售的粮食比上一年度增加了一百二十七亿多斤。其中农村多销六十八亿多斤，城市多销五十九亿多斤。今年粮食销量还有继续增加的趋势。征购减少了，销售要增加，这就不能不动用国家的粮食库存。这是十分不利的情况。
    是不是我国粮食的生产减少了呢？不是的。1956年我国遭受了自然灾害，这是事实。但是，由于农业合作化和国家在各方面对农业的支援，全国粮食总产量还是增加了。今年的夏收，一般的也并不坏。可是，为什么征购数目减少了呢？这是由于很多地区粮食虽然丰收了，但是对农民的社会主义教育却放松了，农村中滋长了个人主义和本位主义。只要加强了思想教育，粮食征购教目就可以大为增加。今天本报发表的山东泰安县上高乡征购粮食的事例，有力地回答了这个问题。
    泰安县上高乡购粮的原定计划是七十七万斤。这个数目本来不高。可是当地干部都缺少完成的信心，他们甚至害怕连五十六万斤也完成不了。但是，经过对广大群众进行深入的社会主义和爱国主义的教育，打通了思想，从根本上改变了大家对于卖余粮的错误态度，从消极态度转为积极态度，结果不仅完成了原订计划，而且大大地超过计划，完成了八十三万斤。
    上高乡的事例说明，粮食问题里面有思想问题。在思想向着资本主义方向倒退的时候，粮食问题就紧张起来；相反的，在思想朝着社会主义方向前进的时候，粮食问题就会趋向缓和。
    目前的粮食问题显然是由于有些思想问题没有解决而引起的。一般地说来，现时在农民群众和农村干部中有一些错误的思想需要加以批判。
    首先应该批判只顾自己、不顾国家的个人主义思想。这种思想是个体农民所固有的。过去经过长期的革命战争和解放以后革命斗争的教育，许多农民已经克服了这种思想，爱国主义的觉悟已经大大提高。但是，由于我们在农业合作化的社会主义高潮期间和以后，没有来得及进行一次深入的社会主义思想教育，所以还有许多农民思想认识没有跟上发展的形势。有一些人甚至觉得：合作化了，我的土地和其他生产资料都归公了，我是“公家人”了，于是一切都要由公家充分供给，实行供给制。从前家庭内次要劳动力和小孩多半吃稀的，现在一律要吃干的。从前在农闲时节吃得较少，现在也和农忙时节一样多吃。吃完了就伸手向社里要，社里不给就吵闹。他们觉得吃多了是净赚，吃少了就吃亏。湖南攸县有的农民一年一人吃八、九百斤谷，还嚷着不够，有的说一人一年要吃一千二百斤谷才够。安徽省小麦收了以后，有的农民一天吃三斤小麦。在叫嚷不够吃的人们里面，除了少数人真的不够吃以外，其余大多数并不是不够吃，而是想把自己装成缺粮户，以便多要粮食。有一部分是对合作化心怀不满，希望合作社垮台的富裕中农；也有一部分是盲目地追随富裕中农、思想比较糊涂的下中农和贫农。山西解虞县有一个社今春有十分之九的社员喊缺粮；后来经过教育和评议，实际上只有十分之一的社员缺粮。这种只顾自己、不顾国家的个人主义思想如果不克服，我国的社会主义建设就会受到严重的损害。
    其次，在社和乡的干部中，有一些人有严重的本位主义。他们只顾本社本乡的农民眼前的一点小便宜，看不到农民的长远利益和国家的根本利益。他们采取集体隐瞒产量、少报收入、多报损失、多报缺粮等各种办法，使本乡本社可以少卖余粮，多得供应。河北沧县最近对基层干部进行教育的结果，许多人觉悟提高，现在已经报出隐瞒的粮食产量十多万斤。目前这种自报粮食的工作还在继续中。这证明乡、社干部的本位主义思想是必须克服的，也是能够克服的。
    还有，县以上的干部有些也把合作化的目的了解得非常狭窄，以为合作化就是单纯为了大家现在分得多一些，吃得更饱一些。他们很少想到整个国家的社会主义事业和农民的前途问题。如果为了整个国家的利益而需要限制一下粮食的消费，他们就觉得这是“对不起农民”，好像作了亏心事。这些人片面地认识党所提倡的群众观点，以为群众观点就是单纯为群众争取眼前的福利；至于说怎样用先进的思想去教育农民，使农民看得见自己的远大利益，他们就不加以注意。因此，他们对于乡、社干部的本位主义和农民的个人主义，很少进行必要的批判和纠正。这就使得这些错误的思想蔓延起来。
    现在我们已经面临着一个严重的思想工作，这就是要向广大的农民群众和农村干部说明：如果不顾国家利益和整个社会主义事业，要把个人的和本单位的利益放在第一位，那就是在实际上取消了社会主义，取消了党的领导，同时也取消了农民的远大前途。在粮食问题上完全可以考验每一个农业社的社员和干部，究竟谁是真正拥护社会主义的，谁是真正爱国的。这是实际的考验，不是口头上表示态度所可比。
    有的同志认为，国家任务和群众需要之间的矛盾是无法克服的，二者是不能兼顾的。他们忘记了我们的国家是工人阶级领导的国家，我们要建设社会主义这是符合最大多数人民的最大利益的，因此，国家的任务和人民的要求在根本上是统一的。当然，在实际工作中不是一切都顺利，总不免会有困难。正因为这样，我们才需要进行艰苦的调查和研究工作，想出各种办法，进行公平合理的分配，一面不要浪费粮食，一面要使农民够吃，不使有人挨饿。而这样的兼顾是可能的。当然，城市工矿区、经济作物区和灾区人民的粮食供应量也要有一定的限制，不能有求必应。
    我们在粮食问题上必须用全局观点来教育干部和群众。占人口七分之一的城市工矿区，平均每年大约占人口十分之一左右的受灾地区，占全国耕地面积近十分之一的经济作物地区，统统需要国家供应粮食。国家如果不供应粮食，城市工矿区的工业生产和基本建设、交通和其他建设事业就不能进行；经济作物区就不能供给工业原料，工业化资金的积累就会受到重大影响；灾区广大人民也就不能进行生产自救，社会秩序当然也就会受到不利的影响。
    为了建设伟大的社会主义祖国，我们必须坚决克服各种错误思想，从各方面努力来增加征粮和购粮的数量，缩减粮食的销量，增加国家的粮食储备，使我们能够应付可能遇到的灾荒和其他困难。在第一个五年计划期间，1954年和1956年都是灾年。这两个灾年差一点连在一起。很明显，如果国家不能积聚起足以应付连续两个灾年的粮食储备，我们的计划就不能认为是十分稳妥可靠的。因此，我们希望所有的共产党员和国家工作人员在粮食问题上要充分地发挥积极性，以身作则，带动群众，努力节制粮食消费，多卖余粮给国家。我们相信广大干部和群众在明白了国家粮食基本的情况以后，一定能够积极响应党的号召，努力完成粮食战线上的任务。
