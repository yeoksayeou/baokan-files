Publishing Work—Shouldn't We Learn from the Soviet Union?
Chen Yuan

Whether or not to learn from the Soviet Union in publishing is a major issue of right and wrong. On this issue, we have fundamental differences with the right-wing elements. We say that we should first learn from the Soviet Union, mainly learn from the Soviet Union; the right-wing elements say that we should not learn from the Soviet Union because the Soviet Union's "institutions and systems are backward," the Soviet Union has nothing, only dogmatism. We say that we have learned correctly from the Soviet Union since liberation and have made great achievements; the right-wing elements say that learning from the Soviet Union in recent years has been "the biggest loss," "if there are achievements, then the achievements are secondary, and the shortcomings are the main ones." These fallacies of the right-wing are what Zeng Yanxiu, deputy director and deputy editor-in-chief of the People's Publishing House, said. Another right-wing element, Lan Yu (deputy editor-in-chief of the Popular Reading Publishing House), spoke more vaguely, saying that he "doubted" this set, this set has caused "countless contradictions and jokes." Zeng Yanxiu summarized the results of learning from the Soviet Union in publishing, and came up with three charges: first, it hindered the development of the publishing industry, second, it hindered the development of science, and third, it hindered freedom of thought. This is terrible! According to the right-wing elements, learning from the Soviet Union is simply a violation of the Constitution. Okay, let us see how the facts refute the fallacies of the right-wing elements.

The right-wing gentlemen deny the achievements of the publishing industry in learning from the Soviet Union, and their attack is first concentrated on the many Soviet works translated and published since liberation. For example, Zeng Yanxiu said arrogantly: "Most of the manpower and paper after liberation were used to translate Soviet pamphlets, which is simply useless. ... It's really a waste of paper, a waste of manpower, inexplicable!" Then he asked: "Can we build a country solely on some dogmatic pamphlets?" Thus, he denied the achievements of publishing Soviet works in a black-and-white manner. He said: "In the past seven or eight years of publishing, ... works cannot be published, but a lot of paper has been wasted on foreigners' nonsense pamphlets." These words are sometimes difficult to understand, because the language of the right-wing is often the opposite of our language, and these words of Zeng Yanxiu also need to be annotated. The dogmatism he opposes is the Marxism-Leninism that we want to promote; the foreigners' nonsense pamphlets he criticizes are the works of Soviet scholars promoting Marxism-Leninism and scientific knowledge that we support; the pamphlets he said do not actually refer to small books, but broadly refer to Soviet books that the right-wing gentlemen do not like. Didn't Zeng Yanxiu say this? "After liberation, academic works were basically stopped, and Soviet pamphlets were allowed to flood the market." It can be seen that the pamphlets in his mind are actually synonymous with translated and printed Soviet works.

However, no matter how the right-wing elements oppose it, our publishing industry has still published a large number of translations of Soviet books since liberation. From 1950 to 1956, about 86,000 new books were published for the first time, of which translations of Soviet books exceeded 13,000. Is this a good thing or a bad thing? Right-wing elements such as Zeng Yanxiu said, "waste of paper," of course it is a bad thing; we say it is a good thing. (Although the selection of individual books is inappropriate, generally speaking, it is very good!) What's good about it? There are three points. The first is to promote Marxism-Leninism. May I ask if the successive translations and printing of the complete works of Stalin, the complete works of Lenin, the complete works of Marx and Engels, as well as the documents of the Soviet Communist Party and the Communist Parties of various countries, can be said to be a waste of paper? May I ask if the translation of many large and small books promoting the basic issues of Marxism-Leninism has not given us very good nourishment? Second, through the translation and printing of many professional books, the advanced construction experience and scientific achievements of the Soviet Union have played a great guiding role in China's socialist construction and scientific research. May I ask whether translating such Soviet books hinders the development of science or promotes the development of science? Third, a large number of translations of Soviet books have enriched our spiritual life, expanded the position of socialist ideology, and cultivated the qualities of socialist new people. For example, "How Steel Was Tempered," "The Story of Zoya and Shura," and "The Young Guard" have educated countless soldiers, workers, peasants, youths, students, and cadres. Does this hinder freedom of thought? Has it restricted thought?

Since the right-wing elements deny these, they are looking for the root cause. According to them, this is the result of the publishing system learning from the Soviet Union. Zeng Yanxiu said that the division of labor by specialty, the separation of publishing, printing, and distribution, and (what he fabricated) the editors' attention to technical details, and planned distribution, all hindered the development of the publishing industry." He said that these are some "unified practices" that do not conform to the "double hundred" policy. The last sentence is the finishing touch: it turns out that what Zeng Yanxiu called restricting thought, lacking ideology, etc., all boils down to opposing the so-called "unified." Lan Yu is superficially a skeptic. He doubts the separation of publishing and printing, the professional division of labor of publishing houses, and enterprise management. However, Lan Yu also said that everything is "unified too rigidly." It turns out that it is still the same thing: the "unified" that Lan Yu opposes is the "unified" of Zeng Yanxiu. The right-wing element Hu Ming said it more bluntly. He said that the current practice of publishing houses is "a disguised monopoly." The right-wing element Xiao Qian said it even more clearly. He said, "It is not enough to rely solely on correcting attitudes and improving work style. To solve this problem, we must start with the fundamental system—we must change the objective situation that publishing houses are actually monopolists." What do the right-wing elements mean by opposing "unified" and opposing "monopoly"? It is to oppose placing the publishing industry under the leadership and management of the Communist Party and the people's regime, to reopen the gap and allow the right-wing to freely expand their reactionary ideas as the basis for the restoration of the bourgeoisie.

In this way, the right-wing elements' attack on the publishing industry's learning from the Soviet Union's experience is hitting the key point. The key point is not to have socialism. However, since liberation, what we have learned from the Soviet Union is mainly this experience. We have learned a lot of practices and systems, and established many institutions. In a nutshell, it is how the Party and the state lead and manage publishing work.

It would be very beneficial to review the path we have taken in the past few years. When the whole country was liberated, we immediately unified the scattered Xinhua Bookstores. At that time, state-owned, public-owned, joint state-private, and private bookstores and publishing houses coexisted, and the state-owned Xinhua Bookstore adopted the practice of "all-in-one" (i.e., publishing, printing, and distribution together). However, when the publishing industry was to further serve socialism, this practice would not work. We learned from the Soviet Union's experience and separated publishing and printing from bookstores in a few years, and then successively established 101 central-level and local publishing houses according to their professional nature. At the same time, many large-scale and specialized printing plants were established, as well as 3,359 Xinhua Bookstore branches spread across the country. Are all these measures developing the publishing industry or hindering the publishing industry? Then, we began to engage in planning based on the Soviet Union's experience to bring the entire publishing industry into the orbit of the national plan. We also combined it with China's actual conditions to carry out socialist transformation of the private publishing industry; at the same time, we formulated a series of systems and methods. Although all of these are not without room for improvement, when all is said and done, we have established the leadership of the Party and the state in publishing work and fundamentally changed the capitalist nature of the old Chinese publishing industry. Only in this way can the publishing industry become a part of socialist construction.

The right-wing says, "You monopolize" and make people not free in publishing; we say that the result of the Party and the state leading the publishing industry, the result of the publishing industry embarking on the road of planning, gives the people of the whole country the greatest freedom. The so-called "no freedom" of the right-wing elements is just that reactionary things cannot seize the market. The right-wing says that your "unified" restricts thought; we say that the planned road is our publishing industry's better serving socialist direction and an important measure for spreading socialist ideology. Only reactionary thought feels a little "restricted."

The problem is already very clear. What is the purpose of the right-wing gentlemen denying the achievements of learning from the Soviet Union? It turns out that they are just using opposing learning from the Soviet Union to make an issue and achieve their ulterior motives: to abolish the leadership and management of the Party and the state over the publishing industry. So this is a struggle between two roads—taking the socialist road or taking the capitalist road? This is the fundamental difference between us and the right-wing elements.

### 出版工作难道不要学习苏联？

    出版工作难道不要学习苏联？
    陈原
    在出版方面要不要学习苏联——这是一个大是大非问题。在这个问题上，我们和右派分子有着根本性的分歧。我们说，首先要向苏联学习，主要要向苏联学习；右派分子说，不要向苏联学习，因为苏联的“机构和制度都是落后的”，苏联什么都没有，只有教条主义。我们说，解放以来我们学苏联学对了，有很大的成绩；右派分子说，这几年学苏联“吃亏最大”，“如果说有成绩，那么，成绩是次要的，缺点是主要的”。这些右派的谬论就是人民出版社副社长兼副总编辑曾彦修说的。还有一个右派分子蓝钰（通俗读物出版社副总编辑）讲得比较含糊，他说，他“怀疑”这一套，这一套搞得“矛盾百出，笑话百出”。曾彦修总结了在出版方面学习苏联的结果，得出三条罪状，一曰妨碍了出版事业的发展，二曰妨碍科学的发展，三曰妨碍思想自由。这还了得！照右派分子看来，学习苏联简直是违反宪法了。好，就让我们看看事实怎样驳倒右派分子的谬论吧。
    右派先生们否定出版界学习苏联的成绩，攻击的矛头首先集中在解放以来翻译出版的许多苏联著作上。例如曾彦修狂妄地说：“解放后大部分力量和纸张都用于翻译苏联的小册子，这简直没有用。……真是浪费纸张，浪费人力，莫名其妙！”然后他问道：“我们单靠一些教条主义的小册子就能立国吗？”于是，他颠倒黑白地一口否定了出版苏联著作的成绩。他说：“过去搞七、八年出版，……著作出不了，而对外国人的胡说八道的小册子，却浪费了不少纸张。”这些话有时很不好懂，因为右派的语言往往是和我们的语言相反的，曾彦修这几句话也得加注释。他反对的教条主义，就是我们要宣传的马列主义；他抨击的外国人胡说八道小册子，就是我们拥护的苏联学者宣传马列主义和科学知识的著作；他说的小册子，其实也并非指小本头的书，而是广泛指右派老爷们所不喜欢的苏联书而说的。曾彦修不是这样说过吗？“解放后基本上停止了学术著作，而让苏联的小册子泛滥于市场。”可见他心目中的小册子，其实就是译印的苏联著作的代名词。
    但是，不管右派分子如何反对，解放以来我们出版界还是出了大量苏联书的译本。从1950年到1956年，初版新书出了约八万六千种，其中苏联书的译本就超过一万三千种。这究竟是好事还是坏事呢？右派分子例如曾彦修说，“浪费纸张”，当然是坏事；我们说，这是好事。（尽管个别书籍选择不当，但总的说来，是好得很！）好在那里呢？有三条。第一条是宣传了马列主义。试问斯大林全集、列宁全集、马恩全集以及苏联共产党、各国共产党的文件的陆续译印，难道可以说是浪费纸张吗？试问许多宣传马列主义基本问题的大书小册翻译过来，不是给我们增加十分好的养料么？第二条，是通过许多专业书籍的译印，苏联先进的建设经验和科学成就对中国社会主义建设和科学研究工作起了极大的指导作用。试问翻译这样的苏联书籍是妨碍科学发展还是推动科学发展？第三条，大量苏联书籍的译本丰富了我们的精神生活，扩大了社会主义思想的阵地，培养了社会主义新人的品质。比如，“钢铁是怎样炼成的”、“卓娅和舒拉的故事”和“青年近卫军”，不知教育了我们多少战士、工人、农民、青年、学生和干部。难道这妨碍了思想自由么？束缚了思想么？
    右派分子既然否定这些，他们就寻根子了。据他们说，这都是出版体制学习苏联的结果。曾彦修说，专业分工，出版、印刷、发行分家，以及（他所捏造的）编辑人员注意技术小节，计划发行，都妨碍了出版事业的发展。”他说，这是一些不符合“百花齐放、百家争鸣”方针的“大一统的作法”。最后一句话画龙点睛：原来曾彦修所谓束缚思想、没有思想性等等，归结起来是反对所谓“大一统”。蓝钰表面上是个怀疑论者，他对出版与印刷分家怀疑，对出版社专业分工也怀疑，对企业化也怀疑，但是，蓝钰又说，一切“统得太死”了。原来还是那么一回事：蓝钰反对的“统”，也就是曾彦修的那个“大一统”。右派分子胡明说得更干脆些，他说，现在出版社的做法是“变相的垄断”。右派分子萧乾说得就更明白了，他说，“单靠端正态度，改进作风是不够的。要解决这个问题，必得从根本制度上着手——必须改变出版社实际上处于垄断者的这个客观形势。”右派分子反对“大一统”，反对“垄断”，是什么意思呢？就是反对把出版事业置于共产党和人民政权的领导和管理下，要重新打开缺口，让右派能够自由扩大他们的反动思想，作为资产阶级复辟的基础。
    这样看来，右派分子攻击出版界学习苏联经验是抓中要害的，要害就是不要社会主义。但是，解放以来，我们向苏联学习的，主要正是这个经验。学了很多作法、制度，建立了许多机构，千言万语，不过是一条，就是党和国家怎样领导和管理出版工作。
    让我们回顾一下这几年走过的道路，是大有益处的。当全国解放以后，我们立刻就把分散经营的新华书店统一起来。当时，国营、公营、公私合营和私营书店出版社并存，而国营新华书店是采取“一揽子”（即出版、印刷、发行在一起）作法的。但是，当出版事业要进一步为社会主义服务的时候，这种作法就不行了。我们学习了苏联经验，在几年里面把出版和印刷从书店中分立出来，然后又按专业性质陆续建立了中央一级的和地方的一百零一家出版社。同时，建立了许多大规模的和专门的印刷厂，以及建立了遍布全国的三千三百五十九个新华书店分支机构。所有这些措施，难道不是发展了出版事业，而是妨碍了出版事业么？接着，我们开始依据苏联经验来搞计划，使整个出版事业纳入国家计划的轨道。我们还结合中国的实际情况，对私营出版业进行了社会主义改造；我们同时又拟订了一系列的制度和办法。所有这些，虽然不是没有可以改进的地方，但是归根结底说起来，我们已经在出版工作中确立了党和国家的领导权，从根本上改变了旧中国出版业的资本主义性质。只有这样，才能使出版事业成为社会主义建设的一部分。
    右派说，“你们垄断”，使人在出版方面得不到自由；我们说，党和国家领导出版事业的结果，出版事业走上计划化道路的结果，使全国人民都有最大的自由。右派分子所谓“没有自由”，只是反动的东西不能夺取市场而已。右派说，你们“大一统”束缚了思想；我们说，计划道路是我们出版界更好地服务于社会主义的方针，是传播社会主义思想的重要措施，只有反动思想才感到有点“束缚”了。
    问题已经很清楚了，右派老爷们否定学习苏联的成绩为的是什么呢？原来他们不过是借反对学习苏联来做文章，来达到他们那不可告人的目的：取消党和国家对出版事业的领导和管理。所以这是两条道路的斗争——走社会主义道路呢，还是走资本主义道路呢？这就是我们和右派分子的根本分歧。
