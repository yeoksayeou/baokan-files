Xinhua News Agency, August 14th: The rectification movement centered on the anti-Rightist struggle within the China Association for Promoting Democracy (CAPD) is gradually deepening in its local organizations.

For more than a month, a group of rightists and rightist groups have been successively exposed in various places for attacking the Communist Party and socialism from all sides. A rightist anti-Communist group has been exposed in the Guangxi provincial organization of the CAPD. This anti-Communist group, led by Hu Mingshu, Deputy Chairman of the Provincial Preparatory Committee, and Liu Mu, Secretary-General, and composed of Chen Xianzhang, Director of the Organization Department, Li Wei, Director of the Propaganda Department, and members Qin Dai and Chen Kefu, used the CAPD organization as a cover, tampered with the CAPD's organizational line, and adopted the policy of "the more the better and include everyone" to unscrupulously absorb a large number of people from Guangxi's literary and art circles and drama circles who were dissatisfied with the Communist Party into the association, turning the Guangxi CAPD into an anti-Communist base. During the rectification period, this group put forward the reactionary slogan of "If we cannot compete with the Communist Party for the country, we must also share the country with the Communist Party," attempting to bring down the Guangxi Provincial Bureau of Culture, the Guangxi Daily, and the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party, and plotting to usurp the leadership of the literary and art circles.

The rightists exposed in Changsha include Wang Guo, Secretary-General of the Municipal Preparatory Committee, and Chen Xiaochang, Deputy Chairman. Wang Guo was a key rightist element planted in the CAPD by Du Mai, a pawn of the Zhang-Luo alliance in Hunan. He adopted the policy of "uniting the backward, winning over the middle, and attacking the progressive," recruited troops everywhere, and held secret meetings in the Aiwanting Pavilion on Yue Lu Mountain to plan anti-Communist activities.

Shanghai exposed the anti-Communist activities of the CAPD branch at Caoyang Middle School. This branch, under the control of rightist Huang Junsui, had become an anti-Communist headquarters. It has now been found that Huang Junsui is also colluding with the active counter-revolutionary Chen Shunliang, plotting counter-revolutionary activities.

The Zhejiang Provincial Preparatory Committee exposed and criticized the anti-Communist and anti-socialist words and deeds of Ren Mingshan, Deputy Chairman of the Provincial Preparatory Committee and Deputy Dean of Academic Affairs of Zhejiang Normal College. Ren Mingshan vigorously clamored that the rectification must be a "storm"; and secretly organized a "Committee to Assist the Party in Rectification" in the school, using the identity of the so-called "Director of the Committee" to provoke relations between the Communist Party and intellectuals everywhere.

In Beijing, among the city's ninety-three grassroots organizations, according to statistics as of August 6, sixty-two members of thirty-four grassroots organizations have been found to have rightist words and deeds. Those identified as rightists include Shou Moqing and Li Jisheng, members of the Municipal Standing Committee; Ni Zhihuang, Zong Jiarui, and Wang Zhonghan, members of the Municipal Committee; as well as Wu Wenzao, Fu Yi, Li Mubai, Liu Qingshou, and Liu Shengshi. The rightist Shou Moqing (Deputy Director of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce Office) concentrated on attacking the national personnel system during the rectification period, slandering the personnel system as a "grievance house" of the masses, saying that "to demolish walls and fill ditches, the national personnel system must be changed." In Beijing No. 1 Girls' Middle School, the rightist Fu Yi carried out large-scale activities during the blooming and contending, attempting to usurp the Party's leadership in the school. He also wanted to organize the reactionary political party "Youth Party." The anti-Communist group composed of Liu Qingshou, Deputy Chairman of the CAPD branch, Liu Shengshi, member of the Organization Committee, and Li Mubai, member of the Propaganda Committee, also stirred up trouble everywhere in the school, confronting the Communist Party. For example, Wu Wenzao, a professor at the Central Institute for Nationalities, slandered that "the anti-rebel movement is an immoral struggle," and that "today the government's power is greater than ever before, and its ability is lower than ever before." He even agreed with Ge Peiqi's fallacy, saying that "the Communist Party may perish."

In addition, the rightists exposed in various places also include Li Shuli, Deputy Chairman of Shaanxi Province (Professor of Northwest University); Huang Pu, Standing Committee member of Wuhan (Director of the Department of Education of Central China Normal College); Cao Shaolian, member of the Wuhan Committee (Professor of Wuhan University); Chen Lang, Director of the Guangzhou Committee and Propaganda Department (Executive Committee member of the Guangzhou office of Wenhui Daily); Feng Yuming, member of the Preparatory Committee of Harbin (Lecturer at Harbin Normal College); and Wang Junyan, leader of the Preparatory Group in Zhangjiakou (Vice Chairman of the Municipal Political Consultative Conference).

However, the development of the current struggle is still uneven, and some regions are progressing slowly. This is mainly due to the right-leaning paralysis and leniency of some leaders. They believe that "the CAPD has a short history, has always leaned towards the Communist Party, has a pure team, and has few problems." Some people also have unstable positions and cannot draw a clear line with the rightists. Therefore, they are not active in the struggle, their hands and feet are soft, and their criticism is weak. The CAPD Central Rectification Leading Group has now made a decision requiring all local organizations to closely rely on the leadership and assistance of local Communist Party organizations, conscientiously overcome leniency and right-leaning paralysis, so as to further promote the in-depth development of the anti-Rightist struggle.

### 民进整风一月成绩如何？  广西揭露出一个“要和共产党争天下”的右派集团  北京、浙江、陕西等省市负责人中都发现一些右派分子

    民进整风一月成绩如何？
    广西揭露出一个“要和共产党争天下”的右派集团
    北京、浙江、陕西等省市负责人中都发现一些右派分子
    据新华社14日讯　中国民主促进会以反右派斗争为中心的整风运动，已在各地方组织中逐步深入展开。
    一个多月来，各地相继揭露出一批从各方面向共产党向社会主义进攻的右派分子和右派集团。民进广西省组织中已揭露出一个右派反共集团。这个反共集团以省筹委会副主委胡明树、秘书长刘牧为首，由组织处主任陈宪章、宣传处主任李微、会员秦黛、陈可夫等人组成。他们以民进组织作掩护，篡改民进组织路线，采取“愈多愈好和全部包下来”的方针，不择手段地吸收广西文艺界、戏剧界大批对共产党不满的人入会，把广西民进变成了反共的大本营，在整风期间，这个集团提出“不能和共产党争天下，也要和共产党分天下”的反动口号，企图搞垮广西省文化局、广西日报和中共广西省委，阴谋篡夺文艺界的领导权。
    长沙市揭发出来的右派分子有市筹委秘书长王果和副主委陈孝禅。王果是章罗联盟在湖南爪牙杜迈之指使打入民进的右派骨干分子，他以“团结落后、争取中间、打击进步”为方针，到处招兵买马，并在岳麓山爱晚亭召开秘密会议，布置反共活动。
    上海市揭露了曹杨中学支部的反共活动，这个支部在右派分子黄浚思把持下，已成为反共的司令部。现在查明黄浚思还与现行反革命分子陈顺梁有勾结，密谋进行反革命活动。
    浙江省筹委会揭露和批判了省筹委副主委、浙江师范学院副教务长右派分子任铭善的反共反社会主义言行。任铭善竭力叫喊整风必须“狂风暴雨”；并在学校暗中组织“助党整风委员会”，以所谓“主任委员”身份，到处挑拨共产党和知识分子的关系。
    在北京市全市九十三个基层组织中，根据截至8月6日为止的统计，已经发现有三十四个基层组织的六十二个会员有右派言行。确定为右派分子的有市常委寿墨卿、李纪生，市委倪之璜、宗家瑞、王钟翰以及吴文藻、傅圯、李慕白、刘庆寿、刘圣时等人。右派分子寿墨卿（全国工商联办公室副主任）在整风期间，集中攻击国家人事制度，诬蔑人事制度是群众的“怨府”，说“要拆墙填沟就得改变国家人事制度”。在北京女一中，右派分子傅圯在鸣放中大肆活动，企图篡夺学校党的领导。他还要组织反动政党“青年党”。市五中由民进支部副主委刘庆寿、组委刘圣时、宣委李慕白等组成的反共集团也在学校里到处煽风放火，和共产党分庭抗礼。又如中央民族学院教授吴文藻，诬蔑“肃反运动是不道德的斗争”，“今天政府权力之大，从古所未有，而能力之低也从古所未有。”他甚至还同意葛佩琦的谬论，说“共产党是可能亡的”。
    除此之外，各地揭露出来的右派分子还有陕西省副主委李述礼（西北大学教授），武汉市常委黄溥（华中师范学院教育系主任），委员曹绍濂（武汉大学教授），广州市委兼宣传处主任陈朗（文汇报广州办事处处务委员），哈尔滨市筹委冯玉明（哈尔滨师范学院讲师）及张家口市筹备小组长王君彦（市政协副主席）等人。
    但是，目前的斗争发展还不平衡，有些地区进展较慢。这主要由于某些领导人还有右倾麻痹思想和温情主义。他们认为“民进的历史短，一向靠拢共产党，队伍纯洁，问题不多。”也有些人立场不稳，不能与右派分子划清界限。因而在斗争中表现得不积极，手软脚软，批判无力。现在民进中央整风领导小组已作出决定，要求各地方组织应紧密依靠当地共产党组织的领导和帮助，认真克服温情主义和右倾麻痹思想，以进一步推动反右派斗争的深入开展。
