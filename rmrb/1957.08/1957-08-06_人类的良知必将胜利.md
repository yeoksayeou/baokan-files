    Humanity's Conscience Will Surely Triumph
    The Third World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament will be held in Tokyo starting on August 6th. August 6th, the ominous day twelve years ago when the first atomic bomb exploded over Hiroshima, has now become a common memorial day for the whole world. It reminds people: do not forget the catastrophe of this great destruction, do not allow the Hiroshima tragedy to be repeated! The struggle for the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction has formed a magnificent worldwide movement. The World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, initiated by the Japanese people, has received widespread support from peace-loving people around the world. This conference will have a broader representation than the previous two conferences, which is a new sign of the rapid growth of the world's forces against atomic and hydrogen bombs.
    The arms race in atomic weapons, and the continuous testing of nuclear weapons, cause people great anxiety and unease. Therefore, the call for the prohibition of the use of weapons of mass destruction, and first of all, the cessation of nuclear weapon testing, comes not only from ordinary people, authoritative scientists, social figures, and various organizations in various countries, but also from the parliaments and governments of many countries, including the Soviet Union, which itself possesses nuclear weapons. However, Western countries, especially the United States, have no sincerity in prohibiting the use and testing of nuclear weapons and reducing conventional armaments.
    At the London Disarmament Conference, the Soviet Union made several concrete and practical proposals, including the proposal to stop nuclear weapon explosion tests within two or three years first. These proposals were approved and supported by world opinion. However, the United States used delaying tactics and created extraneous issues, insisting on linking problems that could be solved independently together like chain links. For example, it insisted on linking the issue of stopping nuclear weapon testing with the issue of reducing conventional armaments, and on the issue of reducing armaments, the United States insisted that any initial agreement must be accompanied by aerial inspection, etc. As a result, the problem became greatly complicated, rendering the negotiations, which lasted for more than four months, fruitless.
    The United States' intention of not intending to stop the arms race, of not intending to abandon nuclear weapons, and of not intending to reach a disarmament agreement can also be seen from the speeches of American leaders and the atmosphere of distrust they spread regarding disarmament. U.S. President Eisenhower once said that the United States was manufacturing a "clean" hydrogen bomb. Describing a weapon of mass slaughter that not only harms living people but also will harm future generations of mankind as "clean" is, as French Atomic Energy High Commissioner Perrin said, "shocking". And U.S. Secretary of State Dulles believes that guaranteeing the abolition of such weapons of mass slaughter is "unworkable," and that merely trusting promises is also "unworkable." One of the warmongers' favorite clichés is that "nuclear power is a deterrent to war." A few days ago, Dulles continued to spread this cliché in a conversation with London radio and television audiences. These "heroes" who are keen on "deterrent power" are desperately trying to make people believe that the more nuclear weapons there are, the more guaranteed world peace will be. However, Chekhov said: If a gun is hanging on the wall in the first act of a play, then in the last act, it will always be taken down and fired. Expanding armaments can never prevent war, but only increase the danger of war, which is common sense for people with normal minds.
    Although the United States has no intention of abandoning its atomic strategy's war preparation policy, and has no intention of reaching a disarmament agreement, a noteworthy fact from the London Conference is that the United States does not dare to openly break off negotiations in defiance of world opinion. Its method is to drag the negotiations on in a half-dead, half-alive manner as much as possible. Recently, Dulles flew to London and colluded with Western countries to jointly propose a proposal regarding aerial inspection areas, which included many unreasonable and unrealistic demands, the purpose of which was to make it impossible for the other party to accept, creating endless disputes. The main reason why the United States currently does not want to truly reach an agreement and dares not openly break off negotiations is due to the pressure of world opinion. This shows that the struggle of peace-loving people around the world against atomic and hydrogen bombs has formed an undeniable force. This is also why we warmly support the convening of the Third World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament. We believe that the discussions at the conference will point out a clear direction for the people of the world, and will encourage and promote them to carry out more effective struggles against atomic and hydrogen bombs and for the realization of disarmament.
    As the initiator and host of the conference, the Japanese people have suffered three disasters in Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and the Fukuryu Maru. We express our deep sympathy for their experiences; we express our sincere respect for their heroic struggle, which has always been at the forefront of the anti-atomic and hydrogen bomb movement since the war.
    However, the attitude of the Japanese government is very different from that of the Japanese people. The Japanese government has proposed a proposal for a registration system for nuclear weapon tests at the United Nations, which in essence legalizes nuclear weapon tests. Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi even stated that Japan possessing atomic weapons does not violate the constitution. After Kishi's visit to the United States, Japan has more obviously joined the U.S. atomic strategic system. Recently, news has said that the Japanese Defense Agency is requesting six types of missiles from the United States that can launch atomic warheads. These practices of the Japanese government are clearly not in line with the strong desire of the vast Japanese people to oppose nuclear weapons and demand peace. Recently, the Japanese government also unreasonably hindered the Chinese people from sending representatives to the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs by imposing unreasonable entry conditions, and it was only after serious protests from the Chinese and Japanese people that the Chinese delegation was able to make the trip.
    Despite obstruction and sabotage, the unity of the people of the world under the clear banner of opposing atomic and hydrogen bombs and striving for disarmament will become increasingly consolidated. And this kind of "unity transcending ideology, belief, and national borders," as stated in the "Tokyo Declaration" issued by the National Conference Against Hydrogen Bomb Tests on Christmas Island on April 20, "will be a guarantee for stopping the tests and bringing peace to the world."
    We are confident that humanity's conscience will prevail, and that the forces of peace will certainly be able to defeat the adventures of the atomic militarists. We sincerely wish this conference success!

    人类的良知必将胜利
    第三届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会，从8月6日起将在东京举行。8月6日，十二年前第一颗原子弹在广岛上空炸裂的这个不祥之日，现在已成为全世界共同的纪念日。它提醒人们：不要忘记这个大毁灭的浩劫，不许广岛悲剧重演！要求禁止大规模毁灭性武器的斗争，已经形成为一个波澜壮阔的世界性运动。由日本人民发起的禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会，已得到了世界爱好和平人民的广泛支持，这一届的大会比前两届大会将有更广泛的代表参加，这就是全世界反对原子弹氢弹力量的迅速壮大的新标志。
    原子军备的竞赛，核武器的不断的爆炸试验，使人们感到巨大的忧虑和不安。因此，要求禁止使用大规模毁灭性武器，首先是停止核武器试验的呼声，已不仅来自各国的普通人民、权威的科学家、社会人士和各种团体，而且也来自许多国家的议会和政府，其中包括本身拥有核武器的苏联。但是西方国家，首先是美国，对于禁止使用和试验核武器以及裁减常规军备都是没有诚意的。
    在伦敦裁军会议上，苏联曾经几次提出具体的、切实可行的建议，包括首先在两三年内停止核武器爆炸试验的建议在内，这些建议曾得到世界舆论的赞同和支持。但是美国却以拖延搪塞，横生枝节的手段，把本来可以单独解决的问题，硬要连环扣似地一个个套了起来。例如，硬要把停止试验核武器问题同裁减常规军备问题联在一起，而在裁减军备问题上，美国又坚持任何初步协议都必须附以空中视察等等。结果，问题大大复杂化起来，使得历时四个多月的谈判一事无成。
    美国无意中止军备竞赛，无意废弃核武器，无意达成裁军协议的意图，从美国首脑人物的言论和他们散布的对于裁军的不信任气氛中也可以看得出来。美国总统艾森豪威尔曾经说，美国在制造一种“干净”的氢弹。把不仅危害活着的人们而且将危害到人类后代的大规模屠杀的武器，形容为“干净”的，这正如法国原子能高级专员贝朗所说，是“令人震惊”的。而美国国务卿杜勒斯则认为，保证废止这种大规模屠杀武器是“行不通”的，仅仅信赖诺言也是“行不通”的。好战分子最喜欢的一句口头禅是“核力量是制止大战的威慑力量”。几天以前，杜勒斯在对伦敦电台和电视听众的谈话中还继续散布这种滥调。这些热中于“威慑力量”的“英雄”们，拼命想使人们相信：核武器越多，世界和平才越有保证。然而契呵夫说过：如果一个戏的第一幕中墙上挂着枪，那末到了最后一幕，它总是要被人拿下来开火的。扩充军备绝不能防止战争，只能增加战争的危险，这是头脑正常的人们的常识。
    美国虽然无意放弃原子战略的备战政策，无意达成裁军协议，但从伦敦会议看来，一个值得注意的事实是：美国也不敢冒天下之大不韪，公然破裂谈判。它的办法是尽量使谈判不死不活地拖下去。最近杜勒斯飞到伦敦，拉拢西方国家共同提出了一个关于空中视察地区的建议，其中包括了许多既不合理、又不现实的要求，目的就是要使对方无法接受，造成无休止的争执。美国目前既不想真正达成协议，又不敢公然破裂谈判，主要是由于世界舆论的压力。这就表明，世界爱好和平人民反对原子弹氢弹的斗争已经形成为一支不可忽视的力量。这也就是为什么我们热烈支持第三届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会的召开的原因。我们相信大会的讨论，会为世界人民指出明确的方向，会鼓舞和推动他们为反对原子弹氢弹和争取实现裁军进行更有成效的斗争。
    作为大会的发起者和东道主的日本人民，曾经遭受过广岛、长崎和福龙丸的三次灾难。对于他们的遭遇，我们表示深切的同情；对于他们在战后一向站在反对原子弹氢弹运动的最前列而进行的英勇斗争，我们表示由衷的敬意。
    但是，日本政府的态度却同日本人民有很大的距离。日本政府曾在联合国提出过关于核武器试验的登记制度的建议，这实质上是使核武器试验合法化。日本首相岸信介甚至表示日本拥有原子武器也不违反宪法。岸信介访美回国之后，日本更明显地投入美国原子战略体系，最近有消息说，日本防卫厅正在向美国要求得到能够发射原子弹头的六种导弹。日本政府的这些作法，显然同日本广大人民群众的反对核武器、要求和平的强烈愿望是不相符合的。最近日本政府还对中国人民派赴禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会的代表提出无理的入境条件加以阻难，只是经过中国人民和日本人民的严重抗议，中国代表团才得以成行。
    尽管遭到阻挠和破坏，世界各国人民在反对原子弹氢弹和争取裁军的鲜明旗帜下的团结将会日益巩固。而这种“超越思想、信仰、国境的团结”，正如4月20日日本反对在圣诞岛试验氢弹的国民大会所发表的“东京宣言”所说，“将是中止试验、给世界带来和平的保证”。
    我们确信：人类的良知必将取得胜利，和平力量一定能够战胜原子黩武主义者的冒险。我们衷心预祝这届大会的成功！
