The Chengdu Municipal Committee of the China Democratic Party held an enlarged symposium for several days, sharply criticizing Zhang Mingfan and others who continued to spread poison in the anti-Rightist struggle. At the meeting, it was revealed that Zhang Mingfan openly slandered the anti-Rightist struggle, which concerns the survival of the country, as "acting," and insulted those who exposed and criticized him, saying that they "all look like secret agents and slaves." He said that the anti-Rightist struggle had become a "bomb shelter" and shelter for Communist Party members, and "Party members will become more arrogant and complacent as a result."

In a letter to Chairman Mao, Zhang Mingfan vilified the leadership of the Party as "the rule of the Party" and described ordinary Party members as "the leadership's whips and megaphones." He also openly said, "I deeply hate some Communist Party members."
