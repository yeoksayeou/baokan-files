    You can blow this vertical bamboo flute, and let the sound of the xiao linger on the river:
    Blow it so that the distant sky beats against the river water,
    Blow it so that the river water comes to the shore in a tide,
    Blow it so that the cloud dragon exhales and hangs its feet,
    The vast Yangtze River is shrouded in misty rain,
    Blow out the rainbow bridge in the sky,
    And blow it down into the turbulent Yangtze River...
    The nine-holed xiao is what we have created—
    The first bridge over the ten-thousand-mile Yangtze River.
    The xiao blows out our pride,
    Our dreams, our love...
    We don't complain about bitter rain and chilling winds,
    How much alarm there is in the frightening waves!
    The road from Jiangnan to Jiangbei passes over the sky,
    Climbing high and taking risks, like crossing a cliff,
    In winter, the steel beams are so slippery it's hard to move your feet,
    Ice and frost dye the safety belt white;
    A million rivets are a million buttons,
    Seamless heavenly clothing is cut in the air.
    The vast sky and the vast water,
    Is precisely where we work—
    The first to see the lights on both banks,
    The first to discover the white belly of the fish in the east.
    We have built a good bridge for the people,
    Who can move it from the water!
    The Yangtze River is a continuous history,
    The bridge stands tall in the turbulent depths.
    How many boats have capsized in the heart of the river,
    How many people have called for a ferry by the riverbank;
    Throwing whips cannot stop the surging torrent,
    Troubling countless talented figures throughout the ages.
    Today, the land and rivers belong to our management,
    We can freely come and go over the natural barrier;
    We praise: Such a beautiful land!
    The land and rivers praise: Such good sons and daughters!
    The song of the xiao urges us on the road,
    Crossing the Yangtze River—is just the first step.

    邵燕祥你可能吹响这管洞箫，就让箫声在江上缭绕：吹得远天拍打着江水，吹得沙岸上江水来潮，吹得那云龙嘘气挂脚，漫漫长江被烟雨笼罩，吹出了虹霓天上的桥，又把它吹落江水滔滔……九孔洞箫是我们所造——万里长江上第一座桥。洞箫吹出我们的骄傲、我们的梦想、我们的爱……苦雨凄风我们不叫苦，惊涛骇浪上多少惊骇！江南江北路从天上过，攀高、走险，就像过悬崖，冬天钢梁滑得难动脚，冰霜染白身上安全带；百万铆钉是百万纽扣，无缝天衣在空中剪裁。茫茫的长天茫茫的水，正是我们工作的所在——最早望见两岸的灯火，最早发现东方鱼肚白。我们为人民架好大桥，谁能把它从水面移开！长江是流不断的历史，大桥耸起在激流深处。江心颠覆过多少舟船，江边多少人曾经唤渡；投鞭拦不断汹涌奔流，愁煞了千古风流人物。今天江山归我们管领，天堑上任凭自由来去；我们称道：如此好江山！江山称道：如此好儿女！洞箫吹歌催我们上路，跨过长江——只是第一步。
