　　Resolutely Suppress Counter-Revolutionary Rioters
　　Twenty-Five Criminals in Hu County, Shaanxi Province, Sentenced

　　This newspaper reports: Twenty-five bandits of the "Chinese Righteous Salvation Army," who engaged in a counter-revolutionary riot in the area bordering Hu County and Zhouzhi County in Shaanxi Province, were sentenced by the Xi'an Intermediate People's Court on the 18th to death, life imprisonment, fixed-term imprisonment, and control, respectively.

　　These twenty-five criminals, during the riot, destroyed the People's Committees of Laoyu Township (not Laolue Township, as previously reported in the newspaper - this was an error) in Hu County, Shaanxi Province, and Yong'an Township in Zhouzhi County. They also robbed the local militia and the township People's Committees of firearms, stole seals, cut power lines, and wounded Zhang Shaomou, the head of Yong'an Township. In addition, they attacked a local hydrological station and robbed a supply and marketing cooperative. The bandits arrogantly plotted to overthrow our people's regime and establish a so-called "Righteous People's Government," and the circumstances were extremely heinous, seriously endangering our social order and the people's democratic cause. According to the Xi'an People's Procuratorate's prosecution of the first batch of criminals, the Xi'an Intermediate People's Court publicly sentenced the principal offender Zhang Chunyou and five others to death on the 18th, one of whom was given a two-year reprieve. Criminals such as Ruan Shiming were sentenced to life imprisonment and fixed-term imprisonment, respectively. Bandits Zhu Ankui and two others were treated leniently for surrendering themselves and were sentenced to control.

　　The ringleader of this counter-revolutionary organization, Zhang Chunyou, and others were all ex-soldiers who had consistently committed wrongdoing. Zhang Chunyou also carried blood debts and harbored extreme hatred for the Party and the People's Government. When bourgeois right-wingers were rampantly attacking the Party and socialism, they believed the time had come and became even more rampant in their counter-revolutionary activities. But in just a few days, they were severely punished by the people's law.

　　The sentencing rally was held in Hu County, attended by nearly ten thousand people. (Luo Jiangyun)

　　坚决镇压进行反革命暴乱的匪徒
　　陕西鄠县地区二十五名罪犯被判刑
    本报讯　在陕西省鄠县、盩厔交界地区进行反革命暴乱的“中国人义救命军”二十五名匪徒，18日已被西安市中级人民法院分别判处死刑、无期徒刑、有期徒刑和管制。
    这二十五名罪犯，在暴乱中捣毁了陕西省鄠县涝峪乡（不是涝略乡，过去见报的错了）和盩厔县永安乡两个乡人民委员会，并抢劫了当地民兵和乡人民委员会的枪枝，劫走了印章、砍断电线，还击伤了永安乡乡长张少谋。此外又袭击了当地的一个水文站和抢劫了一个供销社。匪徒们狂妄地阴谋推翻我人民政权，成立所谓“人义政府”，情节极为恶劣，严重地危害了我社会秩序和人民民主事业。西安市中级人民法院根据西安市人民检察院对第一批罪犯的起诉，在18日公开判处主犯张春有等六人死刑，其中一名缓期两年执行，阮仕明等罪犯分别判处无期徒刑和有期徒刑；匪徒朱安奎等三人因投案自首，得到宽大处理，被判处管制。
    这个反革命组织首犯张春有等都是兵痞出身，一贯为非作歹，张春有还身负血债，对党和人民政府极为仇恨，当资产阶级右派分子猖狂向党和社会主义进攻的时期，他们认为时机已到，便更加猖狂地进行反革命活动。但没有多少天，他们就受到人民法律的严惩。
    审判大会在鄠县城内举行，参加大会的有近万名群众。（罗江云）
