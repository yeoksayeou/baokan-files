    The "Writer" Who Was Willing to Die for Luo Longji
    Teng Hongtao's Appallingly Ugly Soul

    (Our newspaper's Lanzhou dispatch, August 9th, reporter Liu Bang) "Worker-writer" Teng Hongtao was originally a right-wing ambitious element who harbored deep-seated hatred for the Party, the people, and socialism.

    Teng Hongtao is a member of the Chinese Writers Association and the deputy leader of the production and transportation section of the Lanzhou Railway News. During the rectification campaign, he issued a comprehensive clamor attacking the socialist system. From the international communist movement to the Young Pioneers' red scarves, everything became the target of his attacks. He said that socialism was copied from the Soviet Union and "does not conform to China's national conditions." He slandered "the socialist electoral system as formalism," vilified that our country lacks "the rule of law" and only has "rule by man," advocating that "the Communist Party should be on equal footing with other democratic parties, not in a leadership relationship." He described the masses as "slaves" and Party members as "masters." He even arrogantly attempted to abolish the Party and the Communist Youth League organizations.

    He slandered the leaders of the Provincial Party Committee's cultural and educational departments as "bumpkins" who could not lead the literature and art of Gansu Province. He complained that the Party controlled the literary and artistic undertakings too much and too strictly, saying that Li Bai and Du Fu also emerged without the Party's leadership.

    Teng Hongtao distorted the Party's leadership of newspapers as "interference" and "restriction." He advocated that "the more cautious the Party Committee is about a manuscript, the more the newspaper should publish it." He denounced some of the Party Committee's instructions as "dogmatic things." So what kind of newspaper did Teng Hongtao plan to run? He bowed down to the bourgeois political direction of "Wenhui Bao" and wanted the people of "Lanzhou Railway News" to gain "inspiration" from it.

    Why did Teng Hongtao hate the Party so much? After liberation, the Party cultivated him from an ordinary railway worker into a writer, promoted him to be an editor of the Party newspaper, and gave him a high social status and honor. But as he now tentatively admits, he "is not only an extremely ungrateful worker, but also a political careerist." Because he failed to obtain a "Party member writer" label, and because he failed to become a member of the Tianjin Municipal People's Political Consultative Conference, he became dissatisfied with the Party after being transferred to Lanzhou and, in turn, wanted to rely on the China Democratic League, attempting to squeeze into the position of a member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League. So he declared that Luo Longji understood "scholars" and was his "soulmate," and that he was "willing to die for Luo Longji." Therefore, he did not hesitate to repay kindness with malice and tried every means to attack the Party. Now, comrades from the Lanzhou branch of the Xi'an Writers Association and the Lanzhou Railway Administration are jointly holding meetings to reason and struggle, peeling off the mask of this "writer" whose soul has been stained by fame and fortune.

### 甘愿为罗隆基而死的“作家”  滕鸿涛的灵魂惊人的丑恶

    甘愿为罗隆基而死的“作家”
    滕鸿涛的灵魂惊人的丑恶
    本报兰州9日电　记者柳梆报道：“工人作家”滕鸿涛原来是一个对党、对人民、对社会主义怀着刻骨仇恨的右派野心分子。
    滕鸿涛是中国作家协会会员，兰州铁道报生产运输组副组长。在整风期间，他发出全面地攻击社会主义制度的叫嚣。从国际共产主义运动到少先队的红领巾都成为他攻击的对象。他说社会主义是从苏联搬来的，“不合中国国情”。他诬蔑“社会主义选举制度是形式主义”，诋毁我国缺乏“法治”，只有“人治”，主张“共产党应该和其他民主党派划等号，不应该是领导关系”。他把群众说成是“奴隶”，他把党员说成是“主人”。他甚至狂妄地企图取消党和团的组织。
    他诽谤省委文教部门的领导是“土包子”，不能领导甘肃省的文艺。他埋怨党对文艺事业管得太多太严，说没有党的领导也出过李白和杜甫。
    滕鸿涛把党对于报纸的领导歪曲地说成是“干涉”和“限制”。他主张“越是党委要慎重考虑的稿件，报纸就越要登”。他把党委的一些指示都指责为“教条主义的东西”。那么滕鸿涛打算把报纸办成个什么样子呢？他拜倒于“文汇报”的资产阶级政治方向面前，要“兰州铁道报”的人从中得到“启发”。
    滕鸿涛为什么这样仇恨党呢？解放后，党把他从一个普通的铁路职工培养成一个作家，提拔到党报当编辑，给了他很高的社会地位和荣誉。但是正像现在他所初步承认的那样：他“不仅是个极端忘恩负义的工人，而且是个政治野心家”。他为了骗取一块“党员作家”的招牌没有捞到手，为了当天津市的政协委员没有当上，调到兰州后，就对党心怀不满，反过来想投靠民盟，企图挤上民盟中央委员的地位。于是他宣称罗隆基懂得“士”，是他的“知己”，他“愿意为罗隆基而死”。因此他不惜以怨报德，千方百计攻击党。现在西安作协兰州支组和兰州铁路管理局的同志们正联合开会说理斗争，层层剥开这个被利禄玷污了灵魂的“作家”的画皮。
