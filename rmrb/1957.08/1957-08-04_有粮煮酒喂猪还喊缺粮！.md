    Having grain to brew wine and feed pigs, yet still shouting about grain shortage!
    The Heping and Shuangjing Agricultural Production Cooperatives in Shaoyang County, Hunan, had a bumper harvest last year. During the autumn harvest distribution, each person received an average of about 500 jin of grain (excluding coarse grains). It stands to reason that this much grain should be enough to eat. However, in March of this year, some farmers requested grain supplies from the state. At that time, the cooperative chairman distributed all the more than 8,000 jin of government subsidies, but it still didn't solve the problem. What exactly is going on here?
    I think this is due to farmers making excessive demands, coupled with serious waste. For example, in April, when many people were complaining about grain shortages, there were still many people brewing wine with rice. I investigated more than ten households of poor and lower-middle peasant cooperative members, and two-thirds of them brewed wine. According to understanding, the Shuangjing Agricultural Cooperative, with more than 200 households, used at least 12,000 jin of grain for brewing wine last year. In addition, there is also a lot of use of staple grains to feed pigs.
    Judging from the above situation, the national standard for grain retention for farmers is not low. Otherwise, how could some people use rice to brew wine and feed pigs? This also shows that there is indeed a false component in the cries of insufficient grain in rural areas. Of course, last year, due to the adoption of egalitarian distribution of grain based on the number of people, some households without children or with few children did not have enough grain. This practice will be improved this year.
    An old farmer said to me, whether there is enough grain to eat depends on how you eat it. In the past, farmers always mixed in some coarse grains and ate some porridge; but what about now? They eat rice three times a day, so of course it's not enough. I think what this farmer said is right, and it's the truth.

### 有粮煮酒喂猪还喊缺粮！

    有粮煮酒喂猪还喊缺粮！
    湖南邵阳县和平和双井农业生产合作社，去年丰收，秋收分配时每人平均口粮五百斤左右（杂粮除外）。按理说，分这么多口粮是够吃的。但是今年3月却有些农民要求国家供应粮食。当时，社长把政府发下来的八千多斤补助粮全部分配了，还是不解决问题。这到底是怎么回事呢？
    我认为这是农民要求过高，同时浪费现象严重。像4月份有不少人叫缺粮的时候，可是用稻米煮酒的却大有人在，我调查了十来家中贫农社员，其中三分之二的户煮了酒。据了解，双井农业社二百多户，去年煮酒用粮至少一万二千斤。另外，用主粮喂猪的现象也很多。
    从上述情况来看，国家给农民的留粮标准是不低的，否则怎么会有人用稻谷煮酒、喂猪呢？这也说明了农村中叫嚷粮食不够吃确实有虚假成份。当然，去年由于采取了按人平均主义地分配粮食，以致造成没有小孩或小孩少的户粮食不太够吃，这种作法今年当会加以改进。
    一个老农民对我说，粮食够不够吃，决定在怎样吃法。过去农民总搭着吃些杂粮，吃点稀的；但是现在呢？一天三顿都是大米饭，这样当然就不够了。我认为这位农民说的对，也是真话。
