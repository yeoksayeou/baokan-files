    A cordial meeting was held between artists from China and India.

    (Our newspaper reports) On the morning of July 31, artists from the capital held a symposium with the great contemporary Indian artist, Mr. Uday Shankar, his wife, and the artists of the Shankar Dance Troupe.

    Yang Hansheng, member of the Presidium of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, delivered a speech first, saying, "Your artistic charm has already captivated every Chinese audience and added luster to our artistic life." He hoped that this symposium would provide an opportunity for young Chinese dancers to learn from their successful experiences. Mr. Uday Shankar and his wife answered questions about their experiences in creating dances reflecting real life on the basis of tradition, and about the overview of the development of Indian dance art over the past 30 years. At the request of the Indian friends, Chinese dancers Jia Zuoguang and Ming Na'wa performed various forms of ethnic and folk dances, such as Mongolian, Tibetan, Uyghur, Miao, and Han flower drum lanterns, and Northeast Yangko. The famous Peking Opera actor Li Shaochun also introduced some basic movements in Chinese Peking Opera classical dance to the guests. Indian dancers also gave a wonderful brief performance. The dancers of the two countries, through the common language of their respective brilliant ancient cultures, conducted a lively artistic exchange full of close feelings.

    Wu Xue, the director of the world-renowned Indian poetic drama "Shakuntala" and president of the China Youth Art Theater, also expressed at the symposium the sincere love of Chinese artists and people for excellent Indian art. Lin Lin, cultural counselor of our embassy in India, also attended the symposium.
