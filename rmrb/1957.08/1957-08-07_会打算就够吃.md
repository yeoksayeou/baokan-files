I am Tian Shujing, a member of the Ma Lizhuang Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Zhengzhou. My family consists of four people. My eldest child and I are the main laborers, and the younger child is in middle school. My family lives very well.

During the wheat season, our cooperative was a surplus grain cooperative. According to the grain distribution method based on per capita quota, my family of four received a total of 560 jin of wheat, which is enough for our family of four to eat for four months. Recently, our cooperative suffered a severe flood, and 80% of the autumn crops were flooded. It is certain that autumn grain production will decrease. Many cooperative members were afraid that the grain ration standard would be lowered after the disaster and that they would not have enough to eat. I also had this concern. Later, after the education of the cadres, I recalled the days I had lived in the past, and my worries were dispelled. Even with the grain we eat after suffering from disasters, it is more than the grain we ate in the good harvest years before liberation. At that time, the lives of us poor peasants were characterized by coarse grains and vegetables for half the year, and it was considered a good life if each person in a family could eat 200 jin of grain per year.

A jin of grain per day for a farmer is not considered much. But we cannot "forget the pain once the wound heals." Our livelihood cannot outpace production. Grain is grown by us farmers. If we don’t harvest that much in our fields, we can't just demand to eat more. The government cannot create grain, and factories cannot grow crops. Where do you expect the government to get so much grain for us?

Speaking of saving grain, we don't have any new tricks, but we should be more careful in our daily lives. Pay attention to saving grain in every meal and avoid leftovers. Eat some substitutes in all seasons. This not only saves grain and money but also improves and adjusts our lives, which is beneficial to both the country and ourselves. At the same time, we must overcome the mentality of relying on the state. Some farmers have an incorrect idea after the implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain: anyway, the People's Government will not let people starve to death, and if there is not enough grain, we can ask the government for it. They open the back door in their minds, and as a result, they do not pay attention to saving. I don't think so. I believe that the state provides no small amount of grain to us disaster victims, and we cannot ask the state to provide more. We should think of more ways to ensure that we have enough grain to eat. With the ideological problem solved, it is easier to find ways to overcome practical problems. I plan my monthly grain consumption carefully, so my grain for the previous year was sufficient and I did not ask the state to supply additional grain. In addition, we must establish the idea of "preventing poor harvests every year." For example, although we had a good harvest this summer, and each member of my family received more than one jin of grain, I still did not relax on saving, never overeating or drinking excessively, and saved grain for consumption in case of autumn disasters.

    会打算就够吃
    我是郑州市郊区马李庄农业社社员，名叫田书景，全家四口人，大孩子和我是主要劳动力，小孩子在中学念书。一家人生活过的很好。
    麦季我们社是个余粮社，按照以人定量的口粮分配办法，我家四口人，共分小麦五百六十斤，足够我们四口人四个月的食用。最近，我社遭受了严重的水灾，秋庄稼淹了80％，秋季粮食减产是肯定了。不少社员怕受灾后，吃粮标准低了，不够吃，我也有这种想法。后来经过干部的教育，回想过去所过的日子，顾虑解除了。现在就是遭了灾荒所吃的粮食，也比解放以前丰收年吃的粮食多。那时间，我们穷苦农民的生活是终年糠菜半年粮，一家平均每口人每年能吃二百斤粮食就是好生活了。
    农民一天一斤粮食是不算多的。但是我们不能“好了疮疤忘了痛”。生活不能跑在生产前面。粮食是咱农民种的，咱地里没有收那些，咱非要吃的多，政府也不会造粮食，工厂也不会长庄稼，你叫政府往那给咱弄来这么多的粮食。
    说起来节约粮食，咱也没有什么更多新的窍门，不过平常过日子仔细点，顿顿饭注意节约粮食，不要有剩饭现象，四季要吃一些代食品。这样不光节约了粮食和钱，而且也改善调剂了生活，对国家对自己都有好处。同时要克服依赖国家思想。有些农民在粮食实行统购统销后有一种不正确的思想：反正人民政府不让饿死人，粮食不够吃找政府要。自己思想上开了后门，结果就不注意节约。我就不这么想，我认为国家供应咱灾民粮食就不少，不能要求国家再多供应，自己应该多想办法保证粮食够吃。思想问题解决，实际问题也就容易想办法克服，每月的粮食我都计划着吃，所以上一年度我的粮食够吃够用，没有要求国家再补销粮食。此外，还要树立“年年防歉”思想，例如今年夏季虽然丰收了，我家每人分的粮食超过一斤，但我仍没有放松节约，从不大吃大喝，节省下来粮食，以备秋季遭灾食用。
