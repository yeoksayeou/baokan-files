　　Strengthening Party Leadership, Overcoming Rightist Thinking
　　Jilin's Anti-Rightist Struggle Line Gradually Expands
　　(Our report) The anti-Rightist struggle in Jilin Province is gradually expanding its front. The anti-Rightist struggle in Changchun and Jilin cities has extended to all walks of life. Anti-Rightist struggles have also been universally launched in Siping, Liaoyuan, Tonghua, Yanji, and Gongzhuling.

　　In Changchun City, Rightist elements such as Yang Qing, Yu Ruihuang, Liu Zongxiang, Xu Xianyi, and Xu Naizuo were all heads of anti-Party cliques. Under the pursuit and condemnation of the masses, they began to surrender and confess their crimes of attempting to seize leadership positions in universities. The four anti-Party cliques exposed in Jilin City have disintegrated, revealing their reactionary nature. Gongzhuling City broke up a reactionary clique within the joint medical institutions. These Rightist cliques had been everywhere – in universities, joint state-private enterprises, medical and health departments, state-owned factories, and government agencies – colluding with those dissatisfied with the Party, gathering bourgeois Rightists and historical reactionaries, and launching planned and programmatic attacks against the Party to seize leadership positions. Workers at the Optics and Precision Machinery Instrument Factory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have been holding meetings for days, struggling against Chen Weitai, a backbone Rightist element in the factory.

　　Many units that had previously struggled weakly began to overcome their tendencies toward leniency and Rightist thinking, and also exposed many hidden Rightist elements. Although these Rightist elements did not publicly express reactionary opinions during the period of great airing of views, they spread absurd opinions and engaged in reactionary activities behind the scenes. Because the masses were fully mobilized and their political acumen was improved, the reactionary faces of these Rightist elements were identified. The notion that there were no Rightists in small and medium-sized cities also proved untenable. Tonghua City, a small city, alone exposed more than twenty Rightist elements. More than one hundred Rightist elements mixed in with the Party and Communist Youth League ranks throughout the province have been exposed. Rightist elements within the Party, such as Xu Lizhi, Liang Zhizheng, and Han Shen, openly betrayed the Party, echoed the Rightist elements outside the Party, and degenerated into agents of the bourgeois Rightists within the Party.

　　Recently, the anti-Rightist struggle in the literary and art circles and scientific and technological circles throughout the province has also been launched. In the past, the Party's work on these two fronts was relatively weak, and the anti-Rightist struggle was not resolute and forceful enough. Due to the strengthening of Party leadership and the criticism of more serious Rightist thinking, initial achievements have now been made. The CPC Gongzhuling Prefectural Committee dispatched a group of cadres to help the Agricultural Science Research Institute launch a comprehensive struggle and repelled the reactionary attacks of Rightist elements such as Zhao Baozhang. The Secretary of the CPC Jilin Provincial Committee and the Secretary of the CPC Changchun Municipal Committee personally went to the Changchun Film Studio to help the Film Studio Party Committee reverse its Rightist thinking, expose the anti-Party activities of Rightist elements within the Party, such as comedy director Lü Ban, and break up the anti-Party presidium of the Changchun Film Studio Orchestra, which had once usurped the leadership of the rectification movement, thereby advancing the anti-Rightist struggle of the Changchun Film Studio to a deeper stage. Under the direct leadership and assistance of the CPC Jilin Provincial Committee, the Changchun Branch of the Chinese Writers Association also exposed the reactionary words and deeds of Rightist elements such as Jiang Xijin, Wang Ken, and Ding Ye.

　　At present, the anti-Rightist struggle throughout the province is not deep or widespread enough. Some departments, such as the political and legal departments and a few Party and government organs, have not seriously mobilized the masses to resolutely launch the anti-Rightist struggle. The Party leaders of these departments are busy with routine administrative work, pay little attention to political issues, regard the anti-Rightist struggle as an unimportant matter, and have not deeply understood that this is a political and ideological revolutionary movement related to the survival of the socialist cause. Some units that have already launched the anti-Rightist struggle have not worked deeply and meticulously enough, their enthusiasm is beginning to slacken, and they are attempting to hastily conclude the struggle. The CPC Jilin Provincial Committee recently held a meeting, criticized the shortcomings of these departments, and demanded that all cities, departments, and industries throughout the province earnestly examine the situation of the anti-Rightist struggle in the previous stage, overcome leniency, prevent a simple and hasty style of work, and resolutely carry the anti-Rightist struggle through to the end.

### 加强党的领导　克服右倾思想　吉林反右派斗争战线逐步扩大

　  加强党的领导　克服右倾思想
　　吉林反右派斗争战线逐步扩大
    本报讯　吉林省反右派斗争的战线逐步扩大。长春、吉林两市反右派斗争已扩展到各行各业。四平、辽源、通化、延吉和公主岭等地都普遍展开反右派斗争。
    长春市右派分子杨清、俞瑞潢、刘宗向、徐贤仪和徐乃祚等都是反共小集团的头子。他们在群众的追击和痛斥之下开始投降认罪，初步交代出他们图谋夺取高等学校领导权的罪行。吉林市揭露出的四个反共小集团，已经四分五裂，显出反动原形。公主岭市在联合医疗机构中攻破了一个反动小集团。这些右派小集团曾经在高等学校、公私合营企业、医疗卫生部门、国营工厂和政府机关中，到处拉拢对党不满的分子，搜罗资产阶级右派分子和历史上的反动分子，有计划有纲领地向党进攻，争夺领导地位。中国科学院光学精密机械仪器厂职工连日举行会议，向厂内右派骨干分子陈维太进行斗争。
    许多过去斗争无力的单位，开始克服温情主义和右倾思想，也揭露出不少隐藏的右派分子。这些右派分子虽然在大鸣大放期间没有公开发表反动言论，但是却在背后散播荒谬言论，进行反动活动。由于充分发动群众，提高了群众政治嗅觉，这些右派分子的反动面貌就都被群众识别出来。曾经认为中小城市无右派的说法也站不住脚了。光是通化市这样一个小城市，就揭发出二十多名右派分子。混在全省党、团队伍中的右派分子，已被揭露出一百多名。像党内右派分子徐利治、梁致政、韩申等都公然背叛党，和党外右派分子遥相呼应，堕落成为资产阶级右派分子在党内的代理人。
    最近全省文艺界、科学技术界的反右派斗争也展开了。过去这两条战线的党的工作比较薄弱，反右派斗争不够坚决有力。由于加强了党的领导，批判了较严重的右倾思想，现在也获得初步成绩。中共公主岭地委派出一批干部，帮助农业科学研究所全面展开斗争，击退了右派分子赵保障等人的反动进攻。中共吉林省委书记和中共长春市委书记都亲自到长春电影制片厂去，帮助长影党委扭转右倾思想，揭发出党内右派分子、喜剧导演吕班等人的反党活动，并且攻破了一度篡夺整风领导权的反党的长影乐团的主席团，从而把长影的反右派斗争推进到深入的阶段。中国作家协会长春分会也在中共吉林省委的直接领导和帮助下，揭发出右派分子蒋锡金、王肯、丁耶等人的反动言行。
    目前全省反右派斗争还不够深入、广泛。有些部门，像政法部门和少数党政机关，还没有认真发动群众坚决展开反右派斗争。这些部门的党的领导人员忙于日常事务工作，不大注意政治问题，把反右派斗争看成是无关紧要的事情，没有深刻理解这是一场关系社会主义事业存亡的政治上思想上的革命运动。部分已经展开反右派斗争的单位，工作不够深入细致，情绪开始松懈，企图草率收兵。中共吉林省委最近开会，批评了这些部门的缺点，要求全省各城市、各部门、各行各业，都要认真检查前一阶段反右派斗争的情况，克服温情主义，防止简单草率作风，坚决地把反右派斗争进行到底。
