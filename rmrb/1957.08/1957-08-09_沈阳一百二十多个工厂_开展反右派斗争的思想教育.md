Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 7th - More than 120 factories in Shenyang are carrying out in-depth ideological education in the anti-Rightist struggle.

Every evening, thousands of workers gather in the clubs of many factories in Shenyang to listen to special reports. In the Tiexi district, where factories are concentrated, more than 30 factories have already held special report meetings. The heads of the Chinese Communist Party organizations and administrative departments of each factory, as well as reporters from various departments, reported to the workers on the leadership of the Communist Party, the achievements of socialist construction and transformation, and issues such as democracy and centralism, and freedom and discipline. Six factories, including the Shenyang Chemical Plant, also invited directors of agricultural production cooperatives in the nearby suburbs to report on the achievements of agricultural collectivization during the slack farming season.

Currently, whether in the early morning or evening, groups of workers are gathered under the trees and beside the workshops in various factories. Some are discussing, some are reading newspapers, and some are studying and writing articles to counter the fallacies of the bourgeois rightists. Factory newspapers, blackboard newspapers, and radio stations publish and broadcast articles written by the workers, who use their own experiences to refute the fallacies of the bourgeois rightists among the technical staff of their factories.

In the socialist ideological education, veteran workers and demobilized construction soldiers in various factories have automatically formed a backbone force. They formed lecturer groups and used the method of comparing the old and the new to tell young workers about the suffering and struggles they had experienced. Yang Wenpu and four other veteran workers from the Northeast Pharmaceutical General Factory, disregarding their fatigue after work every day, went to various branches and workshops to report. The young workers who heard their reports said that they received a strong class education from the life experiences of the veteran workers. Veteran workers and demobilized construction soldiers also presided over various workers' forums and newspaper reading groups, and patiently and meticulously persuaded and educated workers with weak class consciousness and lax labor discipline.

At present, the socialist ideological education being carried out in various factories in Shenyang is trending towards in-depth development. Units such as the Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory, the Northeast Pharmaceutical General Factory, and the Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Factory, combined with the lax labor discipline and other problems existing among their employees, are using criticism and self-criticism to conduct labor discipline education, in order to further improve the political and ideological awareness of the broad masses of workers.

The in-depth and systematic anti-Rightist struggle education for workers in various factories in Shenyang began in early July. Before this, when the bourgeois rightists launched attacks on the Communist Party and socialism, workers in more than 70 factories in Shenyang gathered and pledged to defend socialism.

    沈阳一百二十多个工厂
    开展反右派斗争的思想教育
    新华社沈阳7日电　沈阳一百二十多个工厂深入开展反右派斗争的思想教育。
    每天傍晚，沈阳很多工厂的俱乐部里，聚集着上千名工人在听取专题报告。在工厂集中的铁西区，有三十多个工厂已经举办了专题报告会，各厂中共党组织和行政方面的负责人，以及来自各个部门的报告员，向工人报告了关于共产党的领导、社会主义建设和改造事业的成就，以及民主和集中、自由和纪律等问题。沈阳化工厂等六个工厂，还邀请近郊农业生产合作社主任利用农闲时间，进城报告农业合作化的成就。
    目前，不论清晨或傍晚，在各个工厂的树荫下、车间旁，都围拢着一群群工人。他们有的讨论，有的读报，有的正在研究撰写反击资产阶级右派分子的文章。工厂里的厂报、黑板报、广播站都刊载和广播着工人们写的文章，他们用亲身经历，驳斥本厂技职人员中资产阶级右派分子的谬论。
    各个工厂里的老工人和复员建设军人，在社会主义思想教育中，自动形成了一支骨干力量。他们组成讲师团把自己经历的苦难和斗争，用新旧对比的方式讲给青年工人。东北制药总厂杨文浦等五名老工人，每天下班以后，不顾疲劳，分别到各个分厂和车间去报告，听到他们报告的青年工人，都说从老工人的生活经历里受到了强烈的阶级教育。老工人和复员建设军人还主持了各种工人座谈会和读报组，并且对阶级观念薄弱、劳动纪律松弛的工人，进行了耐心细致的说服教育。
    现在，沈阳各个工厂开展的社会主义思想教育，正趋向深入发展。沈阳高压开关厂、东北制药总厂、沈阳第二机床厂等单位，结合本厂职工存在的劳动纪律松弛等情况，采用批评和自我批评的方式，进行着劳动纪律教育，以进一步提高广大工人的政治思想觉悟。
    沈阳各工厂这次对工人进行深入系统的反右派斗争教育，是在7月上旬开始的。在这以前，沈阳七十多个工厂的工人在资产阶级右派分子向共产党和社会主义发动攻击的时候，曾纷纷集会，誓师保卫社会主义。
