Editorial Note: The following is an investigation by the Industrial Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China regarding the massive requisition of farmland in basic construction. This investigation shows that the waste of land in current basic construction is quite serious. If it is not corrected quickly, it will not only cause great economic losses to the country, but also lead to unfavorable consequences in the relationship between the state and farmers. It is hoped that all relevant departments and local party committees will conduct a rapid inspection, return the land over-occupied and unoccupied by construction units to the farmers for cultivation immediately, and investigate and deal with any violations of law and discipline in land requisition, and hold those responsible accountable. It is hoped that the State Construction Commission, in conjunction with relevant departments, will re-examine the land quotas for industrial and mining enterprises, schools, and other construction projects, and re-examine and revise the draft urban plans; before the new urban plan is finalized, if certain construction units urgently need land, they should be allocated as much as possible from the existing vacant construction land.

In order to develop industrial construction, it is necessary and reasonable to requisition a portion of farmland. However, many construction units exhibit neglect of agricultural production and the lives of farmers when determining land use:

    I. "Requisitioning more than using" and "requisitioning early and using late." Twenty-two construction units in Taiyuan City requisitioned 10,214 mu of land, of which 5,098 mu were left barren, including 1,257 mu that had been barren for three years. In Chengdu City, 5,900 mu of railway land was left barren. When selecting a site for the Southwest Heavy Machinery Plant, it was proposed to use 10,500 mu of land, while in fact only 3,800 mu to 4,300 mu were needed. According to incomplete statistics from Chengdu, Wuhan, Changsha, Beijing, Hangzhou, and Hebei Province, over the past few years, construction requisitioned 100,000 mu of land, of which about 40,000 mu was wasted. Dagu Mountain Mine in Liaoning Province proposed to requisition 5,000 mu of land at once, according to a 25-year long-term plan. Xuanhua Longyan Iron Mine requisitioned 2,400 mu of land prematurely, and has been leasing it to farmers for cultivation for four or five years.

    II. Land requisitioned in excess due to unapproved or reduced plans is left barren for a long time. In Xi'an City, 399 construction units requisitioned 63,320 mu of land, originally planning to build 809,400 square meters of floor space. Later, the construction plan was reduced by 41.3%, but the requisitioned land was not reduced accordingly, resulting in a great waste. Fifteen units, including the State Material Reserve Bureau and a certain military medical university, wasted 1,337 mu of land alone. Nine units, including Wuhan Heavy Machinery Plant, wasted 963 mu of land due to changes in plans. In 1955, Qingdao City recovered 1,116 mu of land that had been allocated but not used.

    III. Some construction units overemphasize their special needs and requisition too much land. For example, a certain military chemical plant has a factory area of only one square kilometer, but the surrounding isolation zone is 5.7 square kilometers. The Hunan Ceramic Research Institute, on the pretext of having many senior intellectuals, insisted on requisitioning 20 mu of farmers' orange orchards and hired workers to manage them, causing great resentment among the farmers. Some units do not pay compensation fees to farmers for requisitioned land and houses, which has a very bad political impact. For example, the Aksu Department Store in the Uyghur Autonomous Region requisitioned 40 mu of land, and not only did not pay compensation fees for the fruit trees in the land, but also said, "We only use the land, not the trees."

    IV. The selection of factory sites lacks a comprehensive perspective, resulting in the requisition of too much fertile land. Some construction units only consider that placing the factory on flat ground can reduce earthwork and lower project costs, but do not consider that requisitioning too much fertile land will affect agricultural production and the lives of farmers. According to comrades from the Ministry of Urban Construction, Hanzhong City, on the north bank of the Han River in Shaanxi, has 450,000 mu of fertile land, with an annual grain yield of 850 jin per mu. The initially planned second five-year plan was to place more than 20 factories in this area, which would requisition more than 220,000 mu of fertile land, almost half of the fertile land in the suburbs. Soviet expert Belikov, when selecting a site for a power plant in Jintang, Sichuan, had to occupy "thousand-jin mu" farmland because the surrounding factory sites had already been determined. The expert said painfully: "I have been working on factory site selection for more than 20 years, and I have never chosen high-yield farmland as a factory site. This is a stain on my history."

    V. Improper resettlement of farmers affects their income and lives. The newly built yarn factory in Handan City, on the pretext that farmers have low cultural levels and do not understand technology, refused to recruit young farmers from the requisitioned land to work in the yarn factory, but recruited a large number of workers from Baoding, Xingtai, and other cities.

    VI. Lack of comprehensive arrangements for industrial and agricultural water use affects agricultural production and farmers' drinking water. After the newly built textile factory in Baqiao District of Xi'an City adopted underground water supply, 113 of the existing 149 soil wells used by farmers for drinking water could not supply water normally, and 6 of the 51 agricultural irrigation wells were also affected. In the Beichuan Industrial Zone of Xining City, the minimum flow of the Beichuan River is 4 cubic meters per second. Before 1964, the industrial water consumption reached 3.5 cubic meters per second. Adding agricultural water consumption, the Beichuan River cannot supply enough water, which will be a major problem.

Due to the occurrence of the above-mentioned contradictions, some farmers have expressed dissatisfaction. Some said: "The government asks us to produce more grain to support industrial construction, but leaves a large amount of land barren, which is really heartbreaking." In order to correct the above-mentioned waste of land, according to the spirit of the State Council's instructions on the method of land requisition for national construction in December 1953, the following suggestions are made:

    I. Relevant government departments should conduct a serious inspection of the land use of various enterprises, schools, and other buildings, and conduct ideological education on the worker-peasant alliance for relevant personnel, and earnestly overcome the one-sided thinking of only considering economic, cultural, and military construction and neglecting agricultural production and the lives of farmers. It is required that all construction units further implement the central government's instructions on saving land, not requisitioning land too early if construction is not to be carried out temporarily, and making full use of available wasteland and open space, and using less or no land in densely populated areas and fertile land.

    II. When organizing factory site selection, the State Construction Commission should consider occupying less fertile farmland as much as possible, and in view of the specific situation that China's arable land area is smaller than that of the Soviet Union, it should, in conjunction with relevant departments, re-formulate land quotas for urban planning, factories, schools, etc., as the legal basis for land requisition. It is recommended that the Ministry of Water Resources, in conjunction with the Ministry of Urban Construction, make comprehensive plans for industrial and agricultural water use in new industrial cities and gradually solve the problem uniformly.

    III. The people's committees of various provinces and cities should strengthen their leadership over land requisition work, strictly supervise the land purchase work of land-using units, and resolutely correct the irresponsible style of some local competent departments in allocating land, "giving as much as is asked for, and giving wherever is asked for." We must promote the method of careful calculation adopted in some places. For example, when Liangxiang, Hebei, assisted the troops in requisitioning land, after repeated surveys of the terrain and careful calculations, the area saved was more than 400 mu compared with the area applied for by the troops. At the same time, in order to overcome the phenomenon of wasting arable land, party committees at all levels should organize land-using units to conduct a comprehensive inspection of land purchase and use, and the land that is not currently used should be recovered and handed over to farmers for cultivation as much as possible; for the masses who have been improperly resettled after the requisition of land, they should be resettled properly; illegal and disciplinary acts such as delaying or failing to pay compensation fees for land, houses, etc., should be corrected immediately to compensate farmers for their losses.

    节约基本建设用地！
    编者按　这里发表的是中共中央工业工作部关于基本建设中大量征用农田的一个调查。这个调查说明，目前基本建设中浪费土地的情况是相当严重的。如果不很快地加以纠正，不仅会使国家在经济上遭受很大的损失，而且会引起国家同农民关系上的不利后果。希望各有关部门和各地党委迅速作一次检查，把建设单位多占的和占而不用的土地，立即退还给农民耕种；对于在征用土地中的违法乱纪的行为，查明责任，严肃处理。希望国家建设委员会会同各有关部门，重新研究工矿企业、学校及其他建筑用地的定额，重新审查和修改各城市的规划草案；在新的城市规划未定之前，某些建设单位如急需用地，应尽可能地在现有的建筑空地中拨给。
    为了工业建设的发展，征用一部分农田，是必要的和合理的。但是，有许多建设单位在确定用地的时候，却存在着忽视农业生产和农民生活的现象：
    一、“征多用少”和“早征晚用”。太原市二十二个建设单位征用土地一万零二百一十四亩，荒芜五千零九十八亩，其中荒芜三年之久的有一千二百五十七亩。成都市荒芜铁路用地五千九百亩。西南重机厂选厂时，提出要一万零五百亩用地，而实际上只需要三千八百亩到四千三百亩。据成都、武汉、长沙、北京、杭州和河北等五市一省的不完全统计，几年来因建设而征用的土地达十万亩，其中浪费约四万多亩。辽宁省大孤山矿，提出要按照二十五年远景计划一次征用土地五千亩。宣化龙烟铁矿过早征用土地二千四百亩，四、五年来一直出租给农民耕种。
    二、因计划批不准或计划削减而多征用的土地，任其长期荒芜。西安市三百九十九个建设单位征用土地六万三千三百二十亩，原计划建筑面积八十万九千四百平方公尺，以后建筑计划削减41.3％，而征用的土地没有相应削减，以致浪费很大，仅国家物质储备局、某军医大学等十五个单位，就浪费土地达一千三百三十七亩。武汉重型工具厂等九个单位，因计划变更而浪费了土地九百六十三亩。青岛市1955年收回了已经划拨而未使用的土地达一千一百一十六亩。
    三、有些建设单位过分强调特殊，过多征用土地。例如某军用化工厂，厂区面积仅一平方公里，周围的隔离地带就要五点七平方公里。湖南陶瓷研究所，借口高级知识分子多，坚持征用农民二十亩橘园，雇工经营，引起农民很大的反感。有些单位不发给农民被征用土地和房屋的补偿费，政治影响很坏。如维吾尔自治区阿克苏百货公司，征用土地四十亩，地中的果树不但不给补偿费，反说“我们用地不用树”。
    四、选择厂址时缺乏全面观点，过多征用良田。有些建设单位，只考虑到把工厂摆在平地可以减少土方工程量，降低工程造价，却没有考虑到征用良田太多会影响农业生产和农民生活。据城市建设部同志反映，陕西汉江北岸的汉中市郊有良田四十五万亩，每亩年产粮食八百五十斤，最初拟定的第二个五年计划准备在该地区放二十多个工厂，将要征用良田二十二万多亩，几乎占用市郊良田一半。苏联专家贝利可夫在四川金堂选择电厂厂址，由于周围厂址已定，不得不占用“千斤亩”的农田，该专家很痛心地说：“我干了二十多年的选厂工作，从来没有选择高产额农田作厂址，这一次是我历史上的一个污点。”
    五、对农民安置不当，影响农民的收入和生活。邯郸市的新建纱厂，借口农民文化低，不懂技术，拒绝吸收被征用土地的青年农民进纱厂做工，而去保定、邢台等城市大量招收工人。
    六、对工农业用水缺乏全面安排，影响农业生产和农民生活用水。西安市坝桥区新建纺织工厂采用地下供水以后，农民现有一百四十九个生活用水的土井已有一百一十三个不能正常供水，五十一个农业灌溉井也有六个受影响。西宁市北川工业区，北川河最小的流量四秒公方，在1964年以前，工业用水量达三点五秒公方，加上农业用水量，北川河无法供给，将是一个大问题。
    由于发生以上这些矛盾的情况，已引起一些农民的不满。有的说：“政府要我们多打粮食，支援工业建设，却把大量的土地荒芜，真是痛心。”为了纠正上述浪费土地的现象，根据1953年12月政务院关于国家建设征用土地办法的指示的精神，特提出以下几点建议：
    一、政府有关部门应当对各企业、学校及其他建筑用地情况，认真地进行一次检查，并对有关人员进行工农联盟的思想教育，切实地克服只顾经济、文化和军事建设，忽视农业生产和农民生活的片面思想。要求各建设单位进一步贯彻中央关于节约用地的指示，暂时不施工的不要过早征用，尽量利用可资利用的荒地和空地，少用或不用人烟稠密地区的土地和良田。
    二、国家建设委员会在组织厂址选择时，应当尽可能考虑少占用肥沃的农田，并且根据我国可耕土地面积较苏联狭小的具体情况，会同有关部门，重新制定城市规划、工厂、学校等用地定额，作为征用土地的法定依据。建议水利部会同城市建设部对新工业城市工、农业用水问题，作出全面规划，逐步统一解决。
    三、各省市人民委员会应加强对土地征用工作的领导，严格监督用地单位的征购土地工作，坚决纠正有些地方主管部门在划拨土地工作上“要多少给多少，要那里给那里”的不负责任的作风。要提倡有些地方所采取的精打细算的办法，例如：河北良乡在协助部队征用土地时，经过反复勘察地形，仔细核算，结果比部队申请的用地面积节省了四百多亩。同时，为了克服浪费耕地现象，各地党委应该组织用地单位对土地征购和使用情况作一次通盘检查，对于目前不用的土地，应当尽可能收回交给农民耕种；对于被征用土地后安置不当的群众，应当重新妥善安置；对于拖延未发和不发土地、房屋等补偿费等违法乱纪行为，应当立即加以纠正，补偿农民损失。
