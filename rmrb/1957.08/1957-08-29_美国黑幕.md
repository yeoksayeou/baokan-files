American Black Curtain

    Racial Discrimination at the University of Mississippi
    The American "Delta Democrat-Times" recently reported that many professors at the University of Mississippi have resigned because they could not stand the "interference" of racists. According to Mississippi state law, professors here must sign an oath listing the names of institutions they have participated in and donated to in the past. Professors who support black and white students attending the same schools have been searched, persecuted, and attacked. Some state legislators have even demanded that the university library not keep any books about black people.
    Many students have become spies, blacklisting people suspected of opposing racial discrimination, and constantly informing the state legislature's extreme racists of their activities.
    Knowledge of University Students
    An Associated Press dispatch said that four hundred students from the most famous universities in the eastern United States recently took a common sense test. The results showed that only thirty-seven could name the four major Indian cities of Bombay, Calcutta, Delhi, and Madras; only seventy-six knew that India gained its independence in 1947.
    Child Kills Father
    Ten-year-old Amort of Minnesota recently shot and killed his father. He remained calm in the police station and said that his father often kicked and beat him and his brothers, and he therefore held a grudge and decided to kill him. On this day, he had the opportunity to follow his father to a forest and shot him in the back with a rifle.

    美国黑幕
    种族歧视在密士失必大学
    美国“三角洲民主时报”最近报道，密士失必大学许多教授因为受不了种族主义者的“干扰”而辞去职务。根据密士失必州的法律，这里的教授们一律要签署一种誓约，列举他们过去参加过和捐助过的机构的名称。凡是拥护黑人和白人同校的教授们都遭到搜查、迫害和攻击。有些州议员甚至要求大学的图书馆不得存放任何有关黑人的书籍。
    许多学生成为特务，把一些有反对种族歧视嫌疑的人列入黑名单，并且，随时把他们的活动通知州议会的极端种族主义者们。
    大学生的知识
    美联社的一条消息说，四百名美国东部最著名的大学学生最近接受了一次常识测验。结果只有三十七人能说出印度四个大城市孟买、加尔各答、德里和马德拉斯的名字；只有七十六人知道印度是在1947年独立的。
    儿童杀父
    美国明尼苏达州一个年纪十岁的儿童阿莫特最近开枪打死了自己的父亲。他在警察局中还泰然自若地说，他的父亲时常踢打他和他的兄弟们，他因此怀恨在心，决意杀死他。这天有了机会，他跟踪他的父亲来到一个树林里，用步枪从背后打死了他的父亲。
