Zhengzhou No. 2 Junior High School pays great attention to cultivating students' love of labor. The school has not only opened up a botanical garden of about twelve mu in the schoolyard, specializing in planting crops such as soybeans and corn, but also organizes students to participate in agricultural production in nearby agricultural production cooperatives during holidays. Many students also use their spare time to help their families with production. (Attached pictures)

    郑州市第二初中注意培养学生劳动习惯
    郑州市第二初级中学很注意培养学生热爱劳动的习惯。这个学校不但在校院里开辟了约十二亩大的植物园，专门种植大豆、玉米等农作物，而且还组织学生在假日里去附近农业生产合作社参加农业生产。许多学生还利用课余时间帮助家人从事生产。（附图片）
