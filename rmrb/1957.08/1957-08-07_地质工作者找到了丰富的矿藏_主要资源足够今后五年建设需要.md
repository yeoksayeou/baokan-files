Xinhua News Agency, 6th Dispatch: A Xinhua News Agency reporter learned today from the Ministry of Geology that, following large-scale geological exploration work during the First Five-Year Plan, the proven reserves of minerals such as iron, manganese, coal, copper, lead-zinc, magnesium, molybdenum, tin, tungsten, and phosphorus in our country can basically meet the needs of newly built and renovated large-scale enterprises during the Second Five-Year Plan.

    In terms of iron ore, from 1953 to the end of this year, it is estimated that proven reserves will reach more than 4 billion tons, which can meet the needs of large-scale iron and steel enterprises such as Anshan Iron and Steel, Benxi Iron and Steel, Baotou Iron and Steel, Wuhan Iron and Steel, as well as those in the Southwest and Northwest, for fifty years. Coal, manganese, copper, lead-zinc, magnesium, tin, tungsten, phosphorus and other minerals can basically meet the needs of building large enterprises during the Second Five-Year Plan. Some minerals, such as molybdenum, have already greatly exceeded the construction needs of the Second Five-Year Plan.

    Exploration in recent years has proven that the reserves of the above-mentioned minerals in our country are very rich. Among them, the proven reserves of tungsten, tin, molybdenum and other minerals rank first in the world. The proven reserves of other minerals such as iron, phosphorus, and copper can also be compared with those of other major countries in the world.

    Another dispatch: The National Planning Conference of the Ministry of Geology, which closed yesterday, formulated the 1958 geological survey and exploration plan based on the preliminary long-term geological work plan and the central government's policy of combining large, medium, and small enterprises in enterprise construction. It requires the geological bureaus (offices) of each province (autonomous region) in 1958 to conduct a comprehensive survey of the mineral resources needed by central and local enterprises as well as foreign trade, and make unified plans and overall arrangements. According to this plan, in 1958, in addition to continuing to survey and explore the resources needed by certain large enterprises, the Ministry of Geology system will also greatly strengthen the survey and exploration of the resources needed by medium and small enterprises.

    地质工作者找到了丰富的矿藏
    主要资源足够今后五年建设需要
    据新华社6日讯　新华社记者今天从地质部获悉：经过第一个五年计划大规模的地质勘探工作，我国已经探明的铁、锰、煤、铜、铅锌、镁、钼、锡、钨、磷等矿产的储量，已经基本上可以满足第二个五年计划新建改建大型企业的需要。
    铁矿方面，从1953年到今年年底止，预计可以探明储量四十几亿吨，可以满足鞍钢、本溪、包头、武汉，以及西南、西北等大型钢铁企业五十年的需要；煤、锰、铜、铅锌、镁、锡、钨、磷等矿产，都可以基本上满足第二个五年计划建设大型企业的需要。有的矿产如钼等，已经大大超过了第二个五年计划建设的需要。
    几年来的勘探证明，以上各种矿产在我国的蕴藏量是十分丰富的。其中钨、锡、钼等矿产已经探明的储量，都占世界第一位，其他如铁、磷、铜等矿产已探明的储量，也可以同世界上其他主要国家相媲美。
    又讯　昨天闭幕的地质部全国计划会议根据地质工作远景初步规划和中央关于企业建设大中小型相结合的方针，拟订了1958年地质普查勘探计划，要求各省（自治区）地质局（办事处）在1958年，对中央企业和地方企业以及对外贸易所需要的矿产资源，要从全面出发，统一规划，通盘安排。按照这一计划，1958年地质部系统除了要继续普查勘探某些大型企业所需要的资源以外，还将大大加强对中小型企业所需资源的普查勘探工作。
