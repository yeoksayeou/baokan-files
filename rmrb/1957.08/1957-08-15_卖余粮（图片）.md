Selling Surplus Grain

Since the unfolding of the socialist great debate in rural areas across the country, the political awareness of peasants has greatly increased, and they are enthusiastically selling surplus grain and handing in public grain to the state. In many places, the time for grain to enter the granary has been advanced compared to the past.
