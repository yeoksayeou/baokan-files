Yang Shouda and Others Fantasize About Singing an "Opposition Tune" Against the Party
Guizhou People's Publishing House Exposes Their Conspiracy to Publish Reactionary Publications

(Our Dispatch) During May and June, the right-wing group at the Guizhou People's Publishing House, led by editors Yang Shouda and Qian Ge, concentrated their fire on the Party leadership, attempting to bring down the Party's leadership of the publishing house. Yang Shouda described the publishing house leaders as "bosses setting up cigarette stands in the streets and alleys," completely ignorant of the characteristics of the publishing business. He completely obliterated the work achievements and experiences of the publishing house over the past few years. Qian Ge attacked the leadership, saying: "Our editor-in-chief's level is not high; he is neither a writer nor an expert, and he doesn't understand literature and art. The editor-in-chief should be replaced."

Not only did they attempt to abolish the Party's leadership over the publishing house, but the right-wing group organized by editors Qian Ge, Yang Shouda, Cheng Zhaorui, Long Guangpei, Deng Lei, Hu Weizhou, Tan Diffei, and others, were also actively preparing to publish a reactionary publication – "Literary Youth." They had a tight organizational division of labor and an anti-communist program. They held five meetings successively, fiercely discussing the program. Yang Shouda advocated "not reflecting socialist construction life and minority nationality life." Deng Lei said: "The words 'Marxism-Leninism as the guiding ideology' should be completely omitted." They unanimously determined that the publication should sing an opposition tune to "Shanhua" (the literary journal of the Guizhou Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles) and "Wujiang" (the Guizhou Daily supplement). Hu Weizhou advocated: We must seize the shortcomings of "Shanhua" and "Wujiang," fire a few shots at them, and raise our own status. In short, they tried every means to bring down "Shanhua" and "Wujiang" in order to further occupy the Guizhou literary scene. Right-wing elements such as Qian Ge, Yang Shouda, Hu Weizhou, Deng Zongyue, Xu Xinrong, Long Guangpei, etc., also studied together, preparing to co-write a "Romance of Eradicating the Three Evils" in the style of a chapter novel to systematically slander and uglify the leaders of the publishing house one by one.

Under everyone's pursuit, Qian Ge admitted that their purpose was to abolish the Party's leadership, drive away the president of the publishing house, and run the publishing house according to their ideas (bourgeois methods), pulling the publishing house onto the bourgeois road. Yang Shouda also admitted that at least they had to make the publishing house disorganized and anarchic. At that time, they could act according to their own ideas and lead the publishing house in a bourgeois direction.

When the right-wing group's anti-Party conspiracy was exposed, and the right-wing group was about to collapse, Qian Ge personally took to the field to cheer on the right-wing elements and wrote a 6,000-word paper publicly opposing Marxist-Leninist dialectics, saying that "dialectics is sophistry; it always says what it is against." Qian Ge also said: "After liberation, the workers got political power, the peasants got land, what did the intellectuals get?" This was clearly a continued incitement of intellectuals to attack the Party and to uphold their anti-Party and anti-socialist stance. The comrades of the publishing house stated that they must further expose and criticize their reactionary words and deeds, continue to deepen this struggle, and never stop until complete victory is won!

### 杨守达等妄想与党唱“对台戏”  贵州人民出版社揭穿他们出版反动刊物阴谋

    杨守达等妄想与党唱“对台戏”
    贵州人民出版社揭穿他们出版反动刊物阴谋
    本报讯　5、6月间，贵州人民出版社以编辑杨守达、钱革为首的右派集团，集中火力向党的领导开火，企图搞垮出版社的党领导。杨守达把出版社领导描绘成是“大街小巷摆香烟摊的老板”，根本不懂得出版事业的特点。把出版社几年来的工作成绩和经验完全抹煞。钱革攻击领导说：“我们总编辑的水平不高，既不是作家也不是专家，又不懂文艺，要调换总编辑。”
    他们不仅企图取消党对出版社的领导，以该社编辑钱革、杨守达、程肇瑞、龙光沛、邓雷、胡危舟、谭涤非等七人组织的右派集团，还积极准备出版反动刊物——“文学青年”。他们有着严密的组织分工和反共纲领。他们曾先后召开五次会议，激烈地讨论过纲领。杨守达主张“不反映社会主义建设生活和少数民族生活”，邓雷说：“马列主义为指导思想这些词句干脆不要。”他们一致确定刊物要与“山花”（贵州省文联的文艺刊物）、“乌江”（贵州日报副刊）唱对台戏。胡危舟主张：要抓住“山花”、“乌江”的缺点，放它几炮，抬高自己的身价。总之，他们千方百计要搞垮“山花”和“乌江”，进一步占领贵州文坛。钱革、杨守达、胡危舟、邓宗岳、徐心荣、龙光沛等右派分子还曾在一起研究，准备以章回小说的笔法合写一本“除三害演义”，来系统地把出版社的领导一个个加以污蔑和丑化。
    钱革在大家的追击下承认：他们的目的是要取消党的领导，把社长赶跑，使出版社按照他们的想法（资产阶级的办法）来办，把出版社拉到资产阶级的道路上去。杨守达也承认至少要把出版社搞成散垮垮的，成为无组织、无政府状态，那时就可按照自己的想法办事，把出版社引向资产阶级的方向。
    当右派集团的反党阴谋被揭穿后，右派集团眼看着就要土崩瓦解了，钱革就亲自上阵，为右派分子打气，并写了长达六千字的论文，公开反对马列主义辩证法，说“辩证法是诡辩，说来说去都是它的对。”钱革还说：“解放了工人得政权，农民得土地，知识分子得到什么呢？”这显然是继续煽动知识分子向党进攻，坚持其反党反社会主义的立场。出版社的同志们表示一定要进一步揭发、批判他们的反动言行，继续把这一斗争深入下去，不获全胜，绝不收兵！
