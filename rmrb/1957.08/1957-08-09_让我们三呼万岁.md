Rightists say they are tired of hearing "Long Live the Communist Party!" In fact, they simply don't like to hear it, they detest hearing it! Because in their hearts, they wish the Communist Party would collapse immediately. They think that as long as the Chinese Communist Party collapses, as long as no one shouts "Long Live the Communist Party," they can step forward, once again rule the world, and thus re-enslave the people and do whatever they want!

But this is a dream!

"Long Live the Communist Party" is the unanimous heartfelt wish of the people of the whole country. The Chinese Communist Party has won the unanimous and lofty love of the people precisely because so many outstanding party members shed a great deal of blood for the freedom and happiness of the Chinese people, and precisely because so many outstanding party members selflessly took the lead in creating the most glorious cause of mankind in socialist construction.

Since the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, regardless of north or south, day or night, "Long Live the Communist Party" has always echoed in people's hearts, because it encouraged the people's confidence and courage in difficult times, and today, in peaceful construction, it gives people the power to forge ahead and realize even higher ideals.

As far back as thirty years ago, when I was still in the fourth grade of primary school, it was the dark era when Huang Shaohong and his ilk were carrying out the Kuomintang's reactionary massacre. In Chao'an, Guangdong alone, Communist Party members were killed in batches, and workers, farmers, and intellectuals were slaughtered by the tens of thousands. My family lived in a slum area, close to the pseudo-county government, the City God Temple, and the Liao Clan Ancestral Hall. The Liao Clan Ancestral Hall was then stationed by the师部 (division headquarters) of the Kuomintang army. Almost every day, hundreds of captured kind people, with paper tags marked with red ink attached to their necks, were pushed past my door and escorted to the Han River or the wilderness outside Chuncheng Tower in the south of the city to be slaughtered, accompanied by the gloomy sound of military bugles. Among these many kind people, there were white-haired old men, young mothers holding infants, and even children the same age as me, two by two, stuffed into baskets and carried to the execution ground! I can be a witness to all of this!

And I am willing to be a witness for such a brave man of about twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old. He was tied up with five-flower ropes and surrounded by dense rifles and bayonets, passing through the crowd standing silently on both sides of the road. He held his head high and shouted "Long Live the Chinese Communist Party!" all the way.

The dying cry of this brave man moved the citizens standing silently on both sides of the road to tears, but undoubtedly, it also sowed the seeds of hatred in the hearts of thousands upon thousands of people, and encouraged confidence in the future.

The brave man shouted "Long Live the Chinese Communist Party" with a heart full of enthusiasm, representing the inner voice of the oppressed people at that time, but the enemy, like today's rightists, did not like to hear it! Because this cry formed a torrent of waves that would engulf them all!

Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Chinese people, after a long period of struggle with one stepping into the breach as another fell, finally won the liberation of the entire mainland. In the early days of liberation, I returned to my hometown of Guangdong, which I had been away from for nearly twenty years. At that time, the peasants in Enping County were vigorously carrying out land reform. When struggling against the landlord class, the peasants vented their generational grievances at once! A blind old peasant woman accused the landlord of killing her only son. That was during the famine years, her son had merely dug up a "sweet potato" from the landlord's field and was beaten to death on the spot by the landlord with a乱棍 (chaotic sticks), and forced this old mother to cry until she went blind, begging for a living in foreign townships and counties for many years. But under the leadership of the Communist Party, she finally stood up and finally avenged her son. When she stroked Chairman Mao's portrait with trembling hands, she couldn't help but shed tears and said: "Although my eyes are blind, my heart has seen the light!"

In those famine years, because of the drought, strange "bamboo rice" grew on the bamboo leaves. The landlords seized a few handfuls of rice from the broken jars and pots of every household as rent, but did not allow the hungry peasants to enter the bamboo forest to pick a grain of "bamboo rice" to satisfy their hunger. The son of Qiao Panmu, the widow, was still very young at that time. At dawn, he picked two small pumpkins and hid them under his tattered clothes and entered the village, when he bumped into someone and was so scared that he dropped the pumpkins on the ground. Fortunately, he bumped into Cen Yanqin, who was working as a hired hand. Cen Yanqin helped him pick up the small pumpkins, hid them well, and told him to go home quickly. During the land reform, Cen Yanqin was the head of the poor and hired peasants group, while Qiao Panmu and her son were activists. Her son had grown up and was already able to hold a rifle to guard the landlords and local bullies, and the platform for struggling against the bullies and the fences for detaining the landlords and local bullies were made of bamboo that had grown the bamboo rice.

After the peasants overthrew the landlord class and were distributed land, at the meeting celebrating the victory of land reform, thousands of peasants couldn't help but shout "Long Live the Communist Party."

"Long Live the Communist Party," the peasants' thunderous cheers, marked their joy at turning over politically and economically. And today, the rightists want the people of the whole country not to shout "Long Live the Communist Party." Can they do it! This cry is a triumphant song of victory that the Chinese people have followed the Party for decades and fought with countless bloodshed, can it be allowed to be scorned by the rightists?

In the short seven years since the liberation of the mainland, the Party has brought us bright and sunny days and infinitely magnificent life, which every Chinese citizen can deeply feel. Even the pastoral areas in the remote mountains of the frontier of the motherland have also received the Party's full warmth and care.

Two years ago, I went to the Kazakh pastoral area in the Tianshan Mountains of Xinjiang and spent some time with the Kazakh herders. I learned that their lives were very miserable in the old society. The Kuomintang army massacred them ravine after ravine, and they wandered around without peace. The reactionary rule brought them terrible poverty and misfortune. Some of them had only one sheep for a family of three, and some rode their only skinny horse across the mountains to beg for food. But in the few years after liberation, every family generally had hundreds of sheep, several swift horses for transportation, and three or five fat dairy cows. Their pastoral cooperative's flocks of sheep and herds of cattle roamed the vast alpine grasslands, and herds of horses frolicked by the streams. The yurts shone like white sails in the sun. Kazakh girls have already put on shiny black leather boots, and newly married Kazakh young women have already put on beautiful silver ornaments.

This huge change in life is unforgettable for the Kazakh herders. When they pray, they mention Chairman Mao's name. When they celebrate festivals, they always enthusiastically shout "Long Live the Chinese Communist Party!"

"Long Live the Chinese Communist Party" is the heartfelt cry of the 600 million Chinese people. This earth-shattering roar will shatter the central nervous system of the rightists who emit snake-like hisses and rat-like whispers!

The Chinese Communist Party is as firm as steel and as solid as a rock! Let us shout "Long Live the Communist Party" three times!

    让我们三呼万岁
    碧野
    右派分子说“共产党万岁”他们听腻了！其实他们是根本就不爱听，厌恶听！因为在他们的心目中是恨不得共产党立即垮台的。他们想只要中国共产党垮了，只要没有人喊“共产党万岁”了，他们就可以挺身而出，再度君临天下，从而可以重新奴役人民，为所欲为！
    但这是梦想！
    “共产党万岁”是全国人民一致的心声，人民高呼共产党万岁是出于非常真挚的感情的。中国共产党取得全国人民一致崇高的爱戴，正因为有许许多多优秀的党员为中国人民的自由幸福流下了大量的鲜血，正因为有许许多多优秀的党员在社会主义的建设中奋不顾身地带头创造人类最辉煌的事业。
    自从中国共产党成立以来，地无分南北，时不分昼夜，“共产党万岁”总是在人们的心中回响，由于它在艰苦的年代鼓舞了人民的信心和勇气，而在和平建设的今天，却给予人们以勇往直前实现更高理想的力量。
    远在三十年前，我还在上初小四年级，那时正当黄绍竑之流执行国民党反动屠杀的黑暗年代，只广东潮安一地，共产党员就成批成批地被杀害了，而且工人、农民和知识分子也成千成万地被残杀了。我家那时住在贫民区，紧靠伪县政府、城隍庙和廖氏祠堂。廖氏祠堂当时驻着国民党军队的师部，几乎每天都有百十成群被捕的善良的人们，脖子上被插上朱笔勾决的纸令牌，推过我家门前，在阴惨惨的军号声中，被押往韩江边或城南春城楼外的荒郊上去屠杀。在这许多善良的人当中，有白发苍苍的老人，有怀抱婴儿的年轻母亲，甚至还有跟我那时年纪一样大的儿童也被两个两个地塞在箩筐里，抬往刑场去！这些我都可以做见证人！
    并且我愿意作这么一个年约二十七八岁的勇士的见证人，他被五花大绑，在密密的步枪和刺刀的簇拥中，穿过夹道静立的人群，他昂着头，一路高呼“中国共产党万岁！”
    这勇士壮烈牺牲前的呼声，使静立在道路两旁的市民感动得流泪，但无疑的，也给上千上万的人心里播下了仇恨的种籽，和鼓舞了对未来的信心。
    勇士满腔热血高呼“中国共产党万岁”，是代表了当时被压迫的人民内心的呼声的，但敌人正如今天的右派分子一样，他们是不爱听的！因为这呼声形成洪涛激浪，就会把他们全部淹没！
    中国人民在共产党领导之下，经过了前仆后继长期的斗争，终于获得了全国大陆的解放。解放初期，我回到了久别将近二十年的故乡广东，那时正是恩平县的农民在轰轰烈烈地闹土改。在斗争地主阶级的时候，农民们把世代的冤仇一旦申雪！一个瞎眼的老农妇控诉地主杀害了她的独子，那是在饥荒年间，她儿子仅仅挖了地主的一个“金山芋”，就被地主当场用乱棍打死了，并且逼得这个年老的母亲哭瞎了眼睛，长年在外乡外县乞讨度日。但是在共产党的领导下，她终于翻身了，终于替她的儿子报了仇。当她用颤动的手抚摸着毛主席的画像的时候，她禁不住流下了热泪说：“虽然我的眼睛瞎了，但是我的心却见到了光明！”
    在那饥荒年间，因为天旱，竹叶子上生长了奇异的“竹米”。地主夺走家家户户破坛烂罐里的几把米充作租谷，但却不许饥饿的农民走进竹林去采粒“竹米”充饥。寡妇桥泮母的儿子那时还很小，黎明时摘了两个小南瓜藏在破衣下进村，迎面碰上了一个人，吓得他把南瓜滚落地上。好在他碰上的是当长工的岑炎勤，岑炎勤帮他拾起小南瓜藏好了，叫他赶快回家去。在土改期间，岑炎勤是贫雇农组长，而桥泮母和她的儿子是积极分子。她的儿子长大了，已经能拿着步枪在看守地主恶霸了，而斗霸台和关禁地主恶霸的栅栏，就是用当年长过竹米的竹子搭成和编成的。
    农民们斗倒了地主阶级和分到了土地后，在庆祝土改胜利的大会上，千百农民就情不自禁地高呼“共产党万岁”。
    “共产党万岁”，农民们这雷鸣的欢呼声，是标志着他们在政治上和经济上翻身的喜悦。而今天右派分子想要全国人民不喊“共产党万岁”能办得到吗！这呼声是中国人民几十年来跟着党走、是用无数的流血斗争得来的胜利凯歌，难道能容许右派分子轻蔑吗？
    在全国大陆解放后的短短七年中，党给我们带来了阳光灿烂的日子和无限瑰丽的生活，这是每一个中国公民都能深切感受到的。即使是远在祖国边疆深山里的牧区，也同样得到党的充分的温暖和关怀。
    两年前我去新疆天山哈萨克牧区，和哈萨克牧民相处过一段日子。我了解到他们在旧社会生活是非常悲惨的，国民党军队曾经整条山沟整条山沟地屠杀他们，他们辗转流徙，得不到安宁。反动统治给他们带来可怕的贫穷和不幸，他们有的一家三口只有一只羊，有的骑着仅有的一匹瘦马跋涉在山岭间乞食。但是解放后几年，他们每家普遍都有百十只羊、几匹代步的骏马和三、五头肥壮的奶牛。他们牧业社的羊群和牛群漫游在辽阔的高山草原上，马群嬉逐在溪流边，蒙古包像点点白帆闪耀在阳光下。哈萨克姑娘们已经穿上了黑亮的油皮靴，新婚的哈萨克少妇已经戴上了美丽的银饰。
    这种生活上的巨大变化，是哈萨克牧民们永生难忘的。当他们作祈祷的时候，他们要念起毛主席的名字，当他们欢度节日的时候，总要热情高呼“中国共产党万岁”！
    “中国共产党万岁”是中国六亿人民出自内心的欢呼，这山摇地动的巨响，是要把右派分子发出蛇鸣鼠语的神经中枢震碎的！
    中国共产党是坚如钢铁、固如磐石的！让我们三呼共产党万岁！
