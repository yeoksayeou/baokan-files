    I seem to be searching for something by the roadside.
    I originally had no home. I never imagined that fifteen years after leaving my hometown, a chance opportunity would lead me to pass by this village where I was born. The memories are familiar, but the new buildings and new roads feel foreign to me. I wandered along the road for a long time, but couldn't even run into a single acquaintance. Most of the older people have passed away, and those of my generation and the middle-aged are still in the army. I heard people say that many old Red Army soldiers have recently returned here, and like me, they originally had no home. In the corner where they were born, they are also searching for something by the roadside, just like me. I hesitated on the road for a long, long time, but I picked up those forgotten memories.
    Past memories are never like the little blue flowers by the roadside; they are like the past years, a river of pain...
    People think I have some unwarranted indifference to "home". But they don't know that I have no home.
    I was only eight years old when I went out to wander. I spent my days wandering the streets, suffering hardship and adversity. One day, before dawn, the biting wind and snow froze me awake. In order to thaw and warm up, I had to run down the street with my feet, swollen red with cold. I ran to the entrance of a charitable orphanage and suddenly heard faint cries of a baby. My steps became heavy – in front of the closed door of the orphanage, on a snowdrift blocking the door, a baby was abandoned in a bamboo basket. The child had no clothes, only a few strands of dry grass wrapped around it. This scene reminded me of the impoverished mother of that baby, and also of myself.
    I stood and stood, until the streetlights had extinguished their dim yellow light, until there were pedestrians on the road, and also police officers. I waited and waited, but I couldn't wait for the orphanage door to open, nor could I wait for someone to pick up this abandoned baby. At most, they would just take a look and then leave with a sigh. So, I stared at the baby and cried, and picked him up, wanting to warm him with my own body. And he seemed to have received the opportunity to cry and wail, crying even more fiercely in my arms. I was coaxing the child when someone pulled me from behind. The police took me to the police station. Although I cried and screamed on the road, wanting to break free from him, all my efforts were in vain. The police officer asked me why I was doing something immoral - abandoning a baby. I was grieved, stared blankly, and couldn't answer anything. I really wanted to vent all the anger I had suffered these days on the police officer, but what could a child do? When they finally drove me out of that dark and forbidding gate, I thought of the abandoned baby again, and tears flowed silently. As I thought and thought, I burst into tears. For the first time, I felt so sorry for myself...
    Nine years later, I went to another city. Here, the Liberation War was raging fiercely. In the intense sound of artillery fire, I heard a wounded soldier groaning by the door, and the intermittent words: "Liberated!" On his pale face, his teeth were clenched tightly on his lips, and blood was dripping on the ground - I thought, he is bleeding, isn't it precisely to bring us these words? At that time, I really wanted to hug his blood-stained body and then lift him up and sing. But I also felt sorry for him, afraid of jarring his wounds. A few days later, I followed them. We marched all day in the flames of war, like a broad and mighty iron torrent, breaking through all obstacles and advancing towards a distant goal. At this time, I thought of many, many things. The more I thought of the pain of the past, the more I felt the joy of the present; the more I remembered that I was a homeless orphan, the more I felt that I was now growing up in that broad and boundless big family.
    Once, in a newly liberated city on the Leizhou Peninsula, we lived on the floor of a dilapidated hotel with a large group of newly recruited recruits - some students who hadn't yet put on military uniforms. The uneven floor that blocked the spine of their backs made them unable to get used to lying on it, but they didn't say a word, but I knew they weren't asleep. Late at night, enemy planes came, and they all panicked and crawled up, clinging tightly together, with several pairs of eyes staring fixedly at the shaking roof. It wouldn't do to stay like this. So, when the enemy planes flew a little further away, we asked them to disperse. When the "whistling" sound of the bombs about to land sounded, a new soldier jumped up again, wanting to run further away. "Lie down! Lie down!" an old soldier shouted sternly, and quickly rushed up, using his powerful hands to press that person to the ground. At this moment, with a "boom", the bomb landed, and all we saw before us was a wave of earth rising up, and the smell of gunpowder scattering. When I thought of those two people just now, my heart tightened. As soon as the plane left, we all ran to them at the same time - the old soldier was lying on top of the new soldier. When he saw us, he got up, shook off the dirt covering his body, cursed "damn you" at the sky where the enemy plane had just flown, and strode away. The new soldier was stunned for a long time, staring blankly at his departing back, and after a long time, he shouted: "Comrade! Comrade! What's your name!" We faintly heard him say "Go put out the fire!" He leaped into a pile of raging flames to fight the disaster again. The new soldier picked up a piece of shrapnel next to him, and when he saw that it was covered with fresh blood, he instinctively touched his body, but there wasn't a single wound. Following the road the soldier had taken to put out the fire, drops of fresh blood were dripping. He was so moved that he cried. Watching and thinking, I felt once again that this is my home, these are my brothers. I don't know why I cried...
    And why am I now coming to this mountain city to look for a home? I have a home now. If I meet a general here who is looking for a home, I will definitely reach out and hug him, telling him about a life that is more beautiful than childhood dreams - the life in our "home". Telling him how during the pursuit battle in the South, night blindness made me walk with a stick, and because I couldn't keep up with the team, how my comrades pulled me along, dragged me along, and carried me on their shoulders loaded with too many bullets. At that time, I thought: "Even if I go blind, I will grope my way forward; even if I fall behind, I will grope for the footprints of my comrades and follow my beloved home closely."

    家
　　周良沛
    我，仿佛在路旁寻觅什么。
    我原来是没有家的。没有想到在离开故乡十五年后，一个偶然的机会又让我路过这生我的村庄。记忆，是熟悉的，新的建筑、新的道路，对我却陌生了。我在路上溜达了很久，连一个熟人也碰不到。年老的人大都去世了，我们这一辈的人和中年人都还在军队里。听人说这里最近回来不少老红军，也像我一样原是没有家的。他们在那生他的那个角落，也像我一样在路旁寻觅什么。我长久长久地在路上踟蹰，却拾回那些遗忘了的记忆。
    过往的记忆总不是路边蓝色的小花，像过往的年代一样，是条痛苦的河。……
    我对“家”，人们认为总有些不应有的冷漠。而他们却不知道我是没有家的。
    我出外流落时才八岁。终日徘徊街头，受苦受难。有一天，天还没亮，刺骨的风雪就把我冻醒了。为了解冻取暖，我不得不用冻得红肿的脚在街上跑。跑到一个慈育院门口，忽听到一声声微弱的婴儿哭声。脚步，沉重了——在紧闭着的慈育院的门前，封住门的雪堆上，一个竹篮里放着一个弃婴。孩子没有衣服，只有几根干草裹住。这情景，使我想起那婴儿的贫困的母亲，也想起我自己。
    我站着、站着，一直到路灯已熄灭了暗黄的光，一直到路上有了行人，也有了警察。我盼呀盼，可一直盼不到慈育院的门打开，也盼不到一个人把这个弃婴拾走，他们最多也只是看一看，便叹着气走了。于是，我盯着这婴儿哭了，并把他抱了起来，想用自己的身子暖和暖和他。而他仿佛得到可以哭诉的机会，在我怀里哭叫得更厉害了。我正在哄着孩子，后面有人把我一拉，警察把我拉到警察局去了。尽管我在路上哭着、叫着，想挣脱他，而一切办法都无济于事。警官问我为什么作不道德的事——弃婴，我悲痛，瞠目，什么也回答不出来。我真想把这些日子所受的气都出在警官身上，可是一个孩子又有什么办法？当他们最后把我赶出那黑漆的卫门时，我又想到那个弃婴，泪，无声地流着，想着想着，也放声大哭起来。我第一次感到我在这么可怜自己……
    九年后，我又到另一个城市了。这儿，解放战争正在炽烈地进行。在猛烈的炮火声中，我听见一个伤员在门边的呻吟声，和断断续续的那么一句话：“解放了！”他惨白的脸上，牙齿紧紧咬住嘴唇，血，正滴在地上——我想着，他流血，不正是为了给我们带来这一句话么？那时，我真想抱住他染血的身子，然后举起他来唱歌。可是我又疼他，怕震动他的伤口。不几天，我跟着他们走了。整日都在烽火中行进，像一条宽阔浩荡的铁流，冲破一切障碍，向远大的目标前进。这时，我想的很多很多。越想往日的痛苦，就越感到眼前的欢乐；越想起我是无家可归的孤儿，就越感到我现在是生长在那宽阔无边的大家庭中。
    有一次，在雷州半岛的一个刚解放的城中，我们同新招收的一大批新力军——一些还没穿军衣的学生住在一个破旧的旅馆的地板上。凸凹不平梗住背脊的地板使他们还不能习惯在上面躺下，但没作声，可是我知道他们没睡着。深夜，敌机来了，他们都惊慌地爬起来，紧紧地靠在一起，有几双眼睛死死盯住震动的房顶。这样呆下去是不行的。于是当敌机稍稍飞远了一些，我们便要他们疏散开。当炸弹快要落地的“丝丝”声响起的时候，一个新战士又跃起来想再跑远些。“趴下！趴下！”一个老战士严厉地喊了一声，就飞快地赶上去，用有力的双手将那个人按在地上。这时“轰”的一声，炸弹落地了，眼前只见一片掀起的土浪，飞散的火药味。我一想到刚才那两个人，心就紧了。飞机一走，我们都不约而同地奔到他们俩的跟前——老战士正伏在新战士身上，他一见我们，就爬起来抖了抖盖在身上的泥土，对着敌机刚飞过的天空骂了一句“你娘的”就大步走了。那个新战士愣了半天，呆呆地看着他远去的背影，很久才叫了起来：“同志！同志！你叫什么！”隐隐地只听见他说声“救火去！”他又跃入一堆熊熊的火焰中去救灾了。新战士拾起身边的一块弹片，一见鲜血满片，就本能地摸摸身上，但没一点伤痕，而顺着战士去救火的路，却滴着一滴滴鲜血，他感动得哭了。我看着，想着，再次地感到这就是我的家，这就是我的兄弟。我也不知道为什么哭了……
    而我现在为什么又来这山城寻家？我是有家的了。假若，我在这里碰见一位在寻家的将军，我一定伸出手抱住他，讲述一些比童年的梦幻更美的生活——我们“家”里的生活。讲述我在南方的追歼战中，夜盲如何使我拄着棍子走，由于赶不上队伍，战友们如何拉着我走，拖着我走，并用那荷着过重的子弹的肩把我背着走。那时，我曾这样想：“即使瞎了也要摸着走；即使掉了队，也要摸着同志们的脚印前进，紧紧跟着我可爱的家。”
