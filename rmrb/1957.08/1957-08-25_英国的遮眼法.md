　　Britain's Eye-Shielding Tactics
　　By a commentator from this newspaper
    In recent days, British officials and their propaganda machine have rarely talked about the situation in Oman. Their deliberate silence is clearly intended to create the impression that the Oman issue is indeed an "internal affair" and that things are now calm and peaceful.
    Britain's indifferent attitude towards the situation in Oman is not sudden. Before adopting this attitude, it deliberately released a series of smokescreens. The British propaganda machine had boasted that its invading troops had "occupied" the Omani capital, Nizwa, and other important strongholds, that the Imam of Oman had "fled" from Omani territory, and that the British invading forces had withdrawn from Oman with only five casualties on both sides in more than a month of war, implying that the war was over and that it was not a real war. However, these British propaganda tricks were completely exposed by the statement of Saleh bin Issa, the Deputy Imam of Oman, who arrived in Cairo on the 22nd. According to Saleh bin Issa, the real situation in Oman is that the Imam of Oman is still in the country directing the anti-aggression war, and many important strongholds in Oman are still in the hands of the insurgents. Saleh bin Issa also stated that the Omani people would never stop fighting until they achieve complete independence and freedom.
    The Omani people are a nation that loves independence and freedom. In the uprising of 1915, the Omani people persisted in armed struggle for as long as five years, finally forcing Britain to recognize the independence of the Imamate of Oman and sign the "Treaty of Seeb." Since July of this year, the armed struggle waged by the Omani people has once again proved that the 550,000 Omani people are unyielding. The Omani people's struggle to protect their independence has received the active support of all Arab countries and has aroused widespread sympathy internationally.
    Britain's widespread lies about the end of the Oman war are clearly an eye-shielding tactic, attempting to deceive the world in order to escape responsibility for provoking the war of aggression against Oman. In the past year, Britain's reckless behavior in the Middle East has made itself infamous, and after carrying out armed suppression of the Omani insurgents, it has been unanimously condemned by Arab countries and peace-loving people around the world. In this way, Britain is forced to abandon the old method of openly attacking Oman and adopt the current vicious means of "nominal retreat, covert advance, outwardly relaxed, inwardly tense."
    When the United Nations Security Council discussed the Arab countries' complaint against Britain, U.S. Representative Lodge repeatedly emphasized that the conflict in the Oman region had "subsided," with the intention of diverting the attention of Arab countries, dividing the unity of Arab countries on the Oman issue, and打击打压the Arab national independence movement. It is now clear that U.S. and British imperialism are joining forces to deal with the Arab people in the Middle East. Britain is waging war in Oman and Yemen, while the United States is interfering in Syria's internal affairs. The U.S. Sixth Fleet, which is "exercising" in the Mediterranean, has moved east, and a new act of aggression against Syria and the Arab countries of the Middle East is being planned in close cooperation between the United States and Britain.
    Britain's open act of aggression against Oman and the United States' interference in Syria have been condemned by world public opinion. No matter what tactics U.S. and British imperialism use in invading the Arab countries of the Middle East, they cannot stop the struggle of the Arab peoples for independence.

### 英国的遮眼法

　　英国的遮眼法
　　本报评论员
    最近几天来，英国官方和它的宣传机关很少谈论阿曼的局势了。它们这样故作沉默，显然是想在人们中间造成一种印象：似乎阿曼问题确实是“内部问题”，而且现在已经平静无事了。
    英国对阿曼局势表示冷淡的态度，这并不是突然而来的。它在采取这种态度之前，曾经有意地放出了一连串的烟幕弹。英国宣传机关曾大事吹嘘说，它的侵略军队已经“占领”了阿曼首都尼兹瓦和其他重要据点，阿曼教长已经“潜逃”出阿曼领土，并且有声有色地报道了英国侵略军从阿曼撤退，双方在一个多月的战争中仅仅死伤了五个人，言外之意是好像这场战争已经结束了，并且这算不了什么真正的战争。但是，英国这些宣传伎俩，被22日抵达开罗的阿曼副教长萨拉赫·本·伊萨的发言全部拆穿了。据萨拉赫·本·伊萨说，阿曼的真正情况是：阿曼教长仍在国内指挥反侵略战争，阿曼的许多重要据点仍在起义者的手中。萨拉赫·本·伊萨并且表示，在获得完全的独立和自由以前，阿曼人民决不停止战斗。
    阿曼人民是热爱独立和自由的民族。阿曼人民在1915年的起义中，曾经坚持过五年之久的武装斗争，终于迫使英国承认了阿曼教长国的独立，并且签订了“西卜条约”。今年7月以来，阿曼人民所进行的武装斗争，再一次证明五十五万阿曼人民是不可屈服的。阿曼人民保护独立的斗争，得到了所有阿拉伯国家的积极支持，在国际上也引起了广泛的同情。
    英国散布阿曼战事已经结束的漫天大谎，显然是一种遮眼法，企图遮蔽世人耳目，以逃避挑起侵略阿曼战争的责任。近一年来，英国在中东的胡作非为，已经使自己声名狼籍，对阿曼起义人民实行武力镇压以后，又遭到阿拉伯国家和世界和平人民的一致指责。这样，英国被迫放弃明目张胆进攻阿曼的老办法，而采取目前的“名退暗进、外松内紧”的恶毒手段。
    在联合国安理会讨论阿拉伯国家对英国控诉案的时候，美国代表洛奇一再强调阿曼地区冲突已经“平息”，其用心也无非是在转移阿拉伯国家的视线，分化阿拉伯国家在阿曼问题上的团结，打击阿拉伯民族的独立运动。现在已经看得很清楚，美英帝国主义正结合起来对付中东阿拉伯人民。英国在阿曼、也门进行战争，美国则在对叙利亚内政进行干涉。在地中海“演习”的美国第六舰队已经东移，一个针对叙利亚和中东阿拉伯国家的新的侵略行动，正在英美两国紧锣密鼓地合作策划中。
    英国对阿曼的公开侵略行为，美国对叙利亚的干涉活动，已经受到世界舆论的谴责。不论美英帝国主义在侵略中东阿拉伯国家中耍些什么手法，都决不能阻挡阿拉伯国家人民争取独立的斗争。
