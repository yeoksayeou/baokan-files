    "Mantis Arm" Record
    Ma Qianzu
    Preface
    The author of "Cicada Chirp Residence" Essays, Huichun, said: "Due to the climate elsewhere, I have been silent for several years, truly 'muzzled like a cicada in winter.' This year, having come to Beijing, I have written many essays, spreading noises that disturb afternoon naps in the space of the Hundred Schools of Thought. Knowing that disturbing afternoon naps is insensitive, I am compelled by the climate, unable to stop, and since the mantis has not come to hunt me, I must continue to chirp 'Cicada...Cicada...'" I dare not consider myself a mantis hunting Huichun, who has been "muzzled like a cicada in winter" for several years. However, given the "Essays" author's extensive citations and thorough reading of classical works from China and abroad, he is indeed a large cart before the mantis. Zhuangzi said: "It is like a mantis angrily raising its arms to stop a chariot, which it is certainly unable to do!" Thus, I present the "Mantis Arm" Record.
    I. "Unlearned"
    The first section of the Essays is "Learning," intended to criticize the "unlearned" senior cadres. It contains the "aphorism": "I often hear that many senior cadres, even those who run schools and lead others in learning, are always busy, and although they have the will to learn, objective conditions do not allow it." "But some senior cadres today are, after all, Marxists, so their 'talent' is extraordinary. I see some people who do not read yet are very good at leading others in reading, and very good at criticizing the opinions that readers derive from reading, and even at drawing conclusions": "It is said that their basis is their position!"
　  II.　"Incompetent"
    The second section of the Essays is "Thought" and "Following," intended to criticize senior cadres for not "thinking" but "following," for "ruining" others but not "ruining" themselves, for being "incompetent" but "capable." Combining it with the previous section, it means "unlearned and incompetent." It contains the "aphorism":
    "There is now such a person, naturally a Marxist, and a leader, whose position is neither very low nor very high. The characteristics of their behavior can be hypothetically described as follows: on the issue of literary creation, one year, they advocated the 'no-conflict theory'; a little over a year later, the Soviet Union opposed the 'no-conflict theory,' and they also vehemently opposed no-conflict, criticizing 'no-conflict theory' advocates relentlessly; after another period, they came to oppose exposing the dark side; but recently, they are resolute advocates that even poisonous weeds can bloom freely." "It is inconsequential for them to follow, but they are leaders, so those who are led... are truly slowly 'ruined'." They never get 'ruined' even though they ‘follow’, and they are eternally enlightened leaders. Why is that? It is said to be due to their position."
    III. "Two Secrets"
    The third section of the Essays is "Basis," which reveals "two secrets" of being a leader. Excerpted sentences below:
    Secret one: "The actual materials for the remarks of those leaders who are accustomed to 'following' are 'useless'." "They also have their own method of handling these documents," "When opposing the Right, one must be thoroughly leftist, and when opposing the Left, one must be extremely rightist. Each time they 'follow' only one side of the document. But, it is said that this is a sign of strong Party spirit, and an implementation of the intentions of higher-level leaders."
    There is another secret: "Senior cadres often have 'secret books' and 'secret rumors'." "The prestige of such leaders among the masses is indeed very high, because they can often use 'secret books' and 'secret rumors' to say things that the masses cannot see in the newspapers, making the masses believe that there are truly magical pills in their gourds."
    IV. "Qin Hui" and "Cat"
    The fourth section of the Essays is "Talking about Basis Again." Praising Cao Cao's honesty, cursing Qin Hui's cunning, and hating the cat's ruthlessness. Excerpted sentences below:
    "Cao Cao killed Lü Boshe due to a misunderstanding. When Chen Gong blamed him, he refused to admit his mistake and instead said, 'I would rather betray the people of the world than let the people of the world betray me!'"
    "Qin Hui killed Yue Fei. When Han Shizhong questioned him, 'What crime did Yue Fei commit?' he replied, 'Perhaps!'"
    "I heard of a leader who tried every means, grasping at shadows, mobilizing the masses, unifying understanding, and forcing another person to admit a huge crime; when that person asked for the definition of this crime, he said, 'That definition – it has no basis in classical works!' If it has no basis in classical works, then can it not be established? But, it absolutely must be established, this is creativity."
    "Cats eat mice without giving any reason, but in philosophy, there is a 'teleological' basis. If a cat wants to eat another cat, this is cannibalism, and it seems that some reason must be given, such as: 'You oppose my leadership, the masses want me to eat you...' and so on. In the end, there is only one basis, which is 'must eat!'"
    V.　"Just a Servant"
    The fifth section of the Essays discusses "Xiren's Essence," stating explicitly: "I now realize: Hua Xiren was originally a servant," and the ending then says "just a reading note" "not related to current reality." This writing technique is called "one capture and one release." "I now realize" naturally captures the meaning of the above four sections, but to avoid the suspicion of opposing leadership, it is released and avoided: not related to reality. It contains the "aphorism":
    "Xiren uses the hypocrisy, the 'most essential characteristic' of a servant, extremely thoroughly. The result of this thorough hypocrisy is that not only does Lady Dowager Shi and Madam Wang trust her extremely, but even Jia Baoyu, although he hates her, cannot help but like her (liking is not equal to loving), and cannot help but helplessly comply with her. Servants obey their masters and yet control their masters!" "Xiren's thorough hypocrisy is also manifested in that although she is usually very 'sincere' to her masters, once the time of 'when the tree falls, the monkeys scatter' arrives, her behavior makes people feel 'it is lamentable that actors are blessed, and pitiful that young masters have no chance.' Therefore, a true servile servant, his 'bit of love for the people' is of course hypocritical. His 'all-out obedience' to his master is equally hypocritical, his sincerity is only for himself and his own interests."
    VI. Conclusion
    Having finished recording "Cicada Chirp Residence Essays," looking back at the title I set for myself, I am greatly surprised. It turns out that the "senior cadres" and "leaders" in Huichun's eyes are "unlearned" and "incompetent," relying on "two secrets" to eat, without Cao Cao's honesty, having Qin Hui's cunning. And as ruthless as a "cat." According to their essence, they are nothing more than "obeying the master and yet controlling the master," "just a servant" like Xiren. And this "essence of Xiren," according to the author's affirmation: is not some "personal characteristic" but a "social archetype." What words! What words!! What words!!!

### “螳臂”录
马前卒

专栏：

    “螳臂”录
    马前卒
    序
    “蝉噪居”漫笔的作者回春说：“由于别处的气候的关系，我已经有好几年不作声了，真是‘禁若寒蝉’。今年到了北京，却很写了一些杂文，在百家争鸣的空间散播了扰人午梦的噪音。明知扰人午梦是不识趣的，但为气候所感，欲罢而不能，而且螳螂没有来追捕，所以还是要叫下去“‘知了……知了……’”我不敢自居于螳螂而追捕已经几年来“禁若寒蝉”的回春，然以“漫笔”作者之广征博引，读尽中外古今经典名著，则在螳螂之前，确是一辆大车，庄子曰：“犹螳螂之怒臂以当车轶，则必不胜任矣”！姑作“螳臂”录。
    一、“不学”
    漫笔的第一节是“学习”，意在针贬高级干部之“不学”。有“警句”云：“我常常听说，许多高级干部，甚至于自己办学校、领导别人的学习干部，总是叫忙，对于学习，心有余而客观条件不允许。”“但现在的有些高级干部毕竟是马克思主义者，所以那‘才略’，是非凡的。我看到，有些不读书的人，却极善于领导别人的读书，而且极善于批判读书的人从读书得来的言论，而且还要作结论”：“据说，他的依据，就是地位！”
　  二、　“无术”
    漫笔的第二节是“思”和“随”，意在针贬高级干部不“思”而“随”，“毁”人不“毁”己，“无术”而“有术”。合前节而言，即“不学无术”。有“警句”云：
    “现在有这样一种人，自然也是马克思主义者，而且是领导者，地位  不很低也不太高。他们的行为的特点，可以这样假定地来形容：在文艺创作问题上，有一年，他是主张‘无冲突论’的；过了一年多，苏联反对‘无冲突论’了，他也就大张旗鼓反对无冲突，把‘无冲突论’者批评得体无完肤；又过了一个时期，他又来反对暴露阴暗面了；但最近，他又是毒草也可以大放的坚决主张者。”“他自己随之，是无关紧要的，但他是领导者，于是被领导者……可真是慢慢地‘毁’了”。他虽然‘随’但永远不会‘毁’，永远是英明的领导者。为什么呢？据说也还是由于地位。”
    三、“两个秘密”
    漫笔的第三节是“根据”，说出了作为一个领导者的“两个秘密。”摘句于后：
    秘密之一：“那种惯于‘随’的领导者，其言论的……实际资料，那是‘没有用的’。”“对于这些文件，他也有他的处理法”，“反右时一定要左得彻底，反左时一定要右到极端。他每次‘随’的是文件中的一面。但是，据说这就是党性强，是对上级领导意图的贯彻。”
    还有一个秘密：“高级干部是常常有‘秘本’和‘秘闻’的。”“这种领导者，在群众中的威信，确实是很高的，因为他常常能够根据‘秘本’和‘秘闻’，说出一些群众在报纸上看不到的话，使得群众相信他的葫芦里真有灵丹妙药。”
    四、“秦桧”与“猫”
    漫笔第四节是“再谈根据”。颂曹操的老实，咒秦桧之狡诈，而又恨猫的狠毒。摘句于后：
    “曹操由于误会，杀了吕伯奢。陈宫责备他，他不肯检讨错误，反而说：‘宁可我负天下人，不可天下人负我！’”
    “秦桧杀了岳飞。韩世忠质问他：‘岳飞犯了什么罪？’他答道：‘莫须有！’”
    “我听说的一位领导者，千方百计，捕风捉影，发动群众，统一认识，严逼另一个人承认一个极大的罪名；当那人问这个罪名的定义的时候，他说：‘那定义——可是经典著作里面也没有根据呀！’经典著作里面没有根据，那么，可以不成立了罢？但是，偏偏一定还要成立，这是创造性。”
    “猫吃老鼠，是不讲任何理由的，但在哲学上，却有‘目的论’的根据。假若一只猫要吃另一只猫，这是同类相残了，似乎得讲一点理由，例如：‘你反对我的领导，群众要我吃你……’之类。说来说去，一定要吃。但到底却只有一个根据，就是‘一定要吃！’”
    五、　“奴才而已”
    漫笔的第五节是论“袭人的本质”，开宗明义道：“我这才知道：花袭人原来是个奴才”，而结尾则又说“只是一则读书笔记”“没有联系当前的实际”，这笔法，叫“一擒一纵”。“我这才知道”自然是擒住上面四节的文意，但为避免反领导之嫌，却又放掉躲开了：没联系实际。有“警句”云：
    “作为奴才的‘最本质的特性’的虚伪，被袭人运用得极其彻底了。这彻底虚伪的结果，不但使得史太君、王夫人极端信任她，而且使得贾宝玉，虽然痛恶她，却又不能不喜欢她（喜欢不等于爱），而且不能不无可奈何地依从她。奴才顺从主子而又制服主子”！“袭人的虚伪之彻底，又表现在平时虽然对主子十分‘真诚’，但一旦‘树倒猢狲散’的时候到来，她的行为，却使人发生‘堪叹优伶有福，可怜公子无缘’的感慨。所以，真正奴才气的奴才，他的‘一点点爱人民’，固然是虚伪的。他的对主子的‘百般顺从’，同样是虚伪的，他的真诚，只是对于他自己和自己的利益。”
    六、结语
    录“‘蝉噪居’漫笔”竟，回看我自己所立的标题，不觉大吃一惊。原来回春心目中的“高级干部”和“领导”是“不学”“无术”靠“两个秘密”吃饭，无曹操的老实，有“秦侩”之狡诈。而狠毒又如“猫”。按其本质，则不过是“顺从主子而又制服主子”如袭人一样的“奴才而已”。而这个“袭人的本质”，据作者肯定：不是什么“个人的特性”而是“社会典型”。这真是什么话！什么话！！什么话呀！！！
