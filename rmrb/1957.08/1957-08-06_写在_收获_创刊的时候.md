Written on the Occasion of the Inauguration of "Harvest"
　　Ba Jin, Jin Yi

　　On July 24, 1957, the inaugural issue of "Harvest" met with its vast readership. Its birth concretely realized the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom," and demonstrated the Party's wise leadership, strong support, and meticulous care.

　　Under the cruel rule of the reactionaries, the "Literary Quarterly," "Literary Monthly," and "Literary Series" that we edited were all successively strangled. At that time, we not only lost the freedom to edit, but, like many writers, even lost the freedom to write. But today, the Party trusts us and gives us courage and strength. The Chinese Writers Association gives us the task of compiling a large-scale literary publication and initiating socialist competition with other fraternal publications. This is enough to prove the vastly different experiences of a literary worker and editor before and after liberation.

　　We still love editing work very much. When we put in hard work and present a publication to the readers, in which, in addition to the masterpieces of established writers, we can also recommend emerging works by new talents, it brings the greatest joy to readers, authors, and editors alike. In the past difficult circumstances, whenever a publication was printed, we felt the greatest comfort and another victory. Our efforts were not in vain, our wishes were realized, we did not disappoint the writers' expectations, we did not bury the talents of newcomers, and we contributed a beneficial spiritual nourishment to the readers, which could increase their courage for life and struggle.

　　But today, twenty years later, when the Party gave us this task, although we were very happy, we also had deep concerns. Readers' demands have greatly increased, the ranks of writers are even more incomparably strong, and new writers are emerging all the time, just like the new things of our motherland. We doubt that our pitiful "old experience" is enough to meet the readers' demands, let alone effectively organize and unite the vast number of writers. In other words, we cannot fulfill the mission the Party gave us. But the Party once again dispelled our concerns, solved all our difficult problems for us, and asked us to do it boldly. Comrades also helped us in every possible way.

　　Thus, after half a year of planning and preparation, "Harvest" was published on schedule.

　　In this concrete work, we deeply realized that without the Party's leadership, support, and care, "Harvest" could not have been founded. The Party not only gave us spiritual encouragement, but also pointed out the direction and path of our work. Even many specific and complex tasks were solved for us. We are grateful for the Party's trust in us, which increases our sense of responsibility. We must be responsible to the Party, to the people, and to our fellow writers. The six criteria put forward by Chairman Mao are the guiding principles of our work, so that we will not lose our way at any time. Only by relying closely on the Party and under the leadership of the Party can we do a good job in editing and make "Harvest" more and more abundant year by year.

　　In the process of soliciting manuscripts, we also deeply realized that under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, the creative labor of Chinese writers is extremely vigorous. In every corner of the motherland, many writers are working diligently. Before the publication of the inaugural issue, we had already received sixty-nine pieces, ranging from novellas of tens of thousands of words to novels of hundreds of thousands of words, and we also knew that many writers would complete their masterpieces within this year and next year. The harvest of the motherland's revolutionary literary cause is really great. In the submitted manuscripts, we also saw the extremely serious and conscientious creative labor and sincere and humble attitude of many veteran writers. Some veteran writers' original manuscripts were densely filled with tiny characters, showing that they had been revised over and over again. After two or three years of writing, they still humbly asked the editors for revisions and sincerely listened to the opinions of the vast number of readers. Some writers did not complain that we published their works too late, but said that we should not have put their works in the inaugural issue, in order to let the works of other writers meet the readers as soon as possible. We generally do not arbitrarily revise writers' works. Even if we have opinions, we will raise them and send the original manuscripts back to the writers for them to revise themselves. Even if we find errors in the articles or things we don't understand, we will list them in detail and ask the writers to answer them themselves. Many writers have expressed their appreciation for our work. However, all the working comrades in our editorial department were not only moved by the writers' creative attitude and valuable qualities, but also received profound education, prompting us to be more serious, conscientious, sincere, and humble in our editing work.

　　We have written these things without fear of being tedious, just to use our deep feelings and concrete situations to refute the shameless slanders of those right-wing elements: don't want the leadership of the Party, literary work and creation are "not as good as before," there are irreconcilable contradictions between writers and editors...

　　But even so, before "Harvest" was launched, right-wing elements and those with right-wing ideas repeatedly used "Harvest" to create rumors for ulterior motives.

　　Shi Zhicun maliciously said that because "Wenyi Yuebao" had sectarianism, it first separated out a "Meng Ya" and then a "Harvest" (the general idea). In fact, the growth of "Meng Ya" is to open up a new garden for young literary workers. Therefore, from editors to authors, almost all are energetic young people. From the rising number of copies in each issue and the large number of manuscripts received every day, it shows that it is welcomed and supported by the vast number of young readers and authors, and it also shows that the Party's leadership is correct and its publication is timely and necessary. "Harvest" is a publication of the Chinese Writers Association, mainly publishing long and medium-length works, and there is no repetition or conflict with "Wenyi Yuebao." The editorial department is only located in Shanghai for the convenience of work. Right-wing elements fabricate things out of thin air and create rumors, just to try to slander the motherland's literary cause, that sectarianism exists everywhere, and to provoke the feelings between fraternal publications.

　　Yu Tian (i.e., Wang Ruowang) launched a vicious personal attack on Comrade Jun Qing in the literary tea party in Wenyi Bao (issue 12), in which he said: "Harvest" editorial board list, his name is also listed before the veteran writers. "Harvest" editorial board list was originally arranged according to the number of strokes of surnames; this is what more careful people can see. But a writer has degenerated to using a pseudonym to make shameless attacks on comrades; even more despicable is that a literary publication has become a tool for flattery in his eyes, judging others by himself, as if everyone in the world is as ugly as him.

　　In the eleventh issue of Wenyi Bao, in Du Lijun's speech "The Writers Association Widely Opens its Doors for Criticism in the Rectification Movement," "Can the Writers Association's publications freely publish works and express opinions like 'Harvest'?" Although there is only one sentence, it implies that "Harvest" is so "free and unrestrained" that any work can be published, and flowers and poisonous weeds can be mixed together; even more, any opinion can be expressed, regardless of whether it is beneficial to socialism, and it can be recklessly expressed. It seems that "Harvest" is not under the leadership of the Party, is not within the revolutionary literary cause, and is a wild flower and weed. On the other hand, it seems that other publications of the Writers Association are so "unfree" that they cannot freely publish works or freely express opinions, and they have turned the Secretariat into the "censors" of the past, who have to review manuscripts. We should affirm that "Harvest" has never been interfered with in the selection and editing of manuscripts, and the Party's leadership and the Secretariat have never reviewed manuscripts. However, the working comrades in the editorial department do go through a review after receiving the manuscripts, at least two people, sometimes all the comrades – five people. We also have to read some manuscripts. If we still can't decide, we will send them to the editorial board comrades to read. In the future, perhaps some manuscripts, when we can't make up our minds, will be automatically sent to the responsible comrades of the Party, so that they can help us and solve the problem for us, but this is not reviewing manuscripts, this is helping us to do a better job in editing. We do this purely because we want to run the publication well, be responsible to the Party, be responsible to the people, and be responsible to the writers. We cannot send harmful works to the readers. The editing comrades of each publication should do this. We are very free, but we cannot abuse our freedom and smuggle in poisonous weeds. What we contribute to the readers will be beneficial spiritual nourishment, otherwise we will be sorry to the people, sorry to the Party, and even commit crimes against the people. We must strictly demand ourselves, and we also ask the Party to strengthen its leadership, mainly to prevent our work from making mistakes. In "Harvest" there are only full and precious grains, which are beneficial to the people. We don't want boundless "freedom," this kind of "freedom" can make people fall into the mud unconsciously.

　　The inaugural issue of "Harvest" has been published. The inaugural message is our opinion, and the works published are in line with the opinions of our inaugural message. Not only the inaugural issue is like this, but it will still be like this in the future. We are to unite the vast number of writers under the leadership of the Party and contribute more fragrant flowers and beneficial food to our beloved motherland, educate the working people with socialist spirit, and encourage the people to sing and advance towards the socialist road!

    写在“收获”创刊的时候
  　巴金　靳以
    1957年7月24日，“收获”创刊号和广大的读者相见了。它的诞生，具体地实现了“百花齐放”的政策，并显示了党的英明的领导，大力的支持和无微不至的关怀。
    在反动派残酷的统治之下，我们所编辑的“文学季刊”“文学月刊”和“文丛”都先后地被扼杀了。那时，我们不但失去了编辑的自由，和许多的作家一样，甚至于也失去了写作的自由；可是在今天，党信任我们，给我们勇气和力量；中国作家协会给我们任务，编一个大型的文学刊物，和其他的兄弟刊物兴起社会主义竞赛，这就足以证明一个文学工作者和编辑工作者，在解放前后的天地悬殊的遭遇了。
    我们还是很热爱编辑工作的，当我们付出了辛勤的劳动，把一本刊物呈献给读者，在那中间，除开成名作家的力作之外更能推荐出发光的新人作品，对于读者、作者和编者都是最大的喜悦。在过去艰苦的环境下，每当印出了一本刊物的时候，我们是感到最大的安慰和又一次的胜利。我们的努力没有落空，我们的愿望实现了，我们没有辜负作家们的期望，我们没有埋没新人的才能，我们贡献给读者一本有益的精神食粮，能使他们增加一分生活和斗争的勇气。
    可是二十年后的今天，当党给了我们这个任务，尽管我们很高兴，可是也有很深的顾虑。读者的要求大大提高了，作家的队伍更无比地壮大，新的作家正像我们祖国的新生事物一样，时时刻刻都在涌现着；我们怀疑那可怜的“老经验”，不足以满足读者的要求，更不能够很好地组织和团结广大的作家们。也就是说，我们不能完成党给我的使命。可是党再次地解除我们的顾虑，为我们解决了一切困难问题，要我们放手做去，同志们更百般地帮助我们。
    于是经过了半年的计划和筹备，“收获”准期出版了。
    在这一段具体工作中，我们深深地体会到没有党的领导、支持与关怀，“收获”就不可能创刊。党不仅给我们精神的鼓舞，还指示我们工作的方向与道路。甚至有许多具体而繁杂的工作，都帮助我们解决了。我们感激党对我们的信任，这增加了我们的责任感，我们必须对党负责，对人民负责，对作家同志们负责。毛主席所提出来的六大标准，是我们工作的指路南针，让我们在任何时候都不致于迷失方向。只有紧紧地依靠党，在党的领导下，我们才能做好编辑工作，才能使“收获”一年年地更丰盛起来。
    在组稿的过程中，我们也深深地认识到，在毛泽东光辉的照耀下，中国作家们的创作劳动是极其旺盛的，在祖国的各个角落里，许多作家在辛勤地劳动着。在创刊号出版之前，我们已经收到了从几万字的中篇到几十万字的长篇六十九件，而且我们还知道有许多作家就将在年内和明年完成他们的巨著。祖国革命文学事业的收获，实在是很大的。在来稿中，我们更看到许多老作家的极其严肃认真的创作劳动和诚恳谦虚的态度。有的老作家的原稿，密密匝匝地写满了蝇头小楷，看得出是经过三番五次的修改。经过两三年写作的时间，还很虚心地要求编辑同志的修改，并诚心诚意倾听广大的读者的意见。有的作家不是埋怨我们发表得太迟了，而是说我们不该把他的作品放在创刊号，为的使其他作家的作品尽快地和读者见面。我们一般是不妄改作家的作品的，即使有意见也是提出来，把原稿寄回给作家请他们自己修改。就是在文章间发现了误书和我们不明了的地方，也一一地详细提出请求作家自己答复。许多作家同志们对我们的工作表示赞许；可是我们所有的编辑部的工作同志们不仅为作家们的创作态度和可贵的品质所感动，并受了深刻的教育，促使我们在编辑工作中要更认真严肃，诚恳和谦虚。
    我们不惮烦地写了这些，就是要以我们深刻的感受和具体的情况来驳斥那些右派分子的无耻谰言：不要党的领导，文学工作和创作的“今不如昔”，作家和编辑间不可消弥的矛盾……
    可是就这样，在“收获”还没有创刊之前，右派分子和有右派思想的人几次三番地利用“收获”别有用心地造谣生事。
    施蛰存就恶意地说因为“文艺月报”有宗派主义，就先分出了一个“萌芽”，又分出了一个“收获”。（大意如此）事实上，“萌芽”的茁长，是为青年文学工作者开辟一个新的园地，因此从编者到作者，差不多都是生气勃勃的青年人。从期期上升的印数和每天大批的来稿看，都说明它受到广大青年读者和作者的欢迎和支持，也说明党的领导是正确的，它的发刊是及时而必要的。“收获”是中国作家协会的刊物，主要是刊登长篇和中篇为主，和“文艺月报”没有任何重复和冲突的地方，只为工作的方便起见，编辑部设在上海而已。右派分子无中生有，造谣生事，不过是企图诬蔑祖国的文学事业，处处存在宗派主义，并挑拨兄弟刊物相互间的感情。
    俞田（即王若望）在文艺报（12期）的文艺茶座中对峻青同志施行恶毒的人身攻击，那中间有一项说到：“收获”编委名单中，其大名亦列于老作家之前。“收获”编委名单，原来是依姓氏笔划排列的；这是较为细心的人即可看出。可是一个作家，堕落到化名对同志做无耻的攻讦；更卑鄙的是，一个文学刊物在他的眼中竟成为吹捧的工具，以己度人，好像天下人都像他一般丑恶。
    在文艺报十一期上，“作协在整风中广开言路”的杜黎均发言中，“作协的刊物是否能像‘收获’那样自由刊登作品，发表意见？”话虽然只有一句，但从这句话里暗示着“收获”竟是那么“自由自在”，“无拘无束”，什么作品都可以登，鲜花毒草可以杂陈；尤有甚者，什么意见都可以发表，不管是否对社会主义有利，可以乱放乱鸣。好像“收获”不受党的领导，不在革命文学事业之内，是一株野花闲草。另外一面，又好像作协其他的刊物竟那么“不自由”，不能自由刊登作品，也不能自由发表意见，竟把书记处说成了过去的“审查官”，要审查稿件。我们应该肯定地说，“收获”在选稿和编辑工作上，从来没有受到任何干涉，党的领导和书记处从来也没有审查过稿件。但编辑部工作同志，在接到稿件之后，确是经过一番审阅，至少是两个人，有时是全体同志——五个人。有的稿件我们也要看过，如果还不能决定，我们送给编委同志看。将来也许有的稿件，在我们拿不定主意的时候，自动地送给党的负责同志看，让他帮助我们，替我们解决问题，但这不是审查稿件，这是协助我们把编辑工作做得更好，我们这样做，纯然因为是要把刊物办好，对党负责，对人民负责，也对作家负责。我们不能把有害的作品送给读者，每个刊物的编辑同志都应该这样。我们是很自由，但我们不能滥用自由，偷运毒草。我们贡献给读者的将是有益的精神食粮，否则我们就对不起人民，对不起党，甚至是对人民犯了罪。我们必须严格地要求自己，我们更要求党加强领导，主要是使我们的工作不犯错误，在“收获”中只有饱满的、宝贵的粮食，对人民是有益的。我们不要无边无涯的“自由”，这种“自由”能使人不知不觉陷入泥坑中去的。
    “收获”创刊号已经出版了，发刊词就是我们的意见，所刊登的作品是和我们发刊词的意见相符合的。不但创刊号如此，今后也还是如此。我们就是要在党的领导之下，团结广大的作家，贡献给我们亲爱的祖国以更多的香花和有益的食粮，以社会主义精神教育劳动人民，鼓舞人民向社会主义大道高歌猛进！
