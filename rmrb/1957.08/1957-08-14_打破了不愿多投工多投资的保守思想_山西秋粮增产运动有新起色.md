Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, August 13th: Various localities in Shanxi Province have paid attention to resolving the ideological problems of agricultural cooperative members, and various production increase activities have made significant achievements.

At the beginning of July, when the autumn grain over-production campaign in Shanxi Province's rural areas had just begun, some agricultural cooperatives that implemented the "three fix and one reward" system of contracting work and output worried that increased investment would increase production costs, and that the income would be relatively reduced, resulting in losses outweighing gains. Furthermore, more labor investment would reduce the value of labor days. Therefore, when arranging the use of labor, they deliberately restricted the attendance of cooperative members, and phenomena such as not purchasing fertilizer, not irrigating, and not cultivating intensively appeared. In order to break this conservative thinking and erroneous practices that hindered grain production, party and government leading departments at all levels promptly organized discussions in agricultural cooperatives, and used accounting comparisons to explain the benefits of investing more labor and capital to cooperative members. After education, the peasants in various localities realized that investing more labor and capital was beneficial to both the country and individuals, and the autumn grain over-production campaign has thus taken on a new look. In Changzhi, Jinan, Yuci, and other places, the attendance rate of cooperative members has generally increased by about 10%, and production investment has also increased significantly.

At present, more than 40 million mu of autumn fields in the province have been hoed two to three times in advance, and the fineness has exceeded that of previous years. The area of topdressing for crops such as millet and corn has been expanded by about one time compared to the original plan. Farmers in the southern region have intercropped corn, millet, and other crops on more than 3 million mu of wheat stubble land. Farmers in the Taihang Mountains and the central region have renovated and planted a large number of small plots of land in front of and behind their residences, along river channels, and in river beaches and ditches. In Xiyang, Wuxiang, Wutai, and more than a dozen other counties alone, more than 130,000 mu of small plots have been planted with late autumn crops such as beans and millet.

    打破了不愿多投工多投资的保守思想
    山西秋粮增产运动有新起色
    据新华社太原13日电　山西省各地注意解决农业社社员的思想问题，各项增产活动有了显著成绩。
    7月初，山西省农村的秋粮超额增产运动刚刚开展的时候，有些推行了“三定一奖励”包工包产制度的农业社顾虑投资多了生产成本加大，收入相对减少，会得不偿失，并且投工多了还要降低劳动日的价值。因此，在安排使用劳力时就故意限制社员出勤，并且出现了不购买肥料、不灌溉、不精耕细作等现象。各级党、政领导部门为了打破这种妨害粮食增产的保守思想和错误作法，及时地组织各地农业社讨论，并用算账对比的方法向社员说明多投工多投资的好处。各地农民经过教育以后，认识到多投工多投资无论对国家和个人都有利无弊，因此秋粮超额增产运动有了新的起色。长治、晋南、榆次等地许多农业社社员的出勤率一般提高了10％左右，生产投资也有显著增加。
    目前，全省四千多万亩秋田都提前锄了两次到三次，精细程度都超过了往年。谷子、玉米等作物的追肥面积都比原来计划扩大了一倍左右。南部地区的农民在三百多万亩麦茬地里复种了玉米、谷子等作物，太行山区和中部地区的农民在住宅前后、河渠沿岸和河滩沟岔间整修和种植了大批小块土地，仅昔阳、武乡、五台等十多个县就有十三万多亩小块地种上了豆类、糜黍等晚秋作物。
