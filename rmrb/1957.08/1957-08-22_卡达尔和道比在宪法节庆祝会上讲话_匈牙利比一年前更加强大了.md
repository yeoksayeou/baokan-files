Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, August 21st: Janos Kadar, Chairman of the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government and First Secretary of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party Central Committee, said on August 20th in Kisujszallas that Hungary has now completely restored constitutional order, and it can be said with confidence that our People's Republic is now stronger than it was a year ago. We have learned great lessons from the events of last October, and we can say with certainty that the unity of the party and the unity within the working class and peasantry have been greatly strengthened compared to the past.

Kadar made these remarks on the 20th while attending the Hungarian Constitution Day celebration held in Kisujszallas. Approximately 100,000 working people participated in the celebration. Istvan Dobi, Chairman of the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic, also attended the meeting and spoke.

Kadar said that the United Nations General Assembly special session, scheduled for September 10th, will discuss the so-called "Hungarian Question" based on the report published by the United Nations Committee. However, this committee has no legal basis to carry out its work, because the United Nations Charter does not grant anyone the right to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.

Kadar said, we are not supporters of arrests and detentions. We want peace, to let the imperialists know that a Hungarian People's Republic exists, where the regime belongs to the people. Domestic enemies should also know that our regime here is a people's regime, we are building socialism, and they should not endanger us.

Kadar said, we also believe that if it is to punish some people so that all the people can live in peace, there is nothing wrong with that.

Kadar then talked about the party. He emphasized that the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party is the social leading force of the Hungarian People's Republic. Workers and peasants must have a unified, revolutionary workers' party; only such a party can lead the country. Communists should always remember: the requirement for the party and party members is not to rule the people, not to put themselves above the people, but to act as a vanguard, teaching and educating the people, and helping them overcome difficulties. Kadar also spoke about the achievements of the national economic recovery work.

Dobi, in his speech at the celebration, talked about the despicable role played by Nagy Imre during the counter-revolutionary riots. He also talked about the mistakes Nagy Imre had made in the past when he served as Minister of Agriculture and Minister of Food.

Kadar and Dobi's speeches were warmly welcomed by those present.

On the eve of Constitution Day, to commemorate and reward the heroes who heroically sacrificed or contributed to defending the people's regime last autumn, the President of the People's Republic and the Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government awarded the "Red Flag Medal," the "Medal for Commemoration of the Worker-Peasant Regime," and the "Distinguished Service" Medal on the 18th to Imre Mezo, former Secretary of the Budapest Municipal Party Committee, as well as more than 200 other military officers, industrial and agricultural model workers, etc.

    卡达尔和道比在宪法节庆祝会上讲话
　　匈牙利比一年前更加强大了
    据新华社布达佩斯21日电　匈牙利工农革命政府主席、匈牙利社会主义工人党中央委员会第一书记卡达尔20日在基苏萨拉什市说，目前匈牙利已经完全恢复了宪法秩序，并且可以满怀信心地说，现在我们的人民共和国比一年前更加强大了。我们从去年十月事件中吸取了很大的经验教训，可以肯定地说，党的团结、工人阶级和农民内部的团结都比过去大为加强了。
    卡达尔是20日参加基苏萨拉什市举行的匈牙利宪法节庆祝大会上讲这番话的。参加这一天庆祝大会的约有十万劳动人民。匈牙利人民共和国主席团主席道比也参加了大会，并且在会上讲了话。
    卡达尔说，定于9月10日召开的联合国大会特别会议，根据联合国委员会公布的报告要讨论所谓“匈牙利问题”。但是，这个委员会没有任何法律根据来进行它的工作，因为联合国宪章没有赋予任何人干涉别国内政的权利。
    卡达尔说，我们并不是逮捕和拘留的支持者。我们希望和平，让帝国主义者知道，有一个匈牙利人民共和国存在，那里的政权是属于人民的。国内敌人也应当知道，我们这里的政权是人民政权，我们在建设社会主义，不应该危害我们。
    卡达尔说，我们还认为，如果是为了全体人民能够安宁地生活，而惩办一些人，那是没有什么不好的。
    卡达尔接着谈到党的问题。他强调说，匈牙利社会主义工人党是匈牙利人民共和国的社会领导力量。工人和农民必须要有一个统一的、革命的工人政党，只有这样的党才能够领导国家。共产党员应该永远记住：对党和党员的要求，不是统治人民，不是把自己放在人民之上，而是作为先锋队，教导和教育人民，帮助他们克服困难。卡达尔另外还谈到了国民经济恢复工作的成就。
    道比在庆祝大会上讲话时谈到了纳吉在反革命暴乱时期所起的卑鄙作用。他还谈到纳吉过去在担任农业部长和粮食部长时所犯的错误。
    卡达尔和道比的讲话受到了到会者的热烈欢迎。
    在宪法节前夕，为纪念和奖励去年秋天在保卫人民政权中英勇牺牲的或有功劳的英雄们，人民共和国主席和工农革命政府18日把“红旗勋章”、“为了工农政权纪念章”和“杰出服务”奖章，奖给了前布达佩斯市委书记麦泽·伊姆莱以及其他二百多名军官、工业、农业模范等。
