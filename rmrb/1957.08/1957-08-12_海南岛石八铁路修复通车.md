The railway is a dedicated line from the Shilu Iron Mine directly to the Basuo seaport. When the Japanese invaders occupied Hainan Island, they built this railway to plunder the island's mineral resources. It was abandoned after the Japanese surrendered. The state began repairing the railway in March last year, and it is now open to traffic. (Image attached)

    海南岛石八铁路修复通车
    这条铁路是石碌铁矿直达八所海港的专用线。日寇侵占海南岛时，为掠夺岛上矿藏修建了这条铁路。日寇投降后，就荒废了。去年3月，国家开始修复这条铁路，现已通车。（附图片）
