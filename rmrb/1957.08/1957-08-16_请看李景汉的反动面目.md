See Li Jinghan's Reactionary Face
    Wang Hao Kou Entian

Under the criticism and exposure of faculty and students of the Renmin University of China, the thorough and deep-seated reactionary nature of rightist Li Jinghan has been revealed.

What kind of person is Li Jinghan after all?

A lackey who "loyally and devotedly" serves American imperialism

Rightist Li Jinghan was cultivated single-handedly by American imperialism. From 1917 to 1924, for nearly seven years, he studied "sociology" at universities in California, San Francisco, and New York in the United States. After returning to China from the United States in 1924, for the twenty-four years until 1948, Li Jinghan had been cultivating lackeys for imperialism and the reactionary ruling class in church schools such as Yenching and Fu Jen Universities and Tsinghua University. During this period, he also served as a food and agriculture statistics specialist at the United Nations, as a domestic situation investigator and investigator in the United States, and as a broadcaster for the "Voice of America" before the Japanese surrender. Not only that, Li Jinghan also once served as an assistant to Gamble, a veteran American cultural spy, conducting so-called "social surveys" in China, and later worked under Yan Yangchu, an American imperialist dog, taking American money to conduct "Ding County social surveys," providing information for imperialist aggression against China.

Zhang-Luo Alliance Restoration

The Vanguard of Bourgeois Social Science

Rightist Li Jinghan is a veteran bourgeois social survey "scholar" in our country. Using this trump card, he launched a frenzied attack on Marxism-Leninism, plotting to restore bourgeois sociology. Li Jinghan's attack was carried out from three aspects. First, he uglified Marxism-Leninism and beautified bourgeois social surveys. He said: "Many historical materialist researchers in our country only study some abstract principles, dry and lacking convincing power based on rich examples," "Chinese sociologists (note: referring to bourgeois sociologists) have always attached the most importance to practical investigation and research," "Sociologists are the best at independent thinking." For this reason, he slandered our social surveys as "one-sided," with only telescopic, comprehensive surveys (referring to learning the Soviet reporting system), and "without" microscopic typical surveys. Second, Li Jinghan said that there are some gaps in Marxist social science, and these gaps should be filled by bourgeois sociology. It should be pointed out that Marxism is a complete system, and there are no gaps. Li Jinghan clamored to fill the gaps in Marxist-Leninist social science, but his essence was to seize positions and territory from Marxism-Leninism, and replace them with bourgeois sociology. Li Jinghan's third attack was what he called "the main object of sociological research is the relationship between various people in society, and the contradictions within the people are actually the social relationships between people, such as leaders and those led, party members and non-party members, the relationship between individuals and collectives, etc. Researching and analyzing these relationships and proposing solutions depends on accurate and in-depth investigation." Obviously, Li Jinghan here has blatantly revealed his conspiracy to usurp the entire Marxist-Leninist position and replace it entirely with bourgeois sociology.

After the Party put forward the policy of "Letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," Li Jinghan believed there was an opportunity and actively participated in the rightist clique of the Zhang-Luo Group to restore bourgeois social science. Colluding with rightists such as Fei Xiaotong, Wu Jingchao, Wu Wenzao, and Pan Guangdan, under the guise of criticizing old sociology, he actively, systematically, and step-by-step plotted to restore bourgeois sociology. By the time of the "Great Blooming and Contending," Li Jinghan's conspiracy activities had developed to a very rampant stage, and he participated in secret meetings everywhere to plot the restoration of reactionary sociology. On June 9, Li Jinghan participated in the "First Meeting of the Preparatory Committee for Sociological Work" secretly held at Chen Da's home and participated in formulating a reactionary program for restoring bourgeois sociology. At this meeting, Li Jinghan also colluded internally and externally, and blatantly placed the social survey and research office of Renmin University, which had not yet been formally established, within their program, as if it had become one of their bases. It can be seen that Li Jinghan is the vanguard of the Zhang-Luo Alliance in restoring bourgeois social science. His conspiracy activities had long been appreciated by the rightist boss Luo Longji. Rightist Pu Xixiu confessed: "Luo Longji told me to find Li Jinghan on sociological issues."

Slandering the Cooperative System

After liberation, Li Jinghan's social surveys were still guided by bourgeois sociological theory. His survey purpose of serving imperialism and the reactionary class has not changed at all. Last year, he conducted a survey in the suburbs of Beijing and wrote a booklet called "The Past and Present of Farmers' Lives in the Suburbs of Beijing" (the People's Daily published a part of it). In this booklet, he did everything possible to provoke and slander the cooperative system. In the article, Li Jinghan maliciously fabricated rumors, saying: "Cooperatives are not free, and the meaning of this lack of freedom can be understood but is difficult to express. ... For example, if some members need to engage in a little household sideline, they may be criticized, interfered with, and even labeled as selfish and spontaneous. ... Some members who have a little surplus money are often mobilized to 'consciously and voluntarily' invest, but some mutter behind their backs." "Some people feel that since joining the community, they have not been able to get time that they can fully control all year round. Sometimes they need to take care of some personal affairs at home, but they can't find time to deal with them. Long-term intensive labor and occasional surprise tasks are really hard to bear. ... It made me feel that people think it is wrong to treat people as beasts of burden in the past, but today, it is sometimes inappropriate to treat people as tractors."

Muttering at the Communist Party, Hostile to the New Society

Rightist Li Jinghan not only attempted to restore reactionary bourgeois sociology, but also, like all rightists, launched a frenzied attack on the Party's ideological remolding movement for intellectuals.

In the rectification movement, Li Jinghan, in his speech at a symposium for non-party members convened by the school's Party committee, used all the most vicious words of the rightists to slander and attack the Party's leadership, uglify Party members, and try his best to provoke the relationship between the Party and intellectuals, and negate the ideological leadership of Marxism-Leninism. Li Jinghan openly and bitterly scolded the Party as: "Holding Marxist-Leninist books in his left hand and Soviet weapons in his right hand" to treat intellectuals, "requiring Party members to have more humanity." Since liberation, Li Jinghan has been resisting ideological remolding in various movements. He believes that the Party's ideological remolding of old intellectuals is not only "disrespectful of human rights," but also a kind of "insult" and "forced confession." He also slandered that the reason why the Party wanted to conduct ideological remolding of old intellectuals was "afraid of them rebelling." He said: "The Party has the army, navy, and air force, so what are you worried about?" "Scholars rebel, and it will not succeed in three years. It is even impossible to even fantasize about rebelling." The implication is that the Party does not need to remold intellectuals. Why is Li Jinghan so hostile to the Party's remolding of intellectuals? Look at his own words: "It is easy to win the country, but it is difficult to govern it; it is easy to capture cities, but it is difficult to capture hearts; it is even more difficult to capture the hearts of senior intellectuals." He also said: "Old intellectuals not only have merits in academics, but also have a certain level in politics." Therefore, he warned the Communist Party: "There is an old Chinese saying, 'Water can carry a boat, but it can also overturn it,' which is worth pondering." It can be seen that Li Jinghan's purpose and attempt are very obvious, that is, to deny that the Party can lead intellectuals, and to deny that intellectuals have the need for remolding, thereby provoking the relationship between intellectuals and the Party.

Li Jinghan also maliciously described the relationship between the Party and the masses as the "Great Wall," saying that it was built by the Communist Party alone. How does he want the Party to demolish the Great Wall? He said: "Today, the Party not only needs to wash the dust on its face, but also needs to wash its face, and it should swallow the soap into its stomach to wash it." Even more viciously, he wants the Party to "lay down the butcher knife and become a Buddha on the spot." Isn't Li Jinghan's position of hating the Party very obvious?

Li Jinghan also arrogantly slandered Marxism-Leninism. In his view, bourgeois social science is "much better" than Marxism-Leninism. He said: "Even if an old bear plays old tricks, it is more unique than a new bear playing for one or two years." Isn't this saying that capitalism is much better than socialism? Take a look at his own words and you will understand better. He said: "Before the adjustment of departments, the number of times I laughed was less than one or two percent compared with the past." Why did the number of times he laughed in the new China under the leadership of the Communist Party decrease so much? And why was he so happy under the rule of the Kuomintang? What social system Li Jinghan likes, isn't it already very clear? It can be seen from the above that Li Jinghan is very hostile to the Communist Party and everything in the new society, and what he misses is the feudal and capitalist system.

After the anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiracy of rightist Li Jinghan was exposed, not only did he not bow his head and confess his guilt, but he also tried his best to quibble and continue to resist, playing shameless tricks. He tried every means to dilute his serious problems, pretending to be a "victim," saying that he was "used" by the rightists and "influenced" by the rightists' remarks.

We once again solemnly warn rightist Li Jinghan that your anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiracy activities are objective facts that cannot be quibbled. Do not persist in evil and cut yourself off from the people.

    请看李景汉的反动面目
    汪浩  寇恩田
    右派分子李景汉，在中国人民大学师生的批判和揭发下，他的透彻骨髓的反动本质暴露了出来。
    李景汉究竟是怎样的一个人呢？
    “忠心耿耿”为美帝国主义服务的奴才
    右派分子李景汉是由美帝国主义一手豢养起来的。从1917到1924年的近七年中，在美国加里福尼亚、旧金山、纽约等地的大学读“社会学”。1924年李景汉从美国回国后至1948年的二十四年间，一直是在燕京、辅仁等教会学校和清华大学为帝国主义、反动统治阶级培养奴才。在此期间内并在联合国内担任粮食、农业统计专员，在美国担任过美国国内情况调查专员和调查员，在日本投降前还担任过“美国之音”的广播员。不仅如此，李景汉还一度担任过美国老牌文化特务甘博尔的助手在中国进行所谓的“社会调查”，以后又在美帝国主义的走狗晏阳初的手下拿着美国人的钱搞过“定县社会调查”，为帝国主义侵略中国提供资料。
    章罗联盟复辟
    资产阶级社会科学的急先锋
    右派分子李景汉，在我国是一个老牌资产阶级社会调查“学者”。他用这张王牌，向马列主义展开猖狂进攻，阴谋复辟资产阶级社会学，李景汉的进攻是从三方面进行的。首先他丑化马列主义，美化资产阶级社会调查。他说：“目前我国的许多历史唯物主义研究者，只是研究一些抽象的原则，干巴巴地缺少根据丰富事例的活生生说服力”，“中国社会学者（注：指资产阶级社会学者）一向是最重视实际调查和研究的”，“社会学者是最善于独立思考的”。为此，他诬蔑我们的社会调查是“片面”的，只有望远镜式的全面概括的调查（即指学习苏联的报表制度），而“没有”显微镜式的典型调查。其次，李景汉说，马克思主义社会科学有一些空白，而这些空白要让资产阶级社会学来填补。应该指出，马克思主义是一个完整体系，并没有什么空白，李景汉叫嚷着要来填补马列主义社会科学的空白，其实质就是要一个阵地、一个阵地的夺取马列主义领土，而以资产阶级社会学取而代之。李景汉的第三方面进攻，就是他所说的“社会学所研究的主要对象，就是社会上各种人与人之间的关系，而人民内部的矛盾，事实上也就是人与人的社会关系，如领导与被领导，党员与非党人士，个人与集体的关系等。研究分析这些关系，提出解决的办法来，则有赖于精确深入的调查”。很显然，李景汉在这里已露骨地道破了他要篡夺整个马列主义阵地的阴谋，全部由资产阶级社会学来代替。
    在党提出了“百家争鸣、百花齐放”的方针之后，李景汉认为有机可乘，就积极地参加了章罗集团恢复资产阶级社会科学的右派小集团。与右派分子费孝通、吴景超、吴文藻、潘光旦等勾结在一起，在批判旧社会学的合法外衣之下，积极地，有计划有步骤地阴谋复辟资产阶级社会学。到“大鸣大放”时期，李景汉的阴谋活动就发展到了十分猖狂的地步，他到处参加密策复辟反动社会学的座谈会。6月9日李景汉参加了在陈达家里密开的“社会学工作筹备委员会第一次会议”，并参与订定出恢复资产阶级社会学的反动纲领。在这个会上李景汉还里应外合地，明目张胆地把人民大学尚未正式成立的社会调查研究室放在他们的纲领之内，俨然成为他们的基地之一了。可见，李景汉是实现章罗联盟恢复资产阶级社会科学的急先锋。他的阴谋活动早已得到右派头子罗隆基的赏识，右派分子浦熙修曾招认说：“罗隆基告诉我，关于社会学问题叫我找李景汉。”
    诬蔑合作化制度
    解放后李景汉的社会调查，仍以资产阶级社会学理论为指导。他为帝国主义，为反动阶级服务的调查目的一点也没有改变。去年他在北京郊区作了一次调查，回来后写了一本小册子，名叫“北京市郊区农民生活的过去和现在”（人民日报曾发表了其中一部分），在这个小册子里，他对合作社制度极尽挑拨、诬蔑之能事，李景汉在文章中，恶毒造谣说：“合作社不自由，这个不自由的含意是可以体会而难以言传的。……例如有的社员需搞点家庭副业，说不定会招来批评、干涉，甚至被扣上自私自利和自发的帽子。……有点儿富裕钱的社员，往往被动员‘自觉自愿’投了资，可是有的却在背地里嘟囔着”。“有人感觉自入社以来，一年到头得不到能够完全自由支配的时间，有时需要办点家里的私事，也找不出时间来处理，长时期的紧张的劳动和不时的突击任务，真够呛的……使我发生了一种感想：人们认为过去把人当牛马是不对的，而今天却有时把人当拖拉机用，是不是欠妥”。
    谩骂共产党，敌视新社会
    右派分子李景汉不仅企图复辟反动资产阶级社会学，而且和一切右派分子一样，向党的知识分子思想改造运动展开了猖狂的进攻。
    在整风运动中李景汉在学校党委召开的党外人士座谈会上的发言，使用了右派分子一切最恶毒的字眼来诬蔑和攻击党的领导，丑化党员，极力挑拨党与知识分子的关系，否定马列主义的思想领导，李景汉公开的切齿谩骂党是：“左手拿着马列主义书本，右手拿着苏联武器”来对待知识分子，“要求党员多一些人性。”解放以来李景汉在各次运动中一直是抗拒思想改造的，他认为党对旧知识分子的思想改造，不仅是“不尊重人权”，而且是一种“侮辱”，是“屈打成招”，还诽谤党之所以要对旧知识分子进行思想改造是“怕他们造反”，他说：“党掌握有陆海空军，还有什么不放心的呢？”“秀才造反，三年不成。甚至连想造反的幻想都不可能”。言下之意就是说党对知识分子不必改造了。李景汉为什么如此敌视党对知识分子的改造呢？请看看他自己的话吧：“打天下容易，治天下难；攻城容易，攻心难；攻高级知识分子的心更难”。他还说： “旧知识分子不但在学术上有可取之处，就是在政治上也有一定高度”。因此，他警告共产党说：“中国有一句古话，‘水能载舟，亦能复舟’，这句话很可玩味”。可见，李景汉的目的和企图是很明显的，那就是否认党能够领导知识分子，否认知识分子有改造的必要，从而挑拨知识分子与党的关系。
    李景汉还恶意的把党群关系形容成“万里长城”，说是由共产党一手筑成的。他要党怎样拆长城呢？他说：“于今党不但要洗脸上的灰尘，需要洗脸，更应该把肥皂吞到肚子里去洗一洗。”更恶毒的是他要党“放下屠刀，立地成佛”，李景汉这种仇视党的立场难道不是很明显吗？
    李景汉还狂妄的诬蔑马列主义，在他看来，资产阶级社会科学比马列主义“好得多”，他说：“即使老狗熊耍的是旧把戏，也比一、二年的新狗熊耍的独到得多”。这难道不是在说资本主义比社会主义好的多吗？再看看他自己的话就更加明白了，他说：“院系调整前，我笑的次数与过去比，不到百分之一、二”。为什么他笑的次数在共产党领导下的新中国竟少到这样呢？又为什么在国民党统治下他是那么高兴呢？李景汉喜欢的是什么社会制度，不是已经很清楚了吗？从以上可以看出，李景汉对于共产党，对于新社会的一切，都是十分仇视的，他所留恋的是封建、资本主义制度。
    右派分子李景汉的反党反社会主义阴谋被揭穿后，他不但不低头认罪，反而百般狡赖，继续顽抗，耍起无耻的花招。他想尽一切办法把自己的严重问题冲淡一些，装成一个“被害者”，说他是被右派“利用”了，受了右派分子言论“影响”。
    我们再一次正告右派分子李景汉，你的反党、反社会主义阴谋活动，是客观存在的事实，是狡赖不掉的，不要怙恶不悛，自绝于人民。
