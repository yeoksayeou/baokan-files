At the first Guangdong Province Excellent Teachers Conference, which closed on the 23rd, eight teachers from different schools were five generations of teachers and students. Their gathering became a celebrated story at the conference.

These five generations of teachers are Li Yuanjing, Chen Jiaji, Zeng Xianshu, Wu Juekeng, Mo Bingguang, Wang Fuzhou, Fu Mingfa, and Liang Qican. When they gathered together, everyone felt that this meeting was valuable, but not accidental. On the way to Guangzhou, they all had such a premonition: among the province's excellent teachers, they would surely meet teachers who had given them profound and positive influences during their student days. These eight teachers each have their own strengths, and they have a common advantage: being hardworking, simple, and dedicated.

Li Yuanjing, sixty-six years old, is the first generation of these five generations of teachers and students. He is one of the most respected teachers in Huiyang County. He has persisted in his education position for forty-two years, being responsible for his work, humbly learning from others' strengths, repeatedly studying teaching materials, patiently teaching students, and caring for students' learning and life like a loving father. Students and colleagues admire him very much. This old teacher, who had been in the countryside and rarely went out, was particularly happy to see that his several generations of students had become excellent teachers. He encouraged the students to uphold the position of excellent teachers and take on the responsibility of serving the people.

Chen Jiaji, Li Yuanjing's student, is also an old teacher with thirty-five years of teaching experience and gray hair. He is the principal of Kaiqiao Middle School in Kaiping County. He not only works very hard in teaching and administrative work, but he also often leads students to weed and clean the campus, keeping the school clean and tidy. Whether in the hot summer or the cold winter, he is always the first to run to the playground to exercise, which encourages many young students to cheer up and persist in physical exercise.

When the eight teachers gathered to chat, Chen Jiaji's students Zeng Xianshu, Wu Juekeng, Mo Bingguang, Fu Mingfa, etc. recalled the situation when they were in school. They all said that Principal Chen Jiaji had a profound influence on them. Principal Chen's spirit of getting up early and going to bed late, leading by example, and teaching tirelessly has always been their example, encouraging them to move forward. Zeng Xianshu then added: "I not only have such good teachers as Li Yuanjing and Chen Jiaji, but also such good students as Wang Fuzhou." This led to a speech by Wang Fuzhou, a teacher from Hainan Jiaji Middle School sitting next to him, he said: "I guessed that my teachers would be elected as representatives of excellent teachers, because they have contributed their life's vitality to the people's education and made achievements; I did not expect that my student Liang Qican and I would also be elected."

From the relationship between Li Yuanjing and Liang Qican, people can see the glorious significance of being a people's education worker, just as Chen Jiaji said at the end of the conversation: The seeds sown many years ago have blossomed and borne fruit; these seeds will be passed on from generation to generation, and will also bloom more beautiful flowers from generation to generation.

    五代优秀教师欢聚一堂
　　新华社记者　刘晓生　何剑萍
    在23日闭幕的广东省第一届优秀教师会议上，有八位来自不同学校的教师是五代的师生。他们的欢聚，在会上传为佳话。
    这五代教师是李元经、陈家骥、曾宪书、伍觉铿、莫炳光、王茀周、符明发、梁启灿。当他们欢聚在一起的时候，大家都感觉到这一次的会见是可贵的，然而也不是偶然的。在来广州的途中，他们彼此都有这样的预感：在全省的优秀教师中，必将会遇到在自己学生时代给了自己深刻而又良好影响的教师。这八位教师各有所长，并且有一个共同的优点，那就是：艰苦朴素、勤勤恳恳、埋头苦干。
    六十六岁的李元经，是这五代师生中的第一代，他是惠阳县最受人尊敬的教师之一，他四十二年如一日地坚持教育岗位，对工作负责，虚心学习别人的长处，反复钻研教材，对学生循循善诱，像慈父般关怀着学生的学习和生活，学生和同事都很敬佩他。这位过去一直在乡下很少出门的老教师，今天看到自己的几代的学生都成了优秀教师，感到特别高兴。他勉励学生们要坚持优秀教师立场，负起为人民群众服务的责任。
    李元经的学生陈家骥，也已经是白发斑斑，有了三十五年教龄的老教师。他是开平县开侨中学校长，他不仅在教学行政工作上非常努力，他在学校里还经常带领学生在校园除草、打扫，把学校收拾得干净、整齐。无论在酷热的夏天或严寒的冬天，他总是第一个跑到操场上锻炼身体，这样使许多青年学生都跟着振作起来，经常坚持体育锻炼。
    在八位教师欢聚畅谈时，陈家骥的学生曾宪书、伍觉铿、莫炳光、符明发等回忆起当时上学的情景，他们都说，陈家骥校长对他们的影响是很深的，陈校长从前起早睡晚，以身作则，诲人不倦的精神，一直成为他们的榜样，鼓舞着他们前进。曾宪书接着还说：“我不单有李元经、陈家骥那么好的老师，还有像王茀周那样好的学生。”这样一来就引起了坐在旁边的海南嘉积中学教师王茀周的一段话，他说：“我猜中我的几位老师们一定会当选为优秀教师代表的，因为他们都把毕生的生命力贡献给人民教育事业，作出了成绩；我却没有想到我和我的学生梁启灿也当选了。”
    从李元经到梁启灿的关系上，人们可以看到作为人民教育工作者的光荣的意义，正如陈家骥在结束那次谈话时说的：多少年前播下的种子都开花结果了；这些种子一代一代地传播下去，也将一代一代地开出更美丽的花朵来。
