    The Individual and the Collective
    Lao She
    These past few days, I have participated in several enlarged Party group meetings of the Chinese Writers Association discussing the anti-Party activities of Ding Ling and Chen Qixia. This has made me realize what kind of person Ding Ling is.
    She harbors the ambition of "I am the literary world," never forgetting her dream of being enthroned. She is one of the leaders of the Writers Association, one of the leaders of the literary world. The Party values her, and everyone respects her. However, within the Writers Association and the literary world, she undermines unity and engages in factionalism. Truly, hidden arrows are the hardest to guard against. We hate such treacherous people!
    Ding Ling is a veteran Party member, but she has always wanted to stand above the Party. The Party is the savior of the Chinese people, and everyone is grateful. Ding Ling's behavior not only isolates her from writers but also isolates her from the people unless she immediately bows her head to admit her guilt and repent. Yes, Ding Ling has received the Party's education after all, and she should know how not to abandon herself.
    However, judging from her attitude in her speeches at the meetings these past few days, she still adopts the posture of "I am the literary world," using flowery words and refusing to honestly explain her problems, only making lyrical monologues, attempting to gain everyone's pity and understanding with beautiful rhetoric and tearful performances. We are not fools and will not be deceived again. Tell the truth, Ding Ling!
    When she speaks, she still claims to be standing on the Party's position. We do not accept such deception and insult. If she still refuses to confess the ugly things she has done, then she is still continuing to oppose the Party. What position can she speak of? If there is one, it can only be Ding Ling's individualistic position. Ding Ling, are you really willing to abandon yourself to the end?
    Yes, Ding Ling is the embodiment of bourgeois individualism. From the materials revealed by everyone, we can summarize her "spiritual outlook"—I am everything, and everything is for me. No matter how much the Party values her and gives her high positions, she will never be satisfied, always feeling that the Party is leading her instead of her controlling the Party. Therefore, she is bound to oppose the Party. She wants everyone to be her servants, not allowing anyone to go against her will, so she woos this one, attacks that one, exhausting her efforts, finding cracks to lay maggots, thinking herself extremely clever! Furthermore, the more everyone values her, the more she thinks that nothing can be done without her, so she dares to make trouble, making trouble whenever she sees an opportunity, believing that final victory will belong to her. This is a strange logic, but individualists consider it normal.
    Such an extreme individualist could have climbed very high in the Kuomintang era and become a tyrant. In a socialist society, such ambitions are bound to fail. There is democracy in the Party, but it will never tolerate the domineering style of a self-proclaimed autocrat. The Writers Association is under the leadership of the Party and does not allow anyone to sit on a high throne, ruling alone. Six hundred million people are joyfully engaged in labor for the collective cause of socialism, and the free market of individualism must be abolished. Ding Ling, you see, your little cleverness has harmed you. Your eyes only look at your own nose and do not see the distance. You are a writer, a socialist writer, but you only calculate your own interests all day long, forgetting the brightness and ideals of socialism. To yourself, this is so ugly; to society, this is so dangerous! Tell the truth, only by digging out the roots of your individualism and cleansing your soul can you see socialism. The Party and the writers inside and outside the Party are willing to save you. Whether you are willing to start anew depends entirely on your own decision.
    Thank you to the Party group of the Writers Association for inviting me to participate in the enlarged Party group meeting to discuss the anti-Party activities of the Ding Ling and Chen Qixia group! I have been educated. I see clearly how bourgeois individualism is an obstacle to socialism, and Ding Ling's crimes are a concrete example. I hope that Ding Ling will repent and start anew, and I earnestly hope that writers will always remember: only by putting the socialist collective cause first, not the individual, can we sincerely accept the leadership of the Party and make the literary and artistic cause flourish!

    个人与集体
    老舍
    这几天我参加了几次中国作家协会讨论丁玲、陈企霞反党活动的党组扩大会议。这使我认识了丁玲是何等样人。
    她抱着“朕即文坛”的野心，寝食不忘龙袍加身。她是作协的领导人之一，文艺界的领导人之一，党重视她，大家敬重她。可是她却在作协与文艺界里面，破坏团结，搞小集团，真是暗箭最难防。我们恨这样阴险的人！
    丁玲是老党员，可是一向想站在党的上边。党是中国人民的救星，人人感激。丁玲的行为不但自绝于作家，也自绝于人民，除非她马上低头认罪，悔过自新。是的，丁玲究竟受过党的教育，她应当晓得如何不自暴自弃。
    可是，由她这几天在会议上发言的态度上来看，她还是依旧以“朕即文坛”的姿态，花言巧语，不老实交代问题，仅作抒情的独白，企图以美好的修辞，声泪俱下的作派，邀得大家的惋惜与谅解。我们不是傻子，不再受骗；说真的吧，丁玲！
    她发言的时候，还口口声声自称是站在党的立场上。我们不接受这样的欺哄与侮辱。现在还不肯坦白自己作过的丑事，便仍然是继续反党而已，有什么立场可言？若是有的话，只能是丁玲的个人主义的立场。丁玲，你真甘心自暴自弃到底吗？
    是的，丁玲就是资产阶级个人主义的化身。由大家揭发的材料里，可以总结出她的“精神面貌”——我是一切，一切为我。不管党怎样器重她，给她多么高的地位，她总不会满足，总嫌党领导她，而不是她操纵党。因此，她势必反党。她愿一切人作她的臣仆，不容任何人拂逆她的意旨，所以她拉拢这个，攻击那个，费尽苦心，见缝下蛆，自以为聪明绝顶！还有，大家越器重她，她就越以为凡事没她就办不通，所以她敢闹，见机会就闹，认定最后的胜利必属于她。这是奇怪的逻辑，可是个人主义者却以此为正常。
    这样极端的个人主义者，在国民党的时代可能爬得很高，成为一霸。在社会主义社会里，这种野心定难得逞。党里有民主，但决不容忍唯我独尊的恶霸作风。作协受党的领导，不许任何人高踞宝座，称孤道寡。六亿人民为社会主义的集体事业兴高采烈地从事劳动，个人主义的自由市场必须取缔。丁玲，你看，你那点小聪明却害了你。你的眼只看着自己的鼻子，而没有看看远处。你是个作家，社会主义的作家，却一天到晚只盘算私利，而忘了社会主义的光明与理想。对你自己说，这多么丑恶；对社会说，这多么危险！说真话吧，只有挖净你的个人主义的根子，洗清你的灵魂，你才能看见社会主义。党与党内党外的作家都愿救你，肯不肯从新作人可全凭你自己决定。
    感谢作协党组邀我参加党组扩大会议，讨论丁、陈集团的反党活动！我受了教育。我看清资产阶级个人主义怎样是社会主义的障碍，丁玲的罪行即是具体的例证。我希望丁玲改过自新，我切盼作家们都时刻不忘：不是把个人，而是把社会主义集体事业，摆在第一位，才能诚心诚意地接受党的领导，使文艺事业蒸蒸日上！
