After the universities and colleges started their summer vacation, the Rightists among the teachers who are members of democratic parties have been taken over by the respective democratic parties to continue the struggle. Meetings have been held separately in the past two days. All seven major hospitals in the city held meetings on the 5th to criticize the Rightist fallacies of Yang Jishi and others.

    本报讯　天津市反右派斗争继续深入开展。全市宣传、文教、政法、财贸、工业等系统和各区所属单位，在最近两天内召开了一百多次反右派斗争会议，仅财贸系统在5、6两天就开了大小会议三十次，民主党派在5日听了中共中央统战部长李维汉的讲话以后，当晚就召开了会议，研究今后进一步深入开展反右派斗争的问题。高等学校放暑假后，教师中的右派分子是民主党派成员的，已由各民主党派负责继续进行斗争，这两天已分别举行了会议。全市七个大医院都在5日开了会议，批判了杨济时等人的右派谬论。
    各区的反右派斗争进展很快，右派分子大都陷入重围，据几个区不完全统计，已有四分之一的右派分子低头认罪。　（新华社专稿）
