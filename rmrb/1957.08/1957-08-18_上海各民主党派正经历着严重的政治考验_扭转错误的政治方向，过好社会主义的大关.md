Shanghai, 16th. Our reporters Ji Yin and Xi Ping comment on the rectification movement of Shanghai's democratic parties: The six democratic parties in Shanghai – the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), the China Democratic League (CDL), the China National Democratic Construction Association (CNDCA), the China Association for Promoting Democracy (CAPD), the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party (CPWDP), and the Jiusan Society of Shanghai – have universally launched a rectification movement with the struggle against the rightists as the primary task. This political and ideological socialist revolution represents a particularly severe political test for the leaders and all members of Shanghai's democratic parties.

A considerable proportion of right-wing elements are among the leading cadres of these parties.

The anti-rightist struggle of Shanghai's six democratic parties is the main battlefield of this struggle in Shanghai for more than two months, because the situation here is indeed much more serious than in other sectors of Shanghai. Many revealed materials have shown that not only is the number of right-wing elements particularly large here, but it is also worth noting that right-wing elements account for a considerable proportion of the leading cadres who hold real power in the organizations at all levels of these parties. These people have used their leading positions within the parties to unscrupulously change the political direction of these organizations, making them tools for opposing the Party and opposing socialism, which makes the problem even more serious. Judging from the municipal-level organizations of each party, it can be said that the municipal-level leading bodies of Shanghai's democratic parties all have problems, but to varying degrees. The most serious is the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League. In the past period, the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League was completely controlled by right-wing elements such as Chen Renbing and his ilk, becoming a major base for anti-Party activities in Shanghai. The Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, led by Xia Gaoyang and Wu Miaonian, the director and deputy director, also became an anti-Communist and anti-people propaganda department. For a period of time, they actually replaced the CPWDP Municipal Committee in issuing orders. In the RCCK Municipal Committee, an anti-Party clique of Chen Mingshu has been found. Among those involved in the Municipal Committee leadership are Zhao Jishun, Deputy Secretary-General and Director of the Organization Department of the Municipal Committee, Wu Yiyu, Deputy Director of the Municipal Committee, and Lu Jingqing, a member of the Municipal Committee Standing Committee, and the investigation is continuing. Right-wing elements have also been found in the Municipal Committee members and some responsible persons of the Jiusan Society, the CAPD, and the CNDCA, and the situations are similar.

Some grassroots organizations have also been occupied by rightists.

The district-level leading bodies and grassroots organizations of Shanghai's six democratic parties also have considerable problems. Taking the RCCK in Shanghai as an example, it has now been preliminarily ascertained that among the chairmen or vice-chairmen of the RCCK district committees in the Tilanqiao District, Putuo District, Xuhui District, and Yangpu District, many leading figures in the right-wing camp have been found. In the grassroots organizations, it has also been found that the leadership of a small number of branches has been infiltrated or occupied by right-wing elements, resulting in political turmoil during the "blooming and contending" period this year. Some have even been reduced to tools of right-wing groups and right-wing anti-Party activities. The Jiusan Society branch of the Shanghai Fisheries College, the CPWDP branch of the Cultural Publishing House, the CAPD branch of Caoyang Middle School, and the CDL branches of the Shanghai Film Studio and the Shanghai People's Art Theater are all cases with relatively serious circumstances. For example, in the Jiusan Society branch of the Fisheries College, most of the members, from the branch chairman to the branch committee members, were right-wing elements. The branch chairman, Dai Qixin, gathered a group of "thugs" and was determined to drive all the Communist Party members and activists out of the college. Dai Qixin proposed that not only should "big bureaucrats" be opposed, but also "small bureaucrats" and all the Communist Party's "claws" and "remnants." This Jiusan Society branch of more than 20 people was established at an astonishing speed in the fierce struggle to drive away the Communist Party Committee Secretary of the college. They were using the name of the democratic parties to engage in anti-Communist and anti-people activities, and the banner of the democratic parties was tarnished by them.

Unscrupulous development, gathering large and small right-wing figures in society.

The existence of right-wing elements in Shanghai's democratic parties has a long history, and many people were right-wing elements during the bourgeois democratic revolution. However, the sudden expansion of right-wing forces is the result of some political careerists actively "gathering strength" in the past year. Since the second half of last year, under the guidance of the Communist Party Central Committee's policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," and with the help of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee, the leadership of Shanghai's democratic parties has actively carried out activities to develop organizations and strengthen ties with various sectors of society, and the membership of each party has greatly increased. This kind of large-scale development is the general trend and is also necessary. However, right-wing elements took this opportunity to play a trick of "switching the sky," ostensibly implementing the policies proposed by the Communist Party, but actually completely adopting the methods of bourgeois political parties, turning the development of organizations into a means for them to expand their strength and accumulate political capital. Right-wing elements spared no effort in this large-scale development, using various despicable and dirty means of "recruiting followers." Competition and infighting among themselves were also extremely fierce. Chen Renbing of the China Democratic League put forward the slogan "Eight Immortals cross the sea, each showing their own talents," and Xia Gaoyang of the CPWDP put forward the slogan "Actively develop, fight for every inch of land." As a result of the large-scale development, the number of members of Shanghai's democratic parties rose sharply like a mercury column under the scorching sun. The China Democratic League expanded from 900 people to more than 3,400, the Jiusan Society from more than 160 people to more than 1,400, and the RCCK from 450 people to 1,890 people. The membership of the six democratic parties has expanded several times. But the problem is not entirely in the quantity, because most of these people are good people who can be and should be educated. The problem is that right-wing careerists played a set of political tricks under the slogan of "opening the door to the backward," and at the same time, they also recruited many people who were dissatisfied with the Party, had historical stains and had been punished, and even those who had been found to have serious counter-revolutionary crimes, so that these large and small right-wing figures who were originally scattered in society and had no organization were gathered under the banner of the democratic parties. Right-wing generals Xu Zhongnian, Xu Junyuan and others joined the party at this time. It has now been confirmed that their activities to develop these people were planned.

Shanghai's right-wingers have historically had inextricable links with Beijing's right-wing leaders.

The rampant nature of right-wing elements in Shanghai's democratic parties is not a strange thing, and it has deep social roots and specific historical reasons. Shanghai was once the most developed city in capitalism. Although capitalist ownership has basically been destroyed today, the bourgeoisie and the upper petty bourgeoisie are still a large social class, and capitalist ideology and influence are particularly strong. This is the best soil for the growth of bourgeois rightists. During the "blooming and contending" period, this class resonance was very obvious. Another aspect worth noting is that Shanghai's bourgeois rightists and right-wing leaders such as Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Chen Mingshu, and Zhang Naiqi have historically had inextricable links. These links had once loosened in a period after liberation, but in recent years, these links have been restored and developed with the rise of their political ambitions. Shanghai has become the most important strategic base in the minds of Beijing's right-wing leaders, and they have all come to Shanghai to engage in activities, seek out targets, and expand their influence with great efforts. During the "blooming and contending" period in May this year, Chen Mingshu personally rushed to Shanghai to search for his former henchmen and build a conspiracy group headed by Luo Haisha and Yu Ruonan. Some important anti-Party activities in Shanghai's democratic parties are almost closely linked to the anti-Party activities of Beijing's right-wing leaders. Every right-wing clique has a line to Beijing. This is an important feature of the activities of right-wing elements in Shanghai's democratic parties.

In summary, it can be seen that it is extremely necessary for Shanghai's democratic parties to launch a rectification movement centered on the anti-rightist struggle to extinguish the anti-Party wildfire of the right-wing elements and completely reverse the wrong political direction. Moreover, due to the seriousness of the situation, this struggle will inevitably require great efforts and extremely fierce fighting to achieve a complete victory. The anti-rightist struggle will be the main key and decisive step in the rectification movement of Shanghai's democratic parties. Only by winning the victory in the anti-rightist struggle can the rectification of each party achieve a thorough victory and achieve healthy development in the future. Shanghai's democratic parties have now established new institutions to lead the rectification, and people who are loyal to the cause of socialism have launched a face-to-face struggle against right-wing elements. Chen Renbing and Peng Wenyin of the China Democratic League Municipal Committee, Xia Gaoyang of the CPWDP Municipal Committee, and others have been exposed, and hidden right-wing elements have been singled out one by one. The struggle is gradually expanding and deepening.

Further overcome the right-leaning thought of sentimentalism and prevent impatience; carry out the struggle in depth.

However, judging from the current progress of the rectification movement of Shanghai's democratic parties, there are two issues that deserve attention. One is to further overcome the right-leaning thought of sentimentalism and to prevent impatience. The main danger at present is the former. Each party has this manifestation, and the Jiusan Society and the CAPD have more. The Jiusan Society Municipal Committee recently reviewed its past weak and ineffective struggle against right-wing backbone Wang Hengshou, which is welcome. People hope that they, especially the leaders of each party, can stand up straighter and join the struggle. Secondly, mobilizing the masses, especially the middle masses, is also a problem. Shanghai's democratic parties have not done enough to mobilize the middle masses. Attention has been paid recently, but more work needs to be done. Promoting the anti-rightist struggle to all grassroots organizations and enabling the 13,000 members of the democratic parties in the city to participate in this rectification is a practical step that urgently needs to be taken to further mobilize the masses.

    上海各民主党派正经历着严重的政治考验
    扭转错误的政治方向，过好社会主义的大关
    本报上海16日电  本报记者季音、习平评述上海各民主党派的整风运动说：上海市的六个民主党派——民革、民盟、民建、民进、农工、九三上海的组织，已经普遍展开了以反右派斗争为首要任务的整风运动，这个政治上与思想上的社会主义革命，对于上海民主党派的领导人和全体成员来说，正意味着一次特别严重的政治考验。
    这些党派的领导骨干中，右派分子占相当大的比重
    上海六个民主党派的反右派斗争，是上海两个多月来这一斗争的主要战场，这是因为这里的情况确实要比上海其它阶层严重得多。许多揭发出来的材料已经说明，这里，不仅右派分子的数量特别多，值得注意的是，在这些党派的各级组织中掌握实权的领导骨干，右派分子占着相当大的比重。这些人利用了他们在党派内部的领导地位，肆无忌惮地改变了这些组织的政治方向，使它成了反党反社会主义的工具，这就使得问题具有了更加严重的性质。从各党派的市级组织来看，上海各民主党派的市级领导机构可以说都有问题，只是程度不同，其中最严重的是民盟市委。在过去一段时期中，民盟市委的领导权完全为右派分子陈仁炳之流所掌握，成为上海反党活动的一个大本营。上海农工民主党的市委宣传处，在正副处长夏高阳、吴淼年率领下，也变成了一个反共反人民的宣传处。有一个时期他们实际上还代替着农工市委在发号施令。民革市委中，已经查出了一个陈铭枢的反党小集团，市委负责人中牵连到的已有市委副秘书长兼组织处长赵继舜，市委副主任委员吴艺玉、市常委陆晶清等人，现在正继续追查中。九三、民进、民建市委在市委委员和部分负责人中，也都查出了右派分子，情况大同小异。
    有些基层组织也被右派占领
    上海六个民主党派的区级领导机构和基层组织，问题也不小。以上海民革为例，现在已初步查明，提篮桥区、普陀区、徐汇区、杨浦区的民革区委主任委员或副主任委员中，都发现不少右派阵营中的头、二号人物。基层组织中，也发现有少数支部的领导被右派侵入或占领，以致在今年的鸣放期间政治上一度发生纷乱，有的甚至沦为右派集团和右派反党的工具。九三水产学院支部，文化出版社农工支部，曹阳中学民进支部，上海电影制片厂、上海人民艺术剧院民盟支部等等都是情节比较严重的。如水产学院的九三支部，从支部主委到支部委员，大部分是右派分子，支部主委戴岂心聚集了一批“打手”，一心要把共产党和积极分子全部赶出学院。戴岂心提出：不但要反掉“大官僚”，还要反掉“小官僚”，和一切共产党的“爪牙”和“余孽”。这个二十多人的九三支部是在赶走该院的共产党党委书记的激烈斗争中，以惊人速度建立起来的，他们是借民主党派之名，进行反共反人民之实，民主党派的旗帜被他们玷污了。
    不择手段地大发展，把社会上的大大小小右派人物汇集了起来
    上海民主党派中右派分子的存在，由来已久，不少人在资产阶级民主革命时期就是右派。但是右派力量的突然膨胀，却是最近一年中一些政治野心家们积极地“聚集力量”的结果。从去年下半年起，上海各民主党派的领导上，根据着共产党中央提出的“长期共存、互相监督”的政策，在中共上海市委的帮助下，积极地开展了发展组织，加强与社会各阶层联系的活动，各党派成员有了很大增长，这种大发展是大势所趋，也是需要的。但右派分子却趁此机会，来了个“偷天换日”的把戏，表面上是执行共产党提出的政策，实际上则完全搬出了资产阶级政党的一套，把发展组织变成了他们扩大实力和积累政治资本的手段。右派分子对这次大发展真是不遗余力，施出了各种卑鄙龌龊的“拉伕”手段。相互之间的竞争、倾轧也极为激烈。民盟陈仁炳提出的口号是“八仙过海，各显神通”，农工夏高阳的口号是“积极发展，寸土必争”。大发展的结果，使得上海各民主党派成员的数量，就像烈日底下的水银柱似的急剧上升。民盟从九百人扩展到三千四百多人，九三从一百六十余人发展到一千四百多人，民革从四百五十人发展到一千八百九十人。六个民主党派的成员都扩展了几倍。但问题还不全在于数量，因为这中间的大部分人毕竟还是好人，是可以教育和应当对他们进行教育的。问题在于右派野心家在“向落后开门”的口号下玩了一套政治骗术，同时把许多对党不满的、历史有污点被处过刑的、甚至已查明有严重反革命罪行的人，也搜罗入党，使这些本来分散在社会上的没有组织的大大小小的右派人物，在民主党派的旗号下集合了起来。右派勇将徐仲年、许君远等人，就是在这时候入党的。现在已证实，他们发展这些人的活动都是有计划进行的。
    上海的右派同北京的右派首脑，在历史上就有千丝万缕的联系
    上海民主党派中右派分子的这种猖獗，并不是一件怪事，它还有深远的社会根源和具体的历史原因。上海曾是一个资本主义最发达的城市，虽然资本主义的所有制今天基本上已经被摧毁，但是资产阶级和上层小资产阶级仍然是一个庞大的社会阶层，资本主义思想和影响尤其浓厚。这正是资产阶级右派得以生长的最好土壤。在大鸣大放期间，这种阶级的共鸣就表现得很明显。值得注意的另一方面是：上海的资产阶级右派和章伯钧、罗隆基、陈铭枢、章乃器等右派首脑，在历史上就有千丝万缕的联系，这种联系在解放后一个时期内曾经松弛过，但近年来这种联系随着他们政治野心的抬头，又恢复并且发展了。上海成了北京右派首脑心目中最重要的战略基地，他们都以极大的力量到上海来活动，物色对象，扩张势力。陈铭枢在今年5月的大鸣大放期间，还亲自赶到上海，搜罗旧日的爪牙，建成了一个以罗海沙、余若南为首的阴谋集团。上海民主党派中的一些重要反党活动，几乎都是和北京右派首脑的反党活动紧紧相连的，每一撮右派都有一条通向北京的线，这是上海民主党派中右派活动的重要特点。
      综上所述，可见上海民主党派开展一个以反右派斗争为中心的整风运动，来扑灭右派的反党野火，彻底扭转错误的政治方面，这是极有必要的；而且由于情况的严重，这个斗争必然要花极大的力量，经过极激烈的搏斗，才可能彻底取胜。反右派斗争将是上海各民主党派整风运动的主要关键和决定性的步骤，只有取得反右派斗争的胜利，才可能使各党派的整风获得彻底的胜利，并在今后获得健康的发展。上海各民主党派现在都成立了领导整风的新机构，忠实于社会主义事业的人们已面对面地对右派分子展开了斗争，民盟市委的陈仁炳、彭文应，农工市委的夏高阳等人都已被揭露了，隐藏的右派分子也一个个地被揪了出来，斗争正在逐步地扩展和深入中。
    进一步克服温情主义，防止急躁情绪；把斗争深入开展下去
    但从目前上海民主党派整风运动的进展情况来看，有两个问题值得注意。一个是进一步克服温情主义的右倾思想，以及防止急躁情绪问题。这个问题，目前主要危险是前者，各党派中都有这种表现，九三、民进更多些。九三市委最近曾检讨了他们过去对右派骨干王恒守的斗争软弱无力，这是值得欢迎的。人们希望他们，特别是各党派的领导人员能更硬起腰杆来，投入斗争。其次，发动群众，特别是中间群众，也是个问题。上海各民主党派对中间群众的发动还很不够，最近已有注意，但还需要作更多的工作。把反右派斗争深入推广到所有的基层组织里去，让全市民主党派的一万三千个成员都能参加这次整风，这是目前进一步发动群众所迫切需要着手的一个实际步骤。
