In the Days of Youth Gathering from All Countries
By Our Correspondent Li He

In Moscow, youth from all countries of the world are engaging in various contacts these days: artistic appreciation, sports competitions, meetings between delegations, as well as meetings of regional youth, meetings of professional youth, and discussions among students from various countries... These extensive contacts will undoubtedly promote the friendship and solidarity of youth on five continents, and will enhance their understanding of peace and their determination to defend peace.

Arab Youth Are of One Mind

On August 4th, Arab youth from various countries gathered at the Scientists' Club. Egyptian representative Adel Taher said in his speech: "Youth are the future of the world. Future generations will prove through their actions that the evils that are still encountered today will never be allowed to happen again." An Iraqi representative said that Arab people should be particularly friendly recently because these countries are in danger of colonial enslavement. Representatives from Tunisia, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Sudan, and Morocco enthusiastically discussed the issues that concern Arab countries. They unanimously condemned the imperialists who brought darkness to the lives of the Arab people and expressed the Arab people's desire for friendship with the Soviet Union. The speeches of these representatives were repeatedly interrupted by the cheers of Arab youth, both male and female, who love independence. An Algerian girl sang: "...We are soldiers of Algeria, we defend our motherland." Everyone sang along. The Arab youth's hearts in striving for unity, freedom, and independence are united.

Common Language of European Youth

The next day, in the same venue, at the suggestion of the French and Italian delegations, youth from nineteen European countries gathered together. The table of the presidium was adorned with the flags of twenty-eight European countries. Representatives from France, Italy, Belgium, Poland, Hungary, the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, the Federal Republic of Germany, Spain, and Switzerland spoke enthusiastically. Time was short, and there were many European issues. Where should the discussion begin? Italian representative Egoli proposed the following scope: friendly cooperation among all European countries; increased contact between European countries; elimination of European military blocs, and advocating peaceful negotiations to resolve all issues; opposing the establishment of foreign military bases on one's own territory; and supporting disarmament and the ban on hydrogen bomb testing. People exchanged opinions on these issues. The unification of Germany is a central issue related to friendly cooperation among European countries. Due to the obstruction of Western countries, this issue has become one of the most difficult to resolve in the world. In fact, the people of East and West Germany who yearn for unification can talk to each other very well. A West German youth, who did not want to be named, said at the meeting: We support the proposal on German unification, regardless of whether this proposal is put forward by the Soviet Union or by capitalist countries.

The meeting finally passed a resolution saying: European youth are dissatisfied with the current situation in Europe and hope to see the people of European countries live peacefully and harmoniously.

The Pen Must Serve Peace

Among the meetings of youth from various industries, the meeting of journalists is particularly noteworthy. Because nearly eight hundred journalists from newspapers, magazines, radio, film and television from fifty countries came to participate in the festival. This does not include the numerous foreign journalists stationed in Moscow and Soviet journalists. More than two thousand journalists have registered with the festival press center. With so many journalists, and their viewpoints being so different, a major debate could easily break out at the meeting. However, in the two days of meetings, although the hall of the Journalists' Club was packed, no major debate occurred. This is not only because the journalists are busy with their work, but probably also because the atmosphere of the entire festival is not conducive to cold warriors.

Soviet journalist and editor-in-chief of "Komsomolskaya Pravda," Adzhubei, criticized Western publications at the meeting for distorting the materials of Soviet newspapers and inciting discord among people of various countries. He said: "We should make the pen, this weapon, always serve peace and friendship."

Guy Baba, a representative from Black Africa, spoke about the suffering of the African people. He denounced some foreign journalists for only seeking novelty in Africa and portraying Africa as lacking culture. He said: "Many of our young men have decided to become journalists to correctly report on the lives of the people. We say: We have our own culture, and after getting rid of colonialism, we can develop our culture and catch up with other peoples.

Future Youth Must Be Well Educated

Children are the youth of the future, and educating children well is the foundation for establishing the qualities of youth. The meeting of children's workers is one of the most interesting meetings. Children's workers from Hungary, the German Democratic Republic, Japan, Argentina, Czechoslovakia, Norway, Bulgaria, New Zealand, Mexico, Romania, China and other countries participated in the meeting.

Lecoeur, a counselor from the French "Counselor Association," talked about the importance of older people setting an example. Dien was a counselor of the "Counselor Association" before he was arrested. Marti, who is now in jail, is also a counselor. He was arrested for refusing to serve in the ranks of the fascist general who killed his father. The revolutionary spirit and patriotism of these people inspire the children. The "Counselor Association" in Marseille invited four Algerian teenagers in the summer, collected travel expenses for them, and arranged for them to rest. A newspaper issued a message that an Algerian girl could not go to Paris for medical treatment due to family poverty. The counselors conducted a fundraising campaign and saved the girl's life.

Representatives from various countries are very interested in the work of the Soviet Young Pioneers. Krasnova, secretary of the Central Committee of the Belarusian Communist Youth League, introduced the labor education of the Young Pioneers. Many foreign representatives felt the great concern of socialist society for children.

Debates Clarify Right and Wrong

Representatives from sixty-one countries held a lively international discussion meeting for law students in the classrooms of Moscow State University on Lenin Hills. When people with different ideas come into contact with current international law issues, disputes naturally arise.

Why can aggressive groups ignite conflicts in Asia and Africa? Why are so many people still oppressed by colonial countries? Where has the United Nations gone at these times? Is there something wrong with the UN Charter that needs to be revised? Most people believe that the UN Charter is being undermined by the United States, and the problem is not revision but compliance. Many representatives expressed indignation at the fact that China's legitimate status in the United Nations has not yet been restored.

British student Lipor raised the so-called "Hungarian issue" and wanted to attack socialist countries. Hungarian student Kovacs used eyewitness facts to prove how counter-revolutionaries, supported by Western countries, attempted to turn Hungary into a source of new wars. He said: In those difficult days, the Hungarian people hoped that the United Nations would stop the imperialist countries' conspiracy to subvert Hungary, but the United Nations did not do so.

People responded to the fallacy of British student Nalot with loud laughter. He said: "Britain is not a communist country, but it cannot be called a capitalist country either. Britain was indeed a colonial country in the nineteenth century. But now there is a completely different colonialism in the world. I call it democratic colonialism." British student Walker came out to refute this fallacy. He said: "Our hands are stained with the blood of many people we have oppressed. When British youth put on military uniforms and are forced to shoot Cypriots, suppress people's uprisings, and fight against the Arabs, what moral basis do our youth have?" This voice of justice was warmly welcomed by the participants.

    在各国青年欢聚的日子里
    本报记者  李何
    在莫斯科欢聚的世界各国青年连日进行着多种多样的接触：艺术的观摩，体育的比赛，代表团之间的会见，还有地区青年的会见、专业青年的会见、各国学生的讨论会……。这些广泛的接触无疑地将促进五大洲青年的友谊和团结，将提高他们对和平的认识和保卫和平的斗志。
    阿拉伯青年一条心
    阿拉伯各国青年8月4日在科学家俱乐部会师。埃及代表阿得尔·塔赫尔发言说：“青年是世界的未来。未来的人们以自己的事业证明，今天还遇得到的坏事将永远不许重演。”伊拉克代表说，近来阿拉伯人民应当特别友好，因为这些国家受着殖民地奴役的危险。突尼斯、约旦、黎巴嫩、叙利亚、苏丹、摩洛哥的代表们踊跃地谈论阿拉伯各国所担心的问题，他们一致痛斥给阿拉伯人民带来了黑暗生活的帝国主义者，表示阿拉伯人民和苏联友好的愿望。这些代表们的发言，一再被阿拉伯青年男女们热爱独立的欢呼所打断。一位阿尔及利亚少女唱道：“……我们是阿尔及利亚的士兵，我们保卫着祖国。”大家跟着唱起来。阿拉伯青年争取团结、自由、独立的心是齐一的。
    欧洲青年的共同语言
    第二天，在同一场所，根据法意两国代表团的建议，欧洲十九国青年聚会一堂。主席团的桌子上插着欧洲二十八国国旗。法、意、比、波、匈、苏、德意志民主共和国、德意志联邦共和国、西、瑞士的代表都热情地说了话。时间短促，欧洲问题很多，意见从何谈起呢？意大利代表埃果里提出了这样的范围：一切欧洲国家的友好合作；增加欧洲各国之间的接触；消除欧洲的军事集团，拥护和平谈判解决一切问题；反对在本国领土上建立别国的军事基地；拥护裁军和禁止试验氢弹。人们就这些问题交换意见。德国的统一是关系欧洲国家友好合作的中心问题，这个问题由于西方国家作梗，它变成世界上最难解决的问题之一。其实，渴望统一的东西德人民自己之间是很好说话的。一位不愿公布姓名的西德青年在会上说：我们支持关于德国统一的建议，不管这个建议是由苏联还是由资本主义国家提出的。
    会议最后通过决议说：欧洲青年不满欧洲现状，希望看到欧洲各国人民和平和协调地过活。
    笔杆要为和平服务
    在各业青年的会见中，新闻工作者的会见很受人注目。因为有近八百个报刊、广播、电影和电视的新闻记者从五十个国家来参加联欢节。这还不包括为数众多的常驻莫斯科的外国记者和苏联新闻工作者。向联欢节新闻处登记的记者在二千人以上。记者这么多，而他们的观点又极不相同，一场大争论很可能在会见时爆发。但在两天会见中，虽然记者俱乐部的厅子里座无虚席，大的争论并没有发生。不只因为记者们忙于工作，大概也因为整个联欢节的气氛不利于冷战者吧。
    苏联新闻工作者、“共青真理报”总编辑阿祖贝在会上指责西方刊物歪曲苏联报纸的材料，挑拨各国人民之间不和的行为。他说：“我们应该使笔杆这个武器永远为和平与友谊服务。”
    黑人非洲代表加伊·巴巴说了非洲人民的苦难。他斥责某些外国记者在非洲只是猎奇，把非洲说成没有文化。他说：“我们许多青年男子决定要成为新闻工作者，正确地报道人民的生活。我们说：我们有自己的文化，而且在摆脱殖民主义之后，我们能够发展文化，赶上别国人民。
    未来的青年要教育好
    儿童是未来的青年，教育好儿童就是打好青年品质的基础。儿童工作者的会见是最有意思的会见之一。参加会见的有匈牙利、民主德国、日本、阿根廷、捷克斯洛伐克、挪威、保加利亚、新西兰、墨西哥、罗马尼亚、中国等国家的儿童工作者。
    法国“辅导员协会”的辅导员列球尔谈了年长者以身作则的重要性。狄恩在被捕以前是“辅导员协会”的辅导员。现在坐牢的马尔提也是辅导员，他是因为拒绝到杀害他父亲的法西斯将军的队伍中服役而被捕的。这些人的革命精神和爱国主义气概，感召着儿童们。马赛港的“辅导员协会”夏天邀请了四位阿尔及利亚少年，为他们收集旅费，安排休息。有一家报纸发出了一条阿尔及利亚女孩子因家贫不能到巴黎就医的消息。辅导员们就进行募捐，救了这个女孩子的生命。
    各国代表对于苏联少先队的工作很感兴趣。白俄罗斯共青团中央书记克拉斯诺娃介绍了少先队员的劳动教育。许多外国代表感到社会主义社会对儿童的巨大关怀。
    争论辨明是非
    六十一国代表在列宁山上莫斯科大学课堂里举行了活跃的法科学生国际讨论会。思想不同的人们接触到当前国际法问题，自然发生争论。
    为什么侵略集团得以在亚非点火呢？为什么许多人民还受着殖民国家的压迫呢？联合国在这些时候跑到那里去了？是不是联合国章程有毛病，需要修改呢？大多数都认为，联合国章程受到美国的破坏，问题不在于修改而在于遵守。对于至今不恢复中国在联合国的合法地位这件事，许多代表都表示愤慨。
    英国学生列波尔提出了所谓“匈牙利问题”，想攻击社会主义国家。匈牙利学生科瓦奇以亲眼目击的事实，证明受西方国家支持的反革命如何企图把匈牙利变为新战争的策源地。他说：在那些困难的日子里，匈牙利人民希望联合国阻止帝国主义国家颠复匈牙利的阴谋，但是联合国没有这样做。
    人们以哄堂大笑报答英国学生纳洛特的谬论。他说：“英国不是共产主义国家，但也不能叫做资本主义国家。英国在十九世纪确是殖民国家。但现在世界上存在着完全另外的殖民主义。我叫它做民主的殖民主义。”英国学生沃克出来驳斥这个谬论。他说：“我们的手上染有许多被我们压迫的人民的血迹。当英国青年穿上军衣，被逼去射杀塞浦路斯人，去镇压人民的起义，去和阿拉伯人作战的时候，我们的青年有什么道德的基础可言。”这个正义的声音受到与会者的热烈欢迎。
