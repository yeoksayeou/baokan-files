　　Good News from the Grain Front
　　　　Anhui Province
    ◇By the 17th, Anhui Province had procured 1,007 million catties of summer grain, completing the state's summer grain procurement plan. It is estimated that summer grain procurement may exceed the state plan by 15% to 20%, approaching the figure stipulated by the province due to the bumper summer harvest to strive for procurement. After socialist propaganda and education, the farmers of Anhui Province, especially the farmers of Huaibei, the main wheat-producing area, recalled the enormous support the state gave them during the difficult days of natural disasters in the years since liberation, and thus further recognized the correct relationship between the state and the individual. They accelerated the progress of selling summer grain, and did not stop selling even during the tense stage of flood control. In particular, the farmers of Woyang and Yingshang counties have exceeded the targets for striving for procurement set by the province. (Yu Feng)
    Suzhou Special District, Jiangsu
    ◇Socialist education in Suzhou Special District has achieved preliminary results. As of August 8, the total amount of summer grain procured and stored in the entire special district reached 245,552,000 catties, exceeding the state-prescribed summer grain procurement task by 16%.
    In the previous period, capitalist thought was extremely rampant in Suzhou Special District. All counties vigorously carried out socialist education in the countryside. Through debates on issues such as whether unified purchase and sales are good, and whether farmers should sell grain to support national construction, capitalist ideas were criticized by the majority of the masses, and the counter-revolutionary words and deeds of landlords and rich peasants were attacked. The situation of slow grain procurement was quickly reversed, and a wave of grain delivery formed everywhere. Many grain purchasing stations were busy from dawn to dusk. (Wang Shunbao)
　　　　Linzhang County, Hebei
    ◇By August 3, Linzhang County, Hebei, had overfulfilled the summer grain procurement task. On July 18, only 86.9% of the procurement plan had been completed. After carrying out socialist education throughout the county, farmers have formulated plans to save grain. Some places proposed that Party members and League members take the lead in selling an extra ten catties of grain, and the masses save five catties of grain per household, and finally successfully completed the procurement task.

　　粮食战线上的捷报
          安徽省
    ◇安徽省到17日已征购夏粮十亿零七百万斤，完成了国家的夏粮征购计划。估计夏粮征购可能超过国家计划15％到20％，接近于省里因夏粮丰收而规定的争取征购的数字。安徽省农民特别是小麦主要产区的淮北农民，经过社会主义宣传教育以后，回忆了解放几年来，在他们遭受自然灾害的困难的日子里，国家对他们的巨大支援，因而进一步认识了国家和个人的正确关系。他们加快了交售夏粮的进度，在防汛的紧张阶段都没有停止交售，特别是涡阳、颍上两县的农民，都超额完成了省里所规定的争取征购的指标。　（于风）
    江苏苏州专区
    ◇苏州专区的社会主义教育已经收到初步成果。到8月8日止，全专区征购入库的夏粮共达二亿四千五百五十二万斤，超额16％完成了国家规定的夏粮征购任务。
    苏州专区前一时期资本主义思想极为泛滥。各县大张旗鼓地向农村进行社会主义教育。通过对统购统销好不好；农民应不应该卖粮支援国家建设等问题的辩论，资本主义思想受到大多数群众的批判，地主、富农的反革命言行受到了打击，粮食征购迟缓的局面也很快扭转，各地送粮形成热潮。许多粮食收购站，从黎明到黑夜，收购工作忙个不停。　（王顺保）
      河北临漳县
    ◇河北临漳县到8月3日止，已超额完成夏粮征购任务。7月18日，只完成征购计划86.9％。经过在全县范围内进行社会主义教育，农民纷纷制定节约用粮计划。有的地方提出党员、团员带头多卖十斤粮、群众每户节约五斤粮，最后顺利完成了征购任务。　（郭桐）
