The communiqué stated that the talks were conducted in a friendly and harmonious atmosphere. The talks demonstrated both sides' desire to strengthen cooperation and showed that their assessments of the international situation were very similar.

The President and the Chairman noted with satisfaction that further strengthening friendly relations and developing cooperation is in the interests of both countries and the cause of international cooperation. They expressed their belief that the efforts of both countries to build socialism and improve the lives of their people are creating broad possibilities for the development of comprehensive cooperation and are a source of beneficial exchange of experiences. They believe that cooperation between the two countries in this regard will contribute to the socialist construction of both countries and also to the development of the entire socialist cause.

In order to develop this relationship, they also decided to make arrangements for mutual visits of personnel and exchange of information, with a view to ensuring increased understanding and discovering the best forms for effective cooperation.

When discussing the situation in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam after the Geneva Conference, the Yugoslav President praised the contributions made by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to the cause of peace and international understanding through its consistent efforts to implement the Geneva Accords. Both the President and the Chairman emphasized that adhering to the implementation of the Geneva Accords is in the interests of the Vietnamese people and also meets the requirements for peace in the Far East and easing existing tensions in the world.

The President and the Chairman noted with satisfaction that the starting point of the two countries' foreign policies lies in seeking world peace and strengthening international trust and cooperation.

The President and the Chairman both believe that the only way to ensure world peace is to develop cooperation between all countries on the basis of equality, respect for independence and integrity, non-interference in internal affairs, and mutual benefit. In striving to achieve this goal, socialist countries can make special contributions by developing cooperation and international activities among themselves based on the principles of complete equality in their relations and creatively solving the social and international problems facing humanity today. Therefore, both the President and the Chairman expressed the firm determination of the two countries to further strengthen the peaceful and constructive policies of their governments in order to overcome the contradictions that currently exist in the world and to build trust between countries.

The President and the Chairman believe that solving the disarmament issue is very important. The President and the Chairman firmly believe that steps must be taken immediately to stop nuclear testing. It is absolutely necessary to prohibit the use of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction that kill people. Nuclear energy should be used entirely for peaceful purposes to benefit humanity.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh invited President Tito to pay an official visit to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. President Tito gladly accepted the invitation.
