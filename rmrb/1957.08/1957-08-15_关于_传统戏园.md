    Concerning "Traditional Theaters"

    "A theater imitating the form of traditional theaters is about to meet audiences in Beijing. This theater will follow the performance style of the theatrical stage twenty years ago, canceling the currently used curtains and replacing them with 'old-fashioned' side curtains; restoring 'table setting,' 'clearing the stage,' 'the God of Fortune performance,' 'auspicious plays,' 'curtain lifting,' 'stagehands,' 'refreshments,' 'throwing cushions,' 'sparklers,' 'tea selling inside the theater'..."
          (June 24, "Guangming Daily")

    Twenty years ago, I almost visited every theater in Beijing. What impressed me most were the "Sanqing," "Qingle," "Huale," "Guanghe Lou," and other theaters outside Qianmen. The square stage with pillars was already uncomfortable to look at; the hard seats without legroom were even more unbearable. Once the performance started, the search for seats, the fight for seats, and the addition of seats would cause a ruckus for quite some time. As soon as you sat down, the waiter would come: "Do you have tea leaves?" Later, tea would be served, and then the waiter would come again countless times to refill the water; after a while, the cigarette seller would pass by, the dried tofu seller would pass by, the sugarcane seller would pass by…; towels would fly over the audience's heads; when the play reached its climax, the ticket collector would arrive. On the stage, before the opening, the stagehands would be busy setting up the central military tent and four armchairs, and then, as soon as the performance started, they would remove them, spending a lot of time without any clear purpose. "Clearing the stage" was deafeningly loud; the more you wanted it to end, the longer it went on. After "clearing the stage," there would first be a lengthy and meaningless "God of Fortune performance." The first act had to be some kind of "Eight Hundred and Eighty Years," "Longevity Chart," or other "auspicious play," as if the performance was not for the audience to enjoy but specifically for the actors to "pray for blessings." During the performance, there were too many redundant staff on stage. When the young lady left her boudoir, the staff would lift the curtain for her; Liu Bei could totally order the staff to move a seat for Kongming; even the poorest dilapidated cottage had staff serving tea and providing kneeling cushions. Especially in summer, a shirtless man would appear in the royal palace to fan the empress. It was truly bizarre and full of strange things.

    The shortcomings of this kind of old theater are obvious: chaotic, making it impossible to concentrate on listening to and watching the play. Since the "Hundred Flowers" campaign, it is said that as many as 50,000 traditional plays have been excavated, which is great. But even restoring such old theaters, I don't think it's necessary!

    关于“传统戏园”
    “一个仿效传统戏园形式的剧场，将要在北京和观众见面。这个剧院将按照二十年前戏曲舞台上的演出情况，取消现在所用的布幕，在舞台左右换上‘守旧’；恢复‘摆台’‘打通’‘跳加官’‘吉祥戏’‘挑帘’‘检场’‘饮场’‘扔垫子’‘撒火彩’‘场内卖茶’……”。
          （6月24日“光明日报”）
    二十年前的北京戏园，差不多我都一一恭临过，最令人难忘的莫如前门外的“三庆”“庆乐”“华乐”“广和楼”等几家戏园，方形带柱的舞台，看着已不舒服；没法搁膝盖头的硬席座位，更叫人难受。戏已经开了锣，台底下找座儿的、争座儿的、加座儿的，得吵嚷个老半天。你刚一落座，茶房来了：“您带着叶子吗？”等会送茶，又来一趟，续开水又不知若干趟；一会儿，卖香烟的经过、卖豆腐干的经过、卖大段甘蔗的经过……；手巾在观众脑袋上头飞来飞去；戏演到高潮，收票的来了。再说台上，开锣之前，检场的忙着摆设中军大帐、四把交椅，开了锣，马上又撤去、费了半天事，不知目的何在？“打通”是吵得人耳朵欲聋，你越希望它早点完，它越没完。打完通，先得跳半天毫无内容的“加官”。头一出，又必须是什么“八百八年”“百寿图”之类的“吉祥戏”，好像演戏不是给观众欣赏，而是专门为艺人“祈福”似的。在演出过程中，台上的冗员太多，小姐出绣房，工作人员给挑帘子；刘备完全可以命令工作人员给孔明搬一个座儿，再穷的破瓦寒窑，也有工作人员伺候茶水和供应跪垫。特别是夏天，皇宫内院会出现一位打赤膊的给娘娘打扇子。真是光怪陆离，无奇不有。
    这种旧戏园的缺点是显然的：杂乱，使人不能专心听戏和看戏。百花齐放以来，据说挖掘出传统剧目达五万个之多，这很好。但连这样的旧戏园也要恢复了，我看没有必要吧！
