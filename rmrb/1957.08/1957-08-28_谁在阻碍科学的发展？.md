　　Who is Hindering the Development of Science?
    Rightist elements clamor: "The Party cannot lead science," "Laymen cannot lead experts," "The Party hinders the development of science"... Is this true? Let's take a look at the facts of the East China Agricultural Science Institute!
    Lin Tiqiang, an assistant researcher in the Agricultural Machinery Department and a Communist Party member, overcame various difficulties and achieved great success in researching and manufacturing rice transplanters. However, rightist elements such as Jiang Yao, the director of this department, tried every possible means to obstruct and sabotage him. They used all kinds of despicable and shameless methods to attack and suppress Lin Tiqiang, calling him a "bumpkin" without culture, deleting his research topics, giving him difficult problems to embarrass him, and denying his research results, saying that the model he made was "useless"... Even after an on-the-spot demonstration, they stubbornly ignored him, refusing to admit their failure and Lin Tiqiang's success. This kind of despicable face of closing their eyes to the facts, arguing sophistically, and calling black white, is no different from the faces of the rightists exposed everywhere.
    Here we also see with what kind of indomitable and fearless spirit this person, who had not received higher education and was insulted as a "bumpkin," painstakingly researched, invented, and created. Those who thought they had culture and understood science believed that "Italy has been researching for decades without success" and wanted to cancel this research. Their meaning is, people have researched for decades without success, how can you do it? This kind of tone full of foreign worship and servility is no different from those foreign slaves who think everything is good in America and Britain.
    What is even more shameful is that after their conspiracies failed and Lin Tiqiang's efforts finally succeeded, these rightist elements turned around and stole the fruits of his labor, credited it to themselves, and shamelessly wrote articles and gave reports everywhere, pretending to be "scientists"!
    Who is hindering the development of science, and who is treating scientific undertakings with a truly scientific attitude, is there any need to explain further?

### 谁在阻碍科学的发展？

　　谁在阻碍科学的发展？
    右派分子叫嚣：“党不能领导科学”，“外行不能领导内行”，“党阻碍了科学的发展”……是不是这样呢？让我们看一看华东农业科学研究所的事实吧！
    农具系助理研究员共产党员林体强，这个没有受过高等教育的人冲破种种困难，研究制造水稻插秧机得到很大的成就；而这个系的主任蒋耀等右派分子却千方百计进行阻挠破坏。他们用尽了各种卑鄙无耻的手段，打击压制林体强，骂他是“土包子”没有文化，把他的试验课题删去，给他出难题为难他，不承认他的研究结果，说他制造的模型“没有用”……甚至经过当场表演，他们仍然顽固地不加理睬，不承认自己的失败，不承认林体强的成功。这种闭眼不看事实，强词夺理，将黑说白的卑劣嘴脸，和各地所揭露出的右派嘴脸，毫无二致。
    这里我们还看到，这个没受过高等教育、被人辱骂为“土包子”的人，是以怎样一种不屈不挠的大无畏的精神，在那里苦心钻研发明创造；而那些自以为有文化懂科学的人，却认为“意大利研究几十年都不成功”，要取消这项研究。他们的意思就是说，人家研究几十年都不成功你还能行？这种充满崇外思想和奴才气的语气，和那些一切都是美、英的好的洋奴相，又有什么两样？
    更为可耻的是，这些右派分子当自己的阴谋诡计失败、林体强的努力终于获得成功之后，他们转而窃取人家的劳动果实，算在自己的账上，厚颜无耻地到处去写文章、作报告，俨然一副“科学家”的面孔！
    究竟谁在阻碍科学的发展，谁是以真正的科学态度来对待科学事业，难道还需要再加说明么？
