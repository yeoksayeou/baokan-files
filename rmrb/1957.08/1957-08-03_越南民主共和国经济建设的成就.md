Achievements of Economic Construction in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam
Zhang Yisheng

In 1956, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam formulated and began to implement its first annual economic plan. Since the ceasefire in Indochina, the economic recovery and construction work of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has made great achievements, paving the way for North Vietnam to move towards socialism.

The Recovery and Development of Agricultural Production

The area north of the 17th parallel in Vietnam has approximately two million hectares of arable land, of which over 90% is paddy fields, with a pre-war annual output of about three million tons. In 1939, the year with the highest output, the area of paddy fields used was 1.84 million hectares, the sown area was 2.24 million hectares (multiple cropping index of 121.7), and the annual rice production was 2.45 million tons (rice yield per hectare was 13.3 quintals). Converting this at a 70% milling rate, the annual paddy production was 3.5 million tons (paddy yield per hectare was 19 quintals, with an average yield of 15.6 quintals per hectare for single-season rice). During the war, the cultivated area and output were greatly reduced. After the ceasefire, due to the emphasis placed by the Vietnam Workers' Party and the government on combining land reform with production, focusing economic recovery mainly on agriculture, especially grain production, and vigorously promoting the mutual aid and cooperation movement; due to the greatly increased enthusiasm of the liberated farmers; due to the restoration and expansion of the irrigation system, more than 100,000 hectares of wasteland were reclaimed, and progress was made in flood and drought prevention, improved seeds, and improved farming techniques; therefore, although North Vietnam also encountered serious droughts, floods, and typhoons in the past two years, grain crops still yielded successive bumper harvests. In 1956, the sown area of ​​crops (including cash crops) was 2.85 million hectares, the sown area of ​​grain crops (including miscellaneous grains) was 2.76 million hectares, and the sown area of ​​paddy rice was 2.28 million hectares (the area of ​​paddy fields used was 1.82 million hectares, with a multiple cropping index of 125.3). The total grain output was 5.12 million tons, the paddy output was 4.13 million tons, the paddy yield per hectare was 22.8 quintals, and the average yield of single-season rice was 18.1 quintals per hectare, all of which set new record highs. This tremendous achievement in agricultural production not only enables the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to ensure that the people of the North are spared from the threat of historical famine, but also has surplus grain to assist the people of the South and for export after reserves are built up. This achievement is also a strong guarantee for future national economic development.

The Total Value of Industrial Output Reached a Post-War Peak in 1956

During the colonial rule, Vietnam's light and heavy industries were very backward. Although the industry in North Vietnam was slightly more developed than in the South, it was damaged during the war, and many factories and mines reduced or stopped production. Despite this, the speed of resuming production in the original factories and mines was still very fast. At the beginning of the takeover of the Hong Gai coal mine, the monthly coal production was only 20,000 tons, but in 1956 it rose to nearly 1.2 million tons for the whole year. The Haiphong Cement Plant only produced 8,000 tons in the first six months after the takeover, but the output increased to 200,000 tons in 1956. The Nam Dinh Textile Factory was not put into production until the end of 1955 after renovation, but it produced 7,000 tons of yarn and nearly 20 million meters of cloth in 1956. After the abandoned Lao Cai apatite mine resumed production, it produced more than 20,000 tons of apatite in 1956. After the Haiphong, That Khe and other phosphate fertilizer plants resumed production, their output increased from 7,000 tons in the second half of 1955 to more than 30,000 tons in 1956. A total of 28 state-owned enterprises (such as the Hoang Van Thu Paper Mill) taken over from the old liberated areas were expanded and put into production.

In 1956, the state built a total of 18 new modern factories and mines. Among them, seven were completed in 1956, six have been completed successively recently, and five are still under construction. Due to the growth of state-owned industrial strength and increased output, the value of state-owned industrial output increased from 18.5 billion Vietnamese dong in 1955 (accounting for 16.7% of the total industrial output value) to 148 billion Vietnamese dong in 1956 (accounting for 46.4% of the total industrial output value), an increase of seven times. Therefore, the proportion of modern industrial output value (including private industry) in the total industrial output value (including handicrafts) also increased from less than 20% in 1955 to 60% in 1956.

In 1956, according to the actual situation and characteristics of the Vietnamese economy, the Vietnam Workers' Party emphasized that North Vietnam should prioritize the development of light industry at this stage and give full play to the potential of handicrafts and private industry to increase the production of consumer goods, so as to initially meet the needs of the urban and rural people whose purchasing power has increased after liberation and land reform. According to this policy, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has paid more attention to expanding and developing some daily necessities factories that require less investment, are easy to construct, generate profits quickly, and have significant effects. It is estimated that the total value of industrial output in 1957 will increase by more than double that of 1956. Although the proportion of the output value of private industry and handicrafts in the total industrial output value has decreased (83.3% in 1955, 53.6% in 1956), the absolute figure has increased (an increase of 85% in 1956 compared with 1955, and it is expected to increase by double in 1957 compared with 1956). Under the leadership of the state, private industry and handicrafts have also made contributions to the development of the national economy.

State-Owned Trade Has Been in a Leading Position in the Domestic Market

In the early stage of taking over new urban areas, private merchants had an absolute advantage in the commercial position in North Vietnam. In the first half of 1955, private merchants still accounted for 84% of the total domestic trade volume, 75% of wholesale, and 94% of retail. In 1956, state-owned trade rose to account for more than 40% of the total, more than half of wholesale, and 33.5% of retail, while private merchants fell to account for less than 55% of the total, less than half of wholesale, and about 60% of retail. Judging from the growth of the turnover of state-owned trade alone, the total amount in 1956 increased by more than double that in 1955, wholesale increased by more than half, and retail increased by nearly three times. State-owned trade has grasped the wholesale links of major commodities and played a leading role in domestic commerce. It has also almost completely grasped foreign trade, which is a strong guarantee for the country to carry out market management, gradually stabilize prices, promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and at home and abroad, and regulate the supply of various commodities.

With the growth of industrial and agricultural production, the total foreign trade volume of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in 1956 increased by one and a half times compared with 1955 (excluding international aid), with exports increasing by two and a half times and imports increasing by one time. The total domestic trade volume in 1956 increased by one-third compared with 1955, with retail sales increasing by half. Rice prices soared in the first half of 1955, and the grain supply was once tight, but now rice prices are very stable and grain stocks are abundant. This situation shows that the commercial work of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has been successful, although the supply of some daily necessities is a bit tight because it cannot keep up with the growth of the needs and purchasing power of urban and rural people.

In addition, great achievements have also been made in the restoration of the transportation system.

The State's Financial Revenue and Expenditure Situation is Improving

In the early days after the ceasefire, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's finances were quite difficult. Due to the Vietnam Workers' Party and the government strengthening leadership over financial and economic work, finding ways to increase income and reduce expenditures, and also receiving international assistance, Vietnam's financial situation has been improving day by day. Financial revenue and expenditure in 1955 and 1956 both reached a balance, thereby guaranteeing the progress of economic construction.

The content of financial revenue and expenditure of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in 1955 and 1956 has undergone tremendous changes compared with the period of the War of Resistance. In terms of income: Previously, agricultural tax revenue accounted for more than 60% of the total income. In the past two years, the income from industrial and commercial taxes and state-owned enterprises has risen rapidly and has become the main income along with agricultural taxes. In 1956, the income from industrial and commercial taxes and state-owned enterprises was more than that from agricultural taxes. These situations show that with the development of economic construction, the state has opened up new sources of revenue, and the burden on farmers has been relatively reduced. In terms of expenditure: Previously, military and administrative expenses accounted for the vast majority of the total expenditure (93% in 1952, 77% in 1953). In the past two years, the proportion of defense and administrative expenditures has decreased, while the expenditure on economic construction and cultural, educational, and social undertakings has increased rapidly. In the total expenditure in 1955, defense expenditure accounted for 32%, plus administrative expenditure accounted for 49%; economic construction expenditure accounted for 36.5%, rising to the first place, plus cultural, educational, and social undertaking expenditure accounted for 47%. This can be said to be the beginning of shifting from a supply-based finance to a construction-based finance. In the total expenditure in 1956, economic construction expenditure accounted for 46% of the total, more than double that of defense expenditure and more than double that of administrative expenditure, plus cultural, educational, and social undertaking expenditure accounted for more than 58%. In this way, the nature of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's finance has clearly become that of peaceful construction finance. (Attached picture)

    越南民主共和国经济建设的成就
    张易生
    1956年，越南民主共和国第一次制定和开始实行一个年度经济计划。越南民主共和国的经济恢复和建设工作，从印度支那停战以来已经取得很大成就，为越南北方铺平了走向社会主义的道路。
    农业生产的恢复和发展
    越南十七度线以北地区约有耕地二百万公顷，其中90％以上为稻田，战前常年产量约三百万吨左右。产量最高的1939年，使用的稻田面积为一百八十四万公顷，播种面积二百二十四万公顷（复种指数121.7），大米年产量为二百四十五万吨（大米单位面积产量为每公顷十三点三公担），按七成的出米率回算，稻谷年产量为三百五十万吨（稻谷单位面积产量每公顷十九公担，单季稻作平均产量每公顷十五点六公担）。战争期间耕种面积和产量大大缩减。停战实现以后，由于越南劳动党和政府强调执行土改和生产结合、经济恢复以农业尤其是粮食生产为主的方针，并大力推进互助合作运动；由于翻身了的农民生产积极性大大提高；由于水利灌溉系统的修复和扩展，十几万公顷荒地得到垦殖，防涝抗旱、改良种子、改进耕作技术等工作都有了进展，因而，越南北方两年来虽然也遭遇到严重的旱灾、内涝、风灾，但粮食作物还是连续丰收。1956年，农作物（包括经济作物）播种面积二百八十五万公顷，粮食作物（包括杂粮）播种面积二百七十六万公顷，稻谷播种面积二百二十八万公顷（使用的稻田面积为一百八十二万公顷，复种指数125.3），粮食总产量五百一十二万吨，稻谷产量四百一十三万吨，稻谷单位面积产量每公顷二十二点八公担，单季稻作平均产量每公顷十八点一公担，都创造了新的最高纪录。农业生产上这种巨大的成就，使得越南民主共和国不但能够保证北方人民免受历史性饥荒的威胁，并且在储备之后还有余粮可以接济南方人民和输出。这种成就同时也是今后国民经济发展的有力保证。
    工业总产值1956年已达战后最高峰
    在殖民主义统治时期，越南轻重工业都很落后。越南北方的工业虽然比较南方稍为发达些，但在战争期间遭受破坏，许多厂矿都减产以致停止生产。虽然这样，原有厂矿恢复生产的速度还是很快。鸿基煤矿接管初期，每月产煤仅两万吨，1956年上升到全年产煤近一百二十万吨。海防水泥厂接管后半年内仅产八千吨，1956年产量增到二十万吨。南定纱厂整修到1955年底才开始投入生产，1956年就产纱七千吨、布近二千万公尺。荒废了的老街磷灰石矿，恢复生产后，1956年产磷灰石两万余吨。海防、七溪等地磷酸盐厂恢复生产后，产量从1955年下半年的七千吨上升到1956年的三万余吨。接管的和老解放区原有的国营企业（如黄文树造纸厂），经扩建后投入生产的，共有二十八个单位。
    1956年国家新建的现代化厂矿共十八个单位。其中已有七个在1956年建成，六个在最近陆续建成，五个正在继续建设中。由于国营工业的力量增长、产量增加，国营工业的产值从1955年的一百八十五亿越元（占工业总产值的16.7％）增长到1956年的一千四百八十亿越元（占工业总产值的46.4％），即增长了七倍。因此，现代化工业产值（包括私营工业）在工业总产值（包括手工业）中的比重，也从1955年的不到20％上升到1956年的60％。
    1956年间，越南劳动党根据越南经济的实际情况和特点，着重指出，越南北方在现阶段要优先发展轻工业，并发挥手工业和私营工业的潜力，增加消费资料的生产，借以初步满足解放后、土改后购买力增长了的城乡人民的需要。按照这个方针，越南民主共和国政府已更注意扩建、发展一些投资少、施工易、生利快、收效大的日用品工厂。预计1957年工业总产值将比1956年增长一倍以上。私营工业和手工业的产值，虽然在工业总产值中的比重下降了（1955年83.3％，1956年53.6％），但绝对数字却增长了（1956年比1955年增长85％，预计1957年将比1956年增长一倍）。在国家领导下，私营工业和手工业也对国民经济的发展作出了贡献。
    国营贸易已处于国内市场上的领导地位
    接管新区城市初期，私商在越南北方的商业阵地上占有绝对优势。1955年上半年，私商还占有国内贸易总额的84％，批发的75％，零售的94％。1956年，国营贸易上升到占总额的40％以上，批发的一半以上，零售的33.5％，私商则下降到占总额的55％以下，批发的一半以下，零售的60％左右。单就国营贸易营业额的增长说，1956年比1955年总额增长一倍多，批发增长一半以上，零售额增长近三倍。国营贸易掌握了主要商品的批发环节，对国内商业起了领导作用，并几乎完全掌握了对外贸易，这对于国家进行市场管理，逐步稳定物价，促进城乡和国内外物资的交流，调节各种商品的供应，是有力的保证。
    随着工农业生产的增长，越南民主共和国1956年对外贸易总额比1955年增加一倍半（不包括国际援助），其中出口额增加两倍半，进口额增加一倍。1956年国内贸易总额则比1955年增加三分之一，其中零售额增加一半。1955年上半年米价暴涨，粮食供应曾一度紧张，现在则米价十分稳定，粮食库存丰裕。这种情况说明越南民主共和国的商业工作是有成绩的，虽然还有一些日用品的供应，由于跟不上城乡人民需要和购买力的增长，而显得有点紧张。
    此外，交通运输系统的恢复工作也取得了很大成就。
    国家财政收支情况日益好转
    停战后初期，越南民主共和国的财政曾颇困难。由于越南劳动党和政府对财政、经济工作加强领导，设法增加收入减少支出，并且还得到国际援助，所以越南的财政情况就日益好转，1955年和1956年财政收支都达到平衡，从而使经济建设的进行获得保证。
    1955年和1956年越南民主共和国财政收支的内容，同抗战时期比较起来，有了巨大的变化。就收入方面说：以前农业税的收入占收入总额的60％以上。两年来工商业税和国营企业的收入迅速上升，已同农业税并列为主要收入。1956年，工商业税和国营企业的收入都已多于农业税。这些情况表明，随着经济建设的发展，国家开辟了新的财源，农民的负担已相对地减轻。就支出方面说：以前军费、行政费在支出总额中占绝大比重（1952年93％，1953年77％）。两年来，国防和行政的支出比重下降，而经济建设和文教社会事业的支出则迅速上升。1955年支出总额中，国防支出占32％，加上行政支出共占49％；经济建设支出占36.5％，上升为第一位，加上文教社会事业支出共占47％。这可说是从供给财政转向建设财政的开端。1956年支出总额中，经济建设支出占总额的46％，比国防支出大一倍以上，比行政支出大两倍以上，加上文教社会事业支出共占58％以上。这样，越南民主共和国财政的性质，就明显地变成和平建设财政了。（附图片）
