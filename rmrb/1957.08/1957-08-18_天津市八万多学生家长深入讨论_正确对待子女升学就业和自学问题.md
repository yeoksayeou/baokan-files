    Tianjin's 80,000+ Student Parents Deeply Discuss
    Correctly Treating Children's Education, Employment, and Self-Study Problems

    (By our Newspaper) Tianjin, August 17th - More than 80,000 parents of middle and primary school graduates in Tianjin have widely discussed how to correctly approach their children's further education, employment, and self-study. This discussion began in late June. During the discussion, leading cadres of many units' Party and government organizations, district-level reporters, and street activists gave reports to graduate parents on how parents should correctly understand their children's education, employment, and self-study problems. Other promotional activities were also conducted. Street offices and many units universally organized graduate parents to repeatedly and carefully discuss the aforementioned reports and related promotional materials.

    Through discussion, many graduate parents clarified their various vague understandings of their children's future paths. Previously, many graduate parents eagerly hoped that their children could advance to higher levels of education, viewing student enrollment as the only way out and demanding that the People's Government establish more schools. They harbored resistance towards students participating in industrial, agricultural, and service industry labor. After the discussion, they changed the above views, recognizing that if students cannot continue their education after graduation, they should participate in labor or self-study according to the needs of the country. Some graduate parents said during the discussion, "We are all shouting and demanding that the government establish more schools, spending too much money in this area, which will affect the country's economic construction. Only by first doing a good job in economic construction and gradually developing schools with the gradual development of production is it a good idea that is good for the people, good for the country, and good for future generations." Many parents used the contrast between their personal and family lives before and after liberation to recount how the Communist Party and the People's Government have always been concerned about the happiness of the people. Many parents said: "We should also listen to the Communist Party and the People's Government on the issue of our children's future paths."

    During the discussion, many student parents also changed their views of belittling labor in agriculture and service industries. They used their personal experiences in various types of labor to point out that building socialism cannot be achieved by relying on only one profession, and "every profession produces an expert." Any kind of labor is glorious, and as long as you are down-to-earth and wholeheartedly serve the people, you will have a bright future. Zhang Wenxiu, a parent from Nanmen West in Nankai District, took out a photo of her son (a junior high school graduate) who was participating in agricultural construction in the Northwest at a discussion meeting and showed it to the graduate parents present. At the same time, she also described the vivid examples of her son's participation in agricultural labor in the Northwest. She believes that doing any job is good in our country. Student parents Zhou Huixin, Wang Huilan, and others also stated that if their children cannot continue their education, they will obey the needs of the country and can do any job. Some parents in Chengxiang District also stated that if the state has difficulty arranging labor positions for their children temporarily, they are prepared to find their own way.

    Regarding the issue of self-study, many parents have also gained new understanding through discussion. They considered that educating their children is the responsibility of every parent. If their children cannot continue their education and cannot participate in labor for a while, parents should arrange conditions for their children to study on their own. The Zhongshanmen Workers' New Village Street Office in Hedong District cooperated with student parents and local workers' families to prepare to set up review classes in the mass spare-time schools to absorb graduates from senior elementary schools for self-study. They also plan to allow graduates who cannot continue their education and those who have difficulty participating in labor for the time being to participate in social work such as street reading groups and disinfection teams outside of their self-study time, so as to exercise and cultivate the graduates' ability to serve the people. Many parents of graduates in Nantouyao in Hongqiao District and faculty members of Tianjin University have also studied how to arrange self-study for graduates.

    Currently, many parents still have many incorrect views on the issue of graduates' future paths. This discussion is still continuing in depth in order to better enable all parents to correct their understanding and correctly treat the issues of their children's further education, employment, and self-study after graduation.

    Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, August 17th - Many student parents in Fuzhou have correctly handled the issues of their children and relatives continuing their education and participating in labor production.

    Chen Junyun, the nephew of Deputy Governor Chen Shaokuan, graduated from junior high school at Fuzhou No. 6 Middle School this year. He has been educating his nephew for a long time, encouraging him to return home to participate in agricultural production if he fails to enter high school after graduation. Now Chen Junyun has returned to Lulei Township in Minhou to participate in agricultural production. Wu Congzheng, Secretary-General of the Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, Zhang Dao, Director of the Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce, Ma Jianzhong, Director of the Municipal Transportation Bureau, and others have also educated and arranged for their children respectively. Jiang Bin, Director of the Municipal Labor Bureau, mobilized his younger sister Jiang Suxiang, who is studying at Fuzhou No. 9 Middle School, to return to her hometown of Xujianchun Agricultural Cooperative in Shandong if she fails to enter high school to participate in agricultural production.

### 天津市八万多学生家长深入讨论  正确对待子女升学就业和自学问题

    天津市八万多学生家长深入讨论
    正确对待子女升学就业和自学问题
    本报讯  天津市八万多中、小学毕业生的家长普遍地讨论了关于如何正确对待子女升学、就业、自学问题，这一讨论是从6月下旬先后开始的。在讨论过程中，许多单位的党、政负责干部、区级报告员和街道积极分子分别向毕业生家长作了关于家长如何正确认识子女升学、就业和自学问题的报告，同时进行了一些其他的宣传活动。街道办事处和许多单位普遍组织毕业生家长就上述报告与有关的宣传资料反复细致地进行了讨论。
    经过讨论，在许多毕业生家长中间澄清了对自己子女毕业后的出路问题的种种模糊认识。原先，不少毕业生家长迫切希望子女能逐级升学，他们把学生升学看成了唯一的出路，要求人民政府多办学校；对于学生参加工、农业和服务性行业的劳动，则抱有抵触情绪。讨论之后，他们改变了上述看法，认识到学生毕业后如果升不了学就应根据国家需要，参加劳动或自学。有些毕业生家长在讨论时说，咱们都嚷着要求政府多办学校，在这方面花钱花得太多了，国家的经济建设就要受影响。只有首先搞好经济建设，随着生产的逐步发展兴办学校，才是对人民好、对国家好、对后代子孙好的好主意。许多家长以个人家庭解放前后生活的对比，历述共产党和人民政府向来都是为人民的幸福着想的。许多家长说：在子女毕业后的出路问题上，我们也应该听共产党和人民政府的话。
    在讨论中，不少学生家长也转变了轻视农业和服务性行业等劳动的观点，他们以本人参加各种劳动的切身体会指出：建设社会主义只靠一行一业是不成的，而且“行行出状元”，什么样的劳动都是光荣的，只要脚踏实地全心全意为人民服务，都有光辉的前途。南开区南门西一位家长张文秀，在一次讨论会上掏出了她那个在西北参加农业建设的儿子（初中毕业）的照片，给在场的毕业生家长们看，同时还叙述了她儿子在西北参加农业劳动的生动事例。她认为，在咱们国家里做什么活都是好的。学生家长周惠新、王惠兰等人也表示，孩子如果升不了学，就服从国家需要，做什么工作都可以。城厢区还有些家长表示，如果国家一时难以为孩子们安排劳动岗位，他们自己准备自谋出路。
    对于自学的问题，许多家长通过讨论也有了新的认识。他们考虑到教育子女是每个家长应有的责任，孩子升不了学，一时又不能参加劳动，家长应该为孩子们安排自学的条件。河东区中山门工人新村街办事处就和学生家长以及当地的工人家属合作，准备在群众业余学校里附设复习班，吸收高小毕业生来自学。他们还准备让升不了学和一时难以参加劳动的毕业生们，在自学时间以外参加街道上的读报组、消毒队等社会工作，借以锻炼、培养毕业生为人民服务的工作能力。红桥区南头窑和天津大学教职员中的许多毕业生的家长也都研究了如何安排毕业生自学的问题。
    目前，还有不少家长对毕业生的出路问题存有许多不正确的看法，这一讨论仍在继续深入开展，以求更好地使全体家长端正认识，正确地对待自己子女毕业后的升学、就业、自学问题。
    本报讯  福州市许多学生家长正确处理好自己子女、亲属升学和参加劳动生产问题。
    陈绍宽副省长的侄儿陈俊云今年在福州第六中学初中毕业，他很早以来就对他侄儿进行教育，勉励他如果毕业后考不上高中，便回家参加农业生产。现在陈俊云已回到闽侯胪雷乡参加农业生产了。民盟省委秘书长吴从征、市工商局局长张导、市交通局局长马健中等也分别对自己的子女进行了教育和安排。市劳动局长姜彬动员他在福州第九中学读书的妹妹姜素香，如果考不上高中，便回到家乡山东徐建春农业合作社参加农业生产。
