Xinhua News Agency, August 28th – Vice Premier Deng Zihui delivered a report today at the National Farmland Water Conservancy Work Conference. He stated that during the upcoming Second Five-Year Plan period, the primary measure for developing China's agricultural production would still be increasing yield per unit area, and the first thing to rely on to increase yield per unit area is water conservancy.

Vice Premier Deng said that during the First Five-Year Plan period, China's farmland water conservancy work had already achieved great successes, exceeding the achievements of any dynasty in history. He said that the farmland water conservancy development plan for 1958, proposed at this conference for the Second Five-Year Plan period, is also practical and appropriate. According to this plan, China will increase its irrigated area by more than 40 million mu next year, and the irrigation capacity of the existing 43 million mu will also be improved. In addition, soil and water conservation work will be carried out on more than 40,000 square kilometers of land, and flood prevention and drainage projects will be built on more than 40 million mu of low-lying areas. The result of the implementation of this plan will further reduce disasters and increase agricultural production.

Vice Premier Deng said that the guiding principles and lines for developing farmland water conservancy in the future are to rely on the masses, rely on cooperatives, and follow the mass line; rely on the importance attached by the Party committees to obtain cooperation from all parties; adapt to local conditions in terms of technology; and add planned support from the state. He said that in the work deployment, we should grasp the key points and take into account the general situation. At the same time, we must make overall plans and comprehensive arrangements, that is, combine flood control and drainage, irrigation, and soil and water conservation, and not carry them out in isolation. Developing small and medium-sized water conservancy projects is the main direction of work during the Second Five-Year Plan period.

Vice Premier Deng also predicted that through the socialist education work currently being carried out in rural areas and the improvement of the production management system of agricultural production cooperatives, a new upsurge in agricultural production will appear in this winter and next spring.

　　提高单位面积产量的首要依靠
　　发展中小型水利
　　邓子恢在全国农田水利工作会议上作报告
    新华社28日讯　邓子恢副总理今天在全国农田水利工作会议上作了报告。他说，在即将到来的第二个五年计划时期，发展我国农业生产的主要措施也仍然是提高单位面积产量，而提高单位面积产量，第一就要依靠水利。
    邓副总理说，在第一个五年计划期间，我国农田水利工作已经取得伟大的成绩，这个成绩超过了历史上任何朝代的成就。他说，这次会议所提出的第二个五年计划时期1958年的农田水利发展计划，也是切合实际的，妥当的。按照这个计划，我国明年将增加灌溉面积四千多万亩，原有的四千三百万亩面积的灌溉能力也将得到提高。此外，还要在四万多平方公里的土地上开展水土保持工作，在四千多万亩低洼地区的土地上兴修防水排涝工程。这个计划实现的结果，将会进一步减免灾害，提高农业生产。
    邓副总理说，今后发展农田水利的方针路线是依靠群众，依靠合作社，走群众路线；依靠党委重视以取得各方面的配合；在技术上的因地制宜；加上国家有计划的支援。他说，在工作部署上，应该抓住重点兼顾一般，同时还要统筹计划全面安排，即防洪排涝、灌溉、水土保持等相结合，不能孤立进行。发展中小型水利是第二个五年计划时期工作的主要方向。
    邓副总理还预计，通过目前农村正在进行的社会主义教育工作和农业生产合作社生产管理制度的改善，在今冬明春农业生产上将出现新的高潮。
