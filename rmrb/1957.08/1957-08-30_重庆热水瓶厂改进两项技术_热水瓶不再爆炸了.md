Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, August 28th. Workers at the locally state-owned Chongqing Thermos Factory have made two significant technical improvements in thermos production. These two technical improvements are of great importance for eliminating the explosion of glass liners, improving the quality and production efficiency of thermoses, which urgently need to be resolved in China's current thermos production.

At the end of April this year, the factory for the first time adopted a new method of using ammonium sulfate tablets as support and asbestos thread or bone charcoal, activated carbon, etc. as absorbents in the interlayer of the glass liner, and successfully trial-produced a batch of thermoses with glass liners without asbestos particles. After more than three months of trial use by users, none of these glass liners without asbestos particles have exploded so far, and the pressure resistance and insulation are exactly the same as ordinary glass liners.

Another technical improvement made by this factory is to change the method of heating, exhausting, and drying the outside of the glass liner, which has been used in China's thermos manufacturing industry, to heating, exhausting, and drying the inside of the glass liner. According to the factory's tests, this new method can not only improve efficiency by more than double compared to the old method, but also greatly reduce the phenomena of yellowing of the glass liner and explosion of the bottle mouth.

　　重庆热水瓶厂改进两项技术
　  热水瓶不再爆炸了
    据新华社重庆28日电　地方国营重庆热水瓶厂职工先后在热水瓶生产方面作了两项重大的技术改进。这两项技术改进，对目前我国热水瓶生产中迫切需要解决的消灭瓶胆爆炸，提高热水瓶的质量和生产效率，有很大作用。
    这个厂在今年4月底第一次采用在瓶胆夹层内以硫酸铵片作支撑和以石棉线或骨炭、活性炭等作吸剂的新方法，试制成功了一批无石绵粒瓶胆的热水瓶。这批无石棉粒瓶胆的热水瓶，经过用户三个多月来的试用，到目前为止还没有一个瓶胆爆炸，耐压和保温方面也完全跟普通瓶胆一样。
    这个厂的另一项技术改进是把我国热水瓶制造工业中一向沿用的在瓶胆外部加热排气和干燥的方法，改为在瓶胆内部加热排气和干燥。根据这个厂的试验证明，用这种新方法，效率不仅可以比旧方法提高一倍以上，而且瓶胆烘黄、瓶口爆炸等现象也可以大大减少。
