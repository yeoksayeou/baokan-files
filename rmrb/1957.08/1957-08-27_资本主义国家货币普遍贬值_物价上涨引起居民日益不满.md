The magazine said that there are many reasons for the currency depreciation in capitalist countries, one of which is the continuous increase in military expenditure. The magazine said that capitalist governments are currently trying to stop inflation, because rising prices are causing growing dissatisfaction among residents, thus becoming a "political explosive."
