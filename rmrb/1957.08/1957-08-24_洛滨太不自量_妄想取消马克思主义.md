Luo Bin Overestimates Himself
　　Vainly Attempts to Cancel Marxism
　　This newspaper reports that cadres of the CCP Gansu Provincial Committee organs exposed and criticized the reactionary words and deeds of the rightist Luo Bin, who opposed the Party and opposed Marxism-Leninism. On June 16th, he presented an extremely arrogant "opinion" to the Party, opposing the Party and opposing Marxism, openly clamoring to abolish the Party's leadership and to abolish Marxism-Leninism.

　　In his "opinion," Luo Bin viciously described Marxism as "dogmatism," saying that "Marxism is a cliché that appeared a hundred years ago," and is something like "teaching scriptures." Luo Bin also frantically wanted to abolish the Party's leadership over ideological work, actually negating the Party's leading role. He believed that "the Party in Gansu Province cannot lead ideological work," saying that "the Party leadership in Gansu doesn't even understand the scope of ideological work," and that "the provincial party secretary and ministers are all 'laymen' in this regard."

　　Another tactic used by Luo Bin to attack the Party's leadership was to abolish the Party's leadership over literary and artistic work. He said: "The Gansu Provincial Party leadership is even more of a 'layman' when it comes to literature and art," and believed that the responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee's Culture and Education Department did not understand literature and art, were not experts, and "could not even determine the literary and artistic policy." He openly clamored to abolish the Party's leadership over cultural and artistic work, saying: "Laymen cannot lead experts; if the Provincial Party Committee doesn't understand, they shouldn't lead."

　  洛滨太不自量
　　妄想取消马克思主义
    本报讯　中共甘肃省委机关干部，揭露和批判了右派分子洛滨的反党反马克思列宁主义的反动言行。他在6月16日极其狂妄地向党提出了一个反党反马克思主义的
  “意见书”，公开叫喊要取消党的领导，和取消马克思列宁主义。
    洛滨在他的“意见书”中，恶毒地把马克思主义说成是“教条主义”，说“马克思主义是一百年以前就出现的陈词术语”，是“教经”一类的东西。洛滨还丧心病狂地要取消党对思想工作的领导，实际上是要否定党的领导作用。他认为“甘肃省的党不能领导思想工作”，说“甘肃的党领导连思想工作范畴都不懂”，说“省委书记和部长在这一点上都是‘外行’。”
    洛滨攻击党的领导的另一种手法，是要取消党对文艺工作的领导。他说：“甘肃省党的领导对文艺更是‘外行’”，并认为省委文教部的负责同志不懂文艺，不是内行，“连文艺方针都确定不了”。他公然叫嚣着要取消党对文化艺术工作的领导，说：“外行不能领导内行，省委不懂就不要去领导。”
