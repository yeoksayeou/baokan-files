    To Provide Systematic Data for Reforming Minority Languages
    Chinese Academy of Sciences Completes Survey of Seven Ethnic Minority Languages and Scripts in Xinjiang
    (Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi) The survey of the languages and scripts of seven ethnic minorities in Xinjiang has been completed.
    Over the course of nearly a year, the survey team investigated the development of the languages and scripts of the Uyghur, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Xibe, and Tajik peoples, collected a large amount of material on the dialects, local languages, and folk poems of each ethnic group, and provided relatively systematic data for the reform and creation of the languages and scripts of each ethnic group. To facilitate research, the survey team recorded more than 400,000 vocabulary words and more than 12,000 pages of folk literature historical materials during the survey, and also collected folk literature and books on politics and religion, including a long poem by an ancient Uzbek poet copied in Uyghur script from the early 18th century and contracts of the Kyrgyz people from more than 200 years ago.
