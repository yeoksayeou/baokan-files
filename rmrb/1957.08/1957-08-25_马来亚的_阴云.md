　　The "Dark Clouds" of Malaya
　　Hu Yuzhi
　　The Federation of Malaya—Asia's youngest new nation—is about to be born on August 31 this year, breaking away from the protection of the British Empire.
　　At this moment, a film made in Malaya, performed entirely by Malayan artists, is being shown in our country for the first time.
　　Although the people of Malaya have not yet truly been liberated from colonial rule; although the Federation of Malaya cannot be said to be completely independent; nevertheless, we Chinese people warmly welcome the birth of a new country in our neighborhood.
　　The Chinese people have the closest relationship with the people of Malaya. Three ethnic groups—Malay, Chinese, and Indian—constitute the main part of the population of Malaya. Chinese laborers, together with other Malayan ethnic groups, especially Malays and Indians, have contributed generations of hard work to the development of this rich land of Malaya. The Chinese, Malay, and Indian ethnic groups have also undergone long-term bloody struggles against colonialism and for the independence and freedom of Malaya. It is only natural that the Chinese people have extremely deep feelings for the people of Malaya.
　　I have been to Malaya several times. I love the scenery of Malaya, and I especially love the people of Malaya—a hardworking, brave, and enthusiastic people. If it is said that the film "Dark Clouds" truly reflects the life of the Malayan people, that is not quite accurate. But you can still see from the screen the pure inner life and strong fighting will of the working people.
　　Almost every Malayan actor in this film possesses sufficient artistic level. The scene where Azizah's two children beg for a living reflects the century-long suffering of the Malayan people, who still have an indomitable fighting spirit, which is very touching. The scene where Hussein and his son meet in the brick factory expresses class friendship through the father-son relationship, and the director's and actors' techniques and acting skills are also particularly brilliant.
　　In addition, the title of this film is particularly meaningful. Originally, in tropical lands, the sky is clear and cloudless. But it is undeniable that for more than a hundred years, the people of Malaya have been shrouded in the dark clouds of colonialism, unable to see the sunlight. The Malayan people have vigorous vitality and a lively fighting spirit; they have been tempered and tested in a very difficult fighting environment. I firmly believe that, like the ending of this film, the heroic Malayan people will soon push through the clouds and see the blue sky, and achieve a glorious victory!

　　马来亚的“阴云”
　　胡愈之
    马来亚联合邦——亚洲最年轻的一个新国家——就要在今年8月31日脱离英帝国的保护而诞生了。
    就在这时候，一部在马来亚拍制、完全由马来亚艺术家演出的片子，第一次在我国放映。
    尽管马来亚人民还没有真正从殖民主义统治下得到解放；尽管马来亚联合邦还不能说是已经完全独立了；但是，我们中国人民对于在我们的近邻一个新的国家的诞生，仍是热烈欢迎的。
    中国人民和马来亚人民有最亲密的关系。马来血统、中国血统和印度血统的三个民族构成马来亚居民的最主要部分。中国的劳动人民曾经和其他马来亚民族，特别是和马来人、印度人一道，为了马来亚这个富饶的国土的开发，贡献出世代的辛勤劳动。中国、马来、印度三个民族也曾经为了反对殖民主义，争取马来亚的独立自由而经过长期的流血斗争。中国人民和马来亚人民有极浓厚的感情是十分自然的。
    我曾到过马来亚几次。我爱马来亚风物，我尤其爱马来亚人民——这是勤劳、勇敢、热情的人民。如果说，“阴云”这部影片，如实反映了马来亚人民的生活，那是不恰当的。但是你从银幕上仍然可以看出劳动人民的那种纯洁的内心生活和坚强的战斗意志。
    这部影片中的马来演员几乎每一个都具有足够的艺术水平。阿茜莎的两个孩子行乞来维持生活这一段，反映了马来亚人民百年来受尽磨折，仍然有不屈不挠的斗志，这是十分感动人的。胡赛恩和他的儿子在砖瓦厂相遇这一段，通过父子关系表达出阶级友爱，导演和演员的手法、演技也显得特别高明。
    此外，这部片子的名称，特别有意义。本来，在热带的国土上，天空是晴朗无云的。但是不可否认，一百多年来，马来亚人民是被笼罩在殖民主义的阴云之下，看不见阳光。马来亚人民具有蓬勃的朝气和生龙活虎的斗争精神，他们是在十分艰苦的战斗环境中，久经锻炼和考验的。我十分相信像这部影片的结局一样，英勇的马来亚人民，在不久将来，将拨云雾而见青天，取得光辉的胜利！
