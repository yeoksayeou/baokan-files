(Dispatch from our London correspondent, August 14) Our correspondent in London today visited Mr. Zorin, head of the Soviet delegation to the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee, to inquire about some issues related to the current disarmament negotiations. The questions posed by our reporter and Zorin's replies are as follows:

Q: What are the main obstacles in the Disarmament Subcommittee preventing an agreement from being reached?

A: The main obstacle in the Subcommittee hindering a disarmament agreement, as has been demonstrated in the past five months of negotiations, is the unwillingness of Western countries to take practical steps towards achieving genuine disarmament, primarily their unwillingness to renounce atomic and hydrogen weapons. They call these weapons a "deterrent" and insist that they reduce the risk of a new war, but in reality, these weapons are merely tools for the large-scale slaughter of people of all countries and are therefore condemned by people of all countries as weapons of aggression.

The position adopted by Western countries is to use various pretexts to evade accepting the Soviet proposal to cease atomic and hydrogen weapon testing. Ceasing atomic and hydrogen weapon testing would have been the first practical step towards halting the atomic arms race and eliminating the threat of an atomic war. Western countries have put forward various conditions regarding the cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapon testing, thereby hindering the realization of this very important measure for the cause of peace. At the same time, they have also created obstacles on other disarmament issues.

For example, they have created an obstacle to reaching an agreement on substantial reductions in conventional armaments and armed forces; proposing that the implementation of such an agreement be conditional on the resolution of the most important international issues. However, the conditions put forward by Western countries on these issues are unacceptable to other countries.

Western countries themselves are limited to proposing a cessation of the production of atomic materials for military purposes, while they strongly oppose the prohibition of the use and production of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and the destruction of such weapons from the armaments of all countries. Western countries conduct consultations within their military bloc organizations and listen to the opinions of those who oppose disarmament, while refusing to invite countries outside the military blocs to attend the Disarmament Subcommittee and listen to the latter's opinions, even though these countries are genuinely concerned about consolidating peace and universal security. The case of the refusal to invite India to attend the Disarmament Subcommittee is just such an example. This factual situation cannot but hinder the success of the Subcommittee's work.

Q: What are the main points of divergence between the Soviet proposals and the Western countries' proposals?

A: The proposals put forward by the Soviet Union are close to the positions of Western countries on some important issues, providing a basis for reaching a broad disarmament agreement (the proposal of March 18) and implementing partial disarmament (the proposal of April 30), and finally making it possible to resolve separately and without delay the cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapon testing, while establishing appropriate international supervision (the proposal of June 14).

As for the Western countries, they have not yet put forward any new proposals that could serve as the basis for reaching a broad or partial disarmament agreement. Their proposals on the registration, limitation, and short-term cessation of nuclear weapon testing, like their proposals for aerial and ground inspection, are attached to various preconditions for resolving disarmament issues, and therefore, in practice, obstruct the achievement of any agreement aimed at both reducing conventional armaments and armed forces and eliminating the danger of atomic war. The different positions held by the Soviet Union and Western countries on important disarmament issues are as follows:

On the issue of ceasing atomic and hydrogen weapon testing, the Soviet Union has proposed an immediate cessation of such testing for two or three years, with appropriate international supervision of the implementation of this agreement, including the establishment of monitoring stations in the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and the Pacific. However, Western countries do not agree to extend the cessation of testing beyond ten months, thus preventing obstacles to preparing new tests. In addition, they say that they are only prepared to temporarily cease testing when unresolved issues such as the cessation of production of atomic materials for military purposes, the reduction of armed forces and armaments, and the establishment of aerial and ground inspection have been agreed upon. Therefore, it is quite clear that Western countries do not really want to cease atomic and hydrogen weapon testing, but are merely trying to use the above conditions to mask their negative attitude towards this issue.

In addition, the Soviet Union proposed publicly declaring a ban on atomic and hydrogen weapons, ceasing production, and destroying all types of atomic and hydrogen weapons from the armaments of all countries, so that all atomic materials could be used entirely for peaceful purposes. At the same time, the Soviet Union is prepared to first reach an agreement on the prohibition of the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons, as the first step in implementing partial measures to reduce atomic armaments, and leave other issues to be resolved later. However, Western countries only demand an agreement to cease the production of fissionable materials for military purposes, and they strongly oppose the proposal to prohibit the use and production of atomic and hydrogen weapons and to destroy these weapons from the armaments of all countries. They resolutely refuse to accept the unconditional prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons.

The Soviet Union proposed that the armed forces of the Soviet Union and the United States be reduced to a level of one million to one and a half million people, and the armed forces of Britain and France be reduced to a level of six hundred and fifty thousand people. In order to facilitate an agreement, the Soviet Union is prepared to agree to the recent proposal by the United States to reduce the armed forces of the Soviet Union and the United States to a level of one million seven hundred thousand people, provided that this reduction is not conditional on resolving major international political issues. As for the Western countries, they only agree to reduce the armed forces of the Soviet Union and the United States to a level of two million five hundred thousand people, and the armed forces of Britain and France to a level of seven hundred and fifty thousand people, which would not actually affect the existing level of armed forces in the United States, Britain, and France. Regarding further reductions, Western countries have proposed that they be conditional on resolving major international issues, such as the German question and other issues. This proves the fact that Western countries are actually opposed to concluding an agreement to substantially reduce their armed forces.

The Soviet Union firmly advocates the establishment of strict and effective international supervision over the implementation of the various measures stipulated in the disarmament agreement. The proposals submitted by the Soviet Union to the Subcommittee have formulated appropriate international supervision methods for various disarmament plans, including the establishment of ground monitoring stations and aerial inspection. We have repeatedly stated that supervision of disarmament is an integral part of any practical disarmament plan.

However, Western countries are attempting to replace the entire disarmament issue with the issue of supervision. They do not offer constructive opinions on the essence of the disarmament issue as pointed out in the Soviet Union's partial disarmament proposal of April 30, but instead, on August 2, they put forward proposals for aerial and ground inspection, considering them to be the most urgent and important disarmament measures. The true intention of Western countries is to reduce the disarmament issue to establishing supervision over the armaments and military forces of other countries and collecting intelligence, without undertaking any obligations to actually reduce military forces and armaments or to prohibit nuclear weapons.

Finally, the Soviet Union proposed reaching an agreement on gradually abolishing military bases on foreign territories, prohibiting the storage of atomic weapons on foreign territories, and gradually reducing and withdrawing the troops stationed by the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union in the two parts of Germany and in the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact respectively. Western countries oppose all these measures, and they do not offer any constructive suggestions.

Thus, while the Soviet Union is making great efforts to resolve the above issues and put forward appropriate constructive proposals, Western countries are refusing to accept any proposals aimed at reaching a genuine agreement on the main issues of disarmament. In this way, they are hindering the Subcommittee from working effectively.

Q: What positive results do you think have come from the negotiations over the past five months?

A: The positive results of the London negotiations of the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee are as follows: First, the negotiations have drawn the attention of governments, parliaments, and the public in various countries to important issues in disarmament, and have helped the peace forces in various countries to stop atomic weapon testing and eliminate the threat of atomic war. At the same time, efforts to reduce armaments and reduce military expenditures are becoming more and more active.

At the same time, in the work of the Subcommittee, the possibility of reaching an agreement on individual issues of partial disarmament has emerged. If Western countries had shown the same sincere desire and goodwill to reach an agreement as the Soviet Union, these possibilities could have been realized.

However, it is worth noting that the aggressive groups within the United States, Britain, France, West Germany, and other countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are currently stepping up their resistance, opposing the adoption of any genuine disarmament measures and opposing the reaching of preliminary agreements on disarmament issues.

This fact requires all countries that are concerned about consolidating peace and the democratic forces of all countries to step up their efforts to oppose those who are hindering the effective resolution of disarmament issues, to ease international tensions, and to create normal conditions for the peaceful lives of the vast masses of people around the world.

    伦敦裁军会议的障碍是什么？
    佐林答本报记者问
    本报伦敦14日电  本报驻伦敦记者今日往访联合国裁军小组委员会苏联代表团团长佐林，询以有关当前裁军谈判的一些问题。本报记者所提的问题及佐林的答复如下：
    问：在裁军小组委员会中阻碍达成协议的主要障碍是什么？
    答：在小组委员会中妨碍达成裁军协议的主要障碍，正像五个月来谈判所表现的，是西方国家不愿在达成真正的裁军方面采取实际的步骤，首先是不愿意放弃原子武器和氢武器。它们把这类武器称作是一种“威慑力量”，并且硬说它能减少新战争的危险，可是实际上，这类武器只是一种大规模屠杀各国人民的工具，因而被各国人民指责为进行侵略的武器。
    西方国家所采取的立场就是用各种借口规避接受苏联的关于停止原子武器和氢武器试验的建议。而停止原子武器和氢武器试验本来是中止原子军备竞赛、消除一次原子战争威胁的第一个实际步骤。西方国家在停止原子武器和氢武器试验方面提出了各种条件，从而阻碍了在和平事业方面实现这个非常重要的措施。与此同时，它们在其他的裁军问题上也设置了障碍。
    例如它们在达成大量削减常规军备和武装部队的协议方面设置了一个障碍；提出实现这种协议须以最重要的国际问题的解决为前提。但是西方国家就这些问题提出的条件却又不是其他国家所能接受的。
    西方国家自己只限于提出停止生产用于军事目的的原子物质的建议，同时它们又强烈反对禁止使用和生产原子武器和氢武器，反对从各国的军备中销毁这类武器。西方国家在它们的军事集团组织内部进行商讨并倾听那些反对裁军者的意见，而拒绝邀请处于军事集团以外的国家出席裁军小组委员会并听取后者的意见，而这些国家是真诚地关心巩固和平和普遍安全的。拒绝印度出席裁军小组委员会的情况就是这样。这种事实情况，不能不妨碍小组委员会工作的成功。 
    问：苏联的建议和西方国家的建议的主要分歧点在哪里？
    答：苏联提出的建议，在一些重要问题上同西方国家的立场接近，为达成一项广泛的裁军协定（3月18日的建议）和实行局部裁军（4月30日的建议）提供了基础，并且最后使分别地、毫不延搁地解决停止原子武器和氢武器试验、同时建立适当的国际监督（6月14日建议）成为可能。
    至于西方国家，它们直到现在还没有提出可以作为达成广泛的或局部的裁军协议的基础的任何新建议。它们关于登记、限制和短期停止核武器试验的建议，也正像它们的空中和地面视察建议一样，其中附有各种解决裁军问题的先决条件，因此实际上也就是阻挠达成任何目的在于既削减常规军备和武装部队又消除原子战争危险的协议。苏联和西方国家在重要的裁军问题上所抱的不同立场如下：
    关于停止原子武器和氢武器试验问题，苏联曾建议立即停止此种试验二年或三年，并对这一协议的实施进行适当的国际监督，包括在苏联、美国、英国和太平洋建立监督站。但是西方国家不同意使停止试验期超过十个月以上，这样就使准备新试验不会受到障碍。此外，它们还说只有当诸如停止生产用于军事目的的原子物质、裁减武装部队和军备、建立空中和地面视察等等未决问题达成协议的时候，它们才准备暂时停止试验。因此，十分明显，西方国家并不真正想停止原子武器和氢武器试验，而是仅仅试图提出上述条件来掩饰它们对于这个问题所抱的否定态度。
    此外，苏联建议公开宣布禁用原子武器和氢武器、停止生产并从各国军备中销毁一切类型的原子武器和氢武器，以便将所有的原子物质完全用于和平目的。同时，苏联准备先就禁止使用原子武器和氢武器问题达成协议，作为实行裁减原子军备的部分措施的第一个步骤，而将其他问题留待以后再来解决。但是西方国家却仅仅要求达成停止生产军用裂变物质的协议，它们竭力反对关于禁止使用和生产原子武器和氢武器、并从各国军备中销毁这些武器的建议。它们断然拒绝接受无条件禁用原子武器和氢武器的主张。
    苏联建议苏联和美国的武装部队裁减到一百万至一百五十万人的水平、英国和法国的武装部队裁减到六十五万人的水平。为了便于达成协议，苏联准备同意最近美国所提出的关于苏联和美国的武装部队裁减到一百七十万人的水平的建议，假如这一裁减并不以解决重大的国际政治问题为条件的话。至于西方国家，它们仅仅同意把苏联和美国的武装部队裁减到二百五十万人的水平、把英国和法国的武装部队裁减到七十五万人的水平，这样就不会实际影响美国、英国和法国现有的武装部队的水平。关于进一步的裁减，西方国家提出了要以解决重大的国际问题，如德国问题及其他一些问题为条件。这就证明了这样一个事实，西方国家实际上反对缔结大量裁减它们的武装部队的协定。
    苏联坚决主张对裁军协议所规定的各项措施的执行，建立一种严格的、有效的国际监督。苏联向小组委员会提出的建议，针对各种不同的裁军计划，拟具了适当的国际监督办法，其中包括建立地面监督站、空中视察等项。我们一再申述，裁军的监督是任何切实可行的裁军计划不可分割的部分。
    但是，西方国家企图用监督问题来代替整个的裁军问题。它们不对苏联4月30日提出的局部裁军建议中指出的裁军问题的本质提出建设性的意见，却在8月2日提出了关于空中、地面视察的建议，认为这是最迫切、最重要的裁军措施。西方国家的真实打算，是把裁军问题缩减为对其他国家的军备与军事力量建立监督、收集情报，而不对实际裁减军力与军备、禁止核武器承担任何义务。
    最后，苏联建议就逐渐取消在外国领土上的军事基地、禁止在外国领土储藏原子武器、逐渐减少并撤退美、英、法、苏在德国两部分以及各自在北大西洋公约国家、华沙条约国家的驻军等问题取得协议。西方国家反对所有这些措施，而它们又不提出任何建设性的建议。
    这样，当苏联正在作出重大的努力以解决上列问题并提出适当的建设性建议的时候，西方国家却拒绝接受以在裁军主要问题上达成真正协议为目的的任何建议。这样它们就阻挠了小组委员会有成效地进行工作。
    问：你认为最近五个月以来的谈判，有什么积极的结果？
    答：联合国裁军小组委员会伦敦谈判的积极结果如下：首先，谈判引起了各国政府、议会、公众人士对裁军方面的重要问题的注意，有助于各国的和平力量制止原子武器试验、解除原子战争威胁的努力。同时，裁减军备与缩减军费的努力也愈来愈为活跃了。
    同时，在小组委员会的工作中，出现了就局部裁军的个别问题达成协议的可能。如果西方国家表现了与苏联一样的、取得协议的真诚愿望与善意，这些可能本来是可以实现的。
    不过，值得注意的是，在美、英、法、西德及北大西洋公约组织其他国家内的侵略集团，目前加紧抵抗，反对采取任何真正的裁军措施并反对在裁军问题上达成初步的协议。
    这个事实，要求一切关心巩固和平的国家和一切国家的民主力量加紧努力，反对那些阻挠切实解决裁军问题的人，缓和国际紧张局势，为全世界广大人民群众创造和平生活的正常条件。
