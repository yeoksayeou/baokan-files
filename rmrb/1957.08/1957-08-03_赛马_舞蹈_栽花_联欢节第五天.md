Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 2nd: The fifth day of the World Youth Festival (August 1st) saw the largest horse racing festival in decades held at the Moscow Hippodrome. As the competition began, five officers on black steeds performed various dances to music. Subsequently, various races were held.

The Festival's classical and representative dance competition, with Soviet ballet master Ulanova as chairman of the judging committee, opened at the Tchaikovsky Hall. This is the largest competition in the history of the festivals, with one hundred and four actors from twenty-two countries participating. Youth artists from Czechoslovakia, Britain, Italy, East Germany, and other countries participated in the first four-hour performance.

Ulanova gave her first performance for festival participants at the Bolshoi Theatre, where her portrayal of Juliet in the ballet "Romeo and Juliet" deeply touched the audience. After the performance, the audience was reluctant to leave, and many waited in the rain near the staff entrance of the theater, hoping to catch a glimpse of her.

Since the opening of the festival, many theaters, including the Bolshoi Theatre, the Maly Theatre, and the Central Puppet Theatre led by Obraztsov, have been staging classical and modern masterpieces of drama and song and dance for young people from various countries.

East Germany, Egypt, Finland, and Cyprus all held their first national song and dance performances on the 1st.

On this day, one hundred Hungarian girls planted a large number of roses in the garden of the Central Soviet Army House to commemorate the Soviet soldiers who gloriously sacrificed themselves in the battles to liberate Hungary in 1944-1945 and to quell the counter-revolutionary rebellion in October 1956.

On this day, the International Student Club arranged a meeting for future scientists at Moscow University.

    ——联欢节第五天——
    据新华社莫斯科2日电　世界青年联欢节第五日（8月1日），莫斯科跑马场上举行了近几十年来最大的赛马节。比赛开始时，五位军官骑着的黑色骏马随着音乐作了各种舞蹈表演。随后举行了各项比赛。
    由苏联芭蕾舞大师乌兰诺娃担任评判委员会主席的联欢节古典舞蹈和代表性舞蹈比赛在柴可夫斯基大厅开幕。这是历届联欢节中最大的一次比赛，有二十二国的一百零四名演员参加。参加历时四小时的第一次演出的有捷克斯洛伐克、英国、意大利、民主德国等国的青年艺术家。

    自联欢节开幕以来，莫斯科大剧院、小剧院、奥布拉兹卓夫领导的中央木偶剧院等许多剧院都在为各国青年们演出古典和现代名剧和歌舞。
    民主德国、埃及、芬兰、塞浦路斯都分别在1日举行了第一次民族歌舞演出。
    这一天，一百位匈牙利姑娘在中央苏军之家的花园里栽种了大量的玫瑰花，纪念在1944年—1945年解放匈牙利的战斗中和1956年10月肃清反革命叛乱中光荣牺牲的苏军战士。
    这一天，国际学生俱乐部在莫斯科大学为未来的科学家们安排了一次会见。
