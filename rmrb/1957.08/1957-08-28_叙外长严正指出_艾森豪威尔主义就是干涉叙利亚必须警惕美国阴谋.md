　　Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, August 27th: Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar condemned on August 26th that the Eisenhower Doctrine itself is interference, and its current aim is to "strangle the Syrian government and the Egyptian government."

　　Bitar said at a press conference attended by many Western journalists that Syria's policy of active neutrality "does not mean that we should not cooperate economically with the Soviet Union and Western countries." However, he said that the Eisenhower Doctrine has too many conditions attached to it, which makes Syria afraid to accept any economic assistance from the West.

　　Bitar said that Syria wants to rapidly industrialize the country, and therefore reached a preliminary economic assistance agreement with the Soviet Union, but this does not preclude cooperation with Western countries.

　　Bitar listed the reasons why Syria rejected the Eisenhower Doctrine, saying: "First, because the purpose of this doctrine is to establish a certain Arab government in violation of the will of the Arab people;

　　"Second, because it incites these governments against Syria and Egypt, and isolates them;

　　"Third, because the capitals of certain Arab countries are becoming places for launching and preparing conspiracies against Syria;

　　"Fourth, because the countries that accept this doctrine accept military and economic assistance in order to create riots in Syria."

　　Bitar pointed out that Syria must continue to be vigilant against the conspiracies that are continuing against it, "because its policy of active neutrality is displeasing to Western countries and the United States."

　　叙外长严正指出
　  艾森豪威尔主义就是干涉叙利亚必须警惕美国阴谋
    据新华社27日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚外交部长比塔尔8月26日谴责艾森豪威尔主义本身就是干涉，它现在的目的是要“扼杀叙利亚政府和埃及政府”。
    比塔尔在一次有许多西方记者参加的记者招待会上说：叙利亚奉行的积极中立政策“并不意味着我们不应当在经济上同苏联和西方国家合作”。但是，他说：艾森豪威尔主义所附带的条件太多，它使叙利亚不敢从西方接受任何经济援助。
    比塔尔说：叙利亚想迅速使国家工业化，因此同苏联达成了初步的经济援助协定，但是这并不排斥同西方国家合作。
    比塔尔列举叙利亚拒绝艾森豪威尔主义的原因说：“第一，因为这个主义的目的是要在违反阿拉伯人民意志的情况下建立某种阿拉伯政府；
    “第二，因为它煽动这些政府反对叙利亚和埃及，并且孤立它们；
    “第三，因为某些阿拉伯国家首都正在变成对叙利亚发动和准备阴谋的地方；
    “第四，因为接受这个主义的国家所以接受军事和经济援助是要在叙利亚制造骚乱。”
    比塔尔指出，叙利亚必须继续警惕那些正在继续对它进行的阴谋，“因为它的积极中立政策是西方国家和美国所不高兴的”。
