    Unofficial Test Run a Success
    Train Crosses Yangtze River Bridge for the First Time
    (Our Wuhan dispatch, August 15) The first train crossed the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge this afternoon. The first unofficial test run of this newly built bridge was a success.
    At 3:00 p.m., the train departed from Hanyang Station, passed the famous Guqin Terrace, climbed up Turtle Mountain, and spanned the bridge. The train was driven by Xu Baorong, an experienced driver with twenty years of driving experience. In the past, he had to stop the train every time he drove to Xiaguan in Nanjing or Xujiapeng in Wuchang. This time, however, he carefully drove the train slowly across the Yangtze River Bridge with excitement. The workers on the bridge and the passengers on the boats crowded around the railings, cheering for the first train to cross the Yangtze River Bridge. Luo Qibin, the engineer in charge of steel beam construction, closely followed the train, watching the condition of the steel beams after the train passed. He didn't breathe a sigh of relief and return to the construction site until the train had crossed the bridge. The train climbed up Snake Mountain in Wuchang, passed the old site of the Yellow Crane Tower, and entered Wuchang South Station, then turned around and crossed the entire bridge in less than three minutes. According to Deputy Chief Engineer Li Fen, "In the future, it will only take one minute to cross this bridge, which is more than one kilometer long."
    Since the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge was joined in early May, workers have been rushing to pave the road surface and erect the rails. Now, the first track has been laid, the road panels of the highway bridge surface have been paved, and four elevators have been installed for pedestrians to go up and down. The entire project is basically completed. In the next ten days, they will repeatedly test the vehicles and comprehensively check the quality of the bridge, preparing for the official opening in October.

    非正式试通车获得成功
    火车首次驶过长江大桥
    本报武汉15日电  第一列火车在今天下午驶过了武汉长江大桥。这座新建大桥的首次非正式试通车获得了成功。
    下午三时，火车从汉阳车站开出，横过了著名的古琴台，便爬上了龟山，跨上了大桥。这列火车是由有二十年行车经验的老司机徐宝荣驾驶的。过去，他每次将火车开到南京下关或武昌徐家棚时就得停车；这时，他却怀着激动的心情谨慎地将列车缓缓地开过长江大桥。桥上的工人们和船上的乘客们都拥在栏杆边上，向第一次驶过长江大桥的火车欢呼。负责钢梁施工的罗其斌工程师则紧紧跟在列车后面，观看列车驶过以后钢梁的情况，一直到火车驶过桥梁，他才舒畅地出了口气，折回工地去了。火车驶上武昌蛇山，越过黄鹤楼旧址，进入了武昌南站，然后又回过头来，以不到三分钟的时间驶过全桥。据李芬副总工程师说：“将来只用一分钟的时间就可以过完这一公里多长的大桥。”
    武汉长江大桥从5月初合龙后，就在赶铺路面，架设钢轨。现在，它已经架好了第一条轨道，铺好了公路桥面的路面板，并装好四台专供行人上下用的电梯，整个工程已经基本完成。他们在最近十天还要反复试车，全面检查大桥的质量情况，准备在10月正式通车。
