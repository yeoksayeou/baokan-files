    The Minjin Education Department Branch Further Exposes
    Lin Handa Prostrating Himself at the Feet of Capitalism
    (Our dispatch) The China Association for Promoting Democracy (Minjin) Education Department Branch held a meeting on the afternoon of the 3rd to criticize Lin Handa's absurd statements. Lin Handa first made a self-criticism at the meeting, but he did not confess any new material or earnestly conduct a self-examination.
    Vice Minister of Education Wei Que said that Lin Handa was very good at seizing power in his work, using his authority casually, and rarely asking for instructions from superiors. At the same time, Lin Handa possessed very strong bourgeois ideology and lifestyle, even a petty bourgeois style. Yang Dongchun, Secretary-General of the Minjin Central Committee, said that Lin Handa took leave on July 16 specifically to write a self-criticism, but in these eighteen days, he was at home writing historical stories about the Han and Western Han dynasties, and did not honestly write a self-criticism at all.
    Zhao Jingyue, who accompanied Lin Handa on an inspection tour to Shanghai, revealed that during the inspection in Shanghai, Lin Handa purposefully incited teachers to "boldly speak out" at a meeting of more than 1,300 cadres of industrial and agricultural spare-time education in Shanghai, saying that they should "appeal to the door (referring to the Ministry of Education and the Education Bureau), once is not enough, twice is not enough, three times." Lin also said, "The life of intellectuals is hard, but it is not the hardship, the feeling of being stifled in the heart is the true hardship." Zhao Jingyue also revealed that Lin Handa was very nostalgic for things in the old society and hated new things. For example, he had a lot of opinions about "Great World" being renamed "Playground," the names of roads named after imperialist elements being changed, and private enterprises being transformed into joint state-private enterprises.
    Xu Jianxi, Lin Handa's secretary, revealed that in November last year, on the way to Guangxi for an inspection, Lin Handa said to Xu Jianxi: "China has no experience in developing a capitalist economy, and suddenly it is developing a socialist economy, how can it work!" He also said: "Look, as long as America has money, it has everything. The living standards of the American people are high. This is a problem of the system." And he talked a lot about the American way of life and his "happy life" when he studied in the United States. Xu Jianxi also revealed a large number of facts about Lin Handa's perfunctory and irresponsible work, and his concentration on writing historical stories during inspections or working hours in order to earn royalties.
    At the meeting, Wang Shao'ao, Vice Chairman of the Minjin Central Committee, also criticized Lin Handa's erroneous statements, pointing out that Lin Handa should make a good confession.

    民进教育部支部进一步揭露
    林汉达拜倒在资本主义脚下
    本报讯　中国民主促进会教育部支部于3日下午举行会议，批判林汉达的荒谬言论。林汉达在会上首先作了思想检讨，但他并没交代任何新的材料和认真进行思想检查。
    教育部副部长韦悫说，林汉达在工作中很会抓权，随便使用职权，很少向上级请示。同时，林汉达存在着非常浓厚的资产阶级思想和生活作风，甚至是市侩作风。民进中央秘书长杨东蓴说，林汉达从7月16日请假，专门写思想检查，可是在这十八天内，他却在家里写东西汉历史故事，根本没有老老实实写思想检查。
    曾经随同林汉达到上海视察的赵景岳，揭发了林汉达在上海视察期间，曾在上海一千三百多人的工农业余教育干部的会议上，别有用心煽动教师要“大胆的鸣放”，要“告到门上去（指教育部、教育局）一次不行两次，两次不行三次。”林还说，“知识分子的生活苦，不算苦，心里闷，才算苦”。赵景岳还揭露林汉达对于旧社会的东西非常留恋，仇视新的事物。例如，“大世界”改名为“游乐场”，帝国主义分子命名的马路的名称改了，私营企业改成公私合营了，他对这些都很有意见。
    林汉达的秘书徐建西，揭露去年11月林汉达去广西视察途中，对徐建西说：“中国连搞资本主义经济的经验也没有，一下子就搞社会主义经济，那儿行！”又说：“看，美国只要有钱，什么东西都有，美国人民生活水平就是高。这是制度问题。”并且大谈美国的生活方式以及他在美留学时的“快乐生活”。徐建西还揭露了林汉达在工作中敷衍塞责，为赚取稿费，在视察或在工作时间内，专心编写历史故事的大量事实。
    会上，民进中央副主席王绍鏊也批判了林汉达的错误言论，指出林汉达应该好好交代。
