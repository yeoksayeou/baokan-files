    What Kind of "Welcoming Spring Flower" is This?
    By Our Correspondent Jin Yukun
    
    A Guangming Daily reporter, Yin Yi, was sent to Shenyang to "set fires." Upon arriving in Shenyang, the reporter lamented: here "it is as if a gust of east wind occasionally blows through the dead of winter, but the earth remains a scene of silence!"
    
    If not for finally discovering that "beneath the surface of this river, flowing so slowly as to be almost still, there lies a current of激流 (jīliú - rapid torrent)" it seems he would have left disappointed.
    
    This "潜藏着的激流 (qiáncángzhe de jīliú - hidden rapid torrent)" appeared at the Northeast Institute of Technology. The reporter cheered: this is Shenyang's "first welcoming spring flower!" (Note: Guangming Daily on May 24th published a news report about right-wing elements at the Northeast Institute of Technology using the "Blooming and Contending" campaign to conduct anti-Party activities, titled: "The First Welcoming Spring Flower.")
    
    The Origin of the "Welcoming Spring Flower"
    
    This "welcoming spring flower" at the Northeast Institute of Technology attracted the attention of intellectual circles in Shenyang at the time. To explain the origin of this "welcoming spring flower," let's first discuss the situation at the Northeast Institute of Technology.
    
    The Party organization at the Northeast Institute of Technology had also made sectarian errors in the past; during the early stages of the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries campaign, the scope of the struggle was also somewhat broad; some of these shortcomings have been corrected, and some are being corrected. However, the right-wing elements at the Northeast Institute of Technology attempted to exploit these shortcomings to expand and manufacture contradictions, in order to achieve their anti-Party and anti-socialist goals.
    
    During the early stages of the Blooming and Contending campaign, right-wing elements Chen Shangjiong, a lecturer in the Mechanical Engineering Department and member of the China Democratic League, and right-wing elements Yue Congfeng and Wang Yusheng became very active. At a League group meeting, Chen Shangjiong poured out the resentment that had been long suppressed in his heart, and arranged the topics for each person's speech. During the spring break, they extensively recruited League members, expanded the ranks of the right-wing, and everywhere they colluded and infiltrated each other, meeting in small groups in secret rooms or in the shady depths of Nanhu Park, to pour out their hearts. Its core figures began to study the struggle objectives and strategies in the coming storm. Chen Shangjiong called this period: the stage of training cadres and unifying thought.
    
    "The First Shot!"
    
    After the spring break, right-wing elements such as Chen Shangjiong seized the opportunity when the Party committee was concentrating its efforts on organizing students to study, and eagerly launched an offensive against the Party. On the one hand, they planned to combine small group meetings into departmental meetings, in order to strengthen their momentum; on the other hand, they falsely claimed that the Party committee's organization of student study was a "diversionary tactic," "afraid of the Blooming and Contending," and forced the Party committee secretary to attend the meeting to express his attitude. At the meeting, right-wing element Yang Yuelin took the lead in "checking" the Party committee secretary, and declared that the "Party committee was rigid" and "suppressed the Blooming and Contending," using the emotions of the masses to launch a joint signature campaign of eighty-two people, demanding that the provincial and municipal Party secretaries come to the institute to participate in the Blooming and Contending.
    
    At this time, Wu Congfang, the right-wing element and deputy director of the Propaganda Department of the Democratic League Municipal Committee, and Yin Yi, a reporter from Guangming Daily, came immediately upon hearing the news. Yin Yi said to them: "I have been to many places across the country, and the most difficult thing to overcome is the Party committee." Wu Congfang ordered them to "seize the leadership of the Blooming and Contending from the Party committee," and Chen Shangjiong determined the action slogan at the time: "Break through the Party committee's barrier, the Party committee has fallen behind the masses, the Democratic League must rise up to support."
    
    At their joint request, the First Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee personally attended the meeting and expressed his firm support for the Blooming and Contending, which satisfied everyone. The right-wing elements, fearing that the "fire" they had just fanned would be extinguished, used the excuse that the Shenyang Daily had not published the news of the Blooming and Contending to incite people. At the meeting the next day, Chen Shangjiong personally took the lead in slandering the report of the Municipal Party Committee Secretary as "empty and devoid of content," "not supporting the Blooming and Contending," and being "thoroughly bureaucratic," and declared: "If you don't publish it, we will engage in great democracy." Xu Yetong, another leader of a right-wing group, a professor in the Arts and Crafts Department who came to help, also shouted about being "wronged" and "oppressed" at the meeting, and his "daredevil" Wang Ge also clamored: "Where is our motherland, everywhere is repression!"
    
    At this point, the right-wing group believed that the "fire" was strong, and decided to immediately seize the leadership of the Blooming and Contending, openly inciting the masses not to trust the Party, saying that "the Party committee is paralyzed," and at the same time describing the Party committee members and general branch secretaries in the central group leading the Blooming and Contending as "stubborn elements" who suppressed the Blooming and Contending, and wanted to squeeze them out. From then on, the central group of the Mechanical Engineering Department became the core of the right-wing anti-Party activities of the entire department and the entire institute.
    
    Because the right-wing group dared to "check" the Municipal Party Committee Secretary, it was praised by Wu Congfang as "a valuable first shot," and was considered a "national initiative!"
    
    The Man Behind the Scenes
    
    Before and after the "first shot" was fired, Chen Yanzhi, chairman of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Democratic League, and Wu Congfang, deputy director of the Propaganda Department, engaged in frequent behind-the-scenes activities. After the right-wing group "checked" the Municipal Party Committee Secretary, Wu Congfang moved from behind the scenes to openly directing the battle. Chen Yanzhi and Wu Congfang criticized the Northeast Institute of Technology Democratic League branch for being "weak and ineffective," Wu Congfang told Chen Shangjiong to "contact the League Municipal Committee by telephone every three days, and be available at any time," and summarized the experience of the previous stage, instructing the right-wing group: "The Party is currently in a passive position, we should seize the opportunity to quickly move into discussions of sectarianism, the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries issue, and how to run the school." Then, the Democratic League Nanhu Working Group was established, and their "fire-setting" experience was introduced in the internal publications of the Democratic League, attempting to use the Northeast Institute of Technology as a base to "set fires" in major universities in Shenyang.
    
    Under the command of Wu Congfang, the right-wing group's attack unfolded from the two wedges of the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries and sectarianism. They first described the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries campaign as a "dark world" of the Communist Party's retaliation. Right-wing elements openly claimed to "uphold justice," "vindicate the victims," to "maintain human ethics, respect the great constitution." Xu Yetong, the hero of vindicating counter-revolutionaries, a former KMT Major General and professor in the Arts and Crafts Department, raised his arms, and tearfully accused the Communist Party of the "crimes" caused by the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries.
    
    Then, right-wing elements such as Chen Shangjiong clamored in the meeting that Communist Party members were "claws and teeth," "like monkeys, putting on clothes as soon as the gong is struck...",
    
    "Devoid of humanity", all "eat by their Party Membership Card", only able to play "the role of the secret police". On the big-character posters, they massively smeared the Communist Party as "family-run," and "relatives of the emperor". Most of the members of the school's Party committee were named, saying that the Party committee was a base for "attacking and excluding dissidents," and "the Party committee's sectarianism was cultivated by the Municipal Party Committee," therefore "rectification is treating the symptoms, purging the Party is the fundamental cure." Right-wing elements such as Chen Shangjiong repeatedly promoted "Party committee members have no teaching or professional abilities, how can they lead the school?" They fantasized about "professors governing," and also advocated establishing an "extraordinary committee" above the Party and government.
    
    In order to further set off an anti-Party climax, Chen Shangjiong and others actively engaged in manufacturing the "Sun Wei Incident."
    
    Sun Wei was the former propaganda director of the Institute of Technology's Party committee. He was of bad ideological character and had committed serious errors. The Party committee had already dealt with him. Chen Shangjiong also admitted that the Party committee's handling was serious and fair. But in the Municipal Political Consultative Conference, based on the Party committee's investigation and handling materials, he still made a vicious speech against his conscience, "Looking at the Leadership of the Northeast Institute of Technology from the Sun Wei Incident." And in a vicious tone, he questioned the Municipal Party Committee. In order to fan the flames even more, after the meeting Chen Shangjiong repeatedly claimed that there were things more serious than the Sun Wei issue, trying to make people believe that the entire Party organization was a mess.
    
    At the same time, the right-wing group in the Arts and Crafts Department, headed by Xu Yetong, was trying to provoke a second "Sun Wei Incident" to further fuel the fire.
    
    This is the scene that Yin Yi wrote about, where "it is no longer the silence of winter, but a thriving spring scene."
    
    The "Welcoming Spring Flower" Withers!
    
    Yin Yi believed that the "growth and strengthening, flowering and fruiting" of this "welcoming spring flower" "could be expected in days". But contrary to their expectations, the anti-Rightist struggle began. The right-wing elements were forced to retreat while fighting. On June 15th, the Shenyang Daily published Ding Guohua's exposé of the right-wing elements' counter-criticism, and the Shenyang Daily published an editorial for this purpose. Chen Shangjiong's henchmen, Yu Dawei, Guo Fuchun, and others, were the first to organize a meeting to counterattack the Shenyang Daily; on the one hand, they educated their henchmen to have the "determination to fight to the end," and to be "prepared to go to jail and beg for food," while at the same time posting the Shenyang Daily everywhere, using big-character posters, broadcasting, and other tools to counterattack. The right-wing elements planned to incite the masses, then launch a signature campaign protesting the Shenyang Daily, thereby leading the masses to the streets. But these conspiracies ultimately failed.
    
    After the People's Daily published the editorial "Why is This?", the right-wing element Yang Yuelin cursed: I hope this sectarian flower of the People's Daily withers quickly! But to their regret, it was this "welcoming spring flower" that withered quickly.
    
    After more than a month of anti-Rightist struggle, the ugly face of the anti-Party group centered on the Democratic League right-wing at the Northeast Institute of Technology has been completely exposed, and this "welcoming spring flower" praised by Yin Yi has withered forever!

    这是一朵什么样的“迎春花”？
    本报记者　金雨困
    光明日报记者殷毅奉命到沈阳“放火”。一到沈阳，这位记者就感叹地说：这里“正像残冬里偶而刮过一阵东风，大地依然是一片沉寂！”
    要不是终于发现了这条“流速缓慢得几乎静止的河流”的下面“潜藏着激流”的话，看来就只能失望而去了。
    这股“潜藏着的激流”出现于东北工学院。这位记者欢呼：这是沈阳的“第一朵迎春花！”（注：5月24日光明日报介绍了东北工学院右派分子利用鸣放进行反党活动的通讯，题为：“第一朵迎春花”。）
    “迎春花”的由来
    东北工学院这朵“迎春花”，在当时曾引起沈阳知识界的注目。为了交代这朵“迎春花”的由来，先说一说东北工学院的情况。
    东北工学院的党组织，过去也曾犯过宗派主义错误；在肃反运动的初期，斗争的面也较宽了一些；这些缺点有些已改进有些正在改进。但是东北工学院的右派分子，却企图利用这些缺点扩大和制造矛盾，以达到其反党反社会主义的目的。
    鸣放初期，右派分子、机械系讲师、民盟成员陈尚炯和右派分子岳从风、王裕生等大为活跃起来。在盟的一次小组会上，陈尚炯将长期积压在内心深处的怨恨都倒了出来，又安排了各人发言的专题。春假中，他们大量发展盟员，扩大右派力量，到处拉拢，互相渗透，三五相约于密室或南湖公园的林荫深处，畅谈心曲。其骨干人物就着手研究在即将到来的风暴中的斗争目标和策略问题。陈尚炯把这个时期叫做：训练干部统一思想的阶段。
    “第一枪！”
    春假过后，陈尚炯等右派分子抓住了当时党委集中力量组织学生学习的时机，迫不及待地向党发起了攻势。一边策划将小组鸣放合而为全系鸣放，以壮大声势；一边扬言党委组织学生学习是“调虎离山”“害怕鸣放”，逼迫党委书记到会表示态度。在会上，由右派分子杨岳霖带头“将”党委书记的“军”，并声言“党委僵化”，“压制鸣放”，利用群众情绪发动了八十二人的联合签名，要求省、市委书记来院参加鸣放。
    这时，民盟市委右派分子、宣传部副部长吴从枋和光明日报记者殷毅听到风声马上赶来。殷毅和他们说：“我走过全国不少地方，最难过的是党委这一关”。吴从枋就下令向党委“夺取鸣放的领导权”，陈尚炯就确定当时的行动口号：“击破党委这一关，党委已跟不上群众，民盟必须起来支持”。
    在他们联名请求下，市委第一书记亲自参加了会议，并表示坚决支持鸣放，大家都很满意。右派分子唯恐刚煽起的“火”就此熄灭，就借口沈阳日报未刊载鸣放新闻进行煽动。在第二天的会上，即由陈尚炯亲自带头污蔑市委书记的报告“空洞无物”，“不支持鸣放”，是“彻底的官僚主义”，并扬言：“你不给登，我们就搞大民主”。跑来助威的另一右派集团头子、工艺系教授许冶同也在会上喊“冤”叫“屈”，他的“闯将”王格也随之叫嚣：“哪里有我们的祖国，到处是镇压！”
    至此，右派集团认为“火势”已旺，决定立即夺取鸣放领导权，公开鼓动群众不要信任党，说“党委已陷于瘫痪状态”，同时将领导鸣放的中心小组内的党委委员、总支书记说成是压制鸣放的“顽固派”，要把他们排挤出去。从此机械系的中心组就成了全系及全院的右派反党活动的核心。
    由于右派集团敢于“将”市委书记的“军”，因而被吴从枋誉为“可贵的第一枪”，并被认为是“全国的创举！”
    幕后人
    在投出“第一枪”的前前后后，民盟沈阳市委主任委员陈彦之、宣传部副部长吴从枋进行了频繁的幕后活动。在右派集团“将”了市委书记“军”后，吴从枋就从幕后转为公开临阵指挥。陈彦之、吴从枋批评了东北工学院民盟支部“软弱无力”，吴从枋要陈尚炯“三天用一次电话与盟市委联系，必要时随叫随到”，并总结了前一阶段经验指示右派集团：“目前党已处于被动地位，应抓紧时机赶快转入宗派主义、肃反问题、如何办校问题的讨论”。接着成立了民盟南湖工作组，在民盟的内部刊物上介绍了他们的“放火”经验，企图以东北工学院为据点，在沈阳各大专院校大事“放火”。
    在吴从枋的指挥下，右派集团的进攻就从肃反和宗派两个楔子展开。他们首先把肃反运动说成共产党进行打击报复的“黑暗世界”。右派分子公开声称要“伸张正义”，“为被害者伸冤”要“维护人伦道德，尊重伟大宪法”。为反革命伸“冤”的英雄、国民党少将、工艺系教授许冶同在会上振臂高呼、痛哭流涕地控诉共产党肃反造成的“罪恶”。
    接着陈尚炯等右派分子在会上张牙舞爪地叫嚣共产党员是“爪牙”，“宛如猴子，一敲锣就穿衣，……”，
    “没有人性”，都是“靠党证吃饭”，只能起“秘密警察作用”。在大字报上大事污蔑共产党是“家天下”“皇亲国属”。学校党委成员大部被点名，说党委是“打击排除异己”的大本营，而“党委的宗派主义，又是市委培养起来的”，因此“整风是治标，清党才是治本”。陈尚炯等右派分子一再宣传“党委委员没有教学业务能力，靠他们怎么能领导学校呢？”他们异想天开地提出“教授执政”，还主张成立一个架于党政之上的“非常委员会”。
    右派集团为了进一步掀起一个反党的高潮，陈尚炯等就积极从事制造“孙伟事件”。
    孙伟是工学院前任党委宣传部长，思想品质恶劣，犯有严重错误，党委已作处理。陈尚炯也承认党委的处理是严肃和公正的。但他在市政协会上根据党委的调查和处理材料，仍然昧着良心作了恶毒的“从孙伟事件来看东北工学院的领导”的发言。并以恶毒的口吻质问市委。为把火苗煽得更旺，会后陈尚炯一再扬言比孙伟问题严重的有的是，企图使人相信整个党组织是一团糟。
    与此同时，以许冶同为首的工艺系右派集团正在力图挑起第二个“孙伟事件”进一步煽火。
    这就是殷毅所写的“再也不似冬日之沉寂，而是一片欣欣向荣的春日风光”的景象。
    “迎春花”雕谢了！
    殷毅认为这朵“迎春花”的“成长壮大，开花结果”，“将可以计日而待”。但出乎他们意料之外，反右派斗争开始了。右派分子不得不被迫转入且战且退。6月15日沈阳日报刊载了该院丁国华揭露右派分子的反批评，沈阳日报为此发表了社论。陈尚炯的喽啰余大伟、郭福纯等首先出来组织反击沈阳日报的大会；一面教育他们的喽啰要有“斗争到底的决心”，并有“准备坐牢和讨饭的精神”，同时到处张贴沈阳日报，利用大字报、广播等工具进行反扑。右派分子计划将群众煽动起来后，就发动抗议沈阳日报的签名，从而把群众引向大街。但是这些阴谋终未得逞。
    当人民日报发表了“这是为什么？”的社论后，右派分子杨岳霖诅咒说：但愿人民日报这朵宗派主义的大花迅速雕谢！但使他们遗憾的是迅速雕谢的却是这朵“迎春花”。
    经过一个多月的反右派斗争，东北工学院以民盟右派为核心的反党集团的丑恶面目已经被彻底揭穿，被殷毅所赞扬的这朵“迎春花”，就这样永远雕谢了！
