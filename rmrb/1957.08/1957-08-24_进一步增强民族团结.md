Editorial: Further Enhance National Unity

Today, this newspaper publishes the news of the symposium on ethnic work held in Qingdao by the Nationalities Affairs Commission and the Nationalities Committee of the National People's Congress, as well as the main points of the speech made by Ulanhu, Vice Premier of the State Council and Chairman of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, at this meeting. We would like to take this opportunity to offer some opinions on the current situation and tasks of ethnic work.

Over the past eight years, the Party and the state have made great achievements in ethnic work. With the great victory of the socialist revolution and socialist construction throughout the country, more than 85% of the minority population areas have basically achieved socialist transformation in the ownership of the means of production. Economic and cultural construction in minority areas has also developed to varying degrees, and people's lives have been initially improved. The implementation of the policy of national regional autonomy has achieved good results. In areas accounting for 90% of the total population of minority nationalities, autonomous regions and autonomous organs have been established. The number of minority cadres has increased from more than 10,000 in the early days of liberation to more than 340,000, and more than 400,000 Communist Party members and 600,000 Communist Youth League members have been developed. National relations have been greatly improved. Compared with the early days of liberation, historical national estrangement has been greatly reduced, and the unity and mutual assistance among all nationalities have been greatly strengthened, thereby consolidating our unified multi-ethnic family.

At present, all ethnic groups in our country are in a period of unprecedented transformation and construction. Our goal is to build a powerful socialist industrial country where no one exploits anyone, and all ethnic groups develop and prosper together, fundamentally changing the backwardness of all ethnic groups in our country in terms of economy and culture. Socialism is the only way for all ethnic groups in our country to achieve complete liberation, and it is also the only way for all ethnic groups to achieve prosperity and development. Only by resolutely following the socialist path can all ethnic groups achieve common prosperity and development. In the past, the main reasons why many ethnic minorities in our country declined, their economies did not develop, and their populations also decreased year by year were the result of imperialist aggression against the people of all ethnic groups in our country and the domestic reactionary ruling class's policy of oppression and exploitation against ethnic minorities over the past century. Their policy was not a policy of common prosperity and development for all ethnic groups, but a policy of decline and weakening for all ethnic groups. From the day it was born, the Communist Party of China has opposed national oppression, advocated national equality, and strived to achieve the common development and prosperity of all ethnic groups. The ethnic policy of the Communist Party of China is a policy of prosperity and development for all ethnic groups, and the socialist road is the road of development and prosperity for all ethnic groups. Any ethnic group that wants to achieve socialism must go through social reform (including democratic reform and socialist transformation). Because only through reform, establishing a socialist economic system and political system, can the productive forces be completely liberated, and can a broad road be opened up for economic and cultural development. Ethnic groups can have different times for reform, different paces for reform, and the specific methods of reform should also be different according to the different conditions of each ethnic group, but reform is inevitable for any ethnic group. It is difficult to imagine that a socialist society can be built on the basis of feudal ownership, slave ownership, and even primitive backward modes of production without reform. At present, the Han areas and the vast majority of minority areas in our country have already achieved the victory of socialist transformation in the ownership of the means of production. However, there are still a small number of minority areas that have not completed or have not begun to implement social reforms. These areas will also gradually complete democratic reforms and socialist transformations in the next few years, respectively, according to the different situations of the local ethnic groups. Even in areas where socialist ownership of the means of production has been basically realized, there is still a process of continuing to establish and consolidate the socialist system. It is difficult to imagine that reforms have been carried out in other ethnic areas across the country, and only certain ethnic areas can never be reformed and can always be in a backward state. It is also difficult to imagine that the new socialist system can be consolidated without a certain period of arduous and in-depth work. Some people worry that the result of implementing reform and transformation "will make the nation disappear"; this is an over-concern and a misunderstanding. Obviously, after the victory of socialist transformation, the ownership of the means of production and the superstructure of all ethnic groups have changed, but the ethnic groups still exist. What has changed are only those old things that are not suitable for the progress and development of all ethnic groups, and what has been established is a brand-new society. Socialist transformation will not only not eliminate all ethnic groups, but will make all ethnic groups unprecedentedly prosperous and developed. Now it is not a question of national elimination, but a question of common development and common prosperity for all ethnic groups.

With the advancement of our country's socialist transformation and construction, the economic and cultural ties between all ethnic groups in our country will become closer and closer, and the mutual approach and mutual influence between all ethnic groups will also increase. Is this situation terrible? It should be recognized that the strengthening of mutual approach and mutual influence between all ethnic groups is the result of the victory of our country's revolution and the development of construction, and it is an inevitable trend in the progress of society. As long as society continues to move forward, and all ethnic groups are constantly making progress, then the possibility of mutual approach and mutual influence between all ethnic groups, as well as mutually accepting each other's excellent historical and cultural traditions and advanced experiences, will become greater and greater. The common things between ethnic groups will become more and more, and the differences between ethnic groups will become less and less, and smaller. There is nothing terrible about this, but it is a gratifying phenomenon required by the development and progress of all ethnic groups.

In the great cause of socialist transformation and socialist construction in our country, what we need most is to constantly consolidate the unification of the motherland and enhance the unity of all ethnic groups. Chairman Mao said in his article "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "The unification of the country, the unity of the people, and the unity of all ethnic groups in the country are the basic guarantees for the inevitable victory of our cause."

All ethnic groups in our country are united in a unified big family, which is the natural result of historical development. Therefore, we have various favorable conditions to constantly enhance the unity and friendly relations of all ethnic groups.

First, the people of all ethnic minorities in our country and the Han people have shared a common destiny for a long time. Before liberation, the people of ethnic minorities not only suffered the oppression of the Han reactionary rulers together with the Han people domestically, but also suffered the aggression and oppression of imperialism together with the Han people externally. After liberation, we overthrew the three great mountains weighing on the Chinese people—the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism—and eliminated the domestic system of national oppression. However, the threat of imperialist aggression against the people of all ethnic groups in our country still exists. Even now, U.S. imperialism still occupies our country's Taiwan, and imperialism, led by the United States, is still using every opportunity to attempt to split and undermine our country's unity and the unity of all ethnic groups.

Second, our country has a population of 600 million and a land area of more than 9.6 million square kilometers. Although ethnic minorities account for only 6% of the total population and are generally less developed politically, economically, and culturally than the Han people, their residential areas are vast, accounting for about 50%-60% of our country's total area, and they are rich in resources, with great potential for the development of industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry, and occupy an important position in the socialist construction of the motherland. Although the Han people's residential areas account for only 40%-50% of the country's total area, the Han people have a large population and are relatively developed politically, economically, and culturally, and occupy a dominant position in our national life. Only when the Han people and all ethnic minorities are closely united, support each other, cooperate with each other, and learn from each other's strengths can we build our country into a strong socialist country where all ethnic groups develop together, prosper, and are happy.

Third, the distribution of all ethnic groups in our country is intertwined, with most ethnic minorities and Han people living together, and most ethnic minorities also living in an interlaced manner. Many ethnic minorities are widely dispersed and concentrated in small areas, and there are very few places where only one ethnic group lives. For example, in Xinjiang, where ethnic minorities live in relatively concentrated areas, there are also thirteen ethnic groups with certain concentrated areas.

Fourth, in the long historical development, economic cooperation and cultural exchanges have developed among our ethnic groups. Even in the years when reactionary rulers implemented national oppression, this economic connection and cultural exchange still developed. Especially in the recent decades, the people's democratic revolution movement led by the Communist Party of China has linked the fate of the people of all ethnic groups in our country together, forming a close and inseparable connection. These situations make it completely necessary and possible for all ethnic groups in our country to live in a unified and liberated motherland family and unite on an equal footing.

Since the development level of the Han people is generally ahead of that of the ethnic minorities, and in history the Han ruling class has long ruled and oppressed ethnic minorities, causing some ethnic minorities to be squeezed into areas with very poor natural conditions, greatly limiting their development. This situation makes it necessary for us to take care when implementing the policy of national equality after the national liberation, and makes the Han people even more responsible for taking the initiative to unite and actively help ethnic minorities. Helping ethnic minorities develop is a glorious and unshirkable duty of the Han people. Ethnic minorities should welcome this kind of help.

National equality is the foundation of national unity. In order to further enhance the national unity of our country and build a socialist family of all ethnic groups in our country, it is necessary to continue to implement the policy of national regional autonomy and fully guarantee the equal rights of ethnic minorities and the autonomous rights of ethnic minorities in their places of residence. The experience of implementing the policy of national regional autonomy in recent years has proved that national regional autonomy is completely suitable for the historical development and current situation of all ethnic groups in our country, and it is most conducive to the implementation of unity and mutual assistance among all ethnic groups and the development of the politics, economy, and culture of all ethnic groups. The rapid development of industrial, agricultural, and animal husbandry production and the significant improvement of people's lives in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, and many other ethnic minority autonomous areas have irrefutably demonstrated the superiority of the policy of national regional autonomy. Now, people can see more clearly the benefits of ethnic minority people living in the unified motherland family and implementing regional autonomy.

The main problem in implementing the policy of national regional autonomy in the future is to fully realize the autonomous rights of ethnic minorities, truly ensuring that ethnic minority people "are the masters of their own affairs" in managing local affairs within their own ethnic groups in various ethnic autonomous areas; at the same time, helping those ethnic minorities who have the conditions to establish autonomous areas but have not yet established autonomous areas to continue to establish autonomous areas.

Correctly understanding and handling the relationship between the unified leadership of the motherland and national regional autonomy is an extremely important issue in implementing the Party and government's policy of national regional autonomy. The national regional autonomy in our country is implemented within the unified motherland family, and the unification of the motherland is realized on the basis of national equality and unity. Only within the unified motherland family and under the unified leadership of the central and relevant higher-level state organs can we ensure that all ethnic groups develop along the track stipulated by the Constitution, and can we appropriately combine the local interests and current interests of all ethnic groups with the common interests and long-term interests of all ethnic groups. Only by respecting and guaranteeing the autonomous rights of the autonomous regions of all ethnic groups and taking into account the special interests and requirements of all ethnic groups can we give full play to the socialist enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic minorities. It can be seen that the relationship between unity and autonomy is complementary. It is wrong to inappropriately emphasize either aspect. At present, the main problem is that some higher-level state organs and Han cadres do not respect the autonomous rights of the autonomous regions enough, often overemphasizing the unity aspect and ignoring the autonomy aspect. Some Han cadres do not respect the powers of ethnic minority cadres enough in their work, do not consult with them enough when things happen, and the phenomenon of monopolizing and replacing them is still quite serious in some places. These situations must be corrected. However, the phenomenon of overemphasizing the particularity of autonomous regions and ignoring the unified leadership of the state, which exists in some ethnic minorities, is also wrong and harmful, and must also be corrected.

The nationalization of autonomous organs is the fundamental problem in realizing the autonomous rights of autonomous regions of all ethnic groups. The main contents of nationalization are the use of national forms, the use of national languages, and the appointment of national cadres, among which the most important is the appointment of local national cadres. In order to realize the nationalization of cadres of autonomous organs, we should vigorously train local national cadres to participate in various tasks so that they can assume more responsibilities. According to existing experience, the nationalization of cadres of autonomous organs must proceed from the actual situation of the autonomous regions of all ethnic groups and solve the problem realistically. The principle should be to ensure that the ethnic groups implementing regional autonomy can fully exercise their autonomous rights, and also to ensure the equal rights of other ethnic groups in the territory, so as to facilitate contact with the masses and promote various tasks in the local area. In addition to the cadres of the ethnic groups implementing regional autonomy, an appropriate number of cadres from the Han and other ethnic groups should be assigned. In autonomous areas where the Han people are in the majority, the degree of nationalization of organ cadres should not be too high, as being too high is detrimental to local national unity and the development of the autonomous region. The speed of nationalization of cadres of autonomous organs of all ethnic groups mainly depends on the growth of local national cadres and requires a gradual process.

The key to implementing the policy of national regional autonomy and further consolidating and building the socialist family of all ethnic groups lies in strengthening the Party's leadership on ethnic issues and resolutely opposing Han chauvinism and local nationalism.

The common characteristics of Han chauvinism and local nationalism are that they ignore the importance of equality, unity, mutual assistance, and cooperation among all ethnic groups, and do not treat and handle various issues among all ethnic groups in the motherland family based on the principles of national equality, unity, mutual assistance, and cooperation. The main manifestations of Han chauvinism are: ignoring the equal rights and autonomous rights of ethnic minorities; ignoring the important position of ethnic minorities in the socialist construction of the motherland; ignoring the characteristics of ethnic minorities and not caring about the difficulties and needs of ethnic minorities. The main manifestations of local nationalism are: ignoring the importance of all ethnic groups uniting in the motherland family; overemphasizing the partial interests of their own ethnic group and ignoring the overall interests of the country; being content with the status quo and ignoring the important significance of Han assistance. Han chauvinism and local nationalism are both manifestations of bourgeois ideology on ethnic issues, which are not conducive to the unification of the motherland and the unity of all ethnic groups, not conducive to the socialist construction of the motherland, and not conducive to the prosperity and development of all ethnic groups. In recent years, we have vigorously opposed Han chauvinism, which is completely necessary and correct, because the key to doing a good job in domestic ethnic relations lies in overcoming Han chauvinism, and we must continue to do so in the future. However, this does not mean that we can relax our vigilance against local nationalism, not conduct education, not criticize it, and not prevent and overcome it with a serious attitude. At present, Han chauvinism and local nationalism still exist seriously in some places, and in some areas, they have also grown to a certain extent in the past year or two. If we do not resolutely overcome them and allow them to develop, it will inevitably hinder our country's national unity and affect our country's socialist construction. It is very clear that if there is still a wrong attitude of Han chauvinism among the Han people and it is allowed to continue to develop, the mistake of national discrimination will definitely occur; on the other hand, if there is still a wrong attitude of local nationalism among the ethnic minorities and it is allowed to continue to develop, it will lead to the tendency of national separation. These two tendencies are mutually opposed and mutually influenced and are contradictions among the people that must be overcome. How to overcome this contradiction? It is necessary to proceed from the desire for national unity, and through criticism and self-criticism, to achieve further unity of all ethnic groups on a new basis. What is this new basis? It is to build a unified socialist family of all ethnic groups. The people of all ethnic groups must strengthen unity on this basis and oppose various nationalist tendencies. If ethnic minorities leave this foundation of unity to oppose Han chauvinism, they will consciously or unconsciously produce national separation phenomena; if the Han people leave this foundation of unity to oppose local nationalism, they will consciously or unconsciously produce national discrimination phenomena.

Han chauvinism and local nationalism both have their historical, social, and economic roots, and cannot be simply and uncritically opposed. They cannot be completely reversed by holding a few meetings and making a few reports. It is necessary to conduct analysis and research realistically and requires long-term efforts to overcome them. When opposing nationalist tendencies, it is necessary to distinguish right from wrong, distinguish between those who have this mistake and those who do not, distinguish between those with serious mistakes and those with minor mistakes, and should find out the subjective and objective reasons for this mistake, and propose ways to overcome this mistake. Do not arbitrarily label people with nationalism. Attention should be paid to protecting the enthusiasm of cadres in their work. Criticism must proceed from the desire for unity and be based on the principle of benefiting unity. Han cadres and people should pay attention to criticizing Han chauvinist tendencies and the mistakes of national discrimination more; ethnic minority cadres and people should criticize local nationalist tendencies more. Each side should criticize itself more and respect the other side, which can promote the other side's awareness, which is conducive to unity.

Education on the Party's policy of national equality and unity, strengthening internationalism and patriotism education, and strengthening socialist education must be conducted regularly for cadres and people of all ethnic groups. At the same time, the implementation of the Party and government's ethnic policies must be regularly checked, and combined with this check, appropriate criticism and self-criticism should be carried out. As long as everyone's awareness is raised, they will consciously and regularly pay attention to preventing and overcoming various forms of nationalist tendencies, and further enhance the great unity of the people of all ethnic groups in our country.

At present, the people of the whole country are carrying out a great struggle against the bourgeois rightists, which is a great socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. In this struggle, the people of all ethnic groups in our country must draw a clear line between right and wrong with the rightists and consolidate and strengthen the leadership of the proletariat. We believe that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the people of all ethnic groups in the country will work together with one heart and one mind, and we will certainly be able to build our country into a strong socialist country where all ethnic groups prosper and develop together.

    进一步增强民族团结
    今天本报发表了民族事务委员会和全国人民代表大会民族委员会在青岛召开民族工作座谈会的消息和国务院副总理、民族事务委员会主任乌兰夫同志在这个会议上的发言的要点。我们想利用这个机会，对当前民族工作的情况和任务，贡献一些意见。
    八年来，党和国家在民族工作方面的成就是伟大的。随着全国社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业的伟大胜利，已经有85％以上的少数民族人口的地区基本上实现了在生产资料所有制方面的社会主义改造，少数民族地区的经济和文化建设事业也有程度不同的发展，人民生活已经有了初步改善。民族区域自治政策的推行，已经获得很好的效果，全国有占少数民族聚居人口总数90％的地区，已经建立了自治地方和自治机关，少数民族干部已经由解放初期的一万多人，增加到三十四万多人，并且发展了四十多万共产党员和六十万共青团员。民族关系已经大大改善，和解放初期比较，历史上遗留下来的民族隔阂已经大大减少，各民族间的团结和互助已经大大加强，从而使我们这个统一的各民族大家庭更加巩固了。
    现在，我国各民族正在处在一个历史上空前未有的大改造和大建设的时期，我们的目标是建立一个没有人剥削人的各民族共同发展和繁荣的强大的社会主义工业国，从根本上改变我国各民族在经济上和文化上的落后面貌。社会主义是我国各族人民获得彻底解放的唯一道路，也是各民族获得繁荣和发展的唯一道路。只有坚决走社会主义的路，才能使各民族得到共同的繁荣和发展。过去，我国许多少数民族之所以走向衰弱，经济不发展，人口也在逐年减少，主要原因就是由于近百年来帝国主义对我国各民族人民的侵略和国内反动统治阶级对少数民族采取压迫、剥削政策的结果。他们的政策不是使各民族共同繁荣和发展的政策，而是使各民族衰亡和削弱的政策。中国共产党从它诞生之日起，就反对民族压迫，主张民族平等，为达到各民族的共同发展和繁荣而奋斗。中国共产党的民族政策，就是各民族繁荣和发展的政策，社会主义的道路就是各民族发展和繁荣的道路。任何一个民族要到社会主义，都必须经过社会改革（包括民主改革和社会主义改造）。因为只有经过改革，建立起社会主义的经济制度和政治制度，才能彻底解放生产力，才能为经济和文化的发展开辟广阔的道路。各民族在改革的时间上可以有先有后，在改革的步骤上可以有缓有急，在改革的具体方式上也应当根据各民族的情况不同而有所区别，但是改革却是任何一个民族都不可避免的。很难设想，不经过改革，可以在封建所有制、奴隶所有制以至原始落后的生产方式的基础之上建立起社会主义社会来。现在，我国的汉族地区和绝大部分少数民族地区都已经在生产资料所有制方面取得了社会主义改造的胜利，但是，还有一小部分少数民族地区没有完成或者没有开始实行社会改革。这些地区也将在今后若干年内，分别根据当地民族的不同情况，逐步完成民主改革和社会主义改造，就是已经基本上实现了生产资料社会主义所有制的地区，也还需要一个继续建立和巩固社会主义制度的过程。很难设想，在全国其他民族地区都已经进行了改革，只有某些民族地区可以永远不进行改革，可以永远处于落后状态。也很难设想，不经过一定时期艰苦、深入的工作就可以把新的社会主义制度巩固起来。有些人担心实行改革和改造的结果，“就会使民族没有了”；这是一种过虑，也是一种误解。很明显，在社会主义改造胜利之后，各民族的生产资料所有制和上层建筑是改变了，但是民族仍然存在着，改变的只是那些旧有的不适合各民族向前发展进步的东西，而建立起来的却是崭新的社会。社会主义改造不但不会消灭各民族，而且会使各民族空前地繁荣和发展起来。现在不是民族消灭问题，而是各民族共同发展和共同繁荣的问题。
    随着我国社会主义改造和建设事业的向前发展，我国各民族之间经济和文化的联系将越来越密切，各民族之间的互相接近和互相影响也将越来越多。这种情况是不是可怕呢？应当认识，各民族之间的互相接近、互相影响的加强，这是我国革命胜利和建设事业发展的结果，是社会向前发展中的必然趋势。只要社会在继续向前发展，各民族自己也在不断地向前进步，那么各民族之间的互相接近和互相影响，以及互相接受彼此的优良历史文化传统和先进经验的可能性也会愈来愈大，民族之间的共同的东西，就会愈来愈多，民族之间的差别也就会越来越少，越来越小一些。这丝毫没有什么可怕，而正是各民族发展进步所要求的可喜现象。
    在我国社会主义改造和社会主义建设的伟大事业中，我们最需要的是什么呢？是不断地巩固祖国的统一和增强各民族的团结。毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”一文中说：“国家的统一，人民的团结，国内各民族的团结，这是我们的事业必定要胜利的基本保证。”
    我国各民族团结在一个统一的大家庭里，这是历史发展的自然结果。因此，我们有各种有利的条件来不断地增强各民族的团结、友好关系。
    第一，我国各少数民族人民同汉族人民在长期以来是有共同命运的。在解放以前，少数民族人民不但在国内同汉族人民一道受着汉族反动统治者的压迫，对外也同汉族人民一道受着帝国主义的侵略和压迫。解放以后，我们推翻了压在中国人民头上的三座大山——帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的反动统治，消灭了国内的民族压迫制度。但是，帝国主义对我国各族人民侵略的威胁仍然存在。直到现在，美帝国主义仍然霸占着我国的台湾，以美国为首的帝国主义还在利用一切机会妄图分裂和破坏我国的统一和各民族的团结。
    第二，我国人口有六亿，土地有九百六十多万平方公里。在全国人口中，少数民族虽然只占总人口的6％，并且政治、经济和文化上一般也比较汉族要不发展一些，但是居住地区面积广大，约占我国总面积的50％—60％，并且资源丰富，工农牧业的发展潜力很大，在祖国的社会主义建设事业中占有重要地位。汉族的居住地区虽然只占全国总面积的40％—50％，但是汉族的人口众多，政治、经济、文化也比较发展，在我们的国家生活中处于主导地位。汉族和各少数民族只有亲密团结，互相支持，互助合作，取长补短，才能把我国建设成为一个各民族共同发展、繁荣幸福的社会主义强国。
    第三，我国各民族的分布情况互相交插，大多数少数民族和汉族杂居在一起，各少数民族也多是互相交错居住的。许多少数民族都是大分散，小集中，完全是某一个民族聚居的地方很少。例如新疆这样少数民族比较集中居住的地方，也有十三种有一定聚居区的民族。
    第四，在长期的历史发展中，我们各民族之间发展了经济上的合作和文化上的交流，就是在历史上反动统治实行民族压迫的年代里，这种经济上的联系和文化上的交流也仍然得到了发展。特别是在最近几十年来，中国共产党领导的人民民主革命运动，更把我国各民族人民的命运联系在一起，形成为一种密切不可分离的联系。上述这些情况，使我国各民族完全有必要和可能生活在一个统一的解放了的祖国大家庭内，在平等的基础上团结起来。
    由于汉族的发展水平一般走在各少数民族的前面，并且在历史上汉族的统治阶级，曾经长期统治和压迫过少数民族，致使有些少数民族被挤到自然条件很差的地区，使他们的发展受到了很大限制。这种情况，就使我们在全国解放以后，实行民族平等政策的时候必须加以照顾，就使汉族更有责任对少数民族采取主动团结和积极帮助的态度。帮助少数民族发展，是汉族人民不可推卸的光荣的义务。少数民族对这种帮助应当采取欢迎态度。
    民族平等是民族团结的基础。为了进一步增强我国的民族团结，建设我国各民族的社会主义大家庭，就必须继续贯彻执行民族区域自治政策，充分保证少数民族的平等权利和聚居的少数民族自治权利。几年来推行民族区域自治政策的经验证明，民族的区域自治是完全适合我国各民族的历史发展和当前情况的，是最有利于实行各民族间的团结互助，发展各民族的政治、经济、文化的。内蒙古自治区、新疆维吾尔自治区和其他许多少数民族自治地方，工、农、牧业生产的迅速发展和人民生活显著改善的事实，就无可争辩地说明了民族区域自治政策的优越性。现在，人们都可以更加清楚地看到少数民族人民生活在统一的祖国大家庭内实行区域自治的好处。
    今后在执行民族区域自治政策方面的主要问题是：充分实现少数民族的自治权利，真正作到少数民族人民在各民族自治地方自己“当家作主”管理本民族内部地方性的事务；同时，帮助那些有条件建立自治地方、但是还没有建立自治地方的少数民族继续建立起自治地方。
    正确认识和处理祖国的统一领导和民族区域自治的关系，是贯彻执行党和政府的民族区域自治政策的一个极为重要的问题。我国的民族区域自治是在统一的祖国大家庭内实行的，祖国的统一是在民族平等团结的基础上实现的，只有在统一的祖国大家庭内，在中央和有关上级国家机关的统一领导之下，才能保证各民族按照宪法所规定的轨道向前发展，才能使各民族的局部利益、当前利益和各民族的共同利益、长远利益适当地结合起来。只有尊重和保障各民族自治地方的自治权利，照顾了各民族的特殊利益和要求，才能充分发挥各少数民族人民的社会主义积极性。可见统一和自治的关系是相辅相成的。不适当地强调那一方面都是不对的。目前主要的问题是，有些上级国家机关和汉族干部对自治地方的自治权利尊重不够，往往过分强调统一的一面，忽视自治的一面。有些汉族干部在工作中对少数民族干部的职权尊重不够，遇事同他们协商不够，包办代替的现象在有些地方还相当严重。这些情况必须加以纠正。但是，在有些少数民族中存在的过分强调自治地方的特殊，忽视国家的统一领导的现象，也是错误的，有害的，也必须加以纠正。
    自治机关的民族化是实现各民族自治地方自治权利的根本问题。民族化的主要内容是运用民族形式，使用民族语文，任用民族干部，其中最重要的是任用当地民族干部。为了实现自治机关干部民族化，应当大力培养当地民族干部参加各种工作，使他们能够担负更多的责任。根据已有经验，自治机关的干部民族化，必须从各民族自治地方的实际情况出发，实事求是地加以解决。应当以既能保证实行区域自治的民族充分行使自治权利，又能保证境内其他民族的平等权利，便于联系群众，推行当地各项工作为原则。除了实行区域自治的民族干部以外，应当配备适当数量的汉族和其他民族的干部。在那些汉族占多数的自治地方，机关干部民族化的程度不宜过高，过高了对当地的民族团结和自治地方的发展都是不利的。派往民族自治地方工作的汉族干部，应当继续坚持“少而精”的原则。至于各民族自治机关干部民族化的速度，则主要取决于当地民族干部成长的情况，需要有一个逐步实现的过程。
    贯彻民族区域自治政策，进一步巩固和建设各民族的社会主义大家庭的关键，在于加强党在民族问题方面的领导，坚决反对大汉族主义和地方民族主义。
    大汉族主义和地方民族主义的共同特点，是忽视各民族间的平等团结和互助合作的重要性，不以民族平等团结、互助合作的原则来对待和处理祖国大家庭中各民族间的各种问题。大汉族主义的主要表现是：忽视少数民族的平等权利和自治权利；忽视少数民族在祖国社会主义建设事业中的重要地位；忽视少数民族特点和不关心少数民族的疾苦和需要。地方民族主义的主要表现是：忽视各民族团结在祖国大家庭中的重要性；过分强调本民族的局部利益，忽视国家的整体利益；故步自封，忽视汉族帮助的重要意义。大汉族主义和地方民族主义都是资产阶级思想在民族问题上的表现，都不利于祖国的统一和各民族的团结，不利于祖国的社会主义建设，不利于各民族的繁荣和发展。几年来，我们大力地反对了大汉族主义，这是完全必要的，正确的，因为搞好国内民族关系的关键在于克服大汉族主义，今后仍然必须坚持地这样去做。但是，这决不是说，对地方民族主义就可以放松警惕，不进行教育，不加以批判，不以严肃态度去加以防止和克服。现在，大汉族主义和地方民族主义在部分地方都还严重地存在着，在某些地区，近一、两年来，并且还有一定程度的滋长。如果不坚决地加以克服，任其发展下去，就势必会妨害我国的民族团结，影响我国的社会主义建设事业。很明显，如果在汉族中还有大汉族主义的错误态度，并且让它继续发展下去，民族歧视的错误就一定会发生；另一方面，如果在少数民族中还有地方民族主义的错误态度，并且让它继续发展下去，就会产生民族分离的倾向。这两种倾向是互相对立的，并且是互相影响着的，是一种必须克服的人民内部的矛盾。怎样克服这种矛盾呢？就是要从民族团结的愿望出发，经过批评和自我批评，在新的基础上达到各民族的进一步团结。这个新的基础是什么呢？就是建设统一的社会主义的各民族大家庭。各族人民都必须在这个基础上加强团结，反对各种民族主义倾向。少数民族如果离开了这个团结的基础去反对大汉族主义，就会自觉或不自觉地产生民族分离现象；汉族如果离开这个团结的基础去反对地方民族主义，就会自觉或不自觉地产生民族歧视现象。
    大汉族主义和地方民族主义都有它产生的历史的、社会的和经济的根源，不能简单地、不加分析地去加以反对，也不是开几次会、做几个报告就可以完全反掉了的。必须实事求是地进行分析、研究，并且需要经过长期的努力，才能加以克服。在反对民族主义倾向的时候，必须分清是非，区别有这种错误的人和没有这种错误的人，区别错误严重的和错误轻微的，并且应当找出产生这种错误的主观的和客观的原因，提出克服这种错误的办法，不能随便乱戴民族主义的帽子。应当注意保护干部在工作中的积极性。批评必须从团结的愿望出发，以有利于团结为原则。汉族的干部和人民，应当注意多批评大汉族主义倾向，多批评民族歧视的错误；少数民族的干部和人民，应当多批评地方民族主义倾向。每一方面都多批评自己，尊重对方，就可以推动对方的觉悟，这样就有利于团结。
    对各族干部和人民必须经常地进行党的民族平等团结政策的教育，加强国际主义和爱国主义的教育，加强社会主义的教育。同时，必须定期地检查党和政府的民族政策的执行情况，并且结合这种检查，开展适当的批评和自我批评。只要大家的觉悟提高了，就会自觉地、经常地去注意防止和克服各种形式的民族主义倾向，进一步增强我国各民族人民的伟大团结。
    现在，全国人民正在开展反对资产阶级右派分子的伟大斗争，这是在政治战线上和思想战线上的伟大的社会主义革命。在这次斗争中，我国各族人民必须和右派分子划清大是大非的界限，巩固和加强无产阶级的领导权。我们相信，在中国共产党的领导下，全国各族人民同心协力，就一定能够把我国建设成为一个各民族共同繁荣和发展的、强大的社会主义国家。
