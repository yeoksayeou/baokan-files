　　American Vulture and "Chick"
　　After the major American conspiracy to subvert the current Syrian regime was revealed, American legislators began to complain that the US government had made a serious mistake in the Middle East. On August 20, US Senator Wayne Morse rebuked the US government in the Senate, saying that as a result of the Eisenhower Doctrine passed last winter, the situation in Syria meant that "the chickens have come home to roost."

　　Morse's meaningful remark not only exposed the less-than-ideal situation of goods manufactured in the American black shop being peddled in the Middle East, but also illustrated that the US's various plans and actions towards the Middle East and Syria could not stand the light of day. The "chicken" Morse referred to is Syria. The so-called "roost" refers to Syria's just stance of opposing colonialism and striving for national independence.

　　As everyone knows, since the failure of the British-French invasion of Egypt, the American vulture, draped in the beautiful feathers of the "Eisenhower Doctrine," has been hovering over the Middle East. It clamors about the so-called "international communist threat," wanting to use this to frighten Middle Eastern countries, entice them to abandon their firm stance of national independence, change their active neutral foreign policy, and get closer to the United States. In the end, the American vulture can easily catch these "chicks" with its sharp claws and devour them alive.

　　However, the American vulture's wishful thinking did not come true. The result of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" being promoted in the Middle East is that the countries in the Middle East that insist on independence have more clearly recognized the hideous face of the American colonists, and realized that what threatens the Middle East is not "communism" but American imperialism. As early as January this year, the Syrian government solemnly pointed out that there is no international communist threat to Syria's security and independence, and that the root cause of conflicts in Arab lands, as well as the threat of aggression that may arise in this region, comes from imperialism! And the American conspiracy to subvert Syria has further strengthened Syria's nationalistic stance. Therefore, Senator Morse lamented that Syria, this "chicken, has returned to its roost." According to Morse's opinion, it seems that if the United States had not put up the banner of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" and instead acted secretly and silently, it might have been able to eat the "chicken" of Syria.

　　However, whether it is Morse or Dulles, they are all wrong. Syria is by no means a "chicken" that can be picked up at will from the American aggressive group's banquet table. It is a proud, freedom-loving eagle in the Arab world. Let the hungry American vultures screech and hover in the skies of the Middle East! Facts will prove who will be the strong and victorious one in the storms of the Middle East!

### 美国兀鹰和“小鸡”

　　美国兀鹰和“小鸡”
    美国策划颠覆叙利亚现政权的大阴谋被揭露以后，美国的议员们就纷纷埋怨美国政府在中东犯了严重错误。8月20日，美国参议员韦恩·莫尔斯在参议院责骂美国政府说，由于去年冬季通过了艾森豪威尔主义的结果，叙利亚的局势意味着“小鸡又回到老窝里去了”。
    莫尔斯的这句意味深长的话，不仅暴露了美国黑店里所制造出来的货色在中东兜售的情况不太美妙，而且也说明了美国对中东和叙利亚的种种打算和所作所为是见不得阳光的。莫尔斯所指的“小鸡”就是叙利亚。所谓“老窝”，是指叙利亚的反对殖民主义、争取民族独立的正义立场。
    大家知道，自从英法侵略埃及失败之后，美国这只兀鹰就披着“艾森豪威尔主义”的漂亮羽毛，一直盘旋在中东的上空。它叫嚣着所谓“国际共产主义威胁”，想以此吓倒中东国家，诱使它们放弃民族独立的坚定立场，改变它们积极中立的外交政策，靠拢美国。最后美国兀鹰就能用它的利爪轻而易举地捉住这些“小鸡”，把它们活活地吞食掉。
    但是，美国兀鹰的如意算盘并没有打中。“艾森豪威尔主义”在中东推行的结果，只是使得中东的坚持独立的国家更加清楚地认识了美国殖民者的狰狞面貌，认识到威胁中东的不是什么“共产主义”而是美帝国主义。早在今年1月，叙利亚政府就严正指出，对叙利亚的安全和独立并不存在什么国际共产主义的威胁，而在阿拉伯国土上发生冲突的根源，以及对这个地区可能产生的侵略威胁，都是来自帝国主义方面的！”而美国颠覆叙利亚的阴谋，更使叙利亚坚定了自己的民族主义的立场。因此，参议员莫尔斯惋惜地说，叙利亚这只“小鸡又回到老窝去了”。照莫尔斯的意见，似乎美国要是不打出“艾森豪威尔主义”的旗号，而是不动声色地偷偷干，也许倒能把叙利亚这只“小鸡”吃到嘴里。
    可是，无论是莫尔斯或者杜勒斯，他们全都看错了。叙利亚决不是美国侵略集团餐席上的一只可以随手掂来的“小鸡”。它是阿拉伯世界里的一只骄傲的爱好自由的雄鹰。让馋得发慌的美国兀鹰在中东的上空高叫和盘旋吧！事实将会证明，在中东的风云里，谁将是矫健的胜利者！
