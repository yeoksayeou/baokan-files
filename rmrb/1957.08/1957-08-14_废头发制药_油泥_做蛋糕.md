Waste Hair for Pharmaceuticals
"Oil Sludge" for Cakes
    Pig hair and sheep wool can be used to make daily necessities and woolen fabrics. But what is the use of a strand of waste hair? Now, Tianjin Daling Pharmaceutical Factory has been trial-producing cystine injections from the protein extracted from waste hair. Chemical tests have proved that waste hair contains 11% to 12% protein, which is the raw material for manufacturing cystine, a medicine for nutrition and eliminating fatigue.
    Recently, technicians from Tianjin Municipal Oil and Fat Chemical Industry Company discovered that in the process of refining peanut oil, soybean oil, or rapeseed oil, a kind of vegetable oil precipitate - "oil sludge" - is separated out, which contains lecithin, a phospholipid composed of oil and egg yolk. Extracting the phospholipids and mixing them with cream and eggs to make cakes or ice cream is both delicious and nutritious. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    废头发制药
    “油泥”做蛋糕
    猪毛、羊毛能做日用品和毛料；可是一根废头发又有什么用呢？现在天津大林制药厂已经用废头发中提炼出来的蛋白质试生产胱氨酸注射剂。经过化验证明，废头发中含有11％到12％的蛋白质，这种蛋白质是制造营养和消除疲劳的药品——胱氨酸的原料。
    最近天津市油脂化学工业公司的技术人员发现：在精制花生油、豆油或菜籽油的过程中，会分离出一种植物油沉淀物——“油泥”，它含有有油和蛋黄素的磷脂；把磷脂提炼出来，掺合在奶油和鸡蛋里做蛋糕或冰搅凌，既好吃营养又丰富。　　　（据新华社讯）
