Xinhua News Agency, August 25th: The US State Department issued a press release on August 22nd, announcing that it would allow twenty-four American reporters to come to China for interviews.

　　The US State Department's practice of prohibiting American reporters from coming to China for interviews has aroused strong opposition from the American people and public opinion. Now, the US State Department's permission for a limited number of American reporters to come to China for interviews does not in the slightest indicate that the US government has changed its consistent policy of hostility towards New China. This action by the US State Department is merely a deceptive tactic adopted under strong pressure at home and abroad, attempting to divert the attention of the American people and public opinion to the Chinese government. However, according to the principle of equality and mutual benefit, allowing reporters from both sides to be stationed in each other's countries to report news, in order to enhance mutual understanding between the people of all countries, is a well-known international practice. Under the test of this international practice, the US State Department's deceptive tactics will soon be completely exposed.

　　The US State Department's press release is full of malicious attacks on China. The press release slandered that the Chinese government "has not respected its guarantees to allow American citizens imprisoned by them to return home," "insists on refusing to abide by the practices of civilized national governments," and "has failed to treat American citizens according to the code of conduct recognized by civilized nations."

　　The press release revealed the US State Department's purpose in deciding to send American reporters to China. The press release said that due to "the emergence of some new factors, it is appropriate for the American people to obtain further information about the current situation in China." The press release did not specify what these "new factors" were, but US State Department spokesman White hinted in answering questions that the US government was particularly interested in the rampant attacks launched by right-wing elements in China against the socialist system and the leadership of the Communist Party during the rectification campaign. The press release also said that one of the "hopes" of sending American reporters to China was that they could report on the situation of American prisoners imprisoned for violating Chinese law.

　　The press release said arbitrarily: "Needless to say, the United States will not grant reciprocal visas to Chinese people holding passports issued by the Chinese Communist regime." The press release also emphasized: "In general, travel by Americans in areas currently under Communist rule in China is still inconsistent with American policy, or is illegal." This shows that the US government still insists on its policy of obstructing mutual exchanges between the people of China and the United States in order to enhance mutual understanding.

　  准许美记者访华　拒绝我记者访美
　　美政府玩弄手段欺骗舆论
　　阴谋继续阻挠中美两国人民往来
    新华社25日讯　美国国务院在8月22日发表新闻公报，宣布将准许二十四名美国记者来中国采访。
    美国国务院禁止美国记者来中国采访的做法，曾经引起美国人民和公众舆论的强烈反对。现在，美国国务院准许人数有限的美国记者来中国采访，丝毫也不表明美国政府已经改变了它一贯敌视新中国的政策。美国国务院的这一行动，只是在国内外强大压力下所采取的欺骗手法，企图把美国人民和公众舆论的注意力转向中国政府。但是，根据平等互惠的原则，容许双方记者驻在对方国家报道新闻，以增进各国人民的互相了解，这是人所共知的国际惯例。在这个国际惯例的考验下，美国国务院的欺骗手法，将会很快地完全败露。
    美国国务院的新闻公报充满了对中国的恶毒攻击。公报诬蔑说，中国政府“没有尊重它所作的允许被他们监禁的美国公民返国的保证”，“坚持拒绝遵照文明国家政府的惯例行事”，“没有能够根据文明国家确认了的行为准则对待美国公民”。
    公报透露了美国国务院决定派遣美国记者到中国来的目的。公报说，由于“出现了一些新的因素，因而宜于使美国人民得到关于中国国内现状的进一步情报”。公报没有说明这些“新的因素”是什么，但是，美国国务院发言人怀特在答复问题的时候暗示，美国政府对于中国国内右派分子在整风期间对社会主义制度和共产党领导所进行的猖狂进攻，特别感到兴趣。公报又说，派遣美国记者到中国来的“希望之一”是他们能报道违反中国法律而被监禁的美国犯人的情况。
    公报蛮横地说：“不用说，美国不会给持有中国共产党政权发给的护照的中国人以互惠的签证。”公报还强调指出：“一般说，美国人在目前处于共产党统治下的中国地区旅行仍旧是不符合美国的政策的，或者说是不合法的。”这就表明美国政府至今仍然坚持阻挠中美两国人民互相来往以增进彼此了解的政策。
