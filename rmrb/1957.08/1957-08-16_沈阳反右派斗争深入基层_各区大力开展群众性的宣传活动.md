Shenyang (By Our Correspondent) - The anti-Rightist struggle in Shenyang City has now penetrated to the grassroots level in various districts. In mid-July, nine district-level organizations and their more than nine hundred affiliated units in the city successively exposed a batch of Rightist elements. The Casting Research Institute of Heping District exposed Chen Ruyu, a Rightist element who had consistently been anti-Communist. Before liberation, he had organized reactionary groups, understood our military intelligence around Jiangyin, and concealed special agents sent from enemy-occupied islands along the coast. When the rectification began, he insisted that the root cause of the three evils was the social system, and he used the discontent of some people in the institute who had not yet been assigned work to incite everyone to cause trouble. The Sujiatun District People's Committee and the Sujiatun District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party exposed Rightist elements Chi Deren and Liu Yanxin, who demanded that the Party issue an order to dissolve the cooperatives. In order to educate the masses to recognize the true face of the Rightists, the district committees also made full use of propaganda tools such as slides, mobile exhibitions, and picture columns to carry out propaganda to the broad masses of residents. In Heping and four other districts alone, 300,000 residents have been educated. Shenhe, Sujiatun and four other districts have specially trained more than 1,000 reporters for this purpose.

    沈阳反右派斗争深入基层
    各区大力开展群众性的宣传活动
    本报讯  沈阳市反右派斗争目前已经深入到各区基层。7月中旬，全市九个区级机关和所属九百多单位先后揭发出一批右派分子。和平区铸造研究所揭发出一个一贯反共的右派分子陈如玉，他在解放前曾组织反动集团，了解我江阴一带军事情报，掩藏过沿海敌占岛屿派来的特务。整风开始，他一口咬定三害根源是社会制度，并利用所里一些人对暂时没有分配工作的不满情绪，煽动大家起来闹事。苏家屯区人民委员会和中共苏家屯区委揭发右派分子迟德仁、刘延信，他们要求党下命令解散合作社。为了教育群众认清右派真面目，各区委还充分利用幻灯、流动展览、画栏等宣传工具，向广大居民进行宣传，仅和平等五个区，受过教育的居民已达三十万人。沈河、苏家屯等四个区为此专门训练了一千多名报告员。
