Xinhua News Agency, 18th. The head of the Japanese Agricultural Technology Delegation to China, Hisayoshi Muramatsu, said he is deeply convinced that China's politics will be further consolidated and its economy will be further developed.

Muramatsu, along with delegation secretary-general Suematsu Tazaki, delegation members Ikuei Ohashi, Katsuo Nagasawa, and Noboru Yamada, spoke to Xinhua reporters at the Beijing Hotel on the 17th about their observations during this visit to China.

Muramatsu is a member of the Japanese House of Representatives and former Chairman of the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Committee. He said: "In the Chinese countryside, you can no longer see the tragic scenes that were seen in books in the past: farmers suffering from exploitation by landlords and low productivity. Now, agricultural cooperatives are enthusiastically producing and have achieved increased production, implementing distribution according to work; this is vastly different from the past." He said that he saw workers and peasants everywhere enthusiastically discussing how to increase production, which is an example of democratic life. Production has a certain plan, but this is not coercion but guidance.

Muramatsu also expressed his belief that friendly exchanges between China and Japan will be strengthened day by day. He said that although diplomatic relations have not yet been restored, this should not be an obstacle to technical and cultural exchanges. The majority of the Japanese people are now working hard for this. He also said that the delegation will convey the deep affection they felt during this visit to China to the Japanese people.

Secretary-General Tazaki visited China in 1940. He said that he saw great changes in New China this time. Unlike all previous dynastic changes, the Chinese people are now united together.

Ohashi said that he studies rural economics and had previously investigated rural economics in China. At that time, the countryside was unstable, and farmers were unable to resist natural disasters. His strong feeling this time is that farmers can live and produce stably, and production has developed. Stability is something that China has not had in the past hundred years, but now it has, which is a political success. Ohashi said that as a neighbor, he is concerned about maintaining a balance in China's industrial and agricultural production. For example, he feels that there are still too few chemical fertilizers during the Second Five-Year Plan period. He said that he is not only concerned, but also willing to help.

Fruit tree expert Nagasawa talked about the lives of fruit farmers he saw in the Northeast. He said: "Fruit tree production has developed there, many new houses have been built in the village, and he saw that members of the agricultural cooperative eat and dress better than in the past."

Yamada talked about his feelings when he saw Shanghai from the top of the Shanghai Mansion. He said that the colonial feeling of old Shanghai is gone, and the Chinese people have washed away the dust of history and are building with a bright and joyful mood, to build their country more beautifully. Chinese politics is composed of this mood of the people across the country, which is democratic politics.

    日本农业技术访华团人员发表观感
    团长村松久义说：各地工人农民都在热情地讨论怎样增产，这就是民主生活的实例。
    新华社18日讯　日本农业技术访华团团长村松久义说，他对新中国政治将进一步巩固，经济将进一步发展深信不疑。
    村松和访华团秘书长田崎末松、团员大桥育英、永泽胜雄、山田登一起，17日在北京饭店向新华社记者谈了他们这次访华的观感。
    村松是日本众议院议员、前农林水产委员长。他说：中国农村已经看不到像过去从书本上看到的：农民遭受地主剥削和生产力不高的悲惨景象了。现在农业社热情生产，得到了增产，实行了按劳分配；这与过去有天壤之别。他说，他在各地看到工人、农民都在热情地讨论怎样增产，这就是民主生活的实例。生产都有一定的计划，但这不是强制而是指导。
    村松还表示相信中日友好往来将一天天加强。他说，现在国交未恢复，但并不能成为技术、文化交流的阻碍。现在日本大多数国民都在为此努力。他还说，访华团要把这次来中国所深深感到的深情厚意传达给日本人民。
    秘书长田崎1940年到过中国，他说他这次看到新中国变化很大。和过去一切改朝换代不同，现在中国人民大众团结在一起了。
    大桥说，他是研究农村经济的，过去在中国调查过农村经济，那时农村是不安定的，农民无力抗拒自然灾害。这次他的强烈的感受是农民能够安定的生活和生产，生产发展了。安定是过去中国一百年来所没有的，现在有了，这是政治上一个成功。大桥说，作为一个邻人，他对中国工农业生产保持均衡表示关心。比如他感到第二个五年计划时期的化学肥料仍然太少。他说他不仅是关心，而且愿有所帮助。
    果树专家永泽谈了他在东北所看到的果农的生活。他说：那里果树生产发展了，村里建了不少新住宅，他看到农业社社员吃穿都比过去好了。
    山田谈了他在上海大厦顶看上海时的心情。他说，旧上海的那种殖民地感觉没有了，中国人民洗了历史的尘埃，以明朗喜悦的心情建设着，要把自己的国家建设得更美丽。中国政治就是全国人民这一心情所组成，这就是民主政治。
