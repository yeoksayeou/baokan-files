Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 7th - Farmers in the early rice-harvesting areas of Sichuan Province are enthusiastically delivering new grain. According to statistics from the Sichuan Provincial Grain Bureau, in the ten days following the early rice harvest in late July, the province purchased more than 97 million jin of new grain.

This year, Sichuan's early rice and various spring crops have achieved bumper harvests. However, before July, the progress of summer grain procurement was slower than last year. The main reason was the resurgence of capitalist ideology in rural areas, with some farmers taking grain to the free grain market for resale, and grain merchants and brokers taking the opportunity to cause trouble. In response to this situation, relevant departments conducted patriotic education among farmers on handing over public grain and selling surplus grain before the new grain entered the market. Many agricultural cooperative members recognized the importance of selling grain early to support socialist construction and aid farmers in disaster areas, and thus competed to sell surplus grain.

    四川农民争先卖新粮
    新华社成都7日电　四川省早稻丰收地区农民踊跃交售新粮。据四川省粮食厅统计，全省7月下旬在早稻收割后的十天内，就收购新粮九千七百多万斤。
    今年四川早稻和各项小春作物获得丰收。但是在7月份以前，夏粮征购进度却比去年迟缓。主要原因是农村中资本主义思想又在抬头，部分农民拿粮食向粮食自由市场倒贩，粮商粮贩也乘机捣乱。有关部门针对这种情况，在新粮上市前就向农民进行了交公粮卖余粮的爱国教育。许多农业社社员认识了早卖粮食对支援社会主义建设、支援灾区农民的重要意义，因而争先出卖余粮。
