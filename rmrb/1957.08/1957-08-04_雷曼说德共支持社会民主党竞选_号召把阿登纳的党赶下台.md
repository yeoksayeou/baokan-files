Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 3rd: According to a report from the German News Agency, the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party, Lehmann, delivered a speech on Democratic German Radio on the evening of August 1st. He said that the reason the Communists are now being asked to vote for the Social Democratic candidates is not to express belief in the Social Democratic Party, but because these extra million votes can play a decisive role in ousting Adenauer's party.

Lehmann said that the German Communist Party's decision has already caused great confusion in Adenauer's party ranks, but he also warned against having any illusions about the outcome of the election or the developments after the election. We hope that a result will be produced: the formation of a government led by the Social Democratic Party, excluding the Christian Democratic Union - Christian Social Union.

Lehmann pointed out that decisively defeating Adenauer's party in the election is a major political task for the people of West Germany. He said that the Communists' participation in the election struggle, their struggle to strive for unity of action, especially unity of action with the Social Democrats, is all for this purpose.

Lehmann said that if all parties opposed to Adenauer's policies, including the German Communist Party, the Social Democratic Party, the Free Democratic Party, the Federalist Union, and the German Union, all fought for a common goal: to defeat Adenauer's party in the election and to achieve a new path leading to understanding and peace, then this would mean a major development in West Germany, in all of Germany, and in Europe.

    雷曼说德共支持社会民主党竞选
    号召把阿登纳的党赶下台
    新华社柏林3日电　据德意志通讯社消息：德国共产党中央委员会第一书记雷曼8月1日晚间在民主德国电台上发表演说。他说，现在所以要求共产党人投社会民主党候选人的票，并不是要表示相信社会民主党，而是因为这额外的一百万张选票对于把阿登纳的党赶下台能够起决定性的作用。
    雷曼说，德国共产党的这个决定已经在阿登纳的党的队伍中引起了很大的混乱，但是他同时警告说，不要对选举的结果或者对选举后事态的发展抱任何幻想。我们希望会产生这样一种结果：成立一个以社会民主党为领导的，不包括基督教民主联盟——基督教社会联盟的政府。
    雷曼指出，在选举中决定性地打败阿登纳的党是西德人民重大的政治任务。他说，共产党人参加选举斗争，他们争取行动一致，特别是同社会民主党人行动一致的斗争都是为这个目的服务的。
    雷曼说，如果所有反对阿登纳的政策的党派包括德国共产党、社会民主党、自由民主党、联邦主义联盟和日尔曼人联盟都为一个共同的目标而奋斗：在选举中击败阿登纳的党和实现一条导向谅解和获得和平的新途径，那么这在西德、在整个德国和欧洲会意味着一个重大的发展。
