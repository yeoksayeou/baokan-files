Xinhua News Agency, August 3rd dispatch from Washington: The United States Senate passed an amendment to the government's civil rights bill on August 2nd by a vote of 51 to 42, thereby stripping the government's proposed civil rights bill of what little positive significance it originally had.

According to the original bill, federal judges could sentence those who infringed on black voting rights to imprisonment or fines without a jury trial. The amendment, however, requires a jury trial for conviction.

It is pointed out that in the southern states of the United States, juries are usually composed of racists, who are unlikely to protect the rights of black voters.

This amendment was passed with the strong support of Southern Democratic senators.

The Eisenhower administration originally wanted to use the civil rights bill to accumulate some political capital for the Republican Party, but this action by the Senate negated his plan. Senate Republican Leader Knowland said that the amendment was "a fatal blow" to the entire civil rights bill. Vice President Nixon also said, "This is one of the most painful days in the history of the Senate, because this vote is a vote against voting rights."

The Senate also passed another amendment last week by a vote of 52 to 38, limiting federal enforcement authority to voting rights issues, while the original bill stipulated that enforcement authority could be applied to general civil rights, including racial segregation in public schools, etc.

### 美参院破坏民权法案  通过修正案侵犯黑人投票权

    美参院破坏民权法案
    通过修正案侵犯黑人投票权
    新华社3日讯　华盛顿消息：美国参议院8月2日以五十一票对四十二票通过了一项对政府民权法案的修正案，从而使政府提出的民权法案失去了原来多少还有的一点点积极意义。
    按照原来的法案，联邦法官可以不经过陪审团对侵犯黑人投票权的人判以徒刑或罚款。修正案却要求在判罪时必须通过陪审团。
    据指出，在美国南部各州，陪审团通常都由种族主义分子组成，它不可能卫护黑人选民的权利。
    这个修正案是在南方民主党议员极力支持下获得通过的。
    艾森豪威尔政府本来想利用民权法案来为共和党积累一点政治资本，但是，参议院的这一行动否定了他的这种打算。参议院共和党领袖诺兰说，修正案是对整个民权法案的“一个致命的打击”。副总统尼克松也说，“这是参议院历史上最惨痛的日子之一，因为这次表决是一次反对投票权的表决”。
    参议院在上星期也曾经以五十二票对三十八票通过另一个修正案，把联邦的强制执行权限于投票权问题，而原来的法案规定强制权可以适用于一般民权，其中包括公立学校种族隔离问题等等。
