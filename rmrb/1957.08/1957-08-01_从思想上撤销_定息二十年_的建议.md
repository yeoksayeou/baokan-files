    Revoking the "Fixed Interest for Twenty Years" Proposal in Thought
    The Shanghai Xinwen Ribao (Shanghai News Daily) published an editorial on July 28 entitled "Revoking the 'Fixed Interest for Twenty Years' Proposal in Thought."
    The editorial pointed out that after criticism from the working people and progressive industrialists and businessmen in various regions, Li Kangnian had already expressed his withdrawal of the "Fixed Interest for Twenty Years" proposal on June 15. However, merely revoking it formally is insufficient. Li Kangnian and all industrialists and businessmen who supported this proposal should revoke the "Fixed Interest for Twenty Years" proposal in thought as well.
    The editorial pointed out that Li Kangnian's thinking is representative of certain industrialists and businessmen in Shanghai and other places. The "Fixed Interest for Twenty Years" proposal was a collective creation of some prominent figures in Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles. After the proposal was put forward, it immediately resonated within industrial and commercial circles. Some people believed that "this proposal connected with the masses in industrial and commercial circles and was representative, so it should be regarded as one of the 'hundred flowers' in industrial and commercial circles." Some people, after reading this proposal, composed poems to express their heartfelt appreciation. The editorial said that, of course, since the unfolding of the anti-Rightist struggle, people have rarely heard these arguments, but this kind of thinking cannot be completely eliminated all at once. In addition, there are also a very few industrialists and businessmen who not only hope to extend the period of fixed interest but also vainly attempt to take the opportunity to shake the fundamental system of socialist transformation. For these people, it will take a period of arduous struggle to truly revoke the "Fixed Interest for Twenty Years" proposal in thought.
    The editorial hopes that Li Kangnian, as well as the collective creators, supporters, and sympathizers of Li Kangnian's proposal, can combine with the deeply unfolding anti-Rightist struggle, deeply examine their thinking, correct their understanding of the redemption policy, sincerely negate this absurd proposal, resolutely take the socialist road, further transform themselves, and strive to transform themselves into self-reliant laborers.

### 从思想上撤销“定息二十年”的建议

    从思想上撤销“定息二十年”的建议
    上海新闻日报7月28日发表题为“从思想上撤销‘定息二十年’的建议”的社论。
    社论指出，李康年“定息二十年”的建议，经各地劳动人民和进步工商业者的批判，他已在6月15日表示撤销。但仅仅从形式上撤销是不够的，李康年及所有赞成这个建议的工商业者，都应从思想上撤销“定息二十年”的建议。
    社论指出，李康年的思想，在上海和各地的某些工商业者中是有代表性的。“定息二十年”的建议就是上海工商界中某些著名人士的集体创作。建议提出以后，马上在工商界中引起了共鸣。有人认为“这个建议联系了工商界的群众，有代表性，因此要把它作为工商界中百花之一”；有人看了这个建议，赋诗咏怀，表示衷心的赞赏。社论说，当然，自反右派斗争展开以后，人们很少听到这些论调了，但是这种思想不可能一下子消除干净。另外，也有极少数工商业者，不仅希望延长定息的年限，而且妄图趁机动摇社会主义改造的根本制度。对这些人来说，要做到从思想上撤销“定息二十年”的建议，更要经过一段艰苦的斗争。
    社论希望李康年以及李康年建议的集体创作者、拥护者和同情者，都能结合正在深入展开的反右派斗争，深刻地检查思想，端正对赎买政策的认识，心口如一地来否定这个荒谬的建议，坚决地走社会主义的道路，进一步改造自己，争取把自己改造成一个自食其力的劳动者。
