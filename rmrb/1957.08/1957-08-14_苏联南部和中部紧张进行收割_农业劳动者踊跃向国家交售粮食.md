The southern and central parts of the Soviet Union are intensely engaged in harvesting. Agricultural workers are enthusiastically selling grain to the state.

Moscow, August 13 (By Our Correspondent) - Harvesting is underway in the vast lands of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, which accounts for the largest share of Soviet grain production, and the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, which ranks second. This year, wheat in the newly cultivated lands of both republics is growing well, promising a bumper harvest.

The collective farms and state farms of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic are using advanced staged harvesting methods. As of August 10, they had harvested the first batch of 29 million hectares, accounting for 40% of the republic's wheat cultivation area. Workers from the Altai Krai, which plays an important role in the republic's grain production, gathered to decide to surpass last year's grain delivery task and hand over 300 million poods of grain to the state this year. To support the intense harvesting work, 15,000 Communist Youth League members and Soviet youths have come to the Altai Krai and other eastern regions of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. This year, the wheat planting area in the Novosibirsk region has increased by 180,000 hectares compared to last year. The agricultural workers of this region have decided to complete the harvesting task before September 25 and hand over 100 million poods of grain to the state above the plan.

The entire Soviet people are paying attention to this year's harvesting work in the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic. The agricultural workers of this republic have decided to strive to complete the harvesting of 21 million hectares of land in a shorter time and strive to overfulfill the state's grain purchase plan. The Akmolinsk Oblast of this republic has decided to hand over 3 million poods of grain this year, an increase of 1.05 million poods compared to last year. Currently, the harvesting work in the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic is proceeding intensely. Eighty-five thousand combine harvesters are working day and night on the vast cultivated land. Fifteen thousand Soviet youths who came from Moscow, Leningrad, and Ukraine to help with the harvest have entered the harvesting positions.

By Our Correspondent Southern Soviet Union is intensely carrying out harvesting work. The well-known grain-producing areas of Kuban (Krasnodar Krai) and Rostov Oblast have completed the state's grain requisition and purchase plans ahead of schedule. The collective farms and state farms of Kuban have handed over a total of 80 million poods of grain to the state, of which 78.5 million poods are wheat. Rostov Oblast has handed over 51.7 million poods of grain to the state, of which 48.4 million poods are wheat. In this year's harvesting work, both regions vigorously promoted the advanced staged harvesting method. In Kuban, 87% of the harvested fields were harvested using the staged harvesting method, thereby increasing the harvest volume.

In leading this year's harvesting work, the Kuban and Rostov Oblast Party organizations paid special attention to giving play to the initiative and enthusiasm of grassroots organizations.

The laborers of Kuban and Rostov Oblast, like agricultural laborers throughout the Soviet Union, responded to the call of the CPSU Central Committee: "Catch up with the United States in the production of meat, milk, and fats per capita in the next few years." In the first half of this year, they greatly increased the output of livestock products. In the first half of this year, the collective farms and state farms of Kuban handed over 20,000 tons more meat and 79,000 tons more milk to the state than in the same period last year. In the first half of this year, Rostov Oblast overfulfilled the state's requisition and purchase plan for livestock products: meat 129%, milk 133%, and eggs 124%. The amount of meat handed over to the state in the first half of the year was more than 12,000 tons more than last year, milk was more than 44,500 tons more, and eggs were more than 30 million more.

In addition, the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic also completed the state's grain requisition and purchase plan ahead of schedule. Good news of other regions completing their plans ahead of schedule is also constantly pouring in.

    苏联南部和中部紧张进行收割
    农业劳动者踊跃向国家交售粮食
    本报莫斯科13日电　占全苏粮食产量第一位的俄罗斯联邦共和国和第二位的哈萨克共和国的广阔土地上，已开始了紧张的收割工作。今年这两个共和国新垦地上的小麦都长得很好，丰收在望。
    俄罗斯联邦共和国的集体农庄和国营农场，利用先进分段收割法进行收割，到8月10日为止，已第一批收割了二千九百万公顷，即占共和国小麦耕地面积的40％。在共和国产粮方面占重要地位的阿尔泰边疆区的集体农庄和国营农场工作者们集会决定，要超过去年上交粮食的任务，今年要交给国家三亿普特粮食。为了支援紧张的收割工作，已有一万五千名共青团员和苏联青年先后来到了阿尔泰边疆区和俄罗斯联邦共和国东部其他地区。新西伯利亚地区今年小麦的播种面积比去年增加了十八万公顷。这个地区的农业劳动者决定9月25日以前完成收割任务，超计划上交给国家一亿普特粮食。
    全苏人民都注意着今年哈萨克共和国的收割工作。这个共和国的农业劳动者决定争取在较短时间内完成二千一百万公顷土地上的收割任务，争取超额完成国家粮食采购计划。这个共和国的阿克木林斯克区决定今年要上交三百万普特粮食，即比去年增加一百零五万普特粮食。目前，哈萨克共和国的收割工作正在紧张地进行着。八万五千架联合收割机日夜不停地工作在广阔的耕地上。从莫斯科、列宁格勒、乌克兰前来帮助收割的一万五千名苏联青年已进入收割阵地。
    本报讯　苏联南部正在紧张地进行收割工作。著名的产粮区库班（克拉斯诺达尔边区）和罗斯托夫州已提前完成了国家的粮食征购和采购计划。库班的集体农庄和国营农场共交给了国家八千万普特谷物，其中七千八百五十万普特是小麦。罗斯托夫州交给了国家五千一百七十万普特谷物，其中四千八百四十万普特是小麦。在今年的收割工作中，两地都大力推广了先进的分段收割法。在库班，收割的田地中有87％是采用分段收割法收割的，从而增加了收获量。
    库班和罗斯托夫州党组织在今年的收割工作的领导中，特别注意发挥基层组织的积极性和主动性。
    库班和罗斯托夫州的劳动者，同全苏各地农业劳动者一样，响应苏共中央提出的：“在最近几年内在肉类、牛奶和油脂的生产上按人口平均计算赶上美国”的号召，今年上半年都大大提高了畜产品的产量。库班的集体农庄和国营农场今年上半年交给国家的肉类，比去年同期增加了二万吨，牛奶增加了七万九千吨。罗斯托夫州今年上半年超额完成了国家畜产品方面的征购和采购计划的情况是：肉类129％，牛奶133％，鸡蛋124％。上半年交给国家的肉类比去年多一万二千多吨，牛奶多四万四千五百吨，鸡蛋多三千万个。
    此外，车臣、印古希自治共和国也提前完成了国家粮食的征购和采购计划。其他各地提前完成计划的捷报也正在不断传出。
