　　Brief News Items

　　The theatre, which can hold more than three thousand people, was packed with spectators. Many people who could not buy tickets crowded at the entrance of the theatre, hoping to catch a glimpse of the Soviet masters of art.

　　Czechoslovak Glass Fiber Production Increases Sharply
　　Prague News: Czechoslovakia's glass fiber production this year is eighty times that of 1948, and the production of artistic pottery has also increased by 40%. Czechoslovakia's glass and pottery industries have a long history. The city of Novi Bor, famous for making artistic glassware, has been in existence for two hundred years as of August this year.

　　Czechoslovak Population Reaches Over Thirteen Million
　　Prague News: According to materials from the Czechoslovak State Statistical Office, as of July 1st this year, the total population of Czechoslovakia was 13,353,104 people.

　　Spanish Prices Soar, People Live in Poverty
　　The Spanish Franco dictatorship uses the methods of raising prices and increasing taxes to maintain its huge repressive apparatus. At the beginning of August, wine prices across Spain doubled, and many other items also rose in price at the same time. The people's economic burden has therefore become even heavier.
　　Due to the Franco regime's implementation of land policies that serve the interests of large landowners and monopoly capitalists, farmers bear excessive burdens, pay too many taxes, receive low wages, and live in poverty, causing widespread bankruptcy in rural areas and an outflow of the rural population. The scale of emigration is large, resulting in a shortage of agricultural labor.

    西班牙佛朗哥独裁政权用提高物价、增加税收的办法来维持庞大的镇压机构。8月初，西班牙全国酒价提高了一倍，其他许多物品也同时涨价。人民的经济负担因此更加沉重了。
