　　The total revenue of the U.S. national budget relies entirely on taxes. The amount of taxes paid by the American people accounts for about one-third of their salaries or wages. However, many large companies and enterprises that have gained huge profits enjoy tax-free privileges.

　　U.S. Senator Kefauver recently pointed out that the "Arabian-American Oil Company" in the United States had a net income of $272,221,000 in 1955, but did not pay a single cent in taxes.

　　Recently, most states in the United States have implemented a consumption tax. This tax does not take into account the ability to pay taxes, and the tax rate is the same. Its collection principle is that as long as you spend, you have to pay taxes, regardless of your income. Therefore, this tax has the greatest impact on people with low incomes, those who live on meager pensions or relief funds, etc. Almost all of these people's income has to be taxed, because they almost have to spend all their income to cope with family needs. For example, with the same 5% consumption tax, it will account for 2.5% of the income of families with an income of $3,000 to $4,000, but only 1.9% of the income of families with an income of more than $10,000.

### 征税重贫轻富

    征税重贫轻富
    美国国家预算总收入，完全依靠税收。美国人民缴纳的捐税数额已经占到薪金或工资的约三分之一。但是，许多获得了巨额利润的大公司、大企业却享受了免税的特权。
    美国参议员克弗维尔最近指出，美国的“阿拉伯—美国石油公司”1955年的净收入是二亿七千二百二十一万美元，却连一文税也不纳。
    最近，美国绝大多数州里实行了一种消费税。这种税不问纳税能力如何，税率是一样的。它的征收原则是只要你花费就得纳税，而不论你的收入多少。因此，这种税对收入少的人，靠些微养老金或救济金过日子的人等等影响最大。这些人的收入差不多全都要被抽税，因为他们差不多必须花掉全部收入来应付家庭的需要。例如，同是征收5％的消费税，它将占收入为三、四千美元的家庭的收入的2.5％，而只占收入为一万美元以上的家庭的收入的1.9％。
