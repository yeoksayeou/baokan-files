Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 20th - In southern Shandan County, Gansu Province, at the foot of the Qilian Mountains, lies a barren basin surrounded by high mountains. In a few years, this basin will become one of the largest grain mechanized farms in the country.

　　Three tractor teams are currently reclaiming wasteland here day and night. During the day, tractors in groups of three or five shuttle back and forth, their roars echoing between heaven and earth. Large groups of startled gazelles scatter everywhere. At night, you can still see the lights of the tractors reflecting off each other.

　　This year is the first year of large-scale reclamation of wasteland on this farm, with a planned reclamation of 100,000 mu. In the next five years, this amount will be reclaimed each year. That is to say, by the end of the Second Five-Year Plan, the cultivated area of this farm will exceed the current largest Friendship Farm in our country, reaching 500,000 to 600,000 mu.

　　The area of this basin is nearly two million mu, and the soil is very fertile. Over thousands of years, the plants growing on the ground have decayed, depositing a layer of organic soil one or two feet thick, which is black in color. Tractor drivers joke, "If we transport the soil from here, it would be a very good fertilizer."

　　沉睡的土地苏醒了
　  祁连山下一个荒芜的盆地
　  将成为大型谷物机械农场
    新华社兰州20日电　甘肃省祁连山下的山丹县南部，有一块高山环抱中的荒芜的盆地。几年以后，这块盆地上将成为全国最大的谷物机械农场之一。
    三个拖拉机队目前正在这里日夜不停地开垦荒地。白天，拖拉机三五成群，往返驰骋，吼声在天地间回旋。大群受惊的黄羊到处乱窜。入夜，还可以看见拖拉机灯光交相辉映。
    今年是这个农场大规模开垦荒地的第一年，计划开荒十万亩。在今后五年内，每年都要开这么多。这就是说，到第二个五年计划末尾，这个农场的耕地面积将超过目前我国最大的友谊农场，达到五、六十万亩。
    这块盆地的面积将近两百万亩，土壤十分肥沃。几千年来地面生长的植物腐朽以后，沉积起一层一两尺厚的有机质土壤，颜色发黑。拖拉机手们说笑话：“如果把这里的土壤运出去，就是很好的肥料。”
