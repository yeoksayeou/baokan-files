	The Villa Life of Workers' Children
	As the anti-Rightist struggle deepens, the reporter visited the workers' children's villa in the summer resort of Beidaihe seaside sanatorium area. In the villa lived more than two hundred children from the kindergartens of four cotton textile factories and one printing and dyeing factory under the Tianjin Textile Bureau.
	As soon as I entered the villa's gate, I was surrounded by many tanned children in the yard full of pines and cypresses. Before long, almost every child brought his or her own small stool and invited the guest to sit down, expressing their welcome.
	A conversation with the kindergarten director helped me understand the development of these five factory kindergartens in the past few years (the number of children in the kindergartens alone has increased from dozens or hundreds to one thousand and several hundred); the achievements in running the kindergartens thriftily, and the children's frugal and happy villa life.
	What the children are most interested in about villa life is dealing with the sea water and the beach. The director was narrating small stories about how the children love the sea and the beach when a child interjected:
	"Teacher, we also use poems to praise the sea!"
	"Yes, then who would like to recite a poem for Uncle?" After the director's question received a satisfactory response, it was decided that Song Guang would choose the title of the poem himself and recite it.
	Song Guang understood the feelings of his companions. He knew that everyone wanted to perform a poem recitation. Recitation seemed to have become a right, and in order for Song Guang to share this right with other children, he suggested that the teacher appoint four more people to recite "I Saw the Ocean of the Motherland" with him in sections. Thus, the names of Zhang Bao, Zhu Quande, Zhao Yanli, and Zhang Xia were put forward by the teacher, and everyone looked at these children with envious eyes.
	When Song Guang recited the first paragraph, everyone listened quietly. When Zhang Bao recited the second paragraph, the children couldn't hold back. Everyone accompanied the recitation in a soft tone.
	The children recited so well, articulating clearly and with such emotion, each with a sparkle of joy and happiness in their eyes.
	As soon as the recitation was over, several teachers came out of the house with a large pile of small white cloth hats, leading many children.
	"It's time to go swimming in the sea!" the director said to the children, looking at his watch.
	The children lined up and walked out of the gate, jumping and bouncing, many children also waving their little hands to us.
	"Today's children are so happy!" the director said to herself.
	Yes, today's children are happy.
	In many letters from the children's parents that the director brought out, the workers made a clear contrast between their pre-liberation living conditions of struggling on the brink of unemployment, hunger and death, and their post-liberation path to a happy life. They used facts to refute the rightists' lie of "the present is not as good as the past." The workers expressed their sincere gratitude to the Party for the happy life it gave to the working people.
	The night before leaving Beidaihe, after saying goodbye to the children, I walked slowly along the beach alone. The sanatorium area is forested with trees, resembling a band of olive-green velvet in the evening sun, and countless red, silver-gray and coffee-colored sanatorium buildings are dotted like gems inlaid on the velvet band. This beautiful scenery used to be occupied by imperialists, bureaucrats, and capitalists. After liberation, the working people and their children became the masters here.
	Seeing the sea and the children's villas, the voices of the children praising the ocean of the motherland floated into my mind:
	The azure sky,
	The emerald green ocean,
	Waves following one after another,
	Crashing on the rocks,
	It seems to have put on a snow-white dress,
	Dancing and singing,
	Listen! Its rustling sound,
	How majestic!
	We also dance,
	We also sing,
	We have seen the ocean of the motherland. ...
	The azure sky,
	The emerald green ocean,
	The sun shines on the horizon,
	The breeze flutters on the sea,
	We come to the seashore of the motherland,
	Our feet stepping on the rocks,
	The rocks greet the waves,
	We thank the ocean,
	We thank the sunshine,
	You help us to become stronger,
	When we grow up,
	We must protect you,
	The ocean of the motherland!
	How the children love the ocean, love life, and love the motherland.
	It's late, time to go back to the hotel. I wanted to say goodbye to the children again, but when I walked to the gate of the villa, I could no longer hear the laughter inside. The villa was quietly silent. After a day's activities, especially after absorbing the salty air from the sea, it is necessary to have a good rest. I won't disturb you, happy children. Goodbye!

### 工人孩子的别墅生活

    工人孩子的别墅生活
    正当反右派斗争深入开展的时候，记者到避暑胜地北戴河海滨疗养区访问了工人孩子的别墅。别墅里，住着天津市纺织管理局的四个棉纺织厂、一个印染厂职工幼儿园的二百多个孩子。
    一走进别墅的栅门，在长满松柏的院子里，就被许多晒得黝黑的孩子包围了。不一会，几乎是每个孩子都拿来了自己的小板凳，请客人坐下，表示欢迎。
    幼儿园主任的谈话，使我了解到：解放几年来，这五个工厂幼儿园的发展情况（仅在园儿童数就由几十、几百增加到一千几百名了）；勤俭办园的成绩和孩子们俭朴、愉快的别墅生活。
    孩子们对别墅生活，最感兴趣的是同海水和沙滩打交道。主任正在叙述孩子们爱海、爱沙滩的小故事，有孩子插嘴说：
    “老师，我们还用诗来歌颂大海哩。”
    “对，那么你们谁愿意为叔叔朗诵一首诗歌呢？”主任的问题得到满意的答复以后，决定由宋光自己选择诗题朗诵。
    宋光懂得同伙的心情。他知道大家都想表演一下诗歌朗诵。朗诵，似乎成为一种权利，宋光为了让其他小朋友分享这种权利。便建议老师再指定四个人，和他一块分段朗诵“我见到了祖国的海洋”。于是张宝、朱全德、赵燕丽和张夏的名字，被老师提出来了，大家用羡慕的眼光看着这几个孩子。
    宋光朗诵第一段的时候，大家还是静静地听着，到张宝朗诵第二段的时候，孩子们都憋不住了，大家用轻轻的声调伴随着朗诵。
    孩子们朗诵得真好，吐字清楚，又那么富有感情，一个个眼睛里闪烁着愉快和幸福的光辉。
    朗诵刚完，几位老师抱着一大堆白色小布帽，带领着许多小朋友从屋里走出来了。
    “时候到了，该下海游泳去啦！”主任看了看手表对孩子们说。
    孩子们排成队，跳跳蹦蹦地向栅门外走去，许多孩子还向我们挥着小手。
    “今天的孩子真幸福啊！”主任自言自语。
    是的，今天的孩子是幸福的。
    在主任拿出来的许多孩子家长的来信中，工人把自己解放前在失业、饥饿和死亡线上挣扎的生活处境，与解放后走向幸福的生活情况，作了鲜明的对照。他们用事实反击了右派分子“今不如昔”的谎言。工人们对党给予劳动人民的幸福生活，表示了真诚的感激。
    离开北戴河的头一天晚上，向孩子们道别以后，独自慢步在海滨。疗养区树木成林，在夕阳光下形似一条橄榄绿色的丝绒带子，数不清的红色的、银灰色和咖啡色的疗养所建筑，点缀得如同一粒粒镶在丝绒带子上的宝石。这一片美好的景色，从前是被帝国主义者、官僚、资本家霸占的，解放以后，劳动人民和他们的子女成了这里的主人。
    看到海和孩子们的别墅，脑海里浮起了小朋友们歌颂祖国海洋的声音：
    蔚蓝的天空，
    碧绿的海洋，
    波浪一个跟着一个，
    撞在岩石上，
    它好像换上了雪白的衣裳，
    跳舞又歌唱，
    听！它哗啦哗啦的声响，
    多么雄壮！
    我们也跳舞，
    我们也歌唱，
    我们见到了祖国的海洋。…………
    蔚蓝的天空，
    碧绿的海洋，
    太阳在天边照耀，
    微风在海上飘扬，
    我们来到祖国的海边，
    两脚踏上岩石，
    岩石迎着波浪，
    我们谢谢海洋，
    我们谢谢阳光，
    你帮助我们锻炼得更坚强，
    我们长大了，
    一定要保卫着你，
    祖国的海洋！
    孩子们是多么热爱海洋、热爱生活、热爱祖国。
    晚了，该回旅寓了。原想再一次去向孩子们告别，但走到别墅栅门口时，已经听不见里面的嘻笑声，别墅，是静悄悄的一片，孩子们都睡了。一天的活动，尤其是在海滨吸足了海上的咸空气之后，更需要很好的休息。不惊动你们了，幸福的孩子。再见！（附图片）
