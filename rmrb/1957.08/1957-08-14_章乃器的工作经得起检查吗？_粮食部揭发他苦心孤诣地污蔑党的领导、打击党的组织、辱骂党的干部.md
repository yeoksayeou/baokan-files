Xinhua News Agency, August 13th: Does Zhang Naiqi really love the Communist Party "as he loves his own eyes," as he claims? The Ministry of Food's continued mass criticism meeting against Zhang Naiqi today thoroughly exposed his lies.

Shi Min, Assistant Minister of the Ministry of Food, spoke first today. He listed numerous facts to prove that Zhang Naiqi has consistently shown no regard for the Party's leadership, attacked Party cadres, and undermined the Party's prestige. Shi Min said: In the past few years, Zhang Naiqi, in his work at the Ministry of Food, has frequently disobeyed the decisions of higher authorities on some major issues. For example, in the first half of 1954, many places promoted rice bran oil extraction in order to expand oil sources. However, whether the use of bran cake as feed would affect the nutritional value for pigs after the implementation of rice bran oil extraction was still under research at the time. Therefore, the Central Finance and Economics Committee (CFEC) instructed all localities to temporarily suspend promotion. At the time, Deng Xiaoping, Deputy Director of the CFEC, also instructed Vice Minister Chen Xiyun in person to have the Ministry of Food focus on experimenting with the effect of bran cake feeding pigs for a period of time. However, Zhang Naiqi was very dissatisfied with this instruction from the CFEC and believed that Vice Minister Chen Xiyun's communication of Deputy Director Deng Xiaoping's instruction was "blindly obeying superiors," "deifying superiors," and "personal worship." For three years, Zhang Naiqi has been dissatisfied with this matter and has often deliberately distorted the facts in many occasions, making malicious attacks on the Party and higher-level leaders, and falsely accusing the CFEC's measure of stopping the promotion of rice bran oil extraction as "replacing science with administrative orders." Even on February 7th of this year, when Zhang Naiqi spoke about the "rice bran oil extraction" issue at a forum for scientists held by the Ministry of Food, his emotions were particularly激昂. He once again slandered the Party at the meeting for "replacing science with common sense" and "deciding scientific issues by show of hands," as if only he, Zhang Naiqi, understood science.

Shi Min also cited the issue of standard rice. After the CFEC decided to lower the rice yield rate, Zhang Naiqi also adopted an attitude of resistance, spreading comments against this decision everywhere. Moreover, a recent inspection of the archives revealed that Zhang Naiqi had also written a letter to Premier Zhou in April 1956, falsely reporting that "according to Director Yang Enfu of the Central Institute of Hygiene, beriberi in the South has greatly decreased recently, mainly due to the benefits of standard rice." However, after checking the materials written by Yang Enfu, he did not say this; rather, it was Zhang Naiqi's deliberate fabrication in order to prove that the higher authorities' past decisions were wrong.

Shi Min also revealed that Zhang Naiqi was dissatisfied with the CCP Party Groups in state organs. In a letter written to Premier Zhou last August, Zhang Naiqi openly stated, "Until recently, it is difficult to understand that some central and provincial and municipal governments still deploy work to lower levels in the name of the Party Group"; the letter said that this was "detrimental to giving play to the role of state organs and promoting democracy." Shi Min said, "Although Zhang Naiqi's letter was written very implicitly, isn't his intention to weaken or even abolish the leadership of Party Groups in government departments very obvious?"

Shi Min said that Zhang Naiqi usually felt that the establishment of Party Groups in the organs hindered his personal prestige and desire for power. Zhang Naiqi never indicated that he would submit issues he couldn't solve to the Party Group for discussion; he was also very dissatisfied with the Party Group's direct reporting of work to the Central Committee. Zhang Naiqi also greatly belittled the role of the Party's grassroots organizations and general Party members in the Ministry of Food. In the past four or five years, he rarely talked about the role of Party organizations and Party members in the organs, but his slanders and rumors against the Party could be heard at any time.

Shi Min then revealed that Zhang Naiqi does not give up any opportunity to oppose the Communist Party, and even in handling people's letters, he tried his best to incite opposition to the Communist Party and the government. He was particularly interested in materials that were dissatisfied with the current social system and cursed the Party and the government, and without any investigation, he unconditionally sympathized with, praised, encouraged, and supported them. For example, in February of this year, a man named Fu Shiming from the Ningbo Oil Company in Zhejiang wrote to Zhang Naiqi, fabricating that "cold-pressed tofu" was his invention, and the letter cursed the relevant leading departments of the Central Committee for having serious "bureaucracy." After reading this letter, Zhang Naiqi, in addition to cheering, wrote three big characters "骂得好! (Mà de hǎo!)" – "Well Cursed!" Later, after investigation, the facts proved that "cold-pressed tofu" was not invented by this person. Shi Min also said that in March and April of this year, Wang Lüe, a member of the Fengguang Agricultural Cooperative in Dailou Township, Shouxian County, Anhui, who came from a landlord family, wrote several letters to Zhang Naiqi, discrediting the Party's agricultural collectivization policy in various ways. Zhang Naiqi appreciated this letter very much, personally wrote a reply to Wang Lüe, and said that this letter "had great reference value for policy-making," and encouraged Wang Lüe to continue writing articles, which he could introduce to newspapers and periodicals for publication.

Shi Min said: Based on the above events, combined with his recent slanders against the Communist Party for having "great-Partyism" and other facts, isn't what Zhang Naiqi wants is to fundamentally overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party?

Wang Huawen, Deputy Director of the Capital Construction Bureau, also revealed many facts about Zhang Naiqi's opposition to the Party's leadership. He said that he had been with Zhang Naiqi for four years and had never heard Zhang Naiqi mention the leadership of the Party Group of the Ministry of Food. Zhang Naiqi also described the resolute implementation of the instructions of the Party Central Committee by the Party organization of the Ministry of Food as "weak and incompetent," viciously provoking the Party organization of the Ministry of Food to oppose the Central Committee, and provoking the relationship between lower-level organizations and the Central Committee.

Wang Huawen said that Zhang Naiqi also sought every opportunity to attack Party cadres, especially leading Party cadres. Zhang Naiqi's attitude towards the late Vice Minister of Food Chen Xiyun was quite bad, and he scolded Chen Xiyun for being "weak in reflecting opinions to higher authorities." In addition, Zhang Naiqi openly slandered at the general meeting of cadres of the Ministry of Food that "the work efficiency of the Ministry of Food is not as high as it was during the Kuomintang era," and spread rumors that the Industrial Bureau of the Ministry of Food had produced "two Berias." Wang Huawen then exposed the lie that Zhang Naiqi said that "his work in the Ministry of Food could stand inspection." He said that Zhang Naiqi had power and authority in the Ministry of Food, but he only held on to power and did not fulfill his responsibilities. The Capital Construction Bureau was under the leadership of Zhang Naiqi, but Zhang Naiqi gave up leadership and never asked about the situation and problems of capital construction work.

Ma Qing, Deputy Director of the Industrial Bureau, used his personal experience to refute Zhang Naiqi's lie of "having feelings for workers and peasants."

Ma Qing said that he himself was born as a factory apprentice and had lived a life of hardship and poverty since he was a child, but in the nearly five years at the Ministry of Food, he not only did not feel that Zhang Naiqi had any feelings for him, but was often slandered and attacked by Zhang Naiqi. Zhang Naiqi said that he was "dishonest," "of poor character," "sowing discord," "undisciplined," and even scolded him as "Beria," and asked the Personnel Department to review his history. Ma Qing also revealed that when Zhang Naiqi went to Zhejiang Province for "inspection" last year, he approached landlords, rich peasants, and controlled elements, and did not care about the workers and peasants at all. Ma Qing asked: Is this having feelings for workers and peasants?

Nie Hongjun, Vice Minister of Food, attended the meeting today despite being ill and spoke to criticize Zhang Naiqi's so-called "self-criticism" yesterday.

Nie Hongjun pointed out: Zhang Naiqi's "self-criticism" on the 13th actually continued to release three poisonous arrows.

Nie Hongjun analyzed: Zhang Naiqi's "self-criticism" yesterday actually continued to shoot three poisonous arrows at the Communist Party and socialism. The first poisonous arrow is that he said he should not publicly express opinions on international relations, class relations, and other issues in his personal capacity. This is his malicious slander that our country has no democracy, freedom, or equality, and attempts to blur people's understanding of his class face. I want to solemnly tell Zhang Naiqi: Our socialist democracy, freedom, and equality are genuine democracy, freedom, and equality. We will never allow you to sell capitalist reactionary and hypocritical democracy, freedom, and equality to our country.

The second poisonous arrow is that he said that his "attitude was a bit rude" and "offended many people." He implied that the criticism of his bourgeois rightist words and deeds was deliberately aimed at "retaliation" against him. He attempted to describe the struggle between us and him on two different roads as unprincipled retaliation.

The third poisonous arrow is that he insulted the democratic parties for having a "dark undercurrent," saying that he was very unfamiliar with the "policy-related activities" in united front work. This is to make people suspect that someone is playing tricks on him somewhere. He described those in the democratic parties who support the Communist Party and socialism as "fighting for power and profit, harming others for their own benefit, and flattering," and here we want Zhang Naiqi to state the facts, otherwise he should explain his intentions and conspiracies.

Nie Hongjun said that Zhang Naiqi's so-called "self-criticism," apart from being more insidious, more deeply anti-Communist, anti-socialist, and more vicious in releasing poisonous arrows, had not made any "improvement" compared to his "self-criticism" at the Fourth Session of the National People's Congress. He also declared, "I only seek to be beneficial to the 'revolution' and am not afraid of being a rightist." This shows that he wants to adhere to the bourgeois rightist stance. I want to shout to Zhang Naiqi: We are determined to fight him to the end.

The meeting will continue tomorrow.

### 章乃器的工作经得起检查吗？  粮食部揭发他苦心孤诣地污蔑党的领导、打击党的组织、辱骂党的干部

    章乃器的工作经得起检查吗？
    粮食部揭发他苦心孤诣地污蔑党的领导、打击党的组织、辱骂党的干部
    据新华社13日讯　章乃器对共产党真的像他所说“像爱护自己的眼珠一样”吗？粮食部今天继续举行的批判章乃器的大会，彻底戳穿了他的谎言。
    粮食部部长助理史敏今天首先发言。他列举大量事实证明章乃器一贯目无党的领导，攻击党员干部，破坏党的威信。史敏说：几年来章乃器在粮食部的工作中在一些重大问题上，经常不服从上级的决定，例如1954年上半年，许多地方为了扩大油源，曾经推广米糠榨油，但实行米糠榨油后，糠饼作饲料是否影响对猪的营养价值，当时尚须研究。因此，中财委指示各地暂时停止推广。当时中财委副主任邓小平也当面指示陈希云副部长，要粮食部在一个时期内着重试验糠饼喂猪的效果。可是章乃器对中财委这一指示很不满意，并认为陈希云副部长传达邓小平副主任的指示是“盲目服从上级”、“神化上级”，“是个人崇拜”。三年来章乃器对这件事一直心怀不满，并常常在许多场合故意歪曲事实，对党和上级领导进行恶毒的攻击，诬蔑中财委停止推广米糠榨油的措施，是以“行政命令代替科学”。一直到今年2月7日章乃器在粮食部召开的科学家座谈会上，谈到“米糠榨油”问题时，情绪表现得特别激昂。他在会上再一次地污蔑党是“以常识代替科学”，“以举手表决的办法决定科学上的问题”，似乎只有他章乃器才懂得科学。
    史敏又举出关于标准米的问题，在中财委决定降低稻谷出米率后，章乃器也是采取了抗拒的态度，到处散布反对这个决定的言论。而且最近检查档案，发现章乃器在1956年4月还向周总理写过一封信，谎报说：“据中央卫生研究院杨恩孚主任反映，近来南方脚气病已经大大减少，这主要是标准米的好处。”可是后来查对杨恩孚写的材料，他并没有这样说过，而是章乃器为了证明上级过去的决定不对，故意虚构的。
    史敏还揭露，章乃器对于国家机关中的中共党组是不满的。去年8月章乃器写给周总理一封信，公然提出，“直到近来，某些中央和省市还以党组名义对下布置工作，就难以理解了”；信上说，这对“发挥国家机关的作用和发扬民主都是不利的”。史敏说，“章乃器这封信虽然写得很隐晦，但他的用心是要削弱甚至取消政府部门中党组的领导，还不是很明显的吗？”
    史敏说，章乃器平时总感到机关设有党组，妨碍他个人的威信和权力欲望。章乃器遇有不能解决的问题，从来不表示要提请党组讨论；对党组直接向中央汇报工作也很不满。章乃器对粮食部党的基层组织和一般党员的作用也是十分轻视的，四、五年来，他很少谈到过机关党组织和党员的作用，但是他对党的污蔑造谣却随时可以听到。
    史敏接着又揭露章乃器不放弃任何一个反对共产党的机会，甚至在处理人民来信中也是竭力煽动反对共产党和政府。他对于不满现在的社会制度、骂党、骂政府的材料，特别感到兴趣，根本不经过任何调查，就无条件地同情、赞扬、鼓励和支持。如今年2月，浙江宁波油脂公司一个名叫傅时明的人给章乃器写信，捏造说“冷榨豆腐”是他发明的，那封信上谩骂中央有关领导部门有严重的“官僚主义”。章乃器看了这封信后，在喝采之余，大笔一挥批了三个大字“骂得好！”后来经过调查，事实证明“冷榨豆腐”并不是这人发明的。史敏又说，今年3、4月间安徽寿县代楼乡风光农业合作社一个地主家庭出身的分子王略给章乃器写了几封信，从各方面诋毁党的农业合作化政策，章乃器对于这封信十分欣赏，亲自给王略写了回信，还说这封信“很有施政参考价值”，并鼓励王略继续写稿，他可以介绍给报刊发表。
    史敏说：根据以上这些事件，结合最近他污蔑共产党有“大党主义”等等事实，章乃器不是想从根本上推翻共产党的领导，又是什么呢？
    基建局副局长王化文也揭露了章乃器反对党的领导的许多事实。他说，他同章乃器相处四年，从来没有听到章乃器提过粮食部党组的领导。章乃器还把粮食部党组织坚决贯彻党中央指示说成是“软弱无能”，恶毒地挑拨粮食部党组织反对中央，挑拨下级组织同中央的关系。
    王化文说，章乃器还寻一切机会打击党员干部，特别是打击党员负责干部。章乃器对已故的粮食部副部长陈希云态度相当恶劣，辱骂陈希云“向上级反映意见软弱”。此外，章乃器在粮食部全体干部大会上公然诬蔑“粮食部的工作效率不如国民党时代高”，造谣说粮食部工业局出了“两个贝利亚”。王化文接着揭穿了章乃器所说的他“在粮食部的工作经得起检查”的谎言。他说，章乃器在粮食部是有职有权的，但他只握紧了权，而没有尽到他的职责。基建局是由章乃器分工领导的，但是，章乃器放弃了领导，从来没有过问过基建工作的情况和问题。
    工业局副局长马青以他的亲身体会，驳斥了章乃器的“对工农分子有感情”的谎言。
    马青说，他自己是工厂学徒出身，从小过着劳苦贫困的日子，可是在粮食部将近五年来，不仅没有感到章乃器对他有感情，而且经常受到章乃器的诬蔑和打击。章乃器说他“不正派”，“品质恶劣”，“挑拨离间”，“无组织无纪律”，甚至骂他是“贝利亚”，要求人事司审查他的历史。马青还揭露章乃器去年到浙江省“视察”时，所接近的是地主、富农和被管制分子，对工农群众毫不关心。马青问：这是对工农分子有感情吗？
    粮食部副部长聂洪钧今天抱病到会，发言批驳了章乃器昨天的所谓“检讨”。
    聂洪钧指出：章乃器13日的“检讨”实际上是继续放出了三支毒箭
    聂洪钧分析说：章乃器昨天的“检讨”，实际上是继续向共产党、向社会主义放射了三支毒箭。第一支毒箭是，他说他不该以个人的身份在国际关系、阶级关系和其他问题上公开发表意见，这是他恶毒地诬蔑我国没有民主、自由、平等，企图模糊人们对他阶级面貌的认识。我要正告章乃器：我国社会主义的民主、自由、平等，是真正的民主、自由、平等，你企图把资本主义反动的、虚伪的民主、自由、平等贩卖到我国，我们决不答应。
    第二支毒箭是，他说他“态度有些粗暴”“得罪了不少人”，他暗示大家对他的资产阶级右派言行的批判，都是有意对他的“打击报复”。他企图把我们和他之间的两条道路的斗争，说成是无原则的打击报复。
    第三支毒箭是，他辱骂民主党派里有股“暗流”，说他对统战工作中的“政策性活动”很隔膜。这就是叫人怀疑有人在什么地方捣他的鬼。他把民主党派拥护共产党与社会主义的人说成是“争权夺利、损人利己、吹牛拍马”，这里我们要章乃器讲出事实，否则就应交代自己的居心和阴谋。
    聂洪钧说，章乃器的所谓“检讨”，除了更加阴险，更加刻骨地反共、反社会主义，更加恶毒的放毒箭以外，比他在全国人民代表大会第四次会议上的“检讨”，一点也没有什么“提高”。他并且声言，“只求对‘革命’有利，不怕当右派”。这说明他要坚持资产阶级右派立场。我要向章乃器大吼一声，我们有决心同他斗争到底。
    会议还将在明天继续举行。
