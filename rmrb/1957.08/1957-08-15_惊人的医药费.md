American Underworld

    An article in the July issue of "U.S. News & World Report" stated that "the high cost of medical care has become an increasing concern for many American families." For some families, a serious illness can be a "major disaster."
    For example, a five-year-old boy, the son of a truck driver in Manhasset, New York, was rescued from a deep well. The doctors who treated him sent the child's parents, who earn $5,460 a year, a medical bill for $1,500.
    According to official statistics, hospital costs are now three times higher than in 1936. For example, it now costs $8,603 to hospitalize a patient with a heart infection for 116 days. (The average annual wage of an industrial worker in the United States is now about $4,000.)

    惊人的医药费
    7月间一期“美国新闻与世界报道”上的一篇文章说，“医药费用昂贵已成为美国许多家庭越来越忧虑的问题。”对有些家庭说来，一次大病可能成为一场“大灾难”。
    例如，纽约曼诺维尔城一个卡车司机的五岁男孩被人从深井中救起，后来救护他的医生给这个小孩的年薪五千四百六十元的父母送来一个医药费账单：一千五百美元。
    根据官方统计，现在住院费比1936年增加了三倍。比如现在心脏感染病人住院一百一十六天，要用去八千六百零三美元。（现在美国一个产业工人的平均年工资大约是四千美元。）
