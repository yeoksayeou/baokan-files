    Necessary "Trouble"
    In the past, the method of distributing rations in most rural areas was "rationing by mouth" – giving the same amount of rations to everyone, regardless of age or strength. This meant that households with more able-bodied adults and laborers felt it was not enough to eat; households with more children and fewer laborers not only had enough to eat, but also had a surplus. A cooperative's grain should have been sufficient to feed everyone after completing the state purchase quota, but with this method of distribution, many households did not have enough to eat and had to ask the state for more supplies.
    Some farmers in some areas call this phenomenon "enough or not, three hundred and sixty" [meaning roughly the same, every day]. This is a sharp criticism of our work – criticizing unfair practices and a lack of responsibility towards the masses.
    Why do many places do this? It may be that everyone feels that "rationing by mouth" involves less "trouble" in the work. However, doing so is bound to bring even greater "trouble" to future work. Besides, serving the masses and being responsible to the masses, even if it is a bit more "troublesome," isn't that exactly what we should be doing?

### 必要的“麻烦”

    必要的“麻烦”
    过去，大部分农村分配口粮的办法都是“计口授粮”——不论大口小口，都给一样多的口粮。这样，越是青壮年多、劳动力多的户，越觉得不够吃；孩子多、劳动力少的户，不但够吃，而且有余。一个社的粮食在完成国家征购任务以后，本来应该够吃的，这样一分，也就有许多户不够吃了，不得不要求国家多供应。
    有些地方的农民把这种现象叫做“够不够，三百六”。这是对于我们的工作的一个尖锐的批评——批评做事不公平，批评对群众不负责任。
    为什么很多地方都这样做呢？可能是大家觉得“计口授粮”在工作中可以少“麻烦”。可是，这样做，势必会给以后的工作带来更大的“麻烦”。再说，为群众服务，对群众负责，即使“麻烦”一些，不也是完全应该做的吗？
