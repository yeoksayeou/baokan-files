Xinhua News Agency, August 23rd dispatch: According to TASS reports, the Soviet Union's national republics, which were very backward in production before the revolution, have now developed into industrially advanced countries. The level of industrial development in many republics has surpassed many formerly advanced capitalist countries.

	Before 1917, the Belorussian Republic had no automobile industry. However, the trucks it now produces exceed the total truck production of Austria, Denmark, and Ireland combined. Its output of metal-cutting machine tools per capita is approximately three times that of France.

	The total industrial output of the Armenian Republic has now increased more than forty-five times compared to 1913. In 1913, it produced only twenty-six types of industrial products, but by 1956, this had increased to more than four hundred. The electricity it now produces in twelve hours is equal to its entire electricity production in 1913. Its electricity production level per capita now exceeds Italy by 76%, Japan by 80%, and is twenty-one times that of its neighbor, Turkey.

	The Tajik Republic in Central Asia can now produce its entire industrial output of 1928 in two and a half days. In the last two years alone, more than twenty new industrial enterprises have been built in the republic. Before the October Revolution, the Turkmen Republic had a total of eleven small cotton ginning factories and six oil and soap factories. Now, it has more than six hundred industrial and transportation enterprises. In the years since the Patriotic War alone, it has built one hundred and eighty new enterprises. Its machinery, equipment, and other industrial products are sold to many other countries.

	The Ukrainian Republic was a relatively industrially developed region of Russia before the revolution. During the Soviet era, its industry has developed even faster. Its pig iron production is now greater than the total pig iron production of the United Kingdom, Italy, Sweden, and Spain combined. Its steel production is almost equal to the steel production of France, Sweden, and Austria combined. (Attached picture)

    苏联各民族共和国工业发展快马加鞭
    许多共和国工业水平超过资本主义国家
    新华社23日讯　据塔斯社报道：革命以前生产非常落后的苏联各民族共和国现在已经发展成为工业发达的国家，许多共和国的工业发展水平已经超过了不少曾经是先进的资本主义国家。
    1917年以前，白俄罗斯共和国是没有汽车工业的。然而，它现在生产的载重汽车已经超过了奥地利、丹麦和爱尔兰三国生产载重汽车的总和。按人口平均计算，它的金属切削机床的产量约等于法国的三倍。
    亚美尼亚共和国的工业总产量现在已经增加为1913年的四十五倍以上。1913年，它生产的工业产品只有二十六种，1956年已经增加到四百多种。它现在每十二小时生产的电力，已经等于1913年全年的电力产量。按人口平均计算，它的电力生产水平现在超过意大利76％，超过日本80％，等于同它接壤的土耳其的二十一倍。
    中亚细亚的塔吉克共和国现在用两天半的时间就可以生产出它在1928年全年所出产的工业产品，单在最近两年间，共和国新建的工业企业就有二十多个。十月革命以前，土库曼共和国共有十一个不大的净棉工厂、六个油脂和肥皂工厂。而现在，它已经拥有六百多个工业和运输企业；单是在卫国战争以后的年代中，它就建成了一百八十个新企业。它出产的机器、设备和其他工业产品远销许多其他国家。
    乌克兰共和国是革命以前俄国工业比较发达的地区。在苏维埃政权年代中，它的工业又获得了更快的发展。它的生铁产量现在比英国、意大利、瑞典、西班牙四国生铁产量的总和还多，钢产量差不多等于法国、瑞典和奥地利的钢产量的总和。（附图片）
