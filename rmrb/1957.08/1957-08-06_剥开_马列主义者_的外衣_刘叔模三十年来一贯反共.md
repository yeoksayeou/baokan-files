Stripping off the "Marxist-Leninist" Cloak
Liu Shumo Has Been Consistently Anti-Communist for Thirty Years
(Xinhua News Agency Dispatch) Liu Shumo, Deputy Chairman and Secretary-General of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee, had his ugly anti-Soviet and anti-Communist features thoroughly exposed at a branch meeting of the Wuhan Municipal People's Committee Counselor's Office of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee on the 2nd.

Liu Shumo openly defended right-wing elements; he said that Ge Peiqi's speech was only because he had suffered some grievances in the Su Fan movement and was "emotional." He regarded Zhang Bojun as a politician without a central idea, and believed that it was only natural for him to propose a "political design institute."

According to people's exposure, Liu Shumo has consistently hated the Communist Party and opposed socialism. Liu Shumo arrogantly described himself as a "Marxist-Leninist in Wuhan" and a "gentleman," while describing activists who were close to the Party as villains who would do anything.

At the meeting, participants used many facts to strip off the last piece of clothing that Liu Shumo used to disguise himself as a "Marxist-Leninist." It turned out that this anti-communist expert had already slandered Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Nie Rongzhen, who were revolutionaries studying in France at the time, during his study in France from 1919 to 1922. According to revelations by Dai Wen and other counselors of the Counselor's Office, he colluded with Wang Jingwei around the time of the Great Revolution; after the start of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he climbed to the high position of a member of the puppet provincial government, singing anti-Soviet and anti-Communist tunes, and published many reactionary articles in the "Hubei Forum" he founded, cursing the Communist Party as "an inherent obstacle to the slow development of Chinese society, and it will never be allowed to show its ferocity again." Until the eve of liberation, he also advocated moving the puppet provincial government to the western Hubei mountainous area, resolutely opposing communism to the end.

In the face of a large number of facts, Liu Shumo still tried to quibble, attributing all his reactionary words and deeds to "bourgeois individualism."

### 剥开“马列主义者”的外衣  刘叔模三十年来一贯反共

    剥开“马列主义者”的外衣
    刘叔模三十年来一贯反共
    本报讯　民革武汉市委副主委兼秘书长刘叔模反苏反共的丑恶面目，2日在民革武汉市人民委员会参事室支部会上被彻底揭露出来。
    刘叔模曾公开为右派分子辩护；他说葛佩琦的发言只是因为他在肃反运动中受了些委屈，是“感情用事”。他把章伯钧看成是一个没有中心思想的政治家，认为他提出“政治设计院”是很自然的事。
    根据人们的揭发，刘叔模一贯仇视共产党，反对社会主义。刘叔模狂妄地把自己说成是“武汉的马列主义者”，是“正人君子”，而把靠近党的积极分子说成是无所不作的小人。
    在会议上，与会者以许多事实剥开了刘叔模伪装“马列主义者”的最后一件外衣。原来，这个反共专家远在1919年到1922年留学法国期间，就谩骂过当时留法革命者周恩来总理和聂荣臻副总理。据参事室参事戴文等揭露，大革命前后，他勾结汪精卫；抗日战争开始后，他又爬上了伪省府委员的高位，大唱反苏反共滥调，在他创办的“湖北论坛”上发表了许多反动文章，诅咒共产党是“中国社会发展迟滞的内在阻力，决不允许它再张凶焰”。直到解放前夕，他还主张把伪省府迁往鄂西山区，坚决反共到底。
    在大量事实面前，刘叔模仍企图狡辩，把一切反动言行归结为出于“资产阶级的个人主义”。
