Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, August 15th: Fishermen on the Taishan Islands in Fujian Province recently presented a silk banner with the four characters "Serving the Country and the People" to a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's coastal defense forces stationed on the Fujian front, thanking the officers and soldiers for rescuing forty-six fishermen in the face of raging waves.

On the morning of July 28th, a typhoon of force eight was raging over the northeastern Fujian sea. A fishing boat was overturned by the waves, and four fishermen fell into the water. Four fishing boats that went to rescue them were also blown out to sea by the wind and waves before reaching the site of the accident. Upon hearing the news, the coastal defense troops immediately organized officers and soldiers to drive a landing craft to the rescue. They rescued the four fishermen who had fallen into the water and towed the four fishing boats carrying forty-two fishermen back to port. At this time, due to the excessive wind and waves and overloading, the engine on the craft suddenly broke down, and the landing craft and fishing boats were blown to the sea off the Pingyang area of Zhejiang Province. The officers and soldiers comforted the fishermen while speeding up the repair of the engine. It was not until August 1st that they returned safely from the sea.

    在风浪中奋勇抢救渔民
    新华社福建前线15日电  福建省台山列岛上的渔民，最近献给福建前线中国人民解放军海防部队某部一面写有“为国为民”四个大字的锦旗，感谢官兵们在惊涛骇浪中抢救了四十六个渔民。
    7月28日早晨，闽东北海面上刮着八级台风，一只渔船被海浪冲翻，四个渔民落水。前去营救的四只渔船未到遇难地点，也被风浪冲击得向外海飘去。海防部队闻讯后，立即组织了官兵驾着一条登陆艇赶往抢救。他们救起了四名落水的渔民，并且拖着载有四十二名渔民的四条渔船返航。这时，由于风浪太大和超载，艇上机器突然发生了故障，登陆艇和渔船被风吹到浙江省平阳地区海面。官兵们一边安慰渔民，一边加紧修理机器，直到8月1日，才从海上安全归来。
