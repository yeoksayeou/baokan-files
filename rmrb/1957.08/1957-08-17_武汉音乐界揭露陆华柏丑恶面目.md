Wuhan music circles are refuting the anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds of Lu Huabai, the director of the Music Department of Wuhan Art Normal College and the deputy director of the Wuhan Branch of the Chinese Musicians Association. It is revealed that he believes that senior intellectuals suffered about the same amount of oppression in the old and new societies; it was just a change from Kuomintang masters to Communist Party masters. He encouraged students to "ignore everything and just sit in the piano room and play," and to "turn a blind eye." He took a completely negative attitude towards the works of Nie Er and Xian Xinghai, saying that Xian Xinghai's First Symphony was inexplicable. Before liberation, when Lu Huabai worked at the Hunan Conservatory of Music, he wore a ragged cotton-padded coat and didn't even change his pants. Now he lives in a Western-style house, eats well, wears well, and enjoys the treatment of a level-three professor, but he has taken a completely ungrateful attitude towards the Party and the government, and has launched a large-scale attack on the Party during the rectification campaign.

    武汉音乐界揭露陆华柏丑恶面目
    本报讯  武汉艺术师范学院音乐系主任、中国音乐家协会武汉分会副主任陆华柏的反党反社会主义言行正受到武汉音乐界人士的驳斥。据揭露：他认为高级知识分子在新旧社会受到的压抑差不多，是国民党老爷换了共产党老爷。他鼓励学生“不管一切，只管坐在钢琴房里弹就是了”，要“睁一只眼闭一只眼”。他对聂耳冼星海作品采取全然否定的态度，说冼星海的第一交响乐莫名其妙。陆华柏解放前在湖南音专工作时，穿的破棉袄，裤子也没有换的，现在住的洋房，吃好的，穿好的，享受三级教授的待遇，但他却对党和政府完全采取忘恩负义的态度，在整风中对党大肆攻击。
