We Must Overcome Narrow Nationalism

The Harm of Narrow Nationalism

Nationalism, in oppressed and plundered weak countries, when they resist imperialist aggression to fight for national independence and liberation, is revolutionary and progressive. This is like the situation of our country in the long-term anti-imperialist struggle in the past and the current situation of some Asian and African countries striving for national independence. Beyond this scope, nationalism loses its progressiveness and becomes reactionary. Because nationalism belongs to the bourgeois ideological system. Since the emergence of the bourgeoisie in history, it has understood how to use nationalism to provoke ethnic disputes among the working people of different nationalities to consolidate its rule. In the era of imperialism, the bourgeoisie knows even better how to use deceptive nationalist slogans to drive the masses to participate in wars of aggression and carry out national plunder. In socialist countries, proletarian internationalism is used to counter bourgeois nationalism, and the demand for national self-determination is used to counter bourgeois national oppression policies. In our country, national autonomy is implemented. Our doing so is beneficial to anti-imperialism. As something in the bourgeois ideological system, we are against nationalism. The "Concise Dictionary of Philosophy" states: "The Communist Party is fighting against the remnants of capitalism in people's consciousness, including various manifestations of bourgeois nationalism. The remnants of capitalism in people's consciousness are more vital in the field of national issues than in any other field." China is still a very young socialist country. In our country, the private ownership of the means of production in the economy has been basically eliminated, but the question of who will win between socialism and capitalism on the political and ideological fronts has not been truly resolved. Bourgeois ideology still exists in large quantities, and bourgeois ideology is even more prevalent in the field of national issues. All nationalisms are narrow-minded, and their manifestations are various. When it is manifested in the relationship between fraternal ethnic groups within the country, our majority ethnic group manifests as Han chauvinism, and the minority ethnic groups manifest as local nationalism. This is, of course, harmful to the friendly unity of all ethnic groups in the country. When it is manifested in international relations, major countries manifest as great nationalism (or great-power chauvinism), and show narrow nationalism towards brotherly countries. This is, of course, harmful to the friendly unity between countries. Therefore, narrow nationalism is a harmful thing belonging to the bourgeois ideological system and must be overcome.

Narrow nationalism is particularly harmful and profound for intellectuals. Because nationalism has a progressive and even revolutionary side in the anti-imperialist struggle of oppressed and invaded colonial and semi-colonial national countries, narrow nationalism often appears wearing the cloak of "patriotism." Patriotism combined with proletarian internationalism is the real revolutionary patriotism; otherwise, it is essentially bourgeois nationalism, which is reactionary. Most intellectuals are patriotic and like to flaunt patriotism; however, if they do not distinguish patriotism from narrow nationalism, they will inadvertently or intentionally engage in reactionary acts in the name of patriotism. Revolutionary and revolutionary-aspiring intellectuals must stand firmly on the proletarian stand, receive education and training in proletarian internationalism, and then gradually overcome narrow nationalism and reach the realm of combining internationalism and patriotism.

          “A Short Trip to Lushun” is an example

In the study during the rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle, I discovered that I have remnants of narrow nationalist thinking.

A concrete example is an article I wrote called "A Short Trip to Lushun," published in the August issue of "Traveler" magazine last year, which contained errors of narrow nationalism. The article described the large tank displayed in front of the Lushun Military Museum, clearly writing: "This large tank once participated in the Battle of Stalingrad and the Battle of Berlin, and then turned around and came to Lushun. The new history of Lushun began here." This is correct, but the next paragraph immediately follows with: "The past history of Lushun is tragic. In the Sino-Japanese War of 1894, Japanese militarism occupied this naval port; in 1898, Tsarist Russia seized and leased Lushun and Dalian with the merit of the Three-Power Intervention; after the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War in 1904, Japanese militarism reoccupied Lushun, and thus was long held by the Japanese until liberation in 1945; in 1955, the Soviet army withdrew, and the Soviet government transferred the facilities of the Lushun naval port to China free of charge. This historical experience lasted for sixty years." In this way, the ten-year period of Soviet military administration after the liberation of Lushun was also included in the "tragic history," which is a serious error. Xinhua News Agency reported that this was "viciously undermining Sino-Soviet friendship," and I cannot shirk my responsibility. Although I did not intend to do so subjectively, I examined why I wrote this seriously flawed passage. There are reasons: (1) Because I thought I was familiar with this history, I wrote it down without careful consideration, resulting in a serious logical error without realizing it. Treating my own articles so carelessly and unseriously is really a self-defeating attitude. (2) It is because narrow nationalism still exists in the depths of my mind. I have studied modern diplomatic history, and when I mention the history of Lushun, it is tragic. In August 1945, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan, and the Soviet army liberated the northern part of Korea and Northeast China. Japanese militarism was thus forced to surrender unconditionally, which was an extremely crucial event. China's eight-year war of resistance against Japan thus won the final victory, especially the key event. At that time, I was in Chongqing and was influenced by American and British propaganda, and I had an incorrect impression of this key event that did not conform to the actual situation. Now I fully understand the truth of history. The Soviet Union's participation in the war within three months after the surrender of Fascist Germany was stipulated in the Yalta Agreement. Therefore, the Soviet Union defeated Germany on May 9, 1945, and declared war on Japan on August 8, which was fulfilling the provisions of the Yalta Agreement. The date of the Soviet Union's declaration of war on Japan was notified to the United States in advance. In order to dilute the importance of the Soviet Union's declaration of war on Japan and give the world a confusing impression that the United States defeated Japan, Truman unnecessarily and very insidiously and sinfully dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima on August 6, two days before the Soviet Union's scheduled participation in the war, and dropped a second atomic bomb on Nagasaki on August 9, the day after the Soviet Union declared war on Japan. This criminal, Truman, killed more than 200,000 Japanese people with one bloody hand, just to cover up the Soviet Union's military achievements in the war against Japan. I was deceived by this at the time, so my impression of the Soviet army's participation in the war, defeating the stubborn Japanese Kwantung Army, and liberating Northeast China was not deep enough; although I later clarified the truth of this history, the first wrong impression still lurks in my subconscious. These erroneous consciousnesses become objective existences, and they will not be eradicated without deep excavation. The problem is manifested in my article "A Short Trip to Lushun." If I had paid enough attention to the Soviet Union's declaration of war on Japan and the liberation of Northeast China, when I wrote this short article and described the history of Lushun, I would naturally have divided the old and new periods from the liberation in August 1945, and I would naturally have expressed my gratitude to the Soviet army. Although I have undergone ideological reform and many studies in the eight years since liberation, and I think I have made some progress, the old ideological consciousness is still very strong lurking in my mind, and it will be revealed if I am not careful. The error in this "A Short Trip to Lushun" is a shocking example.

      A stumbling block in the ideological transformation of intellectuals

Narrow nationalism is a stumbling block in the ideological transformation of intellectuals, and I personally deeply feel this. Recalling the spring of 1949, when I came to Beiping from Hong Kong, it was the first lesson for me to join the people's team of New China and receive ideological reform education. At that time, the most difficult link to untie in my mind was narrow nationalism.

I am an old intellectual who has worked under the reactionary rule of old China for a long time. When I first came to the liberated area, all impressions were brand new. The three points that impressed me the most at that time were: (1) Under the government of the people's government, the government staff truly served the people, which was completely different from the "official world" of old China. (2) In the liberated area, I saw the real life of the people and the power shown by the people. Compared with the dying situation in the Chiang-controlled area, they were clearly two worlds.
  (3) I saw the greatness of the political education of the People's Liberation Army, and thus realized that the Liberation War was not a simple war of revenge, but a war based on a set of philosophy, overcoming all tangible and intangible enemies from a class standpoint. Due to these profound impressions, I reflected on: (1) I, an old intellectual who is accustomed to climbing up in the established reactionary society, must climb back from mid-air, step on the ground, and return to the masses of the people from life to consciousness; (2) I should deny the work I have done in the past that is divorced from the interests of the people and even harms the interests of the people, surrender to the people's camp led by the proletariat, and serve the people loyally under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. I figured out these problems, but the last problem blocked my ideological progress, that is: the misunderstanding of the Soviet Union under the obstacle of narrow nationalism. In the current international relations, isn't the Soviet Union also a country that implements power politics? Will the Chinese Communist Party's policy towards the Soviet Union make New China a vassal of the Soviet Union? This confused thinking based on narrow nationalism was troubling me at the time. At that time, after the patient help and guidance of several comrades, and after repeated thinking, I finally figured out this problem. I happily wrote an article called "I Came to the Liberated Area," in which I wrote the following paragraph:

    "I reflected on: There is a misunderstanding of the Soviet Union shrouded in the international concept prevailing among the petty bourgeoisie. They do not understand the theoretical system of Marxism-Leninism, nor do they understand the common position of the proletariat. Therefore, they also equate the Soviet Union with American and British imperialism. Looking at the current international relations with the eyes of power politics, they think that the Soviet Union is also a contender in the power politics of horizontal and vertical integration. In fact, if you grasp the class position, you will understand that the Soviet Union, which pursues Marxism-Leninism, is the leader of the world proletariat and the lighthouse of socialism. Its struggle with imperialism is to free the majority of mankind in the world from shackles, so that mankind will never have a system of man exploiting man, and realize a socialist society of 'from each according to his ability, to each according to his work.' The national position is also unified with the class position. In the national position, the Soviet Union sympathizes with all oppressed nations and helps them achieve liberation. In this position, the Soviet Union is a revolutionary force in the world, not an aggressive force."

    This article was written in early April 1949. Reading this paragraph again today can still be used as a medicine to overcome my latent consciousness of narrow nationalism. In the final analysis, this is a question of class position. As long as we can stand on the proletarian position, we will correctly realize that the nature of the Soviet state is fundamentally different from that of the imperialist countries such as the United States and Britain. The Soviet Union is a socialist country of proletarian dictatorship. It has eliminated the system of man exploiting man at home, opposes aggression abroad, implements a policy of peace, advocates peaceful coexistence with all countries, and conducts peaceful competition. The great ambition of the proletariat is to liberate all mankind before liberating itself, so the Soviet Union is consistent with the class position on the national issue. The Soviet Union's national policy internally implements equality and autonomy for all ethnic groups in the country, and externally advocates the liberation of all oppressed nations, sympathizes with and assists the liberation struggles of all oppressed nations, so as to realize the equality, independence and freedom of all nations in the world. This is the consistent spirit of the Marxist-Leninist national policy. As soon as the October Revolution was successful, the Soviet government passed the "Declaration of Rights of the Peoples of Russia," announcing "? All peoples of Russia are equal and autonomous; ? All peoples of Russia have the free right to self-determination, up to separation and the formation of independent states; ? Abolish all national and national religious privileges and restrictions; ? All ethnic minorities and ethnic groups in Russia have freedom of development." For forty years, the Soviet Union has consistently implemented this correct national policy, and the unity and development of fraternal friendship among all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union has become a brilliant example in human history. This is the internal aspect of the Soviet national policy. In terms of foreign affairs, take Sino-Soviet relations as an example: Lenin has always sympathized with and supported the revolutionary movement of the Chinese people. As soon as the October Revolution was successful, the Soviet government announced the abolition of all unequal treaties imposed on China during the Tsarist Russia era. The Soviet Union actually supported the Chinese revolution. Even after the failure of the revolution, when Chiang Kai-shek committed the crime of anti-Soviet and anti-Communist, when Japanese militarism launched a war of aggression against China, the Soviet Union still aided China's war of resistance against Japan through the Chiang Kai-shek government. After the Soviet Union won the great victory of the Great Patriotic War, before it could catch its breath, it wielded its troops eastward, declared war on Japan, and defeated the Kwantung Army, which was the last gamble of Japanese militarism, and liberated Northeast China. This is such a great spirit of internationalism, and the entire Chinese people are sincerely grateful. However, feudal warlords and landlord class elements like Long Yun have always been anti-Soviet. Not only do they not thank the Soviet army for its great contribution to liberating Northeast China, but they also slander the Soviet Union for dismantling some factory machines in Northeast China. The problem is very clear. If those machines were not removed at that time, they would have fallen into the hands of the United States and Chiang Kai-shek in the future, and the Chinese people would have had to pay a lot more blood in the war to liberate Northeast China. After liberation, the Soviet Union used huge machine equipment and excellent technology to help us build modern large-scale industries in Northeast China. By comparison, those old machines in the past were really insignificant. People with ulterior motives always use this matter to carry out anti-Soviet agitation. In addition, there are some short-sighted people who always only see the small and do not see the big. Regarding the Lushunkou issue, the "Sino-Soviet Agreement on the Chinese Changchun Railway, Lushunkou and Dalian" when the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance was concluded in February 1950 stipulated that it was absolutely necessary to jointly use the Lushunkou naval base before the conclusion of the peace treaty with Japan. At that time, New China had just been born, and its national defense had not yet been consolidated. Our alliance with the Soviet Union and the joint use of the Lushun port with the Soviet army played a huge stabilizing role in China's Northeast national defense. When the victory of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea was won and our Northeast national defense was consolidated, the Soviet army withdrew in 1955, although the peace treaty with Japan had not yet been concluded, and transferred the equipment of the Lushun naval port to China free of charge. The Soviet Union's open, aboveboard, great, and selfless spirit of internationalism is really as bright as the sun and stars, and everyone in the world can see it. I understand this major event that demonstrates the great friendship between China and the Soviet Union and is related to peace and security in the Far East; it is only because I have remnants of narrow nationalist thought that when I mentioned the history of Lushun, I did not make a specific analysis, and errors appeared in my short article "A Short Trip to Lushun." This is a lesson I should learn and be seriously vigilant about.

    China and the Soviet Union are both socialist countries of proletarian dictatorship, and Sino-Soviet relations are brotherly and comradely relations. This extraordinary relationship must be correctly understood by standing on the common position of the proletariat. Only by standing on the common position of the proletariat can we intimately understand why the Soviet Union is so generous and selfless in helping our country's socialist construction. Whenever we have difficulties and wherever we have needs, Soviet assistance comes. In the common struggle to defend international peace, the relationship between the Soviet Union and our country fully demonstrates the relationship of brothers, comrades, and comrades-in-arms. Imperialism always wants to provoke relations between China and the Soviet Union, trying to find a gap here to differentiate the socialist camp. Their despicable attempts always become illusions and always end in shameful failure. This is because the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people united on the principles of Marxism-Leninism is unbreakable.

        How to view the powerful existence of the Soviet Union?

    The Soviet Union is the first socialist country in human history. After forty years of struggle and construction, it exists powerfully on the international stage. How to view this huge fact can distinguish people's factions and positions.

    Imperialism, bourgeois rightists, and all counter-revolutionaries regard the Soviet Union as their disaster and as their gravedigger; because the Soviet Union opposes aggression, oppression, and exploitation, and will eventually liberate all mankind and realize a socialist-communist society that eliminates exploitation, eliminates aggression, and eliminates oppression, all reactionaries will naturally be anti-Soviet.

    Socialist countries, the working people of the world, and all peace-loving and just people in the world regard the Soviet Union as the hope for the liberation and happiness of all mankind and as a strong fortress for defending world peace. The fact is indeed the case. Because of the powerful existence of the Soviet Union, it tells the working people of the world that the socialist-communist society indicated by Marxism-Leninism is a reality, the world system of the socialist camp is firmly established, world wars can indeed be stopped, and international peace can indeed be striven for. Isn't this the greatest hope of all honest and progressive people in the world? Therefore, all workers, revolutionaries, and honest and progressive people in the world are pro-Soviet.

    Everyone think about it: If it were not for the powerful existence of the Soviet Union, would American imperialism not let go of its conspiracy to conquer the world, and could world peace be maintained? If it were not for the powerful existence of the Sino-Soviet alliance, could the People's Republic of China develop as safely as it is now? Could our War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea movement be victorious? Could American imperialism not further carry out military aggression against our country after controlling Taiwan? If it were not for the powerful existence of the Soviet Union, could the vicious incident in Hungary be resolved so favorably to peace and socialism? If it were not for the powerful existence of the Soviet Union, could the war of aggression against Egypt launched by imperialism be stopped? If it were not for the powerful existence of the Soviet Union, wouldn't the American atomic madmen be even more rampant? Thinking of all this, we will know whose interests the powerful existence of the Soviet Union is for. If we think through this principle, we will know how absolutely correct Chairman Mao Zedong's "leaning to one side" pro-Soviet policy is. Being united with the Soviet Union is China's absolute interest; consolidating and developing Sino-Soviet friendship is the highest international obligation of the Chinese people. Our policy of "leaning to one side" towards the Soviet Union is not only absolutely correct now, but will always be absolutely correct in the future. This is determined by the principles of Marxism-Leninism and by the common social system of China and the Soviet Union.

    Another problem that narrow nationalists cannot understand is the issue of the Soviet Union taking the lead. In February of this year, in order to commemorate the seventh anniversary of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, I published an article in the "Sino-Soviet Friendship News" entitled "Must Take the Soviet Union as the Leader." I said: "The unity of socialist countries is related to the safety of world peace and the happiness of mankind; and the unity of socialist countries must take the Soviet Union as the leader." This has the following reasons: ? The Soviet Union is the first socialist country in human history, and it has put the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, which liberates all mankind, into practice; ? The Soviet Union has forty years of experience in building socialism, and is a treasure trove of knowledge for building socialism and communism; ? The Soviet Union is now the second largest industrial power in the world, and many of its scientific achievements surpass the United States and reach the peak of the world; ? The Soviet Union is the most capable of helping socialist countries and peace-loving countries, and many major facts have proven this since World War II; ? The Soviet Union is the central force for defending world peace. The Soviet Union has the above five conditions, which cannot be replaced by other countries, so the unity of socialist countries must take the Soviet Union as the leader.
             ×××
    The narrow nationalism and various issues related to the Soviet Union discussed above, I thought I had figured them out, but I did not know that a very strong narrow nationalism was still lurking in my old consciousness. I deeply feel that in the bourgeois ideological system, narrow nationalism is a very stubborn thing, and it becomes a stumbling block in the ideological transformation of intellectuals. I still have to seriously examine my thoughts, continue to study Marxism-Leninism, and strive to overcome narrow nationalism in order to further transform myself.

    必须克服狭隘的民族主义
    王芸生
    狭隘的民族主义的危害性
    民族主义，在受压迫被掠夺的弱小国家里，当它们反抗帝国主义侵略以争取民族独立和解放的时候，是具有革命性和进步性的，这如同我国在过去长期反帝国主义斗争的情形和现今一些亚非国家争取民族独立斗争的情形。超越了这个范围，民族主义就失了进步性，而是反动的了。因为民族主义是属于资产阶级思想体系的。自从历史上出现了资产阶级，它就懂得用民族主义挑起不同民族的劳动人民之间的民族纠纷，以巩固它的统治。在帝国主义时代，资产阶级更懂得利用民族主义的骗人口号，驱策人民群众，参加侵略战争，进行民族掠夺。在社会主义国家，是用无产阶级国际主义来对抗资产阶级民族主义，用民族自决权的要求来对抗资产阶级民族压迫政策。在我国是实行民族自治，我们这样做，是有利于反帝国主义的。作为资产阶级思想体系中的东西，我们是反对民族主义的。“简明哲学辞典”说：“共产党为反对人们意识中的资本主义残余，其中包括资产阶级民族主义的各种表现进行着斗争。人们意识中的资本主义残余，在民族问题领域内要比其他任何一个领域内更富有生命力。”中国还是极年轻的社会主义国家，在我们国家里，经济上的生产资料私有制是基本上消灭了，而在政治战线和思想战线上社会主义和资本主义谁战胜谁的问题还没有真正解决，资产阶级思想还大量存在，在民族问题领域内资产阶级思想更是不少。所有的民族主义都是狭隘性的，它的表现是各式各样的。它表现在国内各兄弟民族关系上的，我们多数民族表现为大汉族主义，各少数民族表现为地方民族主义，这当然是危害国内各民族的友爱团结的；它表现在国际关系上的，大国表现为大民族主义（或称大国主义），对兄弟国家表现为狭隘的民族主义，这当然是危害国与国间的友好团结的。所以狭隘的民族主义是一种有害的属于资产阶级思想体系的东西，必须加以克服。
    狭隘的民族主义，对于知识分子的危害性特别大，也特别深刻。就因为民族主义在受压迫被侵略的殖民地半殖民地民族国家反帝国主义斗争中具有进步性以至革命性的一面，狭隘的民族主义往往穿着“爱国主义”的外衣而出现。与无产阶级国际主义相结合的爱国主义，才是真正的革命的爱国主义；否则，实质上是资产阶级的民族主义，是反动性质的。知识分子多数是有爱国心的，也喜欢标榜爱国；但是，若不把爱国主义和狭隘的民族主义加以区分，就会无意地或者有意地假爱国之名，干反动之实。革命的和向往革命的知识分子，必须站稳无产阶级的立场，受到无产阶级国际主义的教育和锻炼，然后才能逐步克服狭隘的民族主义，达到国际主义与爱国主义相结合的境界。
          “旅顺小记”是一个例子
    在整风运动和反右派斗争的学习中，我就发现我有狭隘的民族主义思想残余。
    一个具体的例子，去年八月号的“旅行家”杂志上发表一篇我所写的“旅顺小记”，其中就有狭隘民族主义的错误。文中记旅顺军事博物馆门前陈列的大坦克，明明写着：“这个大坦克曾经参加过斯大林格勒保卫战和攻克柏林的战役，然后掉转头来，来到旅顺。旅顺的新历史就由此开始。”这是对的，而下一段却紧接着这样写：“旅顺以往的历史是惨痛的。1894年甲午战争，日本军国主义攻占了这个军港；1898年沙俄挟三国干涉之功占租了旅大；1904年日俄战争爆发后，日本军国主义再占旅顺，由此长陷日手；至1945年解放；1955年苏军撤退，苏联政府将旅顺军港设备无偿地交给中国。这段历史经历是六十年。”就这样前后矛盾地将旅顺解放后苏军代管的十年时期也算入“惨痛的历史”里去了。这是严重的错误。新华社通讯说这是“恶毒地破坏中苏友谊”，我是不能辞其咎的。尽管我主观上无此用心，我检查我之所以写出这段严重错误的东西，是有原因的：（一）因为我自以为熟悉这段历史，就不加周密思考而顺笔写下，以致搞出逻辑上的严重错误而不自觉。对待自己的文章如此地不认真，不严肃，实在是一种自暴自弃的态度。（二）就是因为我的思想深处还有狭隘的民族主义。我搞过近代外交史，提到旅顺的历史就是惨痛的。1945年8月，苏联对日宣战，苏军解放了朝鲜的北部和我国的东北，日本军国主义由此被迫无条件投降，乃是极为关键的大事，我国的八年抗战由此获得最后胜利，尤其是关键的大事。当时我在重庆，受美英宣传的影响，对这种关键性的大事有不符合实际情况的错误印象。现在已完全明白了历史的真相，苏联于法西斯德国投降后三个月内参加作战，是雅尔塔协定规定的，所以苏联于1945年5月9日战胜了德国，即于8月8日对日本宣战，是履行雅尔塔协定的规定。苏联对日本宣战的日期是预先通知了美国的，杜鲁门为了冲淡苏联对日宣战的重要性，给世人以是美国战胜日本的混乱印象，他毫无必要地也非常阴险罪恶地于苏联预定参战的前两天8月6日向广岛投下了原子弹，又于苏联对日宣战的第二天8月9日向长崎投下了第二颗原子弹。杜鲁门这个罪犯，他一只血手杀害了二十多万日本人民的生命，只是为了掩蔽苏联对日作战的军功。我当时就受了这种蒙蔽，所以对苏军参战，击溃了顽强的日本关东军并解放我东北的印象不够深刻；以后虽然弄清楚了这段历史的真相，而第一个错误印象总还是潜伏在我的下意识里。这些错误的意识成为客观存在，不经过深刻的挖掘，是不会除根的。问题就表现在我这篇“旅顺小记”里。我若是对苏联对日宣战并解放我国东北有足够的重视，我写这篇小文，叙述旅顺的历史，自然就会从1945年8月的解放划分新旧两个时期，也自然会对苏军表示感谢的心情。解放八年多来，我虽然经过思想改造和许多学习，自以为有了一些进步，而旧的思想意识仍旧很浓重地潜伏在我的头脑里，稍不经心，就会流露出来。这篇“旅顺小记”的错误，就是一个可惊的例子。
      知识分子思想改造的一块绊脚石
    狭隘的民族主义，是知识分子思想改造的一块绊脚石，我个人是深深有此体会的。回想1949年春天，我从香港来到当时的北平，是我投到新中国的人民队伍中受思想改造教育的第一课，当时在我思想中最难解开的一环就是狭隘的民族主义。
    我是一个旧知识分子，长期在旧中国的反动统治下工作，初到解放区来，一切印象都是崭新的。我当时印象最深刻的有三点：（一）在人民政府的政权下，政府的工作人员都是真正地为人民服务，绝不同于旧中国的“官世界”。（二）在解放区，我看到了真正的人的生活和人民所表现的力量，和蒋管区的垂死情况相比，判然两个世界。
  （三）我看到了人民解放军政治教育的伟大，从而认识到解放战争不是单纯的复仇的战争，而是有一套哲学作基础，从阶级立场上，去克服一切有形和无形敌人的战争。由于这几点深刻的印象，使我反省到：（一）我这个习惯于在既成的反动社会里向上爬的旧知识分子，由生活到意识，都必须由半悬空中爬回来，脚踏实地回到人民群众中来；（二）我应该否定我过去所做的脱离人民利益的以至损害人民利益的工作，向无产阶级领导的人民阵营投降，在中国共产党领导下，忠诚地为人民服务。这些问题我都想通了，而最后一个问题挡住了我的思想前进，这就是：在狭隘的民族主义这块绊脚石的障碍下对苏联的误解。在当前的国际关系中，苏联不也是一个施行强权政治的国家吗？中国共产党的对苏政策会不会使新中国成为苏联的附庸？我这种基于狭隘的民族主义而产生的糊涂思想，当时是在困恼着我。当时经过几位同志的耐心地帮助和指导，经过反复思索，我终于搞通了这个问题。我很愉快地写了“我到解放区来”一文，在那篇文章中，我写了以下一段话：
    “我反省到：流行于小资产阶级的国际观念中，笼罩着一种对苏联的误解。他们不懂得马列主义的理论体系，也不了解无产阶级的共同立场，因此也将苏联与美英帝国主义等量齐观。用强权政治的眼光看当前的国际关系，以为苏联也是强权政治中纵横捭阖的角逐者。其实，若把握定了阶级立场，就会懂得，奉行马列主义的苏联，它是世界无产阶级的领导者，社会主义的灯塔。它与帝国主义搏斗，是为了挣脱世界大多数人类的枷锁，使人类永无人剥削人的制度，实现‘各尽所能，按劳取酬’的社会主义的社会。在民族立场上，也与阶级立场相统一。苏联在民族立场上，它同情一切被压迫的民族，而援助他们获得解放。在此立场上，苏联在世界上是革命势力，决不是侵略势力。”
    这篇文章写于1949年4月初旬，今天重读这一段话，还可作为我克服狭隘民族主义潜在意识的药石。归根到底，这是一个阶级立场的问题。只要能够站在无产阶级的立场上，我们就会正确地认识到，苏联国家的性质根本不同于美英等帝国主义国家。苏联是无产阶级专政的社会主义国家，它在国内消灭了人剥削人的制度，对外反对侵略，执行和平政策，主张与一切国家和平共处，进行和平竞赛。无产阶级的伟大抱负，是解放了全人类而后解放自己，所以苏联在民族问题上是和阶级立场相一致的。苏联的民族政策，对内实行国内各族人民一律平等和自主，对外主张解放一切被压迫的民族，同情和援助一切被压迫民族的解放斗争，以实现世界一切民族的一律独立和自由。这是马克思列宁主义的民族政策的一贯精神。十月革命刚一成功，苏维埃政府就通过了“俄国各民族人民权利宣言”，宣布“?俄国各族人民一律平等和自主；?俄国各族人民具有自由的自决权，直至分立和组成独立国家；?废除一切民族的和民族宗教的特权和限制；?俄国境内各少数民族和民族集团均得自由发展。”四十年来苏联一贯执行这一正确的民族政策，苏联各族兄弟友谊的团结和发展成为人类历史上的光辉范例。这是苏联民族政策的对内一面。在对外方面，以中苏关系为例：列宁是一贯同情和支持中国人民的革命运动的，十月革命刚一成功，苏维埃政府就宣布废除帝俄时代的对华一切不平等条约。苏联实际支持中国的大革命运动，即在大革命失败后，蒋介石犯着反苏反共的罪恶，当日本军国主义发动对中国的侵略战争时，苏联还是通过蒋介石政府，援助中国的对日抗战。苏联取得伟大卫国战争的胜利之后，喘息未定，就挥戈东指，对日宣战，击溃了作为日本军国主义最后赌本的关东军，解放了我国的东北。这是多么伟大的国际主义精神，全中国人民都衷心感谢。但是，像龙云那样的军阀地主阶级分子，他一贯反苏，他非但不感谢苏军解放我东北的伟大功绩，还要诽谤苏联拆走了东北若干工厂的机器。问题很清楚，当时如果不把那些机器拿开，以后落在美蒋手里，中国人民在解放东北的战争中就要多付出许多鲜血。解放以后，苏联以庞大的机器装备和优良的技术帮助我们在东北建设起现代大工业来，两相比较，从前的那些旧机器，真是微不足道。别有用心的人，则总是用这件事进行反苏煽惑。另外也有一些鼠目寸光的人，总是只看小的，不见大的。关于旅顺口问题，1950年2月缔结中苏友好同盟时的“中苏关于中国长春铁路、旅顺口及大连的协定”，规定在对日和约缔结前，共同使用旅顺口海军根据地，是完全必要的。那时新中国诞生不久，国防尚未巩固，我们和苏联缔结同盟关系，与苏联军队共同使用旅顺港，对我国的东北国防起了巨大的安定作用。等到抗美援朝胜利了，我东北国防巩固了，虽然对日和约尚未缔结，苏军就于1955年撤退，并将旅顺军港的设备无偿地移交中国。苏联这种光明磊落伟大无私的国际主义精神，真是炳若日星，世人皆见。我是明白这件表现着中苏伟大友谊并且关系着远东和平安危的大事的；只是因为我有狭隘的民族主义思想残余，提到旅顺历史，不作具体分析，就在“旅顺小记”那篇小文里冒出错误来。这是我应该引为教训而加以严重警惕的。
    中国和苏联，同是无产阶级专政的社会主义国家，中苏关系乃是兄弟般的同志式的关系，这种迥异寻常的关系，必须站在无产阶级的共同立场上，才能正确地理解。只有站在无产阶级的共同立场上，我们才能亲切地理解到：苏联为什么这样慷慨无私地帮助我国的社会主义建设。我们在什么地方有困难和在什么地方有需要，苏联的援助就来了。在为保卫国际和平的共同斗争上，苏联和我国的关系，充分表现着兄弟、同志和战友的关系。帝国主义总想挑拨中苏两国的关系，企图在这里找出向社会主义阵营进行分化的缺口，它们的卑鄙企图总是成为幻梦，总是落个可耻的失败。这就因为在马克思列宁主义的原则上团结起来的中苏两国人民的兄弟友谊是牢不可破的。
        怎样看待苏联的强大存在？
    苏联是人类第一个社会主义国家，经过四十年的奋斗和建设，强大存在于国际舞台上。怎样看待这个巨大的事实，就可以区分出人们的派别立场。
    帝国主义、资产阶级右派以及一切反革命分子，都把苏联看成是他们的灾祸，都把苏联看成是他们的掘墓者；因为苏联反侵略、反压迫、反剥削，最后要解放全人类，实现消灭剥削、消灭侵略和压迫的社会主义—共产主义的社会，一切反动派就自然要反苏。
    社会主义国家、全世界劳动人民以及全世界一切爱好和平正义的人们，都把苏联看成是全人类获得解放和幸福的希望，都把苏联看成是保卫世界和平的坚强堡垒。事实正是如此，由于苏联的强大存在，就告诉全世界劳动人民，马克思列宁主义所指示的社会主义—共产主义社会是现实的，社会主义阵营的世界体系坚强地建立起来了，世界战争的确是可以制止、国际和平的确是可以争取的了。全世界的正直进步人类的最大希望不就是这些吗？因此，全世界一切劳动者、革命派、正直进步的人，都是亲苏的。
    大家想一想：若不是有苏联强大存在，美国帝国主义还不放手进行征服全世界的阴谋，世界和平还能保持吗？若不是有中苏同盟强大存在，中华人民共和国能够像现在这样地安全发展吗？我们的抗美援朝运动能够胜利吗？美国帝国主义控制台湾以后能够不进一步向我国进行军事侵略吗？若不是有苏联强大存在，匈牙利的凶恶事变能够这样有利于和平和社会主义而平定吗？若不是有苏联强大存在，帝国主义已经发动的侵略埃及的战争能够制止下去吗？若不是有苏联强大存在，美国的原子狂还不要更加猖狂吗？想到这一切，就会知道苏联的强大存在究竟是谁的利益了。想通了这个道理，我们就会知道毛泽东主席
  “一边倒”的亲苏政策是怎样绝对正确的了。和苏联团结在一起，是中国的绝对利益；巩固和发展中苏友谊，是中国人民最高的国际义务。我们向苏联“一边倒”的政策，不仅现在绝对正确，即在将来也永远是绝对正确的。这就决定于马克思列宁主义的原则，决定于中苏两国的共同的社会制度。
    狭隘的民族主义者还有一个搞不通的问题，就是以苏联为首的问题。今年2月，为了纪念中苏友好同盟七周年，我在“中苏友好报”发表了一篇题为“必须以苏联为首”的文章，我说：“社会主义国家的团结，关系着世界和平的安危和人类的幸福；而社会主义国家的团结必须以苏联为首。”这有以下几项理由：?苏联是人类第一个社会主义国家，马克思列宁主义这一解放全人类的普遍真理由它付诸实践；?苏联具有建设社会主义的四十年经验，是建设社会主义和共产主义的知识宝库；?苏联现在是世界上第二个工业强国，科学上许多成就超过美国，达到世界的高峰；?苏联最能帮助社会主义国家和爱好和平的国家，自第二次世界大战到现在，有许多重大事实作了证明；?苏联是保卫世界和平的中心力量。苏联具有上述五项条件，皆是别的国家所不能代替的，所以社会主义国家的团结必须以苏联为首。

    以上所谈的狭隘民族主义和有关苏联的各个问题，我自己以为是我曾经搞清楚了的，殊不知在我的旧意识里还潜伏着很浓重的狭隘的民族主义。我深深地感到，在资产阶级思想体系中，狭隘的民族主义是一件很顽固的东西，它成为知识分子思想改造的一块绊脚石。我还得认真检查我的思想，继续学习马克思列宁主义，努力克服狭隘的民族主义，才能使自己获得进一步的改造。
