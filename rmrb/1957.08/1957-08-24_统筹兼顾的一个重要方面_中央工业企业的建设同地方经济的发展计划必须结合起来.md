An Important Aspect of Overall Planning and Consideration
The Construction of Central Industrial Enterprises Must Be Combined with Local Economic Development Plans
By Our Staff Commentator

During the period of the First Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy in our country, the construction of enterprises managed by the central government and the economic undertakings of the local governments have both made great progress. It is estimated that by the end of 1957, among the construction units of factories and mines above the designated size, the units under construction will reach 825, of which 700 are managed by various ministries of the central government and 125 are managed by local governments; the units completed will reach 448, of which 377 are managed by various ministries of the central government and 71 are managed by local governments. As everyone knows, during the First Five-Year Plan, there were also about 2,300 factory and mine construction units below the designated size, of which about 1,400 were managed by local governments. The vast majority of these construction units have been completed and put into production. Therefore, the output value of industrial enterprises managed by the central government will increase by 1.7 times in 1957 compared to 1952; the output value of industrial enterprises managed by local governments will increase by 2.24 times. It can be seen that the achievements of our country's industrial construction are very great. No matter how hard the rightists try, they cannot change this commonly recognized fact.

Taking Heilongjiang Province in the northern frontier of the motherland as an example, by 1949, state-owned and locally state-owned factories and mines in the province had developed to 542. By 1956, the province had developed to nearly 1,000 factory and mining enterprises. Judging only from the factories and mining enterprises managed by the local government, they have developed from 221 in 1950 to 712. In 1956, the province's total industrial output value exceeded three times the highest year before liberation, 1943, while the industrial output value managed by the local government exceeded 16 times. The development of industries managed by the central government and industries managed by the local government in Heilongjiang Province is a basic microcosm of the development of industry in our country.

However, when some industrial departments of the central government construct new enterprises, they lack thorough consideration of the relationship between these newly built enterprises and the local economic development plan, resulting in the phenomenon of newly built industrial enterprises squeezing out existing local industrial enterprises in some areas. This situation has also occurred between new industrial enterprises built by local governments and the original small industries and handicrafts.

For example, according to the inspection by Sichuan Province, from 1952 to 1954, the coal produced by the large coal mines managed by the central government had difficulty in sales. When reducing production, a large number of small coal kilns were inappropriately squeezed out in some areas. In Jiangjin Prefecture alone, the number was reduced from more than 1,000 before liberation to 96, which brought great difficulties to the local area when coal supply was insufficient in 1956. In the arrangement of salt production, the method of "cutting and abolishing" was also inappropriately adopted for small salt wells. Since 1952, 15 small salt wells have been cut and abolished, and 8 small salt wells have been half-abolished. On the one hand, the state has allocated resettlement expenses for approximately 22,000 employees, and on the other hand, it has invested 4 million yuan in Ziliujing to expand large salt wells, and use open-hearth salt to replace the Ba salt and Dahua salt welcomed by the masses. This method of squeezing small with large and concentrating production has resulted in unreasonable phenomena such as long-distance transportation, increased selling price, and the masses being unwilling to buy. Therefore, the inventory backlog reached 2 million dan, and new warehouses need to be built for storage. In the arrangement of production in some industries, the method of squeezing out enterprises with backward equipment and production methods with new advanced large enterprises has also occurred. For example, in the production of sugar, since 1955, the focus has been on developing mechanized sugar production in Neijiang, and the Neijiang Sugar Factory and Qiu Xihe Sugar Factory with a daily crushing capacity of 1,200 tons and 500 tons have been built. Although large sugar factories have accumulated a lot for the country (accumulating more than 44 million yuan for the country in five years, including more than 16.4 million yuan in 1957 alone), after the completion of the Neijiang Sugar Factory, it affected the supply of raw materials to the Sanyuan and Maoshi factories, reduced the equipment utilization rate of the two factories. At the same time, the Neijiang Sugar Factory needs more than 10,000 farmers to cut and transport sugarcane. In 1956, due to insufficient labor and untimely sugarcane supply, the factory was shut down for 571 hours, reducing sugar production by about 2,000 tons. According to the above practice, between industrial enterprises managed by the central government and industrial enterprises managed by local governments, and between newly built industrial enterprises and existing industrial enterprises, not only can they not promote each other's development, but they also show the phenomenon of offsetting each other's strengths. Although this phenomenon is extremely rare or individual, it is detrimental to the development of our country's economy and must be corrected.

The above-mentioned phenomena are mainly caused by two reasons: one is the local viewpoint of some construction units and units that approve basic construction projects; the other is some shortcomings in the current basic construction planning system.

In order to correct the shortcomings mentioned above, so that the construction of enterprises managed by the central government is closely combined with the local economic development, and the newly built industrial enterprises are closely combined with the existing industrial enterprises, first of all, the overall viewpoint of the construction units and units that approve construction projects should be strengthened to overcome the local viewpoint. That is to say, when determining industrial construction projects, the construction units and units that approve construction projects must comprehensively consider the resource conditions, transportation conditions, needs, and production capacity of local central industrial enterprises and local industrial enterprises, including the production capacity of small industries and handicrafts in the construction area, so that the central industrial enterprises and local industrial enterprises, and the newly built industrial enterprises and existing industries and handicrafts can promote each other's development, instead of squeezing each other and offsetting strength. Anyone who does this has a global perspective, which is conducive to the development of the entire national economy and is welcomed by the people. Anyone who does not do this, but only proceeds from the needs of their own department and unit, and does not consider the specific conditions of the construction area, has a local viewpoint, which is harmful to the overall development of the national economy and is not welcomed by the people, so we should resolutely support the former and resolutely oppose the latter.

Secondly, our current basic construction planning system basically guarantees the successful implementation of basic construction work, which is visible to everyone. However, with the development of our country's economic construction and the expansion of the scale of basic construction, some new contradictions have also emerged between the current basic construction planning system and the needs of basic construction development. That is, the current basic construction planning system is divided into two systems, central and local. The central professional departments do not manage the basic construction plans of the same profession in the local area; similarly, local governments do not manage the basic construction plans of the central ministries in the local area. In this way, sometimes because they do not communicate with each other and each does its own thing, it causes some unnecessary waste. In the future, a unified basic construction plan for different regions and a nationwide professional basic construction plan for different industries should be prepared, so that the local area can consider the rationality of local industrial construction on the one hand, and also consider the rationality of the construction of industrial enterprises managed by the central government on the other hand. In this way, the central professional departments and comprehensive institutions can also better consider the unified national plan for the entire profession, make appropriate arrangements, and better conduct national balancing on the basis of regional balance. Only in this way can the construction of industrial enterprises managed by the central government be closely combined with the construction of industrial enterprises managed by local governments, and the construction of new industrial enterprises be closely combined with the construction of existing industry and handicrafts. This is of great benefit to promoting mutual development. Not only industrial construction should be like this, but other construction undertakings should also be like this.

    统筹兼顾的一个重要方面
　　中央工业企业的建设同地方经济的发展计划必须结合起来
　　本报评论员
    在我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划期间，中央所管理的企业的建设和地方的经济事业都有很大的发展。预计到1957年底为止，限额以上的厂矿建设单位，施工的单位将达八百二十五个，其中属于中央各部管理的有七百个，属于地方管理的有一百二十五个；竣工的单位将达四百四十八个，其中属于中央各部管理的有三百七十七个，属于地方管理的有七十一个。大家知道，在第一个五年计划期间，限额以下的厂矿建设单位还有两千三百个左右，其中属于地方管理的约为一千四百个左右，这些建设单位，绝大多数都已竣工投入生产。因此中央所管理的工业企业的产值，1957年将比1952年增长一点七倍；地方所管理的工业企业的产值将增加二点二四倍。可见，我国工业建设的成就是非常巨大的，右派分子无论怎样妄费心机，也无法改变这种人所共见的事实。
    以远处祖国北方边疆的黑龙江省为例，截至1949年该省国营和地方国营的厂矿已发展到五百四十二个，而到1956年止，该省已发展到近千个厂矿企业了。单就地方管理的厂矿企业论，也已由1950年的二百二十一个，发展到七百十二个，1956年该省的工业总产值，超过了解放前最高年份1943年的三倍，地方管理的工业产值则超过十六倍。黑龙江省中央管理的工业同地方管理的工业发展的情况，是我国工业发展情况的一个基本缩影。
    但是，中央的某些工业部门在建设新的企业的时候，对于这些新建的企业同当地的经济发展计划之间的关系，缺乏周密的考虑，以致在某些地区发生了新建工业企业排挤当地原有的工业企业的现象。这种情形，在地方所建设的新的工业企业同当地原有的小工业和手工业之间，也曾发生过。
    例如，根据四川省的检查，在1952—1954年，中央管理的大煤矿所产的煤炭，销路有困难，在压缩生产时，在某些地区不适当地挤掉了很大数量的小煤窑，仅江津一个专区，即从解放前一千多个减少为九十六个，以致在1956年煤炭供应不足时，又给地方带来很大的困难。在食盐生产的安排上，对小盐井也不适当地采取了“裁废”的办法。从1952年以来，裁废了十五个小盐井和半废了八个小盐井，一方面国家拨付了约二万二千余职工的转业费，另一方面又在自流井投资四百万元进行大盐井的扩建，并以平炉盐代替群众所欢迎的巴盐和大花盐。这样以大挤小、集中生产的结果，造成长途运输，提高售价，群众不乐于购买等不合理现象，因而库存积压达二百万担，还需要新建仓库保存。对某些行业安排生产中也曾发生过以新的先进的大的企业排挤设备和生产方法落后的企业的办法。如在食糖生产方面，1955年开始集中在内江发展机制糖，建成了日榨一千二百吨和五百吨的内江糖厂和球溪河糖厂。虽然大糖厂为国家积累大（五年中为国家积累了四千四百多万元，其中1957年即为一千六百四十多万元），但是，内江糖厂建成后，影响了三元和茂市两个厂原料的供应，降低了两个厂的设备利用率，同时，内江糖厂需要一万名以上的农民来砍蔗和运蔗，1956年曾因劳动力不足，甘蔗供应不及时而致停车达五百七十一小时，少产糖约二千吨。按照上面的做法，在中央所管理的工业企业同地方所管理的工业企业之间，在新建的工业企业同原有的工业企业之间，不仅不能够相互促进发展，反而发生相互抵销力量的现象。这种现象虽然是极少的或者是个别的，但是对于我国经济的发展是不利的，必须加以纠正。
    上述现象的产生，主要的有两个原因，一是某些建设单位和审批基本建设项目的单位的局部观点；二是现行基本建设计划体制的若干缺点。
    为了纠正上面所说的缺点，使中央所管理的企业的建设同地方经济的发展密切地结合起来，使新建的工业企业同原有的工业企业密切地结合起来，首先应当加强建设单位和审批建设项目的单位的全面观点，克服局部观点。这就是说，在确定工业建设项目的时候，建设单位和审批建设项目的单位必须对于建设地区的资源条件、交通运输条件、需要情况以及当地中央工业企业和地方工业企业的生产能力，包括小工业和手工业的生产能力，加以统盘考虑，以便使中央工业企业同地方工业企业之间，新建的工业企业同原有的工业和手工业之间，能够相互促进发展，而不是相互排挤，抵销力量。凡是这样做的，就是有全局观点；就有利于整个国民经济的发展，就为人民所欢迎。凡不是这样做，而只从本部门本单位需要出发，不考虑建设地区的种种具体条件的，就是局部观点，就有害于国民经济的全面发展，就为人民所不欢迎，所以我们应当坚决支持前者，坚决反对后者。
    其次，我们现行的基本建设计划体制，基本上保证了基本建设工作的胜利进行，这是大家都可以看得见的。但是，随着我国经济建设的发展和基本建设规模的扩大，现行的基本建设计划体制同基本建设发展的需要之间，也出现了一些新的矛盾。这就是目前基本建设的计划体制，分为中央和地方两个系统，中央的专业部不管地方同一专业的基本建设计划；同样，地方政府也不管当地中央各部的基本建设计划。这样，有时因为相互不通声气，各搞一套，造成某些不必要的浪费。今后应当编制分地区的统一的基本建设计划和分行业的全国性的专业的基本建设计划，这样，就可以使地方一方面能够考虑地方工业建设的合理性，另一方面也可能考虑中央所管的工业企业建设的合理性。这样，也可以使中央的各专业部和各综合机构能够更好地考虑整个专业的全国性的统一规划，适当安排，能够在地区平衡的基础上更好地进行全国性的平衡。只有如此，才能够使中央所管理的工业企业的建设同地方所管理的工业企业的建设，新的工业企业的建设同原有工业和手工业的建设密切地结合起来。这对于互相促进发展是有很大的好处的。不仅工业建设应当如此，其它各项建设事业，也应当如此。
