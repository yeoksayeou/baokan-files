Xinhua News Agency, August 21st, Moscow, August 20th (TASS): TASS issued a statement on the Oman situation, stating that the Soviet people warmly sympathize with Oman's just national liberation struggle and resolutely oppose any interference in Oman's internal affairs.

The statement said that the Oman situation should attract the attention of the United Nations, whose task is to maintain world peace and security. Member states of the United Nations have a responsibility to immediately stop the colonialists' armed intervention in Oman and to stop their interference in the internal affairs of the Arab people.

The statement pointed out that the significance of the Omani people's struggle lies in: striving to liberate their motherland, get rid of foreign rule, and achieve complete independence of their motherland. The statement quoted Oman's representative in Cairo, Khalsei, as saying that Oman's independence had long been recognized by Britain and was affirmed in a treaty signed by a British representative. However, after the discovery of huge oil deposits in Oman in 1955, the British army tore up the existing treaty and invaded Oman. The Omani people have been fighting to defend their independence.

The statement recounted many facts of Britain mobilizing its navy, army, and air force, using various modern weapons, slaughtering the Omani people, and suppressing the new upsurge of the Omani people's liberation movement. The statement refuted Britain's defense that it invaded Oman at the request of the Sultan of Muscat. The statement pointed out that this kind of colonialist connection cannot be a reason for the British army to interfere in Oman, because this interference grossly violates the basic principles of international law and the United Nations Charter, and seriously tramples on the basic principles of humanity and morality.

The statement exposed the United States' double-dealing, taking advantage of the Arab people's hatred of British colonialists, pretending to be a peacemaker, attempting to squeeze out Britain to seize Arab oil resources, and establish its own colonial rule in this region. According to newspaper reports, the statement revealed that the United States and Britain had discussed re-dividing the sphere of influence in the Arabian Peninsula in negotiations in London, deciding the fate of the Buraimi Oasis and Oman behind the backs of the Arab people. Dulles had asked Britain to strengthen the suppression of the Omani uprising. American oil monopolies are also trying to use the Omani people's liberation movement to seize Oman's oil resources.

The statement emphasized that the United States' attitude towards the Oman issue once again proves the colonialist nature of the United States' policy in the Near and Middle East. The statement said that the United States organized a reactionary coup in Jordan, created anti-government conspiracies in Syria and Egypt, and instigated Israeli fanatics to provoke Arab countries. All these subversive activities of the United States are implementing the "Dulles-Eisenhower Doctrine." The purpose is to undermine Arab unity, alienate Arab countries, spread suspicion and distrust among them, and then subject them to American rule one by one.

The statement said that the people of all Arab countries unanimously condemned the colonialist policies of Western countries and resolutely demanded that they stop interfering in the internal affairs of Arab countries. The Omani people's struggle has received warm sympathy from the public in India and other Bandung Conference countries, as well as all peace-loving people.

The statement pointed out that the British and American colonialists want to suppress the Omani people's uprising as quickly as possible and end this colonial war before the opening of the 12th United Nations General Assembly, so as to avoid their aggressive policies being exposed to the world. However, they cannot escape responsibility for the bloody crimes committed against the Omani people.

    塔斯社发表声明
    苏联支持阿曼民族解放斗争 　 指责英国犯下血腥罪行美国玩弄两面手法
    新华社21日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科20日讯：塔斯社就阿曼事件发表声明说，苏联人民热烈同情阿曼人民正义的民族解放斗争，并且坚决反对任何对阿曼人民内政的干涉。
    声明说，阿曼事件应当引起任务在于维护世界和平和安全的联合国的注意。联合国会员国有责任立即制止殖民主义者在阿曼的武装干涉和制止它们对阿拉伯人民内政的干涉。
    声明指出，阿曼人民的斗争的意义在于：力求争取解放祖国，摆脱外国的统治，达到祖国完全独立。声明援引阿曼驻开罗代表哈尔塞的话说，阿曼的独立早已为英国所承认，并且在英国代表签了字的条约中得到了肯定。但是在1955年阿曼发现了巨大的石油产地以后，英国军队便撕毁现存的条约而侵入阿曼。阿曼人民为保卫自己的独立一直进行着斗争。
    声明追述了英国调动海陆空军，使用各种现代化武器，屠杀阿曼人民镇压阿曼人民解放运动新的高涨的许多事实。声明驳斥了英国所谓它接受马斯喀特苏丹的请求因而侵入阿曼的辩解。声明指出，这种殖民主义的联系丝毫不能成为英军干涉阿曼的理由，因为这种干涉粗暴地破坏了国际法的基本原则和联合国宪章，而且严重地蹂躏了人道和道义的基本准则。
    声明揭穿美国玩弄两面手法，利用阿拉伯人民对英国殖民主义者的仇恨，装成和事佬，企图排挤英国夺取阿拉伯的石油资源，在这个地区建立自己的殖民主义统治。声明根据报纸消息，揭露美英在伦敦谈判中曾经谈到重新划分阿拉伯半岛的势力范围，背着阿拉伯人民决定布赖米绿洲和阿曼的命运。杜勒斯曾经要求英国加强镇压阿曼起义。而美国的石油垄断组织又企图利用阿曼人民的解放运动来夺取阿曼的石油资源。
    声明强调指出，美国对阿曼问题的态度又一次证明美国在中近东政策的殖民主义性质。声明说，美国在约旦组织反动的政变，在叙利亚和埃及制造了反政府的阴谋，并且唆使以色列狂热集团向阿拉伯国家挑衅。美国这一切颠覆活动就是在实行“杜勒斯—艾森豪威尔主义”。目的是，破坏阿拉伯的团结，离间阿拉伯国家，在它们之间散布猜疑和不信任，而后逐个地使它们服从美国的统治。
    声明说，阿拉伯各国人民一致谴责西方国家殖民主义政策，坚决要求停止它们对阿拉伯国家内政的干涉。阿曼人民的斗争得到了印度和其它万隆会议国家公众以及一切爱好和平的人民的热烈同情。
    声明指出，英美殖民主义者想在第十二届联合国大会开幕前尽速镇压住阿曼人民起义，结束这场殖民战争，以免它们的侵略政策在全世界面前被揭露。但是，它们不能逃避对阿曼人民所犯的血腥罪行的责任。
