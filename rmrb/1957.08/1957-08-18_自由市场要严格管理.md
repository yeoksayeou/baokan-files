The State Council has issued the "Regulations on Prohibiting Nationally Planned Purchased, Unified Purchased Agricultural Products and Other Materials from Entering the Free Market." This is an important measure by the state to continue ensuring the rational distribution of important agricultural products and other materials nationwide, and all regions must earnestly implement it.

In the past ten months, free markets for small native products under state leadership have been opened successively across the country. This has played a positive role in invigorating urban and rural material exchange, stimulating the development of agricultural and sideline production, and promoting state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives to improve their management. It has also solved the problem of "minor blockages" in the small native product market. However, after the opening of the free market for small native products, the scope of the free market was not clearly defined in advance, and the state only stipulated the purchase of a certain proportion of unified purchased materials, with the remaining part allowed to be sold on the market. As a result, some materials subject to planned purchase and unified purchase flowed into the free market. In addition, market management work did not keep up in time, and many local merchants took the opportunity to rush to purchase and resell, arbitrarily raising purchase prices and engaging in speculative and illegal activities. This affected the state's purchase work and brought some unfavorable effects to the national economy. These situations show that the state must strengthen its leadership over the free market.

To strengthen the state's leadership and management of the free market, the scope of the free market must first be clearly defined. The State Council's regulations point out that grain, oil, and cotton are all subject to state planned purchase; flue-cured tobacco, kenaf, and other twenty-two important native products, thirty-eight important Chinese medicinal materials, apples and citrus fruits supplied for export, aquatic products supplied for export and major cities in certain fish-producing areas, waste copper, waste tin, waste lead, waste steel, etc., are all subject to unified purchase by state-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives entrusted by the state. The above two categories of materials are not open to the free market. We believe that as long as the scope of the above regulations is strictly controlled, the negative effects of the free market can be limited.

Why are materials subject to planned purchase and unified purchase not open to the free market? Because these materials are all important materials related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Moreover, due to the backwardness of China's agricultural economy, the growth of production of many agricultural products cannot keep up with the growth of consumption, a situation that is difficult to change in the short term. If the state does not control the necessary sources of these important materials, it will inevitably reduce the supply of industrial raw materials and exports, which will reduce the speed of industrialization, affect the realization of the national economic plan, and hinder the country's construction cause. Since the second half of last year, some people, in order to pursue exorbitant profits, and some enterprises, institutions, and organizations, for the benefit of a few, have taken advantage of the opportunity to open up the free market for small native products, disregarding the state's policies, and illegally transported and purchased certain planned purchased and unified purchased materials before the completion of the state's planned purchase and unified purchase tasks. Coupled with some other reasons, this has affected the completion of the state's planned purchase and unified purchase tasks. For example, grain, the output in 1956 to 1957 increased by 5% compared with the previous year, but the amount of grain purchased by the state decreased by 5%; oil, the output in 1956 to 1957 increased by 12% compared with the previous year, but the amount of unified purchased by the state decreased by 12%; palm fiber, the output in 1957 is expected to increase by 5% compared with 1956, but the amount purchased by the state is expected to decrease by 18% compared with the previous year. There are similar situations in the purchase of other important materials. From this, it seems that it is entirely necessary to stipulate that agricultural products and other materials subject to state planned purchase and unified purchase are not allowed to enter the free market. At the same time, after the completion of the state's planned purchase and unified purchase tasks, farmers are not allowed to sell their retained materials in the free market and must sell them to state-designated purchasing stores. This regulation is also necessary. Otherwise, the state's planned purchase and unified purchase policies cannot be effectively implemented.

Does prohibiting materials subject to planned purchase and unified purchase from entering the free market mean that the economic life of the masses is being managed too strictly? We don't think so. When the state formulates plans for the purchase of important agricultural products, it has already calculated and balanced the resources and needs of the materials and made appropriate arrangements for the needs of the local people. Especially after agricultural cooperativization, the agricultural cooperatives can carry out internal adjustments, which will not affect the people's economic life. If some agricultural cooperatives and farmers want to sell their retained materials, they can still continue to sell them to state-designated purchasing stores, which will not affect the economic turnover of the agricultural cooperatives and farmers. Moreover, state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives also have the obligation to help the masses solve the problem of adjusting supplies. The regulation prohibiting this part of the material from entering the free market will not only not have an adverse impact on the normal economic life of the broad masses but, on the contrary, it is precisely because this part of the material is prohibited from entering the free market that the normal economic life of urban and rural people and the interests of the vast majority of the masses are guaranteed. The only ones truly affected are a small number of speculators, which is beneficial rather than harmful to the country and the people.

In addition to clearly defining the scope of the free market, state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives must also operate a certain quantity of materials allowed to enter the free market according to market needs. Some people believe that after the opening of the free market, producers and consumers meet directly, and free negotiation and free transactions are conducted. State-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives can reduce or no longer operate. Facts have proved that this idea and practice are wrong. It should be seen that the supply and demand situation and price changes in the free market are very large. Especially those seasonal commodities are prone to excessive market supply during the peak season, with prices falling sharply; while in the off-season, there is no supply in the market, and prices tend to rise accordingly, which has a very unfavorable impact on both producers and consumers. Therefore, for this type of commodity, state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives must also operate a certain quantity. Especially those materials that have a greater impact on the lives of the broad masses of people, the state needs to control more to maintain the needs between regions and seasons. Of course, attention should also be paid to preventing the bias of excessive restrictions on small native products.

In order to strengthen the state's leadership over the free market, it is also necessary to strengthen administrative management. People's committees at all levels should deal with acts that undermine the state's planned purchase and unified purchase policies, as well as other various speculative and illegal acts, regardless of whether they are committed by institutions, organizations, enterprises, or individuals, according to the seriousness of the circumstances. Turning a blind eye to speculative and illegal acts is a manifestation of right-leaning emotions and must be overcome.

The market issue is closely related to the lives of the broad masses of people. To truly implement the State Council's regulations, it is necessary to conduct extensive political and ideological education among the broad masses of people in accordance with the spirit of these regulations, so that the broad masses of people consciously abide by these regulations and wage a resolute struggle against speculative and illegal acts.

### 自由市场要严格管理

    自由市场要严格管理
    国务院发出了“关于由国家计划收购统（购）和统一收购的农产品和其他物资不准进入自由市场的规定”，这是国家继续保证重要农产品和其他物资在全国范围内实行合理分配的一项重要办法，各地必须认真执行。
    近十个月来，全国各地陆续开放了国家领导下的小土产品的自由市场，这对于活跃城乡物资交流，刺激农副业生产的发展，促进国营商业和供销合作社改善经营管理，都曾起了积极的推动作用，解决了小土产品市场的“小塞”问题。但是小土产品自由市场开放以后，由于事先没有划清自由市场的范围，加以国家对于统一收购的物资只规定收购一定的比例，其余部分允许在市场上出售。因而便有一部分计划收购和统一收购的物资流入了自由市场。此外市场管理工作又没有及时跟上，不少地方商贩乘机抢购套购，随便提高收购价格，进行投机违法的活动。以致影响了国家的收购工作，给国民经济带来了一些不利的影响。这些情况表明，国家对于自由市场必须加强领导。
    要加强国家对自由市场的领导和管理，首先必须划清自由市场的范围。国务院规定中指出：粮食、油料、棉花，全部由国家计划收购；烤烟、黄洋麻等二十二种重要的土产品、三十八种重要的中药材，供应出口的苹果和柑桔、若干产鱼区供应出口和大城市的水产品，废铜、废锡、废铅、废钢等，都由国家委托国营商业部门和供销合作社统一收购。上述两类物资都不开放自由市场。我们认为，只要严格地掌握上述规定的范围，就可以限制自由市场的消极作用。
    为什么计划收购和统一收购的物资不开放自由市场呢？因为这些物资都是关系国计民生的重要物资。而且由于我国农业经济落后，许多农产品生产增长赶不上消费增长的情况，在短期内还难以改变，国家对这些重要物资如果掌握不到必需的货源，势必会减少工业原料和出口的供应，其结果也就会降低工业化的速度，影响国民经济计划的实现，妨碍国家的建设事业。去年下半年以来，有些人为了追求暴利，有些企业、机关和团体为了少数人的利益，利用开放小土产品自由市场的机会，不顾国家的政策，在国家计划收购和统一收购任务完成以前，就非法地贩运和采购某些计划收购和统一收购的物资。加上其他方面的一些原因，就影响到国家计划收购和统一收购任务的完成。比如粮食，1956年到1957年度的产量比上一年度增加了5％，但是国家征购粮食的数量却下降了5％；油料，1956年到1957年度产量比上一年度增加了12％，但是国家统购的数量却下降了12％；棕片，1957年产量预计比1956年增加5％，但国家收购的数量预计比上年度要减少18％。其他重要物资的收购，也有类似的情况。由此看来，规定由国家计划收购、统一收购的农产品和其他物资不准进入自由市场，是完全必要的。同时在国家计划收购和统一收购任务完成以后，农民如果出卖自己留用的物资，也不准在自由市场出售，必须卖给国家指定的收购商店。这个规定也是必要的。不这样就不能有效地贯彻执行国家计划收购和统一收购的政策。
    不准计划收购和统一收购的物资进入自由市场，是否对于群众的经济生活管得过死了呢？我们认为不是的。国家在制定重要农产品收购计划的时候，已经对物资的资源和需要进行了计算和平衡，对当地人民的需要作了适当的安排。特别在农业合作化以后，农业社可以进行内部调剂的情况下，更是不会影响人民经济生活的。有些农业社和农民如果要出卖自己留用的物资，仍然可以继续卖给国家指定的收购商店，也不会影响农业社和农民的经济周转。而且国营商业和供销合作社还有义务帮助群众解决有无调剂的问题。不准这一部分物资进入自由市场的规定，对于广大群众的正常经济生活不但不会产生不良的影响，恰恰相反，正是由于禁止这一部分物资进入自由市场，才保证了城乡人民正常的经济生活，保证了绝大多数群众的利益。而真正受到影响的不过是少数投机分子，这对国家和人民来说是有利的而不是有害的。
    除了划清自由市场的范围以外，对于允许进入自由市场的物资，国营商业和供销合作社也必须根据市场需要，经营一定的数量。有人认为，自由市场开放以后，生产者和消费者直接见面了，自由议价、自由成交了，国营商业和供销合作社可以减少经营或者不再经营了。事实证明，这种想法和作法是错误的。应当看到，自由市场的供求情况和价格变化很大。尤其是那些带有季节性的商品，容易形成旺时上市过多，价格急剧下跌；而淡季市场又无货供应，价格也就往往随之上涨，对于生产者和消费者都发生很不利的影响。因此，对于这类商品，国营商业和供销合作社也要经营一定的数量。特别是那些对广大人民生活关系比较重大的物资，国家更需要多掌握一点，以保持地区间和季节间的需要。当然也要注意防止对于小土产品限制过严的偏向发生。
    为了加强国家对自由市场的领导，还必须加强行政管理工作。各地人民委员会对于破坏国家计划收购和统一收购政策的行为，以及其他各种投机违法的行为，不分机关、团体、企业和个人，都应当根据情节的轻重，分别予以处理。对投机违法行为放任不管，是一种右倾情绪的表现，必须加以克服。
    市场问题同广大人民的生活有密切的关系，要使国务院的规定真正能够贯彻执行，必须根据这个规定的精神向广大人民群众进行广泛的政治思想教育，使广大人民自觉地遵守这个规定，同投机违法的行为进行坚决的斗争。
