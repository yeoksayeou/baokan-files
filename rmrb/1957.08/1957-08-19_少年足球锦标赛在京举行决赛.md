Xinhua News Agency, August 18th: The second stage (finals) of the 1957 Sixteen-Unit National Junior Football Championship began today in Beijing. Six football teams, the top three from each of the two competition zones in the first stage, are participating in this competition for the national junior football championship.

Three matches were held today. The Tianjin team defeated the Changsha team by a score of 6-0. The Guangzhou team defeated the Yanbian team by a score of 2-1, and the Shanghai team defeated the Shenyang team by a score of 3-2. The Changsha team and the Yanbian team were the third-place finishers in the Hangzhou competition zone and the Changchun competition zone, respectively, during the first stage. According to the original competition rules, the third-place finishers would not participate in the finals. However, because these two teams demonstrated outstanding levels in the runner-up battle in their respective competition zones during the first stage, the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission decided to add these two junior football teams to the second stage finals to provide them with more opportunities for observation.

The second stage of the 1957 Sixteen-Unit National Junior Football Championship will be conducted using a single round-robin competition system. The remaining twelve matches will be held on August 20th, 22nd, and 26th.
