The Beijing University Branch of the China Democratic League, Law Department and History Department, recently held several joint meetings, inviting some teachers from the two departments to participate, to expose and criticize the reactionary words and deeds of rightist Wang Tieyai.

Wang Tieyai vilified Peking University as being completely dark, and falsely accused the Party and government leaders of Peking University of being "administrators," saying that the planning, inspection, and reporting systems in teaching work were specific manifestations of "administration." He emphasized that so-called "administration" was the root of bureaucracy in the school, and described Peking University, which usually had a strong academic atmosphere, as being "institutionalized" and "bureaucratic," clamoring to "eliminate officialdom and promote scholarship," and "resolutely fight against the leaders of Peking University."

Wang Tieyai's spearhead of attack against the Party was first directed at the Law Department where he worked. He said: "The leadership of the Party can only stop at the school level, and should not go down to the department level. The Party should not interfere in scientific research and teaching." He wantonly slandered the Party leader comrades of the Law Department, saying that "officialdom is very prevalent, the department director is the chief, and the teachers are subordinates, it is simply a yamen," demanding that the trade union "hold a meeting to put pressure on the leaders of the Law Department"; then he declared: "The two deputy directors of the Law Department are both Party members, which is unnecessary." At a Peking University League members' forum, he went even further and echoed Chu Anping's "Party's world" by saying: "Every position is arranged with one or several Party members in charge, which is the root of sectarianism."

Wang Tieyai also "fought" against the Party leadership at the school level. He believed that Peking University's "bureaucracy" and "administration" were manifested in "concentrating power in the hands of Vice President Jiang alone," saying that "Peking University used to be a one-chief system under Vice President Jiang, and now it is a responsibility system under Secretary Jiang, nothing has changed." At a forum held by the Democratic League, Wang Tieyai openly proposed abolishing the Party committee system. He said: "The school committee should be jointly supervised by the Party committee and the democratic parties." He also said: "I think it should be like the five lines proposed by some people in Tsinghua (referring to the Party, government, labor union, Communist Youth League, and democratic parties). If there is only one line (referring to the Party), problems will inevitably arise." On the one hand, he groundlessly said: "Chairman Mao has affirmed 'professors governing the school'," on the other hand, he drew a circle for the Party's leadership work in the school, saying that "the Party in the school can only manage detailed ideological education, and should not 'interfere' with teachers' teaching and scientific research, and should not use administrative systems and administrative methods to restrain them." Participants in the forum unanimously pointed out that the essence of his thinking was to abolish the school's Party committee system, change Peking University's socialist direction, and make it take the old capitalist road.

Wang Tieyai hated the people's political and legal work and political and legal education. He said: "The main problem in the political and legal circles at present is sectarianism. Judicial reform, departmental adjustments, and the improper arrangements for old legal scholars are all manifestations of sectarianism." He also said: "Regarding sectarianism, it is manifested in the wholesale rejection of the political and legal academic circles. The Party's policy towards intellectuals is unity, education, and transformation, but in the past two years it was not unity, but打击[attack/hit]; not transformation, but cancellation." He vilified the political and legal education departments, saying: "Renmin University is a stronghold of dogmatism, the Central School of Political Science and Law Cadres is the old hen of sectarianism, and the Peking University Law Department is the派出所[police substation] of sectarianism."

Wang Tieyai participated in the "Great Law School" plan of the rightist Qian Duansheng. According to Professor Gong Xiangrui's exposure, once this "Great Law School" plan was realized, Wang Tieyai would serve as a general affairs director under Qian Duansheng. Professor Chen Fangzhi and other comrades from the History Department exposed another plan of Wang Tieyai: Wang Tieyai wanted to use the International Relations History Teaching and Research Section of the Peking University History Department as a foundation, merge the relevant departments of the Foreign Affairs College, Renmin University, and the Institute of International Relations of the Academy of Sciences into Peking University, and establish a "Great International Relations Department," with himself as the director of the department, without the leadership of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This conspiracy plan was to usurp the Party's leadership in this area.

After Chu Anping's fallacy of "Party's world" was published, Wang Tieyai and Yang Renpian, a professor in the History Department of Peking University, discussed the issue of "coalition government" twice. Zhang Bojun also instructed Pu Xixiu to find "someone who is knowledgeable about politics, like Wang Tieyai" to write an article to demonstrate the "coalition government" from the perspective of the national system, and to defend the fallacy of "Party's world." Therefore, participants in the forum demanded that Wang Tieyai explain his relationship with the Zhang-Luo anti-Party alliance of rightists.

    王铁崖的反党阴谋破产
    本报讯　中国民主同盟北京大学支部法律系和历史系两个小组，最近联合召开多次会议，邀请两系部分教师参加，揭露和批判右派分子王铁崖的反动言行。
    王铁崖把北京大学丑化成漆黑一团，诬蔑北大的党政领导都是“行政主义”，说教学工作中的计划、检查和汇报等制度，就是“行政主义”的具体表现。他强调所谓“行政主义”就是学校里官僚主义的根源，把素常学术空气比较浓厚的北大说成是“机关化”、“衙门化”，叫嚣着要“肃清官风，发扬学风”，“要坚决的和北大的领导作斗争”。
    王铁崖向党进攻的矛头首先指向他所在的法律系。他说：“党的领导只能停留在校一级，不能下到系一级，党不应干涉科学研究和教学。”他放肆地污蔑了法律系的党员领导同志，说什么“官风很盛，系主任是首长，教员是下级，简直是衙门”，要求工会“召开大会向法律系领导施加压力”；然后又扬言：“法律系两个副主任都是党员，不必要”。他在北大盟员座谈会上更进一步和储安平的“党天下”异曲同调地说：“每个岗位上都安排一个或几个党员掌大权，这就是宗派主义的根源。”
    王铁崖也向校一级的党的领导“作了斗争”。他认为北大的“官僚主义”和“行政主义”表现在“把权集中在江副校长一人之手”，说什么“北大过去是江副校长一长制，现在是江书记负责制，没有什么改变”。在民盟召开的座谈会上，王铁崖公然提出取消党委制的主张。他说：“校委会应该由党委和民主党派共同来监督”。又说：“我认为应如清华某些人提出的五条线（指党、政、工、团和民主党派），若只一条线（指党），必生问题。”他一方面无中生有地说：“毛主席已肯定了‘教授治校’”，一方面又给党在学校的领导工作划定一个圈圈，说什么“党在学校里只能管细致的思想教育，而不应该去‘干涉’教员的教学与科学研究，不要用行政系统和行政方法来约束他们。”参加座谈会的人一致指出，他的思想实质就是要取消学校的党委制，改变北京大学的社会主义方向，使其走上资本主义的老路。
    王铁崖仇视人民的政法工作与政法教育事业。他说：“目前政法界的问题，主要是宗派主义。司法改革、院系调整、对旧法学人员没有妥当安排，都是宗派主义的表现。”又说：“关于宗派主义，它表现在对政法学界一棍子打死。党对知识分子的政策是团结、教育、改造，但前两年不是团结，而是打击；不是改造，而是取消。”他污蔑政法教育部门说：“人民大学是教条主义的大本营，中央政法干校是宗派主义的老母鸡，北大法律系是宗派主义的派出所”。
    王铁崖参与了右派分子钱端升的“大法学院”的方案。根据龚祥瑞教授的揭发，这个“大法学院”的方案一旦实现后，王铁崖将在钱端升手下当一名总务长。陈芳芝教授和历史系其他同志揭露了王铁崖的另一计划：王铁崖想以北大历史系国际关系史教研室为基础，把外交学院、人民大学及科学院国际关系研究所等有关部门，都合并到北大来，成立一个“大国际关系系”，由他自己做系主任，不要外交部领导。这个阴谋计划，就是想篡夺党在这方面的领导权。
    储安平“党天下”的谬论发表后，王铁崖和北大历史系教授杨人楩曾两次讨论“联合政府”的问题。章伯钧也指示浦熙修找“对政治有研究的人，像王铁崖”来写一篇文章，从国家体制的角度来论证“联合政府”，并为“党天下”的谬论辩护。因此参加座谈会的人，要求王铁崖交代他和章罗联盟右派分子的关系。
