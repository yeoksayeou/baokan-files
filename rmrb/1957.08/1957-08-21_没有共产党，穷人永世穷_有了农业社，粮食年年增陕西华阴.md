　　Without the Communist Party, the Poor Would Be Poor Forever
　　With Agricultural Cooperatives, Grain Production Increases Year After Year, Huayin, Shaanxi
　　Many agricultural cooperatives in Huayin County, Shaanxi Province, have a clearer understanding of the superiority of collectivization through accounting and comparison. In Miaoqian Cooperative, Guanbei Township, the grain production over the years is as follows: 1954, more than 280,000 jin, an average of 423 jin per person; 1955, more than 390,000 jin, an average of 455 jin per person; 1956, 500,000 jin, an average of 518 jin per person. This year's summer grain harvest exceeded any previous year, and the estimated total output including autumn crops can reach more than 550,000 jin, an average of 582 jin per person. After this calculation, farmers who used to complain about receiving little grain had nothing to say. Poor peasant Li Zifa said: "Looking back, my ancestors were grain-deficient households for generations. Since 1954, we have developed from having enough to eat to becoming surplus grain households. This is the superiority of collectivization!"
　　Feng Shuangcai, a member of the Communist Youth League in the Sino-Soviet Friendship Cooperative of Yaoning Township, complained some time ago that this year's grain retention standard was too low, saying dissatisfiedly: At this rate, each year will be worse than the last. After the cooperative launched a discussion, it helped him do the math. It turned out that Feng Shuangcai's family of eight used to have only seven fen of land and often struggled to make ends meet. During the land reform, he was allocated seven mu of land, and he became a surplus grain household after joining the elementary cooperative. In the past, he had no house to live in and often spent the night in dilapidated temples. This year, the cooperative helped him build two large tile-roofed houses. Each member of his family eats 245 jin of wheat, and he himself has become a night school teacher from an illiterate. When the cooperative members calculated to this point, they raised four questions to Feng Shuangcai: Would you have land to cultivate without liberation? Could you become a surplus grain household without joining the cooperative? Could you live in a tile-roofed house without the cooperative's help? Could you culturally turn yourself around without the Party's leadership? After thinking about it, Feng Shuangcai was moved to tears. He said: "Now I feel that the Party and Chairman Mao are even closer than my own parents!"

　　没有共产党，穷人永世穷
　　有了农业社，粮食年年增陕西华阴
    陕西省华阴县许多农业社通过算账对比，更清楚的看到合作化的优越性。观北乡庙前社，历年的粮食产量是：1954年二十八万多斤、每人平均四百二十三斤，1955年为三十九万多斤、每人平均四百五十五斤，1956年五十万斤、平均每人五百十八斤，今年夏粮实收超过了任何一年，加上秋田预计产量共可达到五十五万多斤、每人平均五百八十二斤。经过这一算，过去叫唤粮食分的少的农民都没话说了。贫农李自发说：“回想起来，我祖祖辈辈都是缺粮户，打1954年起，从够吃发展到成了余粮户，这就是合作化的优越性！”
    姚宁乡中苏友好社共青团员冯双才，前些时嫌今年留粮标准低，不满地说：照这样，一年反不如一年了。社里开展讨论以后，帮助他算了账。原来，冯双才全家八口人，过去只有七分地，吃这顿没那顿，土改时他分到了七亩地，入了初级社就成了余粮户；过去他没房住，常在破庙里过夜，今年社里帮助他盖了两间大瓦房，全家每人吃麦二百四十五斤，他自己还从文盲当上了夜校教师。社员们算到这里，给冯双才提出四个问题：不解放有没有地种？不入社能不能当余粮户？不是社里帮助能不能住瓦房？不是党的领导能不能在文化上翻身？冯双才一琢磨，感动的流泪了。他说：“现在我才感到党和毛主席比亲娘还亲！”
