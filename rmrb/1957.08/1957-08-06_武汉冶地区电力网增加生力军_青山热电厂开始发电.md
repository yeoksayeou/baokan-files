    Wuhan Metallurgical Area Power Grid Gains New Strength
    Qingshan Thermal Power Plant Begins Generating Electricity

    (Our Wuhan dispatch) At 9:45 AM on August 2nd, after a period of rapid operation, a powerful current from the 35,000-volt high-voltage line of Wuhan Qingshan Thermal Power Plant was sent into the Wuhan metallurgical area power grid. The newly built Wuhan Thermal Power Plant has begun generating electricity.

    The Wuhan Qingshan Thermal Power Plant is a key project aided by the Soviet Union using the latest technology to help our country with construction. It is currently the first large thermal power plant within the customs area. The machinery and equipment of this power plant are equipped with clever and precise automatic alarms, automatic regulators, and automatic temperature and pressure measuring devices. Once an accident occurs during production, they can automatically switch to backup equipment or automatically shut down. The high degree of mechanization and automation of the production process fundamentally eliminates the unsafe phenomena that easily occur in ordinary old power plants.

    This thermal power plant will supply the electricity needs of large factories such as Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex, Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant, and Hankou Meat United Processing Plant. It is the main force of the Wuhan metallurgical area power grid. This thermal power plant will also supply steam and hot water to the Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex.

    Construction of this thermal power plant began in November 1955, and the first phase of factory construction was completed in just over a year.

    武汉冶地区电力网增加生力军
    青山热电厂开始发电
    本报武汉电　2日上午九时四十五分，武汉青山热电厂的汽轮发电机经过快速运转以后，一股强大的电流从三万五千伏高压线送进了武汉冶地区的电力网。新建的武汉热电厂开始发电了。
    武汉青山热电厂是苏联采用最新技术帮助我国建设的一项重点工程，是目前关内的第一个大热电厂。这座电厂的机器设备上，安设有灵巧而精确的自动警报器、自动调节器和自动测温、测压等装置，生产中一旦发生事故，它们就能自行换上备用设备或自动停车。生产过程的高度机械化和自动化，从根本上消除了一般旧电厂中容易发生的不安全现象。
    这座热电厂将供应武汉钢铁联合企业、武汉重型机床厂、汉口肉类联合加工厂等大型工厂用电的需要。它是武汉冶地区电力网的主力。这个热电厂还要供应武汉钢铁联合企业以蒸汽和热水。
    这座热电厂从1955年11月开始建设，经过一年多的时间就完成了第一期厂房工程。
