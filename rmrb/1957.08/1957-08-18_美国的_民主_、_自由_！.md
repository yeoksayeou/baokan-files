America's "Democracy" and "Freedom"!

"How much foam can a bar of soap produce?"

Can you answer this question? Do you think this question is childish and ridiculously laughable? But it actually came from the mouth of an American voter registration official. They used this kind of question to "test" the "cultural and constitutional knowledge" of Black voters.

Racists in the American South have always made things difficult for Black voters, attempting to deprive millions of Black people in the South of their right to vote. The methods are varied. Linking the right to vote to a poll tax is one method. The poll tax system implemented in six southern states requires people to pay a tax before they can vote. The southern states are poorer, and Black people have less income, so the poll tax becomes a heavy burden, preventing many Black people from enjoying the right to vote.

According to a recent issue of "Time" magazine in late July, in 1956, some white registration officials in South Carolina and Alabama simply deprived many Black voters of their registration rights by claiming that the "registration book was not at hand" or that Black voters "misplaced their application forms." Racists also use a tactic of delay. Registration procedures that take only a few minutes for white voters can take an hour or more for Black people. Some places even explicitly stipulate that Black voters must be accompanied and vouched for by "a good white person" to register. In the American South, where racism is rampant, how easy is it to find a white official who considers someone a "good white person" to protect the rights of Black people!

But that's not all. States also require voters to pass so-called "cultural and constitutional knowledge" tests. Whether or not one passes is naturally determined by white officials. Failure to pass means no registration. In these so-called "tests," Black citizens have to answer many complicated and even absurd questions. For example, on what day did the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution come into effect, or on what day did Oklahoma become a state? Some places require Black people to recite certain vague parts of the state constitution and even "interpret" and clarify them! In North Carolina, where racism is relatively "mild," a story occurred in which a Black woman was deprived of her right to vote because she mispronounced a few words when talking about the constitution. From this, one can understand that questions like "how much foam can a bar of soap produce?" are not particularly strange.

Even if Black citizens are fortunate enough to register in the voter rolls, it does not mean that they have obtained the right to vote. Last year, racists in Cogita County, Louisiana, organized a so-called "Citizens' Council" to "protect and maintain our Southern historical social system (the system of racial oppression) by all legal means." They colluded with the county's registration officials to check the Black voter list. According to their requirements, the registration officials notified 3,500 Black voters to "verify their identity" in person within ten days. Many Black people did come, but the registrar said he was "very busy" and could only verify the identity of 50 people per day. It would take two months and ten days to "verify" the identity of 3,500 people! Their harassment of Black voters is so extreme!

Some Black people finally registered as voters, but they still could not go to vote. If they were farmers, they would not be able to find buyers for their agricultural products; if they were merchants, they would find no place to extend them credit. Or, government officials would very "concernedly" call them in to ask: "Are you unhappy here? Is there anything wrong here? If you feel unhappy, we may be able to arrange for you to leave here!" This is called "encouraging migration"!

These practices, though insidious, seem "polite" on the surface. Of course, there is no shortage of areas where Black voters are intimidated with violence. The Ku Klux Klan burn burning crosses (signals of persecution of Black people) in the night, shooting at and throwing bombs at Black people's homes are common occurrences. "Time" magazine admitted that in 1954, in Belzoni, Mississippi, a Black pastor was brutally murdered by racists because he refused to remove his name from the voter list and insisted on his constitutional rights.

Under this harassment and persecution, the electoral rights of Black people have been severely undermined. According to "Time" magazine's statistics on voter registration in the four southern states of the United States, the number of Black voters who can exercise their right to vote is minimal. In Mississippi, there are more than 497,000 eligible Black voters, but only 20,000 are actually registered. In Alabama, only 10% of eligible Black voters are actually registered, 31% in Louisiana, and 25% in Georgia. In some counties in these states, Black people are not allowed to participate in voter registration and voting at all.

Indeed, the Fifteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1870 clearly stipulates that the right of citizens to vote shall not be infringed upon because of race or skin color; but for more than eighty years, the amendment is just an amendment, and the persecution of Black people is still the persecution of Black people. This is the so-called "democracy" and "freedom" of the United States!

### 美国的“民主”、“自由”！

    美国的“民主”、“自由”！
    “一块肥皂能产生多少泡沫？”
    你能回答这个问题吗？你以为这个问题提得幼稚和荒唐可笑吗？可是它却实实在在出自美国选民登记官员之口。他们就是用这类问题“测验”黑人选民的“文化和宪法知识”的。
    美国南方的种族主义分子一向对黑人选民进行刁难，企图剥夺南部数百万黑人的选举权。办法是五花八门的。把选举权同人头税联系起来是办法之一。在美国南部六州实行的人头税制度，使得只有缴纳一笔税款的人才有投票权。而美国南部各州是较穷苦的地区，黑人的收入不多，因此人头税就成了一宗沉重的负担，使许多黑人不能享有投票权。
    据7月底的一期美国“时代”周刊指出，1956年，在南卡罗来纳州和亚拉巴马州的某些白人登记官员，竟以“登记册不在手边”或者黑人选民“把申请表格放错了地方”为辞，平白地剥夺了许多黑人选民的登记权。种族主义者还使用一种拖延术。白种选民只花几分钟时间就办完的登记手续，轮到黑人就得等个把钟头。有些地方还明文规定黑人选民必须有“一个好的白种人”陪伴和证明才能进行登记。在种族主义猖狂的美国南部，要找一个白种官员认为是“好的白种人”来保护黑人权利，这又谈何容易！
    事不止此，各州还规定选民要通过所谓“文化和宪法知识”的测验。而测验的及格与否自然都由白人官员决定。不及格就不得登记。在这种所谓“测验”中，黑人公民要回答许多繁琐的以至荒诞的问题。譬如，宪法第十修正案是那一天宣布生效的，俄克拉荷马是那一天成为一个州的之类。有些地方要黑人背诵出州宪法中某些含糊不清的部分，而且还要加以“解释”阐明！在种族主义较为“温和”的北卡罗来纳州发生了这样的故事：一个黑种妇人由于在谈宪法的时候有几个字的发音不正确，结果就被剥夺了选举资格。由此可以了解，像“一块肥皂能产生多少泡沫”之类的问题也算不得十分希奇古怪了。
    黑人公民即使侥幸在选民册上登记了，还不能算是获得了选民资格。去年路易斯安那州郭吉太县的种族主义分子组织了一个所谓“公民委员会”，要“用各种合法的办法保护和维护我们南方的历史社会制度（种族压迫制度）”。他们串通县的登记官员，检查黑人选民名单。按照他们的要求，登记官员通知三千五百个黑人选民要在十天之内当面“核证身份”。许多黑人果真来了，但登记官说“忙得很”，每天只能核证五十人。这样要把三千五百人“核证”完毕，就得花二个月零十天的工夫！其对黑种选民的刁难竟至如此！
    有一些黑人终于登记为选民了，但他们还是不能去投票。如果他们是农夫，他们的农产品就会找不到买主；如果是商人，他们就会发现无处向他们赊货。或者，政府官员就会十分“关心地”把他们叫去询问：“你在这里不愉快吗？这里有什么事情不对吗？要是你感到不愉快的话，我们也许可以为你安排离开这里！”名之曰：“鼓励迁移”！
    这些作法尽管刁恶，表面看来似乎还算“客气”。当然也不乏以暴力恐吓黑人选民的地区。三K党棍徒们在黑夜里燃烧火十字架（迫害黑人的信号），向黑人住宅射击和投掷炸弹等这类恐怖行动是屡见不鲜的。“时代”周刊供认，1954年在密士失必州的贝尔卓尼地方的一位黑人牧师，由于拒绝把名字从选民单上划掉而坚持应享的宪法权利，结果被种族主义分子残暴地杀害了。
    在这种种刁难迫害下，黑人的选举权利遭到了严重的破坏。根据“时代”周刊关于美国南部四州选民登记的统计，黑人选民能够执行投票权的真是微乎其微。在密士失必州，有资格的黑人选民四十九万七千余人，但实际登记的人数只有二万人。在亚拉巴马州，实际登记的黑人选民只占有资格的黑人选民的10％，路易斯安那州只占31％，佐治亚州只占25％。在这些州里的有些县份根本不允许黑人参加选民登记和投票。
    不错，早在1870年的美国宪法第十五修正案中已明文规定：公民的投票权利不得因种族和肤色而受侵害；但是八十多年来，修正案归修正案，迫害黑人还是迫害黑人。这就是美国的所谓“民主”和“自由”！
