    Nanjing Secondary Schools Struggle Deepens
    Middle-of-the-Road Elements Turn Left

    (Our dispatch) Nanjing City's more than seventy secondary schools, with over six thousand teachers and staff, are actively engaged in the anti-rightist struggle.

    Initially, some teachers lacked sufficient understanding of the great significance of the anti-rightist struggle, and some were afraid of it affecting their summer vacation, and therefore did not actively participate in the anti-rightist struggle. In the recent half-month, teachers' awareness has gradually increased, and more and more activists have participated in the struggle; many middle-of-the-road elements are also turning left. In order to refute the rightists from a theoretical and ideological standpoint, many teachers, disregarding the hot weather, even staying up late at night, collected materials and prepared speaking outlines. Due to the active exposure by the broad masses of teachers and staff, the ugly faces of the rightists have now been further exposed.

    At present, the struggle against rightist elements in Nanjing secondary schools is underway. (Xinhua News Agency Dispatch)

    南京中等学校斗争深入
    中间分子向左转
    本报讯　南京市七十多所中等学校的六千多名教职员工积极投入反右派斗争。
    开始，有些教师对反右派斗争的伟大意义认识不足，有的怕影响暑假生活，因而没有积极投入反右派斗争。在最近半个月中，教师们觉悟逐步提高，参加斗争的积极分子愈来愈多；很多中间分子也在向左转。为了从理论和思想上驳倒右派分子，许多教师不顾天气炎热，甚至深夜不眠，搜集材料，准备发言提纲。由于广大教职员工的积极揭发，右派分子的丑恶面目现在已进一步暴露出来。
    目前南京中等学校的右派分子斗争正在展开。　（新华社专稿）
