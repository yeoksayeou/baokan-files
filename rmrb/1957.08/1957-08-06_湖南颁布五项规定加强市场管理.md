Hunan Provincial People's Committee issued a public notice on August 1 concerning strengthening grain market management and banning grain speculation. The notice stated that recently, grain speculation activities have been discovered in various places, causing chaos in the grain market. Some private merchants sell grain or exchange goods with farmers for grain. Some farmers sell their rations or unified sales grain at high prices and then demand the state to provide supplementary sales. Individual agricultural cooperatives, under the pretext of developing sideline production, also engage in grain trading or grain processing. Even more, some lawbreakers alter, forge, buy, and sell unified sales grain certificates, revolving grain certificates, and grain coupons to obtain state grain for speculative activities. These are all illegal acts that directly undermine the state's policy of unified purchase and sale of grain and grain market management, and they are seriously detrimental to the stability of people's lives and the consolidation of agricultural cooperatives, and should be resolutely banned. The notice then put forward five provisions:

	I. From the time when new grain comes onto the market until the state announces the end of unified purchase, all grain transactions in rural areas shall be suspended. Farmers shall not conduct grain adjustments among themselves, and the sale of grain by agricultural cooperatives and farmers shall be handled by the state for unified purchase. After the unified purchase ends, the surplus grain of agricultural cooperatives and farmers can be freely stored, used, or sold to the state or traded in the state grain market, but grain speculation must be strictly prohibited, as well as opening mills, noodle shops, and distilleries to purchase grain raw materials for processing into finished products, brewing wine, and privately making cooked food for sale, or exchanging finished products for grain raw materials. All merchants engaged in grain business or exchanging goods for grain shall have all grain confiscated, and shall be fined or sentenced according to the severity of the circumstances. Agricultural cooperatives that process and transport grain for sale should give the main person in charge criticism and education, and those with serious circumstances should be punished and ordered to immediately cease operations. All grain raw materials and finished products operated by them shall be purchased by the state in a unified manner. Farmers who buy and sell grain at high prices should generally be persuaded to stop, and all their grain should be purchased at the unified purchase price. If they have consistently engaged in grain speculation and refuse to mend their ways after repeated education, in addition to confiscating all their grain, they should be given necessary sanctions according to the severity of the circumstances. Those who are short of grain due to selling grain will no longer be supplied by the state. Illegal acts of purchasing green seedlings from farmers should be resolutely banned and dealt with according to the specific circumstances.

	II. All acts of obtaining and hoarding grain through illegal means shall be strictly prohibited. Violators shall be given sanctions according to the specific circumstances. Criminals who forge or alter state unified sales grain certificates, revolving grain certificates, and grain coupons must be seriously investigated and dealt with according to the law. The main criminal elements who carry out these crimes collectively should be severely punished, and all illegally obtained grain and money should be confiscated and turned over to the public.

	III. Grain certificates and grain coupons issued by the state shall not be bought or sold. If the seller's household is removed from the unified sales system, the state will no longer supply grain. The grain certificates and grain coupons purchased by the buyer should be recovered, and if state grain has been obtained through illegal means, all of it should be recovered. Those who buy grain certificates and grain coupons for speculative activities should be severely punished.

	IV. State-owned, cooperative-operated, joint state-private enterprises, as well as staff members of state organs and agricultural cooperative cadres, should modelly abide by the state's grain policy. Those who use their positions to engage in grain speculation and undermine grain market management shall be severely punished in accordance with the law, without any leniency.

	V. State grain departments, whether during the period of unified grain purchase or after the end of unified purchase, should closely contact relevant departments, improve market management organizations, and strengthen the education of market management cadres, so as to manage market work well.

    湖南颁布五项规定加强市场管理
    本报讯　据新湖南报消息：湖南省人民委员会在8月1日发出了关于加强粮食市场管理、取缔粮食投机的布告。布告说，近来各地都发现了粮食投机活动，造成粮食市场混乱。有些私商贩卖粮食或以货物向农民兑换粮食。有的农民高价出卖口粮或统销粮，反过来又要求国家补销。个别的农业社借口开展副业生产，也从事粮食买卖或粮食加工。更有一些不法分子涂改、伪造、买卖统销粮证、周转粮证和粮票，套购国家粮食，进行投机活动。这些都是直接破坏国家粮食统购统销政策和粮食市场管理的非法行为，对人民生活的安定和农业社的巩固都是严重不利的，应该坚决予以取缔。布告接着提出了五项规定。
    一、自新粮上市到国家宣布统购结束为止的期间，农村粮食一律停止交易，农民间亦不得进行粮食调剂，农业社和农民出售粮食，统由国家收购。统购结束以后，农业社和农民的余粮，可以自由贮存、使用、或卖给国家或到国家粮食市场交易，但需严格禁止粮食投机，或开设磨坊、面坊、酒坊收购粮食原料加工成品、煮酒和私自制成熟食出售，或以成品兑换粮食原料。凡商贩从事粮食经营或以货物兑换粮食的，应没收全部粮食，并视情节轻重科以罚金或判刑。农业社加工粮食贩运的，应给予主要负责人批评教育，情节严重者应予处罚，并限令即刻停止经营，所有经营的粮食原料、成品由国家全部统购。农民之间高价买卖粮食的，一般应说服制止，按统购价格收购其全部粮食，如系一贯进行粮食投机屡教不改者，除没收其全部粮食外，并视情节轻重给以必要的制裁。因出卖粮食而缺粮的，国家不再供应。凡向农民购买青苗的非法行为，应坚决取缔，分别情况进行处理。
    二、严格禁止一切套购囤积粮食的行为，违者应分别情况给以处分。对伪造、涂改国家统销粮证、周转粮证、粮票的罪犯，必须依法严肃查究，集体进行的首要犯罪分子，应该从重处罚，并将全部套购粮食粮款没收归公。
    三、国家所发的粮证粮票，均不得进行买卖。如卖方系统销户，国家不再供应粮食。对买方应追回所买粮证、粮票，如已套购国家粮食应全部追回，若系收买粮证、粮票从事投机活动者，应从严处分。
    四、国营、合作社营、公私合营企业及国家机关工作人员和农业社干部，应模范地遵守国家粮食政策。如有利用职权进行粮食投机活动，破坏粮食市场管理的，一律依法加重惩处，决不姑宽。
    五、国家粮食部门，不论在粮食统购期间或统购结束以后，应密切与有关部门的联系，健全市场管理组织，加强市场管理干部的教育。把市场工作很好的管理起来。
