American Conspirators in the Middle East
By a commentator of this newspaper

Following the exposure of America's plot to subvert Syria, it is now making comprehensive deployments in the Middle East, preparing to launch a more vicious attack on Arab nationalism, especially on Syria. The frequent conspiratorial activities of Henderson, the so-called "senior expert" on Middle Eastern affairs at the U.S. State Department and Assistant Secretary of State, in Turkey are aimed at planning the next stage of aggression.

Henderson is a veteran of subversive activities at the U.S. State Department. He was the one who engaged in subversive activities in Iran in 1953; he was the one who went to Cairo with Australian Prime Minister Menzies to threaten Egypt after the Suez crisis; and he was the one who haggled with Britain over the Buraimi Oasis issue after the Anglo-American Bermuda Conference this year. This is a conspirator and executioner whose profession is to strangle Middle Eastern nationalism. After Henderson arrived in Turkey, he held frequent talks with the Kings of Jordan and Iraq, who had already arrived, and the representative of Lebanon, who had made a special trip. According to Western news reports, the United States, because it had to admit that the situation in Syria was purely an internal affair and could not find an excuse to directly interfere in Syria, attempted to bring together the Baghdad Pact countries and some pro-Western Arab countries to form a so-called "front" to surround Syria and interfere in Syria through them. According to the Associated Press, the United States wants to make "the Lebanese, Turks, Iraqis and Jordanians further intensify their encirclement of the Syrians" and "intensify political movements." In other words, the United States will direct Syria's neighbors to put pressure on Syria and continue to carry out subversive activities within Syria through these countries.

On the other hand, these subversive activities will be supplemented by military provocations. Turkey, which has been completely under American control since the war, has been chosen by the United States as a pawn for military intervention in Syria. These days, the American propaganda machine has spared no effort in publicizing Turkey's "concern" and "worry" about the Syrian situation, and the reactionary Turkish newspapers have also joined this chorus, saying that the Syrian situation "primarily involves Turkey," and clamoring that Turkey might "be forced to take measures that cannot be regarded as an act of aggression against Syria." Therefore, it is clear that the United States using Turkey to carry out military intervention in Syria, in coordination with subversive activities within Syria, in order to echo each other internally and externally to overthrow the Syrian government, this possibility exists. The American "Christian Science Monitor" straightforwardly wrote: One of the "next steps on Syria" is that "Turkey and Iraq, in consultation with Washington, may take confrontational military and economic measures." The so-called "economic measures" here clearly indicate that the United States will make an issue of the two oil pipelines passing through Syria from Iraq and Saudi Arabia, creating an excuse for intervention. The American "New York Herald Tribune" said it even more bluntly, demanding that Syria be "first encircled and then annihilated," and demanding that the American government "accomplish it in whatever way the situation requires."

The aggressive conspiracy currently being planned by the United States in the Middle East is not only aimed at Syria, but at the entire nationalist force in the Middle East. After visiting Turkey, Henderson will also visit other Arab countries. According to the U.S. State Department, the Baghdad Pact "Anti-Subversion Committee," which aims to suppress nationalist forces in Middle Eastern countries, will hold a meeting in late September. And this meeting will take Henderson's "report" as a guide for action. At the same time, there are reports that King Hussein of Jordan will go to Spain after meeting with Henderson. For a long time, the United States has been planning to use Spain as its core, roping in some North African countries to piece together an aggressive "Mediterranean Alliance" to isolate Egypt. Hussein's sudden visit to Spain at this time is clearly related to this American plan.

With the United States actively planning to launch an attack on nationalist forces in the Middle East, it is even more necessary for the Arab people to unite closely, deal with foreign aggression together, and smash the imperialist aggressive conspiracy. Three days ago, when Syrian President Kuwatly returned to Damascus from Cairo, he emphasized that Egypt and Syria would unite to resist the pressure imposed by imperialism. This is a strong response to the American aggression group, and it is also an important guarantee for them to achieve a common victory against colonialism.

    美国阴谋家在中东
    本报评论员
    美国在颠覆叙利亚的阴谋败露以后，目前正在中东进行全面部署，准备对阿拉伯民族主义、首先是对叙利亚发动更凶恶的进攻。美国国务院的所谓中东事务的“高级专家”、副国务卿帮办汉德逊在土耳其进行的频繁的阴谋活动，就是在为下一步的侵略行动进行策划。
    汉德逊是美国国务院搞颠覆活动的老手。1953年在伊朗搞颠覆活动的是他；苏伊士危机发生后，同澳大利亚总理孟席斯一道到开罗去威胁埃及的是他；在今年英美百慕大会议以后，同英国就布赖米绿洲问题讨价还价的也是他。这是一个以扼杀中东民族主义为职业的阴谋家和刽子手。汉德逊到达土耳其以后，就同先已到达的约旦、伊拉克的国王和特地赶去的黎巴嫩的代表进行频繁的会谈。根据西方新闻界所透露的消息，美国由于不得不承认叙利亚的局势纯粹是内政问题，无法找到对叙利亚进行直接干涉的借口，因此企图撮合巴格达集团国家和一些亲西方的阿拉伯国家，组成包围叙利亚的所谓“阵线”，假它们之手来干涉叙利亚。按照美联社的说法，美国要使“黎巴嫩人、土耳其人、伊拉克人和约旦人将更进一步地加紧对叙利亚人的包围”，并“加紧政治运动”。换句话说，美国将指使叙利亚的邻国对叙利亚施加压力，并通过这些国家继续在叙利亚内部进行颠覆活动。
    另一方面，这种颠覆活动将辅之以军事上的挑衅。战后已经完全落入美国控制的土耳其，已被美国选择作为对叙利亚进行军事干涉的爪牙。这些天来，美国宣传机器不遗余力地宣传土耳其对叙利亚局势的“关切”、“担心”，而土耳其的反动报纸也参加了这个合唱，说什么叙利亚局势“首先牵涉到土耳其”，并且叫嚷土耳其可能“被迫采取的措施不能被认为是对叙利亚的侵略姿态”。因此，很明显，美国利用土耳其对叙利亚进行军事干涉，配合叙利亚国内的颠覆活动，以便内外呼应，推翻叙利亚政府，这种可能性是存在的。美国“基督教科学箴言报”直捷了当地写道：“对叙利亚的下一步骤”之一，就是“土耳其和伊拉克在同华盛顿协商下，可能采取对抗的军事和经济措施”。这里的所谓“经济措施”，显然说明美国将在从伊拉克和沙特阿拉伯经过叙利亚的两条油管上做文章，制造进行干涉的借口。而美国“纽约先驱论坛报”说得更露骨，它要求把叙利亚“首先加以包围，然后消灭它”，并且要求美国政府“以形势所要求的不管什么方式来加以完成”。
    美国目前在中东策划的侵略阴谋，不仅针对着叙利亚，而且针对着整个中东的民族主义力量的。汉德逊在访问土耳其以后，还将访问其他阿拉伯国家。据美国国务院透露，以镇压中东各国的民族主义力量为目的的巴格达条约“反颠覆委员会”，将要在9月下旬召开会议。而这个会议将要按照汉德逊的“报告”作为行动方针。同时，有消息说，约旦国王侯赛因在与汉德逊会谈之后，将去西班牙。很久以来，美国就在策划以西班牙为核心，拉拢一些北非国家拼凑“地中海联盟”的侵略集团，以孤立埃及。侯赛因在这个时候突然去西班牙，显然同美国的这一策划有关。
    在美国积极策划对中东民族主义力量实行进攻的情况下，阿拉伯人民就更有必要紧密地团结起来，一致对付外侮，以粉碎帝国主义的侵略阴谋。前三天，叙利亚总统库阿特利从开罗回到大马士革时曾强调说，埃叙两国将团结一致，抗击帝国主义施加的压力，这是对美国侵略集团的一个有力的答复，也是它们取得反对殖民主义的共同胜利的一项重要保证。
