The Wonderful Hand of a Picture Mounter
By Our Correspondent Hu Daoyuan

At an exhibition held by the Shanghai Museum in 1954, a valuable ancient painting, "The Lofty Scholars" by Sun Wei, attracted many visitors. Sun Wei was a famous painter of the Tang Dynasty, and no second piece of his work can be found in the country. This only surviving treasure, said to be over a thousand years old, still has brilliant colors and a complete image, without even the slightest damage to the silk and upper and lower rollers used in the mounting. Many viewers wondered: How could it be preserved so well?

In fact, this precious ancient painting had long been so dilapidated that it was impossible to handle. The entire painting was full of holes, some as large as copper coins, others as small as ant nests, and some areas were practically spiderwebs. When the guide mentioned this, curious viewers examined the painting carefully but couldn't find any traces of patching. This led to a new question: Which skilled mounter restored it?

This master craftsman is Zhou Guisheng of the Shanghai Mounting Production Cooperative. I met this artisan at the National Congress of Arts and Crafts Representatives.

He is already fifty-six years old. He has been engaged in this craft for forty-one years. He worked for more than ten years in the home of a famous collector in Nanxun, where he studied many ancient and modern paintings and calligraphy, understood the spirit of the works of art from different dynasties. Also, because he loves his profession, he has become one of the leading picture mounters in China.

Ancient paintings cannot be mounted with modern paper, because the thickness, coarseness, gloss, intensity of light, and the presence or absence of patterns, as well as the width of the patterns, are all different in each dynasty. Take the patterns as an example: those of the Song Dynasty were as wide as three fingers, those of the Yuan Dynasty more than an inch, those of the Ming Dynasty eight tenths of an inch, those of the Qing Dynasty six tenths, and those of today only four tenths. If you use paper with patterns only four tenths of an inch wide to patch an ancient painting with patterns three fingers wide, wouldn't the patch be obvious at a glance? Therefore, paintings from a certain dynasty must be repaired with paper from the same dynasty. So, where did the paper for mounting that Tang Dynasty painting come from? It turned out that Zhou Guisheng usually took care to collect old papers from the past, even if it was only a small piece or fragment, he would keep it as a treasure. Now, in Zhou Guisheng's boxes are Xuan paper from the Northern Song Dynasty, plain silk from the Ming Dynasty, and all kinds of broken papers and old silks. But since it was impossible to find Tang Dynasty paper to mount that painting, he used the top and bottom edges of a Ming Dynasty painting scroll with similar paper patterns as raw materials, and with his skillful hands, he finally succeeded in repairing it.

Even though the paper patterns were the same, patching is still patching. How could he make it so that even experts couldn't see the patches? That is Zhou Guisheng's true skill. When patching a painting, he first uses a small knife to flatten both sides of the tear and the patching paper. When he holds it up to the sunlight and can't see the patch, he proceeds with the repair. After the patching paper is dry, he scrapes the front again, and he doesn't let go until he has scraped each patch four times.

Repairing the tear is not enough, because even if the paper is from the same dynasty, the colors will still be different. Zhou Guisheng mixes various pigments to match the color of the painting paper, and then paints the patched areas one brushstroke at a time. He not only has to paint it so that the new and old colors cannot be distinguished from the front, but also so that they cannot be distinguished from the back. If the painting is damaged, he has to repaint it according to the original brushstrokes, style, and color.

Zhou Guisheng worked meticulously in this way, spending nearly five months to repair that dilapidated Tang Dynasty painting completely. Many ancient paintings in the Shanghai Museum have been mounted by him. (Image attached)

    裱画妙手
    本报记者　胡道源
    1954年上海博物馆举办的一次展览会上，有一幅名贵的古画——孙位高逸图，吸引了许多观众。孙位是唐代有名的画家，他的作品在国内已经找不到第二件了。这件仅存的珍品，相传已经一千多年，可是画色精采，画面完整，连裱画的绢和上下轴子都没有一点损伤。许多观众惊奇地问：怎么能够保存得这样好呢？
    其实，这幅名贵的古画，早就破烂得拿不上手了，满画都是洞眼，大的像铜钱一样，小的和蚁穴一般，有些地方简直成了蜘蛛网。好奇的观众听见讲解员说到这里的时候，仔细看看画面，一点补缀的痕迹都找不出来，于是又产生了新的问题：是哪一位裱画能手裱的？
    这位能手就是上海市装裱生产合作社的周桂生。在全国工艺美术艺人代表会议上，我见到了这位艺人。
    他已经五十六岁了。他从事这门手艺已经四十一年，早年在南浔一个有名收藏家那里工作过十来年，博览过许多古今字画，领会了历朝字画的神韵；加上他热爱自己的职业，现在已经成为我国首屈一指的裱画能手了。
    裱古画不能用现代的纸，因为纸的厚薄、粗细、有光无光、光强光弱、有无纹路、纹路的宽窄，各个朝代都是不相同的。就拿纹路来说，宋代的有三个指头宽，元代的一寸多，明代的八分，清代的六分，现在的只有四分了。拿纹路只有四分宽的纸去补有三个指头宽的古画，不是一眼就可以看出补绽来吗？因此，什么朝代的画，就要补什么朝代的纸。那么，裱那张唐代古画的纸又是从那儿找来的呢？原来周桂生平时留心收罗古代旧纸，那怕是一小块、一小片，也要当作财宝留下来。现在周桂生的箱子里有北宋的宣纸、明代的素缎和各色各样的破纸旧绢。可是裱那张画，要找唐代的纸是不可能的，他就用一张纸纹相近的明代画卷的上下边来做原料，在他的妙手之下，终于补成功了。
    纸的纹路虽然相同，但是补的总是补的，怎样能够使行家也看不出补纹来呢？这就是周桂生的真功夫。他补画的时候，首先要把破口和补上的纸两面都用小刀刮平，托上去朝阳光一照，看不出补纹来才动手补，等到补的纸干了，正面还要刮一刮，一个补口要刮四次才放手。
    破口补好了还不算，因为虽说是一个朝代的纸，颜色也有新旧，周桂生就用各种颜料配成画纸一样的颜色，一笔一笔地在补接的地方涂，不仅要涂得从正面看分不出新旧，还要涂得从反面看也分不出新旧才行。画破了的，还得根据原来的笔意、风格、色泽去画。
    周桂生就是这样精工细作，花了近五个月的功夫，把那张破烂不堪的唐代名画补得完整无缺了。上海博物馆的许多古代名画，都是经过他装裱过的。（附图片）
