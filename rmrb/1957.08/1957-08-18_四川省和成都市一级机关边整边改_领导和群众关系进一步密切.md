Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, August 17th. First-level organs in Sichuan Province and Chengdu City, in accordance with the spirit of rectifying while correcting, are actively improving their work, further strengthening the relationship between leaders and the masses.

Currently, leaders of various organs have generally gone deep into grassroots levels and work sites to understand the situation and solve problems. Many organs have also established systems for leaders to go deep into the grassroots and implement them. The Sichuan Provincial Department of Industry stipulated that half a day each week be designated as a "No-Meeting Day," as a time for department and bureau directors to specifically meet with the masses or go deep into the grassroots. The Sichuan Provincial and Chengdu Municipal Bureaus of Culture also stipulated that every Friday be a "Friendship Day," during which relevant leaders meet and talk with artists from opera, ballad singing, and other fields, resolving some of the difficulties and problems they raise. The director and deputy director of the Chengdu Municipal Public Utilities Bureau have, in the past month, repeatedly gone deep into the streets and alleys to visit residents, and based on the residents' opinions, urged relevant units to newly establish nine tap water sales stations and install seventy-nine street lights, which residents greatly appreciated.

Cadres above the level of section chief in provincial and municipal-level organs have also formed hundreds of work teams, which have gone to factories, mines, farms, and agricultural cooperatives to understand the difficulties and problems in their work, and to help leading organs improve their work in a timely manner. Dozens of work teams dispatched by the Sichuan Provincial Department of Agriculture, Department of Forestry, Department of Water Resources, and Meteorological Bureau have helped many grassroots units solve more than one hundred problems that had not been resolved for a long time.

All organs have further strengthened the handling of letters and visits from the people.

    四川省和成都市一级机关边整边改
    领导和群众关系进一步密切
    新华社成都17日电  四川省和成都市一级机关，根据边整边改精神，积极改进工作，进一步密切领导和群众的关系。
    现在，各机关的领导人已普遍深入基层和现场了解情况，解决问题。许多机关还把领导深入基层订成制度加以实行。四川省工业厅规定每周抽出半天时间为“无会议日”，作为厅、局长们专门接见群众或深入基层的时间。四川省和成都市文化局还规定每星期五为“联谊日”，由有关领导人与戏曲、曲艺等方面的艺人见面、谈心，解决他们提出的一些困难和问题。成都市公用事业管理局的正副局长，在最近一个月内，曾几次深入街巷访问居民，并根据居民们的意见，督促有关单位新设了九个自来水售水站和安装了七十九盏路灯，居民们深感满意。
    省、市级机关的处长和科长以上干部还组成了上百个工作组，分别到工厂、矿山、农场、农业社去了解工作中的困难和问题，帮助领导机关及时改进工作。四川省农业厅、林业厅、水利厅和气象局等单位派出的数十个工作组，就曾帮助许多基层单位解决了一百多个长期没有解决的问题。
    各机关都进一步加强了对人民来信和来访的处理工作。
