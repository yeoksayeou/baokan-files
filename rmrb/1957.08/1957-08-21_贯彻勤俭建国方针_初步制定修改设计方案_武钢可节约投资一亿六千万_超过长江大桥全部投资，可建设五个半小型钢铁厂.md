This newspaper's Wuhan dispatch on the 20th. Reporter Cao Baoming reports: In order to implement the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift, the Wuhan Iron and Steel United Enterprise has initially formulated a revised design plan, saving the state more than 160.7 million yuan in construction funds. This money is more than the entire investment of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge and could be used to build five and a half small steel plants, which could increase production by approximately 825,000 tons of pig iron and 550,000 tons of steel annually.

The Wuhan Iron and Steel United Enterprise has revised a total of 955 engineering projects this time. Among them, the industrial port designed according to the second-phase project scale will be postponed because the utilization rate is not high in the first-phase project, and the transportation problem can be solved by other methods, which can save more than 40 million yuan. The originally designed large oxygen station has also been decided to be postponed, saving more than 10 million yuan. This is the first category. The second category is to change the building structure, that is, to change the steel structure to reinforced concrete structure, to reduce the span of beams and columns, etc., saving 30 million yuan. The third category is to change foreign orders to domestic manufacturing. For example, if a certain rolling mill is changed to a domestic order, it will save 10 million yuan. The fourth category is to reduce the degree of mechanization of auxiliary facilities. For example, the original design of the steelmaking plant used high-pressure water to clean the ingot molds, but now it is decided to change to manual cleaning, which has no direct impact on steelmaking. Many modifications have also been made to maintenance equipment and transportation equipment, and the number of spare parts has been reduced; the design standards for heating have also been lowered. The preliminary revised design plan is based on not moving the backbone of the main workshop and maintaining the original design's product quantity, quality, and advanced technical level, and ensuring the construction progress.

From the end of June, the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, the Wuhan Branch of the Black Metallurgy Design Institute, and the Wuhan Metallurgical Construction Corporation, led by Li Yiqing, the general manager and general Party committee secretary, and invited more than 100 designers from Beijing and Anshan and production personnel from Anshan to form a central group and 21 professional groups to review the design. The Design Institute first proposed 1,010 modification projects, and everyone conducted repeated discussions based on foreign design theories and domestic actual production conditions. Personnel familiar with one aspect of design, production, and construction expressed their opinions and weighed the pros and cons to determine.

Currently, there are still 15 projects of Wuhan Iron and Steel United Enterprise that are being revised because there is insufficient understanding of the situation and insufficient arguments from all parties, and data is still being collected for research. In addition, there are 35 projects that are being revised, but due to inconsistent opinions, we are requesting instructions from higher-level leading agencies and striving to finalize them in the near future.

    贯彻勤俭建国方针　初步制定修改设计方案
　　武钢可节约投资一亿六千万
　　超过长江大桥全部投资，可建设五个半小型钢铁厂
    本报武汉20日电　记者曹葆铭报道：为了贯彻执行勤俭建国的方针，武汉钢铁联合企业初步制定了修改设计的方案，为国家节约了一亿六千七百多万元的建设资金。这笔钱比武汉长江大桥的全部投资还多，可用来建设五个半小型钢铁厂，每年约可增产八十二万五千吨生铁和五十五万吨钢。
    武汉钢铁联合企业这次一共修改了九百五十五个工程项目。其中按照第二期工程规模设计的工业港，因为在第一期工程中利用率不高，而运输问题又可用别的办法解决，现在决定缓建，可节约四千多万元。原设计的大氧气站也决定缓建，可节约一千多万元，这是第一类。第二类是改变建筑结构，即将钢结构改为钢筋混凝土结构，将梁柱跨度改小等，节约三千万元。第三类是将国外订货改为国内制造，如某种轧钢机改为国内订货，就节约一千万元。第四类是降低辅助设施的机械化程度，如炼钢厂原设计用高压水力清洗钢锭模，现在决定改为人工清洗，对炼钢并无直接影响。对检修设备、运输设备，也作了很多修改，并减少备品数量；采暖的设计标准也降低了。初步修改设计的方案，是在主体车间的骨干部分不动和保持原设计的产品数量、质量以及先进技术水平，并保证施工进度的基础上制定的。
    从6月底起，武汉钢铁公司、黑色冶金设计院武汉分院和武汉冶金建筑总公司，即以总经理兼总党委书记李一清为首，并邀请北京、鞍山的设计人员和鞍山的生产人员一百多人，组成了一个中心组和二十一个专业组，对设计进行审查。设计院首先提出了一千零一十个修改项目，大家即根据国外设计的理论和国内实际生产情况，进行了反复的讨论。熟悉一个方面的设计、生产和施工人员，都各抒己见，再权衡利弊，加以确定。
    现在，武汉钢铁联合企业还有十五个项目的修改，因为了解情况不够，各方论据不足，正在继续搜集资料，进行研究。另外有三十五个项目的修改，由于大家意见不一致，正在向上级领导机关请示，争取在最近确定下来。
