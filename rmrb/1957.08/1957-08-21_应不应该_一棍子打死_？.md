Should We "Smash Them With One Blow"?
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Xing Huan

　　When rightists feign honesty, make "self-criticisms," and even weep bitterly to show "repentance," some "kind-hearted" people are deceived by these self-criticisms and tears. They say: Let's call it quits, no more struggle, don't "smash them with one blow."

　　These comrades are too naive. Rightists are not people who have accidentally made certain mistakes; they are reactionary elements who hate socialism to the core. Their goal is to overthrow the Communist Party, overthrow the state power of the people's democratic dictatorship, and overthrow the socialist system. They will not be reconciled until they achieve their goal. Their stance is unusually firm and unambiguous. Wang Wenguang, a "general" of the Zhang-Luo alliance in Taiyuan, didn't he openly shout that he was "willing to die on the side of the bourgeoisie"?

　　The tactic of false self-criticism adopted by rightists is aimed at getting through this "hurdle" so that they can wait for the anti-rightist struggle to pass and then seize the opportunity to make a comeback and stage a resurgence. If you don't believe it, there is evidence to prove it.

　　Li Baifeng, a rightist in Henan Province, wrote a letter to his friend five years ago, full of hatred, after his so-called "Study of Soviet Literature" was criticized, saying: "I am a wolf, not afraid of bloodshed, and I will demand a price in the future." "I will settle accounts with some people in three or five years." Sure enough, this spring, when the sky was once filled with dark clouds, Li Baifeng believed that the time to "demand a price" had come, so he bared his fangs and claws and counterattacked the people. He incited students at Kaifeng Normal College to make "great democracy," threatened the president to quickly "behead Ma Su," spread poison everywhere in many newspapers and periodicals outside the school, and even personally went to the Henan Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles to start a fire.

　　This spring, the poisonous weed "Grass and Trees" by Sichuan Province rightist Liu Shahe was criticized. At that time, this reactionary clique headed by Shi Tianhe secretly plotted to use various despicable means to counterattack the Party. After the counterattack failed, Liu Shahe shouted madly: "I will do it again the day after tomorrow (meaning in the future)." Under the righteous counterattack of the masses, the reactionary arrogance of this group of rightists superficially subsided, but, as Xu Hang, another rightist of this anti-Party clique, said: "Silence is not depression, silence is ammunition being loaded into the barrel and chamber." Sure enough, in May of this year, this group of rightists launched another attack on the Party after "loading up with ammunition," releasing their so-called "atomic bomb." This counterattack was also crushed. People may think: This time Liu Shahe and others should surrender to the people, right? Don't be so optimistic. Shi Tianhe, the head of this anti-Party clique, is making new deployments. He instructed Liu Shahe: "The struggle must continue... I hope you remain optimistic... Don't completely take a retreating attitude."

　　The "wolf" heart of the rightists outside the Party is not dead, and the rightists within the Party are no different. Zhong Dianfei, who first sounded the battle drum to the Party with "The Gongs and Drums of Film," although his rightist face has long been exposed and the anti-Party drums have been broken, still refuses to surrender, instructing his henchman Zhou Wenbo to cast a large net in the film industry before returning from Shanghai to Beijing, in order to launch a major attack on the Party.

　　Alright, alright, things are clear enough. The rightists are doing everything possible, even "unswervingly," to "smash" socialism and the Communist Party "with one blow." When their first blow fails, they will strike a second, third, fourth blow... In short, they will "smash to death" socialism, the Communist Party, and the people's world. For such reactionary and thoroughly evil people, can we still be gentle with them and "not smash them with one blow"? They have openly told us: "I am a wolf," and have already revealed their man-eating teeth. Are we still going to be "kind-hearted" Mr. Dong Guo? If you don't want to be eaten by the wolf, you have to smash it to death with one blow. This is the last resort that Mr. Dong Guo used to deal with the wolf. There is no other way.

　　However, let's be clear, the "smash them with one blow" that we are talking about is different from the rightists' "kill the Communists." We only want to thoroughly, completely, and cleanly expose and criticize the rightists' reactionary words and actions, so that they are exposed in their true colors before the people and can no longer confuse and harm people. That is to say, we want to "smash them with one blow" politically and ideologically, so that they can no longer make trouble.

　　应不应该“一棍子打死”？
　　星环
    当右派分子伪装老实，作出“检讨”，甚至痛哭流涕以示“忏悔”的时候，有些“好心肠”的人就被这种检讨和眼泪蒙蔽住了，他们说：算了，不要再斗争了，不要“一棍子打死”。
    这些同志太天真了。右派分子并不是偶然犯了某些错误的人，他们是从骨子里仇视社会主义的反动分子。他们的目的就是要推翻共产党，推翻人民民主专政的国家政权，推翻社会主义制度，他们不达目的，死不甘心。他们的立场异常坚定，毫不模糊。章罗联盟在太原的“大将”王文光，不是就毫不隐讳地叫出他“甘心死在资产阶级的立场上”吗？
    右派分子采取假检讨的战术，目的就是想混过这一“关”，等到反右派的斗争过去了，再窥伺时机卷土重来，东山再起。如若不信，有事实为证。
    河南省的右派分子李白凤，五年以前在他的所谓“苏联文学研究”一书受到批判后，曾满怀仇恨地写信给他的朋友说：“我是狼，不怕流血，将来索代价”。“要算有些人的账，三、五年后再说。”果然，今年春天，当天空一度黑云翻滚的时候，李白凤认为“索代价”的时机到了，就张牙舞爪地向人民反扑过来。他在开封师范学院鼓动学生闹“大民主”，要挟院长快“斩马?”，在学校外面的许多报纸刊物上到处放毒，还亲自到河南省文联去点火。
    今年春天，四川省的右派分子流沙河的毒草“草木篇”受到了批判。当时，这个以石天河为首的反动小集团，就密谋采取各种卑劣的手段，向党进行反扑。反扑失败以后，流沙河疯狂地叫嚣：“老子二天（即以后的意思）还要干。”在群众正义的反击下，这伙右派分子的反动气焰表面上是降下去了，但是，正如这个反党小集团的另一右派分子徐航所说的：“缄默并非消沉，缄默是弹药正在装进炮膛和枪膛。”果然到今年5月，这伙右派分子在“装满了弹药”之后向党进行了又一次攻击，放出了他们的所谓“原子弹”。这次反扑，又被粉碎了。人们也许会想：这次流沙河等人该要向人民投降了吧？且慢乐观。这个反党小集团的头子石天河，又在作新的部署了。他指示流沙河：“斗争是必须继续的……希望你保持乐观……不要完全采取退出的态度。”
    党外的右派分子“狼”心不死，党内的右派分子又何尝不是如此。以“电影的锣鼓”首先向党敲起战鼓的锺惦棐，虽然右派面目早已暴露，反党锣鼓也已敲破，但仍然拒不投降，指示他的党羽周文博，要他在由上海回北京之前，必须在电影方面撒下一个大网，以便大举向党进攻。
    好了，好了，事情已经够清楚了。右派分子是千方百计、甚至可说是“百折不挠”地想把社会主义、把共产党“一棍子打死”的。当他们的第一棍没有打成功之后，他们还要打第二棍、第三棍、第四棍……总之，要把社会主义、把共产党、把人民的天下“打死”为止。对于这样一些反动彻骨的人，难道我们还能够对他们温情脉脉而“不一棍子打死”吗？他们已经公开告诉我们：“我是狼”，而且已经露出了吃人的牙齿，我们难道还要做“好心肠”的东郭先生吗？如果不想被狼吃掉，就得一棍子打死它。这是东郭先生最后对付狼的办法，除此以外，别无其他办法。
    不过，话要说清楚，我们所说的“一棍子打死”，和右派分子所说的“杀共产党人”不同。我们只不过是要彻底、全部、干净地揭露、批判右派分子的反动言论和行动，让他们在人民面前原形毕露，不能再迷惑人、祸害人。也就是说，要从政治上、思想上把他们“一棍子打死”，打得他们再也不能兴妖作怪。
