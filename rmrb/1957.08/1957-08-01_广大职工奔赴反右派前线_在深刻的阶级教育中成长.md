Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 31st. The broad masses of workers in factories and mines in Jilin Province have received profound class education in the struggle against bourgeois rightists.

In the past two months, workers' rallies of thousands and tens of thousands of people have been held in industrial cities such as Changchun, Jilin, Siping, Liaoyuan, Tonghua, and Yanji, resolutely and forcefully repelling the frantic attacks of bourgeois rightists on the Communist Party and socialism. The first batch of workers in some large factories and mines undergoing rectification also launched face-to-face reasoning struggles with the bourgeois rightists who appeared in their units. At the same time, Party committees at all levels conducted large-scale anti-rightist class education for the broad masses of workers in factories and mines that had not yet launched rectification. Responsible cadres of various factories and mines also collected the erroneous statements of bourgeois rightists inside and outside the factory to report to the workers, thereby explaining the serious political significance of repelling the rightists and defending socialism. The masses of workers were educated extensively, with approximately 150,000 people in Changchun alone listening to one or two reports.

After listening to the reports, workers in various factories and mines held various symposiums, discussion meetings, and workers' representative meetings, which were the main forms adopted for this class education.

The anti-rightist struggle not only enabled the masses of workers to further draw clear lines, distinguish between ourselves and the enemy, and improve their class vigilance, but also criticized some personal plans and became a driving force for promoting the in-depth development of the increase production and practice economy movement. Factories and enterprises in Changchun City launched a warm "offer suggestions and plans" movement. From late June to now, according to statistics from six units, including the State-owned Rubber No. 8 Factory and Xinhua Printing Factory, workers have contributed 766 "suggestions" and "plans," solving many production problems. In previous years, the hot summer months of June, July, and August affected the production of paper mills, causing accidents, quality fluctuations, and failure to complete plans, which had almost become the norm. This year, workers at the Jilin Paper Mill received a series of class education in the anti-rightist struggle, further strengthening their sense of responsibility for production, ensuring normal production, achieving safe production, and overfulfilling their tasks. According to statistics for the first twenty days of July alone, 175 tons of paper were overproduced.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 31st. Chongqing's factories and mining enterprises are conducting universal and in-depth socialist education for the broad masses of workers through the anti-bourgeois rightist struggle. This work has become a driving force for promoting increased production and practicing economy. Workers in dozens of large factories and mines throughout the city have put forward resounding slogans such as "Use the brilliant achievements of increasing production and practicing economy to counter-attack bourgeois rightists," setting off a wave of socialist competition.

This work began in mid-July. Communist Party and Communist Youth League organizations in the iron and steel, coal mining, machinery, and textile systems mobilized a large number of propagandists to go deep into workshops, work sections, and residential areas to hold various report meetings and discussion meetings to systematically explain the current situation and major significance of the anti-rightist struggle to the workers. Units such as the Public Transportation Company used real people and events to create cartoons and hold roving exhibitions refuting rightist remarks. After education, many workers realized that the anti-bourgeois rightist struggle was a great socialist revolutionary movement and put forward the slogan "Unite in production and crush the rightist offensive." Among the seventy-eight new workers in the fourth workshop of the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, many people often demanded increased wages and promotions, and some were absent from work for no reason. Now, not only do they no longer make trouble, but they also actively help workers with weaker physical strength to do work after completing their own work. In the seventh workshop of this company, in the heat of the competition, six of the seven work sections continuously created new records; the forging section created new records as many as thirty-six times, and overfulfilled the July production task four hundred hours ahead of schedule.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 31st. Cities such as Nanjing, Xuzhou, Changzhou, Wuxi, and Suzhou have recently launched socialist education work for the broad masses of workers.

In Nanjing, twenty-eight state-owned and large-scale joint state-private factories have launched large-scale publicity and education activities by organizing workers to study documents and listen to reports. Units such as the Nanjing Machine Tool Factory and Puzhen Passenger Car Repair Factory also used publicity tools such as cartoons, picture exhibitions, blackboards, big-character posters, and wired broadcasts to introduce to the workers the changes and development of the factory in recent years and expose the reactionary fallacies of the bourgeois rightists. Units such as the China Cement Factory, Jiangnan Cement Factory, and Chemical Factory held rallies to refute rightist fallacies. Many veteran workers, veteran staff members, engineering technicians, and young workers from many factories held symposiums to refute the remarks of bourgeois rightists.

Through socialist publicity and education, the workers in various cities have further raised their class consciousness. After more than 95% of the workers in Xuzhou received education, their enthusiasm for production greatly increased, and recently many units have overfulfilled their tasks. The average daily output of the Jiawang Coal Mine was more than 5,000 tons of coal in the first half of this year, and now it has reached more than 7,000 tons per day. Workers at the Chenguang Machine Factory in Nanjing proposed to trial-produce the 2685-type pond tank machine before National Day.

Through publicity and education, the ranks of the working class have become more united. A small number of workers who originally had some opinions on welfare also expressed their willingness to put aside personal issues and unanimously oppose the bourgeois rightists. Many workers in Xuzhou said, "Socialism is a tall building built from the ground up, and welfare will come slowly." They expressed their firm obedience to the long-term interests of the country.

    广大职工奔赴反右派前线
    在深刻的阶级教育中成长
    吉林
    据新华社长春31日电　吉林省工厂矿山企业职工群众在反资产阶级右派分子斗争中受到了深刻的阶级教育。
    近两个月来，长春、吉林、四平、辽源、通化、延吉等工业城市，先后举行了千人、万人的工人大会，坚决有力地回击了资产阶级右派分子对共产党、对社会主义的猖狂进攻。首批进行整风的部分大型厂矿工人，还同本单位出现的资产阶级右派分子展开了面对面的说理斗争；同时各级党委在尚未开展整风的厂矿，向广大职工进行了大规模的反右派的阶级教育。各厂矿负责干部还把厂内外资产阶级右派分子的错误言论搜集起来向工人作报告，从而说明反击右派、保卫社会主义的严重政治意义。职工群众受到教育的面十分广，仅长春市就大约有十五万人听了一两次报告。
    各厂矿职工听了报告以后，召开各种座谈会、讨论会和职工代表会，是这次阶级教育采用的主要形式。
    反右派斗争不仅使职工群众进一步划清界限，分清敌我，提高了阶级警惕性，批判了一些个人的打算，而且成为推动增产节约运动走向深入的动力。长春市工厂企业开展了热烈的“献方献计”运动。6月下旬到现在，据国营橡胶八厂、新华印刷厂等六个单位的统计，职工献出“方”、“计”七百六十六个，解决了许多生产问题。历年6、7、8月炎热盛夏，造纸厂生产受天气影响，发生事故，质量波动，完不成计划，几乎成了常规。吉林造纸厂职工今年在反右派斗争中受到一系列阶级教育，生产责任心进一步加强，保证生产正常进行，做到安全生产，超额完成了任务。仅据7月份前二十天的统计，超产纸张一百七十五吨。
    重庆
    据新华社重庆31日电　重庆市各工厂矿山企业正在通过反资产阶级右派斗争，向广大职工进行普遍深入的社会主义教育。这项工作已成为推动增产节约的动力。全市几十个大型厂矿的职工纷纷提出：“拿增产节约的辉煌战果反击资产阶级右派”等响亮的口号，掀起社会主义竞赛的热潮。
    这一工作是7月中旬开始的。钢铁、煤矿、机械、纺织等系统中的共产党和共青团的组织，都动员了大批宣传员深入车间、工段和家属住宅区，召开各种报告会、座谈会，系统地向职工讲解当前反右派斗争的形势和重大意义。公共交通公司等单位以真人真事画成漫画，举办了驳斥右派言论的巡回展览。经过教育，很多职工认识了反资产阶级右派斗争是一场伟大的社会主义革命运动以后，提出“团结生产，粉碎右派进攻”的口号。重庆钢铁公司第四车间七十八个新工人中，很多人经常闹增加工资和升级，有的无故旷工；现在他们不但不再闹了，而且还在做好分内的工作以后主动帮助体力弱的工人做活。这个公司第七车间职工在竞赛热潮中，七个工段有六个连续创造了新纪录；锻工段创造新纪录达三十六次，提前四百小时超额完成了7月份生产任务。
    南京、徐州
    据新华社南京31日电南京、徐州、常州、无锡、苏州等城市，近来对广大职工展开社会主义教育工作。
    南京市二十八个国营和大型公私合营工厂，通过组织职工学习文件、听报告等方式，展开了大规模的宣传教育活动。南京机床厂、浦镇客车修理工厂等单位还运用漫画、图片展览、黑板报、大字报、有线广播等宣传工具，向职工介绍工厂几年来的变化和发展情况，揭露资产阶级右派分子的反动谬论。中国水泥厂、江南水泥厂、化学工厂等单位都举行了驳斥右派谬论的大会。有不少工厂的老工人、老职员、工程技术人员、青年工人等分别举行了驳斥资产阶级右派言论的座谈会。
    通过社会主义宣传教育，各城市的职工都进一步提高了阶级觉悟。徐州市百分之九十五以上的职工受到教育以后，生产积极性大大提高，最近很多单位都超额完成任务。贾汪煤矿今年上半年平均日产五千多吨煤，现在已达到日产七千多吨。南京市晨光机器厂职工提出要在国庆节前试制成二六八五型塘缸机。
    经过宣传教育，工人阶级的队伍更加团结了。少数原来对生活福利方面有些意见的工人，也都表示把个人问题放下，一致反对资产阶级右派分子。徐州市许多工人说，“社会主义是万丈高楼平地起，生活福利要慢慢来”。他们表示坚决服从国家的长远利益。
