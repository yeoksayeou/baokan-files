　　(Frustrated Fantasy of Yang Qing's Reactionary Group to Organize a "Second Major Party" and Contend with the Party)
    (Our Dispatch) At the recently concluded Sixth Session of the First People's Congress of Jilin Province, the representatives indignantly exposed the counter-revolutionary crimes of Yang Qing, a key rightist element in Jilin Province and the main representative of the Zhang-Luo Alliance stationed in Jilin. Yang Qing, taking advantage of his position as the chairman of the Northeast Normal University branch of the China Democratic League and the director of the Education Department of Northeast Normal University, colluded with Xie Jueyi, Wu Zhengli, and Cao Yanting (all members of the League), the directors of three teaching and research sections in the same department, to form an insidious reactionary group, attempting to create a "second major party" within the university to contend with the Communist Party.

    In order to strengthen the anti-communist front, Yang Qing conspired with Liu Zongxiang (member of the Jilin Provincial Preparatory Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and lecturer in the History Department of Normal University), the head of the right-wing group of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang in the school, and He Ji (professor in the History Department of Normal University), a rightist element, to jointly "run the school democratically." They also discussed personnel arrangements for democratic parties to participate in school leadership in the future. In addition, he personally visited student dormitories to incite students to make trouble; he colluded with Wang Xingye and Qu Shao, rightist elements and targets of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries among the students, and supported them in organizing a "rehabilitation group." He also introduced them to the legal advisory office to falsely accuse certain responsible persons of the school.

    On May 20th, Yin Yi, a reporter from Guangming Daily, came to Changchun to stir up trouble, and Yang Qing personally took the lead in launching a general offensive. At the forum, he maliciously described Communist Party members as "political aristocrats." He said, "There used to be a saying: 'Parents are never wrong.' It seems that this sentence should be changed to: 'Party members are never wrong.'" Yang Qing also greatly slandered the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, saying, "During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, as soon as someone wrote a material, they would be criticized without investigation or research," which he called "subjective adjudication." He regarded the suppression of counter-revolutionaries as a matter internal to the people, advocating that "dictatorship should not be emphasized exclusively." Yang Qing had a deep-seated hatred for Marxism-Leninism. He believed that the study of political theory was dogmatism, and that listening to political theory classes was like attending "worship" in church. He opposed ideological remolding of cadres and openly stated at a meeting of all faculty and staff in the department: "It is not allowed to criticize the idea of fame and gain."

    As early as before the rectification campaign, the Yang Qing reactionary group implemented the reactionary program of the Zhang-Luo Alliance to usurp leadership in the cultural and educational circles. They tried their best to attack the party branch secretary of the Education Department, the assistant director of the department (a party member), and activists close to the party, and used despicable means such as borrowing money, giving gifts, flattering, and supporting unreasonable demands to win over the masses and sow discord between the party and the masses in order to isolate the party organization. He took all the problems in the department to his small group for secret consultation. He openly declared: "My position as the director of the department is not under the leadership of the party branch, I want to work with power and authority, otherwise I will not do it."

    In order to establish a "second major party," he used the lure of "convenient scientific research after joining the League, and League members can become leaders" to attract people to join the League. He planned to develop the League members in the school to 120 by the end of this year, so that the "second major party" would be formed; he appointed himself as the leader of this "major party."

    Yang Qing also colluded with Ding Kequan (chairman of the Changchun Geological Exploration College branch of the China Democratic League, professor at Changchun Geological College) and He Shanzhou (vice chairman of the Changchun Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, director of the Chinese Department of Northeast Normal University), rightist elements in the League, to attack the progressive leaders of the League's provincial and municipal committees, trying to install members of his small group into the League's provincial and municipal committees, thereby usurping the leadership of the League's provincial and municipal committees.

    After the Yang Qing reactionary group was exposed, Yang Qing had to bow his head and admit his guilt, acknowledging his political ambition to usurp the Party's leadership in the Normal University. However, his relationship with the Zhang-Luo Alliance, the inside story and secret activities of the Yang Qing clique have not yet been explained. The struggle is currently deepening.

　　妄图组织“第二大党”和党分庭抗礼
　　杨清反动集团的狂想幻灭
    本报讯　不久以前闭幕的吉林省第一届人民代表大会第六次会议上，全体代表愤怒地揭发了吉林省右派骨干分子、章罗联盟派驻吉林的主将杨清的反动罪行。杨清利用民盟东北师大支部主委、东北师大教育系主任的职务，和同系三个教研室主任谢觉一、吴正礼、曹延亭（都是盟员）相勾结，形成了一个阴险的反动集团，妄图在校内搞“第二大党”，和共产党分庭抗礼。
    为了加强反共阵线，杨清和学校内的民革右派集团头子刘宗向（民革吉林省筹委委员、师大历史系讲师）和右派分子何基（师大历史系教授），共谋“民主办校”，他们还讨论了今后民主党派参加学校领导的人事安排。此外，他又亲自到学生宿舍访问学生，煽动学生闹事；他和学生中的右派分子、肃反对象王兴业、曲哨勾结一起，支持他们组织“平反小组”。他还介绍他们去法律顾问处，诬告学校的某些负责人。
    5月20日，光明日报记者殷毅到长春点火，杨清亲自出马，发起总攻。在座谈会上，他恶毒地把共产党员说成是“政治贵族”。他说：“过去有句俗话：‘天下无不是的父母’，看来应该把这句话改为：‘天下无不是的党员’”。杨清对肃反运动也大肆污蔑，他说，“在肃反时，一有人写材料，不经过调查研究就整起来”，他称这为“主观裁判权”。他把肃反看成是人民内部的事，主张“不能专讲专政”。杨清对马克思列宁主义有刻骨的仇恨。他认为政治理论学习就是教条主义，听政治理论课像上教堂做“礼拜”一样。他反对干部进行思想改造，他曾在全系教职员大会上公开提出：“不准批判名利思想”。
    早在整风以前，杨清反动集团就执行了章罗联盟篡夺文教界领导权的反动纲领。他们竭力打击教育系党总支书记、系主任助理（党员）以及靠近党的积极分子，并利用借钱、送礼、吹捧、支持不合理的要求等卑鄙手段拉拢群众，挑拨党群关系，以达到孤立党组织的目的。他把系内的一切问题都拿到他的小集团里去密商。他公开宣称：“我这个系主任不受党总支领导，我要干得有职有权，否则就不干。”
    为了成立“第二大党”，他用“入盟后科学研究方便，盟员可以做领导”的利诱手段拉人入盟。他计划到今年底在校内把盟员发展到一百二十人，这样“第二大党”就形成了；他自封为这个“大党”的领袖。
    杨清又勾结了盟内右派分子丁克全（民盟长春地质勘探学院支部主委、长春地质学院教授）、何善周（民盟长春市委副主委、东北师大中文系主任）打击民盟省、市委员会进步的领导人员，设法把他的小集团成员安插到民盟省、市委会中去，从而篡夺民盟省、市委的领导权。
    杨清反动集团被揭露后，杨清不得不低头认罪，承认了自己有篡夺党在师大领导权的政治野心。但他和章罗联盟的关系，杨清小集团的内幕和秘密活动却还没有交代。目前斗争正在深入中。（温述仙）
