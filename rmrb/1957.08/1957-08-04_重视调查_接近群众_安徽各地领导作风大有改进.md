Emphasis on Investigation, Close to the Masses

Significant Improvement in Leadership Style in Various Regions of Anhui

    This newspaper reports that the prominent improvements in various regions of Anhui Province during the rectification movement are a greater emphasis on investigation and research in leadership methods, and a leadership style that is closer to and more concerned about the masses. During the wheat harvest, the Fuyang Special District sent people to more than thirty cooperatives throughout the district to investigate wheat yields. The resulting figure was close to the figures reported by the counties, eliminating disagreements between higher and lower levels and between leaders and the masses.

    In order to study and promote the issue of rice straw fertilizer, the Anqing Special District first sent technical personnel to understand the soil quality, water conservancy, and other conditions of fields using rice straw fertilizer. At the same time, they sent many people to other counties to see if similar situations existed. As a result, they discovered that more than forty cooperatives throughout the district had adopted this method last year, and the results were generally good. At this time, the prefectural party committee convened a meeting of county party secretaries from the entire district and decided to promote it in areas where the masses were accustomed to it and had experience. Finally, this method was adopted on 400,000 mu of paddy fields, basically solving the problem of fertilizer shortage for late rice.

    The work of the offices has also improved compared to the past. In the past, the responsible comrades of the Bengbu Prefectural Party Committee had little contact with non-Party members, believing that contact with non-Party members was the responsibility of the United Front Work Department. Now, the responsible comrades of the special district and the prefectural party committee are proactively soliciting opinions from non-Party members on various aspects, greatly increasing the enthusiasm of non-Party cadres.

    重视调查  接近群众
    安徽各地领导作风大有改进
    本报讯　安徽省各地在整风中突出的改进是领导方法上更注意调查研究，领导作风上更加接近群众、关心群众。阜阳专区在麦收时曾分别派人深入全专区的三十多个合作社去调查小麦产量，然后再推算出全专区的产量，这样得出的数字就和各县上报的数字相近，消除了上下之间、领导和群众之间的意见。
    安庆专区为了研究和推广稻草肥料问题，先派技术人员去了解施用稻草肥料田的土质、水利等情况，同时又派很多人到其他县里去找，看是否有同样情况，结果发现全专区有四十多个合作社去年都采取了这个办法，效果一般都好。这时，地委才召开了全专区县委书记会议，决定在群众有习惯、有经验的地方推广。最后在四十万亩的稻田里采用了这个办法，基本解决了晚稻缺肥问题。
    机关工作比过去也有了改进。过去蚌埠地委的负责同志和党外人士接触少，认为和党外人士接触有统战部负责，现在专区、地委的负责同志都主动地向党外人士征求各方面的意见，非党干部的积极性大大提高。
