Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 5th. August 4th (the eighth day of the festival), Moscow held a youth song and dance festival, a pantomime competition, and a meeting between young students and Soviet polar workers.

    The festival's pantomime competition, with professional and amateur actors from ten countries in Europe, Asia, and the Americas participating, aroused widespread interest in Moscow. Soviet youth performed Krylov's "The Man Who Married Three Wives." Among the programs performed by Parisian comedy actors, the most popular were "The Growth of Life" and "Underground Tramway." In "The Growth of Life," an actor without makeup performed the entire life process of a person from birth to old age almost entirely in one spot on the stage, relying solely on gestures, facial expressions, and body movements. "Underground Tramway" reflected the lives of all kinds of Parisians from morning to night. Dutch actor Spool's comedy "Woman and Hat" also brought the house down. The Polish amateur pantomime troupe performed Gogol's "The Overcoat" with genius artistry. Israel's Lichtanbaum performed six pantomimes alone. Nine Chinese youths also participated in the performance.

    In the evening, delegations from Arab countries performed rich and varied Eastern arts for the festival participants at the Musical Theatre. Lebanon's folk dance "Dabke," Syria's classical dance "Sky," Iraq's dance "Gurd," and the songs of Sudanese black youth were all warmly welcomed. The Egyptian delegation performed a beautiful and enchanting excerpt from the dance drama "Oh, Night," which was full of oriental flavor. Algerian youth won warm applause, their melodious songs and long choruses fully expressing their love for their motherland and their strong fighting will.

    A Black African People's Cultural Evening was held at the Moscow Art Theatre.

    In the afternoon, Soviet North and South Pole workers met with university students from all over the world at the International Student Club, introducing them to polar life and interesting scientific research. During the meeting, congratulatory telegrams sent simultaneously from both poles of the Earth caused a burst of cheers. Chinese representative Tan Mingzhang accepted a small white bear from Soviet Arctic workers on behalf of Chinese youth. This little white bear has been named "Bai Yuanyou" (White Distant Friend).

    World-renowned writers and artists met with young people from various countries in the Column Hall of the Trade Union Building in the evening. Chinese poet Xiao San also participated in the meeting.

    在莫斯科艺术剧院举行了黑非洲人民文化晚会。
    苏联的南北极工作人员下午在国际学生俱乐部会见了来自世界各地的大学生们，向他们介绍了极地生活和有趣的科学研究。在会见过程中，从地球的两极同时发来的贺电，引起了大家一阵欢呼。中国代表谭铭璋代表中国青年在会上接受了苏联北极工作人员送的小白熊，这只小白熊已被命名为“白远友”。
