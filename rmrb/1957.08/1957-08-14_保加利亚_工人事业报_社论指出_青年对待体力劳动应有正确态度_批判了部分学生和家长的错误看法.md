Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, August 13th: The Bulgarian "Workers' Cause Newspaper" published an editorial on August 12, calling for a resolute struggle against the phenomenon of young students looking down on manual labor.

The editorial focused on criticizing the erroneous view held by some young students or parents that engaging in production labor after graduating from middle school is unlucky. It also called on organizations such as the local Communist Party, the Fatherland Front, and the Youth League to educate young people to have a correct attitude towards manual labor.

The editorial pointed out that in Bulgarian society, the most outstanding representatives of socialist labor are the most respected people. In the past decade, more than 17,000 workers and peasants have been awarded various medals and decorations. Young laborers have become role models in the production of various industrial and agricultural sectors. Labor has become a glorious, heroic undertaking and the duty of every member of society.

However, on the other hand, there are still some people in Bulgaria who evade labor and attempt to live off others. Some people are looking for highly paid and "easy" jobs; others refuse to work in more remote areas on various pretexts; and still others, who come from exploiting classes, evade physical labor, which is very helpful to their transformation, despite being healthy and capable of working. The editorial believes that this phenomenon must be condemned and fought against.

When discussing the attitude of young people and their parents towards labor, the editorial pointed out that some people believe that it is unfortunate and unlucky for young men and women who graduate from middle school to work in enterprises, cooperatives, and other departments instead of working as clerks in government offices; this view is completely wrong.

The editorial emphasized that due to continuous mechanization, labor in various industrial and agricultural sectors increasingly requires more knowledgeable and cultured skilled workers. In the future, the lives of those engaged in manual labor will be more prosperous and they will enjoy greater respect from the people. More young people will participate in production and become skilled people in production than before. Young people will certainly welcome the prospects that they have not yet seen or underestimated.

    保加利亚“工人事业报”社论指出
    青年对待体力劳动应有正确态度
    批判了部分学生和家长的错误看法
    据新华社索非亚13日电　保加利亚“工人事业报”8月12日发表社论，号召同青年学生轻视体力劳动的现象进行坚决斗争。
    这篇社论着重批判了一部分青年学生或家长认为中学毕业后从事生产劳动就是倒霉的那种错误看法，并且号召各地共产党、祖国阵线和青年联盟等组织教育青年以正确的态度对待体力劳动。
    社论指出，在保加利亚的社会中，社会主义劳动的最优秀的代表人物是最受尊敬的人。近十年来，有一万七千多名工人、农民获得了各种勋章和奖章。青年劳动者已经成为工农业各部门生产中的榜样。劳动已经成为光荣、豪迈的英勇事业和每一个社会成员的义务。
    但是另一方面，在保加利亚还有一些人逃避劳动，企图依靠别人来生活。有些人在寻找收入高而“轻松”的工作；还有一些人以种种借口拒绝到较偏僻的地方去工作；更有一些出身于剥削阶级的人虽然身体健康、有工作能力，却逃避那种十分有助于他们的改造的体力劳动。社论认为，必须对这种现象加以谴责和进行斗争。
    社论在谈到青年人和他们的家长对待劳动的态度时指出，有人认为，中学毕业的青年男女如果没有到机关去作职员而到企业、合作社等部门去工作，就是不幸的和倒霉的；这种看法是完全错误的。
    社论强调指出，工农业各部门的劳动由于不断地机械化，日益需要更有知识和文化的熟练工作者。今后，从事体力劳动的人的生活将更加富裕，将享受人们更大的尊敬。参加生产并成为生产中有素养的人的青年将比以前增多。青年们一定会欢迎他们现在尚未看到或者还估计不足的前途。
