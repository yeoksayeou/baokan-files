A Trick to Derail Disarmament Talks
Commentator of this newspaper

After spending four days in London, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles personally attended the Disarmament Subcommittee meeting on the 2nd and presented a proposal on the issue of aerial inspection areas on behalf of the Western countries.

This so-called proposal is nothing more than a political fraud carefully planned by Dulles and the British and French authorities. Its purpose is to lead the disarmament talks into a dead end of empty talk at a critical juncture, thereby continuing to obstruct it from reaching an agreement and shifting the responsibility for undermining the negotiations to the Western countries.

Aerial inspection is not a substantive issue in the disarmament talks; at best, it can only serve as a step in disarmament supervision. The main issues that need to be resolved quickly in the current disarmament talks are the cessation of nuclear weapons testing and the initial reduction of conventional armaments. However, the Western countries completely avoid discussing these two major issues of concern to the world and insist on putting the cart before the horse, hyping up the so-called "open skies." This is, in effect, an attempt to distort the discussion, turning serious international negotiations that should be conducted purposefully and step-by-step into a rambling, off-topic chat. British Labor MP Beswick also pointed out that this Western proposal is "not disarmament at all."

Why are Western countries adopting this tactic of substitution? The reasons stem from two aspects: on the one hand, the United States and Britain are both fervently implementing their nuclear arms programs, and France also hopes to retain its status as a future "nuclear power." Therefore, they have no intention of quickly signing any disarmament agreement, especially one that stops nuclear weapons testing and prohibits nuclear weapons. But on the other hand, they are under strong pressure both domestically and internationally to sign a preliminary disarmament agreement, especially to quickly stop nuclear weapons testing. This makes them afraid to easily bear the responsibility for breaking off negotiations. At the same time, in order to help the Adenauer group use the disarmament issue to win over voters in the upcoming West German elections, it is also unfavorable to collapse the disarmament talks at present.

It was under these circumstances that Dulles rushed to London to plan new delaying tactics. His original intention was to collude with Britain and France to come up with a so-called proposal on both the aerial inspection and the cessation of nuclear weapons testing issues. However, on the issue of nuclear weapons, the three Western countries have different agendas, and even if Dulles wanted to put together a semblance of a "joint proposal," it would not be easy. As a result, he had no choice but to rely solely on the tattered shield of "open skies" to hold off the situation for a while.

In the past two years, "open skies" has been the number one weapon used by the United States to obstruct disarmament. However, even some members of the American ruling group doubt how much deception value Eisenhower's masterpiece still has. Lippmann, a spokesman for the American bourgeoisie, recently said, "Unless some miracle occurs, is it conceivable that the world's major military powers already trust each other enough to let others constantly photograph them from the air?" Lippmann admitted, "It would be very strange indeed if we were to sign and ratify a treaty stipulating arrangements to fully disclose all military information to those we do not trust." Lippmann's words fully expose that the American clamor for aerial inspection is purely an affectation, and in its heart, it has no intention of reaching any agreement at all.

In past disarmament negotiations, the Soviet Union made great efforts due to the United States' insistence on aerial inspection. It accepted aerial inspection as a method of disarmament supervision and suggested that it be implemented gradually along with corresponding disarmament agreements, with the first step being to establish inspection zones in local areas of the Far East, North America, and Europe. However, in this proposal, the Western countries deliberately delineated the scope of inspection to be very large, or demanded to inspect the entire territory of the Soviet Union, or at least a large area of important regions of the Soviet Union and Eastern European socialist countries; and the territory of Western countries included in each type of inspection zone was much smaller than that of the other side. In addition, many important military bases of Western countries located in Japan, the Middle East, North Africa, and other places that seriously threaten the security of the Soviet Union are not included in the inspection at all. These many unreasonable and unrealistic demands further prove that Dulles's intention in putting forward this proposal is not to solve any problems, but merely to use it as a bargaining chip at the negotiating table to achieve the purpose of sensationalizing, shifting the topic of negotiations, and covering up the Western countries' conspiracy to deliberately delay negotiations. It is precisely for the same purpose that Dulles made his proposal very complicated, containing several interrelated programs, so that it would naturally take a lot of time to discuss it once. All of this shows that the Western countries' tricks are nothing more than trying to drag the negotiations into endless disputes and empty talk filled with confusion and trivialities.

    把裁军谈判拖入歧路的诡计
    本报评论员
    美国国务卿杜勒斯在伦敦活动四天之后，在2日亲自出席裁军小组委员会会议，代表西方国家提出了一个关于空中视察地区问题的建议。
    这个所谓建议，不过是杜勒斯和英法当局苦心地策划的一个政治骗局。目的是企图把裁军谈判在紧要关头引向空谈的歧路，从而继续阻挠它获致协议，并推卸西方国家破坏谈判的责任。
    空中视察本来不是裁军谈判中的实质问题，它充其量只能作为裁军监督中的一种步骤。目前裁军谈判所要迅速解决的，主要是停止核武器试验和初步裁减常规军备的问题。可是，西方国家对这两个全世界所关心的主要问题，却完全避而不谈，而硬要把车子套在马前面，大吹大擂所谓“开放天空”。这实际上是企图使讨论变质，把应当有目的、有步骤地进行的严肃的国际谈判，变成一场离开主题、漫无边际的扯淡。英国工党议员贝斯威克也指出，西方这种建议“根本不是裁军”。
    为什么西方国家要采取这种偷天换日的策略呢？原因来自两个方面：一方面，美英两国都正在狂热地执行它们的核子军备计划，而法国也希望保留将来成为一个“核子大国”的地位，因此，它们都无意迅速签订任何的裁军协议，特别是不愿停止核武器试验和禁止核武器。但另一方面，它们又受到国内国外要求签订一项初步裁军协议，特别是迅速停止核武器试验的强大压力。这就使它们不敢轻易担当破裂谈判的责任。同时，西方国家为了帮助阿登纳集团在即将到来的西德选举中在裁军问题上施展一些笼络选民的手段，也不利于在目前就把裁军谈判搞垮。
    杜勒斯就是在这种形势下赶到伦敦来策划新的拖延策略的。他原来的打算，是想纠合英法，在空中视察和停止核武器试验两个问题上都搞出一套所谓建议来。但是，在核武器问题上，西方三国各怀鬼胎，杜勒斯即使想凑成一个装装样子的“共同建议”也很不容易。这一来，他就只好专靠“天空开放”这块用得破烂不堪了的挡箭牌再来挡一阵了。
    在过去两年多中，“开放天空”一直是美国用来阻挠裁军的头号武器。但是，艾森豪威尔这个得意之作，连美国统治集团中也有人怀疑它究竟能有多大的欺骗价值了。美国资产阶级的代言人李普曼最近就说：“除非发生某种奇迹，世界上的军事大国已经彼此信任了，要它们让别人不断地从空中对它们摄影，这是可以设想的事吗？”李普曼承认：“如果我们竟然会签订和批准一项条约，规定作出安排来向我们所不信任的人完全透露全部军事情况，……那倒是很奇特的。”李普曼这几句话，充分地暴露了美国叫喊空中视察完全是一种做作，骨子里是根本不打算达成任何协议的。
    在过去的裁军谈判中，由于美国坚持要空中视察，苏联曾经作了很大的努力。它接受了空中视察作为裁军监督的一种方法，并建议随着相应的裁军协议而逐步实施，第一步是在远东、北美和欧洲的局部地区建立视察区。但是，西方国家在这次建议中，却故意把视察范围划得非常大，或者要求视察苏联的全部领土，至少也要包括苏联和东欧各社会主义国家的一大片重要地区；而且每一种视察区所包括的西方国家的领土都比对方的小得很多。此外，这个建议中对于西方国家设在日本、中东、北非等处的严重威胁苏联安全的许多重要军事基地，都一律不在视察之列。这许多既不合理、又不现实的要求，更加证明了杜勒斯提出这个建议的用意，完全不是为了解决任何问题，而不过是拿它到谈判桌上去讨价还价，以达到耸人听闻、转移谈判主题的目的，并且掩盖西方国家有意拖延谈判的阴谋。正是为了同样的目的，杜勒斯还把他的建议搞得非常复杂，其中包含互相牵涉的好几个方案，这样，讨论一遍也自然要花费很多时间了。所有这一切，都说明了西方国家的诡计，无非都是想把谈判拖到乱杂纷纭、枝枝节节的无休止的争执和空谈中去。
