    Rhinoceros
    First Exhibition at Beijing Zoo

    (Our Dispatch) A pair of black rhinos transported from Kenya, Africa, have met with the citizens of Beijing at the Beijing Zoo. It is said that this is the first time rhinos have been raised in Chinese zoos.

    This pair of precious animals were captured last year. One is male and the other female. They are approximately four to five years old, 2.45 meters long, 1.45 meters tall, and weigh about 1.5 tons. They are born with thick, armor-like skin and a pair of sharp horns on their noses. With such weapons, they are invincible on the African grasslands and are known as "tanks of the grasslands", even the most ferocious African lions are inferior to them.

    Black rhinos often live alone or in groups of two or three. Their sense of hearing and smell are very sensitive, but their eyesight is poor. A type of bird similar to a myna, called the rhinoceros bird, lives on their backs, specializing in pecking at parasites, while also helping the black rhino detect enemies. Rhinos are not carnivorous animals, but each rhino eats fifteen kilograms of feed every day. Keepers have already discovered that the female likes to eat tomatoes, while the male is keen on cucumbers.

    There are not many types of rhinos. There are five types: the Indian rhinoceros, the Javan rhinoceros, the Sumatran rhinoceros, and the African black and white rhinos, with the Indian rhinoceros being the most precious. Currently, the Indian government has banned hunting and only allows one to be exported each year. It is rumored that this animal may exist in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture of Yunnan Province, but this has not been confirmed. (Kan Dianyi) (Attached picture)

### 犀牛  北京动物园首次展出

    犀牛
    北京动物园首次展出
    本报讯　一对由非洲的怯尼亚运来的黑犀已经在北京动物园和首都市民见面。据说，这是我国动物园第一次饲养的犀牛。
    这一对珍贵动物是去年才捕获的，一雌一雄，年龄约四、五岁，身长二点四五公尺，高一点四五公尺，体重约一吨半。它们生得一身铁甲般的厚皮，还有一对长在鼻上的锐利的犀角，靠着这般武器使它们横行在非洲草原上所向无敌，被称为“草原上的坦克”，就连最凶猛的非洲狮都要逊它们一头。
    黑犀经常是单独的或两、三头一起生活，它们的听觉和嗅觉十分灵敏，但是两眼近视。在它们背上生活着一种像八哥似的犀牛鸟，专门啄食犀牛背上的寄生虫，同时也帮助了黑犀发现敌人。犀牛是不食肉的动物，但是每一天一头犀牛要吃十五公斤的饲料。饲养员已经发现雌的喜欢吃蕃茄，雄的热中于黄瓜。
    犀牛的种类不多，有印度独角犀、爪哇犀、苏门答腊犀、非洲的黑犀和白犀等五种，以印度独角犀为最珍贵。目前印度政府已行禁猎，每年只准出口一头。传说云南省西双版纳傣族自治州可能有这种动物，但是还没有证实。（阚甸义）（附图片）
