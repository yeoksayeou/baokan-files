　　A Victorious Debate at the Tianjin Science and Technology Association: Exposing the Rightist 雷海宗’s Cloak of “Academic Research” and Seeing Through His Conspiracy to Fundamentally Undermine Socialism
    (Our report) At the joint expanded meeting of the Tianjin Science and Technology Association Branch Committee and the council meetings of various specialized societies, held from August 13th to 17th, many people exposed and criticized the reactionary words and deeds of 雷海宗, professor of the History Department of Nankai University, deputy director of the Tianjin Branch of the Jiusan Society, and a rightist.
    雷海宗 consistently wore the cloak of “academic research,” wantonly attacking Marxism-Leninism. According to 魏宏运, lecturer in the History Department of Nankai University, 雷海宗 publicly stated the fallacy that “Marxism stopped in 1895” this April. Half a year prior to that, he had said, “Marxism stopped developing when Marx died (1883).” He also said, “Marxism stopped developing in 1877 (the year Engels' ‘Anti-Dühring’ was published).” 雷海宗 also once told students, “Lenin's book ‘Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism’ became obsolete after Hitler came to power in 1933 and has no reference value.” 魏宏运 said that 雷海宗's aim was to fundamentally negate Marxism-Leninism. Because Marxism-Leninism has now spread all over the world and has become the guiding ideology in the countries of our socialist camp, he does not dare to openly negate it, so he changes his approach, saying that Marxism “stopped developing” in this year or that year, in order to completely negate Marxism-Leninism.
    吴廷璆, deputy director of the Tianjin History Society and professor at Nankai University, listed the contributions of Lenin, Stalin, Mao Zedong, and others to the historical science of Marxism, refuting 雷海宗's fallacy that the historical science of Marxism did not develop. 吴廷璆 pointed out that the development of general Marxist historical science in the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries is also too numerous to mention, but 雷海宗, regardless of the facts, insisted that Marxism did not develop after 1895. His purpose was to deny the development of the Marxist workers' movement in various countries of the world since 1895, to deny the victory of the October Revolution and the establishment of the people's democratic countries, and to deny the victory of the Chinese revolution and the achievements of socialist construction. The reactionary fallacies continuously released by 雷海宗 are an attempt, under the cloak of "academic research," to deny the development of Marxism, to slander Marxism as dogmatism, to slander the science of the socialist camp as "weak" and "poor," to oppose Marxism, and at the same time to tout the development and "richness" of bourgeois social science, attempting to restore bourgeois social science in New China, and finally to abolish Marxism. And to abolish Marxism would naturally abolish socialism. That is why 雷海宗's reactionary remarks were applauded and cheered by other rightists and used as ideological weapons against Marxism.
    冯文潜, honorary director of the Tianjin Branch of the Chinese Philosophical Society and professor at Nankai University, said that 雷海宗 divided Marxist social science into two aspects: one is to summarize the experience of the workers' movement and the social revolutionary movement; the other is to summarize the experience of the entire historical process of mankind. Are the workers' movement and the social revolutionary movement not part of the experience of the entire historical process of mankind? Can they not be written in the accounts of social science? If the revolutionary theory of Marxism is not science at all, as 雷海宗 said, then what can we say? Then all the socialism we are building is a blind impulse, all nonsense. Perhaps this is the real intention of 雷海宗 in putting forward his absurd theory!
    雷海宗 also adopted the methods of insinuation and open and covert attacks to maliciously slander the achievements of New China, to slander certain policies of the Party and the state, and to sow discord between intellectuals and peasants and the Party and the state. According to 杨生茂, associate professor of the History Department of Nankai University, 雷海宗 once said to students, "Books after liberation have no academic value, reading them makes the mind rigid; from a business point of view, one should read more books before liberation." 雷海宗 also said, "At present, our educational policy is too general and too conceptual, and does not proceed from reality, so it cannot cultivate complete and sound students. After liberation, although corporal punishment of students has been prohibited, the spiritual abuse of children and young people today is very serious." 杨生茂 asked: When did our Party and the People's Government stipulate a policy of "spiritual abuse" of children and young people? 雷海宗 also said that intellectuals after liberation "generally do not say anything, or only say a set of false words that they are expected to say." 杨生茂 pointed out that this is maliciously sowing discord between the Party and intellectuals. 朱星, vice president of Hebei Tianjin Normal College, said in his speech that 雷海宗 said in his "academic lecture" on June 2 this year: "In any era, peasants are the best at passive resistance; as long as the ruling class makes them feel dissatisfied, they will slack off, sabotage, and deliberately reduce production, leaving nothing but what is needed for their own livelihood." This is simply an insult to the peasants of the new society, and a malicious provocation against the relationship between our peasants and the working class and the People's Government. 魏宏运 also revealed in his speech that when private industrial and commercial enterprises were implementing joint state-private ownership across the board, 雷海宗 heard that some shops had destroyed some useless old books, and said: "This is the second holocaust in China, the second burning of books and burying of scholars." 魏宏运 said that 雷海宗's malicious slander shows 雷海宗's deep hatred for the new society.
    雷海宗's series of reactionary words and deeds are not accidental, but are inseparable from his long-standing history of being anti-Soviet, anti-Communist, and anti-people. 魏宏运 revealed that 雷海宗 once said: "I (雷海宗) thought about things for Chiang Kai-shek before liberation even more thoroughly than Chiang Kai-shek himself." 朱星 also pointed out in his speech: Before liberation, 雷海宗 relied on the reactionary leader 朱家骅 and had been writing articles for reactionary newspapers and periodicals such as "Warring States Policy," "Contemporary Review," "Weekly Review," and "Central Daily," advocating fascism and clamoring against communism and the Soviet Union. He successively published more than one hundred articles, advocating fascism and clamoring against communism and the Soviet Union. 滕维藻, deputy director of the Tianjin Economic Society and professor at Nankai University, said: During the period from the War of Resistance Against Japan until the eve of the national liberation, in addition to editing reactionary publications, publishing reactionary articles and speeches, 雷海宗 also initiated a joint declaration against the Soviet Union by a group of professors at Southwest Associated University in Kunming, participated in anti-Soviet demonstrations, and wrote to Chiang Kai-shek, recommending 胡适 as the President of the Executive Yuan in order to "win people's hearts and win American aid." He also offered advice to Chiang Kai-shek, saying that China could only become "strong" and "unified" through fascism. 雷海宗 once published an article in a reactionary publication slandering the Communist Party, saying: "If the Communist Party is stripped of its foreign nouns and slogans, it is nothing more than a semi-secret and semi-public separatist force with a religious nature based on starving people. Its only real characteristic is dependence on foreign forces and denial of the nation..." 滕维藻 said that 雷海宗 is an old-brand expert in anti-communism and anti-Sovietism, with theory, political program, and practical actions, for twenty years as one day.

　　天津科联一场胜利的论战
　  揭穿右派分子雷海宗“研究学术”的外衣看透他从根本上破坏社会主义的阴谋
    本报讯　在8月13日到17日举行的天津“科联”分会委员会和各专门学会理事会联席扩大会议上，许多人揭露和批判了南开大学历史系教授、九三学社天津分社副主任委员、右派分子雷海宗的反动言行。
    雷海宗一贯地披着“学术研究”的外衣，肆意向马列主义进攻。据南开大学历史系讲师魏宏运揭露说：雷海宗在今年4月间公开发表
  “马克思主义停留在1895年”的谬论以前半年，就说过“马克思主义在马克思死时（1883年）就停止发展了。”又说过“马克思主义在1877年（恩格斯的‘反杜林论’出版那年）就停止了发展”。雷海宗还曾经对学生说：“列宁的‘帝国主义是资本主义的最高阶段’一书，在1933年希特勒上台后就陈旧了，没有参考价值了”。魏宏运说，雷海宗的目的是要从根本上否定马列主义。由于现在马列主义已经传遍了全世界，在我们社会主义阵营各国成了指导思想，他不敢公开否定，便换一种手法，说马克思主义哪一年哪一年“停止发展”，这样来全盘否定马克思列宁主义。
    天津史学分会副理事长、南开大学教授吴廷璆列举了列宁、斯大林、毛泽东等人的著作中对于马克思主义的历史科学的贡献，驳斥了雷海宗所谓马克思主义的历史科学没有发展的谬论。吴廷璆指出，苏联、中国及其他人民民主国家中一般马克思主义历史科学的发展，也是不胜枚举的，而雷海宗不顾事实，硬说马克思主义在1895年以后没有发展，目的在于否认1895年以来马克思主义工人运动在世界各国的发展，否认十月革命的胜利和人民民主国家的建立，否认中国革命的胜利和社会主义事业的成就。雷海宗连续放出的反动谬论，是企图在“学术研究”的外衣下，否定马克思主义的发展，诬蔑马克思主义为教条主义，诬蔑社会主义阵营的科学“薄弱”、“贫乏”，来反对马克思主义，同时吹嘘资产阶级社会科学的发展和“丰富”，企图使资产阶级社会科学在新中国复辟，最后取消马克思主义。而取消马克思主义，自然就取消了社会主义。这就是雷海宗的反动言论为什么得到其他右派分子的鼓掌欢呼，并且用来作为反对马克思主义的思想武器。
    中国哲学会天津分会名誉理事长、南开大学教授冯文潜说，雷海宗把马克思主义的社会科学分成两个方面：一是总结工人运动和社会革命运动的经验；一是总结人类全部历史过程中的经验。难道工人运动和社会革命运动就不是人类全部历史过程中的经验的一部分？就不能写在社会科学的帐内？如果马克思主义的革命理论像雷海宗说的那样，根本不是科学的话，我们还有什么可说呢？那我们所建设的社会主义都是盲目的冲动、都是瞎胡闹了。这也许就是雷海宗提出他的荒谬理论的真实企图吧！
    雷海宗还采取含沙射影、明枪暗箭的手法，恶毒地诬蔑新中国的成就，诬蔑党和国家的若干政策，挑拨知识分子和农民同党和国家的关系。据南开大学历史系副教授杨生茂揭露，雷海宗曾对学生说：“解放后的书没有学术价值，读了使脑筋僵化；就业务观点看，应多读解放前的书”。雷海宗还说：“目前，我们的教育方针太笼统太概念化，不从实际出发，因此不能培养教育出完满健全的学生。解放后，虽然禁止了对学生的体罚，但今天对儿童、青年在精神上的虐待却很严重。”杨生茂问道：我们党和人民政府，什么时候规定过要对儿童和青年实行“精神虐待”的方针政策呢？雷海宗还说，解放以后的知识分子“一般地是一言不发的，或者是只发希望他们发的一套假言”。杨生茂指出，这是恶意地挑拨党和知识分子的关系。河北天津师范学院副院长朱星发言说，雷海宗在今年6月2日所发表的“学术讲演”中曾说：“无论在什么时代，农民都是最善于消极抵抗的；统治阶级只要叫他感到不满，他就会怠工、破坏、故意减产，除了自家糊口外一粒无余。”这简直是对新社会的农民的污辱，而且是对我国农民同工人阶级、同人民政府的关系的恶毒挑拨。魏宏运在发言中也揭露说，在私营工商业实行全行业公私合营时，雷海宗听说某些商场毁了一些无用的旧书，就说：“这是中国的第二次浩劫，是第二次焚书坑儒”。魏宏运说，雷海宗进行这样恶毒的诬蔑，说明雷海宗对新社会的刻骨仇恨。
    雷海宗的一系列的反动言行并不是偶然的，是和他长期以来反苏反共反人民的历史分不开的。魏宏运揭露说，雷海宗曾经说过：“我（雷海宗）在解放前替蒋介石着想，比蒋介石自己还要周到。”朱星在发言中也指出：雷海宗在解放前曾投靠反动头目朱家骅，一直为“战国策”“当代评论”“每周评论”“中央日报”等反动报刊撰写文章，他先后曾发表过一百多篇文章，鼓吹法西斯主义，叫嚣反共反苏。天津经济学会副理事长、南开大学教授滕维藻发言说：雷海宗在抗日战争直到全国解放前夕这一段时期中，除了主编反动刊物、发表反动文章和演说而外，在昆明时还发动西南联大的一批教授联合发表反苏宣言，参加反苏游行，并且上书蒋介石，推荐胡适作行政院长以期“收拾人心，争取美援。”他还给蒋介石献策说，中国只有法西斯化才能“强大”，才能“统一”。雷海宗曾在反动刊物上发表文章诬蔑共产党说：“共产党若剥去外来的名词和口号，不过是一个半秘密半公开的，带有宗教性的，以饿民为基础的割据势力。它的唯一真正特点，就是依附外力与否认国家民族……”。滕维藻说，雷海宗在反共反苏方面，是有理论，有政治纲领，有实际行动，二十年如一日的老牌专家。
