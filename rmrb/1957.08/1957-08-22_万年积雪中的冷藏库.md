    Cold Storage in the Perpetual Snow
    In Greenland, near the Arctic Circle, experiments are underway to excavate ice tunnel cold storage within the perpetual snow. Excavation work began two years ago, and the project plans to complete an ice tunnel approximately three hundred meters long soon.
    Once the cold storage is completed, it will be covered by sixty meters of ice above and thirty meters of ice below. It is estimated that the temperature can be maintained at 14 degrees Fahrenheit regardless of winter or summer. Once the excavation is successful, it will be the world's largest cold storage facility.

    万年积雪中的冷藏库
    在北极附近格林兰的万年积雪之中，现在正在试验着挖建冰隧道的冷藏库。挖建工事在两年前开始，计划不久将可完成长约三百公尺的冰隧道。
    冷藏库建成后，上面的冰厚六十公尺，下面的冰厚三十公尺，不论冬夏估计都可以保持温度为华氏14度。挖建成功后，这将是世界上最大的冷藏库。
