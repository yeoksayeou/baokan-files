Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 26th: Dong Xuelong, alternate member of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and deputy secretary of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, has had his conspiracy activities of opposing the Communist Party and opposing socialism exposed after nearly a month of exposure and struggle by the masses.

Dong Xuelong is a rightist element who infiltrated the Communist Party. With ulterior political ambitions, he deceived the Communist Party's trust by fabricating history and misleading the organization. After seizing a high-level leadership position within the League, he launched vicious attacks on the leadership of the Communist Party. He tried his best to pull the Communist Youth League out of the leadership orbit of the Communist Party, openly declaring at the office meeting of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the League that "the main contradiction of the League at present is the contradiction between the League and the Party," that "the Party controls the League too tightly." He exaggerated individual shortcomings in the Party committee's leadership work over the Communist Youth League and embellished them. He maliciously criticized League cadres for having "too weak backbones," and incited lower-level cadres to "push back" the Party committee's instructions, in order to resist and denigrate the Party's leadership and reach out to the Party for "the League's independent right to act." In March of this year, after returning to Kunming from participating in the national meeting of provincial and municipal Party secretaries of the League, he promoted among the organ cadres of the Provincial Committee of the League that "the central committee of the League and the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Party had different approaches." He even believed that the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party's emphasis on class stance education did not conform to the central government's "loosening" policy. In his daily work, Dong Xuelong also directly confronted the Party's instructions. When the League newspaper erroneously published a cartoon distorting the lives of workers and was criticized by the Party committee, Dong told the League newspaper staff: "This is not a mistake. Don't be 'blown over' after taking a lesson at the 'Party stereotyped writing' place (referring to the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party)."

It was revealed that Dong Xuelong has long opposed the method of class analysis and the education of intellectual youth on class stance. He consistently emphasized the so-called "dark side" of the Party's work. He also used his authority as the direct leader of the "Frontier Youth News" to attempt to change the nature of the League newspaper. He instructed reporters to specifically look for the so-called "dark side" to report on. He supported the rightist element Liu Zengyu in the newspaper's proposal to run a like-minded publication, turning the League newspaper into an "independent public opinion organ." According to Lin Chuping, the deputy editor-in-chief of the League newspaper, the nature and political direction of the "Frontier Youth News" had, at one point during the great blooming and contending, undergone a negative change, its guiding role was greatly weakened, and its characteristics as a newspaper for rural youth were blurred.

During the great blooming and contending, Dong Xuelong ignited fires everywhere, directly supporting the rightist elements' attack on the Communist Party. After returning to Kunming from Beijing, he greatly promoted the big-character posters on the Peking University Democracy Wall that attacked the Communist Party, saying that the rightist attack was "just like the anti-American movement before liberation" and a manifestation of "active youth thinking." He also fabricated facts, saying that "there have also been several cases in Yunnan of youth being harmed to death by bureaucracy," arranged to collect materials, and opened fire on the Party. He incited some people who were dissatisfied with the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and other movements to "air their grievances" to the Party, and openly slandered active elements in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries as "little public security bureau chiefs." He repeatedly encouraged those with serious right-leaning views, wanting to make them "excited, excited, and even more excited." After the reactionary slogan "Down with the Communist Party" appeared at the provincial League school, he reported to the students that "there are no rightist elements in the League school." When rightist elements attacked the Party on the issues of suppression of counter-revolutionaries and cadre review at the League committee's organ cadre meeting, Dong openly praised and supported them. He even supported the words and deeds of the rightist elements in his capacity as a member of the leading group.

It was revealed that in order to realize his personal political ambitions and usurp the leadership of the Provincial Committee of the League, Dong openly attacked Wang Yuhui, the secretary of the Provincial Committee of the League, saying that he was "out of touch with reality and should be sent down to the lower levels for training," and that Cui Yong, another deputy secretary, was incompetent and "couldn't accomplish much," promoting that only he himself was "knowledgeable" and "talented," and the "most capable person." He also used the method of promising official positions everywhere to sow discord, win over the backward, cultivate confidants, and establish personal prestige. According to preliminary revelations, as many as eight people have been won over and confused by him. According to accusations, he had even secretly determined candidates and had a blueprint for a "major reorganization" of the Provincial Committee of the League with himself as the secretary. However, just as he was carried away, the masses exposed his anti-Party conspiracy.

It was revealed that Dong Xuelong had long used the method of deceiving the organization and shamelessly boasting about himself. According to already revealed and verified materials, this self-proclaimed "youth leader" before liberation was originally a deserter from the "July 15th" student movement in Kunming. He had never participated in the "December 1st" movement at the time. After liberation, he found some documents and materials from old bookstores and made a big fuss about it, pretending to be the leader of the movement. He boasted everywhere that he was a "guerrilla hero" before the liberation of Yunnan, but he had never participated in the underground guerrilla armed forces in Yunnan. He only heard a little about the story of the guerrilla war at a certain meeting and fabricated it into his own experience. He only joined the Communist Party in February 1949, when the victory or defeat of the People's Liberation War was already a foregone conclusion, but he fabricated it as a member of the Party in 1948. His father was an instructor at the Kuomintang Aviation School, but he said that his class status was petty bourgeoisie.

After the anti-Communist Party and anti-socialist conspiracy of the rightist Dong Xuelong was preliminarily exposed, it aroused great indignation among the members of the Communist Youth League organization in Yunnan Province. As of yesterday, the organ cadres of the Provincial Committee of the League had held ten different meetings for this purpose. Although Dong Xuelong has admitted his shameless act of fabricating history and deceiving the organization in the face of irrefutable facts, he is still trying his best to disguise himself as merely having "ideological problems" and "differences of opinion in work." The struggle against Dong Xuelong is continuing.

### 不准把共青团拉出共产党领导的轨道　董学隆篡团反党受到痛击

    不准把共青团拉出共产党领导的轨道
　　董学隆篡团反党受到痛击
    据新华社昆明26日电　共青团中央候补委员、共青团云南省委副书记董学隆一贯反对共产党、反对社会主义的阴谋活动，经过群众近一个月的揭发和斗争，已经败露。
    董学隆是混入共产党内的一个右派分子，他怀着不可告人的政治野心，用伪造历史、蒙蔽组织的办法，骗取了共产党的信任。他在窃据了团内高级领导岗位以后，就对共产党的领导进行了恶毒的攻击。他竭力想把共青团拉出共产党领导的轨道，在共青团云南省委办公会议上公开宣称“当前团的主要矛盾，是团和党的矛盾”，是“党把团统得过死”。他夸大党委对共青团领导工作上的个别缺点，加以渲染，他恶意地批评团的干部“腰杆太细”，煽动下级干部要把党委的指示“顶回去”，以此来抗拒和诋毁党的领导，向党伸手“要团的独立活动权”。今年3月，他在参加了全国团的省、市委书记会议回到昆明以后，就在团省委的机关干部中宣传“团中央和党的云南省委口径不合”，他甚至认为中共云南省委强调阶级立场的教育不符合中央放的方针。在日常工作中，董学隆还直接对抗党的指示。当团报错误地刊登了歪曲工人生活的漫画而受到党委批评后，董却对团报工作人员说：“这不是什么错误，你们不要到‘党八股’那里（指中共云南省委）上了一课便‘顺风倒’。”
    据揭露，董学隆长期以来反对阶级分析的方法和对知识青年进行阶级立场的教育。他一贯强调党的工作的所谓“阴暗面”。还利用他直接领导“边疆青年报”的职权，企图改变团报的性质，他指示记者要专门找所谓“阴暗面”加以报道。他支持报社右派分子刘增羽办同人报的主张，使团报成为“独立的舆论机关”。据团报副主编林触平揭发，“边疆青年报”在大鸣大放中的性质和政治方向一度已有不好的转变，指导性大大削弱，以农村青年为对象的特点也模糊了。
    在大鸣大放中，董学隆更到处点火，直接支持右派分子对共产党的进攻。他从北京回到昆明，就大事宣传北大民主墙上向共产党攻击的大字报，把右派的进攻，说成“真和解放前反美运动一样”，是“青年思想活跃”的表现。他还捏造事实，说“云南被官僚主义害死青年的事也有几起”，布置搜集材料，向党开火。他煽动一些对肃反等运动不满的人向党“伸冤”，并公开污蔑肃反积极分子是“小公安局长”。他给右倾观点严重的人一再打气，要使他们“激动、激动、再激动”。他在省团校出现了“打倒共产党”的反动标语以后，竟向学员报告说“团校没有右派分子。”团委机关干部大会上右派分子在肃反、审干问题上向党进攻时，董公开赞扬和支持他们，他甚至以领导小组成员的身份来支持右派分子的言行。
    据揭露，董为了实现他个人的政治野心，篡夺团省委的领导，公开打击团省委书记王宇辉，说他是“脱离实际，应放到下层锻炼”，另一副书记崔勇是无能，“成不了大事”，宣扬只有他自己才是“知识里手”和“富有才华”，“最能干的人”。他还到处用封官许愿的办法挑拨离间，拉拢落后，培养心腹，树立个人威信。据初步揭露，受他拉拢和迷惑的已有八人之多。根据检举，他甚至已经暗中确定人选，有了一个以自己任书记的、将团省委“大改组”的蓝图。但是，正当他在得意忘形的时候，群众却将他的反党阴谋揭穿了。
    据揭露，董学隆曾长期用欺骗组织的手法，卑劣地作自我吹嘘。据已揭露并查证确实的材料证明：这个自封为解放前的“青年领袖”，原来是昆明“七·一五”学生运动中的逃兵，他根本没有参加过当时的“一二·一”运动，解放以后却从旧书店中找到一些文献资料而大做文章，假冒自己是运动的领导者。他到处吹嘘自己是云南解放前的“游击英雄”，但是他根本没有参加过云南地下的游击武装，只是在某一次会议上听到了一点游击战争的故事，就编造成自己的经历。他是在1949年2月人民解放战争胜负已成定局的形势下才混入共产党的，但他却伪造为1948年的党员。他父亲是国民党航空学校的教官，他却说自己的成份是小资产阶级。
    右派分子董学隆的反共产党反社会主义阴谋被初步揭穿以后，激起了云南省共青团组织成员的极大愤慨。到昨天为止，团省委机关干部已为此举行了十次大小不同的会议，董学隆在无可辩驳的事实面前虽然已经承认了他伪造历史、欺骗组织的无耻行为，但是还在竭力想把自己装扮成仅是“思想问题”和“工作意见分歧”。对董学隆的斗争，现在正在继续进行。
