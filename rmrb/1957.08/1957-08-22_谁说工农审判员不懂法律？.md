　　Who Says Worker-Peasant Judges Don't Understand the Law?
　　In Shanghai, seventy judges from worker and shop employee backgrounds have handled more than 7,000 cases, with over 96% being completely correct and not a single one being completely wrong.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 21st. Xinhua News Agency reporter Lu Ying reports: This reporter recently investigated the case-handling situation of seventy judges from worker and shop employee backgrounds in the fifteen grassroots people's courts of Shanghai. This investigation proves that these judges have a good quality of case handling, and the right-wingers' fallacies such as "worker-peasant judges do not understand the law" are completely unfounded.

    From January to July of this year, among the more than 7,000 criminal and civil cases concluded by these judges, cases that were correctly judged or mediated in the first instance, and cases where appeals were rejected and the original judgments were upheld because the parties did not have sufficient grounds, accounted for more than 96% of the total number of cases; cases that were retried and overturned by higher courts due to improper judgments after the parties appealed accounted for less than 4%. Among these more than 7,000 concluded cases, not a single one was completely unjust or completely wrongly judged.

    These judges were all the first batch of worker and shop employee judges who grew up through the "Five-Anti" People's Courts five years ago. The most valuable characteristic of their case handling is that they have a clear and firm stance in safeguarding the interests of the working class. Many judges are good at going to the scene to investigate the case tirelessly, carefully analyzing the facts, and making a fair judgment based on the nature of the case. In May of this year, when the Penglai District People's Court was trying the counter-revolutionary Zhou Liquan, Judge Huang Jianping, in order to verify the defendant's crimes and clarify the nature of the case, personally went to the scene of the defendant's crime in Rugao County, Jiangsu Province, thirteen years ago to conduct a detailed investigation, proving that the defendant had indeed committed counter-revolutionary crimes and sentenced him to imprisonment in accordance with the law. On August 8, in the civil court of the Yangpu District People's Court, the plaintiff Chen Boliang (an engineer) firmly demanded a divorce from his wife Li Xiuzhen (a worker). Xin Wenying, a judge from a textile worker background, learned after repeated investigations that the real reason for the plaintiff's request for divorce was that he disliked his wife's appearance and wanted to find a new love. After deliberation by the collegiate panel, Xin Wenying made a judgment and refused to accept Chen Boliang's request for divorce.

    Some seemingly trivial disputes, as long as the parties sue in court, the judges do not hesitate to take the time to investigate the facts of the dispute on the spot and help mediate. When judges encounter more complex disputes such as housing and marriage, they often investigate with jurors and make on-site investigation diagrams of the case, so that some parties who make unreasonable defenses have to obey the judgment. Once, the Xuhui District People's Court received a complaint from a woman named Zhang Songxing, who firmly demanded that she recover the property rights of a foreign house from her mother-in-law. The plaintiff provided the court with a lot of evidence to prove that the property rights of the house had belonged to her before her divorce, but the defendant's mother-in-law could not produce evidence, only denying it. Judge Zhang Ping and the jurors investigated this dispute more than ten times, and finally found all the historical files of the defendant buying and transferring the house before liberation, and also found every witness related to the dispute over the house. Finally, it was found that some of the plaintiff's main evidence had been deliberately forged by herself over the years.

    The reporter also investigated whether these judges acted legally in handling the above-mentioned cases. The investigation shows that they can earnestly and relatively skillfully try various cases in accordance with the statutory trial procedures. For the conclusion of the above-mentioned more than 7,000 cases, except for simple civil cases and minor criminal cases stipulated by law, the cases are all tried in public by a collegiate panel composed of judges and people's assessors in accordance with the law. The investigation also found that a few worker and shop employee judges in the People's Courts of Xincheng, Hongkou and other districts did indeed have individual phenomena in the trial of cases where they had not fully followed the trial procedures, but this phenomenon was corrected in a timely manner during the re-trial in accordance with the trial supervision procedures.

    谁说工农审判员不懂法律？
　　上海七十个工人、店员出身的审判员判案七千多件，完全正确的占96％以上，没有一件是全错的。
    新华社上海21日电　新华社记者鲁影报道：记者最近在上海市的十五个基层人民法院里调查了七十个工人、店员出身的审判员的办案情况。这次调查证明，这些审判员办案质量良好，右派分子所谓“工农审判员不懂法律”等谬论是完全没有根据的。
    从今年1月到7月，经过这些审判员审结的七千多件刑事和民事案中，经一审判决或者调解处理正确，以及因当事人无充分理由被驳回上诉而维持原判的案件，共占案件总数的96％以上；由于当事人上诉，上级法院发现判决欠妥而进行重审和改判的案件，不到4％。在这七千多件审结案中，没有一件是完全冤枉和完全判错的。
    这些审判员全部是五年前经过“五反”人民法庭的锻炼而成长起来的第一批工人、店员审判员。他们在办案中最可贵的特点是具有鲜明、坚定的维护工人阶级利益的立场。许多审判员善于不辞辛苦地赴现场调查案情，细致分析事实，依据案件性质，作出严正的判决。今年5月，蓬莱区人民法庭在审判反革命分子周立泉时，审判员黄剑平为了核实被告的罪行，弄清案件的性质，曾经亲自到被告十三年前在江苏如皋县的犯罪地点去作详细查对，证明被告确实犯有反革命罪行，即严肃地依法判处徒刑。8月8日在杨浦区人民法院民事审判庭上，原告陈伯良（工程师）坚决要求与他妻子李秀珍（工人）离婚。纺织工人出身的审判员辛文英经过再三调查，了解到原告要求离婚的真正原因是嫌妻子不漂亮，企图另找新欢。经合议庭评议，辛文英就作出判决，拒绝接受陈伯良的离婚要求。
    有些看来十分细小的纠纷，只要当事人告到法院，审判员也不嫌其烦地抽时间去实地查清纠纷事实，帮助调解。审判员们遇到事实较复杂的房屋、婚姻等纠纷，还常常同陪审员一起调查，并制作案情现场调查图，使一些进行无理强辩的当事人不得不服从判决。有一次，徐汇区人民法院收到妇女张颂星的诉状，坚决要求从她婆婆手中收回一座洋房的产权，原告向法院提供了许多证据，证明房屋的产权在她离婚前早已归她所有，而被告的婆婆却拿不出证据，只是否认。审判员张萍和陪审员一起，对这件纠纷调查了十多次，终于找到了解放前被告买进和转让这座房屋的全部历史档案，还找到了每一个有关这座房屋纠纷的证人，最后终于查明原告一些主要的证据都是自己多年来蓄意伪造的。
    记者还就这些审判人员在办理上述案件中是否合法的问题进行了调查。调查表明：他们都能认真地和比较熟练地依照法定的审判程序审理各种案件。对上述七千多件案件的审结，除了法律规定的简单的民事案件和轻微的刑事案件以外，都依法由审判员和人民陪审员组成合议庭，进行公开审理。调查中也发现，新成、虹口等区人民法院个别工人、店员出身的审判员在审理案件中，确实产生过个别未曾完全依照审判程序进行审理的现象，但是这种现象都在依照审判监督程序重新审理中及时作了纠正。
