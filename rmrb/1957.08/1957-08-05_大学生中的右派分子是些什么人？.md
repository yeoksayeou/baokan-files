The materials provided by Sichuan University show that among the rightists, those with political problems themselves, those with class hatred for the Communist Party, and those who adhere to the position of the exploiting classes, account for 91 percent.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, August 3rd: What kind of people are the rightists among university students? Sichuan University recently provided noteworthy materials. Among the students at this university, there are 88 rightists, including 15 who are political suspects, historical counter-revolutionaries, and members of reactionary parties and groups; 24 whose direct relatives and uncles, brothers were suppressed or sentenced to imprisonment or control, and who have class hatred for the Communist Party; and 41 from landlord, rich peasant, or capitalist families, who adhere to the position of the exploiting classes; these three categories account for 91% of the total number of rightists. After the "Great Blooming, Great Contending," they believed that the time had come, and they rose up to launch organized attacks on the Communist Party and the people.

	Luo Yifu, a student in the Department of History at this university, whose father was suppressed, harbors a deep hatred for the Communist Party. After the "Great Blooming, Great Contending" began, he spread reactionary remarks everywhere, such as "The proletarian dictatorship is the Party's world" and "Communist Party members are the rulers of the people," and colluded with another rightist student, Xiao Yanzuo, whose father was executed by the government, in an attempt to organize a small group to carry out reactionary activities. Another rightist student in the Department of Chemistry, Lu Yuanhui, whose father was the manager of a private company before liberation, with "cars coming in and out, and gold and silver filling the house," was ideologically dissatisfied after liberation. When the "Great Blooming, Great Contending" began, Lu Yuanhui believed that the four democratic parties would soon merge into a large party of intellectuals to confront the Communist Party on an equal footing, and the Communist Party would be driven out of the school. Therefore, he colluded with the rightist Long Ang to prepare to organize the "Curie Society" to join the China Democratic League after the "Great Blooming, Great Contending."

	The above is just the material from one university. The statistical materials of 45 rightist backbones among students in eight colleges and universities in Chengdu also illustrate this problem. Among these rightist backbones, 16 had parents who were executed, sentenced to long-term imprisonment, or committed suicide for fear of punishment; 19 came from landlord, rich peasant, capitalist, or bureaucratic families; the remaining ten had political problems, were consistently dissatisfied with reality, or lived a decadent life. It can be seen that most of the rightists have class roots, and they harbor deep class hatred for the Communist Party and the working people. This proves that the anti-rightist struggle is indeed a serious class struggle.

### 大学生中的右派分子是些什么人？

    大学生中的右派分子是些什么人？
    四川大学提供的材料说明：在右派分子中，本身有政治问题的、对共产党有阶级仇恨的、坚持剥削阶级立场的，共占百分之九十一。
    新华社成都3日电　大学生中的右派分子是些什么人？四川大学最近提供了一项值得注意的材料。这个大学学生中有右派分子八十八人，其中政治上的嫌疑分子、历史上的反革命分子、反动党团分子共十五人；直系亲属和叔伯、兄弟被镇压或被判徒刑、管制，对共产党有阶级仇恨的共二十四人；出身地主、富农或资本家家庭，坚持剥削阶级立场的共四十一人；这三类人共占右派分子总数的91％。“大放、大鸣”以后，他们认为时机已到，纷纷起来向共产党向人民进行有组织的进攻。
    这个大学的历史系学生罗毅夫，父亲被镇压，对共产党刻骨仇恨，“大鸣大放”开始后，就四处散播“无产阶级专政就是党天下”、“共产党员是人民的统治者”等反动言论，并和另一个父亲被政府处决的右派分子学生萧延柞勾结起来，企图组织小团体，进行反动活动。另一个化学系右派分子学生鲁元辉，解放前父亲是私营公司经理，“汽车进出，金银满屋”，解放后思想上不满。“大鸣大放”开始，鲁元辉就认为四个民主党派即将合并成为一个知识分子的大党，与共产党分庭抗礼，共产党就要被赶出学校。因此他纠合右派分子龙昂准备组织“居里社”，待“大鸣大放”后加入民盟。
    上面所说的仅是一个大学的材料。成都市八所大专学校学生中四十五个右派骨干分子的统计材料，也同样说明了这个问题，这些右派骨干分子中，父母亲被处决、判长期徒刑或畏罪自杀的共有十六人；家庭系地主、富农、资本家或官僚的共十九人；其余十人，有的有政治问题，有的一贯不满现实，有的生活堕落。可以看出：右派分子大多有着阶级根源，他们对共产党和劳动人民存有很深的阶级仇恨。由此证明，反右派斗争的的确确是一场严重的阶级斗争。
