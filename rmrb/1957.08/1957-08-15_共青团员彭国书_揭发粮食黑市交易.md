    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, August 11th: Peng Guoshu, a seventeen-year-old girl and member of the Communist Youth League in Langshan Township, Jiangjin County, Sichuan Province, exposed an ongoing black market grain transaction. The Langshan Township People's Committee immediately investigated and apprehended the speculator Zheng Jinhe, who was illegally purchasing grain, and the grain he had already purchased and stored.

    Peng Guoshu is a member of the Communist Youth League and a member of the Shunjiang Agricultural Cooperative. Recently, she noticed that people were frequently and furtively carrying grain to the home of Zheng Jinhe, a cooperative member who lived across from her. She secretly inquired and discovered that Zheng Jinhe had been commissioned by a wealthy farmer from a neighboring county to collude and purchase corn within the cooperative at a price twice as high as the state price. He then planned to secretly transport it to Chongqing to sell it at a high price. Peng Guoshu's father also intended to sell some grain to Zheng Jinhe, but Peng Guoshu firmly opposed it. On July 30th, the Shunjiang Agricultural Cooperative held a meeting of Party members, Youth League members, and activists, calling on everyone to fight against all acts that undermine socialism.

    共青团员彭国书
    揭发粮食黑市交易
    新华社成都11日电　四川江津县琅山乡一个十七岁的姑娘彭国书，揭发一件正在进行的粮食黑市交易。琅山乡人民委员会当即将套购粮食的投机分子郑金河和他已套购收藏的粮食查获。
    彭国书是共青团员，顺江农业社社员。最近，她发现时常有人鬼鬼祟祟地把粮食挑往住在她家对面的社员郑金河家里。她暗中打听，原来郑金河受了邻县一个富裕农民的委托，用串连的办法，在社内用高出国家牌价一倍的价格收购玉米，然后偷运到重庆去以高价出卖。彭国书的父亲也打算卖给郑金河一些粮食，但彭国书坚决反对。7月30日，顺江农业社举行党团员和积极分子大会，号召大家向一切破坏社会主义的行为斗争。
