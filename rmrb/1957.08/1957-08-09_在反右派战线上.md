    On the Anti-Rightist Front

    Rightist Backbone Element Li Jingzhi Begins to Confess His Crimes

    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 7th: Li Jingzhi, a member of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK) and a backbone element of the bourgeois rightists, has begun to confess his crimes.

    During the rectification movement, Li Jingzhi went to Kaifeng three times in a row to direct Song Yuxiu, the head of the RCCK Kaifeng Municipal Committee and a rightist, to set fires among social figures. At a forum he personally presided over in Kaifeng, more than 30 attendees were targets of the Three-Anti and Five-Anti movements, purged elements, and other elements dissatisfied with the Party. He added fuel to the fire of their anti-Party hatred. He also suggested that RCCK organizations in other places copy his experience in setting fires.

    Before liberation, Li Jingzhi successively served as Secretary-General of the Pseudo-Nanyang Special Office and Director of the Nanyang "Avant-Garde Daily." He participated in the Blue Shirts Society, a Kuomintang secret service organization, and was therefore regarded as a "military advisor" by the local ruling forces.

    Currently, Li Jingzhi has begun to lower his head and confess his crimes and is continuing to explain his relationship with rightist backbone elements such as Liu Jixue and Wang Yizhai.

    Advocating That the Party Newspaper Should Not Be Led by the Party
    Ni Hongyi's Fallacy Has Been Refuted

    Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, 7th: Rightist Ni Hongyi's conspiracy to attack the Party newspaper, the Dalian Daily, has been exposed.

    Ni Hongyi is an editor at the Dalian Daily. He advocated that the leadership of the Party newspaper should be handed over from the Communist Party. He said that the members of the newspaper's editorial board should be split equally between Party and non-Party members, and that the number of Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members among the staff should not be absolute. He argued that the person in charge of the newspaper did not necessarily have to be a Communist Party member.

    Since June 20th, all staff members of the Dalian Daily have held continuous meetings to refute the rightist Ni Hongyi's fallacy of attacking the Party newspaper and to expose his consistently anti-Party and anti-people ugly face. During the Anti-Japanese War, Ni Hongyi served as the Chief of the Publication Section in the Propaganda Department of the puppet Wang Jingwei regime. He compiled the "Anti-Communist Peace and National Construction Documents" and conducted long-term "clean-up the countryside" investigations, advocating that the Communist Party should be "attacked at its heart" and that "fortified villages" should be built.

    Wuhan Medical Community Criticizes Liu Nanshan

    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 8th: Medical workers in Wuhan held a forum yesterday to expose and criticize the reactionary words and deeds of rightist Liu Nanshan.

    Liu Nanshan is the president of Wuhan Tuberculosis Hospital and the director of the Tuberculosis Prevention and Treatment Institute. He attacked the Party, saying, "The Party understands nothing, can only spend money, and only specializes in destructive work." He also said, "Now it is northerners driving horse carts (referring to veteran cadres) leading senior intellectuals, which is an abnormal phenomenon." When lecturing students, Liu Nanshan publicly promoted the fallacy that "the more developed socialist industry is, the higher the incidence of tuberculosis will be." The meeting revealed that Liu Nanshan had been relying on the Kuomintang and American imperialist elements since before liberation, using medicine as a cover to carry out anti-people political activities. When he served as the Dean of Studies at Zhongzheng Medical College, he expelled more than 40 students on charges of being "red elements." Because of his loyalty to the reactionaries, he was valued by reactionary figures such as Soong Mei-ling, Chiang Ching-kuo, and Bai Chongxi and climbed to high positions.

    在反右派战线上
    右派骨干分子李静之开始认罪
    据新华社郑州7日电　民革河南省委委员、资产阶级右派骨干分子李静之开始认罪。
    李静之在整风运动中曾经连续三次去开封指挥民革开封市委负责人、右派分子宋聿修在社会人士中放火。他在开封亲自主持的一次座谈会上，与会的三十多人都是三反、肃反对象，被清洗分子以及其他对党不满的分子。并且在这些人的反党仇恨上做了火上浇油的工作。他还建议其他地方的民革组织照搬用他的这一放火经验。
    李静之在解放前历任伪南阳专署秘书长兼南阳“前锋报”社社长等职，参加过特务组织蓝衣社，因此，一直被当地统治势力奉为“军师”。
    目前，李静之已开始低头认罪正继续交代他和右派骨干分子刘积学、王毅斋等的关系。
    主张党报不要党的领导
    倪弘毅的谬论被驳倒了
    据新华社旅大7日电　旅大日报右派分子倪弘毅向党报进攻的阴谋已被揭露。
    倪弘毅是旅大日报的编辑。他主张把党报的领导权由共产党手中交出来。他说报社的编委会成员，应该党与非党各占半数，下面工作人员也不要共产党员和共青团员占绝对数量；报社负责人不一定要共产党员。
    6月20日以来，旅大日报全体工作人员连续集会，驳倒了右派分子倪弘毅向党报进攻的谬论，并揭开了他一贯反党反人民的丑恶面目。倪弘毅在抗日战争时期就在汉奸汪精卫的伪中宣部任出版科长，他编过“反共和平建国文献”，作过长期“清乡”调查，曾主张对共产党要“攻其心”和“坚壁清乡”等等。
    武汉医务界批判刘南山
    据新华社武汉8日电　武汉市医务工作者昨天举行座谈会，揭发和批判右派分子刘南山的反动言行。
    刘南山是武汉市结核病院院长、结核病防治所所长。他攻击党说，“党什么也不懂，只能出钱，只会专门作破坏工作”。又说，“现在是北方赶马车的（指老干部）领导高级知识分子，这是一种反常现象。”刘南山在向学生讲课时，曾公开宣传“社会主义工业越发达，结核病发病率越增长”的谬论。会上揭露：刘南山早在解放以前，就一直投靠国民党和美帝国主义分子，以医学为幌子来进行反人民的政治活动。在他担任中正医学院教务长时，曾以“赤色分子”的罪名开除了四十多个学生。由于他对反动派忠实，曾得到宋美龄、蒋经国、白崇禧等反动头子重视，爬上了高位。
