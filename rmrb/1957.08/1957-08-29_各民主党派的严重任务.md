    The Serious Task of All Democratic Parties
    In the current great socialist revolution struggle to criticize bourgeois rightists, all democratic parties are undergoing a serious historical test.
    A large number of leaders and members of democratic parties are among the anti-Communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist bourgeois rightists who have been exposed during the rectification process. Because of their political status, and because many of them are politically experienced, this group has played a backbone role in the rampant attacks of bourgeois rightists nationwide. They act as commanders and big and small bosses throughout the country, locally, or in one area or unit, planning, launching, calling for, and organizing rampant attacks against the Party, the people, and socialism.
    Of course, these people do not often formally and publicly declare their opposition to socialism. In our country, anyone who publicly exposes his anti-Communist and anti-socialist face will be completely isolated and bankrupt. Therefore, these rightists prefer to adopt cunning two-faced tactics, verbally supporting socialism, but actually negating the achievements of the socialist revolution and socialist construction, opposing various socialist systems, opposing various guidelines and policies for developing socialist undertakings, especially opposing the decisive factor in our socialist cause—the leadership of the Communist Party. They want the Communist Party to withdraw from here and there, and not to allow the Communist Party to put forward suggestions on guidelines, policies, and plans to the government, or to "issue orders" to the people. They use the principle of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision to make the democratic parties stand on an equal footing with the Communist Party and seize leadership. They oppose the ideological remolding of bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals, and praise, instigate, and use the capitalist sentiments of bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals to attack the Communist Party. They dream of creating a Hungarian incident in China, causing great chaos in the world, so as to come out to clean up the mess, replace it, and reverse the wheels of history on this land of China, so that capitalism can be restored. This wolfish ambition is now clear to the world.
    For the purpose of opposing Communism, opposing the people, and opposing socialism, this group of right-wing backbone elements adopted the organizational line of uniting bourgeois rightists, luring, deceiving, and instigating middle-of-the-roaders, and excluding and打击左派 (Dǎjí zuǒpài - cracking down on leftists). Under the guise of opposing sectarianism, they attacked and excluded leftists, and tried their best to seize the real power of the central and local leading organs of the democratic parties, and indeed many organizations have been completely or partially controlled by them. They also put up the banner of opposing closed-doorism, destroying the organizational policy of combining development and consolidation that the democratic parties have followed for many years, and using all bad means to "recruit troops and buy horses" in an attempt to create a so-called "strong mass base." The "mass base" they especially valued was all kinds of people who were dissatisfied with socialism and the Communist Party, those who had been sentenced and subjected to control, and other bad elements, the so-called "those whom the Party likes, they hate; those whom the Party hates, they like." During the rampant attacks, they implemented the so-called "joining the Party on the front line" and vigorously searched for these dissatisfied elements and bad elements. They also absorbed middle-of-the-roaders into the Party, but not to help them carry out socialist transformation, but to facilitate catering to, instigating, and supporting the backward side of the middle-of-the-roaders, and pulling them backward. The rightist organizational line is determined by and serves their reactionary political line of opposing Communism, opposing the people, and opposing socialism. Now, this reactionary organizational line is also being gradually revealed and known to many people.
    Of course, the severity of right-wing activities within the democratic parties is not the same. However, for a period of time, the right-wing line had a profound influence within the democratic parties; a part of the democratic parties, as a whole rather than locally, had the upper hand in the right-wing line. Therefore, for a period of time, many organizations of the democratic parties became legal tools for right-wing elements to attack the Party, the people, and socialism. It is precisely because of this serious situation that the democratic parties, in the national people's struggle to criticize the rightists, cannot but be subjected to a serious test, and must prove to the people that they can withstand this test. This serious situation is by no means accidental. The democratic parties are mainly the parties of the national bourgeoisie and their intellectuals. In the stage of democratic revolution and in the stage of socialist revolution, they cannot but centrally reflect the two-sidedness and political division of this class. Due to the historical and realistic conditions in our country, most of the people of this class can accept socialist transformation. However, this will inevitably be an acute and fierce class struggle, because the socialist revolution is fundamentally contrary to the nature and wishes of the bourgeoisie. This cannot but encounter resistance from many of them, and a part of them will inevitably carry out resolute resistance. In the past few years, it has already been seen that in the industrial and commercial circles, in the intellectual circles, and within the democratic parties, the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism is actually underway; it has already been seen that many people hope to maintain the "New Democratic Order" for a long time, so that "capitalism and socialism can each get what they want," which is actually not to promote the socialist revolution, but to allow capitalism to develop freely, so that China will gradually evolve into a bourgeois republic. Only because of the conditions at that time, this struggle was not launched and deepened, and was not prominent. After the upsurge of socialist transformation in 1956, profound and fundamental changes took place in the political situation in our country. We have basically eliminated capitalist ownership throughout the country, and the coexistence of five economic components has become the exclusive possession of the socialist economy. Bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals have lost their original economic foundation. "If the skin is gone, what will the hair attach to?" Only by attaching to the socialist economy, determined to change one's political position, and serving socialism can there be a way out and a bright future. Otherwise, making desperate struggles and plotting the restoration of capitalism is of course a dead end. Besides this, there is no middle road. Thus, among the bourgeoisie and bourgeois intellectuals, the struggle between the two roads has become a life-and-death struggle. It is this profound and fundamental social and historical change that has caused a new political division among the bourgeoisie and bourgeois intellectuals, and within the democratic parties, and has caused the reorganization of the three forces of the left, the middle, and the right. A small number of people have politically abandoned the capitalist stand and turned to the working class stand, firmly supporting socialism and the leadership of the Communist Party, and have become the left wing of the socialist revolution. This left wing has gradually formed and developed in the process of socialist transformation, and some of them have developed from the left-wing elements in the democratic revolution stage, and some have been transformed from the middle-of-the-roaders. Among the left-wing elements in the democratic revolution stage, some people became middle-of-the-roaders when they passed the socialist hurdle, and some became right-wing elements. The majority of bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals are still middle-of-the-roaders. On the one hand, they are inclined to accept the socialist road and the leadership of the Communist Party to varying degrees. After several years of education and study, they have already taken a step on the long journey from the capitalist stand to the working class stand, and may continue to accept transformation and move forward, and a small number of people have approached the left wing. However, on the other hand, they have basically not abandoned the capitalist stand, and always have many lingering memories of capitalism and the old world; they always have many dissatisfaction with the leadership of the Communist Party, the victory of socialism, and serving the workers and peasants; they always have many incompatibility with the new world. In this respect, they are connected with the right wing. Many people often regard right-wing elements as "confidants" and spokespersons. During the rampant attacks of the right wing, many people were instigated and deceived to varying degrees, sympathizing with and supporting the right wing. Because the middle-of-the-roaders who occupy the majority position accepted the influence and use of the right wing to varying degrees, the political face, political direction, and political line of many democratic parties were deeply affected by the right wing, and great confusion occurred. The bourgeois right wing is a small number of elements who adhere to the capitalist stand. The great historical leap of the upsurge of socialist transformation has made the capitalist economy in our country lose the conditions and active role for its existence. Under such circumstances, the bourgeois right wing who insist on the capitalist stand, launch rampant attacks on socialism, the working class, poor peasants and revolutionary intellectuals, and the Communist Party, are also reactionaries who attempt to reverse the course of history. They have antagonistic and irreconcilable life-and-death contradictions with the people.
    From a historical point of view, there are several types of right-wing elements in the democratic parties. One type is the advocates and supporters of the middle road in the stage of democratic revolution. The middle road is not to have the leadership of the Communist Party, but to engage in a bourgeois republic. Not all those who advocated and supported the middle road at that time are today's right-wing elements; some people have changed their positions, but the right-wing elements still adhere to this position. When the People's Liberation War had already achieved a decisive victory, they once conspired to oppose and stop the victory of the people, making the revolutionary war "stop at the right time," attempting to fish in troubled waters and engage in "three-way division of the world"; after the founding of the People's Republic of China, they continued to express dissatisfaction and resistance to the one-sided foreign policy, the land reform, the war to resist US aggression and aid Korea, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the three-anti and five-anti campaigns, and the five major movements of ideological transformation. One type of person originally belonged to the reactionary ruling group, and only came over to the side of the people around the victory of the people's revolution, but did not accept transformation. Some people are reactionary elements newly brought in by right-wing elements. These types of people are all veterans in opposing Communism and the people. Chairman Mao Zedong said at the Second Session of the First National Committee of the CPPCC in 1950: "War and land reform are the two 'hurdles' that test all the people and all parties in China during the historical period of the New Democracy." Now, the facts prove that these right-wing elements did not pass these two hurdles, or they mixed through with two-faced tactics, and when they reached the socialist hurdle, they revealed their true colors. There are also some people who passed these two hurdles and were not originally right-wing elements, but they could not pass the socialist revolution hurdle, and finally became anti-Communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist right-wing elements.
    The above situation shows that at this major historical juncture of the socialist revolution, the right wing launched a rampant attack, and the above-mentioned serious situation in the democratic parties in terms of politics and organization is not accidental, but has profound social class roots and historical roots, and is inevitable. To acknowledge the socialist road and the leadership of the Communist Party, and to wholeheartedly pass the socialist hurdle, is by no means an easy task for bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals, whether they are members of a party or non-party members. Now it seems that most of them are not wholeheartedly, but half-hearted. The bourgeois right wing is determined to rise up and conduct a contest with the working class, poor peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and the Communist Party, attempting to open the road for the restoration of capitalism. In many democratic parties, the right wing, in its contest with the working class, fully utilized the half-heartedness of the majority of bourgeois elements, bourgeois intellectuals, and democratic parties, and regarded them as their allies. Now that the outcome of this contest has been revealed, the majority of this class and its intellectuals and parties have begun to wake up and turn to the left. This contest is not only inevitable, but also a very good thing. After the contest, the right wing will fail, and the majority of people will gain lessons, and their consciousness will be improved, so it is possible to turn to wholeheartedly taking the socialist road. This is a major issue for the right wing and the people, and can only be made a big issue, not a small issue, let alone not made. And the right wing has already made it, how can the people not make it?
    Any political party itself is not an end, but a means to serve the economic base, either serving socialism or serving capitalism. The democratic parties can only coexist for a long time and supervise each other if they adapt themselves to the needs of the new socialist era and truly serve socialism. But as far as the current situation is concerned, the democratic parties are still bourgeois parties in general, and have not become a political force that truly serves socialism. There is a considerable distance here, that is to say, there is a major contradiction. To overcome this contradiction, it is necessary to carry out a fundamental self-transformation. This transformation is a fundamental transformation because it is an essential transformation from a bourgeois party to a socialist party. Although the right-wing elements oppose saying essential transformation, and oppose saying that there is an essential difference between the bourgeoisie and the working class, this is an irrefutable truth. It is now very clear how urgently this essential transformation is needed.
    What is the standard of transformation? In his article "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," Chairman Mao Zedong put forward six criteria for judging right and wrong, the most important of which are the socialist road and the leadership of the Communist Party. This is the fundamental standard in our country's political life, and naturally it is also the fundamental standard for the democratic parties to carry out self-transformation. The historical task of the democratic parties in the socialist revolution stage is to use these six criteria to carry out socialist education to the strata and people they represent and are connected with, and to promote and help them complete socialist self-transformation; they should not represent their capitalist tendencies and demands, that is to say, they should not represent their interests that violate the laws of historical development, but should only represent their interests that follow the laws of historical development. To this end, the democratic parties must conduct education of "destroying the capitalist stand and establishing the socialist stand" for their members, and carry out thorough transformation of individuals and collectives. At present, first of all, it is necessary to carry out a universal and in-depth rectification movement, thoroughly smash the right-wing group in the rectification movement, isolate and divide the right-wing elements, help most people in the middle state to draw a clear line with the right wing, and further transform the political stand. This is the current serious political task of the democratic parties. To complete the above-mentioned historical task and the current serious political task, the democratic parties must have a strong leading core that firmly stands on the socialist stand, and truly accept the leadership of the Communist Party. Facts have proved that without the leadership of the Communist Party, the democratic parties will inevitably lose their direction, run counter to socialism, and lose the trust of the people and the possibility of long-term existence. Only by truly serving socialism under the leadership of the Communist Party, relying on the left wing, uniting and educating the middle-of-the-roaders to move to the left, and isolating and dividing the right wing, is the only correct line and the only way out for the democratic parties, and can there be long-term coexistence and mutual supervision.
    All democratic parties have decided and have begun to carry out a rectification movement in their own organizations to criticize the right wing, destroy the capitalist stand, and establish the socialist stand. And criticizing the right wing is the main key and decisive step in the rectification movement, and is the turning point for the democratic parties to carry out fundamental transformation. Now the democratic parties have exposed and criticized a number of right-wing elements, thereby beginning to reverse the political direction, and enabling many members to receive profound socialist education in the struggle. This is a welcome phenomenon. However, the development of the struggle is still very uneven, especially most grassroots organizations have not yet launched the struggle. Therefore, the current urgent task of the democratic parties is to actively and step by step deepen the struggle to all grassroots organizations while continuing to deepen the struggle in the central and provincial and municipal leading organs. This is absolutely necessary in order to expose all right-wing elements, achieve a complete victory, deeply educate the broad masses of members from the struggle, and clarify the political face of grassroots organizations.
    In order to deepen the struggle to criticize the right wing, the rectification leadership of the democratic parties must have a firm stand. The fundamentally wrong stand that family scandals should not be publicized, and that evils should be tolerated, is a major obstacle to the struggle to criticize the right wing, and must be immediately and effectively reversed. When dividing and criticizing right-wing elements, it is necessary to accurately grasp the standard of whether they are anti-Communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist, and prevent misjudgment and mis-struggle. In the struggle, it is necessary to adhere to the method of debate, present the facts, reason things out, and allow right-wing elements to argue. The more truth is debated, the clearer it becomes. The more thorough the debate, the more it can educate and unite the majority, and isolate and divide the right wing.
    The democratic parties participated in the new democratic revolution in history. When the People's Republic of China was founded, they expressed their acceptance of the leadership of the Communist Party, supported the People's Government, and then expressed their support for the socialist cause, and did some work in uniting the national bourgeoisie and bourgeois intellectuals to accept socialist transformation. Under the conditions in our country, we believe that the majority of democratic parties will be willing to complete the current serious political task, will be willing to continue to carry out socialist transformation, and gradually change their political positions. As a result, the democratic parties will gradually be transformed into a political force that truly serves socialism, not only in name but also in reality, and will thus gain the trust of the people, and thus realize the Communist Party's desire for long-term coexistence and mutual supervision.

    各民主党派的严重任务
    在当前批判资产阶级右派的伟大的社会主义革命斗争中，各民主党派正在经历着一个严重的历史考验。
    在整风过程中暴露出来的反共反人民反社会主义的资产阶级右派分子，有一大批是民主党派的领导人员和成员。由于他们的这种政治地位，并且因为他们很多人是富有政治经验的，这班人在全国资产阶级右派的猖狂进攻中扮演了骨干作用。他们在全国、在地方上或者在一个方面、一个单位中充当主帅和大小头目，筹划、发动、号召和组织向党向人民向社会主义的猖狂进攻。
    当然，这班人并不常常正式地公开地宣布反对社会主义。在我们的国家中，不论任何人，只要公开暴露出反共反社会主义的面目，就要完全陷于孤立和破产。所以这班右派分子宁愿采取狡猾的两面手法，口里讲拥护社会主义，实际上一笔抹煞社会主义革命和社会主义建设的成就，反对各项社会主义的制度，反对发展社会主义事业的各项方针和政策，特别是反对我们的社会主义事业的决定因素——共产党的领导。他们要共产党退出这里、退出那里，不许共产党向政府提出方针、政策、计划的建议，向人民“发号施令”。他们利用长期共存、互相监督的方针，要使民主党派同共产党分庭抗礼，夺取领导权。他们反对资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子的思想改造，并且颂扬、煽动和利用资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子的资本主义情绪，向共产党进攻。他们梦想在中国制造匈牙利事件，天下大乱，以便出来收拾残局，取而代之，在中国这一块土地上扭转历史车轮，使资本主义复辟。这种狼子野心，现在是已经大白于天下了。
    为了反共反人民反社会主义的目的，这班右派骨干分子采取了团结资产阶级右派，笼络、蒙蔽、煽惑中间派，排斥、打击左派的组织路线。他们在反对宗派主义的幌子下，打击、排斥左派，竭力夺取各民主党派中央和地方领导机关的实权，并且确有许多组织已经被他们完全掌握或者部分地掌握了实权。他们又打起反对关门主义的幌子，破坏各民主党派行之多年的发展和巩固相结合的组织方针，而用尽一切恶劣手段，大肆“招兵买马”，企图造成所谓“强大的群众基础”。他们特别重视的“群众基础”，就是各种各式对社会主义和共产党心怀不满的分子，判过刑、受过管制的分子和其他坏分子，所谓“党所好者恶之，党所恶者好之”。他们在猖狂进攻中实行所谓“火线入党”，大肆搜罗这些不满分子和坏分子。他们也吸收中间分子入党，但不是为了帮助他们进行社会主义改造，而是为了便于迎合、煽动和支持中间分子的落后的一面，把他们拉向后转。右派的组织路线是为他们的反共反人民反社会主义的反动政治路线所决定，并为之服务的。现在，这条反动的组织路线也正在逐步揭露出来，为许多人所知道了。
    当然，各民主党派内部右派活动的严重程度是不相同的。但是，在一个时间内，右派路线在各民主党派内都有深刻的影响；一部分民主党派，就整体而不是就局部说来，右派路线曾经占了上风。因此，在一个时间内，各民主党派有许多组织都成了右派分子用来向党向人民向社会主义进攻的合法工具。正是由于这种严重的情况，各民主党派在全国人民批判右派的斗争中，就不能不受到严重的考验，就必须在人民群众前面证明它们经得起这个考验。这种严重情况决不是偶然发生的。各民主党派主要是民族资产阶级和他们的知识分子的政党，在民主革命阶段，在社会主义革命阶段，都不能不集中地反映这个阶级的两面性和政治分野。由于我国的历史和现实条件，这个阶级的大部分人是能够接受社会主义改造的。但是，这必然是一场尖锐而激烈的阶级斗争，因为社会主义革命毕竟是同资产阶级的本性和愿望根本相反的，这就不可能不遇到他们中的许多人的抵触，并且必然有一部分人要进行坚决的反抗。在过去几年中，人们就已经可以看得出，在工商界，在知识界，在民主党派内部，社会主义和资本主义的两条道路的斗争实际上已在进行；就已经看得见有许多人希望长期保持“新民主主义秩序”，使“资本主义和社会主义各得其所”，实际上就是不要推进社会主义革命，而让资本主义得以自由发展，使中国逐步演变成为资产阶级共和国。只是由于当时的条件，这种斗争没有展开和深入，没有突出。1956年社会主义改造的高潮到来以后，我国政治形势就发生了深刻的根本的变化。我们已在全国范围内基本上消灭了资本主义所有制，由五种经济成分并存变为社会主义经济独占。资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子丧失了原有的经济基础，“皮之不存，毛将焉附”？只有附着在社会主义经济上，决心改变自己的政治立场，为社会主义服务，才是出路，才有光明的前途。不然，作绝望的挣扎，阴谋资本主义复辟，这当然是死路一条。除此以外，中间道路是没有的。于是，在资产阶级和资产阶级知识分子中间，两条道路的斗争就成了死活的斗争。正是这个深刻的根本的社会历史变化，在资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子中，在民主党派内部，引起了新的政治分野，引起了左、中、右三种势力的重新改组。一小部分人在政治上抛弃了资本主义立场，转到工人阶级立场上来，坚决拥护社会主义和共产党领导，成为社会主义革命的左派。这个左派是在社会主义改造过程中逐渐形成和发展起来的，其中有一部分是从民主革命阶段的左派分子发展过来的，有一些是从中间分子转化过来的。在民主革命阶段的左派分子中，有一些人在过社会主义这一关的时候，变成了中间分子，个别的变成了右派分子。资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子的多数人仍是中间派。他们一方面是在不同程度上倾向于接受社会主义道路和共产党领导，经过几年来的教育和学习，他们在从资本主义立场到工人阶级立场转变的长途上已经开动了一步，还可能继续接受改造，向前进步，而且有一小部分人已经接近左派。但是，在另一方面，他们基本上还没有抛弃资本主义立场，对资本主义和旧世界总有许多念念不忘；对共产党的领导、社会主义胜利和为工农服务，总有许多不心服；对于新世界总有许多格格不入。在这个方面，他们是和右派相通的。不少人常常把右派分子引为“知己者”和代言人。在右派举行猖狂进攻的期间，更有许多人受了煽惑和蒙蔽，在不同程度上同情和支持右派。由于占多数地位的中间分子在不同程度上接受了右派的影响和利用，这就使得许多民主党派的政治面貌、政治方向和政治路线受到了右派的深刻影响，发生了很大的混乱。资产阶级右派是一小部分坚持资本主义立场的分子。社会主义改造高潮的伟大历史跃进，使资本主义经济在我国丧失了存在的条件和积极作用。在这种情况下，坚持资本主义立场、向社会主义向工人阶级贫苦农民和革命知识分子、向共产党举行猖狂进攻的资产阶级右派，也就是企图使历史开倒车的反动派，他们同人民具有对抗性的不可调和的你死我活的矛盾。
    各民主党派中的右派分子，从历史上看，有几种人。一种是民主革命阶段中间路线的倡导者和支持者。中间路线就是不要共产党领导，就是要搞资产阶级共和国。当时倡导和支持过中间路线的人，不都是今天的右派分子，有些人已经改变了立场，而右派分子却至今还坚持这个立场。他们在人民解放战争已经取得决定胜利的时候，曾经阴谋反对和阻止人民的胜利，使革命战争“适可而止”，企图混水摸鱼，搞“三分天下”；在中华人民共和国成立以后，对于一边倒的外交政策，对于土地改革、抗美援朝、镇压反革命分子、三反五反、思想改造五大运动，都继续表示不满和抵抗。一种人是本来属于反动统治集团，直到人民革命胜利前后才投到人民方面来，却没有接受改造的人物。有些人则是右派分子新拉进来的反动分子。这几种人都是反共反人民的老手。毛泽东主席在1950年政协第一届全国委员会第二次会议说过：“战争和土改是在新民主主义的历史时期内考验全中国一切人们、一切党派的两个‘关’”。现在，事实证明，这些右派分子对于这两个关就没有过来，或者是用两面手法混了过来，到了过社会主义这一关就现出了本相。也有一些人过了这两关，并且本来不是右派分子，但是他们过不了社会主义革命这一关，而终于成为反共反人民反社会主义的右派分子。
    上述种种情况说明了，在这个社会主义革命的重大历史关头，右派发动猖狂进攻，各民主党派在政治上和组织上出现上述的严重情况，都非事出偶然，都具有深刻的社会阶级根源和历史根源，都是不可避免地要发生的。承认社会主义道路和共产党领导，死心踏地过社会主义这一关，这对于资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子，不论是有党派的和无党派的，都决不是轻而易举的事。现在看来，他们中间的多数人不是死心踏地，而是三心两意。资产阶级右派则决心起来同工人阶级、贫苦农民、革命知识分子和共产党进行一场较量，企图为资本主义复辟打开道路。在许多民主党派中，右派在同工人阶级进行较量的时候，充分地利用了资产阶级分子、资产阶级知识分子和民主党派中多数人的三心两意，把他们当作自己的同盟者。现在这一场较量，胜负已见分晓，这个阶级及其知识分子和政党中的多数人已开始清醒过来，开始向左转了。这场较量不但是不可避免的，而且是一件很大的好事。经过较量，右派失败了，多数人就会获得教训，觉悟就会有所提高，因而有可能转向死心踏地走社会主义道路。这在右派方面，在人民方面，都是大题，只能大作，不能小作，更不能不作。并且右派已经作了，人民怎能不作？
    任何政党本身都不是目的，而是为经济基础服务的手段，不是为社会主义服务，就是为资本主义服务。各民主党派要能长期共存、互相监督，只有使自己适应社会主义新时代的需要，真正为社会主义服务。但是就现状说，各民主党派在总的方面还是资产阶级性的政党，还没有成为真正为社会主义服务的政治力量。这里有一个不小的距离，就是说有一个大矛盾。要克服这个矛盾，只有进行根本的自我改造。这一个改造之所以是根本的改造，因为是由资产阶级政党到社会主义政党的本质改造。尽管右派分子反对说本质的改造，反对说资产阶级和工人阶级之间有本质的区别，但这却是一个颠扑不破的真理。现在已经很明显，这种本质的改造是何等迫切需要。
    什么是改造的标准？毛泽东主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”一文中，提出了判别是非的六条标准，其中最重要的是社会主义道路和共产党领导两条。这是我国政治生活中的根本标准，自然也是各民主党派进行自我改造的根本标准。各民主党派在社会主义革命阶段的历史任务，就是要按这六条标准，去向他们所代表和联系的阶层和人民进行社会主义教育，推动和帮助他们完成社会主义的自我改造；而不应当去代表他们的资本主义的倾向和要求，就是说不应当代表他们违反历史发展规律的利益，而只应当代表他们遵循历史发展规律的利益。为此，各民主党派必须对自己的成员进行“破资本主义立场、立社会主义立场”的教育，对个人对集体进行彻底的改造，而目前，首先要进行普遍深入的整风运动，在整风运动中彻底粉碎右派集团，孤立、分化右派分子，帮助多数处于中间状态的人们同右派划清界限，进一步改造政治立场。这是各民主党派当前的严重政治任务。各民主党派要完成上述的历史任务和当前的严重政治任务，必须使自己有坚强的站稳社会主义立场的领导核心，并且真正接受共产党的领导。事实证明，离开了共产党的领导，各民主党派就必然要迷失方向，同社会主义背道而驰，失去人民的信任和长期存在的可能。只有真正在共产党领导下，依靠左派，团结和教育中间派向左走，孤立、分化右派，为社会主义服务，才是各民主党派唯一正确的路线和唯一的出路，才有长期共存和互相监督。
    各民主党派都已经决定并已经开始在自己的组织中进行批判右派、破资本主义立场、立社会主义立场的整风运动。而批判右派是整风运动的主要关键和决定性步骤，是各民主党派进行根本改造的转折点。现在各民主党派已经揭露和批判了一批右派分子，从而开始扭转了政治方向，并使许多成员在斗争中受到深刻的社会主义教育。这是值得欢迎的现象。但是斗争的发展还很不平衡，尤其是多数基层组织还未展开斗争。因此，各民主党派当前的迫切任务，就是要在中央和省、市领导机关继续深入斗争的同时，积极地和有步骤地把斗争深入到一切基层组织去。为了揭发一切右派分子，取得全胜，为了从斗争中深刻教育广大的成员，为了澄清基层组织的政治面貌，这是完全必要的。
    为了深入批判右派的斗争，各民主党派的整风领导必须有坚定的立场。认为家丑不可外扬，而姑息养奸，养痈贻患，这种根本错误的立场，是批判右派的斗争的重大障碍，必须立即切实扭转过来。在划分和批判右派分子的时候，必须准确掌握是否反共反人民反社会主义这一标准，防止错划和错斗。在斗争中要坚持辩论的方式，摆事实，讲道理，并允许右派分子进行辩驳。真理愈辩就愈明，愈是辩论得彻底，就愈能教育、团结大多数，孤立、分化右派。
    各民主党派在历史上参加过新民主主义革命。中华人民共和国成立的时候，它们表示接受共产党领导，拥护人民政府，随后又表示支持社会主义事业，并且在团结民族资产阶级和资产阶级知识分子接受社会主义改造方面，作了一定的工作。在我国的条件下，我们相信民主党派的多数人会愿意完成当前的严重政治任务，会愿意继续实行社会主义改造，逐步改变自己的政治立场。各民主党派也将因此逐步改造成为不是在名义上而是在实际上真正为社会主义服务的政治力量，因而获得人民的信任，因而实现共产党提出的长期共存、互相监督的愿望。
