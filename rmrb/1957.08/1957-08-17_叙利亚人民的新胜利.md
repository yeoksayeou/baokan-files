The Syrian government issued a statement on the 12th, stating that Syrian military authorities recently uncovered another major conspiracy case organized by American spies to subvert the current Syrian nationalist government. Most of the criminals involved in this conspiracy have been arrested. This is a new victory for the Syrian people in safeguarding their national independence and sovereignty.

According to the materials already published, this conspiracy aimed at overthrowing the current Syrian government was directly planned by the U.S. Embassy in Damascus. U.S. and French embassy personnel in Beirut also participated in this conspiracy. For this reason, the Syrian government has announced the expulsion of three American "diplomats" stationed in Damascus. At the same time, news from Cairo confirms that the anti-government conspiracy case uncovered in Egypt a few months ago was closely related to the U.S. Ambassador to Egypt, Hehl. The subversive activities carried out by the United States in Syria and Egypt undeniably demonstrate its deep hatred for the governments of Egypt and Syria, which uphold national independence and sovereignty.

The U.S. policy of aggression in the Middle East aims to comprehensively control Arab countries, seize the region's oil resources, and enslave the Arab nations. In order to realize this aggressive plan, the United States has adopted the method of dividing the unity of Arab countries and defeating them one by one. After the United States engineered a coup in Jordan and subverted the Nabousi nationalist government, it intensified its subversive activities against Syria and Egypt. The United States regards the nationalist regimes of Egypt and Syria as stumbling blocks to its aggressive policy in the Middle East, and is determined to remove them. In the past six months, the United States has plotted several subversive conspiracies against Syria. It is only because the Syrian people are highly vigilant and the nationalist forces are strong that these conspiracies manufactured by the United States have not succeeded. The United States has actually been planning this new subversive conspiracy for some time. Not long ago, the United States instigated Israel to carry out border provocations against Syria, artificially creating tensions between Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria, obviously to cooperate with the criminal activities of the conspiracy groups in Syria, attempting to coordinate internally and externally and bring down the Syrian nationalist government. At that time, the Associated Press revealed this Washington action plan. It said that the Syrian government "may face a major political turmoil," and "if the pro-Western group ousts Asali, it will effectively isolate Egypt in the Middle East." The recent U.S. focus on planning subversive activities against the current Syrian government is precisely to isolate Egypt in order to achieve its aggressive goal of breaking down the nationalist forces of Arab countries one by one.

In the U.S.'s so-called "Eisenhower Doctrine" aggressive plan in the Middle East, it insists that it is to maintain the peace and independence of Middle Eastern countries, and shamelessly says that it wants to "oppose subversive" activities in the Middle East. Now this wolf in sheep's clothing has been exposed. The facts revealed by Syria and Egypt once again prove beyond any doubt that it is none other than the American aggressors themselves who are carrying out subversive activities in Middle Eastern countries; it is none other than the U.S. government, which is crying "stop thief!" while committing the crime, that is painstakingly trying to undermine the peace and independence of Arab countries.

Although the subversive conspiracies planned by the United States in Syria and Egypt have been exposed, it will never give up. Syrian Minister of State Akil correctly pointed out: "What is revealed from this conspiracy is the beginning of a larger conspiracy, and we should maintain full vigilance to thwart any further attempts to undermine our freedom and independence." The US imperialism, which says nice things but does bad things, is today the most ferocious enemy of the Arab people in the Middle East. The exposure of its subversive conspiracies in Syria and Egypt will help the people of Arab countries to better recognize the face of this ferocious enemy, further increase vigilance, strengthen national unity, and fight to defend the independence and sovereignty of Arab countries.

### 叙利亚人民的新胜利

    叙利亚人民的新胜利
    叙利亚政府12日发表声明，叙利亚军事当局最近又破获了一件由美国间谍组织的、企图颠覆叙利亚民族主义现政府的大阴谋案。参预这个阴谋案件的大部分罪犯已经被逮捕。这是叙利亚人民维护自己民族独立和主权的新胜利。
    据已经公布的材料，这次目的在于推翻叙利亚现政府的阴谋，是驻大马士革的美国大使馆直接策划的。美国和法国驻贝鲁特的使馆人员也参加了这个阴谋。为此，叙利亚政府已经宣布驱逐驻大马士革的三名美国“外交官”。与此同时，开罗的消息证实，前几个月埃及破获的反政府阴谋案，是同美国驻埃大使赫尔有着密切关系的。美国在叙利亚和埃及进行的颠覆活动，无可辩驳地表明了它对于维护民族独立和主权的埃叙两国政府的刻骨仇恨。
    美国对中东的侵略政策，是企图全面控制阿拉伯国家，囊括这个地区的石油资源，奴役阿拉伯民族。美国为了实现这个侵略计划，采取了分裂阿拉伯国家团结、各个击破的办法。美国在约旦制造政变、颠覆了纳布西民族主义政府以后，就加紧了对叙利亚和埃及的颠覆活动。美国把埃、叙两国的民族主义政权，看作它在中东推行侵略政策的绊脚石，非要拔除它们而后快。在最近半年里，美国对于叙利亚便曾策划过几次颠覆阴谋。只是由于叙利亚人民警惕性很高，民族主义力量强大，美国所制造的这些阴谋才没有得逞。美国策划这次新的颠覆阴谋，实际上已经进行一些日子了。不久以前，美国曾唆使以色列对叙利亚进行边境挑衅，人为地制造了沙特阿拉伯、约旦、黎巴嫩和叙利亚之间的紧张事件，显然就是为了配合叙利亚国内阴谋集团的罪恶活动，企图内外策应，搞垮叙利亚民族主义政府。当时，美联社就曾透露了华盛顿的这个行动计划。它说，叙利亚政府“可能面临一次大的政治动乱”，而“要是亲西方集团把阿萨利撵下台去，就会使埃及在中东实际上陷于孤立”。美国最近一个时期集中力量策划对叙利亚现政府的颠覆活动，正是为了孤立埃及，以实现其各个击破阿拉伯国家民族主义力量的侵略目的。
    美国在中东推行的所谓“艾森豪威尔主义”的侵略计划中，硬说它是为了维护中东各国的和平与独立，并恬不知耻地说什么要在中东
  “反对颠覆”活动。现在这只披着羊皮的狼已经原形毕露了。叙利亚和埃及所揭露的事实，再一次千真万确地证明：在中东各国进行颠覆活动的不是别人，恰恰是美国侵略者自己；处心积虑地企图破坏阿拉伯各国的和平和独立的也不是别人，而恰恰是贼喊捉贼的美国政府。
    美国在叙利亚和埃及所策划的颠覆阴谋虽然已经败露，但它是绝不会死心的。叙利亚国务部长阿基勒就曾正确地指出：“从这个阴谋中揭露出来的是一个更大的阴谋的开端，我们应当保持充分的警惕，以粉碎任何破坏我们的自由和独立的进一步的尝试。”好话说尽，坏事做尽的美帝国主义，是今天中东阿拉伯国家人民的最凶恶的敌人。它在叙利亚和埃及制造颠覆阴谋的被揭穿，将有助于阿拉伯各国人民更加认清这个凶恶敌人的嘴脸，进一步提高警惕，加强民族团结，为保卫阿拉伯国家的独立和主权而斗争。
