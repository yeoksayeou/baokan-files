    London dispatch, August 2nd: The Disarmament Subcommittee meeting, originally scheduled for July 30th, has been repeatedly postponed because Dulles, after arriving in London, wanted to conduct behind-the-scenes consultations with other Western countries. The repeated postponements show that while the United States can rally other Western countries to obstruct a disarmament agreement, it is not easy for Dulles, Britain, and France to work out a joint strategy to delay negotiations so that they can shift the responsibility for not reaching an agreement to the Soviet Union at the end of the negotiations.

    In recent days, Dulles and British government leaders and Western representatives of the Disarmament Subcommittee have held a series of meetings. French Foreign Minister Pineau also made a special trip from Paris on August 1st to participate.

    According to British newspapers, Dulles's ideas are: First, to request a two-week extension of the London talks so that the United States can present its "new" proposals; second, to put forward a concrete "Open Skies" plan as a bargaining chip; and third, on the issue of ceasing nuclear weapons testing, to accept the US proposal that so-called suspension of military fissile material production should be a prerequisite. Britain and France have their own considerations regarding these specific US practices, believing that they are not as beneficial to them as they are to the United States. This has made it difficult to come up with a common plan for the time being.

    As a result of three days of activity, Western countries are said to have reached a consensus on extending the negotiation period, but they still harbor ulterior motives on the "Open Skies" and cessation of nuclear weapons testing issues. Therefore, according to Western news agencies, the so-called "new" US proposal, like an "endless story" from "Arabian Nights," will take another two weeks to be fully placed on the negotiating table.

    In recent days, American newspapers and news agencies have engaged in blatant propaganda, portraying Dulles as an envoy who has come to London specifically to "save" the disarmament negotiations, making it seem as if the United States is more active in disarmament than Britain and France. However, Reuters pointed out in its report that the fact that differences exist among Western countries does not mean that these differences are fundamental; these differences are merely about how to apply a position that has already been agreed upon. The agreed-upon position referred to here is the basic policy of Western countries to delay a disarmament agreement.

### 美英法共谋拖延裁军谈判  对开放天空和停止核试验问题仍各怀鬼胎

    美英法共谋拖延裁军谈判
    对开放天空和停止核试验问题仍各怀鬼胎
    本报伦敦2日电　原定在7月30日举行的裁军小组委员会会议，因为杜勒斯到伦敦后，要同其他西方国家进行幕后商谈，已经一再延期。一再延期的事实说明，美国虽然能够纠集其他西方国家一道阻挠裁军协议，但是杜勒斯和英法要磋商出一种拖延谈判的共同策略，以便在谈判结束时把没有达成协议的责任推给苏联，也并不容易。
    连日来，杜勒斯和英国政府首脑和裁军小组的西方代表，举行了一连串的会议。法国外长比诺，也在8月1日特地从巴黎赶来参加。
    据英国报纸透露，杜勒斯的主意是：一、要求将伦敦谈判再延长两个星期，以便美国提完它的“新”建议；二、提出一个“开放天空”的具体计划，作为谈判的资本；三、在停止核武器试验问题上，接受美国的以所谓中止军用裂变物质生产为先决条件的建议。对于美国的这些具体做法，英法有自己的考虑，认为对它们不如对美国有利。这就使得共同的方案一时拿不出来。
    经过三天活动的结果，西方国家在延长谈判期间这一点上，据说已经取得了一致的意见，但在“开放天空”和停止核武器试验问题上，仍然各怀鬼胎。因此，据西方国家通讯社报道说，美国的那个像“天方夜谈”里的“讲不完的故事”一样的所谓“新”建议，还要拖两个星期才能全部拿到谈判桌上来。
    这几天来，美国报纸和通讯社进行了一种露骨的宣传，把杜勒斯说成是特地到伦敦来“挽救”裁军谈判的使者，把美国说得似乎比英法对裁军要积极些。但是路透社在报道中指出，西方国家中存在分歧的事实并不意味这分歧是根本性的；这些分歧不过是关于如何运用一项已经一致同意的立场的。这里所指的一致立场，就是西方国家拖延裁军协议的基本政策。
