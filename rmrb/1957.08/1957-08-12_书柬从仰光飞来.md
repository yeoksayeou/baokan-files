    Letter from Rangoon flies in
     Han Yiping
  On a morning when small crimson flowers were in full bloom; a bundle of letters from my beloved arrived from Rangoon! The stationery still retained a rich fragrance, he said that he received care from foreign friends there, and a warm current seemed to flow gently in my heart; suddenly, a few lines of shining sentences
  flew into my eyes! The letter had excited faces, the letter had hundreds and thousands of beating hearts, Burmese friends said: Thank you! Thank you to the workers toiling under the high-temperature furnace! What we asked for, you did well
  and quickly! The spindles spinning with spring have already begun to spin! This is not a family letter from my beloved; it is a zither string summoning friendship in the morning
  vibrating! Thank you to the May wind for blowing this letter, so many hearts rush in the direction from which the letter came! The letter is the red thread that binds friendship, every heart is a guarantee of peace!

    书柬从仰光飞来
     韩忆萍在一个紫红色小花怒放的
  早晨；一束爱人的书柬从仰光寄来！书笺上还留着浓艳的香味，他说在那里受到外国朋友的
  关怀，我心里像有暖流轻轻流淌；突然几行闪着光彩的句子
  朝我眼底飞来！信上有一张张激动的脸，信上有千百颗跳动的心，缅甸朋友们说：感谢你们！感谢奔忙在高温炉下的工人！我们所要的你们做的又好
  又快！旋着春天的纱锭已飞旋起来！这不是爱人寄来的一封家信；是召唤着友谊的琴弦在清晨
  震荡！感谢五月的风吹来这封书柬，多少颗心沿着书柬飞来的方
  向奔去！书柬是缔结友爱的红丝，颗颗心都是和平的保证！
