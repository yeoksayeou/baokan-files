Xinhua News Agency, August 26th dispatch from Washington: The Washington Post published an article by Joseph Alsop on August 19th, pointing out the current anti-American sentiment and the phenomenon of the decline of the "Western Alliance" in Western countries.

Alsop said that American policymakers are now facing a serious problem: whether to let the "Western Alliance" decline into a loose alliance, or worse, into a clearly decorative façade. He said, "Those who have lived in Britain and France for a long time can clearly see the signs of this decline. These signs are numerous, such as the emergence of a vague but very nitpicking anti-American sentiment, a clear and widespread distrust of the current American leadership (including President Eisenhower himself), and an almost universal hatred of Secretary of State Dulles personally."

Alsop said that these phenomena showing Western disunity involve an extremely important practical issue: "The growing distrust of the American authorities is increasingly causing serious policy differences among Western allies." He said that the U.S. government "has made great efforts—especially Secretary of State Dulles has made great efforts—to gloss over the fundamental disunity and make it appear outwardly harmonious. But policy differences still exist. These differences are getting worse and worse."

Alsop believes that the reason why American leadership is now not trusted by its "allies" is because the Eisenhower administration is "completely unconcerned" about the central issues facing the British and French "allies."

Xinhua News Agency, August 26th dispatch from TASS, Washington, August 25th: "The Washington Post and Times Herald" published an article stating that Dr. Bernie, an expert in public opinion research, concluded after a two-week visit to Britain that "the British public is currently more hostile to the United States than in 1954—the heyday of McCarthyism… Among the British, there are many people with deeply rooted ideas. For example, some British people believe that: the United States is trying its best to undermine the British Commonwealth, the United States does not have an effective government, and all Americans are brazen and arrogant."

The article also emphasized that "relations between Americans and Canadians are also deteriorating... Here, open conflict also occurs due to deep divisions in trade and economic issues between the two countries."

　　反美情绪四起　西方联盟衰退
　　美国盟主众叛亲离
　　华盛顿邮报发出一片悲鸣声
    新华社26日讯　华盛顿消息：“华盛顿邮报”8月19日刊载了约瑟夫·艾尔索普的一篇文章，指出西方国家目前出现的反美情绪和“西方联盟”衰退的现象。
    艾尔索普说，美国决策人员目前开始面临一个严重问题，就是是否让“西方联盟”衰退为松弛的联盟，或者更坏，衰退为一个明显的装饰门面的东西。他说，“在英国和法国住过很长时间的人都能够明显看出这种衰退的迹象。这种迹象是很多的，例如出现了一种模糊的、但是非常爱挑毛病的反美情绪，人们对于美国现在的领导（包括艾森豪威尔总统本人）有一种明显而广泛的不信任，并且几乎普遍憎恨国务卿杜勒斯个人”。
    艾尔索普说，这些表明西方不团结的现象涉及一个极为重要的实际问题：“对美国当局越来越大的不信任，越来越引起西方盟国间的严重的政策分歧”。他说，美国政府“已经进行了极大的努力——特别是国务卿杜勒斯作了极大的努力——试图粉饰根本的不团结，使它外表看起来仿佛是协调式的。但是政策分歧仍然存在。这种分歧越来越恶化。”
    艾尔索普认为，美国领导现在之所以得不到它的“盟国”的信任，是因为艾森豪威尔政府对英法“盟国”面临的中心问题“完全不关心”。
    新华社26日讯　据塔斯社华盛顿25日讯：“华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”刊载一篇文章说，研究舆论问题的专家伯尔尼博士经过在英国的两个星期的访问以后得出结论说“英国公众目前对美国比在1954年——麦卡锡主义的全盛时期更加敌视……。在英国人中间有许多观念根深蒂固的人。例如，有的英国人认为：美国在极力拆英联邦的台，美国没有有效力的政府，所有美国人都是厚颜无耻和目空一切的人”。
    文章还强调指出，“美国人和加拿大人的关系也在恶化……在这里，发生公开冲突也是由于两国贸易和经济问题上的深刻分歧。”
