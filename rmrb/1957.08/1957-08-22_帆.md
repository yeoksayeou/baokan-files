Fable

　　Sail
　　Dong Yanshou
    The sail said to the mast: "Brother, you are too autocratic, tying me tightly to your body. Don't you allow me any freedom of movement?"
    The mast ignored it. The sail got extremely angry and roared: "This is too unfair! I am capable and can work independently. Why should I rely on you?"
    So the sail left the mast. Before it could even rejoice, the sea wind swept it away. The next morning, a fisherman捞 (lāo, to scoop up, dredge up) the sail from the water. The sail hung its head in dejection and cried to the mast: "Fine! You abandoned me. From now on, I will never cooperate with you again. Let's see how you move the ship!"
    The mast still ignored it. The sail dried its tears and looked. It discovered that its position had already been replaced by another sail.

　　帆
　　董延寿
    帆对船桅说：“老兄，你太专制了，紧紧地把我绑在身上，难道就不许我自由活动吗？”
    桅不理它。帆火极了，怒吼道：“这太不公平了，我有本领，能独立工作，为什么要依靠你呢？”
    于是帆离开了桅，它还来不及高兴，海风就把它卷走了。第二天早上，渔夫从水里把帆捞起来，帆垂头丧气，哭着对桅说：“好啊！你抛弃了我，从今以后，再不跟你合作了，看你怎样把船带走！”
    桅还是不理它。帆擦干眼泪，一瞧，发现它的位置已经被另一张帆代替了。
