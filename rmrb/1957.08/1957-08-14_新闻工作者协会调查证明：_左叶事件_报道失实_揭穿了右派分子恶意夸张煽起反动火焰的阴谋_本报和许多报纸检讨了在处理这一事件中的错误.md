Xinhua News Agency, 13th - In early May, many newspapers in Shanghai and Beijing published news and articles saying that Zuo Ye, Assistant Minister of Agriculture, verbally abused reporters at the Agricultural Exhibition on April 17th. Later, Zuo Ye himself, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Agricultural Exhibition all believed that this differed greatly from the facts. In order to clarify the truth, the All-China Journalists Association sent personnel to investigate all parties concerned and convened a special symposium on July 13 to investigate and analyze the matter. The symposium was presided over by Deng Tuo, President of the Journalists Association. Those present included Liu Ruilong, Vice Minister of Agriculture; Zuo Ye, Assistant Minister; Xi Fengzhou, Xia Ting, and Li Xing, other staff members of the Ministry of Agriculture; Xing Yi, Cui Liqun, Ye Chaolin, Qu Ningkang, and He Shanqing, staff members of the Agricultural Exhibition; Cai Zaidu of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Wang Mo of the News and Publication Department of the Propaganda Department; Yuan Shuipai and Gao Liang of the People's Daily; Wang Yuan of the Workers' Daily; Zhou You and Wang Yibo of the Beijing Daily; Wu Yikeng and Hong Ke of the China Youth Daily; Yao Fangzao of the Wenhui Daily; and more than twenty other people. One of the parties involved, Han Defu, a photographer from the Central Newsreel Film Studio, was away on business, and some other relevant personnel were not present. They all submitted written materials afterward.

At the meeting, Liu Ruilong, Vice Minister of Agriculture, gave a detailed introduction to the on-site situation of the Agricultural Exhibition and the Ministry of Agriculture's views after the incident occurred. He pointed out that previous reports in various newspapers differed greatly from the facts and should be investigated clearly.

Previous reports in various newspapers stated that Zuo Ye, Assistant Minister of Agriculture, cursed a photography reporter at the Agricultural Exhibition on April 17, saying: "Am I more important, or are you? If you squeeze any further, I'll tell you to get out!" The report also stated that later, a staff member of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs "conveyed someone else's order" to the reporters, saying: "Don't squeeze anymore. One comrade has already objected. If you squeeze any further, I'll tell all the reporters to get out!" At the symposium, Zuo Ye stated that he had not cursed reporters as reported in the newspapers. He read out his written self-criticism. He said that he was responsible for guiding foreign guests and maintaining order at the Agricultural Exhibition that day and was mentally stressed. When Han Defu, a photographer from the Central Newsreel Film Studio, tried to pull him away, he said, "Why are you acting like this? Is your attitude right? What do you do?" Han Defu said, "I am working!" Zuo Ye then said, "Is your work more important than mine?" He criticized himself for being impatient at the time and his tone being inappropriate. However, he stated that he did not say the phrase "If you squeeze any further, I'll tell you to get out."

Xi Fengzhou, Director of the Foreign Liaison Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture, Li Xing, Deputy Director of the Personnel Department, and Cui Liqun, Qu Ningkang, and Ye Chaolin, staff members of the Agricultural Exhibition, all said that they were present at the time and saw that Zuo Ye was indeed mentally stressed and impatient, and heard him say "Is your work more important than mine?" but did not hear him scold reporters or hear anything like "If you squeeze any further, I'll tell you to get out."

Cai Zaidu of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that he was the staff member of the Information Department mentioned in the newspapers, but he did not say anything about "conveying someone else's order." He did not even know who Zuo Ye was at the time.

Han Defu, one of the parties involved, said in a written statement that when he pulled Zuo Ye away that day, his film had already been shot. He pulled him because another photographer, Liu Yunbo, was working and the camera in his hand was only half a meter away from Zuo Ye's head. On the one hand, Zuo Ye was blocking the lens, and on the other hand, if he was not pulled away, his head would hit the camera. Han Defu said that Zuo Ye was very angry after being pulled and turned around and said, "Why are you pulling people?" Han said, "If I didn't pull you, the machine would hit your head." Zuo said angrily, "Am I more important, or are you?" Then he said something else, and Han said, "I didn't hear it very clearly at the time."

Several comrades from the Ministry of Agriculture and the Agricultural Exhibition said that China Youth Daily and Wenhui Daily sent the稿(gao - draft copy) to the Ministry of Agriculture to verify the facts before publishing the articles. However, when the Ministry of Agriculture raised objections and requested to clarify the facts before publishing, the two newspapers ignored them and hurriedly published the articles. The reporters also failed to investigate and verify with other relevant personnel who were present that day, such as comrades from the Agricultural Exhibition and the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, before and after writing the manuscript. It is hard to believe that they only listened to the one-sided words of individual reporters.

Deng Tuo, the new president of the Association, pointed out at the symposium that we cannot look at this matter in isolation. As everyone knows, this matter was exaggerated and sensationalized by right-wing elements in the news media, using it as a fuse to launch a political offensive against the people, against socialism, and against the leadership of the Communist Party. That is where its seriousness lies. Deng Tuo said that under the influence of the right-wing elements' intentional exaggeration, almost all newspapers made mistakes of varying degrees on this issue. Some comrades were biased and did not calm down and take a pragmatic attitude to verify the facts, ask the parties involved, ask the witnesses present, and analyze the nature of the matter, and then rashly criticized it, which had a very bad impact. Now everyone can see very clearly that Wenhui Daily's reports and editorials on this matter were used as a pretext to play up the issue and were ill-intentioned. In addition, most newspapers' reports on this matter violated the fundamental principle that news must be true, and objectively sided with the right-wing elements and played a role in fueling the flames. Deng Tuo said that the People's Daily also made mistakes on this issue. Yuan Shuipai of the People's Daily published a satirical poem on the People's Daily supplement on May 10, alluding to this incident, "Get Out of the Way, Bureaucratic Airs," without clarifying the facts. Yuan Shuipai read out his written self-criticism at the meeting. He said: "Without investigation and verification, I wrote this thing that actually added fuel to the fire for the bourgeois right-wing elements to attack the Party. I did not stand firm on the proletarian stand, the Party's stand, and wavered in the storm, doing something wrong that harmed the Party's interests. I am very regretful for the mistakes I have committed." Everyone expressed satisfaction with his self-criticism. Fang Cheng and Liang Ruhui, who published cartoons and essays related to this incident in the People's Daily supplement on May 10, also submitted written self-criticisms after the meeting. Fang Cheng said that his cartoon was actually satirizing Zuo Ye; the materials he based it on were neither comprehensive nor accurate, and he wantonly satirized it, resulting in slanderous attacks. He expressed his sincere apology to Comrade Zuo Ye. Liang Ruhui said that his essay "Learn to Respect People" made incorrect criticisms of Zuo Ye. Not only did he fail to investigate the facts clearly, but his attitude was not comradely at all, and he stubbornly argued that the reporter's work was more important at the time. All of these were wrong.

At the meeting, Wang Yibo, a reporter from the Beijing Daily, revealed that Liu Guanghua, a reporter from Wenhui Daily, the "arsonist" under Luo Longji and Pu Xixiu, was one of the reporters who participated in the interview at the Agricultural Exhibition that day. He said to Wang Yibo afterward: "This is outrageous. We must send a special telegram to Shanghai and write an editorial!" After Wenhui Daily published the news and inflammatory editorial about this incident on May 8, Wang Yibo met Liu Guanghua at the airport. Wang told Liu that Zuo Ye believed that it did not conform to the facts and wanted to sue. Liu Guanghua said in a contemptuous tone: "No matter how he sues, everyone knows it after it's published, and it can't be taken back. It's useless to sue to foreign countries. Anyway, we've already published it." It can be seen from the facts revealed by Wang Yibo that the right-wing elements' real intention was not the incident itself. They deliberately used such an untrue incident to attack the Party and the state, attempting to incite the news media to attack the Party's leadership, attack our state organs and various systems, and demand the restoration of the so-called "freedom of the press" of the bourgeoisie.

At the meeting, Wu Yikeng and Hong Ke of China Youth Daily, Wang Yuan of Workers' Daily, and Zhou You of Beijing Daily also made preliminary examinations or self-criticisms of the mistakes made by their individuals or their respective newspapers on this issue. Xinhua News Agency reported the news of Beijing and Shanghai newspapers attacking Zuo Ye without investigation, thus expanding the bad influence. Xinhua News Agency also made a written examination after this symposium. Deng Tuo suggested at the symposium that all newspapers should continue to examine the erroneous reports and remarks related to this matter, link this matter with other mistakes made during the period of the right-wing's rampant attacks, and use them as materials for self-education, so as to improve the ideological and political level of journalists, adhere to the socialist direction on the news front, and launch an irreconcilable struggle against the bourgeois right-wing elements.

    新闻工作者协会调查证明：
    “左叶事件”报道失实
    揭穿了右派分子恶意夸张煽起反动火焰的阴谋
    本报和许多报纸检讨了在处理这一事件中的错误
    新华社13日讯　5月初上海和北京许多报纸发表了新闻和文章，说农业部部长助理左叶在4月17日的农业展览会上辱骂了记者；后来左叶本人和农业部、农业展览会都认为与事实大有出入。为了弄清事情的真相，中华全国新闻工作者协会曾派员向有关各方进行调查，并在7月13日召集了一次专门座谈会，调查和分析了这件事情。这个座谈会由新闻工作者协会会长邓拓主持，到会的有农业部副部长刘瑞龙，部长助理左叶，农业部其他工作人员席凤洲、夏霆、李兴，农业展览会工作人员邢毅、崔力群、叶超麟、瞿宁康、何珊庆，外交部新闻司蔡再杜，中宣部新闻出版处王谟，人民日报袁水拍、高粮，工人日报王源，北京日报周游、王一波，中国青年报吴一铿、洪克，文汇报姚芳藻等二十余人。当事人之一的中央新闻纪录电影制片厂摄影师韩德福因公出差在外，还有一些有关人员未到会，事后都补写了书面材料。
    农业部副部长刘瑞龙在会上详细地介绍了农业展览会的现场情况和这件事情发生以后农业部方面的意见。他指出以前各报的报道与事实有很大出入，应该调查清楚。
    以前各报的报道说，农业部部长助理左叶在4月17日的农业展览会上骂摄影记者说：“你重要还是我重要！再挤就叫你们滚出去！”报上还说：后来，外交部新闻司的一位工作人员又对记者们“传达别人的命令”说：“你们别挤了，方才已经有一个同志有意见了，再挤就叫记者都滚出去！”在座谈会上，左叶声明，他没有像报上所说的那样骂过记者。他宣读了他的书面检讨。他说，他当天是负责为参观农业展览会的外宾带路和维持秩序的，精神比较紧张。当中央新闻纪录电影制片厂摄影师韩德福要把他拉开的时候，他曾说：“你怎么这样态度，你这个态度对吗？你是干什么的？”韩德福说：“我是干工作的！”左叶就说：“你的工作重要，还是我的工作重要？”他检讨自己当时态度急躁，说话的口气也不妥当。但是他声明确实没有说“再挤就叫你们滚出去”这一句话。
    农业部对外联络局局长席凤洲，人事司副司长李兴和农展会工作人员崔力群、瞿宁康、叶超麟都说，他们当时在场，看到左叶的精神紧张、态度急躁是事实，并且听他说过“你的工作重要，还是我的工作重要？”的话，但没有听到他骂记者，也没有听说“再挤就叫你们滚出去”这样的话。
    外交部新闻司的蔡再杜说，他就是报纸上所指的新闻司的一个工作人员，但是他并没有说“传达别人命令”的话，他当时还不知道左叶是谁。
    当事人韩德福在书面材料中说，他那天要拉开左叶的时候，他的胶片已经拍完，他之所以去拉，是因为另一摄影师刘云波正在工作，手中的摄影机距离左叶的头部只有半公尺，一方面左叶挡住了镜头，一方面如不拉开他，他的头就要碰到机器上了。韩德福说，左叶被拉后很生气，一回头就说：“你怎么拉人？”韩说：“不拉你，机器就要碰到你的头了。”左又气愤地说：“你重要还是我重要！”接着又说了一句什么话，韩说：“当时我听的不太清楚。”
    农业部和农展会的几个同志说，中国青年报和文汇报在文章发表之前，曾送稿到农业部去核对事实。但是，当农业部提出异议，要求弄清事实以后再发表的时候，两报都不加理会，就急急忙忙地发表了。记者写稿前后也并未向当日在场的其他有关人员，如农展会、外交部新闻司的同志去调查核对。像这样只听信个别记者的一面之词，就很难令人置信了。
    新协会长邓拓在座谈会上指出，我们不能孤立地来看这件事情。大家知道，这件事情是被新闻界右派分子加以夸大渲染，借以发动反对人民、反对社会主义、反对共产党领导的政治进攻的一个导火线，它的严重性就在这里。邓拓说，在右派分子有意夸大宣传的影响下，几乎所有的报纸都在这个问题上犯了不同程度的错误。有一些同志有偏激情绪，没有冷静下来采取实事求是的态度，去核对一下事实，问问当事的双方，问问在场的证人，分析一下事情的性质，就滥加批评，影响很坏。现在大家可以看得很清楚，文汇报关于这件事情的报道和社论是借题发挥，别有用心的；此外的大多数报纸对这件事情的报道也都违背了新闻必须真实这个根本的原则，并且在客观上替右派分子张目，起了推波助澜的作用。邓拓说，人民日报在这个问题上也犯了错误。人民日报的袁水拍曾在5月10日的人民日报副刊上发表影射这件事情的讽刺诗“官僚架子滚开”，也没有弄清事实。袁水拍在会上宣读了他的书面检讨。他说：“我不经调查核对，就写了这篇实际上为资产阶级右派分子向党进攻加添火力的东西。我没有站稳无产阶级立场、党的立场，在风浪中有了动摇，做了一件损害党的利益的错事，我非常痛悔我所犯的错误”。大家对他的检讨表示满意。在5月10日人民日报副刊上发表与这件事有关的漫画和杂文的方成和梁汝怀也在会后送来了书面检讨。方成说，他的漫画实际上是讽刺左叶的；根据的材料既不全面、又不确实，就乱加讽刺，结果变成诬蔑性的攻击。他表示诚恳地向左叶同志道歉。梁汝怀说，他写的“要学会尊重人”的杂文，对左叶进行了不正确的批评，不但未调查清楚事实，而且完全不是同志式的态度，还强词夺理硬说记者当时的工作更重要，这些都是错误的。
    会上，北京日报记者王一波揭露说，右派分子罗隆基、浦熙修手下的“放火凶手”文汇报记者刘光华是参加那天农展会采访的记者之一，他在事后对王一波说：“这事还了得，非向上海拍专电，写社论不可！”5月8日文汇报发表了这个事件的新闻和富有煽动性的社论以后，王一波又和刘光华在机场相遇，王告刘说，左叶认为与事实不符，要上告。刘光华用轻蔑的口吻说：“管他怎么告，登出来大家都知道了，收不回来。告到外国去也不管用，反正我们已经登了。”从王一波揭发的事实中可以看出：右派分子是醉翁之意不在酒，他们有意用这样一个并不真实的事件来向党和国家进攻，企图煽动新闻界起来攻击党的领导，攻击我们的国家机关和各种制度，要求恢复资产阶级的所谓“新闻自由”。
    在会上，中国青年报吴一铿、洪克，工人日报王源，北京日报周游也都分别对自己个人或所属的报纸在这个问题上所犯的错误进行了初步检查或自我批评。新华社没有经过调查，就报道了北京和上海报纸攻击左叶的新闻，因而扩大了不良的影响。这次座谈会以后，新华社也作了书面检查。邓拓在座谈会上建议各报应对有关这件事情的错误报道和言论继续进行检查，把这件事同其他在右派猖狂进攻时期所犯的错误联系在一起，作为自我教育的材料，以便提高新闻工作者的思想政治水平，在新闻战线上坚持社会主义的方向，跟资产阶级右派分子展开不调和的斗争。
