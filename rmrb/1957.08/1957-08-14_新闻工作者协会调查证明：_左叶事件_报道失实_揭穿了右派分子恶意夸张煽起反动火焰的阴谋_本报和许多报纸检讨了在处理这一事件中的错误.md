Xinhua News Agency, 13th - In early May, many newspapers in Shanghai and Beijing published news and articles saying that Zuo Ye, Assistant Minister of Agriculture, verbally abused reporters at the Agricultural Exhibition on April 17th. Later, Zuo Ye himself, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Agricultural Exhibition all believed that this differed greatly from the facts. In order to clarify the truth, the All-China Journalists Association sent personnel to investigate all parties concerned and convened a special symposium on July 13 to investigate and analyze the matter. The symposium was presided over by Deng Tuo, President of the Journalists Association. Those present included Liu Ruilong, Vice Minister of Agriculture; Zuo Ye, Assistant Minister; Xi Fengzhou, Xia Ting, and Li Xing, other staff members of the Ministry of Agriculture; Xing Yi, Cui Liqun, Ye Chaolin, Qu Ningkang, and He Shanqing, staff members of the Agricultural Exhibition; Cai Zaidu of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Wang Mo of the News and Publication Department of the Propaganda Department; Yuan Shuipai and Gao Liang of the People's Daily; Wang Yuan of the Workers' Daily; Zhou You and Wang Yibo of the Beijing Daily; Wu Yikeng and Hong Ke of the China Youth Daily; Yao Fangzao of the Wenhui Daily; and more than twenty other people. One of the parties involved, Han Defu, a photographer from the Central Newsreel Film Studio, was away on business, and some other relevant personnel were not present. They all submitted written materials afterward.

At the meeting, Liu Ruilong, Vice Minister of Agriculture, gave a detailed introduction to the on-site situation of the Agricultural Exhibition and the Ministry of Agriculture's views after the incident occurred. He pointed out that previous reports in various newspapers differed greatly from the facts and should be investigated clearly.

Previous reports in various newspapers stated that Zuo Ye, Assistant Minister of Agriculture, cursed a photography reporter at the Agricultural Exhibition on April 17, saying: "Am I more important, or are you? If you squeeze any further, I'll tell you to get out!" The report also stated that later, a staff member of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs "conveyed someone else's order" to the reporters, saying: "Don't squeeze anymore. One comrade has already objected. If you squeeze any further, I'll tell all the reporters to get out!" At the symposium, Zuo Ye stated that he had not cursed reporters as reported in the newspapers. He read out his written self-criticism. He said that he was responsible for guiding foreign guests and maintaining order at the Agricultural Exhibition that day and was mentally stressed. When Han Defu, a photographer from the Central Newsreel Film Studio, tried to pull him away, he said, "Why are you acting like this? Is your attitude right? What do you do?" Han Defu said, "I am working!" Zuo Ye then said, "Is your work more important than mine?" He criticized himself for being impatient at the time and his tone being inappropriate. However, he stated that he did not say the phrase "If you squeeze any further, I'll tell you to get out."

Xi Fengzhou, Director of the Foreign Liaison Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture, Li Xing, Deputy Director of the Personnel Department, and Cui Liqun, Qu Ningkang, and Ye Chaolin, staff members of the Agricultural Exhibition, all said that they were present at the time and saw that Zuo Ye was indeed mentally stressed and impatient, and heard him say "Is your work more important than mine?" but did not hear him scold reporters or hear anything like "If you squeeze any further, I'll tell you to get out."

Cai Zaidu of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that he was the staff member of the Information Department mentioned in the newspapers, but he did not say anything about "conveying someone else's order." He did not even know who Zuo Ye was at the time.

Han Defu, one of the parties involved, said in a written statement that when he pulled Zuo Ye away that day, his film had already been shot. He pulled him because another photographer, Liu Yunbo, was working and the camera in his hand was only half a meter away from Zuo Ye's head. On the one hand, Zuo Ye was blocking the lens, and on the other hand, if he was not pulled away, his head would hit the camera. Han Defu said that Zuo Ye was very angry after being pulled and turned around and said, "Why are you pulling people?" Han said, "If I didn't pull you, the machine would hit your head." Zuo said angrily, "Am I more important, or are you?" Then he said something else, and Han said, "I didn't hear it very clearly at the time."

Several comrades from the Ministry of Agriculture and the Agricultural Exhibition said that China Youth Daily and Wenhui Daily sent theç¨¿(gao - draft copy) to the Ministry of Agriculture to verify the facts before publishing the articles. However, when the Ministry of Agriculture raised objections and requested to clarify the facts before publishing, the two newspapers ignored them and hurriedly published the articles. The reporters also failed to investigate and verify with other relevant personnel who were present that day, such as comrades from the Agricultural Exhibition and the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, before and after writing the manuscript. It is hard to believe that they only listened to the one-sided words of individual reporters.

Deng Tuo, the new president of the Association, pointed out at the symposium that we cannot look at this matter in isolation. As everyone knows, this matter was exaggerated and sensationalized by right-wing elements in the news media, using it as a fuse to launch a political offensive against the people, against socialism, and against the leadership of the Communist Party. That is where its seriousness lies. Deng Tuo said that under the influence of the right-wing elements' intentional exaggeration, almost all newspapers made mistakes of varying degrees on this issue. Some comrades were biased and did not calm down and take a pragmatic attitude to verify the facts, ask the parties involved, ask the witnesses present, and analyze the nature of the matter, and then rashly criticized it, which had a very bad impact. Now everyone can see very clearly that Wenhui Daily's reports and editorials on this matter were used as a pretext to play up the issue and were ill-intentioned. In addition, most newspapers' reports on this matter violated the fundamental principle that news must be true, and objectively sided with the right-wing elements and played a role in fueling the flames. Deng Tuo said that the People's Daily also made mistakes on this issue. Yuan Shuipai of the People's Daily published a satirical poem on the People's Daily supplement on May 10, alluding to this incident, "Get Out of the Way, Bureaucratic Airs," without clarifying the facts. Yuan Shuipai read out his written self-criticism at the meeting. He said: "Without investigation and verification, I wrote this thing that actually added fuel to the fire for the bourgeois right-wing elements to attack the Party. I did not stand firm on the proletarian stand, the Party's stand, and wavered in the storm, doing something wrong that harmed the Party's interests. I am very regretful for the mistakes I have committed." Everyone expressed satisfaction with his self-criticism. Fang Cheng and Liang Ruhui, who published cartoons and essays related to this incident in the People's Daily supplement on May 10, also submitted written self-criticisms after the meeting. Fang Cheng said that his cartoon was actually satirizing Zuo Ye; the materials he based it on were neither comprehensive nor accurate, and he wantonly satirized it, resulting in slanderous attacks. He expressed his sincere apology to Comrade Zuo Ye. Liang Ruhui said that his essay "Learn to Respect People" made incorrect criticisms of Zuo Ye. Not only did he fail to investigate the facts clearly, but his attitude was not comradely at all, and he stubbornly argued that the reporter's work was more important at the time. All of these were wrong.

At the meeting, Wang Yibo, a reporter from the Beijing Daily, revealed that Liu Guanghua, a reporter from Wenhui Daily, the "arsonist" under Luo Longji and Pu Xixiu, was one of the reporters who participated in the interview at the Agricultural Exhibition that day. He said to Wang Yibo afterward: "This is outrageous. We must send a special telegram to Shanghai and write an editorial!" After Wenhui Daily published the news and inflammatory editorial about this incident on May 8, Wang Yibo met Liu Guanghua at the airport. Wang told Liu that Zuo Ye believed that it did not conform to the facts and wanted to sue. Liu Guanghua said in a contemptuous tone: "No matter how he sues, everyone knows it after it's published, and it can't be taken back. It's useless to sue to foreign countries. Anyway, we've already published it." It can be seen from the facts revealed by Wang Yibo that the right-wing elements' real intention was not the incident itself. They deliberately used such an untrue incident to attack the Party and the state, attempting to incite the news media to attack the Party's leadership, attack our state organs and various systems, and demand the restoration of the so-called "freedom of the press" of the bourgeoisie.

At the meeting, Wu Yikeng and Hong Ke of China Youth Daily, Wang Yuan of Workers' Daily, and Zhou You of Beijing Daily also made preliminary examinations or self-criticisms of the mistakes made by their individuals or their respective newspapers on this issue. Xinhua News Agency reported the news of Beijing and Shanghai newspapers attacking Zuo Ye without investigation, thus expanding the bad influence. Xinhua News Agency also made a written examination after this symposium. Deng Tuo suggested at the symposium that all newspapers should continue to examine the erroneous reports and remarks related to this matter, link this matter with other mistakes made during the period of the right-wing's rampant attacks, and use them as materials for self-education, so as to improve the ideological and political level of journalists, adhere to the socialist direction on the news front, and launch an irreconcilable struggle against the bourgeois right-wing elements.
