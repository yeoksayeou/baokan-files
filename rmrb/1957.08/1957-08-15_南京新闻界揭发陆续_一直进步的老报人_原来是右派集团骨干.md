Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing Electric Dispatch: Lu Xu, the reporter stationed in Nanjing for Wenhui Daily and a rightist element, has had his true face of anti-Communist Party and anti-socialism further exposed.

According to exposures from various sources and Lu Xu's own confessions, he was a backbone member of the upper-level rightist group of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party Jiangsu Provincial Committee. He had connections with the rightist leaders of the local organizations of the Jiusan Society, the China Democratic League, and the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and frequented their "secret chambers." During the period of blooming and contending, in addition to setting fires everywhere in cultural circles, Lu Xu also attracted a group of rightist elements and people dissatisfied with the Party to prepare for the formation of a "magazine of like-minded people," with Lu Xu serving as "manager," preparing to counter the publications led by the Communist Party. Lu Xu also colluded with rightist elements from Xinhua Daily, Cultural News, and Jiangsu and Nanjing People's Broadcasting Stations, preparing to work together from the inside and outside to break through the Party's news media fortress. They even discussed the "management principles" and "layout arrangements" once the Party newspaper "Cultural News" fell into their hands in the future.

It was revealed that Lu Xu sought out people with serious individualism and dissatisfaction with the Communist Party in various news organizations. Then, using methods such as flattery, praise, cajoling, and enticement, he tried his best to drag those he had found into the water and incited some of them to leave the Party newspaper. Representatives from Wenhui Daily and the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party also attended the meeting to expose the relationship between Lu Xu and rightist leaders such as Xu Zhucheng. People also revealed that Lu Xu had frequently distorted and slandered the Communist Party's policies in previous political movements before the great blooming and contending. He said that the "Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries" movement was "destroying the essence" and slandered cadre study as "spiritual trials."

Attendees also exposed the truth behind Lu Xu's self-bragging about his "democratic history" and that he was an "always progressive veteran journalist."

    南京新闻界揭发陆续
    “一直进步的老报人”原来是右派集团骨干
    据新华社南京电　文汇报驻南京记者、右派分子陆续的反共产党反社会主义的真面目已被进一步揭露出来了。
    根据各方面的揭发和陆续自己的交代，他是农工民主党江苏省委上层右派集团的一个骨干，同九三学社、民盟、民革的地方组织的右派头目都有联系，曾出入于这些人的“密室”。鸣放期间，陆续除在文化界到处放火外，并拉拢一批右派分子和对党不满的人筹组“同人刊物”，陆续自任“经理”，准备同共产党领导的刊物唱对台戏。陆续还同新华日报、文化新闻以及江苏和南京人民广播电台的右派分子勾结一起，准备里应外合攻破党的新闻事业堡垒。他们甚至已商量好当党报“文化新闻”将来一旦落入他们手里后的“经营方针”和“版面安排”。
    据揭露陆续在各新闻单位物色有严重个人主义和对共产党不满的人，然后利用吹、捧、拍、拉拢和利诱等办法，尽力把他物色的人拖下水，并煽动其中一些人离开党报。文汇报和农工民主党也派代表到会上揭发了陆续和徐铸成等右派头子的关系。人们还揭发出陆续在大鸣大放前的历次政治运动中，就经常歪曲和诬蔑共产党的政策。他说“肃反”运动是“摧残精华”，诬蔑干部学习是“精神审判”。
    到会的人又揭穿了陆续曾自我吹嘘他的“民主历史”和他是“一直进步的老报人”的真相。
