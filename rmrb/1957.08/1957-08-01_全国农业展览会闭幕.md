The National Agricultural Exhibition held in the capital concluded victoriously on July 31st, after receiving its final batch of visitors.

Over the five months from its official opening on February 20th, the exhibition welcomed over 2.2 million visitors. During this time, in addition to nearly 50,000 representatives from professional visiting groups from provinces, cities, and districts across the country, the exhibition also received the Soviet delegation visiting the Chinese Agricultural Exhibition, as well as over 6,000 foreign guests from more than fifty countries including Japan and India.

Visitors unanimously reflected that the exhibition, the first large-scale national agricultural exhibition in our country, was a success with tremendous achievements. It not only reflected our country's extremely rich agricultural resources and provided a vivid patriotic education for all visitors, but also showcased the great achievements made in our country's agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, aquaculture, meteorology, and other fields since liberation, deeply impressing people with the fact that our motherland has become even greater and more lovable. Through various high-yield typical examples of agricultural crops, the exhibition reflected the tremendous potential of our agricultural production through the significant role played by various technical reforms and increased production measures implemented by the state in agricultural production over the past few years; further proving that our country's main approach to developing agricultural production at this stage, which is to increase yield per unit area, is completely correct. Every part of the National Agricultural Exhibition powerfully demonstrated that agricultural cooperativization is the fundamental reason for the rapid development of various economic construction undertakings in our rural areas, thereby further inspiring people's confidence in moving forward towards socialism.

In order to further and deeply tap the potential of our agricultural production, further promote the high tide of our agricultural production, and thoroughly fulfill the arduous tasks of our country's agricultural development program, all the representatives from the visiting groups from various provinces, cities, and districts, while carefully viewing the exhibits in each hall, also actively participated in various technical exchange activities held by the National Agricultural Exhibition for them. These activities not only helped representatives from various regions overcome many kinds of conservative ideas and complacency, and improved their confidence in increasing production, but also played a practical role in striving for a bumper agricultural harvest this year.

After returning, representatives from various provinces, cities, and districts promoted various advanced experience in increasing production exhibited at the exhibition according to local conditions. For example, after visiting the Sichuan Xiguang Cooperative's experience of nine vegetable harvests a year showcased in the Crop Hall 2, the visiting representatives from the eight garden field cooperatives in the Hexi District of Tianjin City, compared it with the production methods in their own area, and decided to change from five harvests a year to seven harvests, and specifically arranged the crop rotation. Now, all regions are continuing to spread and promote the various achievements and experiences exhibited at the agricultural exhibition.

In order to continue to disseminate and exchange advanced agricultural production experience and agricultural scientific and technological knowledge, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation, the Ministry of Forestry, the Ministry of Water Conservancy, the Ministry of Aquatic Products, and the Meteorological Bureau will jointly establish a permanent agricultural exhibition hall in Beijing.

    全国农业展览会闭幕
    本报讯　在首都举行的全国农业展览会，7月31日接待最后一批观众，并且宣告胜利闭幕。
    展览会从2月20日正式开馆到现在的五个多月时间里面，观众达二百二十多万人次。在展览期间，展览会除了接待了全国各省、市、区，将近五万名专业参观团的代表以外，还接待了苏联参观中国农业展览会代表团以及日本、印度等五十多个国家的六千多名外宾。
    观众们一致反映，我国首次规模巨大的全国农业展览会的展出是成功的，成绩是巨大的。它不但反映了我国极其丰富的农产资源，对所有的观众进行了一次生动的爱国主义教育，同时还显示了解放以来我国的农业、林业、水利、水产、气象等方面的巨大成就，使人们深深地感到祖国变得更加伟大可爱。全国农业展览会通过各种农作物的高额丰产典型、几年来国家在农业生产上实行的各种技术改革和各种增产措施所起的巨大作用，反映了我国农业生产的巨大潜力；进一步证明了我国以提高单位面积产量为现阶段发展农业生产的主要途径是完全正确的。全国农业展览会的每个部分都有力地证明了，农业合作化是我国农村各项经济建设事业获得突飞猛进发展的根本原因，从而进一步鼓舞了人们向社会主义前进的信心。
    为了更加深广地挖掘我国农业生产潜力、进一步推动我国农业生产的高涨，彻底实现我国农业发展纲要的艰巨任务，所有来自各省、市、区的参观团的代表们，在仔细地看了各馆的展出同时，还认真地参加了全国农业展览会为他们举办的各种各样的技术交流活动。这些活动使各地的代表们不但克服了许多各色各样的保守思想和自满情绪，提高了增产的信心，并且对争取今年农业大丰收起到实际的推动作用。
    各省、市、区的代表们回去之后，都因地制宜地推广了展览会展出的各种增产典型经验。例如天津市河西区八个园田社的参观代表，参观了农作物二馆展出的四川省西光社蔬菜一年九熟的经验以后，对照了本地区的生产方法，决定改一年五熟为七熟，并且具体地安排了茬口。现在各地正在继续传播和推广农展会展出的各项成就和经验。
    为了继续传播、交流农业生产先进经验和农业科学技术知识，农业部、农垦部、林业部、水利部、水产部和气象局，将在北京共同筹建一个长期性的农业展览馆。　（胡曙）
