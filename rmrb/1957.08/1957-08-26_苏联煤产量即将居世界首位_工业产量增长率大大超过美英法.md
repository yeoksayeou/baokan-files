　　Soviet Coal Production About to Rank First in the World
　　Industrial Production Growth Rate Greatly Exceeds that of the US, Britain, and France
    This Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Moscow, August 25th: Soviet industry's lifeblood—coal production—is rushing towards a lofty goal: to exceed all other countries in the world, including the United States, by 1960, reaching an annual production of 593 million tons. In the first seven months of this year, Soviet coal mining exceeded the same period last year by 21 million tons. The production capacity of coal-producing areas across the country is constantly improving. In the Donbas region alone, 67 new mines are under construction, 35 of which are being built by more than 70,000 members of the Komsomol and young people from Ukraine. Three of these mines have already been put into operation today, four months ahead of schedule. Miners have launched a competition to welcome the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution. Kuzbass miners had pledged to overproduce 500,000 tons of coal this year, a pledge that was fulfilled today more than four months ahead of schedule. Now, they are continuing their efforts to overproduce 800,000 tons of coal this year.

    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 25th: During the Soviet era, Soviet industrial output has increased more than 30 times, while the production of means of production has increased 67 times. If calculated per capita, from 1913 to 1956, Soviet industrial output increased 21 times, while the United States only increased 2.4 times, France increased 1.7 times, and Britain increased 1.6 times. As for per capita production of consumer goods, the United States increased 1.5 times during this period, while the Soviet Union increased 8.2 times.

    This was mentioned in a long article published by Belyayev, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, in "Pravda" on August 24th.

　　苏联煤产量即将居世界首位
　　工业产量增长率大大超过美英法
    本报莫斯科25日电　苏联工业的粮食——煤的生产朝着崇高的目标飞奔猛进，这就是在1960年要超过世界上任何国家包括美国在内，达到年产五亿九千三百万吨。今年头七个月，苏联采煤量超过去年同期二千一百万吨。全国产煤区的生产能力不断提高着。仅仅一个顿巴斯就在建筑六十七座新矿，其中三十五座是由乌克兰七万多共青团员和青年动手建筑的，有三座已经提前四个月在今天投入生产。矿工展开了迎接十月革命四十周年的竞赛。库兹巴斯矿工曾经保证今年超计划增产五十万吨煤，这个保证提前四个多月在今天实现了，现在他们再接再厉，争取今年超计划增产八十万吨煤。
    据新华社莫斯科25日电　在苏维埃政权年代，苏联的工业产量增加到三十倍以上，而生产资料的生产量增加到六十七倍，如果按人口平均计算，从1913年到1956年苏联的工业产量增加到二十一倍，而美国仅仅增加到二点四倍，法国增加到一点七倍，英国增加到一点六倍。至于说到按人口平均计算的消费品生产量，美国这一时期增加到一倍半，而苏联增加到八点二倍。
    这是苏联共产党中央委员会书记别利亚耶夫8月24日在“真理报”上发表的一篇长文章中谈到的。
