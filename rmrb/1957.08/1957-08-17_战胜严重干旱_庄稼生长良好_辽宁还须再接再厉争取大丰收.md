    Overcoming Severe Drought, Crops Growing Well
    Liaoning Still Needs to Make Further Efforts to Achieve a Bumper Harvest
    (Our reporter Lu Hao reports): On the agricultural front in Liaoning Province, a major victory has recently been achieved in the arduous struggle to combat drought and protect seedlings.
    This year, many parts of Liaoning Province have experienced severe drought. In the twelve coastal counties and cities, there was no substantial rain for two and a half months. According to statistics from thirty-eight counties, over 6.9 million mu of cultivated land was planted while combating the drought.
    The scale of this drought-resistance and seedling protection campaign is unprecedented. The Liaoning Provincial People's Committee established a drought resistance command, led by vice governors, heads of departments and bureaus, and other responsible cadres at all levels, leading more than 20 work groups to various counties to guide and assist in drought resistance work. Cadres of local government agencies, enterprise employees, school teachers and students, and the military also went to the countryside. According to statistics from forty counties, the number of people participating in the drought resistance struggle in rural areas reached more than 536,000. People worked day and night, digging ditches to divert water, plowing and planting, digging riverbeds, exploring springs, and doing everything possible to fight the drought. In Zhuanghe County, people dug a total of more than 1,700 li of riverbed to raise the water level. In Yingkou County, more than 60,000 mu of field crops were artificially watered to replant seedlings, and more than 40,000 mu were replanted due to uneven seedling emergence.
    Through the struggle against drought, agricultural cooperatives have been further consolidated. Some people who originally wanted to withdraw from the cooperatives did not withdraw, and those who had already withdrawn repeatedly requested to join the cooperatives again. According to statistics, more than 12,000 more peasant households joined the cooperatives this year, bringing the total number of peasant households in cooperatives in the province to 98.7%.
    The major victory in Liaoning Province's drought resistance struggle has basically ensured the completion of this year's planting plan for the entire province. Except for cotton, peanuts, and rice, which did not complete the original plan, the planting plans for other crops have been nearly completed or overfulfilled. Now, the growth of field crops is good, and a bumper harvest is very promising. However, it is worth noting that due to the major victory in the drought resistance struggle and the good growth of crops, a blindly optimistic mood is emerging in some agricultural cooperatives. They think that such a major drought has been conquered, so what problems can there be with a bumper harvest? As a result, the phenomenon of eating and drinking excessively has occurred. Recently, an agricultural cooperative in Suizhong County slaughtered thirteen pigs in one day; an agricultural cooperative in Faku County had three consecutive meals together. In some places, there is a sense of paralysis regarding the disasters that may occur at present. In Yi County, aphids spread in 390 mu of sorghum fields in two townships, and as a result, they could not be rescued.
    It should be pointed out that although from the current point of view, Liaoning's hope for a bumper harvest is great, the current rural areas are in a season of multiple disasters. Recently, insect plagues have occurred one after another, and the situation is quite serious. This year, the planting area of sorghum in Liaoning reached 19.5 million mu, and aphids are currently quite common. If they are not urgently eradicated, it will undoubtedly be a serious blow to the effort to achieve a bumper harvest. At the same time, the flood season has arrived. Due to the previous drought, the current concentration of rainfall is very high, so we must be very vigilant about the occurrence of floods. The average area of cultivated land affected by waterlogging in Liaoning Province every year is about 3 million mu. In the past few days, heavy rain has fallen in southern Liaoning, and 300,000 mu of land has already formed inland water. If there is more heavy rainfall, the disaster will inevitably expand, so any negligence in this regard will lead to serious losses.
    This year's planting is relatively late, and field crops are easily attacked by frost. This is also a problem worth noting. Some people think that this year is a leap August, the solar terms are late, and they are not afraid of frost. This idea is harmful. From now on, we must continue to grasp field management and take all measures to promote the growth of field crops and make them mature early. This is still an extremely complex and meticulous task in the entire province. In short, in order to strive for this year's bumper harvest, the agricultural front in Liaoning must continue to make persistent efforts and conduct a serious battle with nature.

### 战胜严重干旱  庄稼生长良好  辽宁还须再接再厉争取大丰收

    战胜严重干旱  庄稼生长良好
    辽宁还须再接再厉争取大丰收
    本报讯  记者陆灏报道：辽宁省的农业战线上，最近，在抗旱保苗的艰巨斗争中取得了一场重大的胜利。
    今年辽宁省很多地方遇上了大旱，像沿海十二个县、市，竟持续两个半月未下透雨。据三十八个县统计，抗旱播种的耕地共达六百九十余万亩。
    这一场抗旱保苗斗争的规模是空前的。辽宁省人民委员会成立了抗旱指挥部，由副省长、厅、局长等各级负责干部率领了二十多个工作组，分赴各县指导和帮助抗旱工作。各地机关干部、企业职工、学校师生和军队也都纷纷下乡。据四十个县统计，此次投入农村参加抗旱斗争的人数达到五十三万六千多人。人们昼夜不息，开沟引水，掏墒抢种，挖河底，探泉眼，千方百计地和干旱进行斗争。在庄河县人们为使水位上涨，共挖河身长达一千七百余里。营口县，人工浇水补苗的大田作物就有六万多亩，因为出苗不齐毁了重种的也有四万多亩。
    经过了抗旱斗争，农业社更加巩固了。有些原来要想退社的不退社了，已经退社的又一再请求入社。据统计，今年又有一万二千多户农民加入了合作社，全省入社总农户达到了98.7％。
    辽宁省抗旱斗争的重大胜利，基本上保证完成了今年全省的播种计划。全省除棉花、花生、水稻没有完成原订的计划外，其他作物的播种计划均接近完成或超额完成了。现在，大田作物的生长情况良好，丰收大有希望。但值得注意的是：由于抗旱斗争取得了重大胜利，庄稼生长得不错，在部分农业社中正产生一种盲目乐观的情绪。他们以为这样大的旱灾都已经被征服了，丰收还会有什么问题？于是大吃大喝的现象发生了。最近绥中县有个农业社，一天杀了十三口猪；法库县一个农业社连着会餐了三次。有些地方，对于目前可能发生的灾情发生了麻痹思想。义县就有两个乡在三百九十亩高粱地里蚜虫蔓延，结果无法抢救。
    应当指出：虽然从现在来看，辽宁的丰收希望很大，但当前农村正处在多灾的季节。最近虫灾此起彼伏，情况相当严重。今年辽宁高粱的播种面积达一千九百五十万亩，目前蚜虫相当普遍，如不紧急扑灭，对于争取丰收无疑是个严重的打击。同时，汛期已到，由于前期干旱，现在雨水集中量很大，因此就必须十分警惕水灾的发生。辽宁全省每年平均内涝耕地面积大约是三百万亩左右。这几天辽南地区普降暴雨，已有三十万亩地形成内水。如再继续有大的雨量，灾害势必扩大，因此这方面的任何疏忽，都将遭致严重的损失。
    今年播种较迟，大田作物很容易受到寒霜的袭击。这也是一个值得注意的问题。有些人认为今年闰8月，节气晚，不怕霜，这种想法是有害的。从现在起就继续抓紧田间管理，采取一切措施促进大田作物的生育，使其早熟，这在全省还是一件极为复杂细致的工作。总而言之，争取今年的丰收，在当前辽宁的农业战线上还必须再接再厉，和自然界进行一场严重的战斗。
