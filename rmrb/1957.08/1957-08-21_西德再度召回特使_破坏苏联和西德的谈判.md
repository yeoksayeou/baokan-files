Xinhua News Agency, August 20th, Bonn Dispatch: The West German government has once again recalled its special envoy, Lahr, who was in Moscow participating in trade negotiations between the Soviet Union and West Germany. This is the second time West Germany has recalled its special envoy. However, West German Foreign Minister Brentano said that he hoped Lahr would return to Moscow on August 25th to continue the negotiations.

As before, Lahr's recall this time is still because the West German government insists on resolving the non-existent so-called "repatriation of West German citizens in the Soviet Union" issue as a prerequisite for negotiating trade and other relations between the two countries, thus putting the negotiations in jeopardy.

　  西德再度召回特使
　　破坏苏联和西德的谈判
    据新华社20日讯　波恩消息：西德政府又一次召回在莫斯科参加苏联和西德关于贸易谈判的特使拉尔。这已经是西德第二次召回它的特使。但是，西德外交部长勃伦塔诺说，他希望拉尔能在8月25日回到莫斯科继续进行谈判。
    同上次一样，拉尔这次被召回，仍然是因为西德政府坚持要解决不存在的所谓“遣返在苏联的西德公民的问题”，以此作为谈判两国贸易和其他关系的先决条件，从而使谈判悬于一线。
