Guizhou People's Congress Conducts Debate
Wu Jianping's Theory of "Peaceful Land Reform" Becomes More and More Discredited

    (Our report) The Guizhou Provincial People's Congress has launched a struggle to counterattack the rightists. On the afternoon of August 14th and the morning of August 15th, in group meetings, representatives from Guiyang City, Zunyi area, and other groups severely criticized the lies and fallacies of rightist Wu Jianping.
    Rightist Wu Jianping, a member of the Standing Committee and Secretary-General of the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK) and Deputy Director of the Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, was originally an old warlord, as well as a CC clique member and a secret agent of the Central Statistics Bureau. Before liberation, he organized the "Veterans' Production Cooperative" in northern Guizhou. Relying on this reactionary organization, he was elected as a puppet legislator. At the time of liberation, Wu Jianping also extensively reorganized his troops and led them to loot a large amount of materials in Zunyi, distributing many guns and salt to landlords, local bullies, Shi Ke Dajiye (an honorific), puppet village chiefs, etc., in Suiyang, in an attempt to resist liberation. Later, seeing the rapid advance of the People's Liberation Army, he was compelled by the general trend to turn around and "revolt." After liberation, he applied the same methods to the RCCK organization to cultivate his own power and contend with the Communist Party.
    This rightist, who has consistently been anti-Soviet, anti-communist, and anti-socialist, has issued a series of reactionary remarks since liberation. He advocated "peaceful land reform," and once said, "Why doesn't the United Front Work Department 'unite' the landlords?" At a recent symposium, he even said, "A peaceful transition can be adopted for the national bourgeoisie, why not adopt a peaceful transition for the landlord class?" Wu Jianping also advocated disbanding agricultural cooperatives in mountainous areas and stopping agricultural collectivization in mountainous areas.
    When the Party proposed the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," Wu Jianping slanderously said, "This is to cooperate with the policy of peaceful liberation of Taiwan, and is a political attitude being played towards the Kuomintang in Taiwan and the United States."
    After the Hungarian incident, he uttered the absurd statement, "The Soviet Union has shortcomings in its handling of the Hungarian incident that the United States has seized upon, so in the later stages of the Egyptian incident, the Soviet Union rarely issued statements." The implication was to slander the Soviet Union's interference in Hungary's internal affairs.
    His reactionary words and deeds have been criticized in meetings of relevant units since June.
    At this Provincial People's Congress's Zunyi area delegation meeting, Wu Jianping made an extremely dishonest confession. In addition to admitting that he had extensively looted warehouse military supplies, large sums of money from banks, flour, salt, etc., in Zunyi at the time of liberation, as military supplies for organizing reactionary troops to await an opportunity to resist the Communist Party, his entire "self-criticism" still avoided the important and dwelt on the trivial, repeating only some of his anti-communist and anti-socialist words and deeds that the masses had already exposed.
    Wu Jianping's false self-criticism aroused the boundless anger of the delegates present. The delegates severely refuted his bad attitude and his fallacies of opposing land reform and opposing agricultural collectivization. Chen Tianxiang, a farmer representative from Suiyang County (Wu Jianping's hometown), questioned Wu Jianping on behalf of the more than 8,000 farmers in Guangda Township. He said: The purpose of Wu Jianping's fallacies of "peaceful land reform" and excessive land reform is to vainly attempt to restore the ruling power of the feudal landlords, continue to ride roughshod over the people, and make us farmers live a miserable life again. The farmers of our Guangda Township will never forget the crimes Wu Jianping committed in his hometown. The farmer Peng Taizhong once borrowed 30 yuan from Wu Jianping, and in less than a year, the interest on top of interest turned it into 120 yuan. This is how Wu Jianping cruelly exploited the farmers. Wei Bingfang, a representative from Suiyang County, said: When Wu Jianping went to Suiyang during the land reform, he said to County Magistrate Zhang Ziqing: There are no big landlords in Suiyang, so peaceful land reform can be carried out. Why did Wu Jianping say such a thing? Obviously, he was safeguarding the interests of the landlord class. Wei Bingfang also said: When I came to the province to attend the meeting, the farmers asked me to represent everyone in severely criticizing Wu Jianping's reactionary words and deeds. While I was here attending the meeting, I received a letter from all the members of the Shanfeng Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperative in the remote mountainous area of my county. This letter listed the facts of the cooperative's development and increased production, and expressed great indignation at Wu Jianping's fallacies about disbanding agricultural cooperatives in mountainous areas and stopping agricultural collectivization in mountainous areas.

### 贵州人代会开展辩论　吴剑平的“和平土改”论越驳越臭

　　贵州人代会开展辩论
　　吴剑平的“和平土改”论越驳越臭
    本报讯　贵州省人民代表大会展开了反击右派的斗争。8月14日下午和15日上午，在分组会议上，贵阳市、遵义地区等代表组，严厉批驳右派分子吴剑平的谎言谬论。
    右派分子、民革省委会常委兼秘书长、省民政厅副厅长吴剑平原来是一个旧军阀，又是CC分子、中统特务。解放前，他在黔北曾组织过“在乡军人生产合作社”，依靠这个反动组织，他获选为伪立法委员。临解放时，吴剑平还大肆收编部队，并且带领他的部队，在遵义抢了许多物资，把许多枪枝和盐巴分发给绥阳的地主、恶霸、施哥大爷、伪乡长等，企图抗拒解放。以后，他见解放大军进展迅速，为大势所迫，才不得不回头来“起义”。解放后，他又把这一套手法运用到民革组织中，来培养自己的势力，与共产党抗衡。
    这个一贯反苏、反共、反社会主义的右派分子，解放以来发出了一系列的反动言论。他主张“和平土改”，曾说过：“为什么统战部不‘统’地主？”在最近的一个座谈会上还说：“对民族资产阶级可以采用和平方式过渡，为什么对地主阶级不采用和平方式过渡？”吴剑平还主张解散山区农业合作社，停止山区农业合作化。
    吴剑平在党提出“长期共存，互相监督”的方针时，竟污蔑说：“这是配合和平解放台湾政策，对台湾国民党和美国耍的政治态度”。
    匈牙利事件发生后，他发出了谰言说：“苏联在对匈牙利事件上有短处给美国拿到，所以在埃及事件的后一阶段，苏联就很少发表言论了。”言下之意，就是毁谤苏联干涉匈牙利内政。
    他的反动言行，自6月份以来，已在各有关单位的会议上受到了批判。
    吴剑平在这次省人代会遵义地区代表组，作了极不老实的交代。除了承认他在临解放时，曾在遵义大肆抢劫仓库军用物资、银行大批款子、面粉、食盐等，作为组织反动军队的军用物资，以待时机，对抗共产党以外，在他的整篇“检讨”中，仍是避重就轻，重复群众已揭发的他的部分反共反社会主义言行。
    吴剑平的假检讨激起到会代表们的无比愤怒，代表们对他的恶劣态度，以及反对土改，反对农业合作化的谬论，进行严厉的驳斥。绥阳县农民陈天祥代表广大乡（吴剑平的家乡）八千多农民，向吴剑平提出质问。他说：吴剑平发出“和平土改”，土地改革搞得过火的谬论的目的，是妄想封建地主统治势力复辟，继续站在人民头上作威作福，要我们农民重新过悲惨的生活。我们广大乡的农民永远也不会忘记吴剑平在家乡所造下的罪恶。农民彭太忠曾向吴剑平借了三十块钱，不到一年时间，利上加利就变成了一百二十块钱，吴剑平就是这样残酷地剥削农民的。来自绥阳县的魏炳方代表说：吴剑平在土地改革时，有次去绥阳，对张子清县长说：绥阳没有大地主，可以和平土改。吴剑平为什么要说这样的话呢？显然是在维护地主阶级的利益。魏炳方还说：我来省里开会，农民们纷纷要求我代表大家，严斥吴剑平的反动言行。我来到这里开会期间，又收到来自我县边沿山区山丰高级农业生产合作社全体社员写来的一封信。这封信中列举了这个山区合作社的发展和增产的事实，对吴剑平关于解散山区农业合作社、停止山区农业合作化的谬论，表示了极大的义愤。
