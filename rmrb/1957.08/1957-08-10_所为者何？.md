    What are they doing?
    British colonialists are aggressively carrying out armed suppression of the Omani people's uprising, and the British Foreign Secretary bluntly admitted that this is because "British interests are directly involved." What exactly are these interests? Four big words: oil profits.
    In the past two or three decades, British oil interests in the Middle East have been repeatedly squeezed by the United States, and it has finally been ousted from the absolutely stable top position and has now fallen far behind the United States. However, Britain still holds more than 40% of the oil capital in the Middle East, which is still a considerable amount. These capitals are mainly distributed in the Persian Gulf countries, namely Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, and Qatar. Britain and the Anglo-Dutch oil monopoly organization hold 54% of the capital in the Iranian Oil International Consortium; they hold 52.5% of the capital in both the Iraq Petroleum Company and the Qatar Petroleum Company; and they hold 50% of the capital in Kuwait. According to a report in the London "Economist" magazine, last year, British Petroleum, the largest British oil monopoly group, obtained 49.5 million tons of crude oil from the above four locations, accounting for 99% of the company's total oil production (50 million tons), earning a net profit of approximately £52.5 million. In the same year, the Anglo-Dutch joint oil monopoly group Royal Dutch Shell Oil Company obtained 28 million tons of oil from the Middle East, with an estimated net profit of over £30 million. Therefore, Britain not only obtains a supply of 70 to 80 million tons of oil from the Persian Gulf each year, but also extracts 80 to 90 million pounds in profits from it each year. This huge amount of oil money largely supports the position of the pound. In the words of the West German "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung," the pound would collapse if Britain did not have the foreign exchange income from Persian Gulf oil.
    Currently, although Britain has not yet obtained oil from Muscat and Oman, the Iraq Petroleum Company has obtained a concession to develop oil here and is conducting exploration, which is said to be "very promising." According to a report in the British "Daily Worker," one of the goals of the current Omani people's uprising is to cancel all foreign oil development groups in Oman.
    Once the Omani people's uprising is victorious, Britain will not only lose its "very promising" oil interests in Muscat and Oman, and lose the nearby Buraimi Oasis, but especially this matter may cause a chain reaction in the British colonies along the Persian Gulf, causing a fatal blow to the British oil monopoly groups. This is the reason for Britain's frantic suppression of the Omani people's uprising.

    所为者何？
    英国殖民主义者气势汹汹地对阿曼人民的起义实行武装镇压，英国外交大臣直言不讳地承认这是因为有“英国的利益直接牵涉在内”之故。究竟是什么利益呢？四个大字：石油利润。
    近二、三十年来，英国在中东的石油利益一再受到美国的排挤，终于被从绝对稳坐的第一把交椅上撵下，现在已远落在美国的后面。但是，英国在中东毕竟还占有40％多的石油资本，这仍是一个可观的数目。这些资本主要分布在波斯湾沿岸各国，即伊朗、伊拉克、科威特及卡塔尔。英国和英荷石油垄断组织在伊朗石油国际财团中占有54％的资本；在伊拉克石油公司和卡塔尔石油公司中都占有52.5％的资本；在科威特占有50％的资本。据伦敦“经济学家”杂志报道，去年一年，英国最大石油垄断集团英国石油公司从以上四地取得了四千九百五十万吨原油，为这个公司所获石油总量（五千万吨）的99％，赚得纯利五千二百五十万英镑左右；同年，英、荷联合石油垄断集团皇家荷兰壳牌石油公司从中东获得石油二千八百万吨，估计赚得的纯利在三千万英镑以上。所以，英国每年不仅从波斯湾沿岸取得七千万到八千万吨石油的供应，而且每年从中剥削到八千万到九千万英镑的利润。这笔丰厚的油水相当程度上支撑着英镑的地位。用西德“法兰克福总汇报”的话说，英国如果没有从波斯湾石油所得的外汇收入，英镑就会崩溃。
    目前，英国虽然还没有从马斯喀特和阿曼取得石油，但是伊拉克石油公司已经在这里获得开发石油的特许并正在进行勘探，据说“希望很大”。这次阿曼人民起义的目的之一，据英国“工人日报”报道，就是要取消在阿曼的一切外国石油开发团体。
    一旦阿曼人民的起义取得胜利，英国不光要丢掉它在马斯喀特和阿曼的“希望很大”的石油利益，丢掉附近的布赖米绿州，尤其是这件事可能会在波斯湾沿岸英国殖民地引起连锁反应，使英国石油垄断集团遭到致命的打击。这就是英国疯狂镇压阿曼人民起义的原因。
