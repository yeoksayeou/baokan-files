Xinhua News Agency, August 24th. At the National Conference of Trade Union Activists, the presentations on experiences in grassroots trade union work concluded today. From August 21st to 24th, the chairmen of nine grassroots trade union committees presented their experiences; two enterprise administrative leaders attending the conference as observers also reported on how they relied on workers to run their enterprises well.

The speeches by Chen Heshang, chairman of the Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory Trade Union, and Tong Suqun, the factory director, were particularly valued by the representatives. Due to the conscientious implementation of the mass line by the administrative and trade union leadership of this factory, relying on the masses of workers to improve production, and gradually improving the lives of workers on the basis of production development, the production enthusiasm of the workers has been further enhanced, and the factory's production has greatly improved. It is estimated that the total output value of the factory this year will be nearly twice that of 1950, and labor productivity will also increase by more than one time.

The experience of the China Modern Printing Company Trade Union chairman in convening the workers' representative assembly provided important experience for how trade unions can assist enterprise administration in relying on the masses to run enterprises well. The trade union of this enterprise undertook a series of organizational tasks when it convened the first workers' representative assembly in May this year, which made the assembly very successful. The representatives put forward more than 2,500 suggestions on increasing production and practicing economy and improving work at the assembly. After implementing some of these suggestions, the company's total output value this year increased by 1.16 million yuan, and the total cost decreased by 600,000 yuan. At the same time, it also effectively resolved certain contradictions within the enterprise.

Qi Tinghan, chairman of the trade union of the famous May 3rd Factory, introduced at the meeting the experience of the trade union organizing the masses to supervise enterprise administration. Since 1955, the trade union of this factory has widely carried out mass supervision of enterprise administration through forms such as workers' representative conferences, signing collective contracts and labor protection agreements, and trade union activist conferences. This supervision has played a great role in preventing enterprises from violating the policies and laws of the Party and the state and protecting the legitimate rights and interests of workers. After the establishment of the workers' representative assembly in April this year, the trade union further played its organizational role in organizing the masses to supervise enterprise administration.

Also speaking at the conference in the past few days were Yao Yazhou, chairman of the Trade Union of the Guye Locomotive Depot of the Railway, Wang Dehui, the director of the depot, as well as the chairmen of the trade unions of Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Mill, Tianjin No. 4 Cotton Mill, Shenyang Air Compressor Factory, Jinan Chengji Flour Mill, and China Textile Machinery Factory. They respectively introduced their experiences in how to give play to the organizational role of trade unions, organizing the masses to handle their own affairs, holding workshops and workers' congresses well, and using the strength of activists.

The conference will move into group discussions tomorrow, and then the activist representatives attending the conference will introduce their deeds.

    全国工会积极分子代表会议上
　　工会基层工作经验受到重视
    新华社24日讯　全国工会积极分子代表会议介绍工会基层工作经验的大会发言今天结束。从21日到24日，先后有九个工会基层委员会的主席在会上介绍了经验；两个列席会议的企业行政负责干部也向大会报告了他们依靠工人、办好企业的情况。
    戚墅堰机车车辆修理工厂工会主席陈和尚、厂长童苏群的发言，受到代表们特别重视。这个厂的行政和工会领导方面由于认真贯彻群众路线，依靠职工群众搞好生产，并在生产发展的基础上逐步改善了职工生活，进一步发挥了职工群众的生产积极性，全厂生产有了很大提高。预计今年全厂的总产值将比1950年提高近二倍，劳动生产率也将提高一倍以上。
    中国近代印刷公司工会主席介绍的召开职工代表大会的经验，为工会如何协助企业行政依靠群众办好企业提供了重要经验。这个企业的工会在今年5月召开第一次职工代表大会时担负了一系列的组织工作，使代表大会开得很好。代表们在大会上提出了二千五百多件有关增产节约和改进工作的建议，实现了其中的一些建议后，使全公司今年的总产值增加了一百一十六万元，总成本降低六十万元。同时还很好地调节了企业内部的某些矛盾。
    著名的五三工厂的工会主席齐廷汉在会上介绍了工会组织群众监督企业行政的经验。这个厂的工会组织自1955年起就通过职工代表会议、签订集体合同和劳动保护协议书、工会积极分子会议等形式，对企业行政广泛开展群众性的监督。这种监督对于阻止企业违犯党和国家政策法令、保护职工的正当权益都起了很大作用。今年4月，这个厂建立了职工代表大会以后，工会在组织群众监督企业行政工作方面更进一步发挥了它的组织作用。
    在这几天大会上发言的还有铁路古冶机务段工会主席么亚洲、段长王德惠，以及武汉国棉一厂、天津国棉四厂、沈阳空气压缩机厂、济南成记面粉厂和中国纺织机械厂等单位的工会主席。他们分别介绍了如何发挥工会组织作用、组织群众办群众自己的事、开好车间职工大会和运用积极分子力量等方面的经验。
  大会明天将转入小组讨论，然后由出席会议的积极分子代表介绍事迹。
