    A Brief Discussion of Xiao Qian's "Dog Nature"
	Bu Wen

    Xiao Qian said: A person who stays in a doghouse for a long time, if he doesn't have dog nature, he also loses his human nature.

    I don't know how old Xiao Qian is this year, but in any case, it has not been eight years since the founding of New China, so the "long-staying" doghouse he mentions should be the old society. He said that losing his human nature is indeed a frank statement, but saying he doesn't have dog nature is a self-deprecating remark.

    Xiao Qian's dog nature is, in fact, complete.

    Here, I will only use the point of "worshiping the foreign" to illustrate his "dog nature."

    The so-called worshiping the foreign is worshiping everything foreign; general worshipers of the foreign merely like to speak foreign languages, wear foreign clothes, eat foreign food, and never forget the life of the foreign concessions after tea and wine... and so on, but Xiao Qian is different. He is so overwhelmed to the point of exclaiming, "It's amazing!" Like Zhang Sheng seeing Yingying, he says, "Is that a human? He is a god!"

    Don't misunderstand, thinking this is his romance. Although his romances are indeed numerous, and he even cohabited with an English woman, the "god" he is talking about here is an American man!

    It is said that he personally experienced such a thing:

    Once, while riding in a jeep, it broke down on the road. He asked Chinese people for help, but they didn't respond; as a result, a vehicle from the American consulate stopped automatically without even being asked and fixed it for him. So he exclaimed, "Is that a human? He is a god!" (Quoted from "New Observer" issue 16)

    This story took place during the period when the United States had consulates in China, that is, during the period when the Chinese people were under reactionary rule. At that time, the Chinese people were in the double shackles of reactionary rule and imperialist oppression. The great Communists lit torches in the darkness, calling on the slaves to rise up and fight, and surrounding them were instruments of torture, nooses, and butcher knives, still warm with the blood of comrades!

    When Xiao Qian was riding in a jeep gallivanting in the foreign concessions, the Chinese people were being slaves. Xiao Qian was high above the Chinese people and low beneath imperialism. He wanted the yellow-skinned Chinese to help him fix his car. Such condescension was simply too flattering for them, and they dared to "not respond," which was extremely "ignorant"; and the Americans, whom he could not reach, automatically came to help him. This made him flattered and moved to tears, and after exclaiming "god," it was a natural expression of his true feelings!

    In Xiao Qian's mind, Americans are gods, and England is "paradise"; although Japan is small, Xiao Qian also believes it achieved results when it ruled Taiwan. Therefore, Xiao Qian's ideal is very specific: as long as the Chinese are taught and trained by Americans, using the British political system, plus the Japanese style of rule, then, although he regrets that he did not ask the Eight-Power Allied Forces to stay and jointly govern China when they invaded Beijing; now, if he can find three countries to realize his ideal, he can comfort himself somewhat! (Materials from the August 17th People's Daily)

    This is truly the direct descendant of "giving to foreign countries rather than to domestic slaves."

    Why can't his ideal be realized? Because there is the Chinese Communist Party, because the Chinese Communist Party has liberated the people and wants to build a socialist society.

    We want a socialist system, and Xiao Qian wants a capitalist system. -- Writing this, I suddenly remember Mr. Lu Xun's essay: "The homeless, capitalist running dog."

    That was when reactionary professor Liang Shiqiu felt wronged when he was called a "capitalist running dog," because he: "I don't even know who my master is, and I haven't received a penny in reward!" (Roughly the meaning) So Mr. Lu Xun said:

	This is a vivid portrayal of a "capitalist running dog." All running dogs, although perhaps kept by one capitalist, actually belong to all capitalists, so they are docile to all the rich and bark madly at all the poor. Not knowing who its master is is precisely the reason why it is docile to all the rich, which is also evidence that it belongs to all capitalists. Even if no one keeps it, and it becomes skinny from hunger and turns into a stray dog, it is still docile to all the rich and barks madly at all the poor, but at this time it is even more unclear who its master is. …Since he recounts how hard he works,…and doesn’t know “who the master is,”…for accuracy, we must add a word and call it: “homeless” “capitalist running dog.”

    Isn't this all a portrayal of Xiao Qian? Although he eats the people's grain and is quite prosperous, he is indeed a homeless stray dog! Although his master is far overseas, because his dog nature still exists, he barks madly at any opportunity.

    Dog nature is difficult to change, and we must not measure it with human feelings. We must pursue the right-wing elements like Xiao Qian, who are barking madly against the Party and the people, to the end. Even if they flee in panic, even if they become drowned dogs, in order to defend the socialist cause, we must not "tolerate" and "trust" them!

### 略论萧乾的“狗性”

    略论萧乾的“狗性”
　　布文
    萧乾说：一个人在狗窝里呆久了，没有狗性，也失掉了人性。
    我不知道萧乾今年高龄几何，总之，新中国成立至今，还未满八年，可见他“呆得久的”狗窝，应该是旧社会才对。他说，失掉了人性确是坦率之辞，至于说没有狗性，则是自谦之辞了。
    萧乾的狗性，其实是十足的。
    这里，仅以“崇外”这一点，来说明他的“狗性”。
    所谓崇外，就是崇拜外国的一切；一般的崇外者，不过喜欢说洋话，穿洋衣，吃洋饭，茶前酒后，念念不忘洋场生活……等等而已，但是，萧乾却与众不同，他竟倾倒如此地步，“惊为天人！”像张生见莺莺似的，他说：“他那是人？他是神仙啊！”
    您别误会，以为这是他的艳遇。虽然他的艳事确实不少，也曾与一个英国女人同居过，但是这里他所说的那“神仙”，却是一个美国男人！
    据说他亲身经历过这么一件事：
    有一次坐了吉普车，在路上抛锚了，他求助于中国人，不应；结果是一个美国领事馆的车子，并没打招呼就自动停下来，替他弄好，于是他赞叹道：“他那是人，他是神仙啊！”（引“新观察”十六期材料）
    这个故事，是发生在美国有领事馆在中国的时期，即是中国人民受反动统治的时期。那时候，中国人民在反动统治与帝国主义压迫的双重镣铐之中，伟大的共产党人，在黑暗中燃起火把，号召奴隶们起来斗争，而包围他们的是滴着同志们鲜血犹温的刑具、绞索和屠刀！
    当萧乾坐着吉普车驰骋洋场的时候，中国人民正在当奴隶。萧乾是高高在中国人民之上，低低在帝国主义之下，他要黄脸皮的中国人帮他弄车子，如此下顾，简直是太抬举他们了，而他们竟敢“不应”，真是“愚昧无知”之极了；而他所高不可攀的美国人，竟自动来帮助他，这使他受宠若惊，感激涕零之后，叹为：“神仙”，是真情流露所必然的了！
    在萧乾的心目中，美国人是神仙，英国又是“天堂”；日本虽小，但在它统治台湾的时候，萧乾也认为有成绩，所以萧乾的理想倒很具体，只要中国人由美国人来教导训练，用英国的政治制度，加上日本式的统治方法，那么，虽然他很后悔，在八国联军攻进北京的时候，没有请八国留下共管中国；现在如能找到三国来实现理想，也差可自慰了！（材料见8月17日人民日报）
    这真是“宁赠外邦，不予家奴”的嫡传衣钵。
    他的理想为什么不能实现？因为有中国共产党，因为中国共产党解放了人民，要建设社会主义社会。
    我们要社会主义制度，萧乾要资本主义制度。——写到这里，忽然记起鲁迅先生的杂文：“丧家的、资本家的乏走狗”来。
    那是当反动教授梁实秋，在被称为“资本家的走狗”的时候，自己觉得冤枉，因为他：“我还不知道我的主子是谁，而且也并未拿到一文赏钱！”（大意如此）于是鲁迅先生说：
        这正是“资本家的走狗”的活写真。凡走狗，虽或为一个资本家所豢养，其实是属于所有的资本家的，所以它遇见所有的阔人都驯良，遇见所有的穷人都狂吠。不知道谁是它的主子，正是它遇见所有的阔人都驯良的原因，也就是属于所有资本家的证据。即使无人豢养，饿的精瘦，变成野狗了，但还是遇见所有的阔人都驯良，遇见所有的穷人都狂吠的，不过这时它就愈不明白谁是主子了。……既然自叙他怎样辛苦，……又不知道“主子是谁”，……为恰当计，还得添个字，称为：“丧家的”“资本家的走狗”。
    这不全是萧乾的写照吗？虽然吃着人民的粮，倒颇发福，但确是丧家的一条野狗了！虽然他的主子远在海外，但因为狗性尚存，一有机会就狺狺狂吠起来。
    狗性难改，切不要将人情来度量，我们要将狂吠着反党反人民的右派分子萧乾之流追击到底，即使他们落荒而走，即使它们成为落水狗，为了保卫社会主义事业，我们决不能对他们“容忍”与“放心”！
