    Instrument for Measuring Cosmic Rays—Graphite Counter Tube
    The state-owned Nanjing Bulb Factory is producing graphite counter tubes for Chinese scientists to use in measuring cosmic rays during the International Geophysical Year.
    From 1955 to now, the Nanjing Bulb Factory has successively trial-produced and produced eight kinds of counter tubes with different types of radiation and different dose levels. There are also two new types of counter tubes currently under trial production.
    Counter tubes are an effective tool for measuring ionizing particles, and can be used to measure various ionizing particles emitted by various radioactive substances during decay. With the rapid development of the peaceful use of atomic energy and isotopes, counter tubes will be widely used in atomic energy power, isotope industry, physics, chemistry, agriculture, medicine, physiology, and other sciences. ·Xinhua News Agency·

    测量宇宙射线的工具——石墨计数管
    国营南京灯泡厂正在生产石墨计数管，供我国科学家参加国际地球物理年测量宇宙射线用。
    从1955年到现在，南京灯泡厂先后试制和生产了八种不同种类射线及不同大小剂量的计数管。目前还有两种新的计数管正在试制。
    计数管是一种测量电离质点的有效工具，利用它可以测量各种放射性物质在衰变过程中放出的各种电离质点。随着和平利用原子能和同位素事业的迅速发展，计数管将广泛地应用于原子能动力方面、同位素工业和物理、化学、农业、医学、生理学等科学。  ·新华社·
