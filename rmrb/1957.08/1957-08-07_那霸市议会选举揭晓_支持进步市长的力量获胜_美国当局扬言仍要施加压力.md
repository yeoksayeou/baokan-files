Xinhua News Agency, August 6th: Naha Mayor and Secretary-General of the People's Party, Kamekichi Senaga, achieved victory in the Naha City Council election held on Okinawa Island's capital on August 4th, causing the U.S. military authorities, who were determined to remove Senaga from office, to suffer another defeat.

According to statistics released on August 5th, the forces supporting Senaga increased to twelve seats in the Naha City Council's total of thirty seats, exceeding one-third of the total seats; the forces opposing Senaga decreased to seventeen seats, with one independent.

Since Senaga, who opposes the U.S. military's militarization of Okinawa Island, was elected Mayor of Naha last December, the U.S. military authorities have repeatedly exerted pressure to force him to step down. In June of this year, the U.S. military authorities instigated local forces to pass a vote of no confidence against Senaga in the City Council. At that time, twenty-four votes supported the motion, while only six opposed it. Senaga then dissolved the City Council and decided to hold this election. The outcome of this election not only shows a significant increase in the forces supporting Senaga but also gives Senaga enough votes to eliminate the possibility of the City Council passing another vote of no confidence against him with a two-thirds majority. According to regulations, if the City Council expresses no confidence in the mayor twice, the mayor must resign.

During this campaign, Senaga raised slogans such as: oppose the U.S. military's requisition of land to expand military bases; return Okinawa Island to Japan, and stop the U.S. military control over Okinawa's finances and trade.

The U.S. Civil Administrator of the Ryukyu Islands, Moore, stated on August 6th that the U.S. military authorities would not adopt a more lenient attitude toward Kamekichi Senaga, the mayor of Naha, the capital of Okinawa Island, because of his victory in the recent City Council election.

Moore also stated that the U.S. military authorities would continue to freeze Naha's deposits in the Ryukyu Central Bank. (Attached picture)

### 那霸市议会选举揭晓  支持进步市长的力量获胜  美国当局扬言仍要施加压力

    那霸市议会选举揭晓
    支持进步市长的力量获胜
    美国当局扬言仍要施加压力
    据新华社6日讯  那霸市长、人民党书记长濑长龟次郎已经在8月4日举行的冲绳岛首府那霸市议会选举中取得胜利，使一心想把濑长赶下台去的美军当局再次遭到失败。
    据8月5日发表的统计数字，在那霸市议会的全部三十个议席中，支持濑长的势力增加到十二席，超过了全部议席的三分之一；反对濑长的势力减少到十七席，独立人士一席。
    自从反对美国使冲绳岛军事基地化的濑长在去年12月当选那霸市长以来，美军当局就一再运用压力想逼他下台。今年6月，美军当局唆使地方势力在市议会通过对濑长的不信任案。当时，支持这个议案的达二十四票，反对的只有六票。濑长随即解散了市议会，并且决定举行这次选举。这次选举的结果，不仅表明支持濑长的力量显著增长，并且使濑长获得足够的票数消除市议会用三分之二的多数票再次通过对他的不信任案的可能性。按照规定，如果市议会两次表示不信任市长，市长就必须辞职。
    濑长在这次竞选中曾经提出这样的口号：反对美军征用土地来扩大军事基地；把冲绳岛归还日本，停止美国对冲绳财政和贸易的军事控制。
    琉球群岛的美国民政长官穆尔6日表示，美国军事当局将不会因为冲绳岛首府那霸市市长濑长龟次郎在最近市议会选举中取得胜利而对他采取比较缓和的态度。
    穆尔还表示，美军当局仍然要继续冻结在琉球中央银行中的那霸市存款。（附图片）
