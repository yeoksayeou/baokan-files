　　Wolf
　　——A Short Note from the Pasture
　　Liu Lanshan
　　During these days on the Chabei Pasture, 1,500 meters above sea level, I spend all day watching the herds of horses, cattle, and sheep graze on the grass like black and white clouds in the sky, listening to the moving calls of turtledoves and the gentle songs of the herdsmen – songs that sometimes mention wolves. So, I asked a herdsman to tell me about wolves.
　　Before liberation, this place was still a barren grassland on the plateau. Packs of wolves would come out in broad daylight, their howls echoing for dozens of miles with the whistling wind, shaking the earthen houses. Cunning wolves would sometimes hide in the deep grass by the roadside, watching people and livestock passing by. Sometimes they would break into villages, snatching away or injuring children and domestic animals. Sometimes they would chase the fleet-footed gazelles wildly on the plains, making the people of the grassland "turn pale at the mention of wolves" for a long time. Now, agricultural and pastoral cooperatives are scattered across the plateau like stars in the summer night sky, illuminating the roads of the grassland and igniting the people's enthusiasm for building a socialist grassland. Our huge, vast, and modern state-owned pasture is like the Big Dipper in the sky, radiating intense light. The herdsman said, "Therefore, you can imagine, how can we forget the wolves?!"
　　We passed through a valley to a grassland pond built with a dam to water the sheep. The herdsman pointed to the holes covered by green grass on the valley slope, but still visible, and said, "These are wolf dens, and this valley is where the wolves drink water." While driving the sheep, he continued to tell me: After liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the government, farmers and herdsmen organized wolf-fighting teams, with the army cooperating, to launch an encirclement and annihilation campaign against the wolves. The Mongolian people, skilled in horsemanship, further developed their traditional skills. The wolf-fighting teams in all the grassland villages, far apart from each other, always kept horses ready. Once a wolf was discovered, the team members would chase after it on horseback. When the team members of another village saw it, they would continue the chase, just like the ancient postal relays, and like a modern relay race, until the wolf was exhausted and could no longer run. Then, they would cast a lasso, tie up the wolf alive, and drag it back all the way.
　　The poplar trees planted on the plateau are growing towards the sun, and the pregnant bellies of the female animals are also swelling with the lush grass. The green wheat fields and grasslands dye the low sky blue, and the days of a great harvest on the grassland are already in sight. However, the herdsman told me meaningfully, "Wolves naturally know all this, but they will not admit defeat themselves. Therefore, in the remote and uninhabited wilderness valleys, there are still a few wolves left that have not been wiped out. They hide darkly in deep caves and do not come out even in the evening. Only in the deep black night when people are sound asleep, the lonely wolves silently crawl on the grassland, smelling the scent of cattle and sheep manure, and sometimes let out a sharp, man-eating howl!..."
　　This herdsman is a veteran who participated in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. He fought American "wolves" in Korea and was wounded. Now, the injury still aches on cloudy and rainy days. "However, we are now more experienced in fighting wolves," he added, and then sang a loud song and chased after the sheep.
　　Standing on the vast grassland like the sea, I looked at the distant sky for a long time, thinking about the howls of these remaining wolves, and I couldn't help but think of the voices of Ge Peiqi, Chu Anping, and Zhang Naiqi, who wear people's clothes...

### 狼——牧场短札

　　狼
　　——牧场短札
　　刘岚山
    在海拔一千五百公尺高的察北牧场上的这些日子里，成天看着马、牛、羊群就像天空的黑白云彩一样在草地上吃草，听着动人的白鸽鸟叫和牧人的娓娓歌声——歌曲中有时提到狼。于是，我要求一个牧人给我讲讲狼。
    解放以前，这里还是一个高原上的荒草滩子，野狼成群地在大白天出来，嗥叫声随着大风呼啸过数十里外，土屋都为之震颤；狡猾成性的野狼，有时隐藏在路边深草里，窥伺着过路的人和牲畜；有时撞进村舍，抢走或咬坏小孩和家畜；有时在野地上狂追着善走的黄羊；使得草原人民在漫长的岁月中都“谈狼色变”。如今，农牧业合作社像夏夜天空的星群遍布在高原上，照亮着草原的大路，燃烧着人们建设社会主义草原的热情；而我们这个巨大的、广阔的现代化的国营牧场就仿佛是天空的北斗，放射着强烈的光辉。牧人说：“因此，你想，我们怎能忘记狼呢？！”
    我们经过一条沟谷到筑起拦水坝的草原水塘去饮羊，牧人指着谷坡上青草掩盖着的、但仍然看得出的洞穴说：“这就是狼洞，而这个谷沟就是狼喝水的地方。”他一边赶着羊一边继续告诉我：解放后，在党和政府的领导下，农牧民组织起打狼队，部队做配合，向野狼发动了围歼；善于骑术的蒙古族人民更发挥了传统的特长，相隔很远的所有草园村落的打狼队都常备着马匹，当野狼一经发现时，队员们便拍马猛追，另一村队员看见了，便接着追过去，仿佛古代的驿运那样，也仿佛现代的接力赛跑那样，一直把野狼追得精疲力竭，再也跑不动了，他们就撒出套马索，活活地缚住狼，把它一路拖回来。
    高原上栽植的杨树正在迎着阳光生长，母畜们怀孕的肚子也随着青草的肥壮而膨胀起来，碧绿碧绿的麦田和草原，把低低的天空染得透蓝，草原大丰收的日子已经望得见了。但是，牧人却意味深长地告诉我说：“狼自然知道这一切，但它不会自己承认失败，因此，现在人迹罕到的荒山野谷底，还残存着未打尽的少数野狼，它们阴暗地躲在深洞里，傍晚也不出来；直到人们熟睡的深黑夜，孤独的野狼才不声不响地在草原上爬行，嗅着牛羊粪味，有时候还会发出尖厉的要吃人的嗥声！……”
    这位牧人是复员军人，参加过抗美援朝战争，在朝鲜打过美国狼，身上受过伤，如今阴天下雨还隐隐作痛。“不过，我们现在打狼更有经验了。”他补充说了一句，就唱起嘹亮的歌声追赶羊群去了。
    我站在海一样广阔的草原上，久久地望着远天，想着这些残存的狼的嗥叫，不禁想到穿着人的衣服的葛佩琦、储安平、章乃器们的声音……
