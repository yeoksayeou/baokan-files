　　National Trade Union Activist Representatives Gather in Beijing
　　Exchange Grassroots Trade Union Work Experience
    This newspaper reports that the National Trade Union Activist Representatives Conference opened in Beijing yesterday. This is the first mass conference in our country's trade unions to exchange and summarize work experience. The conference will summarize and exchange the work experience accumulated by the trade union grass-roots committees and the broad masses of trade union activists over the past few years, study and solve some basic problems in the current trade union grass-roots work, so as to push forward the trade union work in our country. The representatives will listen to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions' report on trade union work in the workers' congress.
    There are 1,062 representatives attending the conference. 263 full-time cadres of trade union organizations at all levels in various regions and heads of enterprise party organizations and administrations were also invited to participate in the conference. These many trade union activist representatives from industrial and mining enterprises, transportation, commerce, education, finance, cooperatives and other systems in 27 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities across the country represent the three million trade union activists across the country who are enthusiastically serving the masses. Among them are the chairman and vice-chairman of grass-roots trade unions; production committee members who are good at organizing workers to carry out socialist emulation; labor protection committee members, labor insurance committee members, living and housing committee members, and female workers' family members who care about workers' production and life and actively reflect the opinions and requirements of the masses; There are also propaganda committee members, club directors, mutual savings fund directors, organization committee members, trade union group leaders and group officers, etc., who are deeply loved by the workers. Many of them complete their work tasks at their production posts and then use their spare time to engage in trade union work, enthusiastically serving their class brothers. Among them, there are 629 advanced workers and model workers, accounting for 57% of all representatives.
    Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, delivered an opening speech at the meeting yesterday. He said that since 1953, trade union work at the grass-roots level across the country has accumulated many new experiences. In particular, since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed last year that enterprises should establish a system of factory director responsibility under the leadership of the Party committee and a system of workers' congresses, trade union work at the grass-roots level has made greater progress. He said that studying, summarizing and popularizing the grass-roots work experience during this period is an important task of the current trade union leading organs. He also said that to summarize the experience of grass-roots work, it is necessary to summarize the experience of trade union activists. Because trade union groups and various working committees are the organizations for trade unions to carry out various specific activities, and the activists in trade union groups and various working committees are the backbone of the trade unions living among the masses, and experience in all aspects can be reflected in the activists. The purpose of this meeting is to disseminate and promote these experiences. The dissemination and promotion of these experiences can make trade union work more active, the relationship between trade unions and the masses closer, and enable it to play a greater role in the cause of socialist construction.
    Lai Ruoyu said: At present, factories and mining enterprises in various regions are carrying out a campaign to increase production and practice economy and an advanced producer movement, and will also launch a rectification movement to crush the attacks of bourgeois rightists and improve the work of enterprises, strengthen the unity of the working class, and enable us to win victories on both the production and rectification fronts.
    Li Xuefeng, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Minister of the Industrial Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, made a report at the afternoon meeting on launching the rectification movement and carrying out socialist education in industrial, mining and transportation enterprises.
    At the morning meeting, Qi Tinghan, chairman of the trade union of the 53rd Factory, introduced the experience of the trade union organization of this factory in leading workers to implement mass supervision of enterprise administration and educating new workers after the second half of 1955.

　　全国工会积极分子代表在京集会
　　交流基层工会工作经验
    本报讯　全国工会积极分子代表会议昨天在北京开幕。这是我国工会第一次群众性的交流和总结工作经验的会议。会上将总结和交流工会基层委员会和广大工会积极分子几年来积累起来的工作经验，研究和解决当前工会基层工作的一些基本问题，以便把我国的工会工作向前推进一步。代表们将要听取全国总工会关于建立职工代表大会中的工会工作的报告。
    出席这次会议的代表有一千零六十二人。各地区各级工会组织的专职干部和企业党组织、行政的负责人二百六十三人也应邀参加了会议。这许多来自全国二十七个省、自治区和市的工矿企业、交通运输业、商业、教育、金融、合作社等系统的工会积极分子代表，代表着全国各地热心为群众服务的三百万工会积极分子。他们当中有基层工会正副主席；善于组织职工开展社会主义竞赛的生产委员；关心工人生产、生活，积极反映群众意见和要求的劳动保护委员、劳动保险委员、生活居住委员、女工家属委员；也有深受职工爱戴的宣传委员、俱乐部主任、互助储金会主任、组织委员、工会小组长以及小组干事等等。他们许多人都是在生产岗位上完成工作任务后，利用业余的时间从事工会工作，热忱地为阶级弟兄服务。在他们之中，先进工作者和劳动模范就有六百二十九名，占全体代表的57％。
    中华全国总工会主席赖若愚昨天在会上致开幕词。他说：1953年以来，全国工会基层工作积累了许多新的经验。特别是去年中共中央提出在企业中要建立党委领导下的厂长负责制和职工代表大会制以来，工会基层工作有了更大的发展。他说，研究、总结和推广这一时期的基层工作经验，是当前工会领导机关的一项重要任务。他又说，要总结基层工作经验，就必须总结工会积极分子活动的经验。因为工会的小组和各种工作委员会是工会进行各种具体活动的组织，工会小组和各种工作委员会里的积极分子又是生活在群众当中的工会的骨干，各方面的经验都可以从积极分子身上体现出来。这次会议的目的，就是传播与推广这些经验。这些经验的传播和推广，可以使工会工作更加活跃，工会与群众的关系更加紧密，使它在社会主义建设事业中发挥更大的作用。
    赖若愚说：目前各地的厂矿企业，正在开展增产节约和先进生产者运动，并且也将展开整风运动，来粉碎资产阶级右派分子的进攻和改进企业的工作，加强工人阶级的团结，使我们在生产和整风的两条战线上都取得胜利。
    中共中央书记处书记、中共中央工业部部长李雪峰在下午的会议上作了关于在工矿交通企业中开展整风运动和进行社会主义教育的报告。
    在上午会议上，五三工厂工会主席齐廷汉介绍了这个工厂的工会组织在1955年下半年以后领导职工对企业行政实行群众监督的经验和对新工人进行教育工作的经验。
