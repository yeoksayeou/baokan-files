Xi'an Coalfield Geological Exploration Bureau Workers Track Down and Expose a Hidden Rightist Clique

　　This newspaper, Xi'an, 21st. Workers at the Northwest Coalfield Geological Exploration Bureau have uncovered a very well-hidden rightist clique that was attempting to slip through the net. In mid-July, when the bureau was conducting a reasoning struggle against the rightist element Jiang Chengming, he attempted to deflect the focus by saying, "Why don't you catch the 'big shrimp' and only catch this 'little shrimp' like me?" After persistent questioning and prompting by the masses, he finally exposed the reactionary statements and behind-the-scenes activities of Chen Zhongchong, a technician in the Geology Department, this "big shrimp." After further exposure by the broad masses of workers, the true form of the rightist clique headed by Chen Zhongchong was revealed.

　　In addition to Chen Zhongchong, the members of this rightist clique included Xu Juru, a technician from the Bureau's 146 Exploration Team, and Li Geping (under surveillance in the office), a key member of a counter-revolutionary clique punished during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries at the Xi'an Coal Mining Administration. This rightist clique recruited some backward elements from around them, everywhere slandering and attacking Party members and Party organizations, even the international communist movement. They spread rumors that "agricultural cooperativization has been messed up and the living standards of farmers have declined," that "water conservancy projects have been messed up, no flowers are blooming on both sides of the Huai River, and there are even more disaster victims," saying that "the construction of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway also has the Kuomintang to thank," slandering the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement as "wronging good people and violating the constitution," and believing that "the Hungarian incident shows that socialism won't last long, and hopefully China will soon have a 'Hungarian incident' too." They also used codes and nicknames to communicate. After the start of the rectification campaign, they frequently corresponded, exchanging information about the rightist attacks on the Party and encouraging and supporting each other.

　  西安煤田地质勘探局职工跟踪追击
　　查出一个隐蔽的右派小集团
    本报西安21日电　西北煤田地质勘探局职工搜查出一个非常隐蔽的企图蒙混过关的右派小集团。7月中旬，这个局向局内右派分子蒋承铭进行说理斗争时，他为了转移目标曾经透露说：“你们为什么不抓‘大虾米’，只抓我这‘小虾米？’”在群众追问、启发之后，他终于揭发了地质处技术员陈钟崇这个“大虾米”的反动言论和幕后活动，经过广大职工的进一步揭发，以陈钟崇为首的右派小集团原形暴露了。
    这个右派小集团的成员除陈钟崇以外，还有该局146勘探队技术员徐九如和西安煤矿管理局一个肃反中被惩处过的反革命小集团首要分子李戈萍（留机关管制）。这个右派小集团网罗周围一些落后分子，到处污蔑攻击党员和党组织，以至国际共产主义运动。他们造谣说“农业合作化搞糟了，农民生活水平降低了”，“水利事业搞糟了，淮河两岸没有开鲜花，灾民更多”，说什么“修宝成铁路也有国民党的功劳”，诬蔑肃反运动是“冤枉好人，违反宪法”，并且认为“匈牙利事件发生说明社会主义长不了，希望中国很快也来个‘匈牙利事件’”。他们还用密码和代号进行联络。在整风开始以后，他们经常通信，交换右派分子向党进攻的情况，并且互相鼓励支持。
