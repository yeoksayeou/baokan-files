Cotton-Producing Areas Rapidly Expand Cotton Ginning Work
Zhengzhou and Shanghai Rush to Manufacture Machinery to Support

(Reported by this newspaper) To fully utilize short-staple cotton resources, cotton seed ginning work has been rapidly launched in cotton-producing areas across the country.

During this period, various provinces have actively adopted measures for short-staple cotton production. Many provinces, with cotton ginning factories as the main focus, and taking into account the conditions of cotton seed oil pressing factories, have specifically determined the addition of ginning equipment to each factory. Many provinces have increased the proportion of seed cotton purchased and have rationally organized the ginning work of seed cotton (including seed cotton) held by agricultural cooperatives. For example, Hebei Province organized the ginning power of agricultural cooperatives around cotton purchasing stations, and then the supply and marketing cooperatives equipped them with corresponding ginning equipment to carry out short-staple cotton production.

In order to solve the problems in adding ginning equipment in a timely manner, the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives has made specific arrangements. The current central task is to strengthen the assembly and test run of the more than 300 ginning machines that are about to be installed and completed, and strive to put them into production after the new cotton is on the market; the remaining 600 or so newly added ginning machines should be installed by December.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, August 28th: The state-owned Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory plans to manufacture 100 cotton seed delinting machines before the end of October this year, and will manufacture a large number of these machines next year. Each delinting machine can process 500 jin of cotton seeds per hour, yielding 25 jin of short-staple cotton.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 29th: Shanghai factories are rushing to manufacture boilers and other mechanical equipment and accessories for ginning machines. The state-owned Shanghai Boiler Factory recently began manufacturing two types of boilers with power generation capacities of 120 kilowatts and 240 kilowatts. Each boiler can drive many ginning machines. The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Mechanical and Electrical Industry has also organized a group of factories to rush to produce 30,000 ground shafts for cotton gins. (Attached picture)

　　产棉区剥绒工作迅速展开
    郑州、上海赶制机械支援
    本报讯　为了充分利用短绒资源，棉籽剥绒工作已经普遍在全国各棉区迅速展开。
    这一时期中，各省对短绒生产积极采取了措施。许多省以轧花厂为主，并照顾到棉籽榨油厂的条件，具体确定了增添各厂的剥绒设备。不少省份扩大了籽棉收购比重，并对农业社掌握的籽棉（包括留种棉）的剥绒工作进行了合理的组织。如河北省把农业社的轧花力量组织到棉花采购站的周围，再由供销社配备相应的剥绒设备，开展短绒生产。
    为了及时解决添置剥绒设备中的问题，中华全国供销合作总社已分别作了具体安排。当前的中心任务是加强将要安装竣工的三百多台剥绒机的装配和试车工作，争取在新花上市后投入生产；其余六百多部新增剥绒机，争取在12月份内安装完毕。
    据新华社郑州28日电　国营郑州纺织机械厂计划在今年10月底以前制造出棉籽脱绒机一百台，明年还要大量制造这种机器。这种脱绒机每台每小时能加工棉籽五百斤，得棉花短绒二十五斤。
    据新华社上海29日电　上海的工厂正在赶制剥绒机的锅炉等机械设备和配件。国营上海锅炉厂最近开始制造发电能力一百二十瓩和二百四十瓩的两种锅炉。每一台锅炉可以带动好多台剥绒机。上海市机电工业局也组织了一批工厂，在突击生产三万根轧花机的地轴。（附图片）
