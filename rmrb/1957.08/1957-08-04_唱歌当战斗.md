Singing as a Battle
    Sun Yulei

    In August 1938, our Third Detachment of the Self-Defense Army was ordered to rush to Niuzhen on the Luan River in eastern Hebei. Along the way, we had to pass through the enemy's blockade line—the Pingjin Railway and the Yongding River. These were nothing, the most difficult thing was to pass through the Lianzhuang area of ​​dozens of villages in Wuqing County.

    Lianzhuang was originally a people's self-defense armed force. When Japan attacked, it fought against Japan. However, because landlords occupied the leading position, it was soon used by the Japanese. Last time we passed through Lianzhuang, they blocked us everywhere. Of course, they would make things difficult for us this time, and we had an urgent task and did not have time to deal with them.

    Early in the morning, the instructor mobilized us for a "peaceful battle" to pass through Lianzhuang. Afterwards, we set off. Along the way, everyone was talking about it, and some people had no confidence in today's "battle." We were the vanguard company, and we were even more nervous. Some comrades insisted that the superiors were "confused," saying, "What's the use of singing!"...

    At that time, I was a bugler, following the company commander and instructor in front. I even heard the company commander say, "It is not easy to command such a battle, it's difficult!" As for me, because the instructor announced that I would be in charge of directing the singing, I had even more on my mind.

    At noon, we came to an orchard. On the other side of the forest, we could see the villages in the Lianzhuang area. At this time, the detachment organized a strong firepower team to follow behind our company. After tidying up, we strode into the orchard. The golden pears and strings of fiery red hawthorns made people drool. Someone picked up a hawthorn from the ground, but before they could put it in their mouth, they were stopped and reprimanded: "It doesn't matter if you eat one hawthorn! But it can make our battle fail!"

    As soon as we walked out of the orchard, we heard "bang! bang!" gunshots. We slowed down our pace and quickly formed a marching column of six rows. The six machine guns were lined up in front. The company commander gave the order to "march in step," and the troops immediately became majestic. The sound of "scratch! scratch!" footsteps, mixed with the sound of gunfire, opened the prelude to the "battle."

    When the troops approached the village, the company commander turned his head and nodded to me and said, "From now on, you are the commander. Command the 'battle'!" I quickly stepped out of the line and, imitating the platoon leader, shouted a few times "one, two, one." When people's footsteps were already in rhythm, I issued the "battle" order: "Muzzles outward, march forward in step..." Then, a song that resounded through the clouds, like a wave, started from the vanguard company, swept across the ranks of the entire detachment, forming a earth-shattering force.

    The Lianzhuang armed forces were still shooting at us, and bullets passed by us from time to time, but no one paid attention to it. The armed forces of the Lianzhuang were all rushing over, and the firepower suddenly became dense. Our safety was threatened, but our singing did not stop, but only added an accompaniment—the firepower team suppressed the other side from the side. We moved forward without fear. Our song of "Don't hurt the common people, don't fight our own people" spread there, and the enemy there disarmed spiritually and shouted, "Don't shoot! This is our own team!" Some armed forces withdrew in formation.

    The comrades' doubts disappeared. I was even more energetic, waving my arms, commanding the team, and singing "We are an iron army, we are an iron heart, safeguarding the Chinese nation, and forever being free people," marching straight towards the village entrance. The gunfire subsided, and white flags were planted on the village walls. The singing awakened the villages under Japanese rule. Look, men, women, old and young, swarmed around the village, eagerly watching us.

    In this way, our singing resounded from this village to that village. By evening, we had passed through dozens of villages in the Lianzhuang area and successfully reached our destination.

    The seeds sown have blossomed. A month later, when we returned to the Lianzhuang area, the song "Muzzles outward, march forward in step" resounded everywhere, and thousands of people in every village welcomed us. Soon, people's anti-Japanese forces were organized here.

    唱歌当战斗
    孙玉雷
    1938年8月，我们自卫军三支队奉命赶到冀东滦河边上的牛镇。沿途要通过敌人封锁线——平津铁路和永定河，这些都不算什么，最困难的是，要通过武清县几十个村的联庄区。
    联庄本来是人民组织的自卫武装，日本进攻时，曾经打过日本，但是，由于地主分子占领导势力，不久就为日本人所利用了。我们前次路过联庄，他们到处拦阻我们，这次当然还要与我们为难，而我们是任务紧急，没有时间和他们周旋。
    一清早，指导员对我们作了“和平战斗”通过联庄的动员。以后，我们就出发了。一路上，大家议论纷纷，有的人对今天的“战斗”没有信心。我们是前卫连，心情更紧张些，有的同志硬认为上级“糊涂”，说唱歌顶什么用！……
    那时，我当司号员，跟着连长、指导员走在前面，还听到连长说：“指挥这样的战斗不容易，难哪！”至于我，因为指导员宣布，由我指挥唱歌，就更多了一重心事。
    中午，我们来到一片果林，林的那边，就可以看到联庄区的村子了。这时，支队组织了一个强有力的火力队跟在我们连的后面。整理好，我们就大踏步的走进了果木林。黄灿灿的梨，一串串火红的山楂，引得人们直流口水。不知谁从地下拣起一个山楂，还没来得及往嘴里填，就被人阻止了，责备他：“你吃一个山楂不要紧！可是它就能使我们的战斗失败”！
    刚走出果木林，便听到“砰！砰！”的枪声。我们放慢了脚步，迅速编成六路行军纵队，六挺机枪一字儿排在前边，连长发出了“齐步走”的口令，部队顿时威严起来。“擦！擦！”的脚步声，和枪声混杂在一起，揭开了“战斗”的序幕。
    部队接近村子的时候，连长回头向我点了点头说：“从现在开始，你就是指挥员了。指挥‘战斗’吧！”我就迅速的跨出了队列，学着排长的样子，喊了几声一二一，当人们的脚步已合节凑的时候，我就发出了“战斗”的号令：“枪口对外，齐步前进……”。跟着一个响彻云霄的歌声，像波涛似的，从尖兵连开始，席卷了全支队的行列，形成了一股震天动地的力量。
    联庄武装还在向我们射击，子弹不时地从我们身旁掠过，但是没有一个人去理它。各联庄的武装都赶来了，火力突然密集起来。我们的安全受到了威胁，但是我们的歌声没有停止，只不过是加上了一阵伴奏曲——火力队从侧面压制一下对方。我们毫不畏怯地前进。我们的“不伤老百姓，不打自己人”歌声传到那里，那里的敌人就解除了精神上的武装，响起了“不要打枪了！”“这是我们自己的队伍”的喊声。有些武装则整队的撤走了。
    同志们的疑虑消失了。我更是精神百倍，挥动着两臂，指挥着队伍，唱着“我们是铁的队伍，我们是铁的心，维护中华民族，永作自由人”，直向村口前进。枪声沉寂了，护村围子插上了白旗。歌声把日本统治下的村庄唤醒了，你瞧罢，男的、女的、老的、少的蜂踊在村旁，贪看着我们。
    就这样，我们的歌声从这村响到那村，到傍晚，我们就穿过联庄区的几十个村落，顺利地到达了目的地。
    撒下的种籽开了花。一个月后，我们回到联庄区的时候，遍地响起了“枪口对外，齐步前进”的歌声，村村有成千上百的人们欢迎我们。不久，就在这里组织起了人民的抗日队伍。
