    Attending the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs
    Delegates from Various Countries Arrive in Tokyo

    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 5th: Delegates from various countries are arriving in Tokyo one after another, preparing to attend the Third World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament, scheduled to open on the 6th.

    As of this afternoon, delegates from India, Burma, Indonesia, Ceylon, New Zealand, Australia, France, the United Kingdom, the United States, Austria, Peru, West Germany, Portugal, and the Vice-Chairman of the Women's International Democratic Federation, Andrée Andrée, had arrived in Tokyo.

    The Chinese delegation, headed by Cai Tingkai, which had previously encountered difficulties from the Japanese government in Hong Kong, and the Chilean representative, the famous poet Pablo Neruda, are scheduled to arrive in Tokyo tonight.

    The entry issue of the Soviet, Polish, and Czechoslovakian delegations was resolved on the 3rd due to the firm demands of the international preparatory center of the conference, with the Japanese government forced to concede. However, their travel schedule has been delayed as a result, and they will miss the opening session. At the same time, the Japanese government continues to unreasonably refuse entry to the delegations from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Mongolian People's Republic, and the German Democratic Republic to participate in this conference.

    An American delegate, Jake, said today, "I came here to express that many Americans want to stop nuclear weapons testing."

    出席禁止氢弹世界大会
    各国代表陆续抵达东京
    据新华社5日讯  东京消息：各国代表正在陆续到达东京，准备出席预定从6日开幕的第三届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会。
    到今天下午为止，已经到达东京的有印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚、锡兰、新西兰、澳大利亚、法国、英国、美国、奥地利、秘鲁、西德、葡萄牙等国家的代表和国际民主妇女联合会副主席安德琳。
    曾经在香港一度受到日本政府留难的以蔡廷锴为首的中国代表团，智利代表、著名诗人聂鲁达等预定在今天夜里到达东京。
    苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克三国代表团的入境问题，由于大会的国际筹备中心的坚决要求，日本政府被迫让步，在3日获得解决。但是，他们的行期已因此被拖延，将赶不上参加开幕会议。同时，日本政府仍然无理拒绝越南民主共和国、蒙古人民共和国和德意志民主共和国的代表团入境参加这次大会。
    一位美国代表捷柯今天发表谈话说：“我来到这里是要表示许多美国人需要停止试验核武器”。
