A close associate of Luo Longji, a rightist for more than ten years, Fan Guang played with fire and burned himself in Jiangsu

(Our newspaper's report) According to the *Xinhua Daily*, the Jiangsu Provincial Committee and the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League have held eight meetings over the past month to expose and criticize Fan Guang, deputy director of the organization department of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League and vice chairman of the Nanjing Municipal Committee, for participating in the Luo Longji clique, guiding the China Democratic League to turn to the right, and for his consistent anti-Communist and anti-socialist words and deeds. Now, the ugly face of this rightist element has been exposed.

At the end of April this year, after Fan Guang participated in the propaganda work conference of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and understood the intention of the rectification movement, he arbitrarily and hastily issued direct instructions and arranged nine "speaking out" symposiums to "sow seeds of fire," "select henchmen," and "collect materials for attack." At these meetings, Fan Guang "instructed" that "the League is a party representing the interests of intellectuals, and opinions can be expressed boldly," "not afraid of being radical," "not afraid of being one-sided," "not afraid of emotions"; and he supported them, saying, "Don't be afraid of retaliation, you can complain to the League Municipal Committee if you have any opinions." Sure enough, under Fan Guang's instigation, many rightist elements in the grassroots League organizations became even more rampant and became Fan Guang's shock troops in attacking the Communist Party.

Not only that, but Fan Guang also misappropriated the name of the CPPCC Cultural and Educational Work Group and held five symposiums, even inviting elementary school teachers whom he usually did not value. These meetings focused on "wages, personnel arrangements, and the side effects of previous movements" to "speak out," and he planted a time bomb here.

Fan Guang was afraid that the "speaking out" in the schools was not deep or thorough enough, so he convened a conference of grassroots cadres of the China Democratic League in secondary schools, which some League members called a "swearing-in rally to start fires." At this meeting, Fan Guang put forward an anti-Communist action program of "six major contradictions and four major demands." He said that in helping the Party to rectify its work, there were "six major contradictions" between the Party and the masses: first, the contradiction between the masses wanting to speak out quickly and the leaders wanting to speak out slowly, and that it should be quick to speak out; second, the contradiction between speaking out first and learning later and learning first and speaking out later, and that it should be speaking out first and learning later; third, the contradiction between speaking out with leadership and speaking out without leadership, and that it should be led, supported, and launched by the League; fourth, the contradiction between speaking out conditionally and speaking out unconditionally, and that it should be speaking out unconditionally; fifth, the coordination of the steps of the Party and the League, and that the League should take the first step, and if the Party branch is afraid to speak out, it should promote it; sixth, the contradiction between you speaking out and me contending, that we should speak out first and then contend, and that all opinions should not be refuted. Fan Guang was also afraid that League members would not understand his "spirit," so he "painstakingly" put forward "four major demands":

(1) League members should "speak out more thoroughly and more boldly" than the masses; (2) Grasp the ideological trends of the masses in a timely manner, and take the first step in the second stage; (3) Understand the main problems existing in the school in depth, put forward suggestions for improvement, and report to the League; (4) Raise opinions to the Party without any concerns, and whether or not you dare to speak out is a matter of principle.

His speech, full of gunpowder, had a "fire adding to the flames" effect when it was implemented at the grassroots level. Rightist elements attacked the Party even more frantically, as if the Communist Party was about to collapse, and their small group of rightist elements was simply about to "take the stage" to "clean up the mess."

While "setting fires," Fan Guang attempted to open a gap in the personnel system. He fabricated out of thin air that "personnel files are filled with three -isms." At the symposium held by the Guangming Daily reporter specially dispatched to Nanjing by Chu Anping to start fires, he maliciously attacked "the allocation of graduates and the transfer of cadres like matchmaking at random," and he advocated that "in the future, job transfers should open up a free market to improve quality" and that "principals should also be elected democratically."

Fan Guang "made his fortune" by engaging in organizational work and sectarian activities. The number of League members developed in Nanjing in the past year was more than the total number in the years since liberation. He proposed that the grassroots level should develop two to three times as many, saying that development was for the purpose of "supervision." He also said, "There are so-called 'Four King Kongs' among the senior intellectuals in Nanjing, and we must try every means to bring them over."

In order to collect "political capital," he tampered with the League's "development standards," saying that no matter who it was, as long as they were "willing," they could join the League. In this way, counter-revolutionary elements, convicts undergoing reform through labor, and people with unclear political backgrounds were also developed. Among the seven newly developed League members in secondary technical schools, two were rightist backbones and three had political problems.

According to the disclosed materials, Fan Guang and the Luo Longji clique began colluding as early as 1943 in Chongqing. For more than ten years, he had been engaged in sectarian activities within the League, attacking leftists and becoming a die-hard member of the Luo Longji clique. On the eve of liberation, he colluded with Luo Hanxian (a member of the Luo Longji clique) and used the reactionary theory of "Socialism and Democracy" of Zhang Dongsun, a metaphysical ghost and anti-Communist expert, to establish a theoretical system and prepare to establish the "Reconstruction Society" as an organizational force.

After liberation, Fan Guang usurped the leadership position of the Nanjing China Democratic League. He and Zhang Bojun sang the same tune, saying, "We are a 'Political Research Institute' here, a 'Political Climate Measuring Station,'" and said, "The plan we put forward to the Party is a 'scientific paper' of great value." What kind of plan did he put forward? In the "speaking out," what he was preparing to put forward was an anti-Communist plan to "reform the personnel system" and "rehabilitate" people. He wanted to re-evaluate the previous political movements, alarmingly saying, "Intellectuals who have been struggled against are now 'once bitten by a snake, ten years afraid of ropes.'"

Since the anti-rightist struggle, Fan Guang has made eight written self-criticisms, but he has not touched the depths of his soul. He tried to justify himself, saying, "The China Democratic League only has right-leaning thoughts and no rightist elements, Chen Minzhi is a 'leftist,' and I myself have turned from right to left," saying that "setting fires objectively has guilt, but in my mind, it is not conscious." All these tricks have failed, and as the movement deepens, more and more grassroots "henchmen" are surrendering their weapons. Fan Guang, this veteran rightist element, will not be able to get away with it no matter what.

    罗隆基的心腹　十多年的右派
　　樊光在江苏玩火自焚
    本报讯　据新华日报消息：一个多月来，民盟江苏省委、南京市委先后召开了八次会议，从各方面揭发和批判民盟江苏省委组织部副部长、南京市委副主委樊光参加罗隆基集团，引导民盟向右转的罪恶活动及其一贯反共反社会主义的言行。现在，这个右派分子的丑恶面目被揭露了。
    今年4月底，樊光参加中共江苏省委宣传工作会议，了解了整风意图后，便擅自急忙地直线下达，布置了九个“鸣放”座谈会，以“撒火种”、“挑选爪牙”、“搜集进攻材料”。樊光在这些会议上都“指示”说：“盟是代表知识分子利益的党，有意见可大胆地讲”，“不怕偏激”，“不怕片面”，“不怕有情绪”；并为他们撑腰说“不要怕报复，有意见可以告到盟市委”。果然，在樊光的煽动下，不少基层盟组织的右派分子就更加猖狂，成了樊光向共产党进攻的冲锋陷阵的打手。
    不仅如此，樊光还盗用政协文教工作组名义，召开了五次座谈会，连他平时不在眼下的小学教员也请了来。这些会议是以“工资、人事安排、历次运动的副作用等”为中心来“鸣放”的，他在这里埋下了一颗定时炸弹。
    樊光怕学校中“鸣放”得不深不透，便又召开了一次中等学校民盟基层干部大会，有些盟员称之为“放火誓师大会”。在这次会上，樊光提出“六大矛盾，四大要求”的反共行动纲领。他说在帮助党整风中，党和群众存在“六大矛盾”：第一、群众要快放与领导要慢放的矛盾，应该快放；第二、先放后学和先学后放的矛盾，应该先放后学；第三、有领导的放和无领导的放的矛盾，应该由盟来领导、支持和发动；第四、有条件地放和无条件地放的矛盾，应该无条件地放；第五、党、盟步骤协调问题，盟先走一步，如果党支部怕放，就推动他；第六、你放我争的矛盾，先放后争，对所有意见，不应提出驳斥。樊光还惟恐盟员不能领会他的“精神”，又“苦口婆心”地提出“四大要求”：
  （一）盟员要比群众“鸣得更彻底、放的更大胆”；（二）及时掌握群众思想动向，在第二阶段也要先走一步；（三）深入了解学校存在的主要问题，提出改进意见，向盟汇报；（四）要毫无顾虑地向党提意见，敢不敢放是立场问题。
    他这篇充满火药味的讲演贯彻到基层后，起了“火上加油”的作用。右派分子更加疯狂地向党进攻，好像共产党就要垮台了，他们这一小撮右派分子简直就要“上台”来“收拾残局”了。
    樊光在“放火”的同时，企图从人事制度上打开一个缺口。他无中生有地说：“人事材料袋里装满了三个主义”。在储安平特派到南京来点火的光明日报记者召开的座谈会上，他恶意地攻击“分配毕业生和调动干部像乱点鸳鸯谱”，他主张“以后职业调动，要开放自由市场，可以提高质量”、“校长也采用民主选举”。
    樊光是搞组织工作、宗派活动“起家”的。一年来南京发展的盟员等于解放数年来的总和还要多。他提出基层要发展二至三倍，他说发展就是为了“监督”。又说“南京高级知识分子中有所谓‘四大金刚’，要千方百计地把他们拉过来”。
    为了搜罗“政治资本”，篡改盟的“发展标准”，说不管什么人，只要“自愿”就可入盟。这样，反革命分子、劳改犯、政治面貌不清的人也被发展了。在中等技术学校新发展的七个盟员中，有两人是右派骨干，三人有政治问题。
    根据已揭露的材料，樊光和罗隆基集团早在1943年在重庆时就开始勾勾搭搭。十余年来，在盟内一直闹宗派活动，打击左派，成为罗隆基集团的死硬派。解放前夕，他和罗涵先（罗隆基集团分子）勾结，以玄学鬼和反共专家张东荪的“社会主义与民主主义”的反动理论来建立理论体系，并筹建“改建学社”，作为组织上的力量。
    解放后，樊光窃据了南京民盟的领导地位。他和章伯钧一鼻孔出气说：“我们这里是‘政治研究院’，是‘政治气候测量站’”，并说：“我们向党提出的方案就是价值很大的‘科学论文’”。他提的是什么方案呢？在“鸣放”中，他准备提的就是“改革人事制度”和“平反”的反共方案。他要重新估价历次政治运动，危言耸听地说：“知识分子被斗过的现在是‘一朝被蛇咬，十年见蛇惊’。”
    反右派斗争以来，樊光先后作了八次书面检讨，但没有接触到灵魂深处的东西。他为自己开脱说：“民盟只有右倾思想没有右派分子，陈敏之是‘左派’，我自己已由右向左转了”，说什么“放火客观上有罪行，但在我思想上，不是有意识的”。这一切花招都破产了，随着运动的深入，基层“打手”越来越多地缴械投降，樊光这个老牌右派分子，无论如何是混不过关的。
