Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, August 23rd: The National Work Symposium, attended by 105 representatives of the National People's Congress, concluded in Qingdao on the 6th.

The symposium began on July 20th. The representatives participating in the symposium included members of twenty-nine ethnic groups. They came to Qingdao to hold the symposium at the invitation of the Ethnic Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China and the Ethnic Committee of the National People's Congress after attending the Fourth Session of the First National People's Congress in Beijing.

Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai received the representatives participating in the symposium on the afternoon of the 5th and took a group photo with them.

On the afternoon of the 4th, Premier Zhou Enlai delivered a report to the representatives on several fundamental principles for handling ethnic issues. His report included: opposing two types of nationalism—Han chauvinism and local nationalism—on the basis of striving for the construction of the socialist motherland and strengthening the unity of the national family; national regional autonomy; national prosperity and social reform; national autonomous rights and nationalization; and other four issues.

This symposium reviewed the implementation of ethnic policies, exchanged experiences in ethnic work, and discussed some major issues in future ethnic work. These issues involved ethnic relations in the joint construction of the socialist motherland, the implementation of national regional autonomy, and the further development of economic and cultural construction in ethnic regions. The representatives also studied the initial drafts of the "Provisional Measures for Financial Management in National Autonomous Areas (Draft)" and the "Provisional Regulations on the Scope and Powers of Autonomous Organs in National Autonomous Areas in Managing Enterprises and Institutions (Draft)" jointly drafted by the Ethnic Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Finance. Everyone expressed basic agreement with the content of these two draft initial versions. After the meeting, these two draft initial versions will be revised by relevant agencies and submitted to the State Council for approval.

In their speeches, the representatives believed that the achievements in ethnic work in recent years have been very great. At present, national regional autonomy has been implemented in areas where 90% of the total population of minority nationalities live; more than 85% of minority nationality areas have basically completed the socialist transformation in terms of the ownership of the means of production; democratic reforms are underway in areas with a population of approximately two million; at the same time, the economy and culture of minority nationality areas have developed to varying degrees, and the people's lives have been improved and raised. With the great victory achieved in the socialist transformation, the unity of the people of all nationalities throughout the country has been greatly strengthened and developed. Everyone unanimously believed that these achievements in ethnic regions are the result of the correct leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and are inseparable from the mutual support of all nationalities in the national family. Based on the facts of their own personal experiences, the representatives sternly refuted the rightists' words and deeds against socialism, against the leadership of the Communist Party, and aimed at provoking national division. Everyone expressed that they must draw a clear line with the rightists and resolutely fight to the end.

In their speeches, the representatives also criticized the shortcomings in ethnic work. Some representatives pointed out that the autonomous rights of some autonomous organs have not been fully realized; some representatives pointed out that the equal rights of some minority nationalities living in mixed and scattered areas are still not respected; some representatives pointed out that in socialist construction and socialist transformation, the characteristics and needs of certain minority nationalities have not been sufficiently taken into account.

Ulanhu, Vice Premier of the State Council and Director of the Ethnic Affairs Commission, delivered a concluding speech at the meeting on the 5th. Liu Geping, Chairman of the Ethnic Committee of the National People's Congress, spoke on issues related to national regional autonomy and on the work for ethnic groups living in mixed and scattered areas. Wang Feng, Deputy Director of the Ethnic Affairs Commission, spoke on the main work carried out by the Ethnic Affairs Commission since 1956.

In his concluding speech, Ulanhu said that building a strong socialist industrial country is the common goal of the people of all nationalities in our country. Now the people of all nationalities are experiencing a socialist revolution, and the social outlook of all ethnic regions is undergoing profound changes. All nationalities in different stages of social development will develop into socialist nationalities. Facing such an era of great change, we must have a correct understanding in our thinking and be fully prepared in spirit in order to strive to promote all changes that are conducive to socialism and to the progress and development of all nationalities.

Ulanhu emphasized that the common establishment of a unified multi-ethnic country and the implementation of the policy of national regional autonomy by all nationalities in our country are in line with the actual situation in our country and the greatest interests of the people of all nationalities. In our unified country, the relationship between all nationalities is one of equality, unity, mutual assistance, and cooperation. Now, due to the victory achieved in the socialist transformation in the ownership of the means of production, this fraternal relationship between all nationalities has been greatly consolidated, and the common labor and common life relationship between members of all nationalities is also developing day by day. This new development of ethnic relations will inevitably promote mutual learning and mutual influence among members of all nationalities, which is beneficial to strengthening national unity and promoting the development and progress of all nationalities. At the same time, the new development of ethnic relations has also brought about some new problems that need to be studied and resolved. He said that all nationalities in our country should continuously strive to strengthen the unity of the motherland and the unity between all nationalities.

Ulanhu then pointed out the great achievements made in implementing national regional autonomy in our country. He said that now, on a nationwide scale, the main task of implementing the policy of national regional autonomy is to fully realize the autonomous rights of minority nationalities. In the future, we must persist in unremitting efforts in this regard. However, due to our lack of experience, it will take a certain amount of time to fully realize this task.

Ulanhu also particularly emphasized that the key to the achievements of all work in minority nationality areas lies in the leadership of the Party. In the past few years, the great achievements made in minority nationality areas have been the result of the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. He pointed out that in the future, we must further strengthen the Party's ideological leadership in minority nationality areas and strengthen the Party's political and ideological education work for people and cadres of all nationalities. All Party members should participate in this Party-wide rectification movement, earnestly examine subjectivism, sectarianism, and bureaucracy in their work, criticize bourgeois nationalist tendencies, and draw a strict line ideologically and politically with bourgeois rightists.

Ulanhu also said in his concluding speech that the many opinions put forward by everyone on ethnic work this time are mostly correct and conducive to strengthening national unity and improving ethnic work. We should welcome them and use them as a reference for future work. Of course, some opinions are very inappropriate and should be analyzed and criticized. (Abstract of Ulanhu's speech on page 4)

　　正确处理祖国统一领导和民族区域自治的关系
　　建设社会主义的各民族大家庭
　　民族工作座谈会在青岛举行周总理在会上作了报告
    新华社青岛23日电　有一百零五位全国人民代表大会代表参加的民族工作座谈会，6日在青岛结束。
    座谈会是从7月20日开始的。参加座谈的代表包括二十九个民族成份。他们是在北京出席第一届全国人民代表大会第四次会议后，应中华人民共和国民族事务委员会和全国人民代表大会民族委员会的邀请来到青岛举行座谈的。
    毛泽东主席和周恩来总理在5日下午接见了参加座谈的代表，并且同代表们一起照了像。
    周恩来总理4日下午在会上就处理民族问题的几个根本原则向代表们作了报告。他的报告包括：在努力于社会主义祖国的建设和加强民族大家庭的团结的共同事业的基础上反对两种民族主义——大汉族主义和地方民族主义，民族区域自治，民族繁荣和社会改革，民族自治权利和民族化等四个问题。
    这次座谈会检查了民族政策执行情况，交流了民族工作经验，讨论了今后民族工作中的一些重大问题。这些问题涉及到在共同建设社会主义祖国中的民族关系，贯彻实行民族区域自治，以及进一步发展民族地区的经济和文化建设事业等方面。代表们还研究了民族事务委员会和财政部共同草拟的“民族自治地方财政管理暂行办法（草案）”和“关于民族自治地方的自治机关管理企业事业的范围和职权的暂行规定（草案）”的初稿。大家对这两个草案初稿的内容表示基本上同意。这两个草案初稿会后将经过有关机关修改后报请国务院审定。
    代表们在发言中认为，几年来民族工作中的成绩是十分伟大的。现在全国已经有占少数民族聚居人口总数90％的地区实行了民族区域自治；有85％以上的少数民族地区，已经在生产资料所有制方面基本上完成了社会主义改造；有大约二百万人口的地区正在进行民主改革；同时，少数民族地区的经济和文化都有了不同程度的发展，人民的生活有了改善和提高。随着社会主义改造所取得的伟大胜利，全国各民族人民的团结也已经大大地加强和发展。大家一致认为，民族地区的这些成就，是共产党和毛主席的正确领导的结果，并且同民族大家庭中各民族的互相支援分不开的。代表们根据自己亲身经历的事实，严厉地驳斥了右派分子的反对社会主义、反对共产党领导和挑拨民族团结的言行。大家表示必须同右派分子划清界限，坚决斗争到底。
    代表们在发言中也批评了民族工作中的缺点。有的代表提出有些自治机关的自治权利还没有充分实现；有的代表提出有些杂居和散居的少数民族的民族平等权利还有不被尊重的情况；有的代表提出在社会主义建设和社会主义改造中，对某些少数民族的特点和需要还照顾不够。
    国务院副总理兼民族事务委员会主任乌兰夫5日在会上作了总结发言。全国人民代表大会民族委员会主任委员刘格平就有关民族区域自治问题、对民族杂居区和散居民族的工作问题讲了话。民族事务委员会副主任汪锋就民族事务委员会从1956年以来所进行的主要工作讲了话。
    乌兰夫在总结发言时说，建立一个强大的社会主义工业国，是我国各民族人民的共同目标。现在各民族人民正在经历一次社会主义革命，各民族地区的社会面貌发生着深刻的变化，一切处于不同社会发展阶段的民族都将发展成为社会主义民族。面临这样大变革的时代，我们在思想上要有正确的认识，精神上要有充分的准备，以便努力促进一切有利于社会主义和有利于各民族进步和发展的变化。
    乌兰夫强调指出，我国各民族共同建立统一的多民族国家，实行民族区域自治政策，乃是符合我国的实际情况和各民族人民的最大利益的。在我们统一的国家中，各民族间的关系，是平等、团结、互助、合作的兄弟关系。现在，由于社会主义改造在生产资料所有制方面已取得胜利，各民族间的这种兄弟关系已大大巩固，而各民族成员之间的共同劳动和共同生活关系也日益发展。民族关系这种新的发展，势必促进各民族成员间的互相学习，互相影响，这对于民族团结的加强和各民族的发展和进步，都是有利的。同时，民族关系的新发展也带来了一些新的问题，需要我们研究解决。他说，我国各民族都应当不断努力加强祖国大家庭的统一和各民族间的团结。
    乌兰夫接着指出了我国实行民族区域自治所取得的伟大成就。他说，现在就全国范围来说，贯彻民族区域自治政策的主要任务，是充分实现少数民族的自治权利。今后我们在这方面必须坚持不懈的努力。但是由于我们还缺乏经验，因此完全实现这一任务，还需要一定的时间。
    乌兰夫还特别强调说，少数民族地区一切工作的成就，关键在于党的领导。过去几年中，少数民族地区所以取得伟大的成绩，就是党和毛主席正确领导的结果。他指出，今后必须进一步加强党在少数民族地区的思想领导，加强党对各族人民和干部的政治思想教育工作。所有党员都应当参加此次全党的整风运动，认真检查在工作中的主观主义、宗派主义和官僚主义，批判资产阶级民族主义倾向，并且和资产阶级右派分子在思想上政治上严格划清界限。
    乌兰夫还在总结发言中表示，大家这次对民族工作提出的许多意见，绝大多数是正确的，对于加强民族团结和改进民族工作是有利的，我们应当表示欢迎，作为今后工作中的借鉴。当然，也有一些意见是很不适当的，应当分析和批判。（乌兰夫的发言摘要见第四版）
