Xinhua News Agency, 16th Dispatch: According to today's news from the "Teacher's Daily," many newly built and expanded middle and primary schools will appear across the country after the start of the school year this summer. According to preliminary estimates, 2,898,960 students will study in these newly built schools (including the number of primary school students enrolled in counties and cities below, which will be resolved by local investment). This year, the state plans to invest a total of 111,743,000 yuan in the construction and expansion of primary and secondary schools. The total construction area of newly built and expanded primary and secondary schools this year is 293,071 square meters (the above does not include local investment).

The large number of newly built primary and secondary schools are distributed in areas with weak educational foundations in the past and in minority areas. Luqu County and Maqu County in the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, as well as Subei Mongol Autonomous County and Aksai Kazakh Autonomous County and other pastoral areas, which have never had schools in history, now have primary schools. In Yongding County, an old revolutionary base area in Fujian Province, people have not been to school for more than 20 years since the Red Army went north to fight against the Japanese. Now the county has more than 100 primary schools, and on average, one in every four people in the county can go to school. This year, Fujian Province has basically achieved the goal of having middle schools in every county and primary schools in every village, with more than 80% of primary schools distributed in rural areas. In the Dalian-Lushun area, not only does every township have a primary school, but this year even more than a dozen small islands in Changhai County, which are located overseas, have established primary schools.

Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and other places where education was relatively developed have also correspondingly increased many newly built primary and secondary schools this year.

Beijing has newly built 16 middle schools, expanded 27 middle schools, and expanded 25 middle school classes; newly built 7 primary schools, and expanded 148 primary schools; newly built one normal school, and expanded one normal college and one normal school each. In addition, nine middle school classes have been expanded into middle schools; some agencies, enterprises, factories and mines, and construction units in Beijing have also invested in the construction of 14 new primary schools to accommodate more than 120 classes in order to resettle relocated households. More than half of the newly built primary and secondary schools are distributed in rural suburbs. The area of newly built and expanded schools is more than 90,000 square meters, accommodating more than 38,000 students.

This year, Shanghai plans to newly build and expand 64 primary and secondary schools of various types. The number of primary and secondary school students in school this year will increase to 1.1 million, exceeding any previous year. In the year before the Anti-Japanese War, there were only more than 210,000 primary and secondary school students in Shanghai, and only more than 400,000 on the eve of liberation.

Chongqing has newly built 24 middle schools, expanded 36 middle schools, and newly built and expanded 47 primary schools in various districts. This year, the investment in the construction and expansion of primary and secondary schools reached more than 5 million yuan, almost half of the total investment in the five years from 1952 to 1956.

This year, local agencies, organizations, factories, mines, and enterprises are also raising funds to run schools, and schools run by the masses are also increasing day by day. The number of students in various types of schools at all levels run by factories, enterprises, and mass organizations in Shanghai has reached more than 100,000. This year, private primary schools in Shandong Province can enroll 50,000 students.

This year, all localities have paid attention to implementing the spirit of diligence and thrift, and running schools diligently and frugally when building and expanding primary and secondary schools. Many schools have been established by repairing old houses and adopting simple methods.

    全国将增加一批新的中小学校
    国家计划投资一亿一千多万元  可容学生二百八十多万
    新华社16日讯  据“教师报”今天消息，今年暑期开学以后，全国将出现许多所新建和扩建的中、小学校。据初步估计，将有二百八十九万八千九百六十名学生在这些新建的学校里学习（其中包括县、市以下由地方投资解决的小学入学人数）。今年国家计划投资新建和扩建中小学的资金共计一亿一千七百四十三万元，今年新建和扩建的中、小学建筑面积共计二十九万三千零七十一平方公尺（以上都不包括地方投资）。
    为数巨大的新建的中、小学，分布在过去教育基础薄弱的地区和少数民族地区。历史上从来没有过学校的甘南藏族自治州碌曲县和玛曲县，以及肃北蒙族自治县和阿克塞哈萨克族自治县等牧业地区，都有了小学。福建省老根据地永定县许多革命据点，自从红军北上抗日以后，二十多年来，人民从来没有进过学校。现在这个县已有小学一百多所，全县平均每四个人中就有一人能进学校。今年，福建全省已基本达到县县有中学，村村有小学，80％以上的小学都分布在农村。旅大地区现在不但已经乡乡有小学，今年连僻处海外的长海县十多个小岛也都建立了小学。
    原来教育比较发达的北京、上海、重庆等地，今年也相应地增加了许多新建的中、小学。
    北京市今年新建中学十六所，扩建中学二十七所，扩建中学班二十五所；新建小学七所，扩建小学一百四十八所；新建师范一所，扩建师范学院、师范学校各一所。此外有九所中学班扩建成了中学；北京市有些机关、企业、厂矿及建设单位，为安置迁移的住户，也投资新建了小学十四所，可容一百二十多班。新建的中、小学分布在郊区农村的占一半以上。新建和扩建学校的面积九万多平方公尺；可容学生三万八千多人。
    今年上海计划新建、扩建各类中、小学六十四所，今年在校的中、小学生将增至一百一十万人，超过以往任何一年。在抗日战争前一年，上海中、小学生只有二十一万多人，解放前夕，也不过四十多万人。
    重庆市今年新建中学二十四所，扩建中学三十六所，各区新建和扩建的小学也有四十七所。今年中、小学新建和扩建的投资达五百多万元，几乎占1952年至1956年五年总投资的一半。
    今年各地机关、团体、厂矿、企业也集资捐款办学，群众自办的学校也一天天多起来。上海工厂企业和群众团体举办的各级各类学校，在校学生数已达十多万人。山东省民办小学今年可招生五万人。
    今年，各地在新建和扩建中小学时，都注意贯彻了勤俭节约、艰苦办学的精神，不少学校是采取修理旧房，因陋就简等办法建立起来的。
