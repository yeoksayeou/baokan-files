	"Peace and prosperity under heaven are complete lies to gloss over reality," said the cuttlefish. "As the saying goes, seeing is believing, so I go everywhere to investigate. Everywhere I have investigated is nothing but pitch black, a dark and chaotic world. Newspapers only report good news and not the bad. People with integrity should not echo these sentiments, and should not shy away from the suspicion of arson. We must speak from the heart and let everyone understand what the actual situation is."

	The actual situation was that the cuttlefish was caught, just as it was releasing a cloud of pitch-black ink from its little sac. The trick was exposed, and now only the final denial remains:

	"What does the pitch-black ink have to do with me? Isn't my skin snow-white?"

    乌贼

    “河清海宴，那完全是粉饰太平的谎话。”乌贼说。“常言说得好，耳闻不如目睹，所以我到处考察。凡是我考察过的地方，没有一处不是漆黑一团，昏天黑地。报纸报喜不报忧，有骨气的人都不应该随声附和，不应该躲避到处放火的嫌疑，咱们要凭良心说话，让大家明白实际情况是怎么一回事。”
    实际情况是乌贼给人逮住了，正当它从小囊里放出漆黑一团的墨汁的时候。鬼把戏给拆穿了，如今只剩下抵赖的尾声：
    “一团漆黑的墨汁与我何干？难道我的皮肉不是雪白的吗？”
