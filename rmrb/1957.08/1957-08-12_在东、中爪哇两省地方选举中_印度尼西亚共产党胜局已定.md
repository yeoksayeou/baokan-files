Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 10th: The victory of the Indonesian Communist Party in the local council elections in Central Java Province is largely a foregone conclusion. According to recent incomplete statistics, the Indonesian Communist Party received more than 2.1 million votes in the Central Java regency and city council elections; and more than 2.5 million votes in the provincial council elections. It has surpassed the Nationalist Party, which received the most votes in the local area in the 1955 Constitutional Assembly elections. In this local council election, the Nationalist Party has fallen to second place, with the Islamic Teachers Association and the Masyumi Party ranking third and fourth respectively.
