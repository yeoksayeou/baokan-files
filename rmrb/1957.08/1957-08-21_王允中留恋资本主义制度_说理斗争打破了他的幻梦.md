　　Wang Yunzhong Longs for the Capitalist System
    Reasoned Struggle Shatters His Illusions

    (Our report) The entire staff of the Shandong Provincial Department of Commerce has launched a reasoned struggle against Wang Yunzhong, a rightist within the Party and a staff member in the Finance Section of the Department of Commerce.

    Wang Yunzhong longed for the capitalist social system, advocating bourgeois "freedom" and "democracy" in China. He said, "I am fundamentally dissatisfied with the current social phenomena." He also yearned for life in Shanghai under Kuomintang rule, saying, "In that society, today you might be a pauper, tomorrow you could be a millionaire." He opposed the Party's "Three Great Transformations" policy, saying, "Capitalism has competition, which can stimulate production; the socialist system is egalitarian, without competition, and cannot stimulate production." Regarding the socialist transformation of agriculture, he believed: "Agricultural collectivization has been done badly; many farmers have no food to eat, and many farmers have no money to spend. Those district and township cadres cannot implement the Party's policies." He also undermined the Party's prestige among the people everywhere, saying, "The Communist Party, like other class-based political parties, is also a group striving to win over the masses, seize power, and share wealth."

    Wang Yunzhong vehemently opposed the Party's cadre policy of "both virtue and talent." He said that personnel departments promoted cadres based on "as long as they are senior and have a 'brand' (referring to Party membership), and are good at talking, they can be promoted." He also maliciously spread rumors, saying, "The personnel department is like a donkey driver, and those doing the work are like donkeys. Those who are donkeys will always be donkeys, and those who drive donkeys will always drive donkeys." He also used methods such as inviting people to dinner to win over some people to launch a massive attack on the Party.

    In several reasoned struggles, Wang Yunzhong was rendered speechless and unable to answer in the face of many concrete facts.

　　王允中留恋资本主义制度
    说理斗争打破了他的幻梦
    本报讯　连日来，山东省商业厅全体工作人员，对党内右派分子、商业厅财务处科员王允中展开了说理斗争。
    王允中留恋资本主义社会制度，主张在中国实行资产阶级的“自由”和“民主”。他说：“我对目前的社会现象从根本上不满意。”他还一心向往着国民党统治时代的上海生活，他说：“在那个社会里，今天是穷光棍，明天可能就是百万富翁。”他反对党的“三大改造”政策，他说：“资本主义有竞争，可以刺激生产；社会主义制度是平均的，没有竞争，不能刺激生产。”对农业社会主义改造，他认为：“农业合作化搞糟了，有很多农民没有粮食吃，很多农民没钱花。那些区乡干部不能贯彻党的政策。”他还到处败坏党在人民群众中的威信，他说：“共产党和其他阶级的政党一样，也是为了争取群众，夺取政权，分享富贵的集团。”
    王允中对党的“德才兼备”的干部政策大加反对。他说人事部门提拔干部是“只要是老资格加牌子（指党员），会说能道的就能提拔。”他还恶毒的宣传说，“人事部门是赶驴的，搞业务的是当驴的，当驴的永远当驴，赶驴的永远赶驴。”他还用请客吃饭等手法，拉拢一些人大肆向党进攻。
    在几次说理斗争中，王允中在许多具体事实面前，被驳得张口结舌，无言以答。
