　　People Who Don't Show Their True Colors
　　Peng Lizhao
    There was a student at the Beijing Russian Language Institute named Liu Enxiang. During the rightists' attack on the Party, he played a shameful role. He often acted furtively, never showing his face, anonymously writing anti-Communist letters and anti-Communist big-character posters.

      On July 21st, Xu Jiaming, a classmate of Liu Enxiang, borrowed a book from him and suddenly discovered a draft of a letter to the rightist Tan Tianrong tucked inside. This is how his fox's tail was caught.

    Under everyone's criticism and exposure, Liu Enxiang successively handed over the drafts of some anti-Communist letters, big-character posters, and small-character posters he had written.

    Liu Enxiang, using the pseudonym "Shi Yang," wrote to Ge Peiqi, saying:

  "I saw your speech in the newspaper, and I am extremely happy. You represent us intellectuals." He also said: "Your speech not only represents a portion of people but also a large portion of people, representing those who demand the truth." He greatly admired the rightists' anti-Communist and anti-socialist remarks. He said: "We believe these are not reactionary remarks but progressive remarks, revolutionary remarks." Finally, he said: "I hope you are not afraid of external attacks; there are millions of people behind you."

    Liu Enxiang, using the pseudonym "Jin Dao," wrote to Tan Tianrong, saying: "...Currently, our situation is difficult, and we have been counterattacked... Our blooming and contending has failed. The reason for the failure is that we do not have a complete theory to demonstrate the root causes of the 'three evils,' nor do we have reliable facts. Therefore, in the future, we should find more facts, observe more, and research more..."

    Liu Enxiang wrote to his close friend Wang Yusheng, saying: "...In late May, a nationwide student movement erupted. Now I cannot extricate myself; I cannot lose this opportunity; I must persevere in the struggle to the end."

    Liu Enxiang, forgetting sleep and meals, wrote many big-character posters and small-character posters, viciously attacking the Party and cursing those who actively participated in the anti-rightist struggle. He, using the pseudonym "A Deceived Person," wrote: "Aren't the remarks of Zhang Bojun, Chu Anping, Zhang Naiqi, and Ge Peiqi precisely what millions of people want to say?" "The moment for action has arrived; we should give the conservatives a powerful counterattack." He also wrote: "We fully support the fourteen-point program of the China Democratic League and the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party branch at the Beijing Russian Language Institute." In a big-character poster under the pseudonym "A College Student," he wrote: "We must engage in a life-and-death struggle with the rulers." In an unsigned big-character poster, he wrote: "Living in this man-eat-man world is worse than death. No! We cannot die in vain; we must fight the strong (referring to the Communist Party) and offer my last drop of blood." He also used the most vicious words to insult the activists, saying their "hearts and brains are of unknown composition."

    Liu Enxiang came from a small merchant family, was infected with many bad habits of petty merchants, often mixed with backward elements, did not concentrate on his studies at school, swindled and deceived, and his bad thoughts were not fundamentally reformed. During the anti-rightist struggle, he secretly cheered for the rightists.

    People must be vigilant! Some rightists are not those who come out into the open!

　　不露真名的人
　　彭利钊
    北京俄语学院有个学生叫刘恩祥。在右派分子向党进攻声中充当了一个可耻的角色。他经常躲躲闪闪，自己不出头露面，匿名写反共信件和反共大字报。
      7月21日，刘恩祥的同班同学徐家明，向他借一本书，忽然发现书中夹着一封给右派分子谭天荣的信的底稿。他的狐狸尾巴就是这样被抓住了。
    刘恩祥在大家的批判和揭发下，陆续交出了他写的一些反共信件和反共大字报、小字报的底稿。
    刘恩祥化名示羊给葛佩琦写信说：
  “我从报纸上看到了你的发言，我真高兴极了，你代表我们这些书生们”。又说：“你的发言不但代表一部分人，而且代表一大部分人，代表要求真理的人们”。他对右派分子反共、反社会主义的言论倍加欣赏。他说：“我们认为这不是反动言论，而是进步言论，而是革命言论”。最后说：“希望你不要怕外人攻击，有千百万人做你的后盾。”
    刘恩祥化名金刀给谭天荣写信说：“……目前我们的处境困难，我们遭到了反击……，我们的鸣放失败了，失败的原因就是我们没有完整的理论来论证三害产生的根源，也没有可靠的事实。因此，今后我们应多找事实，多观察，多研究。……”
    刘恩祥给他的密友王玉生写信说：“……5月下旬，爆发了全国性的学生运动。现在我不能脱身，我不能失去这个机会，要在斗争中坚持到底。”
    刘恩祥废寝忘食，先后写了许多向党恶毒进攻，咒骂积极参加反右派斗争的人们的大字报和小字报。他化名“一个受骗者”写道：“章伯钧、储安平、章乃器和葛佩琦等人的言论，还不是正是千百万人民要说的话吗？”“行动的时刻到了，我们应该给保守分子以有力的反击”，又写道：“北京俄语学院民盟农工党支部的十四纲领，我们完全拥护”。他在化名为“一个大学生”的一张大字报里写道：“我们要和统治者进行生死斗争”。他在一张没有署名的大字报里写道：“生活在这人吃人的世界上，不如死去。不！不能白死，要与强者（指共产党）拼一场，献出我最后的一滴血”。他还用最恶毒的字眼辱骂积极分子“心和大脑不知是什么构成的”。
    刘恩祥出身于小商人家庭，沾染了小商人的许多坏习气，经常和落后分子混在一起，在学校里不安心学习，招摇撞骗，坏思想没有得到根本改造，在反右派斗争中，他还暗地为右派分子打气。
    人们要警惕啊，有些右派分子不是出头露面的！
