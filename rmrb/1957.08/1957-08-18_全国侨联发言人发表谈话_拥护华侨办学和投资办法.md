Xinhua News Agency, 17th: The spokesperson for the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese issued a statement to the China News Service on the 16th regarding the "Measures for Overseas Chinese to Donate Funds to Establish Schools" and the "Preferential Measures for Overseas Chinese Investing in State-Owned Overseas Chinese Investment Companies" promulgated by the State Council. The spokesperson first expressed complete support for the above two measures and sincerely thanked the Communist Party and the government for their care and consideration for overseas Chinese.

The spokesperson said that although overseas Chinese are far from their motherland, they have always loved their motherland and their hometowns. Since liberation, the socialist construction of the motherland has progressed rapidly, and its international status has been elevated to an unprecedented level, realizing the true independence and prosperity of the motherland, which has further inspired the patriotic enthusiasm of the vast number of overseas Chinese. Overseas Chinese have deep feelings for every tree and blade of grass in their hometowns and have always cared for and generously supported social welfare and cultural and educational undertakings in their hometowns. For example, Xiamen University and Jimei Schools, founded by Chen Jiageng, chairman of this federation, and some schools founded by other overseas Chinese leaders in various parts of Guangdong and Fujian, are all well known. Overseas Chinese donations to schools not only help solve the problem of schooling for overseas Chinese children, but also play a certain role in improving the level of cultural education in overseas Chinese hometowns and cultivating talents for the country, which has been well received by public opinion and praised by the government.

The spokesperson said: The "Measures for Overseas Chinese to Donate Funds to Establish Schools" promulgated by the State Council on August 2nd clearly stipulate the school construction plan, source of funds, school name, education policy, the organization of the school board, the appointment and removal of the principal, the working report system, the political treatment of teachers and staff, the priority admission of dependents of overseas Chinese and overseas Chinese students, as well as the government's support and assistance for the school construction plan, the leadership of educational administrative work in overseas Chinese schools, and the commendation and reward of those who are enthusiastic about running schools and have made outstanding achievements. It is believed that this will greatly encourage the enthusiasm of overseas Chinese to donate funds to establish schools, further promote the fine tradition of overseas Chinese running welfare undertakings and cultural undertakings in their hometowns, not only enable overseas Chinese-run schools to develop more rapidly and greatly, but also promote overseas Chinese to run various welfare undertakings in their hometowns.

Speaking about the issue of overseas Chinese investment, the spokesperson said that overseas Chinese have a long history of engaging in industry and commerce in their countries of residence and have contributed to the prosperity and economic development of those countries. They will continue to participate in the national industrial construction of the local areas with the approval of the local governments. However, overseas Chinese love their motherland. They are proud of the great achievements of the socialist construction of the motherland and the improvement of the motherland's international status in recent years, so their desire to return to the country to invest and participate in the construction of the motherland is also very natural. Since 1956, Guangdong and Fujian have successively established overseas Chinese investment companies to accept investments from returned overseas Chinese dependents and overseas Chinese to participate in the local industrial construction of the two provinces. By the end of 1956, overseas Chinese investments in the two provinces had created more than 40 factories and enterprises. This is a clear example. The promulgation of this preferential treatment method for overseas Chinese investment more powerfully proves the government's care and preferential treatment for guiding overseas Chinese and Hong Kong and Macao compatriots to invest. This will further encourage the enthusiasm of overseas Chinese and Hong Kong and Macao compatriots to invest and participate in the construction of the motherland.

    全国侨联发言人发表谈话
    拥护华侨办学和投资办法
    新华社17日讯  中华全国归国华侨联合会 发言人16日就国务院命令公布的“华侨捐资兴办学校办法”和“华侨投资于国营华侨投资公司的优待办法”向中国新闻社记者发表谈话。发言人首先对上述两个办法表示完全拥护，并衷心地感谢共产党和政府对华侨关怀和照顾。
    发言人说，华侨虽然远离祖国，但是他们一贯热爱祖国、热爱家乡。解放以后，祖国的社会主义建设事业一日千里，国际地位空前提高，实现了祖国真正的独立和富强，更加鼓舞了广大侨胞的爱国热忱。华侨对家乡的一草一木都有浓厚的感情，对家乡的社会福利和文教事业，一贯关怀，慷慨资助。如本会主席陈嘉庚所创办的厦门大学、集美学校，其他侨领在广东、福建各地兴办的一些学校，都是大家所熟知的。华侨捐资办学，不仅对解决华侨子弟的就学问题有帮助，而且对于提高侨乡的文化教育水平，为国家培养人材，都起了一定的作用，得到社会舆论的好评和政府的表扬。
    发言人说：国务院8月2日公布的“华侨捐资兴办学校办法”，对于建校计划、经费来源、学校名称、教育政策、校董会的组织、校长任免、工作报告制度、教职员政治待遇、优先录取侨眷子弟和华侨学生，以及政府对于建校计划的支持协助，对侨校教育行政工作的领导，对热心办学卓有成绩者的表扬奖励等方面，都作了明文规定。相信这样必将大大鼓舞华侨捐资办学的热情，进一步发挥华侨在家乡兴办福利事业、文化事业的优良传统，不仅使侨办学校有更加迅速、巨大的发展，而且将促进华侨在家乡举办多种福利事业。
    发言人谈到华侨投资问题时说，华侨在侨居国从事工商业是有悠久的历史的，对当地的繁荣和经济的发展都有贡献。他们将继续在当地政府的赞同下，参加当地的民族工业建设。但是，华侨是热爱祖国的。他们对祖国几年来社会主义建设的伟大成就和祖国国际地位的提高而感到自豪，因而他们对回国投资参加祖国建设的愿望也是很自然的。从1956年广东、福建就先后成立华侨投资公司，接受归侨侨眷和华侨的投资，参加两省地方的工业建设。至1956年底，两省华侨投资创建的工厂和企业有四十多个。这便是一个明显的事例。这一优待华侨投资办法的公布，更有力地证明了政府对于辅导华侨及港澳同胞投资的照顾和优待。这将更加鼓舞华侨及港澳同胞投资参加祖国建设的热情。
