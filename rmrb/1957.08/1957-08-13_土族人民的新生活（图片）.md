The Tu people in Qinghai and Gansu provinces have lived in the Qinghai Plateau for generations, diligently engaged in agricultural and pastoral labor. In the past, they were unable to eat enough or keep warm, and they could not even use their own language.

After liberation, the Party and the government led the Tu people to implement land reform, established the Huzhu Tu Autonomous County, and launched the agricultural collectivization movement, achieving full collectivization throughout the county by 1955. The state also helped the Tu people to build water conservancy projects and improve farming techniques, resulting in a bumper harvest last year and a significant improvement in their living standards. Currently, the state is helping them to create their own written language.

	The Tu people have a rich oral literature. In the past, they had no written language, so oral literature was very important. The elderly passed it on to the young people, passing it down from generation to generation. This is Najia Agricultural Cooperative member Sha Decheng teaching oral literature to young people.

    土族人民的新生活
    青海和甘肃境内的土族人民，世居青海高原，辛勤地从事着农、牧业劳动。过去他们吃不饱，穿不暖，连本民族语言也不能用。
    解放后，党和政府领导土族人民实行了土地改革，建立了互助土族自治县，展开了农业合作化运动，到1955年，做到了全县合作化。国家还帮助土族人民兴修水利，改进耕作技术，因而去年获得了丰收，生活有了很大提高。现在，国家正在帮助他们创造本民族的文字。

    土族人民有丰富的口头文学。他们过去没有文字，口头文学就显得十分重要了，老人传给青年人，一代一代的传下来。这是纳家农业社的社员沙得成向青年人传授口头文学。
