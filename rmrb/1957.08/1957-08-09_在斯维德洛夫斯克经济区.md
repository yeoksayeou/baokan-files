    In the Sverdlovsk Economic Region
    By our correspondent Li He
    What is the situation after the establishment of economic administrative regions in various parts of the Soviet Union? What are the National Economic Committees of the various economic regions doing? What are the manifestations of local and mass enthusiasm? To understand these issues, I visited the Sverdlovsk Economic Region.

    One of 105
    The economic region formed by the Sverdlovsk Oblast is one of the most industrially developed of the 105 economic regions in the Soviet Union. The Urals are the backbone of Soviet heavy industry, and the Sverdlovsk Oblast is the pearl of the Urals. The area of this oblast is equivalent to two Austrias, with a population of 3.7 million (85% living in cities). The oblast has 1,320 industrial enterprises, producing 33 billion rubles worth of industrial products annually. The steel produced here accounts for 11% of the total Soviet output, aluminum 43%, refined copper 40%, and machinery 12%.

    The industry of Sverdlovsk Oblast has developed rapidly in the last two or three decades. Last year, the total industrial output of the oblast was seventy times that of 1913. Before the focus of management shifted from the central government to the local level, the oblast's one thousand plus industrial enterprises were led by sixty-three all-Union and republic industrial ministries and bureaus. This hindered further development of production, especially specialization and collaboration. Only the establishment of the economic region and the unified management of industrial enterprises by the National Economic Committee fundamentally eliminated this obstacle.

    After the Reorganization
    The structure of the National Economic Committees in the various economic regions of the Soviet Union is flexible, varying in complexity according to the industrial level of each region. The Sverdlovsk Economic Region has a highly concentrated industry, and its National Economic Committee has a relatively large structure. It includes the following specialized administrations: Iron and Steel, Non-ferrous Metals, Machine Building, Electrical Equipment, Chemical Industry, Building Materials, Construction, Fuel, Timber, Wood Processing and Paper Making, Light Industry, Food Industry, etc. In addition, there are fifteen sections and departments, including Planning Economics, Technology, Production and Collaboration, Labor and Wages, etc.

    When I visited this National Economic Committee, the cadres there were already in place, although the staffing was not yet full. The cadres came from three sources: a small number from the abolished central industrial ministries, and the majority from local enterprises and institutions. Stepanov, the chairman of the National Economic Committee, was the former Minister of Transport Machine Building of the Soviet Union; Sokolov, the first vice-chairman, was the former Deputy Minister of the Iron and Steel Industry of the Soviet Union; and many of the bureau chiefs were former deputy ministers of all-Union or republic industrial ministries. The Iron and Steel Industry Administration has a staff of 115, of which 105 have already been selected, many of whom are cadres from the former Ural Iron and Steel Administration and the former Ural Iron Ore Trust.

    The characteristics of the new institution are: fewer levels and closer proximity to production. Stepanov told me: "The institution has just been established. The staff are still unfamiliar with each other and not very familiar with the situation of the enterprises. However, the factories are right in front of us, and we can go down to them at any time, which was impossible when the management organization was in Moscow." This is indeed the case. Take the steel factories and iron mines in this oblast as an example. Previously, these enterprises belonged to twelve general bureaus, trusts, and departments, most of which were far away in Moscow. Although the Ural Iron and Steel Administration was located in Sverdlovsk, it had to lead many enterprises distributed throughout the Ural region. This situation naturally did not allow for timely and efficient problem solving. Now, all the oblast's steel plants, refractory brick plants, coking chemical plants, steel pipe plants, steel finished product plants, and iron mines are uniformly led by the Iron and Steel Industry Administration of the National Economic Committee. This主管机关 (zhǔguǎn jīguan - competent authority) is close to the production enterprises.

    Mergers and Streamlining
    The National Economic Committee of the Sverdlovsk Economic Region has only been established for a month. Its office building is still under renovation, and its staff is not yet complete, but its work has already begun actively. It has not only taken over numerous enterprises but also led some management agencies and enterprises to carry out reasonable mergers and streamlining. In the past, when management agencies and enterprises belonged to multiple departments, such mergers and streamlining were unimaginable.

    Based on suggestions made during the nationwide discussion of the reorganization plan for the industrial management system, the National Economic Committee merged the cement plant and the slate factory. This greatly streamlined administrative staff, improved equipment utilization, and ensured the smooth completion of production and planning. In the steel industry, the merger of iron mines and steel plants is also of great significance. Unifying the leadership of iron mines and steel plants will eliminate the phenomenon of production decoupling. Similar mergers will also be carried out in several non-ferrous metal plants and mines. Construction agencies are also undergoing extensive mergers and streamlining. The two parallel construction trusts in the oblast were merged into one. A unified construction agency was established in the city of Sverdlovsk, thus abolishing fifteen construction and installation units. Due to mergers and streamlining, this economic region will release 370 administrative staff from construction agencies, saving 3.5 million rubles a year.

    The oblast has many industrial enterprises, and 107 state farms are dedicated to supplying them with milk, vegetables, and other agricultural and livestock products. The state farm trust used to have seventeen offices and supply bureaus, including 342 personnel to manage these enterprises. Currently, the National Economic Committee has decided to organize a unified workers' supply trust, which will streamline 200 personnel and allow them to participate in production.

    Strengthening Ties with the Masses
    From the first month of activity of the Sverdlovsk National Economic Committee, a new atmosphere of strengthening the connection between industrial management agencies and the masses of workers can be clearly seen.

    The mass advisory body attached to the National Economic Committee, the Technical and Economic Committee, has been established. It will hold meetings every one or two months to discuss general issues, such as the discharge of factory water and maintaining the cleanliness of urban rivers; and to discuss the specialization and collaboration of professional departments. It will widely listen to the opinions of the masses, make suggestions, and submit them to the National Economic Committee. The Technical and Economic Committee here has already selected 98 members. They represent various aspects of society. Among them are well-known production innovators, designers, technicians, economic workers, factory directors, and chief engineers from many factories in the economic region; leaders at all levels of the National Economic Committee; and representatives from the oblast's Party, trade union, Soviet, and scientific circles.

    The National Economic Committee also listens to the opinions of the masses through meetings of economic activists in various industrial enterprises. When I was in Sverdlovsk, the iron and steel industry and the machine-building industry of this economic region successively held such activist meetings. Participants in these meetings included advanced workers, engineers, factory directors, and factory Party and trade union workers. The chairman and bureau chiefs of the National Economic Committee also went to the factories to participate.

    Because the new institution is close to production, the connection between upper and lower levels is closer than before. For example, in July, the vast majority of factory directors in the machine-building industry came to the Machine Building Administration of the National Economic Committee, and the staff of this bureau also often went to the factories. Factories in the same industry did not communicate with each other in the past because they belonged to different industrial ministries; now, factory directors in the same industry organize joint inspections, learn from each other's strengths, and work together to identify shortcomings.

    Formulating the 1958 Plan
    After two months of major reforms in the Soviet industrial management system, the management agencies and personnel have undergone great changes, but the plan for the first half of 1957 was completed as usual. The situation in Sverdlovsk Oblast is also the same. This shows the soundness of Soviet industrial enterprises and the superiority of the socialist system. Now, the Sverdlovsk Economic Region, like other economic regions, is beginning to formulate the 1958 production plan.

    In previous years, the production plan was formulated and prescribed by the higher-level planning agencies; now, the production plan is formulated directly in the enterprises. When formulating the 1958 production plan, the conditions and possibilities of the enterprises, as well as the opinions put forward by the workers during the nationwide discussion of the industrial management policy, are carefully considered. The staff of the National Economic Committee goes to the factories to assist the enterprises in formulating the plan. In implementing this year's plan, the Sverdlovsk Economic Region and other regions maintain their original production and supply relationships. Because carelessly changing the production plan would cause chaos and losses. The 1958 plan will consider how to produce and supply more rationally and consider the issue of cooperation with other economic regions. In short, each economic region will actively exploit its local potential.

    Stepanov said modestly: The National Economic Committee has taken its first step. At present, we cannot talk about any achievements in our work. What we are doing is new. There are also many industrial enterprises here. There are also many difficulties at present. However, the merger of some factories and mines will certainly have a huge effect, because it not only streamlines personnel but also makes production smooth. The next step is to study the specialization and collaboration of production.

### 在斯维德洛夫斯克经济区

    在斯维德洛夫斯克经济区
    本报记者　李何
    苏联各地经济行政区成立后的情形怎样？各个经济区的国民经济委员会在做些什么事情？地方和群众的积极性的发挥有那些表现？为了了解这些问题，我访问了斯维德洛夫斯克经济区。
    一百零五个中的一个
    由斯维德洛夫斯克州成立的经济区是苏联一百零五个经济区中工业最发达的之一。乌拉尔是苏联重工业的脊背，而斯维德洛夫斯克州又是乌拉尔的珍珠。这个州的面积相当于两个奥地利，人口三百七十万（85％住在城市）。全州有一千三百二十个工业企业，一年出产价值三百三十亿卢布的工业品。这里生产的钢铁占全苏产量11％，铝占43％，精炼铜占40％，机器占12％。
    斯维德洛夫斯克州的工业是在最近二、三十年间飞跃地发展起来的，去年全州工业产量为1913年的七十倍。在管理重心从中央移到地方以前，州内的一千多个工业企业由六十三个全苏和共和国的工业部、局领导。这样，使生产的进一步发展，特别是专业化和协作，受到了阻碍。只有经济区的成立，工业企业归国民经济委员会统一管理，才从根本上消除了这种障碍。
    改组以后
    苏联各个经济区国民经济委员会的机构是灵活的，它们因各区工业水平不同而有繁有简。斯维德洛夫斯克经济区的工业很集中，它的国民经济委员会的机构也比较大。它包括如下专业管理局：钢铁、有色金属、机器制造、电气设备、化学工业、建筑材料、建筑、燃料、木材、木材加工和造纸、轻工业、食品工业等。此外还有计划经济、技术、生产和协作、劳动和工资等等十五个科、处。
    当我访问这个国民经济委员会时，那里的干部已经安排就绪，虽然编制还没有满额。干部从三个方面来：一小部分来自已经撤销的中央各工业部，大部分来自当地的企业和机关。国民经济委员会主席斯捷潘诺夫是前苏联运输机器制造部部长，第一副主席索科洛夫是前苏联钢铁工业部副部长，不少的局长是前全苏或共和国工业部的副部长。钢铁工业管理局的编制一百十五人，已经选派了一百零五人，其中很多是前乌拉尔钢铁总局和前乌拉尔铁矿托辣斯的干部。
    新机构的特点在于：层次少，接近生产。斯捷潘诺夫告诉我：“机构才建立。人员彼此还陌生，对企业的情况也不很熟悉。但是，工厂就在跟前，随时可以下去，这是从前管理机构在莫斯科时做不到的”。事实确是这样。就以这个州的钢铁工厂和铁矿为例吧。从前这些企业分属于十二个总局、托辣斯和处，它们大多数远在莫斯科。其中乌拉尔钢铁总局虽然设在斯维德洛夫斯克，但是它要领导分布在整个乌拉尔地区的许多企业。这种情况自然不允许及时地效率很高地解决问题。而现在，全州的钢铁厂、耐火砖厂、焦炭化学厂、钢管厂、钢铁成品厂和铁矿，都统一由国民经济委员会的钢铁工业管理局领导，这个主管机关和生产企业近在咫尺。
    合并和精简
    斯维德洛夫斯克经济区的国民经济委员会才成立一个月。它的办公大楼还在修缮，人员还没有配全，但是它的工作已经积极开展起来。它不但接管了众多企业，而且领导某些管理机关和企业进行了合理的合并和精简。在以前管理机关和企业属于多头的部门的时候，这种合并和精简是不可想像的。
    根据人们在全民讨论工业管理制度的改组方针时提出的建议，国民经济委员会把水泥厂和石板厂合并了。这大大精简了行政工作人员，提高了设备的利用率，保证了生产的合拍和计划的顺利完成。在钢铁工业中，把铁矿和钢铁厂也合并了，这件事的意义很大。铁矿和钢铁厂的领导统一起来，就会消除生产脱节的现象。若干有色金属厂矿也将进行类似的合并。建筑机构也在进行广泛的合并和精简。州内两个平行的建筑托辣斯合并成为一个。在斯维德洛夫斯克市建立了统一的建筑机构，因此撤销了十五个建筑和安装单位。由于合并和精简，这个经济区从建筑机构中将腾出三百七十个行政工作人员，一年节约三百五十万卢布。
    这个州的工业企业多，有一百零七个国营农场专门供给它们牛奶、蔬菜等农畜产品。国营农场托辣斯过去有办事处、供应局十七个机构，包括三百四十二个人员管理这些企业。目前国民经济委员会决定组织统一的工人供应托辣斯，将精简二百个人员，使他们参加到生产中去。
    加强和群众的联系
    从斯维德洛夫斯克国民经济委员会的第一个月的活动中，明显地看到了加强工业管理机构和劳动者群众联系的新气象。
    国民经济委员会附设的群众性谘询机构——技术经济委员会已经成立了。它将一两个月举行一次会议，讨论些普遍性问题，如工厂用水的排泄和保持城市河水的清洁问题；讨论专业部门的专业化和协作的问题。它将广泛地倾听群众的意见，作出建议，提交给国民经济委员会。这里的技术经济委员会已经选定九十八个委员。他们代表社会各个方面。其中有经济区许多工厂著名的生产革新者、设计师、技师、经济工作者、厂长和总工程师；有国民经济委员会的各级领导工作人员；有本州党、工会、苏维埃和科学界的代表。
    国民经济委员会也通过各个工业企业的经济工作人员积极分子会议来听取群众的意见。当我在斯维德洛夫斯克时，这个经济区的钢铁工业、机器制造业相继举行了这种积极分子会议。参加这种会议的有先进工人、工程师、厂长、工厂党和工会工作者。国民经济委员会主席和局长也下厂参加。
    由于新机构接近生产，上下彼此的联系比从前密切了。例如，7月间，机器制造业的绝大多数厂长来过国民经济委员会的机器制造业管理局，这个局的工作人员也时常下厂。同业的工厂从前因为属于不同的工业部，不相往来；现在同业的厂长们组织联合的检查，互相学习长处，协同发现缺点。
    制定1958年计划
    苏联工业管理制度经过两个月的大改革，管理机构和人员变动极大，但是1957年上半年计划照旧完成了。斯维德洛夫斯克州的情形也是如此。这说明苏联工业企业的健全和社会主义制度的优越。现在，斯维德洛夫斯克经济区，正如其他经济区一样，开始制定1958年生产计划。
    往年，生产计划是由上级计划机关制定和规定的；现在，生产计划直接在企业里制定。在制定1958年生产计划时，仔细地考虑企业的条件和可能，以及劳动者在全民讨论工业管理方针时所提的意见。国民经济委员会工作人员下厂协助企业制定计划。在执行今年的计划中，斯维德洛夫斯克经济区和其他各区仍保持原有的生产和供应关系。因为不慎重地改变生产计划，会招致紊乱和损失。在1958年计划中将考虑怎样更合理地生产和供应，考虑同其他经济区的协作问题。总之，各经济区将积极地发挥地方的潜力。
    斯捷潘诺夫谦虚地说：国民经济委员会走了自己的第一步。目前工作还谈不上有什么成绩。所做的是新事。这里工业企业又多。当前的困难也不少。但是一些厂矿的合并，一定会发生巨大的效果，因为这不但精简了人员而且使生产合拍。下一步我们将研究生产的专业化和协作。
