See Who Sells More Surplus Grain

August 11th was market day in Chengguan Town, Rongchang County, Sichuan Province. On this day, the Rongchang Chengguan grain purchasing station was particularly lively. From morning to evening, members of agricultural cooperatives from various townships brought their dried and winnowed grain here to sell to the state. In one day, the Chengguan station purchased 600,000 jin of grain.

    8月11日是四川省荣昌县城关镇的市集日。这天，荣昌城关粮食收购站显得格外热闹。从早晨到傍晚，来自各乡的农业社社员们，都纷纷把晒干扬净的粮食挑到这里来卖给国家。一天内城关站就收购了粮食六十万斤。
