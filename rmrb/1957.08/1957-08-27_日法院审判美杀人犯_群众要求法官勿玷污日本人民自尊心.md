Xinhua News Agency, August 26th, Tokyo Dispatch: The case of American soldier Girard, who shot and killed Japanese woman Sakai Naka, which the Japanese people are concerned about, began trial today at the Maebashi District Court.

The court session began at 10:00 AM. The prosecutor read the indictment, accusing Girard of committing the crime of injury resulting in death. The indictment listed the following facts of the defendant's crime: On January 30th of this year, at the Soumagahara training ground, Girard threw bullet casings on the ground towards Sakai Naka and others who were nearby, and lured them by saying, "Old ladies, it's okay," etc., to pick up the bullet casings. He also pointed to a nearby trench and said to Sakai, "Old lady, there are plenty more." When Sakai walked towards the trench on the right, Girard suddenly shot her from behind at close range, hitting Sakai and causing her immediate death.

Girard pleaded not guilty to the murder in court. He denied that he had scattered bullet casings to lure people, saying that he had no intention of hurting anyone and that he only fired to "intimidate" people.

Hayashi Itsuo, the Japanese lawyer hired by the American authorities for Girard, insisted that the Japanese court had no right to try the case.

Prosecutor Sugimoto Kakuichi refuted Hayashi Itsuo's nonsense. Sugimoto pointed out that the defendant's actions could not be said to have occurred while performing official duties, so the jurisdiction clearly lies with the Japanese side. He confirmed that Girard committed the crime of injury resulting in death.

Today's trial ended at 4:31 PM. The next court session is on September 6th. The court hopes that the trial work can be completed by the end of October.

Today, thousands of people gathered around the courthouse, concerned about the trial of the American murderer. Some people held placards with slogans such as: "Japan should imprison Girard," "Judge! Do not tarnish the self-respect of the Japanese people."

　　日法院审判美杀人犯
　　群众要求法官勿玷污日本人民自尊心
    新华社26日讯　东京消息：日本人民关切的美国兵哲腊德枪杀日本妇女坂井中的案件今天在前桥地方裁判所开始审讯。
    上午十时开庭后，检察官宣读起诉书，控告哲腊德犯了伤害致死罪。起诉书列举被告的犯罪事实如下：今年1月30日，哲腊德在相马原演习场向着当时在当地附近的坂井中等人，把子弹壳扔到地上，招呼她们说：“老大娘，不要紧”等语，诱骗她们前来拾取子弹壳，他并且指着附近的壕沟对坂井说：“老大娘，多得很。”当坂井走向右边壕沟的时候，哲腊德忽然从她背后在很近的距离开枪，击中坂井，使她立即死亡。
    哲腊德当庭抵赖他的杀人罪行。他否认他曾经散布子弹壳引诱人，他说，他无意伤害人，他开枪只是为了“恐吓”人。
    美国当局为哲腊德物色的日本籍辩护律师林逸郎在辩护时一口咬定日本法院没有审判此案的权利。
    检察官杉本觉一驳斥了林逸郎的胡说。杉本指出，被告的行为不能说是在执行公务时发生的，所以，审判权显然在日本方面。他确认哲腊德犯了伤人致死罪。
    今天的审讯到下午四时三十一分结束。下次开庭日期是9月6日。裁判所方面希望审判工作能够在10月底结束。
    今天，有成千的人聚集在裁判所周围，关怀着对美国杀人犯的审讯情况。有人拿着标语牌，上面写着：“由日本方面监禁哲腊德”，“法官！不要玷污日本人民的自尊心”。
