Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 27th - Farmers in the southern Shanxi Plain have been going to the fields to pick new cotton since mid-August.

According to farmers in the southern and central Shanxi regions, although the province's more than five million mu of cotton suffered from drought this year, it can still produce more than last year. It is estimated that each mu can produce more than 35 jin of ginned cotton, an increase of about 6% over last year. Among them, the cotton in 700,000 mu of large-scale demonstration cotton fields is growing particularly well. The unit area yield of large-scale increased production cotton fields in Quwo, Fenyang and other counties can be 50% higher than that of ordinary cotton fields. The more than 10,000 mu of cotton in the Guoguang Agricultural Cooperative in Xieyu County, led by cotton planting model worker Qu Yaoli, can produce more than 60 jin of ginned cotton per mu, and the 700 mu of high-yield cotton fields can produce more than 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu.
