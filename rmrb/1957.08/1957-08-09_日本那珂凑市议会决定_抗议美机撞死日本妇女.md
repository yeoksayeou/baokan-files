Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 8th: The Nakaminato City Council in Tokyo's northeast passed a resolution on August 7th to protest to the American Air Force authorities regarding an incident in which an American military aircraft, flying at low altitude, killed a Japanese woman and injured her son.

On August 2nd, an aircraft piloted by U.S. Air Force pilot John Gordon took off from the Mito firing range near Nakaminato and suddenly flew at low altitude, resulting in the death of a woman, Haru Hojo, who was riding a bicycle, and seriously injuring her son, Seiichi. Afterwards, the American Air Force authorities denied responsibility, claiming that the aircraft suddenly flew low "due to abnormal heat causing air turbulence," attempting to evade responsibility.

The Nakaminato City Council, after questioning eyewitnesses to the incident and experienced pilots, and investigating the weather records of the Nakaminato Meteorological Observatory, issued an investigation report stating that the local climate was normal at the time of the incident; and that the plane was able to immediately ascend rapidly after the incident. Therefore, the American Air Force authorities' claim that the plane was forced to fly low due to climatic conditions is completely untenable.

    日本那珂凑市议会决定
    抗议美机撞死日本妇女
    据新华社8日讯东京消息：东京东北那珂凑市的议会8月7日通过决议，准备就一架美国军用飞机低飞撞死一位日本妇女和撞伤她的儿子的事件，向美国空军当局提出抗议。
    8月2日，一架由美国空军驾驶员约翰·戈登驾驶的飞机在那珂凑附近水户射击场起飞以后，突然作低空飞行，结果把一位骑在自行车上的妇女北条春撞死，并且使她的儿子清一受到重伤。事后，美国空军当局抵赖说，这架飞机是“由于不正常的热度引起空气变动”而突然低飞的，企图推卸责任。
    那珂凑市议会在询问了事件的目击者和有经验的飞行员，并且调查了那珂凑气象台的气象纪录以后，发表调查报告指出，事件发生时当地气候正常；并且在肇事以后能够立即向上急升。因此，美国空军当局的所谓飞机由于气候条件而被迫低飞的说法是完全站不住脚的。
