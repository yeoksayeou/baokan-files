　　During the day, the two siblings are in the fields.
　　The older brother teaches his younger sister how to hoe the ground.
　　The younger sister imitates her older brother.
　　In the evening, the two siblings are in the night school.
　　The younger sister teaches her older brother how to read.
　　The older brother learns to speak in his younger sister's tone.
　　Back home, the two siblings light the oil lamp.
　　After finishing their homework, they discuss farm work,
　　Until their old mother shows a bit of life.
