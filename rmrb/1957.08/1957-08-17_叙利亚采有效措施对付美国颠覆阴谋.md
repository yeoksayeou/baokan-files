Xinhua News Agency, August 15th, Cairo Dispatch: According to Cairo Radio, after discovering the American conspiracy to subvert the Syrian government, the Syrian cabinet has taken a series of measures to maintain law and order.

The radio said that these measures were decided upon at the cabinet meeting on the evening of the 13th.

Cairo Radio also quoted a Syrian government spokesperson in Damascus as saying that the Syrian authorities have decided to "severely punish those conspirators in order to warn all those who may think they can betray their country with impunity."

Xinhua News Agency, August 15th: The U.S. State Department announced on the 14th that the Syrian Ambassador to the U.S., Zeineddine, and the Second Secretary of the Syrian Embassy, Jakaalia, were "persona non grata." This is a retaliatory action taken by the U.S. government in a fit of pique after Syria uncovered an American spy organization's conspiracy to overthrow the current Syrian government.

    叙利亚采有效措施对付美国颠覆阴谋
    新华社15日讯  开罗消息：据开罗电台广播，叙利亚内阁在发现了美国颠覆叙利亚政府的阴谋以后，已经采取了一系列维护法律和秩序的措施。
    电台说，这些措施是在13日晚上的内阁会议上决定采取的。
    开罗电台还援引大马士革的一位叙利亚政府发言人的话说，叙利亚当局决定“严惩那些阴谋分子以便警戒所有那些也许以为他们可以背叛祖国而不受惩罚的人”。
    据新华社15日讯  美国国务院14日宣布叙利亚驻美大使宰尼丁和叙利亚大使馆二等秘书贾卡利亚为“不受欢迎”的人。这是美国政府在叙利亚破获美国间谍组织企图推翻叙利亚现政府的阴谋案以后老羞成怒而采取的报复行动。
