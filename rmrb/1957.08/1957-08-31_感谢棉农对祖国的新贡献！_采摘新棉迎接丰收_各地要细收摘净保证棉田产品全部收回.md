Xinhua News Agency, 30th – Thank you to the cotton farmers for their new contributions to the Motherland! Harvest new cotton to welcome the bumper harvest. All regions must carefully harvest and clean to ensure all cotton field products are recovered.

Most cotton-growing areas across the country have started harvesting new cotton.

According to a reporter from the Ministry of Agriculture, most of this year's cotton is growing well. The time is now approaching for cotton to successively burst into floss. If there are no floods or early frosts, this year's total cotton output may exceed last year's. If the harvest is good, it may be similar to the bumper harvest of 1955. (Note: The total cotton output in 1955 was 30.36 million dan, and in 1956 it was 28.9 million dan.)

Currently, in the cotton-growing areas south of the Yangtze River, such as Hunan, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang provinces, new cotton has already entered the market, and some agricultural cooperatives are preparing to sell new cotton to the state. Cotton-growing areas in Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, Shaanxi, Sichuan, and Hubei provinces have all started harvesting new cotton. New cotton has also entered the market in areas such as Luoyang and Nanyang in Henan Province. Early-maturing cotton in Hebei and southern Shanxi has also been harvested.

Last year, the main cotton-producing provinces of Hebei, Henan, Jiangsu, and Anhui suffered heavily from typhoons and rainstorms, resulting in reduced cotton production. This year, only a small number of cotton fields in Henan and Shandong provinces have been affected by disasters. The more than 49 million mu of cotton fields in Hebei, Henan, Shandong, and Jiangsu provinces, which account for more than half of the country's area and output, are full of cotton bolls, presenting a scene of bumper harvest. According to a report by the cotton production survey team organized by the State Council, the preliminary estimate of the output of more than 10 million mu of cotton in Henan Province may increase by more than 300,000 dan compared to last year. The average yield per mu of the more than 14 million mu of cotton in Hebei Province is estimated to be close to 41 jin, which is one jin higher than the average yield per mu in the bumper harvest of 1955. This year's cotton in Jiangsu Province is also of medium to high quality, with a preliminary estimate that it may increase by more than 900,000 dan compared to last year. In addition, Shandong Province will also have a bumper cotton harvest. According to the province's Department of Agriculture, the unit area yield of the province's more than 11 million mu of cotton may also reach over 40 jin.

The cotton production situation in Hubei, Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Zhejiang provinces is also good this year. It is understood that the more than 8.7 million mu of cotton in Hubei Province may increase by 8% compared to last year. The total cotton output in Sichuan Province may also increase by more than 10% compared to last year. The 1.15 million mu of cotton in Zhejiang Province has tall plants, lush leaves, and many large bolls. The Provincial Department of Agriculture estimates that each mu can produce about 60 jin; in Cixi County, a famous high-yield cotton area, the 540,000 mu of cotton fields are estimated to yield about 90 jin per mu, exceeding the highest unit yield in history in 1955. The cotton bolls in the more than 4.7 million mu of irrigated and dry land cotton in Shaanxi Province generally have 6 to 12 bolls, and the yield per mu is estimated to reach 30 to 70 jin. The province will increase cotton production by about 100,000 dan compared to last year. Anhui and Jiangxi provinces are also expected to have bumper cotton harvests.

This year, the actual harvested area of cotton fields nationwide will be more than 1 million mu less than last year, but the total output may increase compared to last year. The main reasons are that the area of improved cotton varieties has greatly expanded compared to last year, the close planting of cotton has been improved compared to last year, sowing was timely, field management was more meticulous than last year, pest and disease control was better than last year, and the quantity and quality of fertilizer applied to cotton fields in many areas also improved compared to last year.

To ensure increased cotton production, the Ministry of Agriculture believes that attention must also be paid to the cotton harvesting work. First of all, it is necessary to ensure that all cotton field products are fully and safely recovered, truly achieving timely, careful harvesting, and avoiding losses such as cotton dropping or scattering. All regions must also pay attention to harvesting the remaining cotton flowers on the cotton stalks at the end of the cotton harvesting period. Although the quantity is not large, accumulating small amounts makes a big difference, which is still a large income for agricultural cooperatives and the state. Secondly, in the cotton harvesting work, it is also necessary to ensure the quality of the cotton and conscientiously implement the "five separations" method of separating, drying, storing, ginning, and selling good and bad cotton. This is to meet the requirements of the textile industry.

### 感谢棉农对祖国的新贡献！　采摘新棉迎接丰收  各地要细收摘净保证棉田产品全部收回

　　感谢棉农对祖国的新贡献！
　　采摘新棉迎接丰收
    各地要细收摘净保证棉田产品全部收回
    新华社30日讯　全国大部分棉区开始采摘新棉了。
    据记者从农业部获悉：今年的棉花大部分生长得好，今后是棉花陆续吐絮的时候，如果没有雨涝，不遇早霜，今年的棉花总产量可能超过去年，如果收得好还可能和大丰收的1955年差不多。（按：1955年棉花总产量是三千零三十六万担，1956年是二千八百九十万担）
    现在，长江以南湖南、江西、浙江等省棉区新棉已将上市，有的农业社已准备向国家交售新棉。河南、山东、江苏、陕西、四川和湖北等省的棉区都已经开始了采摘新棉。河南省洛阳、南阳等地也有新棉上市。河北、山西南部地区的早熟棉花也已经采摘了。
    去年，主要产棉的河北、河南、江苏、安徽等省因台风、暴雨受灾很重，因而棉花减产。今年却只有河南、山东两省有少数棉田受灾。而现在面积和产量都超过全国一半以上的河北、河南、山东和江苏四省的四千九百多万亩棉花，都结桃累累，呈现出一片丰收景象。据国务院组织的棉花生产调查组的报告，河南省的一千多万亩棉花的产量初步预计可能比去年增产三十多万担。河北省的一千四百多万亩棉花的平均亩产量估计可能接近四十一斤，这就比大丰收的1955年的平均亩产量还高一斤。江苏省今年的棉花也是中上年成，初步估计可能比去年增产九十多万担左右。另外，山东省的棉花也将得到丰收。据这个省的农业厅估计，全省一千一百多万亩棉花的单位面积产量也可能达到四十斤以上。
    湖北、四川、陕西和浙江等省今年棉花的生产情况也是好的。据了解，湖北省八百七十多万亩棉花可能比去年增产8％。四川省全省的棉花总产量也可能比去年增加一成以上。浙江省的一百十五万亩棉花，株高叶盛，桃多而大，省农业厅估计每亩可产六十斤左右；著名的高产棉区慈溪县的五十四万亩棉田，估计每亩可收九十斤左右，超过历史上单位产量最高的1955年。陕西省的四百七十多万亩水浇地和旱地棉花的棉桃一般都有六到十二个，亩产量估计可达到三十斤到七十斤，全省将比去年增产棉花十万担左右。安徽和江西等省的棉花也丰收在望。
    今年全国棉田的实际收获面积要比去年少一百多万亩，而总产量却可能比去年增加，其中主要原因是棉花的良种面积比去年又有极大发展，棉花的密植工作比去年又有了改进，加以播种适时，田间管理工作比去年做得精细，同时病虫害的防治工作也比去年做得好，棉田的施肥数量和质量在许多地区也比去年有提高。
    要保证棉花得到增产，农业部认为还必须注意作好棉花的收获工作。这首先是要保证棉田的产品要全部地、安全地收回来，真正做到及时细收摘净、避免棉瓤掉落、抛散等损失。对收花末期棉秆上残留的尾花，各地也必须注意收摘，这虽然数量不大，但集少成多，对农业社和国家来说仍然是一笔很大的收入。其次，在棉花收摘工作中还必须保证棉花的质量，切实贯彻好坏花分收、分晒、分存、分轧、分卖的“五分”办法。以便适合于纺织工业的要求。
