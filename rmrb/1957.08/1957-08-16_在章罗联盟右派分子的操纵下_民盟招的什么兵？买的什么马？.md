Xinhua News Agency, 15th -- According to revealed materials, the China Democratic League's organization, due to the manipulation of bourgeois rightists, once teetered on the edge of danger. According to preliminary investigations by reporters, the number of rightists exposed in the Democratic League is the highest, accounting for more than 39% of the total number of rightists exposed in all democratic parties. There are rightists in the Central Committee of the Democratic League, in provincial and municipal organizations, and in a considerable number of grassroots organizations.

Those Who Approve of the Party Are Hated; Those Who Disapprove Are Favored

The emergence of this situation is inseparable from the "vigorous development" policy implemented by the Zhang Bojun-Luo Longji group in order to expand its power, contend with the Communist Party, and divide the country. The right-wing backbone elements in the Democratic League in various regions resolutely implemented this policy of the Zhang-Luo group and unscrupulously absorbed a large number of unqualified people and many bad elements into the League. At the beginning of last year, the Shanghai Democratic League organization had 967 members. In the year and a half since then, especially since July of last year when the "vigorous development" instructions of the Zhang-Luo group began to be implemented, the number of members has increased sharply to 3,384. Among the 146 people directly introduced into the League by right-wing backbone elements Chen Renbing, Peng Wenying, Han Ming, Zhao Wenbi, and Sun Siming, more than half were backward elements. The "achievements" of the Shanghai Democratic League right-wing group's "vigorous development" were praised by Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji at the National Work Conference of the Democratic League this spring.

The organizational line implemented by the right-wing elements in the Democratic League in various regions can be seen generally. Pan Dakui, a right-wing element of the Democratic League in Sichuan Province, proposed that "as long as they are not current counter-revolutionary elements, they can be developed into the League." Under Pan's instructions, some people who were dissatisfied with the Communist Party, had political and historical problems, and harbored various political ambitions sneaked into the Democratic League. The Democratic League organizations in Hubei Province implemented an anti-Communist organizational line of "the more the better, the worse the better." They emphasized that regardless of historical and political conditions, they would "accept anyone who asks to join the League." The right-wing element Ma Zhemin openly instructed the Democratic League cadres to "hate what the Party likes and like what the Party hates" when developing League members. The Shanghai Democratic League's right-wing group adopted the policy of "taking backward elements as the backbone, striving for the middle, and isolating and excluding progressives" in developing League members. Shen Zhiyuan, chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Democratic League, also promoted various fallacies such as "political progress, middle, and backward are difficult to distinguish clearly" and "class relations have changed, and political history need not be overemphasized," providing "theoretical basis" for "opening the door to the backward." Zhong Ping, the right-wing element of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Democratic League, secretary-general, and head of the organization department, in order to develop limitlessly "the more the better," even though some units had already developed a lot, he still asked cadres to examine and criticize "saturation thinking" and demanded continued development.

Entertaining Guests, Promising Official Positions, and Indulging in Empty Promises; Forcibly Pulling, Dragging, Swindling and Deceiving

Under the guidance of this reactionary organizational line, many places adopted various despicable means such as entertaining guests, serving tea and snacks, paying door-to-door visits, promising official positions, forcibly pulling and dragging, and swindling and deceiving to recruit soldiers and buy horses and expand their power. The Jinan Democratic League organization simplified development procedures, sent people to distribute registration forms everywhere, and canceled the procedures for writing autobiographies and approval by the League Municipal Committee. Chai Shouan, director of the office of the Fuxin Municipal Preparatory Committee of the Democratic League and a right-wing element, adopted various deceptive and enticing means to carry out "vigorous development." She flattered some "representative" engineering technicians, saying, "Fill out the form quickly! It has been decided that you will be the director of the committee." She said to those who wanted to join the Communist Party, "The Party has stopped developing now, and joining the League is the same." "If you join the Party, you are just an ordinary Party member. If you join the League, you can also develop League members and become a leader." She said to those who wanted to improve their professional knowledge, "Joining the League can solve the problem of marching towards science. The League will lead the march towards science." In addition, Chai Shouan also adopted the method of "going through internal channels" and using family relationships to attract people to join the League; sometimes, she even openly deceived by saying that someone had already applied to join the League, so you should hurry up.

In the "vigorous development" of the Guangzhou Municipal Democratic League organization, it was even explicitly stated that the introducer would not be held politically responsible, would not write an autobiography, and would not undergo group discussion; they generally only registered for membership by holding seminars, inviting people to dinner, and "talking heart-to-heart" in teahouses. In Henan Province, new League members were approved by the group themselves. Wang Yizhai, director of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Democratic League and a right-wing element, specifically named people who were subject to suppression and those who hated the Communist Party to be developed into League members. He personally revised the autobiographies of those whom the grassroots organizations of the Democratic League disagreed with, deleted and changed their political history, and then absorbed them into the League. Chen Renbing, a right-wing element in Shanghai, proposed that "it is better to strike first" and repeatedly instructed to lower the standards for joining the League in order to compete with other parties. In Chongqing, there was also a group of "special League members" "appointed" by the Zhang-Luo group who joined the League without going through legal procedures. Liu Shengya, a right-wing element in Chongqing's literary and art circles, was such a person. He boasted that he was a special League member "developed by someone sent by the Central Committee of the Democratic League." During this period of great blooming and contending, Liu Shengya became the main general of the Democratic League's right-wing group in Chongqing's literary and art circles. Li Changfu, a right-wing element of the Tianjin Railway Engineering School, under the instruction of Wang Dachuan, a right-wing backbone element in the Tianjin Democratic League, adopted the method of "single-line membership" and specialized in finding people who had suffered "injustices" in the new society. Li Changfu maliciously incited an engineer who was under investigation in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, saying, "Intellectuals like us are like children without mothers. Whenever there is a movement, it will fall on us. If you join the League, someone will speak for you, and they won't dare to give you small shoes anymore." When this engineer was still unwilling to join the League, Li Changfu even used the method of introducing him to a girlfriend to pull him into the League.

Landlords and Despots Are Accepted Regardless; Traitors and Collaborators Are Recruited as Backbone

During the period of "Great Blooming and Great Contending," the rightists became even more arrogant. Wuhan, Shanghai, and other places put forward the slogan of "joining the League on the front line." They immediately absorbed into the League those who dared to attack the Communist Party. The Anshan Municipal Organization of the Democratic League originally had 18 members. After the nationwide anti-rightist struggle began, Zhang Yuyuan, the person in charge of the Anshan Municipal Organization of the Democratic League, still attempted to hold a forum of more than 100 people to develop League members in batches in order to immediately establish the Anshan Municipal Preparatory Committee of the Democratic League. Until mid-June, they were still approving the absorption of League members and expanding the organization. Zhang Yuyuan also took 2,000 people as the development plan, implemented the method of "accepting anyone who comes," and planned to turn Anshan into the largest stronghold of the Democratic League after Shenyang. In Maoming County, Guangdong Province, during the period of "Great Blooming and Great Contending," eight or nine so-called activists who launched fierce attacks on the Communist Party were immediately absorbed into the League on the "front line."

The Democratic League organizations in some places developed in all directions and expanded their power everywhere. The Henan Provincial Democratic League organization once instructed its subordinates: "Regardless of upper, middle, and lower levels, regardless of large, medium, and small schools, regardless of advanced, middle, and backward, all can be developed." The Luoyang Democratic League organization wanted to "take over all factories and schools in the city." The Jinan Democratic League organization proposed to eliminate blank spots in secondary schools. Zhong Ping, a right-wing element of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Democratic League, personally went to Zhanjiang, Hainan Island, and other places to convey and deploy the work of developing the organization. Among the seven newly developed League members in Haikang County, Guangdong Province, two were landlords.

The implementation of this "vigorous development" "policy" of the Zhang-Luo group has caused great harm to both the socialist cause and the Democratic League organization itself. Among those who joined the League in the vigorous development, some were people who supported the Communist Party and the socialist cause; some were mediocre people who were taken by the rightists to increase their political capital; and there was also a considerable number of people who were dissatisfied with the Communist Party and the socialist cause, some of whom had unclear political backgrounds, some of whom were criminal offenders, and some of whom were landlords and counter-revolutionaries. The Shanghai literary and art circles' Democratic League organization, directly responsible by Chen Renbing, had extremely complex components. The right-wing elements found in the literary and art circles this time, with the exception of a few individuals, were almost all members of the Democratic League. Among the 30 people directly introduced into the League by Peng Wenying, five were right-wing elements, and another five were Kuomintang secret agents, traitors, brutal landlords with blood debts, and corrupt criminals. Under the control of the right-wing element Lu Junxiong, Chengdu Institute of Physical Education, 80% of the new League members absorbed in the past year were people who were dissatisfied with the Communist Party, had historical problems, and had organized anti-Communist cliques.

Upright League Members Express Great Indignation and Actively Expose Harmful Elements

Many so-called "newborn forces" newly developed into the League by the rightists spread various fallacies during the "Great Blooming and Great Contending," instigated and added fuel to the fire, and viciously attacked the Communist Party and socialism. Wang Jianguo and Yang Songtao, the leaders who created the counter-revolutionary riot in Hanyang County No. 1 Middle School in June this year, were the "activists" praised by Yang Huanrao, a confidant of the right-wing backbone element Ma Zhemin. After Li Changfu, a right-wing element of the Tianjin Railway Engineering School, wooed a group of people with complex backgrounds into the League, he often used these "new League members" to instigate and add fuel to the fire among students and teachers, spreading reactionary remarks. In May this year, Li Changfu, together with two other right-wing elements, jointly planned and put forward 32 anti-Soviet programs and nearly 40 anti-socialist remarks. He attempted to overthrow the Communist Party organization in this school so that the Democratic League organization could replace it. Zhong Yanda, a teacher at Leizhou Normal School in Guangdong Province, was originally a large landlord and had been a Kuomintang official. After joining the League, he openly wrote the reactionary slogan "Eliminate the Communist Party" on the blackboard in the classroom, inciting students to oppose the Communist Party. Fuxin City only had Chai Shouan as a League member in February and March this year. By the beginning of June, Chai Shouan had developed 37 people, quickly established a preparatory committee, and formed a right-wing group, secretly holding meetings to decide to "supervise" the Communist Party's rectification and "push the Party forward." They demanded to be "on an equal footing" with the Communist Party and "to put on a show for the Communist Party to see." They personally visited the families of those who were suppressed and added fuel to the fire everywhere, spreading fallacies and causing great harm to the work. Until the anti-rightist campaign began, this right-wing group was still forming an alliance of offense and defense within the League, expressing that "when necessary, sacrifice individuals to take care of the whole." Such an organization of the League has not had any positive effect from the first day it was established.

The current situation of the Democratic League organization under the control of the Zhang-Luo group has aroused dissatisfaction among the vast number of people in society and among upright League members. League members in various places, including those new League members who are willing to take the socialist road, have all condemned the reactionary behavior of the right-wing elements in the League. They do not allow the Zhang-Luo group and its followers to lead them astray.

### 在章罗联盟右派分子的操纵下  民盟招的什么兵？买的什么马？

    在章罗联盟右派分子的操纵下
    民盟招的什么兵？买的什么马？
    新华社15日讯  根据已揭露的材料证明，由于资产阶级右派分子的操纵，中国民主同盟的组织一度踏上了危险的边缘。根据记者的初步调查，目前民盟中已经揭露出来的右派分子数目最多，占各民主党派揭露出来的右派分子总数的39％以上。右派分子在民盟中央有，在省市组织中有，在盟的基层组织中也有相当一批。
    党好者恶之  党恶者好之
    这种情况的出现，是同章伯钧—罗隆基集团为了发展势力同共产党分庭抗礼，实行“大发展”的方针分不开的。各地民盟中的右派骨干分子坚决执行章罗集团这一方针，不择手段地吸收了大批不够条件的人以及很多坏分子入盟。上海民盟组织在去年年初有九百六十七个盟员，一年半以来，特别是从去年7月开始执行章罗集团的“大发展”指示到现在，盟员人数骤增到三千三百八十四人。在右派骨干分子陈仁炳、彭文应、韩鸣、赵文璧、孙斯鸣等直接介绍入盟的一百四十六人中，落后分子占一半以上。上海民盟右派集团“大发展”的“成绩”，曾在今春民盟全国工作会议上受到了章伯钧和罗隆基的表扬。
    从各地民盟中的右派分子所执行的组织路线可以见到一般。四川省民盟的右派分子潘大逵提出，“只要不是现行的反革命分子就可以发展入盟”。在潘的指示下，一些对共产党不满、政治上历史上有问题、怀有各种政治野心的分子都钻进了民盟。湖北省的民盟组织执行了越多越好、越坏越好的反共的组织路线，它们强调不管历史和政治条件，对要求入盟的人都“来而不拒”；右派分子马哲民更公开地指示民盟干部，在发展盟员时要“党所好者，恶之；党所恶者，好之。”上海民盟的右派集团发展盟员采取了“以落后为骨干，争取中间，孤立和排斥进步”的方针；民盟上海市委主任委员沈志远并宣传“政治上的进步、中间、落后是很难划分清楚的”、“阶级关系已经变化了，政治历史情况可以不必过分强调”等各种谬论，为“向落后开门”提供“理论根据”。民盟广东省委的右派分子、秘书长兼组织部长钟平，为了“越多越好”无限制地发展，有的单位虽然已经发展了很多，他还要干部检查批判“饱和思想”，要求继续发展。
    请客吃饭封官许愿  强拉硬拖招摇撞骗
    在这种反动的组织路线的指导下，许多地方采取了请客吃饭、茶点恭候、登门拜访、封官许愿、强拉硬拖、招摇撞骗等种种卑劣的手段，招兵买马，扩展势力。济南的民盟组织简化了发展手续，派人到处散发登记表，取消了写自传和盟市委批准的手续。民盟阜新市筹委会办公室主任、右派分子柴寿安采取了种种欺骗利诱手段来进行“大发展”，她对一些“有代表性的”工程技术人员就封官许爵的说：“快填表吧！已经决定你做主任委员了。”她对那些想加入共产党的人说：“现在党停止发展，入盟也是一样”、“你参加了党也不过是个普通党员，要是入了盟，还可以发展盟员，当领导”。她对那些要求提高业务知识的人说：“入盟可以解决向科学进军问题，盟要领导向科学进军。”另外，柴寿安还采取了“走内线”的方式，利用家庭关系来拉人入盟；有时并且公开欺骗说，某某已申请入盟了，你还不快点。
    广州市的民盟组织在“大发展”中，甚至明确提出介绍人不负政治责任，不写自传，不经小组讨论；他们一般只通过开座谈会、请吃饭和上茶楼“谈心”等方式，报名入盟。在河南省，新盟员入盟由小组自行核准。民盟河南省委主任委员、右派分子王毅斋指名把肃反对象和对共产党仇恨的分子发展为盟员，他并且为民盟基层组织不同意发展的人亲自修改自传，删改政治历史，然后吸收到盟里来。上海市的右派分子陈仁炳提出要“先下手为强”，一再指示要降低入盟标准，以便和其他党派展开竞争。在重庆，还有一批由章罗集团“钦定”的不通过合法手续入盟的“特殊盟员”。重庆文艺界右派分子刘盛亚就是这种人物，他夸耀自己“是民盟中央派人来发展的”特殊盟员。在这次大鸣大放中，刘盛亚成了民盟右派集团在重庆文艺界掌大旗的主将。天津铁路工程学校右派分子李长福在天津民盟中的右派骨干分子王大川指示下，采取了“单线入盟”的方式，专门物色那些在新社会受过“委曲”的人。李长福恶意地煽动一个肃反中被审查的工程师说：“我们这样的知识分子就像没娘的孩子一样，遇有运动就会临到我们头上。入了盟就有人替你说话，他们就不敢再给小鞋穿了。”当这个工程师还不愿意入盟时，李长福甚至用介绍女朋友的办法来拉他入盟。
    地主恶霸来者不拒  特务汉奸收为骨干
    在“大鸣大放”时期，右派分子更加嚣张。武汉、上海等地提出了“火线入盟”的口号。他们抓住那些敢于向共产党进攻的人物立即吸收到盟里来。民盟鞍山市组织原有十八个盟员，在全国反右派斗争展开以后，民盟鞍山市组织负责人张裕元还企图召开一百多人的座谈会，成批地发展盟员，以便立即成立民盟鞍山市筹备委员会。直到6月中旬，他们还批准吸收盟员，扩大组织，张裕元并且以两千人作为发展计划，实行“来者不拒”的办法，打算把鞍山变成仅次于沈阳民盟的最大据点。在广东省的茂名县，“大鸣大放”时期有八、九个对共产党进行猛烈攻击的所谓积极分子，都立即在“火线”上被吸收入盟了。
    有些地方的民盟组织“四面开花”地发展，到处扩展势力。河南省民盟组织曾经指示下级：“不分上中下层，不分大中小学，不分先进、中间、落后，都可发展。”洛阳的民盟组织要“将全市的工厂、学校都包下来”。济南的民盟组织提出要在中等学校消灭空白点。民盟广东省委的右派分子钟平曾亲自到湛江、海南岛等地传达和布置发展组织的工作。广东省的海康县新发展的七个盟员中，就有两个是地主分子。
    章罗集团这种“大发展”的“方针”实行的结果，不管对社会主义事业和对民盟组织本身，都造成了极大的危害。在大发展中入盟的人，有一批是拥护共产党、拥护社会主义事业的人；有一批是被右派分子拿来增加自己政治资本的滥竽充数的人；另有相当一批是对共产党对社会主义事业心怀不满的人，他们当中有的政治面目不清，有的是刑事犯罪分子，有的是地主和反革命分子。由陈仁炳直接负责的上海文艺界民盟组织，成分极为复杂，这次在文艺界查出的右派分子，除个别人以外，几乎全部是民盟盟员。由彭文应直接介绍入盟的三十个人中，有五个是右派分子，另有五个是军统特务、汉奸、有血债的恶霸地主和贪污刑事犯。成都体育学院在右派分子卢君雄的控制下，近一年来吸收的新盟员有80％是对共产党不满、历史上有问题和组织过反共小集团的人。
    正直盟员表示极大义愤  积极起来揭发害群之马
    许多被右派分子新发展入盟的所谓“新生力量”，他们在“大鸣大放”中散布各种谬论，煽动点火，恶毒地向共产党和社会主义进攻。今年6月在汉阳县第一中学制造反革命暴乱的首领王建国、杨松涛等人，就是右派骨干分子马哲民的亲信杨焕尧所称道的“积极分子”。天津铁路工程学校右派分子李长福拉拢了一批成分复杂的人入盟以后，便经常通过这些“新盟员”在学生和教师中煽动点火，散布反动言论。今年5月，李长福同其中两个右派分子共同策划，提出了三十二条反苏纲领和近四十条反社会主义的言论，他企图把这个学校中的共产党组织整垮，以使民盟组织取而代之。广东省雷州师范学校教师钟彦达，原是一个大地主，当过国民党官员，他在入盟以后，公开在教室的黑板上写“消灭共产党”的反动口号，煽动学生反对共产党。阜新市在今年2、3月间还只有柴寿安一个盟员，到6月初柴寿安发展到三十七人，迅速建立了筹委会，并且结成了一个右派集团，秘密召开会议，决定要“监督”共产党整风，“推着党走”。他们要求和共产党“平起平坐”，“要唱一出对台戏给共产党看看”，他们亲自访问肃反对象的家属，到处点火，散布谬论，给工作造成很大危害。直到反击右派开始，这个右派集团还在盟内订立攻守同盟，表示“必要时牺牲个人，照顾整体。”这样一个盟的组织，从它成立的第一天起，就没有发生一点积极作用。
    章罗集团操纵下的民盟组织今日之状况，引起广大社会人士的不满，引起正直的盟员的不满，各地民盟成员包括那些愿走社会主义道路的新盟员在内，都同声斥责盟内右派分子的反动行为，他们不允许章罗集团及其党羽把他们引入歧途。
