Extinguishing the Flames of Sin
    —The Pan Dakui Reactionary Group's Arson and Self-Immolation in Ya'an
    By our reporters Ding Fan and Li Ce

    The Sichuan stronghold of the Zhang-Luo alliance—the Pan Dakui reactionary group—used the Sichuan Agricultural College in Ya'an as a pilot project for "setting fires" in mid-June. In advance, Pan Dakui instructed Zhao Yiming, the "arsonist" of this reactionary group, to pay attention to drawing lessons from it so that it could be promoted. This carefully planned conspiracy has been thoroughly bankrupted by the resolute resistance of the people of Ya'an!

    Last September, when the Sichuan Agricultural College moved from Chengdu to Ya'an, some teachers and students were reluctant to leave city life and were dissatisfied with the relocation. On May 13, Zhao Yiming, on the orders of Pan Dakui, brought the reactionary political program of the Zhang-Luo alliance to Ya'an and secretly plotted with Yang Zhinong, the director of the Minmeng branch of the Agricultural College and a professor, to seize the relocation issue as a fuse for arson. They sang in chorus at several branch meetings of the Minmeng at the Agricultural College. Zhao Yiming said that the Minmeng is facing a new situation today, and it is necessary to re-evaluate the status of the Minmeng. In the future, the relationship with the Communist Party will not be one of superior and subordinate, but one of independence and equality, requiring everyone to abandon the leadership of the Party when considering issues. He proposed that the Minmeng should participate in design, construction, rehearsal, and directing in the school. He said that in the past, the Minmeng branch helped open up the minds of teachers and students and supported the decision to relocate the college, which was "helping the tyrant to do evil." He maliciously attacked the situation of "letting go and contending" in the Agricultural College at that time as "the leadership does not let go, and the masses are not at ease." He said: "You let go, it doesn't matter if you are wrong, we will be gunners." Before leaving Ya'an, Zhao Yiming gave Yang Zhinong face-to-face instructions to go to Chengdu to find Pan Dakui.

    The personal ambitionist Yang Zhinong usually spread rumors, saying that Dean Yang Kaiqu could not lead, and at this time he became even more arrogant, using the opposition to the relocation issue to win over the masses, establish personal prestige, and oppose the leadership of the Communist Party. He also colluded with the rightist element and professor Xia Dingyou, using the excuse of opposing the relocation to incite students to engage in great democracy and uncover the lid. Yang Zhinong openly demanded that the Communist Party Committee of the Agricultural College make a decision that "relocating the college was a mistake." At the forum held by the Minmeng branch, he secretly instigated people to speak out against the relocation. The United Front Work Department of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China invited faculty and staff of the Agricultural College to Chengdu to participate in a forum. Yang Zhinong took the opportunity to incite the faculty and staff attending the forum to insist on opposing the relocation, and organized people to speak, saying that building a college in Ya'an was "like transplanting a tree into the desert." He said: "If the school is not moved back to Chengdu, it may cause great democracy." Yang Zhinong even couldn't help but say that the "fire" in Ya'an had already been ignited.

    On June 15, after the radio and newspapers published Yang and Xia's speeches, rightist elements Li Depei and Yang Xuxian among the students, the Communist Youth League traitor Zhao Binchang, and others gathered some students and immediately posted a large number of reactionary big-character posters and slogans, established an "Action Committee," and actively prepared for strikes, petitions, and marches. Zhao Binchang also incited students to give up their membership in the Party and the League and participate in the trouble. Li Depei incited all students in the college to take active action and engage in great democracy on the radio. He proposed seven plans, including resolutely supporting Yang Zhinong and Xia Dingyou's speeches. Rightist elements controlled the student union and broadcasting equipment, illegally organized four guard groups, monitored teachers and students entering and leaving the school gate, monitored the actions of Hao Xiaotian, the deputy secretary of the Party committee, and even threatened to tie up the Party committee secretary. They decided to make trouble for the Ya'an Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, elect representatives to go to Chengdu to petition, and prepare to hold a meeting to welcome Yang Zhinong and Xia Dingyou. At this time, the whole school was filled with a miasma.

    On the morning of the 16th, they sent liaison groups to Ya'an Municipal Workers and Peasants' Accelerated Secondary School and other schools to incite students to strike and post reactionary slogans on the streets, issuing arrogant shouts such as "Oppose the highest authority—the State Council," "Down with Du Xinyuan, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Committee," "Down with Kang Nai'er, Director of the Provincial Higher Education Bureau," and "Support and support Yang and Xia's speeches." They also threatened the citizens, saying that whoever tore down these slogans would be arrested. On the same day, they sent representatives to Chengdu to petition, and more than seventy students went to the bus station to buy tickets. In order to take care of the needs of the majority of passengers, the ticket seller refused to sell them all the tickets at once. This group of students called in more than a hundred classmates and surrounded the station, threatening the ticket seller to sell them tickets. The station staff sternly refused their unreasonable demands. Student Liang Bokang and others took off their school badges and pretended to be tax bureau cadres, rushed into the station manager's office, and threatened the station manager to sell tickets. Nearby workers and citizens came to persuade the students not to make trouble unreasonably. Student Tian Shulun even insulted the masses, causing great indignation among the masses. An old woman pointed to her clothes and used the changes in her life to scold these students to their faces. Under the stern condemnation of the masses, these students saw that the situation was not good and fled back to school. The reactionary slogans they posted were torn to pieces by the citizens.

    After this group of troublemaking students was justly condemned by the masses, they did not know how to repent. Under the manipulation of rightist elements, they immediately incited hundreds of students to detain two cadres of the rectification work team of the prefectural committee stationed in the school, saying that they were "suspicious people," "plainclothes policemen of the Communist Party," and "spies." They wanted to beat them up. Then, they pushed them back and forth and took them to the student union and the club respectively, illegally organized a court, and interrogated them continuously for four or five hours. Finally, they forced them to sign the "confession" drafted by the rightist elements, admitting that they had incited the masses at the station and prevented the student petition representatives from buying tickets and other trumped-up "crimes."

    On the 17th, the reactionary arrogance of the rightist elements became even more rampant. A large number of reactionary big-character posters were posted, and the local Party, government, and masses were insulted on the radio. Nearby workers and citizens could not bear it any longer. Five or six hundred people spontaneously poured into the school to protest the reactionary behavior of the rightist elements and tore down the reactionary big-character posters and slogans in the school. The masses accused the troublemaking students, saying: "You live in the most beautiful houses in Ya'an and eat the rice of the people. Do you have a conscience?" They demanded that Yang Zhinong come out and answer. Many people sang the song "Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China." At that time, the rightist students slandered the masses as "disguised residents" and "hooligans," and mingled in the crowd and beat three comrades, including the secretary of the municipal party committee and the president of the municipal people's court, who came to maintain order.

    On the 18th, the people of Ya'an City couldn't bear the anger any longer and posted many slogans and big-character posters in the school to advise the college students to stand on the people's side and demand that the troublemaking students admit their mistakes. After the symposium, the student representatives accepted the opinions of the masses and began to admit their mistakes. On the same day, the Ya'an Municipal Political Consultative Conference held an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee. The heads of various democratic parties, provincial and municipal people's representatives, and worker and peasant representatives attending the meeting unanimously refuted Yang Zhinong and Xia Dingyou's reactionary remarks, and once again warned the students of the Agricultural College not to be fooled by the rightist elements any longer.

    Since then, all the teachers and students of the school have clarified their direction and launched a struggle against Yang, Xia, and the rightist elements among the students, extinguishing this flame of sin.

　　扑灭了罪恶的火焰
    ——潘大逵反动集团在雅安放火自焚的经过
    本报记者　丁帆　李策
    章罗联盟在四川的据点——潘大逵反动集团，6月中旬，以设在雅安的四川农学院作为“放火”的试点。事前，潘大逵指示这个反动集团的“纵火犯”赵一明，要注意从中吸取经验，以便推广。这个周密布置的阴谋，在雅安市人民坚决反击下，已经彻底破产了！
    去年9月，四川农学院从成都迁到雅安，部分师生留恋城市生活，不满意迁院。5月13日，赵一明奉了潘大逵之命，带上章罗联盟的反动政治纲领，来到雅安，和民盟农学院支部主任委员、教授杨志农密谋，抓住迁院问题作为放火的导火线。他们在民盟农学院数次支部会上一唱一合。赵一明说，今天民盟处在新形势面前，要重新估计民盟的地位，今后同共产党不是上级和下级，是独立平等，要求大家考虑问题时抛开党的领导。他提出民盟在学校里要参加设计、施工、排练、导演。他说过去民盟支部帮助打通师生思想，支持迁院决定，是“助纣为虐”。他恶意攻击当时农学院放、鸣情况是“领导不放手，群众不放心”。他说：“你们放，错了也没关系，我们要当炮手。”赵一明临离开雅安之前，又面授机宜叫杨志农去成都找潘大逵。
    个人野心家杨志农平时就散布流言蜚语，说杨开渠院长领导不起来，这时更加嚣张，借反对迁院问题，拢络群众，树立个人威信，反对共产党的领导。并和右派分子、教授夏定友勾结一起，以反对迁院为借口，煽动学生搞大民主，揭开盖子。杨志农公然要求中共农学院党委作出“迁院是个错误”的决定。在民盟支部召开的座谈会上，暗中唆使人发言，反对迁院。中共四川省委统战部邀集农学院教职员去成都参加座谈会。杨志农趁机煽动出席座谈会的教职员坚持反对迁院，并组织人发言，说在雅安建院，“好像把一株树移植到沙漠里”。说：“不把学校迁回成都，说不定要闹大民主。”杨志农甚至情不自禁地说，雅安的“火”已经燃起来了。
    6月15日当广播电台、报纸发表了杨、夏的发言之后，学生中的右派分子李德培、杨序贤，共青团叛徒赵彬昌等纠结部分学生立即张贴了大批反动大字报和标语，成立“行动委员会”，积极准备罢课、请愿、游行。赵彬昌并煽动学生丢掉党员、团员身份，参加闹事。李德培在广播中煽动全院学生积极行动起来，搞大民主。提出了坚决支持杨志农、夏定友谈话等七项计划。右派分子控制了学生会和广播器，非法地组织了四个警卫组，监视师生进出学校大门，监视党员副院长郝笑天的行动，还扬言要捆绑党委书记。他们决定要闹到中共雅安地委、选出去成都请愿代表，筹备举行欢迎杨志农、夏定友的大会。这时全校一片乌烟瘴气。
    16日早晨，他们派出联络组到雅安市工农速成中学等学校，煽动学生罢课、在街上张贴反动标语，发出“反对最高机关——国务院”，“打倒省委宣传部长杜心源”，“打倒省高教局长康乃尔”，“支持和拥护杨、夏的发言”等狂妄叫嚣。并且威胁市民说，谁要撕掉这些标语，就把谁抓走。当天，他们派代表去成都请愿，有七十多名学生到汽车站买票。售票员为了照顾广大旅客需要，拒绝一次售给他们全部车票，这群学生就又叫来一百多同学，把车站团团围住，要挟售票员售给他们车票。车站职工严词拒绝了他们的无理要求。学生梁伯康等几人摘下学校证章，冒充税局干部，冲进车站经理室，又要挟车站经理售票。附近工人、市民纷纷前来劝说学生不要无理取闹。学生田树伦竟辱骂群众，引起群众极大愤慨。有位老太婆指着自己衣服以自己生活变化当面斥责这些学生。在群众严词斥责下这些学生见势头不好，纷纷逃回学校。他们张贴的反动标语被市民撕个一干二净。
    这批闹事学生受到群众正义谴责之后，还不知悔悟，在右派分子操纵之下，立即鼓动几百名学生扣押了地委住校整风工作组的两个干部，说他们是“可疑的人”，“共产党的便衣警察”，“特务”。要揍他们。接着，把他们推来推去，分别带到学生会、俱乐部，非法组织法庭，连续审讯四、五小时。最后强迫他们在右派分子拟好的“口供”上签名，承认他们曾到车站煽动群众，阻止学生请愿代表购票等莫须有的“罪名”。
    17日，右派分子反动气焰更加猖狂，大量张贴反动大字报，在广播中辱骂当地党、政府和群众，附近工人、市民忍无可忍，有五、六百群众自发地拥进校内，抗议右派分子的反动行为，撕掉了校内反动的大字报和标语，群众指责闹事学生说：“你们住的是雅安最漂亮的房子，吃的是人民的大米，你们有良心没有？”要求杨志农出来答话。很多群众高唱：“没有共产党，就没有新中国”的歌子。当时右派学生竟诬蔑群众是“伪装居民”，“流氓”，并混在人群中间，打了前来维持秩序的市委书记和市人民法院院长等三位同志。
    18日，雅安市群众忍不住愤怒，又到学校内贴了许多标语和大字报，劝告大学生们站在人民立场，要求闹事学生承认错误。经过座谈学生代表接受了群众意见，开始承认了自己的错误。当天，雅安市政协召开了常委扩大会议，各民主党派负责人，省、市人民代表和列席的工人、农民代表一致驳斥了杨志农、夏定友的反动言论，再一次警告农学院学生不要再上右派分子的当。
    从此，全校师生明确了方向，向杨、夏和学生中的右派分子展开了斗争，扑灭了这股罪恶的火焰。
