    Digging out another crime of Luo Longji sabotaging the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries from a henchman of Luo Longji in Chengdu
    (Our newspaper dispatch) This newspaper published a letter from Shao Ciyun, Luo Longji's secretary, to Shen Junru and the Central Committee of the China Democratic League on July 4, mentioning that Luo had met Chen Kun, who was being struggled against in the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries at the Chengdu Institute of Technology, during his inspection in Sichuan.

    Who is Chen Kun? He infiltrated the Communist Party in 1937, but because he consistently opposed the Party and its leadership, undermined the Party's policies, shielded landlords and despots, was of poor character, and engaged in immoral behavior with women, he was expelled from the Party in 1952 after repeated attempts to reform him. Since then, Chen harbored resentment towards the Party and slandered Party organizations everywhere. During the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries, the Party organization of the Chengdu Institute of Technology, based on his consistent anti-Party behavior and close ties with key Hu Feng elements such as Xie Tao, found it completely necessary to investigate him. However, he felt wronged. Last winter, when Luo Longji came to Chengdu under the guise of inspection and collected materials of dissatisfaction with the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries, Chen visited Luo Longji twice, whom he had worked with at the Democratic Newspaper in 1946, and falsely accused the institute of expanding the scope of attack and wrongly struggling against people. Luo also said that he knew the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries at the Institute of Technology was terrible, with hundreds of people struggled against and over a hundred imprisoned. Luo also said to Chen: "Inspecting the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries is my task. If there are others in your area who have opinions about the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries, bring them to see me, and I can appeal for them and redress their grievances." Based on Luo's instructions, Chen not only wrote a letter of appeal himself but also incited and gathered some people who were dissatisfied with the Party to make representations to Luo. He also said, "If the Provincial Party Committee does not resolve the issue, we will appeal to the Central Committee, and if the Central Committee does not resolve it, we will file a complaint internationally." When some people did not go, Chen criticized them for being indecisive. During the blooming and contending period, Chen stirred up trouble everywhere and attacked the Party.

    In order to expose his anti-Party words and deeds, the Institute of Technology recently held a series of meetings to criticize him. At the meeting, Wang Hongwen of the Personnel Department, as well as Xiang Zhen, Zhao Shengxin, Liu Zulie, and others who were investigated during the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries, revealed many facts to expose Chen's rumors and slanders against the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries, pointing out that rightists were not allowed to reverse the verdict on the issue of the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries, and Chen's letter of appeal was a book of lies. During the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries, the institute actually only investigated seventy-five people, accounting for only 2% of the total number of people in the institute, while Luo and Chen fabricated rumors that the Institute of Technology wrongly struggled against more than three hundred people and wrongly imprisoned more than one hundred people.

    Under everyone's exposure, Chen lowered his head and confessed his guilt, saying that Luo Longji's use of his letter of appeal, which distorted and exaggerated the shortcomings of the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries, was his crime.

    从罗隆基在成都的一个喽啰那里
    挖出罗隆基破坏肃反的又一件罪行
    本报讯　本报7月4日刊登罗隆基的秘书邵慈云给沈钧儒和民盟中央的一封信说到罗来四川视察时曾接见成都工学院肃反被斗争的陈堃。
    陈堃是怎样一个人呢？他1937年混进共产党，由于他一贯反党反领导，破坏党的政策，包庇地主恶霸，品质恶劣，玩弄女性，屡教不改，1952年被开除党籍，自此，陈对党怀恨在心，到处污蔑党的组织。肃反中，成都工学院党组织，根据他一贯反党以及和胡风骨干分子谢韬等密切联系的事实，对他进行审查，是完全必要的，但他认为冤屈了他。去冬，当罗隆基借视察名义来成都到处收集对肃反不满材料时，陈两次去拜访早在1946年曾与他在民主报共事过的罗隆基，向罗造谣申诉该院如何扩大打击面，错斗人，罗也说他知道工学院肃反很糟，斗了几百人，关了一百多。罗并对陈说：“视察肃反是我的任务，你们那里还有那些人对肃反有意见，把他们引来见我，我可为他们申冤平反。”陈根据罗的指示，除自己写了一封申诉书，还煽动纠合一些对党不满的人，向罗申述。还说，“如果省委不解决，就告到中央，中央不解决，就到国际上去控告。”当有人不去时，陈就批评他不坚定。鸣放中，陈又到处点火，向党进攻。
    工学院为揭穿他的反党言行，最近连续召开会议进行批判。会上，人事处王宏文以及在肃反中被审查的向震、赵生信、刘祖烈等均以许多事实揭露陈造谣污蔑肃反，指出不许右派在肃反问题上翻案，陈的申诉书是谎言书。肃反中全院实际只审查七十五人，仅占全院人数2％，而罗陈则造谣说工学院错斗了三百多，错关了一百多。
    在大家揭发下，陈才低头认罪，说罗隆基利用他那封歪曲夸大肃反缺点的申诉书，是他的罪过。
