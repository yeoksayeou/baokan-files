Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, August 4th. The Imam of Oman, Ghalib bin Ali, appealed to the United Nations on August 3rd to stop British aggression against Oman.

Halsai, the representative of the Imam of Oman in Cairo, said that he had received a telegram from Issa, the former administrative chief of the eastern region of Oman and current representative of the Imam in Dammam, Saudi Arabia, ordering him to send this appeal by telegram to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld.

Halsai said that Oman is not a member state of the United Nations and has no right to request the United Nations to hold a meeting to discuss this matter, but hopes that a friendly country will take such a step. He added that Oman has not asked any specific country to take this action, but would welcome any such move.

Earlier on August 3rd, Halsai visited the Secretary-General of the Arab League, Hassouna. It is reported that Halsai handed over a telegram from the Deputy Imam of Oman to the Arab League, requesting member states of the League to step up assistance. On the same day, he also met with the President of the Egyptian Red Crescent Society to discuss the issue of providing medical assistance to the Omani rebels.

According to the Middle East News Agency, Hassouna held several talks with representatives of the Bandung Conference countries on the Omani issue on August 3rd.

Prior to this, Hassouna had met with the US Ambassador to Egypt, Herl, on August 2nd to discuss the Omani issue.

    阿曼吁请联合国制止英国侵略
    新华社开罗4日电　阿曼教长加勒布·本·阿里在8月3日向联合国呼吁制止英国对阿曼的侵略。
    阿曼教长驻开罗代表哈尔赛说，他接到了前阿曼东部地区行政长官、现任驻沙特阿拉伯丹曼的教长代表伊萨的一封电报，命令他把这个呼吁以电报发给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德。
    哈尔赛说，阿曼并非联合国会员国，无权要求联合国举行会议来讨论这次事件，但是希望某个友好国家采取这样一个步骤。他又说，阿曼并未要求任何特定国家采取这一行动，但是将欢迎任何这样的动议。
    8月3日早些时候，哈尔赛曾经访问了阿拉伯联盟秘书长哈苏纳。有消息说，哈尔赛已经把阿曼副教长发来的一份电报交给了阿拉伯联盟，要求联盟国家加紧援助。当天他还会晤了埃及红新月会会长，讨论给予阿曼起义者以医药援助的问题。
    据中东通讯社报道，哈苏纳在8月3日曾就阿曼问题同万隆会议国家代表举行过几次会谈。
    在这以前，哈苏纳曾经在8月2日和美国驻埃及大使赫尔就阿曼问题举行过会谈。
