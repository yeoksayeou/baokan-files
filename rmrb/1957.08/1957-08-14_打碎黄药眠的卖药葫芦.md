Smashed is Huang Yaomian's Medicine Peddling Gourd
Wen Shan
In the ninth issue of 1957, the first page of the "Wenyi Bao" (Literary Gazette) published an article by Huang Yaomian entitled "Relieving the Various Concerns of Literary Criticism." This was the author's speech at a symposium, which was very sharp and fluent, reading as if listening to the author's innermost thoughts.

Reading this article, one smells something burning. Huang Yaomian complained, "I have written very few articles in the past few years," "Before, when I wrote articles, whether they were good or not was another matter, but when I wrote, I felt a sense of comfort in my heart. Now, when I write articles, it is often to complete a task," "Personal style is completely thrown to the winds." The so-called "before" refers to the years before liberation. In Huang Yaomian's feeling, those years without the leadership of the Communist Party were truly "the sea is wide for fish to leap, the sky is high for birds to fly." Not to mention "various concerns," there was really no concern at all, and he was very free. Therefore, when he wrote, he felt "a sense of comfort in his heart." But now, Huang Yaomian feels very uncomfortable, so he writes less. This is very subtle. Many of us did not have the blessing to taste the "comfort" that Huang Yaomian mentioned "before." Only today do we dare to express our inner feelings to the fullest. We know how many talented authors shed blood in the past; why did Lu Xun, who hated obscurity, use so many euphemisms when writing essays. Under the watchful eyes of Kuomintang secret agents, Huang Yaomian actually felt so "comfortable" that he not only wrote a lot but was also able to develop his "personal style," so much so that he still misses the old days after many years.

Every class has its sense of smell, and its own idea of what is fragrant flower and what is poisonous weed. It is natural that Huang Yaomians find the flowers cultivated from the soil of workers, peasants, and soldiers unpleasant everywhere and wish they could all be trampled into the mud. Huang Yaomian said, "The works we print, middle school students read and generally think they are okay, but college students find them not tasty enough and are not satisfied." What great contempt: the things written under your Communist Party's leadership, even middle school students don't necessarily like, they are only "generally considered okay," what are you so proud of?! What leadership of literature?! But I ask Huang Yaomian, works like "Defend Yan'an," "Living Grave," "Railway Guerrilla," "Three Thousand Miles of Rivers and Mountains," "Ripple in a Stagnant Pool," and many other good works, are snatched up in university libraries, and you actually say they are so worthless, you are really not honest!

Because you are not honest, you guess that other people are not honest either. You said, "After Comrade Zhao Shuli's 'Sanliwan' was published, many people wrote articles saying it was very good. ... But I see, he is not very sure of his own opinions, which gives people an ambiguous impression after reading it. This atmosphere has also affected the readers. Generally speaking, college students don't particularly like modern Chinese works, but when you ask them, they still say they are good. But the reason they say they are good is not because they have personally felt it, but because the 'Wenyi Bao' ... said it was good, so they followed suit." Huang Yaomian not only smeared Kang Zhuo and the "Wenyi Bao," saying that they were all lying, but also insulted the university youth who grew up under the education and training of the Communist Party, saying that they were like a group of echoing bugs. Since the Communist Party can only corrupt young people, it should get out of the way and let the young people follow you bourgeois professor gentlemen, and go to the "free world" of "independent thinking," isn't that what you think?

After completely negating our works, Huang Yaomian followed suit and went straight to the source of what he called "affecting the development of creation." As soon as he searched, he found "leadership ideology." He said, "In terms of leadership ideology, there is a simplistic theory of the relationship between world outlook and creation." What kind of simplification? "According to the theory of many of our comrades, it seems that with a proletarian world outlook, the problem of creation can be solved." Then he refuted it, saying, "We cannot wait until the writers' ideology is transformed before asking them to create, and ideological transformation is by no means just reading a few theoretical books. In the past few years, writers have always read some books, but why can't some people still write works?" I think Huang Yaomian is playing tricks. He used his left hand to fabricate a "theory," and then used his right hand to attack it, making it quite lively. Readers who do not understand the situation in the literary world are easily fooled by this trick. But I ask Huang Yaomian, "With a proletarian world outlook, the problem of creation can be solved," where did you dig out this "leadership ideology"? In which leader's article or report have you seen such an argument? Who told you to "wait until the writers' ideology is transformed before asking them to create"? And when did the Communist Party ever advocate that reading a few theoretical books can transform ideology and write works?

Huang Yaomian has been wearing the guise of a "left-wing literary artist" until today when he revealed his true colors. The first shot he fired was to try to overthrow the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party on the literary front. Chairman Mao has long said that dishonest people will not have good results. This is like fortune telling for people like Huang Yaomian. Now, isn't the gourd selling fake medicine already smashed?

    打碎黄药眠的卖药葫芦
    闻山
    1957年第九期文艺报第一版上，登了黄药眠的一篇文章，名曰“解除文艺批评的百般顾虑”。这是作者在一次座谈会上的发言，说得十分尖刻流畅，读之如聆作者心声。
    读这篇文章，鼻子里就像闻到一股烧焦东西的味道。黄药眠埋怨说：“几年来我写的文章很少”，“以前我写文章，好不好是另一个问题，但写起来，心里有舒畅之感，现在我写文章，往往是为了完成任务”，“个性风格完全丢到九霄云外”。这里所谓“以前”者，解放前之谓也。在黄药眠的感觉中，没有共产党领导的那些年头，对他真是“海阔从鱼跃，天空任鸟飞”，不要说“百般顾虑”，那真是一点顾虑也没有，自由得很。所以他写起来，就“心里有舒畅之感”。而现在呢，黄药眠感到十分不自在，于是乎写得少了。这就很妙。我们许多人在“以前”，都没福气尝到黄药眠所说的“舒畅”的滋味，只有在今天，我们才敢于尽情吐露心中的感触。我们知道，以前有多少天才作者流了血；厌恶晦涩的鲁迅，写杂文为什么要用那么多的曲笔。在国民党特务虎视眈眈之下，黄药眠居然感到如此“舒畅”，不但写得多，并且能够发挥他的“个性风格”，以至于多年之后，仍然对昔日缅怀不已。
    每个阶级都有它的嗅觉，都有自己心目中的香花与毒草。黄药眠们看到从工农兵生活土壤中培植出来的花朵，就处处不顺眼，恨不得都踩到泥里去，这是很自然的。黄药眠说，“我们印出来的作品，中学生读起来，大体上说还认为可以，但大学生就觉得不够味，不满足了。”这是多大的轻蔑：在你们共产党领导下写出来的东西，连中学生看了，都不见得满意，只不过是“大体上还认为可以”，你们还神气什么？！还领导什么文艺？！但我请问黄药眠，像“保卫延安”、“活人塘”、“铁道游击队”、“三千里江山”、“死水微澜”以及许多好作品，在大学图书馆里抢都抢不到，而你居然把它们说得那么不值钱，你也未免太不老实了！
    正因为你不老实，所以你猜想别的人也都不老实。你说：“赵树理同志的‘三里湾’发表以后，很多人写了文章，说好得很。……但我看，他对自己的意见也不大有把握，使人读过以后，引起了模棱两可的印象。这种风气也影响了读者。一般说大学生本不十分喜欢中国现代作品，但你问他，他还是说好。但他所以说好，倒并不是亲身感受到了，而是因为‘文艺报’……说好，他也就跟着说好了。”黄药眠不但污蔑康濯与“文艺报”，说他们讲的都是谎话，而且把在共产党教育培养下成长的大学青年污辱一番，把他们说成俨然是一群应声虫。共产党既然只能教坏青年，就该当滚蛋，让青年们跟着你们这些资产阶级教授老爷们走，走到“独立思考”的“自由世界”里去，你难道不是这样想的吗？
    在全部否定了我们的作品之后，黄药眠跟着就单刀直入，找他所谓的“影响了创作的发展”的根源。一找，就找到了“领导思想”。他说，“在领导思想方面，对世界观与创作的关系有简单化的理论”。怎样简单法呢？“根据我们很多同志的理论，仿佛无产阶级的世界观有了，就可以解决创作问题。”接着他就加以反驳，说什么“我们不能等到作家思想改造好了才请他们创作，而且思想改造也决不止是读几本理论书。这几年来作家们总是读了些书了，但为什么有些人还是写不出作品来？”我觉得黄药眠是在耍把戏，他用左手捏造了一种“理论”，又用右手向之进行攻击，搬弄得挺热闹，不懂文艺界情况的读者，是很容易被这种戏法愚弄的。但请问黄药眠，“无产阶级的世界观有了，就可以解决创作问题”，这是你从什么地方挖出来的“领导思想”？你在哪个领导人的哪篇文章、哪个报告里，看到过这样的论调？谁告诉你要“等到作家思想改造好了才请他们创作”？共产党又什么时候主张过读几本理论书就可以把思想改造好，可以写出作品来？
    黄药眠一直披着“左翼文艺家”的外衣，到今天才露出本来面目，第一炮，便想轰垮中国共产党在文艺战线上的领导。毛主席早就讲过，不老实的人是没有好结果的。这等于给黄药眠之流算了命。现在卖假药的葫芦不是已经被打碎了吗？
