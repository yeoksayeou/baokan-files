In the Struggle's Tempest

    A Steadfast Anti-Rightist University Professor
    Li Peilin Sternly Retorts, Frustrating the "Arsonist" Yin Yi
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Lai Denong
    When Yin Yi, a reporter from Guangming Daily, arrived in Shenyang under the orders of Chu Anping to stir up trouble, he believed he had found an ideal figure. He invited this person to a symposium and also conducted a private interview. This person was Li Peilin, a renowned professor at Shenyang Medical College.
    During his private interview with Li Peilin, Yin Yi used both "enlightenment" and "encouragement," before posing the question: "Many senior professors in the interior advocate for professors to govern the school. What do you think?" Li Peilin detected a strange flavor in the reporter's conversation. Instead of directly answering his question, he asked him: "Without the leadership of the Communist Party, what can be accomplished?" Yin Yi's "interview" failed. Still unwilling to give up, he sought out an introducer—Chen Yanzhi, the chairman of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, deputy mayor of Shenyang, and a rightist element—to lobby, planning to "interview" again. Chen Yanzhi told Li Peilin: The Guangming Daily reporter said you spoke very well, but not sharply enough, fearing you had more to say and were planning to visit you again. Li Peilin humorously replied, "My words are truly 'released' completely. There's no gunpowder left in the firecracker, and even the firecracker tube is broken." In the face of this steadfast professor, the rightist elements once again ran into a wall.
    Subsequently, Li Peilin gave the rightist elements a merciless response in the newspaper. Professor Li wrote: I resolutely oppose professors governing the school because I have twenty years of teaching experience in old China. I suffered losses, almost having to change teaching locations every two years. Professors governing the school caused serious sectarianism. I wholeheartedly support the leadership of the Communist Party. The consequences of higher education institutions without the leadership of the Communist Party are unimaginable.
    Li Peilin also said at a symposium convened by the school's Party committee: According to the rightist elements' logic, factories should also be completely managed by engineers and not be led by the Communist Party and the government. What nonsense is this! I disagree with pulling socialism backward.
    Li Peilin revealed at the symposium and in the newspaper that rightist elements had long used tactics such as provocation, discord, incitement, and enticement against him. Chen Yanzhi had "encouraged" him to boldly "speak out" at the CPPCC meeting, saying: Someone with your technical skills "at most would just change places to eat." Li Peilin angrily questioned Chen Yanzhi: "Where would I go to eat, to Taiwan? I won't do it!" Usually, Chen Yanzhi always portrayed himself as a representative of "intellectuals' interests." Li Peilin once questioned Chen: Besides the broad interests of the people, what special interests do intellectuals have? Li Peilin said, I am satisfied with the Communist Party; the rightist elements have mistaken their target.
    In the struggle against the rightist elements, Professor Li Peilin is an activist. He gave the rightist elements a head-on blow at gatherings held within the school, the CPPCC, and the China Democratic League.

    一个坚决反右派的大学教授
    李佩琳严词回击  “纵火犯”殷毅碰壁
    新华社记者  赖德浓
    当光明日报记者殷毅奉储安平之命来到沈阳点火时，自以为物色到了一个理想人物，邀请这个人参加座谈会，又向这个人作私人访问。这个人就是沈阳医学院名教授李佩琳。
    殷毅向李佩琳作私人访问时，又是“启发”，又是“鼓励”，然后提出：“关内许多老教授都主张教授治校，您以为如何”？李佩琳从记者的谈话中嗅到了一股怪味，没有直接回答他的问题，反问了他一句：“没有共产党的领导能作出什么事情呢”？殷毅在这次“访问”失败后仍不甘心，他又找介绍人——民盟沈阳市委员会主任委员、沈阳市副市长、右派分子陈彦之去游说，准备再去“访问”。陈彦之向李佩琳说：光明日报记者说你讲得很好，但不够尖锐，怕心中有话还未说完，打算再访问你。李佩琳幽默地回答说：“我的话真是‘放’完了，爆竹里面也没药了，连爆竹筒都炸破了。”在这位坚定的教授面前，右派分子又碰了壁。
    接着，李佩琳还在报上给了右派分子以无情的回答。李教授写道：我断然反对教授治校，因为在旧中国我有二十年教学经验，我吃过亏，几乎每两年换一个地方教书，教授治校造成严重宗派主义。我衷心拥护共产党的领导，高等学校没有共产党的领导其后果是不堪设想的。
    李佩琳还在学校党委召开的座谈会上说：要照右派分子的说法，工厂也得完全由工程师治理，不能由共产党和政府来领导了，这叫什么话！我不同意把社会主义拉回去。
    李佩琳在座谈会和报上揭发，右派分子早就对他施用了挑拨、离间、煽动和拉拢等手段。陈彦之曾“鼓励”他在政协会上大胆“鸣”“放”，并说：像你这样有技术的人“顶多不过换个地方吃饭”。李佩琳愤怒地质问陈彦之：“我到那里去吃饭，到台湾吗？我是不干的！”平时，陈彦之一向以“知识分子利益”代表者自居，李佩琳曾质问过陈：知识分子除了广大人民利益之外又有什么特殊利益呢？李佩琳说，我对共产党是满意的，右派分子认错人了。
    在反击右派分子的斗争中，李佩琳教授是一个积极分子，他在学校内和政协、民盟举行的集会上都曾给右派分子以迎头痛击。
