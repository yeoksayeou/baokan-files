Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 15th: The appearance of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company construction site is changing with each passing day, and the site is a scene of bustling activity.

Tens of thousands of builders are working hard on this construction site despite the summer heat, and countless trucks loaded with various building materials are rushing to the site. Many auxiliary workshops, factory buildings, and offices of No. 1 blast furnace, coking plant, refractory material plant, and sintering plant, which started construction successively from April, have already been built. No. 1 blast furnace, which started construction on July 1st, has completed its foundation work. In order to supply coke to No. 1 blast furnace, the coking plant will start production in the third quarter of next year. Currently, the foundation work for the coal storage towers of No. 4 coking furnace and No. 2 and No. 3 coking furnaces has been completed. The tall chimney of No. 1 coking furnace is also nearing its top. The refractory material plant and the sintering plant are also under intense construction. The main building of the sintering plant will officially commence construction in the next few days.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 16th: Daye Iron Mine, famous for its rich iron ore reserves, has entered a stage of intense construction. Over the past two years, the stripping project at Daye Iron Mine has progressed rapidly. The towering Jianshan (Sharp Mountain) has been lowered by sixty meters, and most of Shizishan (Lion Mountain) has also been cut away, getting closer and closer to the iron ore deposits.

The "three connections" project of transportation, electricity, and water at Tieshan is also being accelerated. The railway from Wuchang to Daye Tieshan had laid its last rail to Tieshan ten days ago; the Tieshan electric railway connecting this railway is also under construction. The roadbed for the first phase of the electric railway to Shizishan has now been completed, and a section of the track has been laid; the second phase of the line to Jianshan is also under construction.

The original water and electricity supply can no longer meet the needs of Tieshan's construction. Now, a large-scale regional transformer substation with an area of more than 30,000 square meters has been basically built.

The water source for Tieshan comes from Liangzi Lake, which is twenty-eight li away. A water intake platform built in the heart of this lake has been completed, and three booster pumping stations are also under construction. Along the route from Liangzi Lake to Tieshan, water pipelines are being laid intensively. (Picture attached)

    武钢工地的面貌日新月异
    大冶铁山剥离工程进展很快
    据新华社武汉15日电  武汉钢铁公司工地的面貌正在日新月异地变化着，工地上一片繁忙的景象。
    在这个工地上，数万名建筑者正在冒着夏季的炎热紧张施工，无数的载重汽车满载着各种建筑材料奔向工地。从4月份起陆续开工的一号高炉、炼焦化工厂、耐火材料厂和烧结厂的许多附属车间的厂房和办公室，已经建设起来。7月1日开工的一号高炉，已完成了基础工程。为了供应一号高炉焦炭，炼焦化工厂要在明年第三季开始生产。现在，四号炼焦炉和二号、三号炼焦炉的储煤塔基础工程已经完工。高大的一号炼焦炉烟囱也快砌到顶端了。耐火材料厂和烧结厂也在进行着紧张施工，烧结厂的主厂房在最近几天内将正式动工兴建。
    据新华社武汉16日电  以铁矿藏量丰富闻名的大冶铁山，已经跨入了紧张建设的阶段。两年来，大冶铁山的剥离工程进展很快，高耸的尖山下降了六十公尺，狮子山也被砍掉了大半边，距离铁矿床已经越来越近了。
    铁山的通车、通电和通水的“三通”工程也在加紧进行。从武昌到大冶铁山的铁路，在十天以前已经把最后一根铁轨铺到铁山；连接这条铁路的铁山电气铁路也正在修筑。通往狮子山的第一期电气铁路的路基现在已经完成了，并且铺筑了一部分轨道；通往尖山的第二期线路工程也在施工。
    原有的水电供应已经不能满足铁山建设的需要。现在，一个面积达三万多平方公尺的规模巨大的区域变电所已经基本上修建起来。
    铁山的水源来自二十八华里以外的梁子湖。在这个湖的湖心修建的一个引水台已经竣工，三个升压水泵站也在施工，从梁子湖到铁山的沿线，正在紧张地铺设输水管道。（附图片）
