    Laundry Team Leader
    Jiang Liu
    On Sunday, the biscuit factory's employee dormitory was noisy, with singing, stringed instruments, talking, and laughter all mixed together. Suddenly, Gao Shen, squatting on the ground shining his leather shoes, shouted in a shrill voice:
    "Auntie Liu is here!"
    The dormitory fell silent as if a zither string had broken. Everyone turned to look at Auntie Liu, and then greeted her in a cacophony of voices.
    Auntie Liu, carrying a bundle, nodded and said with a smile, "Oh! Why are you lazy young men staying home on such a nice day? Why don't you go out for a stroll?"
    "We know you're coming to inspect the hygiene! Who dares to leave their post!"
    "Hehe... Haha..." The young men erupted in a burst of boisterous laughter.
    Auntie Liu is the leader of the Fifth Group of the Dismantling, Washing, and Sewing Cooperative. She often comes to the biscuit factory's employee dormitory to solicit and deliver work, and the workers are very fond of her. She likes these hearty young men from the bottom of her heart. When the workers are at work, she comes to the dormitory alone to take away the dirty clothes, washes them clean, irons them neatly, and puts them back on the beds, never getting them mixed up. There are a few young men who are lazy and dirty, and she turns over their beds, finding some dirty shirts and smelly socks pressed under the mattresses to take away and wash. When she meets them, she points at them and scolds them. These people know that she has a sharp tongue but a soft heart, and only giggle mischievously at her.
    Auntie Liu put down her bundle amidst the laughter, wiping the sweat from her forehead with her sleeve. She saw Li Zhi pinching his left index finger, hissing in pain. She couldn't help but ask, "What's wrong?"
    "I pricked myself with a needle," Li Zhi replied, pursing his lips.
    "Oh! You're a grown man, how can you be so careless!" She took the clothes from Li Zhi's hand and asked in surprise, "Why are you sewing buttons with white thread?"
    As she spoke, she tore off the button and took out blue thread to sew the button back on securely. She checked the other buttons to see if they were secure. Finding that a button was missing from a chest pocket, she frowned and said, "If there's no button, things can easily fall out... Where's the button?" she asked Li Zhi. "I don't have one," Li Zhi replied. Auntie Liu immediately twisted off a button from her own clothes and wanted to sew it on. Li Zhi repeatedly exclaimed, "How can I allow that! How can I allow that!..."
    "Never you mind!" Auntie Liu snapped at him. She quickly sewed on the button and turned to distribute the clothes.
    In the southeast corner of the dormitory, Section Chief Zhang of the General Affairs Section and Old Yu were engrossed in playing chess. Auntie Liu walked up to them and grimaced at these two chess fanatics:
    "You're obsessed with these few pieces of dead wood..."
    "Oh! Who's that? I was just about to look for you!" Section Chief Zhang said with a smile when he looked up and saw Auntie Liu.
    "What's the matter?" Auntie Liu asked.
    "Our factory has new recruits, but we don't have enough work clothes. The superiors won't give us fabric to make new ones, so I want to wash and mend the fifty-odd old ones stored in the warehouse to make do. This is your job again."
    "What are you going to use to mend them?"
    "That's no problem. We applied for and got two bolts of Wufu fabric yesterday."
    "It's such a waste to use Wufu fabric! Why not cut up some of the old work clothes to mend them!"
    "Wouldn't that be too flimsy? Besides, there are already very few old work clothes, cutting some up would make even less!"
    "We'll sell your factory some work clothes! And we don't need ration coupons." Auntie Liu squinted her eyes and smiled mysteriously.
    "Where did you get the work clothes?" Section Chief Zhang raised an eyebrow, somewhat disbelieving.
    "Hey! Not only do we have them, but we can supply you with five hundred sets." After Auntie Liu finished speaking, she hurriedly walked back to her bundle, took out two sets of snow-white, beautiful work clothes and a set of blue Zhongshan suits, and spread them out in front of Section Chief Zhang. At this time, the people in the dormitory swarmed over, vying to see the clothes, and suddenly surrounded Auntie Liu.
    Section Chief Zhang asked in surprise, "Where did you get the fabric?"
    "You supplied it!" Auntie Liu said meaningfully.
    "Hey! Auntie Liu is joking again! Where would our factory get fabric?" Section Chief Zhang shook his head and retorted.
    "You don't believe me? These are made from your factory's discarded sugar sacks! We just washed them, bleached them, and made them into work clothes. The Zhongshan suits are what we made after dyeing them blue. I used to suggest that you stop selling the discarded sugar sacks to the mop cooperative to cut into small strips, that's such a waste, but you didn't agree... A few days ago, I bought some discarded sugar sacks from your factory, originally to use for mending socks, but someone suggested that it was too wasteful to mend socks, we should make clothes instead, so we tried to make these few..."
    After everyone heard Auntie Liu's explanation, they became excited and clicked their tongues in admiration. Old Yu suddenly asked, "Section Chief Zhang, how many discarded sugar sacks are stored in our factory's warehouse?"
    Section Chief Zhang lowered his head in shame and mumbled, "I'm not too sure."
    "I asked Shang Yi at the end of last month, he said there were six hundred and eighty-five. These sugar sacks can be made into five hundred work clothes or more than two hundred Zhongshan suits," Auntie Liu said as if counting her own treasures.
    Little Ma suddenly said with great enthusiasm, "We should suggest that the factory director give Auntie Liu a five hundred yuan bonus."
    As soon as Little Ma finished speaking, Auntie Liu said angrily, "Who cares about your five hundred yuan bonus? Hmph! Don't look down on people, our General Cooperative Director Li said it well, cooperatives are not just doing the increase production and practice economy movement for ourselves! We are mainly saving wealth for society!"

    洗衣小组长
    江流
    星期天，饼干厂的职工宿舍里闹嚷嚷的，唱、拉、说、笑混成一片。突然，蹲在地上打皮鞋油的高深，尖着嗓门喊：
    “刘大妈来啦！”
    寝室里像琴断了弦，霎时沉寂，人们都扭头瞧刘大妈，随着又乱嘈嘈地和刘大妈打招呼。
    刘大妈手里拎着包袱，边点头、边笑嘻嘻地说：“噢！你们这群小伙子咋这么懒，这样好天气蹲在家里干啥？不出去蹓蹓。”
    “知道你要来检查卫生嘛！谁敢擅离职守啊！”
    “嘿嘿……哈哈……”小伙子们一阵粗犷的笑声。
    刘大妈是拆洗缝合作社第五小组的组长。常来饼干厂职工宿舍揽活送活，工人们对她非常亲热。她对这些豪爽的小伙子们打心眼里喜欢。工人们上了班，她一个人来到宿舍里把脏衣服拿走，洗干净、熨利落后又送回床上，从来没有送错。有几个小伙子又懒又脏，她把他们的床铺都翻一遍，找出一些压在褥子底下的脏衬衣、臭袜子等拿去洗。碰见他们时，便指着他们鼻子训一通。这些人知道她是刀子嘴、豆腐心，只对她顽皮地嘻嘻笑着。　　　
    刘大妈在大家的笑闹里放下包袱，用袖头揩揩额上汗。一眼看见李志捏着左食指，嘴里不住咝咝倒抽气。她不由的问：“咋的啦？”
    “被针扎了一下”李志吧嗒一下嘴答。
    “唉！挺大个人，咋不知道小心呵！”她把李志手里的衣服接过来，惊异地问：“你咋用白线钉钮扣？”
    说着，把钮扣掀下来，掏出青线把钮扣重钉好。并检查别的扣子是否牢靠。发现了胸兜缺个钮扣，皱皱眉说：“没扣，装上东西可容易丢……钮扣呢？”问李志。“没有。”李志答。刘大妈一下在自己身上拧下个钮扣要钉上。李志连声地嚷：“这怎么好！这怎么好！……。”
    “你别管！”刘大妈哼嗒他一句。迅速地钉好钮扣，一扭身分发衣服去了。
    寝室东南旮旯里，总务股张股长和老于正聚精会神地下棋。刘大妈走到他们身旁，对这两个棋迷??嘴：
    “看这几块死木疙瘩把你们迷的……。”
    “吓！我当谁呢？正好我还要去找你呢！”张股长一抬头瞧见是刘大妈，满脸铺笑地说。
    “有啥事？”刘大妈问。
    “咱厂不是新添人啦吗？工作服不够用，作新的上级又不给布，我想把仓库里存的五十来件旧的洗洗补补凑合用。这又是你的事啦。”
    “用啥补呀？”
    “这没问题，昨天我们申请下来二匹五福布。”
    “用五福布多可惜呀？干吗不剪掉一部分旧工作服补啊！”
    “那能结实么？再说，旧工作服本来很少，再剪掉一些更不够啦！”
    “我们卖给你厂一些工作服吧！也不要布票。”刘大妈?了一下眼睛，神密地微笑着。
    “你们从哪来的工作服？”张股长翘起半拉嘴唇有点不信地问。
    “嘿！不但有，还可供给你们五百套。”刘大妈说完，匆匆地走回包袱跟前，拿出两套雪白漂亮的工作服和一身蓝瓦瓦的中山服，向张股长面前一摊。这时寝室里的人蜂拥而来，争瞧这几件衣服，一下子把刘大妈团团围住。
    张股长诧异地问：“你们那来的布啊？”
    “你们供应的嘛！”刘大妈意味深长地说。
    “哎！刘大妈又说笑话哩！咱厂哪来的布啊？”张股长摇头搔首地反驳说。
    “你不信么？这是用你们厂废糖包作的哟！我们不过洗洗，漂白了，就作成了工作服，中山服是我们染蓝了后作的。我过去建议你们废糖包不要再卖给墩布合作社剪碎布条了，那多浪费呀，可惜你们不同意……。前几天从你们厂子买些废糖包，本来留作补袜子用，后来有人提议补袜子太浪费啦，应该改作衣服，因此，我们才试作这几件……。”
    大家听完刘大妈的说明后，都兴奋起来，不住地啧嘴。老于忽然问：“张股长，咱厂仓库里存多少废糖包？”
    张股长惭愧地低下头，嗫嚅的说：“我不太清楚。”
    “上月底我问过尚义，他说有六百八十五个，这些糖包可作五百件工作服或者作二百多套中山服。”刘大妈如数家珍般说着。
    小马陡地神采飞扬地说：“我们应该建议厂长给刘大妈五百元奖金”。
    小马的话音刚落，刘大妈便气呼呼地说：“谁希罕你们五百块钱奖金？哼！别小看人，咱们总社李主任说的好，合作社不单是为自己才搞增产节约运动呵！主要为社会上节约财富哇！”
