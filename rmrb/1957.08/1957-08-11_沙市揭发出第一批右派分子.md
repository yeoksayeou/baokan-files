    First Group of Rightists Exposed in Shashi
    Xinhua News Agency Special Dispatch, Shashi: A group of rightists has recently been exposed in Shashi, Hubei Province. They are Ye Shuping, Luo Shaoyu, and Zhang Kuanxun.
    Ye Shuping and Luo Shaoyu are both middle school teachers and responsible persons of the municipal organization of the China Democratic League and middle schools; Zhang Kuanxun is the Secretary-General of the Shashi Federation of Industry and Commerce. Ye Shuping was so arrogant that he even proposed that "non-Party members should participate in the leadership of the Communist Party branch." Luo Shaoyu actually advocated developing two million people to join the League. Zhang Kuanxun slandered the socialist transformation as the "tightening headband that the Communist Party put on the bourgeoisie."
