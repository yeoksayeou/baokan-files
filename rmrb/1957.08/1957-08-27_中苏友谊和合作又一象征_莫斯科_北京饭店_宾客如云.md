　　Another Symbol of Sino-Soviet Friendship and Cooperation
　　Moscow's "Beijing Restaurant" is Crowded with Guests
　　In Moscow, as people follow Bolshaya Sadovaya Street into Mayakovsky Square, they can see a fourteen-story tower-shaped building from afar. This is the well-known "Peking Hotel" in Moscow. The new site of the "Beijing Restaurant," the second largest hotel in the Soviet Union, which was completed not long ago, is located on the left wing of this hotel.
　　This newly built restaurant officially opened for business on July 27. It is a unique building where people can not only eat authentic Chinese cuisine but also appreciate Chinese national-style decorative art. Two days before the opening, Soviet leaders Khrushchev, Suslov, and Furtseva visited the restaurant, praised the new building, and commended the Chinese comrades who participated in the construction work.
　　The entire restaurant has three dining halls. Upon entering, there is a small round hall with a Temple of Heaven-style dome. Through the small round hall, there is a magnificent rectangular hall, which is the First Hall and the largest and most splendid of the three halls. At the end of the hall is a huge picture of Tiananmen Square, which gives people a pleasant feeling under the illumination of the lights. In front of the Tiananmen picture is the bandstand, and on the pillars on both sides of the bandstand are couplets written by Guo Moruo: "Every grain in the plate is the result of hard work; everyone at the table enjoys different delicacies." The sides of the hall are decorated like the Long Corridor of the Summer Palace. More than 300 Soviet-style painted pictures of different content on the large beams, including landscapes, scenery, and figures, are mostly from the hands of Chinese painting masters. The ceiling of the hall is also ingeniously designed. It is set between the golden eaves on both sides, and the entire ceiling is painted in a soft sky blue, which looks like a clear sky without clouds under the illumination of the surrounding reflector lamps.
　　Further inside is the Second Hall, which is decorated differently from the First Hall. Beijing-style paintings, green pillars, arched roofs, and large red palace lanterns are designed to imitate the Grand Theater of the Summer Palace.
　　The Third Hall is specially used for holding grand banquets, so it is also called the Banquet Hall. The hall is hung with inverted bucket palace lanterns painted with colorful paintings, has rosewood carved furniture, the walls are decorated with golden Hangzhou brocade, and the top of the hall is decorated with colorful paintings of cranes, mandarin ducks, goldfish, etc., which Chinese people have always used to symbolize peace and happiness, plus the huge Chinese painting "Long Live Peace" on the wall, makes this hall appear particularly solemn and magnificent.
　　The entire design of the restaurant was completed in cooperation between Chinese and Soviet architects, and all the decorative materials and various furnishings in the hall were shipped from China. In addition, several Chinese painting craftsmen and carpenters were specially invited from China.
　　The main feature of this restaurant is of course its food. Opening the Chinese-Russian bilingual menu, the names of the dishes listed on it are all familiar to Chinese people, such as braised shark fin, sea cucumber with shrimp roe, and Peking roast duck. In order to ensure the taste of the dishes, many ingredients are shipped from China, and six chefs are specially hired from China.
　　Since its opening, the restaurant has been praised by customers. Many Muscovites and foreign guests visiting Moscow like to come here to taste Chinese food and learn how to use Chinese bowls and chopsticks.
　　The day before the restaurant opened, Bobrovnikov, Chairman of the Moscow City Soviet, held a banquet for the opening of the restaurant. Some leaders of the Soviet Party and government, representatives of the Moscow City Party and Soviet, representatives of the working people, and Soviet and Chinese architects and workers who participated in the construction work attended the banquet. At the banquet, Furtseva, Ignatov, and Bobrovnikov, members of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee, delivered speeches and toasts successively. In their speeches, they all emphasized Sino-Soviet unity and pointed out that the "Beijing Restaurant" is a symbol of Sino-Soviet friendship and cooperation. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

　  中苏友谊和合作又一象征
　　莫斯科“北京饭店”宾客如云
    在莫斯科，人们顺着大农园街进入马雅可夫斯基广场，远远地就可以看到一座十四层的塔形建筑物，这是莫斯科闻名的“北京旅馆”。不久前才竣工的全苏联第二个大饭店——“北京饭店”的新址就座落在这个旅馆的左翼。
    这个新建的饭店已经在7月27日正式开始营业。它是一个别具风格的建筑物，在这里，人们不但可以吃到道地的中国菜，而且还可以欣赏到中国民族形式的装饰艺术。在开幕的前两天，苏联领导同志赫鲁晓夫、苏斯洛夫、福尔采娃等到这家饭店参观，曾经称赞这座新建筑，并且表扬了参加兴建工作的中国同志。
    整个饭店有三个餐厅。一进门是一个天坛顶式的小圆厅，通过小圆厅往里去，是一个金碧辉煌的长方形大厅，这是第一厅，也是三个厅中最大和最富丽堂皇的一个。大厅的彼端是一幅巨大的天安门图景，在灯光的映照下给人一种愉快的感觉。天安门图景前是音乐台，音乐台两旁的柱子上题着郭沫若写的对联：“盘中粒粒皆辛苦，席上人人尽异珍”。大厅两旁是仿照颐和园长廊装饰起来的。大梁上大小三百多幅内容不同的苏式彩画，有山水、风景、人物，大部分是出自中国彩画匠师之手。大厅的天花板也设计得别出心裁，它衬托在两边金黄色的屋檐之间，全部天花板都涂成柔和的天蓝色，在四周反光灯的照射下有如万里无云的碧空。
    往里走是第二厅，它的装饰和第一厅不同。京式的彩画、绿色的大柱、拱形的屋顶、大红的宫灯，这是模仿颐和园大戏台设计的。
    第三厅是专门用来举行盛大宴会的，所以又叫做宴会厅。厅内挂着画有彩画的倒八斗宫灯，有红木雕花的家具，墙上装饰着金黄色的杭州织锦，大厅顶上是中国人历来用以象征和平幸福的仙鹤、鸳鸯、金鱼等彩画，再加上墙上巨幅中国画“和平万岁”，使这个大厅显得特别庄严华丽。
    饭店的全部设计工作都是中苏建筑师共同合作下完成的，全部装饰材料和厅内各种摆设家具都从中国运来。此外，还特地从中国请来若干名彩画工匠和木工。
    这个饭店的主要特色当然是它的饭菜。翻开中俄文对照的菜单，上面所列的菜名都是中国人所熟悉的，例如红烧鱼翅、虾子海参、北京烤鸭之类。为了保证菜肴的口味，许多原料都从中国运来，并且还特地从中国聘请了六位厨师。
    饭店开幕以来深受顾客赞美，许多莫斯科人和到莫斯科来的外国客人都喜欢到这里来尝尝中国菜，学学使用中国碗筷。
    在饭店开始营业的前一天，莫斯科市苏维埃主席波布罗夫尼科夫曾经为饭店的开幕举行了宴会。苏联党和政府的一些领导人、莫斯科市党和苏维埃的代表、劳动人民的代表，以及参加建筑工作的苏中建筑师和工人们都出席了宴会。在宴会上，苏共中央主席团委员福尔采娃、伊格纳托夫以及波布罗夫尼科夫曾经先后讲话和敬酒。在讲话中，他们都强调中苏团结，并且指出，“北京饭店”是中苏友谊和合作的象征。　（据新华社）
