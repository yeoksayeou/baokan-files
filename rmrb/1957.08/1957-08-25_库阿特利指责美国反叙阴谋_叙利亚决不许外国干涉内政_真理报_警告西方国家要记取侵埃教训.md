Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, August 24th: Syrian President Kuwatly said on August 22nd that President Eisenhower's comments on the situation in Syria on August 21st were "regrettable." He charged: "The Western countries should bear most of the responsibility for the current tense and turbulent situation in the Middle East."

Kuwatly made these remarks when he met with a reporter from "Al-Ahram" in Alexandria.

Regarding the recent uncovering of the American-orchestrated conspiracy to overthrow the Syrian government, Kuwatly said: "It is not the first time that foreign imperialism has plotted to undermine the independence of liberated countries. There have been many conspiracies of various kinds before, all aimed at undermining our independence and obstructing our liberation policies."

He said that the Arab nationalism that is emerging with overwhelming force is vigilantly guarding against all these conspiracies. The universal national consciousness of the Arabs can prevent all conspiracies from succeeding, and render futile all meetings held to oppose this national consciousness of the Arabs.

He said that the responsibility for the current tense relations between Syria and the United States lies not with Syria but with the United States. He also said: "Syria will never tolerate foreign interference in its internal affairs, now or in the future. It will not hesitate to defend itself, so that its security and sovereignty are not threatened."

Kuwatly refuted the Western countries' claim that Syria is turning to communism. He said, "I regret that the West cannot distinguish between communism, liberation policies, and Arab nationalism. It seems that the West regards anyone who does not follow its path as a communist." He reiterated Syria's established policy of neutrality and non-alignment. He said that Syria hopes to unite with other neutral and independent countries through this policy to form a third force between the two blocs, protect the world from the threat of conflict and war, and spread the principles of peace, justice, and freedom among the people of all countries.

He demanded that Western countries, especially the United States, stop interfering in Syria's internal affairs and stop trying to drag it into the Baghdad Pact or make it accept the "Eisenhower Doctrine."

Regarding Syria's recent economic negotiations with the Soviet Union, the Syrian President said: "If someone understands our position and our goodwill, and extends a clean and honest hand to provide us with unconditional assistance, so that we can strengthen our economy as well as our liberation and neutrality policies, strengthen our army to defend our independence, and guard against the insidious actions of Zionism, which imperialism has cultivated in the heart of the Arab world, in the most beloved place in Arab territory, then we are hopeful of receiving his assistance, whoever he may be."

The Syrian President also emphasized the importance of the proposal to establish a federation between Egypt and Syria. He said that the establishment of a federation is Syria's long-cherished wish, and this federation can become the core of Arab unity.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 24th: "Pravda" warned on the 23rd that Western countries engaged in conspiracies in the Middle East should not forget the lessons of the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt.

An article published in the newspaper pointed out that the materials recently published in Syrian newspapers prove that the main thread of a series of anti-Syrian government conspiracies that have been exposed is in Washington, and the command post of the conspiracy is the US Embassy in Damascus.

The article said that because the anti-government conspiracy has suffered a defeat in Syria, the Western propaganda machine is now launching provocative propaganda attacking Syria and its government. This country's efforts to strengthen cooperation with socialist countries, especially the results of the Moscow talks between the Syrian and Soviet government delegations, are being fiercely attacked. This propaganda is a smokescreen, which they are trying to use to cover up the subversive activities carried out by imperialists in the Arab East.

    库阿特利指责美国反叙阴谋
    叙利亚决不许外国干涉内政
    “真理报”警告西方国家要记取侵埃教训
    据新华社开罗24日电　叙利亚总统库阿特利8月22日说，艾森豪威尔总统8月21日就叙利亚局势所发表的评论是“令人遗憾的”。他指责说：“目前中东局势所以紧张和动荡不安大部分责任应当由西方国家担负”。
    库阿特利是在亚历山大港接见“金字塔报”记者的时候这样说的。
    关于最近破获的由美国策动的推翻叙利亚政府的阴谋，库阿特利说：“外国帝国主义为了破坏解放了的国家的独立而制造阴谋，这已经不是第一次。以前也有过许多形形色色的阴谋，目的都是要破坏我们的独立，阻挠我们的解放政策。”
    他说，以排山倒海之势出现的阿拉伯民族主义，正在警惕地提防所有这一切阴谋。阿拉伯人的普遍的民族意识能够使各种阴谋不能得逞，使为了反对阿拉伯人的这种民族意识而举行的各种会议归于徒然。
    他说，目前叙利亚同美国的关系之所以紧张，责任不在叙利亚而在美国。他又说：“叙利亚不论现在和将来都决不容忍外国干涉它的内政。它将毫不踌躇地进行自卫，使它的安全和主权不受威胁。”
    库阿特利驳斥了西方国家散布的所谓叙利亚正在转向共产主义的那种说法。他说，“我感到遗憾的是，西方竟然分不清共产主义、解放政策和阿拉伯民族主义之间的区别。看来西方把不遵循它的轨道的人都看作是共产党。”他重申叙利亚既定的中立和不参加联盟的政策。他说，叙利亚希望通过这种政策同其他中立的独立国家联合一致，在两个集团之间组成第三种力量，保护世界不受冲突和战争的威胁，在各国人民中传播和平、公正和自由的原则。
    他要求西方国家，特别是美国停止干涉叙利亚内政，不再设法把它拖进巴格达条约或者使它接受“艾森豪威尔主义”。
    关于叙利亚最近同苏联举行的经济谈判，叙利亚总统说：“如果有人了解我们的主张和我们的善意，向我们伸出干净而正直的手来向我们提供无条件的援助，使我们得以加强经济以及我们的解放和中立政策，加强我们的军队以保卫我们的独立，提防帝国主义在阿拉伯国土的心脏，在阿拉伯领土上最可爱的地方培植起来的犹太复国主义的奸险行径，那末，无论他是谁，我们都是希望得到他的援助的。”
    叙利亚总统还强调指出关于建立埃及和叙利亚联邦的建议的重要性。他说，建立联邦是叙利亚的宿愿，这种联邦可以成为阿拉伯大团结的核心。
    据新华社莫斯科24日电　“真理报”23日警告在中近东地区进行阴谋活动的西方国家不要忘记英、法侵略埃及的教训。
    这家报纸发表的一篇文章指出，叙利亚报纸最近发表的材料证明，被揭露出来的一连串反叙利亚政府的阴谋的主线在华盛顿，而阴谋的指挥部就是美国驻大马士革的大使馆。
    文章说，由于反政府的阴谋在叙利亚遭受失败，西方宣传机关现在展开了攻击叙利亚和它的政府的挑衅性宣传。这个国家要同社会主义国家加强事务合作的努力特别是叙苏两国政府代表团莫斯科会谈的结果，正在遭到猛烈的攻击。这种宣传是一种烟幕，它们企图利用这种烟幕来掩盖帝国主义者在阿拉伯东方所进行的颠覆活动。
