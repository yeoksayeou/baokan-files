Since Chairman Mao made the report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" at the enlarged meeting of the Supreme State Conference, although only five months have passed, these five months are by no means ordinary.

In these five months, the Party has led a massive and victorious struggle that concerns the destiny of the nation. This struggle is, on the one hand, a rectification movement against bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism; on the other hand, it has waged a victorious counterattack against the frantic attacks of the bourgeois rightists who took advantage of the rectification to attack our Party. This is an acute class struggle that determines whether the country will take the socialist road or the capitalist road.

In these five months, we have lived an intense political life. Under the leadership of the Party, we have been receiving education and undergoing tests. In the rapidly changing and complex struggle, although our thinking has not been able to keep up all at once, and we have even felt very strenuous at times, we have still kept up with the fighting ranks by taking steady steps thanks to the correct leadership of the Party.

Revolutionary practice is the touchstone for testing truth. We have once again gained a profound experience of this ordinary truth:

This victorious struggle against the bourgeois rightists, this great debate on the fundamental issue of the two roads of the country, has given us education that is not easily obtained from books: One is that it has raised class consciousness, which is not abstract but concrete; the other is that it has recognized the error of dogmatism, which is also not abstract, but is proven by the actual experience of the Party leading the people of the whole country in the struggle against the bourgeois rightists.

In the past, we were confident that we were materialists, and we seemed to know the truth that truth is not afraid of opposition, and the more it is debated, the clearer it becomes, but when the practical problems of revolutionary struggle were placed before us for us to solve, it proved that we did not truly understand this truth, and we were not thorough materialists.

In the past, we only generally understood that the revolutionary people are the source of all strength, and that to solve any practical problem of revolutionary struggle, we must take the mass line. As communists, our confidence in the inevitable victory of the revolutionary struggle is based on the understanding of the laws of social development and the infinite trust and loyalty to the revolutionary people. But when the practical problems of revolutionary struggle were placed before us for us to solve, it proved that we did not truly and thoroughly understand this truth, and we could not adhere to the mass line in any problem.

Therefore, last year, when we saw some right-leaning ideological viewpoints and negative phenomena in literature and art, we doubted the Party's policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," and adopted the erroneous viewpoints of "fear of letting go" and "solitary contention," which were contrary to the Party's policy in terms of direction and method, and hindered the blooming and contending. At the same time, in solving certain specific problems in literature and art, we also revealed some dogmatic understandings. As Communist Party members, this is a serious mistake.

Many comrades have made correct criticisms of our article "Several Opinions on the Current Literary and Artistic Work," pointing out that our main errors are: First, we made a wrong estimate of the situation in the literary and artistic circles after the Party put forward the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." We did not see the positive phenomena that played a leading role, but inappropriately exaggerated some secondary negative phenomena, thus shaking our confidence in the Party's policy of blooming and contending; second, the negative phenomena we criticized were not completely accurate. Some of them were not, or at least not entirely, negative phenomena, such as the discussion of socialist realism, the proposition of creative themes, the excavation and reorganization of traditional operas, and the increase of satirical works. These cannot be generally said to be negative phenomena; third, instead of implementing the Party's policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," and adopting a reasonable attitude and a method of debate to seek solutions, we adopted a simplified and rude attitude and a method of suppression towards certain erroneous ideological viewpoints, fully exposing the "left" dogmatic tendency in our thinking. We fully accept these correct criticisms.

Practice is the touchstone for examining everyone. The development of the situation in the past five months has proved this, and at the same time, it has made us more deeply aware of our mistakes. The facts tell us that we are not qualified Marxists, but Marxists who are tainted with more dogmatism.

Now we are faced with two tasks: One is to humbly listen to correct criticisms from all sides, study hard, overcome dogmatism, and resolutely and correctly implement the Party's policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." This is a task of self-remolding; the other is to actively engage in the struggle against the bourgeois rightists. This is a class struggle to defend Marxism, defend the Party, and defend the cause of socialist revolution. We believe that the two tasks are consistent. Only by overcoming dogmatism can we correctly implement the Party's policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," and vigorously smash the frantic attacks of the bourgeois rightists, and better complete the tasks that a communist fighter should complete.

We must resolutely overcome dogmatism, which is completely different from the bourgeois rightists who oppose "dogmatism" in name, but actually oppose Marxism. We oppose dogmatism in order to defend and develop true Marxism, while the bourgeois rightists are trying to overthrow Marxism. The boundaries between the two must be clearly drawn.

The reactionary words and deeds of the bourgeois rightists in the literary and artistic circles alone can prove this point.

There are hundreds of reactionary words and deeds of the bourgeois rightists in the literary and artistic circles, but they all achieve the same result through different means. To sum up, there are only a few main magic weapons, and these main magic weapons are mostly wrapped in a layer of sugar-coating of anti-dogmatism.

Their first magic weapon is called "You don't understand, let me do it."

Bourgeois rightists everywhere portray themselves as geniuses who know everything and are omnipotent, but portray the Party and the Party's leaders at all levels in the literary and artistic field as a group of uncultured, unlearned, incompetent people who, at best, can only recite a few sentences of Marxism and engage in a little politics.

What needs to be mentioned in particular is how they attack the literary and artistic work of the troops.

Everyone knows that our revolutionary literature and art have developed under the leadership of the Party, and our revolutionary literary and artistic ranks are composed of many Communist Party writers and non-Party progressive writers. Due to the characteristics of our country's revolutionary armed struggle, literary and artistic work has developed from the very beginning in our People's Army. And it has always been regarded as an important part of the political work of the troops and a powerful assistant. From the War of Resistance Against Japan until the Liberation War, a large number of writers went to Yan'an and the base areas behind enemy lines, and many literary and artistic workers joined the troops, and were severely tempered in the flames of the people's war. They wrote excellent works reflecting our country's great revolutionary struggle.

But the bourgeois rightists said that the Party's leadership over literary and artistic work was "dogmatic rule," and believed that we had no literature and art, only "formulaic and conceptualized history," thus completely negating our revolutionary literature and art in a few words.

The attack on the literary and artistic work of the troops is even more fierce. The bourgeois rightists first regard the People's Army as rude and uncultured, as if the only strength of our revolutionary soldiers is that they can still fight, but the weakness is ignorance and lack of culture. Therefore, they believe that the characteristics of the army are incompatible with literature and art. They describe the relationship between literary and artistic workers and leaders of political organs in the troops as the relationship between "scholars and soldiers," calling it a situation where scholars meet soldiers and cannot reason with them; they describe the leadership of political organs in the troops over literary and artistic work as dogmatism plus warlordism, calling it "leading culture with martial arts" and leading literature and art "in the manner of leading troops."

This is truly a great slander against the literary and artistic cause led by the Party, against the People's Army, and against the literary and artistic work in the People's Army.

Is our army an uncultured army? It depends on how you say it. There are two standards in this. One is the standard of the bourgeois rightists. According to their standards, they would think that the US imperialist army is the most cultured army, because the US imperialist army has the American-style "culture" that they love; the other standard is the standard of our people. We believe that the US imperialist army is the most uncultured, barbaric, and hostile to culture. This is determined by the decadent and reactionary class nature represented by the US imperialist army. And our People's Army is the army that attaches the most importance to culture, is the most cultured, and is improving its cultural literacy every day. This is also determined by the advanced nature of the class it represents. We must never tolerate the bourgeois rightists' wanton slander against the People's Army.

The reason why the bourgeois rightists maliciously describe the Party's leadership over literary and artistic work, including the leadership of the political organs of the troops over the literary and artistic work of the troops, has only one purpose, which is "You don't understand, let me do it," attempting to replace it. The slogans and methods put forward are "Let the literary and art be led by literary and artistic experts," "The Party committee cannot interfere in business," "Hand over the power to lead the business to the Art Committee," and let the cultural and artistic troupe "govern itself," and the leadership has no right to intervene. What kind of literary and artistic experts are they handing over the literary and art to? Of course, it will not be the "dogmatic" "red literary and artistic experts," but the "real literary and artistic experts" praised by the bourgeois rightists, that is, the "literary and artistic experts" of the bourgeois rightists, and let them form the Art Committee to replace the leadership of the Party committee.

How much talent do those so-called "real literary and artistic experts" really have? What do they really understand? We are all familiar with the history of bourgeois literature in our country. What they created were only literary and artistic works centered on decadent individualistic ideas and bearing the colors of comprador and feudalism. Even if some individuals had talent in the past, their so-called "talent" quickly withered because it was not combined with the people.

Their second magic weapon is called "A mess, step down quickly."

In order to prove that the Communists are indeed incompetent, the bourgeois rightists took out this second magic weapon. Since the literary and artistic cause led by the Party is a mess, with no achievements, only "stereotyped and mediocre works," "plays with no play," and films that "lose money in more than 70% of the cases," and have not cultivated new talented writers and new talented artists; since old writers have not written new works since the national liberation, and new writers cannot write "really bold works that interfere with life" under the "shackles of dogmatism"; since all the so-called "bad things" are caused by the leadership of the Party, then the inevitable conclusion is: "You have made a mess, when will you not step down?"

The achievements of our literary and artistic cause are the creation and labor of thousands of people under the leadership of the Party, and are the wealth of the people. Although we have some shortcomings, and although we are never satisfied, can we tolerate this malicious description of our glorious and sacred labor by the bourgeois rightists? What they negate is not only the leadership of the Party, but also the entire revolution, and the hard work of all revolutionary writers and artists for so many years.

Their third magic weapon is called "Want freedom, want democracy."

The bourgeois rightists pretend to be the most advocates of "freedom of creation." They claim that "dogmatists" have restricted their "freedom of creation," so they must fight for "freedom."

What are the things that are not "free" in their eyes? That literature and art should serve politics is the first thing that is not "free," that literature and art should serve workers, peasants, and soldiers is the second thing that is not "free," emphasizing going deep into life and transforming ideas is the third thing that is not "free," that bad works should be criticized, and poisonous weeds should be pulled out is the fourth thing that is not "free," and so on. In short, literature and art must obey the leadership of the Party, must serve socialism, and that the blooming and contending must have six political criteria, which in their eyes is the biggest thing that is not "free."

Their purpose is to oppose the Party spirit principle of literature with a big hat of dogmatism, and replace it with a "free" principle, so as to engage in bourgeois literature and art under the "free" principle of capitalism.

They feel that there is no freedom in literary and artistic work with the leadership of the Party. They yearn for absolute freedom and unlimited democracy. They hate collective life and hate organization and discipline, and attempt to turn the unified literary and artistic ranks led by the Party into a plate of loose sand, so as to develop small groups and achieve the goal of engaging in "Petofi Clubs."

These three magic weapons are the weapons used by the bourgeois rightists to frantically attack the socialist literary and artistic cause under the slogan of so-called "anti-dogmatism."

We wholeheartedly support using Marxism to oppose dogmatism. We must resolutely oppose using bourgeois ideas disguised as anti-dogmatism to oppose Marxism. The conspiracy of the bourgeois rightists, under the banner of anti-dogmatism, to use the rectification movement to attempt to usurp the Party's leadership over the socialist literary and artistic cause is doomed to failure in the face of the Party, the writers and artists who support socialism, and the broad masses of the people.

What is particularly worthy of our vigilance as literary and artistic workers in the troops is that the bourgeois rightists are not only using the above three magic weapons to launch a frantic attack on the literary and artistic work of the troops, attempting to disintegrate our literary and artistic ranks ideologically, but also have openly dared to reach out, woo writers and actors in the troops, and attempt to disintegrate our literary and artistic ranks organizationally from the inside out. For example, the rightist element Wu Zuguang once attempted to woo writers in the troops to join his gang and participate in his so-called "literary magazine"; the rightist elements Wen Yan and Dai Ya of the Beijing People's Art Theater, directly under the command of the rightist ringleader Luo Longji, dared to come to the Cultural and Artistic Troupe of the General Political Department to develop members of the China Democratic League, and attempted to pull the drama actors out of the troops to participate in their criminal plan to "restore the China Touring Theater." Although their conspiracy did not succeed, it cannot but arouse the serious vigilance of our literary and artistic workers in the troops. We must unite with all the literary and artistic workers of the army, resolutely cut off all the sinister black hands of the bourgeois rightists who dare to reach out to the literary and artistic ranks of the troops, and consolidate our literary and artistic ranks.

    克服教条主义投入反右派斗争
    陈其通　陈亚丁
    自从毛主席在最高国务会议扩大会议上，作“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告，到现在虽然只有五个多月，但这五个多月可决非寻常。
    党在这五个多月中，领导着一场巨大的、关系国家命运的、胜利的斗争。这一斗争一方面是反对官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义的整风运动；另一方面，对资产阶级右派利用整风向我党的猖狂进攻，进行了胜利的反击，这是一场决定国家走社会主义道路，还是走资本主义道路的尖锐的阶级斗争。
    五个多月中，我们过着紧张的政治生活。在党的领导下，我们接受着教育，经受着考验。在一日千里、错综复杂的斗争生活中，虽然我们的思想不是一下子就能跟得上的，有时甚至感到很吃力，但由于有党的正确领导，我们还是迈着正步跟上了战斗的队伍。
    革命的实践是检验真理的试金石。对这样一条平凡的真理，我们又一次得到了深刻的体验：
    这一场反对资产阶级右派的胜利的斗争，这一场关系国家两条道路的根本问题的大辩论，给了我们平常在书本上所不易得到的教育：一条是提高了阶级觉悟，它不是抽象的，而是具体的；一条是认识了教条主义的错误，它同样也不是抽象的，而是以党所领导的全国人民同资产阶级右派斗争的实际经验证明了的。
    过去，我们自信自己是唯物主义者，我们似乎也知道真理不怕别人反对，真理愈辩愈明的道理，但当革命斗争的实际问题摆在面前让我们来解决的时候，却证明了我们并不真正懂得这个道理，我们并不是彻底的唯物主义者。
    过去，我们只是一般地懂得革命的人民群众是一切力量的源泉，解决任何一个革命斗争的实际问题，都必须走群众路线，作为一个共产主义者，他对革命斗争的必胜信心，就是建筑在对社会发展规律的认识和对革命的人民群众的无限信任和无限忠诚的基础之上的，但当革命斗争的实际问题摆在我们面前让我们来解决的时候，就证明了我们并不真正透彻地懂得这个道理，在任何问题上都能坚持群众路线。
    因此，去年当我们看到了一些在文学艺术方面的右倾的思想观点和消极现象的时候，就对党的“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的政策产生了怀疑，采取了与党的政策在方针上和方法上都是相违背的“怕放”和“独鸣”的错误观点，阻碍了鸣放。同时，在解决某些文学艺术的具体问题上，也同样暴露出一些教条主义的理解。作为共产党员来讲，这是一种严重的错误。
    许多同志对我们所写的“对目前文艺工作的几点意见”一文进行了正确的批评，指出了我们的主要错误是：一，对党提出“百花齐放，百家争鸣”政策后文艺界的情况，作了错误的估计，我们没有看到起主导作用的积极的现象，而把一些次要的消极现象，不适当的夸大了。从而对党的鸣放政策产生了动摇；二，我们所批评的那些消极现象，也并没有完全看准，其中有一些并不是或者至少并不完全是消极现象，如对社会主义现实主义问题的讨论、创作题材问题的提法、传统剧目的挖掘整理、讽刺作品的增多等，这些都不能笼统地说是消极现象；三，对待某些错误的思想观点，不是贯彻执行党的“百花齐放，百家争鸣”政策，采取说理的态度、辩论的方法来求得解决，而是采取了简单化的、粗暴的态度，压服的方法，充分暴露了我们思想上的“左”的教条主义的倾向。我们完全接受这些正确的批评。
    实践是考查每一个人的试金石，五个多月来的形势发展就证明了，同时，也使我们更加深刻地认识了我们的错误。事实告诉我们：我们不是够格的马克思主义者，而是沾染了较多教条主义的马克思主义者。
    现在在我们面前提出了两个任务，一个是虚心地听取来自各方面的正确的批评，努力学习，克服教条主义，坚决地、正确地执行党的“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的政策，这是一个自我改造的任务；另一个是积极投入反对资产阶级右派的斗争，这是一个保卫马克思主义、保卫党、保卫社会主义革命事业的阶级斗争的任务。我们认为两个任务是一致的，只有克服了教条主义，才能正确地执行党的“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的政策，才能有力地粉碎资产阶级右派的猖狂进攻，比较好地完成一个共产主义战士所应该完成的任务。
    我们要坚决克服教条主义，这和资产阶级右派以反对“教条主义”为名，实际是反对马克思主义当然完全不同。我们反对教条主义是为了保卫和发展真正的马克思主义，资产阶级右派则是为了打倒马克思主义，两者的界线必须划得清清楚楚。
    单就文艺界资产阶级右派的反动言行就可以证明这一个论断。
    文艺界资产阶级右派的反动言行有千百条，但异曲同工，归纳起来不外几个主要的法宝，而这几个主要的法宝，又大都包着一层反教条主义的糖衣。
    他们的第一个法宝叫“你不懂，让我来”。
    资产阶级右派分子们到处都把自己描绘成无所不懂、无所不能的天才，却把党和党在文艺事业方面的各级领导人员，都描绘成一群没有文化的、不学无术的、才能低劣的、顶多是只会背诵几句马克思主义，只会搞点政治的人。
    特别要提一下的，是他们怎样攻击部队的文艺工作。
    谁都知道，我们革命的文艺是在党的领导之下发展起来的，我们革命的文艺队伍，是由许多共产党员作家和非党的进步作家组成的。由于我国革命武装斗争的特点，在我们人民军队中，从一开始就发展了文艺工作。并且一直当作部队政治工作的一个重要组成部分和有力的助手来看待的。抗日战争以后一直到解放战争时期，一大批作家到了延安，到了敌后根据地，并有不少文艺工作者参加了部队，在人民战争的火焰中受到了严峻的锻炼，他们写出了反映我国伟大革命斗争的优秀作品。
    但资产阶级右派却把党对文艺工作的领导说成是“教条主义的统治”，认为我们没有文艺，有的只是“公式化、概念化的历史”，这样，几句话就全盘否定了我们革命的文艺。
    对部队文艺工作就攻击得更加厉害了。资产阶级右派首先把人民的军队都看成是粗野的、没有文化的，好像我们革命军人的长处就是还能打仗，短处却是愚昧、没有文化。因此，认为军队的特点就是与文艺不能相容的。他们把部队中文艺工作者与政治机关领导之间的关系，说成是“秀才与兵”的关系，叫做秀才遇见兵，有理讲不清；把部队政治机关对文艺工作的领导说成是教条主义加军阀主义，叫做“用武化来领导文化”，“用带兵的方式”领导文艺。
    这真是对党所领导的文艺事业，对人民军队和人民军队中的文艺工作的天大的诬蔑。
    我们的军队是没有文化的军队么？看怎么说，这中间存在着两种标准，一种是资产阶级右派的标准，按照他们的标准，他们会认为美帝国主义的军队是最有文化的军队，因为美帝国主义的军队里有他们所爱好的美国式的“文化”；另一种标准是我们人民的标准，我们认为美帝国主义的军队是最没有文化的、野蛮的，而且是敌视文化的，这是美帝国主义军队所代表的腐朽的、反动的阶级性质所决定了的。而我们人民的军队，才是最重视文化、最有文化、每天都在提高着文化素养的军队，这也同样是由它所代表的阶级的先进性所决定了的。我们决不能容忍资产阶级右派对人民军队的肆意诬蔑。
    资产阶级右派之所以这样来恶毒地形容党对文艺工作的领导，包括部队政治机关对部队文艺工作的领导，目的只有一个，就是“你不懂，让我来”，企图取而代之。提出的口号和方法就是“把文艺交给文艺家领导”，“党委不能干涉业务”，“把领导业务的权力交给艺委会”，让文工团“自治”，领导上无权过问。倒底是把文艺交给什么样的文艺家呢？当然不会是“教条主义”的“红色文艺家”，而是资产阶级右派所称赞的“真正的文艺家”，也就是资产阶级右派的“文艺家”们，并由他们组成艺委会来代替党委的领导。
    那些所谓“真正的文艺家”们倒底有多大才能呢？他们到底懂些什么呢？我们都还熟悉我国资产阶级文学的历史，他们所创造的只是些以腐朽的个人主义思想为中心的，带有买办和封建色彩的文艺，即便其中过去有个别人确有才能，但他们的所谓“才能”由于没有和人民结合的原故，也很快就雕萎了。
    他们的第二个法宝叫“一团糟，快下台”。
    资产阶级右派为了证实共产党人确实无能，就拿出了这第二个法宝，既然党所领导的文艺事业是一团糟，毫无成就，有的只是“千篇一律的，平庸的作品”，“没有戏的戏”，“70％以上赔钱的”电影，也没有培养出新的有才能的作家和新的有才能的艺术家；既然全国解放以来，老作家没有写出新的作品来，新作家也在“教条主义的束缚”下写不出“真正大胆干预生活的作品来”；既然一切所谓“坏事”都是由于党的领导造成的，那么，必然的结论就是：“你们搞的一团糟，还不赶快下台等待何时”？
    我们文艺事业的成就，是在党所领导下的千百人的创造和劳动，是人民的财富。尽管我们有些缺点，尽管我们绝不满足，但我们能容忍资产阶级右派对我们光荣而神圣的劳动的这种恶毒的描写么？他们否定的不仅是党的领导，而且是整个的革命，全部革命作家、艺术家多少年的辛勤劳动。
    他们的第三个法宝叫“要自由、要民主”。
    资产阶级右派装做最主张“创作自由”的人，他们宣称“教条主义者们”限制了他们的“创作自由”，所以就非奋斗出个“自由”来不可。
    在他们看来到底有那些不“自由”呢？文艺要为政治服务是第一个不“自由”，文艺要为工农兵服务是第二个不“自由”，强调深入生活、改造思想是第三个不“自由”，不好的作品要受批评，毒草要被拔掉是第四个不“自由”，诸如此类等等。总之一句话，文艺要服从党的领导，要为社会主义服务，放和鸣要有六条政治标准，在他们看来是最大的不“自由”。
    其目的就是：要把文学的党性原则加上个教条主义的大帽子反对掉，换上一个“自由”的原则，好在资本主义的“自由”的原则下，搞资产阶级文艺。
    他们感到文艺工作有党的领导就不自由，他们向往绝对的自由和无限制的民主，他们厌恶集体生活，厌恶组织性、纪律性，企图使党所领导的统一的文艺队伍变成一盘散沙，借以发展小集团，达到搞“裴多菲俱乐部”的目的。
    这三个法宝是资产阶级右派在所谓“反教条主义”的口号下，向社会主义的文艺事业猖狂进攻的武器。
    用马克思主义反对教条主义，我们是全心拥护的，用披上反教条主义外衣的资产阶级思想来反对马克思主义，我们是要坚决反对的。资产阶级右派打着反教条主义的旗号，利用整风企图篡夺党对社会主义文艺事业的领导权的阴谋，在党和拥护社会主义的作家、艺术家和广大人民面前，是注定要失败的。
    作为部队的文艺工作者，特别值得我们警惕的是资产阶级右派不仅在用上述三个法宝向部队的文艺工作进行了猖狂进攻，企图从思想上来瓦解我们的文艺队伍，而且已经公然胆敢伸手，拉拢部队的作家和演员，企图里应外合从组织上来瓦解我们的文艺队伍，例如：右派分子吴祖光就曾经企图拉拢部队的作家入他的伙，参加他的所谓“同人刊物”；右派头子罗隆基直接指挥下的北京人民艺术剧院的右派分子文燕、戴涯竟敢到总政治部文工团来发展民盟盟员，并企图把话剧演员从部队中拉出去，去参加他们所谓“恢复中国旅行剧团”的罪恶计划。虽然他们的阴谋并没有得逞，但亦不能不引起我们部队文艺工作者的严重警惕。我们要和全军文艺工作者团结一致，坚决斩断一切胆敢伸向部队文艺队伍的资产阶级右派的罪恶的黑手，巩固我们的文艺队伍。8月10日
