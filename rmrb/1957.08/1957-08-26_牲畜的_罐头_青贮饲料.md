　　Livestock "Canned Food" - Silage
    The Daciluo Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shilou Township, Fangshan County, Hebei Province, has 303 large livestock, 1,138 pigs, and 175 sheep. Before cooperation, livestock fodder was generally self-sufficient. After cooperation, due to a lack of experience in collective livestock raising, difficulties arose with insufficient fodder, leading to weakened and dead livestock, which affected agricultural production.

    In 1956, the cooperative launched a silage campaign, storing more than 800,000 jin of corn stalks and sweet potato vines, equivalent to 160,000 jin of dry hay (5 jin of silage equals 1 jin of hay). This not only saved the cooperative a large amount of money, but also ensured that all livestock safely survived the winter and spring, ensuring spring plowing production, despite a shortage of grain feed. Xu Yuhe, deputy director of the cooperative, said: "Without silage, I don't know how many livestock would have died or weakened in these four or five months." He also said: "Given that the national standard for grain rations for livestock will not increase, supplementing with silage can maintain the original fatness. For example, a horse normally fed four jin of feed a day can maintain its original fatness with two jin of feed when silage is provided. Therefore, the masses say that silage is "canned food" for livestock."

    The silage season is during the busy farming season, and the timing of corn stalk silage work is very important. Therefore, preparations must be made in advance, and a concentrated campaign should be launched during silage so that the annual reserves can be completed within a few days. Silage must be cut, transported, chopped, put into the cellar, and sealed immediately to ensure quality; otherwise, it is prone to spoilage and mold. Before the corn is ripe, the part above the cob needs to be cut down for silage, which can maintain the rich nutrition of the corn stalks and also promote early maturity and full grain. Because the winter in the north is cold and the moisture content of the silage is high, it is easy to freeze after it is taken out of the cellar. Therefore, it is better to start feeding silage after February. Of course, if the livestock pen is well-equipped and does not freeze, it can be fed at any time.

    Based on the lessons learned from last year, the cooperative plans to launch a massive campaign to store silage this year. In addition to fully utilizing agricultural and sideline products that can be used as feed, it plans to store 1 million jin of corn stalks and 300,000 jin of sweet potato vines, as well as cut green grass, to achieve self-sufficiency in feed.

### 牲畜的“罐头”——青贮饲料

　　牲畜的“罐头”——青贮饲料
    河北省房山县石楼乡大次洛农业生产合作社，有大牲畜三百零三头，猪一千一百三十八口，羊一百七十五只。合作化之前，牲畜饲草一般都能自给自足，合作化以后由于缺乏对集体饲养牲畜的经验，产生了饲草不足的困难，牲畜因此瘦弱、死亡，影响了农业生产。
    1956年社里开展了一个青贮运动，一共贮备了玉米秸、白薯秧八十多万斤，相当于十六万斤干谷草（五斤折一斤谷草）。这不仅节省了社里大批资金，而且在粮食饲料不足的情况下，使全部牲畜安全渡过冬季和春季，保证了春耕生产。该社副主任许玉和同志说：“如果没有青贮饲料，这四、五个月里不知有多少牲畜要死亡、瘦弱。”他还说：“就目前国家给牲畜的留粮标准不再增加的情况下，搭喂青贮饲料可以保住原膘。例如平常一匹马一天喂四斤料，喂青贮时给二斤料就能保持原膘。所以群众说青贮饲料是牲畜的“罐头”。
    青贮季节正是农忙时候，而且玉米秸青贮工作的时间性很强，所以事先一定要作好准备，到青贮时开展突击运动，这样在几天之内就可完成全年的储备。贮青饲料必须作到随割、随运、随铡、随入窖、随封好口，才能保证质量，否则容易变质、霉烂。在玉米未成熟之前，需将玉米棒以上的部分割下来青贮，这可以保持玉米秸丰富的营养，同时还能促使玉米早熟和使子粒饱满。由于北方冬天较冷，青贮物的水分大，所以出窖后容易冻结，所以在2月以后开始喂青饲料较好，当然畜圈设备好不致冻结的，什么时候喂都可以。
    这个社根据去年的经验教训，计划在今年开展一个声势浩大的打储青贮饲料运动，并准备把能做饲料用的农副产品，全部利用起来外，其中青贮玉米秸一百万斤，白薯秧三十万斤，另外还打青草，作到饲料自给自足。
