Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 23rd: Indonesian Parliamentarian Siauw Giok Tjhan said that China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam practice active democracy to cultivate high labor enthusiasm; while the United States practices "democracy" only to cultivate anti-communist sentiment.

Siauw Giok Tjhan returned to Jakarta the day before yesterday after accompanying Parliamentary Speaker Sartono on visits to the United States, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and China. Jakarta newspapers today published his impressions of the visits.

Siauw Giok Tjhan said that in China he saw that everyone had the opportunity to express their opinions and offer criticisms, but such criticism must be aimed at improving work and overcoming shortcomings. However, the "democracy" of the United States is only for cultivating anti-communist sentiment, rejecting everything from "communist countries." This is because the authorities in the United States do not believe that the system they practice is superior. They are afraid of people with different ideas coming to the United States to see for themselves.

He said that the China he saw this time had made a lot more progress than what he saw last year. He mentioned that when he was in Shanghai, he had talked with some national capitalists, and they all expressed their willingness to assist the motherland in socialist construction.

When talking about his impressions of visiting Vietnam, Siauw Giok Tjhan said that the Indonesian parliamentary delegation received a warm and enthusiastic welcome from the Vietnamese government and people. The Vietnamese people have high labor enthusiasm, and production and construction have greatly developed. Grain production has far exceeded the level before World War II. Previously, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam had to import rice from South Vietnam, but now it can export it.

　　中国的民主培养劳动热情
　　美国“民主”培养反共舆论
　　印度尼西亚议员萧玉灿谈见闻
    据新华社雅加达23日电　印度尼西亚国会议员萧玉灿说，中国和越南民主共和国实行积极的民主来培养高度的劳动热情；而美国实行“民主”，只是为了培养反共舆论。
    萧玉灿在随同国会议长沙多诺访问美国、越南民主共和国和中国之后，在前天回到雅加达。今天雅加达报纸发表了他的访问观感。
    萧玉灿说，他在中国看到人人都有机会发表意见，提出批评，但是这种批评必须以改进工作、克服缺点为目的。但是美国的“民主”只是为培养反共舆论，拒绝一切来自“共产主义国家”的东西。这是因为美国的当权者不相信自己所实行的制度是优越的。他们害怕在思想上和他们不同的人到美国去看看。
    他说，这次看到的中国比去年看到的又有了很多进步。他提到他在上海的时候，曾经同一些民族资本家谈话，他们都表示愿意协助祖国进行社会主义建设。
    在谈到访问越南的印象的时候，萧玉灿说，印度尼西亚国会访问团受到了越南政府和人民亲切热烈的欢迎。越南人民的劳动热情很高，生产建设有很大发展，粮食的产量已经远远超过第二次世界大战以前的水平，以前越南民主共和国要从南越输入大米，现在可以输出了。
