Title: Not a "Tailor"

What is the relationship between construction units and design units? Some say it's like the relationship between a person getting clothes made and a tailor. The construction unit is the "person getting clothes made," and the design unit is the "tailor."

The relationship between the person getting clothes made and the tailor is one of obedience. As far as the person getting clothes made is concerned, they have absolute freedom to wear whatever clothes they like, no matter how strange the style or how much fabric it uses. As far as the tailor is concerned, it is a matter of course to cut and sew according to the customer's wishes. Of course, a good tailor will also make suggestions on style, tailoring, etc.; but these are only suggestions, and they have no control over whether or not they are adopted.

However, construction units are different from "people getting clothes made." Every construction project is not paid for by the construction unit itself, but is invested by the state; it is not constructed according to the construction unit's own wishes, but according to the needs of the national economy and the state's plan. Therefore, construction units cannot build whatever they like based on personal preferences, but must strictly abide by state plans and relevant basic construction policies and regulations. Design units are also different from "tailors." Tailors must obey their customers, but design units have the right to raise objections to the existence, scale, standards, etc., of various construction projects based on national policies and regulations.

Therefore, it is clearly incorrect to compare the relationship between construction units and design units to that between a person getting clothes made and a tailor.

However, why use this analogy in the first place? In reality, it reflects the "I am the only one who matters" thinking of some construction units. In their view, it is a matter of course for design units to unconditionally obey them. The fact that waste in basic construction has not been completely eliminated to this day is a major obstacle.

Behind the "analogy" lies a rather serious ideological problem. It must be exposed and opposed in order to allow design personnel to fully play their supervisory role in implementing the policy of "building the country with diligence and thrift."

### 不是“裁缝”

    不是“裁缝”
    吴滤
    建设单位同设计单位是什么关系？有人说是穿衣服的人同裁缝的关系。建设单位是“穿衣服的人”，设计单位是“裁缝”。
    穿衣服的人同裁缝的关系，是一方服从另一方。对于穿衣服的人说来，爱穿什么样的衣服，那怕样式多么希奇古怪，多么费布，都有绝对的自由。对于裁缝说来，根据主顾的愿望剪裁和缝纫，乃是天经地义的事情。当然，好的裁缝也对式样、剪裁等等提出建议；但也只是建议而已，采纳与否，是做不了主的。
    建设单位却不同于“穿衣服的人”。每一项建筑工程都不是建设单位自己花钱，而是国家投资的；都不是按照建设单位自己的愿望建设，而是根据国民经济的需要，根据国家的计划建设的。因而建设单位对于建设什么样的工程，不能凭个人爱好，想怎样便怎样，而是必须严守国家计划和有关基本建设的政策法令。设计单位也不同于“裁缝”。裁缝要服从主顾，设计单位却有权根据国家的政策法令，对各个工程项目的存废，规模大小、标准高低等等提出异议。
    因此，把建设单位和设计单位的关系比作穿衣服的和裁缝的关系，显然是不正确的。
    然而，为什么偏偏要拿来作譬喻呢？这里，实际上是反映了一些建设单位“唯我独尊”的思想。在他们看来，设计单位无条件地服从自己，乃是天经地义的事情。基本建设中的浪费至今没有反干净，这是一个重要的障碍物。
    “譬喻”的背后，隐藏着相当严重的思想问题。必须把它揭开来，反对掉，这才能使设计人员在贯彻“勤俭建国”的方针上充分发挥监督作用。
