    Nanchang, August 5th (report from our newspaper) - In order to ensure the smooth progress of the upcoming grain procurement work, the Secretariat of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a meeting on the 2nd. It was decided that before the autumn harvest, a campaign of propaganda and education on the national grain purchase and supply policy would be carried out among the province's farmers. This is intended to educate the peasant masses to correctly understand the grain issue and complete this year's grain procurement tasks.

    The meeting analyzed the current situation: The purpose of the right-wing elements in opposing the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain is to provoke discord between workers and peasants and between urban and rural areas, in an attempt to restore the capitalist free grain market. Some well-to-do middle peasants demand excessively high grain retention, unwilling to sell surplus grain and extra agricultural products to the state. Dominated by this capitalist thinking, some well-to-do middle peasants even collude with urban merchants in grain speculation, resulting in some areas that could have completed the agricultural product purchase tasks failing to fulfill the state's purchase plan this year. In addition, speculative and profiteering activities involving grain and other unified purchase materials flowing into the black market have been discovered in various places.

    The meeting pointed out that in this propaganda and education campaign, in addition to exposing to the peasant masses the reactionary essence of the current right-wing elements' opposition to the unified purchase and sale of grain, the capitalist thinking of some peasants who only care about personal interests and disregard the state's excessively high demand for grain retention, and the erroneous practice of collectives concealing output, should be criticized and educated. The correct relationship between improving life and developing production should be explained to them, advocating thrift and opposing the waste of grain; illegal activities of a few people using unified purchase materials for speculation and profiteering should be struggled against; and the counter-reckoning activities of some lawless landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries should be resolutely countered. The meeting believed that before carrying out this campaign, it is necessary to first unify ideological understanding among cadres, and criticize the right-leaning thoughts and departmentalism of some cadres who blindly shout about the grain issue.

    The meeting also believed that while carrying out socialist ideological education, it is necessary to closely integrate it with current production, mobilize and organize the peasant masses to continue to work hard in drought resistance, drought prevention, rush harvesting, and rush planting, and strive for a bumper autumn harvest.

### 江西确定宣传国家粮食政策  不许资本主义自由市场复活

    江西确定宣传国家粮食政策
    不许资本主义自由市场复活
    本报南昌5日电　为了使即将开始的粮食征购工作顺利进行，中共江西省委书记处2日举行会议，确定秋收以前向全省农民进行一次关于粮食统购统销政策的宣传教育运动，以教育农民群众正确认识粮食问题，完成今年粮食征购任务。
    会议分析了当前情况：右派分子反对粮食统购统销政策的目的，是挑拨工农关系和城乡关系，企图恢复资本主义的粮食自由市场。部分富裕中农要求过高地留粮，不想把余粮和多余的农产品卖给国家。在这种资本主义思想支配下，有些富裕中农甚至勾结城市商人进行粮食投机，致使今年有些可能完成农产品收购任务的地区，也没有完成国家收购计划。另外，各地都发现有粮食及其他统购物资流入黑市的投机倒把活动。
    会议指出：在这次宣传教育运动中，除了要向农民群众揭露目前右派分子反对粮食统购统销政策的反动本质外，对部分农民只顾个人、不顾国家过高要求留粮的资本主义思想和集体隐瞒产量的错误做法，应当进行批判教育，向他们讲明改善生活和发展生产的正确关系，提倡节约和反对浪费粮食；对少数人用统购物资进行投机倒把的违法活动，要进行斗争；对有些不法地主、富农和反革命分子的倒算活动，要坚决予以回击。会议认为，在开展这项运动以前，首先要在干部中统一思想认识，批评某些干部在粮食问题上盲目叫唤的右倾思想和本位主义思想。
    会议还认为，在进行社会主义思想教育时，应该密切结合当前生产，发动和组织农民群众继续努力做好抗旱、防旱、抢收、抢种工作，力争秋季丰收。
