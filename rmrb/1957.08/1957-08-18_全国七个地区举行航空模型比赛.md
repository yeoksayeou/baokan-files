    National Aeromodelling Competitions Held in Seven Regions
    (Our report) The 1957 National Aeromodelling Competition is currently being held in seven regions. The Beijing competition area also held an opening ceremony yesterday in Changxindian.
    Aeromodelling activities can not only increase young people's knowledge of aerodynamics, mechanics, meteorology, etc., but also cultivate their good qualities of courage, strength, resourcefulness, and flexibility, thereby cultivating reserve forces for the country's aviation industry. The six regions of Shenyang, Nanjing, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Xi'an, and Chengdu have all started their competitions successively since August 10th. More than 1,000 young athletes are participating in this competition. The competition events include five types: second- and third-level rubber band model airplanes, second- and third-level towline model airplanes, and first-level free flight model airplanes.
    Since liberation, aeromodelling sports have been launched in 104 cities in our country. According to incomplete statistics, more than 40,000 college and middle school students have participated in this activity. In 1956, our country sent a delegation to Budapest, Hungary, to participate in the international aeromodelling competition of democratic countries, and won two third places in towline model airplanes and free flight model airplanes, and fourth place in stunt performance. This national competition further demonstrates the rapid development of this sport.

    全国七个地区举行航空模型比赛
    本报讯  1957年全国航空模型比赛，现正在七个地区分别举行。北京竞赛区，昨天也在长辛店举行了开幕典礼。
    航空模型活动，不仅可以增进青少年空气动力学、力学、气象学等知识，而且还能锻炼他们勇敢、坚强、机智和灵活的良好品质，从而为国家的航空事业培养后备力量。沈阳、南京、武汉、广州、西安和成都的六个地区，都已从8月10日起，先后举行了比赛。参加这次比赛的共计有一千多名青少年运动员。比赛的项目有二、三级橡筋模型飞机，二、三级牵引模型飞机和一级自由飞模型飞机等五种。
    解放后，我国一百零四个城市开展了航空模型运动，据不完全的统计，参加这项活动的已有四万多名大、中学生。1956年我国派代表队到匈牙利布达佩斯参加民主国家国际航空模型比赛，获得了牵引模型飞机和自由飞模型飞机等两个第三名，特技表演第四名。这次全国性的比赛，更显示了这项运动的飞速发展。
