According to incomplete statistics, the party received more than 1,250,000 votes in the West Java county and city local council elections, exceeding its vote total (more than 820,000 votes) in the 1955 Constitutional Assembly election by 50%.

From the absolute number of votes obtained in this election in West Java, the Masyumi Party, as in the previous general election, still ranks first, with a total of more than 1,640,000 votes. The Nationalist Party has fallen from second to third place, and the fourth place is the Nahdlatul Ulama. The number of votes obtained by these three parties has decreased compared to the Constitutional Assembly election. Currently, the vote totals for two counties in West Java Province are still missing.

The total number of votes obtained by the Indonesian Communist Party in the local council elections in the Java provinces has reached 6,380,000. According to the party's previous estimates, it can obtain 6 million votes in the Java provinces and become the largest party in Java.

    西爪哇地方议会选举大局已定
　　印度尼西亚共产党占第二位
    据新华社雅加达29日电　据雅加达“人民日报”今天报道，印度尼西亚共产党在西爪哇省的地方议会选举中又得到很大的胜利。据不完全统计，这个党在西爪哇的县市地方议会选举中得到了一百二十五万多票，超过1955年制宪议会选举时它的得票数字（八十二万多票）的50％。
    从西爪哇这次选举得票的绝对数字看来，马斯友美党和上次普选时一样仍然占第一位，它一共得到一百六十四万多票。国民党已经从第二位退居第三位，第四位是伊斯兰教师联合会。这三个党得票数字都比制宪议会选举时减少。目前西爪哇省还缺两个县的选票数字。
    印度尼西亚共产党在爪哇各省地方议会选举中的得票总数已经有六百三十八万票。据这个党以前的估计，它可以在爪哇各省得到六百万票而成为爪哇的第一大党。
    据新华社雅加达30日电　印度尼西亚共产党北苏拉威西委员会28日发表声明，强烈抗议同中央对立的北苏拉威西军事当局大规模逮捕印度尼西亚共产党人和民主人士。
    声明表示希望政府迅速采取纠正措施。
    目前在北苏拉威西被捕的有印度尼西亚共产党北苏拉威西委员会书记和其他一些地区的党委员会书记以及当地一些妇女、青年和农民组织的领袖。属于印度尼西亚国民党的米那哈沙地方议会议长和另一个议员也被捕。
