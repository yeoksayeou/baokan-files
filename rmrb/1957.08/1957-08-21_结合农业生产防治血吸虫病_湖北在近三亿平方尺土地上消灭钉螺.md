　　Combining Agricultural Production with Schistosomiasis Prevention
　  Hubei Eliminates Snails on Nearly 300 Million Square Feet of Land
    (Our report) Hubei Province has done a very good job in preventing and controlling schistosomiasis. The province has treated more than 43,400 patients and carried out the work of eliminating the host of schistosomiasis—snails—on an area of 295 million square feet. Two basically snail-free counties and thirty-five basically snail-free townships have emerged. Some areas have implemented methods of managing manure to kill eggs, personal protection, and safe water use. In Huanggang Prefecture alone, twelve townships and seventy-six cooperatives have done a good job in managing manure and eliminating snails; Guangji County has 157 cooperatives that have adopted the method of using well water or dividing ponds for water use; Xin Zhou, Qichun, Yangxin and other counties have actively taken personal protection measures for large-scale agricultural activities such as cutting lake grass and fishing for fry.
    The work of preventing and controlling schistosomiasis in various parts of Hubei Province is closely integrated with agricultural production activities. For example, of the 227,000 mu of snail eradication area in Jingzhou Prefecture, more than 53,000 mu were carried out in conjunction with land reclamation, and the rest were mostly carried out in conjunction with water conservancy construction and sod removal for fertilizer accumulation.
    85% to 90% of the treated patients have improved their labor force to varying degrees. Many patients, especially those in the late stage, used to be households in difficulty who depended on relief for their livelihoods. After treatment, they have become self-reliant laborers. For example, in Xianfeng Third Cooperative, Mapu Township, Xinzhou County, 54 households used to be households in difficulty due to schistosomiasis. After treatment, they were all able to participate in labor, of which 12 households could be upgraded to surplus grain households, and 41 households could be upgraded to sufficient grain households.
    At present, meetings are being held in various places to summarize the prevention and control work in the first half of the year, in order to further educate cadres and the masses, and strive to make greater achievements in the second half of the year.

### 结合农业生产防治血吸虫病  湖北在近三亿平方尺土地上消灭钉螺

　　结合农业生产防治血吸虫病
　  湖北在近三亿平方尺土地上消灭钉螺
    本报讯　湖北省防治血吸虫病工作做得很好。全省治疗了四万三千四百多个病人，在两亿九千五百万平方尺的面积上进行了消灭血吸虫的宿主——钉螺的工作，出现了两个基本无螺县和三十五个基本无螺乡。部分地区已实行了管粪灭卵、个人防护和安全用水的办法，仅黄冈专区就有十二个乡七十六个合作社作好了管粪灭螺工作；广济县就有一百五十七个合作社采取用井水或分塘用水的办法；新洲、蕲春、阳新等县对打湖草、捞鱼苗等大规模的农事活动，都积极采取了个人防护的措施。
    湖北省各地开展防治血吸虫病的工作是紧密结合农业生产活动进行的，如荆州专区灭螺面积二十二万七千亩中，有五万三千多亩是结合开荒进行的，其余也大都是结合兴修水利和铲草皮积肥进行的。
    经过治疗的病人，有85％到90％都在不同程度上提高了劳动力。不少病人特别是晚期病人，过去是依靠救济过活的困难户，经过治疗以后，已经变成自食其力的劳动者了。如新洲县马铺乡先锋三社，过去有五十四户因患血吸虫病而成为困难户，经过治疗以后，都能够参加劳动了，其中有十二户可上升为余粮户，有四十一户可上升为足粮户。
    目前，各地正陆续召开会议，总结上半年的防治工作，以便进一步教育干部和群众，争取在下半年做出更大成绩。
