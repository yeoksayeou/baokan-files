Xinhua News Agency, 15th. An official from the General Logistics Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army told Xinhua reporters today that since the beginning of this year, all units of the People's Liberation Army have made great achievements in saving grain and fodder. It is estimated that the entire army can save 30 million jin of grain and 40 million jin of coarse grains used to feed military horses throughout the year.

This summer, the General Logistics Department sent personnel to inspect the grain saving situation of troops in eleven regions including Fujian, Guangdong, Yunnan, and Beijing. They found that this year, the troops are more serious and stricter in saving grain than last year, and the achievements made are also better. According to incomplete statistics, the army saved 12 million jin of grain last year; and this year, the amount of grain saved in the first half of the year alone has exceeded the total figure for last year.

Troops all over the country have used many methods to implement grain conservation. Many catering units have modified their stoves and adopted cooking methods such as "steaming rice with raw rice" and "sprinkling rice with boiling water," which can produce more rice, not form pot crusts, or form fewer pot crusts, and use pot crusts to make porridge. Cooks improve rice washing methods to avoid spilling a single grain of rice as much as possible.

Many troops have strengthened the management of military grain and food. It is stipulated that family members coming to the team must bring grain coupons, and the grain supply for family members of officers is completely in accordance with the supply standards for residents. All units strictly weigh rice and cook according to the number of people eating, so that there is no leftover rice, or less leftover rice.

Some troops have done a better job in sideline production than in the past. In addition to raising pigs and growing vegetables, they also grow sweet potatoes, potatoes, and corn as supplementary food to reduce the supply of military grain.

Troops in Inner Mongolia and other grassland areas also drive military horses to graze on the grassland, and it is expected that they will not need to feed horse feed for at least four months.

Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 15th. At present, saving grain has become a common practice in all agencies, troops, and hospitals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Fujian Front. According to statistics for the first four months of this year, the rice and flour saved by various units has reached more than 1.64 million jin. A certain air force unit has saved more than 25,000 jin of grain from January to the present.

In the work of saving grain, cooks are constantly improving their working methods to reduce grain consumption. They are careful and cautious when washing rice, and do not throw away a single grain of rice. When eating noodles, they try to pour out the flour in the flour bags as cleanly as possible. Cooks of a certain air force unit also crush the pot crusts and mix them into the flour to steam steamed buns and cook porridge.

In addition, all units strictly limit the grain consumption of family members and nannies accompanying the army in accordance with national standards and urge them to save grain.

    解放军今年可节约粮食三千万斤
    全军并可节约四千万斤军马饲料
    新华社15日讯  中国人民解放军总后勤部有关方面负责人今天对新华社记者说，今年以来，人民解放军各部队在节约粮食和饲料方面取得了很大的成绩，预计全年全军可节约三千万斤粮食和四千万斤饲养军马用的杂粮。
    今年夏季，总后勤部派出人员检查了福建、广东、云南、北京等十一个地区部队节约粮食的情况，发现今年部队在节约粮食方面，比去年更认真、更严格，做出的成绩也更好。据不完全统计，去年全军节约粮食一千二百万斤；而今年，仅上半年节约的粮食，就已超过了去年全年的数字。
    全国各地部队在贯彻粮食节约方面，使用了许多方法。许多伙食单位修改炉灶，采用了“生米蒸饭法”、“开水撒米”等等做饭方法，能够多出饭，不结锅巴，或少结锅巴，用锅巴作稀饭。炊事员改进淘米方法，尽量做到不撒掉一粒米。
    许多部队都加强了军粮和伙食的管理。规定来队家属一定要带粮票，军官家属的粮食供应，完全按照居民的供应标准。各个单位都严格按照吃饭人数称米做饭，做到不剩饭，或少剩饭。
    有些部队的副业生产比过去搞得更好，除了养猪、种菜以外，还种一些蕃薯、马铃薯和玉蜀黍等，做为辅助食粮，减少军粮的供应。
    内蒙古和其他驻草原地区的部队还把军马赶到草地上放牧，预计至少四个月可以不喂马料。
    据新华社福建前线15日电  目前，节约粮食已在福建前线中国人民解放军各机关、部队、医院中形成风气。据今年头四个月的统计，各部队节省下来的大米和面粉已达一百六十四万多斤。空军某部从1月到现在，节约粮食达二万五千多斤。
    在节约粮食工作中，炊事人员不断改进工作方法，减少粮食的消耗。他们淘米时谨慎小心，不抛撒一粒米，吃面时，尽量把面粉袋里的面粉倒干净。空军某部炊事员还把锅巴弄碎掺到面粉里蒸馒头，煮稀饭。
    此外，各单位还按国家规定的标准，严格限制随军家属、保姆的粮食消费，督促她们节约粮食。
