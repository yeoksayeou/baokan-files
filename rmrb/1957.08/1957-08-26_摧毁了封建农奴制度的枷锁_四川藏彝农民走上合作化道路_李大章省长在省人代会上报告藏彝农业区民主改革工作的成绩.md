Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, August 25th: "To date, democratic reforms have been completed in agricultural areas inhabited by 1,520,000 people in Tibetan and Yi regions of Sichuan Province, accounting for over 80% of the 1,900,000 people in agricultural areas of Tibetan and Yi regions throughout the province. It is expected that this winter and spring, with the exception of about 100,000 people in six counties of the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, the reform work for the remaining 1,800,000 people in Tibetan and Yi agricultural areas will be victoriously completed." This was mentioned by Sichuan Province Governor Li Dazhang in his government work report to the Fifth Session of the First Sichuan Provincial People's Congress, which opened on the 21st.

Li Dazhang pointed out: In the areas where democratic reforms have been completed, the cruel feudal and slave system has been destroyed, and the vast majority of serfs and slaves have gained personal freedom, greatly liberating rural productive forces. The working people are overjoyed, their enthusiasm for production is extremely high, and the rural landscape has been completely renewed. In these areas, in addition to the widespread establishment of mutual aid groups, agricultural production cooperatives have also been established on a trial basis, focusing on key areas, based on the demands of the masses and the strength of cadres, while taking into account ethnic characteristics. Currently, the proportion of farming households participating in cooperatives in the agricultural areas of the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture has reached over 30% of the total number of farming households. According to statistics from Kangding, Danba, and Daofu counties in the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, the proportion of farming households participating in cooperatives accounts for 13% of the total number of farming households, and in the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, the proportion is 18.5%. In the ethnic minority areas of the Xichang Special District, the proportion of farming households participating in cooperatives has also reached 10% of the total. Production in these areas has significantly increased. Although some areas of the Aba and Liangshan Autonomous Prefectures suffered relatively severe disasters last year, they still experienced varying degrees of increased production. The reform area of Liangshan achieved its first bumper harvest after liberation, with a 10% increase in production. The Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture increased grain production by 2 million jin compared to 1955. The increase in production in cooperatives was even more significant, generally increasing by 20%-30%, with the highest increase reaching 60%.

Li Dazhang pointed out: Over the past year or more, the democratic reforms in the Tibetan and Yi regions of Sichuan Province have been carried out under the leadership of the Party and the government, with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, through peaceful consultation, adopting a moderate approach, and mainly by the broad masses of ethnic minority laborers and their own ethnic cadres, based on the urgent demands of the broad masses of Tibetan and Yi people. Through democratic reforms, a large number of activists and outstanding cadres have emerged. According to statistics from the three autonomous prefectures of Aba, Ganzi, and Liangshan, the number of ethnic cadres absorbed in the democratic reforms reached 5,071. In the reform process and after the reform, representatives of the upper strata in various fields have been properly resettled and cared for politically and in their daily lives. Currently, the three autonomous prefectures and the Xichang Special District have resettled and cared for 6,861 representatives of the upper strata in various fields politically and in their daily lives.

Li Dazhang said that with the impending victorious completion of democratic reforms in the agricultural areas of Tibetan and Yi regions of Sichuan Province, our tasks in ethnic work in the future, in addition to continuing to complete the democratic reform work in the area of about 100,000 people in the southern part of the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture this winter and spring, we must continue to carry out in-depth make-up work to mobilize the masses in the areas where reforms have been completed, truly establishing the superiority of the basic masses; at the same time, the sabotage activities of those lawless slave owners and feudal lords must be resolutely cracked down upon in order to further consolidate the reform achievements. In all areas where reforms have been completed, leaders at all levels should shift their focus to production, delve deeply into the production situation in ethnic minority areas, systematically summarize experiences, adhere to the principle of "active leadership, steady progress" based on ethnic characteristics and objective conditions, gradually develop the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and carry out the socialist transformation of agriculture; strengthen the construction of political power in ethnic minority areas, further realize the autonomous rights of autonomous organs; vigorously cultivate and improve ethnic cadres, gradually achieving ethnicization; strengthen the united front work among the upper strata, and continue to constantly criticize and overcome Han chauvinism and local nationalism; strengthen leadership and support for ethnic minority areas in various aspects such as finance, trade, transportation, culture, education, and health; and at the same time, pay attention to strengthening the leadership of pastoral areas and actively adopt various measures to develop animal husbandry production.

Li Dazhang said that the above-mentioned facts are the most powerful refutation of the fallacies of those right-wing elements who say that "the reform work in ethnic minority areas has gone wrong" and that "reform is the oppression of ethnic minorities by the Han people."

　　摧毁了封建农奴制度的枷锁
　　四川藏彝农民走上合作化道路
　　李大章省长在省人代会上报告藏彝农业区民主改革工作的成绩
    新华社成都25日电　“到目前为止，四川省藏、彝族地区的农业区内已经有一百五十二万人口的地区完成了民主改革，完成改革的地区占全省藏、彝族地区农业区一百九十万人口的80％以上。预计今冬明春，除甘孜藏族自治州有六个县约十万人口的地区外，其余藏、彝族农业区一百八十万人口的改革工作即将全部胜利完成。”这是四川省省长李大章在21日开幕的四川省第一届人民代表大会第五次会议上向全体代表所作政府工作报告中提到的。
    李大章指出：在完成了民主改革的地区，由于摧毁了残酷的封建。奴隶制度，广大的农奴和奴隶获得了人身自由，大大解放了农村生产力，劳动人民欢天喜地，生产情绪十分高涨，农村面貌完全一新。在这些地区除普遍建立了互助组外，根据群众要求和干部力量，在照顾民族特点的原则下，还重点试办了农业生产合作社。现在，阿坝藏族自治州农业区入社农户已占总农户的30％以上，甘孜藏族自治州康定、丹巴、道孚三县统计入社农户占总农户的13％，凉山彝族自治州入社农户占总农户的18.5％。西昌专区少数民族地区入社农户也达到总农户10％。这些地区的生产有了显著提高。阿坝、凉山两个自治州的部分地区去年虽然遭到较严重的灾害，但仍然不同程度地增了产。凉山改革地区获得了解放后第一个丰收，增产10％。阿坝藏族自治州较1955年增产原粮二百万斤。合作社的增产更为显著，一般增产20％—30％，最高的增产达60％。
    李大章指出：一年多来，四川省藏、彝族地区的民主改革是根据广大藏、彝族人民的迫切要求，在党和政府的领导下，在人民解放军的大力支援下，经过和平协商，采取和缓方式，并且主要是由广大少数民族劳动群众和他们自己的本民族干部来进行的。通过民主改革，涌现了大批积极分子和优秀干部，据阿坝、甘孜、凉山三个自治州统计，在民主改革中吸收的民族干部达五千零七十一人。在改革中和改革后各方面的上层代表人士在政治上和生活上均予以妥善的安置和照顾。现在三个自治州及西昌专区在政治上和生活上对各方面的上层代表人士予以安置和照顾的共六千八百六十一人。
    李大章说，随着四川省藏、彝族地区农业区民主改革即将全部胜利完成，今后我们在民族工作上的任务，除今冬明春继续完成除甘孜藏族自治州南部约十万人口地区的民主改革工作外，对已完成改革的地区，必须继续深入地进行发动群众的补课工作，真正树立基本群众的优势；同时对那些不法奴隶主、封建主的破坏活动必须予以坚决的打击，以进一步巩固改革成果。在一切完成改革的地区，各级领导均应转向生产，深入地钻研民族地区的生产情况，系统地总结经验，根据民族特点和主客观条件，坚持“积极领导，稳步前进”的原则，逐步发展互助合作运动，进行农业的社会主义改造；加强民族地区的政权建设，进一步实现自治机关的自治权利；大力培养和提高民族干部，逐渐实现民族化；加强上层统战工作，继续不断地批判和克服大汉族主义和地方民族主义；加强在财经贸易、交通运输和文教卫生等各方面对民族地区的领导和支援；同时并注意加强牧区工作的领导，积极地采取各种措施，发展牧业生产。
    李大章说，对于那些别具用心的右派分子说什么“民族地区的改革工作搞错了”，“改革是汉族压迫少数民族”等谬论，上述事实就是一个最有力的回击。
