Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, August 13th: The Jiangsu Provincial Working Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce recently jointly held a symposium in Nanjing with representatives of industrialists and businessmen from twenty-nine cities and counties across the province, to thoroughly expose and criticize Qian Sunqing, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, and a rightist.

During the "Great Blooming and Contending," Qian Sunqing frantically incited the industrial and commercial circles to attack the Party, saying things like "Democratic parties emphasize obeying the leadership of the Communist Party, this is dogmatism," and "Emphasizing the transformation of the bourgeoisie makes people lose their self-esteem." He incited small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen to demand great democracy, and presumptuously claimed that he would clean up the mess. He proposed that the public side withdraw from the joint state-private enterprises, to be led by the private side, to compete with joint ventures that had public representatives.

The poison spread by Qian Sunqing and Zhang Naiqi had already led to the rightward turn of industrialists and businessmen in some regions and industries in Jiangsu Province. Many students in political schools for industry and commerce in Jiangsu Province and various cities were unwilling to accept the correct principle of socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce; Qian Zhonghan, Qian Sunqing's son and Standing Committee Member of the Wuxi City Federation of Industry and Commerce, attempted to return the Shenxin Textile Factory, which had been jointly operated for three years, to the capitalist road, transferring management to the private side. Fourteen private personnel in the textile industry in Wuxi jointly spoke at the Municipal People's Congress, attacking the Communist Party's leadership over joint ventures. Rightists in Taizhou also arrogantly wanted to squeeze out the Communist Party cadres in the Federation of Industry and Commerce. Now, this symposium is focusing on irreconcilable reasoning struggles against Qian Sunqing's anti-Communist Party and anti-socialist fallacies, pointing out that the emergence of these reactionary words and deeds in various places precisely illustrates the urgent need for the bourgeoisie to further change its political stance. Tong Qingao, an Executive Committee Member of the Suzhou City Federation of Industry and Commerce, said deeply: "The exploitative consciousness deep in our minds cannot be overcome all at once after the enterprise is jointly operated with fanfare. If emphasizing transformation means losing self-esteem, then it will only lose the shameful self-esteem of the exploiting class, what's wrong with that?" Zhang Yunxi, a Standing Committee Member of the Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, exposed Qian Sunqing's conspiracy, saying that Qian Sunqing has consistently opposed the Party and socialism in both principle and specific issues. His verbal "support" and "acknowledgment" were only to obtain legal status, making it easier for him to carry out his sabotage activities. The materials revealed in the conference in the past few days have also proven this to be the case: Qian Sunqing verbally supported the land reform, but in action, he shouted "There is no feudalism in Jiangnan, no landlords in Jiangnan"; Qian Sunqing superficially supported the anti-rebellion movement, but secretly shielded Qian Fenghao, a major traitor in Wuxi; Qian Sunqing supported the Five-Anti movement, but everywhere complained on behalf of Zhao Zhangji, a venal merchant in Wuxi who was guilty of all five vices; Qian Sunqing agreed to the state monopoly of purchase and marketing, but at the same time spread rumors saying "People are starving to death in the countryside"; Qian Sunqing also said that industrialists and businessmen should love the country and abide by the law, but also clamored "Officials have laws, but the people have no laws," and there is no law to abide by. He said that the Communist Party formulated a constitution, but it was discarded as soon as a movement came, in order to denigrate various political movements.

The industrial and commercial circles throughout Jiangsu Province have expressed extreme concern and support for this socialist great debate. Since the conference began on August 7, Xinhua Daily has continuously published editorials criticizing Qian Sunqing's fallacies, and has published conference news and articles by participants in the debate in large format every day.

### 把工商业者引回老路是痴心妄想  钱孙卿的引魂幡被烧掉了

    把工商业者引回老路是痴心妄想
    钱孙卿的引魂幡被烧掉了
    新华社南京13日电　民主建国会江苏省工作委员会和江苏省工商业联合会最近在南京联合召开全省二十九个市、县工商业者代表座谈会，对省工商联主任委员、右派分子钱孙卿进行深入的揭发和批判。
    在“大鸣大放”期间，钱孙卿疯狂地煽动工商界向党进攻，说什么“民主党派强调服从共产党的领导，这就是教条主义”、“强调资产阶级改造，使人丧失自尊心”。他煽动中小工商业者闹大民主，并妄称要由他来收拾残局。他提出要公方退出公私合营工厂，由私方领导，与有公方代表的合营工厂进行竞争。
    钱孙卿和章乃器所散布的毒素，已经导致江苏省某些地区和行业的工商业者向右转。江苏省及各市工商界政治学校的学员，有不少人不愿接受关于资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的正确道理；钱孙卿的儿子无锡市工商联常务委员钱钟汗，企图使合营三年的申新纺织工厂重回资本主义道路，移交私方经营。无锡市纺织业中有十四个私方人员在市人民代表大会上联名发言攻击共产党对合营企业的领导。泰州市右派分子也狂妄地要把工商联中的共产党员干部排挤出去。现在，这个座谈会正集中向钱孙卿的这种反共产党反社会主义的谬论进行不调和的说理斗争，指出各地所以出现这些反动言行，正说明资产阶级迫切需要进一步改变政治立场。苏州市工商联执行委员童勤高深切地说：“我们思想深处的剥削意识，不可能在企业敲锣打鼓合营后就一下子克服了。如果说强调改造就是丧失自尊心的话，那也只会丧失可耻的剥削阶级自尊心，这有什么不好？”江苏省工商联常委张允溪揭露钱孙卿的阴谋说，钱孙卿不论在原则与具体问题上都一贯地反党反社会主义。他在口头上的“拥护”、“承认”，只是为了取得合法地位，更便于他的破坏活动。大会几天中已揭发的材料也证明的确如此：钱孙卿口头上拥护土地改革，在行动上却大喊“江南无封建、江南无地主”；钱孙卿表面上赞成肃反运动，暗地里却包庇无锡大汉奸钱凤皋；钱孙卿拥护五反运动，却为无锡五毒俱全的奸商赵章吉到处喊冤；钱孙卿一面同意统购统销，一面又造谣说“农村饿死人了”；钱孙卿也说工商业者应当爱国守法，但又叫嚣“官有法，民无法”，无法可守。他说什么共产党制定了宪法，可是运动一来就丢了，以此来诋毁各种政治运动。
    江苏全省工商界对这次社会主义大辩论，表示极其关怀和支持。从8月7日大会开始以来，新华日报连续发表社论，批判钱孙卿的谬论，每天并以巨幅刊登大会新闻和参加辩论者的文章。
