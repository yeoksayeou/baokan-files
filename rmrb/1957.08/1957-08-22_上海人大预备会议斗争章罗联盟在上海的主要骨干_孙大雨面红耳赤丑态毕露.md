Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 21st (Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhang Jiachi): Sun Dayu, a key member of the Zhang-Luo alliance in Shanghai, has been refuted by representatives at the Shanghai Municipal People's Congress preparatory meeting in recent days, causing him to turn red in the face. On August 17, Sun Dayu made his first "self-criticism" to the representatives at the preparatory meeting, admitting that he was a "thorough rightist" and "committed crimes against the Party, against the people, and against socialism." However, he refused to explain his relationship with the Zhang-Luo alliance and continued to attack the Party and the people in this so-called "self-criticism."

Slanderously Accusing Party Cadres and Progressive Figures as Counter-Revolutionaries

Sun Dayu is a professor at Fudan University. In the anti-Party and anti-socialist activities of the Zhang-Luo alliance, he played a very deceptive and special role. Since liberation, he has consistently used a feigned madness and slanderous approach to falsely accuse and defame responsible Party cadres and non-Party progressive figures in cultural and educational departments as "counter-revolutionaries" on various occasions. On December 20th of last year, at the Municipal CPPCC meeting, he falsely accused Chen Qiwu, director of the Municipal Higher Education Bureau, Yang Xiguang, secretary of the Fudan University Party Committee, as well as professors Qi Qisheng, writer Zhang Jin, and more than 20 others as a "counter-revolutionary clique," and repeatedly submitted false accusation letters to Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou, and other central leaders. After the rectification campaign began, Sun Dayu became even more frantic. On June 6th, at a rectification symposium held by the Fudan University Party Committee, he again presented a large list of "counter-revolutionaries," saying that there were also "counter-revolutionary cliques" within the Jiefang Daily and Xinwen Daily. On July 3rd and 5th, he continued to expand the list, falsely accusing Minister of Justice Shi Liang and Shanghai Deputy Mayor Jin Zhonghua of being "counter-revolutionaries" as well. Shanghai Mayor Chen Yi and other Party and government leaders gave Sun Dayu several warnings regarding his rogue behavior of slanderous accusations, but he ignored them and instead became even more aggressive. To date, he has falsely accused more than 60 people of being "counter-revolutionaries."

Sun Dayu appeared extremely rampant when he frantically attacked the Communist Party during the Great Blooming and Letting Contend, proclaiming that "even if I fall and die, I will still participate in the rectification symposium." However, after the anti-Rightist struggle unfolded, Sun Dayu suddenly became "seriously ill." For two months, he hid in the 18-story building of Maoming Apartments, refusing to come out and explain his crimes, and daring not to attend the anti-Rightist debate meetings held at Fudan University. On August 15, when the Second Session of the Second Shanghai Municipal People's Congress opened, Sun Dayu again attempted to feign illness and request leave. After his unreasonable request was rejected, he had no choice but to put on a frail appearance, supporting himself with a cane in one hand and being helped by someone in the other to attend the meeting. Delegate Liu Dezhong exposed the trick of this Rightist element on the spot, reading out the results of a recent health examination conducted on Sun Dayu by the hospital: "Sun Dayu weighs 178 pounds, the internal medicine examination is normal, the X-ray fluoroscopy of the heart and lungs is normal, and the neurology examination is normal." The doctor's final conclusion for Sun Dayu was: "Can swim." Facing this robust, yet faltering, Rightist element who "can swim," the entire hall of representatives erupted in a burst of contemptuous laughter.

On August 17, Sun Dayu made his first "self-criticism" at the meeting, admitting that he was a thorough Rightist element on one hand, while on the other hand claiming that his crime of falsely accusing a large number of Party cadres and progressive figures of being "counter-revolutionaries" was due to his "absolute loyalty" to the Party and his "stubborn adherence to 'blind loyalty,'" resulting in "subjectivism" and "simplistic logic" in his thinking, and "regarding those whom the Party and government considered good people as counter-revolutionaries." He even said complacently that if this continued, he would become "a Don Quixote on the ideological front." Sun Dayu's "self-criticism" aroused great anger among the delegates present. Many delegates immediately exposed that Sun Dayu was still playing his trick of "I am revolutionary, and those who oppose me are all counter-revolutionaries" to attack the Party in his so-called self-criticism. Sun Dayu was also attempting to muddle through by using the logic of "you think they are good people, so I admit I was wrong," plotting a future counterattack.

Sun Dayu's false accusation of so many Communist Party members and progressive figures as "counter-revolutionaries" was not because he was a madman who couldn't distinguish right from wrong. According to the delegates' exposure at the preparatory meetings on August 17th and 19th, this was entirely a "tactic" used by the Zhang-Luo alliance to attack the Party and the people. The adoption of this "tactic" was an attempt to confuse right and wrong, create chaos, and undermine the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement and the Party's policy of uniting and transforming intellectuals, in order to achieve their conspiracy to harm Party cadres and non-Party progressive figures, and to realize their conspiracy to overthrow the Party's leadership. Delegate Qi Qisheng and others pointed out that the "blacklist" created by Sun Dayu was entirely a collective creation of the Shanghai Rightist group of the Zhang-Luo alliance, and Sun Dayu did not even know some of the people on these lists. According to the confession of Lu Yi, a key member of this Rightist group, he and other Rightist elements in the group, such as Wang Zaoshi, Peng Wenyin, and Zhang Mengwen, participated in this conspiracy. On the same night that Sun Dayu made his public false accusations at the Municipal CPPCC meeting last year, they held a meeting at Sun's home to discuss countermeasures until late at night. The delegates also revealed that when relevant departments prepared to investigate and handle Sun Dayu's false accusations, Rightist elements in this group supported Sun everywhere. Rightist elements Wang Zaoshi and Sun Siming sought legal basis for Sun Dayu, saying that capitalist countries all have parliamentary democracy, and speeches in parliament are "not legally responsible." Chen Zizhan, another member of this group, said to Sun: "If they want to cut off your, Sun Dayu's, head, I, Chen Zizhan, will put my head out first." The false accusation letter that Sun Dayu submitted to the central government was not only discussed in the Rightist group in Shanghai, but was also personally taken to Beijing to study with Luo Longji and Gu Zhizhong, and received their support.

Delegate Shen Tilan and others exposed with facts that as early as 1947, before liberation, Luo Longji instructed Sun Dayu to seize control of the "University Professors Association," which was led by the Communist Party's underground organization. Therefore, Sun and Peng Wenyin, Chen Renbing, and others proposed to reorganize the leadership of the "University Professors Association." However, their conspiracy did not succeed. In an election in the early days of liberation, Sun Dayu lost his position as acting chairman of the "University Professors Association," and from then on, he fabricated stories that Li Zhengwen, the Party leader in the "University Professors Association," and other progressive professors such as Zhang Jin and Qi Qisheng, were members of the Kuomintang CC clique's "official residence faction." After liberation, he continued to use this method to undermine ideological remolding and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, saying that "ideological remolding has made things worse," and that "the suppression of counter-revolutionaries is the suppression of revolutionaries," suppressing revolutionary elements. After the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique was uncovered, he spread rumors that "these people are all pretending to be progressive, and in the future, be careful of those who are full of Marxism-Leninism." After the Pan Hannian counter-revolutionary case was uncovered, Sun Dayu and this Rightist group believed that their opportunity had arrived. They jointly drafted a "counter-revolutionary" list, including a large number of Party cadres and progressive figures in the Pan Hannian clique, attempting to wipe them all out. On the other hand, in October 1955, soon after the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement began at Fudan University, Sun Dayu lied that he had been wrongly accused of being a counter-revolutionary, claimed to be "ill," and stopped coming to the school to teach. For two years, he took 11,000 yuan from the state (monthly salary of 302.5 yuan, housing subsidy of 160 yuan), but never taught a single class. According to the delegates, no one ever said he was a counter-revolutionary during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, but Sun Dayu had been pretending to be aggrieved for two years to gain sympathy, while on the other hand, he was more actively engaging in anti-communist and anti-people activities with members of the Rightist group.

After the Party's rectification movement began, Sun Dayu's "illness" suddenly improved. Not only did he make a slanderous speech of more than an hour at the rectification symposium held by the Fudan University Party Committee on June 6, but he also declared complacently at the professors' symposium the next day: "There is absolutely such a situation in China (referring to the Hungarian event), it just hasn't erupted." He also wrote an article to Wenhui Daily, demanding that the Party leaders in charge of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement in higher education be punished, and suggested that they be "isolated from life" and "make detailed written explanations." Sun Dayu's rampant attacks during this period coincided with the time when Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji were holding six professors' symposiums in Beijing,妄想妄想China to appear like the Hungarian incident, and when Luo Longji proposed the "rehabilitation committee." Sun Dayu's arguments and attack steps were completely consistent with those of Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji.

Boasted of Being a Progressive Professor, But Has Been a Reactionary Role for 27 Years

Sun Dayu has been boasting of being a "progressive professor" with "merit" in the revolution since liberation, but the delegates presented ample facts over the past two days proving that Sun Dayu has consistently been a reactionary role for 27 years. In 1930, Sun Dayu returned from studying in the United States and joined the New Moon Publishing House and the New Moon Poetry Journal, becoming a "poet" of the "New Moon School," attacking progressive writers such as Lu Xun along with Hu Shi, Luo Longji, Liang Shiqiu, and others. In 1942, Sun Dayu was introduced to teach at the Central Political School by Zhang Daofan, a Kuomintang cultural secret agent. In the same year, he was introduced to join the Kuomintang by Sun Ke and Liang Hancao. Later, he colluded with Zhou Jingxiong, a backbone of the CC clique and the director of the Higher Education Department of the puppet Ministry of Education, to run for puppet legislative member unsuccessfully, and then joined the China Democratic League in 1946 through Luo Longji's introduction. From then on, Sun Dayu became a loyal executor of Luo Longji's anti-communist and pro-American line. In 1947 and 1948, when Luo Longji was colluding with the United States, demanding American aid to realize his anti-communist political conspiracy, Sun Dayu and Peng Wenyin vigorously promoted Luo Longji's line in the "University Professors Association." Later, Sun Dayu personally drafted a memorandum in English to meet with Truman's aggressive envoy, Wedemeyer. Sun Dayu has been boasting that this shameful act of betraying the motherland was his anti-Chiang act in front of the Americans, which was a "contribution" to the revolution. After joining the China Democratic League and the progressive "University Professors Association," Sun Dayu continued to collude with reactionary figures such as Zhu Jiahua and Chen Xueping.

After liberation, Sun Dayu continued to adhere to his position of hatred for the Party and the revolution. He falsely accused that "the proletariat knows nothing, the Communist Party has no intellectuals, and it cannot lead the revolution or lead construction." He also falsely accused that there was no freedom in New China, saying that "democracy has been heard of after liberation, but freedom has not been heard of," and he even hated Party members and League members among students, deliberately lowering their scores during exams. Sun Dayu also spread slanderous remarks against the Soviet Union during teaching reform.

Writer Zhang Jin and others also exposed the true face of Sun Dayu's "poet" and "Shakespeare expert" at the meeting. It turned out that this "expert" had only translated one Shakespearean play, "King Lear," and Sun Dayu's so-called "poet" was a man who loved money like his life, and his soul was filled with the stench of money. After the anti-Rightist struggle, Fudan University sent people to ask him to confess several times, but he lay down pretending to be ill and refused to see anyone. However, when he heard that wages and royalties were being sent, he immediately got up. Recently, the Compilation Department of Fudan University used one of his manuscripts, and Sun Dayu insisted on the highest royalties and demanded that each page of manuscript paper be counted for 80 more characters. He wrote an article for Wenhui Daily and complained that the royalties were too low, arguing with Wenhui Daily to check the accounts to see if it was less than what others were given, and Wenhui Daily had to give him more money to settle the matter. Sun Dayu once falsely accused that the new society "has no feelings." According to the delegates, Sun Dayu himself was truly a "heartless" person. Once, Sun Dayu's mother asked him for some kerosene, and Sun Dayu actually said: "Pay first, then deliver the goods, otherwise I won't give it." A professor at Fudan University once borrowed one yuan from Sun Dayu to pay the China Democratic League dues, and the next day Sun Dayu sent him a postcard, asking him to immediately send the one yuan to the post office.

The People Let Him Live on the 18th Floor
He Wants to Trample the People Into the 18th Level of Hell

At the meetings on the 17th and 19th, worker representatives Wei Xuezhen, Wu Liangxian, Hu Weikang, and others carried out reasoned struggles against Sun Dayu's reactionary words and deeds. Wang Qifa, a worker representative from Shen Tai Textile Factory, said that Sun Dayu said that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries was "suppressing revolutionaries," proving that Sun Dayu was completely speaking from the position of a counter-revolutionary element. Wei Xuezhen, a female worker representative from Nanyang Tobacco Factory, and others refuted Sun Dayu's fallacies such as "the working class has no knowledge," "cannot lead the revolution," and "cannot lead construction." Wei Xuezhen said: In our factory, one car is produced by two and a half workers, and it can create 1.16 million yuan of wealth for the country every year, while two and a half workers only need 170 yuan per month. She questioned Sun Dayu: You take 462 yuan from the state every month, which can buy more than 3,000 kilograms of rice. You have taken more than 10,000 yuan in two years. What have you done for the people? Some representatives said: The people sent Sun Dayu to the 18th floor (the 18-story apartment where Sun Dayu lives is provided by the government to take care of senior intellectuals), but Sun Dayu wants to trample the Chinese people into the 18th level of hell, engaging in anti-communist, anti-socialist capitalist restoration conspiracies. Sun Dayu is completely an ungrateful person.

Under the representatives' solemn refutation, Sun Dayu turned red and lowered his head in silence. The representatives asked Sun Dayu to make an honest confession again.

　　上海人大预备会议斗争章罗联盟在上海的主要骨干
　　孙大雨面红耳赤丑态毕露
    新华社上海21日电　新华社记者张家炽报道：章、罗联盟在上海的主要骨干分子孙大雨，这几天在上海市人民代表大会预备会议上被代表们驳斥得面红耳赤。8月17日孙大雨在预备会议上向代表们作了第一次“检讨”，承认他是一个“十足的右派分子”，“犯了反党、反人民、反社会主义的罪”，但是他拒绝交代和章罗联盟的关系，并且在这个所谓“检讨”中继续向党、向人民进攻。
　　含血喷人，诬告党员干部和进步人士为反革命分子
    孙大雨是复旦大学教授。在章罗联盟的反党、反社会主义活动中，他担任着一个非常迷惑人的特殊的角色。解放以来，他一直以装疯卖傻、血口喷人的姿态在各种场合诬告、诽谤文教部门的党员负责干部和党外进步人士是“反革命分子”，去年12月20日他在市政协会议上诬告市高教局局长陈其五、中共复旦大学党委书记杨西光以及教授漆琪生、作家章靳以等二十多人为“反革命集团”，并且几次向毛主席、周总理等中央领导人提出诬告信。整风开始以后，孙大雨更加疯狂起来，6月6日，在中共复旦大学党委召开的整风座谈会上，他又提出大批“反革命”名单，说解放日报社和新闻日报社内部也有“反革命集团”。7月3日与5日，他继续扩大名单，诬指司法部部长史良和上海市副市长金仲华也是“反革命分子”。孙大雨这种血口喷人的无赖行为，上海市市长陈毅和其他党政领导人曾几次给予劝告，但他置之不理，反而变本加厉。到现在为止，被他诬指为“反革命分子”的已经达六十多人。
    孙大雨在大鸣大放中向共产党猖狂进攻时显得十分猖獗，他声称“就是摔死跌死也要来参加整风座谈会”。可是在反右派斗争展开后，孙大雨忽然“病重”了，两个月来他一直躲在茂名公寓十八层大厦里，拒绝出来交代他的罪行，也不敢出席复旦大学举行的反击右派分子辩论会。8月15日上海市第二届人民代表大会第二次会议开会，孙大雨还想再一次装病请假。他的无理要求被拒绝后，他才不得不装着一付弱不禁风的样子，一手支着手杖，一手由人扶着出席了会议。列席代表刘德中当场戳穿了这个右派分子的花招，他宣读了医院最近给孙大雨所作健康检查的结果：“孙大雨体重一百七十八斤，内科检查正常，X光透视心肺正常，神经科检查正常”。医生最后给孙大雨的结论是：“可以游泳”。面对着这个身躯壮硕、步履蹒跚而又“可以游泳”的右派分子，全场代表发出了一阵鄙视和轻蔑的笑声。
    8月17日孙大雨在会上作了第一次的“检讨”，一面承认自己是十足的右派分子，一面却把诬告大批党员干部和进步人士为“反革命”的罪行说成是因为对党“赤胆忠诚”，“死抱着‘愚忠’不放”，因而思想上“主观主义”、“逻辑简单”，“把党和政府认为好人的人当做了反革命分子”。他还洋洋得意地说：如果再此下去，就会成为“思想战线上的唐·吉诃德”。孙大雨的“检讨”引起了与会代表的极大愤怒。许多代表当场揭露，孙大雨在所谓检讨中，依然玩弄他的“我是革命的，反对我的都是反革命”的手法来向党进攻。孙大雨还应用“你们认为好人，所以我承认错了”的逻辑来蒙混过关，阴谋将来反攻。
    孙大雨诬告这么多共产党员和进步人士是“反革命”，并不是因为他是个黑白不分的疯子。据代表们在17日和19日两天的预备会议上揭露，这完全是章罗联盟向党、向人民进攻的一种“战术”。而采取这种“战术”，是企图混淆是非，制造混乱，破坏肃反运动和党对知识分子的团结改造政策，以达到他们陷害党的干部和党外进步人士，实现推翻党的领导的阴谋。代表漆琪生等指出，孙大雨制造的“黑名单”完全是章罗联盟上海右派集团的集体创作，这些名单中，有的人孙大雨根本不认识。据这个右派集团的骨干分子陆诒交代，他和集团中的右派分子王造时、彭文应、张孟闻等都参与了这个阴谋。去年孙大雨在市政协会议上作了公开诬告发言的当天晚上，他们就在孙的家中开会商议对策直到深夜。代表们还揭露，在有关部门准备调查处理孙大雨的诬告时，这个集团中的右派分子到处为孙撑腰。右派分子王造时、孙斯鸣替孙大雨找法律根据，说资本主义国家都有议会民主，议会上发言是“不负法律责任”的。这个集团的另一分子陈子展对孙说：“他们要砍你孙大雨的头，我陈子展的头先伸出来”。孙大雨向中央提出的诬告信不但在上海的右派集团中商讨过，而且还亲自带到北京与罗隆基、顾执中研究，并且得到他们的支持。
    代表沈体兰等以事实揭露，早在1947年解放前，罗隆基曾指示孙大雨要把受共产党地下组织领导的“大学教授联谊会”抓在手里。于是孙和彭文应、陈仁炳等提出要求改选“大教联”领导机构。但他们的阴谋并未成功。在解放初期的一次改选中，孙大雨失掉了“大教联”代理主席的职位，由此他便捏造“大教联”中党的负责人李正文及其他进步教授章靳以、漆琪生等为国民党CC系统的“公馆派”。解放以后，他继续不断地用这种手法来破坏思想改造和肃反运动，说“思想改造改糟了”，说“肃反是肃革”，肃了革命分子。在胡风反革命集团破获后，他又放出空气说“这些人都是装进步的，以后对满口马列主义的人要小心”。潘汉年反革命案破获后，孙大雨和这个右派集团认为机会到了，他们共同草拟了“反革命”名单，把一大批党的干部和进步人士列入潘汉年集团中去，企图把他们一网打尽。另一方面，孙大雨在1955年10月复旦大学肃反运动刚开始不久，就谎称被冤枉为反革命分子，称“病”不再来学校教书。两年来他拿了国家的一万一千元（每月工资三百零二元五角，房租津贴一百六十元），却从未教一堂课。据代表们揭露，在肃反运动中从未有人说他是反革命分子，可是孙大雨两年来一直装着受委屈的样子以取得别人的同情，另一方面却更加积极地和右派集团中的分子进行反共反人民的活动。
    在党的整风运动开始后，孙大雨的“病”忽然好了，他不但在6月6日中共复旦大学党委召开的整风座谈会上发表了长达一个多钟头的血口喷人的发言，而且还在第二天的教授座谈会上得意洋洋地宣称：“中国毫无问题有这样的情况（指匈牙利事件），只是没有爆发出来”。他还写文章给文汇报，要求处分领导高教部门肃反运动的党员负责人，并建议把他们“隔离开来生活”，“作书面详细交代”。孙大雨这一时期内的猖狂进攻，正是章伯钧、罗隆基在北京召开六教授座谈会，妄想中国出现匈牙利事件和罗隆基提出“平反委员会”的时候。孙大雨的论调和进攻步骤，跟章伯钧、罗隆基完全一致。
　　自吹是进步教授，二十七年来却一直是个反动角色
    孙大雨解放以来一直标榜自己是“进步教授”，对革命有“功”，但两天来代表们提出充分的事实证明，孙大雨二十七年来始终是一个反动角色。1930年孙大雨从美国留学回来，就参加了新月出版社和新月诗刊，成为“新月派”的“诗人”，与胡适、罗隆基、梁实秋等在一起，攻击鲁迅等进步作家。1942年，孙大雨由国民党文化特务张道藩介绍到中央政治学校教书。同年又由孙科、梁寒操介绍加入国民党。以后他勾结CC派骨干、伪教育部高等教育司司长周经熊活动伪立法委员未成，就在1946年经罗隆基介绍加入民盟。从此孙大雨便成为罗隆基反共亲美路线的忠实执行人。在1947年和1948年，正当罗隆基勾搭美国，要求美国给他美援来实现他的反共政治阴谋时，孙大雨、彭文应就在“大教联”中竭力宣扬罗隆基的路线，后来孙大雨亲自草拟一份英文的备忘录去见杜鲁门的侵略特使魏德迈。这一出卖祖国的可耻行径，孙大雨却一直吹嘘是他在美国人面前反蒋，是对革命的“功劳”。在参加民盟和进步的“大教联”后，孙大雨还继续与朱家骅、陈雪屏等反动头子勾结。
    解放以后，孙大雨继续坚持仇视党、仇视革命的立场。他诬蔑“无产阶级一无所知，共产党没有知识分子，既不能领导革命，也不能领导建设”。他还诬蔑新中国没有自由，说“解放后民主还听到过，自由却没有听到了”，他甚至仇恨学生中的党员和团员，故意在考试时压低他们的分数。孙大雨还在教学改革中散布诬蔑苏联的言论。
    作家章靳以等还在会议上戳穿了孙大雨的“诗人”和“莎士比亚专家”的真面目。原来这个“专家”只翻译过一本莎士比亚剧本“璃琊王”，而孙大雨的所谓“诗人”却是一个见钱如命的人物，灵魂中充满了铜臭。在反右派斗争后复旦大学几次派人要他出来交代，他躺着装病不见人，但听说送工资、送稿费来，就立刻爬起来了。最近复旦大学编译部用了他一篇稿子，孙大雨一定要最高的稿费，并且每页稿纸要多算八十个字。他给文汇报写了一篇文章嫌稿费太少，吵到文汇报去查账，看是否比别人给的少，文汇报只好多给他些钱了事。孙大雨曾诬蔑新社会“没有什么感情”，据代表们揭露，孙大雨自己才真正是个“六亲不认”的人物。有次孙大雨的母亲向他要些火油，孙大雨竟说：“先交钱，后交货，否则不给”。复旦大学一位教授某次向孙大雨借一块钱交民盟盟费，第二天孙大雨就寄明信片给他，要他立刻把一块钱交邮局寄去。
　　人民让他住上十八层楼
    他要把人民踏到十八层地狱
    在17日、19日两天会议上，工人代表卫雪珍、吴良先、胡伟康等对孙大雨的反动言行进行了说理斗争。申太染织厂工人代表王启发说：孙大雨说肃反是“肃革”，证明孙大雨是完全站在反革命分子的立场上说话。南洋烟厂女工代表卫雪珍等驳斥了孙大雨的“工人阶级没有知识”、“不能领导革命”、“不能领导建设”等谬论。卫雪珍说：我们厂里一部车子两个半工人生产，每年可以为国家创造一百一十六万元的财富，而两个半工人每月只要一百七十元。她责问孙大雨：你每月拿了国家四百六十二元，可买大米三千多斤。两年拿了一万多块，你到底为人民做了些什么事？有的代表说：人民把孙大雨送到十八层楼上去（孙大雨住的十八层楼的公寓是政府照顾高级知识分子住的），孙大雨却要把中国人民踏到十八层地狱里去，搞反共、反社会主义的资本主义复辟阴谋。孙大雨完全是忘恩负义之徒。
    孙大雨在代表们的严正驳斥下脸红耳赤，低头不语。代表们要孙大雨再作老实交代。
