    Official Documents No Longer Travel: Cadres Unify Learning and Application; Ministry of Water Resources Has Improved Over 100 Tasks

    (Our Dispatch) By the end of July, the Ministry of Water Resources and its affiliated units had improved 106 tasks.

    In terms of systems, many units have established or improved certain systems. For example, the Hydrology Bureau set the collective office meeting to be held twice a week, ensuring leadership for departments. The Planning and Finance Department and the Design Institute changed the storage system, facilitating the work and document consultation for designers. Some units simplified official document procedures, thus basically eliminating the bad phenomenon of "official documents travelling." For example, the Materials Supply Department drafted a business liaison form, reducing the original ten procedures to three. In the past, the Technology Department had to go through eight procedures to handle an official document. Now it is decided that the department will directly approve the matter to the person in charge. This not only reduced the phenomenon of busywork for leading cadres but also greatly improved work efficiency.

    Various units have made appropriate arrangements for cadres who are unreasonably employed, making it possible for them to "unify learning and application" as much as possible. Comrade Lu Xiaoping of the Planning and Finance Department originally worked in a comprehensive position, which was distant from his technical expertise. He has now been transferred to work on annual plans. The Sanmenxia Office in Beijing merged four sections into three, transferring the surplus cadres to work on the construction site. The issues of cadre training and spare-time learning have also been reasonably resolved.

    In addition to the above-mentioned improvements, various units have also done a lot of work in terms of strengthening the relationship between the Party and the masses, and the relationship between leaders and the led. Leading cadres go deep into the masses and often talk with comrades or solicit opinions on work. For example, two Party member directors of the Engineering Department conducted 27 individual talks with 15 non-Party comrades. Party member cadres also often talk with the masses and make friends. Comrades have a very harmonious relationship. (Li Cheng, Xue Zongde)

### 公文不再旅行　干部学用一致  水利部已改进工作一百多件

    公文不再旅行　干部学用一致
    水利部已改进工作一百多件
    本报讯　水利部及所属各单位到7月下旬止，已改进工作一百零六件。
    在制度方面，很多单位都建立或健全了某些制度，如水文局将集体办公会议定为每星期两次，保证了科室领导。计划财务司和设计院改变了保管制度，便利了工作和设计者参阅文件。有些单位简化了公文手续，因而基本上消灭了“公文旅行”的坏现象。如物资供应处拟制了业务联系单，使原来十道手续减少为三道。技术司过去承办一件公文须经八道手续，现决定由处直接批给经办人。这不但减少了领导干部忙乱的事务主义现象，而且大大提高了工作效率。
    各单位对使用不合理的干部，进行了妥善安排，尽可能使其“学用一致”。计划财务司陆孝平同志原作综合工作，与所学技术有距离，现已调作年度计划工作。三门峡驻京办事处四个科合并为三个科，将多余干部调往工地工作。干部培养和业余学习问题也得到了合理的解决。
    除上述改进工作外，各单位对密切党群关系，领导与被领导关系方面，也都作了很多工作。领导干部深入群众，并经常和同志们谈心或征求工作上的意见。如工务司两个党员司长曾与十五个党外同志进行了二十七次个别谈话。党员干部也经常和群众谈心，交朋友。同志关系非常融洽。　（李成、学宗德）
