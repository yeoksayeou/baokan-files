American Dark Side

    Youth Crime Wave Forms in New York
    Juvenile delinquency in New York City has become a wave, and New York State and City authorities decided on August 6 to transfer 600 police school students to strengthen the suppression.
    All 23,000 police officers in New York City have been mobilized to try to stop the spread of the juvenile delinquency wave, but to no avail.
    Former Republican mayoral candidate of New York City, Christenbury, said that to effectively deal with juvenile delinquency, it is necessary to add 5,000 more police officers.

    Merchants Use Deceptive Tricks to Make a Fortune
    The American "Saturday Evening Post" recently published an article exposing various "sales techniques" used by American furniture store owners to deceive customers.
    The author is a furniture salesman with many years of experience. He gave an example: A couple had wanted to buy a new spring mattress for several weeks. They saw an advertisement we published and thought they had encountered a good opportunity. The advertisement said: "A nationally known mattress with superior springs is sold at half price. The two items together are only priced at $59.50, which is equivalent to the price of one spring or one mattress." They left our furniture store secretly rejoicing. Didn't they buy something worth $119 for only $59.50? The fact is not entirely like that. Two weeks ago, my boss, Wilde, made a long-distance call to a small factory. He said, "Do you remember the spring mattresses with 180 springs worth $13.50 each that you made for me? Put a large floral cover on it, change the brand name, and mark it at $59.50, everything else remains the same."
    The author also said that his boss, Wilde, once took advantage of a store fire to "sell at a discount" a lot of inventory at high prices.
    The author finally pointed out that many American merchants are making big money every day through these deceptive sales techniques without any hindrance, and have not been sanctioned by law.

    美国黑幕
    纽约青年犯罪形成浪潮
    纽约市的青少年犯罪已经成为浪潮，纽约州和市当局8月6日决定调出警察学校的六百名学员加强弹压。
    纽约市的两万三千名警察已经全部动员起来设法阻止青少年犯罪浪潮蔓延，但是无济于事。
    纽约市共和党前市长候选人克里斯登伯利说，要有效地对付青少年犯罪，还需要增加五千名警察。
    商人施展骗术发大财
    美国“星期六晚邮报”最近发表了一篇文章，揭露美国家具店老板们欺骗顾客的各种“销售术”。
    作者是一个有多年经验的家具推销员。他举了一个例子说：一对夫妇好几个星期以来就想买一个新的弹簧床垫。他们看见我们登载的一则广告以为碰到了一个好机会。广告说：“一种全国闻名的附带上等弹簧的床垫半价出售。两样共只售价五十九元五角，只相当于一个弹簧或一个床垫的价钱。”他们暗自庆幸地离开了我们的家具店。他们不是仅仅以五十九元五角的钱买走了价值一百一十九元的东西吗？事实却不完全是这样的。两个星期前，我的老板威尔德打了一个长途电话给一家小工厂。他说：“你还记得你们给我定作的装有一百八十个弹簧的、价值十三元五角一床的弹簧床垫吗？你给它换上一种大花褥套，再换个牌子，作上五十九元五角的标价，其他一切照样。”
    作者还说，他的老板威尔德有一次利用商店失火的机会，用高价“廉售”了许多存货。
    作者最后指出，美国许多商人都毫无阻碍地天天靠这种种骗人的销售术赚大钱，而并没有受到法律的制裁。
