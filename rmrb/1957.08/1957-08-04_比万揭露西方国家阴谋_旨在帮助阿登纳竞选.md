    Bevan Exposes Western Countries' Conspiracy
    Aimed at Helping Adenauer Win Election
    Xinhua News Agency, London, 3rd August. Labour MP Bevan has denounced the Western Four Powers' "Berlin Declaration" as a "conspiracy" designed to influence the Bonn elections in September to Adenauer's advantage.
    Bevan, in an article published in the "Tribune" weekly on August 2nd, pointed out that the Western countries' policy on the German question contains dangers. He warned that "Hitler once used Russia as a demon to undermine Western diplomacy. Adenauer is playing the same trick. Although not as shrill, and without Hitler's warlike tone, in substance, the theme is the same." He pointed out that people like Adenauer, just like Hitler, want to deceive the Western people in order to revive the German military forces and make it once again the "master of Europe's destiny."
    Bevan said that the guarantees given by the Western countries to the Soviet Union are "empty talk on paper."
    He reiterated his view that the German question should be resolved "in a broader solution to the all-European problem with Russia participating."
    Bevan criticised the Western countries' insistence on linking political settlement with disarmament, saying that this "virtually must make the two contradict each other and ultimately be unsolvable." He said that the only explanation for the Western countries' insistence on this attitude is that "they want neither a general disarmament agreement nor a political settlement."

    比万揭露西方国家阴谋
    旨在帮助阿登纳竞选
    新华社伦敦3日电　工党议员比万斥责西方四国的“柏林宣言”是企图影响波恩九月选举使阿登纳获利的“阴谋”。
    比万在8月2日出版的“论坛”周报上发表文章，他指出西方国家对德国问题的政策包含着危险。他警告说，“希特勒曾经利用俄国作为妖魔来破坏西方的外交。阿登纳也在耍同样的把戏。尽管没有那样刺耳、也没有和希特勒一样的好战腔调，但是在实质上，主题是一样的”。他指出，阿登纳之流正和希特勒一样，想蒙蔽西方人民，以便复活德国军事力量，使它再一次成为“欧洲命运的主宰”。
    比万说：西方国家给苏联的保证是“纸上空谈”。
    他重申了他的看法：德国问题应当在“有俄国参加的更广泛的全欧问题的解决办法中”求得解决。
    比万批评西方国家坚持把政治解决和裁军联系起来的作法，“实际上必定使两者相互矛盾而终于无法解决”。他说，西方国家坚持这种态度的唯一解释是：“它们既不要一般的裁军协定，也不要政治解决”。
