Eastern Scales and Western Claws
          Village Power Stations
During the First Five-Year Plan, Fujian Province has already built 57 small hydropower stations, with a total generating capacity of 2,171 kilowatts. In the second half of this year, a new batch of small hydropower stations will be built in Yongchun, Anxi, Huian, and other counties.
Most of these newly built power stations are located in remote mountain villages. They can not only provide lighting for rural areas, but also provide cheap power for rural water pumping for irrigation, rice milling, flour milling, papermaking, sawing wood, iron smelting, tea making, and ice making.
        Qinghai's New Coal Mine
The new inclined shaft of Datong Coal Mine, which supplies coal to eleven counties and cities and dozens of factories in Qinghai, was put into production on the 26th.
Datong Coal Mine began production during the Hongwu period of the Ming Dynasty. However, after more than 500 years, the highest annual output before liberation was only 50,000 tons. Now the annual output has reached 450,000 tons.
      Shanghai to Have Fluorescent Street Lights
The Shanghai Electric Power Administration's Street Lamp Management Office has successfully researched and installed fluorescent street lights, and trial installations will begin in some areas of Shanghai in the fourth quarter of this year. The advantage of fluorescent street lights is that the light is more sufficient than ordinary street lights, but it is soft and not dazzling.
        Using Semiconductor Counting
The Shanghai Post Office receives an average of more than 210,000 letters from citizens to all parts of the country every day. After these letters arrive at the post office, many staff members sort them out by region, weigh them, and roughly estimate that every ten kilograms of letters contains about two thousand letters, making it impossible to record the exact number. Now, they have used semiconductors to make a letter sorting and conveying machine. Each time a letter passes in front of it, the number on the counter jumps by one. There is no need for manual counting one by one.
            Amateur Tea Garden
The Chuanwei Tannery in Chongqing is located in the countryside, five or six li away from the street, and there are no recreational venues nearby. During their rest time, some employees go home, some sleep, and some just wander around, not getting enough rest.
Seeing this situation, the factory's trade union organized an amateur tea garden on July 25. Now the tea garden is full of employees every evening, some drinking tea and chatting, some playing poker and mahjong, and some playing chess. The employees are very satisfied with this place to rest.

    东鳞西爪
          山村的电站
    福建省在第一个五年计划建设期间，已经建成五十七个小型水电站，发电量共二千一百七十一瓩；今年下半年，还将在永春、安溪、惠安等县兴建一批小型水电站。
    这些新建的电站大都在偏僻的山村里，不仅能供给农村照明，还能为农村抽水灌溉、碾米磨粉、造纸、锯木、炼铁、制茶和制冰等提供廉价的动力。
        青海的新煤井
    供青海十一个县市和数十个工厂用煤的大通煤矿新建斜井26日投入生产。
    大通煤矿在明朝洪武年间已开始生产，但是经过五百多年直到解放前夕，最高年产量不过五万吨，现在年产量已经达四十五万吨。
      上海将出现萤光路灯
    上海电业管理局路灯管理所已经研究装置萤光路灯获得成功，今年第四季度就可以在上海个别地区开始试装。萤光路灯的优点是光线比一般路灯充足，但柔和而不刺眼。
        利用半导体数信
    上海市邮局每天收到市民寄到全国各地的信件平均有二十一万多封。这些信件来到邮局以后，很多工作人员按地区把它一封封地拣出来，然后用秤称一称，毛估每十公斤重信件约两千封，根本没办法记出准确的数目。现在，他们利用半导体做了一架信件检分传送机。每一封信从它面前经过时，记数器上的号码就跳一个数字。再不需要人工一封封来点数了。
            业余茶园
    重庆川威制革厂厂址在农村，离街上有五、六里路远，附近没有文娱场所。职工们到了休息时间，有的回家，有的睡觉，有的只好到处转，休息不好。
    厂工会看到这个情形，便在7月25日筹办了一个业余茶园。现在一到晚上茶园里就坐满了职工，有的喝茶谈天，有的打扑克、麻将，有的下象棋。职工们非常满意这个休息的地方。
