Visiting Shanghai's "Cultural Relic Warehouse"
	Ye Qiu

    Back when the Greater Administrative Areas still existed, Shanghai established a Cultural Relic Warehouse, specifically to select cultural relics and materials from scrap copper and waste paper. I remember visiting it back then: a four-story building filled with books, documents, and cultural relics, all rescued from being melted down or turned into paper pulp.
    This time in Shanghai, I visited the "Cultural Relic Warehouse" again. The location has changed; they're squeezed into a few rooms above a warehouse area. The working conditions can be described as poor, with few staff and little money. However, under the leadership and specific assistance of the Cultural Bureau, and with the support of cadres from relevant departments, they have done much valuable work.
    From the so-called "scrap copper and rotten iron" that they collect from the non-ferrous metal recovery and smelting institutions of the metallurgical industry sector, they select complete bronze and iron objects dating from the Shang and Zhou dynasties to the Qing dynasty. Some are important historical relics, and some are production tools, daily necessities, and measuring instruments. I heard that when they select copper objects in the scorching heat, the sun shines on the piles of copper in the mountains, causing a chemical reaction. The copper piles emit a gas, and inhaling too much can cause poisoning. They learned from experience: if their tongue licks their lips and it tastes sweet, they quickly go to the clinic for an injection. After the injection, they return to work. Because they adhere to the principle of not hindering production, they have to hurry to select items so as not to delay the melting process.
    They contact the paper mills of the light industry sector and select useful books and materials from the piles of paper that are about to be sent into the machines to become paper pulp, and from the waste paper warehouses of the supply and marketing cooperatives. They have discovered very important revolutionary documents from the Opium War era onwards, as well as materials reflecting social and economic life. For example, on the day we visited, they found several grain tax tickets from the twelfth year of the Renxu period of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom from the retrieved waste paper, and they also found a large batch of land deeds from certain counties in Zhejiang from the late Ming dynasty to the end of the Qing dynasty. We also saw the Whampoa Military Academy badges, banknotes from the Sichuan-Shaanxi Soviet Area, and reward coins cast by Zhang Xianzhong that they had previously picked out, etc. In terms of book versions, just a glimpse is already astonishing, such as:
	(1) "Newly Engraved Official Edition of the Complete Illustrated Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars and Daily Stories," with pictures above and explanations below, beautifully engraved and printed. The citations contain the characters Yongle and Zhengde, so it should be a Ming edition printed not long after those periods. (2) "Newly Published and Corrected Complete Edition of A New Account of the Trimmed Lamp," with pictures above and explanations below, the pictures are colored, and it is a Jianyang Ming edition. (3) "Complete Account of Yang Guifei," with pictures, beautifully engraved and printed, only volumes three and four remain, it is a Ming edition. (4) "Romance of the Red Dust Girl," with small pictures, printed by "Shu Lin You Jingquan" in the Ming Dynasty, rescued from a waste paper processing factory. (5) "Gazetteer of Taiwan Prefecture." Other examples include "Tianqi Provincial Examination Records," "Newly Compiled Five Noisy Jiao Pa Records," and "Yuan Liaofan's Interpretation of the Romance of the West Chamber," and other medical books such as the early Ming imitation Yuan edition of "Zhang Zhongjing's Annotated Song of Hundred Symptoms of Cold Damage" and the Ming Wanli edition of "Silver Sea Essence," which are relatively rare good editions.
    They have to contact many paper mills, purchasing stations of supply and marketing cooperatives, smelting plants, recycling stations, second-hand stalls, antique markets, etc. Some factories are very good, and according to the joint notices issued by the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Light Industry, and the Ministry of Culture and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, they provide them with convenience. However, in some places, especially individual leaders (workers and staff often help with the work very well) do not pay attention to national laws and regulations or the notices from the competent authorities, and even claim not to know about them; instead of providing various conveniences, they provide various obstacles. Although the comrades of the Shanghai Cultural Relic Warehouse insist on the principle of "absolutely not affecting production," some places still consider it "troublesome" and try every means to prevent them from selecting items. For example, a paper mill once promised that they could go to select a batch of "waste paper" on March 9th. They went on time, but the factory had already turned all the "waste paper" into paper pulp on March 8th.
    They work in extremely difficult conditions, even at the risk of their lives, and they come up with various ways to carry out publicity. For example, when they select useful books, materials or cultural relics in factories or recycling stations, they hold small-scale exhibitions on the spot to explain why they select these things, publicize laws and regulations on the protection of cultural relics, and introduce common knowledge about cultural relics. The masses are very welcome and automatically cooperate to help, setting aside things they think are useful and waiting for the people from the "Cultural Relic Warehouse" to come and see them. However, some leaders are "using their brains and thinking of ways" to avoid them going to "select items."
    In the past year, the "Cultural Relic Warehouse" selected 4,969 cultural relics and more than 100,000 books and materials; in less than three months this year, they have already selected more than 1,000 cultural relics and more than 109,000 books and materials.
    When the Shanghai Cultural Bureau and the Shanghai Cultural Relic Warehouse handle these cultural relics, they not only take care of this city, but also take care of museums and libraries in other provinces and cities. For example, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, the Palace Museum in Beijing, the History Museum, and recently Inner Mongolia and Guizhou, are all preparing to allocate a batch of relevant cultural relics and books from them. The comrades in the "Cultural Relic Warehouse" have no localism at all, and their work does not start from personal hobbies, nor are they reluctant to hand over good things after they have been sorted out. They try their best to help others select items, make lists, transport them, etc.
    They rescue cultural relics and books that are about to be destroyed from so-called "broken copper" and "waste paper," and then sort and distribute them in a dark room, squeezed into a corner. The air is very bad, and the work is intense. They study the country's laws, policies, and relevant commentaries published in newspapers very seriously. For example, when the People's Daily published a commentary on "The Collection of Books and Materials" on March 29th, they not only studied it, but also immediately implemented the suggestions in the commentary in their selection work; while some cultural administrative departments, even the comrades in charge of this matter, did not read it at all.
    Most of the comrades working here were not familiar with this kind of work, but they study their profession while working; the reference books they select from discarded books and waste paper are their teachers. In many places, many people are complaining all day long about the poor conditions and their inability to work; while the comrades working here, when we visited, were not talking about demanding any material or living conditions, or any plans for fame and fortune, but were worried that they could not keep up with the work. In a place as big as Shanghai, with such a wide scope of work, people are turning materials that could provide scientific research into paper pulp and melting them down at any time; they are thinking about how to rescue these useful things, and also thinking about how to further expand the scope of work and plug some loopholes.
    Their work attitude is worthy of praise and worthy of our study. Their work also deserves strong support and assistance from relevant units, especially the authorities in charge of handling so-called "scrap copper" and "waste paper." In order to protect the national cultural heritage and provide us with scientific research materials, we hope that they will provide practical and effective assistance!

    访上海“文物仓库”
    冶秋
    远在大行政区还存在的时候，上海就设立了文物仓库，专门从废铜废纸里拣选文物资料。记得那时曾去看过：在一个四层楼的大房子里，堆满了图书资料和文物，都是从马上就要溶化和造纸浆的情况下抢救出来的。
    这次来上海，又去访问了“文物仓库”。地点改变了，在一个仓库区的楼上挤了几间房，工作条件可以说很差，人手不多，钱也很少，可是他们在文化局的领导和具体帮助下，有关机关干部的支援下，作了许多难能可贵的工作。
    他们向冶金工业部门的有色金属回收、冶炼等机构收来的所谓“废铜烂铁”的仓库里，拣选出从商周起直到清代一些完整的铜器、铁器，有些是重要的历史文物，有些是生产工具、生活用品以及度量衡等器具。听说他们在大热天拣选铜器时，在堆集如山的铜铁堆里，太阳照射在铜堆上，发生化学作用，铜堆里有一股气体，闻多了会中毒。他们有了经验：舌头舔着嘴唇，发甜了，就赶快到医务所打一种针，打完以后，再回来工作。因为他们坚持不妨碍生产的原则，得赶快拣选，以免耽误了那边的溶化。
    他们向轻工业部门的造纸厂联系，从即将送进机器变为纸浆的堆集如山的纸堆里，从供销合作社的废纸仓库里，拣选出有用的图书资料。这里边发现了从鸦片战争以来很重要的革命文献，和反映社会经济生活的资料。例如我们去的那天，他们就从取来的烂纸里，找出几张太平天国壬戍十二年的钱粮票，又找出一大批从明季到清末浙江某些县的田地契。我们还看到他们过去挑出的黄浦军校证章、川陕苏区钞票、张献忠铸的赏功钱，等等。再就图书版本来说，随便看到的一点已经是足以惊人的，如：
    （一）“新刻官版全象二十四孝日记故事”，上图下说，刻印精美，引文中有永乐、正德等字样，当系后此不久的明刻本。（二）“新刊校正足本剪灯余话”，上图下说，图着彩色，为建阳明刻本。（三）“杨太真全记”，带图，刻印精美，仅存三四两卷，系明刻本。（四）“红拂记”，带小图，明“书林游敬泉梓”，从废纸加工厂救出。（五）台湾府志。其他如“天启乡试录”、“新编五闹蕉帕记”和“袁了凡释义西厢记”等，还有明初仿元刻本“张仲景注解伤寒百证歌”，明万历本“银海精微”等医书，都是比较少见的善本。
    他们要同许多造纸厂、供销合作社的收购站、冶炼厂、回收站、旧货摊贩、古玩市场等处联系。有的厂很好，根据文化部和轻工业部、文化部和全国供销合作总社发的联合通知，对于他们予以便利。但是，有些地方，尤其是个别负责人（工人、职员往往是很好帮助工作的）对于国家法令、主管机关的通知毫不重视，甚至推说不知道；不是予以各种方便，而是予以各种阻碍。虽然上海文物仓库的同志坚持了“绝不影响生产”的原则，但有些地方还是认为是“麻烦”，想方设法，不让他们去拣选。例如，有一家纸厂曾经答应他们在3月9日去拣一批“废纸”，他们按时去了，而厂方却在8日已把这批“废纸”全部造了纸浆。
    他们是在极困难的条件下，甚至是在冒生命的危险下工作，他们想出各种办法来进行宣传。例如，他们在工厂或回收站，拣选出有用的图书资料或文物，就在当地举行小型展览，说明为什么要拣选这些东西，并宣传文物保护法令，介绍文物常识。群众很欢迎，自动地协力帮助，将认为有用的东西放在一边，等着“文物仓库”的人来看。但是，有些负责人却在“动脑筋，想办法”，避免他们去“拣选”。
    “文物仓库”在去年一年中拣选了文物四千九百六十九件，图书资料十万多件、册；今年不到三个月时间，已经拣选了文物一千多件，图书资料十万九千多件、册。
    上海文化局和上海文物仓库处理这批文物的时候，他们不但照顾了本市，也照顾了其他省、市的博物馆和图书馆。如浙江、江苏、北京的故宫博物院、历史博物馆，以及最近内蒙古、贵州，都预备从中分配一批有关的文物图书。而“文物仓库”的工作同志，丝毫没有本位观念，工作也不是从个人爱好出发，不是整理出了好东西就舍不得交出。他们尽量帮助别人挑选，造册，运输，……。
    他们在所谓“破铜”“废纸”中把即将毁掉的文物图书抢救出来，然后在一个灰暗房子内，挤在角落里整理、分配。空气是很坏的，工作是紧张的。他们对于国家的法令、政策，以及报纸上发表的有关评论等，都很认真学习。例如，人民日报在3月29日发表了“关于图书资料的收集问题”的评论，他们不但进行了学习，而且马上就在拣选工作中来实现评论中的建议；而有些文化行政部门，甚至是主管这件事的同志却根本没看。
    这里的工作同志，他们大多本来是不熟悉这行工作的，但他们一面工作，一面钻研业务；从废书废纸里拣选出来一些参考书，就是他们的老师。有很多地方，很多人，整天在吵着条件不好，不能工作；而这里的工作同志，我们去访问的时候，他们所谈的不是要求什么物质条件和生活条件，不是什么名利双收的打算，而是愁着工作作不过来。上海这样大的地方，工作面这样广，随时随刻都有人在把一些可以提供科学研究的资料造纸浆，溶化；他们就是想到如何把这些有用的东西抢救下来，并且还想到如何更开展一些工作面，把一些漏洞堵塞住。
    他们的工作态度，是值得表扬、值得我们学习的。他们的工作，也值得有关单位予以大力支持和帮助的，尤其是主管处理所谓“废铜”“废纸”的机关，为了保护民族文化遗产，为了供给我们科学研究资料，更希望予以切实有效的援助！
