　　Japan's Agriculture and Rural Economy
　　Lan Hai
　　(I)
　　After the war, Japan implemented "agricultural land reform" in its rural areas, and the landlord system basically collapsed, with the original landlord class having been differentiated. As a result, the basic class contradiction in rural areas has transformed into a contradiction between monopoly capital, dependent on U.S. imperialism, and the farmers. However, in the postwar agricultural land reform, the Japanese people did not thoroughly benefit from the principle of distributing land to farmers with little or no land, and the demands related to open mountain and forest areas, which were important to the vast majority of farmers, were also rejected. This is the characteristic of Japan's postwar "agricultural land reform." Due to this relationship, feudal remnants still widely persist in Japanese rural areas.
　　After the war, especially farmers in mountain and forest areas, in order to obtain independent and commercialized conditions in their operations, waged struggles demanding the opening of mountains and forests, but the U.S. imperialists and the Japanese government rejected their demands, only opening up some pastures and grasslands. In addition, the U.S. imperialists and the Japanese government also took 1.3 million chōbu (a Japanese unit of area for fields, mountains, and forests; 10 tan = 1 chōbu; 1 chōbu is approximately equal to 1 hectare) of imperial family-owned forests into state ownership to eliminate one of the material bases of the absolutist imperial system, and further implemented enterprise-oriented and capitalist policies in all private and state-owned mountain and forest areas.
　　Thus, in terms of farmland, the landlord system collapsed, and on this basis, the commodity economy of individual farmers developed, and signs of enrichment, i.e., capitalization, of some upper-class farmers also appeared; while in terms of mountains and forests, the original parasitic landlord class, headed by large mountain forest owners, on the one hand, still utilized all the old forms of exploitation on their land, and on the other hand, gradually shifted towards capitalist exploitation and management.

　　(II)
　　Due to agricultural land reform, land was owned by farmers, and farmers who broke away from the landlord economy increased their enthusiasm for production, and agricultural productivity developed. Unlike the pre-war situation under landlord rule, farmers are now free to choose crops that are beneficial to them to sow. As a result, the small commodity production of farmers has developed. Post-war inflation, food shortages, the dispersal of factories to various places, the development of transportation, and the suburbanization of rural areas that accompanied these factors, promoted the commercial production of agriculture.
　　Of course, the direct and cruel plunder by domestic and foreign monopoly capital seriously hindered the normal development of the agricultural commodity economy. Nevertheless, about 12 million koku of rent rice that the landlords used to bring to the market and about 10 million koku of rice increased due to the development of productivity are now brought to the market again by the hands of the farmers. The rate of commercialization of grain after the war has increased from 46% before the war to 60%. Looking at other commercial crops, with 1933-1935 as 100, the production index for 1951-1953 was 164 for livestock products, 159 for beans, 130 for vegetables, and 111 for industrial crops. At the same time, there have been changes in the production areas of agricultural products. Thus, as a result of agricultural commercialization, the increase in farmers' purchasing power is estimated to be about 300 billion yen.
　　With the commercialization of agriculture, the use of agricultural machinery, fertilizers, agricultural medicines, and the consumption of feed have increased, and land improvement, variety improvement, etc. have also progressed, and the yield per unit area and the average harvest per labor force have increased.

　　(III)
　　After the war, although there was a tendency towards commercialization and increased productivity in agriculture, the development of agriculture was greatly hindered due to the direct and cruel plunder by domestic and foreign monopoly capital and the government. Therefore, the class differentiation of farmers is also abnormal, the formation of kulak-capitalist agriculture is hindered, poor farmers find it difficult to find wage labor opportunities within agriculture, so they are constantly proletarianizing while seeking wage labor outside of agriculture. Despite this characteristic, the tendency of farmers to polarize is still increasing.
　　The areas where the commercial development of agriculture and the class differentiation of farmers are proceeding most slowly are usually rice-producing areas. Let's take this area (the Saga Prefecture Plain area) as an example to look at the spread of agricultural machinery: In 1954, there was an average of one power tiller for every 3,696 households with less than 3 tan of land, while there was an average of one power tiller for every 1.7 households with 3 chō or more of land. There was an average of one fully automatic thresher for every 3,696 households with less than 3 tan of land, while there was an average of one fully automatic thresher for every 3.9 households with 3 chō or more of land. Machines are always concentrated in the upper-class farm households. In the same area, the capital composition in agricultural management is also higher as you go higher in the class structure.
　　Looking at the income and expenditure relationship of agriculture (1953), farm households with less than 5 tan of land had a deficit of 202,000 yen, and farm households with 5 tan to 1 chō of land also had a deficit of 108,000 yen. Most of these classes are semi-proletarianized farm households who also engage in other occupations, barely maintaining their lives with income other than agriculture. On the other hand, the class with 2 chō or more of land had a surplus of 205,000 yen, and with the addition of income other than agriculture, they had a surplus of 301,000 yen.
　　The commercialization and capitalization of agriculture, and the class differentiation that accompanies it, first appear in commodity crops and farm households that manage commodity crops. The management of commodity agricultural products such as fruits, tea, vegetables, industrial crops, and cheese is generally concentrated in the upper-class farm households.
　　From the above facts, it can be concluded that although Japanese agriculture has various special characteristics, the class differentiation of farmers is still proceeding.

　　(IV)
　　In the process of such changes, because they cannot maintain their lives by relying solely on agriculture, the number of farm households that also engage in other occupations has increased, most of which are also engaged in wage labor. In 1933, the total number of farm households was 5.43 million, of which 2.93 million also engaged in other occupations, accounting for 54% of the total number of households, while in 1954, the total number of farm households increased to 6.1 million, of which 3.73 million also engaged in other occupations, accounting for 61.1% of the total number of households. From the perspective of commercial agriculture, most of the specialized farm households are engaged in the production of agricultural commodities, while most of the Type 1 part-time farm households (those who use other occupations as a supplement) and Type 2 part-time farm households (those who use other occupations as the main occupation) are generally engaged in the production of grain.
　　The absolute amount of part-time income of upper-class farm households is relatively small, and their sources of part-time income are the use of their own industries, property, and salaries. The salary income of this class is the income of their children as teachers, officials, staff, and various wage laborers.
　　However, lower-class farmers are forced to live a life in which they cannot get enough to eat by relying solely on wages and cannot get enough to eat by relying solely on agricultural income due to the oppression of monopoly capital and the government. In other words, they have both the demands of workers and the demands of farmers, and the two are integrated in them. The U.S. imperialists and monopolists refused to distribute land to poor farmers during the agricultural land reform period, and they implemented a policy of plundering all farmers in order to squeeze lower-class farmers out of agriculture and exploit them with low wages. The surplus population latent in the lower-class farmers is one of the guarantees for domestic and foreign monopoly capital to seize the greatest profits. The remnants of feudal forces in rural areas oppress this class the most, this class rents the most land, and this class suffers the most from black rent and other harsh conditions, and they are also the most uneasy about the landlord taking back the land. Because in this class with the least land, the landlord taking back the land is a matter of life and death for them. Status differences, tribes, and habitual feudal remnants also have a great binding force on this class. This poor farmer class is the focus of contradictions in rural areas under state monopoly capitalism. This class of farmers has almost nothing to lose, and they are closest to the proletariat.

　　(V)
　　After the agricultural land reform, the development of commercial agriculture, the improvement of agricultural productivity, and the class differentiation of farmers have become important factors in expanding the domestic market in rural areas and in the accumulation of state monopoly capital. The increase in the purchasing power of rural areas for means of production and means of consumption has not only become an important part of the domestic market for monopoly capital that has lost its colonies, but also the taxes paid by farmers, the grain supplied, the exploitation of farmers using the scissors differential, and the surplus population in rural areas have become important conditions for the re-emergence of monopoly capital after the war.
　　The actual amount of farmers' purchases of means of production in 1954 was more than twice that before the war (1934-1936), and during the same period, the amount of purchases of means of consumption increased by 76%. Farmers' purchases account for about one-tenth of the total domestic purchases. Moreover, monopoly capital sells its products to farmers at monopoly prices and buys farmers' products at low prices. At the end of the war, one straw bag of rice could be exchanged for ten straw bags of ammonium sulfate, but now it cannot be exchanged for even five straw bags. Monopoly capital directly grabs farmers in its hands in departments such as cheese, tobacco, tea, and sericulture and exploits them. For example, in terms of tobacco leaves, the income of farmers per tan of land is 50,000 yen, and each working day is 232 yen, while the profit of the monopoly company averages 190,000 yen per tan of land.
　　Compared with the average figure for 1934-1936, farmers' income actually increased to 1.4 times in 1951, but the amount of income tax collected from farmers is estimated to have increased to at least six times during the same period. Monopoly capital also absorbs farmers' funds through the Agricultural and Forestry Central Treasury and banks, and 27% of the surplus funds of the farmer economy in fiscal year 1952 flowed out of agriculture and became bank deposits and marketable securities. Since 1954, Japan's agricultural and forestry budget has been continuously reduced, cheap grain has been imported, and the grain production increase policy that requires spending money has been abandoned.
　　The Japanese government is sacrificing Japanese agriculture in this way to make agriculture subordinate to the requirements of U.S.-Japan monopoly capital, which aims to maintain a low-wage system, increase labor productivity, increase exports, and strengthen armaments.

　　日本的农业和农村经济
　　蓝海
　　（一）
    战后，在日本农村中实行了“农地改革”，地主所有制已经基本崩溃，原来的地主阶级已经分化了。其结果，农村中基本的阶级矛盾，已变为依附于美帝国主义的垄断资本和农民之间的矛盾。但在战后的农地改革中，日本人民并没有彻底得到按照把土地分给少地或无地农民的原则分配土地的实惠，并且同广大农民有关的开放山林地区的要求也被拒绝了。这就是战后日本“农地改革”的特征。由于这种关系，在日本农村中，仍然普遍地残留着封建的遗习。
    战后特别是山林地带的农民，为了在经营上获得独立和商业化的条件，进行了要求开放山林的斗争，但美帝国主义者和日本政府拒绝了他们的要求，仅仅开放了一部分牧场和草场。此外，美帝国主义者和日本政府还把一百三十万町步（日本田亩山林的面积单位，十反为一町步，一町步约等于一公顷）的皇室所有林收为国有，以消除绝对主义天皇制的物质基础之一，并进一步在私有和国有的全部山林地区，实施了企业化和资本主义化的政策。
    这样，在农田方面，地主制度崩溃了，在这个基础上，个体农民的商品经济发展了，一部分上层农民的富农化，即资本主义化的征象也出现了；而在山林方面，以大山林所有者为首的原来的寄生地主阶级，在自己的土地上，一方面仍利用着一切旧的剥削方式，一方面又渐渐地向着资本主义剥削和经营的方向转变。
　　（二）
    由于农地改革，土地归为农民所有，脱离了地主经济的农民提高了生产热情，农业生产力得到了发展。和战前处于地主统治下的情况不同，现在农民能够自由选择播种对自己有利的农作物了。因此农民的小商品生产有了发展。战后的通货澎涨、食品不足、工厂向各地的分散、交通的发展，以及伴随这些而来的农村的近郊化，促进了农业的商品生产化。
    当然，国内外垄断资本的直接残酷的掠夺，严重地阻碍着农业商品经济的正常发展。尽管如此，从前地主拿到市场上的一千二百万石左右的租米和由于生产力的发展而增产的约一千万石大米，现在却重新由农民之手送到市场上来了。战后粮食的商品化的比率已从战前的46％上升到60％。再从其他商品作物来看，以1933—1935为一百，1951—1953的生产指数，畜产品为一百六十四、豆类一百五十九、蔬菜一百三十、工艺作物一百一十一。同时农产品的出产地区，也有了变化。这样，由于农业商业化的结果，农民购买力的增加估计约为三千亿日元。
    随着农业的商业化，农业机器、肥料的使用，农业药品、饲料的消费都有了增加，土地改良、品种改良等也有了进展，单位面积产量和每个劳动力平均的收获量都有了增加。
　　（三）
    战后，在农业中虽然出现了商业化和生产力增加的趋向，但由于国内外垄断资本和政府的直接的残酷的掠夺，农业的发展受到了很大的阻碍。因此，农民的阶级分化也不正常，富农—资本主义农业的形成受到了阻碍，贫农在农业内部难以找到工资劳动的机会，因此他们在向农业以外谋求工资劳动的同时正在不断走向无产阶级化。尽管具有这种特征，农民向两极分化的倾向仍在增长。
    农业的商业性发展，农民的阶级分化进行得最缓慢的地区，通常是产米地区。即以这种地区（佐贺县平原区）为例，看一看农业机器的普及情况吧：在1954年，动力耕耘机在有三反土地以下的农户，平均三千六百九十六户一台，而拥有三町土地以上的农户，平均每一点七户就有一台。全自动脱谷机，有三反土地以下的农户，平均三千六百九十六户一台、而拥有三町土地以上的农户，平均每三点九户就有一台。机器总是集中于上层农户。在同一地区，农业经营中的资本构成也是越往上层越高。
    从农业的收支关系来看（1953年），五反土地以下的农户，有二十万二千日元的亏空，五反—一町土地的农户，也有十万八千日元的亏空。这些阶层，多半是半无产阶级化了的兼作其他营生的农户，靠着农业以外的收入勉强维持生活。而有二町土地以上的阶层，则有二十万五千日元的盈余，再加上农业以外的收入则有三十万一千日元的盈余。
    农业的商业化、资本主义化以及与此相伴随的阶级分化，首先出现在商品作物和经营商品作物的农户上。果树、茶、蔬菜、工艺作物、乳酪等这些商品性农产物的经营一般都集中在上层农户。
    从以上的事实中，可以得出结论：日本的农业尽管有着种种特殊性，农民的阶级分化却依然在进行着。
　　（四）
    在这样的变化过程中，由于仅靠农业不能维持生活，兼作其他营生的农产数目就增大了，其中大部分是兼作工资劳动。1933年农户总数是五百四十三万户，其中兼作其他营生的有二百九十三万户，占总户数的54％，而1954年农户总数增加到六百一十万户，其中兼作其他营生的有三百七十三万户，占总户数的61.1％。从商业性农业的角度看，专业农户大部分是经营商品生产的农业的，而第一种兼业（以其他职业为辅的）农户的大多数和第二种兼业（以其他职业为主的）农户，大体上都是生产粮食的。
    上层农户的兼业收入的绝对额是比较少的，他们的兼业收入的来源是对自营产业、财产的利用以及薪俸等等。这个阶层的薪俸收入，是他们的子女作教员、官吏、职员和各种工资劳动所得。
    但是，下层农民由于垄断资本和政府的压榨，被迫过着仅靠工资吃不饱、仅靠农业收入也吃不饱的生活。也就是说，他们兼有作为工人的要求和作为农民的要求，这两者在他们身上是混为一体的。美帝国主义者和垄断资本家在农地改革时期，拒绝分给贫农土地，他们实行了对全体农民进行掠夺的政策，以便把下层农民从农业中排挤出来，用低工资对他们加以剥削。潜在于下层农民中的过剩人口乃是国内外垄断资本攫取最大利润的保证之一。农村中残存的封建势力压迫得最重的是这个阶层，租种土地最多的是这个阶层，忍受黑地租及其他恶劣条件压榨的，也以这个阶层为最，他们对于出租土地者收回土地也最感不安。因为在土地最少的这一阶层，出租土地者收回土地对于他们就是生死攸关的问题。身分上的差别、部落、习惯上的封建残余习气等等对于这一阶层也具有很大的束缚力。这一贫农阶层是国家垄断资本主义统治下的农村中的矛盾的焦点。这一阶层的农民几乎没有什么可以丧失的东西，他们是最接近于无产阶级的。
　　（五）
    在农地改革之后，商业性农业的发展，农业生产力的提高和农民的阶级分化，成了在农村中扩大国内市场、成了国家垄断资本积累的重要因素之一。农村对于生产资料和消费资料的购买力的提高，不仅对于丧失了殖民地的垄断资本来说成了国内市场的重要部分，而且农民交纳的税金，供应的粮食，以及利用剪刀差对农民的剥削，农村的过剩人口等等也都成了战后垄断资本重新兴起的重要条件。
    农民对生产资料的实际购买额，1954年为战前（1934—1936）的二倍以上，在同一期间，消费资料的购买额增加了76％。在国内总购买额中，农民购买额约占十分之一。而且垄断资本是以垄断价格向农民卖出他们的制品，而以低价收买农民的产品的。战争结束时，一草袋大米可换十草袋硫安，现在却换不到五草袋。垄断资本在乳酪、烟叶、茶、养蚕等部门直接把农民抓在手里加以剥削。例如在烟叶方面，农民每反土地的收入为五万日元，每一劳动日为二百三十二日元，而专卖公司的利润，平均每反土地却达十九万日元。
    农民的收入与1934—1936的平均数字比较，1951年实际上增长到一点四倍，可是从农民手中征收的所得税额，在同一时期估计至少也增加到六倍。垄断资本并且通过农林中央金库、银行吸收农民款项，1952年度的农民经济剩余金的27％流出农业以外，变成了银行存款和有价证券。日本农林预算自1954年以来不断削减，输入廉价粮食，放弃了需要花钱的粮食增产政策。
    日本政府就是这样用牺牲日本农业的方法，来使农业从属于目的在于维持低工资制、提高劳动生产率、增加输出以及加强军备的美日垄断资本的要求。
