    Uprightness is Promoted, Evil Declines
    New Atmosphere Appears in Jiangxi's Rural Areas

    Nanchang, August 6th (reporter Li Lianbin) – Reported: In Jiangxi's rural areas, while carrying out socialist ideological education movement and combating the counter-offensive of illegal landlords and rich peasants, uprightness is promoted and evil declines in the countryside.

    When the right-wing elements launched a frenzied attack on the Party, many landlord and rich peasant elements in Jiangxi took the opportunity to spread anti-socialist remarks, saying that "unified purchase and sales should be abolished" and "the three freedoms (freedom of buying and selling, freedom of borrowing, freedom of production) should be advocated." Some even carried out counter-offensive and retaliation, beating cadres. As a result, some rural cadres were once ideologically confused, and some old upper-middle peasants wavered about taking the socialist road.

    Since the beginning of July, a socialist ideological propaganda and education movement has been carried out in the vast rural areas of Jiangxi Province. The main contents are: the great victory of the socialist revolution, class education, the relationship between democracy and centralism, freedom and discipline, etc. While carrying out education, various counties have universally struggled against landlords and rich peasant elements who have carried out destructive activities, and punished some criminal elements. This movement has brought a new atmosphere to the countryside, the enthusiasm of the masses for production is high, and the cadres are excited and active. At present, the movement is gradually deepening.

    正气伸张，邪气下降
    江西农村出现新气象
    本报南昌6日电　记者李连斌报道：江西农村在开展社会主义思想教育运动当中，结合打击不法地主、富农分子的反攻倒算，农村中正气伸张，邪气下降。
    在右派分子向党猖狂进攻的时候，江西许多地主、富农分子乘机散布反社会主义言论，说什么“统购统销要取消”“三大自由（买卖自由、借贷自由、生产自由）要提倡”，有的甚至进行反攻倒算，殴打干部。部分农村干部因此一度思想混乱，有些老上中农对走社会主义道路发生动摇。
    7月上旬以来，江西省广大农村全面开展了社会主义思想宣传教育运动，主要内容是：社会主义革命的伟大胜利、阶级教育，民主与集中、自由和纪律的关系等项。各县在开展教育的同时，普遍对有破坏活动的地主、富农分子进行了斗争，并惩办了一些刑事犯罪分子。这一运动给农村带来了新气象，群众生产情绪高涨，干部兴奋积极。目前，运动正在逐步深入。
