The struggle against the rightists is a fierce political and ideological struggle. Currently, this struggle is continuing to deepen.

In the field of science, some rightists are also spreading absurd remarks, attempting to obliterate the facts of China's scientific progress, sow discord between the Party and scientists, and plot to overthrow the Communist Party's leadership over science, in order to achieve their political ambitions.

I will now use my own experience to refute the lies of the rightists. The rightists say: In the past eight years, shortcomings have been the main aspect in the field of science, and achievements are secondary. Is this really the case? No! Absolutely not. In the past eight years, the progress of China's scientific undertaking has been obvious to all. Taking the popularization of science, which I am familiar with, as an example, under the leadership of the Party and with the participation of the broad masses of scientists, it has also developed rapidly in the past few years. Its speed of development is unprecedented, not to mention in old China, but also in capitalist countries. In the second year after the founding of the People's Republic of China, our country had an organization for the popularization of science. By the end of last year, twenty-seven provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, and one thousand and seventy-five counties across the country had established such organizations. The number of members has grown to 210,000. This is a powerful army for the popularization of science. This army regularly carries out popular science lectures in factories, mines, rural areas, troops, and government offices. According to incomplete statistics, more than 280,000 science lectures were held in 1956 alone. In addition, 3,000 science exhibitions were held, 13,000 science films and slides were shown, and more than 4,300 kinds of popular science pamphlets and publicity materials were published. Popular science journals such as "Knowledge is Power," "Science for the Masses," "Science Pictorial," and "Learn Science" are also sponsored by the association. The association has also established two popular science publishing houses and two image data factories in Beijing and Shanghai. The Beijing Planetarium, which was built by the association, will be officially opened this year. This is a place to popularize astronomical knowledge to the broad masses.

Are these not the achievements of China's scientific progress? These achievements cannot be covered up by the dark clouds of the rightists.

In order to sow discord between the Party and scientists, the rightists put forward the slogan of "protecting scientists," which is simply a malicious slander against the Party. Everyone knows that the Party's concern and care for scientists is meticulous, and the personal experiences of many scientists can prove this. Take myself as an example. I am a sick scientific worker, and the Party has been taking care of me for nearly twenty years. As far back as thirty years ago, when I was studying abroad, I was young, healthy, and lively. I was studying bacteriology, and unfortunately, I was infected with encephalitis virus in the laboratory and contracted an incurable disease. After returning to China, during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, I suffered all kinds of cold treatment and persecution from the old society. I was plagued by poverty and illness, and there was no medical treatment, let alone scientific research.

Since November 1937, the day I set foot on the land of Yan'an, I have received the Party's infinite concern and cordial care. In January 1939, I gloriously joined the Communist Party of China and was determined to dedicate my disabled life to the Party, to the motherland, and to the great cause of communism. The Party cared for my health like a mother, sending me from Yan'an to Chongqing, and then from Chongqing to Hong Kong for medical treatment. It always hoped to cure my illness so that I could better work for the Party and serve the people.

During the days of the outbreak of the Pacific War, and during the days of the Great Retreat in Guilin, the Party tried its best to rescue me from danger. In the difficult years before liberation, I received the Party's assistance and support. Without the Party, I would not have lived to this day.

Now, although my body is nearly paralyzed, under the care of the Party, and with the treatment of Soviet experts, my illness is also improving day by day. With the help of my comrades, I can still persist in writing, work hard for the popularization of science, and contribute every bit of strength to the socialist construction of the motherland. This is the happiness that the Party has given me.

Now the rightists put forward the slogan of "protecting scientists" to confuse the masses and create the impression that the Party is "threatening" the work of scientists and that only they can "protect scientists." This is nonsense, this is a great slander against the Party.

Dark clouds cannot block the sun's rays, and storms cannot stop a firm and forward-moving ship. Scientific workers unite, under the leadership of the Party, actively participate in the struggle against the rightists, smash all the conspiracies of the rightists, so that China's scientific undertaking can move forward at a faster speed towards the great goals of socialism and communism.

    反右派的斗争，是一场激烈的政治思想斗争。目前，这种斗争正在继续深入。
    在科学的领域内，也有一些右派分子散布荒谬的言论，企图抹煞我国科学进步的事实，挑拨党和科学家之间的关系，阴谋推翻共产党对科学的领导，以达到他们的政治野心。
    我现在以我亲身的经历和体验来驳斥右派分子的谎言。右派分子说：八年来，在科学领域内缺点是主要的，成绩是次要的。真的是这样吗？不！绝对不是这样。八年来，我国科学事业的进步，是有目所共睹的。就以我所熟悉的科学普及工作为例，几年来在党的领导和广大科学家的参与下，也有飞跃的发展。它的发展速度，不用说在旧中国，就是在资本主义国家也是没有的。中华人民共和国诞生后的第二年，我国就有了科学普及协会的组织，到去年年底为止，全国已经有二十七个省、市和自治区，一千零七十五个县都建立了这样的组织。会员人数发展到二十一万人。这是一支强大的科学宣传大军。这支大军，经常地在工矿、农村、部队和机关里进行通俗科学讲演工作。根据不完全的统计，在1956年，就举行过科学讲演二十八万多次。此外，还举行科学展览三千次，放映科学电影和幻灯一万三千次，出版科普小册子和宣传资料四千三百多种。“知识就是力量”、“科学大众”、“科学画报”、“学科学”等通俗科学期刊，也是协会所主办的。协会还在北京和上海两地成立了两个科普出版社和两个形象资料厂。协会所筹建的北京天文馆将在今年正式开放。这是一座向广大群众普及天文知识的场所。
    这些难道不是我国科学进步的成绩吗？这些成绩是右派的乌云掩盖不了的。
    右派分子为了挑拨党同科学家的关系，提出所谓“保护科学家”的口号，这简直是对党恶毒的污蔑。谁都知道，党对科学家的关怀和照顾是无微不至的，许多科学家的亲身经历都可以证明这一点。就拿我来说，我是一个有病的科学工作者，党照顾我已经将有二十年了。远在三十年前，当我在国外留学的时候，那时候我还年青、健壮、活泼，我研究细菌学，不幸有一次在试验室里受到脑炎病毒的传染，而得了不治之症。回国后，在国民党反动统治时期，我受尽了旧社会的冷遇和迫害，贫病交加，医药无告，更谈不到科学研究了。
    自从1937年11月，我踏上延安的土地那一天起，就受到党的无限关怀和亲切的照顾。在1939年1月，我光荣地加入了中国共产党，决心把我残废的生命献给党，献给祖国，献给共产主义的伟大事业。党母亲般地关心着我的健康，把我从延安送到重庆，又从重庆送到香港去医疗。总希望能治好我的病，使我能更好的为党工作，为人民服务。
    在太平洋战争爆发的日子里，在桂林大撤退的日子里，党却尽力设法救我脱险。在解放前的艰难岁月里，我却受到党的接济和援助。没有党，我就不能活到今天。
    现在我的身体虽然将近瘫痪，但是在党的爱护之下，有苏联专家为我治疗，我的病也日有起色。在同志们帮助之下，我仍能坚持写作，为科学普及工作而努力，为祖国的社会主义建设供献出一点一滴的力量。这是党给我的幸福。
    现在右派分子提出所谓“保护科学家”的口号，来迷惑群众，给人们造成一种印象，似乎是说党在“威胁”科学家的工作，只有他们才能“保护科学家”。这真是胡说八道，这是对党极大的污蔑。
    乌云遮不住太阳的光芒，风浪阻止不了坚定前进的大船。科学工作者团结起来，在党的领导下，积极参加反右派的斗争，粉碎右派分子的一切阴谋活动，使我国的科学事业能以更快的速度，向着社会主义、共产主义的伟大目标前进。
