Xinhua News Agency, August 21st. In order to further clarify that book print runs are to be determined by publishers, the Ministry of Culture issued a notice to local cultural bureaus, publishers, and Xinhua Bookstores on August 13th. It also proposed three plans to improve the distribution relationship between publishers and Xinhua Bookstores, to ensure the publishers' actual decision-making power regarding book print runs.

The notice points out that while the needs of readers are certainly a factor in determining book print runs, the publishing intention and the quality of the content are even more important factors. Only by correctly determining book print runs based on the publishing intention and the quality of the book’s content can the Party's and the state's principles and policies for the publishing industry be better reflected. To achieve this, the print run must be determined by the publisher.

    文化部通知
　　书籍印数由出版社决定
    据新华社21日讯　为了进一步明确书籍印数由出版社决定，文化部于8月13日给各地文化局、出版社和新华书店发出通知，并提出三个方案，改进出版社和新华书店之间的经销的关系，以保证出版社在书籍印数方面的实际决定权。
    通知指出书籍印数的确定，读者的需要固然是一个因素，书籍的出版意图和内容质量更是一个重要的因素。只有根据出版意图和书籍内容质量正确决定书籍的印数，才能更好地体现党和国家对出版事业的方针、政策。要做到这点，印数就必须由出版社决定。
