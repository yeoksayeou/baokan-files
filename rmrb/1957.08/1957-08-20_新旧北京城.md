Beijing, a city with a long history and a splendid cultural heritage, has been the capital since the Liao Dynasty more than a thousand years ago. Through the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, as well as the rule of the Northern Warlords and the Kuomintang reactionaries, the working people used their infinite wisdom to build many magnificent palaces and beautiful rivers, lakes, forests, and gardens. However, these were all enjoyed by the ruling classes of successive dynasties. Especially during the years of the Northern Warlords and Kuomintang rule, due to their wanton plundering, the city's appearance was dilapidated, historical sites were in disrepair for many years, public entertainment venues were few and narrow, and the streets were "three feet of dust without wind, and a street of mud with rain."

After liberation, the People's Government vigorously carried out municipal construction and rapidly changed the face of old Beijing. Newly built buildings totaled more than 18 million square meters, exceeding the total area of buildings built by previous dynasties since the Yuan Dynasty before liberation. Seven hundred kilometers of road surfaces were laid, more than doubling the old roads before liberation. In terms of urban water supply, 766 kilometers of pipelines were added, also equivalent to more than twice the original pipelines before liberation. In terms of public transportation, taking buses as an example, there were only five before liberation, and now there are 431. After liberation, ten new parks and twenty-four theaters and cinemas were also built. This has greatly improved the people's living, transportation, and environmental sanitation conditions. These many ironclad facts powerfully refuted the rightists' absurd claim that "the present is not as good as the past."

    新旧北京城
    有悠久历史和灿烂文化遗产的北京，从一千多年前辽代建都以来，经过元、明、清等王朝和北洋军阀、国民党反动统治，劳动人民以无穷的智慧建造了许多富丽的宫殿和优美的河湖林园，但是这些都为历代统治阶级所享用。特别是在北洋军阀和国民党统治的年代里，由于他们肆意掠夺，城市面貌破烂不堪，名胜古迹常年失修，公共娱乐场所又少又窄，街道是“无风三尺土，有雨一街泥”。
    解放后，人民政府大力进行市政建设，迅速改变了旧北京的面貌。新建的各种房屋有一千八百多万平方公尺，超过了解放前元朝以来历代所建房屋的总面积。铺设路面七百公里，比解放前旧有道路增加两倍多。城市供水方面，增加管道七百六十六公里，也相当于解放前原有管道的两倍多。公共交通工具方面，仅就公共汽车来说，解放前只有五辆，现在是四百三十一辆。解放后还新建了十座公园和二十四个剧影院。这使人民的居住、交通、环境卫生等条件有了很大的改善。这许多铁的事实，有力地回击了右派分子“今不如昔”的滥调。

    街道
    今日的右安门大街，马路两旁矗立起了一座座新的建筑物。看看解放前的右安门大街，多么荒凉。　　郑德鸿摄
    陶然亭
    陶然亭解放前是一潭死水。现在这个潭被挖成了二百八十多亩面积的湖，沿湖植树堆山，变成了风光绮丽的公园。       盛继润摄
    电车
    解放前在马路上行驶的只是有轨电车，而且十分破旧。现在在新铺的马路上行驶的是国产无轨电车。　　　楚　英摄
    龙须沟
    解放前，龙须沟两旁的劳动人民终年和污臭积水生活在一起。解放以后，把龙须沟填平了，成了风景美丽的地方。
