    The Divine Power of Hair
    In Bombay State, there is an Indian man whose hair possesses astonishing power. Not long ago, he used his hair to drag a State Transport Corporation bus for five hundred feet, with forty-five passengers on board. He used four rings attached to his hair to slide down a rope in the air for fifty feet. He can use a pulley hooked onto his hair to be pulled up to a height of one hundred feet.

    His name is Daulat Raoji Gaikwad, thirty years old, and an employee of the Indian State Transport Corporation. So far, he has not cut his hair, fearing he will lose its magic power. (Xinhua News Agency)

    头发的神力
    在孟买邦有一位印度人的头发具有惊人的力量。不久以前，他用头发拖着一辆国家运输公司的公共汽车走了五百英尺，车上还坐着四十五位乘客。他用四个环子扣住头发吊在一条绳子上在空中自上而下滑了五十英尺。他能够用一个吊轮扣住头发让自己被拉到一百英尺的高空。
    他的姓名是道拉特·劳吉·盖克瓦德，三十岁，是印度国家运输公司的一名雇员。到目前为止，他一直没有理过发，唯恐会失去头发的魔力。　（新华社）
