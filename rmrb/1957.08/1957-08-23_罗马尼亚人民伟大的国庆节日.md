　　The victorious armed uprising of August 23, 1944, organized and led by the Romanian Communist Party under the favorable conditions of the rapid advance of the Soviet army, marked a fundamental turning point in Romania's turbulent history, namely the transition from a bourgeois landlord regime to a people's regime. The armed uprising of August 23, 1944, was the prerequisite for the victory of the people's revolutionary struggle.

　　After completing the bourgeois democratic revolution—the first stage of the people's revolution, the Romanian people joyfully entered the second stage of this revolution—the stage of building socialism in our country. Our country has formulated two one-year plans for developing the national economy in 1949 and 1950, as well as two five-year plans for 1951-1955 and 1956-1960. These plans focus on developing the industry of production materials. In the thirteen years since liberation, Romania has transformed from a semi-colonial and backward agricultural country into a country with fully developed industry and agriculture.

　　Due to the completion of the first five-year plan, the total output value of the entire industry increased to 399% of that of 1938, and in the first year of the second five-year plan (1956), it reached 430%. The priority development of the means of production industry made the output of this sector in 1956 increase to 541% of that of 1938.

　　The machine manufacturing industry guarantees all the equipment needed by the domestic petroleum industry and can export part of its products. In order to better process crude oil, we have established new and modern equipment. The capacity for processing crude oil has increased from 3.5 million tons in 1947 to more than 11 million tons in 1956; during the same period, oil production increased from 3.85 million tons to 10,920,467 tons.

　　Currently, our country is building a biogas pipeline of about 600 kilometers in length, and major steel centers such as Hunedoara, Reşiţa, and other industrial areas are supplied with biogas through them.

　　We are determined to continue to implement the ten-year electrification plan. This year, we produced the equivalent of the electricity produced in the whole year of 1938 in just seventy-six days. In the chemical industry, the industries of agricultural fertilizers, pesticides, artificial fibers, plastics, artificial rubber, and fibers have been further developed.

　　The discovery of some abundant uranium mines has created conditions for the peaceful utilization of atomic energy. On July 31 this year, a 2,000-kilowatt atomic reactor was put into production and has recently reached its specified capacity.

　　The rapid development of industry has created a solid foundation for the development of agriculture. In 1956, agriculture had 32,160 tractors, 12,679 mechanical seeders, 9,224 mechanical harvesters, 6,854 mechanical harvester-binders, and 15,578 threshing machines. With the improvement of the level of agricultural mechanization, grain production has continued to grow.

　　Nevertheless, agricultural production still lags behind the development of industry and the ever-growing consumption needs of urban and rural workers. In order to solve this problem, the Party and the government have put forward the task of increasing agricultural output to 15 million tons during the second five-year plan. In order to accomplish this task, a series of measures have been implemented. The 1957 national budget stipulates that more appropriations should be given to agriculture and forestry, an amount twice as large as in 1951. The recent output of new chemical fertilizer factories is already sufficient to meet all agricultural needs. This will increase grain production to 5 million to 7 million tons. Starting from 1957, the compulsory sales system for vegetables and milk has been abolished, thereby increasing the enthusiasm of farmers to develop production.

　　The proportion of agricultural collectivization continues to grow. At present, the number of farmers joining agricultural cooperative units accounts for 28% of the total number of farmers and 41% of the national agricultural land area.

　　The Romanian people have also achieved significant achievements in culture, society, and improving the people's living standards. Illiteracy in our country was completely eliminated last year; all school-age children have received universal education, and the cultural station network is expanding. The Party and the government give special attention to scientific activities. These activities are concentrated in the Romanian People's Republic Academy of Sciences and its branches. Our country has so far established sixty-nine research institutes and design institutes, in which 6,300 people work.

　　A wide network of health stations (hospitals, joint clinics, clinics) has been established throughout the country, which has greatly reduced the mortality rate. The number of doctors has increased from 8,234 in 1938 to 22,000 in 1956.

　　The living standards of the working people have been significantly improved during the period of the people's democratic regime. During the first five-year plan (1951-1955), real wages increased by 28%. The plenary session of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party on December 27-29, 1956, decided to take new measures to further improve the living conditions of the working people. Our country has formulated a method to improve the wage system. This system is currently being discussed by all working people. Its implementation will increase workers' wages by an average of 15% this year.

　　In the cause of building a socialist and communist society, the Romanian Workers' Party follows the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism and has always learned from the extremely valuable historical experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the experience of other fraternal parties in the past and present. In all political and economic institutions of the people's democratic regime, the Party steadfastly implements the principle of democratic centralism, mobilizing more and more people to participate in the management of urban and rural administrative and socio-cultural departments, and directly participate in the management of state affairs.

　　The National Assembly elections held this year are a strong proof of the consolidation of the people's democratic system. According to the instructions of the December 1956 meeting of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, the National Assembly passed a series of decrees at the March 1957 meeting, which promoted the expansion of the legislative role of the highest state power organ, promoted the expansion of the powers and obligations of the executive committees of people's congresses at all levels, as well as ministers, bureau directors, and leaders of socialist enterprises, and promoted the more active participation of the working masses in the cause of building socialism.

　　The Romanian People's Republic pursues a policy of maintaining peace and cooperation with all countries.

　　The fundamental factor of our country's foreign policy is the fraternal friendship with the Soviet Union and People's China and other socialist countries. The solidarity among the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China is an unshakable foundation of peace, a major obstacle to imperialist war conspiracies, and a guarantee for our construction of socialism.

　　The Romanian People's Republic is determined to further develop fraternal friendship with socialist camp countries, unwaveringly defend the unbreakable great unity of the people of socialist countries, and fight against any attempts to shake our unity.

　　The Romanian people are sincerely happy about the more comprehensive and extensive development of friendly cooperation and mutual assistance between Romania and China. The visit of the Chinese Communist Party delegation headed by Comrade Zhu De to the Romanian People's Republic during the Second National Congress of the Romanian Workers' Party, the visit of the Romanian Workers' Party delegation headed by Comrade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej to the People's Republic of China during the Eighth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, and the mutual visits of parliamentary delegations of the two countries are particularly significant events that have deepened and developed the friendly relations between the people of Romania and China and exchanged opinions on various issues of socialist construction of the two peoples.

　　The trade relations between the Romanian People's Republic and the People's Republic of China have been developing year by year. The Romanian People's Republic exports petroleum and agricultural equipment, thermal power generation equipment, petroleum products, chemicals, etc. to the People's Republic of China; and imports rosin, antimony, tin, oils, leather, flax, silk fabrics, etc.

　　According to the scientific and technological cooperation agreement, the two countries are conducting exchanges on important materials and scientific data. Romanian experts have learned from China's rich experience in textile, paint manufacturing, pigments, crafts, bridge construction, etc.; at the same time, they have introduced their experience in the construction of petroleum industry, thermal power plants and chemical industry to Chinese workers.

　　Cultural exchanges between Romania and China are also becoming more and more active. The translation of the three volumes of selected works of Comrade Mao Zedong into Romanian is an event of particular value in our country's ideological and political aspects. In addition to Chinese political and scientific works, Romanian readers can also see works by Lu Xun, Guo Moruo, Mao Dun and other Chinese writers. At the same time, Chinese readers can also see the works of many great Romanian writers. Mutual visits and performances by art troupes from the two countries have also contributed to deepening the mutual understanding between the people of the two countries.

　　As a result of fraternal cooperation, starting this year, our country has published the Chinese version of the "Today Romania" pictorial magazine, introducing the current situation of life in Romania to Chinese readers.

　　The Romanian people cherish their fraternal friendship with the great Chinese people and are proud of this friendship. They hope that these relations will become closer and closer, thereby benefiting the people of our two countries and world peace.

　　罗马尼亚人民伟大的国庆节日
　　罗马尼亚人民共和国驻华大使　乔洛尤
    罗马尼亚共产党在苏联军队迅速进军的有利条件下所组织和领导的1944年8月23日的胜利的武装起义，标志着罗马尼亚动荡历史的根本转折点，即从资产阶级地主政权过渡到人民政权。1944年8月23日的武装起义是人民革命斗争胜利的前提。
    在完成了资产阶级民主革命——人民革命的第一阶段以后，罗马尼亚人民欢欣鼓舞地进入了这一革命的第二阶段——在我国建设社会主义的阶段。我国制定了发展国民经济的1949年和1950年的两个一年计划以及1951—1955年和1956—1960年的两个五年计划。这些计划的重点都放在发展生产资料的工业上。解放十三年来，罗马尼亚从一个半殖民地的和落后的农业国家，变成了一个具有充分发展的工农业的国家。
    由于第一个五年计划的完成，整个工业的总产量增加为1938年的399％，而在第二个五年计划的第一年里（1956年），达到了430％。生产资料工业的优先发展使得这个部门1956年的产量增加为1938年的541％。
    机器制造业保证了本国石油工业所需要的全部设备，并能输出一部分产品。为了更好地对原油进行加工，我们建立了新的现代化装备。对原油进行加工的容量从1947年的三百五十万吨增加到1956年的一千一百多万吨；在同一时期内，石油产量从三百八十五万吨增加到一千零九十二万零四百六十七吨。
    目前，我国正在建设长约六百公里的沼气管，主要钢铁中心如胡尼度拉、赖西察以及其他工业区都通过它们而得到沼气的供应。
    我们坚决地继续实现十年电气化计划。今年，我们仅在七十六天内就生产了相当于1938年全年生产的电力。在化学工业方面，农业肥料、杀虫剂、人造纤维、塑料、人造橡胶、纤维等工业都有了进一步的发展。
    一些蕴藏丰富的铀矿的发现，为和平利用原子能创造了条件。今年7月31日，二千瓩的原子反应堆投入了生产，最近已经达到了它的规定能力。
    工业的迅速发展为农业的发展创造了强固的基础。1956年，农业方面拥有三万二千一百六十台拖拉机、一万二千六百七十九台机械播种机、九千二百二十四台机械收割机、六千八百五十四台机械收割捆禾机、一万五千五百七十八台打谷机。随着农业机械化水平的提高，粮食产量不断地得到增长。
    尽管如此，农业生产还是落后于工业的发展，落后于城乡劳动人民日益增长的消费需要。为了解决这个问题，党和政府提出了在第二个五年计划期间把农业产量提高到一千五百万吨的任务。为了完成这一任务，一系列的措施已经付诸实行。1957年的国家预算规定给予农业和林业以更多的拨款，款额比1951年大一倍。新的制造化学肥料的工厂最近的产量，已经可以满足全部农业的需要。这将使粮食产量增加到五百万到七百万吨。从1957年开始，蔬菜和牛奶的义务交售制取消了，因而提高了农民发展生产的积极性。
    农业合作化部分的比重不断地增长，目前，加入农业合作化单位的农户占农户总数的28％，占全国农业用地面积的41％。
    罗马尼亚人民在文化、社会以及提高人民生活水平方面也获得了重大成就。我国的文盲已于去年全部扫除；所有学龄儿童都接受了普遍教育，文化站网正在扩大。党和政府对科学活动给予特别的关心。这种活动都集中在罗马尼亚人民共和国科学院及其分院，我国到目前为止已经建立了六十九个研究所和设计所，在其中工作的有六千三百人。
    全国已经设有广泛的卫生站网（医院、联合门诊所、诊疗所），这一情况使得死亡率大大降低。医生已经从1938年的八千二百三十四名增加为1956年的二万二千名。
    劳动人民的生活水平在人民民主政权的时期得到了显著的提高。在第一个五年计划（1951—1955年）期间，实际工资增加了28％。罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会1956年12月27—29日全体会议，决定采取新的措施，以进一步改善劳动人民的生活条件。我国已经制订了一项改进工资制度的办法。目前这个制度正交给全体劳动人民讨论。它的实施将使工人今年的工资平均增加15％。
    罗马尼亚工人党在建设社会主义和共产主义社会的事业中，遵循着马克思列宁主义的学说，在过去和现在一直学习苏联共产党极其宝贵的历史经验以及其他兄弟党的经验。在人民民主政权的全部政治和经济机构里，党坚定不移地执行民主集中的原则，动员愈来愈多的群众参加城乡行政和社会文化部门的管理，直接参加国家事务的管理。
    今年举行的国民议会选举是人民民主制度巩固的有力证明。根据罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会1956年12月会议的指示，国民议会在1957年3月会议上，通过了一系列的法令，这些法令促使最高国家权力机关的立法作用得到扩大，促使各级人民会议执行委员会以及各部长、局长和社会主义企业领导者的权力和义务得到扩大，促使劳动群众更加积极地参加建设社会主义的事业。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国执行与一切国家维护和平并进行合作的政策。
    我国对外政策的根本因素是与苏联和人民中国及其他社会主义国家兄弟般的友谊。以苏联和中华人民共和国为首的社会主义阵营各国间的团结是和平的不可动摇的基础，是帝国主义战争阴谋的主要障碍，是我们建设社会主义的保障。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国有决心为进一步发展与社会主义阵营各国的兄弟般的友谊、坚定不移地为保卫社会主义各国人民的牢不可破的伟大团结、反对任何动摇我们团结的企图而斗争。
    罗马尼亚人民对罗中两国之间的友好合作和互助关系的更加全面而广泛的发展衷心地感到高兴。在罗马尼亚工人党举行第二次全国代表大会时以朱德同志为首的中国共产党代表团的访问罗马尼亚人民共和国，中国共产党举行第八次代表大会时以乔治乌—德治同志为首的罗马尼亚工人党代表团访问中华人民共和国以及两国议会代表团的相互访问，是加深和发展罗中两国人民的友好关系和就两国人民建设社会主义各项问题交换意见的特别重大事件。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国和中华人民共和国之间的贸易关系逐年得到发展。罗马尼亚人民共和国向中华人民共和国输出石油和农业设备、火力发电设备、石油产品、化学品等等；输入松香、锑、锡、油类、皮革、麻类、丝织品等等。
    根据科学技术合作协定，两国正在进行关于重要材料和科学资料的交换。罗马尼亚专家学习了中国在纺织、制造油漆、颜料、工艺、桥梁建筑等方面的丰富经验；同时向中国工人介绍了他们在建设石油工业、火力发电站和化学工业方面的经验。
    罗中两国的文化交流也愈来愈活跃了。毛泽东同志的三卷选集的译成罗马尼亚文，是对我国思想、政治方面具有特别价值的事件。除了中国的政治和科学著作之外，罗马尼亚读者还能看到鲁迅、郭沫若、茅盾及其他中国作家的作品。与此同时，中国读者也能看到罗马尼亚许多伟大作家的作品。两国艺术团体的互相访问演出，也对加深两国人民的彼此了解作出了贡献。
    作为兄弟般合作的结果，从今年起，我国出版了中文版的“今日罗马尼亚”画报，向中国读者介绍目前罗马尼亚生活的情形。
    罗马尼亚人民非常珍视他们与伟大的中国人民的兄弟般的友谊关系，并因这种友谊关系而感到骄傲。他们希望这些关系能够愈来愈密切，从而有利于我们两国人民和全世界的和平。
