Being a Socialist College Student
    —Important Lessons from the Anti-Rightist Struggle at Peking University
    Zhou Dingfang, Zhu Xueke
    After more than two months of mass anti-Rightist struggle, the students of Peking University have received a profound education and reached a common understanding: it is necessary to raise socialist consciousness, strengthen political study, and stand firmly on the proletarian stand in order to be a socialist college student.

        Sturdy Grass in a Gale
    In May, Rightist elements Tan Tianrong, Long Yinghua, and others began to launch attacks on the Party, using the banner of helping the Party rectify its work style, trafficking in large quantities of bourgeois revisionist goods, attacking the Party, and provoking class struggle.
    In this struggle, every student, especially Party and League members and socialist activists among the masses, was severely tested. Among them, apart from a few individuals who could not stand firm on the proletarian stand in the face of the rampant attacks of the Rightist elements, could not distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, and were passive and wavering, some Party and League members even defected to the enemy and betrayed the Party. However, the vast majority of Party and League members and socialist activists withstood the test of this struggle. For every big-character poster posted by the Rightist elements, they posted ten or twenty big-character posters to expose and refute them. When the Rightist elements attempted to publish reactionary publications such as "Guangchang" ("The Plaza"), they published more revolutionary publications such as "Lang Taosha" ("Waves Wash the Sand"), "Wuyue" ("May"), "Zhengming" ("Contention"), "Zhu Mu Niao" ("Woodpecker"), "Luntan" ("Forum"), and "Sixiang Zhanxian" ("Ideological Front") to encircle and suppress it. The Rightist elements set up forums everywhere in the square, spreading rumors and slanders, and they immediately went on stage to refute them. When the Rightist elements met their opponents at one forum, they shifted their position to another forum, and they followed and pursued them.
    The Chinese Department, where the core Rightist elements of the entire school were concentrated (the core organization of the Rightist elements of the entire school, the "Guangchang" editorial board, consisted of fifteen people including Tan Tianrong, Long Yinghua, Liu Qidi, Zhang Yuanxun, Shen Zeyi, Chen Fengxiao, Zhang Jingzhong, and Ye Yüsheng, of whom six were from the Chinese Department), under the leadership of the Party and League members, all the students in the department actively took action and launched a struggle against the Rightist elements. The Class Two of the third grade, where "Guangchang" editor-in-chief Zhang Yuanxun was located, was the class with the most successful ideological work in the past, and had won the honorary title of advanced collective twice in a row every year. After Zhang Yuanxun posted the first reactionary big-character poster and gave the first inflammatory speech in the square, all the Party and League members immediately saw through his conspiracy and mobilized all the students in the class to write and post the first big-character poster to counterattack the Rightist elements. When the Rightist elements in the whole school were most rampant and the masses were ideologically confused, Zhang Yuanxun stood high on the podium, showing his hideous face, and shouted: "'Bureaucrats', I want to eat you like a wolf! 'Defenders', who dares to come on stage to debate?" The Party and League member Zhu Baoquan and others in the class stepped forward and went on stage to expose his reactionary face. Shen Tianyou, the secretary of the League branch, was the first to confront Zhang Yuanxun face-to-face at the first anti-Rightist debate in the class, systematically exposing and criticizing his reactionary words and deeds. When Zhang Yuanxun was exposed and criticized by everyone and became angry, and threatened to "meet with knives," the students were not intimidated by his threats, but launched a more intense battle. A total of nine large-scale criticism meetings were held in the class before and after, and he was exposed and criticized in front of the masses, revealing his true colors. In order to promote the development of the struggle in the whole school, they also went to other departments and classes to expose Zhang's absurd remarks.
    At the debate meetings, at the criticism meetings, and in all occasions of verbal and written battles, batches of excellent warriors on the ideological front, who were combat-effective, good at reasoning, and good at mastering strategies and tactics, continued to emerge from various departments.

    The Middle Masses Turn to the Left in the Struggle
    In such a heated struggle, some of the middle masses, because they had only focused on studying their professional work in the past, did not pay attention to political study, were not clear about the current domestic and international situation, and had all kinds of confused ideas. They went through a very complex process when they joined the struggle. In the early stage of the struggle, some of them regarded this struggle as irrelevant to themselves and adopted a wait-and-see attitude. While others were fighting fiercely with the Rightist elements, they sat in the library all day long. Although some people walked from the room to the square, they were ideologically confused under the attack of the Rightist elements due to their vague stand. Until the mass counterattack against the Rightist struggle had fully unfolded in society and in the school, they were still standing there watching, wondering if it was "making a mountain out of a molehill?" Some people blindly echoed because they did not recognize the conspiracy of the Rightist elements.
    Student Cheng had always buried himself in studying his professional work. Even after the anti-Rightist struggle began, he still went to the library early and returned late. He adopted the position of an "onlooker" towards the struggle. However, he could not escape the influence of the struggle no matter what. Every day he went back and forth to the library or went to the dining hall to eat, the red and green big-character posters posted on the walls around the square attracted him to browse through them; many of the opposing questions raised on the big-character posters made him consider them; he may or may not have participated in the debate meetings in the square until the end, but he had to participate in the class meetings to struggle against the Rightist elements. The struggle attracted him, educated him, and after accepting everyone's criticism, he reviewed his mistakes of not caring about the struggle and being divorced from reality, and actively joined the struggle.
    Wang Zhecheng and the Rightist element Zhang Yuanxun were "poetry friends." Since the vast number of students launched a struggle against Zhang, his own ideological struggle also became acute and complex. Should he stand on the side of the Rightist elements and maintain private friendship? Or should he stand on the side of the people and draw a clear line with the Rightist elements? It was not until the students in the class held the second criticism meeting against Zhang Yuanxun, thoroughly exposing Zhang Yuanxun's reactionary words and deeds, and all the students in the class drew a clear line with Zhang and actively joined the struggle, that he finally made up his mind and realized that true friendship should be built on a common revolutionary political foundation, and he resolutely stood on the side of the people.
    In the departments where the anti-Rightist struggle developed relatively slowly, the students were influenced and educated after the counterattack against the Rightist struggle was launched throughout the school, and they also raised their awareness and clarified various confused ideas. The second-year students of the Physics Department, because the struggle was developing relatively slowly, after Lin Xiling, a Rightist element from Renmin University of China, came to Peking University to "set fire," when the Rightist elements in the school shouted "Save the children, 'Guangchang' is having a difficult birth," they were moved by "compassion" and helped the Rightist elements to mimeograph, so that this clump of weeds finally grew out of the soil. However, since the students of the whole school conducted continuous criticism and exposure of the Rightist elements Lin Xiling, Tan Tianrong, etc., they realized that in the face of the acute class struggle, anyone who left the Party by an inch or a point was getting closer to the Rightist elements by an inch or a point. All 181 students in the grade also jointly wrote a declaration of war drawing a clear line with the Rightist elements and immediately took action.

    The Working Class's Firm Stand Gave the Students Great Education
    In the entire struggle process, the firm stand shown by the working class had a great educational significance for the students of the whole school. Many students were not clear about the reactionary remarks spread by the Rightist elements using big-character posters. However, when the Rightist elements selected and compiled these things as the content of the first issue of "Guangchang" and sent them to the Beijing No. 1 Printing Factory for printing, the typesetters were stimulated by its reactionary smell as soon as they got the manuscript. From the night shift to the day shift, no one could typeset it. Finally, the workers of the whole factory decided to refuse to print this reactionary publication and immediately reported the incident to the Student Union of Peking University. The workers' cultural level is not as high as that of the college students, so why could they immediately discover the problem? In contrast, everyone realized that they lacked a clear proletarian stand and had a dull political sense.
    Wu Nanshan, a student of the Chinese Department, only buried himself in studying at school and relaxed the cultivation of political thought, so he was not clear about many issues. Since hearing about the actions of the workers of the Beijing No. 1 Printing Factory and seeing the performance of Li Wanchun and other students from working-class backgrounds in the anti-Rightist struggle, he felt very ashamed and deeply moved. He posted a big-character poster, sincerely expressing "to take workers as teachers" and actively joined the struggle.
    The Rightist elements who appeared among the students of Peking University were mostly from landlord and capitalist families. They had not seriously accepted ideological transformation in the past, and even resisted ideological transformation and insisted on their reactionary stand, so they all showed their true colors in this storm.

        Thoroughly Transform Ideology
    Although the mass anti-Rightist struggle at Peking University has come to an end, this struggle has not ended. The entire struggle will be a long-term one.
    After the struggle in the previous period, every student, in connection with their own situation, thought about why they had ignored the reality that class struggle still existed? Why were they not vigilant? Why was their stand unstable? Why were they deceived by the Rightist elements? … Everyone unanimously realized that the root cause was related to their class origin and neglect of ideological transformation, and they were determined to strengthen political and ideological training. According to the statistics of 1956, the proportion of workers and peasants among the students of the whole school only accounted for 22%, while those from exploiting class backgrounds such as landlords and capitalists and from the upper petty bourgeoisie such as freelance professionals accounted for more than 70%. And in the classes enrolled before 1954, the proportion of students from exploiting class backgrounds was even greater. The students generally requested the school to take concrete measures to strengthen political and ideological education and strengthen political courses. Many students in the science and foreign language departments, who were not interested in Marxism-Leninism in the past, also paid attention to it after this struggle. At the beginning of the summer vacation, many people formulated their own plans for studying Marxism-Leninism and participating in physical labor. Wu Nanshan was not clear about the important significance of taking political courses in the past. When the Rightist elements clamored and incited students to cancel political courses, he was influenced and advocated that political courses should be elective. After this struggle, he felt that the school's political courses should not only not be reduced, but should be strengthened and improved. His home is in Shanghai, and in order to participate in physical labor and get close to the working masses, he planned to spend most of his vacation in the rural areas of Zhejiang at his grandmother's house to participate in agricultural labor.
    The students who stayed at the school spent some time on political study and some participated in physical labor. More than 600 of them participated in voluntary labor to beautify the school grounds and also prepared to go to agricultural cooperatives or factories outside the school to work. Shi Meiheng and others, first-year students of the Philosophy Department, organized a "earthwork group" of ten students on the third day of the summer vacation and participated in the work of digging and carrying earth on the school construction site like the workers and received the same wages as the workers. They used their labor remuneration to buy books such as "A Concise History of Philosophy" to strengthen their political study.

　　做一个社会主义的大学生
　　——北京大学反右派斗争中的重要教训
　　周定舫　朱学科
    经过了两个多月群众性的反右派斗争，北京大学学生受到了深刻
  的教育，也得到了共同的认识：必须提高社会主义觉悟，加强政治学习，站稳无产阶级的立场，才能做个社会主义的大学生。
        疾风中的劲草
    5月里，右派分子谭天荣、龙英华等开始向党发起进攻，打着帮助党整风的招牌，大量贩运资产阶级修正主义的货色，向党进攻，挑起阶级斗争。
    在这一场斗争中，每一个学生特别是党团员和群众中的社会主义积极分子，都受到了严重的考验。他们之中除去有个别人，在右派分子猖狂进攻中站不稳无产阶级立场，分不清敌我，消极动摇，有的党团员甚至投敌叛变。但绝大多数党团员及社会主义积极分子，都经得起这一场斗争的考验。右派分子每贴出一张大字报，他们就贴出了十张、二十张的大字报来揭露和驳斥。右派分子企图出版“广场”等反动刊物，他们就出版“浪淘沙”、“五月”、“争鸣”、“啄木鸟”、“论坛”、“思想战线”等更多的革命刊物，对它展开围攻。右派分子在广场上到处设立讲坛，大事造谣诬蔑，他们即登坛驳斥。右派分子在这一讲坛遇到对手，转移阵地站到另一讲坛，他们就跟踪追击。
    全校右派骨干分子集中的中文系（全校右派分子的核心组织“广场”编委会，为谭天荣、龙英华、刘奇弟、张元勋、沈泽宜、陈奉孝、张景中、叶于泩等十五人组成，中文系即有六人），在党团员的带动下，全系同学都积极行动起来，和右派分子展开斗争。“广场”主编张元勋所在的三年级二班，过去是思想工作做得最有成绩的班，曾一年一度的连获两次先进集体的荣誉称号。全体党团员在张元勋贴出第一张反动大字报，在广场作第一次煽动性的演讲以后，即识破他的阴谋，发动全班同学写贴第一张反击右派的大字报。当全校右派分子活动最猖狂，群众思想混乱的时候，张元勋高踞讲坛，现出他那一副狰狞面孔，大喊：“‘官僚主义者’，我要像狼一样的吃掉你！‘卫道者’谁敢上台来辩论”时，班里的党团员朱保全等就挺身而出，上台去揭露其反动面目。团支部书记沈天佑在班里反右派的第一次辩论会上，即第一个和张元勋面对面的交锋，系统地揭发批判张的反动言行。张元勋被大家揭发得恼羞成怒，声言要以“刀子相见”时，同学们不但没有为他的威胁所吓倒，并且更加激烈地展开战斗。全班前后共召开了九次批判他的大会，在群众面前把他揭发批判得原形毕露。为了推动全校斗争的开展，他们还到外系外班去揭发张的荒谬言论。
    在辩论会上，在批判会上，在所有舌战和笔战的场合，各系都不断地涌现出成批的富有战斗力，长于说理，又善于掌握战略战术的思想战线上的优秀战士。
    中间群众在斗争中向左转
    在这样火热的斗争中，有些中间群众，由于他们过去只专心研究业务，不重视政治学习，对当前国内外形势不清楚，存在各式各样的糊涂思想。他们投入斗争，经过了一个很复杂的过程。在斗争初期，他们之中有些人把这一场斗争看成与自己无关，抱着隔岸观火的态度。别人和右派分子斗争得非常剧烈，他们整天整日的坐图书馆。有一些人虽然由室内走到广场，但由于立场模糊，在右派分子的袭击下，思想混乱，直到社会上和学校里群众性反击右派斗争已经全面展开，他们还停着脚步在那里观望，怀疑是否“小题大做”？有的人因不识右派分子的阴谋，还盲目的随声附和。
    学生成立一向埋头钻研业务，直到反右派斗争展开以后，他仍然是早出晚归的坐图书馆。他对斗争抱着“旁观者”的立场。但是，他无论如何脱离不了斗争的影响。每天他往返图书馆或是到饭厅去吃饭，广场四周墙壁上贴得红红绿绿的大字报，吸引着他不得不去浏览一番；大字报上提出很多的正反面针锋相对的问题，他看了不得不加以考虑；广场上的辩论会，他或者参加，或者不一定参加到底，但是班里斗争右派分子的会，是不得不参加的。斗争吸引着他，教育着他，他接受大家的批评以后，检讨了自己不关心斗争和脱离实际的错误，积极地投入斗争。
    王浙成和右派分子张元勋是“诗友”。自广大同学对张展开斗争以后，他自己的思想斗争也跟着尖锐和复杂起来。站在右派分子一边，维护私人的友谊呢？还是站在人民的一边，与右派分子划清界限呢？直到班里同学对张元勋开了第二次批判会，对张元勋的反动言行进行了彻底揭发，全班同学都与张划清界限并积极投入斗争以后，他才下定决心，认识到真正的友谊，应当建立在共同的革命的政治基础上，他即坚决的站到人民一边来。
    在反右派斗争开展得比较缓慢的系级，同学们在全校反击右派斗争展开以后，受到影响和教育，也都提高了觉悟，澄清了种种糊涂思想。物理系二年级学生，因为斗争开展得比较缓慢，自中国人民大学右派分子林希翎到北京大学“放火”以后，校内右派分子大喊“救救孩子，‘广场’在难产中”的时候，他们又动了“恻隐之心”的去帮右派分子们油印，使这丛毒草终于长出土来。但是，自全校同学对右派分子林希翎、谭天荣等进行连续的批判揭发以后，他们认识到在尖锐的阶级斗争的形势下，任何人只要离开了党一寸一分，就是向右派分子靠近了一寸一分。全级一百八十一个学生还联名写了一张与右派分子划清界限的宣战书，马上行动起来。
    工人阶级的坚定立场给学生们很大教育
    在整个斗争过程中，工人阶级所表现的坚定的立场，对全校学生的教育意义很大。很多同学对右派分子利用大字报所散播的反动言论认识不清。可是，右派分子把这些东西选编起来作为“广场”的第一期内容，送到北京市印刷一厂去付印时，排字工人们把稿子一拿到手，就受到它反动气味的刺激，从夜班传到日班，没有一个人能排下去。最后，全厂工人决定拒绝承印这份反动刊物，并立刻向北京大学学生会揭发这件事。工人的文化水平并不如大学生们高，为什么能够马上就发现问题呢？相形之下，大家都认识到自己缺乏明确的无产阶级立场，政治嗅觉迟钝。
    中文系学生吴南山，在校只顾埋头读书，放松了政治思想的锻炼，对很多问题认识不清。自从听到北京市印刷一厂工人行动的情况，看了校内工人出身的李万春等同学在反右派斗争中的表现，他感到很惭愧，感触很深。他贴了一张大字报，衷心地表示“要拜工人为师”，并积极投入斗争。
    北京大学学生中出现的右派分子，绝大部分都是出身于地主、资产阶级家庭。他们过去没有认真接受思想改造，甚至抗拒思想改造，坚持反动立场，所以在这次风浪中都现了原形。
        彻底改造思想
    北京大学群众性的反右派斗争虽已告一段落，但这一斗争并未结束。整个斗争将是长期的。
    经过前一时期的斗争，每个同学联系到自己的情况，想到为什么漠视了当前还存在阶级斗争的现实？为什么警惕性不高？为什么立场不稳？为什么受了右派分子的蒙蔽？……大家一致认识到归根到底是同自己的阶级出身和忽视思想改造有关，都下决心要加强政治思想锻炼。根据1956年的统计，全校学生中的工农成份，只占22％，而地主、资本家等剥削阶级出身以及自由职业者等上层小资产阶级出身的人即占到70％以上。而在1954年以前招生的班级，剥削阶级出身的学生比例则占的更大。同学们普遍要求学校采取具体措施以加强政治思想教育，加强政治课。理科和外文各系的学生，有很多人在过去对马列主义不感兴趣，经过这一场斗争以后，也重视了起来。在暑假开始时，有很多人都制定出自己学习马列主义和参加体力劳动的计划。吴南山过去对上政治课的重要意义认识不清，当右派分子叫嚣和煽动同学取消政治课的时候，他受到影响，主张政治课要选修。经过这场斗争以后，他感到学校的政治课不但不能削减，而且应该加强和改进。他的家在上海，他为了参加体力劳动，和劳动群众接近，计划绝大部分假期时间，去浙江农村他外婆家去参加农业劳动。
    留校的学生，有的抽空进行政治学习，有的参加体力劳动。他们有六百多人参加校内美化校院的义务劳动，还准备到校外农业社或工厂去劳动。哲学系一年级学生史美珩等，在暑假开始的第三天，即组织十个同学为一“土方小组”，和工人们同样的参加校内工地上挖土挑土的劳动，并和工人同样的领取工资。他们把自己劳动的报酬，买回“哲学史简编”等书籍，加强政治学习。
