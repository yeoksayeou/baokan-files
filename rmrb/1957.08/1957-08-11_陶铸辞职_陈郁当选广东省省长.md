Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 10th - Chen Yu, the current Minister of Coal Industry and member of the CCP Central Committee, was elected Governor of Guangdong Province at the sixth session of the First People's Congress of Guangdong Province, which closed today. Prior to the supplementary election, the former Governor of Guangdong Province, Tao Zhu, submitted his resignation to the congress and it was approved.

Tao Zhu presented the reason for resigning from the post of Governor of Guangdong Province to the Provincial People's Congress, stating that because he also holds the positions of First Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the CCP and Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the CPPCC, he has felt deeply burdened by concurrently serving as Governor for the past three years. Furthermore, the work in Guangdong Province will remain extremely complex and arduous in the future, and it is necessary to have a dedicated Governor to better assume the responsibilities of the Provincial People's Committee.

At this meeting, the delegates also re-elected Lin Qiangyun, the current Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions and member of the Standing Committee of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the CCP, as Vice Governor of Guangdong Province. Before the re-election, Vice Governor He Ximing resigned to the congress with approval because he was transferred to work in another province. Lin Qiangyun formerly served as a member of the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee, and Xu Xiangong, professor of Zhongshan University and Deputy Director of Academic Affairs, and Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Guangzhou Branch of the Jiusan Society, has been elected to fill the position.

    陶铸辞职
    陈郁当选广东省省长
    新华社广州10日电　现任煤炭工业部部长、中共中央委员陈郁，在今天闭幕的广东省第一届人民代表大会第六次会议上被补选为广东省省长。补选以前，原任广东省省长陶铸向大会提出辞职，并获得大会同意。
    陶铸向省人民代表大会提出辞去广东省省长职务的理由是他因担任中共广东省委第一书记和政协广东省委员会主席职务，三年来兼任省长已深感任务繁重，而广东省的工作今后仍极复杂艰巨，必须有专任省长才能把省人民委员会的责任更好地担负起来。
    这次会议上，代表们还补选了现任广东省工会联合会主席、中共广东省委常务委员林锵云为广东省副省长。补选前副省长贺希明因调往别省工作，向大会辞职获得同意。林锵云原任广东省人民委员会委员一职，已补选中山大学教授兼副教务长、九三学社广州分社筹委会主任委员徐贤恭担任。
