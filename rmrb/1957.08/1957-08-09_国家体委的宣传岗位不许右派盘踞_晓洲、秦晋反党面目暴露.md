    The National Sports Commission's Propaganda Positions Must Not Be Occupied by Rightists
    Xiao Zhou and Qin Jin Exposed as Anti-Party Elements
    (Our Newspaper) The National Sports Commission has exposed two rightist elements, one is Xiao Zhou, the head of the Propaganda Section, and the other is Qin Jin, the editor of the "Sports Literature Series."
    Rightist Xiao Zhou (formerly known as Liu Yuanbin), after joining the Party, frequently resisted the leadership of the Party and the instructions of his superiors, and was hostile to the brilliant achievements of socialist construction. He said that some of the statistical materials published in the newspapers were "self-consolation of bureaucrats." Xiao Zhou greatly attacked and slandered the National Sports Commission. He clamored that the Party was an amateur, uneducated, and unable to lead the work of the Sports Commission. He said that the work of the Sports Commission has been a mess for several years. He also spread the vicious argument of "dissolving after the rectification."
    Xiao Zhou also used the records of the forums held by sports circles during the "blooming and contending" period to write a sensational article in "New Sports" entitled "Heard from Several Forums", concentrating the wrong opinions of some people in the sports circles, and releasing poisonous arrows such as "the sports policy only stays on paper," "implementing dogmatism with commandism," and "some national competitions are essentially held for a few teams," to attack the leadership of the National Sports Commission and echo the rightist elements in society. During the rectification campaign, he also took the initiative to talk to people, collect materials, and help a person who had been expelled from the Party for his bad political quality to counterattack the Party.
    Xiao Zhou also had extensive contacts with rightist elements in society such as Pu Xixiu, Lü Wen, Wu Zuguang, and Huang Sha. In order to set up a fellow journal that "does not need Party leadership and is not affiliated with the institution" and publishes social news such as divorce and seduction, he actively planned funding and manpower, and carried out a series of activities.
    Rightist Qin Jin was a member of the Kuomintang in the past. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, he worked in the Beijing Kuomintang Municipal Party Headquarters. Later, he served as the Northwest Correspondent and military and political reporter for the Yishibao, writing many articles that slandered the Communist Party. Now he is a member of the Jiusan Society.
    During the "blooming and contending" period, Qin Jin incited people everywhere, inciting the masses to be dissatisfied with the leadership. He described the shortcomings of individual leading cadres of the Sports Publishing House as "worms grow only after things rot." He viciously used some cadres' dissatisfaction with housing and wrote inflammatory big-character posters. He also recommended some rightist remarks from society to his group members and praised them repeatedly.

    国家体委的宣传岗位不许右派盘踞
    晓洲、秦晋反党面目暴露
    本报讯　国家体育运动委员会已经揭发出两个右派分子，一个是宣传科科长晓洲，另一个是“体育文丛”编辑秦晋。
    右派分子晓洲（原名刘元宾）入党后，经常抗拒党的领导和上级的指示，仇视社会主义建设的辉煌成就，他说报上发表的一些数字材料都是“官僚主义者的自我安慰”。晓洲大肆攻击和污蔑国家体委。他叫嚣党是外行，不学无术，不能领导体委的工作。几年来体委的工作是一团漆黑。还散布“整完散伙”的恶毒论调。
    晓洲还利用体育界鸣放座谈会的记录，在“新体育”写了一篇题为“从几次座谈会上听来的”煽动性的文章，集中了一些体育界人士的错误意见，放出了“体育方针只停在纸面上”，“用命令主义推行教条主义”，“有些全国性的竞赛，实质是为几个代表队举行的”的毒箭，向国家体委的领导上大肆攻击，和社会上的右派分子相呼应。在整风期间，他还主动地找人谈话，收集材料，帮助一个因政治品质恶劣被开除党籍的人向党反攻。
    晓洲还与社会上的右派分子浦熙修、吕文、吴祖光、黄沙等有广泛的联系。他为了筹办一张“不要党领导，不带机关性的”刊登离婚、诱奸等社会新闻的同人报，积极筹划经费和人力，进行了一系列的活动。
    右派分子秦晋过去是国民党党员，抗战胜利后曾在北京国民党市党部工作，后来担任益世报西北特派员、军事政治记者，写了不少污蔑共产党的文章。现在他是九三学社社员。
    在鸣放中，秦晋到处点火，煽动群众对领导上不满。他将体育出版社个别领导干部的缺点说成是“物必自腐而后虫生”。他恶毒地利用一些干部对住房的不满，写了煽动性的大字报。他还将社会上的一些右派言论推荐给组内同志看，并连声夸奖。
