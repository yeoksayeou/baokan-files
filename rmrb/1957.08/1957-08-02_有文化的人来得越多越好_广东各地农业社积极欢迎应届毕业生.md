The More Cultured People, The Better
Agricultural Cooperatives in Various Parts of Guangdong Actively Welcome Recent Graduates

(Our Newspaper News) Comprehensive report from *Southern Daily*: Many agricultural production cooperatives in various parts of Guangdong are now also actively preparing to welcome recent middle and primary school graduates back to their hometowns to engage in agricultural production. Some agricultural cooperatives, in addition to preparing to arrange for graduates from their own villages, also welcome educated youth from other villages to join the cooperative and become the first generation of cultured farmers.

Twelve cooperatives in the suburbs of Shiqi City, Zhongshan County, have made specific arrangements, preparing to absorb a total of 316 middle and primary school graduates. In addition to arranging for these students to participate in agricultural or sideline labor, each agricultural cooperative will also assign them to concurrently serve as mass teachers, technicians, club cadres, and other positions, according to their specialties and interests. The Guihu Township Agricultural Cooperative in Chao'an is sparsely populated with few educated youth. This year, Guihu Township has twelve recent senior high school graduates, twenty-three junior high school graduates, and a group of senior primary school graduates. In addition to preparing to arrange for them to join the cooperative, the cooperative also requests that 150 to 200 graduates from other places join their agricultural cooperative.

Many agricultural cooperatives are also actively trying to prepare graduates for participation in production. The Changzhou Agricultural Cooperative in Zhongshan County has already designated technicians and experienced members to explain production knowledge to graduates and help them learn production techniques. It has also allocated funds to purchase labor tools so that each graduate who joins the cooperative has tools such as hoes, rakes, and sickles to use. Some members are also preparing to repair basketball courts and clubs to allow graduates to organize recreational activities for members during their spare time.

Recently, many graduating middle school students in Guangzhou have automatically contacted rural agricultural production cooperatives, preparing to go to the countryside to participate in agricultural production when they fail to enter higher-level schools.

    有文化的人来得越多越好
    广东各地农业社积极欢迎应届毕业生
    本报讯　综合南方日报消息：广东各地许多农业生产合作社现在也正在积极准备欢迎应届中、小学毕业生回乡从事农业生产。有的农业社除了准备安排本乡应届毕业生以外，还表示欢迎外乡的知识青年入社当第一代有文化的农民。
    中山县石岐市郊有十二个社作了具体安排，一共准备吸收三百一十六个中、小学毕业生。各农业社除了准备分配这些学生参加农业劳动或副业劳动以外，还将根据他们的特长和兴趣，分配他们兼任群众教师、技术员、俱乐部干部等职务。潮安归湖乡农业社地多人少、知识青年十分缺乏。归湖乡今年有十二个应届高中毕业生、二十三个初中毕业生和一批高小毕业生。该社除了准备将他们安排入社以外，还要求外地能有一百五十名到二百名毕业生加入他们的农业社。
    许多农业社还积极设法为毕业生做好参加生产的准备工作。中山县长洲农业社已经指定技术员和有丰富经验的社员，对毕业生讲解生产知识，帮助他们学习生产技术，并且拨款购置劳动工具，使每个入社的毕业生都有锄头、?、禾镰等工具使用。一些社员还准备修好篮球场和俱乐部，让毕业生在工余组织社员开展文娱活动。
    最近，广州市有不少应届中学毕业生自动同乡村农业生产合作社联系，准备在考不上高一级的学校的时候，就下乡参加农业生产。
