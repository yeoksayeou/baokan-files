    Black-hearted "Virtuous Man" - Miao Chunsen
    The anti-Party face of Miao Chunsen, Deputy Director of the Baotou City Commercial Bureau, representative of the Municipal People's Congress, and member of the Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, has been exposed.
    Miao Chunsen came from a landlord family and was a reactionary officer before liberation. After liberation, the people forgave him and gave him a fairly high position, but he insisted on being an enemy of the people. In 1950, when the people's government suppressed bandits, he privately sold a pistol, which ended up in the hands of the bandits. The people's government explicitly prohibited smoking and drug use, but he sold privately hidden opium. Before the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, he took advantage of his position as Deputy Director of the Industry and Commerce Bureau to engage in illegal activities with unscrupulous private merchants and accepted bribes from them. He often took the position of the capitalists to deal with labor-capital disputes in private enterprises. For a long time, he used writing poetry as a pastime and said: "We are not as good as the past, the future is not as good as the present, and we live worse every day."
    Like all right-wingers, when the national right-wingers launched a frenzied attack on the Party, he suddenly became "active." He believed that this was "the first ideological liberation since the founding of the country." He said that Chu Anping's "Party's world" statement was "a hit that struck the key point," and that Ge Peiqi's desire to kill communists was "good" and "dared to speak." He also went to various departments to solicit opinions about dissatisfaction with the Party, saying: "We democratic people have an effect when we speak, and I will reflect any opinions you have." Later, at the symposium of non-Party people convened by the Municipal Party Committee and other meetings, under the guise of "sincere communication," he quoted classics and used ancient metaphors to attack the Party. He said: "From various units to the central government, a doorkeeper is placed everywhere. It is truly 'Under heaven, there is no land that is not the sovereign's.'" He slandered the Party as a sectarian group and the Party organization as a "power gate." He said, "A new emperor has new courtiers," and "It's good to have someone in the court to be an official." He also said: "The most serious sectarianism is strong Party spirit." "Under the suppression of sectarianism, sugar-coated bullets are easily accepted, and honest advice is unpleasant to the ears." "Under the suppression of sectarianism, Party members are close and intimate, while the masses are respectful and distant. Those who are close are candid, while those who are distant do not communicate their feelings. The good and bad of non-Party people depend solely on a Party member's report; a red report means red, and a white report means white. Even individual people of bad character use despicable means to sell out comrades as capital for their own advancement, and leaders inevitably listen to one side."
    Miao Chunsen was in charge of four important departments in the Commercial Bureau: price, finance and accounting, infrastructure, and business. Section chiefs and staff in the bureau, whether Party members or non-Party members, consulted him on their work. He also participated in some Party group meetings related to his work and read relevant Party documents. He had power and authority in his work and had abused his power to suppress watermelon prices too low, causing dissatisfaction among farmers. However, he said that he "had the position but no authority, could only play the role of a microphone," was "a deaf man's ear," and a "second landlord." He slandered, "The current personnel system is the Communist Party's personnel system, not the People's Republic of China's personnel system." He said, "Party member cadres have smooth sailing and a bright future; non-Party cadres are promoted like 'Guan Yu passing five passes.'" "The Party has more suspicion than trust in non-Party people." He said, "Democratic parties are 'living on with illnesses,' and I am 'carrying a burden through life.'" He even viciously used the accusations of the patriotic poet Qu Yuan, who lived more than two thousand years ago, against the fatuous and fatuous monarch of the time, to attack the Communist Party, which represents the interests of the people today, saying that today "the bell of the ancient musical scale is destroyed and discarded, while the earthenware pot makes a booming sound, slanderers are in high positions, and virtuous men are nameless." He claimed to be the "bell of the ancient musical scale" and a "virtuous man." He also wrote some poems lamenting the new society: "I regret that I was born too early, and I have suffered injuries that make me imperfect; it is difficult to buy public opinion by cleansing my heart and body, and I have lived a life of indifference in the forest and fields." "Human feelings are cold and difficult to approach, and I bow my head and sigh in secret grief."
    After the symposium of non-Party figures, he became even more elated, reciting his "anti-Party" masterpiece at the meeting to others, slandering those who spoke fairly at the meeting as "singing praises" and "flattering the leaders without mentioning shortcomings." Only he had put forward sharp criticisms. When he saw the People's Daily editorial "Why is this?", he said to others with great displeasure: "I am not satisfied with this editorial, I want to write to them to question them, will they allow people to speak? This is blocking people's right to speak, and the Party's rectification campaign is fake."
    After Miao Chunsen's anti-Party face was exposed, the people of Baotou are continuing to fight him.
                                                                                                (Liu Heng)

    黑心“贤士”—苗春森
    包头市商业局副局长、市人民代表大会代表、市政协委员苗春森的反党面目，已经被揭穿了。
    苗春森是地主家庭出身，解放前是个反动军官。解放后，人民宽恕了他，给了他相当高的职位，可是他一意与人民为敌。1950年，人民政府剿灭土匪时，他把一枝手枪私自出卖，结果到了土匪手里。人民政府明令禁烟禁毒，他却把私藏烟土出卖。“三反”“五反”以前，他利用他当工商局副局长的职权，和不法私商干非法勾当，并从中受贿。他常常站在资本家的立场来处理私营企业的劳资纠纷。长期以来，以写诗作为消遣。并说：“我们现在不如过去，将来不如现在，一天不如一天的活着。”
    和所有右派分子一样，当全国右派分子向党猖狂进攻的时候，他也突然“活跃”起来。认为这是“建国以来第一次思想大解放”。他说储安平“党天下”说法是“一鸣惊人，打中要害”，说葛佩琦要杀共产党人是“好样的”，“敢说话”。他还到各科室征求对党的不满意见，说：“我们民主人士，说了话起作用，有什么意见我给你们反映”。以后，他在市委召开的非党人士座谈会上和其他会上，打着“赤诚相见”的幌子，引经据典，借古喻今，对党大肆攻击。他说：“由各单位到中央，都放一个看门的。真是‘普天之下，莫非王土’。”他诬蔑党是个宗派集团，党组织是“权门”。说什么“一朝天子一朝臣”，“朝里有人好作官”。还说：“宗派主义严重的就是党性强”。“在宗派主义的压制下，是糖衣炮弹好接受，忠言逆耳不受听。”“在宗派主义压制下，形成党员亲而狎，群众敬而疏。亲则言无不尽，疏则情不上通。非党人士好坏只凭党员一报，报红则红，报白则白。甚至个别品质恶劣者竟以缺德手段出卖同志为自己进宠的资本，而领导上难免偏听偏信。”
    苗春森在商业局分管物价、财会、基建、业务等四个重要科，局内科长、科员，不论党员、非党员都向他请示工作。他还参加过一些与其工作有关的党组会，看过有关的党的文件。他在工作中有职有权，而且曾经滥用职权，把西瓜价格压得过低，引起农民不满。可是他却说他“有职无权，只能起个麦克风的作用”，是“聋子的耳朵”，“二房东”。他诬蔑“现在的人事制度是共产党的人事制度，不是中华人民共和国的人事制度”。说“党员干部是一帆风顺，鹏程万里；非党干部被提拔就像‘关云长过五关’。”“党对非党人士是怀疑有余，信任不足。”说“民主党派是‘带病延年’，我是‘背着包袱过春秋’”。他甚至恶毒地把两千多年以前爱国诗人屈原对当时昏庸无道的国君的控诉，用来攻击当今代表人民利益的共产党，说什么如今是“黄钟毁弃，瓦釜雷鸣，谗人高张，贤士无名。”他自命是“黄钟”、“贤士”。他还作些控诉新社会的诗：“恨我生问世过早，遭创伤已非完人；涤心身难买众意，怡林田淡泊了生。”“人情冷酷难接近，俯首慨叹暗伤心。”
    党外人士座谈会后，他更得意忘形，向人朗诵他在会上的“反党”杰作，诽谤在会上说公道话的“歌功颂德”，“不谈缺点，献媚领导”。唯有他提出了尖锐的批评。当他看见人民日报“这是为什么？”的社论后，极不高兴地对人说：“我不满意这篇社论，我要给他们写信质问，让不让人说话？这是堵塞人们的发言权，党的整风是虚假的。”
    苗春森的反党面目被揭发后，包头人们还在继续跟他斗争。
