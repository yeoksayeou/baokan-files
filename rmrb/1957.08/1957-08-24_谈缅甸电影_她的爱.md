　　Talking About the Burmese Film "Her Love"
　　Zheng Zhenduo
    It is necessary to promote mutual understanding and closer contact between the Chinese and Burmese people through cultural and artistic exchanges, thereby enhancing their friendship and solidarity. Since the people of China and Burma gained independence and liberation, the obstacles imposed by imperialists to hinder friendly exchanges between the two nations have been removed. We have experienced frequent exchanges in culture, art, economy, religion, and more, especially in culture and art. Performances of songs, dances, dramas, and films are particularly effective in deeply touching the hearts and stirring the brotherly feelings of the Chinese and Burmese people.
    Chinese cultural and artistic groups have visited Burma several times, and Burmese cultural and artistic groups have also come to China on several occasions. Each exchange of cultural and artistic delegations has deepened mutual understanding and friendship between our two peoples, playing a positive role in maintaining peace in Asia and the world.
    Currently, China is holding Asian Film Week, which is one of the endeavors to promote mutual understanding, friendship, and solidarity among the people of Asian countries. The outstanding Burmese film "Her Love" is one of the participating films. Burma's film industry is highly developed, meeting domestic needs and enjoying a broad demand among the people of Southeast Asia. China has previously screened Burmese films, but not on the scale of the current publicity and screenings. I believe that after a large number of Chinese viewers watch the Burmese film "Her Love," they will gain a better understanding of the lives of the Burmese people and will certainly appreciate the achievements of Burmese film art.
    "Her Love" uses the love of Burmese youth as its theme, exposing social injustice and deception. The female lead, Mai Ding, sings indignantly:
    Inside the tall buildings, it feels like New Year's every day, New Year's every day!
    Fine wine and delicacies, silk and satin,
    They never run out of things to eat and wear!
    Rich children, wealthy merchants,
    Don't know the plight of the poor.
    The poor people,
    Live in dilapidated thatched houses,
    Living with cattle and horses, bitten by mosquitoes and flies,
    What they eat is even worse.
    A dish of salted fish, half a bowl of spicy soup,
    Half of the rice is bran.
    The suffering of the poor is endless.
    Heavens, why do you treat people so unfairly?
    Why is the disparity between rich and poor so great?
    Why is the disparity between rich and poor so great? Doesn't this have the same indignant sentiment as the song "Scorching Sun Burns Like Fire" from "Water Margin"? Mai Ding and the male lead, Chen Miya, are classmates from elementary school. She falls in love with him, but he falls in love with another woman, Dan Dan. Dan Dan's father, Wu Bo Sang, is a wealthy man. Chen Miya drops out of school due to poverty and works as a farmhand for Wu Bo Sang. Dan Dan goes to Yangon to attend university. Despite the disparity in wealth and status, the feelings from their childhood are still preserved. Chen Miya works hard, using every method to accumulate money and lend it out at high interest. He embarks on the path of the exploiting class. He thinks that if he becomes rich, he can marry Dan Dan. Dan Dan also often sends him gifts from afar, further increasing his fantasies and hopes. Unfortunately, Chen Miya's pipe dream of getting rich is awakened by a major flood, and he remains penniless. He begins to understand his mistakes. At the same time, Dan Dan also drops out of school and returns home. With her father's insistence, she marries a con man. Soon, that con man swindles a large sum of cash from Wu Bo Sang and escapes with his mistress. Chen Miya, his beautiful dream shattered, has gone to the mountains to work. One day, Dan Dan invites Mai Ding to go to the mountains for a walk. A herd of startled cattle chases her into a thatched hut. Lying sick in this thatched hut is Chen Miya, but their feelings are like ashes and cannot be rekindled. He knows who he needs. The next day, Chen Miya's malaria flares up again. Mai Ding rushes to his side. Chen Miya collapses into Mai Ding's arms; she is the one he needs. Dan Dan slowly stands up, sadly and blankly leaving them.
    Such a story is very touching, the plot is winding, and the background is beautiful. The life of the farmers is depicted as both hard and joyful. The endless rice paddies, the lush green, sword-like rice leaves, the clear, rippling water surface, the distant mountains, the white clouds in the sky, and the farmers working hard in the fields, hoping to realize their dreams, together form a unique ensemble of Burma, that rich, golden nation. Anyone who has been to Burma will immediately recognize that this is Burma, this is the idyllic homeland that one longs for. But in this paradise, the poor farmers, even though they work hard, from diligently transplanting rice seedlings in the paddies all the way to harvesting, are still poorly clothed and fed. They are cruelly exploited by the rich. They imagine a better, prosperous future, just like Chen Miya imagines, but how can it be realized? Here, the writers and directors of "Her Love" depict the contrast between rich and poor very realistically and touchingly. This is a love story of young men and women, but it is permeated with social injustice and deception. It is a good film, worthy of recommendation to Chinese audiences.
      The screenwriter of "Her Love" is Wu Yang Nana, and the director is Wu Qian Tun. They are both experienced and good writers and directors.
    After watching "Her Love," we will have a greater understanding of the lives of the Burmese people, the daily lives of the vast majority of the Burmese people. The vast majority of the Burmese people are so hardworking and brave, so loyal and sincere. Their suffering will win us many tears; their joy will also make us happy and cheerful!
    Through the widespread screening of "Her Love" in China, as well as other cultural and artistic exchange activities, we believe that the people of China and Burma will, on the basis of traditional friendship, further enhance and consolidate mutual understanding, friendship, and solidarity between our two peoples, and will contribute greatly to maintaining peace in Asia and the world.

　　谈缅甸电影“她的爱”
　　郑振铎
    通过文化、艺术的交流，使中、缅两国人民彼此更加了解，彼此有更亲切的接触，从而增进了中、缅两国人民的相互友好与团结，乃是必要的事业。自从中、缅两国人民各自获得独立和解放以来，帝国主义者阻挠中、缅两国人民之间的友好往来的障碍物除去了，我们两国之间，便有了频繁的文化、艺术、经济、宗教等等方面的交流，特别是文化、艺术的交流。通过形象歌舞、戏剧和电影等等的演出，尤能深入人心，打动中、缅两国人民的兄弟般的感情。
    中国的文化、艺术团体曾经到过缅甸几次，缅甸的文化、艺术团体也来到中国几次。每一次的文化、艺术团体的往来，都更加深了我们两国人民之间的相互了解和友好；对于维护亚洲和世界的和平，起了良好的作用。
    现在，中国举行着亚洲电影周。这乃是亚洲各国人民相互了解、友好和团结的事业之一。缅甸的优秀的电影“她的爱”，是参加的影片之一。缅甸的电影事业是很发达的，不仅供应了缅甸国内的需要，在东南亚的人民里，也有广大的需要。中国过去曾经演出缅甸的电影，但没有像现在这样大规模地宣传着演出的。我想，中国的大量观众看了这部缅甸电影“她的爱”之后，对于缅甸人民的生活一定会有更好的了解，对于缅甸的电影艺术的成就，也一定会很赞赏的。
    “她的爱”是以缅甸的青年恋爱为题材，而揭发着社会上的不平与欺诈的。女主角迈丁不平地唱道：
    高楼里边，好像是天天过年，天天过年！
    美酒和佳肴，绫罗和绸缎，
    吃穿没个完！
    富家子弟，豪绅大贾，
    哪晓得穷人难。
    贫穷的人，
    住的是一间破烂不堪的草房，
    和牛马同居，被蚊蝇叮咬，
    他们吃的，更不像样。
    一碟腌咸鱼，半碗辣酱汤，
    米里一半糠。
    穷人的苦处说也说不完。
    老天哪，您待人为何这样偏？
    为什么贫富悬殊不一般？
    为什么，贫富悬殊不一般？这不和“水浒传”的“赤日炎炎似火烧”的歌有相同的愤慨的情绪么？迈丁和男主角陈米亚是小学里的同学。她爱上了他，可是他却爱上了另一位女子丹丹。丹丹的父亲吴波桑是一个大财主。陈米亚因贫失学，就在吴波桑那里做长工。丹丹到了仰光，上大学。虽然贫富悬殊，身分不同，但童年时代的感情还保存着。陈米亚拼命地干活，用尽方法，积累金钱，来放高利贷。他走上了剥削阶级的道路。他想发了财，就可以和丹丹结婚了。丹丹也常常远道寄赠些礼物给他，更增加了他的幻想和希望。不幸，陈米亚的发财的痴梦被一场大水灾惊醒了，他依然一贫如洗。他开始明白了自己的错误。同时，丹丹也退学回家。由于她父亲的主持，她和一位骗子结婚了。不久，那个骗子却骗了吴波桑的一大笔现款，偕同情妇逃走了。陈米亚这时因为美梦的破灭已跑到山里去做活。一天，丹丹约了迈丁，同到山上去散心。一群惊牛把她追赶到一座草屋里去。在这草屋里生病躺着的正是陈米亚，但他们的感情已如死灰似的不能复燃了。他知道他所需要的是谁。第二天，陈米亚的疟疾又发作了。迈丁赶了来。陈米亚倒向在迈丁的怀里，她正是他所需要的。丹丹慢慢地站起来，悲伤地茫茫地离开了他们。
    这样的故事很动人，情节很曲折，背景很美丽。农民的生活被描绘得辛苦而愉快。那一望无际的稻田，那碧油油的剑锋似的禾叶，那清澈见底的涟涟的水面，那远山，那天上的白云，那拼命在田里干活，希望实现美梦的农民们，组成了一首缅甸那富饶的黄金色的国家所特有的合奏曲。到过缅甸的人，一看就会知道，那就是缅甸，那就是令人留恋的乐园之乡的缅甸。但在这个乐园里，贫穷的农民们虽然拼命地干活，从辛勤地在水田里插秧，一直忙到收割，而他们仍然是衣不暖、食不饱。他们是残苦地被富人们剥削着。他们想像着将来的美好的富裕的日子，正像陈米亚所想像的一般，但怎么有可能实现呢？在这里，“她的爱”的编导者们把贫富的对比，描写得十分真切而动人。这是一篇青年男女的恋爱的故事，但渗透着的却是社会的不平与欺诈。它是一部好的电影，值得向中国观众推荐的。
      “她的爱”的编剧者是吴仰那纳，导演是吴千吞，他们都是有经验的好的编导。
    看了“她的爱”之后，对于缅甸人民的生活，缅甸最大多数的人民的日常生活的面目，我们便会了解得多了。最大多数的缅甸人民是那么勤劳勇敢，是那么忠贞真诚。他们的苦难会赢得我们许多的眼泪；他们的欢乐，也便会使我们高兴，快活！
    通过了“她的爱”在中国的普遍放映，还有其他的文化、艺术的交流活动，我们相信，中、缅两国人民是会在传统的友谊的基础之上，更加增进并巩固我们两国人民之间的相互了解、友好与团结的，也便是，会对于维护亚洲和世界和平贡献出很大的力量与作用的。
