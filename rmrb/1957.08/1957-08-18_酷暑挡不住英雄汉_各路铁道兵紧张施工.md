Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch: The People's Liberation Army Railway Corps are currently intensifying construction on several lines.

	On the construction site of the Bi(sezhai) to He(kou) Railway in Yunnan, the rails have been laid to Majie, only twenty-eight kilometers away from Hekou. The weather here is extremely hot, and transportation is inconvenient. When the project first started, the officers and soldiers were once unable to get vegetables, and sometimes even grain supplies were insufficient. Therefore, the soldiers went to the mountains to collect wild vegetables and cook thin porridge to drink, persevering in construction under the blazing summer sun, ensuring the completion of the track-laying task.

	The pilot tunnel of the longest, more than 300-meter-long, Wankou Tunnel on the Nan(ping) to Fu(zhou) line in Fujian has been opened. The construction units, paying attention to improving operating methods and extensively carrying out the advanced producer movement, the Lin Jiashan group and the Li Yuankun group have recently created records of 33.7 meters and 34.2 meters of advance per day, respectively, reaching 278% of the national unified quota.

	The station building construction project of the Bao(tou) to Yin(chuan) section of the Baolan Railway is being accelerated with material preparation and construction. From Gongmiaozi to Sanshenggong, it has been determined to build seven larger stations and nineteen intermediate stations, with a total construction area of more than 25,000 square meters. In order to strive for completion on time, the Fourth Engineering Team of the Railway Corps Construction Department has fully launched material preparation and construction along the line. Construction of the Xishan Zui station began in late May, and construction of the Sanshenggong station also began half a month ahead of schedule in mid-July. Bricklaying is already underway at several construction sites in Linhe and Xixiaozhao stations. At present, all construction personnel are actively responding to the call of the engineering team, earnestly striving for good quality, speed, economy, and safety in construction, and striving to complete the station construction task ahead of schedule.

	On the construction site of the special railway line for the Xin'anjiang Hydropower Station in Zhejiang, a certain unit of the Railway Corps, in order to strive for the early opening of the special line and support the construction of the Xin'anjiang Hydropower Station, has completed the magnificent Lanjiang Railway Bridge four and a half days ahead of schedule.

    酷暑挡不住英雄汉
    各路铁道兵紧张施工
    新华社17日讯  中国人民解放军铁道兵各部队目前正在好几条线路上加紧施工。
    在云南碧（色寨）河（口）铁路工地上，铁轨已铺到离河口只有二十八公里的马街。这里天气酷热，交通不便。工程刚开始的时候，官兵们曾经一度吃不到蔬菜，有时粮食也供应不上。于是，战士们就到山上采集野菜，煮点稀粥喝，在夏日炎炎下坚持施工，保证了铺轨任务的完成。
    福建南（平）福（州）线最长的三百多公尺弯口隧道导坑已经打通了。施工部队由于注意改善作业方法，广泛地开展先进生产者运动，林家善小组和李元坤小组最近又先后创造了日进三十三点七公尺和三十四点二公尺的成绩，达到国家统一定额的278％。
    包兰线包（头）银（川）段的车站站房建筑工程正在加紧备料施工。从公庙子到三盛公，确定修建七个较大的车站和十九个区间站，建筑面积共两万五千多平方公尺。为争取按时完工，铁道兵建筑处第四工程队已在沿线全面展开备料施工。西山咀车站早在5月下旬就开始施工了，三盛公车站也提前半个月在7月中旬开始施工，临河、西小赵车站几个施工点，已在进行砌砖工程。目前，全体施工人员积极响应工程队的号召，在施工中认真做到好、快、省、安全，争取提前完成建站任务。
    在浙江新安江水电站专用线工地上，铁道兵某部为争取专用线早日通车，支援新安江水电站的建设，已经提前四天半把宏伟的兰江大铁桥修好了。（附图片）
