　　A Trip to the Flood Area
　　By Our Correspondent Zhan Chao

　　Tense Battle
　　These days, the Vietnamese people have all been watching the rush-repair project at the breach of the "Mei Lin Sluice" more than ten kilometers northwest of Hanoi.
　　Undertaking this combat mission are soldiers of the Vietnamese People's Army, civilian workers, government cadres, and young students. People are working day and night.
　　On the night of July 30, the Mei Lin construction site was brilliantly lit. Counting back, this was already the twentieth night of fighting the flood. The breach was still nine meters wide, but the Dun River was continuing to rise. This was a decisive moment. The shock troops of the Southern and Northern units, who were respectively undertaking the direct rush-repair tasks on the east and west sides of the breach, decided to cut off the flood and block the breach before dawn. Thus, the most intense battle began. The soldiers rolled iron wire cages, each filled with four to five tons of stones, down from both sides of the breach. The floodwaters were squeezed through the increasingly narrow breach, charging across like a wounded beast. But the heroic Vietnamese People's Army finally defeated this most vicious enemy, rolling down the last iron wire cage at 5:35 a.m. Two gold-starred red flags were crossed and planted at the newly blocked breach, and a chorus of cheers and the song "Unity is Strength" rang out at the construction site.
　　We were deeply moved by this scene and stayed on the embankment for a long time. Afterwards, we walked towards a row of tents set up on the side of the embankment, where we met Lieutenant General Huang Van Thai, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Vietnamese People's Army, who was the commander-in-chief of this breach-blocking project. This general, who was one of the organizers of the Dien Bien Phu victory, said meaningfully: "Blocking the breach is a major victory, but the battle is not over. We must be vigilant and never withdraw our troops until we have achieved a complete victory."
　　At this time, the sun was shining brightly, and looking out from the tent, the construction site was filled with a busy scene. In order to protect the lives and property of the people, the soldiers and civilian workers, regardless of their fatigue, were carrying out the "closing" and restoration of the dike, according to the new orders of the headquarters, in order to meet the flood peak that might arrive soon.

　　Fortresses on "Islands"
　　Standing on the high ground of the Mei Lin construction site and looking out, to the south is the rolling water of the man-made canal connecting the Red River and the Thai Binh River—the Dun River, and to the north is the vast flood area submerged by the flood.
　　That was what happened at 4:00 a.m. on July 11. A sluice gate located on the Dun River embankment in the Mei Lin Commune was washed away, and the surging floodwaters flowed continuously from the more than eighty-meter breach, quickly engulfing the low-lying villages, roads, and fields on the north bank of the river. At the same time, it filled a canal called "Five County Creek," destroying its embankments, and then the muddy floodwaters overflowed in all directions, submerging eighty-eight communes in three counties of Bac Ninh Province and Vinh Phuc Province, west of the Hanoi-Muc Nam Quan Railway, within a few days, covering an area of about three hundred square kilometers.
　　As soon as the disaster occurred, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam took emergency measures and resolutely carried out the rush-repair project during the flood season of the Dun River. During those emergency days, Premier Pham Van Dong of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam went to the construction site almost every day to personally understand and grasp the situation, and to make decisions on key issues. Other leaders of the Party and the government also frequently inspected the embankment. Chinese water conservancy experts, who were invited to help with the rush-repair project, were also working day and night. Through the efforts of all parties, the breach of the Mei Lin Sluice was finally blocked at 5:35 a.m. on July 31.
　　Now, more than 100 million cubic meters of floodwater in the flood area is slowly being discharged into the Cau River in the north, and the water level is gradually decreasing. Looking from the edge of the flood area, it is still a vast lake, and villages, like countless large and small islands, are scattered in the turbulent lake.
　　When people heard that hundreds of thousands of people lived inside, they couldn't help but express their infinite concern for their fate.
　　We got the answer from the Tu Son County Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party: the people in the flood area did not suffer much loss.
　　Tu Son County is one of the three counties hit by the flood, and it is also located at the head of the water. Out of the county's total of twenty-one communes, eighteen were flooded. We arrived there the day after the breach was blocked, but we still had to wade through a long stretch of water that was knee-deep.
　　Coincidentally, when we arrived, the county committee and the county government had just finished compiling the figures for the losses in the flood area, and they told us: under the serious water disaster, only six people died out of the 71,394 people in the eighteen communes, and the remaining losses were seven cattle, nineteen pigs, 630 kilograms of rice, and 698 houses (mud houses, which can be repaired with mud). Many rural Party branches took the initiative to take care of the masses in the days of crisis, playing the role of combat fortresses, and minimizing the losses.

　　Life in the Water Village
　　We came out of the Tu Son County Committee and hired a small boat on the west side of the railway subgrade to go to the flood area.
　　After more than an hour, we arrived in front of Shouxi Village in Dongshou Commune. The water in the village had not completely receded, so we had to walk in barefoot. At this time, many people who had been evacuated were returning home by boat one after another, and some who lived nearby even brought back their babbling children. The young and middle-aged people who had defended their homes on the buildings of the former landlord Du Wen Dui or other high places had already come down, and some were taking turns getting haircuts, a dozen or so water buffalo were lying nearby resting, and not far away there were sounds of chickens and dogs scurrying around. All of this foreshadowed that life would soon return to normal.
　　The small boat carried us southwest again and landed in Dongbi Village, another village in Dongshou Commune. This is a small village with more than 60 households and more than 270 people, and now it is slowly becoming active again. Just like in Shouxi Village, the secretary of the commune branch had recently taken someone else's boat to Shouxi Village, where he would spend the night arranging work.
　　An old man invited us to sit in his thatched cottage, half of whose walls had been washed away by the flood. His name is Nguyen Van To, he is fifty-two years old this year, and he is the father of the branch secretary, but they have been living separately for a long time. Now, with the old man are his wife, second son, daughter-in-law, and a young grandson. During the flood, he let them move to his relatives' home in Bac Giang Province to stay, and he stayed alone to look after the house. Everyone responded to the call of the branch and the government and put the rice that could not be moved under the roof beam, which was higher than the great flood of 1945. He did the same, and as a result, he did not lose a single grain of rice. As soon as the water receded, he responded to the call and sowed seedlings in the yard, which was covered with a thick layer of alluvial soil. Today, his wife and second son made a special trip back to see him, and the three of them worked together to tidy up the house: the second son tidied up the cattle pen, the old woman peeled taro to prepare for cooking, and the old man was working to mix mud to repair the half of the wall. Seeing us coming, like other families in the water village, they were all very happy and insisted on letting us sit on the only bamboo couch in the house, offering us tea cup after cup, and the conversation began. The old woman and the second son said that they did not feel any inconvenience outside. The government and the local people did everything possible to arrange accommodation, giving up small plots of farmland to sow seedlings. The state-owned trading company also issued rice to grind into rice, and for every fifty kilograms of rice, they got two kilograms of rice, a large pile of rice bran, and 1,900 yuan in wages, which was not only enough to eat but also had a surplus.

　　Eighty-Year-Old Man Talks About the Past and Present
　　Later, we took a boat to Xieping Village in Yunhe Commune, where we met an 83-year-old man named Nguyen Van Ren. As soon as he met us, he said that he had experienced four major floods in his life, and the disaster in 1945 was the most serious, and this time the rescue was the fastest. Once the water recedes, alluvial soil will be left behind, and a good autumn rice harvest is expected.
　　In Zhongban Village, there is an 84-year-old man named Nguyen Van Feng, who said that his life is a vivid contrast between the old and new societies. In the past three floods, his family was mostly scattered, and sometimes they even had to beg for a living, but what about now? He was allocated five acres and three points of land and a water buffalo in rent reduction and land reform. In this flood, not only was he not short of food, but he also had a surplus of 2,600 kilograms of rice.
　　In Dongbi Village, there is an old man named Nguyen Van Sui. In 1945, his family alone died seven people. Now, not only has none of the thirteen people in the family starved to death, but they are also well-fed and well-clothed during the flood.
　　The sun was setting, and we said goodbye to those experienced 70- and 80-year-old men and left the flood area by boat. (Attached photo)

　　泛区纪行
　　本报记者　展潮
    紧张的战斗
    这些天来，越南人民全都注视着河内西北十多公里的“梅林水闸”决口的抢堵工程。
    担任这个战斗任务的是越南人民军战士、民工、机关干部和青年学生们。人们昼夜不停地工作着。
    7月30日夜，梅林工地上灯火辉煌。屈指计算，这已经是和洪水搏斗的第二十个夜晚了。决口还有九公尺宽，敦河水却在继续上涨。这是个决定性的时刻。分别在决口东、西两边担任直接抢堵任务的南方部队和北方部队的突击手们，决定要在天亮之前切断洪水、堵住决口。于是，一场最激烈的战斗开始了。战士们把一个个装满四、五吨重石块的铁丝笼从决口两边滚下去，洪水被挤在愈来愈紧的决口处通过，仿佛是一头负伤的猛兽似的横冲直闯。但是，英雄的越南人民军终于战胜了这股最凶恶的敌人，在清晨五点三十五分滚下最后一个铁丝笼。两面金星红旗交叉着插在刚被堵住的决口处，工地上响起了一片欢呼声和“团结就是力量”的歌声。
    我们被这种情景深深地感染着，在坝头上停留了好久好久。随后，向着搭在堤埂边上的一列帐篷走去，在那里遇见了越南人民军副总参谋长黄文泰少将，他是这次堵口工程的总指挥。这位曾经是奠边府战役胜利的组织者之一的将军，意味深长地说：“堵住决口是一次重大的胜利，但是战斗并没有结束。我们要提高警惕，不取得彻底胜利决不收兵。”
    这时候阳光灿烂，从帐篷里看出去，工地上充满着一片忙碌的景象。为了保卫人民的生命、财产，战士们和民工们不顾一切疲劳，正按照着总指挥部新的号令，紧张地进行“闭气”和复堤工程，以迎击不久可能到来的洪峰。
          “岛屿”上的堡垒
    站在梅林工地高处眺望，南边是连接红河和太平江的人造运河——敦河的滚滚流水，北边是被洪水漫没的茫茫的一片泛区。
    那是7月11日清晨四点钟发生的事。座落在梅林社地界敦河堤上的一座水闸被冲垮了，汹涌的洪水从八十多公尺的决口源源地流进，很快就把河堤北岸低洼的村舍、道路和田野吞没了，同时又把一条叫做“五县溪”的干渠灌满了，冲毁了它的堤坝，于是混浊的洪水便向着四面八方流溢，在短短的几天里漫没了河内一睦南关铁路西侧北宁省和永福省三个县八十八个社，方圆约有三百多公里宽。
    灾情一发生，越南民主共和国政府就采取了紧急措施，坚决在敦河汛期里进行抢堵工程。在那紧急的日子里，越南民主共和国政府总理范文同几乎每天都到工地上，亲自了解和掌握情况，并对关键性的问题作出决定。党和政府其他的领导人也经常到堤坝上视察。应邀前来帮助抢堵工程的中国水利专家们，也昼夜不停地在进行工作。经过各方面的努力，梅林水闸决口终于在7月31日清晨五点三十五分堵住了。
    现在，泛区里一亿多立方公尺的洪水正慢慢地向北面的球江里排泄，水位在逐渐地下降着。从泛区的边沿看过去，那里面依然是一个宽阔无比的湖泊，一座座仿佛是无数大小岛屿似的村庄，就星罗棋布地散处在那浊浪翻滚的大湖里。
    当人们听说里面住着十几、二十万人民的时候，都不禁要为他们的遭遇表示无限的关怀。
    我们在越南劳动党慈山县委会那里得到了答案：泛区里人民损失不大。
    慈山县是遭受洪水侵袭的三个县里的一个，并且还处在水头上，全县总共二十一社，就有十八个社被淹。我们是在堵住决口后第二天才到那里去的，但是还得跋涉膝盖那么深的长长的一段水路。
    很凑巧，当我们到达的时候，县委会和县政府刚把泛区损失的数目字归齐，就告诉了我们：在严重的水灾袭击下，十八个社七万一千三百九十四人中只牺牲了六个人，其余损失了七头牛、十九口猪、六百三十公斤稻子和六百九十八间房（土房，用泥浆修补即可）。许多农村党的支部在危难的日子里主动照顾群众，起到了战斗堡垒的作用，使损失减少到最低限度。
              水乡生涯
    我们从慈山县委会出来，在铁路路基西侧雇了只小船，到泛区里去。
    经过了一个多钟头，我们到了东寿社的寿溪村跟前。村子里水还没有退尽，得光着脚板走进去。这时，许多转移出去的人都陆续坐船回来探家，有的住在靠近的甚至还把咿啊学话的小孩也带回来了。在过去地主杜文兑的楼房上或其他高处坚守家乡的青壮年人早早就下来了，有的正在互相替换着理发，十来头水牛正躺在附近休息，不远处有鸡、狗飞窜的声音，这一切都预示着生活很快就要恢复常轨了。
    小船又把我们载向西南，在东寿社另一个村庄——东壁村上岸。这是个有六十多户、二百七十多口人的小村庄，现在也慢慢地活跃起来了。正像在寿溪村似的，社支部书记不久前乘着别人的船到寿溪村去了，他要在那边过夜布置工作。
    一位老人请我们到他的被洪水浸垮了半幅墙壁的茅屋去坐。他的名字叫阮文讨，今年五十二岁，是支部书记的父亲，但是他们早就分居了，现在和老人在一起的有他的老婆、二儿、儿媳和一个小孙子。水灾期间，他让他们转移到北江省的亲戚家里去寄住，自己一个人留下看家，所有的人都响应支部和政府的号召，把搬不走的稻子搁在比1945年大水灾时还要高的屋梁下面，他也按照这样办了，结果半粒稻子也没有丢掉。水刚一退，他又响应号召，在积着厚厚一层冲积土的院子里撒种秧苗。今天，他老婆和二儿特别赶回来看他，三个人一起动手整理家务：二儿收拾牛圈，老太婆削芋头准备烧饭，老头子正在动手和泥要把那半幅墙补起来。见到我们来了，和水乡里其他人家一样，他们一家子都很高兴，硬让我们在屋子里唯一的一张竹榻上坐下来，一杯杯地让着茶水，话匣子也就打开了。老太婆和二儿说，他们在外并不感到有什么不便，政府和当地群众尽一切可能给安排住处，让出小块耕地撒种秧苗，国营贸易公司还发给稻子磨米，每五十公斤得二公斤米、一大堆谷糠和一千九百元工钱，不仅够吃而且还有节余。
            八十老人话今昔
    我们后来又坐船到了云河社的设评村，在这里遇见了一位八十三岁高龄的名叫阮文任的老人，他一见面就说自己一生曾经经过四次大水灾，以1945年灾情最厉害，以这次抢救得最快。水一退，冲积土留下来，秋稻丰收有望。
    在中版村，有一位今年八十四岁的老人，名叫阮文峰，他说他的一生是一幅新旧社会的鲜明对照的图画。过去三次水灾，他的家人多是流散四方，有时甚至还要乞讨度日，可是现在呢？他在减租、土改中分得了五亩三分田、一头水牛，这次水灾他不仅不缺粮，而且还有积余稻子二千六百公斤。
    东壁村有一位名叫阮文随的老人，1945年光他家就死了七口人，现在全家十三口人不仅没有一个饿死的，而且在水灾期间还是丰衣足食。
    太阳快要西沉了，我们告别了那些阅历丰富的七、八十岁的老年人，乘船离开泛区。（附图片）
