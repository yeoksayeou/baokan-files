George's Troubles
　　Feng Zhidan

    George, a middle school student in Minneapolis, USA, although only fifteen or sixteen years old, has become a small stamp collector due to the influence of his grandfather, old George, who loved stamp collecting.

    Old George passed away in 1949. Therefore, collecting new stamps after 1949 has become young George's sacred duty.

    In recent years, young George's achievements can be said to be very commendable. He has collected almost all the stamps in the world, but, unfortunately, there are no stamps from New China in his stamp album.

    Young George did not realize that this biggest flaw existed in his work. To be honest, he didn't even know that there was a People's Republic of China in the world. Young George's ignorance is not at all surprising, because in the United States, there are a group of magicians like Secretary of State Dulles, who used sleight of hand to make millions of Americans unable to see the existence of the great People's Republic of China, even with their eyes open. However, young George lives in reality after all. He heard that in Whitting City in this state, there was a girl named Finlette Grossu who had written a letter to the mayor of Guangzhou in "mainland China" requesting a Chinese doll. And in 1957, she indeed received this precious New Year's gift from the mayor of Guangzhou. At the same time, in the European stamp catalogs he received, he saw stamps from "Communist China," but in the American stamp catalogs, they were definitely not to be found. All of these formed an incomprehensible enigma in young George's mind.

    After this, young George was troubled by this question every day: Why couldn't he get a "Communist China" stamp? One day, he met stamp dealer Mr. Smith. Young George said to him:
      "I want to get a 'Communist China' stamp, sir. Can you buy one for me? Because my stamp album lacks a Chinese stamp, and you know, that's very unsightly!"

    "Ha, my young friend," Mr. Smith patted young George on the shoulder and said, "Chinese stamps? Yes, you're not the only one. I've had many stamp collecting enthusiasts ask me for Chinese stamps. But, young friend, I must advise you, don't make it known. You must wait for the opportunity. Perhaps one beautiful, clear morning, you will receive a letter from mainland China. As for buying Chinese stamps, that's dangerous."

    Young George opened his eyes wide, not understanding why buying a stamp would be "dangerous"?

    "We stamp trading people received a warning from Minskoff, the person in charge of the Foreign Assets Control Office in Washington, a few days ago," Mr. Smith shrugged his shoulders: "He warned that the U.S. government does not allow anyone to buy Chinese stamps. But everyone knows that Chinese stamps are bestsellers in Europe and around the world. Recently, the 'China Reconstructs' magazine published in Beijing is willing to provide us with a large number of Chinese stamps, but Minskoff's statement warned us not to subscribe to this magazine. He also stated that 'the U.S. government does not object to collecting stamps from Kuomintang China.'" "But, my God," Mr. Smith continued, "what 'Kuomintang China,' we are not interested in that at all. What everyone needs are the stamps issued by the real China with its 600 million people."

    "Then, why doesn't the government allow us stamp collectors to get Chinese stamps?" Young George asked naively.

      "Well, Minskoff said in his statement that it's 'because the U.S. government doesn't want dollars to flow to Communist countries,' which is completely misleading. The real reason is very simple, it's to prevent American citizens from even learning about the existence of China, this great country, from stamps. I've seen these stamps in Europe, with things like 'Five-Year Plan,' 'Chinese People's Liberation Army,' and plump ears of wheat printed on them... These may seem particularly dangerous to Mr. Dulles. But," Mr. Smith emphasized, "for stamp collectors, the only principle is that wherever there is a country on Earth, we must collect the stamps from there. But Mr. Dulles's principle is different from ours, so what can we do!"

    The American businessman became more and more excited as he talked, so much so that he completely didn't notice that his audience was a child who didn't understand politics at all. However, these words could not help but cause some fluctuations in young George's mind: What kind of country is China today? Of course, more importantly, how can he get Chinese stamps?

    Coincidentally, a few days later, young George saw a book review published in the June 8th issue of the American "Saturday Review" magazine. The book reviewer, David Karp, introduced a novel recently published in the United States by Burt Cole called "Subi: A Volcano," which described a "war" "with China as the imaginary enemy," and it was written about the situation in China. The author wrote that the Chinese were "driven by famine, disease, hatred, and nationalism" and that they fought using "human wave tactics." The author of this novel even collected the flood situation in China in the 1930s as material. The book review concluded sarcastically: "For those who want to use nuclear missiles against China" from a safe, harmless distance, "Cole's novel is worth reading."

    "Ah, China is such a country!" Young George couldn't help but shudder, "How terrible." But, what about the "Five-Year Plan" that Mr. Smith mentioned? He also thought that 1930 was clearly the era when his grandfather lived. At that time, old George was able to freely buy Chinese stamps; but now young George is not free. Why is that? What happened in China that the United States doesn't like?

    Young George still didn't get the stamps, but he couldn't help but become more and more interested in that new China.

    乔治的苦恼
    冯之丹
    美国明尼阿波利斯州的一个中学生乔治，虽然年纪只有十五六岁，但由于祖父老乔治爱好集邮的影响，他已经成为一个小集邮家了。
    老乔治在1949年去世。因此，收集1949年以后的新邮票，就成了小乔治的神圣的职责。
    这几年来小乔治的成绩可以说是非常值得夸耀的。他几乎把全世界的邮票都搜集齐全了，但是，很遗憾，在他的集邮册里没有新中国的邮票。
    小乔治并没有发现他的工作中竟然存在着这个最大的缺陷。说实在的，他一直不知道世界上已经有了一个中华人民共和国。小乔治的无知是丝毫也不足为奇的，因为在美国，有一批像国务卿杜勒斯这样的魔术师，他们施用了障眼法，使千百万的美国人长了眼睛却看不见伟大的中华人民共和国的存在。但是，小乔治毕竟生活在现实里。他听人说，在本州惠特京城有一个名叫芬勒特·格萝苏的女孩子，曾经写过一封信给“中国大陆”上的广州市长，要求得到一个中国的洋娃娃。而她在1957年果然从广州市长那里收到了这件珍贵的新年礼品。同时，小乔治在他收到的欧洲集邮目录里，看到了有“共产党中国”的邮票，但在美国的集邮目录里确确实实是找不到的。这些都在小乔治的脑海里形成了一个猜不透的哑谜。
    在这以后，小乔治天天都为这个问题而苦恼：为什么他竟得不到一张“共产党中国”的邮票？有一天，他遇见了邮票商史密斯先生。小乔治对他说：
      “我要得到一张‘共产党中国’的邮票，先生，你能不能替我买到呢？因为在我的集邮册里缺少一张中国的邮票，你知道，这是很不体面的！”
    “哈，我的小朋友，”史密斯先生拍了一下小乔治的肩膀说：“中国的邮票吗？是的，不只是你一个人，我曾经遇到许多集邮爱好者向我要中国的邮票。但是，小朋友，我得劝告你，不要声张，你必须等待时机，也许在一个美丽晴朗的早晨，你会收到中国大陆的信件。至于购买中国邮票，这是危险的。”
    小乔治睁大着眼睛，不懂得为什么购买一张邮票会是“危险的”？
    “我们邮票贸易界人士前些天从华盛顿外国资产管理处实施负责人明斯科夫那里得到了警告”，史密斯先生耸了一耸肩膀：“他警告说，美国政府不许可任何人购买中国的邮票。但是谁都知道，中国的邮票在欧洲和全世界都是畅销的。最近北京出版的‘中国建设’杂志愿意为我们提供大量中国的邮票，但是明斯科夫的声明里警告我们不要去订阅这个杂志。他还声明说：‘美国政府并不反对收集国民党中国的邮票’。”“可是，我的上帝，”史密斯先生继续说：“什么‘国民党中国’，我们丝毫也不感到兴趣。大家需要的是那个六亿人口的真正的中国所发行的邮票。”
    “那末，政府为什么不让我们集邮家得到中国的邮票呢？”小乔治天真地问道。
      “这个嘛，明斯科夫在声明中说是‘因为美国政府不愿意让美元流到共产党国家’去，这完全是骗人的。真正的原因很简单，就是不让美国公民甚至从邮票里了解到中国这个大国的存在。我在欧洲看到过这种邮票，上面印着‘五年计划’、‘中国人民解放军’、肥硕的麦穗……。这些也许在杜勒斯先生看来是特别危险的。但是，”史密斯先生加重了语气：“对集邮家来说，唯一的原则是，地球上那里有一个国家，我们就要收集那里的邮票。而杜勒斯先生的原则和我们的不同，这又有什么办法呢！”
    这位美国商人越谈越起劲，以致他完全没有注意到他的对象是一个根本不懂得政治的孩子。不过他的这些话不能不在小乔治的思想中引起了一些波动：今天的中国究竟是一个什么样的国家？当然更重要的还是怎样能得到中国的邮票。
    正巧，过了些日子，小乔治看到了6月8日的一期美国“星期六评论”杂志上刊载着一篇书评。那个名叫台维·卡柏的书评作者介绍说，最近美国出版的一本伯特·柯尔著的小说“苏比——一座火山”描述了“以中国为假想敌”的“战争”，而且写的是中国的情况。作者写道：中国人“受饥馑、疾病、仇恨和民族主义的驱使”，他们用“人海战术”进行战斗。这部小说的作者甚至把1930年时代的中国大水灾情况也收集进去作为素材。这篇书评最后以嘲讽的口气说：对于那些想在一个安全的、无害的距离以外“对中国使用核导弹的人说来，柯尔的这部小说是值得一读的”。
    “啊，中国原来是这样的一个国家！”小乔治不由得打了一个寒颤，“真可怕”。但是，史密斯先生说过的“五年计划”之类又是怎么回事呢？他又想到，1930年，这分明是老祖父生活着的年代。那时候，老乔治是能够自由地购买中国邮票的；而现在小乔治却不自由了。这是为什么呢？究竟在中国发生了什么美国不喜欢的事情呢？
    小乔治仍然没有得到邮票，可是他对于那个新的中国，却不由得越来越感到兴趣了。
