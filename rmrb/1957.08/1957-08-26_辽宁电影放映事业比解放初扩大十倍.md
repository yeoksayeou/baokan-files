　　Liaoning's Film Projection Industry
　　Has Expanded Tenfold Since the Early Days of Liberation
　　Liaoning Province now has more than 680 film projection units scattered throughout cities, enterprises, factories, mines, and the vast countryside, an increase of nearly eight times compared to the puppet Manchukuo period and more than ten times compared to the early days of liberation.
　　In the early days of liberation, Liaoning Province had only forty-nine dilapidated and poorly managed film projection units, mostly concentrated in the prosperous commercial districts of larger cities. Currently, there are more than 450 projection units in the cities, and more than 200 film projection teams in the countryside regularly tour more than 8,000 projection points. In 1950, the total number of viewers was only over 16.4 million, but in 1956, the total number of viewers reached over 100.04 million.

　  辽宁电影放映事业
    比解放初扩大十倍
    辽宁省已有遍布在城市、企业、厂矿和广大农村的六百八十多个电影放映单位，比伪满时期增长接近八倍，比解放初期增长十倍多。
    辽宁省解放初期，仅有四十九个设备破旧、经营落后的电影放映单位，而且大都集中在较大城市的繁荣商业区。目前城市已有的四百五十多个放映单位，农村也有二百多个电影队常年在八千多个放映点巡回放映。1950年观众总数只有一千六百四十多万人次，但1956年，观众总人次就达一亿零四万多。
