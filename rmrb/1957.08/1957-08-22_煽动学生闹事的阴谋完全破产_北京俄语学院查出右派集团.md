　　Plot to Incite Student Unrest Completely Bankrupt
　　Beijing Russian Language Institute Uncovers Rightist Clique
    (Our Newspaper News) Rightist elements at the Beijing Russian Language Institute have been successively exposed by teachers and students.

    Rightist elements Zhang Xishen and Huang Rubo were teaching assistants in the preparatory department for students studying in the Soviet Union at the Beijing Russian Language Institute. Under the guise of helping the Party with rectification, they carried out a series of conspiratorial activities centered around the "Spring Thunder" blackboard newspaper. Zhang Xishen, Huang Rubo, and others held secret meetings, attempting to stir up mass dissatisfaction, beat the Party Secretary Zhang Xichou and the Party Secretary of the Preparatory Department for Students Studying in the Soviet Union, Zhu Yunyi, and take students to the streets, inciting citizens to join them in action. However, this sinister conspiracy of the rightist elements was thwarted by the exposure of the masses.

    Zhang Xishen and Huang Rubo, on the one hand, slandered the Party committee for lacking confidence in leading the rectification campaign, and on the other hand, submitted a list of a so-called "rectification core group" that they had agreed upon to the Party branch of the teachers in the Preparatory Department for Students Studying in the Soviet Union, threatening the branch to consider "this list," attempting to use mass pressure to force the Party committee to give up its leadership.

    Zhang Xishen smeared the Party committee of the Beijing Russian Language Institute as a "filthy mess," saying, "Factionalism exists everywhere, Party members protect each other, big and small bureaucrats remain silent usually, but now they are taking revenge in the anti-rightist campaign." He also vilified China's socialist system and said that Hu Feng was not a counter-revolutionary. Zhang Xishen closely cooperated with Xie Lin, a rightist element within the Party in the institute, and frantically attacked the Party. He and Huang Rubo incited the work-study personnel and printing workers to "pour out their grievances," wrote big-character posters for them, distorting the workers' original intentions and exaggerating them.

    Xie Lin was the Party branch secretary of the 14th class of the teacher training course. During the rectification movement, he incited the masses to "pour out their grievances." Under his instigation, teachers and students in the training course formed a "small organization," determined the members of the "secretary-general" and "inspection group," and who would create big-character posters and who would contact the newspapers. Xie Lin and two others drafted and published a "declaration" attacking the Party committee, saying that "the Party committee is indifferent to the rectification and has abandoned leadership" and "leading cadres protect each other." Xie Lin incited the teachers of the training class to ignite trouble at the preparatory department for students studying in the Soviet Union three times. Xie Lin had read in advance Zhang Xishen's article published in Guangming Daily that slandered the Russian Language Institute and the Party committee, and he even signed the manuscript to prove that Zhang's article was factual.

    Xie Lin betrayed Party secrets and entered into an alliance with Zhang Xishen. When the Supervisory Committee spoke with him, he vilified it as a "joint trial," and afterwards told Zhang Xishen the contents of the conversation.

    Now, Xie Lin's anti-Party remarks have been severely refuted, and the few people who were temporarily confused have also awakened, made self-criticisms, and exposed his wrongdoings.

　　煽动学生闹事的阴谋完全破产
　　北京俄语学院查出右派集团
    本报讯　北京俄语学院的右派分子都被师生陆续揭发出来。
    右派分子张西神、黄如柏是北京俄语学院留苏预备部的助教。他们以“春雷”黑板报为中心，在帮助党整风的幌子下，进行了一系列的阴谋活动。张西神、黄如柏等曾秘密集会，企图挑起群众不满，殴打党委书记张锡俦和留苏预备部分党委书记朱允一，并要将学生带到街上，煽动市民起来与学生共同行动。但是，在群众的揭露下，右派分子的这次罪恶的密谋活动破产了。
    张西神、黄如柏一面污蔑党委领导整风没有信心，一面把他们商定好了的一个所谓“整风核心小组”名单，向留苏预备部教员党支部提出，威胁支部考虑，“这个名单”，企图用群众的压力迫使党委放弃领导权。
    张西神污蔑北京俄语学院党委是“乌七八糟一团”，“宗派主义那里都有，党员互相包庇，大小官僚平时一声不响，现在乘反右派大肆报复”。他还诋毁我国社会主义制度，又说胡风不是反革命分子。张西神与院部党内右派分子谢林密切配合，疯狂向党进攻。他和黄如柏煽动勤工人员和印刷工人“吐苦水”，替他们写大字报，歪曲工人的原意，大肆渲染。
    谢林是教师进修班十四班党支部书记。他在整风运动中，煽动群众“吐苦水”。进修班师生在他的煽动下，成立了“小组织”，确定了“秘书长”、“检查组”的成员，和谁搞大字报、谁跟报社联系等。谢林等三人起草发表“宣言”攻击党委，说“党委对整风表示冷淡，放弃领导”、“领导干部之间互相袒护”。谢林先后三次煽动进修班的教师到留苏预备部点火。张西神在光明日报发表的污蔑俄语学院和党委的文章，谢林事前看过，还在稿件上签字，证明张的文章是事实。
    谢林出卖党内秘密，与张西神订立攻守同盟。监委找他谈话，他污蔑为“三堂会审”，事后把谈话内容告诉张西神。
    现在，谢林的反党言行受到了严厉的驳斥，一时被蒙混的少数人，也都清醒过来，作了检讨和揭发。
