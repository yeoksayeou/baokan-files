Xinhua News Agency, 9th Dispatch: Rightist Zeng Yanxiu was originally a class alien element who had long opposed the Party and opposed Marxism-Leninism, mixed into the Party. His true colors have been fully exposed at the capital publishing industry symposium held on the 9th.

Chen Yuan, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the People's Publishing House, revealed at the meeting that Zeng Yanxiu's, as deputy director of the People's Publishing House, counter-Party thinking had its historical roots. This rightist, not long after sneaking into the Party in 1938, expressed "disgust with all aspects of Party life." As early as 1943, Zeng Yanxiu himself said: "My relationship with the Party is actually like a few drops of oil floating on water, not integrated at all; nominally a party member, but not actually a party member." He also said that his life in the Party had "three bitter things: first, group meetings; second, individual talks specifically to educate new party members; and third, Party Day." He also stated that his purpose in participating in the revolution and joining the Party was "fame first, interest second, and the needs of the Party third." Chen Yuan said that Zeng Yanxiu, who today uses the guise of opposing dogmatism to smuggle in counter-Marxist-Leninist contraband, his aversion to and hatred of Marxism-Leninism are also deeply rooted. In 1941, he wrote several extremely vicious doggerel poems to slander Marxism-Leninism. He wrote: "Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, every article is wonderful, I hate that I haven't memorized every article, every article is memorized until it is cooked and ready, Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, every article is good!" And: "The person who recites Marx and Lenin's articles is no better than a phonograph, specializing in the function of making dung." After liberation, when Zeng Yanxiu served as Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the CCP South China Bureau and concurrently as the Director of the Southern Daily from 1950 to 1953, he expressed "disgust" and adopted an "ignore it" attitude towards a conference held by the Propaganda Department of the CCP South China Bureau specifically to study how newspapers should strengthen Marxist-Leninist propaganda.

Zeng Yanxiu's distortion and malicious attacks on the Party and Party policies have also been a consistent manifestation of his behavior. In 1942, when he was working in the Jin-Sui (晉綏) Border Region, he distorted and exaggerated individual shortcomings, viewing the revolutionary base area as "completely dark," even saying that "the liberated areas are the same as the Kuomintang-controlled areas," "there is no principled difference," "the revolutionary base areas have no revolutionary flavor." Zeng Yanxiu, who today openly opposes agricultural collectivization, had already fully demonstrated his rich peasant line of thinking in 1942 when he conducted rural surveys in Jin-Sui, admitting that he "emphasized uniting with the middle peasants and utilizing the productive forces of the rich peasants, rather than emphasizing how to support the poor and hired peasants."

Chen Yuan pointed out in his speech that the Party had long discovered Zeng Yanxiu's long-standing counter-Party thinking and had given him long-term patient education, and also given him the opportunity to continue working and correct his mistakes. Under the Party's supervision and help, Zeng himself had also made some self-criticisms in previous political movements and ideological remolding movements. In the 1943 rectification movement, he said that his counter-Party thinking "if not changed, will one day separate from the revolution." Chen Yuan said that because Zeng Yanxiu had long adopted a double-dealing attitude, persisting in his mistakes and refusing to change, as Zeng Yanxiu said in his 1955 ideological self-criticism: "Superficially not expressing opinions, but going my own way, pretending to obey while acting contrary," hiding his counter-Party thinking deep in his soul, in this great storm of political and ideological socialist revolution, he finally revealed his true colors and was completely exposed.

### 反党思想在灵魂深处时时作怪  曾彦修原来是党内的阶级异己分子

    反党思想在灵魂深处时时作怪
    曾彦修原来是党内的阶级异己分子
    据新华社9日讯　右派分子曾彦修原来是一个长期反党和反马列主义的混在党内的阶级异己分子。他的本来面目已在9日举行的首都出版界座谈会上充分暴露。
    人民出版社副总编辑陈原在会上揭露，身为人民出版社副社长的曾彦修的反党思想是有他的历史根源的。这个右派分子在1938年混入党内不久，就表示“对全部党的生活已感到厌弃”。早在1943年时，曾彦修自己曾说：“我和党的关系，实际上是几点油花浮在水面上，根本没有融洽，名义上是党员，实际上不是党员。”他还说他在党内的生活“有三件苦事：一是小组会，二是专门教育新党员的个别谈话，三是党日。”‘他还曾表示他参加革命和入党的目的是“成名第一，兴趣第二，党的需要第三。”陈原说，今天打着反教条主义的幌子偷运反马列主义的私货的曾彦修，他对马列主义的厌恶和痛恨也是根深蒂固的。1941年时，他就写过几首极端恶毒的打油诗，污蔑马列主义。他写道：“马恩列斯条条妙，不背条条恨未消，条条背得翻锅熟，马恩列斯好条条！”还有：“马列条条背诵人，不比话匣高一等，机能造粪最专门。”解放后，曾彦修在1950年到1953年任职中共华南分局宣传部副部长兼南方日报社长期间，他对中共华南局宣传部召开的一次专门研究报纸如何加强马列主义宣传的会议，表示“反感”，采取“爱理不理”的态度。
    曾彦修对党和党的政策的歪曲和恶意攻击，也是他的一贯表现。1942年他在晋西北解放区工作时，就曾歪曲和夸大个别缺点，把革命根据地看做“漆黑一团”，甚至说“解放区和国民党统治区一样”，“没有原则性区别”，“革命根据地没有什么革命味道”。今天公然反对农业合作化的曾彦修，在1942年他在晋西北作农村调查时，就已经充分表明了他的富农路线的思想，他承认他是“强调团结中农和利用富农的生产力，而不强调如何扶助贫雇农。”
    陈原在发言中指出，对曾彦修长期存在的反党思想，党本来早已发现，对他进行了长期的耐心教育，并给继续工作和改正错误的机会。在党的督促和帮助下，曾本人也曾在历次政治运动和思想改造运动中，作了一些检查。在1943年的整风运动中，他就曾说他的反党思想“如不改变，终有一天是会和革命脱离的”。陈原说，但是，由于曾彦修长期采取两面派态度，坚持错误不改，像曾彦修在1955年思想检查时所说的：“表面上不表示意见，但却我行我素，阳奉阴违”，把他的反党思想隐藏在自己的灵魂深处，在这次政治上和思想上的社会主义革命的大风浪中，他终于现出原形，彻底暴露了。
