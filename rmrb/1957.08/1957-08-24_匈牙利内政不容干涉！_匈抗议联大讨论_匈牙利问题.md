　　Hungary's internal affairs brook no interference!
　　Hungary protests UN General Assembly discussion of the "Hungarian Question"
    Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, August 23rd: The Hungarian Foreign Ministry's Information Department issued a statement on August 22nd saying: The Hungarian Foreign Ministry believes that convening a special session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the so-called "Hungarian question" is illegal, and once again protests the discussion at the United Nations of the counter-revolutionary events that occurred in Hungary last autumn. (According to an announcement by the United Nations Secretary-General on the 20th of this month, a special session of the United Nations General Assembly will be convened on September 10th to discuss the so-called "Hungarian question." The Secretariat did not convene the General Committee but merely made a written inquiry to the members before making this decision. The Soviet representative expressed opposition, and the representatives of India and Egypt also opposed continuing the discussion, but Western countries, at the instigation of the United States, insisted on holding this meeting.) The statement demanded that the so-called "Hungarian question" be removed from the agenda. The statement pointed out that all the Hungarian people actively support this demand. The numerous mass rallies held in Hungary refuting the report of the so-called "United Nations Special Committee on the Hungarian Question," as well as the thousands of protest telegrams from workers, peasants, and intellectuals requesting the Foreign Ministry to forward them to the United Nations Secretary-General, prove this point.
    The Hungarian Foreign Ministry reiterated that the Hungarian government considers the issue of the Hungarian counter-revolutionary events to be purely an internal affair of Hungary. The Hungarian government protests foreign interference in its internal affairs and believes that every attempt at interference is a grave insult to the sovereignty of the Hungarian People's Republic, and the Hungarian government cannot tolerate outsiders deciding on views concerning our country's issues.
    The statement pointed out that the United States raised the so-called "Hungarian question" on the United Nations agenda in order to continue its slander campaign against Hungary, attempting to divert public opinion from the crimes of the imperialists against the people of the Near East in the past and present. The statement said that if the member states of the United Nations truly respect the spirit and letter of the United Nations Charter, then they must pay attention to the imperialist acts of aggression in Algeria, Cyprus, and Oman, and must reject the report of the "United Nations Special Committee on the Hungarian Question," which attempts to grossly interfere in the internal affairs of the Hungarian People's Republic.
    The Foreign Ministry's statement concluded by saying that the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government will express its views at the appropriate time on the report of the "Five-Nation Committee" which was illegally established to study the so-called "Hungarian question."

　　匈牙利内政不容干涉！
　　匈抗议联大讨论“匈牙利问题”
    新华社布达佩斯23日电　匈牙利外交部新闻司8月22日发表声明说：匈牙利外交部认为，召开联合国大会特别会议来讨论所谓“匈牙利问题”是不合法的，并且再一次抗议在联合国讨论关于匈牙利去年秋天发生的反革命事件问题（按联合国秘书处于本月20日宣布，联合国大会特别会议将在9月10日召开，讨论所谓“匈牙利问题”。秘书处并没有召集总务委员会而仅仅对委员进行书面询问即下此决定。苏联代表表示反对，印度、埃及两国代表也反对继续讨论，只是在美国怂恿下的西方国家坚持要召开这次会议。）声明要求从议程中撤销所谓“匈牙利问题”。声明指出，全体匈牙利人民都积极支持这个要求。在匈牙利国内举行的许多驳斥所谓“联合国匈牙利问题特别委员会”的报告的群众大会，以及工人、农民和知识分子要求外交部转给联合国秘书长的数千份抗议电报就证明了这一点。
    匈牙利外交部再次声明，匈牙利政府认为，匈牙利反革命事件的问题纯粹是匈牙利的内部事务。匈牙利政府抗议外人干涉它的内政，并且认为每一个干涉的企图都是对匈牙利人民共和国主权的莫大侮辱，匈牙利政府不能容忍由外人决定有关我国问题的观点。
    声明指出，美国把所谓“匈牙利问题”提上联合国议程，是为了借此继续进行反对匈牙利的诽谤运动，企图转移舆论的视线，使它们不注意帝国主义者过去和现在反对近东人民的罪行。声明说，如果联合国的会员国真正尊重联合国宪章的精神和文字的话，那末它们必须注意在阿尔及利亚、塞浦路斯和阿曼的帝国主义侵略行动，并且必须拒绝“联合国匈牙利问题特别委员会”企图粗暴地干涉匈牙利人民共和国内政的报告。
    外交部的声明最后说，匈牙利工农革命政府将在适当的时候就为研究所谓“匈牙利问题”而非法成立的“五国委员会”的报告表示自己的看法。
