Not Letting a Single Rightist Hide in a Bunker: Achievements in Liaoning's Search Work

(Our newspaper, Shenyang) By mid-August, the anti-Rightist struggle in Liaoning Province had been fully launched in ten large and medium-sized cities.

The anti-Rightist struggle in Liaoning Province began in early June. In the initial stage, the progress of the struggle was relatively slow. This was mainly due to paralysis in the thinking of the leadership and the existence of a tendency towards leniency. Some leading cadres in some units were apathetic towards the Rightists, had a poor sense of smell, weak fighting spirit, and lacked determination; they did not personally direct the battle. Some units wanted to call it quits as soon as the fight began; others were reluctant to part with talent, and the struggle was not ruthless, wanting to end the fight as soon as the Rightists made a self-criticism. Some only attacked obvious Rightists and did not pay attention to unearthing hidden Rightists. In particular, they were lenient and accommodating towards Rightists within the Party. After the Provincial Party Committee's inspection, all units criticized right-leaning paralysis and tendencies towards leniency, and deeply mobilized the masses. Since early July, the situation of the anti-Rightist struggle in the province has developed very rapidly. Many previously backward areas, industries, and units have now caught up. According to statistics on August 12, the number of units in Fushun, Benxi, Fuxin, and Jinzhou that had joined the anti-Rightist struggle had increased from 79 to 160. In the units under the Liaoning Provincial People's Committee, only six or seven Rightists were discovered before July 10, but now the number of Rightists who have been dug out and confirmed has reached one hundred. In Anshan City, which has a contingent of over 10,000 intellectuals, it was believed at the end of June that there were only seven Rightists in the entire city, but now, in the city's Black Metallurgical Design Institute alone, there are fourteen Rightists. After fierce anti-Rightist struggles, some universities, newspapers, and radio stations successively exposed Chen Shangjiong, a lecturer in the Mechanical Engineering Department of Northeast Institute of Technology who attempted to drive the Party out of the school, and Sun Bei of Shenyang Daily, Li Huizhong of Anshan Daily, Li Xingwen of Andong Daily, and Zhang Xiaohu of Liaoning Radio Station, who vainly attempted to seize leadership of the news media.

Deeply mobilizing the masses and adopting various flexible methods of excavation to ruthlessly search out the Rightists from various "air-raid shelters" one by one is an important experience for Liaoning Province in pushing the anti-Rightist struggle to a climax. Units that were originally thought to have no Rightists, such as the Education Department of the Provincial People's Committee, the Political and Legal Department of the Provincial Party Committee, and the Shenyang Coal Mine Administration, have now been exposed through deep excavation. Some disguised "behind-the-scenes strategists," such as Pan Baoxin, an engineer at the Copper, Lead, and Zinc Mining Bureau, who was previously an "advanced worker" and did not speak out during the great blooming and contending, has been revealed to be a venomous fellow. Some Rightists who were originally only known as "solo operators" were also finally found to be a small clique. For example, Wu Zheng, the deputy director of the Yingkou City Health Bureau, was originally thought to be a "solo operator," but in fact, he was the leader of six Rightists. These facts prove that although many Rightists did not openly express many anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds at the meetings during the great blooming and contending period, they were constantly stirring up trouble and sabotaging behind the scenes in peacetime. As long as we can be good at seeing the signs and tracking them down in various occasions and among their confidants, the Rightists will not be able to escape. As the struggle deepened, some people who had tendencies towards leniency or who had been misled by the Rightists and followed them gradually drew a clear line between themselves and the Rightists, actively joined the battle, and resisted more monsters and demons. Wang Zhenqing, a doctor at Benxi Workers' Hospital, sharpened his eyes and ruthlessly exposed the reactionary words and deeds of Guan Linru and others. Engineering and technical personnel at the Nanfen Mining General Plant exposed the despicable behavior of the Rightists in using various means to win them over.

Since early July, from the perspective of the whole province, the tendency towards leniency has been greatly overcome, but this does not mean that the tendency towards leniency is no longer worthy of attention. The tendency towards leniency is still the main obstacle affecting the continued in-depth development of the anti-Rightist struggle in Liaoning. The main manifestations of the current tendency towards leniency are: people are still hesitant and have many concerns about more responsible cadres; some people hold a sense of pity for so-called "talented" people and do not want to touch them. These have had a certain impact on the in-depth development of the anti-Rightist struggle. At the same time, some units have also experienced some hasty and rough phenomena in the struggle recently. Some have insufficient reasoning and rely solely on momentum to overwhelm people; others have regarded those who sharply criticize the leadership as Rightists. The Provincial Party Committee has instructed that these problems must be quickly corrected.

    不让一个右派分子藏在地洞里
    辽宁搜索工作取得成绩
    本报沈阳讯  到8月中旬，辽宁全省的反右派斗争已在十个大中城市中全面展开。
    辽宁省的反右派斗争是在6月上旬开始的。在起初的一个阶段，斗争的进展比较迟缓。这主要是由于领导思想上麻痹，有温情主义。有的单位的领导干部，对右派分子麻木不仁，嗅觉不灵，斗志不强，决心不大，没有亲自指挥战斗。有的单位斗争刚接火，就想收兵；有的是恋情惜才，斗争不狠，右派分子一检讨，就想收兵。有的光打明显的右派分子，不注意挖掘隐蔽的右派分子。特别是对党内的右派分子姑息迁就。这种情绪，经过省委的检查，各单位批判了右倾麻痹思想和温情主义，深入发动群众，从7月上旬以来，全省反右派斗争的形势有了十分迅速的开展。很多原来落后的地区，落后的行业和单位，现在都迎头赶上来了。据8月12日的统计，抚顺、本溪、阜新、锦州四个市投入反右派斗争的单位已由七十九个发展到一百六十个。省人民委员会所属单位，7月10日以前，只发现了六、七个右派分子，现在被挖出并确定的右派分子已达一百个。拥有一万多知识分子队伍的鞍山市，6月底以前，认为全市右派分子只有七人，而现在，仅仅只是该市黑色冶金设计院一个单位，就出来十四个右派分子。有些大专学校、报纸、电台，经过了激烈的反右派斗争，先后揭露了企图把党赶出学校的东北工学院机械系讲师陈尚炯，妄想夺取新闻机关领导权的沈阳日报的孙北、鞍山日报的李惠众、安东日报的李兴文、辽宁广播电台的张啸虎等。
    深入发动群众，机动灵活地采取各种各样挖掘的办法，把右派分子从各种“防空洞”里毫不留情的一个个搜索出来，这是辽宁省把反右派斗争推向高潮的一项重要的经验。原来认为没有右派分子的单位，像省人民委员会教育厅、省委政法部、沈阳煤矿管理局等许多单位，经过深掘深挖，现在都抓出来了。一些伪装起来的“幕后军师”，像铜铅锌矿务局工程师潘宝信，过去是个“先进工作者”，大鸣大放也没有发什么言，已被揭露，原来他是个阴毒的家伙。有的本来只知道是个“单干户”的右派分子，也最后查清原来还是一小撮。像营口市卫生局副局长吴铮，原来以为只是个“单干”的，实际上，他是六个右派分子的小头目。这些事实证明了不少右派分子在大鸣大放时期的会议上，虽然没有露骨地发表很多反共反社会主义的言行，但他们在平时没有不是背地里刮阴风，烧暗火的，只要能够善于在各种各样的场合下，在他们的知心朋友中，看出苗头，跟踪追击，右派分子还是跑不了的。随着斗争的深入，一些有温情主义或一些被右派分子迷惑而跟着他们跑的人，也逐渐同右派分子划清界限，积极投入战斗，抗击了更多的牛鬼蛇神。本溪职工医院医生王振清擦亮了眼睛以后，无情地揭发了关林如等人的反动言行。南芬矿山总厂的工程技术人员揭露了右派分子用各种手段拉拢他们的卑鄙行为。
    自从7月上旬以来，从全省来说，温情主义已经有了很大的克服，但这并不能说现在温情主义可以不必值得注意了。温情主义目前还是影响辽宁反右派斗争继续深入发展的主要障碍，当前温情主义的主要表现是：对于比较负责的干部，人们还是踌躇不前，顾虑较多；对于所谓有“才能”的人，有些人抱着一种怜悯之心，不想触动。这些都使反右派斗争的深入发展受到了一定的影响。同时，有些单位最近在斗争中也出现了一些急躁粗暴的现象，有的说理不足，单靠声势压人；有的把对领导尖锐提意见的人也当成了右派。省委对于这些问题，已指示必须迅速纠正。
