    Victories Repeatedly Reported in the Anti-Rightist Struggle in Literary and Art Circles
    Jiang Feng Anti-Party Clique Exposed
    The Vast Majority of People in Art Circles Stand on the Side of the Party in the Struggle

    (Reported by this newspaper) The vast majority of people in art circles have already stood on the side of the Party, and the Jiang Feng anti-Party clique has begun to be smashed.

    Materials successively revealed in large and small meetings show that Jiang Feng, in his long-term anti-Party activities, gathered a group of rightist elements inside and outside the Party, forming an anti-Party clique. The members of this clique include Communist Party members who have degenerated politically or are in the process of degenerating, elements with serious dissatisfaction with the Party, political careerists in the art world, bourgeois painters who resist reform, and young painters and students who have long been influenced by Jiang Feng's anti-Party ideology. Jiang Feng also had close ties with members of the Ding Ling and Chen Qixia anti-Party clique.

    This anti-Party clique has established strongholds in many art institutions in Beijing, Hangzhou, Shenyang, Shanghai, Chongqing, and other places. Each stronghold has Jiang Feng's own "cadres." The Jiang Feng anti-Party clique used the schools, publications, exhibition work committees, studios, training classes, and other organizations they controlled to resist the Party's policies and undermine the unity of the art world. They also used these organizations as places to gather anti-Party elements.

    Central Academy of Fine Arts Became an "Independent Kingdom"

    The Central Academy of Fine Arts has long been an "independent kingdom" under Jiang Feng's rule. Many important policies and guidelines of the Party could not meet the masses for a long time. On one occasion, when the Ministry of Culture sent people to the school, Wang Manshuo, the Party branch secretary and vice president of the Academy of Fine Arts, refused to receive them. The Party organization of the Academy of Fine Arts, manipulated by anti-Party elements such as Jiang Feng, also actually deteriorated and became Jiang Feng's anti-Party tool. In the early stage of the rectification campaign, the Party organization was used to launch a frenzied attack on the Ministry of Culture; after the start of the anti-rightist struggle, Party organization leaders Jiang Feng, Wang Manshuo, Hong Bo, and others also attempted to obstruct the development of the movement. They repeatedly claimed: "There are no rightist elements in the academy." More than a dozen professors of the Central Academy of Fine Arts jointly exposed that the China Democratic League branch had also become Jiang Feng's anti-Party tool. Wang Xun, chairman of the China Democratic League branch, and Li Zongjin, the organization committee member, were the "military advisors" in Jiang Feng's anti-Party clique. The personnel plan to drive away Party members, formulated by the rightist element Pang Xunqin of the Central Academy of Arts and Design, received strong support from Jiang Feng. When Pang Xunqin's anti-Party face was exposed, the people in Jiang Feng's anti-Party clique panicked. They shouted that they would "risk losing their Party membership" to "protect" Pang Xunqin and threatened the Beijing Municipal Party Committee not to publish Pang's crimes in the newspaper.

    Turning Fine Arts Monthly into an Anti-Party Coterie Publication

    Jiang Feng also attempted to expand his personal political capital and organize some "painting societies" to put on a "rival show" with the Artists Association. Jiang Feng once discussed with Wang Xun the idea of ​​tampering with the political direction of the "Fine Arts" monthly magazine and turning it into a coterie publication to promote their anti-Party ideas. People in the Jiang Feng anti-Party clique also planned to organize a coterie publishing house behind the Party's back to contend with the state publishing house. Facts have proven that the publication "Fine Arts Research," which was controlled by this anti-Party clique, had once carried out an encirclement and suppression of traditional Chinese painting.

    Supporting the Ding and Chen Anti-Party Clique in Attacking the Party

    It was revealed at the meeting that the Hungarian incident was a great encouragement to this anti-Party clique. Chen Qixia at that time estimated the situation to Jiang Feng, saying: "The work of the parties in all countries will have to change in the future." People in the Jiang Feng group supported Ding Ling and Chen Qixia's conspiracy to reverse the verdict on their anti-Party activities in May of this year. Chen Qixia's "reversal report" to the Party Committee Secretary of the Propaganda Department had been read by Jiang Feng. In May of this year, Jiang Feng and Chen Qixia talked at Ai Qing's home about mobilizing Xiao Jun to come out and "fight for it." They also criticized Xiao Jun's anti-Party activities as "folksy" and lacking strategy. On one occasion, Jiang Feng, Ding Ling, Ai Qing, and others gathered at the Beijing Hotel. One of the Jiang Feng anti-Party clique members present became so proud that he called themselves the "Petőfi Club." Jiang Feng repeatedly promoted the "benefits" of great democracy to others. He once promoted that "Marxism-Leninism is not eternal truth." Wo Zha revealed that Jiang Feng had said to him: "The disparity between urban and rural life is too great now. As long as there is a call, tens of thousands of people will rise up!"

    In the past half month, the Ministry of Culture has successively held seven symposiums for art workers. More and more people are asking to participate and speak, and the materials revealed are becoming more and more extensive. The last two symposiums were moved to the Central Academy of Fine Arts, which was regarded as an independent kingdom by Jiang Feng, and all teachers and students of the academy participated in the symposium. During this period, the Central Academy of Fine Arts also held hundreds of large and small debates. The vast majority of people in the art world distinguished right from wrong in the struggle. Many professors and students who had been deceived and misled by Jiang Feng have also recognized the truth about Jiang Feng's anti-Party activities and actively joined the battle. Big-character posters and cartoons chasing after the Jiang Feng anti-Party clique were plastered all over the walls of the Academy of Fine Arts.

    Now, Jiang Feng has begun to admit that he has degenerated into "a ferocious anti-Party element," but he has not thoroughly confessed his anti-Party words and deeds to the Party. The artists of the capital, all the teachers and students of the Central Academy of Fine Arts, and art workers from all over the country who have successively come to Beijing have formed a united front and are fighting to completely break down this anti-Party clique.

    文艺界反右派斗争捷报频传
    江丰反党集团败露
    美术界绝大多数人在斗争中站到党的方面
    本报讯　美术界绝大多数的人已经站在党这一边，江丰反党集团已开始被击破。
    在大会和小会上陆续揭露的材料说明，江丰在长期的反党活动中，纠集党内党外的一批右派分子，形成了一个反党集团。这个集团的成员，有政治上蜕化了或正在蜕化的共产党员，有严重对党不满的分子，有美术界的政治野心家，有抗拒改造的资产阶级画家，有长期受着江丰反党思想影响的青年画家和学生。江丰同丁玲、陈企霞反党集团的成员，也有密切的联系。
    这个反党集团在北京、杭州、沈阳、上海、重庆等地的许多美术机构里扎下了据点。各个据点都有江丰自己的“干部”。江丰反党集团利用他们掌握的学校、刊物、展览工作委员会、画室、训练班等组织，对抗党的政策，破坏美术界的团结。他们还利用这些组织，作为纠集反党分子的场所。
    中央美术学院变成了“独立王国”
    中央美术学院久已成了江丰统治下的“独立王国”。党的许多重要政策方针，长时期不能同群众见面。有一次文化部派人到学校去，美院党总支书记、副院长王曼硕竟拒不接纳。美院的党组织，在反党分子江丰等的操纵下，也实际上变了质，成为江丰的反党工具。整风初期，党组织被利用来向文化部发动猖狂进攻；反右派斗争开始后，党组织领导人江丰、王曼硕、洪波等又妄图阻挠运动的开展。他们再三宣称：“院内没有右派分子。”中央美术学院十多个教授联名揭发：民盟支部也成了江丰的反党工具。民盟支部主任委员王逊和组织委员李宗津，就是江丰反党集团里的“军师”。中央工艺美术学院右派分子庞熏琴制订的赶走党员的人事方案，得到江丰的有力支持。当庞熏琴的反党面目暴露以后，江丰反党集团的人惊慌失措，他们叫喊着“拚着丢掉党票”也要“保护”庞熏琴，要挟北京市委不要在报上公布庞的罪行。
    把美术月刊变成反党的同人刊物
    江丰还企图扩大个人的政治资本，组织一些“画会”来同美协唱“对台戏”。江丰曾与王逊商量，要篡改“美术”月刊的政治方向，把它办成一个同人刊物，宣传他们的反党思想。江丰反党集团的人还背着党打算组织同人出版社来同国家出版社抗争。事实已经证明，这个反党集团所把持的刊物“美术研究”，就曾经向国画进行围剿。
    支持丁、陈反党集团向党进攻
    会上揭露，匈牙利事件对于这个反党集团是一个很大的鼓励。陈企霞当时向江丰估计形势说：“今后各国党的工作都要改变。”江丰集团的人支持丁玲、陈企霞在今年5月企图为他们的反党活动事件翻案的阴谋。陈企霞写给中宣部党委书记的“翻案报告”，曾经江丰看过。今年5月，江丰和陈企霞在艾青家中谈到，要动员萧军出来“争一争”，他们还批评萧军的反党活动是“老百姓式”的，不讲策略。有一次，江丰、丁玲、艾青等人在北京饭店聚会，当时在座的江丰反党集团的有一个人，竟得意忘形地自称他们是“裴多菲俱乐部”。江丰曾多次向人宣传大民主的“好处”。他曾宣传“马列主义不是永恒的真理”。沃渣揭发，江丰曾向他说过：“现在城乡生活悬殊太大，只要一号召，就有几万人会起来！”
    半月以来，文化部连续召开了七次美术工作者座谈会。要求参加和发言的人越来越多，揭发的材料也越来越广泛。最近两次座谈会，移到了被江丰当作独立王国的中央美术学院举行，全院师生都参加了座谈会。中央美术学院在这期间还举行了数以百计的大小辩论会。美术界绝大多数人在斗争中辨明了大是大非。许多曾经受过江丰蒙蔽和欺骗的教授和学生，也已认清了江丰反党的真相，积极投入了战斗。美院墙上到处贴满了追击江丰反党集团的大字报和漫画。
    现在，江丰开始承认自己已经堕落成为“一个凶恶的反党分子”，但是他并未彻底向党交代自己的反党言行。首都的美术家们、中央美术学院全体师生以及陆续来到北京的各地美术界人士，结成了一条联合战线，正在为彻底攻破这个反党集团而斗争。
