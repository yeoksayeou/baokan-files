Revisiting Jiajiazhuang

    The two old photographs here were taken by a reporter in Jiajiazhuang, Yongchang County, Gansu Province, before the land reform. At that time, the vast majority of peasants in the village relied on wild vegetables for three or four months of the year. Six years later, the reporter revisited Jiajiazhuang, and the situation has completely changed, the poor village has become a rich village.

    Rightists clamor that "peasants' lives have not improved" and "the countryside is as poor as it was in the past"... The facts here expose their lies.

    Before the land reform, the peasants of Jiajiazhuang couldn't even afford pants to wear in the winter.

    "Every household has new quilts and every family has surplus grain" is the life of the members of the Jiajiazhuang Agricultural Cooperative today. Before liberation, the landlords of Jiajiazhuang built a "stockaded village" to oppress the peasants, who called it "the gate of hell." This is what the reporter photographed on the eve of the land reform. Today, the Jiajiazhuang Agricultural Cooperative has converted the "stockaded village" into a library.

    重访焦家庄
    这里的两张旧照片，是土地改革前记者在甘肃省永昌县焦家庄拍摄的。那时候，庄里的绝大多数农民一年里有三、四个月靠吃野菜过活。六年后的今天，记者重访焦家庄，情况完全变了，穷村已经成为富村。
    右派分子口口声声说“农民生活没有改善”，“农村和过去一样贫困”……，这里的事实，揭穿了他们的谎言。
    土地改革前，焦家庄农民冬天连裤子都穿不上。
    “户户添新被、家家有余粮”是焦家庄农业社社员今天的生活。解放前，焦家庄的地主修筑“寨子”欺压农民，农民称它“鬼门关”。这是记者在土地改革前夕拍摄的。今天，焦家庄农业社把“寨子”改为图书室了。                  司　马摄（新华社稿）
