To Create a Mass Base and Theoretical Basis for Resisting the Party's Policies
Li Zongjin and Wang Xun were the "Military Advisors" of the Jiang Feng Group

This newspaper reports that Li Zongjin and Wang Xun, key members of the Jiang Feng anti-Party group, have been exposed for engaging in anti-communist and anti-socialist activities through the China Democratic League (CDL) organization. The revealed materials show that Li Zongjin and Wang Xun were the "military advisors" and "theoreticians" of the Jiang Feng anti-Party group.

Li Zongjin and Wang Xun were both professors at the Central Academy of Fine Arts. Wang Xun was the chairman of the Academy's CDL branch, and Li Zongjin was the organization committee member. These two rightist elements played an important role in the reactionary "May Conference" (the climax of the attack on the Party launched by the rightist elements in the art circles, led by Jiang Feng). They were not only participants in this conference, but also active organizers and planners. The planning of this conference took place at Li Zongjin's home on one occasion. Participants included Jiang Feng, Yan Han, Hong Bo, Dong Xiwen, and others. Long before the conference, Li Zongjin and Wang Xun used every opportunity to oppose the Party's policies on traditional Chinese painting. At CDL meetings, teaching conferences, academic conferences, and in publications such as "Fine Arts Research," they used the excuse of academic discussion to attack the prestige of the Artists Association and the Ministry of Culture. The "Literary and Art Salon" held by the CDL at the Academy of Fine Arts became the center for consolidating Jiang Feng's anti-Party literary and artistic thought. At the "May Conference," Wang Xun attacked the People's Daily and leading comrades of the Ministry of Culture, describing the measures taken by the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee and the Ministry of Culture to improve traditional Chinese painting work according to Chairman Mao's instructions as "attacking Jiang Feng" and "a gust of wind." Li Zongjin praised anti-Party element Jiang Feng at the meeting, describing Jiang Feng as the only "leader" who was "most diligently and practically working for the new China's art cause and for implementing Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policies." After the "May Conference," Wang Xun used his authority in the editorial department of the "Fine Arts" monthly to repeatedly argue for reducing the length of painting pages and publishing the conference records in full in the "Fine Arts" monthly, intending to ignite anti-Party flames in the national art community.

Contrary to the Party's policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," Wang Xun openly put forward the reactionary slogan of "prior supervision" to contend with the Party. The so-called "prior supervision" meant that all major measures in the academy had to be approved by the CDL in advance. They attempted to replace the Party with the CDL. In fact, with Jiang Feng's support, they had long interfered with the work of various departments of the Academy of Fine Arts, and even personnel arrangements, through the CDL. Most viciously, they even attempted to interfere in Party affairs under the pretext: Wang Xun described Jiang Feng's anti-Party activities as a "factional struggle" between Jiang Feng and the responsible comrades of the Artists Association, and they even declared that the CDL should come forward to mediate the "factional struggle" within the Communist Party. Their organizational work was carried out according to the instructions of Feng Yidai, a rightist element in the CDL Municipal Committee. Before the rectification campaign, Feng Yidai came to the Academy to "instruct" work, criticizing them for being "backward" in developing CDL members and for "artificially raising the conditions"; subsequently, Li Zongjin, Wang Xun, and others began to unscrupulously develop CDL members among middle and senior teaching staff throughout the academy. Li Zongjin and Wang Xun's reactionary activities using the CDL were highly appreciated by Jiang Feng. Jiang Feng's plan to run the academy on a "joint public-private" basis was first solicited for opinions within the CDL. Jiang Feng's anti-Party articles were all reviewed by Li Zongjin and Wang Xun before publication. Jiang Feng also entrusted the CDL to do a good job in united front work. Li Zongjin could also see confidential Party documents through rightist elements within the Party. Li Zongjin and Wang Xun said: "When Jiang Feng's will cannot be implemented, the CDL should play a role."

Li Zongjin was consistently arrogant and domineering within the academy. He often said: "Jiang Feng's opinion is my opinion; my opinion is Jiang Feng's opinion." He used the CDL organization to force CDL members to "unify their understanding of traditional Chinese painting," creating a mass base for Jiang Feng to resist the Party's policies on traditional Chinese painting. At some academic conferences convened by the CDL for this purpose, only Li Zongjin and others were allowed to peddle their nihilistic ideas about national heritage. Anyone who disagreed with them was suppressed from speaking and subjected to attacks. They also called CDL members who accepted the Party's policies and were willing to change their erroneous views "wavering." Li Zongjin was the most courageous "gunner" in promoting fallacies such as "traditional Chinese painting is unscientific" and "traditional Chinese painting cannot reflect life." Jiang Feng made an opportunist conclusion on the art cause led by the Party in the past year, saying that it was "one step forward, two steps back." Li Zongjin wanted to mobilize the forces within the CDL to compile art materials from the past year to prove the "correctness" of Jiang Feng's conclusion. Because Professor Zhang Ding of the Colored Ink Painting Department disagreed with their nihilistic ideas, Li Zongjin attacked Zhang. Li Zongjin also used teaching to spread poison. He promoted to students that the art cause was "not as good as before," saying that artistic skills had declined after liberation, which was an "undeniable objective fact" because painters had to consider the Party's policies when painting. He praised rightist elements Qian Weichang for being "responsible for science," Fei Xiaotong for being "kind-hearted," and Li Zongen for being "diligent in his work." He even promoted to students that Hu Shi was mainly a scholar. Why did Li Zongjin vigorously promote these people? It turned out that they were a gang. A former student of Li Zongjin wrote a letter to the Central Academy of Fine Arts rectification leading group, exposing his ugly history: Li Zongjin came from a bureaucratic landlord family. Before liberation, he had painted full-body portraits of Chiang Kai-shek and oil paintings of him riding a horse with a saber, praising this public enemy of the people. When Chiang Kai-shek launched a youth campaign to join the youth army, Li Zongjin even went to students' homes to do propaganda and mobilization.

At the art community symposium, the masses tore off Wang Xun's "scholar" mask. Wang Xun was Jiang Feng's "brain trust." When Jiang Feng opposed the Party's literary and artistic policies, Wang Xun provided him with "theoretical" basis; when Jiang Feng slandered, fabricated rumors, and attacked the Party, Wang Xun supplied "bullets." In order to prove that Jiang Feng's opposition to traditional Chinese painting was correct, Wang Xun slandered that the painting heritage inherited by contemporary old Chinese painters was all "dross" and not "essence." When Comrade Zhou Yang convened a discussion with professors from the Academy of Fine Arts, he was not invited, but he prepared a set of speeches, asking the professors to defend Jiang Feng's anti-Party literary and artistic thought. Wang Xun had also consistently used the Party's cause to realize his personal ambitions. In 1953, the Ministry of Culture, in order to strengthen its leadership over traditional Chinese painting work, was preparing to establish the National Art Research Institute. With Jiang Feng's support, Wang Xun even used the staff of the research institute to collect materials for his art history research, turning the research institute into a data room serving his own research work.

### 为抗拒党的政策制造群众基础和理论根据　李宗津王逊是江丰集团的“军师”

　　为抗拒党的政策制造群众基础和理论根据
　　李宗津王逊是江丰集团的“军师”
    本报讯　江丰反党集团的骨干分子李宗津、王逊，通过民盟组织从事反共反社会主义的罪恶活动，已被揭发。从已揭露的材料说明，李宗津和王逊是江丰反党集团的“军师”和“理论家”。
    李宗津和王逊都是中央美术学院的教授。王逊是学院民盟支部的主任委员，李宗津是组织委员。这两个右派分子在反动的“五月会议”（以江丰为首的美术界右派分子发动的向党进攻的高潮）中起了重要作用。他们不仅是这次会议的参加者，而且是积极的组织者和谋划者。这次会议的策划工作，有一次是在李宗津家里进行的。参加者有江丰、彦涵、洪波、董希文等人。早在会议以前，李宗津、王逊就利用一切机会反对党对国画的政策。在盟的会议、教学会议、学术性会议以及“美术研究”等刊物上，借口学术讨论，打击美协和文化部的威信。民盟在美术学院举办的“文艺沙龙”，成了巩固江丰反党文艺思想的中心。在“五月会议”上，王逊攻击人民日报，攻击文化部领导同志，他把中宣部和文化部根据毛主席的指示改进国画工作的措施，说成是“打击江丰”，是“一阵风”。李宗津在会上吹捧反党分子江丰，他把江丰说成是“最辛勤、踏实地在为新中国美术事业，为贯彻毛主席的文艺方针而努力工作着”的唯一的“领导者”。“五月会议”以后，王逊曾利用职权在“美术”月刊编辑部再三争执，要缩减画页篇幅，将会议记录在“美术”月刊全文发表，打算在全国美术界煽起反党火焰。
    和党提出“长期共存、互相监督”的方针相反，王逊竟公然提出了“事先监督”的反动口号，来与党抗衡。所谓“事先监督”，就是学院中一切重大措施，都要事先取得盟的同意。他们妄图以盟代党。事实上在江丰支持下，他们早已通过盟干涉美院各系工作，甚至人事安排。最为恶毒的是他们还企图借故干涉党的事务：王逊把江丰的反党活动，说成是江丰和美协负责同志的“宗派斗争”，他们竟宣称：要由民盟出面，来调解共产党内的“宗派斗争”。他们的组织工作是按照民盟市委右派分子冯亦代的指示行事的。冯亦代在整风前曾到学院“指示”工作，批评他们发展盟员工作“落后”，“人为地提高了条件”；接着，李宗津、王逊等就着手在全院中、高级教学干部中不择手段地大发展。李宗津、王逊利用民盟进行的反动活动，很受江丰赏识。江丰提出的“公私合营”办院计划，就曾先在盟内征求意见。江丰的反党文章，发表前都经李宗津、王逊看过。江丰还托盟搞好统战工作。李宗津通过党内右派分子，还可看到党内机密文件。李宗津、王逊说：“江丰的意志贯彻不下去时，盟应该起作用。”
    李宗津平日在学院内一贯飞扬跋扈。他常说：“江丰的意见，就是我的意见；我的意见，就是江丰的意见。”他利用民盟组织，强制盟员“统一对国画的认识”，为江丰抗拒党的国画政策制造群众基础。在盟为这个目的召集的一些学术性会议上，只许李宗津等人贩卖他们对民族遗产的虚无主义思想，凡是不同意他们意见的，就被压制发言，横加打击。他们还把接受党的政策，愿意改变自己错误看法的盟员，称作“动摇”。李宗津是宣传“国画不科学”“国画不能反映生活”等谬论的最勇猛的“炮手”。江丰对过去一年党领导的美术事业，作了“进一步、退二步”的机会主义的结论，李宗津就要发动盟内力量整理一年来的美术资料，来证明江丰结论的“正确”。由于彩墨画系教授张仃不同意他们的虚无主义思想，李宗津就对张打击。李宗津还利用教学散布毒素，他向学生宣传艺术事业“今不如昔”，说解放后艺术技巧衰落了，这是“不可否认的客观事实”，其原因是由于画家作画时要考虑党的政策。他向学生吹捧右派分子钱伟长“对科学负责”，费孝通“心地善良”，李宗恩“对业务刻苦努力”。他甚至向学生宣传说：胡适主要还是学者。李宗津为什么极力宣扬这些人呢，原来他们是一伙的。李宗津从前的一个学生，写信给中央美术学院整风领导小组，揭发了他的丑恶历史：李宗津出身官僚地主家庭。解放以前，曾给蒋介石画过全身像和骑马挂军刀的油画，歌颂这个人民的公敌。当蒋介石发动青年参加青年军时，李宗津还曾到学生家里去做宣传鼓动。
    在美术界座谈会上，群众撕下了王逊的“学者”面具。王逊是江丰的“智囊人物”。江丰反对党的文艺方针，王逊为他提供“理论”根据；江丰污蔑造谣攻击党的时候，王逊供给“子弹”。为了证明江丰反对国画是正确的，王逊污蔑说当代的老国画家继承的绘画遗产，所有的只是“糟粕”，不是“精华”。周扬同志召集美院教授谈话，没有请他，他却准备了一套发言内容，要教授们去为江丰的反党文艺思想辩护。王逊还一贯利用党的事业来实现个人的野心。1953年，文化部为了加强对国画工作的领导，筹备创立民族美术研究所。王逊在江丰的支持下，竟然利用研究所的工作人员，为他搜集美术史研究的资料，把研究所变成了为自己研究工作服务的资料室。
