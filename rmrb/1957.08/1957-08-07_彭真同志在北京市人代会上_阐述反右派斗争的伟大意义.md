    This Newspaper News – Peng Zhen Speaks at the Beijing Municipal People's Congress, Elaborating on the Great Significance of the Anti-Rightist Struggle
    This newspaper reports Comrade Peng Zhen spoke on the 4th at the Second Session of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Congress.

    Peng Zhen said that this meeting was very good, very serious, very intense, and also very lively. This is a meeting to further expose and criticize the reactionary words and deeds of the bourgeois rightists, a meeting to review work, decide on major current work plans, and improve work, a meeting to promote the continued deepening of the rectification movement, and also an educationally significant meeting.

    Peng Zhen first emphasized the nature of the anti-Rightist struggle and its great significance. He said that this is a nationwide great debate, a great political and ideological war, a struggle between the capitalist road and the socialist road, a struggle concerning the fate of 600 million people and the direction of social development in our country, a struggle with great historical and international significance. If we do not win this battle, socialism will not succeed.

    Peng Zhen pointed out that if the bourgeois rightists were to win this war, the people's democratic state led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, what the rightists call the "Party's world," would be shaken, even overthrown. He then asked rhetorically: If the state at that time did not want the working class to lead, then who would lead it? According to the wishful thinking of the bourgeois rightists, that is, their delusion, only the bourgeois rightist gentlemen could lead it. Can we imagine that a state led by anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist bourgeois rightists would still be based on the worker-peasant alliance? Of course, we cannot imagine it this way. Then, what class and class alliance would the rightists' "non-Party world" be based on? Everyone knows that in our country at this stage, apart from the working class and the peasantry, there are also the bourgeoisie and the landlord class. If it is not based on the worker-peasant alliance, it would be based on the landlord-bourgeois alliance. Peng Zhen continued, we only need to see that many of the backbone elements of the rightists who are frantically attacking the Party and the people this time are the targets of struggle in the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, the defeated heroes who were struggled against in the Five-Anti and Three-Anti movements, or their family members and relatives, and we can roughly judge. He said that from this it is not difficult to see what kind of "absolute democracy" and "absolute freedom" world would be established after they overthrew the people's world led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, that is, the "Party's world" that the rightists curse. Peng Zhen said that the rightist gentlemen only talk about opposing the "Party's world," but they are like the ghosts and monsters that operate at night, fearing and avoiding the sun, fearing to mention class and class analysis, fearing to explain that the "non-Party world" they would establish after overthrowing the "Party's world" is the world of those "non-laboring" classes and gentlemen. Because by exposing the class basis, the rightists would reveal their true colors under the demon-revealing mirror. However, the eyes of 600 million people are discerning, how can they be deceived? They underestimate the workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals too much.

    Peng Zhen pointed out sharply that the rightists concentrated their efforts on attacking the Party, wanting the Party to withdraw from leadership or temporarily withdraw from leadership, that is, "taking turns to be the landlord" and "taking turns to govern," which is a very vicious conspiracy. Peng Zhen said, "The lessons of the past are not far away." Before the "April 12th," "April 15th," and "July 15th" incidents in 1927, and even after the large-scale public massacre of Communists and revolutionary people, weren't Chiang Kai-shek, Wang Jingwei, and other anti-communist and counter-revolutionary "heroes" also saying that they were only opposed to the Communist Party? Weren't they also touting themselves as true revolutionaries? Didn't Hitler also rise to power by opposing communism? Even the Japanese imperialists said that their invasion of China was only for the sake of anti-communism? The rightists, like Chiang Kai-shek, Wang Jingwei, and other counter-revolutionaries, deeply know that if the Communist Party is brought down and the leadership of the Communist Party is abolished, the people will be easier to deal with, socialism will naturally not be achieved, and the bourgeois rightists' delusional restoration plot will be easier to realize. Therefore, the bourgeois rightists staked everything and tried every means to attack the Party and the Party's leadership, scolding the world led by the working class as the "Party's world," saying that the Party cannot lead science, education, literature, and art, cannot lead factories and enterprises... cannot lead this, cannot lead that, and want the Party's leadership to withdraw from schools, factories, enterprises... to withdraw from here, to withdraw from there. Then, is it okay for the Communist Party to return to the countryside? The rightist gentlemen said, "The Communist Party has forgotten the peasants after entering the city," and the peasants should be represented by Huang Shiren from "The White-Haired Girl." In order to expel the leadership of the Communist Party from all aspects, the rightists slandered the Communist Party as "worse than the Kuomintang," and everything is "a mess," the Five-Anti and Three-Anti movements are "a mess," and all construction is only allowed to talk about shortcomings and not allowed to talk about achievements, so naturally it is also "a mess."

    In short, the great victory of the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, and the great achievements of national construction, all seem to be "a mess." In this way, the Communist Party really deserves to be cut into a thousand pieces, the people really should rise up to "kill the Communist Party," the sky in China is about to change, and the Hungarian incident in China is about to rise up. He then said: I ask, is this a trivial matter that is not worth making a big deal of? Should we, like Chen Duxiu, "generously" "tolerate" the anti-communist, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary crimes of Chiang Kai-shek, Wang Jingwei, etc., tolerate the rampant attacks of the bourgeois rightists? Absolutely not. Of course, this does not mean that we now want to treat all rightists as Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei, but it shows the seriousness and viciousness of the rampant attacks of the rightists against the Party, the people, and socialism, as well as the viciousness of their methods.

    Peng Zhen said that the rightists' calculations are as wishful as can be. But unfortunately for them, today's Communist Party is not the Communist Party led by the opportunist Chen Duxiu thirty years ago, and today's Chinese people are not the people of thirty years ago, and will not be tricked by the bourgeois rightists like Chiang Kai-shek, Wang Jingwei, etc. back then. Now it is impossible for the rightists to overthrow the people's China led by the working class. "Those who understand the times are outstanding people," the rightist gentlemen should honestly raise their hands and lay down their weapons, and be determined to repent and honestly confess. It is still possible to land ashore if you turn back early now. We hope that the rightists will seriously examine themselves, honestly confess, and sincerely repent, and not persist in evil and cut themselves off from the people. At the same time, we want to solemnly tell them that this is a question of right and wrong, a question of good and evil, a question of who will win between socialism and capitalism, and our people, people's representatives, and the state cannot be ambiguous at all. All rightists who do not want to cut themselves off from the people should not harbor any illusions, thinking that they can muddle through. Know that carrying a burden and owing debts politically is not good for the country, the people, or themselves. Do not try to be clever and end up making a fool of yourselves, you should take care of yourselves.

    Peng Zhen then used the great revolutionary victories and great construction achievements obtained by our people to refute the bourgeois rightists' slander that everything of our people is "a mess." He also talked about the achievements and shortcomings in Beijing's work. Peng Zhen pointed out that our achievements are great and major, and there are many mistakes and shortcomings in our work, and some mistakes and shortcomings are very serious. But all in all, the errors and shortcomings are only partial, and compared with the achievements, they are incomparably small. The rightists are very disgusted and hateful of this conclusion and evaluation, which is completely in line with the objective situation, because it does not meet their reactionary demands. This is not only because the achievements of our people are bad luck and disaster for them, but also because if they recognize our achievements and recognize the truth, it will not be good to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party. But we cannot help but talk about the evaluation of our work in this way. This is not because we are "stingy" or "love to fight," but because it is a fact, the result of the common efforts of 600 million people.

    Peng Zhen talked about the achievements in several major aspects of industrial and agricultural production, cultural education, and municipal construction in the country and Beijing since liberation, as well as the great victory of the socialist revolution, and then he said that although our achievements are huge and the development speed of our various construction undertakings is very fast, because our country has suffered from imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism for a long time in the past, and the foundation is too weak, these achievements are far from meeting the current growing needs of the people, and the work is not "almost," but far from meeting the needs and ideals of the people. It is necessary for our country and all the people, all staff members, to build the country diligently and thriftily, run enterprises diligently and thriftily, run cooperatives diligently and thriftily, and run municipal administration, education, and other undertakings diligently and thriftily, and manage households diligently and thriftily; especially to concentrate efforts on developing industrial and agricultural production, first of all industrial production, because material production is the foundation of all undertakings. Resolutely and conscientiously improve our work style.

    Peng Zhen said that we say that our achievements are huge, but it does not mean that there are no errors and shortcomings in our work. There are many errors and shortcomings, and some are very serious. Therefore, on May 1 this year, the CPC Central Committee issued instructions on the rectification movement. After the start of the rectification movement, workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and other laborers put forward many constructive opinions, most of which are correct, and some are incorrect or not completely correct. But we express our gratitude and welcome to all opinions as long as they are well-intentioned, not malicious, constructive, not destructive. Some correct opinions have been accepted and used to improve the work.

    Peng Zhen then pointed out the main errors and shortcomings of some leading comrades and staff members inside and outside the Party in Beijing in their work and style, and pointed out that these errors and shortcomings are inseparable from the shortcomings in our leadership. He said:

    First, many comrades in the work lack the necessary contact with the workers and peasants, lack the habit of concentrating problems and opinions from them, studying and solving them, and then insisting on it, and even do not know what problems some workers, peasants, and other laborers have, what they are thinking, and even pay little attention to them. This is not a phenomenon that should exist among the working comrades in the capital of a socialist country led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. This is a principled shortcoming and error.

    Second, the political atmosphere in some agencies is thin, and some comrades have a dull political sense. They cannot detect major political problems in time, or even pay attention to them, so they cannot seize them in time, reflect them to the superior for resolution, or directly solve them themselves. Like the rampant attacks of the bourgeois rightists, people have been active for a long time, and some cadres are still confused, as if nothing has happened, or do not know the seriousness of the problem, or feel that it is not their business and can hang high, or vulgarly because they are afraid of offending people, that is, the rightists, they want to take a detached and neutral attitude, but they are not afraid of offending 600 million people. This is not the political attitude that our Party and state staff, especially leading cadres, in the capital should have, and it cannot be said that this is the performance of some progressive elements.

    Third, there is a lack of the working class's spirit of conscientiousness and responsibility and the vigor to resolutely overcome difficulties and completely solve problems in the work. Instead of searching, discovering, and grasping problems like a hungry tiger catching food, and earnestly studying and solving them to improve work and promote undertakings, they sometimes entangle in official matters and meetings for a long time, and the problems are not actually solved. Some people even have or rigidly maintain the bad bureaucratic style left over from the old regime and the old society. Instead of grasping the problem and solving it, they push the problem back and forth without solving it, or let the problems slip past their eyes and turn a blind eye, and even "strike away from the body" when encountering things, that is, they want to shirk responsibility. This is by no means a manifestation of serving the people wholeheartedly.

    Fourth, many comrades are not good at grasping typical examples from problems with universality, systematically solving them from the root, breaking through one point, and promoting the overall situation, but only solving the problems that are encountered in isolation.

    Fifth, some comrades easily think that their work has been done "almost" and are easily satisfied with the status quo. They do not demand themselves with the highest possible standards, but are complacent with a little achievement, or even if nothing goes wrong, and they do not have the emerging vigor of the working class, but are old and decadent.

    Sixth, there are too many staff members in the agencies and management personnel in the enterprises, and the organizations are too large. But some comrades think that the more people the better, the bigger the organizational structure the better, and it seems that the less a person does, the better, and the less the head of the organization personally does, the better.

    Peng Zhen said that in order to fundamentally and conscientiously improve the work style, to closely link the leading organs with the working masses, and to further establish the glorious atmosphere of labor and diligence among all the people in the capital, and to eliminate the bad habits of idleness, gluttony, and laziness left over from the old feudal consumer city by the exploiting classes and various parasitic elements, all people who can work and have the conditions for labor must engage in possible labor. In the future, in addition to cadres participating in some physical labor, we must also draw about 30% to 50% of the staff from the existing staff of various agencies and management personnel of various undertakings and enterprises to go to the grassroots units such as workshops, shops, farms, agricultural cooperatives, handicraft cooperatives, and streets to participate in production labor and grassroots work for a longer period of time. At the same time, mobilize and educate all citizens to improve the work and style of the capital and the style of the people from all walks of life in the capital to become the style of the socialist working people in accordance with the spirit of building the country diligently and thriftily, running the society diligently and thriftily, running enterprises diligently and thriftily, running all undertakings diligently and thriftily, and managing households diligently and thriftily. We believe that about 30,000 staff members should be transferred from the existing staff members of various agencies and enterprise management personnel to participate in production and grassroots work, and they can also be rotated and exchanged after a considerable period of time, such as two or three years.

    Peng Zhen finally said that we must resolutely and thoroughly smash the attacks of the bourgeois rightists. All bourgeois rightists should thoroughly confess, resolutely repent, and not persist in evil and cut themselves off from the people. Some people at the meeting have begun to confess honestly, which is very good and a good start. Those who have not confessed honestly should confess well, and there is no other way out. Those who are entangled with the rightists should draw a clear line with the rightists.

    Peng Zhen said that we must, like resolutely smashing the attacks of the bourgeois rightists, adopt the method of rectification, resolutely and conscientiously rectify the style of staff members in all aspects and the style of people from all walks of life, resolutely overcome the errors and shortcomings in our work, do a better job in various tasks in our capital, make various undertakings develop more rapidly, and gradually rectify the atmosphere of the masses of the people in the capital into a pure socialist atmosphere.

    彭真同志在北京市人代会上
    阐述反右派斗争的伟大意义
    本报讯　彭真同志4日在北京市第二届人民代表大会第二次会议上讲了话。
    彭真说，这次会议开得很好，很严肃、很紧张，也很活泼。这是进一步揭露和批判资产阶级右派反动言行的会议，是检查工作、决定当前工作大计、改进工作的会议，是推动整风运动继续深入的会议，也是一次富有教育意义的会议。
    彭真首先强调地讲了反右派斗争的性质和它的伟大意义。他说，这是一场全民的大论战，是一场伟大的政治战争和思想战争，是资本主义道路同社会主义道路的斗争，是一场关系六万万人的命运和我国社会发展方向的斗争，是一场具有伟大历史意义和国际意义的斗争，这一仗如果我们不打胜，社会主义就搞不成功。
    彭真指出，假如资产阶级右派在这场战争中得胜，工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家，即右派所谓“党天下”，就被动摇，以至被颠复。他接着反问：那时的国家，既不要工人阶级作领导，那末将由谁来领导呢？按照资产阶级右派的如意算盘，即他们的妄想，那时只能由资产阶级右派老爷们来领导了。能不能设想，反共、反人民、反社会主义的资产阶级右派领导的国家，还以工农联盟为基础呢？当然不能这样设想。那末右派的“非党天下”究竟将以什么阶级和阶级联盟为基础呢？谁都知道，现阶段我国除了工人阶级、农民阶级，就是资产阶级、地主阶级，如果不以工农联盟为基础，就得以地主资产阶级联盟为基础了。彭真接着说，我们只要看这次向党、向人民猖狂进攻的右派的骨干分子，有很多是民主革命、社会主义革命的斗争对象，是五大运动、三大改造中被斗争过的落魄英雄或者是他们的家属、亲友，就可大体判明。他说，从这里也不难看出，在他们颠复工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民的天下，即右派所咒骂的“党天下”以后，会建立什么人的“绝对民主”“绝对自由”的天下。彭真说，右派先生们只讲反对“党天下”，但是他们却像在夜间活动的阴魂鬼怪惧怕和躲避太阳一样，生怕提到阶级和阶级分析，生怕说明他们颠复“党天下”后所建立的“非党天下”，是那些“不劳而获”的阶级和老爷们的天下。因为戳穿阶级基础，右派就会在照妖镜下显露出原形。但是，六万万人的眼睛是雪亮的，怎能瞒得过去呢？他们太把工人、农民、革命知识分子“看扁了”。
    彭真痛切地指出右派集中力量攻击党，要党退出领导或暂时退出领导，即“要轮流坐庄”、“轮流执政”，是一个很毒辣的阴谋诡计。彭真说，“殷鉴不远”，1927年蒋介石、汪精卫等反共、反革命的“英雄”在“四·一二”“四·一五”“七·一五”以前，甚至在大规模地公开地屠杀共产党和革命人民以后，不也是说他们只是反对共产党吗？不也是把他们自己标榜为真革命吗？希特勒不也是以反共起家的么？连日本帝国主义者当日侵略中国不也说它只是为了反共么？右派分子也和蒋介石、汪精卫等反革命一样深深地知道，搞垮了共产党，取消了共产党的领导，人民就好对付了，社会主义自然就搞不成器了，资产阶级右派妄想的复辟阴谋就容易实现了。因此，资产阶级右派就破釜沉舟、千方百计地攻击党和党的领导，骂工人阶级领导的天下是“党天下”，说党不能领导科学、教育、文学、艺术，不能领导工厂、企业……不能领导这个，不能领导那个，要党的领导从学校、工厂、企业……从这里退出，从那里退出。那么，共产党能回农村好不好呢？右派先生们说“共产党进了城已经忘了农民”，农民应该由“白毛女”里的黄世仁来代表了。右派为了从各个方面驱逐共产党的领导，就诬蔑共产党“比国民党还坏”，一切“一团糟”，五大运动、三大改造“一团糟”，各项建设也只准讲缺点，不得讲成绩，那末自然也是“一团糟”了。
    总之，民主革命、社会主义革命的伟大胜利，国家建设的伟大成就，好像都是“一团糟”。这样共产党真该千刀万剐了，人民真该起来“杀共产党”了，中国的天要变了，中国的匈牙利事件就要起来了。他接着说：试问，这是一桩不值得大做文章的小题么？我们应该同陈独秀“宽洪大量”地“包容”蒋介石、汪精卫等的反共、反人民、反革命的罪行一样，容忍资产阶级右派的猖狂进攻么？绝对不能。当然，这并不是说现在我们要把所有右派分子当蒋介石、汪精卫对待，而是说右派反党、反人民、反社会主义的猖狂进攻性质的严重和恶劣，以及手段的毒辣。
    彭真说，右派的算盘是打得再如意没有了。但是对于他们不幸的是，今天的共产党已不是三十年前机会主义者陈独秀领导的共产党，今天的中国人民已不是三十年前的人民，不会像当日中蒋介石、汪精卫等的诡计那样，中资产阶级右派的诡计了。现在右派要颠复工人阶级领导的人民的中国已经不可能了。“识时务者为俊杰，”右派先生们还是老老实实，举起双手，放下武器吧，还是决心悔改、老实检讨交代吧。现在及早回头尚可上岸。我们希望右派分子好好检讨，老老实实交代和真诚悔改，不要怙恶不悛，自绝于人民。同时，我们要正告他们，这是大是大非、大善大恶的问题，是关系社会主义和资本主义谁胜谁败的问题，我们人民群众、人民代表和国家是丝毫都不能含糊的。凡是不愿自绝于人民的右派分子，不要妄存侥幸的心理，以为可以蒙混过关。须知政治上背着包袱，欠下债，对国家，对人民，对他们自己都没有好处，不要弄巧成拙，应该好自为之。
    彭真接着用我国人民获得的伟大的革命胜利，伟大的建设成绩，驳斥了资产阶级右派说我们人民的一切都是“一团糟”的诬蔑。他还说到了北京工作中的成绩和缺点的问题。彭真指出，我们的成绩是伟大的、主要的，工作中的错误、缺点也不少，并且有些错误、缺点是很严重的。但是总起来说，错误、缺点只是部分的，同成绩比起来，它是小得不可比拟的。右派分子因为这种完全符合客观情况的结论和估价，不合乎他们的反动要求，就对它十分讨厌，十分痛恨。这不仅因为我们人民的成绩对他们来说是倒霉，是灾难，而且因为他们如果承认了我们的成绩，承认了真理，就不好反对共产党的领导了。但是我们对工作的估价却不能不这样讲。这倒不是因为我们“小气”，“爱斗争”，而是因为它是事实，是六万万人共同努力的结果。
    彭真在谈了解放以来全国和北京市工农业生产、文化教育、市政建设上的几个主要方面的成就，以及社会主义革命的伟大胜利以后，他接着说，我们的成绩虽然是巨大的，我们各项建设事业发展的速度虽然是很快的，但是因为我们的国家过去长期受帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的灾害，底子太薄，这些成就还远不能满足目前人民日益增长的需要，工作不是“差不多”，而是离满足人民需要和理想还差得很多。需要我们国家和全体人民、全体工作人员勤俭建国，勤俭办企业，勤俭办合作社，勤俭办市政、教育等各种事业，勤俭持家；特别是要集中力量发展工农业生产，首先是工业生产，因为物质生产是一切事业的基础。坚决认真地改进我们的工作作风
    彭真说，我们说我们的成绩是巨大的，并不是说我们工作中没有错误和缺点了，我们的错误、缺点是很多的，有些并且是很严重的。因此，今年5月1日，中共中央发出了关于整风运动的指示。在整风运动开始以后，工人、农民、革命知识分子和其他劳动者提了很多建设性的意见，其中绝大多数是对的，也有些是不对或者不完全对的。但是一切意见只要是善意的，不是恶意的，是建设性的，不是破坏性的，我们都表示感谢欢迎。其中有些正确的意见已经被接受并且据以改进了工作。
    彭真接着指出了目前北京市党内外一些领导工作同志和工作人员在工作上、作风上的主要错误和缺点，并且指出这些错误和缺点是同我们在领导上的缺点分不开的。他说：
    一、有很多工作同志同工农群众缺乏应有的联系，缺乏从他们之中把问题和意见集中起来，加以研究和解决，再坚持下去的习惯，甚至对工人、农民和其他劳动者中有些什么问题，他们在想些什么，都不清楚，甚至不大注意。这不是一个工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的社会主义国家的首都的工作同志所应该有的现象。这是一种原则性的缺点、错误。
    二、有些机关政治空气稀薄，有些同志政治嗅觉不灵，对重大政治问题不能及时发觉、甚至不注意，因而，也就不能及时抓住，反映给上级解决或者自己直接加以解决。像资产阶级右派分子的猖狂进攻，人家已经活动了很久了，有些干部还糊里糊涂，若无其事，或者不知道问题的严重性，或者觉得事不关己，可以高高挂起，或者庸俗地因为怕得罪人，即右派分子，想采取超然中立的态度，但是他们却不怕得罪六万万人民。这不是我们首都的党和国家工作人员、特别是领导干部应有的政治态度，不能说这是什么进步分子的表现。
    三、工作中缺乏工人阶级认真负责的精神和坚决克服困难、彻底解决问题的朝气，不是像饿虎捕食一样寻找、发现、抓住问题，认真加以研究解决，以改进工作，推进事业，而是有时在公事上、会议上纠缠很久，问题还没有实际解决。有的人甚至习染了或者凝固地保持着旧政权、旧社会遗留下来的恶劣的官僚作风，不是把问题抓住解决，而是把问题推来推去不解决，或者让问题一个个从面前滑过去熟视无睹，甚至遇事先“打离身拳”即要推脱责任。这决不是全心全意为人民服务的表现。
    四、有不少的同志不善于从带有普遍性的问题里面抓住典型，系统地从根本上加以解决，突破一点，推动全局，而只是把问题孤零零地碰到一个解决一个。
    五、有些同志很容易认为自己的工作已经都做得很“差不多”了，很容易满足于现状。他们不是拿可能达到的最高的标准来要求自己，而是有点成就，甚至不出乱子就沾沾自喜，没有工人阶级的新兴的朝气，而是暮气沉沉。
    六、机关中的工作人员和企业单位中的管理人员都过多，机构太大。但是有些同志却认为人越多越好，机构架子越大越好，一个人作事也似乎越少越好，当首长越不亲自动手越好。
    彭真说，为了从根本上认真改进作风，使领导机关同劳动群众密切联系，并且在首都一切人民中间进一步树立劳动光荣和勤劳的风气，扫除古老封建的消费城市所遗留下来的剥削阶级和各种寄生分子游手好闲、好吃懒做的恶习，凡是能劳动和有劳动条件的人，都要从事可能的劳动。今后，除了干部参加一部分体力劳动以外，还要从现有的各机关的工作人员和各事业、企业单位的管理人员中，抽出百分之三十到百分之五十左右的工作人员，到车间、商店、农场、农业合作社、手工业合作社、街道等基层单位去，较长期地参加生产劳动和基层工作。同时动员和教育全体市民按照勤俭建国、勤俭办社、勤俭办企业、勤俭办一切事业、勤俭持家的精神，来改进我们首都的工作和干部作风，来彻底改变首都各界人民的作风成为社会主义的劳动人民的作风。我们认为应当从现有各机关工作人员和企业管理人员抽调三万人左右参加生产和基层工作，在经过相当时期，例如两三年后还可以轮流调换。
    彭真最后说，我们必须坚决地彻底地粉碎资产阶级右派的进攻，一切资产阶级右派分子应该彻底交代，坚决悔改，不要怙恶不悛，自绝于人民。会上有人开始老实交代了，这很好，是个好的开端。没有老实交代的应该好好交代，此外没有别的出路。那些同右派分子纠缠不清的人，应该同右派分子划清界限。
    彭真说，我们必须像坚决粉碎资产阶级右派的进攻一样，采用整风的方法，坚决地、认真地整顿各个方面工作人员的作风、各界人民的作风，坚决克服工作中的错误和缺点，把我们首都的各项工作做得更好，使各项事业更迅速地发展，并且把首都人民群众的风气逐步整顿成为纯洁的社会主义风气。
