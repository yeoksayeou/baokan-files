Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, 3rd - The plot of bourgeois rightist Zhang Yunbo to incite workers to leave Baotou and sabotage socialist construction has been exposed by the employees of the Baotou Sewage and Drainage Engineering Company.

Zhang Yunbo is an engineer at the Baotou Sewage and Drainage Engineering Company. He usually kept himself aloof and did not approach the workers. After the Chinese Communist Party began the rectification campaign, he suddenly became close to the masses. He went to construction sites, offices, and the catering department, and incited workers from other places supporting the construction of Baotou, saying that Baotou has ten fears: "Big sandstorms, bad climate, high prices, inconvenient transportation, poor medical care, child mortality, difficulty finding a nanny, and bad attitude of store clerks," etc. He pretended to be concerned and said to some new workers' families: "If children come to Baotou, they will die two years earlier." Among single workers, he incited them by saying: "You are so far away from your families, who doesn't have parents and a wife? The leadership is too inhumane."

Zhang Yunbo also viciously slandered the Communist Party in terms of personnel systems, labor quotas, and wage systems. He pretended to be "upholding justice and seeking redress for others," and said to some workers who were not at ease with their work: "The current personnel system is no better than labor reform; we are tied here by invisible ropes." He also went among the workers to spread rumors distorting the socialist wage system, saying, "We are getting older, and our wages will be reduced under the guise of 'to each according to his work'. From a personal perspective, there is not much hope now." "The state increases labor quotas every year, which in essence increases labor intensity and is no different from the essence of capitalism." He also used many malicious words to sow discord between the workers and the enterprise leaders, and arrogantly declared that "the company will collapse in October."

This rightist element, filled with hatred for the new society, attempted to incite workers to leave the socialist construction team and sabotage the country's plan to build a steel industry base in Baotou, which aroused the indignation of the vast number of workers. At a meeting held by the company to denounce the bourgeois rightist Zhang Yunbo, many workers and cadres revealed his reactionary words and deeds and refuted his slander against the Communist Party and socialist construction with various powerful and concrete facts.

    妄图煽动工人破坏包钢建设
    张云伯受到职工迎头痛击
    新华社包头3日电　资产阶级右派分子张云伯企图煽动职工离开包头，破坏社会主义建设的阴谋，已经被包头上下水道工程公司职工揭发出来。
    张云伯是包头上下水道工程公司工程师。他平时高高在上不接近工人，在中国共产党开始整风以后，他突然接近起群众来了。他到工地、科室和炊事房等单位，在支援包头的外地职工中间进行煽动，说包头有十怕：“风沙大、气候不好、物价高、交通不便、医疗不好、死孩子、找保姆难、商店服务员态度坏”等，他假惺惺地对一些初到包头的职工家属说：“小孩子要来包头就得早死两年”。在单身职工中间则煽动说：“你离开家庭这么远，谁无父母妻子，领导上太无人情了。”
    张云伯还从人事制度、劳动定额、工资制度等方面，向共产党进行恶毒污蔑。他装成“伸张正义，替别人伸冤诉苦”的样子，对一部分不安心工作的职工说：“现在的人事制度比劳动改造好不了多少，我们是被无形的绳子捆在这里。”他还到工人中间去散布歪曲社会主义工资制度的谣言，他说，“咱们年纪大了，以后就要在按劳取酬的帽子下下降工资，从个人利益看，现在没有多大希望。”“国家年年提高劳动定额，实质上是增强劳动强度，和资本主义的实质没有区别。”他还用许多恶毒的话，挑拨职工同企业领导的关系，并且狂妄地宣称“公司在十月份就要垮了”。
    这个对新社会充满仇恨的右派分子企图煽动职工离开社会主义建设队伍，破坏国家在包头建设钢铁工业基地的阴谋，激起了广大职工的义愤。在公司召开的声讨资产阶级右派分子张云伯的大会上，许多工人、干部，纷纷揭露了他的反动言行，并且用各种强有力的具体事实，回击了他对共产党和社会主义建设的污蔑。
