    Seedless Pomelos
    Recently, a rare pomelo tree was discovered in Jinfeng District, Changle County, Fujian Province. Every pomelo produced by this tree has no seeds in its pulp. The pomelos are large,荷绿色 (not directly translatable, think "lotus green") in color, and the pulp is red. When the peel is opened, there is a rich and fragrant aroma. The pulp has a high water content, tastes sweet, is of good quality, and is resistant to storage.
    This pomelo tree is more than sixteen chi (a Chinese unit of length, approximately 5.3 meters) tall. According to local farmers, this pomelo tree is over thirty years old and blooms and bears fruit every year.

    无核的柚子
    福建省长乐县金峰区最近发现一株珍奇的柚子树。这株树结出来的每一个柚子，果肉里都找不到一粒柚核。柚子果形硕大，呈荷绿色，柚肉呈红色。剥开柚皮时有一股浓郁的芳香气味，果肉含水量丰富，味甜质好，耐储藏。
    这株柚子树高达一丈六尺许。据当地农民谈：这株柚子树龄已达三十余年，年年开花结果。
