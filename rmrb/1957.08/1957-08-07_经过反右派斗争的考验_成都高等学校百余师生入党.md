Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 4th. More than 150 teachers, staff, students and workers from Sichuan University, Sichuan Normal College, and Chengdu Institute of Radio Engineering have recently joined the Chinese Communist Party. This is the first group of Party members absorbed by Chengdu universities and colleges after the Anti-Rightist Struggle.

During the period of helping the Party with rectification and the Anti-Rightist Struggle, these new Party members actively safeguarded the interests of the Party and socialism, and waged a resolute struggle against the Rightists. For example, Chen Mingrui, a lecturer in wired communication at Chengdu Institute of Radio Engineering and a former member of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, when the Rightists used the tactic of first praising and then suppressing him in an attempt to make him attack the Party, he not only did not waver in his trust in the Communist Party, but also constantly exposed and criticized the Rightists' conspiracy to usurp the leadership of the school. Fang Bingcheng, a student in Class Four of the first grade of the Radio Engineering Department, along with several other activists, collected materials everywhere, exposed, and defeated three Rightists in their class.

On the 3rd, Chengdu Institute of Radio Engineering held an oath-taking ceremony for forty new Party members. Mao Junye, an associate professor and deputy director of the Radio Parts Department, a new Party member and a former member of the Jiusan Society, said at the meeting that he would continue to work under the leadership of the Party to defeat the rampant attacks of the bourgeois Rightists.

    经过反右派斗争的考验
    成都高等学校百余师生入党
    新华社成都4日电　四川大学、四川师范学院和成都电讯工程学院有一百五十多个教师、职员、学生和工人，最近加入中国共产党。这是成都各高等学校经过反右派斗争后吸收的第一批党员。
    这批新党员在帮助党整风和反右派斗争中，积极维护党和社会主义的利益，和右派分子进行了坚决的斗争。例如成都电讯工程学院有线电讲师、原农工民主党党员陈明锐，当右派分子对他玩弄先捧后压的手段要他向党进攻时，他不但没有动摇对共产党的信任，并且不断揭露和抨击了右派分子企图篡夺学校领导权的阴谋活动。无线电系一年级四班学生方炳成，和另外几个积极分子一起，到处收集材料，揭发并攻垮了他们班上的三个右派分子。
    3日，成都电讯工程学院为四十个新党员举行了宣誓仪式。新党员、原九三学社成员、无线电零件系副主任毛钧业副教授在会上表示要继续在党的领导下，打垮资产阶级右派分子的猖狂进攻。
