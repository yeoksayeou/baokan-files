Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 5th – Recently, Hanyang County, Hubei Province, held a mass rally of over 3,000 people in Cai Dian town to expose and denounce a group of counter-revolutionary elements who, exploiting the aspirations of students at Hanyang No. 1 Middle School for further education, incited and organized nearly a thousand students to stage a strike and a riotous parade. During this incident, the counter-revolutionary elements blatantly put forward many reactionary slogans and calls, inciting students to smash the offices of the Hanyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the County People's Committee, and to kidnap and assault revolutionary cadres. The principal culprits who instigated this riot – Wang Jianguo, Yang Songtao, Zhong Yuwen, Hu Bin, Yu Xinping and other counter-revolutionary elements – have been arrested according to law.

Counter-Revolutionary Group Colludes with Rightist Elements
Seizing the Rectification Opportunity to Agitate Students to Make Trouble

This riot took place on June 12th and 13th. The riot was instigated by a counter-revolutionary group headed by Wang Jianguo (Communist Youth League member), the vice-principal of the school; Yang Songtao, the vice-director of teaching affairs; and Zhong Yuwen, a teacher; all of whom were hidden within the school. Yang Huanrao, a member of the China Democratic League who was wearing the cloak of a democratic party member, was the "military advisor" of this counter-revolutionary group. This counter-revolutionary group, consisting of more than ten historical counter-revolutionaries, historical special agents, and elements dissatisfied with the Party, had long been engaged in sectarian activities within the school, consistently opposing the leadership of the Hanyang County Committee of the CCP and the school's Party branch. When the nationwide Great Blooming and Contending began, they felt that the time was ripe and more actively incited "trouble" among teachers and students. Yang Huanrao, under the instruction of the Ma Zhemian right-wing group in Wuhan, also took the opportunity to infiltrate the school, using the pretext of developing "organizations" to ignite trouble everywhere, propagating the anti-Party and anti-socialist fallacies of the Zhang-Luo alliance and the Ma Zhemian reactionary group. He vehemently incited this counter-revolutionary group to seize leadership of the school's Party branch, launching a frenzied attack against the Communist Party.

Counter-Revolutionary Elements First Exploited the Dissatisfaction of Some Junior Middle School Graduates Regarding Further Education, Inciting and Organizing Students to Strike and Parade. After the strike and parade began, this group of counter-revolutionary elements posted a large number of counter-revolutionary slogans on the streets, such as "The Communist Party is on the Decline, Chairman Mao is About to Step Down," "Capture the Education Department's Dog Egg Alive," "Down with the County Committee," "County Head Han Maolin, Get Off the Stage," "Welcome the Kuomintang to Return Quickly," etc.

Smash County Party and Government Offices, Kidnap Cadres
Attempt to Kidnap the County Head and Rob the Armory

On the afternoon of June 12th, this counter-revolutionary group organized the students participating in the parade to successively storm the County People's Committee and the County Committee of the CCP, smashing the offices. The counter-revolutionary elements also directed the students to tie up Hu Ziqiao, a cadre of the County Committee. In the evening, incited by the counter-revolutionary element Yang Songtao, the students swarmed to the County Conscription Bureau, attempting to seize the Director of the Conscription Bureau. Some people stormed into the Conscription Bureau and tried to open the armory, but were prevented from succeeding by the staff of the Conscription Bureau.

In order to properly handle this incident, the responsible personnel of Hanyang County urgently instructed the principal and teachers of the school that night to persuade the students to resume classes, explaining that if they had any opinions, representatives could sit down and negotiate. However, the counter-revolutionary Wang Jianguo not only did not accept this instruction but also played a double game, perfunctorily dealing with the leadership while arranging for the counter-revolutionary group members to incite students to continue making trouble the next day. He also attempted to further incite nearby peasants to rise up and make trouble together with the students.

Counter-Revolutionaries Wanted to Incite Peasants to Make Trouble Again
Failed Under the Counterattack of Urban and Rural Masses

The next day, this group of counter-revolutionary elements incited and organized more students to go to the County People's Committee to put forward various demands. County Head Han Maolin met with the student representatives and met with all the students, earnestly and responsibly answering the demands they raised. He also explained in detail some of the unreasonable demands or issues that the county had no authority to resolve. At that time, most of the students stabilized, but this group of counter-revolutionary elements then used the excuse that they were dissatisfied with some of the answers and incited the students to make a big scene again. Someone took out ropes from their waists to tie up the county head, but as a result, they tied up three cadres who stood up to protect the county head. The students also surrounded the County Committee of the CCP, finally breaking into the building and beating many cadres.

The workers and peasants in Cai Dian Town and nearby expressed unparalleled indignation at this riot incited by the counter-revolutionary elements, and they gave these counter-revolutionary elements a powerful counterattack at the time. The counter-revolutionary elements Wang Jianguo and Zhong Yuwen incited and instructed students to go to the countryside to incite peasants to rise up and make trouble, but they were severely rebuked and rejected by peasants in several townships. The peasants rebuked these students for being "ungrateful" to the Party and the government and for "making trouble without reason." Some peasant parents rebuked their children, saying, "We raised you up to study peacefully, but you are causing trouble!" When students, incited by counter-revolutionary elements, took to the streets to parade and commit violence, more than 600 workers from factories, construction sites, and transportation companies in Cai Dian Town immediately stopped production voluntarily. They rushed to the place where students gathered to make trouble to reason with the students, protest the students' illegal actions, and automatically protect the safety of important organs without even having time to wash off the oil stains on their bodies. Peasants from nearby villages also rushed to the school to condemn the students, saying, "Where did your food and clothing come from? You shouldn't forget your roots!" Yi Guoqing, a worker from an oil mill, followed County Head Han Maolin to protect him, saying, "This is the county head we elected, who else should we protect if not him!" When he followed Han Maolin to the school, he heard someone shout to tie up the county head. He spotted the person at a glance and chased him from the schoolyard to a small room upstairs, finally catching the person, who turned out to be the counter-revolutionary element Yang Songtao. Later, Yi Guoqing released Yang Songtao after being persuaded by County Head Han Maolin. On the 14th, under the incitement of counter-revolutionary elements, the students planned to take to the streets again, but they did not dare to act rashly because there were protesting workers and peasants everywhere on the streets.

Many Deceived People Awakened
Joined the Struggle Together with the Masses

After the incident occurred, workers, peasants, and people from all walks of life in the entire county and neighboring counties protested and condemned the students' illegal actions. The school gate and the streets were covered with protest letters and slogans demanding that the government severely punish the counter-revolutionary elements who instigated the riot.

Since the riot was quelled, the Xiaogan Prefectural Committee of the CCP, the Hanyang County Committee, and the government's public security departments immediately organized investigation teams. After nearly two months of repeated investigation and research, they thoroughly mobilized the masses, educated the students, and cooperated with the investigation work of the public security departments, finally revealing the truth. Especially at the recent denunciation meeting, many teachers and students who had been deceived or used by counter-revolutionary elements unanimously stood up to angrily expose and report the criminal conspiracies of the counter-revolutionary group of Wang Jianguo, Yang Songtao, etc. Some students also deeply reviewed their mistakes. Some teachers who participated in this counter-revolutionary group also expressed repentance and joined the masses in the struggle against the main culprits. The main members of the counter-revolutionary group who have been arrested, Wang Jianguo, Yang Songtao, Zhong Yuwen, Hu Bin, Yu Xinping, etc., had to bow their heads and admit their guilt due to the existence of both human and material evidence. Teng Wenjun, a student who took the lead in making trouble and proclaimed himself secretary-general of the strike committee, has been expelled from school and arrested according to law for his stubbornness.

    在广大工农群众坚决反击下
    汉阳扑灭反革命煽动的暴乱
    主犯已经依法逮捕　受骗师生痛悔前非
    新华社武汉5日电　湖北省汉阳县最近在蔡甸镇举行了三千多人的群众大会，揭发和控诉一伙反革命分子利用汉阳第一中学学生的升学要求，煽动和组织近千名学生举行罢课和游行的暴乱事件。反革命分子在这一次事件中明目张胆地提出了许多反动的标语和口号，煽动学生捣毁中共汉阳县委和县人民委员会机关，并且绑架和殴打革命干部。制造这次暴乱事件的主犯王建国、杨松涛、钟毓文、胡斌、余心平等反革命分子已被依法逮捕。
    反革命集团勾结右派分子
    乘整风机会鼓动学生闹事
    这一暴乱事件发生在6月12、13两日。制造这次暴乱事件的是以这个学校的副校长王建国（共青团员）、教导副主任杨松涛、教员钟毓文等为首一伙暗藏在校内的反革命集团；披着民主党派的外衣的民盟盟员杨焕尧是这个反革命集团的“军师”。这个由十多名历史反革命分子、历史特务分子和对党不满分子组成的反革命集团，长久以来就在学校内部搞宗派活动，一贯地反对中共汉阳县委和学校党支部的领导；当全国展开大鸣大放以后，他们认为时机已经成熟，更加积极地在教员和学生中鼓动“闹事”。杨焕尧在武汉马哲民右派集团的指示下，也乘机混进学校，借发展“组织”为名到处点火，宣扬章、罗联盟和马哲民反动集团的反党反社会主义谬论，极力鼓动这个反革命集团向学校党支部争夺领导权，向共产党发起了猖狂的进攻。
    反革命分子首先利用今年某些初中毕业生因为升学问题产生的不满情绪，煽动并组织学生进行罢课和游行。罢课和游行开始后，这一伙反革命分子就在大街上张贴了大批反革命标语。例如“共产党走下坡路了，毛主席要下台了”、“活捉教育厅狗蛋”、“打倒县委会”、“县长韩茂林滚下台”、“欢迎国民党赶快回来”等。
    捣毁县党政机关捆走干部
    企图绑架县长抢劫军火库
    6月12日下午，这个反革命集团组织参加游行的学生，先后冲进了县人民委员会和中共县委会，捣毁机关办公室。反革命分子还指挥学生捆走了县委会的干部胡子乔。晚上，在反革命分子杨松涛的挑拨下，学生又拥到县兵役局，企图捉拿兵役局长；有些人冲进兵役局后曾想打开军火库，只因被兵役局工作人员制止而未得逞。
    汉阳县的负责人员为了正确处理这一事件，当夜曾紧急指示这个学校的校长和教员劝说学生复课，说明如有意见可以让代表坐下谈判。但反革命分子王建国不但不接受这一指示，反而玩弄两面手法，一面对领导上敷衍，一面布置这个反革命集团分子煽动学生第二天继续闹事。并企图进一步挑动附近农民起来和学生一起闹。
    反革命又想煽动农民闹事
    在城乡群众反击下失败了
    第二天，这伙反革命分子煽动和组织了更多的学生赶到县人民委员会提出了各种要求。县长韩茂林接见了学生代表并同全体学生见了面，认真负责地答复了他们提出的要求，对其中某些不合理的要求或者县里无权解决的问题，也详细地作了解释。当时大部分学生稳定下来了，这伙反革命分子这时竟借口对有的答复不满意而又煽动学生大闹起来。有人从腰里掏出绳子要捆绑县长，结果把挺身而出保护县长的三个干部捆走了。学生们还包围了中共县委会，最后破门而入殴打了很多机关干部。
    蔡甸镇和附近的工人、农民群众对反革命分子策动的这一暴乱表示了无比的愤慨，他们当时就给了这些反革命分子以有力的回击。反革命分子王建国、钟毓文鼓动、指示学生下乡煽动农民起来闹事，但连跑几个乡都受到农民的严厉斥责和拒绝。农民斥责这些学生对党和政府是“恩将仇报”，“无理取闹”，有些农民家长斥责自己的子弟说：“把你们养大了不安分念书，竟搞坏事！”当学生在反革命分子的煽动下上街游行并行凶打人时，蔡甸镇上的工厂和建筑、搬运工人共六百多人马上自动停止生产，连身上的油污还没来得及洗就到学生集合闹事的地方来和学生说理，抗议学生的非法行动，并且自动保卫住重要机关的安全。附近乡的农民也赶到学校来谴责学生说：“你们吃的穿的那里来的？不应忘了本！”榨油厂工人易国卿一直跟随在县长韩茂林身边保卫县长，他说：“这是我们选出来的县长，我们不保护谁保护！”他跟着韩茂林到学校去时，听见有人叫喊要捆县长，他一眼看准了就追这个人，一直从校院追到楼上一间小屋里终于捉住了这个人，原来正是反革命分子杨松涛。后来在县长韩茂林的劝说下易国卿才把杨松涛放了。14日学生们在反革命分子的煽动下又酝酿上街，但是大街上到处有出来抗议的工人和农民群众，才不敢轻举妄动。
    许多受骗的人觉悟过来
    同群众一起参加了斗争
    事件发生后，全县和邻县的工人、农民及各界人士纷纷抗议、谴责学生们的不法行为，学校门外和大街上贴满了抗议书和标语，要求政府严厉惩办策动这一次暴乱的反革命分子。
    自暴乱事件平息后，中共孝感地委、汉阳县委和政府公安部门立即组织了考察团，经过将近两个月的反复调查研究，深入发动群众、教育学生和配合以公安部门的侦察工作，终于真相大白。特别在最近举行的控诉大会上，许多受骗或被反革命分子利用的教员和学生，一致起来愤怒地揭发和检举了王建国、杨松涛等反革命集团的罪恶阴谋，有些学生并沉痛地检讨了自己的错误。参加这个反革命集团的部分教员也表示悔悟，和群众一起参加了对主要凶犯的斗争。已被逮捕的反革命集团主要成员王建国、杨松涛、钟毓文、胡斌、余心平等，由于人证、物证俱在，不得不低头伏罪。在学生中带头闹事并自封为罢课委员会秘书长的学生滕文俊由于顽固不悟，已被开除学籍并依法逮捕。
