The two sides exchanged views in a cordial and sincere atmosphere and had a completely consistent view on the current international situation.

The communiqué stated that both sides pointed out that the signing of a disarmament agreement by all countries would certainly promote the relaxation of international tensions and the consolidation of peace, and would also promote the reunification of Germany and Vietnam on the basis of peace and democracy. Both sides emphasized that they support the Soviet Union's proposal, made during the discussion of disarmament issues in London, to immediately cease atomic and hydrogen weapon tests, and support the demand for an unconditional ban on the production and use of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction. Both sides unanimously condemned West Germany's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and South Vietnam's preparation to join the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. Both sides emphasized that West Germany's remilitarization and preparation for atomic warfare, as well as South Vietnam's militarization, threaten the cause of peace and are serious obstacles to the unification of Germany and Vietnam. The communiqué pointed out that both sides fully support the efforts made by the two countries to peacefully unify their own countries.

The communiqué finally emphasized that both sides are determined to continue to strengthen and expand the friendly relations between the two countries.
