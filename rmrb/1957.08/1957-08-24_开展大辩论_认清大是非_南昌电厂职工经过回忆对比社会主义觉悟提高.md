Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 22nd: The Nanchang Power Plant recently conducted a mass debate, providing all employees with a profound socialist ideological education.

During the First Five-Year Plan period, the plant underwent a large-scale expansion, with new workers and apprentices accounting for over 50% of the total workforce. Most of these new workers came from non-working-class backgrounds, and their political awareness was not high enough. When bourgeois right-wing elements launched a frenzied attack against the Party, some of them were also influenced by this evil wind, causing some confusion in their thinking. Some developed individualism, economism, egalitarianism, and extreme democracy. Some clamored for higher living standards and treatment, indulged in pleasure-seeking, and shirked work; in their work, they feared hardship and difficulty, were absent from work without reason, were late or left early, and disobeyed assignments.

In response to the above situation, the plant's CCP Party Committee conducted research and focused on educating them from a positive perspective. Responsible comrades from each general branch and directly affiliated branch made reports to the workers, and then held group discussions, using recollection and comparison to inspire workers to conduct self-education.

In this great debate, veteran workers used their own experiences to educate young workers on the superiority of the socialist system. Zhao Deyao, a worker in the line work area, said: "Before liberation, you could be fired any day. Now our jobs are guaranteed, and we eat and dress well. Without the leadership of the Communist Party, how could we have this today!" Xiong Yangfei, a maintenance worker, said: "In the past, our country couldn't manufacture airplanes or cars, but now we can. In the past, only the sons and daughters of landlords and the bourgeoisie could go to school, but now many are children of workers and peasants. Aren't these all achievements made under the leadership of the Communist Party? Without the Party's leadership, how could there be socialism?"

Through this great debate, workers gained a more correct understanding of the relationship between democracy and centralism, freedom and discipline. Zeng Gaoxi, a lineman, said: "If there is only democracy and no centralism, how can we lead production and construction? If there is no discipline, and everyone is late or leaves early, how can we do a good job in production?" Hu Runsheng said: "Some people think that only democracy without centralism, only freedom without discipline, is called 'democracy' and 'freedom.' In fact, this is harming the interests of the working class and the socialist cause." Some young workers who had not performed well in the past, after being educated in this great debate, automatically made self-criticisms and expressed that they would correct themselves in the future.

After the workers' ideological awareness improved, the phenomena of a few workers being absent from work without reason, dancing during work hours, and arguing over wages and welfare have disappeared. Everyone is concentrating on doing a good job in production and using practical actions to counterattack the right-wing. In July, except for the coal consumption index, which was not completed, other indicators such as total output value and labor productivity exceeded the planned targets. Workers who were slack in the past, disobeyed assignments and commands, have now become production activists. Guan Xiangshou, a lineman, used to be unwilling to be transferred to the youth shock brigade because he was afraid of being tired. After receiving socialist ideological education this time, he not only obeyed the organization's assignment, but also performed very well at work and was praised by the work area.

### 开展大辩论　认清大是非　南昌电厂职工经过回忆对比社会主义觉悟提高

　　开展大辩论　认清大是非
　　南昌电厂职工经过回忆对比社会主义觉悟提高
    据新华社南昌22日电　南昌电厂最近通过群众性的大辩论，使全体职工受到了一次深刻的社会主义思想教育。
    这个厂在第一个五年计划期中由于进行了大规模的扩建，新工人和学徒工约占全厂职工人数的50％以上。这批新工人多数出身于非工人阶级，政治觉悟还不够高，当资产阶级右派分子向党猖狂进攻的时候，他们中间有些人也受了这股歪风的影响，在思想上引起了一些混乱。有些人滋长了个人主义、经济主义、平均主义和极端民主等思想。有的人在生活上闹升级、闹待遇，贪图享受，好逸恶劳；在工作上，怕艰苦、怕困难，无故旷工、迟到早退、不服从调配等。
    针对上述情况，厂的中共党委会作了研究，着重从正面向他们进行了教育，各总支、直属支部的负责同志都分别向职工作了报告，会后又分组讨论，用回忆对比的方式，启发职工进行自我教育。
    在这次大辩论中，老工人们用自身的经历，向青年工人进行了社会主义制度优越性的教育。线路工区工人赵德耀说：“在解放前，今天做工，明天说不定就要被解雇。现在我们的工作有保障，吃得好，穿得好。没有共产党领导我们那能有今天！”检修工熊仰飞说：“过去我国自己不会制造飞机、汽车，现在会了。过去进学校的都是地主阶级和资产阶级的少爷、小姐，现在有很多是工农子弟。这不都是在共产党领导下所取得的成就吗？没有党的领导，怎么能有社会主义呢？”
    通过这次大辩论，职工们对民主与集中、自由与纪律的关系有了比较正确的认识。外线工人曾高喜说：“如果只有民主，没有集中，那怎么来领导生产、领导建设呢？如果没有纪律，上班时大家都是迟到早退，那怎么能搞好生产呢？”胡润生说：“有人认为只要民主不要集中，只要自由不要纪律，这才叫‘民主’、‘自由’。其实这是损害工人阶级的利益、损害社会主义事业的民主和自由。”一些过去表现不太好的年轻工人，经过这次大辩论教育以后，自动作了检讨，表示今后要改正过来。
    职工思想觉悟提高后，过去少数工人无故旷工、上班时跳舞、为工资、福利问题大吵大闹等现象已经看不到了。大家都集中精力搞好生产，以实际行动来回击右派。7月份除煤耗指标没有完成以外，其他如总产值、劳动生产率等几个指标都已超额完成计划。过去工作懈怠、不服从调配和指挥的工人，现在也成了生产积极分子。线路工人官祥寿过去组织上要把他调到青年突击队去，他因怕累不愿意，这次受到社会主义思想教育后，不仅服从了组织分配，而且工作上表现得很好，受到了工区的表扬。
