Xinhua News Agency, Washington, August 27th: The White House and the U.S. Department of Defense maintained silence on August 26th regarding the Soviet Union's successful testing of an intercontinental ballistic missile. Some members of Congress expressed alarm.

　　Senator Jackson, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a Democratic senator, said that this matter "cannot be ignored" and that it shows that the United States has fallen behind the Soviet Union, at least in the race to produce intermediate-range missiles.

　　Senator Gore, a member of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy of both houses of Congress, said that the Soviet Union's successful testing of an intercontinental missile "underscores the urgent need to find a way to reach an arms reduction agreement, especially on nuclear weapons."

　　Former Secretary of the Air Force, Senator Symington, also said that when the Soviet Union says they have made some achievements regarding such weapons, "it later turns out to be true." He advocated that the United States should currently step up the development of intercontinental missiles.

　　Since the United States' "Atlas" missile exploded and failed in flight shortly after launch in June of this year, there has been no news of the United States successfully testing an intercontinental ballistic missile.

　　美官方沉默
    据新华社27日讯　华盛顿消息：白宫和美国国防部8月26日对苏联试验成功洲际弹道火箭的消息保持缄默，一些国会议员表示感到惊恐。
    参议院军事委员会委员、民主党参议员杰克逊说，这件事是“不容忽视”的，它表明美国至少在制造中程导弹的竞赛方面已经落在苏联后面。
    参众两院原子能联席委员会委员、参议员戈尔说，苏联试验成功洲际导弹“着重表明，目前非常迫切需要设法达成裁军协议，特别是关于核武器的裁军协议。”
    前空军部长、参议员薛明顿也说，当苏联说关于这类武器他们有了一些成就的时候，“后来发现果然是事实”。他主张美国目前应该加紧发展洲际导弹。
    自从美国的“阿特拉斯”导弹今年6月在发射后不久在飞行中爆炸而失败后，迄今没有过消息说美国已经试验洲际弹道导弹成功。
