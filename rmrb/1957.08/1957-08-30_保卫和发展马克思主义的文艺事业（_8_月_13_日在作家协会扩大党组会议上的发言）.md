　　Defend and Develop the Marxist Literary and Art Cause
　 (Speech at the Expanded Party Group Meeting of the Writers Association on August 13)
    Qian Junrui
    The struggle against the Ding Ling and Chen Qixia anti-Party clique is a struggle of decisive significance on the current literary and art front in our country. In essence, this struggle is one between the socialist road and the capitalist road in literary and art work, and between the proletarian literary and art line and the bourgeois literary and art line. This struggle has a long history, and it has been particularly intense recently, especially in the past year. From the perspective of the current nationwide class struggle, it has clearly become a part of the bourgeoisie's right-wing's rampant attack on the Party and socialism, and the Party's and the people's resolute counterattack against the bourgeois right-wing. It is a life-and-death struggle on the literary and art front.
    This struggle is particularly important on the literary and art front, not only because the figures of the Ding and Chen anti-Party clique have a certain influence at home and abroad, but especially because this struggle has universal typical significance. It involves several fundamental issues of the revolutionary literary and art movement, such as: Is the literary and art cause the cause of the Party and the people, or is it a personal cause? Does the principle of Party spirit in literature exist? Should the literary and art cause have the leadership of the Party? Is the orientation of literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers correct? And so on. The members of this anti-Party clique are distributed in all aspects of the literary and art front. It maintains direct or indirect contact with other anti-Party cliques within the Party (such as the Jiang Feng anti-Party clique in the art world) and certain right-wing cliques outside the Party.
    The literary and art line of the Ding and Chen anti-Party clique is a bourgeois literary and art line. It is basically consistent with the literary and art line of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. They oppose regarding the literary cause as the cause of the Party and the people, but only regard it as a personal cause; they deny the principle of Party spirit in literature; they deny the guiding role of world outlook on literary creation. They deny the basic policy of literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and despise popularization work. They despise national heritage and national forms. They neglect politics and deny the Party's leadership over the literary and art cause. They vigorously promote individualism (such as Ding Ling promoting "one-bookism," "only what you write is your own," advocating pride, etc.), using various forms of bourgeois ideology to corrupt young people and the masses.
    Armed with such a bourgeois literary and art line, the Ding and Chen anti-Party clique has for a long time wantonly attacked the Party's literary and art policy and the Party's leadership. This attack sometimes takes a concealed form and sometimes takes a public form. More than two years ago, they completely usurped the leadership of "Wenyi Bao" and issued orders to the whole country based on their bourgeois world outlook and bourgeois literary and art policy. Because the Party had criticized them in 1955, they had temporarily restrained themselves for a period of time, but still did not stop their hidden attacks. Last year, the socialist revolution on the economic front was basically completed, and the private ownership of the means of production was basically completed for socialist transformation. The members of the Ding and Chen clique, like all bourgeois right-wing intellectuals, as a small handful of "hairs" who have lost their old skin but are determined not to attach new skin, have become even more intolerable to socialism (including Party leadership, collectivism, planning, centralization, discipline, etc.). The "private property" in their minds (the so-called "one-bookism" is a typical manifestation of this spiritual private property system) has risen more stubbornly to resist. Coupled with certain international events last year, especially the Hungarian incident, which made them even more dizzy. So Chen Qixia estimated: "The situation after the Hungarian incident is favorable to us"; Feng Xuefeng believed that "humanity has no hope," "the flood is about to break through our door," and called on people to "avenge grievances and revenge"; Chen Yong, a rather brave knight of this anti-Party clique, even shouted that "the eve of great change has arrived"! Jiang Feng, who had close ties with this clique and served as the head of another anti-Party clique in the art world, greatly praised and incited great democracy, believing that "my opportunity to speak has arrived," believing that the gap between urban and rural life is now huge, "once the peasants are called upon, tens of thousands of people will rise up to resist." Under such a completely erroneous estimate of the domestic and international situation, the Ding and Chen anti-Party clique reorganized its troops, closely cooperated with the bourgeois right-wing in society, and launched an open and fierce attack on the Party and socialism. These anti-Party elements fully understand that the fortress is most easily broken from within. Therefore, just as the Zhang-Luo alliance was frantically infiltrating our revolutionary literary and art front, and just as right-wing elements such as Wu Zuguang, Xiao Qian, Zhang Yousong, Wang Ruowang, and Liu Shahe were rampantly attacking the Party and socialism, the Ding and Chen anti-Party clique and the Jiang Feng anti-Party clique did not hesitate to raise the white flag and implement the tactic of attacking the leadership core from within the Party organization.
    What is the anti-Party slogan of this clique? Like all bourgeois right-wing elements, they insidiously use the slogan of the Party's rectification campaign. They use the guise of opposing dogmatism to oppose literature and art accepting the guidance of the communist world outlook, opposing literature and art serving politics, and opposing literature and art implementing the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. They use the guise of opposing sectarianism to oppose literature and art as the cause of the Party and the masses, opposing the Party's leadership over literature and art, and opposing the Party's leading core in literary and art work. They maliciously distort the Party's leadership policy and uglify the Party's leaders. They portray the Party's leadership institutions and leaders as short-sighted and factional cliques that specialize in infighting, in order to provoke the relationship between the Party and the masses, isolate the Party, and attack the Party, in an attempt to put themselves in higher leadership positions in order to realize their bourgeois reactionary literary and art program.
    Looking at the overall development history of the Ding and Chen anti-Party clique, there is a central issue that deserves special mention, that is, the relationship between the individual and the Party, and the relationship between the individual and the collective of the people. Feng Xuefeng himself confessed that he had joined the Party for thirty years, but for thirty years his relationship with the Party had never been properly handled. Without exception, these anti-Party elements are all bourgeois intellectuals who joined the Party organizationally but not ideologically, and who have basically not been transformed. They are all extreme individualists. Ding Ling herself said: "I am a stubborn individualistic ambitious person, and all my ideas and measures are for myself." Feng Xuefeng said that his "deep-rooted individualism" is "egocentrism." Chen Qixia described his despicable individualism as having "developed into a crazy vindictiveness." The fact is indeed the case. These people have all developed from extremely serious bourgeois individualism (some also mixed with the oppressive thoughts of barbaric feudal landlords) to falling into the quagmire of anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialism.
    Take Ding Ling as an example. Ding Ling was born into a feudal landlord family. Her father was so wealthy that when he saw someone riding a horse with a good posture, he sent someone to buy back many white horses at a high price, each equipped with a white satin embroidered saddle, and then asked people to ride in front of him for amusement. Her mother specially built a swing in her garden for her to relax. Later, her family declined. It was in such a family, coupled with the influence of decadent hedonistic literature, that Ding Ling's mind was deeply imprinted with the selfishness, pride, and despair of this declining class. Ding Ling once analyzed her thoughts at that time as "a kind of middle peasant consciousness" (see Ding: "My Creative Life"), which is not true. Later, she came into contact with the new tide of bourgeois democracy and quickly conceived nihilistic ideas. In 1922, she joined the anarchist party. She was enthusiastic about the bourgeois view of women's equality. In 1928, she began to write novels. The ideological essence of the protagonist in her early work "The Diary of Miss Sophia" reflects the author's thoughts at that time. Miss Sophia is an egocentric person. She plays with the male Ling Jishi. She is proud of her "fooling" others, "lying" and "dishonesty." She will eventually "let that tall boy taste my unyielding, unreasonable arrogance and insult." Finally, she said, "Fortunately, in this universe, my life is just my own plaything, and I have wasted enough." "Quietly live, quietly die, ah! I pity you, Sophia!" Ding Ling's thoughts have basically not changed for more than 20 years, and have even developed in some aspects. In 1930, she joined the Left League work, and in 1932, she joined the Party. In May 1933, she was arrested, and soon she succumbed to the enemy and betrayed her. In 1936, she transferred to Yan'an. Not only did she not realize that she had made a very serious political mistake and exercised and transformed herself properly, but she also regarded herself as a famous writer and was dissatisfied with the Party and the People's Government. The Party pointed out her mistakes at that time and gave her an important job position. But she maintained a strong resentment. So under her presidency, the counter-revolutionary Wang Shiwei's "Wild Lily" was published, and she herself personally wrote "Thoughts on March 8th" and "In the Hospital," slandering the liberated areas led by the Party. These articles clearly revealed the anti-Party nature of her thoughts. The "Wild Lily" that she agreed with viciously slandered the masses' "feeling that they are aliens" towards the leaders at that time. In her "Thoughts on March 8th," Ding Ling described the liberated areas as gloomy and dark, saying that women were in a "tragic fate," and this situation "in the old society, they might be called pitiful, unfortunate, but today, they are all self-inflicted and deserve it." Ding Ling's distortion and attack on the new society is no different from the slander of the bourgeois right-wing today who obliterates everything and says "the present is not as good as the past." No wonder the Kuomintang reactionaries obtained Ding Ling's article and regarded it as a treasure, just as the US State Department and the Chiang Kai-shek clique today praise Zhang Bojun, Chu Anping, and Ge Peiqi. After liberation, Ding Ling's bourgeois individualistic thoughts were further developed. She was more enthusiastic about competing for fame, status, and enjoyment, and even developed to the point of attempting to seize the leadership of the entire literary and art front.
    Other main members of the anti-Party clique headed by Ding Ling are also extreme individualists, and at the same time, there are thick factors of hostile thoughts of class alien elements in their minds. It is this group of people who talk about individualism first, flatter each other, pull and pull, talk about "conscience," "humanity," "friendship," and "warmth," and usually do petty favors and do not speak of justice; they are good at small broadcasts, spreading rumors and slanders, and gathering some elements who are dissatisfied with the Party and the government to form a formal or informal group. It is this group of people who are arrogant and self-righteous, regard the cause entrusted to them by the Party as their own independent kingdom, and the Party cannot criticize or interfere with their affairs. It is this group of people who, when they are criticized by the Party and their superiors, say that "so-and-so's sect is attacking them and framing them," and pretend to be pitiful, as if they have been "wronged," to win over the masses, seize the initiative and a favorable position, and wait for an opportunity to attack the Party.
    For these people, the Party is only an "abstract" existence, or more correctly, the Party is only a signboard, a tool for them to hunt for fame and gain. They always regard the Party organizations and leaders who specifically lead their work as wrong, simply as extremely sinful eyesores and obstacles that should be hated and opposed. They always put the individual first and their own small group second; the Party has no place in their eyes. The "the Party is there with them" said by Ding Ling and others truly reflects their psychological state. They believe that their achievements are the result of personal efforts, denying the decisive role of the Party's leadership and the masses' support for their certain achievements. They believe that they have contributed to the Party and have rendered meritorious service to the Party, they have given glory to the Party and invested in the Party, and the Party owes them a debt. The greater their achievements and reputation, the lighter the Party's weight, and the farther they are from the Party. They believe that the Party is dispensable. When they feel that the Party is beneficial to them, they seem to be close to the Party and play with the Party for a while; when they feel that the existence of the Party is detrimental to them, they can kick the Party away without hesitation. They play double-dealing tricks with the Party, one set in person and another set behind their backs. When they frantically attack the Party, they can even take the form of illegal underground conspiracy activities. The anti-Party crimes of the Ding Ling group and the Jiang Feng group have in fact developed to such a despicable and vicious degree. At the same time, they have also formed a united front with the bourgeois right-wing in society to attack the Party and socialism.
    As an urgent and extremely important task in the literary and art circles today, it is necessary to thoroughly expose and smash the criminal activities of the anti-Party clique. We must affirm that the Party's literary and art policy and the proletarian literary and art line have already achieved great victories in our country. In the long years before liberation, wasn't there the brilliant record of the left-wing literary and art movement led by our Party with Lu Xun as the main general? Wasn't there the great achievement of revolutionary literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers in our liberated areas? In the new China after liberation, hasn't great progress been made in all departments of literature and art? However, in our country, Marxism and literature and art have not yet truly and comprehensively combined correctly. The leadership of the proletariat, the leadership of our Party, has not yet been truly established in many literary and art work departments and for many literary and art workers. This is the most fundamental problem on the current literary and art front in our country. In the next ten to fifteen years, our country will vigorously develop industry and agriculture, establish the foundation of modern industry and modern agriculture, and establish a relatively sufficient material basis for socialist society. In order to achieve this goal, the ideological departments (including literature and art) of the superstructure should give full play to the role of the superstructure, strengthen the Party's Marxist-Leninist leadership, strengthen socialist education for the masses, and at the same time vigorously train the working class's own intellectual circles. In the face of such a great task, the basic task of our literary and art front is to establish the Party's leadership as quickly as possible, correctly and resolutely implement the Party's literary and art line, and at the same time vigorously train writers, artists, and literary and art theorists of the working class who are loyal to the socialist cause. The current struggle against the Ding and Chen anti-Party clique is one of the extremely necessary steps to achieve this basic task.
    When carrying out the struggle against the Ding and Chen anti-Party clique, we must also draw some important and painful lessons.
    First of all, we must be especially vigilant against the development of bourgeois individualistic ideas in the literary and art circles. After the nationwide victory, this individualistic tendency of pursuing personal fame, status, and enjoyment in the literary and art circles has developed to a very terrible degree in many departments and among many people. The creative activities of these people are first for money, for fame, and for rank and treatment. There was a director in Changchun Film Studio named Sha Meng. He directed a "Shangganling," and the factory gave him a reward of 1,400 yuan, and he made a lot of noise; he was given 1,600 yuan, but he was still dissatisfied. Another director, named Lu Ban, shamelessly called on the factory to "strive for the RMB!" Some playwrights and composers recorded traditional scripts and scores from veteran artists. This was originally a good thing, but they regarded them as their own creations, or only wrote their own names, not the names of the veteran artists, only to fight for royalties for themselves, not to let the veteran artists get royalties, or only to distribute very little royalties to them. This kind of corrupt bourgeois individualistic thinking has eroded some of our writers and artists so deeply that their desire to create has been suffocated, and their works have lost any power to inspire people to move forward. Many of them are no longer worthy of the title of human soul engineers, and they have degenerated into the corrosive of people's minds and the borers of human souls!
    It should be especially emphasized that the contradiction between bourgeois individualistic thinking and the current revolutionary requirements has never been so acute as it is today. This is because our revolution has entered the stage of socialist revolution from the stage of bourgeois democratic revolution. Now bourgeois ideology and socialism are in direct confrontation. Either the proletarian ideological system triumphs over the bourgeois ideological system, or the bourgeois ideological system triumphs over the proletarian ideological system. This is a life-and-death struggle on the ideological front, and there is no middle road. Bourgeois ideology is a direct hostile ideology to socialism, and we must completely defeat it in order to successfully carry out socialist construction.
    Precisely because bourgeois ideology occupies such a position in today's class struggle, people with very serious bourgeois individualism often inevitably degenerate into incurable anti-Party elements and bourgeois right-wing elements; at the same time, many people with fairly serious bourgeois individualism and liberalism are often easy to fall into the clutches of right-wing elements and anti-Party elements, and become their tools and "masses" for opposing the Party and socialism. Didn't Ding Ling and Jiang Feng and others claim that they "have the masses"? This is enough to arouse people's serious vigilance.
    From this, it can be seen that special attention must be paid to overcoming bourgeois individualism in the literary and art circles. The more widespread and serious bourgeois individualistic thinking in the literary and art circles today is not accidental. This is because most of the current literary and art circles come from landlords, the bourgeoisie, or the upper petty bourgeoisie, and have received more bourgeois education in old China; at the same time, because we mostly engage in individual mental labor, it is particularly easy to get out of touch with the masses and out of touch with reality. Therefore, for every literary and art worker from the old society, bourgeois individualistic thinking is not so easy to overcome. This requires our special vigilance and greater efforts.
    Finally, we can no longer take a liberal attitude towards wrong tendencies and wrong ideological styles. We must adhere to the correct stand and principles, and we must conduct serious criticism and struggle against various wrong thoughts in a timely manner. Liberalism and sentimentalism can only condone and encourage mistakes, and are poisonous weeds that corrode people. In the past two years, we have criticized the mistakes of the Ding and Chen group and the mistakes of the Jiang Feng group. However, these criticisms were not thorough enough, and coupled with the fact that the anti-Party thoughts of these groups have deep roots and great strength (of course, this is the main reason), they have developed to such a serious degree today. A prevailing trend in our literary and art circles is that, in order to "take care of" the characteristics of literary and art work and the characteristics of literary and art workers, unprincipled concessions and compromises are often made to wrong tendencies and wrong ideological styles. It is said that this is to unite and win over the majority. But experience tells us that doing so will not only fail to achieve the purpose of uniting and winning over the majority, but will only block people's minds, reduce the Party's prestige, and damage principled unity. In view of the past lessons, we must carry out the struggle against right-wing elements and anti-Party elements to the end and achieve a complete victory, and we must not give up halfway. We can no longer engage in liberalism and sentimentalism for general mistakes. In this way, we can defend the Marxist literary and art cause and make it continue to develop.

　　保卫和发展马克思主义的文艺事业
　 （8月13日在作家协会扩大党组会议上的发言）
    钱俊瑞
    反对丁玲、陈企霞反党集团的斗争，在我国当前文艺战线上是一个有决定意义的斗争。这个斗争按它的实质说来，就是文艺工作中社会主义道路与资本主义道路的斗争，就是无产阶级的文艺路线与资产阶级文艺路线的斗争。这个斗争已有一段漫长的历史，而在最近时期，特别是近一年来表现得特别激烈。从目前全国范围阶级斗争的角度来看，它已明显地构成资产阶级右派向党和社会主义的猖狂进攻，以及党和全国劳动人民向资产阶级右派坚决反击的一个部分。它是文艺战线上一个你死我活的斗争。
    这一斗争在文艺战线上之所以特别重要，不仅仅因为丁、陈反党集团的人物在国内外有一定的影响，尤其是因为这一斗争有着普遍的典型意义。它涉及革命文艺运动的若干根本性的问题，例如：文艺事业究竟是党和人民的事业，还是个人的事业？文学的党性原则究竟存在不存在？文艺事业究竟要不要党的领导？文艺的工农兵方向究竟对不对？等等。这个反党集团的成员分布在文艺阵线的各个方面。它同党内的其它反党小集团（例如美术界的江丰反党小集团）和某些党外右派集团保持着直接的或者间接的联系。
    丁、陈反党集团的文艺路线是资产阶级的文艺路线。它基本上是和胡风反革命集团的文艺路线相一致的。他们反对把文学事业看成党和人民的事业，而把它只看作个人的事业；他们否认文学的党性原则；否认世界观对文学创作的指导作用。他们否认文艺为工农兵服务的基本方针，轻视普及工作。他们轻视民族遗产和民族形式。他们忽视政治，否认党对文艺事业的领导。他们大肆宣传个人主义（如丁玲宣传“一本书主义”，“只有你写的东西才是你自己的”，提倡骄傲等），用形形色色的资产阶级思想腐蚀青年和人民群众。
    用这样一条资产阶级文艺路线武装起来的丁、陈反党集团，长时期来向党的文艺方针和党的领导实行恣意的攻击。这种攻击，有时采用隐蔽的方式，有时采取公开的方式。两年多前他们曾经完全篡夺了“文艺报”的领导，根据他们资产阶级的世界观和资产阶级的文艺方针，向全国发号施令。由于在1955年党曾经对他们作了批评，他们在一个时期内曾稍稍歛迹，但是仍然没有停止他们隐蔽的攻击。去年经济战线上社会主义革命基本上完成，生产资料的私有制基本上完成了社会主义的改造。丁、陈集团的成员们，正和所有资产阶级右派知识分子一样，作为一小撮已经失了旧皮、但又坚决不愿附上新皮的“毛”，对于社会主义（包括党的领导、集体主义、计划化、集中、纪律等等）表现得更加不能容忍。他们头脑中的“私有财产”（所谓“一本书主义”就是这种精神私有财产制的典型表现）就更加顽强地起来抗拒。加上去年的某些国际事件，特别是匈牙利事件，使他们更加冲昏头脑。于是陈企霞就估计：“匈牙利事件后的形势，对我们有利”了；冯雪峰就认为“人类没有希望”，“洪水快要冲破我们的大门”，而且号召人们“有冤报冤，有仇报仇”了。这个反党集团的一个颇为剽悍的骑士陈涌，竟然喊出“大变动的前夜到了”！和这个集团有密切联系、而在美术界充当另一反党集团的头目的江丰，就大大赞扬和煽动大民主，认为“我说话的机会到了”，认为现在城乡生活悬殊，“农民一经号召，就会有几万人起来反抗”了。丁、陈反党集团正在这样的对国内外形势完全错误的估计下，就重整旗鼓，密切配合社会上的资产阶级右派，向党和社会主义进行公开的凶猛的进攻。这批反党分子完全懂得堡垒是最容易从内部攻破的。所以正当章罗联盟疯狂地向我们革命的文艺阵地阴谋渗入的时候，正当吴祖光、萧乾、张友松、王若望、流沙河等右派分子向党和社会主义猖狂进攻的时候，丁、陈反党集团和江丰反党集团就毫不踌躇地树起白旗，实行从党组织的内部攻击领导核心的战术了。
    这个集团反党的口号是什么呢？他们和所有的资产阶级右派分子一样，阴险地套用党的整风的口号。他们用反对教条主义的幌子，来反对文艺应该接受共产主义世界观的指导，反对文艺应该为政治服务，反对文艺应该贯彻工农兵方向。他们用反对宗派主义的幌子，来反对文艺应该作为党和人民群众的事业，反对党对文艺的领导，反对党在文艺工作中的领导核心。他们恶毒地歪曲党的领导方针，丑化党的领导人。他们把党的领导机构和领导人描绘为目光短浅的、专事倾轧的宗派集团，这样来挑拨党与群众的关系，孤立党，打击党，企图把自己放在更高的领导岗位上，来实现他们的资产阶级的反动的文艺工作纲领。
    从丁、陈反党集团的全般发展历史看，有一个中心问题值得特别提出，这就是个人与党的关系、个人与人民群众集体之间的关系问题。冯雪峰自己检讨说，他入党三十年，但三十年来他同党的关系从来没有摆对过。这批反党分子可以说，毫无例外地都是组织上入党，思想上并未入党，而且基本上没有改造过来的资产阶级知识分子。他们都是极端的个人主义者。丁玲自己说：“我是一个顽强的个人主义野心家，一切想法和一切措施都是为了自己。”冯雪峰说，他的“个人主义根深蒂固”是“自我中心主义”。陈企霞则描写他的卑鄙的个人主义已经“发展到疯狂的报复主义”。事实确实是这样，这些人都是从极端严重的资产阶级个人主义（有些人还夹杂着野蛮的封建地主的压迫思想），发展到掉入反党、反人民、反社会主义的泥坑。
    以丁玲为例。丁玲出身于封建大地主家庭。她的父亲阔绰到这般程度，他看见人家骑马姿态好看，就派人重金买回许多匹白马，每匹都给配上白缎绣花马鞍，然后要人们骑着在他面前奔驰取乐。她母亲在自己的花园里专门架起一座秋千，来打着消遣。后来她的家庭没落了。就在这样的家庭里，再加上颓废享乐文学的影响，使丁玲的思想里深深地打上这个没落阶级的自私、骄傲和绝望的烙印。丁玲曾经自己分析她那时的思想“是一种中农意识”，（见丁：“我的创作生活”）这是不确实的。后来她接触到资产阶级民主的新思潮，很快地孕育起虚无主义的思想，在1922年她加入了无政府主义党。她热衷于资产阶级的妇女平权观点。1928年起她开始写小说。她的初作“莎菲女士的日记”中的主人公的思想实质上反映了作者当时的思想。莎菲女士是一个自我中心论者，她玩弄男性凌吉士，她得意她的“愚弄”别人、“扯谎”和“不诚实”，她终要  “让那高小子来尝一尝我的不柔顺，不近情理的倨傲和侮弄。”最后，她说，“好在在这宇宙间，我的生命只是我自己的玩品，我已浪费得尽够了。”“悄悄地活下来，悄悄地死去，啊！我可怜你，莎菲！”丁玲的这种思想二十多年来基本上没有改变过，某些方面还给发展了。1930年她参加左联工作，1932年加入党。到1933年5月就被捕，不久，她就在敌人面前屈服了，变节了。1936年她转到延安。她不但没有认识自己犯了十分严重的政治错误，好好地锻炼和改造自己，反而以名作家自居，对党对人民政府不满。党当时指出了她的错误，同时给以重要的工作岗位。但她保持着强烈的反感。于是在她的主持下，发表反革命分子王实味的“野百合花”，她自己亲自动笔写“三八节有感”和“在医院中”，污蔑党所领导的解放区。这些文章明显地暴露出她的思想的反党的性质。她所同意的“野百合花”，恶毒地污蔑当时群众对领导人员“感觉他们是异类”。在她的“三八节有感”里，丁玲把解放区描写得阴森漆黑，说妇女都处于“悲运”，而这种情况“在旧的社会里，她们或许会被称为可怜，薄命，然而在今天，都是自作孽，活该”。丁玲的这种对新社会的歪曲和攻讦，同今天资产阶级右派分子的抹煞一切、“今不如昔”的谰调，简直没有两样。无怪当时国民党反动派得到了丁玲这篇文章，如获至宝，正同今天美国国务院和蒋介石集团向章伯钧、储安平、葛佩琦赞佩不止一样。解放以后，丁玲的资产阶级个人主义思想得到进一步的发展，她更加热衷于争名誉、争地位、争享受，一直发展到企图夺取整个文艺阵地的领导权。
    以丁玲为首的反党集团其他主要成员也都是些极端个人主义者，同时在他们的思想里都有浓厚的阶级异己分子的敌对思想的因素。就是这一批人，讲个人第一主义，吹吹拍拍，拉拉扯扯，讲什么“良心”、“人性”、“友情”、“温暖”，平素好行小惠，言不及义；他们擅长小广播，播送流言蜚语，纠集一些对党和政府不满的分子，形成有形无形的集团。就是这批人，骄傲自大，把党所委托他主持的事业看作自己的独立王国，党对他们的事情批评不得，过问不得。就是这批人，当受到了党和上级批评的时候，就说是“某某人某某宗派打击他们，陷害他们”，而把自己装扮成一副可怜相，真像受了“委屈”的样子，争取群众，争取主动和有利的地位，等待时机向党进攻。
    对于这批人说来，党仅仅“是抽象的”存在，更正确地说，党只是一个招牌，是他们借以猎取名利的工具。他们对具体领导他们工作的党组织和领导人总看作是错误的，简直是罪大恶极的眼中钉、障碍物，是应该受到讨厌和反对的。他们永远把个人放在第一位，把自己的小集团放在第二位；党在他们的眼里是没有地位的。丁玲这批人说的“党在他们那里”，这倒真实地反映了他们的心理状态。他们认为自己的成就是个人努力的结果，否定党的领导和群众的支持对他们的某些成就所起的决定性的作用。他们认为自己对党有贡献、有功劳，他们给党以光荣，向党投了资，党对他们却欠了债。他们的成就和名望越大，党的法码便越轻，他们离开党便越远。他们认为党可有可无，当他们觉得党对他们有利的时候，他们便显得靠近党，把党侮弄一阵；当他们觉得党的存在对他们不利的时候，他便可以把党一脚踢开而无所顾惜。他们对党玩弄两面派手段，当面一套，背后又是一套。当他们猖狂地向党进攻的时候，他们甚至可以采取非法的地下阴谋活动的形式。丁玲集团和江丰集团的反党罪行事实上都已发展到这般卑鄙恶毒的程度。同时他们还同社会上的资产阶级右派分子，结成联合战线，向党和社会主义进攻。
    作为今天文艺界的一个紧急的和极其重要的任务，就是彻底揭露和粉碎反党集团的罪恶活动。我们必须肯定，党的文艺方针，无产阶级的文艺路线，在我国是已经取得了重大胜利的。在解放前的漫长的岁月里，不是有我们党所领导的以鲁迅为主将的左翼文艺运动的辉煌战绩么？不是有我们解放区为工农兵服务的革命文艺的巨大成就么？在解放以后的新中国，不是在文艺的各个部门都作出了很大的成绩么？但是，在我国，马克思主义和文艺确实还没有真正全面地和正确地结合起来。无产阶级的领导，我们党的领导，在许多文艺工作部门，对许多文艺工作者，确实还没有真正建立起来。这就是当前我国文艺战线上的最根本的问题。我国在今后十年到十五年内将用大力发展工业和农业，建立现代化工业和现代化农业的基础，为社会主义社会建立比较充分的物质基础。为要达到这个目的，作为上层建筑的意识形态部门（包括文艺），就应该充分发挥上层建筑的作用，加强党的马克思列宁主义的领导，加强对群众的社会主义教育，同时大力为国家培养工人阶级自己的知识界。在这样伟大的任务前面，我们文艺战线的基本任务，就是要尽可能迅速地确立起党的领导，正确和坚决地贯彻党的文艺路线，同时大力培养工人阶级自己的忠诚于社会主义事业的文学家、艺术家和文艺理论家。而当前进行的反对丁、陈反党集团的斗争，就是为着要实现这个基本任务所极端需要的步骤之一。
    在进行反对丁、陈反党集团的斗争的时候，我们又不能不吸取若干重要的也是痛切的教训。
    首先，我们必须特别警惕文艺界资产阶级个人主义思想的发展。全国胜利后，文艺界的这种追求个人名誉、地位、享受的个人主义倾向，在不少部门和不少人中间，已经发展到了非常可怕的地步。这些人的创作活动，首先是为了钱，为了成名，为了级别待遇。长春电影制片厂有个导演叫沙蒙，他导演了一部“上甘岭”，厂里给他酬金一千四百元，他大吵大闹；给他一千六百元，他还是不满。另外一个导演，叫吕班，竟然恬不知耻地在厂里号召“为人民币而奋斗！”有些剧作家和作曲家，从老艺人那里纪录下来传统的剧本和曲谱，这本来是好事，但他们竟把它们算作自己的创作，或者只写上自己的名字，不写上老艺人的名字，只为自己争了稿费，而不让老艺人得稿费，或者只分给他们很少的稿费。这一类腐朽的资产阶级个人主义思想对于我们的某些作家和艺术家已经侵蚀到如此之深，他们创作的愿望已被窒息，他们的作品已经失去了鼓舞人们前进的任何力量。他们之中的许多人已经再也配不上人类灵魂工程师的称号，他们已经堕落为人们思想的腐蚀剂和人类灵魂的蛀虫了！
    应该特别着重地指出，资产阶级个人主义思想和当前革命要求之间的矛盾从来没有像今天这么尖锐过。这是因为我国革命已经从资产阶级民主革命阶段进入社会主义革命阶段的缘故。现在资产阶级思想和社会主义已经处于直接对抗的地位。要就是无产阶级思想体系战胜资产阶级思想体系，要就是资产阶级思想体系战胜无产阶级思想体系。这是思想战线上你死我活的斗争，中间道路是没有的。资产阶级思想，对于社会主义，就是直接的敌对思想，我们必须彻底战胜它，才能胜利地进行社会主义建设。
    正因为资产阶级思想在今天阶级斗争中处于这样的地位，所以资产阶级个人主义十分严重的人就常常不免堕落成为不可救药的反党分子和资产阶级右派分子；同时，不少有相当严重的资产阶级个人主义、自由主义的人，常常容易落入右派分子和反党分子的魔掌，成为他们反党反社会主义的工具和“群众”。丁玲和江丰等等不是都自称自己“拥有群众”的么？这就足够引起人们的严重警惕的了。
    由此可知，在文艺界必须特别注意克服资产阶级个人主义。现在文艺界资产阶级个人主义思想比较普遍和严重，这也不是偶然的。这是因为现在的文艺界大多数出身于地主、资产阶级或上层小资产阶级，在旧中国受了较多的资产阶级教育；同时也因为我们多半从事个体的精神的劳动，特别容易脱离群众和脱离实际。所以，对于每一个从旧社会来的文艺工作者，资产阶级个人主义思想是并不那么容易克服的。这就需要我们特别的警惕和更大的努力。
    最后，我们对于错误的倾向和错误的思想作风，再不能采取自由主义的态度了。我们必须坚持正确的立场和原则，必须对各种错误思想及时地进行严肃的批判和斗争。自由主义、温情主义，只能纵容和助长错误，是腐蚀人们的毒草。两年来，我们对于丁、陈集团的错误，江丰集团的错误，都曾进行过批判。但是这些批判都做得不彻底，再加上这些集团的反党思想根子深，劲儿大（当然这是主要原因）就使它们发展到今天这样严重的地步。我们文艺界通行一种风气，为了“照顾”文艺工作的特点和文艺工作者的特点，对于错误倾向和错误的思想作风，常常作无原则的迁就和让步，据说这是为了团结和争取多数。但是经验告诉我们，这样做，非但不能达到团结和争取多数之目的，反而只能闭塞人们的头脑，降低党的威信，损害有原则的团结。鉴于过去的教训，我们这番一定要把反对右派和反党分子的斗争进行到底，取得彻底的胜利，决不可半途而废。对于一般性的错误也不能再来什么自由主义和温情主义。这样我们才能保卫得住马克思主义的文艺事业，并且使它不断发展。
