Xinhua News Agency, August 1st: The anti-rightist struggle in the Ministries of Agriculture, Forestry, Water Conservancy, Land Reclamation, and Aquatic Products is unfolding extensively. Rightist elements in these ministries have already become isolated.

After the start of the rectification movement, rightist elements in these ministries used big-character posters, wall newspapers, and various meetings to viciously slander and attack the Communist Party and some of the movements and work led by the Communist Party. Zeng Xianpu, a rightist element in the Ministry of Agriculture and the person in charge of the Agricultural Ministry's general branch of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, said: "What exactly does the Ministry of Agriculture do? I'm not clear." He believed that the annual agricultural production conference summaries, which always stated that "achievements are primary, and shortcomings are unavoidable," were formulaic. He fabricated rumors, saying that sometimes the people writing the summaries didn't even attend the meetings and "just made up the summaries behind closed doors." He also cursed the directors and bureau chiefs of the Ministry of Agriculture as "cats" and "mice," slandering the ministry's leading cadres' work style as so bad that "even the Kuomintang wasn't like this." He and other rightist elements, Shen Zengkan, a member of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, and Liu Guofang, a member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, attacked the promotion of Xinjiang cotton planting experience both inside and outside the ministry. Shen Zengkan proposed and Liu Guofang wrote a big-character poster falsely claiming that due to the promotion of Xinjiang cotton planting experience, last year "tens of millions of mu (of cotton fields) had reduced production," and this year "two chi of cloth coupons are being used as one chi." Shen Zengkan also provoked the relationship between the Communist Party and the masses, falsely accusing the Ministry of Agriculture of "only considering class origin," "background," and "history" in its use of cadres.

Wang Haibo, a rightist element in the Aquatic Products Ministry and the person in charge of the Aquatic Products Ministry branch of the Jiusan Society, wantonly denigrated the national system and hinted to other rightist elements to rise up and demand amendments to the constitution. Li Yu, a rightist element in the Water Conservancy Ministry, slandered our country's democratic life, saying "The Communist Party's democracy is fake and not as good as the democracy of imperialism." Gao Yan, a rightist element and member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang in this ministry, cursed Communist Party members as "truly lacking in virtue," saying: "Good Party members are in the minority, and bad Party members are common." Guo Shufan, a rightist element in the Ministry of Agriculture, was investigated after someone reported him during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and he shouted "The suppression of counter-revolutionaries violates the constitution." He slandered "The office of the five-person group for the suppression of counter-revolutionaries is the Kuomintang's military police," he shouted that he wanted to "avenge" the targets of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, be a "pioneer," "fight," and further challenged to smear more than 90% of Communist Party members, "to let Chairman Mao see."

The vast majority of staff in each ministry were extremely indignant at the attacks and slanders of the rightist elements and, since mid-June, have held various meetings and put up big-character posters and wall newspapers to counterattack the rightist elements. The staff of the Ministry of Agriculture cited a large number of facts and figures to illustrate the achievements in agricultural work, refuting the lies of Zeng Xianpu and others who attempted to negate the achievements in agricultural work. Yang Shufan, Hu Jingliang, and several other cotton experts pointed out that the cotton production decline last year was due to severe disasters in the main cotton-producing areas, not because the promotion of Xinjiang cotton planting experience had gone wrong. They also cited some statistics to illustrate the role of Xinjiang cotton planting experience in increasing cotton production.

Through the exposure of the vast majority of staff, the ugly faces of the rightist elements in these ministries have been revealed. Some people who had been influenced, roped in, or used by the rightist elements also began to draw a clear line between themselves and the rightist elements and rose up to expose the rightist elements. In this situation, the rightist elements have begun to be isolated, and some rightist groups have fallen apart. Currently, the staff of each ministry are continuing to hold various meetings to besiege the rightist elements who still refuse to confess their crimes.

    农业、林业、水利、农垦、水产等部反右派斗争得胜
    右派集团瓦解右派分子陷于孤立
    据新华社1日讯　农业部、林业部、水利部、农垦部和水产部的反右派分子斗争正在广泛展开。这几个部的右派分子已经陷于孤立。
    整风运动开始以后，这几个部的右派分子利用大字报、墙报和各种会议，向共产党以及共产党所领导的一些运动和工作，进行了恶毒的诬蔑和攻击。农业部的右派分子、农工民主党农业部总支部负责人曾宪朴说：“农业部究竟是干什么的？我不明确”，他认为每年农业生产会议的总结都提“成绩是主要的，缺点是难免的”是公式化，他造谣说，有时候写总结的人连会议都不参加“就闭门做出了总结”。他还大骂农业部司、局长以上领导干部是“猫”和“老鼠”，诬蔑部的领导干部作风恶劣到连“国民党也不过如此”。他和另外一些右派分子农工民主党党员沈曾侃、民革成员刘国芳分别在部外部内攻击新疆植棉经验的推广工作。沈曾侃提辞刘国芳执笔写大字报造谣说：由于推广了新疆植棉经验，去年“几千万亩（棉田）减产”，今年“二尺布票当一尺用”。沈曾侃还挑拨共产党和群众的关系，他诬蔑农业部在使用干部上是“唯阶级论”、“出身论”和“历史论”。
    水产部的右派分子九三学社水产部支部负责人王海波，肆意诋毁国家制度，并且暗示其他右派分子要起来要求修改宪法。水利部右派分子李域对我国的民主生活横加诬蔑，说“共产党是假民主，还不如帝国主义的民主”。这个部的民革成员右派分子高炎大骂共产党员“真缺德”，他说：“好党员是少数的，坏党员是普遍的”。农业部的右派分子郭树藩，在肃反中有人检举，受到审查，他便大喊“肃反违犯宪法”。诬蔑“肃反五人小组办公室是国民党的宪兵队”，他大叫要为肃反对象“报仇”，要打“先锋”，要“拚”，并且进一步挑战，要把90％以上的共产党员搞臭，“叫毛主席看看”。
    各部的广大工作人员，对右派分子的攻击和诬蔑极为愤慨，从6月中旬以来，即先后举行各种会议，出大字报和墙报，向右派分子举行反击。农业部的工作人员，举出大量事实和数字，说明农业工作方面的成绩，驳斥了曾宪朴等人企图否定农业工作成绩的谰言。杨树藩、胡竟良等几位棉花专家指出：去年棉花减产是因为主要产棉区受灾严重，并不是因为推广新疆植棉经验坏了事，他们还举出一些统计数字，说明新疆植棉经验在棉花增产上所起的作用。
    经过广大工作人员的揭发，这几个部里的右派分子的丑恶面目暴露出来了。受右派分子影响或被拉拢、利用过的一些人，也开始跟右派分子划清界限，起而揭发右派分子。在这种情况下，右派分子已经开始孤立，有的右派集团已经七零八落。现在，各部的工作人员正在继续举行各种会议，围攻还不低头认罪的右派分子。
