    "King of Plastics", Three-wheeled Vehicles...
    Shanghai Trials More Than Two Thousand New Products
    (Our newspaper's Shanghai dispatch, 9th) Shanghai's working class, with its powerful technical strength, has a very heavy task of trial-producing new products this year. Shanghai's local industrial departments plan to trial-produce more than two thousand new products this year, of which more than one thousand seven hundred can be successfully trial-produced and officially put into production this year.
    Among these two thousand new products, one-third are in the field of chemical industry. Among them are various plastics with extremely wide uses, high-grade paints used in the construction and shipbuilding industries, high-grade dyes needed by the printing and dyeing industry, and many valuable medicines. Plans to manufacture plastics using waste gas from the Shanghai Refinery have been drawn up. A polytetrafluoroethylene, known as the "King of Plastics," can be trial-produced in small samples within the year. This is a plastic with extremely strong acid and heat resistance, and it can replace metal to manufacture various parts. A small factory, the Zili Chemical Factory, can currently produce 25 kilograms of polystyrene per day. This plastic is an essential insulating material for ultra-short wave, radar, television, and other equipment, and it is also the best sound and heat insulation building material. In addition, nylon 66 and nylon 11, made from cottonseed hulls, corn cobs, rice bran, and castor beans, will also be successfully trial-produced this year.
    There are more than one thousand new products in the light and textile industries to meet the material and cultural needs of the people and export needs. These include high-grade hot water bottles, poplin raincoats, magnetic tape recording inks, variegated nylon wool socks, etc. There are also some new products that supply the needs of agriculture and transportation, such as hydro-generators, small power station equipment, three-wheeled vehicles, and automobile oil clocks.

    “塑料之王”、三轮汽车……
    上海试制两千多种新产品
    本报上海9日电　拥有强大技术力量的上海工人阶级，今年试制新产品的任务十分繁重。上海地方工业部门今年计划试制的新产品有两千多种，其中有一千七百多种今年可以试制成功并正式投入生产。
    这两千多种新产品中，有三分之一是化学工业方面的。其中有用途极其广泛的各种塑料，有建筑、造船业使用的高级油漆，有印染工业需要的高级染料，以及许多贵重药品。利用上海炼油厂的废气制造塑料的计划，已经拟订出来。有一种号称“塑料之王”的聚四氟乙稀，年内可以试制出小样。这是一种耐酸、耐热能力极强的塑料，它可以代替金属制造各种零件。有一个小型厂——自力化工厂，目前已经每天可以生产二十五公斤的聚苯乙稀。这种塑料是超短波、雷达、电视等设备必要的绝缘材料，也是隔音、绝热的最好的建筑材料。此外，利用棉籽壳、玉米芯子、米糠和蓖麻子为原料制造的尼龙六六和尼龙一一，今年也将试制成功。
    为满足人民物质文化生活和出口需要的轻工业和纺织工业的新产品，共有一千多种。其中有高级热水袋、府绸防雨衣、磁带录音油墨、杂色尼龙羊毛袜等。还有一部分新产品，是供应农业和交通运输业需要的水轮发电机，小型发电站设备，三轮汽车，汽车油丝钟等。
