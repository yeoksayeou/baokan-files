    Famous Xiang Embroidery Flowers
    By our reporter Ai Ling
    When people see brocade, they naturally think of the famous Xiang embroidery. In the exhibition hall of the National Arts and Crafts Artists' Representative Conference, Xiang embroidery attracted many viewers. Here, I saw embroidery experts particularly admiring a photograph. The photograph showed an old lady dressed in phoenix coronet and ceremonial robes, probably from the Guangxu era. This aroused my question: Why were they particularly interested in this photo? Later, seeing the experts admiring it and exclaiming in surprise, "The embroidery is truly masterful!" "Exquisite embroidery!" I realized that they were praising the superb skills of the person who embroidered this portrait. It is said that this embroidered portrait is still on display in Shanghai and is praised as a rare embroidery work in our country.
    This classic embroidery piece was originally the work of Liao Jiahui, the representative of the Hunan Xiang embroidery industry who attended the Artists' Representative Conference.
    For forty years, Liao Jiahui has embroidered millions of bright and beautiful flowers that never fade, and also many vivid portraits. The pale green hibiscus flowers she embroiders look like they are growing out of the brocade like water lilies emerging from the water. People ask her in surprise what is the trick to embroidering flowers so realistically? She holds up a real flower and says with a smile, "What trick is there? We just embroider it the way the real flower is!" You see, generally, when the petals are not yet open, the veins of the flower cannot be seen. Only when the petals are in full bloom do the veins fully appear. However, newly opened flowers are different; sometimes they stretch out two or three petals like they are being coquettish, and at that time, there are only shadows of the veins on the petals, but people don't embroider these shadows. The trick to Liao Jiahui's embroidery of hibiscus flowers is that she embroiders the faint shadows. Liao Jiahui has loved embroidery since she was a child and loves growing flowers even more. Sometimes she goes to the garden to carefully study the characteristics of the flowers. As long as the embroidered flowers can give people a sense of beauty and reality, she doesn't mind how much effort and labor it takes. Often, a small petal has to be matched with more than a dozen colors of thread.
    However, Liao Jiahui is even better at embroidering portraits, and portraits require a higher level of embroidery technology. Liao Jiahui has rich embroidery experience. Her many and unique needlework techniques can bring out the skin tone, underwear, and outerwear of a person. When embroidering the eyes, in addition to using many and unique needlework techniques, she also uses a silk thread that is almost invisible and intangible, embroidering layer upon layer. She splits a strand of silk thread as thick as a mung bean into one hundred and eighty strands, and it doesn't even touch her hand when embroidering. What an amazing technique!
    Liao Jiahui's mother was also a skilled embroiderer. Liao Jiahui began to formally embroider flowers, birds, and animals at the age of thirteen; at the age of twenty, she could embroider portraits and became her mother's best assistant. Seeing that her daughter was growing up, her mother introduced her to potential husbands, wanting to find a happy path for her daughter. But Liao Jiahui said, "Mom, how can poor people have a happy path? It's better to stay at home and live with Mom." From then on, Liao Jiahui stayed by her mother's side, working hard all day long, never leaving the flower frame day and night, embroidering one piece after another. This young girl placed her love on embroidery and embroidered her good wishes on brocade. However, soon her mother passed away, and her second brother also died of illness, leaving her older brother and younger sister to depend on each other. The brother could paint, and the sister could embroider, spending long, cold, and bitter days.
    The brother and sister had superb skills, and many outstanding embroidery works won fame at home and abroad at that time. However, they received very little labor compensation, and their lives were very difficult. Her brother finally died in poverty and illness. Liao Jiahui was heartbroken and cried out to the sky, "Alas! I embroider a happy and complete life for others, but what I embroider for myself is withered grass and faded flowers...?" Liao Jiahui didn't understand the root of the suffering at that time. In order to protest the torment of fate, she threw away her embroidery needle, dismantled the flower frame, and returned to the countryside to live in seclusion for nine whole years.
    As soon as Changsha was liberated, the People's Government vigorously rescued the life of Xiang embroidery, and established the "Red Star" Xiang Embroidery Factory. One day, Liao Jiahui suddenly received a letter and a pair of glasses, brought by her nephew. The nephew said, "Aunt, Chairman Mao is here, the days for Xiang embroidery to rise have come." At the same time, the Secretary of the Changsha Municipal Party Committee came to visit her, and international friends came to pay her respects. Only then did she understand that the suffering of the poor had come to an end. She picked up her old embroidery needle and embroidered a portrait of Chairman Mao overnight.
    Now she is a teacher for the girls in the Changsha Xiang Embroidery Production Cooperative. In recent years, under her leadership, she has embroidered many outstanding embroidery works, including a giant portrait "The Great Meeting" more than ten feet high, which received extremely high praise when it was exhibited in Moscow. She happily said to people, "I have never seen Xiang embroidery as prosperous as it is today." She plans to train ten young girls within three years and let them have the same artistic level as herself. (Attached picture)

### 湘绣名花

    湘绣名花
    本报记者　艾玲
    看到锦绣，人们自然想到中外驰名的湘绣。就在全国工艺美术艺人代表会议的展览室里，湘绣品吸引了众多的观众。在这里，我见到刺绣行家们特别欣赏的是一张照片，照片里面坐着一个穿戴凤冠霞佩的大概是光绪年代服装的官宦老太太。这引起我的疑问：他们为什么对这张照片特别发生兴趣呢？后来看到行家们一边鉴赏，一边露出惊奇的神态在赞叹：“绣得真到家啦！”“绣绝了！”于是我才知道他们赞佩的是刺绣这张画像的人那种高超的技巧。据说这个绣像现在仍在上海展览着，誉称为我国稀有的刺绣作品。
    这张古典刺绣品，原来就是出席艺人代表中的湖南湘绣业代表——廖家惠同志旧时的杰作。
    四十年来，廖家惠绣过千万朵鲜艳美丽而又永开不谢的花朵，也绣过不少的神态活现的画像。她绣淡白绿色的芙蓉花，真像一朵朵出水芙蓉从锦绣上长出来一样。人们惊奇地问她有什么窍门能把花绣成这样逼真？她拿着一朵真花笑着说：“这有什么窍门呢？真花是个什么样，我们就绣它个什么样呗！”你们看，一般花瓣未开时，花筋是看不到的，只有花瓣盛开时，花筋才完全显现出来。可是，刚开的花就不一样，它有时像撒娇似的先伸张两三瓣，那时花瓣上只有花筋的影子，人们却没有绣出这个影子来。原来她绣芙蓉花的窍门就是把若隐若现的影子绣出来了。廖家惠自小喜爱绣花，更爱养花，有时还到花园里细心琢磨花的特征。只要绣出的花能给人以美的真实感，要付出多少心血和劳力，是不计较的。往往一个小花瓣，就得配上十几种颜色的线。
    不过，廖家惠更擅长的是刺绣人像，而人像需要有更高度的刺绣技术。廖家惠有着丰富的刺绣经验，她那多而稀奇的针法，能把一个人身上的肤色、内衣、外衣浮现出来。绣眼睛的时候她除了要使用多而稀奇的针法外，还要用一种几乎看不见、摸不着的丝线绣了一层又一层。她把一缕像绿豆一般粗的丝线，劈分成一百八十股，绣起来还不触到手上。这是多么惊人的手法！
    廖家惠的母亲也是绣花的能手。廖家惠十三岁就开始正式刺绣花卉、鸟兽……；二十岁会绣人像，成为母亲最好的助手。母亲看见女儿长大了，就给她说媒，找婆家，想为女儿找一条幸福的道路。可是廖家惠说：“妈妈呀，咱们穷人那有幸福的路走？不如在家和妈妈一起过日子。”从此，廖家惠就守在母亲跟前终日辛勤劳动，日夜没离开过花架，绣完一幅又一幅。这个年青的少女，把爱情寄托在绣花上，把自己的善良愿望绣在锦缎上。可是，不久母亲离开人间了，她的二哥也病殁了；留下大哥和妹妹相依为命。哥哥会绘画，妹妹会绣花，度着漫长的清寒苦日。
    兄妹俩手艺高超，许多出色的绣品当时在国内外都赢得了盛名。可是，他们得到的劳动报酬很少，生活非常困苦。哥哥终于在贫病交迫下死去了。廖家惠一时心痛欲绝，泣不成声地仰天长叹：“唉！我给人家绣的是花好月圆，为什么给自己绣下的是草枯花萎……？”廖家惠当时不明白苦难的根源，为了抗议命运的折磨，丢弃了绣花针，拆毁了花架，回到乡间隐居了整整九年。
    长沙刚解放，人民政府大力抢救湘绣的生命。办起“红星”湘绣厂。有一天，廖家惠忽然接到一封信和一副眼镜，是侄儿捎来的。侄儿说：“姑妈，毛主席来啦，湘绣出头的日子到了。”也在这个时候，长沙市委书记来访她，国际友人来拜望她，她才明白穷人的苦难熬到头了。她拾起旧年的绣花针，连夜绣出一幅毛主席像。
    现在她是长沙湘绣生产社姑娘们的老师。几年来，由她带领着绣出许多出色的绣品，其中有一幅一丈多高的巨型画像“伟大的会见”，在莫斯科展览时受到极高的评价，她高兴地对人说：“我从来没有见过湘绣像今天这样兴隆过。”她计划三年内培养出十个年轻姑娘，让她们具有和自己一样的艺术水平。（附图片）
