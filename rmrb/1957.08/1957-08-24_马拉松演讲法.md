    “Marathon Speech Method”
    The so-called "marathon speech method" is a strange phenomenon in the United States Congress. Senators can use this method to obstruct proceedings and resist a certain bill. The method is to take advantage of the opportunity for free speech in the process of discussing a bill, making lengthy speeches, trying to delay the time so that the bill cannot be fully discussed before the adjournment, and cannot be voted on; or to exhaust everyone and agree to put it aside.
    According to "U.S. News & World Report," a bill in the U.S. Congress in 1846 was resisted by the "marathon speech method" for two months, and the anti-lynching bill in 1938 was resisted by the "marathon speech method" for thirty-four days. In 1953, Senator Wayne Morse used this method to oppose the offshore oil law, and gave a continuous speech for twenty-two hours and twenty-six minutes.
    Although the U.S. Congress has a so-called "termination of discussion procedure" to stop the "marathon speech method," invoking this procedure requires the approval of more than two-thirds of the senators.

    “马拉松演讲法”
    所谓“马拉松演讲法”是美国国会中的一种怪现象。参议员可以用这种方法来阻挠议事抵制某项议案。这种办法是在某项议案的讨论过程里，利用自由发言的机会发表冗长的演说，竭力拖延时间，使该项议案在休会以前不能尽量讨论，无法举行表决；或者是把大家弄得精疲力竭，同意把它搁置起来。
    据“美国新闻与世界报道”说，1846年美国国会的一项法案就被“马拉松演讲法”抵制了两个月，1938年的反私刑法案被“马拉松演讲法”抵制了三十四天。1953年，参议员魏纳·摩尔斯为反对海上采油法案使用这个办法，曾连续发了二十二小时零二十六分钟的言。
    虽然美国国会有所谓“终止讨论规程”来制止“马拉松演讲法”，但是援用这个规程需要有三分之二以上的参议员的赞成。
