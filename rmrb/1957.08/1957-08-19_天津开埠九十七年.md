The waves of Bohai Bay, a century ago, surged and swelled as they do today, and the Dagu Forts stood majestically. But at that time, China was powerless to resist imperialist economic aggression. All foreign ships could enter Tianjin Port, the northern gateway to the motherland, without any formalities. Today's Tianjin Port is different. It has become a solemn gateway to the motherland. All foreign ships must raise our national five-star red flag outside Dagu Port. After the "Joint Inspection Team" composed of our border inspection personnel, port supervision personnel, customs officers, and quarantine personnel boards the ship for inspection and issues a navigation flag, it is guided into the port by our pilots.

Tianjin was opened as a commercial port in 1860 when the Qing government was defeated by the Anglo-French imperialist forces and forced to sign the Treaty of Beijing. From then on, foreign merchant ships sailed in one after another, and foreign banks, trading houses, shipping agencies, oil depots, warehouses, and commodity inspection companies were established one after another, greedily sucking the blood and marrow of the Chinese people. According to the historical records preserved by Tianjin Customs from the opening of the port in 1861 to the eve of liberation in 1948, in those eighty-eight years, various imperialist countries plundered more than 60,000 ships of valuable agricultural, animal, mineral products, and handicrafts such as cotton, hemp, peanuts, wool, pig bristles, hides, eggs, coal, salt, lace, and carpets from the Chinese countryside through Tianjin Port. If these many ships were lined up end to end, they could stretch all the way from Tianjin to Hong Kong. Imperialist countries plundered large quantities of extremely cheap raw materials from our country, processed them, and then transported them back to our country for dumping. In addition, the import of large quantities of poisons—opium—caused Tianjin Port's foreign trade to suffer trade deficits year after year. The total amount of trade deficits in eighty-eight years reached more than 1.2 billion U.S. dollars (a large amount of smuggling was not included). This situation fundamentally changed in 1949, the first year after Tianjin's liberation. In eight years, the import and export trade volume basically maintained a balance, with a slight surplus of more than 60 million U.S. dollars.

From the opening of Tianjin Port, the power of the customs—the key to the motherland's gate—was controlled by imperialism. They managed our tariffs, and all goods entering the country were only taxed "five out of every hundred in value." Moreover, many luxury goods needed by so-called foreigners in China, such as perfumes, jewelry, leather shoes, and cigars, were completely tax-free. This situation was fundamentally changed after Tianjin's liberation in 1949. From the changes in the structure of imported goods in the ninety-seven years since the opening of Tianjin, we can clearly see the role this port has played in the changes in our country's economic life. This can be roughly divided into three periods. The first period was from 1861 to 1920, the period of the Qing government, the Northern Warlords, and the various imperialist powers. In the import manifests of all customs yearbooks during these sixty years, the first column was always opium, which was euphemistically called "foreign medicine." The second period was from 1921 to 1948, mainly the period of the Chiang Kai-shek, Wang Jingwei, Japanese, and American imperialist rule. During this period, opium was imported through smuggling, and the main imported goods were various consumer goods and luxury goods. The third period has been since 1949, the period when the people are masters of their own affairs, and various means of production and construction materials have occupied the most important position.

After the liberation of Tianjin, the structure of export commodities also underwent major changes. Before liberation, Tianjin Port's export commodities had almost no modern machine-made industrial products. Starting in 1953, the Tianjin Municipal Foreign Trade Bureau for the first time divided industrial products as an independent item in the export commodity classification table. In that year, the export value of industrial products accounted for 6.81% of the total value of export commodities. In the first half of this year, it has reached 36.36%, surpassing agricultural products, mineral products, animal products, and local specialty products to rank first. According to incomplete statistics, since liberation, Tianjin port has transformed the import of as many as 270 kinds of industrial products into exports, some of which are listed as "embargoed" materials by capitalist countries, such as glycerin and red phosphorus.

Under the devastation of various imperialist powers, the industries that initially arose in Tianjin were only some industries that simply processed agricultural and animal products for export. Later, a few modern manufacturing industries such as soap making and matches were established. After the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, Britain, France, Japan, and other countries successively established factories and enterprises in Tianjin, destroying China's national industry on the spot. It was only during the First World War that the imperialist powers had no time to look east, and Tianjin's national industry had some opportunities for development. Some of the more important factories, such as Hengyuan and Beiyang textile mills, Jiuda and Yongli Chemical Companies, Shoufeng and Fuxing flour mills, and Renli and Dongya wool and linen textile mills, were built during this period. But the good times did not last long. After the end of the war, the imperialist powers made a comeback, and our young national industry immediately collapsed. By the time the War of Resistance Against Japan broke out in 1937, almost all of Tianjin's industries were occupied by the Japanese, or were forced to process military products for Japan. At the same time, the Japanese also made a large amount of investment in Tianjin. According to existing data, there were 1,934 Japanese industrial enterprises in Tianjin in 1936, which increased to 6,866 in 1940. Tianjin's economy was completely manipulated by Japanese imperialism. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, American commodities flooded into the Tianjin market like a landslide, with an unprecedented variety and quantity, encompassing everything from clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Tianjin's national industry was silent under this strong pressure. According to statistics, from 1947 to the eve of liberation, the number of machinery manufacturing enterprises in Tianjin decreased from 363 to 219, the number of iron foundries decreased from 68 to 47, and only 20 of the 52 hardware smelting enterprises were operating. Only 20 of the 97 dyeing and finishing enterprises were operating, and most of the 63 rubber factories were shut down.

After liberation, Tianjin's industry was reborn. In 1952, several major products, such as steel, cotton cloth, electricity, cotton yarn, flour, and cigarettes, all broke the record for the highest annual output before liberation, with steel increasing by more than 27 times. The implementation of the country's first five-year plan brought greater development to Tianjin's industry. More than 400 new and expanded factories were built by Tianjin's local industry on the original basis, and the total investment was equivalent to 2.5 times the total fixed investment accumulated in the decades before liberation. Many previously empty places now have rows of new factories, and some small factories that were not previously noticed now have large chimneys. The main products that are currently being produced and trial-produced in these new and expanded factories include steel, machine tools, electronic instruments, watches, cameras, cellophane, and advanced pesticides. According to preliminary calculations by the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Statistics, the total value of Tianjin's industrial production in 1956 increased by 8.33 times compared to 1936 before the War of Resistance Against Japan, and by 5.72 times compared to 1947 before liberation.

This year is the ninety-seventh year since the opening of Tianjin. The changes in Tianjin in the eight years since liberation compared to the eighty-eight years before liberation are so huge. How did all these changes come about? People will come to the conclusion without explanation: it was the result of the Chinese Communist Party leading the people in their struggle. However, recently, a group of mad bourgeois rightists have insisted on obliterating all the achievements made by the Communist Party in leading our country. Alright! Let them come to Tianjin and see!

    天津开埠九十七年
    新华社记者　尹崇敬　黄军　蒋先凡
    渤海湾的波涛，在一个世纪以前也像今天一样汹涌澎湃，起伏万丈，大沽口的炮台巍然矗立，但那时候的中国，是没有力量阻挡住帝国主义的经济侵略的，所有外来船只可以不经任何手续一直开进祖国北方的门户天津港。今天的天津港可不同了，它已成为祖国一个庄严的门户，一切外国的船只，到大沽口外就得升起我国的五星红旗，我国边防检查人员、港务监督人员、海关人员和检疫人员组成的“联检队”登轮检查以后，发给一面通航旗，才由我国的引水员引进港。
    天津是1860年清政府被英、法帝国主义的联军打败，被迫签订北京条约时开辟为商埠的。从那时起，外国商船一艘艘地开进来了，外国银行、贸易行、轮船代理行、油库、仓栈以及商品检验公司等，相继设立起来，他们贪婪地吸吮中国人民的血液膏脂。据天津海关保有的从1861年开关到1948年解放前夕为止的全部历史年册记载，这八十八年间，各个帝国主义国家通过天津港从中国农村掠夺去的棉、麻、花生、羊毛、猪鬃、皮张、蛋品、煤炭、食盐、花边、地毯等珍贵的农、畜、矿产品和手工艺品达六万多船，如果把这么多船只首尾相连排起来，可以从天津一直排到香港。帝国主义国家在我国掠取去大量价格极为低廉的原料，加工后再运来我国倾销，再加上大批毒物——鸦片的输入，使天津港的对外贸易形成连年入超。八十八年间的入超总数达十二亿多美元（大量的走私尚未计入）。这种情况在天津解放以后的第一年——1949年就根本改变了，八年间进出口的贸易额基本上保持了平衡，还略微出超了六千多万美元。
    天津港从开埠时起，海关大权——祖国大门的钥匙就给帝国主义掌握去了。他们管理我国的关税，一切货物入口只得“值百抽五”，而且所谓在华外国人需用的许多奢侈品如香水、首饰、皮鞋、雪茄烟等等还一律免税。这种情况直到1949年天津解放后才根本改变。从天津开埠九十七年来进口物资结构的变化中，可以清楚地看出这个港口在我国经济生活变化中所起的作用。这大致可分为三个时期，第一个时期从1861年到1920年，清政府、北洋军阀和各帝国主义统治时期，这六十年所有海关年册的进口货表上，最前面的第一栏总是鸦片，表上还美其名为“洋药类”；第二个时期从1921年到1948年，主要是蒋记、汪记国民党和日、美帝国主义统治时期，这时鸦片以走私方式进口，进口的主要商品是各种各样的消费品，奢侈品；第三个时期从1949年以来，人民当家作主的时期，各种各样的生产资料、建设物资占了最主要的地位。
    天津解放以后，出口商品的结构也起了重大的变化。解放以前天津港出口的商品几乎完全没有现代机器工业的制品，从1953年开始，天津市对外贸易局才第一次在出口商品分类表上划出工业品作为独立的一项，当年工业品的出口价值占了出口商品总值的6.81％，今年上半年已占到36.36％，超过农产品、矿产品、畜产品、土特产品而跃居首位。据不完全的统计，解放以来，天津口岸变进口为出口的工业品已达二百七十种之多，其中还有一些是被资本主义国家列为“禁运”物资的，如甘油、赤磷等。
    在各帝国主义的摧残下，在天津最初兴起的工业只是一些为农畜产品出口作简单加工的行业，后来，设立了造胰、火柴等少数现代制造工业。1895年甲午战争以后，英、法、日本等国先后在天津设立了工厂企业，就地摧残中国民族工业。只是在第一次世界大战期间，帝国主义无暇东顾，天津的民族工业才获得一些发展的机会，一些较重要的工厂，如恒源、北洋等纱厂，久大、永利化学公司，寿丰、福星等面粉厂，仁立、东亚等毛麻纺织厂都是这一时期兴建的。但好景不长，大战结束后，帝国主义卷土重来，我国年青的民族工业立刻就垮了下来。到1937年抗战爆发后，天津所有工业几乎都为日本人所占，或被迫为日本作军事加工，同时，日本人还在天津作了大量投资，据现有资料表明，1936年日本在天津的工业是一千九百三十四户，1940年就增加到六千八百六十六户，天津的经济完全被日本帝国主义操纵了。抗战胜利后，美国商品又如排山倒海之势倾销到天津市场上来，品种种类之多，数量之大都是空前未有的，衣食住行无所不包。天津的民族工业在这强大的压力下，已无声无息了，据统计，从1947年到解放前夕，天津市机器制造业从三百六十三户减少到二百一十九户，铸铁业从六十八户减少到四十七户，五金冶制业的五十二家中，开工者仅有二十余家，九十七户的染整业也只有二十户开工，六十三家橡胶厂，大部停工。
    解放以后，天津工业才获得了新生。1952年，几种主要产品如钢、棉布、电、棉纱、面粉、卷烟等，都突破了解放前最高年产量的纪录，其中钢增加了二十七倍多。国家第一个五年计划的执行，给天津工业带来了更大的发展，天津地方工业在原基础上新建和扩建了四百多个工厂，总投资额相当于解放前几十年所积累的固定投资总值的二点五倍。许多过去空旷的地方，现在出现了栉比相连的新工厂，一些过去并不引人注意的小工厂，现在也矗立起大烟囱。现在这些新建和扩建的工厂中，正在生产和试生产的主要产品有钢材、工作母机、电子仪器、手表、照相机、玻璃纸和高级农药等。据天津市统计局初步计算，1956年天津市工业生产总值比抗战前的1936年增加了八点三三倍，比解放前的1947年增加了五点七二倍。
    今年是天津开埠的第九十七年了，解放以后八年多的天津比之解放以前八十八年的天津所起的变化是如此巨大。这一切的变化是怎样得来的？人们不必解释就会得出结论：是中国共产党领导人民进行斗争得来的。但是，近来很有一批丧心病狂的资产阶级右派分子，硬要抹煞共产党领导我们国家所取得的一切成就。好吧！让他们到天津来看看吧！　（新华社专稿）（附图片）
