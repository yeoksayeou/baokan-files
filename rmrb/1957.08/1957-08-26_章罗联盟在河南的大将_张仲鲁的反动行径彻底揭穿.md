Reported from Zhengzhou on the 25th by our correspondent Zhang Jianhong: In the recent series of symposiums held by the Henan Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, people have used irrefutable facts to expose the counter-revolutionary face of Zhang Zhonglu, Deputy Director of the Provincial Department of Transportation and a key member of the Zhang-Luo Anti-Party Clique in Henan.

It was revealed that in April of this year, when Zhang Zhonglu attended the national work conference of the China Democratic League in Beijing, he secretly plotted with key members of the Zhang-Luo Anti-Party Clique, such as Zhang Yunchuan, Wang Yifan, and Yang Yitang, to develop the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party in Henan. After returning to the province, he and Zhang Yunchuan discussed the development plan through Zhang Yunchuan's documents and letters. After the Party began its rectification campaign, Zhang Yunchuan came to Henan and conveyed Zhang Bojun's intention to have Zhang Zhonglu serve as the head of the Henan organization of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party and to transfer Zhang Bojun's confidant, Hou Ruihuan, to be his assistant. Zhang Zhonglu and Zhang Yunchuan jointly decided to develop 100,000 members of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party in Henan, with the targets being those who were dissatisfied with the Party, and the rightists Zhang Jingwu and Luo Shengwu were to be absorbed first.

Zhang Zhonglu is an insidious rightist. He pretends to be progressive on the surface, asking to join the Party, but behind his back, he slanders the Party at every turn and believes that those who are close to the Party are only pretending to be active.

During the period of "Great Blooming and Free Airing of Views," Zhang Zhonglu did not participate in the airing of views on the surface, but behind the scenes he promoted Chu Anping's reactionary remarks and sowed discord between the democratic parties and the Communist Party.

Zhang Zhonglu once held the position of Deputy Director of the Coal Mine General Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry. At that time, he used his personal connections to introduce eleven counter-revolutionary elements to work in the bureau, including Fan Chengxu, the secretary of the Kuomintang Xiuwu County Party Department, who had arrested more than ten revolutionary comrades. He also leaked state secrets regarding coal mines to these counter-revolutionary elements.

Zhang Zhonglu has served as a high-ranking official of the Kuomintang. In 1934, he joined the Kuomintang CC Clique and served as the head of the pseudo-Provincial Department of Education and the pseudo-Provincial Department of Construction. While serving as the president of the pseudo-Henan University, he organized a "Mobilization Committee" in the school, mobilizing a large number of students to join the reactionary Youth Army. During the Liberation War, he served as a member of the "Suppression of Rebellion Committee" and had close contact with Chen Lifu, Chen Guofu, Luo Jialun, Jiang Tingfu, and others.

　　章罗联盟在河南的大将
　　张仲鲁的反动行径彻底揭穿
    本报郑州25日电　记者张健虹报道：在民盟河南省委最近连续举行的座谈会上，人们以铁证如山的事实揭发了章罗联盟在河南的大将、省交通厅副厅长张仲鲁的反动面貌。
    人们揭露，今年4月份张仲鲁出席北京民盟全国工作会议时，便和章罗联盟中的骨干张云川、王一帆、杨逸棠等秘密策划在河南发展农工民主党的阴谋。他回省后，又在张云川的文件指示和书信往来中商定发展计划。党开始整风以后，张云川到了河南，并且传达章伯钧的意思说，准备让张仲鲁担任农工民主党河南省组织的负责人，还将调章伯钧的亲信侯瑞桓来给他当助手。张仲鲁和张云川共同确定要在河南发展十万农工党员，发展对象是对党不满的人，首先要把右派分子张静吾、罗绳武吸收进来。
    张仲鲁是个阴险的右派分子。他表面上装作进步，要求入党，在背后却时时对党进行诽谤，并且认为靠近党的人是假积极。
    在大鸣大放期间，张仲鲁表面上不参加鸣放，但在背后对人宣扬储安平的反动言论，又挑拨民主党派和共产党的关系。
    张仲鲁曾担任燃料工业部煤矿总局副局长的职务，当时他以私人关系先后介绍了十一名反革命分子参加局的工作，其中有逮捕过十多名革命同志的国民党修武县党部书记长范承旭。他还曾把煤矿方面的国家机密泄露给这些反革命分子。
    张仲鲁曾历任国民党的高级官员，1934年参加了国民党CC派，担任过伪教育厅长、建设厅长等职务，办过伪中央训练团。在任伪河南大学校长期间，他在学校组织“动员委员会”，动员大批学生参加反动青年军。在解放战争时期，他当过“戡乱委员会”委员，并和陈立夫、陈果夫、罗家伦、蒋廷黻等人往来密切。
