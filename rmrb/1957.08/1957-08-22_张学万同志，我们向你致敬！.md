　　Comrade Zhang Xuewan, We Salute You!
　　Gong Liu
    During the counter-revolutionary riot in Hanyang County, fourteen demobilized soldiers awaiting job assignments consciously stepped forward and persisted in fighting the rioters. Among them, Comrade Zhang Xuewan, who charged through the encirclement to protect the county head from harm, had previously been awarded a third-class merit and wounded on the Korean front. Comrade Zhang Xuewan, we salute you! You gave your sacred blood to Korea, bringing back scars, merits, and hatred for the enemy; you returned to your hometown and remained like a patrolman on the front lines, waiting for a job assignment, like waiting for battle orders. Yes, you are a demobilized soldier wearing faded military uniform, but we know that beneath that faded uniform beats a heart that will never be demobilized! Comrade Zhang Xuewan, we salute you! It was you and your thirteen comrades who discovered the serious enemy situation in these peaceful days, and unmasked the disguised enemies in the bustling city of Hanyang! Your ears are the ears of the class, your eyes are the eyes of the class! What instructed you to stand tall was a clear Party spirit! Wherever there is counter-revolution, there must be resolute struggle! Comrade Zhang Xuewan, we salute you! You used your body to shield the democratically elected county head. In the face of the rioters, your wounded body was a living Shangganling! Defend our democratically elected county head! Defending him is defending every citizen who cast a sacred vote! Defending him is defending our socialist regime! Defending him is defending the revolution that we must always defend! Comrade Zhang Xuewan, we salute you!

　　张学万同志，我们向你致敬！
　　公刘
    在汉阳县反革命暴乱事件中，有十四个正在等待分配工作的复员军人自觉地挺身而出和暴乱分子坚持斗争。其中冲入重围，保护县长免于受害的张学万同志曾经在朝鲜前线立过三等功，负过伤。张学万同志，我们向你致敬！你把自己圣洁的血液留给了朝鲜，带回来伤痕、功勋和对敌人的憎恨；你回到故乡，依然像巡逻在阵地前沿，等待着分配工作，像等待着作战命令，不错，你是一个穿着褪色军装的复员军人，但我们知道，在那褪色的军装下面，跃动着一颗永不复员的心！张学万同志，我们向你致敬！是你和你的十三位战友，在和平的日子里发现了严重的敌情，在汉阳的闹市中识破了化装的敌人！你们的耳朵是阶级的耳朵，你们的眼睛是阶级的眼睛！指使你们挺胸而出的，是鲜明的党性！什么地方有反革命，就在什么地方坚决斗争！张学万同志，我们向你致敬！你用自己的身体掩护着民选的县长，在暴乱分子面前，你的带伤的身体就是一座活的上甘岭！保卫我们民选的县长！保卫他，就是保卫投过神圣一票的每一个公民！保卫他，就是保卫我们的社会主义政权！保卫他，就是保卫我们永远都要保卫的革命！张学万同志，我们向你致敬！
