Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 14th August: Syrian military authorities have uncovered a major conspiracy organized by American spies aimed at overthrowing the current Syrian government. Most of those involved in the conspiracy have been arrested.

The Syrian government issued a statement on the 12th stating that the organizer of this conspiracy was an American named Howard Stone. He had previously orchestrated conspiracies and coups against Sudan, Iran, and Guatemala. After Stone was assigned to arrange the conspiracy against the Syrian government, the American Embassy in Damascus provided him with the necessary staff, cars, houses, and money. He received all information about Syria.

The statement said that the conspirators had previously held a meeting in Beirut, attended by Nasser Jamil (uncle of the King of Jordan), Adib Shishakli (former President of Syria), Ibrahim Husseini (Syrian military attache in Rome), the American military attache in Beirut, and the French ambassador and military attache in Beirut. They discussed how to implement the conspiracy.

The statement pointed out that the conspirators attempted to entice some Syrian officers to participate in their activities. American spy Stone personally led a Syrian officer to the residence of an American Embassy official to meet with Husseini. Husseini told the officer that the United States had promised to provide three to four hundred million dollars in aid if the current Syrian government were overthrown. Husseini also said that his American friends wanted him to assassinate high-ranking Syrian military officers, including Chief of Staff Nizam al-Din.

The statement said that this conspiracy case was uncovered with the help of patriotic Syrian officers. After the conspirators contacted them, these officers reported the American conspiracy to the government. At the same time, under the instructions of the Syrian authorities, they continued to maintain contact with the conspirators in order to know all their secrets and discover their ringleaders as much as possible.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 14th August: The Egyptian Military Tribunal opened the trial of the anti-government conspiracy case on the 12th. The main witness for the prosecution confirmed that the United States participated in the conspiracy.

This conspiracy case was uncovered by the Egyptian government in April this year and announced in mid-July. The conspirators attempted to assassinate President Nasser and all cabinet ministers and establish a pro-American government. They planned to install former President Naguib as president, with Wafd Party member and former minister Salah al-Din as prime minister, and former Egyptian military attache to India, now retired Brigadier General Atif Nasser, as commander-in-chief of the army.

Thirteen army officers and civilians, led by the main culprit Atif Nasser, attended the trial at the Cairo Military Tribunal on August 12, except for one who was absent due to illness.

The main witness, former army officer Ahmed Qadri, said in court that one of the defendants, Istambuli, had told him that the American ambassador to Egypt, Raymond Hare, had tried to contact Salah al-Din and former Prime Minister and Wafd Party member Mustafa Nahas before the tripartite aggression by Britain, France, and Israel against Egypt. Salah al-Din had also gone to Saudi Arabia to meet with people there, attempting to reach an understanding on the measures to be taken during the coup.

Qadri said that Istambuli also told him that Atif Nasser had brought back three pistol silencers used by American intelligence personnel from abroad.

    叙破获美间谍颠复大阴谋案
    阴谋者企图谋杀高级军官推翻叙政府
    埃及的反政府阴谋案证实有美国参预
    据新华社大马士革14日电　叙利亚军事当局破获了一件由美国间谍组织的，企图推翻叙利亚现政府的大阴谋案。参预这个阴谋的大部分人已经被逮捕。
    叙利亚政府12日发表声明说，这个阴谋的组织者是一个名叫霍华德·斯通的美国人。他曾经策划过反对苏丹、伊朗和危地马拉的阴谋和政变。在斯通被指定来安排反对叙利亚政府的阴谋以后，在大马士革的美国大使馆供给了他所需要的职员、汽车、房子和金钱。他得到所有关于叙利亚的情报。
    声明说，阴谋分子事先曾经在贝鲁特举行会议，参加会议的有纳赛尔·贾米勒（约旦国王的叔父）、阿迪布·施舍克里（叙利亚前总统），叙利亚驻罗马武官易卜拉欣·侯赛尼、美国驻贝鲁特武官以及法国驻贝鲁特的大使和武官。他们讨论了如何实现阴谋的问题。
    声明指出，阴谋者企图勾引某些叙利亚军官参预他们的活动。美国间谍斯通曾经亲自引领一个叙利亚军官到美国大使馆官员的住所去同侯赛尼会见。侯赛尼对这个军官说，美国已经答应给予三亿到四亿美元的援助，如果叙利亚现政府被推翻的话。侯赛尼还说，他的美国朋友要他谋杀包括陆军参谋长尼扎姆丁在内的叙利亚高级军官。
    声明说，这个阴谋案是在叙利亚的爱国军官帮助下破获的。这些军官在阴谋者同他们接触以后把美国的阴谋报告了政府，同时，他们在叙利亚当局的指示下继续同阴谋者保持联系，以便知道他们的一切秘密和尽可能地发现他们的头子。
    据新华社开罗14日电　埃及军事法庭12日开庭审理反政府阴谋案。检察当局方面的主要证人证实，美国参预了阴谋。
    这件阴谋案是埃及政府在今年4月间破获然后在7月中旬公布的。阴谋分子企图暗杀纳赛尔总统和所有的内阁部长，成立亲美政府。他们准备拥立前总统纳吉布为总统，由华夫脱党人、前部长萨拉·艾尔丁当总理，由前埃及驻印度武官、现已退休的陆军准将阿蒂夫·纳赛尔当陆军总司令。
    以主犯阿蒂夫·纳赛尔为首的十三名陆军军官和文职人员，除一名因病缺席外，都出席了8月12日开罗军事法庭的审讯。
    主要证人、前陆军军官艾哈迈德·卡德里在法庭上说，被告之一伊斯坦布利曾经告诉他：美国驻埃及大使雷蒙·赫尔在英、法、以色列三国侵略埃及以前，曾经试图同萨拉·艾尔丁和前首相、华夫脱党人穆斯塔法·纳哈斯进行接触。萨拉·艾尔丁还曾经到沙特阿拉伯去会见那里的人们，企图就发动政变时采取的措施取得谅解。
    卡德里说，伊斯坦布利还告诉他，阿蒂夫·纳赛尔曾经从海外带来美国情报人员所用的三个手枪消音器。
