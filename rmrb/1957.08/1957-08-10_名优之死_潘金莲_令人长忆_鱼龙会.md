    "The Death of a Famous Actor," "Pan Jinlian"
    Remind People of the "Fish and Dragon Assembly"
    Counting from the Spring Willow Society, spoken drama in China has developed for a full fifty years. To commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the spoken drama movement, the Beijing People's Art Theatre will stage two famous plays from the Southern China Society's "Fish and Dragon Assembly," "The Death of a Famous Actor" and "Pan Jinlian," starting August 10th.
    The "Southern China Society" was the abbreviated name of the "Southern China Film and Drama Society" which was reorganized and established in 1925, under the leadership of Comrade Tian Han. In 1927, Tian Han organized Shanghai Art University and held a week-long art "Fish and Dragon Assembly," where many famous plays were performed on the "small stage" (a classroom that could accommodate about a hundred people). This played an important role in cultivating talents and promoting theoretical discussions in the spoken drama movement. At that time, spoken drama actors performed on the same stage as traditional opera actors, and often held literary and artistic seminars to debate the "merits and demerits of new and old dramas" and the development of "new spoken drama and old spoken drama" (civilized drama). After Tian Han stopped running the Art University, he led the Southern China Society to tour and perform in Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, and other places. It was forced to disband due to persecution by the Kuomintang reactionary rule, and later reorganized a drama troupe to continue the struggle. The Beijing People's Art Theatre's choice to perform these two famous plays has great historical commemorative significance.
    "The Death of a Famous Actor" is a loud roar from Tian Han, breaking away from romanticism and using realism to address the old society. The author uses a simple and unadorned style, rigorous layout, and concise language to realistically shape the characters. On the question of whether artistic victory or victory of money and power prevails, it vividly reveals the tragic fate of corruption and strangulation of art and artists by decadent forces, powerfully criticizing the old society and warning artists to be wary of the malicious "flattery" of the gentry.
    "Pan Jinlian" is a five-act costume drama written by Ouyang Yuqian, a veteran playwright who has been active since the Spring Willow Society, using a new historical perspective. When it was performed at the "Fish and Dragon Assembly," the author played Pan Jinlian, and Zhou Xinfang played Wu Song. After the performance, the painter Xu Beihong commented: "It overturns the old case of hundreds of years, and reveals the hidden feelings of beauty. It is affectionate and reasonable, magnificent and exhilarating. It is worthy of being a masterpiece." (Dong Qing)

### “名优之死”“潘金莲”  令人长忆“鱼龙会”

    “名优之死”“潘金莲”
    令人长忆“鱼龙会”
    自春柳社算起，话剧在中国发展已整五十年了。为纪念话剧运动五十年，北京人民艺术剧院8月10日起演出南国社“鱼龙会”上“名优之死”和“潘金莲”两个名剧。
    “南国社”是1925年田汉同志主持的“南国电影剧社”改组成立而简称“南国社”。1927年田汉主办上海艺术大学，开了一星期艺术“鱼龙会”，在“小舞台”（可容百人左右的教室）上演出了不少名剧，于话剧运动培养人才和理论探讨，都起着重要的推动作用。当时话剧演员同戏曲演员同台演出，并常以文艺座谈会方式对“新、旧剧之得失”和“新话剧与旧话剧”（文明戏）的发展展开争论。田汉停办艺大后领导南国社在上海、南京、杭州、广州等地巡回演出，因国民党反动统治迫害而被迫解散，后另组剧社继续奋斗。北京人艺选择这两出名剧演出，是富有极大的历史纪念意义的。
    “名优之死”是田汉摆脱浪漫主义，以现实主义向旧社会发出的一声巨响。作者以单纯朴素的风格、严谨的布局和精练的语言，真实的塑造了人物性格，而在艺术胜利还是金钱与势力胜利的问题上，形象地揭示出腐朽势力于艺术和艺人腐蚀和扼杀的悲剧命运，有力的抨击了旧社会，正告艺人们对恶毒“捧场”的劣绅以警惕。
    “潘金莲”是自春柳社起五十年如一日的老戏剧家欧阳予倩，以新的历史观点所写的五幕古装话剧。在“鱼龙会”上演出时作者扮演潘金莲，周信芳扮演武松，演后画家徐悲鸿评谓：“翻数百年之陈案，揭美人之隐衷。入情入理，壮快淋漓。不愧杰作”。　（冬青）
