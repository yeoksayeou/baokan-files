　　Special dispatch from our newspaper and Xinhua News Agency, Harbin: The Heilongjiang and Harbin People's Broadcasting Stations recently launched a struggle against rightists Lu Mang and Chen Rui.

　　Lu Mang is a Communist Party member and currently the deputy director of the Literature and Art Department of the Heilongjiang Broadcasting Station. Chen Rui is a member of the Communist Youth League and the deputy leader of the Political Education Group of the Harbin Municipal Broadcasting Station. They insisted on bourgeois journalistic viewpoints, engaged in small group activities, and attempted to usurp the Party's leadership over the provincial and municipal radio stations. When Lu and Chen were concurrently in leadership positions at the municipal station, they once tampered with the political direction of the municipal station.

　　Lu Mang and Chen Rui also put forward the slogan of "relentless exposure" to incite the masses to attack the Party. For example, last year, when streetcars and buses in Harbin were crowded and some disputes occurred between passengers and conductors, Chen Rui organized bus conductors on the radio to complain to society, attempting to incite the masses' dissatisfaction with the Communist Party.

　　Lu Mang and Chen Rui were very hostile to the new society. They decided to produce a special radio program of essays and short pieces called "Bao Gong's Private Visits" in the second half of this year, specializing in exposing so-called "dark sides." Lu Mang and Chen Rui also planned to set up listener reception rooms on busy streets, with hidden tape recorders in the reception rooms to "record the impassioned words of certain visitors and broadcast them."

　　During the period of great blooming and contending, Lu Mang and Chen Rui believed that the time had come. They advocated broadcasting the full text of all rightist remarks and insisted on recording and publishing rightist remarks during interviews.

　　While implementing the bourgeois direction in the broadcasting station, rightists Lu Mang and Chen Rui also took various measures to conspire to seize leadership. During the blooming and contending, they attacked the provincial Party committee leaders on the one hand, and secretly carried out so-called "cabinet forming" activities on the other hand. They also drafted a list of leadership cadres for the radio station, preparing to have everyone sign it, and then ask the provincial Party committee to follow suit.

    不准右派分子篡夺人民电台的领导
    鲁莽陈锐“组阁”活动垮台
    本报特约新华社哈尔滨讯　黑龙江和哈尔滨人民广播电台最近向右派分子鲁莽、陈锐展开了斗争。
    鲁莽是共产党员，现任黑龙江广播电台文艺部副部长。陈锐是共青团员，哈尔滨市广播电台政教组副组长。他们坚持资产阶级的新闻观点，进行小集团活动，企图篡夺党对省、市电台的领导权。当鲁、陈同时在市电台担任领导工作期间，一度篡改了市台的政治方向。
    鲁莽和陈锐还提出“要无情的揭露”的口号，煽动群众向党进攻。如去年正当哈尔滨市电车、汽车拥挤，乘客和乘务员发生一些纠纷时，陈锐就在广播中组织了汽车乘务员向社会诉苦，企图以此来煽动群众对共产党不满。
    鲁莽和陈锐十分仇视新社会，他们曾决定要在今年下半年办一个杂文、小品文的专题广播节目，定名为“包公私访”，专门揭发所谓“黑暗面”。鲁莽、陈锐还计划在繁华的街头设立一些听众接待室，在接待室设置隐蔽的录音机，以便把某些来访者的“激愤的语言记录下来广播出去”。
    在大鸣大放期间，鲁莽、陈锐认为时机已到，凡是右派分子的言论他们都主张全文照播，并且在采访中对右派言论有闻必录，坚持发表。
    右派分子鲁莽、陈锐在广播电台贯彻资产阶级方向的同时，还采取各种办法阴谋窃取领导权。他们在鸣放中一面向省委领导进行攻击，一面在暗地里进行所谓“组阁”活动，对电台的领导干部安排，也拟定了名单，准备让大家签名，然后再要省委照办。
