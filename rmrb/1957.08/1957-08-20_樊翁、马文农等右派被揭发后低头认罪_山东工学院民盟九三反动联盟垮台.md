Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 19th: From mid-July to mid-August, Shandong Institute of Technology held a series of meetings to expose and criticize the counter-revolutionary alliance formed by the "China Democratic League" and "Jiusan Society" organizations within the institute, which were controlled by a small number of rightist elements. Now, the backbone of this counter-revolutionary alliance, Fan Weng, director of the China Democratic League's Shandong Institute of Technology branch, Ma Wennong, the organization committee member, Guan Tingdong, who considered himself the "founding father" of the China Democratic League organization at the institute, and Cui Hongzhang and Jiang Renyuan, the director and deputy director of the Jiusan Society's Shandong Institute of Technology branch, and other rightist elements, have, in the face of a large number of facts exposed by the masses, surrendered and begun to bow their heads in confession to the people.

These rightist elements were all professors and associate professors at Shandong Institute of Technology. During the period of the Great Blooming and Contending, they formed an alliance to launch a major attack on the Communist Party. Fan Weng served as the "commander-in-chief" of this counter-revolutionary alliance, Cui Hongzhang served as the "deputy commander," and Ma, Guan, Jiang, and others served as "strategists" and "generals" within this alliance. Guan Tingdong was originally studying at Tsinghua University in Beijing, but in early June he returned to Shandong early specifically to participate in anti-Party activities. While in Beijing, he also wrote a letter to "Guangming Daily," requesting that a reporter be sent to Shandong Institute of Technology to "interview the blooming and contending situation."

The general program of this counter-revolutionary alliance was to negate the achievements of the Three-Anti and ideological remolding movements and the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries campaign, to negate the socialist road, and to drive the Communist Party out of institutions of higher learning. The strategy they adopted was to make Communist Party members and activists stink and discredit them, thereby reducing the Party's prestige and weakening its combat effectiveness. They also put forward the reactionary slogan of "to catch the bandits, first catch the king" against the Communist Party.

Under this counter-revolutionary program, they began a series of coordinated reactionary activities. In the early stage of the "blooming and contending," when the "China Democratic League" posted a big-character poster aimed at negating the achievements of the Three-Anti and Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries movements and vilifying the Party's "four suggestions," the "Jiusan Society" posted a big-character poster expressing enthusiastic support and endorsement. After the "Jiusan Society" posted anti-Party big-character posters distorting and slandering the Three-Anti and ideological remolding movements and demanding the removal of the chairman of the trade union, the "China Democratic League" immediately issued big-character posters in response. They also held six consecutive "symposiums on the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionaries" (initially called "symposiums on reversing verdicts"), in which they wantonly slandered and attacked the Communist Party. Cui Hongzhang said that the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries campaign at Shandong Institute of Technology was "randomly pairing up people." Chen Shouzhu, Cui Hongzhang's "gunner," vilified the leaders and activists in the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries campaign as "unreasonable, ignorant, lawless, incompetent, and individually shameless." This symposium was hosted in rotation by Fan Weng and Cui Hongzhang, and the rightist elements within this anti-Party alliance secretly organized the targets of the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries campaign (even including the family members of the targets) to "air their grievances" at the meeting in order to incite people's hearts and attack the Party. In the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries campaign, the rightist element Guan Tingdong was not struggled against, but at the symposium he also portrayed himself as a "struggled against person" and tried his best to attack and slander the Communist Party. After these rightist elements viciously slandered the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries campaign at the meeting, they demanded that the Party committee "reverse the verdicts" based on the opinions of the rightist elements.

This rightist counter-revolutionary alliance then released some poisonous arrows on the issue of school leadership. Fan Weng said: "The system of Party committee leadership is contradictory to the principle of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision." He suggested that unqualified Party member leading cadres could become "cooks." Guan Tingdong said: "Professors should play a decision-making role in the school and play a leading role above the Party committee." The rightist elements of this counter-revolutionary alliance even specifically determined who would hold leadership positions after the Communist Party withdrew from the school. They once wanted to drive away the current vice-president and Party committee secretary, Ding Zongyue, and have Fan Weng serve as vice-president; after removing the Party members in the deans' office, three rightist elements from the "China Democratic League" and "Jiusan Society" would serve as deans and vice-deans, respectively; they even selected candidates for the chairman of the trade union. In June and July, they also used the dissatisfaction of some students with the academic system to instigate students to make trouble, attempting to create a "Hungarian incident" at Shandong Institute of Technology.

In order to realize these conspiracies, Fan Weng, Ma Wennong, and others faithfully implemented Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji's instructions on "recruiting soldiers and buying horses," actively developing the organization. At the same time, they attacked progressive forces within the China Democratic League, attempting to turn the China Democratic League branch into a purely rightist organization.

### 樊翁、马文农等右派被揭发后低头认罪  山东工学院民盟九三反动联盟垮台

    樊翁、马文农等右派被揭发后低头认罪
    山东工学院民盟九三反动联盟垮台
    新华社济南19日电　山东工学院从7月中旬到8月中旬曾连续举行多次会议，对学院中的“民盟”、“九三”两个组织在少数右派分子操纵下结成的反动联盟进行了揭露和批判。现在，这个反动联盟的骨干、民盟山东工学院支部主任委员樊翁，组织委员马文农和以工学院民盟组织“开国元勋”自居的关廷栋以及九三学社山东工学院支社正副主任委员崔鸿章、蒋仁渊等右派分子在群众揭发的大量事实面前，已纷纷缴械投降，开始向人民低头认罪。
    这些右派分子都是山东工学院的教授和副教授，大鸣大放期间，他们结成联盟向共产党大举进攻。樊翁担任了这个反动联盟的“主帅”，崔鸿章担任了“次帅”，马、关、蒋等人分任这个联盟内的“军师”和“大将”。关廷栋本来在北京清华大学进修，6月上旬他却提前回了山东专门来参加反党活动。在北京时，他还写了信给“光明日报”，要求派记者到山东工学院“采访鸣放情况”。
    这个反动联盟的总纲领是：否定三反、思想改造和肃反运动的成绩，否定社会主义的道路，把共产党赶出高等学校。他们采取的策略就是要把共产党员和积极分子搞臭、骂臭，从而降低党的威信，削弱党的战斗力。他们还提出了对共产党要“擒贼先擒王”的反动口号。
    在这个反动纲领之下，他们开始进行了一系列的互相配合的反动活动。“鸣放”初期，当“民盟”贴出目的在于否定三反、肃反等运动成绩和丑化党的“四点建议”的大字报以后，“九三”便贴出大字报表示热烈支持和拥护。“九三”贴出歪曲和污蔑三反、思想改造运动和要撤掉工会主席的反党大字报后，“民盟”也立即出大字报响应。他们还连续召开了六次“肃反问题座谈会”（起初叫“平反座谈会”），对共产党大肆污蔑和攻击。崔鸿章说山东工学院的肃反运动是“乱点鸳鸯谱”。崔鸿章的“炮手”陈寿祖污蔑肃反中的领导和积极分子是“无理、无知、无法、无能，个别的无耻”。这个座谈会分别由樊翁、崔鸿章轮流主持，并由这个反党联盟内的右派分子秘密组织肃反对象（甚至连肃反对象的家属也包括在内）在会上“诉苦”，来煽惑人心，向党进攻。在肃反运动中，右派分子关廷栋并没有被斗，可是他在座谈会上也把自己扮演成“被斗者”，对共产党极力加以攻击和污蔑。这些右派分子在会上对肃反运动进行恶毒的污蔑之后，便要党委根据右派分子的意见“平反”。
    这个右派反动联盟接着又在学校的领导问题上放出一些毒箭。樊翁说：“党委负责制与长期共存、互相监督的方针有矛盾”，他提出党员领导干部不称职的可以当“炊事员”。关廷栋说：“教授在学校中应当起决策作用，在党委之上起领导作用。”这个反动联盟的右派分子，甚至把共产党退出学校后谁担任领导职务都具体确定了。他们曾想把现任副院长、党委书记丁宗岳赶走，由樊翁任副院长；将教务长中的党员赶下台后，由“民盟”和“九三”的三个右派分子分别担任教务长和副教务长；甚至连工会主席的人选也物色好了。6、7月间，他们还利用部分学生在学制问题上的不满情绪，煽动学生闹事，企图在山东工学院搞一个“匈牙利事件”。
    为了实现这些阴谋，樊翁、马文农等忠实执行了章伯钧、罗隆基关于“招兵买马”的指示，积极发展组织。同时在民盟内部打击进步力量，企图把民盟支部搞成清一色的右派。
