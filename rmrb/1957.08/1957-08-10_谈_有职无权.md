On "Having a Title Without Authority"
Jue Zai

Undertaking a certain "title" requires being responsible and fulfilling the duties, and requires having a certain "authority" to be responsible and fulfill the duties. Title, responsibility, and authority are closely linked and inseparable.

It is unimaginable to give someone a title but not the authority to fulfill the duties. The vast majority of staff in our national and economic institutions, whether they are Communist Party members or non-Communist Party members, are dedicated to their duties. They work diligently, learn honestly, and rely on them to complete the socialist transformation of the country in a short period of time, achieve great victories in socialist construction, and steadily advance towards the road of eliminating exploitation and poverty and building a prosperous and happy society. Among them—the very dedicated or generally dedicated Communist Party members and non-Communist Party members—in work discussions and work inspections, most feel that the cause is fresh, the tasks are heavy, their knowledge is insufficient, their experience is insufficient, or their time is insufficient, so that they often inevitably make shortcomings and mistakes, but no one feels that their authority is insufficient. Although some people complain that their work has not received strong cooperation from relevant parties, or that their opinions have not received strong support from certain leaders, these are issues of mutual research and mutual adjustment in work that require some effort and time, rather than issues related to the authority of staff members in their positions.

There are some people who are passive and loaf on the job, not doing what they should do, not managing what they should manage, and not using the authority they have; and there are also some people who "start barking as soon as they get off the car," not understanding and analyzing the reality, and only issuing orders based on their position, resulting in bad outcomes. Both are dereliction of duty. Not exercising authority and乱exercising authority are not related to whether or not one has authority.

The phenomenon of "having a title without authority" should not exist. However, it does exist in some non-Party staff members. That is because the Party organizations of some institutions are not good at soliciting the opinions of non-Party staff members, especially the opinions of non-Party members who are responsible, and studying and adopting them; they are not good at helping non-Party members understand the Party's policies, and have not gone through them for what should be implemented through them. In this way, people feel that non-Party members are just for show, having a title without authority. This is one aspect. On the other hand, individual non-Party members have a guest mentality, unwilling to delve deeply into their work. When work comes, they cannot offer solutions or offer very superficial solutions, and they cannot exercise their authority. If you do not exercise it, someone else must exercise it on your behalf. Therefore, on the surface, it seems like there is no authority.

This phenomenon must be corrected. The Party must help non-Party members improve themselves in the practice of their work and increase their enthusiasm for being responsible and fulfilling their duties; those who do not respect the status of non-Party members and their legitimate opinions must be given education and criticism. Similarly, non-Party staff members must also regard themselves as masters of the country, be responsible and fulfill their duties, and fight against anyone who obstructs them from being responsible and fulfilling their duties. Where the title is, there the authority is. The phenomenon of having no authority will disappear.

It should be pointed out that the "having a title without authority" clamored by certain rightist backbone elements is because they do not regard "authority" as a way to do a good job, but as a tool for individuals to act like tyrants. For example, they demand unrestricted power in hiring and using money, which we cannot allow. The head of an institution has the right to choose your assistants, such as ministers and bureau directors recommending someone to be a division chief, section chief, or other people, but it must go through the review of the personnel department and certain appointment procedures. Similarly, the person in charge has the right to review and supervise the income and expenditure of administrative and business funds of the institution, but it must comply with the financial system and go through certain review procedures. Relying on a note from the head to hire or fire someone, or relying on a note to withdraw a certain amount of money or reimburse a certain item, is the style of the Kuomintang, which we have long eradicated. In our country, there is no phenomenon of "using people based on personal connections," where A comes with a set of people and B comes and changes another set of people; there is no phenomenon of abuse of public funds. Is this not good?

On this matter—using people and using money—the Party's requirements for Party members are strict. No matter what position you hold, if you violate the system and hire someone for personal reasons, you will be criticized or even punished; if you violate the system and misuse money, you will have to compensate and even be punished. If this is also called authority, then Communist Party members have less authority than non-Party members, not more.

We must pay attention to eliminating some abnormal phenomena of having a title without authority, and more importantly, we must pay attention to the fact that some rightist elements are not fulfilling their duties but are using the excuse of having a title without authority to attack the Party, attempting to undermine the country's solemn administrative system and restore the Kuomintang's style, and must be given a forceful and irreconcilable rebuke.

### 谈“有职无权”

    谈“有职无权”
    觉哉
    担负了一定的“职”，就要负责尽职，就要有负责尽职的一定行为的“权”。职、责、权，三者是紧密相联不可分的。
    给人以职，却不给人以尽职的权，是难以想像的事。我们国家机关和经济机关的工作人员，不论是共产党人或非共产党人，绝大部分是尽职的。他们勤勤恳恳地做，老老实实地学，依靠他们，在短短的几年间完成了全国社会主义的改造，取得了社会主义建设的很大胜利，稳步的向消灭剥削和贫困、建立繁荣幸福社会的大路前进。在他们中间——很尽职的或一般尽职的共产党员和非共产党员中间，在工作讨论上、工作检查上，大都感到事业新鲜、任务繁重、学识不够用、经验不够用或者时间不够用，以致常不免发生缺点和错误，但没见有人感到权力不够用。虽然也有人埋怨他的工作没有得到有关方面有力的配合，或者他的意见，没有得到某些领导者的有力支持，但这些，是工作上相互研究、相互调整、需要费些力量与时间的问题，而不是关于工作人员职务上的权的问题。
    有一种人，消极怠工，应做的事不做、应管的事不管，有权不使用；又有一种人，“下车伊始，哇喇哇喇”，不去了解与分析实际，仅凭自己的地位，乱发命令，结果把事情办坏。二者都是失职。不行使权与乱行使权，更不是与有权与否相关的事。
    “有职无权”的现象，是不应该有的。但是，在某些非党的工作人员身上又确实存在着。那是某些机构的党组织不善于征求非党工作人员的意见，尤其是负一定责任的非党人员的意见，加以研究和采纳；不善于帮助非党人员使之了解党的政策，应该经过他们去实施的没有经过他们。这样，使人感到非党人士是摆样的，有职无权。这是一方面。另一方面，个别的非党人员，有作客思想，不肯深入地钻研业务，工作来了，提不出办法或提得很肤浅，有权不能行使。你不行使，必得有人代为行使。因而表面看来，像是无权。
    必须纠正这种现象，党要帮助非党人士使他在工作的实践中提高自己、提高其负责尽职的积极性；对于不尊重非党人士的地位及其正当意见的人须给以教育和批评。同样，非党的工作人员也必须以国家主人翁自居，尽责尽职，有阻碍其尽责尽职的，就和他斗争。职的所在，即权的所在。无权的现象也就会没有了。
    应该指出某些右派骨干分子所叫嚣的“有职无权”，他们是不把“权”看做是办好“职”的方法，而把“权”看做是个人作威作福的工具。比如他们要求有不受限制的用人权与用钱权等，这是我们不能容许的。一个机构的负责人有权选择你的助手，如部长局长要推荐某人当司长科长或其他的人等，但必须经过人事机构的审查，经过一定的任命手续。同样负责人有权审查监督本机构的行政经费和事业经费的收支，但必须符合财政制度，经过一定的审核程序。凭首长一个条子，就可以把某人用进或把某人辞退；凭一个条子就可以提取多少款子或报销某项用项，这是国民党的作风，我们早已把它根绝了。我们国家里没有“用人唯私”、甲来带一套人马、乙来又换一套人马的现象；没有滥用公款的现象。这难道是不好的吗？
    在这上面——用人和用钱上面党对党员的要求是严格的。不管你担负什么职务，违反制度任用了私人要挨批评甚至处分，违反制度乱用了钱要赔偿以至处分。如果也叫做权的话，那共产党人不比非党人员多而是比非党人员少。
    要注意消灭某些有职无权的不正常的现象，更要注意的是某些右派分子自己不尽职却假借有职无权的话向党进行攻击，企图破坏国家严肃的行政制度，恢复国民党的作风，必须给以有力的不可调和的斥责。
