    Hate Atomic War!
    British Family of Five Commits Suicide
    Xinhua News Agency, London, 16th—As the British government persists in opposing the immediate prohibition of atomic weapons, a British family of five committed suicide out of fear of the disaster of atomic war.
    Mr. and Mrs. Andrew Marshall of Blackpool gassed their three daughters to death last week, and then the couple tied themselves together and committed suicide by throwing themselves into the sea. In a suicide note sent to her mother, Mrs. Marshall said that they did this because they did not want the disaster of a new atomic war to befall their children. She said that she and her husband felt hatred at the thought of their children having to face everything that other children had faced in the last world war.
    This family of five was buried together in a tomb yesterday. But the hydrogen bombs they hated still await being sent to the tomb by the people.

    憎恨原子战争！
    英国一家五口自杀
    据新华社16日讯  伦敦消息：在英国政府坚持反对立即禁止原子武器的时候，一个五口人的英国家庭由于害怕原子战争的灾难而全家自杀了。
    布拉克浦的安德鲁·马歇尔夫妇在上星期用煤气熏死了他们的三个女儿，然后夫妇俩把自己捆在一起投海自杀。马歇尔太太在寄给她的母亲的绝命书中说，他们之所以这样作，是因为他们不愿让新的原子战争的灾难降临到他们的孩子的身上。她说，她和她的丈夫一想到他们的孩子将来不得不面临别的孩子们在上次世界大战中所面临的一切，他们就感到憎恨。
    这一家五口已经在昨天合葬在一个墓穴里。但是他们所憎恨的氢弹还有待于人们把它们送入墓穴。
