The Egyptian Basketball Team Holds Third Game
    Beijing Team Wins 88-66

    (Our Dispatch) The Egyptian basketball team played its third friendly match in China against the Beijing team at the Beijing Gymnasium on the evening of the 23rd, losing to the Beijing team by a score of 66-88. Premier Zhou, Vice Premier He Long, and Egyptian Ambassador Ragab and his wife watched this exciting match. After the match, they met with the athletes from both sides and took pictures with them.

    The Beijing team began by using a combination of zone defense and man-to-man marking tactics. Center Ju Fenkan guarded the opposing center, El, while the other four players formed a square to protect the basket. The visiting team used man-to-man marking tactics. At the start of the game, the Egyptian team played more successfully. Forward Raymond and guard George repeatedly grabbed rebounds and intercepted passes, scoring layups in the chaos. Meanwhile, Beijing team guard Zhang Guanglie twice grabbed rebounds but had the ball snatched from his hands and scored into the basket. In less than five minutes, the visiting team led 13-7. At this point, the Beijing team stabilized its position and slowly caught up with cautious passing and mid-range shots. Wang Lifa scored two out of two shots, and Zhang Guanglie made a fast layup, drawing a foul and making both free throws to tie the score at 13. Soon after, Ju Fenkan jumped up and shot, and Zhang Guanglie tipped the ball into the basket, giving the home team a 25-17 lead. The audience cheered for the visiting team. In the applause, Egyptian forward Raymond launched continuous successful attacks, narrowing the gap to 21-25. At this point, the visiting team replaced center El with Shami, who posed a great threat under the basket, in an attempt to catch up using center tactics. However, the home team's defense in surrounding the center was very successful. Wang Lifa, Zhang Xishan, and Qian Chenghai did not give him a chance to receive passes from the outside. In attack, the home team excellently used spread-out tactics, pulling apart the visiting team's defense in the restricted area, allowing Yang Boyong, Qian Chenghai, and others to cut in and shoot. The home team led 43-35 at halftime.

    In the second half, the visiting team immediately supplied the ball to center Shami, who forcibly jumped up and shot under the basket, drawing a foul. Soon after, relying on Shami's continuous shooting and free throws, and guard Ali's steals and long shots, the visiting team narrowed the gap to 43-49. After Raymond's tip-in and several fast aerial passes, Ahmed scored on a fast break, bringing the Egyptian team to 48-51, only three points behind.

    At this point, the home team called a timeout and replaced Bai Jinshen and Wang Yicheng with Yang Boyong and He Shisun, launching fast breaks while also closely marking Shami and Raymond in defense. Qian Chenghai and Yang Boyong repeatedly scored with jump shots and fast cuts, and soon the home team led 66-55. At this point, both sides launched fast attacks. The beautiful actions of both teams in stealing the ball and swatting away the opponent's layup attempts won constant applause from the audience. The home team played more and more actively, and fast breaks and mid-range shots were easy for them. Finally, they won 88-66.

    The Egyptian basketball team left Beijing yesterday for a match in Tianjin. After playing two games in Tianjin, they will visit and compete in Shenyang, Shanghai, and other places.

　　埃及篮球队举行第三场比赛
    北京队以八十八比六十六获胜
    本报讯　埃及篮球队23日晚上在北京体育馆对北京队进行来我国后的第三场友谊比赛，以六十六比八十八败给北京队。周总理、贺龙副总理和埃及大使拉加卜及夫人观看了这场精彩比赛，并在比赛完毕后接见了双方运动员，和运动员们一起照相留念。
    北京队一开始便采用了区域联防和人盯人结合的战术。由中锋长人鞠汾康看住对方中锋爱尔，其余四人站成正方形保护篮下，客队则采用了人盯人的战术。开赛后埃及队打得较成功，前锋瑞蒙德、后卫乔治几次抢得篮下球和截断对方传球，在乱军中上篮得分，而北京队后卫张光烈两次抢得篮下球后被人将球从手中夺去，投入篮中得分。不到五分钟，客队便以十三比七领先。这时北京队稳住了阵脚，以谨慎的传球、中距离投篮慢慢赶上，王利发两投两中，张光烈快速上篮、造成对方犯规后两罚两中追成十三平。不久，鞠汾康跳起投篮，张光烈的篮下拍入，使主队反以二十五比十七超出。观众齐为客队鼓掌，客队前锋瑞蒙德在掌声中接连偷袭成功，赶成二十一比二十五。这时客队以具有很大的篮下威胁的沙米换下中锋爱尔，企图通过中锋战术将比分赶上，但主队包围中锋的防守很成功，王利发、张锡山、钱澄海三人不给他接外围转来的球的机会。在进攻时，主队出色地使用了拉开战术，将客队的禁区的防守拉开后，由杨伯镛、钱澄海等切入投篮，上半时主队以四十三比三十五占先。
    下半时，客队一开始便将球供给中锋沙米，由沙米在篮下强行跳起投篮，造成对方犯规，不久，客队依靠沙米的连投带罚和后卫阿里的偷袭、远投，追成四十三比四十九。瑞蒙德的篮下拍入和几次快速的空中传球后，由阿赫默德快攻投入，使埃及队追成了四十八比五十一，仅差三分。
    这时，主队叫停，以杨伯镛、何诗荪替下白金申、王忆诚，展开了快攻，同时在防守时又紧盯住沙米和瑞蒙德。钱澄海、杨伯镛跳起投篮和快速切入屡屡得分，一会儿主队便以六十六比五十五超出。这时双方都展开了快速进攻，双方队员的断球和拍掉对方上篮时的球的漂亮动作，博得了观众不断的掌声。主队打来越发活跃，快攻、中距离投篮得心应手，最后以八十八比六十六取胜。
    埃及篮球队已于昨日离京去天津比赛，在津比赛两场后将去沈阳、上海等地访问比赛。
