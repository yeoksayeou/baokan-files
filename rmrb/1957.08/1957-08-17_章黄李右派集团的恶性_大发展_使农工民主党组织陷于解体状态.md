Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party (CPWDP) organization, in the anti-Rightist struggle, has exposed a large number of rightists. The organizational composition is extremely complex, and the entire CPWDP organization is in a state of severe paralysis and disintegration. This situation was directly caused by the Zhang Bojun - Huang Qixiang - Li Boqiu rightist clique and its followers who controlled the CPWDP Central Committee and implemented an evil "great expansion" policy.
Joining the CPWDP is Easier Than Buying a Movie Ticket
In Tianjin, some people said that joining the CPWDP was easier than buying a movie ticket. Judging from the actual situation in various places, this statement is not an exaggeration. The situation in some places is even more serious. Li Shihao, the chairman of the CPWDP Zhejiang Provincial Committee and a key rightist element, ambitiously planned to develop 7,000 members in the province. To this end, he adopted various despicable methods such as "pulling," "deceiving," "snatching," and "digging" to recruit people everywhere. In order to develop a historical counter-revolutionary element, Li Shihao personally delivered the "application form for joining the party" to his door, and he served as the recommender himself. Li Shuzhong, the chairman of the CPWDP Fujian Provincial Committee, even used his sister as bait to lure others to join the CPWDP.

The CPWDP's organizational line formulated by the Zhang-Huang-Li rightist clique completely violated the CPWDP's organizational principles of focusing on the medical and health community, using progressive elements as the backbone, and developing a group of representative figures from the middle and upper classes. Zhang Bojun repeatedly proposed to "break down the defense zone system" (that is, each democratic party has a focus of division of labor), and said that "old, young, and backward elements can be developed." The CPWDP originally only stipulated development in large and medium-sized cities, but now it has developed to small cities, counties, and districts. Originally, the focus was on the medical and health community, but now it has developed to all walks of life. Among the development targets, there are people who have been sentenced, people who have completed labor reform, corrupt elements, and even special agents who had participated in the "Military Statistics Bureau" and "Central Statistics Bureau" in the past. In short, anyone who is dissatisfied with the Communist Party and hates the Party has been brought into the CPWDP.

In July last year, the Chinese Medical Association, the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association, the Chinese Physiological Society, the Chinese Microbiological Society, and the Chinese Anatomical Society jointly held a national member representative conference in Beijing. After secret consultations, Zhang Bojun, Huang Qixiang, and Li Boqiu held a large banquet at the Beijing Hotel, trying to win over those who came to Beijing for the conference to expand their influence and develop organizations when they returned. At that time, more than 500 people were invited. After the "banquet," they sent the list of these invited people to various places, instructing local organizations to contact these people. As a result, CPWDP organizations in various places "followed the example from above," and held large-scale "banquets" and "receptions" to recruit people.

Then, in August last year, the Organization Department of the CPWDP Central Committee issued instructions to organizations at all levels, criticizing the development in various places for having "conservative thinking," being "small-handed and small-footed," and "overly focused on practicing doctors and traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, failing to further expand the contact work," urging various places to "mobilize all forces" to develop organizations. The slogan put forward by the CPWDP Central Organization Department at this time was "cast a wide net," and not to use a single line to "fish." Zhang Bojun also sent his general, Zhong Dai, Deputy Minister of the CPWDP Central Organization Department, to Tianjin to create "advanced experience." Zhong Dai returned from Tianjin boasting that he had developed more than 100 people (actually only more than 20 people), while Zhang Bojun doubled it, boasting: "Zhong Dai has developed from the original 13 people to more than 200 people in Tianjin. This working experience should be promoted throughout the CPWDP." He also asked Zhong Dai to introduce his experience to the Beijing Municipal Organization.

At the end of last year, Zhang Bojun proposed to establish institutions in major cities across the country. Wherever other democratic parties have not developed, the CPWDP "should go to establish institutions, develop organizations, and occupy positions." Zhang Bojun proposed that the CPWDP should develop 800,000 members. He also wanted Li Boqiu to develop 10,000 members in Beijing.
Sent Six Armies to Recruit Troops and Buy Horses Everywhere
By the time of the Great Blooming and Letting period this year, these rightists had become fanatical about developing organizations. Zhang Bojun sent six armies to recruit troops and buy horses everywhere: Wang Yifan to the Northeast; Yang Yitang to Shandong; Zhang Yunchuan to Henan; Han Zhao'e to Shaanxi; Zhong Dai to Taiyuan, Shijiazhuang, and Baoding; Guo Zhongheng to Kunming.

These rightists recruited and deceived people everywhere, using various means to pull people into the Party. Wang Yifan spent more than 1,900 yuan in the Northeast holding banquets, and he said to the development targets: "You are approved by the United Front Work Department to participate; we are preparing for you to be a member of the provincial preparatory committee, a minister of our provincial committee, equivalent to a department-level cadre in the government." When Yang Yitang assigned development tasks in Shandong, he said: Development "can disregard conditions and political impact." When Zhang Yunchuan developed the organization in Henan, he said that the CPWDP should not absorb "fake activists" who reported to the Party.

In local organizations, the tricks of rightists to develop organizations were even more bizarre. The CPWDP organization in Jinan deceived those who hoped to join the CCP organization by saying: "The CCP will not develop within two years. After you join the CPWDP, we can transfer you to the Communist Party." The CPWDP Wuhan Municipal Organization implemented the so-called "three guarantees" policy, that is, requiring each member to simultaneously contact one, cultivate one, and develop one. Rightists in Fujian Province promoted everywhere, "Without participating in democratic parties, it is not easy to be a member of the CPPCC or a member of the People's Committee." Huang Zhen, Deputy Chairman of the CPWDP Fujian Provincial Committee, distributed more than 50 application forms in one day and one night when developing in Putian County.

The development methods of the Tianjin CPWDP organization, which Zhang Bojun praised endlessly, were extremely despicable. They said to those who were dissatisfied with the Party: "After joining the CPWDP, you will not be bullied by the Communist Party"; to those who were investigated in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries: "Joining the CPWDP can help you get your name cleared"; to those historical counter-revolutionary elements: "Joining the CPWDP can help you draw a conclusion." For some people who wanted to make progress and join the Communist Party, they used sweet words to win them over, saying: "The CPWDP is the same as the Communist Party, and will coexist for a long time in the future." Their steps for development were to find a good "base," draw up a list, and then invite guests or visit them door-to-door, distribute application forms widely, and register them in the roster. The person in charge of the CPWDP branch of Tianjin Xinhua Hospital openly said to the development targets: "Whether you want to participate or not, you have to participate." They even forced them to fill out forms and join the organization while they were sick. When Li Wenhao of Tianjin Railway Central Hospital recruited You Guizhen, director of the nutrition department, he said directly: "Fill out the form, our branch has already approved your application to join the party." Then he asked her to attend the CPWDP branch meeting. In order to expand his power so that he could "have the strength to call upon people," Li Shihao of Zhejiang commanded his cronies and staff to infiltrate every corner, including economic departments, state organs, medical and health circles, literary and art circles, youth, women, and people from all walks of life. At the same time, he also tried several times to send people to Qingtian County and Dongyang County to develop handicraft workers. In this way, in this year, the CPWDP organization in Zhejiang Province increased from 132 people to 755 people, and the distribution area expanded from 3 cities and counties to 10 cities and counties. Li Shihao even proposed to develop it to the townships in his hometown of Zhuji County.
Collecting Rubbish and Remnants of the Old Society Everywhere
The evil "great expansion" policy of the Zhang-Huang-Li rightist clique has made the composition of the CPWDP extremely complex. In this anti-Rightist struggle, organizations in many places have been paralyzed. The CPWDP Tianjin Municipal Organization developed from the original 13 members to 300 members in a few months. According to the statistical data of 95 members in 6 branches, more than 50% of the people had historical problems, including 18 members of reactionary parties and groups; 9 historical counter-revolutionaries, traitors, and reactionary sectarian members; 7 reactionary military and police personnel who had served as major general staff officers and colonel military doctors in the Kuomintang; 21 landlords, rich peasants, and capitalists with all kinds of vices; and members of the Kuomintang "Anti-Traitor Group" and corrupt officials, totaling 57 people.

These elements who held class hatred for the Communist Party and adhered to the reactionary class position, when the Communist Party's rectification began, responded to the reactionary words and deeds of rightist leaders such as Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji and launched a frenzied attack on the Communist Party. Thirteen rightist elements have been exposed so far. Li Wenhao, director of the Pediatrics Department of Tianjin Railway Central Hospital, who once served as a major general staff officer in the Kuomintang and hated the Communist Party very much, openly proposed in the blooming and letting period to abolish the "General Branch Committee and Security Section of the CCP" in the railway hospital and "elect section chiefs, department heads, and hospital directors by democratic vote," otherwise, "the CPWDP branch will hang up its signboard and lead hospital affairs jointly with the CCP branch." Huang Zhiyuan, an engineer at Tianjin Forging Machine Tool Factory, a rightist element, was a special member of the Kuomintang, the "leader of the Anti-Traitor Group," and had participated in the reactionary suppression of the workers' movement, occupied women, and committed numerous evils. He hated the Party and everything in the new society. After joining the CPWDP, he contacted Cheng Xiubiao, Liang Yuanheng, Wang Yiwu and other rightist elements, engineers of the Tianjin Electromechanical Industry Bureau, to form a reactionary group, attempting to usurp the technical leadership of the Electromechanical Industry Bureau.

Some places openly put forward the slogan of "opening the door to backwardness"; some proposed in the development that "historical problems are the responsibility of oneself," and the CPWDP organization would not ask about historical situations; some proposed "three no fear," that is, "one no fear of complex history; two no fear of backward thinking; three no fear of unemployment." Huang Zhen, a rightist element in Fujian Province, developed eight people in Putian County in one go, seven of whom were subjects of suppression of counter-revolutionaries who had not yet reached a conclusion. A person in the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Agriculture who had problems in the "Three-Anti" movement that had not yet been closed was absorbed into the CPWDP, and Li Shihao said triumphantly: "Precisely because of this, we want to absorb him."

In just over two months from April to June this year, the CPWDP organization in Shaanxi Province developed 144 members in more than 20 units in the medical and health community and engineering and technical community in Xi'an. According to the investigation, among the 97 members they developed in 14 units in the medical and health community in Xi'an, 49 belonged to reactionary party and group members and politically suspicious elements; 17 came from exploiting classes such as landlords, rich peasants, and capitalists, or had direct relatives who were sentenced and imprisoned and held class hatred for the Communist Party; 7 were subjects of investigation in previous movements. The above three categories accounted for 76% of the total number of CPWDP members in these 14 units.

    章黄李右派集团的恶性“大发展”
    使农工民主党组织陷于解体状态
    新华社16日讯  中国农工民主党组织在反右派斗争中，暴露出大批右派分子，组织成分极为复杂，整个农工组织陷于严重的瘫痪、解体状态。这种状况是由于控制农工民主党中央的章伯钧—黄琪翔—李伯球右派集团及其党羽执行恶性“大发展”方针所直接造成的。参加农工民主党比买电影票还容易
    天津有的人说，参加农工民主党比买张电影票还容易。从各地实际情况来看，这种话一点也不夸大，有的地方情况甚至还要严重。农工民主党浙江省主委、右派骨干分子李士豪野心勃勃地计划在全省发展七千人，为此他采用了“拉”、“骗”、“抢”、“挖”等种种卑劣的办法，到处拉人。为了发展一个历史反革命分子，李士豪亲自把“入党申请书”送上门去，他自任介绍人。农工福建省主委李述中甚至不惜用他妹妹来做钓饵，引诱别人加入农工。
    章黄李右派集团制定的农工民主党的组织路线，完全违反了农工民主党以医药卫生界为重点、以进步分子为骨干、发展一批中上层的具有代表性人物的组织原则。章伯钧一再提出，要“打破防区制”（即各民主党派有重点分工），并且说，不管“老年、青年、落后分子都可以发展”。农工原来只规定在大、中城市发展，现在到小城市、县、区去发展了。原来重点是医药卫生界，现在发展到各行各业。在发展的对象中，有判过刑的人，有劳改期满的人，有贪污分子，还有过去曾经参加过“军统”、“中统”的特务分子等等，总之，凡是对共产党心怀不满和仇恨党的人都拉到农工民主党里来了。
    去年7月，中华医学会、中国药学会、中国生理学会、中国微生物学会、中国解剖学会在北京联合举行全国会员代表大会，章伯钧、黄琪翔、李伯球经过密商，在北京饭店大请客，拢络来京开会的这些人回去扩大影响，发展组织。当时被邀请的有五百多人。“请客”之后，他们就把这些被请的人的名单发到各地去，指示地方组织和这些人联系。于是各地农工民主党组织“上行下效”，大规模地“请客”、举行“招待会”来拉人。
    接着，农工民主党中央组织部在去年8月份又发了指示给各级组织，批评各地的发展有“保守思想”、“小手小脚”、“过于偏重在开业医师，开业中医，不能把联系工作进一步扩大”，督促各地“动员一切力量”发展组织。农工中央组织部这时提出的口号是“大撒网”，不要用一根线“钓鱼”。章伯钧并派出他的大将、农工中央组织部副部长钟岱到天津去创造“先进经验”，钟岱从天津回来吹嘘他发展了一百多人（实际只有二十多人），而章伯钧又增加了一倍，吹嘘说：“钟岱在天津由原来的十三人发展到二百多人，这种工作经验要在农工民主党全党推广。”他并且要钟岱到北京市组织去介绍经验。
    在去年年底，章伯钧提出要在全国各大城市建立机构，凡是其他民主党派没有发展的地方，农工民主党“都应去建立机构，发展组织，占领阵地。”章伯钧提出农工民主党要发展八十万人。他并且要李伯球在北京市发展到一万人。派出六路大军到各地招兵买马
    到今年大鸣大放时期，这些右派分子对于发展组织已经到了狂热的程度。章伯钧派出了六路大军去各地招兵买马：王一帆去东北；杨逸棠去山东；张云川去河南；韩兆鹗去陕西；钟岱去太原、石家庄、保定；郭仲衡去昆明。
    这些右派分子到处招谣撞骗，用各种手段拉人入党。王一帆在东北花了一千九百多元大肆请客，他并对发展对象说：“你是统战部同意参加的；我们预备要你做省筹委会委员，我们省委会的部长，等于政府的厅长级干部。”杨逸棠在山东交代发展的任务时说：发展“可以不顾条件、不顾政治影响”。张云川在河南发展组织时说，农工民主党不要吸收那些向党汇报的“假积极分子”。
    在地方组织中，右派分子发展组织的花样更是无奇不有。济南的农工组织欺骗希望参加中共组织的人说：“中共二年之内不发展了，你参加农工后，我们可以把你输送给共产党”。农工武汉市组织则实行了所谓“三包”政策，即责成每一个成员要同时联系一个，培养一个，发展一个。福建省的右派分子到处宣传，“不参加民主党派，要做政协委员、人民委员会委员就不容易”。农工福建省副主委黄震在莆田县发展时，一天一夜散发了五十多份申请书。
    章伯钧所绝口称赞的天津农工民主党组织的发展手段是极其卑劣的。他们对于那些对党不满的人说：“加入农工后，你可以不受共产党的欺负”；对那些肃反中被审查的对象说：“加入农工可以帮助你平反”；对那些历史反革命分子说：“加入农工可以帮助你做出结论”。对于一些要求进步想参加共产党的人，则以甜言蜜语进行拉拢说：“农工和共产党一样，今后长期共存”。他们发展的步骤是找好“基地”，开列名单，然后四出请客或登门拜访，普遍撒表，载入名册。天津新华医院农工民主党支部负责人就公开向发展对象说：“你愿意参加也得参加，不愿参加也得参加。”他们甚至趁发展对象患病期中，强行填表拉入组织。天津铁路中心医院李文浩拉拢营养室主任尤桂珍入党时，就直接了当地说：“你填表吧，我们支部已经通过你入党了。”接着又叫她去参加农工民主党支部会议。浙江的李士豪为了扩大势力，以便“号召起来有力量”，指挥亲信和工作人员向各个角落渗透，其中有经济部门、国家机关、医药界、文艺界、青年、妇女、社会人士等各个方面。同时他还几次企图派人到青田县和东阳县去发展手工艺工人。这样，在这一年中，浙江省农工组织就由一百三十二人增加到七百五十五人，分布地区由三个市县扩大到十个市县。甚至李士豪还提出要在他的家乡诸暨县发展到乡镇去。到处收罗旧社会的垃圾残渣
    章黄李右派集团的恶性“大发展”方针，造成了农工内部的成份极为复杂，在这次反右派斗争中，许多地方的组织陷于瘫痪。农工天津市组织在几个月中由原有的十三个成员发展到三百个成员。根据六个支部九十五个成员的材料统计，有50％以上的人是有历史问题的，其中有反动党团分子十八人；有历史上的反革命分子、汉奸、反动会道门分子九人；有当过国民党少将参谋、上校军医等身份的反动军警人员七人；出身是恶霸地主、富农、五毒俱全的资本家的二十一人；还有国民党“锄奸小组组员”、贪污犯等，共计五十七人。
    这些对共产党怀有阶级仇恨，并坚持反动阶级立场的分子，在共产党整风开始，群起策应章伯钧、罗隆基等右派头目的反动言行，向共产党猖狂进攻。目前已被揭露的右派分子就有十三人。曾任国民党少将参谋、对共产党十分仇视的天津铁路中心医院小儿科主任李文浩，在鸣放中公然提出要取消铁路医院的“中共总支委员会和保卫股”，“用民主投票的方式选举科长、处长、院长”，否则，“农工民主党支部就挂牌办公，与中共支部共同领导医院事务”。天津锻压机床厂工程师、右派分子黄植原是国民党特别党员、“锄奸小组组长”、曾参与反动派镇压工人运动的活动，霸占妇女、作恶多端，他仇恨党，仇恨新社会的一切。他加入农工民主党后，联络了天津市机电工业局工程师、右派分子程秀标、梁元恒、王揖五等人，组成反动集团，企图篡夺机电工业局的技术领导权。
    有的地方公开提出“向落后开门”的口号；有的在发展中提出“历史问题由自己负责”，农工组织不过问历史情况；有的提出“三不怕”，即“一不怕历史复杂；二不怕思想落后；三不怕失业”。福建省的右派分子黄震在莆田县一次发展了八个人，其中有七个是尚未作结论的肃反对象。浙江省农业厅一个在“三反”中有问题尚未结案的人被吸收加入农工，李士豪得意地说：“正因为这一点，我们要吸收他”。
    陕西省农工民主党组织从今年4月到6月的短短两个多月的时间内，就在西安医药卫生界和工程技术界的二十多个单位中，发展了一百四十四个成员。据调查，他们在西安市医药卫生界的十四个单位所发展的九十七个成员中，属于反动党团分子和政治上有嫌疑的分子即有四十九人；出身地主、富农和资本家等剥削阶级或直系亲属被判刑、关押而对共产党怀有阶级仇恨的有十七人；在历次运动中被审查的对象有七人，以上三类共占这十四个单位的农工成员总数的76％。
