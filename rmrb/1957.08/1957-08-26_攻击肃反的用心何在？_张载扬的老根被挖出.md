What is the Purpose of Attacking the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries?
Zhang Zaiyang's Old Roots Dug Up

This newspaper reports that Zhang Zaiyang, a teaching assistant at the Beijing Foreign Trade Institute, maliciously fabricated and exaggerated the shortcomings of the suppression of counterrevolutionaries, denying its achievements. He said that the shortcomings of the suppression movement were primary, and the achievements were secondary; he also slandered that the mistakes of the suppression were a concentrated expression of the "Three Evils." Zhang Zaiyang also attempted to incite the masses to be dissatisfied with the Party and the movement to suppress counterrevolutionaries. He fabricated that the suppression turned young people into lunatics. He said: Why doesn't the Party committee dare to face the mistakes in the work of suppressing counterrevolutionaries squarely? Because they are afraid of affecting their prestige.

Why did Zhang Zaiyang attack the movement to suppress counterrevolutionaries? During the period when the Japanese devils ruled, Zhang Zaiyang worked as a translator for the Taixian Branch of the Japanese Devils' Subei Liaison Department, and as a supervisor and county propagandist and general affairs clerk for the Kuomintang Central Unification Bureau's Taixian and Yanfu Sub-districts. Later, he also joined the reactionary Three People's Principles Youth League. It was perfectly right to investigate him in the suppression of counterrevolutionaries. The broad masses of teachers and students of the school dug out his old roots, and he had nothing to say.

　　攻击肃反的用心何在？
　　张载扬的老根被挖出
    本报讯　北京对外贸易学院助教张载扬恶意?造和夸大肃反的缺点，否认肃反成绩。他说，肃反运动缺点是主要的，成绩是次要的；又污蔑说肃反的错误是三害的集中表现。张载扬还企图煽动群众对党、对肃反运动不满。他?造说：肃反把青年人斗成神经病。他说：党委为什么不敢正视肃反工作中的错误呢？是因为怕影响了威信。
    张载扬为什么攻击肃反运动呢？张载扬在日寇统治时期曾做过日寇苏北联络部泰县出张所翻译，国民党中统江苏泰县、盐阜分区督导员及县宣导员、总务干事等职，后又参加了反动的三青团。肃反中审查他是完全应该的。学校广大师生把他的老根挖出来，他无话可说了。
