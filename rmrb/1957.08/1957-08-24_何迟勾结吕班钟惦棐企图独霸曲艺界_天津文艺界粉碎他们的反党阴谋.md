    He Chi Colludes with Lü Ban and Zhong Dianfei in Attempt to Dominate the Quyi World
    Tianjin Literary and Art Circles Shatter Their Anti-Party Conspiracy
    (Our Newspaper) The Party Leadership Groups of the Tianjin Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Bureau of Culture recently held a series of extended meetings to expose the ugly anti-Party and anti-socialist face of He Chi, the vice-chairman of the Tianjin Branch of the Chinese Dramatists Association, the principal of the Tianjin Opera School, and a Communist Party writer.
    The meetings revealed that He Chi had colluded with Lü Ban, a rightist element within the Party and a director at the Changchun Film Studio, to jointly launch an attack on the Party and the people. Dissatisfied with his original work and position, he invited Lü Ban to Tianjin to secretly organize the "Spring Comedy Troupe" and attempted to establish a branch of the film studio in Tianjin, splitting "Chang Film" to start his own operation and escape the leadership of the Party. They presumptuously arranged the organizational structure and key personnel, with Lü Ban slated to be the head of the troupe and the director of the branch, He Chi as the general director, and even the Party branch secretary was internally designated to be Lü Ban's wife. They also planned for Lü Ban to become the vice-chairman of the Tianjin Dramatists Association to usurp the leadership of the Tianjin literary and art circles. When their conspiracy was exposed and rejected by the Tianjin Party and government leadership, He Chi expressed great dissatisfaction and wanted to leave Tianjin, with Lü Ban arranging for him to be a director and screenwriter at "Chang Film," as well as a member of the Changchun Federation of Literary and Art Circles, promising He Chi a small building, a promotion, and promising He Chi's wife to be the deputy head of the Changchun Pingju Opera Troupe.
    As early as 1954, He Chi had secretly collaborated with some people in Beijing, behind the backs of the Party and government organizations, to organize a national "Chinese Quyi and Acrobatics Academy," plotting to control the national Quyi, acrobatics, and circus arts, dreaming of becoming the director of the Quyi and Acrobatics Department of the Ministry of Culture.
    He Chi consistently disobeyed the work assigned by the Party, opposing the Party's literary and artistic guidelines and opera reform policies. Over the years, he adopted a completely negative, dismissive, and attacking attitude toward every attempt at opera reform made by the Tianjin opera circles. For example, the Tianjin Pingju Opera Troupe's attempt to perform "Liu Hulan" was completely rejected by He Chi. This year, he also published a talk in the tenth issue of "Drama News," attacking the Party's "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new" policy, slandering opera reform cadres as if someone had entered a museum, "shattering the jade and demanding others to respect their labor of shattering the jade." However, He Chi lavishly boasted about his own works, having them printed and published by typing services, personally promoting them to the troupes, attempting to control the entire city's troupes to perform his own and his cronies' programs. He Chi has consistently suppressed others and elevated himself in the Tianjin drama circles, effectively becoming a new "boss."
    In order to achieve his goal of controlling the Tianjin Quyi world, He Chi also conspired to usurp the Party's leadership over the Quyi world, so that the Quyi cause would return to the capitalist path. During the period of the Great Blooming and Contending, he "opened fire" on the municipal Party committee during the Tianjin Quyi Performance in mid-June. When He Chi spoke at the opening ceremony of the performance, he deliberately exaggerated certain problems existing in the work of the Quyi world, provoking the relationship between the performers and the Party and government, saying that the Bureau of Culture was a "strict mother-in-law," the Literary and Art Workers' Union was a "junior mother-in-law," and the Quyi actors were "commoners." He believed that "the current organization of Quyi is not suitable for the laws of Quyi work" and that "the organization of Quyi troupes is restricting the development of Quyi work." He put forward his own comprehensive, programmatic "plan."
    He Chi's anti-Party and anti-socialist thoughts are also reflected in his works. In the name of "the art of laughter" and "satire," he only emphasized "exposing darkness," pursuing the vulgar tastes of the bourgeoisie, wantonly exaggerating and distorting real life, and maliciously slandering and attacking the new society, the Party, and the people. This spring, he wrote an absurd and extremely reactionary crosstalk "Unification Sickness." In this crosstalk, He Chi fabricated a mayor of a large city with a million people who suffered from "unification sickness." This mayor, in order to pursue "unification," not only canceled the names of all the people in the city, compiling them into numbers, so that everyone would eat, defecate, and sleep according to the command of the unified signal, but also, in order to "unify" people's height and appearance, forced all the people in the city to eat a kind of "unification medicine," turning people into ten "specifications" of identical people, resulting in fathers and sons, husbands and wives unable to recognize each other, and the world in chaos, and had to "restore the original face." He Chi openly stood on the enemy's position to oppose the country's socialist system. He described the masses of the people as "banknotes" compiled into numbers and "machines" under the command of unified signals.
    When the Great Blooming and Contending began, he wrote an article in the "New Port" magazine, openly opposing the Party's leadership over literary and artistic creation, proposing the slogan "use works to lead creation," and even saying that the Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Writers' Association were institutions that "restrict creation."
    The meeting also revealed that He Chi and the rightist element within the Party, Zhong Dianfei, an editorial board member of "Literary and Art Newspaper," had long colluded with each other, spreading anti-Party remarks and carrying out various unspeakable activities. Many of He Chi's works were discussed with Zhong Dianfei or written under Zhong's instructions. After Zhong Dianfei's anti-Party article "The Gongs and Drums of Film" was criticized, He Chi expressed deep sympathy for Zhong and gave Zhong 400 yuan, and told people: "This is exactly the time when friends are needed!" After He Chi's anti-Party letter was published in the July issue of "People's Literature" this year, Zhong Dianfei regretted for He Chi and said: "Such a short article of five hundred words, letting people grab a lot of pigtails, is too unworthy." After the anti-Rightist struggle began, He Chi went to Beijing to have a secret talk with Zhong Dianfei, and Zhong told him to "be cautious in words and deeds" in the future.
    He Chi boasted that he was an "all-rounder writer" who was "able to write, direct, and perform," but in reality, he was a "peddler" in the creative world. According to Zhang Qizhi, who took shorthand and organized his manuscripts, and Cui Xingren of the People's Publishing House, He Chi's so-called "creation" was mostly plagiarism and theft. For example, most of his "One Hundred Jokes" were copied from a "Trainload of Jokes," and a small part was from crosstalk performers' skits.
    The meeting was presided over by Wang Lin, deputy secretary of the Party Leadership Group of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles. He pointed out: The Party discovered He Chi's mistakes early. During the Three-Anti and Five-Anti campaigns, he was given punishment for unclear boundaries with theater bosses Wang Shier, Zhuge An, etc., and for corruption and embezzlement. After the anti-Hu Feng struggle, his bourgeois thoughts and small group activities were criticized. But He Chi adopted a two-faced approach to the Party, disobeying orders overtly while complying covertly, continuing to carry out anti-Party activities, and becoming increasingly more serious.
    In his self-criticism, He Chi admitted that he had an anti-Party conspiracy, that he had wooed people in the Tianjin opera circles to organize an anti-Party small group, and that he had colluded with Lü Ban, Zhong Dianfei and others in an attempt to dominate the national Quyi world.

    何迟勾结吕班钟惦棐企图独霸曲艺界
    天津文艺界粉碎他们的反党阴谋
    本报讯　中共天津市文联和文化局党组，最近连续举行扩大会议，揭露中国戏剧家协会天津分会副主席、天津市戏曲学校校长、共产党员作家何迟反党反社会主义的丑恶面目。
    会上揭露何迟曾同党内右派分子、长春电影制片厂导演吕班，勾结一起，共同向党和人民发起进攻。他不满意自己原来的工作和地位，因此约吕班来天津，和他秘密组织“春天喜剧团”，并企图在天津设立电影制片厂分厂，分裂“长影”，另搞一摊，来摆脱党的领导。他们妄自安排好了组织机构和主要人事，预定由吕班当团长和厂长，何迟当总编导，甚至连党的支部书记都已内定由吕班的妻子担任。他们还准备要吕班做天津市剧协的副主席，以篡夺天津文艺界的领导权。当他们的阴谋被识破，遭到天津市党政领导上的拒绝以后，何迟表示非常不满，想离开天津，由吕班在“长影”为其安排导演兼编剧、长春市文联委员等职位，并应许给何迟小楼一所，提升一级，还应许何迟的妻子做长春评剧团的副团长。
    何迟早在1954年，就曾与北京的一些人，背着党政组织，合谋组织全国性的“中国曲艺杂技院”，阴谋把持全国的曲艺、杂技和马戏艺术，妄想做文化部的曲艺杂技处处长。
    何迟对于党所委派的工作，一贯阳奉阴违，反对党的文艺方针和戏曲改革政策。几年来，他对于天津市戏曲界在戏曲改革上所作的每一个尝试，几乎都是采取了完全否定、抹煞和打击的态度。如天津市评剧团尝试演出“刘胡兰”，就遭到何迟的全盘否定。今年他还在“戏剧报”十期上发表谈话，大肆攻击党的“百花齐放，推陈出新”的政策，诬蔑戏改干部如同一个人进了博物馆，“把翡翠都摔碎了，还让别人尊重他摔碎翡翠的劳动”。但何迟对于自己的作品，则大肆吹嘘，交打字行打印出版，亲自向剧团推销，企图一手控制全市剧团上演他自己及其同伙的节目。何迟在天津戏剧界一贯打击别人，抬高自己，实际上已经成为一个新的“把头”。
    何迟为了达到自己把持天津曲艺界的目的，还阴谋篡夺党对曲艺界的领导权，使曲艺事业回到资本主义老路上去。大鸣大放期间，他乘6月中旬举行的天津市曲艺会演，向市委“开炮”。何迟在会演开幕式上讲话时，故意夸大曲艺界工作中存在的某些问题，挑拨艺人与党和政府的关系，说文化局是“大婆婆”，文艺工会是“小婆婆”，曲艺演员是“草民”。他认为“目前曲艺的组织不适合曲艺工作的规律”，“曲艺团的组织是限制曲艺工作发展的”。他提出了自己全面的、纲领性的“计划”。
    何迟反党反社会主义的思想，也体现在他的作品中。他以“笑的艺术”和“讽刺”为名，一味强调“揭露黑暗”，追求资产阶级的庸俗趣味，肆意夸张和歪曲现实生活，对新社会、对党和人民进行恶毒的诽谤和攻击。他在今年春天，写了一篇荒谬绝伦、极端反动的相声“统一病”。在这个相声中，何迟捏造了一个害了“统一病”的百万人口大城市的市长，这个市长为了追求“统一”，不仅把全市人民都取消姓名，编成号码，使大家按照统一信号的指挥吃饭、拉屎、睡觉，而且为了“统一”人的身材面貌，强迫全市人民都吃一种“统一药”，把人变成十种“规格”的一模一样的人，结果闹得父子、夫妇不能相认，天下大乱，不得不“恢复本来面目”。何迟公然站到敌人的立场上，来反对国家的社会主义制度。他把人民群众形容成是编成号码的“钞票”，和在统一信号指挥下的“机器”。
    大鸣大放开始时，他在“新港”杂志上写文章，公然反对党对文艺创作的领导，提出“要用作品来领导创作”的口号，甚至说文联、作协是“限制创作”的机关。
    会上还揭露了何迟和党内右派分子、“文艺报”编委钟惦棐长期相互勾结，散布反党言论，进行各种不可告人的活动。何迟的许多作品，都是和钟惦棐商量或由钟授意写成的。钟惦棐的反党文章“电影的锣鼓”受到批判后，何迟对钟深表同情，并曾送给钟人民币四百元，还向人表示：“这正是需要朋友的时候！”今年“人民文学”7月号发表了何迟反党的一封信后，钟惦棐为何迟惋惜地说：“短短五百字的文章，让人家抓了一大把辫子，太不值得了。”反右派斗争开始后，何迟曾到北京找钟惦棐密谈，钟告诉他今后要“谨言慎行”。
    何迟自己吹嘘是一个“能编、能导、能演”的“全才作家”，实际上却是个创作界的“商贩”。据替他速记和整理稿件的张奇稚和人民出版社的崔兴仁等揭发，何迟的所谓“创作”，绝大多数是抄袭、剽窃的。如他的“笑话一百种”，绝大部分是从一本“笑话一火车”上抄来的，少部分是相声艺人的段子。
    会议由文联党组副书记王林主持。他指出：党对何迟的错误早有发觉。三反、五反时，曾因其与戏剧界把头王十二、诸葛安等界限不清及贪污腐化行为，给予处分。反胡风斗争后，又对他的资产阶级思想及小集团活动给予批评。但何迟对党采取了两面手法，阳奉阴违，继续进行反党活动，并且日益变本加厉。
    何迟在他的检讨中，承认自己有反党阴谋，在天津戏曲界拉拢人组织了反党小集团，并和吕班、钟惦棐等人勾结起来，企图独霸全国曲艺界。
