U.S. New Conspiracy Against Syria
　　Commentator of This Newspaper

    U.S. President Eisenhower made a speech at a press conference on the 21st, openly making malicious slander against Syria and the Soviet Union. He described the Syrian government's recent just actions in cracking down on U.S. subversive plots domestically and safeguarding its own national independence and sovereignty as "infiltration" of Syria by Soviet "agents"; and stated that the United States is currently closely watching the development of the Syrian situation, and the United States "must not allow itself to fall into an intolerable situation." The U.S. President's blatant acts of interfering in other countries' internal affairs and arbitrarily slandering other countries not only disregard the most basic norms of modern international relations, but also show that the United States harbors extremely sinister intentions towards the current Syrian nationalist government.

    After the failure of the U.S.-planned subversion of the current Syrian government, the United States has been attempting to openly interfere in Syrian internal affairs. The United States has launched its propaganda machine, spreading a large number of rumors and slanders, rudely attacking the Syrian government, and provoking relations between other Arab countries and Syria. The United States has intensified its dumping of surplus U.S. agricultural products at depressed prices in Syria's traditional wheat market, attempting to make it impossible for Syria's wheat, an important source of finance, to be exported, in order to create financial difficulties for Syria. These crude methods that the United States is now using to deal with Syria were also used when dealing with Egypt's announcement of the recovery of the Suez Canal Company and planning to overthrow the Nabusi nationalist government in Jordan. The purpose is to bring down the current Syrian nationalist government and change Syria's positive neutral policy of safeguarding its national independence and sovereignty, so that it can unscrupulously pursue its aggressive policies in the Middle East.

    From Eisenhower's speech and the United States' activities in the Middle East, it can be seen that the United States is now secretly planning a new aggressive conspiracy against Syria. The U.S. President is willing to personally come forward at this time to slander Syria and the Soviet Union, no more than wanting to find an excuse for the United States to further interfere in Syrian internal affairs. There are now many signs that the United States is attempting to have some Baghdad Pact member states neighboring Syria come forward to interfere in Syria. Eisenhower's speech was intended to incite these countries to take interventionist action against Syria. Recently, the U.S. State Department has been constantly "discussing" the Syrian situation with the British Ambassador to the United States, and maintaining frequent contact with representatives of Turkey, Iraq and other countries in the Baghdad Pact. The heads of state of Iraq and Turkey are also holding secret talks on the Syrian situation, which is by no means accidental. News has confirmed that the U.S. Sixth Fleet, which is conducting so-called "exercises" in the western Mediterranean, is currently on its way to the eastern Mediterranean, which further proves that the United States' new plan to invade Syria is being accelerated.

    Now, the Syrian government and people, determined to defend their national independence and sovereignty, have raised their vigilance. The Syrian government has arrested a number of officers involved in the U.S. subversive plot, and the Syrian army has strengthened its border defenses. The Syrian government has also warned the imperialists that any interference in Syria's internal affairs will only cause tension in the Middle East situation and undermine peace in the Middle East, and will never make Syria change its independent policy. Obviously, the Syrian people have the strength to defeat the U.S.-planned subversive conspiracy, and they will also have enough strength to stop any external open interference. The Syrian government and people's struggle to safeguard their national independence is just, and it will receive the sympathy and support of the people all over the world.

    美国对叙利亚的新阴谋
　　本报评论员
    美国总统艾森豪威尔21日在记者招待会上发表谈话，公然对叙利亚和苏联进行了恶毒的诬蔑。他把叙利亚政府最近在国内破获美国颠覆阴谋、维护自己国家独立和主权的正义行动，说成是苏联“代理人”对叙利亚的“渗入”；并且表示，美国目前正在密切注视叙利亚局势的发展，美国“决不能让自己陷于一种无法忍受的境地”。美国总统这种露骨地干涉别国内政、任意诬蔑其他国家的行径，不仅是无视现代国际关系中最起码的准则，而且表明美国对叙利亚民族主义现政府抱着极其险恶的用心。
    美国在它策划的颠覆叙利亚现政府的阴谋败露以后，便一直在企图公开干涉叙利亚内政。美国发动它的宣传机器，散布大量谣言和诽谤，对叙利亚政府进行粗野的攻击，并挑拨其他阿拉伯国家同叙利亚的关系。美国加紧了在叙利亚小麦的传统市场上压价抛售美国的剩余农产品，妄图使叙利亚财政重要来源的小麦无法出口，以制造叙利亚的财政困难。美国现在对付叙利亚的这些粗暴作法，在对付埃及宣布收回苏伊士运河公司和策划推翻约旦纳布西民族主义政府的时候都曾使用过，目的就是要搞垮叙利亚民族主义现政府，改变叙利亚维护自己国家独立主权的积极中立政策，以便它在中东地区肆无忌惮地推行侵略政策。
    从艾森豪威尔的谈话和美国在中东的活动中可以看出，现在美国正在暗中策划一个对付叙利亚的新的侵略阴谋。美国总统在这个时候不惜亲自出面来对叙利亚和苏联进行诬蔑诽谤，无非是想为美国进一步干涉叙利亚内政找寻借口。现在有许多迹象表明，美国正企图通过一些同叙利亚邻近的巴格达条约集团国家来出面干涉叙利亚。艾森豪威尔的谈话，就是想煽动这些国家对叙利亚采取干涉行动。最近，美国国务院同英国驻美大使就叙利亚局势不断进行“商讨”，并同巴格达条约中的土耳其、伊拉克等国代表保持经常接触，而伊拉克和土耳其的国家首脑也正在就叙利亚局势进行密谈，这决不是偶然的事。已经有消息证实，在西地中海进行所谓“演习”的美国第六舰队，目前正在驶向东地中海的途中，这就更加证明美国侵略叙利亚的新策划正在加紧进行中。
    现在，决心保卫自己国家独立主权的叙利亚政府和人民，已经提高警惕。叙利亚政府已经逮捕了一批同美国颠覆阴谋有关的军官，叙利亚军队加强了边境的戒备。叙利亚官方并且向帝国主义发出警告，任何对叙利亚内政的干涉行动，都只会引起中东局势的紧张，破坏中东的和平，而决不会使叙利亚改变自己的独立政策。显然，叙利亚人民有力量打垮美国策划的颠覆阴谋，也会有足够的力量来制止任何外来的公开干涉。叙利亚政府和人民维护自己国家独立的斗争是正义的，它将得到全世界人民的同情和支持。
