Xinhua News Agency, 6th dispatch from Hiroshima: The people of Hiroshima, Japan, the first city to be attacked by an atomic bomb, held a solemn gathering this morning to commemorate the victims who were killed by the American atomic bomb twelve years ago today.

At eight o'clock in the morning, approximately 20,000 Hiroshima citizens gathered at the Atomic Bomb Victims Memorial Tower in Hiroshima's Peace Memorial Park to hold a ceremony to mourn the dead and pray for peace. Hiroshima Mayor Tadao Watanabe placed the register of 185 people who had died in the past year as a result of atomic bomb injuries into the stone coffin inside the tower. Mayor Watanabe, Their Imperial Highnesses Prince and Princess Mikasa, the younger brother and sister-in-law of the Emperor who attended the ceremony, and orphans Nakamura Katsumi and Sasaki Kyoko, representatives of the atomic bomb victims' families, laid wreaths at the memorial tower.

In the Hiroshima Peace Declaration read by Mayor Watanabe at the ceremony, he pointed out that possessing atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs and conducting tests, attempting to maintain peace by utilizing strength, is merely a foolish fantasy. The declaration called on the people of the world to quickly choose the path of human peace and to free humanity from the disaster of atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs.

As Watanabe read the Peace Declaration, seven hundred peace doves flew into the sky.

At 8:15 a.m., Takeda Kunie, a young girl who had been injured by the atomic bomb, rang the Peace Bell at the venue. Then, the bells of the World Peace Memorial Hall and various temples and churches in the city, as well as the sirens of various factories, sounded in unison. At this moment, 350,000 citizens of Hiroshima stood in silence for one minute, mourning the dead and praying for peace.

The Hiroshima Conference of the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs was also held in Hiroshima this morning. In the evening, floating lanterns will be released on the seven rivers.

According to Xinhua News Agency, 6th dispatch from Tokyo: On the twelfth anniversary of Hiroshima's suffering from the American atomic bombing, twelve scientists, including Honorary Professor Arata Osada of Hiroshima University, issued the "Hiroshima Declaration," calling on scientists in the East and West to unite and strive for world peace.

In this declaration, the twelve scientists from Hiroshima expressed their support for the "Göttingen Declaration" issued by West German scientists, and expressed their respect for the West German scientists' advocacy of preventing the manufacture of nuclear weapons and using atomic energy only for peaceful purposes. Mikawa Hiroshi, President of Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto, and 160 other faculty members also issued a statement yesterday, demanding that the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union immediately stop atomic and nuclear weapons tests.

    新华社6日讯　广岛消息：第一次遭到原子弹袭击的日本广岛市人民，今天上午举行了隆重集会，追悼在十二年前的今天遭到美国原子弹杀害的牺牲者。
    上午八点钟，约有两万广岛市民在广岛市的和平纪念公园的原子弹牺牲者纪念塔前举行追悼死者和祈祷和平的典礼。广岛市长渡边忠雄把由于受原子弹伤害而在过去一年中死亡的一百八十五人的名册放入塔内的石棺里。渡边市长和来参加典礼的日皇的弟弟三笠宫夫妇，以及代表原子弹牺牲者遗族的孤儿中村克己和佐佐木京子在纪念塔前献了花圈。
    渡边市长在典礼上宣读的广岛市的和平宣言指出，拥有原子弹和氢弹并且进行试验，企图利用实力来维持和平，只不过是愚蠢的幻想而已。宣言要求世界各国人民迅速选择人类和平的道路，使人类摆脱原子弹和氢弹的灾害。
    在渡边宣读和平宣言的时候，七百只和平鸽飞上了天空。
    八点十五分，被原子弹伤害过的少女武田国技敲起了会场内的和平钟，接着，市内的世界和平纪念堂和各寺院、教堂的钟声以及各工厂等的汽笛齐鸣，这时，广岛市的三十五万市民都就地静默一分钟，悼念死者和祈祷和平。
    广岛市还在今天上午举行了禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会广岛大会。晚上，七河川上还要放河灯。
    据新华社6日讯　东京消息：在广岛遭受美国原子弹轰炸十二周年的今天，广岛大学名誉教授长田新等十二位科学家发表“广岛宣
  言”，呼吁东西方的科学家们联合起来为争取世界和平而奋斗。
    在这个宣言中，广岛的十二位科学家表示支持西德科学家发表的“戈丁根宣言”，并且对于西德科学家主张阻止制造核武器，把原子能只用来为和平服务的行为，表示敬意。京都立命馆大学校长未川博等一百六十位教职员也在昨天发表声明，要求美、英、苏三国立即停止原子武器和核武器试验。
