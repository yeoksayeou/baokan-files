    A Secret Diary

    This is a diary that a rightist element from the Sichuan Geological Bureau was forced to hand over during a struggle session. Everyone can see what a malicious attack this is, how profound the hatred revealed here!

    This deeply hidden rightist element, Jiang Rende, is a laboratory technician at the Sichuan Geological Bureau, 22 years old, from Wuxi County, Jiangsu Province. His family was a landlord. During the land reform, the peasants divided his family's land, so he harbored a deep hatred and was "determined" to overthrow the new society.

    Because the Great Blooming and Contending in Chongqing was a bit late, Jiang Rende thought he hadn't released much, and the masses couldn't catch him. But as the anti-rightist struggle deepened, Zhu Shangzhi, a staff member who was close to him, still exposed him. Not long ago, when Zhu Shangzhi borrowed a book from Jiang Rende, he discovered that this rightist element had a secret diary. During the anti-rightist struggle, after everyone's investigation, Jiang Rende handed over this diary.

    In his diary on May 19, 1955, Jiang Rende wrote: "For me, 'battle' is the only word. I know that a China of slave labor will not last long. I have an ambition, an unspeakable ambition—of course, now it seems that I am extremely 'reactionary': Battle! Battle! Battle!"

    In his diary on June 30, he wrote: "Tomorrow is the 'Party's' birthday. I hate this birthday because it brought shackles to China. The entire Communist China is full of darkness and inequality. I hate the Communist Party. I hate the Chinese system. I want to overthrow this system." Then, Jiang Rende recorded a "reactionary poem" he wrote: "Today, I am bound in the school (note: referring to his studies at the geological school), they regard me as a useless fellow. If one day my ambitions are fulfilled, I will set half of China ablaze, ... daring to stain the Yangtze River with blood."

    In his diary on July 1, he wrote: "Today is the 'Party's' birthday, and also everyone's day of disaster."

    In his diary on July 7, he wrote: "A person must have courage no matter where he is, even in death he must find a way to survive. As long as there is perseverance, one can overcome everything and realize subjective desires. ... So I will always trust that I will win. If I become a writer, I will vehemently attack the forced slavery system in my works. Of course, this may involve bloodshed. I will shed the last drop of my blood to attack them. Battle! Battle! Battle the wolves.

    "Of course, the battle is not simple. I must be good at coping, and when necessary, I must follow it, comply outwardly but disobey inwardly."

    In his diary on July 10, he wrote: "I know that I am now in a long night, ... break through this darkness, even if my head is buried in the thatched grass of the long night. Slave China will surely disintegrate! Red Party China will surely perish!"

    On July 23, he wrote in his diary: "Received a letter from home, tears streaming down. I won't talk about the difficulties at home, often eating green pumpkins and wheat foods. How hateful, even rice cannot be eaten. But I also know who is causing the people to suffer. I want to overthrow this unreasonable system."

    On October 29, he wrote in his diary: "There is nothing to say to these many slaves, only to cut them with knives and axes."

    On November 8, he wrote in his diary: "From now on, I must change my combat methods. One day, I will climb up again..."

    On November 11, he wrote in his diary: "Considering other issues, I should not vent in my diary, it would be too late for regret if it is lost."

    On November 14, he wrote in his diary: "If people do not respect me, I must answer them with a whip. One should not disbelieve in oneself, slowly come again. Come again! Come again! One must go in and out of mountains of knives and forests of arrows, be able to charge, and also be able to defend. ... Remember the insults suffered (note: referring to criticisms of him), where there's a will, there's a way, one must have ambition! Have ambition!"

    On March 20, 1957, Jiang Rende wrote: "Too much talking, should talk less, too much shooting (boasting), should not shoot, remember, from now on should not shoot (boast), must be patient..."

    Jiang Rende began writing a diary on May 2, 1955, and from the beginning, he nakedly exposed a ferocious face. According to the exposure by the Sichuan Geological Bureau, Jiang Rende openly declared: "I would rather be a poor child of capitalism than a free citizen of socialism."

    The above is only a part of Jiang Rende's "unspeakable" things, just as he himself said in his diary on December 12 last year: "Diaries are also easily discovered by people, in the future... write as little as possible, keep it in your heart..." (Xinhua News Agency Special)

### 一本秘密日记

    一本秘密日记
    这是四川地质局一个右派分子在斗争中被迫交出的一本日记。大家看，这是多么恶毒的攻击，这里流露出多么深刻的仇恨！
    这个隐藏很深的右派分子——蒋仁德，是四川地质局的化验员，现年二十二岁，江苏无锡县人，家庭是地主，土地改革的时候，农民分了他家的土地，于是他就埋藏着深刻的仇恨，“立志”要推翻新社会。
    这次因为重庆大鸣大放迟一步，蒋仁德自认没有放出多少东西，群众抓不住他。但随着反右派斗争的深入，同他接近的工作人员朱尚志仍然把他揭发出来。不久以前朱尚志向蒋仁德借书的时候，发现这个右派分子有一本秘密日记。在反右派斗争中，经大家追查，蒋仁德交出了这本日记。
    蒋仁德在1955年5月19日的日记中写道：“对我说来，‘战斗’，只有这二字。奴隶劳动的中国，我知道不会久存的，我有一个志向，不可告人的志向——当然，现在看来我是极端‘反动’的：战斗！战斗！战斗！”
    6月30日的日记中写道：“明天是‘党’的生日，我恨这个生日，因为它给中国带来了枷锁。整个共产党中国到处有黑暗，不平等，我恨共党，我恨中国制度，我要推翻这制度。”接着，蒋仁德记录了他写的一首“反诗”：“今日束手困地校（按：指他在地质学校学习），把我看作无用佬，假如他日随我志，管叫中国半个天下满火烧，……敢叫血染长江流。”
    7月1日的日记中写道：“今天是‘党’的生日，也是大家的灾日。”
    7月7日的日记中写道：“一个人无论在什么地方都要有勇气，那怕在死亡中也要走出活路来。只要有毅力，就能战胜一切，就能实现主观愿望。……所以我终久信任自己会胜利的，假如我成为作家的话，我将在作品中向奴隶强迫制进行猛击。当然，这可能要流血的，我要流尽最后一滴血，向他们猛击。战斗！战斗！向恶狼战斗。
    “当然，战斗不是简单的，我要善于应付，必要时要顺着它，阴违阳奉的。”
    7月10日的日记中写道：“我知道，我现在在长夜中，……冲破这黑暗，那怕我的头埋葬在长夜的茅草中。奴隶中国一定会解体！红党中国一定会消灭！”
    7月23日的日记上写道：“接家信，泪如淋。家里困难不说了，常常吃些青南瓜、麦类食物。可恶，连饭都吃不到了。但我也能知道谁使人民痛苦的，我要推翻这不合理的制度。”
    10月29日的日记写道：“对这许多奴才，没有什么可说的，只有用刀斧来砍。”
    11月8日的日记上写道：“今后要改变战斗方法，总有一天，余爬了起来，……”
    11月11日的日记上写道：“考虑到其他问题，我不应在日记上发泄，万一遗失后悔莫及。”
    11月14日的日记写道：“倘人们不尊重我的时候，我一定要用鞭子来回答他。不应自己不相信自己，慢慢的再来。再来！再来！要在刀山箭林中进出，要会冲刺，也要会防守。……记住所受的侮辱（按：指批评了他），有志者事竟成，应有志！有志！”
    1957年3月20日，蒋仁德写道：“说话太多了，应少说，枪（腔）开（得）太多了，应不开，记住，今后应不开枪（腔），要有耐心……”
    蒋仁德于1955年5月2日开始作日记，一开头就赤裸裸暴露出一付狰狞面目。据四川地质局的揭发，蒋仁德公然宣称：“宁愿作资本主义贫困儿，不愿作社会主义自由民”。
    以上只是蒋仁德“不可告人”的东西的一部分，正如他自己在去年12月12日的日记上所说：“日记也容易为人所发现的，以后……要尽量少记，放在心里……”。　（新华社专稿）
