Xinhua News Agency, Shangqiu, 2nd – Eighty-three officers and soldiers of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, participating in the flood prevention and rescue efforts in eastern Henan, rescued over ten thousand disaster-stricken compatriots from flooded towns and villages in Shangqiu, Sui County, and Luyi County. They also salvaged seven thousand bolts of cloth and a large quantity of state materials.

On July 14th, after several consecutive days of torrential rain, a breach occurred in the Baogong Riverbank at Dengbinkou, twelve li northwest of Shangqiu City. It was during a stormy night when this unit arrived. They jumped into the water and formed a human chain of over fifty people, holding their position in the raging current of the breach overnight. When a large number of laborers and materials for closing the breach arrived at daybreak, the breach was quickly sealed, sparing the ten thousand people of Shangqiu City from the flood disaster.

Subsequently, this unit rushed to Sui County City, which was in urgent need of help. The soldiers, using rubber boats, rescued over ten thousand disaster-stricken compatriots from the flooded Sui County City. In shallow waters where the boats could not move, the soldiers preferred to jump into the water and drag the boats rather than let the disaster victims disembark and wade through the water. Some soldiers ate only one baked bun a day and were very hungry, but no one touched any of the large quantities of brown sugar and food salvaged from the water. Soldiers Zhang Xunliang and Pan Wenxun found several duck eggs in the water and also handed them over to the flood prevention headquarters.

After completing the rescue mission in Sui County, this unit, aboard nine rubber boats and four wooden boats, headed straight for Xuanwu Village in Luyi County to participate in the breach sealing project. After fifteen days of intense struggle, the floodwaters receded, and the submerged land was exposed, only then did they return to their station.

    河南某部官兵奋不顾身
    救出灾民一万多人
    新华社商丘2日电　参加豫东防汛抢险斗争的中国人民解放军某机关的八十三名军官和士兵，在商丘、雎县、鹿邑等县，从被洪水淹没的城镇和村庄里，抢救出一万多个受灾同胞，打捞出七千匹布和大批国家的物资。
    7月14日，在连降几次暴雨之后，商丘市西北十二华里的邓斌口，在包河南岸被洪水冲毁了一处决口。那时，正是风雨交加的夜晚，这支部队赶到这里，跳下水去用五十多个人的肉体结成防线，在决口的激流中坚守了一夜。等到天明大批民工和堵口物资来到以后，很快地堵住了决口，使商丘市的十万人民免受洪水灾害。
    接着，这支部队又奔赴告急的雎县城。战士们撑着橡皮船，在被洪水淹没的雎县城抢救出一万多受灾的同胞。在水浅船行不动的地方，战士宁肯跳下水中拖着船走，也不让船上的灾民下来涉水。有的战士一天只吃一个烧饼，十分饥饿，但是，从水中打捞出的大批红糖和食品，没有人去吃一口。战士张训亮、潘文勋在水中拾了几只鸭蛋，也带回交给防汛指挥部。
    这支部队在完成雎县抢救任务后，又乘着九只橡皮船和四只木船，直奔鹿邑县的玄武集，参加堵口工程。经过十五天的紧张斗争，洪水低头了，被淹没的土地已露出了地面，他们才返回驻地。
