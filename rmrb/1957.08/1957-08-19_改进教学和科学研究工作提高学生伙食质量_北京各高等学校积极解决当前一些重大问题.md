Xinhua News Agency, August 18th: The Chinese Communist Party committees of various universities and colleges in Beijing are actively addressing improvements in teaching, scientific research, and welfare, based on opinions raised by teachers, students, and staff during the rectification campaign.

Beijing College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing Russian Language Institute, Beijing Educational Administration College, Renmin University of China, and others, with the assistance of relevant central departments, are resolving major issues facing the schools. Preparations for the merger of Peking Union Medical College with the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences have begun, which will make it a national center for medical science research. Beijing College of Traditional Chinese Medicine previously suffered from serious problems such as a lack of school buildings and faculty, affecting the school's development. The Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Higher Education have now approved the construction of 8,000 square meters of buildings. In terms of faculty, more than 20 TCM teaching staff have been transferred from Nanjing, and other issues such as teaching guidelines, tasks, equipment, and funding are also being resolved. Renmin University of China is also working on improving the teaching of political theory courses.

Various schools have also made improvements in scientific research conditions and the training of teaching assistants. The Department of Civil Engineering at Tsinghua University and the Beijing Mining Institute have begun to prepare for the construction of repair workshops, specifically to serve laboratories and scientific research work. After studying the issue of improving the training of teaching assistants, Tsinghua University has approved 63 people to apply to general universities and 92 people to apply to night universities.

Currently, the follow-up work of the anti-Party clique movement has been fully or basically completed in twenty-six universities and colleges. Various schools have also apologized to and restored the reputations of individuals who were mistakenly struggled against as counter-revolutionaries within the original scope of the struggle.

Various schools have also corrected some unreasonable phenomena in wage levels and the use of welfare funds based on mass opinions. According to statistics from twenty-six schools including Peking University and Tsinghua University, 69 party member cadres voluntarily lowered their positions and salaries, and 61 people returned unreasonable welfare subsidies. For example, the Beijing Foreign Languages Institute has announced that the salaries of seven party member cadres will be reduced by one grade, with salary reductions taking effect from August. In terms of improving meals, Tsinghua University, Beijing Institute of Aeronautics, and Beijing Art Normal College have also achieved results in improving the quality of meals and reducing the labor intensity of kitchen staff.

Since the launch of the rectification campaign in early May, universities and colleges in Beijing have made many suggestions to Party organizations through various forms such as discussion groups, big-character posters, and school publications. In order to resolve problems in an organized and step-by-step manner, the CCP committees of various schools have established specialized groups to be responsible for studying and handling these opinions. At present, the work of rectifying and correcting while rectifying is being carried out in depth in various schools. Beijing Mining Institute is composed of 50 teachers and more than 10 administrative cadres, forming 11 groups to study issues such as the authority of teaching and research groups, confidentiality regulations, faculty training, and book supply, and then put forward a comprehensive improvement plan.

    改进教学和科学研究工作提高学生伙食质量
    北京各高等学校积极解决当前一些重大问题
    新华社18日讯　北京市各高等学校的中共党委根据整风期间师生员工提出的意见，积极在教学、科学研究、生活福利等各方面有步骤地着手改进。
    北京市中医学院、中国协和医学院、北京俄语学院、北京教育行政学院、中国人民大学等分别在中央各有关部门的帮助下，正在解决学校面临的一些重大问题。中国协和医学院同中国医学科学院合并的筹备工作已经开始，它将成为全国医学科学的研究中心。北京中医学院原来校舍、师资缺乏等问题比较严重，影响学校的发展。现在已由卫生部、高教部批准建筑八千平方公尺的房屋。师资方面已从南京调来二十多名中医教学人员，其它教学方针任务、设备经费等问题也在解决中。中国人民大学在关于改进政治理论课教学方面的工作，也正在进行。
    各校在科学研究条件、教学辅助人员的培养等方面，也有了改进。清华大学土木系和北京矿业学院分别开始筹建修配车间，专门为实验室和科学研究工作服务。清华大学研究了改进教学辅助人员的培养问题以后，已经批准了六十三人报考一般大学，九十二人报考夜大学。
    现在，有二十六个高等学校关于肃反的善后工作已经全部或基本结束。各校对个别误作反革命分子斗争的人，也在过去的原有斗争范围里向本人进行了道歉、恢复名誉。
    各校还根据群众意见纠正了工资级别以及福利费使用中的一些不合理现象。据北京大学、清华大学等二十六个学校统计，党员干部有六十九人自动降职降薪，六十一人退还了不合理的福利补助费。例如外国语学院已经宣布七名党员干部工资下降一级，自8月份起减薪。在改善伙食方面，清华大学、北京航空学院、北京艺术师范学院在提高伙食质量、减轻炊事人员的劳动强度方面也取得了成效。
    北京市各高等院校自5月初开展整风运动以来，群众通过座谈会、大字报、校刊等各种形式，向党组织提出了许多意见。各校中共党委为了有组织有步骤地解决问题，分门别类地成立了专门小组，负责研究处理这些意见。目前各校边整边改的工作，正在深入进行中。北京矿业学院由五十名教师、十多名行政干部组成十一个组，研究教研组职权、保密条例、师资培养、图书供应等问题，然后提出全面改进方案。
