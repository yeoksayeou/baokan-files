    Meeting in Northern Shaanxi
    General of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Xu Haidong
    I.
    In September 1934, the Red Twenty-Fifth Army was resting in the Liuan and Huoshan area of Western Anhui when Comrade Chen Jinxiu arrived in disguise from Eastern Hubei. He brought a letter from Comrade Zheng Weisan, Secretary of the Eastern Hubei District Committee. The letter said:
    "The Central Committee has sent Comrade Cheng Zihua with important instructions, who has arrived at my location. Please, upon receiving this letter, lead the Red Twenty-Fifth Army to Eastern Hubei at full speed."
    At the time, we had just fought a battle with the Forty-Seventh Division and suffered heavy casualties. Supplies were scarce, and we had not yet decided on our next course of action. Receiving this letter made us very happy. We immediately organized a rear guard and made arrangements for the work in Western Anhui. That evening, we led the troops on a westward expedition.
    From our starting point to Eastern Hubei, we had to pass through four enemy blockade lines, fighting and marching all the way. The first blockade line was between Shangcheng and Macheng, where the enemy's 109th Division blocked us. Our army fought a battle in Tangchi, annihilating four companies of the enemy, before opening the road and crossing the first blockade line. However, that same day, we encountered three regiments of the 107th Division at Daliushu. They thought we were a small force and adopted a strategy of dividing and encircling us. We turned the tables and encircled them, annihilating two regiments in a half-day of intense fighting. We suffered few casualties in these two battles, gaining an advantage and capturing many weapons. However, the troops were quite tired. When the guns fired, the soldiers were all like little tigers, but as soon as the battle ended, they were like little lambs, collapsing on the ground and falling asleep. I originally wanted to continue marching without stopping, but seeing how exhausted the soldiers were, I decided to rest for two hours, eat some dry rations, take a nap, and then continue.
    Passing through Xiyuji and advancing to the vicinity of Guangshan and Wangqiao, the troops were really unable to walk any further, and the grain bags on their shoulders were empty. If we continued like this, it would be difficult to break through that night, and since we were relatively far from the enemy, we made a temporary decision to rest here for half a day, preparing for a 130-mile forced march that night.
    After half a day of rest, the soldiers regained their spirits. At five o'clock in the afternoon, we set off again. I rode my horse, running back and forth, and the comrades were in high spirits, asking me:
    "Commander, will there be more battles ahead?"
    "Can we have another good fight?"
    Obviously, the comrades were very satisfied with the previous two battles. I said to everyone:
    "Comrades, be prepared. We are now like tigers entering a flock of sheep. There are four enemy divisions waiting for us ahead."
    When everyone heard that there were four divisions ahead, they were all invigorated. We marched all night without anyone falling behind. Before dawn, we had traveled over a hundred miles. In order to quickly shake off the enemy, I issued an order: "Run forward!"
    Dogs barked and guns fired everywhere as the troops hastened their pace on the dusty road. Large units of the enemy chased after us like a tide. However, they could not outrun us. In a little over an hour, we rushed twenty-five miles, temporarily shaking off the enemy behind us. At dawn, we passed through the enemy's fourth blockade line and had just settled down in Hushanzhai in Guangshan County when the enemy caught up again. I looked at the map. The terrain around Hushanzhai was very advantageous to us, and I decided to fight a big battle with the enemy here.
    Before twelve o'clock noon, four enemy divisions surrounded us from three sides. There were the 117th and 120th Divisions of the Northeast Army, and Liu Zhenhua's 64th and 65th Divisions. This was a big operation, probably because they wanted to "concentrate and annihilate" us.
    Of course, it was wishful thinking to annihilate us. However, the situation before us was serious. Our troops had been marching all night, and it was impossible to shake off four enemy divisions by relying on our legs alone. We could only take more aggressive action and fight them until they were completely crushed. We decided at the time that if we could eliminate one-third of the enemy in this battle, we could eliminate our worries and head towards Eastern Hubei without panic.
    The decisive battle unfolded here. My headquarters was set up on a high mountain south of Huzhai, from which I could see the entire battle line with a telescope. Red flags were flying everywhere, and fires were lit by the enemy everywhere. Initially, the enemy's arrogance was high. Under the cover of four aircraft, they shouted slogans and attacked the village held by our army. I had already given the order: Do not fight until the enemy is close, and do not counterattack until the enemy has been worn down to a certain extent.
    Our army stood fast, meeting the enemy's attacks again and again. From morning to dusk, the enemy failed to attack many times, and their spirit greatly reduced. Seeing that the time for a counterattack had come, I gave an order, and the various hilltops held by our army rushed down like a flood. The enemy could not withstand our counterattack and fled, retreating. All four divisions collapsed. The Northeast Army was our old "transport team." This time, they sent us more than a hundred machine guns. More than four thousand people were taken prisoner. A deputy regimental commander and two battalion commanders were found among the prisoners. There must have been many more officers who were not identified.
    Our army also suffered heavy casualties in this battle. Comrade Yao Zhixiu, Political Commissar of the Seventy-Fifth Division, was killed, and Commander Jin of the Seventy-Fourth Division was wounded. The number of troops decreased greatly, while the number of prisoners exceeded the number of our troops. We were eager to advance westward, and these prisoners became a problem. We held a meeting to discuss the matter. According to the spirit of the Central Committee's instructions to unite all possible forces in the country to resist Japan, we decided to release all the prisoners and ask them to become voluntary propagandists.
    After the prisoners were assembled, I spoke to them, explaining our party's policy of resisting Japan and saving the country and explaining the lenient policy of our army. The prisoners all nodded in agreement. When I announced their release, it immediately caused a sensation. Everyone was surprised and discussed it. One asked, "Is it really true?" Another said, "Are you not deceiving us?" Still others shook their heads, expressing disbelief.
    I said, "Don't worry. Communists have broad minds and will release you if they say so. We did not intend to fight you in the first place. Now is the time to unite to resist Japan, but you are clinging to us. I hope that you will not be soldiers for the counter-revolutionaries again after you go back. Even if some of you go back to be soldiers, you must be conscientious Chinese soldiers."
    Before I finished speaking, several captured soldiers started to reply. Some said, "The Red Army has released us. We will go home to farm and never be soldiers again." Others said, "People cannot be without conscience."
    After we released the prisoners, we settled the wounded, buried the fallen comrades, and set off again in the middle of the night. At this time, our only thought was to get to Eastern Hubei quickly and see the Central Committee's instructions as soon as possible.
    After a night of forced march, we arrived at Yinjiawan, north of Xuanhuadian, the next afternoon and met Comrade Zheng Weisan. He took out the instructions brought by Comrade Cheng Zihua from the Central Committee. The main points were: After four or five enemy "encirclement and suppression" campaigns, the Soviet area of Hubei, Henan, and Anhui had suffered great losses in manpower and materials, and the food supply was exhausted. The Red Twenty-Fifth Army should open up a new base area. The Central Committee would not make a decision on where to develop (because it did not understand the specific situation), but the responsible comrades of Hubei, Henan, and Anhui would choose according to the following conditions: First, the terrain is good; second, the enemy's forces are weak; third, the mass base is good.
    The Provincial Party Committee discussed the instructions of the Central Committee and decided to leave a small number of cadres and armed forces to persist in the old area. The Provincial Party Committee and the Red Twenty-Fifth Army would jointly embark on a westward expedition to open up a new base area.
    Our army rested in Hejiachong for two days and then began the Long March.

    II.
    In February 1935, our army fought hundreds of miles, passed through Laofoping, and crossed Tiangushan, entering Chaijiaguan. In the past six months, we had broken through countless enemy encirclements and won many victories. Just as Chairman Mao said: The Red Army is a propaganda team, and the Red Army is a seeding machine. We sowed the seeds of revolution in the vast land of Hubei, Henan, and Shaanxi. Wherever we went, we mobilized the masses and left cadres to develop guerrilla warfare.
    At the end of February, after we captured Zhashui, Yang Hucheng's Independent Second Brigade followed us again. In the battle of Jiujianfang, we annihilated five battalions of the Independent Second Brigade and captured Brigade Commander Zhang Hanming alive. In Gepai Town, Shaanxi, the Provincial Party Committee held an enlarged meeting, deciding to reorganize the Hubei-Henan-Anhui Provincial Party Committee into the Hubei-Henan-Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee. The meeting also decided that the future task of the Red Twenty-Fifth Army was to create the Hubei-Henan-Shaanxi Revolutionary Base Area.
    In early May, the enemy concentrated forty-one regiments (twenty-four regiments of eight divisions of the Northeast Army; six regiments of one division of Xiao Zhichu; eleven regiments of four brigades of Yang Hucheng) to launch the first "encirclement and suppression" campaign against the Hubei-Henan-Shaanxi Soviet Area. Because the enemy's forces were strong, we did not engage them head-on, adopting the strategy of "fatiguing the enemy first and then attacking." Leading the enemy by the nose, we marched eighty miles today, seventy miles tomorrow, and one hundred and twenty miles when we felt like it. The enemy followed behind us day and night like an armed parade. We both had two legs, but they couldn't outrun us. Our soldiers would jump and sing after marching eighty miles; the enemy would be exhausted after marching eighty miles.
    Initially, our soldiers did not understand this "fatiguing the enemy first and then attacking" strategy. In order to keep the secret, it was inconvenient to explain our army's operational plan. Some people made strange remarks and complained. Some said: "The enemy has one life, and we have one life. Why not fight them!" Some said: "Our Red Twenty-Fifth Army has never lost a battle. The enemy is following our butts without attacking. Are our guns for shooting rabbits?"
    One day, on the march, I saw a regimental commander and asked him: "How is the morale of the troops?" He said: "The comrades are a bit impatient and keep complaining about the leadership leading them to run." I asked him:
    "Are the cadres impatient?" The regimental commander hesitated for a while and mumbled: "Yes, a little bit." I could see that he also had this emotion, so I said to him: "It is understandable that the soldiers are impatient with running, but it is not right for the cadres to be impatient too." This made him feel a little embarrassed.
    "Tell the comrades to be patient," I said to him finally. "It doesn't matter if you run a few more days and get a few more blisters on your feet. When the time comes, no one will be allowed to run even if they want to."
    A few days later, we captured Jingziguan in Henan, wiping out an enemy battalion and capturing Xiao Zhichu's quartermaster alive. This was the enemy's supply station, and we seized a lot of flour, pork, sugar, and cloth. The soldiers were happy. Some said, "Now it's our turn to chase the enemy." Some said, "We won't be running anymore."
    The comrades were happy a little too soon. It wasn't time to settle down and fight yet. That night, we started another forced march. We walked one hundred and forty miles the first day and one hundred and twenty miles the second day, crossing mountains and rivers. The soldiers' strange remarks came again: "We just fought a small battle and then ran away again." "Where are we running to?"
    After four consecutive days of walking, we walked five hundred and sixty miles and entered the Heishanjie area in southern Shaanxi before settling down. I announced to the troops: "We are not running anymore. We are waiting for the enemy. Whichever unit arrives first, we will attack it."
    The large enemy force was left far behind, two hundred miles away. Three days later, Yang Hucheng's Independent Brigade arrived like a turtle crawling from afar. Those who arrive first must receive the "first prize." We lured them into Yuanjiagoukou and launched a counterattack, wiping out the entire brigade of Yang Hucheng. Brigade Commander Tang Sitong was also captured alive.
    The morale of the troops soared after this battle. One day, I went to a company and asked the soldiers: "How is it? Comrades! Are you still complaining about running?" Everyone replied:
    "Our running was not in vain." "Now we understand, running is not because we are afraid of the enemy."
    After a series of battles, the enemy's "encirclement and suppression" campaign failed.
    Our army had been fighting in the mountains for a long time, and we were facing difficulties with troop recruitment and supplies. In order to solve the problem of material supply and expand the troops and our army's political influence, the Provincial Party Committee decided to break out of the Qinling Mountains and approach Xi'an.
    At the end of June, our army set off from Yangjiaxie, crossed the Zhongnan Mountains, and marched a long distance, arriving in one day at a small town forty-five miles southwest of Xi'an. We captured a village head. We wanted to lure the enemy out of Xi'an and ambush them on the road. Political Commissar Wu Huanxian and I talked to the puppet village head and asked him to make a long-distance phone call to Xi'an to report an emergency and ask the enemy to come to our aid. The enemy in the city replied by phone that Commander Mao (Bingwen) and Commander Yu (Xuezhong)'s troops had already headed west and that there were no troops to send at present. This plan failed.
    We found a "Ta Kung Pao" newspaper on the ground of the township office, picked it up, and saw a piece of news on it: "After the Communist First and Fourth Front Armies met in northern Sichuan, they continued to flee north, with their advance troops reaching Songpan..."
    I took the newspaper to find Comrade Cheng Zihua. He was lying on a stretcher because he was ill. When he saw the newspaper, he said: "This is very likely. When I left the Central Committee, I heard about the northward movement."
    Because we only received the news from the enemy and there was no radio contact, it was impossible to know exactly where the Central Red Army was. However, we were sure that the First and Fourth Front Armies had moved north.
    In a place twenty miles west of Ziwu Town, the Provincial Party Committee held an emergency meeting and decided that the Red Twenty-Fifth Army should immediately embark on a westward expedition to contain the enemy's main force and welcome the Central Committee and the First and Fourth Front Armies. We were determined that even if all three thousand of us were sacrificed, we would still接应over the Central Committee and the First and Fourth Front Armies. At the meeting, some comrades asked: "What if we can't接应over the Central Committee and the enemy cuts off our retreat and we can't return to southern Shaanxi?" I said: "People are flexible. If we can't接应over the Central Committee, we will go to northern Shaanxi to join Comrade Liu Zhidan."
    This time we left the mountains, we recruited more than seven hundred new soldiers and acquired a lot of grain. We had the conditions for the Long March, and the troops marched westward for days.
    Our army marched for more than ten days, traveling hundreds of miles, passing through Zhouzhi, Luotuokou, Foping, and Xijiang, and arrived at Shuangshipu, a place where Gansu and Shaanxi meet. This is an ancient battlefield. It is said that Ma Su lost Jieting during the Three Kingdoms period. I and some comrades from the headquarters were discussing the story of Ma Su. Looking at the surrounding mountains, I joked: "It can be seen that Ma Su was too negligent. Such terrain is easy to defend and difficult to attack. How could he lose Jieting? It must be as the actors say, Ma Su violated Zhuge Liang's instructions and did not set up camp near the mountain and near the water." Political Commissar Wu Huanxian also joked: "Ma Su had no mass viewpoint and was detached from the masses."
    At dawn, a unit of our army encountered four companies of Hu Zongnan's Task Force. This was another gift sent to us. We didn't let one of them run away and wiped them all out. What was even more gratifying was that we also captured a major general advisor alive. His surname was He, but I forgot his name. The confession of this major general advisor further confirmed that the advance troops of our First and Fourth Front Armies had indeed crossed Songpan. He also revealed that Hu Zongnan's main force had all been transferred west to resist the northward Red Army, and that the rear guard was set up in Tianshui.
    Our army stayed in Shuangshipu for a day, held a meeting to commemorate the "August 1st" Army Day, and headed towards Tianshui early on the second day.
    Just as we captured the North Gate of Tianshui, an enemy brigade's reinforcement troops arrived. We abandoned our plan to capture Tianshui and turned to Fenghuang Mountain, Yanhezhen, forcibly crossed the Wei River, and captured Qinan for days. Then we forced Jingning, containing Mao Bingwen's main force.
    At that time, we put forward a loud slogan: "Advance actively, welcome the Central Committee, welcome the First and Fourth Front Armies." On the march, the comrades asked me one after another:
    "Where has the Central Committee arrived?"
    "Has Chairman Mao also come?"
    "When will we be able to see our brotherly troops?"
    Some comrades in our headquarters missed the Central Committee and Chairman Mao even more. Where were they now? Where exactly had they arrived, and when could we meet them? I didn't even know in my heart. I could only say to everyone:
    "Comrades, soon, we will see Chairman Mao in a few days."
    The morale of the troops was unprecedentedly high. In order to welcome the Central Committee and Chairman Mao, some people had large blisters and small blisters on the soles of their feet, but they didn't fall behind. When their shoes were broken, they walked barefoot; when they were hungry, they tightened their belts.
    Walking, fighting, fighting while walking. Political Commissar Wu Huanxian led the main force in the front, and I commanded the pursuit troops in the rear. From Longde to Liupanshan; from Wating to Pingliang, marching day and night. At Baishui Town, we defeated a brigade of Ma Hongbin (eliminating one or two battalions), and at Jingchuan we wiped out a regiment led by Ma Kaiji. Regiment Commander Ma Kaiji was killed, and more than four hundred people were captured alive.
    After the battle, the unfortunate news came that Comrade Wu Huanxian had been killed. This made me very sad. I couldn't eat or sleep for days. Comrade Wu Huanxian and I participated in the Huang'an Uprising in the autumn of 1927. We also persisted in the struggle in the Hubei-Henan-Anhui Soviet Area for many years. After traveling thousands of miles, he was my closest comrade-in-arms and most beloved comrade. A few days ago, he also said to me: "Haidong, we don't even know Chairman Mao when we see him, do we?" I smiled at the time and said: "I didn't know you before either, but don't I know you now?" Now, he has fallen, for the cause of the party, he has fallen. He will never see the Central Committee again, never see Chairman Mao, whom he misses more and more...
    We advanced westward from Jingchuan, forcing Chongxin, and contained the enemy on the southwest highway for seventeen days. We sent people to inquire every day, but we did not find out the definite news of the Central Committee and the First and Fourth Front Armies. Mao Bingwen sent eighty trucks of troops, combined with a part of Ma Hongbin's troops, to catch up from behind. Our army was fighting alone here, the terrain was unfamiliar, so we decided to go to northern Shaanxi to join Comrade Liu Zhidan.
    One night, it was very dark, and we forcibly crossed the Jing River and headed towards the Shaanxi-Gansu base area.

    III.
    One day, our army entered the edge of the Shaanxi-Gansu Soviet area—the ×shan area. This is the border between the White and Red areas. The troops had been walking for three days, crossing mountains and ridges, but they had not encountered a single village. The dry rations they were carrying were eaten, and the entire army had not eaten anything for two days. Many comrades fainted on the road from hunger. That afternoon, we suddenly found a flock of sheep, more than five hundred sheep. After some questioning, we found out that they were sheep dealers. We bargained with the sheep dealers and they finally sold us the sheep. Our troops began to eat mutton. There was no salt, and there were few pots. Those with washbasins used washbasins to cook, and those without washbasins cut the mutton into thin slices and roasted it on stone slabs; some held sheep legs and burned them on the fire. Fortunately, there were these sheep, which enabled us to persevere until we reached the Shaanxi-Gansu Soviet area.
    We began to enter the Soviet area. Because the troops had many machine guns, were dressed relatively neatly, and every soldier wore an octagonal hat with red collar badges, and spoke with a different accent, some of the masses did not know what kind of troops we were and fled one after another. However, when the masses learned that we were the Red Army, they were extraordinarily kind. The news spread quickly, and one day, Liu Jingfan (Comrade Liu Zhidan's younger brother) and Comrade Xi Zhongxun (Secretary of the Prefectural Committee) found us one after another. A mass meeting was held to welcome us. Coming to the Shaanxi-Gansu Soviet area, we felt like we were at home.
    After meeting with Comrade Xi Zhongxun, and after four consecutive days of marching, we arrived at Yongping Town. Here, I met with Comrade Liu Zhidan. Comrade Zhidan's attitude was calm, his clothes were very plain, and his speech was even more modest. It seemed that you would not think that he was a student of the fifth term of Whampoa Military Academy, he was just like a simple farmer.
    After the two armies joined forces, we immediately began to reorganize the troops. The Red Twenty-Fifth Army and the Northern Shaanxi Red Twenty-Sixth and Twenty-Seventh Armies were merged into the Fifteenth Army Corps. I was the commander of the army corps, and Comrade Liu Zhidan was the deputy commander of the army corps.
    September 18, 1935—National Humiliation Memorial Day. We held a founding meeting of the Red Fifteenth Army Corps in front of a cadre school southwest of Yongping Town. The two armies merged, and there were more than seven thousand people. They were truly elite troops with strong horses. The masses from dozens of miles around came to participate in the meeting; red flags fluttered in the meeting place, covering the sun. Many large-character slogans were pasted in the temporary sheds. On both sides of the rostrum were two large-character slogans:
    One: "Close Unity Between the Two Armies, Join Hands in Battle!"
    One: "Welcome the Central Committee, Welcome Chairman Mao!"
    At the meeting, comrades from the Central Delegation spoke, and Comrade Liu Zhidan and I also spoke.
    At this time, the enemy was beginning to launch the third "encirclement and suppression" campaign against the Shaanxi-Gansu Soviet area. In addition to the original four divisions of the enemy in northern Shaanxi, seven divisions of Zhang Xueliang's Northeast Army followed behind us. The day after the Red Fifteenth Army Corps was established, we discussed the operational plan to counter the "encirclement and suppression" campaign. After the two armies joined forces, the soldiers said: "We must fight a beautiful battle." The comrades in our headquarters also thought the same: we must fire the first shot. When we started the discussion, everyone looked at the map and thought silently.
    Comrade Liu Zhidan said to me:
    "Comrade Haidong, please speak first."
    Comrade Zhidan was more familiar with the situation in northern Shaanxi than I was. I said to him: "Please give more suggestions. You are an old Shaanxi."
    Comrade Zhidan was very cautious in command. He looked at the map, thought for a while, pointed his finger to the Mizhi and Hengshan area, and said in a discussing tone: "How about starting here? Here is a division of Gao Guizi and a division of Jin Jingyue. These two troops are local emperors of northern Shaanxi, and their combat effectiveness is not strong. If we annihilate them, our army can go out of Sanbian and develop the Soviet area."
    I considered Comrade Zhidan's opinion and felt that this was a relatively stable plan. It was more certain to eat these two local troops. However, at present, a large army is pressing down on the border. Eliminating these two troops would not have a major impact on the enemy. Besides, now is not the time to develop the Soviet area. Therefore, I suggested to hit the snake on the head and it would be best to attack the Northeast Army first. If one or two divisions of the Northeast Army's main force were defeated, it would bring about a major change in the war situation in northern Shaanxi.
    After I put forward my opinion, some comrades agreed, while others said: "It is of course satisfying to gnaw on hard bones, but the Northeast Army has strong combat effectiveness and is not easy to fight."
    I said: "The Northeast Army is my old opponent. I know its inside story. Although the upper-level officers are reactionary, the majority of the soldiers are unwilling to fight. There are many soldiers in their troops who were prisoners of the Red Twenty-Fifth Army."
    After some discussion, we reached a consensus: fight the hard ones, fight the Northeast Army.
    According to intelligence, the seven divisions of the Northeast Army were divided into two routes. One route was led by Wang Yizhe with three divisions, attacking us from Shaanxi. The 100th Division and the 129th Division had already arrived in Yan'an. The 100th Division left a battalion in Ganquan, and Army Commander Wang Yizhe led the army headquarters and another 107th Division to be stationed in Luochuan and Fu County. The remaining four divisions were in Gansu Province, led by Army Commander Dong Yingbin, and attacked us through Heshui. We decided to besiege Ganquan (where a battalion of the 100th Division was stationed), and lure the enemy from Yan'an to ambush them on the road.
    After three days of forced march, we bypassed Yan'an and arrived near Ganquan, ninety miles south of Yan'an. The troops rested west of Ganquan, and Comrade Zhidan and I led the cadres above the regimental level to the vicinity of Laushan, fifteen miles north of Ganquan. Looking at the terrain, it was very ideal: north of Ganquan, there is a highway leading to Yan'an. On both sides of the road are continuous mountains, sandwiching the Yan (an)-Gan (quan) highway in the middle like a pocket. Moreover, the mountains on both sides are densely wooded, which is convenient for ambush. If the enemy is let in, it is like putting a fox in a pocket.
    With the decision made. However, I considered that the enemy was cunning and that we must ambush in an area that they would not expect.
    After returning, Comrade Zhidan and I discussed the deployment in detail and decided to send a small unit to besiege Ganquan, while our army would ambush the reinforcements coming from Yan'an near Laushan. It was estimated that our army would surround Ganquan on the first day, the enemy in Yan'an might set out on the second day, and then they could enter the ambush area on the morning of the third day.
    The battle began according to plan. On the second day of the siege of Ganquan, Comrade Zhidan and I led the troops into the ambush area separately. Before setting off, we conducted strict organization of the troops participating in the ambush. Each person carried three days of dry rations, and after entering the ambush area, it was forbidden to make a fire or move around. No one was allowed to fire a gun unless the command gun was fired.
    My command post was set up under a large tree on the west mountain. After sending out the plainclothes personnel, I took out my telescope and squatted on the hilltop.
    But on the morning of the third day, there was no sign of the enemy. I was very anxious and thought to myself: He Lizhong (Commander of the enemy's 100th Division) has been cunning this time. Haven't you always been looking for us to fight? What's wrong today, could the news have leaked out!
    While I was guessing, the plainclothes personnel I sent out ran back. I thought to myself: Good, the enemy must be coming...
    "Here they come, here they come!" The plainclothes personnel ran to me, shouting happily.
    I leaned against a large tree and saw the enemy's advance troops through the telescope. It was originally estimated that if the enemy marched in two routes, two regiments would definitely drill in, and if they were pursued again, they could get more than two regiments. Who would have thought that the enemy would show up in four routes? It seems that He Lizhong is too bullying!
    The arrogant enemy, although prepared, miscalculated the area where our army might be ambushing. According to a staff officer who was later captured, He Lizhong, riding on his horse, passed the area where he expected us to be ambushing and said to the chief of staff: "Xu Haidong has many tricks, and I thought he would ambush me! Now he has left the dragon's pool and tiger's den." Just as he was saying this, my command gun fired, and machine guns and grenades immediately roared on both sides of the road. Thousands of enemies, like a hornet's nest poked with a stick, did not know where to run. One group of enemies attempted to seize the mountain, but was defeated; some attempted to break through forward, but the short-gun team I sent out blocked the road. The enemy began to resist stubbornly, refusing to surrender. Our soldiers shouted while fighting: "Surrender, you can't run away!" "Give up your weapons and you will be treated leniently!"
    Many soldiers in this enemy force had been our prisoners before. In this situation, they surrendered one after another.
    The battle was not completely over, and I walked down from the mountain of the command post. I was suddenly surrounded by prisoners. I thought they were going to riot, but no, many of the captured soldiers recognized me. Some said: "Commander, this is the second time I have surrendered to you!" Some said: "This is the third time I have surrendered." Others swore: "Commander, I didn't fire a single shot." They all confessed their "merits." I said: "All are good brothers, putting down your guns means we are friends."
    Some prisoners asked our soldiers: "How did you know we were coming?" Our comrades answered very well: "Our command post made a special invitation!"
    The battle lasted only six hours, and the entire 100th Division was wiped out. More than three thousand seven hundred people were taken prisoner, and Commander He Lizhong and the chief of staff were killed. The captured weapons were piled up like mountains.
    After the battle, we rested near Laushan. Commander Yang Sen of the 78th Division led a team to reconnoiter Yangquan, where they annihilated a battalion of the 107th Division.
    These two battles knocked down the enemy's "encirclement and suppression" arrogance. The enemy changed its tactics, adopting a "blockhouse policy" of advancing step by step. Our army took advantage of the victory to expand the results, stormed Yulin Bridge, and eliminated four more battalions of the 107th Division. This regiment was the main force of the Northeast Army, and the regimental commander, Gao Fuyuan (nicknamed "Gao Baobozi"), had once been the commander of Zhang Xueliang's guard battalion. I ordered the troops to find him, but after searching for a long time, they couldn't find him. I walked into the prisoner group, randomly pulled out a prisoner, and said to the short-gun team: "Take him away, he is Gao Fuyuan." The prisoner begged repeatedly: "I am not, I am not, I am a barber." As he said this, his mouth crooked to the side. It turned out that "Gao Baobozi" was right next to him. I said to "Gao Baobozi": "Gao Fuyuan, come out. Seeing how resolutely you fought, I thought I wouldn't be able to find you among the living people!" He had no choice but to plead guilty.
    After this battle, we received definite news about the Central Committee and the First and Fourth Front Armies. They were not far from us. The advance troops had already arrived in Wuqi Town. I thought: Chairman Mao is coming soon, let's fight another battle as a gift!

    IV.
    Where to start the next battle: the 100th Division was wiped out, five battalions of the 107th Division were defeated, and the two troops of Gao Guizi and Jin Jingyue in Mizhi abandoned Wayao Fort and fled north. There were not many enemies nearby. We discussed it and left the rear, and the troops immediately headed south.
    One day, I was planning to attack Zhangcunyi - this is a small town, there are not many enemies, and there are more than three hundred guns in the four surrounding forts, which is a great obstacle to us, and I decided to clean it up. The battle had just begun when suddenly seven fast horses ran from the rear of the army headquarters. Looking at it, it was a messenger sent by the army headquarters. Taking out the letter, it was written:
    Comrade Haidong,
        Chairman Mao will come to the headquarters this afternoon, please come back quickly upon seeing this letter.
                                    Cheng Zihua
    I immediately ordered the troops: stop the attack. I rode my red horse and whipped it back. I was so happy that I couldn't say it, I only hated that the horse was running slowly. In the end, it was slow or not, one hundred and thirty-five miles, with two mountains and three hours in the middle, and I rushed back.
    It was already early winter. When I rushed to the headquarters, I was covered in sweat. I had just washed my face when Chairman Mao and Commander Peng Dehuai came. There were four people in total, all wearing plain gray cotton clothes. Which one is Chairman Mao? I didn't recognize him. Comrade Cheng Zihua was from the Central Committee, he knew him. Just as he was introducing, Chairman Mao stretched out his hand and said kindly: "Is this Comrade Haidong? You have worked hard."
    I held Chairman Mao's hand with both hands, looking at his kind face for a long time, not knowing what to say. I had been looking forward to it for a long time, and finally I saw him.
    Chairman Mao asked about the situation of the troops, and asked the comrades what they were eating and wearing. After I answered, Chairman Mao took out an old map

    会师陕北
    中国人民解放军大将　徐海东
    一
    1934年9月，红二十五军正在皖西六安、霍山一带休整，陈锦秀同志化装从鄂东找来了。他带来了鄂东道委书记郑位三同志的信。信上说：
    “中央派程子华同志送来了重要指示，已到我处，请你们接信后，火速率领红二十五军到鄂东来。”
    当时，我们刚和四七师打了一仗，部队伤亡甚大，供给困难，对下一步行动还没决定，接到此信，心中非常高兴。我们随即组织了一个后方留守处，布置了皖西的工作，当晚，就率队出发西征。
    从出发地到鄂东，要通过敌人四道封锁线，我们一路打，一路走。第一道封锁线在商城到麻城，敌一○九师在此堵击我们。我军在汤池打了一仗，歼灭了敌人四个连，才把道路打开，越过了第一道封锁线。可是，当天又在大柳树碰上一○七师三个团，他们以为我们是小部队，采取分兵合围的办法阻击我们，我们来了个分割包围，激战半日，将敌人两个团全部歼灭。这两仗，我们伤亡不大，打的是便宜仗，缴获武器很多。可是，部队相当疲劳。枪响的时候，战士们个个都像小老虎，战斗一结束，都像小绵羊似的，一个个往地上一躺就睡着了。我本来想一刻不停继续前进，看看战士累的不行，决定休息两个钟头，吃点干粮打个盹再走。
    通过西余集进至光山、汪桥附近时，部队实在走不动了，肩膀上的粮袋也空了，如果再这样走下去，今晚很难冲过去。因为离敌人比较远，临时决定，在这儿休息半天；准备当晚来它一个一百三十里路的急行军。
    半天休息过后，战士们都有了精神，下午五点钟，我们又出发了。我骑着马，前后跑着，同志们情绪很高，纷纷问我：
    “军长，前面还有仗打吗？”
    “能不能再干一个痛快的？”
    显然，同志们对前两仗很满意。我向大家说：
  “同志们，你们准备着吧，现在我们如同老虎钻进了羊群，前边还有敌人四个师等着我们哩。”
    大家听说前面有四个师，个个精神百倍。行军一夜，没有掉队的。拂晓前，我们走出了一百里之外，为了迅速把敌人摆脱开，我传下了一道命令：“跑步前进！”
    四处狗叫枪响，部队在尘土飞扬的道路上加紧脚步跑着，大队的敌人，像潮水似的，尾追着我们。可是，他们跑不过我们，一个多钟头，我们冲出了二十五里，暂时把后尾的敌人甩脱开。天亮，我们通过了敌人的第四道封锁线，刚刚在光山县的胡山寨住下，敌人又追赶上来。我看了一下地图，胡山寨一带地势对我们很有利，决定在这里跟敌人大干一场。
    中午十二点以前，敌人的四个师从三面包围上来。有东北军一一七师、一二○师；刘镇华的六四师、六五师，好大的行动，大概他们想来一个“聚而歼之”。
    要歼灭我们，当然是妄想。可是，摆在面前的情况，是严重的，我们的部队已经走了整整一夜，再靠两条腿把敌人四个师摆脱掉，那是不可能的。只有采取更积极的行动，打，打它个稀里华啦。我们当时研究，这一仗如果能把敌人干掉三分之一，后顾之忧就能解除，便可以不慌不忙地走向鄂东。
    决定性的一仗，在这里展开了。我的指挥部，设在胡寨南边的高山上，用望远镜，可以看到整个战线。到处是红旗飘扬，到处是敌人点起的烈火。开始，敌人的气焰很高，四架飞机掩护着，喊着杀声向我军扼守的寨子攻击。我早有命令：敌人不到跟前不打，不把敌人消耗到一定程度，不反击。
    我军坚守阵地，一次又一次迎接着敌人的进攻。从上午，打到黄昏，敌人多次进攻不成，锐气大减，我看反击的时机到了，一声令下，我军扼守的各个山头，像洪水似的涌了下去。敌人吃不住我们的反击，跑的跑，退的退，四个师全部垮了。东北军是我们的老“运输队”，这一次，光机枪就给我们送了一百多挺。四千多人作了俘虏。从俘虏当中查出有一个团副，两个营长。没查出的官，想必还有不少。
    这次战斗，我军伤亡也比较大，七五师政委姚志修同志牺牲，七四师金师长负伤。部队减员大，而俘掳的人数超过了我们部队的人数，我们要急于西进，这些俘虏成了麻烦。我们开会研究了一番，根据中央指示的精神：团结国内一切可能团结的力量，抵抗日本。我们决定，把俘虏全部释放，要他们去做义务宣传员。
    俘虏集合起来之后，我给他们讲了话，宣传了我们党抗日救国的方针，解释了我军的宽大政策。俘虏兵听了个个点头。当我一宣布释放他们的时候，顿时轰动起来。个个惊奇，纷纷议论。这个问：“可是真的？”那个说：“你们不骗人吧！”还有的直摇头，表示不相信。
    我说：“你们放心吧，共产党人胸怀宽大，说放就放。我们本来不打算和你们打，现在是团结抗日的时候，可是你们却叮住我们不放；希望你们回去后不要再替反革命当兵，即是你们有的人再去当兵，也要做一个有良心的中国士兵。”
    我的话没说完，有几个被俘的士兵纷纷答起话来。有的说：“红军放了我们，回家种地去，再不当兵了。”有的说：“人不能不要良心。”
    我们把俘虏放了以后，当晚把伤员安插好，埋葬了牺牲的同志，半夜又出发了。这时候，我们唯一的想法，很快到鄂东，早一天看到中央的指示。
    经过连夜的急行军，第二天下午，到了宣化店以北的殷家湾，见到了郑位三同志。他拿出中央派程子华同志带来的指示，内容的大意是：鄂豫皖苏区经过敌人四、五次“围剿”，人力、物力损失甚大，粮食已空，红二十五军应开辟新的根据地。向哪里发展，中央不做决定（因不了解具体情况），由鄂豫皖负责同志根据以下条件选择：第一，地形好；第二，敌人力量薄弱；第三，群众条件好。
    省委讨论了中央的指示，决定留一小部分干部和武装坚持老区，省委和红二十五军一同西征，去开辟新的根据地。
    我军在何家冲休整了两天，便开始长征了。
    二
    1935年2月，我军转战数百里，又经老佛坪，翻越天谷山，进入柴家关。在这半年之中，我们冲破了敌人无数次围剿，打了许多胜仗，正像毛主席说的：红军是宣传队，红军是播种机。在鄂、豫、陕广大的土地上，我们撒下了革命的种子。每到一处，我们即发动群众，留下干部发展游击战争。
    2月底，我们打下柞水之后，杨虎城的独立二旅，又尾追上来。九间房一战，我们歼了独二旅的五个营，活捉了旅长张汉明。在陕西葛牌镇，省委召开了扩大会议，决定改组鄂豫皖省委为鄂豫陕省委。会议并决定：红二十五军今后的任务是：创造鄂豫陕革命根据地。
    5月初，敌人集中了四十一个团的兵力（东北军八个师二十四个团；萧之楚一个师六个团；杨虎城四个旅十一个团），向鄂豫陕苏区发动了第一次“围剿”。因敌人的兵力强大，我们不和它硬干，采取“先疲后打”的方针。牵着敌人的鼻子，今天走八十里，明天走七十里，高了兴来它个一百二。敌人像武装大游行似的，日夜跟在我们后边撵。同样是两条腿，可是他们赛不过我们。我们的战士，行军八十里住下，又跳又唱；敌人走八十里就累熊了。
    开始，我们的战士不了解这种“先疲后打”的方针，为了保守秘密，我军的作战方针又不便讲，有的就讲怪话，发牢骚。有的说：“敌人一条命，我们命一条，为什么不和他们拚！”有的说：“我们红二十五军从来没打过败仗，敌人跟着屁股不打，我们的枪是打兔子的？”
    一天，行军路上，我见了一个团的团长，就问他：“部队情绪怎么样？”他说：“同志们有些不耐烦了，老埋怨领导上带着跑。”我问他：
  “干部有没有不耐烦？”团长犹豫了一会，吱吱唔唔地说：“有，也有一点。”我看得出他也有这种情绪，便向他说：“战士跑得不耐烦了，可以原谅，干部要是也不耐烦可不对头”。说得他有些难为情。
    “告诉同志们，耐心些，”我最后向他说：“多跑几天路，脚上多磨几个泡，算不得什么，跑到一定的时候，谁想跑也不让他跑了。”
    不几天，我们打下了河南的荆紫关，消灭了敌人一个营，活捉了萧之楚的军需长。这里是敌人的兵站，缴获了很多的白面、猪肉、白糖和布匹，战士们高兴起来。有的说：“现在到了我们撵敌人的时候了。”有的说：“这回不再走了。”
    同志们高兴得早了点，还不到住下打的时候。当夜，我们又开始了急行军。第一天走了一百四十里，第二天又走了一百二十里，翻山过水，战士们的怪话又来了：“刚打了个小仗，又跑开了”，“咱们到底跑到哪里去？”
    接连走了四天，走出了五百六十里，进入了陕南黑山街一带，这才住下。我便向部队宣布：“现在不走了，等着敌人，哪一股先到，就打哪一股。”
    大兵团的敌人，被我们远远的甩在二百里之外。三天后，杨虎城的独立旅，像乌龟爬行似的，远道赶来。先来者必领“头赏”，我们把它引入袁家沟口，一个反扑打下去，把杨虎城这个旅全部歼灭。旅长唐嗣桐也被活捉了。
    这仗一打，部队情绪高涨起来。一天，我到一个连里去，问战士们：“怎么样啊？同志们！还埋怨跑路么？”大家纷纷回答说：
    “咱们的路没白跑”“现在明白了，跑，不是怕敌人。”
    经过一连串的战斗，敌人的“围剿”失败了。
    我军长期转战于山区，兵源、给养发生了困难。为了解决物资供应问题和扩充部队、扩大我军的政治影响，省委决定：打出秦岭，逼近西安。
    6月底，我军从杨家斜出发，跨过终南山，长途跋涉，一天到了西安西南四十五里路的一个小镇，捉住了一个乡长。我们想把西安的敌人调出来，拦路打它个埋伏。我和政委吴焕先同志跟伪乡长谈话，叫他向西安挂长途电话告急，要敌人前来增援。城里敌人回电话说：毛（炳文）军长、于（学忠）军长的部队已向西开，目前无兵可派。此计没成。
    我们从乡公所地上发现了一张“大公报”，拾起来看，上面有一条消息：“共军一、四方面军在川北会师后，继续向北逃窜，先头部队达到松潘……”。
    我拿着报纸去找程子华同志。他生病躺在担架上，看见报纸，便说：“这很可能，我离开中央的时候，就听到北上的事。”
    因为只是从敌人方面得到的消息，又无电台联络，中央红军到底到了哪里，无法知道。但是，我们确信，一、四方面军是北上了。
    在子午镇西二十里一个地方，省委召开了紧急会议，决定：红二十五军立刻西征，牵制敌人的主力，迎接中央，迎接一、四方面军。我们下定决心：就是我们这三千多人都牺牲了，也要把中央和一、四方面军接应过来。会上，有的同志提出：“接不到中央敌人切断了后路回不到陕南怎么办？”我说：“人是活的，接不到中央，我们奔陕北去找刘志丹同志会合。”
    这次出山，我们扩充了七百多名新兵，搞了很多粮食。长征有了条件，连日部队向西挺进。
    我军行走了十多天，行程数百里，经过盩厔、骆驼口、佛坪、西江，到达了甘肃和陕西交界的地方双石铺。这是古战场，据说，三国时代马谡失街亭就在此地。我和指挥部的一些同志，谈论着马谡的故事。望着这附近的群山要岭，我还开玩笑说：“可见马谡太麻痹大意，这样的地势，易守不易攻，怎能把街亭失掉呢？想必真的像唱戏人说的那样，马谡违背了诸葛亮的旨意，没靠山近水扎营。”政委吴焕先同志还取笑说：“马谡没有群众观点，脱离群众。”
    拂晓，我军一支部队，和胡宗南的别动队四个连遭遇了。这又是送上门的礼物，我们一个没放跑，全部歼灭了。更可喜的是，还活捉了一个少将参议。他姓何，名子忘了。从这位少将的口供里，更加证实我一、四方面军先头部队确实越过了松潘。他还供出：胡宗南的主力部队已经全部西调去抗击北上的红军，后方留守处设在天水。
    我军在双石铺停留了一天，开会纪念了“八一”建军节，二号一早，就向天水挺进。
    刚打下天水北关，敌人一个旅的增援部队到了，我们放弃了攻占天水的计划，连日转向凤凰山、沿何镇，强渡渭水，攻占了秦安。然后威逼静宁，牵制毛炳文的主力。
    当时，我们提出一个响亮的口号：“积极前进，迎接中央，迎接一、四方面军。”行军的路上，同志们纷纷问我：
    “中央到了哪里？”
    “毛主席也来了吗？”
    “咱们什么时候能见到兄弟部队？”
    我们指挥部的一些同志，更想念中央，想念毛主席。他们现在哪里？到底到了什么地方，哪一天能会面，自己心里也没数。我只好向大家说：
  “同志们，快啦，不几天就会见到毛主席了。”
    部队的情绪，真是空前的高涨。为了迎接中央，迎接毛主席，有的人脚底板上大泡加小泡，也没有掉队的。鞋子破了，赤着脚走，肚子饿了，紧紧裤带。
    走啊，打啊，边打边走。政委吴焕先同志在前头领着大队，我在后面指挥打敌人的追兵。从隆德转战到六盘山；从瓦亭到平凉，日夜行军。在白水镇打垮马鸿宾一个旅（消灭一个多营），在泾川干掉马开基带领的一个团，团长马开基被打死，活捉了四百多人。
    战斗结束后，传来了不幸的消息，吴焕先同志牺牲了。这使我非常悲伤，连着好几天吃不下饭，睡不着觉。我和吴焕先同志是1927年秋参加黄安暴动的，在鄂豫皖苏区，我们又一块坚持斗争好多年，转战万里，他是我最亲密的战友，最可爱的同志。前些天，他还向我说：“海东，见了毛主席，咱们还不认识呢？”我当时还笑着说：“我以前也不认识你，现在不是认识了吗？”现在，他倒下了，为党的事业，他倒下了。他，再也见不到中央，见不到他日益想念的毛主席了。……
    我们从泾川西进，威逼崇信，在西南公路牵制敌人十七天之久，天天派人打听，也没打听着中央和一、四方面军的确实消息。毛炳文派了八十辆汽车的部队，配合马鸿宾的一部分，从背后赶来。我军在此孤军作战，地形不熟，便决定到陕北找刘志丹同志会合。
    一天夜晚，天很黑，我们强渡泾水，开向陕北根据地。
    三
    一天，我军进入了陕北苏区的边沿——×山一带，这里是白区和红区交界的地方。部队翻山越岭走了三天，也没碰到一个村庄。背的干粮吃光了，全军两天没吃上东西，许多同志饿得昏倒在路上。这天下午，忽然发现一个羊群，有五百多只羊。一盘问，是羊贩子，我们和贩羊的人好商量一番，他才把羊卖给我们。我们的部队就吃起羊肉来。没有盐，锅也少，有脸盆的用脸盆煮，没有脸盆的，把羊肉切成薄片片，放在石板上烤；有的拿着羊腿放在火上烧。幸亏了这群羊，才使我们坚持到了陕北苏区。
    我们开始进入苏区，因为部队机枪多，穿的又比较齐整，每个战士都戴的八角帽，领头上还缀着红领章，说话口音不对，有些群众不知我们是什么队伍，纷纷逃走。可是，当群众知道我们是红军时，就分外亲切。消息传的很快，一天，刘景范（刘志丹同志的弟弟）、习仲勋同志（地委书记）先后找到了我们。召开了群众大会欢迎我们。来到陕北苏区，我们好像到了家一样。
    和习仲勋同志会面后，又经过连续四天的行军，到达了永坪镇。在这里，我和刘志丹同志会面了。志丹同志态度沉静，穿的十分朴素，讲话更为谦虚。看来，你想不出他会是黄埔五期的学生，就像是一个纯朴的农民。
    两军会合之后，我们即着手改编部队。红二十五军和陕北红二十六、二十七军合编为十五军团，我是军团长，刘志丹同志是副军团长。
    1935年9月18日——国耻纪念日。我们在永坪西南一个干部学校门前操场上，举行了红十五军团成立大会，两军合一，七千多人，真是人精马壮。周围几十里以外的群众，都赶来参加了大会；会场上红旗飘扬，遮日盖天。许许多多的大字标语，贴在临时搭起的席棚里。主席台的两旁，是两张大字标语：
    一是：“两军亲密团结，携手作战！”
    一是：“迎接中央，迎接毛主席！”
    会上，中央代表团的同志讲了话，刘志丹同志和我也讲了话。
    此时，敌人正开始发动对陕北苏区的第三次“围剿”。除了陕北原有的敌人四个师外，东北军张学良的七个师也跟着我们的后面赶来。红十五军团成立的第二天，我们就商讨反“围剿”的作战计划。两军会合之后，战士们说：“一定要打个漂亮仗。”我们指挥部的同志们，也是这样想：一定打响第一炮。开始讨论了，大家都望着地图，默默地思考。
    刘志丹同志向我说：
    “海东同志，还是你先发言吧。”
    志丹同志对陕北的情况比我熟。我向他说：“还是你多提些意见。你是老陕北。”
    志丹同志在指挥上很慎重。他望着地图，考虑了一会，把手指向米脂、横山一带，用一种商讨的口气说：“咱们在这里下手如何？这里是高桂滋一个师，金井岳一个师，这两股部队是陕北的土皇帝，战斗力不强，歼灭了他们，我军可以打出三边，发展苏区。”
    我考虑着志丹同志的意见，觉得这是一个比较稳当的计划，吃掉这两个乡土部队，把握大一些。可是，目前大兵压境，消灭这两个部队，对敌人的打击不重。再说，现在不是发展苏区的时候。因此，我建议打蛇打头，最好先打东北军。如果把东北军的主力搞垮一两个师，会使陕北战局发生重大变化。
    我把意见提出后，有的同志同意，有的同志说：“啃硬骨头当然过瘾，可是，东北军战斗力强，不易打。”
    我说：“东北军是我的老对头，我知道它的底细，虽然上层军官反动，可是广大士兵不愿意打仗，他们部队里，有很多士兵当过红二十五军的俘虏。”
    经过一番讨论，我们的意见取得了一致：打硬的，打东北军。
    据情报：东北军七个师分成两路，一路是王以哲率领三个师，从陕西向我进攻，一○○师、一二九师已经到了延安，一○○师留一个营在甘泉，军长王以哲带军部和另一○七师驻守洛川、鄜县，其余四个师在甘肃境内由军长董英斌带领经合水向我进攻。我们决定：围攻甘泉，（这里驻守一○○师一个营）调动延安的敌人，拦路打它个埋伏。
    经过三天的急行军，我们绕过延安，到达了延安南九十里的甘泉附近。部队在甘泉以西休息，我和志丹同志带着团以上的干部，来到了甘泉北十五里的劳山附近。一看地形，非常理想：甘泉北，是一条通向延安的公路，路两旁是连绵起伏的山岭，把延（安）甘（泉）公路夹在当中像是一条口袋。而且，两边山上树木密茂，便于埋伏。如果把敌人放进来，真如同把狐狸装进口袋里。
    决心下定了。但是，我考虑到敌人刁滑，必须埋伏在他们意想不到的地区。
    回来后，我和志丹等同志详细地商讨了部署，决定派一部分小部队围攻甘泉，我军在劳山附近打延安来的援兵。估计：我军第一天包围甘泉，第二天延安敌人可能起身，那么，第三天上午即可进入埋伏地区。
    战斗按着计划开始了。围攻甘泉的第二天，我和志丹同志分头带领部队，进入了埋伏区。出发前，对参加埋伏的部队进行了严密的组织，每人携带三天的干粮，进入埋伏地区后，不准生火，不准走动。指挥枪不响，任何人不得开枪。
    我的指挥所，设在西山上一棵大树下。把便衣派出去后，我拿着望远镜，蹲在山头上。
    等到第三天上午，却不见敌人的影子，我心里好急，暗暗想：贺立中（敌一○○师师长）这回耍滑头了，你不是一向找着我们打吗？今天怎么了，莫非走漏了风声！
    正在猜想的功夫，派出去的便衣跑回来了。我心想：好了，一定是敌人来了。……
    “来了，来了！”便衣跑到我跟前，高兴地叫着。
    我贴在一棵大树下，从望远镜里，看见敌人的先头部队。原来估计，敌人要是两路行军，必会有两个团钻进来，如果再追击一下，可以搞到他两个多团。谁想，敌人一露头，是四路前进。看来，贺立中太欺负人了！
    骄横的敌人，虽有防备，但是，他们把我军可能埋伏的地区估计错了。据后来抓住的一个参谋说，贺立中骑在马上，过了他预计我们埋伏的地区后，向参谋长说：“徐海东鬼计多端，我当他会打我个埋伏呢！现在出了龙潭虎穴”。就在他正说这话的功夫，我的指挥枪响了，道路两旁，机枪、手榴弹，立刻混响起来。几千敌人，像黄蜂窝挨了一棍，不知向哪里跑好。有一股敌人企图抢夺山头，被打垮了；有的企图往前突围，我派出去的短枪团把路给堵住了。敌人开始顽抗，不肯缴枪，我们的战士连打带喊话：“缴枪吧，你们跑不出去了！”“放下武器一律优待！”
    敌人这个部队里，有好多士兵曾经做过我们的俘虏，在此情况下，纷纷缴了械。
    战斗还没完全结束，我从指挥部的山上走下去。一下被俘虏围住了。我当他们要暴动呢，不是，原来很多被俘的兵士认识我。有的说：“军长，我这是第二次向你们缴枪了！”有的说：“我是第三次缴枪了。”还有的发誓说：“军长，我一枪没放。”他们纷纷表白自己的“功绩”。我说：“都是好弟兄，放下枪就是朋友。”
    有的俘虏问我们的战士：“你们怎么知道我们要来？”我们同志回答的很好：“我们指挥部特别邀请?！”
    战斗只有六个多钟头，一○○师全部被歼。三千七百多人做了俘虏，师长贺立中和参谋长被打死。缴获的武器堆积如山。
    战斗结束后，我们在劳山附近休整。七八师师长杨森同志带队去杨泉侦察，又在那里歼灭了一○七师一个营。
    这两仗，把敌人“围剿”的气焰打下去了。敌人改变了战术，采取步步为营的“碉堡政策”。我军乘胜扩大战果，强攻榆林桥，又消灭了一○七师四个营。这个团是东北军的主力，团长高福源（外号叫“高包脖子”）曾经当过张学良警卫营的营长。我命令部队把他查出来，可是查了半天，没查着。我走到俘虏群里，随便拉出一个俘虏，向短枪队说：“把他带走，他就是高福源。”这个俘虏连声求告说：“我不是，我不是，我是理发工人。”说着嘴向旁边一歪，原来，“高包脖子”就在旁边。我向“高包脖子”说：“高福源，你出来吧，看你打的那么坚决，我当在活人当中找不到你呢！”他只得低头认罪。
    打完这仗，我们得到了中央和一、四方面军确实的消息，他们离我们不远了。先头部队已经到了吴旗镇。我想：毛主席快到了，再打它一仗，作为见面礼！
    四
    下一仗从哪里下手呢：一○○师搞掉了，一○七师搞垮了五个营，米脂方面高桂滋、金井岳两支部队放弃了瓦窑堡向北逃走了，附近敌人不多了。我们讨论了一番，把后方留下，部队立刻南下。
    一天，我正计划攻打张村驿——这是个小镇，敌人不多，周围四个围子有三百多条枪，因对我们妨碍甚大，我决定把它收拾掉。战斗刚开始，忽然从军团部后方跑来了七匹快马。一看，是军团部派来的通讯员。拿出信一看，写的是：
    海东同志，
        毛主席今下午到司令部来，请见信速回。
                                    程子华
    我立刻命令部队：停止攻击。骑上我那匹枣红马，加鞭就往回奔。心里说不出有多么高兴，只嫌马跑的慢。到底慢不慢，一百三十五里，当中还有两座山，三个钟头就赶到了。
    已经是初冬了，赶到司令部我满身大汗，刚洗了一把脸，毛主席和彭德怀司令员来了。一块来的，共四个人，都穿着朴素的灰棉衣。哪一位是毛主席？不认识。程子华同志是中央来的，他认识，正当他介绍的时候，毛主席伸出手，亲切地说：“是海东同志吧，你们辛苦了。”
    我用两只手把毛主席的手握住，久久地望着他那可亲的面孔，不知说什么好。盼望了好久，总算见着了。
    毛主席问了部队的情况，问同志们吃的、穿的。我回答之后，毛主席拿出一份三十万分之一的旧地图，问我：
    “陕北的三次反‘围剿’怎么样了？”
    我把敌人的情况扼要地作了报告。毛主席看着地图，问我：
    “海东同志，你看下一步怎么打？”
    我讲出了自己的意见，毛主席折起地图，亲切地说：
    “好吧，先按你的部署，把张村驿打下来，咱们再共同考虑下一步的行动。”
    我们一块吃了饭。我动身回前线的时候，毛主席说：“给你一部电台带着。”
    这几年，我们的交通联络都是原始工具，哪里用过电台？我向毛主席说：
    “我不会用它。”
    “不要你自己动手，”毛主席笑着说：“需要联络，你向电台工作同志说，他们会使用它。”
    当晚，我离开毛主席回前方的时候，骑在马上加鞭飞奔，感到全身是力量。有中央首长的直接领导，我对粉碎敌人的“围剿”更加充满了信心。
    回到前方，我立刻将中央领导同志和毛主席到来的消息传达下去，转告了毛主席对大家的问候，部队的情绪沸腾起来。这个问我：“毛主席什么时候来这里？”那个问：“哪天能看见毛主席？”我说：“咱们把张村驿打下，我领大家一块去见毛主席！”
    这几句话，比什么口号都有鼓动力。战士们喊着口号“打下张村驿，去见毛主席！”一鼓作气，爬上了张村驿两丈多高的围墙。接着把张村驿附近的据点都打开了，缴获了很多粮食。
    战斗结束后，我向毛主席发了电报，报告了胜利。这是我做红军指挥员以来，发的第一封电报。当天，毛主席回了电报，说我们打得好，并向参战的同志问候。
    就在这次战斗之后，一军团、十五军团会师了，毛主席、周恩来副主席、彭德怀司令员亲自指挥陕北会师的各路大军，打了直罗镇，歼灭一○九师全部和一○六师一个团。彻底粉碎了敌人对陕北苏区的第三次“围剿”。
