Dragon Smoke Iron Mine worker Zhou Liyuan's oral account, Xinhua News Agency reporter Li Jilu photography

    My name is Zhou Liyuan. I started working at the Longyan Iron Mine in 1938. Before liberation, I was a mining worker, and my eldest and second sons worked as laborers in the mine. Now, my eldest son is the section chief of a work area, my second son is the leader of a blasting team, my third son is also involved in ore transportation, and my fourth and youngest sons are studying in junior high and elementary school, respectively. The affairs of the household are managed by my wife and my third daughter-in-law, and our family of thirteen lives a happy life.

    Some right-wing elements insist that the people's lives have not improved since liberation, which is simply lying through their teeth.

    Take me for example. Before liberation, the money earned by my father and sons working in the mine was not enough for the three of us to eat. We also relied on my wife to dig wild vegetables and barely survive on half-bran, half-vegetables. We had no quilts to cover ourselves with and no clothes to wear. When going down the mine, we had to use newspapers and cement sack paper to cover our bodies, and we went barefoot to move the ore. After a day of exhaustion in the mine, we couldn't even go home, and we slept on the mountain road after coming out of the tunnel. At that time, our workers were skin and bones, and we didn't even have the energy to wash our faces every day. Going into the tunnel would get us covered in red iron powder, and we ate red sorghum, so we pooped red. People called us "hungry ghosts" and "old three reds." And look at the working conditions! At that time, there wasn't even a water pump or ventilator in the tunnel, the wires had no insulation, and we used hand drills for dry drilling. There were only three support workers in a large alleyway, and we were constantly threatened by tunnel collapses, electrocution, silicosis, and various other forms of death.

    Currently, four of us are participating in production, with an average monthly income of over 300 yuan. The mine has distributed four rooms to us. My older sons have all married, and everyone in the family has two sets of new clothes to wear, and everyone has a new quilt on their bed. Our life today is truly heaven and earth compared to before liberation. (Image attached)

    I am now fifty-seven years old, and the leaders take care of me, not asking me to engage in mining work underground anymore, but just repairing wind drills.

    Before liberation, we lived in narrow, damp caves, which were smelly and filthy, with flies and mosquitoes crawling everywhere. Now, this place is a new workers' dormitory area, with a dining hall, bathroom, hospital, club, elementary school, and nursery.

    This is my eldest son, Zhou Wanshan (right), and Comrade Zhang Ming, a member of the Communist Youth League tunneling team he leads, working together. This Communist Youth League tunneling team has exceeded its 1957 production target by 120 days ahead of schedule and is now working on the 1958 tasks.

    My second son went to support the Daye Iron Mine three years ago, working as a blasting team leader. He got married in Daye and has two children. He came back to see me a few days ago. After I got off work, I took him and my little grandson to the garden to see the flowers.

    We receive scientific healthcare and free medical treatment. This is my third son, Zhou Wanjiang, taking a bath in the "sun lamp bathroom" after getting off work.

    我这一辈子
    龙烟铁矿工人周立元口述　新华社记者  李基禄摄影
    我叫周立元。1938年就到龙烟铁矿工作。解放以前，我是采掘工，我的大儿子和二儿子在矿上当小工。现在，大儿子当了工区区长，二儿子当了爆破组长，三儿子也参加了运矿工作，四儿子和小儿子分别在初中和高小读书。家里边的事由我的老伴和我的三儿媳妇操理，我们一家十三口过着幸福的生活。
    有些右派分子硬说解放以来人民的生活没有改善，这真是瞪着眼睛说瞎话。
    就拿我来说吧。解放前，我父子三人在矿上工作赚的钱，都不够我们三个人吃，还靠老伴挖野菜，半糠半菜地度命。我们没有被子盖，也没有衣服穿，下矿井的时候，只好用报纸和洋灰口袋纸遮体，光着脚去搬矿石。在井下累了一天连家都回不去，出了坑道就睡在山路上。那时候，我们工人的瘦皮包骨头，每天连洗脸的情绪都没有。进坑道弄得一身红铁粉，吃的是红高粮，拉的红屎，人家都叫我们“饿鬼”、“老三红”。再看看工作条件吧！那时坑道里连一台抽水机和通风机都没有，电线没有包皮，用手打干眼，一条大巷井里只有三个支柱工，我们时刻受着坑道塌顶、过电、矽肺病等多种多样的死亡威胁。
    目前，我们四个人参加了生产，平均每月收入三百多元。矿上分给我们四间房子。我的大一点的儿子都娶了媳妇，全家老小每个人都有两套新衣服穿，每个人的床上都有新被子。我们今天的生活和解放前比，真是一个天堂一个地狱。（附图片）
    我现在已经五十七岁了，领导上照顾我，不叫我再从事坑下的采掘工作，只修理修理风钻。
    解放前我们住在狭小、潮湿的山洞里，又臭又秽，苍蝇蚊子到处爬；现在这里已经是一片新的工人宿舍，其中有食堂、浴室、医院、俱乐部、小学校、托儿所。
    这是我大儿子周万山（右）和他所领导的共青团掘进队队员张明同志在一块劳动。这个共青团掘进队已超额一百二十天提前完成了1957年的生产任务，现在正干1958年的工作。
    我的二儿子三年前去支援大冶铁矿，当爆破组长，在大冶结了婚，生了两个小孩子。前些日子他回来看我。我下班后带着他和小孙子到花园里去看花。
    我们得到科学保健和免费医疗，这是我三儿子周万江下班后在“太阳灯浴室”受浴。
