Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 24th: Xu Baoyi, director of the surgery department of the Shanghai Second Labor Hospital, and others, based on the distribution pattern of the tubular system within the liver, successfully performed a radical liver resection surgery.

This surgery involved removing the entire right half of the liver (approximately 60% of the liver) from a 43-year-old patient suffering from a giant cavernous hemangioma of the liver. Because the doctors followed the patterns they had explored, the liver resection resulted in almost no bleeding. Originally, the liver was densely packed with blood vessels and had a particularly rich blood supply, making resection surgery prone to massive bleeding and other complications, leading to failures. Therefore, the liver was once considered a "forbidden zone" of surgery.

Dr. Xu Baoyi and Dr. Qiao Long, a surgeon at the Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital, along with Dr. Zhai Jian'an of the Forensic Institute, conducted more than two years of research and experiments on the relationship between the tubular system within the liver and resection surgery.

Today marks exactly eight weeks since the surgery was performed. According to the doctors' examination, the patient's resected liver has already regenerated and returned to its original volume. He will likely be discharged from the hospital after about another week of recuperation.

### 徐宝彝等人切除肝脏手术成功

    徐宝彝等人切除肝脏手术成功
    据新华社上海24日电　上海市立第二劳工医院外科主任徐宝彝等人根据肝脏内管状系统分布的规律，成功地施行了一次广泛性肝脏切除手术。
    这次手术为一个四十三岁患肝脏巨大海绵状血管瘤的病人切去了整个右半肝（约占肝脏的60％）。由于医师们按照他们摸索到的规律进行，切除肝脏竟几乎没有出血。原来肝脏内血管密布，血液特别丰富，施行切除手术时，容易引起大出血等病而失败，因此肝脏曾被认为外科手术的“禁区”。
    徐宝彝医师和上海市立第六人民医院外科医师乔龙、法医研究所医师翟健安等人对于肝脏内管状系统同切除手术的关系，进行了两年多研究和实验。
    到今天，施行这次手术刚正八个星期。据医师检查，病人被切除的肝脏已经再生，恢复到了原来的体积，大约再休养一个星期就能出院。
