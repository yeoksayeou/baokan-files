    Rural Medical and Prevention Network Begins to Take Shape

    The country has more than 2,000 county-level health clinics and hospitals, more than 50,000 clinics distributed in rural market towns, and about 10,000 health stations run by agricultural cooperatives, which play a significant role in ensuring farmers' health and promoting agricultural production.
    
    (Our newspaper reports) Over the past eight years, under the Party and government's kind care and leadership, rural medical and preventive healthcare has rapidly developed, and the rural health landscape has greatly improved.

    Before liberation, there were only over 11,000 beds in county-level hospitals across the country; one-third of the counties had no public health institutions; below the district and township level, apart from 341 district health centers, there were no other public health facilities. However, since the beginning of the First Five-Year Plan, by the end of 1956, the number of beds in various types of hospitals at the county level had reached over 100,000, of which the number of beds in county health clinics and county hospitals reached over 62,000, an increase of 4.6 times compared to the highest number before liberation; the number of health centers in various districts reached over 13,000, and most of the districts that needed to establish them had basically all done so. In counties where diseases were severely prevalent, various specialized prevention and treatment institutions were established with priority. In recent years, many regions have established a system of tiered guidance from provincial to special district (city) to county-level hospitals, and adopted various methods to actively improve the professional and technical level of medical personnel in lower-level hospitals. Many county hospitals and health clinics have mastered the prevention and treatment methods for various epidemic diseases, and some can correctly diagnose and treat general difficult and complicated diseases and perform general abdominal surgeries.

    At present, the more than 2,000 county health clinics and county hospitals across the country, in addition to undertaking the heavy treatment tasks of more than 70 million outpatient visits and more than one million inpatients each year, also actively support various central tasks such as flood prevention, disaster relief, and physical examinations, vigorously conduct guidance on various health services within the county, train a large number of midwives and health workers, and use various methods to organize and carry out health propaganda work, guiding the masses to carry out patriotic health campaigns.

    Medical and health forces in rural areas have been appropriately arranged along with the development of agricultural cooperativization. By the end of 1956, there were more than 50,000 joint clinics and township health centers distributed in market towns and rural areas, and about 10,000 health stations run by agricultural production cooperatives. Other individual practicing doctors and semi-agricultural-semi-medical personnel have also been appropriately arranged under the principle of overall consideration. This strong grassroots health team has formed a rural medical and prevention network, which has played a significant role in extensively and deeply carrying out rural health work, ensuring farmers' health, and completing agricultural production tasks. In recent years, relying on the strength of rural medical personnel, millions of non-full-time health activists (health workers, midwives, etc.) have been trained. Some areas have focused on developing grassroots organizations of the Red Cross Society, organizing the large number of activists who emerged during the movement, and training and improving them. Through the health activists trained, grassroots medical institutions maintain close contact with the masses, forming the core force for carrying out mass health work in rural areas, greatly reducing the incidence of various endemic and infectious diseases.

    乡村医疗预防网开始形成
　　全国设有二千多个县卫生院和医院，分布在农村集镇的诊所达五万个以上，农业社举办的保健站约有一万个，这对保证农民健康和促进农业生产有重大作用
    本报讯　八年来，在党和政府亲切的关怀和领导下，乡村医疗预防事业有了迅速的发展，农村的卫生面貌已经有了很大的改善。
    解放前，全国设在县城的床位有一万一千余张；还有三分之一的县没有设立公立卫生机构；区乡以下，除有三百四十一个区卫生所外，毫无其他公立卫生设施。但是，从第一个五年计划开始以来，到1956年底，设在县内的各类医院的床位数已达十万余张，其中县卫生院、县医院的床位数达六万二千余张，比解放前的最高数还增加了四点六倍；各地区卫生所达一万三千余所，一般需要建立的地区已经基本上全部有了。在疾病流行严重的县内，更重点地设立了各种专业的防治机构。几年来，许多地区已经建立了由省到专区（市）、到县的各级医院逐级指导关系，采取了各种方法积极提高下级医院医务人员的业务技术水平。许多县医院、卫生院已经掌握了各种流行病的防治方法，有些还能正确地诊断和处理一般疑难病症，进行一般的腹部手术。
    目前，全国二千多个县卫生院、县医院除了每年担负了七千多万门诊人次和一百多万住院病人的繁重治疗任务以外，还积极地支援防汛、救灾、体格检查等各项中心工作，大力进行县内各项卫生业务的指导，大批地训练了接生员、卫生员，用各种方法组织和进行卫生宣传工作，指导群众开展爱国卫生运动。
    农村中的医疗卫生力量已经随着农业合作化的发展作了适当的安排。到1956年底，分布在集镇、农村的联合诊所、乡卫生所已有五万所以上，由农业生产合作社举办的保健站约有一万个，其他个体开业医生和半农半医，也在统筹兼顾的原则下作了适当安排。这支强大的基层卫生队伍已经构成了乡村医疗预防网，对广泛深入地开展农村卫生工作，保证农民健康和农业生产任务的完成，起了重大的作用。几年来，依靠农村医务人员的力量，已经培养了数百万不脱产的卫生积极分子（卫生员、接生员等），有些地区已经重点地发展了红十字会基层组织，把运动中涌现的大批积极分子组织起来，加以培养提高。基层医疗机构通过培养的卫生积极分子，与群众密切联系，形成农村中开展群众卫生工作的核心力量，使各种地方病、传染病的发病率大大降低。
