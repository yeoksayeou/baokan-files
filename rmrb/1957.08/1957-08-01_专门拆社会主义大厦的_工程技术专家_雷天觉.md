The First Ministry of Machine Building has held a series of meetings in recent days to expose and refute the anti-communist and anti-socialist remarks of Lei Tianjue, a rightist and deputy director of the Mechanical Science Research Institute, as well as an engineering technical expert.

Lei Tianjue described the Communist Party's leadership of the country as "the Party above the state," saying that "this issue is the general contradiction of all contradictions."

He said: "The Communist Party accounts for only one-sixtieth of the national population, but the number of people who hold positions in state power organs and production leadership is not one-sixtieth, but a fraction; all senior organs are composed of party members." He wanted to drive Communist Party members from leadership positions, saying, "These cadres can be demoted without reducing their salaries. Old cadres who have been injured or have made great contributions can be given a sum of money and should not be taken care of with positions."

He believes it is now time for intellectuals to educate party members.

Lei Tianjue said: "Today's ideological work can no longer educate people with outdated Marxist-Leninist clichés. Today's ideological education work is that intellectuals educate party members first, not party members educating intellectuals first."

Lei Tianjue firmly opposes the ideological transformation of intellectuals. He smeared the Party's ideological education work as "cultivating conditioned reflexes" and vilified socialism as "feudal socialism."

He attacks the unified allocation of cadres as even worse than "Prefect Qiao randomly matching couples."

Lei Tianjue focused his fire on the unified allocation system for cadres, advocating opening up a "free market" for cadres. He said that the current allocation system is even worse than "Prefect Qiao randomly matching couples," and also said: "Once a person arrives at the personnel department, they become a name and number, turning into a dead thing."

He said: "The society I demand is one where socialist ownership coexists with the personal freedom of the bourgeoisie."

He believes that capitalism is better than socialism and expects the "Communist Party to turn to the right."

Lei Tianjue often trumpeted that capitalism is "superior" to socialism. He said: "In the capitalist economy, supply and sales are automatically regulated by the law of value; in the socialist economy, it is manual adjustment. Automatic is better than manual, and manual will break down as soon as there is a problem. He also said, "Socialist life is like taking a shower, either too hot or too cold, and very lacking in automatic adjustment." Therefore, he himself said that he was looking forward to the "Communist Party turning to the right"!

He believes that since the state began planned construction in 1952, the technical level of technical personnel has begun to "shrink" and "regress."

He openly advocates restoring the prostitution system.

He believes that people are all selfish. He even smeared our leader, saying: "Everyone has it, Chairman Mao can't avoid it," "Chairman Mao has been making revolution for thirty years, for the sake of being hailed with 'Long Live' by the masses in Tiananmen Square today." He has many fond memories of the old society and even openly advocates restoring the prostitution system, saying: "Now rape cases are 'more' common, because there are no prostitutes."

Lei Tianjue not only has reactionary remarks but also reactionary activities. In April of this year, as a representative of the National People's Congress, he inspected the Northeast, collecting shortcomings everywhere. In Harbin and Qiqihar, he convened nine forums for factory technicians, asking the factories to send the most opinionated "grumblers" to facilitate his collection of distorted and dissatisfied opinions. After returning from the inspection in May, it was the time of the blooming and contending, and he actively participated in various forums held by Wenhui Daily, Guangming Daily, and others. At the translation personnel forum, he incited the translators to find their own way out, not to wait like "little devils" for the "judge" to solve their fate. During his inspection in the Northeast, he even struck up a relationship with the rightist Pu Xixiu. Pu greatly appreciated his "unique insights," and after returning to Beijing, he actively helped Pu open lists, convene forums for technical personnel, and collect anti-Party opinions.

    专门拆社会主义大厦的“工程技术专家”——雷天觉
    第一机械工业部最近几天来接连举行会议，揭露和驳斥右派分子机械科学研究院的副院长、工程技术专家雷天觉的反共、反社会主义言行。
    雷天觉把共产党对国家的领导说成是“党在国家之上”，说“这个问题是一切矛盾的总矛盾”。
    他说：“共产党只占全国人数六十分之一，担任国家政权机构及生产领导人员的却不是六十分之一，而是几分之一；高级机关则全部是党员。”他想把共产党员从领导岗位上赶下来，说什么“对这些干部可以降级不降薪，老干部负过伤的，有老大功劳的，可以给他一笔钱，不要用岗位照顾他。”
    他认为今天是知识分子教育党员的时候了
    雷天觉说：“今天的思想工作再不能以过时的马列主义陈辞滥调来教育人了。今天的思想教育工作，是知识分子先教育党员，而不是党员先教育知识分子。”
    雷天觉坚决反对知识分子的思想改造。他污蔑党的思想教育工作是“培养条件反射”，诬蔑社会主义是“封建社会主义”。
    他攻击干部的统一调配还不如“乔太守乱点鸳鸯谱”
    雷天觉集中火力攻击干部的统一调配制度，主张开辟干部的“自由市场”。他说现在的调配制度还不如“乔太守乱点鸳鸯谱”，还说：“人一到人事部门，就成为名字和号码，变成死的东西。”
    他说：“我所要求的社会，是社会主义所有制同时保存资产阶级的个人自由”。
    他认为资本主义比社会主义好，期待着“共产党向右转”
    雷天觉经常鼓吹资本主义比社会主义“优越”他说：“资本主义经济，供销有价值法则自动调节，社会主义经济是手动调节。自动比手动好，手动一有毛病就坏了。他还说“社会主义生活好比洗淋浴，不是太热就是太冷，非常缺乏自动调节。”因此他自己说，他期待着“共产党向右转”！
    他认为国家从1952年开始进行计划建设以后，技术人员的技术水平开始“萎缩”了，“倒退”了。
    他公然主张恢复娼妓制度
    他认为人都是自私的。甚至污蔑我们的领袖说：“人人都有，毛主席也免不了”，“毛主席革命三十年，为的是今天在天安门上被群众喊万岁”。他对旧社会有着不少怀念，甚至公然主张恢复娼妓制度。说：“现在强奸案子‘多’了，就是因为妓女没有了。”
    雷天觉不仅有反动的言论还有反动的活动。今年4月他以全国人民代表的身份到东北视察，到处收集缺点，在哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔召集了九次工厂技术人员座谈会，要求厂里派最有意见的“牢骚鬼”参加，以便于他搜集歪曲事实的不满意见。5月视察回来，正是鸣放时期，他参加文汇报、光明日报等召开的各种座谈会，非常活跃。在翻译人员座谈会上煽动翻译人员自找出路，不要像“小鬼”一样等着“判官”解决自己的命运。在东北视察期间，更和右派分子浦熙修拉上关系，浦非常欣赏他的“独特见解”，回京后他就积极帮助浦开名单，召集技术人员座谈会，搜集反党意见。（附图片）
