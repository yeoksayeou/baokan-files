Xinhua News Agency Report: In the past, the leaders of the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Commerce rarely solicited the opinions of general cadres when arranging work, and some important decisions of the departmental affairs meetings were not promptly conveyed to the cadres. Recently, the leadership adopted the opinions of the masses. When arranging the commercial work for the third quarter, they first mobilized cadres from various sections to put forward opinions. Then, they collected the opinions and repeatedly discussed them at the departmental affairs meeting to make decisions, which were then conveyed to the cadres of various sections. This approach has made the general cadres very satisfied. In the past, the Party and League members of the Northwest Textile Bureau did not have much contact with non-Party intellectuals, and some non-Party members were also very restrained when they met Party members, unable to speak freely. During the rectification campaign, Party members and non-Party members made intimate friends.

    同党外人士交知心朋友
    据新华社讯　陕西省商业厅领导上过去布置工作很少征求一般干部的意见，厅务会议的一些重要决定也没有及时向干部传达。最近领导上采纳群众的意见，在安排第三季度商业工作时，预先发动各科室干部提意见，然后把意见集中起来，由厅务会议反复讨论作出决定，再向各科室干部进行传达。这样做使一般干部都很满意。西北纺织管理局的党、团员过去和党外知识分子不大接近，一些党外人士见了党员也很拘束，不能畅所欲言。在整风中，党员和党外人士交了知心朋友。
