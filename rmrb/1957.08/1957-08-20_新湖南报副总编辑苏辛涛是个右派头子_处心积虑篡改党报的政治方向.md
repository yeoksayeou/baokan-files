(Our newspaper, Changsha, 19th) Staff members of the New Hunan Daily recently held eleven symposiums to expose the anti-Party right-wing clique headed by Deputy Editor-in-Chief Su Xintao. Key members of the clique included Deputy Secretary-General Fu Bailu and Editorial Board Member Cai Kecheng. Faced with irrefutable evidence, Su Xintao, Fu Bailu, and Cai Kecheng have begun to confess their counter-revolutionary activities against the Party and socialism. Other members who participated in this clique have also begun to confess, and the struggle is deepening.

This clique has long stubbornly stood on the bourgeois position, attempting to turn the New Hunan Daily into a bourgeois coterie newspaper. Su Xintao emphasized that everything should "start from the characteristics of the newspaper," placing the Party's guidelines and policies in a subordinate position. Fu Bailu and Cai Kecheng, under the guise of the newspaper being a "propaganda organ" and "reflecting the voice of the masses," demanded the large-scale exposure of the dark side of the new society. This right-wing clique consistently held an aversion to publishing the Party committee's instructions in the newspaper, believing that the people did not need to see the Party's policies and propositions in the newspaper. Su Xintao attacked the Party newspaper as a "bulletin board," Cai Kecheng advocated that the staff of the Party newspaper should not read the materials and documents sent by the Party committees at all levels, advocated purging the correspondents working in the Party committee organs, advocated getting rid of the "conclusions" of the Party committee, and carrying out "free debate" in the newspaper.

Because the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China paid great attention to the leadership of the New Hunan Daily, and the editor-in-chief Guan Jianping and secretary-general Meng Shude constantly struggled with this right-wing clique within the newspaper, they could not realize their reactionary propositions. So they carried out sectarian activities, attempting to drive away editor-in-chief Guan Jianping and secretary-general Meng Shude, and created various fallacies to oppose the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee. As early as March of last year, editor-in-chief Guan Jianping, following the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, reported more comprehensively on the experience of agricultural cooperatives in management, but rightists such as Su Xintao were dissatisfied with this practice, and planned to provoke a debate on the propaganda of rural experience and technology at the editorial board meeting. At that time, under the control of Su Xintao, the majority of the editorial board agreed with the views of the rightists. Later, after criticism from the Provincial Party Committee, their conspiracy was not successful. In May of last year, this right-wing clique, under the pretext of improving the work of the newspaper, held two exhibitions in the Readers' Letters Department and the Rural Department, trying to prove that the articles submitted by the Provincial Party Committee and the Department of Agriculture were "inferior drafts" and "dismal." In July of last year, the editorial board held another debate on the policy of running the newspaper. Later, the Provincial Party Committee also discussed this issue and came to the conclusion that the views of Su Xintao and others were wrong, but Su Xintao and others were not convinced and claimed that they would file a complaint to the Central Committee. In November of last year, they came up with a set of plans to "improve" the newspaper, but due to the intervention of the Provincial Party Committee, this plan was not implemented, but it had a very wide range of influence in the editorial department.

During the rectification campaign this spring, this right-wing clique became even more rampant, attempting to create chaos through their reporting, going to the grassroots to stir up trouble, and demanding that the editorial staff learn from Wenhui Daily. On the other hand, they also stirred up trouble within the editorial department, trying to turn the rectification movement into a mass movement against the Provincial Party Committee and to attack Guan Jianping and Meng Shude. Su Xintao and others incited the masses, saying: "The three majorisms in the newspaper are particularly serious, and small democracy alone cannot solve the problem." "It is impossible for the newspaper to strike or go to the streets; it is possible to write letters and petitions." They believed that there were contradictions between the Provincial Party Committee and the people. At that time, some of the lackeys of this right-wing clique were so rampant that they proposed to dissolve the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and remove Zhou Xiaozhou, the first secretary.

After the start of the anti-rightist struggle, the activities of this right-wing clique did not stop. On the one hand, they spread within the newspaper that "there are no rightists among the Party members in the newspaper," and on the other hand, they won over a group of middle-level backbone cadres to speak for them, and arranged for people to go to the Provincial Party Committee to reflect the situation that was favorable to them, trying to deceive the Provincial Party Committee. When the leaders of the Provincial Party Committee and the newspaper repeatedly gave these rightists advice, asking them to honestly and thoroughly confess, they always refused. It was not until the entire staff presented a large number of facts and angrily accused them of their crimes that they began to confess.

    新湖南报副总编辑苏辛涛是个右派头子
    处心积虑篡改党报的政治方向
    本报长沙19日电　新湖南报工作人员最近举行了十一次座谈会，揭发以副总编辑苏辛涛为首的党内右派小集团。小集团重要成员有副秘书长傅白芦、编辑委员蔡克诚。在铁的事实面前，苏辛涛、傅白芦、蔡克诚已开始交代他们反党反社会主义的罪恶活动。曾经参与这个小集团的其他成员也开始交代，斗争正在深入开展中。
    这个小集团长期顽固地站在资产阶级立场，企图把新湖南报办成资产阶级的同人报。苏辛涛强调一切要“从报纸的特点出发”，而把党的方针、政策摆在从属的地位。傅白芦和蔡克诚打着报纸是“舆论机关”、“反映群众呼声”的招牌，要求大肆揭露新社会的阴暗面。这个右派小集团对于报纸上刊登党委指示一贯抱着厌恶的态度，认为人民群众不需要从报纸上看到党的政策和主张。苏辛涛攻击党报是“布告牌”，蔡克诚主张党报的工作人员不要看各级党委机关寄来的材料和文件，主张洗刷在党委机关工作的通讯员，主张摆脱党委的“定论”，而在报纸上开展“自由争论”。
    由于中共湖南省委很注意对新湖南报的领导，报社内部又有总编辑官健平、秘书长孟树德不断同这个右派小集团进行斗争，无法实现他们的反动主张。于是他们就进行宗派活动，企图赶走总编辑官健平和秘书长孟树德，并制造各种谬论，反对省委领导。早在去年3月，总编辑官健平执行省委指示，比较集中地报道了农业社经营管理的经验，可是苏辛涛等右派分子不满这种做法，有计划地在编委会上挑起一场关于农村经验技术宣传的争论。当时在苏辛涛的把持下，多数编委同意了右派分子的看法。后来经过省委的批评，他们的阴谋才未得逞。去年5月，这个右派小集团借口改进报纸工作，在读者来信部和农村部搞了两个展览会，想证明省委和农业厅交来发表的文章是“劣稿”“灰溜溜的一片”。去年7月，编委会又进行了一场关于办报方针的争论。后来省委也讨论了这个问题，做出结论，指出苏辛涛等人的观点是错误的，但苏辛涛等人不服气，声称要到中央告状。去年11月，他们又搞出一套“改进”报纸的方案，由于省委的干预，这个方案没有实行，但在编辑部中流毒很广。
    今春鸣放期间，这个右派小集团更猖狂起来，一方面在报道上企图乱鸣乱放，到基层点火；并要编辑部同志向文汇报学习。另一方面，又在编辑部内点火，想把整风运动变成一个群众性的反对省委，打击官健平和孟树德的运动。苏辛涛等煽动群众说：“报社三大主义特别严重，单是小民主不能解决。”“报社罢工、上街不可能；上书、请愿是可能的。”他们认为省委和人民之间有矛盾，当时这个右派小集团的喽啰中竟有人猖狂到提出要解散中共湖南省委会、撤销第一书记周小舟的职务。
    反右派斗争开始后，这个右派小集团的活动并未停止，一面在报社内散布：“报社党员中没有右派分子”，另一方面又拉拢一批中层骨干干部，为他们讲话，并布置人到省委去反映对他们有利的情况，企图蒙蔽省委。当省委和报社领导同志一再对这些右派分子进行忠告，要他们老老实实彻底交代时，他们一直拒绝。直到全体工作人员举出大量事实，愤怒指责他们的罪行时，他们才开始交代。
