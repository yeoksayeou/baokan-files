    The talks between the delegation of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the government and the delegation of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the government of the German Democratic Republic concluded on August 13. The significant achievements of the talks are reflected in the joint statement issued by the Soviet and German party and government delegations. It is clear from this statement that the two sides are in complete agreement on the issues discussed, whether they be the European situation, disarmament, and the issue of German reunification, or the strengthening of mutual assistance and cooperation between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic, as well as the assessment of the current international communist movement.

    It is of great significance that the Soviet state leaders visited the German Democratic Republic at this time and held talks with the leaders of the German Democratic Republic. One can understand this by paying a little attention to the current situation in Germany. Since the signing of the aggressive Paris Agreements by the imperialist bloc, the development of the situation in West Germany has increasingly caused anxiety among peace-loving people in Europe and around the world. With the support of the imperialist forces headed by the United States, West Germany has never relaxed its pace on the road to militarization over the years. With the progress of rearmament and economic expansion, the West German militarists have grown in strength, and their aggressive nature is becoming increasingly apparent. What is even more serious is that the United States is deploying atomic weapons in West Germany and helping West Germany prepare for the development of nuclear weapons production. Facts have proven that the imperialist bloc has long abandoned its obligations to peacefully resolve the German question. They have not only repeatedly and categorically rejected the proposals for German reunification put forward by the Soviet Union or the German Democratic Republic, but are also determined to transform West Germany into the core armed force of the North Atlantic bloc and the main base for launching new wars. In fact, a new anti-Soviet, anti-communist, and anti-people aggressive axis is taking shape in Europe today, and that is the United States-West Germany axis. The actions of the imperialist bloc headed by the United States in West Germany are tantamount to adding dangerous fuel to the most explosive land in the center of Europe, thus seriously threatening the survival of the German nation and the peace and security of the people of all European countries. Due to this development of the situation in West Germany, even more serious obstacles have been brought to the already very complex issue of German reunification.

    In view of this situation, what attitude should the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic, which have close relations with the German issue and the European situation, take? This is exactly what the Soviet-German talks needed to clarify and have clarified. The joint Soviet-German statement emphasized the potentially devastating consequences for West Germany caused by the deployment of atomic weapons there, and expressed its willingness to reach an agreement with West Germany and Western countries on the issue of neither deploying nor producing atomic weapons on German territory. This shows the imperialist bloc that the deployment of atomic weapons in West Germany and Western European countries has not put the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic and other socialist countries in a weak position. On the contrary, this will only bring them possibly unimaginable consequences. Because everyone knows that today atomic weapons are not only in the hands of Western countries. But for the sake of the interests of the German people and the peace and security of Europe, the Soviet and German statements still expressed the desire to prevent Germany from becoming an atomic battlefield.

    During the talks, the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic discussed in detail the issue of restoring German reunification and believed that this was primarily a matter for the German people themselves. This emphasis is very necessary. The reason why the issue of German reunification has not made significant progress over the years is primarily because the imperialist bloc and the West German authorities have consistently refused to recognize the fact that two German states exist simultaneously. Although these two German states are following different paths of development in terms of internal and foreign affairs, their rights should be equally respected when resolving the issue of unified Germany. Everyone knows that the Adenauer group can only represent the interests of West German monopoly capital, large landowners, and American imperialism. They are simply not qualified to claim to represent the interests of the entire German nation. Therefore, the West's fantasy of restoring German reunification at the expense of the interests of the German Democratic Republic, or even achieving the goal of reunification through annexation from a position of strength, has nothing in common with the proposition of a truly unified Germany. Only on the basis of recognizing the reality of Germany today can both sides find points of contact to further negotiate the path and methods for resolving the issue of German reunification. In this regard, the recent proposal by Prime Minister Grotewohl on the establishment of a German federation is of practical significance. The Soviet-German talks statement reaffirmed this proposal and affirmed that only the path of rapprochement and negotiation between the two existing Germanies is the path to peacefully resolve the German issue. If West Germany accepts this proposal and reaches an agreement with the German Democratic Republic on prohibiting the installation and manufacture of atomic weapons on German territory, on the withdrawal of the two Germanies from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact Organization, and on the withdrawal of foreign troops from Germany, then the issue of German reunification can be said to be half resolved, and European peace will be reliably guaranteed. However, West Germany's response to the Soviet-German talks reflected the opposite. As for the Western countries headed by the United States, they have also made it clear in the recent declaration on the issue of German reunification by the United States, Britain, France, and West Germany that they will continue to obstruct German reunification in order to continue to maintain a hotbed for creating international tension and preparing for new wars in Europe.

    During the talks, the Soviet Union expressed its firm support for the German Democratic Republic, and the two countries reiterated the inviolability of the independence and borders of the German Democratic Republic. This is a solemn warning to those restless imperialist aggressor forces west of the Elbe River. The two countries also decided to take measures to further develop bilateral trade relations and cooperation in industrial production. This once again demonstrates the unshakable unity of socialist countries and the internationalist spirit of mutual support and cooperation. There is no doubt that the important achievements of the Soviet-German talks will help strengthen the power of the socialist camp and consolidate peace in Europe and the world.

### 苏德会谈的重大成果

    苏德会谈的重大成果
    苏联共产党和政府代表团同德国统一社会党和德意志民主共和国政府代表团的会谈，已在8月13日结束。会谈所取得的重大成果，反映在苏德党政代表团所发表的联合声明中。人们从这个声明中可以清楚地看出，会谈所接触到的问题，无论是欧洲局势、裁减军备和德国统一问题，也无论是加强苏联同民主德国的互助合作问题以及对目前国际共产主义运动的估计问题，双方的观点和主张都是完全一致的。
    苏联国家领导人在目前这种时机访问德意志民主共和国，并同民主德国的领导人进行会谈，是具有重要意义的。只要稍稍注意一下当前德国的局势，人们就可以理解这一点。自从帝国主义集团侵略性的巴黎协定签订以来，西德局势的发展越来越引起欧洲和世界各国爱好和平的人民的焦虑不安。在以美国为首的帝国主义势力的支持下，这些年来西德在军国主义化的道路上始终没有放松过自己的步伐。而随着重新武装和经济扩张的进展，西德军国主义者的羽毛渐丰，它的侵略性质也正在日益昭彰地显露出来。更其严重的是，美国以在西德配置原子武器，并帮助西德准备发展核武器的生产。事实证明，帝国主义集团早已把它们所负有的和平解决德国问题的义务丢在一边。它们不但一再地断然拒绝苏联或德意志民主共和国提出的统一德国问题的主张，而且一心要把西德变成为北大西洋集团武装的核心力量和发动新战争的主要基地。事实上，今天欧洲正在形成着一个新的反苏、反共、反人民的侵略轴心，这就是美国、西德轴心。以美国为首的帝国主义集团在西德的这种做法，无异是在欧洲中心最具有爆炸性的这块土地上加添危险的燃料，因而严重地威胁到德国民族的生存和欧洲各国人民的和平与安全。由于西德局势的这种发展，给本来已经十分复杂的德国统一问题带来了更加严重的障碍。
    针对着这种情况，对德国问题和欧洲局势有着密切关系的苏联和德意志民主共和国应该采取什么态度？这正是这次苏德会谈所需要表明和已经表明了的。苏德两国的联合声明强调指出了由于西德配置原子武器而可能造成的对于西德的毁灭性后果，并愿意同西德和西方国家就双方都不在德国领土上配置和生产原子武器的问题达成协议。这就向帝国主义集团表明，它们在西德和西欧国家配置原子武器以后，并没有使苏联和德意志民主共和国和其他社会主义国家处于软弱的地位，相反地，这只会给它们本身带来可能不堪设想的后果。因为谁都知道，今天原子武器并不只是掌握在西方国家的手里。但是为了德国人民的利益和欧洲的和平安全，苏德两国声明仍然表示了防止使德国成为原子战场的愿望。
    苏德两国在会谈中详细地讨论了恢复德国统一的问题，并认为这首先是德国人民自己的事情。这样强调是十分必要的。这些年来德国统一问题之所以没有获得重大进展，首先是因为帝国主义集团和西德当局一直拒绝承认有两个德意志国家同时存在的事实。虽然这两个德意志国家在内政和外交方面都走着各不相同的发展道路，但是在解决统一德国问题的时候，它们的权利都应该受到同样的尊重。谁都知道，阿登纳集团只能代表西德垄断资本、大地主和美帝国主义的利益。他们根本没有资格自命为整个德国民族利益的代表。因此，西方那种以牺牲德意志民主共和国的利益来恢复德国的统一，甚至从实力地位出发以兼并的手段来达到统一目的的妄想，同真正的统一德国的主张是毫无共同之处的。只有在承认今天德国现实的基础上，双方才能找到接触点，来进一步协商解决德国统一问题的道路和方法。在这方面，格罗提渥总理最近提出的关于建立德意志联邦的建议，是具有现实意义的。苏德会谈声明重申了这个建议，并且肯定指出，只有现存的两个德国接近和谈判的道路，才是和平解决德国问题的道路。假如西德接受这一建议，并且同德意志民主共和国就禁止在德国领土上设置和制造原子武器，就两个德国分别退出北大西洋集团和华沙条约组织，以及就外国军队撤出德国等问题达成协议的话，那么德国统一的问题就可以说解决了一半，而欧洲的和平也将会得到可靠的保障。但是西德对于这次苏德会谈所反映的恰恰是与此相反。至于以美国为首的西方国家，那么在不久以前的美、英、法和西德四国关于德国统一问题宣言中也已经表明，它们仍将阻挠德国的统一，以便在欧洲继续保持这样一个制造国际紧张局势和准备新战争的温床。
    在会谈中，苏联对德意志民主共和国表示了坚决的支持，两国重申德意志民主共和国独立和边境的不可侵犯性。这是对易北河西岸那些蠢蠢欲动的帝国主义侵略势力的一个严正警告。两国还决定采取一些措施来进一步发展双方的贸易关系和工业生产方面的合作。这就再一次表明了社会主义国家不可动摇的团结和互相支持合作的国际主义精神。毫无疑问，苏德会谈所获得的重要成果，有助于社会主义阵营力量的增强和欧洲与世界和平的巩固。
