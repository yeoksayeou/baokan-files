Mo Ge's Reactionary Remarks Declared Bankrupt

(By our newspaper) According to the Qinghai Daily, all cadres of the Qinghai People's Publishing House held several meetings successively to severely refute the reactionary remarks of rightist Mo Ge.

During the rectification campaign, Mo Ge made malicious slanders against the Party. He said very arrogantly: "The Communist Party has slowly deteriorated in recent years. Bureaucratism, sectarianism, and subjectivism have become increasingly serious and have developed to a dangerous point. Now that intellectuals are making suggestions, workers and peasants are dissatisfied with the Party. They have many opinions, but they dare not raise them. Just wait and see!"

Mo Ge believed that because Communist Party members have special privileges, high salaries, and much honor, a "wall" has formed between the Party and the masses. The "wall" between the Party and the masses was built by Party members, and the Youth League members dug a "ditch" outside. Pseudo-activists erected a "barbed wire fence" around the ditch. He viciously called Party and Youth League members "secret police" and demanded that the Party "reform" its reporting and confidentiality system.

Mo Ge denied the great achievements of the anti-counterrevolutionary campaign, saying that "50% of the national anti-counterrevolutionary work was wrong." Mo Ge attacked our country's personnel system, saying that emphasizing "work needs" to transfer cadres was dogmatism.

After the start of the rectification campaign, Mo Ge stirred up trouble among comrades, instigated others to attack the Party, and attempted to use others as a cat's paw. He tried to win over some people who had grievances against the organization on certain issues, inciting them to "make suggestions" to the Party.

Now, Mo Ge has initially admitted his mistakes, but he has not yet fully explored and confessed the ideological source and all the problems of his reactionary remarks.

    莫戈的反动言论宣告破产
    本报讯　据青海日报消息，青海省人民出版社全体干部，先后数次召开会议，严厉驳斥右派分子莫戈的反动言论。
    在整风期间，莫戈对党作了恶毒的污蔑，他非常嚣张地说：“共产党几年来慢慢地变坏了，官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义愈来愈严重，已经发展到危险的地步。现在知识分子提意见了，工人、农民都对党不满，他们有很多意见，只是不敢提，以后看吧！”
    莫戈认为，由于共产党员有特殊享受，薪金高，荣誉多，因此在党同群众中间形成了一堵“墙”。党同群众之间的“墙”是党员砌的，团员在外面挖了一条“沟”，假积极分子又绕沟架了一道“铁丝网”。他恶毒地称党团员为“秘密警察”，并要党“改革”汇报和保密制度。
    莫戈否认肃反工作的伟大成就，说“全国肃反工作50％是错了”。莫戈攻击我们国家的人事制度，说强调“工作需要”调动干部，这是教条主义。
    在整风开始以后，莫戈在同志中无事生非，唆使别人向党进攻，企图借刀杀人。他企图拉拢一些在某些问题上对组织有不满情绪的人，煽动他们对党“提意见”。
    现在，莫戈已初步承认了错误，但是他还没有把反动言论的思想根源和全部问题挖掘和交代出来。
