In his speech at the reception, Marshal Peng Dehuai said that the Chinese People's Liberation Army has realized the wishes of the Chinese people and opened up the path of socialism for the Chinese people. This army was, is, and always will be the army of the Chinese people.

Xinhua News Agency, 1st Dispatch. General Su Yu, Chief of General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, hosted a banquet tonight to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, in honor of military attaches from various countries stationed in China.

General Su Yu spoke at the banquet. He said that the reason why the Chinese People's Liberation Army was able to achieve victory was due to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the support of the broad masses of the people, and the high political consciousness of all commanders and fighters. At the same time, it was also because our struggle was just. Therefore, it also won the sympathy and moral support of progressive people all over the world. When he talked about the achievements of the modernization construction of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, he said that we must thank the people of our great ally—the Soviet Union—and other fraternal countries for their brotherly assistance to us.

General Su Yu pointed out in his speech that due to the continuous growth of peace forces, the current international situation is developing in a direction conducive to striving for lasting world peace. However, the imperialist aggressive bloc continues to pursue a policy of arms expansion and war preparation. In the Far East, American imperialism continues to occupy our territory of Taiwan, and has established missile bases on our territory of Taiwan. Recently, it has barbarously undermined the Korean Armistice Agreement and transported new weapons into South Korea. Therefore, the threat of war still exists. We must be vigilant at all times.

General Su Yu emphasized that we love peace and oppose war, because war will bring new disasters to mankind. We will never invade others, but we will never allow others to invade us. We adhere to the well-known Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in international relations, and advocate peaceful coexistence among countries with different social systems. We are willing to work together with all of you present to enhance the friendship between the people and armies of all countries, and to stop war and safeguard peace.

General Su Yu proposed a toast for the striving for lasting world peace, for the ever-increasing friendship between the people and armies of all countries, and for the health of all military attaches and their wives!

After the banquet, the color documentary film "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire" was shown.

    新华社1日讯　国务院副总理兼国防部部长彭德怀元帅今晚在北京举行盛大酒会，庆祝中国人民解放军建军三十周年。
    出席酒会的，有刘少奇、朱德、邓小平、董必武、李济深、沈钧儒、郭沫若、陈叔通、彭真、贺龙元帅、陈毅元帅、聂荣臻元帅、黄克诚大将、徐海东大将、罗瑞卿大将、谭政大将等党和国家的领导人员，各民主党派负责人，科学界、文艺界、新闻界、各人民团体和北京市各界代表，以及陪同出席酒会的中国人民解放军高级将领等共一千多人。
    彭德怀元帅在酒会上致词说，中国人民解放军已经实现了中国人民的愿望，为中国人民开拓了社会主义的道路。这支军队过去是、现在是、将来永远是中国人民的军队。
    酒会上，宾主们频频干杯相互祝贺。
    据新华社1日讯　中国人民解放军总参谋长粟裕大将今晚为庆祝中国人民解放军建军三十周年，设宴招待各国驻中国武官。
    粟裕大将在宴会上讲了话。他说，中国人民解放军之所以能够取得胜利，是由于中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导，是由于广大人民的拥护和支援，是由于全军指战员具有高度的政治觉悟。同时，也是由于我们的斗争是正义的。因而，也获得了全世界进步人民的同情和道义上的支援。他谈到中国人民解放军现代化建设成就时说，我们要感谢我们的伟大盟邦——苏联和其他兄弟国家的人民，对我们进行了兄弟般的帮助。
    粟裕大将在讲话中指出，由于和平力量的不断壮大，目前国际局势正朝着有利于争取世界持久和平的方向发展。但是，帝国主义侵略集团仍继续执行扩军备战政策。在远东，美帝国主义仍继续霸占我国领土台湾，并在我国领土台湾设立导弹基地，最近又横蛮的破坏朝鲜停战协定，将新式武器运入南朝鲜。因此，战争的威胁依然存在。我们在任何时候都必须提高警惕。
    粟裕大将强调说，我们爱好和平，反对战争，因为战争会给人类带来新的灾难。我们绝不侵略别人，但也决不允许别人侵略我们。我们奉行国际关系中著名的五项原则，主张不同社会制度国家的和平共处。我们愿与在座各位为增进各国人民和军队之间的友谊，为制止战争，保卫和平而共同努力。
    粟裕大将提议为争取世界持久和平，为各国人民和军队之间的日益增进的友谊，为各位武官和夫人的健康干杯！
    宴会结束后放映了电影五彩纪录片“星火燎原”。
