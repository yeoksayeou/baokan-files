    Zhaohuli Township's Past and Present
    Song Jie
    The materials described here are just the general situation of an ordinary village – Zhaohuli Township in Huimin County, Shandong Province. But from this investigative material, people can see how the face of rural Shandong is changing after land reform and agricultural collectivization. It also proves how absurd the recent remarks of those right-wing elements, such as "farmers bear a heavy burden, farmers live a life of hunger," are!
    Comparison of Three Years
    Zhaohuli Township is located close to the north bank of the Yellow River and is a grain-producing township mainly producing wheat, soybeans, and other miscellaneous grains. This township has historically been relatively poor due to the low-lying and waterlogged land. In 1956, the first year after the realization of agricultural collectivization, the township suffered severe flooding, and more than 2,300 mu of land, accounting for more than 10% of the township, suffered crop failure. However, compared to 1949, before the township was organized, and 1936, the year with the highest output before liberation, the actual income of farmers has significantly increased. Let's look at the following figures (Note: All monetary amounts in the text are calculated based on the then-current prices of goods and then converted to RMB, the same below):

Year | Total Income (RMB) | Agricultural Tax (RMB) | Production Investment (RMB) | Farmers' Actual Income (RMB)
------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------
1936 | 376,400 | 67,750 | 9,000 | 206,700
1949 | 421,000 | 53,700 | 20,000 | 294,000
1956 | 482,400 | 53,700 | 91,700 | 431,600

    What can the above figures illustrate? First of all, it tells people that under the leadership of the Communist Party, agricultural production in Zhaohuli Township is gradually developing, and farmers' incomes are also increasing year by year. In 1936, the year of bumper harvest before liberation, Zhaohuli Township, which owned more than 20,000 mu of land, only produced an average of about 160 jin of grain per mu per year. In 1949, after liberation, through land reform and initial construction work, the total income of this township increased by 11.2%. In the seven years from 1950 to 1956, this township gradually developed from small mutual aid groups into three socialist agricultural cooperatives. In the first year after the realization of agricultural collectivization throughout the township, although it suffered severe waterlogging, the total income of the township exceeded 1936 before liberation by 28.16% due to the great superiority of agricultural cooperatives, which was also an increase of more than 15% compared with 1949 when it was not organized.
    The above figures also prove that after liberation, under the leadership of the People's Government, the proportion of agricultural tax decreased year by year, and the proportion of farmers' actual income increased year by year. In 1936, the farmers of this township paid as much as more than 67,750 yuan in public grain and various taxes to the reactionary government, accounting for more than 18% of the total income. After deducting a small amount of production costs, the income of farmers' hard work for a year only accounted for about 55% of the total income. In 1949 after liberation, although it was still in the period of the Liberation War, the total amount of farmers' taxes decreased by 21%. After deducting production costs, the actual income of farmers accounted for about 70% of the total income. By 1956, the total income of this township had increased by 28.16%, but the total amount of agricultural tax revenue had always remained stable at the level of 1949. Production investment in 1956 increased by 21.7% compared with 1936. Due to the gradual decrease in the proportion of agricultural tax, the actual income of farmers increased by 46.5%.
    It should also be noted here that the total amount of farmers' actual income before liberation included the 91 households of landlords and rich peasants, who accounted for only 10% of the township's population, owned more than 20% of the land, and also engaged in a large number of side businesses and some commerce. These people not only had more income but also exploited it from the hands of farmers. The poor and lower-middle peasants, who accounted for the majority of the township, lived a poor life of being poorly clothed and fed all day long. How has the life of these truly working farmers changed and improved after liberation? Let's analyze further.
    They Began to Live a Prosperous Life
    Here, I will first use some figures to briefly describe the actual income and consumption of people of all classes in this township in three periods (see the attached table for details):

Class | Income/Consumption Item | 1936 (RMB/Person) | 1949 (RMB/Person) | 1956 (RMB/Person)
------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------
Landlord/Rich Peasant | Actual Income | 160 | 110 | 90
Upper-Middle Peasant | Actual Income | 52 | 55 | 60
 | Consumption Expenditure | 30 | 45 | 90
Middle Peasant | Actual Income | 38 | 40 | 50
Poor/Lower-Middle Peasant | Actual Income | 25 | 30 | 51
 | Consumption Expenditure | 20 | 25 | 45

    From the figures in the attached table, we can clearly see that the poor and lower-middle peasants, who account for the majority of farmers in the township, have increased their average actual income per person (including the approximately 25% increase in population in recent years, the same below) by more than 70% through land reform and with the development of agricultural collectivization. Therefore, they not only changed the past life of half a year of bran and vegetable food but also enabled some farmers to have savings. Xing Desheng, an elderly farmer in his sixties in Zhaohuli Village of this township, said: Before liberation, in their village of more than 260 households, there were more than 70 poor farmers who often went out to work as coolies, and no less than a dozen households who begged for food all year round. Even those lower-middle peasants who had a little land only had an average income of about 30 yuan per person, and they were always in danger of being ruined by disasters and diseases. How could they often eat fine rice and white flour like they do now! The actual income of upper-middle peasants, who account for about 30% of farmers, has only increased by about 15%. However, their living standards have also improved rapidly. According to the survey of six middle-peasant members in Zhaohuli Village, the average actual income per person in 1936 was about 52 yuan. At that time, due to the existence of the idea of getting rich, consumption expenditure was only more than 30 yuan. After the agricultural collectivization in 1956, the actual income increased by 15.6%, while consumption expenditure increased by 73%. After liberation, the only people whose income decreased were those few landlords and rich peasants who lived by exploiting the surplus labor of farmers in the past. Before liberation, the annual income of landlords and rich peasants was three to five times higher than that of ordinary farmers, and some even reached more than ten times. In the past few years after liberation, some landlords and rich peasant elements have not developed good labor habits, and their income is slightly lower than that of ordinary farmers. However, their income is about 70% higher than the income of poor and lower-middle peasants before liberation. Therefore, they are not "starving and freezing," but most of them have enough to eat and wear, and they are well-fed and well-clothed.
    During my stay in this township, I personally witnessed many peasant families who had been emancipated flourishing and developing. Before liberation, the family of five of poor peasant Li Zhongquan only had an income of more than 170 yuan. At that time, let alone eating fish and meat, even eating salt and vegetables was very rare. After liberation, his family's income more than doubled. Every year, they can not only eat a quarter of fine grain and white flour, but also the amount of meat and oil they eat has increased from an average of about one and a half jin per person per year to more than eight jin. With the increase in wealth, the purchasing power of this township for industrial products has also increased year by year. According to the statistics of only one item of foreign cloth, the whole township only purchased 213.61 bolts in the 1949 year (from the beginning of September of the same year to the end of August of the following year, the same below), which increased to 969.76 bolts in the 1955 year. From the beginning of September last year to the end of June this year, 989.76 bolts have been purchased in ten months.
    Farmers Also Speak
    Recently, those right-wing elements representing the landlord class clamored that "farmers' lives have not improved, and they do not need the leadership of the Communist Party," and other anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks have aroused the anger of the broad masses of farmers in Zhaohuli Township. In recent days, the farmers of this township have been constantly gathering to expose the reactionary conspiracy of the right-wing elements. Many farmers said angrily: Those bourgeois right-wing elements with ulterior motives are using some words that seem to "bestow" us to undermine the leadership of the Communist Party and undermine the worker-peasant alliance. They want us to go back to the old road of being exploited. We have seen through the conspiracy of this small group of right-wing elements. Xing Desheng, an elderly farmer who had been fleeing famine for many years, said: We firmly stand with the worker brothers and take the socialist road under the leadership of the Communist Party.

    皂户李乡的过去和现在
    宋杰
    这里记述的材料，只不过是一个普通乡村——山东省惠民县皂户李乡的一般情况，但从这个调查材料里，人们却可以看到经过土地改革和农业合作化以后，山东农村的面貌是怎样在改变着；同时也证明了最近那些右派分子的所谓“农民负担重，农民过着饥饿的生活”等言论，是何等的荒谬！
    三个年头的对比
    皂户李乡紧靠黄河北岸，是一个以产小麦、大豆和其他杂粮为主的产粮乡。这个乡由于土地涝洼，历来都是较贫困的。这个乡在实现农业合作化以后的第一年——1956年，又遭受了严重的涝灾，占全乡百分之十几的二千三百多亩土地失收，但比该乡没有组织起来以前的1949年，和解放前产量最高的1936年，农民的实际收入确有显著的提高。让我们看看下列数字（注：文内钱数均依当时的实物价格计算，然后折为人民币，下同）：
    上面的数字能说明什么问题呢？它首先告诉人们，在共产党的领导下，皂户李乡的农业生产正在逐步发展，农民的收入也逐年增加了。在解放前的丰收年——1936年，拥有两万多亩土地的皂户李乡，平均每亩土地年产粮食仅一百六十斤左右。1949年解放后，经过土地改革和初步的建设工作，这个乡的总收入就提高11.2％。1950年到1956年的七年中，这个乡由小型的互助组逐渐发展成三个社会主义性质的农业合作社，在全乡实现农业合作化以后的第一年，虽然遭受到严重的内涝灾害，但由于农业合作社的巨大优越性，全乡总收入超过解放前的1936年28.16％，比没有组织起来的1949年也增加15％以上。
    上面的数字也证明了：解放后，在人民政府的领导下，农业税的比例逐年减少，农民实际收入的比例逐年增加。1936年，这个乡的农民仅向反动政府缴纳的公粮和各种赋税就达六万七千七百五十多元，占总收入的18％以上，再除掉小量的生产费用，农民辛苦一年的所得，仅占总收入的55％左右。解放后的1949年，虽然还处在解放战争时期，但农民的赋税总数减少了21％，再除去生产费用，农民实际收入占总收入的70％左右。到1956年，这个乡的总收入已增加28.16％，但农业税收的总数还始终稳定在1949年的水平。1956年的生产投资比1936年增加21.7％。由于农业税的比例逐年减少，农民的实际收入增加46.5％。
    这里还应该说明一点，解放前农民实际收入的总数，包括人口只占全乡10％、土地占20％以上并兼营大量副业和部分商业的九十一户地主和富农在内。这些人不仅收入多，而且是从农民手里剥削来的，占全乡大多数的贫农和下中农终日过着衣不蔽寒、食不饱肚的贫困生活。这些真正的劳动农民解放后的生活是如何变化提高的呢？让我们再进一步分析。
    他们开始过富裕的生活
    这里也先用一些数字，把这个乡各阶层人口的实际收入和消费情况，分三个时期简述如下（详见附表）：
    从附表的数字里我们可以清楚看出，占全乡农户大多数的贫农和下中农，经过土地改革和随着农业合作化的发展，平均每人（包括几年内增加的25％左右的人口，下同）的实际收入增加70％以上，因此不仅改变了过去糠菜半年粮的生活，并使一部分农户有了节余。这个乡皂户李村六十多岁的老年农民邢德胜说：在解放以前，他们这个二百六十多户的村庄，经常出外做苦工的贫农有七十多人，常年讨饭的不下十多户。就是那些稍有土地的下中农，平均每人的收入也不过三十元左右，随时都有因灾荒、病亡而造成倾家荡产的危险，那能像现在这样经常吃细米白面呢！占农户30％左右的上中农，实际收入虽然仅增加15％左右。但他们的生活水平提高也是很快的。据皂户李村六户中农社员的调查，1936年平均每人实际收入五十二元左右，当时由于存在着发家致富的思想，消费开支仅有三十多元。1956年农业合作化以后，实际收入增加15.6％，而消费开支增加73％。解放后减少收入的只是那些为数很少，过去靠剥削农民的剩余劳动而生活的地主和富农。解放前，地主、富农每年的收入高于一般农户三倍到五倍，有的竟达十倍以上。解放后的几年来，还有一部分地主富农分子没有养成很好的劳动习惯，收入略低于一般农户，但收入比解放前的贫农和下中农的收入高出70％左右，因此他们也不是什么“饥寒交迫”，而大多数是有吃有穿，丰衣足食。
  　我在这个乡的期间，亲眼看到许多翻身后的农民家庭，蓬蓬勃勃的发展起来。贫农李中泉在没有解放以前，全家五口人仅收入一百七十多元，那个时候别说吃鱼吃肉，就连吃盐吃菜也为数很少。解放后他家的收入增加一倍以上，每年不仅能吃到四分之一的细粮白面，吃肉吃油的数量也由过去平均每人每年一斤半左右增加到八斤以上。随着财富的增加，这个乡对工业品的购买力也逐年提高。仅据洋布一项的统计，1949年度（同年9月初到下一年8月底，下同）全乡仅购买了二百一十三点六一匹，1955年度增加到九百六十九点七六匹，去年9月初到今年6月底的十个月内，已购买九百八十九点七六匹。
    农民也说话了
    最近那些代表地主阶级的右派分子叫嚣什么“农民生活没有改善，不要共产党领导”等反党反社会主义的言论，已激起皂户李乡广大农民的愤怒。近日来这个乡的农民不断的集会，揭发右派分子的反动阴谋。许多农民愤怒地说：那些别有用心的资产阶级右派分子用一些表面上好像“恩赐”我们的话来破坏共产党的领导，破坏工农联盟，想让我们回到受剥削的老路上去，我们看透了这一小撮右派分子的阴谋。曾经逃荒在外多年的老年农民邢德胜说：我们坚决同工人兄弟站在一起，在共产党的领导下走社会主义道路。
