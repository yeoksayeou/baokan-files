    Big Fish Eat Little Fish
    According to a recent report in the American magazine "Fortune," the 500 largest companies in the United States control 50% of the country's machinery manufacturing and coal mining production. They seize 65% of the profits from the nation's machinery manufacturing and coal mining industries. In 1955, only twenty-six large companies had sales of over one billion dollars, but in 1956, this number increased to thirty-two. The number of companies with sales of over one hundred million dollars rose from three hundred and seven in 1955 to three hundred and forty-seven in 1956. Due to the high concentration of monopoly capital, small and medium-sized enterprises are constantly being squeezed out. The turnover of machinery manufacturing enterprises with assets of less than five million dollars has never increased since World War II. From 1951 to 1956, the turnover of small businesses nationwide decreased by approximately 4% in dollar terms.

    大鱼吃小鱼
    据美国“幸福”杂志最近的报道，美国的五百家大公司掌握了全国机器制造业和煤矿工业的50％的产品。它们攫取了全国机器制造业和煤矿工业的65％利润。1955年营业额在十亿美元以上的大公司只有二十六个，而1956年增加到三十二个。营业额在一亿美元以上的公司，在1955年有三百零七个，而在1956年上升到三百四十七个。由于垄断资本的高度集中，中小企业不断地受到排挤。资产在五百万美元以下的机器制造企业的营业额自第二次世界大战以来从未上升过。在1951年到1956年，全国小企业的营业额以美元计算下降了约4％。
