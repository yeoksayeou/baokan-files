　　Restricting the Commercial Activities of Commune Members Unrelated to Agriculture
    Currently, many agricultural cooperatives here are suffering from the inability to unify the use of labor. For example, in Hou Lihua Village in Renqiu County, there are more than 3,200 mu of cultivated land. Last year, due to severe disasters, only 89 head of draft animals remained, a loss of 25%. Therefore, only by intensifying operations on the land can we catch up with the production levels of previous years. However, 56 strong people are engaged in commerce outside the village year-round, not participating in agricultural production. Fifteen of them are doing business by bicycle, and the rest are peddling by shoulder pole and cart. In addition, the price of supplied grain is cheap. A merchant in the village named Wang En said, "I don't go to the fields, I don't go to the threshing ground, but I can still carry wheat home with money!" Those who participate in agricultural cooperative labor, however, earn very little each day. Therefore, the peasants' aversion to agriculture is increasing day by day. In two production teams, more than 80 mu of land suitable for summer planting has not been cultivated or sown to this day; a plot of potato land has not been cultivated since it was planted. In short, they are not active in accumulating fertilizer, plowing, planting, eliminating wasteland, or eliminating pests. This is not an isolated case here.
    I suggest that higher authorities control those who do not abide by the labor discipline of agricultural cooperatives and arbitrarily go out to do business:
    (1) Increase the tax rate so that their daily income does not exceed the labor day value of a general agricultural cooperative;
    (2) Do not issue them grain purchase certificates; if grain certificates are issued, price them differently, not the same as the grain purchase price for working farmers.
    I believe that the socialist transformation in agriculture cannot only talk about the democratic aspect, but also strengthen political and ideological leadership and economic management. Letting things go unchecked without leadership will not lead to good results.

### 限制社员不务农业去经商的活动

　　限制社员不务农业去经商的活动
    目前我们这里不少农业社，苦于劳力不能统一使用。如任丘县后李花村，耕地三千二百多亩。去年因遭受严重灾害，只剩耕畜八十九头，损失了25％。因此，只有对土地加劲操作，才能赶上往年的生产水平。可是，有五十六名精力强壮的人常年不参加农业生产而出外经商。骑自行车经商的十五人，其余是肩挑推车贩运。加之供应粮价便宜，该村商贩王恩说：“不下地，不上场，有钱一样把麦子向家扛！”参加农业社劳动的，每天收入却很少。因此，农民厌农的思想则日益上升。有两个生产队，适合夏播的地有八十余亩，至今没有耕播；有一块土豆地，自种上没有中耕过。总之，对积肥、耕播、灭荒、除虫，他们都不是积极的。这在我们这里还不是个别情况。
    我建议上级对不遵守农业社劳动纪律、任意出外经商的人予以控制：
    （1）增加税率，使他们一天所得不超过一般农业社的劳动日值；
    （2）不发给他们购粮证；如果发粮证，另定价钱，不与劳动农民购粮价相同。
    我认为，对农业上的社会主义改造，不能光讲民主的一面，还要加强政治思想上的领导和经济上的管理。放任自流，不加领导，就不会有好的结果。
