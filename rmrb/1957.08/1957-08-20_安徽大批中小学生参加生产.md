    Large Numbers of Middle and Primary School Students in Anhui Participate in Production

    (Our Dispatch from Anhui) Party and government leaders at all levels in Anhui Province and relevant departments have arranged production and self-study for more than 80,000 (currently incomplete statistics) middle and primary school graduates who cannot continue their education. They have successively begun to take up their respective posts. This year, leaders at all levels in Anhui Province have transferred a large number of cadres to specifically guide graduates in their further education and employment, provide correct education to students and parents, and arrange production and self-study for graduates who cannot continue their education. Hefei City has initially arranged 2,156 people, and Anqing City has arranged 1,500 people. In addition to organizing students for self-study, the two cities have also arranged for them to participate in service industries and work in suburban agriculture and vegetable cooperatives.
