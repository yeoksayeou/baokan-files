Xinhua News Agency, August 24th – Following the decisive victory in Beijing's Anti-Rightist Struggle, Party organizations in factories, enterprises, the construction industry, and the commercial and financial systems have recently begun to continue in-depth rectification. In the suburban areas, 840,000 farmers have also launched large-scale socialist education movements.

　　The rectification of Party organizations in factories, mines, construction enterprises, and commercial and financial systems mainly involves mobilizing the broad masses of workers and staff to offer opinions on various existing problems in enterprises through extensive airing of views, so as to effectively improve work and further improve socialist enterprises. To ensure that rectification and production/operation are not hindered, leading cadres of each unit have appropriately divided labor between rectification and production/operation, and have also appropriately scheduled time for rectification and production/operation within the enterprise. During the rectification process, each unit will pay special attention to strengthening education on labor discipline to ensure the smooth completion of production/operation tasks. At the same time, they will actively implement the spirit of "rectifying while correcting," and promptly resolve problems raised by workers and staff that are urgent and can be resolved.

　　In factories, mines, and construction enterprises, as of today, over 50,000 people from sixteen factories and mines, including the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the Shijingshan Power Plant, and the Jingxi Mining Bureau, and many construction companies have listened to rectification mobilization reports from the responsible comrades of the Party committees of their respective units and have held group discussions. Other enterprises and units will also begin to do so in the coming days.

　　In the previous period, leading cadres of these factories, mines, and construction enterprises had preliminarily made some improvements to work that could be immediately improved based on the opinions of workers and staff. Many leading cadres at all levels of enterprises regularly go deep into factories, mines, and construction sites to carry out production together with the workers, thus gaining a better understanding of some of the problems in production. Therefore, when the rectification movement was announced among the workers and staff, it was immediately warmly supported by the broad masses, who posted big-character posters one after another. Some criticized the shortcomings in the Party organization's implementation of policies, some criticized specific problems in production and work, some raised some problems in living welfare, and some criticized the poor work style of individual Party members or Party member leading cadres. Within five days of the mobilization meeting, the workers and staff of the state-owned Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, in addition to extensively airing views through group meetings, symposiums, and other forms, posted more than 270 big-character posters of various kinds in the courtyards, dining halls, and corridors. Many workers and staff brewed ideas for writing big-character posters in twos and threes after work. Big-character posters have become an important form of expression of opinions widely adopted by the workers and staff. In addition, the Party committees of many enterprises also widely collect the opinions of workers and staff through various meetings, various organizations, and "Trade Union Life Days" to allow everyone to speak their minds freely.

　　More than 10,000 grassroots business outlets in Beijing's commercial, service industries, and financial systems will undergo rectification in batches. In the past ten days or so, cadres in various departments of Beijing's largest store, Wangfujing Department Store, have posted more than 400 cartoons and big-character posters. One big-character poster criticized the leadership for not earnestly implementing the decision to streamline institutions and reduce layers, resulting in three levels of responsible persons in addition to the group leader in the store's storage and transportation group. Based on the criticism in the big-character poster regarding the fact that mooncakes were out of stock before the Mid-Autumn Festival last year and that more than 8,000 jin were overstocked after the festival, resulting in losses, the administrative leadership of this store has immediately begun to address this year's mooncake supply problem. Party organizations of various commercial companies and many commercial units in Chongwen District have now begun the rectification movement.

　　In the rural areas of the suburbs, the peasants are working hard in the fields to welcome the autumn harvest while actively launching a large-scale socialist education movement.

　　A week ago, the socialist education movement in the rural suburbs had begun in eight pilot townships. The farmers in each pilot township have been holding discussion meetings by production team or production group, using breaks in the fields and resting time after dinner. More than 200 Party member cadres and township/commune cadres who went to the countryside to help with the work conducted individual talks or visits with the farmers, and combined the specific situation of the township to mobilize members of all classes to air their views and opinions on the superiority of cooperation, the issue of unified purchase and sale, the relationship between workers and peasants, and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, in order to launch a large-scale debate on the issues of the socialist and capitalist roads in the future.

　　In the extensive airing of views in the past few days in each pilot township, the vast majority of speakers expressed satisfaction with all the socialist measures in the countryside and the good life they brought to them. A few people raised different opinions, and many others, starting from maintaining the collective interests, criticized the shortcomings in the operation and management of the cooperatives and the style of the cadres.

　　The Beijing Daily editorial of the day before yesterday pointed out that this socialist education is to distinguish between major rights and wrongs in the countryside. Therefore, it is necessary to adhere to the spirit of seeking truth from facts, distinguish between shortcomings in work, capitalist tendencies, and intentional sabotage activities. The number of overt counter-revolutionary activities is now extremely small, but it should not be neglected in the slightest, and must be resolutely counterattacked in a timely manner. At present, the main problem is to thoroughly criticize capitalist ideology in the countryside through debate, and at the same time, the shortcomings in the work of the cooperatives also need to be corrected through this movement.

　　The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has successively drawn nearly 2,000 cadres, teachers, staff, and university students from agencies and schools to participate in the socialist education movement in the suburban areas.

### 反右派斗争取得决定性胜利后　首都工商业系统继续整风　郊区农民展开大规模社会主义教育运动

　　反右派斗争取得决定性胜利后
　　首都工商业系统继续整风
  　郊区农民展开大规模社会主义教育运动
    新华社24日讯　北京市反右派斗争取得决定性胜利之后，全市各工厂企业、建筑业和商业财经系统的党组织最近又开始继续深入整风，郊区八十四万农民也分别展开了大规模的社会主义教育运动。
    各厂矿、建筑企业和商业财经系统党组织的整风，主要是发动广大职工群众，通过大鸣大放，对企业中存在的各种问题提出意见，以便有效地改进工作，进一步办好社会主义企业。为使整风和生产、经营两不误，各单位的领导干部已把整风和生产、经营作了适当分工，同时也在企业内部适当地安排了整风和从事生产、经营的时间。在整风过程中，各单位都将特别注意加强劳动纪律的教育，以保证生产、经营任务的顺利完成。同时积极贯彻执行边整边改的精神，对职工群众提出的一些问题，凡急需而又可能加以解决的，要迅速予以解决。
    在厂矿建筑企业里，到今天为止，已有石景山钢铁厂、石景山发电厂、京西矿务局等十六个厂矿和许多建筑公司的五万多人分别听取了各单位党委负责人的整风动员报告，并分组进行了酝酿讨论，其他各企业单位也将在日内开始进行。
    这些厂矿建筑企业的领导干部，在前一个时期内已经初步地根据职工群众的意见，对一些可以立即改进的工作分别作了若干改进。许多企业的各级领导干部，都定期深入到厂矿工地和工人一道进行生产，从而较多地了解了生产中的一些问题。因此，当整风运动在职工中宣布后，就立即受到广大群众的热烈拥护，纷纷贴出大字报，有的批评党组织执行政策中的缺点，有的批评了生产和工作中的具体问题，有的提出了生活福利中的一些问题，有的批评个别党员或党员领导干部的作风不好。国营北京第二棉纺织厂职工在动员会后的五天之内，除通过小组会、座谈会等形式大鸣大放外，在庭院、食堂和过道里张贴了二百七十多张形形色色的大字报，许多职工一下班就三三两两地酝酿写大字报。大字报成为职工群众普遍采用的发表意见的一个重要形式。此外，许多企业的党委还通过各种会议，各种不同的组织和“工会生活日”等广泛地搜集职工的意见，使大家畅所欲言。
    北京市一万多个商业、服务性行业和财经系统的基层营业点将分批进行整风。北京最大的商店——王府井百货商店的各科室干部在最近十多天内，已贴出四百多张漫画和大字报。一张大字报上批评领导上没有认真贯彻执行精简机构、减少层次的决定，使得商店中的储运组在组长之外出现了三层负责人。这个商店的行政领导上根据大字报上批评去年中秋节前月饼脱销、节后积压八千多斤以致造成损失的事实，已经立即着手解决今年的月饼供应问题。现在各商业公司和崇文区许多商业单位的党组织都已开始整风运动。
    在郊区农村里，农民们一面紧张地从事田间劳动，迎接秋季的丰收，一面在积极展开大规模的社会主义教育运动。
    在一周以前，郊区农村的社会主义教育运动已在八个试点乡中展开，各试点乡的农民们都以生产队或生产小组为单位，利用地头间歇和晚饭后乘凉休息时间开座谈会。下乡帮助工作的二百多名党员干部和各乡、社干部，对农民进行了个别交谈或访问，就合作化优越性问题、统购统销问题、工农关系问题、肃反问题，结合本乡具体情况，发动各阶层成员大鸣大放，提意见，发议论，以便在以后一定时期内就社会主义和资本主义两条道路的问题展开大辩论。
    各试点乡在最近几天的大放大鸣中，绝大多数发言的人对农村中的一切社会主义措施和给他们带来的美好生活都表示满意，少数人提出不同的意见，还有很多人从维护集体利益出发，就合作社的经营管理和干部作风上存在的缺点提出了批评。
    前天的北京日报在社论中指出，这次社会主义教育，是要辨明农村中的大是大非。因此，必须坚持实事求是的精神，分清哪些是工作上的缺点，哪些是资本主义倾向，哪些是有意的破坏活动。现在公开的反革命活动为数是极少的，但是也不容丝毫忽视，必须及时坚决地给予回击。目前主要的问题，是要通过辩论，彻底批判农村中的资本主义思想，同时，对合作社工作中的缺点，也需要通过这次运动加以改正。
    中共北京市委已经先后从机关学校中抽调了将近二千名干部、教职员、大学生到各郊区参加农村中的社会主义教育运动。
