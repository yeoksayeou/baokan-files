    Xinhua News Agency, 6th Dispatch: The over 80 million mu of cotton fields across the country have generally entered the peak boll-forming period. In another twenty days to a month, the harvest can begin.
    This year, thanks to timely sowing and well-distributed rainfall, the cotton in various regions, with the exception of cotton fields affected by disasters and cotton in the Xinjiang region growing slower than usual due to climate, is growing very well. The flowering and boll-forming times are also about ten days earlier than last year. Currently, cotton plants in various regions generally have three to six bolls, with some having more than eight.
    According to typical investigations in many major cotton-producing provinces and regions, there is a good chance of achieving increased cotton production, provided there are no special natural disasters in the future. In large cotton fields in Jiangling, Tianmen, Huangmei and other counties in Hubei Province, each cotton plant generally already has seven or eight old cotton bolls, and most cotton fields along the lake in Jianli and other areas also have five or six formed bolls. This situation is better than in 1956, a year of good harvest in this province. The cotton growth in some areas of Shandong Province is also rare since 1950. The more than 8 million mu of cotton in the Lu Xi and North Plain, which are currently flowering and forming bolls, are expected to have a good harvest. The more than 5 million mu of cotton in southern and central Shanxi Province are also growing better than in the good harvest year of 1953. Cotton in other areas such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shaanxi are also growing better than last year.

### 播种适时　雨水调和  各地棉花大都比去年长得好

    播种适时　雨水调和
    各地棉花大都比去年长得好
    据新华社6日讯　全国八千多万亩棉花已普遍进入结铃盛期。再过二十天到一个月就可收获。
    今年各地棉花由于播种适时，加上雨水调和，因此除受灾棉田及新疆地区棉花因气候关系生长迟于往年外，其余各省、区的棉花生育状况都非常好，开花结铃的时间也都比去年早十天左右。现在，各地棉株一般已结铃三个到六个，多的达八个以上。
    据许多主要产棉省、区的典型调查，只要今后无特殊的自然灾害，争取获得棉花增产是很有希望的。湖北省江陵、天门、黄梅等县大片棉田的每株棉花一般都已有七八个老棉桃，监利等沿湖棉田大都也有五六个成铃。这种情况就比这个省丰收的1956年为好。山东省有些地区的棉花生长情况也是1950年以来所少有的。正在开花结铃的鲁西、北平原八百多万亩棉花，都丰收可望。山西省晋南、晋中五百多万亩棉花的生长情况也胜过丰收的1953年。其他如江苏、浙江和陕西等地的棉花也都比去年长得好。
