"The Flower of a Famous General Withers on the Taihang Mountains"
——Remembering the Battle of Huangtuling Where Lieutenant General Abe Norihide, Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army's "Mongolia-Manchukuo Garrison," Was Killed
Yang Chengwu, General of the Chinese People's Liberation Army

In November 1939, the Japanese "Asahi Shimbun" newspaper in Tokyo opened a special column to mourn the "glorious sacrifice" of Lieutenant General Abe Norihide, Supreme Commander of the Japanese invading army's "Mongolia-Manchukuo Garrison" and commander of the Mixed 2nd Brigade, in the Huangtuling Campaign in Chahar Province. One article, titled "The Flower of a Famous General Withers on the Taihang Mountains," wrote in a weeping and complaining tone:

"Since the establishment of the Imperial Army, there has been no precedent for the sacrifice of a lieutenant general. The solemn sacrifice of Lieutenant General Abe Norihide this time makes us know that the soldiers must have fought very bravely, and the combat power has exceeded the distinction of rank."

Lieutenant General Abe Norihide was a famous Japanese tactician, "loyal and devoted" to the Japanese Emperor's hegemony and "made outstanding military achievements," thus obtaining the title of "Flower of a Famous General" from the Japanese warlords. However, the "famous flower" among the fascist generals, after all, could not withstand the impact of the storm of the Chinese people's national liberation struggle, and finally "the flower fell and the petals shattered," dying with regret in the Taihang Mountains.

The poet Tian Jian wrote a poem "Taking Flowers on Horseback" after the victory of the Huangtuling Campaign. The lines "In the Battle of Huangtuling, the 'Flower of a Famous General' died coughing up blood" and "A clumsy general takes flowers, collapses before taking them; a famous general takes flowers, takes them immediately on horseback" have always been vividly imprinted in my mind. The Battle of Huangtuling was eighteen years ago, but the heroic scene of the Chinese people's famous general—the Eighth Route Army—hunting this "flower of a famous general" is still vivid in my mind.

The Annihilation Battle of Yansukou

On October 30, 1939, I was in Fuping, Western Hebei, attending an organizational work conference organized by the Jin-Cha-Ji Branch Bureau. That evening, I received a report from my sub-district headquarters: Lieutenant General Abe Norihide, stationed in Zhangjiakou, sent Colonel Komura, leading more than 1,000 Japanese and puppet troops, to station in Laiyuan. According to reconnaissance, the enemy planned to divide into three routes to sweep our sub-district's Genfangzhen, Zouma驛, and Huibao areas. Their main force, two infantry companies, one artillery company, and some puppet troops, a total of more than 600 people under the command of Colonel Komura, showed signs of sweeping towards our Genfangzhen area via Longhu Village, Baishikou, and Bizi Ridge, attempting to eliminate our troops active in the Genfang area.

The enemy's actions were within our expectations. The Laiyuan area was a strategic location that both we and the enemy had to fight for. We could deploy troops from both sides of Laiyuan, north through Chahar Province, directly attacking Lieutenant General Abe Norihide's lair—Zhangjiakou. On the enemy's side, the strongholds on the Zhangjiakou-Laiyuan line were regarded as a "sharp knife" inserted into our Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region, attempting to use this "sharp knife" to cut off our Pingxi, Chahar, and Yanbei base areas to prevent our attack on Zhangjiakou, and to consolidate its occupied area in southern Chahar. Therefore, the enemy frequently stationed heavy troops in Laiyuan, using it as a base to constantly sweep us. At the end of September, the enemy had already started a trial autumn sweep from the southern line, sending out more than 800 troops to invade Chenzhuang in our Fourth Sub-district, but ended up with the entire army annihilated. Now, the enemy had started its retaliatory sweep on the northern line.

We had made full preparations for crushing the enemy's autumn sweep. The troops had been reorganized, especially the victory of annihilating more than 800 enemies in Chenzhuang, which strongly encouraged the troops in our sub-district, who proposed one after another: "Learn from the brother troops who fought in Chenzhuang, we also want to fight an annihilation battle," "Celebrate the second anniversary of the establishment of the Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region with the victory of crushing the enemy's autumn sweep." Faced with this "fat meat" that was delivered to our door, our commanders and fighters would certainly not let it go easily. At the same time, we had many favorable conditions for fighting in this area.

Laiyuan was the first county town liberated by our Eighth Route Army after entering the enemy's rear. It had a strong Party organization and had withstood the brutal sweeps of the enemy's thirteen routes in 1937 and the autumn offensive in 1938. The masses had a high fighting spirit and rich fighting experience. It was only occupied by the enemy at the end of autumn in 1938, but the rural government around the county town was still completely controlled by us. Even in the city, we had hidden organizations and intelligence networks. As soon as the enemy made any movement, we could immediately grasp it. These favorable mass conditions formed an "invisible Great Wall" for the struggle against the enemy, giving us "clairvoyance" and "clairaudience," and putting the enemy in a passive and beaten situation.

From a topographical point of view, this area was an ancient battlefield where our country had resisted the invasion of national enemies throughout the ages. It is connected to Zijing Pass in the east, Pingxing Pass and Yanmen Pass in the west, and in the south, the magnificent Inner Great Wall spans the White Stone Mountains. The Six Lang Peak and Six Lang Temple commemorating the national hero Yang Liulang stand on the Arrow-Inserting Ridge on the side of the Inner Great Wall in the White Stone Mountains. There is only one mountain road from Laiyuan to Genfang. Once past the Inner Great Wall, it is a bare and steep stone mountain. From Baishikou to the Yansukou section, both sides are high mountains that insert into the clouds, and the middle is a riverbed only forty to fifty meters wide, which is a natural pocket. If the troops are ambushed on both sides and the entrance of Baishikou is blocked, the enemy will not be able to get out once they enter, and they will not be able to escape even if they have wings. They will only be captured.

Based on these conditions, after research, we formulated a basic combat plan. It was decided to adopt ambush tactics, concentrate our forces to annihilate the enemy invading the Baishikou-Genfang line, and the ambush point was selected near Yansukou, and immediately asked Commander Nie Rongzhen of the Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region for instructions.

Commander Nie approved our combat plan. In order to ensure that the enemy was eliminated, he decided to have the main force, the First, Second, and Third Regiments, participate in the battle, and ordered me to immediately return to the sub-district to organize and command this battle.

On November 1st, I rushed back to the sub-district headquarters—Guantou—from Fuping. On the way through Genfang, I further discussed the combat plan with Comrade Ji Tingxie, commander of the Third Regiment, and Comrade Yuan Shengping, political commissar, who were stationed in Genfang, and instructed the regiments to act according to the plan. On the way back to Guantou from Genfang, the main peak of Yansukou strongly attracted my attention. This mountain peak appeared infinitely beautiful in our eyes, but in the face of national enemies, it would spew out thousands of fierce fires and burn them to ashes.

On November 2nd, we held a cadre meeting at the sub-district headquarters to specifically study how to strike the enemy. We decided to use part of the main force and local guerrillas to contain and block the enemy at the Arrow-Inserting Ridge and Huibao, with the Second Regiment led by Regiment Commander Tang Zian and Political Commissar Huang Wenming, and the Third Regiment led by Regiment Commander Ji Tingxie and Political Commissar Yuan Shengping, respectively ambushed on the east and west sides of Yansukou, with a part of the guerrillas luring the enemy deep into Baishikou. After the enemy entered the ambush circle, the First Regiment, led by Regiment Commander Chen Zhengxiang and Political Commissar Wang Daobang, would insert from the northeast to block the enemy's retreat. After the meeting, the cadres went to check the terrain, and the troops immediately entered battle positions.

On the morning of November 3rd, the sky was clear and the morning glow reddened the peaks, making the Taihang Mountains particularly magnificent. At about 7 o'clock, our army and the three routes of enemies started fighting successively. The enemy at Baishikou, under the lure and attack of our guerrillas, frantically advanced towards Sanchakou. When the enemy reached Yansukou, our Second and Third Regiments suddenly pressed down from the east and west sides of the mountains, and the First Regiment killed from behind the enemy, and more than 200 light and heavy machine guns fired at the enemy at the foot of the mountain. The sound of grenade explosions and shouts of killing shook the mountains. The enemy, obviously panicked by this sudden attack, still occupied the small high ground near the riverbed and stubbornly resisted, and under the cover of machine guns and artillery, organized five counterattacks against our Third Regiment's position. The commanders and fighters of the Third Regiment bravely fought back with grenades and bayonets. The First and Second Regiments fiercely swept from the flanks of the enemy, causing the enemy to fall down the mountain slopes. Then we launched a full-scale attack. By 4 pm, most of the enemy had been killed or wounded and were compressed near Shang and Xia Zhuangzi and a high ground in the northwest of Yansukou.

Before dusk, the enemy in Shang and Xia Zhuangzi was wiped out, leaving only the enemy on the northwest high ground. At this time, our troops gathered at the foot of the high ground, surrounding the enemy. Thousands of shiny bayonets shone with golden light under the afterglow of the setting sun. The enemy artillery on the top of the mountain frantically bombarded us; making a dying wail, the peaks were shrouded in blue smoke.

The First Battalion of the Third Regiment was responsible for the main attack on this mountain. Battalion Commander Lai Qingyao commanded from the forefront. As soon as the bugle for the charge sounded, the branch secretary of the Third Company took off his cotton-padded clothes and pants, raised his Mauser pistol, shouted, and led the whole company like a gust of wind up the mountain, pushing the enemy down. Suddenly, a volley of 60mm mortar shells flew over, and the mountain became a sea of fire. The enemy counterattacked, and the warriors of the Third Company were pushed down to the mountainside. Before long, the sound of killing shook the mountainside, and the Third Company rushed up again, controlling the entire mountain. The enemy, struggling before death, launched another counterattack with all their strength, and a fierce bayonet fight unfolded on the mountain. The branch secretary was wounded several times and covered in blood, but still waved the blood-stained Mauser pistol, commanding the troops to fight the devils. However, because the follow-up troops did not arrive in time, the warriors were pushed down the mountain again.

The setting sun had set in the west, and the mountain was hazy. Could we still let the remaining enemies continue to struggle frantically? The third charge began immediately. Cao Baoquan's platoon, nicknamed the "Sick Platoon," also joined the battle. The sound of the charge bugle echoed through the valley, and bullets poured down on the enemy's position like a torrential rain. The enemy fell one after another at the muzzle of sharpshooter Meng Xianrong's machine gun. Ji Tingxie, the regimental commander who was standing beside him and commanding, shouted loudly: "Good, sharpshooter, beat them hard!" Then he raised his arm and shouted: "Comrades, charge!" Following the regimental commander's shout, Platoon Leader Cao Baoquan led the entire platoon like they were possessed and rushed to the head of the charging队伍, rushing up to the top of the mountain in an instant, and the large forces rushed up like a raging tide. The enemy was pushed down to the bottom of the ditch, and grenades poured down into the ditch like hailstones, and the devils were engulfed by thick smoke and raging fire. All of the more than 600 Japanese and puppet troops, except for 13 captured alive, were annihilated in the riverbed.

While cleaning the battlefield, Colonel Komura, who was seriously injured, was found in the pile of enemy corpses. He still wanted to maintain the "face" of the Imperial Army and would not let our medical personnel bandage or rescue him. Later, he died on Yansukou due to his serious injuries. The remaining enemies on the other two routes, intimidated by the power of our army, fled in panic and shrank back to Laiyuan City.

Abe Norihide Dies With Regret at Huangtuling

The annihilation battle of Yansukou completely disgraced the Imperial Army. It made Lieutenant General Abe Norihide, who was known as the "Flower of a Famous General," furious. On November 4th, he mobilized more than 1,000 troops from Zhangjiakou, led by himself, and rushed to Laiyuan in hundreds of trucks, following the old road of Colonel Komura, to carry out a retaliatory sweep against us. He attempted to ambush us again at Yansukou, and use his superior forces to counterattack us, eliminate our main force, then rush directly to Genfang, and then take Zouma驛 to the west or advance eastward to the Huangtuling and Zhai Tuo area to implement the "Three Alls" policy, in order to save the "face" of the Imperial Army and consolidate its occupied area in southern Chahar. I immediately reported this situation to Commander Nie on the phone.

Commander Nie was determined to let this "famous tactician" appreciate the strategic and tactical thinking of Chairman Mao's revolutionary guerrilla warfare and give him a surprise. He instructed us to use a small force to meet the enemy in the Baishikou area and lead the enemy to Genfang, let them find nothing, and then hide to confuse the enemy. Then, a part of the guerrillas should attack northeast of Genfang to lure the enemy east, and when the enemy reached the favorable terrain of the Huangtuling area, concentrate the main force to encircle and annihilate them. In addition to the First, Second, Third, and Twenty-fifth Regiments and the artillery battalion, Commander Nie also ordered the Special Service Regiment of the 120th Division to go north from Shennan and come under our command to participate in this battle.

The troops immediately carried out another mobilization for battle. The battle slogans "Give Lieutenant General Abe Norihide a Surprise" and "Fight another Annihilation Battle" strongly struck the heartstrings of the commanders and fighters.

On November 5th, more than 1,000 enemies advanced from Longhu Village to Baishikou. The guerrilla detachment commanded by Comrade Zeng Yongya engaged the enemy at Baishikou. Using clever tactics of firmly blocking and then retreating by big steps, they tightly entangled the enemy, making the enemy unable to fight when they wanted to, and unable to catch up when they chased, making them furious. After arriving at Genfang, they could only vent their anger with the "Three Alls" policy. That night, the raging fire in the Genfang area burned all night long.

Lieutenant General Abe Norihide was eager to find our main force for a decisive battle. The next day, he mobilized his troops to rush eastward to Huangtuling. We let go of the long line to catch the big fish, without disturbing them at all, and let them "safely" camp in the Sigezhuang area of Huangtuling. At this time, our First and Twenty-fifth Regiments gathered in the Zhai Tuo and Meidoudian area, blocking the enemy's retreat. The Third Regiment and the Special Service Regiment set out from Daan and occupied the high mountains south of Huangtuling and Shangzhuangzi. The Second Regiment detoured to the northwest of Huangtuling and followed the enemy, forming an encirclement of the enemy.

That night, Huangtuling was dark and silent like a tomb. The cold wind blowing from the Taihang Mountains made a rustling sound, as if tolling the death knell for the fascist bandits.

On the 7th, Huangtuling was drizzling with rain, and the peaks were covered with white mist. At dawn, the enemy continued to advance eastward. At 12 noon, they advanced to Shangzhuangzi, and the vanguard had reached near Zhai Tuo. At 3 pm, their tail had left Huangtuling. At this time, our First and Twenty-fifth Regiments killed out to block them, and the Third Regiment, the Special Service Regiment, and the Second Regiment attacked together from the west, south, and north, surrounding the enemy and compressing them into a mountain valley about two kilometers long and only a hundred meters wide near Shangzhuangzi. Hundreds of light and heavy machine guns spewed bullets that poured down on the enemy's heads like a storm, and the artillery troops also bombarded the densely packed enemy at the bottom of the valley with fierce artillery fire. Huangtuling was ablaze with fire, and the smoke filled the sky.

Relying on its strong military force, the enemy charged our Zhai Tuo position, attempting to break out of our encirclement. After being resolutely repulsed by us, they turned around and broke through towards Huangtuling, attempting to flee back to Laiyuan. Our Third Regiment, Special Service Regiment, and Second Regiment tightly controlled the mouth of the pocket and forced the enemy to retreat step by step.

The battle was going on fiercely. The troops had been fighting continuously for days, unable to eat well or sleep well, and the number of wounded was gradually increasing. The masses of the First and Third sub-districts were all mobilized to assist our army in combat. The militia were dispatched to guard, alert, and scout out enemy movements. The young and strong formed stretcher teams to rush to the front line to transport the wounded, and the women carried hot cornbread and boiled water to our front-line combat troops. The upsurge of mass participation in the war greatly encouraged our army's determination and confidence in annihilating the enemy.

The battlefield hospital was also busy carrying out first aid and bandaging to the wounded. Wherever Dr. Bethune appeared, the wounded would feel unparalleled warmth. This international communist fighter and Canadian communist party member had been fighting alongside us for a long time. With his sincere love for communism and the cause of human liberation, and with his superb medical skills, he had cured many of our comrades. On the eve of the Yansukou battle, he led the surgical team from the military region to participate in the battle. Late at night, he still asked me to introduce the combat plan to him, study the work of rescuing the wounded on the battlefield, and immediately rushed to the battlefield to work day and night to perform surgery on our seriously wounded. When he finished treating the wounded of the Yansukou battle, the sound of artillery had already been heard on Huangtuling, and he immediately took the surgical team to the Ganhejing sub-district hospital. Just as he was about to leave, he suddenly discovered that a wounded soldier with a head injury was infected with bile poison. If he did not perform surgery immediately, his life would be in danger. In order to rescue this wounded soldier, he immediately unloaded the surgical instruments that had been tied to the livestock and performed surgery on the wounded soldier. After rescue, the wounded soldier was safely out of danger, but he caused the wound on his original hand to be fatally infected. Although various methods were used to treat him, he finally died gloriously. The news immediately spread throughout the entire battlefield. Dr. Bethune's deep hatred for the fascist enemy and his selfless spirit of serving his class comrades inspired and inspired our commanders and fighters.

Under the enthusiastic support of the masses and the inspiring spirit of Dr. Bethune, the troops launched a full-scale fierce attack on the enemy. After repeated charges and killings, they compressed them into the mountain valley near Shangzhuangzi. This was a great opportunity to exert the power of our artillery. Yang Jiucheng, the artillery battalion commander, immediately ordered the artillery group to fire intensively into the valley. The mountains shook, and the enemy at the bottom of the valley screamed in despair. Lieutenant General Abe Norihide, the "flower of a famous general," "fell and shattered" under the volley of our brave mortar artillery. His yellow woolen coat embroidered with two gold stars and the gold-handled steel command knife also became our spoils of war. The "Asahi Shimbun" newspaper gave a detailed account of the embarrassing situation when the "flower of a famous general" was killed:

"When the Imperial Army was forced back by the enemy to Shangzhuangzi, the lieutenant general still went to the front line very decisively to observe the terrain and enemy situation. Suddenly, enemy mortar shells flew over and exploded a few steps away from the lieutenant general. Fragments hit the lieutenant general's left abdomen and legs, causing fatal injuries. He passed away at 9:50 pm."

After Abe was killed, the enemy was extremely panicked. On the morning of the 8th, five planes flew in and dropped off a few commanders to maintain the remaining situation at Huangtuling. We besieged until the afternoon of the 8th, and after eliminating more than 900 enemy main forces, just as we were besieging and annihilating the remaining enemies, the enemy launched a joint attack on Huangtuling from five routes with heavy troops from Lingqiu, Laiyuan, Tangxian County, Wanxian County, Yixian County, and Mancheng County, all advancing to about 30 miles away from Huangtuling, attempting to encircle and annihilate us and carry out a large-scale retaliatory sweep. In accordance with the instructions of the military region, we took the initiative to withdraw from Huangtuling, jumped out of the outer line, and turned to active anti-sweep struggles, constantly inflicting blows on the enemy from the flanks. By the end of November, the enemy finally could not withstand our attacks, and retreated in despair. We achieved a complete victory in the anti-sweep.

After nearly a month of anti-sweep struggle, the Taihang Mountains, burning with the flames of war, appeared particularly majestic at this moment. The "flower of a famous general" had withered in the Taihang Mountains, but the flower of the Chinese people's heroism and wisdom—the Eighth Route Army—bloomed with even more vivid and colorful姿态 in the Taihang Mountains.

The Lament of the Enemy Garrison Commander

After the fatal blows to the enemy in Yansukou and Huangtuling, and after Abe Norihide and Komura were successively killed by us, the Japanese, who were usually as fierce as wolves and accustomed to roaring, changed to the cunning face of a fox and uttered whimpering cries. A few days after the Huangtuling battle, the enemy garrison commander, Xiaochai, suddenly sent me a letter, which read:

"To Commander Yang: The war between China and Japan is a matter between the governments of China and Japan. You and I are both members of mankind and have no personal grudges. Participating in the war is only for the sake of eating. National disputes have nothing to do with us, and don't let this affect our friendship. Your troops are lucky in war and always victorious, and I admire you very much. Now I have two things to ask for: first, please inform me of the number, military rank, name, and current living conditions of the Imperial Army officers and soldiers who were captured alive by your troops in Huangtuling and Yansukou; second, have the Imperial Army officers and soldiers who died in battle been buried, where are they buried, and can we be allowed to retrieve their ashes? To comfort the heroic spirits."

We immediately replied to him, first exposing his nonsense that "national disputes have nothing to do with us," and pointing out that he himself was a tool of the Japanese fascist invasion of China and a deadly enemy of the entire Chinese nation. And told him: The Eighth Route Army has always treated prisoners leniently, and all enemies who have laid down their weapons are treated with leniency. They are living well and have begun to recognize the crimes of invading China and expressed their opposition to the war of aggression against China; for those who were made your "cannon fodder" and suffered the disasters you gave them, we have properly buried them and erected stone monuments to mark them....

The whimpering cries of the fascist bandits, of course, did not stir up our compassion at all. We struck the Japanese with even more active combat actions, and a more blazing flame of national liberation war was ignited in the Taihang Mountains. Let the evil Japanese tremble forever before the heroic Taihang Mountains!

    “名将之花雕谢在太行山上”
    ——忆击毙日军“蒙、疆驻屯军”最高司令阿部规秀中将的黄土岭战斗前后
    中国人民解放军上将　杨成武
    1939年11月，日本东京“朝日新闻”报辟一专栏哀悼日本侵华军“蒙、疆驻屯军”最高司令兼混成第二旅团旅团长阿部规秀中将在察南黄土岭战役“光荣牺牲”。其中一篇题为“名将之花雕谢在太行山上”的悼文里，如泣如怨地写道：
    “自从皇军成立以来，对中将级将官牺牲，是没有这个例子的。这次阿部规秀中将的隆重牺牲，我们知道，将士们一定是很奋力作战的，战斗力已超过了阶级的区分”。
    阿部规秀中将是日本的名战术家，对日本天皇的霸业“赤胆忠心，战功卓著”，因而取得了日本军阀给予的“名将之花”的称号。然而，法西斯将军中的“名花”，毕竟经不起中国人民民族解放斗争的风暴的冲击，终于“花落瓣碎”，饮恨在太行山上。
    诗人田间在黄土岭战役胜利后，写了一首“马上取花”的诗，“黄土岭一战，‘名将之花’，吐血而亡”和“拙将取花，未取先垮，名将取花，马上取花”的诗句，始终鲜明地烙印在我的脑海里。黄土岭之战，已是十八年前的事了，但是，中国人民的名将——八路军猎取这朵“名将之花”的英雄情景，依然历历在目。
    雁宿岩歼灭战
    1939年10月30日，我在冀西阜平参加晋察冀分局组织工作会议。当晚，接到了我分区司令部的报告：坐镇张家口的阿部规秀中将派出过村大佐，率领一千多日伪军进驻涞源，据侦悉敌寇拟分三路向我分区的艮方镇、走马馹、灰堡地区扫荡，其主力两个步兵中队，一个炮兵中队及一部伪军共有六百余人由过村大佐指挥，有经龙虎村、白石口、鼻子岭向我艮方镇地区扫荡迹象，企图消灭在艮方一带活动之我军。
    敌人的这一行动，早在我们的意料之中。涞源地区是敌我必争之地。我们可从涞源两侧经察南挥兵北上，直捣阿部规秀中将的老窝——张家口。在敌人方面，则把张家口——涞源一线的据点，看成是插进我晋察冀军区的一把“尖刀”，企图用这把“尖刀”，把我平西、察南、雁北根据地割裂，以阻挡我向张家口进击，企图巩固其察南占领区，因而敌寇在涞源常驻重兵，并以此为基点，不断向我扫荡。9月底，敌人已从南线开始秋季扫荡的尝试，出动八百多兵力进犯我四分区之陈庄，但落得个全军复没的下场。现在，敌人又在北线开始其报复性的扫荡了。
    对于粉碎敌人的秋季扫荡，我们已做了充分的准备。部队已经过整训，特别是陈庄全歼敌人八百余人的胜利，强烈地鼓舞着我分区的部队，纷纷提出：“向陈庄作战的兄弟部队学习，我们也要来个歼灭战”，“用粉碎敌人秋季扫荡的胜利庆祝晋察冀军区建立二周年”。面对这块送上门来的“肥肉”，我们的指战员当然不会轻易放过。同时，在这一带地区作战，我们有许多有利条件。
    涞源是我八路军进入敌后最先解放的第一个县城，有坚强的党组织，经受过37年敌寇十三路的残酷扫荡和38年秋季大进攻的考验。群众斗争情绪高涨，斗争经验丰富，38年秋末才被敌人进占，但是县城周围的乡村政权仍完全被我控制，就是在城里我们也有隐蔽的组织及情报网。敌人一有动静，我们便能立即掌握。这些有利的群众条件，形成了对敌斗争的“无形长城”，使我们有了“千里眼”、“顺风耳”，陷敌人于被动挨打的窘境。
    从地形上看，这一带是我国历代抗御民族敌人入侵的古战场。东连紫荆关，西接平型关、雁门关，南面，雄伟的内长城横跨过白石山，纪念民族英雄杨六郎的六郎峰、六郎庙屹立在白石山脉内长城边的插箭岭上。从涞源到艮方只有一条山道，一过内长城，是光秃陡立的石山。从白石口到雁宿岩一段，两面是高插入云的大山，中间是一条宽仅四、五十公尺的河套，这是一个天然的口袋。如果把部队埋伏两边，再把白石口的口子堵住，管叫敌人进得来，出不去，插翅难逃，只有束手就歼。
    根据这些条件，经研究后，我们拟定了一个基本作战方案。决定采用伏击的战术手段，集中兵力歼灭向白石口——艮方一线进犯之敌，伏击点选择在雁宿岩附近，并立即请示晋察冀军区聂荣臻司令员。
    聂司令员批准了我们的作战方案，为了确有把握消灭敌人，决定以主力一、二、三团参战，并命令我立即回分区组织指挥这个战斗。
    11月1日，我从阜平赶回分区司令部——管头。途经艮方，与驻在艮方的三团团长纪庭谢、政委袁升平同志进一步研究作战方案，并指示各团按方案行动。在从艮方回管头的路上，雁宿岩的主峰强烈地吸引住我的视线。这山峰，在我们的眼前显得无限秀丽，然而她在民族敌人的面前却会喷射出万道烈火，把他们烧成粉身碎骨。
    11月2日，我们在分区司令部召开了干部会议，具体研究怎样打击敌人。我们决定以部分主力和地方游击队牵制堵击插箭岭、灰堡之敌，以第二团由团长唐子安政委黄文明率领，第三团由团长纪庭谢、政委袁升平率领，分别埋伏于雁宿岩东、西两面，以一部游击队在白石口诱敌深入，待敌进至伏击圈后，一团由团长陈正相政委王道邦率领，从东北插至白石口截住敌人的退路。会后，干部分头察看地形，部队立即进入战斗位置。
    11月3日清晨，晴空万里，朝霞映红了群峰，太行山显得格外壮丽。七时许，我军同三路敌人先后打响。白石口之敌在我游击队诱击下，疯狂地向三岔口前进。当敌进至雁宿岩时，我二、三团突然从东、西两面漫山遍野地压下来，一团则从敌人屁股后面杀出，二百多挺轻、重机枪一齐向山下的敌人开火。手榴弹爆炸声、喊杀声震得山岳颤抖。敌人遭此猝然打击，显然惊慌失措，但仍占领河套附近的小高地顽强抵抗，并以机枪大炮掩护，向我三团阵地组织五次反扑。三团的指战员们以手榴弹、刺刀奋勇迎击，一、二团从敌人侧背猛烈扫射，打得敌人纷纷滚落山坡。接着我们展开了全面攻击，至下午四时，敌人已被杀伤大半，被压缩在上、下庄子附近和雁宿岩西北的一个高地上。
    黄昏前，上、下庄子之敌被我消灭干净，只剩下西北高地上的敌人。这时，我各路部队集结高地下面，把敌人围的水泄不通。数千把雪亮的刺刀，在落日余辉的映照下，闪射出万道金光。山顶上的敌炮兵，疯狂地向我轰击；发出临死前的哀鸣，群峰被蓝烟笼罩着。
    三团一营担任对这个山头的主攻，营长赖庆尧在最前沿指挥。冲锋号一响，三连的支部书记脱下棉衣棉裤，高举驳壳枪，呐喊一声，领着全连像一股疾风刮上山头，把敌人压下去了。突然，一排六○炮弹飞来，山头成了火海，敌人反扑上来，三连的勇士们被压下山腰。不一会，山腰上杀声冲天，三连又冲上去了，控制了整个山头。临死挣扎的敌人，倾全力再次反扑上来，山头上展开了激烈的白刃战。支部书记身负数伤，浑身是血，仍挥动着染满鲜血的驳壳枪，指挥部队同鬼子搏斗。但因后续部队没及时赶到，勇士们又被压下山来。
    夕阳已西沉，山头一片蒙胧。难道还能让残存的敌人继续疯狂挣扎么？第三次冲锋立即开始。绰号“病号排”的曹葆全排也投入了战斗。冲锋号震荡山谷，枪弹像骤雨一样浇落敌人阵地。神枪手孟宪荣的机枪指处，敌人纷纷倒下。站在他旁边指挥的纪庭谢团长大声喝采：“好呀，神枪手狠狠地揍啊！”，紧接着他振臂一呼：“同志们冲呀！”随着团长的喊声，曹葆全排长领着全排像着了魔一样冲在冲锋队伍的头里，刹那间就冲上了山顶，大队如狂潮一样涌上去了。敌人被压下沟底，手榴弹像冰雹一样倾泻在沟里，鬼子被浓烟烈火吞噬了。六百多名日伪军除生俘十三名外，全部被消灭在河套里。
    打扫战场时，在敌尸堆中找到了重伤的过村大佐。他还要保持皇军的“体面”，不让我们的医务人员为他包扎、急救。后来因伤势过重，也死在雁宿岩上。其余二路的敌人，慑于我军威力，仓皇溃退，缩回涞源城去了。
    阿部规秀饮恨黄土岭
    雁宿岩歼灭战，丢尽了皇军的“体面”。使得号称“名将之花”的阿部规秀中将恼羞成怒，于11月4日，倾张家口之兵力一千余人，亲自率领，出动数百辆卡车急驰涞源，沿着过村大佐的旧路，向我进行报复性的扫荡。企图再让我在雁宿岩伏击，而以优势之兵力反击我们，消灭我们之主力，然后直扑艮方，再西取走马馹或东进黄土岭、寨坨一带实行“三光”，以挽回皇军的“体面”，巩固其察南占领区。我立即将此一情况在电话上向聂司令员报告。
    聂司令员决心让这个“名战术家”领略领略毛主席革命游击战争的战略战术，给他一个下马威。指示我们以小部兵力在白石口一带迎击敌人，把敌军引向艮方，让他们扑空，然后掩蔽起来，迷惑敌人。尔后以游击队一部在艮方东北出击，诱敌东进，待敌进至黄土岭一带有利地形，集中主力将之包围歼灭，除以一、二、三、二十五团和炮兵营等参战外，并命令一二○师特务团从神南北上归我们指挥，参加这次战斗。
    部队立即进行再战动员。“给阿部规秀中将一个下马威”，“再来一个歼灭战”的战斗口号，强烈地扣击着指战员的心弦。
    11月5日，一千多敌人从龙虎村向白石口前进，曾雍雅同志指挥的游击支队，在白石口与敌打响。以忽而坚堵，忽而大踏步后退的巧妙战术，紧紧缠住敌人，使敌人求战不能，追又追不上，气得暴跳如雷，到得艮方后，只能以“三光”泄愤。当晚，艮方一带，熊熊大火，彻夜不熄。
    阿部规秀中将因急于寻找我主力决战，次日即倾师东窜黄土岭。我们则放长线钓大鱼，丝毫不惊动他们，让他们“平安”地在黄土岭司各庄一带宿营。这时，我一团和二十五团在寨坨、煤斗店一带集结，卡住了敌人的去路，三团、特务团从大安出动，占领了黄土岭及上庄子以南高山，二团则绕至黄土岭西北尾随敌后前进，形成了对敌人的包围形势。
    是夜，黄土岭上黯然无光，寂如坟墓。从太行山上吹来的寒风发出嗖嗖的声响，好像为法西斯匪徒敲起了丧钟。
    七日，黄土岭上阴雨绵绵，群峰被白雾复盖着。拂晓，敌人继续东进，十二时进到上庄子，先头部队已到达寨坨附近，十五时，其尾巴已离开黄土岭。这时，我一团、二十五团拦头杀出，三团、特务团及二团从西、南、北面合击过来，把敌人团团围住，压缩在上庄子附近约二公里长宽仅百十公尺的山沟里。数百挺轻、重机枪喷射出的子弹像暴风骤雨一样倾泻在敌人头上，炮兵部队亦以猛烈的炮火轰击沟底密集的敌人。只打得黄土岭上火光闪闪，硝烟蔽天。
    敌人依仗其雄厚兵力，向我寨坨阵地冲击，企图跳出我包围圈。遭到我坚决反击后，乃掉头向黄土岭突围，企图回窜涞源。我三团、特务团和二团把口袋口紧紧扼住，并逼使敌人步步后撤。
    战斗在激烈地进行着，部队因连日奋战，吃不好饭，睡不好觉，伤员也逐渐增多。一、三分区的群众全部动员起来，协助我军作战，民兵悉数出动替我们放哨、警戒，侦察敌情，青壮年组成担架队到火线抢运伤员，妇女们挑着烫热的窝窝头、开水送给我一线作战部队。群众参战的热潮，大大鼓舞着我军歼敌的决心和信心。
    战地医院也紧张地进行着对伤员的急救、包扎。白求恩大夫出现在那里，那里的伤员就感受到无比的温暖。这位国际共产主义战士、加拿大共产党员，长期地和我们并肩作战，他以对共产主义和人类解放事业的赤诚，以他精湛的医术，治愈了我们许多同志。在雁宿岩战斗前夜，他带领着手术队从军区赶来参战，深夜了，他还要我向他介绍作战计划，研究战地抢救伤员的工作，并立即赶赴战地夜以继日的为我重伤员动手术。当他处理完雁宿岩战斗的伤员时，黄土岭上已传来了炮声，他立即带着手术队赶赴干河净分区医院。刚要动身，忽然发现一个头部负伤的伤员感染了胆毒，若不立即动手术，便有性命危险。为了抢救这个伤员，他立即卸下已绑在牲口上的手术器械，为这个伤员施行手术。经过抢救，这位伤员是安全脱险了，而他却因此使自己原来手上的伤口，受到致命的传染，虽然用尽各种方法医治，终于光荣牺牲。这消息立刻传遍整个战地，白求恩大夫对法西斯敌人的深沉仇恨，忘我的为阶级战友服务的崇高精神，感召着我们的指战员。
    部队在群众的热情支援和白求恩大夫的精神的鼓舞感召下，向敌人展开全面的激烈攻击。经过反复冲杀，把他们压缩在上庄子附近的山沟里。这是发挥我炮兵威力的大好时机，炮兵营长杨九秤立即命令炮群向沟里集火射击。只震得群山抖动，轰得沟底的敌人鬼哭狼号。阿部规秀中将这朵“名将之花”就在我们神勇的迫击炮兵的排炮下“花落瓣碎了”，他的绣着两颗金星的黄呢大衣和金把钢质的指挥刀也成了我们的战利品。这朵“名将之花”阵亡时的狼狈情形，“朝日新闻”报的那篇悼文有了详细的叙述：
    “皇军被敌人逼退到上庄子时，中将仍很果敢地到第一线观察地形、敌情。忽然，飞来了敌人的迫击炮弹，距中将数步的地方爆炸，破片打中了中将的左腹及两腿等数处，中了致命的伤，等到下午九时五十分遂与世长辞了。”
    阿部中将被击毙后，敌人恐慌异常，8日晨飞来了五架飞机投下几个指挥官维持黄土岭的残局。我围攻至8日下午，消灭了九百多敌人主力之后，正在围歼残敌之际，敌人以重兵从灵丘，涞源，唐县、完县，易县，满城分五路向黄土岭合击，均进至距黄土岭三十里左右，企图围歼我们，来个大规模的报复扫荡。我们遵照军区的指示，主动撤离黄土岭，跃出外线，转入积极的反扫荡斗争，不断从敌人侧背施予打击。至11月底，敌人终于经不起我们的打击，垂头丧气地全线溃退，我们取得了反扫荡的彻底胜利。
    经过了近一个月反扫荡斗争火焰燃烧的太行山，此刻显得格外威武。“名将之花”是雕谢在太行山上了，但是中国人民英勇、智慧之花——八路军却以更鲜艳多采的姿态盛开在太行山上。
    敌警备司令的哀鸣
    经过雁宿岩、黄土岭两次对敌寇的致命打击，阿部规秀中将和过村大佐相继被我们击毙以后，平时如狼似虎，咆哮惯了的日寇，却换成一副狐狸的狡猾脸孔，发出嘤嘤哀鸣之声。黄土岭战后不几天，敌警备司令小柴，突然给我一信，里面写道：
    “杨师长麾下：中、日之战是中、日两国政府之事，麾下与鄙人同是人类一分子，没有私仇，参加战争仅是为了吃饭。国家的争论与我们无关，别因此影响我们的友谊。麾下之部队武运亨通，长胜不败，鄙人极为钦佩。现鄙人有两件事情求教：一是请通知鄙人在黄土岭、雁宿岩被麾下部队生俘的皇军官兵的数目、军职、姓名及他们的生活近况；二是战死的皇军官兵是否埋葬，埋在何处，可否准予取回骨灰？以慰英灵。”
    我们立即回他一信，首先揭穿其所谓“国家之争论与我们无关”的胡说，指出他自己就是日本法西斯侵华的工具，是全中华民族的死敌。并告诉他：八路军一向优待俘虏，对于已放下武器的敌人，一律宽大处理。他们生活的很好，已开始认识侵华罪行，表示反对侵华战争；对于作了你们的“炮灰”，蒙受你们给予的灾难的战死者，我们已妥为埋葬，并立有石碑，以兹标志……。
    法西斯匪徒的嘤嘤哀鸣之声，当然丝毫牵动不起我们的怜悯之情。我们以更积极的战斗行动打击日寇，太行山上燃起了更加炽烈的民族解放战争的烽火。让万恶的日寇永远在英雄的太行山面前发抖吧！
