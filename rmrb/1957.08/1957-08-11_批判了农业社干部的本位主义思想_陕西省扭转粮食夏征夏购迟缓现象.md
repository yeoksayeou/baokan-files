Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 9th - After strengthening socialist ideological education for farmers, the slow progress in summer grain procurement in Shaanxi Province has been reversed. The average daily amount of wheat entering warehouses across the province in late July was more than 20 million jin, more than triple the daily amount in mid-July. As of August 5, the amount of wheat stored across the province has reached more than 52% of the state procurement target.

The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a special meeting of prefectural committee secretaries and county committee secretaries in the Guanzhong area in early July to focus on examining and criticizing the localism of cadres, and decided to strengthen education for farmers to overcome the erroneous idea of only caring about themselves and not the country. After the meeting, a propaganda campaign centered on promoting grain work was launched in rural areas. A large number of cadres from eighteen counties, including Nanzheng and Chenggu, went deep into the countryside to carry out socialist ideological education for farmers that took into consideration the interests of the state, the cooperative, and cooperative members. After calling on farmers to conscientiously implement the principle of building the country diligently and thriftily and managing their families diligently and thriftily, the number of procured grain entering warehouses in late July increased by 1.6 times compared to mid-July. After more than twenty agricultural cooperatives in Fuping and Huayin counties comprehensively carried out summer grain verification work, they not only left enough grain for ordinary cooperative members, appropriately distributed more grain to cooperative members who worked well, but also sold more than 470,000 jin of wheat to the state.

In addition, the exposure and crackdown on the destructive activities of illegal landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries in grain unified purchase and sales has also powerfully promoted the progress of summer grain storage.

    批判了农业社干部的本位主义思想
    陕西省扭转粮食夏征夏购迟缓现象
    新华社西安9日电　在加强对农民的社会主义思想教育后，陕西省夏粮征购工作进展迟缓现象已经得到扭转。全省7月下旬平均每天入仓小麦两千多万斤，比7月中旬每天入仓数增加两倍多。截至8月5日止，全省入仓小麦数量已达国家征购任务的52％以上。
    中共陕西省委员会在7月上旬曾就粮食问题专门召集全省地委书记和关中地区的县委书记开会，着重检查和批判了干部中的本位主义思想，并决定加强教育农民，克服只顾个人、不顾国家的错误想法。会后，一个以推动粮食工作为中心内容的宣传运动就在农村中展开。南郑、城固等十八个县大批干部深入农村向农民进行了国家、社和社员三方面兼顾的社会主义思想教育，号召农民认真贯彻执行勤俭建国、勤俭持家的原则以后，7月下旬征购粮入仓数就比中旬增加了一点六倍。富平、华阴两县的二十多个农业社全面进行了夏粮夏核工作以后，不仅给一般社员留够了口粮，给劳动好的社员适当多分了粮食，而且向国家多卖小麦四十七万多斤。
    此外，各地对不法地主、富农和反革命分子在粮食统购统销方面破坏活动的揭露和打击，也有力地推动了夏粮入仓工作的进展。
