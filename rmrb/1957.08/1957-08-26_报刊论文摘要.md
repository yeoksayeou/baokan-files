What Kind of Independent Thinking Do We Advocate?

	To have correct independent thinking, one must have a correct standpoint. Rightists clamor, "Having a standpoint negates independent thinking." In fact, the "independent thinking" of the rightists is merely the transportation of the theoretical dregs of the bourgeoisie, opportunism, and revisionism under the guise of beautiful slogans. The matter is very clear: in the current class society, if one does not think from the standpoint of the proletariat, one will inevitably think from the standpoint of the bourgeoisie or the landlord class.

	The correct standpoint is linked to correct viewpoints and correct methods of thinking. Marxism is our proletariat's scientific worldview and method of thinking; we use Marxism as our guiding ideology when thinking about and understanding problems. Rightists attack, saying, "Marxism puts a framework on thought, hindering independent thought." We all know that Marxism is the theoretical weapon guiding the working class in revolutionary struggle, and its purpose is to solve practical problems in the workers' revolutionary struggle. It itself has already made demands for independent thinking. If Marxism hindered independent thinking, how could Lenin have used Marxism to guide the Russian Revolution, not only achieving revolutionary victory but also developing Marxism? Under the guidance of Marxism, the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao have prescribed lines and policies suitable for China's national conditions on a series of fundamental issues in the Chinese revolution. Is this not also a model of independent thinking? (Excerpt from the August 23rd China Youth Daily editorial: "To have correct independent thinking, one must have correct standpoints, viewpoints, and methods.")

What is Bourgeois Nationalism?

	We know that bourgeois nationalism, as an expression of the bourgeois worldview, is irreconcilable and mutually hostile to proletarian internationalism. Proceeding from the profit-seeking nature of the bourgeoisie, what are their programs and policies on national issues? That is: domestically, they falsely claim to be the representatives of the nation or the protectors of national interests, while in reality, they make the interests of the entire people subordinate to the interests of the bourgeoisie or a certain class within the bourgeoisie (the big bourgeoisie), placing the interests of this class or a certain class within it above the interests of the entire nation and above the interests of all ethnic groups within the country; abroad, they pit the interests of their own nation (in essence, the bourgeoisie) against the interests of other nations, viewing their own nation as superior and, when possible, oppressing and exploiting other nations, implementing aggression. The highest form of development of this bourgeois nationalism is the rule of various imperialist countries over colonies and semi-colonies, imperialist wars of aggression, and the evil plan of the imperialist camp headed by US imperialism to enslave the world. Bourgeois nationalism can, under other conditions, transform into national surrenderism. When the nation is subjected to serious invasion and attack by foreign imperialism, or when the interests of the bourgeoisie, especially the big bourgeoisie, are in sharp contradiction with the fundamental interests of the people, or when the people rise up to threaten their rule, the bourgeoisie, especially the big bourgeoisie, can kneel and surrender to the rulers of foreign ethnic groups or other imperialists, betraying their own nation, helping the rulers of foreign ethnic groups or other imperialists to oppress their own people, in order to protect their own property and maintain their political status or rule. (Excerpt from the 16th issue of Study magazine, Qian Junrui: "From the Rightists' Anti-Soviet Crimes to Bourgeois Nationalism")

Local Nationalism is Anti-Socialist

	Regarding ethnic work, many people have put forward correct criticisms and opinions that are conducive to our implementation of the Party's ethnic policies. We welcome these correct criticisms and strive to correct them. However, there are also individuals who completely deny the achievements already made in ethnic work, or describe them as insignificant, while excessively exaggerating the shortcomings in ethnic work. They describe certain shortcomings and errors caused by violating the Party's ethnic policies in the work as the shortcomings and errors of the Party's ethnic policies themselves; some even say: "The Party's promotion of ethnic regional autonomy is a formality, merely writing Chinese characters below Uighur characters," disbelieving that the policy of regional autonomy can fully guarantee the de facto true equality of all ethnic groups. This view stems from local nationalism, which hinders our people of all ethnic groups from building a prosperous and happy socialist society, hinders the solid unity and mutual assistance and cooperation of all ethnic groups, and thus hinders the interests of the people of all ethnic groups.

专栏：报刊论文摘要

　　报刊论文摘要
　　我们提倡什么样的独立思考？
    要有正确的立场，才有正确的独立思考。右派分子叫嚣说：“有了立场就没有独立思考”。其实，右派分子的“独立思考”，只是在漂亮的口号下搬运资产阶级的、机会主义的、修正主义的理论残渣。事情很清楚：在现在的阶级社会里，不站在无产阶级立场上思考，就必然站在资产阶级立场或者地主阶级立场上思考。
    正确的立场是和正确的观点、正确的思想方法联系在一起的。马克思主义是我们无产阶级科学的宇宙观和思维方法，我们思考和认识问题是以马克思主义作指导思想的。右派分子攻击说：“马克思主义给思想加上了框框，妨碍了独立思想。”我们都知道，马克思主义是指导工人阶级进行革命斗争的理论武器，它的目的就在于解决工人革命斗争中的实际问题，它本身已经向人们提出独立思考的要求。如果马克思主义妨碍独立思考，列宁又怎么能够以马克思主义指导俄国革命，不仅取得了革命胜利，同时还发展了马克思主义呢？中国共产党和毛主席在马克思主义的指导下，在中国革命的一系列的根本问题上规定了适合于中国国情的路线方针，难道不也正是独立思考的典范吗？（摘自8月23日中国青年报社论：“要有正确的立场、观点和方法，才有正确的独立思考”）
　　什么是资产阶级的民族主义？
    我们知道资产阶级的民族主义，作为资产阶级的世界观的一种表现，是和无产阶级的国际主义不可调和的、互相敌对的。资产阶级从追求利润的天性出发，他们关于民族问题的纲领和政策是怎样的呢？那就是：在国内，他们僭称自己是本民族的代表，或者本民族利益的保护人，而实际上则使整个人民的利益服从于资产阶级或者资产阶级中的某一阶层（大资产阶级）的利益，把它这一阶级或其中的某一阶层的利益放在全国人民利益之上，放在国内各民族的利益之上；在国外，他们把自己民族（实质上是指资产阶级）和其他民族的利益对立起来，把自己民族看得高人一等，在可能的时候，就去压迫和剥削其他民族，实行侵略。这种资产阶级民族主义发展的最高形式，就是各帝国主义国家对于殖民地半殖民地的统治，就是帝国主义侵略战争，就是现在以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义阵营奴役世界的罪恶计划。资产阶级的民族主义在另外的条件下却又可能转变为民族投降主义。当本国民族受到外国帝国主义的严重侵略进攻的时候，或者在资产阶级、特别是大资产阶级的利益和本国人民根本利益发生尖锐矛盾的时候，或者本国人民起来威胁他们的统治的时候，资产阶级特别是大资产阶级，就可以向异民族的统治者或其他帝国主义者，屈膝投降，出卖自己的民族，帮助异民族的统治者或者其他帝国主义者来压迫本国的人民，来达到保护自己的财产，维持自己的政治地位或统治的目的。（摘自学习杂志第十六期钱俊瑞：“从右派反苏罪行说到资产阶级民族主义”）
    地方民族主义观点是反社会主义的
    关于民族工作，许多人都提出了有利于我们贯彻执行党的民族政策的正确的批评和意见。这种正确的批评，我们是欢迎的并努力予以改正。但是也有个别的人却完全抹煞了在民族工作方面已经取得的成就，或者把它说成微不足道，而对民族工作中的缺点却过分予以夸大。把在工作中违背党的民族政策所造成的某些缺点和错误，说成是党的民族政策本身的缺点和错误；有人竟然说：“党推行民族区域自治是形式，只不过是把汉文写在维文下边”，不相信区域自治政策能充分保障各民族事实上的真正平等。这种观点是出于地方民族主义的观点，它妨害着我们各民族人民建设繁荣、幸福的社会主义社会，妨害着各族人民的巩固团结和互助合作，也就是妨碍着各民族人民的利益。
  （摘自8月11日新疆日报伊敏诺夫：“坚决反击右派，毫不动摇地为社会主义而奋斗”）
