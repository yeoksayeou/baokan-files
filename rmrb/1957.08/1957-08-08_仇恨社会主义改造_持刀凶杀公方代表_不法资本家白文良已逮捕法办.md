    仇恨社会主义改造　持刀凶杀公方代表
    不法资本家白文良已逮捕法办
    据新华社福州6日电　据“福建日报”今天报道：厦门市公私合营双城文化用品商店私方人员白文良，因仇恨社会主义改造，在7月26日持刀凶杀公方代表陈如山。白犯已当场被群众扭送公安局派出所，并经市人民检察院批准予以逮捕，现正进行预审中。
    白犯在公私合营以前，为双城号主要股东和副经理；全行业合营以后，政府除给他定息外，还按照他的才能安排他为这家商店的营业员。但白犯仍迷恋过去不劳而获的生活，仇恨社会主义改造。白犯在26日晚上八时左右，利用他一个人在店中值班的机会，手持裁纸刀向刚回店休息的公方代表、副经理陈如山猛砍。陈如山颈部和手臂都受了重伤，白犯心仍不甘，将陈如山压在地上，用双手卡住陈的喉咙想把陈活活扼死。直到周围和过路居民闻声跑进来抢救后，陈如山才幸免于难。
    这一消息传出后，已激起了厦门市各阶层居民的愤怒，纷纷要求人民政府严办胆敢持刀行凶的不法资本家白文良。
