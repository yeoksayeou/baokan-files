　　Inner Mongolia's Literary and Artistic Construction

　　The First Mongolian Storytelling House
　　A large, yurt-style Mongolian storytelling house was recently completed in Hohhot, with a construction area of 300 square meters. This storytelling house was built to meet the demands of the Mongolian people. Soon, the autonomous region's famous storytellers and singers, Pa Jie and Mao Yihan, will perform here.

　　A New Type of Cinema
　　A cinema, the largest in the autonomous region, is under construction near the Inner Mongolia Museum in Hohhot. It is designed according to wide-screen cinema standards and can accommodate more than a thousand viewers. The entire project will be completed after National Day. After the cinema is completed, it will temporarily show ordinary films. Once wide-screen films are available, some necessary equipment will be installed so it can show wide-screen films.

　　Mongolian Folk Music Ensemble
　　The Inner Mongolia People's Broadcasting Station recently established the first Mongolian folk music ensemble. This ensemble is composed of Mongolian folk artists Sun Liang, Fuzhulong'a, and Daoerji. Some of them are good at playing the sihu and morin khuur, while others are good at storytelling and singing "Haolaibao" in Mongolian. In the future, the ensemble plans to absorb a number of famous singers and instrumentalists from the grasslands to make the cultural and entertainment life of the Mongolian people more active.

　　内蒙古的文艺建设
    第一座蒙古语说书馆
    一座大型蒙古包式的蒙古语说书馆，前几天在呼和浩特市建成，建筑面积有三百平方公尺。这座说书馆是适应蒙古族群众要求兴建的。不久，自治区著名的说唱诗人爬杰和毛依罕都将在这里说唱。
    新型的电影院
    在呼和浩特市内蒙古博物馆附近，正在兴建一座自治区最大的电影院。它是按照宽银幕影院标准设计的，可以容纳一千多观众。全部工程将在国庆节后完成。这座影院建成后，将暂时放映普通影片，等到有了宽银幕影片，再安设一些必要的装置，就可以放映宽银幕影片。
    蒙古族民间乐队
    内蒙古人民广播电台新近成立了第一个蒙古族民间乐队。这个乐队由蒙古族民间艺人孙良、富珠隆阿、道尔吉等组成。他们有的擅长拉四胡、奏马头琴，有的善于用蒙古语说书和演唱“好来宝”。这个乐队今后准备吸收一批草原上著名歌手和乐器手，使蒙古族人民的文化娱乐生活更加活跃。　（据新华社稿）
