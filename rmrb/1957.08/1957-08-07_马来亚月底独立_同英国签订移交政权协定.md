Xinhua News Agency, Kuala Lumpur—Britain and Malaya signed an agreement in Kuala Lumpur on the 5th regarding the transfer of power. The final constitutional procedure that must be completed in preparation for Malayan independence has thus been completed.

According to the agreement, after Malaya declares its independence, the Queen of England will cease to exercise sovereignty over the Federation. The "Federation Agreement" signed by Britain and Malaya in 1948, which stipulated the relationship between the two parties, is declared abolished.

The Federation of Malaya will declare its independence on the 31st of this month. Its first Supreme Head of State and Deputy Supreme Head of State have already been elected on August 3rd.

They were elected from among the Sultans of the states of the Federation of Malaya (two states are called Heads of State or Native Kings), with a term of five years. The currently elected Supreme Head of State is the Head of State of Negeri Sembilan: Abdul Rahman (he shares the same name as the current Chief Minister of the Federation), and the Deputy Supreme Head of State is the Sultan of Selangor: Hisamuddin Alam Shah.

    马来亚月底独立
    同英国签订移交政权协定
    据新华社讯　英国和马来亚5日在吉隆坡签订了移交政权的协定。为准备马来亚独立必须履行的最后一个宪法手续至此完成。
    根据这个协定，马来亚宣告独立以后，英国女王停止对联合邦行使主权。1948年英国和马来亚签订的规定双方关系的“联合邦协定”宣告废除。
    马来亚联合邦将在本月31日宣告独立。它的第一任正副最高元首已经在8月3日选出。
    他们是由马来亚联合邦各州的苏丹（有两个州称为元首或土王）中互选出来的，任期是五年。现在选出的最高元首是森美兰州的元首：阿卜杜勒·拉赫曼（他和现任联合邦首席部长同名），副最高元首是雪兰峨州的苏丹：希萨穆丁·阿拉姆·沙阿。
