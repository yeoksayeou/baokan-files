Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, August 23rd: At the sixth session of the first Shandong Provincial People's Congress currently being held in Jinan, the representatives severely criticized the anti-communist and anti-socialist words and deeds of the rightist Lu Kanru. Faced with a large amount of evidence and the representatives' powerful refutations, Lu Kanru was left speechless and expressed his surrender and confession to the people.

Lu Kanru is the Vice President of Shandong University and the Chairman of the Qingdao Branch of the Jiusan Society. He confessed at the meeting that his attack on the Communist Party was organized, had a program, a plan, and steps. He had thorough considerations and plans from the beginning of the attack to the temporary retreat.

Lu Kanru confessed that when he attended the Second Plenary Session of the Jiusan Society in Beijing in March this year, a rightist group was formed around Chu Anping and Gao Juefu among the central committee members of the Jiusan Society. Lu Kanru participated in several meetings of this group, secretly plotting counter-revolutionary schemes, attempting to use the organization of the Jiusan Society to usurp the Communist Party's leadership in the fields of culture, education, and science. In order to achieve this counter-revolutionary goal, they even wanted to create a "big democracy" like the Hungarian incident in schools to overthrow the Communist Party's leadership in schools. Before leaving, Gao Juefu repeatedly instructed Lu Kanru to "keep it secret." After Gao Juefu returned to Nanjing, he also wrote a letter urging Lu to "never talk about it with anyone." After Lu Kanru returned to Qingdao, he secretly carried out his conspiracy.

In order to carry out the conspiracy of this counter-revolutionary group, Lu Kanru first expanded the members of the anti-Party clique in Qingdao. After the start of the Great Blooming and Letting Contend, Lu believed that the time was ripe, so he established four guidelines for his words and deeds: First, take the opportunity of helping the Communist Party rectify its work style to attack the Party; second, use the excuse of discussing the system of Party committees in universities to overthrow the Communist Party's leadership in schools; third, establish core groups within the Jiusan Society branches to ignite the fire in various units; fourth, widely promote anti-Communist fallacies. Lu said that at this time, his ambition was not only to become a tyrant in Shandong University and the cultural, educational, and scientific circles of Qingdao but also to become a tyrant in the cultural, educational, and scientific circles of Shandong Province. He also wantonly recruited members in Qingdao and major cities in Shandong Province, actively preparing to establish a provincial-level organization, attempting to control the provincial affairs through his identity as a central committee member of the Jiusan Society, and to control the cultural, educational, and scientific circles of the entire province through the provincial-level organization; and finally, to lead Shandong University and Qingdao, and even Shandong Province's cultural, educational, and scientific undertakings, onto the capitalist road.

In order to realize this political conspiracy, Lu Kanru used Zhang Bojun's distorted transmission of the system of Party committees in universities to spread rumors everywhere. In order to deceive more people into believing him, he deliberately said that the system of Party committees and the Party's leadership were two different things, and he falsely accused the system of Party committees as being mutually causal with the "three evils." Lu Kanru not only spread rumors in Qingdao about the Party committee system but also sent this distorted transmission draft to the Jinan branch of the Jiusan Society, setting fire to Jinan.

Under the guidance of Lu Kanru's counter-revolutionary program, his accomplices made the most trouble at Shandong University. They expanded a big-character poster of a Jiusan Society group into a mimeographed newspaper of the entire branch, attacking the Party committee system, attacking the Three-Anti and Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries movements, supporting students in making trouble in the newspaper office, and promoting capitalist legal systems. On June 2, under the instruction of Lu Kanru, the "Jiusan" organizations of Shandong University and Qingdao Medical College jointly held a symposium to attack the Communist Party. On the surface, it was a discussion of so-called "democratic school management," but in reality, it was a swearing-in meeting full of evil winds and aimed at attacking the Communist Party and activists.

Lu Kanru said that after the People's Daily successively published several editorials against the rightists, in order to cover up himself, he temporarily retreated by pretending to oppose the rightists. The retreat at that time was not surrender, but to preserve strength and wait for opportunities to attack again. Lu Kanru thought that the anti-rightist movement would only be a passing fad and did not expect that the power of the people's struggle would become stronger and stronger, and the determination to never withdraw until a complete victory was achieved would become more and more firm. Under this situation, his evil fantasies were shattered one by one.

Lu Kanru said that now his mind is a little clearer. Looking back on his past crimes, they are indeed extremely serious. He felt that after liberation, he had actually repaid kindness with enmity towards the Communist Party. He finally expressed that he would make amends for his crimes with practical actions to correct his mistakes in the future.

　　储安平、高觉敷反动集团的阴谋在山东破产
　　陆侃如缴械投降低头认罪
    新华社济南23日电　正在济南举行的山东省第一届人民代表大会第六次会议上，代表们对右派分子陆侃如的反共反社会主义言行进行了严正的批判。在大量事实面前和代表们的有力驳斥下，陆侃如理屈词穷，表示向人民低头认罪。
    陆侃如是山东大学副校长，九三学社青岛分社主任委员。他在大会上交代说：他对共产党进攻是有组织、有纲领、有计划、有步骤的，从开始进攻到暂时退却，都有周密的考虑和打算。
    陆侃如交代他今年3月到北京出席九三学社二中全会时，在九三的中央委员中以储安平、高觉敷为中心形成了一个右派集团，陆侃如参加了这个集团的多次会议，密谋反动大计，企图利用九三学社的组织，来篡夺共产党在文教科学方面的领导权。为了实现这个反动目的，他们竟想在学校里搞匈牙利事件一样的大民主，来推翻共产党在学校里的领导。临别时，高觉敷一再嘱咐陆侃如要“保密”，高觉敷回南京后，还写信叮嘱陆“切勿与任何人谈及”。陆侃如回青岛后，便暗中进行阴谋活动。
    陆侃如为了执行这个反动集团的阴谋，首先在青岛扩大反党小集团的成员。大鸣大放开始后，陆认为时机成熟，便为自己的言行立下了四条纲领：一、利用帮助共产党整风的机会，向党进攻；二、借口讨论高等学校党委制，推翻共产党在学校里的领导；三、在九三分社及支社内成立核心小组，到各单位点火；四、广泛宣传反对共产党的谬论。陆说：这时他的野心不仅想成为山东大学以及青岛文教科学界的一霸，还想成为山东省文教科学界的一霸。他还在青岛以及山东省各大城市乱拉社员，积极筹备成立省级组织，企图以“九三”中央委员的身份来控制全省社务，通过省级组织来控制全省的文教科学界；最后把山东大学以及青岛市乃至山东省的文教科学事业，都带到资本主义的道路上去。
    陆侃如为了实现这个政治阴谋，利用章伯钧关于高等学校党委制的歪曲传达，到处造谣。为了骗取更多人的相信，他还故意说党委制和党的领导是两回事；诬蔑党委制与三害互为因果。陆侃如不仅以党委制问题在青岛造谣惑众，并且把这个歪曲的传达稿寄给九三学社济南分社，把火点到济南来。
    在陆侃如反动纲领的指导下，他的党羽在山东大学闹得最凶。他们把“九三”一个小组的大字报扩大成为整个支社的油印报，攻击党委制，攻击三反、肃反运动，支持学生闹报社，宣扬资本主义法制。6月2日，在陆侃如的指使下，山东大学和青岛医学院的“九三”组织联合举行了一个向共产党进攻的座谈会，表面上是讨论所谓
  “民主办校”，实际上是一个充满歪风邪气，向共产党、向积极分子开火的誓师大会。
    陆侃如说：在人民日报连续发表了几篇反右派的社论以后，为了掩护自己，他就用伪装反右派的方式，暂时退却。当时的退却并不是投降，只是为了保持实力，等待机会，再来进攻。陆侃如以为反右派的运动只是一阵风就过去了，没有料到人民斗争的力量越来越壮大，不获全胜决不收兵的决心越来越坚定。在这个形势下他的罪恶幻想才一一破灭。
    陆侃如说，现在他的头脑清醒了一点，回想过去的罪恶，的确严重万分，感到解放后对共产党竟然是恩将仇报。他最后表示今后要以改过的实际行动来替自己赎罪。
