Attacking the China Peking Opera Company
Zhang Bojun and Li Boqiu Had Long Planned It

(Our Newspaper) The China Peking Opera Company recently held a series of meetings of all its staff. Xing Wenxin, a cadre of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Justice, who acted as the vanguard for rightists such as Zhang Bojun, Li Boqiu, and Li Jiansheng in setting fires in Beijing's opera circles, confessed at the meeting some of the facts of his participation in the attack on the China Peking Opera Company.

Xing Wenxin said that Zhang Bojun, Li Boqiu, and Li Jiansheng had been planning the attack on the opera circles for a long time. They initially sent Xing to connect with Ye Shengchang, an actor in the Peking Opera Company, to find out which actors in the Peking Opera Company were dissatisfied with the Party and the leadership. After Ye Shengchang agreed to join the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, Li Boqiu expressed great satisfaction, saying, "A breakthrough has been made in the Peking Opera Company." He then specifically arranged the first step to hold a forum, contact the masses, and expand the influence of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party; the second step was to vigorously develop the organization, and the third step was to establish a branch in the Peking Opera Company, attempting to gradually usurp the Party's leadership in the Peking Opera Company.

Xing Wenxin admitted that under the direct command of Li Boqiu and others, he had actively engaged in activities in the opera circles, instigated actors from the Peking Opera Company to attend forums to "pour out their grievances," and discussed the list of people to develop the organization in the Peking Opera Company with Ye Shengchang. At the same time, he used divisive tactics to make actors hate the Party and used promises of official positions and other methods to lure actors to join the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party.

Xing Wenxin's reactionary words and deeds were appreciated by Li Boqiu, who planned to appoint Xing as the organization member of the Beijing Municipal Committee Opera Branch of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party and provide him with special financial subsidies.

    向中国京剧院进攻
    章伯钧李伯球蓄谋已久
    本报讯　中国京剧院近日连续召开全体工作人员大会，充当章伯钧、李伯球、李健生等右派分子在北京戏曲界放火的急先锋、北京市司法局干部邢文鑫在会上交代了他参与向中国京剧院进攻的一些事实。
    邢文鑫说，章伯钧、李伯球、李健生对戏曲界的进攻策划已久，他们最初派邢和京剧院的演员叶盛长挂上钩，了解京剧院演员哪些人对党、对领导不满。在叶盛长答应参加农工民主党后，李伯球表示非常满意，说：“京剧院缺口已打开了。”接着具体布置了第一步要召开座谈会，联系群众，扩大农工民主党影响；第二步大力发展组织，第三步在京剧院成立支部，企图逐渐篡夺党在京剧院的领导权。
    邢文鑫承认他在李伯球等的直接指挥下，曾在京剧界积极活动，并煽动京剧院演员出席座谈会去“诉苦”，和叶盛长研究了在京剧院发展组织的名单。同时用挑拨的手段，使演员对党仇恨，以封官许爵等办法来利诱演员参加农工民主党。
    邢文鑫的反动言行，得到李伯球的赏识，并准备让邢担任农工民主党北京市委戏曲支部的组织委员，在经济上给予特别费补助。
