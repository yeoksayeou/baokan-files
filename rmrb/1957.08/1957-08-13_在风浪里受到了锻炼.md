Tempered in the Storms
Zhu Xinghua, student of Tsinghua University

An extraordinary summer follows an extraordinary spring. Three months of breathtaking events have passed in the heat of struggle. These are days that one will never forget in a lifetime. In the wind and the waves, I have been tempered, and my steps are firmer. I often like to recall those days of struggle. Indeed, for a university student of the Mao Zedong era, a member of the Communist Youth League, these are valuable lessons that are forever worth remembering!

This class struggle provoked by the right-wingers seems to have been a miscalculation on their part. They have suffered a bloody nose, but for us, it has been the most vivid lesson in class struggle, a live political examination. Every university student has, without exception, taken this exam. Some scored five points, while others only scored two.

Recalling the initial stage of the rectification campaign, the right-wingers took advantage of the Party's rectification to launch a wild attack on the Party. In Tsinghua University, the arrogance of this small group of right-wingers was also extremely blatant. They used the weakness of some students' ambiguous positions and understanding to try their best to uglify and attack the Party, demanding that the Party withdraw from the school. They also maliciously attacked all upright people who supported the Party and supported socialism, scolding us as the "Goethe-Dante" faction, the "defenders of the faith," attempting to seal the mouths of active elements and isolate the Party. Faced with this situation, as a member of the Communist Youth League, I felt it was unbearable. My heart was filled with the anger and heaviness one feels when one's beloved mother is attacked. What weighed heavily on me was that many comrades had not yet clearly judged the serious class struggle nature of the situation at that time, so our strength had not yet been gathered together to fight. Just then, the People's Daily editorial "Why is this?" was published. I heard the broadcast of this editorial while eating breakfast and was so excited that I threw down my rice bowl and hugged the comrade next to me. We couldn't help but shout: Long live the People's Daily! Long live our most brilliant Party! It was the Party that pointed out the direction for us in this most difficult and heavy time, gave us the strength to fight, instantly made our vision so clear and far-reaching, and transformed the anger and heaviness in our chests into the determination and courage to engage in a life-and-death struggle with the class enemy to defend the Party. Indeed, in my life, I had never felt that an article could generate such great power in me, or make my emotions so excited. I will never forget that mood, like a child far from home, who, after being tormented and watching his mother being attacked, returns to his mother's arms, draws strength and confidence, and feels the joy of fighting alongside his mother. This time, I most deeply realized that just as a child cannot live without its mother, a communist fighter cannot live without the Party. I swore to myself: in this life, I will follow the Party at all times and fight for the Party for the rest of my life. In this struggle, we do have many comrades who have steadfastly stood on the Party's position from beginning to end, without wavering, demonstrating a clear attitude. Like Comrade Luo Jianmin, a member of the Communist Youth League in our school, when the right-wingers were putting on a smokescreen and launching a wild attack, he stepped forward and was the first to post a big-character poster calling on Communist Party members to rise up and fight. He deserves to be our role model. Among our brand-new generation of university students, such warriors are not a minority. In more than a month of the anti-rightist struggle, how many tireless warriors emerged in our school! During the day, braving the scorching heat, they went everywhere to verify materials, some burying themselves in the library all day preparing to thoroughly shatter the right-wing fallacies with powerful arguments; late at night, lights still shone from many rooms, people were still analyzing the situation and preparing for tomorrow's battle, or writing big-character posters. Early in the morning, when people saw the still-wet ink on the big-character posters on the walls, they had just entered their sleep. It was these people who united the majority of students to launch a thunderous counterattack against the right-wingers. They prominently represented the clear political attitude of the new Chinese university students—to always stand with the workers and peasants, and to always loyally follow the Communist Party.

In the struggle, some students did not do so well, could not stand firm in the wind and waves, and swayed from side to side, without a firm position and keen political sense. Although most of these students have now awakened and joined the anti-rightist struggle, this is, after all, a beneficial lesson for us. We must vigorously strengthen ideological and political education among young students, we must constantly wage irreconcilable struggle against bourgeois ideology, and we must constantly and consciously transform our thinking in order to become builders who meet the needs of socialism. This storm also pointed out that flowers cultivated in greenhouses cannot withstand wind and rain, and university students should be put into practical life to be tempered.

Yes, steel must be made in the fire, and strong warriors grow up in the wind and waves. I, as a member of the Communist Youth League, have experienced this test and will forever cherish the tempering and education that the great wind and waves of these past few months have given me. The reality of class struggle has taught me how to distinguish the enemy, how to hate the enemy, and how to fight them; it has also told me what kind of warriors the communist cause needs. I regret that I was not able to become a Communist Party member earlier, but after this test, I have made up my mind to strive to join the Party as soon as possible, to fight by the side of the Party for the rest of my life, and to firmly defend the Party and defend the socialist road.

Of course, for us, the test is not over, and the anti-rightist struggle is still deepening. In addition to this, it can be imagined that there are more difficulties and tests lying on our road forward, and we must meet them head-on with a firm position, overcoming all obstacles. Not to mention the distant future, but at present, our graduating class faces the issue of obeying the needs of the motherland. I believe that university students who have passed this exam will certainly live up to the expectations of the Party and the people. We are determined to take the socialist road for life, determined to combine with the workers and peasants, and to make ourselves a new type of socialist intellectual.

New type university students will forever belong to the Party, belong to socialism! Any right-wing element attempting to compete with the Party for university students is merely daydreaming.

### 在风浪里受到了锻炼

    在风浪里受到了锻炼
    清华大学学生　朱幸华
    一个不平常的夏天接着一个不平常的春天，惊心动魄的三个月在火热的斗争里过去了，这是一生永远也不能忘记的日子，风里浪里，锻炼了自己，脚步更坚定了。我时常喜欢去回想那些斗争的日子，的确，这对于一个毛泽东时代的大学生、一个共青团员来说，是永远值得自己去回忆的，这里面有着多少年青人难得的可贵的教训啊！
    这场右派分子所挑起的阶级斗争，看来他们是失算了，碰得头破血流了，但这对我们来说却是上了阶级斗争最生动的一课，是一场活的政治考试，每一个大学生都无例外地接受了这场考试，有的得了五分，有的却得了二分。
    回想整风初期，右派分子利用党整风的机会，向党发动了猖狂的进攻。在清华园里，这一小撮右派分子的气焰也是极为嚣张的，他们利用一些同学立场上和认识上模糊的弱点，竭力丑化党，攻击党，要党退出学校。他们还恶毒地打击一切拥护党拥护社会主义的正直的人们，骂我们为“歌德—但丁”派，是“卫道者”，企图封住积极分子的嘴，使党陷于孤立。在这种情况面前，作为一个共青团员，我感到难以忍受，心里充满了那种当亲爱的母亲遭受攻击时的愤怒和沉重，沉重的是很多同志还没能清楚地判断当时情况的严重阶级斗争性质，因而我们的力量还没有能集结起来战斗。正在这时，人民日报社论“这是为什么？”发表了，我在吃早饭的时候听到了这篇社论的广播，激动得扔下了饭碗，和旁边的同志拥抱起来了，我们情不自禁地要高呼：人民日报万岁！我们最英明的党万岁。是党，在这最艰难沉重的时候，给我们指出了方向，给了我们斗争的力量，一瞬时使我们的眼光变得那么明澈远大，使我们胸中的愤怒和沉重化成了和阶级敌人作生死斗争来捍卫党的决心和勇气。的确，我有生以来，从来还没有体会到过一篇文章会在自己身上产生这样巨大的力量，会使自己的感情激动到这样。我永远也不会忘记那时的心情，就像一个远离膝下的孩子，在备受折磨和眼看母亲受人攻击的时候，重又回到母亲的怀里，汲取了力量与信心和母亲一起战斗时的那种喜悦的心情。我这次最深刻地体会到：就像孩子离不了母亲，共产主义战士离不了党；我向自己发誓：这一生，将要任何时候跟着党走，终生地为党战斗。在这次斗争里，我们确实有很多同志自始至终坚定地站在党的立场上，毫不动摇，表现了鲜明的态度。像我校共青团员罗健敏同志，在右派分子大摆迷魂阵猖狂进攻的时候，挺身而出，首先贴出了号召共产党员起来战斗的大字报，他不愧为我们学习的榜样。在我们崭新一代的大学生里面，这样的战士并非少数，在一个多月的反右派斗争中，我们学校里涌现了多少个不知疲倦的战士啊，白天，冒着酷暑，到处对证材料，有的整天埋头在图书馆里准备着以有力的论据，来彻底粉碎右派谬论；夜深了，很多房间里还透出盏盏灯火，人们还在那里分析情况准备明天的战斗，或者在编写大字报。清晨，当人们在墙上看到墨迹未干的大字报时，他们才刚刚进入睡乡。——就是这样的一些人们，团结了广大同学对右派展开了雷霆万钧的反击。他们突出地代表了新中国大学生的鲜明的政治态度——永远和工人农民站在一起，永远忠诚地跟着共产党走。
    在斗争中也有一些同学考得不太好，在风浪里站不稳脚跟，表现得左摇右摆，没有坚定的立场和敏锐的政治嗅觉，虽然今天这些同学大部都已清醒过来了，投入了反右派斗争。但这些对于我们毕竟是一个有益的教训，必须在青年学生中大力加强思想政治教育，必须对资产阶级思想经常进行不调和的斗争，必须不断自觉地改造思想，才能成为符合社会主义需要的建设者。这次风浪也指出了：暖房里培养出来的花朵是经不住风吹雨打的，大学生应该放到实际生活里去磨炼。
    是的，钢铁要在烈火中炼成，坚强的战士是在风浪里成长。我，作为一个共青团员，经历了这场考验，也将永远地珍贵这几个月来的大风巨浪所给我的锻炼和教育。阶级斗争的现实教会了我怎样去分辨敌人，怎样去憎恨敌人，去和他们战斗；也告诉了我共产主义事业需要着怎样的战士，我遗憾自己没有能更早地成为一个共产党员，但是经过了这次考验，我下定了决心，争取早日入党，要终生战斗在党的身旁，坚定地捍卫党，捍卫社会主义的道路。
    当然，对于我们来说，考验还没有结束，反右派的斗争还正在深入。除此而外，可以设想，还有更多的困难和考验摆在我们前进的路上，必须以坚定的立场过关斩将迎接上去。远的不说，目前对我们毕业班同学来说就面临着服从祖国需要的问题，我相信经过了这场考试后的大学生，一定会不辜负党和人民的期待，我们下定决心终身走社会主义的道路，下定决心和工农结合，使自己成为新型的社会主义劳动知识分子。
    新型大学生永远属于党，属于社会主义！任何右派分子企图来和党争夺大学生，这只是妄想。
