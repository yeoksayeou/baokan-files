What is an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile?
　　Soviet Komsomolskaya Pravda Publishes Science Essay
    The Soviet Union was the first to successfully test an intercontinental ballistic missile before the capitalist countries, but it still insists on banning the testing and use of atomic and hydrogen weapons. This is applauded by peace-loving people and shocks imperialist elements. What is an intercontinental ballistic missile? Komsomolskaya Pravda published a science essay by Petrov on the 29th. The author said: An intercontinental ballistic missile is a rocket with two or three stages stacked together. This rocket is launched vertically, passes through the atmosphere, smoothly turns, and flies along a ballistic curve at an altitude of one thousand kilometers. As the name suggests, the characteristic of an intercontinental ballistic missile is that it can reach eight thousand kilometers or even further, is controlled throughout its entire ballistic trajectory, and reaches a speed of 16,000 kilometers per hour. There are now ways to defend against supersonic bombers, but there is currently no way to deal with intercontinental ballistic missiles that fly so high and so fast. When manufacturing intercontinental ballistic missiles, designers encountered various difficulties: the missile would self-ignite due to frictional heat when passing through the atmosphere at such a high speed; the control equipment had to be very precise, for example, when the missile was flying at a speed of seven kilometers per second, the deviation could not exceed ten centimeters in one second, etc. Many capitalist countries are studying the problem of manufacturing intercontinental ballistic missiles. The United States established a special committee in 1953 to try to manufacture intercontinental ballistic missiles. Now, capitalist newspapers admit that the Soviet Union is the first country in the world to produce an intercontinental ballistic missile.

### 什么是洲际导弹？　苏联共青真理报发表科学小品

　　什么是洲际导弹？
　　苏联共青真理报发表科学小品
    苏联比资本主义国家先试验成功了洲际导弹，但它仍坚持禁止试验和使用原子和氢武器的主张。这使爱好和平的人士喝采，而使帝国主义分子震惊。什么是洲际导弹呢？共青团真理报29日发表了彼特罗夫写的科学小品。作者说：洲际导弹，这是两三层火箭套在一起的火箭。这种火箭垂直射出，穿越气层，顺利地转弯，沿着弹道曲线在一千公里高空飞行。顾名思义，洲际导弹的特色是它能射到八千公里甚至更远，在全部弹道行程中都受操纵，速度达到一小时一万六千公里。现在有办法防范超音速轰炸机，但是目前还没有办法对付飞得那么高那么快的洲际导弹。在制造洲际导弹时，设计家曾遭到种种困难：导弹以那么高速度穿越气层会因摩擦发热而自焚；操纵的设备要非常精确，例如在导弹以一秒七公里的速度飞行时，在一秒中偏差不能超过十公分等等。许多资本主义国家都在研究制造洲际导弹问题，美国在1953年就组织了专门委员会想制造洲际导弹。现在资本主义国家报刊承认，苏联是世界上第一个制成了洲际导弹的国家。
