Xinhua News Agency, August 10th: Staff members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Archaeology have held a series of symposiums in recent days to expose and criticize Chen Mengjia's anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds.

The meeting revealed that this "scholar," who claimed to have always "ignored politics," had suddenly developed a strong interest in political and social activities since this spring. During the period of the Great Blooming and Contending, Chen Mengjia, under various guises such as archaeologist, historian, epigrapher, philologist, poet, essayist, and drama critic, actively participated in rectification symposiums in more than a dozen units, publishing a series of anti-Party and anti-socialist fallacies, and stirring up trouble everywhere. This "philologist," who had never expressed opposition to the Kuomintang's "simplified Chinese characters," actually demanded that the State Council abolish the already promulgated draft of the Chinese character simplification plan. He actually became a vanguard of the Zhang-Luo alliance's attack on the Party in the area of language reform. Chen Mengjia also denied the leading role of the Party, saying, "The Academy of Sciences is for doing science, and the Party is here to help." He also said, "The leaders at all levels of the Academy of Sciences are all officials, big and small. Let them all go to places where they can be officials, and they should not be in scientific research institutions."

At the meeting on the 9th, Chen Mengjia, in his preliminary "self-criticism," admitted that he "had similarities with right-wing elements" and "made a big mistake." He also said that the reason he made these mistakes was due to "ignoring politics, focusing on professional work, and having individualistic thoughts," and so on. Everyone immediately pointed out that Chen Mengjia was not "similar to right-wing elements"; he was actually a right-wing element. Chen Mengjia is not a good epigrapher or philologist... he is a personal ambitionist.

    考古研究所批判揭露陈梦家
    这个自称忽视政治的学者实际是个人野心家
    新华社10日讯　中国科学院考古研究所工作人员连日举行座谈会揭露和批判陈梦家的反党反社会主义言行。
    会上揭露，这个自称一贯“忽视政治”的“学者”自从今年春季以来，忽然对政治和社会活动发生了浓厚的兴趣。在大鸣大放时期，陈梦家分别以考古学家、史学家、金石学家、文字学家、诗人、散文家、戏剧评论家等多种身分，积极地参加了十几个单位的整风座谈会，发表了一系列的反党反社会主义谬论，到处点火。这位对国民党的“简化汉字”从未表示过反对态度的“文字学者”，居然要求国务院将已经公布的汉字简化方案草案作废。他实际上成为章罗联盟在文字改革方面向党进攻的一个急先锋。陈梦家还否认党的领导作用，说“科学院是办科学的，党是来帮助的”。他还说，“科学院各级领导人都是大大小小的官，让他们都到作官的地方去吧，他们别在科学研究机关”。
    在9日的会上，陈梦家在初步“检讨”中，承认他“同右派分子有相似的地方”、“犯了很大的错误”。他还说他所以犯这些错误，是由于“忽视政治，偏重业务，有个人主义思想”等等。大家当即指出，陈梦家不是“同右派分子相似”，他实际上就是右派分子。陈梦家不是什么好的金石学家、文字学家……，他是一个个人野心家。
