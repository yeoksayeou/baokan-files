Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, August 30th. People from all walks of life in Chongqing are enthusiastically helping unemployed people find a way to make a living. Of the 17,599 unemployed people placed in the city in the first quarter of this year, less than four-thousandths were placed by the state, and the rest found jobs with the enthusiastic help of people from all walks of life.

Due to the development of the increased production and economy drive this year, factories, mines, enterprises and government bodies have generally stopped adding new organizations or increasing personnel, and opportunities for labor employment introduced by the government have decreased. District street offices and mass organizations have actively mobilized people from all walks of life to help unemployed people solve the problem of making a living. The open-air tea house operated by four unemployed people near the Niujiaotuo bus station in the Central District was opened with the help of local people. Seven residents lent them 95 yuan as capital, and another 11 residents lent them seven tables and 30 chairs. The Chongqing Public Transport Company also supported them with awnings and electric lights. Several joint state-private stores nearby lent the unemployed people surplus glass cabinets, pots, and kettles. Many residents also helped them build stoves, level the ground, and repair tables and chairs free of charge. Since it opened at the end of April this year, this tea house has tried its best to provide convenience to customers and has been universally welcomed by passing travelers and bus drivers. Since the tea house opened at the end of April this year, it now has a surplus in addition to paying monthly wages and repaying loans.

A handicraft production cooperative formed by unemployed people in Shapingba District was also established with the help of local people. The district's Democratic Women's Federation and units such as the Hua Yi Paper Mill lent them money as capital, and nearby textile factories sold them waste yarn and cloth at a low price as raw materials for making broom handles. At present, the cooperative has accumulated about 9,000 yuan in funds and has begun to provide appropriate medical subsidies to its members. In addition to the 52 unemployed people participating in production, the cooperative has now also absorbed two demobilized soldiers and 12 disabled, old and weak poor people.

When organizing production, many unemployed people in Chongqing have also received technical assistance from some social organizations and individuals. A middle school teacher in Chaoyang Town, Beibei District, helped four unemployed households design a tiger stove, which saved coal, so the selling price of boiled water was about two-thirds cheaper than that of ordinary teahouses. These four unemployed households now have a monthly salary of about 30 yuan, and the problem of living expenses has been completely solved. Nearby residents are also very satisfied. Assistant teachers and students from the Department of Electrical Engineering and the Department of Mechanical Engineering of Chongqing University used their evening or Sunday rest time to help the wood flour production cooperative organized by some unemployed families of revolutionary martyrs in Shapingba District design and install electric stone mills. The university's training iron factory also only charged them the cost of producing machinery and equipment. Now, this cooperative has developed from manual labor to mainly using power for production.

According to statistics from the Chongqing Municipal Labor Department, more than 260,000 people in Chongqing have found employment in the past seven years. At present, there are only more than 3,500 unemployed people in the city, which has basically solved the problem of unemployment left over from the old society.

    依靠社会人士解决社会失业问题
    重庆市七年来已有二十六万多人获得劳动就业
    新华社重庆30日电　重庆市各方面社会人士热心帮助失业人员谋求生活出路。全市在今年第一季度安置的一万七千五百九十九个失业人员中，由国家介绍就业的不到千分之四，其余都是在各方面社会人士热心帮助下找到工作的。
    由于今年开展增产节约运动，各厂矿企业和机关一般都停止增设机构和增加人员，由政府介绍劳动就业的机会减少了，各区街道办事处和群众团体就积极发动社会人士帮助失业人员解决生活出路问题。由四个失业人员在市中区牛角沱汽车站附近经营的露天茶馆，就是在当地群众帮助下开设起来的。有七个居民借出九十五元给他们作资本，另有十一户居民借出七张桌子和三十把椅子给他们。重庆公共交通公司也支援他们凉篷和电灯。附近几家公私合营商店把多余的玻璃柜、锅、壶借给这些失业人员，不少居民还义务帮助他们打灶、平地、修桌椅。这个茶馆开张后，尽量给顾客方便，受到过往旅客和汽车司机的普遍欢迎。这个茶馆自今年4月底开办以来，现在除每月发工资和还了借款外，还有了节余。
    沙坪坝区由失业人员组成的一个手工业生产合作社，也是在当地群众的帮助下办起来的。这个区的民主妇女联合会和华一造纸厂等单位借钱给他们做资本，附近的纺织工厂把废纱、废布廉价卖给他们做扎帚把的原料。目前这个社已积累了九千元左右的资金，并开始对社员实行适当的医药补助。这个社除有五十二个失业人员参加生产外，现在还吸收了两个复员军人和十二个残废、老弱的贫民。
    重庆市许多失业人员在组织生产时，还得到一些社会团体和个人的技术帮助。北碚区朝阳镇的一个中学教师，帮助四户失业人员设计了一个老虎灶，因为省煤，所烧开水的售价比一般茶馆便宜约三分之二。这四户失业人员现在每月工资在三十元左右，生活费用问题全部解决了。附近的居民也非常满意。重庆大学电机系和机械系的助教和学生，利用晚上或星期日的休息时间，帮助沙坪坝区由一些失业的烈军属组织的木粉生产合作社设计和安装电推石磨，这个大学的实习铁工厂也只按成本替他们生产机器设备。现在，这个社已由原来的人工劳动发展到主要用动力生产了。
    据重庆市劳动部门统计，重庆市在过去七年内已有二十六万多人获得劳动就业。目前全市仅有失业人员三千五百多人，基本上解决了旧社会遗留下来的失业问题。
