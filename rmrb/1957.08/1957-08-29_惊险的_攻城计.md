　　Thrilling "Siege Warfare"
　　When two armies face each other, both sides set up defenses. If one side wants to conquer the other, there must be a most intense battle. The Yugoslav film "Siege Warfare" unfolds its plot at the peak of such a conflict.
　　In 1806, the Serbians formed a revolutionary army and besieged the Turkish invaders in Belgrade for six months, reaching a stalemate. If the Serbians wanted to enter the city, they had to find a breach in the city walls. They sent people into the city batch after batch, but one after another disappeared. At this critical juncture, a legendary hero appeared: a Serbian revolutionary soldier captured the daughter of the Turkish minister trapped in the city, fell in love with her, and, led by her, entered the city, experienced countless dangers, and finally found the secret passage for attacking the city.
　　This film has a rigorous structure, and the development of the plot is mysterious and peculiar, able to tightly grab the audience. More valuable is that the film portrays lively and vigorous heroic figures in a thrilling style. The hearts of these heroic figures are filled with love for their motherland and nation, and they all possess unwavering integrity.

　  惊险的“攻城计”
    两军对垒，彼此设防，一方要攻克另一方，必有一场最剧烈的激战。南斯拉夫的影片“攻城计”，就是在这样一个冲突的尖顶上展开它的剧情的。
    1806年，塞尔维亚人组成了革命的军队，把土耳其侵略者围困在贝尔格莱德达六个月之久，相持不下。塞尔维亚人要攻进城去，就必须找到城墙的缺口。他们一批一批的派人进城去，但一个一个都不见下落。就在这紧急关头，传奇式的英雄人物出现了：一个塞尔维亚革命军的战士，俘获了困守城中的土耳其大臣的女儿，和她发生了爱情，在她的带领下进了城，经历了无数艰险，终于找到了攻城的秘密通道。
    这张影片有着严谨的布局，剧情的发展也是奥妙而且奇特的，能够紧紧地抓住观众。更可贵的是，影片以惊险的样式刻划出了生龙活虎般的英雄人物。这些英雄人物的内心，都激荡着对祖国和民族的爱，都具有忠贞不屈的气节。
