Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 6th: Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Bulganin sent a reply on August 2nd to Lewis Hoskins, Chairman of the American Friends Service Committee, welcoming his appeal in the letter for the prohibition of nuclear weapons.

In his letter to Bulganin, Hoskins stated: "We are deeply concerned about the continued testing of nuclear weapons by any country. We believe that this issue can be addressed separately from other issues such as disarmament, and that resolving the issue of prohibiting nuclear weapon tests will more effectively promote the resolution of the issue of general disarmament."

In his reply, Bulganin wrote: "The Soviet government has stated more than once that it is prepared to cease testing atomic and hydrogen weapons if other countries manufacturing such weapons—the United States and Great Britain—also cease such testing simultaneously. However, the Soviet government's proposals on this issue have not yet received the due support from other participants in the disarmament talks.

In order to resolve the issue of ceasing nuclear weapon tests as quickly as possible, the Soviet government recently proposed a temporary suspension of such weapon tests for two or three years, and the establishment of corresponding monitoring stations within the Soviet Union, the United States, and Great Britain, and in the Pacific region, to observe the implementation of this obligation by the countries undertaking it.

The Soviet Union understands your concern about the continued testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons and welcomes your appeal for the cessation of testing such weapons."

### 苏联一贯主张禁止核武器试验  布尔加宁欢迎美国公谊服务会的呼吁

    苏联一贯主张禁止核武器试验
    布尔加宁欢迎美国公谊服务会的呼吁
    据新华社莫斯科6日电　苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁8月2日给美国公谊服务会理事会主席凯德伯里一封回信，对他在来信中要求禁止核武器的呼吁表示欢迎。
    凯德伯里在给布尔加宁的信中说，我们对任何国家继续试验核武器都感到极为不安。我们认为，这个问题可以同裁军等其他问题分开来单独加以解决，而禁止核武器试验问题的解决也会更有效地促进普遍裁军问题的解决。
    布尔加宁在回信中写道，苏联政府不止一次地表示，它准备停止原子武器和氢武器的试验，如果制造这种武器的其他国家——美国和英国也同时停止这种试验的话。但是，苏联政府对这个问题的建议，现在还没有得到其他裁军谈判参加国的应有的支持。
    为了尽速解决停止试验核武器的问题，苏联政府不久以前曾经建议暂时停止试验这种武器两三年，并且在苏联、美国和英国境内和在太平洋地区建立相应的监督站，以便观察承担这种义务的国家的执行情况。
    苏联理解您对继续试验原子武器和氢武器所表示的不安，并且欢迎您们关于停止试验这类武器的呼吁。
