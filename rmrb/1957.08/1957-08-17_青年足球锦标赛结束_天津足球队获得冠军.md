Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 15th. The 1957 twelve-unit Youth Football Championship concluded today. The Tianjin team, adept at fast attacks, won the championship. The Yanbian team, known for its courageous style, had the same points as Tianjin in the finals, but had one less goal difference, and therefore was the runner-up. The Lüda team came in third.

The Guangzhou team, with its skillful techniques, had the best results in the preliminary stage, but its physical strength weakened in the finals stage, losing 0-2 to both Tianjin and Lüda, and drawing 3-3 with Yanbian, resulting in fourth place.

The last match this afternoon was the competition between the Shenyang team and the Shanghai team for fifth place. These two teams were the champions and runners-up of last year's Youth Football Championship, but neither team qualified for the finals stage to compete for the top four in the preliminary stage. As a result of this match, the Shenyang team defeated the Shanghai team 1-0, winning fifth place. According to the number of points, the Chongqing team came in sixth. The Shanghai team finished eighth.

The more than two hundred athletes participating in this competition were all young workers and students between the ages of seventeen and twenty. Since the competition started on July 28th, a total of forty-eight matches have been played.

    新华社天津15日电  1957年十二单位青年足球锦标赛今天结束。善于快速进攻的天津队获得了冠军。作风勇猛的延边队在决赛中同天津队积分相等，但净胜球数比天津队少一个球，而退居亚军。旅大队得了第三名。
    球技灵巧的广州队在预赛阶段成绩最好，但在决赛阶段体力减弱，先后以○比二败给天津队和旅大队，并以三比三同延边队踢成平局，结果得了第四名。
    今天下午最后一场是沈阳队同上海队争夺第五名的比赛。这两个队是去年青年足球锦标赛的冠军和亚军，但是在预赛阶段都没有获得争夺前四名的决赛权。这场比赛结果，沈阳队以一比零胜上海队，获得了第五名。按积分的多少，重庆队得了第六名。上海队得第八名。
