The Enemies of the Omani People Are Acting in Concert
Commentator of this newspaper
Recent developments indicate that British colonialists are determined to suppress the Omani people's uprising in a frenzy. Britain has dispatched its air force to indiscriminately bomb Oman, even using rockets against the insurgents. Not only that, but the British government has also mobilized ground troops. A British colonial army has already arrived in the Buraimi Oasis from the Persian Gulf, awaiting to participate in the bloody suppression of the Omani insurgents.

However, the Omani people have not been intimidated by British armed intervention, and they are persevering in their heroic struggle. The insurgents' armed forces have now surrounded the oil-rich Saudi mountains. Oman's Imam's representative in Cairo, Halse, issued a statement on July 28, saying: "Our only condition is unconditional recognition of our independence. The Omani people are determined to fight until final victory and drive the invaders out of their territory." Halse's statement shows that no matter how frantic the British colonialists become, the Omani people's sacred desire for independence cannot be suppressed.

The British bloody suppression of the Omani people has once again shown the people of Arab countries that colonialism is the only threat to the independence and peace of the Middle East and Arab countries. This will further arouse the tide of anti-colonialist struggle of the Arab people. It is worth noting that Britain is currently stepping up its suppression of the Omani people in order, according to Western news agencies, to quickly resolve the issue so that the Omani issue does not "cause international disputes." This intention of Britain can be understood as Britain's fear that Arab countries will bring the Omani issue to the upcoming United Nations General Assembly. However, more importantly, Britain is doing this to protect its oil interests in the Persian Gulf and prevent prolonged delays, allowing the United States to intervene and further squeeze Britain's interests in the region.

Since the Omani people's uprising, the United States has adopted an ambiguous attitude. Facts have proved that the United States and Britain are united on the point that the Omani people's struggle for independence must be suppressed. In a statement issued by the US State Department, the just struggle of the Omani people was falsely called a "rebellion." The "New York Times," a mouthpiece of the US State Department, even maliciously fabricated rumors that "the real headquarters of the rebellion is in Cairo" and accused Egypt of having some "ambitions." A United Press International dispatch on July 29 even bluntly admitted that the US State Department "hoped" that "the rebellion would soon be put down." This is the basic position of the United States on the Oman issue - a dirty imperialist position.

On the other hand, the United States is also trying to take the opportunity to undermine Britain's position and expand American colonial power into the oil-rich Persian Gulf. Because of this, the United States has expressed serious concern about the entry of British troops into the Buraimi Oasis, and believes that this is a "blow" to the United States. There are already reports that US Secretary of State Dulles, taking the opportunity to go to London to collude with Britain to obstruct disarmament, will discuss "Anglo-American differences on the Oman issue" with British Foreign Secretary Lloyd. London's "Daily Mail" also pointed out: "The development of the situation has brought the long-standing Anglo-American dispute over Buraimi to a critical juncture." It is quite obvious that Dulles' trip to London is charged with the task of putting pressure on Britain to force Britain to transfer more of the Persian Gulf's oil secrets to the United States. One of the important reasons why Britain is eager to end the Oman affair with bloody suppression is to avoid giving the United States a chance to intervene.

Obviously, the Omani people's struggle for independence is arduous. Because they are facing not only British imperialism, but also American imperialism, which is more insidious and vicious than Britain. These two enemies are now acting in concert. However, today, when the Arab people are becoming more and more aware of the faces of the imperialists, as long as the Omani people remain vigilant, their struggle for independence will eventually be victorious, and the imperialists' conspiracy will eventually fail.

    阿曼人民的敌人一齐动手了
    本报评论员
    最近几天的情况表明，英国殖民主义者决心疯狂地镇压阿曼人民的起义。英国出动了空军对阿曼滥施轰炸，甚至使用火箭武器轰击起义者。不但如此，英国政府还调动了地面部队。一支英国殖民军已经从波斯湾开到了布赖米绿洲，以待参加对阿曼起义者的血腥镇压。
    但是，阿曼人民并没有被英国的武装干涉所吓倒，他们正在坚持着英勇的斗争。起义者的武装力量现在已经包围了有丰富的石油资源的沙乌德山区。阿曼教长驻开罗代表哈尔赛7月28日发表声明说：“我们唯一的条件是无条件地承认我们的独立。阿曼人决心要战斗到取得最后胜利，把侵略者驱逐出他们的领土为止。”哈尔赛的这个声明表明：无论英国殖民主义者如何疯狂，阿曼人民要求独立的神圣愿望是不可能被压制的。
    英国对阿曼人民的血腥镇压，使阿拉伯各国人民又一次看到，殖民主义是中东和阿拉伯各国的独立与和平的唯一的威胁。这将更加激起阿拉伯人民反殖民主义的斗争怒潮。值得注意的是，英国目前对阿曼人民加紧镇压，据西方通讯社透露，是为了迅速解决问题，使阿曼问题不致“造成国际纠纷”。英国这种打算，可以理解为英国害怕阿拉伯国家把阿曼问题提到即将举行的联合国大会上去。但是，英国这样做，更重要的是为了保护自己在波斯湾的石油利益，防止夜长梦多，使美国得以插手进一步排挤英国在这个地区的利益。
    自从阿曼人民起义以来，美国一直采取了暧昧的态度。事实证明：在必须镇压阿曼人民争取独立的斗争这一点上，美国同英国是一致的。美国国务院在发表的一个声明中，把阿曼人民的正义斗争诬称为“叛乱”。美国国务院的喉舌“纽约时报”甚至心怀叵测地造谣说，“叛变的真正总部是在开罗”，并且反噬埃及有什么“野心”。合众社7月29日的电讯更直截了当地承认，美国国务院“希望”“叛乱即将被扑灭”。这就是美国对阿曼事件的基本立场——肮脏的帝国主义的立场。
    另一方面，美国又企图乘机挖掉英国的墙脚，把美国的殖民势力扩展到盛产石油的波斯湾去。正因为这样，美国对于英国军队开入布赖米绿洲一事表示严重的不安，并且认为这是对美国的一个“打击”。已经有消息说，美国国务卿杜勒斯借着到伦敦去同英国合谋阻挠裁军的机会，将和英国外交大臣劳埃德讨论“英美在阿曼问题上的分歧”。伦敦的“每日邮报”并且指出：“局势的发展已经使英美关于布赖米的长期争执达于重要关头。”十分明显，这次杜勒斯的伦敦之行，是负有向英国施加压力的任务，以迫使英国更多地把波斯湾的石油秘密出让给美国。英国所以急于用血腥镇压来结束阿曼事件，其重要原因之一，就是为了不给美国以插手的机会。
    显然，阿曼人民争取独立的斗争是艰苦的。因为他们所面对的不仅是一个英国帝国主义，而且还有比英国更为阴险毒辣的美国帝国主义，这两个敌人现在一齐动手了。但是，在阿拉伯人民对帝国主义者的面目认识得越来越清楚的今天，只要阿曼人民保持警惕，他们争取独立的斗争终将胜利，而帝国主义的阴谋终将失败。
