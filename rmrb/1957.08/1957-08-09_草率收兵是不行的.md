Hasty Retreat Is Not Acceptable

The people of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Health believed that the three rightists who had been struggled against there—Jin Songpan, Zhu Tongli, and Huang Lanyan—had already bowed their heads and confessed their guilt, and that the anti-rightist struggle could be brought to a close and the rectification campaign in the department could continue.

However, upon re-examination, it was discovered that things were not so simple. Although Jin Songpan expressed his submission to the people, he regarded the struggle against him as an act of retaliation by the leadership, believing that if he hadn't offered suggestions to the director of the department, he wouldn't have become a rightist. Zhu Tongli only admitted that his attitude was bad and was still not entirely convinced by the struggle against him. Huang Lanyan had written a "letter of accusation" to the Jiangsu Provincial People's Procuratorate, viciously slandering the anti-counterrevolutionary movement, but he didn't mention this at all in his self-criticism. Zhu, Huang, and Jin Songpan had a very close relationship, and they hadn't explained their activities together. After analyzing and studying these situations, the Department of Health decided to provide supplementary lessons and continue the struggle against these three rightists separately.

The decision of the Department of Health is correct, and this matter is a beneficial lesson for us. That is: eliminate evil completely; the anti-rightist struggle must be thorough. If we are satisfied with superficial and temporary results and hastily retreat, we will certainly leave future troubles behind.

    草率收兵是不行的
    江苏省卫生厅的人们，认为他们那里三个被斗争的右派分子金诵盘、朱同礼、黄兰言已经低头认罪，可以把反右派斗争告一段落，继续进行机关整风了。
    可是重新一检查，发现事情并不那么简单。金诵盘虽然表示向人民低头，但他把斗争他看成是领导上的报复行为，认为如果不是向厅长提了意见，他就不会成为右派。朱同礼只承认自己的态度不好，对斗争他还不大服气。黄兰言曾经给江苏省人民检察院写过一封“控告信”，恶毒地诬蔑肃反运动，而他检查中对这事竟一字未提。朱、黄和金诵盘的关系很密切，他们之间的活动情况也未交代。在分析研究了这些情况之后，卫生厅决定分别对这三个右派分子进行补课，继续斗争。
    卫生厅的这个决定是正确的，这件事对我们是一个有益的教训。这就是：除恶务尽，反右派斗争必须彻底。如果满足于表面的暂时的效果，而草率收兵，一定贻患将来的。
