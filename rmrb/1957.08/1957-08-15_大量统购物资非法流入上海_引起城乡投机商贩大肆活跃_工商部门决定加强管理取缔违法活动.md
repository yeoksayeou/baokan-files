Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 14th (Xinhua News Agency Reporter Zhang Jiazhi): Since the opening of the free market, a large quantity of goods subject to state purchase or unified acquisition, such as grain and oil, have been flowing illegally into Shanghai, becoming a serious problem violating the state purchase and supply system and unified acquisition decrees. According to the Shanghai Municipal Industry and Commerce Administration, as many as twenty-five types (categories) of such goods have been found on the market. Among them, grain, oil, and cotton are subject to state purchase and supply, while pork, tea, goat wool, hemp, homespun cloth, raw silk, and traditional Chinese medicine are subject to unified acquisition by the central and local governments, totaling twenty-two types.

The largest inflows and the most serious situations involve oil, pork, and beans among grains. At its peak, more than 80,000 jin of peanuts were seized in a single month; pork seizures reached 200,000 to 300,000 jin in a month. According to the Shanghai Grain Bureau's findings at the Dada Wharf and North Railway Station, sometimes more than half of the passengers arriving from northern Jiangsu Province were carrying peanuts. The situation of private boats smuggling peanuts and other oilseeds is even more serious, with each boat carrying at least 1,000 jin and as much as 3,000 to 4,000 jin. On the streets outside the Dada Wharf free market established by the state, state-purchased goods such as peanuts, soybeans, broad beans, mung beans, and edible oil were openly sold at high prices without requiring grain or oil coupons, effectively becoming a free market for grain and oil.

These goods found in the Shanghai market are partly produced and sold by farmers and agricultural cooperatives themselves, partly transported by farmers for profit, and partly transported by small merchants and peddlers. However, they all evade state management and sell at prices 20% to 350% higher than the state-owned companies' listed prices.

It is worth noting that this illegal transaction has stirred rampant activity among speculators. Some scalpers in Shanghai even go to the countryside to lure farmers to transport large quantities of goods, and openly operate in tea houses and markets, engaging in large transactions involving thousands of jin. Oilseeds, raw silk, leather, and other items have also flowed into "spontaneous factories." According to a survey by the Animal Products Company, the influx of goat wool has led to the development of more than 100 spontaneous workshops engaged in goat wool processing and finishing at one point. The number of spontaneous sugar factories and roasting shops processing peanuts and soybeans is even greater, and even large stores like Wing On Company purchase hundreds of jin of roasted peanuts and peanut candies from them.

Another issue worth noting is that the oilseed acquisition plans in Nantong and Yangzhou Special Zones in northern Jiangsu have not been well completed, but most of the peanuts and other oilseeds in the Shanghai free market are smuggled from these areas. Some local leading departments have not adequately educated and stopped this capitalist tendency in rural areas to evade the state purchase system. The Shanghai free market has even seen agricultural cooperatives selling large quantities of oilseeds and broad beans in their name. The Pinghu County People's Committee in Zhejiang Province also issued a certificate to the county's supply and marketing cooperative to sell peanut kernels in Shanghai at a price more than double the state purchase price.

Currently, the Shanghai Municipal Industry and Commerce Administration has, in conjunction with relevant departments, decided to strengthen market management of goods subject to state purchase and unified acquisition. In addition to strengthening publicity and education for farmers at transportation hubs such as railway stations and wharves, units such as grain companies and oil companies have strengthened inspection and purchasing efforts. From July 21st to August 1st, the Grain Company acquired 8,135 jin of grains such as rice, broad beans, and mung beans in the Dongjiadu Wharf area alone in eleven days. The relevant departments will strictly ban illegal merchants engaged in speculation and serious violations of the law.

### 大量统购物资非法流入上海  引起城乡投机商贩大肆活跃  工商部门决定加强管理取缔违法活动

    大量统购物资非法流入上海
    引起城乡投机商贩大肆活跃
    工商部门决定加强管理取缔违法活动
    新华社上海14日电　新华社记者张家炽报道：粮食、油料等属于国家统购的或规定统一收购的物资，在自由市场开放后大量流入上海，已经成为一个严重违反国家统购统销制度和统一收购法令的问题。据上海市工商行政部门了解，这些物资目前在市场上发现的已经有二十五种（类）之多。其中属于国家统购统销的物资有粮食、油料、棉花等三种，属于中央和地方规定统一收购的有猪肉、茶叶、山羊毛、麻、土布、土丝、中药材等二十二种。
    流入数量最多，情况最严重的是油料、猪肉和粮食中的豆类。花生流入最多时，一个月内经查获收购的有八万多斤；猪肉查获最多时一个月内有二、三十万斤。据上海市粮食局在大达码头、北站两个地点发现，从苏北方面来沪旅客中，有时竟有半数以上携带花生。木船私运花生等油料的情况更为严重，每船少则千斤，多的有三、四千斤。在国家设立的大达码头自由市场外面的街道上，花生、大豆、蚕豆、绿豆和食油等国家统购物资，竟不收粮票、油票而高价出售，俨然成为一个粮食、油料的自由市场。
    上海市场上发现的这些物资，有的是属于农民和农业社自产自销的，有的是农民经商贩运的，有的是小商小贩贩运的。但他们都逃避国家管理，以高出国营公司牌价20％到350％的高价出售。
    值得注意的是：这种非法的交易，已经引起投机商贩大肆活跃。上海市有的黄牛掮客甚至下乡勾引农民大量贩运，并在茶楼市场上公开活动，进行成千斤的大笔交易。油料、土丝、皮革等还流入了“自发工厂”。据畜产公司调查，由于山羊毛的流入，经营山羊毛加工整理的自发作坊一度发展到一百多家。加工花生、大豆的自发糖厂和炒坊为数更多，甚至永安公司这些大商店也向它们成百斤地采购炒花生和花生糖。
    值得注意的另一个问题是：苏北南通、扬州等专区油料收购计划都完成得不好，但上海自由市场上的花生等油料却大部分是从这些地区偷运来的。对于农村中的这种逃避国家统购制度的资本主义倾向，有的地区的领导部门并没有很好地给予教育和制止。在上海自由市场上甚至还发现以农业社名义出售大量油料、蚕豆的现象。浙江省平湖县人民委员会也曾经出证明给这个县的供销合作社，以高出国家统购价一倍以上的价格在上海出售花生仁。
    目前上海市工商行政管理局已经会同有关部门决定加强对国家统购物资和统一收购物资的市场管理。除了在车站、码头等交通要道加强对农民的宣传教育以外，粮食公司、油脂公司等单位已加强检查和收购力量。粮食公司在7月21日到8月1日的十一天中，就在董家渡码头一个地区收购了大米、蚕豆、绿豆等粮食八千一百三十五斤。对于投机倒把、严重违法的不法商贩，有关部门将予严格取缔。
