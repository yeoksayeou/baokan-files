Kunming Dispatch: Since mid-June, more than 200 units and nearly 20,000 people in Kunming City have participated in the struggle against Rightist elements. Currently, the struggle is developing in depth.

After the struggle against the Rightist element Zhang Shen of the Intermediate People's Court was launched, the masses consistently adhered to reasoning-based struggle, repeatedly refuting his fallacies such as "abolishing the Party committee system in the government, abolishing the Party group in the court, and establishing an administrative committee with non-Party members to lead" and his reactionary remarks that slandered courts at all levels as "the central government disregards the law, the lower levels are lawless, and there are indiscriminate killings." Recently, he confessed to colluding with Cai Ying, a traitor to the Party, to form an anti-Party clique, attempting to overthrow the president of the court and seize leadership.

The Federation of Industry and Commerce Training Class exposed a reactionary clique headed by the Rightist element Yan Zhenbang (member of the China Democratic National Construction Association and section chief of the Municipal Automobile Transportation Company).

The struggle against the Rightist element Zhou Zhenyun (member of the China Democratic League, deputy director of the Municipal Health Bureau, and member of the Municipal People's Political Consultative Conference) in the Municipal Health Bureau has spread from the Health Bureau to the entire city's health system. Participants in the struggle sternly refuted Zhou's absurd remarks that slandered Party members as the "evil mother-in-law" in the "Peacock Flies Southeast" drama, League members as the "young sister-in-law," and the masses as the "daughter-in-law." Now, Zhou Zhenyun has begun to bow his head and confess his crimes to the masses.

More than 30 ordinary middle schools and secondary technical schools in Kunming also launched a struggle against the Rightists during the summer vacation.

Several large factories and mines in Kunming, as well as urban streets and rural agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs, have universally publicized the great significance of the struggle against Rightists through report meetings, forums, blackboards, reading groups, and other forms. Through publicity and learning, workers, peasants, and urban residents have greatly enhanced their awareness and ability to identify Rightist remarks.
