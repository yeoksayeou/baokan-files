    Beijing Woolen Textile Factory Trial Production
    Annual Production of Serge Sufficient for 700,000 People to Make One Suit Each
    Beside the Qinghe Woolen Mill in the northern suburbs, its newly built sister factory, the Beijing Woolen Textile Factory, has begun trial production. Young female workers are spinning Australian wool tops into fine, silky white yarn, which is then woven and dyed into various beautiful colors of serge.

    This new factory has 10,400 spindles and a complete set of weaving and dyeing equipment, and can produce 1.95 million meters of serge annually. This serge can be used to make 700,000 sets of uniforms. This factory is currently the largest factory in China producing fine woolen fabrics. Its equipment, such as high-speed roving frames, anti-shrinkage machines, and voltage machines, are all the latest. Wool fabrics treated with the anti-shrinkage machine will no longer shrink and are not afraid of being moth-eaten. This factory will officially go into production in the fourth quarter of this year. In addition to meeting domestic needs, its products will also be exported in part. It is estimated that it will be able to earn back its entire investment six months after starting operation.

    北京市毛纺织厂试生产
    年产哔叽可供七十万人各做一套衣服
    在北郊清河制呢厂西边，新建成的她的姊妹厂——北京市毛纺织厂已经开始试生产。年青的女工们把一团团澳洲毛条，纺成纤细如丝的白纱，再织染成各种颜色漂亮的哔叽。
    这个新厂拥有一万零四百个锭子和全套织染设备，每年可以生产哔叽一百九十五万公尺，用这些哔叽可以做七十万套制服。这个工厂是目前我国最大的生产精毛织品的工厂。它的设备如高速粗纱机、防缩机、电压机等都是最新式的，经过防缩机处理的毛织品不会再收缩，也不怕被虫蛀。这个工厂将在今年第四季度正式投入生产，它的产品除了供应国内需要以外，还要出口一部分。预计开工半年以后，它就可以将全部投资赚回来。
