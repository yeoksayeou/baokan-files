One of the newly emerging contradictions in China's industrial development is that the development of raw material industries is lagging behind the needs of the processing and manufacturing industries, the construction industry, and the people's livelihood, which increases the tension in raw materials during the construction process. For example, during the period of the First Five-Year Plan, the average annual growth rate of coal was about 13%, which was already quite high. However, the growth rate of coal demand from all sectors was even higher. During the same period, the average annual growth rate of coal for production and domestic use was about 17%. The contradiction between production and needs in other raw material industries is roughly the same. In order to enable all sectors of China's industry to achieve rapid development, it is necessary to vigorously develop the raw material industry in the near future to solve this contradiction.

To develop the raw material industry so that it can fully meet the needs of China's processing and manufacturing industries, the construction industry, and the people's livelihood, the state must first plan to build a batch of large-scale, modern coal, ferrous metal, non-ferrous metal, non-metal, petroleum, and salt-alkali mines and mining fields as the basic raw material base for China's industrialization. Without this basic raw material base, China's socialist industrialization would be unthinkable. During China's First Five-Year Plan for developing the national economy, great efforts were made to develop China's raw material industry and build many large-scale modern raw material industrial enterprises, initially establishing a raw material base for China's industrialization. This was completely necessary and correct. For example, before 1956, the Ministry of Coal Industry had built a total of 101 mines and mining fields. In terms of mine size, there were 32 mines with an annual production capacity of less than 300,000 tons, 37 mines with a capacity between 300,000 and 450,000 tons, and 32 mines with a capacity of more than 600,000 tons. The average size of each mine was 432,000 tons. It is precisely because we have built and are building such a batch of new mines, and appropriately expanding and renovating the existing mines, that we have been able to increase China's coal production capacity by more than 40 million tons in 1956 compared to 1952, which is about 70% of the total production capacity before liberation. In addition to the coal industry, the production capacity of pig iron has also increased significantly. The output in 1957 is expected to reach 6 million tons, which is about four times the highest annual output before liberation. At the same time, the exploitation of non-ferrous metals, petroleum, and non-metallic minerals has also developed greatly. Obviously, if there had not been the large-scale construction mentioned above in the development of the raw material industry, the contradiction between the production and needs of the raw material industry would have been even more prominent.

However, it should be noted that not all raw material industries should adopt large-scale modern mines and mining fields for exploitation. This is not only because some areas have limited resource conditions and are not suitable for building large-scale modern raw material industrial enterprises, but also because the size of enterprise construction, in addition to resource conditions, depends on whether China's actual needs are urgent, how much the supply capacity of imported and self-manufactured equipment is, and must be comprehensively studied based on transportation, investment possibilities, and the rate of return on capital, in order to determine whether it is more cost-effective to build large or small and medium-sized enterprises.

Because China's economy is backward, industrial distribution is unbalanced, some areas have abundant natural resources while others have less, some areas are concentrated while others are scattered, and China's labor force is very abundant. Therefore, when developing the raw material industry, in addition to planning to build a batch of large-scale modern mines and mining fields based on resource conditions, economic zoning, and industrial distribution, we should also build more medium-sized, small-sized, and manually operated mines and mining fields. And combine the development of the two. According to China's specific conditions, building such medium-sized and small-sized and manually operated mines and mining fields has many advantages. It requires less investment, is easy to build, and yields quick results; it can make the production of raw materials closer to consumption areas, making industrial distribution more reasonable; it can expand social employment and give full play to China's advantageous conditions of abundant human resources; we are fully capable of designing and manufacturing equipment for such medium-sized or small-sized mines and mining fields ourselves. These are the reasons why we must adopt a positive attitude towards the development of medium-sized, small-sized, and manually operated mines and mining fields.

Local Party committees and governments bear great responsibility for developing medium-sized, small-sized, and manually operated coal mines, iron mines, non-ferrous metal mines, non-metallic mines, salt fields, alkali fields, etc. Such enterprises can be run by provincial, prefectural, or county governments, or by relevant handicraft cooperatives, or by agricultural production cooperatives as a sideline. As long as there are local resources that can be utilized, adopting small-scale or handicraft exploitation methods does not hinder or damage the state's rational utilization of such resources, and there is a guarantee that the extracted products will have sales outlets, exploitation can be carried out. As long as the leading organs at all levels attach importance to it and strengthen specific organizational work, it is entirely possible to develop medium-sized, small-sized, and manually operated raw material industries. For example, in recent years, with the advocacy of Party committees and governments at all levels, in the past three years, the output of locally manually mined coal has doubled, and the output of locally produced pig iron has increased nearly sevenfold. This proves that there is much that can be done locally in developing the raw material industry.

Among the raw material industries operated by local authorities, some are suitable for operation by provinces, prefectures, or counties, depending on resource and capital conditions, and of course, they should be operated by them respectively. Some are not suitable for their operation, and should be operated by cooperatives or individuals. For example, at present, there are more than 2,000 small coal kilns operated by agricultural production cooperatives in Sichuan Province. The exploitation of non-ferrous metals in Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan and other provinces can also be carried out collectively by the masses.

In short, developing the raw material industry, especially mobilizing and organizing the masses to develop small coal kilns, small iron mines, small non-ferrous metal mines, small non-metallic mines, small salt fields, small alkali fields, etc., is not only of important economic significance, but also of important political significance. This can not only solve a newly emerging contradictory problem in China's industrial development; but also because production develops, the number of employed people increases, and people's income increases, it can improve life more and is more conducive to correctly handling contradictions among the people. Therefore, we should vigorously develop the raw material industry, and in particular, we should mobilize and organize the broad masses to develop the raw material industry.

### 必须解决工业发展中的一个矛盾问题

    必须解决工业发展中的一个矛盾问题
    我国工业发展过程中新出现的矛盾之一，是原材料工业的发展赶不上加工制造工业、建筑业和人民生活的需要，这就增加了建设过程中原材料紧张的情况。例如，在第一个五年计划期间，煤炭每年平均增长的速度约为13％左右，这个速度本来是相当高的。但是，各方面对于煤炭需要量的增长速度更高。在同一时期，生产用煤和生活用煤每年平均增长的速度都是17％左右。其他原材料工业在生产同需要之间的矛盾，大体上也是这样。为了使我国工业各部门获得迅速的发展，必须在最近期间大力发展原材料工业，以便解决这一矛盾。
    要发展原材料工业，使它能够充分地满足我国加工制造工业、建筑业和人民生活的需要，国家必须首先有计划地建设一批大型的现代化的煤炭、黑色金属、有色金属、非金属、石油以及盐碱等矿井和采掘场，作为我国工业化的基本的原材料基地。如果没有这种基本的原材料基地，我国的社会主义工业化将是不可设想的。在我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划期间，曾用了很大的力量来发展我国的原材料工业，建设了许多大型的现代化的原材料工业企业，初步地建立起我国工业化的原材料基地，这是完全必要的也是完全正确的。例如，煤炭工业部在1956年以前，总共建设了矿井和采掘场一百零一处。井型的规模，每年生产能力在三十万吨以下的有三十二处，在三十至四十五万吨之间的有三十七处，在六十万吨以上的有三十二处。平均每个矿井的规模是四十三万二千吨。正因为我们建设了和建设着这样一批新的矿井，并且对原有的矿井加以适当的扩建和改建，才能够使我国煤炭的生产能力在1956年比1952年增加四千多万吨，约等于解放前全部生产能力的70％左右。除了煤炭工业之外，生铁的生产能力也有很大的增长，1957年产量预计可以达到六百万吨，约等于解放前最高年产量的四倍。同时有色金属、石油、非金属矿的开采也有很大的发展。显而易见，如果在发展原材料工业方面，没有上面所说的规模巨大的建设，那么，原材料工业的生产同需要之间的矛盾，将会更加突出。
    但是应当看到，并不是所有的原材料工业，都应当采取大型的近代化的矿井和采掘场来开采。这不仅因为有些地区资源条件有限制，不适宜建设大型的近代化的原材料工业企业，而且因为企业建设规模的大小，除了资源条件以外，还要看我国的实际需要是否迫切，进口的和自己制造的设备供应能力有多大，并且要根据交通运输、投资可能以及按资金计算的利润率的大小等等条件，综合地加以研究，才能确定究竟是建设大型的或者是中小型的企业更为合算。
    由于我国经济落后，工业分布不平衡，自然资源有的地区多，有的地区少，有的地区集中，有的地区分散，而我国的人力又很充分。因此，在发展原材料工业的时候，除根据资源条件、经济区划和工业分布的情况，有计划地建设一批大型的现代化的矿井和采掘场以外，还应当建设更多的中型的、小型的以及用手工开采的矿井和采掘场。并且使两者的发展结合起来。根据我国的具体条件，建设这种中型的和小型的以及用手工开采的矿井、采掘场，是有很多优点的。它投资少，建设易，收效快；它能使原材料的生产更加接近消费地区，使工业分布更加合理；它可以扩大社会就业，充分地发挥我国人力资源丰富的有利条件；这种中型的或者小型的矿井和采掘场，我们完全有可能自己进行设计和自行制造设备。这些就是为什么我们对于中型的、小型的以及用手工开采的矿井和采掘场的发展必须采取积极态度的理由。
    在发展中型的、小型的以及手工开采的煤矿、铁矿、有色金属矿、非金属矿、盐场、碱场等等方面，地方党和政府负有很大的责任。这种企业，可以由省的、专区的、县的政府开办，也可以由有关的手工业合作社开办，或者由农业生产合作社作为副业来开办。只要当地有可资利用的资源，采取小规模的或者手工业的开采方式也不妨碍或者破坏国家对于这种资源的合理利用，并且开采出来的东西又保证有销路者，都可以进行开采。只要各级领导机关重视，并且加强具体的组织工作，发展中型的、小型的以及用手工开采的原材料工业是完全可能的。例如，近年来经过各级党和政府的倡导，最近三年之间，地方手工开采的煤炭的产量增加一倍，地方生产的生铁增加将近七倍。这就证明，地方在发展原材料工业方面是大有可为的。
    在地方经营的原材料工业中，根据资源的条件和资金的条件，有些适于由省或者专区或者县经营的，当然应当分别由它们去经营，有些不适于它们经营的，则应当由合作社或者个人来经营。例如目前四川省农业生产合作社经营的小煤窑即达两千余个。江西、广东、广西、云南等省有色金属的开采，也可以由群众集体地去开采。
    总之，发展原材料工业，特别是发动与组织群众来发展小窑煤、小铁矿、小有色金属矿、小非金属矿、小盐场、小碱场等等，不仅有重要的经济意义，而且有重要的政治意义。这不但能够解决我国工业发展过程中新出现的一个矛盾问题；而且因为生产发展了，就业人数增加了，人民收入增加了，就可以更多地改善生活，就更有利于正确地处理人民内部的矛盾。所以我们应当大力发展原材料工业，特别应当发动和组织广大群众来发展原材料工业。
