Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, August 19th: Syria's newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and Chief of Staff, Major General Bizri (formerly translated as Bizraihe), and Deputy Chief of Staff Nifli, took office on August 18th.

　　Bizri is considered a patriotic Syrian general and has the support of the vast majority of Syrian officers.

　　On the same day, ten senior Syrian military officers were dismissed by order of the Syrian President. These ten senior military officers are: Front Commander Major General Taleb Daghistani and Brigadier General Mahmoud Shawkat, Tank Force Commander Brigadier General Bashshawr, and seven officers with the rank of colonel.

　　The orders for the appointment and dismissal of these senior military officers were all signed by President Kuwatly before leaving Damascus for Cairo.

　　Syrian Prime Minister Asali and many cabinet members denied on August 18th the rumors that Kuwatly had resigned from his position as president. During Kuwatly's absence, Syrian Parliament Speaker Kudsi will act as president.

　　Meanwhile, Damascus officials said that the Syrian government has instructed Syrian Ambassador to Italy Dr. Jabi to recall the diplomatic passport of Colonel Ibrahim Hosseini, the military attaché of the embassy, because his position has been terminated. Hosseini is one of the main figures in the conspiracy to subvert the current Syrian government.

　　After the American conspiracy to subvert the current Syrian government was exposed and the Syrian government took a series of measures to safeguard national independence, Western propaganda agencies have issued a large amount of provocative propaganda in recent days, saying that a "coup" is about to take place in Syria, that "leftists completely control the army," and that "a Kurdish rebellion is about to occur."

　　Syrian officials pointed out on August 18th that these messages were "completely fabricated by the American propaganda machine" as part of a "smear campaign" against Syria. These people said that Syria will never become a satellite state of any country because "it will never give up its independence or neutrality."

    叙利亚罢黜十个高级军官
    驳斥美国宣传机器的挑拨性谣言
    新华社大马士革19日电　叙利亚新任武装部队总司令兼参谋长比兹里（前译比兹赖赫）少将和副参谋长尼福里已经在8月18日就职。
    比兹里被认为是叙利亚的爱国将领，他得到绝大多数叙利亚军官的支持。
    同一天，有十名叙利亚高级军官根据叙利亚总统的命令被免职。这十名高级军官是：前线司令塔莱卜·达吉斯塔尼少将和马茂德·萧卡特准将，坦克部队司令巴什晓尔准将以及七个上校衔军官。
    对这些高级军官的任免命令都是库阿特利总统在离开大马士革去开罗之前签署的。
    叙利亚总理阿萨利和许多内阁阁员8月18日都否认传说库阿特利已经辞去总统职务的消息。在库阿特利离职期间，叙利亚议会议长库德西将代理总统职务。
    同时，大马士革官方人士说，叙利亚政府已经训令叙利亚驻意大利大使贾比博士收回大使馆武官易卜拉欣·侯赛尼上校的外交护照，因为他的职务已经被解除。侯赛尼是企图颠覆叙利亚现政府的阴谋案中的主要分子之一。
    在企图颠覆叙利亚现政府的美国阴谋案被揭发以及叙利亚政府采取一系列的保障国家独立的措施以后，西方宣传机构这几天发出了大量挑拨性的宣传，说叙利亚即将发生“政变”，“左翼分子完全控制了军队”，“库尔德族即将发生叛乱”。
    叙利亚官方人士18日指出，这些消息“完全是由美国宣传机器捏造的”，以作为对叙利亚的“诽谤运动的一部分”。这些人士说，叙利亚永远不会成为任何国家的卫星国，因为“它永远不会放弃它的独立或中立”。
