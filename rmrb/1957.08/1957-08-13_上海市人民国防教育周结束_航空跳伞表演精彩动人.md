Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 11th: Shanghai saw 250,000 people today watching the final and most exciting event of Shanghai People's National Defense Education Week—an aerial and parachuting skills performance.

	When four jet planes appeared in the sky, the cheers of the audience on the ground mingled with their roar. The jet planes performed many techniques for the audience, such as formation flying, rolls, loops, and high-speed flight.

	The parachuting team of the Chinese People's National Defense Sports Association performed a parachute stunt involving a free fall from an altitude of 2,200 meters. They only opened their parachutes 30 seconds after jumping out of the plane, and in that instant, they also made two figure-eight turns. The parachutists also demonstrated techniques such as dual parachute landings and pinpoint parachute jumps. This was the first time a parachuting performance had been held in Shanghai.

	Shanghai People's National Defense Education Week started on August 4th and ended today. During this week, more than 100 national defense sports activities were held, including shooting, offshore voyages, motorcycle driving, airplane models, ship models, and semaphore communication, with a total of 350,000 participants.

    上海市人民国防教育周结束
    航空跳伞表演精彩动人
    新华社上海11日电　上海今天有二十五万人观看了上海市人民国防教育周的最后一个精彩节目——航空、跳伞技术表演。
    当四架喷气飞机在上空出现的时候，地面上观众的欢呼同它的轰鸣响成一片。喷气机为观众们表演了编队、滚转、翻身和高速度飞行等许多技术。
    中国人民国防体协跳伞运动队表演了二千二百公尺高空自由坠落的跳伞特技。他们在跳出飞机以后三十秒钟才开伞，就在这一刹那间，还作了两个（8）字型的转弯。跳伞运动员还表演了双伞降落、定点跳伞等技巧。跳伞表演在上海还是第一次举行。
    上海市人民国防教育周从8月4日开始到今天结束。这一个星期内举行了射击、出海远航、摩托驾驶、飞机模型、舰船模型和手旗通讯等国防体育活动一百多次，总共有三十五万人参加。
