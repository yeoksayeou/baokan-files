Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 16th. Indonesian Communist Party General Secretary D. N. Aidit today gave an interview to reporters regarding Indonesia's current political and economic problems. He said that he is not opposed to holding a national consultative conference between the central government and local authorities, but this conference should be presided over by the central government, and the conference's resolutions must be binding. If some issues cannot be agreed upon during the conference, the government should make a decision after listening to opinions on these issues.

Aidit said that in resolving Indonesia's current financial difficulties, the government would do well to abandon the idea of increasing the people's burden and should instead start by weakening colonialist economic forces. Aidit believes that the result of the government's promulgation of the new import and export regulations is primarily that foreign big capitalists have gained more profits, although the government's foreign exchange income has also increased somewhat; however, the losses suffered by the people and national enterprises due to rising prices are greater than the benefits obtained by the government. In this regard, Aidit specifically pointed out the need to consider the fact that rising prices have already shaken the people's trust in the government. He said that the time has come for the government to re-examine the new import and export regulations.

    艾地赞成召开全国协商会议
    主张削弱殖民主义经济势力解决财政困难
    据新华社雅加达16日电  印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地今天就印度尼西亚当前的政治经济问题对记者发表谈话。他说，他不反对举行中央和地方之间的全国协商会议，但是这个会议应当由中央政府主持，而且会议的决议必须具有约束性。如果在会议过程中有些问题不能取得一致协议，就应当由政府在听取了对这些问题的意见以后作出决定。
    艾地说，在解决印度尼西亚当前的财政困难问题上，政府最好放弃增加人民负担的想法，而应该从削弱殖民主义经济势力着手。艾地认为，政府公布新输出入条例的结果，首先是使外国大资本家获得了更多的利润，虽然政府的外汇收入也增加了一些；但是由于物价上涨而使人民和民族企业遭受的损失是大于政府所获得的利益的。在这方面，艾地特别指出需要考虑到物价上涨已经使人民对政府的信任发生动摇的这一情况。他说，现在已经到了政府应该重新检查新输出入条例的时候了。
