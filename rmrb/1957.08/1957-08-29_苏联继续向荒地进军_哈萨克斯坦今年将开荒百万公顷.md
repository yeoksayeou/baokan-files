　　The Soviet Union Continues to Advance into the Wasteland
　　Kazakhstan to Reclaim One Million Hectares of Wasteland This Year
    Moscow, August 28th (Report from our newspaper) – The Soviet Union continues to advance into the wasteland in Kazakhstan and Siberia. Collective farms and state farms in Kazakhstan have reclaimed another 909,000 hectares of wasteland. Among them, 100,000 hectares were reclaimed in the "Hungry Steppe," where state farms engaged in sugar beets, grapes, and tobacco have appeared on the originally uninhabited wasteland. This year, a total of one million hectares of wasteland will be reclaimed in Kazakhstan. In recent years, the Novosibirsk region has reclaimed more than one million hectares of wasteland. Last year, the new land provided the state with nearly 100 million poods of grain. The conference of party and economic activists in the state has unanimously decided to continue reclaiming wasteland and strive to deliver twice as much grain to the state within two years. In order to increase harvests next year, the conference decided to immediately begin reclaiming wasteland, aiming to reclaim more than one million hectares of wasteland this year. Party activists in the Krasnoyarsk Territory called on agricultural workers to reclaim another 20,000 hectares of wasteland in the next two years.

　　苏联继续向荒地进军
　  哈萨克斯坦今年将开荒百万公顷
    本报莫斯科28日电　苏联继续在哈萨克斯坦和西伯利亚向荒地进军。哈萨克斯坦集体农庄和国营农场又开垦了九十万零九千公顷荒地。其中十万公顷是在“饥饿草原”开垦的，在原来漫无人烟的荒原上出现了经营甜菜、葡萄、烟草的国营农场。今年在哈萨克斯坦总共将开垦一百万公顷荒地。新西伯利亚州最近几年开垦了一百多万公顷荒地。去年新地交给国家近一亿普特谷物。这个州的党和经济的积极分子会议，目前一致决定继续开荒，争取在两年内多交一倍的谷物给国家。为了明年能增加收成，会议决定立即开始开荒，要今年开垦一百万公顷以上荒地。克拉斯诺雅尔斯克边疆区党的积极分子号召农业劳动者在最近两年内再开垦两万公顷荒地。
