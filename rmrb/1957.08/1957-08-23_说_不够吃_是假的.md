　　Saying "Not Enough to Eat" is False
    In June of this year, I returned home to Puyang County, Henan. Before I had even sat down, an older female cousin from my clan spoke to me, mentioning that they wouldn't have enough grain to eat after the state requisition. The next day, when I visited relatives, I heard similar sentiments. Because I didn't understand the situation, I found it difficult to offer my own opinion at the time. So, I decided to first understand my family's grain consumption situation. Last year, according to regulations, each person retained 380 jin of grain for the whole year. In reality, including the surplus grain, each person had about 400 jin. My family has nine people in total, four adults (18 to 55 years old) and five children (3 to 12 years old), retaining approximately 3,600 jin of grain, of which fine grain accounts for one-third. By this year's wheat harvest, the family still had over 200 jin of grain left.
    I asked my wife: "Why is it that our family can't finish its grain, while some people are shouting that there's not enough to eat?" She said to me: "Don't just listen to the shouting. Actually, the people who are shouting about not having enough grain almost all have some leftover grain at home. Take the sixteen households in our production team, for example. Except for the team leader, who's a bit short on grain (because he's alone, doesn't have children to offset the average, and isn't good at cooking), the other households all have surpluses." She also said that this spring, my older cousin in the front yard was constantly complaining that he didn't have enough grain. He even "cried" about it in front of the agricultural cooperative chairman and accountant. But now it turns out that he still has old grain at home!
    One day, my maternal aunt and paternal aunt came to my house, and they also said that they didn't have enough grain to eat. Coincidentally, the older female cousin from my clan was also present. I disagreed with their statement and used my family's grain consumption as an example for them. My maternal aunt disagreed, saying: "Your family has many children, so they eat less." "Having many children is a factor," I said, "but some families have just as many children as mine, and they're also complaining about not having enough. What's the explanation for that?" I then used the older female cousin's family as an example. Her family has six people, with three children, the oldest of whom is only six years old. My paternal aunt's family has nine people, with six children. Comparing this, they then told me what they were really thinking. The older female cousin said: "I don't know why, but when others complain about not having enough grain, I also start complaining about not having enough. To be honest, our family hasn't eaten a single meal of bran and vegetables all year and haven't missed a single meal." She also said that villagers are just afraid of going hungry. The more grain they have, the better, even if they can't eat it all; it's good just to look at. My maternal aunt said:
  "It's always better to have more grain than less. If you want to spend money, you can sell a斗 (dǒu), and it's also convenient to trade for some dried vegetables (i.e., cellophane noodles)."
    Then we brought up some past events. In the old society, the older female cousin's and maternal aunt's families often didn't have enough to eat or wear. During the famine in 1942, the older female cousin almost starved to death. After liberation, their families were allocated land and joined agricultural cooperatives. Now they didn't have to worry about food and clothing. But the tragic scenes of hunger left by the old society are unforgettable. Last year, Puyang County had a bumper harvest of wheat and autumn crops. For them, the desire to keep more grain is understandable. However, they know little about the overall grain situation in the country. Although national grain production is increasing every year, the average is only about 600 jin per person. After deducting commodity grain and necessary reserves, dividing 400 jin of grain per person is not a small amount. As for Henan Province, due to disasters in some areas, some grain was imported from other provinces last year. The Party's policy is to ensure that everyone has food to eat. In 1954, my family's grain harvest was only enough to eat for three months (because some of the land was flooded). The state supplied grain for the nine months that the nine people were short of food. In the old society, people would have starved to death again. After we discussed these situations, they also felt that only thinking about their own convenience, complaining about not having enough grain, and asking for more grain to be retained was not the right thing to do. This also shows that it is very important to carry out political and ideological education work among farmers.

　　说“不够吃”是假的
    今年6月间，我回了一趟家——河南濮阳县。到家还没坐稳，有个同族老嫂和我说了几句话，就提起留粮不够吃。第二天我去串亲戚，也听到一些类似的反映。因为不了解情况，当时我很难提出自己的意见，于是我决定先了解我家的用粮情况。去年按规定每人全年留三百八十斤口粮，实际上连超产粮在内，每人合四百斤左右。我家共九口人，四个大人（十八岁至五十五岁），五个小孩（三岁至十二岁），共留口粮三千六百斤左右，其中细粮占三分之一。到今年麦收，全家还剩粮二百余斤。
    我问我妻子：“为什么咱家的粮食吃不完，而有的人叫喊粮食不够吃呢？”她对我说：“你不要光听叫喊，实际上叫喊粮食不够的人，差不多家里都有些剩余粮食。拿咱生产队十六户人家来说，除队长的粮食缺一些（因为就他一个人，没小孩搭配，加上做饭把握不好），别的户都有剩余。”她并说，今年春天，前院三哥到处吵粮食不够吃，他还在农庄主席和会计面前“哭”过，可是现在发现他家还有陈粮呢！
    一天，舅母和姑母来我家，她们也说粮食不够吃，凑巧同族老嫂也在座。我不同意她们的说法，就拿我家的用粮情况说给她们听。舅母表示不同意的说：“你家孩子多，吃的少”。“孩子多是个原因”，我说：“可是有的比我家的孩子也不少，也吵着不够吃，这是什么道理？”我就以同族老嫂家为例，她家六口人，有三个孩子，大的才六岁，姑母家九口人也有六个孩子。这一比，她们才说出了心里话。老嫂说：“不知咋的，别人一吵粮食不够，自己也跟着吵不够。说真的，咱家一年连一顿糠菜也没吃过，没缺过一顿饭。”还说，庄家人光怕挨饿，粮食越多越不嫌多，就是吃不了，看着也好。舅母说：
  “粮食留的多了总比少了强，想花钱时卖一斗，想换点干菜（即粉皮、粉条）也方便”。
    接着我们提起了一些往事。在旧社会里，老嫂和舅母家里经常少吃没穿。1942年闹灾荒，老嫂差点没饿死。解放后，她们家分得了土地，加入了农业社，吃穿都不愁了。可是旧社会给她们留下的饥饿惨景，是永远忘不了的。去年濮阳县麦秋都丰收了，在她们来说，想多留些粮食的心情是不难理解的。但是，她们却很少知道整个国家的粮食情况。虽然全国粮食收成每年增长，但每人平均才六百斤左右，除下商品粮和必要的储备粮，每人分到四百斤粮食已不算少了。就河南省而言，由于部分地区遭灾，去年还从外省调入了部分粮食。党的政策是要人人有饭吃。1954年我家收的粮食只够三个月吃（因部分地被水淹），九口人缺九个月的粮全由国家供应。这要在旧社会又要饿死人了。我们交谈了这些情况之后，她们也感到只顾自己方便，吵口粮不够吃，要求多留粮食的想法不对头。这也说明对农民进行政治思想教育工作十分重要。
