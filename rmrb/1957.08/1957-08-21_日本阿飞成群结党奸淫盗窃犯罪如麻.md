Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 20th: The Japanese magazine "Truth Special Report" in its August issue reported that the "Afei" (hoodlum) problem in Japan is becoming increasingly serious, with the number of juvenile delinquents reaching an alarming level.

The magazine wrote: The Japanese National Police Agency released statistics on the criminal records of "Afei," stating that last year alone, a total of 140,884 delinquent youths under the age of nineteen were sent to the Police Agency for "guidance" due to criminal behavior. Even more frightening is that, within this number, 11,127 were children under the age of eleven.

These "Afei" receiving "guidance" engaged in a range of misconduct, including truancy, idleness, smoking, drinking, running away from home, stealing money, making bad friends, pimping, rape, or associating with immoral members of the opposite sex, fighting, and so on.

The Japanese police authorities' statistics also revealed the fact that 80% of these male and female "Afei" come from middle-class or higher family backgrounds. In April of this year, a shocking sex scandal occurred in Tokyo involving four female "Afei" aged between thirteen and nineteen, who were sisters from a landlord family.

"Truth Special Report" said that the "Afei," known as the "Sun Tribe" by the Japanese, have recently formed new organizations. There are many emerging "Afei" organizations, and those already discovered by the police authorities include the "Mole Tribe Club," the "Shimokitazawa Club," and the "Rumor Board Club," among others. These clubs are even more obscene than the "Sun Tribe." The "Mole Tribe Club" is an organization of female "Afei," and the leader is a seventeen-year-old girl.

　　日本阿飞成群结党奸淫盗窃犯罪如麻
    据新华社20日讯　东京消息：日本8月号的“实话特报”杂志报道，日本的阿飞问题日益严重，少年犯罪人数达到惊人的程度。
    这家杂志写道：日本警察厅发表阿飞们犯罪纪录的统计说：去年一年中，因犯罪而被发交警察厅接受“辅导”的不良少年，在十九岁以内的共有十四万零八百八十四人之多。更可怕的是，在这个数目中，有一万一千一百二十七人是未满十一岁的孩子。
    这些接受“辅导”的阿飞们的不良行为，包括了怠学怠业、抽烟饮酒、离家在外流浪、偷钱外出、结交坏朋友、轧姘头强奸、或与不良的异性交游、打架、……等等。
    日本警察当局的统计还暴露了这样一个事实：在这些犯罪的阿飞男女中，80％的家庭环境都是中等以上的阶级。今年4月，东京曾经发生了一桩令人吃惊的桃色纠纷案件，案中的四个年龄在十三岁到十九岁之间的女阿飞是一个地主家庭中的同胞姊妹。
      “实话特报”说，被日本人称为“太阳族”的阿飞们最近又有了新兴的组织。新兴的阿飞组织有好多伙，已经被警察当局查获的就有“地鼠族俱乐部”、“下北泽俱乐部”、“传言板俱乐部”等等。这些俱乐部比“太阳族”更加猥秽。“地鼠族俱乐部”是个女阿飞的组织，首领是个十七岁的女孩子。
