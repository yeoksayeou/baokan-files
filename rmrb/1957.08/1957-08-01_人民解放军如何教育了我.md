    How the People's Liberation Army Educated Me
    Chen Yi
    Today is the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, a glorious and great commemorative festival for the Chinese people. To commemorate this glorious festival, I think of the communist education I have received in the army over the past thirty years, which has been very profound. I am an intellectual, and the benefits I have received in the army over the decades can only be described roughly with the eight characters: "get rid of the old and establish the new, be reborn." This aspect should be dissected in a long article to commemorate the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Unfortunately, my health does not permit me to do so. However, I still want to take this opportunity to solemnly introduce that from the beginning of the army's construction, the Party used communism to educate all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Army. This fact is the most fundamental and important key to our army's construction and the source of the great combat power of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Only based on this point can we understand the past, present, and future of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.
    The Party and the army educated us with communism, enabling us to gradually understand and grasp the laws of social development, know the direction of social development in the world and China, and make us determined to be revolutionaries and revolutionary soldiers, not to be reactionaries, and to resolutely fight against reactionaries.
    The Party and the army educated us with communism, making us understand that serving the people is the greatest happiness and supreme glory in life. Therefore, it also enables us to hate exploiters and oppressors from our class instincts and regard exploitation and oppression as the greatest sins and ugliness. Therefore, in the army's education work, it is required to develop good habits of cherishing the people and respecting the people's interests, requiring the army to have strict discipline and a mass viewpoint, and requiring understanding how to use the mass line when carrying out work. Such a people's army, placed anywhere, is distinguished from all old armies by its extremely distinct revolutionary political color.
    The Party and the army educated us with communism, making us deeply aware that the bad traditions of Chinese warlordism must be resolutely eradicated. As everyone knows, the characteristic of warlordism is to emphasize that military affairs are above all else, and the army is above all else. Warlords use military power to monopolize politics and the economy, harming the country and the people, and doing whatever they want. Within the army, the authority of officers is emphasized, and they regard themselves as sacred and inviolable. The higher the military rank, the greater the authority. Ordinary people and soldiers are trampled on like ants, and are not allowed to utter a sound. In the army, in response to this bad and shameful situation in the old society, the Party put forward the slogan of opposing warlordism and various political measures in the People's Liberation Army, thus fundamentally eliminating the face and shadow of the old army, so that warlordism could not be transplanted into our People's Army.
    The Party and the army educated us with communism, making us understand that to be a revolutionary soldier and a revolutionary, we must constantly study, absorb all kinds of useful knowledge, and understand and not refuse to adopt various organizational forms, various propaganda methods, and various combat methods suitable for the interests of the revolution. It makes us understand that adhering to a fixed revolutionary method and combat form will inevitably fail to cope with the ever-changing revolutionary situation. Using the communist, realistic, and scientific spirit to deal with military issues is one of the greatest characteristics of the People's Liberation Army's construction project, which could never be dreamed of in the old army.
    From 1927 to 1929, during these three years, that is, the early stage of the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, Comrade Mao Zedong personally led the Fourth Red Army to make political creations and accumulate experience in building the army. This is one of the best models for the Chinese People's Liberation Army's army-building work. The literature of this period is full of examples of using Marxism-Leninism to solve Chinese military problems and full of examples of educating the army with a communist worldview. I believe that the Chinese People's Liberation Army has now become an invincible and powerful self-defense force. However, when drinking water, one must remember the source. The political principles of army building were, are, and will continue to be based on the communist worldview as the foundation for educating the army. This is unchangeable. I hope that all comrades of the Chinese People's Liberation Army will strengthen their studies on this basic key point.
    I will use the above words as my dedication to the great Army Day festival and thank the Party and the army for educating me with a communist worldview in the long struggle.

    人民解放军如何教育了我
    陈毅
    今日，是中国人民解放军建军的三十周年，这是中国人民的一个光荣而伟大的纪念节日。为了纪念这一光荣的节日，我想到三十年来我自己在部队中所受到的共产主义教育，真是十分深刻。我是一个知识分子，几十年来在部队中所受的教益只有用革故鼎新脱胎换骨八个字约略可以形容。这方面应该用一篇长文章作自己解剖，以纪念中国人民解放军。无奈，我的健康状况不许可我如此作。然而我仍就要趁此机会郑重介绍。党在建军开始之日起，就是用共产主义来教育中国人民军队的全体指挥员和战斗员，这一事实，是我军建设上最根本和最重要的关键，这是中国人民解放军的伟大战斗力的源泉。只有根据这一点，才能认识中国人民解放军的过去、现在和未来。
    党与部队用共产主义来教育我们，使我们逐渐认识和掌握社会发展规律，知道世界和中国的社会发展方向，使我们肯定的作革命家和革命军人，不去作反动派，并且要坚决与反动派作战。
    党与部队用共产主义来教育我们，使我们懂得为人民服务是人生最大快乐和无上光荣，因而也使我们能从阶级本能上憎恨剥削者和压迫者，而以剥削、压迫为最大的罪恶和丑行。因此，在部队教育工作上就要求养成爱护人民尊重人民利益的良好习惯，要求部队有严明的纪律和群众观点，要求进行工作时懂得运用群众工作路线，这样一支人民军队，摆在任何地方都以极鲜明的革命的政治色彩与一切旧军队区别开来。
    党与部队用共产主义教育我们，使我们深深知道中国的军阀主义的恶劣传统必须坚决根除。如众所周知，军阀主义的特点是强调军事高于一切，军队高于一切，军阀们用军事力量垄断政治、经济，祸国殃民，任所欲为。在军队内部养成军官权威独重，自视为神圣不可侵犯，军阶愈高，权威愈大，老百姓和小兵们被践踏的如蚂蚁一样，不准哼吓一声。党在部队中针对这一恶劣的可耻的旧社会的情况，在人民解放军中提出反对军阀主义口号和各项政治步骤，这样把旧军队的面貌和影子就从根本上铲除，使军阀主义不能移植到我们的人民军队中来。
    党与部队用共产主义来教育我们，使我们懂得要作一个革命军人同时又是一个革命家，必须不断学习，吸收各种有益知识，懂得和不拒绝采取适合革命利益的各种组织形式、各种宣传方式和各种战斗方式。使我们懂得坚持一种固定的革命方式和战斗形式，必不能应付变化多端的革命局势。用共产主义的实事求是的科学精神来处理军事问题，是中国人民解放军建军工程上的最大特点之一，这是在旧军队中永远不能梦见的。
    1927年到1929年，这三年中间，即第二次国内革命战争初期，毛泽东同志亲自统率红军第四军，作建军的政治创造与经验积累，这是中国人民解放军建军工作的最好的典范之一。这一时期的文献充满了运用马克思列宁主义解决中国军事问题的例证，充满了以共产主义的世界观教育部队的例证。我认为中国人民解放军，现在已成为战无不胜的强大的自卫力量，然而饮水思源，建军的政治原则，过去是，现在是，将来仍然应该是以共产主义世界观为教育部队的基本，这是不可改变的。我愿中国人民解放军的全体同志在这一基本关键上加强自己的学习。
    我就用上面的话，作为我对伟大的建军节日的献词，并感谢党与部队在长期斗争中用共产主义世界观教育了我。
