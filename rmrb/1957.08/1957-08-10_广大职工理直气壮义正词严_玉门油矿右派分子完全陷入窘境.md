The anti-Rightist struggle at the Yumen Oil Mine began on July 18th, and since then, the broad masses of workers and their families have actively participated in this great struggle.

After the rectification campaign began, the Rightists launched a frenzied attack on the Party. The Rightist Zhang Yintang (technician) completely denied the existence of classes, saying that in the old society, "workers received certain wages and benefits for working in factories; farmers willingly gave landlords grain for cultivating land." Classes and class contradictions were "all created by the Communist Party." The contradiction between the Chinese people and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group was not an antagonistic contradiction, and now calling Chiang Kai-shek an enemy is merely a case of "the winner is king, the loser is a bandit." He also said that "the American system is better than the current system in New China," and the Kuomintang "had clear laws and distinct right and wrong." The Rightist Kou Zhusan (planner) was overjoyed when he saw Ge Peiqi's speech, and cheered loudly.

After these reactionary remarks of the Rightists were exposed, they aroused great anger among the broad masses of workers at the Yumen Oil Mine. More than 250 workers immediately raised questions, asking them why they were lying with their eyes open. The Drilling Company, the Yumen Oil Mine Office of the Petroleum Company, the entire mine's Communist Youth League members, the Mine Trade Union, and the Brick Factory successively held meetings ranging from over a hundred people to over ten thousand people to oppose these anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks. Many workers from rural areas cited facts to refute the fallacy that classes did not exist. In the old society, peasants were forced to sell their sons and daughters, their wives were separated from them, and their families were ruined because they could not pay rent. Was this mutually voluntary? Many elderly workers denounced the crimes of the old society, exposing the lie that the Kuomintang's laws were clear and right and wrong were distinct. They said that before liberation, the Yumen Oil Mine's worker cafeteria was like a horse pen. Many workers wore only one old sheepskin all year round, "wearing it during the day, covering it at night, and turning the fur outwards when it rained." Workers who got sick, regardless of how many patients there were or what kind of illness they had, were placed in one room, and almost every day people were tortured to death. The dead were thrown to the eastern mountain. Was this also mutually voluntary?

Under the masses' stern questioning, Zhang Yintang and Kou Zhusan were completely speechless and unable to answer.

### 广大职工理直气壮义正词严  玉门油矿右派分子完全陷入窘境

    广大职工理直气壮义正词严
    玉门油矿右派分子完全陷入窘境
    本报讯　玉门油矿反右派斗争从7月18日开始后，广大职工和家属纷纷投入这一伟大斗争中。
    整风开始后，右派分子向党展开疯狂进攻。右派分子张印堂（技术员）根本否认阶级的存在，说在旧社会“工人在工厂做工有一定的工资待遇；农民种地给地主交点粮食都是互相情愿的”。阶级、阶级矛盾，“都是共产党制造出来的”。中国人民和蒋介石反动集团不是敌我矛盾，现在把蒋介石说成敌人，只不过是“胜者王侯败者贼”。他又说“美国的制度比新中国现行的制度要好些”，国民党“法律严明，是非分明”。右派分子寇祝三（计划员）在看到葛佩琦的发言后，兴高彩烈，高声喝彩。
    右派分子的这些反动言论被揭露后，激起玉门油矿广大职工的极大愤怒，二百五十多名职工立即提出质问，问他们为什么睁着眼说瞎话。钻井公司、石油公司玉门油矿办事处、全矿共青团员、矿工会、制砖厂等陆续举行一百多人到一万多人的大会反对这种反党反社会主义的言论。许多来自农村的工人列举事实斥责阶级不存在的谬论。在旧社会里，农民由于交不起地租，被迫卖儿卖女、妻离子散、家破人亡，难道这是互相情愿吗？许多年老的工人控诉旧社会的罪恶，揭穿国民党法律严明是非分明的谎言。他们说解放前，玉门油矿的工人食堂像马圈一样。许多工人一年只穿一件老羊皮，“白天穿，晚间盖，天下雨，毛朝外。”工人生了病，不管病人多少、不管什么病，都放在一个房子，被折磨致死的几乎每天都有，死了扔到东山，难道这也是两相情愿吗？
    在群众的严词质问下，张印堂、寇祝三完全理屈词穷无言以对。
