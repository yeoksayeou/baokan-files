Zhang Naiqi's Confidant - Yuan Muru

The State Taxation Bureau of the Ministry of Finance has recently held a series of meetings to expose and criticize the ugly face of the rightist Yuan Muru, deputy secretary of the Ministry of Finance branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association (CDNCA) and section chief of the State Taxation Bureau, for his anti-communist and anti-socialist activities.

Yuan Muru was a confidant of Zhang Naiqi. In 1926, taking advantage of the revolutionary upsurge, he once went to Jinggang Mountain, but eventually couldn't withstand the arduous revolutionary life and became a "deserter" from the revolutionary ranks. When Zhang Naiqi was in Anhui using his position as the head of the puppet finance department to establish his influence, he joined Zhang's camp and became Zhang's confidant. At the time of liberation, he was a section chief in the puppet finance department of Gansu Province, but he was unwilling to be retained by the local people's government. In early 1950, he brought Chen Shaoen (who has already been arrested), a counter-revolutionary with blood debts, to seek refuge with his benefactor Zhang Naiqi, who introduced him to the Ministry of Finance and assigned him to work in the State Taxation Bureau. For seven or eight years, Yuan Muru often visited his benefactor, and they confided many unspeakable secrets to each other.

According to Yuan Muru's preliminary confession, Zhang Naiqi had sold him a lot of his private ideas. Zhang had insulted revolutionary leaders as "idols," slandered "Communists as dogmatic," and denounced the United Front Work Department as "bureaucratic, supporting the sectarian activities of the CDNCA." He attacked the people's tax policies, tried his best to speak for the capitalists, saying that tax revenue "does not take into account the actual difficulties of industrialists and businessmen," and even slandered that the materials of the "Five-Anti Campaign" were not true. He said in an extremely cunning way: "If it is true, then it proves that the government's policy of educating and reforming industrialists and businessmen has failed." He was particularly dissatisfied with the democratic parties accepting the leadership of the Communist Party, saying that "only by standing on an equal footing can mutual supervision be implemented." Otherwise, "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" can only "be empty words." Zhang Naiqi also asked Yuan Muru to follow his example, "don't be superstitious about the Communist Party," "think independently," "dare to say what you want to say, don't be afraid of making mistakes, and be bold in handling your work."

As expected, Yuan Muru lived up to the teachings of his master. As soon as the rectification campaign began, he vigorously engaged in activities within the organization under the guise of helping the Party rectify its work. Echoing the words of Zhang Naiqi, Chu Anping, Ma Zhemin, and Chen Xingui, he spread poison and ignited fires from the aspects of the Party's united front policy, tax system, personnel system, and cadre policy, and launched a frenzied attack on the socialist system and the Party's leadership. He actively supported Chu Anping's fallacy of "the Party's world." He also distorted the facts and slandered the Party's united front work as "uniting the upper but not the lower, uniting the old but not the young, uniting the left but not the right, all are formalities." He cursed that "the relationship between upper-level democratic figures and the Party is a master-guest relationship (referring to the Party), and the relationship between lower-level democratic figures and the Party is a master-servant relationship (referring to the Party)." Like his "benefactor," he believed that it was "too pitiful" for the democratic parties to accept the leadership of the Party, and declared that the "walls" and "trenches" were "created by the Communist Party, and the democratic parties have no responsibility." He wanted to incite everyone to "struggle" against the Party, clamoring to establish a "inspection team with the participation of democratic parties" to "inspect all the issues raised in the rectification movement," in an attempt to use this to squeeze out the Party's leadership in the organization.

He viciously attacked personnel work as "there is nothing wrong in the world, but mediocre people disturb themselves," and slandered that "the problems are all caused by the personnel department." He distorted the cadres who were transferred to the northwest to support national construction as "exiles," and also said that "non-Party members are transferred away, and their original positions cannot be guaranteed." He loudly called for "shrinking" or sending "democratic figures to participate in the personnel department." He cursed that Communist Party members "do not serve the people, but the people serve the Communist Party members."

Yuan Muru greatly admired his "benefactor" Zhang Naiqi, repeatedly praised Zhang for having "unique insights," and regardless of the facts, peddled Zhang's "private ideas," distorted the tax system. When Zhang Naiqi's anti-communist and anti-socialist fallacies were criticized, he fabricated facts and portrayed Zhang as a figure who truly represented the interests of industrialists and businessmen.

This rightist also made a wrong estimate of the relationship between the people and the Party, believing that the Party had lost the hearts of the people, saying that "if there is any change, I am afraid that the masses will not support the Communist Party as they did before." Therefore, during the great blooming and contending, he was "very excited and agitated, and could not calm down to listen to reports, work, or study." He single-mindedly spread poison and ignited fires everywhere, trying to incite the masses' dissatisfaction with the Party, so as to "expand his influence."

However, Yuan Muru miscalculated. The masses had long seen through his tricks. In the face of ironclad facts, he had to admit his crimes, saying that Zhang Naiqi had "poisoned him deeply." At present, all cadres of the State Taxation Bureau of the Ministry of Finance are pursuing this rightist. (Zhu Fulin, Wang Wending)

　　章乃器的亲信——袁穆如
    财政部税务总局在最近连续举行会议，揭露和批判民建会财政部支部副主任委员、税务总局科长右派分子袁穆如的反共、反社会主义的丑恶面貌。
    袁穆如是章乃器的亲信。他在1926年趁着革命高潮曾一度上了井岗山，终因经不住艰苦的革命生活的锻炼，就当了革命队伍的“逃兵”。当章乃器在安徽利用伪财政厅长职位树立羽翼的时候，他投到章的门下，成为章的亲信。解放时，他在甘肃伪财政厅任科长，但不愿受当地人民政府的留用，于1950年初，竟然携带了一个有血债的反革命分子陈绍恩（已逮捕）来投奔他的恩师章乃器，由章乃器介绍到财政部分配税务总局工作。七、八年来，袁穆如常常要去看望他的恩师，他们互相倾吐了不少不可告人的私话。
    仅就袁穆如的初步交代，章乃器曾对他贩卖了不少私货。章曾辱骂革命领袖是“偶像”，诬蔑“共产党员是教条主义”，统战部是“官僚主义，支持民建的宗派活动”，攻击人民税务政策，竭力为资本家叫屈，说什么税收“不照顾工商业者的实际困难”，还诽谤“五反”的材料不真实，极其刁钻的说：“倘若是事实，那就证明政府对工商业者教育改造的政策是失败了”。对民主党派接受共产党的领导尤为不满，说什么“只有站在平等地位才能实行互相监督”。否则，“长期共存，互相监督”只能“是句空话”。章乃器还要袁穆如效法他，“不要迷信共产党”，“要独立思考”，“敢于说自己想说的话，不要怕犯错误，要大胆处理工作”。
    袁穆如果然不负乃师的教导，整风一开始，他就在机关内借帮助党整风为名大肆活动，并与章乃器、储安平、马哲民、陈新桂之流的言论相呼应，从党的统战政策、税收制度、人事制度、干部政策等方面放毒、点火，向社会主义制度和党的领导权猖狂进攻。他积极支持储安平“党天下”的谬论。并歪曲事实诽谤党的统战工作是“统上不统下，统老不统少，统左不统右，都是形式”。骂“上层民主人士与党的关系是主（指党）宾关系，下层民主人士与党是主（指党）仆关系”。和他的“恩师”一样，认为民主党派接受党的领导“太可怜”，宣称“墙”和“沟”是“共产党造成的，民主党派没有责任”。想挑起大家向党“斗争”，叫嚣要成立什么“有民主党派参加的检查组”，“检查整风运动中提出的一切问题”。妄图借此在机关中排挤党的领导。
    他恶毒地攻击人事工作是“天下本无事，庸人自扰之”，诬蔑说“问题都是人事部门搞出来的”，把调往西北支援国家建设的干部歪曲为“充军”，还说什么“非党人士调走，原职保不住”。大声疾呼地要“缩小”或者派“民主人士参加人事部门”。骂共产党员“不是为人民服务，而是人民为共产党员服务”。
    袁穆如对他的“恩师”章乃器推崇备至，一再赞扬章有“独到之处”，不顾事实地贩卖章的“私货”，歪曲税收制度，当章乃器的反共、反社会主义谬论受到批驳时，还虚构事实，把章说成真正代表工商业者说话的人物。
    这个右派分子还对人民和党的关系作了错误的估计，认为党已失去人心，说什么“如果有一个什么变动，恐怕群众就不会像从前那样拥护共产党了”。因而，在大鸣大放中他“很兴奋，很激动，连听报告、工作和学习都安不下心”。他专心一意地到处放毒、点火，企图挑逗起群众对党的不满，从而“扩大他的影响”。
    但是，袁穆如失算了，群众早就识破了他的把戏，在铁的事实面前，他不得不承认自己的罪行，说出章乃器使他“中毒很深”。目前财政部税务总局全体干部正向这个右派分子进行追击。（朱福林、王文鼎）
