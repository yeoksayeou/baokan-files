Nanhe County, Hebei Province, Explains Principles Thoroughly at Every Level
Great Debate Reverses Sluggish Procurement Situation

(Our Newspaper) According to the Hebei Daily: During this year's summer grain procurement work, Nanhe County, Hebei Province, launched a socialist great debate among the peasants, targeting the individualistic thinking of some peasants who only cared about their personal interests and disregarded the interests of the state, as well as the right-leaning sentiments and coercive commandism of many cadres. This debate quickly reversed the sluggish summer grain procurement work and smoothly completed the procurement task. By mid-July, the county had procured and stored more than 13.2 million jin of wheat.

Unifying the Ideological Understanding of Basic-Level Cadres
Launching Propaganda and Education Work Among the Masses

When the wheat procurement task was announced, many people showed resistance. They believed that "the state purchases too much, and the consumption quotas left for us are too small." At this time, some landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries took the opportunity to provoke and incite, saying things like "The state has the right to purchase our grain, and we have the right not to produce"; "The state wants to purchase more, so we will conceal more." Cadres and people who supported the policy of unified purchase and sale were ridiculed and attacked. For a time, evil trends in the countryside rose, and righteousness could not prevail, so the grain procurement work lagged far behind.

Faced with this ideological confusion, the Party's basic-level organizations and cadres showed three different attitudes. Some believed that the state was indeed purchasing too much and leaving too little for the people, and felt that they had no reason to persuade the people. They even sympathized with the masses' wrong actions such as concealing and privately dividing grain, showing serious right-leaning sentiments. In contrast, some Party basic-level organizations and cadres believed that the masses' opinions were all wrong and were unwilling to carry out ideological education work, thinking that they had to be tough to complete the procurement task. In addition to the above two "leftist" and rightist attitudes, the Party's basic-level organizations and cadres in Yanli, Sansi, Sanzhao, Shizhao and other villages adopted the correct attitude. They deeply understood and analyzed the ideological sentiments of the masses, carried out positive education for the masses, and started debates until the rights and wrongs were clarified.

The Nanhe County Party Committee summarized the above three attitudes and practices, and mobilized cadres to discuss them. After discussion, the cadres' understanding was unified. Everyone realized that actively strengthening political and ideological work was the most correct path. Therefore, the county decided to carry out extensive and in-depth socialist ideological education during the summer procurement work. Starting in mid-June, the county organized a total of 46 responsible cadres and reporters at all levels to give 237 reports to more than 70% of the county's population. The county also trained 16,012 Party members, League members, and propagandists to carry out propaganda and education work among the masses. Various villages and communes held different types of discussion meetings and debate meetings. Through the great debate, the county's political outlook greatly changed. The complaints about grain procurement work among the masses were greatly reduced. The subversive and inciting words and deeds of bad elements were attacked. Over ten days, more than ten million jin of summer grain were procured and stored.

Recalling and Comparing Life in the Old and New Societies
Calculating the Detailed Accounts of Unified Purchase and Sale

When carrying out political and ideological education work, the first step in all locations was for cadres and masses to fully explain the reasons together. The main point was to discuss the benefits of the state's policy of unified purchase and sale. Cadres and farmers in Sanzhao township conducted recollection and comparison. They compared the situation after the disasters in 1943 and 1956. They thought of the miserable life of 1943, when there was nothing to eat or wear, grain and commodity prices soared, children were sold, and people fled famine, while in 1956, life was stable after the disaster, and winter wheat had a bumper harvest. After comparison, everyone realized that without cooperation and without unified purchase and sale, last year's disaster could not have been overcome. Yanli township mobilized the masses to calculate several accounts. From last autumn to before the wheat harvest, the state supplied more than 2.29 million jin of grain to the whole township, and this year only 527,000 jin were purchased; at the same time, the state also issued various loans and relief funds of more than 150,000 yuan. This summer's total wheat output was 2.863 million jin. After purchasing 1.109 million jin, the township still retained more than 1.7 million jin of grain. Because the accounts were cleared up, everyone realized the benefits of unified purchase and sale, and the township quickly completed the procurement task.

Procurement Figures Are Not Larger Than in the Past
Grain Retention Standards Cannot Be Considered Low Either

After preliminarily clarifying the basic issues of unified purchase and sale, the second step was to clarify the ambiguous thinking of the masses and clarify the rights and wrongs through debate. For example, some people thought that "unified purchase and sale is good, but the state purchases too much." They did not understand the importance of the state controlling the necessary amount of grain. Sansi township launched a debate on this issue. Someone said: "The state's procurement figures are not more than in the past, we are just red-eyed when we see the state taking it away." Xue Xiaode, a member of the Sansi Agricultural Cooperative, said: "In recent years, only last year's procurement was less. Because of this, grain ran into the hands of private merchants and peddlers, and our village alone used thousands of jin of wheat to sell noodles. Therefore, in the spring, some real grain-deficient households suffered from grain shortages, causing a lot of trouble for the state and the masses. It seems that it is better to have the grain in the hands of the state." For example, some people thought that the grain retention quota was low. This issue was discussed in Chengguan township. A poor peasant said: In the past, landlords, rich peasants, and well-to-do middle peasants had more grain, while lower-middle peasants and poor peasants generally could not eat from wheat harvest to autumn harvest. Now that we are keeping this much, I think life is much better than it was then. Some people in Sansi village said: "Eating and clothing depend on the family property. How much grain we keep depends on the foundation of our country. Everyone wants to keep more, but we also have to look at the country's difficulties. If we want to keep more grain, we have to produce more."

Concealing Production is Detrimental to Both the State and Oneself
Only Developing Production Can Allow for More Retention and Distribution

After clarifying the above ambiguous ideas, the farmers criticized the wrong practice of concealing production. They realized that concealing production is not only detrimental to the state but also to themselves. If the output is not reported truthfully, the principle of distribution according to work cannot be correctly implemented, and concealing production only benefits a few people while most people suffer. In particular, members who work well and have many work points are even more worried that concealing production will make them suffer. After clarifying this right and wrong, many cadres and masses automatically revealed many facts about concealing production. According to incomplete statistics from six villages including Haoqiao, Songzhuang, and Sansi, more than 160,000 jin of concealed production were exposed.

After explaining the principles thoroughly and clarifying the rights and wrongs, all townships in the county organized the masses to complete the delivery tasks on the one hand, and pointed out the correct way to resolve the contradiction between the needs of the state and the demands of farmers to retain and distribute more grain on the other: If we want to retain and distribute more, we can only develop production. When discussing this issue, all locations refuted the wrong ideas of complaining about the state and cadres. Many people realized that the fact that we are distributing less now is not the fault of the state, nor the fault of the cadres, but the fault of producing less. Now, the enthusiasm of the county's farmers for production is high, and all villages and communes have formulated production plans and launched production competitions to win red flags. The farmers proposed: "Strive for a bumper harvest in the autumn, both to complete the state procurement tasks and to produce more and distribute more grain."

### 河北南和县层层深入讲透道理  大辩论扭转征购滞缓局面

    河北南和县层层深入讲透道理
    大辩论扭转征购滞缓局面
    本报讯　据河北日报消息：在今年夏季征购工作中，河北省南和县针对有些农民只顾个人利益不顾国家利益的个人主义思想和不少干部的右倾情绪和强迫命令的作风，发动农民进行了一次社会主义大辩论。这次辩论迅速扭转了夏季征购工作迟迟不前的局面，顺利地完成了征购任务。到7月中旬，全县征购入库的小麦即达一千三百二十多万斤。
    统一基层干部的思想认识
    向群众展开宣传教育工作
    当小麦征购任务公布以后，不少群众有抵触情绪。他们认为“国家统购太多了，留的消费指标太少了”。这时候，一些地主、富农和反革命分子，乘机进行挑拨和煽动，说什么“国家有权购咱的粮食，咱就有权不生产”；“国家想多购，咱就多瞒产”。拥护统购统销政策的干部和群众，竟受到讽刺和打击。一时农村中邪气上升，正气不能抬头，粮食征购工作迟迟不前。
    面对这种思想混乱的情况，党的基层组织和干部，表现了三种不同的态度。有的认为国家就是购的多，给群众留的少了，感到自己没有什么道理去说服群众。他们甚至同情群众瞒产、私分等错误行动，表现了严重的右倾情绪。与此相反，有些党的基层组织和干部，认为群众的意见都是错误的，不愿进行思想教育工作，以为要完成征购任务就得硬来。除以上两种“左”的和右的态度以外，阎里、三思、三召、史召等乡的党的基层组织和干部采取了正确的态度。他们深入了解和分析群众的思想情绪，向群众进行了正面教育，展开争辩，最后弄清了是非。
    南和县委总结了以上三种态度和作法，并发动干部进行讨论。经过讨论，干部们的认识统一了。大家认识到只有积极地加强政治思想工作才是最正确的道路。因此，全县决定在夏季征购工作中，开展一次广泛深入的社会主义思想教育。从6月中旬开始，全县共计组织各级负责干部和报告员四十六人，向全县70％以上的人口作了二百三十七次报告。全县并训练了党员、团员、宣传员一万六千零十二人，向群众开展了宣传教育工作。各乡、各社召开了不同类型的座谈会、辩论会。通过大辩论，全县政治面貌大为改观。群众中对粮食征购工作的不满言论大大减少了。坏分子的挑拨煽动言行受到了打击。十多天中征购入库的夏粮即达一千多万斤。
    回忆对比新旧社会的生活
    算清统购统销的几笔细账
    各地在开展政治思想教育工作时，第一步是干部和群众一起充分地讲道理。主要是讨论国家的统购统销政策的好处。三召乡的干部和农民进行了回忆和对比。他们对比了1943年和1956年受灾后的情形。他们想到1943年无吃无穿、粮价物价飞涨、卖儿卖女、逃荒在外的悲惨生活，而1956年灾后生活安定，冬小麦获得了大丰收。经过对比，大家都认识到了如果没有合作化、没有统购统销，去年的灾荒是无法度过的。阎里乡发动群众算清了几笔账。从去年秋天到麦收前，国家供应了全乡二百二十九万多斤粮食，今年只统购了五十二万七千斤；同时国家还发放了各种贷款和救济款十五万多元。今年夏季小麦总产量是二百八十六万三千斤，除征购一百一十万零九千斤外，全乡还留粮一百七十多万斤。由于算清了账，大家认识到统购统销的好处，全乡很快完成了征购任务。
    统购数字不比过去大
    留粮标准也不能说低
    对统购统销的基本问题初步辩明以后，各地第二步是通过辩论澄清群众中的模糊思想，弄清是非。例如，有些群众认为“统购统销好是好，就是购的多”。他们不了解国家掌握必要数量粮食的重要意义。三思乡针对这个问题展开了争论。有人说：“国家征购的数字比过去并不多，咱们是光看见国家拿走就红眼。”三思农业社社员薛小得说：“几年来就是去年征购的少一点。正因为如此，粮食才跑到私商小贩手里，光咱村卖挂面就用了几千斤小麦。因此到了春天，一些真正的缺粮户闹粮食紧张，给国家和群众造成了不少困难。看来还是粮食掌握在国家手里好。”又如有些人认为留粮指标低。这个问题在城关乡展开了讨论。一个贫农说：过去粮食多的是地主、富农和富裕中农，下中农和贫农一般从麦收吃不到秋收。现在留这些，我觉得比那时生活好多了。三思村有的群众说：“吃饭穿衣论家当，咱们留粮多少，得看咱们国家的底子。大家都想多留点，可也得看看国家的困难。想多留粮，非得多生产不行。”
    瞒产对国家和自己都不利
    要多留多分只有发展生产
    澄清了上面的模糊思想以后，农民们批判了隐瞒产量的错误做法。他们认识到瞒产不仅对国家不利，对自己也不利。产量报不实就不能正确地实现按劳取酬的原则，瞒产只是少数人沾光，多数人吃亏。特别是劳动好工分多的社员更担心瞒产使自己吃亏。弄清这个是非后，许多干部和群众自动地揭露出许多瞒产的事实。据郝桥、宋庄、三思等六个村不完全统计，即揭发瞒产十六万多斤。
    讲透道理和弄清是非以后，全县各乡一面组织群众完成交售任务，一面向群众指明解决国家需要和农民要求多留多分之间的矛盾的正确途径：要想多留多分，只有发展生产。各地在讨论这个问题时，批驳了埋怨国家和干部的错误思想。许多人认识到：现在分的少，一不怨国家，二不怨干部，就怨生产的少。现在，全县农民生产情绪高涨，各乡、社都制定了生产计划，开展了夺红旗的生产竞赛。农民们提出：“争取秋季大丰收，既要完成国家征购任务，又要多生产、多分粮。”
