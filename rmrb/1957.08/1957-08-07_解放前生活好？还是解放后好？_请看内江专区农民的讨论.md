Is Life Before Liberation Good? Or Life After Liberation Good?
Please see the discussion of peasants in Neijiang Prefecture

Our Chengdu correspondent reported on the 4th: In early July, Neijiang Prefecture, Sichuan, universally launched a socialist propaganda and education campaign. Various localities, combined with their local conditions, adopted the method of recollection and comparison, and debated among the peasants whether socialism is good or capitalism is good, whether life before liberation was good or life after liberation was good, and other issues. Through debate, righteousness in the countryside rose, and evil declined.

The Shunjiang Agricultural Cooperative in Shidong Township, Neijiang County, used the changes in the lives of fifty cooperative members before and after liberation to conduct comparative education for the peasants. These fifty cooperative members used to live like cattle and horses. Twenty-one of them had no home; twenty lacked food and clothing; nine barely maintained their lives by owing rent and pawns. The situation completely changed after liberation. Now, twenty-five have risen to become upper-middle peasants, twenty-one have become lower-middle peasants, and only four are poor peasants. They have food and clothing, and have generally established families. Some have even been elected as model workers and people's representatives. Their vivid facts of being emancipated crushed the so-called slanders that the Communist Party's leadership is not good, that cooperation is not good, and so on.

The rich peasant Zhong Shanggui from the Wuxing Second Cooperative in Anquan Township, Renshou County, slandered that the peasants joining the cooperative means “good sun, good fatigue, and good hunger,” attempting to incite some cooperative members to withdraw from the cooperative. The cooperative members held a meeting to expose his sabotage activities. Zhang Tianhe, a cooperative member who rose from a poor peasant to an upper-middle peasant, said that in the past, peasants could not eat two or three hundred catties of grain a year. The tragic situation of eating only one meal a day and selling children was very common. Now, this situation no longer exists. In the past eight years, no one has starved to death in the whole township. My family now has unconsumed old grain, and new grain has been distributed. Isn't this better than the days of crying to heaven with no way out in the past?

Through propaganda, the class consciousness of cadres and the masses has been improved. The reactionary arrogance has been hit. Zhang Basan, a newly rich peasant in Fuxi Township, Neijiang County, exploited hired laborers, engaged in speculation and profiteering, resisted unified purchase and sales, and incited peasants to withdraw from the cooperative. In the past, some peasants were deceived. After propaganda and education work, many peasants recognized Zhang Basan's vicious intentions. Yao Zhanghai and other nine households who wanted to withdraw from the cooperative are now determined not to withdraw.

### 解放前生活好？还是解放后好？  请看内江专区农民的讨论

    解放前生活好？还是解放后好？
    请看内江专区农民的讨论
    本报成都4日电　7月初，四川内江专区普遍展开社会主义宣传教育运动。各地结合当地实际情况，采用回忆对比的方法，在农民中辩论社会主义好还是资本主义好，解放前好还是解放后好等问题。经过辩论，农村正气上升，邪气下降。
    内江县史东乡顺江农业社，用五十个社员解放前后生活变化情况，向农民进行了对比教育。这五十个社员过去生活如牛马，无家无室的二十一人；缺吃少穿的二十人；欠租欠押勉强维持生活的九人。解放后情况完全变了。现在上升为上中农的二十五人、下中农的二十一人，贫农只有四人。他们有吃有穿，已经普遍成家立业。有的还当选为劳动模范和人民代表。他们翻身的活生生的事实，粉碎了所谓共产党领导不好、合作化不好等等谰言。
    仁寿县安全乡五星二社富农钟尚贵，诬蔑农民入了社是“晒得好、累得好、饿得好”，企图煽动部分社员退社。社员们开会揭发了他的破坏活动。从贫农上升为上中农的社员张天和说，过去农民每年吃不到二、三百斤粮食。一天吃一顿饭和卖儿卖女的悲惨情况很普遍。现在，这种情况没有了，八年来全乡没饿死一个人。我家现在陈谷子没吃完新谷子又分了。这难道不比过去哭天无路的日子好吗？
    经过宣传，干部和群众的阶级觉悟提高了。反动气焰受到了打击。内江县富溪乡新富农张八三，剥削雇工，投机倒把，抗拒统购统销，并煽动农民退社。过去有些农民被蒙蔽，经过宣传教育工作，许多农民认清了张八三的恶毒用意。尧章海等九户要退社的现在都坚决不退了。
