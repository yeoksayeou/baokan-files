　　Peeling Away Layers of False Pretenses, Breaking Through Lines of Defense
　　Sternly and Justly Refuting Wang Zaoshi
　  Shanghai People's Representatives Engaged in Fierce Debate for Six Days with This Rightist Old Politician Who Thought He Had the Eloquence to Reverse Black and White

    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 25th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Yang Ying reported): Wang Zaoshi, a key member of the Zhang-Luo alliance's Shanghai rightist group, relying on his twenty years of political experience and the sophistry of an old lawyer who could reverse black and white, had been "very calm" in the thirty-odd debates, large and small, since the launch of the anti-rightist struggle. At the preparatory meeting of the Shanghai People's Congress, he looked around proudly and said to the representatives debating with him, "If you say I am a rightist, please provide evidence."

    Facts speak louder than words. The representatives used a large number of facts to engage in six days of intense debate with Wang Zaoshi, refuting him until he was incoherent and had to admit defeat. At the last preparatory meeting group session held yesterday, Wang Zaoshi admitted that he was a criminal who opposed the Communist Party and socialism.

　　Was it Consistent Following the Communist Party? Or Consistent Slandering of the Communist Party?

    For two months, Wang Zaoshi's first line of defense was to portray himself as consistently following the Communist Party and supporting the Communist Party and socialism. This intense debate began with this question. The representatives cited Wang Zaoshi's article "From Mandate of Heaven to Rogue Emperor" published in the "New Moon" magazine in 1931 to peel away this layer of pretense. In the last paragraph of this article, Wang Zaoshi wrote: "Since the Communist Party split with the Kuomintang, it lost its basis for activity, so it took risks and combined with bandits, adopting the policies of scorched earth and murder of Zhang Xianzhong and Li Zicheng." However, Wang Zaoshi said that he turned to the left after joining the Civil Rights Protection League in 1933, and began to follow the Communist Party when he joined the National Salvation Association in 1935. Because he did not understand the intentions of the Communist Party, he was distant from the Communist Party. Therefore, the representatives brought out Wang Zaoshi's book "Collection of Absurdities," published in June 1935, to criticize him. In the preface to this booklet, a compilation of anti-communist and anti-Soviet views, Wang Zaoshi wrote: "In my opinion, this high-level argument (anti-communist and anti-Soviet argument) may be too serious, or too un-absurd." To describe anti-Soviet and anti-communist statements as "too un-absurd," Wang Zaoshi's position can be imagined. He admitted that he engaged in the "third road" twice in 1937 and 1946 - at critical moments determining the fate of the country, which was anti-communist.

    Wang Zaoshi's lie of "consistently following the Communist Party" was shattered. But he still wanted to quibble, and suddenly thought of a "brilliant metaphor." He said that it might be compared to taking a streetcar; the Communist Party was going from Jing'an Temple to the Bund (both place names in Shanghai), and I started with the Communist Party from Jing'an Temple, but I got off halfway at Wing On Company, so at least I got to Wing On Company, and you can't say that I consistently opposed the Communist Party.

    One representative immediately exposed Wang Zaoshi's "brilliant metaphor." This representative said, a streetcar departs from Jing'an Temple, and on it are people going to work on the Bund to build socialism; there may also be thieves planning to go to Wing On Company to steal things, or people with ulterior motives going to peddle Fabian socialism. Do you mean to say that these two people have the same political direction?

    People pointed out that although Wang Zaoshi had "cooperated" with the Communist Party on the position of anti-imperialism, anti-feudalism, and anti-Chiang, his position was that of the bourgeoisie, and his direction was that of the bourgeoisie. In the million words he wrote, there was not a single article supporting the Communist Party and socialism.

    However, Wang Zaoshi had one last trump card in his hand, which was that he had served as the director of the "Front Daily" in Jiangxi during the Anti-Japanese War. Wang Zaoshi affirmed that the "Front Daily" played a progressive role. He never mentioned the word "Communist bandits."

    Let the facts speak for themselves. The representatives dug up the "Front Daily" from more than a decade ago. In 1941, Wang Zaoshi's "Front Daily" editorial expressed support for Chiang Kai-shek's manufacturing of the Southern Anhui Incident, massacring the New Fourth Army, and echoed the Kuomintang's rhetoric, saying that "military orders must be unified, and the organization must be unified," attempting to eliminate the New Fourth Army and the Border Region Government.

　　Was it "Good Intentions Doing Bad Things?" Or Ulterior Motives?

    Wang Zaoshi adopted a step-by-step tactic. After his first line of defense was breached, he built a new line of defense. Wang Zaoshi insisted that he was "doing bad things with good intentions," attempting to defend his crime of setting fires everywhere during the blooming period. According to him, the consequences of his remarks were anti-communist and anti-socialist, but his motives were to love the Party and the country. Social practice is the only criterion for measuring the goodness of motives. The representatives once again debated with Wang Zaoshi using the weapons of Marxism-Leninism. The representatives pointed out that Wang Zaoshi obliterated achievements, made alarming statements on purpose, and created sensationalism; he advocated using a telescope to look at achievements and a microscope to look at shortcomings. The representatives questioned Wang Zaoshi: "You know the Communist Party's rectification policy, but you advocated focusing the blooming on the grassroots level and inciting students to strike and cause trouble. Can you say that your motives were good?"

    The representatives exposed the various facts of Wang Zaoshi's vicious attacks on socialist legality after returning to Shanghai from Beijing in March of this year: Wang Zaoshi openly promoted the spirit of capitalist legality. He said, "American democracy is hypocritical, but the legal system is serious." He said that our constitution is gradually being ignored and is sleeping. He also said that in our country, cadres have no law to follow, the general public has no law to abide by, rights and obligations are not clear, and there is no clear boundary between committing a crime and not committing a crime. He portrayed our country as a lawless country. After Wang Zaoshi completely obliterated the achievements of socialist legal construction, he further attempted to gather a group of old legal personnel to let them "return to the team" and篡改 the Communist Party's socialist legal line. The representatives questioned Wang Zaoshi, can these reactionary remarks be said to have only bad objective effects?

    One representative said that Wang Zaoshi admitted that he had political ambitions. Being a few "ministers" or "responsible persons of democratic parties" was not to his taste, but he wanted to be someone who had a real effect on Chinese politics. Is Wang Zaoshi's political ambition not subjective, but objective?

    Wang Zaoshi was unable to answer for a while, and took out a report by Dong Biwu at the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China from his briefcase, and read it aloud for nearly half an hour. He falsely claimed that his fallacies were "derived" from this report. The representatives immediately pointed out that Dong Biwu's report was based on affirming the achievements of socialist legal construction and then proposing the shortcomings in the work. But Wang Zaoshi completely negated the achievements, what was his motive?

    People asked Wang Zaoshi what position he was standing on. Wang Zaoshi said that he was basically on the bourgeois position, following the Communist Party's socialist direction. Under the laughter of the representatives, he himself felt that it was not logical and changed it to the bourgeois position, the direction of Fabian socialism. Later, thinking it was too serious, he changed it to a non-proletarian position, and finally changed it to a petty-bourgeois position. In two or three days, he changed several positions in a row. After debate, he finally had to admit that he was standing on the bourgeois position. He said: "I am not saying that my subjective wishes are good, I have committed a crime against the people."

    At this point, Wang Zaoshi had to retreat another step. However, he said that he spread anti-communist and anti-socialist remarks unconsciously.

　　Was it "Unintentional Coincidence" with the Zhang-Luo Alliance?

    Wang Zaoshi's relationship with the Zhang-Luo alliance was the topic that Wang Zaoshi was most unwilling to talk about. He only confessed that when he went to Beijing in March of this year to attend the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Zhang Naiqi, and Gu Zhizhong were particularly kind to him, inviting him to dinner and coffee. Luo Longji complimented his speech at the CPPCC meeting as "logically rigorous." Luo Longji said that in the articles he had read, only two people had such rigorous logic, one was Lenin, and the other was Wang Zaoshi.

    The representatives revealed that after Wang Zaoshi colluded with the heads of the Zhang-Luo alliance in Beijing, he reversed his past "silence" and set fires everywhere at the propaganda work conference, the CPPCC meeting, Fudan University, and the "Xinwen Ribao" forum. Wang Zaoshi had close relationships with Sun Dayu and Lu Yi of the Shanghai rightist group of the Zhang-Luo alliance. Their anti-communist and anti-socialist activities were all secretly planned with Wang Zaoshi in advance.

    But Wang Zaoshi only admitted that this was "unintentional coincidence," "mutual response," and "resonance in thought."

    Despite Wang Zaoshi's eloquence, in the face of ironclad facts, all kinds of tricks could not deny his reactionary crimes. Wang Zaoshi's "gentleman" signboard was shattered by the facts, and he was a complete, veteran rightist.

　　剥开一层层的画皮　攻破一道道的防线
　　理正词严驳倒王造时
　  上海人民代表和这个自恃有颠倒黑白的辩才的右派老政客激烈辩论了六天
    新华社上海25日电　新华社记者杨瑛报道：章罗联盟上海右派集团的骨干分子王造时，自恃有二十多年搞政治的经验，又有旧律师颠倒黑白的辩才，在反右派斗争开展以来的三十次大小辩论中，一直表现得“十分沉着”。在上海人民代表大会预备会议上，他昂首四顾，洋洋得意地向和他论战的代表说：“要说我是右派分子，请拿出根据来。”
    事实胜于雄辩。代表们以大量的事实和王造时进行了六天的激烈辩论，已驳得他语无伦次，不得不败下阵来。在昨天举行的最后一次预备会议分组会上，王造时承认他自己是反共反社会主义的罪人。
　　是一贯追随共产党？还是一贯诋毁共产党？
    两个月来，王造时坚守的第一道防线是：把自己说成是一贯追随共产党，拥护共产党，拥护社会主义的。这次激烈的论战就从这个问题开始。代表们举出王造时1931年在“新月”杂志上发表的“由真命天子到流氓皇帝”的文章来剥他这一层画皮。王造时在这篇文章最后一段写道：“共产党自与国民党分家之后，失却活动的凭借，于是挺而走险，而与土匪结合，采行张献忠、李自成杀人放火的流寇政策。”但是，王造时却说他从1933年加入民权保障同盟以后向左转了，1935年参加救国会开始追随共产党，由于不明白共产党的意图，因此和共产党有距离。于是代表们又拿出王造时在1935年6月发表的著作“荒谬集”来批驳他。王造时在这本集反共反苏之大成的小册子的序言中写道：“在我看来，则认为这种高论（反共反苏的高论）或许过于正经，或许太不荒谬。”把反苏反共的言论说成“太不荒谬”，王造时的立场可想而知了。他承认，1937年和1946年——在决定国家命运的重要关头，他两次搞“第三条路线”，是反共的。
    王造时“一贯追随共产党”的谎言破产了。但是他还要狡辩，灵机一动，忽然想到一个“妙喻”。他说，不妨以乘电车为例，共产党是从静安寺到外滩（都是上海市区内的地名），我同共产党从静安寺一起出发，但我到中途永安公司下来了，所以我起码也到了永安公司，不能说我一贯反对共产党。
    有一个代表一语道破了王造时的“妙喻”。这位代表说，一列电车从静安寺出发，这上面有去外滩上工，建设社会主义的；也可能有小偷，打算去永安公司偷东西，或者别有用心，去贩卖费边社会主义，你说难道这两人的政治方向是一样的吗？
    人们指出：王造时虽然在反帝反封建反蒋的立场上，一度和共产党“合作”过，但他的立场是资产阶级的立场，他的方向是资产阶级的方向。在他所写的一百万字的著作里，没有一篇是拥护共产党和社会主义的。
    但是，王造时手里还有最后一张王牌，就是抗日战争时期他担任过江西“前方日报”社长。王造时肯定“前方日报”是起了进步作用的。从来没有提过“共匪”字样。
    还是让事实来说话吧，代表们翻出了十多年前的“前方日报”。1941年，王造时的“前方日报”社论中，表示支持蒋介石制造皖南事变，屠杀新四军，并学着国民党的腔调，说什么“军令必须一个，组织必须一个”，妄图消灭新四军和边区政府。
　　是“好心做了坏事”？还是别有用心？
    王造时采取步步为营的战术，当他的第一道防线被攻破后，他又筑起了一道新的防线。王造时坚持说他是“好心做了坏事”，企图为他在鸣放期间到处放火的罪行辩护。据他说，他的言论所造成的后果是反共反社会主义的，但是他的动机是爱党爱国的。社会实践是衡量动机好坏的唯一标准。代表们以马克思列宁主义的武器再度和王造时论战。代表们指出，王造时抹煞成绩，故作危言，耸人听闻；他主张要用望远镜来看成绩，用显微镜来看缺点。代表们责问王造时：“你明知共产党的整风政策，但却主张把鸣放重点放在基层，鼓动学生罢课闹事，这难道能说你的动机是好的吗？”
    代表们揭露了王造时在今年3月从北京回上海以后恶毒攻击社会主义法制的种种事实：王造时公开宣扬资本主义的法制精神。他说，“美国的民主是虚伪的，但法制是认真的。”他说，我国的宪法逐渐被人漠视，在睡觉了。他还说，在我们国家里，干部无法可依，一般人民无法可守，权利与义务搞不清楚，犯罪不犯罪没有明确的界线。他把我国说成是一个无法无天的国家。王造时在对社会主义法制建设的成绩一笔抹煞以后，又进一步企图纠集一批旧法人员让他们“归队”，篡改共产党的社会主义法制路线。代表们质问王造时，难道这些反动言行能说只是客观效果不好吗？
    有一位代表说，王造时自认有政治野心，当个把“部长”、“民主党派负责人”还不配胃口，而要当一个对中国政治发生真正作用的人。难道王造时的政治野心不是主观，而是客观的吗？
    王造时一时无法回答，从皮包里找出一份董必武在中共第八次全国代表大会上的报告，当众朗诵近半小时。他诬说他的谬论是从这个报告中“引伸”出来的。代表们当即指出，董必武的这个报告是从肯定社会主义法制建设成绩的基础上提出工作中的缺点的。而王造时却是根本否定成绩，动机究竟何在？
    人们问王造时究竟站在什么立场，王造时说，他基本上是资产阶级的立场，追随共产党的社会主义的方向。在代表们哄笑下，他自己也觉得说不通，改为资产阶级立场，费边社会主义方向。后来想想太严重了，又改为非无产阶级立场，最后又改为小资产阶级的立场。在两三天内，他一连改换了几个立场。经过辩论，最后他不得不承认自己是站在资产阶级立场。他说：“我并不是说我的主观愿望是好的，我对人民犯了罪。”
    至此，王造时不得不又后退了一步。但是，他说，他散播反共反社会主义的言论是不自觉的。
　　和章罗联盟是“不谋而合”吗？
    王造时和章罗联盟的关系，是王造时最不愿意谈的题目，他只交代了今年3月到北京去列席全国政协会议时，章伯钧、罗隆基、章乃器、顾执中对他特别亲热，请他吃饭、喝咖啡。罗隆基恭维他在政协会议上的发言“逻辑严密”。罗隆基说，在他所读过的文章中，逻辑如此严密的，仅二人，一是列宁，另一个便是王造时。
    代表们揭露，王造时在北京和章罗联盟的头子密谋以后回到上海，一反过去的“缄默”，在宣传工作会议上，政协会议上、复旦大学、“新闻日报”的座谈会上到处放火。王造时和章罗联盟上海右派集团的孙大雨、陆诒等都有密切关系。他们的反共反社会主义活动，事前都是和王造时密谋过的。
    但是王造时只承认这是“不谋而合”“相互呼应”，“思想上的共鸣”。
    尽管王造时善辩，但是在铁的事实面前，施尽各种伎俩也抵赖不了他的反动罪行。王造时的“君子”招牌被事实粉碎了，他是一个十足的老牌右派分子。
