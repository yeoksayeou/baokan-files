    From the Hanyeping era to the early days of liberation, the Daye Steel Plant had only built more than 29,000 square meters of dormitories, a primary school for workers' children that could accommodate 200 students, and a clinic with only ten medical and administrative staff in five or six decades. In the seven years or so after liberation, the plant built 84,000 square meters of dormitories for workers, an increase of 3.2 times compared to the original; built four primary schools for workers' children, accommodating 3,500 students, and one spare-time school for workers, with more than 5,000 students; built a well-equipped hospital and sanatorium each, and eight health stations, with a total of 255 beds and 103 doctors and nurses. In addition, it also built workers' clubs, health canteens, kindergartens, etc. However, on the one hand, the factory's production developed very rapidly (last year's steel production increased more than tenfold compared to the early days of liberation), and the number of workers increased significantly, so the welfare undertakings already in place were still somewhat short of objective needs; on the other hand, the factory used to entrust these matters to a small number of full-time cadres, without publicizing or explaining to the masses, so the masses did not understand the efforts made by the state and the factory in this regard. In addition, the factory's leading cadres sometimes made rash promises, and workers would criticize the leaders for being bureaucratic and have many opinions if they were slightly dissatisfied with their welfare.

    After studying Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," the Party Committee of the factory decided to submit the welfare plan to the masses for discussion and joint supervision. Initially, some comrades were afraid that the masses would make excessive demands and they would be unable to step down. However, in the worker group discussions and the workers' representative meetings, the vast majority of the masses had a deep understanding of the principle of "building the country through diligence and thrift" and automatically criticized the excessive demands in the past. A worker representative from the rolling mill said, "In the past, I wanted something, and the leadership had to give it to me. Whenever I wanted it, you had to give it to me. Otherwise, you were bureaucratic. This was actually the idea of having everything provided by the public. Now we realize that: the wool comes from the sheep. We can't produce something and eat it all up." The masses also criticized the leadership for making rash promises in the past (such as proposing to "eliminate the phenomenon of living in thatched huts within a year"), as well as some unreasonable systems and chaotic management.

    The worker representatives also revised the overly high and large parts of the draft plan in accordance with the spirit of "spending less money and getting more done." For example, the draft plan stipulated that more buildings should be built for worker dormitories, but the representatives suggested that some of the buildings should be converted into bungalows, which would save money and allow for the construction of 495 more houses. The draft plan also stipulated that kindergartens, nurseries, and health stations should be built in the new workers' village, but the representatives also believed that these could be temporarily postponed and instead converted into 2,900 square meters of single dormitories and 600 square meters of family guesthouses to solve the most urgent problems of single workers' accommodation and temporary reception of family members from other places. The draft plan stipulated that 30,000 yuan should be used to purchase a large truck for hauling garbage, but the representatives also believed that this could be replaced by manual labor and advocated canceling this project. In total, after discussion and revision by the representatives, the state could save more than 200,000 yuan to solve more problems.

    The factory also explained some excessive demands. For example, some workers lived in rural areas more than ten miles away from the factory and requested the factory to install electric lights, connect tap water, and provide transportation by car. The leadership calculated the costs for the masses: there were only sixty or seventy workers living relatively concentratedly in the Daoshifu village, but just pulling electric wires and planting electric poles would cost twenty or thirty thousand yuan, and the state could not provide so much money. Even if the state could do this, it would have to consider that this would alienate itself from the surrounding peasant masses, which would be detrimental to the worker-peasant alliance. The workers felt that this was very correct and automatically withdrew their opinions.

    After the meeting, some of the masses still lacked confidence in whether the leadership would seriously implement the plan. So the factory organized eighteen worker representatives to inspect the implementation of the plan at the grassroots level. Through this inspection, the representatives saw that the leading cadres of the electric furnace workshop and the heat treatment workshop had truly done their best to "try every means and overcome difficulties" in solving heatstroke prevention measures; they saw that the property section had sent people to Beijing, Shanghai, Dabie Mountain, and other places to find ways to overcome material difficulties and ensure that the housing projects were completed on schedule, and they were all very moved. The representatives also investigated some of the problems that had not been solved. For example, this year, the factory needed 48 tons of sugar to supply the high-temperature workshop workers with soda water, but Huangshi City only supplied 18 tons of sugar to the entire city in one quarter, which was objectively difficult. The representatives automatically went back to explain to the masses the reason why the soda water was not sweet, and some workers even drew cartoons of "Uncle, don't grab..." to publicize that the limited sugar should be given to the children. During the inspection, the representatives also found that eleven workers had preemptively occupied houses, and twenty-one technicians were unwilling to move to the designated dormitories and lived in the guesthouse for a long time, with the factory paying six jiao per person per day for rent, which were excessive demands and violations of the rules. The representatives also raised their opinions and demanded that the factory take them seriously.

    大伙商量好办事
    本报记者　曹葆铭
    大冶钢厂从汉冶萍时代至解放初期，五六十年间只修建了二万九千多平方公尺的宿舍、容二百人的职工子弟小学一所和只有十个医务行政人员的门诊所一个，而且多是为高级人员享受。在解放后的七年多里，这个厂修建了职工宿舍八万四千多平方公尺，比原来增加了三点二倍；修建了职工子弟小学四所，容纳三千五百人，职工业余学校一所，有五千多人上学；修建了设备完善的医院和疗养院各一所、保健站八个，共有二百五十五张床位，一百零三个医生、护士，另外还建设了职工俱乐部、保健食堂、幼儿园等等。但是，一方面由于工厂生产发展很快，（去年的钢产量较解放初期增长十倍以上），职工人数增加很多，已举办的生活福利事业与客观需要还有一定距离；一方面由于工厂过去将这些事情只交少数专职干部处理，不向群众宣传、解释，群众不了解国家和工厂在这方面所作的努力。加上工厂领导干部有时乱许愿，职工在生活福利上稍有些不如意，就指责领导是官僚主义，意见很多。
    这个厂的党委学习了毛主席的“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”以后，决定将生活福利计划交给群众讨论，共同监督执行。最初，有的同志还怕群众提出过高要求，下不了台。但是，在工人小组讨论会和职工代表会议上，绝大多数群众都对“勤俭建国”的方针很有体会，自动批判了过去过高的要求。轧钢车间的职工代表就这样说：“过去是我要什么，领导上就得给什么，我什么时候要，你就得什么时候给。不然你就是官僚主义。这实际是什么都要公家包下来的思想。现在我们体会到：羊毛出在羊身上。不能生产一个吃光一个。”群众还对领导上过去乱许愿（如提出“一年内消灭住茅棚的现象”），以及某些制度不合理、管理混乱等，提出了批评。
    职工代表还根据“少花钱、多办事”的精神，对计划草案偏高偏大之处作了修正。例如草案中规定职工宿舍多盖楼房，代表们提意见将部分楼房改建平房，可省下钱来多建四百九十五户住宅。草案中规定在新工人村建造幼儿园、托儿所、保健站等，代表们也认为这些可以暂时不盖，而改为建造二千九百平方公尺的单人宿舍和六百平方公尺的家属招待所，以解决目前最急迫的单身工人住宿问题和外地工人临时接待家属的问题。草案中规定用三万元购置一辆拖垃圾用的大汽车，代表们也认为可用人工代替，主张取消这个项目。总计起来，经过代表讨论、修正后，国家可以省出二十多万元来解决更多的问题。
    对一些过高的要求，工厂也作了解释。例如有的工人住在离工厂十多里的农村，要求工厂为他们按电灯、接自来水，用汽车接送，领导上向群众算了一笔账：比较集中地住在道士袱这个农村的工人才六七十人，但光牵电线，栽电线杆，就得二三万元，国家不可能拿出这么多钱来。即使国家能这样作，也得考虑这样会使自己脱离周围的农民群众，对工农联盟不利。工人听了觉得很对，就自动取消了自己的意见。
    会后，有的群众还对领导是否认真执行计划的信心不足。于是工厂又组织十八名职工代表到基层视察计划的执行情况。通过这次视察，代表们看见电炉车间和热处理车间领导干部在解决防暑措施上，真正是做到了“千方百计，克服困难”；看到房产科派人到北京、上海、大别山等地，想方设法克服材料困难，使住宅工程按期施工，都很感动。对一些没有解决的问题，代表们也作了调查。例如这个厂今年暑季供应高温车间工人的汽水，需用糖四十八吨，但黄石市一个季度才供应全市十八吨糖，客观上有困难。代表们就自动回去向群众解释汽水不甜的原因，有的职工还画出“叔叔，不要抢……”的漫画，宣传应将有限的糖让给孩子们吃。在视察中，代表们还发现十一户工人事先抢占房屋，有二十一名技术员不肯搬到指定的宿舍，长期住招待所，由工厂每天给每人垫付六角钱的房租等要求过高，不按制度办事的现象。代表们也提出了意见，要求工厂严肃对待。
