Xinhua News Agency, August 26th. The Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences held an inaugural meeting today for five institutes, namely Crop Breeding and Cultivation, Soil and Fertilizer, Plant Protection, Animal Husbandry, and Cotton, as well as two research offices for Atomic Energy Utilization and Agricultural Meteorology. Representatives from relevant units such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing Agricultural University, and the Central Meteorological Science Institute also attended.

At the meeting, Chen Fengtong, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, announced the list of heads of each institute and research office. He then said that the country's agricultural production and construction have placed urgent tasks on agricultural science. Under the leadership of the Party, we must strengthen the organization and leadership of research work and concentrate our efforts on solving various major problems that urgently need to be addressed in production. Chen Fengtong pointed out that each specialized institute should adopt rapid and effective methods to carry out the selection and breeding of various major crops, especially rice, wheat, and cotton; at the same time, conduct research on farming and cultivation systems in different regions, and combine soil research and fertilizer experiments with different regions, different crops, and different farming and cultivation systems. Chen Fengtong said that plant protection work is also very important, and scientists must use new scientific achievements to solve and prevent major pests and diseases of major crops. Animal husbandry is an important link in developing diversified agricultural operations. Therefore, it is also essential to carry out the selection and breeding of new breeds, increase the reproduction rate, and study how to establish feed bases and improve the feeding and management techniques of livestock in cooperatives. In addition, agricultural meteorology and the utilization of atomic energy in agriculture are new disciplines in our country. After several years of effort, we will certainly be able to achieve results.

Chen Fengtong announced at the meeting that the establishment of each specialized institute is based on the relevant departments of the North China Agricultural Science Institute. Therefore, after the establishment of the various specialized institutes (offices) of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the North China Agricultural Science Institute has completed its historical mission, and the name of this institute will be cancelled.

Liu Ruilong, Vice Minister of Agriculture, gave a report to the scientists at the meeting. He pointed out that agricultural scientists should strive to accelerate the development of agriculture in our country and to establish a modern agricultural foundation in our country. Liu Ruilong said that agricultural science has developed on the basis of the development of agricultural production. However, the bourgeois rightists with ulterior motives have incited agricultural scientists to refuse to serve agricultural production. Their purpose is to oppose agricultural scientists from serving socialist construction and to sit idly by while agricultural production in our country remains backward. Liu Ruilong also condemned various fallacies of the rightists, which negated the scientific value of China's agricultural heritage and underestimated the rich experience accumulated by Chinese farmers in thousands of years of production practice; and negated the necessity for agricultural scientists to go deep into production practice. Liu Ruilong called on all agricultural scientists to unite closely under the leadership of the Party, thoroughly smash the conspiracies of the bourgeois rightists, continue to implement the spirit of combining theory with practice, establish contact with farmers, constantly summarize and improve farmers' production experience, and conduct in-depth research to develop agricultural science. Liu Ruilong also demanded that agricultural scientists resolutely implement the policy of running science diligently and frugally, and eliminate the bourgeois ideological viewpoints of pursuing science for the sake of science and starting from personal interests.

Zhu Kezhen, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Shi Ping, Vice President of Beijing Agricultural University, also spoke at the meeting.

    为加速发展农业生产进行科学研究
　　中国农业科学院举行专业研究所（室）成立大会
    新华社26日讯　中国农业科学院今天举行了作物育种栽培、土壤肥料、植物保护、畜牧、棉花等五个研究所，以及原子能利用、农业气象两个研究室的成立大会。中国科学院、北京农业大学和中央气象科学研究所等有关单位也派代表参加。
    会上，中国农业科学院副院长陈凤桐宣布各研究所和研究室负责人的名单以后说，国家的农业生产建设对农业科学提出了迫切的任务。我们必须在党的领导下加强对研究工作的组织领导，集中力量解决生产上迫切需要解决的各种重大问题。陈凤桐指出，各专业研究所应该采取迅速有效的方法，分别进行各种主要作物，特别是稻、麦、棉的选种和育种工作；同时，进行不同地区耕作栽培制度的研究工作，并且结合不同地区、不同作物、不同耕作栽培制度进行土壤研究和肥料试验工作。陈凤桐说，植物保护工作也很重要，科学家们要以新的科学成就，解决和预防主要作物的主要虫害和病害。畜牧业是开展农业多种经营的重要环节，因此进行选种和培育新种、提高繁殖率，研究如何建立饲料基地和改进合作社家畜的饲养管理技术，也是十分必要的。此外，农业气象、原子能在农业上的利用在我国都是新的学科，经过若干年的努力，也一定能够作出成绩的。
    陈凤桐在会上宣布，各专业研究所的建立是以华北农业科学研究所的有关各系作基础的，因此中国农业科学院各专业所（室）建立后，华北农业科学研究所完成了它的历史任务，这个研究所的名义即行取消。
    农业部副部长刘瑞龙在会上向科学家们作了报告。他指出，农业科学家应该为加速我国农业的发展，为建立我国现代化农业基础而努力。刘瑞龙说，农业科学是在农业生产发展的基础上发展起来的。但是别有用心的资产阶级右派分子煽动农业科学家拒绝为农业生产服务，其目的就是为了反对农业科学家为社会主义建设服务，坐视我国农业生产处于落后状态。刘瑞龙还斥责了右派分子种种谬论，这些谬论否定我国农学遗产的科学价值，轻视我国农民数千年来生产实践中积累起来的丰富经验；否定农业科学工作者必须深入生产实际。刘瑞龙号召全体农业科学工作者在党的领导下紧密团结起来，彻底粉碎资产阶级右派分子的阴谋；继续贯彻理论结合实际的精神，与农民建立联系，不断总结和提高农民的生产经验，深入研究，发展农业科学。刘瑞龙还要求农业科学工作者们坚决贯彻勤俭办科学的方针，肃清为科学而科学、从个人兴趣出发的资产阶级思想观点。
    中国科学院副院长竺可桢、北京农业大学副校长施平等也在会上讲了话。
