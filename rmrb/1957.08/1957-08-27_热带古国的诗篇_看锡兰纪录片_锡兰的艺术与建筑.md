　　A Poem of a Tropical Ancient Kingdom
　　——Watching the Ceylon Documentary “The Art and Architecture of Ceylon”

　　Ceylon has always been praised as the pearl of the Orient, not only for its beautiful natural environment and abundant resources, but also for its long history of more than two thousand and five hundred years. The people are hardworking and peace-loving, possess their own glorious and splendid cultural and artistic heritage, and like many Asian countries, they have also experienced a long history of imperialist aggression and struggle against colonial destiny. These common characteristics make us feel even closer and more intimate.
　　Ceylon is an ancient Buddhist country. Therefore, the history of the development of Buddhist culture is also the history of Ceylon's culture and art. However, those temples and pagodas with their own unique styles, those rivers and sacred Buddhist sites with beautiful legends and epics, those exquisite and magnificent sculptures, and the splendid and brilliant murals, just like the famous Ajanta Grottoes in India, and the Dunhuang murals and the Maijishan Grotto art in our country, are not only the pride of the nation, but also treasures of the world's art treasury.
　　“The Art and Architecture of Ceylon” gives us a comprehensive outline and a beautiful impression of Ceylon’s religious art. The film begins with the tranquil and sparkling waters of the Kelani River, with tropical dugout canoes and palm trees like the arms of giants, leading people into a distant, poetic realm, just like opening "Arabian Nights" or reading the opening sentences of an ancient legend from a tropical country. You see, like a eternally youthful fairy, the beautiful Kelani River flows quietly and endlessly… According to legend, the Buddha once came to Kelaniya. In Lanka, the Bodhi tree enjoys people's respect. These pagodas have a history of more than two thousand years and were built by King Dutugemunu, who advocated martial arts. With the rise and fall of the dynasty, after the eighth century AD, they were submerged in ruins for more than a thousand years. The Wangnuweli Pagoda is vast, tall, magnificent, and solid, and is one of the models of ancient pagoda architecture. The Duparama Pagoda, the pagoda on the east coast of Siriya Island, and the Mirigiriya Pagoda are all buildings from the seventh century AD. These pagodas can help people study the development of pagoda architecture.
　　From the images on the walls and carved out of them, or standing in the main halls of famous temples, there are high achievements in Buddhist sculpture art. Sculpting huge Buddha statues has been popular in Ceylon since ancient times. In the film, we see the largest and best statue in Ceylon's religious art - that is the Buddha statue of Akana Temple, which is forty-three meters high. Its artistic feature lies in the superb skills in expressing the folds of robes. The several huge Buddha statues carved in the Karvihara Grotto in the 12th century are not only dignified and magnificent in shape, but also serene and kind in expression, showing the characteristics of Buddhist statues.
　　As a part of Buddhist sculpture art, decorative art can be seen on the broken pillars and stone tablets around countless ancient temples. The extremely exquisite carvings, the delicate and gorgeous floral patterns, the vivid and lifelike rare birds and animals make people marvel at the artistic genius of the people of Ceylon, and wish the camera could stay in front of them for a moment longer.
　　Ceylon's splendid murals, mainly in red, yellow, and green, have their own long tradition of popular style. The Sigiriya murals on the western slope of the Sigiriya rock fortress, built in the second century, are world-renowned and highly regarded. After the 12th century AD, murals developed greatly. The painted patterns of the Dambulla Cave Temple, symbolizing the prosperous lotus patterns of the times, are very prominent. The murals preserved in Yabahuwa and other places in the 14th century AD mostly depict dancing girls with lively dance postures. The murals treasured in the Kardo Nuwa Temple in the 18th century AD depict the vivid image of Buddha with a distinct popular style.
　　The documentary "The Art and Architecture of Ceylon" seems to have opened a dazzling treasure chest in front of our eyes. It takes more time to appreciate these treasures. However, in a short two or thirty minutes, it also helps us to further understand our friends from the perspective of ancient culture and art.
　　Compared with the brilliant cultural and artistic achievements of ancient times, Ceylon's film industry is obviously young. However, in order to vigorously develop the national film industry, the Ceylon government has taken a series of positive measures in recent years. In the not-too-distant future, Ceylon's film industry will grow rapidly in the free artistic labor of the people, and bloom more beautiful flowers. This is entirely predictable.

　　热带古国的诗篇
　　——看锡兰纪录片“锡兰的艺术与建筑”
　  丁峤
    锡兰一向被誉为东方的珍珠，不仅自然环境美丽和物产富庶，而且有着二千五百年以上的悠久历史。人民勤劳而酷爱和平，拥有自己民族的辉煌灿烂的文化艺术遗产，并且像亚洲的许多国家一样，也有过一段长久被帝国主义侵略和反抗殖民地命运的斗争历史，这些共同的特点，使我们之间更加感到接近和亲切。
    锡兰是一个佛教古国，因此，佛教文化发展的历史，也就是锡兰文化艺术的历史。但是，那些具有自己独特风格的寺庙、佛塔，那些流传着美丽的传说与史诗的河流、佛地，那些精美壮丽的雕塑和灿烂辉煌的壁画，正像印度著名的阿旃陀石窟和我国的敦煌壁画，麦积山石窟艺术一样，不仅是本民族的骄傲，而且也是世界艺术宝库的珍品。
    “锡兰的艺术与建筑”给了我们欣赏锡兰宗教艺术的一个全面的轮廓和美好的印象。影片以宁静而闪闪发光的凯拉尼河水；以富有热带情调的独木舟和像巨人臂掌似的棕榈树开头，把人引进遥远的、诗意的境界中去，就像翻开“天方夜谭”或读一本热带国家的古老传说的开头的句子一样。你看仿佛是一个青春永驻的仙女，美丽的凯拉尼河静静地，永不停息地流着……，相传佛祖曾经来到了凯拉尼亚，在兰卡，菩提树享受着人们的尊敬。这些佛塔，有着两千多年的历史，崇尚武功的杜突格莫奴国王所修建。随着皇朝的盛衰，公元八世纪以后，在废墟中被湮没了一千多年。汪奴维里佛塔广阔高大，宏伟坚固，是古代佛塔建筑的典范之一。杜帕拉马的佛塔，西里亚伊岛东岸的佛塔，米的里吉里雅佛塔，都是公元七世纪的建筑物，这些佛塔，可以帮助人们考证佛塔建筑的发展。
    从在壁上和凿出来的或屹立在著名寺庙的大殿中的形象，在佛教雕塑艺术上有着很高的造诣。雕塑巨大的佛像，在锡兰从古就盛行。在影片里，我们看到了锡兰宗教艺术上最大最好的塑像——那就是阿卡纳寺的佛像，高达四十三公尺，它的艺术特点，在于表现衣袍折皱上的高超的技巧。同凿于十二世纪的卡尔维哈拉石窟的几尊巨大的佛像，不但造形端庄壮丽而且神情冥静慈祥，表现了佛教塑像的特点。
    作为佛教雕塑艺术的一部分的装饰艺术，在无数古庙名刹周围的残破的柱石上和石碑上，我们可以看到无比精美的雕刻，精细华丽的花卉图案，维肖维妙，栩栩如生的珍禽奇兽，使人不禁为锡兰人民的艺术天才赞叹，并恨不得镜头能在眼前多停留一刻。
    锡兰的以红、黄、绿三种颜色为主色的灿烂的壁画，有着自己悠久的通俗风格的传统。建造于二世纪的西吉利亚石堡山西坡的西吉利亚壁画，闻名于世界并享有很高的评价。公元十二世纪以后，壁画有了很大的发展，旦布拉石窟的彩绘，象征时代繁华的莲花图案非常突出。公元十四世纪雅巴胡瓦等保留下来的壁画，多绘翩翩起舞的女郎，舞姿生动的人，在卡尔多奴瓦寺珍藏的公元十八世纪的壁画，以显著的通俗风格，描绘佛的生动形象。
    纪录片“锡兰的艺术与建筑”，仿佛在我们眼前打开了一只光彩夺目的百宝箱，要好好的欣赏一下这些珍宝是需要更多的时间的，然而短短的二三十分钟，同样做到帮助我们从古代的文化艺术方面来进一步了解我们的朋友。
    与古代辉煌灿烂的文化艺术成果比较起来，锡兰的电影事业显然是年青的。但是锡兰政府为了大力发展本国电影事业，近年来已经采取了一系列有积极意义的措施。在不会很长的时期内，锡兰的电影事业，将在人民的自由的艺术劳动中很快的成长起来，开放出更美丽的花朵，这是完全可以预期的。
