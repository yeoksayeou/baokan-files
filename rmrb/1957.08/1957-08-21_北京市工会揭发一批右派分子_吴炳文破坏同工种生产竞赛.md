The Beijing Municipal Trade Union Exposes a Group of Rightists
Wu Bingwen Sabotages Production Competition Among Workers of the Same Trade

　　(From Workers' Daily) The Beijing Federation of Trade Unions and the municipal industrial trade unions have exposed a number of rightists. Among them are: Wu Bingwen, Standing Committee member and instructor of the Building Materials Trade Union; Zhang Junrui, instructor of the Sports Department of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions; Li Weilin, instructor of the Labor Protection Department; and Ye Maolin, Deputy Minister of the Welfare Department of the Education Trade Union.

　　Rightist Wu Bingwen extremely hates leading cadres. He compared them to the "officials" of the old society and "absentee landlords in private enterprises," saying they "only want power and money, but don't do anything." He cursed getting close to the Party as "licking asses." He praised those who opposed the organization and disobeyed the leadership as "born with a bit of a hard head," "unwilling to bend." Wu Bingwen falsely accused the leadership of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions of being a "photo studio," and all its work being a "copy" of the higher-level trade unions and the Municipal Party Committee. Wu Bingwen also sabotaged the competition among workers of the same trade in the building materials system. After the Building Materials Trade Union made the decision to launch a competition among workers of the same trade, he engaged in double-dealing tactics to oppose it. He went to the Production Department of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and relevant industrial bureaus to say that the grassroots cadres did not want to engage in the competition among workers of the same trade, and then went to the grassroots to say that the city did not agree to engage in the competition among workers of the same trade. Later, he even threatened those who led the competition among workers of the same trade, saying: "Go ahead, we'll settle the score at the end of the year."

　　Rightist Ye Maolin particularly admired Ge Peiqi's statement that if the Communist Party is not good, it can be overthrown and killed. As early as October 1956, he wrote in his diary: "Ma Su disregarded national affairs and was executed without injustice." "There are many Ma Su's in the world today, but why are they not punished?" (He himself admitted that Ma Su referred to leading cadres.) He lit fires everywhere in the office. He incited people by saying: "Talk about your experiences." "I support you, I understand your grievances."

　　Rightist Li Weilin in the Party unscrupulously insulted the Party organization, calling the Party branch a "dynasty" and the branch secretary a "king." He agreed with the rightists' saying that "the Party is the embodiment of the three evils" and "Party members cannot have humanity if they have Party spirit." Because his personal ambitions were not fulfilled, he arrogantly said that "the Party is an obstacle to his development path" and that "the Party owes him a debt."

　　Rightist Zhang Junrui in the Party attacked and slandered the Party's agricultural cooperativization policy. As the anti-Rightist struggle entered an intense stage, Zhang Junrui refused to attend meetings. The Party branch specifically held a meeting to decide that he should attend, but he proposed, "I am considering whether I should continue to stay in the Party." Later, he read out his unfinished application to withdraw from the Party at the meeting, in which he arrogantly said that "withdrawing from the Party is to enlighten those who are obsessed," etc. He also posted big-character posters in the office scolding those who criticized him as "crazy," "superstitious," and "will all become historical sinners."

　　The staff of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and various industrial trade unions are continuing to thoroughly expose these rightists and carry out reasoned struggle.

　　北京市工会揭发一批右派分子
　  吴炳文破坏同工种生产竞赛
    本报讯　据工人日报报道：北京市工会联合会及市级各产业工会，已经揭发出一些右派分子。其中有：建筑器材工会常委兼指导员吴炳文、市工会联合会体育部指导员张君瑞、劳动保护部指导员李蔚林、教育工会福利部副部长叶茂林。
    右派分子吴炳文极端仇视领导干部。把他们比作旧社会的“作官儿的”和“私营企业中的甩手掌柜”，“要的只是权和钱，而不办事”。他谩骂靠近党是“舐屁股”。他赞赏与组织闹对立、不服从领导的人是“生来有点硬头皮”，“不愿随弯就曲”。吴炳文诬蔑市工会联合会领导是个“照像馆”，一切工作都是上级工会和市委的“翻版”。吴炳文还破坏建筑器材系统的同工种竞赛，当建筑器材工会作出开展同工种竞赛的决定后，他以两面三刀的手法到处活动，进行反对。他到市工会生产部和有关工业局说基层干部不想搞同工种竞赛，到基层又说市里不同意搞同工种竞赛。后来他还威胁领导开展同工种竞赛的人说：“搞吧，年终再算总账”。
    右派分子叶茂林特别赞赏葛佩琦所说的如果共产党不好，就可以推翻、可以杀。原来他早在1956年10月就在日记中写过：“马谡置国事于不顾，斩之无冤。”“今世马谡不少，不见其罪何也。”（他自己承认马谡系指领导干部）他在机关到处点火。对人煽动说：“谈谈你的遭遇吧。”“我支持你，你的委屈我了解。”
    党内右派分子李蔚林肆无忌惮地辱骂党组织，把党支部称为“王朝”，把支部书记比作“国王”。他同意右派分子的“党是三害的化身”、“党员有党性就不能兼有人性”的说法。因为他自己个人野心未能得逞，竟狂妄地说“党是他发展道路上的障碍”，说“党欠了他的债”。
    党内右派分子张君瑞，攻击和污蔑党的农业合作化政策。反右派斗争进入到激烈阶段，张君瑞拒绝参加会。党支部专门开会决定他去参加，他提出“我正在考虑我是否继续留在党内”。后来又在会上宣读了他未写完的退党申请书，申请书中狂妄地说“退党是给执迷不悟者以启发”等。他还在机关内张贴大字报骂批判他的人都是“发疯了”“迷信了”“都将成为历史上的罪人”。
    对于这些右派分子，市工会联合会和各产业工会工作人员正在继续深入揭露和进行说理斗争。
