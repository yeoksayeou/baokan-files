Qingdao Commodity Inspection Bureau Workers Resolutely Struggle
Lu Kanru's Anti-Party Stronghold is Breached

This newspaper reports that in recent days, all employees of the Qingdao Commodity Inspection Bureau have launched a resolute struggle against the anti-Party vanguard Lu Kanru (Chairman of the Qingdao Branch of the Jiusan Society)'s important stronghold for attacking the Party - the directly affiliated Jiusan Society group of the bureau. This group was only established in March of this year and consisted of four members. According to group leader Tong Suqiu, "I joined the society not to make progress, but because I was dissatisfied with the Communist Party and wanted to find a backer." The motivations of the others for joining were similar to hers, so they naturally became Lu Kanru's "volunteer team" for attacking the Party. After exposure and criticism by all employees, they began to admit that they were directly or indirectly receiving instructions from Lu Kanru, and were attacking the Party in a led, organized, planned, and programmatic manner. According to their confession, after the rectification campaign began, Lu Kanru gave them four instructions one after another:

First, he instructed them to discuss the issue of "abolishing the Party committee system and not letting the Communist Party monopolize everything," and when transmitting Chairman Mao's report on "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," he stirred up their emotions of "contending with the Party on an equal footing." Second, he instructed them to expand the organization, the more people the better, not seeking quality, only quantity. Third, he instructed them to exert pressure on the Party, and all issues, large and small, trivial or important, such as the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, wages, reorganization, and the style of Party members, could be discussed, and they should be presented as much as possible, the more acute the better, and exaggeration was okay. Fourth, he demanded that the Party branch establish a so-called "rectification inspection group," attempting to usurp the Party's leadership.

Tong Suqiu confessed that before the convening of the blooming and contending meetings, they studied the key points of attacking the Party and the list and basis of the targets of attack (Party members, activists). At the forums, they concentrated their fire on insulting the Party and Party members and attacking those who upheld justice, such as saying that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries was so cruel that not even grass would grow; saying that the virtue and talent standards of the cadre policy were boundless; saying that the Party regarded the masses as "captives," "thieves," and "waste"; saying that the Party member directors of each section did not understand their work and should be removed; and comparing the people's democratic dictatorship to the tyranny of Qin Shihuang. In order to implement Lu Kanru's instructions, Tong Suqiu drafted a document called "Problems Existing in the Qingdao Commodity Inspection Bureau Party Branch," which was discussed and supplemented at a group meeting and summarized into seven major "crimes," resembling a "blood and tears accusation."

When the anti-Rightist struggle began, this Rightist clique held a secret group meeting at Tong Suqiu's home to plot countermeasures in preparation for stubborn resistance. After the exposure and questioning by all employees, they had no choice but to bow their heads and confess their guilt, admitting the above facts.

    青岛商检局职工斗争坚决
    陆侃如的反党据点被突破
    本报讯　连日来，青岛市商品检验局全体职工对反党急先锋陆侃如（九三青岛分社主任委员）向党进攻的重要据点——该局的九三直属小组，展开了坚决的斗争。这个小组是今年3月才建立的，共有四个社员，据组长童素秋交代“我入社不是想进步，是因为对共产党不满，为了找靠山。”其他人入社的动机和她都类似，这样他们就很自然地作了陆侃如向党进攻的“义勇队”了。经过全体职工的揭发和批判，他们开始承认自己是直接或间接地接受陆侃如的指令，是有领导、有组织、有计划、有纲领地向党进攻。据交代，在整风开始以后，陆侃如先后给他们四点指令：
    一、指示他们讨论“取消党委制，不要共产党包办”的问题，并在传达毛主席报告中“长期共存、互相监督”时，煽起了他们和党“分庭抗礼”的情绪。二、指示他们，要扩大组织，人愈多愈好，不求质量，只求数量。三、指示他们要对党施加压力，无论肃反、工资、整编、党员作风，大大小小、滴滴点点的问题都可以谈，要尽量摆出来，愈尖锐愈好，夸大也不要紧。四、要求党支部成立所谓“整风检查小组”，企图篡夺党的领导权。
    童素秋交代说，在鸣放的会议召开以前，他们就研究了向党进攻的重点，打击对象（党员、积极分子）的名单和根据，在座谈会上他们集中火力辱骂党和党员，打击主持正义的人。如说肃反运动残酷到草木不生的程度；说干部政策的德才标准是漫无边际；说党把群众看成“俘虏”、“小偷”、“废物”；说各室的党员主任不懂业务，应撤出去；把人民民主专政比成秦始皇的专制。为了执行陆侃如的指示，由童素秋起草，小组开会讨论补充，写出一份“青岛商检局党支部存在的问题”，归纳为七大“罪状”，俨然是“血泪控诉书”。
    当反右派斗争开始以后，这个右派小集团又在童素秋家里开小组会密谋对策，准备顽抗。经过全体职工的揭露和追问，他们不得不低头认罪，承认以上一些事实。
