Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, August 6th: Chen Xinmin, a member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League (CDL), and president and professor of the Central South Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, has been forcing the Chinese Communist Party Committee of the institute to hand over leadership during the Rectification Campaign.

After the start of the Rectification Campaign, Chen Xinmin actively spread anti-Party and anti-socialist fallacies. In an article written for the New Hunan Daily entitled "Distinguishing Fragrant Flowers from Poisonous Weeds Depends on 'Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom, a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend'," he wantonly slandered the Communist Party for not distinguishing between right and wrong, insisting that the Party's criteria for right and wrong were "only based on classics," "only based on the Soviet Union," "only based on class origin," "only based on superstitions," and "only based on leaders." Chen Xinmin also fabricated stories to spread the idea that he was "in position without authority," repeatedly attacking the Communist Party's confidentiality discipline, wanting to interfere in the Party's internal affairs to seize power. He even said bluntly: "The time is not yet ripe for the Communist Party to lead universities." Seeing that the institute had five democratic party organizations and that only one of the three presidents and vice presidents was a Party member, he deliberately put forward the idea of a so-called "leadership core" composed of presidents, vice presidents, Party committee members, and heads of various democratic party organizations, and that this "leadership core" should ideally be "within ten people." According to his own recent confession, his intention was to use the democratic parties to create his own majority and seize leadership independently.

During the Great Blooming and Letting Go, when the rightists were arrogant, Chen Xinmin, as the head of the institute's study leadership group that was helping the Party with rectification, maliciously agreed to the rightists' demand to establish a "Democracy Wall" to attack the Communist Party. He also wrote an inscription to support the reactionary clique "Thawing Society," which was launching a wild attack on the Party. With Chen Xinmin's support, this reactionary clique became even more rampant, colluding and developing organizations everywhere, and openly sending people to the Party Committee's Propaganda Department to demand the takeover of the institute's radio station and participation in the editing of the institute's journal, inciting students to stop taking exams and stop graduation designs, preparing to cause trouble. After the "Thawing Society" disintegrated under the righteous criticism and condemnation of the teachers, students, and staff of the entire institute, Chen Xinmin cheered up Li Zhenya, the head of the "Thawing Society."

When the rightists at the institute were rampant, Chen Xinmin became ecstatic, believing that the situation of forcing the Communist Party to cede leadership had been created, so he openly "demanded power" from the Party. On June 7th, the institute's study leadership group invited the heads of the democratic parties in the institute to a meeting to study the establishment of an investigation team to clarify the truth of the large number of fabricated so-called "exposures" on the "Democracy Wall." At this meeting, Chen Xinmin actually proposed that the study leadership group be expanded and reorganized into a "Committee for Handling Contradictions Among the People," attempting to establish a supreme power organ above the institute's Party Committee and administration, and conspiring to use the majority of democratic party members in the committee to overthrow the Party's leadership. Due to the obstruction of Chen Xinmin and others, the investigation team failed to be established. Later, Chen Xinmin even said to Gu Lingshen, the institute's Party member vice president: "Democratic parties will not speak for the Communist Party! What you say is different from the democratic parties' inner thoughts!" He also advised Gu Lingshen not to "hang" words like "Communist Party leadership" "on his lips" in the future, so as not to make people "uncomfortable." When Gu Lingshen asked him what the "inner thoughts" of the democratic parties were, he said: "It's a question of whether the Communist Party will give up power." When Gu Lingshen told him that the study leadership group had the power to investigate, research, advise, and supervise, Chen Xinmin said bluntly: "The demands of the democratic parties are definitely not limited to this!"

Chen Xinmin's wishful thinking of using the adverse current created by the rightists to force the Party Committee to cede leadership was wrong. After the broad masses of teachers, students, and staff of the entire institute defeated the rampant offensive of the rightists, Chen Xinmin's reactionary words and deeds also began to be exposed.

    民盟右派在中南矿冶学院的代理人
    陈新民要和共产党争权夺势
    据新华社长沙6日电　民盟中央委员、中南矿冶学院院长兼教授陈新民，在整风运动中，硬逼着要这个学院的中共党委会交出领导权。
    陈新民在整风运动开始以后就积极散布反党反社会主义的谬论。他在写给新湖南报的一篇题为“鉴别鲜花毒草要靠‘百花齐放，百家争鸣’”的文章中，肆意诬蔑共产党不分是非，硬说党的是非标准是什么“唯经典论”、“唯苏联论”、“唯成份论”、“唯鬼神论”和“唯领导论”。陈新民还不惜无中生有地到处散布他是“有职无权”的空气，一再攻击共产党的保密纪律，想插手到党内来抓权。他甚至露骨地说：“共产党对高等学校的领导时机还不成熟”。他鉴于学院有五个民主党派组织而三个正副院长中只有一个是党员，就别有用心地提出了所谓有正副院长、党委和各民主党派组织负责人参加的“领导核心”的主张，而且这个“领导核心”最好是“十人以内”。据他本人最近交代，他这一主张是企图利用民主党派造成自己的多数，而独自夺取领导权。
    在大鸣大放中，当右派分子气焰嚣张的时候，身为帮助党整风的全院学习领导小组负责人的陈新民不怀好意地同意了右派分子要建立“民主墙”攻击共产党的要求。他还题词支持向党猖狂进攻的反动小集团“解冻社”。这个反动小集团在陈新民的支持下更加猖狂地到处串连发展组织，并公开派人到党委宣传部要求接收院内广播台、参加院刊编辑，煽动学生停考，停止毕业设计，准备闹事。当“解冻社”在全院师生员工的正义批判、声讨下瓦解后，陈新民还为“解冻社”的负责人李镇亚打气。
    当学院右派分子活动猖狂的时候，陈新民得意忘形，自以为逼着共产党让出领导权的形势已经造成，于是便公开向党“要权”。6月7日，学院学习领导小组邀集学院内民主党派负责人开会，研究成立调查小组弄清“民主墙”上大量无中生有的所谓“揭发”的事实的真象，陈新民在这个会上竟提出了将学习领导小组扩大改组为“处理人民内部矛盾委员会”的主张，企图在学院的党委、行政之上再成立一个最高权力机关，并阴谋用委员会内民主党派成员的多数情况来推翻党的领导。由于陈新民等人的阻碍，调查小组未能成立。后来陈新民竟对这个学院的党员副院长顾凌申说：“要民主党派出来替共产党说话，民主党派不干！你讲的和民主党派的内心想法不同！”他还劝顾凌申以后讲话时不要把“共产党领导”这样的字眼“挂在嘴上”，以免使人“不舒服”。当顾凌申问他民主党派的“内心想法”是什么时，他说：“是共产党放不放权的问题。”当顾凌申告诉他学习领导小组有权调查、研究、建议、监督时，陈新民露骨地说：“民主党派的要求决不止此！”
    陈新民企图利用右派分子造成的逆流威逼党委让出领导权的如意算盘打错了。在全院广大师生员工打垮了右派分子的猖狂攻势以后，陈新民的反动言行，也开始被揭露出来。
