    Xinyang Discovers Large Chu State Wooden Coffin Tomb

    A large wooden coffin tomb discovered in Xinyang County, southern Henan Province, has been confirmed as a relic from the late Warring States period. More than 800 bamboo slips, lacquerware, bronzes, jades, pottery, and ironware were unearthed from this tomb. The leader of the archaeological team responsible for excavating the ancient tomb told reporters: This is the first time in our country that a wooden coffin tomb from the Warring States period with such well-preserved artifacts has been discovered.

    The wooden coffin of the ancient tomb was constructed from more than 370 square timbers. The wooden coffin is more than eight meters long, more than seven meters wide, and more than two meters high, and is divided into seven burial chambers, which is several times larger than the largest Warring States wooden coffin previously discovered in Changsha, Hunan. The earthen pit burying the wooden coffin is nearly ten meters deep. A layer of reed mats was laid on top of the wooden coffin. A layer of fairly thick white pottery clay was also filled around the wooden coffin. Archaeologists believe that the wooden coffin and burial objects (especially perishable wooden objects) were so well preserved because this layer of white pottery clay had a preservative effect.

    Xinyang belonged to the State of Chu during the Warring States period. The inscription on the bronze bell unearthed from the tomb contains the words "Chu territory," and some place names of the State of Chu are also written on the bamboo slips. The wooden coffin, lacquerware, bronzes, etc. unearthed this time all have a distinct Chu cultural style. From the scale of the tomb and the richness and exquisiteness of the burial objects, it can be concluded that the owner of the tomb was a prominent nobleman of the State of Chu.

    Among the unearthed artifacts, the most numerous are lacquerware: there are more than 300 pieces of beds, tables, desks, pillows, wooden figurines, wooden beasts, musical instruments, etc. Most of these lacquerwares are painted. On a broken wooden se (a musical instrument), there are figures and patterns painted with various colors such as gold powder, cinnabar, ochre, and light yellow. Although some painted lacquerwares from the Warring States period have been discovered in the past, they have never been seen to be painted so finely. Most of the lacquerware is very well preserved.

    Among the bamboo slips unearthed this time, the longest one has 47 characters written on it. This is considered to be the bamboo slip with the most characters discovered among the Chu slips in China.

    Among the bronzes unearthed, the most noteworthy is a complete set of chime bells that are as good as new. This set of chime bells consists of thirteen bells of varying sizes, which is completely consistent with the number of bells recorded on the bamboo slips. Researchers from the Institute of National Music of the Central Conservatory of Music specially measured and recorded the sounds of this set of chime bells, and successfully played the tune "The East is Red" with this set of chime bells. According to Wang Shixiang, the associate researcher of the institute, ancient musical instruments that have been preserved for more than two thousand years and still produce fairly clear and beautiful tones are rarely seen in the world.

    This ancient tomb was discovered last spring. Currently, all the cultural relics from the ancient tomb have been transported to Zhengzhou. The Ministry of Culture has transferred some technical personnel from the Beijing History Museum and Hunan Province to prepare for the reproduction of all lacquerware. The Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio has also filmed the excavation of this tomb and the unearthed cultural relics into a news documentary. (Xinhua News Agency reporter Lü Zhongshuang)

### 信阳发现楚国大型木椁墓

    信阳发现楚国大型木椁墓
    在河南省南部信阳县境内发现的一座大型木椁墓，已经证实是战国后期的遗物。在这座墓中出土了八百多件竹简、漆木器、铜器、玉器、陶器和铁器。负责发掘这座古墓的考古队队长对记者说：器物保存得这样完好的战国木椁墓，在我国还是第一次发现。
    古墓的木椁是用三百七十多根方木构筑的。木椁长八公尺多、宽七公尺多、高两公尺多，共分为七个墓室，比以前在湖南长沙发现的最大的战国木椁，还要大好几倍。埋木椁的土坑将近十公尺深。木椁上面铺有一层苇席。围绕着木椁还填有一层相当厚的白陶土。考古学家认为：木椁和随葬器物（特别是易腐的木器）保存得这样完好，是因为这层白陶土有防腐作用。
    信阳在战国时属楚国。墓里出土的铜钟上的铭文有“楚境”等字，竹简上也写着一些楚国的地名。这次出土的木椁、漆器、铜器等，也都带有鲜明的楚文化风格。从墓的规模和随葬品的丰富精美，可以断定墓的主人是楚国的一个显赫贵族。
    出土的器物中，最多的是漆木器：有床、案、几、枕和木俑、木兽、乐器等共三百多件。这些漆器中，绝大部分都是绘彩的。在一个残破了的木瑟（一种乐器）上，有用金粉、朱砂、赭石、浅黄等各种颜色画的人物和图案。战国绘彩漆器过去虽然发现过一些，但从没有见过画得这样精细的。漆木器大部分都保存得很完好。
    这次出土的竹简中，最多的一条上写着四十七个字。这在我国已发现的楚简中，要算是字数最多的一条。
    出土的铜器中，最值得注意的是一套完整如新的编钟。这套编钟共十三个，大小不一，同竹简上记载的钟的数目完全相符。中央音乐学院民族音乐研究所的研究人员，曾特地为这套编钟作了测音和录音，并用这套编钟成功地演奏过“东方红”的曲子。据这个研究所的副研究员王世襄说：像这样保存了两千多年，而且奏出的音调还相当清晰优美的古代乐器，在世界上也是很少见到的。
    这座古墓是去年春天发现的。目前，古墓中的文物已全部运到郑州。文化部已从北京历史博物馆及湖南省调来一部分技术人员，准备将全部漆木器加以复制。中央新闻纪录电影制片厂也把这座墓的发掘情况和出土文物，拍摄成了新闻纪录片。（新华社记者　吕忠爽）
