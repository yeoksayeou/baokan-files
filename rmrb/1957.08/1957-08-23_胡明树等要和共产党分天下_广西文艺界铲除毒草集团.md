The anti-Party and anti-socialist alliance of right-wing elements in Guangxi's literary and art circles, including Hu Mingshu, Lin Huanping, and Li Wenzhao, who have been exposed, published reactionary articles in newspapers and periodicals such as "Wenhui Bao," "Wenyi Bao," and "Lijiang" during the "Great Blooming and Contending" period. They also planned to establish "Tongren Bao," attempting to use these activities to expand their ideological front, sing a "rival opera" against the Communist Party, and further achieve their political goal of "if we can't compete with the Communist Party for the world, we must at least divide the world with the Communist Party."

Hu Mingshu and Lin Huanping co-wrote "Those Who Hear Are Not Warned, Those Who Speak Are Punished," insisting that Guangxi suppressed the blooming and contending, not only was it "suddenly warm, then cold," but also "the spring breeze cannot blow over the Kunlun Pass" (a mountain near Nanning). When right-wing elements frantically attacked the Communist Party at the Guangxi Provincial Propaganda Work Conference, the Minister of Propaganda of the Nanning Municipal Party Committee suggested that the conference's shortcoming was that there was too much blooming and too little contending. Hu said that this proposal was "withdrawing before releasing," violating the central government's "blooming and contending" policy. They also blatantly promoted the bourgeois direction of "Wenhui Bao," disagreed with the criticism of Wenhui Bao, and slandered Guangxi Daily for not taking the bourgeois direction as a "mistake."

After the Guangxi Provincial Propaganda Work Conference, Lin Huanping summarized three "experiences" and published them in an internal publication of the China Democratic League. These three "experiences" were: First, we must change the past dependence on the Party. In the past, we always "acted according to the Party's intentions," and "did whatever the Party told us to do," but we can't do that anymore; Second, it is best for democratic parties to unite to carry out work, and the strength will be greater; Third, we must "improve political sensitivity." In fact, what he meant by "political sensitivity" was to "probe the direction" and seize the opportunity to attack.

The Guangxi literary and art circles have held meetings for days to give a forceful critique of Hu Mingshu and others' reactionary articles.

Hu Mingshu and others' hatred for the Communist Party and socialism has historical roots. According to revelations from recent symposiums in the provincial literary and art circles, Hu Mingshu followed the cultural spy Hu Weizhou, served as the editor of the supplement of "Yan Bao" run by Li Zongren's wife, Guo Dejie, colluded with Hu Feng, shed tears for landlords during the land reform, and mourned the great secret agent Jiang Yuanqin. Lin Huanping used to participate in the Communist Party, but later wavered in his revolution, betrayed the Party and defected to Yan Xishan, and served as the president of the National Revolutionary News Agency run by Yan's brother-in-law, Liang Yanwu. Li Wenzhao is a Trotskyist who abandoned the Party, a relative of Li Zongren, and served in various official positions under Li Zongren, touting and promoting Greater Guangxi-ism for the Gui Clique warlords.

### 胡明树等要和共产党分天下　广西文艺界铲除毒草集团

    胡明树等要和共产党分天下
　　广西文艺界铲除毒草集团
    本报特约新华社稿　已被揭发的广西省文艺界反党、反社会主义联盟右派分子胡明树、林焕平、李文钊等人，在“大鸣大放”期间曾连续在“文汇报”、“文艺报”、“漓江”等报刊上发表反动文章，并筹办“同人报”，企图用这些活动来扩大思想阵地，同共产党唱“对台戏”，进一步达到“不能和共产党争天下，起码也要和共产党分天下”的政治目的。
    胡明树、林焕平合写的“闻者不戒，言者有罪”，硬说广西压制鸣放，不仅“乍暖还寒”，而且是“春风吹不过昆仑关”（南宁附近的一座山）。当右派分子在广西省宣传工作会议上向共产党猖狂进攻的时候，中共南宁市委宣传部长提出大会的缺点是鸣得多，争得少。胡就说这主张是“欲放先收”，是违反中央的“鸣放”方针的。他们还明目张胆地宣扬“文汇报”的资产阶级方向，不同意对文汇报的批评，污蔑广西日报不走资产阶级方向是“错误”的。
    广西省宣传工作会议后，林焕平总结了三条“经验”，并发表在民盟内部刊物上。这三条“经验”是：一、必须改变过去对党的依赖思想，过去总是“按照党的意图办事”，“党交代做就做”，现在不能再这样了；二、民主党派最好联合起来进行工作，力量就更大些；三、要“提高政治敏感性”。其实他所说的“政治敏感性”就是“窥测方向”伺机出击。
    胡明树等的反动文章，广西文艺界连日举行的会议上已给予有力的批判。
    胡明树等人的对共产党对社会主义的憎恨，是有历史根源的。据最近省文艺界座谈会的揭露，胡明树跟随过文化特务胡危舟，任过李宗仁妻子郭德洁所办的“言报”副刊编辑，和胡风勾搭过，土地改革时为地主流过泪，悼念过大特务姜元钦。林焕平过去曾经参加过共产党，后因对革命发生动摇，叛党投靠阎锡山，并任过阎的妹夫梁延武办的民族革命通讯社社长。李文钊是个脱党的托派分子，是李宗仁的亲戚，在李宗仁手下做过多种官，为桂系军阀吹嘘宣传过大广西主义。
