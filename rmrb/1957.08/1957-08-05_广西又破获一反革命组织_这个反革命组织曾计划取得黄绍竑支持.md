Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Nanning, Guangxi - Public security organs in Nanning City, Guangxi Province, recently uncovered a counter-revolutionary organization – the “China Zhihe Party.” The principal figures of this counter-revolutionary organization, Huang Hantao (alias Peng Pai), Lu Zhaoquan (alias Bowen), and others have all been arrested, and numerous pieces of incriminating evidence have been seized.

This counter-revolutionary organization planned to develop the “Guangxi Freedom Force” reactionary armed force, with plans to expand to 30,000 people within two years.

When bourgeois rightists in various regions were madly launching attacks on the Party and the people, these counter-revolutionary elements thought "the time had come" and became even more rampant. They also planned to go to Beijing, Guangzhou, and other places to seek support from rightists such as Huang Shaohong.

The principal members of this counter-revolutionary organization were landlords, individuals who had undergone labor reform, bad elements purged from state organs and enterprises, and hooligans and thieves. On July 24, the day before they were to convene a “Party Representative Congress” in the suburbs of Nanning City, our public security personnel, with the assistance of local people, smashed this counter-revolutionary organization.

    这个反革命组织曾计划取得黄绍竑支持
    新华社讯　广西省南宁市公安机关最近破获了一个反革命组织——“中国志和党”。这个反革命组织的首要分子黄翰高（化名澎湃）、陆兆权（化名博文）等已全部落网，并查获罪证多件。
    这个反革命组织计划发展“广西自由队”反动武装，计划在两年内发展三万人。
    当各地资产阶级右派分子疯狂向党向人民发动进攻的时候，这些反革命分子以为“时机已到”，更加猖狂。他们还计划到北京、广州等地找右派分子黄绍竑等人支持。
    这个反革命组织的首要分子都是地主、经过劳动改造的分子、被国家机关、企业清洗的坏分子及流氓、盗窃分子等。7月24日，当他们准备在南宁市郊区召开“党员代表大会”的前一天，我公安工作人员在当地群众的协助下破获了这个反革命组织。
