    A Carbuncle in the Depths of the Soul
　　Ai Wu
    Ding Ling said to Comrade Xu Guangping: "No matter how much work you do now, what does it count for? Writing is what truly belongs to oneself." This shows that in the depths of Ding Ling's soul, there is something dirty and bourgeois hidden. And this dirty thing, like a carbuncle, has taken root there, festering and corroding her thoughts and feelings.
    A Communist Party writer should devote all their energy to writing for the workers, peasants, and all working people, and dedicate what they write to them, allowing it to become their shared cultural property, from which they can draw encouragement and be warned. Chairman Mao, in his speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, said that literature and art should become a component part of the entire revolutionary machine. This means that what a writer writes should not become their own.
    Ding Ling is a veteran Communist Party writer, and it's not that she doesn't understand these principles, it's just that in the depths of her soul, there is still something dirty and bourgeois hidden. It has been lurking there ever since she wrote "Miss Sophia's Diary." That is extreme individual hedonism, endlessly elevating oneself, endlessly indulging oneself. This is a mental illness produced by the combination of the declining landlord class and the corrupt comprador bourgeoisie. Ding Ling has been deeply poisoned by this toxin, and it has grown into a carbuncle. Even if she throws herself into the revolutionary tide, if she doesn't resolutely dig out this carbuncle and thoroughly and cleanly cut it off and throw it away, big problems will occur. When she was engaged in revolution in Shanghai, she had a bourgeois-style romantic love affair. After being arrested, she betrayed the Party in Nanjing. In Yan'an, she published Wang Shiwei's counter-revolutionary "Wild Lily" and wrote her own anti-Party "Thoughts on March 8th." These are not accidental manifestations, but rather larger festerings of the carbuncle in the depths of her soul. Her statement to Xu Guangping, "What is written is truly one's own," is precisely because she was dizzy with victory, carried away with success, and revealed her true heartfelt words. It is to regard the work as a tool to elevate oneself and a magic weapon to achieve self-indulgence. If you think she is an old Communist Party writer, you will be greatly surprised. But if you understand that in the depths of her soul, there is a carbuncle of extreme individual hedonism, you will find it the most natural thing in the world.
    Because she sees what she writes as her own, and can use it to elevate herself and increase her own honor, others cannot criticize it, only praise is allowed, no criticism. Praise increases honor and puts gold on her body; criticism damages honor and puts dung on her head. If Ding Ling sincerely recognizes in her heart that the works she writes are dedicated to the workers, peasants, and all working people, for them to share, then what's wrong with someone criticizing them? Because since it is dedicated to the workers, peasants, and all working people, listening to their opinions, whether what is written is beneficial or harmful to them, and using it to improve one's own work, wouldn't that be great? Unfortunately, Ding Ling does not have these thoughts in her heart.
    She sees what she writes as her own, and does not see it as a cog in the revolutionary machine; the difference lies here. She believes that creation is her own career, so of course she can only guide herself and cannot accept the Party's leadership. If she believed that this was part of the Party's cause, then she would have to listen to the Party's instructions and implement the Party's policies, so that the effect produced by the work among the masses could be seamlessly aligned with the Party's fundamental spirit and general policies. Precisely because she does not consider this a part of the Party's cause, and even fails to see that writers cannot create works without the society created by the working people. Therefore, the more works there are, or the more they are valued, the more it will inevitably lead to extreme pride. Ding Ling won the Stalin Prize, which went to her head. She arrogantly looked down on everything, did not take the Party organization that led her seriously, often opposed the Party organization, endlessly expanded herself, and wanted a group of people to surround her and listen to their flattering words to make herself enjoy herself. A Communist Party writer who has reached this point can be said to have reached the height of baseness.
    This expanded meeting of the Party Group of the Writers Association is to ask Ding Ling to open her heart, completely expose the carbuncle in the depths of her soul, as well as the anti-Party things she has done due to the festering of this carbuncle, so that major surgery can be performed to thoroughly and cleanly remove it, allowing Ding Ling to be a new person and honestly write beneficial works for the workers, peasants, and all working people. This is an extremely good thing for Ding Ling. Ding Ling, I advise you, don't cherish the carbuncle anymore!

    灵魂深处的毒瘤
　　艾芜
    丁玲对许广平同志说：“你现在不管做多少工作，都算得什么呢？写东西才是自己的。”这表现了丁玲灵魂深处，藏有资产阶级肮脏的东西。而这肮脏东西，却像毒瘤似的生根在那里，日益溃烂，腐蚀了她的思想和感情。
    一个党员作家，应该是竭尽毕生的精力，为工人农民及一切劳动人民写作，而把写出的东西，献给他们，让它成为他们共有的文化财产，从那里面得到鼓舞的力量和引为警惕的东西。毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上讲话，说文艺是应该成为整个革命机器的一个组成部分。就是说明作家写出的东西，不应成为自己的。
    丁玲是个老党员作家，并不是不懂得这些道理，只是她灵魂深处，还藏有资产阶级的肮脏东西。从她写的“莎菲女士的日记”起，一直就蕴藏着的。那就是极端的个人享乐主义，无限制地抬高自己，无限制地让自己享乐。这是没落的地主阶级和腐朽的买办资产阶级，共同结合，产生下的一种精神病态的产物。丁玲深深中了这种毒素，而且长成毒瘤，即使投身在革命浪潮中，若不痛下决心，挖出这种毒瘤，彻底干净地割下抛去，也是会发生大毛病的。她在上海从事革命时发生过资产阶级式的浪漫恋爱。被捕后，在南京变节，叛变了党。在延安发表王实味反革命的“野百合花”，和自己写出反党的“三八节有感”。解放后又在北京搞反党小集团。这些都不是偶然的表现，而是她那灵魂深处的毒瘤，几次更大的溃烂罢了。她向许广平同志说出“写出的东西才是自己的”，正是胜利冲昏了头脑，得意忘形，吐露了她的真实的肺腑之言。就是要把作品当成抬高自己的工具，达到能够使自己享乐的法宝。如果你认为她是老的党员作家，你会大吃一惊的。但你要明白她的灵魂深处，生有极端个人享受主义的毒瘤，就觉得那是再自然没有的了。
    由于她把写的东西看成自己的，可以借此抬高自己，增加自己的荣誉，因而别人就批评不得，只许说好，不许说坏。说好，增加了荣誉，身上贴了金；说坏，损坏了荣誉，头上着了粪。假如丁玲从心里真诚地认识到自己写出的作品，是献给工人农民及一切劳动人民，让他们公有，那么，有人来批评又有什么不好呢？因为既然献给工人农民及一切劳动人民，听听他们的意见，到底写出的东西，对他们有益或有害，借以改进自己的工作，岂不很好。可惜丁玲在她心里是不存在这些想法的。
    她把写的东西看成自己的，而不认为是革命机器中的一颗螺丝钉，分歧就在这里；认为创作是自己的事业，当然只有自己指导自己，接受不了党的领导；如果认为这是党的事业的一部分，那就得听候党的吩咐，执行党的政策，使作品在群众中产生的效果，能够和党的根本精神和大政方针吻合无间。正由于不认为这是党的一部分事业，更没有看见作家离开了劳动人民所创造的社会是写不出作品的。因此作品越多，或者越受人重视，就不能不产生极大的骄傲。丁玲得了斯大林奖金，冲昏了头脑，岸然傲视一切，把领导她的党组织，不放在眼里，常常和党组织闹对立，无限制地扩张自己，要使一群人围绕在周围，听他们说奉承话来使自己享乐。一个党员作家走到这步田地，可以说卑鄙到了极点。
    这次作协党组扩大会议，就是要丁玲坦开肺腑，把灵魂深处的毒瘤，以及由于这个毒瘤的溃烂，还做了什么反党的事情，完全暴露出来，好施大手术，把它彻底干净地割掉，使丁玲重新作人，老老实实为工人农民及一切劳动人民写出有益的作品。这对丁玲说来，是件极好的事情。丁玲，我劝告你，再不要爱惜毒瘤了！
