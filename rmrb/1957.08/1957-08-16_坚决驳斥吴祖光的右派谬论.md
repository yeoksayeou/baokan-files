Resolutely Refute Wu Zuguang's Rightist Fallacies
    Mei Lanfang

    Wu Zuguang's descent into becoming a rightist element who opposes the Party, the people, and socialism is, at first hearing, indeed surprising. However, after reading some of the absurd and reactionary statements he has publicly made, and some of the reactionary words and deeds he has engaged in behind the scenes as exposed by some comrades, it is not surprising at all.

    Wu Zuguang's utterly arbitrary obliteration of the work achievements of various departments in the eight years since liberation, and his malicious exaggeration and even fabrication of individual shortcomings in the work to attack the Party, is precisely to achieve the goal of abolishing the Party's leadership.

    He viciously attacks the organizational system, saying that "organization and the individual are opposed, and the greater the organizational power, the less the individual power." We must ask: Are organization and the individual opposed? Of course not. Not only are they not opposed, but they are also unified. We must ask: Does greater organizational power reduce individual power? Our answer is quite the opposite. The greater the organizational power, the more fully individual power can be brought into play. In order to demoralize people, win over the masses, overthrow the Party's leadership, and abolish the socialist system, rightist elements have released poisoned arrows preaching that they only want freedom and not discipline, only democracy and not centralism, only individual action and not unified will. They take advantage of some of the individualistic and liberalistic weaknesses in the thinking of our literary and art circles and intellectuals, excessively emphasize the characteristics of literature and art, and incite everyone to take the so-called "individual struggle" path, which will inevitably lead to separation from the collective, separation from the socialist path, and separation from the Party's leadership. This kind of conspiracy is extremely vicious, and we see it very clearly.

    Let's take a look at how Wu Zuguang attacks the state's organizational system. He said: "Our truly senior, and some elderly professional literary and art workers, artists who can be called experts, have, as a result of long-term 'reliance on organization,' been brutally suppressed and interfered with for a long time; they are cautious, full of worries, tight-lipped, and unable to move an inch; not to mention being incomparable to the Young Pioneers with their red scarves, they are even more helpless than babies in nurseries, and have lost the ability to live independently." He also said: "Many outstanding veteran artists who should belong to the country's treasures have been deprived of the right to survive on the stage in such a long period of time, living in poverty and shedding tears of old age." There are many, many of his fallacies, and I will not list them one by one. I just want to ask everyone to pay attention here, he is talking about the new China, the new society, not the old China, the old society. If he hasn't drunk too much, how could he reverse black and white and confuse right and wrong like this? It's really infuriating and funny. The "truly senior and some elderly professional literary and art workers, artists who can be called experts" and "many outstanding veteran artists who should belong to the country's treasures" he mentioned, of course, include the Peking Opera circle! But when have we been like he said, "tight-lipped and unable to move an inch"? When have we been like he said, "living in poverty and shedding tears of old age"? Such days did exist, but that was in the old China, the old society, not in the new China, the new society. Since liberation, we have, as people's representatives, freely discussed state affairs in the country's highest organs of power, eloquently and without reservation. Is this "tight-lipped"? Since liberation, we, as actors, have not only traveled all over the country, but also, as cultural envoys of the country, traveled far across the ocean to perform abroad. Under the close care of the Party and the government, we have received a warm welcome from the broad masses of people at home and abroad. Is this "unable to move an inch"? Since liberation, many accomplished artists have been respected and cared for by the Party and the government under certain conditions, and have been given the opportunity to serve the people. Everyone feels happy in body and mind, and smiles with joy. Why does Wu Zuguang say that they are "living in poverty and shedding tears of old age"? We Peking Opera colleagues absolutely cannot tolerate this kind of slander with ulterior motives.

    Wu Zuguang scolds the cadres of opera reform, saying that they "do more harm than good," obliterating the work achievements of the comrades. This is extremely wrong. Based on my personal experience, because the Party and the government respect the tradition of opera and develop the art of opera, and have invested great efforts to participate in and lead the work of opera, these comrades, in close cooperation with the artists, have made significant contributions to the vigorous development of opera art. Although some shortcomings have occurred due to lack of experience, the leadership has been correcting them in a timely manner. In short, their achievements are fundamental and cannot be obliterated. Wu Zuguang's slander is groundless.

    Wu Zuguang, like other rightist elements, attempts to overthrow the Party's leadership, but I and our literary and art colleagues absolutely need the Party's leadership! As far as the opera circle is concerned, because of the Party's leadership, artists have gained true liberation, and because of the Party's leadership, opera art has achieved vigorous development. Can we say that the flourishing of more than three hundred kinds of opera after liberation is not an unprecedented miracle? Can we say that the emergence of more than two hundred thousand opera troupes and talented people after liberation is not the result of the Party's leadership? Now, due to the rumors and demagoguery of the rightist elements, a kind of tune that the present is not as good as the past and the new is not as good as the old is prevailing in the literary and art circles. This tendency of only looking backward and not forward expresses a kind of regressive and declining emotion, and lacks a correct understanding and firm confidence in the great socialist era. In fact, the current opera art, whether Peking Opera or other brotherly opera genres, has developed greatly compared to any dynasty in the past. Our scripts and performing arts are richer and improved than in the past. This is an extremely common phenomenon, and examples are too numerous to mention. As for myself: Some people say, "Mei Lanfang's art is constantly developing." I think this statement is correct. I feel that my art has new developments. Every program I perform regularly has been enriched in terms of script and performance. I am over sixty years old, and I am still able to work happily on the stage. I feel younger, isn't this what the Party's leadership has given me? Doesn't this show the superiority of the socialist system? The era of "living in poverty and shedding tears of old age" is long gone. Let us wholeheartedly cheer for the happiness of the new era and cheer for an even more beautiful future!

    Rightist elements clamor that "laymen cannot lead experts," and the so-called "professionals leading professionals" is also a poisoned arrow aimed at abolishing the Party's leadership and excluding new literary and art workers from participating in opera work. I believe that the vast majority of the current leading comrades in the literary and art circles are experts, because the country's socialist construction requires socialist literature and art. The so-called "layman" is not necessarily a layman, and the so-called "expert" is not necessarily an expert. There is a distinction between expert and layman in art, but we oppose that kind of narrow and vulgar understanding. Comrades, please think, if those who sing painted faces must be led by those who sing painted faces, and those who sing female roles must be led by those who sing female roles, wouldn't that be very ridiculous? We must expose the conspiracies and tricks of the rightist elements to sabotage the socialist cause, and unite closely under the leadership of the Party.

    Finally, I would also like to say a few words to Wu Zuguang. During the filming of my stage life documentary, I had a short period of cooperation with him. I felt that Wu Zuguang has petty cleverness, but no great wisdom. Judging from his anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds, he doesn't even understand the principles of social development. He doesn't even understand how to be a human being in the new society, and he doesn't even understand what is meant by the people's standpoint and the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint. Can this be called great wisdom? The reason why he has fallen to this point is precisely because he has consistently been sitting in a well and looking at the sky, arrogant, conceited, and self-righteous, and the result is that he has been misled by his own cleverness. If he stood on the people's standpoint, he could do some things for the people, but he did not do so, but instead became a spokesman for the rightists. I hate his self-abandonment, and I also regret his talent.

    Some people have revealed that Wu Zuguang has also said some bad things about me behind my back. He said that I, "demanded high remuneration from the Ministry of Culture for filming the movie." I really don't know what he means by saying this. The state uses film to record my stage life, and its purpose is to meet the needs of the people and expand the influence of art. I was very moved. I personally never thought that the state would give me any remuneration, but the state, according to the principle of distribution according to work, actually sent me generous remuneration. I felt ashamed to accept it, but I have never "demanded" any "high remuneration" from the Ministry of Culture. Wu Zuguang's groundless nonsense is really outrageous!

    The Party and the people give all rightist elements the opportunity to confess their crimes and reform. "If you realize your mistake and return, the shore is at hand." I hope Wu Zuguang can strive for his own future to be a new person!

    坚决驳斥吴祖光的右派谬论
    梅兰芳
    吴祖光堕落成为反党反人民反社会主义的右派分子，乍听起来，的确令人感到惊讶，但是，看了他公开发表的一些荒谬绝伦的反动言论，和有些同志揭发出来的他在背后的种种反动言行，那就丝毫也不奇怪了。
    吴祖光之所以从各个方面极其武断地抹煞解放八年来各部门的工作成绩，把工作中的个别缺点，恶意地夸大渲染、甚至无中生有向党进攻，就是为了要达到取消党的领导的目的。
    他恶毒地攻击组织制度，说什么“组织和个人是对立的，组织力量庞大，个人力量就减少”，我们要问：组织和个人是对立的吗？当然不是，不但不是对立的，而且是统一的。我们要问：组织力量庞大，个人力量就减少吗？我们的回答，也是恰恰相反，组织力量越大，个人力量才会得到充分发挥。右派分子为了涣散人心，拉拢群众，推翻党的领导，取消社会主义制度，放出了只要自由，不要纪律，只要民主，不要集中，只要个人行动，不要统一意志的毒箭。他们利用我们文艺界和知识分子思想上存在的一些个人主义、自由主义的弱点，过分强调文艺的特点，煽动大家走所谓“个人奋斗”的道路，其结果必然脱离集体，脱离社会主义的道路，脱离党的领导。这种阴谋是非常毒辣的，我们看得十分清楚。
    我们来看看吴祖光是怎样来攻击国家的组织制度呢？他说：“我们真正的年长的，以及年老的某些专业文艺工作者，堪称为专家的艺术家们；却由于长期的‘依靠组织’的结果长期地被粗暴压制和干涉的结果；小心翼翼，顾虑重重，金人缄口，寸步难行；不要说难以比拟带着红领巾的小学生，比保育院的婴儿还要难以自处，失去了独立生活的能力。”他又说：“许多应当是属于国家的宝贝的优秀的前辈艺术家，在这样悠长的岁月里，却就是因此被剥夺了在舞台生存的权利，穷愁潦倒，老泪纵横。”他的谬论很多很多，我不一一列举了，我只想在这里请大家注意，他上面说的是新中国、新社会，不是说旧中国、旧社会。他如果不是喝酒过了量，怎么会这样颠倒黑白，混淆是非呢？真是叫人又好气，又好笑。他所说的：“真正的年长的以及老年的某些专业文艺工作者，堪称为专家的艺术家们”和“许多应当是属于国家的宝贝的优秀的前辈艺术家”，当然也包括京剧界在内吧！但是我们什么时候像他说的那样
  “金人缄口，寸步难行”呢？我们什么时候像他说的那样“穷愁潦倒，老泪纵横”呢？这种日子曾经有过的，那是在旧中国、旧社会，不是在新中国、新社会。解放以来，我们以人民代表的身份，在国家的最高的权力机构，畅议国事，侃侃而谈，难道这是“金人缄口”吗？解放以来，我们以演员身份不但走遍全国，而且作为国家的文化使节，远渡重洋，出国演出，在党和政府的亲切关怀之下，受到了国内外广大人民的热烈欢迎，难道这是“寸步难行”吗？解放以来，许多有成就的艺术家，都在一定条件下，受到党和政府的尊重和关怀，得到为人民服务的机会，大家都感到心身愉快、喜笑颜开，而吴祖光为什么说成是“穷愁潦倒，老泪纵横”呢？这种别有用心的诬蔑，我们京剧界的同行们是绝对不能容忍的。
    吴祖光谩骂戏曲改革的干部，说是“成事不足、败事有余”，抹煞了同志们的工作成绩，这是极端错误的。根据我的亲身体验，由于党和政府尊重戏曲传统、发展戏曲艺术，投入了很大力量参加和领导戏曲工作，这些同志在艺人的亲密合作之下，对于戏曲艺术的蓬勃发展做了重大贡献。虽然由于经验不足，也曾发生过某些缺点，但是，领导方面，都在及时纠正。总之他们的成绩是基本的，是不容抹煞的，吴祖光的毁谤是毫无根据的。
    吴祖光和其他右派分子一样，企图推翻党的领导，但是我和我们文艺界的同行，却绝对需要党的领导！就戏曲界来说，因为有了党的领导，艺人才得到了真正的解放，因为有了党的领导，戏曲艺术才得到了蓬勃的发展，我们能够说解放后三百多种戏曲，百花齐放，不是亘古没有的奇迹吗？我们能够说解放后涌现了二十几万的戏曲队伍，人才辈出，不是党领导的效果吗？现在由于右派分子的造谣惑众，在文艺界流行着一种今不如昔，新不如旧的滥调，这种专往后看，不往前看的倾向，是表现了一种倒退没落的情绪，对于社会主义伟大的时代，缺乏正确的认识和坚强的信心。事实上，现在的戏曲艺术，无论京剧或者其他兄弟剧种，比过去任何一个朝代，都是大大地发展了，我们的剧本和表演艺术比过去都丰富和提高了，这是极其普遍的现象，例子是举不胜举的。以我个人来讲：有人说：“梅兰芳的艺术，还在不断发展”，我认为这种说法是对的，我觉得我的艺术有新的发展，我经常演出的每个节目，从剧本到表演都有所丰富，我已经六十多岁了，现在还能够在舞台上愉快地工作着，我感到自己更年轻了，这难道不是党的领导所给予的吗？这难道不是表现了社会主义制度的优越性吗？“穷愁潦倒，老泪纵横”的时代早已一去不复返了，我们衷心地为新时代的幸福而欢呼，为更加美丽的未来而欢呼吧！
    右派分子叫嚣“外行不能领导内行”，所谓“本行领导本行”的论调，也是想取消党的领导，排斥新文艺工作者参加戏曲工作的毒箭。我认为目前文艺界一些领导同志，绝大多数都是内行，因为国家的社会主义建设，要办社会主义的文学和艺术，所谓“外行”就不一定是外行，所谓“内行”也未必一定是内行，在艺术上是有内行、外行之分的，但是我们反对那种狭隘的庸俗化的理解。同志们请想，如果唱花脸的必须唱花脸的来领导，唱旦角的必须唱旦角的来领导，这不是很可笑的事吗？我们必须戳穿右派分子破坏社会主义事业的阴谋诡计，在党的领导下，亲密团结起来。
    最后我还要对吴祖光说几句话，在拍摄我的舞台生活纪录片的工作中，我和他曾有一个短时期的合作，我感到吴祖光有小聪明，没有大聪明，从他反党反社会主义的言行看来，他连社会发展的道理都不懂得，他连在新社会如何做人的道理都不懂得，连什么叫人民的立场，马列主义的观点都不懂得，这能说是大聪明吗？他所以堕落到这种地步，正是由于一贯地坐井观天、夜郎自大、目空一切、自作聪明，结果是聪明反被聪明误。他如果站在人民的立场，是可以为人民做些事情的，但是他没有这样做，反而做了右派的发言人，我痛恨他的自暴自弃，又可惜他的才华。
    有人揭发吴祖光在背后还说了我一些坏话，他说我，“拍电影向文化部索取高额酬金”，我真不知道他这样说是什么意思，国家用电影纪录我的舞台生活，其目的在于满足人民的需要，扩大艺术的影响，我很受感动，我个人根本没有想到国家给我任何报酬，但是国家根据按劳取酬的原则，竟给我送来了优厚的酬金，我感到受之有愧，但是我却从来没有向文化部“索取”过什么“高额酬金”。吴祖光无中生有地胡说，真是岂有此理！
    党和人民是给一切右派分子认罪自新的机会的，“迷途知返，回头是岸”，希望吴祖光能争取自己重新做人的前途！
