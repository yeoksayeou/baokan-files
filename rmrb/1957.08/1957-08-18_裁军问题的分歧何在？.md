Where Lies the Disagreement on the Disarmament Issue?
Weng Zuyao

The United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee meeting in London, which has attracted worldwide attention, has been going on for five months since mid-March. However, due to the obstruction of Western countries, the London Disarmament Conference has not yet reached any agreement on important issues.

The Soviet Union has long put forward a series of practical and feasible proposals; while the proposals of Western countries have not yet been fully presented. There is a fundamental divergence between the two proposals, reflecting the struggle between two different lines.

Stopping Nuclear Weapons Testing

The immediate cessation of atomic and hydrogen bomb tests is the most urgent demand of people of all countries. The Soviet Union not only advocates an immediate cessation of testing, but has also consistently insisted on the complete prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons. In view of the urgency of stopping nuclear weapons tests and the greater possibility of reaching an agreement, the Soviet Union proposed that this issue be separated from the overall disarmament issue and resolved separately. However, the United States and Britain have been looking for various excuses to refuse to accept the Soviet proposal.

Taking into account the attitude of Western countries, in order to solve this problem that threatens the safety of all mankind more quickly, Soviet representative Zorin made a new and major effort at the meeting on June 14, suggesting that countries possessing nuclear weapons temporarily suspend nuclear weapons explosions for at least two or three years, and suggesting that monitoring stations be established in the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and the Pacific to conduct international monitoring of the temporary cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapons tests.

Western countries had to put forward their proposals, admitting that it is now "possible" to achieve a temporary cessation of nuclear weapons tests, but said that an agreement must first be reached on the following four issues. These four issues are: (1) the duration of the cessation of testing and when it should begin; (2) the issue of supervising the cessation of testing; (3) the relationship between the cessation of testing and other provisions of the first stage of disarmament (such as the reduction of conventional armaments); and (4) the issue of linking the cessation of testing with the cessation of production of fissile materials used to manufacture nuclear weapons.

US representative Stassen said that he could only agree to a ten-month suspension of testing. This time limit just happens to be the preparation period for the next test and is of course meaningless. The Western countries also want to add many preconditions that will cause endless disputes, which further shows that they are not even sincere about a temporary suspension of testing.

Reducing Atomic Armaments

Regarding the issue of reducing atomic armaments, the Soviet Union's consistent position has been very clear, that is, to completely prohibit atomic weapons and eliminate such weapons from the armaments of all countries. However, Western countries have stubbornly refused the Soviet Union's proposal.

The Soviet Union recently suggested that: in the first stage of disarmament, all countries should cease testing atomic weapons and solemnly pledge not to use these weapons; in the second stage of disarmament, all countries should guarantee not to use these weapons, and cease production and destroy these weapons.

What is the United States' attitude towards this issue? Stassen said that the United States is not prepared to undertake the obligation to prohibit the use of atomic weapons together with other countries. He said that the United States is only willing to stop the production of atomic weapons under international supervision and transfer part of the nuclear military stockpile to peaceful uses. However, Stassen admitted that this approach he proposed would in fact still allow the countries concerned to possess a considerable number of nuclear weapons, and that those countries that have already begun to manufacture atomic weapons can continue to complete these weapons. He also stated that even if everyone agrees to stop the production of atomic weapons, the United States will retain the right to improve these weapons, and the United States will also train the troops of other countries to use atomic weapons and store atomic weapons in these countries. The attitudes of Britain and Canada are the same as that of the United States. Isn't this attitude very frivolous?

Reducing Armed Forces

The Soviet Union not only has always advocated substantial reductions in armaments and armed forces, but has also unilaterally reduced its armed forces by 1.84 million people in the past year or so.

In order to bring the two sides closer, the Soviet Union agreed in its proposal for partial disarmament on April 30 that in the first stage of disarmament, the armed forces of the Soviet Union, the United States, and China would be reduced to 2.5 million people, and those of Britain and France to 750,000 people. At the same time, the Soviet Union suggested that the armed forces of the Soviet Union, the United States, and China should be further reduced to 1 million to 1.5 million people, and those of Britain and France to 650,000 people.

Western countries have also put forward their proposals, advocating that the reduction be carried out in three stages. In the first stage, the Soviet Union and the United States would be reduced to 2.5 million people, and Britain and France to 750,000 people; in the second stage, the Soviet Union and the United States to 2.1 million people, and Britain and France to 700,000 people; in the third stage, the Soviet Union and the United States to 1.7 million people, and Britain and France to 650,000 people; but whether the latter two stages are carried out depends on whether the world's "political problems are solved." This is actually equivalent to making further large-scale reductions in armed forces impossible.

Soviet representative Zorin recently stated that the Soviet Union is prepared to accept this reduction figure if it is not conditional on resolving major international political issues.

Aerial Inspection

In order to strive for an agreement on partial disarmament, the Soviet Union has taken new steps to move closer to the West on the issue of international supervision, expressing its willingness to use aerial photography as part of supervising the implementation of disarmament agreements.

Currently, the areas for aerial inspection proposed by the Soviet Union and the United States are as follows:

The Soviet Union proposed on April 30 that in Europe, the western boundary of the aerial inspection area should be the zero degree meridian, the eastern boundary should be 25 degrees east longitude, the northern boundary should be 54 degrees north latitude, and the southern boundary should be 39 degrees 38 minutes north latitude. In the Far East, the aerial inspection area includes Soviet territory east of 108 degrees east longitude and US territory west of 90 degrees west longitude. This makes the territory of the United States and the Soviet Union for aerial photography roughly equal, which is a fair and reasonable proposal.

US Secretary of State Dulles, on behalf of the four countries of the United States, Britain, France, and Canada, put forward a proposal on August 2, first suggesting that the entire Soviet Union, Canada, the continental United States, and Alaska (including the Aleutian Islands) be completely opened up as aerial inspection areas. If the Soviet Union does not agree to this proposal, then the four Western countries suggest establishing an inspection area in the Arctic region including parts of the Soviet Union, Canada, the United States, Denmark, and Norway. As for the issue of the European aerial inspection area, the four Western countries suggested that if any of the above suggestions are accepted, an inspection area should be established in Europe: south to 40 degrees north latitude, west to 10 degrees west longitude, and east to 60 degrees east longitude; if the Soviet Union rejects this suggestion, then consideration should be given to demarcating a more limited inspection area in Europe, but this area should include a considerable part of Soviet territory and the territory of Eastern European countries. None of the suggestions put forward by Dulles include the important military bases of the United States or Britain in Africa, the Near East, Japan, and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization countries, and the Arctic region has thousands of kilometers of uninhabited areas and there is no question of any military facilities there. Moreover, Western countries are trying to entangle the entire disarmament negotiation in this non-fundamental issue, so where is the sincerity of the West?

From the above facts, people can clearly see that the Soviet Union has made significant efforts in order to strive for an early agreement on even a partial agreement on disarmament issues. The responsibility for the failure to reach an agreement on the disarmament issue to date lies entirely with the Western countries.

### 裁军问题的分歧何在？

    裁军问题的分歧何在？
    翁祖尧
    举世瞩目的联合国裁军小组委员会伦敦会议，自3月中旬开始以来，到现在已经历时五个月了。可是，由于西方国家的阻挠，伦敦裁军会议至今还没有在重要问题上达成任何协议。
    苏联很早就提出了一系列切实可行的建议；而西方国家的建议则至今还没有提完。两种建议之间存在着根本性的分歧，反映了两条不同路线的斗争。
    停止核武器试验
    立即停止原子弹和氢弹试验，是当前各国人民最迫切的要求。苏联不仅主张立即停止试验，而且一贯坚持完全禁止原子武器和氢武器。鉴于停止核武器试验问题的迫切性和达成协议的较大可能性，苏联建议把这个问题从总的裁军问题里分出来，单独加以解决。但是美国和英国一直找寻各种借口，拒绝接受苏联的建议。
    考虑到西方国家的态度，为了更快地解决这一威胁到全人类安全的问题，苏联代表佐林在6月14日的会议上，又作了新的重大的努力，建议拥有核武器的国家至少在两三年内暂时停止核武器爆炸，并建议在苏、美、英三国和太平洋建立监督站，以便对暂时停止原子武器和氢武器试验进行国际监督。
    西方国家不得不提出了它们的建议，承认现在已经“有可能”实现暂时停止核武器试验，但又说必须以下列四个问题取得协议为先决条件。这四个问题是：（一）停止试验的时间久暂和从什么时候开始；（二）停止试验的监督问题；（三）停止试验和裁军的第一阶段的其他规定（例如裁减常规军备）之间的关系；（四）停止试验同停止生产用于制造核武器的裂变物质联系的问题。
    美国代表史塔生表示只能同意暂停试验十个月。这个期限，刚好成为下次试验的准备期，当然是毫无实际意义的。西方国家还要加上许多会引起无休止的争论的先决条件，更说明了它们连暂停试验也是没有诚意的。
    裁减原子军备
    关于裁减原子军备问题，苏联一贯的立场是非常鲜明的，那就是完全禁止原子武器并从各国的军备中取缔这种武器。可是，西方国家却一直顽固地拒绝苏联的这一建议。
    苏联最近就曾建议：在裁军的第一阶段，各国停止试验原子武器和郑重保证不使用这些武器；在裁军的第二阶段，各国保证不使用这些武器，并且停止生产以及销毁这些武器。
    美国对这个问题的态度怎样呢？史塔生表示美国不准备同其他国家一道承担禁止使用原子武器的义务。他说，美国只愿在国际监督下停止原子武器的生产和把一部分的原子核军事储备转用于和平用途。但是，史塔生承认，他提出的这个办法实际上仍然允许有关国家掌握相当数量的核武器，而那些已经开始制造原子武器的国家还可以继续完成这些武器。他还表示，即使大家协议停止生产原子武器，美国也要保留改进这些武器的权利，美国还要训练其他国家的军队使用原子武器和在这些国家存贮原子武器。英国和加拿大的态度同美国一样。这种态度不是十分儿戏吗？
    裁减武装部队
    苏联不仅一向主张大量裁减军备和武装部队，而且已经在近一年多内把自己的武装部队单方面裁减了一百八十四万人。
    为了使双方意见接近，苏联在4月30日的局部裁军建议里同意，在裁军的第一阶段把苏联、美国和中国的武装部队裁减到二百五十万人，英、法裁减到七十五万人。同时，苏联建议必须进一步裁减苏联、美国和中国的武装部队到一百万至一百五十万人，英、法裁减到六十五万人。
    西方国家也提出了它们的建议，主张分三个阶段进行裁减。第一阶段苏联和美国裁减到二百五十万人，英国和法国裁减到七十五万人；第二阶段苏、美二百一十万人，英、法七十万人；第三阶段苏、美一百七十万人，英、法六十五万人；但后两个阶段是否进行，要看世界的“政治问题是否解决”而定。这实际上就等于使进一步的大规模裁减武装部队成为不可能。
    苏联代表佐林最近表示，如果这一裁减数字不以解决重大的国际政治问题为条件的话，苏联准备接受它。
    空中视察
    为了争取在局部裁军问题上达成协议，苏联在国际监督问题上采取了新的步骤来向西方靠拢，表示愿意把空中摄影作为监督实施裁军协议的一个部分。
    目前，苏联和美国建议的空中视察地区如下：
    苏联4月30日建议，在欧洲，空中视察地区的西部应以经线零度为界，东部至东经二十五度，北部至北纬五十四度，南部至北纬三十九度三十八分。在远东，空中视察区包括东经一百零八度以东的苏联领土和西经九十度以西的美国领土。这样就使进行空中摄影的美国和苏联的领土大致相等，是公平合理的建议。
    美国国务卿杜勒斯在8月2日代表美、英、法、加四国提出了一项建议，首先建议全部开放苏联、加拿大、美国大陆和阿拉斯加（包括阿留申群岛）为空中视察区。如果苏联不同意这个建议，那么西方四国就建议建立包括苏联、加拿大、美国、丹麦和挪威的一部分领土在内的北极地带的视察区。至于欧洲的空中视察区问题，西方四国建议，如果上述任何一个建议被接受，就在欧洲建立这样一个视察区：南至北纬四十度、西至西经十度、东至东经六十度；如果苏联拒绝这个建议，那么就考虑在欧洲划定更加有限的视察区，但这个地区要包括相当大的一部分苏联领土以及东欧国家领土。杜勒斯提出的这些建议，没有一个包括美国或英国在非洲、近东、日本和东南亚条约组织国家中的重要军事基地，而北极地带数千公里不见人烟、根本谈不上有什么军事设施。而且，西方国家还企图把整个裁军谈判纠缠在这个不带根本性质的问题上，西方的诚意又在哪儿呢？
          ×   ×  ×
    从以上事实中，人们可以清楚地看到苏联为了力求早日就裁军问题达成即使是局部的协议，已经作了重大的努力。裁军问题至今未能达成协议，责任完全在西方国家。
