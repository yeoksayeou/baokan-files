Dried Corpses and Silks
Huang Wenkuan

At a construction site in Meihua Village, Dongshan, Guangzhou, at the end of last year, a joint tomb of Dai Jin, the Minister of Works of Nanjing during the Zhengde period of the Ming Dynasty, and his wife was discovered. The tomb was about four meters underground, surrounded by impermeable native mottled red soil. The outer layer of the tomb chamber was rammed with ash and sand, the second layer was constructed with sandstone strips, and the interior was filled with pine resin as thick as ten centimeters, encapsulating the coffins in the middle. When the coffins were opened, both corpses were found to have become dried corpses – embalmed corpses.

According to research by the medical community, no bacteria were found in the corpses, nor was there any antibacterial effect. However, both corpses had decayed to some extent, and the decay process stopped later. According to the research, it can be confirmed that the preservation of the corpses was due to the multiple layers of sealing, rather than due to "preservatives."

The corpses were placed in the coffins dressed in twenty or thirty layers of clothing. The inside and outside of the coffins were lacquered, and there was a wooden outer coffin, the inside and outside of which were also lacquered. The pine resin around the outer coffin was melted and poured while hot, solidifying into a single mass (estimated to be about 2000 pounds of pine resin). The ash and sand rammed around the stone chamber were very solid, and neither mud, water, nor air could penetrate.

Many crystals of "water and terpin hydrate" were found between the coffins and inside the coffins. This was the only drug discovered. It was determined that it was secreted from the wood of the coffins, not added artificially. Many parasite eggs, such as roundworms, ginger flukes, whipworms, and Clonorchis sinensis, were found in the large intestine of the corpses. The roundworm eggs were still intact, and cultivation attempts proved that they were not viable.

A large number of garments were found in this tomb, and great efforts were made to preserve them. However, due to a lack of experience in this work, some losses were inevitable. The cotton and linen clothing and fabrics unearthed were almost like new after washing. Although a large number of silk brocade clothes were somewhat damaged, they were generally preserved. Only some silk gauze and brocade were damaged. These brocades allowed us to see the beautiful styles of the "Guangduan" ("Guangdong Satin") sung by Qu Wengshan in his Bamboo Branch Poetry of the Thirteen Hongs: "Five-silk, eight-silk Guangduan is good, money and silver piled high in the Thirteen Hongs."

These silks looked very intact when they were discovered, and not to the point of "turning to ash upon exposure to air," but they were indeed "easily broken with a touch."

The experience gained from this restoration that is worth introducing to field archaeological workers is this: Initially, we thought that these layers of clothing were soaked in corpse fluids and should be immediately rinsed and disassembled in clean water to avoid adhesion and damage. This was wrong. Later, the facts proved that they should be allowed to dry in the shade first. Not only would they not stick together, but the silk would also become dry and hard, preventing it from breaking easily with a touch, making it easier to rinse piece by piece with clean water. This is because silk fibers are a type of keratin, and keratin that has been moist for a long time will swell and inevitably break easily with a touch.

The qilin badge on the qilin official robe worn by the deceased was backed with a page from an old wooden-block printed book. Although it was incomplete, the paper and handwriting were still good. The book in the tomb once again proved that there is still hope for preservation. Books soaked in water should be allowed to dry before they can be turned. If they still cannot be opened, steam them slightly over a pot of water, and they will be easier to open. This is well known. It has not yet been possible to test whether this method is effective for unearthed books. However, it can be said with certainty that wet books will inevitably be torn if they are opened while wet.

    干尸和丝织品
    黄文宽
    广州去年底在东山梅花村建筑工地发现了一座明正德年间下葬的明南京工部尚书戴缙夫妇的合葬墓。墓葬深入地下约四公尺，四周是不渗水的原生花斑红土。墓室建筑的外层用灰砂夯筑，第二层用砂岩的石条结砌，内用厚达十多公分的松香灌满了，把棺具包封在中间。棺椁打开以后，发现两具尸体都成了干尸——腊尸。
    经医学界研究的结果，尸体内未发现有细菌，亦无抑菌作用。但是两具尸体都曾经一度腐败过，腐败过程在后来才停止了。根据研究的结果可以肯定尸体保全是由于重重密封的原因，而不是由于“防腐剂”。
    尸体穿着二三十层衣服才放入棺里。棺的内外施漆，棺外木椁，椁的内外也施漆。椁外四周上下的松香是煮熔了乘热灌下，融结成了一片（统计用松香二十市担左右）。石室外上下四周的灰砂夯筑很坚实，泥、水和空气都不能侵入。
    棺椁之间和棺内发现了许多“水和萜二醇”的结晶，这是发现的唯一的药物。经判明这是由棺椁木质内分泌出来，而不是人工加入的。尸体大肠内发现许多蛔虫、姜片虫、鞭虫、华枝睪等寄生虫卵，蛔虫卵还很完整，经过试行培养，证明没有生命。
    这座墓里发现了大批服装，费了很大的努力总算保全了。但由于对这一工作没有经验，也不免损失了一部分。出土的棉麻质的衣服和布匹，清洗后简直像是新的一样。大批丝质的织花的绸缎衣服虽然有些破裂，也算保全了。只有部分丝质的纱绢和织锦却损坏了。这些织花的绸缎使我们看到屈翁山十三行竹枝词所歌唱的：“五丝八丝广缎好，钱银堆满十三行”的“广缎”的美丽式样了。（附图）
    这些丝织品在发现时看上去是很完好的，不至于“见风化灰”，但确是“一触即破”。
    从这次整理中得到的经验值得向田野考古工作同志介绍的是：我们初时以为这层层的衣服受了尸水的浸渍，要马上拿进清水里漂洗拆开，才免粘连损坏。这是错误的。后来事实证明了应该先行让它阴干了，不特不会粘连，而且丝质也干硬了不致一触即破，才好一件一件用清水漂洗。因为丝质的纤维是一种角质，长期潮湿的角质发涨必然会一触即破的。
    死者穿的麒麟补服的麒麟补子后面用一页木板旧书裱上，虽然是不完整的，但纸质和字迹还是好的。书在墓葬中又一次证明了还有希望保全。浸水的书籍要等候它干了才可以翻动，假如仍揭不开，拿到水锅上隔水用蒸汽蒸它一下，也会容易揭开，这是大家所知的。这个办法对出土书籍有没有效，还没有机会试过。不过可以肯定的说，湿了水的书乘湿翻揭必然是会破烂的。（附图片）
