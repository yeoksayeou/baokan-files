Xinhua News Agency report:

    Tianjin’s journalism circles continue to expose and criticize the reactionary words and deeds of bourgeois rightist elements within the journalism field.

    Sun Zhaoyan, the chief editor of Tianjin Evening News, and other rightist elements pursued bourgeois press freedom and opposed the Party's leadership over newspapers. They adopted an attitude of negating everything about the Party and the people's news undertaking. They said that Party newspapers have "serious dogmatism, always putting on a Party newspaper face," and "overemphasize guidance and ideology, lacking interest and human touch." They placed the Party spirit and the people's spirit of newspapers in opposition to each other. Xiao Di, the deputy chief editor of Tianjin Youth News, a rightist element wearing the cloak of a Communist Party member, said, "The sacred duty of a newspaper is to reflect the voice of the people and supervise the ruling power." He also said, "Tianjin Daily is the organ of the Municipal Party Committee, Tianjin Workers' Daily is the organ of the Federation of Trade Unions, and our Youth News is also the organ of the Communist Youth League, and Tianjin Farmers' Daily is also the organ of the Rural Work Department. If they are all like this, then the people’s voices can’t be published." Jiang Hanqing, a rightist element in Tianjin Daily, also said, "If we only speak for the Municipal Party Committee and not for the people, we will inevitably become detached from the masses." Someone in Tianjin Workers' Daily also advocated: "Cancel the sign that Tianjin Workers' Daily is the organ of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions."

    During the period of great blooming and contending in Tianjin, Xiao Di, fearing that the world would not be in chaos, successively instructed reporters to organize "blooming" and "contending" forums in song and dance troupes, drama troupes, medical circles, Quyi circles, opera schools, engineering and technical circles, and apprentice workers to ignite the situation. Sun Zhaoyan used Tianjin Evening News to "stir up wind and rain" and "ignite the grassroots." These rightist elements advocated opposing the Party's leadership within the newspaper, luring some people to seize the Party's leadership over the newspaper. Lu Guangye and other rightist elements at the Tianjin People's Broadcasting Station even colluded with bad elements to form a so-called "backward branch." They proposed three major programs: (1) never join the Communist Party in their lives; (2) not hoping to be promoted; (3) not being afraid of losing their heads.

    The reactionary words and deeds of Xiao Di, Sun Zhaoyan, and other rightist elements aroused the boundless anger of Tianjin's journalists. Many people firmly stated that they must fight these rightist elements to the end.

    天津新闻界决心同右派分子斗争到底
    据新华社讯　天津市新闻界继续在揭露和批判新闻界资产阶级右派分子的反动言行。
    天津新晚报总编室主任孙肇延等右派分子追求资产阶级的新闻自由，反对党对报纸的领导。对党和人民的新闻事业采取否定一切的态度。他们说党报“教条主义严重，老是摆着党报面孔”、“过分强调指导性、思想性，缺乏趣味性，没有人情味”。他们把报纸的党性和人民性对立起来。天津青年报副总编辑、披着共产党员外衣的右派分子肖荻说：“报社的天职是反映人民的声音，监督执政者。”他又说：“天津日报是市委机关报，天津工人日报是工会机关报，我们青年报又是团的机关报，天津农民报也是农村工作部的机关报，如果都是这样，反映群众的呼声不能见报了。”天津日报右派分子江汗清也说：“如果我们只替市委说话，不替人民说话的话，势必脱离群众。”天津工人日报也有人主张：“取消工人日报是市工会联合会机关报的招牌”。
    肖荻在天津市大鸣大放期间，唯恐天下不乱，曾陆续指使记者在歌舞团、话剧团、医务界、曲艺界、戏曲学校、工程技术界、徒工中组织“鸣”“放”座谈会，进行点火。孙肇延则利用天津新晚报“呼风唤雨”、“点火于基层”。这些右派分子在报社内鼓吹反对党的领导，拉拢一部分人，企图夺取报社党的领导权。天津市人民广播电台右派分子路广业等竟纠合坏分子组成所谓“落后支部”。提出三大纲领：（一）一辈子不加入共产党；（二）不希望提拔；（三）不怕抛脑袋。
    肖荻、孙肇延等右派分子的反动言行，激起了天津市新闻工作者的无比愤怒，许多人坚决表示：一定要和这批右派分子斗争到底。
