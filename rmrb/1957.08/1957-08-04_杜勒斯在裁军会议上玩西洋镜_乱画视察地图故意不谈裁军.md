London Dispatch from Our Newspaper, August 3rd: Dulles attended yesterday's disarmament subcommittee meeting and, on behalf of the Western four powers, put forward a sensational so-called "new" proposal to "prevent the possibility of sudden attacks." This is a most obvious political fraud. Dulles's tricks of mystification and pretentiousness in London have reached their climax.

However, just as a soap bubble is bound to burst, Dulles's painstakingly designed fraud has been completely exposed after yesterday's disarmament subcommittee meeting.

The main points of the proposal put forward by Dulles are as follows:

1.  The entire mainland of the United States, the entire state of Alaska, the entire mainland of Canada, and the entire territory of the Soviet Union are open as aerial inspection zones. If the Soviet Union rejects this "broad proposal," the scope of the aerial inspection zone can be reduced to the entire territories of the Soviet Union, Canada, the United States, Denmark, Norway, and other countries located north of the Arctic Circle... 2. If the Soviet Union accepts the above agreement, the four countries suggest that the aerial inspection zone in Europe should be: south to 40 degrees north latitude, west to 10 degrees west longitude, and east to 60 degrees east longitude. If the Soviet Union rejects this "broad proposal," then a more limited European inspection area can be discussed, but it must include a "sufficient" part of Soviet territory and a part of the territory of Eastern European countries. 3. The scope of activities of ground inspection posts should not be smaller than the aerial inspection zone.

At the disarmament subcommittee meeting, Dulles "talked about other things while looking around." He kicked aside the issue of stopping testing and banning the use of nuclear weapons and remained silent on the issue of reducing armed forces and conventional armaments. He pretended to forget the task given to the disarmament subcommittee by the United Nations General Assembly, which is to draft a convention to achieve a substantial reduction of all armed forces and conventional armaments, as well as a complete ban on the use and cessation of production of nuclear weapons and all weapons of mass slaughter.

Dulles's plan shows that the United States and its allies do not demand the reduction of armaments, let alone want to stop testing and producing nuclear weapons; what they demand is only "preventing sudden attacks." However, according to the most basic common sense, one can also draw the following logic: maintaining a large number of armed forces, especially continuing to produce and store a large number of nuclear weapons, precisely increases the possibility of aggressors carrying out sudden attacks. It can be seen from this that Dulles's "new" proposal is not only devoid of any practical significance but is also an attempt to put a legal cloak on the United States' continued nuclear arms race.

Exposing the trickery, Dulles's real purpose in coming to London, in addition to "discussing" the Oman issue with the British government, is to obstruct disarmament negotiations while trying to escape the condemnation of the people of the world.

    杜勒斯在裁军会议上玩西洋镜
    乱画视察地图故意不谈裁军
    本报伦敦3日电　杜勒斯出席了昨天的裁军小组会议，并代表西方四国，提出了一个耸人听闻的所谓“防止突然袭击可能性”的“新”建议。这是最明显不过的政治骗局。杜勒斯在伦敦故弄玄虚和装腔作势的伎俩，至此已达顶点。
    但是，正如肥皂泡之非破不可一样，杜勒斯苦心设计的骗局，在昨天的裁军小组会议后，已被全部拆穿。
    杜勒斯提出的建议要点如下：
    一、美国本土全部、阿拉斯加全部、加拿大本土全部，以及苏联领土全部，开放为空中视察区。如果苏联拒绝这一“广泛建议”，则可把空中视察区的范围缩小为苏联、加拿大、美国、丹麦、挪威等国家位于北极圈以北的全部领土……。二、如果苏联接受了上述协议，四国建议，在欧洲的空中视察区是：南至北纬四十度，西至西经十度，东至东经六十度。如果苏联拒绝了这个“广泛建议”，那么可以讨论一个更有限的欧洲视察地区，但必须包括“足够的”苏联部分领土和东欧国家的部分领土。三、地面视察哨的活动范围，不应小于空中视察区。
    杜勒斯在裁军小组会议上“王顾左右而言他”，他一脚踢开了停止试验和禁止使用核武器问题，也闭口不谈裁减武装部队和常规军备问题。他假装忘记了联合国大会给予裁军小组的任务，这就是：拟订一个公约，以实现大量裁减一切武装部队和常规军备，以及彻底禁止使用和停止生产核武器和一切大规模屠杀的武器。
    杜勒斯方案表明：美国和它的盟国不要求裁减军备，更不想停止试验和生产核武器；他们所要求的只是“防止突然袭击”。但是，根据最起码的常识，人们也可以得出这样一个逻辑：保持大量的武装力量，特别是继续生产和大量储存核武器，恰恰是增加了侵略者实行突然袭击的可能性。由此可见，杜勒斯的“新”建议不仅毫无现实意义，而且是企图为美国继续进行核武器竞赛披上合法的外衣。
    拆穿西洋镜，杜勒斯来伦敦的真正目的，除了和英国政府“讨论”阿曼问题以外，就是要阻挠裁军谈判，同时又想逃避全世界人民的谴责。
