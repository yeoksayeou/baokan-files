　　Poland Exceeds Semiannual Production Plan
　　Industrial and Agricultural Production Both Increase Compared to the Same Period Last Year
    This newspaper’s dispatch from Warsaw on the 21st—The Polish State Central Bureau of Statistics published a lengthy communiqué announcing that Poland's total industrial production plan for the first half of this year has been exceeded. The communiqué stated that industrial production in the first half of the year completed 52% of the annual production plan, an increase of 8.6% over the same period last year.
    "People's Tribune" published an editorial on this, pointing out that this is a powerful rebuttal to Western propaganda organs’ claims that "Poland's industrial production is on the verge of collapse" and "industrial production is declining sharply" (New York Times).
    The communiqué shows that the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the Ministry of Light Industry, the Ministry of Chemical Industry, and the Ministry of Forestry and Timber Industry have all completed or exceeded their semiannual production plans. The total production value of the Ministry of Heavy Industry in the first half of the year increased by 11.6% compared to the same period last year. The communiqué indicated that the production of some products decreased, such as coal production, which was only equivalent to 98.2% of the same period last year, mainly due to the reduction of Sunday workdays in coal mines.
    Factories under the Ministry of Light Industry also completed their production plans and supplied nearly one billion zlotys worth of goods to the market above the plan. The communiqué pointed out that in terms of commodity turnover in the state-owned trade system, the first half of this year increased by 26% compared to the same period last year. The communiqué also pointed out that by the end of June this year, the number of private shops reached 25,000, of which 10,000 were newly established in the first half of this year.
    Regarding the agricultural situation, the communiqué stated that in the first half of this year, agricultural groups and other autonomous forms of farmers have developed. By the end of June, there were 9,500 farmer groups with 290,000 members.
    Regarding people's lives and employment, the communiqué pointed out that the number of people employed in the state-owned economy in the first half of this year was 6.85 million, an increase of 3% compared to the same period last year. The wage fund in state-owned enterprises in the first half of this year increased by 25% compared to the same period last year, while in industrial enterprises it increased by 30%. In the first half of this year, the wages of about one million workers were adjusted, and as a result of the adjustment, the state will spend about four billion zlotys more in a year.
    While affirming the above major achievements, "People's Tribune" pointed out that the market situation is still quite tense. In foreign trade, imports are greater than exports, creating an imbalance. Absenteeism in industrial enterprises is relatively serious.

　　波兰超额完成上半年生产计划
　  工农业生产都比去年同期有所增长
    本报华沙21日电　波兰国家中央统计局发表长篇公报，宣布波兰今年上半年的工业总生产计划已经超额完成。公报说，工业生产在今年上半年内完成了全年生产计划的52％，比去年同时期增长8.6％。
    “人民论坛报”为此发表社论，指出这是对西方宣传机关所谓“波兰工业生产趋于穷途末路”、“工业生产直线下降”（纽约时报）的有力驳斥。
    公报表明，重工业部、轻工业部、化学工业部、林业和木材工业部都完成或超额完成了半年生产计划。重工业部半年的生产总值比去年同期增长11.6％。公报表明有些产品减产了，如煤产量仅相当于去年同期的98.2％，这主要是由于煤矿减少了星期日工作日的原故。
    轻工业部所属工厂也完成了生产计划并且超计划向市场供应了将近十亿兹罗提的商品。公报指出，在国营贸易系统的商品流转方面今年上半年比去年同期增加26％。公报同时指出，到今年6月为止，私营商店数目达到两万五千家，其中有一万家是在今年上半年增设的。
    关于农业方面的情况，公报说，今年上半年，农业小组和农民的其他自治形式都有所发展，到6月底为止，农民小组达九千五百个，成员二十九万。
    在人民生活和就业方面，公报指出：今年上半年在国营经济中就业的人数为六百八十五万，比去年同期增加3％。今年上半年在国营企业中的工资基金比去年同期增加25％，而在工业企业中则增加30％。今年上半年内约有一百万工作人员调整了工资，调整结果，在一年内国家将多支出约四十亿兹罗提。
      “人民论坛报”在肯定上述重大成就时指出，市场情况还相当紧张。在对外贸易方面进口多而出口少，形成不平衡局面。在工业企业中缺勤现象较为严重。
