Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 29th. Over 3,000 Shanghai university students who lived, ate, and labored alongside suburban farmers for three to six days have returned to school. Having personally experienced rural life, they all believe that the countryside has a bright future, and that the right-wing elements' cries of the countryside being "pitch black" are utter nonsense.

These university students began going to the countryside on August 7th. After the anti-rightist struggle, the university students, strongly demanding to transform themselves, labored well in the countryside. When they became sore, tired, and exhausted, they returned home and carried water, swept the floor, fed pigs, and held children for the farmers, doing whatever work was available. Many farmers said: Only today's schools cultivate our own children.

In addition to selflessly participating in various kinds of labor, many university students also took advantage of every opportunity to visit farmers. After returning to school, they all used the vivid facts they saw and heard with their own eyes and ears to denounce the various shameless rumors and slanders of the right-wing elements against the countryside.

　  到农村去切实改造自己
　　三千多大学生和农民同劳动
    新华社上海29日电　和郊区农民同住同吃同劳动了三天到六天的上海三千多名大学生，已经陆续返校。由于他们亲自体验了农村生活，都认为农村前途似锦，右派分子叫嚷的农村“一团漆黑”全是胡说八道。
    这些大学生是在8月7日开始陆续到农村去的。经过反右派斗争后强烈要求改造自己的大学生们，在农村劳动的很好。他们搞得腰酸背疼精疲力竭的时候，回到家里还给农民挑水、扫地，喂猪，抱小孩，见什么活干什么活。许多农民都说：只有现在的学校才培养出了我们自己的子女。
    许多大学生除了忘我地参加各种劳动外，还利用一切机会访问农民。他们回校后都以自己亲眼所见，亲耳所闻的活生生的事实，痛斥右派分子对农村的各种无耻造谣和污蔑。
