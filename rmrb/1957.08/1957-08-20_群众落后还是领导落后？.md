Are the Masses Backward or is Leadership Backward?
		Wu Lü

The Dali Textile and Dyeing Factory in Yunnan Province failed to meet its production plan and quality targets for the first half of the year. It is worth noting that Du Guilian, a female weaver in this factory, created a set of operating methods with high output and good quality as early as the second half of last year. Why not promote Du Guilian's advanced experience to avoid falling into the predicament of failing to complete the plan and meet the targets? The factory director, Zhao Zhongkun, replied, "Some workers have conservative ideas and think that Du Guilian's operating methods have nothing to learn from." The implication is: the masses are backward, what can I do? This "theory of backward masses" is not only used by Director Zhao to cover up his failure to promote advanced experience, but also often used by some other people as a shield when they are criticized in other work.

Are the masses all backward? Of course not. Zhao Zhongkun also admits this. He only said that "some workers have conservative ideas," which shows that there are some workers who do not have conservative ideas. This is also the case in reality. Some workers in the Dali Textile and Dyeing Factory have criticized the leadership for not promoting Du Guilian's operating methods on the one hand, and suffering from failing to complete the plan on the other, as "holding a golden bowl and begging for food." So, why is it that some workers demand to learn advanced experience, and even make such sharp criticisms of the leadership, but still cannot push the factory director to actively organize the promotion of advanced experience, while the conservative ideas of some other workers suddenly bind the factory director's "enthusiasm" for promoting advanced experience? Here, is it the masses who have conservative ideas, or is it the factory director who has conservative ideas?

Let's make an assumption. Suppose "some workers with conservative ideas" have indeed become a strong obstacle to the promotion of advanced experience, and suppose the masses are indeed "very backward," then people can't help but ask: what exactly has the factory director done to overcome this obstacle? There is a difference between advanced and backward thinking among the masses, and "some workers have conservative ideas" is not a big deal. If every worker is advanced and keen to learn advanced experience, then why is there a need for leaders to promote it? "Some workers have conservative ideas" is precisely the time for factory directors and other leading cadres to do their duty, to do ideological work and organizational work. Why do they lie down in front of some workers with "conservative ideas" instead? Here, who is lagging behind, the masses or the factory director?

The "theory of backward masses" is actually the "theory of abandoning leadership" and is a reflection of the backwardness of the leaders.

### 群众落后还是领导落后？

    群众落后还是领导落后？
    吴滤
    云南省大理织染厂上半年的产量计划和质量指标都没有完成。值得注意的是，这个厂里的织布女工杜桂莲远在去年下半年就创造了一套产量高、质量好的操作方法。为什么不推广杜桂莲的先进经验，来避免陷入完不成计划达不到指标的困境呢？厂长赵钟琨的答复是：“一些工人有保守思想，认为杜桂莲的操作法没有可学习的东西。”言下之意是：群众落后，我有什么办法呢？这种“群众落后论”，不仅被赵厂长拿来掩饰自己推广先进经验不力，而且，其他一些人在别的工作上受到批评时，也常常被搬出来作挡箭牌。
    群众是不是都落后呢？当然不是。这一点，赵钟琨也承认。他只说“一些工人有保守思想”，可见还有些工人是没有保守思想的。事实也是如此。大理织染厂就有些工人批评过领导上一方面不推广杜桂莲操作法，一方面又苦于完不成计划是“端着金碗当叫花”。那么，为什么一些工人要求学习先进经验，甚至对领导上提出了这样尖锐的批评，还不能推动厂长积极组织推广先进经验，而另一些工人的保守思想，却一下子就把厂长推广先进经验的“积极性”束缚住了呢？这里，究竟是群众有保守思想，还是厂长有保守思想？
    不妨来一个假设，假设“一些工人有保守思想”确实已成为推广先进经验的强大的阻力，假设群众确实“十分落后”，那么，人们不禁要问：厂长究竟做过些什么工作来克服这种阻力呢？群众的思想有先进和落后之别，“一些工人有保守思想”，并不是什么了不起的事情。若是个个工人都是先进的，都热衷于学习先进经验，那又何需领导上来推广呢？“一些工人有保守思想”，正是厂长等领导干部去克尽职守，去做思想工作和组织工作的时候，为什么反而在一些有“保守思想”的工人面前躺倒了呢？这里，落后了的究竟是群众，还是厂长？
    “群众落后论”，实际上就是“放弃领导论”，是领导者落后了的反映。
