Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, August 19th: Currently, Anshan Iron and Steel's technical and economic indicators in ironmaking have surpassed those of capitalist countries like Britain and the United States and are approaching the advanced levels of the Soviet Union.

This year, Anshan Iron and Steel workers have further promoted advanced experiences and new technologies such as high-temperature and humid-air operation, low-manganese steel production, and high-basicity self-fluxing sintered ore. The effective volume of blast furnace occupied per ton of pig iron produced has decreased from an average of 0.737 cubic meters last year to 0.712 cubic meters in the first half of this year. There has been a further reduction in the past two months, with 0.698 cubic meters in June and 0.685 cubic meters in July. This achievement has greatly exceeded the levels of capitalist countries such as Britain and the United States. The utilization coefficient of American blast furnaces is generally above 0.8. Taking the American Wheildon Steel Company as an example, the company's blast furnace utilization coefficient last year was 0.870, which is only equivalent to the level of Anshan Iron and Steel Plant in 1952. The technical and economic indicator of the blast furnace utilization coefficient of Anshan has also exceeded the level of general blast furnaces in the Soviet Union and is approaching the level of advanced blast furnaces in the Soviet Union.

In the first half of this year, the coke consumption per ton of pig iron produced by Anshan Iron and Steel's blast furnaces was 725 kilograms, 705 kilograms in June, and further reduced to 689 kilograms in July. This indicator is also more advanced than those of capitalist countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and West Germany. Taking the American Wheildon Steel Company as an example again, in 1956 they needed 835 kilograms of coke to produce one ton of pig iron.

    鞍钢炼铁技术超过英美水平
    新华社鞍山19日电　目前鞍钢炼铁方面的技术经济指标已经超过英、美等资本主义国家水平而接近苏联的先进水平了。
    今年，鞍钢炼铁工人们进一步推广了高温湿风操作法、低锰制钢铁、高碱度自熔性烧结矿等先进经验和新技术，每炼一吨生铁所占用的高炉有效容积，从去年平均零点七三七立方公尺，降低到今年上半年的零点七一二立方公尺。最近两个月又有进一步降低，6月份是零点六九八立方公尺，7月份是零点六八五立方公尺。这一成就已经大大超过了英、美等资本主义国家的水平。美国高炉利用系数一般都在零点八以上。以美国威尔登钢铁公司为例，这个公司去年的高炉利用系数是零点八七零，仅仅相当于鞍钢炼铁厂1952年的水平。鞍钢高炉利用系数这一技术经济指标，并且已经超过苏联一般高炉的水平，接近于苏联先进高炉的水平。
    今年上半年鞍钢高炉每炼一吨生铁所消耗的焦炭是七百二十五公斤，6月份是七百零五公斤，7月份又降低到六百八十九公斤。这一指标也比英、美、法、西德等资本主义国家先进。也以美国威尔登钢铁公司为例，1956年他们要用八百三十五公斤焦炭才能炼出一吨生铁。
