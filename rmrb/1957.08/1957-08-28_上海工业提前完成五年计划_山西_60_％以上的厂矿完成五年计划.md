Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 27th - Shanghai Deputy Mayor Song Jiwen said at the second session of the Second Shanghai Municipal People's Congress, which officially opened on the 26th, that due to the tremendous development of Shanghai's national economy in 1956, Shanghai's total industrial output value had reached the 1957 level stipulated in the first Five-Year Plan one year and three months ahead of schedule.
	In his "Report on the Implementation of Shanghai's National Economic Plan for 1956 and the National Economic Plan for 1957" to all delegates, Song Jiwen said that Shanghai's socialist construction in 1956 was unprecedented in terms of both speed and scale. In 1956, Shanghai's total industrial output value reached 11.963 billion yuan, exceeding the original plan by 17.2%, an increase of 3.2 billion yuan compared with 1955. This increase in output value is equal to the total industrial output value of the entire city of Shanghai in 1949. In other words, the growth rate of industrial production in 1956 was equal to the development rate of Shanghai from 1843, when modern industry began to be established, to 1948, a period of 105 years.
	Song Jiwen said that 1956 was also a year of great victory for Shanghai's socialist transformation. All 25,853 private industrial enterprises and 58,478 private commercial enterprises in the city have realized joint state-private ownership, and a large number of handicraftsmen and small vendors have also basically embarked on the road of collectivization. This fundamental change in production relations has increased the total output value of joint ventures by 42.9% compared with the private period in 1955, and labor productivity has increased by 27.3%.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 27th - So far, 175 state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines in Shanxi Province have completed the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. These factories and mines account for 63.6% of the units in the province that have a five-year plan.
	The total industrial output value of Shanxi Province has reached the level of the last year of the first Five-Year Plan, exceeding the target by 15.1% six months ahead of schedule. Twenty-six major products, including electricity, pig iron, steel, coke, drilling machines, cotton yarn, and cotton cloth, which are included in the Five-Year Plan, have also reached the level of the last year of the Five-Year Plan. These products account for more than 70% of all major products in the Five-Year Plan.
	Among the units that have completed the first Five-Year Plan targets, nearly 20 factories and mines are large state-owned enterprises.
	In the first half of this year, industrial enterprises in Shanxi Province exceeded their production plans month by month. At present, the province's workers have launched a new upsurge of production in the struggle against the bourgeois rightists. According to statistics from 30 major factories and mines, the total output value in July was 104% of the plan, and several major products also exceeded the plan. Since early August, the six production enterprises of the Taiyuan Coal Mining Administration have also overfulfilled their tasks. In particular, some factories and mines that did not complete their plans well in the past, such as the Datong Coal Mine and the Taiyuan Cement Plant, have also seen a significant improvement in production.

　　上海工业提前完成五年计划
    山西60％以上的厂矿完成五年计划
    据新华社上海27日电　上海市副市长宋季文在26日正式开幕的上海市第二届人民代表大会第二次会议上说，由于1956年上海市国民经济的巨大发展，上海的工业生产总值已经提前一年零三个月达到了第一个五年计划规定的1957年水平。
    宋季文在向全体代表所作的“关于上海市1956年度国民经济计划执行情况和1957年度国民经济计划的报告”中说，1956年上海的社会主义建设，不论发展的速度和规模在历史上都是空前的。1956年上海工业生产总值达到一百一十九亿六千三百万元，超过原计划17.2％，比1955年增长三十二亿元。这个增加的产值，等于1949年全上海的工业生产总值。也就是说，1956年工业生产增长的速度，同解放前1843年上海开始建立现代工业到1948年间一百零五年的发展速度相等。
    宋季文说，1956年也是上海社会主义改造取得伟大胜利的一年。全市二万五千八百五十三户私营工业和五万八千四百七十八户私营商业已经全部实现公私合营，为数众多的手工业者和小商贩也基本上走上了合作化的道路。这种生产关系的根本改变，使合营工业的生产总值比1955年私营时期增长了42.9％；劳动生产率增长了27.3％。
    据新华社太原27日电　到目前为止，山西省已经有一百七十五个国营、地方国营厂矿提前完成了第一个五年计划。这些厂矿占全省编有五年计划的单位的63.6％。
    山西省工业企业总产值已经提前半年超额15.1％达到了第一个五年计划最后一年的水平。列入五年计划的电力、生铁、钢、焦炭、钻探机、棉纱、棉布等二十六种主要产品，也达到了五年计划最后一年的水平。这些产品占五年计划中全部主要产品的70％以上。
    完成第一个五年计划指标的单位中，有近二十个厂矿是大型的国营企业。
    今年上半年山西省工业企业逐月超额完成了生产计划。目前，全省职工在反资产阶级右派斗争中，又掀起了新的生产高潮。据三十个主要厂矿统计，7月份总产值完成了104％，几种主要产品也超额完成了计划。8月上旬以来，太原煤矿管理局六个生产企业又超额完成了任务。特别是一些过去完成计划不好的厂矿，如大同煤矿、太原水泥厂，生产也大有起色。
