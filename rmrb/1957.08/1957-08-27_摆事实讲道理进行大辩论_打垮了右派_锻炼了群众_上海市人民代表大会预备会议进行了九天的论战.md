　　Conducting Great Debates by Presenting Facts and Reasoning
　　Defeating the Rightists and Training the Masses
　　The Preparatory Meeting of the Shanghai Municipal People's Congress Conducted Nine Days of Debate
    This dispatch from Shanghai, August 26th. This is a report from our reporters Ji Yin and Xi Ping: The people of Shanghai recently launched a face-to-face, nationwide great debate with the right-wing elements. This great debate took place at the preparatory meeting of the Second Session of the Second Shanghai Municipal People's Congress. The meeting lasted for nine days, from the 15th to the 24th. The result of the great debate was a complete defeat for the right-wing elements and a great victory for the people.
    During this great debate, a comprehensive exposure and criticism was made of more than twenty right-wing elements among the People's Representatives and those attending the meeting, including fifteen right-wing elements who had already been exposed and criticized in society before the meeting: Peng Wenyin, Chen Renbing, Sun Dayu, Shen Zhiyuan, Wang ZaoShi, Lu Yi, Xia Gaoyang, Zhang Mengwen, Xu Jie, Luo Jiaheng, Li Kangnian, Wang Zijian, Han Ming, Lu Mang, Xu Buwu, etc. There were some newly exposed right-wing elements at the meeting, including: Dong Renjian, professor at Shanghai Foreign Language Institute, Jin Youyun, principal of Shanghai Hui Nationality Middle School, Zhu Kongjia, Gu Shouxi, Dong Guimin, members of the right-wing group within the Catholic Church, Wu Chengxi, deputy director of the Preparatory Office of the Shanghai Institute of Economics of the Academy of Sciences, and a right-wing element within the Party.
    The debate was conducted in the form of group meetings. The biggest feature of this great debate was the consistent implementation of the spirit of presenting facts and reasoning, with both sides conducting debates. The facts of the past nine days have proved that this is the most thorough method of anti-rightist struggle and a truly pragmatic method. During the debate, right-wing elements were allowed to fully elaborate their arguments and conduct rebuttals. They could also find witnesses who were favorable to them to testify. Many right-wing elements, such as Peng Wenyin and Sun Dayu, prepared a large amount of material to counterattack, but they could not refute the truth and the facts. The result of the right-wing elements' efforts to quibble and counterattack only further exposed their ugliness. For example, Peng Wenyin slandered Shanghai as the dirtiest city in the world. Public health expert Wu Dicang and others used statistics and facts to prove Peng Wenyin's shameless lies. Luo Jiaheng attacked judicial cadres from worker-peasant backgrounds for not understanding the law. Representative Miao Lichen presented an investigation report at the meeting, proving that the quality of cases handled by worker-peasant judicial cadres was very high. Wang Hengshou spread rumors that the seamless steel pipes produced by Anshan Iron and Steel had seams, in order to slander the achievements of China's industrial construction. Li Bide, the chief engineer of the Shanghai Boiler Factory, immediately used the facts of his own factory to explain that the six or seven thousand tons of seamless steel pipes used by the factory had undergone technical tests and were not only seamless but also free of sand holes, and Wang Hengshou's rumors were exposed on the spot.
    During the debate, the representatives also conducted a comprehensive and systematic analysis and criticism of the various bourgeois viewpoints of the right-wing elements, involving some fundamental issues of the Party and the state. Some groups systematically refuted the twelve questions about the socialist economic system raised by the right-wing element Peng Wenyin. Some groups refuted the fallacies of Sun Dayu, Zhang Mengwen, and others on fundamental issues such as ideological remolding, counter-revolution suppression, teaching reform, and learning from the Soviet Union. Many debates were exceptionally brilliant, especially the several major debates with Peng Wenyin, Sun Dayu, Wang Zaoshi, and Zhang Mengwen. They repeatedly counterattacked, but the representatives listed facts and refuted them completely.
    Workers, peasants, intellectuals, and representatives from other strata spoke about their different experiences in the old and new societies at the debate, which was a very important part of the debate. It most powerfully attacked the fallacies of the right-wing elements and educated the people. The tearful recollections of retired old worker Shi Xiaomei, Peking opera actress Li Yuru, middle school student Wang Lurong, and many other representatives greatly moved everyone. Before liberation, People's Representative Wang Lurong, a student at Xuhui Middle School, was a street urchin who suffered inhuman living conditions. After liberation, he was taken in by the People's Government and given an education, and today he lives a happy life. When he indignantly questioned the right-wing elements with tears in his eyes, many representatives in the audience were moved to tears.
    The right-wing elements could not withstand the test of facts and truth. After a few days of debate, their resistance finally collapsed from a step-by-step retreat to a complete collapse. A rapid division occurred among the right-wing elements, and some people began to bow their heads and confess their guilt in the face of truth, expressing their willingness to completely change their reactionary stance, wash their hearts and minds, and start anew in the future. Mutual exposure also began among the right-wing elements. When Sun Dayu was still quibbling about his conspiracy with the right-wing group to attack the Party, Lu Yi and Zhang Mengwen both came to the meeting to provide facts to prove it. When Peng Wenyin flatly denied that the Shanghai Democratic League right-wing group had anti-communist activities, Chen Renbing listed facts to prove the group's anti-communist activities. Lu Yi also revealed some materials about Zhang Mengwen's anti-communist activities, and Zhang Mengwen also offered opinions on Lu Yi's confession. The division and mutual exposure of the right-wing elements made the struggle situation more favorable, and made the faces of some stubborn right-wing elements more exposed and more isolated and helpless. The facts in this great debate also show that some people in the bourgeois right-wing are diehards who are determined to be reactionary to the end, such as Peng Wenyin and Dong Renjian. Although their crimes were exposed in the debate, they still refused to confess, but instead continued to unscrupulously promote reactionary bourgeois theories and attack the Communist Party and socialist cause by using the rostrum of the debate. Some also resorted to rogue methods such as feigning illness and refusing to attend the meeting. Their behavior aroused even greater resentment among the people and made them see through the reactionary nature of these right-wing elements.
    The method of great debate by presenting facts and reasoning is also the most effective method for training the masses, educating and uniting the middle elements, and eliminating the influence of the right-wing. In this great debate, in order to refute the right-wing, the representatives searched for powerful materials, and seriously analyzed and studied the right-wing's remarks, so as to make themselves invincible. Many people reflected: "Participating in this great debate is really like taking the most profound lesson." Many middle masses who were originally vague about the struggle also became aware of it. Many people who had been silent in the past couldn't help but stand up and speak out against the right-wing at this meeting. Xu Senyu, an archaeologist in his seventies, the old painter Feng Zikai, and the calligrapher Shen Yinmo all made impassioned speeches at the meeting. People's Representative Hu Zhongfan reviewed his past attitude of "watching the fire from the other side of the river" towards the anti-rightist struggle. At this meeting, he realized that "this is a struggle for life and death."
    At this debate, some representatives who had made serious mistakes in the past also made self-criticisms at the meeting and launched mutual criticisms. However, the criticism of these people was treated differently from the struggle against the right-wing elements.
    On the basis of this great debate, the Second Session of the Second Shanghai Municipal People's Congress has officially opened today. At this meeting, the reactionary words and deeds of the right-wing elements will be exposed and criticized more deeply and systematically, and the struggle will be carried out victoriously to the end.

　　摆事实讲道理进行大辩论
　　打垮了右派  锻炼了群众
　　上海市人民代表大会预备会议进行了九天的论战
    本报上海26日电　本报记者季音、习平报道：上海人民最近与右派分子展开了一次面对面的全民性的大辩论。这次大辩论是在上海市二届二次人民代表大会预备会议上进行的。会议从15日开到24日，共举行了九天。大辩论的结果是右派分子彻底败阵，人民大获全胜。
    这次大辩论中，共对人民代表和列席人员中的二十多个右派分子作了全面的揭露和批判，其中有十五个右派分子是在会前已经在社会上受到揭露和批判的，他们是：彭文应、陈仁炳、孙大雨、沈志远、王造时、陆诒、夏高阳、张孟闻、许杰、罗家衡、李康年、王子建、韩鸣、鲁莽、许卜五等。有一些是在会上新揭发出来的右派分子，他们是：上海外国语学院教授董任坚、上海市回民中学校长金幼云、天主教内右派集团分子朱孔嘉、顾守熙、董贵民，科学院上海经济研究所筹备处副主任、党内右派分子吴承禧等。
    辩论是采取分组召开会议的形式进行的。这次大辩论的最大特色，是始终贯彻了摆事实，讲道理的精神，双方进行辩论。九天来的事实证明，这是反右派斗争最彻底的方法，是真正实事求是的方法。辩论中允许右派分子充分阐明自己的论点，进行答辩。还可以找有利于他们的证人前来作证。不少右派分子如彭文应、孙大雨等人，都准备了大量材料，进行反扑，但真理和事实是他们所驳不倒的。右派分子竭力狡辩、反扑的结果，反而更加暴露了他们的丑恶。例如彭文应污蔑说上海是国际上最脏的城市。公共卫生专家吴涤苍等就用统计数字和事实，证明了彭文应的无耻造谣。罗家衡攻击工农出身的司法干部不懂法律。苗力沉代表就在会上提出调查报告，证明工农司法干部办案质量很高。王恒守造谣说，鞍钢生产的无缝钢管有缝，用来污蔑我国工业建设的成就。上海锅炉厂总工程师李彼得即用本厂的事实说明该厂所用的六、七千吨无缝钢管经过技术试验，不但无缝，也无砂眼，王恒守的谣言当场拆穿。
    在辩论中，代表们还针对右派分子的各种资产阶级观点，牵涉到党和国家的一些根本问题，进行了全面、系统的分析和批判。有的组系统地批驳了右派分子彭文应提出的关于社会主义经济制度的十二个问题。有的组批驳了孙大雨、张孟闻等关于思想改造、肃反、教学改革、学习苏联等这些根本问题上的谬论。许多场的辩论会进行得异常精采，特别是对彭文应、孙大雨、王造时、张孟闻的几次大论战，他们曾一再进行反扑，但代表们列举事实，把他们驳得体无完肤。
    工人、农民、知识分子以及其他各阶层代表，在辩论会上诉说自己在新旧社会的不同遭遇，这是辩论会中极重要的组成部分，它最有力地抨击了右派分子的谬论，教育了人们。退休老工人施小妹、京剧演员李玉茹、中学生王禄荣等许多代表的血泪回忆，都使大家受到很大感动。人民代表、徐汇中学学生王禄荣解放前是街头的一个流浪儿，受尽了非人的生活，解放后才由人民政府收容，并给他教育，今天过着幸福的生活。当他激愤地含泪责问右派分子的时候，会场上不少代表都感动得落泪。
    右派分子是经不起事实与真理的考验的，辩论会进行了几天之后，他们的抵抗终于由步步败退而至全线崩溃，右派分子中间就迅速发生了分化，有一部分人开始在真理面前低头服罪，作了交代，表示愿意在今后彻底改变反动立场，洗心革面，重新作人。右派分子之间也开始了相互之间的揭发。当孙大雨还在狡赖他和右派集团共谋向党进攻的事实时，陆诒、张孟闻都到会提供事实加以证明。当彭文应矢口否认上海民盟右派集团有反共活动时，陈仁炳列举事实，证明这个集团的反共活动。陆诒还揭发了张孟闻反共活动的一些材料，张孟闻也对陆诒的交代提出意见。右派分子的分化和相互揭发，使斗争形势更为有利，使一部分顽抗的右派分子的面目更加暴露，更加孤立无援。这次大辩论中的事实也说明，资产阶级右派中有一部分人是死硬派，他们是坚决反动到底的，如彭文应、董任坚，在辩论中虽已罪行大白，但仍拒不作交代，反而利用辩论会的讲坛继续肆无忌惮地宣扬反动的资产阶级论调，攻击共产党和社会主义事业。有的还施展了装病拒不到会等无赖手段。他们的这种行为，更加激起了人们的愤懑，看穿了这些右派的反动本质。
    摆事实，讲道理的这种大辩论的方法，也是锻炼群众，教育、团结中间分子，肃清右派影响的最有效方法。这次大辩论中，代表们为了驳倒右派，他们就四出搜集有力的材料，认真地分析、研究右派的言论，以便使自己立于不败之地。许多人反映：“参加这次大辩论，真是上了最深刻的一课。”许多本来对斗争认识模糊的中间群众也觉悟了过来，不少过去一直保持沉默的人，这次在会上都情不自禁地起来发言痛斥右派。年过七旬的考古家徐森玉、老画家丰子恺、书法家沈尹默等老先生，都在会上慷慨陈词。人民代表胡仲藩检讨自己过去对反右派斗争一直抱“隔岸观火”的态度，这次会上他才认识到“这是一次生死存亡的斗争”。
    在这次辩论会上，一些过去有严重错误言行的代表，也在会上作了自我批判，并且展开了相互的批判。但是对这些人的批评，是与对右派分子的斗争区别开来对待的。
    就在这次大辩论的基础上，上海市第二届第二次人民代表大会今天已正式开幕，这次会上将要更深入、系统地对右派分子的反动言行进行揭发批判，把斗争胜利地进行到底。
