    Not only eating enough, but also starting to eat well
　　Sichuan and Gansu farmers' grain retention increases year by year

    In 1956, Sichuan Province's total grain output reached 44.5 billion jin, an increase of 48.9% compared to 1949, and 23.8% higher than the historical peak year of 1938 (35.95 billion jin of unprocessed grain), completing and exceeding the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. This year, the total grain output is expected to reach 47.632 billion jin, exceeding the first Five-Year Plan target by 14%.

    Due to the development of agricultural production, especially the significant increase in grain production, in recent years, farmers in Sichuan Province have not only sold a large amount of surplus grain to support national industrial construction and aid the people in cities and disaster areas, but also gradually improved their own grain consumption levels. Before liberation, due to the continuous decline in agricultural production, coupled with the cruel exploitation by landlords and rich peasants, many farmers lived a life of half chaff and vegetables and half grain. Now, they are not only able to eat enough but are also gradually eating well. According to a survey of six representative farmers in the Gonghe Cooperative of Dinghai Township, Fushun County, a major double-cropping rice growing area, in 1948, a normal year before liberation, the average per capita grain consumption was 277 jin, of which poor peasants consumed only 165 jin per capita per year; before the establishment of agricultural cooperatives after liberation, the average per capita grain consumption was 391 jin, and in 1956 after joining the cooperatives, the average per capita grain consumption reached 627 jin. According to relevant information, the average per capita grain retention for farmers throughout the province in 1953 was 502 jin, and this has increased year by year in recent years, reaching an average of 544 jin per capita last year. This year, the per capita grain retention level can be slightly increased compared to last year.

    In Gansu Province, historically known for its poverty, farmers' grain has increased year by year since liberation. According to a survey of income and expenditure of 780 farm households in different types of areas by the Gansu Provincial Bureau of Statistics: the average per capita grain consumption in 1954 was 447.6 jin (including 167.2 jin of refined grains), and in 1956 it was 477.2 jin (including 181.8 jin of refined grains), which is higher than the grain consumption standards of people in cities and industrial and mining areas. This shows that the grain left by farmers after state procurement is not only enough to eat, but also has a surplus.

    Most of the farmers in Gansu Province used to live a life of half chaff and vegetables and half grain. Since liberation, the province's population has rapidly increased from 10.07 million to 14.16 million. However, grain production has been remarkably successful, and the total grain output of the province in 1956 more than doubled compared to the early days of liberation. Therefore, the living conditions of farmers have improved year by year, and the grain left by farmers after state procurement has increased year by year. From the average per capita grain retention of 423 jin for farmers after procurement in 1953 (including rations, feed grain, and seed grain, same below), the subsequent annual retentions were 495 jin, 533 jin, and 737 jin. If the grain resold to the rural areas by the state in various years is included, the average per agricultural population was 454 jin in 1953, 529 jin in 1954, 580 jin in 1955, and 786 jin in 1956.

### 不但吃饱了　而且开始吃好了　四川甘肃农民留粮逐年增加

　　比比·算算·想想·看看
    不但吃饱了　而且开始吃好了
　　四川甘肃农民留粮逐年增加
    四川省1956年粮食总产量达到四百四十五亿斤，比1949年增加48．9％，比历史上最高年产量的1938年（三百五十九点五亿斤原粮）还高23.8％，提前并超额完成了第一个五年计划。今年粮食总产量预计可达到四百七十六点三二亿斤，超过第一个五年计划指标的14％。
    由于农业生产的发展，特别是粮食显著增产，几年来，四川省农民不仅卖出大量余粮，支援国家工业建设，支援城市和灾区人民，并且逐步地提高了自己的吃粮水平。解放前，由于农业生产逐年下降，加上地主、富农的残酷剥削，不少农民都过着半年糠菜半年粮的生活。现在不但能吃饱而且逐步吃好了。根据双季稻主要种植区的富顺县丁海乡共和社，六户有代表性的农民的调查，解放前正常年景的1948年，每人平均吃粮二百七十七斤，其中贫农每人全年仅吃粮一百六十五斤；解放后建立农业社前平均每人食粮三百九十一斤，入社后的1956年，平均每人食粮达六百二十七斤。据有关方面的材料，全省农民在1953年时每人平均留粮五百零二斤，这几年逐年有所提高，去年平均每人留粮已达五百四十四斤。今年每人留粮水平又可以比去年略为提高。

    历史上以穷困著名的甘肃省，解放以来农民的粮食逐年增加。根据甘肃省统计局对不同类型地区的七百八十户农户收支调查：每人平均粮食消费量1954年是四百四十七点六斤（其中细粮一百六十七点二斤），1956年是四百七十七点二斤（其中细粮一百八十一点八斤），比城市和工矿区人民的粮食消费标准还高。这说明农民在国家征购以后留下的粮食不但够吃，而且有余。
    甘肃省农民原来大部分过的是半年糠菜半年粮的生活。解放以来，全省人口由一千零七万人迅速增加到一千四百一十六万人。但是粮食生产成绩显著，1956年全省粮食总产量比解放初期增加了一倍多。因此，农民的生活一年比一年有所改善，国家征购后农民留下的粮食一年比一年增加。从1953年农民在征购后的留粮（包括口粮、饲料粮、种子粮，下同）平均每人有四百二十三斤，以后逐年的留粮是四百九十五斤，五百三十三斤，七百三十七斤。如果将各年国家回销到农村的粮食计算进去，1953年平均每一农业人口为四百五十四斤，1954年为五百二十九斤，1955年为五百八十斤，1956年为七百八十六斤。
