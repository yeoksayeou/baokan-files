Xinhua News Agency Special Dispatch: The Beijing Second Municipal People's Congress, Second Session, has held general discussions for another four days. Under the overwhelming counterattack of more than six hundred people's representatives, some rightists have begun to confess their crimes to the people.

In the past few days of the conference, representatives have continued to expose the crimes of the bourgeois rightists in attacking the Party and socialism. Bai Wenhua, Deputy Secretary-General of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, pointed out: The rightists are extremely jealous and unwilling to accept the Chinese Communist Party's leadership of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. They openly clamor to abolish the Party's leadership over the army and secretly develop organizations and conduct activities in the Beijing-based troops in the name of democratic parties. They also used the "Drama Newspaper" and "Literary Newspaper" to incite literary and art workers in the military to oppose the leadership of the Party and political organs in the military over literary and artistic work, attempting to open a breach in the literary and art departments to attack the military. Bai Wenhua pointed out that the chief string-pullers of this criminal activity are Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Huang Shaohong, Tan Tiwu, and Li Jiansheng.

Wang Zizhong, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee of Christianity, Chen Wenwei, General Secretary of the Beijing YWCA, and Yin Jizeng, Pastor of Gulou West Church of the Church of Christ in China, revealed the conspiratorial activities of the rightists in religious circles in a joint speech. They pointed out that Chen Xingui, a confidant of the Zhang-Luo alliance, used the Beijing Christian publication "Tianjia" to vigorously exaggerate the poor implementation of religious policies and incite dissatisfaction among Christians in rural areas towards the Communist Party. Rightist elements such as Chen Xingui also openly slandered progressive elements within Christianity as criminals who built walls. The three representatives pointed out that the rightists' aim is to vainly attempt to undermine the patriotic great unity of Christians with the people of the whole country and to sabotage the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of Christians.

Wang Zhixiang, Consultant of the Legislative Affairs Bureau of the State Council, and Lao Junzhan, Deputy Director of the Beijing Branch of the Jiusan Society, pointed out in their speeches that the anti-rightist struggle of the Jiusan Society has been going on for more than a month, but very few grassroots organizations have truly taken action, mainly because there are rightist elements in the leadership of the society, and serious right-leaning emotions and leniency prevail. They also criticized the leadership of the society for unilaterally emphasizing the development of the organization in the previous period and preparing to develop the number of national members to 10,000 to 15,000 by the end of 1957, thus emphasizing quantity over quality in development, making the Jiusan Society a breeding ground for reactionary political capital.

Regarding the rightist elements who have been exposed, the representatives also pressed home the attack, demanding that the rightist elements thoroughly confess to the people. Under such circumstances, some rightist elements began to confess their crimes to the people. Xue Yu admitted in his self-criticism that he wanted to gradually usurp the Party's leadership in pharmacy. He admitted that he was engaged in academic activities on the one hand and social activities on the other to increase his own capital. Qian Duansheng also admitted that he was a political ambitionist flaunting the banner of "scholar," admitted that his actions were under the leadership of the Zhang-Luo alliance, and admitted that he had close contact with Fairbank, an American spy disguised as an "expert in modern Chinese history," since 1937, and that there was still correspondence between them after liberation. However, he has not yet made a profound self-criticism of his reactionary activities. However, there are still some rightist elements who still want to resist stubbornly. Tan Tiwu, a rightist element who has always refused to confess reactionary remarks and scolded people's representatives, was extremely dishonest in her self-criticism. She said that the mistake in her relationship with Lin Xiling was "liberalism," and she even expressed that she wanted to "draw a clear line" with Huang Shaohong. The representatives expressed great indignation at her attitude of refusing to confess her crimes. When she spoke, the presidium of the conference received ninety notes protesting her self-criticism, demanding that she bow her head and admit her guilt and not isolate herself from the people.

In the speeches these days, the representatives emphasized the necessity of intensifying ideological remolding of intellectuals in the future. Mei Lanfang, Dean of the Chinese Academy of Traditional Opera and Dean of the China Peking Opera Theatre, said that due to the influence of the old society in the past, our colleagues in the opera circles are often obsessed with pursuing the bourgeois lifestyle and personal fame and profit, and have been eroded by the ideology of the bourgeoisie and the feudal class. Since liberation, although our colleagues have experienced several political movements, they have never been more directly involved in the fiery struggle, and coupled with insufficient understanding of the necessity of ideological remolding, their conscious efforts in political training and learning are not enough. They often overestimate their own progress, and some even think that they are "incarnations of the working class." In fact, their own old thoughts and old consciousness have not been well transformed, so they often feel unaccustomed to the new society's new system and new life, and some even have serious resistance emotions. Once they encounter a major political storm, it is easy to reveal their true colors, waver, and even hit it off with rightist elements and be dragged into the mire. Mei Lanfang hoped that his colleagues in the opera circles would no longer procrastinate and delay, intensify the remolding of old thoughts and old consciousness, and launch a struggle between socialist and collectivist ideology and bourgeois individualism.

The meeting will continue.

### 北京市人民代表大会继续大会发言  揭露右派向解放军进攻的阴谋  钱端升承认解放后和美国特务“还有信件来往”

    北京市人民代表大会继续大会发言
    揭露右派向解放军进攻的阴谋
    钱端升承认解放后和美国特务“还有信件来往”
    本报特约新华社专稿　北京市第二届人民代表大会第二次会议的大会讨论又进行了四天，在六百余人民代表声势浩大的反击下，一些右派分子开始向人民认罪。
    几天的会议中，代表们继续揭露了资产阶级右派分子向党、向社会主义进攻的罪恶。中国人民解放军总政治部副秘书长白文华指出：右派分子对中国共产党领导中国人民解放军十分嫉妒，十分不甘心，他们公开叫嚣要取消党对军队的领导，并且以民主党派的名义鬼鬼祟祟在驻京部队里发展组织和进行活动。他们并利用“戏剧报”、“文艺报”煽动部队文艺工作者，反对军队的党和政治机关对军队文艺工作的领导，想在文艺部门打开一个向军队进攻的缺口。白文华指出：这个罪恶活动总牵线人是章伯钧、罗隆基、黄绍竑、谭惕吾、李健生等。
    北京市基督教三自爱国运动委员会主席、燕京神学院院务主席王梓仲，北京基督教女青年会总干事陈文渭，中华基督教会鼓楼西堂牧师殷继增三位代表的联合发言中揭露了右派分子在宗教界的阴谋活动。他们指出：章罗联盟亲信陈新桂利用北京基督教刊物“田家”大肆渲染宗教政策贯彻不好，煽动农村中的基督教徒对共产党的不满。陈新桂等右派分子还公开污蔑基督教内进步分子是筑墙的罪人。三位代表指出右派分子的目的就是妄想破坏基督教徒同全国人民爱国大团结，破坏基督徒的三自爱国运动。
    国务院法制局顾问王之相、九三学社北京分社副主任劳君展在发言中指出：九三学社反右派斗争已进行了一个多月，但是基层组织里真正行动起来的很少，主要原因是社的领导层中有右派分子，严重的右倾情绪和温情主义占着优势。他们并指责了由于前一个时候社的领导方面片面强调发展组织，并准备在1957年底将全国社员发展到一万到一万五千人，因而在发展上强调数量忽视质量，使九三学社成了培育反动政治资本的土壤。
    对于已经被揭发的右派分子，代表们也乘胜追击，要右派分子彻底向人民交代。在这样形势下，一些右派分子开始向人民认罪。薛愚在检讨中承认他想逐步篡夺党在药学上的领导权。承认他在一面搞学术活动，一面在搞社会活动，以增加自己资本。钱端升也承认自己是打着“学者”招牌的政治野心家，承认他的行动是接受章罗联盟的领导，承认他和披着“中国近代史学专家”外衣的美国特务费正清从1937年起就有密切联系，在解放后还有信件来往。不过他对自己反动活动还没有深刻检讨。但是还有一些右派分子仍想顽抗。一向拒绝交代反动言行、谩骂人民代表的右派分子谭惕吾，在检讨时还极不老实。她说她和林希翎的关系的错误在于“自由主义”，她竟表示要和黄绍竑“划清界限”。代表们对她拒不交代自己罪行的态度，表示极大的愤恨，在她发言时，大会主席团收到了九十张抗议她检讨的条子，要她低头认罪，不要自绝于人民。
    在这几天的发言中，代表们强调今后知识分子加紧思想改造的必要性。中国戏曲研究院院长、中国京剧院院长梅兰芳说，由于过去旧社会的影响，我们戏曲界同行往往醉心于追求资产阶级的生活和个人名利，受了资产阶级和封建阶级的思想的侵蚀。解放以来，我们同行虽然经历过几次政治运动，但总没有更直接地深入到火热的斗争中去，加以对思想改造的必要性认识不足，在政治锻炼和学习上自觉的努力还不够，往往对自己的进步估计过高，有人甚至以为自己已是“工人阶级的化身”了。实际上本身的旧思想、旧意识并没有很好地改造，因而对新社会的新制度、新生活经常感到不习惯，有的还存在严重的抵触情绪，一旦碰上政治斗争大风暴，就很容易露出马脚，摇摆不定，甚至同右派分子一拍即合，拖入泥坑。梅兰芳希望戏曲界同仁们不再因循迟缓，加紧对旧思想旧意识的改造，展开社会主义、集体主义思想同资产阶级个人主义思想的斗争。
    会议将继续举行。
