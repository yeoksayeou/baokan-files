Xinhua News Agency, 10th: The Democratic Progressive Education Ministry Branch's Rectification Leadership Group continued to hold meetings on the 9th and 10th to criticize Lin Handa's anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds.

    Liang Ming, deputy director of the Democratic Progressive Central Rectification Office, revealed the fact that Lin Handa supported the Democratic Progressive Chaoyang Middle School Branch, this anti-Party headquarters, in Shanghai. Liang Ming said that the establishment of the Democratic Progressive Chaoyang Middle School Branch was planted with anti-Party roots from the very beginning, because it gathered a group of people who were dissatisfied with the Party. During the experience exchange meeting of the two provinces and one city held by the Democratic Progressive Central Committee in Shanghai in April and May this year, most people believed that the supervision of the Communist Party by this branch did not proceed from the desire for unity and should be fundamentally negated. However, Lin Handa, who presided over the meeting, repeatedly emphasized that the "anti-bureaucracy initiative should be encouraged" of this anti-Party branch, and deliberately added some provocative words when reporting. Liang Ming said that Lin's position is also very clear.

    At the meeting, many people focused on criticizing Lin Handa, the Vice Minister of Education in charge of workers' and peasants' spare-time education, for turning a blind eye to the achievements of workers' and peasants' spare-time education since liberation, seeing only the shortcomings. Xiang Ruoyu asked Lin Handa to look at the past: during the Kuomintang rule, there was no special organization in charge of workers' and peasants' spare-time education at all. According to the recorded situation of so-called social education (including cultural learning and various technical learning), the year with the largest number of people was 1933, reaching only 1.8 million people (regardless of whether the statistics of the Kuomintang period were correct). As soon as the new China was founded, the number of people participating in workers' and peasants' spare-time schools reached 14 million. Now, 22 million people have graduated from literacy classes across the country, more than 1.8 million people have graduated from spare-time higher primary schools, and more than 170,000 people have graduated from spare-time junior high schools. Jin Tiekuan of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Workers' and Peasants' Spare-time Education said that Lin Handa said that spare-time education was not valued, "not queuing up," and that "there is food for dogs, but not for literacy cadres." In fact, the Beijing Municipal People's Congress made a decision to establish a special agency for workers' and peasants' spare-time education at its first meeting in 1950, and the Beijing Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China also frequently discussed the issue of spare-time education. Now the treatment of rural literacy cadres is the same as that of district cadres, and the treatment of spare-time primary and secondary school teachers is the same as that of ordinary primary and secondary school teachers. What is Lin Handa's intention in making such fallacies regardless of the facts?

    Li Xiaoguang of the Ministry of Education criticized Lin Handa's fallacy of "having a position but no power" in his speech. He said that Lin Handa's so-called "the entire Ministry of Education has a position but no power," "the instructions of the Ministry of Education do not work," and "sometimes the instructions of the State Council do not work, and a joint instruction from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council is required to be valued" are not facts. Does Lin Handa himself have a position but no power? Taking workers' and peasants' spare-time education as an example, since 1950, the Ministry of Education has held a series of meetings to make decisions on some major issues of workers' and peasants' spare-time education. Lin himself was a participant or host of the meetings. In the past few years, the Ministry of Education has also continuously issued many instructions and circulars on workers' and peasants' spare-time education, most of which were signed by Lin Handa. Li Xiaoguang said that in the past few years, there have been only three joint instructions issued in the field of workers' and peasants' spare-time education and cadre education. This was done because these issues were no longer within the scope of the authority of the Ministry of Education alone to make decisions. Li Xiaoguang questioned Lin Handa: Eliminating illiteracy is a great historical task involving all departments of the government, the People's Liberation Army, and the broad masses of the people, a cultural revolution. Is there anything wrong with the Party Central Committee and the State Council jointly issuing a decision? Li Xiaoguang pointed out that this kind of argument is essentially an introduction to Chu Anping's "Party World" argument, which is to abolish the Party's leadership. Lin Handa did not admit that he was anti-Party in his speech, but he finally said that he must honestly confess next time.

### 民进教育部支部  批驳林汉达的各种谬论

    民进教育部支部
    批驳林汉达的各种谬论
    据新华社10日讯　在中国民主促进会教育部支部整风领导小组9、10两日继续召开会议，批判林汉达的反党反社会主义言行。
    民进中央整风办公室副主任梁明揭露了林汉达在上海支持民进朝阳中学支部这个反党司令部的事实。梁明说，民进朝阳中学支部的建立一开始就种下了反党的根，因为它集中了一批对党不满的分子。今年4、5月间民进中央在上海召开的二省一市工作经验交流会上，多数人认为这个支部对共产党的监督不是从团结的愿望出发的，应该从根本上否定。但是，主持这个会议的林汉达一再地强调这个反党支部的“反官僚主义积极性应该鼓励”，在报告时还别有用心地补充一些带有挑拨性的字句。梁明说，林站的是什么立场也很明显了。
    会上，很多人集中批判身为教育部副部长、主管工农业余教育的林汉达，对解放以来的工农业余教育的成就熟视无睹，看到的都是缺点。项若愚要林汉达看看过去：在国民党统治时期，根本就没有专管工农业余教育的机构，根据有记载可查的所谓社会教育（包括文化学习、各种技术学习的人数）的情况，1933年是人数最多的一年只达到一百八十万人（且不管国民党时期的统计是否正确）。而新中国一成立，参加工农业余学校学习的人数就达到一千四百万人。现在全国扫盲毕业的已有二千二百万人，业余高小毕业的一百八十多万人，业余初中毕业的十七万多人。北京市工农业余教育局金铁宽说，林汉达说业余教育不受重视，“排不上队”，说什么“有饭给狗吃，也不给扫盲干部吃”，实际上北京市在1950年召开的第一次人代会上就作出决定成立工农业余教育的专管机构，中共北京市委还经常讨论业余教育的问题。现在农村扫盲事业干部的待遇和区干部一样，业余中小学教师的待遇和普通中小学教师一样。林汉达不顾事实发出这样的谬论，居心何在？
    教育部李晓光在发言中批判了林汉达的“有职无权”的谬论。他说，林汉达的所谓“整个教育部有职无权”，“教育部的指示下去不起作用”，“有时国务院的指示下去也不灵，要有中共中央和国务院的联合指示才被重视”等都不是事实。林汉达本人是不是有职无权呢？就以工农业余教育为例，从1950年以来，教育部召开了一系列的会议，对于工农业余教育的一些重大问题作出决定，林本人就是会议的参加者或者主持者。几年来教育部还连续发出许多工农业余教育方面的指示、通报等文件，绝大部分是由林汉达签发的。李晓光说，几年来，在工农业余教育和干部教育方面只有三次是发布联合指示的。这样做，是因为这些问题已经不是教育部一个部门的职权范围所能作出决定的。李晓光质问林汉达：扫除文盲是一件涉及到政府各部门、解放军以及广大人民的伟大的历史任务，一次文化革命，由党中央和国务院联合发布决定有什么不好？李晓光指出，这种论调实质上是储安平的“党天下”论调的引言，是要取消党的领导。林汉达发言中不承认自己是反党的，但他最后表示下次一定要老实交代。
