Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 20th. The Albanian Tirana football team suffered a defeat in their first match in Shenyang today, losing to the Shenyang football team by a score of 1-2.

　　At 5:00 PM today, an opening ceremony was held before the match to mark the Albanian Tirana football team's competition in China.

　　After the game started, both sides played particularly cautiously. It was not until the eighth minute of the match that the visiting team's forward, Gani Merja, who is good at shooting, attempted the first shot. Although the shot was powerful, it was firmly caught by the Shenyang team's goalkeeper. From then on, both sides launched fierce attacks, and dangerous situations constantly appeared in front of the goalkeepers. In the twentieth minute, Wang Youcheng, the right winger of the Shenyang team, spotted a good pass from his teammate. He ran up and shot hard, the ball flying into the goal from the left side of the opponent's goalkeeper, opening the scoring.

　　In the thirty-ninth minute, Qu Guangxin, the right winger of the Shenyang team, who often hovered around the opponent's defenders, received a high ball from the right rear and turned and volleyed the second goal. The home team led 2-0 at halftime.

　　At the beginning of the second half, the home team's physical strength began to decline, and they had to strengthen their defense, so the visiting team launched a rapid attack. In the twenty-third minute of the game, the visiting team's right inside forward, Arjanec Skënderi, dribbled past the home team's defender and scored a goal. After that, the score of 2-1 remained unchanged.

　　The Tirana football team arrived in Shenyang on the evening of the 17th.

    地拉那足球队在沈阳开始和我国比赛
    新华社沈阳20日电　阿尔巴尼亚地拉那足球队今天在沈阳首战失利，以一比二败给沈阳足球队。
    今天下午五时，在球赛开始前举行了阿尔巴尼亚地拉那足球队在中国比赛的开幕仪式。
    球赛开始后，双方都踢得特别谨慎。比赛进行到八分钟时，客队善于射门的前卫加尼·麦里亚才开始试射第一球，这个球虽然有力，却被沈阳队守门员牢牢抱住。从此以后，双方展开了猛烈攻势，守门员面前的险象不断出现。二十分钟时，沈阳队右边锋王有成看准自己战友传来的好球，他跑上去举脚劲射，球从对方守门员的左侧急速飞入球门，首开纪录。
    在第三十九分钟时，沈阳队常在对方后卫左右徘徊的右边锋曲光新得到从右后方传来的一个高球，他转身凌空射入了第二个球。上半时主队以二比零领先。
    下半时一开始，主队的体力呈减弱状态，只得加强防守，于是客队展开了快速进攻。比赛进行到二十三分钟时，客队右内锋亚列齐·斯康杰尔带球闪过主队后卫，射入一球。以后，二比一的比数一直没有变化。
    地拉那足球队是17日晚到达沈阳的。
