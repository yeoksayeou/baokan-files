    Beijing People's Machine Factory is Undergoing Intense Construction
    Large Printing Presses Can Be Produced Next Year
    Outside of Jianguomen, China's first factory capable of manufacturing the world's largest and most sophisticated printing machines – the Beijing People's Machine Factory – is under intense construction. Currently, on the factory's construction site, workers are laying the foundations for the factory buildings and making prefabricated components. It is expected that the factory will be completed and put into production in the first quarter of next year.
    According to the factory director, its main products in the future will be: high-speed rotary presses that can print 80,000 newspapers per hour, automatic letterpress printing machines for printing books, offset printing machines for printing pictorials and banknotes, and Chinese character typesetting machines. These machines are very precise and are composed of over a thousand parts. In the past, China's large printing machines relied on imports from foreign countries. After this machine factory is completed, it will not only basically meet the needs of China's printing industry, but also have some products for export to foreign countries.

    北京人民机器厂紧张施工
    明年可以出产大型印刷机
    建国门外，我国第一所能够制造世界上最大的、最精密的印刷机器的工厂——北京人民机器厂正在紧张施工。目前，在这个工厂的工地上，职工们正在打厂房的基础，做预制构件。预计明年第一季度，这个工厂可以建成投入生产。
    据这个工厂的厂长说，它将来主要的产品是：每小时可以印八万张报纸的高速轮转机，印书的全张自动铅印机，印画报和纸币的胶印机，以及汉字排铸机等。这些机器非常精密，都由千个以上的零件组成。过去我国用的大型印刷机器都是靠国外进口，等到这个机器厂建成以后，不但可以基本上满足我国印刷业的需要，还可以有部分产品出口国外。
