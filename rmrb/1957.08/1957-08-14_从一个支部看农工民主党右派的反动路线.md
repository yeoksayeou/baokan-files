Viewing the Reactionary Line of the China Democratic Party from a Branch
By our reporters Xi Ping and Ji Yin

The Shanghai Cultural Publishing House branch of the China Democratic Party (CDP) was one of the grassroots branches of the CDP that faithfully implemented Zhang Bojun's reactionary line.

Last May, the right-wing elements of the Shanghai CDP, following Zhang Bojun's instruction to "greatly develop democratic parties," engaged in large-scale recruitment to "expand their strength." Xia Gaoyang, the propaganda minister of the Shanghai CDP and a right-wing backbone, found a very satisfactory target. This person, named Qiu Biao, had a dirty history of forging documents and impersonating others, which led to his expulsion from the Shanghai Foreign Language Institute. Xia Gaoyang personally introduced him to the party. Then, through the connection of a CDP member, Qiu Biao infiltrated the Cultural Publishing House, planting a seed of anti-Party sentiment in this area where no CDP organization existed at the time.

After entering the Cultural Publishing House, Qiu Biao established the CDP organization in this unit in less than half a year. By November, the branch was officially established. From August of last year to May of this year, they developed from two members to more than twenty (including those developed outside the company), and the number of people they were preparing to recruit reached as many as fifty or sixty. From the branch's establishment in November last year to May this year, they held twelve branch meetings, eleven of which were discussions about recruiting new members.

In developing party members, this branch used the deceptive and opportunistic methods commonly employed by bourgeois political parties to the extreme. Qiu Biao, the deputy director of the branch, was particularly prominent, adopting different strategies for different targets. For example, there was an editor in the publishing house with a stained history who had been sentenced to public surveillance. Qiu Biao told him, "If you join the 'CDP,' the CDP Municipal Committee can take care of your historical problems," meaning that his past historical sins could be written off. For some people with higher status, they were lured with fame and position. For example, when recruiting puppeteer Yu Zheguang, Qiu Biao said, "You are an expert, and the CDP Municipal Committee values you very much. If you join, you can be elected as a member of the Municipal Committee and become the head of the Shanghai Film Studio branch." Qiu Biao also despicably used his editorial authority to coax and coerce some authors who had working relationships with him to join the party. He often held a contract and an advance payment in one hand and a membership application in the other, inducing authors to fill out the forms and join the party. Guo Rongting, an editor from the Beijing Sports News, was recruited into the party in this way.

After developing the organization, the right-wing elements often immediately demanded "political seats" from the Communist Party to expand their strength and influence. After this branch developed the right-wing element Xu Zhongnian into the party at the Shanghai Foreign Language Institute, they established a branch in the institute, and Xu became the chairman of the branch. Xia Gaoyang then recommended Xu Zhongnian to serve as a non-voting delegate to the Shanghai Municipal People's Political Consultative Conference. This cultural special agent and anti-Communist expert thus stepped onto the people's political platform under the wing of the CDP.

After gaining considerable "strength," the political ambitions of this branch became further apparent. Last December, the Communist Party branch of the Cultural Publishing House held a symposium for democratic parties to listen to their opinions, but these ambitious individuals disagreed with the name "Symposium for Democratic Parties" and wanted to change it to "Joint Conference of Parties," meaning that they should be on an equal footing with the Communist Party. Li Xiaofeng, the chairman of the CDP branch, put it more clearly: "Mutual supervision should first supervise the Communist Party because the Communist Party takes more actions and is prone to making mistakes." Qiu Biao said, "One cannot blindly side with Communist Party members; members of democratic parties are not necessarily inferior to party members."

These politicians staged an ugly farce of bourgeois political parties vying for power and profit and engaging in mutual infighting within the Cultural Publishing House. In addition to the CDP, there were also branches of the China Democratic League and the China Association for Promoting Democracy in the Cultural Publishing House. This spring, the organization selected advanced workers. They each promoted their own candidates, but when the discussion at the selection meeting turned to the Communist Party candidates, they immediately united to attack them, nitpicking at the shortcomings of the party members and fabricating accusations. In administrative personnel arrangements, they were even more engaged in infighting, mutual exclusion, and attacks and slanders, attempting to establish their own "sphere of influence" within the publishing house. The CDP branch was always the most active in these infightings, attempting to create a monopolistic situation.

After the Party's rectification movement began, this CDP branch became unprecedentedly active. The right-wing element Xu Junyuan first launched an attack on the Party's newspapers, publishing a venomous article in the Wenhui Daily entitled "Should Newspapers Be Run Like This?" which insulted the Party newspaper for "putting on a party member's face, without a smile," and "only preaching." At the same time, he actively encouraged others to leave the Cultural Publishing House and engage in so-called "cooperative publishing houses" and "expert publishing houses," encouraging Cao Bingyan to restore Guangyi Bookstore, encouraging Li Xiaofeng to restore Beixin Bookstore, and even drafting a list of personnel for the cooperative publishing house.

This right-wing element also ran outside the company to incite students of the former Journalism School to cause trouble, planning for the troublemakers and acting as their behind-the-scenes commander. Qiu Biao personally went to various places to stir up trouble. Once, a trainee editor named Yang from the Children's Publishing House came to solicit manuscripts, and Qiu Biao said to him, "You are still a trainee editor, making so little money. We abolished the trainee editor system here a long time ago. You must be bold in raising your opinions to the Party."

While the right-wing elements were attacking the Party, they also paid close attention to those who raised the most opinions to the Party at any time, using Chen Renbing's method of "joining the League on the front line" to recruit them. Qiu Biao said smugly, "The CDP now has a very high reputation, and many people are asking to join." At that time, the arrogance of the right-wing elements was truly unbearable, as if the Communist Party really had no choice but to cede its position to them.

The rectification of the Communist Party organization of the Cultural Publishing House was relatively normal at the beginning. Most of the masses, including some progressive democratic party members, put forward many correct and beneficial opinions, and the Communist Party branch adopted an attitude of humbly listening and rectifying while improving. However, in the later period, due to the trouble caused by the right-wing elements, the rectification was forced to deviate from the normal track.

After the "blooming and contending" at the Cultural Publishing House came to an end, the right-wing elements of the CDP branch initiated a joint gathering with the Democratic League and the Democratic Progress Association branches, without the participation of the Communist Party, to celebrate their victory in attacking the Party. But these gentlemen were too happy too soon. Before their celebration meeting could be held, the Shanghai people, who could no longer tolerate it, launched a counterattack against the right-wing elements. This celebration meeting later became a mobilization meeting for the anti-rightist struggle within the democratic parties, unveiling the prelude to the vigorous anti-rightist struggle at the Cultural Publishing House.

    从一个支部看农工民主党右派的反动路线
    本报记者　习平  季音
    上海文化出版社的农工民主党支部，是农工民主党组织中忠实执行章伯钧反动路线的基层支部之一。
    去年5月，上海农工民主党的右派分子，按照章伯钧“民主党派要大发展”的指示，大规模招兵买马，“扩充实力”。农工民主党上海市委宣传部长、右派骨干夏高阳物色到了一个很使他满意的对象，这人名叫仇标，是曾被上海外国语学院开除，历史上写满伪造证件、冒名顶替的肮脏账的人。夏高阳就亲自介绍他入党，接着，就通过一个农工民主党员的关系，混进了文化出版社，把一粒反党火种，投入了这片当时还没有农工党组织的空白区。
    仇标进入文化出版社之后，不到半年，这个单位的农工党组织就从无到有，到11月间，就正式成立了支部。他们从去年8月到今年5月，就从两个党员发展到二十余人
  （包括社外发展的在内），而准备发展的对象则多至五、六十人。这个支部从去年11月成立到今年5月，共开了十二次支部会，其中十一次都是讨论发展党员。
    这个支部在发展党员中，把资产阶级政党所惯用的欺骗、利诱等等流氓手法运用得淋漓尽致。其中尤以这个支部的副主任仇标最突出，他根据各种不同的对象采取不同的对策。例如出版社有一个编辑，历史有污点，被判过管制，仇标便对他说：“你如果参加了‘农工’，历史问题可以由‘农工’市委包下来”，意思就是过去的历史罪恶可以一笔勾消了。对一些较有地位的人，就以名誉地位引诱。例如发展木偶艺术家虞哲光时，仇标就说：“你是专家，农工市委很器重你，如果加入，可以选你当市委委员，做上影支部的负责人。”仇标还鄙劣地利用自己编辑工作的职权，软哄硬逼一些与他发生工作关系的作者入党，他常常一手拿约稿合同和预支稿费，一手拿入党申请书，诱逼作者填表入党。北京体育报编辑郭荣庭就是这样被拉进党的。
    右派分子们在发展了组织之后，常常紧接着就向共产党提出了给予“政治交椅”的要求，以扩大他们的实力和影响。当这个支部在上海外国语学院发展了右派分子徐仲年入党之后，就在学院建立了一个支部，徐一变而为支部的主任委员。夏高阳接着就推荐徐仲年担任了上海市政协列席代表。这个文化特务和反共能手就这样在农工党的簇拥下走上了人民的政治讲坛。
    这个支部在拥有了相当的“实力”之后，他们的政治野心便进一步显露了。去年12月，文化出版社的共产党支部召开了一个民主党派座谈会，倾听他们的意见，但这些野心家们不同意“民主党派座谈会”的名称，要改为“党派联席会议”，意思就是他们与共产党应处于分庭抗礼的地位。农工支部主任委员李小峰说得更明白：“互相监督首先是监督共产党，因为共产党行动多，容易犯错误。”仇标说：“对共产党员不能一面倒，民主党派成员不一定不及党员。”
    这些政客们在文化出版社内，演起了资产阶级政党争权夺利、互相倾轧的丑把戏。文化出版社里除农工民主党以外，还有民盟和民主促进会二个支部。今年春天，机关里评选先进工作者。他们各自标榜自己的候选人，但是当评选会上讨论到共产党员的候选人时，他们就立即一致起来攻击，挑剔党员的缺点，无中生有地加以侮蔑。在行政上进行人事安排的时候，他们更是勾心斗角，互相排挤，攻击中伤，企图在出版社内建立起自己的“势力范围”。农工支部在这些倾轧中始终最起劲，他们是企图造成一个独占局面的。
    党的整风运动开始后，这个农工党支部空前地活跃起来。右派分子许君远首先向党的报纸发起了攻击，在文汇报上发表了一篇“难道报纸应当这样办下去吗？”的恶毒文章，辱骂党报“摆着党员面孔，没有笑容，”“只顾说教”。同时，他又积极鼓动别人离开文化出版社，去搞所谓“同人出版社”，“专家出版社”，鼓动曹冰严恢复广益书店，鼓动李小峰去恢复北新书店，甚至已拟出了同人出版社的工作人员名单。
    这个右派分子还跑到社外，去鼓动原新闻学校的学生闹事，为闹事分子进行策划，做他们的幕后指挥。仇标则亲往各处放火。一次，少年儿童出版社一个姓杨的见习编辑来组稿，仇标就对他说：“你现在还是见习编辑，拿这点点钱，我们这里早取消见习编辑制了，你要大胆向党提意见。”
    右派分子一面向党进攻，一面又随时注意一些向党提意见最多的人，运用陈仁炳“火线入盟”的办法，拉他们入伙。仇标得意地说：“现在农工威信很高，很多人要求加入。”当时右派分子们的气焰真是不可一世，仿佛共产党真的非让位给他们不可了。
    文化出版社共产党组织的整风在开始是比较正常的，大多数群众，包括一些进步的民主党派成员在内，都提了许多正确有益的意见，共产党支部采取了虚心倾听，边整边改的态度。但是到后期由于右派分子的作乱，强使整风离开了正常的轨道。
    当文化出版社的“鸣”“放”告一段落之后，农工党支部的右派分子发起同民盟、民进支部一起举行一个不要共产党参加的联欢会，来庆祝他们向党进攻的胜利。但是这些先生们未免高兴得太早了，当他们的庆祝会还没有来得及举行的时候，忍无可忍的上海人民已向右派分子发起了反击，这个联欢会后来就成了一个民主党派内部反右派斗争的动员会，揭开了文化出版社轰轰烈烈的反右派斗争的序幕。
