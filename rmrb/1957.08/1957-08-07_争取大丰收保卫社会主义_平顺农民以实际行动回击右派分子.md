Strive for a Bumper Harvest to Defend Socialism
Ping Shun Peasants Use Practical Actions to Repel Rightist Elements

    (Our newspaper Taiyuan, 5th dispatch) Reporter Shang Kai reports: In the past month, the Party branches of various townships in Ping Shun have successively organized various large and small report meetings, symposiums, and discussion meetings, and through reading newspapers, listening to the radio, and other means, conveyed Chairman Mao's report on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, helping the masses to analyze and criticize the anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks of the rightist elements in the cities.
    The members of the Jin Xing Agricultural Cooperative in Xigou Village, the hometown of Li Shunda, a famous national model agricultural laborer, often gather on the streets to listen to newspaper readings without taking a lunch break, and discuss until late at night without getting tired. They said: Before liberation, the peasants of Xigou Village paid half of the grain they worked hard to produce in a year as rent and taxes. Seven out of ten households lived on a diet of bran and vegetables for half the year, and grain for the other half. Now the grain they eat is more than double what it used to be (an average of 390 jin per person), can it be said that life has not improved? And then there's raising pigs: Before liberation, there were no pigs in Xigou Township. After the unified purchase and sale in 1953, the whole township raised 22 pigs. Last year it raised 280, and now it has increased to 450. Can it be said that unified purchase and sale has messed things up and the peasants don't raise pigs? Guo Lianqiao, a female member of the Shuguang Cooperative in Cheng Guan, said: "Take my family as an example, in the past we couldn't even eat our fill of bran and vegetables, and we wore padded clothes that were changed to unlined clothes, and unlined clothes that were changed to cotton. The whole family of four had one rotten quilt. Now we eat millet and white flour, and wear city-made cloth and serge. Even I, a woman with bound feet, have bought rain shoes." When discussing the relationship between the Party and the masses, the vast majority of the masses believed that it had not become estranged, but had become closer. An old man named Fan Genxin said: "In the old society, the county magistrate went out in a sedan chair and the streets were closed; today the county Party secretary helps the cooperative build pig pens, the county magistrate works in the fields with us, and even more cadres from various agencies go to the fields to work. Who can blindly say that the Party is separated from us by a hundred and eight thousand miles?" After discussion, everyone came to the conclusion: "Without the Communist Party, there would be no socialism. Whoever wants to oppose the Party and oppose socialism and make us relive the life of slaves, we will break their heads."
    The vast number of grassroots cadres and the masses have expressed that they will use the practical action of striving for a bumper autumn harvest to counterattack the rampant attacks of the rightist elements and defend socialist construction.

    争取大丰收保卫社会主义
    平顺农民以实际行动回击右派分子
    本报太原5日电　记者商恺报道：最近一月来，平顺各乡党支部，接连组织了各种大大小小的报告会、座谈会、讨论会，并通过读报、收听广播等方式，传达毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的报告，帮助群众分析和批判城市里右派分子的反党反社会主义的言论。
    全国著名农业劳动模范李顺达的家乡——西沟村金星农业社的社员们，常常中午不休息，聚集在街头听读报，晚上讨论到深夜还不疲倦。他们说：西沟村农民在解放前，辛苦一年打下的粮食有一半交了租税，十户有七户的生活是半年糠菜半年粮。现在吃的粮食比过去多了一倍（平均每人390斤），这能说生活没有改善吗？再说养猪：解放前，西沟乡没有一口猪，1953年统购统销以后，全乡养了二十二口，去年养到二百八十口，现在增到四百五十口。这能说是统购统销搞糟了，农民不养猪了吗？城关曙光社女社员郭连巧说：“就拿我家来说，过去是糠菜吃不饱，穿的是棉改单、单改棉，全家四口一条烂被子。现在吃的是黄米白面，穿的是市布哔叽，连我这个小脚妇女也买上了雨鞋”。各乡群众在讨论党群关系时，绝大多数群众认为不是疏远了，而是更加密切了。有个名叫范根新的老汉说：“过去旧社会，县长出门坐轿子，禁街；今天县委书记帮助社里垫猪圈，县长和我们一块下地生产，各机关干部上地劳动的更多，谁能瞎着眼睛说党和我们相隔了十万八千里？”大家经过讨论，得出的结论是：“没有共产党就没有社会主义，谁想反党反社会主义，让我们重过奴隶生活，我们就要打破他的脑袋。”
    广大基层干部和群众纷纷表示，要以争取秋季大丰收的实际行动反击右派分子的猖狂进攻，保卫社会主义建设。
