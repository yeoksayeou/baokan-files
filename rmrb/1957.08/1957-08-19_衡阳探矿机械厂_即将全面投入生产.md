Hengyang Prospecting Machinery Plant
To Fully Commence Production

    (By our correspondent) The newly built state-owned Hengyang Prospecting Machinery Plant is about to fully commence production.
    This factory is equipped with the most advanced Soviet technology and the latest machinery. All of the factory's technical equipment is mechanized, making it the first mechanized prospecting machinery plant in the Central South region. In the future, the large and small drilling rigs and prospecting machinery parts, and diesel engine machinery parts it produces will not only supply the Hunan Province exploration team, but also meet the needs of exploration teams in the Central South region, as well as Guizhou and Yunnan provinces.
