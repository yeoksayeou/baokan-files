    "Sentimentalism"
    Ke Yue
    There are several kinds of sentimentalists.
    One type is the kind of right-wing element in disguise. They oppose various movements, especially dissatisfied with the "Five-Anti" and "Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries" campaigns, considering them too cruel. Today, when they examine themselves, they say they have committed the mistake of "sentimentalism." This kind of "sentimentalism" is fake. Why are these right-wing gentlemen "sentimental" towards counter-revolutionaries and those all-around bad capitalists, but not "sentimental" towards the working people and communists? Why did they want to strike down the core force of the Communist Party that leads socialist construction in the "Great Blooming and Contending" movement, even calling for the killing of communists?
    Another type is the real "sentimentalist." When they have not distinguished between friend and foe and cannot distinguish right from wrong, they seem like "Mr. Dong Guo," having some "sentimentality" towards the "Zhongshan wolf." However, when they saw certain right-wing elements making unreasonable demands and attempting to burn down the Communist Party and the socialist system in the "Great Blooming and Contending" movement, they also felt it was "excessive." We believe that such people will suddenly realize the "wolf" nature once they recognize it. Because if the right-wing elements' attempts were really realized, allowing certain elements who had directly suppressed the people in the past to regain power, then many kind people (including such "sentimentalists") would "lose their heads." Even if those "democratic individualists" were in power, I believe the result would not be much different from their allied brothers.
    We Marxists have clear love and hate. We love the working people and hate the system of exploitation and oppression. We are not emotionless "wooden men," but real people with rich emotions. Only right-wing elements slander Marxism as a philosophy of "hating people." In order to realize the great ideal of the working class and liberate all mankind, Marxists have not only gone through all kinds of hardships and endured all kinds of persecution, but are even prepared to sacrifice their own lives at any time in order to realize this great ideal. Is this kind of "martyrdom" spirit only for "hating people" and not for "loving people"? However, Marxists do not approve of "sentimentalism." It can be told to people frankly: Marxists hate those classes and social groups that insist on the system of exploitation precisely in order to love all the exploited and oppressed classes, all the oppressed and ruled nations, and in order to love these majority of people. Because they understand Marx's beneficial warning: "Kindness to the enemy is cruelty to comrades."

    “温情主义”
    克约
    温情主义者有几种人。
    一种人，就是某些右派分子伪装的。他们反对各种运动，特别是对“五反”和“肃反”不满，认为很残酷。今天，他们检讨起来，就说自己是犯了“温情主义”的毛病。这种“温情主义”是假的。这些右派先生为什么对反革命分子和那些五毒俱全的资本家“温情”，而对劳动人民对共产党人就没有“温情”？他们在“大鸣大放”中为什么要把领导建设社会主义的核心力量共产党一棍子打死，甚至号召杀共产党人呢？
    另外有一种人，才是真正的“温情主义”者，当他们没有分清敌我，不能明辨是非的时候，他们好像“东郭先生”那样，对“中山狼”有些“温情”；但是，当他们在“大鸣大放”中看到某些右派分子无理取闹，企图用火烧垮共产党与社会主义制度的时候，他们也感到“过火”了。这样的人，我们相信，只要当他们认识到“狼”性时，他们是会恍然大悟的。因为右派分子的企图如果真的实现了，使过去曾经直接镇压过人民的某些分子重新当权，那就会有许多善良的人们（包括这样的“温情主义”者在内）“人头落地”；即令是那些“民主个人主义者”执政，我相信其结果也不会比他们的盟兄盟弟当权差多少。
    我们马克思主义者是爱憎分明的，我们热爱劳动人民，憎恨剥削与压迫制度，并不是没有感情的“木头人”，而是有丰富的感情的真人。只有右派分子才诬蔑马克思主义是“恨人”的哲学。马克思主义者为了实现工人阶级的伟大理想，解放全人类，不独是历尽了一切艰辛，忍受了种种迫害；甚至随时准备着牺牲自己的生命而不惜，为的是去实现这个伟大的理想。试问这种“殉道”的精神仅是为了“恨人”而不是“爱人”吗？然而，马克思主义者是不赞成“温情主义”的。可以正告人们：马克思主义者正是为了爱一切被剥削被压迫的阶级、一切被压迫被统治的民族，为了爱这些大多数人，才去憎恨那些坚持剥削制度的阶级和社会集团的。因为他们懂得马克思这个有益的告诫：“对敌人的仁慈，就是对同志的残忍。”
