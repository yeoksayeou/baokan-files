    Maintaining the Overwhelming Superiority of Socialist Thought in the Countryside
　　——Preliminary Gains and Experiences of the Taishan Agricultural Cooperative in Taian County in Conducting Socialist Education——
　　Working Group of the Rural Work Department of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China
    The Taishan Agricultural Cooperative is a relatively well-managed cooperative in Shanggao Township, Taian County, Shandong Province. Through continuous rectification over the past year, the production enthusiasm and socialist consciousness of its members have gradually increased, and the cooperative organization has become increasingly consolidated. Especially since the vigorous implementation of the principles of democratic and thrifty cooperative management since last winter, and the active promotion and study of Chairman Mao's speech on the correct handling of contradictions among the people in May of this year, there have been new improvements in cadre work style and cooperative management systems.
    However, political and ideological work is still lagging behind.
    During the democratic rectification, cadres had insufficient understanding of the achievements of cooperativization, and one-sidedly exaggerated shortcomings in their work. They were afraid to criticize words and deeds unfavorable to socialism and the serious capitalist and individualist thoughts and behaviors of a few well-to-do middle peasants, and misunderstood criticizing erroneous thoughts as "coercive orders." This allowed anti-socialist words and deeds and the capitalist and individualist thoughts of small private owners to spread everywhere. Some cadres and party members mistakenly believed that "landlords and rich peasants are all the same after joining the cooperative," lost due vigilance against their destructive words and deeds, and even regarded some of the anti-socialist destructive activities of landlords and rich peasants as internal problems of the people. This allowed landlords and rich peasant elements to carry out various instigating activities unscrupulously.
        A Gust of Wind
    In this situation, unhealthy tendencies in the countryside arose. For example, on the issue of grain, last year's wheat and autumn harvests yielded an average of 420 jin of basic rations per person in the whole cooperative, which, together with the grain earned through more labor, was sufficient. However, many members still complained that their rations were insufficient. By the summer of this year, some so-called grain-deficient households were selling surplus grain on the market. In terms of the state's supply of industrial products, a considerable number of farmers had excessively high demands and abandoned the fine tradition of diligence and thrift. They believed that entering a socialist cooperative meant they should eat well, dress well, and live well, with "the cooperative taking care of small difficulties and the government taking care of big difficulties." They were overly wasteful in using things and spending money, demanding that the state supply more and more industrial products, complaining about the shortage of cotton cloth, coal, and kerosene, etc. The cooperative leadership once conducted a survey on the speed of members' living consumption and production increase: in 1955, members' income increased by 9.7% compared to 1954, and living consumption also increased by 9.7%; in 1956, income increased by 4.87% compared to the previous year, while consumption increased to 12.92%. As a result of blind consumption, seventy-eight households went from having surplus grain and money to lacking money. However, instead of analyzing the reasons for the shortage of money, they complained that cooperativization was not good. In terms of labor discipline, there was also some laxity. Some members did not work during the busy seasons of wheat harvesting and weeding, did not obey the leadership of the cooperative, and engaged in sideline occupations on their own; some did not care about the quality of their work and did not accept criticism from cadres and activists, but instead cursed people. At this time, a few lawless landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries became even more rampant, setting fires and stirring up trouble everywhere. They even said aggressively: "I have already joined the cooperative, you can't do anything to me anyway!"
    Because political and ideological work was weak, the party's rural branch, party members, cadres, and the broad masses lacked ideological weapons. Therefore, they lacked class analysis and a comprehensive understanding of this new situation. They lacked methods to struggle against capitalist and individualist thoughts and to struggle against the anti-socialist activities of hostile classes. The party's rural branch seemed to lack combat effectiveness, and cadres and the masses blurred the direction of progress. Cadres and masses who worked actively felt suppressed, and poor and lower-middle peasants did not dare to refute anti-socialist remarks with confidence.
    This situation shows that in the countryside, it is necessary not only to do everything possible to achieve victory on the production front, gradually increase production and increase the income of members, and give farmers material benefits (in which we have already made great achievements), but also to always attach importance to political and ideological work, raise the socialist consciousness of farmers, and arm them ideologically, so that they can consciously defend socialism and consolidate the socialist position. To this end, the Taishan Agricultural Cooperative, under the unified leadership of the Shanggao Township Party Branch of the Communist Party of China, launched an in-depth and systematic socialist political and ideological education, conducted class education for cadres and the masses, carried out publicity on the anti-rightist struggle, improved the socialist consciousness of cadres and the masses, and made a powerful counterattack against anti-socialist words and deeds.
      Righteousness Overwhelms Evil
    The Taishan Agricultural Cooperative's class education began in mid-June with the cooperative's Party Committee studying current affairs materials on the anti-rightist struggle. On July 3, the Shanggao Township Party Branch held a meeting of party members, and also absorbed members of the Communist Youth League and non-party cadres to participate, where the Deputy Secretary of the District Committee made a mobilization report. The report focused on the achievements of various construction projects in the first five-year plan and the great future of socialism in our country; and also talked about the reactionary words and deeds of rightist elements who used the Party's rectification to carry out anti-Party and anti-socialist activities, exposed the reactionary words and deeds of landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionary elements in the township, and called on everyone to raise their awareness, distinguish right from wrong, and use practical actions to counterattack the rightists' attack. After the mobilization report, a forum discussion was organized. On July 8, a meeting of party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and activists was held throughout the township, and a general discussion was organized. At the meeting, through recollection and comparison, reactionary remarks were criticized using personal experiences and practical examples. After the meeting, the cadres of the Taishan Agricultural Cooperative who participated in the meeting went deep into the various production teams to convene meetings of party members, members of the Communist Youth League, cadres, and poor and lower-middle peasants to carry out mobilization and discussion. Using methods of mass self-education such as recollection and comparison, they first improved the political and ideological awareness of poor and lower-middle peasants, and then carried out ideological mobilization layer by layer, criticizing capitalist and individualist thoughts. At that time, the Taishan Cooperative was rushing to drain waterlogging and eliminate weeds, and only did this step of mobilizing party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and poor and lower-middle peasants, but the extremely good effect has already been demonstrated, and the development trend of the movement can also be roughly seen. The ideological confusion among cadres and the masses has basically been reversed, and the socialist righteousness has overwhelmed the capitalist evil.
      Recognizing Matters of Principle
    The most obvious and important gain is that it has improved the socialist consciousness of rural party members, cadres, and the masses, fundamentally drawn a political and ideological line between the two roads of socialism and capitalism from a fundamental standpoint, distinguished right from wrong, and clarified the direction. Cadres and the masses used their own experiences and concrete facts to denounce the anti-communist and anti-socialist remarks of rightist elements. Deputy Director Gong Yujiang recalled that from the time he was thirteen years old, his family of three worked for the landlord without any hope. It was not until the Communist Party came, distributed land and houses, and organized mutual aid teams and cooperatives, that he completely turned over and lived a better and better life. He calculated an account: out of 793 households in the whole cooperative, 114 used to beg for food, but now there are none. Since the establishment of the cooperative, more than 400 new tiled houses have been built, every family has a thermos, and more than 80% of households have mosquito nets. The conclusion of everyone is: it is not that socialism is bad and the lives of farmers have not improved, but that they have improved step by step, and they are eating and dressing warmly. The rightist elements are lying when they say that the lives of farmers have not improved. The previously spread remarks that cadres "eat unjust food" and that Communist Party members do not serve the people, which damaged the relationship between cadres and the masses, were also refuted. Some members said: "We have suffered under the Kuomintang, landlords, Japanese devils, and the home-returning corps in the past. Which dynasty could be like today, where cadres are like a family with the common people, doing good things for the masses from morning to night and participating in production labor!"
    The poor and lower-middle peasants became more active; the well-to-do middle peasants who used to say that the cooperative was not good began to change their attitudes; and the landlords and rich peasant elements became honest on the surface. Some of the poor and lower-middle peasants who used to say some dissatisfied words about the cooperative and unified purchase and sale, and scolded the cadres, consciously made self-criticisms, realizing that in the past they unknowingly followed the landlords, rich peasants, and those who were dissatisfied with socialism, and said the same things without distinguishing right from wrong. Member Jiang Fangshu said: "I have lived for seventy-eight years and have not experienced such a society. In the past, our village had 180 households, and the nine landlords occupied half of the land. How could we poor and lower-middle peasants live? Now it is getting better and better, and when it is good, we want it to be even better, and we are not satisfied, and we demand too much."
    The passive and difficult-fearing mood of some cadres has also been fundamentally reversed. Wang Litai, the deputy director of the Taishan Cooperative, once expressed his unwillingness to continue working because he was scolded by a team member during the summer harvest. This time, he reviewed this passive mood. He said: "I have always insisted on stepping down and not working, which is completely automatically withdrawing from the socialist position and letting the landlords and rich peasants occupy it. This kind of thinking is extremely dangerous." In general, party members, cadres, and activists consciously reviewed that they had not played their due role in their past work, and expressed that if they heard erroneous remarks about the cooperative and unified purchase and sale in the future, they would reason with him. Some said: "In the past, we regarded the destructive remarks of landlords and rich peasants as internal problems, but now we must resolutely struggle against their destructive activities."
    The work enthusiasm of cadres and party members has been improved, and the mood of the masses has also been as high as during the high tide of cooperativization. Everyone excitedly put forward the slogan: "Treat the fields as battlefields, hoes as swords, sell more grain, eliminate weeds, support the country, support the disaster areas, and use practical actions to fight against the rightists." The original grain sales task of the Taishan Cooperative was reduced from 300,000 jin to 260,000 jin, but now it has sold 320,000 jin, exceeding the task determined by the county. Concrete measures have been taken to strive for a bumper autumn harvest. The production enthusiasm of the masses is very high, and those who were unwilling to work in the past are now actively working.
        Several Experiences
    From the preliminary situation of the Taishan Cooperative's socialist education, we have the following experiences:
    First, to do a good job in rural work, maintain socialist achievements, and develop the socialist cause, we must always attach importance to socialist education and maintain the overwhelming superiority of socialist thought in the countryside. Ignoring this issue will not guarantee the various tasks in the countryside and guarantee the consolidation and advancement of the socialist cause.
    Second, we must firmly implement the Party's class line of relying on poor peasants (including lower-middle peasants), consolidating the unity of middle peasants, and developing cooperatives in the countryside. By firmly grasping this class line, our strength in the countryside will be enormous, the forces opposing socialism will be completely isolated, and we will be invincible. At present, in terms of the allocation of the main leadership forces of the cooperative in the organization, it is generally said that more attention is paid to this issue; but less attention is paid to the allocation of leading backbones in the production team. What has been done especially insufficiently is socialist education for poor and lower-middle peasants. This is worthy of attention.
    Third, adopting the method of recollection and comparison to carry out socialist education, and linking the new political and ideological content with the immediate interests of farmers' personal experiences, is an effective method of educating farmers. In terms of steps, we should grasp the ideological mobilization from within the Party to outside the Party, from poor and lower-middle peasants to general upper-middle peasants, and carry it out in depth layer by layer.

    保持社会主义思想在农村的压倒优势
　　——泰安县泰山农业社进行社会主义教育的初步收获和体会——
　　中共山东省委农村工作部工作组
    泰山农业社，是山东省泰安县上高乡办得比较好的一个合作社。这个社经过去年一年来的不断整顿，社员的生产积极性和社会主义觉悟逐步提高，合作社组织也日益巩固。特别是从去年冬季大力贯彻民主办社和勤俭办社方针、今年5月份积极宣传和学习毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的讲话以来，在干部作风、合作社的管理制度等方面，更有了新的改进。
    但是，政治思想工作还是落后的。
    在民主整社中，干部对合作化的成绩认识不足，而片面地夸大了工作上的缺点；对于不利于社会主义的言行和少数富裕中农的严重的资本主义、个人主义思想和行为，也不敢批判，把批判错误思想也误解为“强迫命令”。这就使得一些反社会主义的言行和小私有者的资本主义、个人主义思想，到处泛滥。一些干部党员，误认为“地主、富农入了社，都一样了”，对他们的破坏言行失去应有的警惕，甚至把一些地主、富农的反社会主义破坏活动，也看作是人民内部问题。这就使地主、富农分子得以放肆地进行各种挑拨活动。
        一阵歪风
    在这情况下，农村中的歪风就吹起来了。如在粮食问题上，去年麦、秋两季，全社每人平均分得基本口粮共四百二十斤，加上多劳多得的粮，是足够用的。可是仍然有不少社员叫喊口粮不够吃。到了今年夏季，有些所谓缺粮户却到市场上卖起余粮来了。在国家供应工业品方面，有相当多的一部分农民，要求过高，丢掉了勤俭节约的优良传统；认为一进入社会主义的合作社就应当吃好、穿好、住好，“小困难有社照顾，大困难有政府救济”；用东西、花钱过于浪费，要求国家供应工业品越多越好，埋怨棉布少、煤炭少、煤油少，等等。社领导方面曾就社员生活消费和生产增加速度作过一次调查：1955年社员收入比1954年增长9.7％，生活消费也增长9.7％；1956年收入比前一年增长4.87％，而消费却增长到12.92％。盲目消费的结果，有七十八户由余粮余钱变成缺钱。可是他们不去分析缺钱的原因，反而埋怨合作化不好。在劳动纪律方面，也有些松弛。有的社员在麦收和除草的农忙时期不出工，不听从社的领导，自己去搞副业；有的干活不顾质量，不接受干部和积极分子的批评，反而骂人。这时，少数不法地主、富农和反革命分子更加嚣张起来，他们到处点火，兴风作浪。甚至气势汹汹地说：“我已入了社，反正你不能怎样治我！”
    由于平时政治思想工作薄弱，党的农村支部、党员、干部和广大群众缺乏思想武器，因此，对待这种新的情况，缺乏阶级分析和全面的认识；对资本主义、个人主义思想作斗争、对敌对阶级的反社会主义活动作斗争，都缺乏办法。党的农村支部显得缺乏战斗力，干部和群众模糊了前进方向。积极工作的干部、群众感到受压抑，贫农和下中农不敢理直气壮地去反驳反社会主义的言论。
    这种情况说明了，在农村不仅要千方百计地取得生产战线上的胜利，逐步地增加生产和增加社员的收入，给农民以物质福利（在这方面我们已取得了巨大的成绩）；同时，还要时刻重视政治思想工作，提高农民社会主义觉悟，从思想上把农民武装起来，使他们自觉地保卫社会主义，巩固社会主义阵地。为此，泰山农业社在中共上高乡支部的统一领导下，开展了一次深入的系统的社会主义政治思想教育，向干部、群众进行了阶级教育，开展了反右派斗争的宣传，提高了干部、群众的社会主义觉悟，对反社会主义言行作了有力的反击。
      正气压倒邪气
    泰山农业社进行阶级教育，是从6月中旬社的中共支委学习反右派斗争的时事材料开始的。7月3日，上高乡乡支部召开了党员大会，并吸收团员、非党员干部参加，由区委副书记作了动员报告。报告着重谈了第一个五年计划中各项建设的成就和我国社会主义的远大前途；并谈了右派分子利用党的整风进行反党反社会主义的反动言行，揭露了本乡的地主富农反革命分子的反动言行，号召大家提高觉悟，明辨是非，以实际行动来反击右派的进攻。在动员报告后，组织了座谈讨论。7月8日又召开了全乡的党团员积极分子会议，组织大会讨论。会上通过回忆对比，用亲身体会、实际实例批驳了反动言论。会后，泰山农业社参加了会议的干部即深入到各个生产队，召开生产队的党员、团员、干部和贫农、下中农会议，进行动员，座谈讨论。运用回忆对比等群众自我教育的方法，首先提高贫农、下中农的政治思想觉悟，接着层层深入进行思想发动，批判了资本主义、个人主义思想。当时泰山社正在突击排涝、消灭草荒，只是做了发动党团员和贫农下中农这一步工作，但极为良好的效果已经表现出来了，运动的发展趋势也大体可以看出来了。在干部和群众中的思想混乱状况，基本上变过来了，社会主义的正气把资本主义的邪气压倒了。
      认清大是大非
    最明显而又最重要的收获，是提高了农村党员、干部和群众的社会主义觉悟，从根本立场上划清了社会主义和资本主义两条道路的政治思想界限，分清了是非，明确了方向。干部群众都以亲身经历、具体事实，来痛斥右派分子反共反社会主义的言论。副主任巩玉江回忆起从他十三岁起，一家三口人给地主扛活，没有奔头；到共产党来了，分了土地房子，组织互助组合作社，才彻底翻了身，日子越过越好。他算了一笔账：全社七百九十三户，过去有一百一十四户要饭的，现在一户也没有了。从办合作社以后，新盖四百多间瓦房，家家使上暖水瓶，80％以上的户挂上了蚊帐，姑娘们穿上了花细布。大家的结论是：不是什么社会主义不好，农民生活没有提高，而是步步提高了，吃饱穿暖了。右派分子说农民生活没有提高是昧着良心在说瞎话。原来散布着的所谓干部“吃冤枉饭”，共产党员不为人民服务等破坏干群关系的言论，也遭到了驳斥。有的社员说：“咱们过去受国民党、地主、日本鬼子、还乡团的罪，哪个朝代能像今天这样，干部同老百姓一家人样，从早到晚为群众办好事，还参加生产劳动！”
    贫农下中农更加积极了；原来说合作社不好的富裕中农，开始改变了态度；地主富农分子表面老实了。贫农下中农中有些人过去对合作社、统购统销说些不满意话的，骂了干部的，都自觉地作了检讨，觉悟到过去不知不觉跟着地主、富农和对社会主义不满的人，不分青红皂白，说了一样的话。社员江芳树说：“我活了七十八岁，没有经过这样的社会。过去咱庄一百八十户，九户地主占去一半地，那有咱们贫农下中农过的？现在是越好越想好，好了不满足，要求的太高了。”
    部分干部的消极畏难情绪也根本扭转了。泰山社的副主任王立太，因在夏收中被一个队员骂了，曾一度表示不愿干了，这次他检讨了这种消极情绪。他说：“我过去一直坚持下台不干了，这完全是自动退出社会主义阵地，叫地主富农去占领。这种思想真危险到极点了。”一般的党员、干部和积极分子都自觉地检查过去工作中未起到应有的作用，表示：今后再听到对合作社、统购统销的错误言论，要同他评评理了。有的说：“过去把地主富农的破坏言论，也当作是内部问题，现在要同他们的破坏活动作坚决斗争。”
    干部党员的工作积极性提高了，群众的情绪也就像合作化高潮时候一样高涨起来。大家振奋地提出了口号：“把田地当战场，锄头当刀枪，多卖粮食，消灭草荒，支援国家，支援灾区，用实际行动同右派作斗争。”泰山社原来售粮任务由三十万斤下降到二十六万斤，现在已卖到三十二万斤，超过了县里确定的任务。在争取秋季丰收上，已采取了具体措施。群众生产情绪非常高，原来不愿出勤的，都积极出勤了。
        几点体会
    从泰山社进行社会主义教育的初步情况来看，我们有以下几点体会：
    第一，要做好农村工作，保持社会主义成果，发展社会主义事业，必须经常地重视社会主义教育，保持社会主义思想在农村中的压倒优势。忽视这个问题，就不能保证农村各项工作，保证社会主义事业巩固前进。
    第二，必须坚定地贯彻执行党在农村中依靠贫农（包括下中农）、巩固地团结中农、发展合作社的阶级路线。紧紧地掌握这条阶级路线，我们在农村中的力量就巨大无比，反对社会主义的力量就会完全孤立，我们就会立于不败之地。目前在组织上，对于合作社的主要领导力量的配备上，一般的说是比较注意这个问题的；但在生产队的领导骨干配备上就注意的比较差了。做的特别不够的，是对贫农下中农的社会主义教育。这是值得引起重视的。
    第三，采取回忆对比的方法进行社会主义教育，把新的政治思想内容同农民亲身体会的切身利害联系起来，这是教育农民的一种有效的方法。在步骤上应当掌握由党内到党外，由贫农、下中农进一步到一般上中农，层层深入地进行思想发动。
