(Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 28th) TASS Moscow, August 27th: The Soviet magazine "Kommunist" recently published its twelfth issue, containing a speech by Nikita Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, on the subject of Soviet literature and art.

In his speech, Khrushchev pointed out that the main guideline for the development of literature and art is: Literature and art should always maintain an inseparable connection with the life of the people, correctly reflect the rich and varied socialist reality, and clearly and convincingly display the Soviet people's great reform activities, their noble ideals and goals, and their lofty moral qualities.

Khrushchev added that the greatest social significance of literature and art lies in mobilizing the people to strive for new achievements in communist construction.

Khrushchev spoke on the issue of literature and art at the meeting of writers held by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on May 13th of this year, the reception for writers, artists, sculptors, and composers on May 19th, and the meeting of Party activists held in July. The magazine "Kommunist" published a summary of these speeches under the title "Literature and Art Must Maintain Close Ties with the Life of the People."

Khrushchev pointed out that the most important task of our ideological workers is to understand, comprehend, and correctly explain the essence of the great socialist transformation.

Literary and Art Workers Should Reflect Great Historical Changes and Create Realistic Images of New People
He said that the current reorganization of economic management institutions will bring the Soviet people more than just material benefits. It will also cause further prosperity in culture because cultural forces will be distributed more rationally, and the centers of economic regions will become cultural centers more rapidly. However, some writers show a lack of understanding of the new changes in national life. They are not adequately prepared to correctly assess the state of the national economy at this stage, when there is an urgent need to improve the form of industrial management. He said that life will soon show these comrades that they are wrong.

Khrushchev emphasized that literary and art workers have not yet truly vividly reflected the great historical changes that have taken place in the lives of the people of the republics during the Soviet era. Strengthening ties between writers and the daily lives of the people and their labor activities will help writers overcome outdated views of Soviet people, understand their hearts, their character, aspirations, and desires, and create realistic and vivid images of their contemporaries in their works.

The Opposition to the Cult of Personality Cannot Be Distorted into a Denial of the Great Achievements of the Soviet Union
Khrushchev then pointed out that, in the midst of intense ideological struggle, Soviet intellectuals have shown themselves to be politically mature, firm, and loyal to the ideas of Marxism-Leninism. However, among them, there are still some individuals who show some wavering in estimating a series of complex ideological issues related to overcoming the consequences of the cult of personality.

Khrushchev pointed out that Stalin made many mistakes in his later years, but he also did many beneficial things for our country, our party, and the entire international workers' movement.

Khrushchev then talked about the reflection of the struggle against the cult of personality on the literary and artistic front. He said that, in terms of ideological work, the criticism of the cult of personality and the elimination of the consequences of the cult of personality have already caused profound feelings and serious reflection among creative workers, especially among writers, which is quite natural.

He also said that among the writers, those comrades who were closest to the Party, to the Party Central Committee, that is to say, to Stalin, felt it especially deeply. In the works of these writers, the struggle and victory of the Party and the people are described truthfully and objectively. In these works, the image of Comrade Stalin is also often seen. The authors of these works did a good thing. They hoped that our Party would be good. They struggled alongside the entire people under the leadership of the Party for the noble communist ideals. Of course, in many cases, under the influence of the general situation during the period of the cult of personality, the depiction of Stalin's personality in literary and artistic works was not objective or one-sided, overemphasizing his achievements, while the role of the Party and the role of the people were not adequately reflected.

Khrushchev said that, during the period of criticism of the cult of personality, some writers felt as if all their past creative work was incorrect. In the intellectual circles, there are also such people who did not actively participate in socialist construction in the past, but now they begin to slander and insult the literary and artistic workers who have praised the achievements of the Soviet people under the leadership of the Party. Khrushchev pointed out that they came up with and widely used the abusive term "varnishers of reality," and anyone who truthfully described reality, described the creative labor of the people and their great victories was labeled with this tag.

The Task of Writers is Not Mainly to Talk About the Dark Side; the Good Side of Life is the Main Aspect
Khrushchev said that there are also some writers and artists who sometimes lose their position, get lost, and treat the tasks of literature and art incorrectly and distortedly. These people try to see things as if the task of literature and art is to find shortcomings, mainly to talk about the dark side of life and the undesirable phenomena, without mentioning all the good things. However, precisely the good side of life, the new progressive side, is the main aspect of the thriving practice in socialist society.

Khrushchev pointed out that the Communist Party has always supported healthy criticism and self-criticism and used it as an effective method of construction. He said: The whole question lies in what position and with what purpose the criticism is carried out. We expose and criticize shortcomings and errors in order to eliminate these obstacles on our road, in order to further consolidate the Soviet system and the positions of the Communist Party, and ensure new victories and faster progress. And some literary figures, when criticizing shortcomings, show that they do not understand life, do not have the necessary political experience, and are not good at seeing the main and decisive side of life. They seize on the shortcomings and errors of some staff members, mix everything together without analysis, scaring themselves and scaring others.

Khrushchev said that the writer Dudintsev fell into this disreputable situation. In his book "Not By Bread Alone," which foreign reactionary forces are now trying to use against us, he biasedly cited some negative facts and made distorted narratives from a position that was not well-intentioned towards us. There are also correct and powerful writings in Dudintsev's book, but the overall direction of the book is fundamentally incorrect. Readers feel that the author of this book is not concerned about eliminating the shortcomings he found in our lives. He is deliberately exaggerating the shortcomings and gloating over these shortcomings. Such an attitude towards reflecting practice in literary and artistic works is an attempt to distort reality and reverse black and white.

Party Spirit and the People's Character Are Consistent; Artists Should Stand on the Party's Position to Serve the People
Khrushchev said that Party spirit and the people's character cannot be understood in opposition to each other. The strength of socialist society lies in the unity of the Communist Party and the people. The policies of the Communist Party, which represent the fundamental interests of the people, constitute the important foundation of the Soviet social system and the state system. Therefore, it is a great mistake to think that, under the conditions of our Soviet Union, one can serve the people without actively participating in the implementation of the Communist Party's policies. Without accepting the Party's viewpoint and its political line, one cannot hope to move forward side by side with the people.

Khrushchev continued that in life, in reality, there is always something negative existing in addition to something positive. Sometimes weeds grow together with flowers. In terms of reflecting reality, everything depends on the author. If the artist stands on the Party's position, serves the people, and sincerely wishes to help the people build a new society and clear the road for the struggle to build communism, then he will definitely be able to find enough good examples in the lives of the broad masses of working people, and he will be able to resist the negative things, support the positive things, and realistically express it in bright colors. If the author does not like the achievements of his own people, he will only go to find corrupt and negative things, to dig in the garbage pits, and to pretend that this thing is a characteristic of life.

Khrushchev said that we also oppose those who depict some delicate and sweet scenes to insult the feelings of our people, because our people will never accept or tolerate any embellishment. The Soviet people oppose essentially slanderous works like Dudintsev's novel "Not By Bread Alone," and also oppose some embellishing and flattering films like "The Unforgettable Year 1919" or "Happy Life."

Khrushchev continued that, regrettably, among literary and art workers, we will encounter some "defenders of creative freedom" who hope that we will not interfere with works that distort the social life of the Soviet Union, do not express opinions, do not make principled evaluations, and do not conduct criticisms. Originally, these people were disgusted with the Party and the state's leadership over literary and artistic work. They sometimes openly oppose this leadership, and more often, they cover up this emotion and desire by publishing arguments about excessive supervision and creative restraint.

Khrushchev said that the entire history of the development of Soviet society most convincingly proves that the leadership of the Party and the state, their concern for artistic creation and artists, guarantees the outstanding achievements of literature and art, and prospers the socialist culture of the Soviet nationalities.

The Literary and Art Circles Should Launch Criticism and Self-Criticism and Unite Under the Principles of Marxism-Leninism.
Khrushchev said that we hope that all forces in literature and art will coordinate and unite on a principled basis, not on the basis of concessions and abandonment of Marxist-Leninist principles. For the sake of unity, principled criticism and self-criticism should be launched. Such criticism can help those who have made mistakes realize and correct their mistakes, stand firm, and improve their creative initiative.

Khrushchev then criticized certain literary and art magazines and publishing bureaus for not paying attention to the aforementioned unhealthy and harmful tendencies, and for not giving correct evaluations and counterattacks in a timely manner. For example, magazines such as "New World" and "Moscow Literature" published some distorted works that should not have been published. He emphasized that newspapers should be controlled by the most loyal, most reliable, politically steadfast, and loyal to our cause staff.

    赫鲁晓夫畅谈苏联文艺方针
　　党的领导保证文学艺术的卓越成就
　　作家必须接受党的观点和政治路线
    据新华社28日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科27日讯：苏联最近出版的第十二期“共产党人”杂志刊载了苏共中央第一书记赫鲁晓夫关于苏联文学艺术问题的讲话。
    赫鲁晓夫在讲话中指出：发展文学艺术的主要方针是：文艺应当始终同人民的生活保持不可分割的联系，正确地反映丰富多采的社会主义现实，明确而又令人信服地显示苏联人民的伟大的改革活动、他们高尚的理想和目标以及高贵的道德品质。
    赫鲁晓夫又说，文学艺术最大的社会意义在于发动人民去为共产主义建设中的新成就而奋斗。
    赫鲁晓夫曾先后在苏共中央今年5月13日举行的作家会议和5月19日的作家、艺术家、雕刻家、作曲家招待会以及7月召开的党的积极分子会议上谈到文学艺术问题。“共产党人”杂志以“文学艺术要同人民的生活保持紧密的联系”为标题发表了他这几次讲话的摘要。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，我们的思想工作者最重要的任务就是：理解、领会和正确阐明伟大的社会主义变革的实质。
    文艺工作者应反映伟大的历史变革，创造新人物的真实形象
    他说，目前所进行的经济管理机构的改组，给苏联人民带来的将不仅仅是物质上的福利。它还将引起文化的进一步繁荣，因为文化力量将分配得更加合理，经济区中心将更加迅速地成为文化中心。但是，某些作家表现出不了解国家生活中的新变化，他们没有充分的准备，来正确地估价在迫切需要改进工业管理形式的现阶段中国民经济的情况。他说，生活很快就会向这些同志们表明，他们错了。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，文艺工作者还没有真正鲜明地反映出在苏维埃政权年代里各共和国人民生活中发生的那些伟大的历史性变革。作家加强同人民日常生活和他们的劳动活动的联系将有助于作家克服对苏维埃人的陈旧看法，了解他们的心灵，他们的性格、抱负和愿望，而在作品中创造出他们同时代人的真实而鲜明的形象。
    不能把反对个人崇拜曲解为否定苏联的伟大成就
    赫鲁晓夫接着指出，在剧烈的思想斗争中，苏联知识分子表明了自己在政治上是成熟的、坚定的，并且是忠于马克思列宁主义思想的。但是，在他们中间，仍然有个别人在估计同克服个人崇拜的后果有关的一系列复杂的思想问题上表现出某些动摇。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，斯大林在他的晚年犯了许多错误，但是他也对我们国家、我们党和整个国际工人运动作出了许多有益的事情。
    赫鲁晓夫随后谈到了反对个人崇拜的斗争在文学和艺术战线上的反映。他说，在思想工作方面，批判个人崇拜和消除个人崇拜的后果已经在创作工作者中间，首先是在作家中间引起了深刻的感受和认真的思考，这是十分自然的。
    他又说，在作家当中，最靠近党、靠近党中央，也就是说靠近斯大林的那些同志感受得特别深刻。在这些作家的作品中，真实地、中肯地描述了党和人民的斗争和胜利。在这些作品中，也常常看到斯大林同志的形象。这些作品的作者作了好事，他们希望我们党好，他们同全体人民一道在党的领导下为崇高的共产主义理想而斗争。当然，在许多场合下，在个人崇拜时期总的情势的影响下，在文学艺术作品中对斯大林个人作了不客观的片面的描绘，过分夸大了他的功绩，而党的作用、人民的作用没有得到应有的反映。
    赫鲁晓夫说，在对个人崇拜展开批判的时期，有些作家认为，仿佛他们过去的全部创作工作都是不正确的。在知识界中，也有这样的人，他们以前没有积极参加社会主义建设，而现在却开始污蔑和侮辱那些歌颂苏联人民在党的领导下所取得的成就的文学艺术工作者。赫鲁晓夫指出，他们想出了并且广泛使用“粉饰太平的人”这样一种骂人的话，凡是真实地描写现实、描写人民创造性的劳动和他们的伟大胜利的人都被贴上这种标签。
    作家的任务不是主要谈阴暗面，生活中好的一面是主要的
    赫鲁晓夫说，在作家和艺术家中还有这样一些人，他们有时失去了立场，迷失了方向，错误和歪曲地对待文学艺术的任务。这些人企图把事情看作这样，好像文学艺术的任务就是找缺点，主要是谈生活的阴暗面和不良现象，而不提所有好的东西。然而，恰恰是生活中好的一面、新的进步的一面，才是社会主义社会中蓬勃发展的实践的主要方面。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，共产党一贯支持健康的批评和自我批评，并且作为一种建设的有效方法来运用它。他说：整个问题在于站在什么立场和抱着什么目的来进行批评。我们揭露并且批评缺点和错误，是为了消除我们道路上的这些障碍，为了更加巩固苏维埃制度和共产党的阵地，保证新的胜利和更快地前进。而某些文学家在批评缺点的时候，表现得不懂得生活，没有具备必要的政治经验和不善于看到生活中主要的决定性的一面，他们抓住某些工作人员的缺点和错误，不加分析地把一切混为一谈，吓唬自己也吓唬别人。
    赫鲁晓夫说，如像作家杜金采夫就陷入了这种不体面的处境。他在那本目前国外反动势力正想利用来反对我们的“不仅仅是为了面包”的著作中有偏见地引用了一些反面的事实，并且从对我们不怀好意的立场作了歪曲的叙述。在杜金采夫的书中也有正确的写得有力的地方，但是，这本书的总方向根本是不正确的。读者感到，这本书的作者对消除他在我们生活中所发现的缺点并不关心，他是在故意渲染缺点，并对这些缺点表示幸灾乐祸的态度。文学艺术作品中对反映实践采取这样态度就是企图歪曲现实和颠倒黑白的表现。
    党性和人民性是一致的，艺术家应站在党的立场上为人民服务
    赫鲁晓夫说，不能对立地理解党性和人民性。社会主义社会的力量在于共产党和人民的一致。代表人民根本利益的共产党的政策组成了苏维埃社会制度和国家制度的重要基础。因此，如果认为，在我们苏联的条件下不积极参加实现共产党的政策也可以服务于人民，那是极大的错误。不接受党的观点和它的政治路线，就不能希望同人民一道并肩前进。
    赫鲁晓夫继续说，在生活中，在现实中，除了积极的东西外，总是有消极的东西存在的，有时杂草同鲜花在一起生长。在反映现实方面，一切取决于作者。艺术家如果站在党的立场上，为人民服务，并且真诚地愿意帮助人民建设新社会，为建设共产主义的斗争扫清道路，那末，他就必定能够在广大劳动人民的生活中找到足够良好的范例，并且能够反击消极的东西，支持积极的东西，用鲜明的色彩来真实地表现它。如果作者不喜欢本国人民的成就，他就只会去发现败坏的、消极的东西，去挖垃圾坑，并且把这种东西冒充是生活中的特征。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们也反对那些描绘一些娇柔甜蜜的景象来侮辱我国人民的感情的人，因为我国人民是决不会接受，也不会容忍任何虚饰的。苏联人反对像杜金采夫的小说“不仅仅是为了面包”这样实质上是污蔑性的作品，同时也反对像“难忘的1919年”或是“幸福的生活”这样一些粉饰、谄媚的影片。
    赫鲁晓夫继续说，遗憾的是，在文艺工作者中，我们会碰到这样一些“创作自由”的卫士，他们希望我们对那些歪曲苏维埃社会生活的作品不要过问，不要发表意见，不要提出原则性的估价，也不要进行批评。原来这些人是厌恶党和国家对文艺工作的领导的。他们有时是公开地反对这种领导，而更经常的是发表关于监督过多、创造性受到束缚等论调来掩盖自己的这种情绪和愿望。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联社会发展的全部历史最令人信服地证实，党和国家的领导、它们对艺术创作和艺术家的关切，保证了文学艺术的卓越成就，繁荣了苏联各民族的社会主义文化。
    文学艺术界应展开批评和自我批评，在马列主义的原则下团结起来。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们希望文学艺术方面的一切力量在原则性的基础上，而不是在让步和放弃马克思列宁主义原则的基础上协调和团结起来。为了团结，应当展开原则性的批评和自我批评。这样的批评可以帮助犯错误的人意识到和纠正自己的错误，站稳立场，提高创作积极性。
    赫鲁晓夫接着批评了某些文学、艺术杂志和出版局没有注意到上述的不健康的有害倾向，也没有及时地给予正确的评价和反击。例如，“新世界”和“莫斯科文学”等杂志刊登了一些不应该刊登的歪曲现实的作品。他强调说，报刊应该由最忠诚、最可靠、政治上坚定和忠实于我们事业的工作人员掌握。
