Xinhua News Agency, August 6th dispatch: TASS reports: Soviet scientists have determined that the oil industry of the Turkmen Republic in Central Asia has great potential for development.

After geophysical explorations in the western regions of Central Asia, scientists believe that, from a geological structure perspective, the Turkmen Republic and its surrounding areas are a miniature of the Near East region, especially the Arabian Peninsula, which accounts for 70% of the world's oil reserves. The Kopet Dag mountains in southern Turkmenistan are the "oil watershed" between Turkmenistan and the Near and Middle East. The geological structure of the entire region north of these mountains is very conducive to the formation and burial of oil and gas.

Based on existing material estimates, the Turkmen oil region is part of a vast oil zone stretching from the North Caucasus to the western branches of the Pamir and Altai mountains. The oil veins in the Turkmen oil region pass through the bottom of the Caspian Sea, traverse the Central Asian desert, and then enter the neighboring republics of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.

In terms of existing oil production, Turkmenistan ranks third in the Soviet Union, after the Russian Federation and Azerbaijan. In 1957, the total oil production here had increased fivefold compared to a decade ago. Many oil wells in Turkmenistan have extremely high yields, with some producing as much as 15,000 tons per day and night.

1957 marks the year when geological exploration workers began large-scale petroleum geological exploration in Turkmenistan. More than twenty geological exploration teams are working here. From this year to 1960, they will use aerial magnetic surveys and gravity measurements to explore over 1.7 million square kilometers of land. Surveyors will traverse approximately 45,000 kilometers of land to determine suitable drilling locations.

    土库曼石油工业大有前途
    科学家证明那里是近东的缩影
    据新华社6日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联科学家断定，中亚细亚的土库曼共和国的石油工业大有发展前途。
    在对中亚细亚西部地区进行地球物理勘探以后，科学家们认为，从地质结构来看，土库曼共和国和它周围的地区是占世界石油蕴藏量70％的近东地区特别是阿拉伯半岛的缩影。土库曼南边的柯贝特达克山脉是土库曼和中近东之间的“石油分水岭”。这条山脉以北整个地区的地质构造对形成和埋藏石油和煤气非常有利。
    根据现有的材料估计，土库曼石油地区是从北高加索到帕米尔和阿尔泰山脉的西部支脉的巨大石油地带的一部分。而土库曼石油地区的油脉通过里海海底，横贯中亚细亚沙漠地带，然后又进入相邻的乌兹别克和哈萨克共和国境内。
    就现有的石油产量来说，土库曼仅次于俄罗斯联邦和阿塞拜疆而居苏联第三位。1957年，这里的石油总产量已经增加到十年前的五倍。土库曼的许多油井产量极高，有的每昼夜能够出油一万五千吨。
    1957年是地质勘探工作人员开始在土库曼展开大规模石油地质勘探工作的一年。有二十多个地质勘探队在这里进行工作。从今年到1960年，他们将用空中磁性测绘和重力测定等办法，在一百七十多万平方公里的土地上勘察。勘察者将走遍约四万五千公里的土地，以便确定适合于钻探的地点。
