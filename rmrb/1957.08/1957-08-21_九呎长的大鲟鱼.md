    Nine-Foot-Long Giant Sturgeon

    On August 19th, a shop in London exhibited a sturgeon that was nine feet long and weighed over 300 pounds. This is the largest sturgeon ever caught in Britain.

    In the fourteenth century, sturgeon was designated a royal fish by the British Parliament. According to tradition, the first right of sale for this type of fish belongs to the Queen. However, this time the Queen did not buy it, so it could be exhibited in London.

    The taste of sturgeon is somewhat like ordinary fish, somewhat like steak, and somewhat like chicken. Delicious caviar is made from the roe of this fish. (Xinhua News Agency)

    九呎长的大鲟鱼
    8月19日，伦敦一个店铺展览了一条长九呎，重三百多磅的鲟鱼。这是英国曾经捉到过的最大的一条鲟鱼。
    鲟鱼在十四世纪曾经被英国议会定为皇家鱼。按照传统，捉到这种鱼，首先该出售给女王。但是，这次女王并没有买下，所以能在伦敦展览。
    鲟鱼的味道有点像一般的鱼肉，有点像牛排，还有点像鸡肉。美味的鱼子酱就是用这种鱼的鱼白制成的。　（新华社）
