    The newest large blast furnace
    The No. 3 blast furnace of the Anshan Iron and Steel Works produced its first batch of molten iron on the morning of the 10th. All nine magnificent blast furnaces of the Anshan Iron and Steel Works have now been fully restored and rebuilt.
    People still remember the No. 7 blast furnace, one of the three major projects of Anshan Iron and Steel. It was built in 1953 with the help of Soviet experts. At that time, it was the first automated blast furnace in the Anshan Iron and Steel Works. From 1954 to 1956, this iron and steel plant successively rebuilt and restored four automated blast furnaces. With the experience taught by Soviet experts, this No. 3 blast furnace was entirely designed by China itself. Moreover, this blast furnace is also designed and equipped with newer technical equipment than the other blast furnaces.
    A few days ago, we visited this blast furnace.
    Here, what interests us most is that this blast furnace uses ore cars instead of charging furnaces to deliver materials. The blast furnace uses two ore cars on the hoist, one up and one down, to deliver materials in turn. When the ore car reaches the top, a rotating device can evenly send coke and ore to any part of the furnace, which can avoid the problem of the old-fashioned blast furnace unloading materials in a pile. In addition, there is a coke scale under the furnace for the foreman to master and change the proportion of coke, and the hopper is equipped with a gear-type automatic switch... These are new devices that other blast furnaces do not have. Almost all the equipment of the entire blast furnace, except for the blower and the coke scale, is manufactured by China itself.
    According to the design, the No. 3 blast furnace can produce 1,100 tons of iron per day. After this blast furnace is put into production, the pig iron produced by the Anshan Iron and Steel Works every day will be enough to melt more than 10,000 tons of steel. If these steels are used to roll rails, a railway more than 130 kilometers long can be laid. After this blast furnace is put into production, the iron and steel plant will be able to increase the production of pig iron by 80,000 tons for the country this year, in addition to fully completing the national plan.

    最新式的大高炉
    鞍钢炼铁厂的第三号高炉10日上午出了第一炉铁水。鞍钢炼铁厂的九座雄伟的炼铁高炉，现在已全部恢复和改建完毕了。
    人们还记得鞍钢三大工程之一的七号高炉吧。它是1953年在苏联专家帮助下建成的。那时它还是鞍钢炼铁厂的第一座自动化高炉。1954年到1956年，这个炼铁厂又陆续改建、恢复了四个自动化高炉。有了苏联专家教会的经验，这座三号高炉全部是由我国自己设计的。而且，这座高炉上还设计和安装了比其它几座高炉更新的技术装备。
    前几天，我们访问了这座高炉。
    在这里，我们最感兴趣的，是这座高炉采用料车代替料炉送料。高炉通过卷扬机上的上下两个料车来回轮流送料，料车到顶时，有一种旋转的装置能将焦炭、矿石均匀地送到炉里任何地方，它可以避免旧式高炉把料卸在一起的毛病。此外，炉下还有供工长掌握变更焦炭比重的焦炭秤，料仓装有齿轮式的自动开关……。这些都是其它高炉所没有的新装置。整个高炉的设备，除了鼓风机和焦炭秤以外，几乎所有的设备都是我国自己制造的。
    按照设计，三号高炉每天可以炼一千一百吨铁。这座高炉投入生产以后，鞍钢炼铁厂每天生产的生铁，就足够熔炼一万多吨钢。拿这些钢来轧制钢轨，可以铺成一条长达一百三十多公里的铁路。这座高炉投入生产以后，炼铁厂今年除了全面完成国家计划以外，还可以为国家增产八万吨生铁。
