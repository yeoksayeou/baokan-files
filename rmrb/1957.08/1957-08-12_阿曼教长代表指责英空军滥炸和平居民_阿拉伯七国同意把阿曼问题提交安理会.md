Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 11th - The Oman Imam's representative in Cairo, Harse, accused the British Air Force on the 10th of indiscriminately bombing the peaceful Omani towns of Rada and neighboring villages, resulting in the deaths of many women, children, and elderly people.

	Harse said that he had received a telegram stating that the British Air Force had used rockets and napalm bombs to destroy the town of Rada and neighboring villages, where there were no troops at all. He said that the destruction of Rada was so thorough that "it seems as if the town simply doesn't exist anymore."

	Harse said that the insurgents still controlled Nizwa, Izki, and the Akhdar Mountains. He pointed out that the Omanis did not attempt to defend the small oasis of Izki. (Izki has already been occupied by British ground forces.) Harse said that the Omanis intend to hold their current positions. "We understand our country, and we know how to defend it."

	Harse confirmed that the Deputy Imam of Oman, Salah bin Issa, will arrive in Cairo early next week to expand contacts with other Arab leaders and seek diplomatic support for Oman.

	Harse said that Issa is the administrative governor of eastern Oman. He is currently in the Saudi Arabian Gulf port of Dammam, acting as a liaison between Oman and the Omani office in Cairo. Issa will arrive in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on August 12th before coming to Cairo.

	Harse pointed out that telegrams from the Omani insurgent headquarters to Cairo are forwarded through Dammam.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 11th - The Political Committee of the Arab League held a meeting at noon on the 10th to discuss the Oman issue. It was revealed after the meeting that seven Arab countries have agreed to submit the Oman issue to the United Nations Security Council.

	After receiving replies from Iraq and Libya, the League Secretary-General will immediately convene a committee meeting to make a final decision.

	In a telegram to the Secretary-General of the Arab League on August 9th, Jordanian Foreign Minister Rifai said that because Jordan currently only has a consulate in Cairo, it cannot participate in the meeting of the League's Political Committee.

	However, Rifai also stated in the telegram that Jordan agreed to submit the Oman issue to the United Nations Security Council and pre-approved any other resolutions on this issue that the Arab League may pass.

    阿曼教长代表指责英空军滥炸和平居民
    阿拉伯七国同意把阿曼问题提交安理会
    新华社开罗11日电　阿曼教长驻开罗代表哈尔塞10日指责英国空军滥炸阿曼和平市镇拉达和邻近的村庄，许多妇女、儿童和老人被炸死。
    哈尔塞说，他所接到的一封电报说，英国空军用火箭和凝固汽油弹炸毁了拉达镇和邻近的村庄，那里根本没有军队。他说，对拉达的破坏非常彻底，因此“看来好像这个市镇根本不存在一样”。
    哈尔塞说，起义者仍然控制着尼兹瓦、伊兹基和阿赫达尔山等地。他指出，阿曼人没有试图保卫小绿洲伊兹。（伊兹已经被英国地面部队占领。）哈尔塞说，阿曼人打算坚守目前的阵地。“我们了解我们的国家，我们知道如何保卫它。”
    哈尔塞证实，阿曼副教长萨拉赫·本·伊萨将在下周初到达开罗，以便扩大同其他阿拉伯国家领袖的联系，为阿曼争取外交上的支持。
    哈尔塞说，伊萨是阿曼东部的行政长官。他现在沙特阿拉伯的波斯湾港口丹曼，充当阿曼和阿曼驻开罗办事处的联络人。伊萨将在8月12日到达沙特阿拉伯的吉达，然后前来开罗。
    哈尔塞指出，从阿曼起义者司令部到开罗的电报是通过丹曼转发的。
    据新华社开罗11日电　阿拉伯联盟政治委员会10日中午举行会议讨论阿曼问题。据会后透露说，七个阿拉伯国家已经同意把阿曼问题提交联合国安全理事会。
    在得到伊拉克和利比亚的答复以后，联盟秘书长将立刻召开委员会会议以作出最后决定。
    约旦外交大臣里法伊在8月9日给阿拉伯联盟秘书长的一封电报中说，由于约旦目前在开罗只有领事馆，因此它不能参加联盟政治委员会的会议。
    但是，里法伊同时又在电报中表示，约旦同意把阿曼问题提交联合国安全理事会，并且预先同意阿拉伯联盟将要通过的关于这个问题的任何其他决议。
