　　Beijing Builds Three New Large Hospitals
　　Bed Capacity Has More Than Quadrupled Since Liberation
    (Our newspaper dispatch) Beijing Municipality is currently constructing two large general hospitals and one obstetrical hospital.

    The two large general hospitals are being built in the center of the eastern suburban industrial area and in Xuanwu District, where many working people reside. Each will have 400 beds and can accommodate 800 outpatient visits per day, serving as municipal-level central hospitals. Their construction is intended to meet the needs of the working people in these areas, provide technical guidance and assistance to district-level hospitals in resolving technical difficulties, and also undertake the improvement and training of medical personnel in these areas. Currently, the main structural work of these two hospitals has been basically completed, and interior decoration is underway.

    The Beijing Obstetrical Hospital is located in Qihelou in the city center and has 250 beds. It is divided into four main sections: normal obstetrics, pathological obstetrics, research, and consultation. It serves as the city's obstetrical specialty center and is also responsible for guiding and improving the work of grassroots obstetrics and gynecology hospitals in terms of professional practice.

    In addition, Beijing Municipality is also building two new epidemic prevention stations and ten clinics in the suburbs this year.

    According to statistics from the Beijing Municipal Public Health Bureau, the number of hospital beds in the city's medical institutions in 1956 had increased from 3,001 in the early days of liberation in 1949 to 16,051 (excluding hospital beds in medical institutions affiliated with the Central Ministry of Health). After the completion of the above-mentioned two large general hospitals and one obstetrical hospital, an additional 1,050 hospital beds will be added to the city.

　　北京新建三个大医院
　  解放以来病床位已增加四倍多
    本报讯　北京市目前正在建设两个大型的综合医院和一个产科医院。
    两个大型综合医院分别建筑在东郊工业区中心和劳动人民众多的宣武区，各有四百张病床位，每天可以容纳八百人次门诊，是市级的中心医院。它们的建设是为了适应这一带劳动人民生活的需要，并在技术上指导和帮助区级医院解决技术上的困难，同时还负担这一地区医务人员技术水平的提高和培养工作。目前这两个医院的主体结构工程已经基本完工，正在进行内部装修工作。
    北京市产科医院座落在市中心区骑河楼，拥有二百五十张病床位。它分正常产科、病理产科、研究和咨询等四大部分，是全市产科专科的中心，在业务上还负责指导和提高妇产科基层医院的工作。
    此外，北京市今年还在郊区新建两个防疫站和十个门诊部。
    据北京市公共卫生局统计，1956年全市医疗机构的病床位，已经从1949年刚解放时的三千零一张增加到一万六千零五十一张（不包括中央卫生部所属医疗机构的病床位）。上述两大综合医院和一个产科医院建成后，还将给全市增加一千零五十张病床位。
