　　Nankai University Students Participate in Labor
    (Our newspaper's dispatch) During the summer vacation, many students from Nankai University went to the countryside to labor alongside the peasants and participate in the great debate on socialist ideology in rural areas.
    Currently, 303 students from the entire university have gone to the countryside. They have been eating, living, and working with the peasants for more than half a month. In addition to helping the peasants with the summer harvest, they also participated in their great socialist debate.
    The students who went to Liyuantou and Zhongbeixie townships in the outskirts of Tianjin, with the help of commune members, have learned how to weed, water seedlings, dig potatoes, and plant cabbage. Although many people were working in the fields for the first time, their enthusiasm for labor was extremely high. On the first day of labor, the second team collectively wrote the following poem: "The scorching sun is like fire, watering seedlings and weeding with bent waists, aching backs and legs make me happy, learning to endure hardship and be resilient!" Farmer Tang Zhengqin said: "You university students are really capable! You can wield a pen and do farm work."
    During breaks, some students went to the fields to chat with the peasants, and some went to the homes of elderly farmers to help them with housework and listen to them talk about their different feelings about the past and present. In the evening, the students joined the peasants in participating in the great socialist debate in the countryside. Currently, these two townships have launched discussions on issues such as cooperativization, unified purchase and sales, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and the worker-peasant alliance.

　　南开大学学生参加劳动
    本报讯　暑假期中，南开大学许多学生下乡，与农民在一起共同劳动，参加农村社会主义思想大辩论。
    目前全校已有三百零三个学生到了农村。他们同农民在一起，同吃，同住，同劳动了半个多月。除帮助农民夏收外，他们还参加了他们社会主义大辩论。
    到天津市郊区梨园头、中北斜两个乡的学生，在社员的帮助下，已学会了拔草、浇秧、刨土豆、种白菜等庄稼活。虽然有不少人第一次下地干活，可是劳动热情高极了。在第一天的劳动中，第二小队就集体写了这样一首诗：“赤日炎炎似火烧，浇秧拔草弯着腰，腰酸腿疼我高兴，学学吃苦和耐劳！”农民唐正秦说：“你们大学生可真行呀！又能拿笔杆，还能干庄稼活”。
    在休息的时候，有的学生到地头上去与农民谈心，有的到老农民家里去，帮他们干点家务事，听听他们谈谈过去和现在生活的不同感受。晚上学生就和农民在一起，参加农村社会主义大辩论。目前，这两个乡就合作化、统购统销、肃反与工农联盟等问题展开了讨论。
