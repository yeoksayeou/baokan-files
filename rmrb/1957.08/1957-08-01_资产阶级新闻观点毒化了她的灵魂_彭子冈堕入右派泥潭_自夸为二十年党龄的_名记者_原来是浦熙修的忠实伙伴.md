Xinhua News Agency, 31st Dispatch: The China Youth Publishing House has held meetings for several days to expose and criticize the reactionary words and deeds of Peng Zigang, editor-in-chief of "Traveler" magazine and editorial board member of "Wenhui Daily."

Peng Zigang is a Communist Party member who worked as a reporter for the Ta Kung Pao for more than ten years. Born into a family of senior bourgeois intellectuals, she has not changed her class stand for a long time and has always been at odds with the Party. When the rightists launched a frenzied attack on the Party, Peng Zigang, who boasted of "twenty years of Party membership" and being a "famous reporter," became even more intensified. On the one hand, she participated in activities planned by right-wing backbone elements such as Pu Xixiu and Fei Xiaotong to attack the Party, attempting to shield Chu Anping's fallacy of "Party World" purely from a legal point of view. On the other hand, she actively stirred up trouble within the China Youth Publishing House. She posted big-character posters or clamored at forums, conspiring to negate the leadership of the Communist Youth League Central Committee over the China Youth Publishing House, advocating the removal of leading Party cadres, and the abolition of the China Youth Publishing House. She also advocated stopping the publication of "Rural Youth" and demanded that "Traveler" magazine be changed to a "co-publication."

Peng Zigang also viciously attacked the personnel system of the organization, advocating that the Party abandon its leadership over the political ideology of cadres. She ridiculed the allocation of cadres by the Communist Youth League Central Committee as "achieving victory by quantity" and the training of cadres as no different from the ancient saying "learning to raise children before marrying," which is unreasonable.

Peng Zigang deliberately slandered the anti-rebellion campaign of the China Youth Publishing House as "making something out of nothing" and "alarmist," and that the anti-rebellion review was based on "mystical and exaggerated reports," and was "so left-leaning that it has no reason, not a bit of Marxism-Leninism."

After her right-wing words and deeds were exposed, she hurriedly put powder on her face, making a final judgment on herself, saying that she was a "warm, upright, and loving the Party" person, shouting such nonsense as "Comrades, rest assured, Peng Zigang is not a rightist," and repeatedly declared that if she were to make a self-criticism, she would "resign" and become a "housewife."

Peng Zigang peddled her bourgeois news views everywhere. At the instigation of the rightist Pu Xixiu, Peng Zigang wrote an editorial for "Wenhui Daily" titled "Respect News Reporters," using the so-called "Zuo Ye incident" as a pretext to slander the Party and the government for "despising news reporters," vainly attempting to incite "journalists" to rise up and voice "injustice."

Peng Zigang often used her so-called status as a "famous reporter" and "reporter" to promote "journalistic professional feelings," thereby confusing and poisoning young reporters. What exactly are Peng Zigang's "journalistic professional feelings"? From her writings such as "If I Were Still a Reporter," "They Were Fifty-Six," and "How I Write Social News," and from the materials revealed at the meeting, her journalistic professional feelings are to miss the past and old things everywhere; to be hostile to the present and new things. She said, "There are few social news now, and social problems are ignored," and that news in the Kuomintang era was "most sensitive" to social problems. She also believed that writing about model figures lacked "news value." She even degenerated to the point of appreciating the incident of the rape of Shen Chong by American soldiers before the liberation of Beijing as "social news."

At the meeting, it was revealed that after the launch of the anti-rightist struggle, Peng Zigang also secretly discussed countermeasures with Pu, Fei, and others. It was revealed that when the leaders of the China Youth Publishing House asked Peng Zigang to make a self-criticism, she also called another rightist to ask him what to do.

Peng Zigang's entire relationship with this group of right-wing backbone elements is truly intertwined, with attempts to cover up being in vain, causing great anger among those present at the meeting.

    资产阶级新闻观点毒化了她的灵魂
    彭子冈堕入右派泥潭
    自夸为二十年党龄的“名记者”原来是浦熙修的忠实伙伴
    据新华社31日讯　中国青年出版社连日集会，揭露和批判旅行家杂志主编、文汇报编委彭子冈的反动言行。
    彭子冈是共产党员，过去曾作过十多年大公报的记者。她出身在一个资产阶级高级知识分子的家庭里，长期以来，没有改变自己的阶级立场，始终同党貌合神离。当右派分子向党猖狂进攻的时候，这位以“二十年党龄”和“名记者”自诩的彭子冈更变本加厉。她一方面参加浦熙修、费孝通等右派骨干分子策划向党进攻的活动，企图单纯从法理的观点，为储安平“党天下”的谬论打掩护，一方面又积极在中国青年出版社内部点火。她张贴大字报或在座谈会上叫嚣，阴谋否定团中央对中国青年出版社的领导，主张撤走党员领导干部，取消中国青年出版社。她还主张停办“农村青年”，要求把“旅行家”杂志改为“同人刊物”。
    彭子冈还恶毒地攻击机关的人事制度，主张党放弃对干部政治思想的领导。她讥讽团中央调配干部是“以量取胜”，培养干部，无异于古人所说的“学养子而后嫁”的不合道理。
    彭子冈别有用心地污蔑中国青年出版社的肃反是“无中生有”，“危言耸听”，肃反审查是根据“神乎其神，夸大其辞的汇报”，“左得没有一点道理，一点也不马列主义”。
    她的右派言行被揭穿后，连忙往自己脸上搽粉，给自己作了盖棺论定，说她是：“热诚、正直、爱党”的人，高叫什么“同志们放心，彭子冈并非右派”的胡言，而且一再扬言，如果让她检查，她就要“辞职”，就要去当“家庭妇女”。
    彭子冈到处贩卖她的资产阶级新闻观点。在右派分子浦熙修授意下，彭子冈给文汇报写了“尊重新闻记者”的社论，借口所谓“左叶事件”，污蔑党和政府“卑视新闻记者”，妄想煽动“新闻工作者”群起鸣“不平”。
    彭子冈经常以所谓“名记者”和“中报人”的身份宣扬什么“记者职业感情”，以此迷惑和毒害青年记者。彭子冈的“记者职业感情”倒底是些什么东西呢？从她所写的“假如我还当记者”，“他们五十六个”、“我怎样写社会新闻”等文中，从会上所揭发的材料来看，她的记者职业感情就是处处留恋过去、留恋旧的事物；敌视现在的，新的事物。她说，“现在社会新闻少，社会问题被忽略了”，国民党时代的新闻对社会问题是“最敏感的”。她还认为写模范人物缺乏“新闻性”。她甚至堕落到把北京解放前，美军强奸沈崇事件也当成“社会新闻”来欣赏。
    会上，大家揭发出在反右派斗争开展之后，彭子冈还和浦、费等密商对策。揭发出当中国青年出版社领导上要彭子冈检查时，她还打电话给另一右派分子，问他怎么办？
    彭子冈同这一伙右派骨干分子的全部关系，真是千丝万缕，欲盖弥彰，引起了到会者们极大的愤怒。
