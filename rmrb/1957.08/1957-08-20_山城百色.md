    Mountain City Baise
    By our correspondent Bai Yuan
    This is a beautiful, rich, and colorful mountain city, and that's why it's named Baise. Anyone who comes to Baise for the first time can't help but admire its beauty from afar. When the bus from Nanning to Baise takes you into the green-shaded suburbs of this mountain city, and you turn from the turbulent You River to the towering banks of the clear, green river, cross the newly built high bridge, and see this small mountain city, you will know how rich and colorful it is.
    As the capital of the Baise region of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture, the surrounding mountains contain precious gold, crystal, antimony...; yellow muntjacs, porcupines, and countless monkeys are scattered in the deep mountains; large herds of huge water buffaloes graze on the mountains, as numerous as the sheep in the north. Subtropical coffee, rubber, and sea island cotton can also be planted here; tung oil trees and tea oil trees cover the hillsides; bananas, pineapples, mangoes, and countless other fruits are displayed along the roadsides and in the markets. The Zhuang people have been singing mountain songs for generations, but it wasn't until liberation that they began to see the days they had longed for.
    In the past, this was an area rife with opium and bandits. Opium grown in Yunnan, Guizhou, and locally was smuggled out from here. Baise was a gathering place for opium traffickers and bandits. In the past, the Kuomintang government and army made their fortunes mostly through robbery and opium trafficking. In the villages around Baise, Kuomintang chiefs oppressed and extorted the people during the day, and robbed opium with guns at night. The new generation living today doesn't know about these things, but Huang Shaohong, who was once the chairman of the Kuomintang's Guangxi Province and now says our world is dark and gloomy, knows it. In the past, under the rule of Huang Shaohong and his gang, there was only a small, dilapidated power plant, two small cigarette factories, and a gun repair factory that specialized in opium trafficking, robbery, and extortion for the Kuomintang government and army in Baise city. These are the "great achievements" that Huang Shaohong and his gang, who now come out to "petition for the people," built here. But all of this has disappeared along with the dirty dust of the old era.
    Now, when you stand on the colorful red soil hills here, looking at this mountain city through the lush green leaves and the warm sunlight, you see pillars of completely new factory chimneys rising above the city, and leisurely white clouds carry the bustling sounds of life in the mountain city. In this mountain city with only more than 29,000 residents, there are electric lights, running water, ice rooms, theaters, and cinemas, and various factories and mines are being built one after another. A newly built power plant is being installed with brand-new machinery. In a row of new factory buildings of an agricultural machinery manufacturing plant, threshing machines, vine cutting machines, hand-operated oil presses, and mountain plows are being manufactured for agricultural production cooperatives in the mountainous areas. Frequent steamships and sailboats sail on the winding You River. Roads extending in all directions are filled with endless streams of vehicles. Travelers from all directions pass through here, no longer carrying opium, and no longer encountering bandits in the towering mountains.
    Baise has a hot climate, and there are few pedestrians on the streets in summer during the day, but it becomes lively at dusk, with crowds of people thronging the main street built along the hillside. At this time, the most attractive thing for an outsider is the snake charmers. In a medicine selling place, dozens of locally grown snakes of all sizes are released from various kinds of furniture, performing all kinds of tricks in the hands of a snake charmer, and performing various games under his arrangement. Among them, the largest one weighs about twenty or thirty pounds, and its body is as thick as an ordinary person's wrist. When it is released from a large cloth bag, it fiercely stretches out its forked tongue, and suddenly stands up a small section of its body as tall as a person. The remaining three-quarters of its body coils on the ground, sliding with a rustling sound. Baise is also a famous area for producing large snakes. Snakes can be used to make various kinds of medicinal materials. Those who can catch snakes sell the snakes they catch to the purchasing stations of the supply and marketing cooperatives, and can earn a large income every year. It is said that the local ethnic trade company has also specially organized a monkey catching team. The monkey catching team is composed of skilled monkey catchers who surround the monkeys on the mountains and catch them in large groups. The monkeys produced locally can also be exported to foreign countries.
    Surrounding the mountain city, in that expanse of green leaves, there are dense banana plantations, where bunches of bananas are piled on top of each other; there are vast sugarcane fields; there are orchards growing various subtropical fruit trees. In the orchards, in people's courtyards, by the river, on the hillsides, and along those tree-lined paths, fruits hanging heavily on the branches are everywhere. Bright red lychees; golden longans; huge green mango trees, layer upon layer, like large umbrellas held up from the earth's chest to the sky, with mangoes hanging high above them, like the stars filling the summer night sky. On those short pomelo trees, only a little taller than a person's head, large pomelos hang on the branches bent by the weight, as if they were green chimes hung in this paradise on earth.
    But listen, the rumbling wheels pass through the main road, the mountain songs of the Zhuang people echo in the fruit-filled valleys, and the winding You River flows through this beautiful mountain city in the towering mountains, carrying the earth's exciting music. This music accompanies the people's songs, singing a name, and that name is the Communist Party. It was on this fertile land that the Communist Party led the You River people in a heroic struggle. This is the birthplace of the Seventh Army of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army during the Second Revolutionary Civil War, and the red flag of the Workers' and Peasants' regime once fluttered everywhere in the You River basin. Like every piece of land in China, this place was also once sprinkled with the blood of Communists. For a great ideal, countless communist warriors joined hands and gave their lives. Now, the efforts of the warriors have blossomed and borne fruit, the river is surging, the land is vast, and the whole world is already the people's. In the eyes of Huang Shaohong and his like, the sky is dark and the earth is dim, and they feel that such a world should be changed, and that such a "Party's world" should be abolished, and the people should only be slaves forever. But since they couldn't stop the advancing history when they held the butcher's knife in their hands, can clever words and lies overturn the entire new world? (Picture attached)

    山城百色
    本报记者　白原
    这是一个美丽、丰富而且多彩的山城，因此它的名字叫做百色。每一个初到百色的人，都忍不住在远远看见它的时候就赞叹它的美丽，等到从南宁开往百色的汽车把你带进这个山城的绿荫掩映的郊区，从波涛汹涌的右江的江边转到那一条河岸高耸的澄碧河上，驰过那一座高高的新建的桥梁，望见这个小小的山城，你就会知道它是怎样的丰富而且多彩。
    作为桂西僮族自治州百色地区的首府，在这个山城的周围，在那连绵不断的群山中，蕴藏着宝贵的金子，水晶，锑……；黄猄，箭猪，还有无数的猴子散布在深山里；一大群一大群在山上放牧的硕大的水牛，多得就像北方的羊群。在这里还可以种植亚热带的咖啡、橡胶、海岛棉；桐油树，茶油树种满山坡；香蕉，菠萝、芒果以及其他各种各样的数不尽的水果摆满了道旁和街市。僮族人民的山歌世世代代唱不完，可是一直到解放，他们才开始看到了他们所想望的日子。
    过去，这是个鸦片充斥，强盗出没的地区。云南、贵州以及本地种植的鸦片都从这里偷运到外地去。百色就是偷运鸦片的贩子和强盗集散的地方。过去，国民党的政府和军队，许多都是靠抢劫和贩运鸦片发财的强盗和贩子。在百色周围的乡村里，国民党的乡长白天打开大门欺压和勒索老百姓，晚上带着枪枝去抢劫鸦片。关于这些事情，生活在现在的新的一代都不知道了，但是做过国民党的广西省主席，而现在说我们的世界暗无天日的黄绍竑是知道的。过去，在黄绍竑他们的统治之下，百色城里只有一个小小的破烂的发电厂，两间小烟厂，和一个专门为国民党的官府和军队贩运鸦片、抢劫和勒索服务的枪枝修理厂。这就是今天出来“为民请命”的黄绍竑和他的那一伙在这里建树的“丰功伟绩”。可是，这一切都已经和旧时代的肮脏的灰尘一起消逝了。
    现在，当你站在这里富有色彩的红色土壤的山坡上，透过那一片婆娑的绿叶和热烈的阳光，看着这个山城，一柱柱完全是新建的工厂的烟囱耸立在城市的上空，悠悠的白云，传送着山城的生活的繁响。在这个只有二万九千多居民的山城里，有电灯、有自来水、有冰室、有戏院和电影院，各种大大小小的厂矿一个接着一个建立起来。一座刚刚建成的新发电厂正在安装全新的机器。在一个农业机器制造厂的一排排新建的厂房里，正在为山区农业生产合作社制造打谷机、切蔓机，手摇榨油机和山地犁。频繁的汽船和帆船在蜿蜒的右江上航行。四通八达的公路奔驰着不绝的车群。四面八方的旅人从这里路过，他们带着的不再是鸦片，在那崇山峻岭间碰到的不再是出没的强盗。
    百色气候炎热，夏天的街道上，白天很少行人，但一到黄昏就热闹起来，在那一条沿着山坡修筑下来的主要街道上拥挤着人群。这时候，对一个外来的人来说，最有吸引力的就是那些玩蛇的人们了。在一个卖药的场子上，本地生长的几十条大大小小的毒蛇被从各种各样的家具里放出来，在一个玩蛇的人的手上耍着各种各样的花样，并且在他的摆布下表演各种各样的游戏。其中有一条最大的，大约有二、三十斤重，蛇身像普通人的手腕一般粗，当它从一个大布袋里被放出来，凶猛地伸吐着开叉的舌头，一下子把一小截身子立起来和人一般高，剩下四分之三的身子在地上一边盘蜷着，一边唰唰地滑行。百色也是一个著名的产大蛇的地区。蛇可以用来泡制各种各样的药材。那些会捉蛇的人们，把捉到的蛇卖给供销合作社的收购站，每年可以获得大笔的收入。听说这里的民族贸易公司还专门组织了一个捉猴队，捉猴队里都是一些捉猴的能手，他们在山上把猴子包围起来，一捉就是一大群。本地出产的猴子还可以向外国出口。
    环绕着山城，在那一片绿叶丛中，有茂密的香蕉园，香蕉园里结满了一梳叠着一梳的香蕉；有辽阔的甘蔗田；有生长着各种亚热带果树的果树园。在果园里，在人们的院子里，在河边，在山坡上，在那些林荫小道旁，遍地是结满枝头的累累的水果。鲜红的荔枝；金色的桂元；一棵棵巨大的绿叶层层的芒果树，就像是从大地胸前向天空擎起的一把把大伞，在那上面高高地挂满了芒果，像夏夜的天空上挂满了繁星。在那些矮矮的、只高过人头的柚子树上，一只只大柚子挂在那些被坠弯了的枝条上，好像是在这大地的乐园里挂上的一个个碧绿的吊钟。
    可是，你听，隆隆的车轮从大路上驰过，僮族人民的山歌在结满果子的山谷间回响，蜿蜒的右江在崇山间流过这美丽的山城，带着大地的激荡的乐音，这乐音伴和着人民的歌声歌唱着一个名字，这名字就是共产党。就在这一片丰丽的土地上，共产党领导右江人民进行过英勇的斗争。这是第二次国内革命战争时期中国工农红军第七军的诞生地，工农政权的红旗曾经在右江流域的土地上到处飘扬。和中国的每一片土地上一样，这里也曾经洒遍了共产党人的鲜血。为了一个伟大的理想，无数共产主义的战士手挽着手献出了自己的生命。现在，战士们的努力都已经开花又结果，江水滔滔，大地茫茫，整个都已经是人民的天下。在黄绍竑们看来觉得天昏地暗，觉得这样的世界应该改变，这样的“党天下”应当取消，人民只应当永远做奴隶。但是，既然他们手里握着屠刀的时候都没有挡得住前进的历史，难道巧语谎言就能够掀翻整个新的天地？（附图片）
