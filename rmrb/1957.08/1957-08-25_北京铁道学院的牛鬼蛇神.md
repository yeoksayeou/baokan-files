Report from our newspaper:

    The right-wing elements at Beijing Railway College, attempting to seize the leadership of the school, launched a frenzied attack on the Communist Party.

    Right-wing element Liu Jingxiang was an economics professor and the head of the China Democratic League branch at Beijing Railway College. He slandered the Party committee for being incapable of leading the rectification campaign and insisted that he and Liu Chijing (economics professor) be responsible for organizing a group to supervise the rectification of Party members. Liu Jingxiang incited those who had problems in past movements and those who harbored dissatisfaction with the Party, urging them to take the lead in "pouring out their grievances." Then, at the rectification symposium convened by the Party committee, Liu Jingxiang appeared as the spokesperson for the masses, opened fire on the Party, and threatened that the rectification symposium was not meant to assess the Party's merits, so there was no need to talk about advantages, openly inciting the masses to attack the Party and negate all the achievements of the past eight years.

    Right-wing element Liu Chijing served as an economics professor, a member of the college affairs committee, vice chairman of the trade union, and a member of the Beijing Municipal People's Political Consultative Conference. Liu Chijing defamed the Communist Party as being "worse" than the Kuomintang and said, "A single color is not as good as mixed colors." He attacked the Party's cadre policy as "sectarianism," which led to "not asking about virtue or lack thereof, ability or inability," and opposed the Party's leadership in science and education. He said that the school "fundamentally distrusted" teachers, and that all previous movements were the Communist Party's "using young teachers to attack older teachers." Liu Chijing, as the vice chairman of the trade union, slandered the trade union as a "liar," an "administrative branch," and "the tail of the Party," and also said that he was a "puppet chairman," a "nominal chairman." Liu Chijing denigrated the teaching reform work as being "completely dark" and "not reformed but copied," and that the teaching reform made intellectuals "feel that there is no future." Liu Chijing opposed the implementation of the Party committee system in the school. He said to Wu Tingjun: "Democratic parties and the trade union must organize and drive the Communist Party out of the school."

    Wu Tingjun, a professor in the Transportation Department, was a key general of Liu Jingxiang. He came from a despotic landlord family. He said that the past movements were the Communist Party "making trouble" for him, and now it was his turn to make trouble for the Communist Party. He wantonly vilified the Party and Party members, saying, "In the past, I thought that Communist Party members were gods, but now I think they are ghosts." He also said, "The Communist Party is about to collapse," and "During the Xinhai Revolution, the Kuomintang was also progressive, and I also raised a flag to welcome them, but they collapsed after forty years; but the Communist Party has only been around for eight years, and it's already made such a mess." He slandered the Party's intellectual policy as "using barbarians to control barbarians" and scolded activists as "singers of the old society."

    Yan Zhongduo, a professor in the Telecommunications Department, engaged in six years of unspeakable activities on the radio station of the Kuomintang's military intelligence agency. After liberation, he registered for self-renewal, and the government had given him five years of control. He said, "The Party has nothing to do with teaching; they specialize in movements and specialize in rectifying people," and "Before liberation, I was at Jiaotong University, and without the leadership of the Party, I still studied well. Now, under the leadership of the Party, students are burdened excessively." To run the school well, "all the leaders must be replaced." Yan Zhongduo denigrated ideological remolding and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, saying that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement "had major shortcomings, and the achievements were equal to zero"; ideological remolding "had major shortcomings, and the achievements were secondary." He vilified activists as "volunteer teams building walls and digging ditches," "hypocritical," "opportunistic," and "disowning relatives, playing a bad role."

    Zheng Kun, a professor in the Transportation Department, served as a senior technical officer with the rank of colonel in the puppet Ministry of National Defense during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, a major general commissioner in the Transportation Control Bureau of the puppet Military Commission. When Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary government imposed an economic blockade on the liberated areas, Zheng Kun served as the director of the Freight Administration under the leadership of the special agent leader Dai Li and other reactionary positions. During the rectification, Zheng Kun maliciously distorted and slandered the Party and the Party's policies, and vilified the Party's leadership. Zheng Kun attacked the Party's intellectual policy. He said: "The Communist Party regards non-Party intellectuals as weeds and alien youths as slaves."

    Right-wing element Zhu Guangxin was an economics professor who often spread anti-communist and anti-socialist remarks among the students. He scolded Party members for having no "conscience" and being "hypocritical." Zhu Guangxin seized on individual shortcomings in the unified purchase and sale system, negated all the achievements of the unified purchase and sale system, and said that the unified purchase and sale system was "messed up" and that "farmers cannot get enough to eat."

    Currently, the anti-rightist struggle at Beijing Railway College is deepening. The ranks of activists are constantly expanding, the broad masses have received a profound education, and they are further united around the Party to wage a struggle against these right-wing elements.

　　北京铁道学院的牛鬼蛇神
    本报讯　北京铁道学院的右派分子，妄图夺取学校的领导权，向共产党发起了疯狂进攻。
    右派分子刘景向是经济系教授、北京铁道学院民盟支部主委。他污蔑党委不能领导整风，要由他和刘炽晶（经济系教授）负责组织一个小组监督党员整风。刘景向煽动历次运动中有问题和对党心怀不满的人，要他们带头“吐苦水”。然后在党委召开的整风座谈会上，刘景向又以群众代言人的姿态出现，向党开炮，并扬言整风座谈会不是给党做鉴定，不要讲优点，公开煽动群众，攻击党，否定过去八年的一切成绩。
    右派分子刘炽晶担任经济系教授、院务委员、工会副主席和北京市政协委员等职务。刘炽晶诽谤共产党比国民党还“不如”，“清一色没有混一色好”。他攻击党的干部政策是“宗派主义”，因而就“不问贤与不贤，能与不能”，并反对党领导科学教育工作。他说学校对教师从“骨子里不信任”，历次运动都是共产党“利用青年教师打击老年教师”。刘炽晶身为工会副主席，却污蔑工会是“骗子”，“行政分号”，“党的尾巴”，还说他是“傀儡主席”，“挂名主席”。刘炽晶诋毁教学改革工作“漆黑一团”，“不是改完了而是抄完了”，教学改革把过去的“一切都否定了”，教学改革搞得知识分子“感到没有前途”。刘炽晶反对学校实行党委制，他对伍廷钧说：“民主党派和工会要组织起来，把共产党赶出学校去”。
    运输系教授伍廷钧是刘景向的一员大将。他出身于恶霸地主家庭。他说过去的运动是共产党“搞”他，现在是他来搞共产党。他大肆谩骂党和党员，他说，“过去认为共产党员是神，现在认为是鬼”。他还说什么“共产党快完蛋了”，“辛亥革命时国民党也是进步的，我也举过旗欢迎过，搞了四十年垮了；但共产党才八年，就搞得乌烟瘴气”。他污蔑党的知识分子政策是“以夷制夷”，骂积极分子是“旧社会的歌手”。
      电信系教授严忠铎在军统特务机关的电台上，干过六年不可告人的勾当。解放后登记自新，政府曾给予五年管制。他说“党与教学无关，他们是专搞运动，专是整人的”，“解放前我在交大，没有党的领导，书一样念得好。现在，在党的领导下，学生反而发生负担过重的现象”，要办好学校“必须将全部领导人员都换掉”。严忠铎诋毁思想改造和肃反运动，他说肃反运动“缺点是主要的，成绩等于零”；思想改造“缺点是主要的，成绩是次要的”。他谩骂积极分子是“筑墙挖沟的义勇队”，“口是心非”，“投机取巧”，“六亲不认，起了坏作用”。
    运输系教授郑鵾在国民党反动统治时期，曾担任伪国防部上校技正，伪军委会运输统制局少将专员，当蒋介石反动政府对解放区进行经济封锁时，郑鵾又在特务头子戴笠领导的货运管理局任处长等反动职务。郑鵾在整风中恶意歪曲和污蔑党和党的政策，丑化党的领导。郑鵾攻击党的知识分子政策。他说：“共产党视非党知识分子如草芥，视异己青年如奴才。”
    右派分子朱广心是经济系教授，在同学们当中经常散布反共、反社会主义的言论。他骂党员没有“良心”，“口是心非”。朱广心抓住统购统销中的个别缺点，否定统购统销的一切成绩，就说统购统销“搞糟了”，“农民吃不饱”。
    现在，北京铁道学院的反右派斗争正在深入。积极分子的队伍不断扩大，广大群众受到了深刻的教育，进一步团结在党的周围，向这些右派分子展开斗争。
