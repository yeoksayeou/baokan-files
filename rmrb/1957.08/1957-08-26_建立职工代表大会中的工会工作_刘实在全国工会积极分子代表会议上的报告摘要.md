　　Establishing Trade Union Work Within the Workers' Congress
Summary of Liu Shi's Report at the National Conference of Activists in Trade Unions

　　Xinhua News Agency, August 24th. At the National Conference of Activists in Trade Unions on August 24th, Liu Shi, Director of the Organization Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, delivered a report on establishing trade union work within the Workers' Congress.

　　This report was compiled based on the trade union work experience gained during the pilot work of establishing Workers' Congresses in some state-owned factories and mines in the previous period, and the opinions put forward by the Secretariat of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in summarizing these experiences.

　　Liu Shi said that since the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China proposed further implementing the mass line in enterprise work, pilot work of establishing Workers' Congresses has been carried out in some factories and mines. These units, through convening Workers' Congresses, expanded internal democracy, exposed and overcame certain contradictions within the enterprise, improved the leadership work of the enterprise, educated cadres and workers, strengthened the unity between leaders and the masses, and promoted production and all aspects of work. The preliminary achievements of these units prove that establishing Workers' Congresses is a necessary measure for running enterprises well by using the mass line.

  The Role of Trade Unions in Establishing Workers' Congresses

　　Liu Shi then talked about the role that trade unions within enterprises should play in establishing Workers' Congresses. He said that the Workers' Congress is the main form of mass supervision under the leadership of the Party committee, and all work to establish the Workers' Congress must be carried out under the leadership of the Party committee. At the same time, the role of trade union organizations should be fully utilized. Experience from pilot work has proven that it is greatly advantageous for the trade union to be responsible for preparing and convening the Workers' Congress, and for supervising the implementation of the congress's resolutions during the recess of the congress. The trade union is the most extensive mass organization of the working class, and more than 90% of the workers in factories and mines are trade union members, who can reflect the opinions and demands of the masses of workers. The trade union has a complete working organization from the group to the entire factory, and these working organizations have carried out various activities in the enterprise and accumulated certain work experience. Giving play to the role of trade union organizations, and using trade union cadres and the broad masses of trade union activists, can organize the masses of workers to participate in enterprise management and conduct mass supervision of the enterprise.

　　Liu Shi said that some of the first batch of pilot units separated the Workers' Congress from the Trade Union Members' Congress, and elected a factory management committee as a standing body at the Workers' Congress. After several months of pilot work, the shortcomings of this approach have become apparent. That is: it is difficult to distinguish the content of the two conferences, therefore, the meetings are repetitive, increasing the burden on cadres and workers; the factory management committee does not have a set of working bodies, "it exists when the meeting is in session, and disappears when the meeting is over." It is difficult to specifically undertake the task of organizing the Workers' Congress and supervising the implementation of the congress's resolutions; the relationship between the factory management committee and the trade union committee has emerged, and the role of the trade union organization has been weakened. Precisely because of the above shortcomings, many units that have adopted this approach are prepared to amend the organizational regulations at the next Workers' Congress.

　　The report emphasized that the organization of the Workers' Congress by the trade union will not change the nature of the trade union. The Workers' Congress is an institution for workers to participate in enterprise management and conduct mass supervision of enterprise administration; it is not an administrative management institution. During the adjournment of the Workers' Congress, the trade union committee is responsible for supervising the implementation of the congress's resolutions, but it does not directly manage and organize production. Organizing workers to participate in enterprise management and conduct mass supervision of the enterprise is precisely the function that the mass organization of the working class—the trade union—must have in a socialist society. In fact, by organizing the Workers' Congress, the trade union not only reflects the sentiments and demands of the masses, but also more strongly supports the correct opinions and reasonable demands of the masses, and helps the masses abandon incorrect opinions and unreasonable demands on the basis of raising their awareness. The connection between the trade union and the masses is even closer.

How Should Trade Unions Treat the Relationship with Enterprise Administration?

　　Liu Shi then analyzed how trade unions should treat the relationship with enterprise administration. He said that the fundamental issue encountered by trade unions in organizing Workers' Congresses is what attitude to take when there is a conflict between the interests of the state and the immediate interests of workers, and when there is a conflict between leaders and the masses. The fundamental attitude of trade union organizations should be to reasonably adjust the interests of the state, which is also the overall interests of the workers, with the immediate interests of the workers, and to care for the immediate interests of the workers as much as possible on the premise of subordinating to the overall interests, to make leaders and the masses closer, and to make enterprise administration, trade unions, and the Communist Youth League more united under the leadership of the Party.

　　The report said that in socialist enterprises, the interests of the enterprise and the interests of the masses of workers are consistent, and the fundamental tasks and fundamental goals of enterprise administration and trade unions are also consistent. The contradiction between administrative leaders and the masses of workers is inconsistency on the basis of fundamental consistency, and the difference between administration and trade unions is also difference on the basis of fundamental consistency. Consistency is fundamental, and inconsistency and difference are non-fundamental. Therefore, in the relationship between leaders and the masses, and in the relationship between trade unions and administration, it is necessary to emphasize consistency, and the principle of handling this relationship is to start from the desire for unity, and after criticism or struggle, achieve new unity on a new basis. Of course, this does not deny that there are still aspects of inconsistency and difference. The Workers' Congress is to absorb the masses of workers and enterprise administration to discuss major issues of the enterprise together, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and make the understanding of enterprise administration and the masses of workers consistent. The report said that there are contradictions among the people, and exposing these contradictions is precisely to overcome these contradictions and strengthen unity. Criticism or struggle is precisely to strengthen unity. Trade union organizations should understand and handle the relationship with enterprise administration in this way, and should also educate the masses of workers to understand the relationship with enterprise administration in this way.

　　The report said that the mass supervision organized by the trade union is in line with the enterprise administration's adherence to the mass line. The main task of the enterprise is to do a good job in production and complete the state plan. This is the requirement of the enterprise leaders and the requirement of all employees. To achieve this, it is necessary for the leaders and all employees to work together. At present, the vast majority of enterprise administrations, through the Workers' Congress and other forms, clearly explain the state construction cause, the situation and difficulties of the enterprise to the masses, and raise the issues that need to be resolved to the masses. This approach has enhanced the sense of responsibility of the masses as masters, and guided the masses of workers to consider issues from the overall situation. At the same time, it enables administrative work to receive the full support of the masses. Administration strengthens the mass line, and the trade union actively organizes the masses of workers to participate in enterprise management. This enables us to further achieve that leaders rely on the masses, and the masses support the leaders, so that leaders and the masses are united to run the enterprise well and do a good job in production.

　　The report pointed out that in the mass supervision organized by the trade union, it is a kind of urging to the enterprise administration, but more importantly, it is active help. That is, when encountering problems, first conduct in-depth investigation and research, find out the various factors involved in the problem, and mobilize the masses to find solutions to the problem. Then, actively reflect the situation to the administration and negotiate how to solve the problem. In the consultation, not only should active suggestions be put forward, but also the difficulties existing in the work of the administration should be understood, so as to mobilize the masses to overcome the difficulties together.

How Should Trade Unions Treat the Opinions and Demands of the Masses?

　　The report said that when establishing the Workers' Congress, the trade union must keep abreast of the sentiments and demands of the masses. Based on these sentiments and demands, carry out propaganda and education work, actively improve their own work, and help the administration improve leadership. In this way, the Workers' Congress can proceed healthily and achieve good results. The trade union must reflect the sentiments and demands of the masses, but this does not mean that all these opinions and demands are supported. The trade union must analyze the opinions and demands of the masses and treat them separately.

　　For the correct demands of the masses, that is, demands that are in line with state policies and laws, beneficial to production or do not hinder production, and can be realized conditionally, the trade union should support and realize them. For demands that are not easy to achieve for a while and completely unreasonable demands, the trade union organization should explain the situation to the masses, organize workers to launch discussions, guide workers to consider problems from the overall situation, and enable the masses to consciously abandon these demands on the basis of improved mass awareness. The realization of correct demands raised by the masses must also be differentiated. The realization of some demands requires state funding, and the trade union organization should urge the administration to solve these problems from state appropriations and funds that the enterprise itself can use. The realization of some demands can mainly rely on the strength of the masses themselves, or can be completely achieved by relying on the strength of the masses themselves, and the trade union should do more organizational work. The trade union should inspire the masses of workers to solve problems with the spirit of building the country with diligence and thrift, and running businesses with diligence and thrift.

　　The report also said that solving practical problems should be given equal importance to strengthening ideological and political education. The workers we face are a conscious and organized team. However, due to the limitations of their work posts, the masses of workers will inevitably have certain limitations in their understanding of problems, and often some problems cannot be completely considered from the overall situation. This makes it necessary to clearly explain the situation to the masses, clarify the reasoning, and guide the masses to correctly treat these problems. In recent years, the number of new workers has developed rapidly, which requires us to strengthen political and ideological work even more. In short, in dealing with the demands of the masses, the trade union should not adopt a bureaucratic attitude—deceive, prevaricate, shirk responsibility, simply criticize; at the same time, it should not one-sidedly emphasize representing the masses, disregarding the difficulties of the state and enterprises, not analyzing the opinions of the masses, and not daring to educate the masses.

  Organizational Work of Convening the Workers' Congress

　　When talking about the organizational work of convening the Workers' Congress, Liu Shi said that the organizational work of each pilot unit is divided into three stages: preparation, convening, and implementation. In these three stages, the following tasks generally need to be done: unifying thinking among leading cadres, conducting ideological education among workers, electing representatives, inspecting work, preparing reports, organizing speeches, drafting resolutions, handling proposals, and implementing the resolutions and proposals of the congress.

　　Liu Shi explained the specific practices of these tasks in the report one by one, and emphasized that all these tasks are carried out under the unified leadership of the enterprise Party committee. The trade union must closely rely on the leadership of the Party committee, assist the enterprise administration to actively inspect and summarize the work, earnestly improve the work style, and achieve full promotion of democracy, so that the elected representatives have a wide range of mass participation, and everyone can speak freely at the meeting. The factory director's work report, the resolutions of the conference, etc., should be submitted to the worker representatives in advance for discussion, and the trade union should actively organize this discussion, so that the report and resolutions can fully reflect the demands of the masses and be more practical.

　　After the Workers' Congress is over, a plan for implementing the resolutions and handling the proposals should be formulated immediately. The enterprise administration and the trade union organization incorporate the things they should do into their respective work plans according to the requirements of this plan, so that the implementation of the resolutions and proposals of the conference is unified with their own daily work. In addition, the trade union should also earnestly organize worker representatives to convey the resolutions of the Workers' Congress and inspect the implementation of the resolutions. The proposals put forward by the representatives should be carefully studied to ensure that each one is accounted for.

Trade Union Work After the Establishment of the Workers' Congress

　　Liu Shi also focused on the trade union work after the establishment of the Workers' Congress in the report. The report said that after the establishment of the Workers' Congress, the demands of the administration and workers on the trade union have also increased, and the work of the trade union is more arduous than in the past. The trade union must adapt to this new situation to improve its work. The main content of this aspect is:

　　(1) Improve the work style and organizational status of the trade union. That is, it is necessary to promote internal democracy in the trade union, and to give full play to the role of trade union organizations at all levels and various working committees, so that they can establish direct contact with relevant administrative departments and promptly discuss and solve problems. At the same time, it is also necessary to strengthen the work of workshops and groups.

　　(2) Appropriately combine the Workers' Congress with other forms of mass supervision, such as workshop workers' congresses, collective contracts, labor protection agreements, production meetings, etc., in order to more fully mobilize the masses, and make the work of mass participation in enterprise management and mass supervision of enterprises more comprehensive and in-depth. In particular, it is necessary to hold workshop workers' congresses well, because it is a direct component of the entire factory workers' congress.

　　(3) Give play to the role of worker representatives. Trade union organizations must maintain close contact with them, establish necessary contact systems, and help worker representatives improve their political level and activity ability, so that they can often contact the masses, understand and reflect the opinions and demands of the masses, accurately convey the resolutions of the conference, and take the lead in implementing the resolutions of the conference.

　　建立职工代表大会中的工会工作
    刘实在全国工会积极分子代表会议上的报告摘要
    新华社24日讯　在8月24日的全国工会积极分子代表会议上，中华全国总工会组织部长刘实向大会做了关于建立职工代表大会中的工会工作的报告。
    这个报告是根据前一时期在一些国营厂矿企业里建立职工代表大会试点工作时取得的工会工作经验，以及全总书记处在总结这些经验时所提的意见整理的。
    刘实说，自从中国共产党第八次全国代表大会提出进一步贯彻企业工作中的群众路线以来，在一些厂矿企业中进行了建立职工代表大会的试点工作。这些单位经过召开职工代表大会，扩大了企业内部民主，揭露和克服了企业内部的某些矛盾，改进了企业的领导工作，教育了干部和职工，加强了领导和群众之间的团结，推动了生产和各方面的工作。这些单位的初步成就证明，建立职工代表大会是运用群众路线办好企业的一项必要措施。
  工会在建立职工代表大会中的作用
    刘实接着谈到了企业内的工会在建立职工代表大会中应起的作用问题。他说，代表大会是党委领导下的群众监督的主要形式，建立职工代表大会的全部工作必须在党委的领导下来进行。同时应该充分地发挥工会组织的作用。经过试点工作的经验证明，由工会负责准备和召开职工代表大会，在大会休会期间负责检查大会决议的执行情况，有着很大的优越性。工会是工人阶级最广泛的群众性组织，在厂矿企业中百分之九十以上的职工是工会会员，能够反映职工群众的意见和要求。工会在企业里有从小组到全厂的完整的工作机构，这些工作机构在企业里开展了多方面的活动，并且积累了一定的工作经验。发挥工会组织的作用，运用工会干部和广大的工会积极分子，就能够把职工群众组织起来参加企业管理和对企业进行群众监督。
    刘实说第一批实行试点的一部分单位，是把职工代表大会同工会会员代表大会分建的，并且在职工代表大会上选出工厂管理委员会做为常设机构。经过几个月的试点工作，这种做法的缺点已经显露出来了。这就是：两种大会的内容很难区分，因此，会议重复，增加了干部和职工的负担；工厂管理委员会没有一套工作机构，“开会就有，散会就无”。它很难具体担负组织职工代表大会和监督大会决议实现的任务；出现了工厂管理委员会和工会委员会的关系问题，工会组织的作用被削弱了。正因为有以上这些缺点，不少采取这种做法的单位已经准备在下届职工代表大会上修改组织条例。
    报告着重指出：由工会来组织职工代表大会，并不会改变工会的性质，职工代表大会是职工参加企业管理和对企业行政进行群众监督的机构，它并不就是行政管理机构。在职工代表大会闭会期间，由工会委员会负责监督大会决议的执行，并不是去直接管理和组织生产。组织职工参加企业管理和对企业进行群众监督，正是在社会主义社会里，工人阶级的群众性组织——工会所必须具有的功能。事实上，通过组织职工代表大会，工会不仅反映了群众的情绪和要求，而且更有力地支持了群众的正确意见和合理要求，帮助群众在提高觉悟的基础上放弃了不正确的意见和不合理的要求，工会和群众的联系就更加紧密了。
    工会应该怎样对待同企业行政的关系
    刘实接着分析了工会应该怎样对待和企业行政的关系问题。他说，工会在组织职工代表大会中所碰到的根本问题，就是在国家利益同职工切身利益发生矛盾的情况下，在领导同群众发生矛盾的情况下，采取什么态度。工会组织的根本态度，应该是使国家利益也即是职工的整体利益同职工的切身利益得到合理的调整，在服从整体利益的前提下，尽一切可能关怀职工的切身利益，使领导和群众更加接近，使企业行政、工会、青年团在党的领导下更加团结起来。
    报告说，在社会主义企业内，企业的利益和职工群众的利益是一致的，企业行政和工会的根本任务和根本目的也是一致的。行政领导同职工群众之间的矛盾是在基本一致基础上的不一致，行政和工会的差别也是在基本一致基础上的差别。一致是根本的，不一致和差别是非根本的。所以，对于领导同群众的关系、工会同行政的关系上，要强调一致性，处理这种关系的方针是从团结的愿望出发，经过批评或斗争，在新的基础上达到新的团结。当然，这并不是否认还有不一致和差别的方面。职工代表大会，就是吸收职工群众和企业行政一道来讨论企业各项重大问题，开展批评和自我批评，使企业行政和职工群众的认识一致起来。报告说，人民内部有矛盾，揭露这种矛盾，正是为了克服这种矛盾，加强团结。批评或者斗争也正是为了加强团结。工会组织要这样认识和处理同企业行政的关系，也应该教育职工群众这样认识同企业行政的关系。
    报告说，工会所组织的群众监督和企业行政走群众路线是相吻合的。企业的主要任务是搞好生产和完成国家计划，这是企业领导者的要求，也是全体职工的要求，要做到这一点，必须有领导者和全体职工共同努力。目前，绝大多数的企业行政通过职工代表大会和其他形式，把国家建设事业和本企业的情况和困难向群众交代清楚，把需要解决的问题提到群众中去，这种做法增强了群众的主人翁责任感，并且引导职工群众从全局上来考虑问题。同时也使行政工作得到群众的全力支持。行政加强群众路线，工会积极地组织职工群众参加企业管理，这就使我们能够进一步做到领导依靠群众，群众支持领导，使领导和群众团结一致来办好企业，搞好生产。
    报告指出，工会在组织群众监督上，对企业行政是一种督促，但更重要的是积极的帮助。这就是，碰到问题的时候，首先要深入地进行调查研究，弄清楚这个问题所涉及的各种因素，发动群众找出解决问题的办法。然后，主动向行政反映情况，协商如何解决问题。协商中不仅要提出积极的建议，而且也要了解行政在工作中存在的困难，以便动员群众一起来克服困难。
  工会应该怎样对待群众的意见和要求
    报告说，在建立职工代表大会时，工会必须随时了解群众的情绪和要求。根据这些情绪、要求，开展宣传、教育工作，主动地改善自己的工作，并且帮助行政改善领导。这样，职工代表大会就能够健康地进行，收到良好效果。工会必须反映群众的情绪和要求，但这并不等于对这些意见和要求一律予以支持，工会必须分析群众的意见和要求，分别对待。
    对于群众的正确要求，也就是符合国家政策、法令，对生产有利或者不妨碍生产的，而且是有条件实现的要求，工会应该支持，使之实现。对于一时不易办到的和完全不合理的要求，工会组织应该把情况向群众讲清楚，组织职工展开讨论，引导职工从全局来考虑问题，在群众觉悟提高的基础上，使群众自觉地放弃这些要求。对群众提出的正确要求，实现时也必须有所分别。有些要求的实现，是需要国家出钱的，工会组织应该督促行政在国家拨款和企业本身可以使用的经费中解决这些问题。有些要求的实现，可以主要依靠群众自己的力量，或是完全可以依靠群众自己的力量来做到的，工会就应该多做一些组织工作。工会应该启发职工群众以勤俭建国、勤俭办事业的精神来解决问题。
    报告还说，解决实际问题应该和加强思想政治教育并重。我们面对的工人群众，是一支有觉悟、有组织的队伍。但是，职工群众由于工作岗位的局限性，在认识问题上也不可避免地会有一定的局限性，往往有些问题不能完全做到从全局来考虑。这就有必要向群众把情况摆清楚，把道理说明白，引导群众正确地对待这些问题。最近几年来，新工人的数量发展较快，这就更加要求我们加强政治思想工作。总之，工会在对待群众的要求上，不应该采取官僚主义的态度，——哄瞒欺骗、推诿敷衍、简单批判；同时，也不应该片面地强调代表群众，不顾及国家和企业的困难，不分析群众的意见，不敢向群众进行教育等。
      召开职工代表大会的组织工作
    刘实在谈到召开职工代表大会的组织工作时说，各试点单位组织工作都是分为准备、召开和贯彻三个阶段。在这三个阶段里，一般需要做以下一些工作：即在领导干部中统一思想，在职工中进行思想教育，选举代表，检查工作，准备报告，组织发言，起草决议，处理提案，实现大会的决议和提案等。
    刘实在报告中逐一交代了这些工作的具体做法，并且强调指出，所有这些工作，都是在企业党委的统一领导下进行的，工会必须紧紧依靠党委的领导，要协助企业行政主动地检查和总结工作，切实改进工作作风，并且做到充分发扬民主，使选出的代表具有广泛的群众性，在会上使大家能够畅所欲言。厂长的工作报告，大会的决议等，要事先将草稿交给职工代表讨论，同时工会应该积极地组织这个讨论，以便报告和决议都能充分反映群众要求，更加切合实际。
    在职工代表大会结束以后，应该立刻制订贯彻决议和处理提案的计划。企业行政和工会组织根据这个计划的要求，把自己应该做的事情列入各自的工作计划内，使实现大会的决议、提案和本身的日常工作统一起来。此外，工会还要认真组织职工代表传达职工代表大会决议和检查决议执行情况。对代表所提的提案，要认真加以研究，做到件件有交代。
    建立职工代表大会后的工会工作
    刘实在报告里还着重谈到了建立职工代表大会后的工会工作。报告说，建立职工代表大会后，行政和职工对工会的要求也提高了，工会的工作比过去繁重了，工会必须适应这种新情况来改进自己的工作。这方面的主要内容是：
    （一）改善工会的工作作风和组织状况。也就是要发扬工会内部民主，并且要充分发挥工会各级组织和各个工作委员会的作用，使他们能够和行政有关部门建立直接联系，及时商量解决问题。同时还要加强车间和小组的工作。
  （二）把职工代表大会和其他群众监督形式如车间职工大会、集体合同、劳动保护协议书、生产会议等，恰当地结合起来，以便更充分地发动群众，使群众参加企业管理和对企业实行监督的工作做得更全面、更深入。特别是要开好车间职工大会，因为它是全厂职工代表大会的一个直接的组成部分。
      （三）发挥职工代表的作用。工会组织必须同他们保持密切的联系，建立必要的联系制度，还应该帮助职工代表提高政治水平和活动能力，使他们能够做到经常联系群众，了解和反映群众的意见和要求，准确地传达大会决议和带头执行大会决议。
