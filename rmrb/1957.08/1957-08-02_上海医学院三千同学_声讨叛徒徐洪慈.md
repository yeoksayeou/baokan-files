Shanghai Medical College's Three Thousand Students
Denounce Traitor Xu Hongci

This newspaper reports that all the students of Shanghai First Medical College have been holding meetings in the sweltering heat for days, denouncing and exposing the anti-Party words and deeds of rightist Xu Hongci.

Xu Hongci is a third-year student in the Medical Department and was originally a Communist Party member. During the rectification movement, he colluded with some students who lacked clear understanding and posted the first big-character poster, putting forward fifty-one absurd demands, such as "Abolish the privileges of Party and League members," "General elections are undemocratic," "The suppression of counter-revolutionaries was wrong and needs to be redressed," and so on. When this big-character poster was criticized by the Party branch, he shouted: "The Party branch is isolating me!" When he was refuted by the students, he posted a so-called "admonition" big-character poster, scolding some students as "two-faced people." Then, he incited the students of classes eleven and twelve of the third grade of the Medical Department to hold two so-called "obstacle removal" seminars. He said to the students: "The Party Committee is hypocritical. It talks about airing views, but does not actually support it," inciting the students to hate the Party.

Xu Hongci's betrayal of the Party was supported by another rightist in the college, Fan Rixin, who publicly praised Xu as a "model Party member." Fan Rixin also said to Xu: "Don't be afraid, you must persevere, the bigger the commotion, the better; you are young, I am older than you and have more experience." He prepared to announce his withdrawal from the Communist Party and was preparing to incite the "most enthusiastic" Communist Youth League members to withdraw from the League, establish a separate political organization, defend the "fifty-one articles," and call on all students to continue airing views, sending delegations to various universities to give speeches, vainly attempting to further bring down the Party.

Xu Hongci's anti-Party remarks were refuted by all the students in the college. A small number of students who were temporarily deceived by him also woke up, made self-criticisms, and made revelations. More than three thousand students in the college expressed their determination to carry the anti-rightist struggle through to the end.

    上海医学院三千同学
    声讨叛徒徐洪慈
    本报讯　上海第一医学院全体同学，连日冒着酷暑集会，声讨和揭发右派分子徐洪慈的反党言行。
    徐洪慈是医疗系三年级学生，原来是共产党员。他在整风运动中，纠合一些认识不清的同学，贴出第一张大字报，提出了五十一条荒谬的主张，如“取消党团员特权”、
  “普选不民主”、“肃反肃错了，要平反”等等。当这张大字报受到党支部的批评时，他就大叫：“党支部孤立我！”当受到同学们的反驳时，他又贴出所谓“忠告”的大字报，谩骂某些同学是“两面派”。接着，他又煽动医疗系三年级十一、十二两班同学举行了两次所谓“扫除障碍”的座谈会。他对同学们说：“党委虚伪，口头上讲鸣放，实际上不支持。”煽动同学仇视党。
    徐洪慈的叛党行为，得到了该院另一右派分子范日新的支持，范日新当众称赞徐是“模范党员”。范日新又对徐说：“你不要怕，要坚持，事情闹得越大越好；你年轻，我年纪比你大，经验比你多。”他准备宣布退出共产党，并准备鼓动“最起劲的”共青团员退团，单独成立政治组织，保卫“五十一条”，号召全校同学继续大鸣大放，派代表团到各大学去演讲，妄想达到进一步搞垮党的目的。
    徐洪慈的反党言行，受到了全校同学的驳斥。一时被他蒙骗的少数同学，也清醒过来，作了检讨和揭发。全校三千多同学，表示要坚决把反右派斗争进行到底。
