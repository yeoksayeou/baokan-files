Socialist Education Changes Sluggish Production Situation
Guangdong's Late Rice Transplanting Speed Increases

(Our newspaper, Guangzhou, August 13th) Since Guangdong Province has universally carried out the socialist education movement, a new atmosphere has emerged in rural summer production, and the sluggish situation of late rice transplanting in the province has been reversed. In the main grain-producing areas of the province, such as the Chaoshan Plain and the Pearl River Delta, the transplanting progress has been accelerated by more than half, and sweet potatoes are also being planted in a rush. In the Huiyang Special District, which suffered severe flooding, the attendance rate of general agricultural cooperatives has increased from 60% before this ideological education movement to over 90%. In the past half month, the amount of accumulated fertilizer in the province has also increased from more than 300 million dan to more than 500 million dan. More than one million mu of low-yielding fields in the province have undergone soil improvement. Some drought-affected areas have launched a comprehensive anti-drought and rush-transplanting campaign. At present, they are striving to complete the transplanting task of 40 million mu of late rice in the province according to the season, at a rate of 2 million mu per day.

In recent days, landlords, rich peasants, and bad elements in the rural areas of Guangdong Province have rampantly carried out counter-settlement activities, provoked relations between the masses and cadres, and incited farmers to withdraw from the cooperatives. At that time, confused ideas also arose among the peasant masses, leading to stagnation in production work in some areas. After fully exposing the destructive activities of these landlords and rich peasants, the ideological understanding of the peasants was improved, and their production enthusiasm was greatly increased. For example, in Haikang County, 200,000 farmers in 15 townships enthusiastically participated in production after rebuffing 340 illegal landlords and rich peasants and punishing some criminal offenders. More than 600 cadres with a negative attitude became active in their work. One hundred and forty-eight households of farmers who had withdrawn from the cooperatives returned to the cooperatives. The atmosphere of unity among the farmers is now even stronger than before. At present, all localities have put forward the slogan of "no delay in both movement and production", organized a large number of cadres to go to the countryside to lead farmers in production, and strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest in late-season agriculture.

    社会主义教育改变生产疲沓局面
    广东晚稻插秧速度转快
    本报广州13日电　广东省普遍开展社会主义教育运动以来，农村的夏季生产出现了新的气象，全省晚稻插秧疲沓的局面已经扭转过来。省内主要粮食产区潮汕平原和珠江三角洲等地，插秧进度加快一半以上，并在抢种番薯。曾经遭受严重水灾的惠阳专区，一般农业社的出勤率，由这次思想教育运动以前的60％提高到90％以上。半个月来，全省积肥的数量也由三亿多担，增加到五亿多担。全省有一百多万亩低产田实行了土壤改良。部分受旱地区全面掀起了抗旱抢插运动。目前，每天正以插秧两百万亩的速度，争取按季节完成全省四千万亩晚稻插秧任务。
    前些日子，广东省农村中的不法地主、富农和坏分子猖狂进行反攻倒算活动，并挑拨群众和干部的关系，煽动农民退社。当时农民群众中也产生了混乱思想，以致有些地区的生产工作停滞不前。经过充分揭发了这些地主、富农的破坏活动以后，农民的思想认识提高了，生产热情高涨。例如海康县十五个乡二十多万农民，在反击三百四十个不法地主、富农和惩办了一些刑事犯罪分子之后，热情参加生产。六百多个态度消极的干部工作积极起来了。一百四十八户退社的农民，重新回到社里。农民之间的团结气氛比从前更加浓厚。目前，各地提出了“运动和生产两不误”的口号，组织大批干部下乡领导农民生产，力争晚造农业全面丰收。
