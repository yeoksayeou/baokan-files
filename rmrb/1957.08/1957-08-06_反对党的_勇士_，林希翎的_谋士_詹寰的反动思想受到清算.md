The "Warrior" of the Anti-Party Clique, Lin Xiling's "Strategist": Zhan Huan's Reactionary Thought Undergoes Cleansing

(Reported by this newspaper) According to the *China Youth Daily*, all staff members of the *China Youth Daily* have been waging a resolute struggle against Zhan Huan, a reporter and rightist element of the newspaper, for days. They exposed a large number of Zhan Huan's reactionary words and deeds, and uncovered his sinister activities as Lin Xiling's "strategist."

This Zhan Huan, who had participated in the Three People's Principles Youth League, entered the liberated areas in 1948 with base personal aims. Because his individualistic goals were not achieved, he has been dissatisfied with the Party. Especially since 1952, his reactionary words and deeds have become more vicious and sinister. He said, "Neither the Soviet Union nor China are typical socialist societies," and vigorously promoted revisionist ideas. At the end of last year, he even slandered the Soviet Union for "military intervention" in Hungary, and he advocated "fundamentally changing Hungary from a social system perspective." He negated all major measures of the Party and the government. He once said that the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea was "not in accordance with international law."

This spring, after the Party Central Committee proposed rectification, he launched conspiratorial activities using double-dealing tactics. He remained silent within the newspaper, proclaiming that he was not interested in rectification, contemptuously saying, "After rectification, isn't it still those people in power?" Secretly, however, he claimed that "the era of man has begun." He traveled day and night, setting fires everywhere.

He used all his energy to support Lin Xiling. Zhan Huan and Lin Xiling met in Xi'an in August last year, and they hit it off immediately, sharing the same vile sentiments. In a letter to Lin Xiling on September 26 last year, he wrote: "Our era needs warriors too much, it needs trailblazers too much, it needs independent-minded people too much. Look around us, isn't it still full of yes-men, parrots, weathercocks, and flatterers who suppress those below them...? This phenomenon will be eliminated sooner or later, and we also have a responsibility to promote its elimination and death." Zhan Huan also repeatedly stole internal materials and internal publications from the newspaper for Lin Xiling to see. When Lin Xiling delivered a reactionary speech at Peking University, he was busy providing materials and offering ideas. At the same time, he repeatedly suggested that the newspaper should report on the situation of the rightist elements at Peking University attacking the Party, and even attempted to make the rightist element Liu Binyan the editor-in-chief of the newspaper.

When students at Peking University prepared to counterattack Lin Xiling, he automatically acted as an intelligence officer, sneaking into Peking University to gather information and secretly plotting countermeasures with Lin Xiling. He also initiated fundraising, spent money to buy paper, provided Lin Xiling with the means to print and distribute reactionary remarks, and helped Lin Xiling establish contact with Wu Kaibin, a rightist element at Wuhan University.

After the anti-rightist struggle began, the cunning and sinister Zhan Huan escaped from the newspaper under the pretext of conducting interviews. He secretly slipped to Suzhou, Shanghai, Hangzhou and other places, considering ways to "cope with the situation." After the newspaper transferred him back, he sometimes pretended to confess, sometimes pretended to be confused, and did not make a serious self-criticism or confession.

### 反对党的“勇士”，林希翎的“谋士”  詹寰的反动思想受到清算

    反对党的“勇士”，林希翎的“谋士”
    詹寰的反动思想受到清算
    本报讯　中国青年报消息：中国青年报全体工作人员，连日对该报记者、右派分子詹寰进行坚决斗争。他们揭发了詹寰大批的反动言行，并拆穿他充当林希翎“谋士”的阴险活动。
    这个曾参加过三青团的詹寰，是在1948年怀着卑鄙的个人目的进入解放区的。由于他的个人主义目的未能达到，一直对党不满。特别从1952年以来，他的反动言行更加恶毒阴险。他说：“苏联和中国都不是典型的社会主义社会”，极力宣传修正主义思想。去年年底，他更污蔑苏联“出兵干涉”了匈牙利，他主张“从社会制度上根本改变匈牙利”。对党和政府的重大措施，他一概否定。他曾说抗美援朝运动“不合国际法”。
    今年春天，党中央提出整风后，他以两面派手法展开阴谋活动。他在报社内不动声色，宣扬对整风不感兴趣，轻蔑地说：“整风，整完了还不是那些人当权。”暗地里却声称“人的时代开始了”。日夜奔走，到处点火。
    他用全部心血支援林希翎。詹寰和林希翎去年8月在西安一晤，就臭味相投，一拍即合。去年9月26日，他给林希翎的信中写道：“我们这个时代太需要勇士，太需要闯将，太需要独立特行的人物。看看吧，在我们周围，不是还充斥着唯唯诺诺，人云亦云，见风使舵，谄上压下之辈吗……，这种现象迟早会被消灭的，我们也有责任促使它消灭死亡。”詹寰还多次把报社内部材料和内部刊物偷出去给林希翎看。林希翎在北京大学发表反动演说时，他忙着去提供材料出主意。与此同时，他一再建议报纸应该报道北大右派分子向党进攻的情况，还企图让右派分子刘宾雁作报社的总编辑。
    当北京大学学生准备反击林希翎时，他又自动担任情报员混到北大刺探消息，与林希翎密谋对策。他还发起募捐，出钱买纸，供林希翎印发反动言论，并帮助林希翎和武汉大学右派分子吴开斌建立联系。
    反右派斗争开始后，狡猾阴险的詹寰，在采访的借口下逃出报社。偷偷溜往苏州、上海、杭州一带，考虑“应变”的办法。报社把他调回来后，他有时假装认罪，有时假装糊涂，并没有作认真地检查和交代。
