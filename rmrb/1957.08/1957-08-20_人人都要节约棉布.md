According to the report submitted by the Ministry of Commerce to the State Council regarding the cotton cloth supply issue, due to the limitations of the cotton textile industry caused by insufficient cotton, the original production plan cannot be completed. In the fourth year of implementing planned cotton cloth supply, the average cotton cloth quota supplied by the state to the people nationwide is generally 16 chi per person, a decrease of more than 4 chi compared to the previous year's 20.65 chi. If this year's cotton harvest is abundant, the average supply quota per person may reach 18 chi, a decrease of more than 2 chi compared to the previous year.

From today's perspective, a decrease of 2 chi of cloth per person may seem like a problem; in reality, this is much better than the situation before liberation. Calculated on a per capita basis nationwide, in 1949, the average person only had slightly more than 7 chi of civilian cloth, while in the fourth year of the 1957-1958 cotton cloth planned supply, there would be 16 to 18 chi, an increase of more than double. The ragged appearance of the Chinese people, unable to cover their bodies, has fundamentally changed today, and most families have made many new clothes and new bedding. Since liberation, the national cotton cloth consumption has continuously increased. Although this year's cotton cloth supply quantity has decreased compared to the previous two years, it is basically not lower than the supply level of previous years before 1955.

Although the decrease in the quantity of cotton cloth supply inevitably causes some difficulties in people's lives, these difficulties in progress can be overcome as long as our people pay attention to conservation. Everyone knows that our country has very little arable land per capita. To ensure the need for food, we cannot excessively expand the cotton planting area. To ensure the country's socialist industrialization, it is also impossible to use a large amount of foreign exchange to import cotton to increase cotton cloth supply. The construction of a large-scale man-made fiber industry also requires considerable time. Therefore, the situation that cotton cloth cannot fully meet the needs of the people will be a long-term problem in our country. During this period, in addition to the state's efforts to develop production and adhere to the policy of planned purchase and planned supply of cotton and cotton cloth, the people must use various methods to save cloth.

About eight-tenths of the cotton cloth produced by the state is used for civilian supply. Therefore, saving everyone's cloth usage is the most important way to save cotton cloth. Our country has a population of over 600 million. As long as each person uses one chi more cloth per year, the whole country will consume more than 6 million bolts of cloth per year. Conversely, if everyone uses one chi less cloth each year, the country can save more than 6 million bolts of cloth. Think about it, what a huge number this is!

Among the reduced supply quantities, the supply quotas for urban residents (including workers, cadres, and students) have been reduced more. Will they encounter too many difficulties? Everyone knows that urban residents' cotton cloth consumption has always been higher than that of rural areas. Since the implementation of planned supply, the supply quota for urban residents has also been higher than that of rural areas. Many of them have clothes "at the bottom of the trunk." These clothes should be fully utilized: restyle outdated styles, re-dye faded clothes, repair unsuitable sizes, give clothes that adults cannot wear to children, and give clothes that older children cannot wear to younger children.

In rural areas, although the quota is slightly less than in large cities, it has not decreased much compared to last year, and the impact is not very large. However, considering that the income of most farmers has increased in recent years, and the need for cloth is also growing, Party and government leading organs and rural staff at all levels should widely explain to the peasant masses that this year, due to the reduction of cotton planting area, it is necessary to reduce the supply of cotton cloth, calling on everyone to overcome difficulties in order to strive for the country to achieve socialist industrialization as soon as possible and become prosperous and strong as soon as possible, at which time the difficult days can be fundamentally ended. As long as this principle is well explained, the peasant masses can understand it.

The potential for saving cotton cloth is great. For example, statistics from more than 130 tailoring cooperatives in Beijing show that more than 40,000 pieces of old clothes were altered in the first half of this year, saving the country more than 270,000 chi of cotton cloth, and consumers also saved tens of thousands of yuan in expenses. If the whole country does this, it will save a considerable amount. For example, many places have achieved great success in promoting measuring and selling cloth at the retail level. Consumers buying cloth and salespeople selling cloth generally have a common habit: rather have more than less. If salespeople persuade consumers to buy cloth appropriately based on their body size when selling cloth, a lot of cloth can be saved. Saving three or two cun of cloth per garment is a large number on a national scale. After Tianjin implemented the method of measuring and selling cloth, it is estimated that the city can save 500,000 chi of cloth for the country within a year.

The tailoring industry in many places has also come up with many ways to save cloth by improving cutting and layout. In Beijing's tailoring industry, in the process of processing clothing in batches, just by improving cutting, clothing production cooperatives and joint state-private clothing factories can save at least 6,000 bolts of cloth this year, enough to make 80,000 new clothes.

From the consumer's point of view, in addition to promoting the modification of old clothes, we should also actively promote cloth-saving clothing styles. In the past, urban women mostly wore cheongsams. Making a cheongsam can save at least half the cloth compared to making a set of cadre uniforms. Chinese-style jackets, for both men and women, save more cloth than cadre uniforms. Therefore, it should be advocated that in the future, when adding new clothes, add more of these cloth-saving styles of clothing, and try to tailor them to fit, and do not waste them. In this regard, we especially hope that female staff members of organizations and groups and women workers in various places will promote this. As long as we can make efforts to save in all aspects, this year's cotton cloth supply, although reduced somewhat, is still sufficient.

In order to save cotton cloth nationwide, we must correct some one-sided and incorrect ideas. Last year, for a period of time, the style of clothing was excessively emphasized in newspapers and periodicals, which caused many side effects. Although it is appropriate to pay attention to the style of clothing, we should never advocate wasteful and extravagant bad habits. When the national cotton cloth supply is insufficient, everyone should consciously wear old clothes of various styles to save cloth for the country and help the country overcome difficulties. For the sake of socialism, we must create a new atmosphere of hard work, plain living and thrift nationwide. If some people want to use this atmosphere of saving to make distorted propaganda, saying that we have some insurmountable difficulties, let them dream on. We will certainly be able to overcome all difficulties and build our country into a prosperous and strong socialist industrial country.

### 人人都要节约棉布

    人人都要节约棉布
    根据商业部关于棉布供应问题向国务院提出的报告，由于棉纺织业受到棉花不足的限制，不能完成原定的生产计划，在实行棉布计划供应的第四个年度内，国家供应给全国人民每人的平均棉布定量，一般为十六尺，比上一年度的二十点六五尺减少四尺多。如果今年棉花丰收，每人平均供应定量也有可能达到十八尺，比上年度减少二尺多。
    从现在的眼光看来，每人减少二尺布似乎是一个问题；其实，这比起解放前的情况还是好多了。按全国人口平均计算，1949年每人平均只有民用布七尺多，而1957年至1958年棉布计划供应的第四年度则有十六尺至十八尺，增加了一倍多。旧中国人民衣不蔽体的褴褛现象今天已经基本上改观了，大部分人家都添制了不少的新衣服、新被褥。解放以来全国人民的棉布消费量不断增长。今年的棉布供应数量虽然比前两年减少了，但是同1955年以前各年度的供应水平相比，基本上没有降低。
    棉布供应数量的减少，虽然不能不使人民在生活上感到一些困难，但是，只要我国人民注意节约，这种前进中的困难是可以克服的。谁都知道，我们国家按人口平均耕地面积很少。为了保证粮食的需要，就不能过多地扩大棉花种植面积。为了保证国家的社会主义工业化，也不可能使用大量外汇进口棉花来增加棉布供应。而建设大规模的人造纤维工业，也需要相当的时间。因此，棉布不能充分满足人民需要的状况，在我国将是一个较长时期的问题。在这段时期内，除了国家要努力发展生产，并且坚持贯彻对棉花和棉布的计划收购、计划供应的政策以外，人民群众必须用各种方法节约用布。
    国家生产的棉布，约有十分之八左右是用来供应民用的。因此，节约每一个人的用布就是节约棉布的最主要办法。我国人口有六亿多，只要全国每一个人一年多用一尺布，一年就要多消费六百多万匹布。反过来，如果每人每年都少用一尺布，国家也就可以节省六百多万匹布。想想看，这是一个多大的数字！
    在减少供应的数量中，城市居民（包括职工、干部和学生）的供应定量减得比较多。他们会不会遇到太多的困难呢？大家知道，城市居民的棉布消费从来就比农村多，实行计划供应以来，城市居民的供应定量也一直比农村为高，他们当中有不少人都有“压箱底”的衣服。这些衣服应该充分地利用起来：样式过时的翻改一下，脱色的衣服加染一下，尺码不合适的修理一下，大人不能穿的改给孩子穿，大孩子不能穿的改给小孩子穿。
    在农村方面，定量虽然比大城市稍为少一点，但是和去年相比却减少不多，影响并不很大。但是，估计到几年来一般农民收入比以前都有了增加，用布的需要也在增长，所以各地党政领导机关和农村工作人员应该广泛地向农民群众说明，今年因为棉花种植面积减少，不得不减少棉布的供应，号召大家克服困难，以便争取国家早日实现社会主义工业化，早日富强起来，那时候困难的日子就可以从根本上结束了。只要好好解释这种道理，农民群众是可以想通的。
    节约棉布的潜在力量很大。例如，北京市一百三十多个缝纫社统计，今年上半年翻改了四万多件旧衣服，就给国家节省了二十七万多尺棉布，消费者也节省了数十万元开支。如果全国都这样干，那就会节约出一个很可观的数目。再如，很多地方在零售环节上推行量体售布，也取得了很大成绩。消费者买布和营业员卖布，一般都有一个共同的习惯，就是宁可多一点，不要少了。如果营业员在卖布的时候，根据消费者的身材说服消费者恰当地买布，这就可以少用很多的布。一件衣服少费三、二寸，从全国范围来说就是很大的数目。天津市推行量体售布办法以后，预计全市在一年之内就可以为国家节省五十万尺布。
    不少地方的缝纫行业，也从改进剪裁排料方面想出了很多节约用布的办法。北京市缝纫业在成批服装加工的过程中，只是改进裁剪一项，服装生产合作社和公私合营服装厂今年一年就至少可以节省六千匹布，够作八万件新衣。
    在消费者方面来说，除了提倡旧衣改制以外，还应该积极推广省布的服装样式。过去城市妇女多半穿旗袍，做一件旗袍比做一套干部服至少可以省一半布。中式褂子，无论男女，都比干部服要省布。所以应该提倡今后在添制衣服的时候，多添制这些省布的式样的服装，并且尽可能量体裁衣，不要浪费。在这一方面，我们特别希望机关团体的女工作人员和各地妇女工作者加以倡导。只要我们能够从各方面努力节约，今年的棉布供应量虽然减少了一些，还是可以够用的。
    为了在全国范围内节约棉布，必须纠正一些片面的不正确的思想。去年有一个时期，在报刊上曾经过分地强调了服装的式样，发生了许多副作用。虽然适当地注意服装的式样是可以的；但是决不应当提倡浪费和奢侈的不良作风。在国家棉布供应不足的时候，大家应该自觉地穿各种式样的旧衣，为国家省布，帮助国家克服困难。为了社会主义，我们必须在全国范围内普遍地造成一种新的风气，就是艰苦朴素和勤劳节俭的风气。假如有一些人想利用这种节约的风气来作歪曲的宣传，说我们有了什么不可克服的困难，那就让他们白日做梦去吧。我们一定能够克服一切困难，把自己的国家建设成为富强的社会主义工业国家。
