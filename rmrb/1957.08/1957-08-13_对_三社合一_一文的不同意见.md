    Dissenting Opinions on the Article "Three Cooperatives Combined into One"
    Li Ren
    The lack of coordination between rural commerce, finance, and agricultural production currently exists in some areas. The article "Three Cooperatives Combined into One" states: "Agricultural cooperatives are under the leadership of rural Party and government grassroots organizations, while supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives are under the leadership of higher-level supply and marketing cooperatives and the People's Bank. Rural Party and government grassroots organizations cannot organize credit cooperatives and supply and marketing cooperatives to serve agricultural production well..." It also mentions that "Supply and marketing cooperatives conduct supply and marketing business according to the requirements of higher-level cooperatives, which often fails to meet local needs..." I believe this statement is not entirely appropriate. Because rural Party and government organizations are not unable to organize supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives to serve agricultural production well. Although supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives are subject to the vertical leadership of their higher-level departments, they cannot be separated from the leadership of local Party and government organizations. Is it true that supply and marketing cooperatives often cannot meet local needs when conducting business activities according to the requirements of higher-level cooperatives? Generally speaking, the requirements of higher-level cooperatives are basically in line with objective requirements. It's just that sometimes the supply of certain materials cannot meet the needs of the masses, but this is not entirely caused by following the requirements of higher-level cooperatives. Of course, in order to solve the problem of incoordination between the "three cooperatives," the issue of leadership relations cannot be ignored. I think the main thing should be to solve the problem of how supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives can actively obtain the leadership of rural Party and government organizations and closely connect with agricultural cooperatives. On the other hand, it should also solve the problem of rural Party and government organizations strengthening their leadership over supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives.
    I think it is necessary for the "three cooperatives" to each have their own organization, meeting system, and leading cadres. Because each has its own responsibilities. Supply and marketing cooperatives are to support agricultural production through purchasing and sales business. The purchasing and sales business itself is very complex, and without a specialized organization and leading cadres, it cannot meet the requirements of the work. The central task of the agricultural cooperative's director or deputy director is to do a good job in agricultural production. If they concurrently serve as the director (or head) of the supply and marketing cooperative and the credit cooperative, they will inevitably be unable to attend to all matters.
    My opinion is that the "three cooperatives" should not emphasize unification. At present, we should give full play to the leading role of rural Party and government organizations, so that the "three cooperatives" can cooperate with each other under the leadership of local Party and government organizations.
      If the "three cooperatives" are not unified, can the supply and marketing cooperative grasp the needs of the masses for means of production and means of livelihood, and improve the supply and marketing work accordingly to facilitate the masses' purchases and solve the problem of farmers not having time to go to the market during the busy farming season? I think it can be solved, because the key lies in whether the supply and marketing cooperative's investigation and research work is thorough. Facilitating mass purchases and saving labor days for the masses is not a unique advantage of the "three cooperatives" being combined into one. In the past and present, many regions have carried out "backpacking down to the countryside, delivering goods to the door," and "collecting native waste products door-to-door," which facilitated mass purchases and sales and also expanded purchasing and sales business.
      The "three cooperatives" can only be combined into one if there is only one agricultural cooperative, supply and marketing cooperative, and credit cooperative in a township. At present, the size of townships varies, and the conditions and situations of agricultural cooperatives are different, while the arrangement of supply and marketing cooperatives must take into account both the convenience of mass purchases and sales and economic accounting. In a considerable number of counties in Liaoning Province, there are several agricultural cooperatives in one township, while most supply and marketing cooperatives serve multiple townships, and credit cooperatives also mostly serve one township. How can the "three cooperatives" be "combined into one"?

### 对“三社合一”一文的不同意见

    对“三社合一”一文的不同意见
    李仁
    农村商业、金融、农业生产不协调的现象，目前在某些地区是存在的。“三社合一”这篇文章中说：“农业社归乡村党政基层组织领导，供销社和信用社归上级供销社和人民银行领导，农村党政基层组织无法组织信用社和供销社很好地为农业生产服务……”又提到“供销社按照上级社的要求进行供销业务，往往不能符合当地需求……”。我认为这种提法不完全妥当。因为农村党政组织并不是无法组织供销社、信用社很好为农业生产服务的。供销社、信用社虽然受其上级部门垂直领导，但是也不能脱离当地党政组织的领导。供销社按照上级社要求进行业务活动，是不是往往不能符合当地需求呢？一般来讲上级社要求还是基本符合客观要求的。只不过是有时某些物资供应满足不了群众需要，但这也不完全是因为按照上级社要求办事而造成的。当然，为了解决“三社”之间不协调现象也不能不考虑领导关系问题。我觉得主要的应该是解决供销社和信用社如何主动的取得乡村党政组织的领导和与农业社密切联系问题，另一方面也应该解决农村党政组织加强对供销社和信用社的领导问题。
    “三社”各有一套组织、会议制度和领导干部，我认为这是需要的。因为各有各的职责。供销社是要通过购销业务支持农业生产，供销业务本身很复杂，没有专门的组织机构和领导干部，是不能适应工作要求的。农业社社长或副社长的中心任务是搞好农业生产，他们兼任供销社、信用社的社长（或主任），势必会顾此失彼。
    我的意见是“三社”不要强调合一，目前应该是充分发挥农村党政组织的领导作用，使“三社”统一在当地党政组织领导下分工合作。
      “三社”不合一，供销社能不能掌握群众对生产资料、生活资料的需要情况，并据此改进供销工作便利群众购买，解决农忙无暇赶集等问题呢？我认为是可以解决的，因为关键在于供销社的调查研究工作是否深入。便利群众购买，群众节省工日，这不是“三社”合一独有的好处，很多地区供销社过去和现在都搞过“背包下乡、送货到门”、“挨门逐户收购土废品”，便利了群众购销，同时也扩大了购销业务。
      “三社”合一，必须是一个乡只有一个农业社、供销社、信用社才成。目前乡的大小不同，农业社的情况和条件不一，而供销社的摆布既要考虑群众购销方便，又要考虑经济核算。辽宁省相当数量的县是一乡好几个农业社，供销社则绝大部分是一社多乡，信用社也多是一乡一社。“三社”怎么“合一”呢？
