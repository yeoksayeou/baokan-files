Xinhua News Agency, August 18th dispatch from Bangkok: According to Thai newspapers, Thai Foreign Minister Narathip said that Thailand can decide to recognize China on its own and does not need to follow the United States. He said, "We have always maintained that when China enters the United Nations, we should consider recognizing it." Thailand's principle is "to abide by the purposes of the United Nations."

Narathip made these remarks in response to reporters' questions regarding the recent incident in which the Chiang Kai-shek clique's "embassy" in Thailand forced overseas Chinese to participate in activities opposing China's entry into the United Nations. He believes that the Chiang Kai-shek clique has no right to force overseas Chinese in Thailand to participate in political activities. He hopes that overseas Chinese will not interfere in politics and should cooperate with the local government.

    蒋介石集团无权强迫华侨反对祖国
    据新华社18日讯　曼谷消息：据泰国报纸报道，泰国外交部长那拉底说，泰国可以自己决定承认中国而不需要跟着美国走。他说，“我们一向主张，在中国进入联合国的时候，我们便要考虑予以承认。”泰国的原则是“遵守联合国的宗旨”。
    那拉底是就最近蒋介石集团驻泰“大使馆”强迫华侨参加反对中国进入联合国的活动的事件，答复记者询问时说这番话的。他认为蒋介石集团无权在泰国强迫华侨参加政治活动。他希望华侨不要干预政治而应该同当地政府合作。
