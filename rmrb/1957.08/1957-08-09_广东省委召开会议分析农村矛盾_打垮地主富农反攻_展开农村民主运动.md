Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 8th: The Guangdong Provincial Party Committee recently concluded a meeting of district party committee and municipal/prefectural party committee secretaries, where they studied the situation of the socialist propaganda movement in the province and determined future tasks.

Currently, the broad masses of peasants in Guangdong Province have launched a movement to counter the illegal activities of landlords and rich peasants. However, some party members and state cadres, especially some party members and cadres in the political and legal departments, have shown serious right-leaning tendencies and have not resolutely supported this just action by the peasants. The meeting demanded that the right-leaning ideas of these cadres be immediately corrected, and that party members and state cadres be further organized to resolutely lead this movement.

The meeting analyzed that the vast majority of peasants have three main contradictions: first, contradictions with the destructive activities of illegal landlords and rich peasants; second, contradictions with the capitalist tendencies of well-to-do middle peasants; and third, contradictions between individual peasants and the state and the collective of cooperatives. The third type is a contradiction among the people. Although it is not currently tense, it will always exist and occur frequently during the socialist period, and therefore should be regarded as the basic contradiction in the countryside in our work. The second contradiction is also a contradiction among the people, and it is very important for a considerable period of time, and is sometimes acute. The first contradiction is entirely a contradiction between ourselves and the enemy. It is currently very prominent because the class boundaries are clear, and cadres have experience in handling such contradictions, making it relatively easy to resolve. Therefore, from a long-term and fundamental perspective, the main force should be put into resolving the third and second types of contradictions, especially the third type; we cannot slightly neglect the latter two types of contradictions because we need to prominently resolve the first type of contradiction currently. The meeting estimated that defeating the illegal activities of landlords and rich peasants can only create better conditions for resolving the contradictions between peasants and the state and cooperatives, and the contradictions between the broad masses of peasants and the capitalist tendencies of well-to-do middle peasants, but it cannot resolve these two contradictions.

The meeting decided that in this socialist propaganda movement, it is necessary to closely combine countering the illegal activities of landlords and rich peasants; criticizing capitalist tendencies in the countryside; and promoting democracy, correcting shortcomings, and effectively running cooperatives, and none of them should be neglected. In terms of leadership and arrangement, it is necessary to organize a democratic movement within the peasantry after thoroughly defeating the counterattacks and settling accounts of the illegal landlords and rich peasants, allowing the peasants to express all their opinions and doubts, and then organize a large debate to distinguish between right and wrong. The Party, government, and cooperatives should sincerely accept and effectively resolve those beneficial criticisms; after debate, criticisms and explanations should be given for those incorrect opinions and understandings of the peasants to improve their political awareness.

Capitalist tendencies in the countryside should be criticized in the struggle against landlords and rich peasants; they should be further criticized in promoting democracy, organizing large debates, raising awareness, and improving work. Poor and lower-middle peasants will also be educated through criticism and self-criticism in this criticism.

The meeting also emphasized following the mass line. For example, to carry out socialist education and criticize capitalist tendencies, we should first mobilize the masses to put forward their views. It is estimated that these views are generally about: views on the unified purchase and sale of grain and the superiority of cooperatives, the relationship between public and private interests, the relationship between urban and rural areas, democracy and centralism, freedom and discipline, dictatorship and law-abiding, and democracy, etc. After these issues are concentrated, they should be taken to the masses for a large debate. Cadres should also conduct education based on national policies in response to these issues. Other things such as democratic management of cooperatives and cracking down on illegal landlords and rich peasants should also adopt this method.

The meeting requested cadres and party members at all levels to fully trust the poor and lower-middle peasants and believe in the majority of the masses. It also required leading cadres to go to the countryside, especially requiring the first secretary of the prefectural committee to go deep into one or two townships to create typical experiences and promote the general situation.

### 广东省委召开会议分析农村矛盾  打垮地主富农反攻　展开农村民主运动

    广东省委召开会议分析农村矛盾
    打垮地主富农反攻　展开农村民主运动
    新华社广州8日电　广东省前几天结束的区党委、地市委书记会议，研究了全省社会主义宣传运动形势，并决定了今后任务。
    现在，广东省广大农民群众已展开了反击不法地主富农的运动。但是部分党员和国家干部，尤其是政法部门的一些党员和干部，却表现有严重的右倾思想，没有坚决地支持农民这种正义行动。会议要求立刻纠正这部分干部的右倾思想，进一步组织党员和国家干部坚决领导这个运动。
    会议分析，现在绝大多数农民和各方面有三个主要矛盾：第一是和不法地主富农的破坏活动有矛盾；第二是和富裕中农的资本主义倾向有矛盾；第三是农民个人和国家、合作社的集体有矛盾。第三种是人民内部矛盾，当前虽不紧张，但在社会主义时期内却是永远存在和经常发生的，因而在我们工作中应该当作农村中的基本矛盾。第二种矛盾也是人民内部矛盾，在相当长的时期内都是很重要的，有时是尖锐的。第一种矛盾完全是敌我矛盾，当前很突出，因为阶级界限显明，干部处理这类矛盾有经验，比较容易解决。因此，从长期和根本问题上设想，应该把主要力量放到解决第三种和第二种矛盾，特别是第三种矛盾上；不能因为当前要突出地解决第一种矛盾，而稍稍忽略了后两种矛盾。会议估计，打垮了地主富农的不法活动，只能为解决农民和国家、合作社的矛盾，广大农民同富裕中农资本主义倾向的矛盾创造更好的条件，但决不能解决这两个矛盾。
    会议决定在此次社会主义宣传运动中，必须把反击地主富农不法活动；批判农村中的资本主义倾向；发扬民主，改正缺点，切实办好合作社三者密切结合起来，不能偏废。领导安排上，就需要在彻底打垮不法地主富农的反攻倒算后，在农民内部组织一个民主运动，让农民把自己所有的意见和疑问，统通说了出来，然后组织大辩论，分清是非。对于那些有益的批评意见，党、政府和合作社都应该诚恳接受，切实解决；对于农民那些不正确的意见和认识，经过辩论，给予批判和解释，将农民的政治觉悟提高。
    农村中的资本主义倾向，在反击地主富农斗争中，要给以批判；在发扬民主，组织大辩论，提高觉悟，改进工作中，要进一步给以批判。贫农和下中农在这种批判中也将通过批评和自我批评受到教育。
    会议还强调了走群众路线。如进行社会主义教育，批判资本主义倾向，应该先发动群众把自己的看法提出来。估计这些看法大体上是：对粮食统购统销和合作社优越性的看法、公和私的关系、城乡关系、民主和集中、自由和纪律、专政守法和民主等等。这些问题集中后，拿到群众中去大辩论。干部也要针对这些问题根据国家政策去进行教育。其它如民主办社，打击不法地主富农也都应该采用这个办法。
    会议要求各级干部和党员，充分相信贫农和下中农，相信大多数群众。还要求领导干部下乡，特别要求地委第一书记能深入一两个乡创造典型经验，推动一般。
