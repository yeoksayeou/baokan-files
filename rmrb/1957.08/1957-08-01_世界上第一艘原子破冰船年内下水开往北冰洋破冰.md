World's First Atomic Icebreaker

To be Launched This Year and Head to the Arctic to Break Ice

How is the construction of the world's first atomic icebreaker progressing? Is it almost finished? This is something many people are interested in. Now, please take a look at this photo, and you can see that it is almost completed. The workers at the Leningrad Shipyard in the Soviet Union, where the ship is being built, have decided to launch it this year and have given it the name "Lenin."

The "Lenin" icebreaker not only ranks first in the world in terms of having an atomic engine, but it is also the largest icebreaker in the world. Its power is twice that of the latest American "Glacier" icebreaker, which is currently considered the most powerful icebreaker. The "Glacier" has a power of 22,000 horsepower, while the atomic icebreaker has a power of 44,000 horsepower. The "Lenin" atomic icebreaker is 134 meters long, 27.6 meters wide at its widest point, has a displacement of 16,000 tons, and a speed of 18 knots in clear water.

Why did Soviet shipbuilders choose an icebreaker instead of a merchant ship or passenger ship when building the world's first civilian ship with an atomic engine? This is because in the Arctic region, fuel is a primary concern. An icebreaker with an atomic engine can operate for more than twelve months without refueling! The nuclear fuel it carries can take it around the Earth three times along the equator. Therefore, there is no need to worry about fuel issues. An icebreaker using coal as fuel can only operate for twenty days and nights without replenishment; an icebreaker using oil as fuel (diesel-electric icebreaker) can only operate for forty days and nights without replenishment. Furthermore, an icebreaker using oil as fuel burns 70 tons of fuel per day and night, while an atomic icebreaker only needs 45 cubic centimeters of nuclear fuel per day and night, and this amount of fuel can fit in a matchbox.

The hull of the "Lenin" atomic icebreaker is not built with a single rivet but is welded with special steel. The huge bow stem, weighing twenty-six tons, has been welded. The assembly of various parts of the ship has been completed. Currently, the foundation for the turbo generator and other machinery is being built. The power of the atomic reactor is equivalent to the power of a power station that can supply a city of 500,000 residents.

How is nuclear fuel used to power the icebreaker? The atomic "flame" in the atomic reactor heats water circulating under high pressure. This water is dangerously radioactive. The water transfers its heat to another water circuit in a heat exchanger (this water circuit is isolated from the nuclear reaction process and is not dangerous to humans). The steam enters the turbo generator, and the generator sends electricity to the ship's engine.

All processes on the atomic ship—from the operation of the reactor to the opening of the sea route—are controlled by electronic automatic regulators. The operator only needs to give commands to the automatic regulator and receive information about the operation process from it. In fact, the entire atomic ship is an extremely complex technical structure, a machine that conforms to the latest technology of the atomic and electronic age.

### 世界上第一艘原子破冰船年内下水开往北冰洋破冰

    世界上第一艘原子破冰船
    年内下水开往北冰洋破冰
    世界上第一艘原子破冰船，现在建造得怎样了呢？是不是快完成了？这是好多人感兴趣的一件事。现在请看一下这张照片，就可以看出它已快建成了。建造这只船的苏联列宁格勒造船厂的职工们决定在今年内让它下水，并给它起了个名字：“列宁”号。
    “列宁”号破冰船不仅在装有原子发动机方面站世界第一名，而且它还是世界上最大的破冰船。它的功率比美国最新的“格列切尔”号破冰船大一倍，而“格列切尔”号在目前被认为是功率最强的破冰船。“格列切尔”号的功率为二万二千匹马力，而原子破冰船的功率为四万四千匹马力。“列宁”号原子破冰船的长度为一百三十四公尺，最宽的地方为二十七点六公尺，排水量为一万六千吨，清水中的航速为每小时十八海里。
    为什么在建造世界上第一艘装有原子发动机的民用船时，苏联造船师们选择了破冰船，而不选择商船或客船呢？这是因为在北极地带航行，燃料是首要问题。装有原子发动机的破冰船，不加添燃料可以航行十二个月以上！它装的核子燃料可供沿赤道绕地球航行三次之用。因此不必为燃料问题担心。而用煤作燃料的破冰船，不增补燃料就只能航行二十昼夜；用石油作燃料的破冰船（柴油机电动破冰船），不增补燃料就只能航行四十昼夜。此外，用石油作燃料的破冰船在一昼夜内要烧七十吨燃料，原子破冰船一昼夜只需四十五公分核子燃料，这点燃料一个火柴盒就容得下。
    “列宁”号原子破冰船的船身没用一根铆钉，而是用特种钢焊接成的。二十六吨重的巨大的船首柱已焊接完毕。船的各部分的装配工作已经完成。现在正在塑造涡轮发电机和其他机械的基座。原子反应堆的功率等于一个能供有五十万居民的城市用的发电站功率。
    核子燃料是怎样用来开动破冰船的呢？原子反应堆中的原子“火焰”烧热在高压下循环的水。这种水具有危险的放射性。水在热交换器中把自己的热传给另一支水回路（这支水回路同核子反应过程是绝缘的，对人没有危险）。蒸气进入涡轮发电机，发电机送电流给船用发动机。
    原子船上的所有过程——从反应堆的工作到开辟航路，都由电子自动调节器控制。操作员只须给自动调节器下命令，从它那里得到操作过程的消息。实际上，整个原子船是一个极其复杂的技术建筑物，是一部符合原子和电子时代的最新技术的机械。
