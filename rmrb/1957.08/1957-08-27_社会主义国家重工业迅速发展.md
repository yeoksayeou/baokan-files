　　Socialist Countries' Heavy Industry Develops Rapidly
    ·Soviet Union·
　　Building a blast furnace at the world's fastest speed
    The Ilyich Steel Factory in Zhdanov City, Donbass, recently built a blast furnace at the world's fastest speed. It took only 153 days from the start of construction to completion, breaking the world record set by the Dzerzhinsky Steel Factory in Ukraine last year, which took six months to build a new type of blast furnace.
    Bokatariov, an old worker who participated in the construction of this blast furnace, said, "I have been engaged in the construction of blast furnaces for more than twenty-five years, but I have never seen such a fast speed as that achieved by the new blast furnace at the Ilyich factory."
    The effective volume of the new blast furnace in the Ilyich Steel Factory is twice as large as the old one. Its entire operation process is mechanized and automated. An average of only 800 people participated in the construction of this blast furnace.
    ·Romania·
　　Oil industry ranks among the world's most advanced
    Currently, Romania ranks first in Europe in terms of per capita oil production; compared with the world's major countries, it is second only to the United States.
    Last year, Romania's oil production reached 11 million tons. Based on the country's 17 million population, each person averaged more than 647 kilograms of oil.
    The Romanian oil industry has a history of a full hundred years since the establishment of the first refinery. At the very beginning of the oil industry's creation, Romania's annual oil production once ranked first in the world.
    Under the people's democratic regime, Romania's oil industry has greatly developed. Compared with 1947, oil production has approximately doubled, the total depth of drilling has increased approximately twenty-six times, and the number of oil wells has approximately doubled. At the same time, oil processing capacity has also increased from 3.5 million tons to 11 million tons. During this period, many new oil-producing areas have also been discovered. The Carpathian Mountains are almost everywhere with oil deposits.
    At present, Romania's oil processing equipment manufacturing industry can not only meet domestic needs, but also produce drilling equipment for export. With rich experience, the Romanian oil industry also provides technical assistance to China, India, and other countries.
    ·Czechoslovakia·
　　Preliminary achievements in inspecting basic construction
    All sectors of the Czechoslovak national economy are currently conducting comprehensive inspections of basic construction savings. The purpose of the inspection is to ensure that the various basic construction projects that have been started and will be started comply with the principles of thrift. A point of particular importance is whether certain new projects can be avoided in existing enterprises and production can be expanded by means of reconstruction, equipment innovation, or equipment exchange, in order to make full use of existing equipment. One of the shortcomings to be overcome in the inspection is the phenomenon of excessively high design standards and waste caused by some units exaggerating actual needs. Reducing the share of buildings in the total investment in basic construction and increasing the share of machinery and equipment is also an important issue. Currently in Czechoslovakia, investment in machinery and equipment accounts for an average of 35% of the total investment in basic construction. The government points out that this share is too low.
    The basic construction savings inspection is one of the specific measures to implement the resolution of the February plenary session of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party on improving the efficiency of the national economy. It is being carried out based on the government's decision made in early July. Although this work has only recently begun, it has already achieved preliminary results.

　　社会主义国家重工业迅速发展
    ·苏联·
　　用世界最快速度建成一高炉
    顿巴斯日丹诺夫城的伊里奇钢铁工厂最近用世界最快的速度建成了一座高炉。它从开始建设到建成，总共只用了一百五十三天，打破了乌克兰的捷尔任斯基钢铁工厂去年用六个月时间建成一座新型高炉的世界纪录。
    参加这座高炉的建设工作的老工人鲍卡特廖夫说，“我从事建设高炉的工作已经二十五年多了，可是，从来还没有见到过伊里奇工厂这座新高炉所达到的这样快的速度”。
    伊里奇钢铁工厂的新高炉的有效容积比这里原有的旧高炉大一倍。它的全部操作过程都是机械化和自动化的。参加这座高炉的建设工作的平均只有八百人。
    ·罗马尼亚·
　　石油工业列入世界先进行列
    按人口平均计算，目前罗马尼亚石油产量在欧洲占第一位；同世界上最主要的国家相比，仅次于美国。
    去年，罗马尼亚的石油产量达到一千一百万吨。按全国一千七百万人口计算，每人平均可获得石油六百四十七公斤多。
    罗马尼亚的石油工业自从建立第一个炼油厂到现在，已经有了整整一百年的历史。在石油工业创立的一开始，罗马尼亚的石油年产量就曾经占世界第一位。
    在人民民主政权之下，罗马尼亚的石油工业有了很大发展。同1947年相比，石油产量约增加两倍，钻井的总深度约增加二十六倍，油井的数目约增加一倍。同时，石油加工的能力也从三百五十万吨增加到一千一百万吨。在这个期间，还发现了不少新的产油区。喀尔巴阡山山脉几乎到处都埋藏有石油。
    目前，罗马尼亚制造石油加工设备的工业不仅能够满足国内的需要，而且还生产供出口用的钻探设备。拥有丰富经验的罗马尼亚的石油工业还向中国、印度和其他国家提供技术援助。
    ·捷克斯洛伐克·
　　检查基本建设取得初步成就
    捷克斯洛伐克国民经济各部门目前正在进行全面的基本建设节约检查。检查的目的是要使得已经开工的和将开工的各种基本建设项目合乎节约原则。受到特别重视的一点是：在现有企业中是否可以不增建某些新的项目，而采用改建、革新设备或者交换设备的办法来扩大生产，以充分利用现有的设备。检查中要克服的缺点之一是由于某些单位夸大实际需要而造成的设计标准过高和浪费现象。减少建筑物在基本建设总投资中所占的份额，提高机器设备的份额，也是一个重要的问题。目前在捷克斯洛伐克，机器设备投资在基本建设总投资中平均占35％。政府指出这一份额是太低了。
    基本建设节约检查是执行今年2月捷共中央全会关于提高国民经济效能的决议的具体措施之一，它是根据政府在7月初作出的决定进行的。目前这一工作虽然开始不久，但是已经取得初步成就。
