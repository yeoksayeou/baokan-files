Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, August 30th: Albanian Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Shehu, received American "New York Times" reporter Harrison E. Salisbury on August 28th and answered eleven questions he raised.

When answering questions about Albanian-American relations, Shehu said that Albania is willing to establish normal diplomatic relations with the United States on the basis of equality, mutual respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity, national independence, non-interference in internal affairs, and the principles of peaceful coexistence. The reason why such relations have not yet been established is only due to the obstruction of the US policy towards Albania.

The reporter asked how the United States should assist Albania. Shehu said that a foundation exists for developing trade between the two countries, but Albania would find it difficult to accept the existing forms of US aid. He also said that developing Albanian-American cultural exchanges is possible.

The American reporter raised a series of provocative questions regarding Albanian-Soviet relations, such as the so-called Albania not having an independent foreign policy and being a "vassal state" of the Soviet Union, etc. Shehu sternly refuted these slanderous remarks. Shehu emphasized that Albania's relations with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries are based on the principles of equality, friendship, mutual respect, non-interference in internal affairs, cooperation, and mutual assistance. Albania is a free, independent, and sovereign state. You cannot find a so-called "vassal state" in the people's democracies; if you want to find "vassal states," you can only find them in Taiwan and South Korea. Shehu also refuted the reporter's rumors that Albania is conducting anti-American propaganda.

Shehu answered the American reporter's questions regarding Albania's economy and the living standards of the people with the great achievements and specific figures of Albania over the past thirteen years. He emphasized that Soviet economic assistance plays a paramount role in developing Albania's national economy.

The American reporter asked about the prospects for Albanian-Yugoslav relations. Shehu said that both Albania and Yugoslavia are countries building socialism, and there is no other path for the relationship between the two countries other than the road of socialist development. Our relations are being continuously improved on the basis of equality, friendship, cooperation, and non-interference in internal affairs. We believe that all socialist countries are members of one big family, and they should solve problems and develop relations within this big family.

Shehu also emphasized that Albania is willing to establish normal relations with all countries with different social systems, as long as they are willing to do so.

　　谢胡驳斥美记者挑拨阿苏关系
　  表示阿尔巴尼亚愿同美国建立邦交
    新华社地拉那30日电　阿尔巴尼亚部长会议主席谢胡8月28日接见了美国“纽约时报”记者哈·伊·索耳兹伯里，并且回答了他所提出的十一个问题。
    谢胡在回答阿美关系问题的时候说，阿尔巴尼亚愿意在平等、互相尊重主权、领土完整、国家独立和互不干涉内政的基础上以及在和平共处的原则上同美国建立正常的外交关系。这种关系所以至今还未建立只是由于受到美国对阿政策的阻挠。
    记者问美国应如何来援助阿尔巴尼亚，谢胡说，发展两国之间的贸易的基础是存在的，但是像现有的美援方式，阿尔巴尼亚是难以接受的。他又说，发展阿美文化交流是可以的。
    美国记者提出了一连串有关阿苏关系的挑衅性的问题，如所谓阿尔巴尼亚没有独立的外交政策，是苏联的“附庸国”等等，谢胡严正地驳斥了这些诬蔑性言论。谢胡着重指出，阿尔巴尼亚同苏联和其他社会主义国家的关系是建立在平等、友好、互相尊重和互不干涉内政、合作和互助的原则上的。阿尔巴尼亚是自由、独立的主权国家。在人民民主国家中是找不到所谓“附庸国”的，要找“附庸国”只有到台湾和南朝鲜去找。谢胡还驳斥了记者所提出的阿尔巴尼亚正在进行反美宣传的谰言。
    谢胡以阿尔巴尼亚十三年来的巨大成绩和具体数字回答了美国记者所提出的有关阿尔巴尼亚经济和人民生活水平的问题。他着重指出，苏联的经济援助在发展阿尔巴尼亚国民经济方面起着头等重要的作用。
    美国记者问到阿南关系的前景如何，谢胡说，阿南两国都是建设社会主义的国家，除了社会主义发展的道路外，两国的关系就不会有其他的道路。我们之间的关系是在以平等、友好、合作、互不干涉内政的基础上来取得不断改善的。我们认为，所有的社会主义国家都是一个大家庭的成员，他们应该在这个大家庭内解决问题、发展关系。
    谢胡还着重指出，阿尔巴尼亚愿意同社会制度不同的各国建立正常的关系，只要他们愿意这样做。
