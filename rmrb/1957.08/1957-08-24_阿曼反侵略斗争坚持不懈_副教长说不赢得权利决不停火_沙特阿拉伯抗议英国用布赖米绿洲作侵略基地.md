Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, August 22nd: Oman's Deputy Imam, Salah bin Issa, said today upon arriving in Cairo from Saudi Arabia that the fighting in Oman is still continuing, and the so-called announcement of the withdrawal of British troops is merely imperialist propaganda. He said that Oman would not negotiate peace or a ceasefire until it had won its rights. He said that he was carrying letters from the Imam to Egyptian President Nasser. While in Saudi Arabia, he met with the Saudi King and it has been decided to bring the Oman issue before the United Nations, and if necessary, he will go to New York.

Xinhua News Agency, August 23rd, New York dispatch: The Saudi Arabian government wrote to the United Nations Secretariat on August 22nd, protesting Britain's use of the Buraimi Oasis base to invade Oman.

The Saudi Arabian government pointed out in the letter that the Buraimi Oasis is a disputed area, and its ownership remains to be judged based on the arbitration agreement concluded between Saudi Arabia and Britain. The gathering of British troops there violates both the arbitration agreement and international law.

The Saudi Arabian government holds the British government fully responsible for all resulting responsibilities and consequences.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, August 22nd: The Egyptian Red Crescent Society protested on August 21st against the British authorities for preventing its delegation from entering Oman to treat Omanis who had suffered under British aggression.

The Red Crescent Society received a report from the head of its delegation stating that the delegation had attempted to cross from Saudi Arabia into Oman but was stopped by British troops. The General Society has lodged this protest with the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva.

　　阿曼反侵略斗争坚持不懈
　  副教长说不赢得权利决不停火
    沙特阿拉伯抗议英国用布赖米绿洲作侵略基地
    新华社开罗22日电　阿曼副教长萨拉赫·本·伊萨今天在从沙特阿拉伯到达开罗的时候说，阿曼的战斗仍旧在继续中，所谓英国军队已经撤退的公告只是帝国主义的宣传。他说，阿曼在赢得自己的权利以前决不谈判和平或者停火。他说，他带有教长给埃及总统纳赛尔的信件。他在沙特阿拉伯的时候曾经会见沙特国王。并已经决定把阿曼问题向联合国提出，如果必要，他将去纽约。
    新华社23日讯　纽约消息：沙特阿拉伯政府8月22日写信给联合国秘书处，抗议英国利用布赖米绿洲基地来侵略阿曼。
    沙特阿拉伯政府在信中指出，布赖米绿洲是争执中的地区，它的所有权还有待于根据沙特阿拉伯和英国缔结的仲裁协定来作出判决。英军在那里集结，既违反仲裁协定，也违反国际法。
    沙特阿拉伯政府要英国政府承当由此而产生的全部责任和后果。
    新华社开罗22日电　埃及红新月会8月21日抗议英国当局阻止它的代表团进入阿曼救治在英国侵略下受害的阿曼人。
    红新月会接到它的代表团团长的报告说，代表团曾经试图由沙特阿拉伯过境进入阿曼，但是被英国军队阻止住了。总会已经向日内瓦的红十字国际委员会提出了这项抗议。
