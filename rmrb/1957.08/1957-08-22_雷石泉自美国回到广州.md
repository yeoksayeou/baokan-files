　  Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 20th. Lei Shiquan, former third secretary of the Chiang Kai-shek Group's "Delegation" to the United Nations, returned to Guangzhou last night from the United States with his wife, Kuang Shuhui, and a nine-year-old son. Two American students, Zhang Jingzhe and Xu Xianwei, also returned to Guangzhou with them.

　  Lei Shiquan is from Anhui. He went to the United States in the spring of 1947. Before 1950, Lei served as "Vice Consul" in the Chiang Kai-shek Group's "Consulate" in Chicago for three years, and later served as third secretary in the Chiang Kai-shek Group's "Delegation" to the United Nations for five years. He told Xinhua News Agency reporters that before returning to China, he had been threatened by personnel from the Chiang Kai-shek Group's "Consulate General" in New York and harassed by agents of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation, even though he had resigned from his position as third secretary in June 1955.
