    Remembering the Hero Yang Gensi
    Zhang Leping
    Since childhood, I have been familiar with many heroes in "Water Margin" and "Romance of the Three Kingdoms." I admired their bold and frank characters and yearned for their glorious deeds. Since then, I have always dreamed of seeing such heroes with my own eyes.
    In the early summer of 1950, the literary and art circles of Shanghai went to the suburbs to attend a heroic model conference of a certain army of the People's Liberation Army, and I was honored to have the opportunity to participate. On the night I received the notice, I was so excited that I couldn't sleep. Tomorrow, I will see the heroes I have longed for. They are heroes in the cause of liberation, and they are more noble and greater than heroes of any past era. I kept thinking about how I should pay tribute to them, learn from them, and how to express them through my paintings after seeing them.
    When we arrived at our destination, we were received at the guest house. Everyone was settling their luggage when we suddenly heard the sound of gongs and drums, applause, and firecrackers. Through the ranks of cheering crowds, we saw a team of neatly marching soldiers, surrounding a young military man of twenty-four or five years old, riding a white horse draped in silk and ribbons. The troops were sending off their selected heroes to report. I stared straight at the hero on the horse. He was tall and sturdy, with bright eyes. He was the famous blasting hero Yang Gensi.
    The next day, the model evaluation conference began. Heroes from all walks of life were divided into groups for evaluation. When Yang Gensi ran to the podium, the venue erupted in a storm of applause. But when he started speaking, the venue quickly became very quiet. Yang Gensi was not used to speaking in front of a microphone. He moved around on the stage from time to time. He was not good at speaking, and because of the humility unique to people's heroes, he seemed unnatural when speaking, pulling his belt from time to time, raising his head slightly, recalling and narrating. But when he spoke to the crucial point, his voice became loud, his eyes shining, and he gnashed his teeth as if the enemy were right in front of him.
    Yang Gensi was from Jinghu Township, Taixing County, Jiangsu Province. He was born into a poor peasant family. In order to make a living, he came to Shanghai at a young age and worked as an apprentice in a carpet factory. He worked for eight years and suffered all kinds of exploitation. In 1944, he returned to his hometown and saw the Japanese invaders and puppet troops oppressing the people, so he resolutely joined the New Fourth Army. In 1946, in the battle of Guoliji near Zaozhuang in southern Shandong, he braved the misty night rain and blasted down the enemy's densely layered deer stockades layer by layer. Finally, he broke through the enemy's crossfire and destroyed the enemy's bunker, occupied an important stronghold, and opened up a path to victory. In this battle, he won the glorious title of "Blasting King." Later, he established many more military exploits.
    At the conference, I was so engrossed in listening that I didn't draw a portrait of him, which I felt very regretful about. The next day, I asked the organization to draw a portrait for him, and he agreed. We met in a reception room. He kindly asked me, "Do you want me to sit or stand for the painting?" I asked him to sit, and he sat down. The comrade standing next to him said with a smile, "Yang Gensi is suffering now!" He immediately replied, "You're talking nonsense. The painter is suffering because he is working hard to paint my portrait. What am I suffering?" After saying that, he laughed himself. It turned out that he had a very active personality. Sure enough, less than two minutes after I started painting, I noticed that he looked a little uneasy. Because he勉强坚持, sweat was breaking out on his forehead. I asked him if he wanted to take a break. He wiped his sweat and said with a smile, "It's okay, it's okay!" which made everyone laugh. Because I didn't want to make him too uncomfortable, I quickly finished the work in the form of a sketch, and then asked him to sign the painting. When we parted, he shook my hand tightly.
    Not long after the heroic model conference, the nationwide movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea was launched. In the winter of that year, news came that Yang Gensi had heroically sacrificed on the Korean front. At that time, I was bedridden, reading the news of his sacrifice repeatedly with great grief and indignation. I asked my wife to take out his portrait and kept looking at his autograph. I thought of the hand that signed the name, which was also the hand that finally pulled the detonator pack and rushed towards the enemy, perishing with them.
    The portrait I drew for Yang Gensi, although it does not express his lofty ideals and heroic temperament, but on this painting, there is Yang Gensi's handwriting. I would like to dedicate this painting to the Yang Gensi Martyrs Memorial Hall, so that the people can commemorate Yang Gensi, learn from Yang Gensi, and create great achievements in socialist construction like Yang Gensi created in the war.

    怀念英雄杨根思
    张乐平
    我自小熟悉“水浒”和“三国演义”里的许多英雄人物，我喜爱他们的豪迈坦率的性格，向往着他们的叱咤风云的事迹。从那时候起，我一直梦想着自己能亲眼看见这样的英雄人物。
    1950年初夏，上海文艺界去近郊列席解放军某军的英模大会，我也光荣地得到参加的机会。接到通知的当天晚上，我兴奋得睡不着觉。明天，我就要见着想望已久的英雄人物了，他们是解放事业中的英雄，他们比过去任何时代的英雄都要崇高伟大。我一直想着，见了他们之后应该怎样向他们致敬，向他们学习；怎样通过我的画笔来表现他们。
    到了目的地，我们被接待到招待所，大家正在安顿行李，忽然听到锣鼓喧天，掌声爆竹声响成一片，透过夹道欢呼的行列，我们看到一队步伐整齐的战士，拥着一位二十四、五岁的青年军人，跨着一匹披绸结彩的白马过来。各部队欢送自己选出的英雄来报到了。我直望着那马上的英雄，他身材瘦长而结实，两眼炯炯发光。他就是著名爆破英雄杨根思。
    第二天评模大会开始了，各路英雄分组进行评选，当选的英雄都向大会报告自己的事迹。杨根思跑向讲台的时候，会场里响起暴风雨般的掌声，而等他开始发言时，会场一会儿就变得很肃静了。杨根思不习惯在扩音器前讲话，他不时在台上走动着，他不善于讲话，更因为有着人民英雄所特有的谦逊，在讲话时显得不很自然，不时地拉着腰带，微昂着头，一边回忆一边讲述，而当他讲到紧要关头的时候，声音洪亮起来，眼睛闪着光，咬牙切齿，好像敌人就在他面前。
    杨根思是江苏泰兴县井湖乡人，贫农出身，为了糊口，幼年就到上海来，在一家地毯厂当学徒，做了八年工，受尽了被剥削的痛苦。1944年回到家乡，看到日寇和伪军欺压人民，就毅然参加了新四军。1946年，在鲁南枣庄附近的郭里集战斗中，他冒着蒙蒙的夜雨，一层又一层地炸垮敌人的密密层层的鹿砦，最后穿过敌人的交叉火网，炸毁了敌人的碉堡，占领了重要据点，开辟了胜利道路。在这次战斗中，他获得了“爆炸大王”的光荣称号。以后他又建立了许多战功。
    在大会上，我因为听得出神，没有给他画像，觉得很遗憾。第二天，通过组织要求为他画像，他答应了。我们在一间会客室里见了面，他亲切地问我：“坐着画还是站着画？”我请他坐着，他就坐下了。站在旁边的同志笑着说：“这下杨根思受罪了！”他立刻回答说：“你胡说，画家辛苦为我画像才受罪，我有啥受罪？”说完他自己也笑起来了。原来他个性非常好动，果然，我动笔不到两分钟，就发现他有些不安的样子，因为勉强坚持，额角上都冒了汗了。我问他是否要休息一下，他一边揩汗一边笑着说：“没关系，没关系！”引得大家都笑了起来。我因为不愿使他过于难受，就用速写的形式，赶快完了工，又请他在画上签了名。在分别时，他和我紧紧地握手。
    英模大会后不久，全国展开了抗美援朝运动，就在当年冬天，传来杨根思在朝鲜前线壮烈牺牲的噩耗。那时我正卧病在床，怀着十分悲愤的心情，反复地读着报道他的牺牲的消息，我让妻子拿出他的画像，一直审视着他的亲笔签名，我想到他签名的手，也就是他最后拉响炸药包冲向敌人，与敌人同归于尽的手。
    我为杨根思画的画像，虽然没有表现出他的崇高思想和英雄气质，但是在这张画上，留着杨根思的笔迹，我愿将这幅画献给杨根思烈士纪念馆，让人民纪念杨根思，向杨根思学习，在社会主义建设中，创造出像杨根思在战争中所创造出的丰功伟绩。　　1957年7月27日
