    At a Debate Meeting in an Agricultural Cooperative
    The Xing'an Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Gaocheng County, Hebei Province, vigorously launched a socialist debate. Wang Luo, a seventy-five-year-old cooperative member, said at the debate meeting: "Some people say that the advanced cooperative is not good, but I say the advanced cooperative is good. If it weren't for the advanced cooperative, how could I be taken care of? Our village has suffered from disasters for four consecutive years, but we still have food, clothing, and pocket money to spend. If it weren't for the government implementing the unified purchase and sale of grain, we wouldn't even have chaff to eat." Wang Luo used to be a beggar before liberation and is now one of the cooperative's "five guarantees" households.

    在一个农业社的辩论会上
    河北省藁城县兴安村农业生产合作社大张旗鼓地开展了社会主义大辩论。七十五岁的老社员王洛向在辩论会上说：“有人说高级社不好，我说高级社就是好，要不是高级社凭什么把我包起来？咱村连续受灾四年，又有吃，又有穿，还有零钱花，要不是政府实行粮食统购统销，咱们吃糠都没有。”王洛向在解放前讨过饭，现在是社里的五保户。
