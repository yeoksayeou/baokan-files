　　Greeting the Upsurge of Socialist Ideological Education in the Countryside

　　Over a Thousand University Teachers, Students, and Cadres from the Capital Go to the Countryside

　　(Reported by this newspaper) A large-scale debate on which path to take, socialism or capitalism, is about to unfold extensively in the rural areas of the outskirts of Beijing.

　　The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has organized a working group of over 1,200 staff members from various agencies and university teachers and students to assist the Party organizations in various townships and communes in presiding over this major debate. On August 23rd, the Municipal Committee convened a meeting of cadres from each working group, where Comrade Chen Peng, Secretary of the Municipal Committee, delivered a report on how to conduct the major debate. Currently, the personnel of each working group are gathering in the suburban districts to study the experience of pilot townships in launching the "airing of views" and to familiarize themselves with local conditions. They will be dispatched to the townships one after another in the coming days.

　　Before this major debate is widely launched, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party first selected eight townships in the suburban rural areas as pilot projects to gain experience. Some leading members of the Municipal Committee and the secretaries of the district committees of the suburban areas personally went to the countryside to lead the pilot work. At present, all pilot projects have started airing their views. During the airing, the masses freely exchanged their opinions on issues such as the unified purchase and sale of grain and other agricultural products, and agricultural collectivization, while also integrating with the work of their own township and commune. Some issues have already sparked debate during the airing.

　　迎接农村社会主义思想教育的高潮
　　首都一千多名大学师生和干部下乡
    本报讯　北京市郊区农村即将广泛开展社会主义和资本主义两条道路何去何从的大辩论。
    中共北京市委员会已经组织了各机关工作人员和高等学校师生共一千二百多人，成立工作组到农村去协助各乡社的党组织主持这场大辩论。8月23日，市委召集了各工作组的干部开会，由市委书记陈鹏同志作如何开展大辩论的报告。目前各工作组人员正集中在各郊区，学习各试点乡开展鸣放的经验和熟悉当地情况，日内就要先后下到各乡去。
    在这场大辩论广泛开展以前，中共北京市委先在郊区农村中选择了八个乡做为试点，吸取经验。市委的一些领导人员和各郊区区委书记都亲自下乡领导试点工作。目前各试点都已经鸣放起来，鸣放中群众环绕着粮食和其他农产品统购统销、农业合作化等问题，并结合本乡本社的工作，畅所欲言地交换了意见。有些问题已经在鸣放中展开争论。
