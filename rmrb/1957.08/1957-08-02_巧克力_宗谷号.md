    Chocolate "Soya"
    The Japanese Antarctic exploration ship "Soya," with the help of the Soviet research vessel "Ob," finally escaped danger and returned to Japan at the end of April this year. At that time, Nagasaki City happened to be holding a National Confectionery Exposition, where a chocolate model of the "Soya" was specially made. The candy weighed 37.5 kilograms and could serve 100 people.

    巧克力“宗谷号”
    日本的南极探险船“宗谷号”，在苏联考察船“鄂毕号”的救助下，终于在今年4月底，脱险回到日本。这时，长崎市刚好开展日本全国点心博览会，会上特地替它制出了“宗谷号”模型的巧克力糖，此糖全重三十七公斤半，能供给一百个人的食用。
