Dulles's "Premature Senility"
	Cui Qi

	On the issue of American journalists visiting China, Dulles has now taken a step back in the face of relentless reality, "proposing" that "a limited number of journalists" be allowed to come to China for interviews.

	The dispute between the American press and the U.S. State Department over the issue of journalists visiting China has been going on for almost a year. Initially, Dulles had "unwaveringly" announced to American journalists: they were not allowed to go to China! As for the reasons, there were many; according to his own count, there were more than twenty. However, it is unavoidable to make Dulles sad to say that, in less than a year, these twenty-odd "reasons" have "vanished" one after another, like soap bubbles.

	Now, Dulles's bet on the issue of journalists visiting China has been completely lost. However, he does not want to admit defeat, but wants to renege on the debt, reneging as much as he can. While agreeing that journalists could visit China, he also put forward a long list of conditions: first, to limit the number of people; second, to select journalists; and third, to stipulate the duration of the interviews. The third point has been specifically stipulated as six months, which is said to be a "trial" period.

	As in the past, Dulles had just left one "contradiction" and stepped into another "contradiction." May I ask, since it is agreed that some journalists can visit China, how can one oppose other journalists visiting China? As the "New York Times" said, "It is more consistent to refuse to issue passports altogether than to issue passports to some people and refuse to issue passports to others."

	The American press believes that Dulles's approach is actually still using American journalists as tools of foreign policy. The "New York Times" wrote: "If the State Department distinguishes between those who can go to Red China and those who cannot go to Red China, then it is actually designating the journalists who are sent. This type of journalist selected in this way is likely to be regarded as an agent of the State Department rather than an independent journalist." The "Wall Street Journal" said: "As for the 'trial' period, it unpleasantly sounds as if the State Department intends to arbitrarily criticize news reports from China." In fact, how can it be just "sounds like" it? Dulles's intention is clearly: he wants to classify all American journalists as State Department employees and stipulate a probationary period of six months. If they do not please the State Department, then of course they will be disqualified from the probationary period...

	Does anyone recognize Dulles's right to do this? No. Dulles is his own commander. The "New York Times" pointed out: "We cannot assume that Secretary of State Dulles... is qualified to decide for us to what extent news from Red China should be reported and by whom." "Secretary of State Dulles has no right to stipulate the number of journalists who can go to Red China or to refuse to issue passports to those who are willing to go."

	So, what exactly is causing Dulles to be so muddle-headed? The "Wall Street Journal" answered this question in its editorial on July 22. It wrote: "The State Department's hesitation in letting American journalists go to Red China to report is a symbol of the aggravation of our country's policy confusion towards the Beijing regime. The entire policy is increasingly showing signs of a personal split." The "Wall Street Journal" also called this situation the State Department's "initial premature senility." This diagnosis is not without reason. Indeed, anyone who stubbornly refuses to acknowledge the facts, daydreams every day, and likes to fantasize will gradually lose their sense of reality, lose their memory, and eventually lose their sanity. Such a person must speak incoherently and "contradictorily." People know that Mr. Dulles has probably been suffering from this disease for more than just the "initial" stage.

	The "Wall Street Journal" also prescribed a remedy for this disease. It believes: "The cure is to make a clear distinction between what truly belongs within its purview and what does not." However, can this remedy really cure the disease? Probably not. To treat those who suffer from "senility" due to refusing to acknowledge the facts, the best way is to have them run into all kinds of hard-as-iron facts, and the more they run into them, the harder they run into them, the greater the possibility that the symptoms will improve. We have already seen, and will continue to see, that this is the only effective remedy for treating Mr. Dulles's "premature senility."

### 杜勒斯的“早发性痴呆症”

    杜勒斯的“早发性痴呆症”
    崔奇
    在美国记者访问中国的问题上，杜勒斯现在在无情的现实面前退了一步，“提议”“有限的记者”可以到中国来采访。
    美国新闻界和美国国务院之间关于记者访华问题的争论，闹了快一年了。开头，杜勒斯曾经“毫不动摇”地向美国记者们宣布：不许到中国去！至于理由，那是很多的；据他自己统计，足足有二十个以上。但是，说起来不免要使杜勒斯伤心，在不到一年的时间里，这二十几个“理由”，就像肥皂泡一样，一个接着一个都“消逝”了。
    现在，杜勒斯在记者访华问题上所押的赌注，算是完全输光了。然而他并不想认输，却想赖账，得赖且赖。他在同意记者访华的同时，又提出了一大串的条件：一要限制人数，二要挑选记者，三要规定采访时间。其中第三条已经具体规定为六个月，据说这叫做“试验”时期。
    和过去的情形一样，杜勒斯刚刚离开一个“前后矛盾”，就又走进另一个“前后矛盾”。试问，既然同意一部分记者可以访华，那么又怎么能够反对其他的记者访华呢？正如“纽约时报”所说，“完全拒绝发给护照比发给某些人护照而拒绝发给其他人护照还前后一致些。”
    美国新闻界认为，杜勒斯这种做法实际上还是要美国记者充当外交政策的工具。“纽约时报”写道：“如果国务院把那些可以去赤色中国同不可以去赤色中国的人加以区别的话，那么它实际上就是指派去的记者。这样挑选出来的这种记者很可能被认为是国务院的代理人而不是独立的记者。”“华尔街日报”说：“至于‘试验’时期，令人不愉快地听来好像是国务院打算随意批评从中国来的新闻稿件。”其实，何止是“好像”呢？杜勒斯的打算明明是：他想把美国记者统统划为国务院的职员，并且规定试用期间为六个月，如果他们不中国务院的心意，那么当然就要被取消试用的资格……。
    难道有谁会承认杜勒斯的这种权利吗？没有。杜勒斯是自己挂帅的。“纽约时报”指出：“我们不能够认为国务卿杜勒斯……有资格来替我们决定赤色中国的新闻应该报道到什么程度和由谁来报道。”“国务卿杜勒斯没有权利规定可以去赤色中国的记者的人数或者拒绝把护照发给那些愿意去的人。”
    那么，究竟是什么原因使得杜勒斯这样昏头昏脑？“华尔街日报”在7月22日的社论中回答了这个问题。它写道：“国务院在让美国记者去赤色中国从事报道这个问题上犹豫不决，是我国对北京政权的政策混乱加重的象征。整个政策日益表现出一种人身分裂的迹象。”“华尔街日报”并且把这种状况称为国务院的“初期的早发性痴呆症”。这个诊断是不无道理的。的确，任何人，如果他顽固地不承认事实，每天作白日梦，喜欢妄想，那么渐渐地就会失去现实感，失去记忆力，最后失去理智。这种人讲起话来就一定是语无伦次，“前后矛盾”。人们知道，杜勒斯先生害这种病症，恐怕已经不止是“初期的”了。
    “华尔街日报”还为这种病症开了药方。它认为：“治疗的办法就是在确实属于它分内的事情和不属于它分内的事情之间作出明确的区分。”可是，这个药方真能治病吗？恐怕未必。要治疗那些由于不承认事实而害“痴呆症”的人们，最好的办法就是要他们在各种各样的坚硬如铁的事实面前碰壁，碰得越多，碰得越重，病状改善的可能性才会越大些。我们已经看到，还会继续看到，这是治疗杜勒斯先生“早发性痴呆症”的唯一有效的药方。
