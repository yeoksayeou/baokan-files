A Right-Wing Commentary from a Local Newspaper:

　　What Kind of "Freedom of Speech" Are Rightists Contending For?

　　During the "Blooming and Contending" period, bourgeois rightists attacked the Party-led state for "lacking freedom of speech." They said, "This era is an era when the people dare not speak."

　　Our country is a country where the people are the masters, and the people have never had so much right to speak on social life and national affairs as they do today. In every People's Congress at all levels, the representatives speak freely, representing the people and making criticisms and suggestions on the work of the Party and the government. Newspapers and radio stations often publish a large amount of people's opinions and reflect the people's demands. However, rightists clamor loudly, "This era is an era when the people dare not speak." The implication is that in order to obtain "freedom of speech," we must fundamentally change our national system and change this era. Faced with the same society and the same era, their views are so different. People can't help but ask: What kind of "people" are those who say "people dare not speak in this era" speaking for, and what kind of "freedom of speech" are they fighting for? The "freedom of speech" they are fighting for is precisely the freedom to spread anti-Party and anti-socialist speech. The purpose of their enthusiastic pursuit of "freedom of speech" is to use this "freedom," once they have it in their hands, to create public opinion, cultivate anti-socialist forces, disintegrate the people's democratic dictatorship, and undermine the construction of the socialist state. We ask, can our country give such "people" such freedom of speech? No.

　　Rightists say that "people dare not say bad things about the Party and the government." The fact is not so. Everyone knows that criticism and self-criticism are an extremely important part of our country's democratic life and the Party's life. The Constitution stipulates that our citizens have the legal right to criticize the shortcomings and errors in the work of state organs and to lodge complaints against state personnel who violate the law or neglect their duties. Why do some people say that "people dare not say bad things about the Party and the government"? It turns out that there is also the question of from what standpoint to "say bad things" and how to say them. When the people say that certain work of the Party and the government is "bad," it is from the standpoint of loving the Party and safeguarding socialism, it is well-intentioned, and it is for the sake of doing the work of the Party and the government better, and the Party and the government certainly welcome it. However, when rightists say "bad things" about the Party and the government, they are standing on a hostile position of opposing the leadership of the Communist Party and opposing socialism, and they fundamentally negate the Party and the socialist cause. This is malicious. What the rightists are fighting for is the freedom to "say bad things about the Party and the government" in this way.

　　Rightists also believe that in our society, whoever says a word is immediately associated with their thoughts, and the roots of their thoughts are traced, which will "hinder people's freedom of speech." We say that a person's speech reflects their thoughts, and wrong speech inevitably reflects wrong thoughts. Frequently linking people's words and actions with their thoughts, and digging out the old ideological roots in order to carry out political and ideological education, so that people consciously overcome those ideological consciousnesses that are unfavorable to the new society, and establish socialist, collectivist, and wholeheartedly serving the people's thinking, which is beneficial to the socialist cause, what is wrong with this? Why are some people so afraid of having their words and thoughts "linked," and think that such a "link" "hinders freedom of speech"? To put it bluntly, the reason is that they are ideologically and politically opposed to the Party and socialism, and they have a guilty conscience. They are always afraid that the people will see through their reactionary ideological essence through their words.

　　"Newspapers always sing the same tune." Rightists believe that this shows a "lack of freedom of speech." We say that the newspapers in our country both sing the same tune and do not only sing one tune. The so-called singing the same tune means that the newspapers in our country are all newspapers that serve socialism, and they must sing the tune of strengthening the Party's leadership and inspiring the people to strive for socialism. The so-called not only singing one tune means that, under the premise of serving socialism, we can commend the labor achievements of Party and state workers and the working people, and we can also criticize the shortcomings and errors in the work of the Party and the state, and so on. There can be "controversies" of different opinions in the newspapers, but they are all for the benefit of socialism and the entire people, that is, only singing the tune of socialism. This will only inspire people's enthusiasm for loving the motherland, loving the people, and loving socialism, and inspire people to express more beneficial opinions. What does this have to do with the people "having no freedom of speech"?

　　In summary, the various absurdities of the rightists who slander the Party-led state for "lacking freedom of speech" are nothing more than to win freedom of speech for all reactionaries to oppose the Party and oppose socialism. They deliberately portray democracy and freedom as absolute things, as if in a country, no matter who it is, whoever wants to say what they want to say, and whoever wants to do what they want to do, without any restraint or criticism, that is true democracy and freedom, otherwise it is called "no democracy or freedom." Democracy is relative to centralism, and freedom is relative to discipline. The two opposing concepts exist as conditions for each other. That kind of abstract, absolute freedom cannot be found in any country on earth.

### 右派分子争的是什么样的“言论自由”

专栏：地方报上的反右派评论

　　右派分子争的是什么样的“言论自由”
    在“鸣放”期间，资产阶级右派分子攻击党领导的国家“没有言论自由”。他们说，“现时代是人民不敢讲话的时代”。
    我们的国家，是人民当家作主的国家，人民对社会生活、国家大事从来没有像今天这样多的发言的权利。各级的每次人民代表大会，代表们都是畅所欲言，代表人民群众对党和政府的工作提出批评和建议。报纸、广播电台经常以大量篇幅刊登群众的意见，反映群众的要求。但是，右派分子却大嚷大叫“现时代是人民不敢讲话的时代”。意思就是，要取得“言论自由”就必须从根本上改变我们的国家制度，改变这个时代。面对着同一个社会同一个时代，看法竟如此不同。人们不禁要问：那些说“现时代人民不敢讲话”的人，究竟是在替什么样的“人民”争取什么样的“言论自由”？他们所争的“言论自由”，正是放散反党、反社会主义言论的自由。他们这样热心地争取“言论自由”的目的，是要把这种“自由”一旦争到手里，就借此制造舆论，培植反社会主义势力，瓦解人民民主专政，破坏社会主义国家的建设。试问，我们的国家能够给这些“人民”以这样的言论自由吗？不能的。
    右派分子说什么“人们不敢说党和政府的不好”。事实也并非如此。尽人皆知，批评与自我批评，是我们国家民主生活和党的生活中的一项极重要的内容。宪法规定，我国公民可以对国家机关工作的缺点、错误进行批评，有对违法失职的国家工作人员进行控诉的合法权利。为什么有人说“人们不敢说党和政府的不好”呢？原来，这里还有个站在什么立场上“说不好”和怎样说法的问题。人民说党和政府的某些工作“不好”，是站在爱护党、维护社会主义的立场上，是善意的，是为了党和政府的工作作得更好，党和政府当然欢迎。而右派分子说党和政府的“不好”，则是站在反对共产党领导、反对社会主义的敌对立场上，把党和社会主义事业来个根本的否定。这是恶意的。右派分子所争的，就是如此这般“说党和政府不好”的自由。
    右派分子还认为，在我们的社会，谁说句话动不动就和思想联系起来，追思想根源，这样会“妨碍人们的言论自由”。我们说，一个人有什么样的言论，就有什么样的思想，有错误的言论就必然有错误的思想。经常把人们的言行和思想联系起来，把旧的思想根源挖掘出来，以便进行政治思想教育，使人们自觉地克服那些不利于新社会的思想意识，树立社会主义、集体主义和全心全意为人民服务的思想，以利于社会主义事业，这有什么不好呢？一些人为什么如此害怕将自己的言论和思想“联系起来”，并且认为这样一“联系”就“妨碍了言论自由”呢？一语道破，原来他们在思想上、政治上是反对党、反对社会主义的，作贼心虚，他们总是害怕人民透过他们的言论看破他们的这种反动的思想实质。
      “报纸总是唱一个调子”，右派分子认为这样就表现为“没有言论自由”。我们说，我们国家的报纸是既唱一个调子，又不是只唱一个调子。所谓唱一个调子，那就是，我们国家的报纸都是为社会主义服务的报纸，要唱加强党的领导、鼓舞人民为社会主义而奋斗的调子。所谓又不只唱一个调子，这就是，在为社会主义服务的前提下，可以表彰党和国家工作人员和劳动人民的劳动业绩，也可以批评党和国家工作中的缺点和错误，等等。报纸上可以有不同的意见的“争鸣”，但又都是为了社会主义和全体人民的利益，即只唱社会主义这样一个调子，这只会鼓舞人们爱祖国、爱人民、爱社会主义的热情，启发人民更多地发表有益的言论，这和人民“没有了言论自由”有什么相干呢？
    综上所述，右派分子辱骂党所领导的国家“没有言论自由”的种种谰调，其目的不外是为一切反动分子争得反对党反对社会主义的言论自由。他们故意把民主、自由说成是绝对化的东西，仿佛在一个国家，无论任何人，谁愿意怎样说就怎样说，愿意怎样行便怎样行，毫不受约束，不受批驳，那才是真正的民主、自由，否则就叫做“没有民主、自由”。民主是对集中而言，自由是对纪律而言，两个对立的概念是互为条件而存在的。那种抽象的、绝对的自由，在地球上任何国度里都是找不到的。
