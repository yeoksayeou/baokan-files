    Huang Jinsi's Reactionary Activities Supported by Lin Handa
    Minjin Shanghai Municipal Committee and Caoyang Middle School Launch Struggle Against Him

    (Our dispatch) The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy (Minjin) and Shanghai Caoyang Middle School have exposed the rightist Huang Jinsi, a member of Minjin.

    Huang Jinsi has been working at Caoyang Middle School for less than a year. He has engaged in various forms of sabotage against the work. During the wage reform, Huang Jinsi sowed discord by saying that all Party and League members were rated highly. He encouraged teachers who lived far away to request transfers. He divided the school's Party branch into three "factions," using "rejection, attack, flattery, and pulling" tactics against these "factions" in an attempt to split and defeat the Party branch. He also advocated establishing a school affairs committee as the highest authority in the school, with the power to remove the principal. He also insulted the trade union as the tail of the Party and administration.

    During the "blooming and contending" period, he firmly advocated holding mass meetings. He repeatedly stated publicly that Minjin was already ahead of the Communist Party in the rectification movement and other work. He also said, "Long live the two parties, neither leading the other." He said that because the leadership had conflicts with backward elements, the organizational line of the Caoyang Middle School Minjin branch was to "develop middle elements and unite backward elements." He also distorted the principle of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" as mainly supervising the Communist Party.

    Huang Jinsi's set of anti-Party experiences was once praised by some representatives at the Minjin two-province-one-city experience exchange conference, and was called a typical example of Minjin branch supervision. It also received the support of Lin Handa, vice chairman of the Minjin Central Committee, who came to Shanghai to attend the conference. However, because more representatives disagreed at the meeting, this ugly thing was not passed.

    Recently, a symposium held by the Minjin Shanghai Municipal Committee and all the teachers and staff of Caoyang Middle School exposed many facts about Huang's anti-Communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist activities. Now, Caoyang Middle School is conducting further in-depth criticism of him.

### 黄浚思的反动活动受到林汉达支持  民进上海市委和曹杨中学对他展开斗争

    黄浚思的反动活动受到林汉达支持
    民进上海市委和曹杨中学对他展开斗争
    本报讯　中国民主促进会上海市委、上海市曹杨中学揭露右派分子，民进成员黄浚思。
    黄浚思到曹杨中学工作还不满一年。对工作多方进行破坏。在工资改革工作中，黄浚思挑拨离间地说，凡是党团员都评得高。对一些家住得较远的教师他就鼓励他们要求调校。他把学校的党支部分为三“派”，对这几“派”分别用“拒、打、捧、拉”的手段，企图分裂和打垮党支部。他同时主张建立校务委员会为学校最高职权机构，有权撤换校长。他还辱骂工会是党和行政的尾巴。
    在“鸣”“放”时期，他坚决主张召开群众大会。他一再公开说，在整风运动和其它工作上，民进已经走在共产党的前面了。他还说：“两党万岁，谁也不领导谁”。他说因为领导同落后分子有矛盾，所以曹杨中学民进支部的组织路线为“发展中间分子，团结落后分子”。他并且曲解“长期共存，互相监督”方针为主要是对共产党监督。
    黄浚思的这套反党经验在民进两省一市经验交流会议上，一度受到了某些代表赞赏，被称为是民进支部监督的典型范例，也得到了来上海参加会议的民进中央委员会副主席林汉达的支持。但因会上有更多的代表不同意，没有把这个丑恶的东西通过。
    最近民进上海市委召开的座谈会和曹杨中学的全体教职员工揭露了黄许多反共、反人民、反社会主义的事实，现在，曹杨中学还在对他作进一步的深入批判。
