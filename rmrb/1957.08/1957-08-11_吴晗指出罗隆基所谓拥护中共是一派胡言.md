(Reported by this newspaper) At the sixth enlarged rectification座谈会 of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League held on the afternoon of the 10th, Wu Han, Lü Guangguang, and Liang Sicheng delivered speeches that powerfully exposed Luo Longji's consistently reactionary political nature. Excerpts from their speeches are published below.

    Wu Han points out that Luo Longji's so-called support for the CCP is a pack of lies

    Wu Han said in his speech that Luo Longji has repeatedly quibbled, saying that even if he were burned to ashes, there would be no scent of opposition to the Communist Party, and that he resolutely supported the leadership of the Communist Party. This is truly the height of shamelessness. Now we cite a few ironclad facts to illustrate whether Luo Longji was pro-Communist or anti-Communist?

    In 1948, Luo Longji put forward a political program opposing the leadership of the Communist Party, stating that if the CCP did not accept it, the China Democratic League would withdraw from the coalition government and confront the CCP.

    As early as more than twenty years ago, Luo Longji ferociously clamored that the success of the Chinese Communist Party was "a disaster for China and no blessing for Japan" (New Moon Monthly, Volume 3, Issue 12). Not only did he oppose the Communist Party, but he also offered advice to the enemy of the Chinese people, Japanese imperialism, asking them to join him in opposing the Communist Party. What was Luo Longji's position before and after liberation? In 1948, after the Third Plenary Session of the China Democratic League decided to cooperate with the Communist Party, after the China Democratic League responded to the CCP's May 1st call to participate in the coalition government, and on the eve of the People's Liberation Army destroying Chiang Kai-shek's army with overwhelming force and the imminent liberation of the whole country, Shen Henglao and other comrades of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League had already gone from Hong Kong to the liberated areas. When I was going from Shanghai to the North China liberated area, Luo Longji wanted me to take a letter to Shen Henglao, who had already arrived in the liberated area, asking Shen to represent the China Democratic League and put forward several conditions to the CCP Central Committee. I still remember these conditions clearly. The main points were to advocate not leaning to the Soviet Union unilaterally, but to implement a so-called concord foreign policy; that members of the China Democratic League and members of the CCP should not overlap; that the China Democratic League should have its own political program and sign an agreement with the CCP, and that if the CCP did not accept it, the China Democratic League could withdraw from the coalition government and become an opposition party.

    In 1949, Luo Longji disagreed with the statement that the democratic parties represented the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie, and the CCP represented the proletariat, and told Premier Zhou that "you represent a part of the people, and we represent a part of the people."

    The political program put forward in this letter was drafted entirely by Luo Longji himself. At that time, it was mentioned for discussion among comrades in the China Democratic League in Shanghai, and Shi Liang, Xu Guangping, Chu Tunan, and other comrades all disagreed. However, Luo Longji still wanted me to take it to North China and ask Shen Henglao to put it forward to the CCP. After I arrived in North China, I learned that Shen Henglao and other China Democratic League comrades were in the Northeast liberated area. Luo Longji's proposal was very absurd, so I did not hand over the letter at that time. According to Luo Longji's idea, either the CCP would accept Luo Longji's reactionary bourgeois program, causing China to take the capitalist road, or the China Democratic League would not participate in the government, but would confront the CCP as an opposition party.

    After liberation, how did Luo Longji "resolutely support the Communist Party"? Wu Han said: Before the Political Consultative Conference was convened in 1949, Luo Longji arrived in Beiping, and Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou both met with him. Now someone has revealed that after Luo Longji met with Chairman Mao, he said to his friend: "Chairman Mao is very powerful and cunning, more ferocious than rulers of previous dynasties." When Premier Zhou talked with Luo Longji, Premier Zhou said that the democratic parties represented the national bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie, and the CCP represented the proletariat. Luo expressed disagreement with Premier Zhou's opinion. He said that Zhou was from Nankai, Mao was from Peking University, and he was from Tsinghua. Why could they represent the proletariat and ask him to represent the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie? He said that he had told Premier Zhou that we should form a people's front, you represent a part of the people, and we represent another part of the people, and thus jointly negotiate, cooperate and organize a coalition government. This passage expresses very clearly that he was unwilling to accept the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. He wanted to take turns being the host, take turns governing, and arrogantly proclaimed himself as representing a part of the people and bargaining face to face with the Communist Party.

    From these words, everyone can see what Luo Longji's so-called "resolutely supporting the Communist Party" means.

### 吴晗指出罗隆基所谓拥护中共是一派胡言

    本报讯　在10日下午举行的民盟中央第六次整风扩大座谈会上，吴晗、吕光光、梁思成的发言对罗隆基一贯反动的政治本质作了有力的揭发。现在把他们的发言摘要发表如下。
    吴晗指出罗隆基所谓拥护中共是一派胡言
    吴晗发言说，罗隆基多次狡辩，说什么把他烧成灰，都没有反对共产党的气味，说什么他是坚决拥护共产党领导的，真是无耻到极点。现在我们举几件铁一般事实，来说明罗隆基到底是亲共的还是反共的？
    一九四八年罗隆基就提出一个反对共产党领导的政治纲领，如果中共不接受，他就要民盟退出联合政府和中共对抗
    早在二十多年前罗隆基就凶恶地叫嚣中国共产党的成功，“固为中国之祸，亦非日本之福”（新月月刊第三卷第十二期）。他不但反对共产党，还替中国人民的敌人日本帝国主义献计，要他们和他一起来反对共产党。解放前后罗隆基的立场怎样呢？1948年，这就是在民盟三中全会决定和共产党合作之后，在民盟响应中共五一号召决定参加联合政府之后，在解放军以排山倒海之势消灭蒋介石军队，全国即将解放的前夕，沈衡老和民盟中央其他同志都已从香港到解放区，我在从上海到华北解放区的时候，罗隆基要我带一封信给已到解放区的沈衡老，要沈老代表民盟向中共中央提出几个条件，这些条件我现在还清楚地记得，主要是主张不要向苏联一边倒，实行所谓协和外交政策；民盟盟员与中共党员彼此不要有交叉；民盟要有自己的政治纲领，要和中共订立协议，如果中共不接受，民盟可以退出联合政府，成为在野党。
    一九四九年罗隆基就不同意民主党派代表资产阶级和小资产阶级，中共代表无产阶级的说法，向周总理表示要“你们代表一部分人民，我们代表一部分人民。”
    这封信所提出的政治纲领，全是罗隆基一人起草的，当时曾经提到上海盟内同志讨论，史良、许广平、楚图南，还有其他同志都不同意。但是罗隆基仍然要我带到华北，要沈衡老向中共提出。我到了华北以后，才知道沈衡老和其他民盟同志是在东北解放区。罗隆基这次主张是十分荒谬的，当时我也就没有把这封信交出来。按照罗隆基的意思，要末中共接受罗隆基的反动的资产阶级纲领，使中国走资本主义道路，要末民盟就不参加政府，而以反对党的身份和中共对抗。
    解放以后罗隆基究竟是怎样“坚决拥护共产党”呢？吴晗说：1949年政协会议召开之前，罗隆基到了北平，毛主席和周总理都接见了他。现在有人揭发：罗隆基见毛主席之后就对他的朋友说：“毛主席这个人很厉害狡猾，比历代统治人物都凶。”周总理和罗隆基谈话时，周总理说民主党派代表民族资产阶级和小资产阶级，中共代表无产阶级。罗表示不同意周总理的意见，他说周是南开出身的，毛是北大出身的，我是清华出身的，为什么他们就能代表无产阶级而要我代表资产阶级和小资产阶级呢？他说他曾向周总理表示，我们成立人民阵线，你们代表一部分人民，我们代表另一部分人民，这样来共同协议合作组织联合政府。这一段话十分露骨地表示他是不愿意接受中国共产党领导，他要轮流做庄，轮流执政，而且狂妄地自封为代表一部分人民和共产党面对面讲价钱。
    从这些话大家可以看出罗隆基所说的“坚决拥护共产党”是什么意思了。
