Why Do Rightists Advocate Running "Doujinshi Publishing Houses"?
    Lin Jin

    Since the rectification campaign, rightists have been very active in the publishing world. They have been vigorously advocating running "doujinshi publishing houses," believing that running "doujinshi publishing houses" is a "new direction" for publishing work. But what exactly are these "doujinshi publishing houses" they are talking about? What are their intentions in advocating this?

    Rightist leader Zhang Bojun is a proponent of running "doujinshi publishing houses." At a forum held by the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee on May 8 for responsible persons of various democratic parties, he put forward a concrete plan, advocating "intellectuals organizing publishing cooperatives" and believing that they should be "supported by state loans." He used the Communist Party's policy of "mutual supervision and long-term coexistence" as an excuse, saying that "mutual supervision requires opening up avenues for speech, which requires grounds and places for publication." The secret intentions of Zhang Bojun have now been revealed. It turns out that his conspiracy was to first seize the position of cultural and educational work, and then seize the entire leadership of the Party. He said that opening up avenues for speech requires grounds and places for publication. Is it the case that there are no grounds and places for publication now? What kind of grounds does he want? Our current publishing houses, including the joint state-private ones, are all socialist cultural undertakings and are all led by the state. What does Zhang Bojun mean by advocating "intellectuals organizing publishing cooperatives"? Doesn't he want to free the publishing industry from the leadership of the Party and the state? Obviously, his advocacy of organizing "publishing cooperatives" is not for anything else, but to create favorable conditions for bourgeois rightists so that they can freely publish and disseminate books with anti-Party and anti-socialist ideas in large quantities, in order to incite the masses and achieve the goal of seizing the leadership of the Party.

    The reason why rightists advocate running "doujinshi publishing houses" is that they are dissatisfied with the publishing industry in the new society. They believe that the socialist system is not as good as the capitalist system. Therefore, some people have proposed that the fundamental system must be changed. Xiao Qian is this kind of person. He published an article in Wenhui Bao on May 28 entitled "'People's' Publishing House, Why Has It Become a Government Office?", greatly exaggerating the tone of "the present is not as good as the past." He has infinite nostalgia for the old society and deep hatred for the new society. He reversed black and white, saying that publishing houses are now "indifferent" to writers, while publishing houses in the past were "warm" to writers. He affirmed that it is useless for the current publishing work to only improve shortcomings, and that the fundamental system must be eradicated. What is the fundamental system? Of course, it is the socialist system. The problem is very clear: if it is not the socialist system, it is the capitalist system. He wants to defeat the socialist publishing industry and restore the old road of capitalism.

    The rightists want to defeat the socialist publishing industry, and they are determined to fight. Rightist Zhang Yousong proposed that the "bureaucracy" of publishing work is a "contradiction between ourselves and the enemy." He wants everyone to rise up and "launch a fierce battle against this stubborn enemy" and "completely eliminate" it. He greatly publicized the slogan "Return my agency!" put forward by people with ulterior motives, and asked the relevant parties to carefully "consider" it. In order to fight to the end, he has proposed to "hold our heads high, stand tall, and enter the battle." Can we imagine that such remarks are for the sake of rectification?

    It is very obvious that the "doujinshi publishing houses" advocated by the rightists want to restore the capitalist system. Xu Junyuan, who once served as the deputy editor-in-chief of the Chongqing Kuomintang Central Daily News, advocated "doujinshi publishing houses" which are capitalist publishing houses. During the rectification campaign, he instigated booksellers to restore their businesses, and he planned to restore the Silian, Chunming, Guoguang, and Wenyu publishing houses, which had been merged into the Cultural Publishing House, to private ownership, calling them "doujinshi publishing houses." He himself was preparing to set up a "doujinshi publishing house." We are not very clear about how to do it, but in the list of more than 20 "fellows" he drafted, there was not a single Party member or League member. He said: "It will not be easy to do if there is a Party member leading it." Feng Yidai, a rightist from the Foreign Languages ​​Press, also wanted to set up a "doujinshi publishing house." This is the "doujinshi publishing house" advocated by the rightists.

    Rightist Zeng Yansiu also actively advocated running "doujinshi publishing houses." He said at a forum convened by the People's Daily on April 24: there are "few people willing to do it now, but it can be advocated." Why did Zeng Yansiu also advocate "doujinshi publishing houses"? It turns out that he is also extremely dissatisfied with the socialist publishing industry. He said that publishing work has no direction, that publishing houses now restrict thought, that academic works have basically stopped, and that all that is being published are dogmatic pamphlets... in short, it is completely bad. Obviously, these are all slanders. After scolding the Party's publishing industry as worthless, he advocated what "doujinshi publishing houses," obviously wanting to abolish the Party and the state's leadership of publishing work. He believes that the Publishing Bureau of the Ministry of Culture is useless. He once arrogantly said: "If this bureau is cut off, China will not perish." Isn't the rhetoric of the so-called "doujinshi publishing houses" without the leadership of the Party and the state similar to that of Zhang Bojun?

    Lan Yu and Zeng Yansiu sang in harmony. In advocating running "doujinshi publishing houses," Lan Yu went even further than Zeng Yansiu. Lan Yu even bluntly proposed restoring private publishing houses. He attempted to use capitalist free competition to squeeze out the socialist publishing industry. Lan Yu is also extremely dissatisfied with the current socialist publishing industry. He completely negated the entire arrangement of the current publishing industry. He even put forward the slogan of "fundamental change." His method of "fundamental change" is to open up a free market and restore private publishing houses. Moreover, he also advocated abolishing the Publishing Bureau of the Ministry of Culture in order to abolish the state's leadership of publishing work. Isn't this a very obvious capitalist road?

    The rightists advocate running "doujinshi publishing houses," and they think they have reason to do so. Their reason is that there is no "freedom" in current publishing, and they are trying to fight for "freedom." But we know that "freedom" has class character. The "freedom" of the bourgeoisie is only the freedom of a few, and the broad masses of working people have no freedom. We cherish socialist freedom, and socialist freedom is true freedom. Our country's constitution stipulates that every Chinese citizen has freedom of speech and publication, and our country also uses material strength to guarantee this freedom. However, freedom that opposes socialism and undermines the socialist cause is absolutely not allowed. The rightists want to change the socialist system of the publishing industry and advocate running "doujinshi publishing houses" in a big way, in an attempt to restore capitalist "freedom." We must never believe that the "doujinshi publishing houses" advocated by the rightists are for the purpose of improving work and running the socialist publishing industry well. No. They are for the purpose of seizing the socialist ideological front and carrying out capitalist restoration.

    右派分子为什么提倡办“同人出版社”
    林今
    整风以来，右派分子在出版界大肆活跃。他们极力提倡办“同人出版社”，认为办“同人出版社”是出版工作的“新方向”。但是他们所说的“同人出版社”究竟是什么东西呢？他们这样提倡的用意是什么呢？
    右派首领章伯钧，他是提倡办
  “同人出版社”的。在5月8日中央统战部召开各民主党派负责人的座谈会上，他就提出了具体方案，主张“知识分子组织出版合作社”，并且认为应该“由国家贷款来扶持”。他以共产党提出“互相监督，长期共存”的方针为借口，说“互相监督要广开言论之路，这就要有园地、要有地方出版”。章伯钧的葫芦里卖的什么药，现在已经揭开了。原来他的阴谋是先夺取文教工作的阵地，之后夺取党的整个领导权。他说广开言论之路，要有园地，要有地方出版，难道现在就没有园地，没有地方出版么？他所要的园地是什么园地呢？我们现在的出版社包括公私合营的出版社在内，都是社会主义的文化事业，都是由国家来领导的。章伯钧提倡
  “知识分子组织出版合作社”是什么意思呢？难道不是想把出版事业摆脱党和国家的领导吗？显然，他提倡组织“出版合作社”，不是为着别的，而是为着给资产阶级右派创造一种有利条件，使右派能够无拘无束地大量出版散播反党反社会主义思想的书籍，以便煽惑群众，达到夺取党的领导的目的。
    右派分子提倡办“同人出版社”，就是由于他们对新社会的出版事业不满。他们认为，社会主义制度不如资本主义制度。因而，有一些人就提出了必须改变根本制度的主张。萧乾就是这种人。他在5月28日文汇报上发表“‘人民’的出版社为什么会成了衙门”一文，大弹“今不如昔”的论调。他对旧社会无限留恋，对新社会却深恶痛绝。他颠倒黑白，说现在出版社对作家如何“冷漠”，过去的出版社对作家如何“温暖”。他肯定现在的出版工作只改进缺点是不济于事的，必须铲除根本制度才行。什么是根本制度呢？当然是社会主义制度。问题很清楚，不是社会主义制度，就是资本主义制度。他要打垮社会主义的出版事业，而恢复资本主义的老路。
    右派想打垮社会主义的出版事业，他们是要作坚决斗争的。右派分子张友松就提出出版工作的“官僚主义”是“敌我矛盾”，他要大家起来“向这个顽强的敌人展开猛烈的战斗”，把它“彻底消灭”。他对别有用心的人提出的“还我社来”的口号大大加以宣扬，并要求有关方面仔细“考虑”。为了斗争到底，他已经提出要“昂起头、挺起胸来，投入战斗”了。我们难道可以设想，像这样的言论，是为着整风么？
    右派分子所提倡的“同人出版社”，就是想恢复资本主义制度，这是很明显的。曾任重庆国民党中央日报副总编辑的许君远，他所提倡的“同人出版社”，就是资本主义的出版社。在整风期间，他曾鼓动书商复辟，他并策划将已经合并于文化出版社的四联、春明、国光、文娱等出版社恢复为私营，名之为
  “同人出版社”。他自己准备搞一个“同人出版社”。如何搞法，我们不大清楚，但他拟定包括二十多“同人”的名单中，却没有一个党员和团员。他说：“有了党员领导，就不好搞了。”外文出版社的右派分子冯亦代也想搞“同人出版社”。这就是右派分子所提倡的
  “同人出版社”。
    右派分子曾彦修，他也积极主张办“同人出版社”。他在4月24日人民日报召开的座谈会上就说：同人出版社“目前愿搞的人很少，但可以提倡”。曾彦修为什么也提倡“同人出版社”呢？原来他对社会主义的出版事业也有极大的不满。他说出版工作没有方针，现在出版社束缚思想，基本上停止了学术著作，尽出些教条主义的小册子……总之坏透了。显然，这都是污蔑。在把党的出版事业骂得一钱不值之后，他提倡什么“同人出版社”，显然就是想取消党和国家对出版工作的领导。他认为现在文化部出版局没有什么用，他曾经狂妄地说：
  “把这个局砍掉，中国不会亡”。没有党和国家领导的所谓“同人出版社”，其论调不正是和章伯钧异曲同工吗？
    蓝钰和曾彦修是一唱一和的。在提倡办“同人出版社”这一点上，蓝钰比曾彦修有过之而无不及。蓝钰甚至直截了当地提出恢复私营出版社的主张。他企图用资本主义自由竞争来挤垮社会主义出版事业。蓝钰对现在社会主义的出版事业，也是极大不满的。他对现在整个出版事业的安排，全盘否定。他竟然也提出“根本改变”的口号来了。他的“根本改变”的方法是开放自由市场，恢复私营出版社。并且，他还主张取消文化部的出版局，以图取消国家对出版工作的领导。难道这不是很明显的资本主义道路么？
    右派分子提倡办“同人出版社”，他们认为自己是有理由的。他们的理由就是说现在的出版没有“自由”，他们是为着争取“自由”的。但是我们知道，“自由”是有阶级性的。资产阶级所谓“自由”，只是少数人的自由，广大的劳苦群众是没有自由的。我们珍视社会主义的自由，社会主义自由才是真正的自由。我们国家的宪法规定每个中国公民都有言论出版的自由，我们的国家还用物质的力量保障这种自由。但是对于反对社会主义、破坏社会主义事业的自由，是绝对不能容许的。右派分子要改变出版事业的社会主义制度，提倡大办“同人出版社”，就是企图恢复资本主义的“自由”。我们决不可以相信右派分子所提倡的“同人出版社”，是为着改进工作，是为着办好社会主义的出版事业。不是的。他们是为着夺取社会主义的思想阵地，进行资本主义的复辟。
