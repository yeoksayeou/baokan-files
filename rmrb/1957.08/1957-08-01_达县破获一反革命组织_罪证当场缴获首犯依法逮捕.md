    Da County Smashes a Counter-Revolutionary Organization
    Incriminating Evidence Seized on the Spot; Chief Culprit Arrested According to Law
    (Our report) The public security organs in Da County, Sichuan, cracked down on the "Dao'er Cult" counter-revolutionary organization at the end of June, seizing on the spot six homemade rifles, knives, spears, sacrificial flags, and other evidence of their crimes used for the planned riot. The riot ringleader, Gan Zairong, and core members Yao Ziwen, Gan Zhengda, and Wang Zongxiao, were arrested according to law.
    As early as January, the Dao'er Cult ringleader, Gan Zairong, and others actively developed their counter-revolutionary organization, spreading rumors and inciting the masses. In February, when the people of Da County were striving for a bumper harvest in agriculture and building a reservoir in Huangting Township, the Gan gang and others took advantage of the government's shortcomings, such as using some farmers' land in the construction of the reservoir and insufficient explanation to the masses, to put forward reactionary slogans such as opposing the construction of the reservoir and opposing the state monopoly of purchase and marketing, inciting the masses, and threatening backward masses with the killing of their entire families if they did not participate. When they planned the riot, they planned to first destroy the reservoir, kill people and seize guns, then attack the district and township governments, rob banks and warehouses, and then attack Liangping Da County, proposing to first kill party members and league members, and then kill the commune directors and all hateful people, and elected Gan as the "president" of the riot. After learning about this, the government strengthened its leadership over agricultural production and reservoir construction, took the initiative to solve the problems existing in the work, and raised the political consciousness of the masses. At the same time, it took preventive measures, so the bandits' two conspiracies to riot ultimately failed.

    达县破获一反革命组织
    罪证当场缴获首犯依法逮捕
    本报讯　四川达县公安机关，6月底破获阴谋暴乱的“刀儿教”反革命组织，当场缴获暴乱用的土枪六支，刀矛祭旗等罪证，依法逮捕了暴乱匪首甘在荣和匪骨干姚子文、甘正大、王宗孝等人。
    早在1月间，刀儿教匪首甘在荣等就积极发展反革命组织，造谣煽惑群众。2月间，达县人民为争取农业丰收，修建黄廷乡的水库，甘匪等利用政府在修建水库中使用了部分农民耕地，向群众宣传解释不够等缺点，提出反对修水库、反对统购统销等反动口号，煽动群众，并且以不参加就要杀全家来恐吓落后群众。他们计划暴乱时，先破水库、杀人夺枪，再打区乡政府，抢银行、仓库，然后攻打梁平达县，提出先杀党员、团员，再杀社主任及一切可恨的人，并选甘匪为暴乱总统。政府获悉后，一面加强对农业生产和修建水库的领导，主动解决工作中存在的问题，提高群众的政治觉悟；一面采取预防措施，因而匪徒两次阴谋暴乱终归失败。
