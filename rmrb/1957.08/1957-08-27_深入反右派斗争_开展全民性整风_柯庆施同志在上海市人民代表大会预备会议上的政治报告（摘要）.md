To deepen the anti-Rightist struggle and launch a nationwide rectification campaign.
Comrade Ke Qingshi's political report at the preparatory meeting of the Shanghai Municipal People's Congress (excerpts).
Our country has achieved great successes in socialist transformation and socialist construction, and we will make even greater efforts to complete this task.

Facts over the past six months have proven that the socialist revolution on the economic front alone in 1956, that is, in the ownership of the means of production, is not enough. There must be a thorough socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. The rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle are this kind of revolution. This is a great struggle. If we don't win this battle, there is no hope for socialism. We must deepen the anti-Rightist struggle, launch a nationwide rectification campaign, and carry out this revolution to the end until we achieve a complete and total victory. The anti-Rightist struggle is a struggle that concerns the survival of the nation and has great historical and global significance.

I would like to discuss four issues for the representatives to consider: First, the situation of the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle in Shanghai; Second, the nature of the bourgeois Rightists and the significance of the anti-Rightist struggle; Third, everyone must have a clear-cut stand in the anti-Rightist struggle; Fourth, launch a nationwide great debate and carry out a nationwide rectification campaign.

I. The Situation of the Rectification Campaign and the Anti-Rightist Struggle in Shanghai

1956 was the year when our country achieved a decisive victory in the socialist revolution. This great victory brought about fundamental changes in the ownership of the means of production in our country, which could not but be reflected in people's consciousness.

Based on this situation, over the past year or so, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have put forward a series of policies, the general theme of which is the correct handling of contradictions among the people, so as to resolve our own problems within the people through promoting democracy and using persuasion rather than coercion, and to encourage everyone's enthusiasm for building socialism. In April of this year, it was decided to launch a rectification movement so that, through rectification, the Party's work could better adapt to the new situation, unite all forces that can be united, and serve the construction of socialism.

The great airing of views in Shanghai began shortly after the National Propaganda Conference, when the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a forum of representatives from intellectual circles. On May 12, the Municipal Committee convened a propaganda conference, announcing the start of the Shanghai Party organization's rectification, and the airing of views reached a climax. This process is familiar to all of us, so I won't go into detail today.

I just want to reiterate that we have always held a sincere attitude and welcome people from all walks of life to help our Party carry out rectification. Our Party's work has indeed achieved great successes, but in specific work, there are indeed some shortcomings and errors. Our Party has never been intoxicated by such great achievements and neglected even individual shortcomings or minor errors. Therefore, in the eight years since the victory of the Liberation War, our Party has repeatedly conducted struggles within the entire Party to overcome shortcomings, correct errors, rectify work styles, and improve ideological levels. We fully know that this is not only a matter for our Party but also concerns the future of our country. The people of Shanghai, like the people of the whole country, support the Party's rectification movement out of a desire to protect the Party and socialism. In the great airing of views, most of the criticisms were well-intentioned (although some were not entirely correct), and we once again thank them and welcome them to continue helping us with rectification.

As everyone has also seen, the bourgeois Rightists took advantage of the rectification campaign, mixed in with those who were sincerely and well-intentioned in helping the Party with rectification, and launched a frenzied attack on the Party.

As everyone knows, Rightist elements have existed in Shanghai for a long time. They have engaged in sabotage activities during previous political movements and major political events. They also stirred up trouble around the time of the Hungarian incident last year. Because we carried out education among the broad masses to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves and to distinguish between right and wrong, their conspiracy did not succeed. This time, especially around the time of the Municipal Committee's propaganda work conference, they made a wrong assessment of the overall situation. They saw the greater unity and strength of the socialist camp after the 20th Congress of the CPSU and the Hungarian incident as a weakening of the camp's strength. They regarded the absolute advantage of the proletariat in our country as an absolute disadvantage. They underestimated the level of awareness of the workers and peasants, underestimated the improvement of socialist understanding and the possibility of accepting socialist transformation among the majority of intellectuals and industrialists and businesspeople, and also underestimated the improvement of understanding and the possibility of accepting transformation among the majority of members of the democratic parties. They thought that "the whole situation is leaning to one side" and "the Communist Party is failing," and that as long as they lit the fire, the Communist Party would be finished. Therefore, they ignored all advice and spread vicious anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist remarks everywhere, and went to various organs, organizations, factories, and schools to set fires. It was truly a sudden storm, and the evil spirit soared to the sky. Even the "crows" were calling. They launched a major offensive against the Communist Party and the socialist system with a program, organization, and plan. They were blinded by greed and went to extremes.

Everyone can see that this great battle was provoked by the Rightists. We were sincerely carrying out rectification, sincerely welcoming criticisms from all walks of life, while the Rightists launched a vicious attack. Seeing the inevitability of this class struggle, we let them fully air their views, let the poisonous weeds grow tall and lush, so that after the people saw them clearly, everyone could take action to fight against the poisonous weeds. Until the beginning of June, the people, especially the workers, had reached the end of their patience and launched a counterattack against the Rightists, forming a massive anti-Rightist struggle.

What stage has it developed to now?

The current struggle is deepening. The consciousness of the workers, peasants, young students, revolutionary intellectuals, and industrialists and businesspeople who support socialism has been greatly raised, and hundreds of thousands of people have actively joined the struggle. Rightist elements have been successively exposed in batches. The reactionary remarks and conspiracies of the Rightist elements are being thoroughly exposed and criticized. They have fallen into a passive and isolated position. Some have bowed their heads and confessed their crimes, while others are still stubbornly resisting. The general situation is that after more than two months of the anti-Rightist struggle, we have achieved a decisive victory. However, we must deepen the struggle, carry it through to the end, and strive for a complete victory.

While the anti-Rightist struggle is being carried out victoriously, the Party's rectification is still continuing. According to the principle of rectifying while correcting, various organs are studying criticisms and suggestions from all aspects, classifying them. Anything that can be done immediately will be done immediately. For anything that involves many aspects and needs to be studied with relevant parties, improvement plans will also be drafted. Anything that cannot be done or cannot be done temporarily will be explained. Even if it is not a Rightist statement but is indeed wrong, it should be given well-intentioned criticism. Now, some departments have improved better, some have improved worse, and a few departments have done very poorly. We are urging them to continue to improve, rectify while correcting, and never stop.

Our goal is to create a political situation that is both centralized and democratic, both disciplined and free, both unified in will and allows individuals to be happy and lively, so as to facilitate the socialist revolution and socialist construction, make it easier to overcome difficulties, build our country's modern industry and modern agriculture faster, and make the Party and the country more consolidated and more able to withstand risks. This is the conclusion our Party has drawn from summarizing many historical experiences. Our Party's proposal to correctly handle contradictions among the people is to create this kind of political situation. This is the general direction of our country's political life. Therefore, the general policy of correctly handling contradictions among the people, the policies of letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend, long-term coexistence, mutual supervision, etc., must and will continue to be implemented and will never be abandoned halfway because of the anti-Rightist struggle. The anti-Rightist struggle is precisely creating conditions for creating this kind of political situation, because we have no common language with the bourgeois Rightists. Without winning the anti-Rightist struggle, this kind of political situation cannot be created. Therefore, it is groundless to suspect that rectification will no longer be carried out and that airing of views will no longer be allowed.

II. The Nature of the Bourgeois Rightists and the Significance of the Anti-Rightist Struggle

Regarding the nature of the bourgeois Rightists, the People's Daily editorial on July 1 stated: "The bourgeois Rightists are the anti-Communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist bourgeois reactionaries mentioned earlier. This is a scientific and realistic explanation." The editorial said: "This is a small handful of people. They exist among the democratic parties, intellectuals, capitalists, and young students. They also exist within the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League. They have shown themselves in this great storm. Their numbers are extremely small, but they have power in the democratic parties, especially in certain democratic parties, which cannot be underestimated. These people not only have words but also actions. They are guilty. 'Speakers are not guilty' does not apply to them. They are not only speakers but also actors. Should they be punished? It seems unnecessary now, because the people's state is very consolidated, and many of them are leading figures. We can be generous and not punish them. In general, 'Rightist elements' will suffice. There is no need to call them reactionaries, except in one case, which is when they repeatedly refuse to change and continue to engage in sabotage activities, violating criminal law. Then they must be punished. The principles of learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones, curing diseases to save people, and transforming negative factors into positive factors still apply to them. There is another type of Rightist who has words but no actions. Their words are similar to those of the Rightists mentioned above, but they have no destructive actions. We should be even more lenient to these people. Wrong statements must be thoroughly criticized. This cannot be done leniently, but they should be allowed to retain their own opinions. All of the above types of people are still allowed to have freedom of speech. A great and consolidated country will not be harmed by keeping such a small group of people after the broad masses have understood their mistakes." Doing so will be more beneficial to the proletarian revolutionary cause in the long run.

After several months of exposure and criticism, more and more materials have proven that this attack by the bourgeois Rightists was a frenzied attack with a program, organization, and plan.

In this frenzied attack, they attacked our Five Great Movements and Three Great Transformations, fundamentally denying the achievements of our socialist transformation and socialist construction. Anyone who said that achievements were the main aspect and shortcomings were the secondary aspect was sentenced to the great crime of "dogmatism" and "covering up errors," and some were even slandered as so-called "counter-revolutionaries" by them. They attacked the socialist political and economic systems, falsely accusing our socialist system as the root cause of all mistakes. They attacked the leadership of the Communist Party, demanding that the Communist Party withdraw from schools, factories, newspapers, courts, science, literature, and all other units, and replace the leadership of the Communist Party with things like "political design institutes" and "rehabilitation committees." They attacked the dictatorship of the proletariat, attacked democratic centralism, attacked our country's foreign policy, opposed the Soviet Union, and opposed the unity of socialist countries. In short, they opposed socialism and opposed the leadership of the Communist Party. What they wanted was the capitalist road, leadership by their bourgeois Rightists, and the restoration of the landlords and bourgeoisie. They not only used the above items as their reactionary program but also, led by the Zhang-Luo alliance and including some other Rightist careerists, carried out organized and planned sabotage activities throughout the country. The large amount of facts that the people of Shanghai have exposed fully proves that their activities in Shanghai were all carried out according to their reactionary program. All of this shows that they have openly violated the Constitution, which they raised their hands to pass with us. They have openly stood in a position of resisting the socialist revolution and being hostile to and undermining socialist construction.

After these months of great debate, they have been left speechless. Some people have made confessions and bowed their heads in admitting their crimes, which we welcome. But there are still some people who are not convinced, unwilling to make thorough confessions. Even more, some Rightist elements, under the pursuit of the people, have been defeated and changed their tune, as if their mistakes were only ideological problems, not political problems; as if they never opposed the Communist Party or socialism, but instead supported the Communist Party and socialism. They claim that their "motives were good, but the effects were bad." This is completely deceptive. We may as well list some of the Rightists' arguments for analysis.

For example: The assessment of achievements. In ordinary times, we are unwilling to keep "achievements are the main aspect" on our lips and be self-intoxicated. We always admonish ourselves not to be carried away by victory and to implement the policy of being modest and prudent, and guarding against arrogance and rashness. This time, why do we have to emphasize that achievements are the main aspect? This is because the Rightists fundamentally deny that there are any achievements. Why do they so firmly deny achievements? On the one hand, due to different positions, there are also different views on what constitutes achievements and shortcomings. The liberation of China is regarded by us Chinese people as a great achievement of countless martyrs shedding blood and sacrificing themselves and hundreds of millions of people fighting heroically for a hundred years. Imperialists, Chiang Kai-shek, and the bourgeois Rightists regard it as a great mistake. The victory of the Five Great Movements and the Three Great Transformations is regarded by those who support socialism as a great achievement of the socialist revolution, while the anti-socialist Rightist elements regard it as a "complete mess." There is nothing strange about this. On the other hand, they deny achievements, exaggerating individual and local shortcomings or errors as fundamental and comprehensive errors, in order to fundamentally deny the correctness of our eight years of revolution and construction, thereby fundamentally denying the correctness of the basic path of socialist revolution and socialist construction, and in order to incite those who have unclear understanding and wavering positions to break away from the leadership of the Party, leave the socialist road, and follow them on the capitalist road.

We have never said that we have no shortcomings and errors. In Chinese history, no other class or political party has been able to solicit criticism from the masses on a national scale like the proletariat and the Communist Party. This is because we know that our shortcomings and errors are shortcomings and errors in the process of advancement and can be overcome. Take bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism as examples. We are fundamentally different from the reactionary rulers of the landlords and bourgeoisie. The Communist Party represents the fundamental interests of the people, while the reactionary rulers of the landlords and bourgeoisie fundamentally oppose the people. They are experts at exploiting the working people. These are two essentially different situations. Therefore, the reactionary rule of the landlords and bourgeoisie is a hotbed for the generation of bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism. They fundamentally do not want to overcome these three isms and cannot overcome them. The Communist Party, on the other hand, takes serving the people as its purpose, and all our Party members and cadres (except for a few individuals) work diligently for the people. Their bureaucratic style is contagious from the old society. The Communist Party fundamentally opposes bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism, and relies on the supervision of the masses and the improvement of the level of Marxist ideology to gradually overcome them. However, the bourgeois Rightists exaggerate our shortcomings to uglify the Communist Party and the socialist system. This is two different attitudes and two different purposes from our pointing out shortcomings and errors. We do it to overcome and correct them, while the bourgeois Rightists do it to oppose the Communist Party and socialism.

For example: Regarding the leadership of the Party. Without the leadership of the Party, there would be no new China. Since the bourgeois democratic revolution must be led by the Communist Party to achieve complete victory, would it not be strange if the socialist revolution and socialist construction could succeed without the leadership of the Communist Party? The leading position of the Communist Party is not self-proclaimed. It is the inevitable result of historical development and the result of the Chinese people's choice from countless lessons of bloodshed and sacrifice. Therefore, among the Rightist elements, a few of the most insane elements shouted for the Communist Party to step down and to kill the Communist Party. A small portion of them even did so. However, their actions were quickly seen through by the masses, and their reactionary faces were immediately exposed to the world. Those with political experience among the Rightist elements, mainly those who have received long-term training from the bourgeoisie and have experience in political struggle with the proletariat, have adopted a more circuitous offensive strategy. They understand that calling for the Communist Party to step down is too revealing. They started from the local level, saying that the Communist Party's leadership is not working this way or that way, saying that the Communist Party should withdraw from this department and that department. They thought that the cultural and educational circles would easily listen to them, so they wanted to open a gap here first, and then gradually push it out, with the aim of taking the Communist Party's leading position and replacing it. They understand that political leadership and organizational leadership are inseparable, but some people do not understand this point. Therefore, the Rightist elements incited the masses, saying that the Communist Party only needs political leadership, not organizational leadership; it is not necessary for Communist Party members to work in various organs, and it is not necessary to have public representatives in joint state-private enterprises, and schools do not need the leadership of the Party committee, and the use of cadres should not have political standards, etc., otherwise it is sectarianism and "Party world." In fact, the Communist Party has always advocated and implemented a policy of cooperation with non-Party members. We do not want a pure color, and in fact, it is not a "pure color." Take the Shanghai Municipal People's Congress, the local state power organ, for example. Among the 790 municipal people's representatives, only 326 are Communist Party members, which is less than half. In any unit, Communist Party members are a minority. Without the active efforts of non-Party cadres, our work would be difficult to win. The Rightist elements' attack on "Party world" has no factual basis. The "Party world" they attack is actually the new China of the people led by the proletariat (through the Communist Party). American news agencies and newspapers call liberated China Communist China, which is exactly the same as the Rightist elements saying that China is a "Party world." Another vicious conspiracy of the Rightist elements to oppose the Communist Party is to oppose grassroots cadres. They say that grassroots cadres are terrible and must be thoroughly opposed. Their purpose in slandering grassroots cadres who diligently serve the broad masses of the people is to "draw firewood from under the pot" and shake the Party's leadership from the foundation. At the same time, it also reflects their deep-seated hatred for grassroots cadres who are most familiar with them and with whom they often have face-to-face struggles. There is not much profound reason in this. Just ask the workers, and they can simply tell us what it would be like without a public representative, because they have experience both with and without a public representative. The same is true for institutions of higher learning. Does canceling the leadership of the Party committee with "professors governing the school" strengthen leadership or weaken it? It is easy to draw a conclusion by seriously comparing the situation before liberation with today. As for not identifying and using people with political standards, this is a fundamentally non-existent fantasy in the world. As long as there are classes, there will be their respective standards for using people. Eisenhower would never use a Communist Party member as his chief of staff, nor would he use American progressives as secretary of state. The Rightist elements themselves also use people with political standards. Before they came to power, they had already decided not to have Communist Party members or "bridgeheads," that is, activists. If they really came to power, would they change this view? Their set of arguments, as well as what they call "overqualified," "underqualified," "virtuous but not talented," "talented but not virtuous," etc., are nothing more than to cover up their conspiracy to cancel the leadership of the Communist Party and implement the restoration of the bourgeois Rightists. We Chinese people have lived under the reactionary rule of the landlords and bourgeoisie for a long time, and we have a deep understanding of what their talent and virtue are all about.

For example: Regarding centralization and democracy, discipline and freedom. The bourgeois Rightists incited the masses, saying that under the socialist system and the leadership of the Communist Party, there is only centralization and discipline, no democracy and freedom, while under the capitalist system and the leadership of their bourgeois Rightists, this situation will be fundamentally changed. Chairman Mao has scientifically demonstrated this issue in his speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." Chairman Mao pointed out: "In fact, there is only concrete freedom and concrete democracy in the world, no abstract freedom and abstract democracy. In a class-struggle society, if there is freedom for exploiting classes to exploit working people, there is no freedom for working people not to be exploited. If there is bourgeois democracy, there is no democracy for the proletariat and the working masses." "Among the people, there cannot be no freedom, nor can there be no discipline; There cannot be no democracy, nor can there be no centralization. This unity of democracy and centralization, the unity of freedom and discipline, is our democratic centralism. Under this system, the people enjoy extensive democracy and freedom; at the same time, they must restrain themselves with socialist discipline. The broad masses of the people understand these truths." Why do the people understand? Because the people have lived under the reactionary rule where there is no democracy and freedom for the people, only democracy and freedom for the reactionaries for a long time. Isn't it the same in capitalist factories and in the countryside ruled by the landlord class? At the same time, in the process of fighting against reactionary rule, we also deeply understand that only democratic centralism can guarantee our victory. When building our country, in order to safeguard the greatest interests of the people and for the sake of socialism, is it possible to only want democracy and freedom and not want centralization and discipline? That is fundamentally impossible. The Rightist elements said that the working people have a low level of knowledge and do not understand democracy and freedom. This is nonsense. The working people have sacrificed the most and contributed the most in the struggle for the democracy and freedom of the motherland. Is this a manifestation of a low level of knowledge? The kind of democracy and freedom that the bourgeoisie talks about does not exist at all. In capitalist society, there is only freedom to serve the bourgeoisie, not freedom to serve workers, peasants, and soldiers. The progressive activities of any thinker, artist, or scientist cannot but be suppressed by the bourgeoisie. Only under the socialist system do they have the freedom to serve the working people. Under these conditions, not wanting centralization, not wanting discipline, and only wanting "absolute democracy" and "absolute freedom" can only lead to anarchism and only benefit the bourgeoisie and not the proletariat. Only by correctly implementing democratic centralism can we ensure the creation of a political situation that is both centralized and democratic, both disciplined and free, both unified in will and allows individuals to be happy and lively. This is a situation that no exploiting class can achieve.

For example: Learning from the Soviet Union. In order to build a great socialist country, the experience of the Soviet Union is undoubtedly important to us. It is precisely because of the experience of the Soviet Union (successful and erroneous) that we have taken fewer detours. Our policy is to combine foreign experience with the specific conditions of our country, but when we have not yet gone through practice, choosing foreign experience is not easy, and combining it well is even more difficult, requiring time and cost. We can only strive to shorten the time and pay less cost. Dogmatism is harmful and must be overcome, but it is even more harmful to oppose the universal truth of Marxism and the advanced experience of the Soviet Union as "dogma." The reason why the bourgeois Rightist elements oppose "dogmatism" and oppose learning from the Soviet Union is not really to oppose dogmatism, but to carry out anti-Communist and anti-Soviet activities from a reactionary standpoint of hating the Soviet Union, hating Marxism, and hating socialism. It is even more obvious just by looking at how much they hate our foreign policy.

The examples we have cited above, as well as other countless examples, all show that the words and actions of the bourgeois Rightist elements are not general ideological understanding issues, but political issues; not general political issues, but a fierce class struggle. This is a fundamental issue concerning the survival of the country. If their conspiracy succeeds, it will be the restoration of capitalism, the return to the slave status of a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country, and the beheading of millions of people. In order to realize the great ideal of socialism in China, we Chinese people have already paid a heavy price, and we must never ruin the victory we have already achieved in the hands of this group of Rightist careerists. The significance of the anti-Rightist struggle must never be underestimated, and we must never adopt a sentimental approach. Without winning this struggle, there is no hope for socialism. We must carry out this struggle to a complete victory.

III. In the Anti-Rightist Struggle, Everyone Must Have a Clear-Cut Stand

The socialist road is the most correct road that the Chinese people have found in the past hundred years. The ever-changing face of the motherland since liberation has confirmed this truth. The anti-Rightist struggle is a struggle to defend the socialist road. This struggle is related to the socialist future of our motherland and the survival of the motherland. This struggle has become a personal matter for everyone. Furthermore, the socialist revolution is an unprecedented and most profound revolution in history. It cannot but touch the depths of everyone's thoughts. Everyone cannot but determine their attitude towards this revolution, especially when the bourgeois Rightists launch a frenzied attack to resist and undermine the socialist revolution and socialist construction. Everyone cannot but have a clear-cut stand, that is, to take the socialist road led by the proletariat, or the capitalist road led by the bourgeois Rightists. It is impossible to find a middle road on this issue. Whoever tries to take a middle road, no matter what their subjective intentions are, cannot but help the Rightists.

The great storms of the past few months have indeed tested everyone. First of all, the Rightists were exposed. As mentioned earlier, the Rightists in Shanghai have existed for a long time, and this time they were exposed more thoroughly. Among them, there are mainly these three types of people: One type is the right wing of the democratic parties during the original democratic revolution. They have always represented the position of the bourgeois right wing, have more experience in political struggle, and have disguises such as "democratic professors" and "progressive people," which have a deceptive effect on some of the masses. This time they played a leading role and organized the attack. Another type is the former power-holders, the figures on the stage during the Kuomintang period. They have a notorious reputation and are unwilling to withdraw from the historical stage. They did not dare to show their faces in ordinary times, but this time they thought that the world had changed drastically, and they all came out. There is also a type of people who have always been politically dissatisfied, as well as other bourgeois elements who resist the socialist revolution. These types of people exist objectively and will always emerge when there is an opportunity. This great exposure is not surprising, and it is a good thing.

However, the Rightists are still a minority. This great storm proves that the Party Central Committee's proposal to correctly handle contradictions among the people, openly carry out rectification, and greatly air views is completely correct. We must firmly trust the masses. The majority of the people, especially the majority of the basic masses of workers and peasants, can be trusted. Even the majority of industrialists and businesspeople and intellectuals have proven through this test to be more good people than bad. The majority of them have a tendency to accept the leadership of the proletariat and accept socialist transformation, although the degree of each person is different. After this anti-Rightist struggle, they have universally received a profound socialist education, which is beneficial for them to abandon their original positions and move a big step closer to the working class.

Everyone should seize this precious opportunity, strive to transform themselves, and pass this socialist "test" well. This "test" is something that everyone must pass, and cannot avoid passing, because the socialist revolution touches everyone. However, many people are not mentally prepared to participate in this revolution. This revolution happened suddenly for them. There are also such people among Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members. Therefore, it is not surprising that some people were temporarily at a loss or wavered during the great airing of views. We hope that they will accept their respective lessons, just like getting a vaccination, increase their resistance, and on this basis, strive to overcome their shortcomings, transform themselves, and determine their own clear-cut working-class stand. It should be seen that transforming one's old position, old views, and old work styles is a glorious thing. As long as one is not attached to the past, one should not have feelings of inferiority. Of course, ideological transformation cannot be completely completed in a day or two, but in the anti-Rightist struggle, everyone's political awareness can be improved much faster than usual. We hope that, at present, they will first distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, stand firm, distinguish between right and wrong, abandon a wait-and-see attitude, abandon sentimentalism, and actively participate in the anti-Rightist struggle to lay a more solid foundation for their future thorough transformation. Especially intellectuals from the old society should see the necessity of self-transformation, recognize that there is no one to serve other than serving the workers, peasants, and working people. Therefore, we hope that they will more consciously transform themselves and integrate with the working people.

IV. Launch a Nationwide Great Debate and Carry Out a Nationwide Rectification Campaign

This rectification campaign and anti-Rightist struggle is an open, nationwide great debate. The topic of the debate is whether our revolutionary and construction work is correct (whether the achievements of revolution and construction are the main aspect), whether we should take the socialist road, whether the leadership of the Communist Party is necessary, whether the dictatorship of the proletariat is necessary, whether democratic centralism is necessary, and whether our country's foreign policy is correct, and other major issues. This great debate is also a socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. Through this great debate, we will rectify the work style of the Communist Party and carry out socialist transformation of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie.

This great debate is very necessary and must happen. During the democratic revolution, there was a great debate. From the Kang-Liang Reform, the Xinhai Revolution, the May Fourth Movement, the founding of the Communist Party, all the way to the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, this great debate did not stop. Every step forward in the historical movement has a debate. There were debates before and after the start of the War of Resistance Against Japan. From whether or not to resist Japan, whether it was possible to resist Japan, to how to resist Japan, the struggle between the two lines always existed. At the beginning of the Liberation War, there was another debate. After a long period of debate, the slogans of anti-imperialism, anti-feudalism, and anti-bureaucratic capitalism have taken root in the hearts of the people. After the founding of the country, our socialist revolution and socialist construction have progressed rapidly. After the general line for the transition period was proposed, although widespread publicity was carried out, there was not enough time to conduct a nationwide great debate. The bourgeoisie and bourgeois intellectuals were not convinced by this revolution and the leadership of the proletariat. The Rightist elements among them wanted to compete. This time they competed, and they failed. They became one side of the debate, the negative figures, and launched a great debate with our hundreds of millions of people. They became our negative "teachers." With these "teachers," it is easy to debate.

Now, we are conducting the anti-Rightist struggle using the method of presenting facts and reasoning. This method is the best way to thoroughly crush the enemy and rapidly improve ourselves.

In addition to the anti-Rightist struggle, the method of great debate is also the method of rectification. Democratic parties, education circles, journalism circles, science and technology circles, literature and art circles, health circles, industry and commerce circles, the working class, the peasant class, and all strata of handicraft workers and other urban and rural laborers should conduct rectification and socialist education, in batches. Now, the rectification of leading organs is underway. The great debate in the countryside has already begun, and Shanghai has conducted trials in several factories. In Shanghai, we must gradually promote from the municipal-level organs to all grassroots levels, including neighborhood residents' committees, so that everyone participates in the debate and conducts rectification and socialist education. In the middle of this, for the bourgeoisie and bourgeois intellectuals, it is to make them resolve the issue of accepting socialist transformation; for the petty bourgeoisie (peasants and urban and rural independent laborers), especially the wealthy middle peasants, it is also to make them accept socialist transformation; for the working class and the basic ranks of the Communist Party, it is to rectify the work style. These are issues in two social categories with different natures. But they are all called rectification. The method is criticism and self-criticism, presenting facts, reasoning, and great debate. Through rectification, we will correct the political direction, improve the ideological level, correct the shortcomings in our work, unite the broad masses, and isolate the Rightists. If we do not win in this great debate, the socialist cause cannot move forward. As long as we win, we will move forward by leaps and bounds.

Big-character posters, forums, and debates are three good forms for exposing and overcoming contradictions and promoting people's progress. Big-character posters can be used everywhere except for store outlets, rural areas (districts and townships), and elementary schools. Under the conditions in our country, this is a form of struggle that is beneficial to the proletariat and detrimental to the bourgeoisie. It is groundless to be afraid of big-character posters.

In rectification, production and work should not be delayed at any time. There are many urgent tasks before us, such as increasing production and practicing economy, completing basic construction, and doing a good job of market management. Therefore, we must implement the policy of not delaying both rectification production and work.

We Communist Party members must continue to rectify. Now we must rectify while correcting. The majority of our Party organizations and Party members are good and are seriously carrying out rectification. Recently, because of the anti-Rightist campaign, a few Party members have relaxed their efforts to improve their work and are not correcting what can be corrected. This is wrong. Some things involve many aspects and are not easy to act on rashly, but anything that can be corrected must be corrected, and methods must be studied for what cannot be corrected temporarily. Communist Party members must be full of vigor, must maintain close ties with the masses, and must have a strong revolutionary will to overcome any difficulties. In order to build socialism, we must consciously overcome bureaucracy, sectarianism, subjectivism, and all non-proletarian ideological work styles and pass this socialist "test" well. Otherwise, even if we have a glorious history in the past, we still cannot pass this socialist "test." A Communist Party member must always be full of vigor and persist in struggling for the lofty ideal of communism.

We also hope that through the nationwide rectification and great debate, people from all walks of life will receive a profound socialist education, further transform themselves politically and ideologically, and resolutely take the socialist road under the leadership of the working class. We also have higher hopes that in this great struggle and in the construction cause in the future, a large number of strong revolutionaries will be trained. Our working-class-led country not only needs a large number of politicians, military strategists, and Marxist theorists who are infinitely loyal to the proletarian socialist cause, but also a large number of technical cadres, professors, teachers, reporters

    深入反右派斗争　开展全民性整风
　  柯庆施同志在上海市人民代表大会预备会议上的政治报告（摘要）
    我们国家的社会主义改造和社会主义建设取得了伟大的成绩，我们将要为完成这一任务作更大的努力。
    半年来的事实证明：单是1956年在经济战线上，也就是在生产资料所有制上的社会主义革命是不够的，必须有一个政治战线和思想战线上的彻底的社会主义革命。整风和反右派斗争，就是这种革命。这是一个伟大的斗争，这一仗不打胜，社会主义是没有希望的。我们一定要深入反右派斗争，开展全民性的整风，把这个革命进行到底，直到取得彻底的完全的胜利。反右派斗争，是关系到国家民族生死存亡的斗争，有伟大的历史意义和世界意义。
    我想谈四个问题，供各位代表讨论：一、上海整风和反右派斗争的形势；二、资产阶级右派的性质和反右派斗争的意义；三、在反右派斗争中每个人要有鲜明的立场；四、开展全民性大辩论，进行全民性整风。
　  一、上海整风和反右派斗争的形势
    1956年是我国社会主义革命取得决定性胜利的一年。这个伟大的胜利使我国的生产资料所有制发生了根本性的变化，它不能不反映在人们的意识上。
    根据这种形势，一年多来，党中央和毛主席提出了一系列的政策，总的题目就是关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题，以便在人民内部，通过发扬民主，用说服的方法而不是用压服的方法去解决自己的问题，发扬大家建设社会主义的积极性。今年4月，又决定开展整风运动，以便经过整风，使党的工作更能适合新的形势，团结一切可以团结的力量，为建设社会主义服务。
    上海的大放大鸣，是在全国宣传会议以后不久，中共上海市委召开知识界代表人士的座谈会开始的。5月12日，市委召开了宣传会议，宣布上海党组织的整风开始，鸣放到了一个高潮。这个过程是我们大家都熟悉的，今天不多讲。
    我只是想重复地说明：我们始终抱着真诚的态度，欢迎各界人士帮助我们党进行整风。我们党的工作，确实取得了伟大的成绩，但在具体工作中也确实存在着一些缺点和错误。我们 党从来没有为这样伟大的成绩所陶醉，而不注意即令是个别的缺点或细小的错误。因此，解放战争胜利以后的八年中，我们党曾经再三在全党范围内，进行了克服缺点，纠正错误，整顿作风，提高思想水平的斗争。我们完全知道，这不但是我们党内的事，而且关系着我们国家的前途。上海人民，如同全国人民一样，从爱护党、爱护社会主义的愿望出发，对党的整风运动是拥护的。在大放大鸣中，大多数人提出的批评是善意的（虽然有一部分并不完全正确），我们再一次感谢他们，并且欢迎他们继续帮助我们整风。
    也如同大家所看到的，资产阶级右派利用整风，混在那些真心善意地帮助党整风的人们中间，向党发起了猖狂的进攻。
    大家知道，上海的右派分子存在已久，在历次政治运动和重大政治事件到来的时候，他们都进行过破坏活动。去年匈牙利事件前后，他们也动了一下，由于我们在广大群众中进行了分清敌我、明辨是非的教育，他们的阴谋没有得逞。这一次，特别是到了市委宣传工作会议前后，他们对整个形势作了错误的估计，他们把苏共二十次代表大会和匈牙利事件以后社会主义阵营的更加团结和强大看成这个阵营力量的削弱。他们把我国无产阶级的绝对优势看作了绝对劣势，他们低估了工农群众的觉悟程度，低估了知识分子和工商界中大多数人的社会主义认识的提高和接受社会主义改造的可能性，也低估了各民主党派多数成员的认识提高和接受改造的可能性。他们以为：“整个形势一边倒”，“共产党不行了”，只要点起火来，共产党就要完了。于是，他们不听任何劝告，到处散布反党反人民反社会主义的恶毒的言论，并到各机关、团体、工厂、学校放火，真是一时急风骤雨，邪气冲天，连同“乌鸦”叫，也都来了，他们向共产党和社会主义制度发动了有纲领、有组织、有计划的大进攻，利令智昏，猖狂已极。
    谁也看得到：这场大战是右派挑起来的。我们是诚心诚意进行整风，诚心诚意欢迎各界人士的批评，而右派发动了恶毒的进攻。看出这场阶级斗争的不可避免，我们便放手让他们大放大鸣，让毒草大长特长，以便在人民看清之后，大家动手向毒草作斗争。直到6月初，人民群众，首先是工人群众，已经忍无可忍，发起了对右派的反击，形成了声势浩大的反右派斗争。
    现在发展到什么阶段？
    现在的斗争正走向深入。工农群众，青年学生，革命知识分子和拥护社会主义的工商业者的觉悟大大提高，几十万人积极投入了斗争；右派分子已一批批陆续被揭露出来；右派分子的反动言论和阴谋活动正遭到彻底的揭发和批判，他们已经陷入被动和孤立的地位，一部分已低头认罪，一部分仍然在顽抗。总的形势是：经过两个多月的反右派斗争，我们已经取得了决定性的胜利；但是还必须把斗争深入下去，贯彻到底，争取全胜。
    与反右派斗争胜利进行的同时，党的整风仍在继续进行。根据边整边改的方针，各个机关正在分门别类地研究各方面的批评和建议，凡是能够马上作到的，就马上办；凡是牵连很多，需要与有关方面研究的，也将拟出改进方案；凡是不能办或暂时不能办的，将加以解释；虽不属于右派言论，但确属错误的，应加以善意的批评。现在，有些部门改得好些，有些改得差些，也有少数部门做得很差，我们正督促他们继续改，边整边改，决不停止。
    我们的目标，是要造成一个又有集中又有民主，又有纪律又有自由，又有统一意志，又有个人心情舒畅、生动活泼，那样一种政治局面，以利于社会主义革命和社会主义建设，较易于克服困难，较快地建设我国的现代工业和现代农业，党和国家较为巩固，较为能够经受风险。这是我们党总结了许多历史经验得出的结论。我们的党提出正确处理人民内部矛盾，就是为了造成这种政治局面。这是我们国家政治生活的总方向。因此，正确处理人民内部矛盾的总方针，百花齐放、百家争鸣、长期共存、互相监督等等各项政策，必须也将会继续贯彻执行，绝不因为反右派斗争半途而废。反右派斗争，正是为造成这种政治局面创造条件，因为我们人民同资产阶级右派没有共同语言，不取得反右派斗争的胜利，这种政治局面是不可能造成的。因此，怀疑不再整风了，不再鸣放了，是没有根据的。
    二、资产阶级右派的性质和反右派斗争的意义
    关于资产阶级右派的性质，7月1日人民日报社论指出：“资产阶级右派就是前面说的反共反人民反社会主义的资产阶级反动派，这是科学的合乎实际情况的说明。”社论说：“这是一小撮人，民主党派、知识分子、资本家、青年学生里都有，共产党、青年团里面也有，在这次大风浪中表现出来了。他们人数极少，在民主党派中，特别在某几个民主党派中却有力量，不可轻视。这种人不但有言论，而且有行动，他们是有罪的，‘言者无罪’对他们不适用。他们不但是言者，而且是行者。是不是要办罪呢？现在看来，可以不必。因为人民的国家很巩固，他们中许多又是一些头面人物。可以宽大为怀，不予办罪。一般称呼，‘右派分子’也就可以了，不必称为反动派。只在一种情况下除外，就是累戒不改，继续进行破坏活动，触犯刑律，那就要办罪。惩前毖后，治病救人，化消极因素为积极因素，这些原则，对他们还是适用。另有一种右派，有言论，无行动。言论同上述那种右派相仿，但无破坏性行动。对这种人，那就更要宽大些了。错误的言论一定要批判干净，这是不能留情的，但应允许他们保留自己的意见。所有上述各种人，仍然允许有言论自由。一个伟大的巩固的国家，保存这样一小批人，在广大群众了解了他们的错误以后，不会有什么害处。”这样做，从长远来看，对无产阶级革命事业是更为有利的。
    经过几个月来的揭露和批判，越来越多的材料证明了资产阶级右派的这次进攻，是有纲领、有组织、有计划的猖狂进攻。
      在这个猖狂进攻中，他们攻击我们的五大运动三大改造，根本否定我们社会主义改造和社会主义建设的成绩，谁说成绩是主要的，缺点是次要的，就被判处“教条主义”、“掩盖错误”的大罪，甚至有的被污蔑为他们所谓的“反革命分子”；他们攻击社会主义的政治制度和经济制度，诬蔑我们的社会主义制度是一切错误的根源；他们攻击共产党的领导，要共产党退出学校、工厂、报社、法院和科学文艺等等一切单位，并用“政治设计院”、“平反委员会”等等代替共产党的领导；他们攻击无产阶级专政，攻击民主集中制，攻击我国的外交政策，反对苏联，反对社会主义国家的团结。总之，他们反对社会主义，反对共产党的领导。他们要的是资本主义道路，要的是由他们资产阶级右派来领导，要的是地主、资产阶级的复辟。他们不但以上述各项作为他们的反动纲领，而且以章罗联盟为首包括其它一些右派野心家，在全国各地进行有组织的有计划的破坏活动。我们上海人民已经揭发的大量的事实，充分证明了他们在上海的活动，无一不是根据他们的反动纲领进行的。这一切都说明他们已经公然违反了他们同我们一起举手通过的宪法，他们已经公然站在反抗社会主义革命，敌视和破坏社会主义建设的地位了。
    经过这几个月的大辩论，他们已经理屈词穷，有些人已经作了交代，低头认罪，这是我们所欢迎的。但是还有一些人不服输，不肯彻底交代，更有一些右派分子在人民的追击之下，败下阵来，改变腔调，好像他们的错误只是思想问题，不是政治问题；好像他们从来不反共反社会主义，反而是拥护共产党、拥护社会主义的。他们自称“动机是好的，效果是坏的”。这完全是骗人的。我们不妨列举一些右派的论点来分析一下。
    例如：对成绩的估计。在平时，我们并不愿意把“成绩是主要的”挂在嘴上，自我陶醉，我们总是告诫自己不要为胜利冲昏头脑，实行戒骄戒躁的方针。这一次，我们为什么要大讲特讲成绩是主要的呢？这是因为右派根本否认有成绩。他们为什么这样坚决地否认成绩呢？一方面，由于立场不同，对什么叫成绩、缺点，看法也各有不同。中国解放了，我们中国人民看作是百年来无数先烈流血牺牲、几万万人英勇奋斗的大成绩；帝国主义、蒋介石、资产阶级右派却认为是大错误；五大运动、三大改造的胜利，拥护社会主义的人看作是社会主义革命的伟大成绩，反社会主义的右派分子却认为“一团糟”，这是没有什么奇怪的。另一方面，他们否定成绩，把个别的和局部的缺点或错误夸大为根本的和全面的错误，是为了从根本上否认我们八年来革命和建设的正确性，从而根本否认社会主义革命和社会主义建设的基本道路的正确性，是为了煽惑那些认识不清、立场动摇的人摆脱党的领导，离开社会主义道路，跟着他们走资本主义道路。
    我们从来没有说过我们没有缺点和错误，在中国历史上，也从来没有别的阶级和政党能够像无产阶级、共产党这样在全国范围内征求群众的批评。这是因为我们知道：我们的缺点和错误，是前进中的缺点和错误，是可以克服的。就以官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义来说，我们就和地主资产阶级反动统治者有根本的不同。共产党是代表人民的根本利益的，地主资产阶级反动统治者是根本反对人民的，他们是剥削劳动人民的能手，这是两种本质上不同的情况。因此，地主资产阶级反动统治是产生官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义的温床。这三种主义，他们是根本不想克服也不能克服的。而共产党是以为人民服务为宗旨的，我们所有的党员、干部（个别除外）是勤勤恳恳为人民工作的。他们的官僚主义作风是从旧社会传染来的，共产党是根本反对官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义的，而且依靠群众的监督，依靠马克思主义思想水平的提高，是可以逐渐克服的。但是，资产阶级右派把我们的缺点夸大起来，用来丑化共产党，丑化社会主义制度，这同我们指出缺点错误，是两种态度、两种目的：我们是为了克服它，纠正它，资产阶级右派是为了反共反社会主义。
    例如：关于党的领导。没有党的领导，就没有新中国；既然资产阶级民主革命都必须由共产党领导，才取得了彻底胜利；社会主义革命和社会主义建设，离开共产党领导反而能够成功，这岂不是怪事？共产党的领导地位，不是自封的，是历史发展的必然结果，是中国人民从流血牺牲的无数教训中选择的结果。因此，右派分子中，少数最疯狂的分子，高叫要共产党下台、要杀共产党，其中有一小部分也真的这样干了。但是，他们这种行动很快地就被群众识破了，他们的反动面目也立刻暴露于天下。右派分子中的那些有政治经验的，主要是受过资产阶级长期训练并有与无产阶级作政治斗争的经验的分子，却采取较为迂回的进攻策略。他们懂得叫共产党下台，太暴露了，他们从局部开始，说共产党领导这样不行，领导那样不行，说共产党应当退出这个部门，应当退出那个部门。他们自以为文教界容易听他们的话，他们就想先从这里打开缺口，然后逐步推开，目的在于取共产党的领导地位而代之。他们懂得政治领导和组织领导是不可分的，而有些人却不懂得这一点，于是右派分子就煽动群众，说是共产党只要政治领导就好了，不要什么组织领导，各个机关不必要有共产党员担任工作，公私合营单位不必要有公方代表，学校也不要什么党委领导，使用干部不要政治标准等等，否则就是宗派主义，就是“党天下”。其实，共产党从来是主张并实行与党外人士合作的政策的，我们并不要清一色，实际上也不是“清一色”。就拿我们上海市的地方国家权力机关市人民代表大会来说，七百九十名市人民代表中，中共党员只有三百二十六人，还不到一半。在任何单位共产党员都是少数，没有党外干部的积极努力，我们的工作是难以取胜的。右派分子攻击“党天下”，是没有事实根据的。他们攻击的“党天下”实际上是反对无产阶级（通过共产党）领导的人民的新中国。美国通讯社和报刊，把解放了的中国，叫作共产党中国，这同右派分子说中国是“党天下”，一模一样。右派分子反对共产党的另一恶毒阴谋就是反对基层干部，他们说基层干部糟得很，非大反特反不可，他们这样诬蔑勤勤恳恳为广大人民服务的基层干部，其目的就是“釜底抽薪”，从基础上撼动党的领导，同时也反映出他们对于最熟悉他们的、经常发生面对面斗争的基层干部的刻骨仇恨。这里面并没有多少高深的道理，只要问一问工人们就行了，他们可以很简单地告诉我们，没有公方代表会是什么样子，因为他们既有没有公方代表的经验、又有有了公方代表的经验。高等学校也是一样，以“教授治校”来取消党委的领导，到底是加强了领导，还是削弱了领导？只要把解放前的学校和今天的情况加以认真的比较，是很容易得出结论的。至于不以政治标准鉴别人、使用人，这是世界上根本不存在的幻想，只要有阶级存在，就有各自的用人标准。艾森豪威尔绝不会用共产党员给他当参谋长，也不会用美国的进步人士作国务卿。右派分子自己也是以政治标准用人的，他们还没有上台执政，就已经下决心不要共产党员、不要“桥头堡”即积极分子了，他们如果真的上了台，难道会改变这种主张吗？他们的这一套，以及他们所说的“大材小用”，“小材大用”，“有德无才”，“有才无德”等等，都不过是为了掩饰他们取消共产党的领导，实行资产阶级右派复辟的阴谋罢了。我们中国人民在地主资产阶级反动统治下长期生活过，他们的才与德是怎么回事，我们是有深刻的了解的。
    例如：关于集中与民主，纪律与自由。资产阶级右派煽动群众说，在社会主义制度下，在共产党领导下，只有集中、纪律，没有民主、自由，而在资本主义制度下，在他们资产阶级右派的领导下，将会根本改变这种情况。毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲话中，已经科学地论证了这个问题，毛主席指出：“实际上，世界上只有具体的自由，具体的民主，没有抽象的自由，抽象的民主。在阶级斗争的社会里，有了剥削阶级剥削劳动人民的自由，就没有劳动人民不受剥削的自由。有了资产阶级的民主，就没有无产阶级和劳动人民的民主。”“在人民内部，不可以没有自由，也不可以没有纪律；不可以没有民主，也不可以没有集中。这种民主和集中的统一，自由和纪律的统一，就是我们的民主集中制。在这个制度下，人民享受着广泛的民主和自由；同时又必须用社会主义的纪律约束自己。这些道理，广大人民群众是懂得的。”人民群众为什么懂得？因为人民曾经长期在没有人民的民主、自由，只有反动派的民主、自由的反动统治下生活过。在资本主义的工厂里，在地主阶级统治下的乡村里不正是这样的吗？同时，在同反动统治作斗争的过程中，我们也深刻地懂得了只有民主集中制才能保证我们的胜利。在建设我们的国家的时候，为了维护人民的最大的利益，为了社会主义的利益，难道只要民主、自由，不要集中、纪律是可能的吗？那是根本不可能的。右派分子说：劳动人民知识水平低，不懂民主自由，这是胡说，为了争取祖国的民主自由，劳动人民牺牲最大、贡献最多，这难道是知识水平低的表现吗？资产阶级所说的那种民主自由是根本不存在的。在资本主义社会里，只有为资产阶级服务的自由，没有为工农兵服务的自由。任何一个思想家、艺术家、科学家的进步活动都不能不受到资产阶级的压迫。只有在社会主义制度下，他们才有了为劳动人民服务的自由。在这种条件下，不要集中，不要纪律，只要“绝对的民主”，“绝对的自由”，只能导致无政府主义，只有利于资产阶级，不利于无产阶级。只有正确地实行民主集中制，才能保证造成一个又有集中又有民主，又有纪律又有自由，又有统一意志又有个人心情舒畅、生动活泼的政治局面，这是任何剥削阶级所不能达到的局面。
    例如：学习苏联。为了建设一个伟大的社会主义国家，苏联的经验对我们无疑地是重要的。正是因为有了苏联的经验（成功的和错误的），我们才少走了弯路。我们的方针是将外国的经验同我国的具体情况相结合，但是，当我们还没有经过实践的时候，选择外国经验已经不易，结合起来、结合得好更加不易，需要时间，需要代价，只能争取缩短时间、少付代价。教条主义是有害的，必须克服，但是把马克思主义的普遍真理和苏联的先进经验统统当作“教条”来反对，这种修正主义的观点是更加有害的。资产阶级右派分子所以反对“教条主义”、反对学习苏联，并不真的是反对教条主义，而是站在仇视苏联、仇视马克思主义、仇视社会主义的反动立场，进行反共反苏的活动。只要看他们多么仇视我们的外交政策，就更明显了。
    我们上面举的这些例子，以及其他举不胜举的例子，都说明了资产阶级右派分子的言论和行动，都不是一般的思想认识问题，而是政治问题，不是一般的政治问题，而是一场激烈的阶级斗争，这是关系国家生死存亡的根本问题。如果他们的阴谋得逞，那将是资本主义复辟，那将是重新回到殖民地半殖民地的奴隶地位，那将是千百万人头落地。为了在中国实现社会主义的伟大理想，我们中国人民已经付出了重大的代价，我们决不能把已经得到的胜利断送在这一伙右派野心家手里。反右派斗争的意义绝不能估计低了，绝不能采取温情主义，这个斗争不取得胜利，社会主义是没有希望的。我们一定要把这个斗争进行到彻底胜利。
　  三、在反右派斗争中，每个人要有鲜明的立场
    社会主义的道路是百年来中国人民找到的最正确的道路。解放以来，祖国面貌日新月异的变化，证实了这一真理。反右派斗争是捍卫社会主义道路的斗争。这个斗争，关系我们祖国社会主义的前途，关系祖国的生死存亡，这个斗争就成为我们 每个人的切身的事情。进一步说，社会主义革命是历史上空前的、最深刻的革命，它不能不触动每一个人的思想深处，每个人不能不确定对这个革命的态度，特别是当资产阶级右派举行猖狂进攻，抗拒和破坏社会主义革命和社会主义建设的时候，每个人更不能不有鲜明的立场，即走无产阶级领导的社会主义道路，还是资产阶级右派领导的资本主义道路，在这个问题上，寻找中间道路是不可能的。谁如果企图走中间道路，不管他主观上如何，他都不能不是帮助了右派。
    几个月来的大风大浪也确实考验了所有的人。首先是暴露了右派。前面说过，上海的右派是存在已久的，这次暴露得比较彻底。他们中间，主要是这三种人：一种是原来民主革命时期民主党派中的右翼，他们历来代表资产阶级右翼的立场，有比较多的政治斗争经验，又有“民主教授”“进步人士”等伪装，在一部分群众中有欺骗作用，这次起了带头和组织进攻的作用；一种是过去的当权派，是国民党时期的台上人物，他们已臭名远扬，又不甘心退出历史舞台，平时不敢抛头露面，这次以为天下大变，也纷纷出动了；还有一种是政治上一向心怀不满的人，以及其他抗拒社会主义革命的资产阶级分子。这几种人是客观存在，遇有机会总要浮出来的。这次大暴露，不足为奇，而且是好事。
    但是，右派毕竟是少数。这次的大风浪证明党中央提出正确处理人民内部矛盾，公开整风，大放大鸣，是完全正确的。我们必须坚定地信任群众，人民群众中的大多数，首先是工农基本群众的多数，是可以信任的。就是工商界和知识界的大多数，经过这次考验，也证明是好人多，坏人少。他们中间的多数有接受无产阶级领导和接受社会主义改造的倾向，虽然各人的程度深浅不同。而经过这次反右派斗争，他们普遍地受到了一次深刻的社会主义教育，这是有利于他们抛弃原来的立场，向工人阶级立场靠近一大步的。
    我们每个人应当抓紧这个宝贵的机会，努力改造自己，过好社会主义这一“关”。这一“关”，是每个人必须过的，不能不过的，因为社会主义革命触动每一个人。但是，很多人对参加这个革命，并没有精神准备。这个革命，对于他们是突然发生的。共产党员和共青团员中也有这种人。因此，在大放大鸣中，有些人一时地不知所措，或者发生了动摇，也是不足为奇的。我们希望他们接受各自的教训，好比打了防疫针，增加了抵抗力，并且在这个基础上努力地克服缺点，改造自己，确定自己的鲜明的工人阶级的立场。应该看到改造自己的旧立场、旧观点、旧作风是光荣的事情，只要不是留恋过去，就不应有自卑的情绪。当然，思想改造不是一朝一夕能彻底完成的，但是，在反右派斗争中，每个人的政治觉悟可以比平时提高得迅速得多。我们希望他们，在目前，首先分清敌我，站稳立场，辨明是非，抛弃观望态度，抛弃温情主义，积极地参加到反右派斗争中来，为今后的彻底改造自己打下比较巩固的基础。特别是从旧社会来的知识分子，应该看到自我改造的必要性，认识到除掉为工农劳动人民服务而外，已经没有服务的对象了，因此，希望他们更加自觉地改造自己，与劳动人民打成一片。
    四、开展全民性的大辩论进行全民性的整风
    这次整风和反右派斗争，是一场公开的全民性的大辩论。辩论的题目，就是我们革命和建设工作是否正确（革命和建设的成绩是不是主要的），是否应走社会主义道路，要不要共产党领导，要不要无产阶级专政，要不要民主集中制，以及我国的外交政策是否正确等项重大问题。这个大辩论，也就是政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命，经过这个大辩论，整顿共产党的作风，对资产阶级、小资产阶级进行社会主义改造。
    这次大辩论是很必要的，一定要发生的。在民主革命时期，曾经进行过大辩论，从康梁维新，辛亥革命，五四运动，共产党成立，一直到一九四九年中华人民共和国成立，这个大辩论都没有停止。历史运动每前进一步都有一场辩论。抗日战争开始前后有辩论，从要不要抗战，能不能抗战，到怎样抗战，两条路线的斗争是始终存在的。解放战争开始，又有辩论。经过长期的辩论，反帝反封建反官僚资本的口号已深入人心。建国以后，我们的社会主义革命和社会主义建设进展很快，过渡时期总路线提出以后，虽曾进行了广泛的宣传，但没有来得及进行全民性的大辩论。资产阶级和资产阶级知识分子，对这个革命和无产阶级的领导不心服，他们中的右派分子要较量一下，这次较量了，他们失败了。他们做了辩论的一方，是反面人物，同我们几万万人这一方展开大辩论，他们作了我们的反面的“教员”，有了这些“教员”，就好辩论了。
    现在，我们正在进行的反右派斗争用摆事实、说道理的方法，这个方法是彻底粉碎敌人，迅速提高自己的最好的方法。
    在反右派斗争之外，大辩论的方法，也就是整风的方法。民主党派，教育界，新闻界，科技界，文艺界，卫生界，工商界，工人阶级，农民阶级各阶层，手工业工人和其他城乡劳动者都应当进行整风和社会主义教育，分期分批进行。现在领导机关的整风正在进行。农村的大辩论已经开始，上海已在几个工厂试验。我们上海，要从市级机关逐步推广到各个基层，包括里弄居民委员会，使所有的人都参加辩论，进行整风和社会主义教育。这中间，对资产阶级和资产阶级知识分子是使他们解决接受社会主义改造问题；对小资产阶级（农民和城乡独立劳动者），特别是富裕中农，也是使他们接受社会主义改造的问题；对工人阶级和共产党的基本队伍，则是整顿作风的问题。这是性质不同的两个社会范畴的问题。但是都叫作整风。方法就是批评和自我批评，摆事实，讲道理，大辩论。经过整风，端正政治方向，提高思想水平，改正工作缺点，团结广大群众，孤立右派。如果我们在这次大辩论中，不能取胜，社会主义事业就不能前进；只要我们取得了胜利，我们就会大踏步前进。
    大字报、座谈会和辩论会是揭露和克服矛盾、推动人们进步的三种很好的形式。大字报，除商店的门市部、农村（区乡）、小学以外，都可以用。在我国的条件下，这是一个有利于无产阶级而不利于资产阶级的斗争形式。怕大字报，是没有根据的。
    在整风中，任何时候都不应当耽误生产和工作。摆在我们的面前，有着许多迫切的任务，如增产节约、完成基本建设、搞好市场管理等等，因之，我们必须贯彻执行整风生产工作两不误的方针。
    我们共产党员一定要继续整风。现在就要边整边改。我们大多数的党组织和党员是好的，是认真进行整风的。最近，因为反右派，有少数党员放松了改进工作，能改的也不改，这是不对的。有些事，牵连较多，不好草率从事，但凡能改的都要改，暂不能改的要研究办法。共产党员一定要有朝气，一定要密切联系群众，一定要有坚强的革命意志，百折不挠地去克服任何困难。为了建设社会主义，必须自觉地克服官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义和一切非无产阶级的思想作风，过好社会主义这一“关”。否则虽有过去的光荣历史，社会主义这一“关”同样是过不了的。一个共产党员，要永远是朝气蓬勃地为共产主义的远大理想坚持奋斗。
    我们也希望通过全民性的整风和大辩论，各界人民都受到一次深刻的社会主义教育，在政治上、思想上得到进一步改造，坚决地在工人阶级领导下走社会主义的道路。我们还抱着更高的希望，希望在这次伟大的斗争中和今后的建设事业中锻炼出大批的坚强的革命家。我们工人阶级领导的国家，不但需要有人数众多的、对无产阶级社会主义事业无限忠诚的政治家、军事家和马克思主义理论家，而且同样需要人数众多的、对无产阶级社会主义事业无限忠诚的技术干部、教授、教员、记者、编辑、文学家、艺术家。造就这样一个新式的强大的工人阶级知识分子的队伍，对工人阶级和社会主义事业有伟大的意义。我们不但鼓励工人、农民学习文化，把自己提高到知识分子的水平；我们同样希望已经是知识分子的同志们和朋友们，精神奋发地、朝气蓬勃地、百折不挠地、彻底地改造自己，坚决地站到无产阶级的立场上来，加入到无产阶级知识分子的队伍里来，全心全意为无产阶级社会主义的事业服务。这个队伍成长得越快，我们的社会主义事业发展得越快。
    我们的会议是在一个重要的时间举行的，祝这次会议把上海的反右派斗争推向一个新的高潮，把上海的整风运动推向前进，把我们的各项工作推向前进，随着全国社会主义改造和社会主义建设事业的前进，使上海的整个面目焕然一新。
