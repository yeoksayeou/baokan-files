Xinhua News Agency, August 18th: The Second Representative Conference of the Chinese Hui People's Cultural Advancement Association, currently in session, exposed and criticized the anti-Communist and anti-socialist words and deeds of Ma Songting, the vice chairman of the Chinese Hui People's Cultural Advancement Association.

According to the exposure, rightist Ma Songting is a long-term reactionary political careerist disguised in religious clothing. For more than thirty years, he has not only colluded with the Northern Warlords, the Kuomintang, and the scum of the Hui people such as Bai Chongxi, Ma Hongkui, and Ma Bufang to oppose the Communist Party, but also used his position as an Ahong to sell out religion and the interests of the Hui people. Before liberation, he used the name of "Chinese Muslim Leader" to go abroad to various Islamic countries in the Middle East three times to promote the so-called "benevolent governance" of the Kuomintang reactionaries and defame the revolutionary movement led by the Chinese Communist Party. When the country was about to be liberated, he abandoned his wife and children and fled from Beijing to Shanghai, taking advantage of Li Zongren's feigned peace talks to wait for the appearance of a "North-South Dynasty situation" in China. A month before Shanghai's liberation, he fled to Taiwan. After Chiang Kai-shek's delusion of counterattacking the mainland was shattered by the people of the whole country, Ma Songting adopted a double-dealing approach and returned to Beijing. The Communist Party and the People's Government, with a broad-minded spirit of not dwelling on the past, strived to win him over to make contributions and atone for his crimes for the Hui people, and also recommended him for important positions such as member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, vice chairman of the China Islamic Association, vice chairman of the Chinese Hui People's Cultural Advancement Association, and vice president of the Beijing Islamic Theological Institute. However, after returning to the mainland, Ma Songting still held a hostile attitude towards the Communist Party. This time, taking advantage of the Communist Party's rectification movement, Ma Songting launched a massive attack on the Communist Party. He lit fires everywhere among the Islamic community and the Hui people, attempting to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party on religious and ethnic issues, and妄想妄想 to restore his ruling power during the Kuomintang period.

At the meeting from the 14th to the 17th, more than twenty people, including Wu Hongye, Li Anmin, Du Guanwu, Chang Zijiu, Yang Zhaojun, Shan Yichang, An Shijie, Ma Yuhuai, and Yang Xiaoting, spoke to expose and criticize Ma Songting.

Hui Association member Yang Zhaojun said in his speech: When rightist Ma Songting was studying at the Socialist Academy, he took advantage of the Communist Party's rectification movement to spread poison in the academy. The reactionary remarks he made that were recorded alone amounted to fifty-six. After liberation, the Hui people got rid of national oppression and improved their economic lives. Everyone was rejoicing, but Ma Songting said, "Now the Hui people are very distressed." He said this during his studies and also among relatives and friends. He attempted to use these words to provoke the flesh-and-blood relationship between the Communist Party and the Hui people. Ma Songting also spread rumors: the government treats him and Da Pusheng as two pots of flowers, one placed in the Islamic Association and one placed in the Hui People's Cultural Advancement Association. This was his malicious slander of the Communist Party's re-employment of him, and he also attempted to provoke the relationship between Da Pusheng and the Party. Yang Zhaojun pointed out that Ma Songting is not a pot of fresh flowers, but a pot of poisonous weeds.

Yang Zhaojun also revealed that Ma Songting, as the vice chairman of the Hui Association, denied the achievements of the Hui Association's work in recent years and slandered that the Hui Association's work was not in line with its purpose and tasks. He defamed the Hui Association as an "assimilation of the Hui people" agency, saying that the Communist Party cadres in the Hui Association did not understand the affairs of the Hui people, attempting to seize the Communist Party's leadership over the Hui Association. Ma Songting scolded the Hui youth, saying that the progressive Hui youth had all broken away from the Hui people and ate pork; and maliciously fabricated facts, saying that the Hui girls had all married Han people.

Hui Association member Shan Yichang (female) exposed at the meeting the fact that Ma Songting hated the Communist Party and provoked the flesh-and-blood relationship between the Communist Party and the Hui people everywhere. She said that when the Party was helping the Hui people prepare for the establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, everyone was overjoyed, but Ma Songting was downcast. He hated other Ahongs and sarcastically called the Ahongs in uniforms "Red Ahongs." In June of last year, Ma Songting convened a meeting of Hui people in Beijing's cattle and sheep industry. At the meeting, he cried bitterly and said that before liberation, the Hui people in the cattle and sheep industry only cared about selling beef and mutton and did not care about breeding work. Why should they do this work now? He used this to provoke the relationship between the cattle and sheep industry and the government. Ma Songting hated the leading cadres among the Hui people and openly claimed that he would first strike at Liu Ge and Ma Yuhuai on the issue of the Hui people. He, like rightist Ge Peiqi, shouted the voice of killing Communists.

Ma Songting's sinful activities before liberation were also exposed at the meeting.

Ma Yuhuai revealed that before liberation, Ma Songting used the opportunity of running the Chengda Normal School to carry out reactionary political activities. He advocated "the unity of politics and religion" and stipulated that the three major purposes of running the Chengda Normal School were to train pastors, principals, and Baojia chiefs. This was serving the Kuomintang reactionaries under the guise of religious education. He also colluded with Zhu Jiahua, Chen Lifu, and Chen Bule to engage in anti-Communist activities. Bai Chongxi was defeated in Siping Street and returned to Beijing by plane at night. At four o'clock that night, he used a car to pick up Ma Songting to secretly plan decisions.

Ma Yin, deputy secretary-general of the Islamic Association, stripped away the guise that Ma Songting had always flaunted as an "apolitical Ahong." Ma Yin said that when Ma Songting was at Chengda Normal School, he arranged the Kuomintang party class as a major course. When a student listened to Yan'an radio, he drove the student out of the school. His most proud students became Kuomintang spies. He called on the Hui people to carry out "suppressing the rebellion and building the country" and used the mosque as a base for "suppressing the rebellion and building the country." He used his identity as an Ahong to run around everywhere and went to Shanghai, Nanjing, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai and other places to appeal for "suppressing the rebellion and building the country." Ma Hongkui also gave him 10,000 yuan in silver dollars as anti-Communist activity funds. He boasted in Egypt that he was "the leader of 50 million Hui people in China" and said in Egypt that the Kuomintang's crime of killing Hui people was the Kuomintang's meticulous care for the Hui people.

Ahongs Zhang Huadong, Mi Changmao, Guan Huating, Yuan Shixian, and Ma Yucheng all unanimously pointed out at the meeting that rightist Ma Songting is a reactionary political careerist disguised in religious clothing.

The Hui Association meeting is continuing to expose and criticize the reactionary words and deeds of rightist Ma Songting.

    出卖回族利益　挑拨回汉关系
    马松亭反共三十年野心不死
    新华社18日讯　正在举行的中国回民文化协进会第二届代表会议，揭露和批判了中国回民文化协进会副主任马松亭的反共反社会主义的言行。
    据揭露，右派分子马松亭是一个长期披着宗教外衣的反动的政治野心家。三十多年来他不但勾结北洋军阀、国民党和回族中的败类白崇禧、马鸿逵、马步芳等反对共产党，而且利用阿訇的身分出卖宗教，出卖回族利益。解放前他曾经假借“中国穆斯林领袖”的名义，三次出国到中东各伊斯兰教国家宣扬国民党反动派的所谓“德政”，诋毁中国共产党领导的革命运动。全国将要解放时，他遗弃妻子儿女由北京逃往上海，借着李宗仁假意和谈的机会等待中国出现“南北朝局面”。上海临解放前一个月，他逃往台湾，蒋介石反攻大陆的妄想被全国人民打破以后，马松亭才采取两面派的手法回到北京。共产党和人民政府以不究既往的宽大精神争取他为回族人民立功赎罪，并且推举他为政协全国委员会委员、中国伊斯兰教协会副主任、中国回民文化协进会副主任和北京伊斯兰经学院副院长的重要职位。但是马松亭回大陆以后，仍然对共产党抱着敌视的态度。这次，马松亭借共产党整风的机会，向共产党大肆进攻。他在伊斯兰教界和回族人民群众中到处点火，企图在宗教和民族问题上推翻共产党的领导，妄想恢复他在国民党时期的统治势力。
    在14日到17日的会议上发言揭露和批判马松亭的，有吴鸿业、李安民、杜冠武、常子久、杨兆钧、闪懿昌、安士杰、马玉槐、杨小亭等二十多人。
    回协委员杨兆钧发言说：右派分子马松亭在社会主义学院学习时，借着共产党整风的机会，在学院中散布毒素，仅是大家记录下来的他的反动言论就有五十六条。解放后回族人民摆脱了民族压迫，改善了经济生活，大家都在兴高采烈的时候，而马松亭却说“现在回民都很苦恼”。他在学习中这样说，在亲戚朋友中也是这样说，他企图用这种话来挑拨共产党和回民群众的血肉关系。马松亭还散布：政府把他和达浦生当作两盆花，一盆摆在伊斯兰教协会，一盆摆在回民文化协进会。这是他恶意地诬蔑共产党对他的重用，并且企图挑拨达浦生和党的关系。杨兆钧指出，马松亭不是一盆鲜花，而是一盆毒草。
    杨兆钧还揭露，身为回协副主任的马松亭，却否认回协这几年来的工作成绩，诬蔑回协的工作与它的宗旨、任务不符合。他诽谤回协是“同化回民”的机关，说回协的共产党员干部不懂回民的事，企图以此来篡夺共产党对回协的领导权。马松亭谩骂回民青年，说进步的回民青年都脱离了回民群众，吃了猪肉；又恶意地捏造事实，说回民姑娘都嫁了汉民。
    回协委员闪懿昌（女）在会上揭发了马松亭仇视共产党、到处挑拨共产党和回族人民的血肉关系的事实。她说，党在帮助回族人民准备成立宁夏回族自治区时，大家兴高采烈，但是马松亭却垂头丧气。他仇视其他的阿訇，讽刺穿制服的阿訇是“红色阿訇”。去年6月间，马松亭召集北京回民牛羊业者开会。他在会上痛哭流涕地说，解放前回民牛羊业者只管卖牛羊肉，不管饲养工作，现在为什么要作这些工作，他借此来挑拨牛羊业者同政府的关系。马松亭痛恨回民中的领导干部，公然声称要在回民问题上首先向刘格平和马玉槐开刀，他和右派分子葛佩琦一样喊出了杀共产党人的声音。
    马松亭在解放以前的罪恶活动，在这次会议上也被揭发出来。
    马玉槐揭发说：解放前，马松亭利用办成达师范学校的机会进行反动的政治活动，他主张“政教合一”，规定办成达师范的三大目的是训练教长、校长、保甲长，这是披着宗教教育的外衣为国民党反动派服务。他又和朱家骅、陈立夫、陈布雷勾结在一起干反对共产党的勾当。白崇禧在四平街打了败仗，晚上坐飞机回到北京，当晚四点钟用小汽车把马松亭接去密划决策。
    伊斯兰教协会副秘书长马寅剥开了马松亭所一向标榜的他是“超政治的阿訇”的外衣。马寅说，马松亭在成达师范学校的时候，把国民党的党课排成主要的课程，一个学生听了延安的广播，他把学生赶出学校，他最得意的学生都成了国民党特务。他号召回民进行“戡乱建国”，把清真寺作为“戡乱建国”的基地。他利用阿訇的身份到处奔走，到上海、南京、甘肃、宁夏、青海等地为“戡乱建国”而呼吁，马鸿逵还给了他一万块白洋作反共的活动经费。他在埃及吹嘘他是“中国五千万回民的领袖”，并且在埃及把国民党杀害回民的罪行说成是国民党对回民的照顾无微不至。
    张化东、米长茂、管华亭、袁世贤、马玉成等阿訇都在会上一致指出，右派分子马松亭是一个披着宗教外衣的反动的政治野心家。
    回协会议还在继续揭发和批判右派分子马松亭的反动言行。
