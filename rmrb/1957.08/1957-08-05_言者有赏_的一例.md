    An Example of "Rewarding Those Who Speak Out"
  　Zhong Huai
    Liu Yunzhao, a member of the Central Unity Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK) and head of the Yangzhou Provisional Branch, stated at the Jiangsu Provincial Political Consultative Conference that, in order to encourage people to offer opinions, we must not only ensure that speakers are not punished but also that speakers are rewarded.
    When Liu Yunzhao offers opinions to others, he is a "speaker," and naturally he should apply this principle. When others offer opinions to Liu Yunzhao, they are also "speakers," and in principle, this principle should also apply. However, that is not the case. Not long ago, at a meeting of the RCCK Yangzhou Provisional Branch, RCCK member Xiao Zhongfan exposed and criticized some of Liu Yunzhao's reactionary words and deeds. While Xiao was speaking, Liu Yunzhao glared angrily, repeatedly slammed the table and bench, threatened Xiao, and interrupted Xiao's speech. Finally, in the face of undeniable facts, he became enraged and shouted in a violent rage: "I said it, what can you do to me!" Then, he suddenly raised the banana leaf fan in his hand and struck Xiao's body directly, and cursed: "You are 'anti'-Party! You are 'anti'-Party! You scum!"
    The facts are very clear: the "no punishment for speakers" and "rewarding those who speak out" in the mouths of rightists are merely shields for wantonly attacking the Communist Party. The "no punishment for speakers" we speak of only refers to opinions that do not deviate from the socialist path and do not oppose the leadership of the Communist Party. Violating this principle, using the shield of "no punishment for speakers" to incite anti-communist and anti-socialist words and deeds, is a crime against the people and must be resolutely countered.

    “言者有赏”的一例
  　钟怀
    民革中央团结委员会委员、扬州市临时支部负责人刘云昭在江苏省政协会上说过，为了鼓励人提意见，不仅要做到言者无罪，还要言者有赏。
    刘云昭给别人提意见的时候，是“言者”，固然他要运用这条原则；别人给刘云昭提意见的时候，也是“言者”，照理也应当适用这一原则。然而不然。不久以前，在民革扬州市临时支部的一次会议上，民革成员萧中藩揭发批判了刘云昭的一些反动言行。在萧发言的时候，刘云昭却怒目而视，不止一次地拍桌子打板凳，向萧恐吓，打断萧的发言。最后，在无可抵赖的事实前面，竟恼羞成怒，暴跳如雷地高喊：“是我说的，你把我怎么样！”接着，突然举起手里的芭蕉扇，直朝萧的身上打去，并且大骂：“你‘反’党！你‘反’党！你这个败类！”
    事实很明显：右派分子口中的“言者无罪”、“言者有赏”，只是对共产党进行肆意攻击的盾牌。我们所说的“言者无罪”，只是指的那些不离开社会主义道路、不反对共产党的领导的意见。违背了这个原则，举着“言者无罪”的盾牌而煽动反共反社会主义的言行，对人民来说，都是有罪的，必须坚决予以回击。
