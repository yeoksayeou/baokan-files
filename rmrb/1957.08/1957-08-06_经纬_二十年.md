    "Jingwei" Twenty Years
  　Sha Yin
    Recently, I visited the Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory, one of the earliest modern large factories built after the founding of New China. When I went, I happened to encounter thousands of employees engaged in the anti-Rightist struggle. I originally planned to write a news item about the struggle, but an old worker, whom I didn't know, approached me and made this request: write about the twenty-year transformation of the Jingwei Machinery Factory.
    Imagine twenty years ago...
    More than twenty years ago, before the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, China's textile industry had already existed for more than fifty years. However, the textile machinery manufacturing industry was still a "0" at that time. Some capitalists in Shanghai wanted to fill in this "0." At that time, these national capitalists believed that building a textile machinery factory with an annual output of 50,000 spindles was not only possible, but also wouldn't be bad business, so they asked Huang Puqi, who had interned in an American textile machinery factory, to be responsible for the preparations. They named this imagined textile machinery factory "China Machinery Factory."
    However, before the money for building the factory was fully raised, the "July 7th Incident" occurred, and soon the preparatory office was dissolved.
    From the Initial Establishment in Liuzhou to the Re-Destruction in Chongqing
    Just as these national capitalists were giving up on the idea of building a textile machinery factory, another capitalist, Li Shengbo, who had been engaged in the textile industry in Nantong and Shanghai, began planning to build a textile machinery manufacturing factory. This factory was the "Jingwei Textile Machinery Manufacturing Company." The company's signboard was hung up in Panshi, Liuzhou City, Guangxi Province, in 1943, but the only products that came out of the "Jingwei Textile Machinery Manufacturing Company" were a few parts needed for textile machinery—spindles and rollers.
    Just one year after "Jingwei" was born, the Japanese invaders invaded Guangxi, and "Jingwei" had to follow its boss, Li Shengbo, and flee to Guizhou in a panic. Li Shengbo had just settled his meager "family fortune" in Dushan when the Japanese invaders' artillery fire followed, and "Jingwei" was engulfed in flames. Li Shengbo had to carry the company's empty signboard and flee to Chongqing.
    Soon after arriving in Chongqing, the signboard of "Jingwei Textile Machinery Manufacturing Company" appeared on Hualongqiao Street in Chongqing. However, at that time, "Jingwei" only had five or six machine tools.
    From "American Aid" to Bureaucratic Capital
    The Anti-Japanese War was won, and Li Shengbo, who had been battered and exhausted, knew that he was no longer able to restore the factory. Therefore, he turned to bureaucratic capital—the Bank of Communications. The pseudo-Bank of Communications put forward a condition: investment was possible, but "Jingwei" had to first find 1.5 million US dollars of capital before the pseudo-Bank of Communications would be willing to invest 1.5 million US dollars.
    Where could Li Shengbo find 1.5 million US dollars? He found the Export-Import Bank of the United States, hoping to beg for a loan. The Export-Import Bank of the United States initially said it wanted to see the factory construction plan, but later simply said, "China can buy machines from the United States if it needs them!"
    Unable to borrow "American aid," and with bureaucratic capital refusing to invest, "Jingwei," which had moved back to Shanghai from Chongqing, couldn't even support the lives of ten people. At this time, Li Shengbo had a stroke of genius: he bought an iron wire factory sold at a cheap auction and used the pulling of iron wire to maintain "Jingwei's" signboard and structure.
    Just as "Jingwei" was declining and on its last breath, the pseudo-Bank of Communications suddenly decided to give Li Shengbo 1.5 million US dollars. This was already the autumn of 1948. Li Shengbo used this money to order a batch of machines from the United States and, at the same time, found a piece of public land in Hangzhou and began preparations for construction. However, 1.5 million US dollars was not enough to build a factory with an annual output of 150,000 spindles of ring spinning and roving frames. The machinery Li Shengbo had ordered could not be shipped back; only a warehouse was built in Hangzhou. By the time Shanghai and Hangzhou were liberated in 1949, "Jingwei" was on the verge of paralysis, unable to live and unable to die.
    The True Birth of "Jingwei"
    The name "Jingwei" traveled tens of thousands of miles in old China, experiencing countless misfortunes. Its true birth only became a reality in the new China after liberation.
    Shanghai and Hangzhou were liberated, and the People's Government took over this name and some machines left by bureaucratic capital. It decided to complete what the national capitalists had not completed and could not have achieved in old China. In 1950, preparations began, and after only about a year of preparation, the Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory officially broke ground in the western suburbs of Yuci City, Shanxi Province, in May 1951. From the Northeast to the Northwest, from North China to South China, engineering and technical personnel and workers from all corners of the motherland flocked to the construction site. Trains loaded with the latest machines from the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, and Czechoslovakia also arrived at the construction site.
    New China is not stingy in developing its own independent industry. The state invested more than 45 million yuan in the Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory.
    "Jingwei," which had not been built in more than ten years in old China, was built in the new China at the fastest speed, in just three years and two months. Moreover, this "Jingwei" was more than four times larger than the historical "Jingwei." It can produce 800,000 spindles of roving and ring spinning frames in one year.
    "Jingwei's" Products are All Over the Country
    In the two years and ten months after it was put into production, the Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory has produced thirteen new types of textile machinery that China has never produced before. The total number of machines produced has reached 2,726, of which more than 2,300 have been installed in many textile factories across the country and put into production. Textile machinery marked "Jingwei product" can be seen in twenty-one textile factories and twelve schools and research departments from Mudanjiang in the east to Baoji in the west, from Changshu in the south to the capital in the north, and even in our neighboring country, Burma.
    This year, the Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory is producing products beyond the Five-Year Plan, because its Five-Year Plan was completed one year and eight days ahead of schedule last year. In the first half of the year, the factory produced more than 500 roving frames, ring spinning frames, and other seven types of textile machinery.
    New China is never satisfied with its achievements. The Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory is shouldering the arduous task of catching up with the world's advanced levels and is researching and experimenting with a ring spinning frame called "super-large draft." This is a top technology in the modern textile industry. People can foresee that in the near future, New China will build its textile factories that do not need roving frames.
    The twenty-year transformation of "Jingwei" is written here. The old worker who entrusted me to write this report also asked me to bring a question to the readers' attention. The original question was: "Some people say that New China is 'very bad.' Please everyone judge, what era and what things are very bad?"

### “经纬”二十年

    “经纬”二十年
  　莎荫
    最近，我访问了新中国成立以后最早建设的一座现代化的大工厂——经纬纺织机械厂。去的时候，正遇上数千名职工进行反右派斗争。本来打算把斗争情况写一则新闻，可是，一位素不相识的老工人找到我，向我提这样一个要求：把经纬机械厂二十年的变迁写一写。
    遥想二十年前……
    二十多年前，就是抗日战争爆发以前，中国的纺织工业已经有了五十多年的历史了。但是，纺织机械制造业在那时还是个“○”。上海有些资本家想把这个“○”补起来。当时，这些民族资本家们认为办一个年产五万纱锭的纺织机械厂，不仅有可能，而且生意也不会坏，于是就让曾在美国纺织机械厂实习过的黄朴奇负责筹备。他们把这个想像中的纺织机械厂定名为“中国机械厂”。
    然而建厂的钱还没有凑足，“七七”事变了，不久，筹备处也解散了。
    从柳州初创到重庆复灭
    正当这些民族资本家们放下办纺织机械厂的打算的时候，另一个曾经在南通、上海搞纺织工业的资本家李升伯却开始筹划办一个纺织机械制造厂。这个厂就是“经纬纺织机械制造公司”。公司的招牌1943年在广西省柳州市的磐石挂起来，但是从“经纬纺织机械制造公司”出来的产品，不过是纺织机械上所需要的几种零件——锭子和罗拉。
    “经纬”刚刚诞生一年以后，日寇便侵入了广西，“经纬”不得不跟着它的老板李升伯慌慌张张地逃到贵州。李升伯刚刚把他那微薄的“家产”在独山安顿就绪，日寇的炮火便跟踪而来，“经纬”就陷于大火。李升伯不得不背上公司的一块空招牌流亡到重庆。
    到重庆不久，“经纬纺织机械制造公司”的招牌便出现在重庆化龙桥大街上。不过，那时的“经纬”已经只有五六台工作母机了。
    从“美援”到官僚资本
    抗日战争胜利了，碰得焦头烂额的李升伯知道自己再也无力恢复这个厂子了，于是便投奔了官僚资本——交通银行。伪交通银行向他提出了一个条件：要投资可以，但是“经纬”必须先找到一百五十万美金的资本，伪交通银行才肯投入一百五十万美金。
    李升伯到哪里去找一百五十万美金呢？他找到了美国的进出口银行，想乞求一笔贷款。美国进出口银行开始说要看建厂计划，后来干脆说：“中国需要机器可以到美国买！”
    “美援”借不到，官僚资本不给投入，从重庆搬回上海的“经纬”连十个人的生活也维持不住了，这时，李升伯急中生智，就买了一座廉价拍卖的铁丝工厂，用拉铁丝来维持“经纬”的招牌和架子。
    正当“经纬”日薄西山、气息奄奄的时候，伪交通银行突然决定把一百五十万美金交给李升伯。这已经是1948年的秋天了。李升伯就用这笔钱向美国订购了一批机器，同时，在杭州找到了一片公地，开始了筹建工作。但是，一个年产十五万纱锭的细纱和粗纱机的工厂，一百五十万美金是建设不起来的。李升伯已订购的机械不能运回；在杭州也只建了一幢仓库。到1949年上海、杭州解放的时候，“经纬”已濒于求生不能、求死不得的瘫痪状态中。
    “经纬”的真正诞生
    “经纬”这个名字，在旧中国旅行了几万里，经历了数不清的厄运，它的真正的诞生只是在解放以后的新中国才成为现实。
    上海、杭州解放，人民政府接收了官僚资本留下来的这个名称和一些机器。决定把民族资本家在旧中国没有完成也不可能实现的事情办完。在1950年便开始了筹备工作，经过短短一年左右的准备，经纬纺织机械厂便在1951年5月在山西榆次市西郊正式破土动工了。从东北到西北、从华北到华南，来自祖国各个角落里的工程技术人员、工人拥到了工地上，火车满载着来自苏联、德意志民主共和国和捷克斯洛伐克的最新机器也开到了工地。
    新中国在发展自己独立的工业上是不吝啬的，国家给经纬纺织机械厂投资四千五百多万元。
    在旧中国十多年中没有建成的“经纬”，在新中国以最快的速度，在短短三年又两个月的时间里建成了，而且这个“经纬”比历史上的“经纬”大了四倍多，它能在一年中产八十万纱锭的粗纱和细纱机。
    “经纬”的产品遍布全国
    经纬纺织机械厂在它投入生产后的两年又十个月中，已经生产了我国从来没有生产过的十三种新型的纺织机械，生产的总数量达到两千七百二十六台，其中两千三百多台已经在全国的许多纺织厂里安装起来并投入了生产。标志着“经纬出品”的纺织机械在东至牡丹江、西至宝鸡、南至常熟、北至首都的二十一个纺织厂和十二个学校、研究部门中都可以看到，在我们的邻邦——缅甸也可以看到。
    今年，经纬纺织机械厂正在生产着五年计划以外的产品，因为它的五年计划在去年就提前一年零八天完成了。上半年，全厂又生产了五百多台粗纱机、细纱机等七种纺织机械。
    新中国从来就不满足于自己的成就。经纬纺织机械厂肩负着向世界先进水平看齐的艰巨任务，正在研究和试验着一种叫“超大牵伸”的细纱机，这是现代纺织工业上的头等技术，人们可以预见，在不久将来，新中国就会把它的不要粗纱机的纺织厂盖起来。
    “经纬”二十年的变迁就写到这里了。那位委托我写这则报道的老工人还要我把一个问题提到读者面前，原问题是这样问的：“有人说新中国‘糟得很’，请大家评评，究竟什么时代，什么事情糟得很？”
