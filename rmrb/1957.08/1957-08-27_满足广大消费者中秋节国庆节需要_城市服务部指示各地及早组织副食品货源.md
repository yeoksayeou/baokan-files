Xinhua News Agency, August 26th. To meet the needs of the broad masses of consumers during the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day, the Urban Services Department has instructed service departments in all localities to immediately organize supplies and properly arrange the supply of non-staple foods for the holidays.

The instructions require service departments in all localities to make efforts to purchase pigs during the current small peak season for pig acquisition and complete the allocation plan. In terms of supply, they should reduce the daily supply somewhat and increase the supply during the holidays, based on the available supply. The supply of beef and mutton is not sufficient, and it is necessary to ensure the supply to the Hui people during the holidays. Around the Mid-Autumn Festival, more attention should be paid to arranging the supply work to rural areas.

The instructions state: Currently, the demand for sugar exceeds the supply. The Service Department has studied this with the Ministry of Food Industry, and localities can consider saving some sugar from the production of fruit candies to supply to residents during the holidays.

Regarding the supply of Mid-Autumn Festival mooncakes, the Service Department has specifically instructed all localities to select and produce a variety of products in combination with local consumption habits, and to maintain and promote special flavors.

The instructions also put forward precautions for the supply of poultry, fresh eggs, vegetables, dried vegetables, fruits, and tobacco and alcohol needed for the holidays, and to think of all ways to meet the needs of the masses.

　  满足广大消费者中秋节国庆节需要
　　城市服务部指示各地及早组织副食品货源
    据新华社26日讯　中秋节和国庆节即将到来，城市服务部指示各地服务部门立即组织货源，妥善安排好节日的副食品供应工作。
    指示要求各地服务部门趁目前生猪收购还是小旺季的时候，努力收购，完成调拨计划；在供应方面，要根据货源情况，在平日少供应一些，增加节日的供应量。牛、羊肉货源不充裕，必须保证节日对回民的供应。在中秋节前后，对农村的供应工作要更加注意安排好。
    指示提出：当前食糖是供不应求的，服务部已经同食品工业部研究，各地可考虑从水果糖的生产中节余出一些食糖在节日供应居民。
    关于中秋月饼的供应问题，服务部曾专门指示各地应结合当地消费习惯，选制多样品种，保持和发扬特殊风味。
    指示对于供应节日需要的家禽、鲜蛋、蔬菜、干菜、水果、烟酒都提出了注意事项，要想一切办法适应群众的需要。
