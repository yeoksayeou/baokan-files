    Ma Zhemin Masterminded the "Little Hungary Incident"
    The Truth of the Hanyang County No. 1 Middle School Incident
    By our reporter Cao Baoming
    On June 12th and 13th, under the instigation of Ma Zhemin, a high-ranking member of the Zhang-Luo alliance stationed in Wuhan, the anti-revolutionary group led by Yang Huanyao, the head of the Hanyang County Democratic Parties United Group and member of the China Democratic League, and Wang Jianguo, a prospective member of the China Democratic League and vice-principal of Hanyang County No. 1 Middle School, created what they called a "Little Hungary Incident" in Cai Dian Town, where the Hanyang County government was located. Exploiting the students' desire for further education and their lack of political experience, they organized over eight hundred students to strike and march, vandalizing the Hanyang County People's Committee and the Chinese Communist Party County Committee offices, and kidnapping and beating cadres. They also plotted to attack the power plant, seize weapons, and raid the prison, with the aim of expanding the incident.

    Wang Jianguo's Anti-Revolutionary Group
    This riot was an organized activity that Yang Huanyao and Wang Jianguo's anti-revolutionary group had been preparing for a long time, after receiving secret instructions from the Ma Zhemin group, the representatives of the Zhang-Luo alliance in Wuhan.

    Wang Jianguo's family were reactionary rich peasants and were struggled against by the peasants during the land reform. He himself had participated in the Three People's Principles Youth League. After liberation, he infiltrated the Communist Youth League. Later, he was transferred to Hanyang County No. 1 Middle School as vice-principal. In 1953, Wang Jianguo organized a reactionary group in the school, with Yang Songtao, Zhong Yuwen, Zhang Liangshao, and others as its core members. These people were all anti-revolutionaries who had worked for Kuomintang secret agents after liberation. This reactionary group used insidious methods to corrupt the students' minds. Wang Jianguo openly told students, "The future of students is six big characters: Money, fame, status!" Zhong Yuwen even swore brotherhood with students in the ninth class of the third grade of junior high school, treating them to drinks and cigarettes, and introducing them to lovers. As a result, discipline among students was lax, and their thinking was confused. Very young students engaged in illicit love affairs, and some even committed suicide by jumping into the river due to love disputes.

    Wang Jianguo's reactionary group also carried out anti-communist, anti-Soviet, and pro-American, fear-American education among the students. Therefore, at the beginning of the riot, students posted 140 reactionary slogans such as "Welcome Chiang Kai-shek back" and "Go to Taiwan."

    The Ma Zhemin Group Colluded with Them
    This April, Yang Huanyao came to the school to incite trouble, further fueling the ambitions of Wang Jianguo's reactionary group, who began to prepare for a frenzied attack on the Party and the people.

    Yang Huanyao was a historical counter-revolutionary. This February, Yang Huanyao went to Wuchang to participate in the Democratic League's provincial conference of League members' representatives. Lu Mingqiu, a close associate of Ma Zhemin, told him, "The plan you proposed for developing the organization in Hanyang County is representative. Xiao Tianmin of Xishui developed eleven people at once and has now been elected to the Provincial League Committee." Ma Zhemin also said at the symposium, "It is possible to develop organizations in other counties. Now the development of organizations is approved by the Provincial League, so development can be faster." After Yang Huanyao returned to the county, he privately found a list of teachers who graduated from colleges and universities at Hanyang County No. 1 Middle School and personally sent it to the Provincial League Committee. Afterwards, Yang Huanyao went to Wuchang several times to receive instructions from the Ma Zhemin group and brought back more than ten copies of the "Work Briefing" that Ma Zhemin specially used to introduce his experience in inciting trouble. Lu Mingqiu also asked Yang Huanyao, "How is the airing of views going at No. 1 Middle School now?" Yang said, "It can be done, but it hasn't started yet." After Yang Huanyao colluded with Wang Jianguo's reactionary group in April, he told these people, "The province has decided to focus on Hanyang County, and No. 1 Middle School is the focus of the focus." He also made specific arrangements: Wang Jianguo would be the person in charge of the Democratic League branch in No. 1 Middle School, Hu Pingxuan, deputy director of the Bureau of Culture and Education, would be the person in charge of the County Democratic League, and he himself would work in the Provincial Democratic League in the future. After the reactionary remarks of Zhang Bojun, Chu Anping, and Ma Zhemin were published in the newspapers, he told this group of people, "Our leaders have spoken." He also encouraged them, "If we don't have power, we must fight for it." Wang Jianguo's reactionary group saw that the Democratic League supported them and learned the experience of starting trouble from the "Work Briefing" run by Ma Zhemin, so they openly promoted "great democracy" to the students and prepared to make trouble.

    Actively Cultivating Students' "Spontaneous Fighting Spirit"
    When Wang Jianguo conveyed Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference, he deliberately distorted it, saying that "student unrest is inevitable, it is a natural law, and it cannot be stopped once it starts." His accomplices Yang Songtao, Zhong Yuwen, and others spread these fallacies among the students. Then, Wang Jianguo stopped political classes and lectured specifically on how he had participated in parades and demonstrations in the past. Yang Songtao and others also introduced the experience of strikes and marches in class. On May 4th, the students of Class 9, Grade 3, held an evening party, and Zhong Yuwen specifically introduced how students in the past opposed the rulers, went on strike, and marched, and how heroic the struggle was, proposing to "carry forward the May Fourth tradition." He also taught the students to sing songs that students sang before liberation when they fought against the Kuomintang reactionaries. At the "May Day" sports meeting, Yang Songtao and others deliberately created refereeing errors and took the opportunity to incite students to make trouble, saying that this was "cultivating the students' spontaneous fighting spirit." Under their cultivation, some students could make a fuss about such small things as eating bowls of rice, and every time they clamored for a strike.

    Secret Meetings in Teahouses
    At this time, this group of reactionary elements, composed of Yang Huanyao, Wang Jianguo, and Hu Pingxuan, formed a three-person group to prepare to make trouble. At that time, according to the arrangements of higher authorities, the school decided to convene a student representative meeting to focus on labor education, strengthen political education, and promote democracy to improve work. Yang Huanyao and the other three believed that "the student union is a good opportunity to seize power." On the evening of June 2nd, they held a secret meeting in a teahouse and decided to tamper with the nature of the student representative meeting, turning it into a meeting specifically for making criticisms of the leadership and attacking the Party branch. Yang Huanyao also specifically arranged: "Principal Wang should control this meeting through the Democratic League's development targets, and Director Hu should support Principal Wang. However, Director Hu should not express his attitude on the most sensitive issues." Speaking of the method of selecting representatives, Yang firmly advocated: "Select mischievous students and those who dare to make criticisms. In case our opinions cannot be raised, train the representatives in advance." Then, he analyzed the situation and said: "If the meeting deteriorates and trouble breaks out, Principal Wang will take control through various channels, Director Hu will express a negative attitude, and I will mobilize the students outside. Let the students make trouble as much as they want."

    After the meeting, Wang Jianguo and Hu Pingxuan changed the nature of the student representative meeting and the method of selecting representatives through Yang Songtao, Zhang Liangshao, and Zhong Yuwen. They also used methods such as receiving student representatives and talking to students individually to instigate students to specifically make criticisms and attack the Party branch. Zhang Anjian, a member of this reactionary group, even threatened Principal Han Jianxun, saying, "If you act arbitrarily, you will be deserted by everyone before the meeting and be surrounded by enemies after the meeting!" The student representative meeting opened on June 8th. As soon as the meeting started, more than 300 criticisms were raised against the Party's leadership, demanding that Han Jianxun return to the countryside, that Wang Jianguo be appointed as the principal, and that all five Party members in the school withdraw from the school. Some students even openly said, "If these problems are not solved, we will stage a Little Hungary incident!" Zhong Yuwen encouraged them from behind, saying, "If the problem is not solved, trouble may break out on Wednesday."

    Sure enough, on Wednesday (June 12th), they used the "enrollment ratio issue" they had created to incite the students.

    This anti-revolutionary group also conducted organizational division of labor, determining who was responsible for contacting their accomplices and who was directing the students behind the scenes. They also sent students Xu Siwu, Fan Xianshi, and others to participate in the student group to take the lead in making trouble and report the situation to them at any time. A "Little Hungary incident" broke out under the instigation of this demonic group.

    Using the Enrollment Issue to Spread Rumors and Incite Trouble
    This summer, Hanyang County No. 1 Middle School had nine junior high school graduating classes, totaling 459 students, who were very concerned about further education.

    On the morning of the 12th, near the end of the last class, chemistry teacher Li Sui spread rumors in the fourth class of the third grade, saying, "This year's enrollment is very small, only one or two out of twenty people will be admitted. Your class's grades are not good, so at most two people will be admitted." Upon hearing this, the students became agitated. This news immediately spread among the nine classes of the third grade, and everyone discussed it. At this time, Yang Songtao, one of the members of this anti-revolutionary group and the deputy director of studies, went to the fourth, sixth, seventh, and other classes of the third grade to instigate students to make noise and demand to see the relevant documents from the principal. Principal Han Jianxun (a Party member) told the students, "I don't have the documents, but I have the meeting minutes." Han Jianxun immediately showed the meeting minutes to the students. However, Yang Songtao said to the students, "They won't show the documents, isn't this deceiving the students?" causing the students to demand to see the documents and make a scene. At that time, the deputy minister of the County Party Committee's Culture and Education Department immediately called the Commissioner's Office for instructions and confirmed that the enrollment ratio for the entire area this year was 26.3%, and came to explain to the students. However, Hu Pingxuan (a prospective member of the Democratic League and a member of this anti-revolutionary group), deputy director of the County Bureau of Culture and Education, deliberately told the students, "The province has decided that it is about 30%, and it should not be less than 5% at the very least." Upon hearing the statement that it should be no less than 5%, the students became even more annoyed. Immediately, strike slogans were posted in all nine classes of the third grade. Some of them read: "Down with Zhang (Zhang Xiruo), capture the Culture and Education Department's dog egg alive!"

    At this time, some students asked Yang Songtao, "Will we make a mistake by doing this?" Yang said, "This is righteous and will not be a mistake." Some teachers also wrote slogans: "Support your just actions!" "Fight for the right to be educated!" With this, the students became even more enthusiastic. Some students immediately rang the bell to gather and demanded to go to the County People's Committee to see the documents. They also collectively shouted to the high school students and threw stones at the classrooms of the first and second grades of junior high school, also coaxing out the students of the third class of the first grade of high school and the students of the first and second grades of junior high school. Principal Han Jianxun wanted to convene an emergency meeting of teachers to discuss how to dissuade them, but he could not convene it. The students poured out of the school in a riot.

    At first glance, this seemed to be students making trouble for the sake of further education, but as soon as the students took to the streets, some students posted and shouted reactionary slogans such as "Welcome the Kuomintang back," "Welcome Chiang Kai-shek back," and "Go to Taiwan." A large Kuomintang party emblem was also drawn on the school grounds. The nature of the matter was clearly exposed.
  The counter-revolutionary tail was revealed from the beginning

    When they arrived at the County People's Committee, they first rushed into the Bureau of Culture and Education to smash things and rummage through documents, then rushed to other offices to smash and make trouble, breaking the door of the county magistrate's office. They wrote at the door of County Magistrate Han Maolin's dormitory: "Hypocritical county magistrate, running dog of the Beast Central!" "You guys who eat and do nothing, get off the stage!" and so on.

    At this time, some students at the County People's Committee called the neighboring No. 2 Middle School and No. 3 Middle School, asking them to also go on strike in response; when they couldn't get through, they destroyed the telephone. Some students snatched three bicycles from the County People's Committee and rode them to the countryside. Yang Huanyao, who was hiding in a nearby grocery store, then incited the students to say: "Go to the post office and beat them!" The students swarmed to the post office, and the post office workers surrounded the switchboard room, preventing them from getting close to the switchboard.

    At this time, teacher Wang Shaoping came forward to ask the cadres to find the county magistrate, saying: "If you don't find the county magistrate, the students will not leave." The students then put forward three requests: 1. Announce the enrollment ratio; 2. Unified national enrollment; 3. The enrollment ratio between urban and rural areas should be consistent. However, when Deputy County Magistrate Li came out to answer, they didn't listen, and when the County Party Committee sent the Minister of Propaganda and others to explain, they didn't listen either. A student shouted: "The leaders are all in the County Party Committee!" The students swarmed to the County Party Committee again.

    As soon as the students arrived at the County Party Committee, they rushed into the offices and smashed and made trouble. Some students even rushed to rob the archives in the Organization Department, but were stopped by cadres. The students also turned over the County Party Committee's sign and wrote: "Use revolutionary means to overthrow counter-revolutionaries!"

    Kidnapping Cadres Twice
    At this time, Major Shangguan Mingxian, director of the conscription bureau living nearby, rushed to dissuade the students, saying: "Reactionary slogans have been found, you must be vigilant!" Hu Ziqiao, a cadre of the County Communist Youth League Committee, also explained: "Don't be fooled by counter-revolutionaries!" The students suddenly became agitated: "What? You say we are counter-revolutionaries!" Immediately took out ropes from their pockets and tied up Hu Ziqiao and sent him to the school.

    When the students were eating dinner, someone said: "Director Shangguan said that Hanyang County No. 1 Middle School is a den of counter-revolutionaries." Yang Songtao took the opportunity to incite: "If they say we are counter-revolutionaries, we will go to him and make it clear!" And incited the students to say: "If you can't catch him, you have to get his gun back!" The students immediately swarmed to the conscription bureau. Finding that Shangguan was not there, someone immediately pointed to the armory upstairs and said: "He is hiding inside!" The students swarmed toward the armory, but were stopped by the cadres. At this time, some students saw Shangguan at the County Party Committee, and with a shout, swarmed to the County Party Committee again, dragging Shangguan out. As soon as they arrived at the school, teacher Yu Xinping hugged Shangguan around the waist from behind, while the students shouted around him to hand over his gun. Shangguan said: "I never carry a gun on my body." And firmly stated: "I support your just demands; I will not support your wrong demands, even if you kill me." The students locked Shangguan in the garden.

    In the evening, the County Party Committee sent a dozen cadres to persuade the students to release Director Shangguan and others, and at the same time convened an emergency meeting of teachers, announced the enrollment ratio, and asked the teachers to persuade the students not to make any more trouble. However, Yang Huanyao, the behind-the-scenes director outside the school, secretly contacted Wang Jianguo, the director inside the school, at about 5:00 PM. Yang Huanyao told them to make trouble in an organized and led manner. Wang Jianguo also had a meeting with Zhang Liangshao (deputy director of studies) and Yang Songtao in their group. They believed that the Democratic League supported them from the outside, so they decided to continue the organized and led actions the next day. Then, Zhang Liangshao convened a meeting of class teachers to convey this intention. Therefore, when the school convened an emergency meeting of teachers to convey the County Party Committee's measures to strive for resumption of classes, Yang Songtao, Zhang Liangshao, Yu Xinping, Wang Shaoping, and others privately left the meeting place and went to the classrooms and dormitories to agitate: "Your actions are just, but you didn't organize it well today, so you have to make trouble in an organized manner tomorrow." "Go to bed early tonight so you can make trouble tomorrow." Wang Jianguo also went to the students to agitate them after the meeting.

    On the morning of the 13th, large slogans were posted on the school blackboard: "Students in Wuhan City have achieved victory in their strike, and the number of enrollment places has increased by more than 10,000, from 30% to more than 50%. We have been reduced from 26.3% to 5%. Is it reasonable for the government to handle it this way? We must resolutely take action to oppose it!" After breakfast, the students of the ninth class of the third grade first lined up and circled the school once, shouting to the students of each class to come out, scolding the students who refused to participate as "traitors" and "shameless," and said: "Whoever dares to object will be taught a lesson with fists!" As a result, except for the first, second, and fourth classes of the first grade of high school, more than 800 students in the school went on strike and took to the streets. Many students also bought new ropes, ready to tie people up.

    Several Attempts to Tie Up the County Magistrate
    The students arrived at the County People's Committee. County Magistrate Han Maolin received their representatives. County Magistrate Han criticized them for exceeding the scope of democracy in their actions yesterday, and that writing reactionary slogans, destroying public property, and kidnapping cadres were all wrong. The student representatives then made a noise below. County Magistrate Han answered their request, saying: "The enrollment ratio is definitely 26.3%. The issue of unified national enrollment cannot be resolved by Hanyang County. You can reflect your opinions to the higher levels, but I want to explain to you." At this time, Yang Songtao incited the students outside to tie up the county magistrate. The students rushed in several times, but were blocked by the cadres standing around the county magistrate. After the county magistrate answered, several representatives were satisfied, but some student representatives said: "We cannot represent all the students, you go out and answer." As soon as County Magistrate Han moved, the students gathered around, secretly hitting him and pushing him to the ground. At this time, the cadres came to help the county magistrate, and the students pointed at the cadres and scolded: "You are the county magistrate's lackeys!" "You are hitting the students!" The students behind threw ropes, and the students in front tied up the cadres, immediately tying up three cadres including Teng Liangzhi.

    After County Magistrate Han repeated what he had said to the student representatives to all the students, the students had no objections and prepared to disperse. However, Wang Jianguo secretly sent Xu Siwu (a student), whom he had cultivated to be good at making trouble, to jump on a bench and incite everyone to demand that County Magistrate Han lead the students to the province to petition.

    Rushing into the County Party Committee to Beat Cadres
    At this time, Wang Dacai, a cook at the County Party Committee, met two students on the street who were holding cadre Zhu Jiacheng's neck and dragging him to the school. Wang Dacai immediately told the students to let go. The students refused, and he pulled the students' hands away and let Zhu go. A student came forward to grab him, and Wang Dacai pulled the student into the County Party Committee. Some students ran to the County People's Committee and shouted: "Comrades, the County Party Committee has tied up three of our classmates and is hanging them up and beating them!" The students immediately swarmed to the County Party Committee. At that time, the County Party Committee had already released the student. However, Yang Songtao shouted to the students: "Rush in!" Wang Jianguo also shouted: "The actions of the students are just!" The students rushed in with all their strength. Breaking through the gate of the County Party Committee, they beat the cadres they saw. The students beat cadre Li Bangzhen unconscious, with limbs twitching; they tied up cadre Chen Jikui, leaving blood marks all over his body; the students grabbed cadre Ding Yuqiao's hair, pressed him to the ground, and punched and kicked him. At this time, Xu Siwu, a student sent by Wang Jianguo, whistled upstairs, and Yang Songtao shouted below: "Tie up the secretary!" Some students forced County Party Secretary Zhao Lianji into a corner, preparing to tie him up and beat him. At this most tense moment, hundreds of workers rushed into the County Party Committee.

    Workers and Peasants Rise Up to Fight Back
    Originally, workers and peasants were very dissatisfied with the students' rioting on the 12th. Students who went to the countryside to carry out propaganda asked the peasants to support them. The peasants scolded them: "You are full and don't study peacefully, but only do bad things!" On the evening of the 12th, while the students were tying up Director Shangguan, they posted reactionary slogans on the glory list of all the workers in the town. The workers then gathered spontaneously to stop the students' illegal behavior and maintain social order. At that time, after the chairman of the trade union persuaded them, the workers sent 20 representatives to the school to negotiate, asking the school to tear down the reactionary slogans on the glory list and stop the students from making trouble. On the afternoon of the 13th, when the workers heard that the students were tying up and beating cadres at the County Party Committee again, they automatically stopped production and gathered six or seven hundred people at once, determined to defend the organs and protect the leading comrades. At that time, the County Party Committee persuaded them not to come, but when the students were beating harder and harder, the workers guaranteed with their trade union membership: they would only mediate and not fight. So they rushed to the County Party Committee. Who knew that as soon as the workers' team arrived, the students pounced on them. The workers were angered and then vigorously pinched the arms of some students and dragged them out. Seeing that they would suffer if they beat people again, the students tied up five workers and seven cadres and retreated to the school.

    When the workers saw that the students had tied up their own people, they also rushed into the school. The neighboring peasants, hearing that the students were beating cadres at the County Party Committee, also shouted slogans such as "Support the Communist Party," "Support the People's Regime," and "Oppose the Illegal Behavior of the Students of No. 1 Middle School" and rushed into the town. At this time, workers, peasants, and students were all crowded in the school yard, and the situation was very tense. The county magistrate rushed to the school and asked everyone to sit down, send representatives to talk, and let the government be responsible for handling it; at the same time, he asked the school to release the tied-up workers and cadres. At this time, Yang Songtao incited the students in the crowd: "Tie up the county magistrate!" Tang Xinyu, a worker at the power plant, and Yi Guoqing, a worker at the oil factory, heard this and shouted: "The county magistrate is the county magistrate we elected, who dares to tie him up!" They grabbed Yang Songtao on the spot.

    At this time, the representatives of the workers and peasants held a meeting and put forward three demands: 1. Stop the students' illegal behavior; 2. Punish the murderers severely; 3. Resume classes immediately. The county magistrate accepted their demands. The student representatives knew they were in the wrong and did not dare to come forward.

    Counter-Revolutionaries Want to Kill Party Member Cadres in the School
    After the workers and peasants dispersed, rumors spread again in the school, saying, "146 students were beaten, and two are in mortal danger." "The County Party Committee hired workers to beat the students, and invited the workers to a meal in a restaurant." "The workers are paid three yuan a day for beating, and the peasants are paid three work points for a carrying pole." etc. At the same time, slogans were posted, calling for "the capture of the chief culprit Zhao Lianji (Secretary of the County Party Committee)." At this time, teacher Zhang Anjian also discussed with several students to use knives and iron thorns to kill Principal Han Jianxun and other Party members. After dinner, the students surrounded the office building again and tried to rush up to beat Han Jianxun and others several times. Student Tang Huimin even rushed up with a knife, but a teacher discovered it and took away his knife.

    A Conspiracy to Further Expand the Incident
    In the darkness of the night, Wang Jianguo and others organized dozens of students to hold knives, spears, and sticks, setting up sentries and imposing martial law, creating a tense atmosphere. Wang Jianguo also sent student Xu Siwu to hold a secret meeting with a dozen students, making "three resolutions and nine measures" to send representatives to petition in the province on foot, send students to the countryside to carry out propaganda, and insist on striking; demanding to "punish the chief culprit Zhao Lianji, and send him to Xinjiang to reclaim wasteland, and demote Han Maolin to a commoner"; at the same time, immediately writing a "Letter to the People of the Whole Country," "Letter to the Compatriots of Wuhan," "Appeal," and "Letter to the Hubei Daily." Zhang Liangshao immediately made mimeograph stencils for them and printed and distributed the "Appeal" and "Letter to the People of the Whole Country." Wang Jianguo also instructed Xu Siwu to ask the County People's Committee to issue a letter of introduction to petition in the province; if they didn't issue it, they would make trouble.

    That night, Yu Xinping also spread rumors, saying: "Three thousand Kuomintang troops have occupied Jurushan (about fifty miles away from Caidian), and the students of No. 1 Middle School have occupied the lower reaches of the Han River." The students were also preparing to rush into the County Broadcasting Station to broadcast to the whole county "the truth about the County Party Committee organizing workers to beat the students." They also conspired to attack the power plant; once the lights went out in the whole town, they would seize weapons and raid the prison. The workers at the power plant also discovered more than a dozen students with sticks moving around the factory. The workers then installed an electric grid and turned on the electricity. All organs and units also guarded through the night to prevent counter-revolutionaries from taking the opportunity to create a riot.

    On the morning of the 14th, the students asked Wang Jianguo to hold a meeting again, on the one hand sending students to the countryside to provoke the relationship between workers and peasants, and on the other hand preparing to hold a school-wide meeting in the afternoon to struggle against Han Jianxun, Zhou Bingxian, and others.

    The Truth Comes to Light, Resumption of Classes Begins
    At this time, Zhao Kejian, secretary general of the Prefectural Party Committee, and the County Party Committee had analyzed the nature of the incident and sent someone to find Wang Jianguo and seriously pointed out to him: "This has exceeded the scope of democracy and is a matter of the enemy and ourselves." In the afternoon, Zhao Kejian convened a general meeting of students and analyzed the facts of the counter-revolutionaries taking the opportunity to create riots at the meeting. The County Party Committee also sent a large number of cadres to the nearby villages to explain the truth of the incident and organized representatives from all walks of life to visit the scene. The County Judicial Organs also summoned and arrested Yang Songtao, the culprit who was found on the spot, at the request of the masses. The incident subsided, and the students began to resume classes.

    马哲民策动的“小匈牙利事件”
    汉阳县第一中学事件真相
    本报记者　曹葆铭
    6月12、13日，在章罗联盟驻武汉的大员马哲民的策动下，以汉阳县民主党派联合小组长、民盟盟员杨焕尧和民盟发展对象、汉阳县一中副校长王建国为首的反革命集团，在汉阳县机关所在地蔡甸镇制造了一次他们自称的“小匈牙利事件”。他们利用汉阳县一中学生要求升学而又缺乏政治经验的弱点，组织了八百多名学生罢课游行，捣毁县人民委员会和中共县委机关，捆架和殴打干部。他们还图谋打电厂、抢军火、劫监狱，扩大事件。
    王建国的反革命集团
    这次暴乱事件，是杨焕尧和王建国这个反革命集团接受了章罗联盟驻武汉专员——马哲民集团的秘密指示，作了长期准备的有组织的活动。
    王建国的家庭是反动富农，土改时被农民斗争了。他自己参加过三青团。解放后，他混进了青年团。后来调到汉阳县一中当副校长。1953年，王建国在学校组织了反动集团，骨干是杨松涛、钟毓文、张良绍等，这些人都是解放后为国民党特务作过工作的反革命分子。这个反动集团用毒辣的手段腐蚀学生的思想。王建国公开向学生讲：“学生的前途就是六个大字：金钱、名誉、地位！”钟毓文还在初中三年级第九班学生中拜把兄弟，请学生喝酒抽烟，替学生介绍爱人，结果学生中纪律松弛，思想混乱。年纪很小的学生就乱搞恋爱，有的还为恋爱纠纷跳水自杀。
    王建国反动集团还在学生中进行反共反苏和崇美恐美的教育。因此，在暴乱一开始，学生们就贴出了“欢迎蒋介石回来”，“到台湾去”等反动标语一百四十张。马哲民集团和他们勾上了
    今年4月，杨焕尧到学校点火，更使王建国反动集团野心勃勃，开始准备向党、向人民猖狂进攻。
    杨焕尧是历史反革命分子。今年2月，杨焕尧到武昌参加民盟全省盟员代表大会。马哲民的亲信陆鸣秋向他讲：“你提的在汉阳县发展组织的方案有代表性。浠水萧天民一次发展了十一人，现在已当选为盟省委委员。”马哲民也在座谈会上讲：“外县发展组织是可以的。现在发展组织由省盟批准，发展快些。”杨焕尧回到县里，就私自设法弄了一张汉阳县一中大专学校毕业的教员名单，亲自送到民盟省委。以后，杨焕尧又数次到武昌接受马哲民集团的指示，并带回马哲民专门用来介绍点火经验的“工作简报”十余份。陆鸣秋还问杨焕尧：“一中鸣放现在搞的怎样？”杨说：“搞是搞得起来，现在还没开始搞。”杨焕尧从4月同王建国反动集团勾结上以后，就向这些人讲：“省里决定以汉阳县为重点，一中又是重点的重点。”并具体安排：王建国作一中民盟支部的负责人，文教局副局长胡平轩作县民盟负责人，他自己将来要到省民盟工作。报上公布章伯钧、储安平、马哲民的反动言论后，他就向这群人讲：“我们的负责人发言了。”并鼓动他们：“我们没有权，就要争权。”王建国反动集团见民盟支持他们，又从马哲民办的“工作简报”中学到放火闹事的经验，便公开向学生进行搞“大民主”的宣传，准备闹事。
    积极培养学生的“自发斗争性”
    王建国传达毛主席在最高国务会议的讲话时，有意歪曲，说什么“学生闹事是不可避免的，是自然规律，闹起来也无法制止。”他的党羽杨松涛、钟毓文等又把这些谬论在学生中散布。接着，王建国又停止了政治课，专门在课堂上讲他过去如何参加游行示威。杨松涛等也在班上介绍罢课游行的经验。5月4日，三九班学生开晚会，钟毓文专门介绍过去的学生如何反对统治者罢课游行，斗争如何英勇，提出要“发扬五四传统”。他还教学生们唱解放前学生对国民党反动派进行斗争时的歌曲。在“五一”运动会上，杨松涛等故意制造裁判错误，借机煽动学生闹事，还说这是“培养学生的自发斗争性”。在他们的这样培养下，有些学生可以为了吃钵饭桶饭这样的小事不断起哄，而且每次都闹着要罢课。
    茶馆中的秘密会议
    这时，这群反动分子就由杨焕尧、王建国和胡平轩组成三人小组，准备闹事。当时，学校根据上级的布置，决定召开学生代表会，以劳动教育为中心，加强政治教育，并发扬民主，改进工作。杨焕尧等三人就认为“学生会是争权的好机会”。6月2日傍晚他们在一个茶馆里开了个秘密会，决定将学生代表会的性质篡改为专门向领导提意见，和打击党支部。杨焕尧还具体布置：“王校长要通过民盟发展对象将这次会掌握起来，胡局长要支持王校长。但在最尖锐的问题上，胡局长不要表示态度”。谈到代表产生办法，杨坚决主张：“选调皮的和敢提意见的学生。万一我们的意见提不出来，就把代表事前训练一下。”接着，他又分析形势说：“如果会开恶化了，闹起来了，由王校长通过各方面掌握，胡局长表示消极态度，我在外面发动学生。尽学生闹。”
    会后，王建国、胡平轩就通过杨松涛、张良绍、钟毓文把学生代表会的性质和代表产生办法改变了，并且用接见学生代表和同学生个别谈话的办法，唆使学生专门提意见攻击党支部，这个反动集团的张安建还威吓校长韩建勋说：“如果你一意孤行，会前是众叛亲离，会后是四面楚歌！”学生代表会在6月8日开幕，一开会就给党的领导提了三百多条意见，要韩建勋回到农村去，让王建国当正校长，要全校五个党员都退出学校。有的学生还公开讲：“这些问题不解决，我们就要搞小匈牙利事件！”钟毓文在背后鼓动说：“问题不解决，星期三就可能闹起来。”
    果然，星期三（6月12日），他们就利用自己制造的“招生比例问题”，把学生煽动起来。
    这个反革命集团又进行了组织分工，确定那些人负责联系他们的党羽，那些人在幕后指挥学生。他们还派遣了学生许斯武、范贤仕等五人参加到学生群里带头闹，并随时向他们汇报情况。一次“小匈牙利事件”，就在这个魔鬼集团的策动下暴发起来了。
    利用升学问题造谣点火
    汉阳县第一中学今年暑期初中有九个班四百五十九人毕业，学生们对升学非常关心。
    12日上午最后一节课快下堂，化学教员李穗在三年级第四班造谣说：“今年招生很少，二十个人中取个把。你们班成绩不好，顶多取两个。”学生一听，便哄了起来。这个消息立即在三年级九个班里传开了，大家议论纷纷。这时，这个反革命集团的成员之一、副教导主任杨松涛到三年级第四、六、七等班去唆使学生找校长哄闹，要看有关的文件。校长韩建勋（党员）向学生说：“我没有文件，但有会议记录。”韩建勋立即把会议记录给学生看了。杨松涛却在学生中说：“有文件不给看，这不是欺骗学生吗？”使学生扭着要看文件这事，大闹起来。当时，县委文教部副部长立即打电话向专署请示，肯定了全专区今年的招生比例是26.3％，赶来向学生作解释。而县文教局副局长胡平轩（民盟发展对象，也是这个反革命集团的成员）却故意向学生说：“省里决定是30％左右，最少不得少于5％。”学生听见了有不少于5％的说法，更为恼火。顿时在三年级九个班上都贴出了罢课的标语。其中有的写着：“打倒张贼（张奚若），活捉文教厅狗蛋！”
    这时，有的学生问杨松涛：“我们这样搞，会不会犯错误？”杨说：“这是正义的，不会犯错误。”有些教员也写出标语：“支持你们的正义行动！”“争取受教育的权利！”这一来，学生的劲头更大了。一些学生马上就打钟聚集起来，要到县人民委员会去找文件看。他们又集体向高中学生喊话，到初中一二年级教室旁边丢石子乱哄，把高中一年级第三班学生和初中一二年级的学生也哄出来了。校长韩建勋要召集教师紧急会议研究如何劝止，这时也召集不起来。学生们就乱哄哄地涌出学校了。
    乍一看，这好像是学生们为了升学而闹事，但学生们一上街，一些学生就贴出和喊出了“欢迎国民党回来”、“欢迎蒋介石回来”、“到台湾去”等反动标语和口号。学校地上也画了个很大的国民党党徽。事情的性质很明显地暴露出来
  了。开始就露出了反革命尾巴
    他们到了县人民委员会，首先冲进文教局打东西、翻文件，然后又拥到别的办公室乱打乱闹，把县长办公室的门也打破了。他们在县长韩茂林宿舍门口写着：“假道学的县长，兽中央的走狗！”“你们这些吃饭不做事的东西，滚下台来！”等等。
    这时，有的学生在县人民委员会打电话给邻近的二中、三中，要他们也罢课响应；没有摇通，便将电话机毁了。有些学生就抢了县人民委员会三辆脚踏车骑下乡去。暗藏在附近一家杂货店里的杨焕尧这时唆使学生说：“到邮电局去打！”学生们又拥到邮电局去，邮电局职工都围着总机房，不准他们挨近总机。
    这时，教员王少平出面要干部去找县长，说：“不找县长，学生不肯走。”学生这才提出了三个要求：一、公布招生比例；二、全国统一招生；三、城乡招生比例一致。但是，李副县长出来答复，他们不听，县委派宣传部长等来解释，他们也不听。有个学生喊了一句：“头头们都在县委会！”学生们又涌向县委会去了。
    学生们一到县委会，就冲进了各个办公室乱打乱闹。有的学生还冲去抢组织部里的档案，被干部拦住。学生们又把县委会的牌子反过来，写上：“以革命的手段打倒反革命！”
    两次捆架干部
    这时，住在邻近的兵役局长上官明显大尉赶来劝止学生说：“现在已发现反动标语，你们要提高警惕！”团县委干部胡子樵也解释说：“你们不要上了反革命的当！”学生顿时就哄起来：“什么？你说我们是反革命分子！”立即从兜里掏出绳子来，把胡子樵捆到学校去了。
    学生吃晚饭时有人说：“上官局长说县一中是反革命窝子。”杨松涛就趁机鼓动说：“说我们是反革命，我们去找他说清楚！”并且教唆学生说：“抓不到他的人，也要把他的枪拿回来！”学生马上就拥到兵役局去。找不见上官，顿时有人指着楼上军火库说：“他躲在这里面！”学生就往军火库拥，被干部们拦阻了。这时，有的学生在县委会看到上官，一声吆喝，又涌到县委会去，架着上官就往外拖。一到学校，教员余心平从身后拦腰一把将上官抱住，学生们则在周围喊着要他缴枪。上官说：“我身上从来不带枪。”并坚决表示：“你们正义的要求，我支持；你们错误的要求，杀了我的头，我也不支持。”学生就把上官关在花园里。
    晚上，县委派了十几个干部劝说学生把上官局长等人放了，同时召开教师紧急会议，公布招生比例，要教师劝止学生，不要再闹。但是，校外的幕后指挥者杨焕尧在下午五点钟左右就偷偷到学校和校内的指挥人王建国联系。杨焕尧要他们有组织有领导地闹。王建国又同他们集团中的张良绍（副教导主任）、杨松涛碰了一次头，他们认为外面有民盟支持，于是决定次日继续有组织有领导地行动。接着，张良绍召开班主任会，传达了这个意图。因此，当学校召集教师紧急会议，传达县委关于争取复课的措施时，杨松涛、张良绍、余心平、王少平等人都私自离开会场，分头到教室、寝室中去鼓动：“你们的行动是正义的，但今天没有组织好，明天要有组织地闹。”“你们今天早点睡，明天起来好闹。”王建国在会后也去学生中作了一番鼓动。
    13日早晨，学校黑板报上又贴出了大标语：“武汉市学生罢课取得了胜利，招生名额增加了一万多名，由30％增加到50％以上，把我们由26.3％降到5％。政府这样处理是合理的吗？我们要坚决行动起来反对！”早饭后，三年级第九班学生首先排队绕校一周，喊各班学生出来，大骂不肯参加的学生是“叛徒”、“无耻”，并说：“谁敢反对，拳头领教！”结果，全校除了高中一年级第一、二、四等三个班继续上课外，八百多名学生都停课上街了。有许多学生还买了新绳子，准备捆人。
    几次要捆县长
    学生们到了县人民委员会。县长韩茂林接见了他们的代表。韩县长批判他们昨天的行动已超越了民主的范围，写反动标语，捣毁公物，捆绑干部都是不对的。学生代表就在下面哄。韩县长答复他们的要求说：“招生比例肯定是26.3％。全国统一招生的问题，汉阳县不能解决。你们的意见可以向上级反映，但我要向你们解释。”这时候，杨松涛又在外面唆使学生捆县长。学生几次往里拥，都被站在县长周围的干部挡住了。县长作了答复以后，有几个代表已满意了，但有的学生代表说：“我们不能代表全体同学，你出去答复。”韩县长刚一动身，学生就围拢来，暗中打他并将他挤倒在地上。这时，干部来扶县长，学生们就指着干部骂：“你们是县长的狗腿子！”“你们打学生！”后面的学生就丢绳子，前面就捆干部，顿时捆走了滕良知等三个干部。
    当韩县长把他向学生代表讲的话向全体学生重讲了一遍后，学生们已经没有意见了，准备散去。王建国却暗中派遣他所培养起来的闹事能手许斯武（学生）跳上凳去煽动大家要求韩县长领着学生去省里请愿。
    冲进县委打干部
    就在这时候，县委会的炊事员王大才在街上碰见两个学生卡着干部朱家承的脖子往学校拖。王大才立即要学生松手。学生不答应，他便将学生的手拉开，放走了朱。有个学生上前夺，王大才就把这个学生拉进了县委会。有的学生就跑到县人民委员会喊道：“同学们，县委会捆了我们三个同学，在吊着打！”学生们立即涌向县委会。当时县委已经把这个学生放出去了。但是，杨松涛却叫学生：“冲进去！”王建国也高喊：“同学们的行动是正义的！”学生就一股劲往里冲。冲破了县委会的门，见了干部就打。学生们把干部李邦祯打晕了，四肢抽搐；把干部陈吉逵捆的浑身血印；学生们抓住干部丁玉乔的头发，压在地下，拳打脚踢。这时，王建国派遣的学生许斯武在楼上吹哨子，杨松涛在下面喊：“捆书记！”有的学生就把县委书记赵连吉逼到墙角，准备捆打。正在这最紧张的时候，有几百工人赶进县委会来了。
    工人农民起来反击
    本来，工人、农民在12日就对学生的暴乱行为很不满意。下乡宣传的学生要求农民支持他们。农民骂他们：“你们吃饱了，不安分念书，净干些坏事！”12日晚，学生在捆上官局长的同时，把反动标语贴在全镇工人的光荣榜上，工人便自动集会，要出面制止学生的违法行为，维持社会秩序。当时经工会主席劝说，工人推派了二十名代表到学校交涉，要学校撕掉光荣榜上的反动标语，并制止学生闹事。13日下午，工人听说学生又在县委会捆打干部，就自动停止生产，一下子聚集了六七百人，坚决要保卫机关，保护领导同志。当时，县委劝他们不要来，但当学生越打越厉害时，工人们便以工会会籍保证：只劝架，不动手。于是他们就赶到县委来了。谁知工人队伍一到，学生就扑打他们。工人们被激怒了，当时就使劲捏着一些学生的胳膊往门外拖。学生见再打人会吃亏，便捆了五个工人、七个干部退回学校去。
    工人们见学生捆走了自己人，也赶进了学校。邻近的农民听说学生在县委打干部，也喊着“拥护共产党”、“拥护人民政权”、“反对一中学生违法行为”等口号，赶进镇里来。这时，工人、农民、学生都拥在学校的院子里，情势非常紧张。县长连忙赶到学校，要大家坐下来，派代表谈，由政府负责处理；同时要学校把捆来的工人、干部放出来。这时，杨松涛又在人群中唆使学生：“把县长捆起来！”电厂工人唐新余、油厂工人易国清听见了，喊了声：“县长是我们选的县长，谁敢捆！”当场就把杨松涛抓住。
    这时，工人、农民的代表开会提出三个要求：一、制止学生违法行为；二、严办凶手；三、立即复课。县长接受了他们的要求。学生代表自知理屈，不敢出面。
    反革命分子要杀学校里的党员干部
    当工人、农民散去后，学校里又谣言蜂起，说什么“学生一百四十六人被打，二人有生命危险。”“县委雇工人打学生，请工人在餐馆吃了一顿。”“工人打一天三块钱，农民打一扁担三工分。”等等。同时贴出标语，要“捉拿总凶手赵连吉（县委书记）”。这时，教员张安建还同几个学生商量，要用刀子、铁刺，杀死校长韩建勋等党员。晚饭后，学生又包围办公楼，几次要冲上去打韩建勋等。学生汤惠民还手持刀子往上冲，一个教师发现了，夺下了他的刀子。
    进一步扩大事件的阴谋
    黑夜，王建国等又组织几十个学生手持刀子、标枪、棍棒，放哨戒严，造成紧张气氛。王建国又派学生许斯武同十几个学生开秘密会议，作出“三项决议、九项措施”，要派代表步行到省里请愿，派学生下乡宣传，并坚持罢课；要求“惩办总凶手赵连吉，叫他到新疆开荒，韩茂林削职为民”；同时立即写成“告全国人民书”、“告武汉同胞书”、“上诉书”和“给湖北日报的一封信”。张良绍马上给他们腊纸，将“上诉书”和“告全国人民书”印发出去了。王建国又指使许斯武，要他们找县人委开介绍信到省里请愿，不开就闹。
    这天夜里，余心平又造谣说：“国民党三千军队占领了侏儒山（离蔡甸约五十来里），一中学生占领汉江下游。”学生们也准备冲进县广播站，向全县广播“县委会组织工人打学生的真相”。他们还阴谋打电厂；等全镇电灯一灭，便抢军火、劫监狱。电厂工人也发现十多个持着棍棒的学生在工厂周围活动。工人们当时就安上电网，通上电流。各机关、单位也通宵守卫，防止反革命分子趁机制造暴动。
    14日早晨，学生又找王建国开会，一面派学生下乡挑拨工农关系，一面准备下午开全校大会，斗争韩建勋、周秉贤等人。水落石出，开始复课
    这时，地委秘书长赵克坚和县委已分析了这个事件的性质，派人把王建国找来，向他严重指出：“这已经超出了民主范围，是敌我问题。”下午，赵克坚召集学生开大会，在会上分析了反革命分子趁机制造暴乱的事实。县委又派了大批干部去附近各乡说明事件真相，并组织各界代表参观现场。县司法机关也在群众要求下，传讯和逮捕了当场发现的祸首杨松涛。事件平息下来了，学生开始复课。
