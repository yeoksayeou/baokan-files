Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 12th: The Indonesian Communist Party has achieved another major victory in the local council elections in Bandung, a historical city and the largest city in West Java. According to incomplete statistics obtained today by Jakarta's "People's Daily," in Bandung, the Indonesian Communist Party won more than 90,000 votes in the city council elections and more than 87,000 votes in the provincial council elections. In the 1955 general election, the Indonesian Nationalist Party, which received the most votes in Bandung, only received more than 50,000 votes in both the provincial and city council elections this time.

Jakarta's "Indonesian Torch" newspaper pointed out today that Western countries, especially the United States, are closely watching the local council elections on the island of Java, which accounts for more than five-eighths of the national population and is the political, economic, and cultural center of the country. Their performance reflects their concern about the victory of the Indonesian Communist Party in Java.

The newspaper also revealed that in Jakarta, several officials from the US Embassy visited some officials of the Indonesian government and talked about the victory of the Indonesian Communist Party.

"Indonesian Torch" said that the Indonesian government is currently paying attention to the possible impact of the Indonesian Communist Party's victory on foreign relations, because the government is working hard to secure foreign aid.
