    Beijing Hospital Changes Scope of Medical Services
    (Our Newspaper) The State Council has approved the Ministry of Health's proposal to immediately change the arrangements for high-ranking cadres' family members receiving outpatient and inpatient treatment at Beijing Hospital.
    Based on the State Council's instructions, the Ministry of Health issued a notice to all departments on July 26, stipulating that: high-ranking cadres' family members who originally sought medical treatment at Beijing Hospital, if they themselves are employed cadres, should seek medical treatment at the public medical hospitals of their work units in accordance with the public medical regulations they enjoy; cadres' family members who do not enjoy public medical treatment should go to district hospitals or choose their own hospitals for treatment, just like ordinary citizens, and they should be responsible for their own expenses. The Ministry of Health's notice also announced that the supplementary Beijing Hospital treatment cards originally issued to high-ranking cadres would be invalidated from August 12. In the future, any cadres or family members of cadres without Beijing Hospital treatment cards may go to Beijing Hospital for treatment if the doctor deems it necessary and the original work unit provides an introduction. Beijing Hospital shall admit patients for hospitalization based on their condition and bed availability, and all treatment will be subject to charges.

    北京医院改变医疗范围
    本报讯　国务院已批准了卫生部提出的立即改变高级干部家属在北京医院门诊及住院治疗的方案。
    卫生部根据国务院的指示已于7月26日向各部门发出了通知，通知中规定：原在北京医院就医的高干家属，如本人系在职干部，应按本人所享受之公费医疗规定，在所在工作机关的公费医疗医院看病；未享受公费医疗待遇的干部家属，应与市民一样到划区医院或者自己选择医院看病，费用都应该自己负责。卫生部通知中并宣布，原来发给各高级干部的北京医院诊疗证副证自8月12日起即行作废。今后凡无北京医院诊疗证的机关干部或家属，如医师认为必要经原机关介绍，可到北京医院看病。北京医院应当根据病情及床位情况收容住院，并且一律实行收费。
