Harbin (by this newspaper) - The 300,000 workers and over 10,000 health workers and primary and secondary school teachers in Harbin City have recently received a profound socialist education.

In mid-June, when the rightists were frantically attacking the Party, the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party conducted socialist propaganda and education for factory and enterprise workers and primary and secondary school teachers through various forms such as report meetings and symposiums. The Daowai District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held eight report meetings, with more than 8,000 people participating; the Municipal Committee also invited more than 200 responsible cadres from the Provincial Party Committee, ministers, etc., to give general reports to the city's workers. According to statistics, each worker heard an average of two or three reports, and some even heard four reports.

Through this large-scale socialist education movement, some people who previously had vague understandings also drew a clear line between themselves and the rightists. Many workers also proposed to work hard in production to counterattack the rightists. The workers of the Harbin Hardware Factory revised their production plan for the second half of the year, preparing to increase the production of more wealth to counterattack the rightists' attacks.

    哈尔滨市广大职工教员在反右派斗争中
    受到一次深刻的社会主义教育
    本报讯　哈尔滨市三十万名职工和一万多名卫生工作人员、中、小学教员，最近受到一次深刻的社会主义教育。
    6月中旬，当右派分子猖狂向党进攻的时候，中共哈尔滨市委员会就通过报告会、座谈会等各种形式向工厂企业的职工和中、小学校教员，进行了社会主义宣传教育。中共道外区委曾举行了八次报告会，有八千多人参加；市委还邀请中共省委书记、部长等负责干部二百多人，向全市的职工普遍作报告。据统计，平均每个职工都听到二、三次，有的甚至听到四次报告。
    经过这次大规模的社会主义教育运动，一些过去认识模糊的人，也和右派分子划清了界限。许多工人还提出要努力生产来反击右派分子。哈尔滨五金厂的工人修改了下半年的生产计划，准备增产更多的财富，回击右派分子的进攻。
