　　Zhang Fenglin's "Amateur Career"
　　One early summer morning, locomotives roared in the Shenyang Railway Station's marshalling yard. Some workers were playing ball on the court, some were chatting in groups of three or five, and some were riding bicycles to work. At this time, the blackboard newspaper standing in front of the transportation workshop was surrounded by a dense crowd. The headline "The Origin of 22,000 Rubber Rings" attracted so many workers. Everyone discussed it, and some gave a thumbs up and praised: "Wow! Picking up 22,000 rubber rings is really not easy!"
　　This is an article praising old switchman Zhang Fenglin for picking up rubber rings. Zhang Fenglin started picking up rubber rings in 1950. The poverty of the old society made him develop the habit of managing his household diligently and thriftily. One day, when he was walking on the tracks after get off work, he saw a rubber ring on a wind pipe joint, picked it up and put it in his pocket, and gave it to the shunting team workers to use the next day. "Don't underestimate a small rubber ring! Without it, the car can't run, and rubber is also a very scarce thing! It's a pity to let it lie on the ground," Zhang Fenglin always thought.
　　He lives on Kejian Street on the north side of the station. Every day when he goes to and from work, or goes to the station to study and attend meetings, he has to walk through the tracks in the station. He takes advantage of this convenient condition and picks up rubber rings whenever he sees them on the ground. For more than seven years, picking up rubber rings has become his amateur "career". In winter, the days are short, it gets light late, and it gets dark early. When he goes to and from work, he carries a signal light, shines it on the tracks and looks carefully, and picks up rubber rings when he finds them. Once, it was the "third nine" day (the coldest period of winter according to the Chinese lunar calendar), and he saw a rubber ring frozen by the water released from the locomotive, only showing its head. He dug for a long time but couldn't dig it out. Finally, he found an iron nail on a freight car and dug it out. Someone asked him: "It's so cold, why bother doing that?"
　　"It's state property. Losing one is losing one, picking up one is gaining one, and a little adds up to a lot!"
　　After the news of Zhang Fenglin picking up rubber rings spread in Shenyang Station, the workers gave him a nickname, called "King of Picking Up Rubber Rings". As of the beginning of July this year, he had picked up a total of 22,000. Calculated at a value of 13 cents each, he has saved a total of 2,626 yuan for the state. ·Wang Yingjie Yang Chengren·

### 张凤林的“业余事业”

　　张凤林的“业余事业”
    一个初夏的早晨，沈阳火车站调车场上的机车吼叫着。工人们有的在球场上打球，有的三、五成群在谈笑着，有的骑着自行车上班。这时候耸立在运输车间门前的黑板报，被人们围了个风雨不透。“两万二千个胶皮圈的来历”的标题，吸引了那么多工人。一个个谈论着，有人伸着大拇指称赞说：“哎呀！拣了二万二千个胶皮圈，真不简单哪！”
    这是表扬老扳道员张凤林拣胶皮圈的文章。张凤林从1950年就开始拣胶皮圈。旧社会的贫困，使他养成了勤俭治家的习惯。有一天下班的时候，他在线路上走着，看见有个风管接头上的胶皮圈，就拣起来放进兜里，第二天交给调车组工人使用。“别小看一个小小的胶皮圈啊！缺了它就开不了车，胶皮也是很缺少的东西哩！让它丢在地上多可惜。”张凤林总是这样想着。
    他家住在车站北边的克俭街，每天上下班，或者上车站学习、开会的时候，都得从站内的线路里走，他借着这个方便条件，看见地上有胶皮圈就拣起来。七年多来，拣胶皮圈已成为他的一番业余“事业”。冬天天短，天亮得晚，黑得早，他上下班时手提着信号灯，往线路上照着亮仔细地看着，发现胶皮圈就拣。有一次，是“三九”天，他看见一个胶皮圈被机车里放出来的水冻住了，只露出一个头来，他挖了好一会没有挖出来，最后还是到货车上找枚铁钉把它挖出来了。有人问他：“怪冷的，你费那个劲干啥？”
      “国家财产呗，丢一个就少一个，拣一个就多一个，聚少成多啊！”
    张凤林拣胶皮圈的事儿，在沈阳站传开后，工人们给他起了个绰号，叫“拣胶皮圈大王”。到今年7月初为止，共拣了二万二千个。每个按价值一角三分计算，他给国家共节约了人民币二千六百二十六元。　·王英杰　杨成仁·
