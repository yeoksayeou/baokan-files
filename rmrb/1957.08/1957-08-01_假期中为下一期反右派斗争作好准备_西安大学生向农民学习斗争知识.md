    During the current summer vacation, teachers and students from various universities in the Xi'an area, who had previously engaged in more than a month of fierce battle with the rightists and achieved preliminary victories, have launched various activities to arm their minds, investigate facts, and prepare to welcome the anti-rightist struggle in the next semester.
    Universities and colleges in the Xi'an area generally began their vacations around July 20th. Before the vacation, most school leaders made concluding reports to teachers and students based on the previous stage of the anti-rightist struggle, pointing out the direction of the struggle for the next stage.
    Teachers and students from Northwest University, Xi'an Teachers College, Shaanxi Teachers College, and the Architectural Engineering Institute who returned to the countryside for the summer vacation plan to use this opportunity to conduct an in-depth investigation in the countryside, to deeply understand the changes in the production and lives of peasants before and after liberation, so as to use ample facts to forcefully refute the shameless lies of the rightists. Xu Yujin, a student in the Department of Political Education at Xi'an Teachers College, who lives in the rural area of Xixiang County in southern Shaanxi, plans to study Chairman Mao's "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" and then use the class viewpoint to investigate and understand the living conditions of some peasants in southern Shaanxi, so as to use these targeted materials to severely refute the reactionary lie of the rightist Wang Zunyi who said that "the lives of peasants in southern Shaanxi have not improved." Many teachers and students who returned home also formulated propaganda plans, preparing to expose and introduce the reactionary words and deeds of the rightists and the masses' struggle against the rightists to the peasants, participate in socialist ideological education in the countryside, and help the peasants raise their awareness.
    Students from various schools and colleges who went home have generally proposed to take some time to personally participate in physical labor, so as to learn from the peasants and temper their ideological awareness.

    假期中为下一期反右派斗争作好准备
    西安大学生向农民学习斗争知识
    本报讯　曾经和右派分子进行了一个多月激战，并且初步获胜的西安地区各高等学校的师生，在目前暑假期间，又展开了各种活动，以武装思想、调查事实、准备迎接下学期的反右派斗争。
    西安地区各高等学校普遍于7月20日前后放假，大部分学校领导上在放假时，都根据过去一个阶段的反击右派斗争情况，向师生们作了小结报告，指出了下阶段的斗争方向。
    西北大学、西安师院、陕西师院、建筑工程学院等回农村度暑假的师生，准备利用机会，在农村作一次深入调查，深入了解解放前后农民生产、生活的变化，以便通过充分的事实，对右派分子的无耻谰言进行有力的驳斥。家住陕南西乡县农村的西安师院政教系学生徐毓锦，准备学习毛主席的“湖南农民运动考查报告”以后，运用阶级观点，对陕南一些农民生活情况进行调查了解，以便用这些针对性的材料，对右派分子王尊一说的“陕南农民生活没改善”的反动谎言痛加驳斥。许多回乡的师生，还拟定了宣传计划，准备把右派分子的反动言行和群众对右派分子的斗争情况向农民揭发和介绍，参加农村的社会主义思想教育工作，帮助农民提高认识。
    各校、院回家去的学生，都普遍提出了回家后抽出一定的时间，亲自参加体力劳动，以便向农民请教，锻炼自己的思想意识。
