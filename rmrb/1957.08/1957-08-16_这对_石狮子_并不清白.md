    These "Stone Lions" Are Not Innocent
    Wang Shikui, Dean of Studies, and Zhang Qijun, Vice Dean of Studies, at Yunnan University, proclaimed themselves to be "a pair of stone lions in front of the Ningguo Mansion" and therefore innocent. After two months of the anti-Rightist struggle, people have finally seen clearly that this pair of stone lions are not innocent.
    As soon as the blooming and contending began, this pair of stone lions thought their opportunity had come. Wang Shikui clamored that land reform was "inhumane," the suppression of counter-revolutionaries "killed countless people," the Three-Anti and Five-Anti campaigns were "making a joke of human lives," the purge of counter-revolutionaries was "brutal," and ideological remolding was "barbaric." He even cursed activists as "barbed wire." Zhang Qijun's curses were even more vicious. He cursed the school's Party Secretary as being "only able to manage the cafeteria and toilets" and berated the school for "using teachers as wet nurses for bureaucratic landlords." He opposed the leadership of scientific research, saying that "we should return to the academy system." He advocated that in teaching reform, "we must first completely bring in things from Europe and America." Under their frenzied instigation, and with the cooperation of Li Dejia and Chen Fuguang, Yunnan agents of the Zhang-Luo Alliance, Yunnan University was shrouded in black fog for a time. At this time, the stone lions were so carried away that they said:
   "The Communist Party's prestige has been swept away," "The school is helpless, our time has come."
    They did not remain complacent for many days before the mass anti-Rightist struggle began. Investigations revealed that Wang Shikui was originally this kind of person: in the past, he not only worked as an opium dealer, opened underground money houses, and engaged in speculative business, but also vigorously exerted effort for the Kuomintang's "rectification" of Yunnan University. After liberation, every single thing triggered his deep affection for the old society and his hatred for the new society. For example, when he went to Guangzhou last year, he saw the Aiqun Hotel and said: "Alas, such a big building, I wonder how many people jumped from here during the Three-Anti and Five-Anti campaigns!" When he arrived at West Lake, he was also moved: "This West Lake is really good, but it was built by forced labor prisoners, how many forced labor prisoners are there in the country!" But he was so passive in his work that he regarded writing work summaries as "being forced to join the Liangshan rebels." Zhang Qijun was a core member of the Zhang-Luo Alliance and a spark planted by Fei Xiaotong in Kunming. When Fei Xiaotong went to Kunming last August, he went to Zhang's house to give face-to-face instructions; Zhang also sought out targets for Fei, colluding to organize small-scale symposiums specifically to collect opinions from people dissatisfied with the Party. Fei Xiaotong's article "The Early Spring Weather of Intellectuals" was mostly Zhang Qijun's "secret feelings" revealed, and was actually a joint creation of the two of them.

### 这对“石狮子”并不清白

    这对“石狮子”并不清白
    云南大学教务长王士魁和副教务长张其浚自封为“宁国府门前的一对石狮子”是清白的。经过两个月来的反右派斗争，人们终于看清了这对石狮子并不清白。
    鸣放一开始，这对石狮子以为机会来了，王士魁便叫嚣说：土改是“惨无人道”，镇反“不知枪杀了多少人”，三反五反是“拿人命开玩笑”，肃反是“残暴”，思想改造是“野蛮”，还骂积极分子是“铁丝网”。张其浚骂得更是恶毒。他骂学校党委书记“只能管伙食、管厕所”，骂学校“把教师当作官僚地主家的奶妈使用”。他反对科学研究的领导，说什么“应回到书院制去。”他主张教学改革中，“先要全部把欧美的东西搬来”。在他俩疯狂的煽动下，在章罗联盟云南代理人李德家、陈复光等的配合下，有一段时间云南大学黑雾漫漫。这时，石狮子竟得意忘形地说：
  “共产党威信扫地了”，“学校已毫无办法，我们的时候到了”。
    他们并没有得意几天，群众性的反右派斗争开始了。经揭发，王士魁原来是这样一个货色：过去，他不但做过鸦片贩子，开过地下钱庄、做过投机生意，还为国民党“整肃”云南大学大卖过力气。解放后，一事一物都会引起他对旧社会的深情，对新社会的仇恨。如他去年到广州时，看到爱群大旅社，就说：“唉，这样的大楼，三反五反时不知有多少人在这里跳楼！”他到了西湖，又有感触了：“这西湖真好，但这是劳改犯修的，全国有多少劳改犯啊！”而他对工作却消极到这样的程度：把做工作总结看成是“逼上梁山的劳动改造”。张其浚则是章罗联盟核心分子、费孝通在昆明埋下的一个火种。去年8月费孝通到昆明，曾到张家面授机宜；张也曾为费物色对象，串连组织小型座谈会，专收集对党不满的人的意见。费孝通的“知识分子的早春天气”一文，大部分是张其浚吐露的“曲衷”，实际上是他俩共同的创作。
