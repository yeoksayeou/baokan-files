Xinhua News Agency, 20th - American journalist Joseph Alsop's Paris dispatch recounts the dissatisfaction of Western Europe with "American leadership" and the growth of anti-American sentiment.

The author points out that Britain and France "have obvious and widespread distrust of the current American leadership, including Eisenhower himself, and almost universal hatred for Secretary of State Dulles personally." Dulles is now the most detested person in the eyes of Europeans. The author says: "The growing distrust of American leadership is causing increasing divisions in the policies of Western allies."

The reporter emphasizes that although Dulles made "great efforts" to "conceal this seeming agreement but actual estrangement," "disagreements in policy still exist" and have "intensified."

The author believes that these divisions are caused by the United States' disregard for the difficulties of Britain and France.

Alsop also unreservedly said that Britain and France lost their "imperial status and colonies" due to American conspiracies, which is also a cause of the divisions. The British and French "are always complaining about American pressure"; the French in North Africa also complain about "American conspiracies."

　　英法对美国貌合神离
    杜勒斯是欧洲人心目中最可憎的人物
    新华社20日讯　“纽约先驱论坛报”记者约瑟夫·艾尔索普的一篇巴黎通讯诉说了西欧对“美国领导”的不满以及反美情绪的增长。
    作者指出，英国和法国“对目前的美国领导，包括艾森豪威尔本人在内，有着明显而广泛的不信任，而对国务卿杜勒斯个人几乎有着普遍的憎恨”。杜勒斯现是欧洲人心目中最可憎的人。作者说：“对美国领导日益增长的不信任在西方盟国的政策中引起越来越多的分歧。”
    记者强调指出，虽然杜勒斯费了“极大的努力”来“掩饰这种貌合神离”，但是“在政策方面的分歧仍然存在”，而且“加剧”了。
    作者认为，这些分歧是由于美国忽视英法两国的困难而引起的。
    艾尔索普还毫不掩饰地说，英法由于美国的阴谋诡计而失去它们的“帝国地位和殖民地”，这也是产生分歧的原因。英国人和法国人“总是在抱怨美国的压力”；北非的法国人还埋怨“美国的阴谋”。
