    Who Says Swine Fever Cannot Be Eradicated
    Guo Jincheng
    Swine fever is a major enemy in developing pig production; but swine fever is not inevitable.  Please look at the facts from Honghu Township in Huangyan County, Zhejiang Province, and Qianjing Cooperative in Hulan County, Heilongjiang Province:

    In 1955, Honghu Township lost 926 pigs, accounting for 65% of the total number of pigs; in the same year, Qianjing Cooperative lost more than 300 pigs, accounting for 60% of the total. In 1956, the situation underwent a fundamental change. Honghu Township lost only five pigs, accounting for 0.13% of the total; Qianjing Cooperative lost nine pigs, accounting for 0.7% of the total.

    The large number of pig deaths in Honghu Township in 1955 left a terrifying impression in the minds of the masses, and everyone lacked confidence in raising pigs. The Honghu Township branch of the Chinese Communist Party realized that vigorously eliminating swine fever was the key to developing pig raising at present. Therefore, it made a resolution to eradicate swine fever and conducted extensive ideological mobilization within the Party and the Communist Youth League. At the same time, it organized corresponding institutions, with the township setting up a pig-raising officer and establishing a livestock and veterinary medical team. The entire township widely publicized common knowledge of epidemic prevention and hygiene. Five rounds of pigsty soil digging and disinfection were organized, fundamentally improving the breeding environment. The township cultivated a backbone team of epidemic prevention, mainly composed of five veterinary personnel, who, in addition to daily publicity, completed two rounds of swine fever vaccination, one round of swine erysipelas vaccination, and also treated 243 sick pigs. In addition, all purchased piglets were subject to quarantine and vaccination, completely blocking loopholes from external infections. Secondly, the masses were educated to strictly prohibit the slaughtering, selling, and eating of diseased pigs, and members were mobilized to supervise each other, and arrangements were made for the proper handling of pigs that died of the epidemic. The township's organized mutual insurance for pig raising was also an effective way to promote breeding management, strengthen planned epidemic prevention, and improve the masses' sense of responsibility for pig raising, which was very popular among the masses.

    The above facts tell us that as long as we improve breeding management and strengthen epidemic prevention work, we can prevent the occurrence of swine fever.

    谁说猪疫不能消灭
    郭金城
    猪疫是发展生猪生产的大敌；但是猪疫不是不可避免的。请看浙江省黄岩县洪湖乡和黑龙江省呼兰县前井社的事实吧：
    1955年洪湖乡死猪九百二十六头，占生猪总数的65％；同年，前井社死猪三百多头，占总数60％。1956年，情况发生了根本变化，洪湖乡仅仅死猪五头，占总数0.13％；前井社死猪九头，占总头数0.7％。
    1955年洪湖乡生猪大批死亡的事实在群众心里留下恐怖的印象，大家对养猪缺乏信心。中共洪湖乡支部认识到：大力消灭猪疫，是当前发展养猪中的关键。于是作出扑灭猪疫的决议，并在党、团内进行广泛的思想动员。同时组织了相应的机构，乡上设立生猪办事员，成立畜牧兽医小组。全乡广泛展开了防疫卫生常识的宣传。组织了五次猪栏挖土消毒，基本上改善了饲养环境。乡上培养了以五名兽医人员为主的防疫骨干队伍，他们除进行日常宣传外，完成了两次猪瘟预防注射，一次猪丹毒预防注射，还治疗病猪二百四十三头。另外，凡外购仔猪一律进行检疫和预防注射，彻底堵塞了外来感染的漏洞。其次，教育群众严禁宰杀、贩卖和吃病猪，发动社员互相监督，并安排了疫死猪的善后处理办法。全乡组织的生猪互助保险，也是推动饲养管理、加强计划防疫、提高群众养猪责任心的有效办法，很受群众欢迎。
    以上事实告诉我们，只要改善饲养管理，加强防疫工作，就可以防止猪疫发生。
