I raise my hand and shout loudly!
    Wei Yang
    I raise my hand and shout loudly: Oppose the Rightists in the name of poor and lower-middle peasant members of cooperatives, in the name of China's first generation of cultured farmers, in the name of demobilized soldiers at the lathe, in the name of the dockworkers of Gate No. 6, in the name of the crane operator girls erecting the Wuhan Iron and Steel Plant, in the name of future surgical experts doing dissection internships, in the name of the Communist Youth League members rafting timber in the forest, in the name of yesterday's White-Haired Girl and today's Long Donghua, in the name of the martyrs who have been immortal underground for a hundred years, in the name of the tears and white hair of the martyrs' mothers.
    I raise my hand and shout loudly: Oppose the Rightists in the name of the people!
    I raise my hand and shout loudly: Oppose the Rightists in the name of the coal smoke above Anshan that darkens the white clouds, in the name of 5.55 million tons of iron and 4.98 million tons of steel, in the name of the 4000th Victory-brand car driven out of Changchun, in the name of the perilous and steep road with nine turns and eight bends on Mount Erlang, in the name of the vehicles coming and going on the Yangtze River Bridge, in the name of the lights in the Three Gate Gorge construction site Party committee office, in the name of the waving handkerchiefs at the station bidding farewell to those going to develop the frontier, in the name of the passionate love letters sent from the frontier, in the name of the shining bayonets on the coastal defense line, in the name of the primary trainer planes flying at low altitude.
    I raise my hand and shout loudly: Oppose the Rightists in the name of labor!
    I raise my hand and shout loudly: Oppose the Rightists in the name of every labor day with generous pay, in the name of the residents lining up to buy grain and cooking oil in order, in the name of the colorful floral fabrics in the shop windows and the fabric purchase coupons in my hand, in the name of the schistosomiasis patients who have recovered, in the name of millions of sacred voter certificates, in the name of every marriage certificate filled with happy words, in the name of the travelers walking safely on the road, in the name of the summer nights as quiet as dreams, in the name of the thunderous applause in the theater, in the name of poetry and truth!
    I raise my hand and shout loudly: Oppose the Rightists in the name of socialism!
