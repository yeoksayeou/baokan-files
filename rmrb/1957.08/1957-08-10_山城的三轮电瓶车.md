Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, August 8th. A new type of transportation, the electric tricycle, appeared on the streets of Chongqing on the 7th. This tricycle, bearing a trial run wooden plate with red characters on a white background, traveled back and forth on the streets of Chongqing throughout the afternoon, attracting the attention of pedestrians, and groups of children cheered for this novel mode of transportation.

The designer and driver of this electric tricycle, engineer Zhang Zhonghua, told reporters after returning to the Chongqing Public Transportation Company: The trial run proves that the electric tricycle has been successfully tested. Chongqing, a mountain city, is restricted by steep and winding streets, so the tricycles popular in general cities cannot be used in Chongqing. For a long time, passengers arriving in Chongqing by ship or train, as well as patients and women in labor, have felt inconvenienced due to the lack of auxiliary transportation. The design of the electric tricycle is intended to change this situation.

Zhang Zhonghua said that the current electric tricycle is pieced together using aircraft parts, tricycle vehicles, and existing old batteries. In future formal manufacturing, new batteries will be used, and the number of batteries can be reduced from the current eight to two, and the weight can be reduced by more than one hundred kilograms. The economic effects of the electric tricycle have not yet been calculated in detail, but it is estimated that the cost per vehicle kilometer is one dime, and it can carry two passengers and general luggage. The Chongqing Public Transportation Company is planning to manufacture them in large quantities to meet the needs of passengers and residents for auxiliary transportation.

    山城的三轮电瓶车
    新华社重庆8日电　7日，重庆街头出现了一种新型的交通工具——三轮电瓶车。这辆挂着红字白底的试车木牌的三轮电瓶车，当天的整个下午在重庆街头往返奔驶，吸引着行人的注意，成群的儿童向这一新奇的交通工具欢呼。
    这辆三轮电瓶车的设计者和驾驶者张仲华工程师在返回重庆市公共交通公司以后向记者说：试车证明，三轮电瓶车已经试验成功了。重庆山城因受街道坡陡、弯多的限制，一般城市十分流行的三轮车，在重庆无法使用。长期以来，乘轮船、火车到重庆的旅客以及病人、产妇等都因辅助交通工具缺乏而感到不便。电瓶三轮车的设计就是为改变这种状况。
    张仲华说，现在这辆电瓶车是利用飞机零件、三轮车车辆和现有旧式电瓶拼凑而成。将来正式制造，采用新式电瓶，电瓶数目可以由现在的八个减少到二个，重量可以减轻一百多公斤。现在对三轮电瓶车的经济效果还没有详细计算，估计每车公里的成本为一角钱，可以载两个旅客和一般行李。重庆市公共交通公司正计划大批制造，以满足旅客和居民对辅助交通工具的需要。
