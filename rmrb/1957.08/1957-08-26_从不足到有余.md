　　From Shortage to Surplus
　　I am an elementary school teacher and a housewife. There are three people in my family (including a two-year-old child). Our monthly grain ration totals 74 jin. Rationally speaking, this amount of grain should be enough, but in the past, we always ran short by three or two days each month. Why was this the case? It turned out that I wasn't precise with my cooking in the past, and I often made too much. Sometimes I forgot to eat it, and by the time I remembered, it had already gone bad. Sometimes, even if we were already full, we forced ourselves to finish the extra food. The leftovers in the pot were often not cleaned out before being washed away, and there was a lot of waste from leftovers in our bowls. Making noodles, pancakes, steamed buns, or dumplings also consumed the most grain. Usually, eating one meal of dumplings meant consuming the equivalent of one and a half meals' worth of flour. Also, the child throwing food and not eating at regular times wasted some grain.
　　Since the newspaper called on everyone to save grain, especially after my hometown suffered a major flood this year, I was determined to be frugal with grain in my household. Now, I estimate the amount of food I need to cook for each meal, ensuring that we have enough to eat without wasting any, and I try to balance dry and liquid foods. Secondly, we eat more steamed bread and rice, and less noodles, pancakes, steamed buns, and dumplings, because eating rice is more economical than eating flour. Rice soup is also very nutritious, and I try my best not to waste it.
　　Thirdly, I patiently educate my child not to throw food and to develop the habit of eating at regular times. In addition, vegetables are very cheap now. For example, one jiao can buy five jin of pumpkin, which can be mixed into porridge. Onion leaves and celery leaves can be washed, chopped, mixed with a little flour, steamed, and seasoned with oil and salt, which is not only economical but also tastes good. In this way, from July 10th to August 10th, our family not only had enough of our 74 jin ration, but also saved four jin of flour. In order to support socialist construction and help our compatriots in the disaster areas, we decided to reduce our grain purchases by one jin per person each month and strive to be even more frugal to save even more grain.

　　从不足到有余
    我是个小学教员，也是个家庭主妇。家中有三个人吃饭（一个二周岁的孩子）。每月的口粮，共计七十四斤。照理说这些粮食是够吃的，可是过去每月总要差三、两天的粮食。为什么会这样呢？原来是我过去做饭没有准，往往一做就多，有时忘记吃，等到想起吃它时，已发出臭味了。有时饭多一点点，本来已经饱了，却硬要吃下去；锅里的剩饭往往没弄净，就刷掉了，碗里剩碗根，浪费也很大。赶面条，烙饼，做死面卷或者包饺子也最消耗粮食，平时吃一顿饺子，总得吃掉一顿半饭的面。另外，孩子撒饭，不按顿吃也浪费些粮食。
    自从报纸号召人人节约粮食后，特别是我的老家，今年遭了大水灾，促使我下决心，要在家庭用粮方面做到精打细算。现在，我每做一顿饭都要估量一下，做到既够吃，又不浪费，并且使干的和稀的搭配着吃。其次是多吃发面和大米，少吃面条、烙饼、死面卷和饺子，因为吃大米比吃面省些，米汤的营养也很好，我尽量做到不浪费。
    再次，耐心地教育孩子，不要抛撒食粮，养成他按顿吃饭的习惯。另外，现在菜蔬很便宜，如南瓜一角钱可买五斤，可以掺煮在稀饭里，葱叶、芹菜叶都可以洗净切碎，稍微加面一拌，蒸熟后用油盐一调，不但节约了粮食，味道也适口。这样我们全家从7月10日到8月10日，七十四斤口粮不但够吃，而且节余了四斤面粉，为了支援社会主义建设，为了支援灾区同胞，我们决定每人每月少购一斤粮，并且进一步精打细算，争取节余更多粮食。
