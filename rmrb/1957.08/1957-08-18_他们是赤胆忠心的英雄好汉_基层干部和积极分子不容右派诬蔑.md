    They are Heroes with Utmost Loyalty
    基层干部 and Activists Cannot Be Slandered by Rightists
    In their attack on the Party and socialism, bourgeois rightists conjured up countless evil winds, attempting to plunge our great socialist nation into darkness so they could fish in troubled waters. One such evil wind was directed straight at the 基层干部 and activists. The wind conjurers chanted: 基层干部 were "new local bullies oppressing the people," "frogs in a well, lacking both virtue and talent"; activists were "yes-men, clowns in a drama," "achieving leadership positions by stepping on the heads and blood of others," and so on. In the eyes of the rightists, the Party and government's 基层干部 and activists were all black and gray, thorns in their flesh, and needed to be removed. However, the Party and the broad masses of people, unlike these wind-conjuring monsters, regard the vast numbers of 基层干部 and activists as treasures because they are all heroes who are wholeheartedly safeguarding the revolutionary cause and the interests of the people.
    The reasoning is clear.
    基层干部 and the vast number of activists are distributed in rural villages, streets, factories, mines, and other grassroots units throughout the country. They are the nerve cells that make up the entire body of the Party and the state, the direct implementers and embodiments of the Party and government's policies. They live among the masses, are most familiar with the masses' thoughts, emotions, opinions, and demands, and understand the various social and natural conditions of the area. They are the absolutely necessary bridge and link for the Party and the government to promote work and connect with the masses; they are the cornerstone of the Party and the government.
    The grassroots level is the forefront of all our work and struggles, which is also the most arduous place. It is precisely the thousands upon thousands of 基层干部 and activists who work and fight on this front line year after year, silently and without recognition. During the revolutionary war, 基层干部 and activists were heroes who persisted in fighting the enemy and protecting the interests of the masses. During the great transformation of the Three Great Reforms, which fundamentally changed the nature of society, 基层干部 and activists once again demonstrated their noble qualities. In production and construction, as well as in the struggle against various disasters, 基层干部 and activists have everywhere shown their exemplary role. For example, in the recent struggle to rescue people from the floods, many heroic deeds of self-sacrifice emerged.
    The Party believes that only when the working masses rise up to fight for their own liberation can they truly liberate themselves. Therefore, the Party has always attached great importance to cultivating cadres and activists from among the masses. Over the decades, thousands upon thousands of outstanding individuals have emerged in mass movements. The Party has relied on them to lead the broad masses, step by step, to achieve today's great revolutionary achievements. All 基层干部 and activists are valuable assets of the Party and the people. We must cherish them, care for them, and nurture them, and not allow them to suffer unreasonable attacks and harm, so that they can continue to improve in the struggle.
    The Party and the people consider 基层干部 and activists to be the pillars of the country, while the rightists consider them to be thorns in their sides that must be removed. This contradictory phenomenon is not surprising because it is based on two completely different standpoints. The rightist gentlemen view cadres of worker-peasant origin (i.e., former slaves) from the standpoint of the bourgeoisie (i.e., the gentleman's standpoint of stepping on the heads of the worker-peasant masses in the past), producing an indescribable disgust from class instinct—these slaves who can neither read nor reason are actually sitting on an equal footing with my generation of gentlemen and even pointing fingers, this is simply outrageous! In the eyes of the gentlemen, it is simply impossible to "tolerate" the slaves coming to power after the gentlemen stepped down. This is just the general principle. In fact, the rightists' hatred of 基层干部 and activists has a deeper and more direct reason. As mentioned earlier, 基层干部 and activists are at the forefront of the struggle. Therefore, it is they who have personally used ruthless iron palms to strike down landlords, local bullies, secret agents, counter-revolutionaries, and all other villains who undermine the revolutionary cause, and struck them so hard that they can never harm the people again. Unfortunately, these overthrown evil forces have blood ties with our rightist gentlemen; some are relatives, some are friends, and some are even "flesh and blood." When the rabbit dies, the fox grieves; when things of the same kind are hurt, there is grief. In addition to disgust, a layer of hatred is added; enemies seeing each other are especially furious. They naturally want to attack the 基层干部 and activists viciously and regard them as thorns in their sides to be removed. This is the exposure of the rightists' class nature. But the problem is by no means so simple. There is also a political conspiracy in it. They are very clear that the 基层干部 and activists are the foundation of the Party and the government, and the bridge connecting the Party and the government with the masses. If the 基层干部 and activists are overthrown, the foundation of the Party and the government will be shaken, and the bridge connecting with the masses will also be removed. The Party and the government will be isolated and will collapse.
    The Party has always believed that many 基层干部 and activists have shortcomings, especially some shortcomings in their work style. Therefore, the Party always constantly educates, cultivates, and improves them, so that they can better undertake the new tasks of socialist construction. As for the very few class alien elements and degenerates who have infiltrated the ranks of 基层干部 and activists, they can never represent the face of the entire 基层干部 and activists. They are even bad guys who are precisely in the same vein as the rightist gentlemen. The Party and the government have always taken the most resolute measures to eliminate such elements.
    Rightist gentlemen, it seems that your evil wind is not working.

### 他们是赤胆忠心的英雄好汉  基层干部和积极分子不容右派诬蔑

专栏：地方报上的反右派评论

    他们是赤胆忠心的英雄好汉
    基层干部和积极分子不容右派诬蔑
    资产阶级右派分子在向党、向社会主义进攻中，曾祭起了无数股妖风，企图把我们这个伟大的社会主义国家刮得天昏地暗，以便从中混水摸鱼。其中有一股妖风，是直接指向基层干部和积极分子头上刮来的。只听得祭风者口中念念有词：基层干部是“欺压人民的新恶霸”，“是井里的蛤蟆，无德无才”；积极分子“是应声虫，是戏剧中的小丑”，“是踏着别人的头皮和鲜血取得领导地位”等等。在右派分子的心目中，党和政府的基层干部和积极分子是一片灰黑，是肉中刺、眼中钉，非拔除不可。但是，党与广大人民和这些兴妖作怪的祭风者相反，对广大基层干部和积极分子却视如珍宝，因为他们都是赤胆忠心地维护革命事业和人民利益的英雄好汉。
    道理是明明白白的。
    基层干部和广大积极分子，分布在全国各地的农村街道和厂矿及其他基层单位中，是构成党和国家整个机体的神经细胞，是党和政府的政策的直接执行者和体现者，他们生活在群众之中，最熟悉群众的思想情绪、意见和要求，最了解当地的各种社会情况和自然情况，是党和政府推行工作、联系群众的绝对必需的桥梁和纽带，是党和政府的基石。
    基层，这是我们一切工作和斗争的最前线，也就是最艰苦的地方。正是千千万万的基层干部和积极分子，经年累月、默默无闻地在这个前线上工作着、战斗着。在革命战争时期，基层干部和积极分子曾经是坚持对敌斗争、保卫群众利益的英雄，在三大改造这个根本上改变社会性质的大变动中，基层干部和积极分子再一次表现了自己的高贵品质。在生产建设中以及和各种灾害斗争中，基层干部和积极分子更处处表现了他们的模范作用。例如在最近的抢救水灾的斗争中，就出现了许许多多舍己为人的英雄事迹。
    党认为只有劳动群众自己起来进行斗争，才能真正解放自己，所以党从来就十分重视从群众中培养干部和积极分子。几十年来，在群众运动中涌现出来千千万万的优秀分子，党就是依靠他们带动着广大群众，一步一步地取得了今天这样伟大的革命成就。所有的基层干部和积极分子，都是党的宝贵财产，也是人民的宝贵财产，我们要十分珍爱他们，关心和培养他们，不使他们遭受无理的攻击和损害，使他们在斗争中继续不断地提高。
    党和人民认为基层干部和积极分子是国家的栋梁，而右派却认为是一些直到拔除而后已的眼中钉。这种矛盾的现象并不奇怪，因为这是完全站在两个不同的立场上去看问题的。右派老爷们是从资产阶级立场出发（也就是过去踩在工农群众头上的老爷立场），去看待工农出身的干部（也就是过去的奴隶），从阶级本能上产生了一种不可名状的嫌恶——好家伙，你们这些既不识字又不通理的奴隶，竟然和我这老爷辈的平起平坐，并且还指手画脚，这简直是岂有此理！老爷下了台，奴隶上了台，在老爷看来，实在是不能“顺眼”的。这只是一般的道理，其实右派分子仇视基层干部和积极分子，还有一种更深刻更直接的道理。如前所述，基层干部和积极分子是处于斗争的最前线，因此，正是他们亲手用无情的铁掌把地主恶霸、特务反革命及其它一切破坏革命事业的坏蛋打倒的，而且打得是那样的狠，打得他们永远也不能再祸害人民了。不幸的是，这些被打倒的恶势力，却和我们的右派老爷有着血肉的联系，有的是亲戚，有的是朋友，有的甚至就是“亲骨肉”。兔死狐悲，物伤其类，悲伤之余，在嫌恶之上又加上了一层仇恨；仇人相见分外眼红，他们对基层干部和积极分子自然是要加以恶毒的攻击，并当作眼中钉拔除的。这就是右派的阶级本性的暴露。但是问题绝不如此简单，这里面还有一个政治阴谋。他们很清楚，基层干部和积极分子是党和政府的根基，是党和政府同群众联系的桥梁，打倒了基层干部和积极分子，党和政府的根基就动摇了，和群众联系的桥梁也拆除了，党和政府就要孤立、就要垮台。
    党向来认为不少的基层干部和积极分子是有缺点的，特别是作风上的一些缺点。所以党总是经常不断地对他们进行教育，培养和提高他们，使他们更能承担起社会主义建设的新任务。至于混入基层干部和积极分子队伍中的极少数阶级异己分子和蜕化变质分子，绝不能代表整个基层干部和积极分子的面貌，他们甚至恰恰是和右派先生们一脉相通的坏蛋，党和政府对这种分子从来就是采取最坚决的措施，加以清除的。
    右派先生们，看来你们的妖风不灵了。
