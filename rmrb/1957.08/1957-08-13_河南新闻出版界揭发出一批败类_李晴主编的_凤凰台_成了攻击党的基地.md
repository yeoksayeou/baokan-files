Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou Dispatch: The struggle of the news and publishing circles in Henan Province against bourgeois rightists has deepened, and a group of rightists have been exposed.

The entire staff of the Henan Daily editorial department has held twelve consecutive debates over the past month, criticizing the anti-Communist fallacies of rightist Ren Zhong (assistant editor of the Henan Daily's agricultural department). Ren Zhong absurdly put forward his so-called "principles for running a newspaper after the success of the socialist revolution." According to Ren Zhong's "principles," the Party newspaper would not have to accept the leadership of the Party committee, and the newspaper "should report purely objectively, regardless of whether the report has a good or bad effect on the Party and the people." Ren Zhong also clamored to "abolish the mass work of the newspaper editorial department" and "abolish the political theory study of reporters and editors."

Li Qing, the head of the cultural life group of Zhengzhou Daily, is a rightist element disguised as a Communist Youth League member. During the period of the Great Blooming and Contending, the "Fenghuangtai" supplement of the Zhengzhou Daily, which was under Li Qing's charge, became his base for attacking the Communist Party and socialism. Li Qing used the pen name Liu Wuji to write essays and fables, continuously using exaggerated techniques and vicious words to launch a large-scale attack on the Communist Party. For example, in the article "What Has the Fish Done Wrong to the Hook?", Li Qing slandered the Party's rectification campaign as "fishing," and that good people have been "rectified," therefore he complained on behalf of the "fish."

Rightist Li Wei (assistant editor of "Henan Peasant" of Henan People's Publishing House) madly scolded Communist Party members as "fake foreign devils" and "clay idols" during the rectification period, and scolded active elements close to the Party as "obedient people," "mosquitoes," and "weather vanes." He even described today's society as "pitch black," saying that he was working and living in a "dark room," with "no democracy, no sunshine."

When these rightist elements realized that their absurd remarks could no longer stand after being criticized, they have begun to show signs of admitting their guilt. However, they are evasive and incomplete in their thorough confession of their anti-Communist conspiracies. Therefore, the struggle against them is still ongoing.

### 河南新闻出版界揭发出一批败类  李晴主编的“凤凰台”成了攻击党的基地

    河南新闻出版界揭发出一批败类
    李晴主编的“凤凰台”成了攻击党的基地
    新华社郑州讯　河南省新闻出版界反对资产阶级右派的斗争深入展开，一批右派分子被揭露出来。
    河南日报编辑部全体人员，一个月来连续举行了十二次辩论会，批驳右派分子任重（河南日报农业部助理编辑）的反共谬论。任重荒谬地提出他的所谓“社会主义革命成功以后的办报原则”。按照任重的这些“原则”，党报竟可以不接受党委领导，报纸“应当纯客观地进行报道，不管报道后对党和人民起好作用还是起坏作用”。任重还叫嚣要“取消报纸编辑部的群众工作”，“取消记者、编辑的政治理论学习”。
    郑州日报文化生活组组长李晴，是一个披着共青团员外衣的右派分子。在大鸣大放期间，李晴负责主编的郑州日报副刊“凤凰台”，成了他向共产党、向社会主义进攻的基地。李晴先后用柳无忌的笔名，写杂文、寓言，连续用夸张的手法、恶毒的字眼向共产党大肆进攻。像在“鱼何负于钓”一文里，李晴诬蔑党的整风是在“钓鱼”，钓出了好“整”，因此他替“鱼”叫屈。
    右派分子李蔚（河南人民出版社“河南农民”助理编辑）在整风期间，疯狂地骂共产党员是“假洋鬼子”、“泥菩萨”，骂靠近党的积极分子是“顺民”、“蚊子”、“风向针”，他甚至把今天的社会形容是“一团漆黑”，说自己是在“暗室”里工作、生活，“没有民主，没有阳光”。
    这些右派分子当自己的荒谬言论已经被批驳得站不住脚的时候，已经开始表示低头认罪。但对他们反共的阴谋，却吞吞吐吐，不作彻底交代。因此，对他们的斗争还在继续进行。
