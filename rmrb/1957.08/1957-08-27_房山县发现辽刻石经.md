　  Discovery of Liao Dynasty Stone Sutras in Fangshan County

    A complete set of Liao Dynasty stone sutras has been discovered under the Duck Sutra Pagoda, located forty to fifty *li* southwest of Fangshan County, Hebei Province. This collection includes 180 stone sutras created by Emperor Daozong of the Liao Dynasty and 4,080 created by Master Tongli during the Liao Dynasty.

    The stone sutras housed in the Stone Sutra Mountain of Yunju Temple in Fangshan County have long been famous throughout the country. This location contains stone sutras carved during the Sui, Tang, Liao, Jin, Yuan, and even Ming and Qing dynasties. In April of last year, the Buddhist Association of China, in preparation for commemorating the 2,500th anniversary of Sakyamuni's *Nirvana*, undertook a large-scale project to make rubbings of the stone sutras there. At the same time, based on relevant written records indicating that one of the four major sets of Liao stone sutras was buried under the Duck Sutra Pagoda south of Yunju Temple, they began excavation work.

    This batch of stone sutras, unearthed on August 7th of this year, will be of great help in collating and verifying the Tripitaka, and will also be of considerable value in researching historical relics and institutions of the Liao Dynasty.

### 房山县发现辽刻石经

　  房山县发现辽刻石经
    一批完整的辽刻石经在河北省房山县西南四五十里鸭经塔下发现。这批石经中有辽道宗皇帝所造石经一百八十片和辽时通理大师所造四千零八十片。
    房山县云居寺石经山所藏石经早已闻名全国，那里有隋、唐、辽、金、元以至明清等朝代所刻石经。去年4月，中国佛教协会为了准备纪念释迦牟尼?槃二千五百年，到那里大规模拓印石经。同时，他们根据有关材料记载，辽石的四大部石经中有一部埋在云居寺南鸭经塔下，因而开始这项发掘工作。
    今年8月7日出土的这批石经，对校勘藏经将有很大帮助，对考证辽时历史文物制度也会有相当价值。
