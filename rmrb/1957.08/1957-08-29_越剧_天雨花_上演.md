　　Yue Opera "Tian Yu Hua" Performed
　　"Tian Yu Hua" is one of the traditional Yue Opera repertoires, originally taken from a section in the eleventh chapter of the "Tian Yu Hua" ballad novel. The content describes how Zuo Weiming, a caring and insightful official, used his wisdom and skillful means to overturn a miscarriage of justice. This play used to be popular in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. The Nanjing Yue Opera Troupe, based on the oral account of the actress Zhu Shuizhao, has reorganized it, and it is now being performed in the capital.

　　The reorganized "Tian Yu Hua" has initially achieved the goal of eliminating the dross and retaining the essence. For example, the key to the verdict, "the human head complaint," has been changed to Zuo Weiming's reasoning and thinking, which not only makes the plot more reasonable but also makes the character more distinct. Also, the scenes "catching the adultery" and "killing the wife" are treated as off-stage events, which purifies the stage image without compromising the twists and turns of the plot. In particular, the scene "matching embroidered shoes" is performed with singing and dancing, which is beautiful and moving, giving full play to the strengths of Yue Opera. In addition, the play makes full use of percussion music, and it has chosen Shaoxing Gao Diao, San Wu Qi Diao, and Ling Ling Diao, which have not been used for a long time, making the Yue Opera music novel and diverse. However, the plot of this play is still relatively loose, and there are also some unreasonable aspects.

　　The Nanjing Yue Opera Troupe was well received last year for their performances in Beijing of "Nan Guan Cao," "Liu Yi Delivers the Letter," and other plays, which will also be staged this time. They have also adapted Guo Moruo's drama "Peacock Gallbladder" and are rehearsing it intensively, preparing for its premiere in Beijing. (Yang Xin) (Attached picture)

### 越剧“天雨花”上演

　　越剧“天雨花”上演
    “天雨花”是越剧传统剧目之一，原采自“天雨花”弹词小说第十一回中的一段。内容描述深体民情的官吏左维明以他的智慧和巧妙的手段，平反了一桩冤狱。这戏在过去曾流行于江、浙一带，南京市越剧团根据演员竺水招口述整理后，现在正在首都上演。
    整理后的“天雨花”，初步做到了去芜存菁。如将判案关键的“人头告状”改为左维明推理思索，这不仅使情节趋于合理，而且使人物性格更加鲜明。又如将“捉奸”、“杀妻”二场戏改作暗场处理，就纯净了舞台形象而无损于情节的曲折离奇。特别是“对绣鞋”一场戏，演出时载歌载舞，优美动人，发挥了越剧的特长。此外，戏中充分使用了打击乐，并且选择了很久未用的绍兴高调、三五七调、伶伶调，使越剧乐曲新颖多采。但是，这个戏的情节还比较松弛，也有不够合理的地方。
    南京市越剧团去年来京演出深受欢迎的“南冠草”“柳毅传书”等剧目，这次还将上演。他们还改编了郭沫若的话剧“孔雀胆”，正在紧张地排演，准备首次在京演出。　（杨欣）（附图片）
