Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, August 4th: Farmers in Suning County, Hebei Province, have launched a major debate centered on the policy of unified grain purchase and supply, and have concluded that the policy of unified grain purchase and supply is very good. Now, the farmers are actively handing over public grain and selling surplus grain, and their enthusiasm for production has also greatly increased.

In the great debate, the farmers conducted profound self-education with vivid facts. Zhangzhuang Township summarized the benefits of implementing the unified grain purchase and supply policy. After the flood last year, the grain harvested in this township was only enough for the entire township to eat for ten days. However, from the time of the disaster to this year's wheat harvest, the state supplied a total of 1.87 million jin of grain, and the people of the entire township survived the disaster. At a large debate meeting of nearly 600 people in Qianbaisi Village, the secretary of the CCP village branch said: From the autumn disaster to this year's wheat harvest, the state supplied a total of 263,000 jin of grain. This grain was transported by trucks and ships from thousands of miles away, costing the state a lot of money. Villager Li Fuxiang said: "After the flood in 1939, my family sold our house and land, but my father still starved to death. Last year's flood was even more severe, but the price of grain was stable, and we didn't have to worry about food. If it weren't for the state's unified grain purchase and supply policy, wouldn't my family have been ruined?"

After the great debate, the farmers believed that it was wrong to demand that the state collect less, purchase less, and sell more grain. Currently, more than 86 million jin of wheat for tax and purchase have been delivered to the granaries throughout the county, accounting for 62% of the total task. Many agricultural cooperatives are continuing to transport the wheat that should be handed over and sold to the grain depots. The county has launched a production competition of accumulating fertilizer, topdressing, weeding seedlings to eliminate wasteland, and controlling autumn locusts, striving for a bumper autumn harvest.

    肃宁农民展开粮食问题大辩论
    批判要国家少征少购多销的错误想法
    新华社保定4日电　河北省肃宁县农民以粮食统购统销政策为中心展开大辩论，得出的结论是粮食统购统销政策好得很。现在，农民们正积极缴公粮、售余粮，生产情绪也大大提高。
    在大辩论中，农民们以生动的事实作了深刻的自我教育。张庄乡对贯彻粮食统购统销政策以来的好处作了总结。去年水灾后，这个乡收获的粮食只够全乡人吃十天。但是，从受灾后到今年麦收，国家共供应粮食一百八十七万斤，全乡人才度过了灾荒。前白寺村近六百人的大辩论会上，中共村支部书记说：去秋受灾到今年麦收，国家共供应粮食二十六万三千斤。这些粮食都是车运船载，千里而来，国家赔钱很多。社员李福香说：“1939年水灾后，我家卖房卖地，爹还是饿死的。去年水灾更重，可是粮价稳定，吃的不愁。不是国家规定粮食统购统销政策，我家还不是家破人亡吗？”
    经过大辩论以后，农民们认为要求国家少征、少购、多销粮食是不对的。现在，全县送交入库的征、购小麦已达八千六百多万斤，占总任务的62％。许多农业社正在继续把应交、售的小麦向粮库运送。全县已开展起积肥追肥、锄苗灭荒和除治秋蝗的生产竞赛，争取秋季大丰收。
