Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 9th: The Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Otto Grotewohl, delivered a government statement in the People's Chamber on August 8th regarding the German Democratic Republic.

Grotewohl began by posing the question of what methods should be adopted to achieve progress on the issue of German reunification. He stated that both the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany are now states with legitimate rights to exist, and neither Germany can establish national power or unilaterally extend that power across Germany. He emphasized that the German Democratic Republic existed in the past, exists now, and will continue to exist until the task of unifying Germany into a unified, peace-loving, and democratic state is completed, and until the influence of socialism throughout Germany is guaranteed.

In the statement, Grotewohl analyzed the different paths taken by the two Germanys and the different international and domestic environments in which they exist. He also analyzed the two distinctly different relationships between socialist and capitalist countries. He said that the nature of the imperialist occupation system should also be viewed from this perspective. Essentially, one should not compare our Soviet friends who defend peace here with the troops stationed in West Germany, who, given the opportunity, would help initiate a war in which Germans slaughter each other, which would also provoke a global atomic war. Therefore, I must declare: we consider it our responsibility to ensure that foreign troops gradually withdraw from German territory and that foreign military bases are dismantled one by one. Germany needs neither foreign troops nor foreign military bases. What Germany needs is peace and a peace treaty. We are very pleased that our views on this issue are consistent with those of our Soviet friends.

Grotewohl pointed out that the claim that there are insurmountable differences between the two Germanys is unfounded. He said that there is a force that can and will overcome these differences, promote mutual rapprochement, reach agreements, and restore unity. This force is the German people themselves. Incorporating one part of the country into another is not a way to eliminate differences. This viewpoint is held by imperialists. This viewpoint will not solve the problem, but will only cause new contradictions.

Grotewohl pointed out that under the current circumstances, where there are two distinctly different Germanys pursuing diametrically opposed domestic and foreign policies, there is no basis for holding so-called "free elections" to unify Germany. If such elections were forced, they would not be elections but simply an attempt to drag the German Democratic Republic into the imperialist war policy under militarist rule.

He said, what is the path before us now that guarantees peace and a unified Germany? This path can only be achieved at present through the establishment of a national confederation that does not restrict the independence of either country. This is the only bridge to achieve a unified Germany without the use of force, without violence, and without the consequences and dangers of war.

Grotewohl pointed out that, as a second-best option, the two Germanys could exist as equal states within a peaceful region of Europe or within a European collective security system, and reduce armaments, eliminate atomic weapons, and reduce troops. This would be a major practical step to seek peace and promote and accelerate the national unification of Germany.

He said that the establishment of a unified, peaceful, and democratic Germany can only be a matter for the Germans themselves. Therefore, the two Germanys should hold negotiations. Anyone who sincerely supports the peaceful unification of Germany can only take one path.

After recounting the German Democratic Republic's proposal of July 26th, Grotewohl put forward three suggestions:

	1.  Prohibit the storage and manufacture of atomic bombs and atomic weapons in Germany and unanimously agree to prohibit the propaganda of atomic warfare.
	2.  The two Germanys should withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact respectively, abolish conscription, and conclude an agreement on the number of troops on both sides.
	3.  Jointly or separately, request the four powers to gradually withdraw their troops from all of Germany in the near future.

He said that reaching agreement on these issues of vital importance to the German people would lay the foundation for the formation of a confederation of two independent and autonomous Germanys. In this way, it would be easier to reach agreements on more issues in future negotiations, such as business relations, tariffs, currency, transportation, postal services, and telecommunications, as well as issues concerning the status of Berlin and the lifting of West Germany's ban on democratic parties and democratic organizations. At the same time, proposals and decisions passed with the general support of the various autonomous entities of the confederation should be fully implemented by the two German governments on a voluntary basis, without any coercion.

Because the government of the German Democratic Republic does not want to complicate the issue of the unification of the two Germanys, it does not insist on discussing issues related to the future development of West Germany or the German Democratic Republic. However, the government of the German Democratic Republic wants to declare that it certainly believes that the path of peace, democracy, and socialism is the correct path for the development of the entire Germany.

Grotewohl concluded by saying that if we can act in a unified country like a united people, then the German people will surely be able to find a grand avenue leading to a peaceful and bright future, leading to well-being and happiness.

### 民主德国政府声明  重申两个德国结成国家联盟主张  建议分别退出军事集团要求四大国逐步撤军

    民主德国政府声明
    重申两个德国结成国家联盟主张
    建议分别退出军事集团要求四大国逐步撤军
    新华社柏林9日电　德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥8月8日在人民议院发表了德意志民主共和国政府声明。
    格罗提渥一开始就提出究竟应该采取什么方法才能在统一德国的问题上获得成就的问题。他说，德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国现在都是具有合法存在权利的国家，而哪一个德国都不能在德国建立全民族的权力和单方面地在德国扩展这种权力。他强调说，德意志民主共和国过去存在，现在存在，而且它要存在到德国统一成为一个统一的爱好和平和民主的国家的事业完成的时候，存在到社会主义对全德国的影响有保障的时候。
    格罗提渥在声明里分析了两个德国所走的不同的道路和它们所处的不同的国际和国内环境，他也分析了社会主义国家之间和资本主义国家之间两种截然不同的关系。他说，对帝国主义占领制度的性质也应当根据这一点来观察。本来，根本就不应当把在我们这里捍卫和平的苏联朋友同驻在西德的军队相提并论，后者是一俟有机会就帮助发动使德国人民骨肉自相残杀的战争，同时也就是挑起世界原子战争。因此我不能不声明：我们认为我们的责任就是使外国军队一步一步地退出德国领土，把外国军事基地一个个地拔掉。德国既不需要外国军队，也不需要外国军事基地。德国需要的是和平和和平条约。我们很高兴，我们在这个问题上同我们的苏联朋友的看法是一致的。
    格罗提渥指出，两个德国之间存在不可克服的分歧的说法是没有根据的。他说，有一种力量能够，而且一定会克服分歧，促进互相接近，达成协议和恢复统一。这种力量就是德国人民自己。把国家的一部分归并到另一部分不是消除分歧的办法。这种观点是帝国主义者持有的观点。这种观点不能解决问题，只会引起新的矛盾。
    格罗提渥指出，在目前存在着两个截然不同的德国，它们奉行着截然相反的内政和外交政策的情况下，根本谈不上举行所谓“自由选举”来统一德国的问题。如果硬要进行这种选举，那便不会是选举，而只是想在军国主义统治下把德意志民主共和国拖入帝国主义的战争政策中去罢了。
    他说，目前我们面前的保证和平和统一德国的道路怎样呢？这条道路目前只有通过建立不限制两国中任何一国独立的国家联盟。这是唯一可以不使用武力、不通过暴力、可以避免战争后果和危险而达到统一德国的桥梁。
    格罗提渥指出，如果不得已而求其次的时候，两个德国可以在欧洲和平地区范围内或者欧洲集体安全体系内作为平等的国家存在，并且裁减军备，取消原子武器和削减军队。这将是一个求得和平并且促进和加速德国民族统一的一个重大的现实的措施。
    他说，建立一个统一的、和平民主的德国只能是德国人自己的事情。因此，两个德国应当举行谈判。谁要是诚心拥护德国的和平统一，他就只能走一条路。
    格罗提渥在追述了德意志民主共和国7月26日的建议后提出三点建议：
    一、禁止在德国境内存放和制造原子弹和原子武器，一致协议禁止宣传原子战争。
    二、两个德国分别退出北大西洋公约组织和华沙条约，取消兵役制和缔结双方军队人数的协定。
    三、共同地或分别地向四大国要求在不久的将来逐步从全德国撤出自己的军队。
    他说，在这样一些对德国人民切身重要的问题上达成协议，就会为两个独立自主的德国结成联盟奠定基础。这样，在今后的谈判中就便于在更多问题上达成协定，例如事务联系、关税、货币、运输、邮电等问题以及有关柏林地位和取消西德对民主党派和民主团体的禁令的问题。同时，在联盟各自治团体普遍支持下通过的建议和决定，应该由两个德国政府完全在自愿的基础上实现，不得有任何勉强。
    现在德意志民主共和国政府由于不愿意使两个德国统一的问题复杂化，因此不坚持讨论同西德或是德意志民主共和国今后发展有关的问题。不过德意志民主共和国政府要声明，它当然认为，和平、民主和社会主义的道路是整个德国发展的正确道路。
    格罗提渥最后说，如果我们能在统一的国家里像团结一致的人民那样行动，那么，德国人民就一定能够找到通向和平、光明的未来的大道，找到通向康乐幸福的大道。
