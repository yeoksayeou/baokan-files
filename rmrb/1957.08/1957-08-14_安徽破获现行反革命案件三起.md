    Anhui Province Uncovers Three Counter-Revolutionary Cases

    (Report from our Anhui Reporter Station) Anhui Province recently uncovered three active counter-revolutionary cases. The ringleaders of three counter-revolutionary organizations, the "China Democratic Party," "Three Buddha Way," and "People's Livelihood Self-Salvation Committee," have been arrested.

    The main culprits of the "China Democratic Party," Ruan Si'kai, Ding Xian'zhao, Yang Liben, He Xianren, and others, were active in the Tongguanshan mining area. They produced a party program, party constitution, national flag, party flag, and formulated a work plan for 1957. From June 22 to July 16, over twenty days, they continuously distributed more than sixty reactionary slogans and leaflets. They also wrote letters inciting the masses, attempting to surround the Tongguanshan Copper Mine, blow up the mine shafts, and murder cadres. On the evening of July 16, at 11 p.m., these counter-revolutionary elements were caught by public security organs while distributing reactionary slogans again, and the entire case was solved.

    The "Three Buddha Way" reactionary organization in Shou County, on the evenings of May 13 and 14, gathered more than forty thugs for emergency meetings, planning a major riot on the evening of the 15th. However, a few hours before the riot, we uncovered it and arrested twelve key members, including Chen Zefu and Wang Fuzhang. Another seven key offenders were killed on the spot for attacking during the arrest.

    The counter-revolutionary underground army "People's Livelihood Self-Salvation Committee" was also uncovered by us in Jinzhai County. This reactionary organization appointed officials and bestowed titles upon themselves, waiting for an opportunity to riot. They engaged in reactionary propaganda, robbery, theft, and disturbing public order. The head of the reactionary organization, Guo Kekuan, was a former bandit and secret agent who had been treated leniently by us, but he did not repent. In order to consolidate the people's regime, the county people's committee sentenced him to death on July 25. Other reactionary elements, Zhao Dazhen, Zheng Guiyang, and Zheng Guocai, were also sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment.

    安徽破获现行反革命案件三起
    本报讯　安徽省最近破获了三起现行反革命案件。“中国民主党”“三佛道”“民生自救委员会”三个反革命组织的首要分子已被逮捕。
    “中国民主党”的主犯阮嗣铠、丁显肇、杨立本、何先仁等，在铜官山矿区活动，制有党纲、党章、国旗、党旗，并制订有1957年工作计划。在6月22日到7月16日的二十多天中，他连续散发反动标语、传单六十多张，还写信煽动群众，妄图包围铜官山铜矿，炸掉矿井，杀害干部。这批反革命分子，在7月16日晚十一时，正当又一次散发反动标语的时候，被公安机关抓住，全案破获。
    在寿县的“三佛道”反动组织，曾于5月13日、14日两晚，纠集了四十多名暴徒，紧急集会，定于15日晚大暴动。但在暴动前几小时，被我破获，逮捕了陈泽富、王富章等十二名首要分子，另有七名首犯因在被捕时行凶，被当场击毙。
    反革命地下军“民生自救委员会”，也在金寨县被我破获。这个反动组织自己封官加委，待机暴动。他们进行反动宣传、抢劫、偷窃、扰乱人心。反动组织的头子郭克宽，是曾被我宽大处理的匪特分子，但不知悔改。为巩固人民政权，县人民委员会已于7月25日将他处极刑，其他反动分子召大振、郑桂扬、郑国才也分别判处了有期徒刑。
