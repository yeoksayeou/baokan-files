Jiangsu Province has achieved a bumper harvest of early autumn crops such as early rice, spring corn, and spring soybeans, which are now being brought to market.

　　Of the province's more than seven million mu of early rice, the vast majority have yielded a good harvest, with only a small number experiencing reduced production due to flooding. The Songjiang Special District's 300,000 mu of double-cropping early rice yielded an average of about 500 jin per mu, an increase of about 10% compared to last year. The Yangzhou Special District's more than two million mu of early rice is estimated to have an average yield of 400 jin per mu; the Yancheng Special District's more than one million mu of early rice is estimated to have an average yield of more than 300 jin per mu, both higher than the bumper year of 1955.

　　The province has more than eleven million mu of spring corn and spring soybeans. Their large-scale bumper harvest is rare in recent years. In Guanyun County, the average yield per mu of 800,000 mu of spring corn is expected to increase by 73% compared to last year, and by 37% compared to the highest-yielding year of 1955. In Danyang County, the average yield per mu of 100,600 mu of spring soybeans is expected to be 200 jin, an increase of about 30% compared to last year.

    江苏早秋作物大丰收
    江苏省的早稻、春玉米、春大豆等早秋作物大丰收，目前已开始登场。
    全省七百多万亩早稻，除极少数受涝减产外，绝大部分丰收。松江专区三十万亩双季早稻，平均每亩收五百斤左右，比去年增产约一成。扬州专区两百多万亩早稻，估计每亩平均产量可达四百斤；盐城专区一百多万亩早稻，估计每亩平均产量可达三百斤以上，都比丰收的1955年还要高些。
    全省春玉米和春大豆共一千一百多万亩。它们的大面积丰产，更是数年来所少见的。灌云县八十万亩春玉米，每亩平均产量可比去年增加73％，比产量最高的1955年也要增加37％。丹阳县十万零六千亩春大豆，平均每亩可收两百斤，比去年增产三成左右。　（新华社）
