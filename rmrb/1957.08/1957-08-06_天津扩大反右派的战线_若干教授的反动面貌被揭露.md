Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 4th. The anti-Rightist struggle has been expanded among teachers in Tianjin's various universities.

　　Nankai University has opened five battlefields for the anti-Rightist struggle. Rightist element Li Baozhen, professor of the Economics Department, used his position as vice chairman of the Nankai University China Democratic League branch to carry out a series of malicious provocations and instigations among teachers. He, along with some people from the Jiusan Society who were dissatisfied with the Communist Party, and those dissatisfied with the departmental adjustments and the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, once gathered together for a meeting. At the meeting, they completely negated the achievements of Nankai University's past movements and maliciously attacked Teng Weizao, member of the Nankai University Party Committee and Deputy Dean of Academic Affairs, proposing to bring down Teng Weizao and squeeze out Ji Taoda, the head of the department, in order to control the Economics Department and maintain capitalist economics. This small group included Associate Professor Ren Zhenwei, Professor Yang Jingnian, and Fu Zhufu, among others. They proposed that if they could not defeat Teng Weizao, they would implement the lowest program—to disband. On the newly opened battlefield of the Mathematics Department, the anti-socialist activities of Rightist elements Yan Shuzhong and Zhang Yanhang, teaching assistants in the Mathematics Department, and Chen Benjing, a teaching assistant in the Physics Department, who had once gone to the park to form an offensive and defensive alliance, were exposed.

　　The anti-Rightist struggle among teachers at Tianjin University has also penetrated into various departments. Rightist element Zhao Yunshan, professor of the Mechanical Engineering Department, who everywhere incited trouble and slandered the school as a "prison without sunlight," was questioned by the majority of teachers. As the vice chairman of the Tianjin University China Democratic League branch, during the Great Blooming and Contending, he went around spreading rumors and slandering the "Suppression of Counter-revolutionaries" movement, shouting "injustice" for those who were arrested and struggled against, and spreading anti-socialist remarks among teachers such as "The Communist Party uses intellectuals when they need them, and beats them when they don't," "The Communist Party is an amateur and cannot lead technology," and "The Party Committee's leadership of the school is fundamentally impossible." Rightist element Xiang Zigang, professor of the Chemical Engineering Department, also revealed his anti-Party and anti-socialist tail in the anti-Rightist struggle. He turned black and white upside down, slandering the "Suppression of Counter-revolutionaries" movement as "some people were struggled against because they offended individual Party members or activists," and cursed the activists in the "Suppression of Counter-revolutionaries" as having "tongues stained with blood." The teachers angrily exposed the reactionary essence of this Rightist element, who, as a professor at Renmin University, actually still defended the interests of the bourgeoisie and had served as a Kuomintang major.

　　With the deepening of the anti-Rightist struggle at Hebei Tianjin Normal College, the once rampant Rightist element Wang Maigan, associate professor of the Fine Arts Department, and others, also bowed their heads and confessed their crimes. He admitted to having a conspiracy to control the "Artists Association" and the Fine Arts Publishing House as his anti-socialist base.

    天津扩大反右派的战线
    若干教授的反动面貌被揭露
    据新华社天津4日电　天津各高等学校教师扩大反右派斗争的战场。
    南开大学共开辟了五个反右派斗争的战场。右派分子、经济系教授李宝震，利用南开大学民盟支部副主委的职务，在教师中进行了一系列恶意挑拨和煽动，他同九三学社反对共产党不满的一些人，和对院系调整及“三反”、“五反”等运动不满的人，曾经集中在一起开会。他们在会上全盘否定南开大学历次运动的成绩，并且恶意地攻击南开大学党委委员、副教务长滕维藻，提出搞垮滕维藻，挤走系主任季陶达，以便控制经济系和维护资本主义经济学。在这个小集团中有副教授任振威、教授杨敬年、傅筑夫等人。他们提出，如果打不倒滕维藻，就实现最低的纲领——散伙。在新开辟的数学系战场上，揭露了曾经跑到公园里订过攻守同盟的右派分子、数学系助教阎树重、章延汉和物理系助教陈本敬的反社会主义活动。
    天津大学教师反右派斗争也已深入到各系。到处煽风点火、污蔑学校是“不见天日的牢狱”的右派分子、机械系教授赵蕴山，受到了广大教师的责问。他是天津大学民盟支部的副主委，在大鸣大放时，他到处扬言污蔑“肃反”运动，替被捕、被斗的人喊“冤”，并在教师中散布“共产党对知识分子要用就用，要打就打”、“共产党外行，不能领导技术”、“党委领导学校根本不行”等反社会主义的言论。右派分子、化工系教授向子刚，也在反右派斗争中露出了反党反社会主义的尾巴。他颠倒黑白，污蔑“肃反”运动是“有些人得罪了个别党团员或积极分子就被斗争”，并且大骂“肃反”中积极分子“舌头沾满着鲜血”。教师们愤怒地揭露了这个身为人民大学的教授，而实际上还维护资产阶级利益和当过国民党少校的右派分子的反动本质。
    河北天津师范学院随着反右派斗争的深入，使得一度猖狂的右派分子，美术系副教授王麦杆等人，也低头认罪了。他承认有控制“美协”和美术家出版社来作为自己反社会主义阵地的阴谋。
