A scholar turned thief is still skilled in rhetoric, even during his confession. The beauty of it lies in, after being forced to admit his crimes in the face of stolen goods and evidence, he can still disguise himself as an innocent and good citizen; thereby softening the hearts of some people, blocking others from exposing more of his crimes, hiding his true form and getting away with it. Rightist "leading figures" are precisely these kinds of people. At the National People's Congress, they were forced to admit to some of the facts revealed; "surrendering," "pleading guilty," "admitting mistakes," "asking for forgiveness," "reforming themselves," each appearing exceptionally sincere. But when it comes to who they are, they say they are not rightists.

According to their own accounts, they each have other titles: Huang Qixiang is someone who "in twenty years... has never for a moment ideologically separated from the Communist Party"; Tan Tiwu is someone who "from the War of Resistance Against Japan began to love the Party, move closer to the Party, and was determined to follow the Party"; Zhang Naiqi is someone who is "true gold that fears no fire," and has "nothing in common with those rightists who politically oppose the Party and oppose socialism"; Huang Shaohong wanted to "follow behind the Communist Party and slip into socialist society"; Long Yun is a subjective "patriot"; Chu Anping did not "get mixed up" with Luo Longji "politically"; Ye Duyi "as early as 1952 politically drew a line between himself and him (Luo Longji)"; Ma Zemin is a "liberal," and both he and Li Boqiu were "unconsciously poisoned." In this way, each is very "clean" and "beautiful."

Then why do they all have words and deeds opposing the Communist Party and opposing socialism? It is said that this is only because: "their stance was unstable, swayed by rightist arguments," "easily exploited by rightist elements," "given a thorough exploitation by the 'curse ghost'," "unconsciously acting as tools of the rightists," "blood pressure too high" and "impulsive," "unconsciously moving towards a position of anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-people," and for this, they "initially felt utterly loyal and full of grievances"!

One of the heads of the Zhang-Luo alliance, Luo Longji, referred to by the above-mentioned rightists as "he" who "exploited them," should be a rightist, right? But it is said that he is not either, but only played a "pushing the waves, helping the tide" role in the rightists' attack. "I ask myself, I absolutely have no ambition or conspiracy to overthrow the Party or overthrow socialism." Not only himself, but even the people in his "invisible small organization" only "colluded with local rightist elements," and are not rightists themselves. To borrow a phrase from Xue Pinggui on Wujia Slope: "Truly, he's pushed it all away clean!"

Everyone was "exploited," or merely an "abettor," and the real rightists have vanished into a vague, elusive state; they all believe they exist, but no one can specifically point out who they are. In fact, the rightists have not been mystified to this extent; what is being played here is a game of deception, which can be seen through at a glance by those with discerning eyes. Because the "abettor" is the original "exploiter," the "exploited" is the so-called "abetted"; since they all say to each other: "I was exploited by rightist elements," "I abetted rightist elements," it is evident that these "exploited" and "abetted" are all undoubtedly rightist elements.

However, this is not just a game, but reflects the sinister intentions of the rightist "leading figures." If we believe their claims, we can only be lenient with them. Because since they are all enthusiastic followers of socialism and the Communist Party, at most they have made some small mistakes of "unstable stance," and have anxiously "surrendered" and "pleaded guilty," what else cannot be forgiven?

People have become smarter and understand that one cannot talk about "magnanimity" with thieves, especially not with cunning habitual offenders, but rather must wage a more resolute and tenacious struggle against them. As time passes and the struggle deepens, the "thief's" true form will eventually be completely revealed. The exposure of Ma Zemin's sending people to create a "Little Hungary" incident conspiracy, and the revelation of Luo Longji's new crimes, are just some examples, aren't they? The tails of others, in the end, cannot be hidden either. "Those who do evil will not live," to get the forgiveness of the people, it is best to play fewer tricks.

    右派隐形术
    阮延顺
    秀才当了贼，就在招供时，也是善于辞令的。其妙处在于，当他被迫在赃证面前承认了罪行以后，还可以把自己装扮成一个无辜的良民；借以软化一些人的心肠，挡住别人揭发他更多的罪证，以隐住真形混过关去。右派“头面人物”们正是这样一些货色。在人民代表大会上，他们被迫承认了揭发的一些事实；“投降”呀，“请罪”呀，“认错”呀，“要求宽恕”呀，“重新作人”呀，个个显得诚恳异常。但说到自己是什么人时，却又说并非右派分子。
    根据他们自己的说法，他们是各有另外的名号的：黄琪翔是“二十年间……思想上没有一时一刻离开过共产党”的；谭惕吾是“从抗日战争开始就热爱党，靠拢党，决心跟着党走”的；章乃器是“真金不怕火”，“同那些在政治上反党、反社会主义的右派分子没有任何共同之点”的；黄绍竑是想“跟着共产党后面混进社会主义社会”去的；龙云是主观上的“爱国主义”者；储安平在“政治上”没有“勾搭上”罗隆基；叶笃义“远在1952年就在政治上和他（罗隆基）划清了界限”；马哲民是个“自由主义”者，他同李伯球都是“受毒而不自觉”的。如此这般，个个都“干净”、“漂亮”的很。
    那末他们为什么又都有反对共产党反对社会主义的言行呢？据说这也只是：“立场不稳，为右派言论所动摇”，“容易被右派分子所利用”，“给‘勾死鬼’狠狠地利用了一场”，“不自觉的充当了右派的工具”，“血压过高”而“冲动”了，“不知不觉走向反党、反社会主义、反人民的立场”而已，为此，他们“开始还觉得忠心耿耿满腹委屈”呢！
    章罗联盟的首脑之一，被上述右派分子指为“受他利用”的“他”，即罗隆基，总应该是一名右派分子了吧，然而据说也不是的，只是对右派分子的进攻，起了“推波助澜”的作用。“自问绝对没有推翻党推翻社会主义的野心和阴谋”。不仅自己，就连他的“无形小组织”中的人，也只是“勾结了当地的右派分子”，而并非就是右派的。借用武家坡上薛平贵一句话：“真真地推了一个干净啊！”
    彼此都是“被利用了”的，或者仅仅是“助长”者，而真正的右派分子却隐化成虚无缥缈不可捉摸的了；他们都信其有，但谁也无法具体的指出这是谁来。其实，右派分子也还没有神秘化到这种程度，这里玩的是一种障眼的游戏，明眼人是一望即穿的。因为“助长”者原就是“利用”者，“被利用”者即是所谓“被助长”者；他们既然彼此说：“我被右派分子利用了”，“我助长了右派分子”，可见，这“被利用”的和“助长”的，原都是些确凿无疑的右派分子。
    然而，这毕竟不是游戏，而是反映了右派“头面人物”的阴险居心。如果听信了他们的说法，就只能对他们高抬贵手。因为既然都是社会主义和共产党的热心追随者，充其量也不过是犯了些“立场不稳”的小错，而且诚惶诚恐“投降”、“认罪”了，还有什么过不去的呢？
    人们变得聪明了，懂得了对贼是不能讲“雅量”的，对于狡猾的惯匪尤其不能讲什么“雅量”，而是要对他们进行更坚决的韧性的战斗。随着时间的推移和斗争的深入，“贼”形毕竟是要完全毕露的。马哲民派人制造“小匈牙利”事件阴谋的暴露，罗隆基新的罪证的揭出，不就是一些例子吗？其他人的尾巴，终究也是藏不住的。“自作孽不得活”，要想得到人民的饶恕，还是少耍些花招为妙。
