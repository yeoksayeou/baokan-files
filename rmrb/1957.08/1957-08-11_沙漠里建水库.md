The farmers of Sandao Township in the Left Wing Rear Banner of Horqin, with the assistance of the government and farmers from neighboring townships, recently completed the construction of a farmland reservoir in the desert.

This reservoir was built through a combination of public and private efforts and construction began in April of last year. The reservoir's water storage area is four *li*, capable of storing more than 2.19 million cubic meters of water, enough to irrigate tens of thousands of *mu* of paddy fields.

In the past, farmers in this area suffered from insufficient river water and mostly planted dry land crops, but they experienced floods in nine out of ten years, resulting in no harvest. Since the reservoir began storing water last year, neighboring townships have vigorously developed paddy fields, increasing grain production. In 1955, Sandao Township had only about 2,000 *mu* of paddy fields, producing less than 6,000 *shi* of grain. This year, paddy fields have increased to more than 9,500 *mu*. Last year, grain production reached more than 8,900 *shi*. This reservoir also provides water for the paddy fields of some farmers in Kangping County, Liaoning Province. (Xinhua News Agency)

    沙漠里建水库
    科尔沁左翼后旗三刀乡农民在政府和邻近各乡农民协助下，最近在沙漠里建成一座农田水库。
    这座水库是民办公助的，在去年4月动工兴建。水库的蓄水面积有四华里，可贮水二百一十九万多方，能灌溉数万亩稻田。
    过去这一带的农民因河水不足，多种旱田，但十年九涝，没有收成。自去年水库开始蓄水后，附近各乡大力发展水田，提高了粮食产量。1955年三刀乡只有两千亩左右水田，打粮食不到六千石。今年水田增加到九千五百多亩。去年打粮食八千九百多石。这个水库还供给辽宁省康平县一些农民的稻田用水。（新华社）
