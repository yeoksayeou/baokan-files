Ministry of Health Further Strengthens Professional Leadership
Over 300 Counties and Cities Prevent and Control Schistosomiasis

    (Our Newspaper) To strengthen professional leadership over the national schistosomiasis prevention and control efforts, the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China has established a Schistosomiasis Prevention and Control Bureau in Shanghai.

    In the past, professional leadership of the national schistosomiasis prevention and control efforts was undertaken by the Disease Prevention Department of the Ministry of Health. However, the Central Committee's Nine-Person Leading Group for Schistosomiasis Prevention and Control was located in Shanghai, and scientific research institutions for schistosomiasis were also located in Shanghai, which sometimes led to insufficiently rapid and timely coordination. The establishment of the Prevention and Control Bureau in Shanghai will avoid and overcome the aforementioned shortcomings, thereby improving the efficiency of prevention and control operations.

    Since the end of 1955, when Chairman Mao made important instructions on eliminating schistosomiasis, and since the draft of the National Agricultural Development Program of 1956 proposed eliminating several diseases that posed the greatest threat to the people's health within a specific time frame, schistosomiasis prevention and control has been placed on the agenda of local Party committees. From the central government to the provinces, cities, counties, and townships, leading groups for schistosomiasis prevention and control have been established at all levels of Party organizations, and prevention and control committees have been successively established at all administrative levels. The Ministry of Health has elevated schistosomiasis prevention and control to the top priority of all disease prevention and control efforts. Following the policy of basically eliminating schistosomiasis in seven years, nineteen prevention and control institutes, two hundred and thirty-six prevention and control stations, and one thousand three hundred and forty-six prevention and control teams have been established. Over seventeen thousand professional prevention and control cadres have been trained, and large-scale prevention and control work has been carried out in three hundred and nine counties and cities in epidemic areas, achieving tremendous results.

　　卫生部进一步加强业务领导
　　三百多个县市防治血吸虫病
    本报讯　为了加强对全国血吸虫病防治工作的业务领导，中华人民共和国卫生部在上海设立了血吸虫病防治局。
    过去，全国血吸虫病防治工作的业务领导是由卫生部防疫司担负的。而中共中央防治血吸虫病九人小组设在上海，血吸虫病的科学研究机构也设在上海，工作配合上有时不够迅速及时。防治局在上海设立以后，将可以避免和克服上述缺点，提高防治业务工作效率。
    自从1955年底毛主席对消灭血吸虫病作了重要指示，和1956年农业发展纲要草案提出限期消灭几种危害人民健康最大的疾病以后，血吸虫病防治工作被列入地方党委的工作议事日程，从中央到各省、市、县、乡，相继成立了各级党组织防治血吸虫病的领导小组，行政上也先后成立了各级防治委员会。卫生部把防治血吸虫病提到了各种疾病防治工作的首要地位，按照七年基本消灭血吸虫病的方针，建立了十九个防治所，二百三十六个防治站，一千三百四十六个防治组，培养训练了一万七千多名专业防治干部，在流行区三百零九个县市开展了大规模的防治工作，取得巨大的成绩。
