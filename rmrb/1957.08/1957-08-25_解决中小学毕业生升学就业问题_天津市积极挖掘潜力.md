Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 24th: Relevant departments in Tianjin are actively exploring potential to solve the problem of enrollment and employment for primary and secondary school graduates.

This year, Tianjin’s primary and secondary schools have enrolled more than 130,000 new students. The number of students studying in regular middle schools and normal schools across the city is more than 151,000, the highest record since liberation, exceeding 5.5 times the number of students in 1948, when the Kuomintang reactionaries were in power. This year, Tianjin has built fifteen new middle schools and expanded eight middle schools. Educational funding for middle schools has also increased by 4.85% compared to last year. The Education Bureau has decided to change all first-year junior high school classes in the city to a two-shift system; it has also found ways to adjust the capacity of each classroom from an average of fifty students to fifty-two to fifty-four students; and it is adopting measures such as gradually assigning concurrent teaching duties to school principals and full-time Party and Communist Youth League cadres to solve the difficulty of a shortage of teachers.

In order to help primary and secondary school graduates who cannot continue their education to participate in agricultural production, relevant units contacted some agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs of Tianjin and Hebei Province as early as March and April of this year, making possible arrangements for graduates to go to the countryside. Many senior and junior high school graduates and older senior primary school graduates, after studying labor education and improving their understanding, have volunteered to return to their hometowns to participate in agricultural production.

For students who are younger or whose families are in the city and cannot continue their education but cannot immediately find employment, relevant departments are arranging conditions for them to study on their own.

　  解决中小学毕业生升学就业问题
　　天津市积极挖掘潜力
    据新华社天津24日电　天津市有关部门积极挖掘潜力，解决中小学毕业生升学就业问题。
    天津市中小学今年共招收了十三万多名新生入学。全市普通中学和师范学校在学的学生人数有十五万一千多人，是解放后的最高纪录，超过国民党反动统治时期学生人数最多的1948年的五点五倍。天津市今年新建了十五所中学，扩建了八所中学。用于中学的教育经费，也比去年增加了4.85％。教育局已决定将全市初中一年级的班次全部改为二部制；又设法把每一教室的容量由平均五十人调整为五十二到五十四人；并采取学校校长和党、团专职干部逐步兼课的办法来解决缺少师资的困难。
    为了帮助不能升学的中小学毕业生参加农业生产，有关单位早在今年三、四月间就和天津郊区和河北省的一些农业生产社取得了联系，为毕业生下乡做了可能的安排。许多高初中毕业生和年龄较大的高小毕业生，经过劳动教育的学习，提高了认识，纷纷自动回乡参加农业生产。
    年龄较小或家在城市升不了学而又不能马上就业的学生，有关部门正在为他们安排自学的条件。
