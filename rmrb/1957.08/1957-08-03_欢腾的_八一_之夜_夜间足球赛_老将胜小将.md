Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 2nd: On the jubilant "August 1st" night, Tianjin held its first-ever nighttime football match in China.

The two competing sides were a team comprised of veteran players with an average age of forty-five, and the Tianjin Municipal Football Amateur Sports School student team, whose players averaged only seventeen and a half years old. The veterans of the combined team were instructors and referees involved in the ongoing National Twelve-Unit Youth Football Tournament in Tianjin, including international and national referees.

From the start of the game, the veterans' footwork and passing skills won cheers from the more than twelve thousand spectators. Sun Jinshun, playing left inside forward, is a veteran who has been active on the football scene for thirty years and has been known as "Iron Leg" in football circles for kicking the ball through the net several times. He and Ye Beihua, playing left midfielder, coordinated effectively and passed skillfully; they were old partners from more than twenty years ago. They had participated in the Far Eastern Games and the Olympic Games together in 1930 and 1936. Last night, the two of them coordinated very well. Ye Beihua scored two goals alone with powerful left-footed shots and right-footed sweeps. Sun Jinshun also scored a goal into the net with a free kick from outside the eighteen-yard line. Many experts praised "Iron Leg's" tricky kick.

Gao Baozheng, a famous player playing in the back, intercepted and blocked both in front and on the sides, was also very brave, and sometimes dribbled straight into the opponent's penalty area.

The student team was very brave, but unfortunately lacked strategy, and finally lost to the veterans with a score of 2-3.

The newly built Tianjin Civil Garden lawn floodlit football field has four elevated light groups, emitting eighty thousand candlepower of light, illuminating the field as if it were daytime.

### 欢腾的“八一”之夜  夜间足球赛　老将胜小将

    欢腾的“八一”之夜
    夜间足球赛　老将胜小将
    据新华社天津2日电　在庆祝“八一”的欢腾之夜，天津市举行了我国有史以来的第一次夜间的足球赛。
    比赛的双方是队员平均年龄四十五岁的球坛宿将组成的联队和队员平均年龄仅有十七岁半的天津市足球业余运动学校学生队。联队的老将都是正在天津举行的全国十二单位青年足球锦标赛的有关的指导员和裁判员，其中有我国国际裁判和国家裁判。
    球赛一开始，老将们的脚头和传递功夫就博得一万二千多名观众的喝彩。踢左内锋的孙锦顺是驰聘球坛三十年、并几次把球踢穿球网而被誉为“铁腿”的足球界老前辈。他和踢左前卫的叶北华配合有方，传递巧妙，原来他俩是二十多年前的老搭挡。他们曾在1930年和1936年一道参加过远东运动会和奥林匹克运动会。昨夜他们两个人一直配合得很好，叶北华左脚劲射，右脚横扫，一人独建两功。孙锦顺在十八码线外罚任意球时也射入网内一球。很多内行人都赞赏“铁腿”这刁钻的一脚。
    走在后边的名将高宝正一人前后堵截，左右横拦，也十分骁勇，有时还盘球直闯对方禁区。
    学生队十分勇猛，但惜于缺乏智谋，终于以二比三败给了老前辈。
    刚刚建成的天津市民园草地灯光足球场设有四座高架灯组，放射出的八万烛巨光，照耀得球场如同白昼。
