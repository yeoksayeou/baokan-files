The Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China circulated the Xinyang Prefectural Committee's inspection report on the Donghongxing Agricultural Cooperative in Runan County's large-scale hemp trafficking activities. It demanded that Party committees at all levels pay serious attention to the capitalist tendencies of some agricultural cooperatives, educate peasants on the policy of unified purchase and sale, and give necessary treatment to Party cadres who have seriously violated the law and discipline.

    [Report from this Newspaper] The Donghongxing Agricultural Cooperative in Dawangqiao Township, Runan County, Henan Province, is a key cooperative in the township. Historically, the area has a tradition of growing hemp. In 1956, the cooperative planted 250 mu of hemp, producing over 24,000 jin. Except for 400 jin sold to the local supply and marketing cooperative, the rest was transported and sold to other areas. They also engaged in purchasing and trafficking at high prices on the market. Incomplete statistics from September of last year to May of this year show that over 81,900 jin of hemp, hemp rope, thread, and warp threads were transported out, making a profit of over 20,000 yuan.

    Because the cooperative's hemp trafficking was no longer just self-produced and self-sold, but rather commercial operations, it adopted a unified fundraising method based on the number of people. More than 1,600 people in the cooperative became shareholders, raising a total of over 8,000 yuan. Initially, dividends were distributed according to shares, but later changed to distribution per capita.

    The cooperative's means of speculative purchasing were: ① verbal deals in the market, with secret transactions; ② establishing fixed purchasing points, forcibly or at high prices; ③ mobilizing cooperative members to use their kinship to purchase, with daytime transactions and nighttime transportation.

    Led by the vice-chairman and the director of sideline production, a core leadership for hemp trafficking was formed. They went to more than 20 cities, including Zhengzhou, Xinxiang, Shijiazhuang, Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, and Harbin, signing supply contracts with local factories, handicraft cooperatives, supply and marketing cooperatives, and joint state-private enterprises. Statistics from only five contracts signed with four units show that the amount of hemp trafficked reached 113,800 jin.

    To evade market management, the cooperative also adopted illegal means such as night-time collection and transportation, escorted by militiamen. The area is at the border of Shangcai, Suiping, and Runan counties, and they sometimes collectively transported goods with some agricultural cooperatives in Huangbu Township of Shangcai and Daxingdian of Suiping.

    The cooperative's large-scale commercial speculation and trafficking activities have brought many serious negative consequences to the state, agricultural cooperatives, and cooperative members. First of all, it seriously affected agricultural production, and some people took the opportunity to embezzle. More seriously, the agricultural cooperative sought only profit, disregarding national interests, and deceiving the state by using inferior goods for good goods to seek exorbitant profits.

    Due to the private trafficking by the agricultural cooperative, the completion of the state's purchase plan and market supply were severely affected. In 1956, the purchase plan for this area's purchasing station was 170,000 jin, but only 75,000 jin were completed. This spring, although the supply and marketing cooperative reluctantly signed a pre-purchase contract for 300,000 jin of hemp skin with the agricultural cooperative, it appears that the agricultural cooperatives are not prepared to fulfill it, saying they will deliver hemp according to how much deposit is given.

    The Finance and Trade Department of the Xinyang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China has inspected the cooperative's commercial speculation activities and believes that the township-level Party committee lacks the necessary political and ideological education for the agricultural cooperative, and even has a one-sided mass perspective and a simple disaster relief mentality, and thus did not stop the cooperative's speculative activities. Some production and supply units arbitrarily raised prices in the market to purchase by any means, and the lax market management and some shortcomings in the work of the supply and marketing cooperative also promoted the agricultural cooperative's commercial speculation activities.

    In its instructions forwarding the Xinyang Prefectural Committee's inspection report, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out that the tendency of agricultural cooperatives to violate the state's unified purchase and sale and unified acquisition policies and develop capitalism should arouse serious attention from Party committees at all levels. The Provincial Committee requires Party committees at all levels, especially the branches of agricultural cooperatives, to educate peasants, especially Party members, on the state's unified purchase and sale and unified acquisition policies. The Provincial Committee also pointed out in its instructions that these capitalist speculative activities that violate the policies of the Party and the state are mainly carried out by some rural Party cadres colluding with private merchants. Without the enticement of private merchants and the use of private merchants by Party members, rural Party members generally would not engage in speculative business; if private merchants do not use Party members, they generally would not dare to be so boldly reckless now. The fact that the speculative activities of some Party members and private merchants in agricultural cooperatives have reached such a serious level without being stopped is inseparable from the fact that some Party committees do not sufficiently recognize the seriousness of this situation, and also from the relaxation of market management by some government and commercial administrative departments. The Provincial Committee believes that Party committees at all levels should seize typical cases to inspect the commercial speculation activities of agricultural cooperatives and launch discussions in agricultural cooperative branches, and give necessary treatment to Party cadres who have seriously violated the law and discipline.

    The Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China also pointed out that in the future, for all materials subject to unified acquisition, on the one hand, agricultural cooperatives and peasants should be educated and prohibited from signing contracts with any departments outside the province, and all those already signed should be invalidated. The government and judicial departments will not protect any debt disputes arising therefrom. On the other hand, any departments outside the province are prohibited from purchasing materials belonging to unified purchase and sale and unified acquisition from agricultural cooperatives and peasants. Violators are violating government decrees and should be seriously dealt with according to law. Those already purchased but not yet transported should be detained and purchased at the local state purchase price. In serious cases, the local government should impose sanctions according to law, and can impose economic fines.

### 决不能放任农业社进行商业投机

    决不能放任农业社进行商业投机
    中共河南省委批转信阳地委关于汝南县东红星农业社大量贩麻活动情况的检查报告，要求各级党委严重注意某些农业社的资本主义倾向，对农民进行统购统销政策的教育；对严重违法乱纪的党员干部要给以必要处理。
    本报讯　河南省汝南县大王桥乡东红星农业社是汝南县大王桥乡的重点社。这里历史上有种麻习惯。1956年全社种麻二百五十亩，产麻二万四千余斤，除将四百斤卖给当地供销社外，其余全部运销外地。同时还以高价在市场上套购贩运。仅去年9月至今年5月不完全统计，外运麻及麻绳、线、经子等共八万一千九百多斤，牟利两万多元。
    由于该社贩麻已不只是自产自销，而是商业经营，因此采取以人头为单位的统一筹备资金。全社有一千六百多人入了股。共筹资金八千余元。原按股分红。后改为按人头分红。
    这个农业社的套购手段是：①在市场口头挂钩，背地成交。②设立固定收购点，强行或高价收购。③发动社员利用亲戚关系串亲收购，白天成交、夜晚集运。
    该社以副社长和副业主任为首，形成贩麻领导核心。先后分赴郑州、新乡、石家庄、北京、天津、沈阳、哈尔滨、等二十多个城市，与这些地方的工厂、手工业社、供销社、公私合营企业等单位，签订了供应合同。仅据和四个单位签订的五份合同统计，贩麻数量达十一万三千八百斤。
    为了逃避市场管理，该社还采取了夜间集运，民兵护送的非法手段。这个地区是上蔡、遂平、汝南三个县的边沿，他们有时就和上蔡黄埠乡、遂平大兴店的一些农业社集体联运。
    由于该社大量从事商业投机贩运活动，已经给国家、农业社和社员带来了很多严重的恶果。首先严重地影响了农业生产，某些人员还趁机从中贪污，更严重的是农业社唯利是图，不顾国家利益，以次货顶好货欺骗国家牟取暴利。
    由于农业社的私自贩运，严重地影响了国家采购计划的完成和市场供应。1956年这个地区采购站的采购计划是十七万斤，只完成七万五千斤。今春供销社虽然与农业社勉强地签订了三十万斤麻皮的预购合同，从目前情况看，各农业社都不准备执行，他们说交多少定金给多少钱的麻。
    中共信阳地委财贸部对该社的商业投机活动已经作了检查，认为乡级党委对农业社缺乏应有的政治思想教育，甚至存有片面的群众观点和单纯的救灾思想，因而对农业社的投机活动不加制止。某些生产和供应单位，不择手段在市场上任意抬价收购，市场管理不严和供销社工作上的某些缺点，也促使了农业社进行商业投机活动。
    中共河南省委在转发信阳地委的检查报告的批示中指出：农业社违背国家统购统销和统一收购政策，发展资本主义的趋向，应当引起各级党委的严重注意。省委要求各级党委，特别是农业社的支部，要对农民首先是对党员进行国家的统购统销和统一收购政策的教育。省委在批示中还指出，这些违犯党和国家政策的资本主义投机活动，主要是有些农村党员干部和私商勾结起来干的。没有私商的勾引和党员利用私商，农村党员一般是不会做投机生意的；如果私商不利用党员，他们现在一般不敢那样大胆妄为了。农业社中的某些党员和私商的投机活动所以达到这样严重的程度而不得制止，是和某些党委对这种情况的严重性认识不足分不开的，也是和某些政府和商业行政部门放松市场管理分不开的。省委认为：各级党委应该对农业社的商业投机活动，抓住典型加以检查，并发动农业社支部进行讨论，对严重违法乱纪的党员干部给以必要的处理。
    中共河南省委还指出：今后，凡是统一收购的物资，一方面，教育和禁止农业社和农民同省外的任何部门签订合同，已签订者一律作废，为此发生的债务纠纷，政府和司法部门不予以保护；另一方面，禁止省外的任何部门向农业社和农民收购属于统购统销和统一收购的物资，违反者就是违反政府法令，应当严肃地依法处理，已经收购未运走者一律扣留，按当地的国家收购牌价予以收购，情节严重者，由当地政府依法给以处分，并可以给以经济上的罚款。
