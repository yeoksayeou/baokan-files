Gansu Daily News: From May 26th to June 22nd, Wushan County carried out the 1957 grain procurement work in Dongshun Township. They adopted the method of combining summer grain pre-distribution with the unified arrangement of grain requisition and purchase, and repeatedly explained policies to address the ideological concerns of cadres and the masses, comprehensively taking into account the interests of the state, agricultural cooperatives, and members. This ensured the smooth progress of the grain procurement work, with cooperative cadres happily accepting tasks and members being satisfied.

Dongshun Township had a bumper harvest last year and an increased production year this year. However, in the initial stage of promoting grain procurement, many cadres and the masses had concerns: some cooperative cadres were afraid of purchasing too much grain and deliberately claimed reduced production; some did not understand the policy that increased production must lead to increased procurement. Among the members, the strong laborers complained that they could not distribute more grain, saying that those with many children had an advantage; some were afraid that completing the state procurement tasks would result in less grain being distributed within the cooperative.

Political Education Conducted Based on Mass Thinking

In response to the various concerns of the masses, the work team held various meetings and used various publicity tools to comprehensively explain the principles of the procurement policy and the significance of increased production and procurement through specific examples, clarifying the significance and benefits of adjusting grain production and changing the tax system and tax rates. At the same time, the specific handling principles and working methods in the procurement policy were repeatedly explained, especially clarifying the principle of distribution according to labor and the method of distributing grain according to the number of people (distribution according to labor refers to the total income of the members, not simply reflecting more grain distribution), eliminating the concerns of the masses about untimely distribution and failure to meet basic needs. The publicity also included a review of the shortcomings of past grain distribution based on labor and the average distribution based on population. As a result, most people believed that the method of distributing grain according to the number of people was the most reasonable, and unanimously advocated distributing grain in different quantities according to the size of the population and the strength of labor, as long as the total did not exceed the "three fix" grain retention standard.

At the same time, five accounts were specifically calculated: the account of improved production and life, the account of state assistance to farmers, the account of mutual support between industry and agriculture, the account of increased production and bumper harvest this year, and the account that improved life must be subordinate to production development. Calculating these five accounts made the farmers realize that the burden of public grain was not heavy, and that the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain was an important measure to promote agricultural production and improve people's lives, and should be earnestly implemented.

Evaluating Production and Determining Cases on the Basis of Investigation

Evaluating normal annual production and correctly estimating this year's actual production are the most important links in doing a good job in procurement.

While strengthening publicity and education, the Dongshun Township work team conducted a lot of meticulous investigation and research work. It comprehensively investigated and registered changes in the cooperative's population, land, and draught animals, and collected the grain procurement books of each cooperative last year as a basis for verifying this year's data. For contracted fields and yields, in-depth on-site estimation and registration were carried out. After summarizing these three aspects of materials, they were compared with each other to clarify the increase and decrease changes and find out the reasons. Through realistic and in-depth investigation, the normal and actual production situations were grasped, and there was a clear understanding. Then, the method of "four comparisons" (comparing last year's actual production, this year's estimated production, the "three fix" fixed production, and the original normal production) was adopted, standard mu were selected, and the adjustment range was determined, so that the revised production reached a reasonable level.

Although Grain Procurement Increased Compared to Last Year, Cadres and the Masses Are Still Satisfied

On the basis of evaluating production and determining cases, calculating requisition and purchase began. In order to facilitate the determination of tax rates and balance the burden, requisition and purchase were calculated separately. First, fixed purchase was calculated, then increased purchase was calculated, and finally, analysis and measurement were carried out for adjustment, comprehensively taking into account the interests of the state, agricultural cooperatives, and members. The actual public grain and local self-raised grain (calculated at 15%) levied in Dongshun Township exceeded last year by 30,034 jin, an increase of 16%, with an average burden of sixteen jin per mu. The grain purchase was based on the principle that the "three fix" basis remained unchanged and that the increased production increased the purchase by 40%. After deducting the "four retentions" (retaining rations for the actual population and livestock, retaining seeds for the actual planting area next year, and retaining public grain according to the actual requisitioned amount), the surplus grain was calculated at a 90% purchase rate; the actual total purchase of grain was more than 606,000 jin, accounting for 123.4% of last year's actual purchase, an increase of more than 115,000 jin. In this way, the cooperative still retained 10% of the surplus grain as reserve grain, which could also meet the farmers' demand for eating more wheat.

After the preliminary determination of the procurement task, the township people's committee was convened for specific discussion, and the accounts of grain retention, increased production, and diligence and thrift were repeatedly calculated, so that everyone unanimously realized that the procurement grain was reasonable and the retention amount was also appropriate; the more production increased, the larger the retention amount would be. The cooperative cadres happily accepted the task and hurriedly arranged for publicity, pre-delivery preparation work, and each cooperative also put forward the slogan "No bad grain leaves the village, and tasks are completed early," challenging and responding to each other to ensure that grain was delivered to the warehouse on schedule.

### 交代政策　解除顾虑　核实产量　合理征购  武山县东顺乡粮食征购工作做得好  今年征购粮比去年虽有增加，群众仍然保证“坏粮不出庄、任务早入仓”

    交代政策　解除顾虑　核实产量　合理征购
    武山县东顺乡粮食征购工作做得好
    今年征购粮比去年虽有增加，群众仍然保证“坏粮不出庄、任务早入仓”
    本报讯　甘肃日报消息：武山县从5月26日至6月22日在东顺乡进行1957年粮食征购工作中，采取夏粮预分和征、购粮三结合统一布置的办法，针对干部、群众的思想顾虑，反复交代政策，全面照顾国家、农业社和社员三方面的利益，从而使粮食征购工作顺利进行，社干愉快接受任务，社员满意。
    东顺乡去年是丰收年，今年是增产年。但在粮食征购工作开始宣传初期，不少干部、群众有顾虑：有些社干怕多购粮，故意叫喊减产；有的对增产必须增购的政策不了解。社员之间，劳动强的埋怨不能多分粮，说小孩多的占了便宜；有的怕完成国家征购任务，社内分的粮少。
    针对群众思想进行政治教育
    针对群众的各种顾虑，工作组召开了各种会议，利用各种宣传工具，通过具体事例，全面讲清征购政策原则和增产增购的意义，说明征粮调整产量、税制税率变更的意义和好处。同时又反复说明征购政策中具体问题的处理原则和工作办法，特别讲清按劳分配的原则和按人定量分粮的办法（按劳分配指的是社员的总收入，不能单纯体现多分粮食），消除了群众怕分配不及时，怕满足不了基本需要的顾虑。在宣传中结合检查了过去按劳分粮和按人口平均分粮的缺点，结果多数人认为：实行以人定量的分粮办法最合理，一致主张在总的不超过“三定”留粮标准内，按大小人、劳力强弱分等定量进行分粮。
    与此同时，还具体算了五笔账：生产和生活改善账，国家对农民援助账，工农业互相支援账，今年增产丰收账，生活改善必须服从生产发展的账。算清这五笔账，使农民知道公粮负担并不重，粮食统购统销政策是促进农业生产和改善人民生活的重要措施，应该认真贯彻执行。
    在调查的基础上评产定案
    评定常年产量和正确估计今年实产量，是做好征购工作最重要的环节。
    东顺乡工作组在加强宣传教育的同时，做了许多细致的调查研究工作。全面调查和登记了社内人口、土地、耕畜等变动情况，搜集去年各社征购粮食册籍，作为核对今年资料的依据。对包产田和产量，深入现场进行估产和登记。将这三方面的材料汇总后，互相对照，弄清增减变化，查明原因。经过实事求是的深入调查，掌握了常产和实产情况，做到心中有数。然后采取“四对照”（去年实产，今年估产，三定时定产和原通产相互对照）的办法，选择标准亩，确定调整幅度，从而使改订后的产量达到合理。
    征购粮虽比去年增加
    干部和群众仍然满意
    在评产定案的基础上，开始计征计购。为便于确定税率，平衡负担，征购分别计算。先计算定购，后计算增购，最后分析衡量进行调整，全面照顾国家、农业社和社员三方面的利益。东顺乡实征公粮和地方自筹粮（按15％计算）比去年超三万零三十四斤，提高了16％，每亩平均负担十六斤。购粮根据“三定”基础不变和增产增购40％的原则，定产退除“四留”（按实有人口、实有牲畜留口粮、饲料，按下年实播面积留种籽，公粮按实征数退留）后，余粮按90％购率计购；实际共购粮六十万零六千多斤，占去年实购数的123.4％，增加了十一万五千多斤。这样，社内还留有10％的余粮做为机动粮，还可满足农民多吃小麦的要求。
    征购任务初步确定后，召开乡人民委员会具体讨论，反复算了留粮账、增产账和勤俭节约账，使大家一致认识到征购粮合理，留量也恰当；只要增产越多，留量就越大。社干愉快的接受任务，赶忙布置宣传预交准备工作，各社还提出“坏粮不出庄、任务早入仓”的口号，互相挑战应战，保证按期送粮入仓。
