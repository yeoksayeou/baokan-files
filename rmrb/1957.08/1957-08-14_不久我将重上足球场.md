Editor's Note: Comrade Shi Wanchun is a famous football player in our country. He is agile, resourceful, and good at shooting. He was selected as the center forward for our country's Olympic team. Last December, in an exhibition match between the Olympic team and the Shanghai team in Guangzhou, he unfortunately collided with the Shanghai team's goalkeeper, breaking his right leg. After the news of Shi Wanchun's injury spread, our newspaper received many letters from readers inquiring about his injury. We have specially asked Comrade Shi Wanchun to write this article to report his recent situation to everyone.

Since I was injured in Guangzhou last December, I have received the kind care and meticulous attention from the Party and comrades. After more than eight months of treatment and recuperation, life has been very pleasant, and my leg injury has been improving day by day. According to the current examination and practice situation, after a short period of practice, I will be able to participate in official competitions in October!

I returned to Beijing at the end of March. At that time, I walked with a slight limp and couldn't run. After returning, I started light recovery activities, mainly practicing race walking, gradually increasing from 400 meters to 1,600 meters, practicing twice a day. In addition, I did some gymnastics to help the knee and wrist joints move—such as squatting and circling movements (gymnastics is an indispensable activity for me before each practice or after getting up).

Normal work and rest times and living system allowed me to start light running and light jumping on the sandpit or sawdust track in early June. At the same time, I could also do some simple movements such as shooting and passing with little force. By the end of June, I had already been able to try some turning runs, backward runs, and variable speed runs that are necessary in the game. At the same time, I could also use maximum force to kick dangerous aerial balls, ground balls, and other movements.

I had an X-ray examination in July, and there were no problems with the fracture site. Therefore, from August, I increased physical fitness exercises, doing two 300-meter medium-speed runs and five 20-meter short-distance sprints every morning after getting up, and single-leg alternating jumps fifty times.

In the past, I heard doctors say that swimming can help the ankle recover its activity. Therefore, although I am a layman in swimming, I often learn to swim with Wang Lu, Nian Weisi and others in the morning since the beginning of summer. After two weeks of hard work, I can now swim more than ten meters freestyle.

In early July, the leadership gave me a new task: to serve as a football instructor for a summer student short-term sports training class. Now, every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoon, I practice basic techniques with the students or have team competitions. This is also a good exercise for me, enabling me to improve in all aspects.

Based on my health and training results, I estimate that in just over a month, I will be able to put on my football shoes again and meet with my comrades on the field. At that time, I will do my best to thank my comrades for their concern.

### 不久我将重上足球场

    不久我将重上足球场
  　史万春
    编者按　史万春同志是我国著名的足球运动员。他的动作灵活、机智，擅长射门，曾被选为我国奥运会代表队中锋。去年12月，奥运会代表队对上海队在广州的一场表演比赛中，他不慎与上海队守门员对撞，右腿折断。史万春受伤消息传出后，本报曾接到不少读者来信询问他的伤势。我们特地请史万春同志写了这篇文章，将他的近况报告大家。
    去年12月我在广州负伤以后，得到了党和同志们的亲切关怀与无微不至的照顾。经过八个多月的治疗和休养，生活过得非常愉快，腿的伤势一天天在好转。根据目前的检查和练习情况，再经过一个短时间的练习，到10月份我便可以参加正式比赛啦！
    我是在3月底回到北京的，当时走路腿有些跛，不能跑。回来后就开始了轻微的恢复性活动，主要是练习竞走，从四百公尺逐渐增加到一千六百公尺，每天练习两次；另外作一些帮助膝腕关节活动的体操——像曲蹲、绕环等动作（体操是我每次练习前或起床后不可缺少的活动）。
    正常的作息时间与生活制度，使我在6月初就可以开始轻微的跑动和在沙坑或锯末跑道上轻微地跳动，同时也可以作一些力量不大的射门、传球等简单动作。到6月底我已经可以试做一些在比赛中必需的转身跑动，向后退跑、与变速跑等动作，同时也可以用最大的力量作一些踢险空球，地面滚来的球等动作。
    7月份我曾检查透视一次，骨折部位已毫无问题。所以从8月份开始增加了体能方面的练习，每天早上起床后作二次三百公尺中速度跑，五次二十公尺短距离冲刺，单腿交换弹跳五十次。
    过去听医生说，游泳可以帮助脚腕恢复活动，因此，虽然我对游泳是个外行，但入夏以来我常在上午与王陆、年维泗等一起学习游泳，经过两星期的努力，现在我已可以用自由泳游十多公尺了。
    7月初，领导上曾交给了我一新的任务：让我担任一个暑期学生短期体育训练班的足球指导。现在每逢星期一、三、五下午就与同学们一起练习基本技术，或分队比赛。这对我也是一个很好的锻练，使我在各方面都能得到提高。
    根据我的健康情况和锻练结果估计，再过一个多月我便可以重新穿上足球鞋，在球场上与同志们见面了，那时我将尽最大的努力来答谢同志们对我的关怀。
