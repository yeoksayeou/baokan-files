　　Small and Medium Cities' Rightists
　　Brokers Peddling Zhang Bojun's Private Goods
　　This member of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, who was also a member of the Shanxi Shuoxian County Political Consultative Conference Standing Committee and Deputy Director of the Finance Bureau, actively engaged in activities during the Great Blooming and Letting Contend campaign, promoting the private goods of the Zhang Bojun group everywhere. At a symposium held by the county party committee on June 10, he shouted, "If non-Party members are to have power and position, the party groups in the bureaus should be abolished." This rightist also incited transferred cadres in the bureau to make trouble and oppose the Communist Party.
　　After the anti-Rightist struggle began, this anti-communist stalwart either lay in bed pretending to be sick, or went out early and returned late, wandering the streets; or cried loudly to gain sympathy; or threatened others, saying he would go to Beijing to appeal. But these tricks were exposed. People warned him that bowing his head and admitting his guilt was the only right path, and that no other path would work.
　　Landlord Element Who Infiltrated the Party for More Than Ten Years
　　Li Gu is the Deputy Director of the Grain Bureau of the Xinxiang Prefectural Commissioner's Office in Henan. He came from a landlord family. Although he has been a member of the party for more than ten years, his nature has not changed, and he always wants to seek benefits for his landlord family. During the land reform in 1946, poor peasants divided his family's land and some of their houses. This "party member" became dissatisfied with the party. During this Great Blooming and Letting Contend campaign, Li Gu openly proposed to the Grain Bureau party group that he wanted to settle the "old scores" from the land reform. All the cadres of the Grain Bureau recently engaged in a reasoning struggle with him. Everyone pointed out that the reason he hated the party and wanted to settle "old scores" was because the party could no longer allow him to live the landlord's life of not working for a living. Li Gu was refuted into silence and is now beginning to bow his head and admit his guilt.
　　Lee Zhengxiu Who Speaks Nonsense
　　Li Zhengxiu is a price clerk at the Jinnan Industrial Equipment Wholesale Station in Shanxi. During the Blooming and Letting Contend period, this rightist fabricated rumors and slandered everywhere, saying that those who are officials now are also for "promotion and wealth"; that the current legal advisors and lawyers cannot represent the people; and that the relationship between China and the Soviet Union is a "master-servant relationship". There were many such remarks. These reactionary remarks have now been completely refuted by the staff of this wholesale station.

　　中小城市的右派分子
　  批卖章伯钧私货的掮客
    这位身为山西朔县政协常委、财政局副局长的农工民主党党员在大鸣大放中积极活动，到处推销章伯钧集团的私货。他在6月10日县委召开的座谈会上大叫：“要想给非党人士有职有权，就应取消局里的党组。”这个右派分子还煽动局内转业干部起来闹事，反对共产党。
    反右派斗争开始后，这位反共健将或是躺在床上装病，或是早出晚归，溜大街；或是放声痛哭，争取同情；或是威胁别人，说要上北京控诉。但这些花招都被人拆穿了。人们正告他，低头认罪是唯一正路，别的路都走不通的。
    混入党内十多年的地主分子
    李谷是河南新乡专署的粮食局副局长，地主家庭出身，虽然入党十多年了，可是本性不改，处处想给自己的地主家庭谋利益。1946年土地改革时，贫苦农民分了他家的土地和一部分房屋，这个“党员”就对党不满起来。这次大鸣大放中，李谷便公开向粮食局党组提出要算一算土改时的“旧账”。粮食局全体干部最近和他展开了说理斗争。大家指出了他所以痛恨党所以要算“旧账”是因为党不能让他再过不劳而获的地主生活。李谷被驳得哑口无言，现在开始低头认罪了。
      信口雌黄的李正修
    李正修是山西晋南工业器材批发站一个物价员。在鸣放期间，这个右派分子到处造谣污蔑，说：现在做官的人也是为了“升官发财”；现在的法律顾问和律师不能代表人民；中国和苏联是“主仆关系”。如此之类的话很多。这些反动言论现在已被这个批发站的职工驳得一干二净。
