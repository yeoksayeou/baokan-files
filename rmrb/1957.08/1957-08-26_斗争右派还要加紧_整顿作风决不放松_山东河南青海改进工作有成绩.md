Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 25th: Shandong provincial-level agencies are actively improving their work in the rectification movement.

　　The leading cadres of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee have initially established a system for going to the countryside and factories to conduct investigations and research. Cadres of various departments, commissions, and bureaus also regularly form work groups and teams to go deep into the grassroots to understand the situation and guide the work. Since late May, the Political and Legal Work Department of the Provincial Party Committee has dispatched in batches more than 470 political and legal cadres from various units directly under the province to various places to study the political and legal work of county-level and grassroots units. In the past, the Provincial Department of Industry sometimes formulated local industrial production plans that were not realistic. The masses criticized this during the rectification movement, and the leadership has now made improvements.

　　Many units have also improved the handling of people's letters and reception of people's visits. The staff of the People's Letters Group of the General Office of the Provincial Party Committee has increased from the original six to sixteen. According to statistics from June 10th to August 10th, a total of 2,501 letters from the people were received. These letters are generally processed within two or three days, and important letters are compiled into "Selected Key Points of Letters" and sent to the secretaries and standing committee members of the Provincial Party Committee for review. During this period, 204 visitors were also received. Now, the secretaries of the Secretariat of the Provincial Party Committee, the governor and deputy governors, and other responsible cadres personally receive visiting masses.

　　Based on the correct opinions put forward by the masses, many units have also solved some important work problems. In order to improve the level of teachers throughout the province, the Provincial Department of Education has decided to change the Shandong Provincial Accelerated Teacher Training College into a teacher training college. On September 1st, hundreds of in-service teachers will come to this college for further study. At the same time, the Department of Education, according to the requirements of the Hui people in Jinan, also decided to add a high school class to the Shandong Hui Middle School. The Provincial Department of Commerce has also taken measures to initially solve the problem of vacations for employees of joint state-private enterprises.

　　This newspaper reports that, according to the Henan Daily, in the struggle against the Rightists, the Party organizations of the rectification units in Henan Province have seized the opportunity to improve their work and have achieved significant results. The vast majority of units have established dedicated teams to classify and prioritize the opinions put forward by the masses in the rectification movement and propose solutions. According to materials from some units directly under the province, about 40% or more of the opinions have been adopted and improved.

　　Many units have established a system for receiving cadres and masses and handling mass letters, such as: The Provincial Party Committee established a People's Letters and Visits Office, which is personally led by Secretary Yang Jue. The number of letters personally replied to by Pan Fusheng, the First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, and Zhao Wenfu, the Secretary of the Secretariat of the Provincial Party Committee, has greatly increased compared to the past, and they personally receive visiting masses. The governor, deputy governors, and the responsible persons of some departments and bureaus of the Provincial People's Committee, some special commissioner's offices, and factory and mine Party committees have also established a reception day system. Many units have abolished the special treatment of leading comrades. For example, the special cars of the governor and deputy governors are handed over for public use, and the special bicycles of department and bureau-level cadres are handed over for public use. Individual comrades who were promoted too quickly and too high voluntarily applied for demotion.

　　Many cadres regularly participate in physical labor. Since the spring, cadres from provincial-level agencies have taken turns participating in tasks such as pouring manure, digging the earth, harvesting wheat, threshing, and the recent weeding work. The Saturday volunteer labor day has basically become a system. Responsible comrades such as the secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, the governor, and the deputy governors take the lead in participating.

　　Among the opinions of the masses, more problems that have been solved are those directly related to the life and welfare of cadres, such as housing, utensils, relief, subsidies, cultural entertainment, and family members. Opinions that can be handled immediately without violating the state's principle of increasing production and practicing economy are generally handled.

　　However, some units have neglected to improve their work in the struggle against the Rightists. These units are now conducting inspections and studying measures to improve their work in accordance with the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 25th: Up to now, the provincial and municipal government agencies in Qinghai Province have processed more than 10,000 opinions put forward by the masses in the rectification movement. In solving problems, all units have generally implemented the working method of the mass line. The commercial department system classified and prioritized the opinions put forward by the masses and sorted them out. At the same time, they also convened Party branch committees or administrative meetings to study them in detail, propose solutions, and finally discuss the solutions and the original opinions together at a general meeting of all cadres to put forward supplementary and revised opinions.

　　Through timely resolution of problems, the relationship between leaders and the masses has been further strengthened, and work has been improved. The leaders of the Qinghai Provincial Department of Justice accepted the opinions of the masses, and the three directors of the department re-divided their specific responsibilities, ensuring that both rectification and business are not neglected. Section-level cadres also implemented a duty system. After the Party branch of the Qinghai Provincial Department of Supervision adopted the opinions of the masses, it made a plan to strengthen the ideological and political work of the branch. The Party branch of the Qinghai Provincial Department of Animal Husbandry also solved the problem of allowing non-Party cadres to listen to Party lectures. The Qinghai Provincial Party Committee recently vacated offices and dormitories for four units: the Xining Municipal Party Committee, the Xining Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Municipal Women's Federation, and the "Qinghai Daily" newspaper. The Provincial Party Committee also stipulated a unified system for the office equipment and furniture of offices and cadre dormitories. The Qinghai Provincial Department of Commerce system has basically solved the housing problem of employees. Some units have also merged some institutions, adjusted some cadres, and further established and improved the working system.

　　At present, the provincial and municipal government agencies are still continuing to solve some of the problems raised by the masses. Some opinions involve too wide a range and need to be carefully studied before they can be gradually resolved.

　　斗争右派还要加紧　整顿作风决不放松
　　山东河南青海改进工作有成绩
    新华社济南25日电　山东省级机关在整风运动中积极改进工作。
    中共山东省委和省人民委员会的领导干部，下乡下厂、进行调查研究的工作，已初步形成制度。各部委、厅局的干部也经常组成工作组、队深入基层了解情况，指导工作。省委政法工作部从5月下旬以来，曾分批抽调省直属机关各单位的政法干部四百七十多人到各地研究县级及基层单位的政法工作的情况。省工业厅过去在制定地方工业生产计划时有时不切合实际，整风中群众对此提出了批评，现在领导上已经有了改进。
    许多单位还改进了处理人民来信和接待人民来访工作。省委办公厅人民来信组的工作人员已由原来的六人增加到十六人。据6月10日到8月10日的统计，共收到人民来信二千五百零一件，这些信件一般在二、三天内就处理完毕，重要的来信都编成“来信选要”送省委各书记和常委批阅。在此期间，还接待了二百零四人的来访。现在，省委书记处各书记、正副省长等负责干部都亲自接待来访群众。
    根据群众提出的正确意见，不少单位还解决了一些重要的工作问题。为了提高全省教师水平，省教育厅已决定把山东省速成师范专科学校改为教师进修学院，9月1日，将有数百名在职教师到这个学院进修。同时教育厅根据济南市回民的要求，还决定在山东回民中学增设高中班。省商业厅也采取措施，初步解决了公私合营企业职工的休假问题。
    本报讯　据河南日报消息：在反右派斗争中，河南省各整风单位的党组织抓紧改进工作，已取得显著成绩。绝大多数单位都设有专职小组，对群众在整风中提出的意见进行了分类排队，提出处理意见。据省直机关部分单位的材料，已被采纳并且有了改进的，约占全部意见的40％以上。
    许多单位建立了接待干部、群众和处理群众来信日的制度，如：省委建立了人民来信来访办公室，由杨珏书记亲自负责领导。省委第一书记潘复生和省委书记处书记赵文甫等同志，亲自批复的信件比过去都大大增加，并亲自接见来访群众。省长、副省长以及省人委有的厅局、有的专署和厂矿党委的负责人，也都分别建立接待日的制度。不少单位取消了领导同志的特殊待遇。如省长、副省长的专车交公统一使用，厅、处长级干部的专用自行车交公使用。个别提级过快过高的同志自动申请降级。
    许多干部经常坚持参加体力劳动。从春天起的倒粪、掘地、收麦、打场，和最近的锄草劳动，省直机关干部都轮流参加。每星期六义务劳动日已基本形成制度。省委书记、省长、副省长等负责同志都带头参加。
    在处理群众意见中，已经解决得比较多的是和干部生活福利直接有关的问题。如住房、用具、救济、补助、文化娱乐、家属等问题。马上能办到而又不违背国家增产节约原则的意见，一般都作了处理。
    但是，也有一些单位在反右派斗争中忽视了改进工作。这些单位现在正根据省委指示，进行检查，研究改进工作的措施。
    新华社西宁25日电　青海省省、市机关单位到目前为止，已经处理了一万多件群众在整风中提出的意见。各单位在解决问题中，大都贯彻了群众路线的工作方法。商业厅系统把群众提出的意见进行分类排队，加以整理。同时还召开党的支委会或行政会议逐条详细研究，提出解决办法，最后再把解决的办法和原提意见一并在全体干部大会上进行讨论，提出补充和修改意见。
    通过及时解决问题，进一步密切了领导和群众的关系，改进了工作。青海省司法厅领导接受了群众意见，三位厅长重新进行了具体分工，作到整风、业务两不误，科长级干部也执行了值班制度。青海省监察厅党支部采纳了群众意见后，作出了加强支部思想政治工作的计划。青海省畜牧厅党支部也解决了吸收非党干部听党课的问题。中共青海省委最近给中共西宁市委、共青团西宁市委、市妇联和“青海日报”社四个单位腾出了办公室和宿舍。省委对办公室和干部宿舍的办公用具和家具等也都规定了统一使用的制度。青海省商业厅系统已经基本上解决了职工住房问题。有些单位还合并了一些机构，调整了一些干部，进一步建立和健全了工作制度。
    现在，省、市机关对群众提出的有些问题仍在继续解决，有的意见因牵涉面过广，需要慎重研究后逐步解决。
