A group of thirty-eight junior high school graduates from Dalian No. 1 Junior High School settled down in the Mucheng Station "May First" Agricultural Production Cooperative on July 28th to participate in agricultural production.

These students who joined agricultural production did so voluntarily, with the consent of their parents and the approval of the cooperative's cadres. They are all female students from the city, mostly children of workers, and some are children of cadres or Communist Party members from government offices and enterprises.

When these students arrived at the "May First" Cooperative, the farmers welcomed them enthusiastically with gongs and drums. Soon, they became acquainted with some of the young cooperative members, asking each other questions and becoming very close. The cooperative members eagerly introduced them to the cooperative's situation and helped them arrange food and lodging. That evening, the cooperative management committee convened a meeting with all the cadres in the cooperative to meet them. The director of the cooperative announced that they had been honorably accepted into the cooperative and had become members. The chief accountant distributed "labor manuals" to these new members, assigned them to labor organizations, introduced them to the cooperative's "assets," and encouraged them to work actively and strive to complete the cooperative's production plan.

Before these students left school, the school held a grand and enthusiastic farewell meeting. Yu Le, Deputy Director of the Dalian Municipal Education Bureau, encouraged the students to have the determination to overcome the various difficulties they would encounter in production and life, to humbly and sincerely learn from the farmers, and to strive to quickly master agricultural techniques and knowledge, and to obtain the glorious title of a "true farmer," and to take root in the countryside.

    大连一批女学生来到“五一”农业社
    本报讯　大连第一初中三十八名初中毕业生在7月28日到牧城驿“五一”农业生产合作社安家立户，参加农业生产。
  　这一批参加农业生产的学生，都是本人自愿，经过家长同意，合作社干部同意之后才去的。她们都是家住城市的女学生，多数是工人的子女，还有一部分是机关、企业的干部或共产党员的子女。
    这些学生到达“五一”社以后，农民们敲锣打鼓，热烈欢迎她们。不久，她们就和一些青年社员熟识了，彼此问长问短，非常亲热。社员们争先恐后地向她们介绍社里的情况，帮助她们安排食宿。当天晚间，社管理委员会召集了社内全体干部和她们见面。社主任宣布她们已被光荣地接受入社，成为社员。会计主任向这些新社员们分发了“劳动手册”，划分了劳动组织，向她们介绍了社里的“家底”，并勉励她们积极劳动，努力完成社内的生产计划。
    这批学生离校之前，学校召开了隆重热烈的欢送大会。大连市教育局副局长于乐勉励学生们要有决心克服生产上、生活上会遇到的各种困难，虚心诚恳地向农民学习，争取尽快地掌握农业技术和知识，取得一个“真正的农民”的光荣称号，在农村扎下根子。
