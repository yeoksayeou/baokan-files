    Resident Group Leader
    Ji Xuepei
    It is now eleven o'clock at night. The sky is pitch black. The overwhelming northwest wind, carrying hard, tiny grains of snow, howls wildly on the rooftops.
    The courtyard is quiet. Every window glows with light. Occasionally, one or two nurses in white coats hurry across the courtyard, disappearing in a flash.
    At this moment, two people carry a stretcher in through the gate, followed by a woman. She whispers a few words at the window of the reception room, and then hurriedly follows the stretcher across the courtyard.
    "Please stop for a moment," she calls out to the two stretcher bearers.
    The large chandelier above the corridor casts a soft light. Now, we can clearly see her appearance. She is very young, at most twenty-three or twenty-four years old. Tall, with short hair, her delicate and well-proportioned oval face has a pair of innocent, large eyes.
    But now, she is a little flustered. Without even bothering to shake off the snowflakes caught in her hair, she rushes to a door at the east end of the corridor in three steps.
    She gently knocks on the door of the "Delivery Room," and a young nurse comes out.
    "Comrade, she is probably going to have a miscarriage," she points to the bed and says, "Please examine her quickly."
    The nurse glances at the bed and says to her, "Wait a moment," and then turns and goes back into the room.
    Soon, the nurse leads an old doctor out. He bends down and gently lifts the quilt, and only then can the groaning of the woman on the bed be heard.
    The old doctor looks at the patient's face and asks, "How many months?"
    "Six… six months."
    "When did it start?"
    "To… today morning," the woman says weakly, turning her head and moaning.
    The old doctor nods, pushes the door open and says, "Carry her in."
    As she prepares to follow the stretcher into the room, the old doctor stops her and says, "You don't need to come in. We will tell you after we have examined her."
    The door closes silently again. Now, she stands anxiously alone in front of the door, twisting her hands incessantly. After a while, she bends over and peeks inside through the crack in the door, then sighs helplessly, pouting like a child.
    Soon, the two stretcher bearers come out, and she asks anxiously, "Has she been examined?"
    "We didn't see either," a man with a full, dark stubble laughs and says, "There's another door inside. We just carried her in, and they carried her further inside."
    The other, shorter man puts the stretcher down against the wall of the corridor, then sits down on a chair and takes out a cigarette.
    "We should have brought her sooner." She says, blaming herself, not looking at anyone.
    "You're talking nonsense," the short man puffs out a cloud of smoke, shaking his head and saying, "How could we have known about this?"
    "But I knew," she flicks her hair back and says to the short man, "I went to her house this morning, and she said her stomach was uncomfortable and her back hurt; but I didn't pay attention, I just told her to lie down and rest. This afternoon I was busy again…"
    Just then, a light footstep sounds inside the room. She stops talking immediately and turns around, running to the door.
    But the door doesn't open. The footsteps gradually disappear. She peeks inside again from the crack in the door, then turns back, frowning and saying, "Why is it taking so long?"
    The wind continues to howl in the courtyard. Suddenly, the windows rattle, followed by a louder, more violent thumping.
    "Ah—choo!" She sneezes.
    "Qi Jinglan, you're wearing too little," the man with the full, dark stubble says, looking at her and smiling, "You'll catch a cold."
    Now we know her name is Qi Jinglan. Qi Jinglan folds the front of her cloth shirt over and fastens it tightly, saying, "It's okay. I was flustered when I came and forgot to put on my coat."
      The short man throws the cigarette butt on the ground and stamps it out, asking, "Is it alright to leave your child alone at home?"
    "Her grandmother came from the countryside yesterday," Qi Jinglan says, smiling, "She's taking care of her."
    Just then, the door opens. They all rush forward.
    The old doctor asks, "Who are the patient's relatives?"
    "None of us are," Qi Jinglan answers quickly, "These two are residents from the street, here to help. I am the resident group leader from our street."
    "Ah, I see," the old doctor pauses for a moment, then asks, "Doesn't she have anyone else at home?"
    "She has a five-year-old child," Qi Jinglan says, "Her husband works at the grain bureau on the other side of the river, he even came across the river to see her the day before yesterday."
    "Do you know the phone number of her husband's office?"
    "I know it, what for?" Qi Jinglan asks, her eyes wide, breathing quickly.
    "It's like this," the old doctor takes a step forward, pointing to the palm of his left hand with the index finger of his right hand, saying, "The fetus has been dead in her womb for more than a month, and now we must immediately perform an operation to remove the fetus. This requires her relative to sign."
    Qi Jinglan swallows and looks at the old doctor's face, asking, "Are you saying you have to cut open her stomach?"
    The old doctor nods.
    "Is there no other way?"
    The old doctor smiles and says, "No. You know, she's not at full term, and the fetus is dead, so the only way is to remove it."
    She lowers her head, thinking for a long time, and says to the doctor, "It's best not to call her husband. Think about it: anyway, he can't cross the river now, wouldn't he be terribly worried if he knew?"
    The old doctor thinks for a moment and says, "What you say is true. However, such an operation requires a relative to sign, you know, that's our policy."
    "This…" She bites her lip in difficulty, thinking for a long time, and then asks the doctor, "Is it very dangerous?"
    "The risk isn't great." The old doctor pauses and then says, "However, we will do everything we can to ensure her safety."
    Now, her heart is like the river, with waves crashing and turning as she thinks: Should I sign instead? Human life is important. If I don't sign, am I just watching someone suffer? …Of course, it's best to call her husband. But what can he do besides agree to sign? …
    "It's enough for one person to suffer, I can't let him go crazy with worry too."
    Thinking of this, she asks the doctor again, "Is there really no other way?"
    The old doctor shakes his head.
    "Can I sign?" After a pause, she looks at the old doctor's face and asks. She adds quickly, "I am the resident group leader…"
    The old doctor is clearly a little surprised, looking at her and asking, "You?"
    "Yes!" Qi Jinglan nods, her eyes still fixed on the old doctor's face.
    The old doctor thinks for a moment, and finally nods, saying:
  "Okay, come with me." With that, he turns and goes back into the room.
    Qi Jinglan turns to the man with the full, dark stubble and says, "Go back and take her child to my house, and ask my mother to take good care of him. Also, tell my mother that I may be back very late, and tell them not to wait for me."
    After the two stretcher bearers leave, she pulls her cloth shirt down, feeling how cold the weather is.

    居民组长
    吉学霈
    现在是夜里十一点钟。天乌黑。漫天的西北风，卷着硬丁丁的碎雪粒，撒泼似的在房顶上吼叫着。
    院子里静悄悄的。每一个窗子上都闪着亮光。间或有一两个穿白衣服的护士从院里匆匆穿过，只一晃，就不见了。
    这时，有两个人抬着一副吊床从门口走进来，后面跟着一个女的。她在传达室的窗口轻轻说了几句，随即就跟在吊床后面，急急的穿过院子。
    “你们稍停一下”，她招呼着那两个抬吊床的人。
    走廊上面的大吊灯，发出柔和的亮光。这时，我们才能清楚的看见她的模样。她很年轻，最多也不过二十三四岁样子。高个子，短头发，清秀而又匀称的蛋圆型的脸上，有着一双稚气的大眼。
    但是，她现在有点慌张。连头发中间夹着的雪粒都没顾得抖一下，三步两步就跑到走廊东头的一个门口了。
    她轻轻地敲开了“临产室”的房门，一个年轻的女护士走出来。
    “同志，她恐怕是要流产了，”她指了指床上说：“请你们赶快给她检查一下。”
    女护士向床上看了一眼对她说：“你等一等”，随即转身进屋去了。
    不多时，女护士引着一位老大夫走出来。他弯下腰轻轻的揭开被子，才听见床上的产妇在呻吟。
    老大夫看看产妇的脸色，问：“几个月了？”
    “六……六个月。”
    “什么时候开始发作的？”
    “今……今天上午”，产妇无力的扭下头，哼着说。
    老大夫点了一下头，把门推开说：“抬进去吧。”
    当她预备跟着吊床进屋时，老大夫把她拦住了，对她说：“你不用进去啦，等我们检查完了，就会告诉你的。”
    门又无声的合上了。现在，她一个人不安的站在屋门，两只手在不断的扭着。过一会，她就弯着腰从门缝里往里面看看，然后无可奈何的叹口气，孩子气的?着嘴唇。
    不多时，那两个抬吊床的人出来了，她就慌张地问：“检查了吗？”
    “我们也没看见”，一个满脸长着黑胡楂子的人笑了笑说：“里面还有一道门呢。我们只抬进去，人家就又抬到里面去了。”
    另一个矮个子人把吊床顺着走廊的墙根放下，然后坐在椅子上，掏出一支烟。
    “我们应该把她早些送来的”。她谁也没看，埋怨着说。
    “你这是说傻话”，矮个子喷出一团浓烟，晃着头说：“这种事，我们怎么会知道？”
    “可我知道”，她把头发往后一甩，对矮个子说：“上午我到她家里去过，她说肚子不舒服，腰疼；但是我没留意，只是劝她躺一躺。下午又忙着……”
    正在这时，屋里面响起一阵轻轻的脚步声，她话没说完就赶紧一转身，跑到屋门跟前去。
    可是屋门没有开。脚步声也渐渐消失了。她又从门缝里往里面看了看，转回身来皱着眉头说：“怎么这样慢？”
    风，仍在院里呜呜叫着。突然窗子上唰拉拉响了一阵，接着就更厉害的匡咚咚震起来了。
    “呵——?！”她打了个喷嚏。
    “齐景兰，你穿的太薄了，”满脸黑胡楂子的人看着她笑着说：“要伤风的。”
    现在我们才知道她叫齐景兰。齐景兰把布衫的大襟叠了一折，紧紧扣着说：“不要紧。我来的时候慌了，忘记穿大衣。”
      矮个子把烟头丢在地下，用脚踩着问：“你那个孩子一个人留在家里行吗？”
    “她佬佬昨天从乡下来了，”齐景兰笑着说：“有她照顾着呢。”
    正在这时，屋门开了。她们都一齐迎上去。
    老大夫问了：“你们谁是病人的亲属？”
    “都不是，”齐景兰抢着回答：“他们两个是街道上的居民，来帮忙的。我是我们街道上的居民小组长”。
    “啊，是这样，”老大夫沉吟了一下，接着问：“她家里没有别的人吗？”
    “有个五岁的孩子，”齐景兰说：“她爱人在江那边粮食局作事，前天还过江来看她呢。”
    “你知道她爱人机关里的电话号码吗？”
    “知道，做什么？”齐景兰瞪着眼睛，紧促的喘着气。
    “是这样”，老大夫往前走了一步，用右手的食指点着左手的掌心说：“胎儿已经死在肚里一个多月了，现在必须马上动手术把胎儿取出来。这必须要她的亲属签字。”
    齐景兰咽了口唾沫，看着老大夫的脸问：“你是说要剖肚子吗？”
    老大夫点点头。
    “再没有别的办法了吗？”
    老大夫笑了笑说：“没有了。你知道，她不够月，胎儿又是死的，只有把它取出来。”
    她低着头，想了半天，对大夫说：“最好还是不给她的爱人打电话。你想：反正他现在已经不能过江来了，他知道了不要急坏了吗？”
    老大夫想了想说：“你这话原是不错的。不过，动这样的手术是需要有她的亲属签字的，你知道，这是我们的制度。”
    “这……”她为难的咬着嘴唇，想了半天，又问大夫：“很危险吗？”
    “危险性不大。”老大夫停了停接着说：“不过，我们会想尽一切办法使她平安的。”
    现在，她的心就像江水一样，翻波倒浪的在想：自己代替签字吗？人命关系是重大的。不签吗？眼看着一个人在受罪。……当然，最好是打个电话问一下她的爱人。但是，他除了同意签字以外还有什么办法呢？……
    “一个人受罪就行了，我不能让他也跟着急疯了。”
    想到这里，她又问大夫：“当真没有别的办法了吗？”
    老大夫摇摇头。
    “我签字行吗？”停了停，她看着老大夫的脸问。紧跟着补充说：“我是居民小组长。……”
    老大夫显然有点吃惊，看着她问：“你？”
    “嗯！”齐景兰点下头，眼睛仍盯着老大夫的脸。
    老大夫想了想，终于点下头说：
  “好，你跟我来吧。”说罢，转身进屋去了。
    齐景兰转身对那个满脸黑胡楂子的人说：“你回去把她的孩子送到我家里，叫我妈妈好好照顾他。另外，你对我妈妈讲，我可能回去的很晚，叫她们不用等我了。”
    等那两个抬吊床的人走了以后，她这才把布衫往下拉了拉，感到天气是如此的冷。
