On Beating "Dogs in the Water" Does Not Violate the Doctrine of Loyalty and Kindness
Gu Yan

"The Chinese are good at beating dogs in the water." This is what Teng Baiye, a rightist in Shanghai, wrote in a letter to another rightist, Chen Renbing. The words "dog in the water" sound harsh, but there is no other way, because this is the true face of the rightists.

Indeed, the Chinese are good at beating dogs in the water. This is not because we are inherently "unbenevolent," but simply because we have suffered enough from not beating dogs in the water. The Chinese have always been loyal and kind. A brave boxer will never hit a downed opponent again; once a truce flag is raised, they will never break into the city and pursue the remaining enemy. Loyal and kind people always believe that their opponents are also loyal and kind, and they have never been "envious of evil as if it were an enemy." However, those who are "envious of good as if it were an enemy" do not decrease because of this. Often, "because of the good intentions of the martyrs and the compassion for ghosts and monsters, they multiply, and the enlightened youth who come after must expend more and more energy and life to resist the darkness." [Note] Mr. Dongguo rescued a wolf from the hunter. It was truly a heart of compassion, so loyal and kind. Who knew that after being rescued, the wolf would turn around and try to swallow Mr. Dongguo.

I don't know if Mr. Dongguo actually existed, but I understand that this is a lesson learned after summarizing many painful experiences.

Let's go back to the dogs in the water. Dogs on the shore bite people, and they are very snobbish. Sometimes, loyal and kind people advocate beating down their arrogance, but once they fall into the water, they pretend to be pitiful. Loyal and kind people then think that they must have repented this time, so there is no need to be "overly hasty." Thus, their hearts soften, and they cannot bring themselves to strike. Little do they know that "dogs can float, and they will definitely climb back to the shore. If you are not careful, they will first shake themselves, splashing water all over people's faces," [Note] and later their nature remains unchanged. Given the opportunity, they will still bark madly and bite people. At this point, loyal and kind people have no choice but to reverse their doctrine of loyalty and kindness and advocate beating down their arrogance again. However, this is not only more troublesome than before, but even "requires more and more energy and life."

To the true loyal and kind people, we should explain this principle clearly, so that they understand that beating dogs in the water does not violate the doctrine of loyalty and kindness. Showing warmth to dogs in the water may seem like loyalty and kindness, but it is actually the greatest cruelty. Because if dogs in the water are not beaten, they will climb ashore and not only splash sewage all over people, but will still bite people, and even loyal and kind people themselves will inevitably be bitten. Therefore, being kind to dogs in the water is actually being ruthless to those who have been bitten or will be bitten in the future. However, there are also some so-called loyal and kind people who appear to be loyal and kind, but are actually harboring ulterior motives. Loyalty and kindness are just a disguise. They are originally of the same kind as the dogs in the water, hoping that people will show mercy to the dogs in the water, not only to protect their own kind, but also to protect themselves, so that they can finally unite and launch a vicious counterattack. For these so-called loyal and kind people, we must expose their disguise and reveal their true colors.

Aren't the rightists calling themselves dogs in the water? That's right, we are going to beat the dogs in the water. Not only are we going to beat them, but we are going to beat them hard. In order to help the rightists "get ashore" and become new people, we will never spare effort and time until they change their biting nature.

    论打“落水狗”并不违反忠厚之道
    顾言
    “中国人善打落水狗”，这是上海的右派分子滕白也写给另一个右派分子陈仁炳的信里面的话。落水狗三字听来刺耳，然而也没有办法，因为这是右派分子们的本来的面目。
    不错，中国人善打落水狗。这并非我们秉性不“仁”，而只是因为我们吃够了不打落水狗的苦头。中国人素来忠厚，刚勇的拳师就决不再打那倒地的对手；免战牌一挂，就决不破城而入，乘胜追击那残余的敌人。忠厚人总以为对手也是忠厚之辈，向来是并不“嫉恶如仇”的。但是，“嫉善如仇”的人却并不因此而减少，往往“因为先烈的好心，对于鬼蜮的慈悲，使它们繁殖起来，而此后的明白青年，为反抗黑暗计，也就要花费更多更多的气力和生命”。〔注〕东郭先生从猎人手下把狼救了出来，真是一片恻隐之心，忠厚得可以了，谁知狼得救后，却转而要吞掉东郭先生。
    我不知道是否确有东郭先生其人，然而我明白，这是总结了多少惨痛的经历以后才得出的教训。
    回头再说落水狗。狗在岸上要咬人，而且势利得很，忠厚人有时也主张打下它的威风来，然而一经落水，又装出可怜相，忠厚人就以为此番一定悔改，不必“操之过急”了，于是心一软，手就打不下去。殊不知“狗是能浮水的，一定仍要爬到岸上，倘不注意，它先就耸身一摇，将水点洒得人们一身一脸”，〔注〕而后来性情还是不变，一有机会，还是要狂吠，要咬人。到了此时，忠厚人也只好一反忠厚之道，主张再打下它的威风来，不过，这不但比前费事，甚至“要花费更多更多的气力和生命”。
    对真正的忠厚人，我们应当说清楚这个道理，让他们懂得打落水狗并不违反忠厚之道。对落水狗温情，看来仿佛忠厚，其实却是最大的残忍。因为落水狗不打，爬上岸来，不但要将污水点洒得人们一身一脸，而且依然要咬人，连忠厚人自己也不免要被咬一口。所以，对落水狗有情，其实就是对那曾经被咬过、或者以后会被咬的人的无情。但是，另外还有一些所谓忠厚人，他们貌似忠厚，其实心怀叵测，忠厚只不过是一层伪装；他们原是落水狗的同类，希望人们对落水狗手下留情，不只是为了保护同类，也是为了保护自己，以便他们最后并合起来进行凶恶的反扑。对于这些所谓忠厚人，我们就要揭穿他们的伪装，露出他们的真实面目来。
    右派分子不是自封为落水狗的吗，一点不错，我们正是要打落水狗。不但要打，而且要狠狠地打。为了帮助右派分子“上岸”重新做人，在他们没有改掉咬人的本性以前，我们是决不吝惜气力和时间的。
    〔注〕这两段话引自鲁迅：“论‘费厄泼赖’应该缓行”，见鲁迅全集（人民文学出版社版）第一卷。
