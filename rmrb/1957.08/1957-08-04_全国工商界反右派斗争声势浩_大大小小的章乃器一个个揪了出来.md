Xinhua News Agency, August 3rd: Xinhua News Agency reporters Lin Yao and Feng Jian summarized the situation of the anti-Rightist struggle in industrial and commercial circles nationwide, saying: According to reports recently received by the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, a mass movement of the anti-Rightist struggle in industrial and commercial circles nationwide, under the leadership of local Party and government departments, has been launched in eight major cities and more than one hundred medium and small cities in twenty-four provinces and autonomous regions across the country.

The anti-Rightist struggle in industrial and commercial circles nationwide began on June 12, when the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Standing Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association decided to criticize Zhang Naiki's reactionary words and deeds. It gradually expanded to major and medium cities across the country, and even to some small cities. Over the past month, a number of Rightist elements and Rightist small groups who attacked the Party and socialism in various aspects have been successively exposed in various places. For example, in Beijing, more than ten meetings have been held continuously since June 18 to expose and criticize the reactionary words and deeds of Rightist elements such as Liu Yifeng, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, Yan Shaoqing, Standing Committee Member of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, Wu Jincui, Deputy Director of Yushengxiang Electrical Machinery Plant, and Zhang Huanyao, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association. Rightist elements exposed in Shanghai include Wang Junliang, Deputy Manager of the Shanghai Cotton Textile Industry Company, and Huang Miaofu, Private Manager of the New Modern Laoying Textbook Arts and Crafts Cooperative. The vast number of industrialists and businessmen in Tianjin launched a resolute struggle against Bi Mingqi, Chairman of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce and a Rightist element, and at the same time criticized Rong Zizheng, Standing Committee Member of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce and a Rightist element. Wuhan exposed and criticized Wang Yiming, Chairman of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce and a Rightist element, the "Manager of the Zhang Family Store Wuhan Branch," who peddled a large number of Zhang Naiki's poisons in Wuhan's industrial and commercial circles. Among the Rightist elements in industrial and commercial circles exposed in various places, there are also some landlord elements or "gentry" who have consistently sucked the blood and sweat of farmers and committed many crimes. For example, Peng Yihu, Deputy Director of the Counselor's Office of the Wuhan Municipal People's Committee and Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, Yang Kecheng, Director of the Kunming Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, and Qian Sunqing, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, have always harbored strong dissatisfaction with the People's Government's policies on land reform and the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. This time, they took the opportunity of helping the Party rectify its work style to launch a rampant attack on the Party. Some places have also exposed some Rightist small groups, such as the small group cultivated by Zhang Naiki within the Standing Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, which peddled capitalist goods, attacked progressive forces and Communist Party members within the association, and carried out many criminal activities. Liu Dongye, Chairman of the Fuzhou Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, installed his cronies within the Federation of Industry and Commerce, organized a so-called "core leading group," and controlled the leadership of the local industrial and commercial circles. In addition, the Rightist elements that have been exposed also include: Yuan Xijian and Ge Lansheng in Shandong Province; Gao Zhensheng in Hebei Province; Li Zhongping and Kang Xinru in Sichuan Province; Shen Jiru and Xu Zuchao in Zhejiang Province; Mei Lingxian in Guizhou Province; Huang Yingshi in Hunan Province; Zhang Shanrui and Zhang Dongye in Anhui Province; Luo Shiyang in Jiangxi Province; Zhang Shixin in Xi'an; Wang Ziren and Qi Xin in Shenyang; and Huang Yuanji in Qingdao, etc.

These scum in industrial and commercial circles in various places, like ants trying to shake a big tree, vainly attempted to shake the leadership of the Communist Party and shake our country's socialist system. Their anti-Communist and anti-socialist words and deeds had already been exposed to some extent since the nationwide public-private partnership of capitalist industry and commerce was implemented in 1956. Since the Great Blooming and Great Contending, their clamor and activities have become even more rampant and blatant, and they have echoed and cooperated with each other.

The anti-Communist and anti-socialist words and deeds of the Rightist elements in industrial and commercial circles in various places are numerous. Just citing the following aspects can show their maliciousness. When Rightist elements in other fields put forward fallacies such as "the CCP organization should withdraw from organs and schools" and "please the Communist Party step down," Zhang Naiki slandered the Communist Party as "great-Party-ism" and put forward fallacies such as "bureaucracy is a more dangerous enemy than capitalism" and "in work, it is not appropriate to emphasize the boundaries between the public and private sectors, nor is it appropriate to emphasize the boundaries between Party members and non-Party members," in an attempt to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party. At this time, Bi Mingqi of Tianjin said, "As masters, there are no guests. In the socialist field, don't emphasize class relations." Wang Yiming also shamelessly claimed to be a "connoisseur of proletarian thought," and closely followed Dong Shaochen of Tianjin in openly demanding the withdrawal of public representatives from public-private joint ventures.

Zhang Naiki and other Rightist elements in industrial and commercial circles tried their best to uglify the working class and whitewash the bourgeoisie. They talked about "red capitalists," asserted that "the political and economic duality of the national bourgeoisie has been basically eliminated," and that "there is no difference between the status of capitalists and workers in the social production system today," published articles that slandered and vilified the working class, and hindered the vast number of industrialists and businessmen from further accepting socialist transformation and taking the socialist road, in an attempt to drag industrialists and businessmen back to the old road of capitalism. They deliberately portrayed public-private joint ventures as very bad, clamoring that "before joint ventures, it was as warm as spring, but after joint ventures, it is a world of terror." They described fixed interest rates as "not exploitation, but unearned income," "voluntarily paid by the working class, not demanded by capitalists," and advocated issuing nationalization bonds for public-private joint ventures and extending the term of fixed interest rates.

In coordination with their absurd remarks, these Rightist elements' anti-Communist and anti-socialist activities were also crazy. As early as May and June of last year, Zhang Naiki used the opportunity of "inspection" work by representatives of the National People's Congress to spread poison and carry out reactionary activities in industrial and commercial circles in Shanghai, Zhejiang, Hebei, Guangzhou and other places. In May of this year, Bi Mingqi also used the opportunity of "inspection" work to ignite and spread poison in some public-private joint venture factories in Tianjin, openly provoking the relationship between the People's Government and industrial and commercial circles. Huang Miaofu, a Rightist element in Shanghai, with the full support of Zhang Naiki, even distributed mimeographed reactionary pamphlets to various parts of the country three times. Xu Han’san, a Rightist element sitting inside the office of the Standing Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, used his authority to print and distribute the article by Rightist element Wu Jincui that slandered the working class and Li Kangnian's proposal for a fixed interest rate of twenty years four times in a row to local organizations of the China Democratic National Construction Association. Xu Han'san also colluded with Rightist elements in Beijing's industrial and commercial circles to hold meetings to collect information for Zhang Naiki and carry out anti-Communist and anti-socialist activities. Some lawless capitalists also took the opportunity to stir up trouble. Feng Zhu and others, the private managers of the Guangzhou public-private joint venture Yinghe Restaurant, collectively beat worker Yan Zhu severely, resulting in Yan Zhu suffering multiple injuries and being unconscious for many days. This serious illegal incident occurred during this period.

However, these Rightist elements miscalculated. Their ugly forms of monsters and demons are being exposed one by one. In the intense struggle against the Rightists in the past two months, not only have the vast number of industrialists and businessmen raised their awareness and actively participated in the struggle, but also the employees of the organs and enterprises where these Rightist elements are located, the people in the areas they have "inspected," and the farmers who have been oppressed and exploited by certain Rightist elements in the past have all angrily launched face-to-face reasoning struggles with the Rightist elements, or wrote letters to newspapers to expose them. Pointed at by ten hands, it has formed a situation where "rats crossing the street are chased and beaten by everyone." The Rightist leader Zhang Naiki has not only been exposed and criticized by leading figures in industrial and commercial circles in both the Standing Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Trade and Industry, but has also been rebuked and denounced by industrial and commercial circles in various places. At the Fourth Session of the National People's Congress, the Sichuan delegation and all the representatives of industrial and commercial circles made merciless exposures and refutations of Zhang Naiki in their speeches.

According to the person in charge of the relevant department, this anti-Rightist struggle is, in essence, a continuation of the 1956 socialist transformation climax of the industrial and commercial circles (at that time, it was mainly the socialist transformation in which the capitalist ownership of the means of production was basically changed to socialist ownership). The difference is that this time, the socialist transformation, that is, the socialist revolution, is carried out on the political and ideological fronts. At present, the struggle will continue to be carried out in depth, and at the same time, socialist education will be carried out more extensively in industrial and commercial circles so that every industrialist and businessman can receive further education and transformation from the anti-Rightist struggle.

    全国工商界反右派斗争声势浩
    大大小小的章乃器一个个揪了出来
    新华社3日讯　新华社记者林耀、冯健综述全国工商界反右派斗争的情况说：根据全国工商联最近接到的报告，全国工商界的一个声势浩大的反右派斗争的群众运动，在各地党政部门领导下，已经在全国八大城市和二十四个省、自治区的一百多个中小城市展开了。
    全国工商界的反右派斗争，是从6月12日全国工商联和民建中常会决定批判章乃器的反动言行开始的，以后逐步扩展到了全国各大、中城市以至一部分小城市。一个多月来，各地相继揭露了一批从各个方面向党、向社会主义进攻的右派分子和右派小集团。如北京市，6月18日以来连续举行了十多次会议，揭露和批判了市工商联副主任委员刘一峰、市工商联常委阎少青、裕生祥机电厂副厂长吴金萃和民建北京市委宣传处副处长张焕尧等右派分子的反动言行；上海市揭露的右派分子有市棉纺工业公司副经理汪君良和公私合营新现代劳英教材工艺社私方经理黄苗夫；天津市的广大工商业者，对市工商联主任委员、右派分子毕鸣岐展开了坚决的斗争，同时批判了市工商联常委、右派分子荣子正；武汉市揭露和批判了市工商联主任委员、右派分子王一鸣，这个“章家店武汉分店的经理”，在武汉工商界贩卖了章乃器的大批毒货。各地揭露出来的工商界右派分子中间，还有一些是一贯吮吸农民血汗、罪恶很多的地主分子或代表地主利益的“士绅”。如武汉市人民委员会参事室副主任、民建中央常务委员彭一湖、民建昆明市主任委员杨克成、江苏省工商联主任委员钱孙卿等，他们对人民政府的土地改革、资本主义工商业改造等政策，一贯怀有强烈的不满，这次利用帮助党整风的机会，向党展开了猖狂的进攻，有的地方还揭露出一些右派小集团，如章乃器在民建中常会内培植的小集团，贩卖资本主义的私货，打击会内进步力量和共产党员，进行了许多罪恶活动；福州市工商联主任委员刘栋业，在工商联内安插亲信，组织了所谓“核心领导小组”，把持当地工商界的领导权。此外，已经揭露出来的右派分子还有：山东省的袁熙鉴、葛兰生；河北省的高振声；四川省的李仲平、康心如；浙江省的沈九如、许祖潮；贵州省的梅岭先；湖南省的黄英士；安徽省的张善瑞、张东野；江西省的罗时炀；西安市的张士心；沈阳市的王子仁、齐心和青岛市的黄元吉等等。
    各地工商界的这些败类，像蚍蜉撼大树一样，妄图摇撼共产党的领导，摇撼我国的社会主义制度。他们的反共、反社会主义言行，自从1956年全国资本主义工商业实行全行业公私合营以后，已经有所暴露，大鸣大放以来，他们的叫嚣和活动就更加猖狂、更加露骨，而且相互呼应、配合。
    各地工商界右派分子的反共、反社会主义言行是很多的，只举出以下几个方面，就可以看出他们的恶毒了。当其他方面的右派分子提出“中共组织退出机关、学校”、“请共产党下台”等谬论时，章乃器就污蔑共产党是“大党主义”并提出了“官僚主义是比资本主义更危险的敌人”“在工作中，更不宜强调公方和私方的界限，也不宜强调党与非党的界限”等谬论，企图反对共产党的领导。天津的毕鸣岐这时就说，“同是主人没有客，同在社会主义领域中，不要强调什么阶级关系。”王一鸣也无耻地自命为“无产阶级思想通”，紧跟着天津的董少臣，就公然要求撤退公私合营企业里的公方代表。
    章乃器和工商界其他右派分子竭力丑化工人阶级，在资产阶级脸上擦粉涂脂。他们说什么“红色资产阶级”，断言“民族资产阶级政治上和经济上的两面性已经基本上消灭了”、“资本家和工人今天在社会生产体系中的地位是没有什么区别的”，发表谩骂、污蔑工人阶级的文章，阻挠广大的工商业者进一步接受社会主义改造，走社会主义的道路，企图把工商业者拉回到资本主义的老路上去。他们故意把公私合营企业说得很糟，叫嚣“合营前是温暖如春，合营后是恐怖世界”。他们把定息说成“不是剥削，是不劳而获的收入”、“是工人阶级自愿付出的，不是资本家要的”，主张发行公私合营企业国有化公债，延长定息年限等。
    配合着他们的荒谬言论，这些右派分子反共、反社会主义的活动也是疯狂的。早在去年5、6月，章乃器就曾借全国人民代表大会代表“视察”工作的机会，在上海、浙江、河北、广州等地工商界散布毒素，进行反动活动。今年5月，毕鸣岐也利用“视察”工作的时机，在天津市一部分公私合营工厂里点火放毒，公然挑拨人民政府和工商界的关系。上海的右派分子黄苗夫在章乃器的全力支持下，甚至向全国各地三次散发了油印的反动小册子。坐在民建中常会机关内部的右派分子许汉三，利用职权，擅自将右派分子吴金萃污蔑工人阶级的文章和李康年定息二十年的建议，一连印了四次，发给各地民建地方组织；许汉三还勾结北京市工商界右派分子，召开会议，为章乃器搜集情况，进行反共反社会主义的活动。有些不法资本家这时也趁机蠢动起来，广州公私合营应和饭店私方经理冯柱等人，集体毒打工人严焯，以致严焯浑身多处受伤、昏迷多日的严重违法事件，就是在这个时期发生的。
    但是，这些右派分子失算了。他们牛鬼蛇神的丑恶原形，正一个个地被剥露出来。在近两个月的反击右派的激烈斗争中，不仅广大工商业者提高了觉悟，积极地参加斗争，这些右派分子所在机关、企业的职工，曾经“视察”过的地区的人民，以及过去曾被某些右派分子压迫、剥削的农民，都愤怒地和右派分子展开了面对面的说理斗争，或者写信在报纸上揭露。十手所指，形成了“老鼠过街，人人喊打”的声势。右派头子章乃器不仅在民建中常会和全国工商联受到工商界领导人物的揭露和批判，而且受到各地工商界的斥责和声讨。在全国人民代表大会第四次会议上，四川代表小组和所有的工商界代表在发言中都对章乃器进行了无情的揭发和驳斥。
    据有关方面负责人对记者说，这场反右派斗争，对于工商业者来说，实质上是1956年工商界的社会主义改造高潮（当时主要是生产资料的资本主义所有制基本上改变为社会主义所有制的社会主义改造）的继续，不同的是这次主要是社会主义改造，也就是社会主义革命是在政治战线和思想战线上进行的。目前斗争将继续深入开展，同时还要更加广泛地在工商界中展开社会主义教育，使每一个工商业者都能从反右派斗争中得到进一步教育和改造。
