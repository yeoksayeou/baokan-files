　　The Most Vicious Rightist Heart
　　Zeng Tianjia

From the publicly published remarks of the rightists, it's already vicious enough. But the "private words" they say are far more malicious than what they publish publicly.

Take Zhang Yousong as an example.

This "commander-in-chief" rightist wrote more than forty secret letters to his lackeys. In these secret letters, every line is filled with boundless hatred for the Communist Party and the people. There are "calls" to battle, deployments of the "war situation," vicious attacks, and self-intoxicated smugness. In short, the face of a despicable, shameless, and extremely vicious conspirator leaps off the page! One hears his voice before even meeting the man!

　　"The battle situation is going smoothly, we are about to strike directly at Huanglong, and destroy the 'three evils' nest" - this is Zhang Yousong's purpose in "fighting."

　　"In the event of a temporary disparity between the enemy and us, we must show our determination to coexist with the position of justice" - this is Zhang Yousong's determination in "fighting."

　　"If we are fire, then it is 'a single spark can start a prairie fire.' No matter how rampant the enemy is, we must not lose confidence" - this is Zhang Yousong's belief in the "optimistic war situation."

　　"I am commanding a team from scratch, and have opened up two battlefields one after another. Now, in just over ten days, the trend of victory and defeat is already clear to me" - this is Zhang Yousong's "pride."

People clearly remember that some time ago, Zhang Yousong, under the guise of "helping the Party rectify its work style" and wearing the cloak of a translator, launched vicious attacks on the leaders of the People's Literature Publishing House, complaining about poverty and hardship, saying he was "waiting for rice to cook." But in the secret letters, he smugly referred to the royalties the publishing house advanced him as "'the chief transportation captain within the people' has sent a batch of grain and ammunition, which can be used for the needs of a protracted war." How utterly despicable and malicious, more than just repaying kindness with malice!

During the land reform, a folk song was popular: "The green bamboo snake has a mouth, the wasp has a stinger on its tail, both are still small, but the landlord's heart is the most vicious." I think it is very appropriate to change the last line of this folk song to "the most vicious rightist heart" to describe the minds of the rightists.

There is a Chinese saying: "If you see a snake and don't hit it, you are three parts guilty." Can we ignore a rightist conspirator like Zhang Yousong, who is more venomous than a poisonous snake?

Zhang Yousong challenged us, saying that he would "deal with us to the end" and "never give up." Good, we are precisely going to compete with this vicious, self-important conspirator. We will not give up until we have completely crushed his conspiracy.

### 最毒右派心

　　最毒右派心
　　曾田家
    从右派分子公开发表的言论看，已经够恶毒了。但他们说的“私房话”，却远比公开发表的恶毒得多。
    试以张友松为例。
    这个“挂帅”的右派分子向他的喽啰们写了四十多封密信。在这些密信里，字里行间，充满着对共产党和对人民的无比的仇恨。这里有战斗的“号召”，有“战局”的布署，有恶毒的攻击，也有得意忘形的自我陶醉。总之，一副卑鄙无耻穷凶极恶的阴谋家的嘴脸是跃然纸上了，真是未见其人，先闻其声！
      “战局顺利，我们就要直捣黄龙，摧毁‘三害’的巢穴”——这是张友松“作战”的目的。
      “万一暂时有敌我悬殊之势，我们就要拿出决心来，誓与正义的阵地共存亡”——这是张友松“作战”的决心。
      “如果说我们是火，那就是‘星星之火可以燎原’无论敌人怎样猖狂，我们也不要失去信心”——这是张友松对“战局乐观”的信念。
    “我指挥着由无到有的队伍，先后开辟了两个战场。现在总共不过十几天，而胜负之势，已经了如指掌了”——这是张友松的“自豪”。
    人们都清楚地记得，前些时候张友松打着“帮助党整风”的招牌，披着翻译家的外衣，向人民文学出版社的领导进行恶毒攻击，叫穷叫苦，说是“等米下锅”，而在密信里，他却得意地把出版社预支给他的稿酬说成是“‘人民内部的运输大队长’已送来一批粮弹，可供持久战之需”，真是卑鄙恶毒已极，岂止以怨报德而已！
    土地改革时流行过一首歌谣：“青竹蛇儿口，黄蜂尾上针，两般犹小可，最毒地主心”。我觉得把这歌谣的最后一句改为“最毒右派心”来形容右派分子的心肠，真是恰当极了。
    中国有句俗话：“见蛇不打三分罪”，对张友松这样的比毒蛇还毒的右派阴谋家，我们能置之不理么？
    张友松向我们挑战说，他要与我们“周旋到底”，“决不罢休”。好，我们正是要与这个狠毒的、自负不凡的阴谋家较量一下呢，不彻底粉碎他的阴谋，我们是不会罢休的。
