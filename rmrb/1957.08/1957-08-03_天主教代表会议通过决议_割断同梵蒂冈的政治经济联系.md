Xinhua News Agency, August 2nd: The Chinese Catholic Representatives Conference today unanimously passed a resolution calling on Catholics nationwide to further develop the anti-imperialist patriotic movement, resolutely run the church independently, break away from its colonial status, and unswervingly follow the socialist path.

The resolution stated that the Chinese Catholic Church must "practice independence and autonomy, be run by Chinese clergy and laity, maintain purely religious relations with the Vatican on the premise of not violating the interests and independent dignity of the motherland, and obey the Pope on matters of faith and doctrine. However, it must completely sever political and economic relations with the Vatican, and resolutely oppose any conspiracies by the Vatican to use religion to interfere in our internal affairs, infringe upon our sovereignty, and undermine our just anti-imperialist patriotic movement."

The resolution said: "The Vatican has consistently been anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist, serving the aggressive policies of American imperialism and colonialism. On the one hand, it recognizes the Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan, sending the imperialist element Li Peili, who was expelled by our government, to Taiwan to continue carrying out conspiracies to undermine New China; on the other hand, it constantly issues 'encyclicals' and 'orders' to dioceses in our country, inciting clergy and laity to oppose the People's Government and undermine the anti-imperialist patriotic movement, even using the crimes of 'apostasy' and 'schism' and means such as 'removal of priestly powers' and 'excommunication' to threaten and strike at patriotic clergy and laity, attempting to use the Chinese church as a tool for imperialism to oppose our socialist cause." The resolution stated, "We feel extremely indignant about this," and we "resolutely oppose such reactionary and unreasonable measures by the Vatican."

The resolution condemned the recent reactionary words and deeds of bourgeois right-wingers who are anti-Party and anti-socialist, and unanimously expressed their determination to wage a resolute struggle against them. The resolution called on "clergy and laity across the country to stand firm on their patriotic positions, unite as one, thoroughly expose and criticize the right-wing elements and their erroneous words and deeds within the church, resolutely draw a political line between themselves and them, raise their patriotic awareness, and actively participate in the socialist construction of the motherland and the movement to defend world peace."

    天主教代表会议通过决议
    割断同梵蒂冈的政治经济联系
    据新华社2日讯　中国天主教代表会议今天一致通过决议，号召全国天主教友进一步开展反帝爱国运动，坚决自办教会，摆脱殖民地状态，坚定不移地走社会主义的道路。
    决议说，中国天主教会必须“实行独立自主，由中国神长教友自己来办，在不违反祖国利益和独立尊严的前提下同梵蒂冈教廷保持纯宗教的关系，在当信当行的教义教规上服从教宗。但必须彻底割断政治上、经济上和梵蒂冈教廷的关系，坚决反对梵蒂冈教廷利用宗教干涉我国内政、侵犯我国主权、破坏我们正义的反帝爱国运动的任何阴谋活动”。
    决议说：“梵蒂冈教廷一贯反共反人民反社会主义，为美帝国主义和殖民主义的侵略政策服务。它一方面承认台湾蒋介石集团，派了被我国政府驱逐出境的帝国主义分子黎培里驻在台湾，继续进行破坏新中国的阴谋活动；另一方面又不断地对我国各教区发出煽动神长教友反对人民政府、破坏反帝爱国运动的‘通谕’和‘命令’，甚至以‘叛教’、‘裂教’的罪名和‘摘神权’、‘弃绝’等手段来威胁打击爱国的神长教友，力图把中国教会作为帝国主义反对我国社会主义事业的工具。”决议说，“我们对此感到无比愤慨”，我们“坚决反对梵蒂冈教廷这种反动无理的措施”。
    决议斥责了最近一个时期资产阶级右派分子反党反社会主义的反动言行，一致表示要同他们作坚决的斗争。决议号召“全国各地神长教友，站稳爱国立场，团结一致，对存在于教会内的右派分子和他们的错误言行，进行彻底的揭露和批判，坚决同他们划清政治上的界限，提高自己的爱国主义觉悟，积极参加祖国的社会主义建设事业和保卫世界和平运动。”
