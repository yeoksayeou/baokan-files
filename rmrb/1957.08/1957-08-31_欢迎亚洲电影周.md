　　Welcome to Asian Film Week
　　Yang Hansheng, Vice President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries
    Asian Film Week has opened. This is an exhibition jointly organized by the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the China Film Workers Association, including films from fourteen Asian countries, to be shown in two batches in ten major cities in China, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Changchun, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Kunming, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Nanjing. At the same time, during the Film Week, film delegations from fifteen countries, totaling more than sixty people, are invited to visit China. Some of them are leaders of national film industries, some are well-known directors and actors, and some are important figures in the film business. They will observe and exchange experiences with Chinese film workers. Thus, the Film Week is not only an initiative in the Asian film industry in terms of its nature and scale, but it will also play a significant role in the development of the film industries of Asian countries and their cultural exchanges, and in promoting mutual understanding and friendly unity among the people of Asian countries. Chinese film workers, the Chinese cultural community, and the general public have enthusiastically supported the preparation of the Film Week and regard it as a major event in their cultural life. Similarly, the film industries of various countries have provided great assistance to the holding of this Film Week. Their enthusiastic and friendly cooperation has laid the foundation for the common prosperity of the film industries of Asian countries. Now, as we celebrate the opening of the Film Week, let us extend our heartfelt thanks and congratulations to these respectable friends!
    Asian Film Week can be said to be a new cluster of flowers blooming on the deep-rooted and leafy ancient tree of Asian culture, a result of the diligent irrigation by the Asian people in recent decades. Asian countries have a long history and culture and a tradition of cultural exchange with each other, and have made their own contributions to human civilization over the past thousands of years. The Asian people are hardworking and intelligent, and their artistic creations are exquisite and appreciated by the whole world. However, since the invasion of Western colonialists, the cultures of Asian countries have mostly suffered from brutal oppression and destruction, and the cultural exchanges between countries have been undermined. However, the heroic and unyielding Asian people have never been willing to live such a humiliating life. They have been engaged in a heroic struggle for national independence for hundreds of years, and finally, good news has been frequently reported, and many countries have achieved brilliant results one after another. In recent years, the development of culture and art in Asian countries has sprung up like mushrooms after a rain, and cultural ties between countries are also rapidly recovering and constantly strengthening, all of which are extremely gratifying new phenomena.
    It is not difficult to understand that the development of culture in Asian countries and the growth of cultural relations between countries are one of the important conditions for the Asian people to obtain true freedom and happiness. In April 1955, the Asian countries conference and the Asian-African conference held successively in New Delhi and Bandung both made resolutions on cultural cooperation, encouraging the people and governments of all countries to devote themselves to activities in this regard. For more than two years, it can be seen that these resolutions have been widely valued. Taking China as an example, during this period, our art performing groups visited twelve Asian countries, and at the same time received art groups from nine Asian countries. We have held Indian and Japanese film weeks, received film representatives from India, Burma and other countries, and participated in the International Film Festival held in Damascus, the capital of Syria. We warmly supported and participated in the Asian Writers Conference held in India at the end of 1956. Now we are honored to hold this Asian Film Week and welcome film delegations from various countries to visit China. We believe that these all symbolize that cultural cooperation among Asian countries has entered a new historical era.
    The films shown in this Film Week are all excellent films recently produced by various countries. They are colorful and diverse in terms of ideological content and artistic form, and can be regarded as a "hundred flowers blooming" of Asian film art. Some of these films reflect the happy years of peaceful construction, while others depict the bleak life of hunger and cold; some praise the struggle to defend national independence and autonomy, while others resist the dark and humiliating fate. Here, people can not only view the beautiful natural scenery and simple customs of various parts of Asia; but also understand how the people who grow up here love their lives, whether they are singing in the joy of new life, or complaining in melancholy and indignation, but the attitude of seriously treating life is the same; their struggle paths experienced over hundreds of years and their ideals for the future are also the same. When people watch "The Queen of Jhansi," this magnificent epic describing the Indian national independence struggle, doesn't the patriotic enthusiasm aroused in their hearts belong to every Asian people? Are the dark things revealed in the films "Rice," "Cloud," "Rebellion," and "Where to Go," and the unfortunate encounters of lovers accused in "Chayapura," "Her Love," and "Sandi and Vina" not so familiar and so fresh in the memory of the Asian people that every audience will sigh in unison? Similarly, we admire the magnificent and exquisite Ceylon art, the brilliant face of modern Mongolia, and the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people to overcome disasters and create a happy life from the films, and we will be proud of the treasures of Asian culture and rejoice in the ever-changing posture of the Asian continent and the new life of the Asian people. As for the films "The Story of Shadow City" and "Love at First Sight," they also sing the praises of noble love, but the former takes place in a feudal kingdom seventeen hundred years ago, when people were often disturbed by wars of aggression, while the latter is happily progressing in today's Soviet country; this sharp contrast makes the audience feel gratified about the development of history. For thousands of years, the Asian people have been united in their spirit and will, and their emotions and friendship have become deeper and deeper, from the development, sowing, and harvesting of ancient culture, from the suffering of colonies and semi-colonies to the successive victories in the struggle for independence and freedom, from the yearning for a new life to the actual creation, and the Asian Film Week also vividly reflects this.
    Although each participating country in this Film Week only has one film screened, it is not difficult for us to see the unique national style and national color of each film. In terms of artistic expression, some of these films are simple and profound, some are delicate and tactful, some are bold and unrestrained, moving the heart and lungs, and some are gentle and lingering, causing people to think deeply. But they are all closely combined with ideological content, expressing the simple and vigorous temperament of the Asian people in a profound and vivid way, and have achieved true and moving artistic effects.
    It is worth mentioning in particular the great victories of the film industries of Asian countries over the past decades. Colonialists know deeply how important film, as an advanced tool for propaganda and education, is to the progress of the Asian people. Therefore, on the one hand, it dumped a large number of yellow films in Asian countries, monopolized the market, and promoted its own way of life, dispelling the national will of the vast audience; on the other hand, it ruthlessly suppressed and cracked down on the rise of the film industries founded by various countries themselves. However, the film art workers with patriotism in various countries did not lose heart and retreat in this extremely difficult situation. With the support of progressive cultural circles and the people, they continued to struggle and finally insisted on their noble cause and continued to advance it. Today, not only has the film industry founded by themselves been generally established in many Asian countries, but some countries have also made great achievements in the quantity and quality of film production, which have been warmly welcomed by the people of Asian countries and noted by the whole world. The Chinese cultural community and the Chinese people are excited about this victory of the film art of Asian countries, and it is with this excited mood that we are holding the Asian Film Week.
    Although our film industry has made great achievements since liberation, we must still work hard to learn and constantly improve the level of our films. We believe that Chinese film workers will humbly and sincerely learn from the outstanding achievements of Asian film art, learn from each other with Asian film artists, encourage each other, form close comrades-in-arms on the front line of the Asian people's film industry, and move forward hand in hand.
    I wish the Asian Film Week success! I wish the film art of Asian countries further development and prosperity! I wish the film art circles and cultural circles of Asian countries to strengthen unity, close cooperation, and make more contributions to the cultural and artistic undertakings of the people of Asian countries!

　　欢迎亚洲电影周
　　中国人民对外文化协会副会长　阳翰笙
    亚洲电影周开幕了。这是中国人民对外文化协会和中国电影工作者联谊会联合举办的一次展览性映出，包括亚洲十四个国家的影片，分两批在我国北京、天津、沈阳、长春、武汉、广州、昆明、上海、杭州、南京等十大城市举行。同时，在电影周期间有十五个国家的电影代表团，共六十余人，应邀来我国访问参观。他们有的是国家电影事业的领导者，有的是著名导演和演员，也有的是电影企业界的重要人士。他们将同我国电影工作者相互观摩，交流经验。这样，电影周不仅就其性质和规模来说是亚洲电影界的一个创举，而且对于发展亚洲各国的电影事业和彼此间的文化交流，对于促进亚洲各国人民的相互了解和友好团结，也将起着巨大的作用。中国电影工作者、中国文化界和广大观众，曾经踊跃地支持电影周的筹备工作，并将它看作是自己文化生活中的一件大事。同样，各国电影界对这次电影周的举行也给了很大的帮助。他们的热情友善的合作，为亚洲各国电影事业的共同繁荣奠定了基础。现在，让我们在欢呼电影周开幕的时候，向这些可敬的朋友们致以衷心的感谢和祝贺吧！
    亚洲电影周可以说是亚洲文化这株根深叶茂的古树上新开的一簇鲜花，是近几十年以来亚洲人民辛勤灌溉的结果。亚洲各国都有着悠久的历史文化和彼此间进行文化交流的传统，在过去几千年中，为人类文明作出了自己的贡献。亚洲人民是勤劳而智慧的，他们所创作的艺术品精美绝伦，获得全世界的赞赏。但是，自从西方殖民主义者入侵以后，亚洲各国的文化，大都遭受到横暴的压抑和摧残，各国间的文化交流因之也被破坏了。然而英勇不屈的亚洲人民是绝不愿意过着这种屈辱的生活的，他们百十年如一日地进行着争取民族独立的英勇斗争，终于捷报频传，许多国家大都先后获得了辉煌的成果。最近几年亚洲各国文化艺术的发展随之也就有如雨后春笋，各国间的文化联系也正在迅速恢复和不断加强，这些都是令人无比欢欣的新气象。
    不难理解，亚洲各国的文化的发展和各国间文化关系的增长，是亚洲人民获得真正自由幸福的重要条件之一。1955年4月，相继在新德里和万隆举行的亚洲国家会议和亚非会议，都曾对文化合作问题作出决议，鼓励各国人民和政府致力于这方面的活动。两年多以来人们可以看到这些决议是普遍受到重视的。就以中国来说，在这段时期内我们的艺术表演团体访问了十二个亚洲国家，同时更接待了来自九个亚洲国家的艺术团体。我们举办过印度和日本的电影周，接待过印度、缅甸等国的电影代表，参加过在叙利亚首都大马士革举行的国际电影节。我们热烈地支持并参加了1956年底在印度举行的亚洲作家会议。现在我们又荣幸地举办这次亚洲电影周，并欢迎各国的电影代表团来我国访问。我们相信，这些都象征着亚洲各国文化合作已进入一个新的历史时代。
    这次电影周所映出的都是各国新近摄制的优秀影片。它们在思想内容和艺术形式方面都是多彩多样的，也称得上是一次亚洲电影艺术的“百花齐放”。这些影片有的反映和平建设的幸福岁月，有的描写饥寒交迫的惨淡生涯；有的歌颂捍卫民族独立自主的斗争，有的反抗黑暗屈辱的命运。在这里，人们不但可以观览亚洲各地幽美的自然风光和淳朴的风俗习惯；而且可以体会到生长在这里的人民是怎样热爱自己的生活，他们无论是在新生的欢乐中讴歌，或者是在忧郁和愤懑中申诉，但那种严肃地对待生活的态度是一致的；他们几百年来所经历的斗争道路和对于未来的理想也是一致的。当人们观看“章西女皇”的时候，这部描述印度民族独立斗争的大气磅礴的史诗，在他们心中激起了爱国主义热情，难道不是属于每个亚洲人民所共有的吗？“米”“阴云”“叛逆”“向何处去”这些影片所揭露的阴暗的东西，“查雅布拉纳”“她的爱”“桑弟和维娜”所控诉的有情人的不幸的遭遇，对于亚洲人民不都是那么熟悉，那么记忆犹新，以致每个观众都会同声叹息吗？同样，我们从影片中欣赏着瑰丽玲珑的锡兰艺术，现代蒙古的辉煌面貌和越南人民战胜灾荒，创造幸福生活的英勇斗争，就会为亚洲文化的瑰宝而骄傲，为亚洲大地日新月异的姿态和亚洲人民的新生活而欢欣鼓舞。至于影片
  “沙道城的故事”和“一见钟情”同样歌颂了崇高的爱情，但前者发生在一千七百年前的封建王国，当时人们还常常被侵略战争所纷扰，而后者正在今天的苏维埃国家幸福地进行着；这种鲜明的对比，使观众对于历史的发展，产生了欣慰的感觉。数千年来，亚洲人民从古代文化的开拓、播种到收获，从殖民地、半殖民地的苦难到独立自由斗争的节节胜利，从对于新生活的憧憬到实际的创造，他们的精神和意志始终是团结的，他们的情感和友谊是愈来愈深厚的，亚洲电影周也鲜明地反映了这一点。
    这次电影周放映的影片虽然每个参加的国家只有一部，但我们也不难看出每部片子的独特的民族风格和民族的色彩。这些影片在艺术表现上有的朴实浑厚，有的细腻委婉，有的粗犷豪放，动人心肺，有的温静低徊，发人深思。但是它们都同思想内容紧密地结合，深刻而生动地表达着亚洲各国人民的淳朴刚健的气质，收到了真实动人的艺术效果。
    值得特别指出的是亚洲各国电影事业几十年来的巨大胜利。殖民主义者深深知道，电影作为一种宣传教育的先进工具，对于亚洲人民的进步具有多么大的意义。因此它一面在亚洲各国大量倾销黄色影片，垄断市场，并宣传自己的生活方式，消靡广大观众的民族意志；一面无情地压制和打击各国自己创办的电影事业的兴起。但是各国的具有爱国主义精神的电影艺术工作者们，在这种万分艰难的处境下并没有灰心退却，他们在进步文化界和人民的支援下再接再厉地斗争，终于将自己的崇高事业坚持下来并不断地推进。今天许多亚洲国家中不仅已普遍建立了自己创办的电影事业，而且有些国家，在影片生产的数量和质量方面，都已经取得了很大的成就，受到亚洲各国人民的热烈欢迎和全世界的注视。中国文化界和中国人民对于亚洲各国电影艺术的这一胜利感到兴奋，我们就是以这种兴奋的心情来举办亚洲电影周的。
    我国的电影事业，自从解放以来，虽然已经取得了很大的成就，但是我们还必须努力学习，不断地提高我国影片的水平。我们相信，中国的电影工作者们，将虚心诚恳地学习亚洲各国电影艺术的优秀成就，同亚洲各国电影艺术家切磋琢磨，相互勉励，结成亚洲人民电影事业战线上的亲密战友，携手前进。
    祝亚洲电影周成功！祝亚洲各国的电影艺术进一步发展、繁荣！祝亚洲各国的电影艺术界、文化界加强团结，密切合作，为亚洲各国人民的文化艺术事业作出更多的贡献！
