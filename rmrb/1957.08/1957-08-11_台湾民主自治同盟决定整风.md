Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League Decides to Rectify

(Our dispatch) The headquarters of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League issued a decision on August 10 regarding conducting rectification within the league. The decision stated: During the rectification, it is necessary to draw a clear line between ourselves and the right-wing elements politically and ideologically based on the six criteria proposed by Chairman Mao. It is necessary to examine whether the work of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League and the position of its members truly aim to take the socialist road and truly accept the leadership of the Communist Party, so as to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, distinguish right from wrong, and correct our position, in order to better contribute to the liberation of Taiwan and the construction of socialism.

The decision pointed out that during the rectification period, the organization will not be developed further. Places that were originally preparing to establish new institutions will also temporarily suspend establishment.

The decision concluded: This rectification should strive for the leadership and assistance of the Party. On the other hand, we should also continue to help the Party with its rectification.

The headquarters has established a rectification leading group, headed by Li Chunqing.
