Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 12th: In Zhejiang Province's Qing Tian County, the hometown of rightist Zhang Naiqi, over 100,000 peasants have exposed and refuted Zhang Naiqi's plot to sabotage collectivization and grain policies, more resolutely embarking on the socialist road.

Last year, Zhang Naiqi went to Qing Tian County, ostensibly for "inspection," but actually to stir up trouble everywhere, inciting peasants to oppose collectivization and the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain. When he heard some well-to-do middle peasants complaining about insufficient grain and dissatisfaction with the cooperatives, he said, "If you have any opinions, report them all to the Central Government." Soon, many well-to-do middle peasants wrote to Zhang Naiqi complaining about insufficient grain, demanding withdrawal from the agricultural cooperatives, and falsely accusing cadres. Zhao Xia Hua, a well-to-do middle peasant in Da Lu Township, who had more than 1,000 catties of surplus grain at home, also wrote to Zhang Naiqi many times, claiming she was starving. Zhang Naiqi even personally replied to Liu Jin Shan, a well-to-do middle peasant in Ju Pu Township, supporting his demand to withdraw from the cooperative. Liu Jin Shan took Zhang Naiqi's personal letter everywhere, saying, "The Central Government is allowing us to withdraw from the cooperative," leading to the withdrawal of a large number of members from five agricultural cooperatives in three nearby townships, causing the agricultural cooperatives to fall into a state of disarray. In May and June of this year, a small number of illegal landlords, rich peasants, remnant counter-revolutionaries in Qing Tian County echoed Zhang Naiqi, carrying out various rumors and sabotage activities. Many villages spread rumors such as "Zhang Naiqi speaks for the peasants and is beneficial to the peasants," "The ration of retained grain will be increased to 600 catties," and "The Communist Party will be overthrown in at most three years." The government's increase in grain supply after last year's drought was also falsely claimed to be "Minister Zhang's merit," and "Minister Zhang's visit to Qing Tian once resulted in a distribution of rice."

Since July, the Secretary and Ministers of the Qing Tian County Committee of the Communist Party of China have led a large number of cadres to the countryside to widely carry out socialist propaganda and education movements among the peasants. They helped the peasants conduct "three calculations and three comparisons": calculate the benefits of unified purchase and sale of grain and compare them with the disadvantages of free grain trading; calculate the advantages of collectivization and compare them with individual farming; calculate the improvements in living standards since liberation and compare them with those before liberation. Through these "three calculations and three comparisons," the peasants' level of understanding was greatly improved. They conducted reasoned struggles against illegal landlords, rich peasant elements, etc., exposing and refuting various reactionary speeches. Through reasoned struggle and improved awareness, 3,100 peasant households who had withdrawn from the cooperatives returned to the cooperatives, and more than 60 agricultural cooperatives were reorganized. The five agricultural cooperatives in Ju Pu and other townships, which had fallen into a state of disarray due to Liu Jin Shan's incitement using Zhang Naiqi's personal letter, are now tending to consolidate again, and most of the more than 100 members who had withdrawn from the cooperatives have returned to the cooperatives. They said: In the past, they were deceived by Zhang Naiqi, their minds were confused, but now their eyes have been opened. After the peasants who had withdrawn from the cooperative in Hai Xi Township rejoined, more than 400 people in the township newly built more than two *li* of irrigation canals in four days, ensuring that more than 700 *mu* of rice fields were not affected by drought. At present, the peasants in the whole county are enthusiastically handing in grain and selling surplus grain under the slogan of "handing in public grain early and selling more surplus grain."

    青田县农民觉悟提高眼睛擦亮
    揭露章乃器煽动农民闹退社
    新华社杭州12日电　右派分子章乃器的家乡浙江省青田县，十多万农民揭发和驳斥了章乃器破坏合作化和粮食政策的阴谋活动，更坚决地走社会主义道路。
    章乃器去年到青田县，借“视察”为名到处点火，煽动农民反对合作化和粮食统购统销政策。当他听到有些富裕中农叫粮食不够吃，对合作社不满时就说：“你们有意见，统统告到中央去”。不久就有不少富裕中农写信给章乃器，叫粮食不够，闹退出农业社，还诬告干部。大路乡富裕中农赵夏花家有余粮一千多斤，也多次写信给章乃器喊要饿死。章乃器还亲自给莒浦乡富裕中农刘金善回信，支持他闹退社。刘金善拿了章乃器的亲笔信到处说：“中央都让我们退社了”，附近三个乡有五个农业社因此退出大批社员，使农业社陷于涣散状态。今年5、6月间，青田县少数不法地主、富农、残余反革命分子和章乃器相呼应，进行了各种造谣破坏活动。许多乡村流传着“章乃器替农民说话，对农民有利”，“留口粮要增加到六百斤了”，“共产党最多三年天下了”等谣言。去年旱灾后政府增加粮食供应数量，也被造谣说成是“章部长的功劳”，“章部长来青田一次就发了一次大米”。
    7月份以来，中共青田县委书记和部长带领大批干部下乡，向农民广泛开展社会主义宣传教育运动。他们帮助农民进行三算三比：算粮食统购统销好处账，和粮食自由买卖时的坏处对比；算合作化优越性账，和单干对比；算解放后生活提高账，和解放前对比。经过三算三比，农民的认识水平大大提高，他们向不法地主、富农分子等进行了说理斗争，揭发和驳斥了各种反动言论。通过说理斗争提高觉悟，先后有三千一百户退社的农民回社，重新组织了六十多个农业社。因刘金善用章乃器亲笔信煽动而形成陷于涣散状态的莒浦等乡的五个农业社，现在又趋于巩固，退出的一百多户社员已大部分回社。他们说：过去被章乃器欺骗了，思想糊里糊涂，现在眼睛擦亮了。海溪乡退社的农民重新入社后，四天中全乡有四百多人新造了两里多长的灌水道，保证了七百多亩稻田不受旱。目前全县农民正在“早交公粮、多卖余粮”的口号下，踊跃缴粮卖粮。
