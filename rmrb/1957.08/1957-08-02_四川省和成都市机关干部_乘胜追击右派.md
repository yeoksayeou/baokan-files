    Sichuan Province and Chengdu City机关 Cadres
    Press Home the Attack on the Rightists
    (Our dispatch)机关 cadres in Sichuan Province and Chengdu City are actively engaged in the struggle against the Rightists, and Rightist elements hidden in the机关 are being exposed one after another. Li Yihen of the Provincial Public Security Department, formerly a member of the Three People's Principles Youth League, secretly destroyed two important confession materials of counter-revolutionary criminals while working in the archives room. During the blooming and contending period, he clamored for a big blooming and contending among the prisoners in labor camps, inciting them to report grievances and take revenge; and in a big-character poster titled "Fire," he wrote, "The fire is finally burning, and it is burning more and more fiercely. I added a piece of charcoal and stirred up another gust of wind." He even declared that he would make several pairs of handcuffs to handcuff the Communist Party members. Wang Jihong, the chief clerk of the Second Railway Engineering Bureau, slandered the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, believing that it had created a world of terror, making technical cadres still talk about it with fear; he also incited those who were being investigated to oppose the leadership of the Party with violent means. Hu Chuanxiang, a member of the China Democratic League in the Department of Civil Affairs, accepted instructions from Fan Puzhai in Beijing and, after returning to Chengdu, started fires everywhere, openly proposing the slogan of squeezing all Communist Party members out of the League. Liao Shiming, a renegade from the Party in the Department of Transportation, saw the Rightists attacking the Party and believed that the Party was about to collapse and a Hungarian incident was about to occur in China. In order to "preserve his life," he hastily published Party and state secrets in big-character posters, openly supporting Zhou Zijun and other bandits, who were key figures in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries' investigation. The Chengdu Railway Bureau exposed the reactionary small group "Three Also Revolutionary Group" headed by Zhang Huachun, which openly wrote in its general program and articles of association, "Opposing communism is our aim, and establishing a society without communism in China is our goal. All people who oppose communism and want to change China into a non-communist country are friends and allies of the Three Also Revolutionary Group." Now, all机关 are holding meetings day after day to press home the attack on the Rightists.

    四川省和成都市机关干部
    乘胜追击右派
    本报讯　四川省和成都市的机关干部积极投入反右派斗争，隐蔽在机关中的右派分子纷纷被揭露出来。省公安厅李一痕，原是三青团员，在档案室工作时，他暗中销毁两份反革命罪犯重要口供材料；鸣放中，他大嚷要在劳改犯中大鸣大放，煽动劳改犯有冤报冤，有仇报仇；并在一篇题名“火”的大字报上写道“火终于烧起来了，越烧越猛，我添进一颗炭，又扬起一阵风”。他还声言要打几副铐子把共产党员铐起来。铁路第二工程局主任干事王季洪污蔑肃反运动，他认为肃反造成恐怖世界，使技术干部至今还谈虎色变，他并煽动被审查的人起来用暴风骤雨手段反对党的领导。民政厅盟员胡传祥在北京接受范朴斋指使，返蓉后，到处点火，公开提出把所有共产党员们挤出盟的口号。交通厅叛党分子廖世明看到右派分子向党进攻，即认为党要垮台，中国要发生匈牙利事件，为“保全生命”，他连忙在大字报上公布党和国家机密，公开支持肃反审查重点周子骏等匪案。成都铁路局揭露以张化纯为首的反动小集团“三也革命小组”，在总纲章程中公然写道“反对共产主义是我们的宗旨，在中国建立一个没有共产主义的社会是我们的目的，凡反对共产主义要变中国为非共产主义的人士均为三也革命小组之友人盟军”。现在各机关连日召开会议乘胜追击右派。
