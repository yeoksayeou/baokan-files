Xinhua News Agency, August 25th, Bangkok dispatch: The Thai cabinet held a meeting yesterday related to the issue of Defense Minister Nai Sarit and others resigning from their cabinet positions.

No statement was issued after the meeting. According to Reuters, Thai Prime Minister Luang Phibunsongkhram told the press after the meeting that he had informed the cabinet about the resignations of the five ministers, but the cabinet did not discuss these resignations, nor did it make any decisions on new appointments.

In addition to Nai Sarit, the other four cabinet members who have recently resigned are: Deputy Minister of Defense Nai Thanon, Deputy Minister of Interior Nai Praphat, Minister of Cooperatives Nai Si Li, and Deputy Minister of Agriculture General Charoonkiat Wattanakul. They are all military generals. Nai Sarit once stated that one of the reasons for his resignation was that he disagreed with the policies implemented by the government.

Nai Khlai, Secretary-General of the Thai Socialist United Front, when speaking to the press on August 21st about the current political situation in Thailand, expressed his hope that all government officials would be vigilant and guard against imperialist interference. He said that the United Front would never intervene in the vortex of this political dispute. The United Front does not support any individual, only a government that adopts a neutral policy and withdraws from the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

Nai Khlai believes that the only way out for the Thai government is to adopt a peaceful and neutral policy in accordance with public opinion and withdraw from the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

　　泰政府五个阁员辞职
  　乃克莱说要提防帝国主义干涉
    新华社25日讯　曼谷消息：泰国内阁昨天举行会议，这次会议与国防部长乃沙立等人辞去内阁职务的问题有关。
    会后没有发表声明。据路透社报道，泰国总理銮披汶在会后对报界说，他已经把五个阁员辞职的事情告诉了内阁，但是，内阁没有讨论这些辞职问题，也没有对新任人选作出决定。
    除了乃沙立以外，其他最近相继辞职的四名内阁阁员是：国防部副部长乃他侬，内政部副部长乃巴博，合作事务部长乃是立，农业部副部长乍伦基埃·瓦坦库。他们都是军事将领。乃沙立曾经表示，他的辞职原因之一是，他不同意政府所执行的政策。
    泰国社会主义联合阵线总书记乃克莱8月21日就泰国当前政局向报界发表谈话时，表示希望各政府要员提高警惕，提防帝国主义的从中干涉。他说，联合阵线绝不介入这次政局纠纷的漩涡，联合阵线不拥护任何个人，只拥护采取中立政策和退出东南亚条约组织的政府。
    乃克莱认为，泰国政府的唯一出路是：按照民意采取和平中立政策，退出东南亚条约组织。
