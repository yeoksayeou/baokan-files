　　Soumagahara Incident

　　The Soumagahara Incident is one of countless atrocities committed by the US military against Japanese residents. It ignited a massive struggle by the Japanese people against American enslavement and for national independence.

　　The incident occurred at the US military's Soumagahara training ground in Gunma Prefecture, Japan. On January 30th of this year, the 8th Regiment of the US First Cavalry Division was conducting shooting exercises here. After the exercises ended, some farmers who had been deprived of their land usually came to the field to collect spent cartridges to sell to scrap metal dealers to make a living. At this time, a US Private First Class named Girard deliberately used empty cartridges to lure a farmer closer, then suddenly fired two shots, killing a Japanese farm woman named Sakai Naka. She was forty-six years old and the mother of six children.

　　After this incident occurred, the US military authorities repeatedly prevaricated: first saying it was an accidental hit, then saying that Girard had killed someone while on duty, attempting to exonerate the perpetrator. This is because, according to the unequal US-Japan "Administrative Agreement," Japan has no jurisdiction over the death of a person killed by a US soldier stationed in Japan while performing official duties.

　　This arrogant attitude of the US side aroused the anger of the broad masses of the Japanese people. On February 4th, the Japan Socialist Party sent people to the Soumagahara training ground to conduct an on-site investigation, determining that the US military had intentionally killed someone outside of official duties. Then, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party also conducted an on-site investigation. On February 9th, the Gunma Prefectural Police Headquarters charged Girard with "injury resulting in death" to the Maebashi District Public Prosecutor's Office in Gunma Prefecture. Later, the Japanese Supreme Public Prosecutor's Office also confirmed the American soldier's crime, requesting the US military authorities stationed in Japan to extradite the perpetrator to Japanese courts for trial. On February 20th, the National Conference Against Military Bases in Japan held a national rally in Tokyo to protest the killing of a Japanese woman by a US soldier. The conference unanimously resolved to lodge a serious protest with the United States and demand that the murderer be handed over to Japan for trial.

　　Under the unanimous demands of the broad masses of the Japanese people, the US-Japan Joint Committee, established under the US-Japan "Administrative Agreement," made a decision on May 16th to hand over the perpetrator to Japan for trial. However, a day later, US Secretary of Defense Wilson suddenly ordered the US military authorities in the Far East not to hand over Girard to the Japanese government. This news further aroused strong opposition from various Japanese people's organizations and political parties. On May 28th, representatives of the Japan Socialist Party, the Communist Party, labor unions, and farmers' groups held a joint meeting in Soumagahara, deciding to jointly launch an anti-American protest movement. The Japan Socialist Party and the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan and other groups also sent representatives to the US Embassy to lodge protests. Under this situation, US Secretary of State Dulles and Secretary of Defense Wilson were forced to issue a joint statement on June 4th, agreeing to hand Girard over to the Japanese side for trial. However, the US Federal Court publicly intervened on June 6th and June 18th, deciding not to hand over the perpetrator to Japan for trial. This fickle attitude of the US authorities made the Japanese people even more indignant. On June 21st, hundreds of college students in Tokyo held an anti-American demonstration in front of the US Embassy. On July 8th, the "Soumagahara Incident Countermeasures Council," composed of various groups in Gunma Prefecture, sent representatives to the US Embassy to deliver a petition signed by 45,000 people, demanding that the United States hand over Girard. Due to the strong pressure from the Japanese people, the US government was forced to instruct the US Supreme Court to announce a change in the Federal Court's decision on July 11th, handing over the murderer to Japan for trial.

### 相马原事件

　　相马原事件
    相马原事件是美军残杀日本居民的无数暴行之一。它激起了日本人民反对美国奴役、争取民族独立的一次巨大斗争。
    事件发生在日本群马县的美军相马原演习场。今年1月30日，美军第一骑兵师第八团在这里举行了射击演习。演习停止后，通常有一些被夺去土地的农民到场上来拾取弹壳，卖给废铁商，借以糊口。这时，一个美国三等兵哲腊德故意以空弹壳引诱农民走近跟前，然后突然连发二枪，打死了一个日本农妇坂井中。她今年四十六岁，是六个孩子的母亲。
    这一事件发生以后，美军当局曾经一再狡赖：开始说这是无意击中，后来又说哲腊德是在值勤的时候伤人致死的，企图以此为凶犯开脱罪行。因为根据不平等的美日“行政协定”规定，驻日美军在执行公务情况下杀人致死，日本是没有裁判权的。
    美方这种横蛮态度，引起了广大日本人民的愤怒。2月4日，日本社会党派人到相马原演习场进行现场调查，确定美军是在执行公务之外故意杀人，接着执政的自由民主党也在现场进行了调查。2月9日，日本群马县警察本部向群马县的前桥地方检察厅控告哲腊德“伤人致死”，后来日本最高检察厅也确定了美兵的罪行，要求驻日美军当局引渡凶犯到日本法院审讯。2月20日，日本全国反对军事基地会议在东京举行了抗议美国兵枪杀日本妇女国民大会，大会一致决议向美国提出严重抗议，要求把杀人犯交给日本审判。
    在日本广大人民的一致要求下，根据美日“行政协定”设立的日美联合委员会在5月16日作出决定，要把凶犯交给日本审讯。但是，过了一天，美国国防部长威尔逊又突然命令远东美军当局不许把哲腊德交给日本政府。这个消息更加引起日本各人民团体和政党的强烈反对。5月28日，日本社会党、共产党、工会和农民团体的代表在相马原举行联席会议，决定共同展开一个反美抗议运动。日本社会党和日本工会总评议会等团体还派遣代表到美国大使馆提出了抗议。处在这种形势之下，美国国务卿杜勒斯和国防部长威尔逊才被迫在6月4日发表联合声明，同意把哲腊德移交日方审判。但是，美国联邦法院在6月6日和6月18日又公开出面干涉，决定不把凶犯交给日本审讯。美国当局这种反复无常的态度，使日本人民更加怒不可抑。6月21日，东京的几百名大学生在美国大使馆前面举行了反美示威。7月8日，群马县各团体组成的“相马原事件对策协议会”又派代表向美国大使馆递交了一份有四万五千人签名的请愿书，要求美国把哲腊德交出来。由于日本人民的强大压力，美国政府才被迫授意美国最高法院在7月11日宣布改变联邦法院的决定，把杀人凶犯交给日本审判。
