Xinhua News Agency, August 21st: The anti-Rightist struggle in the capital's legal circles has achieved great victories, exposing a group of Rightist elements and a reactionary Rightist group headed by Qian Duansheng.

The anti-Rightist struggle in the capital's legal circles was carried out through a combination of legal circle symposiums and cooperation between various political and legal departments and political and legal colleges. The legal circle symposium has been held 32 times from May 27th to today. In the first six symposiums, during the period of Great Democracy, the Rightist elements in the legal circles took the opportunity to help the Communist Party rectify its work and launched a massive attack on the Communist Party and the government's judicial work. On June 11th, the capital's legal circle symposium launched an anti-Rightist struggle, and Rightist elements in the legal circles were constantly exposed. At the legal circle symposium on the 20th of this month, the reactionary words and deeds of the Rightist element Yu Zhongluo, advisor to the Supreme People's Court, were exposed and criticized. Yu Zhongluo consistently hated socialism and the proletarian dictatorship. He slandered the people's government for "emphasizing dictatorship too much in the past and not paying attention to handling contradictions among the people." He even maliciously believed that "the current government's protection of citizens' rights is not as good as that of feudal dynasties and Chiang Kai-shek." He "opposed" the people's government's implementation of dictatorship over habitual thieves and other bad elements. He also slandered that "the line between guilt and innocence is not clearly defined" in judicial work, and that "innocent people are wrongly convicted." He purposefully believed that there were three reasons for this "bad phenomenon": "no laws to follow," "laws are not followed," and "judges can make judgments at will." Yu Zhongluo said that the current judicial cadres have "extremely low" levels, "wavering in grasping policies," and "always correcting to the left when they are too right, and correcting to the right when they are too left." He very much agreed with the reactionary remarks of the Rightist element Yang Yuqing that the Communist Party should "step down from the stage and get out of the sedan chair," and believed that a "change of shift" should be made. Yu Zhongluo was the head of the Minmeng (Democratic League) branch of the Supreme People's Court. During the period of Great Democracy, he actively tried to bring some people who were dissatisfied with their work into the Minmeng and often incited young people to attack the Party.

Among the Rightist elements exposed at the legal circle symposium were Wu Chuan'yi, deputy head of the Financial and Trade Regulations Group of the Legislative Affairs Bureau, Lou Bangyan, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Justice, and Chen Jianguo, a cadre of the Research Office of the Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court. These Rightist elements all distorted and fabricated so-called "materials" from actual work to slander judicial work. Wu Chuan'yi, a believer and propagator of Chen Guofu's vitalism, clamored that "it is difficult to follow the law," attempting to negate the people's democratic legal system. Chen Jianguo clamored that "the lack of laws to follow is one of the reasons for wrong cases," attempting to negate the achievements of legislative work since liberation.

Among the Rightist elements exposed at the symposium were also professors and lecturers from political and legal colleges, such as Qian Duansheng, president of Beijing University of Political Science and Law, Wang Tieya, professor of Peking University, Wu Wenhan, associate professor of Lanzhou University who is currently studying at Renmin University of China, Wu Zonglin, lecturer at Renmin University of China, and Xie Huaishi, teacher at the Central School of Political Science and Law Cadres. Some of them attempted to negate the great achievements of the judicial reform movement and the positive role of the adjustment of political and legal departments, believing that in these works, "old legal personnel were beaten to death with one stick," and proposed to "recall their souls." Some slandered the political and legal education cause, saying that "the main problem in the current political and legal circles is sectarianism," and some Rightist elements also viciously said: "Renmin University of China is the base of dogmatism, the Central School of Political Science and Law Cadres is the old hen of sectarianism, and the Law Department of Peking University is the派出所 (local police station) of dogmatism and sectarianism." Some Rightist professors exposed their ambitions during the Great Democracy. Wang Tieya, a professor at Peking University, wanted to use the International Relations History Teaching and Research Section of the History Department of Peking University as a basis to merge the relevant departments of the Foreign Affairs College, Renmin University of China, and the Institute of International Relations of the Academy of Sciences into Peking University to form a "large Department of International Relations," with himself as the head of the department, without the leadership of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Legal figures said when exposing Wang Tieya's conspiracy plan that Wang Tieya's conspiracy plan was to usurp the Party's leadership in political and legal education. Wang Tieya also publicly proposed abolishing the school Party committee system.

The reactionary Rightist group in the legal circles headed by Qian Duansheng has recently been exposed by legal figures. Members of this group include Rightist elements such as Lou Bangyan and Wang Tieya. They jointly conspired to "re-adjust departments" and organize a "large law school" in an attempt to seize leadership of the political and legal colleges, and then seize leadership of the political and legal departments. Their reactionary group was carrying out conspiratorial activities under the planning of the Zhang-Luo alliance. Under everyone's exposure, Qian Duansheng has admitted that he "accepted the leadership of Zhang and Luo and embarked on the road of opposing the Party and socialism."

The history of many Rightist elements in the legal circles is ugly and dirty. Some have been Kuomintang agents, some have relations with American agents, some are anti-Communist experts, and some are Kuomintang corrupt officials. Yang Yuqing, the Rightist element who openly clamored for the Communist Party to "step down" and "get out of the sedan chair," is a veteran anti-Communist expert. During the Kuomintang rule, Yang Yuqing successively served as a member of the Kuomintang Central Committee, a central executive member of the Sanqing Tuan (Three Principles of the People Youth League), a bogus legislator, and a bogus political vice minister of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, and was a backbone member of the reactionary party and group. In 1943, he gave a reactionary sermon of "attacking the mind" to hundreds of Communists and patriots on the podium of the Kuomintang reactionary concentration camp in Chongqing, and he also conducted a "close combat heart-digging struggle" with Communists and patriots. Qian Duansheng, Lou Bangyan, and Wang Tieya in the Rightist reactionary group in the legal circles all had close relations with American agents in the past. The Rightist element Yu Zhongluo is a capitalist with more than 300 taels of gold and 10,000 yuan of stock. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, he specialized in defending traitors.

The capital's legal circles will continue to hold symposiums and will work closely with various political and legal departments and political and legal colleges to further deepen the anti-Rightist struggle in order to achieve a complete victory.

    首都法学界披荆斩棘搜索右派
    以钱端升为首的小集团和一些右派分子躲藏不住了
    新华社21日讯　首都法学界的反右派斗争已取得很大的胜利，揭露出一批右派分子和一个以钱端升为首的右派反动集团。
    首都法学界的反右派斗争是法学界座谈会和各政法部门、政法院校互相配合进行的。法学界座谈会从5月27日开始到今天止已开了三十二次会议。在前六次座谈会上，即大鸣大放时期，法学界的右派分子利用帮助共产党整风的机会，向共产党和政府司法工作大肆进攻。到6月11日，首都法学界座谈会即展开了反右派的斗争，法学界中的右派分子就不断地被揭露出来。在法学界本月20日的座谈会上，揭露和批判了右派分子、最高人民法院顾问俞锺骆的反动言行。俞锺骆一贯仇视社会主义和无产阶级专政。他诬蔑人民政府“过去太强调专政，不重视处理人民内部矛盾”。他甚至恶意地认为“现在的政府不保护公民权利的状况”，还“不如封建王朝和蒋介石”。他对人民政府对惯盗、惯窃等坏分子实行专政“表示反对”。他还诬蔑在审判工作上“罪与非罪的界限划不清”，“出入人罪”。他别有用心地认为产生这种“坏现象”的原因有三点：“无法可依”，“有法不依”和“审判人员判案可以随心所欲”。俞锺骆说现在的司法干部水平“极低”，在“政策掌握上左右摇摆不定”，在“量刑上总是纠左偏右，纠右偏左”。他很赞同右派分子杨玉清要共产党
  “下台下轿”的反动言论，认为应该“换班”。俞锺骆是民盟最高人民法院支部的负责人。在大鸣大放期间，他积极活动，企图拉一些对工作不满的人加入民盟，并常煽动青年人向党进攻。
    在法学界座谈会上揭发的右派分子中还有法制局财贸法规组副组长吴传颐、北京市司法局副局长楼邦彦和北京市高级人民法院研究室干部陈建国等。这些右派分子都歪曲、捏造所谓实际工作中的“材料”，污蔑司法工作。陈果夫唯生主义的信徒和传播者吴传颐叫嚣“有法难依”，企图否定人民民主法制。陈建国叫嚣“无法可依，是造成错案的原因之一”，企图否定解放以后的立法工作的成绩。
    在座谈会上揭发的右派分子中还有政法院校的教授、讲师，如北京政法学院院长钱端升、北京大学教授王铁崖、现在中国人民大学进修的兰州大学副教授吴文翰、中国人民大学讲师吴宗麟、中央政法干校教员谢怀栻等。他们中有的企图否定司法改革运动的伟大成绩和政法院系调整的积极作用，他们认为在这些工作中，“旧法学人员被一棍子打死”，提出要“招魂”。有的污蔑政法教育事业，说“目前政法界的主要问题是宗派主义”，有些右派分子还恶毒地说：“中国人民大学是教条主义的大本营，中央政法干校是宗派主义的老母鸡，北大法律系是教条主义、宗派主义的派出所。”有些右派教授在大鸣大放中暴露了他们的野心。北京大学教授王铁崖想以北京大学历史系国际关系史教研室为基础，把外交学院、中国人民大学及科学院国际关系研究所等有关部门，都合并到北京大学，成立一个“大国际关系系”，由他自己做系主任，不要外交部领导。法学界人士在揭露王铁崖的阴谋计划时说，王铁崖的阴谋计划就是想篡夺党在政法教育方面的领导权。王铁崖也曾公开提出取消学校党委制的主张。
    法学界中以钱端升为首的右派反动集团在最近已被法学界人士揭露出来了。这个集团的成员有楼邦彦、王铁崖等右派分子。他们共同阴谋策划“院系再调整”，组织“大法学院”，企图夺取政法学院领导权，从而再夺取政法部门领导权。他们这个反动集团是在章罗联盟策划之下进行阴谋活动的。钱端升在大家的揭发下，已承认他是“接受了章罗的领导，走上了反党反社会主义的道路”。
    法学界中的许多右派分子的历史是丑恶和肮脏的。有的做过国民党的特务，有的与美国特务有关系、有的是反共能手，有的是国民党的贪官污吏。曾公开叫嚣要共产党“下台”、“下轿”的右派分子杨玉清就是一个老牌的反共专家。杨玉清在国民党统治时期，先后担任国民党中央委员、三青团中央干事、伪立法委员和伪司法行政部政务次长等重要职务，是反动党团的骨干分子。1943年，他在重庆国民党反动派集中营的讲台上，对着几百名共产党人和爱国人士进行了“攻心斗争”的反动说教，他还同共产党人和爱国人士进行过“短兵相接的挖心斗争”。法学界右派反动集团中的钱端升、楼邦彦、王铁崖，过去都和美国特务有密切的关系。右派分子俞锺骆是拥有三百多两黄金和万元股票的资本家。在抗战胜利后，他专门为汉奸作辩护律师。
    首都法学界还要继续召开座谈会，并将和各政法部门、各政法院校密切配合，进一步深入开展反右派的斗争，以取得彻底的胜利。
