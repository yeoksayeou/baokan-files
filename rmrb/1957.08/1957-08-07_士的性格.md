Some intellectuals, in their speeches helping the Party with the rectification campaign, often mentioned "A scholar serves one who knows him," and "A scholar dies for one who appreciates him." One university professor even said: "My feelings with the Party have been hurt, how can I continue to walk the socialist road together?" This cannot help but make me think about the character of the scholar.

Who is a scholar? A scholar is what was formerly called "scholar, peasant, artisan, merchant," the "scholar." Today, it refers to those intellectuals, especially senior intellectuals (such as university professors...).

The scholar always has a sense of superiority. In their view, because they are "book readers" who have read more books, "all other professions are base, only reading is noble," they should rightfully be ranked first according to the order of "scholar, peasant, artisan, merchant"; because they are mental laborers – intellectual laborers – they should, of course, according to the "principle" of "those who labor with their minds govern others, those who labor with their strength are governed by others," make themselves rulers and leaders, instead of being subjected to being ruled and led.

The scholar always values feelings and self-esteem. If you understand him, respect him, and have good feelings with him, becoming "appreciators" of each other, then he will be willing to devote all his strength, even "going through fire and water without hesitation." This is what they often say: "The most valuable thing in people's acquaintance is understanding each other's hearts," "To have a confidant is to die without regret," "A scholar serves one who knows him," and "A scholar dies for one who appreciates him." If you do not understand him, do not respect him (or he himself has this feeling), he will have a feeling of "talent not being met with opportunity, ability not being displayed"; he will be determined to "not govern in a position one does not hold," and even if he clearly sees problems, he will "know but not speak, speak but not fully"; or he will feel that he "has the position but not the power," and "his voice is weak," and even if he is in a position, he will not govern; or even always feel "incompatible" with the leaders – "a special feeling in my heart," "stay if compatible, leave if incompatible," and in the end, simply "leave with a flick of the sleeves."

Is this sense of superiority of intellectuals good? It is certainly good that intellectuals have some knowledge, because revolution and construction cannot be separated from knowledge. But if one exaggerates one's own knowledge too much, thinking that only intellectuals are "knowledgeable," and the Party and the workers and peasants are "ignorant," thus producing a sense of superiority, raising one's tail to the sky, and looking down on everything, then this is not good, because this sense of superiority is nothing but a wall that prevents intellectuals from integrating with the Party and the workers and peasants.

Is it good for intellectuals to be rich in emotions and self-esteem? Emotions and self-esteem are something that everyone has, and something that everyone should have. The question lies in how to understand these emotions and self-esteem, and in what kind of emotions and self-esteem one has. If one only looks at whether you understand me, respect me, and have good feelings for me, using this as a standard for whether I am worth devoting strength and selflessness and sacrifice, without focusing on for whom (a minority or the majority? Revolution or counter-revolution?) one is devoting strength and for whom one is sacrificing, then such emotions and self-esteem are "not worth learning from." In fact, the three major enemies of the past and today's right-wing ambitious elements are precisely using these emotions of intellectuals to drag them into the water. Today, in the struggle against the right-wing, some intellectuals, due to private emotional relationships, are unwilling to boldly expose the conspiratorial activities of right-wing ambitious elements, and some are obsessed with certain deviations in ideological remolding, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and other movements, even to the point where a certain professor said: My feelings with the Party have been "hurt," and I "cannot continue to walk the socialist road together," then that is even more unacceptable. If you don't take the socialist road, what kind of road do you take? Whether you like it or not, wouldn't you only be able to walk on the same road as the Zhang-Luo anti-Party alliance?

Today in our country, intellectuals and the broad masses of working people are building socialism together under the leadership of the Communist Party. Party and organizational leaders should indeed understand and respect intellectuals well, and pay attention to giving play to their enthusiasm, so that they can "make the best use of their talents." Certain Party organizations and a small number of leaders do have some shortcomings in this regard due to sectarian emotions. Today's Party rectification movement is precisely to resolutely overcome these shortcomings. But on the other hand, intellectuals themselves should also conscientiously remold their thinking, promote proletarian ideology, eliminate bourgeois ideology, transform "superiority" into "a sense of responsibility," and transform "private feelings" into "working enthusiasm." Building socialism is the collective cause of the entire people, and the work of each of us is to serve the people and serve socialist construction, not to serve a certain leader. Therefore, let's broaden our horizons to the broad masses of people and socialist construction. In fact, as long as one pays attention to ideological remolding and sincerely helps the Party with the rectification campaign, one will naturally feel that the Party and the leaders are one's confidants.

    士的性格
    凡兵
    有些知识分子，在帮助党整风的发言中，经常提到“士为知己者用”、“士为知己者死”。有一位大学教授还说：“和党已经伤了感情，怎么还能够一起走社会主义的路呢？”这，不由得使我想到士的性格问题。
    士是什么样的人？士就是过去所说的“士农工商”的“士”、“读书人”。在今天，就是指的那些知识分子，特别是高级知识分子（如大学教授……）。
    士，总是有优越感的。在他们看来，因为自己是多读了几本书的“读书人”，“万般皆下品，惟有读书高”，理应按照“士农工商”的顺序排在第一位；因为自己是劳心者——智力劳动者，当然也就理应根据“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的“原则”使自己成为统治者、领导者，而不是屈居为被统治者、被领导者。
    士，总是很讲求感情和自尊心的。如果你了解他，尊重他，和他感情好，彼此成为“知己者”，那他就肯为你付出全部力量，甚至“赴汤蹈火，在所不惜”。这就是他们所经常说的：“人之相知，贵相知心”、“得一知己，死无可恨”、“士为知己者用”、“士为知己者死”。如果你不了解他，对他不尊重（或他自己有这种感觉），他就会有“怀才不遇，能不得展”之感；就要下定“不在其位，不谋其政”之心，明明看出问题，也“知而不言，言而不尽”，或者感到自己“有职无权”、“人微言轻”，明明在位，也不谋其政；甚至总是感到和领导人“格格不入”——“别有一番滋味在心头”，“合则留，不合则去”，末了，干脆来个“拂袖而去”。
    知识分子的这种优越感好不好呢？知识分子有一定的知识，当然是好的，因为革命和建设都不能离开知识。但如果过分夸大了自己的知识，认为只有知识分子才是“有知”，党和工农群众都是“无知”，因而产生了一种优越感，把尾巴翘到天上去，目空一切，这就不好了，因为这种优越感不是别的，正是阻碍知识分子同党与工农劳动者打成一片的一道墙而已。
    知识分子富于感情和自尊心，好不好呢？感情和自尊心，人人有之，也是人人应当有的。问题是在于如何了解这种感情和自尊心，在于有什么样的感情和自尊心。如果只是看你是否了解我、尊重我和对我感情好不好，以此作为自己是否值得付出力量和忘我、牺牲的标准，而不着重看是为谁（少数人还是大多数人？革命还是反革命？）付出力量和为谁牺牲，那么，这样的感情和自尊心就“不足为训”了。事实上，过去的三大敌人，今天的右派野心分子也正是利用了知识分子的这种感情拉他们下水的。今天，在反右派的斗争中，有些知识分子，由于私人感情关系，不肯大胆揭露右派野心分子的阴谋活动，有的对思想改造、肃反等运动的某些偏差念念不忘，甚至如某教授说：和党已经“伤了感情”，“不能再和党一起走社会主义的路”，那就更要不得了。不走社会主义的道路，又走什么样的道路呢？不管你愿意与否，那还不只能是和章罗反动联盟走在一条道路上吗？
    今天在我国，知识分子同广大劳动人民，在共产党领导下，一道来建设社会主义。党和组织上的领导人，确应好好了解和尊重知识分子，注意发挥他们的积极性，使他们“人尽其才，才尽其用”。党的个别组织和少数领导人，由于有着宗派主义情绪，在这方面确存在着一些缺点。今天党的整风运动，也正是要坚决克服这一方面的缺点。但另一方面，知识分子自己，确也应当好好地改造思想，兴无产阶级的思想，灭资产阶级的思想，变“优越感”为“责任感”，变“私人感情”为“工作热情”。建设社会主义是全国人民的集体事业，我们每一个人的工作，都是为人民服务，为社会主义建设服务，而不是为某个领导者服务。因此，还是把眼光放大到广大人民和社会主义建设上去吧。事实上，只要
  自己好好注意思想改造，并诚心诚意地帮助党来整风，自然也就会感到党和领导者是知己了。
