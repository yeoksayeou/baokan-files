    Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 27th: The Shandong Provincial Library, Jinan Municipal Library, and cultural centers in various districts of Jinan are actively organizing and guiding self-study for middle and primary school graduates in Jinan who did not continue their education this year.
    Currently, 530 students have registered as readers at these units. They voluntarily form self-study groups to conduct reading or study in an organized manner. These units have compiled some book lists and plans suitable for their needs. The Shandong Provincial Library is also preparing to hire teachers of various subjects from junior high and higher primary schools to compile a one-year "Self-Study Outline" based on the students' self-study subjects to help them with their self-study.

　　组织未升学的毕业生自学
    据新华社济南27日电　山东省图书馆、济南市图书馆和济南市各区文化馆，积极组织和辅导济南市今年未升学的中、小学毕业生自学。
    目前，到这些单位办理读者登记的学生已有五百三十人，他们自愿结成自学小组，有组织地进行阅览或学习。这些单位已经编制了一些适合他们需要的图书计划和书目。山东省图书馆还准备聘请初中、高小各科教师，根据学生自学科目分别编辑一年的“自学提纲”，帮助学生们自学。
