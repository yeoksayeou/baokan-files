Xinhua News Agency, August 30th: The Mexican National Modern Ballet Troupe, invited to visit China, held its opening performance at the Tianqiao Theater in Beijing tonight. The ballet troupe's program, full of strong life, was warmly welcomed by more than a thousand spectators.

Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and Shen Yanbing, Minister of Culture, watched tonight's performance and met with the leaders and some of the performers of the Mexican National Modern Ballet Troupe during the intermission.

At the opening ceremony, Zhao Yimin, Vice President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and Guillermina Bravo, head of the Mexican National Modern Ballet Troupe, gave speeches. Zhao Yimin said that the Mexican National Modern Ballet absorbs the essence of European ballet but has a strong national flavor. The ballet troupe's performances in South America and at the Sixth World Youth and Student Peace and Friendship Festival were very successful. He believes that the ballet troupe's performances in China will also be welcomed by the Chinese people.

Mexican National Modern Ballet is different from European ballet. The actors mostly wear Mexican national costumes and go barefoot when performing. Tonight they performed five programs: "The Birthday of a Little Goddess," "Coolie," "Three Mexican Toys," "Traitor," and "Land."

The ballet troupe will also perform five more times in Beijing. (Photos attached)

　　墨西哥民族现代芭蕾舞团昨在京举行开幕式演出
    新华社30日讯  应邀来中国访问的墨西哥民族现代芭蕾舞团，今晚在北京天桥剧场举行开幕式演出。芭蕾舞团表演的富有浓厚生活气息的节目，受到了一千多名观众的热烈欢迎。
    中国文学艺术界联合会主席郭沫若、文化部部长沈雁冰观看了今晚的演出，并且在演出休息时接见了墨西哥民族现代芭蕾舞团的领导人和部分演员。
    在开幕式上，中国人民对外文化协会副会长赵毅敏和墨西哥民族现代芭蕾舞团团长吉叶尔米娜·帕拉伏讲了话。赵毅敏说，墨西哥民族现代芭蕾舞吸收了欧洲芭蕾舞的精华，但带有浓厚的民族色采。芭蕾舞团在南美洲和第六届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节上的演出，都获得很大成功。他相信芭蕾舞团在中国的演出，也将受到中国人民的欢迎。
    墨西哥民族现代芭蕾舞不同于欧洲的芭蕾舞，演员们在演出时大多穿着墨西哥的民族服装和光着脚。他们今晚共演出了“小神女的生日”、“苦力”、“三件墨西哥的玩具”、“叛徒”和“土地”五个节目。
    芭蕾舞团还将在北京演出五次。（附图片）
