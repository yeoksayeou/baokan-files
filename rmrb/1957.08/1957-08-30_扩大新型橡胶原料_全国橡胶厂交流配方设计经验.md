Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 28th. The first National Rubber Industry Formula Design Experience Exchange Conference concluded in Tianjin today. The conference pointed out that the future work direction of formula design is: to further expand new types of rubber raw materials to save natural rubber, expand the application range of synthetic rubber, increase the rational usage of carbon black that can be mass-produced in China, and relatively reduce the usage of zinc oxide and other materials.

Rubber formula design is an important part of rubber industry technology, and is a major link in improving the quality of rubber products and reducing costs. Since liberation, the level of rubber formula design work in our country has greatly improved. At this meeting, forty-three items of experience related to formula design from various rubber factories and rubber industry research institutes across the country were exchanged.

During the conference, Soviet expert Maleshev gave a special report on "The Principles of Modern Rubber Formula Design" and answered specific technical questions raised by the representatives.

This conference was convened by the Rubber Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Chemical Industry.

　　扩大新型橡胶原料
　　全国橡胶厂交流配方设计经验
    据新华社天津28日电　第一次全国橡胶工业配方设计经验交流会议今天在天津闭幕。会议指出了今后配方设计的工作方向是：进一步扩大新型橡胶原材料以节约天然橡胶，扩大合成橡胶的应用范围，增加我国能大量生产的炭黑的合理使用量，相对地减少氧化锌等的用量。
    橡胶配方设计是橡胶工业技术的重要组成部分，是提高橡胶制品质量，降低成本的主要环节。解放以来，我国橡胶配方设计工作水平有了很大的提高。在这次会上交流的全国各橡胶厂和橡胶工业研究所有关配方设计的经验，共有四十三项。
    会议期间，苏联专家马莱舍夫就“现代橡胶配方设计的原则”作了专门性的报告，并解答了代表们提出的具体技术问题。
    这次会议是化学工业部橡胶工业管理局召开的。
