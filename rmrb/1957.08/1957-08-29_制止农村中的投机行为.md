　　Curbing Speculative Activities in Rural Areas
    Currently, in rural Xiangyin County, Hunan Province, some speculators are engaging in speculative buying and selling under the guise of seeking sideline occupations and self-reliance through production. Some even illegally use rice to brew wine, others traffic in cotton cloth, others traffic in timber, and others slaughter pigs indiscriminately. For example, speculators in the Quanmin and other agricultural cooperatives in Huangjia Township, Xiangyin, have caused a severe grain shortage due to using rice to brew wine. In Dongtang and Miluo Townships, there are no fewer than one hundred cotton cloth speculators. In Shangnan and Baishui cooperatives in Dongtang Township alone, there are more than fifty cloth vendors, who have sold a total of about one thousand bolts of cotton cloth. The raw materials for weaving, in addition to a portion that they purchased from cooperative departments, are mostly old cotton wadding from the homes of agricultural cooperative members. According to incomplete statistics from the above two cooperatives, a total of more than one hundred and seventy quilts and more than three hundred and sixty cotton garments have been destroyed. Feng Zhengkun, Feng Zhulou, Wang Yilin, and others, in order to pursue exorbitant profits, do not hesitate to demolish cooperative members' houses and ancestral halls to traffic in timber. Cao Zhisong of Shangnan cooperative and others purchase large quantities of live pigs for slaughter, evading national taxes.

    These speculators all use various illegal means to evade taxes, buy up and抢购 goods, and deceive farmers. Some use money to套购 grain from cooperative members and engage in usury. For example, the speculator Feng Zhulou套购 more than six hundred catties of grain from seven cooperative member households, including Feng Shuqing and Feng Shengchu, in Baishui cooperative. Feng Ping'an lent money to cooperative members at a high interest rate of four 角 per yuan per month.

    These speculators also collude to undermine agricultural cooperatives. For example, Feng Zhengkun, because he only engaged in speculative buying and selling and did not engage in labor, was unable to receive his rations in the early and mid-rice pre-distribution. He then organized small cliques to闹退社 [make trouble to withdraw from the cooperative] and obstruct the transplanting of late rice in the cooperative. All this has seriously affected social order and the consolidation of cooperation. Therefore, I request the government to take effective measures quickly to curb these speculative activities in rural areas, in order to benefit the development of the socialist cause.

### 制止农村中的投机行为

　  制止农村中的投机行为
    目前湖南湘阴县农村中有一部分投机分子，在寻找副业，生产自救的幌子下作投机买卖。有的竟非法利用稻谷煮酒，有的贩卖棉布，有的贩卖木材，有的滥宰生猪。如湘阴黄甲乡全民等农业社的投机分子因用稻谷煮酒造成了严重缺粮现象。东塘汨罗两乡的棉布投机者，不下百人，仅东塘乡尚南、白水两社的布贩，就有五十余人，共计卖出的棉布，在一千匹左右。织布的原料，除一部分是他们从合作部门套购的以外，大部分是利用农业社社员家中的旧棉絮。据以上二社不完全统计，共毁掉棉絮一百七十床，棉衣三百六十多件。冯正坤、冯竹楼、王一林等，为了追求暴利，竟不惜拆毁社员的房屋与祠堂贩卖木材。尚南社曹植松等，大量抢购生猪宰杀，偷漏国税。
    这些投机分子都是以各种非法手段偷漏税收，套购抢购，欺骗农民。有的拿钱向社员套购粮食和放高利贷。如投机分子冯竹楼，便在白水社向冯树清、冯胜初等七户社员，套购粮食六百余斤，冯平安以每元每月利息四角的高利贷，放给社员。
    这些投机分子还纠合在一起破坏农业社。如冯正坤由于专搞投机买卖没有从事劳动，在早中稻预分中，拿不回口粮，他便组织小集团闹退社，阻挠社内插晚稻。这一切，都严重地影响了社会秩序和合作化的巩固。因此，我要求政府迅速采取有效措施，制止农村中的这些投机活动，以利社会主义事业的发展。
