Comprehensive report from our newspaper: According to Xinhua News Agency, Harseh, the representative of the Imam of Oman in Cairo, requested the United Nations on the 20th to intervene in the British aggression against Oman.

Hours before the Security Council discussed whether to include the Omani issue on the agenda, Harseh sent letters to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld and the President of the UN Security Council, Urrutia (Colombia), respectively, making this request.

On August 20, the United Nations Security Council, with five votes against four, yielded to British demands and refused to discuss the Arab countries' accusation of British armed aggression against Oman. The Soviet Union, Iraq, the Philippines, and Sweden voted in favor of discussing the accusation. Britain, France, Australia, Colombia, and Cuba voted against. The United States abstained, and the Chiang Kai-shek clique was absent.

Soviet Representative Sobolev actively supported the Arab countries' request, advocating that the Omani issue be included on the agenda and demanding that effective measures be taken to stop British aggression.

Harseh, the representative of the Imam of Oman in Cairo, said on the 20th that the struggle of the Omani people, which began many years ago, would not be stopped because the Security Council did not include the issue on the agenda. He said, "The Omani people will carry on the fight until final victory."

　  安理会无理拒绝讨论英国侵略行为
　　阿曼人民决不中止反侵略斗争
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息：阿曼教长驻开罗代表哈尔塞20日要求联合国干预英国对阿曼的侵略。
    在安全理事会讨论是否把阿曼问题列入议程以前数小时，哈尔塞分别发信给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德和联合国安全理事会主席乌鲁蒂亚（哥伦比亚），提出了这个要求。
    联合国安全理事会8月20日以五票对四票，顺应英国的要求而拒绝讨论阿拉伯国家对英国武装侵略阿曼的控诉案。赞成讨论控诉案的有苏联、伊拉克、菲律宾和瑞典。反对的有英国、法国、澳大利亚、哥伦比亚和古巴。美国弃权，蒋介石集团缺席。
    苏联代表索波列夫积极支持阿拉伯国家的请求。主张把阿曼问题列入议程，并且要求采取有效措施来制止英国的侵略。
    阿曼教长驻开罗代表哈尔塞20日说，许多年前就已开始的阿曼人民的斗争是不会因安全理事会不把这个问题列入议程而中止的。他说，“阿曼人民将把战斗进行到最后的胜利。”
