	Why Take the Long Route Instead of the Shortcut?

	Originally, water transport has the lowest cost. For example, in the Soviet Union, the Volga River's transport of timber saves nine-tenths of the freight compared to rail; transporting oil saves six-sevenths of the freight. At the same time, rivers have great capacity. The Great Volga River opened in the Soviet Union has a throughput capacity more than forty times greater than any of the largest railways. Therefore, socialist countries pay special attention to water transport.

	However, the current freight rates for inland river shipping in our country are unreasonable in some places, resulting in unreasonable freight flows. For example, the fertilizer produced by the Yongli Ning Factory in Nanjing is not directly transported to Chongqing by water, but is transported to Chongqing via the Jinpu Railway, then transferred to the Longhai Railway, then to the Baocheng Railway and the Chengyu Railway. This is an abnormal phenomenon. Because from Nanjing to Chongqing, shipping by boat is only 2,103 kilometers; by train it is 2,523 kilometers. Why doesn't the factory take the shortcut and insist on taking the long route? It is because water transport is more expensive than land transport. The freight per ton-kilometer is more than 1.8 cents, while the train is only a little more than 1.2 cents. Although the railway detour is 420 kilometers longer than the waterway, the total freight for each ton of fertilizer is still more than 6.4 yuan cheaper than shipping.

	From the perspective of factories, mines, and trade departments, in order to reduce the circulation costs of fertilizer, thereby reducing the sales price to farmers, they would rather take the railway than the Yangtze River.

	Because of this, the following problems arise:

	First, the already strained southern section of the Jinpu Railway and the western section of the Longhai Railway will become even more strained. If the Yongli Ning Factory has 100,000 tons of fertilizer transferred to Sichuan throughout the year, the railway line will increase the freight turnover by 250 million ton-kilometers; and other more important materials supporting the construction of the Northwest will be backlogged.

	Second, conversely, the Yangtze River shipping will lose 210 million tons of upstream cargo. In this way, the two contradictions that originally existed in the Yangtze River shipping—that is, the downstream volume exceeds the shipping capacity of the ships, and the upstream shipping capacity of the ships exceeds the volume—will become more acute, resulting in a large backlog of downstream cargo in Pukou, while a large number of upstream ships will be empty. In the first quarter of this year, the Nanjing Port Authority's upstream shipping capacity of ships was more than 30,000 tons not utilized.

	From the above situation, it is obvious that the Ministry of Communications was not thoughtful enough when formulating freight rates. Since the opening of the Baocheng Railway, there have been two routes for materials entering Sichuan, and various units have the possibility of choosing transportation tools. The unreasonableness of water transport freight rates and its consequences have become more obvious.

	In order to reduce the burden on the railway, develop the business of the water transport department, and save the circulation costs of industrial and agricultural products, I hope that the Ministry of Communications can consider comprehensively revising water transport freight rates as soon as possible.

### 为什么近路不走走远路？

    为什么近路不走走远路？
    本来，水运的成本是最低廉的。如苏联伏尔加河水运木材，比铁路节省十分之九的运费；运输石油，节省七分之六的运费。同时河流的通过能力也大，像苏联开辟的大伏尔加河，通过能力将比任何一条最大铁路的转运量大四十多倍。所以社会主义国家特别注重水运。
    但是，目前我国内河航运的运价，有些地方很不合理，因此造成了不合理的货物流向。例如，南京永利宁厂出产的肥田粉，就不从水路直接运往重庆，而是通过津浦铁路转陇海铁路再转宝成铁路和成渝铁路运往重庆。这是一种反常的现象。因为从南京到重庆，用船运只有二千一百零三公里；用火车运则要走二千五百二十三公里。为什么工厂不走近路偏偏要走远路呢？就是因为水运比陆运贵。每吨公里的运费，要一分八厘多钱，火车只要一分二厘多一点。火车绕道运输，虽然比水路长四百二十公里，但每吨肥田粉的全程运费，仍比船运要便宜六元四角多。
    从厂矿、贸易部门的角度来看，为了减少肥田粉的流转费用，从而降低对农民的销售价格，就宁肯走铁路而不走长江了。
    正因为如此，就产生了以下的问题：
    一、原来就已经紧张的津浦铁路南段和陇海铁路西段将更加紧张。假若永利宁厂全年有十万吨肥田粉调四川，铁路线上就将增加两亿五千万吨公里的货物周转量；而其他更重要的支援西北建设的物资就将被积压下来。
    二、反之，长江航运的上水货源则将损失两亿一千万吨。这样，原来长江航运中存在的两个矛盾——即下水运量超过轮船运力而上水轮船运力超过运量的矛盾，将更加尖锐，结果就会造成下水货物在浦口大量积压，而上水轮船则大量放空。今年第一季度，南京港务局的轮船上水运力就有三万多吨没有被利用。
    从上述情况看来，显然交通部在制订运价时是考虑得很不周到的。而自宝成铁路通车后，物资进川已有两条路线，各单位有了选择运输工具的可能，水运运价不合理和它所造成的后果就更加明显地暴露出来了。
    为了减轻铁路的负担，发展水运部门的业务，和节省工农业产品的流转费用，我希望交通部能早日考虑全面修改水运运价。
