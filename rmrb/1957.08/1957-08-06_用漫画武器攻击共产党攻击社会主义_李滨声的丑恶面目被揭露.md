Using Cartoon Weapons to Attack the Communist Party and Socialism
Li Binsheng's Ugly Face Exposed

    This report from our newspaper: Recently, the staff of the Beijing Daily have held continuous meetings to expose the reactionary face of Li Binsheng, the rightist element and art editor of the newspaper, who used cartoons as weapons to launch wild attacks against the Party and the socialist cause.

    Before the start of the rectification campaign, Li Binsheng had already drawn some cartoons spreading poison. After the start of the rectification campaign, Li Binsheng drew even more concentrated anti-Party and anti-socialist cartoons. In cartoons such as "In Some Units" and "Parrots and People Who Specialize in Learning Leaders' Speeches," he depicted people who won awards in the office as people without mouths, and compared cadres who acted according to the leaders' intentions to parrots, distorting the Party and the state's cadre policy and inciting the masses to oppose the leadership. In the cartoon "Ma Daha's Report" (not published), he viciously slandered activists for using attacks on others as a means of joining the Party, slandered Party organizations for only liking this kind of person, and attacked the Party's reporting system. In the cartoon "In a Certain University," which he co-created with Wang Fuyang, he fabricated accusations that the university's school affairs meeting was squeezing out and suppressing professors. After inspecting work as a representative of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress, Li Binsheng published a series of cartoons entitled "Inspection Notes," in which the cartoon "One Person, Two Positions" deliberately distorted the relationship between public and private in joint public-private enterprises. Under everyone's exposure and criticism, Li Binsheng himself had to admit that in the several joint public-private enterprises he inspected, there was no situation like the one he depicted in "One Person, Two Positions," where the public shareholder representative monopolized everything and the enthusiasm of the private party could not be brought into play, and that the reason he drew this picture was "to make this series of notes more weighty."

    According to the materials that have already been revealed, Li Binsheng's reactionary thinking has been consistent. As early as his student days, he and the Kuomintang district branch committee in the school ran a reactionary wall newspaper together, drew cartoons to slander the liberated areas, distort the land reform, and uglify the Eighth Route Army. He also participated in anti-Soviet demonstrations and actively wrote reactionary slogans. During this period, he also published some cartoons in the reactionary "Pacific" monthly magazine that slandered the Soviet Union. His reactionary thinking was not transformed after liberation. In the past few years, he has worked in three different organizations, all of which have stood in a hostile position, picking on the faults of the Party organization and attacking the Party. He arrogantly believes that the Party cannot lead art.

    Now, Li Binsheng has not completely confessed his reactionary words and deeds, and even says that he will not be able to draw cartoons in the future, in order to resist others' criticism of him. The staff of the Beijing Daily are continuing to expose his ugly face.

### 用漫画武器攻击共产党攻击社会主义  李滨声的丑恶面目被揭露

    用漫画武器攻击共产党攻击社会主义
    李滨声的丑恶面目被揭露
    本报讯　北京日报工作人员最近连续开会，揭露了该报美术组编辑、右派分子李滨声以漫画为武器向党、向社会主义事业大肆攻击的反动面目。
    整风运动开始以前，李滨声就画过一些散布毒素的漫画。整风运动开始以后，李滨声更集中地画了一些反党反社会主义的漫画，他在“在某些单位”、“鹦鹉和专学领导讲话的人”等漫画中，把在机关中得奖的人画成没有嘴的人，把按领导意图办事的干部比做鹦鹉，歪曲党和国家的干部政策，煽动群众与领导对立。在“马大哈汇报”这幅漫画（未见报）中，他恶毒地诬蔑积极分子用打击别人作为入党手段，诬蔑党组织只欢喜这种人，攻击党的汇报制度。他同王复羊合作的漫画“在某大学里”，无中生有地诬蔑大学的校务会议排挤和压制教授。李滨声以北京市人民代表的身份视察工作后，发表了题为“视察随笔”的一组漫画，其中“一身二任”一幅，别有用心地歪曲公私合营企业中的公私关系。在大家的揭发和批判下，李滨声自己也不得不承认在他所视察的几个公私合营企业中，根本没有像他在“一身二任”中所画的公股代表包揽一切、私方人员积极性不能发挥的情况，而他所以画出这幅画，是“想使这组随笔更有分量些”。
    根据已经揭发的材料，李滨声的反动思想是有一贯性的。早在学生时代，他就和学校里的国民党区分部委员在一起办反动壁报，画漫画污蔑解放区，歪曲土地改革，丑化八路军，并参加了反苏大游行，积极地写反动标语。在这期间，他还在反动的“太平洋”月刊上发表过一些污蔑苏联的漫画。他的反动思想，解放后并没有得到改造。几年来他先后在三个机关工作过，都是站在敌对立场挑剔党组织的毛病，向党进攻。他狂妄地认为党不能领导艺术。
    现在，李滨声对自己的反动言行还没有彻底交代，还说什么今后漫画没法画了，以此抗拒别人对他的批判。北京日报工作人员正在继续揭露他的丑恶面目。
