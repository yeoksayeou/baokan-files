    A Snakeberry
    ——A Repudiation of an Article in “Yan River”
    Su Fang
    In the bamboo forests of rural Sichuan, there often grows a type of fungus called snakeberry. This fungus is a dizzyingly red color, delicately beautiful, yet highly poisonous. It is said to grow from the saliva of poisonous snakes dripping into the soil. Recently, after reading an article entitled “Essays, Satire, and Humor,” I deeply felt that the snakeberry is the best metaphor for this article.
    “Essays, Satire, and Humor” was published in the July issue of “Yan River” (Author: Zhu Baochang). The title of this article is ostensibly upright—the author expresses his opinion on the discussion in certain newspapers and periodicals about whether or not essays are necessary, arguing that essays cannot be abolished; the article is not without many beautifully crafted phrases; even some of the paragraphs seem to be praising the Party and the new society. However, these, like the bright colors of the snakeberry, cannot conceal the essence of the article, or the ugly face of the author, who is shouting wildly from an anti-Party and anti-socialist standpoint.
    The author uses his own “painful experiences” to prove that satire is needed, taking the opportunity to hurl a venomous arrow at the leader of his unit (school). He uses all sorts of vicious words to berate this leader. He says that he is the embodiment of the Indian goddess “Dark Heaven,” that he “drags others by the ears and instructs them” when speaking to them, that “wherever he leads, the students there become sallow and emaciated, unable to obtain spiritual nourishment”; the author, in describing this leader’s “ignorance and lack of knowledge,” maliciously distorts the meaning of the term “heroic figure.” He says: “Whether or not one's writing is coherent is not very important for being a heroic figure. Isn’t my leader illiterate? He himself admits it. But because he is a heroic figure, he can judge that my thinking is incorrect.” Isn't this indirectly scolding our heroic figures as ignorant and “feudal”?
    After slandering the leader, the author's intention becomes even clearer, as his spearhead is thus extended to point at our entire Party. He writes the relationship between the Party and the masses as so terrible: “Some Party members and non-Party members are separated not just by a wall, but by ten thousand mountains. Non-Party people see some Party members as mice see cats. These Party members utter words that are scriptures and speak words that become law.” He also says: “In our country today, several million Communist Party members are not several million living Buddhas born from lotus flowers, and the six hundred million people united around the great Party are not six hundred million pure and kind saintly monks and elders.” Here, we cannot help but ask this Zhu Baochang, is it true that the solemn laws of our country are, as he says, only established by some Party members? Is it true that, in his mind, the most great and sublime are only living Buddhas born from lotus flowers and saintly monks and elders? Does he not know that the Chinese people stood up from the pool of blood under the leadership of the Communist Party? Can he not see the great achievements made by the people of the whole country in building the motherland under the leadership of the Party? Yes, he cannot see these things. All he sees is: dark corners, so dark that he has “no freedom to expose the darkness, nor the happiness of praising the light.” However, we might as well tell the author that, standing on a hostile position to look at things, he will indeed not be able to distinguish what is light and what is dark; and the people will never allow class enemies the slightest freedom!
    Zhu Baochang repeatedly emphasizes in his article: Satirists also have "a heart that is fresh, red, and pure." But after reading his article, we can clearly see that the reason he says this is merely to dress himself up as a "loyal" person, to conceal his murderous intent in attacking the Party. During the rectification period, didn't the rightists also carry out their anti-Party activities under the guise of "helping the Party rectify its work"?
    The "Yan River" editors mentioned this article in the editor's note, from which we can understand that it is not accidental that this snakeberry can "stand proudly" on the "Yan River" bank. The editor's note writes: "Mr. Zhu Baochang's discussion in 'Essays, Satire, and Humor' about the nature of essays, and about the issue of praise and exposure, also needs further study." This way of extracting the political content and class content of the work and simply attributing it to views on essays will obviously blur the reader's vision. At this point, we cannot help but ask the "Yan River" editors, what is the intention behind writing such an editor's note!

### 一支蛇泡子——斥“延河”上的一篇文章

    一支蛇泡子
    ——斥“延河”上的一篇文章
    苏方
    四川乡间的竹林里，常常生有一种叫蛇泡子的菌类植物。这种菌类植物色泽晕红，娇艳美丽，然而毒气却很大。因为据说它是毒蛇的唾液滴入土中生出来的。最近读到一篇题为“杂文、讽刺和风趣”的文章，深深感到蛇泡子就是这篇文章的最好的比喻。
    “杂文、讽刺和风趣”发表在7月号的“延河”上（作者：朱宝昌）。这篇文章命题光明正大——作者对某些报刊上关于要不要杂文的讨论发表意见，认为杂文是不可废除的；文中不乏许多雕琢得很漂亮的词句；甚至其中有些段落似乎也是在歌颂党，歌颂新社会的。然而这些就跟蛇泡子的鲜艳的色泽一样，并不能掩饰这篇文章的实质，掩饰作者站在反党反社会主义的立场上猖狂叫嚣的丑恶面貌。
    作者用他亲身经受的“痛苦经验”来证明讽刺是需要的时候，趁机对他所在单位（学校）的领导人投射出一支毒箭。他用各式各样恶毒的字眼来谩骂这位领导人。说他是印度女神“黑暗天”的化身，说他对别人讲话时是“耳提面命”，说他“在那儿领导，那儿的学生就面黄肌瘦，得不到精神的粮食”；作者在形容这位领导人的“愚昧无知”的时候，更是恶意地歪曲了“英雄人物”这个词的涵义。他说：“文字通不通对于作为一个英雄人物并没多大关系。我的领导不就一字不通么？他自己也承认。但因为是英雄人物之故，就能判断我的思想不正确。”这不是指桑骂槐地把我们的英雄人物都骂作是无知的，“封”的么？
    在谩骂了领导以后，作者的用意也就愈加明显，因为他的矛头由此引申出来而指向我们整个党了。他把党和群众的关系写得这样可怕：“某些党员和非党员不止是相隔一道墙，而是相隔万重山。非党人士看见了某些党员，如同老鼠看见猫。这些党员是吐词为经，出言成法。”他又说：“在今天我们的国家里，一千几百万共产党员并不是一千几百万莲花化生的活佛，团结在伟大的党的周围的六亿人民也并不是六亿纯洁善良的圣僧长老。”在这里，我们不禁要请问这位朱宝昌，难道我们国家庄严的法令，真的如他所说只是某些党员立下的吗？难道在他的心目中，最伟大最崇高的就只是莲花化身的活佛和圣僧长老吗？他难道不知道中国人民是在共产党的领导之下由血泊中站起来的吗？他难道看不到在党的领导下全国人民在建设祖国方面取得的伟大成就吗？是的，他是看不见这些的。他所看到的只是：黑暗的角落，黑暗得使他“没有揭露黑暗的自由，也没有歌颂光明的幸福”。但是，我们也不妨告诉作者，像他这样站在敌对的立场上来看待事物，他确实会分不清什么是光明，什么是黑暗的；而人民也决不容许阶级敌人有丝毫自由！
    朱宝昌在文章里一再强调：讽刺者也有“一颗鲜红洁白的良心”。但是读了他的文章以后，我们可以清楚地看出，他所以这样说，不过是要把自己打扮成一个“忠心耿耿”的人，来掩盖他向党进攻的杀机罢了。整风期中，右派分子不是也打着“帮助党整风”的幌子来进行他们的反党活动的吗？
    “延河”编者在编后记中提到了这篇文章，从中我们可以理解到这支蛇泡子能够“傲然挺立”在“延河”边上不是偶然的。编后记中这样写着：“朱宝昌先生在‘杂文、讽刺与风趣’中所谈到的关于杂文的性质，关于歌颂与暴露的问题也是需要作进一步研究的。”这种抽掉作品的政治内容、阶级内容，单纯把它归结为对杂文的看法的说法，显然是会模糊读者视听的。至此，我们不禁要请问“延河”编者，这样写编后记的居心何在了！
