Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 12th: Approximately two hundred Soviet scientists, in a statement concerning the banning and cessation of nuclear weapon testing, suggested that scientists from all countries hold extensive international talks to earnestly discuss various issues that cause them unease due to the harmful effects of radioactivity and the threat posed by the use of atomic energy for war purposes.

    The statement said that Soviet scientists support the proposition that an international conference on the issue of banning atomic weapons must be convened. Not only atomic scientists, but also representatives from other scientific fields (biologists, medical scientists, philosophers of all schools, economists, historians, sociologists, educators, etc.) should express valuable opinions at a broad international conference attended by well-known figures in the scientific community.

    Among the scientists who signed this statement are Nesmeyanov, Semenov, Barkin, Topchiev, Skobeltsyn, Ostrovityanov, etc.

    The statement said, "We clearly see that scientists from various countries may adopt different attitudes on how to achieve the goal of banning nuclear weapons. These differences arise from their different worldviews and often directly depend on the policies of the ruling groups in their respective countries. However, we believe that the aforementioned differences are not an insurmountable obstacle to enabling scientists from various countries to adopt a common stance, in line with the peace aspirations of the people of all countries, on the major issue of preventing nuclear war. Therefore, scientists from all countries should be jointly concerned about the danger threatening humanity and should unite to fight for the immediate banning and cessation of nuclear weapon testing and for the prevention of war."

    The statement concluded, "We Soviet scientists are fully prepared to act jointly with scientists from any country and are ready at any time to discuss any proposals aimed at preventing atomic war and ensuring peace and tranquility for all of humanity."

    苏联科学家建议各国同行
    会谈禁止核武器问题
    新华社13日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科12日讯：苏联二百名左右的科学家在一篇有关禁止和停止试验核武器问题的声明中建议，各国科学家举行广泛的国际会谈，以便认真地讨论因放射性的危害作用和利用原子能于战争目的所造成的威胁而引起他们不安的各项问题。
    声明中说，苏联科学家支持必须召开禁止原子武器问题的国际会议的主张。不只是让原子科学家，而且也让其他科学部门的代表（生物学家、医学家、各个派别的哲学家、经济学家、历史学家、社会学家、教育学家等）都在科学界知名人士参加的广泛的国际会议上发表有价值的意见。
    在这个声明上签字的科学家中，包括涅斯米扬诺夫、谢苗诺夫、巴尔金、托普切夫、斯科贝尔琴、奥斯特罗维季扬诺夫等。
    声明中说，我们看得很清楚，各国科学家对如何达到禁止核武器这个目的，可能采取不同的态度，这种分歧是由于他们的世界观不同，并且往往直接取决于各国统治集团的政策。但是我们认为，要使各国科学家在防止核战争这件重大的事件方面采取符合各国人民和平愿望的共同立场，上面所说的分歧并不是一种不可克服的阻碍。所以，所有国家的科学家都应该共同关心威胁人类的危险，并且应该联合起来为争取立即禁止和停止试验核武器、为防止战争而斗争。
    声明最后说，我们苏联科学家有充分准备同任何国家的科学家共同行动，随时准备讨论任何旨在防止原子战争、保证和平和全人类安宁的建议。
