　　Beijing: 830,000 People Have Received Contraception Education

　　(Our Newspaper) Since Beijing began a relatively widespread contraception promotion campaign in October 1956, it has achieved certain results, and the number of people practicing contraception is increasing.

　　Judging from the increased sales figures of several major contraceptives in the first and second quarters of this year, many citizens of Beijing have a need for contraception. In the first quarter of this year, the city sold more than 3,900 diaphragms, and in the second quarter, this increased to more than 5,900. In the first quarter, more than 380,000 condoms were sold, and in the second quarter, this increased to more than 510,000. In the first quarter, more than 13,000 tubes of contraceptive cream were sold, and in the second quarter, this increased to more than 23,000 tubes.

　　Since October last year, hospitals and maternal and child health stations throughout the city have generally opened contraception clinics, and at the same time, they have supplied contraceptive drugs and devices, providing many conveniences for those who require contraception. Contraception exhibitions have been held in most districts, and films and slides on contraception have been shown. At the same time, medical personnel have been organized to give reports on contraception knowledge in factories, mines, organizations, and street residents. These have been welcomed by the masses. According to statistics, approximately 830,000 people have received contraception education, accounting for approximately 40% of the city's adult population. However, contraception promotion work still needs to be further and more extensively carried out.

　　北京受到避孕宣传的达八十三万人次
    本报讯　北京市从1956年10月开始较为广泛地开展避孕宣传以来，已经收到一定的效果，实行避孕人数正在增多。
    从今年第一、二季度几种主要避孕药械销售量增长的数字来看，北京的很多市民是有避孕要求的。今年第一季度全市共售出子宫帽三千九百多个，第二季度增加到五千九百多个。第一季度共售出阴茎套三十八万多个，第二季度增加到五十一万多个。第一季度共售出避孕药膏一万三千多管，第二季度增加到两万三千多管。
    从去年10月开始，全市的医院、妇幼保健站普遍开展了避孕门诊，同时还供应避孕药械，给要求避孕的人很多方便。在大部分的区里都举办了避孕展览会，放映有关避孕的电影和幻灯，同时还组织医务人员到厂矿、机关团体和街道居民中做关于避孕常识的报告。这些都受到群众的欢迎。据统计目前受到避孕宣传教育的约有八十三万人次，占全市成年人口的40％左右。但是避孕宣传工作还有待进一步广泛深入开展。
