Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, August 5th: Anshan Iron and Steel Company has decided to conduct a major quality inspection in August and September to produce more high-quality products to meet the needs of national production and construction. This was proposed by Ma Bin, manager of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, on behalf of the company at a recent meeting of factory and mine leaders and cadres.

In the production increase and conservation campaign in the first half of this year, twenty major products of Anshan Iron and Steel, such as sintered ore, metallurgical coke, pig iron, and heavy rails, all exceeded the quality indicators stipulated by the state. However, Anshan Iron and Steel still has some products that cannot meet the needs of the country. In the first half of this year, cast iron pipes and a new type of steel billet did not meet the national quality standards; the product qualification rate was low; many heavy rail steel products were still being repurposed; silicon steel sheets could not be produced in large quantities; and the aeration rate of Guangdong-style bricks was high. User factories had complaints about the quality of refractory bricks and medium plates. In his report, Ma Bin particularly emphasized the great significance of improving product quality. He said that producing one more ton of first-class heavy rail would create more than 100 yuan more wealth for the country than industrial rail; producing one ton of silicon steel sheet is not only equivalent to the value of four tons of ordinary steel, but can also save the country foreign exchange. He asked all factories and mines to repeatedly and thoroughly publicize the significance of improving product quality to the masses of workers.

Manager Ma Bin pointed out that through this comprehensive and in-depth quality inspection, it is necessary to establish various systems for implementing rewards, inspections, and supervision for improving quality, in order to ensure the production of more high-quality steel products for the country.

    生产优质钢铁！
    鞍钢开展产品质量大检查
    据新华社鞍山5日电　鞍山钢铁公司决定在8、9月份进行一次质量大检查，以便生产更多优质产品满足国家生产建设需要。这是鞍钢公司经理马宾代表公司在最近召开的厂矿长干部会议上提出来的。
    在今年上半年的增产节约运动中，鞍钢的烧结矿、冶金焦、生铁、重轨等二十种主要产品，都突破了国家规定的质量指标。但是，鞍钢目前仍然有部分产品不能适应国家的需要。今年上半年，有铸铁管和一种新钢坯没有达到国家的质量指标；产品的合格率较低；重轨钢改变用途的仍然很多，釸钢片不能大量的生产；粤土砖气孔率高；用厂对耐火砖、中板的质量有意见。马宾在报告中，特别强调提高产品质量的重大意义。他说，多生产一吨一级品重轨，就比工业用轨能多给国家创造一百多元的财富；生产一吨釸钢片，不仅相当于四吨普通钢材的价值，而且还能为国家节省外汇。他要求各厂矿反复地向职工群众深入宣传提高产品质量的意义。
    马宾经理指出，通过这次全面、深入的质量大检查，要建立贯彻提高质量的奖励、检查、监督等各种制度，以便保证给国家生产更多的优等质量的钢铁产品。
