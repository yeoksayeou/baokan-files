    What Words!

    Liu Tiehua, a cadre of the Xinyang Prefectural Planning Committee in Henan, harbored deep hatred for the new society. He said, "Although the cannibalistic old society has passed, its terrible legacy remains." He said, "’Those who speak are not guilty, those who hear should take warning’ is a smokescreen. In reality, those who speak are guilty, and those who hear do not take warning." "The Communist Party turns red in the face when it hears criticism, adopts a condescending attitude, and uses sticks and caps indiscriminately, bringing the weight of Mount Tai to bear and retaliating on any pretext," "It is not as good as Wu Zetian, but more like Emperor Yang of Sui." He falsely accused the Party's cadre policy of "promoting those who are agreeable, being jealous of the virtuous and capable, valuing obedience, and hating straightforwardness." It is "praising the compliant, seconding the agreeable, and causing trouble for the straightforward."

    Guo Wenxuan, Deputy Director of the Luoyang Municipal Cultural Relics Management Committee and a member of the China Democratic League, said, "In the past, Chiang Kai-shek held positions such as Chairman and President, and the people did not dare to say a word because he used force to subdue people. Now, big and small leaders rely solely on being Party members to control people by the Party." "The Communist Party is even more evil than the Kuomintang." He also said, "Party members stand above the ninth heaven, while the masses are pushed down to the eighteenth level of hell. Party members are not just superior, but ten times superior." He also called Party members "simple-minded and well-developed." He said that now "the government, banks, army, and even newspapers all carry the word 'People's,' and everything is called 'the People's.' This is the culmination of the policies to fool the people, from ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign. Even the most basic people—the working class—have no food to last overnight."

    Wang Zhuyun, an engineer at the Fushun Oil Shale Research Institute, said that before liberation, during the Kuomintang era, there were four big families—Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen. Now we also have "four big families"—the Party, the government, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League. However, the scope of the new "four big families" is somewhat larger than in the past.

    Su Xue of the Jilin Provincial Urban Construction Bureau said that now, the Communist Party "always uses class struggle to govern the people," "The old society was divided into rich and poor, and now it is divided into Party members and non-Party members. This kind of struggle is a devastation to the people... This side is heaven, that side is hell... Divide and kill, divide and rule, this is rule by force."

    什么话
    河南信阳专署计划委员会干部刘铁华对新社会有着刻骨的仇恨，他说：“吃人的旧社会虽然过去了，但可怕的遗风依然存在”，他说：“言者无罪、闻者足戒是个幌子，实际上是言者有罪，闻者不戒。”“共产党是闻到批评，面红耳赤，居高临下，棍帽齐来，泰山压顶，借端报复”，“不如武则天，倒像隋炀帝”。他诬蔑党的干部政策是：“破格用己，姤贤忌能，以顺为贵，以直为仇”。是“捧一顺二直倒霉”。
    洛阳市文物管理委员会副主任、民盟盟员郭文轩说：“过去蒋介石兼过委员长、总裁等职，人民不敢吭声，是以力服人；现在大小领导只凭党员一点，是以党服人。”“共产党真比国民党还恶”。还说“党员站在九霄以上，把群众打到十八层地狱之下，党员不是高人一等，而是高人十等。”他还骂党员是“头脑简单，四肢发达”。说现在“政府、银行、军队以至报纸上都带着人民二字，什么都说成人民的，这是集古今中外愚民政策之大成。即是最基本的人民——工人阶级也是家无隔宿之粮。”
    抚顺油母页岩研究所工程师汪竹云说，解放前，国民党时期有四大家族——蒋、宋、孔、陈，我们现在也有“四大家族”——党、政、工、青。不过新的“四大家族”的范围比过去扩大了些。
    吉林省城市建设局苏雪说，现在，共产党“老是用阶级斗争来治理人民”，“旧社会分成贫富，现在分党内外，这种斗争是对人民的摧残，……这边是天堂，那边是地狱……分而残杀，分而治之，这是强力的统治。”
