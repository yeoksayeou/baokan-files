    Hubei Daily Manuscript:

    The Heping Agricultural Cooperative in Pengxing Township, Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, held a debate. Female cooperative member Liang Qunying said at the meeting: "Who says cooperation is not good? I think cooperation is very good. Take grain as an example, the yield has increased year by year. Last year it was a 'thousand-jin township', and this year's early rice yield has also increased compared to last year. Can this be said that cooperation is not good?"

    湖北孝感县朋兴乡和平农业社，召开了辩论会，女社员梁群英在会上说：“谁说合作化不好，我看合作化好的很。就拿粮食来说，一年比一年增产，去年是千斤乡，今年的早稻又比去年增了产，这能说合作化不好吗？”
