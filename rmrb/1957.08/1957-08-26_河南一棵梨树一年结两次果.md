　　Xinhua News Agency

　　In Chenjia Village, Fugou County, Henan Province, a pear tree bears pears twice a year. A new harvest of pears was recently picked, and the second batch of pears is almost ripe again.

　　According to the farmers of this village, when this pear tree first blossomed and bore fruit, it was the same as ordinary pear trees, except that the pears were as small as dates. As soon as the small pears ripened, the tree blossomed and bore the second batch of pears, which were plentiful and large, each weighing between five and seven taels. Moreover, they taste sweet and can be stored until the following spring without rotting. The farmers of this village are very fond of this pear tree and have already grafted more than a hundred trees.

　　河南一棵梨树一年结两次果
    河南省扶沟县陈贾村，一棵梨树一年结两次梨。不久以前才采摘了一次新梨，现在结的第二次梨又快成熟了。
    据这个村的农民反映：这棵梨树第一次开花结果的时候和普通梨树一样，只是梨小得和枣一样大。小梨一成熟就开花结第二次梨，结的又多又大，每个重五两到七两，而且味道甜美，可以贮存到次年春天不烂。这个村的农民非常喜欢这棵梨树，现在已经接植一百多棵。
