After attending the concert performed by the General Political Department Song and Dance Troupe in celebration of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, I felt moved and filled with emotion. Our military music is a powerful and inseparable part of our entire musical culture. For thirty years, ever since we had our revolutionary armed forces, military music work began. These thirty years of military music have almost depicted the entire era of revolutionary armed struggle. For those of us around thirty years old, even without going too far back, just hearing songs like "The Big Sword March," "National Salvation Song," "On the Taihang Mountains," "Guerrilla Song," "Eighth Route Army Song," "Ode to Yan'an," and "Yan River Ballad," the entire era of the arduous struggle of the War of Resistance Against Japan vividly appears before our eyes. Military music has recorded the history of revolutionary armed struggle, and educated the people of this era, enabling them to be filled with revolutionary pride and a serious sense of responsibility for their work when they recall their past lives. Whenever I come into contact with military music, these feelings are always very strong.

Thirty years have passed, and the current situation is very different from the past. We have established professional military art troupes, with complete choirs, orchestras, and professional teams of various artistic styles. The artistic expressiveness is unprecedentedly rich. Looking at the grand musical performance of the General Political Department Song and Dance Troupe this time, and recalling the situation of doing national salvation propaganda work during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the persecution of artists in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, how could I not feel moved in this regard?

The comrades of the General Political Department Song and Dance Troupe, with selfless enthusiasm, have just returned from a tour of performances in the army, and have created and rehearsed a batch of new works in the struggle against the rightists to participate in this commemorative performance celebrating the 30th anniversary of the army's founding. Most of these works are being officially performed for the first time. Among them, many works, such as the chorus "Glorious People's Liberation Army," the folk instrumental performance "The People and Their Soldiers," the male chorus "Sergeant's Letter," "Playing the Wooden Horse," "Missing My Sweetheart So Much I'm Bewildered," the female chorus "Want a Mother-in-Law," "Pomegranate Flowers Blooming Red," the folk song performances "Worry to Death," "Little Son-in-Law," the mixed chorus "Love Good Labor," and some solo songs, have all left a deep impression on people. Although we cannot say that all the new works are written with the same success, and some of them have not even been written well, the overall impression is very satisfactory, because most of these works inherit the revolutionary optimism of military music works over the past thirty years. In terms of melody, they can also pay attention to national characteristics and mass appeal like the previous military works, and the genres and themes of the works are broader. The sixth movement of the "Glorious People's Liberation Army" chorus, "Celebrating Victory," is indeed a good work closely related to tradition, and has many similarities in melody characteristics with Xinghai's several choruses. Many works are also closely related to folk music, with obvious national characteristics. Such a creative direction should be adhered to.

In this concert, the General Political Department Song and Dance Troupe not only provided us with a batch of new works, but also introduced a batch of new people. In the concert, we clearly saw that a group of young and excellent actors have been cultivated. In this concert, the number of actors serving as soloists and lead singers reached as many as fourteen or fifteen, which is a very gratifying phenomenon. It is probably rare for other groups to have more than a dozen people serving as soloists and lead singers in a concert. In this performance, some old actors with stage experience certainly sang well, but it is more accurate to say that the performance standard was maintained by many young actors who met the audience for the first time and created extraordinary brilliance. The lead singing of comrades E Linmu and Li Qinghua in the female and male choruses was simply very moving, especially when they sang "Pomegranate Flowers Blooming Red," "Want a Mother-in-Law," and "Missing My Sweetheart So Much I'm Bewildered," it can be said that it was an unforgettable song, vivid in image and profound in artistic conception. Another example is the solo singer Comrade Xu Youguang, who can be said to be a newcomer who has been trained in the past one or two years, and her singing has already reached a high artistic level and is warmly loved by the audience. Seeing that our country is constantly emerging with new outstanding talents, I am truly indescribably happy. I hope that the General Political Department Song and Dance Troupe will continue to adhere to this style and allow more actors to have the opportunity to train.

Watching the performance of the General Political Department Song and Dance Troupe in the fierce struggle against the rightists cannot help but make us feel more confident. The rightists attack us, saying that the Party cannot lead artistic work, saying that the present is not as good as the past, and saying that new people cannot be cultivated. I think the performance of the General Political Department Song and Dance Troupe is the most powerful answer. The army's music work has been growing under the leadership of the Party for thirty years. Without the leadership of the Party, without the thirty years of struggle of the revolutionary armed forces, there could be no achievements today, isn't that clear enough? Under the leadership of the Party and the cultivation of the socialist system, the army's music work, like other art departments, is advancing by leaps and bounds. The performance of the General Political Department Song and Dance Troupe gave the rightists a resounding slap in the face, and the sound of this slap was indeed very crisp.

    听总政歌舞团的音乐会后
    叶林
    在中国人民解放军建军三十周年纪念的时候来听总政文工团歌舞团演出的音乐会，心里是激动和充满感触的。我们的部队音乐是我们整个音乐文化中不可分割的强大的一环，三十年来，自从有了我们的革命武装，就开始有了部队的音乐工作。这三十年来的部队音乐几乎刻划了革命武装斗争的整个狂飙时代。对于我们这些三十岁左右的人，远的不必说，只要是能听到“大刀进行曲”、“救国军歌”、“太行山上”、“游击军歌”、“八路军军歌”、“延安颂”和“延水谣”等等歌曲，整个抗日战争艰苦斗争的年代便历历如在眼前。部队音乐纪录了革命武装斗争的历史，并且教育了这个时代的人，使人们在回忆起过去的生活时能够充满了革命的自豪心和对自己的工作充满严肃的责任感。每当接触到部队音乐，这样的感触总是十分强烈的。
    三十年过去了，现在的情况已经和过去大不相同，我们已经建立了专业的部队艺术团体，有完整的合唱队、乐队和多种多样的艺术样式的专业队伍，艺术表现力是空前地丰富了。看着总政歌舞团这次盛大的音乐演出，回想起过去在抗日战争时作救亡宣传工作和在国统区艺术工作者被迫害的情景，难道在这方面又能够没有感触吗？
    总政歌舞团的同志们这次以忘我的工作热情，刚刚从部队中巡回演出归来，又在反右派的斗争中创作和排练了一批新作品来参加这次庆祝建军三十周年的纪念演出。这些作品大都是第一次正式上演的，其中有好些作品，如大合唱“光荣的人民解放军”，民间器乐演奏“老百姓和子弟兵”，男声小合唱“上士的信”、“跳木马”、“想亲亲想到迷了窍”，女声小合唱“要婆婆”、“石榴花开胭脂红”，民歌演唱“愁死人”、“小女婿”，混声合唱“爱的是好劳动”以及一些独唱曲等，都给人以深刻的印象。尽管我们不能说所有的新作品都写得同样的成功，其中有一些甚至还没有写好，但总的印象却是十分满意的，因为在这些作品中大都继承了三十年来部队音乐作品的革命乐观主义精神，在音调上也能像过去的部队作品一样地注意到民族性与群众性，并且，在作品的体裁与题材等方面是更加宽广了。像“光荣的人民解放军”大合唱中的第六曲“欢庆胜利”，确是一首和传统有紧密联系的好作品，和星海的几部大合唱在音调的特征上有许多共同之处。好些作品和民间音乐的关系也很紧密，有着明显的民族性格。这样的创作方向是应该坚持的。
    总政歌舞团在这次音乐会中不仅给我们提供了一批新作品，而且还介绍了一批新的人。在音乐会中，我们清楚地看到，一批年青的优秀演员是培养起来了。这次在音乐会中担任独唱和领唱的演员竟达到十四、五人之多，这种现象真是十分可喜的。让十几个人在一个音乐会上担任独唱和领唱，这在其它的团体，恐怕是比较少有的。这次的演出，一些有舞台经验的老演员固然唱得不错，但与其说是由老演员保持着演出的水准，倒不如说更多地是由许多第一次和观众见面的青年演员创造了奇异的光辉。像鄂林木和李清华这两位同志在女声和男声小合唱中的领唱，简直是十分动人的，特别是在他们唱“石榴花开胭脂红”、“要婆婆”和“想亲亲想到迷了窍”的时候，真可谓一曲难忘，形象生动，意境深远。又如独唱演员徐有光同志，她可以说是百分之百地在最近一两年间才培养出来的新人，而她的演唱已经具有很高的艺术水平，为观众所热烈爱戴了。看到了我们的国家不断地涌现着新的优秀人才，心里真是说不出的高兴。我希望总政歌舞团继续坚持这样的作风，让更多的演员能够得到锻炼的机会。
    在反右派的激烈斗争中看总政歌舞团的演出，不由得更使我们感到理直气壮。右派分子攻击我们，说党不能领导艺术工作，说是今不如昔，说是培养不出新人。我看总政歌舞团的演出就是最有力的回答。军队的音乐工作三十年来一直是在党的领导下壮大起来的。没有党的领导，没有革命武装三十年来的斗争，就不可能有今天的成绩，难道这还不够清楚吗？在党的领导和在社会主义制度的培养下，部队的音乐工作正和其它的艺术部门一样，在大踏步地前进。总政歌舞团的演出给右派分子们打了一记响亮的耳光，这记耳光的声音确是十分清脆的。
