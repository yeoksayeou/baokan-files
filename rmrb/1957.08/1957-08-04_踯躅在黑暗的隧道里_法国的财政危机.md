    Wandering in a Dark Tunnel
    —France's Financial Crisis—
    Zhang Fan
    France's current financial situation has reached a dead end. Not long ago, French Finance Minister Gaillard gloomily said, "We must go through a long tunnel before we can see the light."
    On June 24, the financial bill proposed by the Bourgès-Maunoury government passed in the National Assembly with a narrow majority of 251 votes to 210. Can this financial bill play a role in saving the financial crisis as the Bourgès-Maunoury government has announced? Parisian public opinion expresses doubt about this.
    Fiscal Deficit Difficult to Make Up
    Cutting budgets and increasing taxes are the main contents of the financial bill. The purpose of taking these measures is to make up for the current huge fiscal deficit.
    In recent years, France's fiscal deficit has been rising in a straight line. The deficit in 1955 was 800 billion francs, which increased to 1,057 billion francs in 1956, and is estimated to reach 1,200 billion to 1,500 billion francs in 1957. The continuous increase in the fiscal deficit is the evil consequence caused by expanding armaments and preparing for war and colonial wars. France's military expenditure was 1,056 billion francs in 1955, increased to 1,290 billion francs in 1956, and the 1957 budget reached 1,362 billion francs. Among them, the special military expenditure in Algeria was officially stipulated as 48 billion francs in 1955, jumped to 351 billion francs in 1956, and increased to 378 billion francs in 1957. In fact, in addition to the special military expenditure, a lot of expenses under the regular military expenditure and other items of the budget are also used for the Algerian war.
    French Finance Minister Gaillard admitted: "If the fiscal deficit exceeds 900 billion francs, it cannot be made up by the normal methods of the national treasury." In 1956, in order to make up for the deficit, the French government adopted the method of issuing public bonds. The number of public bonds issued in October 1956 reached 320 billion francs. But it is no longer possible to use this method this year. The sales of public bonds issued in March only reached 80 billion francs. Therefore, the French government was forced to seek help from the Bank of France. At the end of May, the Mollet government overdrafted 80 billion francs from the Bank of France to cope with the monthly expenses; at the end of June, the Bourgès-Maunoury government signed a protocol with the Bank of France to overdraft 350 billion francs (of which 50 billion francs were short-term loans).
    After all, overdrafting from banks is only a temporary emergency measure, and it will further promote malignant inflation. Therefore, the French government had to reduce the deficit by cutting budgets and increasing taxes.
    The Bourgès-Maunoury government fully accepted the Mollet government's plan to cut the budget by 250 billion francs. The original plan was to cut military expenditure by 100 billion, but because France bears the military obligations of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc and is also engaged in the increasingly costly Algerian war, only 66 billion was cut. The rest is mainly to reduce general civil expenditure and economic and social investment. However, more than 158 billion francs of military expenditure for the invasion of Egypt needs to be added to the 1957 budget, so the actual deficit can only be reduced by less than 100 billion francs.
    The newly added taxes are 147.5 billion francs in the second half of 1957, of which indirect taxes falling on the working people amount to 99 billion francs. In addition, the increase in the prices of postal and telephone services also increased the government's revenue by 23 billion francs.
    Obviously, the result of cutting budgets and increasing taxes will not reduce the fiscal deficit much. How to cope with the difficult situation of the national treasury depletion is still a serious problem facing the French government.
    Foreign Exchange Reserves Are About to Run Out
    Contracting imports and encouraging exports are another main content of the financial bill. The purpose of taking this measure is to solve the crisis of France's international balance of payments.
    In 1956, France's foreign trade situation deteriorated sharply, and the trade deficit with foreign countries that needed to be paid in foreign exchange reached 414 billion francs, almost reaching the highest level after the war; in 1957, the trade deficit with foreign countries continued to increase, reaching 221 billion francs in the first four months alone. One of the important reasons for the deterioration of the foreign trade situation is that the Algerian war has expanded the import of military materials. In 1955, France hardly imported any military materials, but in 1956, it imported 60 billion francs of military materials, and in 1957, it will import 90 billion francs. At the same time, the Algerian war has diverted a large part of the products to military needs, affecting the growth of exports. In 1956, military consumption was 430 billion francs, of which the products of the electrical and mechanical departments with the most export competitiveness accounted for 230 billion francs; in 1957, military expenditure consumption will reach 535.5 billion francs. In addition, due to the enlistment of miners, the import of American coal increased by about 50 million US dollars (about 17.5 billion francs) per year.
    The surge in the foreign trade deficit has made France's foreign exchange reserve situation increasingly tense. France not only used up the foreign exchange left over from the end of last year, but also used the 262.2 million US dollars it extracted from the International Monetary Fund last year, the 100 million US dollars of oil loans from American private banks at the end of February, and the 33 million US dollars of loans from the US government to France for purchasing cotton and other surplus agricultural products. Recently, the Bourgès-Maunoury government has also used 100 billion francs of the Bank of France's not-so-rich gold reserves and loaned 50 million US dollars to the European Payments Union, but the foreign exchange reserves are still extremely limited, and after paying off the deficit of more than 100 million US dollars in the European Payments Union in June, the remaining amount can only be maintained for less than three months.
    In this difficult situation, on June 18, the French government announced the re-imposition of quotas on imports from member states of the European Economic Cooperation Administration and the dollar area, intending to reduce total imports from the average of 150 billion francs per month in recent months to 100 billion francs per month. At the same time, it was decided to encourage exports by means of export subsidies, preferential tax rates, and priority supply, intending to increase the export value from 100 billion to 130 billion francs per month. However, after this measure was implemented, although the import of fuel and food decreased somewhat, the import of textile raw materials, precious metals, and non-ferrous metals increased. The reason is very simple. France's production depends on imported raw materials. According to Mendès-France's estimate, every 5% increase in production requires a corresponding increase of 100 billion to 130 billion francs in the import of raw materials and fuels. Therefore, the possibility of improving foreign trade is very limited. Bourgès-Maunoury pessimistically admitted in a speech in late July that France's trade deficit situation was "very dangerous" and that even "the boldest measures cannot guarantee an immediate change in this situation."
    Begging for Foreign Aid is Not Easy
    The French government also knows that the "financial bill" it proposed will not have a great effect. Therefore, Finance Minister Gaillard said, "We must borrow from allies to avoid serious difficulties."
    However, the United States, which has always adopted the attitude of a "patron," seems not to be "generous" this time. Needless to say, Uncle Sam is waiting for the opportunity to put forward conditions, especially trying to get involved in the recently discovered Saharan oil resources and step up the expansion of its forces in French North Africa. France is also wary of this, so it turned to West Germany and proposed a loan of 1 billion marks (equivalent to 260 million US dollars). West German Deputy Prime Minister Blücher has announced his agreement to allocate a part of the surplus from the European Payments Union to lend to France. However, West Germany also put forward conditions and took the opportunity to put pressure on France on the issues of the "Common Market" and "Atomic Energy Alliance." No wonder the Paris "Le Monde" worriedly cried out, "West Germany will become the second America!"
    Relying on begging for foreign aid to quench thirst with poison, France's situation is really pathetic. However, as long as the French ruling group adheres to policies that violate the interests of the French nation and continues to carry out colonial wars in Algeria, France's financial situation will continue to wander in the "dark tunnel," which will have serious consequences for the entire French economy and will further weaken France's international position.

    踯躅在黑暗的隧道里
    ——法国的财政危机——
    张帆
    目前法国财政情况已经到了山穷水尽的地步。不久以前，法国财政部长盖伊阿曾经黯然地说：“我们必须走过一段漫长的隧道，然后才能见到光明。”
    6月24日，布歇—莫努里政府提出的财政法案在国民议会以二百五十一票对二百十票的微弱多数通过了。这个财政法案是否能够像布歇—莫努里政府所宣布的那样起挽救财政危机的作用呢？巴黎的舆论对这一点是表示怀疑的。
    财政赤字难以弥补
    削减预算，增加税收，这是财政法案的一个主要内容。采取这种措施的目的，是为了弥补当前庞大的财政赤字。
    几年来，法国的财政赤字一直在直线上升。1955年的赤字是八千亿法郎，1956年增加到一万零五百七十亿法郎，估计1957年将达一万二千亿到一万五千亿法郎。财政赤字不断增加，是扩军备战和殖民战争所引起的恶果。法国的军费支出，1955年为一万零五百六十亿法郎，1956年增为一万二千九百亿法郎，1957年预算达一万三千六百二十亿法郎。其中阿尔及利亚的特别军费，1955年官方的规定是四百八十亿法郎，1956年一跃而为三千五百一十亿法郎，1957年又增加到三千七百八十亿法郎。而实际上，除了特别军费以外，在常年军费和预算的其它项目下也有不少费用是用于阿尔及利亚战争的。
    法国财政部长盖伊阿承认：“财政赤字超过九千亿法郎，就不能用国库正常的办法加以弥补。”1956年，为了弥补赤字，法国政府采用了发行公债的办法。1956年10月发行的公债数字就达到三千二百亿法郎。但是今年再用这个办法已经不行了。3月份发行的公债推销额仅达八百亿法郎。因此，法国政府被迫向法兰西银行求助。5月底，摩勒政府向法兰西银行透支了八百亿法郎来应付当月开支；6月底，布歇—莫努里政府又同法兰西银行签订了透支三千五百亿法郎（其中有五百亿法郎是短期贷款）的议定书。
    向银行透支，毕竟只是一时应急之计，而且还会进一步促进通货恶性膨胀。于是，法国政府不得不用削减预算、增加税收的办法来缩减赤字。
    布歇—莫努里政府全盘接收了摩勒政府削减预算二千五百亿法郎的计划。军费原定削减一千亿，由于法国承担着北大西洋侵略集团的军事义务，同时又进行着耗费日增的阿尔及利亚战争，结果仅削减六百六十亿。其余部分主要是削减一般民用开支和经济、社会投资。但是，在1957年预算中还需要追加侵埃战争的军事开支一千五百八十亿法郎以上，所以实际上赤字只能减少不到一千亿法郎。
    新增的税收，1957年下半年为一千四百七十五亿法郎，其中落在劳动人民身上的间接税达九百九十亿法郎。此外，邮政、电话的提价，也使政府增加收入二百三十亿法郎。
    显然，削减预算和增加税收的结果，并不能使财政赤字减少多少。怎样应付国库枯竭的难局，仍然是摆在法国政府面前的一个严重问题。
    外汇储备行将枯竭
    收缩进口、鼓励出口，是财政法案的另一个主要内容。采取这个措施的目的，是为了解救法国国际收支的危机。
    1956年法国对外贸易情况急剧恶化，需以外汇支付的对外国的贸易逆差达四千一百四十亿法郎，几乎达到战后最高的水平；1957年对外国的贸易逆差又继续增加，仅头四个月即达二千二百一十亿法郎。对外贸易情况恶化的重要原因之一，是阿尔及利亚战争扩大了军事物资的进口。1955年法国几乎没有进口什么军事物资，1956年进口军事物资六百亿法郎，1957年进口将达九百亿法郎。同时，阿尔及利亚战争又使很大一部分产品移用于军事需要，影响了出口的增长。1956年军事消费四千三百亿法郎，其中最有出口竞争能力的电气、机械部门的产品占二千三百亿法郎；1957年军费消费将达五千三百五十亿法郎。此外，由于矿工应征入伍，增加美煤进口每年约五千万美元（约一百七十五亿法郎）。
    对外贸易逆差的激增，就使法国外汇储备的情况日趋紧张。法国不仅用尽了去年年底结存的外汇，而且还动用了去年从国际货币基金提取的两亿六千二百万美元、2月底美国私人银行一亿美元的石油贷款以及美国政府给予法国购买棉花等剩余农产品的货款三千三百万美元。最近，布歇—莫努里政府又动用了法兰西银行并不富裕的库存黄金一千亿法郎，并且向欧洲支付同盟贷款五千万美元，但是外汇储备仍然极其有限，在偿付6月份欧洲支付同盟中的亏欠一亿多美元后，剩下的维持不到三个月。
    在这种窘迫的情况下，6月18日法国政府宣布重新对欧洲经济合作局成员国和美元区的进口规定限额，打算把全部进口从最近几个月的平均每月一千五百亿法郎削减到每月一千亿法郎。同时，又决定用出口津贴、优惠税率、优先供应等办法鼓励出口，打算把出口值从每月一千亿增至一千三百亿法郎。但是，在这个措施实施以后，虽然燃料和粮食的进口减少了一些，纺织业原料、贵重金属和非铁金属的进口却有了增加。原因很简单，法国的生产依赖进口的原料，据孟戴斯—弗朗斯估计，生产每增加5％，即需要相应增加一千亿到一千三百亿法郎的原料和燃料的进口。因此，改善对外贸易的可能性是很有限的。布歇—莫努里在7月下旬的一次谈话里就悲观地承认，法国贸易逆差的情况“非常危险”，即使“最大胆的措施也不能保证立即改变这种局面”。
    乞求外援也非易事
    法国政府也知道自己提出的“财政法案”并不会有很大的作用。因此财政部长盖伊阿说：“必须向盟国借款以避免严重的困难”。
    可是一向摆出“施主”姿态的美国，这回却显得并不“慷慨”。不用说山姆大叔是在等待时机提出条件，特别是企图染指最近发现的撒哈拉石油富源以及加紧扩张在法属北非的势力。法国对此也有戒心，因此它又转而求诸于西德，提出了借贷十亿马克（约合二亿六千万美元）的要求，西德副总理布吕希已宣布同意从欧洲支付同盟的盈余里拨出一部分借给法国。可是西德也提出了条件，并且借机就“共同市场”和“原子联营”问题向法国施加压力。无怪乎巴黎“世界报”担忧地叫唤道：“西德将会变成第二个美国！”
    靠乞求外援来饮鸩止渴，法国的处境也真是够可悲的了。然而，只要法国统治集团坚持违反法国民族利益的政策，继续在阿尔及利亚进行殖民战争，那么法国的财政情况就将长期踯躅在“黑暗的隧道”里，这将对整个法国经济产生严重的后果，并将进一步削弱法国的国际地位。
