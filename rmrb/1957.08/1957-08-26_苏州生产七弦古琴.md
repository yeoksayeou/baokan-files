　　Suzhou Produces Seven-Stringed Guqin
    The Guqin, also known as the seven-stringed zither, originated in the Zhou Dynasty three thousand years ago and is the oldest plucked string instrument in China. In order to inherit and promote the national heritage and meet the needs of classical music enthusiasts, the Suzhou Musical Instrument Factory began trial-producing this Guqin in the first half of this year. They use extremely dry cedar wood, rosewood, seashells, and black lacquer from a hundred years ago as raw materials to trial-produce various styles of Guqin from the Tang, Song, Ming, and Qing dynasties. The two Qing Dynasty-style Guqin that have now been trial-produced have been played by musicians and proven to have a loud volume and a soft and beautiful sound that meets the requirements.

　  苏州生产七弦古琴
    古琴又称七弦琴，产生于三千年前的周代，是中国最古老的一种弹弦乐器。为了继承和发扬民族遗产，满足爱好古典音乐者们的需要，苏州乐器厂于今年上半年开始试制这种古琴。他们采用一百年前的极干燥的杉木、红木、蚌壳和黑漆做原料，试制唐、宋、明、清等多种式样的古琴。现在已试制成的二只清朝式样的古琴，经音乐家们演奏，证明音量宏大，声音柔和优美，符合要求。
