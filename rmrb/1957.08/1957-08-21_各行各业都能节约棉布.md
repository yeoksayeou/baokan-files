All Industries and Professions Can Save Cotton Cloth

　　Tofu Industry: The Yueyang Chengguan Tofu Production Cooperative in Hunan Province used to replace the cloth for wrapping dried tofu and pressing thousand-layer tofu skin with new cloth whenever it was a little worn. This year, they decided to "replace new with old" to save good cloth. Now, the cooperative has sorted out more than 1,200 feet of used cloth. Cloth suitable for wrapping dried tofu is used for wrapping dried tofu, and cloth suitable for making soy milk straining cloth is sewn into soy milk straining cloth. From January to August this year, the cooperative originally planned to use 3,000 feet of cloth, but now only needs 1,440 feet, reducing expenditure by more than 250 yuan.

　　Traditional Chinese Medicine Industry: In the past, plasters sold by traditional Chinese medicine stores always had the medicinal膏藥膏药 pasted onto red cloth. In the past, for the sake of appearance, the plaster cloth was always several times larger than the small round plaster, and patients usually cut the cloth smaller and rounder when using it. Recently, the Jiang Yanze Traditional Chinese Medicine Store in Shanghai, in order to save cloth, reduced the size of each plaster cloth by one centimeter, which has no impact on the user.

　　Barbering Industry: The barbering industry in Dongkou County, Hunan Province, originally planned to make one gown for each of the twenty-five people this year, requiring a total of 115 feet of cloth. After calling for the conservation of cloth, all the workers held a forum and agreed that most gowns were damaged in the upper part, while the lower part was still good. Therefore, it was decided to cut off the upper part, replace it with new cloth, and continue to use the old lower part. Through the meticulous sewing of sewing workers, the gowns are still elegant and durable. As a result, only forty-five feet of cloth were used.

　　Hat-making Industry: There are also many tricks to cutting hats. Different methods, such as using straight or bias grain, cutting lines wide or narrow, close or spaced seams, have a great impact on saving raw materials. The Shanghai Hat-making Cooperative put its mind to this. For example, in the past, the brims of round or octagonal hats were cut at right angles or straight lines, but by changing to cross and bias grain cutting, 2.05 centimeters of cloth can be saved per dozen hats, without affecting the quality of the hats.

　　Sewing Industry: The Shanghai Garment Sewing Industry has saved 120,000 meters of cotton cloth from May to July by improving the layout method. In the past, due to the inadequate layout method, some scraps were always left over. At the beginning of the second quarter of this year, forty experienced technicians were drawn from various units to form seven professional groups, specializing in studying how to arrange the layout so that the scraps after cutting would be reduced. In more than three months, the professional groups produced more than 3,500 kinds of layout circles. After adopting the new layout method, an average of two meters of cloth is saved per dozen Zhongshan suits. In the past, an average of 30 meters of cloth was needed per dozen men's shirts, but now only 29.2 meters is needed.

　　Retail Stores: The Changchun Department Store No. 2 has saved a lot of cotton cloth by selling shirts based on body measurements. In the past, customers bought shirts based on estimates, and generally had the idea of "rather bigger than smaller," so large-size shirts sold particularly well. Now, the store's clothing team has implemented the method of selling shirts based on body measurements, using a tape measure to measure the customer's neck, body length, and sleeve length, and then giving the customer a shirt that fits. This not only guarantees a good fit, but also satisfies consumers. As a result, the sales of medium-sized shirts in the store have increased from 40% of total sales in the past to 60%. A large-size shirt uses half a foot more cloth than a medium-size shirt.　(Liu Xijiu)

### 各行各业都能节约棉布

　　各行各业都能节约棉布
    豆腐业　湖南岳阳城关豆作业生产合作社，以前包豆腐干、压千张皮的布，破旧一点，就要换新的；今年决定“整旧代新”节约好布。现在社里把一千二百多尺用过的旧布整理了一下，能包豆腐干的就包干子，能做摇浆布的就缝成摇浆布。该社今年1至8月，原计划用布三千尺，现在只用一千四百四十尺就够了，并减少开支二百五十多元。
    国药业　国药业卖的膏药，过去一向是将药膏粘在红布上的。以往为了外表好看，尽管药膏只一小圆块，但膏药布总是大好几倍，病人用时大都把布剪小剪圆。最近上海姜衍泽国药店，为了节约用布，把每张膏药布缩小一公分，对用者毫无影响。
    理发业　湖南洞口县理发业，原计划今年二十五个人，每人做围布一条，共需布一百十五尺。号召节约用布后，全体工人开了一次座谈会，认为一般围布多是上半节烂了，下半节还好，于是决定把上半节剪掉，换上新布，下半节仍用旧的，通过缝纫工人精工缝制，围布仍然雅观，照样耐用。结果只用去了四十五尺布。
    制帽业　帽子的剪裁也有很多窍门，一般布帽剪裁采用直丝或斜丝，切线宽或窄，密接或空接等不同的方法，对于节约原料有很大影响。上海市制帽合作社在这方面动了脑筋，例如，过去剪裁圆顶帽或八角帽的帽舌头，都采取直角或直线剪裁，但是改交叉及斜丝剪裁，每打帽子可省布二点零五公分，而且不影响帽子的质量。
    缝纫业　上海市服装缝纫业因为改进了排料方法，在5月到7月已节约棉布十二万公尺。过去由于排料方法不够好，总要剩一些碎料，今年二季度初，由各单位抽调了四十名有经验的技师，组成七个专业组，专门研究如何排料才能使裁剪后的碎料减少。三个多月来，专业组排出三千五百多种排样圆。采用新排料法后，平均每打中山服就节省二公尺布，过去男衬衫平均每打要用布三十公尺，现在只要二十九点二公尺就够了。
    零售店　长春市百货第二商店，实行量体卖衬衫，节约了不少棉布。过去顾客买衬衣都是估了买，一般都有“宁大勿小”的思想，因此大号衬衫销得特别多，现在该商店的服装小组，实行了量体卖衬衣的办法，用皮尺试量顾客领口、身长、袖长，然后拿合乎尺寸的衬衫给顾客，就不但保证合穿，消费者也满意。因此该店中号衬衫的销售，已由过去占总销量的40％，上升到60％。一件大号衬衣要比一件中号衬衣多用半尺布。　（刘锡九）
