Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 26th: The mystery of the treasure hidden by the Chinese in the depths of the Pamir Plateau over 300 years ago remains unsolved this year. Two attempts to enter the cave by the Soviet expedition led by Academician Tamm of the Soviet Academy of Sciences were unsuccessful. The expedition plans to continue the treasure hunt next year.

This Soviet expedition set off this year to explore for treasure in an area in the middle reaches of the Murghab River in the Pamir Plateau. The treasure is said to be hidden in a cave on a cliff high in a gorge two kilometers from Lake Rang Kul, a place difficult for humans to reach. According to legend, more than 300 years ago, a Chinese army came to this area to spend the winter. However, a heavy snow fell soon after, and the supply of food and fodder ran out, leaving both people and livestock in a desperate situation. These Chinese cut the horse carcasses into pieces, freezing the horse meat on the smooth rocks, and then climbed up to place the treasures they carried in the cave. However, they all died of starvation soon after. For many years, many people have tried to find these treasures, but none have succeeded. The purpose of this Soviet expedition was to uncover this mystery.

After arriving at the Rang Kul Gorge, the expedition first measured the height of the cliff where the treasure cave was located, discovering that the cliff was as high as 300 meters. On August 3rd, the expedition members attempted to climb from the foot of the mountain into the cave, but were forced to turn back halfway due to the inability to continue climbing. Later, the members decided to use iron ropes lowered from the top of the mountain to enter the cave. They lowered two people at the same time, one of whom was armed with weapons to defend against the sudden attacks of fierce eagles in the cave. After being lowered from the top of the mountain for 30 to 40 minutes, the two expedition members finally reached a protruding part near the entrance of the cave, but a sloping, weathered scree about 20 meters high blocked their way into the cave. The members tried various methods but could not enter the cave.

Since the members were exhausted and their vacation was over, the expedition decided to temporarily suspend the exploration and continue next year.

Some news about the treasure cave published in the Soviet newspapers and periodicals has aroused widespread interest among Soviet readers. Many people wrote to the editorial department of the "Spark" magazine, suggesting various methods to enter the cave, such as by helicopter or balloon.

### 帕米尔深山藏宝之谜未揭开　苏联探险队明年再接再厉

　  帕米尔深山藏宝之谜未揭开
　　苏联探险队明年再接再厉
    新华社莫斯科26日电　三百多年以前中国人在帕米尔高原深山藏宝之谜今年没有能够揭开，由苏联科学院院士塔姆率领的苏联探险队两次进洞的尝试都没有成功。探险队准备在明年继续探宝。
    这支苏联探险队是在今年出发到帕米尔高原穆尔加布河中游的一个地区去探宝的。藏宝的地方据说是距兰—库里湖两公里的一个峡谷内高处悬崖上的一个人类难于达到的山洞。据传说，三百多年前，一支中国部队来到了这个地区，准备在那里过冬，但是，不久天降大雪，粮秣用尽，人和牲口都陷入绝境。这些中国人就把马的尸体切成一块块，使马肉冻在平滑的岩石上，然后攀登上去把携带的财宝安置在山洞中的。但是，不久他们由于饥饿而全部死亡了。多少年来，有不少人曾经企图探寻这些财宝，可是都没有成功。这支苏联探险队的目的就想去揭破这个奥秘。
    探险队在到达兰—库里峡谷以后，首先测量了宝洞所在悬崖的高度，发现悬崖竟高达三百公尺。8月3日，探险队员作从山脚登高爬入山洞的尝试，结果因为无法继续攀登而中途折回。后来队员们又决定从山顶用铁索垂人下去的办法进入山洞。他们同时垂下两个人，其中一人手持武器，以防御突然来袭的洞中的凶鹰。从山顶下垂三、四十分钟以后，两名探险队员终于到达了洞口附近的凸出部分，但是有高约二十公尺的倾斜的风化碎石阻隔着进入山洞的去路，队员们采用各种办法都没能够进入洞内。
    由于队员们已经精疲力竭，而且假期也已经结束，探险队决定暂时停止这次探险，等到明年继续进行。
    苏联报刊发表的一些关于宝洞的消息引起了苏联读者的广泛兴趣，许多人写信给“星火”杂志编辑部，建议乘直升飞机或者气球等各种办法进入山洞。
