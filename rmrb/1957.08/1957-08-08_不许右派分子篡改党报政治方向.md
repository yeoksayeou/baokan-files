The *Xiamen Daily*

    Wu Shaling Wants to Start Another Newspaper

    (Reported by this newspaper) The *Xiamen Daily* recently exposed the anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks and conspiracies of Wu Shaling, the deputy director of the newspaper's editorial department. When the Party's rectification campaign began, Wu said, "In the past, the movement was always about Party members rectifying others; now it's time for Party members to taste what it's like to be rectified." He encouraged Cai Mingliang, a member of his clique, to spread anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks, and incited others to offer "sharp" opinions, saying that the old society was characterized by "officials protecting officials," while now it's "members protecting members." He also incited the masses in various ways, even going to the newspaper's factory workers to "mobilize" everyone to raise "sharp" opinions. He spoke to many people about tactics for attacking Party members, and hinted that they should concentrate their fire on Li Qi, the Party member and deputy editor-in-chief.

    Wu Shaling's rampant attacks on the Party were an attempt to seize the newspaper as a propaganda position. Wu had long conspired with Cai Mingliang to start an anti-Party and anti-socialist newspaper, and actively promoted the bourgeois right-wing view of running a newspaper. He was very pleased to see that Xu Zhucheng, the editor-in-chief of *Wenhui Bao*, had squeezed out the Party member leadership with his so-called "wall-demolishing" experience, saying, "Xu Zhucheng is right; the only skill of a Party member editor-in-chief is to change a coherent article into an incoherent one." When the *People's Daily*'s telegraphic report criticizing *Wenhui Bao* was issued, Wu said after seeing it: "This is dogmatism; it's not necessarily right."

    In order to change the direction of the *Xiamen Daily*, Wu Shaling repeatedly proposed bringing reporters and editors who had worked in reactionary newspapers in the past into the newspaper, and transferring out the League members and young people who had newly joined the news work. He mocked the Party member editors, saying they didn't know anything! They didn't understand how to run a newspaper at all.

    According to Cai Mingliang's confession, Wu and he had already considered the personnel arrangements for starting another newspaper. Wu would be the editor-in-chief, Cai would be the manager, and the editorial staff had also been arranged one by one. Even a counter-revolutionary element who had just completed his term in a labor camp was included. Cai had boasted that the newspaper they were running would have a "woodpecker" every day, publish Reuters and United Press dispatches every day, and crush the *Xiamen Daily* in half a year and the *Fujian Daily* in a year.

    Many people have revealed that Wu Shaling's anti-Party and anti-socialist sentiments have historical roots. Wu worked in reactionary newspapers for a long time before liberation, had close contacts with Kuomintang secret agents, and hated the Communist Party. In the early days of liberation, when he worked at the *Jiang Sheng Bao*, he gathered some people, formed a small clique, and attacked Party members, League members, and the trade union.

    After Wu Shaling's conspiracy was exposed, he tried every means to retreat, making false self-criticisms on the one hand and preventing others from "not talking about my affairs" on the other. His cunning denial aroused great indignation among all the staff, who unanimously expressed their determination to pursue him to the end until he thoroughly confessed and frankly admitted his guilt.

    *Shaanxi Daily*

    Wang Mengyuan Wants to Overthrow the Newspaper's Leadership

    (Reported by this newspaper) The editorial department of the *Shaanxi Daily* has held meetings for several days in a row to criticize Wang Mengyuan, a Party member editor of the newspaper, for his anti-Party and anti-people reactionary remarks. Since the right-wing elements rampantly attacked the Party, Wang Mengyuan colluded with some right-wing elements, attempting to overthrow the leadership of the newspaper. In order to realize this conspiracy, he distorted the facts, described the newspaper's Party organization and Party members as a complete mess, and said that the newspaper's leadership was not even as good as the feudal emperors Zhu Yuanzhang and Zhao Kuangyin. He fabricated rumors and sowed discord, saying "the work is done by the masses, the positions are held by Party members." He also slandered the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, incited key figures and criminal offenders in the newspaper's suppression of counter-revolutionaries to reverse their verdicts, and boasted that insurance "will be reversed one by one." He also encouraged those people, saying, "If you want to go to Beijing, I can pay for it." He also searched for people he thought could be used as ignition targets, incited them to post big-character posters, and exposed some confidential Party materials to those who were dissatisfied with the Party. In addition, he also encouraged right-wing elements such as Guan Yu and Chen Bunan within the newspaper to attack the Party, calling himself the "commander" of this group of right-wing elements. He claimed that he wanted to "completely defeat" the newspaper's four leading comrades, and incited those who were dissatisfied with the Party, saying, "The editor-in-chief is about to fall; do it!"

    *Chengdu Daily*

    Xiao Feng Wants to Tamper with the Direction of the Party Newspaper

    (Reported by this newspaper) Since mid-July, the *Chengdu Daily* has continuously published articles and held forums to expose and criticize the reactionary remarks of Xiao Feng (Huang Zerong), the editor of the newspaper's literary group and an amateur writer. In Xiao Feng's "A Letter to the Provincial Communist Youth League Committee" and the two sequels "Reporting to the Party" and "Going to Beijing," he launched covert attacks against the Party. He portrayed the state monopoly of purchase and marketing as "robbing the peasants of their grain" and "making men and women cry." He also publicly said that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in Chengdu was "seriously wrong" and viciously concluded "the suppression of counter-revolutionaries" with sixteen characters: "Dark and sunless, inhuman, destroying Party discipline, violating the constitution." He scolded Party organizations, Party members, and activists close to the Party as tyrants and philistines, while dressing himself up as a "leftist," claiming to be the "son of the working class" and a "straightforward youth who supports the Communist Party."

    Xiao Feng's reactionary ideas have been around for a long time. As early as 1953, Xiao Feng was in the company of right-wing elements such as Liu Shahe, Shi Tianhe, and Qian Zi. One night in January of this year, these right-wing elements gathered at Qian Zi's home to talk about private matters. Qian Zi said, "This place of ours is the Petőfi Club!" This group of people actively supported Liu Shahe, especially after Liu Shahe fabricated a "political frame-up incident." Xiao Feng immediately stood up and demanded that the *Sichuan Daily* and the *People's Daily* publish the full text of Liu Shahe's speech, otherwise they would not dare to boldly speak out. He attempted to turn the Party newspaper in the direction of the bourgeoisie.

    Readers in Chengdu have written letters to the *Chengdu Daily* to denounce Xiao Feng's reactionary remarks. At the denunciation meeting of people from all walks of life in Chengdu, suburban peasants used their own experiences to explain that the state monopoly of purchase and marketing guaranteed the supply of grain, and the peasants were all happy to sell their surplus grain. They also revealed that Xiao Feng spoke for the landlords during the land reform. He once told the landlords to sell less grain, and forcibly classified a landlord as a middle peasant.

    *Zhejiang Daily*, *Hangzhou Daily*

    Xu Qin and Wu Pengting Peddle Reactionary News Viewpoints

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Zhejiang Province and Hangzhou City news and publishing circles held a forum to continuously expose and refute the anti-Party remarks of Xu Qin, an editor of the *Zhejiang Daily*, and Wu Pengting, a reporter of the *Hangzhou Daily*.

    During the period of free airing of views, Xu Qin completely obliterated the great achievements made by the *Zhejiang Daily* under the leadership of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee in the past eight years, and vilified the *Zhejiang Daily* as a "bulletin board" of lengthy instructions and notices, clamoring that the newspaper should maintain "independence and initiative" and "should not follow the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee." Xu Qin's whole set of arguments that the Provincial Party Committee was an amateur in leading the newspaper was in line with the right-wing remarks across the country. Xu Qin believed that only "old newspapermen" had the "talent" to run a newspaper, and that cadres who had worked in the people's news industry in the liberated areas for more than ten years were "not up to the level." He also absurdly advocated that editors and reporters should be able to freely publish their articles in the newspaper without the consent of the editor-in-chief. The meeting also revealed that Xu Qin had written many reactionary articles for the reactionary "*Tianxing Bao*" before liberation. After liberation, he consistently despised the Party's news work, and said that Party member editors and reporters were worthless.

    Wu Pengting, a reporter for the *Hangzhou Daily* and a special reporter for the *Wenhui Bao*, firmly supported the bourgeois direction of the *Wenhui Bao* for a period of time, becoming a stronghold of the *Wenhui Bao* in Hangzhou. He wrote many inflammatory and viciously attacking reports on the Party, and peddled bourgeois news viewpoints within the *Hangzhou Daily*, delighting in the reactionary newspaper policy of *Wenhui Bao* of "taking what others discard and discarding what others take," using this to resist the policy of the Party newspaper, and sowing discord between comrades and leading cadres of the *Hangzhou Daily*, attempting to destroy the Party newspaper ideologically and organizationally. These anti-Party remarks were severely criticized at the meeting.

    Reader Asks:

    Where Does the *Sichuan Workers' Daily* Want to Lead the Workers?

    (Reported by this newspaper) The *Sichuan Daily* recently published articles and letters from readers questioning the reporting direction of the *Sichuan Workers' Daily* in the current anti-rightist struggle. An article signed Qingsheng pointed out: Opening up the *Sichuan Workers' Daily* during this period, the pages are not filled with the voices and actions of workers and masses denouncing right-wing elements, but with a large number of reports on love killings and seduction cases such as "Her Death" and "The Child Corpse Case." This is puzzling: Where exactly does the *Sichuan Workers' Daily* want to lead readers in this sharp class struggle?

    From June 9, when the newspaper reprinted the *People's Daily* editorial "What is the Reason for This?" to June 25, for half a month, apart from sporadically reporting some news of workers opposing right-wing elements, there was no article refuting the arguments of the right-wing elements. After the publication of the *People's Daily* editorial "Workers Speak Out," the *Sichuan Workers' Daily*, as a workers' newspaper, placed it on the fourth page, while the first page of the day was devoted to the visit of the Japanese Sports Association delegation to Chongqing and some news that was not very time-sensitive. The title of the editorial was far less large and eye-catching than the title of the love killing case "Her Death." Furthermore, from June 20 to 27, the newspaper published a total of twenty reports related to the anti-rightist struggle on all pages, of which the reprints of the Xinhua News Agency's manuscripts and some brief news of right-wing remarks accounted for the majority. However, during the same period, the newspaper published eighteen social news stories like "Her Death" and "Chengdu Sika Deer Give Birth to Expensive Babies Every Year" as well as fourteen so-called social problem answers to "Can You Make Friends with Married Female Comrades?" in the first and second pages alone. Such one-sided pursuit of "interest" undoubtedly weakened the reporting of the current major struggle task.

    Under what kind of ideological guidance is the *Sichuan Workers' Daily* run? The root cause can be found in a speech given by Wang Gang (Director of the Editorial Office), one of the main responsible persons of the newspaper, at a forum of news and literary figures convened by the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. Wang Gang believed that the reason why newspapers are not well-run today is the lack of free competition. He advocated that "with the exception of the *People's Daily*, the Party newspapers of all provinces and cities should be abolished and replaced by 'mass newspapers' and 'cooperative newspapers.'" He believed that whether a newspaper is well-run should be determined by how well it sells. He believed that in today's situation, the Party spirit and guiding principles of newspapers are no longer applicable. These fallacies have been criticized from all sides.

    不许右派分子篡改党报政治方向
    厦门日报
    吴沙零要另办一个报纸
    本报讯　厦门日报最近揭发了该报编辑部副主任吴沙零的反党反社会主义的言论和阴谋活动。党的整风开始时，吴就说：“过去运动都是党员整别人，现在叫党员尝尝挨整的滋味”。鼓动他的小集团成员蔡明良散布反党反社会主义言论，唆使别人提意见要“尖锐”。说旧社会是“官官相护”，现在是“员员相护”。他在群众中也多方煽动，甚至到报社工厂工人中去“动员”大家提“尖锐”意见。他对许多人谈到打击党员的策略，并暗示要集中火力打击党员副总编辑李齐。
    吴沙零这样猖狂向党进攻，是企图夺取报纸这个宣传阵地。吴早就与蔡明良合谋过，要办个反党反社会主义的报纸，并积极宣传资产阶级右派的办报观点。他看到文汇报总编辑徐铸成排挤党员领导的所谓“拆墙”经验，非常高兴，说：“徐铸成说得对，党员总编辑唯一的本领就是把通的文章，改成不通的”。在人民日报对文汇报提出批评的电讯稿发来时，吴看到说：这是教条主义，不一定对。
    吴沙零为改变厦门日报的方向，曾一再提出要把过去在反动报社工作过的记者编辑，拉进报社来，把新参加新闻工作的团员和青年调出去。他嘲骂党员编辑，说他们懂得个屁！他们根本不懂办报。
    据蔡明良交代，吴和他筹划另办一个报纸已考虑好了人事安排，由吴当总编辑，蔡当经理，编辑部人员也一一作过安排。一个劳改期刚满的反革命分子也安排在内。蔡曾扬言，他们办的报纸将要天天有“啄木鸟”，天天刊登路透社、合众社的消息，要半年挤垮厦门日报。一年挤垮福建日报。
    许多人揭发，吴沙零反党、反社会主义是有历史根源的。吴解放前长期在反动报社工作，与国民党特务往来密切，仇视共产党。解放初，他在江声报工作时，就拉拢一些人，搞小集团，打击党团员，打击工会。
    吴沙零的阴谋被揭发后，就千方百计设法退却，一面作假检讨，一面阻止别人“不要把我的事情讲出去”。他这样狡猾抵赖，引起全体职工们极大愤慨，一致表示要追击到底，直到他彻底交代、坦白认罪为止。
    ＊陕西日报＊
    王萌元要推翻报社领导
    本报讯　陕西日报编辑部连日召开会议，批判该报党员编辑王萌元的反党反人民的反动言行。王萌元从右派分子猖狂向党进攻时，就和一些右派分子勾结在一起，企图推翻报社的领导。为了实现这个阴谋，他歪曲事实，把报社党组织和党员说成一团糟，说报社领导还不如封建皇帝朱元璋、赵匡胤。他造谣挑拨说“活是群众干，官是党员当”。他还污蔑肃反，煽动报社里肃反中的重点分子和刑事犯罪分子翻案，并吹嘘说保险“翻一个准一个”，他还鼓动那些人说“如果要上北京，我可以出钱”。他又找遍了他认为可作为点火对象的人，煽动他们贴大字报，并把党内一些机密材料暴露给那些对党心怀不满的人，除此，他还鼓动报社内部的右派分子关愚、陈布南等向党进攻，自称为这伙右派分子的“主帅”。他声称要把报社的四个领导同志“彻底打垮”，并煽动那些对党心怀不满的人说：“总编辑快倒下了，你们干吧！”
    ＊成都日报＊
    晓枫要篡改党报方向
    本报讯　7月中旬以来，成都日报连续发表文章和举行座谈会，揭露批判该报文艺组编辑、业余文艺作者晓枫（黄泽荣）的反动言行。在晓枫写的“给团省委的一封信”和“向党反映”、“上北京”两个续篇中，发出了向党进攻的暗箭。他把统购统销描绘成“抢农民的粮食”、“弄得男男女女哭哭啼啼”。他还公开说，成都市的肃反“错误是严重的”，并恶毒地给“肃反”下了十六个字的结论：“暗无天日，惨无人道，破坏党纪，违反宪法”。他骂党组织、党员和靠近党的积极分子是暴君、市侩，却把自己打扮成一个“左派”，自称是“工人阶级的儿子”、“拥护共产党的正直青年”。
    晓枫的反动思想是由来已久的。早在1953年，晓枫就与流沙河、石天河、茜子等右派分子为伍。今年1月的一个晚上，这几个右派分子就曾聚集在茜子家里谈私房话，茜子说：“我们这里就是裴多菲俱乐部！”这伙人积极支持流沙河，特别在流沙河捏造的“政治陷害事件”的谈话以后，晓枫立刻站出来，要求四川日报和人民日报全文刊载流沙河的谈话，否则就是不敢大胆鸣放。企图把党报转向资产阶级的方向。
    成都的读者纷纷写信给成都日报，斥责晓枫的反动言论。在成都市各界人士的声讨会上，郊区农民用亲身的经历，说明统购统销保证了粮食供应，农民都是欢天喜地卖余粮的。他们还揭露晓枫在土地改革中，替地主说话。他曾叫地主少卖粮食，硬把一个地主划为中农成份。
    ＊浙江日报、杭州日报＊
    徐勤、乌鹏廷贩卖反动新闻观点
    本报讯　浙江省、杭州市新闻出版界座谈会，连续揭发并驳斥浙江日报编辑徐勤和杭州日报记者乌鹏廷的反党言行。
    徐勤在鸣放期间，一笔抹杀了浙江日报在浙江省委领导下八年来所取得的巨大成绩，把浙江日报污蔑为连篇累牍的指示和通知的“布告牌”，叫嚣报纸应该保持“独立性和主动性”，“不应该跟着省委领导跑”。徐勤这一整套省委对报纸领导外行的论调，是和全国的右派言论一脉相承的。徐勤认为“老报人”才有办报“才能”，认为在解放区干过十多年人民新闻事业的干部是“没有水平的”。还荒谬地主张编辑、记者的文章不必要总编辑同意，就可以在报上自由发表。会上并揭露徐勤在解放前，就为反动的“天行报”写过许多反动文章，解放后，他一贯藐视党的新闻事业，把党员编辑、记者说的一钱不值。
    杭州日报记者、文汇报特约记者乌鹏廷，坚决支持文汇报在一个时期内的资产阶级方向，成为文汇报在杭州的据点，他写过许多带煽动性的和恶毒攻击党的报道，并在杭州日报内部贩卖资产阶级新闻观点，津津乐道文汇报“人舍我取，人取我舍”的反动办报方针，以此与党报的方针相抗衡，并挑拨杭州日报同志和领导干部的关系，企图从思想上组织上搞垮党报。会上严厉斥责了这些反党言行。
    读者质问：
    四川工人日报要把工人引向哪里去？
    本报讯　四川日报最近发表文章和读者来信，对四川工人日报在这一时期反右派斗争中的报道方向提出质疑。署名庆生的文章指出：打开这一时期的四川工人日报，充满篇幅的不是职工群众痛斥右派分子的声音和行动，而是大量的诸如“她的死”、“童尸案”一类的情杀、诱奸案的报道。这就令人不解：四川工人日报在这场尖锐的阶级斗争中究竟要把读者引导到那里去？
    从该报6月9日转载人民日报社论“这是为什么？”开始到6月25日这半个月来的报纸，除了若断若续地报道一些工人反右派的消息以外，就再也找不出一篇工人反驳右派言论的文章。人民日报社论“工人说话了”发表以后，作为工人报纸的四川工人日报却把它排在第四版，而当天一版刊登的却是日本体育协会代表团访问重庆以及一些时间性不大的新闻。社论的标题远不如“她的死”这件情杀案的标题来得大而醒目。再从6月20日到27日的该报来看，全部版面共刊载了二十条有关反右派的报道，其中转发新华社的稿件和一些右派言论的简闻就占了一大半。但在同期，该报仅在一、二两版就登载了十八条像“她的死”那样的社会新闻和“成都梅花鹿年年生贵子”之类的花边新闻以及“能和已婚的女同志交朋友吗？”这些所谓社会问题解答十四则。像这样的一味追求“趣味”，无疑就削弱了对当前主要斗争任务的报道。
    四川工人日报是在一种什么思想指导下办报？可以从该报主要负责人之一汪岗（总编辑室主任）在中共重庆市委召开的新闻、文艺界人士座谈会上的一席发言中找到根源。汪岗认为：报纸今天办得不好的原因是没有自由竞争，他主张“除人民日报外，各省市的党报应当一律取消，而以‘群众报’‘同人报’来代替”。他认为报纸办得好坏，一切应以销路如何来决定。他认为在今天情况下，报纸的党性、指导性原则已经不再适用了。这些谬论已受到各方面的批判。
