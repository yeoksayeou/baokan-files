The *Xiamen Daily*

    Wu Shaling Wants to Start Another Newspaper

    (Reported by this newspaper) The *Xiamen Daily* recently exposed the anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks and conspiracies of Wu Shaling, the deputy director of the newspaper's editorial department. When the Party's rectification campaign began, Wu said, "In the past, the movement was always about Party members rectifying others; now it's time for Party members to taste what it's like to be rectified." He encouraged Cai Mingliang, a member of his clique, to spread anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks, and incited others to offer "sharp" opinions, saying that the old society was characterized by "officials protecting officials," while now it's "members protecting members." He also incited the masses in various ways, even going to the newspaper's factory workers to "mobilize" everyone to raise "sharp" opinions. He spoke to many people about tactics for attacking Party members, and hinted that they should concentrate their fire on Li Qi, the Party member and deputy editor-in-chief.

    Wu Shaling's rampant attacks on the Party were an attempt to seize the newspaper as a propaganda position. Wu had long conspired with Cai Mingliang to start an anti-Party and anti-socialist newspaper, and actively promoted the bourgeois right-wing view of running a newspaper. He was very pleased to see that Xu Zhucheng, the editor-in-chief of *Wenhui Bao*, had squeezed out the Party member leadership with his so-called "wall-demolishing" experience, saying, "Xu Zhucheng is right; the only skill of a Party member editor-in-chief is to change a coherent article into an incoherent one." When the *People's Daily*'s telegraphic report criticizing *Wenhui Bao* was issued, Wu said after seeing it: "This is dogmatism; it's not necessarily right."

    In order to change the direction of the *Xiamen Daily*, Wu Shaling repeatedly proposed bringing reporters and editors who had worked in reactionary newspapers in the past into the newspaper, and transferring out the League members and young people who had newly joined the news work. He mocked the Party member editors, saying they didn't know anything! They didn't understand how to run a newspaper at all.

    According to Cai Mingliang's confession, Wu and he had already considered the personnel arrangements for starting another newspaper. Wu would be the editor-in-chief, Cai would be the manager, and the editorial staff had also been arranged one by one. Even a counter-revolutionary element who had just completed his term in a labor camp was included. Cai had boasted that the newspaper they were running would have a "woodpecker" every day, publish Reuters and United Press dispatches every day, and crush the *Xiamen Daily* in half a year and the *Fujian Daily* in a year.

    Many people have revealed that Wu Shaling's anti-Party and anti-socialist sentiments have historical roots. Wu worked in reactionary newspapers for a long time before liberation, had close contacts with Kuomintang secret agents, and hated the Communist Party. In the early days of liberation, when he worked at the *Jiang Sheng Bao*, he gathered some people, formed a small clique, and attacked Party members, League members, and the trade union.

    After Wu Shaling's conspiracy was exposed, he tried every means to retreat, making false self-criticisms on the one hand and preventing others from "not talking about my affairs" on the other. His cunning denial aroused great indignation among all the staff, who unanimously expressed their determination to pursue him to the end until he thoroughly confessed and frankly admitted his guilt.

    *Shaanxi Daily*

    Wang Mengyuan Wants to Overthrow the Newspaper's Leadership

    (Reported by this newspaper) The editorial department of the *Shaanxi Daily* has held meetings for several days in a row to criticize Wang Mengyuan, a Party member editor of the newspaper, for his anti-Party and anti-people reactionary remarks. Since the right-wing elements rampantly attacked the Party, Wang Mengyuan colluded with some right-wing elements, attempting to overthrow the leadership of the newspaper. In order to realize this conspiracy, he distorted the facts, described the newspaper's Party organization and Party members as a complete mess, and said that the newspaper's leadership was not even as good as the feudal emperors Zhu Yuanzhang and Zhao Kuangyin. He fabricated rumors and sowed discord, saying "the work is done by the masses, the positions are held by Party members." He also slandered the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, incited key figures and criminal offenders in the newspaper's suppression of counter-revolutionaries to reverse their verdicts, and boasted that insurance "will be reversed one by one." He also encouraged those people, saying, "If you want to go to Beijing, I can pay for it." He also searched for people he thought could be used as ignition targets, incited them to post big-character posters, and exposed some confidential Party materials to those who were dissatisfied with the Party. In addition, he also encouraged right-wing elements such as Guan Yu and Chen Bunan within the newspaper to attack the Party, calling himself the "commander" of this group of right-wing elements. He claimed that he wanted to "completely defeat" the newspaper's four leading comrades, and incited those who were dissatisfied with the Party, saying, "The editor-in-chief is about to fall; do it!"

    *Chengdu Daily*

    Xiao Feng Wants to Tamper with the Direction of the Party Newspaper

    (Reported by this newspaper) Since mid-July, the *Chengdu Daily* has continuously published articles and held forums to expose and criticize the reactionary remarks of Xiao Feng (Huang Zerong), the editor of the newspaper's literary group and an amateur writer. In Xiao Feng's "A Letter to the Provincial Communist Youth League Committee" and the two sequels "Reporting to the Party" and "Going to Beijing," he launched covert attacks against the Party. He portrayed the state monopoly of purchase and marketing as "robbing the peasants of their grain" and "making men and women cry." He also publicly said that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in Chengdu was "seriously wrong" and viciously concluded "the suppression of counter-revolutionaries" with sixteen characters: "Dark and sunless, inhuman, destroying Party discipline, violating the constitution." He scolded Party organizations, Party members, and activists close to the Party as tyrants and philistines, while dressing himself up as a "leftist," claiming to be the "son of the working class" and a "straightforward youth who supports the Communist Party."

    Xiao Feng's reactionary ideas have been around for a long time. As early as 1953, Xiao Feng was in the company of right-wing elements such as Liu Shahe, Shi Tianhe, and Qian Zi. One night in January of this year, these right-wing elements gathered at Qian Zi's home to talk about private matters. Qian Zi said, "This place of ours is the Pet≈ëfi Club!" This group of people actively supported Liu Shahe, especially after Liu Shahe fabricated a "political frame-up incident." Xiao Feng immediately stood up and demanded that the *Sichuan Daily* and the *People's Daily* publish the full text of Liu Shahe's speech, otherwise they would not dare to boldly speak out. He attempted to turn the Party newspaper in the direction of the bourgeoisie.

    Readers in Chengdu have written letters to the *Chengdu Daily* to denounce Xiao Feng's reactionary remarks. At the denunciation meeting of people from all walks of life in Chengdu, suburban peasants used their own experiences to explain that the state monopoly of purchase and marketing guaranteed the supply of grain, and the peasants were all happy to sell their surplus grain. They also revealed that Xiao Feng spoke for the landlords during the land reform. He once told the landlords to sell less grain, and forcibly classified a landlord as a middle peasant.

    *Zhejiang Daily*, *Hangzhou Daily*

    Xu Qin and Wu Pengting Peddle Reactionary News Viewpoints

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Zhejiang Province and Hangzhou City news and publishing circles held a forum to continuously expose and refute the anti-Party remarks of Xu Qin, an editor of the *Zhejiang Daily*, and Wu Pengting, a reporter of the *Hangzhou Daily*.

    During the period of free airing of views, Xu Qin completely obliterated the great achievements made by the *Zhejiang Daily* under the leadership of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee in the past eight years, and vilified the *Zhejiang Daily* as a "bulletin board" of lengthy instructions and notices, clamoring that the newspaper should maintain "independence and initiative" and "should not follow the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee." Xu Qin's whole set of arguments that the Provincial Party Committee was an amateur in leading the newspaper was in line with the right-wing remarks across the country. Xu Qin believed that only "old newspapermen" had the "talent" to run a newspaper, and that cadres who had worked in the people's news industry in the liberated areas for more than ten years were "not up to the level." He also absurdly advocated that editors and reporters should be able to freely publish their articles in the newspaper without the consent of the editor-in-chief. The meeting also revealed that Xu Qin had written many reactionary articles for the reactionary "*Tianxing Bao*" before liberation. After liberation, he consistently despised the Party's news work, and said that Party member editors and reporters were worthless.

    Wu Pengting, a reporter for the *Hangzhou Daily* and a special reporter for the *Wenhui Bao*, firmly supported the bourgeois direction of the *Wenhui Bao* for a period of time, becoming a stronghold of the *Wenhui Bao* in Hangzhou. He wrote many inflammatory and viciously attacking reports on the Party, and peddled bourgeois news viewpoints within the *Hangzhou Daily*, delighting in the reactionary newspaper policy of *Wenhui Bao* of "taking what others discard and discarding what others take," using this to resist the policy of the Party newspaper, and sowing discord between comrades and leading cadres of the *Hangzhou Daily*, attempting to destroy the Party newspaper ideologically and organizationally. These anti-Party remarks were severely criticized at the meeting.

    Reader Asks:

    Where Does the *Sichuan Workers' Daily* Want to Lead the Workers?

    (Reported by this newspaper) The *Sichuan Daily* recently published articles and letters from readers questioning the reporting direction of the *Sichuan Workers' Daily* in the current anti-rightist struggle. An article signed Qingsheng pointed out: Opening up the *Sichuan Workers' Daily* during this period, the pages are not filled with the voices and actions of workers and masses denouncing right-wing elements, but with a large number of reports on love killings and seduction cases such as "Her Death" and "The Child Corpse Case." This is puzzling: Where exactly does the *Sichuan Workers' Daily* want to lead readers in this sharp class struggle?

    From June 9, when the newspaper reprinted the *People's Daily* editorial "What is the Reason for This?" to June 25, for half a month, apart from sporadically reporting some news of workers opposing right-wing elements, there was no article refuting the arguments of the right-wing elements. After the publication of the *People's Daily* editorial "Workers Speak Out," the *Sichuan Workers' Daily*, as a workers' newspaper, placed it on the fourth page, while the first page of the day was devoted to the visit of the Japanese Sports Association delegation to Chongqing and some news that was not very time-sensitive. The title of the editorial was far less large and eye-catching than the title of the love killing case "Her Death." Furthermore, from June 20 to 27, the newspaper published a total of twenty reports related to the anti-rightist struggle on all pages, of which the reprints of the Xinhua News Agency's manuscripts and some brief news of right-wing remarks accounted for the majority. However, during the same period, the newspaper published eighteen social news stories like "Her Death" and "Chengdu Sika Deer Give Birth to Expensive Babies Every Year" as well as fourteen so-called social problem answers to "Can You Make Friends with Married Female Comrades?" in the first and second pages alone. Such one-sided pursuit of "interest" undoubtedly weakened the reporting of the current major struggle task.

    Under what kind of ideological guidance is the *Sichuan Workers' Daily* run? The root cause can be found in a speech given by Wang Gang (Director of the Editorial Office), one of the main responsible persons of the newspaper, at a forum of news and literary figures convened by the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. Wang Gang believed that the reason why newspapers are not well-run today is the lack of free competition. He advocated that "with the exception of the *People's Daily*, the Party newspapers of all provinces and cities should be abolished and replaced by 'mass newspapers' and 'cooperative newspapers.'" He believed that whether a newspaper is well-run should be determined by how well it sells. He believed that in today's situation, the Party spirit and guiding principles of newspapers are no longer applicable. These fallacies have been criticized from all sides.
