    The Leadership of the China Democratic League's Anhui Provincial Committee
    Falls into the Hands of the Rightist Clique
    (Our Newspaper dispatch) The Anhui Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League has exposed a rightist clique that controlled the provincial committee of the League and engaged in anti-Party activities. The core figures of this group are Tong Chewu, the Minister of Propaganda of the Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, Wang Jinzhai, the Deputy Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee, and Wu Bomin, the Minister of Organization.

    When Tong Chewu propagated the Party's policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," he did not talk at all about how the democratic parties could coexist with the Party, but only talked about supervising the Party. When talking about the policy toward intellectuals, he only emphasized unity, and rarely talked about or did not talk about education and transformation. He one-sidedly emphasized that the China Democratic League represents the interests of intellectuals, saying that the China Democratic League would support them when there were problems, asking them to "seek justice" and "vent their anger." Wu Bomin and others seized the leadership of the League organizations at all levels in the development of organizations and personnel arrangements. Many people have exposed that the lists of the China Democratic League's Huainan, Hefei, and Bengbu Municipal Committees that they proposed were to place right-wing elements in leading positions. Under Wu Bomin's erroneous policy of "promoting development with development," many people who were dissatisfied with the Party and had political problems were absorbed into the League.

    They used the standing committee meeting of the China Democratic League Provincial Committee to plan before the meeting, and put forward their own proposals at the meeting to pass them. Therefore, they have actually seized the leadership of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League.

### 民盟安徽省委的领导权  落在右派集团的手中

    民盟安徽省委的领导权
    落在右派集团的手中
    本报讯　民盟安徽省委揭发了一个把持民盟省委、进行反党活动的右派集团。这个集团的核心人物是民盟省委的宣传部长童车五、文教委员会副主任王晋斋、组织部长吴伯敏。
    童车五在宣传党的“长期共存，互相监督”方针时，根本不谈民主党派怎样才能和党共存，而是只谈对党的监督。谈到对知识分子的政策时，他只宣传团结，不谈或少谈教育改造。他片面强调民盟代表知识分子利益，说有问题时民盟给他们撑腰，要他们“伸冤”、“泄愤”。吴伯敏等在发展组织和人事安排上，夺取各级盟组织的领导权。许多人揭发了他们提出的民盟淮南、合肥、蚌埠市委的名单，是要把右派分子安插到领导岗位上。在吴伯敏“以发展推动发展”的错误方针下，吸收了许多对党不满、有政治问题的人入盟。
    他们利用民盟省委的常委碰头会，在会前策划，开会时提出自己的主张来通过，所以他们实际上已夺取了安徽民盟省委的领导权。
