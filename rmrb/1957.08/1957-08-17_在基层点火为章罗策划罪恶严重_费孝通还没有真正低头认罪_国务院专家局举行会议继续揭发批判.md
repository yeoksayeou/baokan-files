Xinhua News Agency, August 16th: The State Council Expert Bureau held its second meeting on August 7th to expose and criticize rightist Fei Xiaotong.

At the meeting, Fei Xiaotong's conspiracy to attack the Communist Party on the issue of intellectuals was first exposed. According to the exposure, Fei Xiaotong negated the achievements of the Communist Party's work on intellectuals, exaggerated the shortcomings; distorted the Communist Party's policy on intellectuals, resisted ideological reform; and planned to write articles such as "Early Spring Weather for Intellectuals," attempting to gradually seize the Communist Party's leadership over intellectuals. Comrades who worked with Fei Xiaotong in the Southwest last year exposed Fei Xiaotong's heinous activities in Chengdu, Kunming, and other places last year. In August of last year, Fei Xiaotong, in his capacity as Deputy Director of the Expert Bureau, went to the Southwest under the guise of "understanding the work of intellectuals." He prepared in advance an investigation outline specifically designed to collect anti-Party materials. After arriving in Chengdu and Kunming, he convened small forums of intellectuals in the name of the China Democratic League. According to investigations, among those who participated in the two forums, fifteen rightists were recently reported in the newspapers, including seven in Chengdu and eight in Kunming. The two forums were actually "mobilization meetings" for them to attack the Communist Party, and Fei Xiaotong sowed "seeds of fire" at the forums. He maliciously used phrases like "the mountains are high and the land is far in the Southwest, and the wind blows slowly," Southwestern universities only "obey the law and follow the wind," "there are too few first and second-level professors in the Southwest," "unfair evaluation," and said that members of the China Democratic League in the Southwest are "wooden people," "don't use their brains," and are "absolutely obedient," maliciously inciting rightists to attack the Communist Party and attempting to confuse some people with unclear understanding. When Fei Xiaotong was in Chengdu, he patted his chest and said, "I, Fei Xiaotong, am here to solve problems, otherwise I will have no face to come to Sichuan again." He also said: "I, Fei Xiaotong, will not obey the law. The Ministry of Higher Education wanted our Nationalities Institute to formulate a scientific research plan, and I rejected it with one phone call." He also said: "The Ministry of Health held a medical education conference in Beijing, and some League member representatives reflected their opinions to the League headquarters. The League headquarters notified the Ministry of Health, and as a result, the original meeting was canceled." (After investigation, neither of the above two incidents are factual.) He supported the rightists, mobilized them to "lift the lid" and fight for "democracy and freedom." After the forums, Fei Xiaotong also took the method of mutual collusion to further organize the forces of the rightists. In Kunming, he discovered loopholes in the performing arts circles and also lit a "fire."

Fei Xiaotong's two rural surveys, "Revisiting Jiang Village," which attempted to "start fires" in the countryside in opposition to agricultural cooperativization, were also criticized at the meeting. Both of Fei Xiaotong's articles used suggestive, allusive, and illusory language, doing everything possible to oppose agricultural cooperativization and the policy of unified purchase and sale. He also distorted the reality of greatly improved peasant life, insisting that "farmers' income has not increased much." In fact, even according to the materials he investigated in Jiang Village, the average income of each farmer in 1956 was 168 jin more than in 1936. In these two articles, Fei Xiaotong also blatantly praised capitalist accumulation and the "diligence and thrift" of capitalists in starting businesses, and specifically proposed restoring the free operation of the transportation industry in the countryside. The purpose of Fei Xiaotong's writing "Revisiting Jiang Village," in addition to his own admission that it was to "start fires" in the countryside and prepare to publish it in Britain to provide information to imperialism, was especially important as a "political capital" for the Zhang-Luo alliance to attack the Communist Party. This can be explained by his hasty notification to the New Observer magazine that it must be published before the National People's Congress meeting. Several people who had read his book "Jiangcun Economy," published in English in Britain twenty years ago, pointed out at the meeting that Fei Xiaotong's denial of the landlord's exploitation of peasants in the Chinese countryside, his advocacy of "native industry" in the countryside, his dissemination of buying Japanese machines (at that time, the Japanese invaders had already occupied the Northeast), his talk of large-scale industry (actually wanting imperialism to run industry), and other views reflected in his "Jiangcun Economy" twenty years ago were reflected almost unchanged in his "Revisiting Jiang Village." They said that it seems that Fei Xiaotong's ideological essence of "democratic individualism" has not changed.

At the meeting, some people also exposed Fei Xiaotong's collusion with Luo Longji, destroying the Party's work in every possible way, and also shooting a cold arrow in the work of overseas students.

Lei Jieqiong, Deputy Director of the Expert Bureau, also revealed Fei Xiaotong's relationship with Pan Guangdan in her speech, as well as Fei Xiaotong's past relationship with some American secret agents.

Zhao Shougong, Deputy Director of the Expert Bureau, said in his speech that from the materials exposed at the meeting, it can be clearly seen that Fei Xiaotong's thinking is extremely reactionary, and he is an ugly political careerist disguised as a "scholar." He said that from Fei Xiaotong's remarks and activities on the issue of intellectuals, he is a backbone member of the Zhang-Luo alliance, and his activities are an integral part of the Zhang-Luo alliance.

Qi Yanming, Director of the Expert Bureau, pointed out that Fei Xiaotong's series of anti-Communist and anti-socialist remarks and actions are by no means just an unconscious reflection of bourgeois ideology, as he himself has repeatedly confessed, but are conscious, purposeful, planned, and step-by-step. Qi Yanming also particularly pointed out that Fei Xiaotong has always used the two-faced method and obscure tone to confuse people. If he is always unwilling to completely wash off the powder smeared on his face and honestly confess his reactionary words and deeds, it cannot be said that he has truly confessed his crimes to the people.

### 在基层点火为章罗策划罪恶严重  费孝通还没有真正低头认罪  国务院专家局举行会议继续揭发批判

    在基层点火为章罗策划罪恶严重
    费孝通还没有真正低头认罪
    国务院专家局举行会议继续揭发批判
    新华社16日讯  国务院专家局8月7日举行揭露和批判右派分子费孝通的第二次会议。
    会上首先揭露了费孝通从知识分子问题上向共产党进攻的阴谋活动。据揭露，费孝通否定共产党的知识分子工作的成绩，夸大缺点；曲解共产党的知识分子政策，抗拒思想改造；并有计划地写了“知识分子的早春天气”等文章，企图逐步夺取共产党对知识分子的领导权。去年和费孝通一起到西南工作的同志揭露了费孝通去年到成都、昆明等地所进行的罪恶活动。去年8月，费孝通曾以专家局副局长的身份，打着“了解知识分子工作情况”的旗号去西南活动。他事先拟定了一个专门搜集反党材料的调查提纲，到成都、昆明后，他以民盟名义，召开了知识分子小型座谈会。参加那两次座谈会的，据调查最近上了报的右派分子就有十五人，其中成都七人，昆明八人。那两次座谈会实际上是他们向共产党进攻的“动员会”，费孝通在座谈会上撒下了“火种”。他恶毒地用“西南山高地远，风刮的慢”，西南高等学校只会“奉公守法，闻风而起”，“西南一、二级教授太少”，“评价不公”，并说西南民盟成员是“木头人”、“不会动脑筋”、“百依百顺”等，恶毒地煽动右派分子向共产党进攻，并企图迷惑一些认识不清的人。费孝通在成都时曾拍着胸脯说：“我费孝通是来解决问题的，否则我没脸再来四川”。又说：“我费孝通就不奉公守法。高等教育部要我们民族学院订什么科学研究规划，我一个电话就给顶回去了”。他还说：“卫生部在北京召开医学教育会议，有些盟员代表到民盟总部反映了意见，民盟总部通知了卫生部，结果原来开的会就不算数。”（以上两件事情，经调查都不是事实）他给右派分子撑腰，动员他们“揭盖子”、争“民主、自由”。座谈会以后，费孝通还采取互相串联的办法，进一步组织右派分子的力量。在昆明，他发现曲艺界有空子可钻，也点了“火”。
    对于费孝通的反对农业合作化企图到农村“点火”的两篇农村调查——“重访江村”，在会上也作了批判。费孝通这两篇文章都是用暗示影射、虚虚实实的笔法，极尽了反对农业合作化和统购统销政策之能事。他并且歪曲农民生活大大改善的实际，硬说“农民收入并未提高多少”。实际上，就是按照他在江村调查的材料计算，1956年每个农民的平均收入比1936年多收入一百六十八斤。费孝通在这两篇文章里，还明目张胆地歌颂资本主义积累和资本家的“勤俭”兴业，并具体地提出在农村恢复资本主义的自由经营的运输业。费孝通写“重访江村”的目的，除了他自己承认是到农村“点火”，并准备把它拿到英国去出版，供给帝国主义资料外，尤其重要的，是拿它作为章罗联盟向共产党进攻的“政治资本”。这从他急忙通知新观察杂志必须在全国人民代表大会会议以前刊登出来就可以说明。有几个人曾经看了他二十年前用英文在英国出版的“江村经济”一书，他们在会上指出，费孝通二十年前在“江村经济”中反映的那些否认中国农村地主对农民的剥削，主张在乡村中搞“乡土工业”，散布买日本机器（当时日寇已占领了东北），谈大工业（实际是要帝国主义来办工业）等等观点，几乎原封未动的又反映到他的“重访江村”一文中来。他们说，看来费孝通的“民主个人主义”的思想本质仍然未变。
    会上还有些人揭露了费孝通和罗隆基互相勾结，无孔不入地破坏党的工作，在留学生工作上也放了一支冷箭。
    专家局副局长雷洁琼在发言中还揭露了费孝通同潘光旦的关系，以及费孝通过去同美国一些特务的关系。
    专家局副局长赵守攻发言说，从会上揭露出的材料，可以清楚地看到费孝通的思想是极其反动的，他是一个披着“学者”外衣的丑恶的政治野心家。他说，从费孝通在知识分子问题上的言论和活动看来，他是章罗联盟的骨干分子，他的活动是章罗联盟的一个组成部分。
    专家局局长齐燕铭指出，费孝通一系列的反共产党反社会主义的言论和行动，绝不是像他自己历次交代中所说的只是资产阶级思想不自觉的反映，而是有意识、有目的、有计划、有步骤的。齐燕铭还特别指出，费孝通一向是以两面派的手法、隐晦的笔调来迷惑人的。如果他始终不肯把擦在脸上的粉彻底洗掉，老老实实交代他的反动言行，还不能说他是已经真正向人民认罪。
