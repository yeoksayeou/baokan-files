Lanzhou Thermal Power Plant is a high-temperature and high-pressure power plant that the Soviet Union helped China build during its First Five-Year Plan. Since construction began in December 1955, the complicated installation of boilers and steam turbine generators was completed in only about one year and ten months due to the adoption of the latest Soviet technology – combined installation.
After the first phase of this power plant is fully put into production, the power generation will be 120 times greater than that of the Lanzhou Power Plant in 1949. In the future, this large power plant will not only supply enough electricity, steam and boiling water to the newly built factories in Lanzhou, but also supply electricity to Yongdeng Cement Plant and Baiyin City. The picture shows the exterior view of the completed Lanzhou Thermal Power Plant.

    兰州热电站是苏联帮助我国在第一个五年计划期间建设的一座高温高压电站。自1955年12月动工兴建以来，由于采用了苏联最新技术——组合安装的方法，仅用约一年零十个月时间，就完成了复杂的锅炉和汽轮发电机的安装工程。
    这座电站第一期工程全部投入生产后，发电量比1949年兰州电厂的发电量，增大一百二十倍。这座大型电站，将来除供兰州新建工厂足够的电力、蒸汽和开水之外，还能供应永登水泥厂、白银市等用电。图为落成后的兰州热电站外景。
