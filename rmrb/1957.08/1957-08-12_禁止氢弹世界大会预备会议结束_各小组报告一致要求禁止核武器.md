Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 10th: The international preparatory meeting for the Third World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament held its plenary session this afternoon at the Kanda Gakushi Kaikan in Tokyo.

The Soviet delegation, which arrived in Tokyo last night, was warmly welcomed by the entire audience as it entered the venue.

The head of the Soviet delegation, Kairov, addressed the conference, saying that he wished the conference great success on behalf of the Soviet people.

The four groups that conducted group discussions on the 8th and 9th presented reports and statements on the results of their discussions to the conference.

Australian representative Browning, representing the group of scientists studying radioactivity, reported to the conference that this group supports the immediate prohibition of nuclear weapons testing and the establishment of an international monitoring system, and further supports the prohibition of nuclear weapons so that war does not occur, and that scientists serve entirely for the benefit of mankind.

Australian representative Goldbloom presented a report on behalf of the group of peace activists. He said that this group suggests that the international preparatory meeting submit a proposal to the formal plenary session of the World Conference, demanding the immediate prohibition of the use, manufacture, and stockpiling of nuclear weapons, opposing the transportation of atomic weapons into other countries, and the establishment of military bases and atomic bases in other countries, and the realization of comprehensive disarmament. In order to achieve the above requirements, this group requests that the three major powers possessing nuclear weapons immediately and unconditionally conclude an agreement prohibiting nuclear weapons testing, and take possible measures to promote the realization of the prohibition of nuclear weapons testing by the United Nations General Assembly.

American representative Jekko presented a report on behalf of the group of pacifists and religious figures, saying that the group meeting requested that all existing religious groups work together to prohibit nuclear weapons, achieve disarmament, and maintain peace.

The representative of the group of experts on international law and disarmament issues, Yoshitaro Hirano, strongly demanded in his report that the major world powers never stop the London disarmament conference and continue discussions until an agreement is reached.

Finally, the chairman of the international preparatory meeting, Ikuo Yasui, delivered a closing speech. He expressed his hope that representatives from various countries would build on the achievements already made and work harder to ensure the success of the formal plenary session held from the 12th.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 10th: The Soviet delegation to the Third World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament, led by Kairov, member of the Soviet Peace Defense Committee and Dean of the Academy of Educational Sciences of the Russian Federation, arrived in Tokyo on the evening of the 9th.

Due to the unreasonable entry conditions previously put forward by the Japanese government, the Soviet delegation participating in this World Conference was unable to arrive in Tokyo in time for the opening of the conference.

Xinhua News Agency, August 11th: TASS News Agency, New York, August 11th: Famous Mexican painter Diego Rivera published an appeal in the "Workers Daily Weekly," calling on painters and cultural workers around the world to support the immediate cessation of testing of thermonuclear weapons and atomic bombs, at least for three years. Diego Rivera said: "In this way, we can guarantee a breather, during which people can regain their senses and reach an international agreement on prohibiting the production and use of thermonuclear weapons..."
