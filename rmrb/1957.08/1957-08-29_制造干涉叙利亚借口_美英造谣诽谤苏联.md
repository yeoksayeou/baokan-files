Xinhua News Agency, August 28th: TASS, Moscow: "Pravda" wrote on the 27th that the US and British imperialists, after suffering a crushing defeat, are still frantically searching for excuses to openly interfere in Syria's internal affairs.

"Pravda" pointed out that the report by the "Daily Express" correspondent in Damascus is an example of shameless fabrication. This reporter "revealed" that "thousands of Russian volunteers are now arriving in" Syria by sea and air.

"Pravda" pointed out that it is not the first time that the US and British imperialists have used lies and slander against the Soviet Union to conceal their provocations against the people of the Middle East countries. They lied when the "Dulles-Eisenhower Doctrine" was launched. They are lying now, trying to force people who are unwilling to put the shackles of American colonialism on themselves to accept this "Doctrine."

Xinhua News Agency, August 28th: TASS, London, August 27th: Prominent Labor Party figure Richard Crossman exposed in the "Daily Mirror" the slanderous remarks of the American propaganda machine that Syria was "turning to communism." He pointed out that the purpose of this American propaganda was merely "to cover up its shameful diplomatic failure in this Arab country."

Crossman said that Syria had requested assistance from the United States, but "a small amount of dollars came with a lot of political conditions, and Syria had to accept American protection in order to get those dollars."

Crossman pointed out that when the Syrian delegation went to Moscow, the Soviet Union agreed to provide Syria with economic assistance "without political conditions." The author said: "There is no question of turning to communism or other nonsense to explain why the Syrian government accepted this Russian aid."

　  制造干涉叙利亚借口
　　美英造谣诽谤苏联
    据新华社28日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”27日写道，美英帝国主义者在遭到惨败后，仍在慌忙地寻找公开干涉叙利亚内政的借口。
      “真理报”指出，英国“每日快报”驻大马士革记者的报道就是厚颜无耻的捏造的例子。这个记者“透露”，似乎“现在正有数千名俄国志愿人员从海上和空中来到”叙利亚。
      “真理报”指出，美英帝国主义者利用谎言和诽谤苏联的方法掩饰自己对中近东各国人民的挑衅已经不是第一次了。他们在“杜勒斯—艾森豪威尔主义”出笼时，就曾说谎。他们现在又在说谎，企图强迫那些不愿把美国殖民主义枷锁套在自己头上的人民接受这个“主义”。
    据新华社28日讯　据塔斯社伦敦27日讯：工党著名人士理查德·克罗斯曼在“每日镜报”上揭露了美国宣传机关硬说叙利亚“转向共产主义”的谰言。他指出，美国这种宣传的目的不过是“要掩盖它在这个阿拉伯国家外交上所遭到的可耻的失败”。
    克罗斯曼说，叙利亚曾经请求美国援助，但是“很少数量的美元却要附上一大堆政治条件，叙利亚为了要得到这一点美元就必需接受美国的保护”。
    克罗斯曼指出，当叙利亚派代表团到莫斯科的时候，苏联却同意给予叙利亚“不附带政治条件”的经济援助。作者说：“要说明叙利亚政府为什么会接受俄国这种援助，根本谈不上什么倒向共产主义之类的胡说”。
