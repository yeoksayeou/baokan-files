Standing at the Forefront of Struggle, Breaking Through Fierce Winds and Waves
　　Communist Party Member Wang Zongyuan Firm in His Stance

　　In early June, Wang Zongyuan, a Communist Party member and a fourth-year student in the Geography Department of Northwest Normal College, keenly discerned the reactionary essence behind some of the big-character posters when many people at the Normal College were still unable to distinguish between fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds amidst the myriad of big-character posters. He indignantly repeatedly requested the Party organization to launch a counterattack. He said to Liu Guangyong, another Communist Party member in the same class, "This isn't helping the Party's rectification movement; it's clearly an attack on the Party by the enemy."

　　To defend the Party, Wang Zongyuan wrote his first big-character poster in counterattack. At the time, some classmates, fearing that he would suffer even greater blows as a result, advised him not to post it. But he said with conviction, "For the sake of the Party, I'm not afraid of him. If I were afraid, I wouldn't write it."

　　On the evening of June 7th, the rightists at the Normal College were engaging in large-scale activities, staging a strike that reached a fever pitch. The rightist Wang Shangxian even forced Wang Zongyuan to express his attitude toward the strike. Wang Zongyuan replied decisively, "I resolutely oppose the strike! We have heard Chairman Mao's report 'On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People,' and we know that strikes are not a good thing. Why do you want to do this?" "The atmosphere in our class is very unhealthy." Despite the rightists' clamoring against the leadership of the Party and calling for a strike, their attempt did not succeed.

　　"No Philosophy Exam" was also one of the "reasons" used by the rightists in the Geography Department's fourth grade to incite students, constantly stir up trouble, and confuse the masses. Of the thirty students in the class, only Du Wengui, Wang Zongyuan, Liu Guangyong, and Liu Anmin expressed disagreement with boycotting the exam. As a result, a series of labels, such as "undermining unity" and "lacking a sense of justice," were placed on their heads. Wang Zongyuan said without changing his expression, "Letting off steam is letting off steam, and exams are exams. You can't stop taking exams just because we're letting off steam. Classmates, exams are correct. If you don't take it, I will. I'll answer as much as I know, and I definitely won't hand in a blank paper." "We've studied for several years and taken exams for several years. What kind of talk is it to not take one subject at the end? Is this the action that college students of the New China should take? You can scold me all you want, but I'm still going to take the exam." In the end, thanks to the school and teachers' persuasion and education, most of the students changed their attitude, and the rightists' conspiracy to boycott the exam fell through.

　　Under the planning and control of the rightists, the Geography Department's fourth grade held a nearly three-day conference from the afternoon of July 7th to the morning of July 10th to "struggle" against the Party and Party members. At the meeting, they negated the achievements of the anti-rightist campaign, slandered the leadership of the Party, deliberately exaggerated the shortcomings of Party members, and viciously launched personal attacks. Wang Zongyuan was falsely accused by the rightists of being a "Party hack," "class tyrant," "department tyrant," and "local emperor." But although Wang Zongyuan and others were under a cloud and struggled against for three days, they did not waver in their revolutionary stance.

　　When the anti-rightist struggle began throughout the school, he actively participated in the anti-rightist struggle in the department and section. At first, many of the students in his class had relatively serious right-leaning thoughts and believed that there were no rightists. However, he and the class's Party members and activists worked together to identify five rightist elements in the class and exposed an anti-Party small group headed by Deng Jianwu.

　  站在斗争前列　冲破凶风恶浪
　　共产党员王宗元立场坚定
    6月初，西北师范学院地理系四年级学生共产党员王宗元，在师范学院许多人对五花八门的大字报中还分辨不清哪是香花、哪是毒草的时候，就锐敏地透视出了一些大字报后边的反动本质，气愤地一再向党组织请求予以反击。他给同班另一共产党员刘光永说：“这那里是帮助党整风，这分明是敌人向党的进攻。”
    王宗元为着保卫党，便写出了第一张反击的大字报。当时一些同学怕他会因此而遭到更大的打击，劝他不要贴出去。但他理直气壮的说：“为了党，我就不怕他，怕他就不写。”
    6月7日晚上，师范学院的右派分子们大肆活动罢课，疯狂到了顶点。右派分子王尚贤又逼着要王宗元表示对罢课的态度。王宗元斩钉截铁的答道：“罢课，我坚决反对！我们听过了毛主席‘关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题’的传达报告，知道罢课并不是件好事情，为什么要这样做呢？”“我们班上的风气是很不正的。”尽管右派分子如何叫嚣不要党的领导，要罢课，但他们的企图并未实现。
      “不考哲学”，这也是地理系四年级右派分子煽动同学、一味点火、迷惑群众的“理由”之一。全班三十个人，表示不同意罢考的只有杜文贵、王宗元、刘光永、刘安民四位同学。于是“破坏团结”“没有正义感的人”等一连串的大帽子压在了他们的头上。王宗元声色不改地说：“鸣放是鸣放，考试是考试，不能因鸣放连试也不考。同学们，考试是正确的，你们不考我要考，我知道多少答多少，决不交白卷。”“学了几年，考了几年，最后剩下一门课不考这像什么话，难道是新中国的大学生应有的举动？再骂我也要考试。”最后，由于学校和先生们的说服教育，大多数同学改变了态度，右派分子们的罢考阴谋破产了。
    在右派分子的策划与掌握下，地理系四年级从7月7日下午到10日上午，进行了历时将近三天的大会，向党和党员们进行“斗争”。会上否定肃反成绩、诽谤党的领导、有意夸大党员缺点、恶毒地进行人身攻击。王宗元被右派分子诬为“党棍”“班霸”“系霸”“土皇帝”。但王宗元等虽然头顶乌云，被斗三天，并没有动摇了革命的立场。
    全校反右派斗争开始了，他便积极参加了系和科的反右派斗争。开始，他所在班的同学们许多人右倾思想较为严重，认为没有右派，但他和全班党员积极分子一道研究在班里发现了五个右派分子，并揭发了以邓建武为首的一个反党小集团。（摘自甘肃日报）
