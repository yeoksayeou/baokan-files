Revisiting Huangshi
Cao Ming

About five hours after the large ship on the Han-Hu line departs from Hankou, the female announcer can be heard introducing: "Passengers, the place with the towering chimneys and various colors of smoke and clouds ahead is Huangshi, our country's emerging industrial city!"

I lived in Huangshi for three years. Without going ashore for a closer look, I can distinguish each factory from the color of the smoke, the shape of the chimneys, and their location. I am truly very familiar with Huangshi.

However, this time I was surprised as soon as I went ashore. When I first came here in early 1951, the road along the river was very narrow, squeezed by protruding hills and ponds, and one often heard of people riding their bicycles and falling down the slopes or bridges. When I left here in early 1954, tens of thousands of people had already leveled mountains and filled in lakes, building a wide macadam road along the river. What appeared before my eyes now was a high-grade cement road, with many flower beds set up in the middle of the street. The open spaces on both sides of the street were also filled with many two-story, three-story, and four-story buildings. From 1952, only three buses traveled along the river road, but now the lines cover the whole city, and there are more and newer vehicles. I went to a friend's house in the city, and he handed me a cup of tea, while declaring, "This is tap water!" When I left here, except for a few factories and mines, the residents in the city still fetched water from the river and ponds, but now the city has tap water. This is something that many provincial capitals in old China could not do!

Huangshi was only changed from Huangshi Town in Daye County to a province-administered city in 1950, but this place has a long history. Across the river, it is said that Zhou Yu, who defeated Cao Cao's army, once sang and danced here, hence the name "Sanhua Zhou" (Scattering Flower Islet). Near the Daye Steel Plant is Xisai Mountain, where the great poet Du Fu once wrote the poem "Nostalgia at Xisai Mountain": "Wang Jun's warships descended from Yizhou, the aura of Jinling faded away. A thousand fathoms of iron chains sank to the bottom of the river, a single surrender banner emerged from Stone City..." It vividly describes a period of history at the end of the Three Kingdoms: Sun Hao, the ruler of Wu, used iron chains here to block the river in order to prevent Sima Yan's navy, but the iron chains were burned by the Jin general Wang Jun, and the warships went straight to the Wu capital, Stone City, and Sun Hao had no choice but to surrender.

In 1890, the Hanyang Iron Works built a railway directly from Tieshan to the river here, transporting iron ore. In 1922, the Hanyeping Company built two blast furnaces with a daily output of 450 tons of pig iron, the largest in the country at the time. Two coal mines, a cement plant, and a power plant were also built here, forming a heavy industrial zone in central China.

Huangshi has ample conditions for development. In this small area, there are high-quality, world-famous iron ore deposits, copper mines with even greater value than the entire iron ore deposits, anthracite coal mines, and limestone mines necessary for manufacturing cement and smelting steel. In particular, it is close to the river, with convenient transportation, which is even more advantageous than other mining areas, making development convenient. However, in the sixty years before liberation, the industry here declined. At the time of liberation, the Daye Steel Plant was still a "Central China Iron and Steel Company" that produced neither iron nor steel. Huaxin produced several thousand tons of cement that could not be sold. The power plant generated very little electricity, and it was not fully utilized. Yuanhua and Lihua coal mines were also trapped in economic difficulties.

After liberation, the Party and the People's Government attached great importance to this place, changed it to a province-administered city, and sent a large number of cadres to work with the city's workers to restore and develop production. The stagnant industry recovered and increased year by year. In 1950, Huaxin produced 35,000 tons of cement, and last year's output increased to more than 550,000 tons of cement. Last year, steel production increased more than 20 times compared to 1950, and other products such as coal, electricity, iron, steel, lime, bricks, and tiles have also seen great increases. The Daye Steel Plant initially used the old pair of small Bessemer converters for production, smelting a furnace of steel every two days; using small blast furnaces to smelt iron, producing more than 20 tons of iron per day. The fact that they went from no production to starting production was already praised by some technicians, but they have now achieved more than 100 furnaces of steel per day with Bessemer converters and more than 100 tons of iron per day with small blast furnaces. Since 1953, they have also started producing high-quality steel that old China had never smelted. Now they can smelt 180 kinds of high-quality steel, and last year alone they supplied tens of thousands of tons of high-quality steel to 1,198 factories and construction units across the country. The newly built copper mine has also been put into production.

Large-scale construction is underway here, including the expansion project of the Daye Steel Plant and the construction projects of the Daye Iron Mine and the rubber factory. In the future, a large-scale smelting plant, a chemical factory, and many small factories will also be built. I visited the Daye Steel Plant construction site and saw that the original stone mountain and several large ponds had been leveled. The newly built steelmaking plant stands between the old workshops, making the existing production scale seem very small. Thousands of workers are still building workshops for large rolling mills and other units. After the completion of its first phase, it will increase the country's output of high-quality steel by one-third.

In early 1951, there were only nearly 80,000 people here, with 180,000 square meters of houses, most of which were dilapidated mud houses and thatched sheds. Now the city has 180,000 people. A large number of staff dormitories have also been built in Chenjiawan, Shenjiaying, and Tieshan. A total of more than 380,000 square meters of houses (excluding factory buildings) have been newly built in the city in the past seven years, which is more than twice the total construction area in the sixty years before liberation. They have also built 40 roads totaling 59 kilometers in the city and built a bustling main street along the riverside avenue. The Commercial Bureau has also set up 40 comprehensive stores in various factories, mines, and residential areas, making it very convenient for employees to buy all kinds of daily necessities they need in one store.

In 1951, there was only one theater and cinema converted from an old, unventilated temple, with 500 seats. In the second year, a workers' theater with 1,200 seats was built. The Daye Steel Plant also converted the original auditorium into a cinema. Now, eight entertainment venues such as the Huangshi Theater, the Dazhong Theater, the Tieshan Cinema, and the Workers' Cultural Palace have been newly built. The number of schools in Huangshi has also increased from eleven primary schools with more than 3,000 students in the early days of liberation to 48 primary schools with 16,000 students; from one middle school with more than 140 students to five middle schools with 2,400 students. Two new secondary vocational schools have also been built, with nearly 1,000 students; sixteen new kindergartens have been built, accommodating more than 1,000 children. The number of hospitals has also increased from two with 120 beds to six with 1,020 beds. The workers' sanatorium set up in Mount Lu is not included in the calculation.

I visited the Daye Technical School and the Municipal Third Hospital. The Third Hospital was only built last year, and all the wards are either three-person or six-person rooms, which are very comfortable. I also visited their physiotherapy room with electrotherapy and phototherapy equipment, two large operating rooms with new shadowless lamps, an obstetrics and gynecology room with three universal operating tables, and an "X-ray" room. This equipment was not something that ordinary hospitals could have before liberation, but the equipment in this hospital only ranks fourth in Huangshi City.

On Saturday night, I went to the newly built Workers' Cultural Palace. In the rooms on both sides of the door, some people were playing table tennis. Behind it is a large hall with a terrazzo floor, where many young people are practicing skating. Upstairs, the reading room on the left displays various newspapers and magazines; in the room on the right and in the corridor, some adults are playing chess and cards, and some Young Pioneers are playing carrom. Turning right out of the building, I heard the distinct melody of dance music and saw the dim red and green neon lights, and fashionably dressed young men and women were dancing in the newly built dance floor. Next to it is a children's playground equipped with slides and seesaws. An open-air movie is being shown in the back. I walked to the left and saw many adults brewing a pot of tea and lying on bamboo chairs to cool off in a quaint corridor. The songs and laughter of young men and women came from the woods behind the corridor. Several yachts were docked on the small river next to it. It turned out that this small river surrounding the Cultural Palace leads directly to the large lake behind, and people can go boating on the lake. What a beautiful park!

In the old society, the formation of a city often took decades, even hundreds of years; in the new society, the Party and the People's Government built Huangshi into a modern city in seven years, completing the work that was not completed in sixty years! Can this be denied by right-wingers with their eyes closed?

    重游黄石
    曹铭
    汉沪线的大轮船开出汉口约五小时，就听见女播音员在介绍：“旅客们，前面烟囱林立、冒着各种颜色的烟云的地方，就是我国新兴的工业城市——黄石！”
    我曾在黄石住过三年。不用上岸细看，我就能从煤烟的颜色、烟囱的形状和位置，辨别出各个工厂。对黄石，我真是太熟悉了。
    但是，这一次我刚上岸，就吃了一惊。我1951年初刚来这里，沿江的一条道路被伸出的山头和湖塘挤的很窄，时常听见有人骑着车子摔到坡下或桥下去；1954年初离开这里，成千上万的人已经削山填湖，沿江筑起了宽阔的碎石大马路。现在出现在我眼前的，却是高级水泥路面的大街，街中间还设有许多花坛。街道两旁的空地，也盖起了许多两层、三层和四层的楼房。从1952年起才有三辆公共汽车在沿江马路行驶，现在线路遍布全市，车辆也多了、新了。我到市里一个朋友家去，他递了杯茶给我，同时就声明说：“这是自来水！”我离开这里的时候，除了几个厂矿外，市里居民都还从江里、塘里挑水喝，而现时市里已有自来水了，这是旧中国许多省城都办不到的事情啊！
    黄石，是1950年才由大冶县的黄石镇改建为省辖市的，但这个地方的历史很悠久。它的对岸，传说大败曹兵的周瑜曾在此载歌载舞，故取名“散花洲”。邻近大冶钢厂的西塞山，大诗人杜甫曾经写过“西塞山怀古”的诗：“王浚楼船下益州，金陵王气黯然收。千寻铁锁沉江底，一片降幡出石头。……”具体描写了三国末年的一段历史：吴主孙皓在此用铁锁拦断江面，以阻挡司马炎的水军，但被晋将王浚将铁锁烧断，战舰便直抵吴都石头城下，孙皓只好出降。
    1890年，汉阳铁厂从铁山修了条铁路直达这里江边，由此转运铁矿。1922年，汉冶萍公司又先后在此建了两座当时是全国最大的日产四百五十吨生铁的高炉。这里还建起了两座煤矿、一座水泥厂和一座电厂，在我国中部形成了一个重工业区。
    黄石是有充分发展的条件的。在这个不大的地区里，埋藏有品质优良、著名世界的铁矿，有比整个铁矿价值还大的铜矿，有无烟煤矿，以及制造水泥和冶炼钢铁所必需的石灰石矿。特别是它又临近江边，交通方便，比别的矿区更是得天独厚，开发方便。但是，在解放前的六十年里，这里的工业反而衰落了。临解放时，大冶钢厂还是个既不出铁、又不出钢的“华中钢铁公司”。华新出了几千吨水泥卖不出去。电厂发出很少的电也用不完。源华、利华煤矿也都陷在经济拮据的困窘中。
    一解放，党和人民政府就非常重视这个地方，将它改为省辖市，并派了大批干部来同全市职工一起恢复和发展生产。停滞的工业复苏了，并且逐年上涨。1950年，华新生产三万五千吨水泥，去年的产量又增至五十五万多吨水泥。去年钢的产量比1950年增长了二十多倍，其他如煤、电、铁、钢材、石灰、砖瓦等都有很大的增长。大冶钢厂最初利用旧有的一对小贝氏炉生产，两天炼一炉钢；利用小高炉炼铁，一天出二十多吨铁。从没有生产到开始生产，已为一些技术人员赞叹不已，而他们现在已做到贝氏炉一天炼一百多炉钢，小高炉一天出一百多吨铁。他们从1953年起又开始生产旧中国从未炼过的优质钢，现时已能炼一百八十种优质钢，去年一年就供应了全国一千一百九十八个工厂和工程单位若干万吨的优质钢材。新建的铜矿也投入了生产。
    正在这里大规模地进行建设的，有大冶钢厂的扩建工程，大冶铁矿和橡胶厂的建设工程。将来还要兴建一座规模巨大的冶炼厂、一座化学工厂和许多小型工厂。我去大冶钢厂工地参观，看见原有的一座石山和几个大塘都已炸平填齐。新起的炼钢厂房矗立在旧车间之间，使现有的生产规模显得很小很小。成千的工人还在修建大型轧钢厂等单位的厂房。它的第一期工程建成后，就将使全国的优质钢产量增加三分之一。
    1951年初这里只有近八万人，十八万平方公尺的房屋，绝大多数都是破旧的土屋和茅棚。现在全市已有十八万人。在陈家湾、沈家营和铁山等地也盖起了一大片一大片的职工宿舍。全市七年来总共新盖了三十八万多平方公尺的房屋（不包括厂房），为解放前六十年建筑总面积的两倍多。他们还在市里修了四十条、五十九公里的道路，并在沿江大道建起了热闹的大街。商业局也在各个厂矿和各个住宅区设立了四十个综合商店，职工们去一家商店，就可将所需的各种日用品买齐，非常方便。
    1951年这里只有一个由不通风的旧庙改成的剧场兼电影院，五百个座位。第二年，盖了一座有一千二百个座位的工人剧院。大冶钢厂又利用原有的礼堂改建了一座电影院。现在，又新建了黄石剧场、大众剧场、铁山电影院和工人文化宫等八个娱乐场所。黄石的学校也由解放初期的十一所小学、三千来人，增加为四十八所小学、一万六千人；由一所中学、一百四十多人，增加为五所中学、二千四百多人。还新建了两所中等专业学校，近一千人；新建了十六所幼儿园，容纳一千多名儿童。医院也由两座、一百二十张病床，增加为六座、一千零二十张病床。在庐山设立的工人疗养院还没有计算在内。
    我参观了大冶技工学校和市立第三医院。第三医院是去年才建成的，都是三人一间或六人一间的病房，很舒适。我还参观了他们的具有电疗、光疗设备的理疗室、具有新式无影灯的两间大手术室、具有三架万能手术台的妇产室和“爱克斯光”室，这些设备在解放前都不是普通的医院所能设置的，但这座医院的设备，在黄石市还只能占第四位。
    星期六晚上，我去新建的工人文化宫。门前两边的房里，有些人在打乒乓球。后面是一个水磨地坪的大厅，许多青年正在这里练习滑冰。楼上左边是阅览室，陈列着各种报纸、杂志；右面房里和走廊上，有些成年人在下棋，打牌，一些红领巾在打克朗球。从大楼出来向右拐，就听见旋律鲜明的舞曲和看见黯红黯绿的霓虹灯光，穿着入时的青年男女正在新建的舞池里跳舞。它的旁边还有个设置有滑梯和翘翘板的儿童游戏场。后面正在放映露天电影。我走到左边，在一座古香古色的回廊上，看见很多成年人泡上一壶茶，躺在竹椅上乘凉。廊后的树林里传出了青年男女的歌声和笑声。旁边的小河停靠着几只游艇，原来这环绕文化宫的小河直通后面的大湖，人们可以在湖上泛舟。这真是一座美丽的公园！
    在旧社会里，一个城市的形成往往需要几十年，甚至上百年；在新社会里，党和人民政府七年就将黄石建成了一个现代化的城市，完成了六十年没有完成的事业！这难道是右派分子闭着眼睛所能抹杀得了的吗。（附图片）
