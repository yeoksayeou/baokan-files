Xinhua News Agency, New York, 1st Dispatch: A recent report in "Newsweek" magazine by Dr. Remmers of the Education Department of Purdue University on the ideological state of American youth reveals the imprint left by America's Cold War and fascist propaganda on the ideological consciousness of young people.

Remmers said that among the 25,000 high school students he surveyed, he discovered many "startling" phenomena. For example, 60% of these students believed that books and magazines should be censored; 83% supported the FBI's wiretapping; 34% believed that the government should prohibit certain people from expressing their opinions; 26% believed that it was perfectly acceptable to search private homes and persons without a warrant; and 13% believed that religious beliefs should be restricted by law. Almost half of the people (49%) believed that people could not judge good from bad for themselves. More than a third (39%) believed that visiting foreigners should not be allowed to criticize the United States. Almost half (46%) were unwilling to have women hold public office.

The report said that many young people also complained about abnormal relationships with their parents and expressed dissatisfaction with their school teachers.

Remmers said that today's American high school students are "ideologically confused, afraid, and very dependent." He admitted that the situation of young people is inseparable from "hot and cold wars" and "bewitching television."

Remmers said that the situation of American youth is only to a large extent a reflection of the situation of adults today, because American adults today are also unstable and ideologically confused.

    在冷战和法西斯宣传毒害下
    美国青年思想胡里胡涂
    许多人认为限制言论自由是应该的
    新华社1日讯　纽约消息：美国“新闻周刊”最近刊载了帕都大学教育系雷默斯博士对美国青少年思想状况的调查报告，这个报告显示出美国的冷战和法西斯宣传在青少年思想意识中留下的烙印。
    雷默斯说，在他调查过的两万五千名高中学生中，他发现了许多“令人吃惊”的现象。例如，这些学生有60％认为应当检查书报杂志；83％拥护联邦调查局偷听电话；34％认为政府应当禁止某些人发表言论；26％认为没有拘捕状就搜查民房和人身是完全可以的；13％认为宗教信仰应当受到法律的限制。几乎有一半的人（49％）相信人们不能自行判断好坏。三分之一以上的人（39％）认为不应准许来访的外国人批评美国。几乎有半数的人（46％）不愿再要妇女担任公职。
    这个报告说，许多青少年还抱怨他们和父母亲之间的关系不正常，他们对学校的教师也表示不满。
    雷默斯说，今天的美国高中学生是“思想混乱的、害怕的、依赖性很大的”。他承认青少年们的这种情况是同“热战和冷战”以及“使人着魔的电视”分不开的。
    雷默斯说，美国青年人的情况只不过是在很大程度上反映了今天成年人的情况，因为今天的美国成年人也是不稳定和思想混乱的。
