Xinhua News Agency, August 17th: Ambassador of Indonesia to China, Wijo Pranoto, held a reception this evening to celebrate the 12th anniversary of the Republic of Indonesia's independence.

Vice Chairman Zhu De attended the reception.

Ambassador Wijo Pranoto spoke at the beginning of the reception, expressing his gratitude to the guests.

Wijo Pranoto said that Indonesia's revolution is a comprehensive and simultaneous revolution, to be carried out in all aspects of life. First, the Indonesian revolution is a national revolution, which is to strive for independence from the colonizers and to enrich this national independence with a national economy. In addition, the Indonesian revolution is also a social revolution, which aims to eliminate poverty and establish a just and prosperous society. Finally, Indonesia's revolution is a cultural revolution, which is to establish a new culture suitable for our own way of life. Because the revolution is comprehensive and must be carried out consistently, it is obviously arduous and cannot be completed in a short period of time. However, no matter how arduous the struggles that the Indonesian nation faces now and in the future, due to the strong will of the Indonesian nation, the Indonesian nation will safely overcome the above-mentioned revolutions and will eventually achieve victory.

He also said that in terms of foreign relations, Indonesia pursues a policy called independent and autonomous. This policy is different from a neutral policy, because Indonesia often actively participates in the cause of defending world peace and eliminating international tension. Indonesia is always active in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism. Some people say that Indonesia's independent and autonomous policy is immoral. This is completely wrong. Indonesia's independent and autonomous policy is an expression of the Indonesian nation's moral values and the moral values of Eastern countries.

At the end of his speech, he proposed a toast to the health of Chairman Mao Zedong.

Vice Chairman Zhu De then spoke at the reception. On behalf of the Chinese government and people, he extended warm congratulations to the government and people of the Republic of Indonesia.

Vice Chairman Zhu De said that in recent years, the Indonesian people have made great achievements in strengthening national unity, developing the national economy, and safeguarding their sovereignty and independence, and have made important contributions to promoting the unity of Asian and African countries and defending Asian and world peace. In the past year, the Indonesian people, together with the people of Asian and African countries, have actively opposed colonialism and supported and assisted the national independence movements in Asia and Africa, which fully demonstrates the strength and role of the unity of the Asian and African people.

Vice Chairman Zhu De also said that the friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian people, as President Sukarno said, is a brotherly friendship, a fighting friendship. Then he talked about the growing development of friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries in various fields in recent years. He said that President Sukarno's friendly visit to China last year left a deep impression on the Chinese people. We firmly believe that the friendship between China and Indonesia, developed on the basis of the Bandung Conference resolutions, will continue to be strengthened and consolidated.

At the end of his speech, he proposed a toast to the health of President Sukarno.

During the banquet, the hosts and guests constantly toasted to the eternal friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian people, to the prosperity and strength of the two countries and the happiness of the people, and to lasting world peace.

Polish Ambassador to China, Kirilo, on behalf of the diplomatic envoys of various countries in China, expressed warm congratulations to the Republic of Indonesia.

Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Guo Moruo, Vice Premier Chen Yi, Vice Minister Zhang Wentian, responsible persons from various departments of the state leading organs, and well-known figures from all walks of life attended tonight's reception.

Diplomatic envoys of various countries to China also attended the reception.

    维约普拉诺托大使举行招待会
    庆祝印度尼西亚独立十二周年
    新华社17日讯  印度尼西亚驻华大使维约普拉诺托今晚举行招待会，庆祝印度尼西亚共和国独立十二周年。
    朱德副主席出席了招待会。
    维约普拉诺托大使在招待会开始时讲话，向来宾们表示感谢。
    维约普拉诺托说，印度尼西亚的革命是一个全面性的而且是同时进行的革命，它是要在生活的各个方面进行。首先，印度尼西亚革命是民族革命，就是要从殖民者手中争取独立；并以民族经济来充实这个民族独立。此外，印度尼西亚革命也是社会革命，它要消除人民的贫穷，建立一个正义的、繁荣的社会。最后，印度尼西亚的革命是文化革命，是要建立适合于我们自己生活方式的新的文化。由于革命是全面性而且要一致进行的，因此实现起来显然是繁重的，不是短期间所能完成的。但是不管印度尼西亚民族现在和将来所面临的斗争是多么繁重，由于印度尼西亚民族坚强的意志，印度尼西亚民族将安全度过上述各种革命，最后必将获得胜利。
    他又说，印度尼西亚在对外关系方面，是执行被称为独立自主的政策。这种政策是跟中立政策不同的，因为印度尼西亚经常积极参加保卫世界和平、消除国际紧张的事业。在反抗帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争中，印度尼西亚总是积极的。有人把印度尼西亚的独立自主的政策说成是没有道德性的。这完全不对的。印度尼西亚的独立自主政策是印度尼西亚民族道义观念的表现，是东方国家的道德观念的表现。
    他在讲话结束时，提议为毛泽东主席的健康干杯。
    朱德副主席接着在招待会上讲话。他代表中国政府和人民，向印度尼西亚共和国政府和人民致以热烈的祝贺。
    朱德副主席说，近几年来，印度尼西亚人民在加强民族团结，发展民族经济和维护自己的主权和独立方面取得了很大的成就，并为促进亚非国家的团结、保卫亚洲和世界和平做出了重要的贡献。近一年来，印度尼西亚人民和亚非各国人民一道，积极反对殖民主义，支持和声援亚非地区的民族独立运动，这充分地显示了亚非人民团结的力量和作用。
    朱德副主席又说，中国和印度尼西亚两国人民之间的友谊，正如苏加诺总统所说的是兄弟的友谊，战斗的友谊。接着他谈到了近年来，两国在各个方面的友好合作关系的日益发展情况。他说，苏加诺总统去年对中国的友好访问，在中国人民的心中留下了深刻的印象。我们深信，中国和印度尼西亚两国在万隆会议决议的基础上所发展起来的友谊将不断地得到加强和巩固。
    他在讲话结束时提议为苏加诺总统的健康干杯。
    席间，宾主不断互为中国和印度尼西亚两国人民的永恒的友谊，为两国的繁荣富强和人民的幸福，为世界的持久和平而干杯。
    波兰驻华大使基里洛克代表各国驻华使节团向印度尼西亚共和国表示了热烈祝贺。
    郭沫若副委员长、陈毅副总理、张闻天副部长和国家领导机关各部门负责人、各界著名人士出席了今晚的招待会。
    各国驻华使节也出席了招待会。
