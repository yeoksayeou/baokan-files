    Organized Special Teams, Adopted Joint Operations
    Fujian Local Organizations of Various Democratic Parties
    Achieve Major Victory in the Anti-Rightist Struggle
    (New China News Agency Dispatch) The anti-rightist struggle of the local organizations of various democratic parties in Fujian Province has achieved a major victory.
    In nearly two months, members of various parties, either independently or together with their institutions and schools, have successively exposed and criticized the anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds of He Gonggan, member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League and Deputy Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Committee; Li Shuzhong, Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party; Liu Dongye, Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association; and Li Lizhou, member of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, and other rightist backbone elements.
    In the struggle, various democratic parties sent capable personnel to support the grassroots, and adopted various methods such as joint operations by various parties and the establishment of special teams based on industries and the scope of activities of rightist elements to carry out the struggle simultaneously, thus enabling this struggle to be carried out rapidly, universally, and deeply. He Gonggan, a veteran rightist who had conspired with rightist ringleaders Chen Mingshu, Zhang Bojun, and Luo Longji in Beijing to launch a frenzied attack on the Communist Party and socialism, initially refused to confess his crimes. At this time, the Fujian Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League immediately convened a meeting attended by members of various parties to launch a critical struggle against He Gonggan, forcing him to admit the facts in the face of a large number of facts. Li Shuzhong, the resolute executor of the anti-Party and anti-socialist program of the Zhang-Luo alliance in Fujian, also attempted to muddle through. However, under the joint operations of the special team jointly organized by the Fujian Provincial Committee and Fuzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party and other aspects, the strongholds of this rightist group headed by Li Shuzhong, which were distributed in Fujian Normal University, Fujian Agricultural College, the Provincial Department of Industry, the Traditional Chinese Medicine Continuing Education School, and Quanzhou, Zhangzhou, and other places, were exposed one by one.
    At present, the anti-rightist struggle of various democratic parties is continuing to deepen and spread with full confidence.

    组织专门小组　采取联合作战
    各民主党派福建地方组织
    反右派斗争取得重大胜利
    本报讯　各民主党派福建省地方组织反对资产阶级右派分子的斗争已经取得重大胜利。
    在近两个月的时间中，各党派成员单独或者和机关、学校一起先后揭发和批判了民盟中央委员、福建省副主任委员何公敢，农工民主党福建省主任委员李述中，民建福建省主任委员刘栋业和民革福建省委委员李黎洲等右派骨干分子反党反社会主义的言行。
    在斗争中，各民主党派派出得力人员支援基层，以及采取各党派联合作战和按行业、按右派分子活动范围成立专门小组同时开展斗争等多种方法，因而使这一斗争能迅速普遍而深入地开展起来。曾在北京和右派头子陈铭枢、章伯钧、罗隆基一起策划向共产党、向社会主义展开猖狂进攻的老牌右派分子何公敢，开始时，拒不坦白交代。这时，民盟福建省委立即召开了有各党派成员参加的会议，向何公敢展开批判斗争，使他在大量事实面前不得不低头承认。章、罗联盟反党反社会主义纲领在福建的坚决执行人李述中，原来也是妄图蒙混过关。但在农工党福建省委、福州市委联合组织的专门小组等几个方面的联合作战下，终于把这个以李述中为首的右派集团分布在福建师范学院、福建农学院、省工业厅、中医进修学校和泉州、漳州等地的据点一一揭露了出来。
    现在，各民主党派的反右派斗争正信心百倍地继续深入而普遍地展开。
