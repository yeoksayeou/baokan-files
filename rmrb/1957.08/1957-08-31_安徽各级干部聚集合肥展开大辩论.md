　　Anhui Cadres at All Levels Gather in Hefei to Launch a Major Debate

　　(Our dispatch) Anhui province’s responsible cadres at all levels are adopting a gentle and gradual approach to conduct self-education on the two roads, overcoming erroneous thinking that exists among some leading cadres, in order to prepare for carrying out large-scale socialist education in rural areas. This self-education is being conducted at the four-level cadre conference convened by the Anhui Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. Attending this conference were the responsible party and government officials of the province, special districts, cities, and counties, district party committee secretaries, as well as the responsible cadres of various factories, mines, universities, colleges, and provincial directly-affiliated organizations, totaling more than one thousand people.

　　The method of conducting this conference is very different from before. It neither issued documents nor made reports, but instead, the Provincial Party Committee, focusing on the central topic in the Central Committee's instructions on conducting socialist education for the rural population, combined with the province's situation, put forward twelve major topics for discussion, allowing everyone to discuss and offer opinions, and then conduct a major debate. The issues debated mainly included: whether cooperatives have advantages, whether collectivization was too fast; whether the unified purchase and sale methods of grain, oil, cotton, etc. are good, and what are the reasons for the slow progress of summer grain procurement this year; what problems have arisen in promoting agricultural production reform, and what opinions are there; whether the gap between workers' and peasants' lives is large; what are the ideological biases within the Party in rural areas currently, and what kind of thinking should be struggled against in rural areas, and so on. The debate has now entered a climax and is continuing. (Yu Ming)

　　安徽各级干部聚集合肥展开大辩论
    本报讯　安徽省各级负责干部，正在采取和风细雨的办法，进行着两条道路的自我教育，克服在一些领导干部中存在的错误思想，为在农村开展大规模的社会主义教育作准备。这种自我教育，是在中共安徽省委召开的四级干部会议上进行的。出席这次会议的有省、专、市、县的党政负责人，区委书记，以及各厂矿、大专学校、省直属机关负责干部共一千多人。
    这次会议的进行方式，和以前有很大不同。既没有发文件，又没有作报告，而是由省委围绕中共中央关于向农村人口进行社会主义教育指示中的中心题目，结合本省的情况，提出了十二个大讨论题，让大家讨论，提意见，然后进行大辩论。辩论的问题主要包括：合作社是否有优越性，合作化是否太快了；粮、油、棉花等的统购统销办法好不好，今年夏粮征购进度缓慢的原因是什么；在推行农业生产改革中出了什么毛病，有什么意见；工农生活是否差别大；目前农村中党内的思想偏向是什么，农村中应该对什么思想进行斗争等等。目前辩论已进入高潮，正继续进行中。　（于明）
