Harbin Trade Union Cadres Criticize Sun Nairu

　　(Our dispatch) Harbin Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and workers from municipal industrial unions exposed the anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks of Sun Nairu, a rightist element and cadre in the Wage Department of the First Machine Industry Trade Union.

　　Sun Nairu said: Without the leadership of the Party, the masses can also liberate themselves and take the socialist road. He claimed that the trade union also has a monotonous flavor, and that democratic figures should also participate in the leadership of the trade union, attempting to tamper with the nature of the trade union organization.

　　哈市工会干部批判孙乃儒
　　本报讯　哈尔滨市工会联合会和市级各产业工会工作者揭露了第一机械工会工资部干部右派分子孙乃儒的反共反社会主义言论。
    孙乃儒说：没有党的领导群众也可以解放自己，也会走社会主义道路。说什么工会也有清一色味道，工会也应该有民主人士来参加领导，企图这样来篡改工会组织的性质。
