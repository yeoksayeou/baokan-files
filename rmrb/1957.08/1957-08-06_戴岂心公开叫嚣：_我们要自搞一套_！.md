Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 4th. Shanghai Aquatic Products College recently exposed an insidious and vicious anti-socialist, anti-Party leadership clique, headed by Dai Qixin, chairman of the Jiu San Society branch and professor in the Aquatic Product Processing Department of the Aquatic Products College.

As early as 1952, not long after Dai Qixin was transferred to the Aquatic Products College, he colluded with some people dissatisfied with the Party to form an anti-Party clique.

During the recent "blooming and contending," Dai Qixin said at a joint meeting of the Jiu San Society and the China Democratic League: "The reason why the Aquatic Products College has problems is mainly because the Party committee's leadership is not good." "We want to start our own system."

Dai Qixin slandered the two deputy secretaries of the Party committee, saying, "They can only take care of children at home." He repeatedly provoked and enticed Vice President Liu (a non-Party member) to "confront the Party"; when he failed to entice him, he immediately put on a ferocious face and scolded Vice President Liu, even saying arrogantly, "If Liu doesn't do what I want, I will show him great democracy."

Dai Qixin even exclaimed triumphantly: "My purpose is to control the Aquatic Products College behind the scenes, to turn the Aquatic Products College into a school of a capitalist nature, to be directed by me, Dai Qixin."

In order to control the leadership of the Aquatic Products College, Dai Qixin and others also focused their attacks on the personnel department, first spreading rumors and slandering that "the personnel department is very chaotic, very bad," "the main contradiction of the school is in the personnel department," and then planted his pawns into the personnel handling group established during the rectification movement, saying, "We are judges. We want to judge the head of the personnel department in the posture of judges." He shouted, "The head of the ×× section must be replaced immediately. The ideological reform and anti-rebellion files must be made public." Saying "personnel transfers must go through the trade union." In fact, Dai Qixin had long had a "cabinet formation plan," who would hold what position, who would be in charge of what, all planned out, only lacking the position of the head of the personnel department. But he once said to others: "Can't the head of the personnel department be filled by a non-Party person?" Of the 21 teaching and research groups in the entire college, 18 were controlled by the Dai Qixin clique.

In this anti-rightist struggle, after the teachers and students of the whole school exposed Dai Qixin's ferocious face, Dai Qixin tried his best to quibble, saying: "It doesn't matter, my friends have studied it, the law of the Communist Party is that it starts with great fanfare, and ends silently." Luo Qirong, one of the backbone members of this anti-Party clique, followed orders and played rogue tricks, openly clamoring, "I just refuse to confess, resist to the end," "You can cut off my head."

The stubborn attitude of rightists such as Dai Qixin aroused the extreme indignation of the faculty and staff of the college. They expressed to Dai Qixin, the head of this anti-Party clique: "If you don't surrender in a year, we will fight you for a year. If you resist for a lifetime, we will fight you for a lifetime!"

    戴岂心公开叫嚣：
    “我们要自搞一套”！
    据新华社上海4日电　上海水产学院最近揭发出一个阴险毒辣的反社会主义、反对党的领导的小集团，这个集团的头子是水产学院九三学社支社主任委员、水产加工系教授戴岂心。
    早在1952年戴岂心调来水产学院不久，他就纠结一些对党不满的人形成反党小集团。
    在这次“鸣”“放”中，戴岂心在九三、民盟的联席会上，他说：“水产学院之所以有问题，主要是党委领导不行。”“我们要自搞一套。”
    戴岂心诽谤党委两位副书记说：“只能在家里带孩子。”他几次挑拨引诱刘副院长（非党员）“与党抗衡”；及至引诱不成，他即马上摆出狰狞面孔骂刘副院长，甚至狂妄地说：“刘如不照我的意思做，要搞大民主给他看。”
    戴岂心甚至得意忘形地叫道：“我的目的就是要在幕后控制水产学院，要变水产学院为资本主义性质的学校，要由我戴岂心指挥。”
    为了控制水产学院的领导权，戴岂心等又集中攻击人事科，先造谣污蔑“人事科乱得很，糟得很”，“学校主要矛盾在人事科”，然后把他的爪牙打入整风中成立的人事处理小组，说什么“我们是法官。我们要以审判者的姿态审判人事科长。”大叫“要立即撤换××科长。要公开思想改造与肃反档案材料”。说什么“人员调动一定要通过工会”。事实上，戴岂心早有一个“组阁计划”，谁任什么职务，谁抓什么，都计划好了，只缺人事科长一职。但是他曾向人说过：“人事科长难道不能由非党人士充任么？”全院二十一个教研组，被戴岂心集团控制的就有十八个。
    在这次反右派斗争中，全校师生揭露了戴岂心的凶恶面目以后，戴岂心百般狡赖，他说：“不要紧，我的朋友研究过，共产党的规律是开始大张旗鼓，最后就无声无息了。”这个反党小集团骨干分子之一的骆启荣遵命大耍无赖手段，公然叫嚣“我就是拒不交代，顽抗到底”，“杀我的头也可以”。
    戴岂心等右派分子的顽抗态度，激起了学院教职员工的万分愤慨，他们向这个反党小集团的头子戴岂心表示说：“你一年不投降，斗你一年，你顽抗一辈子，就斗你一辈子！”
