Xinhua News Agency, 15th dispatch: Can Zhang Naiqi's work in the Ministry of Food really stand inspection? At the criticism meeting against Zhang Naiqi held at the Ministry of Food on the 14th and 15th, this question received a negative answer.

How did Zhang Naiqi conduct his leadership work in the Ministry of Food? Huang Nantian from the Scientific Research Institute revealed that Zhang Naiqi once said to him in April this year: "I personally only manage the principles, and don't manage the specific matters." Zhang Naiqi also said smugly that his leadership method can be summarized as "less management, more checking." Huang Nantian pointed out that Zhang Naiqi's boasted so-called "leadership art" is not doing work but only finding faults, and in essence, it is his strategy to attack the Party and socialism.

Huang Nantian said that Zhang Naiqi always attributed the achievements in work to himself and pushed the mistakes and shortcomings to others. For example, Zhang Naiqi has always boasted of the achievements of the "Four-Nos" granary campaign across the country as his own merit. In fact, the "Four-Nos" granary movement was launched based on the experience of insect-free granaries in Yuhang, Zhejiang, mold-free granaries in Xiangang, Guangdong, and Ningwu, Shanxi. The emergence of these insect-free and mold-free granaries should be attributed to the attention, support, and assistance of local Party and government leading organs, the efforts of granary staff, and the personal identification and assistance of Soviet experts. What reason does Zhang Naiqi have to count this merit on himself?

Liang Zhuhang, Director of the Planning Department, listed facts to illustrate that Zhang Naiqi's self-proclaimed "leadership art" was nothing more than demagoguery, sowing discord, attacking Communist Party members, and engaging in anti-communist activities.

Liang Zhuhang said: In June 1956, when Zhang Naiqi inspected work in Zhejiang, he asked the food bureaus of Jinhua, Wenzhou, Qingtian, and other places to further relax the grain sales targets that could already meet the people's food needs, in order to establish his personal authority. After Zhang Naiqi started this fire, it caused ideological confusion in the grain departments of these places, which made the work of the Zhejiang Provincial Grain Department and the Ministry of Food difficult. Liang Zhuhang said that Zhang Naiqi often boasted of his talent and took credit for the achievements of grain work. Over the past few years, grain work has made achievements, but this is the result of the efforts of 800,000 grain work cadres and 600 million people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. And over the past few years, which major policy or measure in grain work was proposed and arranged by Zhang Naiqi? None! Usually, when he presides over meetings, he often doesn't say responsible things, always engaging in empty talk.

Wang Youshan, Director of the Purchasing and Storage Bureau, and scientific and technical personnel Zhang Jia, Zhang Xiyang, He Xianzhi, Pan Duo, and others revealed the truth about Zhang Naiqi's so-called "importance of science and care for scientists" with specific facts. Wang Youshan said that Zhang Naiqi was in charge of leading scientific research work in the Ministry of Food, but he fundamentally did not implement the Party's policy of "scientific research work should be carried out in a planned manner, with key development and corresponding consideration," nor did he ever propose tasks related to grain scientific research based on the current specific situation, but blindly and unrealistically arranged experiments. For example, in 1953, he happened to see a news item in the Ta Kung Pao about drying grain with infrared rays, and he ordered the East China Grain Bureau to experiment; in fact, this method is not suitable for the current situation in China. In terms of the design of basic construction projects, in 1955, he happened to hear a cadre say that the simple warehouse built with bamboo in Jinhua was very economical and durable, and he immediately instructed the Infrastructure Bureau to design it. After investigation by the Infrastructure Bureau, this did not happen, it was just the cadre's idea.

He Xianzhi said that Zhang Naiqi had vigorously advocated promoting "rice husk feeding pigs." The meeting of animal husbandry experts convened by the Ministry of Food unanimously believed that the crude fiber content of rice husks was too high and not suitable for feed, but Zhang Naiqi said self-righteously at the meeting: "People can still eat rice husks!" He still insisted on promoting this method.

They also pointed out in their speeches that Zhang Naiqi's so-called care for scientists is a deceptive lie. Zhang Naiqi has always adopted a combination of "hitting" and "pulling" tactics towards scientists, that is, "those who obey me will prosper, and those who oppose me will perish." Huang Zhiqiu, whom Zhang Naiqi fully supported in the Ministry of Food and praised as the "science of the Ministry of Food," is a rightist who has always been dissatisfied with the Communist Party and has been frantically attacking the Party. His technical level is very low, and even the ordinary dryer he designed cannot be used. He ordered instruments for the grain department from abroad, but bought instruments for steel plants and power plants. However, Zhang Naiqi wanted to promote him and increase his salary, and also attempted to appoint him as the "consultant" of the Ministry of Food or the leader of the Scientific Research Institute. On the contrary, Zhang Naiqi not only did not support scientific and technical personnel who insisted on correct opinions and earnestly carried out research work, but also attacked them. For example, because Xiong Deshao and Zhang Ziyi disagreed with Zhang Naiqi's opinion on "rice husk feeding pigs," Zhang Naiqi scolded them for "not having the attitude of scientists," for "deliberately acting against their will," and for "wanting to flatter the administrative leaders." For example, in the design process of the Xinlan Flour Mill, in order to avoid dust flying when wheat enters the warehouse and affecting the health of workers, engineer He Xianzhi researched a "wheat pneumatic suction and conveying machine" suitable for the Chinese situation. Zhang Naiqi did not support it, but said: "This kind of brainpower can be avoided. The Soviet Union has many methods. Just import some!" In fact, the Soviet Union did not have this kind of machine.

The meeting will be adjourned for one day tomorrow, and will continue to be held afterwards.

### 不做工作  专找岔子  哗众取宠  挑拨离间  章乃器在粮食部的工作原来如此

    不做工作  专找岔子  哗众取宠  挑拨离间
    章乃器在粮食部的工作原来如此
    新华社15日讯  章乃器在粮食部的工作真的经得起检查吗？在粮食部14、15两天举行的批判章乃器大会，这个问题得到了否定的回答。
    章乃器在粮食部是怎样进行领导工作的呢？科学研究所的黄南田揭发，章乃器在今年4月曾对他说过：“我个人只管原则，具体事情不管。”章乃器还自鸣得意地说，他这个领导方法，概括起来就叫做“少管多查”。黄南田指出，章乃器吹嘘的“少管多查”的所谓“领导艺术”，就是不做工作，专找岔子，实质上就是他向党向社会主义进攻的策略。
    黄南田说，章乃器一向把工作中的成绩算在自己账上，把错误和缺点推给别人。例如，章乃器一向把全国开展“四无”粮仓的成绩夸耀成他的功劳。实际上，四无粮仓运动是根据浙江余杭无虫粮仓、广东岘岗和山西宁武无霉粮仓的经验开展起来的，这些无虫和无霉粮仓的出现，应当归功于当地党政领导机关的重视、支持和帮助，归功于粮仓工作人员的努力，归功于苏联专家的亲自鉴定和帮助，章乃器有什么理由把这一功劳算在自己账上呢？
    计划司司长梁竹航列举事实说明章乃器自己吹嘘的所谓“领导艺术”，只不过是哗众取宠，挑拨离间，打击共产党员，进行反共活动吧了。
    梁竹航说：1956年6月，章乃器到浙江视察工作，要金华、温州、青田等地粮食局把已能满足人民食用的粮食销售指标再放宽，借此树立他个人的权威。章乃器烧了这一把火以后，引起了这些地方的粮食部门思想混乱，使浙江省粮食厅和粮食部的工作发生困难。梁竹航说，章乃器经常自负才华，以粮食工作的成绩居功。几年来粮食工作是有成绩的，但这是在中国共产党的领导下，八十万粮食工作干部和六亿人民努力的结果。而几年来，粮食工作中有那一项重大政策、措施是章乃器提出、布置的呢？没有！平时，他主持会议，常常不说负责任的话，总是清谈。
    采储局局长王有山和科学技术人员张佳、张锡羊、何献芝、潘铎等人以具体事实揭露了章乃器所谓“重视科学、爱护科学家”的真相。王有山说，章乃器在粮食部分工领导科学研究工作，但是他根本没有贯彻党的“科学研究工作要有计划地进行，重点发展，相应照顾”的方针，也从来没有根据当前具体情况提出有关粮食科学研究的任务，而是盲目地，脱离实际地布置试验。例如1953年他偶然看到大公报上一个用红外线烘干粮食的消息，便下令华东粮食局试验；实际上，这种办法根本不适合目前中国的情况。在基本建设工程的设计方面，1955年他偶然听到一个干部说金华用竹子建成的简易仓库很经济耐用，他即指示基建局进行设计。后经基建局调查并没有这件事，只是那个干部设想而已。
    何献芝说，章乃器曾竭力主张推广“砻糠喂猪”，粮食部召开的畜牧专家会议一致认为砻糠的粗纤维含量过高，不宜作饲料，可是章乃器在会上自以为是地说：“人还能吃砻糠呢！”仍然坚持推广这一办法。
    他们在发言中还指出章乃器的所谓爱护科学家是骗人的鬼话。章乃器对科学家一直是采取“打”和“拉”相结合的技俩，也就是“顺我者昌，逆我者亡”。章乃器在粮食部全力支持并誉之为“粮食部的科学”的黄志秋，是一个一向对共产党不满和疯狂进攻党的右派分子。他的技术水平很低，设计的普通烘干机都不能用，向国外订购粮食部门的仪器，却买来了钢铁厂、发电厂用的仪器。但是章乃器却要替他提级加薪，还企图委派他当粮食部的“顾问”或者科学研究所的领导人。相反地章乃器对坚持正确意见、认真进行研究工作的科学技术人员不但不支持而且加以打击。例如熊德邵和张子仪因为不同意章乃器关于“砻糠喂猪”的意见，章乃器就骂他们“没有科学家的态度”，是“故作违心之论”，是“想拍行政领导的马屁”。又如在新兰面粉厂的设计过程中，工程师何献芝为了避免小麦入库时尘土飞扬，影响工人健康，就研究了一种适合于中国情况的“小麦风动吸运机”，章乃器不予支持，却说：“这种脑筋可以不要动，苏联有的是办法，进口一些就行啦！”实际上苏联并没有这种机器。
    会议明天休会一天，以后仍将继续举行。
