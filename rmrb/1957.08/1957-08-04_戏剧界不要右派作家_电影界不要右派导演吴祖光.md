The theatrical and film circles in the capital, at a forum jointly convened by the Chinese Dramatists Association and the China Film Workers Association on August 2, continued to expose and criticize the rightist words and deeds of playwright and film director Wu Zuguang. In Wu Zuguang's writing:
    The new society is actually "full of murderous intent,"
    But the old society was "full of vitality."
In his speech at the Second Rectification Forum of the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles on May 31 (see "Drama News," Issue 14) and in his article "Talking About the Backstage" in the August issue of "Drama Script Monthly," Wu Zuguang not only negated the literary and artistic endeavors led by the Party but also viciously attacked the great achievements of the Party and the state in various construction undertakings. He said: "I have lived to be forty years old, and I have never seen such chaos as in the last few years." He cited "never before has there been such 'confusion of right and wrong,' 'unclear responsibilities,' young leaders leading the old, amateurs leading experts, the most mass-based party being separated from the masses." As evidence of "chaos," he viciously said that the Party's promotion of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" was "just to quell the chaos." He slandered the Party for "encouraging not working for food, encouraging laziness," saying, "This is the evil consequence of the organizational system." He further scolded that "the organizational system is stupid" and told the Party to "stop leading artistic work as soon as possible." He also distorted the great significance of the Party's policy toward intellectuals and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, saying, "Even in the era of autocracy, the method of struggle such as suppressing counter-revolutionaries is a crime." In the article "Talking About the Backstage," he described the backstage of the new society as "full of murderous intent" and "a scene of 'war about to break out'"; while the backstage of the old society, with its harsh working conditions and rampant secret agents, was described as "life there was so vibrant and so colorful." Wu Zuguang even slandered today's society, where the people are the masters, saying that it "has so many similarities to the 'polite society' that I mentioned in 1943 (i.e., the society ruled by Chiang Kai-shek), and it is even difficult to see 'the truth' in dramas."
    At the forum, Cai Chusheng, chairman of the China Film Workers Association, pointed out that Wu Zuguang's rightist remarks had a fairly widespread impact in the art world. If we coexist peacefully with such remarks and deeds, it will lead our cause onto the tragic road of capitalist restoration. He asked those present to refute and expose Wu Zuguang mercilessly from all aspects, draw clear political and ideological boundaries, and fight to the end.

Tian Han Analyzes Wu Zuguang
    Somewhat Like the "Belikov" Who Loathes Progress,
    But He is a "Belikov" Attacking the Party
    Tian Han, chairman of the Chinese Dramatists Association, after briefly introducing the previous stage of criticism of Wu Zuguang's erroneous thinking and the Party's utmost help to him, exposed Wu Zuguang's shameful double-dealing tactics. He said: Wu Zuguang pretended to be sincere, talking to many people and writing self-criticisms in an attempt to muddle through; but behind his back, he continued to publish fallacies and even wanted to retaliate against those who helped him correct his mistakes. After analyzing the path of Wu Zuguang's anti-Party and anti-socialist thought development, Tian Han said that some people said that he was like Chekhov's "The Man in a Case," Belikov, who loathed progress, loathed new things, wore galoshes on sunny days, looked backward and not forward. Tian Han said that although he was somewhat like Belikov, he was not such a passive character, but an "active element" who viciously attacked the new society and the Party that led the society forward. Tian Han refuted Wu Zuguang's open attacks in the forums of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, in "Drama News," "Drama Script Monthly," etc., and also exposed the two cold arrows shot by Wu Zuguang in the "Wenhui Daily" at the end of last year and in February of this year. That is, in "Speaking Up for a Kind Old Lady," Wu Zuguang attacked the new society for being inhuman, to the point of saying that "liberation is a synonym for ruthlessness," and in "General Dropped His Gun," Wu Zuguang attacked today's new audience for being tolerant of the theater school students who "dropped their guns." He said: "We really should do our work well. When people realize that doting is a sin, they will kick unqualified actors off the stage." The so-called unqualified actors, according to Wu Zuguang himself, refer to communists.
    Finally, Tian Han advocated that Wu Zuguang should not be pampered any longer. He has become a person hostile to the people and should be allowed to make a thorough confession.

Several Veteran Dramatists Demonstrate Specifically:
    Our Country's Dramatic Cause Has Gained International Reputation,
    And Wu Zuguang is Not Allowed to Describe it as a Complete Mess
    Veteran dramatists Ouyang Yuqian, Cao Yu, Yang Hansheng, Chen Baichen, Chen Qitong, etc., with concrete demonstrations, sternly refuted the slanders made by Wu Zuguang against the Party's literary and artistic cause, organizational system, the Party's policy toward intellectuals, and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. Ouyang Yuqian first cited the leading comrades in literature, drama, fine arts, and film to refute Wu Zuguang's nonsense about amateurs leading experts. He also said that the outstanding achievements of the dramatic cause led by the Party have been unanimously praised by many internationally renowned dramatists. He said that he had spent decades in the drama world, but the achievements of the past few years since liberation were beyond his reach in the past. Wu Zuguang described the Party's cause as a complete mess, even worse than the Kuomintang, which could not but make people feel extremely angry. Ouyang Shanzun cited the specific situation of the backstage of the Beijing People's Art Theater, which was not the "murderous" atmosphere described by Wu Zuguang, but a backstage that provided actors with good artistic creation conditions and had close ties with the audience. In order to allow Wu Zuguang to go backstage at any time, the theater also gave him an access card. However, Wu Zuguang lied against his conscience. Yan Yong, principal of the China Opera School, also used practical examples from their school to powerfully shatter Wu Zuguang's fallacy that the new society has not cultivated talents.

Wu Zuguang's Literary History View:
    Future Chinese Literary History Should Call the Present
    The Era of Formulaic and Conceptualized Literature
    At the forum, Wang Ming, Lu En, Fang Guande, and others used concrete facts to expose Wu Zuguang's ugly double-dealing activities over the years and since the rectification movement. Wang Ming, who was once a member of Wu Zuguang's "small group," revealed that Wu Zuguang's home was a gathering place for rumors and gossip. Wang Ming said that Wu Zuguang was not accustomed to all the systems and new things of the new society and opposed all political movements. He said, "Movements hurt people's hearts the most and can only make people laugh when they meet. They dare not say anything real." When Wang Ming was subjected to organizational review in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and a conclusion was made, he explained to Wu Zuguang his gratitude to the Communist Party. Wu Zuguang said, "Good, you should say thank you to you and ask you to rectify us again to let you have your fill." Wu Zuguang said, "In the new society, when a person has achieved something, he always hypocritically says 'the Party leads well.' Life itself is formulaic and conceptualized, no wonder the works are also formulaic and conceptualized." He believed that future Chinese literary history should call the present "the era of formulaic and conceptualized literature."
    Liu Zhiming, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Culture, called on everyone in the drama and film circles to participate in this struggle, further expose and criticize Wu Zuguang's words and deeds, and thoroughly defeat the rightists, smashing their various anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist activities.

    戏剧界不要右派作家  电影界不要右派导演吴祖光
    本报讯　首都戏剧和电影界人士，8月2日在中国戏剧家协会和中国电影工作者联谊会联合召开的座谈会上，继续揭发和批判剧作家、电影导演吴祖光的右派言行。在吴祖光的笔下：
    新社会竟是“杀气腾腾”
    旧社会却是“生气勃勃”
    吴祖光在5月31日全国文联第二次整风座谈会上的发言中，（见戏剧报第十四期）和剧本月刊8月号的“谈后台”文中，不只是对党所领导的文艺事业，还对党和国家的各项建设事业的巨大成就，都加以否定，并进行恶毒的攻击。他说：“我活到四十岁了，从没看到像这几年这样乱过。”他举出“过去从来没有像这样‘是非不分’‘职责不清’，年轻的领导年老的，外行领导内行，无能领导有能，最有群众基础的党脱离了群众”。作为“乱”的证据，恶毒地说党提倡“百花齐放，百家争鸣，就是为了平乱”。他污蔑党“鼓励不劳而食，鼓励懒惰，”说“这就是组织制度的恶果”。他更进一步地谩骂“组织制度是愚蠢的”，要党“趁早别领导艺术工作。”他还歪曲党的知识分子政策和肃反运动的巨大意义；说什么“肃反这种斗争方式，即使在专制时代，也都是罪恶的。”在“谈后台”一文中，他把新社会的后台说成是“杀气腾腾”，“有‘大战一触即发’的光景”；而把旧社会工作条件恶劣，宪警特务横行的后台却描写为“那里的生活是那样生气勃勃，那样色彩丰富。”吴祖光甚至毁谤今天人民当家作主的社会，和他“在1943年所提到的‘多礼的社会’（即蒋介石统治的社会）还有这么多相似的地方，甚至于在戏剧里也难得看到‘真话’”。
    在座谈会上，中国电影工作者联谊会主席蔡楚生指出吴祖光的右派言论，在艺术界的影响是相当广泛的，如果我们和这种言行和平共处，将会把我们的事业带上资本主义复辟的悲惨道路。他要求到会的人，从各方面来对吴祖光加以无情的驳斥和揭发，划清政治界限、思想界限，斗争到底。田汉解剖吴祖光
    有点像厌恶进步的“别里科夫”
    但他是向党进攻的“别里科夫”
    中国戏剧家协会主席田汉在简单地介绍了前一阶段对吴祖光错误思想批判的经过，和党对他的仁至义尽的帮助后，揭发了吴祖光可耻的两面派手法。他说：吴祖光一面假装诚恳，找许多人谈话，并写检讨企图蒙混过关；而在背后却继续发表谬论，甚至想对帮助他改正错误的人进行报复。田汉在分析吴祖光反党反社会主义思想发展的径路后说，有人说他像契诃夫写的“装在套子里的人”别里科夫那样，厌恶进步，厌恶新鲜事物，在晴天穿雨鞋，向后看不向前看。田汉说他虽有点像别里科夫，他却不是那样消极的人物，而是向新社会，向领导社会前进的党恶毒进攻的“积极分子”。田汉批驳了吴祖光在文联座谈会，在戏剧报、剧本月刊等投出的明枪之外，还揭发了发表吴祖光在去年年底和今年2月间的文汇报上射出的两枝冷箭。即在“为一位好心的老太太叫屈”中，吴祖光攻击新社会不近人情，以至说“解放是无情的代名词”，又在“将军失手掉了枪”中，吴祖光攻击今天新观众对“失手掉了枪”的戏校学生的宽容。说：“我们的工作实在应该好好地干了。当人们发觉溺爱是罪恶的时候他们会把不称职的演员捅下台来的。”所谓不称职的演员，据吴祖光自己说就是指共产党人。
    最后田汉主张对吴祖光不能再溺爱了。他已经成为和人民敌对的人了，应该让他彻底交代。几位老戏剧家具体论证：
    我国戏剧事业获得了国际声誉
    不容吴祖光把它说得一团漆黑
    老戏剧家欧阳予倩、曹禺、阳翰笙、陈白尘、陈其通等以具体的论证严厉驳斥了吴祖光对党的文艺事业、组织制度、党的知识分子政策、和肃反运动所进行的污蔑。欧阳予倩首先举出文学、戏剧、美术、电影方面的领导同志驳斥了吴祖光外行领导内行的谰言。他又说，党领导的戏剧事业的优异成就，已获得许多国际上著名戏剧家一致的称赞。他说他在戏剧界过了几十年，而解放后这几年来的成就却是他过去可望而不可及的。吴祖光把党的事业说得一团漆黑，甚至说得比国民党还坏，不能不使人无比愤怒。欧阳山尊举出北京人民艺术剧院后台具体情况，并不像吴祖光所形容的“杀气腾腾”，而是一个使演员有良好的艺术创造条件，同时和观众有密切联系的后台。为了让吴祖光能够随时去后台，剧院还给过他一枚出入证。可是，吴祖光却昧良心说假话。中国戏曲学校校长晏甬也用他们学校的实际例子，有力地粉碎了吴祖光说新社会没有培养出人才的谬论。吴祖光的文学史观：
    将来的中国文学史应该把现在
    叫做公式化概念化的文学时代
    座谈会上，汪明、吕恩、方琯德等用具体的事实揭穿了吴祖光多年来，以及整风运动以来丑恶的两面派活动。曾是吴祖光的“小集团”成员之一的汪明揭发吴祖光的家里是一个流言蜚语聚散地。汪明说，吴祖光看不惯新社会的一切制度和新事物，反对历次政治运动，他说“运动最伤人心，只能使人见面哈哈哈，什么真话也不敢说”。当汪明在肃反中受到组织审查做了结论，对吴祖光说明他感激共产党的心情时，吴祖光却说，“好呵，你该说感谢你们，请你们再整我们一次，让你过过瘾”。吴祖光说，“新社会一个人作了事有成绩，总要虚伪地说‘党领导的好’，生活本身就是公式化、概念化的，难怪作品也公式化概念化”。他认为将来的中国文学史应把现在叫作“公式化概念化文学时代”。
    文化部刘芝明副部长要求戏剧电影界人人参加这个斗争。进一步揭发和批判吴祖光的言行，彻底打垮右派分子。击破他们的各种各色反党、反人民、反社会主义的活动。
