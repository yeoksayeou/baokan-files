Zhang Bojun is Determined to Rebel
Yan Xinmin, Member of the Central Executive Bureau of the China Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party

Entered the Liberated Area with Base Motives, Claiming to be a Political Prisoner

Before liberation, Zhang Bojun's anti-communist activities in Hong Kong had reached a frenzied degree. However, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, in its broad-minded, selfless, and benevolent spirit, invited him back to the mainland to discuss national affairs. Zhang Bojun was not moved by this great proletarian spirit. On the contrary, he harbored ulterior motives, carrying the private "negotiation" goods, and boarded the ship. When he heard the broadcast of the liberation of Jinan while sailing north from Hong Kong to the Yellow Sea, Zhang Bojun sighed and said, "The situation is over." He originally thought that the US and Chiang would never give up Jinan. From the liberation of Jinan, he saw that the United States had no determination and saw Chiang Kai-shek's danger, thus losing faith in his imagined "stalemate" and "division of the world into three." Despite these words, the liberation of Jinan did not actually make him give up. The private "negotiation" goods followed the voyage all the way north, all the way into the liberated areas.

Zhang Bojun's private goods arrived in the Northeast, but could not find a market. No wonder he wrote unhappily to the CPWDP Central Committee members who remained in Hong Kong, saying, "There is nothing to do here, and nothing can be obtained from others. It is a great loss for us to underestimate ourselves so much. The struggle is a long-term one, and it is still possible to catch up. My usual views are still correct, and I still want to find a way to return to Hong Kong." Zhang Bojun felt deeply unappreciated in the Northeast after liberation and could not stand the new things. The only things that interested him were antiques and calligraphy, and he had the same interests as the consistently speculative profiteer Zhang Naiqi, frequenting antique shops day and night. Truly "brothers" in the same vein, brothers in adversity, "nothing can be obtained from others," but they gained a lot in antiques.

After arriving in Beijing, Zhang Bojun was in a very bad mood, often scolding people, especially when talking about the affairs of the CPWDP, and especially when talking about the progressive comrades of the CPWDP Central Committee and some progressive elements of the China Democratic League. Of course, as soon as the person in charge of the Communist Party arrived, he would immediately change to a kind and amiable face.

When Zhang Bojun first met his long-lost old friend Comrade Ji Fang, he began by saying, "I have become a political prisoner!" This means that he deeply felt the pain of not being able to use his anti-communist and anti-socialist conspiracies in the people's world. When someone asked whether there was any difference between the New Democracy and the CPWDP's program, Zhang Bojun said, "There is no difference at all. Our program actually meets the requirements of the broad masses even more. But politics depends on force, and today the force and power are in the hands of the Communist Party, so what can be done?" He also said to a young cadre of the CPWDP, "We failed to organize after the revolution succeeded." Zhang Bojun would not be willing to fail. Even when he first arrived in Beijing, he secretly sent people or instructed local responsible cadres to engage in military activities. There were activities in East China, Central South, and even Northwest China. When the million-strong army went down to the south of the Yangtze River, sweeping away the Chiang bandits with the force of an autumn wind, the whole country rejoiced, but what about Zhang Bojun? He said fiercely, "Chiang Kai-shek is really useless, he even lost all our capital." The "capital" here refers to the base areas in Jiangxi, Fujian, and other provinces, the source of Zhang Bojun's ideal Zhang dynasty; like Prussia in the German Empire.

What a "world belonging to others"! Saying that the people's world came about "all of a sudden"

Once in his room at the Beijing Hotel, Zhang roared at several cadres from the localities, "You are too useless, now the world belongs to others." What a "world belonging to others"! Zhang Bojun's line with the people is really clear. After all, it is not easy to dominate the world in a country as large as China with a large population, so the Zhang-Luo alliance later emerged. That is to say, they wanted to create a world for the Zhang and Luo surnames. In April of this year, at the first symposium of the CPWDP Central Committee and the Beijing Municipal Committee to study Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," Zhang Bojun said, "Old Mao is now both happy and afraid. He is happy that he got this world of 600 million people all of a sudden, and he is afraid of what 600 million people will eat and wear… China has 600 million people, who have to eat and wear every day, and others are reaching out to you, what do you think, what should be done?" When these sentences are linked to the above sentences, it shows how absurd, arrogant, and insidious Zhang Bojun is. He is jealous and resentful that the Chinese people have obtained a world of 600 million people. He regards the people's world as belonging to Chairman Mao alone or one family, and he believes that this world came about "all of a sudden." The right-wing ambitionists disregard the history of the Chinese people's arduous struggle under the leadership of the Communist Party, disregard the significant improvement of the people's lives in the socialist construction that has begun to take shape today, and even more cannot see the infinitely happy prospects of the people's lives in the radiant future.

Double-dealing, hating progress, hating the Three-Anti Campaign

In politics, Zhang Bojun is a thorough double-dealer. After arriving in Beijing, he used all his thoughts to perfunctorily deal with the Communist Party to gain the trust of the Party and the government. On the other hand, he does not hate evil, but hates progress like an enemy. When the CPWDP held its Fifth National Congress of Cadres at the end of 1949, everyone criticized the past middle-of-the-road line and decided to study Marxism-Leninism and accept the leadership of the Communist Party. Zhang Bojun agreed to the criticism of the middle-of-the-road line on the surface, but was dissatisfied in his heart. Finally, in order to deal with Premier Zhou, he reluctantly admitted the CPWDP's historical "70% anti-Chiang, 30% anti-Communist." Under Zhang Bojun's conspiracy activities, a large number of people with unclear political backgrounds or even reactionary elements were mixed into the CPWDP's local organizations before and during the national liberation. The progressive comrades from the central to the local levels were unwilling to carry this heavy burden and mostly advocated ending it. Zhang Bojun and others called them "abolitionists." His response to these people was, "turn big into small, turn small into nothing"; and said, "People can only die slowly, not all at once." Zhang Bojun liked and regarded as confidants only those rightists who recruited soldiers and horses for him and advocated dividing the court, and even criminals with serious political problems. Comrade Ji Fang was a person he had always hated because Ji later worked in the Subei Liberated Area for many years. Zhang thought that Ji was a Communist Party member, and automatically nominated him as a member of the preparatory committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Vice Minister of Communications, and even entrusted the personnel department (then not yet the organization department) of the CPWDP Central Committee to him, saying, "I will hand over the Party to you." This was to show the CCP and express trust in the Communist Party. But what was the reality? Ji had a position but no power in the CPWDP. Nothing could be done without Zhang Bojun's nod. The power of the Central Party Headquarters was actually in the hands of Zhang's confidants, who had blood debts in history.

Later, Comrade Ji Fang and I (Wang Shenlin also joined later) presided over the "Three-Anti Campaign" of the CPWDP Central Committee, completely destroying the corruption group of Zhang Bojun's confidants. Some were suspended for reflection, some were dismissed, and some were sentenced. Except for making a perfunctory mobilization report at the beginning of the movement, Zhang Bojun did not step into the door of the Party headquarters or ask us to talk once during the entire Three-Anti Campaign. He hated the Three-Anti Campaign, hated us, and said that the Three-Anti Campaign of the CPWDP Central Committee was against him. As soon as the Three-Anti Campaign ended, Zhang rushed to the Party headquarters, angrily pointed at Ji's nose and said, "You have always been against me, you are a rightist in the history of the CPWDP. I thought you were a Communist Party member and asked you to be responsible in the Party, who knew I had mistaken the person." I was there at the time. This is the attitude of Zhang Bojun, chairman of the CPWDP, towards the great Three-Anti Campaign. We, who resolutely stood on the side of the people and presided over the Three-Anti Campaign, became criminals in front of Zhang.

After the Fifth National Congress of Cadres of the CPWDP, the organization was rectified with the vigorous help of the united front departments in various places. By the Sixth National Congress of Cadres at the end of 1951, Minister Li Weihan supported the policy of developing on the one hand and consolidating on the other, that is, combining consolidation with development, and actively carrying out ideological remolding of members. Of course, Zhang Bojun, who had been depressed for a long time and eager to try, was not interested in consolidation or ideological remolding, but in development. Development requires some arrangements. Zhang Bojun absorbed two old Communist Party members to participate in the Central Committee, one to support the scene, and the other to confuse the United Front Department, while painstakingly seeking to transfer Huang Qixiang to Beijing as his loyal partner. This wish was finally realized after many requests. The next was to transfer Li Boqiu, who pretended to be a leftist and was brave for profit, to Beijing. As a result of this transfer of troops, the so-called leading core of the CPWDP, headed by Zhang Bojun, was finally formed, and the right-wing conspiracy group of Zhang, Huang, and Li was formed.

In the China Democratic League, until the summer of last year, Zhang Bojun had to use the leftists in order to compete with Luo Longji for leadership, so he always appeared as a leftist. However, his crazy political ambitions and his own class interests finally made him have to alienate the leftists and then form an alliance with the Luo Longji group. Zhang Bojun has never been convinced or valued Shen Henglao, the chairman of the China Democratic League, who has firmly stood on the side of progress for many years and has gained the trust of the Communist Party. Even though Shen Lao rarely interfered with the league affairs due to health reasons, Zhang did not give up because of this. When Shen Lao entered the hospital in 1953, Zhang asserted that there was no hope for recovery. Shen Lao was once critically ill, and Zhang Bojun was full of interest. He was extremely enthusiastic about the league affairs. Later, his condition improved and his life was no longer in danger, and Zhang was listless, as if he had lost his soul. But he often said on the surface, I have always respected Henglao, and I always push him to speak at important meetings. This is the quality of the ambitious Zhang Bojun.

Zhang, Huang, and Li planned to rectify the leftists. Saying that intellectuals are serfs, thinking that the world of the socialist world is about to change.

Within the CPWDP, Zhang Bojun undisguisedly supported the right, backward, and even elements with serious political problems from leaders to general cadres, from the central to the local levels. Even Wang Yifan, Zhang Bojun's backbone, confessed, "After Zhang Bojun returned from Beidaihe last year, he invited Huang Qixiang, Li Boqiu, Zhang Yunchuan, Wang Yifan, etc. to dinner at home, under the pretext of establishing collective leadership, saying that he wanted to rectify the left-wing elements of the CPWDP." What is subtle is that the right-wing backbone confessed this fact, but Li Boqiu, who has always regarded himself as a leftist, is so forgetful. Because Zhang Bojun led the CPWDP in this way, the organizations from the central to some local levels were often unclear about right and wrong, black and white, and even reversed black and white, taking non-truth as truth and truth as non-truth. Zhang Bojun said more than once, "Intellectuals are all serfs of the Communist Party." In fact, the Communist Party respects and trusts intellectuals enough. I think it is Zhang Bojun himself who regards the members of the CPWDP as serfs for his own use.

After the 20th Congress of the CPSU, especially after the Hungarian incident, Zhang Bojun believed that the world was about to change. Not only was the world of the Soviet Union and the Eastern European people's democratic countries about to change, but the world of China was also about to change. But I have never heard Zhang Bojun talk about the world of the capitalist world changing. Of course, in Zhang Bojun's view, the world of the capitalist world is eternally unchanged; not only is the world of the capitalist world unchanged, but the world of the socialist world is about to become the world of capitalism. Zhang Bojun believes that he has studied Hegel's philosophy and must have regarded capitalism as the eternal "absolute concept" or "absolute spirit," mystifying it, while the socialist society is short-lived and must be restored to the placenta of its capitalist mother. But history tells us the opposite, only capitalism can become socialism, there is no reason for socialism to regress to capitalism!

Promoting the superiority of capitalism, agitating rebellion everywhere, saying that the only way out is the "Hungarian incident."

The proposal of the policy of "long-term coexistence" and "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," and Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference, were all distorted by Zhang Bojun and used as weapons against the Party and socialism. We use facts to illustrate the superiority of socialism, but Zhang Bojun uses "two-chamber system" and "you come down, I go up" to promote that capitalism is dynamic and superior. People all over the country are studying Marxism-Leninism and practicing Marxism-Leninism, but Zhang Bojun said, "Marxism-Leninism cannot be eaten or worn, there are only a few dry bars. On the other hand, 'The Analects' and 'Zeng Guofan's Family Letters' are about to come into vogue." The Party and the government want everyone to learn from the Soviet Union, but Zhang Bojun hates the Soviet Union and says that the Soviet Union has no culture at all. He praises the atomic power of the United States and the production and technology of West Germany. He even believes that "the saying that there is a capitalist economic crisis is shallow and boring." Our socialist democracy is expanding and playing its role day by day, and Chairman Mao put forward the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." But Zhang Bojun feels that there is no democracy. He said, "If a person cannot think independently, he is like a tiger in the western suburban park."

Zhang Bojun is an outstanding and reactionary political agitator. This spring, he inspected the Tianjin New Port and passed through the disaster area of Wuqing. At a symposium of the CPWDP Central Committee, he depicted, "Only forty miles away from Beijing, the people have to bring bedding and line up overnight, waiting for the mixed grain, dried radish, or a piece of bean cake that can only feed them for three days the next day. Sometimes they have to eat leaves. And on the other side, there are tall buildings and buttered bread." This is a picture of heaven and hell depicted by Zhang Bojun. Finally, he also mentioned that the workers on the Tianjin wharf also had problems. Last winter, Zhang Bojun inspected the waterways in the name of the Minister of Communications, cruising along the Yangtze River and the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas on a special boat. When he returned, he said at a central symposium, "What caught my eye everywhere was that the Communist Party headquarters were all the best western-style houses, and the responsible persons went in and out in cars. I think that if this continues, the people will rebel." At another symposium held by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPWDP, he said, "Some intellectuals have been severely criticized in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. I think that if this continues, intellectuals will rebel." When he went to see Chu Anping, in addition to talking about the problems of peasants and students that could not be solved, he also said that the problem of arranging more than 10 million Communist Party members could not be solved by education. It seems that Zhang Bojun is determined to rebel, and pretends to be "compassionate" and agitates everywhere. He believes that under the leadership of the Communist Party, workers, peasants, students, intellectuals, and even the Communist Party itself have problems. Under the condition that the sky does not change, that is, the leadership of the Communist Party does not change and the socialist system does not change, these problems cannot be solved. So, how does the sky change? In his view, the Hungarian incident is an example. But Zhang Bojun forgot that the final winner of the Hungarian incident was not Nagy, let alone the Horthy elements, but the Communist Party! The Communist Party and socialism will never fail. Let the crazy right-wing adventurers be bloodied!

    章伯钧决心要造反
    中国农工民主党中央执行局委员　严信民
    抱着卑鄙目的走进解放区，还说作了政治俘虏
    解放前章伯钧在香港的反共活动，虽然已经达到了疯狂的程度，但中共中央仍本宽大无私、与人为善的精神，邀他回国共商国是。可是章伯钧并未为这种无产阶级的伟大气魄所感动。相反，他却抱着不可告人的目的，带上“谈判”的私货，走进船舱。当北航至黄海途中听到济南解放的广播时，章伯钧慨叹地说：“大势已去”。他原以为美蒋决不放弃济南。由济南之解放，他看出美国没有决心，看出蒋介石的危急，因而对他所幻想的“相持局面”、“三分天下”，失去信心。话虽如此说，实际上济南的解放，并未使他死心。“谈判”的私货，随着航程一直北上，一直带进解放区。
    章伯钧的私货到了东北，但却找不到市场。难怪他郁郁不乐地写信给留港的农工民主党中委们说：“此间无事可为，求人无所得。我等多年轻视自己，就是很大的损失。斗争是长期的，急起直追，还来得及。我平时的看法仍然正确，还想设法回香港来。”章伯钧在解放后的东北，深感怀才不遇，看不惯新鲜事物，唯一感兴趣的，是古董、字画，与一贯投机倒把的奸商章乃器却有同好，朝朝暮暮出入于古董铺之门。真是“宗兄”宗弟，难兄难弟，“求人无所得”，在古玩上却收获不小。
    到北京后，章伯钧的情绪很坏，动辄就要骂人，尤其是谈到农工民主党党务的时候，尤其是谈到农工民主党中央进步同志和民盟一部分进步分子的时候。当然只要中共方面负责人一到，他会马上换一副和颜悦色的面孔的。
    章伯钧第一次见到他久别的老友季方同志时，开头就说：“我作了政治俘虏！”这就是说，他深感在人民的天下，他那套反共、反社会主义的阴谋无技可施之苦。当有人问道，新民主主义与农工民主党的纲领有无区别时，章伯钧说：“根本没有区别。我们的纲领，实际上还更符合广大群众的要求。不过搞政治要靠武力，今天武力、政权都握在共产党手里，有什么办法呢？”他又对农工民主党一位青年干部说：“革命成功了，我们搞组织是失败了。”章伯钧是不会甘心失败的，就是初到北京，他仍偷偷摸摸地派人或指示地方负责干部搞军事活动，华东、中南甚至西北都有所活动。百万雄师下江南，以秋风扫落叶之势扫荡蒋匪，举国欢腾，而章伯钧呢？他狠狠地说：“蒋介石真不中用，连我们的本钱都输光了。”这里的“本钱”指的是江西、福建等省地盘，是章伯钧理想中的章姓王朝的策源地；犹普鲁士之于德意志帝国一样。
    好一个“天下是人家的”！说人民的天下是“一下子”得来的
    一次在北京饭店他的房间里，章对地方来的几位干部大发雷霆说：“你们太不中用，现在天下是人家的。”好一个“天下是人家的”！章伯钧和人民的界限划得真清楚。毕竟中国地大人多，独霸天下是不易做到的，于是后来出现了章罗联盟。也就是说要创出一个章罗两姓的天下。今年4月，在农工民主党中委和北京市委首次学习毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的座谈会上，章伯钧说：“老毛现在是一则以喜，一则以惧。喜的是一下子就得了这个六亿人口的天下，惧的是六亿人口吃什么，穿什么……中国自己有六亿人，天天要吃要穿，还有别人向你伸手，你们看，怎么办？”这几句话和上面的话联系起来看，说明章伯钧是何等荒诞狂妄，居心叵测。他嫉妒、怀恨中国人民得了六亿人口的天下。他将人民的天下看成毛主席一人或一家的天下，他认为这个天下是“一下子”得来的。右派野心家无视中国人民在共产党领导下艰苦斗争的历史，无视在社会主义建设初具规模的今天，人民生活的显著改善，更看不见在光芒万丈的明天，人民生活无限幸福的远景。
    两面手法，仇进步，仇三反
    在政治上，章伯钧是个彻头彻尾的两面派。到北京以后，他一方面用尽心思敷衍共产党，博得党和政府的信任，另一方面，不是嫉恶，而是嫉进步如仇。1949年底农工民主党召开第五次全国干部会议的时候，大家批判了过去的中间路线，决定学习马列主义，接受共产党的领导。对中间路线的批判，章伯钧是表面同意，心怀不满的。最后为了应付周总理，才狼狈地承认了农工民主党历史上的“七分反蒋，三分反共”。农工民主党各地组织在全国解放前夕，解放期间，在章伯钧的阴谋活动下，混进来大批政治面貌不清以至反动的分子。由中央到地方的进步同志不肯背这沉重包袱，多主张结束，章伯钧等称之为“取消派”。他应付这派人的说法是，“由大化小，由小化无”；并说：“人只能慢慢地，而不能一下子死去。”章伯钧所喜爱，并视为心腹的只是那些替他招兵买马，主张分庭抗礼的右派，乃至政治上有过严重问题的犯罪分子。季方同志，是他一贯憎恨的人，因季后来在苏北解放区参加工作多年，章以为季是共产党员，自动提名为人民政协筹备委员、交通部副部长，连农工民主党中央人事处（当时还不是组织部）都付托了他，并说：“我将党交给你”。这是给中共看，表示信赖共产党。可是实际呢？季在农工民主党内是有职无权的，一件事情不得章伯钧的点头也行不通。中央党部的大权，实际上是操在历史上有血债的章的亲信手里。
    后来季方同志和我（王深林后来也参加了）主持农工民主党中央的“三反”，彻底摧毁了章伯钧亲信的贪污集团。有的停职反省，有的撤职，有的判刑。章伯钧除运动开始时假惺惺地作了动员报告外，整个三反期间，未踏进过党部的大门，未约过我们谈一次话。他恨三反，恨我们，说农工民主党中央的三反，反到他的头上。三反刚一结束，章就赶到党部，怒气冲天地指着季的鼻子说：“你从来就是反对我，你是农工民主党历史上的右派。我以为你是共产党，叫你在党里负责，谁晓得我错认了人。”当时我是在旁的。这就是农工民主党主席章伯钧对伟大的三反运动所持的态度。我们坚决地站在人民方面主持三反的人，在章的面前，成了罪人。
    农工民主党第五次全国干部会议后，在各地统战部大力帮助下整顿了组织。到1951年底第六次全国干部会议时，李维汉部长就支持了一面发展、一面巩固，即巩固与发展相结合，并积极对成员进行思想改造的方针。当然，苦闷已久、跃跃欲试的章伯钧，感兴趣的不是巩固，不是思想改造，而是发展。发展就得有所布置。章伯钧吸收了两位老共产党员参加中央委员会，一则撑撑场面，再则借以迷惑统战部，而处心积虑以求之的是调黄琪翔来京，作为他的忠实伙伴。这一愿望，经过多次要求，终于实现了。再就是调伪装左派、见利勇为的李伯球来京。这样调兵遣将的结果，终于结成了章伯钧所谓的农工民主党的领导核心，结成了以章伯钧为首的章、黄、李右派阴谋集团。
    在民盟，一直到去年夏季以前，章伯钧为了与罗隆基争领导，不能不利用一下左派，所以他总是以左派面貌出现的。但是疯狂的政治野心，自己的阶级利益，终于又使他不能不疏远左派，进而与罗隆基集团结为联盟了。对于民盟主席，多少年来坚决站在进步方面，得到共产党信任的沈衡老，章伯钧从来是不服气，看不在眼里的。沈老尽管因健康关系很少过问盟务，章并不因之甘心。1953年当沈老进了医院的时候，章就断言病已无望。沈老一度病危，章伯钧兴致勃勃。对盟务备极热心。后来病势好转，性命无虑，章无精打彩，像失去了灵魂一样。可是他在口头上又常说，我从来是尊重衡老的，在重要会议上我都是推他发言。这就是野心家章伯钧作人的品质。
    章黄李策划整左派。说知识分子是农奴，认为社会主义世界的天要变。
    在农工民主党内，章伯钧是不加掩饰地，由领导到一般干部，由中央到地方，支持着右的、落后的乃至曾有严重政治问题的分子。就连章伯钧的骨干分子王一帆也交代说：“去年章伯钧从北戴河回来后，在家里约了黄琪翔、李伯球、张云川、王一帆等吃饭，以建立集体领导为名，说要整农工民主党的左派分子。”微妙的是右派骨干交代出了这个事实，而一向以左派自居的李伯球，却竟如是其健忘。由于章伯钧对农工民主党是如此的领导，由中央到某些地方的组织内，常常是是非不明，黑白不分，甚至颠倒黑白，以非为是，以是为非。章伯钧不止一次地说：“知识分子都是共产党的农奴”。其实，共产党对知识分子是够尊重的，够信任的。我看倒是章伯钧自己才把农工民主党的成员视为供自己驱使的农奴。
    苏共二十次代表大会，特别是匈牙利事件发生后，章伯钧认为天要变。不光苏联、东欧人民民主国家的天要变，中国的天也要变。可是从未听过章伯钧谈到资本主义世界的天要变。当然，在章伯钧看来，资本主义世界的天是永恒不变的；资本主义世界的天不仅不变，社会主义世界的天倒要变成资本主义的天。章伯钧自认为对黑格尔的哲学有研究，想必是将资本主义当作永恒的“绝对观念”或“绝对精神”，神化起来，而社会主义社会倒是短命的，还要还原到它的资本主义母亲的胎盘里去。可是历史告诉我们的正是相反，只有资本主义变为社会主义，决没有社会主义倒退到资本主义的道理！
    宣扬资本主义的优越性，到处煽动造反说唯一出路是“匈牙利事件”。
    “长期共存”、“百家争鸣”方针的提出，毛主席在最高国务会议上的讲话，都被章伯钧加以歪曲，作为反党、反社会主义的武器。我们用事实说明社会主义的优越性，章伯钧却用“两院制”，“你下来，我上去”，来宣扬资本主义有活力，有优越性。全国人都在学习马列主义，实践马列主义，章伯钧则说，“马列主义不能吃，不能穿，只有干巴巴的那么几条。倒是‘论语’、‘曾国藩家书’要走起运来”。党和政府要大家学习苏联，章伯钧却仇恨苏联，说苏联根本没有文化。他对美国的原子力量，西德的生产、技术称赞不已。他甚至认为，“资本主义经济危机的说法，是浅薄无聊”。我国社会主义的民主，一天天在扩大，在发挥作用，毛主席提出了“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针。章伯钧却觉得没有民主。说什么“一个人如果不能独立思考，就像西郊公园里的老虎一样”。
    章伯钧是个出色的、反动的政治煽动家。今年春天他视察天津新港回来车过武清灾区。在农工民主党中央的座谈会上就描绘地说，“那里离北京仅四十里，老百姓就得从先一天起，带着铺盖卷露夜排队，等候第二天的只供三天充饥的混合粮、萝卜干或一块豆饼。有时还得吃树叶。而这边呢，高楼大厦，黄油面包”。这就是章伯钧描绘的一幅天堂地狱图。最后他还提到天津码头上的工人也出了问题。去年冬，章伯钧借交通部长之名视察水道，专轮漫游长江苏杭一带。归来又在中央座谈会上说，“我到处刺目惊心的是，共产党党部都是最好的洋房，负责人出入是小汽车。我看这样下去，老百姓是会造反的”。又一次在农工党北京市委召开的座谈会上说，“在肃反中有些知识分子被斗得很厉害，我看这样下去，知识分子是会造反的”。他去看储安平时，除谈到农民、学生问题不能解决外，还说一千多万共产党员的安排问题，不是教育所能解决。看来，章伯钧是下了决心要造反的，并且装出“悲天悯人”的样子，到处进行煽动。他认为在共产党领导下工人、农民、学生、知识分子，甚至共产党内部都有问题。在天不变，即共产党领导权不变，社会主义制度不变的情况下，这些问题是得不到解决的。那么，天怎样变呢？在他看来，匈牙利事件就是榜样。可是章伯钧却忘记了匈牙利事件的最后胜利者，并不是纳吉，更不是霍尔蒂分子，还是共产党！共产党，社会主义是永远不会失败的。让疯狂的右派冒险家们碰得头破血流吧！
