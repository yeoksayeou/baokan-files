Xinhua News Agency, 12th. Party rightist Wang Zhong, director of the Journalism Department of Fudan University, continued to deny his anti-Party words and deeds at a symposium of Beijing journalists held today. His vile attitude was unanimously condemned by the comrades present. The meeting also continued to expose many facts and decided to let him return to Shanghai for a thorough explanation. Wang Zhong's "self-criticism" at today's meeting not only failed to acknowledge the serious nature of his mistakes, but also slandered past news reports about him as "inconsistent with the facts," attempting to counterattack the Party. At the meeting, the chairman immediately brought out the news reports about him and asked him to point out where the "inconsistencies with the facts" were. As a result, every so-called "inconsistency with the facts" that he pointed out was found to have conclusive evidence in his written remarks, which he himself had reviewed. Faced with such facts, Wang Zhong was sometimes speechless and sometimes evasive, his attitude was extremely embarrassed, and he had to express his willingness to continue the explanation.

Deng Tuo, Chairman of the All-China Journalists Association, spoke at the meeting at the end. Deng Tuo pointed out that Wang Zhong is a Party rightist with a program and actions. Soon after the people's revolution had just defeated the bourgeois news front, he picked up the weapon of bourgeois reactionary news theory, served as a bodyguard for the bourgeoisie on the news front, and attacked the Party. He had long betrayed the Party and the people politically and ideologically. When attacking the Party, Wang Zhong also held Fudan University's Journalism Department as his base, and the Fudan University students who supported his reactionary arguments as his team.

Deng Tuo said that Wang Zhong is now facing the danger of completely destroying himself politically. If he fails to face this point in his continued confession after returning to Shanghai, he will completely isolate himself from the people.

    在首都新闻工作座谈会上
    王中妄想抵赖受到一致斥责
    据新华社12日讯　党内右派分子、复旦大学新闻系主任王中在今天举行的北京新闻工作者座谈会上对他的反党言行继续抵赖，他的恶劣态度受到了与会同志的一致斥责。会议并继续揭露了许多事实，决定让他回到上海后彻底交代。王中在今天会上的“检讨”，不但不承认他所犯错误的严重性质，反而还污蔑过去关于他的新闻报道“与事实不符”，妄想向党反扑。会上，会议主席当场取来关于他的新闻报道，叫他指出“事实不符”之处。结果，他指出的每个所谓“事实不符”，都在他的经过他自己看过的书面言论中找到了确凿的根据。面对这样的事实，王中时而哑口无言，时而支吾其词，态度极为狼狈，并不得不表示要继续交代。
    中华全国新闻工作者协会会长邓拓最后在会上发言。邓拓指出，王中是一个有纲领有行动的党内右派分子，他在人民革命刚刚打垮资产阶级的新闻阵地后不久，就捡起资产阶级反动新闻理论的武器，在新闻战线上为资产阶级保镖，向党进攻。他在政治上和思想上早已背叛了党和人民。王中在向党进攻时，并且把持复旦大学新闻系作为他的阵地，以支持他的反动论点的复旦大学学生作为他的队伍。
    邓拓说，王中现在已经面临着政治上完全毁灭自己的危险的边缘，如果他在回到上海后的继续交代中不能正视这一点，他就将彻底地自绝于人民。
