　　Scientists Must Constantly Study Marxism-Leninism
　　Professor of Plant Protection Department, Beijing Agricultural University, Qiu Weiban
　　Before the Party launched the rectification campaign, I not only had some erroneous ideas of complacency, but I also lacked vigilance towards the people around me. At that time, I thought that after several movements, with this bit of experience to stand firm, to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, would probably be "no problem." At the same time, I also thought at that time that after several ideological reforms since liberation, through the perceptual understanding of the brilliant achievements of China's socialist construction, except for those who were insane, probably the vast majority of intellectuals "did not support the Communist Party," "nor were they unwilling to take the socialist road."

　　In newspapers, big-character posters, and some forums, although I did not release any poisonous weeds myself, I had three views on those rightist remarks in my mind: First, I mistakenly believed that some remarks "had a certain reason" ideologically. Because when the rightists provoked the relationship between the Party and the masses, they always seized on a little pigtail to make a big issue out of it. These pigtails, such as individual sectarian sentiments, bureaucracy, or subjectivism, were originally not concealed by the Party, and were also the object of rectification. However, the rightists made a big issue out of these individual shortcomings. They exaggerated and rendered the work style of individual Party members, saying it was general, resulting in what the rightists of Beijing Agricultural University said, that there was "a high wall and a deep ditch" between the Party and the masses, and that the Three-Anti and Five-Anti campaigns had "small achievements and big shortcomings," and that their "methods were crude and not suitable for intellectuals," and so on. Precisely because they often first said something about a little bit of it, and then exaggerated it into a big pile, this confused people, making it easy for people to believe the exaggerated parts from the correct parts they said, thus generating emotions of sympathy for their fallacies. Some other remarks made people feel vaguely and unable to distinguish right from wrong, because they adopted concealed wording, and it was difficult to see their ugly content at a glance when vigilance was not high. For example, the rightists of Beijing Agricultural University proposed to "openly lead the Party," "the trade union protects the interests of the masses," "to fight for teaching power," and "designing a system," and so on. In the early stage of the rectification campaign, these arguments did not attract my attention, nor did I analyze their content, so I neither expressed agreement nor came out to oppose them. The third type of remarks were disgusting at a glance, such as the fallacies of Ge Peiqi, Chu Anping, and the anti-Party remarks on big-character posters issued by some ulterior motives, big and small rightists. However, at that time, due to ideological confusion, it was thought that such deviations might occur in the midst of great blooming and contending. Knowing that they were wrong, their motives were thought of in a good way.

　　These confusions in my thinking in the early stage of the rectification campaign fully demonstrated the instability of my position and viewpoint, and also demonstrated the prominence of my own right-leaning thoughts, and also showed my lack of Marxist-Leninist class analysis ability. As Mayor Peng Zhen said: Only by using the weapon of class analysis can the content of the rightists be exposed, and can their true colors be revealed.

　　Chairman Mao's report on the correct handling of contradictions among the people and Premier Zhou Enlai's recent political report were precisely throwing lifebuoys to those who were sinking and floating in the waves caused by the rightists; at the same time, they armed all those who were prepared to fight against the rightists with theory; and quickly rescued those who had been captured by the rightists after the start of the rectification campaign. At this time, my eyes were brightened, I began to use this weapon to identify fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds, and I quickly realized the true intention of the Zhang-Luo alliance. It turned out that they wanted to subvert our hard-won socialist system, to usurp the leadership of the Party, and to lead us to the old road of semi-colonialism. Except for traitors and heartless reactionaries, who would be willing to be led by them down the slope? Therefore, at this time I began to resolutely throw myself into the anti-rightist struggle. The masses ruthlessly peeled off the ugly faces of the rightists, making them speechless and only able to bow their heads and admit their guilt to the people. The rightists had to admit that the so-called "open leadership of the Party" was essentially to openly give the leadership of the Party to the democratic parties, which was to abolish the leadership of the Party; the so-called "trade union protects the interests of the masses" was essentially to oppose the Party and the trade union, and its intention was consistent with the so-called "protection of scientists" in the "scientific program" drafted by Zeng Zhaolun, Qian Weichang and others. The so-called "designing a system" in schools is the same as the "political design institute" of Zhang and Luo. These rebuttals made all those who love the Party and support socialism suddenly realize and wake up from a dream.

　　Through this profound tempering of the anti-rightist struggle, I have clarified the weaknesses in my thinking and further consolidated the proletarian position and viewpoint. What I have learned the most is that I have initially learned how to use the weapon of class analysis to fight against those rightists who are hidden under the cloak of socialism and want to engage in capitalist smuggling.

　　However, in order to learn to be good at using this weapon to defend our socialist cause, even for scientific workers like us, we must further and continuously study Marxism-Leninism; and only under the leadership of the Party can our education and scientific research work truly serve the construction of socialism.

　　科学家要不断学习马列主义
    北京农业大学植物保护系教授　裘维蕃
    在党提出整风以前，我非但有一些错误的自满的想法，而且对我周围熟悉的人物也没有警惕性。那时我认为，经过了历次运动，凭这一点经验来站稳立场，分清敌我，大概是“不成问题的”。同时我那时也以为，解放以来经过多次的思想改造，通过我国社会主义建设的辉煌成就的感性认识，除了丧心病狂之徒以外，大概绝大多数的知识分子没有“不拥护共产党的”，“也没有不愿意走社会主义道路的”。
    我在报章上、大字报上以及一些座谈会上，虽然自己没有放出毒草，但是对那些右派言论在思想上却有三种看法：第一是我在思想上对某些言论错误地认为“有一定道理”。因为右派在挑拨党群关系时，他们总是抓住了一点点小辫子做大文章的。这种小辫子，例如个别的宗派情绪、官僚主义或主观主义等，原来是党并不讳言的，而且也是整风的对象。但是，右派就对这些个别的缺点做起文章来了。他们把个别党员的工作作风夸大渲染，说成是一般的，结果像北京农业大学的右派分子所说党和群众之间“墙高沟深”，又说三反、肃反“成绩小、缺点大”，“做法粗暴，不适于对知识分子”等等。唯其因为他们往往先说对其中的一点点，然后夸大成一大堆，这样就迷惑了人，使人容易从说对的部分来相信他们夸大的部分，从而产生了同情他们这些谬论的情绪。对另外一些言论，使人模模糊糊，事非莫辨，因为他们采取了隐蔽的辞意，在警惕性不高的情况下，竟难于一眼就看出他们丑恶的内容。譬如北京农业大学的右派分子曾提出要“党公开领导”，“工会保护群众利益”，“要争取教权”和“设计制度”等等。在整风的初期，这些论点没有引起我的注意，也没有分析它们的内容，因此我既不表示同意，也没有出来反对。第三类言论是一眼就令人厌恶的，例如葛佩琦、储安平等的谬论以及一些别有用心的大大小小右派分子出的大字报上的反党言论。但是，在当时由于思想纷乱，认为大鸣大放中可能发生这种偏差。明知他们错误，然而把他们的动机却往好处想。
    整风初期我在思想上的这些混乱，充分说明了我的立场观点的不稳定，也说明我自己的右倾思想的冒尖，而且也表现了我缺乏马克思列宁主义的阶级分析能力。正如彭真市长所说的：只有利用阶级分析的武器，才能揭发右派分子的内容，才能使他们原形毕现。
    毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的报告以及周恩来总理最近的政治报告，正是向右派造成的波涛中给载沉载浮的人投下了救生圈；同时也用理论武装了一切准备和右派分子斗争的人；而且迅速解救了那些被右派分子在整风开始后俘虏的人。这时，我的眼睛擦亮了，我开始用这种武器来识别香花和毒草，而且很快就认识到章罗联盟的真意图。原来他们想颠覆我们得来非易的社会主义制度，想篡夺党的领导权，想把我们导向半殖民地的老路上去。除了卖国贼和全无心肝的反动派以外，有谁甘愿被他们牵着鼻子走下坡路呢？因此，我这时才开始坚决地投入反右派斗争。群众无情地剥开了右派分子的丑恶面貌，使他们理屈辞穷，只能向人民低头认罪。右派分子们不得不承认，所谓要“党公开领导”，实质上就是要把党的领导公开给民主党派，也就是想取消党的领导；所谓“工会保护群众利益”，实质上要把党和工会对立起来，其用意和曾昭抡、钱伟长等所拟“科学纲领”中所谓“保护科学家”一致。所谓在学校中要来一个“设计制度”，是与章罗的“政治设计院”如出一辙的。这些驳斥，使所有爱护党，拥护社会主义的人们都恍然大悟，如梦初醒。
    通过这一次深刻的反右派斗争的锻炼，使我明确了自己思想上的弱点，进一步巩固了无产阶级的立场观点。我体会得最深的就是初步学会了如何用阶级分析的武器来和那些隐藏在社会主义外衣下想作资本主义走私的右派分子斗争。
    但是，要学会善于运用这一武器来保卫我们的社会主义事业，即使是像我们这样的科学工作者，也必须进一步不断地学习马克思列宁主义；而且也只有在党的领导下，我们的教育工作和科学研究工作才能真正为社会主义的建设服务。
