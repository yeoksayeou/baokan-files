In early July, continuous torrential rains in Henan, Shandong, Shaanxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other regions caused flooding, resulting in some losses to crops.

Based on the experience of the past few years, for autumn seedlings that have been lightly flooded or still have a chance of yielding a harvest after the flood, do not easily destroy them for replanting. Actively drain the accumulated water, remove rotten leaves and mud, cultivate the soil, and apply fertilizer to quickly restore the vitality of the seedlings and strive for a better harvest. For areas severely affected by the disaster with no hope of harvest, seize the opportunity to replant. This is of great significance for compensating for disaster losses and shortening the duration of the famine. In July 1954, after the Henan Province floods, more than seven million mu of late autumn crops were replanted. Due to strengthened field management, a 40% yield was still obtained.

There are many early-maturing crops that can be replanted in late autumn. In the Huai River basin, buckwheat can still be sown until "Chushu" (the end of the heat). The sowing time for carrots, turnips, and other crops can be even later. In some areas of the Yangtze River basin, autumn corn, late millet, late soybeans, autumn potatoes, buckwheat, and autumn vegetables can be sown before "Liqiu" (the beginning of autumn). In some places, these late autumn early-maturing crops can even be replanted before "Chushu." Since the late autumn planting season is very time-sensitive, early replanting is necessary to ensure a better harvest.

While replanting, it is also necessary to consider the area required for autumn-sown wheat, as wheat is the main crop in these areas. If one is emphasized at the expense of the other, delaying the timely sowing of wheat and affecting wheat yield, it would be a case of gaining a small advantage at the cost of a large loss.

Late-autumn replanted crops, due to the late sowing and short growing period, should pay attention to improving cultivation techniques and strengthening field management. Especially during the seedling stage, weeds grow extremely fast, so timely cultivation and weeding are even more important.

This year, the disaster-stricken areas have rich experience in replanting late autumn crops and strengthening the management of late autumn crops. In the process of replanting, it is necessary to carefully summarize and promote these experiences.

### 受涝地区赶快补种晚秋作物

    受涝地区赶快补种晚秋作物
    7月上旬，河南、山东、陕西、安徽、江苏、浙江等地，连降暴雨，遭受了水灾，农作物受到一定的损失。
    根据过去几年经验，对受涝较轻或涝后还有一定收成希望的秋苗，不要轻易毁种，应该积极排除积水，进行除烂叶、清泥、中耕培土、追肥，以迅速恢复禾苗生机和争取多收。受灾较重而无收成希望的，应抓紧时机进行补种，这对于弥补受灾损失和缩短灾荒具有重要意义。1954年7月河南省水灾后，补种晚秋七百多万亩，由于加强田间管理，仍获得四成的收成。
    晚秋可以补种的早熟作物很多，在淮河流域一带，荞麦到“处暑”还可以下种，胡萝卜、蔓菁等播种的时间还可以晚一些。长江流域的一些地区在“立秋”前还可以播种秋玉米、晚谷子、晚大豆、秋马铃薯及荞麦、秋菜等，有的地方甚至在“处暑”前还能补种这些晚秋早熟作物。由于晚秋播种季节性很强，及早进行抢种补种，才能保证较好的收成。
    在补种的同时，还必须考虑到秋种小麦所必需的面积，因为小麦是这些地区的主要作物。如果顾此失彼，贻误小麦适时播种，影响小麦产量，也是得不偿失的。
    补种的晚秋作物，由于播种较晚，生育期较短，应注意提高栽培技术和加强田间管理，特别在幼苗时期，杂草生长极快，适时中耕除草就更为重要。
    今年受灾地区，对抢种补种晚秋和加强晚秋管理等方面，都有丰富的经验，在进行补种工作当中，要认真加以总结和推广。
