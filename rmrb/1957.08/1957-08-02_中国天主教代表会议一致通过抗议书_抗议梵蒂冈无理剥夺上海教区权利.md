Xinhua News Agency, 1st Dispatch: The Chinese Catholic Representatives' Conference, currently being held in Beijing, passed a protest letter, protesting the Vatican's unreasonable measures in denying the legitimate acting bishop of the Shanghai Diocese. The protest letter states: "The Roman Curia's order to unreasonably deprive the Shanghai Diocese of its legitimate rights is erroneous, invalid, and absolutely unacceptable."

The protest first states that the Vatican, "disregarding the true situation repeatedly provided by the Shanghai Diocese, insists on denying Zhang Shilang, the legitimate acting bishop elected by the Shanghai Diocese, and promulgates an 'order' granting 'privileges' to those so-called 'peace communicants'. We, the entire body of representatives, with a pious heart loyal to God, have comprehensively and meticulously studied all the letters and telegrams exchanged between the Shanghai Diocese and the Roman Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith since the lawful election of the acting bishop in mid-March 1956. We deeply realize that the measures taken by Rome against the Shanghai Diocese violate the provisions of the Sacred Canon Law and unreasonably deprive the Shanghai Diocese of its due rights. This is entirely an act of discrimination and sabotage against the missionary and soul-saving cause of our Holy Church, and one of the entire political conspiracy means to strike and obstruct the patriotic and religious righteous cause of the clergy and laity in Shanghai and throughout the country, which makes our patriotic clergy and laity who consistently maintain the spirit of the Holy and Catholic Church feel heartbroken and angry."

The protest states: "The Shanghai clergy and laity oppose the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary clique. This is the sacred duty of citizens to love their country and the duty to protect the Church." The lawful election of Zhang Shilang as acting bishop by the Shanghai Diocese "is a correct measure in line with the spiritual welfare of more than 100,000 Catholics in the diocese."

The protest then states that the Vatican actually praised the counter-revolutionary Gong Pinmei as the "most qualified bishop" and slandered our government's arrest of him as an "unreasonable" measure. This is an attempt "to create division and chaos in the Shanghai Diocese and then put the Shanghai Diocese back under counter-revolutionary control."

The protest states that the so-called "peace communicants" to whom the Vatican wants to grant privileges are those who have lost the standpoint of the Chinese people and are traitors who harm the country and the Church. "If the Chinese clergy all become such so-called 'peace communicants,' then our Church will not only be spurned by the people of the whole country, but also be intolerable to the Catholics of the whole country."

The protest concludes: "The Chinese Catholic Representatives' Conference solemnly declares: The lawful election of Zhang Shilang as acting bishop by the Shanghai Diocese is in accordance with the provisions of the canon law and in the interests of the diocese. We fully support the righteous actions of the clergy and laity of the Shanghai Diocese in standing firm on the position of Chinese Catholics, safeguarding the interests of the diocese, and opposing the Roman Curia's sabotage of the Shanghai Diocese. The Roman Curia's 'order' to unreasonably deprive the Shanghai Diocese of its legitimate rights is erroneous, invalid, and absolutely unacceptable."

    中国天主教代表会议一致通过抗议书
    抗议梵蒂冈无理剥夺上海教区权利
    新华社1日讯　正在北京举行的中国天主教代表会议通过一项抗议书，抗议梵蒂冈否认上海教区合法代理主教的无理措施。抗议书说：“罗马教廷无理剥夺上海教区合法权利的命令，是错误的、无效的、决不能接受的”。
    抗议首先说，梵蒂冈“不顾上海教区一再提供的真实情况，坚持否定上海教区选出的合法代理主教张士琅，并颁布授予所谓“和平通功”者以“特权”的“命令”。我们全体代表以忠于天主的虔诚心情，全面而缜密地研究了上海教区自1956年3月中旬依法选举出了代理主教后与罗马传信部来往的全部函电，深刻认识到罗马对上海教区所采取的措施，违背了圣教法典的规定，无理剥夺了上海教区应有的权利，这完全是歧视和破坏我国圣教会传教救灵事业的行为，是打击与阻挠上海和全国神长教友进行爱国爱教正义事业的整个政治阴谋手段之一，使我们一贯保持圣而公教会精神的爱国神长教友感到痛心和愤怒。”
    抗议说：“上海神长教友反对龚品梅反革命集团，这是公民爱国的神圣职责，也是爱护教会当尽的本分。上海教区依法选举张士琅为代理主教，是合乎教区十多万教友灵魂福利的正确措施。”
    抗议接着说，梵蒂冈竟赞扬反革命分子龚品梅为“最称职的主教”，诬蔑我国政府逮捕他是“不合理”的措施，这是企图“在上海教区制造分裂与混乱，再重新把上海教区置于反革命控制之下。”
    抗议说，梵蒂冈要授予特权的所谓“和平通功”者，就是那些丧失中国人民立场的祸国害教的败类。“如果中国神职班都成为这样的所谓‘和平通功’者，那末我们的教会不仅要被全国人民所唾弃，也为全国教友所不容。”
    抗议最后说：“中国天主教代表会议严正地声明：上海教区依法选举张士琅为代理主教，既合乎法典规定，也合乎教区利益。我们完全支持上海教区神长教友这种站稳中国天主教友立场、维护教区利益、反对罗马教廷破坏上海教区的正义行为。罗马教廷无理剥夺上海教区合法权利的‘命令’，是错误的，无效的，决不能接受的。”
