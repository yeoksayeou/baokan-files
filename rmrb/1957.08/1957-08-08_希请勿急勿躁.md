Rightist element Zheng Wanyu of Jiangsu Medical College once uttered a lot of anti-Party, anti-socialist fallacies. When the masses rose up to refute his fallacies, he refused to attend meetings under various pretexts. The leadership criticized him for resisting inspection and not reflecting on his mistakes, but he said the leadership was "close to subjective arbitrariness" and was "forcibly carrying out ideological remolding and study" on him. Recently, he wrote a letter to the China Democratic League branch of the medical college (Zheng is a member of the China Democratic League), saying: "Although my self-criticism has not met objective requirements, the objectively existing reality... and my further experience both require a certain amount of time, as short as three to five months, or as long as three to five years. At present, I have no mature understanding to add, I hope you won't be anxious or impatient." He also said, "Before a reasonable solution is reached, I will not consider participating in social activities," and threatened the China Democratic League branch with withdrawing from the China Democratic League if they continued to criticize him.

Zheng Wanyu's actions are clearly a delaying tactic commonly used by some rightist elements. For those rightist elements who pretend to have "no mature understanding" and refuse to bow their heads and admit their guilt, their shield must be completely shattered. However, it should also be seen that there are indeed some rightist elements who are incorrigible. For such people, there must be no impatience, and even less can we prematurely call it quits. Instead, we must thoroughly expose their ugly nature and completely, cleanly, and totally refute their reactionary fallacies. To this end, "as short as three to five months, or as long as three to five years" is acceptable. In a word, we will never call it quits without a complete victory! After achieving this, if some rightist elements still stubbornly refuse to repent, then we can only let them take their reactionary possessions to their coffins.

    “希请勿急勿躁”
    江苏医学院的右派分子郑万育，曾经大放反党反社会主义厥词。群众起来驳斥他的谬论，他却借故拒绝参加会议。领导上批评他抗拒检查，不思悔改，他却说领导上“迹近主观武断”。是在对他“强迫进行思想改造学习”。最近，他写了一封信给医学院民盟支部（郑系民盟盟员）说：“本人检讨虽未满足客观要求，但客观存在的现实……和本人进一步的体验，均需要一定的时间，短则三、五个月，亦或要三、五年。目下本人无成熟体会可资补充，希请勿急勿躁。”又说“在未能合理解决前，不考虑参加社会活动”。并以退出民盟来要挟民盟支部不再对他进行批判。
    郑万育的作为，显然是一些右派分子惯用的一种拖延战术。对于那些假装“无成熟体会”而拒绝低头认罪的右派分子，必须彻底打破他们的挡箭牌。但是，也应该看到，的确也有一些右派分子是顽固不化的，对于这样的人，就不能有急躁情绪，更不能草率收兵，而必须彻底揭穿他们的丑恶本质，彻底、干净、全部地驳倒他们的反动谬论。为此，“短则三、五个月，亦或要三、五年”都可以。一句话，不获全胜，决不收兵！做到了这点之后，如果有些右派分子依然死不悔改，那只好让他们把他们的反动家当带到棺材里去了。
