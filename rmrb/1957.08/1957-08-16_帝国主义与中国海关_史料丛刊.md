“Imperialism and the Chinese Customs” Historical Materials Series

An Important Resource for Studying Modern Chinese Economic History: The "Imperialism and the Chinese Customs" Historical Materials Series is being compiled and edited by the Research Office of the General Administration of Customs. Among them, the fourth series, "The Chinese Customs and the Sino-French War," has been published by the Science Press.

For more than ninety years under the control of imperialism, the Chinese Customs accumulated approximately 170,000 volumes of archives, mostly in English. These archives record the crimes of imperialism in invading China over the past century, particularly the conspiracies of imperialism to carry out economic and political aggression against China by using the customs apparatus. These archives were secretly kept by the Inspectorate General of Customs before liberation and were never made public. Their main contents include: 1. The origin and evolution of foreign management of the Chinese Customs. 2. The situation of imperialism seizing China's customs autonomy. 3. The inside story of the Inspector General of Customs—imperialist agents—interfering in China's diplomacy. 4. Imperialism's manipulation of China's financial affairs after seizing the right to keep and use Chinese customs duties. 5. Imperialism's interference in China's internal affairs through the customs. 6. The smuggling situation, the establishment of anti-smuggling agencies, and the anti-smuggling fleet. 7. Foreign personnel using customs positions to engage in espionage activities.

In the past few years, through the joint efforts of the General Administration of Customs and the Shanghai Customs, a portion of the above historical materials has been translated into Chinese. Now, under the guidance of the Third Institute of the Institute of History of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Research Office of the General Administration of Customs of the Ministry of Foreign Trade is further supplementing and collating these materials, preparing to publish the historical materials before 1911 in separate volumes under the title "Imperialism and the Chinese Customs." Among them, in addition to the already published fourth series, "The Chinese Customs and the Sino-French War," another series, "The Chinese Customs and the Burma-Tibet Question, 1885-1894," has also been compiled. The remaining series are planned to be completed in 1958. As for how to continue compiling the customs historical materials for the nearly forty years after the 1911 Revolution, the General Administration of Customs of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and the Editorial Committee of the Series of Materials on Modern Chinese Economic History are studying the issue.

    “帝国主义与中国海关”史料丛刊
    研究我国近代经济史的重要资料——“帝国主义与中国海关”史料丛刊，正在由海关总署研究室整理编辑，其中第四编“中国海关与中法战争”，已由科学出版社出版。
    中国海关在帝国主义控制下的九十余年中，存有档案约十七万卷，大半是英文的，这些档案记载了过去百年间帝国主义的侵华罪行，特别是帝国主义利用海关机构对中国进行经济政治侵略的阴谋活动。这些档案在解放前由总税务司署秘密保管，从未公布过，它的主要内容包括：一、外国人管理中国海关的起源和沿革。二、帝国主义攫夺我国海关自主权的情形。三、海关总税务司——帝国主义代理人干涉中国外交的内幕活动。四、帝国主义攫夺中国关税保管使用权后对中国财政金融的操纵。五、帝国主义通过海关对中国内政的干涉。六、走私情况，缉私机构和缉私舰队的建立经过。七、洋员利用海关职位进行特务谍报活动。
    在过去几年里，经过海关总署和上海海关的通力合作，已将上述史料的一部分译成中文。现在对外贸易部海关总署研究室在科学院历史研究所第三所的指导下，正进一步的补充和整理，准备将1911年以前的史料以“帝国主义与中国海关”为题，先行分册付印。其中除四编“中国海关与中法战争”已经出版外，另一编“1885—1894年中国海关和缅藏问题”也已编好。其余几编计划在1958年内全部编好。至于辛亥革命以后将近四十年的海关史料如何继续编写问题，对外贸易部海关总署和中国近代经济史资料丛刊编委会正在研究中。
