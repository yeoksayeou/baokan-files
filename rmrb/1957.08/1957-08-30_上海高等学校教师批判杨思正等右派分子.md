Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 29th. Recently, Marxist-Leninist teachers in Shanghai universities and colleges have held successive conferences to expose and criticize a group of rightist elements hidden within the ranks of Marxist-Leninist teachers.

    Yang Sizheng and Shen Lüjun, rightist elements from the East China Institute of Textile Technology, echoed each other. Yang Sizheng said: "Now we are still talking about the theories of Marx and Engels from fifty years ago, which is against reality and conscience." Shen Lüjun followed by saying: "Marxism-Leninism is a school of thought, only one among 'a hundred schools of thought contending,' and should not be used as our guiding ideology." Yang Sizheng cursed that the new China "has no democracy," and Shen Lüjun said: "If the Communist Party is gone, the Three Great Ideologies will also be gone." Ouyang Zhijian, a rightist element from the Shanghai Institute of Physical Education, wrote nine reactionary articles, saying that "it is forever impossible to achieve the correction of the Party's work style through rectification." Wang Shizhang, a rightist element from the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, even wanted to write a book to "expose" the "shortcomings" of new China.

    The teachers present expressed that, in order to defend the great cause of socialism and communism, they must better master the weapon of Marxism-Leninism and thoroughly defeat these rightist elements.

    上海高等学校教师批判杨思正等右派分子
    据新华社上海29日电　上海高等学校马列主义课教师最近连续举行大会，揭露和批判隐匿在马列主义教师队伍里的一批右派分子。
    华东纺织工学院右派分子杨思正和沈履君互相呼应。杨思正说：“现在我们还讲五十年前的马克思恩格斯理论是违背现实和良心”。沈履君接着说：“马克思列宁主义是一个学派，只是‘百家争鸣’中的一家，不应作为我们的指导思想”。杨思正骂新中国“没有民主”，沈履君就说：“共产党没有了，三大主义也就没有了。”上海体育学院右派分子欧阳志坚写了九篇反动文章，说什么“通过整风达到改正党的作风是永远不可能的”。上海财经学院右派分子王士章更要专门写一部书来“揭发”新中国的“缺点”。
    到会的教师们表示，为了捍卫社会主义和共产主义的伟大事业，他们要更好地掌握马克思列宁主义的武器，彻底打垮这些右派分子。
