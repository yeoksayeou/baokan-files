Bumper Harvest of Sea Salt

(Our report) This year, the three major sea salt regions of Liaoning, Hangu, and Tangda, with the support of the People's Liberation Army, have achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of spring-dried salt, with actual yields breaking all previous historical records.

As of August 10, Liaoning's salt production had exceeded the annual plan by 22.15%, Hangu had exceeded the annual plan by 2.91%, and Tangda had also exceeded it by 1.36%. Because the output of these three major sea salt regions accounts for more than 40% of the country's planned output of crude salt, the supply and export of crude salt in the future will be greatly guaranteed. Currently, each region is actively carrying out mid-season drying and preparing for autumn drying on the basis of the bumper harvest, in order to strive for even greater overfulfillment.

During the spring drying production period, Liaoning, Tangda, and Hangu all had the support of PLA troops stationed on the beaches. Military and industrial workers learned from each other, influenced each other, and fought side by side, becoming the main factor in achieving a bumper harvest. In particular, the achievements of Unit 0218 in the Tangda and Hangu salt regions were even more remarkable. This unit dispatched 2,500 people to nine salt fields, working alongside tens of thousands of salt workers on 667 plots of land for two months, helping each plot transport and collect more than 340,000 tons of crude salt. They also helped each plot complete tasks such as raking, covering, pond maintenance, and beach repair during this period, saving enterprises more than 130,000 yuan in wages alone. They also assisted salt workers in producing more than 100,000 tons of crude salt, increasing enterprise income by nearly 2 million yuan and increasing national fiscal revenue by more than 10 million yuan.

The PLA officers and soldiers' high degree of organization, discipline, initiative, and creativity greatly influenced the salt industry workers. Many workers further raised their class consciousness, the backward became advanced, and the advanced became even more advanced. The troops also learned production techniques such as pushing salt, raking salt, raking brine, and pond maintenance from the workers. The troops and salt workers combined the competition of the two systems, promoting each other, and achieving great results. Therefore, the slogan "Military and workers unite tightly, seawater turns into silver" has not only become a mutually trusted covenant, but also a folk song praising the unity of military and workers.

### 海盐丰收

    海盐丰收
    本报讯　今年辽宁、汉沽、塘大三个主要海盐区，在解放军的支援下，春晒空前丰收，实际产量都突破了有史以来的最高纪录。
    截至8月10日止，辽宁产盐已超额完成年计划22.15％，汉沽已超额完成年计划2.91％，塘大也超额完成1.36％。由于这三个主要海盐区的产量占全国原盐计划产量40％以上，所以今后的原盐供应与出口均增强了保证。现各区正在丰产基础上，积极进行伏晒并准备秋晒，以争取更大超额。
    辽宁、塘大、汉沽在春晒生产时期均有解放军驻滩支援，军工互相学习，互相影响，并肩作战成为取得丰产的主要因素。特别是0218部队在塘大和汉沽两盐区取得的成绩更为显著。这个部队抽出二千五百人分别驻到九个盐场，在667付滩田上和上万盐工一起工作了两个月，帮助各滩推运集坨的原盐在三十四万吨以上。还帮助各滩完成了这一时期的撩玛、封苫、整池、修滩等任务，单是工资一项即节省企业开支十三万多元，并协助盐工争取多产了上十万吨原盐，增加企业收入将近二百万元，增加国家财政收入在一千万元以上。
    解放军官兵的高度组织性、纪律性和积极性、创造性，大大影响了盐业职工，很多职工进一步提高了阶级觉悟，落后的变为先进，先进的更加先进。部队官兵也向工人学习了推盐、扒盐、撩玛、整池……等生产技术。部队和盐工通过两个系统的竞赛互相结合互相推动，收到很大效果。因此，“军工团结紧，海水变白银”的口号不仅已成为共同信赖的公约，也成了群众赞颂军工团结的歌谣。（附图片）
