　　Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, August 22nd: American sailors are once again committing assaults and beating people in Hong Kong.
　　The Hong Kong "Ta Kung Pao" reported on the 21st that two American sailors assaulted a Chinese taxi driver. On the evening of the 20th, these two American sailors hired a car from Yongan Motor Company. After arriving at their destination, Lockhart Road in Wan Chai, they refused to pay the fare. When the driver, Feng Zhong, argued with them, they severely beat him, causing head injuries. The American sailors fled after the assault.
　　According to a report in the Hong Kong "New Evening News" on the 21st, at 3:00 AM on the 21st, three American sailors were wandering around Jaffe Road in Wan Chai, trying to find someone to find them "girls." When they failed to fulfill their wishes, they chased and beat people along the way. A Chinese resident named Feng Wenru was unable to escape and was surrounded and beaten by them. The assaulting American sailors left only after he fell to the ground with serious injuries.
　　Less than three months ago, three American sailors assaulted and injured a Chinese woman named Huang Meili, who lived nearby on Gloucester Road in Wan Chai. Hong Kong newspapers have described the Gloucester Road area in Hong Kong as a "horrifying area" because whenever American warships are docked, acts of violence by American soldiers often occur there.

　　美国水兵在香港行凶打人
    新华社香港22日电　美国水兵又在香港行凶殴人。
    香港“大公报”21日报道了两个美国水兵殴打中国汽车司机的事实。这两个美国水兵在20日晚上雇了一辆永安汽车公司的汽车，到达目的地湾仔洛克道后，没有交付车资，司机冯忠和他们纠缠，便被他们痛殴至头部受伤。美兵行凶后逃去。
    另据香港“新晚报”21日报道，21日早晨三时，有三个美国水兵在湾仔谢斐道到处找人为他们找寻“大姑娘”，未遂他们的心愿，他们便在途中追人殴打。一个叫冯文儒的中国居民因走避不及，被他们围殴，直到重伤倒地后行凶的美兵才离开。
    在不到三个月前，曾有三个美国水兵在湾仔高士打道把一个住在附近的中国妇女黄美梨殴伤。香港报纸曾把香港高士打道区域形容为“可怖区域”，因为那里每当美国兵舰泊岸时，便常常发生美国兵行凶闹事的暴行。
