    The Anti-Party Drums Were Broken, But They Still Want to Make a Comeback:
    Zhong Dianfei's Anti-Party Activities Suffer Another Setback
    (Reported by this newspaper) Beijing film circles held five consecutive symposiums from August 5th to 15th, further exposing the anti-Party activities of rightist Zhong Dianfei.
    Many facts revealed at the meetings proved that Zhong Dianfei's claim to "respect film tradition" was essentially an attempt to use his decadent and vulgar bourgeois views to transform the people's film industry. Not only did he advocate reducing the number of films with worker-peasant-soldier themes, but also when the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio was shooting the film "Acrobatic Art," he wanted a female actress, who was originally scheduled to wear long clothes and trousers, to perform in a bra and briefs, believing that "the more flesh exposed, the better." He maliciously attacked a talented young actress, saying that her figure lacked curves and she could not act at all. He even advocated that we might as well shoot some bare-chested and semi-nude scenes in our films, shamelessly saying, "It doesn't matter if young people see this."
    Shi Lianxing, Xie Tian, Li Keng, and others used their own personal experiences to refute Zhong Dianfei's lies that the Party does not value the training of film actors. Xie Tian said, "I am already forty-four years old this year. After liberation, not only did I shoot some films, but the leadership also sent me to the Film Academy to study for two years. This was simply impossible in the old society." Bai Yang and Sang Hu, in a joint statement, exposed Zhong Dianfei's conspiracy to provoke discord between film art creation cadres and leaders. The joint statement by military film workers Chen Bo, Yu Ji, and Xia Chuan also refuted Zhong Dianfei's fallacy that "soldiers don't like to watch war films," and cited many facts to prove that Zhong Dianfei had also used various despicable means to provoke discord between the Film Bureau and the August First Film Studio.
    At yesterday's meeting, Zhou Wenbo of Wenyi Bao (Literary Gazette) handed over a batch of secret letters that Zhong Dianfei had sent to Zhou after his article "The Drums of Film" was criticized. From these secret letters, it can be seen that Zhong Dianfei used the same tone as Hu Feng to insult and hate the leadership, and to hate all the systems of the art departments. He specifically instructed him to attack the Shanghai Drama Association, the Peking Opera Theater, and the People's Art Theater, and also designated him to visit those actors and directors to gather information as material for his attack on the Party. He hoped that Zhou Wenbo would re-ignite a discussion on film issues in Shanghai, asking Zhou to "exchange opinions with the film personalities in Shanghai: whether to do it, if so how?" The next day, he wrote to Zhou Wenbo to encourage him, saying that if a discussion were to arise, he was willing to "invade with all forces." But because his rightist face had long been exposed, he regretfully said, "If there is a discussion, I can't be the commander!" After the anti-rightist struggle began, he also wrote to Zhou Wenbo, telling him that before returning to Beijing, he "must cast a large net in the film field, so as to catch them in the future." He also said, "I really want – urgently want to know: what is Shanghai's attitude towards raising the film issue again? If they cannot actively support us, half the country will be finished. If the front line attacks, but there is no one to follow up, you can imagine how embarrassing it will be." Zhong Dianfei's desire to make a comeback and fight for "the country" was completely exposed. However, in the so-called self-criticism that Zhong Dianfei made at the meeting on August 8, which lasted as long as three hours, his attitude was extremely insincere, and he did not confess many of his criminal activities, which aroused the anger of the comrades present. Cai Chusheng, Chen Huangmei, Li Ni, Huang Gang, Yi Ming, Shi Lin and others unanimously pointed out that Zhong Dianfei was deliberately evading the important points and trying to muddle through, and warned him to take his mistakes seriously, make a thorough confession to the Party, and not cut himself off from the people.
    The symposium will continue.

### 反党锣鼓敲破了还想卷土重来  钟惦棐反党活动又告挫败

    反党锣鼓敲破了还想卷土重来
    钟惦棐反党活动又告挫败
    本报讯  北京电影界从本月5日至15日连续举行了五次座谈会，进一步揭发了右派分子钟惦棐的反党活动。
    会上揭露的许多事实证明：钟惦棐扬言要“尊重电影传统”，实质上不过是企图用他的腐朽庸俗的资产阶级观点来改造人民电影事业。他不但提倡削减工农兵题材的影片，在中央新闻纪录电影制片厂拍摄“杂技艺术”这部影片时，他还要一位原定穿长衣长裤的女演员改着乳罩、三角裤表演，认为“肉愈露得多愈好”。他恶意地攻击一位有才能的青年女演员，说她体型不够曲线，根本不能演戏。他甚至主张在我们的影片中不妨也拍一些袒胸露肩的半裸镜头，无耻地说，“这给青年看看也没有关系。”
    石联星、谢添、黎铿等以自己亲身经历，驳斥了钟惦棐所说的党不重视培养电影演员的谰言。谢添说，“我今年已经四十四岁了。解放后我不但拍了一些片子，领导上还送我到电影学院去学习了两年。这在旧社会是根本不可能的。”白杨和桑弧在联合发言中，揭穿了钟惦棐企图挑拨电影艺术创作干部和领导之间的关系的阴谋。部队电影工作者陈播、虞棘、夏川的联合发言，也驳斥了钟惦棐所说的“士兵不爱看打仗的影片”的谬论，并且举出许多事实，证明钟惦棐也曾经用各种卑劣手段来挑拨电影局和八一电影制片厂的关系。
    在昨天的大会上，文艺报周文博交出了钟惦棐给“电影的锣鼓”一文受到批评以后给周的一批密信。从这些密信里，可以看出，钟惦棐用像胡风一样的口气辱骂和仇恨领导，仇恨艺术部门的一切制度。他具体指示他向上海剧协、京剧院、人民艺术剧院等处进攻，还指定他去访问那些演员、导演，打探情况，以作为自己向党进攻的材料。他希望周文博在上海重新掀起一次关于电影问题的讨论，要周去和“上海的电影闻人交换一下意见：搞不搞，要搞，怎样搞？”次日又给周文博写信打气，说如讨论起来，愿意“倾巢出犯”。但由于他的右派面目早已暴露，所以，又惋惜地说：“讨论起来，我是不能挂帅了！”反右派斗争开始以后，他还给周文博去信说，要他在回北京之前，“必须在电影方面撒下一个大网，以便日后写信去抓他们”。还说，“我很想——急于知道：上海方面对电影问题的再提起态度如何？如果他们不能积极支持我们，半壁江山，也就完了。前线出击，后继无人，其尴尬你是可以想见的。”钟惦棐要卷土重来，要争“江山”的面目完全暴露了。可是钟惦棐在8月8日的会上所作的长达三小时的所谓检讨中，态度极不老实，许多罪恶活动都未交代，引起了到会同志的愤怒。蔡楚生、陈荒煤、丽尼、黄钢、伊明、史林等一致指出：钟惦棐是有意避重就轻，企图蒙混过关，并且警告他必须认真对待自己的错误，向党彻底交代，不要自绝于人民。
    座谈会仍将继续进行。
