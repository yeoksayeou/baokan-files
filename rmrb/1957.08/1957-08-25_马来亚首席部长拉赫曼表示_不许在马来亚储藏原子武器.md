Xinhua News Agency, August 24th, Kuala Lumpur Dispatch: Malayan Federation Chief Minister Rahman said on the evening of August 23rd that Malaya will not allow atomic weapons to be stored on its territory.

When asked about his opinion on British Defense Minister Sandys' speech in Australia on August 20th, Rahman also said that Malaya had not agreed to hold a meeting with Britain to discuss the issue of arming British troops stationed in Malaya with nuclear weapons. He said that if Britain made a suggestion, we would most likely reject it.

Sandys said at that time that Britain would equip its troops stationed in the Far East with atomic weapons.

Many political parties and youth organizations in Malaya have passed resolutions protesting Britain's attempt to transport atomic weapons into Malaya.

    马来亚首席部长拉赫曼表示
　　不许在马来亚储藏原子武器
    据新华社24日讯　吉隆坡消息：马来亚联合邦首席部长拉赫曼8月23日晚间说，马来亚将不允许在它的领土上储藏原子武器。
    拉赫曼在被问到他对英国国防大臣桑迪斯8月20日在澳大利亚发表的谈话的意见时还说，马来亚没有同意过要同英国举行会议，来讨论用核武器武装驻在马来亚的英国军队的问题。他说，假如英国有所建议，我们多半会拒绝它。
    桑迪斯那时说，英国将用原子武器装备它驻在远东的部队。
    马来亚的许多政党和青年组织纷纷通过决议，抗议英国企图把原子武器运进马来亚。
