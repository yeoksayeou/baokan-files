Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 5th: Chinese and American youth held their second meeting at the Soviet Agricultural Exhibition restaurant during the festival today. This meeting was suggested by the Chinese youth delegation.

    Hu Yaobang, head of the Chinese delegation, spoke first. He said, "We are very happy to meet with American youth here again today. We hope to have a third, fourth, and hundreds more meetings."

    American representative Williamson then spoke. He said, "We who are fortunate enough to come to Moscow are very happy to meet with the Chinese representatives. We believe that meetings like this will help consolidate the world peace we cherish and strengthen the friendship between the people of all countries." He pointed out that only in a peaceful environment can we work together to achieve progress in human civilization.

    A lively conversation then began. These young people, who disregarded the obstruction of the American government and overcame many difficulties to participate in the festival, were extremely interested in all aspects of China, but did not understand many issues.

    The conversation was proceeding enthusiastically. They talked about school life, their own family life, literature and art, virtually everything. While talking, they enjoyed the programs performed by the youth of the two countries, ate Chinese peanuts and lotus seed candy, and exchanged souvenirs.

    中美青年再次欢聚
    谈政治大事也谈家庭生活
    据新华社莫斯科5日电　中、美两国青年今天在苏联农业展览会餐厅举行联欢节上的第二次会见。这次是中国青年代表建议举行的。
    中国代表团团长胡耀邦首先讲话。他说，我们今天十分高兴在这里同美国青年进行再一次见面。我们希望还有第三次、第四次、几百次的见面。
    美国代表威廉逊接着讲了话。他说，我们这些幸运地来到莫斯科的人能同中国代表会见，感到很高兴。我们相信，像这样的会见有助于巩固我们所热爱的世界和平和加强世界各国人民的友谊。他指出，只有在和平的环境里共同劳动，才能取得人类文明的进展。
    随后开始了热烈的谈话。这批不顾美国政府阻挠、克服许多困难、前来参加联欢节的青年，对中国各方面的情况都抱着极大的兴趣，但是对许多问题都不了解。
    交谈在热烈地进行着。他们谈到了学校生活，自己的家庭生活，文学艺术，可以说是无所不谈。他们一面谈一面欣赏着两国青年表演的节目，吃着中国的花生米、莲子糖，互相交换纪念品。
