The solemn and serene goddesses in the Sacred Mother Temple on Mount Hua slowly opened their eyes, gracefully stretched their limbs, and descended from the empty and lonely altar... The dance drama "Lotus Lantern" performed by the Central Experimental Opera House Dance Troupe thus brought the audience into a beautiful mythical realm with imagination and poetry. From the resurrection of the statues to their return to silence, the more dramatic arrangements were made for Liu Yanchang's lodging in the temple, admiring the fairy appearance of the Third Holy Mother, and writing poems. After a duet between Liu Yanchang and the Third Holy Mother expressing their mutual love, the ferocious Erlang Shen brought哮天犬 (Xiàotiānquǎn) to interfere with the Third Holy Mother's happiness, wanting to drive Liu Yanchang away. Although the Third Holy Mother used the Lotus Lantern to force Erlang Shen away, she followed Liu Yanchang to live a happy life in the human world; however, the audience could fully understand that their future suffering was already foreshadowed here! The plot of the dance drama "Lotus Lantern" is very compact from the beginning.

Just as relatives and friends were celebrating Chenxiang's 100th day, 哮天犬 (Xiàotiānquǎn) disguised himself as a congratulatory guest and stole the Lotus Lantern, and the situation changed abruptly. When Erlang Shen ruthlessly captured the Third Holy Mother, the audience was deeply moved by the tragedy of the couple's separation and the mother and son's separation. The scene of Chenxiang cultivating the Tao on the fairy mountain is not just a narrative of the process, but a profound and moving depiction of Chenxiang's mood of saving his mother. Using the method of the great immortal's guidance, Chenxiang entered a fantasy realm, and from the contrast of the group of children, he realized the loneliness of his own life experience. At this time, the image of the Third Holy Mother suddenly appeared, and when the mother and son embraced affectionately, the ferocious Erlang Shen kicked him awake... This scene not only used better dance drama expression techniques, but also had a simple and sincere human touch.

The performance of the dance drama "Lotus Lantern" signifies a major achievement in the creative practice of national dance drama. This is not only because "Lotus Lantern" is a complete large-scale dance drama, but also because in the artistic creation of the dance drama "Lotus Lantern," the difficult problem of using traditional national dance techniques to structure new dance drama chapters has been better solved.

Dance drama is an art form combining music, dance, and mime. The characters in dance drama are created through some dance postures and movements. It must gradually enter a climax through the continuity and transformation of dramatic scenes, and the whole article must also become an artistic whole through a special structural form. All life experiences in the play are profoundly depicted by musicians and then truthfully expressed by actors. The dance drama "Lotus Lantern" has summarized and created certain achievements in these aspects.

Judging from the "Stealing the Immortal Herb," "Liu Hai Plays with the Toad," "By the碧莲池 (Bìliánchí) Pond," and this performance of "Lotus Lantern" by the Central Experimental Opera House Dance Troupe, they have a clear creative path. That is to start with folk tale themes familiar to the masses to carry out the construction of dance dramas. To develop new national forms of dance drama on the basis of traditional opera. Of course, this does not exclude the expression of new life content. I think they will also be able to create dance dramas reflecting real life in the future, and they will also have their own unique style.

The art of dance drama has just been established, and there are still many problems to be solved, just as the performance of "Lotus Lantern" cannot be perfect. For example, how to better create character images in dance drama music; dance drama music must be poetic, and also dramatic; it is necessary to create scenes to create atmosphere, and sometimes also clear and symmetrical rhythms, and everything must be subordinate to a complete theme, the rhythm and rhythm of Chinese national classical dance are relatively complex and delicate and have very distinct characteristics, etc., all need to be boldly broken through and created on the basis of bold application.

　　舞剧“宝莲灯”的演出
　　序纯
    华山圣母庙里，庄严静穆的女神们，缓慢地睁开了眼睛，婀娜地舒展着肢体，走下了空虚寂寞的神台……中央实剧歌剧院舞剧团演出的舞剧“宝莲灯”就这样富有想像和诗意的把观众们带入到一个美丽的神话意境。从神像的复活又归于岑寂，为刘彦昌入庙投宿、瞻仰三圣母的仙容和题诗等情节，作了更浓厚的戏剧性的安排。在刘彦昌和三圣母一段互相爱悦的双人舞之后，凶暴的二郎神却带着哮天犬来干预三圣母的幸福，要赶走刘彦昌。三圣母虽用宝莲灯逼走了二郎神，跟随刘彦昌去过人间的幸福生活；但观众们却完全能够理解这里已经预伏下了他们未来的苦难！舞剧“宝莲灯”的情节，一开始就是十分紧凑的。
    正当亲友们欢庆沉香的百日，哮天犬却化装贺客偷盗走了宝莲灯，情境遽变。当二郎神冷酷无情的抓走三圣母时，观众们深为他们夫妻惨别母子分离的悲恸而感动。沉香在仙山修道一场，不仅只是过程的铺叙，而是把沉香救母的心情作了深刻动人的描写。运用大仙指点的方法，沉香进入幻境，从群童的对比中感悟到自己身世的孤零，此时三圣母的形象悠忽出现，当母子亲切的拥抱，凶暴的二郎神一脚把他踢醒……这一场不但运用了较好的舞剧表现手法，而且有着淳厚的人情味。
    舞剧“宝莲灯”的演出，意味着民族舞剧的创作实践中较大的收获。这不仅仅因为“宝莲灯”是一个完整的大型舞剧，还因为在舞剧“宝莲灯”的艺术创造中，较好地解决了运用民族传统的舞蹈技艺结构成为新的舞剧篇章的繁难问题。
    舞剧是通过音乐、舞蹈、哑剧三者所结合的一种艺术形式。舞剧中的人物形象是通过一些舞蹈姿态和动作来创造的。它必须通过戏剧场景的连续和转换逐渐进入高潮，通篇还要通过一种特殊的结构形式，成为一个艺术的整体。剧中全部生活的体验，是经过音乐家的深刻描写，然后由演员真实的表现出来的。舞剧“宝莲灯”在这些方面，都总结和创造出了一定的成绩。
    从中央实验歌剧院舞剧团所演出过的“盗仙草”，“刘海戏蟾”，“碧莲池畔”，以及这次演出的“宝莲灯”来看，他们有着一条鲜明的创作道路。这就是从群众熟悉的民间传说题材入手，来进行舞剧的建树工作。从传统戏曲的基础之上来发展新的民族形式的舞剧。自然，这并不排斥表现新的生活内容。我想将来他们也同样可以创作反映现实生活的舞剧，并且同样会具有他们自己的独特的风格。
    舞剧艺术刚刚建立，需要解决的问题还很多，正如同“宝莲灯”的演出不可能是十分完善的一样。比如在舞剧音乐上如何更好的创造人物形象；舞剧的音乐除了是诗的，还须是戏剧性的；要创造情景烘托气氛，有时又要明确均称的节奏，一切又必须服从于一个完整的主题，中国民族古典舞蹈的律动和节奏，是比较复杂细致而具有非常鲜明的特色等等，都需要在大胆运用的基础之上大胆的突破和创造。
