　　Autumn Apples Available for Mid-Autumn Festival

　　(Our report) Gaiping and Fuxian counties in Liaoning are major apple producing areas. This year, early-ripening apples such as "Zhu Guang", "Hong Kui", "Huang Kui", "Asahi", and "Dan Ding" produced in these two counties have been on the market in large quantities. As of August 8th, purchasing departments had acquired more than 10 million jin. The quality of the apples is better this year, the export qualification rate has improved, and the variety of export products has also increased.

　　In order to ensure that consumers in various regions can enjoy autumn apples during the Mid-Autumn Festival, the purchasing departments and production cooperatives are studying the possibility of harvesting a portion of "Hong Yu" apples earlier and transporting them to major cities to provide consumers with a taste of the new harvest during the Mid-Autumn Festival.

　　中秋节可以吃到秋苹果
    本报讯　辽宁盖平、复县是盛产苹果的主要产区，今年该两县产的早熟“祝光”、红奎、黄奎、朝日、单顶等苹果已先后大量登市，截至8月8日止，收购部门已收购了一千多万斤。今年苹果的质量较好，出口合格率提高了，出口的品种也增加了。
    为了使各地消费者在中秋佳节能吃到秋苹果，收购部门与生产社研究将“红玉”苹果提前下树一部分，运往各大城市供给消费者中秋佳节尝新。　（景玉德）
