　　Launching a Frenzied Attack on the Party in a "Leftist" Guise:
　　Xie Qingliang's True Colors Exposed

　　(Our dispatch) According to the Chongqing Daily: After nearly a month of struggle, the rightist Xie Qingliang of the First Mechanical Trade Union of the Chongqing Federation of Trade Unions has been completely defeated in his attack on the Party.

　　During the period of great blooming and contending, Xie Qingliang wantonly slandered the Party Central Committee for committing "line errors," saying that the Party only proposed the general line in 1952, which was "revisionism." He also said that the people's democratic dictatorship was also a "line error," and the Party's policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming the bourgeoisie was a "policy of compromise." He also falsely accused the Party Central Committee's "organizational line" of being wrong and "abandoning the principle of democratic centralism." Therefore, he believed that "the key lies in the central government promoting democracy." He deliberately negated the achievements of the Chinese revolution and distorted the rectification movement as a "complete change." Xie Qingliang also maliciously provoked the relationship between the Chinese Communist Party and the international communist movement and provoked Sino-Soviet relations. In his work, Xie Qingliang also sabotaged the Party's policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming the national bourgeoisie, appearing in a "leftist" guise, and inciting workers to beat up three small egg business owners. When the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions criticized him for this behavior as violating policy, he also believed that there was an error in implementing the policy toward the bourgeoisie.

　　In order to completely smash the frantic attack of the rightist Xie Qingliang, starting from early July, under the leadership of the Party group of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, cadres were organized to study and analyze Xie Qingliang's reactionary views. At the same time, cadres of the First Mechanical Trade Union went deep into the factories and enterprises where Xie Qingliang had worked to collect evidence of his reactionary activities, and held small, medium, and large meetings in succession to launch reasoning struggles. People exposed Xie Qingliang's ugly history. It turned out that he had joined a Trotskyist organization in Shanghai as early as 1948. During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement in 1955, he was forced to confess his counter-revolutionary identity, and the organization gave him lenient treatment and did not punish him; but he continued to spread counter-revolutionary remarks and carry out sabotage activities. Everyone systematically refuted Xie Qingliang's reactionary Trotskyist "theories" and sharply exposed his various despicable tactics in attempting to muddle through the anti-rightist struggle.

　　Xie Qingliang has completely exposed his true colors among the masses and has had to admit that the truth is on the side of the Communist Party, expressing his desire to be a new person.

　  以“左”的姿态向党猖狂进攻
　　谢卿梁原形毕露
    本报讯　据重庆日报报道：经过近一个月的斗争，重庆市工会联合会第一机械工会的右派分子谢卿梁对党的进攻已经完全被击败。
    在大鸣大放期间，谢卿梁大肆诬蔑党中央犯了“路线错误”，说党在1952年才提出总路线，这是“修正主义”。又说人民民主专政也是“路线错误”，党对资产阶级的利用、限制、改造的政策是“妥协政策”。还诬蔑说党中央的“组织路线”也有错误，“放弃了民主集中制的原则”。因此，他认为“关键在于中央发扬民主”。他蓄意否定中国革命成就，歪曲整风是要来个“全面改变”。谢卿梁还恶意挑拨中国共产党和国际共产主义运动的关系，挑拨中苏关系。谢卿梁并在工作中，破坏党对民族资产阶级的利用、限制、改造政策，以“左”的姿态出现，鼓动过工人殴打三个蛋行小业主，当市工会批评他这种行为是违反政策时，他还认为执行对资产阶级政策有错误。
    为了彻底粉碎右派分子谢卿梁的疯狂进攻，从7月上旬开始，由市工会党组领导，组织干部研究分析了谢卿梁的反动观点，同时，第一机械工会的干部深入到谢卿梁工作过的工厂企业，搜集他的反动活动，连续召开小型、中型和大型会议展开说理斗争。人们揭露了谢卿梁的丑恶历史，原来他在1948年就在上海参加了托派组织。1955年肃反运动期间，他被迫坦白了反革命身份，组织上宽大处理，未予处分；但他继续散布反革命言论，进行破坏活动。大家系统地驳斥了谢卿梁反动的托派“理论”，并尖锐地揭露了他在反右派斗争中企图蒙混过关的种种卑鄙手法。
    谢卿梁在群众中已完全暴露了原形，不得不承认真理在共产党这一方面，表示要重新作人。
