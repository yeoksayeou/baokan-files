The ugly words and deeds of the bourgeois right-wing elements in the engineering and technical circles who oppose the Communist Party and socialism have recently been exposed by the staff of the central industrial ministries. These right-wing elements took the opportunity of the Communist Party's rectification campaign to attack and slander the Communist Party and vainly attempted to abolish the Party's leadership over the engineering and technical departments.

	Wang Guangying
	Slandered that "the Communist Party has deteriorated"
	Wang Guangying, a right-wing element in the Nonferrous Metals Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, slandered that "the Communist Party has deteriorated" and that a few Party members have exploited the value created by 600 million people. He slandered that many Communist Party ministers, bureau chiefs, section chiefs, and department heads were "incompetent." The ministers only "sign, listen to reports, and assign tasks," "cannot come up with" solutions, and only play a "typesetting" role. However, Wang Guangying, a probationary technician who just graduated from school the year before last, believed that he "could be" a bureau chief.
	Wang Guangying regarded this kind of reactionary remarks as the "truth" he discovered. He vainly hoped that a "Hungarian incident" would occur in China, so as to take the opportunity to "push the Communist Party off the stage."

	Xu Fa
	Said that ideological remolding is "absolutely impermissible"
	Xu Fa, a right-wing element and technician in the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, slandered Communist Party members as "experts who rise rapidly in officialdom," with the imperial thought of "I am the state." He also said that today "the contradiction between the Party and the people is the main contradiction."
	Xu Fa falsely claimed that the Communist Party's ideological remolding of intellectuals was "making trouble out of nothing" and "had more harm than good." The result was that "knowledge" became "sin," and the relationship between the Party and the masses was damaged. Therefore, he called for ideological remolding to be "absolutely impermissible."
	Xu Fa also slandered the socialist system, saying that our country was becoming "poorer and poorer with more construction." The anti-rightist movement "destroyed the rule of law." He also claimed to organize a political party and advocated that China "take the road of the United States" economically.

	Wang Enming
	Said that "the Party fundamentally cannot lead technology"
	Wang Enming, who wears the cloak of a Chinese glass "authority" but actually has very little knowledge of the entire glass industry, especially new varieties and technologies, was originally a right-wing element who consistently opposed the Communist Party and socialism. In the Ministry of Building Materials Industry, he openly slandered Communist Party leading cadres, saying that they "can only fight guerrilla warfare in the mountains and fundamentally cannot lead technology." The Communist Party cadres' "knowledge is low" and they cannot lead intellectuals. He said, "Revolutionary cadres understand peasants" because "peasants don't have much knowledge." He viciously slandered that the Communist Party "cannot let intellectuals speak" and instilled people with "transmissionism from above and movement from below." He also said, "No engineer voluntarily participated in the revolution." He himself could not play a "role."
	Wang Enming also touted the so-called "democracy and freedom" of American capitalism. He said, "Everything is good in the United States," even "the mailroom system is better than China's." He said, "Black people in the United States are naturally oppressed people and are slaves of white people."

	Chen Dingwai
	Advocated turning the Party into a party of intellectuals
	Chen Dingwai, an engineer at the Design Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, viciously slandered the Communist Party as "incompetent" and said that it "has neither talent nor virtue." He also said that "the democratic parties are no less than the Communist Party in managing state affairs," clamoring that the Communist Party should give way to the democratic parties. He fabricated rumors that the Communist Party was cultivating two kinds of party spirit: "Everyone is a leader" and "Disrespecting non-party members." Chen Dingwai also slandered that the Communist Party "cannot lead science and technology" and advocated turning the Communist Party into a party of intellectuals.

	Liu Shouchang
	Praised Ge Peiqi without reservation
	The right-wing element Liu Shouchang is an engineer at the Beijing First Design Institute of the Ministry of Construction Engineering. This right-wing element, who came from a family of despotic landlords and actively defected to the Kuomintang regime before liberation, took advantage of the Communist Party's rectification campaign to launch a series of poisonous arrows at the Communist Party. He slandered that the Communist Party had become universally "corrupt" and said that "if the Communist Party does not turn back, the people will overthrow it." He praised without reservation the reactionary remarks of the right-wing element Ge Peiqi to "kill Communists," slandered Communist Party members as "secret agents," and called progressive people who were close to the Communist Party "slaves." He described individual shortcomings in work as "all crows are black."

	Dai Zhankui
	Claimed that the Communist Party is "the sinner of the nation"
	The right-wing element Dai Zhankui, exposed by the Design Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building, blatantly distorted history, reversed black and white, and slandered that "the Communist Party is not as good as the Kuomintang." He fabricated that "the Kuomintang governed the country with party principles, not with party rule. The Communist Party is everything is monopolized by Party members and did nothing good."
"Kuomintang members who broke the law were punished severely, while the Communist Party did not distinguish between Party law and state law. Party members who broke the law were at large and indulged in evil, harming the Party, the country, and the people." He slandered the Communist Party as "the sinner of the nation," saying that the Communist Party "destroyed China's old excellent traditions." He attacked the suppression of counter-revolutionaries as "arresting people to make up the numbers" and slandered the Party's policies as "vague principles," "the higher levels making samples, the middle levels copying samples, the lower levels distorting samples, and the lowest levels having no samples." Dai Zhankui scolded activists as "people who are good at flattering and fawning" and said that the election of advanced workers was "personally appointed by the emperor's brush." He even shamelessly insulted comrades who were close to the leadership as "putting white powder on their noses and pouring ecstasy soup upwards."
	Dai Zhankui usually said "old and weak" and made excuses for illnesses, always being passive and sluggish in his work. However, during the period of great blooming and contending, he suddenly became young, not only repeatedly publishing fallacies at the engineer's symposium, but also frequently extracting reactionary remarks from newspapers and filming big-character posters and cartoons in the organs that abused the Party, openly declaring that he planned to write a "unofficial history" of the Party.

	Liu Huandong
	Slandered that "the Party treats intellectuals as enemies"
	The right-wing element Liu Huandong, an engineer at the First Ministry of Machine Building, is the chairman of the Agricultural and Labor Democratic Party branch of the First Ministry of Machine Building and a member of the China Democratic League. He viciously compared the Communist Party to a "wolf" and the relationship between the Party and the masses to the relationship between a "spear" and a "shield," regretting that "today the masses did not fight back like a shield" against the Communist Party. He fabricated that "the Communist Party treats intellectuals as enemies." He slandered the people's democratic dictatorship as "violent rule" and "convincing people by force." He slandered the Communist Party for "telling people to learn materialism," while it itself "handles problems with idealism."

    工程技术界的群丑
    工程技术界资产阶级右派分子反共、反社会主义的丑恶言行，最近被中央各工业部的工作人员陆续揭发出来。这些右派分子趁共产党进行整风的机会，大肆攻击和污蔑共产党，妄图取消党对工程技术部门的领导。
     王光莹
    诬蔑“共产党变了质”
    冶金工业部有色金属工业管理局右派分子王光莹，诬蔑“共产党变了质”，少数党员剥削了六亿人民创造的价值。他诬蔑许多共产党员部长、局长、处长和科长都“不称职”，部长只是“签字、听汇报和分配任务”，“拿不出”办法，只起个“排版”的作用。而这个前年才走出校门的见习技术员王光莹，却认为自己“能当”局长了。
    王光莹把他这种反动言论看作是自己发现的“真理”。他妄想中国来个“匈牙利事件”，好来乘机“推共产党下台”。
    徐伐
    说思想改造“万万使不得”
    冶金工业部右派分子、技术员徐伐，诬蔑共产党员是“飞黄腾达的专家”，有“朕即国家”的帝王思想，并说今天“党和人民的矛盾是主要矛盾”。
    徐伐诬称共产党对知识分子的思想改造是“天下本无事，庸人自扰之”，“有百害而无一利”，其结果是“知识”变成了“罪恶”，党群关系受到破坏。因此，他呼吁思想改造“万万使不得”。
    徐伐还诽谤社会主义制度，说我国“愈建设愈穷”了，肃反运动
  “破坏了法纪”，他并且声称要组织政党，主张中国在经济上“走美国的道路”。
    王恩明
    说“党根本不能领导技术”
    披着中国玻璃“权威”外衣其实对整个玻璃工业特别是新品种新技术方面的知识很少的王恩明，原来是一个一贯反共、反社会主义的右派分子。他在建筑材料工业部公开诬蔑共产党员领导干部“只能在山沟里打游击，根本就不能领导技术”，共产党员干部的“知识低”，不能领导知识分子，说“革命干部了解农民”，是因为“农民没有什么知识”。他恶毒地诬蔑说，共产党叫知识分子“无法发言”，向人们灌输“上云下动的传令主义”，并说“没有一个工程师是自愿参加革命的”，他自己就发挥不了“作用”。
    王恩明还鼓吹美国资本主义的所谓“民主自由”。他说“美国什么都好”，甚至“连收发制度也比中国好”。他说“美国的黑人是天然受压迫的人，是白人的奴隶”。
    陈定外
    主张把党变成知识分子政党
    建筑工程部设计总局工程师陈定外，恶毒地诬蔑共产党“不学无术”，“既无才又无德”，并且说
  “管理国家大事民主党派不下于共产党”，叫嚷共产党应让位给民主党派。他造谣说共产党在培养两种党性：“个个是领导”和“轻视党外人士”。陈定外还诬蔑共产党“不能领导科学技术”，主张把共产党变成知识分子的政党。
    刘漱沧
    绝口称赞葛佩琦
    右派分子刘漱沧，是建筑工程部北京第一设计院的工程师。这个出身于恶霸地主家庭、在解放前积极投靠国民党政权的右派分子，利用共产党整风机会，向共产党放出了一连串的毒箭。他诬蔑共产党已经普遍“腐化”，说“共产党再不回头，人民就会把它打倒”。他绝口称赞右派分子葛佩琦要“杀共产党人”的反动言论，诽谤共产党员是“特务”，把接近共产党的进步人士叫作“奴才”。他把工作上的个别缺点说成“天下乌鸦一般黑”。
    戴占奎
    声称共产党是“民族的罪人”
    第一机械工业部设计总局揭露的右派分子戴占奎，明目张胆地歪曲历史，颠倒黑白，诬蔑“共产党不如国民党”，捏造什么“国民党以党义治国，不是以党治国，共产党是党员包办一切，没干好事”
  “国民党党员犯法，加倍处罚，共产党党法不分，党员犯法，逍遥法外，姑息养奸，害党，害国，害人民”。他诽谤共产党是“民族的罪人”，说什么共产党把“中国旧有的优良传统给毁弃了”。他攻击肃反运动是“捉人凑数”，诬蔑党的政策“是些笼统原则”，是“上级打样，中级抄样，下级走样，最下级就没有了样”。戴占奎谩骂积极分子是“善于奉承恭维，唯唯诺诺的人”，说选举先进工作者是“御笔亲点状元谱”，甚至无耻地辱骂接近领导的同志是“把鼻子抹上白粉、向上灌迷魂汤。”
    戴占奎平时口口声声说“年老体衰”，借口这病那病，一贯消极怠工；但在大鸣大放期间，忽然年青起来，不仅在工程师座谈会上一再发表谬论，而且还经常从报纸上摘录反动言论，并拍摄机关里谩骂党的大字报和漫画，公开宣称打算写什么党的“野史”。
    刘焕东
    诬蔑“党把知识分子当敌人”
    右派分子、第一机械工业部工程师刘焕东，是农工民主党第一机械工业部支部委员会主任委员、民盟盟员。他恶毒地把共产党比作
  “狼”，把党和群众的关系比作
  “矛”和“盾”的关系，婉惜“今天群众并未像盾一样反击”共产党。他捏造“共产党把知识分子当作敌人看待”。他诬蔑人民民主专政是“暴力统治”，是“以力服人”。他诽谤共产党“叫人家学唯物主义”，而自己“处理问题是唯心主义”。
