Eating Grain Must Be Planned

    Currently, many agricultural production cooperatives are展开 [launching] a major debate on the grain issue. The broad masses of cooperative members have recognized the major issues of right and wrong on the grain question, and their socialist consciousness has been rapidly enhanced. Those who previously blindly clamored for grain shortages are no longer clamoring. Everyone has spoken their minds and admitted that there is enough grain to eat; many households even admit to having surplus grain; only a very small number of farmers are truly short of food. This debate has promoted the summer grain purchase work and stimulated the production enthusiasm of cooperative members.

    Can we now say that as long as a major debate is conducted to clarify thinking, the problem of eating grain will be solved? We believe that this cannot be said. In order to solve the problem of eating grain, in addition to clarifying thinking, it is also necessary to organize farmers to save grain in a planned way.

    As the saying goes, "Eating doesn't impoverish, drinking doesn't impoverish, lack of calculation impoverishes a lifetime." This sentence illustrates how important planning is for a family's food and expenses. In the current situation where China's grain is not abundant, every family should especially use grain in a planned way. However, there are still many farmers who do not plan their grain consumption, and even seriously waste grain. After the wheat and early rice harvests this year, farmers in many areas began to be extravagant in their grain consumption. In Qu'gou, Anyang County, Henan, some farmers arranged their diets as follows: "Pancakes in the morning, noodles at noon, steamed buns and fried eggs in the evening." After eating, they shouted that they were short of grain and reached out to the cooperative and the state for it. The Dawu Agricultural Cooperative in Xindeng County, Zhejiang Province, has 72 members, with an average of more than ten chickens per household, almost all fed with rice. Previously, many members ate potatoes and old pumpkins as supplements, but now they no longer do so. They say, "Chickens don't eat grass in August, and wives don't eat porridge in August. With the bumper harvest of early rice, people eat rice, and chickens also enjoy themselves." The phenomenon of brewing wine and boiling sugar is quite common in the southern provinces. The phenomenon of extravagant banquets and waste of grain due to weddings and funerals is also not uncommon. The result of such arbitrary waste of grain is that farmers who were originally able to eat enough or have a surplus have also become grain-deficient households. After the crops are harvested, according to rural customs, it is originally excusable to eat some good food. But excessive waste is not appropriate.

    Many people use more grain without a care because they believe that after collectivization, they should eat more and better. Coupled with the relatively lax grain unified sales work in rural areas, this has led some people to have the misconception that "the state has unlimited grain." Some cooperative members openly say, "Production listens to the gong, eating is the responsibility of the cooperative director, and if there are no grain coupons, look for the township head." For this phenomenon, on the one hand, it is necessary to carry out extensive and in-depth publicity and education, so that everyone understands the overall grain situation in our country, understands the great significance of saving grain for building socialism, and thus consciously makes careful calculations and saves grain in all aspects. On the other hand, the grain supply system must be further tightened. In the future, the state and agricultural cooperatives will not provide extra supplies to those who are short of grain due to wasting grain.

    On a national scale, because the historical levels of grain consumption vary from region to region, the current standards for retaining grain are also different. Some regions retain more, and some regions retain less. However, as long as one is diligent and thrifty in managing the household and makes careful calculations, even regions with less retained grain can live well. Conversely, if one cannot be diligent and thrifty in managing the household and make careful calculations, even regions with more retained grain may not have enough to eat. The grain consumption of Zhang Lao Zhen's family in the Xigangtou Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Shijiazhuang is a good example. His family has twenty-one people. Last winter and this spring, the state supplied his family with 400 jin of grain per month, and the whole family could not eat more than 13 jin of grain per day, an average of only ten liang per person. But they did not think this was an insurmountable difficulty. The whole family held a meeting to make a plan, deciding to eat more yams and white radish slices and other substitutes to save grain. Regarding how to eat the 13 jin of grain, after discussion by the whole family, it was decided that in the winter, when farm work was not too busy, they would only eat ten jin of noodle pancakes and drink radish slice soup in the morning and at noon every day. In the evening, when they did not go to the fields, they would steam more than twenty jin of yams for everyone to eat, and cook two or three jin of cornmeal and vegetable rice with yams and radish slices. Those who did heavy work during the day would save a few pancakes from the morning and noon according to the plan to give them for dinner. It was also stipulated that children should not be given snacks, and chickens and dogs should not be fed leftovers. In this way, the whole family not only did not feel that life was hard throughout the spring, but also bought 36 jin less grain from the state. After the wheat harvest this year, his family distributed more than 1,900 jin of wheat according to consumption standards. At this time, everyone made a grain consumption plan again, stipulating that in addition to eating 20 to 22 jin of noodles every day, they would also mix in steamed pumpkins and large stuffed buns. Noodles and pancakes were more expensive, so it was decided not to eat them. The remaining regulations regarding children's snacks and chicken and dog feeding remained the same. In this way, everyone could eat their fill, eat well, and not waste grain.

    Saving grain must be done frequently and little by little. We hope that everyone can be as careful as Zhang Lao Zhen's family, make careful calculations, formulate grain consumption plans, be diligent and thrifty in managing the household, save grain, and live a good life. Housewives are in charge of household affairs. They cook, feed pigs, and feed chickens and ducks. The inflow and outflow of grain must pass through their hands, so they have a particularly important responsibility in saving grain. If they manage it well, grain can be greatly saved. If every person in the country saves an average of half an ounce of grain per day, it can save the country more than 6 billion jin of grain per year. We hope that rural cadres and women's federations in various places will extensively mobilize and organize women to save grain in every possible way, and pay attention to summarizing experience and promoting it.

    Some people say: The amount of grain is fixed, and it is enough to eat according to the fixed amount. Why should we advocate saving again? This statement is incorrect. In fact, although the amount of grain is fixed, some people do not really strictly eat according to the fixed amount. The fact that many families eat more than the fixed amount and then ask the government for supplies is clear evidence. Hubei Province had a bumper harvest last year, and the amount retained was also relatively high; however, because farmers consumed too much grain at will after the autumn harvest, the state had to supplement more than 50 million jin of grain during this spring's unified sales census to supply farmers who were short of grain due to excessive grain consumption. If we actively advocate and organize everyone to save grain, this phenomenon can be avoided. If we do not advocate or organize, these grains that can be saved cannot be saved. Zhang Lao Zhen's family bought 36 jin less grain from the state this spring under such tight conditions. If it were not for the advocacy of the above and their own conscious careful calculations, it would have been absolutely impossible. It can be seen that there is a big difference between advocating and not advocating. Thinking that stipulating the fixed amount is the same as doing everything well, and no longer needing detailed organizational work, and thus letting things take their course, is absolutely incorrect.

    We should ensure that every person and every household has a plan for grain consumption and pay attention to saving at all times. Everyone must understand that saving grain can sell more surplus grain to the state, or buy less grain from the state, which is a support for the country's construction. Moreover, if some areas encounter disasters, the grain supply may be reduced. At that time, if you have some savings on weekdays, it will reduce some difficulties. If you eat everything up on weekdays, the difficulties will naturally be greater. This principle is very clear.

### 吃粮要有计划

    吃粮要有计划
    目前有许多农业生产合作社正在展开关于粮食问题的大辩论，广大社员群众认清了粮食问题上的大是大非，社会主义觉悟迅速提高。以前盲目吵闹缺粮的，现在不吵了。大家都说出了心里话，承认粮食够吃；不少的户还承认有余粮；真正不够吃的只是极少数农户。这个辩论推动了夏粮征购工作，并且激发了社员的生产积极性。
    现在是不是可以说，只要经过一场大辩论，打通思想，吃粮问题就解决了呢？我们认为还不能这样说。为了解决吃粮问题，除了打通思想以外，还要组织农户有计划地节约用粮。
    俗话说：“吃不穷，喝不穷，算计不到一世穷。”这句话说明了一个家庭在吃用上的计划性是多么重要。在目前我国粮食不够充裕的总情况下，每个家庭尤其应该有计划地用粮。但是，现在还有很多农户用粮没有计划，甚至严重地浪费着粮食。今年小麦和早稻收获以后，不少地区的农户在用粮方面便大手大脚起来。河南安阳县曲沟一带有些农民给自己安排的食谱是：“清早饼，中午面，晚上蒸馍煎鸡蛋。”吃完了就叫喊缺粮，伸手向社要，向国家要。浙江新登县大坞农业社有七十二户社员，平均每户养十多只鸡，几乎全部用稻谷喂养。以前有很多社员搭配着吃洋芋、老南瓜等，现在也不搭配了。他们说：“八月的鸡不吃草，八月的婆娘不吃粥。早稻大丰收，人吃大米饭，鸡儿也享福。”煮酒熬糖的现象在南方各省相当普遍。因婚丧喜庆大摆筵席、浪费粮食的现象，也不少见。这样随意浪费粮食的结果，使本来够吃或者有余的农户也变成了缺粮户。在庄稼收获以后，按照农村的习惯，吃一些好的，这原是无可厚非的事。但是过分地浪费，那就是不应该的了。
    许多人所以满不在乎地多用粮食，是由于他们认为合作化了，就应该吃得多一些、好一些。加上农村粮食统销工作偏松，这就使得一部分人发生“国家粮食无限多”的错觉。有的社员公开说：“生产听锣响，吃饭有社长，没有粮票找乡长”。对于这种现象，一方面是要进行广泛深入的宣传教育，使大家明白我们国家的粮食总情况，懂得节约用粮对于建设社会主义的重大意义，因而自觉地从各方面精打细算，节省粮食。另一方面是要把粮食供应制度进一步严格起来。今后凡是因为浪费粮食而造成缺粮的，国家和农业社都不额外供应。
    就全国范围说，因为各个地区历史上粮食消费水平不同，所以现在留粮标准也不一样。有的地区留得多些，有的地区留得少些。但是，只要勤俭持家，精打细算，就是留粮较少的地区，生活也会过得下去。反之，如果不能勤俭持家，精打细算，就是留粮多的地区也未必够吃。石家庄市郊西岗头农业社张老振家的用粮情况就是个很好的例子。他全家二十一口人。去冬今春，国家每月供应他家四百斤粮食，全家每天吃粮食不能超过十三斤，一个人平均不过十两。但他们并没有认为这是了不得的困难。他们全家开会做计划，决定多吃一些山药和白萝卜片等代食品来节约粮食。关于十三斤粮食的吃法，经过全家商量，决定在冬季农活不太忙的时候，每天早晨和中午只吃十斤面的饼子，喝萝卜片菜汤。晚间不下地，就蒸上二十多斤山药大家吃，再煮上二、三斤玉米面和山药、萝卜片放在一起的菜饭。白天干重活的，由早晨和中午按计划剩下几个饼子来给他们晚间吃。另外还规定孩子不给零吃干粮，鸡狗不给喂剩饭。这样，全家一春天不仅没有感到生活苦，还少买了国家三十六斤粮食。今年麦收以后，他全家按消费标准分了一千九百多斤小麦，这时大家又做了吃粮计划，规定每天除吃二十斤到二十二斤面以外，还要掺着吃蒸北瓜、大馅包子。捞面条和烙饼比较费面，决定不吃。其余关于小孩零食和鸡狗喂养，仍坚持旧的规定。这样，大家都能吃得饱，吃得好，也没有浪费粮食。
    节约粮食，必须经常地、一点一滴地去做。我们希望大家都能像张老振家那样，精打细算，订出用粮计划，勤俭持家，节约粮食，并且把生活过得很好。家庭主妇是主管家务的人，她们要做饭，喂猪，喂鸡鸭。粮食的进出都要经过她们的手，因此她们在节约粮食方面就负有特别重要的责任。她们掌握得好，粮食就大可节约。假如全国每人每天平均节约半两粮食，加到一起，每年就可以为国家节约六十多亿斤粮食。我们希望各地农村干部和妇联组织广泛地发动和组织妇女，千方百计地节约粮食，并且注意总结经验，加以推广。
    有一些人说：粮食是有定量的，按定量吃就完了，何必再提倡节约？这种说法是不对的。事实上，粮食虽然有定量，但有一些人并不真正严格按定量吃。有许多人家吃的超过定量，又向政府要求供应，就是明证。湖北省去年丰收，留量也较高；但因秋收以后农民过多地随意消费口粮，在今春统销普查期间，国家不得不增补了五千多万斤粮食，供应因多用了粮食而缺粮的农户。如果积极地提倡并组织大家节约粮食，这现象就是可以避免的。如果不提倡，不组织，这些能够节余的粮食就节余不出来了。张老振家今春在那样不宽裕的条件下，还少买了国家三十六斤粮食，如果不是上面提倡和自己有意识地精打细算，那就绝对办不到。可见提倡和不提倡是大有分别的。以为规定了定量就算做好了一切，不再需要细致的组织工作，因而放任自流，那是绝对不正确的。
    我们应该做到每人每户用粮都有计划，时刻注意节约。要使每个人都懂得：节约了粮食，就可以多卖余粮给国家，或少向国家购买粮食，这对国家的建设是一种支援。而且，如果有的地区遇到了灾荒，粮食的供应还有可能减少。那时候，如果自己平日有所积蓄，就会减少一些困难。如果平时吃得精光，困难当然就多一些。这种道理是非常明白的。
