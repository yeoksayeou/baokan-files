Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 27th: Reporter Shi Yue'e reports: 100,000 workers in Wuxi City have received preliminary socialist education. Now this education movement is being carried out in depth in grassroots units such as industry, transportation, post and telecommunications, and commerce.

Wuxi City's socialist education movement for employees is mainly focused on criticizing right-wing fallacies. The main methods of education are giving reports and holding political classes. Textile factories and silk reeling factories, considering the relatively low theoretical level of the workers, first introduced some right-wing remarks and actions directly related to the workers, and then repeatedly carried out education through forums, debates, comic dialogues, and living newspapers to clarify the fundamental issues of the struggle between the socialist and capitalist lines.

In this education movement, old workers are the best "political instructors." According to surveys in relevant factories, some young workers, because they have not suffered in the old society and have individualistic ideas, are easily confused by the remarks of right-wing elements. Old workers suffered cruel oppression and exploitation in the old society and are acutely aware of the reactionary nature of right-wing remarks, so they can refute right-wing fallacies with their own experiences. Some young workers in the Meifeng Silk Factory originally had unclear understanding of the right-wing elements' fallacies such as "the unified purchase and sales system has messed things up" and "many places are not free." Some were influenced and complained about planned supply and refused to obey work assignments. After the launch of the socialist education, the leadership organized eight old workers, including Li Pandi and Bao Jinmei, to report to all workers based on their personal experiences. They recalled and compared their daily life, labor production, labor insurance, welfare, and the status of workers and women, refuting the fallacies of the right-wing elements. Their speeches deeply moved the young workers. Some young workers said to the veteran workers: "After listening to your speeches, we realized that today is heaven and the past was hell. We must draw a clear line with the right-wing elements." Through these educations, many employees have begun to understand right and wrong and have raised their awareness. At mass debate meetings in factories such as Shenxin and Qingfeng, workers stated their positions, saying: "Right-wing elements oppose the leadership of the Communist Party and oppose socialism. We will never agree. We will defend the leadership of the Party and defend socialism even with our lives." Many workers have improved their understanding theoretically and practically, expressing that they will further strengthen the worker-peasant alliance. Some workers have also remitted their savings back to the countryside to invest in cooperatives. At present, some enterprises and institutions have begun to educate workers on the relationship between the individual and the collective, democracy and centralism, and freedom and discipline in light of the specific circumstances of their units. The Qingfeng Textile Factory has given seven classes to its employees and organized discussions.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 26th: The Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions has launched a large-scale socialist education campaign among workers throughout the city. More than 1,000 amateur lecturers from various factories and enterprises have adopted flexible and diverse forms such as "lecturing while following shifts," "giving lectures in construction sites and workshops," and "giving lectures in canteens and clubs" to widely explain the great significance of the anti-bourgeois rightist struggle to workers. From late July to mid-August, they have given more than 600 lectures in more than 200 factories and enterprises, with more than 100,000 workers attending the lectures.

Before the launch of this lecture campaign, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions concentrated its efforts on compiling a lecture script entitled "Unite and Resolutely Struggle Against the Anti-Communist and Anti-Socialist Rightists." In order to suit the characteristics of amateur lectures, the lecture script was divided into ten topics, systematically explaining the significance of the rectification movement, the situation and significance of the anti-bourgeois rightist struggle, etc. In particular, it systematically exposed and refuted the anti-Communist and anti-socialist fallacies of the bourgeois rightists. At present, amateur lecturers throughout the city continue to carry out lecture activities among workers throughout the city.

### 大规模开展社会主义教育运动　无锡老工人当政治教员　天津千余讲演员深入车间

    大规模开展社会主义教育运动
　　无锡老工人当政治教员　天津千余讲演员深入车间
    本报南京27日电　记者史月娥报道：无锡市十万工人已受到初步的社会主义教育。现在这个教育运动正在工业、交通、邮电、商业等基层单位深入开展。
    无锡市对职工进行社会主义教育运动，是以批判右派谬论为主要内容的。教育的主要方式是作报告和上政治课。纺织厂、缫丝厂根据工人理论水平较低的情况，先把一些跟工人有直接关系的右派言行给工人介绍，然后通过座谈会、辩论会、相声、活报等方法反复进行教育，使大家搞清社会主义路线与资本主义路线斗争的根本问题。
  在这次教育运动中，老工人是最好的“政治教员”。据有关工厂调查，有些青年工人，由于没有在旧社会吃过苦头，又有着个人主义思想，容易被右派分子的言论所迷惑。老年工人在旧社会受过残酷的压迫和剥削，对右派言论的反动性感觉敏锐，所以能以亲身经历，驳斥右派谬论。美丰丝厂有些青工原来对右派分子的“统购统销搞糟了”，“许多地方不自由”等谬论认识不清，有人受了影响埋怨计划供应，不服从工作调配。开展社会主义教育后，领导上便组织了李盘娣、包金妹等八个老工人以亲身体会向全体工人做报告。她们从日常生活、劳动生产、劳保福利和工人、妇女的地位等方面回忆对比，驳斥了右派分子的谬论。他们的发言使青工们深受感动。有些青年工人对老师傅们说：“听了你们的发言，才体会到今天是天堂，过去是地狱，一定跟右派划清界限”。通过这些教育，很多职工已开始弄清了大是大非，提高了觉悟程度。在申新、庆丰等厂的群众性辩论会上，工人都表明立场说：“右派分子反对共产党的领导，反对社会主义，我们决不答应，拼了性命也要保卫党的领导，保卫社会主义”。许多工人从理论和实际上提高了认识，表示一定进一步加强工农联盟，有些工人还把积余的钱寄回农村，投资给合作社。目前，有些企业单位已开始结合本单位的具体情况，对工人进行个人与集体、民主与集中、自由与纪律的教育。庆丰纺织厂已向职工上了七课，并组织了讨论。
    新华社天津26日电　天津市工会联合会在全市职工中展开大规模的社会主义教育活动。各工厂企业的一千多名业余讲演员，采取“跟班讲”、“到工地车间讲演”、“到食堂俱乐部讲演”等灵活多样的形式，广泛地向职工讲解反资产阶级右派斗争的伟大意义。从7月下旬到8月中旬，他们已经在二百多个工厂企业中讲演了六百多次，听讲的职工达十万多人次。
    市工会联合会在这次讲演活动展开以前，就集中力量编写了“团结起来坚决向反共反社会主义的右派分子进行斗争”的讲演稿。为了适合业余讲演的特点，讲稿分作十个专题，系统地说明整风运动的意义，反资产阶级右派斗争的形势和意义等；对于资产阶级右派分子的反共反社会主义的谬论特别作了系统的揭发和驳斥。目前全市业余讲演员们还继续在全市职工中展开讲演活动。
