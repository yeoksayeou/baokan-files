Xinhua News Agency, August 27th. Xinhua News Agency reporters Zhang Xinchen and Bu Zhaowen report: Currently, some democratic parties' organizations in Beijing have actively participated in the anti-Rightist struggle, but the organizations of some other democratic parties have been slow to act, which deserves attention.

The Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League and most of its grassroots organizations have actively struggled against the Zhang-Luo Alliance and its rightist core members distributed in the Beijing Municipal organization of the China Democratic League since the launch of the anti-Rightist struggle. Recently, in order to further strengthen the leadership of the anti-Rightist struggle, the number of members in the municipal leading group has increased from the original seven to twenty-three, and many activists in the anti-Rightist struggle from grassroots organizations have been absorbed to participate. Among the one hundred and twelve grassroots organizations of the China Democratic League, ninety have established or are in the process of establishing anti-Rightist struggle leading groups. Most of the grassroots organizations of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang in Beijing have also established rectification leading groups, and the anti-Rightist struggle is gradually deepening. Currently, a resolute struggle is being waged against the rightist core members Tan Tiwu and Xu Baokui.

However, the leading members of the Beijing organizations of the China Association for Promoting Democracy and the Jiusan Society have not yet actively led the anti-Rightist struggle. According to the revealed materials, the problems in these two organizations are quite serious. Among the ninety-three grassroots organizations of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, rightists have been found in forty-eight grassroots organizations, including members of the municipal committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy and heads of grassroots organizations. The vast majority of rightists exposed in Beijing's middle schools are members of the China Association for Promoting Democracy. However, until now, the Beijing leading group of the China Association for Promoting Democracy has not actively led the anti-Rightist struggle. Lei Jieqiong, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, stated at the Second Session of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Congress that she would actively lead the anti-Rightist struggle in the future, but it has been more than three weeks since the Second Session of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress closed, and the anti-Rightist struggle of the Beijing organization of the China Association for Promoting Democracy has not made any progress. The leading members of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Jiusan Society, such as Xue Yu (Chairman), Lou Bangyan (Secretary-General), and Gu Zhizhong (Director of the Propaganda Department), are all rightist core members. Rightists have been found in thirty-six of the fifty-three grassroots organizations, and twelve grassroots organizations are in a state of paralysis. The Beijing organization of the Jiusan Society has removed the rightists from the anti-Rightist leading group, but because the existing leading group members are dominated by right-leaning sentiments, the anti-Rightist struggle is still not being carried out forcefully.

The members of the grassroots organizations of these two democratic parties and some grassroots organizations have actively participated in the anti-Rightist struggle like all the people of Beijing. Now they are demanding that the municipal-level leading bodies of these two democratic parties quickly change their positions and actively lead the anti-Rightist struggle.

Among all the democratic parties' organizations in Beijing, the problem of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party is the most serious. The Beijing organization of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party has long been under the control of rightists Zhang Bojun, Li Boqiu, and Li Jiansheng. In the second half of last year, it unscrupulously expanded its organization, resulting in a complex organizational composition. During the period of "great blooming and contending," the municipal level and most grassroots organizations became bases for rightists to attack the Communist Party and socialism. Because some members of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party have been deeply poisoned, many organizations are in a state of paralysis and have lost their fighting power. Now, with the gradual development of the anti-Rightist struggle throughout the city, some members of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party have gradually taken action and are uniting around the newly established municipal-level leading group to begin struggling against the rightists.

Currently, people are watching the movements of some democratic party leaders who have abandoned the socialist road or have a tendency to deviate from the socialist road.

### 各民主党派北京市组织反右派斗争进度悬殊  农工民进九三亟需迎头赶上

    各民主党派北京市组织反右派斗争进度悬殊
    农工民进九三亟需迎头赶上
    新华社27日讯　新华社记者张新辰、卜昭文报道：目前北京市的一些民主党派组织已积极参加到反右派斗争的行列里来，但是还有一些民主党派的组织迟迟未动，值得引起人们的注意。
    民盟北京市委员会及其大部分基层组织，从反右派斗争开展以来，就积极向章罗联盟及其分布在民盟北京市组织里的右派骨干分子进行斗争。最近为了进一步加强反右派斗争的领导，市的领导小组的人数由原来的七人增加到二十三人，并吸收了许多基层组织中反右派斗争的积极分子参加。在一百十二个民盟基层组织中，已成立和正在成立反右派斗争领导小组的有九十个。民革北京市的基层组织中也大部分建立了整风领导小组，反右派斗争也逐渐深入，现在正在对右派骨干分子谭惕吾、许宝骙进行坚决的斗争。
    但是民主促进会和九三学社的北京市组织领导成员至今还没有积极领导反右派斗争。根据揭露出的材料来看，这两个组织中的问题相当严重。民主促进会九十三个基层组织中，已经发现有四十八个基层组织有右派分子，其中有民进市委委员和基层组织的负责人。在北京市的中学中被揭露的右派分子，绝大部分是民进成员。但是直到现在，民进北京市领导小组还没有积极领导反右派斗争。民进北京市委主任委员雷洁琼曾在北京市第二届人民代表大会第二次会议上表示今后要积极领导反右派斗争，但是市人民代表大会第二次会议闭幕到现在已经有三个多星期，民进北京市组织的反右派斗争还没有什么动静。九三学社北京市委主任委员薛愚、秘书长楼邦彦、宣传部长顾执中等领导人员都是右派骨干分子，在五十三个基层组织中有三十六个基层组织已发现有右派分子，还有十二个基层组织陷于瘫痪状态。九三学社北京市组织已将右派分子从反右派领导小组里清除出去，但是由于现有领导小组人员中右倾情绪占优势，反右派斗争仍开展得没有力量。
    这两个民主党派基层组织的成员和一些基层组织，和全北京市人民一样积极参加了反右派斗争，现在他们要求这两个民主党派市一级领导机构，迅速改变立场，积极领导反右派斗争。
    在所有北京市民主党派组织中，农工民主党的问题最为严重。农工民主党北京市组织由于长期在右派分子章伯钧、李伯球、李健生的控制之下，去年下半年又不择手段地大肆发展组织，因此组织成分复杂。在大鸣大放期间市一级和多数基层组织都成了右派分子向共产党向社会主义进攻的基地。由于农工民主党的一些成员受毒较深，因此许多组织呈现瘫痪状态，失去了战斗力。现在随着全市反右派斗争的逐渐开展，农工民主党的部分成员已逐渐积极行动起来，他们团结在新成立的市一级领导小组周围，开始向右派分子进行斗争。
    目前，人们正在注视背弃社会主义道路或有脱离社会主义道路倾向的一些民主党派领导人的动态。
