　　After a rain in autumn, the scenery around the Bayan Obo iron mine has become even more enchanting. The grassland surrounding the iron mountain is boundless and green, and the autumn wind blowing from the Mongolian plateau is cool and pleasant. The future iron ore supply base of Baotou Steel is under intense construction during this good construction season.
　　In this iron mining area, known as "Treasure Mountain" by the local Mongolian herders, outcrops of black and brownish-grey ore are everywhere. Now, construction workers can be seen everywhere in the mining area. Of the nearly five thousand people living here, about four thousand are employees responsible for the basic construction tasks of the mining area. Measuring team members' little red flags and construction stakes are scattered all over; heavy-duty trucks shuttle along the roads. The entire mining area is filled with a scene of construction.
　　The construction project is concentrated in the main mining area, which has imposing mountains. Here, a batch of temporary projects serving the mining of ore has been completed, including an air compressor station, high-voltage power transmission lines, compressed air pipelines, and mechanical repair facilities. Hundreds of workers are using the installed equipment to mine ore on the top of the main mining area, braving the wind, for use in the extensive ore industrial testing work.
　　Now, the number of workers coming to this mining area from Anshan, Benxi, Baotou, and other places is increasing day by day, and large quantities of building materials and construction machinery are being transported to the construction site. The construction of railway, crushing, and industrial site systems in this mining area is about to begin. The construction of railway, crushing, and industrial site systems, which will begin this year, are the main projects of the mining area. During the construction process, a large area of undulating hills will have to be leveled to build factories and railways, making the project extremely arduous. In order to meet the power needs of the project, a temporary power station with ten times the power generation capacity of the original power station in the mining area was put into production in June, and a new power station began construction in early August.
　　Located at an altitude of more than 1,600 meters, the Bayan Obo iron mining area is very short of water. In the past, how to meet the large amount of engineering water required was a common concern for the builders of the mining area. On the eve of large-scale construction in the mining area, the water problem has been solved. After more than ten months of intense labor by hundreds of workers, a water pipeline winding across the grassland has been built and water was supplied on August 1. This water pipe is more than fifty *li* long, and the water source was found with the help of local herders. Its name is Bayan Bulag (Rich Spring). Now, the abundant underground water source is being continuously drawn to the various construction sites under construction.
　　After the water problem was solved, the construction project of the future mining city – the urban area of Bayan Obo – also started universally. People coming to the mining area from Baotou first see a dense array of scaffolding, with new buildings such as municipal government offices, the mining area expert guest house, clubs, staff dormitories, and banks and department stores under construction. The large water pipes for the water supply and drainage system and the urban power transmission lines are extending from the place where the survey team pitched their tents in the past to the southwest where the railway station is located. By the end of this year, Bayan Obo will initially take shape as a city. (Attached picture)

　　白云鄂博的秋天
　　新华社记者　王文亮
    一场秋雨以后，白云鄂博铁矿山周围的景色变得更加迷人了。铁山周围的草原，碧绿无垠，从蒙古高原上吹来的阵阵秋风，凉爽宜人。未来的包钢铁矿石供应基地，正在这个施工的好季节里，紧张建设。
    这个被当地蒙古族牧民称为“宝山”的铁矿区，乌黑的和褐灰色的矿石露头，到处都是。现在，矿区到处都可以看到建设的人群。居住在这里的近五千人口，担负矿区基本建设任务的职工就占了四千名左右。测量队员们手插的小红旗和施工标桩，星罗棋布；载重汽车在公路上穿梭而行。整个矿区充满了一片建设的情景。
    建设工程集中在山势巍峨的主矿区。在这里，一批为开采矿石服务的临时工程已经完工了，其中有空气压缩机站、高压输电线、压缩空气管道、机械修理设施等项目。几百名工人正在利用已经安装起来的设备，在主矿区的山顶上迎风开采矿石，供浩繁的矿石工业试验工作使用。
    现在，从鞍山、本溪、包头等地来到这个矿区的工人日益增多，大批建筑材料和施工机械源源运到工地。这个矿区的铁路、破碎、工业场地等系统的建设工程即将开始施工。今年开始的铁路、破碎、工业场地等系统的建设，都是矿区的主体工程。建设过程中，要把一大片起伏不平的丘陵削平，在上面修建厂房，建造铁路，工程异常艰巨。为了满足工程上的用电需要，一座比矿区原有发电所发电能力大十倍的临时发电站，刚刚在6月份投入生产，8月上旬又有一座新的发电站开始施工。
    地处海拔一千六百多公尺的白云鄂博铁矿区，非常缺乏水。在过去的日子里，如何满足大量需要的工程用水，曾成为矿区建设者普遍焦虑的一个问题。在矿区大规模施工前夕，水的问题已经解决了。经过几百名工人十个多月的紧张劳动，一条蜿蜒在草原上的输水管线已经建成，并且在8月1日通了水。这条水管长达五十多华里，水源地是当地牧民帮助找到的。它的名字叫白云布拉格（富泉）。现在，充沛的地下水源，正被源源不断地引到正在施工的各个工地上去。
    水的问题解决以后，未来的矿工城——白云鄂博的市区建设工程也普遍开工了。从包头来到矿区的人们，一下汽车，首先看到的就是一片密密麻麻的脚手架，市政机关办公室、矿区专家招待所、俱乐部、职工宿舍和银行、百货公司等今年的新建筑，都在进行施工。上下水道粗大的水管，市区输电线路，正从过去勘察队员搭过帐篷的地方，向火车站所在的西南方向伸延。今年年底，白云鄂博将初步形成城市的雏形。（附图片）
