Annihilate the "Icebreaker"
	"Icebreaker" is the name of a right-wing small clique at the Beijing Russian Language Institute. Le Jinmin and Gu Benkun are the core members of the "Icebreaker."

	The "Icebreaker's" frantic attacks on the Party committee and the school were by no means accidental. The answer can be found in the consistent words and deeds of the "Icebreaker's" core members, Le Jinmin and Gu Benkun. Le Jinmin's father was a Kuomintang secret agent who was arrested during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. She has always hated the Party. Gu Benkun's family were landlords.

	When the rectification campaign began, Le Jinmin thought the time had come and was secretly delighted. She gathered rightists such as Gu Benkun, Tian Qun, and Qiu Guanghua to create the "Icebreaker" wall poster, spreading reactionary remarks, and insulting the Party committee and Party members as "gods of death," "lecherous villains," and "aristocrats." They slandered the Party committee as "incompetent mediocrities." They slandered activists as "braggarts, flatterers, shameless people," and "lackeys." They also defamed the Russian Language Institute as a "monastery" and a "shabby training class," completely negating the school's achievements, attacking the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and inciting those who were struggled against in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries to "seek redress." They also united various reactionary big-character posters in the school to expand the influence of the rightists. Le Jinmin spread rumors that "the Department of Oriental Languages at Peking University had a successful strike" and "Tsinghua University sent a telegram to universities across the country," using this to incite students to take action to solve their major problems. She said that Hu Feng was not a counter-revolutionary and that the government had arrested the wrong person. Gu Benkun disseminated Lin Xiling's reactionary remarks, saying "Lin Xiling is a young and brave girl."

	The "Icebreaker" small clique colluded with Wu Qingyang, a rightist among the teachers. Wu Qingyang gave the trade union's loudspeaker to the "Icebreaker" small clique, making the small clique attack the Party committee and the school even more frantically. At the same time, Le Jinmin attended teacher meetings, introduced the students' "petition" situation to the teachers, and called on the teachers to support their strike action.

	After the anti-rightist struggle began, the "Icebreaker" was countered from all sides. Hu Ziping, an assistant teacher in the Marxist-Leninist foundation group, said, what kind of goods is the "Icebreaker" carrying? The words they used to attack and slander the Party can only be seen in the reactionary newspapers in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the United States. Ding Shichao, a student in the advanced studies class, said that the "Icebreaker" is carrying explosives and must not be allowed to sail in the people's ocean. Lin Yinmin and Wang Guangsun, the editors of "Icebreaker," have now woken up. Lin Yinmin revealed that Le Jinmin harbored deep hatred for the Party in her heart, and she wanted to "avenge" her reactionary father. As soon as the rectification campaign began, she shot countless poisonous arrows at the Party committee and school leaders.

	Now, this "Icebreaker" has been completely crushed.

    歼击“破冰船”
    彭利钊
    “破冰船”是北京俄语学院的右派小集团的名字。乐进敏和古本锟是“破冰船”的骨干分子。
    “破冰船”向党委和学校疯狂进攻，绝不是偶然的。从“破冰船”骨干分子乐进敏和古本锟的一贯言行中，就可以找到答案。乐进敏的父亲是个军统特务，在肃反运动中被捕。她一贯仇恨党。古本锟家庭是地主。
    整风开始了，乐进敏认为时机到了，暗暗高兴。她就纠合古本锟、田群和丘光华等右派分子创办“破冰船”墙报，散布反动言论，辱骂党委和党员是“死神”、“淫棍恶徒”、“贵族”。污蔑党委都是“不学无术的庸人”。污蔑积极分子是“吹牛拍马，无耻之徒”、“狗腿子”。他们还诽谤俄语学院是“修道院”、“破破烂烂的训练班”，全盘否定学校工作成绩，攻击肃反运动，煽动肃反被斗对象起来“申冤雪辱”。他们还联合学校各种反动大字报，以扩大右派影响。乐进敏造谣说“北大东语系罢课胜利”，“清华向全国高等学校发出通电”，借此煽动同学行动起来，解决专业问题。她说胡风不是反革命，政府捕错了。古本锟散布林希翎的反动言论，说“林希翎是个年轻勇敢的姑娘”。
    “破冰船”小集团同教师中的右派分子吴青阳勾结起来。吴青阳把工会的扩音器交给“破冰船”小集团，使这个小集团更加疯狂地向党委和学校进攻，同时乐进敏参加教师会议，向教师们介绍学生“请愿”情况，呼吁教师支持他们罢课的行动。
    反右派斗争开始后，“破冰船”受到各方面的反击。马列主义基础组助教胡子平说，“破冰船”载的是什么货色？他们攻击污蔑党的字眼只有在台湾、香港和美国的反动报纸上才能看得到。进修班同学丁士超说，“破冰船”载的是炸药，绝不能让它在人民的海洋里航行。“破冰船”的编辑林荫民、王广荪等人，现在清醒过来了。林荫民揭发说，乐进敏内心深处对党怀着很深的仇恨，她要为反动的父亲“雪恨”。整风一开始，她就向党委和学校领导射出无数支毒箭。
    现在，这艘“破冰船”已被彻底击垮了。
