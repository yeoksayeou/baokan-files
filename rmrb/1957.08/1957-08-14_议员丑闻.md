    Senator Scandal

    According to a recent report in the American magazine "The Reporter," several months ago, Texas State Representative James Kirksey prepared to introduce a bill to prohibit doctors practicing "naturopathy" from opening businesses in Texas. The chairman of the "Naturopathic Physicians Association," Harman, invited Kirksey to a conversation at the hotel where Harman was staying. Harman recorded the conversation using a concealed recorder.

    Harman requested Kirksey to withdraw his proposal and instead support a proposal favorable to "naturopathy," and promised remuneration. The following is a transcript of their conversation.

    Kirksey: Well, you said that if we are willing to do it, you are willing to reward my services. Okay, let's sit down and talk frankly.

    Harman: Okay.

    Kirksey: How much are you prepared to pay?

    Harman: What do you think it's worth?

    Kirksey: I don't know. You're a bit more knowledgeable than me…

    Kirksey: Three thousand five hundred dollars is too little. I think five thousand dollars is more like it.

    Because it was a recording, this conversation could not be denied. But in reality, senators taking bribes is an open secret in the United States. Below are some examples also presented in the same issue of "The Reporter." Former State Senator Sherman received a special fee of three thousand dollars from "American Trust Guarantee Company" when he was a member of the Congressional Insurance Committee. Former State Senator Strauss also received a bribe of three thousand six hundred dollars from the same company. Current State Senator Asrey received a bribe of ten thousand dollars from the former manager of the bankrupt "American Trust Guarantee Company." Another current State Senator, Parkhouse, accepted five hundred shares of "Labor Lee Life Insurance Company."

    议员丑闻
    据最近一期美国“展望”杂志的报道，数月以前得克萨斯州州众议员詹姆斯·柯克斯准备提出一项法案，禁止实行“自然疗法”的医生在得克萨斯州开业。“自然疗法医师协会”的主席哈尔曼邀请了柯克斯到哈尔曼所住的旅馆举行谈话。哈尔曼用暗装的录音器把谈话录了下来。
    哈尔曼请求柯克斯撤消他的提案，转而支持有利于“自然疗法”的提案，并且许以报酬。以下是他们的一段谈话的记录。
    柯克斯：嗯，你说如果我们肯干，你们愿意酬劳我的服务。好吧，我们坐下来，打开窗子说亮话。
    哈尔曼：行。
    柯克斯：你们准备付多少呢？
    哈尔曼：你认为值多少呢？
    柯克斯：我不知道。你比我内行一些。……
    柯克斯：三千五百元太少了。我想五千元还差不多。
    由于是录音，这段话无法否认。但是实在说来，议员受贿在美国是公开的秘密。下面是同一期“展望”还提出的一些例子。前州参议员薛尔曼在担任国会保险委员会委员的时候，从“美国信托保证公司”收取特别费用三千美元。前州参议员施特劳斯也从该公司收贿三千六百元。现任州参议员阿斯里从破了产的“美国信托保证公司”的前任经理那里收贿一万元。另一现任州参议员派克霍斯接受了“劳伯·李人寿保险公司”五百份股票。
