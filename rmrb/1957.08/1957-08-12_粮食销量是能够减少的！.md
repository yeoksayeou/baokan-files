According to the actual situation of grain supply in the country at present, it is very necessary to strictly control the quantity of grain sold under the unified sales system. Although the fundamental solution to the grain problem is to increase grain production, the current problem is that the increase in grain production cannot keep up with the growth rate of people's demand for grain. Therefore, in addition to continuing to work hard to increase grain production and ensure the completion of the unified grain purchase task, the most important way out at present is to restrain grain consumption as much as possible. And strictly controlling the quantity of grain sold under the unified sales system is the most reliable way to restrain grain consumption.

In the 1956-1957 period, the domestic market in our country sold more than 12.7 billion jin of grain. A large part of this was necessary; but a part could have been sold less. The situation of Shuangjiangkou Grain Station in Ningxiang County, Hunan, published on the fifth page of this newspaper yesterday, is a clear example. The three townships (Shuangjiangkou, Lianhuashan, and Quantang) under the responsibility of this grain station are concentrated rice-producing areas in Ningxiang County. Last year, the average amount of grain actually retained by the masses was more than 600 jin per person, and Yuexing Cooperative in Shuangjiangkou Township reached 800 jin. However, in June of this year, this grain station was bustling with activity, selling an average of 100,000 jin per day, and a maximum of 150,000 jin. Among the people buying grain, only a small number were really short of grain, and most were pretending to be short of grain, and some were taking the opportunity to engage in grain speculation activities. For this purpose, they disassembled and exchanged grain coupons, altered grain coupons, and privately carved grain station seals. One person could purchase thousands or even tens of thousands of jin of grain by illicit means.

According to materials from the Grain Bureaus of Hubei, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Fujian and other provinces, similar situations have occurred in some areas of these provinces. According to the materials of the Jiangxi Provincial Grain Bureau, from June 26 to 30 this year, the daily average sales of rice in the Ji'an area of the province reached 4.82 million jin. Calculated on the basis of the total agricultural population of the area, each person bought more than two jin of rice from the state every day. Eleven counties (cities) in the entire area broke the sales quota, selling more than 12 million jin of rice. In Qiuxi and Yange townships in Yongxin County, the average ration per person was 720 jin to 740 jin (unhusked rice), and the state also supplied more than 480,000 jin of unhusked rice, which greatly fueled grain speculation.

Every patriotic grain worker, every patriotic farmer, and every patriotic citizen must launch a resolute and merciless struggle against the criminal acts of purchasing grain for speculation! In order to carry out this struggle, it is necessary to strictly control and conscientiously compress the sales of grain!

Obviously, many areas have not implemented strict control over grain sales. This is true not only in cities and industrial areas, but also in vast rural areas. We must vigorously reduce grain consumption in cities and industrial areas, and we will discuss this aspect separately. Here, let's first analyze the situation of grain sales in rural areas. The grain distribution certificates of the above-mentioned Shuangjiangkou Grain Station were issued by the agricultural cooperatives "conscientiously" according to the roster. The numbers of grain needed for each household were not strictly reviewed. It was even possible to issue blank certificates and let the agricultural cooperatives fill in as much as they wanted. Of course, this makes it easy to sell more grain.

Outside of the grain stations, many district, township, and cooperative-level cadres did not carefully examine the grain supply requests submitted by the masses, and arbitrarily issued certificates, which also made it easier for the masses to purchase more grain, purchase grain illegally, and engage in other speculative activities.

Some of the areas where these phenomena occurred are bumper harvest areas. The three townships under the responsibility of Shuangjiangkou are all bumper harvest townships. In the bumper harvest provinces such as Hubei, many staff members also have a nonchalant attitude towards selling more grain. Their thinking is: Since it is a bumper harvest, shouldn't the masses be allowed to eat a little more heartily! Isn't grain just for people to eat? If the quota is exceeded, they reach out to the higher authorities to request additional allocations.

In addition, some areas are not bumper harvests, but they have also relaxed control over grain sales. Some believe that not fully satisfying the current grain supply requirements of the masses is bureaucracy, which will increase internal contradictions among the people; some even know that some people are illegally purchasing state grain for speculative trading, but do not interfere, fearing that it will affect the lives of the masses and offend the masses. Under the control of this kind of thinking, many staff members adopted the wrong attitude of "being responsive to every request" to the unreasonable grain supply requests of the masses. Obviously, this must be corrected. All cities and villages throughout the country should, without exception, reduce grain sales.

Is strictly controlling grain sales being harsh to the masses? We believe that this is definitely not the case. Members of the Wujiawan Agricultural Cooperative in Yanshi County, Henan, recently held a debate on the grain issue. They made a detailed calculation. According to a survey of 22 poor peasant households: in 1948, the average grain consumption per person was 196 jin. Now, the average farmer here eats 307 jin of net grain per year, an increase of 111 jin. Only eight well-to-do middle peasant households now eat 30 jin less grain per year than in 1948. Farmers who used to eat bran and wild herbs now eat grain. Even disaster areas are guaranteed. This fact is recognized by any farmer. Then, on the basis of the improvement of the people's grain consumption situation, asking the people to pay attention to saving, so that the country can reduce grain sales, increase grain reserves, so as to supply the needs of famine years and the needs of all aspects of grain, and strive for a better future for the people, how can this be considered harsh? This is precisely the correct embodiment of the long-term interests of the people. This is precisely the policy that a party and government that is truly responsible to the people must adopt.

On the contrary, if grain sales are not controlled, grain sales work will fall into a bottomless pit. A large amount of grain—the treasure of treasures in the construction industry—will be terribly wasted and will be embezzled by sinful speculators.

In order to strictly control grain sales, some erroneous ideas must be criticized. Staff members at all levels in various regions should understand: they are not only staff members of a certain region or unit, but also staff members of the country. On the one hand, they must be responsible to the direct objects of their service—some of the masses—and on the other hand, they must also be responsible to the entire country—the people of the whole country. When there is a conflict between local interests and overall interests, it is necessary to persuade the masses to submit to the interests of the entire country. We must know that if our own region sells more grain, it will inevitably increase the difficulties of other regions and even the entire country, affect the balance of national grain revenue and expenditure, and affect socialist construction. A responsible state staff member should never make such a mistake.

Some comrades believe that since we have already entered socialism, can we not satisfy the people's demand for eating well and eating well? In fact, this is only a one-sided reason. Grain in our country has never been abundant. From the perspective of natural conditions, the basic reason is that there are many people and little arable land, and due to economic strength and other conditions, there is no possibility of large-scale reclamation in the short term; there is also a certain limit to the increase in yield per unit area. In addition, every year, some areas (about one-tenth) suffer from various natural disasters. Before liberation, due to the feudal land system and the rule of the reactionaries, a large number of urban and rural people were trapped in a state of semi-starvation every year, and a large number of victims died. Now, this tragic situation has fundamentally changed. However, the situation of insufficient grain caused by natural conditions cannot be completely changed quickly. Before this backward economic foundation has been completely changed, if we demand too much improvement in life too early, or even hold the so-called "eating everything up" idea, it will not only hinder the socialist future of the country, but also harm the long-term interests of the masses themselves.

Now, the situation is very clear. We must immediately launch a struggle on two fronts on the grain issue nationwide. On the one hand, we must ensure the supply of the basic needs of the masses for grain. If the basic needs of the masses are not reasonably supplied, it is an extremely serious form of bureaucracy and must be resolutely corrected. But on the other hand, we must also restrain grain consumption as much as possible. If grain sales can be compressed but are not compressed, if the things that can be reviewed and confirmed are not carefully reviewed, if those who should not buy grain are allowed to buy grain at will, and even illegally purchase grain for speculative activities, disrupting the economic order of the country, and failing to conduct ideological and political education for the people, this right-leaning sentiment must also be resolutely overcome.

Party and government organs at all levels in various regions should actively organize forces to conduct universal and in-depth patriotic education and socialist education among the people, and on the basis of unified understanding, formulate specific steps and measures to implement them. According to the original calculation of the Jingou Cooperative in Chengguan Township, Xin'an County, Henan, there was a shortage of more than 28,000 jin of grain in the summer, which needed to be supplied by the state. Later, the county party committee called on everyone to save 15 jin of grain per person, and mobilized the masses to report more than 10,000 jin of old grain. Counting the more than 7,000 jin of wheat harvested from private plots and the more than 15,000 jin of early-maturing crops, the problem of grain shortage in the summer was solved by themselves, and there was no need to ask the state for supply. If this approach is expanded, grain sales will definitely be significantly reduced. Under the leadership of party and government organs, grain work organizations in various regions should cooperate with all forces to actively carry out ideological and political work and specific organizational work for agricultural cooperatives. As long as this is done, it will definitely be effective. We should firmly believe in the class consciousness of the people and actively strive to inspire and promote this consciousness!

### 粮食销量是能够减少的！

    粮食销量是能够减少的！
    根据目前全国粮食供应的实际情况看来，严格控制粮食统销数量是十分必要的。虽然解决粮食问题的根本办法是增产粮食，但是现在的问题是粮食的增产赶不上人们对粮食需要量增长的速度。因此，目前除了继续努力增加粮食的生产，保证粮食统购任务的完成以外，最重要的出路就是尽量节制粮食的消费。而严格控制粮食统销的数量，则是节制粮食消费的最可靠的办法。
    1956—1957年度，我国国内市场多销售了一百二十七亿多斤粮食。其中有很大一部分是必需的；但也有一部分是可以少销的。昨天本报第五版发表的湖南宁乡县双江口粮站的情形，就是一个明显的例子。这个粮站负责供应的三个乡（双江口、莲花山、泉塘）是宁乡县稻谷集中产区，去年群众实际留粮数量平均每人在六百斤以上，双江口乡的月星社达到八百斤。但是今年6月份这个粮站门庭若市，日销平均十万斤，最高达十五万斤。在买粮的人群中，只有很少数人是真缺粮，大部分是假装缺粮，其中一部分是乘机进行粮食投机活动。为了这个目的，他们拆换粮证，涂改粮证，私刻粮站图章，一个人可以套购成千上万斤的粮食。
    根据湖北、广西、江西、福建等省粮食厅的材料，这些省份也都有一部分地区发生类似的情形。据江西省粮食厅材料，该省吉安专区今年6月26日至30日统计，每日平均大米销量竟达到四百八十二万斤。以全区农业人口计算，每人每日向国家买了大米二斤多。全专区有十一个县（市）突破销售指标，多销大米一千二百多万斤。永新县秋溪、烟阁二乡每人平均口粮七百二十斤到七百四十斤（谷），国家还补供稻谷四十八万多斤，结果大大助长了粮食投机活动。
    每一个有爱国心的粮食工作人员，每一个有爱国心的农民，每一个有爱国心的公民，对于套购粮食进行投机的犯罪行为，都必须展开坚决无情的斗争！为了展开这个斗争，就必须严格控制和认真压缩粮食的销量！
    很明显，许多地区对于粮食的销量没有实行严格的控制。不但在城市和工业区是这样；在广大农村中也是这样。我们必须大力压缩城市和工业区的粮食消费，这一方面的问题我们要专门讨论。这里先就农村销粮的情况来做分析。上述双江口粮站的发粮证，就是交由农业社“凭良心”按花名册发给的。填写各户需粮数字都没有经过严格审查。甚至可以干脆发给空白证，由农业社自己填写多少算多少。这样当然很容易多销粮食。
    粮站以外，许多区、乡、社基层干部对于群众提出的供应粮食的要求不作认真考查，随意开给证明，这也使群众中多购和套购粮食以及其他投机活动有了方便之门。
    发生这类现象的地区，有一些是丰收地区。双江口负责供应的三个乡，就都是丰收乡。在丰收的湖北等省，也有许多工作人员对于多销粮食抱着满不在乎的态度。他们的想法是：丰收了，还不该让群众痛痛快快多吃一点！粮食不就是供人们吃的么？指标突破了，他们就伸手向上面要求增拨。
    另外有些地区并不丰收，但是也放松了对粮食销量的控制。有的认为不充分满足群众目前的供粮要求，就是官僚主义，就会增加人民内部矛盾；甚至明知有些群众套购国家粮食去做投机买卖，也不加干涉，生怕影响了群众的生活，得罪了群众。在这种思想支配下，许多工作人员对群众的不合理的供粮要求，抱了错误的“有求必应”的态度。显然这是必须纠正的。全国各地一切城市和乡村，都应该无例外地减少粮食的销量。
    严格控制粮食销量，是不是对群众苛刻呢？我们认为决不是这样。河南偃师县吴家湾农业社社员最近关于粮食问题进行了辩论。他们算了一个细账。据二十二户贫农调查：1948年常年平均每人用粮一百九十六斤，现在这里农民平均每年吃净粮三百零七斤，增加一百一十一斤。只有八户富裕中农现在一年比1948年一年少吃三十斤粮。从前吃糠咽菜的农民，现在都吃粮食。连灾区也有了保证。这种事实是任何农民都承认的。那么，在人民吃粮状况已经有了改善的基础上，要求人民注意节约，使国家减少粮食销量，增强粮食储备，以便供应荒年的需要，供应各方面对粮食的需要，为人民争取更好的前途，这怎么能算苛刻呢？这正是正确地体现了人民的长远利益。这正是真正对人民负责的政党和政府所必须采取的政策。
    相反，如果不控制粮食销量，粮食销售工作就会掉进无底洞。大量的粮食——建设事业中的宝中之宝——就会受到可怕的浪费，就会被罪恶的投机分子所盗用。
    为了严格控制粮食销量，必须批判一些错误的思想。各地各级的工作人员都应当明白：他们不只是某地区某单位的工作人员，同时也是国家的工作人员。他们一方面要对自己服务的直接对象——部分群众——负责，另一方面也要对整个国家——全国人民——负责。在局部利益和整体利益发生矛盾的时候，必须说服群众服从整个国家的利益。要知道，自己地区多销了粮食，就必然会增加别的地区以至整个国家的困难，影响国家粮食收支的平衡，影响社会主义建设。一个有责任心的国家工作人员，决不应该犯这样的错误。
    有的同志认为我们既然已经进入社会主义了，人民要求吃饱吃好，还能够不给予满足吗？其实这只是片面的道理。我国粮食历来就不充裕，从自然条件说，基本原因是人多耕地少，并且由于经济力量和其他条件的限制，短期内还没有可能大量开荒；单位面积产量的增加也有一定限度。加上每年都有部分地区（大约十分之一左右）遭受各种自然灾害。解放以前，由于封建的土地制度和反动派的统治，每年都有大批城乡人口陷于半饥饿状态，都有大批灾民死亡。现在，这种悲惨的情况根本改变了。但是，由于自然条件产生的粮食不充裕状况，还不可能很快地彻底改变。在这种落后的经济基础还未得到彻底改变以前，如果过早地要求过多的生活改善，甚至抱了所谓“吃光主义”，那就不但会妨碍国家的社会主义前途，而且对群众自己的长远利益同样有害。
    现在，情况已经很清楚了。我们必须立即在全国范围内展开在粮食问题上的两条战线的斗争。一方面我们必须保证供应群众对粮食的基本需要。如果对群众的基本需要不进行合理的供应，那是极端严重的官僚主义，必须坚决改正。但是另一方面，我们又必须尽量节制粮食的消费。如果粮食的销量能够压缩而没有压缩，能够审查确实的事情不作认真审查，放任那些不该买粮的群众随意买粮，以至套购粮食去作投机活动，破坏国家的经济秩序，也不对人民进行思想和政治教育，这种右倾情绪也必须坚决克服。
    各地党政机关应当积极组织力量，对人民群众进行普遍深入的爱国教育和社会主义教育，在统一认识的基础上，订出具体的步骤和措施，贯彻执行。河南新安县城关乡金沟社原来计算，夏季缺粮二万八千多斤，需要国家供应。后来县委号召大家每人节约十五斤粮食，又发动群众报出陈粮一万多斤，再算上自留地收麦七千多斤，早熟作物一万五千多斤，结果夏季缺粮问题就自己解决，不要求国家供应了。把这样的作法扩展开去，粮食销量就一定能够有显著的缩减。各地粮食工作机构应该在党政机关的领导下，同各方面力量配合起来，积极对农业社进行思想政治工作和具体的组织工作。只要这样做了，就一定能够收效。我们应当坚决地相信人民群众的阶级觉悟，并积极努力启发和推进这种觉悟！
