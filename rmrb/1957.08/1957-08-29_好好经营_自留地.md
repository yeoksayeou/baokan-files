　　Manage the "Private Plots" Well
　　Chen Zhao
　　Many agricultural cooperatives have already increased the private plots for their members in order to help them solve the problem of pig feed. However, increasing the private plots does not mean that all problems are solved. Have the increased private plots really helped members obtain more feed? Is the use of private plots completely appropriate? What difficulties do members have in managing their private plots? These are all things worth paying attention to.
　　The Rural Work Department of the Linchuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Jiangxi Province once inspected the use of private plots in five agricultural cooperatives and found that the use of private plots was not entirely reasonable; some land was even left uncultivated. For example, Minle and Huaguang cooperatives and one team of Huanan cooperative in this county added a total of more than 254 mu of private plots for their members, plus the original private plots, totaling more than 366 mu. Among these lands, rice, miscellaneous grains, and cash crops occupied a considerable area, while vegetables and feed crops did not occupy a large area. In addition, 30.27 mu of private land were left uncultivated, without being planted in time.
　　Originally, when these agricultural cooperatives increased the private plots, they did not consider the actual needs of each member or the specific situation of each cooperative, but mechanically allocated them according to the average population of 5% of the total cultivated land. As a result, some households could not cultivate so many private plots. These cooperatives also did not choose the private plots appropriately; most of the increased private plots were paddy fields, which were not suitable for growing dryland crops. These cooperatives also did not help solve the problems of labor, fertilizer, and seeds required for managing private plots after increasing the private plots; Huanan cooperative even forbade members from composting fertilizer in private manure pits, which dampened the enthusiasm of members for managing private plots. The above are the reasons why the use of private plots is not entirely reasonable and why land is left uncultivated.
　　According to the Linchuan County Committee, it is not only the inspected cooperatives that have not used private plots reasonably, but a common phenomenon. Other regions and agricultural cooperatives should also pay attention to and inspect this.
　　Reasonable use of private plots seems to be a trivial matter, but it is directly related to the personal interests of the members and the collective interests of the cooperative. If the agricultural cooperative cannot help the members manage their private plots well under the condition of doing a good job in collective production, the contradiction between the members and the cooperative will increase, and the members' enthusiasm for production will be affected. Furthermore, this year, because the number of private plots of members in agricultural cooperatives in various places has increased a lot, the cultivated land collectively managed by agricultural cooperatives has relatively decreased. If hundreds or thousands of mu of private land in a cooperative are not well cultivated, it is not only a loss to the members personally, but also a loss to the entire agricultural production.
　　The leading organs and agricultural cooperatives in various counties and townships should conduct an inspection on the use of private plots by members as soon as possible to help the members make full use of the unutilized private plots (such as rushing to plant late autumn crops and autumn vegetables). If the allocation of private plots is inappropriate, appropriate adjustments should be made under the principle of voluntary participation by the members to ensure that no land is wasted. The procurement tasks of private plots should also be clarified to the members as soon as possible to eliminate the members' concerns about managing private plots. In the season when field management is very tight, it is most likely to happen that the members' private plots compete with the large areas of land in the cooperative for labor and fertilizer. This requires overall consideration and proper arrangement, so as to ensure that the large areas of land are well managed, and also to leave the members with some time to manage their private plots; to ensure that the large areas of land have as much fertilizer as possible, and also to allow the members to apply the fertilizer needed for their private plots. We must strive to achieve a bumper harvest in both the large areas of land in the agricultural cooperative and the members' private plots!

### 好好经营“自留地”

　　好好经营“自留地”
　　陈昭
    许多农业社为了帮助社员解决养猪饲料问题，已经给社员增补了一部分自留地。但是，增加了自留地，不等于什么问题都解决了。较多的自留地是否真正帮助社员取得了更多的饲料？自留地的使用是否完全得当？社员经营自留地有什么困难？这些，都是值得注意的事情。
    中共江西省临川县委农村工作部曾经检查过五个农业社自留地的使用情况，发现自留地的使用不尽合理；还有部分土地被撩荒了。例如，这个县的民乐、华光两个社和华南一社的一个队，共给社员增留了二百五十四亩多自留地，加上原有的自留地，共有三百六十六亩多。在这些土地当中，水稻、杂粮和经济作物占去了相当大的面积，蔬菜和饲料作物占的面积并不很多，此外还有三十点二七亩的自留地荒在那里，没有及时种上。
    原来这几个农业社在增补自留地的时候，不是根据各个社员的实际需要，没有顾及各个社的具体情况，而是机械地按耕地总数的5％的比例，按人口平均分配。结果，有的户就种不了那么多的自留地。这几个社对于自留地的挑选也不够合适，增补的自留地大部分都是水田，不适于种旱作物。这些社在增补了自留地后，也没有帮助解决经营自留地所需的劳力、肥料、种籽等问题；华南一社还不准社员在私人粪窖沤肥，打击了社员经营自留地的积极性。上面这些，都是自留地使用不尽合理和撩荒的原因。
    据临川县委了解，没有合理使用自留地的不只是检查过的那几个社，而是普遍的现象。其他地区和农业社也应当对此加以注意和检查。
    合理使用自留地，看来是件小事情，但是这却直接关系着社员个人利益和合作社的集体利益，如果农业社不能在搞好集体生产的条件下帮助社员把自留地经营好，社员和社之间的矛盾就会增加，社员的生产积极性就会受到影响。再说，今年由于各地农业社中的社员自留地数量增加了不少，农业社集体经营的耕地就相对地减少了。如果一个社的几百亩或者上千亩的自留地没有种好，不但是社员个人的损失，而且是整个农业生产上的损失。
    各地县、乡领导机关和农业社，最好对社员自留地的使用情况作一次检查，帮助社员赶快把没有利用的自留地充分利用起来（如抢种晚秋作物和秋菜等）。自留地分配不当的，应该在社员自愿的原则下作适当的调剂，保证不荒废一分土地。自留地的征购任务，也应该早向社员讲清楚，以便打消社员经营自留地的疑虑。在田间管理非常紧张的季节，最容易发生社员自留地跟社内大片土地争工、争肥料的矛盾，这就必须统筹兼顾，妥善安排，既要保证把大片土地管理好，也要给社员留下一点管理自留地的时间；既要保证大片土地有尽可能多的肥料，也要让社员有可能施上自留地所需要的肥料。我们要努力争取农业社的大片土地和社员自留地一齐丰收！
