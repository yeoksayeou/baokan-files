　　Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, August 25th: A piece of hail too big for one person to hold fell on the fields next to Dazuo Village in Lingqiu County.

　　According to Wang Shaozhong, an official from the Lingqiu County Agricultural Construction Bureau who witnessed the hail falling, this large hailstone fell on the afternoon of August 11th, while the rest of the hail was the same as usual.

　　This hailstone was three chi in diameter and more than two chi high. Local cadres and farmers who went to see it estimated that it weighed more than one hundred jin.

　　Staff from the Shanxi Provincial Meteorological Bureau said that hailstones are formed when hot air rises from the ground in summer and cold air descends from the sky, causing strong convection. The stronger the hot air, the more intense the convection. Shanxi Province, due to its mountainous terrain, experiences stronger convection than other areas. When small hailstones fall from the sky, they are pushed back up by the hot air. The more times this happens, the more moisture is added to the hailstone, and the larger it becomes. That's why such large hailstones occasionally appear.

　  一人抱不住的大冰雹
    新华社太原25日电　一颗一人抱不住的大冰雹落在灵丘县大作村旁的田地里。
    据看到这个冰雹降落的灵丘县农业建设局干部王绍中说，这个大冰雹降落的时间是在8月11日下午，其余的冰雹都和常见的一样。
    这个冰雹有三尺粗，二尺多高，当地前往观看的干部和农民，估计它重一百多斤。
    山西省气象局工作人员说，冰雹是在夏天地面的热空气上升，空中冷气下降，发生强烈的对流时形成的。热气越强，对流就越激烈，山西省又因多山，对流程度比一般地区强，小雹子从空中下落时又被热空气顶上去，这样上下次数越多，冰雹周围附加的水分愈多，冰雹就愈大，所以有时偶而会有这样大的冰雹出现。
