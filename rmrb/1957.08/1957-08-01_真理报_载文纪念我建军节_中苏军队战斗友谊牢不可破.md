Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 31st. The Soviet "Pravda" today published an article by General Beloborodov to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, saying that the militant friendship between the armed forces of the Soviet Union and China is an inseparable part of the brotherly friendship between the two peoples.

The article, entitled "The Glorious Army of a Great People," stated that tomorrow marks the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The Soviet people, together with their friends and allies, the Chinese people, solemnly commemorate this glorious day.

The article pointed out that the People's Liberation Army has grown and strengthened in the struggle for the happiness of its motherland, has been tempered, and has become a strong and invincible force fighting for the liberation of its people, and has achieved great victories in this struggle. The People's Liberation Army has achieved great victories because it has consistently followed the invincible doctrine of Marxism-Leninism in its struggle, because it has received the support and assistance of the broad masses of workers and peasants in China, and because the glorious Communist Party guides its activities.

The article said that we Soviet soldiers have always watched the heroic and great struggles of the glorious Chinese people's army over the years with great interest and friendly concern. Between 1934 and 1935, we read with excitement the news of the Chinese Red Army's miraculous Long March. This Long March was unprecedented in history, and it provided the world with the highest example of the heroism, perseverance, and heroism of revolutionary fighters.

Referring to the War of Resistance Against Japan, the article said that the glorious achievements of the Chinese People's Army, as well as the extensive guerrilla warfare carried out by the Communists in the rear of the Japanese-occupied areas, were one of the factors that prevented militarist Japan from attacking the Soviet Union from behind when Hitler's Germany treacherously attacked the Soviet Union.

The article then went on to say that the heroic struggle of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in the Liberation War eliminated the danger of China becoming a colony of American monopoly capital.

The article said that since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the People's Liberation Army has firmly defended the achievements of the revolution and the peaceful labor of the Chinese working people, preventing enemy invasion. This is a modern, powerful, and regular army whose strength and power play an important role in stabilizing the situation in the Far East and consolidating peace and security in Asia and the world.

The article concluded by saying that there are fraternal friendly and mutual assistance ties between the Soviet armed forces and the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The militant friendship between the armed forces of the Soviet Union and China is solid and indestructible.

    “真理报”载文纪念我建军节
    中苏军队战斗友谊牢不可破
    新华社莫斯科31日电　苏联“真理报”今天刊载的别洛鲍罗多夫上将为纪念中国人民解放军建军三十周年而写的文章说，苏联和中国武装部队的战斗友谊是两国人民兄弟友谊的不可分割的一部分。
    这篇题为“伟大人民的光荣军队”的文章说，明天是中国人民解放军诞生三十周年。苏联人民同自己的朋友和同盟者中国人民一道隆重地纪念这个光辉的日子。
    文章指出，人民解放军在为自己祖国幸福的战斗中成长壮大起来，得到了锻炼，成了为解放自己的人民而斗争的一支强大、不可战胜的力量，并且在这一斗争中取得了伟大的胜利。人民解放军所以取得伟大的胜利，是因为它在斗争中一贯遵循着不可战胜的马克思列宁主义学说，是因为它得到了中国广大工农群众的支持和帮助，是因为光荣的共产党指导着它的活动。
    文章说，我们苏联军人一直怀着浓厚的兴趣和友好的关心注视着中国人民的光荣军队许多年来所进行的英勇、伟大的斗争。在1934—1935年间，我们曾经怀着激动的心情阅读中国红军神奇的长征的消息。这次长征在历史上是空前的，它向全世界提供了革命战士的英勇、坚毅和英雄主义的最高范例。
    文章在谈到抗日战争时说，中国人民军队的光辉战绩，以及共产党人在日本占领区后方所开展的广泛的游击战争，是使得军国主义日本在希特勒德国背信弃义进攻苏联时不敢从背后夹攻苏联的因素之一。
    文章接着谈到中国人民解放军在解放战争中的英勇斗争消除了使中国沦为美国垄断资本的殖民地的危险。
    文章说，在中华人民共和国成立以后，人民解放军巩固地保卫着革命的成果和中国劳动人民的和平劳动，防止敌人的侵犯。这是一支现代化的强大的正规军，它的力量和威力在稳定远东局势、巩固亚洲和全世界的和平、安全方面起着重要的作用。
    文章最后说，苏联武装部队同中国人民解放军之间有兄弟般的友好互助联系。苏联和中国武装部队的战斗友谊是巩固的、牢不可破的。
