Xinhua News Agency, July 31st: On the eve of "August 1st," all sectors of the people of Beijing held a grand garden party of over 20,000 people to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army ("August 1st" Army Day). Zhongshan Park, to the right of Tiananmen Square, was illuminated by lights, resembling a celestial palace. Various colorful lanterns, adorned on the branches of trees, illuminated the entire garden in a riot of color. Large groups of male and female workers, young students, cadres, and Young Pioneers, with excited and joyful hearts, joined the officers and soldiers of the great motherland's defenders – the People's Liberation Army – and poured into the park side by side, to celebrate this glorious festival together.

Party and state leaders Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, and Deng Xiaoping all participated in tonight's garden party. Also participating in the garden party were the marshals and generals of the People's Republic of China, as well as leaders of various democratic parties and people's organizations.

The garden party began at approximately 9 o'clock. Immediately, the entire garden erupted in cheers. Performance troupes composed of twelve art groups began to perform various excellent programs. On the lawns, under the shade of trees, and on the wide open spaces, many vortices of joy formed. In the tide of people in colorful attire, naval sailors' black ribbons fluttered, and the officers' golden epaulettes and the generals' gleaming medals on their chests glittered. Look, many university students and naval soldiers who had been tempered in the anti-rightist struggle were dancing a group dance; they are all warriors who defend socialism. In another venue, air force pilots were surrounded by young workers; these are also soldiers on two fronts. A group of children with red scarves fluttered around, shouting excitedly: "Uncle PLA!"...Every corner here was filled with the moving friendship between the people's armed forces and the people, and everyone here was proud of the strength of their armed forces and its glorious war history.

What moving scenes appeared on this night! The female students of Beijing No. 13 and No. 12 Middle Schools were especially grateful to the People's Liberation Army for protecting their peaceful learning lives. They innocently performed the dance "Happy Children" for the logistics soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. The young female workers of Beijing State-owned Cotton Mill No. 1 and State-owned Cotton Mill No. 3 were dressed especially beautifully today, and they held the hands of railway soldiers tightly as they danced ballroom dances. As soon as the music stopped, they spoke warmly about the mountain-moving and sea-filling projects on the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway line and the increase in production in the textile factories.

People especially respected the heroes with medals on their chests. People surrounded the two old Red Army soldiers, Captain Tao Haichuan and Captain Li Yun, who wore the third-class "August 1st" Medal, listening to them tell stories of the Long March and the struggles in northern Shaanxi.

Wu Xingyi, a second lieutenant in the engineering corps who graduated from the Department of Electrical Engineering of Zhejiang University, and four other university students who had just received their military ranks today were particularly excited. For the first time in their lives, they were respected as soldiers. At the meeting, Wu Xingyi told reporters: I wanted to be a soldier in the People's Liberation Army a long time ago, and my wish has only come true today. I will definitely contribute everything I have to defend the motherland and build a modern national defense.

In the circle of Peking University students and artillery soldiers, applause suddenly surged like a tide in one direction. Vice Chairman Zhu De, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Marshal Chen Yi, Marshal He Long, and Marshal Nie Rongzhen entered one after another, dancing with the young people in the melodious music. After a while, the students of Peking University discovered Premier Zhou, and they immediately invited the Premier to play with them. Premier Zhou accepted the invitation and watched the students' performance.

The Song and Dance Troupe of the General Political Department is performing the chorus "Forward! People's Liberation Army" in the square.

In the music hall, famous Peking Opera actors performed wonderful programs such as "Fishing and Killing the Family" and "Eliminating the Three Evils" for the park-goers. Liu Shaoqi and Zhou Enlai came here one after another and enjoyed the Peking Opera with everyone. (Attached pictures)

    欢腾之夜
    ——记庆祝建军节的游园晚会
    ·新华社记者·
    据新华社31日讯　“八一”前夜，北京市各界人民为庆祝“八一”建军节三十周年，举行二万多人的盛大游园晚会。天安门右侧的中山公园，灯火辉映，宛如仙宫。缀满树枝的各色彩灯，把满园照耀得五彩缤纷。大队大队的男女工人、青年学生、干部和少先队员们怀着振奋欢悦的心情，同伟大祖国的保卫者——解放军的军官和士兵们并肩涌入园内，共同欢度这一光荣节日。
    党和国家的领导人刘少奇、周恩来、朱德、邓小平都参加了今晚的游园会。参加游园会的还有中华人民共和国元帅们和将军们，以及各民主党派、各人民团体的负责人。
    游园晚会在九时许开始。顿时满园腾起一片欢声。由十二个文艺团体组成的演出队，开始演出各种精采节目。在草坪上，林荫下和宽阔的场地上，形成了许多欢乐的旋涡。在服色绚丽的人潮中，飘扬着水兵的黑色飘带，闪耀着军官们金色的肩章和将军们胸前闪闪发光的勋章。看吧，许多在反右派斗争中经过锻炼的大学生和海军战士们在跳集体舞，他们同样都是保卫社会主义的战士；在另一个场地上，空军飞行员被青年工人们包围了，这也是两个战线上的士兵；一群飘着红领巾的孩子们拥来，他们兴奋的喊着：“解放军叔叔！”……这里每一个角落都洋溢着人民武装部队和人民之间的动人友情，这里每一个人都为自己武装部队的强大和它的光荣战史而自豪。
    在这一夜，出现了多少动人的场面！北京市女十三中和女十二中的女学生们特别感激解放军保卫了她们的安宁的学习生活。她们天真地为解放军后勤战士们表演了舞蹈“欢乐的儿童”。北京市国棉一厂和国棉三厂的青年女工们今天打扮得特别漂亮，她们紧紧拉着铁道兵战士的手跳起了交谊舞。音乐声一停，他们就亲切地谈起了鹰厦线上移山填海的工程和纺织厂里的增产情况。
    人们特别尊敬胸前佩带勋章的功臣们。人们围着两位带着三级“八一”勋章的老红军战士陶海川大尉和李云大尉，听他们讲述长征故事和陕北的斗争。
    浙江大学电机系毕业的工程兵少尉吴兴义等五位今天刚刚接受军衔的大学生，特别兴奋。他们平生第一次作为一个军人受到人们的尊敬。在会上，吴兴义对记者说：我很早就想当一个解放军战士，今天才实现了愿望。我一定要为保卫祖国、建设现代化的国防事业贡献出我的一切。
    在北京大学学生和炮兵战士的圆圈里，掌声突然像潮水一般涌往一个方向，朱德副主席、刘少奇委员长、陈毅元帅、贺龙元帅和聂荣臻元帅先后走进来了，他们同年青人一起在悠扬的音乐声中踏着舞步。过了一会儿，北大的同学们发现了周总理，他们马上邀请总理同他们一起玩，周总理接受了邀请，观看了学生们的表演。
    总政治部文工团歌舞团在广场上正在演出大合唱“前进！人民解放军”。
    在音乐堂里，著名的京剧演员为游园群众演出了“打渔杀家”和“除三害”等精采节目。刘少奇、周恩来先后来到这里和大家一道欣赏了京剧。（附图片）
