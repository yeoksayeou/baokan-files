Full of Lies, Half a Truth
By Our Staff Commentator

U.S. President Eisenhower has submitted to Congress a report on the implementation of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" over the past six months. This report contains nothing but empty boasting about the so-called "progress" of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" in the Middle East. In reality, this report is nothing but a tissue of lies.

Eisenhower first boasted that the purpose of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is to "promote peace and stability in the Middle East," and that the United States has made "progress" in this regard because "it makes it impossible for potential armed aggressors to make miscalculations." But how exactly has the "Eisenhower Doctrine" "promoted" "peace and stability" in the Middle East in the past six months? Everyone knows that the first step of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" was to create a political crisis in Jordan. In this event, the United States even dispatched the Sixth Fleet, and even the British press believed that the United States was pursuing a "gunboat policy" of 19th-century colonialism in the Middle East. After that, the United States tried its best to provoke relations between Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Egypt and Syria, undermining the unity of Arab countries in order to isolate Egypt and Syria, and plotted subversive conspiracies within Egypt and Syria. Not only that, the United States continued to support Israel's illegal demands to attempt to infringe upon the Arab territorial waters of the Gulf of Aqaba; and instigated Israel to carry out armed provocations against the Syrian border. The United States also directly participated in the military committee of the Baghdad Pact, strengthening its aggressive activities of establishing military bases in the Middle East and stationing the Eastern Mediterranean Fleet. Can it be said that these are manifestations of "peace and stability" in the Middle East?

Eisenhower said that his "doctrine" stopped the actions of possible "armed aggressors" in the Middle East. He also once again repeated the hackneyed tune of the so-called "international communist threat." However, the facts of the past six months have fully proved that there is no "communist" "threat" in the Middle East at all, and the "armed aggressors" are by no means "international communists." Therefore, there is no need for the United States to worry about something that is nonexistent. The undeniable truth is that the open "armed aggressors" in the Middle East are none other than the Western colonial countries that the United States calls "allies." Isn't France cruelly attacking the people of Algeria? Isn't Britain frantically attacking the insurgents of Yemen and Oman? Then, why is the United States, which claims to be the "defender" of peace in the Middle East, unwilling to extinguish the flames of war in Algeria and Oman; why is the United States, which claims to be the "protector" of the independence of Arab countries, unwilling to stop the armed aggression of Britain and France? Moreover, isn't it under the encouragement and support of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" that Britain and France dare to carry out aggression so recklessly?

After covering up the essence of this aggressive policy of the United States, Eisenhower vigorously boasted about how "particularly successful" his special envoy Richards was in promoting the "Eisenhower Doctrine" in the Middle East, and how the "doctrine" was "approved" by Middle Eastern countries.

Here, Eisenhower is obviously deceiving himself and others. During Richards' trip to the Middle East, some Middle Eastern governments did support him. But as the American press said at the time, these governments of the Baghdad Pact member states had already thrown themselves into the arms of the United States, and it is not surprising that they cheered for the "Eisenhower Doctrine." What is important is the popular sentiment in the Middle East. The British "Manchester Guardian" wrote on July 26, when discussing American Middle East policy: "This policy relies entirely on those governments, regardless of the masses," and in fact, "American actions have aroused the fear and complaints of Arab nationalism." In other words, in the past six months, the people of the Middle East have seen through the essence of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" and the true face of American colonialists through many practical lessons. "Down with the Eisenhower Doctrine" is the universal cry of the Middle Eastern people.

Of course, it would be a bit unfair to say that the US President did not tell even half a truth in his report. One point mentioned by Eisenhower is quite important. He wanted everyone to know that "in achieving American goals, success is due to the comprehensiveness of American policy." The U.S. President did not explicitly say what the so-called "comprehensiveness" of American policy is. Therefore, even if it is the truth, it is only half a truth. In fact, "comprehensiveness" is the "global strategy" that the United States often talks about in the past, which is the ambitious plan to establish American hegemony in the world. An article titled "Middle East Strategy" written by Baldwin, the military editor of the "New York Times," published in the American "Foreign Affairs Quarterly" in July this year, can be used as a footnote to this half-truth. He said that the ultimate goal of the American Middle East policy is not only to control the Middle East itself, but also to control Western Europe by monopolizing Middle Eastern oil; to control the hub of Europe, Asia, and Africa and the gateway to Africa by possessing the Middle East; and to threaten the "heartland" of the Soviet Union by establishing a network of military bases in the Middle East.

In this way, although Eisenhower himself was hesitant to speak, the editor of the "New York Times" expressed his unfinished intentions. The set of self-promotion about the "Eisenhower Doctrine" can stop!

    满纸谎言，半句实话
    本报评论员
    美国总统艾森豪威尔向国会提出了一个关于半年来“艾森豪威尔主义”执行情况的报告。这个报告除了空空洞洞地吹嘘“艾森豪威尔主义”在中东的所谓“进展”以外，没有什么东西。实际上，这篇报告只是满纸谎言而已。
    艾森豪威尔首先吹嘘说，“艾森豪威尔主义”的目的是在于“促进中东的和平与稳定”，而美国在这方面已有了“进展”，因为“它使可能的武装侵略者没有可能作出错误估计”。可是，“艾森豪威尔主义”半年来究竟是怎样在中东“促进”了“和平与稳定”的呢？谁都知道，“艾森豪威尔主义”的第一步是制造了约旦的政治危机。在这个事件中，美国甚至出动了第六舰队，就连英国报刊也认为美国在中东奉行了十九世纪殖民主义的“炮舰政策”。在这之后，美国竭力挑拨沙特阿拉伯、约旦同埃及、叙利亚的关系，破坏阿拉伯国家的团结，以孤立埃及、叙利亚，并且在埃、叙两国内部策划了颠覆阴谋。不仅如此，美国还继续支持以色列企图侵犯阿拉伯领水亚喀巴湾的非法要求；指使以色列向叙利亚边境进行武装挑衅。美国还直接参加了巴格达条约集团的军事委员会，加强了它在中东地区建立军事基地和驻东地中海舰队的侵略活动。难道可以说，这些是中东的“和平与稳定”的表现吗？
    艾森豪威尔说，他的这个“主义”制止了可能的“武装侵略者”在中东的行动。他并且又一次重复了所谓“国际共产主义威胁”的滥调。可是，半年多的事实充分证明了中东根本不存在“共产主义”的什么“威胁”，“武装侵略者”也决不是“国际共产主义”。因此，根本就不需要有劳美国去杞人忧天。千真万确的事实是，在中东的公开的“武装侵略者”不是别人，正是美国称之为“盟国”的西方殖民国家。法国不是正在残酷地进攻阿尔及利亚的人民吗？英国不是正在疯狂地进攻着也门和阿曼的起义者吗？那末，为什么以中东和平的“维护者”自居的美国，偏偏不去扑灭阿尔及利亚和阿曼的战火；为什么以阿拉伯各国独立的“保护人”自居的美国，又偏偏不去制止英国和法国的武装侵略？而且，英国和法国难道不是在“艾森豪威尔主义”的鼓舞和撑腰之下，才敢于这样不顾一切地进行侵略的吗？
    艾森豪威尔在掩盖了美国这个侵略政策的实质以后，就大事吹嘘他的特使理查兹到中东去推销“艾森豪威尔主义”如何得到“特别成功”，这个“主义”又如何得到中东国家的“赞成”。
    这里，艾森豪威尔显然是在自欺欺人。在理查兹中东之行的过程中，确实有一些中东国家的政府为他捧过场。但是正如当时美国报刊所说的，像巴格达条约集团成员国的这些政府本来就已投到了美国的怀抱，它们为“艾森豪威尔主义”摇旗呐喊，是丝毫也不足为奇的。重要的是中东人心向背。7月26日的英国“曼彻斯特卫报”在论及美国中东政策时就写道：“这个政策完全是依赖那些政府，而不顾及群众”，而事实上“美国的行动引起了阿拉伯民族主义的恐惧和抱怨”。也就是说，这半年多来，中东人民已经通过许多实际教训看清了“艾森豪威尔主义”的实质，看清了美国殖民者的真面目。“打倒艾森豪威尔主义”，这才是中东人民的普遍的呼声。
    当然，说美国总统在他的报告中连半句老实话也没有说，这未免有些冤枉了他。艾森豪威尔提到的有一点倒颇关重要。他要大家知道，“在达到美国的目标方面，成绩是由于美国政策的总体性而产生的。”美国总统没有明说，所谓美国政策的“总体性”，究竟是什么。因此，即使是老实话，也只是半句。其实，“总体性”也者，就是美国过去常说的“全球战略”，也就是建立美国独霸世界的野心计划。今年7月出版的美国“外交季刊”上有一篇“纽约时报”军事编辑鲍德温所写的题为“中东战略”的文章，可以作为这半句老实话的注脚。他说，美国中东政策的最终目的还不仅仅限于控制中东本身，而且是为了通过霸占中东石油而控制西欧；通过据有中东而控制欧、亚、非三大洲的枢纽和非洲的门户；通过建立中东军事基地网而威胁苏联的“腹心地带”。
    这样，虽然艾森豪威尔自己欲语还休，吞吞吐吐，而“纽约时报”的这位编辑先生却道出了他的未尽之意。关于“艾森豪威尔主义”的那一套自我捧场，可以休矣！
