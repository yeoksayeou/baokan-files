    Fulfill Grain Purchase Quotas Resolutely; Strictly Control Consumption Targets
    Various Regions Adopt Measures to Strengthen Unified Grain Purchase and Sales Work
    Compensate Deficiencies with Surpluses
    Sichuan Increases Purchase of 16% of Increased Production
    (Reported) The Sichuan Provincial People's Committee recently held a meeting of commissioners and mayors to discuss this year's unified grain purchase and sales and autumn agricultural tax collection work.
    Sichuan's agricultural production has seen consecutive years of good harvests. According to the principle of "compensating deficiencies with surpluses" in unified grain purchase, Sichuan will increase grain purchases by approximately 16% of the province's planned increase in production. The meeting believed that it is necessary to carry out a socialist education movement in rural areas, crush the conspiracies of landlords and rich peasants to sabotage unified purchase and sales, and criticize the capitalist thinking of prosperous middle peasants in order to implement the policy of considering the interests of the state, agricultural cooperatives, and cooperative members.
    In government agencies, enterprises, and among urban residents, it is also necessary to vigorously promote saving grain and supplementing with coarse grains and potatoes, sharing weal and woe with the peasants.
    Fujian Decides: Grain Retention Standards May Not Be Increased Arbitrarily
    (Reported) The Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a telephone conference of secretaries of local (municipal) committees on the 10th, demanding that all localities strengthen unified grain purchase and sales work.
    The progress of summer grain purchase in Fujian Province this year is slower than in the same period last year, while grain sales have increased compared to the same period last year (grain sales across the province in July were 15 million jin more than in the same period last year). Therefore, the meeting proposed the following measures: (1) All localities should immediately begin carrying out socialist propaganda movements in rural areas, focusing on criticizing the departmentalism and tailism of cadres, and criticizing the individualistic thinking of peasants who only care about themselves and not the state; legal sanctions should be imposed on landlords and rich peasants who sabotage unified purchase and sales. (2) Resolutely fulfill the summer grain purchase task; grain retention standards should be in accordance with the "Three Fixes" and may not be increased arbitrarily. The amount of retained grain should be limited to the time of the autumn harvest. (3) Immediately take measures to strictly control grain sales.
    Yunnan Provincial Committee Requires
    All Localities to Formulate Grain Consumption Plans by Household
    (Reported) At a recent meeting of Yunnan prefectural committee secretaries, the issue of grain purchase was studied. The Yunnan Provincial Committee emphasized that in grain work, on the one hand, the original "Three Fixes" standards must be strictly followed, and on the other hand, distribution work must be done well based on the principle of distribution according to work and the historical conditions of different regions.
    In the past, localities generally did not have a clear understanding of grain supply, which led to expanded supply.
    The Provincial Committee also especially emphasized opposing departmentalism and that any behavior of concealing yields must be criticized.
    In the future, in principle, free grain markets will be abolished, except in areas with abundant grain and inconvenient transportation.
    The Provincial Committee requires all localities to carefully calculate and save grain, and to universally promote the formulation of grain consumption plans by household.
    "Three Fixes" Standards Cannot Be Shaken
    Zhejiang Holds Meeting to Oppose Right-Wing Thought
    (Reported) A recent meeting of county and prefectural committee secretaries convened by the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out that a small number of party members and cadres in rural areas currently have right-wing thoughts on the grain issue, which has led some people to claim shortages when there are none, report more shortages than exist, and take the opportunity to make trouble. In fact, the current grain rations in Zhejiang Province generally exceed the consumption levels of the original poor and lower-middle peasants, so those who truly oppose unified grain purchase and sales are only a portion of landlords, rich peasants, and a small number of prosperous peasants.
    The meeting believed that the contradiction between grain production and demand cannot fundamentally change for a considerably long period of time. In the future, in addition to prioritizing the development of grain production, it is imperative to adhere to the "Three Fixes" indicators in distribution and must not be shaken in any way.
    The meeting pointed out that the struggle between two roads in rural areas is still very sharp. In order to make socialist thought occupy an absolute advantage in rural areas, it is necessary to carry out a socialist education for the peasants, criticize right-wing thoughts within the party, criticize the capitalist and individualistic thoughts of prosperous middle peasants, and thoroughly expose and strike at words and deeds that sabotage agricultural cooperativization and unified grain purchase and sales. Class education should be strengthened for the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

    坚决完成征购任务　严格控制消费指标
    各地采取措施加强粮食统购统销工作
    以丰补歉
    四川增购增产部分的16％
    本报讯　四川省人民委员会最近召开的专员、市长会议，讨论了今年粮食统购统销和农业税秋征工作。
    四川农业生产连年丰收，根据粮食统购“以丰补歉”的原则，四川今年增购粮食占全省粮食计划增产部分的16％左右。会议认为，必需在农村开展社会主义教育运动，粉碎地主富农破坏统购统销的阴谋，批判富裕中农的资本主义思想，以贯彻国家、农业社和社员三者利益兼顾的政策。
    在机关、企业和城市居民中，也要大力宣传节约粮食，搭配杂粮、薯类，同农民共甘苦。
    福建决定：不得随意提高留粮标准
    本报讯　中共福建省委于10日召开各地（市）委书记电话会议，要求各地加强粮食统购统销工作。
    福建省今年夏粮征购进度比去年同期缓慢，而粮食销售量却比去年同期增加（7月份全省粮食销量比去年同期多销一千五百万斤）。因此，会议提出了下列几项措施：（1）各地应立即开始在农村中进行社会主义的宣传运动，并着重批判干部的本位主义和尾巴主义思想，批判农民中只顾个人不顾国家的个人主义思想；对破坏统购统销的地主富农给予法律制裁。（2）坚决完成夏粮统购任务；要按“三定”留粮标准不得随意提高留粮标准。留粮数以接秋为限。（3）立即采取措施严格控制粮食销量。
    云南省委要求
    各地按户制定用粮计划
    本报讯　最近召开的云南地委书记会议上，研究了粮食征购问题。云南省委强调，在粮食工作上，一方面要严格遵照原来的“三定”标准，一方面要根据按劳取酬的原则和不同地区的历史情况作好分配工作。
    过去，各地普遍对粮食供应不摸底，因此扩大了供应。
    省委还特别强调反对本位主义，对隐瞒产量的行为必需加以批判。
    今后，除在粮食多而交通不便的地区外，原则上取缔粮食自由市场。
    省委要求各地精打细算，节约粮食，普遍推行按户制定用粮计划。
    “三定”标准不能动摇
    浙江开会反对右倾思想
    本报讯　中共浙江省委最近召开的县委、地委书记会议指出，当前农村中有少数党员、干部在粮食问题上有右倾思想，因此使有些人在粮食问题上不缺叫缺，缺少报多，乘机取闹。实际上，浙江省现在的粮食定量，一般都超过原来贫农和下中农的消费水平，所以真正反对粮食统购统销的，只是一部分地主、富农和少数富裕农民。
    会议认为，粮食产需的矛盾，在一个相当长的时期内不可能有根本变化。今后除优先发展粮食生产外，在分配上，必须坚持按“三定”指标办事，不可有任何动摇。
    会议指出，当前农村中两条道路的斗争还很尖锐。为了使社会主义思想在农村中占绝对优势，需要向农民开展一次社会主义教育，批判党内右倾思想，批判富裕中农的资本主义思想和个人主义思想，彻底揭发和打击破坏农业合作化和粮食统购统销的言行。对广大贫农、下中农要加强阶级教育。
