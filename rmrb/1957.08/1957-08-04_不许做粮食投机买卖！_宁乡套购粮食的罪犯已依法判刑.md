Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 2nd. The Ningxiang County in Hunan Province recently uncovered a criminal group engaged in grain speculation. The County People's Court has sentenced Cheng Qiuhua, the principal culprit of this group, to six years of imprisonment according to law. Other criminals, including Tan Xinhua, Tan Wenfu, and Long Chunquan, were also sentenced to five or four years of imprisonment respectively, depending on the severity of their crimes.

These criminals, during the spring and summer lean season this year, took advantage of the grain shortage among some needy households in certain areas. They used methods such as altering, replacing, and trading grain purchase certificates to illegally purchase grain from state grain departments. They then resold it to grain-deficient households at high prices on the black market for exploitation, disrupting the stability of the state grain market. The four criminals, Cheng Qiuhua and others, were all wealthy households from Shijiawan Township, Ningxiang County. Under the guise of operating a boat, they illegally purchased more than 23,000 jin of rice from places like Linzikou in Xiangyin County at a price of ten to eleven yuan per hundred jin. They then transported it to the riverbanks of Jiulongmiao and Shejiatan in Wangcheng County, where they sold it at a black market price of fifteen to sixteen yuan per hundred jin, making a huge profit of more than 600 yuan. Relevant departments in Ningxiang County investigated their criminal activities based on reports from the masses and, after obtaining conclusive evidence, arrested them according to law.

    不许做粮食投机买卖！
    宁乡套购粮食的罪犯已依法判刑
    新华社长沙2日电　湖南省宁乡县最近破获了一个做粮食投机买卖的罪犯集团。县人民法院已依法将这个集团的主犯成秋华判处六年有期徒刑，其他罪犯谭新华、谭文富、龙春泉等也按情节轻重分别判处五年或四年有期徒刑。
    这些罪犯在今年青黄不接的春夏荒时期，利用有些地方部分困难户缺粮的机会，采取涂改、拆换和买卖购粮证的办法，向国家粮食部门套购粮食，以黑市高价转卖给缺粮户进行剥削，破坏国家粮食市场的稳定。罪犯成秋华等四人都是宁乡县石家湾乡的富裕户，他们以驾船为掩护，先后在湘阴县临资口等地以每百斤大米十到十一元的价格，套购了大米二万三千多斤，随即运往望城县的九龙庙、蛇家滩等地河岸上，以每百斤十五到十六元的黑市高价出售，获得暴利六百多元。宁乡县有关部门根据群众检举对他们的犯罪活动进行了侦查，在获得确凿罪证后依法将他们逮捕。
