　　Prince Souvanna Phouma Forms New Cabinet
　　By Our Staff Commentator

On August 9, the Lao National Assembly approved the new cabinet organized by Prince Souvanna Phouma. This marks the end of the Lao cabinet crisis, which lasted for more than two months. This is a happy event for the Lao people and something that all peace-loving countries and people in Asia are willing to see.

Prince Souvanna Phouma resigned as prime minister on May 30. Since then, the political situation in Laos has been unstable. Katay Don Sasorith and others tried to form a cabinet three times, but all failed. The United States and its agents took advantage of this opportunity to carry out activities aimed at supporting their confidants to seize power. Lao political figures have revealed that during the cabinet crisis, the U.S. Ambassador to Laos, Parsons, disregarded basic diplomatic rules and attended a meeting held at the home of a Lao cabinet minister, directly plotting the formation of the new Lao cabinet. On June 13, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robertson openly slandered and opposed the Lao people's urgent demand for the establishment of a coalition government, crudely interfering in the Lao situation. At the same time, the United States also engaged in despicable activities in southern Laos, attempting to split Lower Laos from Laos. All these activities by the United States were aimed at preventing Laos from continuing on the path of peace and neutrality and realizing national unity. However, the Lao situation did not develop according to the blueprint of the U.S. State Department after all. The re-formation of the cabinet by Prince Souvanna Phouma reflects another failure of U.S. interference.

In his speech to the National Assembly requesting authorization to form a cabinet, Prince Souvanna Phouma said that he still believes that restoring the unity of the Kingdom of Laos by resolving the issue of the Lao fighting forces is the most urgent task of the country. In order to solve this problem, both parties must strictly and faithfully abide by the agreements signed by the Royal Government and the Lao fighting forces, especially the agreement on the establishment of a coalition government signed on December 28, 1956. He also announced that a government with the participation of the Lao fighting forces might be formed around October 1. In terms of foreign policy, Prince Souvanna Phouma reiterated that Laos will pursue a policy of peace and neutrality and abide by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. It can be seen that the new Phouma cabinet is committed to implementing the basic policies of the previous Phouma cabinet, and these policies have proven to be supported by the Lao people. We believe that as long as the Royal Government of Laos and the Lao fighting forces continue to negotiate sincerely on the basis of the agreements already reached, the prospects for the peaceful unification of Laos are bright; as long as the Lao people are united in opposing foreign imperialist interference and aggression, the prospects for the peaceful independence of Laos are also bright.

Prince Souvanna Phouma led a delegation of the Lao government to visit our country in August 1956 and is a friend familiar to our government and people. That visit greatly deepened the friendship between the two peoples and left a deep impression on the Chinese people. We hope that on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and inspired by the traditional friendship between our two peoples, the friendly relations between our two countries will continue to develop.

    富马亲王重新组阁
    本报评论员
    8月9日，老挝国民议会批准了梭发那·富马亲王组织的新内阁。这样，历时两个多月的老挝内阁危机终于宣告结束了。这是老挝人民所高兴的事情，也是亚洲一切爱好和平的国家和人民所愿意看到的事情。
    富马亲王是在5月30日辞去首相职务的。从那时以后，老挝的政治局势一直是不稳定的。卡代·萨索里特等人曾三次组阁，但是都没有成功。而美国和它的代理人就利用这种时机大肆活动，企图支持美国的亲信掌握政权。老挝政界人士曾经揭露，在内阁危机期间，美国驻老挝大使帕森斯竟不顾起码的外交规则，参加在一位老挝内阁部长家里举行的会议，直接策划老挝新阁的组成。6月13日，美国助理国务卿罗伯逊更公开污蔑和反对老挝人民关于成立联合政府的迫切要求，粗暴地干涉老挝局势。同时，美国还在老挝南部进行卑鄙活动，想把下寮地区从老挝分裂出去。美国的所有这些活动，都是为了阻挠老挝继续走上和平中立的道路和实现国家的统一。但是，老挝局势毕竟不是按照美国国务院的蓝图发展的。富马亲王的重新组阁，反映了美国干涉活动的又一次失败。
    富马亲王在国民议会会议上发表要求授权组阁的演说时说，他仍然认为，用解决寮国战斗部队问题的办法来恢复老挝王国的统一，是全国头一号的迫切任务。而为了使这个问题得到解决，只有双方严格而忠实地遵守王国政府和寮国战斗部队所签订的协定，特别是在1956年12月28日签订的关于成立联合政府的协议。他并且宣布，有寮国战斗部队参加的政府可能在10月1日前后组成。在对外政策方面，富马亲王重申老挝将奉行和平中立政策，遵守和平共处五项原则。由此可见，富马新阁是坚持实行上一届富马内阁的基本政策的，而这些政策已经证明是得到老挝人民的支持的。我们相信，只要老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队双方在已经取得的协议的基础上，继续真诚协商，老挝的和平统一的前途是光明的；只要老挝人民团结一致，反对外国帝国主义的干涉和侵略，老挝的和平独立的前途也是光明的。
    富马亲王曾于1956年8月率领老挝政府代表团访问我国，是我国政府和人民所熟悉的朋友。那次访问大大加深了两国人民之间的友谊，在我国人民中间留下了深刻的记忆。我们希望，在和平共处五项原则的基础上，在我们两国人民传统友谊的鼓舞下，我们两国之间的友好关系将得到不断的发展。
