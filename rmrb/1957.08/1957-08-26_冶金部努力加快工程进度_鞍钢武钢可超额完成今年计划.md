The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry is actively taking measures to strive to complete the 1957 capital construction plan.

The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry's 1957 capital construction plan only completed 31.5% of the total investment in the first half of the year, of which the construction and installation workload only completed 32.7% of the annual plan. This is the worst year in the past three years for the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry in terms of completing the plan in the first half of the year. Among the key projects, thirty-six were originally scheduled to be completed in the first half of the year, but only sixteen were actually completed, and eight of them were not completed on schedule.

After discovering this serious situation in June, the leadership of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry conducted a comprehensive analysis and study of the implementation of the plan in the first half of the year. The inspection revealed that the main reasons affecting the progress of capital construction this year were twofold: First, there was a relatively widespread relaxation of effort from top to bottom. Initially, the ministry and bureaus did not pay close enough attention. After appropriately decentralizing some powers at the beginning of the year, they did not have a good grasp of the progress of plan completion and the dynamics of key projects for a relatively long period, and many problems below were not discovered and resolved in a timely manner. After some work systems between construction units and construction companies were changed, they were not well coordinated. Second, according to the central government's policy of "building the country with diligence and thrift," the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry once mobilized all design forces in the first and second quarters to re-examine the standards, structures, technological processes, and construction plans for industrial and civil construction, and revised the designs. According to statistics, the design modifications alone can save more than 30 million yuan in investment this year. However, in the process of changing the design, insufficient attention was paid to the progress of construction, and strict control of the design modification time was relaxed, which seriously affected the progress of the project.

In response to the above situation, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry held several ministerial meetings in June and July to conduct a detailed study on how to ensure the completion of this year's capital construction plan, and successively adopted a series of improvement measures.

They first conducted a detailed balance of the annual capital construction plan, clarifying the key to completing this year's capital construction plan: First, the design plans for many projects were determined relatively late, and there was a contradiction between the drawing delivery time not meeting the needs; second, the construction tasks in the second half of the year are very heavy, and it is necessary to complete two-thirds of the annual plan, especially to complete a large number of key projects. In response to this situation, the delivery time of construction drawings for the projects to be constructed in the second half of the year was determined item by item according to the needs of the construction and the possibilities of the design department, and the design bureau was ordered to strictly check and supervise. Given that the key to whether the plan can be completed in the end lies in the active efforts of the construction department, the ministerial meeting ordered the Construction Bureau to draw two-thirds of its strength to specifically organize and supervise the completion of the construction tasks undertaken this year. At the same time, the managers of both parties, Anshan Iron and Steel and Wuhan Iron and Steel, were also called to the ministry to specifically discuss measures to ensure the completion of this year's capital construction plan.

In addition to issuing notices and circulars to its affiliated units to ensure the completion of this year's capital construction plan, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry also issued specific instructions to key units. The relevant departments and bureaus also organized nine joint inspection teams, a total of more than 120 people, to go to nine regions including Northeast, Central South, Northwest, and East China in July to help and promote the work of relevant units in these regions.

The ministry has established a capital construction balance meeting system to regularly check the implementation of the plan, study and solve major problems in capital construction. At the same time, a joint office was established to ensure the completion of the annual plan, and the responsible persons of the relevant departments and bureaus were designated to participate, concentrating on working three days a week to jointly solve problems that cannot be solved by one department or one bureau. In order to timely grasp the implementation of the plan by grassroots units and facilitate timely resolution of problems, the dispatch telephone system for key units was restored.

In order to ensure the completion of the total capital construction investment in 1957, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry also approved the addition of a batch of projects that are necessary for 1958 and have construction conditions this year. This is because some projects this year cannot be completed this year due to changes in construction conditions; at the same time, a considerable part of the investment has been saved this year. Now these additional tasks have been issued to the construction units.

At present, some units affiliated to the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry have actively taken action. Anshan Iron and Steel Company, Anshan Metallurgical Construction Corporation, Black Metallurgical Mining Design Institute, and Anshan Branch of Black Metallurgical Design Institute have made emergency mobilizations to their employees, and the morale of the vast number of employees is very high. According to the preliminary calculations of both parties, Anshan Iron and Steel can overfulfill the original annual plan by more than 12%. Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, Baiyin Plant, Nonferrous Metals Company and other units, after preliminary research by both parties, also believe that they can overfulfill this year's capital construction plan.

### 冶金部努力加快工程进度　鞍钢武钢可超额完成今年计划

    冶金部努力加快工程进度
　　鞍钢武钢可超额完成今年计划
    本报讯　冶金工业部积极采取措施，争取完成1957年基本建设计划。
    冶金工业部1957年的基本建设计划，上半年只完成了投资总额的31.5％，其中建筑安装工作量只完成年计划的32.7％。这是冶金工业部最近三年来上半年完成计划最不好的一年。重点工程项目中，原计划上半年竣工的有三十六项，实际完成的也只有十六项，其中还有八项没有按期完成。
    冶金工业部领导方面在6月间发现这一严重情况以后，随即将上半年计划执行情况进行了全面的分析研究。检查中发现，影响今年基本建设进度的主要原因有二：第一，从上到下比较普遍地存在着松劲思想。首先是部、局抓得不紧，在年初适当下放一些权限以后，有较长的一段时间，没有将各地完成计划的情况和重点工程的动态很好地掌握起来，下面有不少问题没有及时发现和解决。建设单位和施工单位之间的一些工作制度改变以后，也没有很好地衔接起来。第二，冶金工业部根据中央“勤俭建国”的方针，曾经在一、二季度发动全部设计力量，对工业、民用建设的标准、结构、工艺过程和建设方案重新进行了审查，并且修改了设计。据统计，仅修改设计一项即能在本年度内节约投资三千多万元。但是在变更设计过程中，对建设进度注意不够，放松了对设计修改时间的严格控制，以致比较严重地影响了工程进度。
    针对以上情况，冶金工业部在6、7月份召开了多次部务会议，对如何保证完成今年的基本建设计划作了详尽的研究，并且相继采取了一系列的改进措施。
    他们首先对全年的基本建设计划进行了细致的平衡，摸清了完成今年基建计划的关键：首先是，很多项目设计方案确定得较晚，存在着交图时间赶不上需要的矛盾；其次是，下半年的建设任务十分繁重，必须完成占全年计划三分之二的任务，特别是要完成大批重点工程项目。针对这种情况，对下半年交图施工的工程，都根据施工的需要和设计部门的可能，逐项确定了施工图的交付时间，并责成设计局严格进行检查督促。鉴于最后能否完成计划的关键在于施工部门的积极努力，部务会议责成建筑局抽出三分之二的力量专门负责组织和督促完成今年承建的施工任务。同时，还召集鞍钢、武钢的甲、乙双方经理到部里具体商讨了如何保证完成今年基建计划的措施。
    除向所属单位颁发了保证完成今年基本建设计划的通知和通报以外，冶金部还对重点单位下达了具体指示。各有关司、局也组织了九个联合检查组，共一百二十余人，在7月份分别到东北、中南、西北、华东等九个地区，帮助和推动这些地区的有关单位开展工作。
    部里建立了基建平衡会议制度，定期检查计划执行情况，研究和解决基本建设中的重大问题。同时成立了保证完成年度计划的联合办公室，有关各司、局都指定负责人参加，每周集中办公三天，共同解决一司、一局不能解决的问题。为了及时掌握基层单位的计划执行情况和便于及时解决问题，恢复了对重点单位的调度电话制度。
    为了保证1957年基建投资总额的完成，冶金工业部还批准追加了一批1958年所必需的、今年又有建设条件的工程。这是因为今年有一部分工程由于建设条件的变化，的确无法在今年内完成；同时，今年还节约了相当大的一部分投资。现在这些追加的任务，已经下达到建设单位。
    目前，冶金工业部所属单位有的已经积极行动起来。鞍山钢铁公司、鞍山冶金建设总公司、黑色冶金矿山设计院、黑色冶金设计院鞍山分院等单位，已经向职工们作了紧急动员，广大职工情绪十分高涨。据鞍钢甲、乙双方的初步计算，他们可以超额12％以上完成原年度计划。武汉钢铁公司、白银厂、有色金属公司等单位，经过甲、乙双方初步研究，也认为可以超额完成今年的基建计划。
