Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 5th: The Chinese golden dragon's soaring and tumbling on the stage of the Hall of Columns of the Moscow Trade Union Palace on the afternoon of August 3rd brought the emotions of the audience here to a climax. They accompanied the Chinese golden dragon's dance on stage with ten minutes of non-stop applause and cheers. The hearts of these strict connoisseurs were deeply touched by the art of the Chinese youth.

    The hall was pitch black, and the audience saw a layer of gently floating clouds. No actors were visible, only a golden, shimmering dragon about eighty feet long dancing and flying in the clouds. The sound of the low-pitched suona was like the wind howling and the sea roaring. The golden dragon traveled left and right, chasing the red pearl, sometimes coiling up the vermilion pillar, arching its back to hold the red pearl. Suddenly, the red pearl slipped off the dragon's back, and the golden dragon became anxious, flying out like an arrow. The howling of the wind became more intense, and it swam faster and faster, and the audience's emotions became even more excited. In the end, the golden dragon attracted a mother dragon. When the two dragons played with the pearl, the audience couldn't help but stand up and cheer loudly. Before the program ended, the Chinese audience offstage was surrounded. Audiences from various countries sincerely congratulated and thanked them.

    An old lady said to a young Chinese man that this vigorous, majestic, and kind golden dragon vividly expressed the honest and great national spirit of the Chinese people.

    Another old lady, unable to find a better souvenir around her, gave a Moscow matchbox to a Chinese girl next to her to express her congratulations.

    Backstage, the actors were thrown into the sky by the audience, and the girls were pulled into dancing together.

    The audience was intoxicated by the Chinese dances.

    Azerbaijani Honored Artist Yegorov said that Chinese dance art is brilliant and rich. The Peacock Dance is full of the most intense poetry, and the Dragon Dance gives a feeling of youthful vitality. These are two completely different kinds of dances, but people have received the greatest artistic enjoyment from them.

    The famous ballet dancer Yevgenia Borisovna is particularly interested in Chinese dance. She comes to see it every time and inquires about what programs China has in the next competition. (Attached picture)

    金龙飞舞轰动联欢节
    中国青年的艺术博得热烈喝采
    据新华社莫斯科5日电　中国的金龙8月3日下午在莫斯科工会大厦圆柱大厅的舞台上飞腾翻滚把这里观众的情绪引到了一个顶峰。他们以十分钟的不停的掌声和喝采声伴随着舞台上中国金龙的飞舞。这些严格的欣赏家们的心被中国青年的艺术深深打动了。
    大厅内漆黑一片，观众眼前是一片轻轻飘浮着的云层，见不到一个演员，只见一条长约八丈、金光闪烁的蛟龙在云中翻腾飞舞。低音唢呐的声音像风在呼，海在啸。金龙忽左忽右地游行，追逐着红珠，一会儿盘着朱柱而上，用背拱着红珠，忽然红珠从龙背上滑了下来，金龙着了急，疾如飞箭地飞了出去。风的呼啸声愈烈，它游得愈快，观众的情绪也就愈加兴奋激动。到最后，金龙引来了一条母龙。在二龙戏珠的时候，观众已经忍不住地站立起来，大声喝采。节目还未结束，台下的中国观众就纷纷被包围。各国观众衷心地向他们祝贺道谢。
    一位老太太对一位中国青年说，这条充满活力、威武无比而又善良的金龙生动地表现了中国人民淳厚伟大的民族气魄。
    另一位老太太在身边找不出更好的纪念品，把一个莫斯科的火柴盒送给了她旁边的一位中国姑娘，以表示祝贺。
    在后台，演员们被观众抛上了天空，姑娘们被拉着一同跳舞。
    观众对中国的舞蹈感到陶醉。
    阿塞拜疆功勋艺术家叶戈罗夫说，中国的舞蹈艺术是灿烂丰富的。孔雀舞富有最浓厚的诗意，龙舞给人以青春活力的感觉。这是两种完全不同性质的舞蹈，但是人们从里面都得到了艺术最大的享受。
    著名的巴蕾舞演员叶夫根尼亚·鲍里索芙娜对中国舞蹈特别感兴趣，她每次都来看，并且打听下一次比赛中国有那些节目。（附图片）
