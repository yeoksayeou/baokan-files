Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 11th—The seven design institutes in Shenyang affiliated with the central ministries have launched a struggle against the bourgeois rightists. Currently, the arrogance of the rightists has been suppressed, and they are becoming increasingly isolated. Some rightist elements have begun to bow their heads to the people, confess their guilt, and provide materials.

	The Shenyang Design Institute of the Electrical Machinery Manufacturing Industry Ministry uncovered a right-wing clique with five engineering technicians as its core. The head of this clique, engineer Zhang Xibo, declared that the rectification campaign was a great opportunity for "revenge for grievances and settling scores." This group of rightists had drafted a program against the Party and socialism. They hated cadres of worker and peasant origin, advocated that worker and peasant cadres should withdraw from the design institute, and wanted to abolish the security section. Zhang Xibo also openly advocated electing a president and demanded that everyone discuss the system of the design institute so that it could be subverted or reorganized according to their intentions, fundamentally severing the design institute from the leadership of the Communist Party. Mo Duanrui, a technician and rightist element at the Shenyang Branch of the Non-Ferrous Metallurgical Design Institute of the Metallurgical Industry Ministry, distorted the meaning of Marxist-Leninist books, piecing together a set of "theories" to attack the Communist Party. He deliberately misrepresented, saying, "After the Chinese proletariat has seized power and the bourgeoisie has been eliminated, the state should disappear." He advocated establishing a workers' committee (with no Communist Party members allowed to be members) to seize the Party's leadership. Huang Wuyan, an assistant engineer and rightist element at the Shenyang Coal Mine Design Institute of the Coal Industry Ministry, divided Communist Party members and non-Party members into "two classes." He maliciously incited, saying, "It's better to be a slave of a foreign power now, because slaves of a foreign power are all one class, and there is a glimmer of hope." Geng Ning, an engineer and rightist element at the Third Design Bureau of the Design General Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building, slandered, "There is no rule of law now," and that the Communist Party and the People's Government are "lawless."

	These design units' rightists made a big issue of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries during the great blooming and contending. Some counter-revolutionaries also took the opportunity to shout "injustice." Zhao Qian, an engineer at the Northeast Industrial Architectural Design Institute of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, was originally a historical counter-revolutionary. He took advantage of the great blooming and contending to attempt to overturn the organization's historical conclusion about him. After the organization of this design institute explained to the masses many of Zhao Qian's past counter-revolutionary facts, the engineering technicians were extremely angry about Zhao Qian's counter-revolutionary crimes, believing that the government's handling of him was too lenient, and demanded that the government re-evaluate the case.

	The rightists' destruction of the Communist Party and socialist cause was all-pervasive. In the Shenyang Coal Mine Design Institute, half of the employees were from the south. Chen Tinghong, a technician and rightist element, took advantage of the fact that these employees were not used to life in the Northeast and seized the opportunity to attack the state system as cold and the Communist Party as ruthless. During the blooming and contending, he not only incited in the design institute but also ran to the Northeast Geological Bureau of the Ministry of Geology, Fushun, and other places to instigate southern employees to propose that all southerners take three days of leave to express their petition and mobilized family members to write letters to put pressure on the government and create chaos.

	This group of rightist elements stirred up trouble with insidious and vicious means after the rectification campaign began. In some right-wing cliques, they were organized and divided their labor, with some igniting fires everywhere, some writing big-character posters and wall newspapers, and some specializing in collecting various materials for distortion and spreading reactionary remarks. Some rightist elements also adopted methods such as "praising, coaxing, deceiving, and satirizing" to provoke the masses and isolate the leadership.

	The rightist elements who have been exposed in these design units are all dissatisfied with the Communist Party and socialism. Some have complex political histories, and some adhere to the reactionary stance of the exploiting classes. According to preliminary statistics, among the rightist elements in these design units, those whose family origin is landlord, rich peasant, or capitalist account for 67%, and those who themselves were objects of suppression of counter-revolutionaries or whose family members were struggled against or suppressed account for 78%.

	After the start of the anti-rightist struggle, the engineering technicians in each design unit enthusiastically expressed their desire to expose all rightist elements. In recent days, they have persisted in work and actively participated in meetings, writing big-character posters and wall newspapers to expose and criticize the reactionary remarks of the rightist elements, making it impossible for the rightist elements to hide and forcing them to bow their heads and confess their crimes.

    一面坚持工作　一面积极斗争
    沈阳七个设计院获初步胜利
    新华社沈阳11日电  中央各部所属在沈阳的七个设计院，已经展开反对资产阶级右派的斗争。目前右派分子的气焰已经打落，一个个陷入孤立。有些右派分子开始向人民低头认罪，交代材料。
      电机制造工业部沈阳设计院职工揭发出了以五个工程技术人员为骨干的右派小集团。这个小集团的头子、工程师章希博宣称：整风是“有仇报仇，有冤报冤”的大好时机。这批右派分子曾拟订了一个反党、反社会主义的纲领。他们仇恨工农出身的干部，主张工农干部退出设计院，并要取消保卫科。章希博还公开主张选举院长，并且要求大家讨论设计院的体制，以便按照他们的意图搞垮或改组设计院，使设计院根本上脱离共产党的领导。冶金工业部有色冶金设计总院沈阳分院的右派分子、技术员莫端瑞，从马列主义书籍中断章取义，整理出一套
  “理论”，来向共产党进攻。他有意歪曲说：“我国无产阶级掌握了政权，资产阶级消灭以后，国家应该灭亡了。”他主张成立工人委员会（不许共产党员当委员），以夺取党的领导权。煤炭工业部沈阳煤矿设计院右派分子、助理工程师黄武炎，把共产党员和非党人士分为“两个阶级”，他恶意挑拨说：“现在还不如当亡国奴，因为亡国奴都是一个阶级，还有一线光明。”第一机械工业部设计总局第三设计分局右派分子、工程师耿宁诬蔑“现在没有法制”，共产党、人民政府“无法无天”。
    这些设计单位的右派分子在大鸣大放中都抓住肃反问题大做文章。有的反革命分子并且趁机喊“冤”叫“屈”。建筑工程部东北工业建筑设计院工程师赵谦原来是一个历史反革命分子，他利用大鸣大放机会企图推翻组织上对他作的历史结论。这个设计院的组织上向群众讲清了赵谦过去的许多反革命事实以后，工程技术人员们都对赵谦的反革命罪行愤慨异常，认为政府对他处理太宽大了，纷纷要求政府重新处理。
    右派分子对共产党、对社会主义事业的破坏，是无孔不入的。沈阳煤矿设计院职工中，有二分之一是南方人。右派分子、技术员陈庭洪利用这些职工在东北生活有些不习惯的空子，便乘机攻击国家制度冷酷、共产党无情。鸣、放中，他不仅在设计院，还跑到地质部东北地质局、抚顺等处煽动南方职工，提出要全体南方人请假三天表示请愿，并且发动家属写信，以便给政府压力，造成混乱。
    这批右派分子在整风开始以后，就兴风作浪，手段阴险毒辣。在某些右派分子小集团里，他们有组织有分工，有的到处点火，有的写大字报、墙报，有的专门收集各种材料以备歪曲，散布反动言行。有些右派分子还采取“捧、哄、骗、讽”等手段，来挑拨群众、孤立领导。
    这些设计单位已经揭发的右派分子，都是对共产党和社会主义心怀不满的，他们有的政治历史复杂，有的坚持剥削阶级的反动立场。据初步统计，这些设计单位的右派分子中家庭出身是地主、富农、资本家的占67％，本人是肃反对象，家庭成员被斗、被镇压者占78％。
    在反右派斗争开始以后，各设计单位的工程技术人员，都热烈表示要揭发出所有右派分子。连日来，他们一面坚持工作，一面积极地参加会议、写大字报、墙报等，揭发和批判右派分子的反动言行，使右派分子无法隐藏，不得不低头认罪。
