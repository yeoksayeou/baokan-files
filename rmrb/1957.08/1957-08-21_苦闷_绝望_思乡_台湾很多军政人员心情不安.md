Xinhua News Agency, August 20th: The low morale of many Kuomintang personnel in Taiwan has recently seen significant development. Taiwanese newspapers reveal that people sent from Taiwan to Europe and the United States over the past few months, upon returning to Taiwan, have indicated that the situation is becoming increasingly unfavorable to Taiwan, adding to the heavy hearts of high-ranking Kuomintang military and government personnel.

Kuomintang middle and lower-ranking military and government personnel are even more depressed due to the continuous rise in prices in Taiwan, the lack of long-term salary adjustments, and the hardship in their material lives. A Taiwanese "provincial assemblyman" recently spoke sarcastically, saying that the Kuomintang Taiwan Provincial Government might as well rename the various departments according to clothing, food, housing and transportation, such as the "Eating Department," the "Clothing Department," etc., to solve the difficulties of the staff.

Taiwanese newspapers say that the current psychological state of Kuomintang personnel in Taiwan is a "perverted psychology intertwined with anguish and despair," and "worry" has become a prevalent disease in Taiwan's officialdom. Many people are unwilling to mention wild talk like "counterattacking the mainland" anymore, and instead focus on health secrets and the like. Many who have spent all their savings worry that they won't even have a coffin after they die. For example, recently the Kuomintang "National Assembly Representatives Association" requested the Taiwan Central Trust Bureau to handle "group life insurance" so that all "National Assembly Representatives" can participate in insurance, to avoid having no money for burial after death and their families becoming starving ghosts.

The homesickness of many Kuomintang personnel in Taiwan is also growing day by day. Once, at a dinner party of a group in Taipei, someone cried bitterly for their hometown after getting drunk, causing more than three hundred people present to cry together. Some people often climb mountains to look into the distance, considering it "reminiscing about the scenery of the mainland." At a symposium held by a magazine in Taiwan, many people said: "As long as we can return to the mainland, we can die in peace." Many Kuomintang personnel know that their desire to return to the mainland and restore their rule through war is a fantasy. Recently, the Taiwan "Free China" bi-weekly magazine greatly satirized the so-called "counterattack the mainland," saying that judging from conditions such as population, resources, and scientific standards, "counterattacking the mainland" is really a "self-deceiving" "official jargon" of the Taiwan Kuomintang authorities, which "makes everyone feel more and more empty, and makes everyone feel more and more confused." The magazine also said: Taiwan's "current situation is really too depressing," and everywhere is "complaint, regret, pessimism, disappointment, and bewilderment."

### 苦闷·绝望·思乡　台湾很多军政人员心情不安

　　苦闷·绝望·思乡
　　台湾很多军政人员心情不安
    新华社20日讯　台湾很多国民党人员低落的情绪，最近有很大发展。台湾报纸透露，几个月来由台湾派往欧美各地活动的人，返台湾后都指出局势对台湾愈来愈不利，增加了国民党高级军政人员心情的沉重。
    国民党中下级军政人员，由于台湾物价不断上涨，待遇长期没有调整，物质生活困苦，精神更为颓丧。一个台湾“省议员”最近发言嘲讽说，国民党台湾省政府不如按照衣食住行，把各厅改为“吃饭厅”、“穿衣厅”等，以解决工作人员的困苦。
    台湾报纸说，目前台湾国民党人员的心理状态是“苦闷和绝望交织的变态心理”，“烦恼”已经成为台湾官场中的流行病。许多人都不愿再提“反攻大陆”之类的妄言了，而专门讲求养生秘诀之类的玩意。许多积蓄已经花光的人，则担心自己死后连棺材都没有。如最近国民党“国大代表联谊会”要求台湾中央信托局办理“团体寿险”，让全体“国大代表”都能参加保险，以免死后无以为殓和家属成为饿殍。
    台湾很多国民党人员思乡的心情也日益增长。有一次在台北一个团体的聚餐会上，有人酒醉思乡痛哭，当场引起到会的三百多人都大哭起来。有些人经常登山远望，算是“追怀大陆风光”。在台湾一家杂志举行的座谈会上，许多人说：“只要能回大陆，死也瞑目”。许多国民党人员知道，他们想通过战争途径重返大陆复辟，实为妄想。最近，台湾“自由中国”半月刊对所谓“反攻大陆”的说法就大加讽刺，说从人口、资源、科学水准等条件来衡量，“反攻大陆”实在是台湾国民党当局“自欺欺人”的“一派官腔”，它“愈来愈使大家感到空虚，愈来愈使大家感到迷茫”。这家刊物还说：台湾“目前的局面真是太沉闷了”，到处是“牢骚、怅惘、悲观、失望、徬徨。”
