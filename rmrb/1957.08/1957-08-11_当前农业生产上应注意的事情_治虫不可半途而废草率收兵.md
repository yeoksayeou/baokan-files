Matters Needing Attention in Current Agricultural Production
Pest Control Must Not Be Abandoned Halfway and Hastily Concluded

Many situations show that a paralyzing mindset is growing again in many areas regarding the prevention and control of crop pests. Some comrades are satisfied with the achievements already made in pest control and no longer take pest control work to heart.

It is true that summer locusts have been eradicated in a considerable area, and certain results have been achieved in many areas in the prevention and control of cotton aphids, corn borers, and rice stem borers. However, this is only one round in our fight against pests. The occurrence of pests is wave upon wave. As the seasons change, some pests are eliminated, and another pest will follow. It was not long ago that Hebei, Shandong, and other places fought summer locusts; however, autumn locusts have now occurred in these places. The area of autumn locusts in Hebei is more than 2.74 million mu, and the area in the Liaocheng area of Shandong is more than 1 million mu, which is no less than the summer locusts. The harm of the first generation of corn borers and armyworms has passed; however, the second generation of corn borers and armyworms has already occurred. Provinces such as Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Hebei, and Liaoning have generally found the second generation of corn borers. The second generation of armyworms in Shanxi, Hebei, and Shandong has begun to harm millet. According to forecasts in some southern regions, rice stem borers are harming late rice in the paddy fields. There are now more than ten kinds of major late-stage cotton pests that have been discovered. Pink bollworm is now quite widespread, and cotton bollworm is quite serious in the northern cotton areas. In the face of these facts, how can we relax pest control work?

Some people also believe that although there are insects now, the damage is not great. The actual situation is not like this. Autumn locusts grow rapidly and spread much faster than summer locusts. Judging from the occurrence this year, if prevention and control are not effective, there is a risk of taking flight in mid-August. The second generation of corn borers and armyworms threatens hundreds of millions of mu of summer-sown grain crops. Large areas of late rice in the southern region are the target of rice stem borers. If pink bollworm, cotton bollworm, and other pests are severely harmful, even if the early growth of cotton plants is good, yields will be reduced or even lost. In general, the degree of harm to crops by the pests now in full bloom is no less than that of many pests in the early stage.

Now, the summer-sown corn and millet in the northern region have entered the vigorous growth period and are about to tassel and bear fruit; the cotton fields in the south and north are generally flowering and forming bolls. How much manpower and material resources have been spent on such good crops! At the time when it is about to be harvested, how can we let the insects take away the fruits of labor! If it suffers from insect pests early, the season is still early, and it is relatively easy to remedy; now if it suffers from serious insect pests again, it will be difficult to remedy. In these respects, the current work of preventing and controlling insect pests is more important than the previous stage.

This summer, many areas have suffered from floods and droughts, and some areas are busy with flood and drought prevention, while relaxing the prevention and control of insect pests. It should be understood that drought and flood can reduce or lose our crops, and insect pests have the same destructive ability. In 1954, the provinces of Hunan, Guangxi, Fujian, and Anhui lost 900 million jin of rice due to severe rice stem borers. Experience tells us that only by comprehensively overcoming natural disasters can we have a reliable guarantee of a good harvest; grasping one aspect and relaxing another will make agricultural production escape a knife but suffer a gun.

    当前农业生产上应注意的事情
    治虫不可半途而废草率收兵
    许多情况表明，不少地区在防治农作物虫害工作上又滋长起来一种麻痹思想。有些同志满足于防治虫害工作已经得到的成就，不再把治虫工作放在心上了。
    不错，相当大地区的夏蝗已经被我们扑灭了，许多地区在防治棉蚜、玉米螟、稻螟虫等方面都收到一定的效果。但是，这只是我们和虫害斗争的一个回合。害虫的发生是彼伏此起的。随着季节的变化，一些害虫被消灭了，另一种害虫又会接踵而至。河北、山东等地扑打夏蝗，是不久以前的事；可是，现在这些地方的秋蝗又发生了。河北秋蝗发生的面积有二百七十四万多亩，山东聊城专区发生的面积有一百多万亩，都不比夏蝗少。第一代玉米螟和粘虫的为害过去了；可是，第二代玉米螟、粘虫却已发生。普遍发现第二代玉米螟的地区，有河南、山东、山西、陕西、河北、辽宁等省。山西、河北、山东的第二代粘虫已经开始为害谷子。根据南方一些地区的预测，三化螟正在为害晚稻本田。现在已发现的棉花主要后期害虫不下十多种。棉红铃虫现在为害相当普遍，棉铃虫在北方棉区相当严重。在这些事实面前，怎么能放松治虫工作呢？
    也有人认为，现在虽然有虫子，但是为害不大了。实际情况不是这样。秋蝗生长迅速，扩散能力比夏蝗快的多。从今年的发生情况看，如果防治不力，8月中就有起飞的危险。第二代玉米螟、粘虫，威胁着上亿亩的夏播谷类作物。南方地区大面积晚稻，正是三化螟的为害对象。如果红铃虫、棉铃虫等为害严重，棉株前期生长得再好，也会减产甚至失收。总起来说，现在盛发的害虫对农作物的为害程度，是不小于前期许多害虫的。
    现在，北方地区的夏播玉米、谷子都进入生长旺期，眼看就要抽穗结实；南方北方的棉田普遍在开花结铃。大好的庄稼，已经花费了多少人力、物力！在快要收获的时候，怎能让虫子把劳动果实夺去！早期万一受了虫害，季节尚早，还比较容易补救；现在再受严重虫害，要补救也很难了。从这些方面来说，当前的防治害虫工作比前一阶段还要重要。
    今年夏季，不少地区发生水旱灾害，有些地区忙于防水、防旱，而放松了防治害虫。应当了解：旱涝可以使我们的庄稼减产、失收，虫害也具有同样的破坏能力。1954年湖南、广西、福建、安徽几省就因为螟害严重而损失了九亿斤稻谷。经验告诉我们：只有全面战胜自然灾害，丰收才有可靠的保证；抓紧一面放松一面，就会使农业生产虽然躲过一刀却挨上一枪。
