    Korean People Welcome the First Five-Year Plan
    By Our Correspondent Wang Yuzhang
    The people of North Korea, having victoriously overfulfilled the Three-Year Plan for the postwar rehabilitation and development of the people's economy, have begun their first Five-Year Plan this year.
    During the Three-Year Plan, the Korean people rapidly restored their industrial and agricultural production, which had been severely damaged during the war, and achieved brilliant success. Last year, the total industrial output value reached 1.8 times that of 1949 before the war, grain production exceeded that of 1949 by 8%, and the people's living standards improved significantly.
    On the basis of the achievements of the Three-Year Plan, the Workers' Party and the Republic government put forward the great task of the first Five-Year Plan. According to Premier Kim Il-sung's speech to voters on August 2, the basic tasks of the Five-Year Plan are: to lay the foundation for socialist industrialization, to complete agricultural cooperativization, to further consolidate the socialist economic base of North Korea, and to basically solve the people's problems of clothing, food, and housing. Upon completion of the Five-Year Plan, the Republic's industry will completely eliminate its colonial distortions and backwardness, and the Republic will be transformed from a backward agricultural country into an economically independent industrial and agricultural state. In order to accomplish this task, it is necessary to thoroughly implement the economic policy of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, while rapidly developing light industry and agriculture.
    By 1961, the end of the Five-Year Plan, the total industrial output value is to be increased to 243% of that in 1956. By then, the annual production capacity will be 600,000 tons of chemical fertilizer, 2,000,000 tons of cement, 9.5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, and 10,000,000 tons of coal. The annual production of cloth will be enough to provide each person in North Korea with 17 meters. Grain production is to reach 3,700,000 tons, completely solving the grain problem. The annual fish catch in the aquatic products industry is to reach 600,000 tons. In addition to building a large number of houses in cities, 200,000 houses are to be built in rural areas.
    In order to accomplish this massive task, the Workers' Party and the Republic government organized and launched a mass movement to discuss the Five-Year Plan. The basic tasks and prospects of the Five-Year Plan were fully explained to the masses, and the control targets of the draft Five-Year Plan were handed over to each production unit, so that each production unit and each producer could discuss and study from their own production positions how to correctly formulate the Five-Year Plan and how to ensure its completion. Relying on the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses to solve problems, overcome difficulties, and strive for maximum production increases and savings, the Five-Year Plan was transformed into a plan of the masses.
    From factory directors and engineers to every worker, all actively and enthusiastically participated in this discussion in Korean factories and mining enterprises. Party and government leaders, headed by Premier Kim Il-sung, also went to factories and mines to participate in and arrange the work of leading the discussion. Workers put forward many suggestions and opinions on improving production organization, tapping the potential for increasing production and saving costs, and improving labor productivity and equipment utilization. From June to the present, the potential unearthed by workers in factories and mines in various places has increased the total industrial output value of the Five-Year Plan by more than 45 billion won (Korean currency) compared to the draft.
    In order to fully supply the steel needed for large-scale construction and the growing machinery industry in the Five-Year Plan, the workers in the steel industry, who are the vanguards in the production increase movement, made outstanding contributions in this discussion. As a result of the discussion by the steelworkers of the Hwanghae Iron Works, by the end of the Five-Year Plan, the time to refine a furnace of steel can be shortened by two to three hours compared to the present. In addition, with the expansion of two new open-hearth furnaces in the Five-Year Plan, they will increase steel production by 100,000 tons more than the amount stipulated in the draft Five-Year Plan. The workers of the Kim Chaek Iron Works will increase the production of pig iron by more than 50,000 tons and coking coal by 100,000 tons more than the draft.
    In the discussion of representatives of workers in the western coal mines of the Republic, which was personally led by Premier Kim Il-sung, the workers supported the draft Five-Year Plan, which called for increasing coal production to 246% of that in 1956 by 1961. As a result of their discussion, they will increase coal production by more than 1.6 million tons in addition to the figure in the draft and save more than 200 million won in costs. During the discussion, the workers of the New Warehouse Coal Mine proposed to change the current handicraft coal mining methods, accelerate the speed of tunnel excavation, and mechanize the transportation system, so that the monthly output of each coal miner would increase by more than five tons compared to the draft Five-Year Plan. Some coal miners suggested in the discussion to immediately launch a high-speed tunnel excavation movement.
    Nine light industrial and handicraft enterprises in Pyongyang City, led by the Pyongyang Textile Factory, unearthed the potential to increase production by 8.8 billion won in the discussion.
    This discussion on the Five-Year Plan has not yet ended, but it has already achieved great results. From this, people can see how the Korean working people support and love the Five-Year Plan put forward by the Workers' Party and the Republic government, and are willing to work hard for its realization.
    The Korean people have already achieved great success in the first year of completing the Five-Year Plan.
    This year's total industrial output value plan is 22% higher than last year. Although there are many difficulties in terms of fuel, raw materials, funds, and building materials, the laboring people launched a movement to tap potential, increase production, and save money without increasing equipment and manpower since the beginning of the year, and have now overfulfilled the industrial output value plan for the first seven months. The plan for the first half of this year has been overfulfilled by 12%, with an increase of 19,000 tons of pig iron, 18,000 tons of steel, 23,000 tons of steel products, 250,000 tons of coal, 38,000 tons of cement, and 4.4 million meters of cotton fabrics. The value of industrial output increased by a total of 5.1 billion won in the first half of this year.
    In important factories such as the Kim Chaek Iron Works, the blast furnace's daily pig iron output has increased from 550 tons at the end of last year to more than 900 tons in July of this year due to the production increase movement and the transformation of equipment such as hot blast furnaces by the ironworkers. On July 13, it even created a record high of 1,049 tons. During this period, the daily cotton cloth output of the Pyongyang Textile Factory also increased from 180,000 meters to 240,000 meters.
    The coal industry, which failed to complete its plan last year, overfulfilled its plan by 11% in the first half of this year, supplying a large amount of raw materials to various economic sectors. Other important industrial sectors have all completed their plans.
    In terms of savings, industrial sectors saved more than 140 million kilowatt-hours of electricity, more than 50,000 tons of coal, and more than 2,000 tons of steel in the first half of the year.
    This year, the peasants put forward the goal of increasing grain production to 3.4 million tons. In the face of the rare drought this spring, the peasants repaired canals, dug wells, and vigorously fought drought, planted seedlings in 87,000 square chongbo of paddy fields lacking irrigation, completed 94% of the planned area for rice transplanting, and overfulfilled the dry land sowing plan. Now the crops are growing very luxuriantly in various places, and there is hope for a good harvest.
    The victory of the production increase and conservation movement of the Korean people in the first half of this year proves that they are fully capable of completing the economic plan for the first year of the Five-Year Plan and laying the foundation for further completion of the Five-Year Plan.

    朝鲜人民迎接第一个五年计划
    本报记者　王玉章
    胜利地超额完成了战后人民经济恢复发展三年计划的北朝鲜人民，从今年开始了第一个五年计划。
    在三年计划中，朝鲜人民把在战争中遭到严重破坏的工农业生产迅速地恢复起来，取得了光辉的成就。去年的工业总产值已达到了战前1949年的一点八倍，粮食产量超过了1949年的8％，人民生活有了显著的改善。
    在三年计划的成就的基础上，劳动党和共和国政府提出了第一个五年计划的伟大任务。根据金日成首相8月2日对选民的演说，五年计划的基本任务是：奠定社会主义工业化的基础，完成农业合作化，以进一步巩固朝鲜北部的社会主义经济基础，基本上解决人民的衣、食、住问题。完成五年计划后，将使共和国工业完全肃清殖民地的畸形和落后的情况，使共和国由落后的农业国变成为经济上独立的工业和农业国家。为了完成这一任务，就要彻底执行优先发展重工业，同时迅速发展轻工业和农业的经济政策。
    到五年计划结束时的1961年，工业总产值要增加到1956年的243％。到那时每年能够生产六十万吨化学肥料，二百万吨水泥，九十五亿瓩时电力，一千万吨煤炭。每年生产的布匹要使朝鲜北部每人能够分到十七公尺。粮食产量要达到三百七十万吨，完全解决粮食问题。水产业中每年的捕鱼量要达到六十万吨。除了在城市建设大量住宅外，还要在农村建设二十万栋住宅。
    为了完成这项庞大的任务，劳动党和共和国政府组织发动了群众性的讨论五年计划的运动。就是把五年计划的基本任务和远景充分地向群众说明，把五年计划草案的控制指标交给每个生产单位，让每个生产单位和每个生产者从自己的生产岗位上来讨论研究如何正确制订五年计划，怎样来保证完成。依靠群众的积极性和创造性来解决问题克服困难，争取最大限度的增产节约，把五年计划变成群众的计划。
    朝鲜各厂矿企业从厂长、工程师直到每个工人都积极热烈地参加了这个讨论。以金日成首相为首的党和政府的领导人也到厂矿中去参加并布置领导讨论的工作。职工们从改善生产组织，挖掘增产节约降低成本的潜力，提高劳动生产率和设备利用率方面提出了许多的建议和意见。从6月份开始到目前为止，各地厂矿职工们挖掘出的潜力使五年计划的工业总产值比草案增加了四百五十多亿元（朝币）。
    为了充分供应五年计划中大规模建设和日益增长的机械工业需用的钢材，在增产运动中打先锋的钢铁部门的职工们在这个讨论中作出了突出的贡献。黄海制铁所的炼钢工人讨论的结果，到五年计划末期可把炼一炉钢的时间比现在缩短二小时到三小时，加上在五年计划中新扩二座平炉，他们要比五年计划草案中规定的钢产量增产十万吨。金策制铁所的职工们要比草案增产五万多吨生铁和十万吨焦煤。
    在金日成首相亲自领导进行的共和国西部各煤矿职工代表的讨论中，职工们支持到1961年使煤产量提高到1956年的246％的五年计划草案，他们讨论的结果，还要在这个草案数字外增产一百六十多万吨煤，节约成本二亿多元。讨论中新仓煤矿的职工们要改变目前的手工业采煤方法，要加快坑道挖进速度，把搬运系统机械化，使每个采煤工的月采量比五年计划草案增加五吨多。有的煤矿工人在讨论中建议立即展开高速度坑道掘进运动。
    以平壤纺织工厂为首的平壤市区内九个轻工业和手工业企业单位，在讨论中挖出增产八十八亿元的潜力。
    这个关于五年计划的讨论还没有结束，但已取得了很大的效果，从这里人们可以看出朝鲜劳动人民如何支持、热爱劳动党和共和国政府提出的五年计划，并愿为它的实现而奋发努力。
    朝鲜人民在完成五年计划的第一年计划中已经取得了很大成就。
    今年的工业总产值计划比去年增长22％，虽然在燃料、原料、资金、建筑材料等方面存在着许多困难，但是由于从年初劳动人民展开了在不增加设备和人力的条件下挖掘潜力增产节约运动，到现在已超额完成了头七个月的工业总产值计划。今年上半年的计划已超额12％完成了，比原计划增产了一万九千吨生铁，一万八千吨钢，二万三千吨钢材，二十五万吨煤，三万八千吨水泥，四百四十万公尺棉织品等。今年上半年工业部门增产的产值共五十一亿元。
    重要的工厂如金策制铁所的高炉，由于炼铁工人们展开了增产运动，改造了热风装置等设备，从去年年底的生铁日产量五百五十吨提高到今年7月的九百多吨。在7月13日竟创造了一千零四十九吨的最高纪录。平壤纺织工厂的棉布日产量在这一期间内也由十八万公尺提高到二十四万公尺。
    去年没有完成计划的煤炭工业部门今年上半年超额11％完成了计
  划，向各经济部门供应了大量的原料。其他各重要工业部门都完成了计划。
    在节约方面，上半年各工业部门节约了一亿四千多万瓩时电力，五万多吨煤炭和二千多吨钢材等。
      农民们今年提出了把粮食产量提高到三百四十万吨的增产目标，在今春稀有的干旱的情况下，农民们修水渠、挖水井、大力抗旱，在八万七千方町步的缺少水利灌溉的水田里插上了秧，完成了插秧计划面积的94％，并超额完成了旱田播种计划。现在各地的农作物长得很茂盛，有丰收的希望。
    今年上半年朝鲜人民增产节约运动的胜利，证明他们完全能够完成五年计划的第一年的经济计划，为进一步完成五年计划打下基础。
