Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 30th: Materials obtained by the Maebashi District Prosecutor's Office in Japan confirm that U.S. soldier Girard, who is currently on trial, not only shot and killed Japanese woman Sakae Nakako, but also deliberately opened fire on three other Japanese people and two fifteen or sixteen-year-old children on the day of the crime.

Japanese newspapers yesterday published a statement from Rizo Koyama, a witness who saw Girard shoot and kill Sakae Nakako on the spot. Koyama said, "Before Girard shot at me, I saw two children picking up bullet casings on the drill ground; they pointed at Girard and said, 'He is shooting at us.' These two children showed me the empty casings." Koyama also said, "These two children seemed to be from Suma Village." Another witness on the scene, Tatsuo Kanai, said, "At about ten o'clock in the morning on January 30th (the day Girard shot Sakae Nakako), two fifteen or sixteen-year-old children walked towards me and said, 'The American soldier (referring to Girard) is shooting at Mr. Sukuhara (another witness), don't get close to that American soldier.' Then, he (referring to Girard) shot at me, and I fell to the ground." (Attached picture)

　  日本前桥检察当局证实
　　哲腊德还曾枪击几个人
    据新华社30日讯　东京消息：日本前桥地方检察当局获得的材料证实，正在受审的美国兵哲腊德不仅枪杀了日本妇女坂井奈加子，并且在犯罪当天还故意开枪射击过另外三个日本人和两个十五、六岁的孩子。
    日本报纸昨天刊登了当场看到哲腊德枪杀坂井奈加子的见证人小山利三的谈话。小山说：“在我被哲腊德开枪射击以前，曾看到两个拾子弹壳的小孩在演习场上；他们指着哲腊德说，‘他正在射击我们’。这两个孩子把空的弹壳拿给我看”。小山还说：“这两个小孩好像是从须磨村来的。”另一位现场见证人金井龙夫说：“大约在1月30日上午十点钟（哲腊德射杀坂井奈加子当天），两个十五、六岁的小孩向我这边走来，并且说‘美国兵（指哲腊德）正在射击宿原先生（另一证人），不要靠近那个美国兵’，接着，他（指哲腊德）向我开了枪，我就趴到了地上。”（附图片）
