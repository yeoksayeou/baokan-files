    Field Poems Against the Rightists
    The "New Rural Village News" of the Northeast Fujian Fu'an Special District, on its August 10th literary page, published field poems against the Rightists under the title "Singing from Dongshan to Xishan, Singing the Rightists into Speechlessness," featuring works by Ye Zhongqi and others.
    Ye Zhongqi's "Singing for the Rightists to Hear" uses simple language to incisively reveal the sinister nature of the Rightists:
            "Rightists acting like Judge Bao,
            Falsely helping the rectification campaign,
            Pulling together monsters and demons,
            Wanting to settle scores and counterattack."
            "Rightists, quickly examine yourselves,
            Don't try to hide your faces with fans,
            The people hold up the demon-revealing mirror,
            Your true form is that of an ambitious schemer."
            "Rightists, listen carefully,
            The people are of one heart,
            We will resolutely defeat you,
            We will not cease until we are victorious."
    Farmer Li Wucai's "Rightists Reveal Their True Form" consists of four-character lines that are catchy, concise, and powerful:
            "Rightists, Rightists,
            Demons and monsters,
            Stirring up trouble,
            Wanting to come to power.
            Calling white black,
            Calling good bad,
            Fishing in troubled waters,
            With narrow hearts,
            The people are united,
            Counterattacking the Rightists."
    Zhang Xidi's "Scourge" is written as follows:
            "Singing a mountain song for you to hear,
            Cursing the Rightists as a scourge,
            You don't walk the sunny path,
            But insist on taking the single-plank bridge.
            Setting fires in the east and cursing in the west,
            Insisting on making the world uneasy,
            Wanting to steal the beams and replace the pillars,
            Digging at the roots of our people's democratic dictatorship.
            The people are all filled with anger,
            Surrounding them in a tight circle,
            You take the hoe, I take the shovel,
            Pulling out every poisonous weed...!"
    Another field poem, signed by a farmer, refutes the Rightists' slanderous remarks against the cooperativized new countryside:
            "You say the cooperatives are terrible,
            But our production is even more vigorous.
            You say the unified purchase is unacceptable,
            But we sell grain as fast as flying.
            You want the Communist Party to step down,
            But we love the Party even more.
            You want the peasants to follow you,
            One hoe will break your head!"
    Farmers' newspapers in other parts of Fujian have also recently published a large number of anti-Rightist field poems. These works are mostly co-authored by local farmers and rural cultural workers, and have played a role in promoting the current political struggle in the Fujian countryside and inspiring farmers' enthusiasm for production.

    反右派的田头诗
    闽东北福安专区“新农村报”8月10日文艺版，以“东山唱到西山坡，唱得右派无话说”为题，发表了叶忠祺等人的反右派田头诗。
    叶忠祺创作的“唱给右派分子听”，用朴素的语言，一针见血地道破了右派分子的凶恶面目：
            “右派分子假包公，  假心假意助整风，
            牛神鬼怪拉一起，  想要倒算来反攻。”
            “右派分子快检查，  不可持扇把面遮，
            人民手拿照妖镜，  原形是个野心家。”
            “右派分子耳听真，  人民本是一条心，
            坚决把你来打垮，  若不得胜不收兵。”
    农民李无才的“右派现原形”，四字一句，朗朗上口，简短有力：
            “右派右派，妖魔鬼怪，兴风作浪，要想上台。
            是白说黑，是好道坏，混水摸鱼，心肠太隘，
            人民同心，反击右派。”
    张细俤的“害人精”这样写道：
            “唱起山歌你且听，骂声右派害人精，
            阳关大道你不走，  偏向独木小桥行。
            东边点火西边骂，  硬要天下不太平，
            只想偷梁来换柱，  挖我人民专政根。
            人民个个怒火起，  团团把他来围定，
            你拿锄头我拿铲，  株株毒草都锄尽……。”
    另一个署名种田人的田头诗驳斥了右派分子污蔑合作化新农村的谰言：
            “你说合作糟得很，  我们生产更起劲。
            你说统购要不得，  我们卖粮快如飞。
            你要共产党下台，  我们对党更热爱。
            你要农民跟你走，  一锄把你头打坏！”
    福建其他各地的农民报近来也大量刊载了反右派田头诗。这些作品大都是当地农民和农村文化工作者共同创作的，对推动福建农村当前政治斗争和鼓舞农民生产积极性起了作用。  （新华社讯）
