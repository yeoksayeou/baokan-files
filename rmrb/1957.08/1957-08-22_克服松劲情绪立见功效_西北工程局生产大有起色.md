Overcoming Slack Moods Shows Immediate Results
Northwest Engineering Bureau's Production Greatly Improves

　　(Our report) News of creating new records, overfulfilling tasks, and saving raw materials has been continuously coming from the construction sites of the Northwest Engineering Management Bureau in July and August. On July 25th, the Lu Jingju hoisting team of the Northwest Mechanized Construction Company hoisted 111 factory columns in seven and a half hours, breaking the national record of hoisting 82 factory columns in the same amount of time. The oil worker Cai Yuanlong group of the fourth construction area of the Northwest Second Engineering Company, while undertaking roofing projects, adopted advanced experiences such as rubber scraping and prefabricated oil paper, saving a large amount of roofing felt, oil paper, and asphalt, and overfulfilled the task by 19%. The Third Sanitary Equipment Installation Company adopted the suggestion made by engineer Zhang Bangwei to use asbestos, lime, and yellow soil instead of asbestos diatomaceous earth as thermal pipeline insulation material, saving more than 40,000 yuan in an eastern suburb project alone. These are all new signs after the bureau overcame the slack mood in increasing production and practicing economy.

　　The production plan completion situation of the companies under this bureau in the first half of the year was not good, and the losses were serious. The main reason was that the leaders at all levels of the bureau underestimated the series of new problems and difficulties that would arise after the reduction of this year's tasks, and thus developed blind optimism and a slack mood. Therefore, they did not pay close attention to increasing production and practicing economy and daily production work. In order to reverse this situation, the bureau started in July with the Party Committee Secretary Feng Da and Deputy Director Wang Shengwen, along with five other comrades, forming a leading group for increasing production and practicing economy, and established an office for increasing production and practicing economy under the leading group. Subsequently, it organized an inspection of the work in the first half of the year and convened a meeting of managers and Party Committee secretaries of various companies to arrange and deploy the work of increasing production and practicing economy in the second half of the year. Various companies also took active actions and began to gradually form a upsurge of the movement to increase production and practice economy. (Li Qian)

　　克服松劲情绪立见功效
　　西北工程局生产大有起色
    本报讯　7、8月份，西北工程管理总局的各工地上不断传出创造新纪录、超额完成任务、节约原材料的喜讯。7月25日，西北机械化施工公司鲁敬举吊装队以七小时半吊装一百一十一根厂房柱子，打破了用同样时间吊装八十二根厂房柱子的全国纪录。西北第二工程公司四工区油工蔡元龙小组在担任屋面工程中，采用了胶皮刮油法和油纸预制等先进经验，节约了大量油毛毡、油纸和沥青，并超额19％完成了任务。第三卫生设备安装公司采用了张帮维工程师提出的用石棉、石灰、黄土代替石棉矽藻土做热力管道保温材料的建议，在东郊一项工程中就节约了四万多元。这些，都是在这个局克服增产节约工作上的松劲情绪以后的新气象。
    这个局所属各公司上半年完成生产计划情况不好，而且亏损严重，主要原因是该局各级领导对今年任务减少后将产生的一系列的新问题、新困难估计不足，产生了盲目乐观和松劲情绪，因而对增产节约和日常生产工作抓的不紧。为了扭转这种情况，这个局在7月份开始由党委书记冯达和副局长汪胜文等五位同志成立了增产节约领导小组，在领导小组下设立了增产节约办公室。随着，又组织检查了上半年的工作，召开各公司经理和党委书记会议，对下半年的增产节约工作进行了安排和布置。各个公司也积极行动起来，开始逐渐形成增产节约运动的热潮。　（李茜）
