"Some Improvement"
(Zhang Naiqi's "Self-Criticism")
\
Picking up "Today's self-criticism... some improvement," he wears dozens of hats! What individualism, liberalism, arrogance and complacency... piled up to the sky, and also one-sidedness, lack of organization, lack of discipline... winking and making faces. This kind of "mainly ideological self-criticism" is really enjoyable, pushing away all crimes of being anti-Party and anti-socialist. Zongdi has a little more eloquence than "Brother Zong," "only seeking what is beneficial to the revolution, not afraid of being labeled a rightist"! Rightist, ah, can actually get rich for the revolution! Get rich for the revolution—get rich off the revolution—overthrow the revolution to get rich! No wonder the big chin was born to chew big dishes. Once the big chin moves, usually speaking is very "well-behaved," coordinating with a knife hidden behind the back and a thick waist swaying: he "loves the Party Central Committee as much as he loves his own eyeballs"! Watch out for the knife! He "has position and power that were obtained through struggle!" Once the big chin moves again, it's both sour and bad; "After the higher-ups make a decision, I resolutely implement it"! Watch out for the knife! "Blindly obeying the higher-ups," "deifying the higher-ups," "cult of personality"! "Weak and incompetent," ah, "work efficiency is not as good as during the Kuomintang era"! Once the big chin moves again, it becomes even more monstrous: he "has feelings for workers and peasants"! Watch out for the knife! "Unscrupulous," "of poor character," "Beria"! How can a poor kid be worthy of being a leader and running the house! Therefore, with a shake of his pointed head, it is "appropriate": "The Party is in charge of political and ideological work, and I am in charge of administrative leadership"! The people's democratic dictatorship should be auctioned off quickly and without compensation, so that his "extremely right-wing" capitalists and landlords can take the stage! Oh my! These conspiracies must never be admitted or confessed! Gritting his teeth and "scientifically" arranging things, while scolding himself for being "arrogant," he prepares hidden arrows, and turns around and tells the Communist Party to be reborn sooner rather than later! The first arrow criticizes him for expressing opinions on international and class relations, which is truly wrong; secretly slandering the Party for not letting him speak and sanctioning him! The second arrow criticizes his "attitude" for "offending many people" and inviting resentment, secretly slandering the Party for unconditionally attacking and retaliating against him! The third arrow criticizes him for being very ignorant of the united front's "policy-related activities" and "undercurrents," secretly slandering the Party for secretly feeling out the democratic parties! Three poisonous hidden arrows are used to turn defeat into victory, and "self-criticism" thus "improves" and rises; it's like he has sucked his fill of human blood but only says he has eaten a bit of grass, and he chops off people's heads but still says he's just testing the knife! It's like you can't kick a deadbeat rogue as if he was a rock, so throw him into the cesspool, maybe that's better.

    “有所提高”
    （章乃器“检讨”）
    俯拾“今天的检查……有所提高”，连戴几十顶帽！什么个人主义、自由主义、骄傲自满……直堆
  上天，还有片面性、无组织、无纪律……挤眉弄眼。这样的“主要是思想检查”真是痛快，把反党反社会主义的罪行一概推开。宗弟比“宗兄”究竟多点口才，“只求对革命有利，不怕当右派”！右派哇，居然能为革命发财！为革命发财——发革命的财——推翻革命发财！怪不得大下巴生来专会嚼大菜。大下巴一动，平时说话就很“乖”，配合着背里藏刀粗腰款摆：他“爱护党中央像爱护自己眼珠一样”呦！看刀！他“有职有权是斗争得来！”大下巴再一动，又酸又坏；“上级作出决定后我坚决执行”呦！看刀！“盲目服从上级”“神化上级”“个人崇拜”！“软弱无能”啊，“工作效率不如国民党时代”！大下巴又一动，越发妖怪：他“对工农分子有感情”呦！看刀！“不正派”“品质恶劣”“贝利亚”！穷小子怎么配做领导当家！所以啊，一晃尖脑袋，“应该”：“党管政治思想工作，我管行政领导”！人民民主专政赶快无代价拍卖，由他“太右”的资本家、地主上台！哎哟！这些阴谋绝对不能检讨交代！咬着牙根且把“科学”安排，一面骂自己“狂妄”一面准备暗箭，回头三下叫共产党早日投胎！第一箭检讨他发表国际、阶级关系等意见真不
  该，暗中污蔑党不让他说话把他制裁！第二箭检讨他“态度”“得罪了不少人”招来
  怨毒，暗中污蔑党对他无原则的打击报复！第三箭检讨他对统战“政策性活动”“暗流”
  很隔膜，暗中污蔑党对民主党派偷偷摸摸！三枝狠毒的暗箭要转败为胜，“检讨”就这样“提高”上升；好像他吸饱人血只说是吃点点草，砍人脑袋还说是试试刀！对死硬无赖好像对石头不能用脚踢，把它扔进毛坑里吧，也许比较好。
