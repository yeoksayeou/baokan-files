Xinhua News Agency, 11th: The Central Executive Bureau of the Democratic Party of Chinese Peasants and Workers held an enlarged rectification meeting this afternoon, exposing Zhang Yunchuan's consistent anti-Communist and anti-people words and deeds over the past thirty years. This meeting tore off Zhang Yunchuan's mask as a black-faced "Li Kui" and also exposed a conspiratorial clique headed by him.

Ji Fang spoke first at the meeting. He said that Zhang Yunchuan is a notorious anti-Communist figure with thirty years of anti-Communist history. After liberation, Zhang Yunchuan even said privately to others: "I hate that there is no Shouyang Mountain to ascend, and I am ashamed to eat the millet of Zhou." From this sentence, it can be fully seen to what extent Zhang Yunchuan hates the Communist Party and the new society.

Ji Fang said that Zhang Yunchuan's claim that he was a "solo operator" is a complete lie. He is a "fierce general" of the Zhang-Luo alliance, and he organized a small clique headed by him within the Democratic Party of Chinese Peasants and Workers under the Zhang, Huang, and Li right-wing group. The members of this small clique are scattered in the central and local levels of the Democratic Party of Chinese Peasants and Workers, and even among the masses outside the party, and these members are all confidants of Zhang Bojun. From this, we can see the political relationship between Zhang Yunchuan and Zhang Bojun.

Zhang Yunchuan said in his speech that he came today to bow his head and confess his guilt to the people. He had requested before the meeting to "pass the test once and for all" through this meeting. However, at the beginning, he talked eloquently about his "glorious history," and then he talked about some materials that had already been exposed by others. His attitude aroused great dissatisfaction among the people present, who questioned him one after another. Many people asked him to explain the situation of the anti-Communist clique, but Zhang Yunchuan flatly denied it. When everyone cited many facts to question him, he vaguely admitted that a group of people had contact with him, but he did not admit that this was a conspiratorial clique.

Yan Xinmin revealed that Zhang Yunchuan slandered Communist Party members as a "special class" and said: "Their practices harm their descendants. My son complains about why I am not a Communist Party member. The children of people outside the party seem to have been born into the wrong family."

Zhou Difan revealed that Zhang Yunchuan went to Henan to stir up trouble during the period of great blooming and contending. In the short six days in Zhengzhou, he had extensive contacts with right-wing elements in Henan, including Luo Shengwu, the president of Zhengzhou Normal College, Zhang Yunchuan's brother Zhang Zaizheng, Wang Yizhai, the chairman of the Henan Democratic League, Zhang Jingwu, the vice president of Henan Medical College, Zhang Zhonglu, the director of the Henan Provincial Department of Transportation, and Liu Jixue, the vice chairman of the Henan Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang. Now these right-wing elements have been exposed. During his stay in Zhengzhou, Zhang Yunchuan resolutely implemented Zhang Bojun's policy of great development. He once asked someone to copy down the names of Henan senior intellectuals who spoke at the blooming and contending meetings from the Henan Daily as targets for development.

Wang Dalu used to be a member of Zhang Yunchuan's "inner circle." Today, he exposed a series of Zhang Yunchuan's reactionary activities at the meeting.

Wang Dalu said that since 1939, he had been working directly under Zhang Yunchuan's leadership intermittently. After Zhang Yunchuan arrived in Beijing in 1939, he always associated with some traitors, such as Yu Xijie, the vice chairman of the puppet Xinminhui, and Peng Limin, the chief of general affairs. Zhang Yunchuan attempted to win over this group of traitors as his political capital for the third road. At the same time, he also had close relations with He Qigong, the puppet mayor of Beijing, and Zhang Dongsun. At that time, Zhang Yunchuan, Zhang Dongsun, and He Qigong often talked together, and their relationship was very close. Zhang Dongsun once said to Wang Dalu: "I talk to Yunchuan about everything."

Wang Dalu also exposed Zhang Yunchuan's anti-Communist clique within the Democratic Party of Chinese Peasants and Workers. He said that this small clique has a long history and was formed as early as 1949. The people who participated in this small clique are widely distributed. In the central committee of the Democratic Party of Chinese Peasants and Workers, there are He Zhongmin, Ding Fangtuo, Yan Daoying, Qiu Elun, and Wang Zhongying; in the local organizations of the Democratic Party of Chinese Peasants and Workers, there are Wu Menghui, the deputy director of the Tianjin Municipal Committee, Li Xiangruo, the chairman of the Hefei Municipal Committee, Wu Jiandong, a member, and Jin Baimiao, the person in charge of Bengbu.

Wang Dalu also pointed out that this small clique was directly supported by Zhang Bojun. He said that people like He Zhongmin, Ding Fangtuo, Wu Menghui, Qiu Elun, and Wu Jiandong are all confidants of Zhang Bojun.

Wang Dalu revealed that Zhang Yunchuan also had very close relations with some figures of the Luo Longji clique, one of whom was Zhou Jingwen, who once wanted to give the position of deputy secretary-general to Zhang Yunchuan.

Xu Binu spoke at the end of the meeting. He said that after everyone's exposure, Zhang Yunchuan's reactionary landlord class nature has been completely exposed. It turns out that Zhang Yunchuan is a disguised landlord Huang Shiren (referring to the tyrannical landlord Huang Shiren in the drama "The White-Haired Girl"). Xu Binu said that Zhang Yunchuan's reactionary activities are by no means "solo operations" as Zhang Yunchuan himself said, but are organized. He asked Zhang Yunchuan to change his attitude and make a thorough confession.

    农工民主党开会揭露
    张云川是化了装的地主阶级代表
    同时揭发了以张云川为首的一个阴谋小集团
    新华社11日讯　中国农工民主党中央执行局今天下午举行整风扩大会议，揭露张云川三十多年来一贯反共反人民的言行。这次会议揭掉了张云川一向扮演黑脸“李逵”的假面具，还揭露出他的一个阴谋小集团。
    季方在会上首先讲话。他说，张云川是一个著名的反共人物，有三十年反共的历史。解放以后，张云川还私下对人说：“我恨无首阳山可上，耻食周粟。”从这句话里可以充分看出，张云川仇恨共产党、仇恨新社会到了什么程度。
    季方说，张云川说他是一个“跑单帮”的人，这是彻头彻尾的说谎。他是章罗联盟的一员“猛将”，并且在农工民主党内章、黄、李右派集团下面组织了一个以他为首的小集团。这个小集团的分子，散布在农工民主党中央、地方以至党外的群众中，而这些分子又都是章伯钧的亲信人物。从这里可以看出张云川与章伯钧的政治关系。
    张云川在发言时说，他今天是来向人民低头认罪的，他在会前曾要求通过这次会议“一次过关”。可是今天他一开始就夸夸其谈地表白了一通自己的“光荣历史”，继而他讲了一些别人已揭露的材料。他的这种态度引起到会的人极大的不满，纷纷向他质问。许多人要他交代反共小集团的情况，张云川对此矢口否认。当大家举出许多事实追问他时，他含糊其词地承认有一批人同他来往，但是他不承认这是一个阴谋小集团。
    严信民揭露，张云川诬蔑共产党员是“特殊阶级”，并且说：“他们的作法祸及子孙，我的儿子抱怨我为什么不当共产党员，党外人士子弟好像错投了胎一样。”
    周涤凡揭露，张云川在大鸣大放期间跑到河南去点火，在郑州短短的六天中，他同河南的右派分子进行了广泛的联系，其中有郑州师范专科学校校长罗绳武，张云川的兄弟张再铮，河南民盟主委王毅斋，河南医学院副院长张静吾，河南省交通厅厅长张仲鲁，河南民革副主委刘积学等，现在这些右派分子都已被揭发出来。在郑州期间，张云川坚决执行章伯钧大发展的方针。他曾找人把河南日报上河南高级知识分子在鸣放会上发言的人的名字抄下来，准备作为发展的对象。
    王大鲁过去是张云川“小圈圈”里边的人。今天，他在会上揭发了张云川的一系列的反动活动。
    王大鲁说，他从1939年起，就断断续续地在张云川直接领导下做工作。1939年，张云川到北京以后，每次都和一些汉奸来往，如伪新民会的副会长喻熙杰、事务总长彭黎民等，张云川企图拉拢这批汉奸作为他的第三条路线的政治资本。同时他还同伪北京市长何其巩和张东荪有密切的关系。当时，张云川、张东荪、何其巩三人经常在一起谈话，他们的关系非常密切。张东荪曾对王大鲁说：“我对云川是无话不谈的”。
    王大鲁还揭发了张云川在农工民主党内的反共小集团。他说，这个小集团的历史悠久，在1949年就已形成。参加这个小集团的人，方面很广，在农工民主党中央的，有何仲珉、丁方拓、阎道莹、丘锷仑、王仲英；在农工民主党地方组织中的，有天津市委副处长吴孟晖，合肥市主任委员李湘若、委员吴建东，蚌埠负责人金白描等。
    王大鲁还指出，这个小集团是受到章伯钧的直接支持的。他说，像何仲珉、丁方拓、吴孟晖、丘锷仑、吴建东等人都是章伯钧的亲信。
    王大鲁揭发，张云川还和罗隆基小集团的一些人物的关系也非常密切，其中一个人就是周鲸文，周鲸文曾想把副秘书长职位让给张云川。
    徐彬如最后在会上讲话。他说，经过大家的揭露，张云川的反动的地主阶级本质已经完全暴露出来，原来张云川是化了装的地主黄世仁（指话剧“白毛女”中的恶霸地主黄世仁）。徐彬如说，张云川的反动活动，绝不是如张云川自己所说的是“跑单帮”，而是有组织的，他要求张云川转变态度，彻底交代。
