Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 20th. According to TASS, an international symposium on the origin of life on Earth, organized by the Soviet Academy of Sciences and the International Biochemical Union, opened in Moscow on the 19th. Prominent scientists from seventeen countries are participating in this symposium.

Academician Oparin of the Soviet Academy of Sciences pointed out in his opening speech that the first extensive discussion of this most important issue in modern natural science is a great encouragement for future research and resolution of the complex problems concerning the origin of life on Earth.

At the first meeting, scientists discussed the initial formation of the simplest organisms on Earth.

Soviet astronomer Academician Fesenkov has unique research in this area, and his report was read at the symposium. His main contribution is that he believes that the origin of life not only requires sufficient solar radiation and water, but also a large number of chemical elements capable of various compounds. The Earth's surface, covered with continents and oceans, created the conditions for the origin of life over billions of years due to the continuous erosion of the continents and the increasing amount of water in the oceans.

Next, Professor Harold Urey of the United States gave a report entitled "The Primitive Atmosphere of Planets and the Origin of Life."

Academician Vinogradov, Director of the Institute of Geochemistry and Analytical Chemistry of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, gave a report on "The Origin of the Biosphere." Scientists at this institute are engaged in interesting work using isotopic methods to determine the age of a certain geological system on Earth.

The speech of the famous British physicist Professor John Bernal was warmly welcomed. In his report, he clarified some issues concerning the general outline of biological formation on Earth. His theory is that the process of the origin of life went through seven stages, and through these stages, the simplest biological cell appeared, which contains the developmental basis of the cell nucleus that later developed into various plants and animals.

Bernal said that the current meeting proves that the problem of the origin of life can only be solved with the joint efforts of scientists from various disciplines.

The first meeting also heard reports from Soviet and foreign scientists on the evolution of the atmosphere and the formation of the Earth.

### 地球生命从何而来？　各国科学家在莫斯科讨论

　　地球生命从何而来？
　　各国科学家在莫斯科讨论
    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联科学院和国际生物化学联合会组织的地球生命起源的国际讨论会19日在莫斯科开幕。十七个国家的著名科学家参加了这个讨论会。
    苏联科学院院士奥巴林在开幕词中指出，第一次广泛地讨论这一现代自然科学最重要的问题是对今后研究和解决有关地球的生命起源的复杂问题的一个很大鼓励。
    在第一次会议上，科学家们讨论了地球上最简单有机体的最初形成的问题。
    苏联天文学家费新科夫院士在这方面的研究有独到之处，讨论会上宣读了他的报告。他的主要贡献是，他认为，生命的起源不仅需要足够的太阳的辐射和水，而且还需要大量的能够做各种化合的化学元素。布满大陆和海洋的地球的表面在几十亿年的过程中，由于大陆不断被冲毁，海洋的水越来越多就造成了生命起源的条件。
    接着，美国哈罗德·尤雷教授作了题为“行星的原始大气层和生命的起源”的报告。
    苏联地质化学和分析化学研究所所长维诺格拉多夫院士作了“生物界的起源”的报告。这个研究所的科学家们正在从事用同位素的方法确定地球的某个地质层系的年代的有趣工作。
    英国著名物理学家约翰·贝尔纳教授的发言受到了热烈的欢迎。他在报告中阐明了关于地球上生物形成的概貌的一些问题。他的理论是：生命起源的过程经过了七个阶段，经过这些阶段便出现了最简单的生物细胞，这种细胞包含着以后发展为各种动植物的发展基础——细胞核。
    贝尔纳说，目前会议的召开证明，只有在各门科学的科学家们共同努力之下才能解决生命起源的问题。
    第一次会议还听取了苏联科学家和外国科学家做的关于大气的进化和地球形成问题的报告。
