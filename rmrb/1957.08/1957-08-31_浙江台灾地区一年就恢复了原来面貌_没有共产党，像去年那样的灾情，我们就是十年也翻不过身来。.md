　　Zhejiang Typhoon-Hit Areas Recovered to Original State in One Year
  　"Without the Communist Party, with a disaster like last year, we wouldn't have recovered in ten years."
    The areas in Zhejiang Province that suffered from a strong typhoon last August have, after a year of effort, mostly recovered to their original state.

    Over the past year, the government has allocated 10 million yuan in relief funds to the disaster areas, 21 million yuan in agricultural loans, and 3.2 million yuan in water conservancy funds. It has also transferred large quantities of grain, fertilizer, and various disaster relief materials to supply the people in the disaster areas. Now, over 80% of the 850,000 houses destroyed or collapsed by the typhoon throughout the province have been repaired. For those that could not be repaired, the government built new homes for the victims. The 100,000 disaster victims who were homeless at the time now have their own homes. Most of the more than 20,000 sections of sea dikes, culverts, and dams that were destroyed in the typhoon were repaired immediately after the disaster last year and in the spring of this year. Most of the 200 severely affected villages caused by last year's typhoon have now eliminated the disaster situation and become non-disaster villages.

    Many people who suffered from the disaster last year are grateful to the Communist Party and the People's Government for their concern. When they recalled the tragic situation of disaster victims before liberation, they all said: Without the Communist Party, with a disaster like last year, we wouldn't have recovered in ten years. ·Xinhua News Agency·

　　浙江台灾地区一年就恢复了原来面貌
  　“没有共产党，像去年那样的灾情，我们就是十年也翻不过身来。”
    浙江省去年8月遭受强台风袭击的地区，经过一年来的努力，绝大部分已恢复原来的面貌。
    一年来，政府拨发给灾区的救济款就有一千万元，农贷款二千一百万元，水利经费三百二十万元，还调拨了大批粮食、肥料和各种救灾物资供应灾区的人民。现在全省被台风吹毁和倒塌的八十五万间房屋，80％以上都已修理好了，实在不能修理的，政府还为灾民建造了新居。当时十万无家可归的灾民，现在都已有了自己的家园。在台灾中被毁坏的两万多处海塘、涵闸和堤坝，绝大部分在去年灾后和今年春天就已抢修好。去年台灾造成的二百个重灾乡，现在已大部分消除了灾情，变成了非灾乡。
    很多去年受灾的人民都感激共产党和人民政府对他们的关怀。当他们回忆到解放前灾民生活的悲惨情景时，都说：没有共产党，像去年那样的灾情，我们就是十年也翻不过身来。　·新华社·
