Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, August 4th: In the past month, teachers, students, and staff of various universities in Fujian Province have exposed a batch of rightists.

The rightists at Xiamen University, including Zheng Chaozong, Director of the Chinese Department, Chen Bisheng, Research Fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, and student Li Luofang; the rightists at Fujian Normal College, including Professor Qian Luzhou and She Baosheng (female); the rightists at Fujian Medical College, including Vice President Huang Zhenya, Chen Yueming, and lecturer Pan Xiusen (Communist Party member); and the rightists at Fujian Agricultural College, including Professor Huang Zhen and student Zhao Tianzhen, took advantage of the opportunity of the Great Blooming and contending to launch frantic attacks against the Communist Party and socialism.

Since mid-June, teachers, students, and staff of various schools have thoroughly exposed and refuted the fallacies and conspiracies of the rightists in a reasonable manner. Teachers and students of Fujian Medical College refuted the fallacies of Huang Zhenya, Chen Yueming, and others, such as "the Party cannot lead the school," with concrete facts such as the number of teachers having increased fourfold since liberation, and the number of graduates reaching more than 700, exceeding the total of 270 graduates in the eleven years before liberation. Teachers and students of Fujian Agricultural College also systematically refuted the fallacies of the rightist Huang Zhen and others, such as calling poor and lower-middle peasants "new local bullies," with a large number of facts from their own personal experiences. In the struggle, the rightists of various schools were refuted to the point of being speechless, and finally bowed their heads in admission of guilt.

    又一批右派分子在福建现形
    据新华社福州4日电　一个月来，福建省各高等学校师生员工揭露出一批右派分子。
    厦门大学右派分子、中文系主任郑朝宗、南洋研究所研究员陈碧笙和学生李罗芳，福建师范学院右派分子、教授钱履周、佘宝笙（女），福建医学院右派分子、副院长黄震亚、陈阅明和讲师潘秀森（共产党员），福建农学院右派分子、教授黄震和学生赵天珍等，利用大鸣大放的机会，猖狂向共产党向社会主义进攻。
    各校师生员工从6月中旬开始，以说理的方式，彻底揭露和驳斥了右派分子的谬论和阴谋。福建医学院师生以解放后教师增加四倍、毕业生达七百多人，超过解放前十一年毕业生总数二百七十人等具体事实，来驳斥黄震亚、陈阅明等所谓“党不能领导学校”等谬论。福建农学院的师生也用自己亲身经历的大量事实，系统地击破了右派分子黄震等所谓贫雇农是“新恶霸”等谬论。在斗争中，各校右派分子都被驳得理屈词穷，最后表示低头认罪。
