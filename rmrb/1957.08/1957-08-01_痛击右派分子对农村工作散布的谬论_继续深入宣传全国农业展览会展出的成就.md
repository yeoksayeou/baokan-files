Vigorously Criticize the Fallacies Spread by Rightists Against Rural Work
—Continue to Deepen the Publicity of the Achievements Exhibited at the National Agricultural Exhibition
Wan Zhongyi, Deputy Director of the National Agricultural Exhibition

The National Agricultural Exhibition grandly opened in Beijing on February 20 this year. The exhibition lasted for more than five months and received over 2.2 million visitors from home and abroad. It victoriously closed on July 31.

The exhibition was welcomed and praised by visitors from home and abroad. Domestic visitors generally reflected: After seeing the agricultural exhibition, they more deeply realized the greatness and loveliness of the motherland. Therefore, after the closing of the exhibition, continuing to deeply publicize the agricultural production achievements exhibited this time and promoting advanced production experiences are of practical significance for raising the political and ideological consciousness of the broad masses and refuting the absurd statements and actions of those rightists.

Splendid Achievements Cannot Be Erased

One of the ways that bourgeois rightists stirred up an anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist countercurrent was to obliterate achievements. They tried their best to slander our achievements in rural work, spreading fallacies such as "agricultural production has not made any achievements since liberation." The results of the National Agricultural Exhibition prove that the brilliant achievements my country's agriculture has made since liberation cannot be erased by the rightists.

The exhibition materials show that from 1949 to 1956, the total grain output increased by more than 150 billion catties, an increase of 31.6% compared to the highest annual output before liberation (1936); the total cotton output increased by more than 20 million dan, an increase of 11.92 million dan compared to the highest annual output before liberation; the total output of major oil crops such as soybeans, peanuts, and rapeseed more than doubled, and other crops have also greatly increased. In addition, animal husbandry, fishery, forestry, and other sideline productions, as well as water conservancy, land reclamation, and meteorological undertakings, have also developed rapidly. These outstanding achievements have made a deep impression on all visitors. Voroshilov, the leader of our great ally, the Soviet Union, praised after the visit: "This agricultural exhibition is like a mirror, it truly reflects the results of the hard work of Chinese farmers." He also said: "In just a few years, the new China has shown such great achievements, which capitalist countries can never do." After a trade delegation from a Southeast Asian country visited the agricultural exhibition, someone said: "The Americans spread rumors that China suffered a major famine in 1956, that there was not enough food, and that many people starved to death. Seeing the agricultural exhibition exposes this lie." These praises, of course, should not make us complacent in the slightest, but they are a powerful counterattack against the rumors and slanders of the rightists.

Who Says Cooperativization Has Ruined Things?

The great development of agricultural production in our country has been achieved on the basis of land reform, especially the victorious realization of the agricultural cooperative system, which has greatly liberated agricultural productive forces. Therefore, consolidating the agricultural cooperative system is the most fundamental task of current rural work. However, the rightists insisted that agricultural cooperativization has ruined things. The exhibition materials show that agricultural production in our country has indeed risen with the upsurge of agricultural cooperativization.

From the overall situation, in 1956, natural disasters were very serious, but because 96.6% of the farmers in the country had joined cooperatives, which strengthened the ability to resist disasters and ensure harvests, the grain output increased by more than 15 billion catties compared to the bumper year of 1955. Except for disaster areas, 80% of the members increased their income. Looking at the typical materials, there are countless examples. The development of the Jinxing Agricultural Cooperative in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, is a good example. This cooperative is located in a poor mountainous area. Before the War of Resistance, when farming was done individually, the average yield per mu was 130 catties, and the annual income per person was 24 yuan and 5 jiao. Since organizing and implementing comprehensive planning and diversified management of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline industries began in 1942, production and farmers' incomes have increased year by year. Last year, this cooperative suffered a disaster, but its average yield per mu was more than three times higher than in 1942, and the income of each farmer increased by more than half. The Shandong Provincial Delegation said well: "Without cooperativization, there would be no per-mu yield of one hundred catties of ginned cotton, one thousand catties of grain, and ten thousand catties of sweet potatoes, let alone large-scale high yields. Without cooperativization, no one can conquer large areas of beaches and barren mountains, and without cooperativization, it is impossible to have hydropower stations and install electric lights in rural areas." Foreign guests from Asian and African countries were particularly interested in the agricultural cooperativization part of the agricultural exhibition. Some even said that they would adopt China's methods and experience and take the road of cooperativization. Rightists, after seeing these facts and hearing these reactions, what reason do you have to deny the achievements of the entire agricultural cooperativization and its unparalleled superiority?

The Party and the State Strongly Support Agriculture

In order to achieve the purpose of obliterating achievements and spreading rumors, the rightists insisted that the Party and the government had not provided any help to farmers' production. These fallacies can be proved wrong just from the holding of the agricultural exhibition. Holding such a large-scale agricultural exhibition in the capital and organizing 50,000 grassroots cadres and agricultural labor models from all over the country to visit, study, and exchange production experiences is unprecedented in Chinese history. Looking at the materials exhibited, the implementation of land reform has exempted farmers across the country from the burden of paying hundreds of billions of catties of grain in rent every year; the realization of agricultural cooperativization has forever freed farmers from the miserable road of small-scale peasant economy. If there were no leadership of the Communist Party, who could have done these great fundamental reforms? In recent years, the state's support for agricultural production in terms of economy, technology, and talent has also been enormous. The state's agricultural loans have increased from more than 90 million yuan in 1950 to 3.34 billion yuan in 1956. Due to the construction of water conservancy projects, the irrigated area of ​​farmland in my country has increased from 300 million mu in 1949 to 500 million mu in 1956. The supply of new agricultural tools totaled 2.77 million units from 1952 to 1956. It is difficult to list all the other support for agricultural production in terms of scientific research and technology promotion. The thriving of agricultural production in my country in recent years is inseparable from these specific work and assistance provided by the state to agriculture. The farmers who visited the exhibition were generally moved after seeing this part of the material and said: Without such great assistance from the Party and the state, we would not be able to eradicate poverty; since the Party and the state have given us so much assistance, how can we not do our best to improve production! These facts are a good refutation of the rightists' fallacies.

The Soviet Union's Selfless Assistance is an Ironclad Fact

It should also be mentioned here that in the development of agriculture in our country, the great socialist ally, the Soviet Union, and other brother countries have given us important material and technical assistance. Some rightists fabricate all kinds of anti-Soviet fallacies out of thin air, so let them see how much help the Soviet Union has given us from the agricultural exhibition. In 1956, my country had 454 state-owned mechanized farms and pastures, and the wasteland reclaimed and utilized reached 5,625,000 mu; in 1956, my country already had 325 mechanized tractor stations, serving an area of ​​20,330,000 mu. The mechanical equipment required for these farms and stations is mostly supplied by the Soviet Union. The exhibition also showed the achievements of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Farm, which was established entirely with the selfless help of the Soviet Union, and its machinery was given to us by the Soviet Union. This farm was fully put into production in 1956, and in that year alone, it turned over more than 67.87 million catties of marketable grain, turning over profits to the state of about 600,000 yuan. The rightists reverse black and white and distort facts about this deep friendship. It is not difficult for us to see what their intentions are.

Has the Peasants' Life Not Improved?

Since the agricultural production of our country has greatly increased, the life of the peasants must have improved accordingly. This is originally a self-evident matter, but the rightists are reversing black and white, saying that the life of the peasants is declining, and even has reached the "edge of starvation." Then let us talk about the materials exhibited at the agricultural exhibition again. The exhibition materials tell us that the total output value of agriculture and its sideline industries nationwide, taking 1949 as 100, increased to 148.5 in 1952, and further increased to 178.8 in 1956. In 1956, the average output value obtained by each agricultural population increased by 50.1% compared to 1949. With the increase in farmers' income, the purchasing power in rural areas has increased year by year, both in terms of means of production and means of subsistence. For example, the number of livestock purchased (referring to the part supplied through supply and marketing cooperatives) was 384,006 heads in 1954 and 909,715 heads in 1956; the number of agricultural tools purchased was 276,441 units in 1952 and 1,641,475 units in 1956; the quantity of chemical fertilizers purchased increased from 295,088 tons in 1952 to 1,467,000 tons in 1956. The consumption of cloth in rural areas was 45.26 million bolts in 1949, 86.93 million bolts in 1952, and increased to 113.78 million bolts in 1956; rubber shoes were 7.9 million pairs in 1949, 18.84 million pairs in 1952, and 36.39 million pairs in 1956. The sales volume of other edible salt and sugar has also increased significantly. In addition, rural cultural, entertainment, and welfare undertakings are also gradually developing. After reading the above figures, the nonsense of the rightists that the peasants are on the "edge of starvation," their intentions are also self-evident.

Listen to the Voices of 500 Million Peasants

During their frenzied anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-people attacks, the bourgeois rightists spread the above-mentioned fallacies against our rural work. Their real purpose is to slander the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, to vainly attempt to destroy the feelings between the peasants and the Party, to kick the Party out of such a vast front as the countryside, and then to overthrow our incomparably superior socialist system and restore capitalism. However, the rightists' estimates are wrong. The eyes of the peasants are sharp. Based on their personal experience, they deeply know that their ability to be masters of their own affairs, the rapid development of agricultural production, and the considerable improvement in their lives are all due to the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and to the socialist system. As a peasant who visited the agricultural exhibition said: After visiting the agricultural exhibition, we have a clearer understanding of the achievements and bright prospects of agricultural development in our country under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government. We will always follow the Communist Party. The voice of this peasant should be said to be the voice of more than 500 million peasants. If the rightists are still obsessed and dare to shake the Party's leadership and the socialist system in front of the peasants, they will be bloodied and battered.

    痛击右派分子对农村工作散布的谬论
    ——继续深入宣传全国农业展览会展出的成就
    全国农业展览会副馆长　万众一
    全国农业展览会于今年2月20日在北京隆重开幕，展出时间共五个多月，接待国内外观众达二百二十多万人次，到7月31日胜利闭幕了。
    展览会的展出，受到了国内外观众的欢迎和赞扬。国内观众普遍反映：看了农展会，更加深刻地体会到祖国的伟大和可爱。因此，在展览会闭幕以后，继续深入宣传这次展出的农业生产成就，推广先进生产经验，对提高广大群众的政治思想觉悟，对驳斥那些右派分子的荒谬言论行动，都是具有现实意义的。
    辉煌的成绩抹煞不了
    资产阶级右派分子煽起反党、反人民、反社会主义逆流的办法之一，就是抹煞成绩，他们竭力诬蔑我们在农村工作中的成绩，散播什么“解放以来农业生产没有什么成就”等谬论。全国农业展览会展出的结果证明，我国农业在解放以来所取得的光辉成就，是右派分子绝对抹煞不掉的。
    展览会的材料说明，从1949年到1956年，粮食总产量增加了一千五百多亿斤，比解放前最高年产量（1936年）增加了31.6％；棉花总产量增加了二千多万担，比解放前最高年产量增加了一千一百九十二万担；大豆、花生、油菜子等主要油料作物的总产量增加了一倍多，其他农作物也都有很大的增产。此外，畜牧业、渔业、林业和其他副业生产以及水利、垦殖和气象事业，也都有飞跃的发展。这些突出的成就，使所有观众得到了深刻的印象。我们伟大的友邦苏联领袖伏罗希洛夫主席参观后称赞说：“这农展会像一面镜子，它真正反映出了中国农民辛勤劳动的成果”。又说：“在短短的几年内，新中国就表现出如此巨大的成绩，这绝非资本主义国家所能办到的”。东南亚一个国家的贸易代表团看过农展会后，有人说：“美国人造谣说中国1956年闹了大灾荒，粮食不够吃，饿死好多人，看过农展会，揭穿了这个鬼话”。这些称誉，对我们来说，固然不应有丝毫自满，但对右派分子的造谣诬蔑来说，却正是一个有力的回击。
    谁说合作化搞坏了？
    我国农业生产的巨大发展，是在土地改革，特别是农业合作制度的胜利实现，大大地解放了农业生产力的基础上取得的。因之，巩固农业合作制度，是目前农村工作最根本的任务。但是右派分子却硬说我国农业合作化搞坏了。展览材料说明，我国农业生产，确是随农业合作化的高涨而高涨的。
    从总的情况看，在1956年，自然灾害很重，但由于全国已有96.6％的农户参加了合作社，加强了抗灾保收的能力，所以粮食产量比丰收的1955年还增加了一百五十多亿斤，除灾区外，有80％的社员增加了收入。从典型材料看，例子更是举不胜举。山西平顺县金星农业社的发展，就是一个很好的例子。这个社处在贫瘠山区，抗战前单干时每亩地的平均收成是一百三十斤，每年每人的收入是二十四元五角。从1942年开始组织起来，实行全面规划和农、林、牧、副业多种经营以后，生产和农民的收入逐年增加。去年这个社受了灾，可是它的每亩地的平均收成比1942年提高了两倍多，每个农民的收入增加一倍半还多。山东省参观团说得好：“没有合作化就没有亩产百斤皮棉、千斤粮、万斤地瓜，更没有大面积的丰产。没有合作化谁也征服不了大面积的沙滩和荒山，没有合作化更不可能出现水电站，使农村中安上了电灯。”来自亚非国家的外宾们，对农展会展出的农业合作化部分特别感到兴趣。有的人甚至表示要采取中国的方式和经验，走合作化的道路。右派分子们，看到这些事实和听到这些反映后，还有什么理由再来否定整个农业合作化的成就和它的无比的优越性呢？
    党和国家大力支援了农业
    右派分子们为了达到抹煞成绩、造谣诽谤的目的，硬说党和政府对农民生产没有进行什么帮助。这些谰言，仅从农业展览会的举办，就足可证明其谬误。在首都举办这样大规模的农业展览会，并在全国范围内组织基层干部、农业劳动模范五万来人前来参观、学习和交流生产经验，这在中国历史上还是空前的。再从展出的材料看，实行土地改革，使全国农民每年免除了几百亿斤粮食的地租负担；实现农业合作化，使农民永远离开了小农经济悲惨的道路。这些伟大的根本的改革，假如没有共产党领导，谁能办得到呢？几年来国家在经济上、技术上、人才上对农业生产的支援，也是巨大的。国家发放农业贷款，从1950年的九千多万元增长到1956年的三十三亿四千万元。因兴修水利，我国农田灌溉面积已由1949年的三亿亩，增长到1956年的五亿亩。供应新式农具，1952年到1956年共达二百七十七万架。其他在科学研究和技术推广方面对农业生产的支援，很难一一列举。几年来我国农业生产的蒸蒸日上，和国家对农业进行了这些具体工作和援助是分不开的。参观展览会的农民，看了这部分材料普遍感动的说：没有党和国家给我们这样大的援助，我们是不会拔掉穷根的；党和国家既然给了我们这样多的援助，我们怎还能不尽力搞好生产呢！这些事实，对右派分子谰言，正是很好的驳斥。
    苏联的无私援助是铁一样的事实
    这里还应该提到的是，在我国农业发展中，伟大的社会主义友邦苏联和其他兄弟国家，都曾给了我们重要的物资援助和技术援助。右派分子们有的人无中生有的制造各种反苏谰言，那么就让他们从农业展览会上看看友邦苏联给了我们多大的帮助吧。1956年，我国有国营机械农场、牧场四百五十四处，开垦和利用的荒地达五百六十二万五千亩，1957年计划开荒六百万亩；1956年我国已有机械拖拉机站三百二十五个，服务面积二千零三十三万亩。这些场站所需用的机械装备，绝大部分是苏联供应我们的。展览会上还有中苏友谊农场的成就，这个场完全是在苏联无私的帮助下建立起来的，它的机械是苏联送给我们的。这个农场1956年全面投入生产，这一年上缴商品粮食就达六千七百八十七万余斤，给国家上缴利润约六十万元左右。对这种深厚的友谊，右派分子却颠倒黑白，歪曲事实，我们真不难看出他居心何在。
    农民生活没有上升吗？
    我国农业生产量既然大有增加，农民生活自必随之上升，这本来是不讲自明的事情，但是右派分子却在颠倒黑白地说农民生活是在下降，甚至已经到了“饿死的边缘”。那我们就再从农展会上展出的材料来讲吧。展出材料告诉我们，全国农业及其副业的总产值，以1949年为一百，1952年增长为一百四十八点五，1956年更增长为一百七十八点八。1956年每个农业人口平均所得的产值，要比1949年增加了50.1％。随着农民收入增长，不论在生产资料和生活资料方面，农村购买力逐年都有增长。比如购买牲畜的数量（指通过供销社供应的部分）1954年为三十八万四千零六头，1956年为九十万九千七百一十五头；购买农具的数量，1952年为二十七万六千四百四十一部，1956年则为一百六十四万一千四百七十五部；购买化学肥料的数量1952年为二十九万五千零八十八吨，1956年则上升为一百四十六万七千吨。农村布匹消费量1949年为四千五百二十六万匹，1952年为八千六百九十三万匹，到1956年则增到一亿一千三百七十八万匹；胶鞋1949年为七百九十万双，1952年为一千八百八十四万双，到1956年则为三千六百三十九万双。其他食盐、糖的销售量也都有显著上升。此外，农村的文化、娱乐、福利等事业也在逐步开展。看了上列的数字后，右派分子们所说的农民在“饿死边缘”的鬼话，其用心倒也是不讲自明了。
    听听五亿农民的声音
    资产阶级右派分子在反党反社会主义反人民的猖狂进攻中，对我们农村工作散播如上面所说的种种谬论，其真实目的，是要诬蔑中国共产党的领导，妄想破坏农民和党的感情，把党从农村这样一条极其广阔的战线上一脚踢开，进而推翻我国无比优越的社会主义制度，使资本主义复辟。但是，右派分子们的估计错了，农民的眼睛是雪亮的。他们凭亲身体验，深知自己其所以能够当家作主，农业生产能够迅速发展，生活有了相当改善，都应归功于中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导，归功于社会主义制度。正如参观农展会的一位农民所说：参观了农展会，更清楚地看到了在党和人民政府领导下，我国农业发展的成就和美好的远景。我们要永远跟着共产党走。这位农民的声音，应该说就是五亿多农民的声音。右派分子们如果还执迷不悟，胆敢在农民面前动摇党的领导，动摇社会主义制度，那就会使他碰的鼻青脸肿头破血流。
