Zhang Bojun, the rightist ringleader, confessed that he "believed there was much to be gained from activities in Beijing." The materials presented here prove that what he said was not empty talk. He indeed engaged in numerous anti-socialist activities in Beijing, where there was much to be gained.

Stirring Up Trouble from Nowhere

The Party organization of the Ministry of Agriculture officially launched the rectification campaign on May 10th. By the beginning of June, the leading group had held seven forums with non-Party members to solicit opinions. It was at this time that a sudden storm arose: within a few days, more than three hundred big-character posters were put up, and the tone of the speeches at the forums also changed. Shortcomings were exaggerated, right and wrong were reversed, and attacks and slanders against the Party reached a fever pitch. The Communist Youth League was called a thug. Active elements were called shameless. At the forum on June 6th, several rightists, misappropriating the names of four democratic parties (the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, the China Democratic League, the Jiu San Society, and the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang), put forward so-called joint proposals demanding the establishment of an organization for "rehabilitation." In a separate proposal made by misappropriating the name of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang branch, in addition to proposing that democratic parties participate in "rehabilitation," it also demanded participation in leading the Party's rectification. This caused ideological confusion among the masses, and the Party's rectification steps were also impacted.

Paving the Way for Zhang Bojun

There are no waves without wind. It turned out that while the Party group of the Ministry of Agriculture was studying the rectification plan, Zeng Xianpu, Deputy Director of the Economic Crops Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture and Director of the Agricultural Ministry Branch of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, received instructions from Zhang Bojun to take the opportunity to attack.

On May 8th, Zhang Bojun, Huang Qixiang, and Li Boqiu hosted a banquet for more than twenty "senior intellectuals" at the CPPCC Cultural Club, launching an attack on the Party. At the meeting, Zeng Xianpu was designated as the person in charge of the forums on agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy. Later, Shen Zengkan (technician of the Seed Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture and member of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party) was designated as the liaison for the forums in the Ministry of Agriculture. Zhang Bojun also incited at the meeting, saying, "Chairman Mao said: The American presidential system is very good, with elections every four years, everyone taking turns." Zeng Xianpu also said triumphantly after returning to the Ministry of Agriculture: "This meeting was very good. Now I understand what is meant by organizational life." After that, they maintained frequent contact.

Under the leadership of Zeng Xianpu and Shen Zengkan, four forums were held in the agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy circles. At the same time, within the Ministry of Agriculture, a right-wing small group headed by Zeng Xianpu, including Shen Zengkan, Guo Shufan (technician of the Seed Bureau and member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang), and Liu Guofang (clerk of the Seed Bureau and member and secretary of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang branch), was formed. This group maintained close contact and echoed each other with two other small groups, attacking the Party together.

Zeng Xianpu is a complete double-dealer, publicly talking about supporting the Communist Party and praising socialism. Behind his back, he was constantly firing arrows at the Party. When Vice Minister Liu Ruilong announced that he was prepared to deal with Mo Dingsen's unsolved case during the Three-Anti Campaign, but because the problem occurred when Mo was working in Zhejiang, he asked him to write about the situation at that time. Zeng Xianpu took the opportunity to provoke, saying: Since you are apologizing, why do you want people to write materials? I am not satisfied. He incited: I am not afraid of death, nor will I die early. Zeng Xianpu also personally went to various departments to create contradictions, spreading everywhere that the Party does not value the elderly, that there are contradictions between young people and old people, etc. Even though there was not a single elderly person in the Fourth Division, he insisted that there were contradictions between young people and old people. In addition to activities within the Ministry, Zeng Xianpu also engaged in activities in the Ministry of Water Conservancy, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Agriculture, and the Agricultural University. Zeng Xianpu's anti-Party behavior has been going on for a long time. Several years ago, he fabricated the so-called rumor of a "minister in charge of the house," attempting to provoke the relationship between Party and non-Party ministers.

After Shen Zengkan contacted Guo Shufan and others within the Seed Bureau, they jointly planned to first take down the Seed Bureau, and then the Grain Bureau, the Economic Crops Bureau, the Administrative Office, the Public Affairs Team, and the Agricultural Reclamation Department.

Starting with Welfare and Benefits

The right-wing generals instructed: When attacking, it is necessary to mobilize the masses and raise questions not solely from a personal perspective. Therefore, they first started with welfare and benefits, and promotion and salary assessment. They created the so-called "politicization of welfare funds," saying that the most Party members received welfare subsidies, and that administrative cadres and Party and Youth League members were the only ones promoted and given pay raises. The comrades in the units where these opinions were raised, used facts to shatter their lies. Comrades in the Seed Bureau statistically found that since the establishment of the bureau, a total of seven people had been subsidized, of whom six were from the masses, and only one was a Party member. Moreover, two rightists were also the recipients of subsidies. Among all the personnel promoted in the Ministry of Agriculture last year, Party members only accounted for 25.3%, and only six of the total of three hundred and sixteen technicians were not promoted. The facts gave the rightists a heavy blow.

Of course, dealing with these issues was not their real purpose, but only an attempt to incite the masses. Please see, after they raised the issue of a certain leading comrade receiving excessive subsidies and living in excessive housing, didn't they immediately propose to remove this comrade from his leadership position in the rectification campaign, while also demanding that they be allowed to participate in leading the rectification campaign?

Attacking Personnel and Anti-Secret Agent Work

The spearhead of their attack often pointed to the personnel departments and anti-secret agent work. Someone called the cadres of the Personnel Division personnel police. They warned the personnel secretary to study hard on how to be a person, and not to be a personnel police anymore. Guo Shufan has always been dissatisfied with being investigated in the anti-secret agent campaign. After the start of the rectification campaign, he everywhere slandered the anti-secret agent movement, demanding the public release of personnel files and the abolition of personnel secretaries. Why did they hate the anti-secret agent and personnel departments so much? Were they wronged in some places? No. Take Guo Shufan as an example. He had close contact with the secret agent leader Dai Li. In the early days of the anti-secret agent campaign, three letters reported that he was an active secret agent. One of the informants was his brother-in-law. The personnel department sent people to run through more than a dozen provinces and investigated more than a hundred people, and finally came to a conclusion for him. What was done wrong to him? Shen Zengkan, who said that the Communist Party had a microscope, joined the Kuomintang before liberation through the introduction of Gu Zhenggang and served as the secretary of the Kuomintang district branch, but he had never confessed his political history in the eight years since liberation. It is no wonder that he is dissatisfied with personnel and anti-secret agent work. Germs are of course most afraid of microscopes.

Everything to Eliminate the Communist Party

Another tactic of the rightists' attack was to negate everything, portraying socialism as a complete mess. When the Party group of the Ministry of Agriculture determined that "subjectivism in agricultural production guidance" should be the focus of the rectification campaign, the rightists immediately instructed people to write a big-character poster titled "Is it necessary for the Ministry of Agriculture to exist?" saying that the Ministry of Agriculture had not played a role at all in the past few years, but had simply followed the Rural Work Department, and that there was no question of subjectivism. The real intention of this big-character poster was to say that since there was a national Ministry of Agriculture, there was no need for the Party's Rural Work Department.

The rightist Shen Zengkan also slandered, saying: Sectarianists have three arguments: first, class theory; second, background theory; and third, historical theory. Now many Party members use this argument to view all problems, and anything that does not conform to this argument is considered poisonous. He also said that the Ministry of Agriculture has three mirrors. One is a microscope, used to look at old personnel and old technology, feeling that everything is poisonous and has germs. One is a magnifying glass, used to look at Party members and themselves, feeling that their composition is good, their quality is good, and although they are small, they are big. There is also a pair of red glasses, which think that everything that is red is good. Based on the fallacies they fabricated, the rightists viciously proposed the so-called "remove the head above, cut off the feet below, and insert a handle in the middle" plan. That is to say, the Rural Work Department is abolished above, the rural work departments of the prefectural and county committees are removed below, and the Ministry of Agriculture is left to them to manage. All of this is for no other reason than to eliminate the leadership of the Communist Party.

Turning Back is the Shore

No matter what tactics the rightists use, they cannot escape the eyes of the people. When people saw their true colors, they were no longer deceived by them, and no longer allowed them to act recklessly. Since the beginning of July, staff members of various units of the Ministry of Agriculture have held several forums separately or jointly to counterattack the rightist remarks. However, until now, some of them are hiding, and some are still trying to resist stubbornly. Now the anti-rightist struggle is in full swing, and the people demand that this struggle be carried through to the end. Where the rightists go from here depends on their own choices.

    章伯钧伸进农业部的爪牙
    本报记者　慧之
    右派头子章伯钧初步交代说他“认为北京的活动大有搞头”。这里介绍的材料，证明他所说的不是空话。他确实在这个大有搞头的北京，搞了不少反社会主义的活动。
    平地起风波
    农业部党组织从5月10日正式动员整风，到6月初止，领导小组已陆续召开过七次党外人士座谈会，征求意见。就在这时，忽然出现了巨浪：几天之内贴出了三百多张大字报，座谈会上的发言也变了声调，夸大缺点，颠倒是非，对党的攻击、谩骂，达到了疯狂的程度。骂共青团是打手。骂积极分子是无耻之徒。6月6日的座谈会上，几个右派分子盗用四个民主党派（农工、民盟、九三、民革）的名义提出了所谓联合建议，要求成立“平反”组织。盗用民革支部名义所作的单独建议中，除提出民主党派参加“平反”外，还要参加领导党的整风。这样便引起了群众的思想混乱，党的整风步骤也受到了冲击。
    为章伯钧打先锋
    无风不起浪，原来在农业部党组研究整风计划的同时，农业部经济作物总局副局长、农工民主党农业部总支主任委员曾宪朴从章伯钧处接到了乘机进攻的指示。
    5月8日，章伯钧、黄琪翔、李伯球在政协文化俱乐部宴请二十多位“高级知识分子”，发动向党进攻。会上确定曾宪朴为农林水利方面座谈会负责人，以后又确定沈增侃（农业部种子局技师、农工民主党成员）为农业部座谈会的联络员。章伯钧在会上还鼓动说：“毛主席说：美国总统制很好，四年一换，大家轮流着干嘛。”曾宪朴回农业部后也得意地说：“这次会开得很好，我现在才懂得什么叫做组织生活。”这以后，他们之间就保持着经常的接触。
    在曾宪朴和沈增侃的主持下，农林水利界的座谈会开了四次。与此同时，在农业部内已经形成了以曾宪朴为首包括沈增侃、郭树藩（种子局技师、民革成员）刘国芳（种子局科员、民革支委兼秘书）等人的右派小集团。这个集团又与另外两个小集团密切联系、互相呼应，一齐向党进攻。
    曾宪朴是个十足的两面派，公开谈话时不是拥护共产党，就是赞扬社会主义。背地里却时时都在向党放暗箭。刘瑞龙副部长宣称对莫定森在三反时的悬案问题已准备处理，但因问题发生时莫在浙江工作，因此要他写一下当时情况，曾宪朴便乘机挑拨说：既然道歉，又要人家写材料，我就不满意。并鼓动说：我就不怕死，也不早死。曾宪朴还亲自到各个处里去制造矛盾，到处宣传党不重视老年人，青年和老年有矛盾等。第四处没有一个老年人，他也硬说有青年和老年的矛盾。除在部内活动外，曾宪朴还向水利部、北京市农业局和农业大学等处活动过。曾宪朴的反党是由来已久的，几年以前就曾制造过所谓“当家部长”的谣言，企图挑拨党和非党部长的关系。
    沈增侃在种子局内联络上郭树藩等人以后，便共同策划先搞下种子局，而后再搞粮食局、经济作物局、行政处、公务班以及农垦部等单位。
    从生活福利下手
    右派主将指示：进攻时要发动群众，提问题不要单从个人出发。因此，他们首先从生活福利、提级评薪方面下手。制造了所谓“福利费政治化”，说领福利补助费的党员最多，提级加薪的都是行政干部和党团员。提这些意见的右派分子所在单位的同志，用事实粉碎了他们的谎言。种子局的同志统计一下，自从成立这个局以来，共补助过七个人，其中六名是群众，只有一人是党员，而且有两个右派分子还是补助对象。农业部去年全部升级人员中，党员也只占25.3％，全部三百一十六名技术人员中只有六名没升级。事实给了右派分子沉重的打击。
    当然，搞这些问题并不是他们真正的目的，只不过企图用此煽动群众而已，请看，他们在提出某领导同志多领补助费、多住房之后，不是紧跟着就提出要撤销这个同志的整风领导职务，同时又要求让他们参加领导整风吗？
    攻击人事和肃反工作
    他们进攻的矛头还常常指向人事部门和肃反工作。有人骂人事司干部是人事警察。警告人事秘书要他好好学习做人，不要再干这个人事警察了。郭树藩对他在肃反中被审查一直不服气。整风开始后，到处诬蔑肃反运动，要求公开人事档案，废除人事秘书。他们为什么这样仇恨肃反和人事部门呢？是不是某些地方委屈他们了呢？不是的。就以郭树藩来说吧，他和特务头子戴笠有过密切的往来，肃反初期有三封信检举他是现行特务，检举人之一是他的妻弟。人事部门派人跑了十几省，调查了一百多人，最后替他做了结论。这有什么对不起他呢？说共产党有显微镜的沈增侃，解放前曾由谷正纲介绍加入国民党，担任过国民党区分部书记，解放八年来却一直没有交代过政治历史问题。这就难怪他对人事和肃反工作不满了。病菌当然最怕显微镜了。
    一切为了排除共产党
    右派分子进攻的另一手法，是否定一切，把社会主义说成一塌糊涂。当农业部党组确定以“农业生产指导中的主观主义”为整风重点时，右派分子马上指使人写了“农业部是否需要存在？”的大字报，说农业部几年来根本没起作用，而是人云亦云地跟着农村工作部跑，谈不上什么主观主义。这个大字报的真正用意，是说既有国家的农业部，就不必要有党的农村工作部。
    右派分子沈增侃还污蔑说：宗派主义者有三个论点：第一是阶级论，第二是出身论，第三是历史论，现在许多党员都用这个论点来看一切问题，不合这个论点的就认为有毒。又说农业部有三面镜子，一面是显微镜，用来看旧人员，旧技术，觉得一切都有毒，有细菌。一面是放大镜，用来看党员，看自己，觉得自己成分好，品质好，本身虽小也就大了。还有一种是红色眼镜，只要是红色都好。右派分子根据自己所捏造的谬论，便恶毒地提出了所谓“上边去掉头，下边砍掉脚，中间插一把”的方案。也就是说上边取消农村工作部，下边去掉地、县委农村工作部，农业部让他们来搞。所有这一切不是为别的，都是为了排除共产党的领导。
    回头是岸
    右派分子不管使用什么手法也逃避不了人民的眼睛。当人们看清他们的真面目以后，再也不受他们蒙蔽，再也不容许他们胡作非为了。从7月初开始，农业部各单位的工作人员，已分别或联合举行了多次座谈会，反击右派言论。可是，直到现在，他们有的躲躲藏藏，有的还企图顽抗。现在反右派斗争方兴未艾，人民要求把这一斗争进行到底。右派分子们何去何从，这要看他们自己怎样抉择了。
