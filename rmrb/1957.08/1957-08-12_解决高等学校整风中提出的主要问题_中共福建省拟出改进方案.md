Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 11th -- The CCP Fujian Provincial Committee recently convened meetings of professors from various higher education institutions and responsible individuals from relevant units to earnestly study and resolve constructive criticisms and suggestions put forward by these institutions during the rectification movement. Jiang Yizhen and Lin Yixin, Secretaries of the CCP Fujian Provincial Committee, participated in each meeting.

Prior to holding these meetings, the CCP Fujian Provincial Committee conducted multiple studies of the main issues raised by the various higher education institutions during the rectification movement and formulated proposed solutions. During the meeting addressing the problems of Fujian Medical College, the focus was on strengthening clinical teaching. In the past, clinical teaching at Fujian Medical College was conducted in affiliated hospitals and teaching hospitals. Clinical teachers had to complete demanding medical duties while also fulfilling their teaching responsibilities, leading to many difficulties and affecting further improvements in teaching quality. Based on the principle of both caring for the medical college's teaching needs and considering societal medical obligations, the CCP Fujian Provincial Committee proposed several plans, which were discussed with the attending professors and physicians. Attendees also had differing opinions on resolving this issue. Therefore, the CCP Fujian Provincial Committee decided that Lan Rongyu (who is also the Deputy Governor of Fujian Province), a member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Committee, would be responsible for continuing discussions with relevant parties to find a proper solution.

Regarding Fujian Agricultural College, the main issues addressed were the urgent need to strengthen the teaching staff of the Forestry Department and the basic construction of the new campus. The issues raised by Xiamen University and Fujian Normal College during the rectification movement are also being studied and resolved.

The professors were very moved to be invited to participate in these meetings to study and resolve school problems. They said that the Provincial Committee's approach of following the mass line to solve problems will certainly lead to proper resolutions for the issues in the colleges. They expressed their commitment to running the schools even better under the leadership of the Provincial Committee.

    解决高等学校整风中提出的主要问题
    中共福建省拟出改进方案
    新华社福州11日电　中共福建省委最近分别召开各高等学校教授和有关单位负责人会议，认真研究解决各高等学校在整风中提出的建设性批评和建议。中共福建省委书记江一真、林一心分别参加了每次会议。
    中共福建省委在召开这种会议之前，将各高等学校在整风中所提出的主要问题，进行了多次研究，并拟出了解决方案。在研究福建医学院问题的会议上，着重讨论了加强临床教学工作的问题。过去福建医学院的临床教学工作是在附属医院和教学医院中进行的，临床教师要在完成繁重的医疗任务的情况下完成教学任务，困难很多，影响教学质量的进一步提高。中共福建省委根据既要照顾医学院教学又要照顾社会医疗任务的原则，提出了几种方案，同到会的教授和医师们一起研究，与会者对解决这个问题也有几种不同的意见。因此，中共福建省委决定由省委常务委员蓝荣玉（也是福建省副省长）负责继续同有关方面进一步商讨，务求妥善解决。
    对福建农学院的问题，主要研究解决了这个学院急待加强的林学系的教学力量和新校址的基本建设问题。厦门大学和福建师范学院在整风中提出的问题，也正在研究解决中。
    教授们被邀请参加这种研究解决学校问题的会议，非常感动。他们说省委这种走群众路线解决问题的办法，一定可以把学院中的问题妥善解决。他们表示要在省委的领导下把学校办得更好。
