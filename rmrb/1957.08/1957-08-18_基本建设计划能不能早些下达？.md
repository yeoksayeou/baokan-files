Can Basic Construction Plans Be Issued Earlier?
Yan Cuiyou

It has been more than four years since our country began carrying out basic construction in a planned way. We have achieved great success in basic construction work, and the basic construction investment amount of the first Five-Year Plan is expected to be overfulfilled. However, according to the execution of basic construction plans over the years, there are still some problems and shortcomings in basic construction work, especially the phenomenon of late plan issuance is very serious. The 1954 plan was issued in June of that year, the 1955 plan was issued in April, and the 1956 plan was issued in March. The 1957 plan was originally issued at the end of last year, but due to some imbalances in some links, it was reissued in April this year.

When the state plan is issued late, the various ministries and provinces (cities) cannot arrange basic construction work in advance. After receiving the tasks issued by the state, and after research and balancing, the plans are passed down to the grassroots level, the time is even later. The plans of some departments are officially issued to the grassroots units in the third quarter of the year. Due to the late issuance of the basic construction plan, it has resulted in work stoppages in the first half of the year, especially in the first quarter, and rush work in the second half of the year, especially in the fourth quarter. For example, in the first half of 1955, only 34.2% of the total investment for the year was completed, of which only 10.7% was completed in the first quarter, while 65.8% of the investment was completed in the second half of the year, of which 42% was accounted for in the fourth quarter; in the first half of 1956, 34.6% was completed, of which only 12% was completed in the first quarter, and 65.4% was completed in the second half of the year, of which 39.8% was completed in the fourth quarter.

This state of "waiting in the spring, idle in the summer, busy in the autumn, and rushing in the winter" in basic construction work has brought a lot of waste and losses to the country. During the work stoppage period, the production capacity of construction enterprises cannot be fully utilized, and the surplus workers have to be temporarily dismissed or paid idle work fees, which reduces labor productivity. During rush work, a large number of workers have to be added. In the spring of the following year, there will be work stoppages again due to insufficient tasks. Adding workers during rush work and reducing workers during work stoppages creates a vicious cycle. At the same time, under urgent tasks, construction preparation work, engineering quality and safety measures are often ignored, which leads to chaotic construction organization and increased engineering quality accidents and safety accidents. Some projects are delayed in the construction season due to the late issuance of plans, and winter construction must be carried out, which requires additional winter construction costs. The late issuance of plans sometimes also affects the timely completion of basic construction plans. Therefore, striving to issue plans in advance is of great significance.

Why are basic construction plans issued late? There are two main reasons:

First, the national economy is complex and intricate, and basic construction indicators are mutually constrained by production, undertakings, finance and other indicators. The scale of basic construction depends not only on the needs of production and the development of undertakings, but also on the existing level of production, that is, on the guarantee conditions of material and financial resources. Our country is still an agricultural country, and the proportion of national financial revenue directly or indirectly from agriculture is very large. Therefore, the bumper or poor harvest of agriculture has a great impact on the arrangement of basic construction plans. At present, agricultural production cannot get rid of the constraints of natural conditions, and it is difficult to predict the success or failure of agricultural harvests. It can only be determined relatively reliably after the autumn harvest. After the agricultural harvest is determined, the fiscal revenue can be calculated, and the basic construction investment can be determined according to the proportion of accumulation and consumption. This naturally affects the time for preparing and issuing plans.

The second reason is that we lack experience in economic and cultural construction, and many important economic issues need to be repeatedly studied and balanced; we do not have enough understanding of the domestic economic situation, and we lack a complete set of methods and scientific quota data for balancing and accounting work. Therefore, when arranging annual plans, we have to take some detours and arrange more plans to make the plans closer to reality. This naturally takes more time and delays the issuance of plans.

However, we must not deny the possibility of issuing plans in advance because of this. We have several years of experience in preparing plans, and it is conditional to shorten the plan preparation process and issue plans in advance. Some comrades believe that to overcome the shortcomings of late plan issuance, it is best to change the plan year (such as taking July 1, 1957 to June 30, 1958 as the 1957 plan year); or issue some indicators in advance. These are not effective methods and are difficult. We believe that to issue plans in advance, we must start from the following points:

First, we must get rid of the impact of agriculture on the arrangement of basic construction plans, and change the practice of determining fiscal revenue based on agricultural harvests, and then determining basic construction investment based on fiscal revenue. Otherwise, the plan will never be issued in advance. Our country is large, the natural conditions of various regions are different, and there are many types of crops. On a national scale, although it is difficult to have a year of comprehensive harvest, it is also impossible to have a year of comprehensive poor harvest. If area A suffers a disaster and reduces production, area B may have a bumper harvest and increase production; if crop A has a poor harvest, crop B may have a bumper harvest. Therefore, there is always a general pattern for the harvest volume of bumper years, poor harvest years, or average years. We can predict this year's agricultural harvest based on the past few years' patterns, determine fiscal revenue early on the basis of prediction, so as to determine basic construction investment early and issue plans early. Some people may ask, what if the prediction and the actual situation are different? I think that people's subjective understanding is always different from the actual situation, and the so-called balance can only be a temporary balance, and the balance problem cannot be viewed in isolation and fixedly. Matters that are not well predicted in the plan can be strengthened for inspection and adjusted in a timely manner. This kind of adjustment to individual departments and individual links is unavoidable, and compared with the losses caused by the long-term failure to issue the plan, there are still more advantages than disadvantages. Otherwise, even if the plan we have prepared is completely in line with the actual situation (which is actually impossible), what is the use if it cannot be issued to the grassroots units for implementation?

In order to overcome the large discrepancies between prediction and reality, and to cope with unexpected events in the process of plan implementation, a reserve system should also be established. When agriculture has a bumper harvest and the country has sufficient financial and material resources, a portion should be appropriately reserved, which can supplement the shortage of years with poor agricultural harvests. In this way, when determining the next year's plan, it is not necessary to consider too much the success or failure of the current year's agricultural harvest. At the same time, with reserves, the country's construction undertakings can still proceed according to plan in the event of storms, so as not to cause imbalances in economic life or to change plans halfway.

Second, planning agencies at all levels should strengthen cooperation and coordination. After the state plan is issued, the various ministries and provinces (cities) still need a certain amount of time to deploy it to the grassroots units. In order to shorten this time, the preparation of the plan must be carried out simultaneously from top to bottom. To carry out the plan simultaneously, we must communicate with each other. Generally speaking, the central organs have a better understanding of the overall balance of the country, and the various ministries and provinces (cities) have a better understanding of the actual needs of their departments. Therefore, by communicating information up and down through meetings or providing information in writing, the plans of the lower-level planning agencies can conform to the general guidelines and routes of the state, and the plans of the higher-level planning agencies can meet the needs of various departments, so that the plan preparation process can be shortened.

In addition, in order to overcome the phenomenon of slackness in the early stage and tightness in the later stage of basic construction work, corresponding measures must be taken for the construction problems at the beginning of the year. Because the time for the issuance of the state plan is always limited. The Soviet Union now has to issue the next year's plan in December. Even if our country's plan can be issued to the various ministries and provinces (cities) at the end of the year, it is still too late for the grassroots units to arrange work only after the plan is issued. In order to solve this problem, I believe that the various ministries and provinces (cities) can make arrangements in advance for some projects that continue to be constructed or completed in the current year, based on the control figures or the reported draft plan, before the state plan is issued. In this way, construction can continue to be carried out at the beginning of the plan year.

    基本建设计划能不能早些下达？
    严萃友
    我国有计划地进行基本建设已有四年多了，在基本建设工作中取得了巨大的成绩，第一个五年计划的基本建设投资额预计可以超额完成。但是根据历年基本建设计划执行的情况来看，基本建设工作还存在着一些问题和缺点，特别是计划下达迟的现象非常严重。1954年的计划，在当年6月下达，1955年计划4月才下达，1956年计划3月才下达，1957年计划本来在去年末下达了，但由于有些环节不平衡，至今年4月又重新下达。
    国家计划下达迟，各部、各省（市）就无法及早安排基本建设工作；当接到国家下达的任务后，经过研究平衡，再层层下达到基层，时间就更晚了，有的部门的计划甚至到当年第三季才正式下达到基层单位。由于基本建设计划下达迟，便造成了上半年特别是第一季度窝工，下半年特别是第四季度赶工。如1955年上半年仅完成全年投资额34.2％，其中第一季只完成10.7％，下半年则完成投资额65.8％，其中第四季占42％；1956年上半年完成34.6％，其中第一季只完成12％，下半年完成65.4％，其中第四季完成39.8％。
    基本建设工作的这种“春等、夏闲、秋忙、冬突击”的状态，给国家带来了不少浪费和损失。在窝工期间，建筑企业的生产能力不能充分发挥，多余的工人要暂时遣散或支付窝工费，因而使劳动生产率下降。赶工时又要大量增加工人。到第二年春，因任务不足又要窝工。赶工时增加工人，窝工时减少工人，造成了恶性的循环。同时在任务紧迫的情况下，往往会忽视施工准备工作，忽视工程质量和安全措施，使施工组织混乱，工程质量事故与安全事故增加。有些工程，因计划下达迟延误了施工季节，必须进行冬季施工，要多支付冬季施工费用。计划下达迟，有时还影响基本建设计划不能如期完成。因此，争取提前下达计划，具有非常重要的意义。
    为什么基本建设计划下达得迟呢？主要有两方面的原因：
    第一，国民经济错综复杂，基本建设指标与生产、事业、财政等各项指标互相制约着。基本建设的规模，不但取决于生产和事业发展的需要，同时决定于现有的生产水平，即决定于物力、财力的保证条件。我国还是一个农业国，国家财政收入直接或间接来自农业的比重很大，因之，农业的丰收或歉收，对安排基本建设计划有很大的影响。而目前农业生产还不能摆脱自然条件的限制，农业收成的好坏难于预料，只有到秋收后才能比较可靠地确定下来。农业收成确定后，才能计算财政收入，并根据积累与消费的比例，确定基本建设投资。这样，自然就影响了编制与下达计划的时间。
    第二个原因是我们在经济和文化建设方面缺乏经验，很多重要的经济问题都需要反复研究、反复平衡；对国内经济情况了解不够，平衡核算工作还缺乏一套完善的方法与科学的定额资料。因此，安排年度计划时，不得不走些弯路，多排方案，才能使计划接近实际。这样自然也就多花了时间，推迟了计划的下达。
    但是，我们决不能因此否定提前下达计划的可能。我们已有了几年编制计划的经验，把计划编制过程缩短一些，提前下达计划，是有条件的。有些同志认为要克服计划下达迟的缺点，最好改变计划年度（如以1957年7月1日至1958年6月30日为1957年计划年度）；或者提前下达部分指标。这些都不是有效的办法，而且是有困难的。我们认为，要提前下达计划，须从下列几点着手：
    第一、必须摆脱农业对安排基本建设计划的影响，改变等农业收成定财政收入，然后由财政收入定基本建设投资的作法。否则计划就永远不能提前下达。我们国家大，各地区的自然条件不一，农作物的种类也多，就全国范围来说，虽然很难有全面丰收年，也不可能有全面歉收年。甲地受灾减产，乙地可能丰收增产；甲种农作物歉收，乙种农作物可能丰收。因之，丰收年、歉收年或平年的收获量，总有一个大体的规律。我们就可以根据过去几年的规律，预计本年度的农业收成，在预计的基础上早定财政收入，以便早定基本建设投资，早下达计划。有人也许要问，预计与实际发生出入怎么办呢？我认为，人的主观认识总是与实际有距离的，所谓平衡也只能是暂时的平衡，不能孤立地、固定地看待平衡问题。计划中预计不周的事，可以加强检查，及时调整。这种对个别部门、个别环节进行调整是难免的，而且与计划长期不能下达而造成的捐失相较，仍然利多弊少。否则，即令我们编出的计划完全合乎实际（这在实际上是不可能的），但不能下达到基层单位执行，又有什么作用呢？
    为了克服预计与实际的较大出入，为了应付计划执行过程中的意外事件，还应该建立储备制度。当农业丰收，国家财力、物力充足时，适当储备一部分，就可以补充农业歉收年的不足。这样，在确定下年度计划时，就不用过多的考虑当年农业收成的好坏了。同时，有了储备，还能使国家的建设事业在遇到风浪的情况下，仍然可以按计划进行，不致使经济生活发生失调现象或要中途变动计划。
    第二、各级计划机关要加强协作配合。国家计划下达后，各部、各省（市）布置到基层单位，仍需要一定的时间。为了缩短这段时间，计划的编制必须上下同时进行。而要同时进行，就必须互通声气。一般来说，中央机关对全国综合平衡情况比较了解，各部、各省（市）对本部门的实际需要比较了解。因此多通过会议或书面提供资料等方式，上下沟通情况，使下级计划机关的计划能符合国家总的方针路线，上级计划机关的计划能切合各部门需要，这样就能缩短计划的编制过程。
    另外，为克服基本建设工作前松后紧的现象，对年初的施工问题，必须采取相辅的措施。因为国家计划下达的时间总是有一定限度的，苏联现在也要在12月才下达下年度计划。就算我们国家的计划能在年底下达到各部、各省（市），但基层单位要等到计划下来才安排工作，还是晚了。为解决这个问题，我认为各部、各省（市）可以在国家计划未下达前，根据控制数字或上报计划草案，对某些继续施工或当年竣工的工程，事先做好安排，这样，计划年度一开始，就能继续进行施工了。
