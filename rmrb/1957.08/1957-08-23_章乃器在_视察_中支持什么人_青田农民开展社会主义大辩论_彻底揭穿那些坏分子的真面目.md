Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, August 22nd (By Xinhua News Agency reporter Yi Xintian): When rightist Zhang Naiqi "inspected" his hometown of Qingtian County, Zhejiang Province, last year, he incited the peasants by saying, "If you don't have enough grain and have opinions about the cooperatives, report it all to the 'Central Government'." Soon, many people in Qingtian County wrote letters to Zhang Naiqi, complaining about insufficient grain, demanding withdrawal from the cooperatives, and falsely accusing cadres.

What kind of people were those who wrote letters to Zhang Naiqi? Did they really lack grain? Recently, after the peasants of Qingtian County launched a great socialist debate, the truth about their grain complaints and demands for withdrawal from the cooperatives became clear.

The people who wrote to Zhang Naiqi shouted that they did not have enough grain and cursed the cooperatives and cadres, but after being exposed by the local peasants, it was discovered that they were generally surplus grain households. In the five townships of Dalu, Chuanliao, and Gaoshi alone, the sixteen households who wrote to Zhang Naiqi and whose cases were forwarded to the Qingtian County Party and government leading organs for processing, had a surplus of more than 11,000 jin of grain.

The eight households in Dalu Township who wrote to Zhang Naiqi have now been exposed as having surplus grain in every household, with four households having more than 1,000 jin of surplus grain. They sold their surplus grain at high prices on the black market, made fen gan (a type of noodle), made noodles, and engaged in speculative transactions. One household, Xia Yousong, even stored more than 300 jin of rice in the home of his relative, Chen Songlin. However, on the other hand, these people pretended to be poor and complained, and most of them did not pay their public grain in full, and they did not sell or sold very little of their surplus grain. Now, the peasants of the whole township are launching a reasoning struggle against these people.

Twenty-five households in Xiyuan Village, Gaoshi Township, jointly wrote to Zhang Naiqi, clamoring that they did not have enough rations. However, this village sold more than 10,000 jin of sweet potato dried goods to other places at high black market prices last year.

Three individual peasant households in Chuanliao Township wrote letters to Zhang Naiqi separately, recognizing Zhang Naiqi as their "dear cousin's husband" and "cousin brother," falsely accusing cadres of forcing them to starve to death. Recently, the peasants of this township exposed that these three households were all surplus grain households, and they owed a total of more than 2,000 jin of public grain and refused to sell surplus grain. Zhang Laijin, a landlord who was wrongly classified and recognized Zhang Naiqi as his "cousin brother," has refused to sell 1,660 jin of surplus grain and refused to pay more than 400 jin of public grain over the past three years. Last year, he rushed to Xiaoyuan Township to find Zhang Naiqi and stayed in Xiaoyuan Township for a day and a night. After returning to the village, he resolutely resisted the requisition of 400 jin of public grain and the purchase of 300 jin of surplus grain, and often went to the cooperative cadres to shout that he had no food to eat, and often used Zhang Naiqi's banner to threaten the cadres. Soon after, he wrote a letter to Zhang Naiqi falsely accusing the cadres. Was Zhang Laijin short of grain? Recently, the villagers exposed that he had more than 1,200 jin of surplus grain. In June of this year, he transported more than 90 jin of rice to Lishui County for black market speculation at a high price of three jin per yuan, and also used more than 70 jin of old grain to lend money at usurious rates to poor peasants such as Li Laibin, engaging in illegal exploitation. He also stole grain from the cooperative and frantically incited the members to withdraw from the cooperative. Now, the peasants of the whole township are launching a vigorous struggle against Zhang Laijin and demanding that the government punish him according to law.

The peasants of Gaohu, Xiaoyuan and other townships also exposed Zhang Naiqi's criminal acts of supporting active counter-revolutionaries and criminals in creating disturbances over grain and inciting withdrawal from the cooperatives. Shen Qiansong of Gaohu Township, who wrote six letters to Zhang Naiqi, turned out to be an organized counter-revolutionary. When Shen Qiansong learned that Zhang Naiqi had forwarded his letter to the local government for handling, he shouted, "Zhang Naiqi is supporting us," "Now there is a way." This counter-revolutionary became even more rampant, not only refusing to sell more than 200 jin of surplus grain, but also inciting the overthrow of the agricultural cooperative and plotting to beat up cadres. Ye Hengde of Xiaoyuan Township, who wrote a letter to Zhang Naiqi, received more than 1,500 jin of grain in the agricultural cooperative last year, and the government also supplied him with 84 jin of rice, which was enough for a family of four, but he still clamored for grain and withdrawal from the cooperative, colluding with counter-revolutionaries to beat eight cooperative cadres with hoes and machetes, and even conspired to kill the Communist Party branch secretary of the township and the head of the agricultural cooperative. This criminal, Ye Hengde, has now been arrested by the government according to law.

　　章乃器在“视察”中支持什么人
    青田农民开展社会主义大辩论
    彻底揭穿那些坏分子的真面目
    据新华社杭州22日电　新华社记者伊心恬报道：右派分子章乃器去年到他的家乡浙江省青田县“视察”的时候，煽动农民说：“你们粮食不够吃，对社有意见，统统告到“中央去”。不久，青田县就有很多人写信给章乃器，喊粮食不够，闹要退社，还诬告干部。
    写信给章乃器的是些什么样的人？他们的粮食是否不够吃？最近青田县农民开展社会主义大辩论后，这些人闹粮食、闹退社的真相就大白了。
    写信给章乃器的人大喊粮食不够吃，骂合作社，骂干部，可是经过当地农民揭发，发现他们普遍是余粮户。仅大路、船寮、高市等五个乡，写信给章乃器被章乃器批转到青田县党政领导机关处理的十六户，就有余粮一万一千多斤。
    大路乡写信给章乃器的八户，现在被揭发出家家都有余粮，其中有四户余粮在一千斤以上。他们把余粮高价卖黑市，做粉干，做面条，进行投机交易。有一户叫夏有松，还把三百多斤大米存放在他的亲戚陈松林家里。可是另一方面，这些人却装穷叫苦，公粮大多没有缴清，余粮也不卖或少卖。现在全乡农民正在同这些人展开说理斗争。
    高市乡西源村有二十五户联名写信给章乃器，叫喊口粮不够。但是这个村子去年运到外地以黑市高价出卖的蕃薯干就有一万多斤。
    船寮乡有三户单干农民分别写信给章乃器，认章乃器做“亲表妹丈”、“堂兄弟”，诬告干部迫使他们要饿死。最近这个乡农民揭发出这三户都是余粮户，他们共欠公粮、拒卖余粮两千多斤。认章乃器做“堂兄弟”的漏划地主章来进，三年来拒卖余粮一千六百六十斤，拒交公粮四百多斤。去年他赶到小源乡去找章乃器，在小源乡住了一天一夜。回村后，他就对应缴的公粮四百斤和应购的余粮三百斤坚决抗拒征购，还常常到社干部那里叫喊没有粮食吃了，动不动拿出章乃器的招牌来威胁干部。不久他又写信给章乃器诬告干部。章来进是不是粮食不够吃？最近村里农民揭发出他有余粮一千二百多斤。今年6月，他运出大米九十多斤到丽水县以每元三斤的高价进行黑市投机买卖，还用七十多斤陈谷向贫农厉来彬等放高利贷，进行非法剥削。他还偷窃社里粮食，疯狂地煽动社员闹退社。现在，全乡农民正大张旗鼓地和章来进进行斗争，并要求政府依法加以惩处。
    高湖、小源等乡的农民还揭发了章乃器支持现行反革命分子和犯罪分子闹粮食、闹退社的罪恶行为。连写了六封信给章乃器的高湖乡的沈钱松，原来是一个有组织的反革命分子。当沈钱松知道章乃器把他的信批转到当地政府处理后，他就大喊“章乃器替我们撑腰了”，“现在有办法了”。这个反革命分子更加猖狂，不但拒卖余粮两百多斤，还煽动搞垮农业社，图谋殴打干部。小源乡有一个写信给章乃器的叶恒德，去年在农业社里分到一千五百多斤粮食，政府还供应他八十四斤大米，一家四人足够吃，可是他还猖狂地闹粮食，闹退社，勾结反革命分子带着锄头、柴刀殴打了八个社干部，还阴谋打死中共乡支部书记和农业社社长。这个犯罪分子叶恒德现在已由政府依法予以逮捕。
