Xinhua News Agency, Manama, August 10th: According to British official announcements, the British Air Force dispatched two "Shackleton" bombers this morning, dropping 104 twenty-pound fragmentation bombs on the Firk area. Subsequently, "Venom" jet fighters strafed the area with rockets and machine guns in an attempt to force the Omani insurgents, who had repelled the British attacking forces yesterday, to submit.

Under the strong resistance of the Omani insurgents, the British attacking forces were forced to retreat approximately six miles from the outskirts of Firk on August 9th, withdrawing to the village of Kercha, about eleven miles south of Nizwa, the insurgents' headquarters. British military sources admitted that the Omani insurgents' resistance was "greater than expected," and their accuracy of fire and troop deployment were unexpected. Prior to this, the British military had stated in advance that they were confident of occupying Firk on the same day.

According to reports from London, news of the British army's setback in Firk, Oman, has become the headline story in almost all British newspapers today. British newspapers and magazines are worried that if the war is prolonged, the Oman incident will become a "very troublesome international event."

The "News Chronicle" and the "Daily Mail" used the headlines "Blow in the Date Palm Grove Battle" and "Setback in the Desert" to report the British army's failure. The "Daily Herald" quoted a British spokesperson in Oman as saying that the Omani insurgents' officers' command ability greatly exceeded the British's estimation of them.

In recent days, some British newspapers and magazines have been clamoring for a quick victory in Oman. The "New Statesman" wants Britain to take action "before Arab countries accuse it at the United Nations." It also stated that "slow" military action would give world public opinion time to mobilize and accuse Britain of carrying out aggression.

    英军在阿曼菲尔克受挫
    英报大起恐慌担心夜长梦多
    据新华社10日讯　马纳马消息：据英国官方公布，英国空军今天上午出动两架“沙克莱顿式”轰炸机，在菲尔克地区投下二十磅重的杀伤弹一百零四枚，随后又出动“毒液式”喷气式战斗机以火箭和机关枪向这个地区扫射，以图迫使昨天击退了英国进攻部队的阿曼起义者屈服。
    在阿曼起义者的强烈抗击下，英国进攻部队8月9日被迫从菲尔克郊外后退约六英里，退至离开起义者总部所在地尼兹瓦以南约十一英里的克尔沙村。英国军方承认，阿曼起义者的抵抗力“比预料的要大”，他们射击的准确和部队的部署都出乎意料。在这之前，英国军方曾经在事先表示有把握在当天就占领菲尔克。
    据伦敦消息：英国军队在阿曼菲尔克受挫的消息，几乎成为英国今天所有报纸的头条新闻。英国报刊担心，战争延长下去，阿曼事件将会变成“十分令人头痛的国际事件”。
      “新闻纪事报”和“每日邮报”用“枣椰林战斗中的打击”、“沙漠里的挫折”的标题，报道了英军的失败情形。“每日先驱报”引用英国在阿曼的发言人的话说，阿曼起义军队军官的指挥能力大大超过了英国对他们的估计。
    几天来，英国一些报纸杂志正在嚷嚷要在阿曼速战速决。“新政治家”要英国“不等阿拉伯国家在联合国控告它”就采取行动。它并且说，军队行动“迟缓”，就会使世界舆论有时间动员起来指责英国是在进行侵略。
