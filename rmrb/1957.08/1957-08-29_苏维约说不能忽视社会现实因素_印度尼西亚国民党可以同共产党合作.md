　　Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 28th: Jakarta newspapers reported today that Sukarno, Chairman of the Indonesian National Party (PNI), said in Yogyakarta on August 26th that he believes the PNI can cooperate with the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) and other political parties, but cooperation must be carried out "without harming the PNI."

　　Sukarno said that some people accuse the PNI's attitude as opportunistic, but the PNI believes this is "only natural" because the PNI cannot ignore the "real factors" in society.

　　Sukarno said that the PNI agrees to conduct consultations to solve local problems because this is a suggestion made by the cabinet that the PNI supports. He reiterated that the PNI still supports the current cabinet.

　　Sukarno and Sayuti Melik, a member of the PNI Central Committee, went to Yogyakarta to deal with the issue of the Yogyakarta PNI branch and two parties, including the Indonesian Communist Party, reaching an agreement on cooperation in the local council elections. The organizations of these three parties in Yogyakarta had agreed to allocate the remaining odd-number votes after the distribution of council seats to the party with the largest odd-number. However, the PNI Central Committee considered this a "major issue" and ordered its Yogyakarta branch to cancel the agreement.

　　Sukarno said at a press conference on the 26th that the PNI Central Committee's order to the Yogyakarta branch to cancel the cooperation agreement "does not mean that the PNI absolutely denies PNI-PKI cooperation."

　　The meeting of the Central Committee of the National Party has ended on the 24th. This important meeting discussed the issue of cooperation between the National Party and the Indonesian Communist Party and other political parties. The results of the meeting were not announced.

　  苏维约说不能忽视社会现实因素
　　印度尼西亚国民党可以同共产党合作
    据新华社雅加达28日电　据雅加达报纸今天报道，印度尼西亚国民党总主席苏维约8月26日在日惹发表谈话说，他认为国民党可以同印度尼西亚共产党和其他政党合作，但是必须在“不损害国民党”的条件下进行合作。
    苏维约说，有人指责国民党的上述态度是投机的，但是国民党认为这是“理所当然”的，因为国民党不能忽视社会中的“现实因素”。
    苏维约说，国民党同意进行协商以解决地方问题，因为这是国民党所支持的内阁提出的意见。他重申国民党仍然支持现内阁。
    苏维约和国民党中央委员沙尤提·默利到日惹去，是为了处理日惹国民党支部和印度尼西亚共产党等两个党派就地方议会选举中进行合作而达成协议的问题。这三个党派在日惹的组织曾经同意把分配议员席位以后剩余的尾数选票归并给尾数最大的政党。但是国民党中央认为这是一个“重大问题”，曾经命令它的日惹支部取消这个协议。
    苏维约在26日举行的记者招待会上说，国民党中央命令日惹支部取消这项合作协议，“并不表示国民党绝对否定国共合作”。
    国民党中央委员会的会议已经在24日结束，这个重要的会议讨论了国民党和印度尼西亚共产党以及其他政党的合作问题。会议结果没有公布。
