Xinhua News Agency, 14th - The people of the Northwest provinces will further develop soil and water conservation work on the Loess Plateau with the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Moved the Mountain. The first meeting convened by the National Soil and Water Conservation Committee – the Symposium on Soil and Water Conservation in the Middle Reaches of the Yellow River – according to the instructions of the State Council, studied how to strengthen soil and water conservation work in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, to increase agricultural production in this region, improve people's lives, and ensure and extend the design life of the Sanmenxia Reservoir.

The symposium began on August 3rd and ended on the 13th. More than 100 representatives from Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, and Henan provinces, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, and relevant central agencies attended.

According to calculations made at the meeting: as a result of controlling soil erosion on the Loess Plateau in the four provinces during the Second and Third Five-Year Plans, by 1967, grain production can be increased by more than 2.95 billion jin, and sediment into the Yellow River can be reduced by more than 480 million tons. This accounts for 41% of the total annual sediment transport of the four provinces and 35.6% of the sediment transport of the Yellow River in Shanzhou.

The meeting believed that practical experience of the past few years has proven that the working principle of "overall planning, comprehensive development, combining slope and gully treatment, and centralized management" for soil and water conservation is correct. That is to say, comprehensive measures must be taken in all aspects of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and water conservancy, and close cooperation is required to achieve significant results in increasing production and intercepting sediment. Soil erosion on the slopes of the Loess Plateau is the root cause of soil and water loss, so treatment should focus on slopes, combined with gully treatment, taking small catchment areas as units, from top to bottom, from small to large, concentrating on slope-by-slope and gully-by-gully management, combined with the current interests of the masses. The method of governance should start from production, with agriculture as the main focus, developing diverse economies, and carrying out comprehensive management. Cultivation techniques should be combined with field projects on the slopes to retain water and soil in the farmland as much as possible.

The meeting believed that soil and water conservation work on the Loess Plateau had achieved certain results in the past, and the four provinces had already controlled soil erosion over an area of 69,840 square kilometers. More importantly, the masses have created many soil and water conservation methods that are adapted to local conditions and have significant effects. In the future, these experiences must be further summarized and promoted.

The meeting put forward specific progress and arrangements for how to complete this arduous and glorious task in a step-by-step manner: The total area of soil erosion in the Yellow River basin reaches 580,000 square kilometers. The above-mentioned four provinces account for 404,000 square kilometers, and the total annual sediment flowing into the Yellow River from the four provinces is 1.138 billion tons. Based on the calculation that rural labor in the four provinces used for soil and water conservation work accounts for about 8%, there will be more than 1.2 billion labor days available for soil and water conservation from 1958 to 1967. By 1967, about 180,000 square kilometers of soil erosion can be controlled again, thereby achieving the above-mentioned goals of increasing production and intercepting sediment. The meeting believed that this progress should be slow at first and then fast, from point to area. According to the labor situation in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, to complete the task of comprehensively and basically controlling soil erosion, accounting for about 50% of the total area, it will take about 20 years in areas with better labor conditions, about 30 years in areas with fewer people accounting for about 40%, and more than 40 years in sparsely populated areas accounting for about 10%.

The meeting also made more detailed discussions and put forward suggestions on establishing soil and water conservation work organizations at all levels, the use of funds, the formulation of a ten-year soil and water conservation plan for the middle reaches of the Yellow River and soil and water conservation plans for agricultural cooperatives, the training and allocation of soil and water conservation work cadres, the establishment of pilot projects to promote overall work, and various policies related to soil and water conservation work.

The meeting called on Party committees and governments at all levels in the four provinces to rely on the broad masses of people, with the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Moved the Mountain, to complete this great and arduous task persistently over several five-year plans, turn poor mountains into rich mountains, and gradually make the river water clear.

    使穷山变富  让黄河变清
    黄河中游水土保持座谈会讨论了具体办法
    新华社14日讯  西北各省将以愚公移山的精神，进一步开展黄土高原的水土保持工作。全国水土保持委员会成立后召开的第一次会议——黄河中游水土保持座谈会，根据国务院的指示，研究了如何加强黄河中游水土保持工作，以增加这个地区农业生产，改善人民生活并确保和延长三门峡水库的设计寿命。
    这个座谈会是8月3日开始的，13日结束了。出席的有陕西、甘肃、山西、河南四省和黄河水利委员会的代表和中央有关机关的代表共一百多人。
    根据会议的计算：第二个五年计划和第三个五年计划期间，四省黄土高原控制水土流失的结果，到1967年可增产原粮二十九亿五千多万斤，减少黄河泥沙四亿八千多万吨。占四省年总输沙量的41％，占陕州黄河输沙量的35.6％。
    会议认为：经过几年的实践证明：“全面规划、综合开发、坡沟兼治、集中治理”的水土保持工作方针是正确的。就是说要从农业、林业、牧业、水利各方面采取综合措施，并且密切配合，才能收到增产和拦泥的显著效果。而黄土地区坡面上的土壤侵蚀是水土流失的根源，所以应该以治坡为主结合治沟，以小的集水面积为单位从上至下、由小到大，成坡成沟的集中治理，结合群众当前的利益来进行。治理的方法应从生产出发，以农业为主，发展多种经济，进行综合治理。在坡面上进行耕作技术配合田间工程，把水土尽量拦在农田里。
    会议认为：过去黄土高原的水土保持工作有一定成绩，四省已经控制了水土流失的面积为六万九千八百四十平方公里。而更主要的是群众创造了很多的因地制宜、效果显著的保持水土办法。今后须进一步总结和发扬这些经验。
    会议对怎样有步骤地完成这一艰巨而光荣的任务，提出了具体进度和安排的建议：黄河流域水土流失面积共达五十八万平方公里。上述四省为四十万零四千平方公里，四省总计每年流入黄河的泥沙为十一亿三千八百万吨。根据四省农村劳力用于水土保持工约占8％计算，1958年到1967年可有十二亿多个劳动日用于水土保持，这样到1967年可再控制十八万左右平方公里的水土流失。从而作到上述增产和拦泥的目标。会议认为这个进度应先慢后快、由点到面。而根据黄河中游劳力情况，要完成全面基本控制水土流失任务，约占总面积50％，劳动力的条件较好地区需二十年左右的时间，约占40％的人少地区需三十年左右，约占10％的人口稀少地区需四十年以上。
    会议还对建立各级水土保持工作机构、经费使用、制订黄河中游十年水土保持规划及农业社的水土保持规划、培养和配备水土保持工作干部、建立试点推动全面、有关水土保持工作的各项政策等也作了较详细的讨论，提出了建议。
    会议要求四省各级党和政府依靠广大群众，本着愚公移山的精神，坚持不懈地经过几个五年计划来完成这个伟大艰巨任务，把穷山变成富山，并使河水逐渐变清。
