To Develop the Raw Materials Industry Quickly and Economically
Jiangsu Province Opens Fourteen New Small Mines
    (Report from this newspaper) Jiangsu Province's local mining industry is developing faster this year than in any previous year. More than fourteen new small mines have been opened in the first half of the year. The total output value of the province's local mining industry in the first half of this year is equivalent to 1.42 times the total output value for the entire year of 1955. Iron ore production increased by 3.39 times compared with the same period last year, and has completed the target of the first Five-Year Plan more than seven months ahead of schedule. It is estimated that this year's output can reach 300,000 tons, which is equivalent to three times the target stipulated in the first Five-Year Plan. Anthracite production has also increased by 47 times compared with the same period last year. The output of manganese ore, quartz, porcelain clay, pottery clay, and various industrial quartz sand, limestone, dolomite, etc. has also increased significantly. In addition, new mines for copper, lead, zinc, etc. have also been opened.
    After leading cadres of local industrial departments went deep into the mountains to lead the masses in finding mines, and geological and mining personnel actively carried out exploration and investigation, more than ten medium and small mines with industrial value have been discovered or preliminarily confirmed in various places. For example, the Yangshan kaolin mine, with preliminary estimates of reserves in only the east and west working areas, can supply a mining enterprise with an annual output of 200,000 tons of concentrate for about 25 years of mining. Small iron ore deposits in Gaozi and Xiashu are widely distributed and of good quality, which can be used for open-hearth steelmaking.
    According to the principle of small investment and high return, in addition to opening a dozen new small mines, the industrial leading departments in various places have also expanded the mining of most of the existing mines; some old mine pits that were mined in the past and later abandoned have also been re-mined after being reorganized.

    又快又省地发展原材料工业
    江苏省新开十四处小矿
    本报讯　江苏省今年的地方采矿工业发展速度超过了以往任何一年。上半年新开小矿十四处以上。全省地方矿业今年上半年的产值，相当于1955年全年生产总值的一点四二倍。铁矿石产量比去年同期增长三点三九倍，并已提前七个多月完成了第一个五年计划的指标，预计今年产量可以达到三十万吨，相当于第一个五年计划规定指标的三倍。烟煤产量，也比去年同期增长四十七倍。锰矿、石英、瓷土、陶土和各种工业用石英沙、石灰石、白云石等的产量，也都有显著增长。此外还新开了铜、铅、锌等矿。
    经过各地工业部门领导人员深入山区带领群众找矿，地质、采矿人员积极进行勘探调查，各地发现或初步证实的具有工业价值的中、小型矿，共有十多处。如阳山高岭土矿，仅东、西两个工区初步估计，储量即可供一个年产精矿二十万吨的矿山企业开采二十五年左右。高资、下蜀一带小型铁矿分布既广，质量又好，可供平炉炼钢使用。
    各地工业领导部门根据投资少、收效大的方针，除新开十几处小矿以外，还将原有的大部分矿山扩大了开采；有些以往开采过后来又废弃了的矿坑，经过整理以后，也重新开采。
