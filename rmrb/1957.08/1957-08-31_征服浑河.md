　　Conquering the Hun River

    Since the dam of the Dahuofang Reservoir was entirely raised to an elevation of 127 meters, people's desire to conquer the Hun River has been basically close to realized.
    This dam, which was recently raised and stands majestically on the Hun River, blocked the first dangerous flood peak of this year's rainy season on August 1st – the water level was as high as 107.5 meters.
    People still remember the flood peak of over 100 meters in 1954, which submerged many villages close to the riverbank and overflowed the Zhangdang Village Bridge, cutting off the Shenyang-Jilin Railway. Now, more than 120 million cubic meters of floodwater has been tamed and stored in the artificial lake. Although the water surface is more than five zhang (approximately 16.7 meters) higher than the riverbed, the reservoir's diversion channel is normally discharging at a flow rate of 282 cubic meters per second.
    Underneath the Zhangdang Bridge, which was once submerged by the flood, there is not only no water accumulation, but people can also see the bustling scene of the vegetable free market there. People seem to be unaware that the floodwater has risen above the houses, and the shops on the street are still receiving a large number of customers.
    The Hun River, a major tributary of the Liao River, has a high source and rapid flow, and a narrow and steep riverbed. Every rainy season, mountain floods break out and rush down, seriously threatening the safety of the two major industrial cities of Shenyang and Fushun, as well as the nearby rural areas. In order to conquer this river, in November 1953, the Party and the government began construction here of this reservoir with a storage capacity of 1.97 billion cubic meters. The 1,367-meter-long dam, which is now starting to hold back floodwater, is the largest earth dam in China's current water conservancy projects. In order to hold back floodwater earlier, the people building the reservoir had already invested in even more intensive labor after the dam "closed" in October last year. In days when the temperature was as low as minus ten degrees Celsius, in order to fill 100,000 cubic meters of river sand as soon as possible, they built an unprecedented "mountain-making workshop" in the river valley in water conservancy engineering. This was a large warm shed, supplied with warm air by boilers, seven stories high, more than sixty meters wide, and more than three hundred meters long. River sand and clay were supplied here continuously to meet the needs of filling the earth dam.
    After more than three years of construction, now, standing on the top of this more than ten-meter-wide flat dam, you can see the vast artificial lake unfolding before people's eyes. The tall dam will continue to be raised to 138 meters next year, so that even if the Hun River encounters a once-in-a-millennium flood, it will not be able to cross the top of the dam. Here, one cannot help but recall the events of more than twenty years ago. At that time, the Hun River once flooded more than 1,000 mu of land, causing more than 300,000 farmers to be displaced. Today, the breeze rises, and the waves by the lake gently splash against the dam, while the roaring flood has been tamed by the people of New China.

　　征服浑河
　　文中
    自从大伙房水库的拦河坝全部升高到一百二十七公尺高程以后，人们征服浑河的愿望算是基本上接近实现了。
    这座不久前才升高起来的、巍然屹立在浑河上的拦河坝，它在8月1日拦住了今年雨季第一个——水位高达一百零七点五公尺——凶险的洪峰。
    人们还记得1954年暴涨的一百多公尺的洪峰，曾经淹没紧靠河岸的许多村庄，曾经漫过了章党村大桥，断绝了沈吉铁路。而今，一亿二千多万立方公尺的洪水已经被驯服地拦蓄到人工湖里。尽管水面比河床高出五丈多，而水库的输水道却以每秒二百八十二公尺的流量正常地向下流泄。
    当年曾被洪水淹没的章党大桥下，不仅没有积水，人们还可以看到那里的蔬菜自由市场上，熙熙攘攘。人们就像还不知道洪水已经高过房子似的，街上的商店仍在接待着大批顾客。
    浑河，这是运河的一条大支流，源高流急，河床狭陡。年年雨季，山洪暴发，奔腾而下，严重地威胁着沈阳、抚顺两大工业城市和附近农村的安全。为了征服这条河流，1953年11月，党和政府开始在这里动工兴建这个储水量十九亿七千万立方公尺的水库。现在开始拦洪的一千三百六十七公尺长的拦河坝，是我国目前水利工程中最大的一座土坝。为了更早地拦住洪水，建设水库的人们早在去年10月河坝“合龙”以后，就已投入了更加紧张的劳动。在气温低到零下十多度的日子里，他们为了尽快填筑十万立方公尺的河沙，在河谷里建造了一座水利工程中史无前例的“造山车间”。这是一个由锅炉输送暖气，七层楼高、六十多公尺宽、三百多公尺长的大暖棚。河沙、粘土通过这里，源源供应了填筑土坝的需要。
    经过三年多时间的建设，现在，站在这座十多公尺宽的平坦的坝顶上，可以看到宽广的人工湖展现在人们的眼前。高大的水坝还要在明年继续向一百三十八公尺加高，它要使浑河遇到了千年一度的洪水也无法越过坝顶。在这里，不禁使人想起二十多年前的往事。那时，浑河曾经淹没过一千多亩土地，使三十多万农民流离失所。如今，微风扬起，湖边的浪花轻轻地拍溅着水坝，咆哮的洪水却被新中国的人民驯服了。
