Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, August 9th: Ten thousand young workers and children of workers and peasants across Romania are actively brushing up on their studies, preparing to take entrance exams for institutions of higher education. These refresher courses are organized by local factories and People's Councils, with teachers from middle schools and institutions of higher education providing instruction.

This year, Romanian institutions of higher education will universally enroll a group of workers and children of workers and peasants, with a total quota of more than three thousand people. These individuals will enjoy stipends provided by factories and regional People's Councils. Before enrollment, they will also sign contracts with the departments providing the stipends, guaranteeing that they will return to work in the units that provided them with the stipends after graduation.

Originally, children of workers and peasants only accounted for 20% to 25% of the total student population in Romanian institutions of higher education. This year, this proportion will undergo a significant change, with the worker and peasant component of new students increasing to approximately 50%. In about five years, the ratio of workers and children of workers and peasants in the entire higher education student body should reach about 50%.

In addition to guaranteeing that young workers and children of workers and peasants enter regular institutions of higher education, the Romanian government will also establish worker's night universities and worker's correspondence schools.

Currently, children of workers and peasants account for approximately 50% of the student population in secondary schools. This year, children of workers and peasants will account for 60% to 70% of the newly enrolled students.

    罗马尼亚大批工人和工农子弟
    积极备课投考高等学校
    新华社布加勒斯特9日电　罗马尼亚全国有一万名青年工人和工农子弟正在积极补习功课，准备投考高等学校。补习班是由各地工厂和人民会议举办的，由中学和高等学校的教师们教课。
    罗马尼亚各高等学校今年将普遍招收一批工人和工农子弟入学，总名额是三千多人。这些人将享受工厂和州人民会议发给他们的助学金。他们在入学前并且将同供给助学金的部门签订合同，保证毕业后分别回到发给他们助学金的单位去工作。
    罗马尼亚高等学校学生中的工农子弟原来只占学生总数的20％—25％。今年这个比例将有很大改变，入学新生中的工农成分将提高到50％左右。大约五年以后，工人和工农子弟在全部高等学校学生中的比率就可以达到50％左右。
    罗马尼亚政府除保证青年工人和工农子弟进入正规的高等学校以外，还将举办工人夜大学和工人函授学校。
    目前在中等学校里，工农子弟约占50％左右。今年招考的新生，工农子弟将占60％到70％。
