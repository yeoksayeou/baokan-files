Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, August 26th: Hundreds of thousands of people in Bulgaria held a grand rally on Mount Shipka in the Tarnovo region on August 25th to solemnly commemorate the 80th anniversary of Bulgaria's liberation from Turkish oppression with the help of the Russian army.

　　First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, Zhivkov, said in his speech at the meeting that eighty years ago (when the Russo-Turkish War was in progress), on the peaks of Shipka, the heroic Russian army and Bulgarian self-defense forces used blood to write a glorious page in the heroic history of the two peoples. They used their blood to develop the great brotherly friendship between Russia and Bulgaria. Zhivkov also thanked the Romanian people on behalf of the Bulgarian people, because the sons and daughters of Romania had fought side by side with the Russian and Bulgarian armies.

　　When talking about the current international situation, Zhivkov said that the will of the people of all countries to strive for peace is irresistible. The enemies of socialism are attempting to undermine the unity of the socialist camp countries and weaken Bulgaria's relations with the Soviet Union, but all efforts in this regard are in vain.

　　Subsequently, the head of the Soviet government delegation, Gondoev, chairman of the Soviet Slavic Committee, and the head of the Romanian government delegation, Lieutenant General Jacklu, Deputy Minister of the Romanian Armed Forces, spoke at the meeting successively.

　　After the speeches, a grand military parade was held. A team composed of naval and army units first passed the reviewing stand. Then silver jet fighters swept across the sky. Applause and cheers resounded throughout the mountains.

　　Also attending the commemorative meeting that day were Prime Minister Grotewohl of the German Democratic Republic, who was on vacation in Bulgaria, the Albanian parliamentary delegation, which was visiting Bulgaria, and diplomatic envoys from the Soviet Union and other countries to Bulgaria.

    纪念从土耳其压迫下解放八十周年
　　保加利亚人民举行隆重集会
    新华社索非亚26日电　保加利亚有数十万群众8月25日在第尔诺夫州的什布卡山上举行集会，隆重纪念保加利亚在俄国军队的帮助下从土耳其压迫下解放八十周年。
    保共中央第一书记日夫科夫在会上致词说，八十年前（按当时正是俄土战争进行的时候），就是在什布卡的山峰上，英勇的俄国军队和保加利亚自卫军用鲜血在两国人民的英雄历史上写下了光辉的一页。他们用自己的鲜血开拓了伟大的俄保两国的兄弟友谊。日夫科夫还代表保加利亚人向罗马尼亚人民表示感谢，因为罗马尼亚的子弟兵曾经同俄保两国军队并肩作战。
    日夫科夫在谈到当前的国际局势问题的时候说，各国人民争取和平的意志是不可抗拒的。社会主义的敌人企图破坏社会主义阵营国家的团结一致以及削弱保加利亚同苏联的关系，但是这方面的一切努力都是徒然的。
    接着，苏联政府代表团团长、苏联斯拉夫委员会主席冈多罗夫，罗马尼亚政府代表团长、罗马尼亚武装部队部副部长杰克鲁上将在会上相继讲了话。
    讲话结束以后，就举行了盛大的军事检阅。由海军和陆军部队组成的队伍首先通过检阅台。接着是银色喷气歼击机掠空而过。满山遍野都响起了掌声和欢呼声。
    出席这一天纪念大会的还有正在保加利亚度假的德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥、正在保加利亚访问的阿尔巴尼亚议会代表团，以及苏联和其他国家驻保加利亚的外交使节。（附图片）
