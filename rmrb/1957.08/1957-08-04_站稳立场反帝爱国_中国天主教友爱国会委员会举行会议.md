Xinhua News Agency, August 3rd: The Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association Committee held its first meeting today. The committee members unanimously expressed at the meeting that they will never fail the expectations of the more than three million Catholics nationwide. They will firmly stand on the position of the Chinese people and lead the clergy and laity throughout the country to carry out the anti-imperialist and patriotic movement more deeply.

The meeting proposed that resolute exposure and criticism of the erroneous words and deeds of right-wing elements within the Catholic Church must be carried out. Through reasoned debate, right and wrong must be distinguished, and all obstacles on the road to patriotism and love of the church must be eliminated. In this way, the clergy and laity throughout the country can be more united and work together to build a socialist motherland and manage the church well.

The meeting elected the Chairman, Vice-Chairmen, Secretary-General, Deputy Secretaries-General, and Standing Committee members of the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association.

Pi Shushi, Archbishop of the Shenyang Archdiocese in Liaoning, was elected Chairman of the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association. Yang Shida (Deputy Director of the Shanghai Catholic Patriotic Association), Li Boyu (Bishop of the Zhouzhi Diocese in Shaanxi), Li Weiguang (Acting Bishop of the Nanjing Diocese in Jiangsu), Wang Wencheng (Bishop of the Nanchong Diocese in Sichuan), Zhao Zhensheng (Bishop of the Xianxian Diocese in Hebei), Dong Wenlong (Acting Bishop of the Jinan Diocese in Shandong), Li Depei (Priest of the Tianjin Diocese), and Cao Daosheng (Deputy Director of the Taiyuan Catholic Patriotic Association in Shanxi) were elected Vice-Chairmen.
