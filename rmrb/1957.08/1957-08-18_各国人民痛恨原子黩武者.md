Xinhua News Agency, August 17th: According to TASS, Oslo: "Friheten" published the Norwegian Communist Party's election platform on August 16th. The platform points out that the main task of the Norwegian working people in the parliamentary elections on October 7th is to reduce the representation of bourgeois parties in the parliament; to lay the foundation for a new socialist line in Norway's policies; and to elect more Communist members to strengthen the workers' majority in the parliament.

The Norwegian Communist Party advocates: foreign countries are not allowed to establish military bases or store atomic weapons on Norwegian territory; all kinds of weapons of mass destruction should be prohibited; disarmament should be implemented; full employment should be guaranteed for domestic workers; the wages of working people should be increased; income tax on labor should be reduced; and private banks, insurance companies, and large industrial enterprises should be nationalized.

The Norwegian Communist Party points out that the fate of Norway should be decided by the people themselves. The primary task of Norway's independent foreign policy should be to promote the relaxation of international tensions and ensure world peace, and this task can only be achieved by dissolving all military blocs and withdrawing troops stationed in other countries and canceling bases established in other countries.

British Shipbuilding and Mechanical Engineering Workers' Union
Demands a Complete Ban on Nuclear Weapons

Xinhua News Agency, August 17th: London News: The annual meeting of the British Shipbuilding Workers and Mechanical Industry Workers' Union Federation has closed on August 16th. The annual meeting passed a series of resolutions demanding increased wages and reduced working hours, and also demanded a ban on nuclear weapons.

The representatives unanimously passed a resolution at the meeting instructing the executive committee to submit a new demand for increased wages at an "appropriate time." This hit the right-wing leaders of the union, who promised the employers not to demand increased wages within a year during the general strike of shipbuilding and machine workers this spring.

The representatives unanimously passed a resolution at the meeting, calling for a halt to the production and testing of nuclear weapons, and demanding the destruction of existing weapons of this kind.

The annual meeting passed a draft resolution proposed by Mortimer of the Machine Manufacturing and Shipbuilding Industry Drawing Employees' Union and Simpson of the Foundry Workers' Union, demanding the immediate nationalization of the machine manufacturing and aircraft manufacturing industries.

    各国人民痛恨原子黩武者
    挪共号召人民行动起来
    反对外国在挪设立基地
    新华社17日讯  据塔斯社奥斯陆讯：“自由报”8月16日发表了挪威共产党的竞选纲领。纲领指出，挪威劳动人民在10月7日举行的议会选举中的主要任务是：减少资产阶级政党在议会中的代表；在挪威的政策方面奠定新的、社会主义路线的基础；选出更多的共产党议员来加强议会中的工人多数派。
    挪威共产党主张：不许外国在挪威领土上建立军事基地和存放原子武器；禁止各种大规模毁灭性武器；实行裁军；保证国内工人完全就业；提高劳动人民的工资；降低劳动所得税；把私人的银行、保险公司以及大工业企业收归国有。
    挪威共产党指出，挪威的命运应当由人民自己来决定。挪威的独立外交政策的首要任务，应该是促使国际紧张局势缓和及保证世界和平，而只有解散所有军事集团以及各国撤退驻在别国的军队和取消设在别国的基地，这一任务才能实现。
    英造船和机械工会
    要求完全禁止核武器
    据新华社17日讯  伦敦消息：英国造船工人及机械工业工人工会联合会年会已经在8月16日闭幕，年会通过了一系列关于要求增加工资和缩短工时的决议，并且要求禁止核武器。
    代表们在会上一致通过了责成执行委员会在“适当时间”提出增加工资的新要求的决议。这就打击了工会的右翼领袖，他们在今年春季造船和机器工人总罢工时答应企业主在一年内不提出增加工资的要求。
    代表们在会上一致通过决议，号召停止生产和试验核武器，并且要求销毁现存的这种武器。
    年会通过了机器制造和造船业绘图员工会的摩蒂默和翻砂工人联合会的辛普生提出的一项决议草案，要求机器制造业和飞机制造业立即实行国有化。
