Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 17th: In the short eight years since liberation, 800,000 people in Shanghai have found employment, of whom more than 200,000 are now participating in national construction in various parts of the country. Among the 530,000 employed in Shanghai itself, 460,000 are in the industrial sector.

According to statistics, by the end of last year, the total number of employed people in Shanghai had reached 2.39 million, with an average of one in three people working.

Shanghai was once the city with the largest unemployed population in the country. Since liberation, the city has registered a cumulative total of more than 671,000 unemployed people, of whom 423,000 were unemployed people left over from before liberation. In recent years, the Communist Party and the People's Government have adopted various measures to help the unemployed create employment conditions, enabling the vast majority of those who met the employment conditions to take up jobs. Some of them have engaged in agricultural production, and others have supported construction projects in other parts of the country, greatly alleviating the unemployment problem in Shanghai. By the end of 1956, the number of unemployed people who had registered with the labor departments but had not yet found employment had been reduced to more than 126,000, of whom about half were housewives engaged in domestic labor, as well as small traders and peddlers and people engaged in seasonal work. In fact, there was no need to arrange work for this group of people separately.

At present, in addition to a certain number of unemployed people in Shanghai, the newly emerging labor force in need of employment is increasing year by year. According to the national economic situation, the relevant departments in Shanghai have decided that the main direction of labor employment in the future is to participate in agricultural labor. This year, Shanghai has mobilized more than 80,000 people to return to their hometowns to participate in agricultural production, some of whom are unemployed people. In addition, relevant departments are recently actively guiding people in need of employment to engage in handicrafts, service industries, and household sideline labor.

    上海市劳动就业成绩很大
    每三个人中就有一人在工作
    今后就业方向主要是参加农业劳动
    据新华社上海17日电　在解放后短短的八年中，上海有八十万人有了职业，其中有二十多万人现在正在外地参加国家各方面的建设；在上海本地工作的五十三万就业人员中，工业方面占了四十六万人。
    据统计，到去年年底，上海就业总人数已达到二百三十九万人，平均每三个人中就有一个人在工作。
    上海过去是全国失业人口最多的城市。解放以来，全市登记的失业人员累计有六十七万一千多人，其中四十二万三千人是解放前遗留下来的失业人员，这几年来，共产党和人民政府采取了各种措施帮助失业人员创造就业条件，使具备就业条件的人员绝大部分走上了工作岗位，其中一部分参加了农业生产，还有一部分支援了外地的建设事业，使上海的失业现象大为减轻。到1956年底，已向劳动部门登记而尚未就业的失业人员已减少到十二万六千多人，其中约有一半是从事家务劳动的家庭妇女以及小商小贩和从事季节性工作的人，对这部分人来说，实际上已不需要另行安排工作了。
    目前，上海除了还有一定数量的失业人员以外，新生的需要就业的劳动力逐年增加。上海有关部门根据国家经济情况，决定今后劳动就业方向主要是参加农业劳动。今年上海就动员了八万多人回乡参加农业生产，其中有一部分就是失业人员。另外，有关部门最近正在积极指导需要就业的人从事手工业、服务性行业和家庭副业劳动。
