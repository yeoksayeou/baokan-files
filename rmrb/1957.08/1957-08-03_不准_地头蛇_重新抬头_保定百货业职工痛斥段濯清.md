Don't Allow "Local Snakes" to Raise Their Heads Again
Baoding Department Store Workers Denounce Duan Zhuoqing

(Our Dispatch) Baoding City's department store system workers and private personnel have been conducting criticism and exposure of Duan Zhuoqing, the rightist element and deputy director of the joint state-private Yu Lian Department Store.

Duan Zhuoqing said everywhere that the state should return the capital to the capitalists from the time of the joint venture. He incited industrialists and businessmen to oppose the Communist Party everywhere, saying, "The government only cares about the welfare of private personnel but doesn't care about their difficulties, the only ones who are happy are the poor kids (referring to the workers)." When the rightists launched a frenzied attack on the Party, Duan clapped his hands and cheered. He openly promoted support for Chiang Kai-shek, saying: "I support the one with the grass radical!" He also shamelessly said: "In the past, who didn't call me 'Master Duan', now I am restricted everywhere."

According to the workers of this store, when the meat supply in Baoding was tight, he spread rumors everywhere that "it was exported!" arousing public dissatisfaction. He compared the labor competition to playing with a bear, saying: "If you play well, you will be given a steamed bun to eat (referring to prizes)."

Before liberation, Duan Zhuoqing was a consistent speculator, taking advantage of his power to bully people, and committing all kinds of evil deeds. He was a "local snake" nicknamed "Duan the Skinflint" or "Pale Face Duan."

    不准“地头蛇”重新抬头
    保定百货业职工痛斥段濯清
    本报讯　保定市百货业系统的职工和私方人员，连日来对公私合营友联门市部副主任、右派分子段濯清进行批判和揭露。
    段濯清到处说，国家应该把合营时的资本还给资本家。他到处煽动工商业者反对共产党，说“政府对私方人员就是管凉不管酸，痛快的就是穷小子（指职工）”。当右派分子向党猖狂进攻的时候，段拍手称快。他公开宣扬拥护蒋介石，说：“我就拥护草字头的！”他还大言不惭地说：“过去谁见了我不称‘段爷’，现在处处受限制。”
    据这个店的职工揭露，保定肉食供应紧张时，他到处造谣说“出口了！”煽起人民的不满；他把劳动竞赛比作耍狗熊，说：“看你耍的好，就给块馍吃（指奖品）”。
    段濯清在解放前是个一贯投机倒把、仗势欺人、无恶不作的“地头蛇”，绰号叫“段扒皮”，“大白脸”。
