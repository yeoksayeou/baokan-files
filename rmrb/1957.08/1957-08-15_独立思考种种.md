    Various Aspects of Independent Thinking
    Yue Jun

    Independent thinking comes in various forms: there is independent thinking that stands on the working-class position and uses Marxist viewpoints, and there is also independent thinking that stands on a reactionary class position and uses anti-Marxist viewpoints. Although both are independent thinking, their motives, effects, and results are vastly different.

    Dogmatism, which treats individual Marxist phrases as dogma to be recited without concrete analysis in conjunction with actual circumstances, should certainly be opposed; because it stifles independent thinking and hinders the vigorous development of the socialist cause. However, revisionists and other anti-Marxists, under the banner of "opposing dogmatism" and "promoting independent thinking," are actually attempting to revise Marxism and achieve the goal of opposing socialism. Wasn't Liu Binyan, under the guise of "independent thinking," trying his best to encourage people to specifically look for the dark side of socialist reality in order to oppose socialism?

    Rightists who engage in this kind of "independent thinking" are actually more dangerous than dogmatists. Because dogmatists are often unconscious, and are utterly loyal to the socialist cause, they simply have not mastered Marxism, especially not yet learned materialist dialectics, do not know how to specifically analyze specific situations, and do not proceed from actual circumstances. Such people can easily be corrected once they become aware and learn materialist dialectics. As for the rightists, their position is anti-people, anti-working class, and they are consciously opposed to socialism and the Communist Party.

    Some people criticize those who do not think independently for "walking with a crutch," which is correct for intellectual loafers. But revolution and construction are by no means as pleasant or as simple as walking on flat ground. Revolution and construction are like climbing a mountain, and holding the crutch of Marxism is definitely necessary. Shouting "I want to think independently" and throwing away this crutch will inevitably lead to falls.

    One might ask: Is it good to parrot others? The answer is: it depends on how one parrots others. People say socialism is good, the Communist Party is good, and I also say socialism is good, the Communist Party is good, because these are facts! The independent thinking we advocate is independent thinking that stands on the working-class position, uses Marxist viewpoints, and not only does not depart from, but also strengthens the leadership of socialism and the Party. Independent thinking on such a basis should be promoted. What we oppose is anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist independent thinking. Creative Marxism must not only have a firm working-class position, not only be good at independent thinking, but also dare to think independently. Dogmatists are not good at independent thinking, self-serving individualists dare not think independently, while rightists stand on the bourgeois position and use bourgeois demands as the basis for their so-called "independent thinking." To learn correct independent thinking, for dogmatists, the first step is to combine with reality; for self-serving individualists, the first step is to abandon personal gains and losses; for rightists, the first step is to abandon that reactionary class position. Marxism cannot be fully understood overnight. If you do not understand Marxism but want to think independently, as long as you stand firm on the working-class position and abandon personal gains and losses, you will not make major mistakes.

    Chinese old intellectuals have the idea of "standing out as superior." Lin Xiling was able to "stand out," and thus won the praise of some people. But what Lin Xiling established was the difference of the bourgeoisie, and these people could not discover it. What kind of independent thinking is this? After liberation, some people were still saying that young people should be determined not to be slaves of life, and what they need most is the courage to advance against the current. This kind of character was revolutionary in the old society. But you also have to see what kind of wave and what kind of current it is. In today's China, if you do not follow the wave of the Communist Party, do not follow the current of socialism, but insist on going against the current and "thinking independently," only people like Chiang Kai-shek will appreciate this kind of thinking!

    独立思考种种
    岳军
    独立思考有各种各样：有站在工人阶级立场、运用马克思主义观点的独立思考，也有站在反动的阶级立场、运用反马克思主义观点的独立思考。同是独立思考，而其动机、作用和效果是迥然不同的。
    把马克思主义的个别辞句当作教条来背诵、而不结合实际情况具体分析的教条主义，当然应该反掉；因为它们窒息了独立思考，阻碍了社会主义事业的蓬勃发展。但修正主义者和其他反马克思主义者，打着“反对教条主义”、“提倡独立思考”的旗帜，其实是企图修正马克思主义，达到反社会主义的目的。刘宾雁不是在“独立思考”的幌子下，竭力鼓动人们专门寻找社会主义现实生活中的阴暗面以便反对社会主义么？
    搞这种“独立思考”的右派分子，其实比教条主义更危险。因为教条主义者常是不自觉的，对社会主义事业是忠心耿耿的，只是没有掌握马克思主义，特别是还没有学会唯物辩证法，不会具体地分析具体情况，不会从实际情况出发。这种人一经觉悟，一经学会唯物辩证法，便容易纠正。至于右派分子，他们的立场是反人民、反工人阶级的立场，他们是自觉地反对社会主义和共产党的。
    有人批评不独立思考者的“扶杖而行”，这对思想懒汉来说是对的。但革命和建设，决不如走平地那样惬意，那样简单。革命和建设像爬山，如果手执马克思主义的杖，肯定是必要的。高喊“我要独立思考”呀，把这根杖也丢掉了，结果必然会跌跤子。
    或问：人云亦云好不好？答曰：这要看怎样的人云亦云。人云社会主义好、共产党好、我亦云社会主义好、共产党好，因为这是事实呀！我们提倡的独立思考，是站在工人阶级立场上、运用马克思主义观点的独立思考，是不仅不离开、而且要加强社会主义和党的领导的独立思考。在这样基础上的独立思考，就应该提倡。我们反对的是反党反人民反社会主义的独立思考。创造性的马克思主义，不仅要有坚定的工人阶级立场，不仅要善于独立思考，而且要敢于独立思考。教条主义者不善于独立思考，患得患失的个人主义者不敢于独立思考，右派分子则站在资产阶级的立场，以资产阶级的要求作为自己的所谓“独立思考”的依据。想学会正确的独立思考，对于教条主义者说，首先是结合实际；对于患得患失的个人主义者说，首先是摈弃个人得失；对于右派分子说，首先是放弃那反动的阶级立场。马克思主义不是旦夕所能学通的，如果不懂得马克思主义而要独立思考，只要站稳工人阶级的立场，摈弃个人得失，也不至于犯大错误了。
    中国的旧知识分子有“立异为高”的思想，林希翎能“立异”，于是乎博得了某些人的赞扬。但林希翎所立的是资产阶级之异，这些人却不能发现，这算什么独立思考呢？解放后，还有人在说，青年人要决心不作生活的奴隶，最需要的是有逆流而进的勇气。这种性格在旧社会是革命的。但也要看看是怎样的波、怎样的流。在今天的中国，不随共产党之波，不逐社会主义之流，而偏要逆流而进、“独立思考”，这种思考，只有蒋介石之辈才会赞赏它！
