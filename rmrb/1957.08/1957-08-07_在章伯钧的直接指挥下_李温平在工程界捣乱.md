This newspaper reports: The anti-Rightist struggle in the Ministry of Construction Engineering, which lasted for more than 40 days, has exposed and criticized a group of rightists, the most important of whom is Li Wenping, Deputy Chief Engineer of the Mechanical Construction Group Research Office of the Academy of Building Research and Liaison Committee Member of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party.

Under the direct instruction of Zhang Bojun, Li Wenping attempted to usurp leadership in Beijing's engineering and technical circles. He participated in the conspiratorial meeting held by Zhang Bojun at the CPPCC Club on May 8 to plot against the Communist Party. This meeting established six ignition groups for engineering technology, medicine and health, transportation, farmland water conservancy, and scientific research. Li Wenping was the head of the technology group. On May 17, Zhang Bojun hosted a dinner for engineering and technical personnel at the Beijing Hotel, and the list was proposed by Li Wenping. When the rectification campaign began, Li Wenping investigated the history of technical personnel above the level of engineer in the academy, found the shortcomings of each person and the "gaps" in their relationship with the Communist Party, and provoked and exploited them. He also lined up the Communist Party members above the section chief level, collected their shortcomings and mistakes, exaggerated them, in order to attack the Party. He also attempted to collude with other democratic parties in the academy to overthrow the Party's leadership over the Academy of Building Research, advocating that the academy's policies, tasks, and personnel arrangements should first be discussed by the democratic parties and non-party personnel they favored, then put forward proposals, and then handed over to the Communist Party for implementation. Li Wenping also faithfully implemented Zhang Bojun's instructions on developing the organization, planning to absorb all technical personnel above the engineer level in the Academy of Building Research into the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, in order to expand their political capital.

After more than ten meetings of exposure and criticism held continuously by the Academy of Building Research, Li Wenping has admitted some facts of being anti-communist and anti-people.

    在章伯钧的直接指挥下
    李温平在工程界捣乱
    本报讯　历时四十多天的建筑工程部的反右派斗争，已经揭发和批判了一批右派分子，其中最重要的一名右派骨干分子是建筑科学研究院机械施工组研究室副总工程师、农工民主党北京市委联络委员李温平。
    李温平在章伯钧的直接指使下，企图篡夺北京工程技术界领导权。他参加了5月8日章伯钧在政协俱乐部召开的策划反共的阴谋会议，这次会议成立了工程技术、医药卫生、交通运输、农田水利、科学研究等六个点火小组，李温平就是技术组的负责人。5月17日，章伯钧在北京饭店请工程技术人员吃饭，名单就是李温平提出的。整风开始，李温平调查了本院工程师以上技术人员的历史，找出每个人的缺点和同共产党关系中的“缺口”，加以挑拨和利用。他还把科长以上的共产党员排了队，搜集他们的缺点和错误，加以渲染夸大，以便攻击党。他还企图串联本院其他民主党派共同推翻党对建筑科学院的领导，主张本院的方针任务和人事安排等，都先由民主党派和他们看中的无党派人士开会讨论，提出方案，而后交给共产党执行。李温平还不折不扣地执行章伯钧关于发展组织的指示，计划把建筑科学院工程师以上的技术人员“一网”吸收入农工民主党，以便扩大他们的政治资本。
    经过建筑科学研究院连续召开十多次会议的揭发和批判，李温平已经承认一些反共反人民的事实。
