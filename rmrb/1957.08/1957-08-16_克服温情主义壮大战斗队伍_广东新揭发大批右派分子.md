Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 15th: After criticizing sentimentalism, more and more cadres in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou city-level organizations are participating in the anti-Rightist struggle. At present, more than 50,000 cadres have actively participated in this struggle, and the mobilization of the masses in many units has reached more than 90%.

Through the active exposure by the broad masses of cadres, the number of Rightists exposed in various units has nearly doubled compared to the previous period. Some Rightist cliques have also been exposed. Units that were originally thought to have no Rightists have now also discovered Rightists. Chen Jincan, a Rightist in the Provincial Trading Company, viciously scolded Communist Party members as "butchers" and "ugly and despicable" during the Great Blooming and Letting period. He completely negated the achievements of the Su Fan work and said, "Welcome democratic parties to lead." At that time, some people sympathized with him ideologically, thinking that he was just temporarily extreme. Chen Jincan took the opportunity to refuse to examine himself, clamoring that "history will judge who is right", and "even if I am overthrown, the market will still exist." After criticizing sentimentalism, many people resolutely drew a line between themselves and him and actively launched a struggle against him. Qi Hengfang revealed that Chen Jincan had been collecting materials to attack the Communist Party since he returned from Lanzhou University. Others revealed the details of him everywhere pulling people to sign their names on big-character posters. After his open letter attacking the Party's cadre policy was issued, he conspired with the Rightist Liao Yushu, attempting to echo each other. Under everyone's exposure and confrontation, Chen Jincan had to lower his head and admit his guilt.

In the anti-Rightist struggle, many cadres actively used methods such as posting big-character posters, publishing blackboard newspapers, and drawing cartoons to expose the ugly faces of the Rightists. Lin Peng, a Rightist theoretical instructor of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee Lecturers' Group, once falsely accused the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee of subjectivism, which caused local cadres to "suffer" in previous movements. Cadres of the Organization Department of the Provincial Party Committee used statistical charts to refute his fallacies, leaving Lin Peng speechless. In the units under the Provincial People's Committee, ten Rightists could not deny the facts exposed by the masses and bowed their heads to admit their anti-Communist crimes.

    克服温情主义壮大战斗队伍
    广东新揭发大批右派分子
    新华社广州15日电  广东省和广州市级机关经过批判温情主义以后，参加反右派斗争的人数愈来愈多。目前已有五万多名干部积极参加了这一斗争，许多单位群众的发动面已达90％以上。
    经过广大干部积极揭露，目前各单位被揭露出来的右派分子比前一个时期增加将近一倍。一些右派小集团也被揭露出来。原来认为没有右派分子的单位，现在也发现了右派分子。省贸易公司右派分子陈锦灿在大鸣大放期间，曾恶毒地骂共产党员是“屠夫”、“丑恶、卑鄙”，他全部否定肃反工作的成绩，并说“欢迎民主党派来领导”。当时有些人在思想上曾同情他，认为他不过是一时的偏激。陈锦灿也就趁势拒不检讨，叫嚣“是非自有公论”、“整倒我，市场还有”。经过批判温情主义以后，许多人就坚决地和他划清了界限，积极起来向他展开斗争。祁衡芳揭露陈锦灿从兰州大学回来后就一直搜集攻击共产党的材料。另外一些人则揭露他到处拉人在大字报上签名的详情。在他攻击党的干部政策的公开信发出后，他又同右派分子廖于枢密谋，企图互相呼应。在大家的揭露和对证下，陈锦灿不得不低头认罪。
    在反右派斗争中，许多干部积极利用出大字报、出黑板报、画漫画等方式，来揭露右派分子的丑恶面目。中共广东省委讲师团理论教员右派分子林鹏，曾污蔑中共广东省委主观主义因而使地方干部在历次运动中“受灾”。省委组织部干部用统计图表对他的谬论加以驳斥，使林鹏理屈词穷。省人民委员会所属的单位中，也有十名右派分子抵赖不了群众的揭露出来的事实，低头承认了他们的反共罪行。
