    Trade and Fingerprints
    A commentator from this newspaper

    Due to obstruction by the current Japanese government, the establishment of mutual commercial representative offices as stipulated in the Third Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement has not been implemented to this day; and the preparations for the Chinese commodity exhibition originally scheduled to be held in Nagoya and Fukuoka, Japan this autumn, had to be temporarily shelved. One of the main obstacles between these issues is the Japanese government's unreasonable requirement that Chinese trade representatives and staff members must have their fingerprints taken if they stay in Japan for more than two months.

    However, the Japanese government has recently repeatedly issued statements in an attempt to shirk its responsibility for obstructing Sino-Japanese trade. When answering accusations from members of the Diet regarding the fingerprinting issue, Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama recently stated that it would be "bad to change the fingerprinting issue rashly." He said, "The fingerprinting issue is completely separate from the issue of expanding trade," and hoped that China would not "misunderstand." On August 3, the Japanese Foreign Ministry issued another statement, on the one hand, making empty talk about the Japanese government's "consistent expectation of developing" Sino-Japanese trade, and on the other hand, continuing to insist on the unreasonable attitude of requiring Chinese trade personnel to have their fingerprints taken. One cannot help but ask: Since the fingerprinting issue is completely separate from the issue of expanding trade, and the Japanese government hopes that Sino-Japanese trade will develop, why does it insist on linking the trade issue with the fingerprinting issue? What exactly does it want to achieve?

    An article written by Ikeda Masanosuke, Chairman of the Special Committee on Sino-Japanese Trade of the Liberal Democratic Party, in the "Asahi Shimbun" on July 21, discussed the origin of the fingerprinting issue. He said: "Since before the war, Japan has had a large number of people coming in and out from South Korea and other Asian countries, many of whom smuggled across the border. It is rare to find a country in the world with such frequent and numerous entries and exits, so it is difficult to take action based on photos alone, and the method of fingerprinting was adopted." According to Ikeda, fingerprinting is clearly intended to crack down on smuggling. Do official trade representatives dispatched between the two countries, even if they are of a non-governmental nature, have anything in common with those who smuggle across the border that requires prevention or cracking down? It can be seen that the Japanese government's emphasis on requiring our trade representatives and staff members to have their fingerprints taken is an insult to our country, and at the same time, it is actually hindering the development of Sino-Japanese trade.

    On the same day, the "Asahi Shimbun" also published an article written by Hoashi Kei, Chairman of the Socialist Party's Committee on Countermeasures for Trade with China. In addition to pointing out that the fingerprinting system was a product of the chaotic period after the end of the war to prevent the smuggling of opium and contraband, he also pointed out that requiring fingerprints for cultural and trade envoys with clear identities is an unreasonable demand with a "detective novel flavor" that can only arouse resentment from the people of other countries. He said that according to the current fingerprinting system, "public officials" or "those who are deemed to be public officials" are exempt from fingerprinting. He also cited an example, saying that personnel from the South Korean "government," with which Japan has not yet established normal diplomatic relations, have been exempted from the fingerprinting requirement. It can be seen that what the Japanese government says about "system" and "principles" that cannot be "changed rashly" is nothing more than an excuse.

    The facts are very clear: The Japanese government's insistence on linking the fingerprinting issue with the trade issue is nothing more than setting up an artificial obstacle in Sino-Japanese trade activities in order to hinder the establishment of mutual commercial representative offices and our country's holding of commodity exhibitions in Japan.

    Trade should be an equal and mutually beneficial matter. Sino-Japanese trade should and can develop better. We understand that the broad masses of the Japanese people and the majority of people in the industrial and commercial sectors have such a desire. Because this is in the interests of the people of both countries and is beneficial to the economic development of both countries. The attitude adopted by the current Japanese government is clearly not in the interests of the people of China and Japan. If the Japanese government does not change its current attitude, simply talking about "continuing to expand trade with China" and announcing export lists, as the Japanese newspapers have said, is tantamount to "drawing cakes," which is of no help. This is not so much making things difficult for the Chinese people as it is creating greater difficulties for the Japanese economy, which relies on trade as its lifeline. There are many countries that want to trade with China now, and the bankruptcy of the US embargo policy has already proven this point. The Japanese government's insistence on an unfriendly and difficult attitude on the issue of Sino-Japanese trade will only end up shooting itself in the foot.

    Despite the unfriendly and even hostile attitude that the current Japanese government has adopted towards China, the Chinese people will continue to extend a hand of friendship to the Japanese people, we will continue to dedicate ourselves to strengthening the friendly exchanges between the Chinese and Japanese people, and we will continue to welcome people from all walks of life in Japan to visit China. Because friendship does not require a passport, nor does it require fingerprints.

    贸易和指印
    本报评论员
    由于日本现政府的阻挠，使第三次中日贸易协定所规定的互设商务代表机构问题，至今无法实施；使我国方面原定今年秋天在日本名古屋和福冈举行的中国商品展览会的筹备工作，也无法进行而不得不暂时搁置。横在这些问题之间的主要阻碍之一，是日本政府提出的要中国贸易代表和工作人员在日本停留两个月以上时必须按捺指印的无理要求。
    可是，日本政府方面最近一再发表声明，企图推卸它阻碍中日贸易的责任。日本外务相藤山爱一郎最近在回答国会议员对按捺指印问题的指责时，仍然表示按指纹问题“轻率地加以改变是不好的”。他说：“按指纹问题同扩大贸易问题完全是另一回事”，希望中国不要“误解”。8月3日，日本外务省又发表声明，一方面空谈日本政府对中日贸易“一贯地期望它有所发展”，一方面又继续坚持要中国贸易工作人员按指印的无理态度。人们不禁要问：既然按指纹问题同扩大贸易问题完全是两回事，日本政府又希望中日贸易有所发展，它为什么又硬要把贸易问题同按指印问题扯在一起呢？它究竟要达到什么目的呢？
    7月21日“朝日新闻”上有自由民主党日中贸易特别委员会主席池田政之辅写的一篇文章，其中谈到了按指印问题的由来。他说：“日本自战前就从韩国以及亚洲各国有众多的人出出进进，其中走私越境的也很多。世界上出入国者如此频繁众多的国家是少见的，因此只靠照片难于取缔，而采取了按指印的办法。”照池田的说法，按指印显然是为了取缔走私越境的。两国之间派出的正式贸易代表，即使是民间性质的，难道同走私越境的有什么类似之处，需要加以防范或取缔吗？可见，日本政府强调要求我国贸易代表和工作人员按捺指印，是对我国的侮辱，同时实际上也是在阻挠中日贸易的发展。
    同一天的“朝日新闻”上还有社会党中国贸易对策委员会主席帆足计写的一篇文章。他除了同样指出按捺指印制度是战争结束以后的混乱时期，为了防止偷运鸦片和走私越境的产物而外，还指出：对于身份明确的文化、贸易使节等等，要求按捺指印，乃是一种“侦探小说趣味”的无理要求，是只能引起其他国家人民的反感的。他说：根据现行指印制度，对于“公务人员”或“准于公务人员者”得免除按捺指印。他并且举出实例说，对于同日本尚未建立正常国交的南朝鲜“政府”人员，就曾免除过按捺指印的要求。可见，日本政府说什么“制度”“原则”不能“轻率地加以改变”，也无非是一种借口而已。
    事实已经非常明白，日本政府坚持把按捺指印问题同贸易问题扯在一起，无非是要在中日贸易活动中间设下一道人为的障碍，以阻挠互设商务代表机构和我国在日本举行商品展览会。
    进行贸易，应该是平等互利的事情。中日贸易应该而且可能发展得更好。我们了解，日本广大人民和工商业界大多数人士是具有这样的愿望的。因为这符合于两国人民的利益，对两国的经济的发展都是有利的。日本现政府所采取的态度，显然是不符合中日两国人民的利益的。日本政府不改变目前的态度，只是空谈什么要“继续扩大同中国的贸易”，宣布什么输出货单，正如日本报刊所说，都无异于“画饼”，无补于事。这与其说是同中国人民为难，不如说对于以贸易为其生命线的日本经济造成了更大的困难。目前想同中国进行贸易的国家多得很，美国禁运政策的破产，早已证明了这点。日本政府在中日贸易问题上坚持不友好的刁难态度，其结果将只能是搬起石头砸自己的脚。
    尽管日本现政府对于中国采取了不友好的甚至敌视的态度，但是对于日本人民，中国人民将继续伸出友谊的手，我们将继续致力于加强中日人民的友好往来，我们将继续欢迎日本各界人士前来中国访问。因为友谊是不需要护照的，也不需要按捺指印。
