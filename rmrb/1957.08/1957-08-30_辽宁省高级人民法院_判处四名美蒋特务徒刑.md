Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 29th: The Liaoning Provincial Higher People's Court publicly tried and sentenced two groups of American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) secret agents in Shenyang on the 23rd and 24th. Both groups of American-sent secret agents were arrested in 1955.

Wang Congyou (alias Wang Xin Yi, Hu Yu Feng), the American-sent secret agent major group leader with twenty-seven years of counter-revolutionary history, who had previously escaped and resisted arrest, was sentenced to life imprisonment according to law. Zhou Shuyun (alias Zhou Hanwei, Zhou Rutian), a second lieutenant secret agent sent by the United States, was sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment. Zhao Deliang (alias He Deqi, Lin Chong), another American-sent secret agent group leader, and Fei Zhenying, a captain secret agent, were each sentenced to eight years imprisonment. The American-made secret agent communication and liaison equipment, pistols, daggers, steel whips, handcuffs, and other weapons seized during the capture of these two groups of American secret agents, as well as gold bars, gold rings, Renminbi, and other secret agent activity funds, were also displayed in the courtroom.

These two groups of secret agent criminals were all trained by the "Southern Training Class," a secret agent training organization jointly run by the US and Chiang Kai-shek, and directly dispatched to the mainland by the American CIA. Zhao Deliang and Fei Zhenying belonged to the first secret agent group of Group C of the American "Southern Training Class" (an organization specializing in secret agent activities against the Liaodong and Shandong Peninsulas). They departed from Daeyido Island, a US secret agent base in South Korea, on September 14, 1955, and landed in Zhuanghe County, Liaoning Province, at 11:00 p.m. that night. However, they were eventually captured by our border troops and public security personnel after being reported by the masses.

The secret agents Wang Congyou and Zhou Shuyun belonged to the second group of Group C of the American "Southern Training Class" and landed in Andong County at 11:00 p.m. on November 23, 1955. They were captured by our public security organs less than thirteen hours after landing.

As early as the early summer of 1955, American secret agent agencies sent Zhao Deliang, Wang Congyou, and others to Okinawa in batches by special plane for specialized training in intelligence observation and communications. After being transferred to Seoul, South Korea, they also conducted multiple landing exercises. But what awaited the American secret agent agencies was yet another shameful failure.

    辽宁省高级人民法院
　　判处四名美蒋特务徒刑
    据新华社沈阳29日电　辽宁省高级人民法院23、24两日在沈阳公开审理、宣判了两批美国中央情报局派遣的特务。这两批美国派遣特务都是在1955年被逮捕的。
    有二十七年反革命历史、曾逃跑拒捕的美国派遣特务少校组长王从佑（化名王心一、胡玉丰），被依法判处无期徒刑。美国派遣的少尉特务周述云（化名周汉伟、周汝田）被判有期徒刑十五年。另一美国派遣特务组长赵得梁（化名何德棋、林冲）和上尉特务费振英，也各被判有期徒刑八年。在捕获这两批美国特务时缴获的美制特务通讯、联络用具、手枪、匕首、钢丝鞭子、手铐等凶器，以及金条、金圈、人民币等特务活动经费也陈列在审判庭上。
    这两批特务罪犯都是经美蒋合办的特务训练机关“南方训练班”训练后由美国中央情报局直接派遣来大陆的。赵得梁和费振英是属于美国“南方训练班”C组（专对辽东半岛和山东半岛进行特务活动的组织）的第一特务小组。在1955年9月14日从美国派遣特务基地南朝鲜大伊作岛出发，当晚十一时在辽宁省庄河县境登陆。但是，他们终于在群众的检举下，被我边防军和公安人员捕获。
    特务王从佑和周述云是属于美国“南方训练班”C组的第二小组，1955年11月23日夜十一时在我安东县境登陆。他们登陆后不到十三小时，就被我公安机关捕获。
    早在1955年初夏，美国特务机关就分批以专用飞机把赵得梁、王从佑等送到冲绳岛，进行情报观察、通讯报务等专门训练。转送到南朝鲜汉城以后，又进行了多次的偷渡登陆演习。但是等待着美国特务机关的，却是又一次的可耻的失败。
