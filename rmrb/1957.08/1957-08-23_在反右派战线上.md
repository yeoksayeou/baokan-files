　　On the Anti-Rightist Front

　　The judicial circles of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region expose Yang Tenggao's reactionary words and deeds
    The Higher People's Court, the Department of Justice, and the Preparatory Office of the Lawyers Association of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region recently exposed the anti-Party words and deeds of the rightist Yang Tenggao.
    Yang Tenggao was a learning lawyer at the Urumqi Legal Advisory Office. In the courtroom, he openly shielded criminals. During the "Blooming and Contending," he incited criminals undergoing reform through labor to go to the central government to file accusations. This July, when a released labor reform criminal complained to him about his "grievances," he instigated this person to "report to higher authorities."
    Yang Tenggao also very bluntly slandered the judicial circles, saying that "sectarianism is most serious in the judicial circles."
　　Lin Yucang's heart is in Taiwan while he is on the mainland, clamoring for the Communist Party to give way to a third party
    Lin Yucang, deputy director of the Fu'an Transportation Main Station in Fujian Province, frantically attacked the leadership of the Party and the working class. He said, "China does not necessarily have to be led by the Communist Party to become a strong and prosperous country," and openly proposed that the Communist Party "give way" to a "third party that is superior to the Communist Party."
    It is not surprising that Lin Yucang uttered anti-Communist and anti-people nonsense. Before liberation, he was a Kuomintang district branch member and a capable assistant to Wu Qiaosheng, the head of the Kuomintang secret agent, who is now undergoing reform through labor, and did many anti-people things. After liberation, the People's Government retained him, but he still said that "his person is on the mainland, but his heart is in Taiwan."
  　How can supply and marketing cooperatives be occupied by rightists? Ma Hongsheng and Bi Qing are just wasting their efforts
    Employees of the finance and trade departments in Jiangxi Province exposed a group of rightists.
    Ma Hongsheng, a clerk in the office of the Jiangxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative and a rightist, openly clamored that the Communist Party should not lead the supply and marketing cooperatives. He cursed the provincial supply and marketing cooperative as "dim and dull," and declared that "even at the cost of losing fifty-seven yuan (referring to his monthly salary of fifty-seven yuan), he would smash the 'gate' (referring to the leadership of the Communist Party) to pieces."
    Bi Qing, a clerk in the savings section of the Provincial People's Bank and a historical counter-revolutionary, slandered Communist Party members as "starting their careers with four reliances": "First, relying on signboard, second, relying on labeling people, third, relying on seniority, and fourth, relying on movements," and then proposed to the Communist Party to "open up the door," with "equal opportunities" for the masses and Party members, to "conduct 'peaceful competition' with Party members," thereby opposing the leadership of the Communist Party.

　　在反右派战线上
　  新疆维吾尔自治区司法界揭发杨腾高的反动言行
    新疆维吾尔自治区高级人民法院、司法厅和律师协会筹备处最近揭发右派分子杨腾高的反党言行。
    杨腾高是乌鲁木齐市法律顾问处的学习律师，在法厅上，公开袒护犯罪分子。在“鸣”“放”期间，他竟在劳改犯中煽动刑满留场人员去中央控告。今年7月，一个刑满的劳改犯向他诉说自己的“委屈”时，他又唆使这个人“向上级控告”。
    杨腾高还十分露骨地污蔑司法界，说“宗派主义最严重的莫过于司法界”。
　  林裕苍人在大陆心在台湾叫嚣要共产党让位给第三党
    福建省福安运输总站副总站长林裕苍，疯狂地向党和工人阶级的领导权进攻。他说“中国要变成一个富强的国家，并不一定非共产党领导不可”，并公然提出要共产党“让贤”，让位给“比共产党更优越的第三党”。
    林裕苍发出反共反人民的谰言，并不惊奇。原来在解放前，他就是国民党的区分部委员，并且是军统特务头子吴乔生（现在劳改）的得力助手，做过许多反人民的事情。解放后人民政府留用了他，他仍然说自己“人在大陆，心在台湾”。
  　供销社岂能让右派分子霸占马洪生、毕清只不过枉费心机
    江西省财政贸易部门的职工揭露出一批右派分子。
    江西省供销合作总社办公室科员、右派分子马洪生，公开叫嚣不要共产党领导供销合作社。他咒骂省供销社是“暗淡无光”，扬言“拼着丢掉五十七元（指他每月工资五十七元），也要把‘大门’（指共产党的领导）打得粉碎”。
    省人民银行储蓄科科员、历史反革命分子毕清，污蔑共产党员是“四靠起家”：“一靠招牌，二靠给人扣帽子，三靠资格，四靠运动”，进而向共产党提出要“门户开放”，群众和党员“机会均等”，“和党员进行‘和平竞赛’”，借此来反对共产党的领导。
