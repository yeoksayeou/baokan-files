    Planned Evacuation of Non-Productive Urban Personnel
    Six to Seven Thousand People in Taiyuan City Have Gone to the Countryside
    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, August 14th: Recently, Taiyuan City has successively mobilized more than 6,000 flatbed workers who had recently entered the city from the countryside and more than 800 vagrants and disaster victims who blindly flowed into the city to return to their hometowns to participate in agricultural production.
    According to investigations by the relevant departments, the number of non-productive personnel in Taiyuan City has increased sharply in recent years. As of the end of June this year, the urban dependent population has reached 56.6% of the city's total population. Among these people, most are direct and non-direct relatives who have labor conditions in the countryside or do not need to live in the city with their employees. A considerable proportion are vagrants with no proper occupation who have flowed into the city due to lax urban household registration management, or temporary workers hired by some units without unified allocation by the labor department. This has created tension in the city's supply of grain, housing, transportation, vegetables, and non-staple foods.
    From now until April 1958, Taiyuan City plans to evacuate 100,000 non-productive personnel in batches. On August 13, the Taiyuan Municipal Civil Affairs, Labor, and Grain Departments, as well as the Communist Youth League and Women's Federation, jointly formed relevant working bodies, preparing to complete the repatriation of the first batch of 50,000 temporary workers, disaster victims, vagrants, and some employee family members before the end of November this year.

    有计划地疏散城市非生产人员
    太原市已有六、七千人到农村去
    新华社太原14日电  太原市最近陆续动员了六千多名不久前从农村进入城市的平车工人和八百多名盲目流入城市的游民、灾民回乡参加农业生产。
    据主管部门调查，近年来太原市非生产人员急剧增长。截至今年6月底止，城市被抚养人口已达到全市人口总数的56.6％。在这些人中，大都是在农村有劳动条件或不必要随职工来城市居住的直系和非直系亲属。还有相当部分是因城市户口管理不严而流入城市的无正当职业的游民，或一些单位不经过劳动部门统一调配而招雇来的临时工人。这样，就造成了城市粮食、居住、交通运输和蔬菜副食品供应上的紧张。
    从现在起到1958年4月份，太原市还准备分批疏散十万非生产人员。8月13日，太原市民政、劳动、粮食部门和青年团、妇联单位已经联合组成有关的办事机构，准备在今年11月底以前完成首批五万名临时工、灾民、游民和一部分职工家属的返乡工作。
