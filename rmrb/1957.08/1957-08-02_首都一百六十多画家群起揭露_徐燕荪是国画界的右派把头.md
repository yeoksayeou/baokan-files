Xinhua News Agency, August 1st – At a forum of Beijing traditional Chinese painters held today, the reactionary words and deeds of Xu Yansun, a rightist element in the world of traditional Chinese painting, were exposed and criticized. The forum was jointly convened by the Ministry of Culture, the Chinese Artists Association, and the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Workers, with over 160 traditional Chinese painters in attendance.

Those who spoke at the meeting successively included Chen Yuandu, Wu Yige, Wu Jingting, Yu Feian, Yin Boheng, Duan Luqing, Ye Qianyu, Wang Youshi, and others. The Ministry of Culture and the Chinese Artists Association also received numerous letters and materials exposing Xu Yansun’s anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds.

Many people revealed at the meeting that Xu Yansun has consistently been anti-Party and anti-socialist. As a standing director of the Beijing Traditional Chinese Painting Research Society, he implemented personal autocracy within the society. After becoming the vice president of the Chinese Painting Academy, he attempted to replace the leadership of the Communist Party with feudal patriarchal rule and dominate the Painting Academy. He openly said, "The Chinese Painting Academy was scolded out by me, and this vice president of mine was also scolded out by me." Yu Feian revealed that Xu Yansun and others also drafted a so-called "Comprehensive Plan Draft for the Chinese Painting Academy," attempting to replace the "Implementation Plan for the Chinese Painting Academy" and the "Regulations for Hiring Painters and Artists" approved by the Ministry of Culture. In this "draft" and in his conversations, Xu Yansun frequently emphasized that "the affairs of the traditional Chinese painting world should be handled by traditional Chinese painters," and "the Communist Party must not be allowed to control it." He defended himself, but precisely here he revealed his true colors, saying, "Opposing the leadership of the Party does not equal opposing the Party." He excluded Party member painter Zhang Ding from participating in the work of the Painting Academy and attacked non-Party painters such as Ye Qianyu, saying, "Ye Qianyu should be eliminated. He is not only an accomplice but also an executioner. The Chinese Painting Academy will absolutely not allow him to intervene." Xu Yansun also ambitiously drafted a personnel list, luring his cronies and "disciples," and even bringing counter-revolutionary elements into the Painting Academy and the Painting Research Society, expanding his personal influence, resulting in many people sending him gifts, inviting him to dinner, and engaging in public bribery. The wife of rightist element Li Boqiu, who could not paint, was also introduced to the Painting Research Society by Xu Yansun.

Chen Yuandu and others revealed that since liberation, Xu Yansun has consistently openly and directly defied the leadership of the Party, behaving tyrannically and domineeringly in the traditional Chinese painting world, attacking progressive and upright people. He often scolded those close to the Communist Party as "sycophants," "shameless people who recognize thieves as fathers," and scolded Party members, Youth League members, and activists as "hateful informers." He also cursed the Party member leaders of the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles, saying, "Those grandsons, what have they seen of the world?" "What do they understand? They are not qualified to lead us," and said, "The Painting Research Society must be run proactively by us, and we cannot just listen to the Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles; otherwise, we will kick them away with one foot." He also provoked the relationship between the Party and the masses and undermined the unity of the art world. When the Chinese Painting Academy was established, Xu Yansun and Ye Gongchuo and Wang Xuetao twice convened meetings of middle-aged traditional Chinese painters at their private residences, inciting them to attack the art world and arranging for those present to write articles, provoking the relationship between the Party and the masses. Xu Yansun said that the colored ink paintings of Zhang Ding, Li Keran, etc., "How can they be called traditional Chinese paintings? They are just paintings made by Chinese people." He also said, "Nihilists have already penetrated the People's Daily, just like American military bases," attempting to provoke dissatisfaction in the traditional Chinese painting world with the Party newspaper and the leadership of the art world. Xu Yansun has consistently opposed and undermined the movements for suppressing counter-revolutionaries and ideological remolding. Yin Boheng and others revealed that during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, Xu Yansun protected counter-revolutionary elements. Duan Luqing revealed that during the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, Xu Yansun instructed his cronies to threaten people, saying, "If you expose Xu Yansun, you will be dragged into the vortex with him." Xu Yansun also believed that political study and ideological remolding were dogmatism and a waste of time.

Old traditional Chinese painter Wang Youshi and others revealed that after the rectification campaign began, Xu Yansun, under the instructions of Zhang Bojun and Li Boqiu, ignited the situation in the traditional Chinese painting world and attacked the Party. In early May, Zhang Bojun, Huang Qixiang, and others developed Party members by hosting banquets at the Hongbinlou Restaurant in Beijing, and Xu Yansun also attended the banquet. In late May, Zhang Bojun and Li Boqiu convened a forum for literary and art circles, and Xu Yansun attended and spoke, wantonly slandering the Party for not paying attention to traditional Chinese painting.

In early June, Xu Yansun and Ye Gongchuo convened another forum for the traditional Chinese painting world at Rongbaozhai, with Xu and Ye hiding in a room secretly directing. After the nationwide anti-rightist struggle began, Xu Yansun felt that the situation was not right and tried to probe and find out information everywhere. He even threatened those in the Chinese Painting Academy who actively participated in the anti-rightist struggle, saying, "What are you struggling against? In the future, these old painters will still be leading you."

Xu Yansun is known as the "local tyrant of the traditional Chinese painting world." He came from a bourgeois family and was himself a capitalist. Before liberation, he joined the Green Gang, opened gambling dens, smoked opium, and played with women, becoming a local bully. He also regarded himself as the treacherous hero "Cao Cao" in the novel, and had a seal engraved with the four characters "Little Name Aman."

The atmosphere at the forum was one of intense anger, with more than thirty painters requesting to speak. The meeting will continue on August 3rd.

    首都一百六十多画家群起揭露
    徐燕荪是国画界的右派把头
    新华社1日讯　国画界右派分子徐燕荪的反动言行在今天举行的北京国画界座谈会上受到揭露和批判。这次座谈会是由文化部、中国美术家协会、北京市文学艺术工作者联合会共同召开的，到会的有国画家一百六十多人。
    先后在会上发言的有陈缘督、吴一舸、吴镜汀、于非闇、殷伯衡、段履青、叶浅予、王友石等。文化部和美协还收到许多揭发徐燕荪反党反社会主义言行的信件和材料。
    许多人在会上揭露，徐燕荪一贯就是反党反社会主义的，他是北京国画会的常务理事，在国画会里实行个人专制，他担任中国画院副院长以后，更企图以封建家长式的统治代替共产党的领导，霸占国画院。他公开地说，“国画院是我骂出来的，我这个副院长也是我骂出来的”。于非闇揭发，徐燕荪等还拟了一个所谓“国画院全面计划草案”，企图以它代替文化部批准的“国画院实施方案”和“画师画士聘请条例”。徐燕荪在这个“草案”中和对人谈话时，经常强调“国画界的事应由国画家来办”，“决不能叫共产党来把持”，他又为自己辩护，而恰恰在这里露出马脚，他说：“反对党的领导并不等于反党”。他排斥党员画家张仃参加国画院工作，并打击非党画家叶浅予等，说“叶浅予应当消灭，他不仅是帮凶，而且是刽子手。国画院绝不允许他插手”。徐燕荪还野心勃勃地拟定人事名单，拉拢他的亲信、“徒弟”，甚至把肃反对象拉进国画院和国画会，扩大私人势力，以致形成许多人纷纷向他送礼，请他吃饭，公行贿赂。右派分子李伯球的妻子不会画画，也被徐燕荪介绍到国画会。
    陈缘督等人揭露，解放以后徐燕荪一贯公开和直接地违抗党的领导，在国画界横暴跋扈，打击进步和正派的人士。他常常骂靠近共产党的人是“献媚”、“无耻之徒，认贼作父”，骂党、团员和积极分子是“可恶的耳报神”。他还谩骂北京市文联的党员领导人说，“那群孙子，见过什么世面”、“他们懂什么，不配领导我们”，并说“国画会要办就得由我们主动，不能净听市文联的，不然一脚把他们踢开”。他还挑拨党群关系，破坏美术界的团结，在国画院成立时，徐燕荪和叶恭绰、王雪涛两次在私宅召集壮年国画家开会，煽动他们向美术界进攻，布置到会的人写文章，挑拨党群关系。徐燕荪说，张仃、李可染等的彩墨画“怎能叫国画？只不过是中国人画的而已”。他还说“虚无主义者已经深入到人民日报，就像美国的军事基地一样”，企图挑起国画界对党报和美术界领导的不满。徐燕荪一贯反对和破坏肃反和思想改造运动。殷伯衡等揭露，徐燕荪在肃反中，曾包庇反革命分子。段履青揭露，在肃反运动中，徐燕荪指使他的亲信向人威胁说：“你如果揭发徐燕荪，就把你一同卷进漩涡里去”。徐燕荪还认为，政治学习和思想改造是教条主义和浪费时间。
    老国画家王友石等揭露，整风开始以后，徐燕荪在章伯钧、李伯球指示下，在国画界点火，向党进攻。5月上旬章伯钧、黄琪翔等在北京鸿宾楼利用请客方式发展党员，徐燕荪也参加了宴会。5月下旬章伯钧、李伯球召开文艺界座谈会，徐燕荪到会发言，大肆污蔑党不重视国画。
  6月初，徐燕荪和叶恭绰在荣宝斋又召开了国画界座谈会，徐、叶藏在一间房内暗地指挥。全国反右派斗争开始后，徐燕荪觉得情况不对头，四出试探摸底，还威胁国画院中积极参加反右派斗争的人说，你们斗什么，将来领导你们的还不是这些老画家。
    徐燕荪被人们称为“国画界的恶霸”。他出身于资产阶级家庭，自己也是资本家。解放前他加入过青帮，开设赌局，抽鸦片、玩弄妇女，成为地方一霸。他还以小说中的奸雄“曹操”自居，刻制一个图章，上刻“小字阿瞒”四字。
    座谈会上群情激愤，有三十余位画家要求发言，会议将在8月3日继续举行。
