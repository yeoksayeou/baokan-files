    Determining Reasonable Allocation Methods Based on Resource Conditions
    The State Council Approves Reduction in Cotton Cloth Supply
    More Reduction in Cities, Less in Rural Areas – Eliminating Differences Between Workers, Cadres, Students, and Urban Residents – Conserving Industrial and Public Cloth
    The State Council instructs the People's Committees of all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government:
    The State Council has approved the report from the Ministry of Commerce regarding the supply of civilian cloth for the fourth year of the planned cotton cloth supply. The People's Committees of all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government should, in accordance with the spirit of this report and the cotton cloth supply methods, promptly arrange for the distribution of cloth coupons for the first period of the fourth year. Due to the relatively tight supply of cotton cloth, strict control must be exercised based on the actual population figures when distributing cloth coupons. Industrial cloth and all public cloth must be supplied in accordance with the spirit of conservation, ensuring that supply targets are reduced as much as possible and not exceeded. All industrial departments that use cotton, yarn, and cloth must strictly conserve raw materials. Explanations should be widely given to urban and rural people, especially to workers, cadres, and students in large cities, so that they understand the current difficulties in the supply of cotton cloth and consciously conserve cloth.
    In order to alleviate the tight cotton cloth supply situation in 1958, cotton-producing areas should also do the following three things well:
    1.  It is necessary to firmly grasp the leadership of cotton production, strengthen field management of cotton, and strive for a bumper harvest of cotton this year.
    2.  Mobilize cotton farmers to hand over cottonseeds to supply and marketing cooperatives for delinting and processing plants and conscientiously lead supply and marketing cooperatives to do a good job in stripping cotton linters, striving to complete this year's delinting tasks.
    3.  Strengthen political work among cotton farmers, strengthen the organization of cotton purchases, in order to strive to purchase more cotton. The State Council, August 16, 1957
    The Ministry of Commerce's Report on the Supply of Civilian Cloth for the Fourth Year of Planned Cotton Cloth Supply
    (August 3, 1957) To the State Council:
    September 1, 1957 to August 31, 1958, is the fourth year of planned cotton cloth supply. Now, the following report on the supply of civilian cloth for this year is submitted to the State Council:
    In 1957, the total cotton planting area in the country was approximately 87 million mu, a decrease of more than 6 million mu compared to 1956. The main reason for the reduction is that the grain supply in some cotton-producing areas was relatively tight, so cotton fields were reduced and grain was planted instead. If cotton has a bumper harvest this year, it is estimated that the annual production plan can be completed, that is, 30 million dan of cotton will be produced; however, if the year is average, it is estimated that there will only be 27 million to 28 million dan, and if there is a poor harvest, there may be even less. Because the cloth coupons for the fourth year of planned supply must be issued in August, the success or failure of cotton production cannot be determined at this time. In order to put the quota of cloth coupons for the fourth year on a solid and reliable basis, it can only be calculated according to the average year of cotton production, that is, 27 million to 28 million dan of cotton. Under the condition of producing 27 million to 28 million dan of cotton, after deducting cotton for cotton farmers' own use, wadding cotton, military cotton, and natural losses, only 4.1 million to 4.2 million bales of yarn can be spun next year. If the yarn for industrial use, knitting yarn, and military yarn all remain at this year's level, only about 127 million bolts of cloth can be woven next year. According to this figure, after deducting industrial cloth, public cloth, and military cloth, civilian cloth will be about 103 million bolts. Calculated on the basis of the national population, the average supply of civilian cloth per person per year is only 16 chi, a decrease of 4.65 chi compared to the average supply of civilian cloth per person per year after the discounted use of the third year's second round of cloth coupons for the planned cotton cloth supply of 20.65 chi. If cotton has a bumper harvest this year, it will be possible to produce about 4.5 million bales of cotton yarn, thereby enabling the average supply of civilian cloth per person per year nationwide to reach 18 chi. Therefore, during the fourth year of planned cotton cloth supply, the average cotton cloth quota supplied by the state to the people of the whole country is generally guaranteed to be 16 chi, and efforts will be made to reach 18 chi under the condition of a bumper cotton harvest.
    The method of issuing cloth coupons for the fourth year of the planned cotton cloth supply is still prepared to be issued in two periods: the first period is from September 1 this year to the end of February next year; the second period is from March 1 to the end of August next year. When using the first batch of cloth coupons, because it is winter and the weather is cold, in order to facilitate people in making winter clothes, about two-thirds of the total of 16 chi of cloth coupons for the whole year are issued, that is, an average quota of 11 chi per person. The second batch of cloth coupons will be issued in January and February next year based on the cotton harvest, with an average quota of no less than 5 chi per person, striving to reach 7 chi. The first batch of cloth coupons can still be extended to be valid until the end of August next year. We believe that this method of issuing cloth coupons in installments is the best possible way to meet the needs of the people for winter clothing under the existing cotton cloth resource conditions.
    Since the supply of cotton cloth in the fourth year is somewhat reduced compared to the previous year, the quantitative distribution method of cotton cloth should be adjusted as necessary. Since the implementation of planned cotton cloth supply in 1954, there have always been the following two situations in terms of cotton cloth quotas: the first situation is that the quota in cities is higher than in rural areas, among which large cities are higher than medium and small cities and towns. The second situation is that in most parts of the country, within the same region, the quota for workers, cadres, and students above secondary school is higher than that of ordinary residents. When the planned cotton cloth supply was first implemented, it was necessary to make the above two regulations. Because at that time, the situation in the free cotton cloth market was that less cloth was sold in rural areas and more cloth was sold in cities; and more cloth was sold in large cities than in medium and small cities. Among urban and rural people, the sales volume of cloth for workers, cadres, and students was also higher than that of ordinary residents. At that time, the implementation of this classified quota method enabled the people of all strata in cities and rural areas to buy cotton cloth roughly according to their different purchasing power levels, so that the distribution quantity of cotton cloth was roughly the same as the distribution situation in the free market at that time, thus supplying the needs of the people with different consumption levels as much as possible. However, the situation has gradually changed in recent years. On the one hand, the purchasing power of urban and rural people has increased, and residents who consumed less cotton cloth in the past are now demanding an increase in their cotton cloth supply, and they are dissatisfied with the higher quotas in cities and the higher quotas for workers, cadres, and students; on the other hand, due to the instability of cotton production, the state cannot guarantee that the annual supply of cotton cloth to residents will be more than the previous year. Especially when cotton production is reduced, and the supply of cotton cloth is bound to be reduced, the contradiction of quota imbalance between urban and rural areas and between classes is more prominent. Therefore, we believe that the previous regulations can no longer fully adapt to the current situation and should be changed. We are prepared to change the current situation from the following two aspects.
    First, when reducing the cotton cloth supply quota per person this year, cities will be reduced more and rural areas will be reduced less, greatly reducing the imbalance in cotton cloth quotas between urban and rural areas. When issuing cloth coupons for the fourth year, the country will be divided into two categories of regions. The first category is small and medium-sized cities, county towns, market towns, and rural areas, and there will be no difference in the quota per person between urban and rural areas. The second category is large cities (including provincial-level cities and large cities and large industrial and mining areas equivalent to provincial-level cities), and the quota can be slightly higher than the first category in principle, but the difference should not be too large. Taking Beijing as an example, in the last year of planned cotton cloth supply, the average quota per person per year was 35 chi, which was more than 14 chi higher than the national average quota of 20.65 chi. However, in the fourth year of planned supply, the average quota per person per year in Beijing is about 24 chi, which is only 8 chi or 6 chi higher than the national average quota of 16 chi or 18 chi, and about 11 chi less than the average quota per person per year in Beijing in the previous year. Because the average quota per person per year in cities is reduced more, the average quota per person per year in rural areas is reduced less. Roughly, the average quota per person per year in rural areas in the fourth year is only a little more than 1 chi less than the previous year. We believe that since the clothing reserves of urban people are generally thicker than those in rural areas, it is reasonable to reduce the quota in cities more and the quota in rural areas less when there is not enough cotton cloth. Moreover, the cotton cloth quota in cities is still not lower than that in rural areas after the reduction, and large cities have slightly more than the quota in rural areas due to consideration of higher purchasing power levels. Clothing products other than cotton cloth, such as silk fabrics, linen fabrics, and woolen fabrics, are also mostly sold in cities. We believe that urban people will understand the difficulties in the reduction of cotton cloth supply this year and accept the distribution measures taken by the government.
    Second, this year, in terms of distribution methods, the past regulations that the quota for workers, cadres, and students above secondary school was higher than that of local residents will be abolished, and it will be changed to be consistent with the quota of local residents. We believe that under the condition of reduced cotton cloth supply, it is appropriate to no longer maintain the gap between workers, cadres, and students and residents, and to advocate sharing weal and woe with residents. As long as there is publicity and explanation, workers, cadres, and students can understand the difficulties of the country and cooperate closely with the government. As for some workers who do use a lot of cloth and do not issue work clothes, such as road construction workers, construction workers, and coal miners, etc., various localities can give necessary adjustments and care in the temporary cloth use projects according to the specific circumstances.
    In terms of industrial cloth, from the perspective of the needs of industrial production development, it should be increased in principle, but since the supply of cotton cloth is insufficient this year, in order to ensure the supply of civilian cloth, we believe that except for the industrial cloth that the State Economic Commission has approved to increase, it should be maintained at the supply level of the previous year and will not be increased. Please coordinate and arrange within the scope of the indicators approved by the local People's Committees, practice strict economy, and promote substitution and recycling. Although the public cloth of organs, organizations, enterprises, and institutions has been reduced after implementing economy this year, there are still some waste phenomena, and it can be further economized. We believe that we should continue to implement the State Council's instructions on economizing public cloth issued on January 30 this year, and must ensure that the equipment cloth of organs, organizations, enterprises, and institutions will not be replaced with new cloth in the next year, work clothes should be promoted to be patched, and new clothes should not be replaced as much as possible.
    Due to the reduction of cotton fields due to disaster reduction last year and the reduction of cotton planting area this year, the state has repeatedly taken measures to reduce the supply of cotton cloth, and people will definitely feel some difficulties in their lives. However, as long as the people of the whole country and the government cooperate closely, make more use of old clothes, and add less new clothes, these difficulties can be overcome after taking the above distribution methods.
    Since liberation, my country's annual cotton production has increased a lot. However, due to the improvement of people's lives, cotton cloth is still in short supply. We must work hard to expand the cotton field area, increase the cotton field yield per unit area, and use other fibers to supply clothing, but these measures cannot be effective in the short term. Therefore, in a relatively long period of time to come, the people of the whole country will need to continue to save cloth.
    The above report is submitted to the State Council for review.

    根据资源条件确定合理分配办法
    国务院批准减少棉布供应
    城市多减，农村少减——取消职工干部学生同市民的差别——节约工业用布和公用布
    国务院批示各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会：
    国务院批准商业部关于棉布计划供应第四年度民用布供应问题的报告。各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会应当按照这个报告的精神和棉布供应办法，从速安排第四年度第一期布票的发放工作。由于棉布供应比较紧张，在发放布票的时候，必须根据实有人口数字严格加以控制。工业用布和一切公用布匹，必须按照节约的精神进行供应，切实保证供应指标力求减少而不被突破。一切用棉、用纱、用布的工业部门，必须严格节约原料。应当向城乡人民，特别是应当向大城市的职工、干部和学生广泛地进行解释工作，使他们了解国家目前棉布供应的困难情况，自觉地节约用布。
    为了缓和1958年棉布供应紧张的情况，各产棉地区还应该做好以下三件工作：
    一、必须抓紧对棉花生产的领导，加强棉花的田间管理工作，争取今年棉花的丰收。
    二、动员棉农把棉籽交给供销社脱绒加工厂并且认真领导供销社做好剥取棉籽短绒的工作，力争完成今年的剥绒任务。
    三、加强对棉农的政治工作，加强购棉的组织工作，以争取多购些棉花。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　国务院1957年8月16日
    商业部关于棉布计划供应第四年度中民用布供应问题的报告
    （1957年8月3日）国务院：
    1957年9月1日至1958年8月31日是棉布计划供应的第四个年度。现在将这个年度的民用布供应问题向国务院提出以下的报告：
    1957年全国的棉花种植面积共约八千七百余万亩，较1956年减少了六百余万亩。减少的主要原因是部分产棉区的粮食供应比较紧张，减少了棉田，改种了粮食。今年棉花如果丰收，估计可能完成年度生产计划，即产棉三千万担；但是，如果年景中常，估计只有二千七百万到二千八百万担，如果歉收，还有可能更少。由于计划供应第四年度的布票要在8月份内发放，这时棉花生产的丰歉还不能断定，为了把第四年度的布票定量放在稳妥可靠的基础上，只能按棉花生产的中常年景，即产棉二千七百万到二千八百万担计算。在产棉二千七百万到二千八百万担的条件下，除去棉农自用棉、絮棉、军用棉和自然损耗等以后，明年只能纺纱四百一十万件至四百二十万件。如果工业用纱、针织用纱和军用纱都维持今年的水平不变，明年只能织布一亿二千七百万匹左右。按照这个数字计算，除去工业用布、公共用布、军用布以后，民用布约为一亿零三百万匹左右。按全国人口平均计算，每人全年民用布平均供应量只有十六尺，比棉布计划供应第三年度第二期布票折扣使用以后的每人全年民用布平均供应量二十点六五尺要减少四点六五尺。如果今年棉花丰收，就有可能生产棉纱四百五十万件左右，从而使全国人民每人全年民用布平均供应量达到十八尺。因此，在棉布计划供应第四个年度内，国家供应给全国人民每人的平均棉布定量，一般保证十六尺，争取在棉花丰收的条件下达到十八尺。
    棉布计划供应第四年度布票发放的办法，仍然准备分为两期发放：第一期从今年9月1日至明年2月底；第二期从明年3月1日至8月底。在使用第一期布票的时候，因为是冬季，气候寒冷，为了便利人民添制冬衣，发了全年十六尺布票的三分之二左右，即每人平均定量十一尺。第二期布票根据棉花的收成情况，在明年1、2月间再发，每人平均定量不低于五尺，争取达到七尺。第一期布票仍然可以延期到明年8月底通用。我们认为这种分期发放布票的办法，是在现有棉布资源的条件下，尽最大的可能来供应人民冬衣需要的办法。
    由于第四年度棉布供应量比上一年度有所减少，因此棉布的定量分配办法应当作必要的调整。自从1954年实行棉布计划供应以来，在棉布定量上一直存在着以下两种情况：第一种情况是城市的定量高于乡村，其中大城市又高于中等城市和小城市。第二种情况是在全国大部分地方，在同一地区内，职工、干部和中等学校以上学生的定量高于一般居民。在开始实行棉布计划供应的时候，作以上这两种规定曾经是必要的。因为当时棉布自由市场的情况，是农村销布少，城市销布多；大城市销布又多于中、小城市。在城乡人民中，职工、干部和学生的销布量也高于一般居民。当时实行这种分类定量的办法，使城市与乡村各阶层人民能够大体上按照他们不同的购买力水平买到棉布，使棉布的分配数量大体上和当时自由市场的分配情况相同，因而尽可能地供应了人民不同消费水平的需要。但是近几年来的情况已经逐渐发生了变化。一方面城乡人民的购买力都有了增长，过去消费棉布较少的居民，现在纷纷要求增加对他们的棉布供应，他们对城市定量较高和工人、干部、学生的定量较高感到不满意；另一方面，由于棉花生产不稳定，国家不可能保证每年对居民的棉布供应量都比上一年多。特别是在棉花减产，势必减少棉布供应量的时候，这种城乡之间、阶层之间定量不平衡的矛盾就显得更为突出。因此我们认为，过去的规定已经不能完全适应目前的情况，应当加以改变。我们准备从以下两个方面来改变目前的状况。
    第一、今年减少每人棉布供应定量的时候，城市减得多，乡村减得少，大大缩小城乡之间棉布定量的不平衡。在发放第四年度布票的时候，将全国划分为两类地区，前一类是中小城市、县城、集镇和农村，每人的定量不再存在着城乡的差别；后一类是大城市（包括省辖市和相当于省辖市的大城市和大工矿区），定量在原则上可以比前一类稍高一点，但相差不宜过大。以北京为例，在上一棉布计划供应年度内，每人全年平均定量为三十五尺，比全国每人平均定量二十点六五尺高十四尺多。但在第四计划供应年度内，北京每人全年平均定量约为二十四尺，比全国每人平均定量十六尺或十八尺只高八尺或六尺，比上一年度的北京每人全年定量减少了大约十一尺。由于城市每人全年平均定量减少得多，乡村每人平均定量就减少得少，大体上第四年度乡村的每人平均定量只比上一年度减少一尺多。我们认为，由于城市人民的衣着存底一般比农村厚，因此在棉布不够的时候，多减城市的定量、少减农村的定量是合理的。何况城市的棉布定量在减少了以后还并不比农村低，其中大城市由于照顾到购买力水平较高，还比农村的定量略多。棉布以外的衣着品，例如丝织品、麻织品、毛织品等，也是多数销于城市。我们相信城市人民是会谅解今年棉布供应减少的困难，接受政府所采取的分配措施的。
    第二、今年在分配办法上，取消过去职工、干部和中等学校以上学生定量高于当地居民的规定，改成与当地居民定量一致。我们认为在棉布供应减少的条件下，不再保持职工、干部、学生与居民的差距，提倡与居民同甘共苦，是适当的。只要经过宣传解释，职工、干部和学生是可以谅解国家的困难而与政府密切合作的。至于有些用布确多，而又不发工作服的工人，如筑路工人、建筑工人、煤矿工人等，各地可以根据具体情况在临时用布项目中给以必要的调剂和照顾。
    在工业用布上，就工业生产发展的需要来说，按理是应该有所增加的，但是由于今年棉布供应不足，为了保证民用布的供应，我们认为除了国家经济委员会批准必须增加的工业用布外，原则上应一律维持上一年度供应水平，不予增加。请各地人民委员会在核定指标范围内统筹安排，厉行节约，并且提倡代用和回收使用。机关、团体、企业、事业单位的公共用布，在今年实行节约以后，虽然已有所减少，但仍然存在一些浪费现象，还可以进一步节约。我们认为应当继续贯彻执行国务院今年1月30日关于节约公共用布的指示，务必做到机关、团体、企业、事业单位的设备用布在下一年度内一律不换新布，工作服应当提倡打补钉，尽可能不换新衣。
    由于去年棉田受灾减产，今年棉花种植面积减少，国家一再采取了减少棉布供应的措施，在人民生活上一定会感到一些困难。但是只要全国人民和政府密切合作，多多利用旧衣，少添新衣，在采取了以上的分配办法以后，这些困难是可以克服的。
    解放以来，我国的棉花年产量已经增加了很多。但是由于人民生活有了改善，棉布仍然供不应求。扩大棉田面积、提高棉田单位面积产量、利用其他纤维来供应衣着等办法，我们都要努力进行，但是这些措施，不可能在短期内收效。因此，在今后一个较长时期内，全国人民还需要继续节约用布。
    以上报告，请国务院审议。
