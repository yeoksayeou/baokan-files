Chengdu Dispatch from our Newspaper, August 20th. The anti-Party and anti-people crimes of Fan Puzhai and Zhang Zhihe, key members of the Zhang-Luo Alliance, members of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, State Councilors, and rightists, have recently been exposed at the Sichuan Provincial People's Congress.

    At a forum in the State Council, Fan Puzhai slandered, "The State Council is the root of bureaucracy." In an article in the Guangming Daily's "Outside Voices," he attacked the Party's policy of reforming intellectuals, saying that it "even changed human nature." When the rightist Tan Tigao sought advice from Fan on how to attack Lu Yuwen, Fan suggested to Tan, "In order to isolate the Communist Party, you must first strike at the activists," attempting to completely discredit Lu. On the night that this newspaper's editorial "What is the Reason?" was published, Tan went to Fan again. At that time, Fan slandered the editorial as "greatly unpopular." When the anti-rightist struggle began, Fan secretly plotted with rightists to form a united front, telling Luo Longji to "be sure to remain calm and not make things worse," and telling Pan Dakui to "must turn passive into active."

    Fan Puzhai, who rose to prominence by opposing the Communist Party, was promoted from an ordinary patrolman in a puppet police station to chief secretary and puppet Pingliang commissioner by Zhu Shaoliang, the puppet Gansu Province chairman, because of his vigorous anti-communism. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he and the Trotskyite Ye Qing were both political instructors in the puppet Sichuan Provincial Training Corps. After joining Luo Longji's anti-Communist clique, he actively sought to win over liaisons for them. In Sichuan, he contacted Zhang Songtao, Han Wenwei, and Liu Kunnan. In Shanghai, under the guise of inspection, he conveyed Luo's instructions to Peng Wenyin, Chen Renbing, and Zhao Wenbi, telling them to maintain "unity" and wait for the "opportunity." Last winter, after Luo Longji arrived in Chengdu, Fan used the excuse of inviting Luo Longji, Ma Zhemin, Pan Dakui, Zhang Songtao, and others to dinner to make specific plans for carrying out anti-Communist conspiracy activities in Sichuan and to specifically help Luo collect anti-Communist offensive materials.

    Zhang Zhihe, who slandered the Party during the blooming and contending period as "using ears instead of eyes and speaking irresponsibly" and constantly championed counter-revolutionaries, was a staunch executor of the Zhang-Luo alliance's military adventurist line. This ambitious man betrayed the Party during the tense moment after the failure of the Great Revolution, and used the blood of his comrades as his political capital for promotion. In 1930, while serving as a Kuomintang division commander, during the Jiangjin mutiny, he not only personally presided over the execution of more than sixty Communist Party members and soldiers, but also used needles to tattoo the characters "Communist Bandit" on the heads and hands of more than three hundred soldiers who remained and had not escaped, and then dyed the tattoos with indigo. On the eve of liberation, according to Zhang Bojun's instructions, in order to secede the southwest and prevent the People's Liberation Army from advancing into Sichuan and Xikang, Zhang recruited bandits and secret society armed forces everywhere in Ya'an, Yingjing, and Tianquan. The bandit leader Zhu Shizheng was appointed as the chairman of the China Democratic League in Xikang by them. These armed forces launched counter-revolutionary rebellions after liberation.

    At the meeting, although Fan and Zhang admitted some facts, they have not yet specifically accounted for their conspiracy activities.

### 四川又追获章罗联盟文武双将  范朴斋张志和策划反共阴谋暴露

    四川又追获章罗联盟文武双将
    范朴斋张志和策划反共阴谋暴露
    本报成都20日电　章罗联盟骨干、民盟中委、国务院参事、右派分子范朴斋张志和的反共反人民罪行，最近在四川省人代会上被揭露出来了。
    范朴斋在国务院座谈会上诬蔑“国务院是官僚主义的根源”，在光明日报“会外之音”一文中攻击党对知识分子的改造政策，“把人性也改掉了”。右派谭惕吾为打击卢郁文向范求计时，范向谭献策“为了孤立共产党，要先打击积极分子”，企图将卢一棍子打死。本报“这是为什么”社论发表的当天晚上，谭又去找范，范当时诬蔑这社论“大失人心”。反右派斗争开始，范暗地策划与右派分子订攻守同盟，叫罗隆基“务必镇静，不要把事情搞糟了”，叫潘大逵“必须变被动为主动”。
    靠反共起家的范朴斋，早年因反共有力，由伪警察局的一个普通巡官被伪甘肃省主席朱绍良提拔为幕僚长和伪平凉专员。抗战期间，与托匪叶青同为伪四川省训团的政治教官。参加罗隆基反共小集团后，积极为他们进行争取人联络人的活动。在四川联络张松涛、韩文畦、刘堃南，在上海借视察向彭文应、陈仁炳、赵文璧传达罗的旨意，叫他们保持“团结”，等待“时机”。去冬罗隆基到成都后，范借请罗隆基、马哲民、潘大逵、张松涛等吃饭为名，对如何在四川进行反共阴谋活动进行了具体策划，并具体帮助罗收集反共进攻材料。
    鸣放中诬蔑党“以耳代目，信口雌黄”不断为反革命分子叫冤的张志和是章罗联盟军事投机路线的坚决执行者。这个野心家在大革命失败后的紧张关头，叛变了党，并用同志们的鲜血作为他升官的政治资本。1930年任职国民党师长期间，在江津兵变中他不仅亲自升堂屠杀了六十多名共产党员和士兵，而且还对留下未及逃走的三百多士兵一个个在头上手上用针刺下“共匪”二字，并涂上蓝靛。解放前夕，张根据章伯钧指示，为割据西南，阻止解放军进军川康，在雅安、荥经、天全到处收编土匪哥老武装，土匪头子朱世正并被他们委任为民盟西康主委。这些武装在解放后都发动过反革命叛乱。
    在会上范张虽承认了一些事实，但对他们的阴谋活动还未具体交代。
