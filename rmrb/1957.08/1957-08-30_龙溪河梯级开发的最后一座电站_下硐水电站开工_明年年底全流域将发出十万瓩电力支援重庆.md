　　The Last Power Station of the Longxi River Cascade Development
　　Xia Tong Hydropower Station Begins Construction
　　By the End of Next Year, the Entire Basin Will Generate 100,000 Kilowatts of Electricity to Support Chongqing
    (Reported by this newspaper) According to Chongqing Daily: The Xia Tong Hydropower Station on the Longxi River, 100 kilometers east of Chongqing, has recently officially commenced construction. This is the last cascade power station to begin construction on the Longxi River after Shang Tong, Shizitan, and Huilongzhai since liberation. This hydropower station is nine times larger than the Xia Tong Hydropower Station built by the Kuomintang era nearby.
    The natural drop in the water flow in the Xia Tong area is very large, and the old hydropower station did not fully utilize its water power. The large reservoir built last year in Shizitan, with an area of 63 square kilometers, has also greatly increased the flood flow that can be used for power generation year-round. The construction of the Xia Tong Hydropower Station can fully utilize this water power. The construction of this hydropower station requires less investment, has a short construction period, and generates a large amount of electricity, making it one of the lowest-cost hydropower stations in the country. According to the person in charge of the project at the commencement ceremony, the total investment in the Xia Tong Hydropower Station is about one-sixth of that of the Shizitan Hydropower Station, while the power generation is equivalent to two-thirds of it. The entire construction period will only take a little over a year, and the entire investment can be recovered in two years of power generation.
    The original 3,000-kilowatt Xia Tong Hydropower Station was the largest hydropower station within Shanhaiguan before liberation. From 1938 to 1943, the Kuomintang reactionary government spent a lot of money to hire American engineers, using British and American equipment and steel, and concentrated the nation's hydropower construction talents, spending nearly five years to build this very small hydropower station. The currently being built, larger-scale Xia Tong Hydropower Station uses all domestically produced equipment and materials, and the construction force is only a part of the Shizitan Hydropower Engineering Bureau, and it can be completed in a little over a year. The construction situation of these two hydropower stations forms a sharp contrast between the old and new eras.
    Currently, the finishing touches of the Shizitan Hydropower Station, the Huilongzhai Hydropower Station, and the Xia Tong Hydropower Station are progressing simultaneously. It is expected that by the fourth quarter of next year, the cascade development of the entire Longxi River basin, which Chinese hydropower builders have dreamed of for decades, will be perfectly realized, and the entire Longxi River can generate more than 100,000 kilowatts of huge power, meeting the needs of the increasingly developed industrial electricity consumption in the Chongqing area.

　　龙溪河梯级开发的最后一座电站
　　下硐水电站开工
　　明年年底全流域将发出十万瓩电力支援重庆
    本报讯　据重庆日报消息：重庆以东一百公里的龙溪河下硐水电站最近正式开工了。这是解放以后在龙溪河上继上硐、狮子滩、回龙寨之后最后开工的一座梯级电站。这个水电站比它附近的国民党时代兴建的下硐水电站要大九倍。
    下硐地区水流的天然落差很大，旧的水电站还没有充分利用它的水力；去年在狮子滩修建的面积达六十三平方公里的大水库，也使常年可以用来发电的洪水流量大大增加。兴建下硐水电站可以充分利用这些水力。修建这座水电站的投资少，工期短，发电量大，是全国现有水电站中造价最低的一个。据工程负责人在开工典礼大会上宣布，下硐水电站全部投资约为狮子滩水电站的六分之一，而发电量相当于它的三分之二。全部工程施工期只要一年多，发电两年即可收回全部投资。
    原有的三千瓩的下硐水电站，是解放前山海关内最大的一个水电站。在1938年到1943年间，国民党反动政府用重金聘请美国工程师，采用英美的设备和钢材，集中全国水电建设人才，花了将近五年的时间，才建成了这个规模很小的水电站。现在兴建的规模更大的下硐水电站，采用的全是国产设备和器材，施工力量只是狮子滩水力发电工程局的一部分，一年多便可完成。这两座水电站的修建情形，形成了新旧两个时代的鲜明对比。
    现在，狮子滩水电站的收尾工程、回龙寨水电站和下硐水电站的工程正在齐头并进。预计到明年第四季度，我国水电建设者几十年来梦想的龙溪河全流域的梯级开发便将完满实现，整个龙溪河便可发出十万瓩多的巨大电力，满足重庆地区日益发展的工业用电的需要。
