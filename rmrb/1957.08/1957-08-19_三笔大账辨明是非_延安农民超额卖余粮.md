    Three Accounts Clarify Right and Wrong
    Yan'an Peasants Oversell Surplus Grain
    (Our Dispatch) According to the *Shaanxi Daily*, after the widespread socialist education campaign, Yan'an County has overfulfilled its summer tax and purchase tasks by 14.7%. Now, agricultural cooperatives are launching a summer grain storage competition, with each district guaranteeing to complete the storage task by August 15th, a month earlier than last year. This situation has not occurred in the past four or five years.
    Since the beginning of this year, some peasants in Yan'an County felt that peasants toil in the fields every day, yet their grain retention standard is not as high as that of workers and urban residents, and they have objections to the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain. In addition, due to reduced wheat production in some areas due to disasters this year, when the summer grain tax and purchase tasks were announced in early July, some disaster-stricken townships and cooperatives complained that they could not complete the tasks because the task allocation was not entirely reasonable; many peasants who had not experienced reduced production, caring only for themselves and not for the country, also joined in complaining that they could not complete the tasks in order to retain more wheat.
    The Yan'an County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party studied the above situation and, on July 20th, mobilized nearly 300 cadres from the county, district, and township levels to go deep into the countryside to carry out socialist propaganda among the peasants, explaining the relationship between the state, the collective, and the members, and clarifying three situations. First, the grain consumption situation: In Yan'an County, a worker's family of five includes one cadre who receives 31 catties per month, one family member who receives 27.5 catties, one person over eight years old who receives 24 catties, one five-year-old who receives 16 catties, and one three-year-old who receives 10 catties, all converted into 1,429 catties of trade grain. A peasant family is also calculated as five people, each receiving 375 catties per year, converted into 318 catties of trade grain, for a total of 1,590 catties for five people per year, which is 161 catties higher than a worker's family. This account made the peasants realize that the grain retention standard for peasants is not lower than that for workers and urban residents; moreover, peasants have surplus grain after taxes, purchases, and deduction of rations, and there is also a small amount of grain exchange among peasants, while workers and urban residents have only one source of supply from the state. Second, the grain purchase and sale situation in Yan'an County: In 1954, the state purchased 7.34 million catties of grain in Yan'an County and sold 13.88 million catties; in 1955, it purchased more than 5.07 million catties and sold more than 15.48 million catties; in 1956, it purchased 5.1 million catties and sold more than 18.47 million catties. The amount of purchase basically decreased year by year, and the amount of unified sales increased year by year, and the sales were more than the purchase by one or two times. This account explained to the peasants that Yan'an County's grain mainly relies on supply from other places. Guaranteeing socialist construction and selling surplus grain is the responsibility of every peasant. How can they only want to buy from the state and not sell to the state? Finally, the wheat harvest situation this year: According to the general yield measurement, the best wheat harvest this year was in Chengguan District, with a yield of 102 catties per mu, 84 catties in Hezhuangping District, and the lowest yield in Ganguyi District reached 51 catties per mu, while last year (a bumper year) the average yield in the county was only 83 catties per mu. This account made everyone realize that although this year's harvest is not very good, it is not that bad either, and they should not blindly shout about it because of reduced production in individual areas.
    On the basis of clarifying the situation and explaining the reasons, the tasks of individual disaster-stricken townships and cooperatives were adjusted, and the peasants' individualism and departmentalism were transformed, and they reported the actual acreage and output. The Jiejia Gou Agricultural Cooperative in Hezhuangping District planted 48 mu of wheat, but originally reported only 23 mu. After education, they reported the truth. In this district alone, more than 650 mu of concealed wheat land were reported. Those who originally thought it would be difficult to complete the purchase tasks also overfulfilled them. Linzhen was assigned a task of more than 220,000 catties and completed more than 250,000 catties; Hezhuangping District was assigned a task of more than 140,000 catties and completed more than 180,000 catties.
    Now, a upsurge in delivering public grain has been set off throughout the county. The county originally stipulated that summer grain should begin to be stored in warehouses from August 1st, but the townships began to deliver grain on July 28th. The Dongfanghong Agricultural Cooperative in Liulin Township delivered all the borrowed grain into the warehouse at one time. Ganguyi Township, which was originally considered to have the most serious problems, completed all the warehousing tasks by August 5th.

### 三笔大账辨明是非  延安农民超额卖余粮

    三笔大账辨明是非
    延安农民超额卖余粮
    本报讯　据陕西日报报道：在普遍开展社会主义宣传教育以后，延安县今年的夏征、夏购任务已超额14.7％完成。现在各农业社正在展开夏粮入仓竞赛，各区都保证在8月15日前全部完成入仓任务，比去年提早一个月。这种情况是四、五年以来所没有的。
    今年以来，延安县有些农民认为农民天天上山种地，留粮标准反不如职工和城镇居民多，对粮食统购统销政策有意见。加上今年部分地区的小麦因灾减产，因此当7月初夏粮征、购任务宣布后，个别受灾乡、社因任务分配不完全合理，便喊叫完不成；不少本来没有减产的农民由于只顾自己不顾国家，为了多留麦子，便也跟着喊叫完不成。
    中共延安县委研究了上述情况，就在7月20日动员了县、区、乡三级干部近三百名，深入农村，向农民开展社会主义宣传，说明国家、社和社员三者的关系，讲清了三种情况。首先是粮食消费情况：延安县的职工家属一户以五人计，其中干部一人每月三十一斤，家属一人二十七斤半，年满八岁的一人二十四斤，五岁一人十六斤，三岁一人十斤，全部折成贸易粮为一千四百二十九斤。农民一户也以五人计，每人每年三百七十五斤，折成贸易粮三百一十八斤，五人全年为一千五百九十斤，比职工一户高出一百六十一斤。这一笔账使农民认识到农民的留粮标准并不低于职工和城市居民；何况农民在征、购和扣除口粮外还有余粮，农民之间还有少量粮食往来，而职工和城市居民只有国家供应一个来源。其次是延安县的粮食购销情况：1954年国家在延安县征购粮食七百三十四万斤，销售一千三百八十八万多斤；1955年征购五百零七万多斤，销售一千五百四十八万多斤；1956年征购五百一十万斤，销售一千八百四十七万多斤。征购数量基本上逐年减少，统销数量逐年增加，而且销大于购都在一倍或二倍以上。这笔账向农民说清延安县的粮食主要是依靠外地供给的。保证社会主义建设，出售余粮，农民人人有责，岂能光想买国家的，不愿卖给国家？最后是今年小麦的收成情况：据普遍测产，今年小麦收成最好的城关区亩产一百零二斤，河庄坪区八十四斤，产量最低的甘谷驿区，亩产也达五十一斤，而去年（丰收年）全县平均产量每亩也只八十三斤。这笔账使大家认识到今年的收成虽不很好，但也不怎么坏，不能因个别地区减产而盲目叫喊。
    在讲清情况说明道理的基础上，又对个别受灾乡、社的任务作了调整，农民的个人主义和本位主义思想有了转变，纷纷报实地亩、产量。河庄坪区解家沟农业社种麦四十八亩，原只报为二十三亩，经教育后报实了。仅这一个区就报出了隐瞒的麦地六百五十多亩。原来认为难以完成征购任务的也纷纷超额完成，临镇分配任务二十二万多斤，完成了二十五万多斤；河庄坪区分配任务十四万多斤，完成了十八万多斤。
    现在，一个送交公粮的热潮已在全县掀起。县上原规定从8月1日起夏粮开始入仓，但各乡在7月28日就开始送粮了。柳林乡东方红农业社全部借购粮一次入了仓。原来认为问题最严重的甘谷驿乡，到8月5日就全部完成了入仓任务。
