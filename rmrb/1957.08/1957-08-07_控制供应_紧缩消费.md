    Control Supply, Tighten Consumption
    The Jiangxi Daily published an editorial on the 3rd, calling on farmers throughout the province to continue to use grain sparingly after the new grain comes on the market.

    The editorial pointed out that after the new grain entered the market, many areas had seen wasteful phenomena such as large-scale brewing and sugar boiling, and there were also activities using grain for other speculative transactions. Some farmers in some areas, after harvesting wheat, not only did not sell the wheat to the state to complete part of the grain unified purchase task, but instead used it extensively for grain sideline businesses. Some areas have relaxed the management of grain supply, so that after the new grain is on the market, the number of grain supplies still accounts for 60-70% of the rural population.

    In order to reverse the above situation, the editorial believes that we should seize the current period before and after the new grain harvest and continue to conduct a universal and in-depth policy and ideological education for farmers, educate farmers to save grain and abide by the state’s unified grain purchase and sale policy, especially persuade farmers not to engage in illegal grain black market activities and not to use rations for sideline businesses. All cadres in the province must use their own exemplary actions of saving grain to influence the masses.

    The editorial believes that in order to save grain, serious control should also be carried out from the supply side.

### 控制供应　紧缩消费

    控制供应　紧缩消费
    江西日报3日发表社论，号召全省农民在新谷登场后继续节约使用粮食。
    社论指出，目前新粮上市后，不少地区已出现大量酿酒、熬糖等浪费粮食的现象，还有使用粮食做其他投机性买卖的活动。有些地区的农民在收割小麦后，不仅没有把小麦交售给国家，以完成一部分粮食统购任务，反而大量地用作经营粮食副业。有些地区放松了粮食供应的管理，以致在新粮上市后粮食供应数仍占农村人口的60—70％。
    为了扭转上述情况，社论认为，应抓紧当前新粮收获前后，继续对农民进行一次普遍深入的政策思想教育工作，教育农民节约粮食和遵守国家粮食统购统销政策，特别是说服劝止农民不要违法搞粮食黑市活动，不要以口粮搞副业。全省干部，要用自己带头节约粮食的模范行动去影响群众。
    社论认为，为了节约粮食，还应该从供应方面认真加以控制。
