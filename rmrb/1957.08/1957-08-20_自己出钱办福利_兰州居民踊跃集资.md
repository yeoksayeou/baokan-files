    Funding Welfare Themselves
    Lanzhou Residents Enthusiastically Raise Funds

    (Our report) According to the Gansu Daily: The social welfare fundraising work in Lanzhou city, which aims to organize mass funds to build social welfare undertakings, has been widely carried out. Various organizations, groups, and people of all ethnic groups and from all walks of life are constantly and enthusiastically subscribing for shares. As of late July, the thirteen fundraising branches, including the Provincial Party Committee, had already subscribed for 320,000 yuan worth of shares.

    902 employees from 28 units in the Chengguan District subscribed for more than 19,400 yuan; farmers and residents in the Donggang District have subscribed for more than 27,800 yuan, with resident Cao Yijun subscribing for 1,000 yuan alone; nine street offices in the Chengguan District have 3,150 people subscribing for shares, totaling more than 32,000 yuan. The person in charge of the Municipal Fundraising Committee said that as long as the leadership attaches importance and does a good job in publicity, it is entirely possible to complete the fundraising plan of one million yuan in the city by October.

    The development of social welfare fundraising in Lanzhou has attracted close attention from other regions. Since the People's Daily and Gansu Daily published news about the social welfare fundraising work in Lanzhou, the Lanzhou Municipal Fundraising Committee has received official letters from units such as the Datong Municipal People's Committee of Shanxi Province, the Jiaxing Municipal People's Committee of Zhejiang Province, and the Zhongwei County Service Bureau, requesting an introduction to their experiences.

    自己出钱办福利
    兰州居民踊跃集资
    本报讯　据甘肃日报消息：兰州市组织群众资金兴建社会福利事业的社会福利集资工作，已经广泛开展。各机关、团体和各族各界人民不断踊跃认股。到7月下旬，省委等十三集资分会，已经认股三十二万元。
    城关区二十八个单位的九百零二名职工认股一万九千四百多元；东岗区的农民和居民已经认股二万七千八百多元，居民曹宜君一人就认股一千元；城关区九个街道办事处认股人数达三千一百五十人，认股三万二千多元。市集资委员会负责人说，只要领导重视，做好宣传工作，全市在10月间完成一百万元的集资计划是完全可能的。
    兰州市社会福利事业集资工作的开展，引起了其它地区的密切注意。自从人民日报和甘肃日报发表了兰州市开展社会福利集资工作的消息以后，兰州市集资委员会曾收到了山西省大同市人民委员会、浙江省嘉兴市人民委员会、中卫县服务局等单位的公函，要求介绍经验。
