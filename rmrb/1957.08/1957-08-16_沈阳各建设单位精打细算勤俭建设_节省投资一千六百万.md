    Shenyang, August 15th (By our own correspondent) – More than eighty basic construction units, including Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant and Shenyang Transformer Factory, recently carefully reviewed and revised their 1957 basic construction plans, saving the state more than 16 million yuan in investment.

    The original factory renovation plan of the Shenyang Railway Signal Factory proposed to build 25 new construction projects such as large canteens and dormitories. After review, it was decided to only renovate the canteen and reduce the number of dormitories by one, cutting 15 construction projects and saving more than 170,000 yuan in investment. The cadre school of the Third Machinery Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building originally planned to buy several metal cutting machine tools for teaching purposes. Recent studies have shown that using wall charts for teaching eliminates the need to buy machines. One factory originally planned to purchase more than 400 pieces of non-standard equipment and 40 vehicles. After discussions among the masses, they decided to give full play to the role of existing equipment and only buy 60 pieces of non-standard equipment and one vehicle. These two items alone saved the state 1.38 million yuan.

    沈阳各建设单位精打细算勤俭建设
    节省投资一千六百万
    本报沈阳15日电  沈阳重型机器厂、沈阳变压器厂等八十多个基本建设单位，最近认真审查和修改了1957年的基本建设计划，给国家节省了一千六百多万元的投资。
    沈阳铁路信号厂原订的工厂改建计划，曾经提出要新建大食堂、宿舍等二十五项工程项目。经过审查，决定食堂只进行改建，宿舍减少一栋，共削减了十五项工程，节省投资十七万多元。第一机械工业部第三机械局的干部学校，原计划买几台金属切削机床供教学使用。最近研究出用挂图教学，不买机器了。有一个工厂原计划购置四百多台非标准设备和四十辆汽车，后经群众讨论，充分发挥现有设备的作用，只买六十台非标准设备和一辆汽车就可以了。仅这两项就为国家节省一百三十八万元资金。
