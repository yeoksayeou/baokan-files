Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, August 29th: The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region held a regional rural work conference in mid-to-late August to specifically study how to comprehensively carry out the socialist education movement in agricultural and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, and arranged various rural tasks before and after the autumn harvest distribution.

The meeting determined that before the autumn harvest distribution, the focus should be on debating the issues of unified purchase and sale of grain and other agricultural products, the superiority of cooperation, and the democracy and centralization of cooperatives. This major debate should be closely linked to production, and it is advocated that debate meetings be held in the fields. At the same time, it will also be combined with criticizing the Han chauvinism and local nationalism of rural cadres and members of all ethnic groups to enhance the unity of the people of all ethnic groups.

　  内蒙古提倡田间辩论会
    据新华社呼和浩特29日电　内蒙古自治区在8月中下旬举行全区农村工作会议，具体地研究如何在农业区、半农半牧区全面开展社会主义教育运动，并将秋收分配前后各项农村工作作了安排。
    会议确定：在秋收分配以前着重辩论关于粮食及其他农产品的统购统销问题，合作化的优越性问题和合作社的民主与集中问题。这次大辩论应该紧密结合生产，提倡辩论会到田间去开。同时，还将结合批判农村各族干部和社员的大民族主义和地方民族主义思想，增强各民族人民的团结。
