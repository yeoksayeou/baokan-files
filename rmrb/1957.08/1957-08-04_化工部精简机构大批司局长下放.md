The Ministry of Chemical Industry, while engaged in intense anti-rightist struggle, also pays attention to studying the opinions of the masses and implementing the spirit of rectifying and correcting simultaneously. In a recent ministerial meeting, it approved a decision on improving enterprise management and streamlining the ministry's agencies. According to this decision, the number of personnel in the ministry will be reduced from 1,421 to 800; the existing 21 departments and bureaus will be merged into 12 units. Seventeen bureau and department-level cadres and eleven section-level cadres will be transferred to subordinate enterprises and institutions.

After the start of the rectification campaign, the Party Group of the Ministry of Chemical Industry, in accordance with the spirit of rectifying and correcting simultaneously, conducted multiple analyses and studies of the ministry's structure. They believed that the ministry's structure was overlapping, official documents traveled back and forth, people shirked responsibility, and the situation of overstaffing was quite serious. Because many matters were concentrated in the various administrative bureaus, local enterprises and institutions had to come to Beijing to ask for instructions and discuss matters, resulting in more documents and meetings. The guesthouse was often filled with people coming to the ministry to ask for instructions or attend meetings. Also, due to attention being paid to strengthening the leadership of the ministry's agencies, the number of cadres in production units was relatively weakened. For example, the Yongli Chemical Company's Tanggu Soda Plant, a large factory with thousands of workers affiliated with the ministry, was only assigned one factory director. Many matters were backlogged for a long time without being dealt with, and when something happened, they had to ask the ministry and the bureau for instructions. This not only delayed the time to solve problems, but also because the ministry and bureau did not have enough understanding of the specific situation below, some instructions were not completely correct.

The Party Group of the Ministry of Chemical Industry focused on analyzing two aspects of the situation. On the one hand, the development direction of the chemical industry must be comprehensive utilization; some large cities will establish local management agencies, and some regions will become chemical industry bases, establishing chemical enterprise joint companies. Strengthening local leadership determines that cadres must be transferred downward. On the other hand, during the Second Five-Year Plan period, chemical fertilizer production is required to increase by eight or nine times. It would be difficult to complete the task without strengthening the leadership of enterprise units. The Party Group and the Ministry Affairs Committee studied this situation and decided to abolish the Cadre Department, the Labor and Wage Department, and the Education Department, and establish a Personnel Department to uniformly manage the original three departments' business; to abolish the Equipment Bureau, the Safety Department, the Design Bureau, and the Geological and Mining Bureau, and merge their business into the Basic Construction Department, the Production Department, the Technology Department, and other units. Some departments, bureaus, and offices remain unchanged in their organizational structure, but the structure needs to be streamlined. With such mergers and adjustments, the business managed by the departments and bureaus is more concentrated; and 40% of the leading cadres at the bureau and department director level and 50% of the section-level cadres can be transferred downward. Generally, no section-level leading bodies are established in the departments. Vice ministers and assistant ministers concurrently serve as department directors or directors of the general office. Efforts will be made to reduce personnel and draw more cadres to transfer downward to enterprises or institutions. Corresponding adjustments will also be made to the infrastructure, planning, technology, supply and marketing departments, and appropriate strengthening will be made in terms of personnel, staffing, and cadre quality according to future tasks.

### 化工部精简机构大批司局长下放

    化工部精简机构大批司局长下放
    本报讯　化学工业部在紧张的反右派斗争中，同时注意研究群众意见，贯彻边整边改的精神，在最近的一次部务会议上，通过了关于改进企业的管理和精简部局机关的决定。根据这个决定，这个部的编制人员将由一千四百二十一人，减缩到八百人；现有的二十一个司局单位将合并成十二个单位。将有十七个司局长级干部，十一个处长级干部，下放到所属企业和事业部门。
    整风开始以后，中共化学工业部党组根据边整边改的精神，对部局机构作了多次的分析研究，认为部的机构重叠，公文旅行，互相推诿，人浮于事的情况是相当严重的。由于许多事情都集中在各管理局，各地企业及事业部门有了问题，都得上北京请示商讨，这样，公文来往多了，会议多了。招待所经常住满了到部里请示工作或参加会议的人员。也由于注意了充实部局领导，生产单位的干部就相对地减弱了。如这个部所属的永利化学公司塘沽碱厂是个数千人的大厂，只配有一个厂长，许多事情积压许久未作处理，有了事就要找部、局请示，这样不仅拖延了解决问题的时间，而且由于部局对下面的具体情况了解不够，有些指示也就不完全正确。
    中共化工部党组着重分析了两方面的情况，一方面是化学工业的发展方向必须是综合利用；有些大城市就要成立地方管理机构，有些地区要成为化工基地，建立化工企业联合公司。加强地方上的领导，这就决定了干部必须下放。另一方面，在第二个五年计划期间，化学肥料要求增长八、九倍，不加强企业单位的领导，要想完成任务是有困难的。党组和部务委员会研究了这个情况，决定撤销干部司、劳动工资司、教育司，建立人事司，统一管理原有三个司的业务；撤销设备局、安全司、设计局、地质矿山局，其业务合并于基本建设司、生产司、技术司等单位。有些司局厅室，建制仍然不变，但机构需要紧缩。这样的合并调整，司局所管理的业务是更加集中了；而领导干部，司局长级可以下放40％，处长级干部可以下放50％。各司一般不设处一级领导机构，副部长和部长助理兼任司长或办公厅主任。力求减少人员，抽出更多的干部，下放到企业或事业部门。对基建、计划、技术、供销等部门，也作了相应的调整，在人员、编制、干部质量方面，根据今后的任务，作适当的加强。
