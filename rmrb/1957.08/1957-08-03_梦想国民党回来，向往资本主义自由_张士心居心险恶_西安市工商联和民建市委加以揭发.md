Dreaming of the Kuomintang's Return, Yearning for Capitalist Freedom
Zhang Shixin's Sinister Intentions Exposed by Xi'an Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Municipal Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association

(By our reporter) The Xi'an Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association have held successive meetings to expose and criticize the reactionary words and deeds of rightist Zhang Shixin, Deputy Chairman of the Xi'an Federation of Industry and Commerce.

Zhang Shixin has consistently been deeply attached to and yearned for capitalism. He said that in a capitalist society, as long as you have money, you have freedom; in the new society, there is no individual freedom. Within the Federation of Industry and Commerce, Zhang Shixin always tried to squeeze out the Communist Party member serving as Secretary-General and stir up trouble between the cadres and this Secretary-General. As the Deputy Chairman of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, when some industrial and commercial households wanted to withdraw funds, Zhang not only did not dissuade them but even said, "The business should be managed by the owner, and withdrawing funds is no big deal." He also planned to incite some people to withdraw from joint ventures and set up underground factories. Zhang Shixin even wantonly attacked the Three-Anti Movement for persecuting embezzlers to the point of being "too horrible to look at," and slandered the People's Government's tax collection work as "extortion and oppression."

Before liberation, Zhang had already become sworn brothers with Wang Xinmin, the Kuomintang's spy chief in Xi'an, and others. After liberation, he secretly harbored counter-revolutionaries. He once sent a batch of daily necessities to the Kuomintang bandit army of Yang Zhijian entrenched in the southern mountains, and provided financial assistance to the families of counter-revolutionaries, hoping that these counter-revolutionaries would "return" in the future and find a way out for him.

    梦想国民党回来，向往资本主义自由
    张士心居心险恶 
    西安市工商联和民建市委加以揭发
    本报讯　西安市工商联和民建西安市委员会连续举行会议，揭发和批判右派分子、西安市工商联副主任委员张士心的反动言行。
    张士心一贯对资本主义十分留恋和向往，他说，在资本主义社会，只要有钱，就有自由；在新社会却没有个人自由。张士心在工商联内，总想挤走当秘书长的共产党员，挑拨干部同这位秘书长之间的关系。张士心身为工商联副主委，工商业户有人想抽逃资金，张不但不劝止，还说什么“业要由主，抽逃资金算不了什么。”他还打算煽动一些人退出合营企业，搞地下工厂。张士心更肆意攻击三反运动把贪污分子整的“惨不忍睹”，又诬蔑人民政府的税收工作是“横征暴敛”。
    解放前张即和国民党在西安的特务头子王新民等结为把弟兄。解放后，他暗中包庇反革命分子。曾经送了一批日用品给盘据在南山的国民党匪军杨志俭部队，以及给反革命分子的家属接济财物，希望将来这些反革命分子“回来”时给自己找出路。
