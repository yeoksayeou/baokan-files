Leveling Cloth Rationing with Farmers

Wuhan Stipulates Cadres Above Deputy Section Chief Receive a Fixed Ration of Nine Feet Each in the First Half of the Fourth Year

(Our newspaper's Wuhan dispatch on the 13th) The Wuhan Municipal People's Committee has stipulated that in the first half of the fourth year of planned cotton cloth supply, cloth rations for cadres at or above the deputy section chief level will be aligned with those of farmers, with a uniform quota of nine feet per person. This regulation covers all levels of state organs, party and mass organizations, industrial and mining enterprises, schools, and institutions stationed in the city. Cadres at or above the deputy section chief level will receive five feet less cloth rationing per person than workers, students, residents, and general cadres in the urban area. Before formally enacting this regulation, the Wuhan Municipal People's Committee widely solicited opinions from more than 200 larger units throughout the city. After holding symposiums for cadres at or above the deputy section chief level, these units responded to the Municipal People's Committee in writing or by telephone, expressing their determination to carry forward the revolutionary tradition of state cadres enduring hardship before enjoying comforts, sharing weal and woe with the people, and resolutely supporting this regulation. Some cadres also indicated that they would, based on their own circumstances, voluntarily forgo or reduce their cloth rations when they are distributed, in order to help the state overcome this temporary difficulty.

    把布票供应数量和农民拉平
    武汉市规定在第四年度前期中副科长以上干部每人定量九尺
    本报武汉13日电　武汉市人民委员会规定在棉布计划供应第四年度前期中，将副科长以上干部的布票和农民拉平，每人定量一律九尺。这个规定包括该市和驻在该市的各级国家机关、党群团体、工矿企业、学校和事业单位在内。副科长以上干部比市区内的职工、学生、居民和一般干部，每人要少领五尺布票。武汉市人民委员会在正式作出这项规定以前，曾向全市二百多个较大的单位广泛征求意见。这些单位在召开副科长以上干部的座谈会后，都纷纷用书面或电话答复市人委，表示要发扬国家干部吃苦在前、得利在后的革命传统，同人民群众共甘苦，坚决拥护这项规定。有些干部还表示要根据自己的实际情况，在发放布票时，自动不领或少领，帮助国家克服这个暂时的困难。
