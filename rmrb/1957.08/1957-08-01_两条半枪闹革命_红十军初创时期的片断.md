Two and a Half Guns Making Revolution
——Fragments from the Early Days of the Red Tenth Army
Shào Shìpíng

Following the Nanchang Uprising, in late 1927, the peasants of Yiyang and Hengfeng counties in the Gan Northeast region, under the leadership of the Party headed by Comrade Fang Zhimin, also raised the red flag of armed uprising.

Not long after the uprising, the enemy sent a regiment specifically to deal with the insurgent peasants. Of course, the enemy was dominant at that time. The peasant uprising forces, nominally, had "Five Route Columns," but three of the five routes each had one gun, and one of the rifles had half of its barrel cut off. Hence the saying: Fang Zhimin making revolution with two and a half guns. As for the other two routes, they didn't even have one gun; the insurgent peasants fought the enemy with spears.

By May and June of 1928, the situation was getting more serious day by day. There were more and more enemies. With those few guns, we roamed around in the mountains, confronting the enemy for a full month. The enemy pressed on step by step, and our guerrilla area became smaller and smaller. Gradually, we retreated to the central area.

At that time, our central area was in Mopan Mountain. It is located between Yiyang, Hengfeng, and Dexing counties, and is the main peak of the Huaiyu Mountains. We could say that we were surrounded in this small area. The local reactionaries also became rampant. Wherever we went, the enemy immediately knew and followed us. We circled around with the enemy every day, so nervous that we couldn't eat during the day or sleep at night.

How to deal with the enemy? Everyone's opinions differed greatly. Some people showed wavering emotions, advocating disbanding the troops and burying the guns underground; some advocated transferring to an active area and jumping out of the enemy's encirclement; and some advocated fighting the enemy head-on. There were many different opinions. At this time, Comrade Fang Zhimin decided to convene a cadre meeting of Yiyang and Hengfeng counties to resolve the issue. The meeting place was chosen in a place that the enemy would not notice. This place was called Fang Sheng Peak. Fang Sheng Peak is a small mountain on the border of Hengfeng and Yiyang counties. There is a desolate, dilapidated temple on the mountain, and few people go there.

Taking advantage of the dark night, we quietly went down the mountain. By the time we reached the foot of the mountain, it was almost dawn. We slipped past the enemy's posts one by one, without being discovered. The enemy was in the middle of changing guards and didn't notice. They assumed that we were still surrounded on the mountaintop, but they didn't know that we had arrived at Fang Sheng Peak safe and sound.

Everyone was extremely tired when they arrived at Fang Sheng Peak, because they had been up all night without rest. As soon as their bodies hit the ground, they all fell asleep. They didn't wake up until noon to start the meeting. I remember that more than twenty comrades participated in this meeting, including Fang Zhimin, me, Huang Dao, Zou Xiufeng, Wu Xianmin, and Fang Zhichun. Among them was a comrade from Huang'an (now Hong'an County) in Hubei. I can't remember his name, so let's just call him Comrade Huang'an.

Comrade Fang Zhimin served as the chairman of the meeting. The debate at the meeting was very fierce. Comrade Huang'an advocated burying the guns and disbanding the troops. His reason was: more than two hundred uprisings had been launched in various provinces, and they had all failed one after another. Because he came from Huang'an, he also brought the experience of the failure of the Huang'an uprising.

Comrade Fang Zhimin firmly opposed this escape method. He said: "The masses here are making revolution with us. If we bury the guns and escape in times of difficulty, the masses will sacrifice too much. Abandoning the masses and running away is not the attitude that a Communist Party member should have. Communist Party members should share weal and woe with the masses. ... Anyone who doesn't recognize himself as a Communist Party member can leave! We are not leaving. We will resolutely fight alongside the masses."

Everyone agreed with Comrade Fang Zhimin's words. The meeting then discussed the second opinion: advocating taking the guns and leaving the enemy's encirclement, luring the enemy out of the base area, and then coming back. The discussion quickly came to a conclusion. It was unanimously agreed that in the base area, we had the masses to rely on. If we transferred to a new area, we would be unfamiliar with both the people and the place, wouldn't we be courting our own destruction? Furthermore, even if we lured the enemy out of the base area, when we came back, wouldn't the enemy still follow us back? Luring them here and there wouldn't solve the problem at all.

Finally, it was decided that we must persist in the struggle. Comrade Fang Zhimin analyzed the situation in detail. He said: "We haven't formally fought the enemy yet, and now the enemy's forces are very scattered, and the masses don't support them. If we really fight, we may not be able to defeat them. As for the enemy's intelligence being good, following us closely, that's because there are still reactionaries in the base area. We can't leave even if we want to. There is only fighting. Furthermore, in the event of extreme necessity, we must transfer our positions, but we must make some arrangements beforehand and do mass work in the new area first. If we can't win the battle, we can transfer according to the arranged steps..."

After listening to Comrade Fang Zhimin's specific analysis, the atmosphere of advocating persistence in the struggle became stronger. The comrades were filled with new confidence and unanimously prepared to fight. Then, we began to study the enemy's situation: At that time, what was surrounding us was the enemy's main regiment and the local forces' Jingwei Regiment. All those who attacked our central area and areas with a solid working foundation were the enemy's main forces; in areas where our work was relatively weak, the local Jingwei Regiment would attack. Based on this situation, we selected the Jingwei Regiment on the Yiyang route, because this route was the most hated by the masses, and the masses had asked us to attack it. Attacking it would win over the broad masses.

Once the target of the attack was determined, we then studied the division of labor. At that time, we had a total of forty-six rifles. Six were given to Comrade Fang Zhimin, who was responsible for suppressing the arrogance of the reactionaries. The remaining forty guns were given to me to take to fight the enemy.

That night, the troops went down the mountain. It was still raining. We walked in the rain until dawn. I went to Jinji Mountain first to wait for the troops, but the troops didn't come. It turned out that at this time, the spirit of the Fang Sheng Peak meeting had not yet been conveyed to the troops, and the morale was not very good; at the same time, the soldiers saw that this mountain was bare, with no place to hide, so they stopped at the foot of the mountain, afraid to come up. After I found out, I ran to mobilize them and told everyone about the decision at the meeting, and the morale of the soldiers suddenly rose. But before I finished speaking, news came that the enemy was coming!

We hid in the bamboo forest. Looking down from above, there was a sea of fire for more than ten miles. A company of the enemy came out of Guogangbu, driving more than ten thousand peasants who had betrayed us from inside and outside the base area, burning and killing along the way. The masses, helping the old and carrying the young, fled in panic all over the mountains. Watching the enemy chase past us, our troops circled behind the enemy and unexpectedly killed them. In an instant, a company of the Jingwei Regiment was crushed, and tens of thousands of rebelling peasants were even more disorganized. The enemy turned around and fled back the way they came. The spears in the hands of the people behind poked into the buttocks of the people in front, and the people in front shouted like pigs being slaughtered: "Red Army comrades, I was captured!"

In an instant, the masses who had been chased by the enemy also turned around and helped us fight. The surrounding mountains were filled with red flags, and the shouts of killing were deafening, making the enemy unable to figure out how many Red Army soldiers there were.

The enemy retreated to the road they came from, and we took advantage of the victory to pursue them, stopping only after chasing them for fifty miles.

This battle shocked the entire Yiyang city, and everyone thought that the Red Army was going to attack the city. The city was in chaos. The pseudo-county head was afraid of death and fled out of the south gate upon hearing the news. Many people in the city were crowding to cross the floating bridge. There were too many people, and some were squeezed into the river and drowned. It's a pity that we didn't know the situation in the city at the time, and we only fired a few rows of guns at the city from outside the city before leaving.

Following the Jinji Mountain battle, we successively fought two more ambush battles in Zhangshudun and Hujiadun, both of which were victorious.

The policy of persisting in the struggle was victorious, and our Red Army also developed and grew in constant struggle, and was reorganized into the "Jiangxi Independent Fifth Regiment of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army."

    两条半枪闹革命
    ——红十军初创时期的片断
    邵式平
    南昌起义后，1927年底，赣东北地区，弋阳、横峰两县的农民，在以方志敏同志为首的党的领导下，也高举起武装起义的红旗。
    起义后不久，敌人就开来了一个团，专门来对付起义的农民。当然，那时敌人是占优势的。农民的起义队伍，名义上说来，也有“五路纵队”，但五路当中，三路各有一条枪，其中一条步枪还被截去半段枪管。所以后来说成：方志敏两条半枪闹革命。至于其他两路，则连一条枪也没有，起义的农民，手执着梭标同敌人打仗。
    到1928年5、6月间，形势一天天严重了，敌人越来越多，我们凭着那么几条枪，在山上游来游去，跟敌人足足对抗了一个月。敌人步步进逼，我们的游击地区越来越小，渐渐地，我们退缩到了中心地区。
    那时，我们的中心地区是在磨盘山。它位在弋阳、横峰、德兴三县之间，是怀玉山脉的主峰。我们可以说是被包围在这块小小的地方。当地的反动派，也嚣张起来。我们走到那里，敌人马上就知道，跟着追上来。就这样天天跟敌人兜圈子，紧张得日里吃不上饭，夜里不能睡觉。
    怎样对付敌人呢？大家意见很不一致。有的人流露出了动摇情绪，主张把队伍解散，把枪埋在地下；有的人主张转移到活动地区，跳出敌人包围圈去；也有主张同敌人拼一拼的。各种各样的意见很多。就在这时候，方志敏同志决定召开弋阳、横峰两县的干部会议来解决。开会的地点，挑选了一个敌人不注意的地方。这地方叫方胜峰。方胜峰是横峰与弋阳交界地方的一个小山，山上有座冷冷清清的破庙，这地方很少有人去。
    趁夜里天黑，我们悄悄下山去。到了山下，天快朦胧亮了，我们一个个挨着敌人的岗位旁边溜过去，敌人正在换岗哨，却没发觉。他们满以为我们还被包围在山顶上，那知道我们太平无事的到了方胜峰。
    大家到了方胜峰，都感到万分疲倦，因为搞了一个通宵，没有休息，身子一倒下去，便都睡着了。一直睡到中午才起来开会。记得参加这次会议的，有方志敏、我、黄道、邹秀峰、吴先民、方志纯等二十多位同志。其中有一位是湖北黄安（今红安县）来的同志，名字记不起来了，就叫他黄安同志吧。
    方志敏同志担任会议的主席，会上，争论很厉害。黄安同志主张埋枪、解散，他的理由是：各省发动了二百多处暴动，到现在先后都失败了。因为他从黄安来，所以把黄安暴动的失败的经验也带来了。
    方志敏同志坚决反对这种逃跑的办法。他说：“这里的群众跟我们一起革命，如果我们在困难的时候，便埋枪逃跑，群众牺牲太大；丢下群众逃跑，不是共产党员应有的态度，共产党员应当与群众共患难共生死，……谁要是不承认自己是共产党员，他可以走！我们不走，我们是要和群众一起坚决斗争下去的。”
    大家听了方志敏同志这番话，都一致赞成。会议又讨论到第二个意见：主张带了枪走，离开敌人包围圈，将敌人引到根据地以外去，然后我们再回来。讨论很快就得出结论，一致认为在根据地里，我们有群众可以依靠，如果转移到新地区去，人地两生疏，岂不自取灭亡？再说，就算把敌人引出了根据地，我们回来，敌人不还是跟了回来，引来引去，一点也解决不了问题。
    最后，讨论出只有坚持斗争。方志敏同志详细地分析了情况，他说：“我们还没跟敌人正式交过手，而现在敌人兵力很分散，群众又不支持他们，真的打起来，不见得就打不过他们。至于敌人消息灵通，紧紧跟住我们转，那是因为根据地内还有反动派存在，我们想走也走不了，只有打。再说在万不得已时，要转移阵地，那也得事前有些布置，在新地区先做好群众工作。万一仗打不赢，可以按照布置好的步骤转移。……”
    听了方志敏同志的具体分析，主张坚持斗争的空气浓厚起来了。同志们充满了新的信心，一致作打的准备。接着，我们就着手来研究敌情：当时包围我们的是敌人一个主力团和地方部队靖卫团，凡是向我中心地区和工作巩固基础好的地区进剿的，都是敌主力部队；我工作较为薄弱的地方，则由地方靖卫团进剿。根据这情况，我们选定了弋阳这一路的靖卫团，因为这路最为群众痛恨，群众曾要求我们打它，打它可以把广大群众争取过来。
    打击的目标确定了，接着又研究分工。当时，我们总共有了四十六条步枪，分了六条给方志敏同志，他负责去镇压反动派的气焰。其余四十条枪，交由我带去打敌人。
    当晚，部队下山来，天还下着雨，淋着雨走到天亮。我先到金鸡山，等着部队，却不见部队开来。原来这时部队里还没有传达方胜峰会议精神，士气很不好；同时，战士们看见这山上是光秃秃的，没有掩蔽的地方，都停在山脚下，不敢上来。待我知道后，就跑去动员，将会议上的决定跟大家一说，战士们的情绪顿时振奋起来。但我的话还没有讲完，消息传来，敌人来了！
    我们隐蔽在竹林子里，从高处望下去，十多里地一片火光。敌人从过港埠出来的一个连，驱逼着根据地内外一万多反水农民，一路烧杀而来。群众扶老携幼，满山遍野的乱逃。眼看着敌人从我们面前追过去，我们这支队伍，就绕到敌人背后，出其不意地杀了出去。一下子，就将靖卫团一个连冲垮，上万的反水农民，更乱了营。敌人拨回身子朝来路奔逃。后面人手中的梭标，戳到前面人的屁股上，前面的人就杀猪似的喊叫起来：“红军同志，我是被抓来的！”
    一瞬间，被敌人追赶的群众，也都回过身来，替我们助战。四周山头上，插满了红旗，一片喊杀声，弄得敌人摸不清红军究竟有多少人。
    敌人朝来路溃退，我们乘胜追击，一气追了五十里才停止。
    这一仗，震动了整个弋阳城，都以为红军要去攻城。城内乱成一团，伪县长怕死，闻风就出南门逃了。城里许多人挤着要过浮桥，人太多，有的就被挤落在河里淹死。可惜我们当时不知道城内情况，只是在城外向着城内打了几排枪就走了。
    继金鸡山战斗后，我们又接连在樟树墩和胡家墩打了两次伏击战，都取得了胜利。
    坚持斗争的方针胜利了，我们这支红军也在不断的斗争中，发展与壮大起来，并改编为“中国工农红军江西独立第五团”。
