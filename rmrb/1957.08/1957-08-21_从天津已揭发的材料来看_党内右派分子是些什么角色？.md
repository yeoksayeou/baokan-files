From Materials Revealed in Tianjin:
What Kind of Roles Do Right-Wing Elements Within the Party Play?
By Our Reporter Zhong Lin

What kind of roles do right-wing elements within the Party play? Why do they attack the Party while bearing the banner of "Communist Party member"? Some materials already revealed in Tianjin's anti-rightist struggle can provide some answers to this question. The right-wing elements within the Party discovered in Tianjin can be roughly divided into the following categories:

One category consists of alien class elements who harbor class hatred for the Party and the working class. They infiltrated the Party to find opportunities to attack the Party from within. For example, Su Xilin, an office secretary of the Tianjin Municipal Higher People's Court, had been dissatisfied with the Party ever since he joined because his counter-revolutionary uncle was sentenced to death. After the rectification campaign began this time, he colluded with bourgeois rightists in society, shouting that "the mistakes of the anti-rebellion movement are the main ones." He distorted the work of the Party organization in the anti-rebellion movement and slandered the court's Party group as a "sectarian group," inciting right-wing elements and "the masses" to attack the court's Party group. Obviously, they thought it was time for them to take revenge.

Another category consists of speculative elements who infiltrated the Party. For example, Han Kecai, a cadre of the Organization Department of the CPC Tianjin Tanggu District Committee, held the view that "Heaven punishes those who do not act for themselves." He also said, "The relationship between people is mutual exploitation." During the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, seeing that others were glorious as volunteers, he also signed up, but when the organization approved it, he was afraid of hardship and dared not go. This time, when he saw the bourgeois rightists attacking the Party with great momentum, he thought the Communist Party was probably failing, and he also sang the fallacies of "Party world," "various parties taking turns in power through elections, and the Communist Party stepping down does not mean Chiang Kai-shek's return," and so on. After the anti-rightist struggle began, he said again, "Left, middle, and right are all the same thing. The way of walking is different, but the purpose is the same." He also said that if he was expelled from the Party, he would become a "modern Qu Yuan." He shamelessly compared himself to "Qu Yuan" and slandered the Party and the people as "King of Chu."

Another category consists of degenerated elements who are complacent, make trouble over positions and treatments, and become degenerate when their personal desires are not satisfied. For example, Zhang Zhiying, a "transfer cadre" student and "Communist Party member" at Tianjin Medical College, used to see other jobs as better than her own and repeatedly requested transfers to achieve promotion. After entering medical college, she hated political activities and did not approach the masses. The Party organization repeatedly educated her, but she resented the Party organization. This time, when a right-wing clique of students held a mobilization meeting that Communist Party members were not allowed to attend, launching an attack on the Party, she ran to ask to participate in this meeting to "fire" at the Party. After obtaining the permission of the right-wing elements, she slandered the Party as "suppressing democracy" at the meeting and attacked Party leading cadres. As a result, based on this "confession" of this "Communist Party member," the right-wing elements passed resolutions such as demanding the re-election of the Party branch committee, expelling six or seven Party members, and establishing a rectification committee. Later, she and the right-wing elements quarreled in the mass meeting held by the Party branch, saying that the Party was persecuting her. After the anti-rightist struggle began, she also offered suggestions to the right-wing elements to deal with the struggle.

Another category consists of people who have had stains in their history or have made mistakes, have been punished, but have not been educated and have always resented the Party and hated the Party. For example, Sang Jian, a "transfer cadre" student and "Communist Party member" at Nankai University, had seriously leaked military secrets when he worked in the army and was criticized. He was also punished by Party discipline for concealing his father's rebellious acts. As a result, Sang Jian shouted that he wanted to leave the Party's position and stand on the position of a third party. As a result, he stood on the position of the bourgeois right-wing and followed behind Tan Tianrong, the leader of the reactionary clique "Baihua Xueshe" at Peking University, carrying out anti-Party and anti-socialist activities at Nankai University. Another example is Zhang Fuchun, the chief of the Secretariat Section and deputy secretary of the Party branch of the Hexi District Public Security Bureau. During the Japanese occupation, he had sent information to the sentry box, and this matter was investigated in the anti-rebellion movement. When he requested a promotion during the evaluation, he did not achieve his goal and was very dissatisfied with the Party. When the bourgeois right-wing attacked the Party, he also said that "the mistakes of the anti-rebellion movement are the main ones." He also said, "The Kuomintang has direct and non-direct lines, and the Communist Party also has them." He also slandered the leading personnel's participation in physical labor as "Liu Bei throwing his child, buying people's hearts."

There are also some people who joined the Party organizationally but are full of bourgeois ideas in their minds. When the bourgeois right-wing launched a large-scale attack on the Party, they also took the opportunity to rise up and transform the Party and society according to the bourgeois system. For example, Xiao Di, deputy editor-in-chief of Tianjin Youth Daily, and Ma Xianduo, head of the Political and Legal Group, these two "Communist Party members" wanted to transform the newspaper according to the bourgeois journalistic viewpoint. They both opposed the Party's leadership of the newspaper. Xiao Di said: "The Party itself is unable to overcome the 'three evils.' The official newspaper can only condone the 'three evils.' To eliminate the 'three evils,' it is necessary to run a newspaper with 'independent authority.'" Gao Hongfei, deputy director of the Political Economy Teaching and Research Office of Tianjin Intermediate Party School and "Communist Party member," said that the Party committee was an "amateur" and could not lead education, and that his anti-Party clique should lead it. Wang Wei, a "Communist Party member" in the song and dance troupe of the Tianjin People's Art Theater, offered suggestions to the right-wing clique to attack the Party. He agreed that the right-wing elements should form an "art committee" to lead the song and dance troupe.

In order to maintain the Party's ideological and political purity, the vast majority of Communist Party members in Tianjin, together with the broad masses, are seriously struggling with the small number of right-wing elements within the Party, just like struggling with other right-wing elements.

    从天津已揭发的材料来看
　　党内右派分子是些什么角色？
　　本报记者　锺林
    党内的右派分子是些什么角色呢？他们为什么挂着“共产党员”的招牌来进攻党呢？天津市反右派斗争中已经揭露出来的一些材料，可以对这个问题找到一些答案。天津已发现的党内右派分子，大致可以分为以下几类来谈：
    一类是对党和工人阶级抱有阶级仇恨的异己分子，他们混进党内，就是为了要找机会从内部来进攻党的。例如天津市高级法院办公室秘书苏习林入党以后，对党一直不满，这因为他的反革命的叔父被判处了死刑。这次整风开始以后，他就跟社会上的资产阶级右派里应外合，大叫“肃反运动的错误是主要的”。他把党组织在肃反运动中的工作加以歪曲，并且诬蔑法院党组是“宗派主义集团”，煽动右派分子和“群众”去进攻法院党组。很显然，他们以为这是他们报仇的时候了。
    一类是混入党内的投机分子。例如中共天津市塘沽区委组织部干事韩克才，他的论调就是“人不为己，天诛地灭”。还说：“人与人的关系就是互相利用”。抗美援朝时看见别人当了志愿军很光荣，他也报名参军，组织上批准了，他又害怕艰苦不敢去了。这回他看见资产阶级右派向党进攻的时候气势汹汹，他以为共产党大概不行了，也跟着高唱“党天下”、“各党派通过竞选轮流执政，共产党下台不等于蒋介石回来”等等谬论。反右派斗争开展起来以后，他又说“左、中、右都是一码事，路的走法不同，但都是一个目的”。他还说，如果开除他的党籍，他就要作一个“现代的屈原”。他竟毫不知耻地把自己比做“屈原”，把党和人民污蔑为“楚王”。
    一类是居功自傲，闹地位闹待遇，个人欲望得不到满足就堕落变质的蜕化分子。例如天津医学院的“调干”学生、“共产党员”张志英，从前在工作岗位上就这山看见那山高，屡次要求调动以达到升迁的目的。她入医学院学习后，厌恶政治活动，不接近群众，党组织屡次教育她，她却怀恨党组织。这一次，当学生中的右派小集团召开不要共产党员参加的、发动向党进攻的誓师大会时，她跑去要求参加这个会对党“开炮”，得到右派分子的允许后，她就在这个会上诬蔑党“压制民主”，并攻击党员领导干部。结果，右派分子们就根据她这个“共产党员”的“自白”，通过要求改选党支委会、开除六、七名党员和成立整风委员会等决议。以后她又跟右派分子一起在党支部召开的群众会上大吵大闹，她说党迫害她。反右派斗争开展起来以后她又替右派分子出谋划策，应付斗争。
    一类是历史上有过污点或犯过错误，受过处分，但没有被教育过来，一直怀恨党仇视党的人。例如南开大学的“调干”学生、“共产党员”桑健，他从前在部队工作时，曾有严重的泄漏军事机密的行为，受到批评。又因为隐瞒他父亲的叛变革命的行为，受到党纪处分。桑健因此叫喊说他要离开党的立场，站到第三者的立场上。结果，他就站在资产阶级右派的立场上，跟在北京大学的反动小集团“百花学社”首领谭天荣的屁股后面，在南开大学进行反党反社会主义的活动。又如河西区公安分局秘书科科长、党总支副书记张福春，他在日寇占领时期，曾给岗楼上送过情报，肃反运动中追查了他这件事；在评级的时候他要求升级又没有达到目的，就对党很不满意。资产阶级右派向党进攻的时候，他也说“肃反运动的错误是主要的”。还说“国民党有嫡系非嫡系之分，共产党也有。”他还诬蔑领导人员参加体力劳动是“刘备摔孩子，收买人心”。
    还有一些人是在组织上入了党，脑袋里装满了资产阶级思想；在资产阶级右派大举进攻党的时候，他们也乘机而起，要按照资产阶级的一套来改造党和改造社会。例如天津青年报副总编辑萧荻和政法组组长马贤铎，这两个“共产党员”，就是要按照资产阶级的新闻学观点来改造报纸的。他们都反对党对报纸的领导。萧荻说：“党本身无力克服‘三害’，机关报只能纵容‘三害’，要除‘三害’，只有办一个有‘独立权限’的报纸。”天津中级党校政治经济学教研室副主任、“共产党员”高虹飞，说党委是“外行”，不能领导教育，应该由他的反党小集团去领导。天津人民艺术剧院歌舞团里的“共产党员”王巍，替右派小集团出谋划策向党进攻，他同意由右派分子们组成“艺术委员会”来领导歌舞团。
    为了保持党在思想上、政治上的纯洁，天津的绝对大多数的共产党员们，和广大群众在一起，像斗争其他右派分子一样，也在严肃地同党内为数极少的右派分子进行斗争。
