Compile Next Year's Plan in Accordance with the Spirit of Diligence and Thrift
Zhengzhou Railway Bureau Corrects the Tendency of Dispersed Investment

    This Dispatch: Our correspondent Lai Weiliang reports: The Zhengzhou Railway Bureau resolutely implements the policy of building the country with diligence and thrift. In the process of compiling the draft basic construction plan for 1958, it criticized and corrected the phenomena of dispersed investment, excessive non-productive construction, and overly high standards, determined the focus of investment for the entire year, and stipulated the proportion of non-productive construction.

    In order to issue the basic construction plan for the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan in a timely manner at the end of this year, the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau organized various railway sub-bureaus and on-site units around July to study and propose a draft basic construction plan for next year. Because the investment direction and priorities were not clear to each unit, a large number of dispersed and piecemeal investment projects appeared in the draft plan. Some units blindly demanded a comprehensive technical transformation, and some units proposed an excessive proportion of non-productive construction. Many units lacked systematic investigation and research on how to improve the railway transport capacity to adapt to the development of industrial and agricultural production, and their understanding of gradually adopting new technologies was also unclear. For example, the locomotive department requested a comprehensive technical transformation in five locomotive depots; various railway sub-bureaus requested the construction of walls around most stations, rubble freight yards, and toilets. The expenses required by various units to build employee housing, employee cafeterias, bathhouses, and supplier stores actually accounted for the main part of the bureau's investment.

    After analyzing the above situation, the leaders of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau believed that this was mainly caused by poor ideological leadership and unclear investment direction. They repeatedly explained to the cadres that next year's basic construction investment should still adhere to the principle of focusing on key investments, and should be planned and used properly in a coordinated manner. After criticizing the departmentalism and unrealistic ideas of pursuing large-scale and comprehensive projects among the cadres, and announcing the abolition of the hundreds of proposed plan proposals, the bureau's leadership proposed the scope of investment use for next year, with the main part used to improve railway transport capacity. They believed that in addition to continuing the double-tracking projects of the Longhai and Beijing-Hankou railways and the three large railway hub station projects in Xi'an, Zhengzhou, and Wuhan, which are above the quota, according to the transport development situation after the opening of the Yangtze River Bridge and the partial opening of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway and the Beijing-Hankou Railway double track, attention should be paid to improving the throughput capacity of the Tongguan to Baoji section of the Longhai Railway and the northern section of the Yuehan Railway, adding passing loops, and extending station tracks to increase locomotive traction tonnage. At the same time, it is also necessary to focus on improving the water supply capacity of the southern section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway to meet the needs of busy transportation. As for non-productive construction, according to central regulations, no more auditoriums, guesthouses, or office buildings will be built; non-productive buildings such as employee housing that need to be built should also adopt simple houses or low-standard designs.

    After clarifying the investment focus and investment direction, the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau is currently organizing several working groups to conduct further detailed investigation and research along the line, so as to submit the design task book early according to the basic construction procedures and start the design of key projects in late September.

    Recently, Teng Daiyuan, Minister of Railways, learned about the process of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau compiling the draft basic construction plan for 1958, and believed that the bureau's working methods and the spirit it grasped were correct and worthy of emulation by other relevant units.

### 按照勤俭精神编制明年计划　郑州铁路局纠正分散投资的倾向

　　按照勤俭精神编制明年计划
　　郑州铁路局纠正分散投资的倾向
    本报讯　本报通讯员来维良报道：郑州铁路管理局坚决执行勤俭建国的方针，在编制1958年基本建设计划建议案的过程中，批判和纠正了分散投资、非生产性建设过多和标准过高的现象，确定了全年的投资重点，规定了非生产性建筑的比例。
    为了及时在今年年底下达第二个五年计划头一年的基本建设计划，郑州铁路管理局在7月前后，曾经组织各个铁路分局和现场单位，研究提出了明年的基本建设计划建议案。由于各单位对投资方向和重点不十分明确，建议案中出现了大量分散和零星的投资项目，有的单位盲目要求全面进行技术改造，有的单位提出的非生产性建筑比重过大。许多单位对如何提高铁路运输通过能力，以适应工农业生产发展的问题，缺乏系统的调查研究，对逐步采用新技术的认识也不明确。例如，机务部门要求在五个机务段进行全面技术改造；各铁路分局要求给大部分车站修围墙，修片石货场，修厕所。各单位要求修建职工住宅、职工食堂、浴池、供应商店的费用，竟占了全局投资的主要部分。
    在分析了上述情况以后，郑州铁路管理局领导人员认为，这主要是思想领导差、投资方向不明确所造成的。他们便反复向干部们说明，明年基本建设投资仍然应该坚持重点投资的原则，并且要统筹安排，使用得当。在批判了干部中的本位主义和求大求全的脱离实际的思想，并且宣布废除这次提出的数百件计划建议案以后，这个局的领导方面提出了明年的投资使用范围，主要部分用于提高铁路运输通过能力。他们认为，除了要继续进行限额以上的陇海、京汉铁路的复线工程以及西安、郑州、武汉等三个大型铁路枢纽站工程以外，根据长江大桥通车、宝成铁路和京汉铁路复线部分通车后的运输发展情况和原有设备能力，应该注意提高陇海铁路潼关到宝鸡段和粤汉铁路北段的通过能力，增设会让站，延长站线，以提高机车牵引定数。同时还要着重提高京汉铁路南段的给水能力，适应运输繁忙的需要。至于非生产性建设，按中央规定不再修建礼堂、招待所，办公楼；对有必要修建的职工住宅等非生产性建筑，也要采用简易房屋或低标准设计。
    在明确了投资重点和投资方向以后，郑州铁路管理局目前正组织几个工作组深入沿线，进一步做具体调查研究，以便按基本建设程序提早交出设计任务书，在9月下旬开始重点工程的设计。
    铁道部部长滕代远最近了解了郑州铁路管理局编制1958年基本建设计划建议案的过程，认为这个局的工作方法和掌握的精神是正确的，值得其他有关单位仿效。
