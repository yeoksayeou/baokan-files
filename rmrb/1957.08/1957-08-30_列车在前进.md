　　The Train Moves On
　　Lǐ Gēng
　　To the Deep Mountains
    The train speeds towards the vast mountains and fields...
    During the long journey, I, a lone traveler, was assailed by an unbearable loneliness. Only the vibrant scenes of the mountains and fields flashing past the window brought an infinite freshness to my emotions.
    Who cast such a deep gaze upon me? Ah! The young woman sitting across from me, her eyes seemed to be exploring me: "Lonely? Why not talk?"
    And so, I used a low voice to knock down the wall of unfamiliarity between us.
    "Going to the seaside?"
    "No! Going to the deep mountains!" She pointed to the end of the clouds.
    "Ah! Haven't you considered the hardships?"
    "The needs of the motherland enable people to overcome these!"
    After that, we talked about many things: her university life, her mother, and her fiancé working in the city...
    Soon, she arrived at her station, a remote mountain station.
    It was drizzling outside the window. We said "goodbye" to each other, and I saw her carrying a heavy package and a satchel resembling a medical kit, stepping onto the platform. Her two small braids fluttered in the mountain wind.
    The train moved on.
    Her figure gradually blurred before my eyes, but her voice and image became clearer and clearer in my heart, like a statue standing in my emotions.
    Sing a Song Facing the Morning Breeze
    The gentle wind gently lifted the green curtain hanging from the train window. The morning sun caressed the rosy cheeks, black hair, and affectionate eyes of a group of young men and women with its warmest light. It listened to the singing, listening to the heroic songs of these young people.
        Oh, the earth! How fertile,
        Oh, the motherland! How vast;
        I want to become a swallow,
        I want to become a cloud.
          Flying to the borderlands of the motherland,
        To be the master of the earth;
        With our own diligent hands,
        We will awaken the sleeping land.
    What a loud song! Shaking the bouncing carriage, shaking every excited heart. The wind blowing in through the window sent this song, over and over again, into the distance...
    When their throats were dry, and when they scooped up bowls of boiling water with porcelain bowls, I noticed the dazzling crimson characters on the porcelain bowls: "To those who support border construction."

　　列车在前进
　　李耕
　  到深山中去
    列车，向辽阔的山野飞驰。……
    在长长的旅途中，我这个单身旅客被一种难耐的寂寞侵袭着，只有窗外跳动着的山野盛景，给我的感情送来了无限的清新。
    是谁给我投来了深沉的目光呢！啊！对座的少女，你的眼光这时似乎在向我探索着：“寂寞吗！为什么不谈谈呢？”
    于是，我用低沉的声音，叩开了我们之间一重陌生的墙壁。
    “到海滨去吗？”
    “不！到深山中去！”她用手指着那云天的尽头。
    “啊！你没有考虑到艰苦？”
    “祖国的需要是能使人克服这些的！”
    随着，我们谈了很多：她的大学生活，她的母亲，还有那在城市工作的未婚夫……
    不久，她到站了，一个偏僻的山区小站。
    这时窗外正下着蒙蒙细雨，我们互道了一声“再见”，便见她背着一件沉重的包袱和一只类似诊疗箱的挎包，一步一步向站台跨去。两支小辫子在山风里抖抖地飘摇着。
    列车移动了。
    她的背影渐渐地在我的眼前模糊了起来，可是她的声音和影子，却在我的心灵中一时比一时明朗，像一樽塑像在我的感情里矗立着。
    迎着晨风，唱只歌
    轻轻的风，轻轻地揭开列车窗口垂下的绿帘，朝阳，用最温煦的光抚摸着一群少男少女红润的面颊、乌黑的头发、多情的眼睛。它在听着歌唱，听着这群年青人的豪迈的歌声。
        大地啊！多么肥沃，
        祖国啊！多么辽阔；
        我要变成燕子，
        我要变成云朵。
          飞向祖国的边地，
        做个大地的主人；
        用自己勤劳的手，
        将沉睡的土地唤醒。
    多么宏亮的歌声啊！震荡着跳动的车箱，摇撼着每个激动的心。那窗口飘进来的风，又将这一遍又一遍的歌声送向远处。……
    当他们的歌喉干涩了，当他们用瓷碗舀起了一碗碗开水，我才发现瓷碗上那一排耀眼的朱红色的字：“送给支援边境建设的人”。
