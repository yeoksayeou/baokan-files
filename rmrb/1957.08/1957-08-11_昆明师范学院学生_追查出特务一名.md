Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 7th - Peng Guili, a backbone element of a rightist clique at Kunming Normal College, has been found to be a Central Bureau of Investigation and Statistics (CC Investigation Statistics) secret agent who had been hiding for eight years.

Peng Guili was a second-year student in the History Specialization program at Kunming Normal College. During the period of great contending and blooming, Peng Guili posted inflammatory big-character posters, cursing the leadership as an "oligarchy," saying that "entering the teachers' college is like being in confinement," and slandering members of the Communist Youth League as "madmen." He also coerced other students to sign the big-character posters. This small clique suppressed and cursed students who offered positive suggestions.

As the struggle deepened, Peng Guili, under the masses' layer-by-layer exposure and persistent reasoning, revealed his true colors. It turned out that Peng Guili was a secret agent of the Central Bureau of Investigation and Statistics of the Kuomintang's Sichuan Province Fushun County Student Movement Group. Before liberation, he monitored and persecuted many progressive teachers and students in schools in Fushun, sabotaging the student movement. In the early days of liberation, the secret agent leader who directed him even instructed him to try to infiltrate the Communist Party and wait for an opportunity to rise again. He refused to confess for a long time and infiltrated Kunming Normal College in 1955. When the great contending and blooming began, he became rampant and finally revealed his true colors.

    昆明师范学院学生
    追查出特务一名
    新华社昆明7日电　昆明师范学院一个右派小集团的骨干分子彭贵礼，据查明原来是一个隐藏八年之久的中统特务。
    彭贵礼是昆明师范学院历史专修科二年级学生。在大鸣大放中，彭贵礼贴出了煽动性的大字报，咒骂领导是“寡头政治”，说“进师院像坐禁闭”，诬蔑团员是“疯子”。他还要挟其他学生在大字报上签名。这个小集团对提正面意见的学生进行压制和咒骂。
    随着斗争的深入，彭贵礼在群众层层剥皮、坚持说理斗争的回击下，暴露出自己的本来面目。原来彭贵礼是国民党中统局四川省富顺县学运小组的特务，解放前在富顺的学校中监视和迫害过许多进步教师和学生，破坏学生运动。解放初期，领导他的特务头子还曾指示他设法打入共产党，伺机再起。他长期拒不坦白，1955年混入昆明师范学院，大鸣大放开始，就猖獗活动起来，终于露出了原形。什么画
