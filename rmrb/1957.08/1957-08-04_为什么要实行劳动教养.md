The State Council's "Decision on Labor Re-education Issues" has been approved and promulgated by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. This decision is an important measure to settle and reform various bad elements, maintain national laws and disciplines, and further consolidate the socialist order.

In our country, the socialist cause is flourishing, the labor enthusiasm of the people is unprecedentedly high, the new socialist moral customs have been highly developed, and social order has seen an unprecedentedly stable situation. This proves the great superiority of the socialist system. However, we have not yet reformed all the bad people, and we have not had time to completely eliminate the toxins left over from the old society. Domestically, in addition to those remaining counter-revolutionaries and other criminals who should be sentenced according to law, and whose number is much smaller than in the past, there are still some bad people. They are idle, and engage in hooliganism, theft, fraud and other violations of public security administration, and repeatedly refuse to mend their ways despite repeated education. They are the dregs of society. They are steeped in the exploiting classes' bad habits of living without labor, committing crimes, disrupting social order, harassing women, defrauding money and property, and infringing on the interests of the people. Some of them are counter-revolutionaries and anti-socialist reactionaries with minor crimes who may not be held criminally responsible. Some are bad elements with labor ability but have long refused to work or violated discipline, disturbed public order, and have been expelled. There are also bad elements who do not obey the state's work assignment, do not obey employment and transfer arrangements, do not accept persuasion to engage in labor production, and constantly make unreasonable demands and obstruct official duties, and repeatedly refuse to mend their ways despite repeated education. For the above-mentioned categories of bad elements, it is necessary to implement labor re-education in order to reform them, maintain national laws and disciplines, and consolidate the socialist order. This is an obvious truth.

However, right-wingers, in order to undermine the socialist legal system, have strongly opposed our government's crackdown on these bad elements. Right-winger Tan Tiwu once cited the case of Wang Yufeng, a bad element in the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, at a forum of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, to attack our judicial work. In fact, Wang Yufeng was a puppet government employee before liberation. After liberation, he was retained to work in the Fushun Mining Bureau. In 1951, he was transferred to the Beijing Petroleum Bureau. In 1952, he was rated as a second-level technician, and in 1953, he was promoted to a first-level technician. He originally did not understand technology but received very high treatment, and should have worked hard, but he was passive and lazy, saying that the government was making too little use of his talents. In August 1956, he simply stopped going to work and took his wife and children to cities such as Kunming, Chengdu, Chongqing, and Hankou, where he swaggered and deceived, scammed food and lodging, and cursed the Communist Party and the People's Government. The Ministry of Petroleum Industry had no choice but to announce his dismissal for such bad quality. After Wang Yufeng ran into walls everywhere, he returned to Beijing and made unreasonable demands on the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, pestering them for several months. On the evening of February 15 this year, at more than 9 o'clock, he broke into the courtyard of the dormitory of Li Juikui, the Minister of Petroleum Industry, and cursed by name, smashed things, and attempted to hit people, making a scene until more than 1 o'clock in the middle of the night. After all kinds of persuasion were ineffective, the Dongdan Public Security Bureau of Beijing had no choice but to detain him. Ask Tan Tiwu: Should the socialist legal system protect bad people like Wang Yufeng? Should the People's Government not restrain and punish such bad people, but should it allow him to arbitrarily make trouble and destroy?

We must never think that the hooligans, loafers, thieves, fraudsters, counter-revolutionaries, anti-socialist reactionaries and other various bad elements mentioned above only exist in society. In fact, they also exist within our agencies, organizations, enterprises, and schools; they not only exist in cities, but also in rural areas. These are negative factors left over from the old society, and we cannot reform these people in a short period of time. Although these people are a very small number, the destructive effect they bring to the country and the people is worth serious attention.

If the People's Government ignores these people who do not work and are destructive everywhere, and does not take appropriate measures, this bad tendency will continue to spread and develop, the number of these bad elements may increase, social order will be impossible to maintain, the socialist moral customs will be corrupted by them, and our socialist construction cause will be seriously affected. Moreover, they often become the objects of utilization by counter-revolutionaries.

Facts have proved that it is generally ineffective to use persuasive education methods for these bad elements; simple punishment methods are also not effective; it is also impossible to continue to employ them within agencies, organizations, and enterprises; and no one is willing to take them in for other employment. Therefore, for these people, there is a need for a proper method that can both reform them and guarantee their livelihood. According to the People's Government's long-term research and consideration, taking them in and implementing labor re-education is the most appropriate and best method.

In simple terms, this method means that the state takes in those bad elements, arranges them, and provides them with appropriate labor conditions, such as the state investing in the establishment of some farms and factories, organizing them to produce, and even forcing them to produce, in order to provide them with food. In this way, labor re-education is both to support themselves through their own labor, and to reform themselves through labor. This reflects the concern and responsibility of our socialist country for these people's lives, labor, and future. The state's handling and arrangement of them is precisely to ensure that the free and happy lives of the vast majority of working people and the socialist order are not disrupted.

The method of labor re-education embodies the socialist principle of "he who does not work, neither shall he eat". In a socialist country, labor is a glorious thing for all citizens with the ability to work. At the same time, abiding by labor discipline, abiding by public order, and respecting social morality are the obligations of every citizen, and these have been written into our country's constitution. People like this who have the ability to work but do not work, who disrupt discipline and order, and who corrupt social morality, have violated both socialist principles and our country's constitution. This is not allowed by the people.

However, it should be pointed out that labor re-education is different from the labor reform of criminals, and it is also different from the nursing homes that provide relief to widows, widowers, orphans, and the childless elderly. The administrative organs of labor re-education must formulate a set of mandatory administrative systems and disciplines, and those undergoing labor re-education must not be allowed to violate these systems and disciplines. For example, they are not allowed to leave farms and factories freely, they are not allowed to disrupt public order, and they are not allowed to disrupt production, otherwise they will be punished, and those with serious circumstances will also be subject to legal sanctions. However, in labor production, the principle of paying wages based on labor results is also implemented for them, specifically, more work, more pay; less work, less pay; no work, no pay. They have the right to freely dispose of their wages, except for a portion that needs to be deducted as alimony for their families and a reserve fund for their own resettlement. The state provides these conditions and implements this method, which enables us to transform bad people into good people and to transform negative factors into positive factors.

People who need labor re-education are limited to those listed in the decision. The decision stipulates the specific conditions for people who should be subject to labor re-education and the limits of authority for review and approval, which ensures the correct implementation of this method and avoids possible deviations in the work. At the same time, during the period of labor re-education, those who perform well, have conditions for other employment, or whose original sending units, parents, or guardians request to take them back and be responsible for their own discipline, the labor re-education organs may approve as appropriate. These regulations not only demonstrate the government's determination to deal with bad people, maintain national discipline, and maintain normal social order, but also fully embody the socialist country's lenient policy of reforming bad people and its spirit of utmost benevolence.

The decision on labor re-education, approved by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, has legislative nature. This is another initiative in our country's socialist transformation and legal construction, and a concrete measure to implement Article 100 of the Constitution. Right-wingers attack our implementation of labor re-education as violating the Constitution. This is the most blatant malicious attack. The labor re-education method has important significance and long-term goals for transforming society. It is not only applicable to the present, but also to the entire transition period. Even after the successful construction of socialist society, if there are still such bad people, the method of labor re-education will still have its practical significance. Because bad people can only be thoroughly reformed through labor. No matter what rumors and slanders the imperialists and the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique make about this, it is not worth our attention, because the things they attack and slander us are often the things we do very well and very correctly. It is hoped that party committees and governments at all levels will conscientiously implement the State Council's "Decision on Labor Re-education Issues," constantly create experience in practice, improve their work, and achieve the expected results in this work.

    为什么要实行劳动教养
    国务院“关于劳动教养问题的决定”已经全国人民代表大会常务委员会批准公布。这个决定是安置和改造各种坏分子，维护国家法纪，进一步巩固社会主义秩序的一项重要措施。
    在我们的国家里，社会主义事业正在蓬勃地发展，人民群众的劳动热情空前高涨，社会主义新的道德风尚，得到了高度的发扬，社会秩序出现了历史上从来没有过的安定局面。这证明了社会主义制度的极大优越性。但是，我们还没有把所有的坏人都改造好，没有来得及把旧社会遗留下来的污毒都扫除尽净。在国内，除了那些残留的、数量已经比过去少得多的应该依法判刑的反革命分子和其他犯罪分子以外，还有一些坏人。他们不务正业，有流氓、盗窃、诈骗等违反治安管理的行为，并且屡教不改。他们是社会的渣滓，他们浸透了剥削阶级不劳而食的恶习，为非作歹，破坏社会秩序，调戏妇女，诈骗钱财，侵犯人民利益。他们有些是有轻微罪行、可不追究刑事责任的反革命分子和反社会主义的反动分子。他们也有些是具有劳动能力，但又长期拒绝劳动或者破坏纪律、妨害公共秩序，受到开除处分的坏分子。还有一种是不服从国家的工作分配，不服从就业转业的安置，不接受从事劳动生产的劝导，而又不断无理取闹，妨害公务，屡教不改的坏分子。对于上述几类坏分子，必须实行劳动教养，才有可能予以改造，才能维护国家的法纪，才能巩固社会主义的秩序。这是显而易见的道理。
    但是，右派分子为了破坏社会主义的法制，却极力反对我们的政府对于这些坏分子的取缔。右派分子谭惕吾曾经在民革中央座谈会上举了石油工业部的坏分子王裕丰的事件，来攻击我们的司法工作。实际上，王裕丰在解放前是一个伪职员，解放后留用在抚顺矿务局工作，1951年调来北京石油总局，1952年评为二级技术员，1953年又提为一级技术员。他本来不懂技术而待遇很高，理应努力工作，但是他却消极怠工，说政府把他大材小用了。到了1956年8月，他就干脆不上班，带了老婆、孩子，跑遍昆明、成都、重庆、汉口等城市，到处招摇撞骗，骗吃强住，并且大骂共产党和人民政府。石油工业部对于这样品质恶劣的坏分子不得不宣布开除。王裕丰到处碰壁以后，又回到北京，同石油工业部无理取闹，纠缠了好几个月。今年2月15日晚上九点多钟，他竟闯进石油工业部部长李聚奎宿舍院内，指名骂人，砸东西，并企图打人，一直闹到半夜一点多钟，百般劝说无效，最后北京市东单公安分局不得不把他扣留起来。问问谭惕吾：难道社会主义法制要保护像王裕丰这样的坏人，人民政府对这样的坏人就不应该加以约束和惩处，而应该让他任意捣乱任意破坏下去么？
    我们决不要以为前面所说的那些流氓、阿飞、盗窃、诈骗分子、反革命分子、反社会主义的反动分子及其他各种坏分子，仅仅在社会上有，其实在我们的机关、团体和企业、学校内部也有；他们不仅在城市里有，在农村中同样也有。这是旧社会遗留下来的消极因素，我们还不可能在短期内把这些人改造好。这些人虽然是极少数，但是他们给国家和人民带来的破坏作用，却是值得严重注意的。
    对于这些不劳动，不工作，到处起破坏作用的人，人民政府如果放任不管，不加以适当的处理，这种恶劣倾向就会继续蔓延发展，这种坏分子还可能增多起来，社会秩序就会无法维持，社会主义的道德风尚就会被他们败坏，我们的社会主义建设事业就会受到严重的影响。而且他们又往往会变成反革命分子利用的对象。
    事实证明，对于这些坏分子，一般地用说服教育的办法是无效的；采取简单的惩罚办法也不行；在机关、团体、企业内部也决不能继续留用；让他们另行就业又没有人愿意收留他们。因此，对于这些人，就需要有一个既能改造他们，又能保障其生活出路的妥善办法。根据人民政府长期的研究和考虑，把他们收容起来，实行劳动教养，就是最适当的也是最好的办法。
    这个办法用通俗的语言来说，就是国家把那些坏分子收容起来，加以安排，给他们适当的劳动条件，例如由国家投资举办一些农场和工厂，组织他们生产，甚至强制他们生产，用这样一种办法来使他们有饭吃。这样说来，劳动教养既是通过他们自己的劳动来养活他们自己；同时也是通过劳动来改造他们自己。这正表现我们社会主义国家对于这些人的生活、劳动、前途的关怀和负责精神。国家对他们的处理和安排，也正是为了保障绝大多数劳动人民的自由幸福生活和社会主义秩序不受破坏。
    劳动教养的办法体现了不劳动不得食的社会主义原则。在社会主义国家里，劳动是一切有劳动能力的公民的光荣的事情。同时，遵守劳动纪律，遵守公共秩序，尊重社会公德，这是每个公民的义务，这都已写入我国的宪法。像这样一些有劳动能力而不劳动的人，破坏纪律秩序，败坏社会公德的人，他们是既破坏了社会主义原则，又违反了我国的宪法。这是人民所不允许的。　
    但是，应当指出：劳动教养同劳动改造罪犯是有区别的，它同救济鳏寡孤独的教养院也不相同。劳动教养的管理机关必须制定一套带有强制性的行政制度和纪律，不能允许被劳动教养的人破坏这些制度和纪律。例如不准他们随便离开农场和工厂而自由行动，不准破坏公共秩序，不准破坏生产，否则就要受到处分，情节严重的还要受到法律制裁。但是，在劳动生产中，对他们同样实行按劳动成果给工资报酬的原则，具体地说就是多劳多得，少劳少得，不劳不得。他们的工资，除了有的需要酌量扣出一部分作为其家属赡养费和本人安家立业的储备金以外，其余部分他们有自由处理的权利。国家提供了这样一些条件，实行了这种办法，就使我们能够把坏人改造成为好人，能够把消极因素转化为积极因素。
    需要劳动教养的人，只限于决定中所列举的那些人。决定中规定了应该受到劳动教养的人的具体条件和审查批准的权限，这样就保证了这项办法的正确执行，避免在工作中可能发生的偏差。同时，在劳动教养期间，凡是表现良好的，有条件另行就业的，或者原送请劳动教养的单位、家长、监护人请求领回自行负责管教的，劳动教养机关都可以酌情批准。这些规定，既表现了政府处置坏人、维护国家纪律、维护正常的社会秩序的决心，又充分体现了社会主义国家改造坏人的宽大政策和仁至义尽的精神。
    劳动教养的决定，经过全国人民代表大会常务委员会批准，就具有立法性质。这是我国社会主义改造和法制建设中的又一创举，是贯彻宪法第一百条的一个具体措施。右派分子攻击我们实行劳动教养违反宪法，这是最露骨的一种恶意攻击。劳动教养办法具有改造社会的重要意义和长远的目的，它不仅适用于目前，而且适用于整个过渡时期。就是在社会主义社会建设成功以后，如果还有这种坏人存在，劳动教养的办法仍然有它的实际意义。因为坏人只有通过劳动才能够彻底加以改造。不管帝国主义和台湾蒋介石集团对此进行什么造谣和污蔑，都是不值得我们去理睬的，因为他们攻击污蔑我们的事情，往往正是我们办得很对、办得很好的事情。希望各级党委和政府认真地贯彻国务院“关于劳动教养问题的决定”，在实践中不断地创造经验，改进工作，使这一项工作获得预期的成效。
