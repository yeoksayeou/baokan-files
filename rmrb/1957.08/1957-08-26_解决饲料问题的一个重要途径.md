    An Important Way to Solve the Feed Problem
　　Commentator of this Newspaper
    At the end of June, the number of pigs raised nationwide reached 111.1 million, an increase of 32% compared to the same period last year, and exceeding the level of 1954, the year with the most pigs raised in our country. To consolidate and develop this achievement, it is necessary to continue to strengthen leadership and provide effective support to the pig-raising industry in all aspects. At present, special attention needs to be paid to actively solving the feed problem. Pig feed should be given the same importance as the feed for other livestock, and overall planning should be carried out to solve it properly. In the past, the lack of feed was often particularly serious in the winter and spring seasons; this year, past lessons should be learned, and preparations and arrangements should be made as early as possible.

    Late summer, autumn, and early winter are the seasons when green grass is everywhere and crops are harvested. At this time, the masses should be actively mobilized, and closely combined with other agricultural activities (such as weeding, pest control, fertilizer accumulation, harvesting, etc.) to collect and store large quantities of green fodder and agricultural by-products that can be used to feed pigs, raise sheep, and feed draft animals, in preparation for the large needs of this winter and next spring.

    There are many green fodder and agricultural by-products available for livestock feed in various parts of our country, and wild plants that can feed pigs are everywhere in the mountains and fields. The stems, leaves, vines, and tendrils of most crops, as well as various leftover vegetables, are all good feed. Some provinces have already conducted surveys on this. According to a survey in Hebei Province, there are 285 kinds of wild green fodder suitable for feeding pigs, including: 24 kinds of vegetables, 41 kinds of tree leaves and seeds, 13 kinds of succulent plants, 31 kinds of aquatic plants, 135 kinds of wild weeds, and 41 kinds of agricultural by-products (leaves, shells). Experiments have proved that feeding pigs with these feeds can indeed increase their fat and weight; some wild feeds are very popular with pigs and also accelerate the fattening effect. The
  “purple clover” (grass seeds) planted in various parts of the south, according to preliminary chemical analysis, four catties of young leaves
  (which can be dried into one catty of dried vegetables) is equivalent to the nutritional content of one catty of wheat bran. Purple clover is used as fertilizer, and its fertilizing effect is mainly in the roots. Cutting off a portion of the stems and leaves to be used as feed will not reduce the fertilizing effect. Now some places use it all as green manure and have not made good use of it. According to calculations by relevant departments, about 58 million mu of purple clover are planted in the southern provinces of our country. If it can be fully utilized and 400 catties are cut from each mu, 23.2 billion catties of green fodder can be harvested, equivalent to 5.8 billion catties of wheat bran. It can be seen that the potential of green fodder in our country is very large. As the saying goes: "Pigs eat hundreds of kinds of grass, it depends on whether you can find them."

    Storing large quantities of green fodder is also of great significance in saving feed grain. According to typical surveys in various places, raising a pig from small to large requires about 2,500 to 3,000 catties of green fodder. If an average of about 1,300 catties of green fodder can be stored per pig (enough for the needs of winter and spring), then based on 100 million pigs nationwide, there would be about 130 billion catties of green fodder reserves. According to the nutritional content they contain, these feeds are equivalent to about 8 billion to 10 billion catties of grain (corn, rice, barley, oats, etc.), or can top about 50 billion catties of bran.

    Because the use of green fodder can greatly save grain and reduce feeding costs, farmers in our country have the habit of collecting various green fodders and grazing in the fields. Recently, with the need to increase the production of various livestock, the collection of green fodder in various places is gradually increasing in terms of variety and quantity, and the methods of feed preparation have also been greatly improved; the experience of using fermented feed is being widely applied in many places. However, there are still many places where not enough attention is paid to this, and organizational leadership should be further strengthened. The most important thing at present is to mobilize relevant units and the broad masses of peasants in various places to seize the opportunity to collect large quantities of green fodder and store it for the needs of this winter and next spring.

    In order to do this work well, relevant departments should organize forces, unify leadership, and clarify the division of labor. Local agricultural departments, livestock and veterinary stations, agricultural technology stations, and local farms should promptly summarize local experiences, plan to cultivate typical examples, and strengthen the guidance of green fodder collection, storage, and preparation through the organization of small-scale visits and technical training. State-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives that manage pig farming in various places should, in line with the policy of actively supporting production, organize a certain amount of manpower to learn in the field, quickly master the technical knowledge of collecting, storing, and preparing green fodder, closely cooperate with agricultural departments to carry out work, and use and reserve green fodder in their own breeding units to play a demonstrative role.

    Agricultural cooperatives in various places should, on the premise of combining agricultural production without delaying agricultural production, widely mobilize forces to participate in the collection and storage of green fodder. In the unified arrangement and use of labor, consideration should be given to the labor time required by cooperatives, teams, and households to collect and store green fodder, and attention should be paid to organizing and mobilizing elderly people, children, and women with semi-labor force to actively participate in this work. Regions with the conditions can also mobilize young people and middle school students to collect green fodder during holidays and team days. Cadres of various organs and organizations can also use voluntary labor time to collect green fodder for their own units or hand it over to agricultural cooperatives and departments that manage pig farming.

    Agricultural cooperatives in various places should also actively help member families solve the difficulties in collecting and storing green fodder, in addition to providing appropriate collection time, appropriate consideration should also be given to transportation capacity. Reasonable remuneration should be given to members for the portion collected for agricultural cooperatives based on quality and quantity. State-owned commercial departments that manage pig farming can purchase a small portion of green fodder according to quality and price as needed.

    解决饲料问题的一个重要途径
　　本报评论员
    6月末，全国生猪饲养数已经达到了一亿一千一百万头，比去年同期饲养数增加了32％，并超过了我国养猪最多的年度——1954年的水平。要巩固和发展这个成绩，还需要继续加强领导，从各方面给养猪事业以有效的支持。目前特别需要注意的是积极地解决饲料问题。要把猪饲料同其他各种牲畜的饲料问题同样加以重视，统筹规划，妥善解决。过去在冬春两季，缺乏饲料的情况往往特别严重；今年应接受过去的教训，及早准备，及早安排。
    夏末、秋季和早冬，正是遍地青草和农作物收割的时期。这时候，应该积极发动群众，和别的农事活动（如除草、治虫、积肥、收获等）密切结合起来，大量采集和储存一切可用于喂猪、养羊和饲养耕畜的青饲料和农作物副产品，以备今冬明春的大量需要。
    我国各地可供家畜食用的青饲料和农作物副产品很多，能喂猪的野生植物漫山遍野到处可见。大部分农作物的茎、叶和藤、蔓，以及各种剩余的蔬菜，都是好饲料。有些省份对这已经做过调查。据河北省调查，只是适宜喂猪的各种野青饲料等就有二百八十五种，计：蔬菜类二十四种，树叶树籽类四十一种，多汁类十三种，水生植物三十一种，野生杂草一百三十五种，农作物副产品（叶、壳）四十一种。实验证明，用这些饲料喂猪确能增膘长重；有些野生饲料猪很爱吃，还加速了育肥的效果。在南方各地种植的
  “紫云英”（草子），据初步化验效果，四斤嫩叶
  （可晒成一斤干菜）相当于一斤麸皮的营养成分。紫云英是用作肥料的，其肥效主要在根部，割取一部分茎叶充作饲料，不会减少肥效。现在有些地方把它全部当作绿肥，没有很好地利用。据有关部门计算，我国南方各省种植紫云英约五千八百万亩，如能充分利用，每亩割取四百斤，即可收青饲草二百三十二亿斤，相当于五十八亿斤麸皮。足见我国青饲料的潜力是很大的。正如农谚说的：“猪吃百样草，看你找不找。”
    大量收储青饲料，在节约饲料粮方面，也有重大的意义。据各地典型调查，养肥一头猪，从小到大，约使用青饲料二千五百斤到三千斤。如果平均每头猪能储存下一千三百斤左右的青饲料（可够冬春两季的需要），全国按一亿头猪计算，就有约一千三百亿斤青饲料的储备。按照它们所含的营养成分换算，这些饲料等于约八十亿斤到一百亿斤粮食（玉米、稻谷、大麦、燕麦等），或者能顶大约五百亿斤统糠。
    因为利用青饲料可以大大的节约粮食和降低饲养成本，所以我国农民是有采集各种青饲料和在田野里放牧的习惯的。近来，随着各种牲畜增产的需要，各地在采集青饲料方面，无论在品种上、数量上，都正在逐步增加，饲料的调制方法也有不少的改进；使用发酵饲料的经验，许多地方都在广泛应用。但是，现在还有不少地方对这注意不够，组织领导应当进一步加强。当前最重要的是动员各地有关单位和广大农民，抓紧时机大量采集青饲料，收藏起来，以应今冬明春的需要。
    为了做好这件工作，有关部门应组织力量，统一领导，明确分工。各地农业部门、畜牧兽医站、农业技术站以及各地农场，要及时总结当地经验，有计划地培养典型，通过组织小型参观和技术传授等办法，加强青饲料的采集、贮藏和调制等工作的指导。各地经营生猪的国营商业部门和供销合作社，应本着积极扶持生产的方针，组织一定力量实地学习，迅速掌握采集、贮存和调制青饲料的技术知识，密切配合农业部门开展工作，并在自己的饲养单位利用和储备青饲料，起示范作用。
    各地农业社应在结合农业生产不误农业生产的前提下，广泛动员力量参加青饲料的收贮工作。在劳动力的统一安排使用上，应照顾到社、队、户需要采集、储存青饲料的劳动时间，并应注意组织和发动具有半劳动力的老年人、儿童和妇女，积极地参加这个工作。有条件的地区也可以动员青年和中小学生，利用假日、队日采集青饲料。各机关团体的干部也可以利用义务劳动的时间采集青饲料，供本单位或交给农业社和经营生猪的部门使用。
    各地农业社还应积极帮助社员家庭解决采集和储存青饲料的困难，除了给予适当的采集时间以外，在运输力量上也应给予适当照顾。对社员为农业社采集的部分，应该采取按质、按量给予合理的报酬。经营生猪的国营商业部门，根据本身需要，可以按质论价收购一小部分青饲料。
