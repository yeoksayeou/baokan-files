Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 6th - Our correspondent Li Yanning reports: July was a month of great strides in the Czechoslovak agricultural cooperativization movement. During this month, 400 unified agricultural cooperatives were newly established nationwide, with 18,000 members and 80,000 hectares of land. Currently, three-fifths of the villages in the country have agricultural cooperatives, and their cultivated land area accounts for more than two-fifths of the total cultivated land area in the country.

The rapid development speed of the agricultural cooperativization movement in July of this year is unprecedented in recent years. In the first seven months of this year, a total of 1,000 new agricultural cooperatives were established nationwide, with those established in July accounting for two-fifths. The achievements of cooperativization in 1956 were already quite good, with an increase of more than 1,200 agricultural cooperatives throughout the year. Judging from the development in the first few months of this year, the achievements in this area will obviously surpass those of last year.

The Czechoslovak agricultural cooperativization movement entered a new stage of development starting in 1955. In February of that year, the Second National Congress of Unified Agricultural Cooperatives was held, and a new upsurge of cooperativization began in the second half of the year. By the spring of this year, agricultural cooperatives already owned 38.7% of the country's cultivated land, and together with the land owned by state-owned farms, socialist agriculture already owned 48% of the country's cultivated land. Considering the fact that the agricultural cooperativization movement was basically stagnant between 1953 and 1955, the significance of the new upsurge of the agricultural cooperativization movement in the past two years is even greater. Between 1953 and 1955, not only did the number of cooperatives increase very little, but the total number of cooperative members and the area of cultivated land also decreased.

After two years of development, the number of agricultural cooperatives in the country has reached 9,000, which is about 35% more than in 1953. The total number of members and the total area of cultivated land are very close to the figures for 1953, and will soon exceed them according to the current development trend.

More importantly, this new upsurge of the cooperativization movement has a healthier and more solid foundation. After 1955, various localities overcame some of the coercive tendencies that had existed in the past. The Party's political work in rural areas and the state's material support for cooperatives have been greatly strengthened. The system of agricultural product procurement and sales has been improved. The decentralization measures that began last year have also facilitated local governments in improving their leadership over agriculture in accordance with local conditions. All of this has improved the management of agricultural cooperatives, further demonstrated the superiority of cooperatives, and thus attracted more individual farmers to join or return to the road of cooperativization.

For example, materials show that from 1953 to 1956, the average yield per unit area of grain for individual farmers increased by only 5%, while that of cooperatives increased by an average of 15%; the meat production of individual farmers increased by 16%, while that of cooperatives increased by 40%. Last year, cooperatives harvested an average of more than 200 kilograms of grain and about 1,000 kilograms of sugar beets per hectare of land more than individual farmers.

In recent years, the income of cooperative farmers has increased year by year. In 1956, the average income of cooperative members per hectare of land was already 1,430 crowns (Czechoslovak currency), while in 1953 it was only 760 crowns. In 1955, about 18% of the cooperatives nationwide were operating at a loss, which had been reduced to 8% in 1956.

    捷农业合作化迈一大步
    上个月成立了四百个农业合作社
    新华社布拉格6日电　本社记者李延宁报道：7月份是捷克斯洛伐克农业合作化运动大踏步前进的一个月。在这一月里，全国新成立了四百个统一农业合作社，它们拥有社员一万八千人和土地八万公顷。目前，全国五分之三的村庄都有了农业合作社，它们的耕地面积占全国总耕地面积五分之二以上。
    今年7月份农业合作化运动的这样快的发展速度，在最近几年中是从来没有过的。在今年头七个月里，全国一共新成立了一千个农业合作社，而7月份成立的就占五分之二。1956年合作化的成绩已经相当好，全年农业合作社增加了一千二百多个。从今年头几个月的发展情况看来，今年这方面的成绩显然要超过去年。
    捷克斯洛伐克农业合作化运动是从1955年开始进入一个新的发展时期的。在这年的2月里召开了第二次全国统一农业合作社代表大会，从下半年起开始了合作化的新高潮。到今年春季，农业合作社已经拥有全国耕地的38.7％，加上国营农场所拥有的土地，社会主义农业已经拥有全国耕地的48％。如果考虑到1953—1955年间农业合作化运动基本上停滞不前这一事实，那么，最近两年来农业合作化运动的新高涨的意义就更大了。在1953—1955年间，合作社不但增加得很少，而且合作社社员总数和耕地面积还减少了。
    经过两年来的发展，到目前为止，全国农业合作社的数目已经达到九千个，即比1953年约多35％，社员总数和耕地总面积则和1953年的数字极为接近，按照目前的发展趋势很快就将超过。
    更重要的是，合作化运动这一新的高涨已经有了更加健康、更加巩固的基础。1955年以后，各地克服了过去曾经存在的一些强迫命令的倾向。党在农村中的政治工作和国家对合作社的物质支援都大大加强了。农产品缴售制度有了改进。去年开始的分权措施也便利了地方政权机构因地制宜地改进对农业的领导。这一切使得农业合作社的经营有了改善，更多地显示了合作社的优越性，从而吸引更多的个体农民走到或者回到合作化的道路上来。
    例如，有材料表明，从1953年到1956年，个体农民的谷物单位面积产量平均只增加了5％，而合作社平均增加了15％；个体农民的肉类产量增加了16％，合作社则增加了40％。去年合作社每公顷土地收获的谷物平均比个体农民多两公担以上，甜菜多十公担左右。
    近几年来，合作社农民的收入年年增加。1956年合作社员在每公顷土地上的平均收入已经有一千四百三十克朗（捷币），而在1953年只有七百六十克朗。1955年全国有亏损的合作社约占18％，1956年已经减为8％。
