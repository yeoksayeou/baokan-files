    Playing Poor and Selling Misery
    She tells everyone
    That within the Party, she is a "poor peasant." She puts on an act of being wronged, as if she has nothing left but her shadow. When the Rightists attacked us—at such a critical moment—she visited door to door, delivering warmth and dynamite, weaving a web of conspiracy like a poisonous spider,妄想如撕裂一把纸扇妄想如撕裂一把纸扇hoping to tear apart the Party's unity like tearing a paper fan. Little did she know that the Party is a steel plate, and only she herself would be crushed.

    Judging the Time
    When the Rightists fiercely attacked us, he said the situation was favorable. When we counterattacked the Rightists, he said the situation was hopeless. The conspiracy had long been exposed, but he pretended not to know. A loyal internal accomplice of the Rightists, a white ant in the bunker, so blinded by anti-Party sentiments that even surrendering would not be too late.

    Manufacturing Rumors
    His mouth is as long as an elephant's trunk. He says to this person that so-and-so is a "factionalist," and to that person that so-and-so is going to "fix" you. He turns the struggle to defend the Party
    Into an evil wind.
    He stirs up discord
    And creates dark clouds,
    Calling our pure Party
    "Factionalist rule." He is busy all day long, running here and there, for a despicable purpose.

    Colluding Internally and Externally
    He armed himself with tons of hatred and screamed at the Party with a rotten "conscience of justice." In front of the Rightists, he became a military advisor, waving his feather fan again and again, praying for the "victory" of the attack. When the Rightists were defeated, he was as distraught as if his parents had died. When asked to confess his anti-Party activities, he claimed he couldn't remember.

    脸谱种种
  　沙鸥
      装穷卖苦
    她逢人便说
    我在党内是一个“贫雇农”她装出受尽委屈仿佛除了影子已一无所有当右派进攻我们——多么严重的时刻她挨家拜访送出温情与炸药像一只有毒的蜘蛛织着阴谋的网妄想如撕裂一把纸扇撕裂党的统一那知党是一块钢板只碰碎了她自己
      看准时机右派猛攻我们他说形势有利我们反击右派他说大势已去阴谋早被戳穿他却装着不知右派的忠实内应碉堡里的白蚁反党冲昏头脑缴械也还不迟
      制造流言他的嘴巴长得如大象的鼻子在这个耳边说某某是“宗派”在那个面前说某某就要“整”你他把保卫党的斗争
    说成是一股阴风
    他挑起不和
    制造乌云
    把我们纯洁的党
    说成是“宗派的统治”他一天到晚忙忙碌碌东奔西跑为了卑鄙的目的
    里应外合他把成吨的仇恨武装了自己向党嘶声喊叫腐朽的“良心正义”他在右派面前成了狗头军师羽毛扇摇了又摇祈祷进攻的“胜利”右派被击退了他如丧考妣要他交出反党活动却说没法记忆
