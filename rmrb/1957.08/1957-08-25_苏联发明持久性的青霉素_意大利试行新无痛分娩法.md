　　Soviet Union invents long-lasting penicillin
　　Italy trials new painless childbirth method
    Long-lasting penicillin
    Soviet doctors recently invented a highly effective penicillin salt – Bicillin – which is very popular in the medical community.
    Bicillin has a high degree of durability. Its normal dosage can maintain an effective concentration in the blood and organs for six to seven days. If the dosage of Bicillin is tripled, then one injection can maintain its medicinal properties in the human body for as long as thirty days. Ordinary penicillin, after being injected into the human body, is quickly excreted from the body. Therefore, in order to maintain its medicinal properties, it must be injected every five or six hours, requiring one hundred and eighty injections a month.
    Plastic eyeglasses
    A Japanese scientist has invented a spectacle lens made of a new type of plastic that is half the weight of ordinary glass lenses, unbreakable, and twice as strong as previously produced British plastic lenses. This lens can transmit 90.5% of light, while ordinary glass lenses can only transmit 88% to 90% of light.
    This plastic lens is most suitable for patients who need to wear high-prescription eyeglasses. At the same time, it is also very suitable for hyperkinetic children with congenital myopia. It does not need to be wiped as often as ordinary lenses to keep it clean.
    Ultrasonic detector
    American scientists have recently invented an ultrasonic detector for examining diseases deep inside the human body. It can emit sound waves with a frequency of 20,000 to 2 million cycles per second, which pass through the human body. By examining the type of sound waves reflected from inside the human body back to the screen, doctors can identify the conditions of diseases inside the human body.
      Miraculous uses of corn oil. Eating more corn oil can reduce the amount of cholesterol in the human blood that can lead to heart disease. This was recently researched by several Canadian doctors.
    They believe that eating foods rich in butter, chicken fat, or lard will increase cholesterol levels. When the heat from corn oil in the food increases to 20% to 60% of the total heat, cholesterol levels will decrease. Complete abstinence from animal fats can lower cholesterol levels, and eating more corn oil at this time can continue to lower it.
    Painless childbirth in hypnotic sound
    In Varido, near Milan, Italy, a special method of painless childbirth was recently trialed. A woman gave birth to a child without any pain under the hypnosis of a phonograph.
    Beside the woman, a phonograph was prepared with a record of a doctor's hypnotic speech. When she began to feel labor pains, the phonograph was turned on. After the child was born, the woman told the midwives that she did not feel any pain at all.
    The woman is thirty years old and has already given birth to one child. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　苏联发明持久性的青霉素
　　意大利试行新无痛分娩法
    持久性的青霉素
    苏联医生最近发明了一种有特效的青霉素盐——比西林，很受医学界的欢迎。
    比西林的持久力很高，它的普通用量可以在血液和器官里保持有效浓度六、七天，如果将比西林的剂量增加三倍，那末，注射一次，就能在人体内保持药性三十天之久。而一般的青霉素注射进人体后，很快就会从肌体里排出，因此，为了要保持药性，每隔五、六小时就要注射一次，一个月须要注射一百八十次。
    塑料眼镜
    日本一个科学家发明了一种用新型塑料制成的眼镜片，比普通玻璃镜片轻一半，而且打不破，比英国以前生产的塑料镜片还要坚固一倍。这种镜片能够透入90.5％的光线，而普通玻璃镜片却只能透入88％到90％的光线。
    这种塑料镜片最适宜于需要戴高度近视眼镜的患者使用，同时，对于患先天性近视眼的好动的小孩也非常适用。它不需要像普通镜片那样经常擦拭，就可以保持清洁。
    超声波探测器
    美国科学家最近发明了一种检查人体内部深处疾患的超声波探测器。它能够发出一种频率为每秒二十到二万千周的声波，通过人体。医生检察从人体内部折回到屏幕上的声波的类型，就可以查明人体内部患病的情况。
      玉蜀黍油的妙用多吃玉蜀黍油，能够使人体血液中能导致心脏病的胆固醇的成分降低。这是加拿大几个医生最近研究出来的。
    他们认为，食用富于牛油、鸡油或猪油的食物，会使胆固醇含量增加。食物中玉蜀黍油的热量增加到总热量的20％到60％时，胆固醇含量便会降低。完全不吃动物性油脂是可以使胆固醇的含量降低的，这时多吃玉蜀黍油还可使它继续下降。
    催眠声中无痛分娩
    在意大利米兰附近的瓦里多，最近试行了一种特别的无痛分娩的方法，一个产妇在留声机的催眠下，毫无痛苦地生下了一个小孩。
    在这位产妇身旁，准备着一架留声机，唱片上录着一位医生进行催眠的讲话。当她开始阵痛的时候，留声机就开放起来，当孩子生下来以后，产妇对接生人员说，她一点都没有感到痛苦。
    这位产妇今年三十岁，已经生过一个小孩。（新华社）
