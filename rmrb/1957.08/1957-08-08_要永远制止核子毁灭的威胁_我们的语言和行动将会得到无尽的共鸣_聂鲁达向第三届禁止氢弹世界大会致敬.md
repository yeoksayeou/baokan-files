Xinhua News Agency, 7th: Pablo Neruda, Vice Chairman of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee and famous Chilean poet, wrote a letter today to the Third World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament, expressing his respects to the representatives attending the conference.

The letter stated, "My friends asked me to represent the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee to attend this conference. I rarely have the opportunity to receive such an honor, but I have no way to attend your discussions. I am spending a vacation on a beach in China, not far from the beautiful Japanese islands, but there is no Japanese consulate in China. If I want to go to Japan, I have to travel halfway around the world to a consulate to apply for a visa, and there is no guarantee that this visa will be obtained."

The letter stated, "Governments continue to be hostile, not interacting, and suspicious of each other. The Cold War prevents us from knowing, understanding, and interacting with each other. In the heyday of nuclear energy, we have returned to the state of the Middle Ages when people of various countries did not interact with each other, and interspersed between non-interaction is the threat of entering an era of blood and fire."

"I am an American on the Pacific coast and a dreamer of the ocean. I have visited people who live at sea, navigators and fishermen, and I have lived with whalers and seal hunters in the South Pacific. I understood at that time that in all countries, all ports, and all remote islands, all the people who live, struggle, and die on this vast ocean should be equal. From childhood, I thought that all these simple people, these villages by the ocean, would be connected through this vast ocean. However, I am very disappointed. The ocean that connects our region has not played a role in connecting us over the years, but has only played a role in separating us. The only flower that grows in this region is the mushroom-shaped smoke of atomic death. The silent ocean has not produced anything useful, but only evil. On our ocean, on this wide road, which could have inspired all kinds of dreams for mankind, there are only the shadows and flashes of nuclear destruction."

The letter also stated that "the millions of people in the Pacific dare not imagine this terrifying scientific preparation, and they hope that we will all help to forever stop this threat in language and action. When our words and actions are spoken and made from the land of Japan - on the land of Japan, where cruel atomic bombs have slaughtered innocent people, and indelible traces remain - then our words and actions will receive endless resonance."

The letter concluded, "Greetings to your peace conference! I sincerely support all resolutions that help to end nuclear weapons testing, permanently ban such weapons, and make this new capability serve the interests of all mankind."

    要永远制止核子毁灭的威胁
    我们的语言和行动将会得到无尽的共鸣
    聂鲁达向第三届禁止氢弹世界大会致敬
    新华社7日讯　亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会副主席、智利著名诗人巴勃罗·聂鲁达今天写信给第三届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会，向参加大会的代表表示敬意。
    信中说，我的朋友们要我代表亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会来参加这次大会。我很少有机会能得到这样的荣誉，但是我没有办法来参加你们的讨论。我正在中国的一个海滨度过一个假期，这个地方距美丽的日本海岛不远，但是在中国没有日本领事馆。我如果要去日本，我就得走过半个世界，到一个领事馆去申请签证，而这签证又不是十分有把握可以得到的。
    信中说，各国政府之间继续互相敌视，不来往，猜忌。冷战妨碍我们相互认识、了解和来往。在核子能的盛世里，我们回到了中世纪时那时各国人民不相往来的状态，而且在不相往来之间，还夹杂着进入血火时代的威胁。
    我是太平洋岸边的一个美洲人，也是一个海洋的梦想者。我访问过生活在海上的人，航行者和渔民，我与南太平洋上猎鲸人和猎取鱼皮的人生活在一起。我当时就了解到，在各国，各个港口，和各个辽远的海岛上，一切生活、斗争和死亡在这个宽广无边的海洋上的人都应该是平等的。我从小时起就想到所有这些纯朴的人，这些海洋边上的村落，都将通过这广大的海洋而联系起来。然而我十分感到失望。联系我们这个地区的大洋这些年来并不发生联系我们的作用，而只发生了分离了我们的作用。在这个地区生长出唯一的花朵是原子死神发出的菌形的烟幕。沉默的海洋没有产生出有用的东西，而只产生了罪恶。在我们的海洋上，在这条宽广的大道上，本来可以使人类产生各种梦想的，现在只有核子毁灭的阴影和闪光。
    信中又说，太平洋千百万人民不敢想像这种恐怖的科学准备工作，按他们希望我们大家在语言上和行动上帮助永远制止这种威胁。当我们的语言和行动是从日本的土地上说出和作出的，——在日本的土地上，残酷的原子弹曾经屠杀了无辜的人民，这里还留着不能遗忘的痕迹，那么我们的语言和行动将会得到无尽的共鸣。
    信中最后说，谨向你们的和平会议致以敬礼！我诚恳支持一切有助于结束核武器试验、永远取缔这种武器和使这种新的能力为全人类的利益服务的决议。
