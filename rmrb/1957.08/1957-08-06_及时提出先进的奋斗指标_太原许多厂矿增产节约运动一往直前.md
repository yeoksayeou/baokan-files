Promptly Propose Advanced Striving Indicators
The Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign in Taiyuan's Many Factories and Mines Advances Courageously

(Our newspaper's dispatch) Since the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party organized a large number of reporters in June to once again publicize the policy of "Building the Country Through Diligence and Thrift" to the broad masses of workers and staff, many factories and mines in Taiyuan City have taken emergency measures to reverse the slack mood of some workers and staff, enabling the increase production and practice economy campaign to develop in depth.

In the previous stage, in some units that were close to completing their annual increase production and practice economy plans, a nonchalant attitude had already emerged, believing that the increase production and practice economy plans could be completed very well without much effort. Leaders of these factories and mines, learning from past lessons, in order to prevent the re-emergence of blind complacency, mobilized workers and staff to adhere to the policy of "Building the Country Through Diligence and Thrift" for many years. Recently, they have respectively revised the increase production and practice economy plans through certain meetings, using higher but reliable increase production and practice economy indicators to promote the in-depth development of the increase production and practice economy campaign. The Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Plant originally planned to save more than 1.53 million yuan for the whole year, and completed more than 1 million yuan in the first half of the year. At the workers' representative conference held in early July, this plant pointed out that there were still many wasteful loopholes in production that needed to be plugged. For example, the waste caused by unstable repair quality was very serious. Among the locomotives repaired from January to May, rework accounted for more than 88%. During the same period, there were also ninety-two reworked and scrapped products in mechanical processing. Based on the results of the representatives' further search for wasteful loopholes, the plant decided to save another 1 million yuan for the state in the second half of the year. The Xishan Mining Bureau promptly revised its original plan to increase raw coal production by 150,000 tons for the whole year to 450,000 tons based on production conditions. Workshops such as the electric furnace steelmaking department, steelmaking department, and ironmaking department of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant also respectively revised their increase production and practice economy plans. The electric furnace steelmaking department originally planned to increase production and practice economy by 1 million yuan for the whole year, and actually completed 1.3 million yuan in the first half of the year. This department decided to complete another 1 million yuan in the second half of the year, and put forward thirty guarantee measures.

    及时提出先进的奋斗指标
    太原许多厂矿增产节约运动一往直前
    本报讯　中共太原市委在6月间组织大批报告员再次向广大职工宣传“勤俭建国”的方针以来，太原市许多厂矿采取紧急措施，扭转了部分职工的松劲情绪，使增产节约运动深入开展起来。
    前一阶段，在某些接近完成全年增产节约计划的单位，已经出现了满不在乎的论调，以为不用费劲也可以把增产节约计划完成得很好。这些厂矿的领导人员接受以往的教训，为了防止盲目自满情绪的重新抬头，发动职工长年坚持贯彻“勤俭建国”的方针，最近都分别通过一定的会议及时修订了增产节约计划，用更高而又可靠的增产节约指标来促进增产节约运动的深入开展。太原机车车辆修理厂，原计划全年节约一百五十三万余元，前半年就完成了一百多万元；这个厂在7月初召开的职工代表大会上，指出生产中还有许多浪费的漏洞需要堵塞，例如检修质量不稳定所造成的浪费就很严重，在1至5月份检修的机车中，返工的占88％以上，同期内，机械加工发生的返工废品也有九十二件。根据代表们进一步寻找浪费漏洞的结果，这个厂决定在下半年再为国家节约一百万元。西山矿务局及时根据生产情况，将原计划全年增产原煤十五万吨修改为四十五万吨。太原钢铁厂电炉炼钢部、炼钢部、炼铁部等车间，也分别修订了增产节约计划。电炉炼钢部原计划全年增产节约一百万元，前半年实际完成一百三十万元，这个部决定后半年再完成一百万元，并提出了三十项保证措施。
