　　Zorin Condemns Western Countries' Inaction on Disarmament
　  The West Plays New Tricks to Continue Obstructing the Cessation of Nuclear Testing
　　Our correspondent in London, August 21st. The Disarmament Subcommittee continued its meeting today. It had been five days since the last meeting. Today's meeting was convened at the insistence of the Soviet representative, Zorin.
　　As everyone knows, the work of the Disarmament Subcommittee was originally scheduled to conclude at the end of July. Due to the deliberate delays by Western countries, the meeting failed to end as scheduled. Recently, Western countries have on the one hand requested that the meeting continue, but on the other hand have repeatedly "suggested" postponing the meeting. Thus, a situation has arisen in which the disarmament conference neither ends nor meets on time; Western countries neither express their attitude towards the Soviet proposals nor seriously put forward their own counter-proposals.
　　In his speech today, Zorin urged the representatives of Western countries to pay attention to this extremely abnormal situation in the Disarmament Subcommittee.
　　Zorin said: The Subcommittee being forced to repeatedly suspend its meetings, and the representatives of Western countries evading discussion of the immediate cessation of nuclear testing, can only be regarded as: Western countries are unwilling to take any real steps to stop the atomic arms race and eliminate the threat of atomic war.
　　After pointing out the West's dilatory attitude on this issue, Zorin said: Western countries are erecting more and more obstacles to reaching an agreement on the cessation of nuclear weapons testing. They originally put forward two preconditions, namely, that the cessation of testing must be linked to the reduction of armed forces and conventional armaments, and to the cessation of production of fissionable materials for military purposes. Now, they have put forward a third precondition: linking the cessation of testing to the establishment of aerial inspection zones and ground monitoring posts. Zorin asked: What is the need or reason to artificially link the simple and urgent issue of the cessation of testing with other complex issues? Does this not clearly mean, in essence, an indefinite delay in making a decision on the cessation of testing?
　　Another dispatch: After Zorin's speech, the Western representatives put forward an oral proposal on the cessation of nuclear weapons testing. The content of this proposal is: The cessation of testing will be carried out in two phases. After the first stage of disarmament takes effect, testing will be suspended for twelve months, but an agreement must first be reached on the establishment of monitoring posts in the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, the Pacific "and other necessary areas". If this inspection system is "satisfactory" and "the countries concerned make satisfactory progress in planning a system to stop the production of fissionable materials for military purposes," then the suspension of testing will continue for another twelve months.
　　Western representatives emphasized that this was a "major move" on their part to promote an agreement. However, this proposal is actually only extending the ten-month limit for the suspension of testing, which the West originally insisted on, by two months. Requiring so-called "satisfactory progress" as a condition for continuing the suspension of testing is, in effect, pre-arranging an excuse for Western countries to resume testing. Therefore, in reality, the West's basic position has not changed. They are still unwilling to agree to a longer period of suspension of testing and are linking the cessation of testing to other complex issues, thereby obstructing the resolution of this issue.

### 佐林斥责西方国家对裁军怠工  西方耍新花招继续阻挠停止核试验

　　佐林斥责西方国家对裁军怠工
　  西方耍新花招继续阻挠停止核试验
    本报伦敦21日电　裁军小组委员会在今天继续举行会议。它和上次会议间隔了五天之久。今天的会议，是在苏联代表佐林的坚持要求下召开的。
    大家知道，裁军小组的工作原定在7月底告一段落。由于西方国家的故意拖延，会议未能如期结束。最近，西方国家一面要求会议继续进行，但另一面又不止一次地“建议”延期开会。于是，就出现了这样的情况：裁军会议既不结束，又不按时开会；西方国家既不对苏联的建议表明态度，又不认真地提出自己的对案。
    佐林在今天的发言中，敦促西方国家代表注意裁军小组委员会这一极不正常的状况。
    佐林说：小组委员会被迫连续停止开会，以及西方国家代表回避讨论立即停止核试验的问题，这只能被认为：西方国家不愿在停止原子军备竞赛和消除原子战争的威胁方面，采取任何真正的步骤。
    在指出了西方国家在这一问题上的怠工态度之后，佐林说：西方国家正在为达成停止核武器试验的协议树立愈来愈多的障碍。他们原来提出了两个先决条件，即停止试验必须同裁减武装部队和常规军备联系起来，同停止生产军用裂变物质联系起来。现在，他们又提出了第三个先决条件：把停止试验同建立空中视察区和地面监察哨联系起来。佐林问道：把停止试验这一简单而紧急的问题，同其他一些复杂的问题人为地牵扯到一起，有何必要？有无理由？难道这不是明显地意味着在实质上是一种无限期地拖延就停止试验作出决定吗？
    又电　在佐林发言之后，西方代表提出了一项关于停止核武器试验的口头建议。这个建议的内容是：停止试验分两期进行。在裁军的第一阶段生效后，停止试验十二个月，但必须先就在美国、英国、苏联、太平洋“及其他必要地区”设立监察哨达成协议。如果这一检查制度能“令人满意”，并且“各有关国家就策划一个停止生产军用裂变物质制度有令人满意的进展”，则继续停止试验十二个月。
    西方代表强调说，这是他们为了促进达成协议的“重大行动”。但是，这个建议实际上不过是把西方原来坚持的、只停止试验十个月的期限延长两个月。要求所谓“令人满意的进展”作为继续停止试验的条件，实际上是为西方国家恢复试验预先安排借口。所以实际上西方国家的基本立场并未改变。他们仍然是不愿意同意较长时期的停止试验，而把停止试验同其他复杂的问题联系起来，从而阻挠这个问题的解决。
