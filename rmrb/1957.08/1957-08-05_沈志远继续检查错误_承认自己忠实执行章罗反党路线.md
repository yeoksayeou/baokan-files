    Shen Zhiyuan Continues to Examine Errors
    Admits to Faithfully Implementing the Zhang-Luo Anti-Party Line

    (Reported by this newspaper) Shen Zhiyuan, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League and Director of the Preparatory Office of the Shanghai Institute of Economics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, continued to confess his errors in accepting and implementing the Zhang-Luo alliance's principles and lines at a symposium of philosophical and social science workers in Shanghai on July 31.

    Shen Zhiyuan said that, concerning the national political system and the status and role of democratic parties, in addition to acting as a mouthpiece for Zhang Bojun's "bicameral system," he also tried his best to support and implement Zhang Bojun's proposal to establish a "Policy Research Committee" for the democratic parties to participate in the "design" and "construction" of national policies. He had requested the establishment of a "Policy Research Committee" at meetings of the Shanghai Democratic League more than once, but it was not realized because the majority of people thought it was unnecessary. Regarding how to implement "mutual supervision," he also put forward a proposition of "prior supervision." He admitted that this was essentially an attempt to share equal footing with the Communist Party and negate the leadership of the Communist Party at the grassroots level.

    Shen Zhiyuan admitted that the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League had accepted instructions from the Zhang-Luo alliance to hold multiple symposiums on the issue of intellectuals, collecting exaggerated shortcomings and deviations, and making various unreasonable demands to the Party that were difficult to meet, in order to incite intellectuals' dissatisfaction with the Party. On the issue of the work of intellectuals, instead of playing a role as an assistant to the Party, it played the role of an opponent.

    Shen Zhiyuan said that his relationship with the Shanghai small clique of the Zhang-Luo alliance can be divided into two stages. From the winter of 1951 when he arrived in Shanghai until 1956, because he regarded his personal position as higher than everything else, he was drawn in and utilized by this small clique, gradually developing to the point of trusting them, relying on them, and alienating and excluding progressive elements. From the reorganization of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League last year until recently, his relationship with this small clique developed into complete cooperation, jointly implementing the reactionary line of the Zhang-Luo alliance. Among the members of this Municipal Committee of the Democratic League, rightists accounted for a quarter. Except for a few units such as the Organization Department, the various departments and committees of the Municipal Committee of the Democratic League were mostly controlled by rightist elements. Most of the people on this list were nominated by Chen Renbing and Sun Siming, members of the small clique.

    Shen Zhiyuan exposed the conspiracy in the process of drafting the concluding remarks at the National Work Conference of the China Democratic League this spring. He said that the initial draft of the concluding remarks was compiled from the records of each group discussion, organized by Huang Yaomian, and reviewed by him. The later final draft was actually completely rewritten, abandoning most of the important content of the initial draft, especially some major principles and lines of argument. Such as the issue of supervision and Party leadership, the basis for long-term coexistence, and the fact that strengthening political and ideological education work is the primary task of the Democratic League at present. In the final draft, all of these were completely deleted, with no mention of the leadership of the Communist Party at all, fully embodying the reactionary line of the Zhang-Luo alliance. At the meeting, everyone welcomed Shen Zhiyuan's admission of errors and hoped that he would continue to thoroughly confess. (Xinhua News Agency Special Dispatch)

### 沈志远继续检查错误  承认自己忠实执行章罗反党路线

    沈志远继续检查错误
    承认自己忠实执行章罗反党路线
    本报讯　民盟上海市委主任委员、中国科学院上海经济研究所筹备处主任沈志远，7月31日在上海哲学社会科学工作者座谈会上，继续交代他接受和贯彻章罗联盟方针路线的错误。
    沈志远说，在国家政治制度和民主党派的地位作用方面，他除作了章伯钧的“两院制”的传声筒以外，对章伯钧的成立民主党派的“政策研究委员会”以参加国家方针政策的“设计”和“施工”的主张，他也是尽力赞同并力求贯彻的。他在上海民盟的会议上就曾不止一次要求成立“政策研究委员会”，因多数人认为没有必要，没有实现。对于如何贯彻“互相监督”，他还提出一种“事先监督论”的主张，他承认，这实质上是企图和共产党平分秋色，否定基层单位内共产党的领导。
    沈志远承认，民盟上海市委曾接受章罗联盟指示就知识分子问题召开了多次座谈会，搜集被夸大了的缺点和偏差，向党提出各种很难满足的不合理的要求，以挑起知识分子对党不满。在知识分子工作问题上，对党不是起助手作用，而是起了敌手作用。
    沈志远说，他和上海的章罗联盟小集团的关系可分为两个阶段。1951年冬他到上海后直到1956年，由于他把个人地位看得高于一切，他被这个小集团拉拢利用，一步步发展到信任他们，依靠他们，疏远和排挤进步分子。去年民盟上海市委改选后直到最近，他同这个小集团的关系发展到完全合作，共同贯彻章罗联盟的反动路线。这一届的民盟市委委员中，右派占四分之一，除组织部等少数单位外，民盟市委各部、委多为右派分子所把持。这份名单中的绝大多数人是由小集团分子陈仁炳、孙斯鸣提名的。
    沈志远揭发了今春民盟全国工作会议在草拟总结发言过程中的阴谋。他说，总结发言初稿是汇集各分组发言记录而成的，由黄药眠整理、经他审阅的。后来的定稿，实际上已完全重写过，把初稿中极大部分重要内容特别是一些重大方针路线的论点都抛弃了。如关于监督和党的领导问题，关于长期共存的根据，关于加强政治思想教育工作是民盟当前首要的任务等。在定稿中，所有这些都全被删去，一点不提共产党的领导，完全体现了章罗联盟的反动路线。会上，大家对沈志远的承认错误表示欢迎，希望他继续彻底交代。（新华社专稿）
