    This newspaper reports that the China Film Workers Association convened a symposium on August 4th, attended by more than 180 people from the capital's film industry, to expose and criticize Zhong Dianfei's (currently a member of the editorial board of "Wenyi Bao") anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds in launching a frenzied attack on the Party with his "The Drumbeats of Cinema."
    Cai Chusheng, Chairman of the Film Workers Association, presided over the meeting and first pointed out the serious harm that Zhong Dianfei's "The Drumbeats of Cinema" and "For Progress" had caused to the people's film industry. He asked the comrades present to launch a debate, thoroughly criticize Zhong Dianfei's reactionary words and deeds, and defend the socialist film industry.
    Chen Huangmei used concrete facts to illustrate how Zhong Dianfei, as a Party member, wearing the cloak of Marxism-Leninism, attacked the Party on film issues, which was the first fire set by the bourgeois right wing in this area. Chen Huangmei pointed out that Zhong Dianfei not only did not conduct a profound self-criticism, but also colluded with other right-wing elements during the Great Blooming and Letting Contend period, attempting to use "Wenyi Bao" to continue anti-Party activities.
    The symposium revealed many materials proving that after the Party put forward the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, Zhong Dianfei spread various fallacies, negated the achievements of the film industry after liberation, attributed all shortcomings to adhering to the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, denounced it as sectarianism, and sowed discord in the unity of the film and literary circles, slandering and attacking the leadership of the Party.

    The Signal for Attack, "The Drumbeats of Cinema,"
    Earned Applause from the Right Wing and Taiwan
    In October of last year, when Zhong Dianfei was still working in the Literature and Art Department of the Central Propaganda Department, he summoned reporters from Guangming Daily without asking for instructions from his leaders, providing them with materials and asking Guangming Daily to initiate a discussion on film issues. He also said that he would write an article to be published in the People's Daily. Yao Fangzao, a reporter from Wenhui Bao, heard this news from Zhong Dianfei and hurriedly suggested to Pu Xixiu at the Shanghai editorial office that they preemptively launch a discussion on film issues. As a result, Chen Renbing, a backbone member of the right-wing of the China Democratic League, began to set fires at the Shanghai Film Studio, launching a frenzied attack.
    Prior to this, Zhong Dianfei had written an article for the People's Daily entitled "Several Questions on the Guiding Ideology of Cinema." This article was rejected after discussion by the editorial department of the newspaper. Leading comrades of the Central Propaganda Department also criticized the erroneous viewpoints of this article. However, Zhong Dianfei not only did not correct his mistakes but intensified his reactionary stance. After he was transferred to work at "Wenyi Bao," he immediately published "The Drumbeats of Cinema" under the name of "Wenyi Bao" commentator to cooperate with Wenhui Bao's so-called "film discussion," attacking the Party's leadership of the film industry from all sides. Facts have proven that Wenhui Bao's article solicitation plan regarding film discussions had been reviewed by Zhong Dianfei. When Wenhui Bao published Sima Rui's article refuting some erroneous viewpoints, he called the Beijing office of Wenhui Bao, criticizing them for not publishing the article and quickly wrote "For Progress" under the pseudonym Zhu Zhuzhu, openly advocating that films should regress to the capitalist road. These two articles were systematic anti-Party and anti-socialist programs on film issues, greatly supporting and encouraging the then-Wenhui Bao and the frenzied attacks of the right-wing elements.
    This film drumbeat caused ideological confusion in the film industry, but it earned praise from Luo Longji, who called it "a pioneer in setting the trend"; at the same time, it received applause from Taiwan, calling it "the mainland's anti-tyranny film drumbeat!" This so-called "film discussion" was actually the first signal of the bourgeois right-wing's frenzied attack on the Party's cultural and educational undertakings!

    Opposing the Party's Leadership of the Film Industry
    Opposing the Direction of Serving Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers
    In August of last year, Zhong Dianfei also published a miscellaneous essay in the People's Daily under the pseudonym Jin Xiulong, entitled "Such a 'Scientific' View," maliciously satirizing the Party's leadership of the film industry. He said: "There are bureaus and factories, each performing its duties, and the equipment and systems can be said to be the most modern. But the output is low, and there are few good films! Isn't this like holding a golden rice bowl begging for food?" He sang in tune with other right-wing elements, believing that the phenomenon of "laymen leading professionals" existed in the film industry; "many of the current leaders are 'appointed' from above," implying that these people should be overthrown. He also attacked the Party's leading organs, saying: "Small organs have small sectarianism, and the real big sectarianism is in the Party's high-level organs."
    In several articles, Zhong Dianfei completely negated the achievements of the Party's leadership of the film industry after liberation. He did not mention the criticism of "The Life of Wu Xun," the rectification of literature and art, ideological remolding, and other major movements, but attributed the complex situation of the small number of feature films produced in the early days of liberation to sectarianism and the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, believing that the terms "worker-peasant-soldier films" and "people's films" were all sectarianism; and he believed that: "The more people in charge, the greater the obstacles to the growth of films... During the period when the Ministry of Culture established the Film Guidance Committee, the leadership was stronger than ever, but as a result, there was not a single feature film produced in the whole year!" Therefore, Zhong Dianfei opposed the policy of films serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and openly issued a call for "regression."

    Resisting Criticism, Attempting to "Reverse the Verdict"
    Continuing Anti-Party Activities
    Comrades Zhang Guangnian, Hou Jinjing, and Chen Xiaoyu made a joint statement on behalf of the editorial department of "Wenyi Bao." They said that in February of this year, the responsible comrade of the Party Central Committee had already given severe criticism to the article "The Drumbeats of Cinema," but Zhong Dianfei had not conducted a profound self-criticism and attempted to reverse the verdict during the rectification campaign, continuing to attack the Party. Wang Changqing of "Dazhong Dianying" (Popular Cinema) revealed that in early June, Zhong Dianfei also said: "In the future, how will this historical account of the dispute over the film drumbeats be written? It is still difficult to say." Comrade Chen Mo of "Wenyi Bao" revealed that during the Great Blooming and Letting Contend period, at the Party's group meeting, Zhong Dianfei insidiously asked others to put up big-character posters questioning him, asking: "Comrade Zhong Dianfei, are you afraid of losing your position as a member of the editorial board and dare not speak out?" so that he could take the opportunity to launch an unbridled attack on the Party.
    Zhong Dianfei also said that in the film drumbeat debate, he had "fought bare-chested," and would not do so in the future. He believed that during the rectification campaign, Wenhui Bao's attempt to knock on the door of the Film Bureau was unsuccessful, but "Wenyi Bao" still had to knock!
    Sure enough, "The First Voice of Changying" rang out. Zhong Dianfei presided over this symposium, and many parts of the reporter Luo Dou's inflammatory report were processed and embellished by Zhong Dianfei; he himself admitted that the viewpoint in "The First Voice of Changying" was actually his own. According to Zhang Wang, deputy director of Changchun Film Studio, Zhong Dianfei told actors at Changying that he wanted to go to Changying to "understand the situation," and could notify "Wenyi Bao" to send someone there after the blooming and contention began. Sure enough, during the Great Blooming and Letting Contend period, the Changying Actors' Troupe caused trouble, went on strike, and refused to accept assignments, while sending a telegram to "Wenyi Bao" requesting to send a reporter to Changying. Zhong Dianfei did not ask for instructions from the editor-in-chief in advance, and hurriedly sent Luo Dou to Changying. Luo Dou was very active after arriving at Changying. When the anti-Party group of the Changying Orchestra attempted to usurp leadership and establish a presidium composed of twelve people, Luo Dou actively encouraged and supported them.
    After making serious mistakes, the Party still allowed Zhong Dianfei to serve as a member of the editorial board of "Wenyi Bao," responsible for the art department, but he did not repent. Instead, he continued his anti-Party activities, which particularly aroused everyone's anger.
    Xu Xiaobing, Lu Su, Huang Gang, and others also spoke at the meeting. Huang Gang refuted Zhong Dianfei's various fallacies from a theoretical point of view. Xu Xiaobing criticized Zhong Dianfei's slander against newsreel films. Zhong Dianfei believed that the people did not want to watch newsreel films with political education significance. When he worked at the Newsreel Film Studio, he attempted to transform newsreel films using bourgeois vulgar methods.
    Lu Su of the Experimental Opera House pointed out in his speech that Zhong Dianfei not only attacked the Party in the film industry, but also lit a fire in the music industry. During the rectification campaign, Zhong Dianfei colluded with right-wing elements in the opera house and directed "Wenyi Bao" reporter Long Chundi to carry out activities, successively publishing the distorted and inflammatory articles "About Me" and "After the Publication of Comrade Zhang Quan's Article About Me." In the latter article, he falsely accused the opera house of opening Zhang Quan's letters privately, which was not the case at all. Zhong Dianfei also spread rumors saying: "After 'About Me' was published, Zhang Quan could not stay in Beijing, and the opera house wanted to investigate the list of people who participated in the symposium," etc., trying to incite the actors to make trouble. The symposium will continue.

### 钟惦棐在党内里应外合  放起右派向党进攻的第一把火

    钟惦棐在党内里应外合
    放起右派向党进攻的第一把火
    本报讯　中国电影工作者联谊会在8月4日召集首都电影界人士一百八十余人举行座谈会，揭露和批判打起“电影的锣鼓”向党猖狂进攻的钟惦棐（现任“文艺报”编委）的反党、反社会主义的言行。
    联谊会主席蔡楚生主持会议，首先指出钟惦棐写的“电影的锣鼓”、“为了前进”对人民电影事业的严重危害性，要求到会的同志展开辩论，彻底批判钟惦棐的反动言行，捍卫社会主义的电影事业。
    陈荒煤用具体事实说明了钟惦棐以党员身份，披着马列主义外衣，在电影问题上向党进攻，是资产阶级右派在这一方面所放的第一把火。陈荒煤指出，钟惦棐不但没有进行深刻的检查，反而在大鸣大放时期，同其他右派分子里应外合，企图利用文艺报继续进行反党的活动。
    座谈会上揭露了许多材料，证明在党提出百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针后，钟惦棐就散放种种谬论，抹煞解放后的电影事业的成绩，把一切缺点都归根于坚持工农兵方向，而斥之为宗派主义，并且挑拨电影界、文艺界的团结，诬蔑和攻击党的领导。
    进攻信号“电影的锣鼓”
    博得右派和台湾的喝采
    去年10月，钟惦棐还在中央宣传部文艺处工作的时候，他没有向领导请示，就擅自召集光明日报记者，供给他们资料，要光明日报发起电影问题的讨论。他还说：自己也要写文章在人民日报发表。文汇报记者姚芳藻在钟惦棐处听到了这个消息，就急忙向浦熙修建议上海编辑部，抢先发起了电影问题的讨论。于是，民盟右派骨干分子陈仁炳就开始在上海电影制片厂放火，发动疯狂的进攻。
    在这之前，钟惦棐就给人民日报写了一篇题为“论电影指导思想的几个问题”的文章。这篇文章，在报社编辑部经过讨论后被否定了。中央宣传部的领导同志也批评了这篇文章的错误论点。可是，钟惦棐不仅不改正错误，反而变本加厉地坚持他的反动立场，当他调到文艺报工作后，就立即用文艺报评论员的名义发表了“电影的锣鼓”来配合文汇报的所谓“电影讨论”，从各方面来攻击电影事业的党的领导。事实证明，文汇报关于电影讨论的组稿计划都经过钟惦棐看过。当文汇报发表司马瑞的文章反驳一些错误论点时，他就打电话给文汇报北京办事处，批评他们不应该发表这篇文章，并且赶快用朱煮竹的化名写了“为了前进”的文章，公开主张电影要倒退到资本主义道路上去。这两篇文章是电影问题上的系统的反党反社会主义纲领，大大地支持和鼓舞了当时的文汇报和右派分子的猖狂进攻。
    这场电影锣鼓在电影界造成思想混乱，然而却博得罗隆基的赞扬，称之为“开风气之先”；同时，获得了台湾方面的喝采，称为“大陆反暴的电影锣鼓！”这场所谓“电影讨论”实际上是资产阶级右派向党的文教事业疯狂进攻的第一个信号！
    反对党对电影事业的领导
    反对为工农兵服务的方向
    钟惦棐还在去年8月化名金绣龙在人民日报发表了一篇杂文“如此‘科学’观”，就恶意地讽刺电影事业的党的领导。他说：“有局有厂，各司其职，而且装备与制度，都可以说是最新式的。但就是出片少，而且好片少！这岂不是捧着金饭碗讨饭。”他同其它右派一鼻孔出气，认为“外行领导内行”的现象在电影界是存在的；“目前不少领导都是上面‘封’”的，言下之意，这些人都应该被打倒。他还攻击党的领导机关，说：“小机关有小宗派主义，真正大宗派主义在党的高级机关。”
    钟惦棐在几篇文章中完全否定解放后党对电影事业领导的成绩，对“武训传”的批判，文艺整风、思想改造等重大运动只字不提，却把解放初期故事片产量不多的复杂情况，一概归根于宗派主义和工农兵方向，认为“工农兵电影”“人民电影”的提法都是宗派主义；并且认为：“管的人越多，对电影的成长阻碍也越大……文化部成立电影指导委员会时期，领导力量比任何时候都强大，但结果，却是全年没有一部故事片！”因此，钟惦棐反对电影为工农兵服务的方针，公开发出“倒退”的号召。
    抗拒批评，企图“翻案”
    继续进行反党活动
    张光年、侯金镜、陈笑雨三位同志代表文艺报编辑部作了联合发言，他们说，今年2月间，党中央负责同志已经对“电影的锣鼓”这篇文章给予严厉的批评，但钟惦棐一直没有进行深刻的检查和自我批评，并在整风期间企图翻案，继续向党进攻。大众电影王长庆揭发，6月初，钟惦棐还表示：“电影的锣鼓这场争论，将来这笔历史怎么写，现在还很难说呢？”文艺报陈默同志揭发大放大鸣期间，在党的小组会上，钟惦棐竟然阴险地要别人出来贴质问他的大字报，问：“钟惦棐同志，你是不是怕丢掉了编委的乌纱帽，而不敢出来讲话？”以便他可以借口放手地向党进攻。
    钟惦棐还说，在电影锣鼓这场论争中，他是“赤膊上阵”，以后就不会这样干了。他认为整风期间，文汇报去敲电影局的门没有敲开，但文艺报还是要去敲的！
    果然，“长影的第一个声音”就敲起来了，这个座谈会是钟惦棐主持的，记者罗斗这篇富于煽动性的报道，许多地方是经过钟惦棐加工、润色的；他自己承认，“长影第一个声音”中的观点实际上也就是他自己的观点。据长春电影制片厂副厂长张望揭发：钟惦棐向长影演员表示，他很想去长影“了解情况”，鸣放起来后可以通知文艺报派人去。果然大鸣大放期间，长影演员剧团闹事罢演，拒绝接受任务，同时就打电报给文艺报要求派记者去长影。钟惦棐事先未向总编辑请示，即赶忙派罗斗去长影。罗斗到长影后非常活跃，当长影乐团反党集团企图篡夺领导，成立由十二人组成的主席团时，罗斗即积极鼓动、支持。
    钟惦棐在犯了严重错误后，党仍让他作文艺报编委，负责艺术部工作，但是他并没有悔悟，反而继续其反党活动，这种行为尤其引起大家的愤怒。
    在会议上发言的还有徐肖冰、芦肃、黄钢等人。黄钢从理论上驳斥了钟惦棐的种种谬论。徐肖冰批驳了钟惦棐对于新闻纪录电影的诬蔑。钟惦棐认为人民群众不愿观看具有政治教育意义的新闻纪录片，当他在新闻纪录电影制片厂工作时，企图用资产阶级庸俗手法来改造新闻纪录片。
    实验歌剧院芦肃的发言，指出钟惦棐不但在电影方面向党进攻，而且在音乐界点了一把火。钟惦棐在整风中勾结歌剧院的右派分子，并且指挥文艺报记者龙春第进行活动，连续发表了歪曲事实的煽动性的“关于我”和“张权同志关于我一文发表以后”两文。在后一篇文章中，诬蔑歌剧院私拆张权的信，实际上根本不是这么一回事。钟惦棐还造谣说：“关于我”发表以后，张权在北京不能呆了，歌剧院要追究参加座谈会的人名单等等，想煽动演员闹事。座谈会将继续进行。
