Xinhua News Agency, 6th dispatch: The Rectification Leading Group of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic Party held a symposium on July 26th in the agricultural and forestry sectors to expose the conspiratorial activities of rightists such as Zhang Bojun and Li Boqiu in stirring up trouble in these sectors. The participants were agricultural experts and technicians who had been deceived by Zhang and Li but had become clear-headed through the anti-rightist struggle. At the symposium, it was unanimously pointed out that in order to ignite trouble in the agricultural and forestry sectors, Zhang Bojun and Li Boqiu first gathered their core rightist elements, including Zeng Xianpu (Director of the Agricultural Department General Branch of the China Democratic Party), Wang Zhenxin (Commissioner of the Ministry of Agriculture, member of the General Branch of the China Democratic Party), and Shen Zengkan (Technician of the Ministry of Agriculture, member of the China Democratic Party), and "advised" them in person while treating them to meals, asking them to be responsible for contacting people, making lists, and finding more dissatisfied people to participate in the symposium.

Many people at the meeting exposed the insidious methods used by Li Boqiu and others in stirring up trouble. Huang Jifang and Wang Qimei said that at the first symposium, Li Boqiu first made an "enlightening" speech, saying, "I have already criticized party members for their privileged thinking at the United Front Department symposium. I became the Director of the Commercial Bureau through struggle, with power and authority." This incited everyone to confront the Communist Party. At that time, a female comrade sitting next to him immediately chimed in, saying, "Communist Party members have very strong privileged thinking!" At this point, Li Boqiu immediately introduced her to everyone, saying, "This is Li Jiansheng, Deputy Director of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic Party." Later, whenever this female comrade heard dissatisfied people speak out against the Party, she would always smile or nod in agreement from the sidelines, interjecting with supportive remarks.

Wang Qimei, Li Shutang, and others revealed: "Once, when a symposium went on until 10:30 PM, Zhang Bojun hurried over. Li Boqiu immediately said, 'Chairman Zhang is here; he attaches great importance to this meeting.'" After Zhang sat down, he heard rightist elements such as Shen Zengkan slander Communist Party members for having three pairs of glasses, attacking the experience of close planting of cotton in Xinjiang and the double-wheeled double-shared plow, and saying that not only should questions be raised, but opinions should also be put forward. Zhang Bojun praised them, saying, "This opinion is very good; it should be published in the newspaper." The meeting revealed many fallacies from the four symposiums. The most significant one was: a professor from the Agricultural University said, "Now professors are controlled by teaching assistants, and party members who do not understand technology cannot lead science." Li Boqiu immediately asked deliberately, "Is that teaching assistant a party member? No wonder!" Rightist element Shen Zengkan viciously vilified party members, saying, "Party members have three pairs of glasses: one is a microscope to look at old personnel, one is a magnifying glass to look at themselves, and one is wearing red-colored glasses." When Shen Zengkan said that party members still had nearsightedness, Li Boqiu immediately interjected, "They should wear nearsighted glasses!" Shen Zengkan also said, "The Personnel Department is the personnel police, and the personnel secretary is the police station." Rightist element Wang Zhenxin, in order to incite everyone, deliberately brought up other people's issues of being purged at the meeting, "venting grievances" for them. Rightist element Guo Shufan exaggerated the so-called "Zuo Ye incident" several times at the symposium, demanding the removal of Zuo Ye, the person in charge of the Party Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture, in an attempt to overthrow the Party's leadership. Li Boqiu also emboldened dissatisfied people. He said, "It is legal to speak here; the China Democratic Party supports you." "Speaking through the organization has power."

    章伯钧李伯球李健生居心可恶
    推涛作浪煽动农林界反共反人民
    曾受右派欺骗现在清醒过来的农业专家们揭穿了这一阴谋
    据新华社6日讯　农工民主党北京市委会整风领导小组，7月26日召开农林界座谈会，揭发右派分子章伯钧、李伯球等在农林界点火的阴谋活动。参加座谈会的都是曾受章、李欺骗而经过反右派斗争清醒过来的农业专家、技师等。座谈会上，一致指出：章伯钧、李伯球为了在农林界点火，首先约集他们的骨干右派分子曾宪朴（农工民主党农业部总支主任委员）、王枕心（农业部专员、农工总支委员）、沈曾侃（农业部技师、农工党员）等，利用请客吃饭，向他们面授“机宜”，要他们负责联系、开名单、多找不满分子参加座谈会。
    会上许多人揭发李伯球等在点火当中的阴险手法。黄季芳、王启美说，在第一次座谈会召开时，李伯球首先作“启发”讲话，他说：“我在统战部座谈会上就已批评党员有特权思想。我当商业局长有职有权是斗争来的”。煽动大家同共产党对抗。当时在旁边坐了一位女同志，她也立即帮腔说：“共产党员的特权思想很浓厚！”这时李伯球马上给大家介绍说：“这位是农工北京市委会副主任委员李健生。”以后这位女同志听到不满分子发言攻击党的时候，总在一旁时而笑笑，时而点点头，插话帮腔。
    王启美、李树棠等揭发：“一次座谈会开到十点半钟的时候，章伯钧匆匆忙忙赶来了，李伯球马上说：“章主席来了，他很重视这个会”。章坐下后，听到右派分子沈曾侃等诬蔑共产党员有三付眼镜、攻击新疆密植棉花经验和双轮双铧犁等问题，并且说不但要提问题，还要提出意见时，章伯钧夸奖说：“这个意见很好，要见报”。会上纷纷揭发了四次座谈会上的许多谬论。最显著的有：一位农大教授说：“现在教授听助教支配，党员不懂技术，不能领导科学”。李伯球马上故意问：“那位助教是党员吧？难怪如此！”右派分子沈曾侃恶毒地丑化党员，说：“党员有三副眼镜：一副是显微镜看旧人员，一副是放大镜看自己，一副是带着红色眼镜。”当沈曾侃说党员还是近视眼时，李伯球马上接口说：“应该带上近视眼镜！”沈曾侃还说：“人事司是人事警察，人事秘书是派出所”。右派分子王枕心为了煽动大家，在会上故意把别人的肃反问题提出来，替人“吐苦水”。右派分子郭树藩曾在座谈会几次夸大所谓“左叶事件”。要求撤换农业部党委负责人左叶，企图推翻党的领导。李伯球还为不满分子壮胆。他说：“在这儿说话是合法的，有农工党支持”。“通过组织说话有力量”。
