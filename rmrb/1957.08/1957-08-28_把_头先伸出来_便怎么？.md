What If You Stick Your Head Out First?
　　Xia Ren

　　A rightist in Shanghai, Chen Zizhan, said to Sun Dayu: "They want to chop off your head, Sun Dayu, and I, Chen Zizhan, will stick my head out first." (See People's Daily, August 22nd, second edition). It seems this Chen Zizhan's head has two special functions: first, it can't be chopped off or it doesn't matter if it is; second, it can avert disaster for other people's heads. Actually, this is just boasting. Its purpose is nothing more than to "encourage the dying," attempting to make his "comrades" use this encouragement to "stand up straight" and persevere. To say something that spoils the fun, if they really were going to chop off Sun Dayu's head (as long as Sun Dayu dares to do something worth chopping off his head for), Chen Zizhan may not be willing to stick his head out first. Even if he did stick it out first (if Chen Zizhan dared to do something worth chopping off his head for) and it was chopped off, I'm afraid he wouldn't even be able to see when it was Sun Dayu's turn to have his head chopped off. I advise Sun Dayu and all rightists not to do things that deserve to have their heads chopped off. Otherwise, it will be too late to regret.

　　We can talk about whether rightists' heads can be chopped off or not. It seems our constitution does not stipulate that rightists have any special privileges to avoid death. As long as they commit unforgivable crimes, it would be difficult to appease public anger if we didn’t "chop off their heads."

　　Rightists are already the objects of our dictatorship. Some of them have already committed crimes. Our struggle against rightists mainly uses debate. As long as they haven't done anything that violates criminal law, we mainly do not punish them by law. This is not because we are weak, nor is it because rightists are particularly lovable. Rather: first, we are confident that our strength is already so great that as long as right and wrong are clarified and conspiracies are exposed, even without arrest and detention, rightists will not be able to cause great rebellion in front of us; if anyone dares to take action, it will be as easy as turning one's hand to deal with them. Second, we are confident that after struggle and criticism, some rightists can lower their heads, admit their guilt, undergo a transformation, and still be transformed into a part of the people. Prioritizing reasoning over legal action is precisely to facilitate more rightists to save themselves and be saved. They must never think that this is something they can take advantage of to mislead themselves.

　　As the saying goes: "Those who commit their own sins cannot live." If the crime is unforgivable, what if someone sticks their head out first? It is beneficial to say less big words and think more about the future.

　　把“头先伸出来”便怎么？
　　侠人
    上海的一个右派分子陈子展对孙大雨说：“他们要砍你孙大雨的头，我陈子展的头先伸出来。”（见人民日报8月22日二版）好像这位陈子展的头生就有两种特殊功能：一、砍不动或砍了也不妨事；二、能为别人的头消灾免难。其实这是说大话。其目的不过是“替死人打气”，企图使他的“同志”借这股气“挺起脊梁”来，支撑下去。说句煞风景的话吧，如果真的要砍孙大雨的头（只要孙大雨敢于作出值得砍头的事来），陈子展未必肯把头先伸出来。即使先伸出来（如果陈子展敢于作出值得砍头的事来），被砍掉了，恐怕轮到砍孙大雨头的时候，他连看也看不见了。我倒奉劝孙大雨以及一切右派分子不要去干挨砍头的事好。否则是会后悔莫及的。
    可以顺便谈谈右派分子的头砍得砍不得。好像我们的宪法并没有规定右派分子有什么免死的特权。只要他们罪犯不赦之条，不“砍头”怕也难平公愤。
    右派分子们已是我们专政的对象。其中有的人已犯有罪行。我们对待右派分子的斗争，主要用辩论的方法，只要他没做触犯刑律的事，主要不是绳之以法，这并不是我们软弱，也不是右派分子有什么特别可爱惜之处。而是：一，我们自信自己的力量已如此强大，只要是非辨明了，阴谋揭穿了，即使不加捕押，右派分子也无能在我们面前大造其反；倘有人敢于动手动脚，收拾起来也易如反掌。二，我们自信经过斗争、批判，右派中有些人是可低头认罪，作一番脱胎换骨，还可转化为人民的一分子的。先辩理而不先施法，正是为了便于有更多的右派分子自救和得救。他们绝不要认为这是可欺而自误。
    古语云：“自作孽不可活。”倘罪在不赦，有人把头先伸出来便怎么？少说点大话，多想想前途是有益的。
