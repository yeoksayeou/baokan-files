Counterattack Against Right-Wing Elements in Religious Circles
Tianjin Daily August 6th Editorial

The Tianjin Daily published an editorial on August 6th entitled "Counterattack Against Right-Wing Elements in Religious Circles." The following is a summary:

During the Great Blooming and Contending, bourgeois right-wing elements in Tianjin's religious circles also took the opportunity of helping the Communist Party to rectify its work style to launch attacks against the Party and the people. They viciously attacked the Party and the government's religious policies, stubbornly claiming that there was no freedom of religious belief in our country; they slandered the "Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries" and "Elimination of Counter-Revolutionaries" movements, and cried out for justice for those counter-revolutionaries who, cloaked in religious garb, carried out counter-revolutionary activities. For example, Nie Guoping, a right-wing element in the Catholic Church and a member of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, openly clamored: "In the anti-imperialist struggle in the early days of liberation, some local policies had unclear boundaries and hurt the feelings and self-esteem of many devout believers." Some right-wing elements even blatantly wanted to overturn the verdicts on the "Catholic Youth Patriotic Corps," which had used religion to engage in espionage activities, and the "Legion of Mary," an accomplice of imperialism. All of this is absolutely intolerable to all of our people.

As everyone knows, citizens of the People's Republic of China have freedom of religious belief. This is clearly stipulated in our country's Constitution and has been resolutely implemented by the Party and the government. Since liberation, like the rest of the country, any legitimate religious activities in Tianjin have been protected, and their religious customs have also been respected. In order to implement religious policies, religious representatives are included in our people's congresses and political consultative conferences at all levels.

The issue of religious belief is an ideological issue and a matter of the spiritual world for the people, and therefore cannot be handled with simple methods. Chairman Mao explicitly pointed out in his speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "We cannot eliminate religion by administrative order, we cannot force people not to believe in religion, we cannot force people to abandon idealism, nor can we force people to believe in Marxism." However, all religious activities must be premised on not endangering the interests of the country and the people. We protect freedom of religious belief, but we will never allow counter-revolutionaries the freedom to use religious organizations to carry out destructive activities.

### 反击宗教界的右派分子  天津日报8月6日社论

    反击宗教界的右派分子
    天津日报8月6日社论
    天津日报8月6日以“反击宗教界的右派分子”为题发表社论。内容摘要如下：
    在大鸣大放中，天津市宗教界的资产阶级右派分子，也借口帮助共产党整风，向党和人民发动了进攻。他们恶毒地攻击党和政府的宗教政策，硬说在我们国家里没有宗教信仰自由；他们诬蔑“镇反”和“肃反”运动，替那些披着宗教外衣、进行反革命活动的反革命分子喊冤叫屈。如天主教中的右派分子、民盟天津市委委员聂国屏就公开叫嚣：“在解放初期的反帝斗争中，有些地方政策界限不明，伤害了很多虔诚教徒的感情和自尊心”。有的右派分子甚至明目张胆地要替曾经利用宗教进行特务活动的“公教青年报国团”和帝国主义的帮凶“圣母军”等翻案。这些，我们全体人民是决不能容许的。
    大家知道，中华人民共和国公民有宗教信仰的自由，这是在我国宪法中作了明文规定，并且为党和政府坚决贯彻执行了的。解放以后，天津市和全国一样，任何宗教的正当的宗教活动都受到保障，他们的宗教习惯也受到了尊重。为了贯彻执行宗教政策，在我们的各级人民代表大会和政治协商会议中，都有宗教界的代表。
    宗教信仰的问题，乃是人民内部的思想问题、精神世界的问题，因而也就不能用简单的方法去处理。毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲演中明确指出：“我们不能用行政命令去消灭宗教，不能强制人们不信教。不能强制人们放弃唯心主义，也不能强制人们相信马克思主义。”但是，一切宗教活动，都必须以不危害国家与人民的利益为前提。我们保护宗教信仰自由，但决不容许反革命分子有利用宗教组织来进行破坏活动的自由。
