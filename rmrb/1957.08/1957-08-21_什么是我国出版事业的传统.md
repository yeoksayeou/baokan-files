One of the tactics used by bourgeois right-wingers to attack the people's publishing industry is to disguise themselves as defenders of publishing traditions. The right-wing element Zeng Yansheng clamored that "the past experience of publishing work seems to have been completely abandoned" and that "the entire system of editing, printing, and publishing in our country has been thoroughly destroyed." Right-wing elements such as Xiao Qian and Zhang Yousong, on the other hand, tried their best to sing praises of the publishers of old China, saying that the publishers at that time "respected the authors very much" and were "meticulous." In their view, today's publishing houses are "extraordinarily careless and arrogant," "indifferent to the rights and interests of authors," have a "bureaucratic style and privileged thinking," and are "busy all day long, working hard but deserving blame." In short, in the eyes of these right-wing elements, publishing work is "not as good as before." Therefore, they all clamor to restore the so-called tradition of publishing, but they are vague about what the tradition of China's publishing industry is and have not explained it clearly. Their ulterior motive is nothing more than to use the banner of inheriting tradition to peddle their private goods of restoring the capitalist road.

In order to expose the conspiracy of the right-wing elements and prevent some people from being blinded by their flying sand and walking stones, it is necessary to analyze what the tradition of China's publishing industry is, what attitude we should take towards these traditions, and whether all traditions have been completely abandoned since liberation.

Although modern publishing and journalism are not exactly the same, in essence, they are both tools of class struggle. Revolutionary and progressive publishing industries consciously serve revolutionary and progressive social forces and groups; reactionary and backward publishing industries always serve reactionary and backward social forces and groups. Some intermediate publishing industries vacillate between the two. Therefore, there is no abstract and general so-called tradition. To study the tradition of the publishing industry, we must first clearly distinguish between the revolutionary and progressive and the reactionary and backward aspects.

The revolutionary and progressive publishing tradition is first manifested in the direction and content of publishing books. Their primary responsibility is to publicize revolutionary theories and progressive ideas, and to encourage the people to wage a resolute struggle against the reactionaries; at the same time, they also pay attention to introducing foreign advanced academic ideas, scientific achievements, and progressive culture, and to preserve and disseminate the excellent cultural heritage of the motherland. This revolutionary and progressive publishing tradition, from the old democratic revolution period in the late Qing Dynasty, in 1895, Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao once used the Qiangxue Bookstore to publish books and periodicals, publicizing the reformist ideas that were progressive at the time; later, there were the publication of Zou Rong's "Revolutionary Army" and Chen Tianhua's "Sudden Awakening," advocating national revolution and democratic revolution, which played a great progressive role at the time. After the May Fourth Movement, especially after the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, the revolutionary and progressive publishing industry took on a new look and began to take publishing Marxist works to spread socialist ideas as its important task. The "Cultural Bookstore" founded by Chairman Mao in Changsha set a brilliant example for this new type of revolutionary publishing industry. As early as 1921 and 1922, the Party directly established the "People's Publishing House" in Shanghai and Guangzhou successively, publishing classic works such as "The Communist Manifesto" and "Wage Labor and Capital." On the other hand, revolutionary intellectuals, under the leadership or influence of the Party, also ran some progressive bookstores and published a number of Marxist works and progressive literary works. During the difficult years after the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, whether in the revolutionary base areas or in the White areas, revolutionary and progressive publishing workers still held high the battle flag, publishing more books publicizing Marxism, and paying great attention to the popularization of revolutionary theory, encouraging the will of the broad masses of people's revolutionary struggle. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, thanks to the direct leadership of the Party and the state over the publishing industry, the above-mentioned combat tradition of the publishing industry has not only been inherited but also greatly developed. In the past few years, the large-scale publication of Marxist classic works, academic works with socialist ideas, popular reading materials, and progressive literary works has become the mainstream of publications. These well-known facts are not enough to fully refute the right-wing elements' nonsense about destroying traditions!

The reactionary ruling class of old China has always used publishing work to publicize their reactionary propositions. Chiang Kai-shek's "China's Destiny" is a notorious example. At that time, many backward private publishers, proceeding from the profit-seeking class nature, published a large number of low-level, boring novels and yellow books such as "Love Field Hunting Notes" to help the reactionary ruling class poison the minds of the people. After liberation, through the rectification and transformation of the private publishing industry, the publication of such reactionary and yellow books was stopped, and measures were taken to eliminate these toxins left over from old China. The complete destruction of these reactionary and backward so-called "traditions" has been warmly supported by the people of the whole country.

We believe that the direction and content of publishing books is the main aspect of publishing tradition. If we abandon this point and talk about tradition, it is putting the cart before the horse or deliberately distorting it.

Secondly, the revolutionary and progressive publishing industry serves the interests of the people. In the long-term tempering of revolutionary struggle, they have cultivated a fine tradition of hard work, simplicity, and diligent service to the people. The publishing workers in the liberated areas persisted in carrying out publishing work under extremely difficult material conditions, and many comrades contributed their precious lives in the heroic struggle. The progressive publishing workers in the White areas also have a good tradition of serving the people, and Comrade Zou Taofen is one of the representatives. This excellent tradition in publishing work has also been inherited and carried forward after liberation. Today, in factories, rural areas, and on the front lines of coastal defense, we can see the mobile supply teams of Xinhua Bookstore everywhere, which is proof. Today, the relationship between publishing houses and writers is also good in terms of basic situation. Publishing houses take the initiative to carry out soliciting activities, and many publishing houses pay close attention to the manuscripts of workers, peasants, and young authors, so that their manuscripts have the opportunity to be published. Is this something that old publishers could do? Judging from many facts, today's publishing houses are by no means the "boundless indifference" and "indifference to the rights and interests of translators" slandered by people like Zhang Yousong and Xiao Qian. On the contrary, boundless indifference and indifference to the rights and interests of translators were the original features of the reactionary bookstores and many backward private publishers in old China. Because they only serve their masters and their own wallets, they regard the spiritual labor of writers as commodities and treat writers as employees and objects of exploitation. Zhang Yousong, who used to be the owner of a private bookstore, cannot be unaware of this. This capitalist style of seeking profit and harming others, these reactionary and backward so-called traditions, have indeed been "completely abandoned" after liberation and will never return.

Thirdly, revolutionary and progressive publishing workers have always been serious and rigorous about the editing, proofreading, and publishing process of manuscripts. Mr. Lu Xun set a brilliant example for us in this regard. The serious and rigorous spirit of those excellent books such as "Overseas Jungle," "Jade Guide Collection," and "Hundred Pictures of Dead Souls" that he personally edited, proofread, and designed still deeply moves people today. After liberation, this excellent tradition has also been inherited. In the past few years, the books published have generally been more serious than the private publishing industry in old China in terms of proofreading and design. For example, "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and the new edition of "Complete Works of Lu Xun" are both of high level in proofreading and design. The manuscript of Lu Xun's "Ji Kang Collection" published last year can also be called a good work in inheriting the national form of binding and design. Although there are still some shortcomings in the design quality of books at present, it is by no means the "extraordinary carelessness" slandered by people like Xiao Qian. On the contrary, extraordinary carelessness and shoddy work are the traditional characteristics of reactionary bookstores and many backward private publishers in the old society. At that time, many shoddy and discounted punctuation books were deeply harmed and vividly remembered by many older readers. It is interesting that Shi Zhecun, a right-wing element who is now vigorously attacking the people's publishing industry in Shanghai for being "not as good as before," also wrote a lot of shoddy things himself before liberation and was denounced by Mr. Lu Xun as a "foreigner young master." After liberation, that kind of bad style of making shoddy books to deceive people quickly disappeared.

In China's modern publishing industry, there are also many intermediate publishing houses. In terms of their economic form, they belong to capitalism. However, some of the main members of some publishing houses are intellectuals with patriotic ideas, or their hosts regard the publishing house as a cultural undertaking and take a relatively serious and earnest attitude. Therefore, they have also published many good books that are beneficial to the people, which have made certain contributions to promoting China's academic research, enriching the cultural life of the Chinese people, and preserving and disseminating China's cultural heritage. We should inherit these books as the labor achievements of our predecessors and reprint them successively if they can be reprinted. In fact, many have already been reprinted in the past few years. The right-wing elements' claim of "completely destroying" is simply confusing black and white. As for the set of systems and institutions for capitalist operation, it should be said that in basic aspects, it is not suitable for the socialist publishing industry, but we have also adopted some reasonable organizational forms and administrative systems, such as some useful experiences in editing, proofreading, and binding design. Of course, we have not absorbed enough in these aspects, and there are shortcomings. However, we believe that these are not the main aspects of the tradition problem, especially the organizational form and administrative system, which basically need to develop and change with the needs of the nature and task of the publishing industry. How can it be said that today's publishing houses have not copied certain organizational forms and administrative systems of past publishing houses, which is "completely destroying the set of systems of editing, printing, and publishing in our country."

Based on the above analysis, we believe that although there are still many shortcomings in inheriting the tradition of China's publishing industry at present, which need to be further studied and improved, we have done the right thing in the basic direction, which cannot be denied by any right-wing element. The reason why the right-wing elements are making a fuss about the tradition problem is obviously with ulterior motives. Hu Ming said: "The handling of private publishing houses after liberation was a bit rough, which is a manifestation of sectarianism." Lan Yu believes that "we should open a gap and let some private publishing houses operate." The words of Hu Ming and Lan Yu revealed the truth of the right-wing elements. They are nothing more than using the excuse of preserving the so-called tradition to oppose the socialist transformation of the private publishing industry; they want to abolish the role of the publishing industry as a tool of revolutionary struggle; abolish the publishing industry's combat task of publicizing Marxism-Leninism and serving socialist construction; and abolish the leadership of the Party and the state over the publishing industry. In a word, they do not want to take the socialist road, but want to drag the publishing industry back to the old road of capitalism.

　　什么是我国出版事业的传统
    倪子明　王城　王仿子
    资产阶级右派分子向人民出版事业进攻的手法之一，就是把自己装扮成出版传统的保卫者。右派分子曾彦修叫嚷说：“对过去出版工作经验好像一古脑儿抛弃了”，“把我国所有编辑、印刷、出版的一套制度彻底打垮”了。右派分子萧乾、张友松等，则尽量对旧中国的出版商唱赞美歌，说那时的出版商“非常尊敬作者”，“一丝不苟”。而今天的出版社在他们看来，则是“出奇的马虎、踞傲”，“对著作人的权益漠不关心”，是“老爷作风，特权思想”，是“终日瞎忙，劳而有罪”。总之，在这些右派分子看来，出版工作是“今不如昔”。因此，他们就异口同声地叫嚷着要恢复所谓出版的传统，而究竟什么是我国出版事业的传统呢？他们却含糊其词，没有讲出个所以然来。他们的弦外之音，无非是借着继承传统的招牌，贩运他们恢复资本主义道路的私货罢了。
    为了揭穿右派分子的阴谋，免得有些人被他们的飞沙走石迷了眼，有必要分析一下，到底什么是我国出版事业的传统，我们应该用什么态度来对待这些传统，解放后是不是把所有传统一古脑儿抛弃了？
    近代出版事业和新闻事业虽然不完全相同，但在本质上说，都是阶级斗争的工具。革命的进步的出版事业，他们自觉地为革命的进步的社会势力和集团服务；反动的落后的出版业，他们总是为反动的落后的社会势力和集团服务。有些中间性质的出版业，则动摇于两者之间。因此，没有什么抽象的笼统的所谓传统，要研究出版事业传统，首先就要明确区分革命的进步的和反动的落后的两个方面。
    革命的进步的出版传统，首先表现在出书的方向和内容上。他们以宣传革命理论和进步思想，鼓舞人民群众向反动派进行坚决的斗争为自己的首要职责；同时，他们也注意介绍外国先进的学术思想、科学成就和进步文化，保存和传播祖国优秀的文化遗产。这种革命的进步的出版传统，从清朝末年旧民主主义革命时期起，1895年康有为、梁启超就曾经利用强学书局出版书刊，宣传在当时具有进步意义的维新思想；其后又有邹容的“革命军”，陈天华的“猛回头”等书出版，鼓吹民族革命和民主革命，在当时起了很大进步作用。“五四”以后，特别是中国共产党成立以后，革命的进步的出版事业出现了新的面貌，开始以出版马克思主义著作传播社会主义思想为自己的重要任务。毛主席在长沙创立的“文化书社”，为这种新型的革命出版事业留下了光辉的榜样。早在1921年和1922年，党就直接在上海和广州先后成立了“人民出版社”，出版了如“共产党宣言”、“工钱劳动与资本”等经典著作。另一方面，革命的知识分子，在党的领导下或影响下，也办了一些进步书店，出版了不少马克思主义著作和进步的文学作品。在第二次国内革命战争以后的艰苦年代中，不管在革命的根据地或是在白区，革命的进步的出版工作者，依然举起战斗的旗帜，出版了更多的宣传马克思主义的书籍，并且十分注意革命理论的通俗宣传，鼓舞了广大人民革命斗争的意志。中华人民共和国成立后，由于党和国家直接来领导出版事业，上述的出版事业的战斗传统，不仅继承下来而且大大地发扬光大了。几年以来，马克思主义经典著作的大量出版，具有社会主义思想的学术著作、通俗读物和进步文学作品，成为出版物的主流。这些人所共知的事实，难道不就足以充分驳倒右派分子所谓打垮了传统的胡说吗！
    旧中国的反动统治阶级，历来也是利用出版工作来宣传他们的反动主张。蒋介石的“中国之命运”，就是臭名昭著的例子。当时许多落后的私营出版商，从唯利是图的阶级本性出发，大量出版了低级趣味的无聊小说和“情场猎艳记”之类的黄色书刊，帮助反动统治阶级毒害人民的心灵。解放后，经过对私营出版业的整顿和改造，这类反动的黄色的书刊停止了出版，并且采取措施清除了旧中国遗留下来的这些毒素。把这些反动的落后的所谓“传统”彻底打垮，是得到全国人民热烈拥护的。
    我们认为出书的方向和内容，是出版传统的主要方面，如果丢掉这一点而侈谈什么传统，那就是本末倒置或者是有意歪曲。
    其次，革命的进步的出版事业，是为人民群众的利益服务的。他们在长期革命斗争的锻炼中，培养出一种艰苦朴素勤勤恳恳地为人民服务的优良传统。解放区的出版工作者，在极端困难的物质条件下，坚持不渝地进行出版工作，不少同志在英勇的斗争中贡献出他们宝贵的生命。在白区的进步出版工作者，也有为人民服务的好传统，邹韬奋同志就是其中的一个代表人物。出版工作这方面的优良传统，解放后也是继承下来加以发扬光大的，今天在工厂农村，海防前线，到处都可以看到新华书店的流动供应队伍，就是明证。今天出版社和作家之间的关系，就基本情况看，也是好的。各出版社主动进行组稿活动，许多出版社十分注意工、农、青年作者的书稿，使他们的书稿得到出版的机会，这难道是旧出版商所能做到的吗？从许多事实看来，今天的出版社决不是如张友松、萧乾之流所诬蔑的“无边的冷漠”，“对著译人的权益漠不关心”，相反，无边的冷漠，对著译人的权益漠不关心，倒是旧中国的反动书店和许多落后的私营出版商的本来面貌。因为他们只是为自己的主子和自己的钱袋服务，他们把作家的精神劳动当作商品，把作家当作受雇者和剥削的对象。这一点，曾经当过私营书店老板的张友松是不会不知道的。资产阶级这种唯利是图、损人利己的作风，这些反动落后的所谓传统，在解放以后，的确是“彻底抛弃”，而且一去不复返了。
    再其次，革命的进步的出版工作者，对书稿的编辑校勘和出版过程，从来是认真严肃的。鲁迅先生在这方面给我们留下了光辉的榜样，他所亲自编校设计的“海上述林”、“引玉集”、“死魂灵百图”这些出色的书籍，那种严肃认真的精神，到今天还叫人深深感动。解放后，这方面的优良传统也是继承下来了的。这几年出版的书籍，在校勘设计上，一般说比旧中国的私营出版业要认真得多。如“毛泽东选集”、新版“鲁迅全集”，都是在校勘设计上具有很高水平的。去年出版的鲁迅的手稿“稽康集”，在继承装帧设计的民族形式上也堪称佳制。目前在书籍的设计质量上虽还存在一些缺点，但决不是如萧乾之流所诬蔑的“出奇的马虎”。相反，出奇的马虎，粗制滥造，正是旧社会反动书店和许多落后的私营出版商的传统特色。当时那许多粗制滥造、一折八扣的标点书，现在许多年纪大些的读者，是身受其害、记忆犹新的。有趣的是，现在在上海大肆攻击人民出版事业“今不如昔”的右派分子施蛰存，他自己在解放前也就编写了不少粗制滥造的东西，曾被鲁迅先生指斥为“洋场恶少”。解放以后，那种对书籍出版粗制滥造借以骗人的恶劣作风，很快就绝迹了。
    在我国近代出版事业中，也还有许多中间性质的出版社，他们就其经济形态来说是属于资本主义的。但其中有些出版社的主要组成人员是具有爱国主义思想的知识分子，或者他们的主持人把出版社当作文化事业来办，态度比较严肃认真。因此，他们也出版了不少有益于人民的好书，对于推动我国学术研究工作，丰富我国人民的文化生活，保存和传播我国文化遗产，都有一定的贡献。这些书籍，我们应该把它当作前人的劳动成果继承下来，整理其中可以重印的陆续重印。事实上这几年也已经重印不少，右派分子所说的“一概打垮”，简直是混淆黑白。至于资本主义经营的一套体制和制度，应该说在基本方面并不适合社会主义出版事业，但我们对其中某些合理的组织形式和办事制度，如某些编辑、校勘和装帧设计方面的有益经验，也是采用了的，当然在这些方面我们还吸取得不够，是有缺点的。但是，我们认为这些并不是传统问题的主要方面，特别是组织形式和办事制度，基本上要随着出版事业性质任务的需要而发展变化的。怎末可以胡说今天的出版社没有照搬过去出版社的某些组织形式和办事制度，就算“把我国编辑、印刷、出版的一套制度彻底打垮”了呢。
    根据以上的分析，我们认为，目前在继承我国出版事业传统的问题上，虽然还有不少缺点，有待于进一步研究改进，但在基本方向上是作对了的，这是任何右派分子所抹煞不了的。右派分子之所以在传统问题上做文章，显然是别有用心的。胡明说：“解放后对私人出版社的处理有些粗暴，这是宗派主义的表现”。蓝钰认为：“要开一个口子，让搞一些私营出版社”。胡明和蓝钰的话，说出了右派分子的真情。他们无非是借口保存所谓传统，来反对私营出版业的社会主义改造；他们是要取消出版事业作为革命斗争工具的作用；取消出版事业宣传马克思列宁主义，为社会主义建设服务的战斗任务；取消党和国家对出版事业的领导。总之一句话，他们就是不要走社会主义的道路，而要把出版事业拖回到资本主义的老路上去。
