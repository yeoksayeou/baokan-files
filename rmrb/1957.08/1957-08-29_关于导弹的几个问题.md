　　Several Questions About Missiles
    Q: What is a missile? How does a missile fly? What types of missiles are there?
    A: A missile can also be called a guided missile, referring to a missile with a guidance system. It is an automatic flying device that can be guided to its target by external forces or by instruments built into it. Because it is unmanned, it can fly into the atmosphere, into space beyond the atmosphere, and even underwater. A missile consists of two parts: a rocket (including the guidance system) and a warhead (which can be equipped with an atomic or hydrogen bomb).
    Missiles can be divided into the following four categories based on their flight control methods:
    The first category includes missiles whose control instruments are all installed inside the missile body. Their flight does not rely on the control of any instruments outside the missile. They fly automatically according to a predetermined direction, speed, and altitude. During flight, these missiles will also automatically correct their own position.
    The second category includes missiles equipped with radio-controlled components, where radio waves sent from outside control the missile's flight.
    The third category includes missiles that automatically align themselves with targets based on different characteristics of the targets, such as the heat or sound emitted by airplanes, ships, or factories, or the radio waves emitted by radio stations.
    The fourth category includes missiles that utilize two or three of the above methods simultaneously to guide their flight.
    Based on the missile's purpose and usage, missiles can also be roughly divided into the following four categories: surface-to-surface, surface-to-air, air-to-air, and air-to-surface.
    Surface-to-surface missiles are launched from the ground or ships and used to attack targets on the ground or on the water.
    Surface-to-air missiles can also be called anti-aircraft missiles. These missiles are launched from the ground or ships and used as anti-aircraft weapons to attack aerial targets.
    Air-to-air missiles are carried and launched by aircraft. They can automatically search for targets in the sky and shoot down enemy aircraft or missiles.
    Air-to-surface missiles are missiles used by bombers. These missiles can be controlled by radio to fly and can automatically search for bombing targets on the ground or on the water. Some can even track submarines underwater.
    Generally, the flight speed of a missile can exceed the speed of sound by three or four times, or even more. The flight altitude can reach tens or hundreds of kilometers.
    According to the distance a missile can fly, missiles can also be divided into short-range, medium-range, and long-range.
    Q: What is the current situation of missile development in various countries around the world?
    A: In addition to the Soviet Union, the United States and Britain have also developed missiles. For the purpose of aggression, the United States invited rocket experts from fascist Germany to conduct research as early as the end of World War II. So far, the US government has spent six billion US dollars to develop missiles. Although the United States has developed some missiles, it has not yet successfully launched an intercontinental missile. In mid-June of this year, the United States tested the launch of an "Atlas" intercontinental missile, but it exploded due to mechanical failure immediately after launch. A spokesman for the US Department of Defense said in March of this year that the US medium-range ballistic missile would need a year or more to reach the "operational phase." At that time, the only short-range "Corporal" missile equipped to its army had a maximum range of only one hundred miles. The current US "Matador" missile has a longer range, but it is only over eight hundred kilometers.
    Q: What are the characteristics of the rocket successfully tested by the Soviet Union this time?
    A: The Soviet Union launched an ultra-long-range, multi-stage, intercontinental ballistic rocket this time.
    The range of missiles varies. Some can only shoot within one hundred kilometers, and some can be launched to nine hundred kilometers. The farthest can reach several thousand or even ten thousand kilometers, and can be launched from one continent to another, so it is called an intercontinental missile. The rocket successfully tested by the Soviet Union this time is a type of ultra-long-range intercontinental missile. It was not carrying a warhead during the test, so it is called a rocket. The flight path of this rocket is parabolic, so it is called a ballistic rocket. In addition, because of the extremely long range, this rocket is multi-staged. After it is launched, when the fuel in the first stage rocket is used up and it reaches the required speed, the shell of the first stage will automatically detach from the rocket, and the second stage engine will continue to push the rocket forward.
    From this, it can be seen that the rocket successfully tested by the Soviet Union this time is the most advanced missile in the world today. If equipped with a nuclear warhead, it can be launched to any target in the world in a few minutes, and it is indefensible. Even Western news agencies have to admit that this Soviet missile is the "ultimate" weapon and the "ultimate goal" that Western scientists are striving for. This once again proves the advanced nature and superiority of Soviet science and technology.
    The Soviet Union is a peace-loving country and has always adhered to the prohibition of atomic and nuclear weapons. The Soviet Union's purpose in testing intercontinental missiles is only to defend world peace and national security. Therefore, it is a blessing for world peace that this powerful weapon is in the hands of the peace-loving Soviet Union.

　　关于导弹的几个问题
    问：什么是导弹？导弹是怎样飞行的？导弹有哪几种？
    答：导弹又可以说是定向飞弹，是指一种有导向装置的飞弹。它是一种自动飞行装置，可以由这个装置之外的操纵力或由建造在它里面的工具导向目标。由于它是无人驾驶的，所以它可以飞进大气里，飞进大气外的空间，甚至在海底飞行。导弹由两部分构成，一部分是火箭（包括导向装置）一部分是弹头（可以装置原子弹或氢弹）。
    根据导弹飞行控制方式的不同可以把它分成下列四类：
    第一类是导弹的控制仪器全部装在弹体内，它们的飞行不依靠导弹以外任何仪器的控制，完全按照预先定好的方向、速度、高度而自动飞行的。在飞行途中，这种导弹也会自动地矫正本身的飞行位置。
    第二类是在导弹上安装着无线电操纵的机件，由外面送入的电波来控制导弹飞行的。
    第三类是根据目标的不同特征，例如利用飞机、船只、工厂发出来的热或声音以及由无线电台发射出来的电波等等使导弹自动对准目标而飞行的。
    第四类是同时利用以上两、三种方式而指挥导弹的飞行的。
    根据导弹的用途和使用方法的不同，导弹也可以大致分成下面的四类：即地对地类，地对空类，空对空类和空对地类四种。
    地对地类导弹是从地面或舰艇上发射，用来攻击地面或水上目标用的。
    地对空类导弹也可以称为防空导弹，这种导弹是从地面上或舰艇上发射出来，用来攻击空中目标的防空武器。
    空对空类导弹是由飞机携带和发射的，它能在天空中自动寻找目标把敌机或导弹打下来。
    空对地类导弹是轰炸机用的导弹，这种导弹可以由无线电操纵飞行并能自动寻找地面或水面上的轰炸目标，有的还能在水下追踪潜水艇。
    一般导弹的飞行速度可以超过音速的三、四倍以至更多些。飞行高度也可以达到几十、几百公里。
    按照导弹飞行的远近，导弹又可以分为短程、中程和远程多种。
    问：目前世界各国试制导弹的情况如何？
    答：除了苏联以外，美国和英国等也已经制成了导弹。美国为了侵略目的，早在第二次世界大战结束时，就把德国法西斯的火箭专家请去研究。到目前为止，美国政府为了发展导弹而花去的钱已达六十亿美元，美国虽然制成了一些导弹，但是迄今为止还没有发射成功洲际导弹。在今年6月中旬美国曾试验发射一枚“阿特拉斯”式洲际导弹，但刚发射出去就因机件失灵而炸毁了。美国国防部发言人今年3月间曾说，美国的中程弹道导弹还需要一年或更多的时间才能达到“使用阶段”。当时美国配备给它的军队的只是一种短程的“下士式”导弹，最远射程仅有一百英里。目前美国的
  “斗牛士式”导弹射程较远，但也只有八百多公里。
    问：这次苏联试验成功的火箭有什么特点？
    答：苏联这次发射的是一枚超远程的、多级的、洲际弹道火箭。
    导弹的射程远近不同，有的只能射一百公里以内，有的可以发射到九百公里。最远的可以达到几千公里以至万公里，可以从一个洲发射到另一个洲去，因而叫洲际导弹。苏联这次试验成功的火箭就是超远程的洲际导弹的一种。试验时没有带弹头。所以叫做火箭。这种火箭飞行的途径成抛物线形状，所以叫它弹道火箭。此外，由于射程极远，所以这枚火箭是多级的。当它发射出去以后，等到第一级火箭的燃料烧完，而且达到它所需要的速度时，第一级的壳体就会和火箭自动脱离，而第二级的发动机又继续把火箭推向前进。
    由此可见，苏联这次试验成功的火箭，是目前世界上最先进的导弹。如果装上核弹头之后，它可以在几分钟内射到世界上的任何目标，而且是不能防御的。连西方通讯社也不得不承认苏联这种导弹是“最后的”武器，是西方科学家致力以求的“最终目标”。这就又一次证明了苏联科学技术的先进性和优越性。
    苏联是爱好和平的国家，它一贯坚持禁止原子武器和核武器。苏联试验洲际导弹的目的，只是为了保卫世界和平和国家的安全。因此，这种强大的武器掌握在爱好和平的苏联手中，是世界和平的福音。
