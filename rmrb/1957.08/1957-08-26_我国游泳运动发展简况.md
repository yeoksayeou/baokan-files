A Brief Overview of the Development of Swimming in China

　　Before liberation, swimming, like other sports, was restricted by sports venues, funding, and old social ideologies under the rule of the reactionaries, and could not be developed. Until liberation, the national records for most swimming events were still those created in 1936.

　　After liberation, thanks to the attention of the Party and the government, and with the vigorous development of China's sports, swimming has also made great progress.

　　According to incomplete statistics, since liberation, more than 70 new swimming pools and swimming halls, and more than 40 natural swimming areas have been built across the country. The Beijing Gymnasium Swimming Hall and Taoranting Swimming Pool, built in 1955, are not only among the best in China but also first-class in the world in terms of scale. These swimming facilities have created favorable material conditions for the masses to engage in swimming.

　　With the expansion of swimming facilities, mass swimming activities have gradually developed. The number of people who go to the new swimming facilities to swim every day is increasing. Take Tianjin as an example, as shown in the table below:
　　　　1952 (Summer) 110,000 person-times
　　　　1953 (Summer) 180,000 person-times
　　　　1954 (Summer) 310,000 person-times
　　　　1955 (Summer) 440,000 person-times

　　The number of participants in Tianjin is still relatively small. In Guangzhou, more than 100,000 people go to five public swimming venues every Sunday.

　　More and more people are participating in swimming competitions. The number of participants in the National Swimming Championships has been increasing year by year as follows:
　1952　7 participating units　184 athletes
　1955　17 participating units　293 athletes
　1957　21 participating units　More than 500 athletes

　　As for the swimming sports meets held by provinces and cities, there have been more than 100 since liberation, with 20,000 athletes participating. More people participate in grassroots swimming competitions. In 1954, there were 3,743 participants, and in 1956, the number reached 64,376. In the Yangtze River crossing swimming competition held in Wuhan, 2,400 people participated last year, and more than 20,000 people registered this year, with more than 5,000 people approved to participate. In dozens of places such as the Yong River in Guangxi, the Xiang River in Changsha, and the Huangpu River in Shanghai, thousands of people have plunged into river crossing competitions this year.

　　In the past few years, the level of swimming in China has rapidly improved, and records are created and updated every year. The records created in 1952 were only equivalent to the level of the current second-class athletes. The records created in 1954 reached the level of the current first-class athletes, and all pre-liberation swimming records were broken this year. In 1955, 71 more person-times broke the previous year's new records. In 1956, 88 more person-times exceeded the unprecedented records. This year, many people have already created new records.

　　In international swimming competitions, Chinese athletes often rank among the top. In 1953, Comrade Wu Chuanyu won the 100-meter backstroke champion at the World Youth Festival, winning the first gold medal for the motherland. In 1954, he won second place in the 100-meter backstroke and 100-meter butterfly at the World University Games. In 1955 and 1956, China achieved greater results. In addition to Qi Lieyun, Lin Jinzhu, Xu Zhixiang, Dai Lihua, and others being listed in the top six due to their close proximity to international standards, it is particularly worth mentioning the outstanding athlete Mu Xiangxiong: In several consecutive competitions in Europe, he won the men's 100-meter and 200-meter breaststroke championships; his 100-meter breaststroke performance has improved to 1 minute 9.6 seconds (25-meter pool), breaking the world record before 1956; his 200-meter breaststroke performance reached 2 minutes 36 seconds, second only to the world breaststroke king, Japanese athlete Furukawa. This year, Qi Lieyun broke the world record in the 100-meter breaststroke with a time of 1 minute 11.6 seconds. At the Third International Youth Friendship Games held in Moscow, Lin Jinzhu and Qi Lieyun won second place in the 100-meter freestyle and 200-meter breaststroke respectively, and Mu Xiangxiong won fifth place in the 200-meter breaststroke. Our delegation also won fifth place in the men's 800-meter freestyle relay. (Shi Yuzhong)

### 我国游泳运动发展简况

　　我国游泳运动发展简况
    解放前，游泳运动同其他项目的运动一样，在反动派的统治下，受到运动场地，经费和旧社会思想的束缚，得不到发展。直到解放前，游泳运动中绝大部分项目的全国纪录还是1936年创造的。
    解放以后，由于党和政府的重视，随着我国体育事业的蓬勃发展，游泳运动也有了很大的进步。
    据不完全统计，解放以来全国各地新修建的游泳池、游泳馆有七十多个，天然游泳场有四十多个。1955年修建的北京体育馆游泳馆和陶然亭游泳场，规模之大，不仅在我国是数一数二的，在全世界也是第一流的。这些游泳场所，为广大人民群众开展游泳运动，创造了有利的物质条件。
    随着游泳场所的扩大，群众性的游泳运动逐步开展起来了。日常到新建的游泳场所去游泳的人数与日俱增，以天津市为例，见下表：
        1952年（夏季）11万人次
        1953年（夏季）18万人次
        1954年（夏季）31万人次
        1955年（夏季）44万人次
    天津市参加的人数还是比较少的。在广州，每星期日到五个公共游泳场所去游泳的就达十万余人次。
    越来越多的人参加了游泳比赛，参加全国游泳运动大会的人数逐年增长情况如下：
  1952年　参加单位7　运动员184名
  1955年　参加单位17　运动员293名
  1957年　参加单位21　运动员500多名
    至于省市举办的游泳运动会，解放以来已有过一百多次，参加的运动员有二万人。参加基层游泳竞赛的人更多，1954年有三千七百四十三人，1956年则达到了六万四千三百七十六人。在武汉市举行的横渡长江的游泳比赛，去年有二千四百人参加，今年则有二万多人报名、五千多人得到批准参加。在广西的邕江、长沙的湘江、上海的黄浦江……等几十个地方，今年都有成千上万的人投进了渡江竞赛。
    几年来，我国游泳运动的水平迅速提高，每年创造更新纪录。1952年创造的纪录，还只相当于目前二级运动员的水平。1954年创造的纪录，就达到了目前一级运动员的水平，这年还把解放前的各项游泳纪录全部刷新。1955年，又有七十一人次打破了上年各项新纪录。1956年，更有八十八人次超过了前所未有的各项纪录。今年也已经有不少人创造了更新纪录。
    在国际性的游泳比赛中，我国运动员的成绩常常名列前矛。1953年，吴传玉同志在世界青年联欢节上获得了一百公尺仰泳冠军，为祖国取得了第一枚金质奖章。1954年，他在世界大学生运动会上又连获一百公尺仰泳和一百公尺蝶泳的第二名。1955和1956年，我国取得了更大成绩，除了戚烈云、林锦珠、徐致祥、戴丽华等因成绩接近国际水平被列为前六名外，特别值得一提的是优秀运动员穆祥雄：在欧洲连续几次比赛中，他都取得了男子一百公尺和二百公尺蛙泳冠军；他的一百公尺蛙泳的成绩已提高到1分9秒6（二十五公尺池），打破了1956年以前的世界纪录；他的二百公尺蛙泳成绩达到2分36秒，仅次于世界蛙王日本运动员古川的成绩。今年，戚烈云又以一分十一秒六的成绩打破了一百公尺蛙泳的世界纪录。在莫斯科举行的第三届国际青年友谊运动会上，林锦珠、戚烈云又分别取得了一百公尺自由泳、二百公尺蛙泳的第二名，穆祥雄取得了二百公尺蛙泳第五名，我们的代表队还取得了男子八百公尺自由泳接力第五名。　（施毓忠）
