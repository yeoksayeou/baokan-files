    Why Does Lan Yu Want to "Reform" Publishing Work?
    Zhang Jimin
      Rightist element Lan Yu (a Communist Party member), the Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the Popular Reading Materials Publishing House, launched a malicious attack on the people's publishing enterprise during the rectification campaign. He and another rightist element, Zeng Yansheng, echoed each other, portraying the entire publishing industry after liberation as completely dark. They wantonly attacked the Party's publishing policy, denied the Party's leadership over the publishing industry, negated the achievements of the past eight years of publishing work, and slandered the Party's cadre policy and the Soviet Union's experiences and systems. These two rightist elements acted like a double act, echoing each other.
      Their aim in attacking the Party was to abolish the Party's leadership over the publishing industry and drag publishing work back to the old capitalist road. This can be seen from the "reform plan" proposed by Lan Yu.
    According to Lan Yu's "plan," the first step is to "thoroughly rectify" state-owned publishing houses, getting rid of some; at the same time, opening up a free market and establishing private publishing houses. This means that the socialist road taken by the publishing work in the past few years was wrong, resulting in "unified but not smooth" and full of contradictions. Therefore, only by reviving capitalism can the contradictions be resolved. Only by opening up a free market and establishing private publishing houses can the contradictions be resolved through free competition, otherwise the contradictions will never be resolved. This also means that it is necessary to "thoroughly rectify" state-owned publishing houses, "compress a batch and merge a batch," to give the "market" to private publishing houses, so that private publishing houses can use free competition to bring down state-owned publishing houses. Isn't this kind of "suggestion" to overthrow the socialist system and establish a capitalist system exactly what those bourgeois rightist elements are pursuing day and night? Who are the people who are so-called "now putting forward new demands in society?" What are these demands? Aren't they the rightist elements clamoring against the state's "monopoly" of news and publication, and wanting to run like-minded newspapers and magazines, and like-minded publishing houses? The so-called "everything is only 'national,' and people always feel that you Communists are doing things" is not the rightist elements' clamor of "the Party's world?" The so-called "everyone should have a share" is not the rightist elements' clamor of "alternating in power?" The so-called "it is better to let others do it" is not the rightist elements' clamor of "you step down, I'll do it?" Therefore, from this "suggestion," it is not difficult for us to see what Lan Yu's intention is, and it is not difficult to see who he is appealing for and who he is supporting!
      According to Lan Yu's "plan," the second is to abolish the Party's leadership. He said that the Publishing Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Culture "cannot adapt to the situation" and "can be abolished." After the abolition, "a 'Publishing Committee' can be established under the State Council to manage two things: (1) the publishing policy; (2) the relationship between publishing houses. … It is necessary to unify the leadership of all publishing houses, but not to unify them to death, only to unify the policy and relations." Then, he said, "In addition, it is also necessary to establish a publishing association as a mass organization of the publishing industry. That is, let the publishing industry manage its own affairs." Xinhua Bookstore is also handed over to the association to manage, becoming a joint venture institution. From these "suggestions," it is not difficult to see that the establishment of a publishing committee is false, while the establishment of a publishing association is real. The problem is very obvious. Lan Yu says that he doesn't want the leadership of the Publishing Bureau, so why set up another Publishing Committee to lead? Obviously, Lan Yu's saying that he wants to establish a publishing committee is just a feint to show that he does not want the Party's leadership, but in fact he just wants the publishing industry to manage its own affairs. Because Lan Yu has already affirmed in advance that if certain things are taken to the publishing association to handle, "it is guaranteed to be done better than it is now." That is to say, letting publishers manage their own affairs is guaranteed to be better than the Party's leadership! Isn't this abolishing the Party's leadership?
    According to Lan Yu's "plan," the third is to overthrow the current system of independent responsibility for the three departments of publishing, printing, and distribution, and restore the past system of publishing, printing, and distribution as a trinity. Lan Yu said: "Now the three links of publishing, printing, and distribution are isolated. The separation of publishing and distribution has caused many contradictions and jokes." "Xinhua Bookstore now has thousands of branches and tens of thousands of employees, which is indeed difficult to change." "The essence of the contradiction is indeed in the economic relationship, and reformism cannot satisfy everyone. So can Xinhua Bookstore consider handing it over to the publishing association for leadership, so that everyone can manage the bookstore, so that the contradiction can be solved better." We do not deny that the cooperation between the three departments of publishing, printing, and distribution is not good enough at present, and there are still some shortcomings that can be overcome that have not been overcome in time. However, Lan Yu's deliberate search for faults in Xinhua Bookstore and exaggeration of the shortcomings in printing work are ulterior motives. As a publishing worker, Lan Yu cannot know that the professional division of labor in these three departments is to put the publishing industry on the track of planning, to concentrate the use of existing human and machine equipment, in order to play a greater role and complete more tasks. Lan Yu's opposition to this division of labor is to oppose planning and oppose putting publishing work into the national plan. He envies the trinity "large enterprises" of the past Commercial Press and Zhonghua Book Company. He believes that the publishing house cannot run its own factory and cannot distribute itself is "subject to others." The "freedom of publication" he demands is to restore free competition and capitalist monopoly in the publishing industry. Because the past trinity system of Commerce and China was the result of capitalist blind competition and blind development. The development of the capitalist publishing industry, like the development of other capitalist economies, is independent of each other. In order not to be subject to others, we must each engage in a set of publishing, printing, and distribution agencies. Later, everyone will become a trust. What you have, I must also have, in order to defeat the other party in the competition. Lan Yu especially praises this "economic relationship" here, completely denying the progressive role of the division of labor in the three links of publishing, printing, and distribution in the development of socialist publishing and the implementation of publishing planning. His purpose is to restore capitalist spontaneity and oppose the socialist planning system.
    From the content of the entire "plan," his main purpose is to abolish the Party's leadership, realize personal ambition, develop capitalism, and bring down socialism. If this "plan" can be implemented, we cannot imagine who it will benefit, whether it will benefit the readers, the authors, the publishing workers, or the small handful of bourgeois rightist elements in society! Therefore, we cannot but believe that Lan Yu's "reform plan" is essentially a thorough anti-Party and anti-socialist program in publishing work.

    蓝钰为什么要“改革”出版工作？
    张姞民
      右派分子、通俗读物出版社副总编辑蓝钰（共产党员）在整风期间，对人民的出版事业进行了恶意的攻击。他和另一个右派分子曾彦修一唱一和，把解放后整个出版事业说成漆黑一团。他们肆意攻击党的出版方针，否认党对出版事业的领导，否定八年来出版工作的成绩，并诬蔑党的干部政策和苏联的经验、制度。这两个右派分子像唱双簧一样，一呼一应。
      他们向党进攻的目的，就是为了取消党对出版事业的领导，把出版工作拖回到资本主义的老路。这可以从蓝钰所提出的“改革方案”看出来。
    按照蓝钰的“方案”，首先是要把国营出版社“彻底整顿”，整掉一些；同时开放自由市场，成立私营出版社。这就是说，出版工作几年来走社会主义的路走错了，结果是“统而不通”，矛盾百出，因此只有让资本主义复活。只有开放自由市场，成立私营出版社，通过自由竞争，矛盾才能解决，否则矛盾就永远解决不了。这也就是说，必须“彻底整顿”国营出版社，“压缩一批、裁并一批”，好把“市场”让给私营出版社，好让私营出版社利用自由竞争来搞垮国营出版社。这种推翻社会主义制度，建立资本主义制度的“建议”，不正是那些资产阶级右派分子所日夜追求的吗？所谓“现在社会上提出了新的要求”，是什么人提出来的？是些什么要求呢？不正是那些右派分子叫嚣反对国家对新闻出版的“垄断”，要办同人报刊，同人出版社吗？所谓“一切只有‘国家的’，人家总觉得是你们共产党员办事”，不正是右派分子所叫嚣的“党天下”吗？所谓“大家都应该有一份”，不正是右派分子所叫嚣的“轮流执政”吗？所谓“不如让别人也搞”，不正是右派分子所叫嚣的“你下台，我来干”吗？因此，从这一项“建议”中，我们不难看出蓝钰的用意何在，不难看出他是在为谁呼吁，在为谁撑腰！
      按照蓝钰的“方案”，第二是取消党的领导。他说，文化部出版事业管理局，“不能适应情况”，“可以撤销”。撤销以后，“可以在国务院之下设立一个‘出版委员会’，管两件事：（1）出版的方针政策；（2）出版社之间的关系。……要统一领导所有出版社，但又不要统死，只统方针政策和关系”。接着，他又说，“另外还要成立出版协会，作为出版界群众性的组织。也就是让出版界自己管自己的事。”新华书店也交协会管，成为联营机构。从这些“建议”中不难看出，设立出版委员会是虚，而成立出版协会是实。问题很明显，蓝钰口口声声不要出版局领导，为什么还要另外设立一个出版委员会来领导？显然，蓝钰的设立出版委员会之说，只不过是虚晃一着，以示并非不要党的领导，而实际上恰恰是要让出版界自己管自己的事。因为蓝钰已经预先肯定，某些事情如果拿到出版协会去办，“包管比现在办得好”。也就是说，让出版家们自己管自己的事，包管比党领导得好！这不是取消党的领导又是什么？
    按照蓝钰的“方案”，第三是推翻现在出版、印刷、发行三个部门独立负责的制度，恢复过去出版、印刷、发行三位一体的制度。蓝钰说：“现在出版、印刷、发行三个环节是孤立起来的。出版和发行分家，搞得矛盾百出，笑话百出。”“新华书店现在支店几千、人员上万，的确积重难返。”“矛盾的实质的确在经济关系上，改良主义也不可能让大家满意。所以新华书店可否考虑交出版协会领导，大家管书店，这样，矛盾就好解决些”。我们并不否认，目前出版、印刷和发行三个部门配合得还不够好，还有一些可以克服的缺点没有及时克服。但蓝钰处心积虑地找新华书店的毛病，夸大印刷工作中的缺点，却是别有用心的。蓝钰身为出版工作者，不能不知道这三个部门的专业分工是为了使出版事业走上计划化的轨道，是为了集中使用现有的人力和机器设备，以便发挥更大的作用，完成更多的任务。而蓝钰反对这种分工，就是为了反对计划化，反对把出版工作纳入国家计划。他羡慕过去商务印书馆、中华书局那些三位一体的“大企业”，他认为出版社不能自己搞厂、不能自己发行是“受制于人”。他所要求的“出版自由”是想恢复出版业的自由竞争和资本主义垄断。因为过去的商务、中华的三位一体制，那是资本主义盲目竞争、盲目发展的结果。资本主义出版事业的发展，也与其他资本主义经济的发展一样，是各自为政的。为了使自己不受制于人，就要各自搞一套出版、印刷、发行的机构。到后来，大家便都搞成托辣斯，你有什么我也要有什么，以便在竞争中把对方打败。蓝钰在这儿特别歌颂这种“经济关系”，完全否认出版、印刷、发行三个环节的分工在社会主义出版事业的发展上和实行出版事业计划化上的进步作用，其目的就在恢复资本主义的自发性，反对社会主义的计划制度。
    从整个“方案”的内容来看，他的主要目的就在于取消党的领导，实现个人野心，发展资本主义，搞垮社会主义。如果这个“方案”能够得到实施，我们不能想像，它是对谁有利的，是对读者有利，是对作者有利，是对出版工作者有利，还是对社会上那一小撮资产阶级右派分子有利！因此，我们不能不认为，蓝钰这个“改革方案”实质上是出版工作方面一个彻头彻尾的反党反社会主义纲领。
