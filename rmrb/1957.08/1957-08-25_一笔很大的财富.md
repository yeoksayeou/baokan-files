In today's situation of insufficient cotton and cotton cloth production, the linters on cottonseed are a great fortune for our country.

In recent years, our country has taken various measures to increase the supply of cotton cloth and improve people's lives, which should be affirmed. However, due to the continuous increase in our country's social purchasing power and the fact that cotton production cannot keep up with the raw material needs of the textile industry, although the state has taken various measures to increase the production and supply of cotton cloth, the people's needs for cotton cloth still cannot be met. In order to solve the contradiction between the insufficient production of cotton cloth in our country and the ever-increasing demand for cotton cloth from the broad masses of people, there are two fundamental solutions. One solution is to use a large amount of chemical fertilizers to increase cotton production, and the other is to vigorously develop synthetic fibers and other man-made fibers to partially replace cotton. However, it will take a considerable amount of time to adopt these two methods, and significant results cannot be achieved in the short term. From the current situation, making full use of the linters on cottonseed is one of the most convenient methods.

Our country has a large resource of linters. According to the current national cotton planting area, it is estimated that about 50 million dan of cottonseed can be produced. Among them, the state controls about 20 million dan of cottonseed through the purchase of seed cotton, and farmers process about 30 million dan of cottonseed. If all the linters on these cottonseeds can be stripped off, there would be about 3 million dan. Among them, about 1 million to 1.2 million dan can be used as wadding. The replaced cotton can spin 300,000 pieces of yarn, which can weave 12 million bolts of cloth, which is equivalent to an average increase of two chi of cloth per person in the country. The remaining 2 million dan is a good raw material for the chemical industry, which can be used domestically or exported. Therefore, making full use of the linters resource is not only of great significance for alleviating the current situation of insufficient cotton and tight supply of cotton cloth in our country, but also can increase a large income for the country.

Therefore, the State Council recently issued a special instruction requiring the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives to take various effective measures to strip off all the linters on the cottonseed controlled by the state within one or two years, and also strip off most of the linters on the cottonseed processed by cotton farmers themselves. Since the national cotton planting area in 1957 was reduced by more than 6 million mu compared to 1956, and cotton fields in some areas have also suffered from floods, stripping linters has become even more important.

From the current situation, there are the following two major issues that need to be resolved in the work of stripping linters:

The first issue is the problem of adding delinting equipment. Our country's existing delinting equipment is far from being able to undertake the above-mentioned large amount of delinting tasks. In order to solve this problem, the State Council has approved the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives to add a part on the basis of the original plan to add delinting machines in 1957. The time distance from the new cotton listed on the market is very short. All regions must make reasonable arrangements for the newly added delinting machines and install them quickly. In addition, the relevant industrial departments are required to do everything possible to supply the various machinery and power equipment required for stripping linters, and ensure that the goods are delivered to the regions and departments that need them on schedule. Other relevant departments should also support this important work.

The second issue is the issue of centralized delinting and decentralized delinting. From the perspective of increasing the production of linters, the method of the state purchasing more seed cotton and centralized delinting is better. In recent years, the seed cotton purchased by the state from farmers accounted for about 50% of the total purchase volume when converted into lint cotton. Some areas have very little, for example, Hubei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Sichuan and other provinces are only close to 20%. Therefore, in areas where the proportion of seed cotton purchases is small, the state needs to purchase more seed cotton appropriately. In other areas, the amount of seed cotton that agricultural cooperatives process themselves for engaging in sideline production should not exceed the amount of the previous year. For the stripping of linters on cottonseed scattered in the hands of farmers, three methods can also be adopted: First, the supply and marketing cooperative ginneries process and strip linters for farmers on the principle of mutual benefit. The state purchases the linters, the processing plant charges a processing fee appropriately, and the remaining cottonseed is returned to the farmers. Second, organize agricultural cooperatives to use existing animal or water-powered leather roller gins to strip the first linters, and the state purchases them. Third, the state can exchange edible oil and oil cake for farmers' cottonseed to strip linters, but the cottonseed exchanged from farmers is limited to the part retained by farmers for their own use in accordance with the unified purchase and marketing policy. It should be recognized that the more linters the state can strip, the more cotton cloth production can be increased, and the supply of cotton cloth to urban and rural people can also be increased. Doing so is beneficial to both the state and cotton farmers. Therefore, cotton farmers across the country should actively sell more seed cotton to the state so that the state can control more cottonseed for delinting.

Regarding the task of stripping linters, all regions have generally attached importance to it. Hebei, Shandong and other provinces have actively organized forces to carry out specific actions. However, some areas completely oppose the sideline production of cotton ginning by agricultural cooperatives and the national organization of agricultural cooperatives' ginning forces to cooperate in delinting, and believe that once the country is organized, it will affect the sideline income of agricultural cooperatives. This view is one-sided. At present, agricultural cooperatives own more than half of the cottonseed resources. If the ginning forces of agricultural cooperatives are not organized and equipped with corresponding delinting equipment, it will be empty talk to make full use of the linters resources. The problem is to adopt various methods suitable for local conditions. For example, organize the ginning forces of agricultural cooperatives around the cotton purchasing stations, and install delinting equipment by the supply and marketing cooperatives according to the ginning capacity, establish ginning and delinting stations, which are uniformly led by the supply and marketing cooperatives, and give reasonable remuneration to the ginning equipment and labor force of agricultural cooperatives; or the supply and marketing cooperatives install delinting machines according to the distribution of ginning equipment of agricultural cooperatives and decentralize delinting. This is beneficial to both the state and agricultural cooperatives. As long as the reason is explained clearly, the agricultural cooperatives will fully agree.

Some places suspect that the linters production plan is advancing rashly, and therefore hesitate. This is also incorrect. We believe that whether it is advancing rashly or not mainly depends on the conditions for linters production. At present, linters production resources are abundant, the country urgently needs them; the materials and funds required for delinting equipment can be fully supplied; the supply and marketing cooperatives generally have cotton purchasing and processing institutions, so as long as the organization and leadership are strengthened, this production task can be completely completed and overfulfilled.

In addition, there are individual areas that are afraid that linters production will lose money. This concern is also unnecessary. In the early stage of linters production, costs may be higher due to insufficient experience. But precisely because of this, when the state studies and determines the price of linters, it must take this situation into account and resolve it reasonably.

All regions should seriously explain these erroneous ideas and concerns that do not conform to reality, quickly overcome them, and reverse the slack and slow phenomena in the work. Individual areas that have not yet established specialized offices should quickly establish and improve them, and strengthen the organizational leadership of linters production.

Since the time for preparing and adding various delinting equipment is very tight, the task of stripping a large amount of linters is very arduous, and this work is in its initial stage, it is estimated that many difficulties will be encountered in the work. Therefore, the party committees and governments in all cotton-producing areas must earnestly strengthen their leadership over the supply and marketing cooperatives, give them all the support they deserve, and organize the cotton seed oil industry departments and purchasing departments to cooperate with each other, and earnestly do a good job in stripping linters to ensure the victorious completion of this task.

### 一笔很大的财富

　　一笔很大的财富
    在棉花和棉布生产不足的今天，棉籽上的短绒棉对于我们国家是一笔很大的财富。
  几年来，我们国家曾经采取各种措施，增加了棉布的供应，改善了人民的生活，这是应该肯定的。由于我国社会购买力不断的提高和棉花生产赶不上纺织工业原料的需要，国家虽然采取了各种措施来增加棉布的生产和供应，但是人民对于棉布的需要还是不能满足的。为了解决我国棉布生产不足和广大人民对棉布不断增加的需要之间的矛盾，最根本的办法有两个。一个办法是大量使用化学肥料来增产棉花，另一个办法是大力发展合成纤维和其他人造纤维，部分地代替棉花。但是，采用这两个办法，都需要相当长的时间，短期内还不能收到显著的效果。从目前的情况来说，充分利用棉籽上的短绒棉是最便捷的办法之一。
    我国短绒棉的资源很大，按照现有全国植棉面积估算，可产棉籽约五千万担。其中国家通过收购籽棉而掌握的棉籽约有二千万担，农民加工出来的棉籽约有三千万担。如果能够将这些棉籽上的短绒全部剥取下来，约有三百万担。其中约有一百万担到一百二十万担可作絮棉使用。顶替出来的棉花，可纺纱三十万件，能织布一千二百万匹，等于全国每人平均增加二尺布。其余的二百万担是化学工业的好原料，可以在国内利用，也可以出口。因此，充分利用短绒棉资源，不但对于缓和目前我国棉花不足和棉布供应紧张的形势有重大的意义，而且还可以为国家增加一笔很大的收入。
    因此，国务院最近曾经专门作出指示，要求全国供销合作总社采取各种有效措施，在一、二年内把国家所掌握的棉籽上的短绒全部剥取下来，把棉农自轧的棉籽上的短绒也大部分剥取下来。由于1957年全国植棉面积比1956年减少六百多万亩，有些地区的棉田又遭受了水灾，因此，剥取短绒棉就更加显得重要。
    从当前的情况看，剥取短绒棉的工作中有以下两个重大的问题需要解决：
    第一个问题，是增添剥绒设备的问题，我国现有的剥绒设备远不能担负上述大量剥绒的任务。为了解决这个问题，国务院已经批准全国供销合作总社在1957年度原计划添置剥绒机的基础上，再增添一部分。目前距离新棉花上市的时间很短，各地对于新添的剥绒机器，必须作出合理的安排，并且迅速地安装起来。此外，要求有关工业部门，想尽一切办法，供给剥取短绒棉所需的各项机械和动力设备，保证向用货的地区和部门如期交货。其他有关部门也应该对这一项重要工作加以支持。
    第二个问题，是集中剥绒同分散剥绒的问题。从增产短绒棉的要求上考虑，国家多收购一些籽棉，集中剥绒的办法比较好。几年来国家向农民收购的籽棉，折成皮棉约占全部收购量50％左右。有的地区很少，例如湖北、山西、陕西、四川等省只接近20％。因此，在籽棉收购比重较小的地区，国家有必要适当地多购一些籽棉。在其他地区，农业社为了从事副业生产而自行加工的籽棉，也不应超过上一年度的数量。对于分散在农民手中的棉籽上短绒的剥取，还可以采取三个办法：第一、由供销社轧花厂按互利原则代农民加工剥绒。国家收购短绒，加工厂酌量收取加工费，剩下的棉籽还给农民。第二、组织农业社利用现有的畜力或水力皮辊轧花机剥取头道短绒，国家予以收购。第三、国家可以用食油和油饼换取农民的棉籽来剥绒，但是向农民换取的棉籽，只限于按照统购统销政策留给农民自用的这一部分。应该认识到，国家能够多剥取短绒棉，不仅能够增加棉布的生产，而且也可以增加城乡人民的棉布供应。这样做，对于国家和棉农都是有利的。所以全国棉农应该踊跃地将籽棉多卖给国家，使国家能够多掌握棉籽进行剥绒。
    对于剥取短绒棉的任务，现在各地一般地已经重视起来。河北、山东等省已经积极组织力量具体进行。但是，也有一些地区把农业社轧花副业生产和国家组织农业社轧花力量配合剥绒完全对立起来，认为一经国家组织，便会影响农业社的副业收入。这种看法是片面的。目前农业社拥有棉籽资源的一半以上，不把农业社的轧花力量加以组织，配备相应的剥绒设备，要充分利用短绒资源便是一句空话。问题是要采取适合当地情况的各种各样的方式方法。比如，把农业社的轧花力量组织到棉花采购站的周围，根据轧花能力，由供销社安装剥绒设备，成立轧花剥绒站，由供销社统一领导，对农业社的轧花设备和劳动力给予合理的报酬；或者由供销社按照农业社轧花设备的分布情况，安装剥绒机，分散剥绒。这样对国家和农业社都是有利的。只要讲清道理，农业社是会完全赞成的。
    有些地方怀疑短绒生产计划冒进了，因而趑趄不前，这也是不对的。我们认为，冒进不冒进主要决定于短绒生产的条件。目前短绒生产资源丰富，国家迫切需要；剥绒设备所需的物资与资金都能充分供应；供销社普遍都有棉花采购和加工的机构，因此只要加强组织领导，就完全可以完成和超额完成这个生产任务。
    此外，还有个别地区害怕短绒生产会赔钱。这顾虑也是不必要的。在短绒生产的初期，因为经验不够，成本可能高些。但是正因为这样，国家在研究确定短绒价格的时候，就要估计到这个情况，加以合理的解决。
    对于这些不符合实际的错误思想和顾虑，各地应该认真进行解释，迅速克服，扭转工作中的松劲和迟缓现象。个别地区尚未建立专门办事机构的，应迅速建立和健全起来，加强短绒生产的组织领导工作。
    由于筹建和增添各项剥绒设备的时间非常紧迫，大量剥取短绒棉的任务又很艰巨，而且这个工作正处于初创阶段，估计在工作中将会遇到许多困难。因此，各产棉地区的党委和政府对供销社要切实加强领导，给以各种应有的支持，并且很好地组织棉籽油脂工业部门和收购部门互相配合，认真做好剥取短绒的工作，保证这一任务的胜利完成。
