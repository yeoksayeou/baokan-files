Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 7th – To date, Shanghai's urban area has expanded by nearly one-half compared to before liberation. Shanghai's current urban area is more than 110 square kilometers. During the Kuomintang reactionary rule, Shanghai's urban area was only more than 80 square kilometers. Since liberation, the newly added urban area is mainly new factories and workers' residences.

Over the past eight years, the funds spent by the state on urban construction such as housing, roads, bridges, electric lights, telephones, and tap water for the working people are equivalent to approximately two million taels of gold.

In recent years, Shanghai has built more than three million square meters of worker housing, and five to six hundred thousand workers and their families have moved into new homes. The state has also filled in dozens of stinking ditches running through the shantytowns.

The number of water supply stations in workers' residential areas has increased from more than 150 in the past to more than 1,800. More than 160,000 working people's families have newly connected electric lights. More than 50 public transportation routes have been newly opened and adjusted between industrial areas and workers' residential areas, and between urban and suburban areas.

    上海城区面积扩大一半
    据新华社上海7日电　到目前为止，上海城区面积比解放以前扩大了近二分之一。上海现在的城区面积是一百一十多平方公里。而国民党反动统治时期，上海城区面积只有八十多平方公里。解放以后，新增加的城市面积，主要是新的工厂和工人住宅。
    八年多来，国家为劳动人民修建住宅、道路、桥梁和楼上电灯、电话、自来水等城市建设所花费的资金，折合成黄金约二百万两。
    这几年里，上海兴建了三百多万平方公尺的工人住宅，有五、六十万职工和家属搬进了新居。国家还填平了几十条横贯在棚户区的臭水沟。
    工人住宅区的给水站已经由过去的一百五十多个增加到一千八百多个。十六万多个劳动人民的家庭新接上了电灯。在工业区和工人住宅区之间、市区和郊区之间，新开辟和调整了五十多条公共交通路线。
