　　Rebutting "Grave Robbing and Corpse鞭尸"
　　Shi Yitao
    After the expanded symposium of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee exposed the criminal histories of rightists Long Yun and Huang Shaohong, KMT Revolutionary Committee members Chen Liangzuo, Chen Xiong, and Lai Huipeng in Guangxi jointly wrote to Li Jishen, chairman of the KMT Revolutionary Committee, expressing their dissent. They believed this was "grave robbing and鞭尸," which "cannot but cause a sense of terror and alarm." Therefore, they advocated that "the trend of ‘grave robbing and鞭尸’ should be stopped immediately."
    Water has a source, and trees have roots. It is only natural to criticize the current reactionary words and deeds of rightists by linking them to their past criminal histories. How can this be called "grave robbing and鞭尸"? In fact, those rightists with historical crimes are not "corpses" in the "grave"—just a skull or a few dry bones; but living people who continue to stand on the reactionary positions of the past, using every opportunity to carry out anti-Communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist activities. Such people must be thoroughly exposed and criticized, and in no way "should it be stopped immediately."
    However, in the eyes of people like Chen Liangzuo, because the "historical filth of many people is destined," the "trend" of exposing history, "if it continues to spread, will lead to a situation where everyone is in danger." It seems that Chen Liangzuo and his ilk probably thought that by playing this trick, they could scare many people and make them unwilling to actively expose the crimes of the rightists.
    In fact, exposing criminal histories is not some kind of "trend," and it is not as if people's past histories are dug up for no reason. The people are magnanimous. Even if someone has committed great crimes in the past, as long as they come over to the side of the people, the people will not hold the past against them and will give them appropriate arrangements. Since the founding of the country, the Communist Party and the People's Government have been doing this. There are countless examples. This is obvious to all. However, there are some people who are ungrateful to the people. No matter how tolerant the people are towards them, they never intend to turn over a new leaf, but only harbor thoughts of restoration. Once there is an opportunity, they try to make a comeback and overthrow the people's regime. Many of the rightists who have been discovered in this rectification movement are such people who repay kindness with hatred. For these people, one cannot but investigate the roots and sources while exposing their current crimes, tracing their past criminal histories. The matter is very clear: exposing the criminal histories of these people is not because these people were guilty in the past, but because they are now re-committing the crime of being anti-people. For many people who were guilty in the past but are not now guilty of anti-Communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist crimes, the people still maintain a spirit of leniency and do not hold the past against them.
    Here, let me use a not-so-exact analogy: if we compare a dirty history to a disease, then many people from the old society have suffered from such "diseases" to varying degrees. In the years since liberation, some people have seriously carried out ideological remolding, sincerely accepted the leadership of the Communist Party, and are willing to follow the socialist road with the people. Such people have become healthy individuals. Is there any need to mention their old "disease" again? However, there is another kind of person whose disease is not cured, and now the old disease has recurred. For such patients, doctors will not only ask about their current illness, but also about the illnesses they have had in the past. They will not only ask about the patient's own illness, but will often need to ask about the illnesses of their direct relatives. Only in this way can they truly understand the causes and consequences of the disease. This is the common sense of every doctor treating a disease. Exposing the ugly histories of rightists, in a sense, is also the same principle. But there are no such doctors who do not treat patients but specialize in checking the medical records of good people, asking about their past illnesses and roots, and even asking about what illnesses their direct relatives have had. Of course, there are probably no such people who are not currently ill but are afraid that doctors will check their medical records. Chen Liangzuo and his ilk are so afraid of people tracing their past criminal histories, it seems that it is because they are suffering from the same rightist disease as Long Yun, Huang Shaohong, and others, and are simply feeling sorry for each other!

### 斥“掘墓鞭尸”

　　斥“掘墓鞭尸”
　　石一迢
    民革中央小组扩大座谈会揭发了右派分子龙云、黄绍竑的罪恶历史后，远在广西的民革成员陈良佐、陈雄、赖慧鹏联名给民革主席李济深写信，提出异议。他们认为这是“掘墓鞭尸”，“殊难令人不起怵目惊心之感”。因此主张：“‘掘墓鞭尸’的风气应该马上结束”。
    水有源，树有根，批判右派分子现在的反动言行，联系到他们过去的罪恶历史，这原是十分自然的事情，怎么能说是“掘墓鞭尸”呢？事实上，那些有历史罪恶的右派分子，并不是“墓”里边的“尸”——只有髑髅一个、枯骨几根；而是一个活活的人，继续的站在过去的反动立场上，利用一切机会进行反共、反人民、反社会主义的活动。对于这样的人，必须彻底地进行揭露和批判，无论如何也不“应该马上结束”。
    可是，在陈良佐之流看来，因为许多人“历史的肮脏是注定了的”，所以，揭发历史的“风气”“如再蔓延下去，将会导致人人自危”的局面。看来，陈良佐之流大概以为来这么一手，就把许多人吓住了，就会使许多人不愿积极起来揭发右派分子的罪恶了。
    其实，揭发罪恶历史并不是什么“风气”，并不是无端地就硬要把别人过去的历史揭出来。人民是宽宏大量的，即使是过去有偌大的罪恶，只要他投奔人民，人民还是不咎既往，给予适当的安置。开国以来，共产党和人民政府就是这样做的。例子不胜枚举。人所共见。可是，就有那么一些对人民忘恩负义的人，无论人民对他怎样宽容，他总是毫无洗心革面之意，只有阴谋复辟之念。一旦有机可乘，他们就图东山再起，推翻人民的天下。这次整风运动中发现出来的右派分子，许多就是这样恩将仇报的人。对于这些人，人们就不能不在揭发他们的现行罪恶的同时，索本寻源，追查他们过去的罪恶的历史了。事情很清楚，揭发这些人的罪恶历史，并不是因为这些人过去有罪，而是因为他们现在重犯反人民之罪。对于许多过去有罪而现在并没有反共、反人民、反社会主义之罪的人，人民依然是一本宽大精神，不咎既往的。
    这里，试举一个不十分确切的比喻：如果将肮脏的历史比做疾病，那么，许多从旧社会来的人都程度不同地生过这样的“病”。解放几年来，有些人认真进行思想改造，诚心诚意地接受共产党的领导，愿意和人民一起走社会主义的道路，这样的人已经成了一个健壮的人，有什么必要再去提他的旧“病”呢？但是，也有另外一种人，病根未除，现在又旧病新发。医生对于这种病人，不仅会问到他现在的病，而且也会问到过去曾经得过的病，不只会问他本人的病，还常常需要问他的直系亲属有什么病，这样，才能真正了解病的来龙去脉，这是每一个医生治病的常识。揭发右派分子的丑恶历史，在某种意义上说来，也是这个道理。但是却没有这样的医生，他不去医治病人，却专门去查问好人的病历，追问人家过去的病情和病根，甚至追问人家直系亲属生过什么病。当然，恐怕也没有这样的人，自己现在没有病，却惧怕医生会查他的病历。陈良佐之流那样怕人家追查过去的罪恶历史，看来就是因为他们和龙云、黄绍竑之流害着同样的右派病，是同病相怜罢了！
