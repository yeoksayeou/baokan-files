Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, August 19th: Syrian Foreign Ministry Secretary-General Tarazi said on August 17th that Syria considers its issue of expelling American diplomatic personnel to have "ended, and hopes that the relations between the two countries will improve in the future."

When reporters asked Tarazi if there would be more American diplomatic personnel expelled from Syria, he said: "For the time being, we have stopped and are not prepared to take further action." He said that Syria hopes that American "diplomatic personnel will not use diplomatic privileges to carry out activities that endanger our country's security."

Tarazi pointed out that three American diplomatic personnel were expelled from Syria because of a conspiracy to overthrow the current Syrian regime. He said: "The Syrian government cannot remain indifferent to such a very serious and major issue."

Tarazi accused the United States of "threatening Syria" politically and economically. In economic terms, he said that the United States sold wheat to Greece and Italy last month at prices lower than those offered by Syria, in quantities equal to what these two countries originally intended to purchase from Syria. He pointed out that "the United States is unwilling to tolerate the current Syrian regime."

According to the "Victory Daily," the United States originally planned to launch this foiled conspiracy to subvert the current Syrian government on August 17th, but it was discovered and crushed in time by the Syrian military authorities.

The "Victory Daily" said that the activities of the American Middle East intelligence office have increased. Rome and Beirut have been selected as bases for organizing and implementing American conspiracies. It is reported that Saudi Arabian King Saud has urgently summoned the Saudi Arabian Ambassador to Syria, Saed, back to the country to report on the situation in Syria.

Saed held a long consultation with President Kuwatly on the 17th and gave him a letter from the Saudi King. After this, he also met with Prime Minister Assali.

According to Agence France-Presse, Saudi Arabian figures do not conceal their concern about the possible consequences of the current crisis between Syria and the United States. They feel that this may threaten the oil pipelines of the Arabian American Oil Company (ARAMCO) that pass through Syrian territory.

    叙利亚外交部秘书长
    严斥美国施行政治和经济威胁
    宣布驱逐美国外交人员问题已告结束
    新华社19日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚外交部秘书长塔拉齐8月17日说，叙利亚认为它驱逐美国外交人员的问题“已告结束，并且希望将来两国的关系会得到改善”。
    当记者问塔拉齐是否还会有一些美国外交人员被叙利亚驱逐出境时，他说：“暂时，我们已经停止，不准备采取进一步的行动”。他说，叙利亚希望美国“外交人员将不利用外交特权进行危害我国安全的活动”。
    塔拉齐指出，三个美国外交人员是因为企图推翻叙利亚现政权的阴谋而被驱逐出叙利亚的。他说：“叙利亚政府对这样一个非常严重和重大的问题不能保持无动于衷的态度。”
    塔拉齐指责美国从政治上和经济上“威胁叙利亚”。在经济方面，他说，美国在上个月以低于叙利亚的价格把小麦卖给希腊和意大利，其数量正和这两个国家原来打算向叙利亚购买的相等。他指出，“美国不愿容忍目前的叙利亚政权”。
    据“胜利报”报道，美国本来要在8月17日发动这次被破获的颠覆叙利亚现政府的阴谋，但是被叙利亚军事当局及时发现而被粉碎。
    “胜利报”说，美国的中东情报处的活动增加了。罗马和贝鲁特被选择为组织和实行美国阴谋的基地。据报道，沙特阿拉伯国王沙特已经急召沙特阿拉伯驻叙大使赛义德回国报告叙利亚局势。
    赛义德在17日曾经同库阿特利总统进行了长时间的磋商，并且给了他一封沙特国王的信。在这以后，他还会见了阿萨利总理。
    据法新社报道，沙特阿拉伯人士并不掩饰他们关心叙利亚和美国之间目前危机可能产生的后果。他们感到这可能使阿美石油公司的沙特阿拉伯石油经过叙利亚领土的油管受到威胁。
