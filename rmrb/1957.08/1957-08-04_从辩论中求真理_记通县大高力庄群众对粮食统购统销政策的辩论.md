Seeking Truth from Debate
    ——An Account of the Debate on the Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain Policy Among the Masses of Dagao Lizhuang, Tong County
    An Yaoguang, Zhang Yufeng

    A Question of Principle

    Recently, when we were explaining and discussing the question of how to correctly handle contradictions among the people in Democratic Cooperative of Dagao Lizhuang, Zhangjiawan Township, Tong County, an old farmer named Wang Yongrui sharply raised a question: "The Communist Party is good in every way, but it's not good that too little grain is left for us." This opinion was immediately supported by Ma Cai, the leader of the eighth team, and others. Some said, "One jin of grain per person per day isn't even enough to fill a tooth gap." Some shouted, "The farmers' pot lids are welded shut, and can't be opened." Some complained, "The farmers have no strength, the livestock are thin from hunger, and they falter when working and pulling things." Some even suggested, "Each person should be given an extra half a jin of grain per day, or there will be no way to produce."

    This is a question of principle. Is the unified purchase and sale of grain good or bad? Is the amount of grain retained sufficient or not? What is the fundamental path to improving our lives?… All of these need to be clarified from the root.

    Have Farmers Suffered Losses from the Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain?

    The work team studied everyone's thinking and felt that it would be best for everyone to debate this question. Therefore, it was decided to spend half a day allowing everyone to argue the point. Everyone agreed to this approach.

    At the beginning of the debate, some people who were dissatisfied with the unified purchase and sale of grain complained that "the grain retention quota was set too tightly," saying, "In the past, the farmers were fat with oil, but now the farmers are starving."

    Immediately, someone asked, "Who was fat with oil in the past?" Someone said, "A few landlords and rich peasants were fat with oil, but the vast majority of farmers were as thin as skeletons. In our village, before liberation, out of 295 households, 187 were poor peasants. They did not live 'fat with oil' lives, but rather carried long-term work and short-term labor for the landlords and rich peasants, working themselves to death, 'sweating buckets'. Now, everyone has joined the advanced cooperative and embarked on the road to collective prosperity, with every family having food and drink. Because we suffered a disaster last year, life is a little tight, and people are complaining about the government. Isn't this a case of forgetting the pain once the sore is healed?"

    Liu Wenming said: "Take Ma Cai for example. Before liberation, he was so poor that he stole things. The landlords and rich peasants tried every means to catch him, scaring him so much that he abandoned his wife and fled to Tianjin. He even wrote to his wife saying that he couldn't support her and that she should remarry. His wife refused, picked up a wooden stick, and begged for food everywhere, not even having a place to stay at night. After liberation, he turned over and built a new house this year. If it weren't for the Communist Party, would he have what he has today? But he didn't listen to the cadres' advice and spent several days treating people to meals when he was building his house, wasting grain. Now he turns around and complains that the government is supplying too little grain and that there is not enough to eat. How much grain would be enough to withstand such waste?"

    Song Wenzao said: "When you speak, you must think before you act. You can't just let your head get hot, open your mouth, and say that the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain is bad. Who doesn't know that our county has always been a grain-deficient county, relying on the state to transfer in large quantities of grain every year. In 1954, 35.48 million jin were transferred in, in 1955, 9.25 million jin were transferred in, and last year, 55.6 million jin were transferred in. Last year, our village alone was supplied with 527,800 jin of grain by the state, ensuring that everyone had enough to eat. If it had been before liberation, in such a disaster year, people would have either fled the famine or starved to death. Didn't Liu Fuhou flee to Xuanhua during a disaster year and starve to death there? Last year, despite such a large disaster, no one in our village fled the famine, and no one starved to death. Isn't this the achievement of the unified purchase and sale of grain?" Everyone said, "That's right. This is the truth. The farmers have not suffered losses from the unified purchase and sale of grain, but have benefited greatly from it."

    Is the Amount of Grain Retained Sufficient?

    At this time, Wang Yongrui asked, "Is one jin of grain per person per day enough to eat? Someone said, "We use an eight-and-a-half-jin hoe all day long to till the land, and two jin of grain is not enough." Han Wancai, the old leader of the sixth team, said: "Don't look at me being over sixty years old. If you give me two jin of corn flour every day, without any vegetables, see if I can finish it!" Someone immediately said, "When did farmers ever just eat grain without any vegetables?" Some said, "Whether it is enough or not depends on how you eat: If you save and use sparingly, it is enough; if you use up all the rice in one pot and all the firewood in one stove, it is not enough." Some said, "That's right. Take Hong Xuejun for example. His family has eight people, with few adults and many children. After the implementation of fixed quotas per person, each person averaged only twenty-three jin, but they knew how to save, and they started eating substitutes from the beginning. Now they still have more than fifty jin of grain in reserve." Wang Yongrui asked, "Which family in our village doesn't eat substitutes? Why is it that every family doesn't have enough?" Song Wenzao, who manages finances and grain, said: "Empty words are not enough, there must be accounts to prove it. Since the disaster last year, our entire village has only bought one thousand jin of potatoes and one hundred and fifty jin of dried cabbage. Don't forget that there are 328 households in our village! Calculate how many jin that is per family?" This revelation caused a burst of laughter.

    Wang Yongrui Just Smiled and Said Nothing

    Wang Yongrui said: "Hey, to tell the truth, what I fear is that in the future, all four seasons will always be one jin, then what hope is there for farmers?" Some said, "When did the government say that the grain supply quota would always be one jin per day? Didn't they say long ago that if production increases, the amount of grain retained will also increase?" Someone held up the *Hebei Daily* and said: "Isn't this reporting on the matter of the Bohai Cooperative in Funing County? They increased production last year, and each person retained 530 jin of grain." Someone said, "Chairman Mao said that within a few years, the entire peasantry should reach the level of middle peasants or above. Is there any need to worry about it always being one jin?" Everyone's eyes focused on Wang Yongrui. However, he just smiled and said nothing.

    Through free discussion and heated debate, the issues were basically clarified. Everyone reflected that it was very good and they were in high spirits. People who were originally dissatisfied with the grain policy said: "Why didn't you say this earlier? If you had explained the reasoning clearly earlier, we wouldn't have just gone down a blind alley!"

    从辩论中求真理
    ——记通县大高力庄群众对粮食统购统销政策的辩论
    安耀光、张玉峰
    一个带原则性的问题
    最近，我们在通县张家湾乡大高力庄民主社，讲解和讨论怎样正确对待人民内部矛盾的问题的时候，老农王永瑞尖锐地提出了一个问题：“共产党什么都好，就是粮食留的太少不好。”这个意见立即得到了八队队长马才等人的支持，有的说：“每人每天一斤粮食还不够塞牙缝哩。”有的嚷：“农民的锅盖都焊上了，揭不开了。”有的抱怨：“农民没劲了，牲口饿瘦了，干活拉东西都打幌油了”。甚至有的提出：“每人每天应增加半斤粮食，要不没法生产了。”
    这是一个带原则性的问题，粮食统购统销到底好不好？留粮到底够吃不够吃？改善生活的根本道路是什么？……，都需要从根本上加以澄清。
    实行粮食统购统销，农民是吃亏了吗？
    工作组研究了大家的思想情况，认为这个问题最好由大家来对证，于是确定用半天时间大家进行争辩。大家都同意这种作法。
    辩论一开始，一些对粮食统购统销不满的人，都抱怨“留粮指标打的太紧”，说：“过去农民肥的流油，现在农民饿了肚皮。”
    马上有人问：“过去什么人肥的流油？”有人说：“少数地主富农肥的流油，大多数农民瘦成一把骨头。咱村解放前二百九十五户中，就有一百八十七户是贫农，他们过的不是‘肥的流油’的日子，而是替地主富农扛长活、作短工、累死累活‘汗流浃背’的日子。现在，大伙都入了高级社，走上了集体富裕的道路，家家有吃有喝了，因为去年受了灾，生活有点紧就抱怨起政府来，这不是好了疮忘了疼是什么？”
    刘文明说：“就说马才吧，解放前他穷的偷东西，地主富农变着法的逮他，吓的他扔下老婆一翅子跑到天津，还给他老婆写信回来说，我没法子养活你，你改嫁吧。他老婆不肯，挟起木棍来到处讨饭吃，黑夜连个存身的窝窝也没有。解放后，翻了身，今年还盖起了新房子，要不是共产党他那有今天？可是他不听干部的劝告，请人盖房子一连管了好几天饭，把粮食浪费了，反倒回来埋怨政府供应粮食少了，粮食不够吃了，供应多少粮食能搁住浪费呢？”
    宋文藻说：“说话总得前思思后想想，不能脑瓜子一热，上下嘴唇一对就说粮食统购统销政策不好。谁不知道咱们县早就是一个缺粮县，年年都依靠国家调入大批粮食。1954年调入了三千五百四十八万斤，1955年调入了九百二十五万斤，去年调入了五千五百六十万斤。去年光咱一个村国家就供应了五十二万七千八百斤粮食，保证了大家吃粮。要是在解放前，碰上这样的灾荒年，不是逃荒，就是饿死。刘福厚不就是在灾年逃荒到宣化去，饿死在那里吗？去年那么大灾，咱村没有一个逃荒的，更没有一个饿死的，这不是粮食统购统销的成绩是什么？”大家都说：“说的对。这是大实话。农民不是吃了粮食统购统销的亏，而是沾了粮食统购统销的大光了。”
    留粮到底够不够吃？
    这时候，王永瑞提出：“每人每天一斤粮食到底够吃不够吃？有人说：“我们整天拿八斤半的大锄耪地，没有二斤粮食那够？”六队老队长韩万才说：“别看我六十多岁了，你每天给我二斤玉米面，不掺菜，看我吃完吃不完？”马上有人说：“庄稼主过日子什么时候光啃过粮食不掺菜？”有的说：“够不够还得看怎么个吃法：省吃俭用，细水长流就够吃；有米一锅，有柴一灶就不够吃。”有的说：“这话说的对。就说洪学俊吧，他家八口人，成人少，孩子多，实行以人定量后每人才平均二十三斤，可是人家知道节省，一开头就掺吃代食品，现在还有五十多斤存粮呢？”王永瑞问：“咱村那家不吃代食品？为什么家家都不够？”管财粮的宋文藻说：“空口无凭，有账为证。从去年闹灾后咱全村只买了土豆一千斤，干白菜一百五十斤。不要忘了咱村是三百二十八户呀！算算一家才合几斤？”这一抖老底，引起了哄堂大笑。
    王永瑞光笑不言声了
    王永瑞说：“嘿，说实话吧，我怕的是往后一年四季永远都是一斤，那庄稼主过日子还有什么盼头呢？”有的说：“政府什么时候说过粮食供应指标永远是每天一斤？不是早讲过增产多了，留的粮食也就多了吗？”有人举起河北日报说：
  “这不是登着抚宁县渤海社的事吗？人家那里去年增了产，每人留粮合五百三十斤。”有人说：“毛主席讲了，在几年内要使全体农民达到中农或中农以上的生活水平，还用得着担心永远是一斤吗？”大家的眼光集中到王永瑞身上。可是，他却光笑不言声了。
    经过自由讨论和热烈争辩，问题基本上搞通了。大家都反映很好，情绪很高。原来对粮食政策不满意的人说：“你们为什么不早说？早把道理讲清楚，我们不会光钻牛角尖！”
