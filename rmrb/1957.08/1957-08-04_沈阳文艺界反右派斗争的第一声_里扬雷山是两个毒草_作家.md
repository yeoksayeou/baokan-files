Shenyang, August 3rd (This newspaper's dispatch) The Liaoning Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the "Chunlei" Editorial Department recently made preliminary revelations of the rightist words and deeds of Li Yang, Lei Shan, and others. This is the first sound of the anti-Rightist struggle in the silent Shenyang literary and art circles.

Li Yang is the author of the novel "Return" (signed as Cai Shi), published in the July issue of the "Chunlei" magazine. In this novel, Li Yang blatantly "summoned the souls" of the villains who deserved to die in previous movements. She painstakingly fabricated two so-called degenerated and deteriorated "Party cadres" who colluded with each other in the "Three-Anti" movement, acting arbitrarily without leadership from above or masses from below, and framed innocent good people. Finally, she even brought out a bloody corpse of a so-called victim to slander the Three-Anti Movement led by the Party.

This vicious cannonball aimed at the Party received the full support of Lei Shan, the head of the novel group of the "Chunlei" Editorial Department. Lei Shan spent two or three days working with her to concoct the poisonous weed "Return," and volunteered to write a supportive article. During the editorial department's discussion of the works for the July issue, Lei Shan strongly advocated putting "Return" on the front page. Although he was opposed by everyone, he still argued red-facedly. Lei Shan also concealed from everyone and arbitrarily moved the anti-Rightist "Blast Furnace" (miscellaneous essay column) from the top spot, placing the novel "Return" in the first article; when sending out the manuscript, he also had the title of "Return" typeset with lead and added two illustrations. From this, it can be seen that Lei Shan not only served as the manufacturer of this vicious cannonball, but also a "brave" shooter.

The fierce anti-Rightist struggle is unfolding on all fronts in Shenyang, but only the literary and art circles here are still calm. The situation discovered by "Chunlei" is not unique. Shenyang's other literary and art publication, "Mangzhong," has even more serious problems, but there is still no sound of the anti-Rightist struggle.

### 沈阳文艺界反右派斗争的第一声  里扬雷山是两个毒草“作家”

    沈阳文艺界反右派斗争的第一声
    里扬雷山是两个毒草“作家”
    本报沈阳3日电　辽宁省文联及“春雷”编辑部，最近初步揭发了里扬、雷山等人的右派言行。这是沉寂的沈阳文艺界开始反右派斗争的第一声。
    里扬是小说“归来”的作者（署名采石），发表于7月号的“春雷”杂志上。在这篇小说里，里扬明目张胆地为历次运动中死有余辜的坏蛋“招魂”。她煞费心机地捏造了两个所谓蜕化变质的“党员干部”，在“三反”运动中互相勾结，在上无领导，下无群众的情况下，任所欲为，陷害无辜的好人。最后，还搬出一具所谓被害者的鲜血淋淋的尸体，用以污蔑党所领导的三反运动。
    这颗向党射击的恶毒的炮弹，受到了“春雷”编辑部小说组组长雷山的全力支持。雷山一连两三天和她共同泡制“归来”这颗毒草，并自告奋勇赶写了一篇捧场文章。在编辑部讨论7月号的作品时，雷山极力主张把“归来”放在头条，虽然遭到大家反对，他还面红耳赤地力争。雷山还瞒着大家擅自将反右派的“鼓风炉”（杂文专栏）头条栏目移后，将小说“归来”放在首篇；发稿时并把“归来”的标题制了铅版，并添了两幅插图。由此可知，雷山不但兼任了这颗恶毒的炮弹的制造者，而且还是一名“勇敢”的射手。
    激烈的反右派斗争正在沈阳各个战线展开，唯有这里的文艺界还是风平浪静。“春雷”发现的情况并不是唯一无二的，沈阳另一个文艺刊物“芒种”就有更严重的问题，但至今还没有反右派斗争的声音。
