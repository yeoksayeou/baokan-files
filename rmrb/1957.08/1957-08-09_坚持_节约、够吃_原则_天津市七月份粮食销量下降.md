According to statistics from the Tianjin Grain Bureau, grain sales in July decreased by 4.84 million jin compared to June, accounting for 98.3% of the planned sales volume for July.

The Municipal People's Committee called on citizens to save half a jin to one jin of grain per person per month based on the principle of saving and eating enough.

    坚持“节约、够吃”原则
    天津市七月份粮食销量下降
    据新华社天津7日电　天津市开展整顿粮食统销工作以来，粮食销量逐渐下降。据天津市粮食局统计，7月份的粮食销售量比6月份减少了四百八十四万斤，为7月份计划销售量的98.3％。
    今年上半年，天津市居民、机关、团体、企业中先后开展了整顿粮食统销工作。市人民委员会号召市民本着节约够吃的原则，每人每月节约粮食半斤到一斤。结果，全市有一百五十一万多人减少了粮食定量供应的数量，每月共节约一百七十万多斤。全市人民的每人平均定量也由二十九点三二斤下降到二十八点七一斤。
