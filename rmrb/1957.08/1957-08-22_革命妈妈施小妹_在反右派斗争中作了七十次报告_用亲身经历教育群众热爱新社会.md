Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 21st. Sixty-eight-year-old textile worker Shi Xiaomei is currently engaging in reasoning struggles with bourgeois rightists at the Shanghai Municipal People's Congress.

Shi Xiaomei's hair is already gray, but her spirits are high. Since May of this year, she has given seventy reports at Fudan University, East China Normal University, Industrial and Commercial Political School, factories, and government organizations. She uses her personal experience of participating in the revolution for more than thirty years to refute the rightists' anti-Communist and anti-socialist fallacies.

Shi Xiaomei entered the yarn factory at the age of eleven and participated in the Shanghai workers' "May 30th" general strike and three armed uprisings. She still keeps a seal she used to distribute relief funds to striking workers at that time. In 1928, she herself was hunted down by reactionaries and fled from place to place. Her husband was arrested, her eldest son was sacrificed in the struggle, and her two younger sons died one after another because no one took care of them. She said: "I have been waiting for the Communist Party for more than twenty years. Finally, I have waited for liberation. Now the rightists want to pull us back to the old path. We workers will never agree." Many workers and students wrote to her after listening to her report, affectionately calling her "Mother," and expressing their determination to fight back against the bourgeois rightists' attacks by doing a good job in production and studying hard.

Once, Shi Xiaomei gave a report at the Industrial and Commercial Political School. A student asked her: "Farmers made great contributions to the revolution. Why wasn't the Chinese revolution led by the farmers?" Shi Xiaomei immediately answered him bluntly: "If you can't figure out this question, I think you are fake. Your true intention is for the bourgeoisie to lead!" A few words left the student speechless. Another industrialist and businessman said after listening to her report: "Now I am truly convinced of the leadership of the working class."

Shi Xiaomei was originally illiterate. She only started learning to read and write at the age of sixty, the year Shanghai was liberated. Now she can write simple drafts, read newspapers, and some popular reading materials. She reads newspapers and listens to news broadcasts for at least half an hour every day. When she learned that the rightists were taking advantage of the Communist Party's rectification to launch a frenzied attack on the Party and the socialist cause, she couldn't bear it anymore. She told the street government office where she worked: The rightists are attacking the Party like this, and we workers should speak up. So, she gave revolutionary stories day and night, telling people not to be deceived by the rightists' lies.

Shi Xiaomei has always been an active propagandist and mobilizer of the Party's policies in previous political movements. She likes to tell people: People like me who have no sons or daughters would have starved to death long ago in the old society. I want to use my own experience to educate the younger generation to love the Party and love the new society. Since she retired from Shanghai State-owned Cotton Factory No. 6 two years ago, she has been giving reports more frequently. From 1952 to the present, she has given four hundred and thirty reports, and more than 600,000 people have listened to her reports. The name "Revolutionary Mother Shi Xiaomei" is almost known to everyone in Shanghai's factories and schools.

### 革命妈妈施小妹  在反右派斗争中作了七十次报告  用亲身经历教育群众热爱新社会

　　革命妈妈施小妹
　  在反右派斗争中作了七十次报告
    用亲身经历教育群众热爱新社会
    新华社上海21日电　六十八岁的老纺织女工施小妹，这几天正在上海市人民代表大会上和资产阶级右派分子进行说理斗争。
    施小妹的头发已经花白，但精神很好。今年5月到现在，她先后在复旦大学、华东师范学院、工商界政治学校和工厂、机关等单位作了七十次报告。她用自己参加革命三十多年的亲身经历，来驳斥右派分子反共和反社会主义的谬论。
    施小妹十一岁就进纱厂做工，是上海工人“五卅”大罢工和三次武装起义的参加者，至今身边还保存着一颗她当时向罢工工人发放救济金用的图章。1928年，她自己被反动派追捕得东奔西逃，丈夫被捕，大儿子在斗争中牺牲，两个小儿子也因无人照顾相继而死。她说：“我盼望共产党盼望了二十多年，好容易盼到了解放，现在右派分子想拉我们回到老路上去，我们工人决不答应。”很多工人、学生听了她的报告后，纷纷写信给她，亲热地称她“妈妈”，表示一定要以搞好生产、努力学习来反击资产阶级右派分子的进攻。
    有一次，施小妹在工商界政治学校作报告，有个学员问她：“农民在革命中贡献很大，为什么中国革命不由农民领导？”施小妹马上直截了当地回答他：“对这个问题搞不通，我看你是假的，你的真心是要资产阶级来领导！”几句话说得那个学员哑口无言。另一个工商业者听了她的报告后说：“现在我对工人阶级的领导才感到口服心服了。”
    施小妹本是文盲，在六十岁、上海解放那年她才开始学文化，现在已经能够写简单的讲稿，阅读报纸和一些通俗读物了。她每天至少要读半小时报纸和收听新闻广播。当她知道右派分子在利用共产党整风的机会向党和社会主义事业猖狂进攻的时候，她再也忍不住了，就向她所在的街道政府办事处表示：右派分子这样攻击党，我们工人应当讲话。于是，她就日日夜夜地到处演讲革命故事，叫人们不要被右派分子的谎话所蒙蔽。
    施小妹在历次政治运动中，都是党的政策的积极的宣传者和鼓动者。她喜欢向人说：像我这样没儿没女的人，在旧社会老早就饿死了。我要用自己的经历教育年青一代热爱党热爱新社会。当她两年前从上海国棉六厂退休以后，出外作报告就更经常了。1952年到现在，她已经做了四百三十次报告，听过她报告的人有六十多万人次。“革命妈妈施小妹”的名字在上海的工厂、学校中几乎是尽人皆知。
