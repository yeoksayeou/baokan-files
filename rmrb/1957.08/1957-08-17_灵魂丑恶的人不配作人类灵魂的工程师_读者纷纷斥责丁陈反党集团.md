Those with Ugly Souls Are Unworthy of Being Engineers of Human Souls
Readers Denounce the Ding Chen Anti-Party Clique

(Reported by this newspaper) After this newspaper published the news on August 7 about the literary and art circles attacking the Ding Ling Chen Qixia anti-Party clique, the broad masses sent telegrams and letters to the editorial department of this newspaper and the Party Group of the Chinese Writers Association, supporting this struggle to safeguard the socialist literary and art cause and the unity of literary and art circles. They denounced the conspiracies of the Ding Chen anti-Party clique with anger, demanding that they thoroughly and completely confess their criminal activities to the Party and the people. Some readers also exposed the criminal words and deeds of the Ding Chen anti-Party clique in their letters. The following are excerpts from these telegrams and letters.

The Chinese Writers Association received a telegram from the Guangzhou branch: "The Ding Ling Chen Qixia anti-Party clique, during the Party's rectification campaign, made a comeback, conspiring and colluding with right-wing elements, acting in concert from within and without, and launching a rampant attack on the Party. Our association members are extremely indignant upon hearing this news. We have convened a general meeting of all members staying in Guangzhou to unanimously denounce them and firmly express: We support the conclusions and handling of the enlarged meeting of the Party Group of the Chinese Writers Association in 1955 regarding the Ding Chen anti-Party clique, draw a clear political and ideological line between ourselves and the Ding Chen group's anti-Party elements, heighten our vigilance, strengthen our unity, and continue this struggle to defend the socialist literary and art cause and the Party's principles. We demand that you order the anti-Party elements Ding Ling, Chen Ming, etc., who are still stubbornly resisting, to make a thorough confession, and we will not cease fighting until complete victory is achieved." The famous translator Cao Jinghua wrote: "Before the People's Congress, I was hospitalized due to acute pneumonia and was unable to be discharged until the congress closed. Recently, I was transferred from a hospital in the city to the Xiaotangshan Sanatorium for post-pneumonia treatment. Therefore, I could not return to the city to participate in the anti-Rightist struggle, which was of profound political educational significance, convened by the Party Group of the Writers Association, and I deeply regret this. A few days ago, I received the fifth and sixth enlarged meeting records issued by the Party Group of the Writers Association, which were forwarded by my family, and then I read the news in various newspapers about Ding and Chen's anti-Party activities. I express my extreme indignation, and I wholeheartedly support this timely and necessary anti-Rightist struggle led by the Party. I believe that through this struggle, the national literary and art circles will achieve new unity, creating better conditions for the prosperity of literature and art." The Chinese People Will Never Tolerate the Anti-Party Activities of the Ding Chen Group

Yang Yin, a student in the Philosophy Department of the People's University of China, wrote, "I firmly support this just struggle conducted by the Writers Association to defend the socialist literary cause. Ding Ling, Chen Qixia, and others were once regarded as 'engineers of human souls.' We respected them, loved them, and placed all our hopes on them. But their faces are so ugly! This cannot but make us feel extremely heartbroken and extremely angry. Ding Ling, Chen Qixia, and others, no matter how talented they are as writers, if they want to betray the proletariat and betray the people, we will eliminate them without any regret. Ding, Chen, and others, don't show off your power. Let me tell you, without you, socialist literature will never decline or stagnate. If you want to leave this team, please do so!" Wei Qiming, a cadre of the Hunan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative Cadre School in Changsha, wrote, "Ding Ling, under the guise of a left-wing writer, engaged in anti-Party and anti-socialist literary and art activities behind the scenes. This is intolerable to every honest and conscientious Chinese person." Gu Yunfei from Hefei Seventh Middle School in Anhui wrote, "I demand that the literary ranks must not contain traitors to the people and the Party, and the literary ranks must be purified. I am an ordinary student, an ordinary citizen. Ding Ling, you must look down on my criticism because you are very arrogant. But I want to say, I love the Communist Party of China and will always follow the Communist Party. When you come to oppose the Party and attack the Party, we must defend the Party, defend socialism, and never let your dreamed 'Hungarian incident' reoccur in China." Wang Jian, a draftsman at the Mechanical Design Company of the Ministry of Textile Industry, wrote, "In my capacity as a member of the Communist Youth League and a cadre of a state organ, I warn Ding Ling to make a thorough confession to the people as soon as possible. There are two paths for her to choose: to deny it or to confess to the people, transform herself, start anew, and pass this socialist test? Anyway, we will not cease fighting until complete victory is achieved."

Children Question Chen Qixia
Who Will the Six Bullets Kill?

Wang Changyi from the Central Primary School in Fanjiadian District, Changchun City, wrote, "I was chatting happily with several children who, like close sisters, enjoy scholarships to study because they have no homes. The postman put the newspaper on the table, and it was immediately snatched away. Suddenly, a child shouted: 'Oh no! Ding Ling is also anti-Party?' Everyone was stunned for a moment. Then everyone wanted to read it. In order for everyone to know as soon as possible, I read it to them. As I read, my eyes were blazing with anger. As everyone listened, their little eyes were wide open, and their little fists were clenched tightly. When I read Chen Qixia's words, 'I have a pistol with seven bullets, and I will use the last one to kill myself,' the youngest Wu Guilan banged the table and jumped up: 'Who is he going to kill with the other six?' Zhang Yaxian grabbed the chance to say: 'Is he going to kill the Party leaders and overthrow the Communist Party, so that we homeless children will be beaten and killed?' Ding Ling, listen calmly to the voices of the children!" Socialist College Students Will Never Follow Anti-Party Elements

Han Yaojun, a student in the Marxist-Leninist Research Class at the People's University of China, wrote that Ding Ling swore an oath to the martyrs in "A Real Man's Life," but comparing it to her current criminal activities, what value does her oath have? Isn't it making the martyrs suffer a great humiliation? We hope that Ding Ling will compare what she is doing now with her previous oath. What face does she have to attack the Party rampantly? What reason does she have not to repent and start anew, honestly confess, and return to the right path. Gao Rengqing from Beijing Institute of Aeronautics wrote, I want to demand in my capacity as a fellow villager of Ding Ling that Ding Ling must confess all her criminal activities to the Party and the people of the whole country completely, thoroughly, and cleanly. If she stubbornly resists to the end, the Party and the people of the whole country, especially the old folks in her hometown of Hunan, will never agree. Hua Ping, a student in the History Department of Beijing Normal University, wrote, Ding Ling and Ai Qing are writers I have always respected. Ding Ling's "The Sun Shines on the Sanggan River" has won international reputation. But she has serious bourgeois personal desires. She did not take this honor as a signal to urge herself to further serve the people, but instead used it as a stepping stone to oppose the Party's leadership and pursue personal fame and gain. The "one book theory" she vigorously promoted has a seriously adverse effect on the people's literary cause. The exposure of the facts of the Ding and Chen anti-Party clique eloquently illustrates that a people's writer—an engineer of human souls—must first have a truly pure soul loyal to the people and loyal to the Party. No matter how brilliant and skilled one's writing techniques are, if one uses one's creation as a ladder to climb higher and ask the people for higher positions and greater benefits, one will inevitably be spurned by the people.

Ding Ling Poisons Young People, Saying the Literary and Art Circles Are Terrible

Wang Baojiang, a freshman in the History Department of Beijing Normal University, revealed some of Ding Ling's anti-Party and anti-socialist right-wing remarks in a letter. "On April 7 this year, the school's literary society decided to visit Ding Ling. The result of the visit was very disappointing. She spread many remarks expressing dissatisfaction with the literary and art circles. The main content of the conversation is revealed as follows:

1. Ding Ling's views on the current situation of the literary and art circles and the policy of 'letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend' are most prominently expressed in dissatisfaction and slander, almost describing it as a complete darkness. She believes that since liberation, the literary world has only focused on some low-quality and speculative literary reports and works to meet deadlines, and most of those who engage in these are young people. As for high-quality works with large volume, there are none. She did not make clear what caused this, but she exposed her hatred and dissatisfaction with the current situation, believing that it was terrible and dissatisfied with the current literature serving socialism. When talking about Chen Dengke's erroneous yellow works, she only said that Chen Dengke had no experience of intellectual love life and could not write such works, so he failed. She did not mention the Marxist-Leninist guiding principles and the socialist realism principles of 'letting a hundred flowers bloom.' Ding Ling also thought that Hu Feng's 'literary theory' was no problem when it was put forward in the contention, and so was Xiao Yemu's 'Between Us Husband and Wife.' From this, it can be seen that Ding Ling has extremely serious revisionist views in her thoughts. May I ask, to college freshmen, not even talking about the most basic things of Marxism-Leninism and the Party's literary and art policy, only saying 'terrible' and 'the level of the literary and art circles is low,' what is her intention?

2. Ding Ling mentioned Ai Qing the most in the conversation, seemingly having a very close relationship. Occasionally, she mentioned Feng Xuefeng, talking a little bit hesitantly. She covered up Chen Qixia's problems, praising Chen a lot, saying that he had resigned from all his positions. She did not mention why or what he was doing. She said Chen was smart, capable, and highly skilled, implying that he was excluded. When talking about the Hu Feng incident, she seemed to have no disgust for Hu Feng, remaining silent about Hu being a counter-revolutionary, only saying that there were differences in views and that Hu Feng, Lu Ling, and others were capable. This has a very bad influence."

In addition, two students from the Chinese Department of Beijing Normal University, Liu Weili and Zhang Yongchang, who had visited Ding Ling, revealed in a letter: Ding Ling once said: "Hu Feng's statement of 'there is life everywhere' has its merits. There are also struggles in schools now. He said this at the wrong time. If he had said it during the 'blooming' and 'contending' period, he would not have been imprisoned."

From these revelations, it is not difficult to see how Ding Ling opposes the guiding role of Marxist-Leninist theory in literary creation, how she opposes the Party's leadership in literature and art, how she slanders the literary and art circles, and how she uses her poisonous remarks to poison young people. Only by thoroughly defeating the Ding Chen anti-Party clique can we eliminate the toxins and harmful influences they have spread in the literary and art circles and among the broad masses.

    灵魂丑恶的人不配作人类灵魂的工程师
    读者纷纷斥责丁陈反党集团
    本报讯  8月7日本报发表了文艺界攻破丁玲陈企霞反党集团的消息后，广大群众分别打电报、写信给本报编辑部和中国作家协会党组，拥护这场维护社会主义文艺事业和维护文艺界的团结的斗争。他们以愤怒的心情斥责丁陈反党集团的阴谋活动，要他们彻底地、全部地向党向人民交代他们的罪恶活动。有的读者也在来信中揭发丁陈反党集团的罪恶言行。下面摘要发表这些来电、来信。
    中国作家协会收到广州分会来电：“丁玲陈企霞反党集团，在党整风期间，卷土重来，阴谋勾结右派分子，里应外合，向党猖狂进攻，我会同人闻讯之下，甚为愤慨。兹经召开留穗会员全体大会，一致声讨，并坚决表示：拥护1955年中国作协党组扩大会议关于丁陈反党集团的结论和处理，与丁陈集团反党分子划清政治上思想上的界限，提高警惕，加强团结，继续进行这场保卫社会主义文艺事业和党的原则的斗争。对尚图顽抗的反党分子丁玲、陈明等，要求你们责成他们作出彻底交代，不获全胜，决不收兵。”著名翻译家曹靖华来信：“在人代会前，我就因急性肺炎进了医院，直到人代会闭幕还未能出院。近又由城内医院转入小汤山疗养院，作肺炎善后医治。因此，作协党组所召开的具有深刻政治教育意义的反右斗争，我就不能回城参加，深感遗憾。前日收到家中转来的作协党组所发第五、六次扩大会议记录，继又读到各报发表丁、陈反党活动消息，我表示十分愤慨，我衷心拥护党所领导的这一及时而必要的反右斗争。我相信通过这一斗争，全国文艺界将达到新的团结，为文艺繁荣创造更好的条件。”中国人民决不能容忍丁陈集团的反党活动
    中国人民大学哲学系学生杨殷来信说，“我坚决支持作协为保卫社会主义文学事业而进行的这一正义斗争。丁玲、陈企霞这些人，过去被当作‘人类灵魂的工程师’，我们尊敬他们，爱他们，对他们寄予满腔希望。可是他们的面目竟如此之丑恶！这不能不使我们感到极大的痛心，也感到极大的愤怒。丁玲、陈企霞这些人，不管他们作为一个作家有多么大的才能，如果他们要背叛无产阶级，背叛人民大众，我们是会毫不惋惜地将他们清除出去的。丁、陈等不必耍威风，告诉你们，没有你们这些人，社会主义文学决不会衰萎，决不会停滞不前，你们要离开这个队伍，请便吧！”长沙市湖南省供销合作社干部学校魏启明来信：“丁玲打着左派作家的招牌，背地里从事反党反社会主义文艺事业的活动，这是我们每个正直的有良心的中国人民所不能容忍的。”安徽合肥市第七中学顾云飞来信：“我要求在文学队伍里，一定不能存在着人民和党的背叛者，一定要把文学队伍搞纯洁。我是一个普通的学生，普通的公民，丁玲，你一定看不起我的批评，因为你很骄傲。但是，我要说，我爱中国共产党，永远跟着共产党走。当你来反对党进攻党时，我们要保卫党，保卫社会主义，决不让你们所梦想的‘匈牙利事件’在中国重演。”纺织工业部机械设计公司描图员王健来信：“我以一个共青团员和国家机关干部的身份警告丁玲，要她早日向人民作彻底的交代，面临着两条路让她自己选择，是抵赖呢，还是向人民认罪，改造自己，重新作人，过社会主义这一关？反正我们是不获全胜，决不收兵。”
    孩子们质问陈企霞
    六颗子弹要打死谁
    长春市范家店区中心小学王长亿来信说：“我正在和几个像亲姐妹一样的没有家的享受助学金念书的孩子欢欢乐乐的闲谈，邮递员把报纸往桌子上一放，马上就被大家抢没了。忽然一个孩子喊起来：‘唉呀！丁玲怎么还反党了呢？’一时大家都楞住了，刹时你也要看，他也要看，为了大家早知道，我就读给他们听，我读着读着，眼里直冒火花，大家听着听着，小眼睛都瞪得滚圆，小拳头都捏得紧紧的。当读到陈企霞说的‘我有一支手枪，有七粒子弹，留最后一粒打死自己’的话时，最小的吴桂兰使劲一敲桌子跳了起来：‘那六颗他要打死谁？’张亚先抢着说：‘难道要打死党的领导者，要推翻共产党，让我们这些没家的孩子去挨打送命吗？’丁玲，你冷静地听听孩子们的声音吧！”社会主义的大学生决不跟反党分子走
    中国人民大学马列主义研究班韩耀军来信说，丁玲在“一个真实人的一生”里是向烈士发过誓的，可是与她现在的罪恶活动两相对照，她的誓言有什么价值呢，岂不是使烈士遭到奇耻大辱？我们希望丁玲把自己现在的所作所为和从前的誓言对照一下，还有什么脸向党猖狂进攻，还有什么理由不肯悔过自新，老老实实交代，重归正路。北京航空学院高仍清来信说，我要以一个丁玲同乡的身份坚决要求丁玲必需把她的一切罪恶活动全部、彻底、干净地向党和全国人民老老实实地交代。如果顽抗到底，党和全国人民，尤其是她湖南家乡的老百姓是决不答应的。北京师范大学历史系学生华平来信说，丁玲、艾青是我向来尊敬的作家。丁玲的“太阳照在桑乾河上”获得了国际声誉。但她有严重的资产阶级个人欲望，没有把这荣誉作为督促自己更进一步为人民的信号，反而把它作为反对党的领导、追求个人名利的阶石。她大肆宣扬的“一本书主义”对人民的文学事业有着严重的不良影响。通过揭露丁、陈反党集团的事实，雄辩地说明了一个人民的作家——人类灵魂的工程师，首先自己要有真正的忠于人民忠于党的纯洁的灵魂。不论自己有如何高明熟练的写作技巧，如果把自己的创作作为向上爬向人民要更高的职位更大的待遇的阶梯的作家，必然会遭到人民的唾弃。
    丁玲向青年人放毒把文艺界说成糟得很
    北京师范大学历史系一年级学生王葆江来信中揭发了丁玲的一些反党反社会主义的右派言行。“今年4月7日，学校的文艺社决定了要访问丁玲。访问的结果很失望，她传播了许多对文艺界不满的言论。谈话主要内容揭露如下：
    一、丁玲对当前文艺界状况及‘百家争鸣、百花齐放’政策的看法，最突出的情绪是不满和诬蔑，几乎说成漆黑一团。她认为文坛上解放后只重于一些质量不高带有投机性的文学报道，赶任务的作品，而搞这些的大部分是年青人，至于大部头的质量较高的作品则没有。是什么原因造成的，她没有说清楚，但是暴露了她对现状有仇恨，不满意，认为糟得很，对当前文学为社会主义服务不满意。谈到陈登科的错误的黄色作品时，她只说陈登科没有知识分子的爱情生活经验，不能写这类作品，所以失败了，根本不提‘百家争鸣’的马列主义指导原则、社会主义现实主义原则。丁玲还以为胡风的‘文艺理论’在争鸣中提出就没有问题，萧也牧的‘我们夫妇之间’也是如此。由此看来，丁玲思想上有极其严重的修正主义的观点的。试问对大学一、二年级学生连马列主义和党的文艺方针的最基本的东西都不谈，只说‘糟’，  ‘文艺界水平低’，居心何在？
    二、丁玲谈话中提到艾青最多，似乎关系很密。偶尔涉及冯雪峰，吞吞吐吐谈了一点。对陈企霞的问题是掩护，表扬了陈一顿，说他辞去了所有职务，为什么，不提，在搞些什么，也不提，说陈聪明能干，有水平，言下之意是被排斥出去的。谈到胡风事件，似乎对胡风没有讨厌情绪，闭口不谈胡是反革命，只说是看法有分歧，说胡风、路翎等人有本事。这一点影响很坏。”
    另有两位曾经访问过丁玲的北京师范大学中文系学生刘唯力、张永昌来信中揭发：丁玲曾说：“胡风的‘那里都有生活’的说法有对的地方，现在学校里也有斗争。他这句话说的不是时候，若在‘鸣’‘放’期间说，是不会被关起来的”。
    从这些揭发，不难看出，丁玲是如何的反对马列主义理论对文艺创作的指导作用，如何反对党对文艺的领导，如何对文艺界进行污蔑，如何用她那有毒的言论毒害青年，只有彻底打垮丁陈反党集团，才能清除他们在文艺界和广大群众中所散布的毒素和有害影响。
