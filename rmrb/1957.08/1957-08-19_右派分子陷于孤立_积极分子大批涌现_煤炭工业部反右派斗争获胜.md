    Rightists Isolated, Activists Emerge in Large Numbers
    Ministry of Coal Industry Wins Anti-Rightist Struggle

    (Our report) The Ministry of Coal Industry has fully launched its anti-Rightist struggle. The once rampant Rightists in the various bureaus, offices, institutes, and schools under the ministry have been completely isolated under the rational struggle of the broad masses.

    Wang Fuxian, a fourth-grade engineer from the Production Department, openly advocated for the abolition of the Party's leadership over the coal mining industry, unreasonably questioning, "When the revolution had not yet succeeded, the Party's leadership was necessary. Now that the revolution has succeeded, is the Party's leadership still needed? Isn't administrative leadership enough?" He maliciously belittled the Party's leading role, saying, "In my opinion, the Communist Party is not much different from other parties. There is nothing special about it. The Kuomintang, the Communist Party, and all secret societies are all like this, trying to win people over and saying they are good." At nine consecutive debate meetings, everyone refuted Wang Fuxian's vicious slander with many specific facts. Shao Keren, a secretary from the Production Department, questioned Wang Fuxian, "Isn't it a fact that among the thirty-two section chiefs in the four departments of finance, planning, supply and production in our ministry, only fourteen are Party members, and the rest are all non-Party members?"

    The Beijing Coal Mine Design Institute under the ministry was one of the focal points of the Rightists' attacks. The Beijing Coal Mine Design Institute's Rectification Leadership Group organized four battlefields to counterattack, based on the four aspects of the Rightists' attack on the Party. Zhang Ke, a Rightist from the Industrial Construction Section, ignited the first fire in the institute with his big-character poster "Save the Constitution." During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, Zhang Ke was interrogated by the government according to law for his large amount of reactionary remarks, serious technical accidents, and concealment of disassembled firearms at home. Later, he was "educated and released" by the government. After his release, he was fully paid his salary during the interrogation period, and his salary was raised a level during last year's wage reform. However, Zhang Ke repaid kindness with malice, maliciously distorting facts and creating false files in the big-character poster, insisting that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries "destroyed the Constitution" and that "all materials were purely fictitious," attempting to incite other targets of the suppression to overturn the verdict. After the big-character poster was issued, it aroused "sympathy" and "protest" from some of the masses who did not know the truth. However, after the Rectification Leadership Group announced Zhang Ke's entire file and held four consecutive large-scale debate meetings, Zhang Ke's ugly face was completely exposed, and the masses who had been deceived turned around and moved closer to the Party. Gu Changjiang, who had always supported Zhang Ke, said, "I was also confused by his 'innocent' trial. I changed my incorrect view."

    At the dozen or so debate meetings at the Coal Industry Publishing House, the activities of the Rightist Zhao Shiyun to change the leadership of the publishing industry were refuted. Zhao Shiyun carried out activities everywhere during the blooming and contending, inciting the masses to be dissatisfied with the Party, completely negating the achievements of the publishing house, advocating the establishment of a privately-owned "publishing company" or "association company," advocating no Party leadership, and not being restricted by the national personnel system, with editors being "freely combined." This fallacy was refuted by many comrades. Liao Wenjin said that the publishing house is a weapon of class struggle, and political work is the soul of the publishing industry. Only by solving the problem of political leadership can the fundamental problem of the publishing house be solved. Can the fundamental problem of the publishing house be solved correctly without the Party's leadership? Many comrades pointed out that before liberation, only two or three books related to the coal industry were published in our country, but from 1951 to June 1957, more than 520 professional books related to coal, geology, surveying, well construction, and coal mining were published, basically meeting the needs of coal industry production and construction and talent cultivation. Weren't these achievements made under the leadership of the Party?

    In the fierce debates, various units distinguished right from wrong and produced a large number of activists. The number of activists at the Beijing Coal Mine Design Institute has increased from the original 16% to 30%, and the middle elements have begun to get involved in the struggle, isolating the Rightists. At present, some Rightists have begun to surrender, some are still stubbornly resisting, and some are looking for "tricks" for false self-criticism in an attempt to muddle through. The leaders of the Ministry of Coal are actively preparing to launch a larger-scale rational struggle in the coming days.

### 右派分子陷于孤立　积极分子大批涌现  煤炭工业部反右派斗争获胜

    右派分子陷于孤立　积极分子大批涌现
    煤炭工业部反右派斗争获胜
    本报讯　煤炭工业部反右派斗争已全面展开。这个部所属各局、室、院、校曾猖狂一时的右派分子在广大群众说理斗争下，已完全陷于孤立。
    生产司的右派分子王复先是四级工程师，他公开主张取消党对煤矿工业的领导，无理质问：“革命没有胜利时党的领导是必要的。现在革命胜利了是否需要党的领导？只要行政领导不就行了吗？”他恶意贬低党的领导作用说：“共产党我看和其他党派差不了多少，没有什么特别的地方，国民党、共产党、一切会道门都是这样拉拢人们，都说自己好。”在连续召开的九次辩论会上，大家用许多具体事实驳斥了王复先的恶毒谰言。生产司秘书邵可人质问王复先说：“我们部里财务、计划、供产和生产四个司局三十二个科长中仅有党员十四名，其余都是非党员担任，难道不是事实吗？”
    这个部所属北京煤矿设计院是右派分子进攻的重点之一。北京煤矿设计院整风领导小组，根据右派分子向党进攻的四个方面，分别组织了四个战场反击。工建科右派分子张科“救救宪法”的大字报在全院点起了第一把火。张科在肃反时，曾因有大量反动言论、严重的技术事故及隐瞒家中拆卸手枪问题，被政府依法审讯过，后经政府“教育释放”。释放后，又全部发给了他被审讯期间的薪水，去年工资改革时又提了一级。但张科却以怨报德，在大字报中恶意歪曲事实，制造了假档案，硬说肃反“破坏了宪法”、“一切材料纯属虚构”，企图煽动其他肃反对象一起翻案。大字报发出后，曾引起一些不明真相的群众“同情”和“抗议”。可是，整风领导小组公布了张科的全部档案，连续召开了四次大辩论会后，张科的丑恶面目完全被揭穿了，曾经受骗的群众纷纷转变过来，向党靠拢。过去一直支持张科的顾长江说：“我也给他‘无罪’受审所迷糊了，我改变我的不正确的看法”。
    在煤炭工业出版社的十几次辩论会上，驳斥了右派分子赵石耘企图改变出版事业领导的活动。赵石耘在鸣放中到处进行活动，煽动群众对党不满，一笔抹杀出版社的成绩，主张成立私营企业性质的“出版公司”或“同人公司”，主张不要党的领导，不受国家人事制度的限制，编辑“自由组合”。这种谬论遭到许多同志的驳斥。廖文锦说，出版社是阶级斗争的武器，政治工作是出版事业的灵魂，只有解决了政治领导问题才能解决出版社的根本问题。难道没有党的领导能正确解决出版社的根本问题吗？许多同志指出：解放以前我国只出版了两三本有关煤炭工业的书籍，可是从1951年起到1957年6月为止，就出版了有关煤炭、地质、测量、建井、采煤等专业书籍五百二十多种，基本上满足了煤炭工业生产建设与培养人才的需要。难道这些成绩不是在党的领导下取得的吗？
    各单位在激烈的争论中明辨了是非，涌现了大批积极分子。北京煤矿设计院的积极分子已由原来的16％上升到30％，中间分子开始卷入斗争，右派分子被孤立起来。目前右派分子有的已经开始投降，有的还在顽抗，有的找假检讨的“窍门”，企图蒙混过关。煤炭部领导上正积极准备，日内将展开更大规模的说理斗争。
