Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, August 13th: Romania's streamlining of Party and government organizations at the state, county, and city levels, which began in April and May of this year, is now basically complete.

During the streamlining process, some units were merged and eliminated, and the number of staff in government offices was greatly reduced. For example, the People's Congress of one state streamlined its twenty-six subordinate units into eighteen, reducing staff by 40%. The streamlined personnel have all been properly resettled. They have been assigned to work in grassroots units or to participate in industrial and agricultural production.

After the organizational adjustments, the relationship between leading cadres and the masses has become closer. For example, the county Party committee secretaries and members now directly lead the work of township-level Party organizations. At the same time, due to attention being paid to investigation and research in government work, overcoming bureaucracy, and strengthening work planning, the work efficiency and quality of work of Party and government organizations at all levels have improved compared to the past.

The decision to streamline central-level Party and government organizations was announced in March of this year. At that time, it was decided to merge the twenty-eight ministries of the Council of Ministers into fifteen, and the number of staff would be reduced accordingly. In recent months, central-level organizations have also been streamlining their organizations.

    提高工作效率　节约行政开支
    罗马尼亚精简机构
    据新华社布加勒斯特13日电 罗马尼亚从今年4、5月间开始的精简州、县、市各级党、政机构的工作，目前已经基本结束。
    在精简机构过程中，合并和取消了一些单位，机关工作人员大大减少了。有的州人民会议把所属的二十六个单位精简为十八个，工作人员减少了40％。被精简的人员都得到了适当的安置。他们分别被派到基层单位工作，或者参加工农业生产。
    机构调整以后，领导干部同群众的关系密切了。如目前工人党县委书记和委员就直接领导乡一级党组织的工作。同时由于在机关工作中注意了调查研究，克服了文牍主义，加强了工作的计划性等等，各级党政机构的工作效率和工作质量都比过去提高了。
    精简中央一级党、政机构的决定是在今年3月间宣布的。当时决定把部长会议的二十八个部合并为十五个部，工作人员也要相应减少。近几个月来，中央一级的机关也进行了精简机构的工作。
