Only the Communist Party Can Truly Protect Scientists
Zhao Jiuzhang, Director of the Institute of Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences

Recently, at a symposium convened by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, scientists rigorously criticized the anti-Party and anti-socialist scientific program put forward by rightists in the China Democratic League, and thoroughly exposed the anti-Party criminal activities of Zeng Zhaolun and Qian Weichang. This symposium has given me another profound education in the class struggle against the rightists.

Chinese scientists who have experienced difficult times in the old society deeply feel from their own experiences that only in the new China, under the Party's care and protection, can Chinese scientists be truly protected. Taking my personal experience as an example: Before liberation, meteorological data was extremely insufficient, but it was still controlled by a few reactionary Kuomintang air force meteorological personnel, becoming their monopolized private property. They themselves could not conduct research, and they also prevented others from using this data for research. Before liberation, it was difficult to establish a weather analysis research office in the Meteorological Research Institute due to the above reasons.

After liberation, the situation was very different. Through the cooperation between the Academy of Sciences and the Central Meteorological Bureau over the past few years, scientific research and China's meteorological operations have been organically linked. Currently, the Central Meteorological Bureau uses teletypewriters to transmit important domestic and worldwide meteorological data to our institute every day for our weather analysis; the Meteorological Bureau also prepares to collect special foreign meteorological broadcasts at our request for the needs of scientific research. This close cooperative relationship was unimaginable in the old society and is not easy to achieve in capitalist countries. The above is just one example I have encountered. There are many examples of good cooperation between many institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and production organizations. This fully proves that the rightists' claim that "data is kept too strictly confidential... leading to academic monopoly and private ownership of results" is a completely unfounded lie.

Regarding the issue of research assistants, before 1954, due to the recent reorganization of departments and colleges, the number of university graduates was limited, so the number assigned to the Academy of Sciences was not large; however, after 1955, the situation gradually improved. Taking meteorology students as an example: Peking University, Nanjing University's meteorology major, and other meteorological vocational schools have not only trained many high-quality cadres in recent years, who were assigned to meteorological bureau stations, but also cultivated a group of promising young people for scientific research. Taking 1954 as an example, there were fewer university graduates that year, and our institute was only assigned six meteorological vocational school graduates. After several years of training, these graduates can not only complete the tasks assigned by their mentors, but some have also produced good research papers. The allocation of college students in 1955 and 1956 has improved year by year. In the future, with the continuous improvement of teaching in universities, a large number of excellent young assistants will be cultivated. Therefore, the problem in the future is not the lack of assistants for scientists, but how older scientists can more effectively bring out the younger generation. From this example, it also powerfully illustrates that the rightists' claim about the lack of assistants is nonsense.

Let's talk about the time issue. After liberation, because scientists participated in a series of social movements such as land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, ideological reform, and the Three-Anti Campaign, they criticized the feudal, reactionary, and pro-American ideas we brought from the old society, and accepted Marxism-Leninism and the materialistic worldview, which significantly improved our thinking. Although this took some time, I think these years of political study are very important for us; without the foundation of these years of study and ideological reform, I am afraid that more scientists would have been deceived by the rightists in this anti-rightist movement. Therefore, this time cannot be considered a waste. In the future, we also need to better utilize our time for theoretical study, and improve our ideological level through combining physical labor and practical experience in rural areas and factories.

In terms of administrative work, since the Party proposed at the intellectuals' conference to guarantee scientists five-sixths of their time for scientific research, the Academy of Sciences leadership has equipped each institute with a complete set of administrative assistants; under the leadership of the administrative deputy director, they have assisted in handling many daily administrative and office affairs, and conducted ideological leadership for the staff, so that scientific workers responsible for administrative leadership can free themselves from tedious administrative work, and under normal circumstances, can devote close to five-sixths of their time to research work. This is very different from the situation before 1954 when each institute was not equipped with an administrative deputy director. If we consider the current scale of our institute and the breadth of research, without the leadership of the Party, I cannot imagine how the institute's work could be put on track; at the same time, I can still have ample time to conduct scientific research.

Based on the above facts, it is sufficient to prove that the "protecting scientists" slogan put forward by the rightists is a malicious slander against the Party. Chinese scientific workers are only meticulously cared for in the new society, under the care of the Party. Through this symposium of the Academy of Sciences, I deeply feel that we must always rely on the Party, never relax our political study and ideological reform, and wash away the right-leaning thoughts remaining in our minds. Only in this way can we avoid losing our way in great storms, and can we firmly struggle for the socialist scientific cause.

    只有共产党才能真正保护科学家
    中国科学院地球物理研究所所长　赵九章
    最近，在中国科学院所召集的座谈会上，科学家们对民盟右派分子所提出来的反党反社会主义的科学纲领，进行了严正的批判；对曾昭抡、钱伟长的反党罪恶活动，作了彻底的揭发。通过这一次座谈会，使我在反右派的阶级斗争中，又受了一次深刻的教育。
    凡是在旧社会里经历过一段艰苦岁月的中国科学家们，从自己亲身的感受里，都会深切感到只有在新中国，在党的多方关怀和爱护下，中国科学家才能真正受到保护。以我个人的经历为例：解放前气象资料是极为不够的，但是还被少数反动国民党空军气象人员所把持，成为这些人垄断的私产，他们自己既不能做研究，也阻碍了别人利用这些资料来做研究。解放前气象研究所要筹设一个天气分析研究室，由于以上的原因就很难实现。
    解放后，情形就大不相同了。通过几年来科学院和中央气象局的合作，使科学研究与中国气象业务有机地联系起来。目前中央气象局利用电传打字机不但每天把国内及全世界重要气象资料传送到我所来，供我们作天气分析之用；气象局还应我们的要求，为了科学研究的需要，准备另外收集国外特殊的气象广播。这种紧密的合作关系，不但在旧社会里无法梦想，在资本主义国家里也不易办到。以上所举的不过是我所接触的实例之一，中国科学院许多研究所与生产机构配合得很好的事例还很多。由此可以充分证实，右派分子所说的“资料保密过严过死……造成学术垄断，成果私有”是完全不符合事实的谎言。
    关于研究助手问题，1954年以前，由于院系调整不久，大学毕业生人数有限，因此分配到科学院的人数不多；但1955年以后，情况就逐渐改善。以气象系学生为例：北大、南大气象专业同其他气象专科学校这几年来不但训练了不少质量较好的干部，分配到气象局所属台站，也为科学研究培养了一批有希望的青年。以1954年为例，那一年大学毕业生较少，我所只分配到六个气象专科毕业生，经过这几年的培养，这些毕业生不但可以完成导师所指定的工作，有的还做出了较好的研究论文。1955、1956年的大学生分配逐年都有所改善，今后随着高等学校教学工作的日益改进，优秀的青年助手会大量的培养出来。所以，今后的问题，不是科学家缺乏助手的问题，而是老科学家如何更有效地把青年一辈带出来。从这个例子来看，也有力地说明了右派分子关于缺乏助手的说法是无稽之谈。
    再谈时间问题。解放后，由于科学家参加了土改、镇反、思想改造、三反等一系列的社会运动，批判了我们从旧社会里带来的封建、反动、崇美等思想，接受了马列主义及唯物的宇宙观，使我们思想上有显著的提高。这虽然要用去一些时间，但我认为这几年的政治学习，对于我们是十分重要的；没有这几年的学习和思想改造的基础，在这次反右派运动中恐怕会有更多的科学家会被右派分子所迷惑。所以，这些时间不能算是浪费。今后我们还需要更好地运用我们理论学习的时间，在结合体力劳动和下乡下厂实际生活的锻炼中，来提高我们的思想水平。
    在行政工作方面，自从知识分子会议上党提出保证科学家以六分之五的时间从事科学研究业务以后，科学院领导为各所配备了整套的行政助手；在行政副所长领导下，协助处理了许多日常行政业务和事务工作，对工作人员进行了思想领导，使负责行政领导的科学工作者，从烦琐的行政工作中脱身出来，在一般情况下，可以以接近六分之五的时间来从事研究工作。这同1954年以前各所没有配备行政副所长的情况就大不相同了。如果以现在我所的规模和研究业务的广泛性而言，如果没有党的领导，我就无法想像怎么能把所的业务搞上轨道；同时我自己还能以充裕的时间来进行科学研究工作。
    根据以上的事实，足证右派分子所提出来的“保护科学家”的口号是对党的恶毒的诬蔑。中国科学工作者只有在新社会里，在党的关怀下，才受到无微不至的爱护。通过这一次科学院的座谈会，我深切感觉到，我们还必须时刻依靠党，时刻不放松我们的政治学习和思想改造，把残存于我们头脑里的右倾思想清洗掉。只有这样，我们才不致在大风大浪中迷失方向，才能坚定地为社会主义科学事业而奋斗。
