　  Shanxi Industrial Unions Launch Anti-Rightist Struggle
    (By Our Newspaper) Recently, the "Contending Garden," jointly published by the industrial unions of Shanxi Province, exposed the anti-Party and anti-socialist fallacies of Guo Wenquan of the Provincial Cultural Workers' Union and Shang Ying of the Provincial Electric Power Industry Union. Guo Wenquan proclaimed that "socialism has made it so that people cannot eat or dress," and that "a socialist system with a capitalist economy" should be implemented.

    Shang Ying, deputy director of the Electric Power Industry Union office, said that the current union chairmen, without exception, are all Communist Party members, deliberately arranged by the leadership and not democratically elected. Guo Wenquan also said that where there are Party members, there are contradictions, and he advocated "abolishing all Communist Party members nationwide, leaving only the Party Central Committee to guide the work." Workers in various systems are currently criticizing them.

　  山西各产业工会展开反右派斗争
    本报讯　最近，山西省各产业工会联合出刊的“争鸣园地”，揭发了省文化工作者工会郭文泉、省电业工会商英的反党反社会主义谬论。郭文泉宣称“社会主义弄得人们吃不上穿不上”，要实行“社会主义制度，资本主义经济”。
    电业工会办公室副主任商英，他说现在的工会主席那一个不是共产党员，都是领导有意识安排的，不是民主选举。郭文泉也说有党员存在就有矛盾，他主张“取消全国的共产党员，只留党中央指导工作”。各系统职工正对他们进行批判。
