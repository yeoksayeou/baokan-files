    Ministry of Labor Fully Launches Anti-Rightist Struggle
    Rightist Elements Isolated
    (Our Dispatch) The Ministry of Labor's anti-Rightist struggle has been fully launched. The Rightist elements in this ministry have been completely isolated under the reasoning struggle of the broad masses.
    The Protection Bureau countered the Rightist element Ye Huade's attack on the state cadre policy. In his speech attacking the Party, which was as long as 25,000 characters, Ye Huade viciously cursed "the Cadre Department is a Yama Temple," and distorted the Party's cadre policy as "not appointing people on their merits, but appointing people based on their worker-peasant background." He used this to provoke the relationship between cadres of worker-peasant origin and cadres of intellectual origin. He slandered the Party and League cadres of the Ministry of Labor as "receiving salaries based on their Party and League membership," and the leading cadres as "relying on history to eat." He even falsely accused Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on cadre work as "full of sectarian emotions," and he also wrote articles for the China Youth Daily to support Chu Anping's reactionary remarks. The broad masses refuted his fallacies with facts. Comrade Ma Jinsheng said: Comrade Shaoqi's instructions are fully in line with the current situation and the interests of the people of the whole country. It has greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of Party members and non-Party comrades to study diligently. But Ye Huade said that this report is full of sectarian emotions, which is a vicious distortion.
    The Wage Bureau and the Translation Office respectively countered the reactionary remarks of the Rightist elements Liang Shichang and Shi Xuemin, who were trying to provoke the relationship between the Party and the masses. Liang Shichang viciously said: "The style of the Party ruling the world is rampant," "New nepotism has emerged," "The Communist Party is the master, and the masses are the object of exploitation." He also provoked the relationship between leaders and those led among the masses, saying that leaders and those led are "two major groups." He used some reasonable differences in living conditions to incite the masses against leading cadres. Shi Xuemin also fired vicious arrows in provoking the relationship between the Party and the masses. He reversed black and white and said: "Now the Party regards Party members as sons, and non-Party masses as adopted sons, or it can be said to be a stepmother relationship, or a mother-in-law and daughter-in-law relationship," so that "the masses are not respected in personality."
    Many comrades refuted Liang Shichang's fallacy of "the Party ruling the world is rampant" with concrete facts. Everyone pointed out that Liang Shichang made a big fuss about the relationship between the Party and the masses in order to isolate the Party and destroy the Party, which we cannot allow. Comrade Tian Chunrun said that before liberation, as soon as he entered university, he was worried about unemployment after graduation. Now, as soon as he graduates, he is assigned work. Before liberation, prices rose 430 times in 1948 alone. Now prices are stable and people's lives are very stable. He said: It is absolutely impossible for Rightist elements to weaken the Party and destroy the Party through rectification.
    Everyone felt very angry about Shi Xuemin's slander that the Party is the "stepmother" of the masses. Xie Fengying said: Shi Xuemin received the Party's training in his early years and was sent to the Soviet Union to study. Soon he wavered and broke away from the revolution and worked as a capitalist in the Kuomintang-controlled area for more than ten years. After liberation, the Party was very generous to him, not pursuing the past, and giving him work to do. Today, he actually said such things. He is really ungrateful.
    The ministry also refuted the reactionary remarks of Liu Kunkai, deputy director of the Translation Office of the Training Bureau and a Rightist element, who slandered the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. Liu Kunkai said: "The suppression of counter-revolutionaries has gone too far." He spoke out for Hu Feng, saying, "Hu Feng is not a counter-revolutionary, only a little 'poisonous weed'." He also openly opposed the People's Daily editorial "What is the Reason for This?"
    In the face of truth, the Rightist elements in this ministry have begun to yield and confess their guilt, but some are still stubbornly resisting, or making false self-criticisms, trying to muddle through. In order to thoroughly defeat the attack of the Rightist elements, the Party organization of the Ministry of Labor is rectifying the ranks and continuing to deepen this struggle.

### 劳动部全面展开反右派斗争  右派分子陷于孤立

    劳动部全面展开反右派斗争
    右派分子陷于孤立
    本报讯  劳动部反右派斗争已全面展开。这个部的右派分子在广大群众的说理斗争下，已完全陷于孤立。
    保护局反击了右派分子叶华德对国家干部政策的攻击。叶华德在他长达二万五千字的向党进攻的发言中，恶毒咒骂“干部司是阎王殿”，歪曲党的干部政策“不是任人唯贤，而是任人唯工农成分”。以此来挑拨工农出身的干部和知识分子出身的干部的关系。他污蔑劳动部党团干部是“靠党团籍领薪水”，领导干部是“靠历史吃饭”。他甚至诬蔑刘少奇同志关于干部工作的报告“充满了宗派主义情绪”，他还给青年报写稿支持储安平的反动言论。广大群众纷纷用事实驳斥了他的这些谰言。马金生同志说：少奇同志的指示，是完全符合当前的形势和全国人民的利益的。它大大地鼓舞了党员和非党同志刻苦钻研的积极性。而叶华德却说这一报告充满了宗派主义情绪，这是一种恶毒的歪曲。
    工资局和编译室分别反击了右派分子梁世昌、施学民挑拨党群关系的反动言论。梁世昌恶毒地说：“党天下之风盛行”，“新的裙带风产生了”，“共产党是主人，群众是被利用的对象。”他还向群众挑拨领导与被领导的关系，说领导和被领导是“两大集团”，他利用生活待遇上的一些合理差别，来煽动群众反对领导干部。施学民在挑拨党群关系中也放了恶毒的箭。他颠倒黑白地说：“现在党对党员视为儿子，对非党群众以螟蛉子看待，也可以说是后母关系，也可以说是婆媳关系”，使“群众在人格上没有受到尊重”。
    许多同志以具体事实有力地驳斥了梁世昌的“党天下之风盛行”的谬论。大家都指出梁世昌在党群关系上大做文章，目的在于孤立党，搞垮党，这是我们不能容许的。田春润同志说，解放前他一入大学即担心着毕业后的失业，现在毕业即分配工作。解放前，1948年一年物价就涨了四百三十倍，现在物价稳定，人民生活非常安定；他说：右派分子要想通过整风削弱党搞垮党是绝对办不到的。
    大家对施学民诬蔑党是群众的“后母”感到非常气愤。谢凤英说：施学民早年就受到党的培养，送他到苏联去学习，不久他就动摇脱离了革命，回到国民党统治区做了十几年的资本家，解放后党对他很宽大，不究既往，而且给他工作做，今天他竟然说出这样话，真是忘恩负义。
    这个部还驳斥了培训局翻译室副主任右派分子刘坤闓污蔑肃反的反动言论。刘坤闓说：“肃反搞得过火了”。他为胡风喊冤，说“胡风不是反革命，只是一点‘毒草’”。他还公开反对人民日报“这是为什么”的社论。
    在真理面前，这个部的右派分子已开始屈服，低头认罪，但有的仍在顽强抵抗，或进行假检讨，企图蒙混过关。劳动部党组织为了彻底打垮右派分子的进攻，正在整顿队伍，继续深入这一斗争。
