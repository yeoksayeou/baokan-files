Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 1st - Wang Mingxun, alternate member of the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Director of the Mechanical Engineering Department of the Northeast Institute of Technology, has degenerated and deteriorated, colluding with bourgeois right-wingers to attack the Party.

At a forum on May 9th, right-wing elements in the Mechanical Engineering Department viciously "generaled" against Kang Minzhuang, the Party Secretary of the institute, and mobilized the masses to sign their names to attack the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. Wang Mingxun, as an alternate member of the Municipal Party Committee, also signed. When the signing teachers elected Wang Mingxun to "petition" the Municipal Party Committee, Wang was overjoyed, elated, and applauded his acceptance. In order to attack the Party in an organized manner, the right-wing elements planned to establish an "Extraordinary Committee" that would override the Party and administrative organizations. The Institute's Party Committee explicitly instructed Wang Mingxun not to agree to this organization and asked him and other Communist Party members to explain to the masses, but he did not implement the Party Committee's decision and told the right-wing elements that "the Party Committee is interfering with the activities of the central group." Wang Mingxun also met with Huang Oudong, First Secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee, along with the right-wing elements. The Institute's Party Committee instructed Wang Mingxun not to convey Huang Oudong's speech for the time being; otherwise, the speech draft must be reviewed by Huang Oudong himself. Wang Mingxun not only failed to implement this instruction from the Party Committee but also conveyed Huang Oudong's speech, and intentionally distorted and concealed certain important points. For example, Huang Oudong clearly answered the right-wing elements that he did not agree to the establishment of illegal organizations such as the "Extraordinary Committee," but Wang Mingxun did not convey this opinion to the masses and continued to incite the masses to establish an "Extraordinary Committee."

After the leadership of the central group of the Mechanical Engineering Department was usurped by the right-wing elements, the department's forum became a platform for slandering and reviling the Party, and the big-character posters became a tool for the right-wing elements to attack the Party. Wang Mingxun was the president of the big-character poster newspaper. He personally compiled and published articles by right-wing elements slandering the Party and also provided the right-wing elements with the next anti-Party plans. In order to encourage the right-wing elements, he also put forward slogans such as "Don't be afraid of going to jail for making revolution."

After the anti-rightist struggle began, Wang Mingxun encouraged the right-wing elements, saying, "Don't be discouraged." In order to prevent the disintegration of the right-wing group, he personally organized the right-wing group to form an alliance to defend each other and made two false self-criticisms. The masses were very angry at Wang Mingxun's false self-criticisms and unanimously demanded that he further explain the purpose of his reactionary activities.

### 公然发动群众攻击党委  王铭勋蜕化变质

    公然发动群众攻击党委
    王铭勋蜕化变质
    新华社沈阳1日电　中共沈阳市委候补委员、东北工学院机械系主任王铭勋蜕化变质，和资产阶级右派分子里应外合，向党进攻。
    机械系右派分子在5月9日的鸣放座谈会上恶毒地向院党委书记康敏庄“将军”，并发动群众签名攻击中共沈阳市委，身为市委候补委员的王铭勋也签了名。当签名的教师推选王铭勋去市委“请愿”时，王兴高采烈、得意忘形，鼓掌接受。右派分子为了有组织地向党进攻，曾策划成立一个凌驾党和行政组织之上的“非常委员会”，院党委明确指示王铭勋不能同意这个组织，并叫他和其他共产党员向群众解释，但他不执行党委的决定，并向右派分子说“党委干涉中心组活动”。王铭勋还和右派分子一起见了辽宁省委第一书记黄欧东。院党委曾指示王铭勋先不要传达黄欧东的讲话，否则传达讲话稿必须经黄欧东亲自看过。王铭勋不但不执行党委的这一指示，把黄欧东的讲话作了传达，并且在某些重要地方有意加以歪曲和隐瞒，如黄欧东明确回答右派分子不同意成立“非常委员会”等非法组织，但王铭勋没有向群众传达这个意见，继续煽动群众，要成立“非常委员会”。
    机械系中心组领导权被右派分子篡夺后，系的鸣放会成了污蔑党、谩骂党的讲坛，大字报成了右派分子向党进攻的工具。王铭勋是大字报社长，他亲手编发右派分子污蔑党的文章，还给右派分子提供下一步反党的计划。他为了鼓励右派分子，还提出“干革命不要怕坐牢”等口号。
    在反右派斗争展开后，王铭勋给右派分子打气说：“不要灰心泄气。”为了防止右派集团分崩离析，他又亲自组织右派集团订立攻守同盟，作了两次假检讨。群众对王铭勋的假检讨非常气愤，一致要求他对反动活动的目的作进一步交代。
