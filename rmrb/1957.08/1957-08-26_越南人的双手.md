　　The Hands of the Vietnamese People
　  Jiang Chengshu
    The documentary "Fragments of Vietnamese People's Life" is not long, but it leaves many vivid impressions, the strongest of which are the hands of the Vietnamese people.

    These are the hands that create a bright future for the motherland, the hands that create a beautiful life for themselves.

    The film takes you to the Cam Pha mining area, where you can see the hands of male and female miners on the layers of open-pit mines shimmering with dark light. The Vietnamese say that Cam Pha mine is like a pomelo, meaning that you only need to peel off the outermost skin. However, the abundant mineral resources will only show a smile and happily greet the pickaxes of their nurtured children after they are freed from the exploitation of the French colonists and returned to their own masters. Go to Haiphong Port, you can see the hands of the dockworkers, day and night, working diligently and happily back and forth on the docks of the motherland's largest port, loading thousands and tens of thousands of tons of cargo onto large ships, traveling across the oceans to foreign countries; or unloading those goods from afar. Arriving at Yi'an, a thrilling construction site scene unfolds before you. In the hands of construction workers, a brand-new power plant is about to be born. Many factories, pumping stations, and homes are waiting, waiting for the hands of construction workers and power plant workers to bring them light and heat!

    Going to the vast rural areas of the mountains and plains, you can see the calloused hands of farmers. Their hands are strong and powerful. In the days of drought, they put forward the resounding slogan: "Wring water out of the land!" Their hands have overcome natural disasters; in sunny days, you will also see the agile hands of the Thanh Hoa lads climbing a hundred feet high to cut coconuts, the light hands of the Bac Giang girls picking tangerines, and the well-known hands of the Phu Nghia villagers, both men and women, young and old, weaving delicate rattan products. They have lived on this land for generations, but what a long period of time mixed with blood and tears! When have their hands ever worked for themselves like today? When have their songs ever sung for their own lives like today?

    Arriving in Hanoi, you cannot help but be captivated by the skillful hands of the girls. They embroider such bright flowers, such beautiful mountains and rivers, and such lifelike figures on the paintings with colorful silk threads. If you were to say that they have embroidered the entire beautiful life, it would not be an exaggeration. Similarly, how can you not admire and thank the flower-planting hands of the people of Ngoc Ha Village? In that village of flowers, with its myriad of purples and reds, flowers bloom in all seasons. So many peonies, chrysanthemums, marigolds, and gladioli adorn life so charmingly!

    The hands of the Vietnamese people can work and learn culture. Look at those old men and old women, squinting their eyes and slowly moving their hands. What are they doing? They are learning to write. Each hand here may have only carried a hoe and spun thread all its life, and only after liberation did it become possible to pick up a completely unfamiliar pen.

    After watching this set of documentaries, what do you want to say? How can you not be as moved as I am by the hardworking hands of the Vietnamese people who create everything, and deeply believe that these thousands of hands will surely create a more joyful and prosperous life?

　　越南人的双手
　  江城树
    纪录片“越南人民生活片断”并不长，却留给人许多鲜明的印象，其中最强烈的，就是越南人的双手。
    这是为祖国创造灿烂的未来的双手，是为自己创造美好的生活的双手。
    影片把你带到锦普矿区，在那层层闪着乌光的露天矿上，你能看到男女矿工的双手。越南人说锦普矿像只柚子，意思是只要剥开最外层的皮就行。但是，丰饶的矿藏也只有在摆脱法国殖民者的剥夺、回到自己的主人手里以后，才会露出笑容，才能那么高兴地迎接自己所哺育的儿女们的铁镐。到海防港，你能看到码头工人的双手，他们日日夜夜，辛勤而又愉快地在这祖国的第一大港的码头上来往奔波，把成千吨，成万吨的货物装上大轮船，远涉重洋，到外国去；或者把那些从远方来的货物卸下。到宜安，你的面前展现出一幅令人振奋的工地的场景，在建筑工人的双手里，一座崭新的发电厂就要诞生。许多工厂、抽水站和人家都在等待，等待着建筑工人、发电工人的双手，给他们带来光和热！
    到山区和平原的广大农村，你可以看到农民的长了茧子的双手。他们的手是强健有力的。在干旱的日子里，他们提出了响亮的口号：“从土地里绞出水来！”他们的双手，战胜了天灾；在晴和的日子里，你还会看到清化小伙子攀缘百尺枝头去砍椰子的矫捷的手，看到北江姑娘们采蜜柑的轻盈的手，看见富义乡男女老幼们编造精细的藤器的名闻远近的手。他们世世代代，在这土地上生活，可是那是多么漫长的搅和着血和泪的岁月啊！什么时候，他们的双手曾像今天这样为自己劳动？他们的歌声曾像今天这样为自己的生活欢唱？
    到河内，你不能不倾倒于姑娘们灵巧的手。她们把如此鲜艳的花朵，如此秀丽的山川，如此栩栩如生的人物，用彩色的丝线都绣在画幅上。如果你要说，她们把整个美好的生活都绣上了，也是并不夸张的。同样，你又怎能不赞赏和感谢玉河村人们的种花的手，在那个鲜花的村庄里，万紫千红，四季花开，那么多的芍药、牡丹、万岁菊和剑兰，把生活点缀得多么迷人！
    越南人的双手，能劳动，也能学文化。你看那几位老大爷和老大娘，细眯着眼睛，缓慢地移动着手，在做什么呀？他们在学写字。这里每一只手，也许一辈子只是扛锄头和纺线，只是在解放以后，才有可能拿起十分陌生的笔。
    看完这组纪录片，你要说什么呢？你怎么会不跟我一样为越南人创造一切的勤劳的双手所感动、并且深深相信这千万双手一定能创造更加欢乐、更加富强的生活呢？
