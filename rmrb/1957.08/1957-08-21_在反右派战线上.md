On the Anti-Rightist Front

　　Outrageous "Main Points for Amending the Constitution"

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 18th: The bourgeois rightist Huang Zhenfan, an engineer from the Jiangxi Provincial Highway Transportation Department, has been exposed.

Huang Zhenfan took advantage of the Communist Party's rectification campaign to write a "Main Points for Amending the Constitution" aimed at abolishing the leadership of the Communist Party, the people's democratic dictatorship, and democratic centralism.

In the "Main Points for Amending the Constitution," this rightist proposed the establishment of "Advanced People's Congresses" at the national and local levels. After the establishment of the "National Advanced People's Congress," the current National People's Congress, the National People's Political Consultative Conference, the Chinese Communist Party, and other democratic parties would "automatically declare their dissolution," and "thereafter, no one in the country shall organize political parties separately."

　　Firing at the Party but Destroying Oneself: The Collapse of the Anti-Communist Clique at Northwest Normal College

This newspaper reports that Northwest Normal College recently uncovered an anti-communist clique named "Che Hong." The leading figure of this group was Ye Meng, a lecturer at the college, and the members included Zhu Jinqing, Wang Liejun, Li Yangxian, Shui Tianyang, and others. They launched a series of attacks against the Party under the guise of publishing the "Che Hong" wall newspaper.

When the People's Daily published the editorial "What Is the Reason?", they wrote an article entitled "Insults and Intimidation Are Not Struggle" to continue their counterattack against the Party. But they miscalculated. Their cannon fire did not destroy the Party; instead, their own anti-communist clique was destroyed by the masses.

　　Tearing Off the Engineer's Mask: Merely an Experienced Anti-Communist

Special dispatch from this newspaper and Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, 19th: Li Jiabin, a mechanical and electrical engineer at the Fushun Mining Bureau and a member of the preparatory committee of the China Democratic League, has been exposed by the workers as a consistent anti-communist rightist.

Li Jiabin maliciously slandered, saying, "The Communist Party makes intellectuals work with repentance every day, kneeling before God to pray every day," and falsely accused the Party's unity with intellectuals as a "mere formality," claiming that the Party only used the knowledge of intellectuals and did not allow them to "speak or move recklessly."

Li Jiabin came from a family of large landlords and headmen. He began engaging in espionage activities in 1946 and was appointed as a major liaison staff officer in the Fushun Command Post of the 2nd Pacification Brigade by a secret agent leader. After liberation, Li Jiabin never thoroughly confessed his criminal activities and even hid a pistol used during his time as a secret agent until the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement.

　　在反右派战线上
　  岂有此理的“修改宪法要点”
    据新华社南昌18日电　江西省公路运输厅的资产阶级右派分子、工程师黄振藩已经被揭露出来。
    黄振藩利用共产党整风的机会，写了一份目的在取消共产党的领导、取消人民民主专政、取消民主集中制的“修改宪法要点”。
    在“修改宪法要点”里，这个右派分子提出要在全国和地方都成立“先进人民代表大会”。在“全国先进人民代表大会”成立以后，现在的全国人民代表大会、全国政协、中国共产党及其他民主党派“均自动宣布解散”，“此后全国任何人不得另组织政治党派”。
  　向党开炮却轰毁了自己西北师范学院反共小集团垮台
    本报讯　西北师范学院最近揭发出一个以“车轰”为名的反共小集团。这个集团的首要分子是该院讲师叶萌，成员有朱金庆、王烈骏、李仰先、水天阳等。他们以出刊“车轰”墙报为名，向党发动了一系列进攻。
    当人民日报发表“这是为什么”的社论以后，他们就写了一篇“辱骂和恐吓不是战斗”的文章，继续向党反扑。但是他们失算了，他们开的炮没有把党轰毁，倒是他们自己的反共小集团被群众轰毁了。
    撕破了工程师的外衣只不过是一贯反共的里手
    本报特约新华社抚顺19日电　抚顺矿务局机电工程师、市民盟筹委委员李家宾，经过职工们的揭发证实是一个一贯反共的右派分子。
    李家宾恶毒地污蔑说“共产党让知识分子每天要忏悔地工作，每天跪在天主面前祈祷”，并诬蔑党对知识分子的团结是“表面形式”，党只是利用知识分子的知识，不许知识分子“乱说乱动”。
    李家宾出身于大地主兼大把头的家庭，1946年就开始进行特务活动，并被特务头子任命为绥靖二大队抚顺指挥室的少校联络参谋。解放后，李家宾一直没有彻底交代他的罪恶活动，直到肃反时还埋藏着一枝当特务时用的手枪。
