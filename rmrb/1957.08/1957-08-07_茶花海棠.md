    Camellia Begonia
    July in Kunming is the season when camellia begonias are in full bloom. People are drawn to a corner of the southwestern island of Cuihu Park to view the Camellia Begonia Exhibition.
    The camellia begonia is a type of begonia flower. Because some of its flower shapes resemble camellias, people call it the camellia begonia. In fact, its flower shape is not limited to resembling camellias! It could also be called peony begonia, peony begonia…
    This flower was introduced from abroad twelve years ago by Mr. Qin Renchang, a professor at Yunnan University. After careful cultivation in Yunnan, it has grown from more than two hundred pots to more than a thousand pots, with nearly a hundred varieties. According to their flower shape, they are divided into single petals and double petals. According to their color, red includes: dark red, bright red, light red, pink, and pale red; yellow includes: dark yellow, bright yellow, light yellow, brownish yellow, and apricot yellow; there are also pure white ones; and there are some colors that cannot be named.
    The flowering period of the camellia begonia starts from the beginning of June and continues until October. This flower has strict requirements for sunlight, soil, and moisture, and is prone to death if there is any negligence.
    Currently, the Datangzi Horticultural Farm in Kunming is using artificial pollination to collect seeds and cultivate a large number of seedlings. In addition to continuing to maintain the original varieties, it will also cultivate more new varieties in order to promote them on a large scale.

    茶花海棠
    7月的昆明，正是茶花海棠盛开的季节。人们被吸引在翠湖公园西南岛的一角里，观赏茶花海棠展览会。
    茶花海棠是海棠花的一种，因为它的花型有的像茶花，人们就把它称为茶花海棠。其实，它的花型何只像茶花呢！也可以称它为牡丹海棠、芍药海棠……。
    这种花是在十二年前，由云南大学教授秦仁昌先生从国外移进来的。在云南经过精心培育，已从二百多盆发展到千多盆，近百个品种。按其花状来分，有单片、双片的。按其颜色来分，红色有：深红、大红、浅红、粉红、淡红；黄色有：深黄、大黄、浅黄、棕黄、杏黄；也有纯白色的；还有一些叫不出名字的颜色。
    茶花海棠的花期，从6月初开始，一直开到10月。这种花对于阳光、土质、水分要求比较严格，稍有疏忽容易死亡。
    目前，昆明大塘子园艺场正在采用人工授粉的办法采摘籽种，大量培育花苗，除继续保持原有品种外，还要培植更多的新品种，以便大量推广。
