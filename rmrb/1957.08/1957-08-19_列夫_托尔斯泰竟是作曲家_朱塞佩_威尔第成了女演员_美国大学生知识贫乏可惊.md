　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 18th (TASS dispatch): According to an article in "The New Republic" magazine, this spring, Dr. Norman of the University of Chicago and Professor Sowen of Colorado State University compiled a list of historical figures and asked 359 first- and second-year undergraduates at a famous university in a southern state of the United States to answer who these people were. The list included world-renowned figures such as Karl Marx, Leo Tolstoy, Oliver Cromwell, Giuseppe Verdi, and Pablo Ruiz y Picasso.

    However, the results of the test greatly disappointed the professors, because only 22% of the test takers could name the nationality and some activities of half of the famous people. In fact, only half of the students knew four out of twenty world-renowned figures.

    The two professors said that the answers given by these college students were "full of ridiculous mistakes." To the answer for the great Italian composer Giuseppe Verdi, some said he was a humorist, and some said he was a political activist. Some students even said he was a French actress.

    The answers to the great Russian writer Tolstoy were similar, for example, saying that Tolstoy was a "composer," "orchestra conductor," "physicist," and so on.

    Most students could not even correctly spell the name of the current American President Eisenhower.

    列夫·托尔斯泰竟是作曲家  朱塞佩·威尔第成了女演员
    美国大学生知识贫乏可惊
    新华社18日讯　据塔斯社纽约15日讯：据“新共和杂志”的一篇文章说，今年春天，芝加哥大学的诺曼博士和科罗拉多州大学的索温教授编了一份历史人物名单，请美国南部一个州的著名大学的三百五十九名一、二年级大学生回答这是些什么人。列入名单的有：卡尔·马克思、列夫·托尔斯泰、奥利佛·克伦威尔、朱塞佩·威尔第、帕勃洛·路易斯·伊·毕卡索等世界名人。
    但是，测验的结果使教授们大失所望。因为只有22％的应试者能够答出半数名人的国籍和一些活动。而且实际上只有一半学生在二十位世界名人中知道四个人。
    这两位教授说，这些大学生的答案是“笑话百出”的。对意大利的伟大作曲家朱塞佩·威尔第的答案有的说他是幽默家，有的说是政治活动家。有些学生竟然说他是法国的女演员。
    对俄国大文豪托尔斯泰的答案也是如此，例如说托尔斯泰是“作曲家”，“乐队指挥”，“物理学家”等等。
    大多数学生还不能正确地写出美国现任总统艾森豪威尔的名字。
