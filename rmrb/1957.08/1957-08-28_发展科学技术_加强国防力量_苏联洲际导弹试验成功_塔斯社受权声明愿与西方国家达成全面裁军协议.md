Xinhua News Agency, August 27th: TASS, Moscow, August 26th: TASS announces:

In accordance with the plan for scientific research work, the testing of an intercontinental ballistic rocket, as well as the explosion of nuclear and thermonuclear weapons, were successfully conducted in the Soviet Union.

(I)

Recently, a super-long-range, multi-stage, intercontinental ballistic rocket was launched.

The rocket test was very successful, fully confirming the correctness of the calculations and the chosen design. The rocket flew at an unprecedented altitude. After flying an extremely long distance in a short time, it landed in the western region.

The test results show that it is possible to launch rockets to any region on Earth. The solution to the problem of manufacturing intercontinental ballistic rockets makes it possible for rockets to reach remote areas without relying on strategic air forces (which are currently easily subdued by modern air defense tools).

Considering the enormous contribution of this scientific and technological achievement to the development of science and its great significance for strengthening the national defense of the Soviet state, the Soviet government expresses its gratitude to the vast number of personnel who participated in the design and manufacture of intercontinental ballistic rockets and the design and manufacture of the entire set of equipment ensuring the rocket launch.

(II)

Recently, the Soviet Union conducted a series of nuclear and thermonuclear (hydrogen) weapon explosions. To ensure the safety of residents, the explosions were carried out at high altitudes. The tests were very successful.

As a result of the above tests, TASS is authorized to declare as follows:

For many years, the United Nations has not achieved any results in discussing disarmament issues, including the prohibition and cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapon tests.

The Soviet government has consistently pursued a policy of peace and has repeatedly put forward concrete proposals on achieving reductions in the armed forces and armaments of all countries, prohibiting atomic and hydrogen weapons and ceasing the testing of such weapons, and other measures related to disarmament issues. However, Western countries have not taken any practical steps in disarmament to this day. On the contrary, they are creating various obstacles on the road to reaching an agreement on this most important issue of our time.

It is well known that the United States and its accomplices not only refuse to prohibit atomic and hydrogen weapons, but also are actually unwilling to reach an agreement on the unconditional and immediate cessation of nuclear weapon tests, and are simultaneously testing such weapons on a large scale.

Due to the clearly negative attitude taken by Western countries, primarily the United States, towards a satisfactory resolution of the disarmament issue, the Soviet government has had to take all necessary measures to ensure the security of the Soviet state.

At the same time, the Soviet government will continue to unremittingly strive for an agreement on the cessation of testing and prohibition of atomic weapons, and on the entire disarmament issue, which the people of all countries hope will be properly resolved.

　　发展科学技术　加强国防力量
　　苏联洲际导弹试验成功
　　塔斯社受权声明愿与西方国家达成全面裁军协议
    新华社27日讯　塔斯社莫斯科26日讯：塔斯社宣布：
    按照科学研究工作的计划，在苏联顺利地进行了洲际弹道火箭的试验，以及核武器和热核武器的爆炸。
    （一）
    最近，发射了一枚超远程的、多级的、洲际弹道火箭。
    火箭的试验进行得很顺利，完全证实了计算的正确性和所选择的设计的正确性。火箭在前所未有的高度飞行。它在短时间内飞行了极远的路程以后，在西部地区着地。
    试验结果表明，有可能向地球上的任何地区发射火箭。制造洲际弹道火箭问题的解决使得火箭有可能不依靠战略空军（战略空军目前是现代防空工具所容易制服的）而达到遥远的地区。
    考虑到这一科学技术成就对发展科学的巨大贡献，以及对加强苏维埃国家的国防力量的重大意义，苏联政府向参加设计和制造洲际弹道火箭、设计和制造保证火箭发射的整套设备的广大全体工作人员表示感谢。
    （二）
    最近苏联进行了一系列核武器和热核（氢）武器的爆炸。为了保证居民的安全，爆炸是在高空进行的。试验进行得很顺利。
    由于上述试验，塔斯社受权声明如下：
    许多年来，在讨论包括禁止和停止试验原子武器和氢武器问题在内的裁军问题方面，联合国没有得到任何结果。
    苏联政府一贯奉行和平政策，曾经不止一次地就实现裁减各国武装力量和军备、禁止原子武器和氢武器及停止试验这一类武器、以及其他有关裁军问题的措施提出具体建议。但是，西方国家至今没有在裁军方面采取任何实际步骤。和这相反，它们却在当代这个最重要问题达成协议的道路上制造种种障碍。
    大家知道，美国和它的同伙们不仅拒绝禁止原子武器和氢武器，而且实际上也不愿意就无条件地立刻停止试验核武器达成协议，并且同时在大量地试验这种武器。
    由于西方国家，首先是美国对圆满解决裁军问题采取如此明显的否定态度，苏联政府不得不采取各种必要措施以保证苏维埃国家的安全。
    同时，苏联政府将继续坚持不懈地争取在停止试验和禁止原子武器方面，在整个裁军问题方面达成协议，这是世界各国人民都希望妥善加以解决的。
