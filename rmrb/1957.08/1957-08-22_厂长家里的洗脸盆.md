　　The Washbasin in the Factory Director's Home
　　In the home of Wang Bomin, the director of the Shanghai Shipyard, there is a broken washbasin. Now, his family no longer uses this washbasin for washing their faces. Old Wang uses it as a "mirror" in his home.
　　The washbasin can be used as a "mirror" not because it is particularly shiny, but because it has a special origin.
　　In the summer of 1947, Old Wang followed the army south from Hebei Province and participated in the Suiqi Campaign, capturing Kaifeng and going straight into the Dabie Mountains. In the Dabie Mountains, there were battles and marches every day. Once, during a battle, he crossed the flooded river, and the washbasin of the regimental chief of staff fell from his horse. Old Wang asked the communications soldier to pick it up and carry it with him. After the campaign, he returned it to the chief of staff, but the chief of staff resolutely refused to accept it. Since then, this washbasin became Old Wang and the communications soldier's versatile treasure for washing faces, washing feet, washing clothes, and holding food. After the victory of the Liberation War, Old Wang entered Shanghai. This washbasin has been kept by his side. When it was broken, he repaired it. When it could no longer be used, Old Wang displayed it in his room.
　　Every day after work, Old Wang walks around in the room and can see this washbasin. Seeing it, he cannot forget the not-so-distant past. In the difficult war years, he often carried only twelve jin of belongings with him - two pairs of shoes, a set of unlined clothing... Once, the belongings of him and his wife were completely lost, and they relied on others to give them unlined clothes to change. Comparing today's life with the past, it has greatly exceeded "twelve jin." Since April of this year, he has spent half a day every Sunday visiting workers' families. Seeing the difficulties of the workers' families in housing, he decided to give up half of his house to a single comrade in the factory. Although some people think that it is not too much for his family of nine to live in three rooms, and that giving up half would be very inconvenient, he said: "In the past, when marching to a place, we sometimes lived in farmers' cowsheds, sometimes we laid some grass on the ground in front of people's beds and slept, and the chickens were still jumping around on our heads. Although today's conditions are different from the past, as a Communist Party member, I can't go too far!"

### 厂长家里的洗脸盆

　　厂长家里的洗脸盆
    在上海船厂厂长汪伯民家里，有一只破脸盆。现在，他们家已不用这只脸盆洗脸了。老汪是把它当作一面“镜子”放在家里的。
    脸盆能够当作“镜子”用，并不是因为它特别光亮；而是因为它有特殊的来历。
    1947年夏天，老汪从河北省随军南下，参加了睢杞战役，打下了开封，直下大别山区。在大别山时，天天打仗，天天行军，有次在战斗中冲过漫水河，团参谋长的一只脸盆从马上落下来，老汪就叫通讯员拾起来带着，战役结束后，仍送还给参谋长，但参谋长坚决不收。从此，这只脸盆就成为老汪和通讯员经常洗脸、洗脚、洗衣、盛菜的万能宝贝。解放战争胜利了，老汪进了上海，这只脸盆一直放在身边，用坏了，补了又补，不能用了，老汪就把它陈列在房间里。
    每天下班回来，老汪在房间里走来走去，都可看见这只脸盆。看到它，就使他不能忘怀那并不太久远的过去。在艰苦的战争的岁月里，他身旁经常只带十二斤东西——两双鞋子、一套单衣……有一次他和爱人两个人的东西，丢得精光，靠别人送的单衣换洗。他把今天的生活和过去一比，已经大大超过“十二斤”了。今年4月以来，他每个星期天用半天时间访问工人家庭，看到工人家庭居住的困难，就决定把自己住的房子让出半间，给厂里一个单身同志住。虽然有人认为他家九口人住三间房子不算多，让出后会感到很多不方便，但是他却说：“过去行军到一个地方，有时住在农民的牛棚里，有时在人家的床前地上铺点草，就睡下来，小鸡还在头上跳来跳去哩。虽然今天的条件和过去不同了，可是作为一个共产党员，总不能出格啊！”　（原载解放日报）
