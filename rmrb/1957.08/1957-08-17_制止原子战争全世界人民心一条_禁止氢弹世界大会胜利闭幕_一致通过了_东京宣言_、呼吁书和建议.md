Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 16th: The Third World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament held its final plenary session today at the Tokyo Gymnasium.

The conference chairman announced the arrival of the Mongolian delegation, which had been delayed by the Japanese government's slow issuance of entry visas and only arrived in Tokyo last night. He introduced the delegation members to the conference, and the entire hall welcomed them with prolonged and enthusiastic applause.

The head of the Mongolian delegation, Damdinsuren, also a member of the World Peace Council, addressed the conference, stating that the Mongolian delegation fully agreed with the opinions and conclusions reached through discussions at the conference thus far. The forces of peace and friendship can transform harmful atomic bombs into atomic energy that serves humanity.

Subsequently, Japanese representatives Masahiko Sekiya, Yoshitaro Hirano, and Mikae Fujima reported to the conference on the results of the meetings of various sectors in Japan, the conference's group discussions, and the plenary session of representatives from various countries held yesterday.

Sekiya Masahiko said that the Japanese sector meetings unanimously demanded: the immediate and unconditional prohibition of the testing, production, stockpiling, and use of nuclear weapons; the removal of foreign military bases, especially the prohibition of establishing atomic bases; and the realization of complete disarmament. The report pointed out that representatives from all sectors of Japanese workers, students, youth, women, and religious circles are determined to stand at the forefront of the opposition to nuclear weapons and take unified action with people from all sectors across the country.

Hirano Yoshitaro reported that the group discussions focused on the increasingly serious dangers of atomic war. The group discussions unanimously confirmed that the most important task of the peace movement centered on opposing nuclear weapons is to destroy the atomic war system.

Ma Chun-ku, the representative of the World Federation of Trade Unions, pointed out in his speech that the representatives participating in this conference were more extensive than in the past two conferences, and the discussions at the conference were also clearer and more profound, which shows that the movement against nuclear weapons and for disarmament is developing. He said that the World Federation of Trade Unions will make every effort to promote and implement the resolutions of this conference in the international workers' movement.

Indian representatives Kalelkar and Chandra spoke at the meeting successively. Kalelkar said that the demands of the Japanese people for the removal of American military bases in Okinawa and other parts of the country should be clearly included in the conference resolution.

Chandra said in his speech that we believe the brave Japanese people and Japanese youth will definitely be able to achieve the goal of removing foreign military bases and striving for peace. I fully support your movement.

At the meeting held this afternoon, the conference unanimously adopted the "Tokyo Declaration," the "Appeal to the United Nations and Governments of All Countries of the World," and "Suggestions for Taking Joint Action to Prohibit Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and Strive for Disarmament."

Representatives from Okinawa Island and various parts of Japan presented gifts to foreign representatives at the meeting.

Australian representative William Morrow spoke on behalf of the representatives from various countries. He said that if everyone in the world unites, it will constitute a huge force to stop nuclear weapons and war. He pointed out that the struggle of peace-loving people is not over, but they are on the road to victory.

Yasui Kaoru spoke on behalf of the Japanese organizers of the conference. He said, "We cannot be satisfied with just holding meetings and passing resolutions. We must express our will through action." He hoped that representatives from various countries and representatives from various parts of Japan would return to their respective countries and hometowns to concretely implement the conference's declaration and resolutions.

Kazuo Fukumoto, chairman of the Japan Youth League Council, delivered the closing remarks at the end. He said, "We believe that workers, women, students, and people from all other sectors in countries around the world will, from today onwards, conduct activities in accordance with the 'Tokyo Declaration.'"

At 4:10 p.m., the conference successfully concluded with the singing of "Don't Allow the Use of Atomic Bombs" by all representatives and prolonged applause and cheers.
