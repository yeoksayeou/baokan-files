A legendary general existed in the guerrilla forces of Changbai Mountain. He could swim in the sea and fly in the sky. He gathered heroes from all over the world in a tent where the sun and moon never set. He dipped his sword in the sacred water of Tianchi Lake, forging it into a gleaming silver blade. When he came to the forest, he climbed the green cypresses and pines, like a steed riding the wind, crossing the great rivers and flying over the peaks. The general summoned wind and rain on the mountain, and the brave warriors were unimpeded by knives or spears below. The Tumen and Yalu Rivers sang for them, and rainbows and brilliant clouds danced with them.

However, even a steed can stumble, and even the bravest warrior can make mistakes. One day, a large group of Japanese devils suddenly captured a guerrilla fighter. That night, dark clouds loomed, and the wind and rain were bitter. The devils patrolled the ten miles of peaks and ridges, and finally strangled the guerrilla fighter to death.

The next day, the morning light filtered through the forest. A large grave appeared in the forest. The grave was covered with green thatch, and a wooden sign was erected in front of it. The sign read "Tomb of a Korean Hero," and at the side was the inscription "Respectfully erected by the Chinese." Ah! The priceless incense wafted in the wind, fragrant and refreshing.

From then on, the devils were even more terrified. One night, the puppet soldiers and police searched every household within thirty miles, but they could not find the person who put up the wooden sign. The Koreans said "Don't know," and the Chinese said "Bu xiao de." Different languages expressed the same determination. Until the east showed the dawn, people still silently went to the fields to cultivate.

Those robbers who gained nothing had to return empty-handed to the barracks. The dispirited Japanese captain listlessly lay down on the bed, and a red and dazzling banner appeared on the wall opposite him. The words on the banner were strange: "I, who was strangled by you, am standing here today to take back your head." The Japanese devil, superstitious in "Amaterasu," cried "Ah!" His face turned white and his heart panicked. He wanted to jump up and tear off the banner, but his legs were weak and he fell to the ground.

At this moment, leaflets were posted everywhere in the village: "Unite the Chinese and Korean people, overthrow Japanese imperialism!"

    长白山的一个传说
    李旭长白山的游击队里有位惊天动地的名将。既能在大海遨游，又能在高空飞翔。他在日月永不沉落的帐篷，召集天下的英雄好汉。蘸着天池的灵水，磨成银光闪烁的宝剑。当他来到森林里，就攀着翠柏苍松，如同骏马驾起长风，越过大江，飞过高峰。名将在山上呼风唤雨，勇士们在山下刀枪无阻。豆满江和鸭绿江为他们歌唱，彩虹和艳霞伴他们起舞。然而，骏马也会失蹄，勇士也会失手，一天，一大队鬼子，突然把一个游击队员抓走。那一天夜里，乌云笼罩，风雨凄凄；鬼子围着十里峰峦巡哨，终于把游击队员绞死。第二天，晨光透过森林。森林里出现一座大坟。坟上铺满了绿色的茅草，坟前竖起一块木牌。牌上写着“朝鲜英雄之墓”，边上落款“中国人敬立”。呵！那金不换的香啊！迎风飘散，芬芳沁鼻。从此，鬼子更加胆战心惊，一个晚上，伪军和警察，清查了三十里家家户户，查不到立木牌的人。朝鲜人说“不知道”，中国人说“不晓得”。不同的语言表达同样的决心。直到东方显出曙光，人们依旧默默地下地耕耘。那些一无所获的强盗，只得空手转回兵营。垂头丧气的鬼子队长没精打采刚往床上一躺，一条红色耀眼的标语，出现在他对面的墙上。标语上的字句真是奇怪：“被你绞死的我，就站在这里今天，要取还你的脑袋”。迷信“天昭天神”的鬼子“呵呀”一声，脸白心慌。正想跳起身来撕去标语，谁知两腿酸软倒在地上。正在这个时候传单在村子里到处贴起：“中朝人民团结起来，打倒日本帝国主义！”（附图片）
