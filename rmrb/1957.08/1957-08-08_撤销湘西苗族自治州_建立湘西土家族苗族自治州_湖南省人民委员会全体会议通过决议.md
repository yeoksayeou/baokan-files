Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 7th - The Hunan Provincial People's Committee held its 21st plenary meeting (enlarged meeting) yesterday, approving the work summary report of the Xiangxi Tujia Visiting Group; and passed the resolution on "Abolishing the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture and Establishing the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture," which will be submitted to the State Council for approval. The meeting also approved the list of the new autonomous prefecture preparatory committee and the preparatory work plan.

Zhang Mengxu (Han), the head of the Xiangxi Tujia Visiting Group and Deputy Governor of Hunan Province, made a work summary report of the visiting group at the meeting. The report said that as a result of the assimilation policy of the reactionary rule, the Tujia people were erased from the history of the motherland. After liberation, with the care and support of party and government at all levels, and after many investigations and studies, the Tujia people were finally officially identified as a single ethnic group in October 1956. The main task of the visiting group's visit to the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture this time was to publicize the ethnic policy and fully consult on the form of ethnic regional autonomy. The visiting group, composed of more than 600 representatives of Miao, Tujia, Han, Hui, Dong, and Man ethnic groups, visited the ten counties of the autonomous prefecture for a total of 50 days. Through symposiums, mass meetings, and individual visits, they visited 80% of the Tujia people in these ten counties. According to the more than 300,000 people visited by the visiting group and the more than 20,000 letters received by the visiting group, at the end of the visit, only dozens of Tujia people advocated separate autonomy, and the vast majority of the Tujia people unanimously advocated joint autonomy with the Miao people. The Miao people also generally welcomed joint autonomy with the Tujia people.

The report said that the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture has a population of more than 1.7 million, of which the Tujia people account for more than 22%, the Miao people account for more than 19%, and the rest are Han, Hui, and other ethnic groups. The Tujia people and the Miao people are present in all ten counties of the autonomous prefecture. Among the 293 townships in the prefecture, 184 townships have Tujia people, and 157 townships have mixed residence of Miao, Tujia, and Han people. The laboring people of the Tujia and Miao ethnic groups have always maintained a close relationship like flesh and blood. They not only intermarry, but also jointly resisted the rule of the Qing Dynasty and the Kuomintang. After liberation, the unity between the two ethnic groups became even closer, and they jointly participated in production and social reform. Now, more than 98% of the farmers in the prefecture have joined agricultural cooperatives, and there are more than 800 joint cooperatives of Tujia, Miao, and Han ethnic groups in the more than 3,000 cooperatives. Since liberation, various construction undertakings in the prefecture have made great progress. In 1956, the total grain output of the prefecture increased by 18.7% compared with 1952; before liberation, there was not a single factory in the prefecture, and now there are 47 local factories and mines in the prefecture, with an annual total output value of more than 6 million yuan. Since liberation, more than 260 kilometers of highways have been built in the prefecture, and every county and township can be connected by telephone. In 1957, the number of middle school students in the prefecture increased by 81.5% compared with 1952. According to statistics in February this year, among the cadres in the prefecture's organs above the township level, there are more than 2,300 Miao people and more than 1,500 Tujia people, and many of them have taken up leadership positions at all levels. The above-mentioned ethnic distribution and the development of political, economic, and cultural construction have made the ten counties of the prefecture form an indivisible whole. Therefore, the Tujia and Miao people demand to further strengthen ethnic unity and implement joint autonomy on the existing work basis.

The report said that under our country's state system and ethnic policies, joint autonomy will fully guarantee the rights of the two ethnic groups to be masters of their own affairs and various autonomous rights, and promote the common development of all ethnic groups.

The report said that if the Tujia and Miao ethnic groups each have separate autonomy, it would mean dividing the four counties including Longshan in northwestern Hunan into a Tujia Autonomous Prefecture, and the six counties including Jishou in the south into a Miao Autonomous Prefecture. This would inevitably violate the common will of the people of all ethnic groups and divide "one stove fire into two stoves," and at the same time, it would cause the dispersion of financial, material, and human resources, which would obviously be unfavorable to the development of socialist construction in the entire Xiangxi region. In addition, due to the actual situation of the intertwined residence of the Tujia and Miao ethnic groups, it would be difficult to divide the administrative regions when implementing separate autonomy. If they are forcibly divided according to the northern and southern counties, a considerable part of the people will be left outside their own ethnic autonomous prefecture. This will have an impact on taking care of the internal feelings of all ethnic groups, and when formulating policies and measures related to ethnic minorities in each autonomous region, both parties must simultaneously consider the interests of other ethnic minorities within the territory, which will increase the difficulty in work. The report said that these shortcomings can be avoided by implementing joint autonomy.

### 撤销湘西苗族自治州  建立湘西土家族苗族自治州  湖南省人民委员会全体会议通过决议

    撤销湘西苗族自治州
    建立湘西土家族苗族自治州
    湖南省人民委员会全体会议通过决议
    新华社长沙7日电　湖南省人民委员会昨天举行第二十一次全体会议（扩大会议），批准了湘西土家族访问团工作总结报告；通过了“撤销湘西苗族自治州建立湘西土家族苗族自治州”的决议，报请国务院批准。会议还通过了新的自治州筹备委员会名单和筹备工作方案。
    湘西土家族访问团团长、湖南省副省长张孟旭（汉），在会上作了访问团工作总结报告。报告说，由于反动统治的同化政策的结果，把土家族从祖国的历史上抹煞掉了。解放后在各级党、政的关怀和支持下，经过多次调查研究，终于在1956年10月正式确定土家族为一个单一民族。访问团这次访问湘西苗族自治州，主要任务是宣传民族政策，充分协商民族区域自治形式。由苗、土家、汉、回、侗、满等各民族代表六百多人组成的访问团，在自治州十个县共访问了五十天，通过座谈会、群众大会和个别访问等形式，访问了这十个县80％的土家族人民。根据访问团访问的三十多万人和访问团收到的二万多人的来信看，在访问工作结束时，只有几十个土家族人民主张单独自治，其余绝大多数土家族人民都一致主张同苗族人民联合自治。苗族人民也普遍欢迎同土家族人民联合自治。
    报告说，湘西苗族自治州共有人口一百七十多万人，其中土家族占22％以上，苗族占19％以上，其余为汉、回等民族。土家族同苗族在自治州十个县都有，全州二百九十三个乡镇中，一百八十四个乡镇有土家族，一百五十七个乡镇有苗族、土家、汉族杂居。土家、苗族两族劳动人民历来就保持了血肉般亲密关系，不但共同通婚，而且还共同反抗过清朝和国民党的统治。解放后，两族人民团结更加亲密，并且共同参加生产和社会改革。现在全州98％以上的农户加入了农业社，在三千多个社中有八百多个土家、苗、汉族联合社。在解放以后，全州的各项建设事业都有很大发展。1956年全州粮食总产量比1952年增加了18.7％；解放前全州没有一个工厂，现在全州已有地方厂矿四十七个，每年总产值达六百多万元。解放后，全州共修了二百六十多公里公路，每县每乡都可通电话。1957年全州中学生人数比1952年增加了81.5％。据今年2月统计，全州乡以上机关干部中苗族有二千三百多人，土家族有一千五百多人，不少人担任了各级领导工作。上述的民族分布情况和政治、经济、文化建设的发展，已使全州十个县形成为一个不可分割的整体，因此土家族和苗族人民要求在现有的工作基础上进一步加强民族团结，实行联合自治。
    报告说，在我国国家制度和民族政策下，联合自治将充分保证两族人民实现当家作主和各项自治的权利，促进各族人民的共同发展。
    报告说，如果土家族同苗族各自单独自治，就是要把湘西北部龙山等四县划为土家族自治州，南部吉首等六县划为苗族自治州，这样势必违反各族人民的共同意愿，把“一炉火分为两炉烧”，同时也将造成财力、物力、人力的分散，显然不利于整个湘西地区的社会主义建设的发展。此外，由于土家、苗族交错杂居的实际情况，实行单独自治时行政区划也难于划分。如果勉强按南北各县划分，彼此都将有相当一部分人留在本民族自治州以外。这对照顾各民族的内部感情有影响，而且在各个自治区域内制定有关少数民族的政策措施时，两方都必须同时考虑到境内其他少数民族利益，这就增加了工作中的困难。报告说，这些缺点，实行联合自治都可以避免。
