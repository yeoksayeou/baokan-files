Yang Ziheng, Chairman of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League and Director of the Gansu Provincial Department of Transportation, tried his best to portray himself as "insignificant" when confessing his reactionary crimes at the National People's Congress, saying that he had not received instructions from Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji, but was merely ideologically aligned with them. However, people only need to look at Yang Ziheng's history to know that his anti-Communist and anti-people face cannot be concealed.

From 1931 to 1935, Yang Ziheng led counter-revolutionary troops in actively suppressing revolutionary forces. To this day, people cannot forget the gunshots of the Red Army and revolutionary masses being shot all night at the Pingliang Small Drill Ground, cannot forget the tragic scene of burying seventy or eighty Red Army soldiers in one pit in Zhangjiabian, cannot forget the more than five hundred Red Army commanders and fighters who sacrificed in Ziwu Valley, cannot forget the thousands upon thousands of revolutionary soldiers who died after being blocked by Yang and forced to enter the Hexi Corridor from the Sichuan border... But in his autobiography, he shamelessly wrote: "During the Great Revolution of 1927, I went to Hankou on official business and saw the Chinese Communist Party's brave progress, and only then did I have some initial understanding of the revolutionary path."

As early as 1940, Yang Ziheng was already in cahoots with Zhang Bojun. In 1947, under Zhang Bojun's instructions, Yang Ziheng secretly engaged in military activities, attempting to realize Zhang Bojun's conspiracy to divide the country into three parts with the Communist Party. After the national liberation, Zhang Bojun sent Yang Ziheng back to Gansu from Beijing, saying: "You are a local, familiar with the personnel, and it will be useful for you to go back to work." After he arrived in Gansu, he sent three people to the Tianshui area to recruit troops, but this was stopped by the government. However, Yang Ziheng was not reconciled and still actively tried to expand his own forces. He firmly opposed the organizational policy of the China Democratic League of "focusing on cultural and educational circles, focusing on the upper and middle classes, and focusing on large and medium-sized cities." His policy was "If we don't develop the backward people, who will we develop!"

Yang Ziheng also frequently spread Zhang Bojun's influence in Gansu. For example, he said that the conference of intellectuals convened by the Central Committee of the Communist Party was convened on the recommendation of Zhang Bojun after conducting in-depth investigations among intellectuals. He said that Luo Longji was a "think tank" whose "literary talent was much stronger than Hu Shi's." After Zhang Bojun published anti-Party remarks, Yang Ziheng was even more elated and said that he was "a capable politician."

Yang Ziheng held a hostile attitude towards the Communist Party everywhere and openly opposed the Party's leadership. Once, when the chairman of the provincial transportation trade union read out the evaluation criteria at a conference, he said "under the leadership of the Party." Yang Ziheng, as the director of the Department of Transportation, was angry and said: "If it's under the leadership of the Party, I won't take care of it." He often told others: "Don't emphasize the words 'Party leadership' anymore, the old ways are no longer applicable, you must broaden your horizons!" When he saw some members of the China Democratic League getting close to Party members, he also scolded them for "having no backbone, no stand, are you afraid of not having food to eat if you oppose Party members?!"

In order to undermine the Party's prestige, Yang Ziheng always denied the achievements of the Party's work. In Yang's eyes, the tax policy was "killing the chicken to get the egg." When the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain was implemented, he said: "Too much is unified, many people have nothing to eat!" During the socialist transformation of industry and commerce, he said: "The capitalists are too miserable, they can't afford to eat, the Communist Party's policy is not good, the restrictions are too strict!" His evaluation of agricultural cooperativization was: "It's terrible, only a few are doing well, the reason is that there are poor and idle people in the cooperatives!" In terms of cadre policy, the policy he put forward was "In the past, virtue was the main thing, now during the construction period, talent comes before virtue," and he also said, "County heads and county party secretaries are all young people, how can they do good things?" Yang Ziheng also always advocated "Gansu people governing Gansu." During the first session of the Gansu Provincial People's Congress, Yang Ziheng even tried to squeeze out Ma Hongbin (a Hui) from the position of vice chairman and seize his position. He instigated his cronies to write a note to Ma Hongbin: "Please step down, please let Yang Ziheng take the stage."

In order to expand his wings, Yang Ziheng used his position to turn the Department of Transportation and the China Democratic League into air-raid shelters for counter-revolutionary elements. Da Ergang, who had worked as a Japanese spy, was Yang's guest of honor and was placed in the Department of Transportation by Yang. The counter-revolutionary element Wang Guangbi had served as Yang's chief of the military law department, and continued to engage in counter-revolutionary activities after liberation. In 1951, Wang went to Hong Kong to accept a mission from Chiang Kai-shek's secret service, and returned to actively organize the "China People's Anti-Communist National Salvation Army Independent Thirty-eighth Column," attempting to carry out armed counter-revolutionary activities. At this time, Yang Ziheng actually brought Wang from Beijing to Lanzhou, renamed him "Wang Shenghui," and sent him to the Xinguang Qin Opera Troupe as a secretary. Later, Wang Guangbi was arrested, but Yang Ziheng did not explain this issue.

In mid-May of this year, the Guangming Daily sent reporters Ou Zhipei and Han Hongwen to Lanzhou to stir up trouble, and Yang Ziheng strongly supported them.

Now, Yang Ziheng still shows no remorse and still has a lingering attachment to the Zhang-Luo anti-Party alliance. But Yang Ziheng will not get away with it, because the people of Gansu will not allow it.

    杨子恒的葫芦里装些什么药？
    本报记者　顾雷
    民盟甘肃省主委、甘肃省交通厅长杨子恒在全国人民代表大会上交代他的反动罪行时，曾经极力把自己说得“微不足道”，说自己没有接受过章罗的指示，只是思想上的结合。但是，人们只要看看杨子恒的历史就知道他的反共反人民面目是掩饰不了的。
    从1931年到1935年，杨子恒率领反革命部队一直在积极扑杀革命力量。至今，人们不能忘记平凉小教场终夜枪杀红军和革命群众的枪声，不能忘记在张家砭一坑埋掉七八十个红军的惨景，不能忘记在子午谷牺牲的五百多名红军指战员，不能忘记被杨阻击后不得不由川边入河西走廊而死掉的成千上万个革命战士……。但是他在自传里竟然恬不知耻地写道：“1927年大革命时我因公到汉口，看到了中国共产党勇敢前进的做法，对于革命的道路才有了些初步认识”。
    远在1940年，杨子恒就和章伯钧拧在一起了。1947年，杨子恒在章伯钧的指使下，曾秘密进行军事活动，企图实现章伯钧同共产党三分天下的阴谋。全国解放后，章伯钧从北京把杨子恒派回甘肃，还说：“你是地方人，人事熟悉，回去工作有作用。”他到了甘肃以后，即派三个人到天水一带招兵买马，后被政府制止了。但是杨子恒并不甘心，仍积极设法扩大自己的势力。他坚决反对民盟“以文教界为主，以中上层为主，以大中城市为主”的组织方针。他的方针是“落后的人，盟不发展，叫谁去发展呢！”
    杨子恒在甘肃还经常散布章伯钧的影响。如说中共中央召开的知识分子会议，是章伯钧在知识分子中经过深入调查，才建议党中央召开的。说罗隆基是“智囊”“文章才华比胡适还强得多”。章伯钧发表反党言论以后，杨子恒更兴高彩烈地说他是“有一套的政治家”。
    杨子恒对共产党处处抱着敌对的态度，一直公开地反对党的领导。有一次，省运输工会主席在大会上念评比条件时，说了“在党领导下”的话。作为交通厅长的杨子恒却生气说：“在党的领导下，我就不管了。”他常告诉别人说：“党的领导这些话不要再强调了，老一套的办法不适用了，要把眼光放远一点！”当他看到有些盟员接近党员时，也骂他们“没有骨气，没有立场，你怕反对了党员没饭吃吗？！”
    为了破坏党的威信，杨子恒从来都是否定党的各项工作成绩的。税收政策在杨的眼里是“杀鸡取蛋”。实行粮食统购统销时，他说：“统得太多了，很多人没有饭吃！”工商业社会主义改造时，他说：“资本家太苦，吃不上饭，共产党政策不好，限制太严！”他对农业合作化的评价是：“糟得很，办得好的只是个别的，其原因是社内有贫农二流子！”在干部政策方面，他提出的方针是“过去是德为主，现在建设时期是先才后德”，又说“县长、县委书记都是尕娃，如何能办好事？”杨子恒还一味鼓吹“甘人治甘”。在甘肃省第一届各族各界人民代表大会期间，杨子恒竟妄想挤掉马鸿宾（回族）副主席，夺取他的职位。他唆使亲信给马鸿宾写条子：“请你下台，请杨子恒上台。”
    杨子恒为了扩大自己的羽翼，利用自己的职务，把交通厅、民盟变成反革命分子的防空洞。曾做过日本特务的达尔刚，是杨的座上客，被杨安插在交通厅。反革命分子王光壁曾任杨的军法处长，解放后继续进行反革命活动。1951年，王到香港接受了蒋匪特务的任务，回来积极组织“中华人民反共救国军独立第三十八纵队”，企图进行武装反革命活动。这时，杨子恒竟把王由北京接到兰州，为他改名“王生辉”，派到新光秦剧社当秘书。后来王光壁被捕了，杨子恒对此问题却没有交代。
    今年5月中旬，光明日报派记者欧至培、韩洪文到兰州点火，杨子恒大力支持。
    现在，杨子恒仍无悔罪表示，对于章、罗反党联盟仍有恋恋不舍之情。但杨子恒还是混不过关，因为甘肃省的人民是不答应的。
