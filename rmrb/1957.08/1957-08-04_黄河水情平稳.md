Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 2nd: The water levels at all stations along the Yellow River have receded below the warning level.

By 8 a.m. today, the water levels at all stations along the Yellow River, from Qinchang near the Zhengzhou Railway Bridge on the Beijing-Hankou Railway in the upper reaches, to Lijin at the estuary, had fallen below the warning level and were continuing to decrease. The tense Yellow River water situation, which had lasted for more than ten days in the second half of July, has eased.

In the past few days, only some areas in the Yellow River basin above Qinchang and in its tributaries have experienced light rain, and there have been no signs of major flooding in the main stream or tributaries of the Yellow River.

Currently, more than 150,000 flood control personnel who were guarding the embankments along the river have been withdrawn and returned home to resume production.

The Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters has instructed flood control agencies at all levels to further strengthen flood control work.

    黄河水情平稳
    新华社郑州2日电　黄河各站水位已回落到警戒水位以下。
    到今天8时，黄河上至京汉铁路郑州大铁桥附近的秦厂，下到入海的利津各站水位，都已经回落到警戒水位以下，而且在继续下降。7月下半月，紧张了十几天的黄河水情缓和下来了。
    这几天，黄河秦厂以上干、支流流域，只个别地区有小雨，黄河干、支流都没有出现大水的征候。
    目前，沿河上堤防守的十五万多名防汛队员，都已先后撤防回家生产。
    黄河防汛总指挥部指示各级防汛机构仍要进一步加强防汛工作。
