Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, August 18th. The Changchun Film Studio's anti-rightist struggle has entered a new stage after overcoming right-leaning thoughts within the Party. On the 17th, all the factory's staff held a mobilization meeting to deeply develop the anti-rightist struggle. Wang Lanshi, director of the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture, who came to Changchun from Beijing, spoke at the meeting. He encouraged all the staff of Changchun Film Studio to resolutely counter the activities of rightist elements inside and outside the Party who attempted to usurp the leadership of the film industry and defend the socialist film industry.

After the start of the rectification movement, some Party member art cadres with bourgeois artistic ideas and non-Party rightist elements at Changchun Film Studio cooperated with each other to launch a frantic attack on the Party's film industry. Some technical and artistic cadres who had transferred from the old society's film industry, during the blooming and contending movement, tried their best to deny the achievements of the socialist film industry and slandered the leadership of the Party committee and the Film Bureau as laymen. Some Party member art cadres also denied the Party's leading role in the film industry, openly promoted bourgeois artistic supremacy, and attacked the Party for not respecting "senior intellectuals" within the Party. They advocated that artists should manage the factory, believing that the achievements of the film industry were all due to the artists and directors. In order to attack the Party, they formed feudal guilds and anti-Party groups, and did not hesitate to take actions of setting up branch factories in opposition to the Party. Under the circumstances that these rightist elements inside and outside the Party cooperated with each other to launch a fierce attack on the Party, Zhong Dianfei, a rightist element of the Literary Gazette, sent his henchman Luo Dou from Beijing to Changchun to stir up trouble. They attempted to collude from within and without to shake Changchun Film Studio, this socialist artistic position. The rightist elements were also extremely arrogant in recommending to the higher-level Party committee those whom they considered "experts" to serve as factory director and Party committee secretary.

Due to the activities of these rightist elements, Changchun Film Studio had successively experienced several incidents of Party and League members causing trouble and engaging in anti-Party activities of appealing and petitioning. What was particularly rampant was that Liu Zhengtan, a rightist element of the Changchun Film Studio Orchestra, and Fang Zhenxiang, a rightist element within the Party, combined to exclude the Party members in the orchestra who were leading the rectification, and established an orchestra "presidium" under a false "name," viciously attacking the Party's leadership, openly refusing to accept work assignments, and undermining the orchestra's performance and the film production plan. After being "elected" to the "presidium," Liu Zhengtan tried his best to incite the masses to transform internal contradictions among the people into antagonistic contradictions, asking everyone to be determined to carry it through to the end. When this rightist backbone element petitioned in Beijing, he also planned to instigate the New Film Studio Orchestra to make trouble with them.

Since mid-June, the broad masses of Changchun Film Studio have launched a counterattack against the rightist elements on various fronts. Some of the masses who were deceived by the rightist elements have also begun to wake up. Now, there are seven battlefields, including the Changchun Film Studio Orchestra, the printing workshop, the recording workshop, the administrative department, the production management department, and the editing department, and more than ten rightist elements are engaged in face-to-face reasoning struggles. Some rightist elements, who had been promoted from members of the cultural troupe in the liberated areas to art cadres through the Party's long-term cultivation, and who had become arrogant, complacent and degenerated, have begun to lower their heads and admit their guilt, while others are still attempting to maintain their anti-Party stance together with other rightist elements. Under the direct guidance of the provincial and municipal Party committees, the CPC Changchun Film Studio Committee is further rectifying the ranks, examining right-leaning thoughts and lenient attitudes within the Party, and is determined to comprehensively and deeply carry out the anti-rightist struggle.

    人民影坛岂能让群魔乱舞
    长春制片厂党内外右派分子里应外合猖狂进攻
    全体人员分七个战场展开反击坚决粉碎右派集团
    新华社长春18日电　长春电影制片厂反右派斗争在克服党内右倾思想后，进入了新阶段。17日，全厂职工举行深入开展反右派斗争动员大会。由北京来长春的文化部电影事业管理局局长王阑西在会上发言，他鼓励长影全体人员坚决反击党内外右派分子企图篡夺电影事业领导权的活动，保卫社会主义电影事业。
    在整风运动开始后，长影一些具有资产阶级艺术思想的党员艺术干部和党外右派分子互相配合，向党的电影事业展开了猖狂进攻。一部分从旧社会的电影界转来的技术和艺术干部，在鸣放运动中，极力否认社会主义电影事业的成绩，污蔑党委和电影局的领导是外行。一部分党员艺术干部，也否认党对电影事业的领导作用，公开宣扬资产阶级艺术至上思想，攻击党不尊重党内的“高级知识分子”。他们主张艺术家治厂，认为电影事业的成绩都是艺术家和导演们的。他们为了向党进攻，结成了封建行班和反党集团，不惜采取和党对抗地闹分厂活动。在这些党内外右派分子互相配合向党猛烈攻击的情况下，文艺报的右派分子锺惦棐又从北京派出爪牙罗斗到长影进行点火，他们企图里应外合，动摇长影这个社会主义的艺术阵地。右派分子还极为狂妄的向上级党委推荐他们认为的“内行”来担任厂长、党委书记等职务。
    由于这些右派分子的活动，长影曾先后发生了几次党团员闹事，上告请愿的反党活动。特别猖狂的是长影乐团的右派分子刘正谭和党内右派分子方振翔等结合起来排除了乐团内的党员整风的领导人，假借“名义”成立了乐团“主席团”，恶毒攻击党的领导，公开地拒绝接受工作任务，破坏了乐团演出和影片的生产计划。刘正谭在“当选”“主席团”以后，极力煽动群众把人民内部矛盾演变为对抗性矛盾，要大家决心干到底。这个右派骨干分子到北京请愿时，还计划鼓动新影乐团和他们一起闹事。
    从6月中旬以来，长影广大群众从各个战线上对右派分子展开了反击，一些被右派分子蒙蔽的群众也开始清醒过来，现在已经有长影乐团、洗印车间、录音车间、行政部门、生产管理部门、编辑处等七个战场和十多个右派分子展开了面对面的说理斗争。有些经过党的长期培养从解放区的文工团员提拔成艺术干部而骄傲自大、堕落变质的右派分子，有的开始低头认罪，有的人还企图和其他右派分子一起坚持反党立场。中共长影党委在省、市委直接指导下，正在进一步整顿队伍，检查党内的右倾思想和温情主义，决心全面深入的开展反右派斗争。
