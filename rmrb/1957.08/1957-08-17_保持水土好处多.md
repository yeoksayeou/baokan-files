　　Gansu, Wushan, Dengjiabao: Over the past five years, it has actively and systematically carried out soil and water conservation work. At present, it has not only basically stopped soil erosion, but also used water storage for irrigation, making water paddies on the mountains and turning many mountains into terraced fields. In 1956, wheat achieved a high yield of 411 jin per mu. The average grain yield per mu was roughly estimated at 80 jin before 1952; it was 310 jin in 1956. The average income of grain per person before 1952 was 382.5 jin; it was 860 jin in 1956.
　　
　　Shanxi, Zhongyang, Louwaigou: Significant benefits were achieved in the same year that soil and water conservation work was carried out: terraced fields increased grain production by 14,087 jin; fish-scale pits and horizontal land steps combined with afforestation and soybean planting on 104 mu produced 4,285 jin; valley dams filled 7 mu of land and produced 297.5 jin; continuous land expansion increased cultivated land by 40 mu and produced 4,100 jin. The total increase in grain production was more than 22,700 jin. In addition, 69 mu of pasture produced approximately 49,600 jin of green grass. Based on the investment of 8,561 workdays, each workday yielded an average of 2.125 jin of grain and 3.6875 jin of green grass in the same year.
　　
　　Shaanxi, Suide, Jiuyuangou: In the past, this gully carried 795,000 metric tons of sediment into the Yellow River via the Wuding River every year. After 1953, under the guidance of the Northwest Yellow River Engineering Bureau of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, local farmers built five large gully earth dams and eighty-six silt-trapping dams in this gully, planted trees and grass on the mountain slopes, and constructed over 15,000 mu of various soil and water conservation field projects. These projects have played a role in controlling soil erosion. In the same degree of rainstorm, the amount of rainwater erosion in this gully was reduced by 41% compared to general untreated gullies, and the mud interception efficiency reached 100%. From 1953 to 1956, these dam projects intercepted a total of 885,000 cubic meters of mud in six or seven major rainstorms. Since then, Jiuyuangou has not only stopped sending sediment to the Yellow River, but also can use the clear water in the gully reservoir to irrigate more than 1,000 mu of land outside the gully during droughts.
　　
　　Sichuan, Chongqing County, Daoming Township: In order to increase land utilization, the entire township began to work on soil and water conservation in 1954. After two years of efforts, more than 2,000 new intercepting ditches, back ditches, and field border ditches, more than 3,000 sand sumps, one sedimentation pond, nine water storage ponds, twenty-seven stone retaining walls, fifty-three valley dams, and seven bamboo cage sand retaining ridges have been built; 14,000 trees have been planted, and 9,000 mu of mountains have been closed for forest protection. In addition, 284 mu of sloping land has been converted into terraced fields. These measures have effectively prevented soil erosion, not only improving the irrigation area by more than 13,000 mu, but also turning more than 400 mu of waterwheel-irrigated fields into self-flowing irrigation, and more than 180 mu of dry land into paddy fields.

    保持水土好处多
    甘肃武山邓家堡：五年来积极地系统地开展了水土保持工作，目前不但基本上制止了水土流失，而且利用蓄水灌溉，使山上有了水田，许多山地变成了梯田。1956年小麦出现每亩四百一十一斤的高额丰产。每亩平均粮食产量据粗算1952年以前是八十斤；1956年为三百一十斤。1952年以前每人平均收入粮食三百八十二点五斤；1956年为八百六十斤。
    山西中阳楼外沟：做了水土保持工作，当年就有显著效益：梯田共增产粮食一万四千零八十七斤；鱼鳞坑水平地阶结合造林种豆一百零四亩，共产四千二百八十五斤；谷坊填地七亩，共产二百九十七点五斤；土地连片扩大耕地四十亩，共产粮食四千一百斤。以上共计增产粮食二万二千七百多斤。另有六十九亩牧草约产青草四万九千六百斤。按投入的八千五百六十一个劳动日计算，平均每个劳动日当年可得粮食二斤十一两，青草三斤十三两。
    陕西绥德韭园沟：过去这条沟内每年经无定河输入黄河的泥沙有七十九万五千公吨。1953年以后，黄河水利委员会西北黄河工程局指导当地农民，在这条沟内修筑了五座大型沟壑土坝和八十六座淤地坝，在山坡上植树种草，以及兴修各种水土保持田间工程一万五千多亩。这些工程已经起了控制水土流失的作用。在同样程度的暴雨里，这条沟内的雨水冲刷量比一般没有治理的沟壑减少了41％，拦泥效率达到100％。从1953年到1956年，这些坝堰工程在六、七次较大的暴雨中，共拦泥八十八万五千公方。从此，韭园沟不仅不再给黄河输送泥沙，而且在天旱时可以利用沟内水库里的清水，灌溉沟外的一千多亩土地。
    四川崇庆县道明乡：为了提高土地利用率，全乡从1954年开始做保持水土工作。经过两年努力，已新挖了两千多条拦山沟、背沟和地边沟，三千多个沙凼，一口沉沙塘，九个蓄水池，二十七处块石挡埂，五十三处谷坊，七座竹笼拦沙埂；并植了一万四千株树，封山护林面积九千亩，还改了二百八十四亩坡地为梯地。这些措施都有效地防止了土壤的流失，不仅改善灌溉面积一万三千多亩，并且还使四百多亩车水田变成自流灌溉，一百八十多亩旱地变成水田。
