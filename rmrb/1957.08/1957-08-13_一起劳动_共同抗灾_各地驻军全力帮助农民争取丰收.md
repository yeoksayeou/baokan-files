Xinhua News Agency, August 11th – People's Liberation Army units stationed in various regions are vigorously supporting agricultural production and helping farmers strive for a bumper harvest.

Since this spring, military units stationed in Jilin Province have extensively organized manpower, livestock, and materials to support agricultural production. According to incomplete statistics from only a few larger units, they have contributed over 100,720 workdays in the past six months, helping agricultural cooperatives with sowing, weeding, planting vegetables, and transplanting rice on an area of 6,658 hectares, building two reservoirs, excavating 34,536 cubic meters of canals, planting 499,233 trees in the spring, and delivering over 800,000 jin of manure to agricultural cooperatives lacking livestock, along with 130 mules and horses. Military units in various regions have also established fixed relationships with local agricultural cooperatives.

Helping agricultural cooperatives with agricultural production has become a daily routine for the Taiyuan garrison. Units stationed in Taiyuan City and 52 agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs of Taiyuan City have direct contact and contracts. In addition to voluntarily gathering at agricultural cooperatives every Sunday to help with weeding, hoeing, and digging ditches, they are always ready to provide support whenever agricultural cooperatives request it during the busy farming season. For example, during spring plowing, summer weeding, and wheat harvesting seasons, each unit has sent people to provide continuous support for several days. In the past six months, officers and soldiers of the units stationed in Taiyuan City have averaged four workdays per person for agricultural cooperatives.

In order to ensure a bumper harvest and not waste an acre of land, military units stationed in Liaoning Province have contributed a large amount of manpower and livestock to help local agricultural cooperatives with plowing, delivering manure, transplanting rice, building reservoirs, and repairing canals. A certain unit stationed in Jinzhou has organized over 31,000 workdays in half a year to help agricultural cooperatives with spring plowing, summer weeding, and water conservancy projects. When the state-owned Panjin Farm suffered severe grass infestation, a certain unit dispatched more than 5,000 officers and soldiers to provide support. After 26 days of intense labor, they removed grass from more than 15,500 mu and transplanted rice on more than 11,000 mu. In half a year, units stationed in Shenyang contributed nearly 30,000 workdays to participate in supporting agricultural production, building shelterbelts, and renovating streets and parks. At the same time, many units have tried their best to save military land and turned it over to the government for allocation to agricultural cooperatives for cultivation.

Since May this year, 26,748 officers and soldiers of the Nanjing garrison have helped the masses build water conservancy projects, pave roads, and participate in various agricultural activities.

Xinhua News Agency, August 11th – Recently, officers and soldiers of the military units stationed in Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang have been assisting the people day and night in flood prevention, disaster relief, and rescue efforts.

The People's Air Force has dispatched 111 sorties, air-dropping 209,700 kilograms of supplies in some disaster-stricken areas of Shandong and Henan. Army units have dispatched large numbers of personnel to participate in flood prevention and rescue operations. More than 1,000 officers and soldiers from a certain unit in the Linyi area repaired the Yi River embankment, ensuring the safety of the breached areas. Their repair of the Dayuzhuang embankment saved 300,000 people in the Cangshan area from disaster. Students from a certain military academy persisted in the flood prevention struggle on a 2,000-meter-long defense line along the Sishui River for more than ten days and nights, preventing the spread of floods. A certain unit in Jining, Jinxiang, Shanxian, and other places used amphibious vehicles, motorboats, assault boats, and pontoon bridges to block breaches, repair embankments, and rescue disaster-stricken people.

Officers and soldiers of the units stationed in the Jiangsu area actively participated in flood prevention and drainage work. When the water level of the Bulao River near the Jiawang Coal Mine rose and the newly built second embankment of the Tuntou River in the mining area was breached, more than 100 soldiers jumped into the chest-deep torrent, linking arms to form three lines of human dikes, persisting for five hours and blocking the flood.

Military hospitals stationed in Zhejiang have been using all their strength to help local agricultural production cooperatives drain water. Water pumps used for firefighting, motors on ships, and other equipment have also been utilized.

Many units' officers and soldiers have taken the initiative to resettle victims after the rescue, some allowing victims to live in barracks, some helping victims repair houses, and also treating the sick and injured for the victims. Some units have also voluntarily donated money and goods to relieve the victims. Students of a certain infantry school in Shandong donated more than 2,040 pieces of clothing and more than 1,290 pairs of shoes and socks for the victims to wear.

The people in the disaster-stricken areas are deeply moved by the active actions and courageous spirit of the People's Liberation Army. Party and government organs of some provinces, cities, special districts, and counties have sent telegrams and letters to express their condolences and gratitude to the officers and soldiers participating in flood prevention and rescue operations.

    一起劳动　共同抗灾
    各地驻军全力帮助农民争取丰收
    新华社11日讯　中国人民解放军驻各地部队大力支援农业生产，帮助农民争取丰收。
    吉林省驻军自今春以来，广泛地组织了人力、畜力和物力，支援农业生产。仅据几个较大单位的不完全统计，半年多来，已做了十万零七千二百多个劳动日，帮助各地农业社播种、锄草、种菜、插秧，面积达六千六百五十八公顷，修水库两座，挖水渠三万四千五百三十六立方公尺，春季植树四十九万九千二百三十三株，送给畜力缺乏的农业社粪肥共八十多万斤，骡马一百三十多匹。各地驻军还同驻地农业社建立了固定联系。
    太原驻军帮助农业社进行农业生产，已经成为日常生活的习惯。驻太原市各部队和太原市郊区的五十二个农业社都有直接联系，并订有合同。他们除每星期日主动集合到农业社帮助锄苗、拔草、挖渠外，农忙时节，只要农业社提出要求，都有求必应，赶赴支援。如在春耕翻地，夏季锄苗、割麦时节，各单位都连续几天派人支援。半年来，驻太原市部队官兵平均每人已为农业社作了四个劳动日。
    辽宁省驻军为了保证农业大丰收，不荒废一亩地，许多部队都拿出大批人力、畜力帮助驻地农业社耕地、送粪、插秧、修水库和修水渠。驻锦州某部，半年内已组织了三万一千多个劳动日，帮助农业社春耕、夏锄和兴修水利。国营盘锦农场草荒严重时，某部出动了五千多名官兵赶往支援，经过二十六天的紧张劳动，共除草一万五千五百多亩，插秧一万一千多亩。驻沈阳部队半年内以近三万个劳动日，参加了支援农业生产、营造防护林、整修街道和公园的劳动。同时，许多部队还尽量节省军事用地，腾出地来交给政府拨给农业社耕种。
    南京驻军今年5月以来已有二万六千七百四十八人分别帮助群众兴修水利，铺筑道路和参加各种农事活动。
    新华社11日讯　最近，山东、河南、江苏和浙江等地驻军的广大官兵，夜以继日地协助人民群众防汛、抢险和救灾。
    人民空军已出动飞机一百一十一架次，在山东、河南部分受灾地区空投物资二十万九千七百多公斤。陆军部队出动了大批人员投入防汛、抢险。某部队千余人在临沂地区抢修沂河堤坝，保证了决口险地的安全。由于他们抢修了大庾庄堤坝，使苍山地区的三十万人民免于灾难。某军事学校的学员，在泗水河两千公尺长的防线上，坚持了十多昼夜的防汛斗争，防止了洪水蔓延。某部队在济宁、金乡、单县等地，用水陆汽车、汽艇、操舟机、舟桥堵口修堤，救出受灾群众。
    驻江苏地区的部队官兵，积极参加了防汛排涝工作。当贾汪煤矿附近不牢河的水位上涨、矿区屯头河新筑起的第二道堤坝被冲开的时候，一百多名战士跳下漫胸的激流，胳臂挽胳臂，连结成三道人堤，坚持五小时，堵住洪水。
    驻浙江的军医院，以全力帮助当地农业生产合作社排涝，救火用的抽水机、轮船上的马达等器材，也都利用起来。
    许多部队的官兵，在抢险之后主动安置灾民，有的让灾民进营房居住，有的帮助灾民修房子，还为灾民医病治伤。有些部队还自动捐献钱物，救济灾民。山东某步兵学校的学员，捐出两千零四十多件衣服和一千二百九十多双鞋袜，给灾民穿用。
    各地灾区人民对人民解放军的积极行动和勇敢精神深受感动。有些省、市、专署和县的党、政机关，纷纷打电报和写信，对参加防汛、抢险的部队官兵进行慰问和表示感谢。
