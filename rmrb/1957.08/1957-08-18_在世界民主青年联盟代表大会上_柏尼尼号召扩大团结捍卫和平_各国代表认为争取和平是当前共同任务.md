Xinhua News Agency, Kiev, August 17th - According to TASS: World Federation of Democratic Youth (WFDY) President Bernini delivered a report at the Fourth WFDY Congress on August 16th entitled “Youth, the Modern World, and the Tasks of the World Federation of Democratic Youth” (previously translated as “Today's Youth and the World Federation of Democratic Youth”).

In his report, Bernini discussed the work done by the WFDY in the past four years in calling on youth to unite against the atomic threat, strengthen friendly ties, and defend peace. He said that the recently concluded Sixth World Youth and Student Festival for Peace and Friendship proved that the WFDY had done much work in striving for cooperation with youth organizations from various countries and international organizations. This festival was a new contribution by our younger generation to overcoming world division, easing international tensions, and the cause of peaceful coexistence among nations.

When discussing the tasks of the WFDY, Bernini emphasized that cooperation among all youth organizations must be developed more profoundly. This will help to quickly solve youth problems and enable youth to make valuable contributions to the cause of peaceful development of mankind.

Bernini said that in recent years, the forms of cooperation between various youth organizations have become more and more numerous. We believe that today, at the international level, youth organizations can and should find realistic ways to work together to help governments and push them towards consultation, mutual understanding, and peace. In order to give cooperation the necessary global scale, the best way is for all international youth organizations to sign agreements. He also talked about the importance of expanding international exchanges and cultural exchange for educating the younger generation.

Bernini pointed out that the European question must be resolved to overcome the adverse consequences caused by the current division, and the danger of atomic armament must be eliminated.

He also talked about the following issues of concern to the youth of Asian and African countries: the United Nations recognizing the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China, the unification of Korea and Vietnam, the incorporation of Taiwan, Goa, and West Irian into their respective countries, and the resolution of the Middle East issue. Bernini pointed out that various proposals have been put forward to properly resolve these issues, such as dissolving all military blocs and signing an Asian collective security treaty, etc. Many European youth organizations, especially those in the countries with colonies, also agree with this proposition.

Bernini emphasized the current danger of colonialism to the cause of peace, and said that we believe that youth organizations are able to sign anti-colonial agreements today.

Bernini stressed that efforts should be made to jointly solve the problems of common concern of striving for coexistence and world peace. The WFDY believes that this great cause falls on the shoulders of all youth organizations. The youth organizations of the United States and the Soviet Union bear a special responsibility. He said that we sincerely welcome and support the proposal of the Soviet Youth Organizations Committee to hold a meeting with the youth organizations of the United States, and we hope that the American youth organizations will accept this proposal.

Bernini then talked about the draft of the new charter of the WFDY. He said that the essence and strength of the WFDY lies in that it is different from many other organizations in that its measures are open to everyone's participation, and its purpose is to better serve the interests of youth for peace and friendship. He expressed his belief that more and more new and powerful forces will join the WFDY on this path.

Xinhua News Agency, Kiev, August 17th - According to TASS: The WFDY Congress began to discuss the report given by Bernini on behalf of the WFDY Executive Committee on the evening of August 16th.

The first speaker was K. Eshar (France). He said that the WFDY should strive to unite all democratic forces, strengthen the struggle to stop testing atomic and hydrogen weapons, establish a reliable collective security system, and prevent war.

T. Virgil (Romania) said in his speech that cooperation among youth around the world should be strengthened. He said that the WFDY should expand its ties with the youth of colonial countries. He also suggested organizing a festival for the youth of the Danube countries.

M. Aime (Middle Congo) made an impassioned speech at the conference. He said that the people of French-ruled Equatorial Africa are on the eve of a major change. They are determined to get rid of the shackles of colonialism and strive for national independence. The recently established Congo Youth League is playing a significant role in this regard.

Italian Socialist Youth representative E. Egori said in his speech that the organization of the WFDY must be further strengthened to make it more representative. He believed that all youth organizations have some common tasks, such as striving for peace and eliminating military blocs. He suggested that European youth hold meetings for cooperation and unity, and strive to unite all forces fighting for peace.

An observer from the French West African Youth Groups, K. Mausa, said that African youth will always cooperate with those organizations that oppose colonialism.

The delegates listened carefully to the speech by R. Conf (West Germany). He pointed out the special significance of the peace issue for West German youth. He said that there is a faction in West Germany that is trying to launch an atomic war. He suggested issuing an appeal to youth and people all over the world, to governments of various countries, and to the United Nations, demanding the cessation of testing and the prohibition of nuclear weapons.

Syrian youth representative W. Faisal spoke of the Arab countries' youth's yearning for peace, and of their struggle against the conspiracies of imperialist countries in the Middle East.

    在世界民主青年联盟代表大会上
    柏尼尼号召扩大团结捍卫和平
    各国代表认为争取和平是当前共同任务
    新华社17日讯  据塔斯社基辅讯：世界民主青年联盟主席柏尼尼8月16日在第四届世界民主青年联盟代表大会上作了关于“青年、现代世界和世界民主青年联盟的任务”（前译作“今日的青年和世界民主青年联盟的任务”）的报告。
    柏尼尼在报告中谈到了四年来世界民主青年联盟在号召青年联合起来反对原子威胁、加强友好联系和捍卫和平等方面所进行的工作。他说，最近闭幕的第六届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节证明了世界民主青年联盟在争取同各国的以及国际的青年组织合作方面进行了许多工作。这一届联欢节是我们青年一代对克服世界分裂、缓和国际紧张局势和各国和平共处事业所作的新贡献。
    柏尼尼在谈到联盟的任务的时候强调指出，必须更加深刻地发展所有青年组织的合作。这样才有助于迅速地解决青年问题和使青年对人类的和平发展事业作出宝贵的贡献。
    柏尼尼说，最近几年以来，各种青年组织间的合作形式越来越多了。我们认为今天在国际范围内，青年组织能够、而且应该寻找现实的途径来共同努力合作，帮助政府和推动它们走向协商、相互谅解和和平的道路。为了使合作具有必要的世界规模，最好的途径是一切国际青年组织签订协议。他还谈到扩大国际交往和文化交流对教育青年一代的重要意义。
    柏尼尼指出，必须解决欧洲问题以克服目前的分裂状态所造成的不良后果，必须消除原子军备的危险。
    他还谈到亚非国家青年所关心的下列问题：联合国承认中华人民共和国的合法权利，朝鲜和越南的统一，台湾、果阿和西伊里安归并于其本国，以及解决中东问题。柏尼尼指出，为了使这些问题得到妥善解决，已经提出了各种建议，例如，解散一切军事集团和签订亚洲集体安全条约等等。许多欧洲青年组织，特别是宗主国国家的青年组织也同意这种主张。
    柏尼尼强调指出了目前殖民主义对和平事业的危险，并且说，我们认为今天各个青年组织间有条件签订反对殖民主义的协议。
    柏尼尼强调指出，应当设法共同努力解决大家所关心争取共处和世界和平的问题。世界民主青年联盟认为这个伟大的事业落在一切青年组织的肩上。美国和苏联的青年组织尤其负有特别的责任。他说，我们竭诚欢迎并且支持苏联青年组织委员会主张同美国的青年组织举行会见的建议，我们希望美国青年组织接受这个建议。
    柏尼尼接着谈到了联盟的新章程草案。他说，联盟的本质和它的力量在于：它不同于许多其他组织，它的措施是欢迎一切人参与的；它的目的是为了和平和友谊更好地为青年的利益服务。他表示相信，在这条道路上将有越来越多的新的强大力量参加世界民主青联。
    新华社17日讯  据塔斯社基辅讯：世界民主青年联盟代表大会在8月16日晚间开始讨论柏尼尼代表联盟执行委员会所作的报告。
    第一个发言的是克·埃沙尔（法国）。他说，世界民主青联应该努力团结一切民主力量，为停止试验原子武器和氢武器、为建立一个可靠的集体安全体系、为防止战争而加强斗争。
    特·维吉尔（罗马尼亚）在发言中说，应该加强全世界青年的合作。他说，世界民主青联应该扩大同殖民地国家青年的联系。他还建议组织一次多瑙河沿岸国家青年的联欢会。
    马·艾梅（中刚果）在大会上作了激动人心的发言。他说，在法国统治下的赤道非洲的人民处在大变动的前夕。他们坚决要摆脱殖民主义的桎梏，争取民族独立。不久前成立的刚果青年联盟在这方面起着不小的作用。
    意大利社会党青年代表埃·埃戈利在发言中谈到，必须进一步加强世界民主青联的组织，使它具有更大的代表性。他认为，所有的青年组织都有一些共同的任务，如争取和平、消除军事集团等。他建议欧洲青年为合作和团结举行会见，争取把一切为和平而斗争的力量团结起来。
    法属西非洲青年团体的观察员基·毛萨说，非洲青年将永远同那些反对殖民主义的组织进行合作。
    代表们仔细听取了理·孔夫（西德）的发言。他指出和平问题对西德青年的特殊意义。他说，西德中有一派企图发动原子战争的势力。他建议向全世界青年和社会人士，向各国政府和联合国发出呼吁，要求停止试验并禁止核武器。
    叙利亚青年代表瓦·费萨尔说到阿拉伯国家的青年渴望和平，说到他们对帝国主义国家在中东的阴谋进行斗争的情形。
