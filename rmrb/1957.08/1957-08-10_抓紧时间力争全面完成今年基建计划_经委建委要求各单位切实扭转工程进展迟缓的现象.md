    Seize the Time and Strive to Comprehensively Complete This Year's Infrastructure Plan
    Economic and Construction Commissions Require All Units to Resolutely Reverse the Phenomenon of Slow Project Progress
    (Our Newspaper) Beijing, August 9th. The State Economic Commission and the State Construction Commission jointly issued a circular to all central ministries on the 9th, requiring all units to take effective measures to reverse the phenomenon of slow progress in basic construction projects and strive to comprehensively complete this year's basic construction plan.
    The national basic construction plan for the first half of this year was not completed well enough. The total investment completed only 33.3% of the annual plan, and the construction and installation workload completed only 35.3% of the annual plan. Many key projects are in danger of being completed behind schedule. Of the projects contracted by the Ministry of Construction Engineering for the Second Ministry of Machine Building, 18 key projects were required to be put into production in the first half of the year, but only six were completed according to plan. The Ministry of Coal Industry planned to start construction of 28 new mines throughout the year, but only three were started in the first half of the year; none of the seven coal washing plants planned to be newly built this year started construction in the first half of the year, and the supply of main plant drawings will mostly be delayed, making it very likely that the plan will not be completed this year. Many power plants under the Ministry of Electric Power have not completed their construction plans, such as the Qingshan and Xigu thermal power plants, which were originally planned to generate electricity in the second quarter, but now will be delayed to the third quarter; according to the Ministry's preliminary estimates, the planned power generation capacity to be put into production this year may also not be completed if necessary measures are not taken. Many key projects of the metallurgical, chemical and other ministries are also delayed.
    The reason why the basic construction plan for the first half of this year was not completed well is partly due to the late issuance of the plan. However, the important reason is that the leading personnel of many construction units and construction and installation enterprises and their management departments have a relaxed attitude, thinking that "this year's task is small, the strength is great, and there is no problem in completing the plan," and therefore relaxed their leadership, lacked timely inspection of the implementation of the plan, and did not grasp the progress of the project tightly. For example, the Wangting Power Plant of the Ministry of Electric Power was able to complete more than 900,000 yuan of investment projects per month in the fourth quarter of last year, but in the first quarter of this year, under the same construction conditions, it only completed more than 400,000 yuan per month; after the Ministry sent a working group to inspect and help solve the problem, it completed 1 million yuan in the second half of March. There are also some shortcomings in construction cooperation. Because Party A and Party B have some different opinions on the handling of issues such as contracting methods, financial settlement, and planned progress, many projects often "haggle" over many small issues, get entangled, and contracts cannot be signed for a long time, affecting the arrangement and progress of both parties' work. The general contractor and the subcontractor also do not cooperate well in construction, and the plans are not coordinated enough, thus prolonging the date of delivery of the entire project for production. In addition, in implementing the policy of "building the country with diligence and thrift," some departments have not conducted specific and in-depth research on various projects, and have not well combined increasing production and practicing economy with the current construction work. Some units have neglected the progress of the project when revising the design, making it impossible for some projects to be constructed according to plan.
    Some departments have already noticed this situation. The Ministry of Electric Power, the Ministry of Chemical Industry, the Ministry of Coal Industry and other ministries have recently held basic construction meetings of their affiliated units to check the implementation of the plan in the first half of the year and made appropriate arrangements for completing the annual plan.
    After analyzing the above situation, the circular of the State Economic Commission and the State Construction Commission pointed out that there are currently less than five months left until the end of the year. To comprehensively complete this year's basic construction plan, all units need to make great efforts. The circular put forward the following specific requirements to all units: (1) All departments must reverse all kinds of relaxed thinking and strive to comprehensively complete this year's basic construction plan. Through checking the implementation of the plan, further make reasonable arrangements for the plan in the second half of the year. (2) Strengthen cooperation, especially between Party A and Party B, and between the general contractor and the subcontractor. All units should support each other and jointly deal with specific problems in the work with the completion of the plan as the criterion. Party A and Party B can organize joint inspection teams to go deep into the grassroots units to check and deal with all problems in the implementation of the plan. (3) Further implement the policy of "building the country with diligence and thrift" in basic construction. All departments should put forward plans to save investment in accordance with the "Instructions on Further Developing the Movement to Increase Production and Practice Economy" issued by the State Council on June 4, and at the same time conduct a comprehensive inspection of the work of practicing economy in the first half of the year at the grassroots units to correct the wasteful phenomena that still exist in some units. (4) While correcting relaxed thinking and striving to comprehensively complete the annual basic construction plan, it is necessary to prevent the tendency of disregarding project quality and safety, so as to avoid causing new losses.

### 抓紧时间力争全面完成今年基建计划  经委建委要求各单位切实扭转工程进展迟缓的现象

    抓紧时间力争全面完成今年基建计划
    经委建委要求各单位切实扭转工程进展迟缓的现象
    本报讯　国家经济委员会和国家建设委员会9日联合向中央各部发出通报，要求各单位采取有效措施扭转基本建设工程进展迟缓的现象，争取全面完成今年的基本建设计划。
    今年上半年全国基本建设计划完成得不够好。总投资额仅完成全年计划的33.3％，建筑安装工作量仅完成全年计划的35.3％，不少重点工程有拖期完成的危险。建筑工程部承包的第二机械工业部的工程中，要求上半年投入生产的重点工程有十八项，按计划完成的只有六项。煤炭工业部全年计划开工建设新井二十八处，上半年只开工三处；今年计划新建的七个洗煤厂，上半年一个也没有开工，主厂房图纸的供应大部分要拖期，今年完不成计划的危险性很大。电力工业部有很多电站没有完成施工计划，如青山、西固热电站原计划第二季发电，现在要拖到第三季度；据该部初步估计，今年投入生产的发电能力计划，如果不采取必要措施也可能完不成。冶金、化工等部的重点工程，不少也有拖期现象。
    今年上半年的基本建设计划所以完成得不好，计划下达得迟是一个原因。但是，重要的原因是不少建设单位和建筑安装企业及其管理部门的领导人员存在着一种“今年任务少，力量大，完成计划没有问题”的松劲思想，因而放松了领导，对计划执行缺少及时的检查，对工程进度抓得不紧。如电力工业部望亭电厂去年第四季度每月能完成九十多万元投资的工程，今年第一季度在同样施工条件下，每月却只完成四十多万元；经过部里派工作组检查并帮助解决问题以后，3月份下半月就完成了一百万元。在施工协作方面，也有一些缺点。甲方和乙方由于在承包方式、财务结算和计划进度等问题的处理上有某些不同的意见，不少工程经常在很多细小问题上“扯皮”，纠缠不清，合同迟迟订不下来，影响了双方工作的安排和进行。总分包在施工中有的也配合得不好，计划不够协调，因而拖长了整个工程交付生产的日期。另外，在贯彻“勤俭建国”方针方面，有些部门没有对各项工程进行具体深入的研究，没有把增产节约同当前的建设工作很好地结合起来，有的单位在修改设计的时候就忽视了工程进度，使一些工程不能按计划施工。
    这一情况，有些部门已经注意到了。电力、化工、煤炭等部最近都开过所属单位的基本建设会议，检查了上半年计划的执行情况，对完成全年计划作了适当的安排。
    国家经济委员会、国家建设委员会的通报在分析了上述情况以后指出：目前到年底还只有不到五个月的时间，要想全面完成今年的基本建设计划，需要各单位作巨大的努力。通报中对各单位提出了下述的具体要求：（一）各部门必须扭转各种各样的松劲思想，争取全面完成今年基本建设计划。通过检查计划的执行情况，进一步对下半年计划进行合理的安排。（二）加强协作，特别是甲乙方、总分包之间的协作。各单位应相互支援，共同以完成计划为准则来处理工作中的具体问题。甲乙双方可以组织联合检查组深入基层单位，检查、处理在计划执行中的一切问题。（三）进一步在基本建设中贯彻“勤俭建国”的方针。各部门应按照国务院6月4日所发“关于进一步开展增产节约运动”的指示，提出节约投资的方案，同时深入基层单位对上半年的节约工作作一次全面检查，以纠正某些单位仍然存在的浪费现象。（四）在纠正松劲思想、争取全面完成年度基本建设计划的同时，应当防止发生不顾工程质量和安全的偏向，以免造成新的损失。
