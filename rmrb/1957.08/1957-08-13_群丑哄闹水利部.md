A Motley Crew Makes a Scene at the Ministry of Water Resources
By our reporter Hui Zhi

After the rectification campaign began, a group of rightists emerged in various units of the Ministry of Water Resources. Under the guise of "helping the Party rectify," they stirred up trouble, attempting to overthrow the leadership of the Party.

Twenty-Two Reactionary Poems

Gao Yan (member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang), a rightist element in the Bureau of Farmland Water Conservancy, had consistently expressed dissatisfaction since he started working. When the blooming and contending began, he thought his chance to "rectify" the Communist Party had come. At a forum for democratic personages convened by the Party Group of the Ministry of Water Resources, he first proposed:
  "Unqualified Party members should be purged." Looking at this sentence alone, it doesn't seem to have much wrong with it; looking at the following text, the fox's tail is revealed. He said, "In reality, good Party members are in the minority. Many Party members are immoral, corrupt, just like the police in the old society, making people feel scared."
    In addition to verbal attacks, Gao Yan also wrote twenty-two seven-character poems, scolding the Communist Party and the new China it led. He slandered the great suppression of counterrevolutionaries movement, saying: "Startling wind and rain wildly swayed, suppressing counterrevolutionaries lightly wielded the pen." He also used words such as "literary inquisition" and "trumped-up charge" to compare the Party to Qin Hui, who murdered the national hero Yue Fei. He scolded leading cadres as "eating meat without strategy, only consuming plain meals, regardless of the size of the matter, they seek out clerks." He scolded Party members as "promoted and given salary increases, enjoying welfare, Party members always come before others." He slandered newspapers as "only reporting good news, not bad," and "anonymous people find it hard to get their manuscripts published."
    Gao Yan had been a person who didn't engage in proper work since he was a child. At the age of fifteen, he worked as a clerk in a bandit team in his hometown. He successively participated in eight reactionary organizations, serving as an official of the reactionary faction as a bureau chief and commissioner, and had connections with Li Zongren, Zhang Yinwu, and others. After liberation, he participated in work. He said regretfully: "Now it is not like the past, one must work, one can no longer go home to be an old landlord."

The Cunning Old Fox

Gao Yan's reactionary poems were "corrected" by some "high-level people." Zhang Tengxiao (member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang), an editor of water conservancy history, was one of them. After reading these poems, Zhang Tengxiao wrote: "Every poem is excellent, speaking the words in everyone's heart." But when people launched criticism of the reactionary poems, he cunningly said: I only read the beginning and end of Gao Yan's poems, I didn't read the middle. What I wrote was "the beginning and end are excellent."
    Zhang Tengxiao also slandered, saying: "Ordinary Party members, especially leaders, love to listen to petty reports." He scolded the people who made petty reports as the most shameless, and the people who listened to petty reports as the most incompetent. He said that the Kitchen God's notebook made him walk far away. Rightist elements in the Water Conservancy Science Research Institute posted wall posters under the name "Turen" (土人, roughly "local") to viciously scold the Communist Party. When this wall poster was criticized by the masses and discontinued, Zhang Tengxiao wrote an article inciting, saying: I didn't expect "Turen" to be so fragile and unable to withstand the test. And he wanted it to "resume publication as soon as possible and fight forward." He also used his identity as the leader of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang group to convene secret meetings with some people who were dissatisfied with the Party, collecting anti-Party opinions, and actively developing organizations among backward elements. When people questioned his words and deeds, not only did he not examine his own mistakes, but he also painted his anti-Party remarks as "unpleasant" words.

A Person Who Would Rather Die Than Be Reformed

Li Yu, another rightist element in the Bureau of Farmland Water Conservancy, openly slandered our Party's leader, saying that Chairman Mao's poems contained individual heroism. He also incoherently said that Chairman Mao might not be completely correct, Li Lisan's line might not necessarily be wrong, Marxism-Leninism might not necessarily be applicable to all corners of the world, and if there was no Marxism-Leninism, there might be a better ideology. He also believed that not participating in the Party or League was "happiness." Where exactly did his interests lie? It turned out that this person who was not interested in the Party or League had joined the Three People's Principles Youth League more than ten years ago. He falsely claimed that the lives of the common people in the countryside were even more difficult than under the Kuomintang, and he demanded the abolition of the county committee. He also said that the Communist Party was a fake democracy and only liked people who flattered. Guo Moruo was so popular because he knew how to flatter.
    When people announced his remarks and criticized him, he said: It's okay if my opinions are not announced, but if they are announced, I will never be reformed until I die. I think you will have to let me live somehow.
    Obviously, his demand was to let his anti-Party remarks run rampant freely, and if he was to be criticized, he would never change until he died. This was completely stubborn resistance. No matter how rogue the rightist elements act, people will not let him go.

The Echo in the Party

When the rightist elements were frantically attacking the Party, impure elements within the Party played the role of internal support. Ban Xiaohou, a Communist Party member of the Technical Committee, played such a role. He believed that Party members were indeed ruthless to their relatives, and that the fact that some people did not support the elderly was inseparable from the Party's education. He said that the Party educated Party members to draw a clear ideological line, which meant asking them to break away from their families. He said that his confidants were not in the Party, and he did not have deep feelings for Party members. The Party's education made Party members rigid and obsequious.
    Some people found it strange that this young man, only twenty-four years old and having joined the Party for more than four years, had so many absurd fallacies. It was very simple. He came from a bureaucratic landlord family and had developed a vain mentality since he was a child. After liberation, he pretended to be active and sneaked into the Party. Afraid of making a bad impression on the organization, he was obsequious everywhere. Over time, he felt that joining the Party could not achieve his individualistic goals, and he was also uncomfortable constantly putting on airs. Taking advantage of the rectification opportunity, he attributed all his pretenses to the Party's "education." When the truth was exposed, he turned out to be an untouched "young master."

    * * *

    Various units of the Ministry of Water Resources had successively conducted some criticisms of the anti-Party remarks of rightist elements in June and July. Rightist elements generally admitted their mistakes on the surface but did not conduct deep self-examinations. Now, various units of the Ministry of Water Resources are launching a large-scale pursuit, continuing to expose and criticize rightist elements, not allowing them to muddle through.

### 群丑哄闹水利部

    群丑哄闹水利部
    本报记者　慧之
    整风运动开始后，水利部各单位先后出现了一批右派分子。他们打着“帮助党整风”的招牌，兴风作浪，企图推翻党的领导。
    二十二首反动诗
    农田水利局右派分子高炎（民革成员），参加工作以来，一贯表现不满。鸣放开始他认为“整”共产党的机会到了，在水利部党组召开的民主人士座谈会上他首先提出：
  “不够条件的党员应该清洗。”单看这么一句话，似乎没有多大毛病；再看下文，狐狸尾巴就露出来了。他说：“实际上好党员是少数，很多党员都缺德、贪污腐化，像旧社会的警察一样，使人见而生畏。”
    除口头攻击以外，高炎又写了二十二首七言诗，把共产党和她所领导的新中国大骂一通。他诬蔑伟大的肃反运动说：“惊心风雨大飘摇，肃反轻挥笔下刀”，他还用“三字狱”、“莫须有”等字样，把党比作谋杀民族英雄的秦桧。他骂领导干部是“肉吃无谋只素餐，事无大小找科员”。骂党员是“晋级加薪享福利，党员事事在人前”。污蔑报纸是“只闻报喜不报忧”，“无名小卒稿难投”。
    高炎自小就是个不务正业的人，十五岁时曾在家乡土匪队当过文书，先后共参加过八个反动组织，做过局长、专员等反动派的官，并和李宗仁、张荫吾等有过联系，解放后参加了工作。他悔恨地说：“现在不比过去，非工作不行，再也不能回家作老员外了。”
    狡猾的老狐狸
    高炎的反动诗是经过一些“高人”“指正”的。水利史编辑张腾霄（民革成员）便是其中之一。张腾霄看过这些诗后批上“首首俱佳，道出了人人心里话。”可是当人们对反动诗展开批判时，他却狡猾地说：高炎的诗我只看了个首尾，当中没有看。批的是“首尾俱佳”几个字。
    张腾霄还诽谤说：“一般党员尤其是领导，专爱听小报告”。他骂作小报告的人最无耻，听小报告的人最无能。他说灶王爷的小本子，使得他走路都要离远些。水利科学研究院的右派分子以“土人”为名贴墙报毒骂共产党，当这个墙报受到群众指责停刊时，张腾霄却写文章煽动说：没想到“土人”竟如此脆弱，经不起考验。并要它“早日复刊，向前奋斗”。他还利用民革小组长的身份，召集一些对党不满分子开秘密会议，收集反党意见，并在落后分子中积极发展组织。当人们对他这些言行提出责问时，他不仅不检查自己的错误，反把自己的反党言论粉饰为“逆耳”之言。
    死也不愿改造的人
    农田水利局的另一个右派分子李域，公开污蔑我们党的领袖，说毛主席的诗中有个人英雄主义。还语无伦次地说毛主席不一定完全正确，李立三路线不一定就是错误，马列主义不一定放之四海而皆准，如果没有马列主义，可能还有更好的主义。他还认为没参加党团是
  “幸福”。他的兴趣究竟在哪儿呢？原来这位对党团不感兴趣的人在十多年前就参加了三青团。他诬称目前乡下老百姓的生活比国民党时还苦，他要求取消县委会。他还说共产党是假民主，只喜欢拍马屁的人。郭沫若所以红，就是因为会拍马。
    人们公布他的言论并进行批判的时候，他又说：不公布我的意见还可，公布出来，我至死也不会改造，我看怎样也得让我生活。
    很明显，他的要求是让他的反党言论自由泛滥，要对他进行批判，他就死也不改了。这完全是死赖顽抗。不管右派分子怎样耍无赖，人们是不会放过他的。
    党内的应声虫
    在右派分子向党猖狂进攻的时候，党内的不纯分子起了内应的作用。技术委员会共产党员班效侯就充当了这样一个角色。他认为党员的确是六亲不认，有些人不养老人是和党的教育分不开的。他说党教育党员划清思想界限，就是叫他脱离家庭。他说他的知心朋友不在党内，他和党员没有深厚的感情。党的教育使党员死板，唯唯诺诺。
    有人觉得奇怪，这个年仅二十四岁、已入党四年多的青年人，为什么有这样多的荒唐谬论呢？说起来也很简单，原来他出身在一个官僚地主的家庭里，自小就养成爱虚荣的心理，解放后伪装积极，混进了党，又怕组织上有不好印象，便到处唯唯诺诺。久而久之，他感到入党并不能达到个人主义的目的，经常装腔作势也很不舒服，乘整风机会，便把自己的一切伪装，都说成是党的“教育”。真象暴露，他原来是个原封未动的“小少爷”。
                ＊　＊　＊
    水利部各单位对右派分子的反党言论，在六、七月间已先后进行了一些批判。右派分子一般都表面认错，但不进行深刻检查。现在水利部各单位正展开了声势浩大的追击，继续揭露和批判右派分子，不许他们蒙混过关。
