    Nanjing's paper-cuts
    Zhang Wenjun
    The characteristics of Nanjing paper-cuts can be simply described as "rough," "clumsy," and "lively." The formation of this style is determined by the content of the paper-cuts, traditional appreciation habits, and the artistic creation of the paper-cut artists. Zhang Jigen, who has twenty-six years of paper-cutting experience, said: "When I cut paper, I don't just want it to be realistic, but mainly to be fun and have flavor." Someone wanted him to change his style and cut paper-cuts like Zhang Yongshou of Yangzhou. He said that cutting finely and realistically does not necessarily mean beauty. If a cow's entire body of hair is meticulously cut out, but the essence of the cow is not captured, it can only be regarded as technical precision, not artistic refinement. The paper-cut artists of Nanjing pursue a paper-cut interest that unifies clumsiness and agility (including precise depiction), to achieve an artistic effect that is "fun" and has a beautiful flavor. How can it be considered flavorful? Zhang Jigen said that whether cutting figures, animals, or flowers and birds, the spirit and emotion must be cut out to meet the standard. For example, "Cowherd Playing the Flute" should be cut so that the cowherd and the old cow look like good friends. The old cow carries the cowherd, and the cowherd plays the flute for the old cow, showing that they are harmonious and affectionate. Others such as "Goldfish Playing with Lotus" and "Double Happiness Meeting," the goldfish or magpies snuggling and calling to each other, also seem to be talking and chatting there. Therefore, Zhang Jigen is particularly interested in seeing children carrying small stools as babies, or children riding fish lanterns during the Spring Festival, and other similar actions and expressions. His paper-cut "Pomegranate Showing Seeds," "Child Riding a Fish," and so on, all embody this taste of children's life.
    The external characteristics of Nanjing paper-cuts are short and thick, round, chubby, and clumsy. If we carefully appreciate Wang Mingchang's "Double Fish Leaping Over the Dragon Gate," Wu Lao Tai's "Autumn Insects, Hibiscus, and Reeds," and Zhang Jigen's "Lotus Giving Birth to a Noble Son," they all have the simple, honest, and beautiful taste of folk art and the above-mentioned characteristics.
    Paper-cut artists like Zhang Jigen, Wang Mingchang, and Wu Lao Tai have always been engaged in paper-cutting as a profession, passed down from generation to generation. Wu Lao Tai started learning paper-cutting as a young girl and has been cutting for more than fifty years. Wang Mingchang learned from his grandfather and father in his childhood. Zhang Jigen's teachers were his maternal grandmother and uncle. Due to years of practical training, they have all mastered skillful techniques. They can cut very accurately without using ink to draw drafts, reaching a level of proficiency. The喜花 (decorative paper cuttings) they cut have received good reviews both at home and abroad. They all take paper-cutting as their profession and have a strong interest in their work. Zhang Jigen has been cutting for more than twenty years, and although he has cut a lot, he considers only a few dozen kinds to be satisfactory. A good paper-cut is a creation that requires multiple considerations and refinements. For example, the small paper-cut "Child Holding a Fish" has been revised more than twenty times before he finally felt satisfied. He said that it takes a lot of thought to cut a paper-cut that looks fun and interesting.
    The main uses of paper-cuts are: first, as embroidery patterns, called "花样" (patterns), including shoe patterns, hat patterns, pillow patterns, etc.; second, "喜花" (decorative paper cuttings), used for weddings and celebrations. Combined with certain uses, the content of paper-cuts mostly uses symbolic methods, taking homophonic puns to express auspicious and festive meanings. Such as "福 (蝙蝠 - bat) 寿 (蟠桃 - peach) 双全 (双古钱 - two ancient coins)" (meaning "blessings and longevity complete"), "吉 (百结 - hundred knots) 庆 (磬 - chime stone) 有余 (鱼 - fish)" (meaning "auspicious celebrations with abundance"), "双双对对 (两对鸳鸯 - two pairs of mandarin ducks)" (meaning "couples"), etc., expressing the people's desire for a beautiful and happy life.
    The basic training of paper-cutting is divided into three aspects: "round," "sharp," and "gap." "Round" refers to the general shape of the flower, "sharp" and "gap" refer to the symmetrical distance between the flower tips and petals. These basic shapes must be practiced repeatedly to express them freely and grasp them accurately. Whether cutting figures, animals, or flowers and birds, they are cut from bottom to top and from left to right (this is for convenience). If it is a more complex composition, whether its shape is square or round, it is cut from the inside out. These are basic methods.
    In order to inherit and develop Nanjing's paper-cut art, under the guidance of the cultural leadership departments of Nanjing City, the artists organized the Folk Paper-Cutting Craft Production Cooperative in 1955 (now under the leadership of the handicraft department), which currently has seventeen members. Zhang Jigen, Wang Mingchang, and Wu Lao Tai have all joined the cooperative, and Zhang Jigen serves as the director of the cooperative. In order to improve the artistic quality of paper-cuts, they request that comrades from the cultural departments and art circles give more help and care. (Attached pictures)

    南京的剪纸
    张文俊
    南京剪纸的特点，简单的说就是“粗”“笨”“灵”。这种风格特点的形成，是由剪纸的内容、传统的欣赏习惯，以及剪纸艺人的艺术创造所决定的。已经有二十六年剪纸经验的张吉根说：“我剪纸不只是要像，主要的是要好玩，有味道。”有人要他改变自己的风格，改剪扬州张永寿那样的剪纸，他说剪得细、剪得像并不一定就是美的，把一条牛全身的毛都细细地剪出来，而没有剪出牛的味道，那也只能算是技术上的细致、而不是艺术上的细致。南京剪纸艺人所追求的剪纸趣味，是要把笨拙与灵巧（包括刻划精细）二者统一起来，达到“好玩”而具有优美趣味的艺术效果。怎样才算有味道呢？张吉根说，不论剪人物、动物或花鸟，要把神气情感剪出来才算够标准，如“牧童吹笛”，应该把牧童和老牛剪成是好朋友的样子，老牛驮着牧童走，牧童吹着笛子给老牛听，要表现出他们很和谐而有情意。其他如“金鱼戏荷”、“双喜相逢”，金鱼或喜鹊相互偎依呼唤之情，也都好像在那里谈心、讲话。所以张吉根在平时看到小孩子背着小板凳当小宝宝玩，或在春节看到儿童骑着鱼灯跑，以及其他类似这样的动作神情时，就特别感到兴趣，他剪的喜花“榴开见子”、“童子骑鱼”等等，都体现出了这种儿童生活的味道。
    南京的剪纸其外在的特点，都是短粗粗、圆都都、胖胡胡、笨拙拙的，我们细细欣赏王明长的“双鱼龙门”、武老太的“秋虫芙蓉芦”、张吉根的“莲生贵子”，都具有民间艺术那种朴实、淳厚、优美的趣味和上述的特点。
    像张吉根、王明长、武老太这样的剪纸艺人，他们从来都是以剪纸为业，世代相传。武老太从小姑娘时代就开始学习剪纸，到现在已剪了五十多年；王明长在幼年是跟他祖父和父亲学习的；张吉根的老师是他的外婆和舅父。由于经过长年累月的实际锻炼，都掌握了熟练的技巧。他们不用墨笔抅稿，都能剪得很准，达到了得心应手的程度。他们剪的喜花，在国内外都得到好评。他们都以剪纸为业，对自己的职业有着浓厚的兴趣。张吉根剪了二十多年，剪的数量虽不少，但自己认为满意的不过几十种，一件好的剪纸，是一件创作，需要经过多次的揣摩推敲，如“童子抱鱼”这件小小的剪纸，曾经反复修改过二十多次，最后才感觉到满意。他说剪好一件看来好玩而有趣味的剪纸，的确要费不少心思。
    剪纸的主要用途：一是用作绣花图稿，称为“花样”，有鞋花、帽花、枕头花等；一是“喜花”，作为婚嫁喜庆之用。结合着某种用途，剪纸的内容多以象征的方法，取谐音隐喻来表现吉祥喜庆等意思。如“福（蝙蝠）寿（蟠桃）双全（双古钱）”、“吉（百结）庆（磬）有余（鱼）”、“双双对对（两对鸳鸯）”等等，表现人民追求美好幸福生活的愿望。
    剪纸的基本训练，分“圆”“尖”“缺”三个方面。“圆”是指花的大体形态，“尖”与“缺”是指花尖和花瓣之间匀称的距离。这基本形状，都要经过反复的练习，要表现自如，掌握的很准。不论剪人物、动物或者花鸟，都是从下到上、从左到右剪起（这是为了顺手），若是一个较复杂的构图，不论其外形是方的或是圆的，都是从里向外剪。这些都是基本方法。
    为了继承和发扬南京的剪纸艺术，在南京市的文化领导部门指导之下，艺人们已于1955年组织了民间剪刻纸工艺生产合作社（现属手工业部门领导），现有社员十七人，张吉根、王明长、武老太，都参加了合作社，张吉根作了合作社的主任。为了提高剪纸的艺术质量，他们要求文化部门和美术界的同志多给以帮助和关心。（附图片）
