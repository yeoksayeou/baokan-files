(Tianjin Daily News) The director of the nationally renowned "Poor Stick Cooperative" – Wang Guofan, of the Jianming Agriculture, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Zunhua County, Hebei – answered questions from a reporter on the 7th in Tianjin regarding the issue of middle and primary school graduates participating in labor in the countryside.

    Q: Some middle and primary school graduates think that the countryside is hard and are unwilling to go. Is this idea correct?

    A: At present, rural life cannot be the same as urban life. However, the truly hard days in the countryside are over. Take the people of our "Poor Stick Cooperative" as an example. Life before liberation was even more bitter than gall. Many people relied on begging for a living year-round. In 1936, even without natural disasters or human-made calamities, twenty-seven people starved to death. After liberation, people were given land, and their lives improved somewhat. But they still couldn't withstand the wind and rain, and they would fall and not be able to get back up when they encountered natural disasters. Before 1952, the state had to provide us with at least 50,000 catties of grain and hundreds of sets of winter clothing every year. Only since embarking on the road of collectivization has the state of poverty been completely changed; production has increased year by year, and life has improved year after year. In the past, even in good years, a mu of land would only yield a few dozen catties of grain, but now each mu yields an average of 440 catties of grain. Last autumn harvest, each labor day was allocated sixteen catties of grain and eight jiao of cash; each person also received one catty of cotton and twenty-two catties of peanuts. The average income per household was 536.9 yuan. Although the amount of money is not very much, rural expenses are low, so it is enough to spend. The lives of the cooperative members have generally risen to the level of middle peasants. Zhang Cun, a graduate of senior primary school, once thought that doing anything was better than farming and was unwilling to stay in the countryside. Also, a girl named Wang Yulan felt the same as Zhang Cun, fearing the hardship of the countryside, and after graduating from senior primary school, she was determined to go to the city. After repeated education and mobilization by the township party branch and cooperative leaders, they both agreed to participate in labor in the cooperative and contribute to the construction of the new countryside. Last year, Wang Yulan earned 1,800 work points, with an income of more than 300 yuan; Zhang Cun earned 2,200 points, with an income of more than 500 yuan. Zhang Cun's family had lived in three dilapidated thatched houses for several generations. This year, they built six flat-roofed tile houses, and the family is living very happily. In short, the countryside, which has embarked on the bright road of collectivization, is full of hope. In another five or ten years, our place will be illuminated by electric lights, making it difficult to distinguish day and night, with tens of thousands of mu of fertile land, thousands of mu of pasture, a sea of green; cattle and sheep all over the mountains, chickens and ducks in flocks; fruit trees providing shade on the mountains, and roads and canals crisscrossing below the mountains, reaching out in all directions. How wonderful life will be! Although rural life is not as good as urban life right now, what does it matter to endure a little hardship for a better future?

    Q: Rural living conditions have improved, but do students face any difficulties in the countryside?

    A: Life cannot be as smooth as water stored in a pond; there will always be some twists and turns, some difficulties. The fifty-five high school, junior high school, and primary school graduates who have come to our cooperative have all encountered difficulties, big and small, in the countryside. The girl Wang Yulan mentioned earlier couldn't carry anything on her shoulders or lift anything with her hands when she first went to the fields; when she tried to plow the land, the livestock would stand still and refuse to move, making the girl cry. The older generation hurried to help her. I said: Girl, since you are determined to take off your shoes and go into the fields, there is nothing difficult in the fields. As long as you are willing to learn and practice, I guarantee you will become a good farmer. She listened obediently, wiped away her tears, and went to hold the plow. She worked from the fifth watch [before dawn] until late at night every day, learning from the older generation of farmers. Soon, she could handle anything, from drilling, sowing, tending fruit trees, to raising livestock. People elected her as the production team leader. There was also a high school graduate in the cooperative named Zhang Lihua. The cooperative once sent him to an agricultural technology training class to train him as an agricultural technician. Initially, when he promoted new cultivation techniques in the cooperative, many people opposed him and made strange remarks. His father angrily scolded him, saying: Don't come to my land to give instructions. We don't need you to teach us how to farm! When the cooperative didn't have enough fertilizer and wanted to promote the "smoking soil to accumulate fertilizer" method of a brother cooperative, many people objected to Zhang Lihua, saying: "Every piece of land has its own temple. Young man, don't mess around"; when the cooperative wanted to promote "close planting," many people argued with Zhang Lihua, saying, "Our ancestors have always emphasized 'corn rows with room for oxen to pass.' The sparser the planting, the better. What are you doing?" This made the young man so angry that he came to the director, asking to be transferred, thinking that the countryside was not a place for knowledgeable youth to stay. We explained the reasons to him, telling him that peasants had been oppressed for thousands of years, lacked cultural knowledge, and were slow to accept new things. At the same time, party members and cadres also helped him go to the fields to do publicity and mobilization work, set up demonstration models, and so on. They used facts to educate the cooperative members to recognize the benefits of adopting new technologies. This opened the way for Zhang Lihua's work, and now everyone trusts him very much. Dai Kuan, a 56-year-old farmer, initially firmly opposed close planting and argued with Zhang Lihua. Later, close planting increased his harvest, and he went to Zhang Lihua, apologized to the young man, and now repeatedly says that he believes in science and praises Zhang Lihua for contributing to improving production technology.

  Q: Does the countryside urgently need knowledgeable youth?

    A: It needs them very much. When our "Poor Stick Cooperative" started from scratch, we faced many difficulties. We had no vehicles, no farm implements, no livestock, and no seeds. But these difficulties were relatively easy to overcome. Under the leadership of the party, everyone relied on their own hands, going up the mountains to chop firewood and down to the lowlands to cut grass, saving every penny, and slowly buying vehicles, acquiring farm implements, and accumulating bit by bit. Only the lack of culture was difficult to overcome. In the early days of our cooperative, none of the dozens of people were literate, let alone able to write. At that time, there were no financial accounts at all. Everyone did things based on their conscience. Later, when more people joined the cooperative, there were a few people who had attended private schools for two seasons during the Guangxu era, and the cooperative asked them to be accountants. They struggled even to keep a "tofu account" [a poorly kept account]. It wasn't until the first batch of senior primary school graduates joined the production team three years ago that several accountants were added, and new bookkeeping accounts were used. It took a lot of effort to reorganize the old accounts when changing the books because the "tofu account" was too difficult to understand. Furthermore, the reason why our cooperative has been able to increase production in recent years is also due to the absorption of educated people to participate in the work, using scientific methods to improve soil, improve technical management, build water conservancy projects, bring water to the mountains, and promote and implement various production-increasing measures. We used to raise native Hebei sheep in our cooperative. The wool quality of this type of sheep was low. The state transported Indian sheep breeds to us to help us improve the breed of sheep. However, Hebei native sheep and Indian sheep were unwilling to mate, and artificial insemination was required. This matter stumped the "roughnecks," fortunately there was technician Zhang Lihua. The cooperative sent him to the county veterinary station to learn and bring back a set of science for improving livestock breeds. There were more than sixty kinds of tools for artificial insemination alone, and mating also required the application of biological genetics.... It would have been too difficult for us to learn. Zhang Lihua learned quite well and carefully taught everyone after returning. Now, a batch of sheep have been artificially mated and are pregnant and will give birth to new breeding sheep in the autumn. It is expected that by next year, our cooperative will have some high-quality wool to supply the textile industry. Native sheep wool is only worth a little over one yuan and forty jiao per catty, while the price of new sheep wool is much higher, which is also very beneficial to the cooperative. There are many ways to increase agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production, but all require cultural and scientific knowledge. Therefore, to improve rural productivity, it is necessary to require knowledgeable youth to go to the countryside. Our cooperative very much welcomes middle and primary school graduates to participate in production. We have made preliminary plans and are ready to welcome everyone.

    Q: Is there a future in participating in agricultural production?

    A: Is there a future in participating in agricultural production? Is it honorable? It should be measured by whether it is beneficial to the country and the people, and whether it makes a contribution. Our "Poor Stick Cooperative" listens to the party, resolutely takes the socialist road, uses labor to create wealth, and supports the city and national construction. Last year, we handed over a total of 190,000 catties of public grain and surplus grain sold to the state, and we also picked more than 117,000 catties of fruit to supply the city. We also sold 40,000 catties of the famous Zunhua chestnuts in Tianjin to the state, as well as peanuts, cotton, and so on. We completed the production level stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program to be achieved within twelve years ahead of schedule. We plan to strive to produce 800 catties of grain per mu by 1962. Because we have done something beneficial to the country and the people, the country and the people have given us great honor. On behalf of our cooperative members, I have met Chairman Mao twice in Beijing - a peasant from a poor mountain village met the great leader in Beijing - this is such an unusual thing! The deeds of our cooperative have been recorded in many newspapers across the country, and even in important documents on the socialist upsurge in our country's rural areas; the awards flags given to us by the state and the people are hung all over our office. From last autumn to now, we have received more than three hundred letters of praise and encouragement from volunteer soldiers, workers, peasants, students, and international friends. These letters come from distant Moscow, Albania, and some from Yunnan, Guangdong.... In the collective honor, individuals have also gained great honor. Take the more than fifty middle and primary school graduates who are already in the cooperative as an example, those who labor well have been elected by the cooperative members as cooperative cadres, such as management committee members, team leaders, and so on. Zhang Cun, who works as an accountant while producing, was elected as a youth activist in Hebei Province to build socialism this year. So as long as people work well, they will be honored and have a future. In the new society, every profession produces "top scholars," and agriculture has produced many "top scholars," and more "top scholars" will emerge in the future. (Attached picture)

    知识青年在农村大有可为
    全国闻名的建明农业社主任答天津日报记者问
    本报讯　据天津日报消息：全国闻名的“穷棒子社”——河北遵化县建明农林牧生产合作社主任王国藩，7日在天津回答了记者提出的有关中、小学毕业生到农村参加劳动的问题。
    问：现在有些中、小毕业生，认为农村苦，不愿意去。这种想法对不对？
    答：眼下农村生活和城市生活还不能一样。不过农村真正的苦日子却已经熬过去了。拿我们这个“穷棒子社”的人们来说吧，解放前的生活真比黄连还要苦十分。许多人常年靠要饭生活，1936年，虽然没有天灾人祸，也饿死了二十七人。解放后人们分了土地，生活改善了一些。但还是经不起风吹雨打，遇到天灾人们就跌倒了爬不起来。在1952年以前，国家每年至少要给我们发放五万斤粮食和上百套的寒衣。自从走上合作化的道路以后，贫穷的状况才有了彻底改变；生产一年比一年高，生活也一年好似一年。过去遇到好年景，一亩地也只收几十斤粮食，现在每亩地平均收四百四十斤粮食。去年秋收分配每个劳动日分了十六斤粮食，八角钱现金；每人还分了一斤棉花，二十二斤花生。每户平均收入五百三十六元九角，钱数虽不太多，但农村花销少，也就足够花用了，社员们生活普遍上升到中农水平。高小毕业生张存曾经认为：干什么都比做庄稼强，不愿意在农村里呆；还有个闺女王玉兰也和张存一样，怕农村苦，高小毕业以后就一心想往城市里奔。经过乡里的党支部、合作社领导方面再三的教育动员，他们两个答应到社里参加劳动，为建设新农村出份力量。去年王玉兰挣了一千八百个工分，收入三百多块钱；张存挣了二千二百分，收入五百多块钱。张存家里好几辈子就住着三间破草房，今年他们家盖起了六间平瓦房，一家子生活得挺乐合。——总之，走上了合作化光明大道的农村，一切都充满了希望。再过五年十年，我们这里也就是电灯照耀，昼夜难分，万亩良田，千亩牧场，一片青葱；满山牛羊，鸡鸭成群；山上果树成荫，山下道路水渠纵横，四通八达。——生活将会多么美好呀！眼下农村生活虽不如城市，但是为了美好的将来，吃点苦耐点劳又算得了什么？
    问：农村生活状况已有了改善，但是，学生在农村里有没有什么困难？
    答：生活不能像蓄在池塘里的水那样平平稳稳，总是要有些波折、困难的。先后来到我们社里的五十五个高中、初中、小学毕业生，他们在农村里都遇到过大大小小的困难。前边提到的那个闺女王玉兰，刚下地的时候，肩不能挑手不能提；扶犁下地的时候，牲口呆在地里不动弹，把个闺女急得直哭。我们老一辈的人赶忙就去帮助她。我说：闺女，你既有决心脱鞋下地，地里没啥难事，只要你肯学、肯练，保管你会成为一把种庄稼的好手。她挺听话，抹干眼泪就去扶犁。她每天起五更歇半夜地干活，向老辈的农民学习。不久，耧地、撒种、服侍果木树、饲养牲口，她样样都拿得起来了。人们推选她当了生产队长。社里还有一个高中毕业生叫张丽华，社里曾经送他上了农业技术学习班，培养他当农业技术员。他最初在社里推行新的耕作技术，好多人反对，讲怪话，他父亲也气冲冲地骂他说：你别上我的地里去指点，我们种地用不着你来教！社里肥料不够，要推广兄弟社“熏土积肥”的办法，张丽华去推广时，许多人就跟他提意见说：“一处土地一处庙，你小伙子别瞎折腾”；社里要推行“密植”，又有许多人跟张丽华吵，说“我们祖祖辈辈种地讲究的是‘玉蜀黍行里放水牛’，植得越稀松越好，你胡闹些啥？”把小伙子气得心里直冒火，跑来找主任，要求调工作，认为农村不是知识青年呆的。我们就把道理讲给他听，告诉他农民受了几千年压迫，没有文化知识，接受新东西慢。同时党员们、干部们也帮助他下地做宣传动员工作，搞典型试范等等。用事实教育社员认识了采用新技术的好处。这样给张丽华的工作打开了路，现在大伙儿都非常相信他。五十六岁的老农民戴宽，先是坚决反对密植跟张丽华闹别扭，后来密植使他增加了收获，他找到张丽华，跟小伙子道歉，如今口口声声说自己相信科学，夸奖张丽华对改进生产技术有功劳。
  问：农村是不是迫切需要知识青年？
    答：太需要了。以我们“穷棒子社”当年白手成家的时候来说，困难很多，没有车辆，没有农具，没有牲口，也没有种子。但是这些困难还比较容易克服，在党的领导下，大家凭着一双手，上山砍柴，下洼割草，省吃俭用，慢慢地买车、置农具，一星一点地积累起来。只有没有文化的困难却难以克服。我们社在建社初期，几十号人没有识字的，更不用说写字了。那时财务账目根本没有，大家凭心办事。后来入社的人多了，才有了这么几个光绪年间上过两季私塾的人，社里就请他们当会计。他们记个“豆腐账”还费了老大劲。直到大前年，社里吸收了第一批高小毕业生参加生产，这才补充了几个会计，改用了新式簿记账；在改账的时候，整旧账可费了九牛二虎之力，因为那个“豆腐账”太难看懂了。再说，这几年我们社所以能够增加生产，也跟吸收了有文化的人参加工作，用科学方法改良土壤、改进技术管理，兴修水利，引水上山，推行和实现各种增产措施有很大关系。我们社里原来养河北土种羊，这种羊的毛质量低，国家给我们运来印度羊种，帮助我们改良羊的品种。但是河北土羊与印度羊不肯交配，需要用人工授精，这件事难坏了“大老粗”，幸亏有技术员张丽华。社里派他到县里兽医站去学习，带回了一套改良牲畜品种的科学；单是人工授精的工具就有六十多种，配种还要应用生物遗传学……。如果让我们去学，困难实在太大了。张丽华学得还不错，回来后又细细地给大家传授。现在已经有一批羊经人工交配怀了胎，秋后就可以生出新种羊来。预计到明后年，我们社就可以有一些上等好羊毛供应毛纺织工业生产了。土种羊毛一斤只值一块四角多钱，新种羊毛的价钱要高好些倍，对于社里也有很大好处。增加农、林、牧生产，有许多办法，但都要有文化科学知识才行。所以要提高农村生产力就要要求知识青年下农村。我们社十分欢迎中、小学毕业生去参加生产，我们已初步做了计划，准备迎接大家。
    问：参加农业生产有没有出息？
    答：参加农业生产是不是有出息？是不是光荣？应该用对国家、对人民有没有益处，有没有贡献的尺子来衡量。我们这个“穷棒子社”听党的话，坚决走社会主义的路，用劳动创造财富，支援城市，支援国家建设。去年一年我们交给国家的公粮和卖给国家的余粮共有十九万斤，还摘了十一万七千多斤水果供给城市，在天津著名的遵化栗子，我们也卖给了国家四万斤，另外还有花生、棉花等等。我们提前完成了全国农业发展纲要所规定的在十二年内达到的产量水平。计划到1962年，每亩地要争取生产八百斤粮食。因为我们做了一点对国家人民有益的事，国家人民给我们很大的光荣，我代表我们社员两次到北京见毛主席——一个穷山沟里的农民到北京见伟大的领袖——这是多么不平常的事情哩！在全国的许多报纸上，以至关于我国农村的社会主义高潮的重要文件上，都记录了我们社的事迹；国家和人民给我们的奖旗挂满了我们的办公室，去年秋天到现在，我们收到志愿军战士、工人、农民、学生、国际友人表扬鼓励我们的来信，就有三百多封，这些信有的来自遥远的莫斯科、阿尔巴尼亚，有的来自云南、广东……。在集体的荣誉里，个人也得到了很大的光荣，拿已经在社里的五十多个中、小学毕业生说，他们劳动得好的都被社员们选为社干部，如管理委员、队长等等。一边生产一边当会计的张存，今年被选为河北省建设社会主义的青年积极分子。所以人们只要劳动得好，就会得到光荣，就有出息。新社会行行出“状元”，农业出了不少“状元”，将来还会出更多的“状元”的。（附图片）
