    Message Carried by the Wind
    A nine-year-old boy from New York, Ganai Kapolen, used a method of communication that no one in the world had ever used before to send two letters, and both received replies. Kapolen lived in a five-story apartment building on Park Avenue. On April 24th of last year, he wrote two letters, put them in envelopes addressed "To the Gentleman," and then let the two letters float out the window. When he had already forgotten about this matter, he received replies, one from Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and the other from the even more distant Rangoon, the capital of Burma. The reply from Rangoon said, "Just as I was sitting under the pine tree in front of my house, your letter fell in front of me on the initial seasonal wind of this year." (Yan)

    随风传书
    一个九岁的纽约孩子嘉内·卡泼伦，他用了世界上谁也没有使用过的通信方法发出了两封信，而且都来了回信。卡泼伦住在公园林荫道旁一座五层楼的公寓中，去年4月24日写了两封信，放进了署名“给那位先生”的信封中，然后让这两封信从窗口飘了出去。当他已将此事忘却的时候，却接到了回信，一封是来自俄克拉何马州福脱歇尔地方，另一封来自更远的缅甸首都仰光。寄自仰光的那封复信说：“当我刚坐在家门口的松树下面的时候，你的信却乘了今年最初的季节风，掉落在我的面前”。（岩）
