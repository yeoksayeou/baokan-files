Rural Private Middle Schools in Shandong Can Enroll Nearly Ten Thousand Students
Private Schools in Sichuan Develop Rapidly; Teaching Quality Significantly Improves

(By our newspaper) The masses in the vast rural areas of Shandong Province have recently shown great enthusiasm for establishing private middle schools. According to preliminary statistics from the Shandong Provincial People's Committee, twenty-nine private middle schools have already been established or are being prepared for establishment in ten counties, including Yanggu, Laiyang, Yexian, Zhangqiu, Xin, Qihe, Licheng, Yidu, Yuncheng, and Shouguang, enrolling a total of more than 2,550 students. In addition, 145 private spare-time middle school classes have been established, which can also enroll more than 7,250 graduates of senior primary schools. Furthermore, Xin County plans to establish four cultural tutoring classes for senior primary school graduates. These private schools were all established on a voluntary basis by the masses, who raised funds, built school buildings, and hired teachers themselves, without government subsidies. The county education bureau leads the teaching affairs, and can help hire teachers when necessary.

(By our newspaper) Currently, public schools in various parts of Sichuan Province have completed enrollment, and the people in many areas are actively raising funds and starting to build new private schools or expand existing school buildings, preparing to expand enrollment to meet the needs of some school-age children and students who failed to be admitted to continue their studies. Recently, Junlian County has established a total of 47 private primary schools in three districts, nine directly affiliated townships, and more than 400 agricultural cooperatives, enrolling more than 1,000 students. These schools were all built by the masses, and daily expenses are subsidized by the agricultural cooperatives. In order to further promote the enthusiasm of the masses for running schools for a long time, Leshan City also reorganized the private school affairs management committees of the districts into street private school trustee boards in July, and selected a group of enthusiastic social figures and people's representatives as trustees to be responsible for fundraising, expenditure, and hiring teachers for private schools in various streets. Now, the board of trustees of private schools in various streets are mobilizing residents to plan to expand school buildings and prepare for enrollment.

In recent years, the number of private schools in various places has increased rapidly, and the level of teachers and teaching content have also been significantly improved. In 1953, there were only 17 private school classes in Leshan City, with 900 students. Now, it has developed into three private primary schools and twelve private kindergartens, with a total of 64 classes and more than 2,800 students. The courses in each school are the same as those in public schools, and teaching is conducted in accordance with the teaching syllabus issued by the government.

Many private school teachers have demonstrated initiative and creativity in their work and have made achievements. The teachers of Sanyuan Township Private Primary School, Jianguo Private Primary School, and Dalin Private Primary School in Jianyang County, because they have clarified the school-running policy of private schools, generally attach great importance to cultivating students' knowledge and skills of labor production, and organize students to plant various crops, accumulate green manure, collect sheep manure, raise fish, and raise various small animals in their spare time. The potatoes, cotton, and pumpkins planted by the teachers and students of Sanyuan Township Private Primary School, the 2,000 carp and more than 100 sheep, rabbits, chickens, ducks, and other animals raised, plus the fertilizer accumulated in one year, can generate more than 980 yuan in income. In addition to paying teachers' salaries and purchasing teaching equipment, this income can also provide more than 400 yuan in subsidies for the tuition and food expenses of poor students.

　　山东农村民办中学可招生近万名
　　四川民办学校迅速发展　教学质量显著提高
    本报讯　山东省广大农村中，最近群众筹建民办中学的积极性很高。据山东省人民委员会的初步统计，阳谷、莱阳、掖县、章丘、莘县、齐河、历城、益都、郓城、寿光等十个县已经成立或准备成立的民办中学，就有二十九处，共招收学生二千五百五十余人；成立民办业余中学一百四十五班，也能招收高小毕业生七千二百五十余人。此外，莘县还拟成立高小毕业生文化补习班四个班。这些民办学校全是在群众自愿的基础上，由群众自筹经费、校舍和自请教师成立的，不要政府补助。在教学业务上，由县教育局领导，必要时可帮助聘请教师。

    本报讯　目前，四川省各地公立学校已招生完毕，许多地区的人民群众正积极筹集资金，着手新建一批民办学校或扩充原有校舍，准备扩大招生，以满足部分学龄儿童和落榜学生继续学习的要求。筠连县最近已在三个区、九个直属乡、四百多个农业社中，共举办了民办小学四十七所，招收了一千多名学生。这些学校全都是群众出力修建的，日常经费则由各农业社给予适当补助。乐山城区为进一步发挥群众长期办学的积极性，也在7月间将区的民办学校校务管理委员会一律改组为街道民办学校校董会，选出一批热心办学的社会人士和人民代表为校董，负责各街道民办学校经费的筹集、开支和聘用教师等事宜。现在，各街道民办学校董事会正发动居民群众，筹划扩充校舍，准备招生。
    几年来，各地民办学校的数量增加很快，师资水平和教学内容也有了显著的提高和改善。乐山城区在1953年只有民办学校十七班，学生九百人，现在发展到民办小学三所，民办幼儿园十二所，共六十四班，学生达二千八百多人。各校课程和公立学校一样，按照政府颁发的教学大纲进行教学。
    许多民办学校教师在工作中都发挥了积极性和创造性，作出了成绩。简阳县三元乡民办小学、建国民办小学和大林民办小学的教师们，由于明确了民办学校的办学方针，一般的都很重视培养学生掌握劳动生产的知识技能，组织学生在课余时间种植各种农作物，积青肥，拾羊粪，养鱼和饲养各种小动物。仅三元乡民办小学师生种植的洋芋、棉花、南瓜，喂养的二千尾鲤鱼和一百多只羊、兔、鸡、鸭等动物，加上一年积的肥料，就可收入九百八十多元。这笔收入除支付教师工资和添置教学设备外，还可剩余四百多元补助贫苦学生的学费和伙食费。
