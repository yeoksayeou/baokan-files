Reader's Letter:

　　Mothers' Anger and Protest

　　Editor's Note: Since this newspaper published the newsletter "They Must Return the Sons to Them!" on August 20th, we have received fifty-six letters from readers in the past few days, many of which were co-signed by several readers. Many of the readers who wrote are mothers. In their letters, readers unanimously expressed their deep sympathy and condolences to the Kuzmin couple, Soviet citizens persecuted by the American government. At the same time, they expressed their great indignation and protest against the American government's inhuman act of forcibly seizing the Kuzmin couple's four sons. We are now publishing four selected letters as follows:

Editor:

　　After reading "They Must Return the Sons to Them," we felt extremely angry. The faces of four innocent, naive, and lovely children seem to be crying to us. The wolf-hearted American imperialists deprived them of their rights as sons, forcibly snatching them away from their parents' arms. This is American "humanitarianism." This is the American "democracy" and "freedom" that the rightists are so keen to yearn for!

　　What kind of reasoning is this?! What kind of law is this?! As mothers, we cannot help but shout to peace-loving people all over the world: "Save the children!"

　　We call on everyone to unite and fight against this barbaric act of illegally violating human rights.

Editor:

　　After seeing the newsletter "They Must Return the Sons to Them!" in your newspaper, I felt infinite sympathy for the Kuzmin couple and extreme hatred for American imperialism!

　　I am a mother of three children and know how to love my children. When I saw the photos of Rostislav, Yura, Pavel, and little Bega, I felt how lovely they were! I can fully understand Comrade Kuzmina's feelings after losing them. The American government not only subjected the Kuzmin couple to personal persecution, but also wanted these innocent children to forget their parents, forget their own language and country. How cruel and vicious this is! This is an unforgivable crime!

　　Before I finished reading this newsletter, tears were already streaming down my face, and at the same time, flames of anger were burning in my chest. I want to accuse, to call on mothers all over the world to unite and protest against the evil, man-eating American imperialism! We must make these four lovely children return to their parents' side and return to the embrace of their motherland!

Editor:

　　After reading the article "They Must Return the Sons to Them!" in your newspaper on August 20th, we felt great indignation. We are indignant that Soviet citizens like the Kuzmin couple, who lived in the United States, were innocently confined to mental hospitals for several years and had their children taken away, even a ten-month-old baby was taken away, just because they wanted to return to their own country. We are also angry because we also thought of some rightists in society in recent months who, taking advantage of the opportunity to help the Party rectify its work style, attacked our country's democratic system and flaunted and promoted the so-called "democracy and freedom" of capitalist countries. So now, please let those rightist gentlemen take a look! Is dismantling other people's families, taking away their loved ones, and depriving expatriates of their right to return to their own country, is this "true" democracy and freedom? We believe that this incident is a powerful answer to those rightists who slander the socialist democratic system and promote bourgeois democracy.

　　Qingdao City Parents of Two Children
　　　　　　　　Tan Lina, Zhou Yanqin

Editor:

　　I am twenty-two years old this year and the mother of two children. When I saw the People's Daily's newsletter "They Must Return the Sons to Them!", I was extremely angry. I firmly support the Kuzmin couple's just demands. Their own sons must return to their parents' arms and return to the embrace of their motherland!

　　My son is two years old, and my daughter was born three months later than little Bega. They received the care of the government before they were even born. The warm sunshine of our motherland makes them grow up strong, lovely, lively and endearing.

　　However, the inhumane American robbers forcibly seized the Kuzmin couple's beloved son! We can imagine what kind of ravages little Bega and his brothers will suffer, and what kind of trauma their young hearts will suffer. The American robbers' act of forcibly seizing other people's children is absolutely intolerable. I firmly demand that the United States return these four children to their parents.

### 母亲们的愤怒和抗议

专栏：读者来信

　　母亲们的愤怒和抗议
    编者的话：自本报于8月20日刊出“必须把儿子归还他们！”的通讯后，几天来收到读者来信五十六封，其中有许多信是好几位读者联名写的。来信的读者中很多是做了母亲的人。读者们在信中对遭到美国政府迫害的苏联公民库兹敏夫妇，一致表示深刻的同情和慰问。同时对美国政府惨无人道地强夺库兹敏夫妇的四个儿子的行为，表示极大的愤慨和抗议。现将来信选登四封如下：编辑同志：
    我们读了“必须把儿子归还他们”之后，感到万分愤怒。四个无辜、天真、可爱的孩子的面庞，好像在对着我们哭诉。狼心狗肺的美帝国主义者剥夺了他们做儿子的权利，活活地把他们硬从父母的怀抱中劫走。这就是美国的“人道主义”。这就是右派分子所热衷向往的美国的“民主”与“自由”！
    这是什么道理！！这是什么法律！！做为母亲的我们，不能不向全世界爱好和平的人们大声疾呼：“救救孩子们！”
    我们呼吁：大家团结起来，对这种非法侵犯人权的野蛮行为进行斗争。

                  莫德容编辑同志：
    看到你报“必须把儿子归还他们！”的通讯后，使我对库兹敏夫妇感到无限的同情；对美帝国主义感到万分的痛恨！
    我是一个三个孩子的母亲，知道怎样疼爱我的孩子。当我看到罗斯几斯拉夫、尤拉、巴维尔和小别加的照片的时候，我感到他们是多么可爱呀！库兹敏娜同志失去他们后的心情，我是完全可以理解的。美国政府不但对库兹敏夫妇加以人身迫害，而且要使这些天真无辜的孩子，忘掉他们的父母，忘却他们自己的语言和祖国，这是多么残忍和狠毒！这是不可饶恕的罪恶！
    我还没有看完这篇通讯时，泪水就已夺眶而出，同时愤怒的火焰在胸膛里燃烧。我要控诉，要号召全世界的母亲联合起来向万恶的吃人野兽般的美帝国主义抗议！一定要叫这四个可爱的孩子回到他们父母的身边，回到他们祖国的怀抱！
        中国医药公司　柳庆宜编辑同志：
    看了8月20日你报“必须把儿子归还他们！”一文以后，我们感到莫大的愤慨。我们愤慨的是像库兹敏夫妇这样侨居在美国的苏联公民，仅仅为了想回到自己的祖国，竟被美国政府无辜的关进疯人院达数年之久，并被劫去了他们的孩子，甚至最后竟连一个十个月的婴儿都被劫走。我们气愤，还因为我们同时想到了近几月来社会上的一些右派分子，趁帮助党整风之机，攻击我国的民主制度，标榜和宣传资本主义国家的所谓
  “民主和自由”。那么现在就请那些右派老爷们看看吧！难道拆散别人的家庭、夺去人家的亲骨肉、剥夺侨民回到自己祖国的权利，这就是“真正的”民主和自由吗？我们觉得这一事件正是对那些诬蔑社会主义民主制度、宣传资产阶级民主的右派分子的一个有力的回答。
    青岛市两个孩子的父母
          谭丽娜、周延钦编辑同志：
    我今年二十二岁，是两个孩子的母亲。当我看见人民日报的“必须把儿子归还他们！”的通讯后，我愤怒极了，我坚决支持库兹敏夫妇的正义要求，他们亲生的儿子必须回到自己父母的怀抱，回到自己祖国的怀抱！
    我的儿子两岁啦，女儿比小别加晚出生三个月，在他们还没出生的时候就受到了政府的关怀，我们祖国温暖的阳光使他们生长得一个个健壮可爱，活泼逗人。
    但是，惨无人道的美国强盗却强夺了库兹敏夫妇的爱子！我们可以想像到，小别加和他的哥哥们将遭受到怎样的蹂躏，他们的幼小的心灵，将受到怎样的创伤。美国强盗的强夺他人子女的行为是决不能容忍的。我坚决要求美国把这四个孩子还给他们的父母。　　光士瑜
