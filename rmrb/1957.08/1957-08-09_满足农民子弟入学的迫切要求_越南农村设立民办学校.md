Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 8th. The Vietnamese Ministry of Education recently issued a provisional decision on private primary schools to encourage the large-scale development of private schools in rural areas to meet the urgent demand for enrollment of farmers' children.

According to this decision of the Ministry of Education, farmers can apply to establish private schools and classes in rural areas with better material conditions. In areas with poor conditions, private classes can be attached to first-level national public schools (equivalent to primary schools in China).

Private schools, like public schools, are under the leadership of administrative committees and education authorities at all levels, and students and teachers enjoy the same rights and treatment as public schools.

According to sources from the Ministry of Education, these schools jointly run by farmers themselves have been widely established in rural areas. Currently, there are more than 230,000 students in private schools in the entire North, accounting for 27% of the total number of students in first-level public schools in the North.

    满足农民子弟入学的迫切要求
    越南农村设立民办学校
    新华社河内8日电　越南教育部最近发布了关于民办普通小学的暂行决定，以鼓励在农村中大量发展民办学校，来满足农民子弟入学的迫切要求。
    根据教育部这个决定，凡在农村中物质条件较好的地区，农民可以申请建立民办学校和班级。在条件较差的地方，民办的班级可以附设在第一级国立普通学校（相当于中国的小学）中。
    民办学校和公立学校一样，受各级行政委员会和教育机关的领导，学生和教师享受同公立学校同样的权利和待遇。
    据教育部人士说，这种由农民自己联合兴办的学校，在农村中已经普遍建立起来。现在全北方民办学校的学生达二十三万多人，占北方第一级普通学校学生总数的27％。
