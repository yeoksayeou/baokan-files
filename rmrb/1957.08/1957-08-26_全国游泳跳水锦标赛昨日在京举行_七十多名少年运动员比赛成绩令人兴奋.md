The 1957 National Swimming and Diving Championships began yesterday at the Taoranting Swimming Pool in Beijing.

In the men's Group A 100-meter freestyle final, Guangdong athlete Lin Jinzhu broke the national record with a time of 57.4 seconds, winning first place in this event. In addition, the results of the seven finals and ten preliminary rounds in the men's and women's Group A, Group B, and junior groups held yesterday were affected by the drizzling rain and the drop in temperature to 24 degrees Celsius, and no national records were broken. However, in the junior group men's 100-meter backstroke and freestyle preliminary rounds, and the women's 100-meter freestyle preliminary round, the results of the majority of the seventy-plus young athletes reached the standard of a third-level athlete, and a few even reached the standards of second-level and first-level athletes.

The men's Group A 100-meter freestyle final was a tense and fierce competition. In the first ten meters or so, the nine athletes were almost neck and neck. After twenty meters, Lin Jinzhu overtook all the athletes, with only Mu Ruilong from Tianjin closely following behind him. In the final twenty meters, Mu Ruilong strengthened his sprint, attempting to surpass Lin Jinzhu, but Lin Jinzhu also accelerated his sprint at this time, finally taking first place with a time of 57.4 seconds. However, this result was 0.2 seconds slower than the 57.2 seconds he achieved in the 100-meter freestyle preliminary round at the Moscow Youth Friendship Games.

The men's Group B 100-meter sidestroke competition was held yesterday afternoon and was a new event in this competition. No swimming competitions held after liberation have included this event. A total of thirty-three athletes participated in this event.

Yesterday also saw the men's and women's Group A springboard diving competitions, with eleven athletes participating in these two events. (Photos attached)

    全国游泳跳水锦标赛昨日在京举行
    七十多名少年运动员比赛成绩令人兴奋
    本报讯　1957年全国游泳、跳水锦标比赛昨天在北京陶然亭游泳场开始举行。
    广东省运动员林锦珠在男子甲组一百公尺自由泳决赛中，以五十七秒四的成绩打破了全国最高纪录，获得了这个项目的第一名。另外在昨日举行的男女甲组、乙组和少年组的七项决赛和十项预赛中，因细雨蒙蒙，温度降到二十四度，成绩都受到了影响，没有一项打破全国纪录。但是参加少年组男子一百公尺仰泳、自由泳预赛，女子一百公尺自由泳预赛中，七十多名少年运动员的成绩绝大多数达到了三级运动员的标准，少数还达到了二级运动员和一级运动员的标准。
    男子甲组一百公尺自由泳决赛是一场紧张、激烈的比赛。在前十几公尺时，九名运动员几乎是齐头并进，到二十公尺以后，林锦珠便越过了所有的运动员，只有天津市的穆瑞龙始终紧跟在他后面。到最后二十公尺时，穆瑞龙加强了冲刺，企图超过林锦珠，但是林锦珠这时也加快了冲刺，终于以五十七秒四的成绩取得了第一名，但是这个成绩比他在莫斯科青年友谊运动会上一百公尺自由泳预赛中创造的五十七秒二的成绩还要差零点二秒。
    昨天下午举行男子乙组一百公尺侧泳比赛，是这次比赛中的一个新项目，解放后所举行游泳比赛都没有这个项目。参加这个项目比赛的共有运动员三十三名。
    昨日还举行了男、女甲组跳板跳水的比赛，有十一名运动员参加了这两项比赛。（附图片）
