Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, August 19th: Forest surveys for the development of the Bailong River Forest Area have recently been completed. This largest virgin forest in the Northwest, which has been dormant for thousands of years, will be formally exploited next year.

Currently, various basic construction tasks in the logging area are being carried out in full swing. The dormitories, offices, and other buildings of the two logging yards will be completed by the end of December this year. A timber rafting yard being built in the middle reaches of the Bailong River, and a large timber yard located along the Baoji-Chengdu Railway in Zhaohua, Sichuan, capable of storing more than 300,000 cubic meters of timber, have both begun preparations for construction. A 70-kilometer highway from Shawan on the Gansu-Sichuan Highway to the forest area has also begun full-scale construction. From one mountain to another, line workers are carrying thick utility poles to erect a forest area telephone network with a total length of more than 280 li. By the end of September this year, this telephone network will connect the logging yards with every logging section and timber collection yard.

The Bailong River Forest Area is located in southern Gansu Province, bordering Qinghai in the west and Sichuan in the south. It has a forest area of more than 700,000 hectares and contains large reserves of precious timber such as fir, spruce, and oil pine.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, August 19th: (Xinhua News Agency reporter Sun Chuanhao) On the south slope of Mount Taibai in the Qinling Mountains, there is a large area of well-growing virgin forest. In this ancient forest with dense foliage, pagoda-shaped fir trees, twenty meters high, stretch as far as the eye can see. Judging by the tree rings, these trees have mostly grown for two or three hundred years.

In this virgin forest on the west side of Mount Taibai, spanning three mountain ridges and covering an area of several million square meters, there are also a small number of birch trees mixed in; the ground is also covered with alpine herbaceous plants such as bistort and sedum. There are few shrubs in this forest. On the slopes and in the valleys, there are many newly grown fir seedlings.

The Qinling Biogeography Expedition Team of the Chinese Academy of Sciences recently conducted inspections and surveys here.

    建设西北森林工业基地
    白龙江原始森林即将开采
    太白山南坡新发现大片森林
    据新华社兰州19日电　为开发白龙江林区而进行的森林调查工作已经在最近完成。这个沉睡了千百年的西北最大的原始森林，将在明年正式开采。
    目前，采伐林区的各项基本建设工作正在全面展开。两个伐木场的宿舍、办公室等建筑物到今年12月底就可以全部建成。在白龙江中游兴建的一个木材编排场，和设在四川昭化宝成铁路沿线的一个可贮存三十多万立方公尺木材的大贮木场，都已开始筹建。从甘川公路的沙湾通向林区的一条七十多公里的公路也已全面动工。从这座山跨到那座山，架线工人们正在抬着粗大的电线杆，架设总长二百八十多华里的林区电话网。到今年9月底，这个电话网就可以把伐木场同每一个伐区和集木场全部联接起来。
    白龙江林区位于甘肃省南部，西接青海，南接四川，拥有森林面积七十多万公顷，蕴藏着大量的冷杉、云杉、油松等珍贵木材。
    据新华社西安19日电　新华社记者孙传镐报道：在秦岭西太白山南坡，有着一大片生长良好的原始森林。在这片林叶浓密的古老林子里，高一、二十公尺的宝塔形状的冷杉一眼望不到尽头。按树干的年轮计算，这些树大都已生长了两三百年。
    在西太白山这个绵延三个山梁，面积有好几百万平方公尺的原始森林里，还混杂着少部分牛皮桦树；地下并且长有球穗蓼、景天等高山草本植物。这片林子内很少灌木存在。山坡上和沟谷里，有很多新生的冷杉幼苗。
    中国科学院秦岭生物地理考察队最近到这里进行了察看和调查。
