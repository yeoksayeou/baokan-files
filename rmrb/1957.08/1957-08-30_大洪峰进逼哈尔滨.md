　　Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 29th - The great flood peak appearing on the Second Songhua River is approaching the city of Harbin. At 6:00 PM today, the water level of the river in the Harbin area had risen to 119.61 meters, exceeding the warning level by 0.11 meters, only 0.45 meters lower than last year's highest flood peak. The river surface is already two meters higher than the city's ground level, and the water level is still rising.

　　Today, under the assault of a level six wind, 150,000 soldiers and civilians in Harbin City persevered in reinforcing the dikes. A unit of the People's Liberation Army, which arrived in Harbin City at midnight yesterday, went to three critical dikes at noon today to participate in the emergency repairs. Through the selfless labor of the soldiers and civilians, two dike sections where slope failures had occurred have been reinforced and are now out of danger. The city's dike emergency repair teams have been organized, and emergency repair materials have also been transported to the vicinity of the dikes. To prevent the raging waves from pounding the dikes, the city's flood control department has transferred hundreds of forestry workers to deploy three kilometers of wave-breaking log rafts at three critical bay mouths along the river. Some critical dikes are also being covered with an additional layer of straw mats for protection.

　　Today, the Ministry of Water Resources sent two water conservancy experts to strengthen technical guidance. The dike drilling team that came to support from the Yellow River dikes has also arrived at the critical dikes to detect hidden dangers in the dikes.

　  大洪峰进逼哈尔滨
    新华社哈尔滨29日电　第二松花江出现的大洪峰正在向哈尔滨市进逼。今天下午六时，哈尔滨地区江面水位已经上升到一百一十九点六一公尺，超过警戒水位零点一一公尺，比去年最高洪峰水位只低零点四五公尺。江面已经高出市区地面二公尺，而水势仍在继续上涨。
    今天，哈尔滨市在六级大风袭击下，十五万军民坚持不懈地加固堤坝。昨天午夜到达哈尔滨市的人民解放军一部，已经在今天中午开上三处险要大堤参加抢修。经过军民忘我劳动，两处发生脱坡现象的堤段已经加固脱险。全市堤防抢险队已经组织起来，抢险器材也已经运到堤防附近。为了防止怒涛猛击堤坝，市防汛部门已调来几百名森林制材工人，在沿江三处险要湾口布置三公里长的防浪木排。有些险要大堤也在加铺一层草席维护。
    今天，水利部派来两位水利专家，以加强技术指导。从黄河堤防上前来支援的钻堤队，也已到险要大堤上探测堤坝的隐患。
