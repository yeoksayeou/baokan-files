    Shanxi Yuncheng Machinery Factory Workers
    Achieve Simultaneous Victory on Two Fronts
    Rightist Elements Lower Their Heads and Admit Guilt; Production Plan Exceeded

    (Our Newspaper) News report. The workers of the Shanxi Yuncheng Machinery Factory have achieved simultaneous victories on both fronts: the struggle against rightist elements and the increased production and frugality campaign.

    In late May, when workers at this factory put forward various well-intentioned criticisms to help the Party rectify its work, with the aim of improving socialist enterprises, rightist elements such as technician Qin Shiyi took the opportunity to launch a frenzied attack against the Party. In order to achieve his goal of overthrowing the leadership of the Party, Qin Shiyi, on the one hand, clamored that the factory director and deputy director were all "talking nonsense," and that even the Party branch secretary was no good because their technology was not as "advanced" as his, and he presumptuously claimed that he wanted to "swap jobs" with them, emphasizing that the machinery factory should be "radically reorganized," "rebranded," and that "only by uprooting everything from top to bottom can the 'three evils' be eliminated," and so on. On the other hand, he incited those who were not content with their work to be passive and go slow, confront the leadership, and insult those honest workers who tried to dissuade him from talking nonsense, calling them "ass-lickers."

    Honest workers quickly began to counterattack the rightist elements. When veteran worker Li Wendou first heard "opinions" such as "radical reorganization" and "uprooting everything," he angrily said: "Is this called giving opinions? It's simply trying to rebel! I'm not a Party member, but I firmly oppose this kind of 'opinion.'" The number of workers automatically writing big-character posters exposing the evil activities of rightist elements increased day by day.

    At this time, because righteousness rose and overcame evil, some people who had once been won over by Qin Shiyi, such as Yang Qixiang, also provided a lot of material, and the rightist elements were finally isolated and bowed their heads in guilt under the stern criticism of the people.

    Through this anti-rightist struggle, many workers realized what the consequences would be if individualism were not overcome. As a result, there was a marked decrease in the number of people making a fuss about treatment, seeking enjoyment, and being dissatisfied with their work. Previously, the dozen or so technicians in the factory did not speak to each other when they met, and looked down on each other. Leading comrades had tried to persuade them to strengthen their unity, but to no avail. This situation dragged on for a whole year, and it was only in the struggle against the rightist elements that everyone truly felt the importance of unity. Now, they have begun to consult with each other when doing things. The enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers has doubled. They said: "The rightist elements said that our Party cannot lead technology. We will use facts to tell them: Only under the leadership of the Party can our production have greater development, and our enterprises can be run better." In June, the workers broke quotas one after another. The factory's main product, pliers, had a monthly planned production of 2,000 units, but actually completed 2,213 units. The factory completed 106.14% of its plan in June, greatly exceeding the previous month. From July 1st to 20th, the production plan for the first and middle ten days of the month had already been exceeded. This is their more powerful counterattack against the rightist elements.

### 山西运城机械厂职工  在两条战线上同时得到胜利  右派分子低头认罪　生产计划超额完成

    山西运城机械厂职工
    在两条战线上同时得到胜利
    右派分子低头认罪　生产计划超额完成
    本报讯　山西运城机械厂职工在反击右派分子和增产节约运动这两条战线上同时取得了胜利。
    5月下旬，当这个工厂的工人为了把社会主义企业办得更好，提出各种善意的批评来帮助党整风的时候，技术员秦式义等右派分子却趁机向党进行了疯狂的攻击。秦式义为了达到推翻党的领导的目的，一方面叫嚣说，正副厂长全“扯蛋”，党支部书记也不行，他们的技术都不如他“高明”，并妄称要跟他们“调换工作”，强调机械厂应该“大改组”，“换牌子”，“只有从上到下连根拔，才能除掉‘三害’”等等；一面又怂恿不安心工作的人消极怠工，同领导对抗，辱骂那些劝阻他胡说乱道的正直职工是“舐屁股”。
    正直的工人迅速开始对右派分子加以反击。老工人李文斗一开始听到“大改组”，“连根拔”这类“意见”的时候，就气愤地说：“这叫做提意见？简直要造反了。我不是党员，但我坚决反对这种‘意见’。”工人自动写大字报揭发右派分子的罪恶活动的事日益增多了。
    这时候由于正气上升，压倒了邪气，一些曾经被秦式义笼络的人，如杨启祥等也提供了许多材料，右派分子这才最后陷于孤立，并在人们的严正批判下低头认罪。
    许多工人通过这次反右派斗争，认识到个人主义思想如果不克服，将得到什么结果。因此，闹待遇，图享受，不安心工作的人都显著地减少了。从前，厂里的十几名技术人员，互相见了面不说话，彼此瞧不起，领导同志曾劝说他们加强团结，但无济于事。这种情形整整拖了一年，只在反右派分子的斗争中，大家才真正感到团结的重要。现在他们办事开始有了商量的空气。广大工人群众的劲头倍增，他们说：“右派分子说我们的党领导不了技术，我们要用事实告诉他们：只有在党的领导下，我们的生产才会有更大的发展，我们的企业才能办得更好。”在6月份，工人们纷纷突破定额，厂里的主要产品老虎钳月计划生产二千台，实际完成二千二百一十三台。全厂6月份完成计划106.14％，比上个月大大超过，7月1日到20日又已超额完成了上中旬的生产计划。这是他们对右派分子的更有力的回击。
