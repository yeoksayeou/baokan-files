    Gannan Guerrilla Verses
    Chen Yi
    (This poem was written in the summer of 1936)

    Dawn is breaking, the team members wake up early.
  Dew soaks clothes and bedding, still cold in summer,
  Cicadas chirp incessantly among the trees.
  Body covered in wild grass.

    Approaching noon, stomach rumbles like a drum.
  Food blockade has lasted three months,
  The rice left in the bag can be counted.
  Wild vegetables boiled with water.

    Sunset in the west, meeting to discuss military strategy.
  No news of communications since morning,
  Counting on return has missed the deadline.
  Move immediately.

    Night is difficult, incessant rain for weeks.
  Camping in the wild, already without tents,
  Large trees shelter us, awaiting daylight.
  Sleepless many times.

    The sky clears, setting up camp under the moon.
  Gentle breeze brings sleepiness,
  Ten thousand pines rustle like gathered clouds.
  Thinking of the enemy's situation in dreams.

    Don't joke around, please lower your voice.
  Inevitably there are enemy scouts outside the forest,
  A cough ahead betrays the plan.
  Correction requires an empty heart.

    Sighing for lack of food, not tasting meat for three months.
  Eating waxberries in summer, peeling bamboo shoots in winter,
  Hunting wild boars, busy all over the mountains.
  Catching snakes late into the night.

    Searching all over the mountains, vegetation withering.
  The enemy's slaughter unprecedented in history,
  The people's resistance is even higher.
  Please hand over the soldiers again.

    Discussing tactics, sitting steadily on the fishing platform.
  Don't fight when the enemy seeks me,
  Attack where they are unprepared.
  Obediently listen to arrangements.

    Relying on the people, never forgetting their support.
  They are our reborn parents,
  I am a good son in the struggle.
  The revolution is strong, the strongest of all.

    Study diligently, lagging behind is truly sad.
  Prepare yourself well today,
  Return with glory from the battlefield in the future.
  Advance with unwavering heart.

    Don't complain, steadily spend the year.
  The powerful enemy questions the tripods in the northern kingdom,
  The great army goes west to cross the Jinsha River.
  The Anti-Japanese War will blossom.

    赣南游击词
    陈毅
    （此词作于1936年夏）天将晓，队员醒来早。露侵衣被夏犹寒，
  树间唧唧啼知了。满身沾野草。天将午，饥肠响如鼓。粮食封锁已三月，
  囊中存米清可数。野菜和水煮。日落西，集会议兵机。交通晨出无消息，
  屈指归来已误期。立即就迁居。夜难行，淫雨苦兼旬。野营已自无篷帐，
  大树遮身待天明。几番梦不成。天放晴，对月设野营。轻风徐来催睡意，
  万松森森若云屯。梦中念敌情。莫玩笑，耳语请放低。林外难免无敌探，
  前面咳嗽泄事机。纠偏要心虚。叹缺粮，三月肉不尝。夏吃杨梅冬剥笋，
  猎取野猪遍山忙。捉蛇二更长。满山抄，草木变枯焦。敌人屠杀空前古，
  人民反抗气更高。再请把兵交。讲战术，稳坐钓鱼台。敌人找我偏不打，
  他不防备我偏来。乖乖听安排。靠人民，支援永不忘。他是重生亲父母，
  我是斗争好儿郎。革命强中强。勤学习，落伍实堪悲。此日准备好身手，
  他年战场获锦归。前进心不灰。莫怨嗟，稳脚度岁华。强寇北国问周鼎，
  大军西去渡金沙。抗日要开花。
