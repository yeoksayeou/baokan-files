Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 4th - The organizational process of the counter-revolutionary group that brutally murdered seven cadres and residents in Yatang Market, Lianjiang County, Guangdong Province on July 12 (reported on page 2 of this newspaper on July 27), has been clarified after being tried by the Zhanjiang District Intermediate People's Court.

The chief instigator of this counter-revolutionary riot was named Yang Daohua, a native of Longwan Township, Lianjiang County. Since 1955, he had been proclaiming that he possessed magical weapons such as a treasure sword, a treasure gourd, and invisibility water, claiming that with a wave of the "treasure sword," he could kill everyone within fifty *li*. He used this to bewilder backward masses. In July 1956, he colluded with a group of counter-revolutionary elements from nearby townships to organize the so-called "Chinese People's National Pacification Army." The initial participants in this counter-revolutionary organization included Gao Huizhen, Luo Jiyun, and others.

From then on, this group of counter-revolutionary elements began to actively develop their organization in Lianjiang County. Their main targets for recruitment were landlords, rich peasants, released prisoners, and people dissatisfied with the government. On the one hand, they continued to promote their "treasure sword" and "treasure gourd" magical weapons. On the other hand, they expanded their organization through kinship and by connecting with backward elements. In addition, they seized on individual shortcomings in the government's work to provoke and incite dissatisfaction among some farmers who had grievances, and then tried to win them over. To some young people who were not content to work in the countryside, they falsely claimed that they could find them jobs outside to lure them into joining the organization. They also used "fortune-telling" as a guise to confuse and deceive farmers. They would tell those who came to them for "fortune-telling": "Your horoscope indicates more misfortune than fortune, but there is a way to save you," and then trot out their so-called "treasure sword," "treasure gourd," and other tricks to lure others into their trap.

This counter-revolutionary organization convened its core members several times in June and July this year to plot an armed riot. They planned to first attack small market towns such as Yatang, and then continue to attack the county seat to establish a counter-revolutionary base.

At about 3:00 PM on July 12, more than 20 members of this counter-revolutionary organization, led by the chief culprits Luo Jiyun, Li Shaohan, Gao Huizhen, and others, attacked the Yatang Market grain station and supply and marketing cooperative in Lianhong County, killing a total of seven cadres, family members, and residents. After the incident, tens of thousands of people in Lianjiang County detained all the counter-revolutionary bandits who directly participated in the riot within two days, and subsequently captured more than a dozen remaining members. They also seized a 7.9mm rifle, a bayonet, four sharp knives, and the official seal of the "Chinese People's National Pacification Army," among other criminal evidence.

    杨道华反革命集团是怎样组成的？
    新华社广州4日电　广东省廉江县雅塘墟7月12日反革命集团惨杀七个干部和居民一案（载7月27日本报第二版）的组织经过，经湛江地区中级人民法院审理后，已经弄得清清楚楚。
    策动这次反革命暴动的总头子叫杨道华，廉江县龙湾乡人，他从1955年起就扬言有宝剑、葫芦宝、掩眼水等法宝，说“宝剑”一挥，能够把五十华里以内的人全部杀光；借此迷惑落后群众。1956年7月，他伙同附近乡的一批反革命分子组织了所谓“中国人民定国军”，首先参加这个反革命组织的有高惠珍、罗纪润等人。
    从此，这一伙反革命分子就开始在廉江县积极发展组织，他们发展组织的主要对象是地主、富农、释放犯和对政府不满的人。他们一面继续宣传他们有“宝剑”“葫芦宝”等法宝，一面通过以亲串亲、以落后串落后等方法来发展组织。此外，对一些有不满情绪的农民，则抓住政府工作中的个别缺点大肆挑拨，煽动他们对政府的不满，然后再来拉拢。对一些不安心在农村生产的青年人，就欺骗说他们能介绍出外工作来拉他们参加组织；他们还用“算命”作幌子来迷惑、欺骗农民，他们对前来找他们“算命”的人说：“你的八字凶多吉少，但是有一个办法可以解救”，跟着便搬出他们的所谓“宝剑”“葫芦宝”等一套把戏来，勾引别人落入他们的圈套。
    这个反革命组织曾在今年6、7月间召集他们手下的一批骨干分子先后多次集会，策划武装暴动，他们计划先攻打雅塘等小墟镇，然后继续攻打县城，建立反革命根据地。
    7月12日下午三时许，这个反革命组织的成员二十多人，就在首恶分子罗纪润、李绍汉、高惠珍等率领下，攻打廉红县雅塘墟粮站和供销社等部门，打死干部、家属和居民共七人。案件发生后，廉江县成千上万的群众在两天内把直接参加这次暴动的反革命匪徒全部拘获，其后并陆续捕获余党十多人，并缴获七九步枪一枝、刺刀一把、尖刀四把，“中国人民定国军”方印一枚等犯罪证物。
