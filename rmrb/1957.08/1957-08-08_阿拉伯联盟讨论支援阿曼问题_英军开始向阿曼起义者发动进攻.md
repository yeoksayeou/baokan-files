Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, August 6th: Representatives of the Arab League member states held a meeting today at the Arab League headquarters in Cairo to discuss a unified plan to support the struggle of the Omani people.

According to Cairo Radio, the meeting discussed the possibility of submitting the Oman issue to the United Nations Security Council.

After the meeting, Arab League Secretary-General Hassouna said that the meeting had not made any decisions. The representatives need to consult with their governments before taking a final position on the Oman issue.

Yemeni Minister to Egypt, Taleb, said: "Yemen has decided to support the Imam of Oman materially, morally, and politically, because the struggle of Oman is of the utmost importance to all Arabs." He also said, "The events in Oman once again prove the barbarity and brutality of Britain."

Xinhua News Agency, August 7th: Manama (in Bahrain) News: A British military spokesman announced in Manama today that British ground forces have begun attacking Omani insurgents and have occupied the village of Izki, about twenty-five miles from Nizwa, the headquarters of the Omani insurgents.

This British force, under the cover of jet aircraft and armored vehicles, departed from the Faud base. The force includes British Cameronians and Trucial Oman Scouts. It is said that no resistance was encountered during the eighty-mile advance from Faud.

The spokesman said that before the British troops entered Izki, British Air Force bombers dropped leaflets on the residents of Izki, coercing them to assist the British forces.

    阿拉伯联盟讨论支援阿曼问题
    英军开始向阿曼起义者发动进攻
    据新华社开罗6日电　阿拉伯联盟成员国的代表今天在开罗阿拉伯联盟总部举行会议，讨论支援阿曼人民的斗争的统一计划。
    据开罗电台广播，这次会议讨论了把阿曼问题提交联合国安全理事会的可能性。
    会后，阿拉伯联盟秘书长哈苏纳说，这次会议没有作出任何决定。代表们要在请示他们的政府之后才能就阿曼问题采取最后的态度。
    也门驻埃及公使塔列布说：“也门已经决定在物质上、道义上和政治上支持阿曼教长，因为阿曼的斗争对于所有阿拉伯人是具有最大的重要性的。”他还说，“阿曼的事件再一次证明了英国的野蛮和残暴”。
    新华社7日讯　马纳马（在巴林岛）消息：据英国军方发言人今天在马纳马宣布，英国地面部队已经开始向阿曼起义者发动进攻，并且占领了距离阿曼起义者总部所在地尼兹瓦约二十五英里的伊兹村。
    在喷气式飞机和装甲车掩护下的这批英国部队是从法乌德基地出发的。这批部队包括有英国的凯麦隆人部队和特鲁西尔阿曼侦察兵。据说，在从法乌德出发的八十英里进攻途中都没有遇到抵抗。
    发言人说，在英军开进伊兹之前，英国空军轰炸机曾经向伊兹居民投掷传单，胁迫他们协助英军。
