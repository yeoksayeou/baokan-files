    Double Harvest
    When ideas are grasped by the masses, they become a tremendous material force.

    After carrying out socialist and patriotic education in rural areas in provinces such as Shanxi, Hunan, and Sichuan, and overcoming the departmentalism and individualism of some cadres and peasants, the situation in grain unified purchase and sales and public grain collection work quickly changed dramatically.

    This fact illustrates that the current grain problem is primarily an ideological problem; once the ideological problem is resolved, grain work will be easier to do. If socialist thought does not grasp the masses, the masses will lose their way; as long as socialist thought approaches the masses, the masses will love it.

    Strengthening ideological work promotes grain work, which is a great harvest. Raising the ideological level of the masses through the great debate on the grain issue is another great harvest. Ideological gains will transform into even greater material strength than the grain obtained this time.

    双重的收获
    思想掌握了群众，就会成为巨大的物质力量。
    山西、湖南、四川等省，在农村进行了社会主义、爱国主义教育，克服了一部分干部和农民的本位主义、个人主义思想以后，粮食统购统销和公粮征收工作的局面很快就有了大转变。
    这事实说明了：当前的粮食问题主要是思想问题；思想问题解决了，粮食工作也就好做了。社会主义思想如果不去掌握群众，群众就会迷失方向；社会主义思想只要接近群众，群众就会热爱它。
    加强了思想工作，就推进了粮食工作，这是一个大收获。通过粮食问题的大辩论，提高了群众的思想水平，这又是一个大收获。思想上的收获，将会变成比这一次得到的粮食更多更大的物质力量。
