A Heated Debate at the Yunnan People's Congress
Rightists Utterly Defeated
The Fallacies of Gong Zizhi, Qin Fengxiang, Ma Bo'an, and Others in Provoking Discord Between the Party and People of All Ethnic Groups Thoroughly Bankrupt

    According to Xinhua News Agency, at the fourth session of the First Yunnan Provincial People's Congress, which closed on the 27th, representatives of more than twenty ethnic groups used facts from their own experiences to defeat the bourgeois rightists' rampant attacks on the Communist Party.
    During the eleven days of group meetings and general discussions, representatives of all ethnic groups focused on refuting the rightists' reactionary fallacies, which attempted to abolish the Communist Party's leadership over the people of all ethnic groups, provoke discord between ethnic groups and within ethnic groups, and deny the province's great achievements in various fields.
    The representatives pointed out that the claims made by rightists like Gong Zizhi that Yunnan Province was "a great bumper harvest on one side and people starving to death on the other" and that "the lives of ethnic minorities are not as good as before liberation" were malicious lies. The representatives pointed out that the grain income of the people of all ethnic groups in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture and the Dehong Dai-Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture had increased from an average of 400 jin per person per year before liberation to 700 to 900 jin. Even in the more underdeveloped mountainous areas, the average income was more than 600 jin of raw grain per person per year, fundamentally changing the situation of "mountain grass and wild vegetables for every family" and "mountains and rivers exhausted, no way to go." Three representatives from the Gengma Dai-Va Autonomous County pointed out that it was precisely when these rightists ruled Yunnan in the past that people truly starved to death. In Gengma County town, with only four to five hundred people, at least ten people starved to death every year before liberation. However, after liberation, the county's grain output has increased almost doubled every year, ending the era of starvation long ago.
    The representatives of all ethnic groups thoroughly refuted the fallacies of rightist Qin Fengxiang, who said that the Communist Party "talks about equality for ethnic minorities, but in reality, it is unequal," "the Communist Party is good to the large ethnic groups but not to the small ethnic groups," and "now that regional autonomy has been implemented, Han cadres should no longer be kept in autonomous organs." The representatives pointed out that precisely in the ethnic minority areas where the Kuomintang reactionaries implemented so-called "colonialization" and "supervision," five ethnic autonomous prefectures, thirteen autonomous counties, and many ethnic townships have been established in recent years. The Dulong and Nu peoples, who suffered the deepest oppression in history and have a total population of only three thousand to ten thousand, have also established autonomous political power, realizing the right to be masters of their own affairs under the leadership of the Communist Party. Representatives from the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture recalled the Kuomintang army's massacre of the Yaole people, saying, "They burned down the Yaole people's villages and tea gardens, killing the Yaole people, whose original population of more than 10,000 was reduced to just over 3,000, forcing this ethnic group, which had already progressed to using oxen to plow the fields, back to the primitive slash-and-burn era. In those dark days, ethnic groups did not even have the right to survive, let alone any equal rights." The heads of the Xishuangbanna and Dehong autonomous prefectures stated in their speeches that the number of ethnic minority cadres in the two places had grown rapidly in recent years, accounting for more than 40% of the total number of cadres. The growth of ethnic minority cadres shows that the assistance of advanced ethnic groups is indispensable.
    The lie spread by rightist Ma Bo'an that the democratic reforms had "split" ethnic minorities was also refuted by representatives of all ethnic groups at the meeting. Dai representatives pointed out that since the implementation of democratic reforms in the border areas, ethnic groups in the mountains have been freed from the exploitation of Dai landlords. A new type of ethnic relationship has emerged among ethnic groups. Mountain ethnic groups no longer call the Dai people "Bo" (master); the Dai people no longer call mountain ethnic groups "Ka" (slave), but call each other "Bi Nong" (brother).
    The representatives believed that the rightists' claim that "cooperativization is not suitable for ethnic minority areas" was a reactionary slander that intentionally obscured the facts. For example, in the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture, which has a population of more than 1.5 million, 80% of cooperative members' households increased their income in the first year of achieving advanced cooperativization. Among the first batch of sixty-seven cooperatives established in the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture, 97% of the cooperatives increased production, and some even increased production by more than 80%. The rightists are actually opposed to the people of all ethnic groups taking the socialist road to common prosperity.
    Representatives of all ethnic groups unanimously agreed that the anti-communist remarks spread by rightists such as Gong Zizhi and Lu Guofan, which attempted to abolish the Communist Party's leadership over the people of all ethnic groups and demanded that the Communist Party be in a "detached" position and retreat "behind the scenes," were absolutely intolerable to the broad masses of people of all ethnic groups. Dao Jingban said: "Whether the Communist Party is good or the old reactionary ruling clique is good, the people of our ethnic minorities have already clearly distinguished from their own practical life experience. On this point, the sense of smell of our ethnic minority people is extremely sensitive." The representatives pointed out that thanks to the leadership of the Communist Party, the people of all ethnic groups not only obtained equal political rights and greatly improved their economic and cultural lives, but also universally reversed the fate of gradual population decline and even the crisis of ethnic groups facing serious danger. The rapid development of health care has led to a gradual increase in the population of all ethnic groups. It can be seen that only the leadership of the Communist Party can guarantee the common prosperity of all ethnic groups.

    云南人代会上一场激辩
　　右派分子被驳得大败亏输
　　龚自知秦凤翔马伯安等挑拨党和各族人民关系的谬论彻底破产
    据新华社讯　27日闭幕的云南省第一届人民代表大会第四次会议上，包括二十多种民族的代表们以各族人民亲身经历的事实，击败了资产阶级右派分子对共产党的猖狂进攻。
    在历时十一天的小组会议和大会讨论中，各族代表着重批驳了右派分子妄图取消共产党对各族人民的领导、挑拨各族人民之间和民族内部的团结，以及否定全省各项工作巨大成就的反动谬论。
    代表们指出，右派分子龚自知等人所谓云南省是“一面大丰收，一面饿死人”和“少数民族生活不如解放以前好”的说法，是别具心肝的一派胡言。代表们指出，西双版纳傣族自治州和德宏傣族景颇族自治州各族人民的粮食收入，已经由解放前平均每人每年四百斤，增加至七百到九百斤，在生产比较落后的山区，每人每年也平均收入原粮六百多斤，基本上改变了那种“山茅野菜千家饭”、“山穷水尽无路走”的生活状况。耿马傣族佧佤族自治县的三位代表指出，正是这些右派分子过去统治云南的时候，才是真正饿死人的时代。只有四、五百人的耿马县城，解放前每年至少饿死十多人，但是，解放后全县的粮食产量每年几乎平均增长一倍，早已结束了那种饿死人的时代。
    各民族的代表彻底批驳了右派分子秦凤翔说共产党对少数民族“讲的是平等、实际上是不平等”，
  “共产党对大民族好，对小民族不好”，“既然实行了区域自区，就不应该叫汉族干部再留在自治机关里”等谬论。代表们指出，正是在国民党反动派实行所谓“殖边”“督办”的民族地区，几年来已经建立了五个民族自治州、十三个自治县和许多民族乡。历史上受压迫最深、总人口只有三千到一万多人的独龙人和怒族人民，也都建立了自治政权，实现了在共产党领导下当家作主的权利。西双版纳傣族自治州的代表回忆起国民党军队屠杀攸乐人的情况说：“他们烧毁了攸乐人的村寨和茶园，把原有一万多人的攸乐人杀得只剩下三千多人，迫使这个已经进步到用牛犁地的民族又回到原始的刀耕火种的时代。在那样黑暗的日子里，各民族连生存的权利都没有，还有什么平等权利可言？”西双版纳、德宏两个自治州的州长在发言中都认为，两地的少数民族干部几年来增长很快，已占到干部总数的40％以上，从少数民族干部的成长上也可看出不能没有先进民族的帮助。
    右派分子马伯安所散布的民主改革把少数民族“搞得四分五裂”的谎言，在会上也受到了各族代表的驳斥。傣族代表们指出，自从边疆实行民主改革，山区民族摆脱了傣族领主的剥削以后，各民族间已出现了新型的民族关系，山区民族不再称傣族为“波”（老爷）；傣族也不再叫山区民族为“卡”（奴隶），而互相称为“比浓”（兄弟）。
    代表们认为：右派分子所谓“合作化不适合民族地区”的说法，是一种有意抹煞事实的反动谰言。例如，拥有一百五十多万人口的大理白族自治州，在实现了高级合作化的第一年，就有80％的社员农户增加了收入。怒江傈僳族自治州试办的第一批六十七个合作社中，有97％的社增加了生产，有的甚至增产80％以上。右派分子们，实际上是反对各族人民走共同富裕的社会主义道路。
    各族代表一致认为，龚自知、禄国藩等右派分子所散布的企图取消共产党对各族人民的领导、要求共产党处于“超然”地位和退居“幕后”的反共言论，是各族广大人民所绝不能容忍的。刀京版说：“究竟是共产党好还是旧日的反动统治集团好，我们少数民族人民已经从自己实际生活的体验中辨得清清楚楚，在这一点上，我们少数民族人民的嗅觉是再灵敏不过的了。”代表们指出，由于有了共产党的领导，各族人民不但在政治上获得了平等权利、经济文化生活有了很大改善，而且，各民族还普遍扭转了人口逐渐减少甚至民族趋于严重危机的命运。卫生事业的迅速发展使各民族的人口正在逐渐增加。可见只有共产党的领导，各民族才有共同繁荣的保证。
