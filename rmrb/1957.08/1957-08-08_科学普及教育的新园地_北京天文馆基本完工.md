A new garden for popular science education
Beijing Planetarium Basically Completed

Outside Xizhimen stands a circular building with a red copper dome, echoing the gilded spire of the Soviet Exhibition Center. This is the newly built Beijing Planetarium. Its construction is now basically complete, and the final decoration and painting work is underway.

The main project of the planetarium, the planetarium theater, has already begun to receive guests in advance. On the day after this year's Army Day, 6,000 officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army took a "space trip" here to explore the secrets of the starry sky. They got a sneak peek at a comet that will appear in the Beijing sky in 1986, twenty-nine years later. In the center of this planetarium theater stands a planetarium projector that looks like a dumbbell, capable of projecting more than 9,000 artificial stars onto the dome screen. It can demonstrate the changes in the starry sky throughout the four seasons, as well as the appearance of the starry sky thousands or tens of thousands of years ago and in the future. The front hall of the planetarium theater also features huge murals of Chang'e flying to the moon and the Cowherd and Weaver Girl created by artists Wu Zuoren, Ai Zhongxin, and others. To the right is an exhibition hall, and to the left is a lecture hall and a science education film screening room. Outside the planetarium theater, there are also small astronomical observatories and meteorological stations; a large area to the west will be built into an astronomical plaza.

The planetarium is a garden for popular science education, educating the masses with a materialist worldview of the universe, enabling them to correctly understand the universe. Its equipment is supplied by the German Democratic Republic. Currently, there are only more than twenty planetariums of this scale in the world.

    科学普及教育的新园地
    北京天文馆基本完工
    西直门外有一栋圆形红铜盖顶的建筑物，同苏联展览馆的镏金尖顶遥相辉映。这就是新建的北京天文馆。现在它的建筑工程已经基本完工，正在进行最后的装修、粉饰工作。
    天文馆的主要工程天象厅已经开始提前接待客人。今年建军节的次日，有六千位解放军官兵在这里进行“宇宙旅行”，探索星空的秘密。他们提前看到了二十九年以后，也就是1986年北京地区天空上将要出现的一颗彗星。在这个天象厅中央放着一架外表像哑铃的天象仪，可以在圆顶银幕上放射出九千多颗人造星。一年四季的星空变化，以及几千年前和几万年后星空的情况，它都能够表演。天象厅前厅还有美术家吴作人、艾中信等人创作的嫦娥奔月、牛郎织女巨幅壁画。右边是一个展览厅，左边是演讲厅和科学教育影片放映厅。天象厅外面，还有小型天文台和气象台；往西一大片地区将建成天文广场。
    天文馆是进行科学普及教育的园地，以唯物主义的宇宙观来教育群众，使群众正确地认识宇宙。它的设备是由民主德国供给的。目前世界上像这样规模的天文馆也只有二十多个。北京天文馆天象厅外景，左侧是气象台。
