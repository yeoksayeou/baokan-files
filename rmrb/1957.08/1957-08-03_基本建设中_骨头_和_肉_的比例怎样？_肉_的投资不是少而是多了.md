Xinhua News Agency, August 2nd. Xinhua News Agency reporter Li Feng reports: Recently, in my contacts with some responsible persons and experts from the central economic construction departments, I found that their views on the relationship between "bones" and "meat" in the first four years of the Five-Year Plan have turned a full 180 degrees: investment in "meat" is not less, but more.

"Bones" usually refers to capital construction in industry, universities, colleges, scientific research institutions, etc.; "meat" refers to capital construction in dormitories, culture, education, health, trade, post and telecommunications, and urban public utilities.

Since the end of last year, many people have believed that the relationship between "bones" and "meat" is somewhat imbalanced, with too much investment in the former and too little in the latter.

According to relatively conservative estimates from relevant parties, in the first four years of the Five-Year Plan, the state planned and extra-planned non-productive construction totaled more than 160 million square meters. Among them, residential buildings alone accounted for more than 65 million square meters. In 1956, the number of film projection units increased by more than 6,300 compared to 1952; the number of theaters increased by 744; the number of hospitals increased by more than 460, with an increase of more than 100,000 hospital beds; the number of sanatoriums increased by 529, with an increase of more than 46,000 sanatorium beds. The capital construction of these cultural, educational, and health undertakings has increased several times compared to 1949. The funds spent on non-productive construction in the first four years are estimated to be over 9 billion yuan.

The investment ratio of "bones" to "meat" can be illustrated by some materials provided by relevant parties:

According to materials provided by the State Construction Commission, in sixteen cities such as Beijing, Wuhan, and Taiyuan, the investment ratio of "bones" to "meat" in the first four years was approximately two to one. It is estimated that the investment ratio between the two throughout the country during the first Five-Year Plan may be close to the above ratio. According to calculations by relevant departments, the above ratio is not much different from the investment ratio in this aspect during the Soviet Union's first Five-Year Plan.

Based on the above facts, some experts have concluded that investment in "meat" is not small. If we build houses, cinemas, and hospitals, etc., without limit, and increase the investment ratio of "meat" without limit, our country's economic construction will develop into a "fat man" state, and will suffer from "osteomalacia"; industrial construction and other economic construction will be difficult to move forward quickly.

If we consider the situation that the construction standards of many dormitories, office buildings, and urban public utilities are too high and the construction is too early, the investment in "meat" may be even more. For example, in some new industrial cities, before a new factory is even built, multi-story guesthouses, high-standard office buildings, large auditoriums, large clubs, dormitories, etc., have been built in large numbers.

Since the relationship between "bones" and "meat" was raised at the end of last year, the heads and experts of some central departments have been paying attention to investigating and studying this issue. The current new view shows that the state may no longer increase the investment ratio of "meat" or appropriately reduce the ratio in this area; this will allow more money to be invested in construction in areas such as industry and scientific research.

Based on the results of investigation and research, many economic experts are studying the ratio of "bones" to "meat" during the second Five-Year Plan period.

Here, one can often hear the heads of some central departments say that in the socialist construction of our country, finding the correct ratio of various economic constructions takes time, several years or even more than ten years, and also requires economic costs.

### 基本建设中“骨头”和“肉”的比例怎样？  “肉”的投资不是少而是多了

    基本建设中“骨头”和“肉”的比例怎样？
    “肉”的投资不是少而是多了
    新华社2日讯　新华社记者李峰报道：最近记者同中央经济建设部门的一些负责人和专家们接触中，发现他们对于五年计划前四年“骨头”同“肉”的关系问题的看法转了个一百八十度的大弯：“肉”的投资不是少而是多了。
    “骨头”通常是指工业、大专学校、科学研究机关等方面的基本建设；“肉”是指宿舍、文教卫生、贸易、邮电和城市公用事业等基本建设。
    去年年底以来，很多人认为“骨头”同“肉”的关系有些失调，前者投资太多，后者投资太少。
    据有关方面比较保守的估计，五年计划前四年，国家计划内和计划外的非生产性的建筑，共建筑了一亿六千多万平方公尺。其中仅住宅就有六千五百多万平方公尺。1956年，电影放映单位，比1952年增加了六千三百多个；剧场增加了七百四十四个；医院增加了四百六十多个，医院的床位增加了十万张以上，疗养院增加了五百二十九个，疗养院的床位增加了四万六千多张。这些文教卫生事业的基本建设比1949年都增加了几倍，前四年非生产性的建设花的资金，估计在九十亿元以上。
    “骨头”同“肉”的投资比重，有关方面提供的一些材料可以展示出一个轮廓：
    据国家建设委员会提供的材料，北京、武汉和太原等十六个城市，前四年“骨头”和“肉”的投资比例，大约是二比一；预计全国第一个五年计划两者的投资比例也可能接近上述比例。据有关部门的计算，上述比例同苏联第一个五年计划这方面的投资比例也相差不多。
    根据上述事实，有的专家得出结论说，“肉”的投资并不少。如果无限制地盖房子，建电影院和医院等等，无限制地增加对“肉”的投资比重，我国的经济建设就会发展成“大胖子”状态，就会患“软骨症”；工业建设和其它经济建设就难以快步前进。
    如果考虑到很多宿舍、办公大楼和城市公用事业等方面建筑标准过高和建设过早的情况，“肉”的投资还可能多了一些。例如有的新工业城市，新建的工厂还未建成一个，几层大楼的招待所，高标准的办公大楼、大礼堂、大俱乐部、宿舍等等就盖了很多。
    从去年年底提出“骨头”同“肉”的关系以来，中央一些部门的负责人和专家们一直在注意调查研究这个问题。目前这种新的看法表明，国家可以不再增加“肉”的投资比重或适当减少这方面的比重；这就可以用更多的钱来投入工业和科学研究等方面的建设。
    根据调查研究的结果，很多经济专家正在研究第二个五年计划期间“骨头”同“肉”的比例问题。
    此间经常可以听到中央一些部门的负责人说，在我国社会主义的建设中，要找到各种经济建设的正确比例，是需要时间的，需要几年甚至十几年，而且还需要经济上的代价。
