Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 13th. Indonesian Communist Party General Secretary Aidit, today issued a statement regarding Indonesian Nationalist Party Chairman Suwirjo's statement on party cooperation issued on the 12th, saying that the Indonesian Communist Party will strive to ensure that in areas where it achieves an absolute victory in the upcoming local council elections, all parties can cooperate, first and foremost to improve the cooperation between the Indonesian Nationalist Party and the Communist Party. Aidit pointed out that in these areas, the Indonesian Communist Party is always willing to consult on how to handle the cooperation of all democratic parties supporting President Sukarno's program.

Aidit believes that Suwirjo's statement is "realistic" because Suwirjo refuses to cooperate with a certain political party without prejudice, and emphasizes that the issue of whether or not to cooperate should be decided based on the specific circumstances. Aidit believes that in areas where the Indonesian Communist Party wins an absolute victory in local council elections, the Nationalist Party should also not be prejudiced against cooperation, and it is best to continue practical cooperation.

Aidit pointed out that the so-called "Nationalist-Communist cooperation" that has existed for a long time has been beneficial. While the Nationalist Party continues to implement anti-colonialist and democratic policies, the Indonesian Communist Party will continue to support the cabinet in which the Nationalist Party occupies an important position; however, if the Nationalist Party abandons this reasonable policy and turns back to implement the anti-democratic and anti-people policies of the Sukiman (Masjumi party leader) cabinet that the Nationalist Party previously supported, then the Indonesian Communist Party cannot support it.

### 艾地就苏维约声明发表谈话  希望印度尼西亚国民党共产党更好合作

    艾地就苏维约声明发表谈话
    希望印度尼西亚国民党共产党更好合作
    新华社雅加达13日电　印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地今天就国民党总主席苏维约在12日发表的关于印度尼西亚党派合作问题的声明发表谈话说，印度尼西亚共产党将设法在这次地方议会选举中它自己获得绝对胜利的地方，使各党派能够合作，首先是使印度尼西亚国民党和共产党两个党的合作更加良好。艾地指出，在这些地方，印度尼西亚共产党始终愿意就如何处理支持苏加诺总统方案的各民主党派的合作问题进行协商。
    艾地认为，苏维约的声明是“现实的”，因为苏维约不抱有成见地拒绝和某一政党合作，而强调是否合作的问题应当根据具体情况来决定。艾地认为，在印度尼西亚共产党获得地方议会选举的绝对胜利的地方，国民党也不应当抱有成见地对合作采取反对态度，最好还是继续进行切实的合作。
    艾地指出，长期以来存在着的所谓“国共合作”是有好处的。在国民党仍然执行反殖民主义和民主的政策的时候，印度尼西亚共产党将继续支持国民党在其中占有重要地位的内阁；但是，如果国民党放弃这个合情合理的政策，回过头来执行以前国民党支持过的苏基曼（马斯友美党领袖）内阁的反民主和反人民的政策，那么印度尼西亚共产党就不可能支持它。
