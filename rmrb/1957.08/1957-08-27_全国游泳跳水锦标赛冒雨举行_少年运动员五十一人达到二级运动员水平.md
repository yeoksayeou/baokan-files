　　National Swimming and Diving Championships Held in the Rain

　　Fifty-One Young Athletes Reach Second-Class Athlete Level

    This newspaper reports The National Swimming and Diving Championships continued on the 26th, with more than 500 athletes participating in the competition despite the rain. Due to the poor weather, the athletes' performances were affected, but encouraging results still emerged. Mu Xiangxiong's time in the 100-meter breaststroke was close to the world record. Young athletes created excellent results, with a total of 51 reaching the level of second-class athletes.
    The men's 100-meter breaststroke final was the most closely watched event by the audience. At the start of the race, the seven athletes were almost in a straight line. After advancing about twenty meters, Mu Xiangxiong from Tianjin began to break away from this line. After the turn, his movements appeared even more steady and swift. At this time, only Mo Guoxiong from Guangdong Province was closely following him. In the final fifteen meters, Mu Xiangxiong accelerated, sprinting forward with all his might, and finally took first place with a time of 1 minute 13.6 seconds. This result was only 0.6 seconds short of the world record standard of 1 minute 13 seconds. Mo Guoxiong took second place with a time of 1 minute 15.3 seconds. The famous athlete Qi Lieyun did not participate in the final due to feeling unwell.
    The adult women's Group A 100-meter backstroke final was very eye-catching. Yu Bizhen, an athlete from the Chinese People's Liberation Army, took first place with a time of 1 minute 26.9 seconds. The famous backstroke swimmer Fu Cuimei did not participate in this final due to health problems.
    The adult men's Group A 200-meter freestyle final was also fiercely contested. The famous swimming star Lin Jinzhu took first place with a time of 2 minutes 12 seconds.
    In the men's and women's junior 100-meter freestyle and men's junior 100-meter breaststroke finals held yesterday, a total of 50 athletes achieved the second-class athlete standard, and one athlete achieved the first-class athlete standard. These results far exceeded the third-class athlete standard required by the conference.
    Sixteen-year-old Guangzhou athlete Lu Xixia's time in the 100-meter freestyle yesterday was 1 minute 2.1 seconds, reaching the first-class athlete standard of 1 minute 4 seconds. He has only been formally practicing swimming for a little over a year.
    A total of seventeen swimming finals, seven swimming preliminary rounds, one diving preliminary round, and three diving finals were held yesterday.

    男子百公尺蛙泳决赛，是观众最关心的一个项目。比赛开始，七名运动员几乎是在一条横线上。前进了约二十多公尺，天津市运动员穆祥雄开始突破了这条横线，拐弯后，他的动作显得更加稳健迅速。这时，只有广东省莫国雄紧紧盯在他的后面。最后只有十五公尺时，穆祥雄加快了速度，一股劲地向前冲刺，终于以一分十三秒六的成绩取得第一名，这个成绩仅比一分十三秒的世界纪录标准差零点六秒。莫国雄以一分十五秒三得第二名。著名运动员戚烈云因为身体不舒服没有参加这项决赛。
    成人女子甲组百公尺仰泳决赛十分引人注意，中国人民解放军运动员余碧珍以一分二十六秒九取得第一名。著名仰泳选手傅翠美因身体不好没有参加这项决赛。
    成人男子甲组二百公尺自由泳决赛也争夺得十分激烈，著名游泳健将林锦珠以二分十二秒的成绩得第一名。
    在昨天举行的男、女少年百公尺自由泳和男子少年百公尺蛙游决赛中，共有五十人的成绩达到二级运动员标准，一人的成绩达到了一级运动员标准。这些成绩远远地超过了大会要求达到的三级运动员标准的规定。
    广州市十六岁的少年运动员卢细虾，昨天百公尺自由泳的成绩是一分二秒一，达到一分四秒的一级运动员的标准。他正式练习游泳还只有一年多的时间。
    昨天总共举行了十七项游泳决赛、七项游泳预赛、一项跳水预赛和三项跳水决赛。
