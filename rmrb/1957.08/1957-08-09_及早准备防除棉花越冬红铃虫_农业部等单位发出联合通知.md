Xinhua News Agency report: The Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation, and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives issued a joint notice on August 5 regarding the prevention and control of overwintering cotton bollworm.

The notice stated that significant achievements were made in preventing and controlling overwintering cotton bollworm last winter and this spring. However, overall, the prevention and control work was very uneven, and some units did not carry out the work or did not do it thoroughly.

The notice pointed out that this year is the second year of implementing Article 18 of the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) from 1956 to 1967, which stipulates that cotton bollworm damage should be eliminated in seven to twelve years. Making efforts to do a good job in preventing and controlling overwintering cotton bollworm this winter and next spring will lay the foundation for eliminating cotton bollworm during the second five-year plan period.

The notice requires agricultural departments of relevant provinces to convene relevant departments to formulate or revise the province's plan for eliminating cotton bollworm in conjunction with the second five-year plan, determine the plan for this winter and next spring, and make timely deployments. Before the cotton harvest, preparations should be made for publicity, training, medicines, and equipment, and a mass prevention and control campaign should be launched during the cotton harvest.

The notice also requires agricultural departments of relevant provinces to uniformly compile and print publicity materials, distribute them to grassroots prevention and control units in cotton-growing areas, and convene seminars on preventing and controlling overwintering cotton bollworm in conjunction with relevant departments to summarize and exchange experiences and study prevention and control plans. Special districts and counties should hold short-term technical training classes on preventing and controlling overwintering cotton bollworm, requiring at least one person in each prevention and control unit to master prevention and control techniques. Agricultural technology extension station personnel in cotton-growing areas should go deep into agricultural cooperatives, cotton purchasing stations, cotton ginning mills, and other prevention and control units during the cotton harvest season to provide technical guidance.

In order to cultivate typical examples of large-scale and thorough prevention and control of cotton bollworm, the notice requires demonstration areas in each province to strengthen leadership and determine key demonstration counties in the province to achieve significant results, organize visits, and expand influence. Among the demonstration counties in each province, Gaiping in Liaoning Province, Nangong in Hebei Province, Xinxiang (including Huojia) and Anyang in Henan Province, Xiazjin and Gaomi in Shandong Province, Jieyu in Shanxi Province, Huangmei in Hubei Province, and Dafeng in Jiangsu Province were designated as national demonstration areas.

The notice concluded by saying that the work of preventing and controlling overwintering cotton bollworm is an important issue related to increasing cotton production and improving the national economy. Relevant departments should immediately discuss and arrange the work after receiving the notice. Provincial departments should dispatch cadres to form joint inspection teams to inspect and promote work in counties and grassroots units.

    及早准备防除棉花越冬红铃虫
    农业部等单位发出联合通知
    据新华社讯　农业部、农垦部和全国供销合作总社等部门5日发出关于防除棉花越冬红铃虫的联合通知。
    通知说，去冬今春防除棉花越冬红铃虫有很大的成绩。但总的看来，防除工作开展得很不平衡，有些单位没有进行或进行得不彻底。
    通知指出，今年是执行1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（草案）第十八条规定七年到十二年消灭棉花红铃虫为害的第二年，努力做好今冬明春越冬红铃虫的防除工作，将为第二个五年计划期内消灭棉花红铃虫打下基础。
    通知要求有关各省农业部门召集有关部门，结合第二个五年计划，制定或修订本省的消灭棉花红铃虫的规划；确定今冬明春的计划，及时部署。在收花前，要做好宣传、训练、药械等准备工作，收花时开展群众性的防除运动。
    通知还要求有关各省农业厅统一编印宣传资料，分发到棉区基层防治单位，并联合有关部门召开防除越冬红铃虫座谈会，总结交流经验，研究防除计划。专区、县应举办防除越冬红铃虫技术短期训练班，要求每一个防除单位至少有一人能掌握防除技术。棉区农业技术推广站人员在收花季节，要深入农业社、收花站、轧花厂等防除单位，进行技术指导。
    为了培养大面积彻底防除棉花红铃虫的典型，通知要求各省示范区要加强领导，并确定全省重点示范县，切实做出显著成效，组织参观，扩大影响。在各省的示范县中，确定辽宁省盖平、河北省南宫、河南省新乡（包括获嘉）、安阳、山东省夏津、高密、山西省解虞、湖北省黄梅、江苏省大丰等县作为全国示范区。
    通知最后说，防除越冬红铃虫的工作是关系增产棉花改善国民经济的重要问题。有关部门接到通知后，应立即讨论布置。省级各部门应抽调干部组成联合检查组，到县及基层单位检查推动工作。
