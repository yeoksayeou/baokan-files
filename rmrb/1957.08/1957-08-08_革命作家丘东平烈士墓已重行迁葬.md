    Revolutionary Writer Qiu Dongping Martyr's Tomb Reburied

    (By our reporter) The investigation team sent by the Jianhu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Jiangsu Province, while investigating revolutionary martyrs, discovered that the revolutionary writer and Director of Education of the Huazhong Branch of the Lu Xun Academy of Arts, Martyr Qiu Dongping, was buried on the river slope under the automobile bridge north of the Guhua Temple in Liangqi District, Jianhu County. His tomb was just a small pile of earth, only a foot away from the water. After research by the county party committee, emergency measures were immediately taken to re-inter and bury Martyr Dongping. Now Martyr Dongping's remains have been buried on the newly built tomb base facing Dong Qiaojiazhuang. The scenery here is very good, surrounded by water on three sides, and the automobile highway from Yancheng to Huqi is nearby on the west side. After the Martyr's Pagoda is built, passengers in the carriages will be able to admire the Martyr Dongping's Pagoda.

    革命作家丘东平烈士墓已重行迁葬
    本报讯　由中共江苏建湖县委会派出的调查革命烈士的调查组，在调查中间，发现革命作家、鲁迅艺术学院华中分院教导主任丘东平烈士葬在建湖县梁契区古花寺北面汽车桥下的河坡上，其坟冢还有一小坯土堆，离水只有尺把远。经县委研究立即采取了紧急措施，为东平烈士重行收殓安葬。现在东平烈士遗体已在东乔家庄迎面新建墓基上安葬，这里风景很好，三面环水，西边靠近由盐城通往湖契的汽车公路，待烈士塔建成后，来往旅客在车厢内就能瞻仰到东平烈士塔。
