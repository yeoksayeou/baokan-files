Exposing the Secret of Zhang Naiqi's Trade in "Antiques"
　　Wang Yeqiu
　　In July 1949, I was working in the Higher Education Committee and Cultural Relics Department of the then North China People's Government. One day, a letter was forwarded to me. It was from Zhang Naiqi to Guo Moruo and Comrade Li Yimang. Besides a few short lines in the letter, there was an attached opinion paper titled: "A Proposal to Intensify the Excavation of the Cultural Mine."
　　The proposal began by saying: "Due to having five thousand years of history, China has a special product—the cultural mine. ... So, it is not an exaggeration at all to say that we have a special product called the cultural mine. ... Chinese antiques are likely to be an inexhaustible special product for the next hundred years."
　　He then wrote: "Therefore, I believe that a blanket ban on the export of antiques is unwise. On the one hand, we are giving up a not insignificant source of foreign exchange. On the other hand, from the antique business in Liulichang, Beijing, ... to the more fundamental diggers in the Central Plains, they are all suffering from the economic downturn."
　　"Due to my suggestion, the North China People's Government has already ordered the permission to export modern antiques without historical value. This is not enough because whether or not something has historical value is not about being ancient or modern. Most ancient relics do not have historical value and can be shipped out to exchange for foreign exchange."
　　He also said: "A Ding (ancient Chinese cauldron) can sell for seven or eight thousand US dollars in the United States, which gives me some comfort. The cost of buying antiques for several months is still less than two-thirds of the price of a Ding in the United States. However, just in terms of Dings, I have more than twenty."
　　Immediately following, he firmly advocated for the "direct export" of antiques, "As for the industries directly and indirectly related to antiques, they can be revitalized, and the cultural mine can be accelerated for exploitation, which is an inevitable result."
　　He said, "I now have roughly four hundred antiques, mostly bronze and porcelain. Just exporting one bronze Ding would make the four hundred antiques worth nothing..."
　　Finally, he said: "My purchasing power is almost exhausted, and I only plan to buy a few special items in the future. As long as the government starts buying, I will stop immediately to avoid competition..." He also said, "My items are not for sale and can be recorded and filed, so this proposal has nothing to do with my personal interests."
　　This is the main content of the proposal written by Zhang Naiqi himself on July 12, 1949. At the time, after we read it, we thought it was absurd and a downright traitor who insisted on selling the cultural heritage of the motherland. However, because he was wearing a label of a democratic person, the Higher Education Committee of the North China People's Government politely rejected it.
　　Now, re-examining the archives, the memory is still fresh. Why did Zhang Naiqi write this "proposal"? It just so happened that it was related to his last hurried statement that "this proposal has nothing to do with my personal interests."
　　Right-wingers like Zhang Naiqi and Zhang Bojun, when the Party Central Committee invited them to the Northeast to discuss national affairs, heard the news of the liberation of Jinan on the way. Zhang Bojun believed that "the situation was over." Then the Huaihai Campaign also started. In the two months and five days of the battle, about 600,000 of Chiang Kai-shek's elite troops were wiped out. Right-wingers such as Zhang Bojun and Zhang Naiqi hated the United States for failing to provide effective assistance. They thought "Chiang Kai-shek is really useless" for ruining their "stalemate" and "three-way division of the world" that they had been planning day and night. On the other hand, Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and Deputy Commander Peng issued orders one after another to "resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely wipe out all enemies," using the power of thunder and the force of sweeping away fallen leaves to completely destroy the reactionary armed forces of Chiang Kai-shek, who was riding on the backs of the people and was supported in every possible way by American imperialism. Zhang Naiqi's so-called "see the political market" was such a "market" that was extremely unfavorable to the "third route" and "middle forces." In despair, he had to "do some economic calculations."
　　After "August 15th," in the Northeast, Puyi's "treasures" in his "palace" in Changchun were looted and scattered by his guards and subjects. Part of what Puyi carried personally was also scattered in Tonghua. The collections of landlords and bureaucrats were also sold off one after another. Zhang Naiqi and Zhang Bojun saw this "market," so they went in and out of antique shops every day, doing their "economic calculations."
　　They bought these cultural relics at extremely cheap prices and brought them to Beijing. At that time, the antique market in Beijing was sluggish, so they also purchased them in large quantities. Zhang Naiqi was eager to sell these antiques to the United States and once inquired about the "market" from Han Shouxuan, the deputy curator of the History Museum. When Curator Han told him that a Ding could sell for seven or eight thousand US dollars in the United States, Zhang Naiqi was overjoyed.
　　But an extremely disappointing, hateful, and gnashing of teeth incident happened to Zhang Naiqi. The then North China People's Government, in view of the serious situation of the cultural heritage of our motherland being plundered, robbed, destroyed, searched and transported abroad by imperialists colluding with reactionary rulers and profiteers, tomb robbers, and bandits in the past hundred years (especially in the past thirty years), immediately issued the "Order to Prohibit the Export of Antiques and Books" on April 8, 1949. This decree stopped the catastrophe suffered by the cultural heritage of China in the past hundred years.
　　The loss of cultural relics in our country before liberation was tragic. For example, the entire ancient buildings of the Lama Temple in the former Suiyuan Province, the famous stone carvings of Yungang, Longmen, Tianlongshan Zhaoling Six Horses; the unearthed cultural relics from the tombs and sites of the Shang, Zhou, Warring States, Han, and Tang Dynasties in Xi'an, Luoyang, Anyang, Changsha, and other places; and the handed down paintings and books... all swept away, especially the United States imperialists robbed more, and openly claimed: "In the future, to study Chinese culture and art, one must come to the United States," "The United States saved the catastrophe of Chinese art!" All people with a little patriotism expressed their hatred for this, and this decree naturally received the support and cheers of the broad masses of the people. But it was hated by imperialists, warlords, bureaucrats, profiteers, and cultural traitors. Zhang Naiqi was one of these people. He did not dare to openly raise objections, but shouted the slogan of "exchanging for foreign exchange" and opposed this solemn decree everywhere. I remember that he repeatedly spread rumors to all parties, attacking this decree. When the attack was ineffective, he could not help but write this "proposal" himself. He openly advocated that antique profiteers collude with tomb robbers to open up the so-called "cultural mine"; advocated that "ancient relics do not have historical value, and all can be shipped out to exchange for foreign exchange!"
　　He believed that the state's prohibition of the export of antiques was "unwise," and allowing the export of modern antiques without historical value "was not enough." He advocated that all antiques should be "directly exported" and sold to foreign countries, especially the United States. He also stated that his "items" were not for sale; but now, according to the exposure, "last year, he sold more than 300 pieces of porcelain and bronze worth more than 1,400 yuan in three batches to antique dealer Pei Shunshan."
　　He stated that "the proposal has nothing to do with my personal interests." On the contrary, it has a great relationship with his personal interests, breaking his "economic calculation" of gold and dollars. Therefore, he attacked the state's decree so unscrupulously.
　　Isn't the intention and attempt of Zhang Naiqi, who resolutely opposed the state's prohibition of the export of cultural relics, wanted to wantonly destroy and rob the cultural heritage of the motherland, and resolutely advocated selling it to the United States, very obvious?
　　The above facts can also answer this question, without burning bones to ashes, you can see that he is anti-communist and anti-socialist.

　　揭穿章乃器买卖“古董”的秘密
　　王冶秋
    在1949年7月间，我在当时华北人民政府高教委员会、文物处工作，一天转来一封信，是章乃器写给郭老和李一氓同志的，短短的几行信以外，附了一份意见书，题目是：“一个加紧发掘文化矿的提议”
    提议开头说道：“由于有了五千年的历史，中国有一种特产——文化矿。……所以说我们有一种特产叫做文化矿，是一点都不是夸张的。……中国的古物，可能是今后百年间取之不竭的一种特产。”
    紧接着他又写道：“因此我认为笼统的禁止古物出口，是不聪明的。一面，我们放弃了一个为数不小的外汇来源。另一面，从北平琉璃厂的古玩业，……以至更基本的中原一带的挖坑的人们，都遭到不景气的灾难。
      “由于我的建议，华北人民政府已经下令准许近代的没有历史价值的古物出口。这是不够的，因为，有没有历史价值，并不在是古代或者近代。大多数的古代遗物，都不是有历史价值的，都是可以运出去换外汇的。”
    他又说：“一个鼎在美国，可以卖到七、八千美金，这使我得到一种安慰，几月来大买古玩的结果，所出的代价还抵不过一个鼎在美国的代价的三分之二。然而，单就鼎而言，我就有了二十多个。”
    紧接着他就坚决主张把古物“直接出口”，“至于直接间接和古玩有关的行业可以更生，文化矿可以加紧开采，更是必然的结果。”
    他说“我现在大致有四百件左右的古物，以铜瓷为多，只消出口一件铜鼎，四百件古物就等于无代价。……”
    最后他说：“我的购买力已差不多了，今后只准备买少数特殊物品，只要公家着手买，我就马上停止，以免双方争购……”他又说，“我的物品，是不出卖的，可以做纪录存案，所以，这一提议完全和我私人的利害无关。”
    这就是章乃器在1949年7月12日亲笔写的提议书的主要内容，当时我们看了以后，认为荒谬绝伦，是一个道地的坚决要出卖祖国文化遗产的汉奸。不过因为他挂着一个民主人士招牌，还是由华北人民政府高教委员会予以婉言拒绝。
    现在重翻档案，记忆犹新，为什么章乃器写这个“提议”呢？恰好就是他最后赶紧声明的“这一提议完全和我私人的利害无关”正有关系。
    章乃器、章伯钧等右派分子就在党中央约请他们去东北共商国事的时候，途中听到解放济南的消息，章伯钧就认为“大势已去”，接着淮海战役也打响了，在两个月零五天的战斗中，全歼蒋介石精锐部队约六十万人，章伯钧、章乃器等右派分子痛恨美国帮助不力，“蒋介石真不中用”，而把他们日夜以谋的“相持局面”、“三分天下”搞垮了；另一面毛主席、朱总司令、彭副总司令一道一道“坚决、彻底、干净、全部地歼灭一切敌人”的命令，以雷霆万钧之力、秋风扫落叶一般把骑在人民头上的、美帝国主义百般扶植的蒋介石反动武装彻底摧毁了。章乃器所谓“看看政治行情”，就是这样一个对“第三条路线”、“中间势力”极为不利的“行情”，悲观失望之余，只好
  “打打经济算盘”了。
    东北在“八·一五”以后，溥仪在长春“皇宫”中的“宝物”被他的卫士、臣下抢劫以后散失出来，溥仪亲自带着的一部分，也在通化打散了，地主、官僚的收藏也纷纷抛售，章乃器、章伯钧看到这个“行情”，于是就日日出入于古玩铺中，大打其“经济算盘”。
    这些文物被他们以极贱的价格买来带到北京，那时北京古玩行市低落，他们又大肆收购。章乃器急于把这批古物卖到美国，曾经向历史博物馆副馆长韩寿萱打听“行市”，当韩馆长告诉他一个鼎在美国可以卖七、八千美金的时候，章乃器真是大喜若狂。
    可是一个极为使章乃器失望、愤恨、咬牙切齿的事件发生了。当时的华北人民政府鉴于近百年来（尤其是近三十年来）帝国主义者勾结反动统治者和奸商、盗墓匪，把我们祖国文化遗产盗掘、抢劫、破坏、搜刮载运出外国，使我国文物受到损失的严重情况，当即于1949年4月8日颁发了“为禁运古物图书出口令”，这一道法令把中国近百年来的文化遗产所遭到的浩劫制止了。
    解放前我国文物的损失是惨重的。如前绥远省的整个喇嘛庙古建筑、云岗、龙门、天龙山昭陵六骏等著名石刻；西安、洛阳、安阳、长沙等地商、周、战国、汉、唐的墓葬、遗址的出土文物；以及传世的绘画、图书……无不席卷而去，尤其是美帝国主义抢劫更多，而且公然声称：“今后研究中国文化艺术，要到美国来研究了”，“美国拯救了中国艺术品的惨劫”！凡稍具爱国心的人士，对此莫不表示痛恨，这一道法令自然得到了广大人民的拥护和欢呼。但它却遭到帝国主义者、军阀、官僚、奸商、文化汉奸们的仇视。章乃器就是这些人中的一个。他不敢公开提出反对意见，却叫着“换取外汇”的口号，而到处反对这个庄严的法令，我曾记得他多次向各方面散布谰言，攻击这个法令，攻击无效，忍不住又亲笔写了这个“提议”，他公然主张由古玩奸商勾结盗墓匪大开所谓“文化矿”；主张“古代遗物，都不是有历史价值的，都是可以运出换外汇的！”
    他认为国家禁止古物出口，“是不聪明的”，允许近代的没有历史价值的文物出口“是不够的”。他主张把古物都“直接出口”，卖到外国，尤其是美国。他还声明他的“物品”，是不出卖的；但是现在根据揭发，“去年他就把价值一千四百多元的瓷器、铜器共三百多件分三批卖给了古董商人裴顺山”。
    他声明“提议完全和我私人的利害无关”，恰恰相反，正是与他私人利害有极大关系，打破了他黄金美钞的“经济算盘”。因此他才这样肆无忌惮地攻击国家法令。
    这个坚决反对国家禁止文物出口法令，要把祖国文化遗产大肆破坏、盗掘，而且坚决主张卖给美国的章乃器，他的用心和企图不是很明显的吗？
    上面的事实也可以回答这个问题，不用骨头烧成灰，就可看出他是反共反社会主义的。
