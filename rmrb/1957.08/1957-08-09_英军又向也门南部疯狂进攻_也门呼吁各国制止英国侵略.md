Xinhua News Agency, August 8th dispatch from Beirut: The Yemeni Embassy in Lebanon announced that on August 2nd, British troops launched the most cruel and violent attack on the southern region of Yemen since the British invasion of Yemen. British troops attacked the Shukr base and expanded their military operations to areas near Swada, Ma'hash, and Harib. In this attack, British forces used various weapons such as heavy bombs, heavy artillery, and rockets, completely destroying the two villages of Swada and Ma'hash, causing heavy casualties among the residents. The Yemeni Embassy appealed to the people of the world to condemn this British act of aggression.
    However, the British authorities issued a communique in Aden on August 7th to justify their actions. The communique insisted that Yemeni troops had "occupied" the Shukr base in the so-called "Aden Protectorate" and threatened that the British Air Force would "continue to attack until the Yemeni troops withdraw from Shukr." Yemen has repeatedly stated that the so-called "Aden Protectorate" is Yemeni territory occupied by the British.

    英军又向也门南部疯狂进攻
    也门呼吁各国制止英国侵略
    据新华社8日讯　贝鲁特消息：也门驻黎巴嫩公使馆宣布，8月2日英国军队对也门南部地区进行了侵略也门以来最残酷、最凶暴的一次进攻。英国军队进攻了舒克尔基地，并且把军事行动的范围扩大到斯瓦达、迈哈什和哈里布附近地区。在这次进攻中，英军使用了重磅炸弹、重炮、火箭等各种武器，使斯瓦达和迈哈什两个村落完全被毁，居民死伤惨重。也门公使馆吁请全世界人民谴责英国这种侵略行动。
    但是，英国当局8月7日在亚丁发表一项公报为它的行动辩解。公报硬说是也门的部队“侵占了”所谓“亚丁保护地”的舒克尔基地，并且扬言英国空军要“继续攻击，直到也门部队撤离舒克尔为止”。也门已经一再声明，所谓“亚丁保护地”是英国侵占的也门领土。
