Why the "Sudden Rush" to Sell Grain?

Every year, when June arrives, this kind of thing always happens: the grain departments "suddenly rush" to sell grain, and the masses "suddenly rush" to buy grain.

Over the past year, the grain supply in Ji'an County has been relatively normal, ensuring a reasonable supply without any accidents. However, when June arrived, the situation suddenly changed. At that time, the county and township leaders instructed their subordinates, saying: "All those who want to buy grain must buy enough in June in advance. If they wait until July to buy, it will be deducted from next year's supply quota." When the masses heard this news, they panicked and tried to buy back all the grain that had not been purchased on their supply certificates. Some sold their belongings to buy grain; some asked relatives and friends for help or sought government loans to buy grain; some were so anxious that they jumped and cried because they couldn't get the money in time. During this period, thousands upon thousands of people put aside production and carried baskets to buy grain, especially in the last few days of June. Warehouses in Yongyang, Yongchun, and other places were simply overwhelmed, sometimes working until dawn, making the cadres tired and the masses dissatisfied, and errors frequently occurred.

The result of the "sudden rush" to sell grain is that grain sales have greatly increased, and the phenomenon of hoarding grain by the masses is also very common, even encouraging the masses to waste grain. Households with money took the opportunity to buy more grain; some households that originally had enough to eat were also afraid that they would not be supplied in the future and had to buy more grain. It was originally estimated that the county's grain supply was sufficient, and there might be a considerable surplus. What happened in the end? In June, a total of more than 10.25 million jin of rice was sold, more than double the sales in April and May, which had the highest sales volume. Some warehouses did not have enough to sell, so they had to temporarily transfer grain from nearby counties to supply it.

Why the "sudden rush" to sell grain? The reason is that the above stipulates that the unified grain sales are calculated on an annual basis. Sales before June are counted as this year's supply target, and sales after July are counted as next year's supply target. Therefore, "departmentalism" has arisen below. They believe that selling a little more in June will allow the masses to have more grain in their hands, so as to avoid a tight supply next year. If the masses have a better life, it will be easier for the cadres to work. However, they did not consider that the "sudden rush" to sell grain is of no benefit to the country or the masses. In my opinion, doing so will only cause the state to control less grain, make the masses feel anxious, and encourage some people to waste grain.

### 为什么“突击”卖粮？

    为什么“突击”卖粮？
    年年到了6月份，总会出现这样一件事：粮食部门“突击”卖粮，群众“突击”买粮。
    一年来，吉安县的粮食供应是比较正常的，既保证了合理供应，又没有出现什么事故。可是到了6月份，情况突然起了变化。当时，县、乡领导上都往下布置说：“凡是要买粮食的，一律提前在6月份买足，如果等到7月份来买，就要抵下年度的供应数字。”群众听到这个消息，心里着了慌，都去想办法把供应证上没有买完的粮食一起买回去。有的卖掉自己的东西去买粮；有的求亲戚、朋友，或找政府贷款买粮；有的人一时搞不到钱，急得发跳发哭。在这段期间每天有成千成万的群众，丢下生产不搞，挑着箩筐去买粮，特别是在6月底这几天。永阳、永春等仓库，简直忙不开交，有时一直搞到天亮，弄得干部疲劳，群众不满，差错经常发生。
    “突击”卖粮的结果，使得粮食销量大大增加，群众囤粮现象也很普遍，甚至助长群众浪费粮食。有钱的户乘机多买了一些粮食；有的户本来够吃，也害怕将来不供应，不得不多买一些粮食。原来估计，全县粮食足够供应，可能还有不少剩余。结果呢？在6月份一共卖出大米一千零二十五万多斤，比销量最大的4、5月超过了一倍多。有的仓库不够卖，只好临时到附近县调运粮食来供应。
    为什么要“突击”卖粮呢？原因就是上面规定粮食统销按年度计算，6月份以前销售的就算本年度供应指标，7月份以后销售的就算下年度供应指标。因此，下面就产生了“本位主义”，认为在6月份多销一点，让群众手上多有一些粮食，免得下年度供应紧张。群众日子好过，干部工作也好做。可是他们没有考虑到，“突击”卖粮，对国家一无好处，对群众也没好处。我看，这样做，只会使国家少掌握一些粮食，使群众思想紧张，以及促使一部分人浪费粮食。
