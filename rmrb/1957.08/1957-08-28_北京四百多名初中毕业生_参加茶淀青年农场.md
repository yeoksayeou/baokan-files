Xinhua News Agency, 27th. The first group of 450 junior high school graduates from Beijing, who will be participating in agricultural production at the Cha Dian Youth Farm for an extended period, departed at 3 p.m. today. The second group of over 1,000 people will also depart soon.

The teachers, classmates, and parents of these students all came to the train station to see them off today. Before their departure, the schools also held farewell parties for them. The principal of Beijing No. 36 Middle School encouraged the more than 30 young women going to the farm, saying: You must be like pine and cypress, unafraid of wind and frost; you must be like willow trees, able to survive in any environment. Just before this group of students boarded the train, two more students, carrying their luggage, rushed to sign up, firmly requesting to go with them.

The majority of these junior high school graduates are the children of workers and cadres, and some are the children of leading Party and government cadres. Their participation in farm production has received the support and encouragement of their parents.

The Cha Dian Youth Farm has over 400,000 mu of land, and the majority of the 170,000 mu of land that has been cultivated is paddy fields. (Attached photo)

    新华社27日讯　第一批去茶淀青年农场长期参加农业生产的北京市四百五十名初中毕业生，今天下午三时已经出发。第二批一千多人也将在最近出发。
    这些学生的教师、同学和父母今天都到火车站送行。出发前，学校还为他们开了欢送会。市第三十六中学的校长勉励去农场的三十多个年轻姑娘说：你们要像松柏那样不怕风霜，你们要像柳树那样到任何环境都能成活。就在这批学生临上火车前，还有两个学生背着行李赶来报名，坚决要求同去。
    这些初中毕业生绝大部分是工人、干部的子弟，有一些是党政负责干部的子女。他们的参加农场生产都得到了家长的支持和鼓励。
