Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, August 19th: The Suzhou Distillery has successfully experimented with using loquat kernels to brew wine. According to experiments, every hundred jin of fresh loquat kernels can produce fifteen jin of 46-proof white wine, equivalent to the wine yield of thirty jin of barley. After the loquat kernels are used for wine making, the leftover dregs can also be used to feed pigs.

Loquat kernels contain more than 20% starch and are particularly rich in sugar. The wine produced is clear and transparent in color, mellow in taste, and free of bitterness and other off-flavors.

The Dongting Mountain area of Taihu Lake in Zhenze County, Suzhou, is a loquat producing area, with an estimated output of more than 20,000 dan this year.
