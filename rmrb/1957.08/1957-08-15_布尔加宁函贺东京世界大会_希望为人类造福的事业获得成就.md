Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 14th: According to TASS, Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Bulganin wrote a letter on August 8th to the Third World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, congratulating all participants in the conference and wishing them achievements in the noble cause of benefiting all mankind.

In his letter, Bulganin said that people of all countries firmly demand that governments of all countries possessing atomic weapons undertake the solemn obligation not to use such weapons and not to continue testing such weapons. Prohibiting the use of atomic weapons and stopping their testing would undoubtedly create favorable conditions for resolving all disarmament issues and would help eliminate the threat of a devastating atomic war.

Bulganin said that the Soviet Union has consistently pursued a policy of peace and has consistently advocated the complete prohibition of the production and use of atomic weapons, both in the past and at present. The Soviet Union has repeatedly made proposals to the United Nations on this issue. The Soviet government proposed first stopping the testing of atomic weapons in order to prevent the further development of atomic weapons. If Western countries do not currently agree with the proposal to completely and thoroughly ban testing, then the Soviet government is also willing to conclude an agreement to suspend atomic weapons testing for two or three years. However, the Soviet government's proposal has not been supported by Western countries.

Bulganin expressed the hope that the Third World Conference in Tokyo will reflect the desire of people of all countries to establish lasting peace and make a contribution to the active resolution of this pressing issue.

    布尔加宁函贺东京世界大会
    希望为人类造福的事业获得成就
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁在8月8日写信给第三届禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会，祝贺大会的全体参加者在为全人类造福的崇高事业中获得成就。
    布尔加宁在信中说：世界各国人民坚决要求拥有原子武器的各国政府承担不使用这类武器和不再继续进行这种武器的试验的庄严义务。禁止使用原子武器和停止它的试验，毫无疑问，会对解决所有的裁军问题创造有利条件，并且有助于消除发生毁灭性原子战争的威胁。
    布尔加宁说，苏联始终不渝地奉行和平政策，过去和现在一贯主张完全禁止生产和使用原子武器。苏联曾经不止一次地就这一问题向联合国提出建议。苏联政府建议首先停止原子武器的试验，以阻止原子武器的进一步发展。如果西方国家目前不赞成完全彻底禁止试验的建议，那么，苏联政府还愿意缔结暂停试验原子武器两三年的协定。但是苏联政府的建议没有得到西方国家的支持。
    布尔加宁表示，希望在东京举行的第三届世界大会能够反映各国人民要求树立持久和平的愿望，对积极解决这一迫切问题作出贡献。
