On the Anti-Rightist Front

    Inciting Religious Followers Against the Communist Party Fails; Minister Reveals True Colors Under His Clerical Garb

    "Those without God (referring to the Communist Party) should not govern those with God (referring to religious followers)." This is a poisoned arrow shot at the Party by Yu Peicang, a rightist element from Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, and a minister of the Zhengzhou City Chinese Anglican Church.

    This rightist element, cloaked in religious garb, has consistently slandered and denigrated the policies of the Communist Party, attempting to incite religious followers against the People's Government. He compared religious followers to "quails," saying that the People's Government "has squeezed the 'quails' until they can barely breathe." This rightist element also colluded everywhere, organizing others to attack the Communist Party. Now, exposed by the religious followers, this rightist element has revealed his true colors.

  　Yu Shan Compiles the "Essence" of Rightist Opinions from the Press, Proposing Four Vicious Suggestions

    Yu Shan (a Communist Party member), from the Hebei Daily supplement department, in order to abolish the Party's leadership over the newspaper and change its political direction, compiled the "essence" of some reactionary opinions from rightist elements in the national press, and proposed four vicious "suggestions": advocating running the newspaper according to the cooperative model, distributing income based on work points; leaders of the newspaper's editorial departments should be elected; abolishing the eight-hour work system, editors should complete a fixed quota of tasks with quality and quantity, and the rest of the time should be at their free disposal; running two newspapers in the province to "sing opposing tunes."

    Unveiling the Secrets of "Tongren Evening News"

    The Chongqing Daily held seven meetings of various sizes, exposing a rightist clique centered on reporter You Zhongwen from the editorial education group, editor Yang Benquan from the culture group, and reporter Cao Yuelin from the finance group.

    This group of rightist elements, on the one hand, used various "voicing opinions" forums to wildly attack the Communist Party's newspaper running line, and on the other hand, secretly planned to run "Tongren Evening News," preparing to use this "evening news" to inherit the bourgeoisie's tradition of running newspapers, and strengthen "citizen reports" and reports of so-called social news such as car accidents, fires, murder and arson. They secretly discussed having Cao Yuelin publicly propose the suggestion of running "Tongren Evening News" at a forum held by the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China for the cultural, artistic, news, and publishing circles. At the same time, You Zhongwen sent a special telegram to Wenhui Daily, attempting to use Wenhui Daily's support to exert pressure on the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. They also recruited personnel everywhere and planned to pull in a Communist Party member as editor-in-chief as window dressing; they also planned to hire Liu Shengya, a rightist backbone figure in Chongqing's literary and art circles, to write novels, and Wang Zimei to draw cartoons.

　　在反右派战线上
    煽动教徒反共未逞牧师外衣下面现出原形
    “无神的人（指共产党）不应该管有神的人（指信神的教徒）”。这是河南省郑州市的右派分子、郑州市中华圣公会牧师于沛苍，向党射出的一枝毒箭。
    这个披着宗教外衣的右派分子，一贯污蔑诋毁共产党的政策，企图煽动教徒反对人民政府。他把教徒比做“鹌鹑”，说人民政府“已经将‘鹌鹑’捏得喘不过气来”。这个右派分子还到处串连组织别人向共产党进攻。现在，这个右派分子在教徒们的揭露下，现出了原形。

  　集新闻界右派言论的“精华”于山提出四项恶毒建议
    河北日报副刊部于山（共产党员），为了取消党对报纸的领导，改变报纸的政治方向，集全国新闻界右派分子的一些反动言论的“精华”，提出了恶毒的“四项建议”：主张办报照合作社的办法，按工分分配收入；报纸编辑部门的领导干部由选举产生；取消八小时工作制，编辑按质按量完成定额任务后，其余的时间自由支配；在全省办两个报纸唱对台戏。

    揭开“同人晚报”的秘密
    重庆日报举行过七次大小会议，揭露了以编辑部教育组记者游仲文、文化组编辑杨本泉、财经组记者曹岳霖人等为核心的右派小集团。
    这批右派分子一面利用各种“鸣、放”座谈会，大肆攻击共产党的办报路线，一面秘密地筹办“同人晚报”，准备用这张“晚报”来继承资产阶级的办报传统，加强“市民报道”和车祸、火警、杀人放火等一类的所谓社会新闻的报道。他们密商好由曹岳霖在中共重庆市委召开的文化、艺术、新闻、出版界座谈会上公开提出办“同人晚报”的建议，同时由游仲文向文汇报发专电，企图利用文汇报的支持，对中共重庆市委施加压力。他们还到处招兵买马，并打算拉一个共产党员任总编辑，作为装点；还计划聘请重庆文艺界的右派骨干分子刘盛亚写小说，汪子美画漫画。
