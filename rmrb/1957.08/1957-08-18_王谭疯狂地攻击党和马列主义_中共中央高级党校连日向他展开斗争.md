    Wang Tan Frantically Attacks the Party and Marxism-Leninism: The Central Party School of the CCP Launches Days of Struggle Against Him
    (Our Newspaper News) In the struggle against the rightists, the Central Party School of the CCP has, in recent days, exposed and vehemently denounced the counter-revolutionary face of Wang Tan, a student in the school's general class, former acting deputy editor-in-chief of the Guangxi Daily, and a rightist element within the Party, for opposing the Party and the Central Committee.
    This "old Communist Party member" with twenty years of Party membership systematically distorted and viciously attacked the Party's history, its line, and the life within the Party. As early as July 1956, in his entrance examination paper "Reflections on Studying 'On the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat,'" he maliciously distorted the history and line of the Party, attempting to negate the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong since the Zunyi Conference. During the early stages of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Comrade Wang Ming committed right-leaning opportunist errors, which were quickly discovered and criticized by the Party Central Committee. However, Wang Tan fabricated accusations, falsely claiming that the Party Central Committee also made similar errors. Wang Tan was so egregious as to fabricate facts, attempting to place the responsibility for Wang Ming's errors at that time on the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong.
    Wang Tan also went to great lengths to slander the correct handling of the Gao Gang-Rao Shushi anti-Party alliance, attempting to negate the correct decision of the Central Committee to crush the Gao-Rao anti-Party alliance and maintain unity within the Party.
    In January of this year, at the conclusion of philosophy studies during a summary of thoughts, he once again used the title "A Kind of Affection to Be Achieved" to wantonly vent his dissatisfaction with the Party and the Central Committee, continuing his frantic attacks on the Party from the aspects of the Party's democratic centralism, the principle of criticism and self-criticism within the Party, and the life within the Party. He demanded, with extreme error, that Party members should "cultivate a political quality of daring to 'criticize superiors,'" daring to "move the earth over the 'Grand Duke'." He complacently said that after studying philosophy and the "Eighth National Congress" documents, he had "initially mustered the spirit of bold and equal rights criticism." What kind of "equal rights" was he demanding? During his studies, he constantly disseminated serious antagonistic emotions towards the Party Central Committee and Party organizations, disregarding the democratic centralism of Party life, and demanding "absolute freedom." During the branch election, he advocated not nominating candidates, arguing that would be "true democracy" and "free voting."
    In this article, Wang Tan also put forward "Ten Key Points for Criticism" as a programmatic opinion for his transformation of the Party. According to his opinion, the spearhead of criticism should be directed at the highest leadership of the Party. Here, Wang Tan once again used all sorts of malicious words to attack the Party, saying that within the Party there were everywhere "people who presumptuously engage in revisionism and dogmatism towards Marxism-Leninism," "people who harbor a 'hypocritical style' and a 'Cao Cao style'," "people who are self-centered and autocratic and 'willing to be dictators'," and "people with 'Ah Q spirit'," and so on.
    The bourgeois rightists launched a rampant attack on the Party, which was exactly what Wang Tan had in mind. He believed that the rightist elements such as Lin Xiling and others attacking the Party could not be blamed on themselves, but should be attributed to the Party's insufficient education of them. He also shamelessly said: these rightist elements "perhaps tens of thousands of years later will become fragrant flowers."
    Wang Tan's reactionary words and deeds were sternly refuted by the students of the Senior Party School. Everyone angrily pointed out: Wang Tan is the vanguard of the bourgeois rightists' attack on our Party and a traitor to the Communist Party.
    Wang Tan came from a landlord family and received a bourgeois higher education. During his tenure as the Director of the Guangxi Provincial Foreign Affairs Office, because his leadership in the "Three-Anti" movement was weak and ineffective, the organization ordered him to suspend his duties for self-reflection; and because his work performance was not good and he was not suitable for foreign affairs work, the organization transferred his work in 1955. Since then, Wang Tan harbored resentment against the Party, his bourgeois individualist thinking developed to the extreme, merged with the revisionist trend of thought in the international communist movement, and eventually embarked on the road of betraying the Party.

    王谭疯狂地攻击党和马列主义
    中共中央高级党校连日向他展开斗争
    本报讯  中共中央高级党校在反右派斗争中，连日来揭发并痛斥了该校普通班学员、前广西日报代副总编辑、党内右派分子王谭的反党、反中央的反动面目。
    这个有二十年党龄的“老共产党员”，对党的历史、党的路线、党的生活，进行了有系统的歪曲和恶毒的攻击。早在1956年7月王谭写的入学考试论文“学习‘关于无产阶级专政的历史经验’的心得”中，他恶毒地歪曲了党的历史和路线，企图否定自从遵义会议以来以毛泽东同志为首的党中央的正确领导。在抗日战争初期，王明同志犯的右倾机会主义错误，很快就为党中央发觉和批判，而王谭却无中生有地污蔑党中央也犯有同样的错误。王谭恶劣到捏造事实，妄图把当时王明所犯错误的责任强加在以毛泽东同志为首的党中央领导身上。
    对于高岗、饶漱石反党联盟的正确处理，王谭也极尽污蔑之能事，企图否定中央粉碎高饶反党联盟、维护党内团结的正确决定。
    今年1月，学习哲学结束进行思想总结时，他又以“要做到的一种爱戴”为题，肆无忌惮地发泄了他对党和中央的不满，继续从党的民主集中制、党内批评和自我批评的原则以及党的生活等方面，向党进行了疯狂的攻击。他极端错误地要求党员应该“炼得出这一种‘评上’的政治品质来”，敢于在“太岁”头上动土。他并沾沾自喜地说，他经过哲学和“八大”文件的学习，“初步鼓起了大胆和平权的批评精神”。他要求的是怎样一种“平权”呢？他在学习期间，不断散布对党中央和党组织的严重对抗情绪，无视党内生活的民主集中制，要求“绝对的自由”。支部改选时，他主张不提候选人，认为那样才是“真正民主”，是“自由投票”。
    在这篇文章中，王谭还提出了“十条批评提要”，作为他改造党的纲领性的意见。按照他的意见，批评的矛头，应指向党的最高领导。在这里，王谭再次用了一切恶毒的词句，对党进行攻击，说什么党内到处都是“对马列主义妄作修正主义和教条主义的活动的人们”，“抱有‘伪君子之风’，和‘阿瞒之风’的人们”，“唯我独尊自专和‘甘作独夫’的人们”以及“有‘阿Q气’的人们”，等等。
    资产阶级右派向党发动猖狂的进攻，正中王谭的心怀。他认为林希翎等右派分子向党进攻，不能怨他们本人，而要归咎于党对他们教育不够。他还无耻地说：这些右派分子“也许几万年后会成为香花吧”。
    王谭的反动言行，受到了高级党校同学们的严正驳斥。大家愤怒地指出：王谭是资产阶级右派进攻我们党的急先锋，是共产党的叛徒。
    王谭出身于地主家庭，曾受过资产阶级的高等教育。在他任广西省外事处处长期间，因为领导“三反”运动软弱无力，组织上曾责令他停职反省；又由于他工作表现不好，不适于做外事工作，组织上在1955年调动了他的工作。王谭从此对党怀恨在心，资产阶级个人主义思想发展到登峰造极，同国际共产主义运动中的修正主义思潮合流，以至于最后走上了背叛党的绝路。
