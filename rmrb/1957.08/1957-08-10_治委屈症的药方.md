    Prescription for Treating the "Feeling Wronged" Syndrome
    Wu Lü
    Not long ago, when discussing with some enterprise cadres the opinions of the masses on resolving housing issues, everyone felt a subtle sense of grievance: quite a few worker dormitories have been built in recent years, but they are still accused of being bureaucratic and not caring about the well-being of the masses. Isn't this very unfair?
    This grievance has its reasons, but it's not deserving of sympathy. It has its reasons because the state has indeed spent a lot of money and built a lot of worker dormitories in recent years. Although the housing problems of some workers have not been well resolved, this is due to the limitations of the state's financial resources, and not because the enterprise leaders don't care about the well-being of the masses. Accusing them of being bureaucratic is not entirely fair. It is not deserving of sympathy because, although the enterprise has put in a lot of effort in this regard, it is not understood by the masses, which still points to shortcomings in their own work, and they cannot completely blame others.
    In many enterprises, the construction of worker dormitories is often decided after a discussion among a few leading cadres. After completion, the allocation is still reviewed and distributed by a few leading cadres based on the applications of the workers. This practice of making decisions by a few cadres without consulting the masses has at least two major drawbacks: First, the masses do not know how much work the enterprise has already done to improve worker housing, what work is planned to be done, and what difficulties exist. Therefore, when their application for housing cannot be resolved, it is easy to negate the overall effort with a single point, and label the leaders with accusations such as "not caring about the well-being of the masses" and "bureaucratic." Second, worker dormitories are originally built for the masses. Without consulting the masses, it is easy to turn a good thing into a bad one. For example, the construction standards of worker dormitories in some enterprises are too high. If they don't build, they don't build; but if they do, they build high-rise buildings. Each unit has two rooms, with an attached kitchen and bathroom, as well as heating equipment. It is comfortable, but many workers cannot afford to live in them. More workers question: "Spending so much money only solves the problems of a few people. Why not lower the standards and build more houses with the same amount of money?"
    Consulting with the masses and following the mass line in everything is a well-known principle. Why are these principles often not adopted for things like building worker dormitories, which are closely related to the vital interests of the masses? It is said that it is precisely because these things are too closely related to the vital interests of the masses that entrusting them to the masses for discussion will inevitably lead to varied opinions and make it difficult to reach a conclusion. If the masses raise excessive demands, it will be even more difficult to handle.
    "Too many people, too many opinions." This concern seems to make some sense, but it is actually a manifestation of a weak mass perspective. Not long ago, Daye Steel Plant handed the "Draft Plan for Annual Living Welfare Measures" to the worker representatives' meeting and mobilized all the workers in the plant to discuss it. As a result, instead of being "difficult to handle," they gained what might be an unexpected harvest for some comrades. The draft plan stipulated that more multi-story buildings should be built for worker dormitories, but the masses proposed to build bungalows instead; the draft plan stipulated the construction of kindergartens, nurseries, etc., but the masses believed that these were not urgent priorities in the plant at present and could be postponed; the draft plan stipulated the purchase of trucks to haul garbage, but the masses believed that manual labor could be used instead.
    It can be seen that the masses understand the principles of "building the country diligently and thriftily" and "spending less money and doing more things" no less than the leading cadres. Handing over the measures and plans for improving the living welfare of workers to the masses for discussion not only allows the masses to understand what the leadership has done and what they are planning to do, eliminating the estrangement in this regard, but also generates many good ideas. This is the masses giving the leadership a lesson. Of course, the masses will also make excessive demands, which requires the leadership to give the masses a lesson, talk about the situation, and explain the reasons. Some workers in Daye Steel Plant also had some excessive demands at the beginning, but after discussion, they improved their understanding and withdrew them.
    The method of Daye Steel Plant is worth learning. It is recommended that those enterprise cadres who have done a lot of work to improve the lives of workers, but have not yet been understood by the masses and therefore feel wronged, try this prescription.

    治委屈症的药方
    吴滤
    不久以前，同一些企业干部谈起群众对解决宿舍问题的意见，大家都隐隐有委屈之感：几年来职工宿舍盖了不少，但还不免被指责为不关心群众疾苦的官僚主义者，岂不是很委屈吗？
    这委屈有道理，却不可同情。有道理，是因为几年来国家确实出了不少钱，盖了不少职工宿舍，虽然还有些职工的宿舍问题没有很好解决，这是受国家财力所限，而并不是企业领导干部不关心群众疾苦。责之为官僚主义，是不够公平的。又不可同情，是因为企业在这方面虽然出了许多力，但不能为群众所谅解，总还是自己工作上的缺点，不能完全怨人。
    有不少企业，建设职工宿舍，往往是几个领导干部一商量就决定了。建成之后，也还是几个领导干部根据职工的申请审查分配一下。这种由少数干部决定而不同群众商量的做法，至少有两大流弊：一是群众不知道企业在改善职工住宅方面已经做了多少工作，还准备做些什么工作，有些什么困难，因而一遇到自己申请房子不能得到解决，就很容易以一点否定全面，把“不关心群众疾苦”、“官僚主义”等帽子往领导头上扣。二是职工宿舍原是替群众盖的，不同群众商量，容易把好事办坏。例如有些企业职工宿舍的建筑标准过高，不盖则已，要盖就是大楼。两间一个单元，附带厨房、卫生间各一，还有暖气设备。舒服倒是舒服，可是许多职工住不起。更多的职工责问道：“花这么多钱只解决了少数人的问题，为什么不降低些标准，用同样的钱盖更多的房子呢？”
    遇事同群众商量，走群众路线，这是人所共知的道理。为什么修建职工宿舍这类同群众切身利益密切相关的事情却常常不采用这些原则呢？据说正是因为这类事情同群众的切身利益关系太大，交给群众讨论，必然意见纷纷，难下结论，若是群众提出过高要求，更不好收拾。
    “人多口杂”，这顾虑像是有些道理，实际上还是群众观点不强的表现。不久以前，大冶钢厂把“全年生活福利措施计划草案”交给职工代表会，发动全厂职工讨论。结果非但没有“不好收拾”，反而得到对某些同志说来也许是意外的收获。草案规定职工宿舍多盖楼房，群众提出改建平房；草案规定建造幼儿园、托儿所等，群众认为目前在本厂这些还不是当务之急，可以暂缓；草案规定购置汽车拖垃圾，群众认为可以用人工代替。
    可见群众对于“勤俭建国”、“少花钱、多办事”的方针，领会得不比领导干部差。把改善职工生活福利的措施计划交给群众讨论，不但使群众了解领导上做了些什么、还准备做些什么，消除了这方面的隔膜，而且出了许多好主意。这是群众给领导上了一课。当然，群众也会提出过高的要求，这就需要领导给群众上上课，谈谈情况，讲讲道理。大冶钢厂有些职工开始也有些过高要求，经过讨论，提高了认识，也就撤回去了。
    大冶钢厂的这个办法很值得学习。建议那些在改善职工生活方面做了许多工作，尚不能被群众谅解，因而感到委屈的企业干部，试试这张药方。
