　　Shaanxi Industrial and Mining Enterprises Begin Rectification Campaign
    (Our newspaper dispatch) Xi'an, Shaanxi Daily news: The rectification movement has unfolded in fifty-five key factories, mines, and enterprises across Shaanxi Province. Most of the 12,000 cadres participating in the rectification have spoken. Each unit has put forward hundreds or even thousands of criticisms and suggestions.

    The majority of these opinions criticize bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism within their respective units' leadership. Many opinions also raise questions concerning the Party's guidelines, policies, and the nation's systems. Classified by the nature of the opinions, they can be broadly divided into aspects like living welfare, wages and benefits, cadre promotion, leadership style, Party building, and enterprise management. Some people have also expressed their views on issues such as the Party's leadership in enterprises, agricultural collectivization, the state monopoly of purchase and supply, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and the people's livelihood.

    Most of the correct criticisms and suggestions put forward by cadres have been promptly addressed. Explanations have been provided for problems that cannot be resolved immediately. Of the 2,952 opinions raised by eleven units in the Xi'an railway system, 784 have already been resolved. The state-owned Northwest No. 4 Cotton Textile Mill has established a special research group. The canteen problem, which has received the most complaints from the masses and has remained unresolved for a long time, has had dedicated personnel assigned to assist in resolving it. The housing allocation plan has also been revised and will soon be submitted to the masses for discussion. The Xinxi Northwest Printing and Dyeing Factory showed a little more favor to a few section chiefs when allocating family housing. They also accepted the criticism from the masses this time and had two section chiefs return their extra houses.

    Currently, some unit leaders still harbor right-leaning conservative ideas, believing that they have released enough opinions. Some believe that their units are small and won't produce any significant issues, even though the masses still have many opinions they haven't expressed, but the leaders want to end the campaign early. There are also units that haven't handled the opinions of the masses promptly enough, which has affected the enthusiasm of the masses to continue offering opinions.

　　陕西工矿企业开始整风
    本报讯　陕西日报消息：陕西全省五十五个重要工厂、矿山、企业单位展开了整风运动。参加整风的一万二千名干部，大部分都发了言。各单位都提出了几百条上千条的批评和意见。
    这些意见大部分是批评本单位领导上的官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义，其中也有不少意见是就党的方针、政策和国家的制度等方面提出问题的。按提出意见的性质，大致可以分为生活福利、工资待遇、干部提拔、领导作风、建党及企业管理等几个方面，也有一些人就党在企业中的领导、农业合作化、统购统销、肃反运动和人民的生活等问题提出了自己的看法。
    各单位对干部提出的正确的批评和意见，大都及时地改进了；对一时不能解决的问题，也都作了说明和解释。西安铁路系统的十一个单位提出的二千九百五十二条意见，已解决了七百八十四条。国营西北第四棉纺织厂成立了专门研究小组。对群众意见最多，长期未能很好解决的食堂问题，已抽出专人协助解决；住房分配方案也作了修改，不久即交群众讨论。新西北印染厂在分配家属住房时，对少数科长照顾得多了一点。这次也接受群众批评，让两个科长把多余的房子让了出来。
    目前有些单位的领导仍然存在着右倾保守思想，认为放得差不多了；有的认为自己单位小，鸣放不出什么问题，本来群众还有很多意见没有讲出来，领导上却想早日收场。还有些单位对群众提出的意见，处理不够及时，影响了群众继续提意见的积极性。
