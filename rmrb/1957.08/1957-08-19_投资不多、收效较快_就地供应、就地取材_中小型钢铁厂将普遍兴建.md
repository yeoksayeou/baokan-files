    Small and Medium-Sized Steel Plants Will Be Widely Built

    (Our dispatch) The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry will vigorously assist in the development of local metallurgical industries, and a plan has been determined to first build eighteen small and medium-sized steel plants in eighteen provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities.

    The plan stipulates that: Hebei and Shandong provinces will each build a steel plant with an annual output of 350,000 tons of pig iron and 300,000 tons of steel; Shanxi, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Hubei, Guangxi, and Sichuan provinces will each build a steel plant with an annual output of 150,000 tons of pig iron (200,000 tons in Guangxi) and 100,000 tons of steel; Henan, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, and Gansu provinces will each build a steel plant with an annual output of 100,000 tons of pig iron and 50,000 to 80,000 tons of steel; the steel plant in Zhejiang will be expanded on the basis of the Hangzhou Iron Smelting Plant currently under construction; Hunan, Guizhou provinces and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region will each build a steel plant with an annual output of 60,000 tons of pig iron and 40,000 to 50,000 tons of steel; the steel plant in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region will be expanded on the basis of the original August 1st Steel Plant; Guangdong will build a steel plant with an annual output of 140,000 tons of pig iron and 50,000 tons of steel; Beijing will build an alloy steel plant with an annual output of 50,000 tons of steel.

    The construction of these small and medium-sized steel plants will better coordinate with the production of large-scale steel plants to meet the needs of various construction undertakings in various regions for steel.

    At present, more than 70% of China's steel production is concentrated in a few areas such as the Northeast, while the various steel raw materials needed in various regions, sometimes in small quantities, have to be transported from the Northeast and other places. In addition, user departments require many varieties and specifications, but the quantities are small, which is not suitable for the mass production of large factories. After these small and medium-sized factories are built, they can produce according to the actual needs of various regions, greatly reducing this contradiction.

    The construction of these small and medium-sized steel plants is in line with the construction policy of "small investment, quick results." A large-scale steel plant with an annual output of 1.5 million tons of steel requires an investment of more than one billion yuan; the construction time, excluding geological exploration time, takes eight or nine years from design to completion, and even partial production takes five or six years. Small factories are different. The total investment in these eighteen small and medium-sized steel plants is only 600 to 700 million yuan. Construction will begin in 1958, and they will be put into production successively from 1960 to 1961, and will be generally completed by 1962. By then, the annual increase in pig iron production will be 2.4 to 2.5 million tons, steel 1.6 to 1.7 million tons, and steel products 1.1 to 1.2 million tons.

    In addition, the construction of these small and medium-sized steel plants can make better use of national resources. Generally, large-scale steel plants often need to be built in places with more than 100 million to 150 million tons of ore resources, while small and medium-sized plants are not subject to this restriction, and they can determine the scale of the plant according to the amount of resources. Since small and medium-sized steel plants do not require a high degree of mechanization and automation, they can accommodate more workers to participate in production.

    At present, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and relevant provinces and cities are carrying out busy preparations. The expansion of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Steel Plant and the construction of steel plants in Shanxi, Zhejiang, Hunan, and Guangdong have already started this year. It is expected that the construction of small and medium-sized steel plants in Sichuan, Jiangsu, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Fujian will start next year. Other factories will carry out preparatory work next year.

### 投资不多、收效较快  就地供应、就地取材  中小型钢铁厂将普遍兴建

    投资不多、收效较快  就地供应、就地取材
    中小型钢铁厂将普遍兴建
    本报讯　冶金工业部将大力协助发展地方性的冶金工业，目前已确定了先在十八个省、自治区和市建设十八个中小型钢铁厂的方案。
    这个方案中拟定：在河北、山东两省各建设一个年产生铁三十五万吨和钢三十万吨的钢铁厂；在山西、江西、江苏、湖北、广西、四川等省各建设一个年产生铁十五万吨（广西的年产二十万吨）和钢十万吨的钢铁厂；在河南、浙江、安徽、福建、甘肃等省各建设一个年产生铁十万吨和钢五到八万吨的钢铁厂，浙江的钢铁厂将根据正在建设中的杭县炼铁厂扩建；在湖南、贵州两省和新疆维吾尔自治区各建设一个年产生铁六万吨和钢四到五万吨的钢铁厂，新疆维吾尔自治区的钢铁厂将根据原八一钢厂扩建；在广东建设一个年产生铁十四万吨和钢五万吨的钢铁厂；在北京市建设一个年产五万吨钢的合金钢厂。
    这些中小型钢铁厂的建设，将会更好地配合大型钢铁厂的生产，来满足各地各项建设事业中对钢铁的需要。
    目前，我国的钢铁生产有70％以上集中在东北等少数地区，而各地需要的各种钢铁原料材料，有时数量很少，也得远从东北等地调运。另外，使用部门要求品种规格很多，但数量很少，不适应大厂的大批生产。在这批中小型厂建成以后，就可以根据各地实际需要进行生产，大大减少这种矛盾现象。
    这些中小型钢铁厂的建设符合“投资少、收效快”的建设方针。一个年产一百五十万吨钢的大型钢铁厂，投资需要十几亿元；建厂时间除地质勘探时间以外，从设计到建成需要八、九年之久，即使部分投入生产也得五、六年的时间。小厂则不同。这十八个中小型钢铁厂，投资总数只要六至七亿元，从1958年施工到1960—1961年就可以陆续投入生产，1962年大体可以全部完成。到那时候，每年就能增产生铁二百四十到二百五十万吨，钢一百六十到一百七十万吨，钢材一百一十到一百二十万吨。
    此外，建设这些中小型的钢铁厂还可以使国家资源得到更好的利用。一般大型钢铁厂，往往需要在具有一亿至一亿五千万吨以上的矿石资源的地方才可以兴建，而中小型厂则不受这个限制，它可以根据资源的多少确定建厂规模。由于中小型钢铁厂对机械化自动化程度要求不高，就可以容纳更多的工人参加生产。
    目前，冶金工业部和各有关省市正在进行繁忙的准备工作，新疆维吾尔自治区钢铁厂扩建和山西、浙江、湖南、广东钢铁厂的建厂工程今年已经动工。预计明年可以动工的将有四川、江苏、湖北、江西、福建等中小型钢铁厂的工程。其他各厂明年都将进行筹备工作。
