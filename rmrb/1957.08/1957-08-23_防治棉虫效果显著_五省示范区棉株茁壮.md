　　(Our report) The more than one million mu of cotton fields in the large-scale cotton bollworm prevention and production demonstration zones in Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, and Shaanxi provinces are generally growing well.

　　This year, in the demonstration zone's cotton fields, there have been new situations where large areas of contiguous cotton fields, encompassing one to two hundred thousand mu, have not suffered from pest damage, leaf curling, or leaf drop. The budding, flowering, and boll-forming periods in the demonstration zone's cotton fields are also about half a month earlier than in previous years. Due to the timely elimination of pests, it is estimated that the cotton yield per unit area here this year will be 20 to 30 percent higher than in the bumper year of 1955.

　  防治棉虫效果显著
　  五省示范区棉株茁壮
    本报讯　河南、河北、山东、山西、陕西五省大面积防治棉虫保产示范区的一百多万亩棉田生长普遍良好。
    示范区的棉田中今年出现了一、二十万亩的大面积连片棉田没有因虫害、卷叶、落叶的新情况。示范区的棉田现蕾、开花、结铃时期也比往年提早半个月左右。由于及时消灭了虫害，今年这里的棉花单位面积产量预计可比丰收的1955年高二、三成。
