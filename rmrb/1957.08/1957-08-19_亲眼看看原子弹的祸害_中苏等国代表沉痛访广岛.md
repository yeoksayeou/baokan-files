    Witnessing the Devastation of the Atomic Bomb
    Representatives from China, the Soviet Union, and Other Countries Visited Hiroshima in Grief
    Xinhua News Agency, Hiroshima, August 18th: Following the conclusion of the Third World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament, representatives from nine countries, including China, the Soviet Union, Mongolia, Australia, and Egypt, traveled by car to Hiroshima this morning to visit the site that had suffered the massacre of the American atomic bomb.
    The delegations were invited to attend a welcoming banquet hosted by Hiroshima Mayor Tadao Watanabe at noon. Watanabe said in his speech at the banquet that we believe that the representatives of various countries, after personally seeing the actual situation of Hiroshima's suffering, will help promote the movement to ban nuclear weapons worldwide.
    Australian representative Morrow, on behalf of the delegations, expressed his thanks and said that this visit will be of great help to our movement to ban nuclear weapons and eliminate war from the world. Morrow believes that as long as the people of the world remember the painful lessons of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and unanimously issue a common call for the prohibition of nuclear weapons, our struggle will surely be victorious.
    Members of the Hiroshima Prefectural Assembly and business representatives held a special symposium with the Chinese delegation. At the meeting, Araki Takeshi, a member of the Hiroshima Prefectural Assembly and representative of the Hiroshima-China Friendship Association, handed over the list of twenty-six overseas Chinese who died in Hiroshima (five of whom died in the atomic bomb) to the Chinese delegation, and expressed his intention to hold a memorial service for the deceased and send the remains of the overseas Chinese back to China.

    亲眼看看原子弹的祸害
    中苏等国代表沉痛访广岛
    据新华社广岛18日电　中国、苏联、蒙古、澳大利亚和埃及等九个国家的代表们，在第三届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会结束以后，今天上午乘车到曾经遭受美国原子弹屠杀的广岛进行参观访问。
    各国代表团当天中午应邀出席了广岛市长渡边忠雄的欢迎宴会。渡边在宴会上致词说，我们相信，各国代表亲眼看了广岛受害的实际情况，将有助于在全世界范围内推进禁止核武器的运动。
    澳大利亚代表莫罗代表各国代表团致谢后说，这次参观对于我们进行禁止核武器和从世界上消除战争的运动有很大的作用。莫罗认为，只要全世界人民记取广岛、长崎被炸的惨痛教训，并且一致发出禁止核武器的共同呼声，那么，我们的斗争一定会获得胜利。
    广岛县议会议员和工商界人士特别同中国代表团举行了座谈会。会上，广岛县议会议员、广岛日中友好协会代表荒木武把在广岛死亡的二十六名华侨名单（其中五名死于原子弹）交给了中国代表团，并且表示要为死者举行慰灵祭和把华侨遗骨送回中国。
