    China Political Science and Law Society and Other Units
    Critique Lou Bangyan's Reactionary Words and Deeds
    (Our newspaper report) The China Political Science and Law Society, the Beijing Branch of the Jiusan Society, and the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Justice have recently held meetings for several consecutive days to expose and criticize the anti-Party words and deeds of Lou Bangyan, a vanguard rightist in political and legal circles.
    At the beginning of the rectification campaign, Lou Bangyan, Deputy Director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Justice, launched a frenzied attack on the Party. He opposed the "gentle breeze and mild rain" approach to rectification, saying, "Gentle breeze and mild rain is for you Party members, non-Party cadres are not subject to this restriction," and "If the masses have opinions, they can speak out on the street." When the Party group of the Bureau of Justice was actively holding discussion meetings to solicit opinions from non-Party cadres on the Party, Lou Bangyan said, "There is no rectification atmosphere in the building (referring to the Bureau of Justice and the higher and intermediate people's courts)," and "There are unspeakable secrets in the building, the lid has not been lifted." He also said that the law of this rectification is: "The Party group is not as good as ordinary Party members, Party members are not as good as League members, League members are not as good as the masses, and the Communist Party is not as good as democratic parties." Therefore, "The masses should exert pressure on the Party." He greatly praised the reactionary words and deeds of the rightists at Peking University in attacking the Party, and incited cadres who graduated from Peking University, saying: "You should go back (referring to Peking University) and see, the younger brothers are much more advanced than you elder brothers!" Under Lou Bangyan's repeated instigation, rightists Chen Jianguo, Zhao Weihou, Guo Kehong, and others continuously posted big-character posters slandering the Party. When the rightists' big-character posters were counterattacked, Lou Bangyan immediately shouted that Chen Jianguo was being "besieged," told Chen Jianguo to "remain calm," and urged them to appeal at the China Political Science and Law Society's discussion meeting. They also jointly studied the main points of their speeches to slander the Party.
    Cadres Zhu Jintao and others from the Bureau of Justice revealed that shortly after the start of the rectification campaign, Lou Bangyan immediately wooed some intellectuals who had been struggled against in the anti-Rightist movement and harbored resentment against the Party, and frequently held secret talks. He convened discussion meetings in his personal capacity to collect anti-Party materials. He also requested to participate in the Bureau of Justice's rectification leadership group to collect the Party's shortcomings and mistakes.
    Lou Bangyan also set fire at the Beijing University of Political Science and Law's discussion meeting, slandering the Party's transformation of old intellectuals in the political and legal circles as "striking them down with one blow," in order to provoke a rift between the Party and the old teachers. At the non-Party bureau chiefs' symposium convened by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, he fabricated rumors, saying, "Intellectuals are not valued in government offices. Those who were rectified in the anti-Rightist movement were all intellectuals, and they were all rectified wrongly." Lou Bangyan is a vanguard of the right-wing schemer Qian Duansheng's small clique in political and legal circles, and his reactionary words and deeds echoed Qian Duansheng's. He believed that the Party's leadership over political and legal education and judicial work was too much, and that he, as the deputy director, was "in position but without power." He said that factionalism was serious in political and legal circles from top to bottom, and that more non-Party personnel should be absorbed into leadership positions in political and legal circles. He also conspired with Qian Duansheng to plan "readjustment of departments and faculties" to organize a "Great Law School" to confront the Communist Party. Everyone pointed out that Lou Bangyan's conspiracy was extremely vicious. He attempted to weaken or abolish the Party's leadership over political and legal education and judicial work, and replace it with rightists, so that our country's political and legal education and judicial work would return to the old capitalist road. This is something that our working class and laboring people cannot allow.
    Many people revealed that Lou Bangyan actively defended Chu Anping's fallacy of "the Party's world." After Chu Anping's fallacy of "the Party's world" was exposed, Lou Bangyan believed that Chu Anping had been hit hard and defended Chu everywhere. He said to Chen Jianguo that Chu Anping's remarks about "the Party's world" were merely "harming the meaning because of the words," which intellectuals often do. He said at the Jiusan Society branch that "Chu Anping only did two months of preparation work at the Guangming Daily and did not do anything," and also said that the propaganda in the newspaper was "distorting and fabricating rumors." He also accepted the invitation of Pu Xixiu, a rightist from the Wenhui Daily, to prepare to write an article "calmly and from the perspective of the national system" to defend Chu Anping's fallacy of "the Party's world." He himself also admitted that he attempted to drag Chu Anping's fallacy of "the Party's world" into academic theory, and distorted "speakers are not guilty" and "freedom of speech" to protect Chu Anping.

    中国政治法律学会等单位
    批驳楼邦彦的反动言行
    本报讯　中国政治法律学会、九三学社北京分社、北京市司法局最近连日举行会议，对政法学界的右派急先锋楼邦彦的反党言行进行了揭露和批驳。
    整风开始，北京市司法局副局长楼邦彦即对党展开了猖狂进攻。他反对整风采用“和风细雨”方针，说“和风细雨是对你们党员讲的，非党干部不受这个限制”，“群众有意见可以到大马路上去讲”。当司法局党组正在积极地召开座谈会，征求非党干部对党的意见时，楼邦彦却说，“大楼里（指司法局和高、中级人民法院等单位）没有整风气息”，“大楼里有不可告人的秘密，盖子还没有揭开”。又说，这次整风的规律是：“党组不如一般党员，党员不如团员，团员不如群众，共产党不如民主党派”，因此，“群众要对党施加压力”。他对北京大学右派分子向党进攻的反动言行大加赞扬，并对北大毕业的干部煽动说：“你们应该回去（指北京大学）看看，小弟弟比你们老大哥进步多啦！”右派分子陈建国、赵维侯、郭可宏等在楼邦彦数次煽动之下，连续张贴了污蔑党的大字报。当右派分子的大字报受到反击以后，楼邦彦马上大喊陈建国被“围剿”了，要陈建国“沉住气”，到中国政治法律学会座谈会上呼吁，他们还共同研究了污蔑党的发言要点。
    司法局干部朱金涛等揭露，整风开始不久，楼邦彦即拉拢一部分在肃反运动中被斗争，对党怀有不满情绪的知识分子，经常进行密谈。他以个人名义召开座谈会，搜集反党材料。他还要求参加司法局整风领导小组，搜集党的缺点和错误。
    楼邦彦还在北京政法学院座谈会上放火，污蔑党对政法界旧知识分子的改造是“一棍子打死”，以挑拨党同老教师的关系。在中共北京市委召开的非党局长座谈会上，他造谣说，“知识分子在机关里不被重视。肃反运动中被整的都是知识分子，而且都整错了”。楼邦彦是政法学界右派阴谋家钱端升小集团的急先锋，他同钱端升的反动言行遥相呼应。他认为，党对政法教育和司法工作的领导太多了，他这个副局长是“有职无权”。他说政法界从上到下宗派主义严重，应该吸收更多的非党人士担任政法界的领导工作。他还同钱端升共同阴谋策划“院系再调整”，组织“大法学院”，同共产党对抗。大家指出，楼邦彦的阴谋是十分恶毒的，他企图削弱或取消党对政法教育和司法工作的领导，由右派分子取而代之，使我国的政法教育和司法工作回到资本主义的老路，这是我国工人阶级和劳动人民所不能允许的。
    许多人揭发，楼邦彦积极为储安平的“党天下”谬论辩护。当储安平的“党天下”谬论被揭穿后，楼邦彦认为储安平受了打击，并到处为储辩护。他对陈建国说，储安平的“党天下”言论，不过是知识分子常有的“因词害意”。他在九三学社支社说，“储安平在光明日报只做两个月的准备工作，没有做什么事情”，又说，报上的宣传是“歪曲造谣”。他还应文汇报右派分子浦熙修之约，准备“平心静气，从国家制度的角度”写文章，为储安平的“党天下”谬论辩护。他自己也承认，他企图把储安平的“党天下”谬论拉到学术理论上去，并歪曲“言者无罪”和“言论自由”，以保护储安平。
