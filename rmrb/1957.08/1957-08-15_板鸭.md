    Preserved Duck
    Preserved duck is one of China's famous products, especially "Nanjing Preserved Duck" and "Nan'an Preserved Duck" are the most well-known. Preserved duck is delicious, nutritious, easy to preserve, and convenient to carry, so it is very popular.
    Nanjing Preserved Duck's fame at home and abroad is a recent phenomenon. During the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, only vendors near Zhonghua Gate sold preserved duck. Later, due to improvements in processing technology, sales expanded, and preserved duck merchants appeared. By the Xuantong period, Nanjing Preserved Duck participated in the exhibition of the Nanyang Industrial Exposition and won an award, which made its reputation increasingly prominent. Before the Anti-Japanese War, there were about 140 preserved duck shops in Nanjing. When business was at its best, they could sell more than 10,000 ducks a day. After the Anti-Japanese War, sales gradually decreased, preserved duck shops continued to close down, and the annual output of preserved duck also gradually declined. Since liberation, thanks to the strong support of the Party and the government for preserved duck production, state-owned processing plants have been established to expand production, and Nanjing Preserved Duck has once again developed.
    The characteristics of Nanjing Preserved Duck are "salty, delicious, flavorful, and white in color." This is inseparable from the excellent processing technology and special cooking methods. Nanjing Preserved Duck is processed in winter. Before processing, it is necessary to raise live ducks with grain, that is, feeding them rice for several weeks to make the duck meat white and tender and the fat thick; before slaughter, they must be "fasted and cleansed" (fed with water); after slaughter, they must be bled, plucked, and eviscerated; then "salt the embryo and stack the legs" and "put them in the brine tank"; then hang them to air dry, and they become preserved ducks.
      "Nan'an Preserved Duck" is one of the special products of Jiangxi Province. It is mainly produced in the southern part of Jiangxi, especially Dayu Preserved Duck is the most famous (because Dayu originally belonged to Nan'an Prefecture, hence the name "Nan'an Preserved Duck"). Nan'an Preserved Duck is made differently from Nanjing Preserved Duck. In addition to some sales in the mainland, Nan'an Preserved Duck is mainly resold to Nanyang and other places through Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hong Kong and other places.
    In addition, preserved duck is also produced in Baxian County, Sichuan, and Hefei, Anhui.

    板鸭
    板鸭是中国的名产之一，尤以
  “南京板鸭”和“南安板鸭”最著名。板鸭味道鲜美、富有营养、易于保存、便于携带，所以受人欢迎。
    南京板鸭驰名中外，还是近代的事情。在清乾隆年间，只有中华门一带摊贩经营板鸭。后来由于加工技术改进，销售日广，才有板鸭座商出现。到宣统年间，南京板鸭参加南洋劝业会的展览，获得了奖状，从此声誉日著。抗日战争以前，南京有板鸭商店约一百四十户，生意最兴隆时，每天可销售板鸭达一万余支。抗日战争以后，销路日渐减少，板鸭商店不断倒闭，板鸭的年产量也随之逐渐下降。解放以来，由于党和政府对板鸭生产的大力支持，建立了国营加工厂扩大生产，南京板鸭才又发展起来。
    南京板鸭的特点，是“咸鲜可口、香味浓厚、色泽洁白”。这是与加工技术优良和特殊的烹煮方法分不开的。南京板鸭是在冬季加工。在加工制做之前，先要稻膘活鸭，即喂养数星期稻子，使鸭肉白嫩，膘肥；宰前要“禁食清肠”（喂以清水）；宰后要放血、拔毛、去内脏；然后才“盐胚垒胫”和“下卤缸”；再吊挂风吹，乃成板鸭。
      “南安板鸭”是江西省的特产之一。主产在赣南一带，尤以大庾板鸭最著名（因大庾原属南安府，故有“南安板鸭”之称）。南安板鸭与南京板鸭的制做方法不同。南安板鸭除内地销售一部外，主要通过上海、广州、香港等地转销南洋一带。
    此外，我国出产板鸭的地方，还有四川巴县和安徽合肥一带。
