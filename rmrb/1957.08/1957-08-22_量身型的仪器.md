　　Body Measurement Instrument

　　Lin Juyun, a sewing technician from Guangdong Province, has trial-produced an electric body shape determination instrument. This instrument is specially designed to measure the amount of fabric needed for making clothes, and it is accurate and convenient. Regardless of whether the person is an adult or a child, tall, short, fat, or thin, as long as you stand on the instrument's footboard, the height measuring ruler will automatically press on your shoulders to measure your height. Then, buckle the chest measuring ruler and waist measuring ruler on your chest and waist, and the number on the top of the measuring instrument will automatically light up, telling you which body type you belong to. You can take this number to any cotton cloth store or clothing store in the city to make clothes. They will look up the number in a unified fabric manual (the manual is printed with various styles of different fabric amounts, widths, and shrinkage amounts for men, women, and children, as well as cutting and layout illustrations) and know the style you want to make and how much fabric to use. This type of body measurement does not require measuring the body every time you make clothes, but only once or twice a year at most. If the body shape does not change, one measurement is sufficient.

　　After preliminary trial use in Guangzhou, the effect is very good—it can save cotton cloth. It is now being prepared for widespread use in commercial, industrial, and processing-related departments. (Ai Ling)

　　量身型的仪器
    广东省缝纫技师林举钧，试制出一部电动的身型衡定仪器。这部仪器是专门衡量人体做衣服用料数量的，准确，方便。不论大人小孩，个子不论高、矮、胖、瘦，只要你站上仪器的踏脚板，衡高尺便会自动压在肩膀上量体高。再把衡胸尺和衡腰尺扣上胸间和腰间，于是衡定仪的顶端号码，便会自动亮起来，告诉你是属于何类身型。你拿着这个号码可以到市内各棉布店或服装店制衣服。他们会按号码在统一的布手册里查阅，（手册编印有男女童各式各样不同布额、宽度、缩水额，还有裁排插图）便知道你要做的式样、该用多少布料。这样的衡量体型，并不需要做一次衣服量一次身型，而只是一年顶多量一两次，如果身型无变动，量一次就可以。
    经广州市初步试验使用，效果很好——能节约棉布。现正准备在商业、工业、加工有关部门普遍使用这种仪器。　（艾玲）
