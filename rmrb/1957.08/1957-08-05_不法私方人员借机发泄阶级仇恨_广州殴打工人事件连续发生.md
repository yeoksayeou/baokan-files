Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 4th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Huang Cheng reports: Recently, in Guangzhou's jointly-owned public-private stores, unlawful private individuals have launched a frenzied attack on workers. From April to the present, serious incidents of unlawful private individuals beating workers have occurred continuously in nine stores in the catering, medicinal materials, and barber industries.

On June 18th, Feng Zhu, the private manager of the jointly-owned public-private Yinghe Restaurant on Changshou East Road in the Western District, and five private employees including Feng Chun, under the pretext of a minor matter (workers turned off the electricity on time to save electricity, which the private individuals prevented and scolded), groundlessly and collectively beat worker Yan Zhuo severely. They used carrying poles, benches, bamboo chairs, and wooden clogs to beat Yan Zhuo, causing him serious injuries. Feng Rong (Feng Zhu's elder brother), the private manager of the neighboring Rongtai Restaurant, also rushed over to join in the assault upon hearing the noise. After Yan Zhuo was beaten to the ground, Feng Zhu even ferociously attempted to strangle him. After Yan Zhuo was rescued by workers from the Rongtai Restaurant, Feng Zhu still chased after him with a bamboo pole to beat him, and yelled, "If I had a knife, I would stab you to death." Liang Jin, the private manager of Tianhetang Medicinal Materials Store on Zhuguang Road in the Northern District, and his wife and mother-in-law, falsely accused female worker Mo Huiai of stealing and collectively beat her. Mo Huiai's head was injured and a handful of her hair was pulled out. Huang Bingcai, the private manager of Huizhong Northern Restaurant on Zhongshan Fifth Road in the same district, on July 18th, deliberately splashed sewage on worker Xing Huaisheng. Xing Huaisheng argued with him as a result, and Huang Bingcai actually picked up a kitchen knife to attack Xing Huaisheng. After he was blocked by the employees, he fiercely said to the employees: "I'm not afraid of going to jail if I beat you to death."

The origin of these incidents of private individuals beating employees is due to their hatred of the working class's supervision of them. Yan Zhuo is the only worker in the Yinghe Restaurant and has worked in the store for seven or eight years. He is often unreasonably scolded by Feng Zhu and others. Because Yan Zhuo safeguarded national interests and reported the facts of Feng Zhu and others' harming the public and benefiting themselves to higher authorities several times, Feng Zhu and others hated him even more. Mo Huiai, a worker at Tianhetang Medicinal Materials Store, had reported Liang Jin's illegal activities such as purchasing medicinal materials for speculation to the union several times, so Liang Jin hated her very much. Liang Jin came from a landlord family, and his ex-wife committed suicide during the land reform struggle. Liang Jin had written down the names of more than a dozen activists in the land reform in an attempt to retaliate. After the right-wing elements launched a frenzied attack on the Party, he said, "Now the opportunity has come." After beating Mo Huiai, he also threatened Mo Huiai through someone, saying: "When the Kuomintang comes, you won't be able to die enough times." Huang Bingcai, the private manager of the Northern Restaurant, also beat employees and vented his class hatred because his attempt to arrange for his son to work in the store was rejected by the employees, and his illegal acts such as forcibly borrowing money and embezzling public funds in the store were often reported and criticized by the employees.

    不法私方人员借机发泄阶级仇恨
    广州殴打工人事件连续发生
    新华社广州4日电　新华社记者黄成报道：最近以来，广州市公私合营商店不法私方人员向工人进行了猖狂的进攻。从4月到现在，在饮食、药材、理发等三个行业的九家商店内连续发生了不法私方人员殴打工人的严重事件。
    6月18日，西区长寿东路公私合营应合饭店私方经理冯柱和私方从业人员冯纯等五人在晚上假借一件小事（工人为了节约用电，按时关熄电，私方人员加以阻止谩骂）毫无理由地集体毒打工人严焯。他们用扁担、板凳、竹椅、木屐将严焯殴成重伤，隔邻荣泰饭店私方经理冯荣（冯柱之兄）闻声也赶到参加行凶，严焯被殴打倒地后，冯柱还凶狠地企图捏死严焯。当严焯被荣泰饭店的工人抢救出来后，但冯柱还拿着竹竿追出来殴打，并扬言“有刀我就劈死你。”北区珠光路天和堂药材店私方经理梁金和其妻、岳母三人诬说女工莫惠爱偷东西而集体加以殴打。莫惠爱的头部受伤并被拔去头发一把。这个区的中山五路惠中北方馆私方经理黄炳才在7月18日借故把污水泼在工人邢怀生身上，邢怀生因此和他发生争执，黄炳才竟拿起菜刀来扑斩邢怀生。他被职工挡住后竟凶狠地对职工们说：“老子打死你们，坐监也不怕”。
    这些私方人员殴打职工事件的起因都是由于仇恨工人阶级对他们的监督。严焯是应合饭店唯一的工人，在店里工作已有七八年，常常受到冯柱等人的无故责骂。由于严焯维护国家利益，几次向上级揭发了冯柱等人损公利己的事实，冯柱等对他更恨之入骨。天和堂药材店工人莫惠爱，曾几次向工会揭发梁金套购药材进行投机等违法行为，因而梁金十分仇恨她。梁金是地主出身，他的前妻在土地改革中被农民斗争自杀，梁金曾写下土改积极分子十多人的名字企图报仇，当右派分子向党发起猖狂进攻后，他曾说“现在机会到了”，在殴打莫惠爱后，他还通过人威胁莫惠爱说：“国民党来了你多多不够死。”北方馆私方经理黄炳才也是由于想安排他的儿子入店工作遭到职工拒绝以及在店里强行借钱挪用公款等违法行为经常受到职工的揭发和批评，而借故殴打职工发泄阶级仇恨。
