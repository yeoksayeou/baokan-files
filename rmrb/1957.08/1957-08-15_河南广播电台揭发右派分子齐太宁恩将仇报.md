Xinhua News Agency Special Dispatch: Henan People's Broadcasting Station exposed the rightist element, Qi Taining, an editor at the station. During the period of great contending and blooming, he proposed: "The current members of the editorial committee are ignorant and incompetent and should step down. The editorial committee should be reorganized." He advocated that "the members of the reorganized editorial committee should not be limited to Party members. Anyone can participate." He first recommended another rightist, Ma Xirui (historical counter-revolutionary), and himself to join the editorial committee, advocating that Ma Xirui should "lead the work." He spread the word everywhere, saying: "Our group has no Party members, and we are doing a great job because there is no political 'noise.'"

Qi Taining's family were despotic landlords. After the land reform, he and his family conspired to murder two village cadres and activists. Later, the government announced leniency towards him. However, he repaid kindness with enmity, writing in his diary: "For you (referring to the members of his family), I can die... In this dreadful time, my bayonet will be sharper, my eyes will be keener, and I will struggle to the final victory on this battle line of life and death."

    河南广播电台揭发右派分子齐太宁恩将仇报
    新华社专稿　河南人民广播电台揭露出右派分子，电台的编辑齐太宁。在大鸣大放期间，他提出：“现在的编委委员不学无术，应让位，编委会要改组”，他主张“改组后的编委会委员，应当不只限于党员，什么人都可以参加”。他首先推荐另一右派分子马锡瑞（历史反革命）和他自己参加编委会，主张由马锡瑞“领导业务”。他到处散布说：“我们组里没有党员，工作做的很好，因为没有政治‘噪音’。”
    齐太宁的家庭是恶霸地主，土地改革后，他和他的家庭同谋杀死了村干部、积极分子两人。后来政府宣布对他的宽大处理。可是他却恩将仇报，在日记中这样记着：“为了你们（指他家庭的成员），我可想死……。在这可怖的时候，我的刺刀会更锐利，眼光会更锐敏，我要在这生死战线上，挣扎到最后的胜利。”
