    The Ice Cellar of "Old City Top"

    "Old City Top" is the highest mountain peak in Yuhuan County, Zhejiang. The mountain is often foggy and the climate is cold. Based on the climatic characteristics of the mountain top, the Gucheng Township Branch of the Chinese Communist Party mobilized more than 1,000 commune members last winter to brave the severe cold and dig twenty-six ice pits on the mountain, and carried more than 90,000 dan of ice and snow into the pits.

    Since the weather began to get hot this year, Gucheng Township has begun selling ice blocks to supply the local Fishery Cooperative for refrigerating fresh fish. By the end of June, the township had sold more than 80,000 dan of ice blocks, increasing the income of commune members in the township's seven agricultural cooperatives by more than 96,000 yuan. According to the statistics of the five production teams in Yangjia Natural Village, Jincheng Second Cooperative, income from ice blocks accounted for more than 80% of the total annual income. The Jin Chuansheng family received more than 200 yuan from ice blocks alone. This was something they would never have dreamed of before the cooperativization. ·Wang Gang·

    “老城头”的冰窖
    “老城头”是浙江玉环县最高的山头。山上多雾，气候寒冷。中共古城乡支部根据山头气候的特点，在去年冬季发动一千多社员，冒着严寒在山上掘了二十六个冰坑，并把九万多担冰雪担进了坑内。
    今年天气开始炎热以来，古城乡开始出卖冰块，供当地渔业合作社冷藏鲜鱼。到6月底止，全乡已出售冰块八万多担，全乡七个农业社的社员增加收入九万六千多元。据金城二社杨家自然村五个生产小队统计，冰块收入占全年总收入的80％以上。社员金传盛一户单冰块一项就分到了二百多元。这件事要是在合作化以前，那是做梦也不会想到的。　·王刚·
