Zhang Bojun, accepting Luo Longji's recommendation, once intended to appoint the rightist "theorist" Chen Xingui as the editor-in-chief of Guangming Daily. What kind of person is Chen Xingui? Why did Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji appreciate him so much?

The Socialist Academy's exposure of Chen Xingui's numerous reactionary statements and actions answers this question.

Chen Xingui said: Spiritual life in recent years has not been as pleasant as before liberation

Chen Xingui often said to people: "Spiritual life in recent years has not been as pleasant as before liberation." However, when the bourgeois rightists were launching a frantic attack on the Communist Party, Chen Xingui became active. He said: "I have never been so happy." At that time, he once said: "The 'Hungarian Incident' is very likely to happen in China, and if it happens, it will be unmanageable." He thought the time had come, and he made a series of absurd remarks against the Communist Party and against socialism at the forums held by the Central Committee of the China Democratic League and the Socialist Academy.

Chen Xingui not only maliciously slandered that "the dictatorship of the proletariat is the root cause of the 'three evils'," but also viciously slandered the past revolutionary movements, especially the anti-espionage movement. He falsely accused these movements of "being a major source of creating contradictions" and "promoting idealism and selling idealism," and believed that the conclusion that "achievements are the main thing and shortcomings are individual" is "anti-Marxist-Leninist."

Chen Xingui distorted the new atmosphere of the past revolutionary movements as "only political unity, not ideological and emotional unity, just like an asphalt road, with gravel underneath, which breaks when it encounters a shock."

Chen Xingui portrayed the Chinese Communist Party as a "dictator," and he openly launched vicious personal attacks on Chairman Mao and Comrade Liu Shaoqi. He was very dissatisfied with the hanging of Chairman Mao's portraits in the offices of the democratic parties, and he demanded that the offices of the democratic parties should hang portraits of their own party leaders.

Chen Xingui attacked the People's Daily and Xinhua News Agency with ulterior motives. He said that "Xinhua News Agency is in crisis," that the People's Daily is "dogmatic," and "no one wants to read it," and boasted that Guangming Daily and Wenhui Daily are "the best newspapers in terms of layout and content." At the same time, Chen Xingui also declared in the Socialist Academy that he would withdraw from school and go to Guangming Daily to take on "important work."

Chen Xingui extremely hated the Soviet Union and hated Marxism-Leninism. He viciously slandered that Stalin's mistakes and the occurrence of the Hungarian incident were all caused by the dictatorship of the proletariat. He said: "Capitalism has crises, and socialism also has crises; capitalism is going to be finished, and socialism is also going to be finished." He also absurdly said that the people of socialist countries have no "friendship" with the Soviet Union, they all "hate the Soviet Union," and the reports saying that socialist countries are strongly united are "polite words" and "sounds good."

After Chen Xingui made a series of reactionary remarks at the Socialist Academy, he returned to the headquarters of the China Democratic League and said triumphantly: "I fired a big cannon today. I said that the past movements were all against Marxism-Leninism, which is even more powerful than the statement that 'the harm outweighs the benefit'." When the newspapers were rebuking Chu Anping's reactionary remarks, Chen Xingui shamelessly fabricated that "the Communist Party hates Chu Anping because Chu Anping mentioned a coalition government, which is what the Communist Party is most afraid of." He believed that Chu Anping's long-bankrupt fallacy of "the party's world" was truly digging up the Communist Party's "old roots." When he spread these fallacies, he said that he might become a counter-revolutionary and that he had "made preparations!"

Originally a key member of the Zhang-Luo alliance

What is the relationship between Chen Xingui and Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji? It turns out that Chen Xingui was a key member of the Zhang-Luo alliance. As early as when Luo Longji and Zhang Dongsun were engaged in small cliques in the China Democratic League, Chen Xingui was an active participant. Before the Zhang-Luo alliance was formed, Chen Xingui was one of the pillars of Luo Longji's small clique.

Luo Longji and Chen Xingui met in 1945. In 1946, Chen Xingui wrote an article "Democratic Fighter Luo Longji" in "Character Magazine," praising Luo Longji highly. Since then, the relationship between Luo Longji and Chen Xingui has become even closer. Wherever Luo Longji went, he would arrange for Chen Xingui to be his eyes and ears. After liberation, when Luo Longji served as the director of the Propaganda Committee of the China Democratic League, he arranged for Chen Xingui to be his secretary. When Luo Longji was in charge of the Foreign Affairs Group of the CPPCC and the Propaganda Department, he took Chen Xingui with him as his secretary. Later, Chen Xingui became the confidant of Luo Longji's small clique. In 1951, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League held a re-election, and Luo Longji supported Chen Xingui to run for election, conspiring to seize the leadership of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League. With the support of Luo Longji, Chen Xingui rose rapidly, and in 1956 he became an alternate member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League.

When the counterattack against the rightists had just begun, Luo Longji was abroad. At that time, Chen Xingui was very flustered and felt that the problem was very serious, and he made a self-criticism at the forum of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, expressing his willingness to dig up the roots and confess the problem. However, after Luo Longji returned to Beijing, Chen Xingui changed again. He stubbornly resisted with a rogue attitude, saying that he would die for "truth."

Chen Xingui's relationship with Zhang Bojun was also very close. Before the rectification forum of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League on June 10, Chen Xingui said to people: "Zhang Bojun is going to fight today, and I am going to fight today too." At the meeting, Chen Xingui continued to make reactionary remarks. After the meeting, Zhang Bojun talked to Chen Xingui. Zhang Bojun rebuked Chen Xingui for not seizing the opportunity and complained that he should not "say such things at this time."

On the day Zhang Bojun made his confession, Chen Xingui went to Yin Zhaoxiong's home for a secret talk. Chen Xingui gave fifteen instructions to Zhao Wenbi, a confidant of Luo Longji. Chen Xingui fabricated many rumors, such as: "The school党委 system is going to be abolished. Chairman Mao has agreed to pilot it at Tsinghua University, and the Tsinghua University 党委 has been abolished"; "Agricultural cooperation has been rash"; and so on.

When these rumors and other reactionary remarks fabricated by Chen Xingui were exposed at the general meeting of the Socialist Academy, Chen Xingui could not deny them. He had to admit that his "crimes are serious."

Why such a frantic attack on the Party?

Why did Chen Xingui attack the Communist Party and the people so frantically? If we uncover his family background and take a look, this question will become very clear.

Chen Xingui grew up studying in church schools and received funding from foreign missionaries, which cultivated his strong comprador mentality.

Chen Xingui is from Jiangling, Hubei. His father, Chen Juanhuang, was a local tyrant and landlord with blood debts. During the Great Revolution, he counterattacked the peasants and, because of his accusation, Zhang Wenshen, the captain of the vanguard team who insisted on revolutionary activities in the local area at that time, was arrested and killed by the puppet army regiment. In 1952, Chen Juanhuang committed suicide in fear of punishment during the land reform.

Chen Xingui's younger brother, Chen Xinbing, was a traitor and a counter-revolutionary. He served as the leader of the Japanese intelligence team and the deputy of the puppet rural team, and killed revolutionary cadres. He was shot by our guerrillas in 1948.

Chen Xingui has always defended the interests of his landlord family. Even today, he still says that his father was a middle peasant and his brother was "farming."

It turns out that Chen Xingui has a "father-killing hatred" and a "brother-killing hatred" for the Communist Party. No wonder people who worked with Chen Xingui for six or seven years revealed: "In six or seven years, I have not heard Chen Xingui say a good word about socialism, nor have I heard Chen Xingui say a good word about the Communist Party. Whenever the Communist Party and socialism were mentioned, Chen Xingui would always engage in malicious abuse."

    右派理论家陈新桂的嘴脸
    新华社记者　于民生
    章伯钧接受罗隆基的推荐，曾经准备要右派“理论家”陈新桂出任光明日报总编辑。陈新桂是怎样的一个人？章伯钧和罗隆基为什么这样赏识他呢？
    社会主义学院揭露出来的陈新桂的大量反动言行，为这个问题作了回答。
    陈新桂说：几年来精神生活不及解放前愉快
    陈新桂经常对人这样说：“几年来精神生活不及解放前愉快”。可是，在资产阶级右派分子向共产党疯狂进攻的时候，陈新桂活跃起来了。他说：“我从来没有这样高兴过。”那时，他曾经说：“‘匈牙利事件’很可能在中国发生，如果发生，将不可收拾。”他以为时机已到，他在民盟中央和社会主义学院所举行的座谈会上发表了一系列反对共产党反对社会主义的荒谬言论。
    陈新桂不但恶意地污蔑“无产阶级专政是产生‘三害’的根源”，而且对历次革命运动，特别是肃反运动，恶毒地进行了诽谤。他诬蔑这些运动“是制造矛盾的重大根源”，是“助长了唯心主义，推销了唯心主义”，认为“成绩是主要的，缺点是个别的”这种结论是“反马列主义”的。
    陈新桂把历次革命运动出现的新气象，歪曲为“只有政治上的一致，没有思想感情上的一致，正如柏油路一样，柏油下面是碎石，一遇震动就破碎了。”
    陈新桂把中国共产党描绘成“独裁者”，他公然对毛主席和刘少奇同志进行恶毒的人身攻击。他对民主党派机关挂毛主席像很为不满，他要求民主党派机关应该挂自己党派领袖的像。
    陈新桂别有用心地攻击人民日报和新华社。说“新华社危机到了”，说人民日报是“教条”，“没有人想看它”，并吹嘘光明日报和文汇报“无论编排和内容，都是最好的报纸”。同时，陈新桂还在社会主义学院扬言要退学，到光明日报去担任“重要工作”。
    陈新桂极端仇恨苏联，仇恨马克思列宁主义。他恶毒地诬蔑斯大林的错误和匈牙利事件的发生，都是无产阶级专政制度造成的。他说：“资本主义有危机，社会主义也有危机；资本主义要完蛋，社会主义也要完蛋。”他还荒谬地说，社会主义国家的人民对苏联没有什么“友谊”，都“恨苏联”，报上说社会主义国家坚强团结是“应酬话”，是“讲得好听”。
    陈新桂在社会主义学院发表了一系列反动言论后，回到民盟总部得意忘形地说：“我今天放了大炮，我说过去的历次运动都是违反马列主义的，这话比‘害多利少’的提法还厉害。”当报纸上对储安平的反动言论进行反击的时候，陈新桂竟无耻地捏造说：“共产党恨储安平，是因为储安平提到联合政府，这是共产党最害怕的。”他认为，储安平的早已破了产的“党天下”的谬论是真正所谓挖了共产党的“老根”。当他散布这些谬论的时候，他说他可能成为反革命分子，他已经“作了准备了！”
    原来是章罗联盟的一员干将
    陈新桂同章伯钧、罗隆基的关系怎样呢？原来陈新桂是章罗联盟的一员干将。远在罗隆基和张东荪在民盟搞小集团的时候，陈新桂就是积极的参加者。在章罗联盟没有形成以前，陈新桂是罗隆基小集团的支柱之一。
    罗隆基和陈新桂是在1945年相识的。1946年陈新桂在“人物杂志”上写了一篇“民主斗士罗隆基”的文章，大捧罗隆基。从此，罗隆基和陈新桂的关系就更加密切了。罗隆基到了那里，就在那里安插陈新桂当他的耳目。解放以后，罗隆基任民盟宣委会主任，安插陈新桂作秘书，罗隆基负责政协外交组和和大宣传部工作时，又把陈新桂带去作秘书。再以后，陈新桂又变成了罗隆基小集团的心腹。1951年，民盟北京市委改选，罗隆基支持陈新桂去竞选，阴谋夺取民盟北京市的领导权。陈新桂在罗隆基的支持下扶摇直上，1956年他成为民盟中央候补委员。
    反击右派刚刚开始的时候，罗隆基在国外。那时陈新桂是很慌张的，觉得问题很严重，并且在民盟中央的座谈会上检讨，表示愿意挖根交代问题。可是，罗隆基回到北京以后，陈新桂又变了，他以耍无赖的态度进行顽抗，说什么要为“真理”而死。
    陈新桂同章伯钧的关系也是很密切的。6月10日在民盟中央的整风座谈会之前，陈新桂就对人说：“章伯钧今天要战斗，我今天也要战斗。”会上陈新桂继续发表了反动言论。会后，章伯钧找陈新桂谈话。章伯钧责备陈新桂没有见机而行，埋怨他不该“到这时候还讲这种话”。
    在章伯钧进行交代的那一天，陈新桂曾到尹肇雄家里去密谈。陈新桂向罗隆基的亲信赵文璧作了十五点指示。陈新桂制造了许多谣言如：“学校党委制要撤走了，毛主席已同意在清华作试点，清华党委已撤消了”；“农业合作化有冒进”；等等。
    当陈新桂制造的这些谣言和其他反动言论在社会主义学院的大会上被揭发以后，陈新桂抵赖不过，他只得承认了，他说他的“罪恶是严重的”。
    为什么这样疯狂向党进攻？
    陈新桂为什么这样疯狂地向共产党向人民进攻呢？揭开他的家庭出身看一看，这个问题就很清楚了。
    陈新桂是在教会学校里读书长大的，并且得到外国传教士的资助，因而培育了他浓厚的买办思想。
    陈新桂是湖北江陵人，他的父亲陈眷煌是一个负有血债的恶霸地主。在大革命时代曾向农民进行倒算，并且由于他的控告当时在当地坚持革命活动的先锋队队长张文申被伪军团逮捕杀害，1952年土地改革时，陈眷煌畏罪自杀。
    陈新桂的弟弟陈新炳是汉奸，是反革命分子，曾任日寇情报组长，伪乡队副，杀害过革命干部。在1948年为我游击队枪决。
    陈新桂一贯维护他的地主家庭的利益，直到今天他还说他的父亲是中农，他的弟弟是“务农”的。
    原来陈新桂对共产党有“杀父之仇”，有“杀弟之恨”。难怪和陈新桂在一起工作六、七年的人揭露说：“在六七年里，没有听到陈新桂对社会主义说过一句好话，也没有听到陈新桂对共产党说过一句好话，一提起共产党和社会主义，陈新桂总是进行恶意的谩骂。”
