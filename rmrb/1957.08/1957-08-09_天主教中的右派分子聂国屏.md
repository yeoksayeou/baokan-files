Nie Guoping, a member of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League and a rightist element in the Catholic Church, took advantage of the Party's rectification campaign to maliciously attack the Party's religious policies, and to sow discord between Catholics and the People's Government, saying that "in the anti-imperialist struggle in the early days of liberation, some local policies were unclear, hurting the feelings and self-esteem of many devout believers." He also slandered the land reform, the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Campaigns, and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries as being mistakes. As a representative of the Tianjin Municipal People's Congress, Nie Guoping, after returning from an inspection tour, publicly clamored: "Those who were sentenced to ten or twenty years in prison in the past should be declared innocent today," attempting to reverse verdicts. He deeply hated the people's democratic system and promoted the "democracy and freedom" of the American bourgeoisie. At Tianjin Normal College, he directed his lackeys to post many big-character posters that fabricated rumors and attacked the Party, smearing the Party cadres in the school as "people in ivory towers" who were idle all day long, demanding their replacement.

What kind of person is Nie Guoping? It turns out that he was born into a comprador bourgeois family and had always received slavish education in Catholic and Christian middle and primary schools and Yenching University run by American imperialists. During the Japanese occupation, after graduating from university, he established relations with traitors and engaged in speculative trading, co-operating with others to run the "Youxing Construction Company" and the "Zhengmao Securities Firm," etc. After the surrender of the Japanese invaders, he even brought in a traitorous relationship and joined Du Fuxiang, who had formed a traitorous army in Dacheng County, under whose banner he formed a mixed army, serving as a "lieutenant colonel secretary," dreaming of being incorporated by Chiang Kai-shek. Later, he met Wu Jinglue, the confidential secretary of Gao Shuxun, and even helped this high-ranking official with "receiving" [assets and property from the Japanese and their collaborators]. Just as his good dream was at its height, General Gao Shuxun revolted [joined the Communist side].

Driven by greed, Nie Guoping turned to Yu Bin, the anti-communist leader, through Catholic connections. In 1946, he served as a director of the "Catholic Cultural Advancement Association" instigated by Yu Bin. Under the direction of Kuomintang special agent Liu Nairen, he started "cultural salons" and "singing classes," developing five or six hundred members, becoming an accomplice of imperialist elements in the Catholic Church in carrying out counter-revolutionary activities.

These activities of Nie Guoping were deeply appreciated by Shao Hua, the head of the Kuomintang secret service, who personally introduced Nie Guoping to the Kuomintang at the end of 1946. After that, he also served as a director of the reactionary organization "People's National Construction Advancement Association" established by the famous international spy, Belgian priest Reynaert, and also intervened in the reactionary newspaper Yishibao as an associate, and also worked as a lecturer at Jingu University, becoming a prominent figure with multiple positions.

After the national liberation, the Party and the people did not hold his past misdeeds against him, and allowed him to serve as a representative of the Tianjin Municipal People's Congress and the Director of General Affairs of the Tianjin Higher Education Bureau, etc. However, Nie Guoping repaid kindness with malice, and since the beginning of the rectification campaign, he has openly and madly attacked the Party.

    天主教中的右派分子聂国屏
    民盟天津市委委员、天主教中的右派分子聂国屏，利用党整风的机会，恶意攻击党的宗教政策，挑拨天主教徒和人民政府之间的关系，说什么“在解放初期的反帝斗争中，有些地方政策不明，伤害了很多虔诚教徒的感情和自尊心”。并诬蔑土改、三反、肃反等政治运动搞错了。身为天津市人民代表的聂国屏，视察工作回来后，竟公开叫嚣：“过去判十年二十年徒刑的，今天都应该宣判无罪了”，企图翻案。他十分仇恨人民民主制度，宣扬美国的资产阶级的“民主自由”。并在天津师范学院，指挥他的喽啰贴了许多造谣攻击党的大字报，污蔑学校里的党员干部是整日无所事事的“象牙之塔里的人”，要求撤换他们。
    聂国屏是个什么样的人呢？原来他出身于买办资产阶级的家庭，一直在天主教和基督教办的中、小学和美帝国主义办的燕京大学受奴化教育。日伪占领时期，他大学毕业后就同汉奸拉关系，干起投机买卖来，与别人合营过“友星营造公司”，搞过“正茂证券行”等。日寇投降后，他竟拉上一个汉奸关系，投到曾在大城县搞汉奸队的杜福祥门下，搞起杂牌军，他担任“中校秘书”，做等待蒋介石收编的“美梦”。后来他又认识了高树勋的机要秘书吴景略，还帮助这位大员“接收”，正当好梦方酣，高树勋将军起义了。
    利欲熏心的聂国屏，又通过天主教的关系，投靠反共头子于斌。1946年担任了于斌策动成立的“天主教文化协进会理事”，在国民党特务刘乃仁指使下，搞起“文化沙龙”、“歌唱班”等，发展了五、六百会员，成为天主教内帝国主义分子进行反革命活动的帮凶。
    聂国屏这些活动，深得国民党特务头子邵华的赏识，1946年底亲自把聂国屏介绍加入国民党。之后，他又担任著名的国际间谍、比利时神甫雷震远成立的反动组织“民众建国协进会”的理事，同时插足于反动报纸益世报作协理，又在津沽大学作讲师，俨然成为身兼数职的要人。
    全国解放后，党和人民对他不念旧恶，让他当天津市人民代表、高等学校总务长等职。可是聂国屏却以怨报德，在整风开始以来明目张胆地向党猖狂进攻。
