Reported by Xinhua News Agency: The bourgeois right-wing elements in the engineering and technical circles of Gansu Province, under the pretext of "helping the Communist Party rectify its work style," launched venomous attacks on the Party. Some right-wing elements slandered the Communist Party, saying that it "doesn't understand science and technology but insists on leading, resulting in utter chaos." They advocated that "the management of factories and mines must be reformed in terms of organizational structure," insisting that engineers should lead the administrative cadres in charge of their departments, and even arrogantly demanded that "the Party Committee should absorb the chief engineer and representatives of the masses to jointly decide on the management of the enterprise." Zhang Zeji, a right-wing element and engineer at the Lanzhou Refinery, believed that China's twelve-year science plan was "empty bragging," and said that "the Party has become detached from Party members and the masses." Other right-wing elements distorted the idea that "Communist Party members are always acting like ancestors to the masses, never like service personnel," and cursed "the Communist Party for putting on a two-man act and making ugly faces."

Li Chonghua, a right-wing element and technician at the Gansu Provincial Urban Design Institute, groundlessly clamored: "Engineering and technical personnel are puppets in factories and mines, with positions but no power."

Right-wing elements in various units also openly opposed the socialist system. Zhang Zan, a right-wing element and deputy chief engineer of the First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, viciously cursed the socialist system as "hegemonism," and suggested that the Communist Party should learn from Liu Bang's "Three Laws" and Emperor Wen of Han's "Kingly Way." Zhang Yintang, a right-wing element and technician at the Yumen Oilfield, even said shamelessly: "The American social system is better than the social system of New China."

These absurd remarks of the right-wing elements have been refuted by the broad masses. Some right-wing elements were so overwhelmed by the refutation that they admitted their mistakes on the spot and promised to continue confessing their problems. The anti-rightist struggle in the engineering and technical circles of Gansu Province is now deepening step by step.

    仇恨共产党　仇恨人民
    看这些右派工程师的心肠
    本报讯　甘肃省工程技术界的资产阶级右派分子，借口“帮助共产党整风”，向党进行了恶毒的攻击。一些右派分子诬蔑共产党“不懂科学技术硬要领导，因而乱成一塌糊涂”。他们主张“厂矿企业的管理必须从机构体制上改革”，主张由工程师来领导本部门的行政负责干部，甚至狂妄地要求“党委会应该吸收总工程师和群众的代表参加，共同决定管理企业”。兰州炼油厂右派分子、工程师张泽吉，认为我国的十二年科学规划是“瞎吹牛”，并且说“党已经脱离了党员和群众”。还有的右派分子歪曲“共产党员尽当群众的祖宗，没有当勤务员的”，骂“共产党是唱双簧打鬼脸”。
    甘肃省城市设计院右派分子、技术员李崇华无中生有地叫嚣：“工程技术人员在厂矿企业中是傀儡，有职无权”。
    各单位的右派分子，还公开反对社会主义制度。铁道部第一工程局右派分子、副总工程师张瓒，恶毒地骂社会主义制度是“霸道”，建议共产党要学刘邦的“约法三章”和汉文帝的“王道”。玉门油矿右派分子、技术员张印堂更无耻地说：“美国社会制度比新中国的社会制度要好些。”
    右派分子的这些荒谬言论，受到了广大群众的驳斥。有的右派分子被驳得理穷词尽，当场表示承认错误，答应继续交代问题。现甘肃省工程技术界的反右派斗争正在步步深入中。　　（新华社专稿）
