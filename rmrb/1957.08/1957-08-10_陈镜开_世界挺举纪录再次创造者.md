Chen Jingkai – Creator of the World Record Again in the Clean and Jerk
Guo An
On the weightlifting platform in Moscow, the light flyweight weightlifting competition of the International Youth Friendship Games of the Sixth World Youth Festival was in full swing…

The announcer reported: "Chinese athlete Chen Jingkai clean and jerks 140 kilograms." The whole arena fell silent. Chen Jingkai calmly walked to the barbell, took a deep breath, gripped the barbell with both hands, flipped his wrists forcefully, and pulled the 140-kilogram barbell to his chest. After pausing for two seconds, he suddenly shouted and in one lunge lifted the barbell high above his head. When the three white lights indicating success lit up on the weightlifting platform, the whole arena erupted, everyone congratulating him, embracing him, offering flowers… The twenty-one-year-old Chen Jingkai once again set a world record in the light flyweight clean and jerk, and won the light flyweight weightlifting championship of the festival with a total score of 322.5 kilograms. At that time, the five-star red flag was raised, and the Chinese national anthem was played.

Chen Jingkai has a natural physique for a weightlifter. He is only one meter forty-nine centimeters tall (more than a head shorter than the average person), with broad shoulders, short, thick arms, and the most astonishing thing is his two short and unusually thick legs—as thick as twenty-three inches, standing on the ground like two stone pillars. However, the important key to Chen Jingkai's ability to set world records lies in his diligent training.

Chen Jingkai formally started weightlifting training after joining the People's Liberation Army in 1955. In middle school, he was interested in sports such as basketball, football, and swimming, and occasionally practiced weightlifting. After joining the army, after more than two months of formal practice, he participated in the national weightlifting test, at that time his total score was only 245 kilograms; but many insightful people saw the infinite potential in Chen Jingkai. Soon, he was selected as a member of the Chinese Youth Weightlifting Team and participated in the Fifth World Youth Festival. On the way through Moscow, they made a short visit and study. When the famous Soviet coach Pustovoit saw Chen Jingkai, he excitedly picked him up and said: "What a good weightlifting physique, this is a future world champion." Chen Jingkai and other team members, under the guidance of Pustovoit and Osipov, conducted short-term training. Chen Jingkai listened to the coach's guidance and seized the time to bury himself in hard training. In this short period of time, he understood the principle that weightlifting relies on the strength of the whole body, and also corrected his shortcomings of leaning forward and unstable center of gravity when lifting the barbell, so his weightlifting performance quickly improved by 37.5 kilograms. Coach Pustovoit happily said: "I have been a coach for decades, and I have rarely seen such an obedient and fast-improving student." When leaving Moscow, Coach Osipov wrote on a photo album he gave him: "I wish you to become the world's best weightlifter in the next two years and set a world record in the clean and jerk." In just one year, Chen Jingkai fulfilled his teacher's wishes. Last June, in a competition with the Soviet weightlifting team in Shanghai, he broke the world record in the light flyweight clean and jerk with a score of 133 kilograms.

After breaking the world record, Chen Jingkai was not complacent at all, and practiced even more diligently. He not only practiced in the weightlifting room on time, but also corrected his incorrect postures in front of the mirror in the dormitory over and over again during rest. When he encountered problems in practice, he wrote to his teacher in Moscow for advice. In order to strive to break the world record in the clean and jerk again, Chen Jingkai conducted long-term hard training before going abroad this time. He put the 200-kilogram barbell on his shoulders and practiced squatting and standing up again and again, successfully lifting the 140-kilogram barbell several times. Therefore, Chen Jingkai went to participate in the International Youth Friendship Games of the World Youth Festival this time full of confidence.

On August 6, exciting news finally came that young Chen Jingkai had set a world record in the light flyweight clean and jerk and won the championship. He, once again, won honor for the motherland with his diligence and hard work!

    陈镜开——世界挺举纪录再次创造者
    国安
    在莫斯科的举重台上，第六届世界青年联欢节的国际青年友谊运动会的最轻级举重比赛正在激烈进行着……。
    广播员报告了：“中国运动员陈镜开挺举一百四十公斤。”全场顿时肃静无声。陈镜开从容地走到杠铃前，作了一下深呼吸，双手握住杠双腕猛力一翻，一百四十公斤的杠铃便拉上胸前，停了两秒钟，他突然大喊一声，一个箭步便将杠铃高高举起。当举重台上表示成功的三个白灯一齐亮了的时候，全场沸腾起来了，大家纷纷向他祝贺、拥抱、献花……。二十一岁的陈镜开又一次创造了最轻级挺举的世界纪录，并且以三百二十二点五公斤的总成绩获得了联欢节最轻级举重冠军。当时，场上升起了五星红旗，奏起了中国国歌。
    陈镜开有着一副天生的举重运动员的体型。他身高仅一公尺四十九公分（比常人要矮一头多），宽肩、双臂粗短，最令人惊异的是两条短而又异常粗壮——粗达二十三英寸、站在地上如同两根石柱一般的腿。但是，陈镜开所以能够创造世界纪录，重要的关键还是在于刻苦锻炼。
    陈镜开正式练举重是在1955年参加解放军以后。在中学时代他对篮球、足球、游泳等运动都有兴趣，偶然也练练举重。到部队以后，经过两个多月的正式练习，他便参加了全国举重测验，那时总成绩才达到二百四十五公斤；可是很多有见识的人，都在陈镜开身上看到了无穷的潜力。不久，他被选为中国青年举重队队员，参加了第五届世界青年联欢节。在路过莫斯科的时候，他们作了短期的访问和学习。苏联著名的教练普斯特握依特见到陈镜开时兴奋地把他抱了起来，说：好一副举重身材，这是未来的世界冠军。陈镜开和其他队员在普斯特握依特和奥西波夫指导下，进行了短期的训练。陈镜开很听教练的指导，抓紧时间埋头苦练。在这短短的时间里，他懂得了举重要靠全身力量的道理，也纠正了自己在举杠铃时上身前倾、重心不稳的缺点，因此举重成绩很快便提高三十七点五公斤。普斯特握依特教练高兴地说：我当了几十年的教练，很少见到这样听话而又进步得这样快的学生。在离开莫斯科时，奥西波夫教练在送给他的一本照相册上面题着：“祝你在最近两年内成为世界最优秀的举重运动员，并创造挺举的世界纪录”。时间不过一年，陈镜开果然实现了老师的祝言。去年6月在上海同苏联举重队比赛，他以一百三十三公斤的成绩，打破了最轻级挺举的世界纪录。
    打破了世界纪录，陈镜开一点都不自满，练习得更勤奋了。他不仅按时在举重房里练，就是在休息的时候，在宿舍内还对着镜子，一遍又一遍地纠正着不正确的姿势。当他在练习中遇到问题的时候，就向莫斯科的老师去信请教。为了争取再次创造挺举的世界纪录，陈镜开在这次出国前又进行了长时间的苦练。他把二百公斤的杠铃压在肩上，一遍又一遍地练习着下蹲和起立，几次成功地举起了一百四十公斤的杠铃了。因此，陈镜开这次去参加世界青年联欢节的国际青年友谊运动会比赛是满怀着信心。
    8月6日，终于传来了令人兴奋的消息，年轻的陈镜开创造了最轻量级挺举的世界纪录，获得了冠军。他，再次以他的勤学苦练为祖国争取了荣誉！
