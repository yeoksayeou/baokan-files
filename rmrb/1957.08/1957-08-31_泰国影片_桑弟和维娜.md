The Thai Film "Santi and Veena"

　　Not long ago, the Thai Art Troupe visited our country and brought us many precious artistic performances, as well as the friendship of the Thai people. This year, our films have also begun to be shown in Thailand. The cultural exchanges between China and Thailand are demonstrating the further development of friendship and mutual understanding between the two peoples. "China and Thailand are one family" is a force in maintaining peace in Asia and the world.
　　Now, we will have the pleasure of seeing the first Thai color film "Santi and Veena" screened in our country, which is something to be cherished.
　　The film depicts a love story between Santi, a young man who is blind, and Veena, a warm, kind, and beautiful girl. Because Santi's family was poor, he was sent to a Buddhist cave to be a disciple of the old monk Rudra since he was a child. However, Santi and Veena have had a deep relationship since they were young, and love blossomed between them in their youth. The landlords and gentry in the village laughed at her for falling in love with a blind man, and Gran, the landlord's son, even wanted to take Veena's love because of this. However, Veena did not waver at all, and she left with Santi. Unfortunately, they were intercepted by Gran, who forcibly took Veena away, and Santi was also beaten badly and returned to the Buddhist cave. Just as the story was about to end, the Buddhist cave collapsed, and the old Rudra was crushed to death by the rubble in order to protect Santi, while Santi's eyes were restored due to the violent tremor. However, Veena was no longer by his side. Santi lost his beloved girl and his respected mentor, and he finally put on the yellow robe and became a monk.
　　This film not only reflects the hardworking, warm, and simple lives of the Thai people, but also exposes the tragic experiences of kind people under that unreasonable social situation. The film is full of praise for goodness and hatred for evil!
　　Veena is willing to share the joys and sorrows with Santi, and is unwilling to succumb to Gran in order to greedily enjoy life. Although she was forced to marry Gran, she still said to Santi: "I still love you as I did in the past, even if I die...". Here, we can see Veena's pure, beautiful heart and kind character.
　　As a person despised by that society, Santi has so many bloody tears to accuse those unfair treatments. However, he has been living in night-like darkness, and he can only be manipulated by others. Apart from his father, only Veena and old Rudra can give him warmth, and the evil forces of society have not let go of someone like him. Early on, he had a strong hope to open his eyes and praise his and Veena's youth, to praise the kind people around him who had pity on him, and to praise the beautiful scenery of nature. But now that his eyes have been restored, there is nothing worthy of his praise in everything that surrounds him, and he painfully shouts: "I don't want this world, I don't want anything, what's the use of restoring my sight? Let me be blind!" Yes, under that unreasonable situation, restoring his sight did not give him any happiness, and his hope has been turned to ashes. The creation of this image is relatively complete. It should be said that Santi's becoming a monk is his silent accusation against that unreasonable social situation.
　　This film is excellent in terms of editing, directing, and acting. What is especially valuable is that the film has well combined and promoted the artistic characteristics of the Thai nation. The interweaving of several song and dance scenes is also very appropriate. The boat dance on the river during the Water Lantern Festival is exactly the form of the "Nam Wang" dance loved by the Thai people. The "water lanterns" floating lightly on the clear water, accompanied by joyous festival songs flowing down the river, fully express the atmosphere of this festival. In the scene where Veena participates in a dance performance, the graceful and tender dance postures of the classical dance "Lakhon" are intertwined with ancient zither music, which is truly beautiful.
　　The color of the film is also very beautiful, especially the tropical scenery presented to our eyes, which is even more fascinating through the rendering of color. Palm trees, stilt houses with combed leaves, towering pointed pagodas, and the clear, tropical sky, all of this constitutes a series of charming scenery.

　　泰国影片“桑弟和维娜”
    许蔚文
    不久以前，泰国艺术团到过我国访问演出，给我们带来了很多珍贵的艺术表演，也带来了泰国人民的友谊。我国的电影，在今年以来，也开始陆续在泰国映出。中泰两国间的文化交流，正显示了两国人民的友好和相互了解的进一步发展，“中泰一家亲”就是维护亚洲与世界和平的一支力量。
    现在，我们将有眼福看到第一部在我国映出的泰国彩色影片“桑弟和维娜”，这是一件值得珍视的事情。
    影片描写一个双目失明的青年桑弟同一个热情、善良而美丽的姑娘维娜的恋爱故事。桑弟因家境贫困，从小就被送到佛洞里去给老僧侣留塔做弟子，然而，桑弟和维娜从小就有着深厚的感情，青年时代，爱情就在他们中间滋长了。村子里的地主豪绅们却在嘲笑她爱上了一个瞎子，地主的儿子格兰还想借此来夺取维娜的爱情。可是，维娜并没有丝毫的动摇，她带着桑弟一同出走。不幸，他们被格兰截住，格兰用暴力把维娜抢夺过去，桑弟也惨遭毒打，返回佛洞。就在故事快将结束的时候，佛洞崩塌了，老留塔为了救护桑弟而惨被乱石轧死，桑弟则因剧烈的震动而双目复明。可是，维娜已经不在他身边了。桑弟失去了心爱的姑娘，也失去了尊崇的导师，他终于穿上黄袍出家。
    这部影片不仅反映了泰国人民的勤劳、热情、朴实的生活，而且揭发了在那种不合理的社会现状下善良人民的悲惨遭遇。影片充满着对善良的歌颂和对邪恶的憎恨！
    维娜愿意和桑弟共甘苦，不愿意为了贪图生活的享受而屈从于格兰。虽然，她被逼和格兰结婚，但她仍然对桑弟说：“我还是和过去一样的爱你，那怕我就是死去……”。这里，我们可以看见维娜的纯洁、美丽的心灵和善良的性格。
    作为被那种社会鄙弃的人，桑弟有着多少血泪言语控诉那些不公平的待遇。可是，他一直是生活在长夜似的黑暗里，他只能任人摆布。周围除了他的父亲之外，就只有维娜和老留塔能够给他以温暖，社会的恶势力也没有放过他这样一个人。很早的时候，他就有过强烈的希望，睁亮自己的眼睛，来赞美他和维娜的青春，赞美他周围怜悯过他的好心人，赞美那大自然的秀丽景色。而现在他的双目复明了，萦绕在他眼前的一切事物，都没有值得他赞美的了，他痛苦地叫喊着：“我不要这个世界，我不要任何东西，恢复我的光明有什么用呢？还是让我瞎了吧！”是的，在那种不合理的现状下，恢复他的光明并没有还给他什么幸福，他的希望已经化为灰烬了。这个形象的创造，是较为完整的。应该说，桑弟的出家，是他对于那种不合理的社会现状的无声控诉。
    这部影片在编、导、演方面都是出色的，尤为可贵的是影片很好的结合和发扬了泰国民族的艺术特点，几个歌舞场面的穿插也很适当。水灯节河上舢舨舞蹈，正是泰国人民群众喜爱的“喃旺”舞蹈的形式，清澈的水面上轻盈地飘浮着的“水灯”，伴随着欢乐的节日赞歌逐流而下，充分地表现了这一节日的气氛。在维娜参加舞蹈演出的一幕，古典舞“洛坤”的优美、柔情的舞姿交织着古琴音乐，真是美不胜收。
    影片的色彩也很优美，特别是呈现在我们眼际的热带风物，通过色彩的渲染，更是引人入胜。棕榈树、高脚栉叶屋、巍峨的尖顶佛塔、热带特有的晴朗高空，这一切构成了一幅幅迷人的景致。
