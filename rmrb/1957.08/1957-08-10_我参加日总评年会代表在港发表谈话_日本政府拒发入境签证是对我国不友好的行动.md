Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 9th August. Chen Yu, the representative dispatched by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to Tokyo to attend the ninth大会 of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), made a statement to journalists in Hong Kong on the 8th regarding the Japanese government's unreasonable delay and refusal to issue an entry visa.

Chen Yu said that the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) invited the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in early July to send a representative to participate in the ninth大会 of Sohyo held in Tokyo from August 3rd to 6th. Based on the desire to develop friendly relations between the people of China and Japan, and the increasingly enhanced friendly relations between the trade unions of the two countries in recent years, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions decided to appoint me as a representative to go to Japan and telegraphed this decision to the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo). I arrived in Hong Kong with a translator on July 30th and immediately applied for an entry visa at the Japanese Consulate in Hong Kong. The Consul stated that he would immediately send a telegram to inquire with the Japanese government. However, we have been滞留 in Hong Kong for ten days, and the ninth大会 of Sohyo has already closed, but we have still not obtained an entry visa to Japan. Therefore, we have decided to leave Hong Kong and return to Beijing.

Chen Yu continued, "We are very sorry that the Japanese government has not yet issued an entry visa, preventing me from traveling to Japan after the Sohyo annual meeting has already concluded. We believe that the Japanese government's attitude is very unfriendly, and our Chinese trade unions and workers cannot but feel revulsion and indignation about this. This unfriendly action by the Japanese government towards China goes against the wishes of the vast number of Japanese workers and people. The friendly relations between the people and trade union organizations of China and Japan cannot be easily undermined by anyone. This friendly relationship will continue to develop while overcoming various man-made obstacles."

On the same day, Chen Yu also telegraphed the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), expressing gratitude for Sohyo's friendly invitation and regret to Sohyo for the Japanese government's unreasonable delay in refusing to issue a visa, which caused him to滞留 in Hong Kong and unable to make the trip. The telegram stated: "Chinese trade unions and workers cannot but feel revulsion and indignation at this very unfriendly attitude of the Kishi Nobusuke government."

Chen Yu has decided to leave Hong Kong for Beijing tomorrow.

    我参加日总评年会代表在港发表谈话
    日本政府拒发入境签证
    是对我国不友好的行动
    新华社香港9日电　中华全国总工会派往东京参加日本工会总评议会第九次大会的代表陈宇，就日本政府无理拖延拒发入境签证问题，8日在香港向新闻记者发表谈话。
    陈宇说，日本工会总评议会7月初邀请中华全国总工会派代表参加8月3日至6日在东京举行的总评第九次大会。基于发展中日两国人民友好的愿望，和几年来中日两国工会之间日益增进的友谊关系，中华全国总工会决定委派我作为代表前去日本，并把这一决定电告日本工会总评议会。我携翻译一人于7月30日抵达香港，当日即向日本驻香港领事馆办理入境签证，该馆领事称：即电询日本政府。但是我们已在香港先后滞留达十日，日本总评第九次大会已经闭幕，我们仍未获得去日本入境签证，因此已决定即离港返北京。
    陈宇接着说，我们感到十分遗憾的是，日本政府至今还没有发给入境签证，使我在总评年会已闭幕后尚未能成行。我们认为日本政府这一态度是十分不友好的，我们中国工会和工人对此不能不感到反感和愤慨。日本政府这种对中国不友好的行动是违背日本广大工人和人民的愿望的，中日两国人民和工会组织之间的友好关系绝不是任何人所能轻易破坏的。这种友好关系将会在排除各种人为的障碍中继续不断地发展。
    陈宇并在同日致电日本工会总评议会，对总评的友好邀请表示感谢，对日本政府无理拖延拒发签证，以致他滞留香港未能成行，向总评表示遗憾。电报说：“中国工会和工人对岸信介政府这一十分不友好的态度不能不感到反感和愤慨”。
    陈宇已决定明日离香港返北京。
