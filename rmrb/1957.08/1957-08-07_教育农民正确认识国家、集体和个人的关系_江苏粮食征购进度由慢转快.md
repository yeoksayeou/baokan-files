Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 6th. During the grain procurement period, rural areas in Jiangsu Province strengthened socialist education, and procurement work has progressed. In the second half of July, the province averaged over 40 million jin of public grain turned in and surplus grain sold each day, three times more than the daily average in the first half of July.

This year, Jiangsu Province had increased summer grain production, and the procurement task was less than last year. However, after the wheat harvest, farmers were slow to turn in and sell grain, and the completion of the state procurement task was very poor. Many agricultural cooperatives and their members unilaterally emphasized collective and individual interests, concealed production, retained more rations, and demanded to sell less surplus grain and turn in less public grain.

In response to the above ideological situation, Party organizations at all levels widely educated cooperative cadres and members on the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual, as well as on running cooperatives industriously and thriftily, managing families industriously and thriftily, and saving grain. They used the method of recollection and comparison to calculate detailed accounts, to inspire and mobilize farmers to actively sell surplus grain and turn in public grain. Cooperative cadres and members improved their ideological understanding and, based on the principle of "public before private, state before individual," formulated summer harvest pre-distribution plans, first selling off the surplus grain that should be sold and turning in the public grain that should be turned in. The Binhuai Township Agricultural Cooperative in Suqian County discussed the spirit of "the state supports us during disasters, and we support the state after a bumper harvest," sending more than 410,000 jin of public grain to the granary and braving the rain to send more than 150,000 jin of surplus grain that should be sold to the grain purchasing and marketing station. More than 300 agricultural cooperatives in Pixian, Tongshan, Ganyu, Juining, and other counties have completed or exceeded their summer grain payment and sales tasks. At present, all regions are continuing to conduct political and ideological education for farmers, striving to complete the summer grain procurement task by mid-month.

    教育农民正确认识国家、集体和个人的关系
    江苏粮食征购进度由慢转快
    据新华社南京6日电　江苏省农村在粮食征购期间加强社会主义教育，征购工作有了进展。全省7月下半月平均每天缴公粮、售余粮四千多万斤，比7月上半月平均每天增多了三倍。
    江苏省今年夏粮增产，征购任务比去年少，但是农民在麦子登场后，缴、售粮食行动缓慢，完成国家征购任务很差。许多农业社和社员片面强调集体和个人利益，瞒报产量，多留口粮，要求少卖余粮和少缴公粮。
    中共各地党组织针对上述思想情况，广泛地向社干部和社员进行了国家、集体、个人三者关系，和勤俭办社、勤俭治家、节约用粮的教育，用回忆对比算细账的办法，启发和动员农民积极卖余粮、缴公粮。社干部和社员提高了思想认识，根据“先公后私，先国家后个人”的原则，制定夏收预分方案，首先把应卖的余粮卖清，应缴的公粮缴完。宿迁县滨河乡农业社和社员讨论了“受灾时国家支持，丰收后支持国家”的精神，把四十一万多斤公粮送入粮库，并且冒雨把应售的十五万多斤余粮送到粮食购销站。邳县、铜山、赣榆、雎宁等县三百多个农业社已经完成或超额完成夏粮缴、售任务。目前，各地正继续对农民进行政治思想教育，争取中旬完成夏粮征购任务。
