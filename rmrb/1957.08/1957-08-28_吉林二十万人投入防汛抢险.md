Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, August 27th: In recent days, around 200,000 people in Jilin Province have been working day and night on flood prevention, rescue, and drainage along the Songhua River, Nen River, East Liao River, Yinma River, Yitong River, and in low-lying areas.

　　From the 20th onwards, typhoons brought heavy rain to the Tonghua area in the upper reaches of the Songhua River, with rainfall exceeding 100 millimeters in many places. The heavy rain converged into flash floods, leading to a major flood peak on Songhua Lake by the 24th. Many places downstream have successively exceeded the warning and guarantee water levels. In addition, the Nen River area has experienced continuous rainfall since late July, and the river's floodwaters have not receded. Strong winds of level seven or eight are common. Approximately 100,000 people along the two rivers, under the leadership of local Party and government cadres, are engaged in a tenacious battle against the flood. The Jilin Provincial People's Committee has also dispatched ten working groups, including technical personnel, to assist various localities with flood prevention and rescue.

　　Lishu and other counties have experienced continuous rain since the beginning of August, resulting in waterlogging on 180,000 hectares of land. Approximately 100,000 people in these areas are also involved in drainage and flood control.

　　吉林二十万人投入防汛抢险
    新华社长春27日电　这些天，在吉林省松花江、嫩江、东辽河、饮马河、伊通河沿岸和低洼地带，约有二十万人不分昼夜地防汛抢险和排涝。
    从20日起，由台风带来的暴雨袭击松花江上游通化地区，许多地方的降雨量在一百公厘以上。暴雨汇成了山洪，以致到24日松花湖上出现了大洪峰。下游不少地方接连超过了警戒水位、保证水位。另外，嫩江地区从7月下旬以来不断降雨，江面洪水一直未见下落，目前常有七、八级大风。两江沿岸有十万人左右，在当地党、政机关干部领导下，和洪水展开了顽强的斗争。吉林省人民委员会并派出包括技术人员在内的十个工作组，协助各地防汛抢险。
    梨树等县地区从8月上旬起阴雨连绵，有十八万公顷土地发生了内涝。这些地区也有十万人左右在排水治涝。
