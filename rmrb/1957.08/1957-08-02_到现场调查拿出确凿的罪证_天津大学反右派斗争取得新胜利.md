By conducting on-site investigations and producing conclusive evidence, Tianjin University has achieved a new victory in the anti-Rightist struggle.

(Reported by this newspaper) Following the initial victory of Tianjin University’s entire student body in the struggle against the Rightists in June, over 800 graduating students at Tianjin University achieved a second victory from July 11th to 22nd.

Compared to the previous stage, this stage of the struggle possessed new and more favorable conditions. The students conscientiously studied Chairman Mao's speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and Premier Zhou's government work report at the National People's Congress. Everyone had ideological weapons to counterattack the Rightists. At the same time, they also gained some political experience from the previous stage of the struggle and had a certain understanding of the Rightists' conspiracies.

As early as when the students were helping the Party with rectification, some "contending and blooming societies" emerged among the students under the guise of helping the Party's rectification. Such as the "Spring Thunder" society organized by Li Chaogui, Lu Tianxiu, etc., the "Wind and Rain" society organized by Chen Yong, etc., the "Gauze" society organized by Wan Jiawei, etc., the "DDT" society organized by Zhu Chengxiang, etc., the "Contending and Blooming" society organized by Wang Wei, etc., and a small number of fourth-year students majoring in internal combustion engines led by Zhang Lunji. These Rightists "lit fires" everywhere during the contending and blooming period, inciting the masses to attack the Party.

Some of these student Rightists' activities were supported behind the scenes. The Rightist Wang Houqiang was Huang Shaohong's nephew, and he received support from Huang Shaohong. He collected so-called "injustice" materials on campus and went around "redressing grievances" for others.

Despite the Rightists' rampant behavior, the awakened students were determined to defeat the attacks of these Rightists.

One of the main methods for students to pursue the Rightists was to expose the facts of their conspiratorial activities. Many students, in order to clarify the truth, spontaneously organized themselves to investigate the places where the Rightists had lit fires. Some classes, even though they did not engage in face-to-face struggles with the Rightists in meetings, also took the initiative to report the facts they knew or exposed them in the form of big-character posters.

After more than ten days of exposure and reasoned struggle, in the face of facts and truth, the Rightists were completely isolated, and most of them had bowed their heads and confessed their guilt to the people.

### 到现场调查拿出确凿的罪证  天津大学反右派斗争取得新胜利

    到现场调查拿出确凿的罪证
    天津大学反右派斗争取得新胜利
    本报讯　天津大学八百多应届毕业生继天津大学全体学生在6月间同右派斗争的第一回合中取得了巨大胜利之后，从7月11日至22日又取得第二回合的胜利。
    同前一阶段比较，这一阶段的斗争具备了新的更为有利的条件。同学们认真地学习了毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲演，和周总理在这次全国人民代表大会会议上所作的政府工作报告，大家有了反击右派的思想武器；同时，也从前一阶段的斗争中获得了一定的政治经验，对右派分子的阴谋活动有了一定的认识。
    早在同学们帮助党整风的时候，学生里出现了一些以帮助党整风为名的“鸣放社团”。如李朝贵、卢田修等组织的“春雷”社，陈勇等组织的“风雨”社，万嘉蔚等组织的“纱布”社，朱呈祥等组织的“D、D、T”社，王渭等组织的“鸣放”社，以及以张伦基为首的内燃机专业四年级少数学生。这些右派分子，在鸣放期间到处“点火”，煽动群众向党进攻。
    这些学生中的右派分子的活动，有些是得到幕后支持的。右派分子王厚强是黄绍竑的外甥，他就得到了黄绍竑的支持。他在校内搜集所谓“冤枉”材料，到处替人“伸冤”。
    尽管右派分子们如此猖狂，但是觉悟了的同学们是要坚决打垮这些右派分子的进攻的。
    同学们追击右派分子的主要方法之一，就是揭露他们阴谋活动的事实，许多学生为了弄清事实真相，自动组织起来到右派分子曾经点过火的地方去调查；有些班的同学，虽未跟右派分子在一个会上展开面对面的斗争，也主动将自己知道的事实检举出来或是用大字报形式揭发出来。
    经过十多天的揭发和说理斗争，在事实与真理面前，右派分子已完全孤立了，其中大部分人已向人民低头认罪。
