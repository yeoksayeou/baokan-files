Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, August 29th. The Albanian Tirana football team defeated the Chinese First Machine Sports Association football team in Lüda this afternoon with a score of 1-0.

　　In the first half, the visiting team adopted a three-midfielder, three-forward formation (WM style) with close division of labor, while the home team adopted zone defense, creating a passive situation. In the first minute, the visiting team passed the ball to the center forward, and Yareci Skander kicked the ball into the goal. After the visiting team scored, their offensive was fierce, shooting a total of nineteen times in the first half, but they did not score again. In the second half, although the home team reversed the passive situation and strengthened their attack, they were unsuccessful due to the visiting team's tight defense. The visiting team's shots were also intercepted, resulting in no further score.

　　The Tirana football team will leave Lüda tomorrow for Tianjin.

　　地拉那足球队在旅大获胜
    新华社旅大29日电　阿尔巴尼亚地拉那足球队今天下午在旅大以一比零战胜中国第一机械体育协会足球队。
    上半时，客队采取了三前卫制三前锋制（WM式）紧密分工，主队则采取区域防守，形成被动局面。在第一分钟内，客队把球传到中锋，亚列齐·斯康杰尔一脚踢进了大门。客队得分后攻势猛烈，上半场共射门十九次，但都没有再开纪录。下半场，主队虽然转变被动局面，加强进攻，但因客队防守严密，都未得手。客队射门也被截住，不分胜负。
    地拉那足球队将在明天离开旅大，前往天津。
