Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, August 26th: The Fujian Provincial Committee and Fuzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party jointly held anti-Rightist struggle conferences on the 16th and 20th to systematically expose and criticize the anti-Communist and anti-socialist conspiratorial activities of Li Shuzhong, the agent of the Zhang Bojun-Huang Qixiang-Li Boqiu Rightist clique in Fujian Province. Representatives from other democratic parties' local organizations in Fujian and non-party democratic人士 also participated in the conference.

According to the revelations, in March and April of this year, Li Shuzhong had secret dealings with Zhang Bojun, Li Boqiu, Li Jiansheng, and others while attending the National Working Conference of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. After returning to Fujian, he promoted Zhang Bojun's anti-Soviet, anti-Communist, and "upper house" fallacies everywhere, and vigorously implemented the Zhang-Huang-Li Rightist clique's malicious plan to expand their organization, attempting to increase the membership of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party in Fujian Province from several hundred to over ten thousand. At the meeting of the Chairman and Vice-Chairmen of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Li Shuzhong openly put forward the absurd proposal that all cadres who came south should be withdrawn to the north to return home to production, to be replaced by local cadres, and at the provincial cadre meeting of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, he incited, "We must compete with the Communist Party for People's Representatives and CPPCC members; we have not competed enough in the past." At a symposium of democratic parties held in late May and early June, he also proposed to the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party that "democratic parties should participate in personnel work," attempting to seize personnel leadership from the Communist Party. Subsequently, Li Shuzhong conspired with Huang Zhen, asking their confidants to collect materials from the "Three-Anti and Five-Anti" movements, attempting to "rehabilitate" people. The two of them also used the name of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party to issue instructions to their subordinate organizations, saying: "Many non-party people are drawn to the democratic parties. At present, all city (county) organizations should vigorously expose contradictions to help the Communist Party rectify its work on the one hand, and seize the opportunity to develop the organization, striving to complete and overfulfill this year's development plan on the other hand." Li Shuzhong even while sick in the hospital for recuperation, he did not relax his plan to attack the Party and socialism. In addition to viciously scolding the nurse who was taking care of him, saying that "the Communist Party is 'extremely bad,' you should boldly 'speak out'," he also planned to hold a forum for medical staff in the hospital to ignite the flames. At the same time, Li Shuzhong and others placed their confidants in Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, Putian, Fuzhou and other cities, as well as in Fujian Agricultural College, Fujian Normal College, the Provincial Department of Industry, the Department of Education, and the Provincial People's Bank, all of whom lit fires everywhere, launching a frenzied attack on the Communist Party and socialism. For example, Li Shuzhong's confidant, Zhuang Qinggui, Deputy Director of the Quanzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, once extremely viciously insulted the Communist Party and Communist Party members. Another of Li Shuzhong's cronies, Yu Shenchu, Director of Teaching Affairs at the Fuzhou Traditional Chinese Medicine Training School, even incited students to struggle against workers, plotting to create incidents and instigate strikes, class boycotts.

When Li Shuzhong's and Zhang Bojun's organized and planned conspiracy to echo each other from north to south to attack the Communist Party was exposed, Li Shuzhong and his confidants conspired again to retreat. He not only refused to confess his relationship with Zhang Bojun and others and expose Zhang Bojun's anti-Soviet and anti-Communist conspiracy, but also publicly defended Zhang Bojun at the meetings where members of the Fujian Provincial Committee and the grassroots organizations of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party were fighting back against the Rightist leader Zhang Bojun, together with other Rightist backbone elements. He also used the excuse that "there is not enough material now" in a vain attempt to suppress the members from holding meetings to launch a struggle against Zhang Bojun. Later, in the face of accusations and irrefutable evidence, Li Shuzhong repeatedly used methods such as writing false self-criticisms and sophistry in a vain attempt to muddle through.

According to the revelations, the conspiracy between Li Shuzhong and Zhang Bojun and others to carry out the so-called "Third Route" in Fujian Province has been going on for a long time. As early as after the Huaihai Campaign in 1948, Li Shuzhong traveled between Fujian, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, advocating and plotting the so-called "Fujian Independence Movement," echoing Zhang Bojun's conspiracy to take Fujian, Jiangxi, and other provinces as bases to "divide the world into three parts." After the liberation of Fujian, Li Shuzhong climbed to the position of Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party and Vice-Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. He then secretly colluded with Zhang Bojun's confidant, Huang Nong, a member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, to jointly plan to take advantage of the rampant activities of special agents and bandit armed forces in Fujian at that time, to send sixteen special commissioners in the name of reorganizing "Party affairs," attempting to establish contact with special agents and bandit armed forces who had previously had relations with the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, and carry out ulterior motives. However, their conspiracy was soon exposed, and ten of the sixteen special commissioners were sentenced to death or placed under surveillance because they were active counter-revolutionaries and bad elements. In August and September 1953, when the Rightist leader Li Boqiu came to Fujian to "inspect Party affairs," he conspired with Li Shuzhong, wanting to contact Li Shihao in Zhejiang, Shen Baowen in Shanghai, Deng Haoming in Nanjing, and others, attempting to form an anti-Communist and anti-socialist alliance of Rightists in the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party organizations in Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and other provinces and cities. In addition, Li Shuzhong colluded with Huang Zhen, the personal careerist and Vice-Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, to shield counter-revolutionaries, and recruited some counter-revolutionaries and people dissatisfied with the Communist Party into the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party or placed them in the organs of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, using methods such as promising official positions and forming Rightist cliques to carry out conspiratorial activities.

    策划所谓“福建独立运动”  到处散布反共反苏谬论
    李述中是个恶毒透顶的阴谋家
    新华社福州26日电　农工民主党福建省委和福州市委在16、20日联合举行反右派斗争大会，系统地揭露和批判了章伯钧—黄琪翔—李伯球右派集团在福建省的代理人李述中的反共反社会主义的阴谋活动。参加大会的还有其他民主党派福建省地方组织和无党派民主人士的代表。
    据揭露，今年3、4月间，李述中在参加农工民主党全国工作会议时，曾和章伯钧、李伯球、李健生等暗相往来。他回到福建以后，就到处宣传章伯钧的反苏反共和“上议院”等谬论，并和黄震等大力执行章、黄、李右派集团的恶性发展组织的计划，想把农工民主党福建省的成员由几百人发展到万人以上。李述中在人民政协福建省委员会主席、副主席办公会议上，公然提出要南下干部一律北撤回家生产，由本地干部代替的荒谬主张，并在农工民主党全省干部会议上煽动说：“我们要向共产党争人民代表、争政协委员，过去我们争得不够”。在5月底6月初召开的民主党派座谈会上，他又向中共福建省委提出“民主党派要参加人事工作”，企图和共产党争夺人事领导权。接着，李述中又和黄震密谋，叫他们的心腹收集肃反材料，企图
  “平反”。他们两人并且利用农工民主党福建省委名义向所属组织发出指示说：“许多非党人士向心于民主党派，各市（县）组织，当前一面应大力揭发矛盾帮助共产党整风，一面应抓紧发展组织，争取完成和超额完成今年发展计划。”李述中甚至在生病进医院疗养时也毫不放松他们向党向社会主义进攻的计划，他除了恶毒地向看护他的护士大骂“共产党‘坏透了’，你们应该大胆‘放’”以外，还准备在医院中召开医务人员座谈会进行点火。同时，李述中等人安置在漳州、泉州、莆田、福州等市和福建农学院、福建师范学院、省工业厅、教育厅和省人民银行等单位的心腹爪牙，也都到处点火，向共产党向社会主义猖狂进攻。如李述中的心腹——农工民主党泉州市委副主任委员庄清桂，就曾经极其恶毒地辱骂共产党和共产党员。另一个李述中的亲信——福州中医进修学校教导主任余慎初，竟煽动学员斗争工友，阴谋制造事件，策动罢工、罢教、罢课。
    当李述中和章伯钧等有组织有计划地南北呼应向共产党进攻的阴谋败露后，李述中又和他的心腹密谋退却的策略。他不但拒不交代他和章伯钧等人的关系和揭露章伯钧的反苏反共阴谋，反而在农工民主党福建省委和福州市基层组织成员反击右派头子章伯钧的会议上，和其他右派骨干分子一起公开为章伯钧辩护。并以“现在材料还不足”为借口，妄图压制成员开会向章伯钧展开斗争。以后，在众人指控、铁证如山面前，李述中又三番五次地用写假检讨和狡赖等手法，妄图蒙混过关。
    据揭露，李述中和章伯钧等人相互勾结，在福建省进行所谓“第三路线”的阴谋勾当由来已久。早在1948年淮海战役结束后，李述中就往来福建、台湾和香港之间，鼓吹和策划所谓“福建独立运动”，和章伯钧妄想以福建、江西等省为根据地“三分天下”的阴谋相呼应。福建解放后，李述中爬上了农工民主党福建省委主任委员、人民政协福建省委员会副主席的地位，他又暗中同章伯钧的亲信、农工民主党中央委员黄农等共同策划，利用福建当时特务、土匪武装活动猖獗的机会，以整理“党务”为名，派出十六个特派员，妄图同过去和农工民主党有过关系的特务、土匪武装建立联系，进行不可告人的勾当。但他们的这一阴谋不久就被揭穿，十六个特派员中有十个因是现行反革命分子和坏分子被判处死刑或被管制。1953年8、9月间，右派头子李伯球来福建“视察党务”时，又和李述中密谋，想和浙江李士豪，上海的申葆文、南京的邓昊明等联系，企图把广东、福建、浙江、上海、江苏等省市农工民主党组织中的右派分子结成反共反社会主义的联盟。此外，李述中同个人野心家、农工民主党福建省委副主任委员黄震相勾结，包庇反革命分子，并把一些反革命分子、对共产党不满的分子拉进农工民主党或安插在农工民主党机关中工作，采用封官许愿等办法组织右派小集团进行阴谋活动。
