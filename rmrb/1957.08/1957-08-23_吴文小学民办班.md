　　"Wuwen Elementary School Private Class"
　　By our reporter Gao Changren
    Gongcheng Advanced Cooperative of Rongjiawan Township, Yueyang County, Hunan Province, started a primary school in the first semester of 1956, funded by the masses themselves. This private senior primary school is attached to the public Wuwen Elementary School. It does not yet have a formal name; people simply call it the "Wuwen Elementary School Private Class." The students are divided into two classes, learning the fifth-grade curriculum.
    The leadership of this private senior primary school is the school affairs committee, composed of parent representatives and cooperative cadres. The school affairs committee is responsible for raising and spending funds, hiring teachers, and deciding on major matters in the school. The current three teachers are all hired by the school affairs committee.
    The source of funding is a tuition fee of five yuan per student per semester. This fund is kept by the school affairs committee and used successively for teachers' salaries and essential teaching expenses. The teachers' salaries are twenty-four to twenty-six yuan per month.
    According to the teachers, the current teaching content and quality are consistent with those of public senior primary schools. The students are doing very well, and the parents are very supportive. They are confident in continuing to run this private senior primary school well.
    This private senior primary school began its trial operation in the first half of last year. At that time, there were only thirty-nine students, and the quality of the teachers hired was not high, so some courses could not be taught. There were also many difficulties with classroom equipment. However, with the help of the teachers and the agricultural cooperative, and with the spirit of diligence and thrift in running the school, these difficulties were finally overcome. When there were not enough classrooms, they consulted with the agricultural cooperative and borrowed the houses of the farmers' spare-time school; students attended classes during the day, and farmers studied culture in the evening. When there was a shortage of desks, dozens of benches were borrowed from the farmers' homes to replace them, and stools were brought by the students from their homes. When textbooks were lacking and could not be bought for a while, the teachers borrowed them from the public senior primary school, and if they could not be borrowed, they were temporarily mimeographed. Some students who lived far away also had to board at the school, so Wuwen Elementary School cleaned up an old building, repaired it slightly, and used it as a student dormitory, using floorboards and door panels to replace beds. At that time, a total of only forty yuan was spent on construction to settle the students.
    The development of this private senior primary class from a trial operation to its current state, from instability to consolidation, and the continuous improvement of its teaching level, is inseparable from the help of the three teachers of the public Wuwen Complete Elementary School. For example, when the private senior primary class had difficulties with classrooms and dormitories, they took the initiative to vacate some rooms. At the beginning, the quality of the teachers in the private senior primary school was not high, and some courses could not be taught, so they took the initiative to adjust some of the teaching tasks with the private teachers. Some private teachers sometimes had financial difficulties because their salaries were paid late, and they took the initiative to advance food expenses. They lived and worked together with the private teachers, helping each other regardless of their status, and the private teachers were very grateful to them.
    However, according to the teachers, there are still some problems that need to be solved in this private primary school.
      First of all, private teachers urgently request that the education administrative department can strengthen its leadership over them, mainly ideological and professional leadership. This private senior primary school has been running for more than a year, but no one has ever been in charge of the teachers' ideology and professional skills, especially when they see the teachers in public primary schools receiving specific leadership, which increases their ideological distress.
    Secondly, due to insufficient publicity on the policy of private primary schools, there are still some vague understandings of private primary schools among the masses. Some parents have excessive demands on private schools, hoping that everything can be the same as public primary schools; some parents worry that their children will not be able to get into school after graduating from private schools;
  Individual parents are also unwilling to pay tuition fees, demanding that the state can come up with the money. Similarly, among teachers, because of insufficient understanding of the nature of private schools, they sometimes compare their treatment with that of public school teachers and are not at ease. Some people are afraid of being dismissed and do not work hard from the positive aspects of running the school well and improving the quality of teaching, which also affects the teaching work.
    Thirdly, since most farmers' economy is still not very well-off, tuition fees cannot be paid in full on time, and are often delayed, which sometimes affects the teachers' lives. However, this is only the case during the lean season. During the harvest season, most of the problems are solved.

### “吴文小学民办班”

　　“吴文小学民办班”
　　本报记者　高长任
    湖南省岳阳县荣家湾乡公城高级社，从1956年上学期开始，群众自己出钱，办了一所小学。这所民办高小附设在公立吴文小学里，现在它还没有正式的名称，人们只叫它“吴文小学民办班”。学生分两班，学的是五年级课程。
    领导这个民办高小的机构，是由家长代表和社干部组成的校政委员会。校政委员会负责筹集和开支经费、聘请教员、决定学校中的重大事项。现任的三位教员都是由校政委员会聘请的。
    经费来源，是每个学生每学期入学时交五元学费。这笔经费由校政委员会保存，陆续作教师工资和教学必需的费用。教师的工资，每月是二十四元到二十六元。
    据教师们谈，现在的教学内容与质量，都和公立高小是一致的。学生成绩很好，家长也很支持，对于继续办好这所民办高小，他们是有信心的。
    这所民办高小是在去年上半年开始试办的。当时只有三十九名学生，聘请的教员质量不高，有些课程教不下去。课堂设备也有许多困难。但是，在教师和农业社的帮助下，本着勤俭办学的精神，这些困难终于克服了。教室不够，就和农业社协商，借用农民业余学校的房子，白天学生上课，晚上农民学文化；缺少课桌，就在农民家里借几十条春凳来代替，坐凳则由学生从家中带来；缺少课本，一时也买不到，就由教师们到公立高小去借，借也借不到的，就暂时用油印印出来；有些路远的学生还要在学校寄宿，吴文小学就收拾一间旧楼房，稍加修理作为学生宿舍，用楼板、门板代替床铺。那时，一共只花四十多元的修建费，就把学生安顿下来了。
    这所民办高小班从试办到发展，由不巩固到巩固，教学水平能够不断提高，同公立吴文完全小学三位教师的帮助是分不开的。例如民办高小班教室宿舍困难，他们主动腾出一部分房子来；开始民办高小教师质量不高，有些课程教不下去，他们主动和民办教师调剂一部分教学任务；有的民办教师有时因薪资发的晚，经济上有困难，他们主动代垫伙食钱。他们和民办教师一起生活，一起工作，不分彼此地互相帮助，民办教师都很感谢他们。
    但是，据教师们谈，这所民办小学还有一些问题需要解决。
      首先是民办教师迫切要求教育行政部门能加强对他们的领导，主要是思想上和业务上的领导。这个民办高小办了一年多，但教师们的思想和业务却一直没有人管，特别是他们看到公立小学教师们得到具体领导，更增加了他们思想上的苦闷。
    其次，由于对民办小学的方针宣传不够，在群众中对民办小学还存在一些模糊的认识。有的家长对民办学校要求过高，希望一切都能和公立小学一样；有的家长耽心孩子在民办学校毕业，不好考学校；
  个别家长还不愿意交学费，要求国家能拿出钱来。同样，在教师中因为对民办的性质认识不足，有时和公立学校教师比待遇，不安心；有的人害怕自己会解聘，而不从办好学校、提高教学质量等积极方面努力，这对教学工作也是有影响的。
    再次，由于大部分农民经济还不是很宽裕的，学费不能按期缴齐，拖拖欠欠，有时候也影响教师的生活。但这只是青黄不接时的情况，到收获季节，大部分是不成问题的。
