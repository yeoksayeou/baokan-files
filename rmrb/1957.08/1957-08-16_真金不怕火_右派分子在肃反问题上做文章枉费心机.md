True Gold Fears No Fire
——Rightists' Attempts to Make an Issue of the Anti-Revolutionary Purge Are Futile
Foreign Trade Department Zhang Min

One of the main thrusts of the rightists' attack on the Party and socialism was to slander the great anti-revolutionary purge led by the Party, saying that the "anti-revolutionary purge was expanded" and that "wrongful imprisonments are everywhere"; and they advocated the establishment of a "Rehabilitation Committee" without the participation of the Communist Party to deal with these "wrongful cases." Rightists Yan Wenjie, Dong Shilian, and Li Taihua of the Ministry of Foreign Trade, in coordination with rightists in society, also launched such an attack on the Party.

Was the anti-revolutionary purge really messed up? Was the anti-revolutionary purge really expanded? The facts of the anti-revolutionary purge in the Ministry of Foreign Trade answer this question.

The anti-revolutionary purge in the Ministry of Foreign Trade lasted a full year. After arduous and meticulous investigation and research and fierce class struggle, a total of fifty-six counter-revolutionaries were identified in the Ministry of Foreign Trade. This was a major event. These counter-revolutionaries hid in various ways, some became false activists, and some climbed to leadership positions. But behind their backs, these counter-revolutionaries were doing unspeakable things, creating errors in their work, and undermining the foundations of socialism. In 1954, due to the activities of hidden counter-revolutionaries, the Ministry of Foreign Trade suffered 29 major sabotage accidents, with economic losses amounting to more than 10 million yuan, and the political losses were incalculable.

Among this group of counter-revolutionaries, some were active secret agents who had been lurking. Wang Tong, the administrator of the sanatorium of the Ministry of Foreign Trade, was such a person. He had served as a company commander and battalion commander in the Chiang army, and in 1950, he was introduced by Wang Huiyuan, a special agent of the "Pingjin Investigation Office" of the Chiang bandits' Internal Investigation Bureau lurking in Beijing, to join a special agent organization. After the American imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea, Wang Tong thought the time had come, and he actively developed counter-revolutionary organizations among former military officers together with Wang Huiyuan, and Wang Tong alone developed three special agents; and he established underground armed forces in an attempt to launch a riot. Another counter-revolutionary, Hou Zigong, used his convenience at work to create several sabotage accidents. On one occasion, he secretly changed the delivery date and variety of grinding tools ordered from abroad, resulting in a loss of more than 1,400 yuan, which affected the country's construction. Some also scribbled reactionary slogans and spread rumors in the agency. The above situation shows that before the anti-revolutionary purge, counter-revolutionaries were rampant within the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and it was only through the anti-revolutionary purge that this group of people was identified.

In addition, some counter-revolutionaries with bloody debts and great popular indignation, whom the people of various places had been searching for a long time, were also identified in this anti-revolutionary purge. For example, Feng Cangbo, an electrician in the General Office of the Ministry of Foreign Trade, was extremely brutal during his tenure as the chief of the Beijiao Branch of the Japanese puppet Beiping Police Bureau, and personally killed 29 of our revolutionary cadres and people. Feng committed crimes such as shooting to death the militia squad leader of Hancun Village in Mancheng with a pistol; stabbing to death the son and three-year-old grandson of Gao Luodan, who stored guns for the People's Liberation Army, with a bayonet; and poisoning 18 revolutionary cadres and others in a tunnel during a mopping-up operation in Donggou Village, Mancheng.

The rightists said: "No matter who it is, as long as the leader points a finger, they become the object of the anti-revolutionary purge and can be struggled against." "It's really a case of everyone being in danger, a great social terror"; and they said that the anti-revolutionary purge made some "good people" become listless and demoralized. This is completely shameless slander. Look at the facts: more than 5,000 employees of the Ministry of Foreign Trade participated in the anti-revolutionary purge, and only 321 people were politically reviewed, less than 7%. Among these 321 people, in addition to the 56 counter-revolutionaries, the others belonged to two categories: one category was officers above the rank of company commander, senior officials of the Chiang army who had committed crimes, and backbone members of reactionary parties and groups before 1946; or those who had made confessions in the past, but had not confessed thoroughly, or had new举报 material. In view of the fact that their crimes were not very serious, they were treated leniently in accordance with the policy of leniency for confession and severity for resistance, and were not regarded as counter-revolutionaries. For example, Liu Yaojin, chief of the section of the China National Machinery Import Corporation, served as the secretary and executive member of the Second District Branch of the Kuomintang Jinzhou City in 1945. During this period, he actively developed the organization and instructed Han Wenxi and others to distribute the reactionary "Letter to the Compatriots of Jinzhou City" and collect information on the activities of the People's Liberation Army. After starting work, he concealed the above problems and only confessed during the anti-revolutionary purge. The other category was those who were politically suspicious, and after review and conclusion, were identified as having general political and historical problems. Some concealed and fabricated their history, some had past contacts with special agents, and some had spread reactionary remarks. It was absolutely necessary to conduct a political review of these people. Before the review, it was difficult to distinguish their political concealment from the concealment of counter-revolutionaries, and it was difficult to distinguish their activities from the activities of counter-revolutionaries. During the review, the leadership of the Ministry of Foreign Trade adopted a very serious and cautious attitude, and sent hundreds of cadres to various parts of the country to conduct investigations and verifications. After their problems were clarified, on the one hand, their doubts were dispelled, and they could be used with confidence and boldness; on the other hand, after the actual education of the anti-revolutionary purge, the vast majority of them improved their awareness, unloaded their burdens, were relaxed and happy, and worked actively. Here is an example. Whether Li Zhifang, a cadre of the China National Transport Machinery Import Corporation, had committed bloody debts was an old problem, and for various reasons, a correct conclusion had not been reached. In this anti-revolutionary purge, in order to clarify this issue, the leadership of this company sent three special personnel to investigate and verify the situation. These three staff members traveled all over Shanghai, Hangzhou, Jinan, Nanjing and other places, and after countless investigations and verifications, it was confirmed that Li Zhifang had no bloody debts. Li Zhifang was deeply moved by this and grateful that the organization had clarified his old case of more than ten years. Since then, he has been active and responsible in his work, and in 1956, he received a material reward from the company for his achievements in work.

The benefits of the anti-revolutionary purge are not limited to these. After the anti-revolutionary purge, the unity within the agency was strengthened, the enthusiasm for work was improved, and the errors and accidents in work were greatly reduced. In short, a new atmosphere has emerged. The rightists are afraid that the world will not be in chaos, so they conduct unfounded slander, rumors and smears against the anti-revolutionary purge. But the facts give them the most powerful rebuttal.

Of course, this does not mean that the anti-revolutionary purge did not have some shortcomings. The shortcomings did exist. The Ministry of Foreign Trade had wrongly struggled against four people and wrongly arrested two people. In accordance with the principle of "must purge if there are counter-revolutionaries, must correct if there are mistakes," apologies were made to those who were wrongly struggled against and wrongly arrested, rehabilitation was carried out, and wages were reissued for the period of arrest. Another shortcoming was that three counter-revolutionaries were not identified in the anti-revolutionary purge and were only discovered after the anti-revolutionary purge. In short, we will never wrong a good person, nor will we let a counter-revolutionary escape.

    真金不怕火
    ——右派分子在肃反问题上做文章枉费心机
    对外贸易部  张敏
    右派分子向党、向社会主义进攻的主要矛头之一是大肆污蔑党所领导的伟大的肃反运动，说什么“肃反运动扩大化了”、“冤狱到处皆有”；并且主张成立没有共产党参加的“平反委员会”，来处理这些“冤案”。对外贸易部的右派分子严文杰、董士濂、李泰华配合社会上的右派分子，也向党作了这样的进攻。
    肃反运动真的搞糟了吗？肃反真的扩大化了吗？对外贸易部的肃反运动的事实回答了这个问题。
    对外贸易部的肃反运动整整地进行了一年。经过艰苦细致的调查研究和激烈的阶级斗争，对外贸易部总共清查出了五十六个反革命分子。这是一件大事。这些反革命分子，用各种各样的办法隐藏起来，有的当了假积极分子，有的爬上了领导岗位。但是这些反革命分子在背后却做着不可告人的勾当，制造工作中的差错，挖社会主义墙脚。1954年由于暗藏的反革命分子的活动，对外贸易部发生重大破坏事故二十九起，经济上损失达千余万元，政治上的损失更无法估计。
    在这批反革命分子中，有的是潜伏下来的现行特务。对外贸易部疗养所管理员王桐就是这样的人。他曾当过蒋军连长、营长，1950年还由潜伏在北京的蒋匪内调局“平津调查处”特务王惠远介绍参加特务组织。美帝国主义发动侵朝战争后，王桐以为时机到来，就与王惠远在旧军官中积极发展反革命组织，仅王桐一人就发展了三个特务；并且建立地下武装，企图发动暴乱。另一个反革命分子侯子功，利用工作中的方便，制造了几次破坏事故。其中有一次因为他偷改了向国外订购的研磨工具的交货日期和品种，就损失一千四百多元，并且因此影响了国家的建设。还有的在机关中涂写反动标语，散布谣言。以上情况，说明肃反之前，反革命分子在对外贸易部机关内部是十分猖獗的，通过肃反运动才把这批人清查出来。
    另有些是各地人民长久搜索不可得的血债累累、民愤很大的反革命分子，也在这次肃反中清查出来了。例如对外贸易部办公厅电工冯沧波，在任日伪北平警察局北郊分局警长期间，残暴至极，曾亲手杀害我革命干部和人民二十九人。冯犯曾用手枪打死满城韩村民兵班长；用刺刀刺死为解放军寄存枪枝的高洛丹的儿子和三岁的孙子；在满城东苟村扫荡时，亲手往地道里放毒，毒死革命干部等十八人。
    右派分子说：“不管什么人，只要领导上手指一下，就成肃反对象，就可斗。”“真是人人自危，社会大恐怖”；又说肃反运动把一些“好人”整得暮气沉沉，意志消沉。这完全是无耻谰言。请看事实：对外贸易部有五千多职工参加了肃反运动，在政治上受到审查的只有三百二十一人，不到7％。在这三百二十一人中，除了五十六个反革命分子外，其他的属于这样两类人：一类是有罪恶的蒋军连长以上的军官、高级官吏和1946年以前反动党团的骨干分子；或则是过去虽然作过交代，但交代得不彻底，或者有了新的检举材料。这类人鉴于他们的罪恶还不是十分严重，根据坦白从宽，抗拒从严的政策，从宽处理，而不以反革命分子论处。例如中国机械进口公司科长刘耀金，1945年任国民党锦州市第二区分部书记兼执行委员，在此期间积极发展组织，并指使韩文希等人散发反动的“告锦州市同胞书”，搜集解放军活动情况的情报。参加工作后隐瞒上述问题，在肃反中才作了交代。另一类是政治上有嫌疑，经过审查结论认定为一般政治历史问题的，有的隐瞒和伪造历史，有的与特务分子有过来往，有的散布过反动言论。对这些人进行一次政治审查是完全必要的。审查之前，很难把他们这些政治上的隐瞒与反革命分子隐瞒区别开来，很难把他们的活动和反革命分子的活动区分清楚。审查中，对外贸易部领导方面采取了非常严肃慎重的态度，派出了几百名干部分赴全国各地进行调查对证。在他们的问题弄清楚以后，一方面解除了对他们的怀疑，可以放心大胆的使用他们；另一方面，他们经过肃反运动的实际教育，绝大多数提高了觉悟，卸掉了包袱，轻松愉快，积极工作。这里可以举个例子。中国运输机械进口公司干部李志芳有没有血债是个老问题，由于各种原因，一直得不到正确的结论。在这次肃反中，为了搞清这个问题，这个公司的领导方面先后派出三个专人外出调查对证。这三个工作人员走遍上海、杭州、济南、南京等地，经过无数次的调查对证，证实了李志芳没有血债。李志芳为此深受感动，感激组织上把他十几年的旧案搞清楚了。从此以后在工作上积极负责，1956年因工作有成绩受到公司的物质奖励。
    肃反运动的好处还不只是这些，肃反运动以后，机关内部的团结增强了，工作积极性提高了，工作的差错事故大大减少了。总之，出现了一片新气象。右派分子是唯恐天下不乱，因而对肃反运动进行毫无根据的诽谤、造谣和污蔑。可是事实给予他们最有力的回击。
    当然，这决不是说，肃反运动没有一些缺点，缺点是有的。对外贸易部曾经错斗了四个人，错捕了两个人。根据“有反必肃，有错必纠”的方针，对错斗错捕的人进行了赔礼道歉，作了平反，并补发了被捕期间的工资。另外一个缺点是有三个反革命分子在肃反中未查出，肃反后才发现。总之，我们绝不冤枉一个好人，也绝不让一个反革命分子漏网。
