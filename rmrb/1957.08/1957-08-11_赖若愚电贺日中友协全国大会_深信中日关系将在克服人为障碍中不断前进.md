Xinhua News Agency, August 10th: Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, today sent a telegram to the Seventh National Convention of the Japan-China Friendship Association, extending congratulations on behalf of the Chinese workers.

The telegram stated, "In the years since the war, due to the common friendly aspirations of the peoples of China and Japan and their joint efforts, the friendly relations between the two peoples have continuously developed. We Chinese workers are very happy about this and express our admiration and respect for the efforts made by your association in promoting friendship between China and Japan.

What deeply saddens us is that recently, Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi has issued a series of very unfriendly remarks towards our country and has taken very unfriendly and insulting actions against our country. We Chinese workers have a great aversion to this. We believe that these unfriendly remarks and actions do not represent the wishes of the vast majority of the Japanese people.

I deeply believe that, through our joint efforts, the friendly relations between China and Japan will be able to continuously advance by overcoming various artificial obstacles.”

    赖若愚电贺日中友协全国大会
    深信中日关系将在克服人为障碍中不断前进
    新华社10日讯中华全国总工会主席赖若愚今天致电日中友好协会第七次全国大会，代表中国工人向大会表示祝贺。
    贺电中说，“战后几年来由于中日两国人民有着共同的友好愿望并且进行了共同的努力，两国人民之间的友好关系不断地有所发展。我们中国工人为此感到很高兴。对贵会在促进中日两国友好方面所作的努力，表示钦佩和敬意。
    令我们深深感到遗憾的是最近期间贵国首相岸信介先生发表了一连串对我国十分不友好的言论，并对我国采取了十分不友好的、侮辱性的行动。我们中国工人对此有极大的反感。我们认为这些不友好的言论和行动并不能代表日本广大人民的意愿。
    我深深地相信，通过我们的共同努力，中日两国的友好关系将能在克服各种人为的障碍中不断地向前迈进。”
