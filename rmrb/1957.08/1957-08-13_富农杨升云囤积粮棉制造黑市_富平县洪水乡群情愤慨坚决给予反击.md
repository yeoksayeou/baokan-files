(Our Dispatch from Xi'an, August 12th) On August 7th, Hongshui Township, Fuping County, Shaanxi Province, held a mass meeting of more than 2,400 people, exposing the activities of rich peasant Yang Shengyun in hoarding grain and undermining the state's grain policy. The masses at the meeting demanded that the government recover the grain and deal with this illegal rich peasant element according to the law.

Yang Shengyun has consistently undermined the state's grain policy, hoarding large quantities of grain, creating a grain black market, and also hoarding state-controlled commodities such as cotton, cooking oil, and salt. It has now been verified that he has hoarded more than 8,900 jin of old grain, including more than 5,000 jin of wheat, more than 2,000 jin of soybeans, and more than 1,000 jin of miscellaneous grains. In addition, there are 151 jin of lint cotton, more than 80 jin of cooking oil, more than 200 jin of cottonseed, and 110 jin of salt. Yang Shengyun also frequently bought grain at high prices. For example, after the summer harvest this year, he bought 300 jin of soybeans back in Miaogou Village at a price of 4 jiao per dou higher than the state price.

This rich peasant element, who hoarded large quantities of grain, also clamored everywhere that there was not enough grain to eat, and deliberately delayed paying the livestock feed that should be handed over to the agricultural cooperative. He resisted selling grain to the state, preferring to let a large amount of grain rot. Recently, among the grain seized from his home, more than 200 jin of wheat and 390 jin of barley had already rotted and deteriorated and were unfit for consumption.

Yang Shengyun not only hoarded a large number of state-controlled commodities but also frequently undermined the cooperative and satirized and attacked cadres. He rented the four thatched houses that were originally used to feed livestock to the agricultural cooperative as a feeding room, but often said to people, "The agricultural cooperative has taken my house, and there is not even a place to keep chickens."

In order to safeguard the state's policy of unified purchase and sale of grain and to educate the broad masses of peasants to recognize the ugly face of the reactionary elements, the Hongshui Township People's Committee held a reasoning struggle meeting of more than 2,400 people in the township on August 7th. Twenty-three agricultural cooperatives from neighboring townships also sent representatives to participate. At the meeting, the rotten grain and discolored cotton of illegal rich peasant Yang Shengyun were exhibited. After the meeting began, many peasants eagerly spoke. Poor peasant member Yu Jishan said: "Yang Shengyun, there is no one as bad as you in the world! You let the grain rot, and you don't sell it to the state or lend it to the peasants to eat." When Liu Jingchen, the director of Miaogou Agricultural Cooperative, exposed the fact that Yang Shengyun and illegal landlord Wang Tinghan and rich peasant Men Changfu from outside the cooperative secretly colluded to engage in black market speculation and hoard state-controlled commodities, it aroused even greater indignation among the masses, and everyone demanded that the government punish the illegal rich peasant Yang Shengyun according to law.

After the exposure and criticism by the broad masses, Yang Shengyun had no choice but to confess to illegal acts such as undermining the state's policy of unified purchase and sale of grain. According to the demands of the masses, the Fuping County People's Procuratorate arrested this reactionary rich peasant element according to law on August 9th.

    富农杨升云囤积粮棉制造黑市
    富平县洪水乡群情愤慨坚决给予反击
    本报西安12日电　8月7日，陕西富平县洪水乡召开了二千四百多人的群众大会，揭发了不法富农杨升云囤积粮食、破坏国家粮食政策的活动。到会的群众纷纷要求政府追回粮食，依法处理这个不法富农分子。
    杨升云一贯破坏国家粮食政策，大量囤积粮食，制造粮食黑市，还囤积棉花、食油、盐等统购物资。现在已经查对证实，他囤积了陈粮八千九百多斤，其中小麦五千多斤、黄豆二千多斤、杂粮一千多斤。此外，还有皮棉一百五十一斤、食油八十多斤、棉籽二百多斤和食盐一百一十斤。杨升云还经常以高价收买粮食。比如在今年夏收后，他以每斗高出国家牌价四角钱的价格，在庙沟村买回黄豆三百斤。
    这个囤积大量粮食的富农分子，还到处叫唤粮食不够吃，并故意拖欠应交给农业社的牲口饲料。他抗拒把粮食卖给国家，宁愿让大量粮食霉烂。最近从他家查出的粮食中，就有小麦二百多斤和大麦三百九十斤已经霉坏变质，不能食用。
    杨升云不仅大量囤积国家统购物资，还经常破坏合作社，讽刺打击干部。他把原来喂牲口的四间草房租给农业社做饲养室，却经常向人说，“农业社把我房占去了，连圈鸡的地方都没有了”。
    为了维护国家粮食统购统销政策和教育广大农民认清反动分子的丑恶面目，洪水乡人民委员会在8月7日召开了全乡二千四百多人的说理斗争大会。邻乡二十三个农业社，也选派了代表前来参加。会上展览了不法富农杨升云霉坏的粮食和变色的棉花等物。大会开始后，许多农民争先发言。贫农社员余吉山说：“杨升云，世上没有你这样坏的人！把粮食坏了，都不卖给国家，也不借给农民吃”。当庙沟农业社主任刘景臣揭发了杨升云和外社不法地主王廷汉、富农门长福等秘密合伙搞黑市投机、囤积国家统购物资的事实后，更激起了群众愤慨，大家要求政府依法惩办不法富农杨升云。
    经过广大群众的揭发和批判，杨升云不得不供认破坏国家粮食统购统销政策等违法事实，富平县人民检察院根据群众要求，在8月9日依法逮捕了这个反动的富农分子。
