　　We once again welcome Chairman Ho Chi Minh with excitement as he returns, laden with friendship, and passes through Beijing again.

　　Chairman Ho Chi Minh began his visit on July 6th, visiting nine socialist countries in Asia and Europe. Over nearly two months, he visited the capitals of these countries, toured their industrial and agricultural construction, and held talks with the party and government leaders of these countries. Chairman Ho Chi Minh's visit enhanced the mutual understanding between Vietnam and other socialist countries, further strengthened the solidarity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and contributed to the noble cause of safeguarding world peace. We express our heartfelt congratulations on the achievements of Chairman Ho's visit.

　　The foundation of friendship and solidarity between Vietnam and other socialist countries is Marxism-Leninism and the spirit of proletarian internationalism. During the years of the Vietnamese people's arduous resistance war, and during the period when the Vietnamese people were striving for the peaceful reunification and peaceful construction of their motherland, the people of all fraternal countries have consistently cared for, sympathized with, and supported the Vietnamese people, treating them as brothers and sisters, as close as family. This time, Chairman Ho, in his capacity as the head of state of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, personally informed the people of all fraternal countries about the situation of building the North and striving for the peaceful reunification of the country, and invited the leaders of the fraternal countries to visit the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. This will undoubtedly further consolidate and develop the friendship and solidarity between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and other socialist countries.

　　During this visit, the talks between Chairman Ho Chi Minh and the leaders of the fraternal countries fully demonstrated that Vietnam and other socialist countries have completely consistent views on many major international issues.

　　In a series of talks, everyone unanimously stated that it is necessary to further strengthen the solidarity of socialist countries, develop mutual friendship, and support each other in the cause of socialist construction; they are willing to work together to strive for the realization of the Soviet Union's disarmament proposals and to strive for the prohibition of the use and testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons. All fraternal countries unanimously support the demand put forward by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to take effective measures to implement the Geneva Accords.

　　Vietnam, Korea, and Germany are currently in a situation of being artificially divided. This shared situation and destiny makes them have a deeper sympathy and understanding for each other. In the talks between the national leaders of Vietnam and Korea, and Vietnam and Germany, they respectively condemned the US imperialism for undermining the Geneva Accords, obstructing the peaceful reunification of Vietnam, and attempting to drag South Vietnam into the Manila Treaty Organization; condemned the US imperialism for undermining the Korean Armistice Agreement, transporting new types of weapons into South Korea, and escalating the tension in Korea; condemned West Germany for joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, as well as West Germany's remilitarization and preparations for atomic warfare. All relevant countries unanimously believe that these activities of the imperialists are a serious obstacle to the unification of Vietnam, Korea, and Germany, and a serious threat to world peace. The relevant countries expressed mutual support for the efforts made to peacefully unify their own countries.

　　In the past three years, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has made great efforts to fully implement the Geneva Accords and promote the cause of peaceful reunification, and has repeatedly appealed to the South Vietnamese authorities, requesting to jointly discuss the major plan for realizing universal suffrage and unification. On June 8th and July 18th this year, Premier Pham Van Dong also successively wrote letters to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference and Ngo Dinh Diem, requesting strict implementation of the Geneva Accords and suggesting convening a consultative conference to discuss the issue of free universal suffrage. However, the South Vietnamese regime, with the support of the United States, unreasonably rejected all these suggestions and appeals. In order to turn South Vietnam into a military base for its aggression in Asia, the United States openly supports the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's various activities to split Vietnam. The United States uses a large amount of US "aid" and the dispatch of military personnel to train, arm, and expand the South Vietnamese army, and also tries its best to connect the South Vietnamese regime with the Southeast Asian aggressive group, using it to create tension in Asia. These actions of the United States cannot but arouse condemnation from peace-loving people all over the world.

　　The Chinese people express their heartfelt welcome to the achievements made by Chairman Ho Chi Minh's visit. We particularly note that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is located on the eastern front of the socialist camp, and Vietnam's independence, peace, democracy, and unification are of great significance to the entire socialist camp and the cause of world peace. As one of the signatory countries of the Geneva Accords, the Chinese people are indignant at the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's deliberate undermining of Vietnam's peaceful reunification under the instigation of US imperialism. We resolutely support the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's recently re-proposed demand for the implementation of the Geneva Accords, and resolutely support the Vietnamese people's desire to hold a consultative conference to discuss the realization of national unification through free universal suffrage.

### 向胡志明主席祝贺

　　向胡志明主席祝贺
    我们又一次怀着兴奋的心情，欢迎满载着友谊归来、再度经过北京的胡志明主席。
    胡志明主席从7月6日起程访问了亚洲和欧洲的九个社会主义国家，经过将近两个月的时间，遍访了这些国家的首都，参观了这些国家的工、农业建设，并分别和这些国家的党政领导人举行了会谈。胡志明主席的这次访问，增进了越南和其他社会主义国家的相互了解，进一步加强了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，并有助于维护世界和平的崇高事业。我们对胡主席这次访问所获得的成就表示衷心的祝贺。
    越南和其它社会主义国家友谊团结的基础，是马克思列宁主义，是无产阶级国际主义精神。在越南人民艰苦抗战的年月，在越南人民争取祖国的和平统一与和平建设的时期，各兄弟国家人民和越南人民，一贯地互相关怀、同情和支持，情同手足，亲如家人。这次胡主席以越南民主共和国元首的身份，亲自把越南建设北方和争取国家和平统一斗争的情况，告诉各兄弟国家的人民，并邀请各兄弟国家的领导人到越南民主共和国访问。这无疑地将会使越南民主共和国和其他社会主义国家的友谊和团结获得进一步的巩固和发展。
    在这次访问中，胡志明主席与兄弟国家党和政府领导人的会谈，充分表明越南和其它社会主义国家对目前许多重大的国际问题的看法是完全一致的。
    在一系列的会谈中，大家一致表示：要进一步加强社会主义国家的团结，发展彼此的友谊，在社会主义建设事业中相互支援；愿意共同努力争取实现苏联的裁军建议，争取禁止原子武器和氢武器的使用和试验。各兄弟国家都一致支持越南民主共和国政府提出的希望采取有效措施来实现日内瓦协定的要求。
    越南、朝鲜和德国目前都处于被人为地分裂的境况。这种共同的处境和命运，使它们相互间更具有深刻的同情和了解。在越朝和越德国家领导人的会谈中，分别谴责了美帝国主义破坏日内瓦协定，阻挠越南的和平统一以及企图把南越拉进马尼拉条约组织的阴谋活动；谴责了美帝国主义破坏朝鲜停战协定，把新型武器运进南朝鲜，加剧朝鲜的紧张局势；谴责了西德参加北大西洋公约组织以及西德的重新军国主义化和原子战争的准备。各有关国家一致认为，帝国主义者的这些活动，是越南、朝鲜和德国的统一的严重障碍，是世界和平的严重威胁。各有关国家表示互相支持为了和平统一自己的国家所作的努力。
    三年来，为了彻底实现日内瓦协定和促进和平统一的事业，越南民主共和国曾经作了巨大的努力，并多次向南越当局呼吁，要求共商实现普选和统一的大计。今年6月8日和7月18日，范文同总理还相继写信给日内瓦会议的两位主席和吴庭艳，要求严格履行日内瓦协定，并建议召开协商会议，讨论自由普选问题。但是，南越政权在美国的支持下，却对这些建议和呼吁一概加以无理拒绝。美国为了把南越变成它在亚洲进行侵略的军事基地，公开支持吴庭艳集团分裂越南的各种活动。美国用大量的美“援”和派遣军事人员等办法，来训练、武装和扩充南越的军队，还竭力促使南越政权同东南亚侵略集团联系起来，利用它在亚洲制造紧张局势。美国这些行为，不能不引起全世界爱好和平人民的谴责。
    中国人民对胡志明主席这次访问所取得的成就表示衷心的欢迎。我们特别注意到，越南民主共和国处在社会主义阵营的东方前线，越南的独立、和平、民主和统一对于整个社会主义阵营和世界的和平事业具有重要的意义。作为日内瓦协定签字国之一，中国人民对于吴庭艳集团在美帝国主义指使下蓄意破坏越南和平统一感到愤慨，我们坚决支持越南民主共和国最近再次提出的实现日内瓦协定的要求，坚决支持越南人民要求举行协商会议讨论通过自由普选实现国家统一的愿望。
