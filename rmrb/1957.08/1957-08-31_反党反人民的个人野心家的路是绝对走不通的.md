    The Path of Anti-Party and Anti-People Individual Ambitionists is Absolutely Impassable
    Ba Jin
    The recent exposure of the Ding Ling and Chen Qixia anti-Party clique shocked me greatly. Ding Ling actually repeated her mistakes and stubbornly insisted on following her destructive old path! Some people in the literary and art circles knew something about the past activities of this clique. A year and a half ago, I heard that Ding Ling had recognized her mistakes, bowed her head in submission, and was determined to "settle down among the masses" and write works beneficial to the people. On the one hand, I felt that the Party was lenient towards her, and on the other hand, I believed that she had embarked on the bright road from then on. In March of this year, I saw her at the creation planning meeting held by the Writers Association. On the day before I left Beijing after the meeting, Jin Yi, Luo Sun, and I visited her and invited her to write for "Harvest." During the conversation, she suddenly mentioned the name Lin Xiling, praising this girl as remarkable. Among the three guests, only I had received a copy of Lin Xiling's mimeographed "indictment" (draft), which I had quickly glanced through. Of course, I didn't know that Lin Xiling would later be a rightist, but I always felt that this girl had a bit of a showy and deceptive style. I didn't refute Ding Ling's opinion at the time, but I felt a sense of grievance and dissatisfaction in her words. I seemed to catch a glimpse of the dark side of her soul. Therefore, I secretly thought that the transformation of intellectuals was indeed not an easy task, and she seemed not to be willing to confess her guilt. But I didn't think of anything else. Jin Yi and Luo Sun had the same feeling. However, we still believed that she had been working hard on her creation, and we were still waiting to read her works. It was not until I read the shocking news recently that I realized that she was not writing a novel behind closed doors, but was engaging in that unspeakable anti-Party conspiracy. It turned out that she had not embarked on the bright road, but had entered a dark dead end. When she admired and praised Lin Xiling, she had already overturned her past self-criticism and was carrying out "reversal of verdicts" activities. She never recognized her mistakes. She just used flowery words to muddle through, waited for the opportunity, and made a comeback. Moreover, she also preserved her small clique as her capital for a comeback. She thought the opportunity had come. This time, she came back not only to "reverse the verdict," but also to usurp the leadership of literature and art. Who knew that the moment she was carried away with pride was also the moment she revealed her true colors. She may have thought that this was the result of being overly optimistic and blindly reckless, but in fact, even if she racked her brains and exhausted her efforts, she would only end up in a dead end. The path of anti-Party and anti-people individual ambitionists is absolutely impassable.
    After the news of the exposure of the Ding and Chen anti-Party clique was published in Shanghai newspapers, not only the literary and art circles, but people from all walks of life were excitedly discussing this major event. Many people regretted Ding Ling and were very surprised that a writer with international reputation would degenerate to the point of being willing to lie in the anti-Party and anti-people mud pit. Some people also asked me: Why is a writer like Ding Ling, who is so valued and has such a high status, still not satisfied? Why doesn't she concentrate on her creation and instead engage in such ugly activities? In fact, people who have had more contact with Ding Ling will know that she did not accidentally fall into the mud pit. There is a very dark thing in her soul, that is, the ambition of "I am the literary world" and the domineering style of "I am the only one" that Comrade Lao She mentioned. She does not recognize that literature is the cause of the Party and the cause of the people. She does not understand that any good literary work is the crystallization of collective wisdom. She regards literary works as personal private property. Therefore, she advocates "one-book-ism," thinking that a person who has a book has everything, including fame and fortune. She regards writing as a tool for individuals to pursue fame and fortune, so she is not satisfied with the glorious title of "engineer of the human soul," and she is not grateful for the Party's attention and the people's respect. She wants power! And she wants even greater power! She also wants more and greater fame and fortune. She thought that she should have everything after writing "The Sun Shines on the Sanggan River." If she couldn't get it, she would fight for it. If she couldn't fight for it, she would "steal" ① and engage in conspiracies to usurp it. Being a great writer is not enough to satisfy her desires. She wants to lead others, and she cannot be led by others. She wants to "rule alone" in the literary world, and she cannot sit with writers on an equal footing. She wants to do this kind of shameful "stealing" activity, so she engages in anti-Party cliques to realize her conspiracy plans. What is strange is that there are still some "writers" who are willing to listen to her command, give her ideas, and run errands for her, and finally push her into the mud pit. Today, in the eyes of the people of the whole country, Ding Ling is no longer a "soul engineer." Her face is covered with mud, and she is rolling in the stinky water. Whether she is crying sincerely or pretending to cry, or making a "lyrical monologue," she cannot hide her disgusting ugliness. Lying down and rolling around will only make her sink deeper and deeper. She has no way out. The only way out is to get out of the mud pit, bow her head and confess her guilt to the people, and honestly and thoroughly explain everything. Endure the pain to dig out the dark and ugly things in your soul. The harder you dig, the deeper you dig, the better! All the dark and ugly things must be dug out, dug out completely, before you can be a new person, be a veritable "soul engineer," and be a writer who does not seek fame or fortune but serves the people wholeheartedly.
    Regardless of whether Ding Ling is willing to confess thoroughly, the Ding and Chen anti-Party clique will definitely be defeated. No small cliques can be allowed to exist in the literary and art circles of New China. As a writer, one must link one's personal career with the collective cause, and one's personal destiny with the collective destiny. Leaving the Party and the people to find another way out, no matter how famous the writer is, even Ding Ling, will be abandoned by the people, because she has already cut herself off from the people.

    反党反人民的个人野心家的路是绝对走不通的
    巴金
    最近丁玲、陈企霞反党集团的揭露使我大吃一惊。丁玲竟然一错再错执迷不悟地坚持走她的毁灭的老路了！关于这个集团过去的活动文艺界中有一部分人也多少知道一点。一年半前，我听说，丁玲已经认识到自己的错误，低头伏罪，决心到“群众中去落户”，要写出对人民有益的作品。我一方面感到党对她的宽大，一方面也认为她从此走上了光明大道。今年3月，我在作协召开的创作规划会议上见到她，会后离开北京的前一天，我和靳以、罗荪去访问她，并约她给“收获”写稿。在谈话中她忽然提起林希翎这个名字，夸奖这个女孩子如何了不起。我们三个客人中间只有我收到过一份林希翎的油印的“控诉书”（草稿），匆匆翻阅了一遍。我自然不知道林希翎以后会是一个右派分子，但是我总觉得这个女孩子有点招摇撞骗的作风。我当时没有反驳丁玲的意见，不过我从她这些话里感到一种受委屈的不满情绪。我仿佛瞥见了她的灵魂的阴暗面。我因此暗想知识分子的改造的确不是容易的事，她好像并非甘心认罪似的。但是我也不曾想到其他。靳以和罗荪也有这同样的感觉。不过我们还认为她一直在埋头创作，我们还等着读她的作品。一直到最近读到那个令人震惊的消息，才知道她关着门不是在写小说，却是在干那不可告人的反党的阴谋活动。原来她并没有走上光明大道，却走进了阴暗的死胡同。她欣赏、称赞林希翎的时候，她已经推翻了自己过去的检讨，在进行“翻案”的活动了。她始终没有认识自己的错误，她不过用花言巧语，蒙混过关，等待时机，卷土重来。而且她还保存了她这个小集团，作为她重来的资本。她认为现在机会来了。她这次重来，不仅“翻案”，而且要篡夺文艺领导权。谁知她得意忘形的时候也正是她现出原形的时候。她也许以为这是过分乐观、盲目冒进的后果，其实即使她处心积虑、挖空心思也只有死路一条。反党、反人民的个人野心家的路是绝对走不通的。
    揭露丁、陈反党集团的消息在上海报纸上发表后，不仅文艺界，各阶层的人都在激动地谈论这件大事。不少的人为丁玲惋惜，很奇怪一个有国际声誉的作家会堕落到甘愿躺在反党、反人民的泥坑里面。还有人问我：像丁玲这样受重视、有地位的作家，还有什么不满足？她为什么不安心创作，还要去搞那种丑恶的勾当？其实跟丁玲有过较多接触的人，就会知道她并不是偶然失脚掉进泥坑里去的。她的灵魂里有一个非常阴暗的东西，那就是老舍同志所说的“朕即文坛”的野心和“唯我独尊”的恶霸作风。她不承认文学是党的事业，人民的事业。她不了解任何一部好的文学作品都是集体智慧的结晶。她把文学作品看成个人私有的财富。所以她提倡“一本书主义”，以为一个人有了一本书就有了一切，自然也包括了名和利。她把写作看作个人追求名利的工具，所以对于“人类灵魂工程师”这个光荣称号她并不满意，对于党的重视和人民的尊敬她也并不感激。她还要权！而且要更大的权！她还要更多更大的名利。她以为她写了一本“太阳照在桑乾河上”她就应该有一切，得不到的她就争，争不到的她就“偷”①，就搞阴谋来篡夺。做一个大作家还不能满足她的欲望。她要领导别人，她不能受人领导。她要在文坛上“称孤道寡”，不能够平等地跟作家们坐在一起，她要干这种见不得人的“偷盗”勾当，所以就搞反党小集团来实现她的阴谋计划。奇怪的是居然还有一些“作家”甘心听她指挥，替她出主意，为她奔走，最后把她抬到泥坑里去。今天在全国人民的眼睛里，丁玲不再是一个“灵魂的工程师”了。她满脸污泥，躺在臭水里面打滚，不管她真哭假哭也好，作“抒情的独白”也好，她掩饰不了她那令人厌恶的丑态。老是躺着打滚，只有使她越陷越深。她并没有出路。唯一的出路就是从泥坑里走出来，向人民低头认罪，老老实实地彻底交代。忍着痛去挖自己灵魂里的阴暗、丑恶的东西，越用力挖，越挖得深，越好！要把所有阴暗的、丑恶的东西全挖出来，挖干净了，才好重新作人，作一个名副其实的“灵魂的工程师”，做一个并不为名为利而是全心全意为人民服务的作家。
    不管丁玲肯不肯彻底交代，丁、陈的反党集团是一定会打垮的。在新中国的文艺界中不能允许有任何小集团存在。作为一个作家必须把个人的事业跟集体的事业、个人的命运跟集体的命运连在一起，离开了党和人民另找出路，不管是有着多大声誉的作家，哪怕是丁玲罢，也会为人民唾弃，因为她已经自绝于人民了。
