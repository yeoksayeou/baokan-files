On the Anti-Rightist Front

    A Small Group of Monsters and Demons in Lanzhou's Journalism Circle
    (Our dispatch) The Lanzhou branch of the Journalists Association held a joint debate and struggle meeting today to criticize a small group of monsters and demons in Lanzhou's journalism and publishing circles. They are Yuan Yuchang, staff member of the Lanzhou Daily Preparatory Office, Wang Jingchao and Yang Rao of the Gansu Daily editorial department, and Wang Da, director of the program department of Gansu People's Broadcasting Station.
    Yuan Yuchang once slandered that it was a "hegemony" for party members to take leadership positions in the Party newspaper. When the People's Daily published the editorial "What is the Reason?", he stepped forward and wrote an article "A Word to the People's Daily" to provide cover for the rampant attacks of the rightists. He also clamored for a "national public opinion test."
    Rightist elements Wang Jingchao and Yang Rao formed an anti-Party "black gang". He wrote three essays cursing leading cadres as "old qualifications make them feel content and full, to the point of being impenetrable," and slandered the Party's promotion of "blind loyalty and filial piety." After the anti-Rightist struggle began, he turned around and accused the Party of "openly threatening to block the channels of expression."
    Wang Da is a probationary member of the Chinese Communist Party. During the rectification campaign, in his capacity as a "Party member" and "full-time anti-rebellion cadre", he incited key figures of the anti-rebellion movement to "appeal for justice and seek revenge" against leading cadres.

### 兰州新闻界一小撮魑魅魍魉

    兰州新闻界一小撮魑魅魍魉
    本报讯　今天，新闻工作者协会兰州分会召开联合说理斗争会，批判兰州新闻出版界的一小撮魑魅魍魉。他们是兰州日报筹备处的工作人员袁玉昌、甘肃日报编辑部的王景超、杨饶和甘肃人民广播电台节目部主任王达。
    袁玉昌曾经诬蔑党员担任党报的领导工作是“王霸业”。当人民日报发表“这是为什么”的社论时，他就挺身而出，写了一篇“给人民日报进一言”的稿件，为右派分子的猖狂进攻打掩护。他还叫嚣来一次“全国民心大测验”。
    右派分子王景超和杨饶等组成反党“黑社”，他写了三篇杂文咒骂领导干部“老资格使他们心饱肚塞，几乎到了滴水不进的程度”，诬蔑党提倡“愚忠愚孝”。在反右派斗争开始后，他又反咬党是“公然威胁，以塞言路”。
    王达是中共预备党员，在整风期间，以“党员”和“肃反专职干部”身份，煽动肃反重点分子向领导干部“申冤报仇”。
