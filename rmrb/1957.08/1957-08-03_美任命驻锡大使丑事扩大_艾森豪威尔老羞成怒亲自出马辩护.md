Xinhua News Agency, 2nd August: Washington Dispatch: The storm surrounding the appointment of the U.S. Ambassador to Ceylon, Gluck, has intensified. On August 1st, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee demanded that the State Department explain the government's policy on appointing ambassadors.

During a recent discussion of Gluck's appointment in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Gluck was unable to answer senators' questions about the names of the Prime Ministers of Ceylon and India. Despite this, the Foreign Relations Committee approved his appointment, which was later approved by the Senate. During questioning in the Senate, Gluck mentioned that he had donated money to the Republican Party in the 1952 and 1956 elections.

The Associated Press reported on August 1st that Ceylonese people are lodging strongly worded protests about Gluck's appointment, considering it an insult to Ceylon.

Undersecretary of State Herter testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday about Gluck's appointment and was questioned by senators for two and a half hours. Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Green said that he believes "Gluck should not have been nominated in the first place, I don't think he is qualified." But Herter said he "still believes that Gluck can be a very good ambassador."

U.S. President Eisenhower also defended Gluck at a press conference on July 31st, and when reporters raised the issue of Gluck donating money to the Republican Party, he appeared enraged and turned red in the face. He said that someone with Gluck's achievements in "business" (he is the owner of one hundred and forty women's clothing stores) would definitely be able to familiarize himself with the situation in Ceylon and his duties.

Gluck said on the same day that he is spending ten hours a day at the State Department familiarizing himself with the situation in Ceylon, but is still barely able to remember the name of the Prime Minister of Ceylon.

Given the escalating situation, Republican newspapers are advising Gluck to "find a graceful way to resign."

    美任命驻锡大使丑事扩大
    艾森豪威尔老羞成怒亲自出马辩护
    新华社2日讯　华盛顿消息：围绕着美国驻锡兰大使格拉克的任命问题而引起的风波，已经愈演愈大，参议院外交委员会8月1日要求国务院解释政府任命大使的政策。
    在参议院外交委员会最近讨论格拉克的任命时，格拉克竟然回答不出参议员向他询问的锡兰总理和印度总理的名字。尽管如此，外交委员会还是批准了他的任命，并且在后来得到参议院的同意。在参议院回答问题时，格拉克谈到他在1952年和1956年的两次大选中曾经向共和党捐了钱。
    美联社在8月1日报道说，锡兰人正在就格拉克的任命提出措词强硬的抗议，认为这个任命是对锡兰的一个侮辱。
    副国务卿赫脱昨天在参议院外交委员会就格拉克的任命作证时受到参议员两小时半的盘问。外交委员会主席格林说，他认为“当初不应该提名格拉克，我认为他不够条件”。但是赫脱说他“仍旧相信格拉克能够成为一个很好的大使”。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔在7月31日的记者招待会上也替格拉克辩护，而且在新闻记者提出格拉克向共和党捐钱的问题时，表现得激怒了，而且脸红起来。他说，像格拉克那样在“事业上”有成就的人（他是一百四十家妇女服装店的老板），一定能够熟悉锡兰的情况和他的职责。
    格拉克在同一天说，他正在每天花十小时的时间在国务院熟悉锡兰的情况，但还是刚刚能够背出锡兰总理的名字。
    鉴于事情愈演愈大，共和党报纸正奉劝格拉克“找一个体面的方式辞职。”
