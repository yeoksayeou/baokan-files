    国际青年运动走向更广泛合作的里程碑
    世界青联代表大会在基辅开幕
    据新华社基辅16日电  第四届世界民主青年联盟代表大会16日在乌克兰共和国首都基辅开幕。
    这次会议将成为国际民主青年运动走向更广泛合作的一个重要里程碑。在大会上，世界民主青年联盟主席柏尼尼将向代表大会作关于“今日的青年和世界民主青年联盟的任务”的报告，联盟总书记德尼将作关于世界青年联盟新盟章的报告。会议将对这两个报告进行讨论，并且确定出今后世界青年联盟的方针、任务和通过新盟章。
    在保卫和平和青年利益的基础上和各国青年组织进行广泛的合作，这是第四届世界民主青年联盟代表大会注意的中心问题。这次大会邀请了各种不同政治倾向的青年组织参加，请他们表示自己的看法。在出席大会的五百名代表中有三分之一是一百三十多个不是世界青年联盟会员的青年组织派来的观察员。其中，有南斯拉夫、印度、日本和南美洲国家的青年组织的代表。一直不肯和世界青年联盟合作的世界青年大会所属的一些青年组织也派来了观察员。
    大会将研究各国青年组织进行合作的形式。据柏尼尼主席在大会开幕前夕对记者说，在这次大会上，任何青年组织都可以彼此接触和发起创议讨论共同感兴趣的问题，或者签订双边协定。世界青年联盟欢迎各种不同政治倾向的青年组织参加它的活动。
