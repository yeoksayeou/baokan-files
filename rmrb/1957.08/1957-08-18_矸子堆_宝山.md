    Gangue Pile - A Treasure Mountain
    Six or seven years ago, when I went to Tangshan for an interview, I saw a gangue "mountain" in the city center. It was barren, with no grass growing, and the wind blew dust everywhere. It hindered traffic and was detrimental to hygiene. Recently, when I went to Tangshan again, I saw that the mountain had changed. Its southern and northern sides had been stripped of their black surface, revealing the red gangue. At the foot of the mountain, trucks and rubber-wheeled carts transporting gangue were coming and going in a constant stream.

    This gangue mountain was accumulated by Kailuan Coal Mine over the past fifty or sixty years. The gangue contains a large amount of sulfur and can combust spontaneously. Therefore, it reeked when it was first piled up, and there was a danger of explosion. Thirty years ago, Dr. Ma of Kailuan Hospital and his family of seven died in a gangue explosion. When the British ruled Kailuan, they hired people to plant most of the trees, but most of them were scorched to death like ants on a hot pan.

    The idea of using gangue as a raw material for cement was proposed by Zhao Yanqing, deputy director of the laboratory of Qixin Cement Company. In 1952, when he went to Beijing to attend a meeting for laboratory personnel, he heard the superiors introduce the benefits of using mixed materials according to the purpose of the cement, as proposed by Soviet expert Mikhailiude. He thought that the reserves of this material should be large, and it should be convenient to transport. He racked his brains to find a solution and ran to power plants and steel plants but could not find this mixed material. Finally, he remembered that during the period of Japanese puppet rule, someone used gangue to build an airport. He thought: Since fly ash from power plants can be used as a mixed material, why can't self-combusted gangue be used as a mixed material? His experiments proved that it fully met the national requirements for specifications, which could not only increase production and reduce costs by several tens of percent, but also improve product quality. Therefore, from 1954, he proposed the use of gangue as a mixed material.

    In this year's increase production and practice economy campaign, Qixin Cement Plant regarded increasing the proportion of mixed materials as an important measure to increase production and practice economy. In the first quarter, after many bold experiments, it was proved that increasing the amount of mixed materials was completely possible while ensuring the national required product quality standards. In the second quarter, the plant saved more than 1,810 tons of cement clinker than in the first quarter and completed the semi-annual plan five days ahead of schedule.

    Zhao Yanqing happily told me: "It's a real coincidence that Qixin is close to a large coal mine like Kailuan, which supplies us with the most ideal mixed material. The pile in the city center alone has more than one million tons, plus other mines, there are four to five million tons of gangue on the ground alone, enough for our factory to use for fifty or sixty years." I said to him: "I heard that in four or five years, after the gangue mountain in the city center is flattened, a stadium will be built there!" ·Yu Yaofu·

    矸子堆——宝山
    六、七年前我去唐山采访的时候，看见市中心有一座矸子“山”，光秃秃寸草不生，风吹过尘土飞扬。既妨碍交通，又不利卫生。最近我到唐山，看见那座山已经变了样，它的南边和北边已被剥去黑色的表皮，红色的矸石露出来了。山脚下，运矸子的汽车、胶轮车络绎不绝。
    这座矸子山是开滦煤矿过去五、六十年间堆积起来的。矸子里含有大量硫磺，能够自己燃烧。因此刚一堆上的时候臭气熏人，并有爆炸的危险。三十年前，开滦医院的马大夫一家七口人就是在矸子爆炸中死去的。英国人统治开滦的时候，曾雇人种了大部树木，但是大部分像热锅上的蚂蚁一样被烫死了。
    把矸子当成水泥原料是启新水泥公司化验室副主任赵岩青提出来的。他在1952年到北京开化验人员会议的时候，听到上级介绍了苏联专家米哈依流德提出的按水泥用途掺用混合材料的好处。他想，这种材料的储备量应当大，运输起来应当方便。他绞尽脑汁想办法，跑了电厂、钢厂都找不到这种混合材料，最后想起在日伪统治时期，有人用矸子修飞机场。他想：既然电厂的炉灰可以当混合材料，为什么自己燃烧过的矸子不能当混合材料呢？他试验的结果证明，完全合乎国家要求的规格，不仅可以增加产量和降低成本好几成，而且能提高产品质量。因此，从1954年起，他就提出用矸子做混合材料的建议。
    在今年的增产节约运动中，启新水泥厂把提高混合材料比例作为增产节约的一个重要措施。在第一季度里，经过多次的大胆试验，证明在保证国家要求的产品质量标准下，增加混合材料用量是完全可以的。这个厂在第二季度就比第一季度多节约水泥熟料一千八百一十多吨，提前五天完成了上半年计划。
    赵岩青愉快地告诉我：“真凑巧，启新靠近开滦这样的大煤矿，它供给了我们最理想的混合材料，市中心那一堆就约有一百万吨以上，加上其他矿的，仅地面的矸子就有四五百万吨，足够我们厂使用五六十年。”我对他说：“我听说再过四五年市中心的矸子山削平之后，还要在那里修一个体育场呢！”        ·余药夫·
