　　During the Solar Eclipse
　　(Fable – Proposed Animation Script)
　　Zhang Ming

　　On this day, as on any day since time immemorial, the sun tirelessly journeys through the cosmos. On the earth, vegetation thrives, a myriad of flowers exude fragrance, newborn lambs frolic in the meadows, pike leap and play in the streams, turtledoves passionately sing their courtship songs, and tiny beetles on blades of grass groom their antennae with their tiny legs...

　　Suddenly, the moon, which cannot emit light and is without life, moves between the earth and the sun, becoming a dark spot, obscuring the sun's brilliance.

　　The earth is instantly dimmed and desolate.

　　Thus, a commotion arises among many creatures.

　　A clump of reeds by the riverbank is blown back and forth by the wind, desperately swaying its slender waist and waving its delicate arms, shouting in terror:

　　"It's terrible! The sun is going to be destroyed, the end of the world is here! What shall we do? Where shall we go? Where shall we escape?"

　　Beside her, a white crane stands on one leg on a rock, its long beak tucked under its wing, its eyes half-open and half-closed, listless. The reed's exclamation awakens him from his dreamlike state. He raises his long neck and shouts at the reed:

　　"Silence! You disturb my contemplation!"

　　"What a world, and you are still contemplating!" the reed mutters under her breath.

　　"I am experiencing the greatest disillusionment of my life!" the white crane says with a sigh. "I have lived for thousands of years. When I was young, I was naive. I worshipped the heavens, respected the earth, and loved the ten suns in the sky. But later, the sky tilted to the northwest, and the earth sank to the southeast, killing countless living beings; and the ten suns scorched the land for thousands of miles, leaving no vegetation. Since then, I have believed that there is nothing good between heaven and earth, and I believe in nothing. Later, since Nuwa repaired the sky, and Hou Yi shot down the nine fake sun-crows, leaving one sun shining on all things, these years have been orderly with the seasons, and the five grains have been abundant. Thus, I gradually developed a sense of reverence for this sun. I often flew to the East Sea before dawn to greet the fiery red sunrise, paying homage and praising him. But I never expected today..." The white crane was too saddened to continue.

　　"What's wrong? Do you need to rest for a while?" the reed asks with concern.

　　The white crane steadies himself and continues:

　　"I never expected today that a black spot would grow on the sun, making it unrecognizable! I loved him, but how can I maintain my faith and respect for him like this? I am disillusioned again! And this time it is more tragic than ever before!" The white crane sadly shook his head and closed his long beak, preparing to tuck it back into his feathers.

　　"Then what do you plan to do in the future?" the reed asks.

　　"In the future, I will believe in nothing!" the white crane says resolutely. "You know I have a cleanliness obsession, I cannot tolerate any minor flaws. Since he has a black spot, he is not worthy to be the sun!"

　　"Without the sun, how can we survive?" the reed asks worriedly.

　　The white crane could not answer this. Just then, a firefly flew out of the woods and answered the question. The firefly warmly comforted the reed, saying:

　　"Don't worry, you can survive without the sun! Look at me, don't I also emit light?"

　　As he spoke, he raised his lower abdomen, held his breath, and used all his strength to emit some faint green light. Sure enough, his light illuminated the plants, trees, soil, and rocks in front of him, and he excitedly announced loudly:

　　"I can completely replace the sun! I, I am the sun!"

　　Before he could finish speaking, an owl suddenly darted out of a cave, flapping its wings and knocking the firefly to the ground, then scolding fiercely:

　　"Get out of here, we don't need any sun!"

　　Then, facing the sun, he let out a chilling laugh:

　　"Haha! You hateful sun! Your day has come! You forced me into the cave, living in hiding, suffering in misery. Now it's my turn to have my day!"

　　Then he flew up to the high treetop and shouted sharply:

　　"All living things on earth, listen: You have all seen the black spot on the sun with your own eyes, haven't you? In fact, his crimes are far more than these. Think about how he usually acts arrogantly and tyrannically, poisoning living beings. How many good people has he killed with his ultraviolet rays? Can we still tolerate it? He is not good, we must overthrow him, kill him! Don't be superstitious about him. Without him, the world will not perish. We wholeheartedly welcome the God of Darkness to be the master of the earth! Let us all shout: Long live the God of Darkness!"

　　The owl's incitement did not receive a response, but instead provoked a burst of angry jeers:

　　"The 'good people' you're talking about are the bacteria on corpses, right?"

　　"Stop singing high-sounding tunes, we know you!"

　　"Down with the God of Darkness!"

　　The reed also grumbled with dissatisfaction: "I don't care about anything else, I only know that I can't live without the sun!"

　　The white crane looked around anxiously.

　　The firefly struggled to get up.

　　At this moment, a golden rooster on the hillside crowed loudly. He was accustomed to making such calls before dawn, helping the sun to defeat the darkness. Now he sang enthusiastically again:

　　"Sun, sun!
　　Fountain of life,
　　Light of the universe,
　　Quickly use your heat,
　　Quickly use your light,
　　Burn away that dark spot,
　　Don't let it obscure your brilliance!" ...

　　While all this was happening on the earth, the eclipsed sun heard and saw everything clearly. From this, he received encouragement, strength, and also a warning. So he exerted the power of every cell in his body, and with a mighty shake, burst forth with a blazing fire, shooting out in all directions, illuminating the cosmos red! In an instant, that dark spot was burned to ashes, vanished into nothingness. An even brighter, warmer, fresher, and younger sun emerged from the boundless firmament!

　　In the sun's dazzling brilliance, the reed and the white crane rubbed their eyes and gradually understood: "Oh! This was just a solar eclipse!" The firefly blushed and thought to himself: "To be honest, my light is a bit inferior to the sun's." As for that owl who could not bear the light of day, he was blinded by the sun's first ray of strong light and fell from the high branch.

　　On the earth, it was again a bright spring day, a scene of blooming flowers. All things grew vigorously in the warm sunshine.

    当日蚀的时候
    （寓言——拟动画片脚本）
    章明
    这一天，同亘古以来任何一天一样，太阳在宇宙太空奋力运行。大地上，草木欣欣向荣，百花吐露芬芳，初生的羊羔在草地上打滚，梭子鱼在小河里跳跃嬉戏，斑鸠热烈地唱着求偶的情歌，草叶上的小甲虫正用他的小腿梳理着他的触须……
    忽然，那不能发光，没有生命的月亮走到了地球和太阳之间，变成了一块黑暗的斑点，掩盖了太阳的光辉。
    大地顿时变得暗淡萧索了。
    于是，在许多生物间引起了一阵骚动。
    河边的一丛芦苇被风吹得前仰后合，她拼命地摆动她那纤弱的腰肢，挥动她那细嫩的胳臂，丧魂失魄地大喊：
    “不得了啦！太阳要毁灭啦，世界的末日到啦！我们怎么办？往哪里走，往哪里逃？”
    在她的旁边，有一只白鹤正用一只脚兀立在一块岩石上，长喙插在翅膀下面，眼睛半睁半闭，没精打采。芦苇的惊叫把他从梦幻般的境界里唤醒了，他扬起长脖子，对芦苇喝道：
    “住嘴！你搅扰了我的沉思！”
    “什么世道呵，你还在沉思！”芦苇低声地咕噜着。
    “我正在经历着有生以来最大的一次幻灭！”白鹤不胜慨叹地说：“我活了好几千年了。当我幼年的时候，我很天真，我崇拜天，敬重地，也爱那天上的十个日头。可是，到了后来，天倾西北，地陷东南，砸死了无数生灵；那十个日头又烤得赤地千里，草木不生。从此以后，我就认定天地间没有一件好东西，我什么都不相信。后来，自从女娲氏补好了天，后羿把九只假冒日头的乌鸦射了下来，剩一个太阳普照着万物，这些年来，倒也四季有序，五谷丰登，这样，我又渐渐对这个太阳发生了敬仰之情。我常常在黎明之前飞到东海去迎接火红的朝阳，对他顶礼赞颂。可是，万万想不到今天……”白鹤感伤得说不下去了。
    “你怎么啦？是不是要休息一下？”芦苇关切地问。
    白鹤定了定神，又继续说：
    “万万想不到今天，太阳上面竟长了一块黑斑，变得不成个样子了！我本是爱他的，可是像这样怎么还能保持我对他的信仰和敬爱？我再一次幻灭了！而且这次比以前任何一次都可悲！”白鹤悲哀地摆了摆头，合拢了他的长喙准备重新插进羽毛里去。
    “那么你今后打算怎么办呢？”芦苇问。
    “今后我什么都不相信了！”白鹤断然地说：“你知道我是有洁癖的，我不能容忍任何微小的瑕疵，他既然长了黑斑，他就不配当太阳！”
    “没有了太阳，我们还怎么能活着呢？”芦苇担心地问。
    这，白鹤却回答不上来。正好，从树林里飞来了一只萤火虫，回答了这个问题。萤火虫十分热情地安慰芦苇说：
      “不用担心，没有太阳你也可以活下去的！你看我吧，我不是也发着光么？”
    说着，他便翘起下腹，迸住气，用尽平生之力，努力发出一些淡绿色的光来。果然，他的光照亮了跟前的草木和土石，于是他便狂喜地大声宣布：
    “我完全可以代替太阳！我，我就是太阳！”
    他的话还没有说完，冷不防从岩洞里窜出来一只猫头鹰，一展翅膀，把萤火虫打到地上，随即恶狠狠地骂道：
    “走开吧，我们不需要任何的太阳！”
    说着，又面对着太阳发出令人毛骨悚然的笑声：
    “哈哈！你这可恨的太阳！你也有今天！你把我逼到岩穴里，昼伏夜出，受尽凄凉，如今也该我出出头了！”
    于是他一耸身飞上了高高的树梢，厉声叫道：
    “你们大地上有生的万物听着：太阳上的黑斑你们都亲眼看见了吧？其实他的罪状远不止这些，你们都想想，他平日是何等地作威作福，荼毒生灵？他用他的紫外线，杀害了多少好人？难道我们还能容忍下去吗？他不好，我们就要打倒他，杀他！你们不要对他抱着迷信，没有他，世界也不会灭亡的，我们一致欢迎黑暗之神来做大地的主宰！让我们一齐高呼：黑暗之神万岁！”
    猫头鹰的煽动并没有得到响应，却引起了一阵愤怒的嘲骂：
    “你说的‘好人’就是那些腐体上的细菌吧？”
    “别唱高调了，我们认识你！”
    “打倒黑暗之神！”
    芦苇也不满地咕哝着：“别的我不管，我只知道没有太阳我活不了！”
    白鹤惶惑地四面张望。
    萤火虫挣扎着想爬起来。
    这时候，山岗上有只金鸡发出了洪亮的啼声。他惯于在天明之前发出这样的呼唤，帮助太阳战胜黑夜，现在他又热烈唱起来了：
      “太阳，太阳！
    生命的源泉，
    宇宙的光，
    快用你的热，
    快用你的光，
    烧毁那黑暗的斑点，
    别让它掩盖住你的辉煌！”……
    当大地上发生这一切事情的时候，蚀中的太阳都听得清楚，看得明白。他从这里得到鼓舞，得到力量，也得到了警惕。他于是运起全身每一个细胞的力量，奋力一抖擞，迸发出万丈烈火，喷射到四面八方，把宇宙太空照得通红！一霎时，那黑暗的斑点已烧成灰烬，化为乌有。无垠的苍穹，又涌出一轮比先前更明亮，更温暖，更新鲜，更年青的太阳！
    在太阳的夺目的光华里，芦苇和白鹤揉了揉眼睛，渐渐地明白过来了：“哦！这不过是一次日蚀！”萤火虫羞红了脸，暗暗想道：“说真的，我的光是比太阳差一点。”那只见不得天日的猫头鹰呢，却被太阳的第一缕强光照瞎了眼睛，从高枝上掉下来了。
    大地上，又是春光明媚，一片花团锦簇。万物在和煦的阳光里蓬蓬勃勃地生长。
