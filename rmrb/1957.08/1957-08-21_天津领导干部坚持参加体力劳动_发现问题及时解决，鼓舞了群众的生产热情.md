Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 20th: Leading cadres in Tianjin's government offices, factories, and enterprises have established a system of participating in physical labor for several months.

　　In the process of going deep into the grassroots to participate in physical labor, they have further strengthened their ties with the masses. Hu Yukun, Deputy Secretary of the Tianjin Municipal Construction Party Committee, and the manager of the Third Construction Company and other responsible persons, after participating in labor on construction sites, found that a considerable number of workers were unable to complete their quotas because some quotas were set unreasonably. After research, they revised 15 unreasonable quota standards, which increased the total wage of the construction workers of this company by 10% in July compared with the original quota. Han Kefei, Deputy Director of the Tianjin Municipal Third Commercial Bureau, and others, after participating in sales work at the Dagu Road Comprehensive Food Store, found that the administrative staff of this store were all resting on Sundays, the busiest day for business. They decided to change the administrative staff to take turns off on other days and participate in sales work on Sundays to meet the needs of customers.

　　After the factory director and the Chinese Communist Party branch secretary of the Tianjin Oil Felt Factory participated in labor in the oil refining workshop, they found that the temperature of the oil pot was indeed very high when workers were cleaning the bottom of the pot. In the past, although workers had raised opinions in this regard, the leadership subjectively believed that the oil pot would not be very hot after cooling down overnight, so it had not been resolved for a long time. Now, this problem has been solved. When workers clean the bottom of the pot, they not only wear newly purchased asbestos clothing and pants that have been wetted with water, but there is also a mobile fan blowing air next to them, and the cleaning method has also been improved compared to the past.

　　Because these problems in work were discovered and resolved in a timely manner, the enthusiasm of the masses for labor was further encouraged.

　　天津领导干部坚持参加体力劳动
　　发现问题及时解决，鼓舞了群众的生产热情
    据新华社天津20日电　天津市机关、工厂、企业的领导干部参加体力劳动，几个月来已形成制度。
    他们在深入基层参加体力劳动的过程中，进一步密切了与群众的联系。中共天津市建筑党委副书记胡玉坤和第三建筑公司的经理等负责人，在参加建筑工地的劳动后，发现相当数量的工人完不成定额，原因是有些定额订得不合理。他们经过研究，对不合理的十五项定额标准作了修改，使这个公司的建筑工人7月份的工资总额较原定额提高了10％。天津市第三商业局副局长韩克非等人到大沽路综合食品商店参加售货工作后，发现这个商店的行政管理人员都在业务最忙的星期日休息，就决定把行政管理人员改在其他日子轮休，星期日参加售货工作，以适应顾客的要求。
    天津市油毡厂的厂长、中共支部书记到炼油车间参加劳动后，发现工人作清理锅底的工作时，油锅的温度确实很高。过去工人虽然提过这方面的意见，但是由于领导上主观地认为油锅已凉了一夜不会怎么热，因而长期没有解决。现在，这个问题已经解决。工人在清理锅底时，不但穿上了用水喷湿了的新购置的石棉衣裤，而且旁边还有流动风扇吹风，清理的方法也比过去有了改进。
    由于及时发现和解决了这些工作中的问题，就进一步鼓舞了群众的劳动热情。
