Northwest Engineering Bureau's Experience Proves
　　Increased Production Is Possible Even with Fewer Tasks
    (Reported by our reporter Li Qian) How can construction departments find ways to take on more work, reduce idle time, and create more wealth for the country, given the current situation of having a large workforce but few tasks? This is an important issue facing construction departments today. Some engineering companies under the Northwest Engineering Management Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering have provided good experiences.
      Actively Undertaking Miscellaneous Projects
    Contracting for miscellaneous projects is an important way for these companies to increase production and practice economy. In the past, some local construction units knew that these large companies mainly contracted for large-scale projects of various central ministries, and they did not dare to ask them to contract for their small construction tasks. Now, these engineering companies have put down the airs of big companies and proactively approach them. Northwest Fifth Engineering Company, etc., have contacted relevant departments of the local government and sent people to inquire about construction tasks everywhere, taking the initiative to contract for small projects. Subsequently, construction units also took the initiative to find them.
    Northwest Fifth Engineering Company has recently found more than 3 million yuan worth of construction tasks. These projects include buildings of several thousand square meters and buildings of several hundred square meters; in terms of cost, there are projects worth hundreds of thousands of yuan, tens of thousands of yuan, and thousands of yuan; there are offices, dormitories, and warehouses for government agencies and enterprises, as well as stadiums and sewers. The Third Sanitary Equipment Installation Company has also increased its income by more than 190,000 yuan by undertaking odd jobs and doing sanitary equipment maintenance work for fraternal units.
      Taking the Initiative to Undertake Design Tasks
    These construction units also pay special attention to utilizing surplus technical forces and try every means to open up avenues for increasing production and practicing economy. When the Baoji Engineering Office of the Northwest Third Engineering Company contacted some units to contract for projects, it found that some units urgently needed to build welfare facilities such as auditoriums, dormitories, and bathhouses, but the amount of work was not large, and the design units were busy designing large engineering projects, and they couldn't find anyone to design them for a while. This office took the initiative to propose to undertake the design tasks of these small projects, only charging some material costs and the wages of the designers. This approach was very popular with construction units. Some construction units entrusted them with both design and construction. In this way, it not only accelerated the construction speed and met the urgent needs of the construction units, but also increased their income. This office alone increased its workload by more than 190,000 yuan by undertaking the design and construction of auditoriums, canteens, and dormitories for the Baoji Major Repair Factory of the Ministry of Railways.
    The Baoji Engineering Office also drew some technical personnel to measure roads and flood control projects for local urban construction, rented out surplus machines to local fraternal units, and used its own X-ray fluoroscopy machine for health check-ups for the workers and staff of factories and enterprises in Baoji and Fengzhen (charging half as much as general hospitals). Some local government agencies and enterprises responded very well. They increased their income and strengthened their ties with fraternal units.
        Using Old Materials to Build New Houses
    Northwest Fifth Engineering Company reduced four or five temporary workers this year and dismantled many old timbers from the surplus work sheds; in the past few years of construction, there were still more than 1,000 prefabricated floor slabs and many large roof panels, as well as steel scraps, cement, bricks, and tiles. Some old materials are not worth much when sold, and are not even enough to cover the transportation costs, but if they are gathered together, many good houses can be built using the company's surplus manpower. The company proposed to the Xi'an Municipal Construction Committee and relevant leaders to build houses with these materials and sell them to other fraternal units for residence, and received support from relevant leaders in Xi'an. Therefore, the company decided to build 30,000 square meters of houses in the place designated by the Urban Planning Bureau. Like skillful tailors using scraps of fabric to make beautiful clothes, they design what kind of houses they want to build with whatever materials they have. These houses they designed include buildings and bungalows, brick-wood structures and mixed structures, offices, dormitories, and sales departments for commercial departments. Now, these houses have not yet been built, and the local People's Bank of China, Construction Bank, Public Transportation Company, and some commercial departments have contacted the company and requested to buy them after they are built. Northwest Fifth Company, by actively striving to contract small projects and building houses with old materials, can not only avoid being idle in the second half of the year, but also increase its income by more than one million yuan.

### 西北工程局经验证明　任务少仍能增产

    西北工程局经验证明
　　任务少仍能增产
    本报讯　本报记者李茜报道：施工部门在今年力量大、任务小的情况下，如何想办法多找一些工作，减少窝工现象，为国家创造更多的财富？这是施工部门当前的一个重要课题。建筑工程部西北工程管理总局所属的一些工程公司提供了良好的经验。
      积极包揽零星工程
    承包零星工程，是这些公司增产节约的一个重要门路。过去，地方上有些建设单位因为知道这些大公司主要是承包中央各部的大型工程，自己一点小建设任务，不敢去找他们承包。现在，这些工程公司放下了大公司的架子，主动找上门去。西北第五工程公司等都曾同当地政府有关部门联系，并派人到处打听哪里有建设任务，主动去承包小工程。随后，建设单位也主动来找他们了。
    西北第五工程公司最近已经找到了三百多万元的建设任务。这些工程有几千平方公尺的建筑，也有几百平方公尺的建筑；从造价看，有几十万元的，有几万元的，也有几千元的；有机关企业的办公室、宿舍和仓库，也有体育场和下水道。第三卫生设备安装公司也因为包揽零活，为兄弟单位做卫生设备维护工作，增加了十九万多元的收入。
      主动承担设计任务
    这些建筑单位还特别注意发挥多余的技术力量，千方百计地开辟增产节约的途径。西北第三工程公司宝鸡工程处在同一些单位联系承包工程的时候，发现有的单位急需建筑一些礼堂、宿舍、澡堂等福利设施，但是工程量不大，设计单位都忙于设计大的工程项目，一时找不到人设计。这个处就主动提出愿意担负这些小工程的设计任务，只收一些材料费用和设计人员的工资。这一作法很受建设单位的欢迎。有些建设单位就委托他们连设计带施工。这样，既加快了工程建设速度，满足了建设单位的迫切需要，又使自己增加了收入。这个处仅承担铁道部宝鸡大修厂设计和建筑礼堂、食堂和宿舍的工程，就增加了十九万多元的工作量。
    宝鸡工程处还抽出一些技术人员为当地城市建设测量道路和防洪工程，把多余的机器出租给当地兄弟单位使用，还利用本单位的X光透视机为宝鸡、?镇的工厂、企业职工作健康检查（收费比一般医院少二分之一）。当地一些机关、企业反映非常好。他们增加了收入，又密切了与兄弟单位的联系。
        利用旧材料盖新房子
    西北第五工程公司今年减少了四、五个临时工人，从多余的工棚中拆下许多旧木料；这几年施工中还剩下了一千多块预制楼板和不少大型屋面板，以及钢筋头、水泥、砖瓦等。有些旧料卖出去很不值钱，甚至还不够运费，但是，如果把它集在一起，就可以利用本公司多余的人力建成许多很好的房子。这个公司向西安市建委和有关领导人员提出了把这些材料建成房子，卖给其他兄弟单位居住的建议，得到西安市有关领导方面的支持。于是这个公司就决定在城市规划局指定的地方先建三万平方公尺房子。他们像巧手的裁缝利用不成材的碎布拼制美丽的服装一样，有什么材料设计什么样的房子。他们设计的这些房子中有楼房、也有平房，有砖木结构的、也有混合结构的，有办公室、宿舍，也有商业部门的门市部。现在，这些房子还没有建成，当地的人民银行、建设银行、公共汽车公司和一些商业部门已经同这个公司联系，要求建成后卖给他们。西北五公司由于主动争取承包小工程和利用旧料建房子，后半年非但可以不窝工，还可以增加一百多万元的收入。（附图片）
