“Selected Original Works of Western Classical Philosophy” Volume I
"Ancient Greek and Roman Philosophy" Published

To meet the needs of readers studying Western Philosophy, "Ancient Greek and Roman Philosophy," translated and edited, has been published by Sanlian Bookstore. This book is the first volume of the "Selected Original Works of Western Classical Philosophy," which amounts to more than three million words. This volume selects the main original works and materials of important philosophical schools in ancient Greece and Rome, edited according to the chronological order of different schools; the focus is on introducing the philosophical thoughts of the materialist schools, but the philosophical thoughts of the main idealist schools are also purposefully included. Therefore, it includes not only the Milesian school, Heraclitus, Democritus, and Epicurus, but also Socrates and Plato, etc., and more philosophical works of Aristotle are selected. Other schools that have special significance in the history of philosophy, such as the Eleatic school, the Sophists, and the Stoics, have also selectively included representative works. In this volume, philosophers who have only a few fragments left or whose ideas can only be understood based on ancient literature records are introduced using the columns "Fragments of Writings" and "Literature Records." For philosophers with a large number of works handed down, the column "Selected Works" is used to select the main aspects of their theories.

The selection scope of "Ancient Greek and Roman Philosophy" ranges from the Milesian school represented by Thales in the 580s BC to the late Greek philosophical schools (namely, the late Skeptics and Neo-Platonists), including the works or literature records of more than 30 philosophical schools and philosophers. The source materials for this volume, the writings of Plato, Aristotle, and the pre-Socratic philosophical schools, are translated based on English, French, and German versions, while also consulting the Greek text. Most of the others are translated based on the original works. Each article selected in this volume, during the translation process, is based on and refers to 18 famous Western philosophy history works, such as Diels' "Fragments of the Pre-Socratics" and Burnet's "Early Greek Philosophy."

In addition to this first volume, "Ancient Greek and Roman Philosophy," the "Selected Original Works of Western Classical Philosophy" also includes "European Medieval and Renaissance Philosophy," "16th-18th Century Western European Philosophy," "18th Century French Philosophy," "Late 18th-Early 19th Century German Philosophy," and "19th Century Russian Revolutionary Democrats' Philosophy." It is planned to publish them successively within five years. The translation and compilation work is organized by the Foreign Philosophy History Teaching and Research Section of the Philosophy Department of Peking University, with the joint efforts of eight or nine comrades who have studied Western philosophy history.

The publication of such a huge selection of original works of Western classical philosophy is not only a historical pioneering work in our country, but also rare internationally. The publication of this book will certainly be of great help to general readers who are beginners in Western philosophy history, and will also be of certain reference value to experts in the study of philosophy history.

    “西方古典哲学原著选辑”第一卷
    “古希腊罗马哲学”出版
    为应学习西方哲学史读者的需要而翻译编辑的“古希腊罗马哲学”，已由三联书店出版。这本书是篇幅达三百余万字的“西方古典哲学原著选辑”的第一卷。这一卷选录了古希腊罗马重要哲学派别的主要原著和材料，按照不同的学派以时代的先后编辑；重点在于介绍唯物主义学派的哲学思想，但对主要的唯心主义学派的哲学思想也有目的地选入了。因此其中既有米利都学派、赫拉克利特、德谟克里特和伊璧鸠鲁等，也有苏格拉底和柏拉图等，而亚里士多德的哲学著作则选录的比较多。其他在哲学史上有特殊意义的，如爱利亚学派、智者派和斯多葛派等，也酌量选录了其中具有代表性的著作。这一卷中对仅遗留下来少数残篇或只能根据古代文献记载了解他们思想梗概的哲学家，采取了“著述残篇”和“文献记载”的栏目予以介绍，对有大量著作流传下来的哲学家，则以“著作选录”的栏目选辑了他们学说主要方面的著作。
    “古希腊罗马哲学”的选录范围，是从公元前五百八十多年前以泰利士为代表的米利都学派起，直到晚期希腊哲学派别（即晚期怀疑派和新柏拉图派）为止，共包括了三十多个哲学派的和哲学家的著作或文献记载。这一卷的取材来源，柏拉图、亚里士多德和苏格拉底以前的哲学派的著述，是根据英文、法文和德文本译出，同时也参阅了希腊文本。其他大都根据原著译出。此卷所选各篇，在翻译过程中，根据并参考了弟尔斯的“苏格拉底以前哲学家残篇”和比尔耐的“早期希腊哲学家”等十八种西方哲学史方面的名著。
    “西方古典哲学原著选辑”除了这第一卷“古希腊罗马哲学”之外，还有“欧洲中世纪与文艺复兴时代哲学”、“十六—十八世纪西欧各国哲学”，“十八世纪法国哲学”、“十八世纪末—十九世纪初德国哲学”和“十九世纪俄国革命民主主义者的哲学”诸卷。计划在五年内陆续出版。翻译和编选的工作是由北京大学哲学系外国哲学史教研室负责组织对西方哲学史有研究的八、九位同志共同进行的。
    出版篇幅这样巨大的西方古典哲学原著选辑，不但在我国是历史上的创举，就在国际上也是罕见的。这部书的出版，对于我国初学西方哲学史的一般读者帮助一定很大，而对于研究哲学史的专家，也将有一定的参考价值。　　（韩相明）
