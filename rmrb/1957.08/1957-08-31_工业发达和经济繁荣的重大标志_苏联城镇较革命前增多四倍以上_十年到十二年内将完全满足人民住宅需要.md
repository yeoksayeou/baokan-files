    Major Signs of Industrial Development and Economic Prosperity
    Number of Soviet Cities More Than Quadrupled Compared to Pre-Revolution
    People's Housing Needs to Be Fully Met Within Ten to Twelve Years
    (People's Daily, Moscow, August 30th) The increase and development of cities is a major sign of the Soviet Union's industrial development and economic prosperity. In April 1956, the Soviet Union had 1,569 cities and 2,422 towns, a stark contrast to the 721 cities and 54 towns in pre-revolutionary Russia.
    During the Soviet era, the number of cities east of the Urals has doubled. More than fifty cities have sprung up in the Urals. In the European north of the Soviet Union, the number of cities has increased from nine before the revolution to the current twenty-one. The number of cities in the Donbas has increased tenfold. In the South Caucasus, the number has increased from twenty before the revolution to the current eighty, with another one hundred and twenty-seven towns. In the Central Asian republics, forty-eight new cities and two hundred and eighty-two towns have appeared. In Kazakhstan, Karaganda, a former semi-desert area of handicraftsmen, has risen to become the center of the Central Asian coal region, covering 671 square kilometers with a population of 350,000. Magnitogorsk, a steel city built in the Ural steppes, stretches for twenty-five kilometers along the river and has a population of 280,000. In the Arctic Circle of Siberia, Norilsk has emerged, where a huge metallurgical plant has been built. The mountains surrounding this city contain more coal than the Donbas. Copper, nickel, cobalt, platinum, gold, and silver are mined there. This young city already has a population of nearly 160,000.
    New cities have sprung up in places where large hydropower stations are being built—Zhugulevsk, New Kakhovka, Bratsk, etc. Cities are constantly being born. Such as Almetyevsk, the oil workers' city in the Tatar ASSR, Kumertau, the coal miners' city in Bashkiria, and Makinsk, the mechanical workers' city in Kazakhstan.

    (People's Daily, Moscow, August 29th) The Soviet Union will fully meet the housing needs of the people within ten to twelve years. In the ten years after the war, from 1946 to 1956, the Soviet Union has built and repaired 300 million square meters of living space in cities and workers' villages, which is one and a half times the total housing area of the country before the revolution. But it still cannot meet the needs. Therefore, it is still necessary to expand the scale of housing construction. Promyslov, Director of the Moscow Housing Construction Administration, spoke about the efforts of the Soviet capital in this regard at a press conference today.
    According to Moscow's ten-year reconstruction plan in 1951, 10 million square meters of living space should be built. During the previous five-year plan, 4.3 million square meters were built, leaving 5.7 million square meters during this five-year plan. Now the task has been raised, and 11.2 million square meters will be built during this five-year plan, which exceeds the total residential area of Moscow before the revolution. This year alone, Moscow will build 1.8 million square meters, or 62,000 apartments, adding 12.2 apartments per thousand residents on average. According to Paris newspapers, in 1956, the UK only added 6.4 apartments per thousand residents, and France added 5.5. The Southwest New District, where Moscow University is located, only appeared in 1954, and 3 million square meters will be built in the next three years. This district will house 300,000 people, and a subway line will be open there next year.
    In order to build quickly, economically, and conveniently, many methods have been adopted. For example, in the future, four- and five-story buildings without elevators and eight-story buildings with elevators will be built. In the past, most of the buildings were large apartments with three or four rooms and forty or fifty square meters, accommodating two or three families, which residents found inconvenient. From this year on, small apartments with two or three rooms and twenty to thirty-five square meters, accommodating one family, will be widely built. The height of the rooms used to be three meters, but now it has been reduced to two point seven meters. At the same time, standard designs will be adopted from this year. This year, 200,000 square meters will be built with concrete components, 600,000 square meters next year, and will increase to 1 million square meters after the component factories are expanded. Many tasks, such as excavation, mixing concrete, installing stairs, and ladder panels, are 90% or fully mechanized.

    工业发达和经济繁荣的重大标志
    苏联城镇较革命前增多四倍以上
    十年到十二年内将完全满足人民住宅需要
    本报莫斯科30日电　城市的增加和发展是苏联工业发达和经济繁荣的一个重大标志。苏联在1956年4月有一千五百六十九座城市和二千四百二十二座市镇，而革命前俄国才有七百二十一座城市和五十四座市镇，这是鲜明的对照。
    在苏维埃政权时代，从乌拉尔以东，城市数目增加了一倍。在乌拉尔兴起了五十多座城市。在苏联欧洲北部从革命前九座增加到现在二十一座。顿巴斯城市数目增长了十倍。在南高加索从革命前二十座增加到现在八十座，还有一百二十七座市镇。在中亚各共和国出现了四十八座新城市和二百八十二座市镇。在哈萨克斯坦只有手工业者的半戈壁滩上兴起了卡拉甘达，它成为中亚煤区的中心，广达六百七十一平方公里，人口三十五万。在乌拉尔草原建立的钢铁城市马格尼托哥尔斯克，沿河伸展二十五公里，人口二十八万。在西伯利亚的北极圈里，出现了诺里尔斯克，在那里建设了巨大的冶金工厂。这个城市周围的群山，蕴藏着比顿巴斯还多的煤。在那里开采着铜和镍，钴和白金，金和银。这个年青城市已经有人口近十六万。
    在那些建筑大水电站的地方，都产生了新城市——朱古列夫斯克、新卡霍夫卡、布拉次克等等城市在不断诞生。它们还不大为人知道。如鞑靼里亚石油工人城阿尔米捷夫斯克、巴什基里亚煤矿工人城库米尔塔乌、哈萨克斯坦机械工人城马金斯克。
    本报莫斯科29日电　苏联将在十年到十二年内完全满足人民住宅的需要。战后十年中，即从1946年至1956年苏联在城市和工人村已经建筑和修复了三亿平方米居住面积，也就是革命前全国住宅总面积的一倍半。但是还不能满足需要。因此仍要扩大住宅建筑的规模。莫斯科住宅建筑总局局长普罗米斯洛夫今天在记者招待会上谈了苏联首都在这方面的努力情况。
    按照1951年的莫斯科十年改建计划，应该建筑一千万平方米的居住面积。在前一个五年计划期间建筑了四百三十万平方米，在这个五年计划期间留下五百七十万平方米。现在把任务提高了，在这个五年计划期间要建筑一千一百二十万平方米，即超过革命前莫斯科的住宅总面积。仅在今年，莫斯科将建筑一百八十万平方米，即六万二千套住宅，平均每一千居民增添十二点二套。而据巴黎报纸统计，在1956年，英国每千居民才增添了六点四套，法国增添了五点五套。莫斯科大学所在的西南新区是1954年才出现的，今后三年将建筑三百万平方米。这个区将居住三十万人口，明年就有地下电车线通到那里。
    为了建筑得又快、又省、又方便，采取了许多办法。例如今后将建筑不用电梯的四、五层楼房和有电梯的八层楼房。从前盖的多是每三、四间房，四、五十平方米的大套住宅，住两三家，居民感到不便。从今年起要广泛地建筑两三间房、二十到三十五平方米的小套住宅，住一家。房间的高度过去是三米，现在降为二点七米。同时从今年起将采用标准设计。今年用混凝土构件建筑二十万平方米，明年六十万平方米，在构件工厂增建以后将增加到一百万平方米。许多工作，如像挖土、搅拌混凝土、安装楼梯、梯板等，都是90％或全部机械化的。
