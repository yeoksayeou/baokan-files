Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 31st -- Wuhan's publishing and literary circles have recently held successive gatherings to criticize Jiang Yun, the deputy editor-in-chief of Hubei People's Publishing House and a Party rightist, for her anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds. At a symposium convened by the Wuhan branch of the Writers Association on May 31st, Jiang Yun launched a series of venomous arrows at the Party's publishing and literary guidelines. She said, "The leadership proposes that publishing houses should pursue 'three-izations' – popularization, massification, and localization. Now we are outwardly compliant but inwardly defiant, because if we listen to the 'three-izations,' the books we publish will not be read, no one will buy them, and the publishing house will have to close down." At the same meeting, she also spoke in defense of Hu Feng and Liu Shahe.

Jiang Yun's anti-Party words and deeds have been consistent. According to revealed materials, she has always opposed dialectics. She said dialectics is "quackery" and "dialectics always argues that the Communist Party is right, and others are always wrong." She agreed with the "Comrades Publishing House" approach taken by another rightist element in the publishing house.

Now, after several large and small criticism sessions, Jiang Yun's anti-Party remarks have been exposed. Faced with the iron facts, she admits that she has degenerated into a rightist element.

    铁的事实驳倒了谬论
    江云承认自己堕落为右派分子
    据新华社武汉31日电　武汉市出版界和文艺界最近连续集会，批判湖北人民出版社副总编辑、党内右派分子江云的反党反社会主义言行。江云在5月31日作家协会武汉分会召开的座谈会上，对党的出版方针、文艺方针发射了一连串的毒箭：她说：“领导上提出出版社要通俗化、群众化、地方化等‘三化’，现在我们是阳奉阴违，因为如果听‘三化’的话，出的书就没人看，没人买，出版社就得关门”。就在这次会上，她还为胡风、流沙河叫屈。
    江云的反党言行是一贯的。根据揭发的材料看，她平日就反对辩证法。她说辩证法是“江湖术”“辩证法辩来辩去都是共产党对，别人总不对”。她同意这个出版社的另一右派分子搞“同仁出版社”的做法。
    现在，经过几次大、小会的批驳，江云的反党言论已经被揭穿。在铁的事实面前，她承认自己已堕落为右派分子。
