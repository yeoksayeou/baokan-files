Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 24th: Shanghai's industrial sector has overcome a period of raw material supply shortages and is entering a new, busy phase of production in the final months of the First Five-Year Plan.

All industrial sectors, except textiles, will grow more in the second half of this year than in the first half. The city's total industrial output value is expected to exceed the annual plan by more than 4% by the end of the year, surpassing the highest level since liberation in 1956.

The iron and steel industry, which achieved very outstanding results in increasing production in the first few months, will maintain its planned output of steel and steel products at about the same level as the first half of the year in the second half, even though some steelmaking furnaces will undergo major repairs. By the end of the year, the iron and steel workers will bid farewell to the First Five-Year Plan with an increase of more than 30,000 tons of steel and more than 80,000 tons of steel products compared to this year's annual plan.

Almost all the products being produced in the workshops of the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant are new, precision grinders successfully trial-produced during the First Five-Year Plan, and they will continue to trial-produce seven new products. After successfully trial-producing the first 12,000 kW steam turbine in China in five and a half months, the Shanghai Turbine Plant will continue to produce five more units in the second half of the year.

More than 4,000 light industrial factories, with the easing of raw material supplies, are now working hard to increase the production of daily necessities according to the needs of the peak season market. Compared with the first half of the year, the second half will see an increase of more than 15,000 bicycles, more than 11,000 sewing machines, more than 310,000 flashlights, and more than 585,000 gold pens. The output of aluminum pots, which are urgently needed by the masses, will increase from more than 580,000 in the first half of the year to 1.4 million in the second half. Workers at the 25 paper mills will also complete the annual target of increasing paper production by 5,100 tons four months ahead of schedule by the end of this month.

The chemical industry, which is being developed as a key area, has increasingly heavy production tasks in the second half of the year, quarter by quarter. After the expansion of more than a dozen factories was completed not long ago, the output of six important chemical raw materials has increased by 30% to 100%. A number of other factories will also be completed within the year. After the completion of the expansion of the Taishan Organic Chemical Plant, the output of saccharin will double.

The supply of industrial raw materials in the city that currently still faces difficulties is the textile industry. Textile workers and technicians are working to increase cotton cloth production by saving raw cotton in various ways, reducing production losses, and making full use of cotton waste. Local textile factories plan to save more than 1,200 bales of cotton yarn in the second half of the year, increasing production by more than 30 million yuan.

Many industrial leading departments have recently adopted a division of labor responsibility system to strengthen leadership over the grass-roots production increase and conservation movement to ensure the completion of the production tasks for the last few months of the First Five-Year Plan.

    跨过原材料供应紧张时期
　　上海工业生产步入繁忙阶段
　  今年的总产值可超过解放后最高水平
    据新华社上海24日电　在第一个五年计划的最后几个月里，上海工业部门跨过了原材料供应紧张的时期，正在步入一个生产繁忙的新阶段。
    各项工业除纺织外，今年下半年都将比上半年增长。全市工业总产值预计到年底可以超额4％以上完成全年计划，将超过解放以来最高的1956年的水平。
    前几个月增产成绩很突出的钢铁工业，下半年尽管有一部分炼钢炉要进行大修理，但是钢和钢材的计划产量仍和上半年差不多。到年底，钢铁工人们将以比今年年度计划增产三万多吨钢和八万多吨钢材的成绩，向第一个五年计划告别。
    上海机床厂的各个车间里正在生产的产品，几乎全部都是第一个五年计划期间试制成功的新型精密磨床，并且还要继续试制七种新产品。上海汽轮机厂以五个半月时间试制成功国内第一台一万二千瓩汽轮机以后，下半年接着就要生产五台。
    四千多个轻工业工厂在原材料供应已经缓和的情况下，目前正根据旺季市场的需要努力增产日用品。下半年与上半年比较：自行车将增产一万五千多辆，缝纫机将增产一万一千多架，手电筒将增产三十一万个，金笔将增产五十八万五千支。群众迫切需要的铝锅，下半年的产量将由上半年的五十八万多只增加到一百四十万只。二十五家造纸厂的工人们，也将在这个月底以提前四个月的时间完成全年增产五千一百吨纸的指标。
    正在重点发展中的化学工业，下半年的生产任务一个季度比一个季度繁重。有十几个工厂不久前扩建完工以后，六种重要的化工原料的产量已提高了30％到一倍。还有一批工厂也将在年内扩建完成，泰山有机化工厂扩建完工后，糖精产量将增加一倍。
    全市工业原料供应目前仍有困难的是纺织工业。纺织工人和技术人员们正在从多方面节约原棉、减少生产损耗和充分利用下脚棉，来增产棉布。地方纺织工厂计划下半年节约棉纱一千二百余件，增产三千余万元。
    许多工业领导部门最近采取分工负责的办法，加强对基层增产节约运动的领导，以保证完成第一个五年计划最后几个月的生产任务。
