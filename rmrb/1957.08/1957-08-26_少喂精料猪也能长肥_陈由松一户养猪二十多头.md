　　Pigs Can Get Fat Even With Less Concentrated Feed
　　Chen Yousong's Family Raises More Than Twenty Pigs
    (Our report) Chen Yousong's family in Zhanghu Town, Nanping County, Fujian Province, raises more than twenty pigs. He raises pigs that are especially fat. On average, each piglet bought at around sixteen catties can weigh two hundred catties after ten months.
    In addition to being particularly careful in feeding management, Chen Yousong is also very economical in terms of feed. Except for piglets that are two months old, general medium and large pigs are fed with a mixture of two-fourths substitute food (red duckweed, etc.), one-fourth coarse rice bran (screened from the rice husks of grain processing plants), and one-fourth fine bran. Because he raises so many pigs, he has to prepare the feed early. In the spring, he collects a large amount of red duckweed from the paddy fields and dries it to supplement when other substitute foods are scarce. This not only saves grain but also reduces the cost of raising pigs. In the second half of last year, he also created a method of feeding pigs with raw feed: mix various feeds together, without cooking, and soak them in an appropriate amount of water (use warm water or boiling water in winter). This reduces the labor of cooking feed every day and saves the cost of burning firewood. After ten months of testing, it has been proven that this method of feeding pigs is very good for their daily digestion and growth.

　　少喂精料猪也能长肥
　　陈由松一户养猪二十多头
    本报讯  福建省南平县樟湖镇陈由松一户养了二十多头猪。他养猪养得特别肥大，平均每头从十六斤左右买来的小猪经过十个月后，就能重二百斤。
    陈由松养猪除了在饲养管理方面特别细心以外，在饲料方面他也是很节约的，除了两个月的小猪外，一般的中猪、大猪都是以四分之二代食品（红萍等）、四分之一粗米糠（是由粮食加工厂的谷壳中筛下来的）和四分之一的细糠混拌为饲料。因为猪养得多，弄饲料就得早作准备。他在春季就大量地把水田里的红萍捞起来晒干，待其他代食品缺少时作为补充。这样不但节约了粮食，也降低了养猪成本。去年下半年他还创造了生饲料喂猪方法：把各种饲料配合起来，不用熟煮，泡上适量的水即可（冬季要用温汤或开水），这样既减少每天煮饲料的工，又节约了烧柴火的成本。经过十个月来的试验，已证明这样喂猪方法，对猪的日常消化和生长发育都很好。
