  　Feicheng peaches in large quantities enter the market
    (Our newspaper's Shandong reporter station) The famous Shandong Feicheng peaches began to enter the market in large quantities in mid-August. The first batch of more than 13,000 jin has been shipped to Tianjin and other places.
    Each Feicheng peach generally weighs seven or eight liang and the peach juice is particularly sweet and fragrant. Among them, the "Buddha Peach" has the best quality and highest yield. In addition to supplying cities such as Beijing and Jinan this year, some will still be sold abroad.
    In order to extend the maturity period of Feicheng peaches, Shangli Agricultural Cooperative has cultivated a batch of peach trees of varieties such as "May Fresh", "June White" and "September Frozen", so that urban and rural people can eat different varieties of Feicheng peaches from May to September.

  　肥城桃大量登市
    本报讯　著名的山东肥城大桃，8月中旬已开始大量登市，首批一万三千多斤已运往天津等地。
    肥城大桃每个一般有七、八两重，桃汁特别香甜。其中质量最好、产量最高的要算“佛桃”，今年除供应北京、济南等城市外，仍将有一部分运销国外。
    为了延长肥城大桃的成熟期，尚里农业社培植了一批“五月鲜”、“六月白”和“九月冻”等品种的桃树，使城乡人民有可能在5至9月份内，都能吃到不同品种的肥城桃。　（本报山东记者站）
