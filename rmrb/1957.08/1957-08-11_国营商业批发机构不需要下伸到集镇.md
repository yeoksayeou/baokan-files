Editor's Note: In order to implement the policy of "increasing production and practicing economy, building the country through diligence and frugality," how to overcome the shortcomings of complex and overlapping organizations and excessive links in commodity circulation in socialist commerce, thereby accelerating the turnover of commodities and funds, reducing commodity circulation costs, and better serving production and consumption is an extremely important issue. At present, many regions across the country are carrying out pilot work on commercial system reform. These two articles are for reference in various places.

State-Owned Commercial Wholesale Organizations Do Not Need to Extend Down to Market Towns
Ouyang Zhuo
Since the State Council issued the "Decision on the Extension of State-Owned Commercial Industrial Products Organizations" in March of last year, state-owned commercial systems in various provinces have set up company organizations in county towns, and some have set up wholesale and retail outlets in market towns below the county level. According to statistics from the Ministry of Commerce in late 1956, the state-owned commercial system (including parts transferred to the Urban Services Department this year) had a total of 9,771 wholesale organizations and 3,175 retail organizations below the county level. There were sixteen categories of specialized wholesale organizations extending to rural market towns, among which exclusive sales, department stores, and textiles were the most common; followed by coal and building materials, food, vegetable and food groceries, medicine, etc. Now, I would like to express some opinions only on the issue of setting up wholesale outlets in market towns.

The development of commercial organizations is determined by the development of retail sales, and the increase or decrease in retail sales is determined by the development of production. In 1956, the total rural commodity retail sales increased by 66% compared to 1952, which shows that the rural economy has been much more prosperous in the years since liberation than before the war, and the lives of the vast number of peasants have improved significantly. However, on the other hand, it must also be seen that the living standards of Chinese peasants are still not high, and the increase in their purchasing power can only be gradual and limited. Under the current circumstances, is it necessary for state-owned commerce to set up wholesale outlets in market towns?

According to historical survey materials, the vast majority of rural market towns in China have never had specialized wholesale stores selling general merchandise and other commodities. A small number of retail stores selling industrial products either obtained their goods from itinerant merchants or purchased them themselves from elsewhere. Individual private merchants engaged in general merchandise wholesale were still mainly engaged in retail.

From 1954, supply and marketing cooperatives took on the task of transforming private commerce in rural areas; the grassroots stores of the supply and marketing cooperatives also undertook the business of wholesaling to private merchants. According to statistics from July 1955, the number of private merchants in rural areas was 2.67 million. In that year, the wholesale volume of rural grassroots cooperatives to private merchants, converted into retail sales, accounted for approximately one-third of the retail sales of private merchants that year. In 1956, the vast majority of private merchants in rural areas had formed joint ventures, cooperative stores, or groups, becoming distribution or agency stores of the supply and marketing cooperatives, and they purchased more of their goods from the supply and marketing cooperatives. In that year, the wholesale volume of supply and marketing cooperatives to private merchants accounted for approximately one-half of their total retail sales.

In terms of retail organizations, the development of supply and marketing cooperatives has also been rapid. Taking 1952 as 100, the development index of rural supply and marketing cooperative organizations and funds in 1956 was: retail and wholesale stores 220, business personnel 219, and own funds 332. This ratio exceeds the increase in retail sales. The supply and marketing cooperatives, with their large number of personnel, strong funds, and strong leadership, are immeasurably more powerful than small merchants and have the conditions to purchase goods themselves from elsewhere, completely independent of short-distance wholesale. This has been the practice in previous years. Based on the analysis of the above materials, the current level of rural economic development and the existing state of socialist commerce have not yet demanded the establishment of specialized wholesale stores.

The basic principles for the establishment of commercial organizations are to facilitate mass purchases, conform to economic accounting, and comply with the laws of commodity circulation. Practice over the past year or more has proved that the extension of state-owned commercial wholesale organizations to market towns does not conform to these principles.

First, it causes a huge waste of manpower, materials, and financial resources. The Cuozhen State-Owned Department Store Distribution Office in Feidong County, Anhui Province, had eight staff members at the end of 1955. If the supply and marketing cooperative also handled wholesale, at least three people could be reduced. In some areas, there are seven or eight state-owned company wholesale outlets in one town. Taking the three wholesale groups of exclusive sales, department stores, and textiles as an example, these organizations use at least nine to twelve extra people. At the end of 1956, there were more than 38,000 state-owned wholesale personnel below the county level nationwide, and a considerable portion of them were definitely redundant. With the increase in wholesale organizations, commodity inventory is bound to be dispersed. Therefore, although the total inventory of commodities in rural areas has increased, its dispersion affects the flexibility of national allocation.

The state-owned commercial wholesale organizations extending to rural areas often have light business. Some business personnel have nothing to do, so they often sleep and play cards, and the masses call such companies "entertainment companies." This light business situation makes it reasonable to estimate that there are not a few wholesale outlets that are losing money. For example, the Quyangqiao Department Store Wholesale Group in Zhengding County, Hebei Province, lost 2,086 yuan from May to December 1955 alone. The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Commerce believes that the cost level in 1956 was higher than in 1955, mainly due to the extension of state-owned wholesale organizations.

Second, the original normal commodity circulation laws below the county level have been disrupted. First of all, the circulation links have increased. According to materials from the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Commerce, after the extension of wholesale organizations to market towns, products from Shanghai generally have to go from the central station through the second-level station, the county company, and the wholesale point in the market town before they can reach the retail unit. If it is a concurrently operated commodity, there must also be a link from the main operating company to the concurrently operating company. This is one to two more links than before. Secondly, the location of wholesale points is often unreasonable. For example, the four points of Ranzhi, Weiting, Chefang, and Xiangcheng in the suburbs of Suzhou City, Jiangsu Province, have always obtained goods from Shanghai or Kunshan, which is in line with the laws of circulation. But now it has been changed to go from Shanghai to Suzhou, and then distributed to various points. The links have increased, the commodities have flowed backward for thirty to seventy li, thus increasing the cost.

Third, the phenomenon of incomplete commodity varieties and insufficient quantities is even more serious. The state-owned commercial market town wholesale groups have few personnel, a small amount of approved funds, and no right to purchase goods from other places. The quantity, variety, and colors of goods in stock are much less than those of county companies. For example, the Department Store Company of Heping County, Guangdong Province, operates 25,000 kinds of goods, but each wholesale group generally has only more than 500 kinds. Such a small variety cannot meet the needs of retail units for goods. On March 10, the Fanjiashan Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Shaodong County, Hunan Province, wanted to purchase 55 kinds of goods, but the local department store wholesale store only had 31 kinds. With state-owned wholesale organizations limited to a relatively small quota of funds, to ensure quantity, the variety must be reduced; to make the variety complete, the quantity of each item cannot meet the requirements of the purchasers. To ensure both variety and quantity, the funding quota must be greatly increased. Subsequently, the degree of inventory backlog and dispersion will also greatly increase. This contradiction is obviously difficult to resolve.

The establishment of commercial organizations must also be conducive to strengthening the management of the market. Especially after the opening of the free market, this role is even more important. However, after the state-owned wholesale organizations extended downward, small merchants were all placed under the leadership of the competent industry, but state-owned companies located in towns cannot lead small merchants scattered in the countryside. Moreover, because small merchants operate across lines and industries, it is also impossible to control their operating volume by controlling the source of goods. Therefore, small merchants take advantage of loopholes everywhere, and speculative activities have increased significantly compared to before. For example, Shi Dejian, a peddler from Zhuya Town, Yidu, Shandong, bought yellow paper (superstitious items) from Zhoucun at a price of 47 cents per knife and sold it for 1.5 yuan, with a gross profit of 320%. Many peddlers in the Koubu District purchased bicycles from the county town at high prices for resale, and some even dried waste tea leaves and mixed them with good tea for sale. It can be seen that this practice also weakens the leadership of the market. In some areas, after the state-owned wholesale organizations extended downward, they were only responsible for the wholesale business to private merchants, while the supply and marketing cooperatives were still responsible for their transformation. Experience has proven that this is not a good method either. Because the supply and marketing cooperatives cannot control the source of goods, the transformation is just empty talk.

However, comrades who insist on advocating the extension of state-owned wholesale organizations to market towns say that "the advantages outweigh the disadvantages, and the extension is still correct." They have several basic arguments.

The first argument is: "After the extension of state-owned wholesale organizations, it can solve the problem of large state-owned inventory on the one hand and out-of-stock in the market on the other hand, caused by the supply and marketing cooperatives not actively purchasing goods." What is the reality? From 1954 to 1956, the inventory of several major commodities in supply and marketing cooperatives nationwide exceeded the reference indicators for fixed reserves by more than one time, especially department store commodities, which exceeded two times; the inventory amount has also increased rapidly in recent years. Therefore, it is impossible to draw the conclusion that supply and marketing cooperatives are not actively purchasing goods.

Of course, it is also a fact that some stores have indeed accumulated commodities. The manager of the Department Store Company of Zhengding County, Hebei, said: This is mainly because the company does not calculate profits and losses, does not approve funds, and has a supply system mentality, resulting in blind purchases. The company's sales for the entire year of 1955 were 500,000 yuan, but the inventory at the end of the year was as high as 800,000 yuan. With such a large backlog, it cannot be solved even with a large distribution of commodities. As for the phenomenon of out-of-stock, it should be said that it is common in many commercial departments. However, the reason for its occurrence is that the national production of several major commodities is insufficient, while the out-of-stock of general commodities is mostly due to improper commercial measures. Among the latter reasons, it is true that some grassroots cooperatives are very conservative and unwilling to actively try to sell new commodities, and some even do not want to find ways to purchase goods when commodities are out of stock for a long time; but the more important reason is that state-owned companies do not adjust well, and the variety and quantity of goods in stock cannot meet the needs of supply and marketing cooperatives. After entering the second half of last year, the latter reason became more prominent.

The second argument is: "The extension of wholesale organizations can more directly understand the needs of the masses and can more conveniently put forward suggestions to production departments on improving production." The general movement formula for understanding consumer needs is: retail store - wholesale station - production department. The latter two units mainly rely on the materials of the retail department to understand the needs of the masses. Therefore, for wholesale departments to understand these materials in depth and extensively, the first and most important thing is to improve the contact system with retail departments, and the two sides should actively combine to ensure that retail units have materials that can be reflected to wholesale units in a timely manner (in this regard, Suiling County, Heilongjiang Province, has created better experience). Therefore, this is a matter of working system and working methods, not a matter of system.

The third argument: "The extension of wholesale organizations can solve the problem of inconvenience for small merchants to purchase goods due to the insufficient strength of supply and marketing cooperatives." First of all, it should be pointed out that it is not a fact that it is inconvenient for small merchants to purchase goods. This can be confirmed from the development of the wholesale business of supply and marketing cooperatives to merchants. In 1955, the supply and marketing cooperative system had 31,000 stores, which wholesaled 1.8 billion yuan of commodities to private merchants. In 1956, it further increased to 36,000 stores engaged in wholesale, and the wholesale volume also increased to 2.8 billion yuan. Compared with the state-owned companies, which only have more than 9,700 wholesale stores, the strength is obviously much stronger.

Secondly, after the extension of wholesale organizations, it is inconvenient for small merchants to purchase goods. In areas where supply and marketing cooperatives are not allowed to wholesale after the company's organizations have been extended, many merchants are unwilling to do business anymore. In the past, small merchants in Zhuliao Market in Panyu, Guangdong, did not go out of the village to purchase goods. After the state-owned wholesale organizations extended downward, they had to go to Zhongluotan to purchase goods, a distance of more than 30 li. Some wholesale groups unreasonably restrict merchants from purchasing goods from other places when their own goods are not complete. These all affect the enthusiasm of merchants to operate.

The last argument: "Supply and marketing cooperatives are collectively owned enterprises, and profits are not turned over to the state treasury. After the state-owned wholesale organizations extend downward, retail profits can be turned into wholesale profits to enrich the state treasury revenue." It should be pointed out that although supply and marketing cooperatives are collectively owned enterprises, they are also socialist enterprises; although profits are not directly turned over to the state treasury, the payment of income tax is essentially the same as turning over profits, but the form is different. In 1957, the average profit income of grassroots cooperatives will have about 65% of it turned over to the state treasury as income tax. The income tax rate of enterprises above the county level is even higher. Is it not better for the country to turn the expenses of the wholesale link into the profits of the retail department and then turn them over?

On the other hand, after many state-owned wholesale organizations extended downward, although they turned retail profits into wholesale profits, they still lost money due to large expenses and small businesses, which is truly unfavorable to enriching the state treasury revenue.

Some state-owned commercial departments have seen that there are many problems after the extension of wholesale organizations, and they have proposed to solve the difficulties by having wholesale organizations concurrently operate retail businesses and further receive the industrial products and non-staple food retail stores of the original supply and marketing cooperatives. Many places in Hunan, Guangdong, and other places have already done this, and some places are preparing to do so. This is obviously inappropriate.

Based on the above situation, I believe that emphasizing the extension of state-owned wholesale organizations to market towns is not appropriate at present. In order to improve the supply of industrial products in rural areas, to adapt to the development of industrial and agricultural production and the growing needs of people's consumer goods, the current issue is not the extension of wholesale organizations, but how to strengthen the business of supply and marketing cooperatives and closely connect the work of state-owned and cooperative commerce.

### 国营商业批发机构不需要下伸到集镇

    编者按：为了贯彻执行“增产节约，勤俭建国”的方针，社会主义商业当前如何克服机构庞杂、重叠和商品流转环节过多的缺点，从而加速商品和资金周转，降低商品流转费用，更好地为生产和消费服务，这是一个极其重要的问题。目前全国不少地区正在实行商业体制改革试点工作。这两篇文章可供各地研究。
    国营商业批发机构不需要下伸到集镇
    欧阳琸
    从去年3月国务院下达了“关于国营商业工业品机构下伸的决定”以后，各省国营商业系统都把公司机构设到县城，有的并在县以下集镇设了批发和零售点。据中央商业部1956年年底统计，国营商业系统（包括今年划归城市服务部的部分）县以下批发机构共有九千七百七十一个，零售机构有三千一百七十五个。下伸到农村集镇的专业批发机构共有十六类名目，其中以专卖、百货、纺织品最普遍；其次为煤建、食品、蔬菜食品杂货、医药等。现在仅就在集镇设置批发点问题，发表一些意见。
    商业机构的发展决定于零售额的发展，而零售额的增加或减少则决定于生产的发展。1956年农村商品零售总额就比1952年提高了66％，这说明解放几年来农村经济比战前繁荣多了，广大农民生活已经有了显著的改善。但是，另一方面还必须看到，当前我国农民的生活水平还是不高的，他们的购买力的提高也只能是逐渐的、有限度的。在现阶段的情况下国营商业是否需要在集镇上设置批发点呢？
    根据历史调查材料记载，我国广大农村集镇从来没有专营南杂货以及其它商品的批发商店，少数经营工业品的零售商店，其货源一部分来自行商，一部分是自己外出采购的，个别做杂货批发生意的私商，也还是以零售为主。
    从1954年起，供销合作社担负了对农村私营商业实行改造的任务；供销社的基层商店还担负了对私商批发的业务。根据1955年7月的统计，农村私商人数为二百六十七万人，这一年农村基层社对私商批发额折成零售额大约占当年私商零售额的三分之一。1956年绝大部分农村私商已经组成了合营商店、合作商店或小组，成为供销社的经销或代销商店，其货物由供销社购进的更多了。这一年供销社对私商批发额约占其零售总额的二分之一。
    在零售机构方面，供销社的发展也很快。如以1952年为一百，则1956年农村供销社组织和资金发展指数是：零售和批发商店二百二十，业务人员二百一十九，自有资金三百三十二。这个比例是超过零售额增长幅度的。供销合作社由于人员多，资金雄厚，领导力量强，比起小商贩来力量大得不可计量，有条件自己外出采购，完全不依赖短途批发。前几年一直是这样做的。根据以上材料分析，目前农村经济的发展水平和社会主义商业的现有状况，还没有提出设立专业批发商店的要求。
    商业机构设置的基本原则是便利群众购买，符合经济核算，合乎商品流转规律。一年多来的实践证明，国营商业批发机构下伸到集镇，是不符合这个原则的。
    第一，人力、物力、财力的巨大浪费。安徽省肥东县撮镇国营百货分销处1955年底共有八个工作人员。如由供销社兼批发，至少可以减少三个人。有的地区一个镇上有七、八个国营公司批发点，以专卖、百货、纺织品三个批发组计算，这些机构至少多用九个到十二个人。1956年底，全国县以下国营批发人员共三万八千余人，肯定有相当一部分是多余的。批发机构增多，商品库存必然分散。因此，农村商品总库存额虽然增大，但由于分散的原故，影响全国调配不灵。
    国营商业下伸农村的批发机构，多是业务清淡，有些业务人员无事可做，就经常睡大觉、打扑克，群众称这样的公司为“娱乐公司”。这种业务清淡的情况使人有理由估计赔钱的批发点不在少数。如河北正定县曲阳桥百货批发组仅从1955年5月到12月，就赔了二千零八十六元。浙江商业厅认为，1956年的费用水平高于1955年，主要是因国营批发机构下伸引起的。
    第二，县以下原有的正常的商品流转规律遭到破坏。首先，增加了流转环节。从浙江省商业厅材料看，批发机构下伸集镇后，上海的产品一般要从中央站经过二级站、县公司、集镇批发点，才能到零售单位。如果是兼营商品，还要加上从主营公司到兼营公司一道环节。这就比从前多一至二道环节。其次，批发点设置往往不合理。如江苏苏州市郊冉直、唯亭、车坊、湘城四个点过去一直由上海或昆山进货，这是合乎流转规律的。但现在改从上海至苏州，再分到各点。环节增多了，商品倒流了三十到七十华里，因而加大了费用。
    第三，商品品种不全，数量不足的现象更严重了。国营商业集镇批发组人员少，核定的资金不多，又无权向外地进货，库存商品数量和品种、花色比县公司少得多。如广东省和平县百货公司经营二万五千种商品，但各批发组一般只有五百多种。这样少的品种是满足不了零售单位进货需要的。湖南邵东县范家山供销社3月10日要进货五十五种，当地百货批发商店只有三十一种。国营批发机构在资金限制于较小的定额内，要保证数量，品种必然要减少；要使品种全，每种货的数量便不能满足购货者的要求。要使品种和数量都有保证，资金定额必须大大增加。随之，库存积压和分散的程度也要大大增加。这个矛盾显然是不好解决的。
    商业机构的设置还必须有利于加强对市场的管理。特别是自由市场开放后，这个作用就更为重要。但国营批发机构下伸后，小商贩都按主管行业归口领导了，但国营公司设在镇上无法领导散处四乡的小商贩。又因小商贩跨行跨业，也无法用控制货源的方法控制其经营额，因此小商贩各处钻空子，投机活动也较前大为增加。如山东益都朱崖镇小贩石德俭从周村用每刀四角七分的价钱买来黄表（迷信品），卖价一元五角，毛利达320％。口埠区不少小贩从县城套购自行车高价出售，还有的把废茶叶晒干后和好茶叶掺在一起卖。可见，这个作法也削弱了市场的领导力量。也有的地区国营批发机构下伸后，只负责对私商批发业务，而对他们改造仍由供销社负责。经验证明这也不是好办法。因为供销社不能掌握货源，改造只是一句空话。
    但是，坚持主张国营批发机构下伸到集镇的同志说“优点大于缺点，下伸还是正确的。”他们有几个基本论点。
    第一个论点是：“国营批发机构下伸后，可以解决因供销社不积极进货而造成的一方面国营库存庞大，另一方面市场脱销的问题”。事实是怎样的呢？从1954年到1956年，供销社几种主要商品在全国范围内库存量超出定额储备参考指标一倍以上，特别是百货类商品，竟超出两倍以上；几年来库存额上升也很快。因此，无论如何得不出供销社不积极进货的结论。
    当然，有些商店真的积压了商品，也是事实。河北正定县百货公司经理说：主要是由于公司不计算盈亏，没有核定资金，存有供给制思想，盲目进货所致。这个公司1955年全年销货五十万元，但年底库存高达八十万元。像这样大的积压，就是商品大量下放，也是解决不了的。至于脱销现象，应该说在很多商业部门都普遍存在。但其发生原因，在若干主要商品上是因国家生产不足，而一般商品脱销则多半由于商业方面的措施不当。在后一个原因中，固然由于有的基层社很保守，不愿积极试销新商品，个别甚至听商品长期脱销不想办法进货；但更主要的则在于国营公司调剂不好，库存商品的品种和数量不能满足供销社需要。进入去年下半年后，后者的原因显得更突出了。
    第二个论点是：“批发机构下伸，可以更直接地了解群众需要情况，可以更方便地向生产部门提出改进生产品的意见”。了解消费者需要的一般运动公式是：零售商店——批发站——生产部门。后两个单位对群众需要的了解，主要依靠零售部门的材料。因此，批发部门要深入。广泛地了解这些材料，首先而且最重要的是改善同零售部门的联系制度，双方主动结合，做到零售单位有材料能及时向批发单位反映（在这方面，黑龙江省绥棱县创造了比较好的经验）。因此，这是一个工作制度和工作方法问题，而不是体制上的问题。
    第三个论点：“批发机构下伸后，可以解决因供销社力量不足，小商贩进货不便的问题。”首先应该提出，说小商贩进货不便，这不是事实。这可以从供销社对商贩批发业务的开展情况得到证实。1955年供销合作社系统有三万一千个商店，对私商批发了十八亿元的商品。1956年进一步增加到三万六千个商店搞批发，批发额也增到二十八亿元。比起国营公司只有九千七百多个批发商店来说，力量显然是强多了。
    其次，批发机构下伸后，小商贩进货倒是不方便了。在公司机构下伸后，不许供销社批发的地区，有不少商贩不愿再做买卖了。广东番禺竹寮圩小商贩过去进货不出村，国营批发机构下伸后，得跑到钟落潭去进货，来往三十多里。有的批发组在自己货不全的时候，还无理限制商贩从外地进货。这些都影响商贩经营的积极性。
    最后一个论点：“供销合作社是集体所有制企业，利润不上缴国库。国营批发机构下伸后，可以变零售利润为批发利润，充实国库收入。”应该指出，供销合作社虽是集体所有制企业，但它也同样是社会主义性质的企业；利润虽不直接上缴国库，但交纳所得税实质上仍是利润上缴，只是形式不同罢了。1957年基层社的利润收入平均将有百分之六十五左右作为所得税上交国库。县社以上企业单位的所得税率还要大些。把批发环节的费用变为零售部门的利润，再上缴，对国家难道不是更好吗？
    而另一方面，很多国营批发机构下伸后，虽然把零售利润变成了批发利润，但因开支大、业务小，还是赔钱，而这才是真正不利于充实国库收入的。
    有些国营商业部门看到了批发机构下伸后问题颇多，便提出以批发机构兼营零售、进一步接收原供销社的工业品、副食品零售店的办法来解决困难。湖南、广东等很多地方已经这样作了，有的地方正准备这样作。这显然是不妥当的。
    根据上面所述情况，我认为在当前强调国营批发机构下伸到集镇这一措施，是不适宜的。为了改进农村工业品的供应工作，以适应工农业生产的发展和人民消费品增长的需要，目前的问题不是批发机构下伸，而是如何加强供销合作社的业务，密切国营和合作社商业工作联系的问题。
