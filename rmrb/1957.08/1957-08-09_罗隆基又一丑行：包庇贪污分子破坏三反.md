Xinhua News Agency, August 8th. According to recent revelations by Chen Shuwen from the Jiangxi Guildhall, Luo Longji occupied the Jiangxi Guildhall, openly shielded embezzlers, and undermined the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Campaigns.

Chen Shuwen, who has lived in the Jiangxi Guildhall for more than 20 years, told reporters that since Luo Longji became the director of the Jiangxi Guildhall in the autumn of 1951, the Jiangxi Guildhall had become the Luo family's world. Luo Longji's elder brother, Luo Zhaorui, served as the general manager and handled everything. He made a mess of the Jiangxi Guildhall, and the masses were filled with complaints. Although some upright committee members existed, they dared to be angry but dared not speak out. Chen Shuwen said that the Jiangxi Guildhall had more assets than any other guildhall, but they were all squandered by Luo Longji, his relatives, friends, and those who flattered Luo Longji. In 1954, the Beijing Civil Affairs Bureau, in order to correct the unreasonable phenomenon of high and low rents in the guildhalls, formulated and distributed adjusted rent standards to each guildhall for reference. However, Luo Longji emphasized the special nature of fellow villagers and adjusted the rent by 30% off for all fellow villagers. Other guildhalls questioned why the Jiangxi Guildhall was not implementing the standards, which greatly affected the work of adjusting rents in the guildhalls.

In 1952, during the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Campaigns, the masses of the Jiangxi Guildhall exposed more than 20 embezzlers in the guildhall, including Luo Zhaorui, Luo Longji's elder brother. After more than a month of Three-Anti education, these embezzlers had recognized their mistakes and had written confessions, some of whom also made plans to return the embezzled money. At this time, as the stage of investigating and dealing with embezzlers was about to begin, Luo Longji returned from his vacation in the Western Hills. When he heard that the Jiangxi Guildhall was carrying out the Three-Anti Campaign and that it was targeting his elder brother, he was furious. He immediately notified the committee members of the guildhall (most of whom were embezzlers or people who sympathized with embezzlers) to hold a meeting at his home. In front of those embezzlers, he questioned the active members of the committee, saying, "Why are you making such a mess? You are going too far to the left." Luo Longji also believed that the government's Three-Anti Campaign in the Jiangxi Guildhall was biased and should not be carried out in this way. His reasons were: (1) The use of public funds by those who manage the guildhall is historical and should not be equated with embezzlement; (2) The Three-Anti Campaign should involve persuasion and education and should not be carried out too intensely; (3) The Three-Anti Campaign in the guildhall should be based on fellow villagers, and non-fellow villagers participating is illegal; (4) There are many guildhalls in Beijing, so why is the Three-Anti Campaign being carried out specifically in the Jiangxi Guildhall? Luo Longji also tried his best to defend the embezzlers. He even illegally read the state's unpublished regulations on punishing embezzlement to the embezzlers. As a result, the next day, all the embezzlers retracted their confessions and echoed Luo Longji's cry that "the government is going too far to the left." At the same time, they also frantically attacked and retaliated against the active members of the Three-Anti Campaign, causing serious damage to the achievements of the Three-Anti Campaign in the Jiangxi Guildhall over the past month.

Later, the active members of the Jiangxi Guildhall jointly wrote a letter to Mayor Peng Zhen, asking if they had made a mistake in carrying out the Three-Anti Campaign. Mayor Peng Zhen met with these active members (including Chen Shuwen). He encouraged them, saying that it was correct to carry out the Three-Anti Campaign and that there was no mistake and that it should be carried out. He also told these active members that he had asked Luo Longji, and Luo Longji said, "The Three-Anti Campaign is correct, and everyone has not made a mistake."

Chen Shuwen said, "Luo Longji is such a two-faced person who says different things to different people, saying high-sounding words in front of Mayor Peng Zhen, thinking that the Three-Anti Campaign is correct, but behind his back he shields embezzlers and undermines the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Campaigns."

### 罗隆基又一丑行：包庇贪污分子破坏三反

    罗隆基又一丑行：包庇贪污分子破坏三反
    新华社8日讯　根据江西会馆群众陈淑文最近揭发，罗隆基霸占江西会馆，公开包庇贪污分子，破坏三反、五反运动。
    在江西会馆住了二十多年的陈淑文对记者说，自从1951年秋罗隆基担任了江西会馆的主任委员以后，江西会馆就成了罗家的天下。罗隆基的哥哥罗兆瑞当总干事，一切事情由罗兆瑞包办，他把江西会馆搞得一团糟，群众怨声载道，虽然有些正派的委员，也是敢怒而不敢言。陈淑文说，江西会馆的财产比那一个会馆都多，但是却被罗隆基和他的亲戚朋友以及吹拍罗隆基的人搞光了。1954年，北京市民政局为了纠正会馆内的房租偏高偏低不合理的现象，曾制定了调整租金标准，并且印发给各会馆参照施行，而罗隆基强调同乡的特殊性，凡是同乡都按七折调整。其他的会馆提出质问，为什么江西会馆不按标准执行？致使会馆调整房租的工作受到很大影响。
    1952年，三反、五反运动中，江西会馆群众检举出这个馆里的贪污分子二十多名，其中有罗隆基的哥哥罗兆瑞。这些贪污分子们经过了一个多月的三反教育，已认识到自己的错误，并且都写了坦白书，有的还作出退赃的计划。这时，正在进入研究、处理贪污分子的阶段，罗隆基从西山休养回来，听说江西会馆搞三反，并且反到他的哥哥头上了，就大发雷霆，马上通知这个会馆的委员（其中大多数是贪污分子或同情贪污分子的人）在他家里开会。当着那些贪污分子的面质问委员中的积极分子说：“你们为什么这样乱搞？你们搞得太左了。”并且罗隆基认为政府在江西会馆搞三反有偏差，不应该这样搞。他的理由是：（1）管理会馆的人使用公款是有历史性的，不应和贪污问题相提并论；（2）搞三反应该是说服教育，不应搞的太过火了；（3）会馆内搞三反应该以同乡为基础，非同乡参加是不合法的；（4）全北京市的会馆很多，为什么专在江西会馆搞三反？罗隆基还极力为贪污分子辩护，他甚至于还把国家未公布的惩治贪污条例违法地读给贪污分子听。这样一来，第二天贪污分子全部翻案了，并且跟着罗隆基叫喊“政府搞左了。”同时，还疯狂地对三反中的积极分子进行打击、报复，致使江西会馆一个多月的三反成果遭到严重的破坏。
    后来，江西会馆的积极分子联名写信给彭真市长，问他们搞三反是否搞错了？彭真市长接见了这些积极分子（其中有陈淑文），他鼓励他们说，搞三反是正确的，没有错，应该搞。并且还告诉这些积极分子说，他已经问了罗隆基，罗隆基说：“三反是对的，大家没有搞错。”
    陈淑文说，“罗隆基就是这样一个看什么人讲什么话的阳奉阴违的两面派，当着彭真市长的面说得冠冕堂皇认为三反是对的，但背后却包庇贪污分子，破坏三反五反运动。”
