    Do Not Repeatedly Use Geological Exploration Forces
    In China, the departments currently engaged in geological work, in addition to the Ministry of Geology, also include the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, the Ministry of Chemical Industry, the Ministry of Building Materials Industry, the Ministry of Coal Industry, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, and the Ministry of Chemical Industry. These departments all have geological survey and exploration tasks. However, due to unclear division of labor and insufficient cooperation, the phenomenon of overlapping work areas often occurs, seriously wasting limited human and material resources. Last year, relevant parties once counted that there were as many as twenty-one areas where the work of the Ministry of Geology, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, and the Ministry of Coal Industry overlapped.
    Here are a few prominent examples of the survey aspect:
    In southern Guangdong, two survey teams from different units met in the field. Neither side would give way, and in the end, they had to ask the Provincial Party Committee to mediate. They used a mountain in the mining area as the boundary and forcibly divided a mineral deposit.
    In Daqingshan, Inner Mongolia, staff members of a geological team from one ministry hastily did some preliminary work in the field. Without making a definitive assessment of the mining area, they left. However, they stuck their pickaxes and shovels into an unfinished exploration trench as a marker to claim the territory, to prevent another team from coming here to work after them.
    In western Zhejiang, a geological team even sent armed guards to stand guard, not allowing another team to go there.
    In a certain township in Hebei, an ancient silver cave with no economic value was visited by five field teams one after another in one year.
    In terms of geological exploration, there are countless similar incidents.
    For example, the coal-bearing strata in Shanxi Province can be said to be densely distributed throughout the province. Although the Ministry of Geology and the Ministry of Coal Industry had previously negotiated and divided the work areas, recently, the two sides are arguing over the work issue in the Xiangning area. On the other hand, there are fewer coalfields south of the Yangtze River, and the structure is more complex. However, there are also ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgical bases there, which urgently need coking coal and power coal, and exploration work for coal mines should be strengthened. However, the Ministry of Geology and the Ministry of Coal Industry would rather invest their strength in places where they are arguing.
    Aren't the management agencies also duplicated? The Ministry of Geology has geological bureaus or directly affiliated offices in each province (or autonomous region). The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the Ministry of Coal Industry, and the Ministry of Petroleum Industry have various specialized geological bureaus equivalent to large regions. In addition, there are also geological systems under some provincial industrial departments. They all undertake survey and exploration tasks, and they are generally large organizations with overlapping layers.
    This phenomenon should not continue to develop. I suggest that the State Planning Commission and the Economic Commission immediately convene relevant departments to study this issue, or organize a special committee to completely resolve it. First of all, it is necessary to clarify the division of labor and stipulate the basic tasks and development directions of each ministry. In this regard, the Soviet experience can be referred to and adopted. In the Soviet Union, national regional geological surveys, mineral surveys, preliminary exploration, and detailed exploration are comprehensively planned and carried out by a specialized ministry - the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources. This ministry has an All-Union Information Bureau, which is responsible for collecting and synthesizing national geological and mineral information, and registering the geological work of various ministries to avoid duplication of work areas. As for other industrial departments, they only carry out development exploration, mine geology, and corresponding geological surveys and exploration work within a certain range outside the mining area. If we can do this, those unreasonable duplicate phenomena can be basically eliminated. Of course, this work is very meticulous and very complex and cannot be achieved overnight. However, at present, a final resolution should and can be made on the already duplicated work areas, and no more time should be delayed to affect the work.

### 不要重复使用地质勘探力量

    不要重复使用地质勘探力量
    我国目前从事地质工作的部门，除地质部以外，还有冶金工业部、石油工业部、化学工业部、建筑材料工业部和煤炭工业部、冶金工业部、石油工业部和化学工业部。这些部门都有地质普查和勘探任务。但是，由于分工不明、协作不够，经常发生工作地区重复的现象，严重地浪费了有限的人力和物力。去年，有关方面曾经统计过，仅地质部、冶金工业部和煤炭工业部三个部工作重复的地区就有二十一处。
    先举几个普查方面的比较突出的例子：
    在广东南部，有两个不同单位的普查队在野外相遇，双方互不相让，最后不得不请省委出面调解，以矿区的一个山头为界，把一个矿体硬给分了家。
    在内蒙古大青山，有一个部的地质小队工作人员，匆忙地在野外做了一些初步工作，没对矿区作出一定的评价就走了。但是，他们却把铁镐铁锹等工具插在一个未完成的探槽中，作为占地盘的标记，以防备在他们后面的另一个队到这里来工作。
    在浙西，有一个地质队竟派武装警卫站岗放哨，不准另一队去。
    河北某乡有个没有经济价值的古银峒，在一年中陆续有五个野外队到那里去检查。
    在地质勘探方面，这一类的事也是不胜枚举的。
    例如，山西省的煤系地层可说密布全境，地质部和煤炭工业部尽管过去曾经协商过，划分了工作地区，但近来为了乡宁地区的工作问题，双方正在扯皮。另一方面，长江以南的煤田既少，构造又较复杂，而那里同样有黑色和有色金属冶金基地，亟需炼焦煤和动力煤，正应加强煤矿的勘探工作。但是，地质部和煤炭部却宁愿把它们的力量投在扯皮的地方。
    管理机构何尝没有重复呢？地质部有各省（或自治区）的地质局或直属办事处，冶金工业部、煤炭工业部和石油工业部有相当于大区的各种专业地质局，此外还有一些省工业厅所属的地质系统。它们都负担着普查勘探任务，一般都是机构庞大、层次重叠。
    这种现象不应当再发展下去了。我建议国家计划委员会和经济委员会立即召集有关部门研究这个问题，或者组织一个专门委员会来彻底解决。首先要明确分工，规定各部的基本任务和发展方针。在这方面，苏联的经验是可以参考采用的。在苏联，全国区域地质测量、矿产普查、初步勘探和详细勘探由专业部——地质保矿部——来全面规划和进行工作。这个部设有全苏资料局，负责搜集和综合全国地质矿产资料，并进行各部的地质工作的登记，以避免工作地区的重复。至于其它工业部门则只作开发勘探、矿山地质和在矿区外围一定范围内进行相应的地质普查和勘探工作。如果我们能这样做，那些不合理的重复现象就可以基本消除了。当然，这个工作很细致，很复杂，不能一跃而成。但是，目前应该而且可能对已经重复的工作地区作出最后决议，不要再拖延时间影响工作。
