Xinhua News Agency, 13th. Flood prevention is being intensified in rivers of Northeast China. Since late July, Northeast China has experienced frequent rainfall. Especially since the beginning of August, heavy and torrential rains have fallen continuously in the Songhua River and Liao River basins in Northeast China. Currently, the main streams and tributaries of both rivers are rising, with the water situation in the Taoer River being relatively tense. Due to the rising water level in the upper reaches of the Songhua River, the Fengman Reservoir has already opened its gates to discharge water on the 11th.

A small portion of farmland in Jilin and Liaoning has been affected by internal waterlogging. Drainage and emergency harvesting, or seedling rescue, are currently underway.

    东北各河加紧防汛
    据新华社13日讯　东北各河现在都在加紧防汛。7月下旬以来，东北各地频繁降雨，特别是进入8月以来，东北的松花江和辽河流域连降大雨和暴雨，现在两河的干支流都在涨水，其中洮儿河水情较紧张。由于松花江上游涨水，丰满水库已经在11日开闸放水。
    吉林、辽宁有小部分耕地受内水灾害，现在正在排水抢收或救苗。
