Xinhua News Agency, 7th - The Tongxian Special District, Hebei Province, a capital pig production base, held a pig-raising and animal husbandry production meeting from July 31st to August 4th.

The meeting pointed out that since Tongxian Special District was designated as a capital pig production base this spring, pig production has greatly developed. As of the end of June, the special district had a total of 603,161 pigs, an increase of 108,464 over March; and many "household pig-raising cooperatives" and "one pig per person cooperatives" have emerged. In Daxinzhai Village, Pinggu County, 81 cooperative members, excluding the four elderly and widowed households, all raised pigs. Now the village averages 4.7 pigs per household, not counting the 165 fat pigs and 300 piglets that have already been sold. Da Hou Village has already achieved one pig per person. Xiaoying Village, Daxing County, which suffered a major disaster last year, now averages 3.9 pigs per household.

In developing pig production, agricultural cooperatives in various parts of Tongxian Special District have organized members to use green grass and wild vegetables to feed pigs, adjusted the price of pig manure entering the cooperative, helped members repair pig pens, and hauled soil and collected manure. Some agricultural cooperatives have also carried out pig insurance work in the spirit of helping each other. These measures have stimulated the enthusiasm of farmers to raise pigs in large numbers.

The meeting determined the overall special district's pig development plan for 1957 to 1962. According to this plan, the number will increase to 800,000 by the end of this year and to 1.8 million by the end of 1962, averaging three pigs per household. After this plan is realized, in addition to meeting the local farmers' consumption of pork, it can supply the people of the capital with 800,000 fat pigs every year, basically meeting the capital's needs for meat. At the same time, it can accumulate 27 billion catties of pig manure a year, and the special district's cultivated land can be fertilized with an average of 2,800 catties of pig manure per mu. Together with miscellaneous fertilizers, an average of 4,000 catties of fertilizer can be applied per mu. Increased agricultural production will be powerfully guaranteed.

    通县专区召开养猪生产会议
    1962年可供应首都肥猪八十万头
    据新华社7日讯　7月31日到8月4日首都生猪生产基地河北省通县专区召开了养猪畜牧生产会议。
    会议指出，通县专区自从今年春天划为首都生猪生产基地以后，生猪生产有了很大的发展。截至6月底止，全专区共有猪六十万三千一百六十一头，比3月份增加十万八千四百六十四头；并出现了不少“户户养猪社”和“一人一猪社”。平谷县大辛寨村八十一户社员，除去孤、寡的四户以外，其余全部养了猪。现在全村平均每户养猪四点七头，已经卖出的一百六十五头肥猪和三百头仔猪还不计算在内。大后村已经合到一人一头猪了。去年遭受重灾的大兴县小营村现在平均每户养猪也达到三点九头。
    在发展生猪生产中，通县专区各地农业社都组织社员利用青草、野菜喂猪，调整猪粪入社价格，帮助社员修盖猪圈以及拉土、起粪等。有的农业社还本着百家帮一家的精神，举办了生猪保险工作。这些措施激发了农民大量养猪的积极性。
    会议确定了1957年到1962年全专区的生猪发展计划。按照这个计划，到今年年底将发展到八十万头；到1962年年底将发展到一百八十万头，平均每户养三头。这个计划实现以后，除可以满足当地农民对猪肉的消费外，每年可以供给首都人民八十万头肥猪，基本上满足首都人民对肉食的需要。同时，一年可以积猪粪二百七十亿斤，全专区的耕地平均每亩可以施猪粪二千八百斤。加上杂肥，平均每亩可以施肥四千斤。农业增产将得到有力的保证。
