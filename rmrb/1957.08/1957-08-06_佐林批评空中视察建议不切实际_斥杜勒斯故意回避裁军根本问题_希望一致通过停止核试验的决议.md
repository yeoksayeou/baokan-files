Xinhua News Agency, London, August 4th: According to TASS, at the Disarmament Subcommittee meeting on August 2nd, Soviet representative Zorin criticized Dulles for deliberately evading fundamental disarmament issues, such as the banning of nuclear weapons and the reduction of conventional armaments.

Speaking about Dulles' proposal regarding measures to prevent surprise attacks, Zorin said that the Soviet Union was the first to raise this issue, and the Soviet delegation would carefully study the West's proposal regarding aerial inspection zones. He then said that, however, it could be stated in advance that this proposal would certainly raise some questions. For example, the proposed Arctic region includes thousands of kilometers of uninhabited land, let alone military installations, but the military bases of the United States, NATO, and the Manila Treaty Organization in North Africa, the Near East, Pakistan, Japan, and other countries are not included in any of the inspection zones mentioned in the Western proposal. And surprise attacks could come from various directions, not just one.

Zorin emphasized that the current task of the Disarmament Subcommittee is primarily to reach an agreement on the measures that need to be taken in reducing nuclear and conventional armaments. The first step in this regard should be an agreement to cease—even if only temporarily—testing atomic and hydrogen bombs and to establish international supervision of this measure. Zorin said that supervision of disarmament can only be meaningful when it is part of an overall plan of disarmament measures in conventional and nuclear armaments. Without being combined with clear and practical disarmament measures, the issues of supervision and inspection do not help solve the current main task. The essence of the disarmament issue is to abolish nuclear weapons and to substantially reduce armaments and armed forces.

Zorin drew everyone's attention to the Soviet government's proposal on June 14th regarding a two- to three-year cessation of atomic and hydrogen bomb tests under international supervision. Zorin then criticized the attitude of the Western delegations in obstructing a separate agreement on the immediate cessation of nuclear testing. The West insists on linking this issue with the resolution of the reduction of armed forces, especially the cessation of the production of fissionable materials for military purposes.

Zorin concluded by saying, "We hope that the representatives participating in the negotiations will pay attention to the demands of the people of all countries and pass a unanimous resolution on the cessation of testing atomic and hydrogen weapons as a first step towards stopping the expansion of nuclear armaments, paving the way for various partial measures in disarmament in the future."

    佐林批评空中视察建议不切实际
    斥杜勒斯故意回避裁军根本问题
    希望一致通过停止核试验的决议
    据新华社4日讯　据塔斯社伦敦讯：在8月2日裁军小组委员会会议上，苏联代表佐林发言批评杜勒斯故意回避禁止核武器和裁减常规军备这些裁军方面的根本问题。
    佐林在谈到杜勒斯所提出的关于防止突然攻击的措施的建议时说，这个问题是苏联第一个提出来的，苏联代表团将仔细地研究杜勒斯提出的西方关于空中视察区的建议。他接着说，不过，现在就可以事先说明，这一建议一定会引起一些问题。例如，建议中包括的北极区，那是个数千公里不见人烟的地方，更不用谈军事工事了，可是美国、北大西洋公约组织和马尼拉条约组织在北非、近东、巴基斯坦、日本以及其他国家中的军事基地却不包括在西方建议提到的任何一个视察区之内。而突击可能来自各个不同的方面，不只是一个方面。
    佐林强调指出，裁军小组委员会当前的任务，主要是就在裁减原子核和常规军备方面需要采取的措施取得协议。在这方面的第一步应当是大家协议停止——即使只是暂时停止——试验原子弹和氢弹和建立对这个措施的国际监督。佐林说，对裁军的监督只有在它是在常规和原子军备方面的裁军措施的总计划的一部分的时候才能有意义。如果不结合明确的实际裁军措施，监督、视察问题无助于解决当前的主要任务。裁军问题的实质是要废弃核武器和大规模裁减军备和武装部队。
    佐林让大家注意苏联政府在6月14日提出的关于在国际监督的条件下停止试验原子弹和氢弹两三年的建议。佐林接着批评西方国家代表团阻挠单独就立即停止核试验问题达成协议的态度。西方坚持要把这个问题同裁减武装部队、尤其是停止生产军用的分裂物质问题的解决联在一起。
    佐林最后说，我们希望，参加谈判的代表们能重视各国人民发出的要求，就停止试验原子武器和氢武器问题通过一项一致协议的决议，作为走向停止扩充原子军备的第一步，为今后在裁军方面采取种种局部措施开辟道路。
