The three American officers also visited the remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's troops in northeastern Burma. They were accompanied by Chiang Kai-shek officers throughout their activities.

    美蒋军官搞阴谋活动
    据新华社新德里17日电  据最近一期“闪电”周报报道，美国和蒋军军官在印缅边境那加山区附近进行阴谋活动。
    这家报纸援引同曼谷东南亚条约组织总部有联系的权威人士的话说，美国驻泰国联合军事援助团的三名高级军官最近“根据华盛顿的指示”到印缅边境进行“视察”，企图煽动那加族的武装活动，并且在印度边境的阿萨姆邦和曼尼普尔地方以武器和弹药供应那加族。这三名美国军官还访问了缅甸东北部的蒋军残余军队。他们一路上都有蒋军军官陪同活动。
