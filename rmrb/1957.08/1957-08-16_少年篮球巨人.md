Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, August 15th: A "teenage basketball giant" who has appeared on the basketball courts of Zhengzhou in recent days has aroused great interest among basketball enthusiasts.

This "teenage basketball giant" is named Zhang Guanglu. He is only sixteen years old this year, but his height is 1.98 meters and his weight is 91 kilograms. His height is the same as that of Ju Fen Kang, the tallest center on the Chinese youth men's basketball team that participated in the Third International Youth Friendship Games.

Zhang Guanglu is a member of the Guangzhou Youth Basketball Team and is currently in Zhengzhou to participate in the Zhengzhou competition zone of the first stage of the 1957 National Youth Basketball Championship. He plays center. During the game, he often stands under the basket, waving his large hands, snatching rebounds from over the heads of others. His young opponents often just watch him "put" the ball into the basket, helpless.

Zhang Guanglu is from Hainan Island and is the son of a farmer. He has only been practicing basketball for five months, but he has made rapid progress and appears to be a promising basketball player.

    “少年篮球巨人”
    新华社郑州15日电  这几天在郑州市篮球场上出现的一个“少年篮球巨人”，引起了篮球爱好者们很大兴趣。
    这个“少年篮球巨人”叫张光禄，今年刚刚十六岁，但是身高却有一公尺九十八公分，体重九十一公斤。他的身高已同参加第三届国际青年友谊运动会的中国青年男子篮球队最高的中锋鞠汾康一样。
    张光禄是广州市少年篮球代表队的队员，目前正在郑州参加1957年全国少年篮球锦标赛第一阶段郑州竞赛区的比赛。他是打中锋的。在比赛时，他经常矗立篮下，挥舞着两只大手，从别人的头顶上摘取遮板球。他的年轻的对手们还常常是看着他把球“放”进篮内，而无可奈何。
    张光禄是海南岛人，是一个农民的儿子。他练习打篮球只不过五个月，但进步很快，看来是一个很有培养前途的篮球运动员。
