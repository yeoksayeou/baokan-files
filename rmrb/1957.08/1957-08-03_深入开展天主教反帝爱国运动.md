Editorial:

    The recent Chinese Catholic Representatives Conference, attended by 241 bishops, vicars, and lay representatives from over 100 dioceses across 26 provinces and cities nationwide, was broadly representative. The conference discussed significant issues such as the question of which road to take, the issue of purging counter-revolutionaries within the Church, the question of the patriotic anti-imperialist movement of Chinese Catholics, the relationship between Chinese Catholics and the Vatican, and religious policies. It involved lively debates, refuted many erroneous statements, and engaged in a serious struggle against right-wing elements within the Church. After repeated discussions, the representatives reached a consensus. They expressed that Chinese Catholics, together with the people of the entire nation, are determined to follow the socialist road under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party; they must unite and continue to deepen the patriotic anti-imperialist movement, actively participate in the socialist construction of the motherland, and defend world peace.

    The question of the relationship between Chinese Catholics and the Vatican was one of the important topics on the agenda of this conference. The representatives further exposed the various reactionary statements and political conspiracies of the Vatican against our country in the past and present. They fundamentally drew a clear line between Chinese Catholics and the Vatican in terms of political allegiance and affirmed that Chinese Catholicism must be independently and autonomously managed by Chinese Catholics in religious affairs. This is a fundamental policy issue.

    The relationship between Chinese Catholics and the Vatican involves two fundamentally opposed political stances. The Vatican is an instrument of imperialist aggression. American imperialism politically and economically controls the Vatican, using it to serve its aggressive policies. The Vatican has consistently been anti-communist, anti-Soviet, and opposed to people's democratic countries, especially adopting a hostile attitude towards our country. Not only did the Vatican long exploit Chinese Catholics as a tool of colonialism before our liberation, but after liberation, it still attempted to continue using Chinese Catholics as a tool for imperialism to oppose our socialist cause. The Vatican, on the one hand, recognizes the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan, and on the other hand, instructs and supports imperialist elements and counter-revolutionaries hidden within the Church to carry out various conspiracies and sabotage activities against our country. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Vatican has issued several secret "encyclicals" and orders. Such as the "Encyclical to Chinese Catholics" on January 18, 1952, and the "Encyclical to Chinese Archbishops and Other Diocesan Priests and Faithful Adhering to the Apostolic See" on October 7, 1954, all aimed at inciting Chinese Catholics to oppose the People's Government, oppose the Communist Party, and undermine our country's socialist cause. When Chinese Catholics launched the patriotic anti-imperialist movement, the Vatican used its religious authority to punish patriotic clergy and believers with measures such as so-called "deprivation of priestly powers," "suspension of divine functions," and "excommunication," attempting to obstruct and suppress the patriotic anti-imperialist movement of Chinese Catholics. These facts have made it very clear to patriotic Catholics: the actions of the Catholic Church far away in the Vatican have obviously exceeded the scope of religious activities. It uses religion to conduct reactionary activities, interfere in our internal affairs, infringe upon our sovereignty, and also infringe upon the religious freedom of Chinese Catholics. Can this be tolerated?

    Many patriotic Catholics in our country have long expressed their determination to draw a line with the Vatican. Now, after this representatives' conference, they have a deeper understanding that in order to safeguard their own religious beliefs, they must further develop the patriotic anti-imperialist movement, and must establish a national patriotic organization—the "Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association." Through this organization, they will unite Catholics across the country, mobilize the patriotic enthusiasm of three million Catholics, and serve the socialist cause of the motherland. However, just as the Chinese Catholic Representatives Conference was being held, the Vatican authorities on the one hand issued messages slandering and undermining the "Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association," forbidding believers from participating, and forbidding believers from participating in any organization under the leadership of the Communist Party, otherwise they would be subject to the most severe "excommunication" (expulsion from the Church); it also demanded that believers "shed blood and sacrifice their lives" to realize its political conspiracies. At the same time, the Vatican ordered the Shanghai Catholic Church to once again deny the legitimacy of Zhang Shilang, the acting bishop of the diocese, attempting to open a gap in Shanghai and prepare to attack patriotic Catholic churches in various parts of China in the future, in order to realize its conspiracy to continue using Chinese Catholics to conduct anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist activities. However, the Vatican miscalculated. Its absurd and arrogant reactionary orders immediately aroused the immense indignation of the representatives attending the conference and were unanimously denounced. The representatives also lodged a solemn protest. This just and patriotic behavior of Chinese Catholics will surely receive strong support from the people of the whole country.

    Chinese Catholics have every right to run the Chinese Catholic Church independently. The Chinese Catholic Church must not only sever all political and economic ties with the Vatican, but also require the Vatican to respect China's sovereignty, respect the due religious rights of the Chinese Catholic Church, and not arbitrarily interfere in the religious affairs of Chinese Catholics. Only on this basis can the Chinese Catholic Church establish certain religious connections with the Vatican without losing its patriotic stance, without harming China's sovereignty and the interests of the people, and in a manner conducive to the Church's own religious affairs.

    This Chinese Catholic Representatives Conference was a great success. It further enhanced the political awareness of Catholic figures and determined the direction of future efforts to love the country and love the Church. The outcome of this conference shows that the patriotic anti-imperialist movement of Chinese Catholics is progressing. It is hoped that the representatives attending the conference will convey the spirit and resolutions of the conference to clergy and believers across the country. Everyone should strive to strengthen unity, overcome difficulties, work hard, and advance the patriotic anti-imperialist movement of Chinese Catholics a big step forward, so that Chinese Catholics can advance along the socialist path in step with the people of the whole country.

### 深入开展天主教反帝爱国运动

    深入开展天主教反帝爱国运动
    最近召开的中国天主教代表会议，参加者有全国二十六个省市，一百多个教区的主教、代主教、副主教、神甫和教徒代表共二百四十一人，代表性是很广泛的。会议讨论了两条道路问题、教会内的肃反问题、中国天主教徒反帝爱国运动的问题、中国天主教同梵蒂冈的关系问题以及宗教政策等重大问题，进行了热烈的争辩，驳斥了许多错误言论，并且同教会内的右派分子进行了严肃的斗争。到会的代表们经过了反复讨论之后，终于达到了一致的认识。他们表示中国天主教徒一定同全国人民一道，在中国共产党的领导下走社会主义的道路；一定要团结一致，继续深入开展反帝爱国运动，积极参加祖国的社会主义建设事业，保卫世界和平。
    关于中国天主教同梵蒂冈的关系问题，是这次会议的重要议题之一。代表们进一步揭露了梵蒂冈过去和现在对我国的种种反动言论和政治阴谋，基本上划清了中国天主教同梵蒂冈在政治上的敌我界限，确定在宗教上中国天主教必须由中国天主教徒独立自主地自办。这是一个根本的方针问题。
    中国天主教同梵蒂冈的关系问题，是牵涉到两个根本对立的政治立场问题。梵蒂冈是帝国主义的侵略工具。美帝国主义在政治上经济上控制梵蒂冈，利用梵蒂冈为它的侵略政策服务。梵蒂冈一贯反共、反苏、反对人民民主国家，特别是对我国一贯采取敌视的态度。梵蒂冈不仅在我国解放前就长期利用中国天主教为殖民主义的侵略工具，而且在解放后仍然力图继续利用中国天主教作为帝国主义反对我国社会主义事业的工具。梵蒂冈一方面承认台湾的蒋介石集团，另一方面指使和支持暗藏在教会内的帝国主义分子和反革命分子，对我国进行各种阴谋破坏活动。从中华人民共和国成立以来，梵蒂冈发出的秘密的“通谕”和命令就有好几起。如1952年1月18日的“致中国天主教徒通谕”、1954年10月7日的“致中国总主教和其余教区司铎及服膺宗座的信友通谕”等，都是以煽动中国天主教徒反对人民政府、反对共产党、破坏我国的社会主义事业为目的的。当着中国天主教徒展开了反帝爱国运动的时候，梵蒂冈就利用它的宗教职权，以所谓“摘神权”、“停神功”、“弃绝”等手段来处罚爱国的神职人员和教徒，企图借此阻挠和打击中国天主教徒的反帝爱国运动。这些事实，使爱国的天主教徒看得很清楚：远在梵蒂冈的天主教会的所作所为，显然已经超出了宗教活动的范围。它利用宗教进行反动活动，干涉我国内政，侵犯我国主权，也侵犯了我国天主教徒的宗教信仰自由。这难道是可以容忍的吗？
    我国的许多爱国的天主教徒早就已经表示了他们的决心，要同梵蒂冈划清界限。现在，他们经过了这一次代表会议，更深刻地体会到，为了维护自己的宗教信仰，必须进一步开展反帝爱国运动，必须建立全国性的爱国组织——“中国天主教友爱国会”。他们将通过这个组织，去团结全国的天主教徒，调动三百万天主教徒的爱国的积极性，为祖国的社会主义事业服务。可是，正当中国天主教代表会议举行的时候，梵蒂冈当局一方面发出消息，诬蔑和破坏“中国天主教友爱国会”，不准教徒参加，并且不准教徒参加共产党领导下的任何组织，否则就要受到最严厉的“绝罚”（开除教籍）处分；它还要求教徒为实现它的政治阴谋而“流血致命”。同时，梵蒂冈又命令上海天主教会，再次否认该教区合法代理主教张士琅，企图从上海打开缺口，准备将来向中国各地爱国的天主教会进攻，以实现它继续利用中国天主教进行反共、反人民、反社会主义的阴谋。可是，梵蒂冈打错了算盘，它的这种荒谬而狂妄的反动命令，立即激起了参加这次会议的代表们的无比愤慨，受到了一致痛斥。代表们并提出了严正抗议。中国天主教徒的这种正义的爱国行为，一定会得到全国人民的大力支持。
    中国天主教徒完全有权自办中国的天主教会。中国天主教会不但要同梵蒂冈割断一切政治上和经济上的关系，而且要梵蒂冈尊重中国的主权，尊重中国天主教会在宗教上应有的权利，不得任意干涉中国天主教的教务。只有在这样的基础上，中国天主教才能够在不丧失爱国立场，不损害我国主权和人民利益，并且有利于教会本身教务的条件下，同梵蒂冈建立一定的宗教联系。
    这次中国天主教代表会议开得很好。它进一步提高了天主教人士的政治觉悟，确定了今后爱国爱教的努力方向。这个会议的结果表明，中国天主教的反帝爱国运动在前进。希望参加会议的代表们把会议的精神和决议传达到全国神职人员和教徒中去。大家努力加强团结，克服困难，努力工作，把中国天主教的反帝爱国运动向前推进一大步，让中国的天主教徒们都能够和全国人民步伐一致地沿着社会主义的大道前进。
