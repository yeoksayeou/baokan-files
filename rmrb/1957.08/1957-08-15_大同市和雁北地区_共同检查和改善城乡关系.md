Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, August 14th: Relevant leading organs in Datong City and Yanbei Area, Shanxi Province, recently jointly inspected and resolved the contradictions existing between urban and rural areas, further strengthening urban-rural relations.

Improving urban-rural relations was an important issue that the Party and government leading organs in Datong City and Yanbei Area paid attention to and resolved at the beginning of the rectification campaign. Both sides held an urban-rural liaison meeting in late June. According to the reflections at the meeting, the main contradictions in urban-rural relations in Datong City and Yanbei Area were the lack of planning for urban-rural material exchange. The supply of pork, eggs, and vegetables from rural areas to the city was inconsistent, and the varieties and patterns were not diverse enough to meet the needs of urban residents. The industrial products supplied by the city to the countryside also had phenomena that were not suitable for farming seasons and farmers' tastes. The units serving rural areas, such as hardware, transportation, electrical engineering equipment, and agricultural tool repair, were passive in their work, and the tools purchased by farmers often lacked parts, making repairs difficult. In addition, the over-rapid and excessive land occupation for industrial construction in the suburbs, coupled with slow construction progress, caused some farmland to be abandoned, arousing dissatisfaction among farmers. Farmers also had opinions on the shortcomings of urban commercial departments in the purchase of agricultural products, such as downgrading and price gouging, slow purchasing, and complicated procedures. In the past, the leading organs of Datong City and Yanbei Area lacked close contact, and the inspection and resolution of these problems were not timely, and at one point caused mutual complaints and "buck-passing."

In order to solve these problems, both parties put forward requirements and guarantees to each other at the meeting, determined the scope of urban pork procurement and supply, and delineated the distribution ratio of materials jointly needed by urban and rural areas. In order to ensure the smooth implementation of the above plans, a regular contact system was established.

Since July, many large enterprise leading units and factories in Datong City have dispatched cadres to visit various counties in Yanbei, listen to criticisms and suggestions, and study and correct shortcomings at any time. According to the requirements of Yanbei farmers, Datong Machine Factory sent technicians to help farmers repair bridges, boiler-trolley machines, and water pumps. Many handicraft cooperatives in Datong City also specially organized agricultural tool repair teams to go deep into various parts of Yanbei to help farmers repair agricultural tools. Datong Hardware, Transportation Electrical Engineering Equipment, Chemical Industry and other companies also invited commercial staff from various counties in Yanbei to hold discussions, visit warehouses, exchange information on sources of goods and sales, and study improvements in summer supply work. At the same time, the supply of pork and eggs from Yanbei rural areas to Datong City has also increased month by month, and farmers have also specially transferred more than 100,000 jin of mung bean flour and potato flour to supply Datong City workers.

### 大同市和雁北地区  共同检查和改善城乡关系

    大同市和雁北地区
    共同检查和改善城乡关系
    新华社太原14日电　山西省大同市和雁北地区有关领导机关，最近共同检查和解决城乡之间存在的矛盾，进一步密切了城乡关系。
    改善城乡关系是大同市和雁北地区党政领导机关在整风开始时就注意解决的一个重要问题。双方曾在6月下旬召开一次城乡联系会议。据会上反映，大同市和雁北地区城乡关系方面存在的主要矛盾，是城乡物资交流缺乏计划。乡村供应城市的猪肉、鸡蛋和蔬菜时多时少，品种花色不多，不能满足城市居民的需要。而城市供应农村的工业品，也存在不合农时和农民口味的现象。为农村服务的五金、交通电工器材、农具修造等单位，工作被动，农民购买的器具往往缺乏零件，修配起来困难。此外，城郊工业建设占地过急过多，而建筑进度慢，使部分田地荒芜，引起农民不满。农民还对城市商业部门在收购农产品方面存在的压级压价、收购迟缓、手续繁杂等缺点也有意见。大同市和雁北地区领导机关过去联系不密切，检查和解决这些问题不及时，而且一度造成互相埋怨和“扯皮”的现象。
    为了解决这些问题，会上双方互相提出了要求和保证的条件，确定了城市猪肉采购和供应范围，划定了城乡共同需要物资的分配比例，并且为了保证上述计划顺利实现，建立了经常联系的制度。
    7月份以来，大同市许多较大的企业领导单位和工厂都抽派干部到雁北各县访问，听取批评建议，随时研究改正缺点。大同机器厂根据雁北农民的要求，派出技术工人去帮助农民修桥、修锅驼机和水泵等。大同市许多手工业合作社，也专门组织农具修配小组深入雁北各地，帮助农民检修农具。大同市五金、交通电工器材、化工等公司还邀请雁北各县商业工作人员座谈，参观仓库，交流有关货源和销售的情况，研究改进夏季的供应工作。同时，雁北农村对大同市的猪肉、鸡蛋供应量也逐月增加，农民还特意调运十万多斤绿豆粉和土豆粉供应大同市职工。
