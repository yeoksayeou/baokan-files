This year's competition was held on the third weekend of May. The frogs participating in the competition are selected from all over the world. Among them, five frogs from Norway were specially trained. The conference has been held for thirty-one sessions, and twenty countries have applied to participate. (Yan)

    “跳蛙”的纪念
    为了纪念美国作家马克·吐温的小说“跳蛙”的创作，在美国加里福尼亚州英吉尔司卡普一年一度举行“青蛙跳技比赛大会”。今年的比赛大会已在5月的第三个周末举行。参加这次比赛的青蛙，都是从世界各地选送来的。其中自挪威来的五只是经过特别训练的。这个大会已举办过三十一届，有二十个国家申请参加。  （岩）
