Sichuan's 130 million mu of autumn grain crops and cotton are growing well. Barring unforeseen disasters, a comprehensive bumper harvest is expected. Currently, over 40 million mu of mid-season rice is generally heading, with some already yellowing and ripening. It is estimated that the yield per unit area can be increased by more than 4% compared to the bumper year of 1956. The province's plan to plant 8 million mu of late rice has been overfulfilled, and the early-planted late rice seedlings are thriving. Miscellaneous grain crops such as sweet potatoes and corn are also generally growing well. According to agricultural departments, the province's grain output is expected to increase significantly this year. The 5 million mu of cotton has begun to blossom and boll, and it is expected that the production increase plan can be completed. (Xinhua News Agency)
