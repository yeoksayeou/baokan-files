Law Publishing House Holds Continuous Meetings
Two Rightists Begin to Confess

(Our dispatch) The staff of the Law Publishing House have held continuous meetings to expose and criticize the anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds of Chen Ji and Wang Zongxian, editors and rightists within the publishing house.

The rightist Chen Ji extremely hated the socialist system, describing the lives of the people in the new society as "animal-like." He also said, "Now the entire regime has become a huge bureaucratic institution." He slandered the Communist Party members in the publishing house, saying, "You can't smell any 'Party flavor' from the Party members." He also cursed the activists as "braggarts and flatterers" and scolded the masses as "glass marbles," complaining that the masses did not join him in anti-Party activities.

After the start of the anti-rightist struggle, he repeatedly denied his reactionary words and deeds. After the masses exposed and criticized him, especially after revealing that he was a veteran traitor who had served as the Chief of the Higher Education Section and Commissioner of the puppet North China Education Bureau, exposing his criminal history of betraying the country for personal gain and his consistent anti-communist and anti-people reactionary nature, he was forced to begin confessing his crimes.

Another rightist in the publishing house, Wang Zongxian, expressed "full agreement" with Chu Anping's fallacy of a "Party-dominated world," and slandered Party members who disagreed with Chu Anping's fallacy, saying that they "have personal interests and are afraid of not being able to become leaders in the future." He also maliciously distorted the great guiding significance of Chairman Mao's report on the anti-rightist struggle, saying, "Now we are at a critical juncture, and this report is being used to defuse the situation."

Wang Zongxian also took advantage of the opportunity of the publishing house convening a symposium of people from outside the organization to set fire to the meeting. He put forward an absurd argument, saying, "The imperfection of the legal system is the main root of contradictions among the people," and falsely accused, "From the central level, there are violations of laws and discipline, and the local deviations are even greater." Under the comrades' righteous questioning, Wang Zongxian had to admit his mistakes, while also revealing some new reactionary views. The struggle against Wang Zongxian in the publishing house is now expanding its results.

    法律出版社连日集会
    两个右派分子开始认罪
    本报讯  法律出版社工作人员连日集会揭发批判了该社编辑人员、右派分子陈佶、王宗贤的反党反社会主义言行。
    右派分子陈佶极端仇视社会主义制度，他把新社会的人民的生活说成是“牛马般”的生活。还说“现在整个政权机构成了一个庞大的官僚机构”。诬蔑该社的共产党员说：“从党员身上闻不出一点‘党味’来”。他还咒骂积极分子都是“吹牛拍马”的人，骂群众是“琉璃球”，抱怨群众没有和他一道进行反党活动。
    反右派斗争开始后，他对自己的反动言行百般抵赖，经群众揭发批判，特别是揭露出他是一个老牌汉奸，历任过伪华北教育总署的高教科长、专员等伪职，暴露出他的卖国求荣的罪恶历史和一贯反共反人民的反动本质后，才被迫开始认罪。
    该社另一右派分子王宗贤，对储安平“党天下”的谬论他表示“全部同意”，并诬蔑不同意储安平谬论的党员，说因为他们“有个人利益，怕以后当不了领导”。他还恶意歪曲了毛主席报告中对反右派斗争的巨大指导意义，竟说：“现在处在千钧一发之际，用这个报告解围”。
    王宗贤还趁该社召集社外人士座谈会的机会，在大会上放火。他提出一个荒谬的论点说：“法制不完备是人民内部矛盾的主要根源”，并诬蔑说：“从中央一级起就违法乱纪，地方偏差就更大。”王宗贤在同志们义正词严的追问下，不得不承认错误，同时又暴露出一些新的反动观点。现该社对王宗贤的斗争正扩大战果中。
