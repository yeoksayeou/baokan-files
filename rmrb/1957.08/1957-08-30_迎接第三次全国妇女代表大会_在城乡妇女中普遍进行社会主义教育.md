　　To Welcome the Third National Women's Congress
　　Conducting Universal Socialist Education Among Urban and Rural Women
　　The All-China Democratic Women's Federation recently issued key points for the publicity of the Third National Women's Congress of China.
　　The publicity key points state that the Third National Women's Congress of China will be held in September 1957. Under the current new domestic situation, women's socialist consciousness has been greatly enhanced. Most women have participated in social labor to varying degrees and have made great contributions to the great cause of socialist transformation and socialist construction. At the same time, the reform of the ownership of the means of production and the establishment of socialist relations of production have fundamentally eliminated the economic basis that oppressed and bound women. Now women have been basically liberated, and men and women are basically equal. China's women's movement has entered a new stage. The task facing our women nationwide is to continue to improve their socialist ideological awareness, under the leadership of the Party, to clarify the major issues of right and wrong concerning the fundamental interests of our people, to smoothly pass the socialist test, to strengthen their confidence and determination to follow the socialist road, to make greater contributions to socialist construction, and to continue to eliminate the remnants of capitalist and feudal ideas of male superiority. This task is also the basic task of this Women's Congress. To this end, we must, in accordance with the spirit and content of the "Instructions on Conducting a Large-Scale Socialist Education for the Entire Rural Population" recently issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, as well as other relevant documents, combined with the publicity work before and after the opening of the Third National Women's Congress, conduct a universal and in-depth socialist propaganda and education among urban and rural women nationwide.
　　1. Women nationwide must further draw a clear line ideologically between the two roads of socialism and capitalism and firmly follow the Communist Party on the socialist road.
　　Primarily, through recollections and comparisons of women's participation in labor production, the improvement of women's lives, and the improvement of women's social and family status, enhance women's understanding of the superiority of the socialist system.
　　In recent years, the number of women participating in industrial and agricultural production has increased rapidly. In 1952, there were 990,000 female workers nationwide, which increased to more than 3 million by the end of 1955. After the high tide of cooperativization, about 100 million women participated in the labor of agricultural cooperatives, five times more than in 1955. Among the more than 700,000 agricultural cooperatives nationwide, 70% to 80% of the cooperatives have female chairpersons and vice-chairpersons. There are also 1.5 million female members in handicraft cooperatives, accounting for 30% of the total number of handicraft cooperative members. With the continuous improvement of the living standards of the people nationwide, the lives of women are also constantly improving. The days of "bran and vegetable for half a year's food" and tattered clothes, which women in the countryside experienced most deeply, are gone, and the need for and purchasing power of daily necessities have increased. The amount of cotton cloth consumed in rural areas in 1956 increased by two times compared to 1950. At the same time, since the founding of the People's Republic of China eight years ago, working women have increasingly participated in state power organs and government management at all levels. With the improvement of their economic, political, and social status, women have basically changed their past subordinate status in the family. Feudal customs such as male superiority, husband's authority, and patriarchal autocracy have basically been transformed, and a new socialist atmosphere of gender equality, democracy, and harmony is becoming increasingly widespread. Women engaged in housework are valued and respected by society.
　　Today, women in all aspects are masters of the country just like men. Women's rights are protected by national laws. This is something that no dynasty in the past could do. Therefore, only under the leadership of the Communist Party and by following the socialist road can we consolidate our happy life. The rightists attempt to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party, overthrow the people's democratic dictatorship, and overthrow the socialist system to restore capitalism and make us go back to the dead end of the old society. This is something that women can never agree to. Our women nationwide should resolutely participate in this struggle against the rightists, constantly improve their socialist awareness, distinguish between major issues of right and wrong, safeguard the socialist system, implement the various policies and regulations of the state, overcome individualism and departmentalism, unite the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual, and resolutely follow the Communist Party on the bright road of socialism.
　　2. Build the country with diligence and thrift, manage the household with diligence and thrift, and make greater contributions to socialism.
　　Building a socialist society is an arduous labor process that must rely on our hard work to create. Therefore, whether women are in any work position or are housewives, they should work hard and practice thrift. All women engaged in productive labor should actively labor, increase production, save raw materials, reduce costs, overcome the mentality of hired labor, abide by labor discipline, and constantly improve their business ability and technical level, improve production and work efficiency, and ensure the successful completion or over-completion of the state and collective production tasks. In recent years, many women production experts and labor models have emerged. They are all role models for working women. However, there are also a few women who, in pursuit of enjoyment, are fond of ease and averse to hard work, violate labor discipline, or proceed from personal self-interest, seeking only quantity and not quality in labor in order to earn more money, wasting state and collective property. This should be educated, criticized, and helped to correct.
　　Managing the household with diligence and thrift is a glorious and particularly important task for housewives in socialist society. Today, our country is a socialist country that implements planned production and planned distribution. Our family life must be adapted to the country's plan. This requires housewives to be good at careful calculations and manage the household with diligence and thrift in the spirit of building the country with diligence and thrift, so that family life can be adapted to the planned production and distribution of the state and the collective. Women in various regions have proven from practice that this is not only possible but also has many benefits. In order to further implement managing the household with diligence and thrift, we must further recognize the close relationship between the state, the collective, and the family, and regard loving the family and loving the country and the collective as consistent interests. We are a country with a population of 600 million. If each person saves one or two liang of grain per day, the country can save 13.5 billion jin of grain throughout the year, which is not far from the figure of 15.4 billion jin of grain increased nationwide in 1956. If each person makes one more set of clothes, using seven and a half chi of cloth, the country will need 45 million bolts of cotton cloth. It can be seen that even a small amount of saving a handful of rice, an inch of cloth, or a fen of money at home can greatly benefit the country. The ideas and behaviors of only considering personal and family interests, disregarding collective and national interests, only considering immediate interests, disregarding long-term interests, unwilling to sell surplus grain to the state, and not saving grain, cotton cloth, and other materials, adopting the method of "live for today and let tomorrow take care of itself," and completely relying on the government to solve future difficulties, are all incorrect. It must be recognized that managing the household with diligence and thrift is an actual action for housewives to implement the policy of building the country with diligence and thrift, and all of this is for socialist construction, that is, for a better and happier future for ourselves and our future generations.
　　3. With the attitude of being masters of the country, give full play to the power of the collective, promote mutual aid and mutual assistance work, carry out mass social service undertakings and women's and children's welfare undertakings, and overcome and reduce the difficulties in the socialist advancement.
　　At present, with the improvement of people's living standards, childcare welfare, cultural, and educational undertakings have not kept up with the needs. Women as masters of the country must shoulder the responsibility of overcoming these difficulties and find ways to solve them together with the government, and must not just wait for the government to solve them. In addition to adopting increased production and thrift, building the country with diligence and thrift, and managing the household with diligence and thrift to overcome these difficulties, we must also rely on our own strength to carry out mass mutual aid and mutual assistance and run various social welfare and service undertakings. In the past few years, urban and rural women have developed various mutual aid service undertakings, such as mutual aid childcare in the vast rural areas, rapidly developing mass childcare stations in the streets, economic mutual aid groups among staff and workers' families, and the development of possible sideline production, self-study tutoring groups for middle and primary school students organized in the streets, and learning stations for school-age children. Recently, some cities are also trying out cooperative service stations to carry out labor mutual aid and help the masses overcome difficulties in housework. These various mutual aid service undertakings are of great benefit to giving play to potential social human resources, helping women overcome difficulties, and strengthening unity among women. In the future, we can vigorously carry out this aspect of work.
　　4. Further establish and improve the communist moral standards of all the people, and correctly treat marriage, family, women, and children.
　　After liberation, especially after the implementation of the Marriage Law campaign and the high tide of socialist transformation, the new atmosphere of gender equality, mutual respect and mutual assistance, unity and friendship, and respecting the old and loving the young has become increasingly widespread in society. In recent years, under the education of the Party, more and more people have been able to handle marriage and family issues in accordance with socialist principles, and thus happy marriages and democratic and harmonious families have grown and developed universally. However, due to the influence of the remnants of old society's ideas on people, it cannot be quickly eliminated in the short term. Therefore, at present, a considerable number of people still have some problems of varying degrees in their views and attitudes towards women and children in marriage and family relationships. It is very important to strengthen education on treating marriage, family, women, and children with communist morality in the future.
　　In marriage relationships: We advocate establishing solid and lasting love and marriage based on ideological consistency, mutual love and mutual assistance, and joint labor for the construction of socialism. We must resolutely oppose those incorrect marriage views that base love and marriage on money and material things, are irresponsible for love, and are fond of the new and tired of the old, and marry and divorce rashly. For young people, we should also advocate not to fall in love and get married too early, so as not to affect their study, work, and health. In a few areas where feudal customs are still relatively serious, we should continue to publicize freedom of marriage and oppose the evils of arranged marriages, child marriages, and trading marriages.
　　In the family aspect: We advocate establishing a new type of socialist family with gender equality, mutual respect and love, joint labor, respecting the old and loving the young, and respecting mothers-in-law and loving daughters-in-law. We must continue to eliminate the remnants of male superiority and female inferiority in husband-wife family relations. We must encourage women to overcome ideas such as inferiority, dependence, or simply pursuing enjoyment. Between parents and children, there should be mutual support, and we must oppose unwillingness to support, or abandonment, abuse, beating, and scolding of parents, parents-in-law, and other thoughts and behaviors that violate communist morality. Actively advocate respecting the old and loving the young, respecting mothers-in-law and loving daughters-in-law, respecting the lifelong labor of the elderly, and arranging a happy old age for the elderly.
　　Regarding women, we must further establish a social atmosphere of gender equality, opposing discrimination and contempt for women, and protecting women's legitimate rights, and adhere to the socialist principle of equal pay for equal work for men and women. For social phenomena that violate the policy of gender equality, we should constantly conduct education and criticism.
　　Regarding children: Society, schools, and families should all be responsible for cultivating children into successors to socialist and communist construction with noble communist morality. Advocate that adults set an example and use practical actions to educate children on the glory of labor and love for labor. Schools and families should cultivate children's qualities of diligence, honesty, friendship, and courage from an early age. For the phenomenon of a few hooligan bad elements harming children in society, we must call on all sectors of society to take effective measures to stop them. The phenomenon of families, especially parents, abandoning their responsibility for their children's education, or not educating their children in proper ways, should be corrected, and the act of abusing children should be resolutely opposed.
　　The National Women's Federation requires that this publicity work should be in-depth and widespread, first of all, it should be in-depth among the masses of workers and peasants, and it should also be extended to the families of industrialists and businessmen, and women from other strata. Publicity should also be carried out in ethnic minority areas. And it is necessary to overcome the situation in the past where publicity work mostly stayed at the level of grassroots cadres and activists.

　　迎接第三次全国妇女代表大会
　　在城乡妇女中普遍进行社会主义教育
    新华社29日讯　中华全国民主妇女联合会最近发出关于中国第三次全国妇女代表大会的宣传要点。
    宣传要点中说，中国第三次全国妇女代表大会将于1957年9月召开。在当前国内新的形势下，妇女的社会主义觉悟已有了极大的提高，大多数妇女在不同程度上已经参加了社会劳动，并在伟大的社会主义改造和社会主义建设事业中，作出了巨大贡献，同时，生产资料所有制的改革和社会主义生产关系的建立，已从根本上解除了压迫和束缚妇女的经济基础。现在妇女已基本解放，男女已基本平等。我国妇女运动已进入到了一个新的阶段。摆在我们全国妇女面前的任务是继续提高社会主义思想觉悟，在党的领导下，弄清关于我国人民根本利益的大是大非，顺利的过社会主义这一关，坚定走社会主义道路的信心和决心，为社会主义建设作出更大的贡献，并为继续清除资本主义、封建主义重男轻女的思想残余而奋斗。这个任务也就是这次妇女代表大会的基本任务。为此，我们必须根据中共中央最近发出的
  “关于向全体农村人口进行一次大规模的社会主义教育的指示”的精神和内容以及其他有关文件，结合第三次妇代大会召开前后的宣传工作，向全国城乡妇女进行一次普遍深入的社会主义宣传教育。
    一、全国妇女要进一步从思想上划清社会主义和资本主义两条道路的界限，坚定地跟着共产党走社会主义的道路。
    主要从妇女参加劳动生产情况、妇女生活提高的情况以及妇女的社会地位和家庭地位提高的情况等方面的回忆对比中，来提高妇女对社会主义制度优越性的认识。
    几年来，妇女参加工农业生产的人数迅速增长。1952年全国女职工有九十九万，到1955年底即增加到三百多万。合作化高潮后，有一亿左右妇女参加了农业社的劳动，比1955年增加了五倍，全国七十多万个农业社中70％到80％的社已有了女社长和女副社长。手工业合作社的女社员也已经有一百五十万，占全体手工业社员总数的30％。随着全国人民生活水平的不断提高，妇女的生活也不断提高。农民中妇女体会最深的“糠菜半年粮”和破衣烂衫的日子已经过去了，日用品的需要和购买力增加了。农村消费棉布量，1956年就比1950年增加了两倍。同时新中国成立八年来，劳动妇女已日益众多地参加了各级的国家权力机关和政权管理工作。随着经济、政治、社会地位的提高，妇女在家庭中已基本上改变了过去的从属地位，重男轻女、夫权统治和家长专权等封建习俗，基本上已有了转变，男女平等、民主和睦的社会主义新风气日益普遍地树立起来。从事家务劳动的妇女，受到了社会的重视和尊敬。
    今天妇女在各方面都和男子一样是祖国的主人。妇女的权利受到国家法律的保障。这是过去任何一个朝代所做不到的。所以只有在共产党领导下，走社会主义道路，才能巩固我们的幸福生活。右派分子企图推翻共产党的领导，推翻人民民主专政，推翻社会主义制度，使资本主义复辟，使我们走回旧社会的死路上去，这是妇女决不能答应的。我们全国妇女应该坚决地投入这次反右派的斗争中，不断提高社会主义觉悟，明辨大是大非，维护社会主义制度，执行国家的各项政策规定，克服个人主义和本位主义思想，把国家、集体和个人利益一致起来，坚决跟着共产党走社会主义的光明大道。
    二、勤俭建国、勤俭持家，为社会主义作出更大的贡献。
    建设社会主义社会，是一个艰苦的劳动过程，必须依靠我们辛勤的劳动去创造。所以不论在任何工作岗位上的妇女或家庭妇女，都应当辛勤劳动，厉行节约。一切从事生产劳动的妇女，都应当积极劳动，增加生产，节约原材料，降低成本，克服雇佣观点，遵守劳动纪律，并不断提高自己业务能力和技术水平，提高生产和工作效率，保证国家、集体的生产任务完满完成或超额完成。几年来，已经出现了不少妇女生产能手、劳动模范，她们都是劳动妇女的榜样。但也有少数妇女，为追求享受，好逸恶劳，破坏劳动纪律或从个人私利出发，为多挣钱，在劳动中只求数量不求质量，浪费国家和集体的资财，这是应当加以教育批判，并帮助改正的。
    勤俭持家是社会主义社会的家庭妇女一项光荣的和特别重要的任务。今天我们的国家是社会主义国家，是实行计划生产和计划分配的，我们的家庭生活必须和国家的计划相适应，这就要靠家庭妇女本着勤俭建国的方针的精神，善于精打细算，勤俭持家，使家庭生活能与国家、集体的计划生产与分配相适应。各地妇女从实践中已经证明，这样做不但可能，而且好处很多。为了进一步贯彻勤俭持家，我们一定要进一步认识国家、集体和家庭的密切关系，把爱家和爱国、爱集体看成是利益一致的事。我们是个六亿人口的国家，每人每日节约一两粮，全年全国就能节约一百三十五亿斤粮食，比1956年全国增产粮食一百五十四亿斤的数字已相差不远。假若每人多做一身衣，用布七尺半，全国就需要棉布四千五百万匹。可见家庭间一把米、一寸布、一分钱的点滴节约对国家都有很大好处。那种只顾个人、家庭利益，不顾集体、国家利益，只顾眼前利益，不顾长远利益，不愿卖余粮给国家，不节约粮食、棉布等物资，采取“今朝有酒今朝醉”的办法，把日后困难问题完全依赖政府解决等的思想和行为，都是不正确的。必须认识勤俭持家，就是家庭妇女执行勤俭建国方针的一种实际的行动，而这一切又都是为了社会主义建设，也就是为了我们自己和子孙后代更美好幸福的未来。
    三、以主人翁的态度，发挥集体的力量，推广互助互济工作，开展群众性的社会服务事业和妇女儿童福利事业，克服和减少社会主义前进中的困难。
    目前随着人民生活水平的提高，托儿福利，文化教育事业已赶不上需要。作为国家主人翁的妇女们，要把克服这些困难的责任，承担起来，和政府一道千方百计来设法解决，决不能只等着政府来解决。我们除了采用增产节约、勤俭建国、勤俭持家来克服这些困难外，还要依靠自己的力量，开展群众性的互助互济、举办各种社会福利和服务性的事业。在过去几年中，城乡妇女发展了各种互助服务事业，例如广大农村开展互助托儿，街道中迅速发展的群众性的托儿站，职工家属中的经济互助组及发展可能的副业生产，街道上组织的中、小学生的自学辅导组，及学龄儿童学习站，最近有的城市并在试办合作服务站，进行劳力互助，帮助群众克服家务劳动方面的困难。这种种互助服务事业，对发挥社会潜在的人力资源、帮助妇女克服困难、加强妇女之间的团结都有很大的好处，今后还可以大力开展这方面的工作。
    四、进一步树立和提高全体人民的共产主义道德水平，正确对待婚姻、家庭、妇女、儿童。
    解放后，尤其是贯彻婚姻法运动及社会主义改造高潮后，社会上男女平等、互敬互助、团结友爱、尊老爱幼的新风气，日益普遍的上升。几年来，在党的教育下，已有越来越多的人能按着社会主义的原则，处理婚姻家庭问题，因而美满婚姻，民主和睦家庭普遍的成长发展。但是由于旧社会思想残余对人们的影响，不是短期内可以迅速清除的，因此，目前还有相当一部分人在婚姻家庭关系上，对待妇女、儿童的观点和态度上，程度不同的存在一些问题。今后加强以共产主义道德对待婚姻、家庭、妇女、儿童的教育是很重要的。
    在婚姻关系上：我们提倡建立思想一致、互爱互助、为建设社会主义而共同劳动的巩固持久的爱情和婚姻。对于那些把爱情、婚姻建立在金钱物质上，对爱情不负责任，喜新厌旧、轻率结婚离婚等不正确的婚姻观点要坚决反对。对于青年，还应当提倡不要过早恋爱、结婚，以免影响学习工作和身体健康。在封建习俗还比较严重的少数地区，应该继续宣传婚姻自由，反对包办买卖、早婚等恶习。
    在家庭方面：我们提倡建立男女平等、互敬互爱、共同劳动、尊老爱幼、尊婆爱媳的社会主义新型家庭，要继续清除夫妻家庭关系中的男尊女卑的残余思想。要鼓励妇女克服自卑、依赖或单纯追求享受等思想。在父母子女之间，应该相互扶养，反对不愿赡养，或者遗弃、虐待、打骂父母、公婆等违背共产主义道德的思想和行为。积极提倡尊老爱幼、尊婆爱媳，尊重老年人毕生的劳动，为老年人安排幸福的晚年。
    对待妇女方面，还要在社会上进一步树立男女平等、反对歧视轻视妇女并保护妇女合法权利的风气，坚持贯彻男女同工同酬的社会主义原则，对于社会上违反男女平等政策的现象，应当不断的进行教育和批判。
    对待儿童方面：社会、学校、家庭都应当负责把儿童培养成为具有高尚的共产主义道德的社会主义、共产主义建设的接班人。提倡成人以身作则用实际行动向儿童进行劳动光荣热爱劳动的教育。学校、家庭都应当从小培养儿童勤劳、诚实、友爱、勇敢的品德，对于社会上少数流氓坏分子残害儿童的现象，必须呼吁社会各方面作有效的措施予以制止。家庭间尤其是父母放弃对子女教育的责任，或不以正当方法教育子女的现象应当纠正，虐待儿童的行为更应当坚决反对。
    全国妇联要求这次宣传工作力求深入广泛，首先要深入到工农妇女群众中，还应当扩大到工商业者家属，及其他各阶层妇女中去。在少数民族地区，也应当展开宣传。并要克服过去宣传工作多停留在基层干部和积极分子一层的情况。
