Growing Up in Struggle
——Reminiscences of Struggles in the Shaanxi-Gansu Red Second Regiment
Lieutenant General Cui Tianmin, Political Commissar of the Railway Corps

    After the failure of the Great Revolution in 1927, the peasant movement in northern Shaanxi, which had just begun to develop, was also subjected to the bloody suppression of the reactionaries. Farmers' associations and self-defense forces in various places were disbanded.

    In 1928 and 1929, northern Shaanxi suffered from continuous droughts, with thousands of miles of barren land and no harvest. The masses lived on tree bark and grass roots. A dou of rice cost ten thousand coins. The people had no means to live. However, the exorbitant taxes and levies of the Kuomintang and the warlord of northern Shaanxi, Jing Yuexiu, were not reduced, but were "contracted" to the gentry and local bullies, who then added another layer of exploitation, making the peasants even more miserable. Around the autumn and winter of 1928, under the call of the Party to resist grain, taxes, and levies, peasants from Suide and Qingjian, sometimes hundreds, sometimes thousands, went to the cities to petition. However, due to poor organization and the weakness of the Party, they were deceived back by the cunning pseudo-county magistrate with empty words. This struggle failed. Not only did they not receive any benefits, but they also suffered from cold and hunger, spent their travel expenses, and gained nothing. But they learned one lesson: "Peasant struggles should not go to the cities."

    Autumn disasters are easy to endure, but spring famine is difficult to overcome. The spring famine of 1929 was very serious. At this time when the crops were not yet ripe, the masses were starving. We learned from the failure of the grain resistance struggle in 1928 and adopted the method of organizing ourselves and taking action. We went to villages with "charity granaries" and borrowed from those who had more grain. In this way, the charity granaries were opened, and grain was distributed. This method was immediately welcomed by the masses, and the number of people increased, and the momentum grew. Cui Yuliu, who was in charge of the granary, was so frightened that he died, and many gentry and local bullies in charge of the granaries were scared away. Xue Yuntong, the district chief of Xuejiamao, was so frightened that he ran to the mountains to jump off a cliff... This struggle not only helped the masses survive the spring famine, but also exposed the deceptive tricks of the warlord bureaucrats, landlords, and gentry, expanded the influence of the Communist Party, and established a further connection between the Party and the masses. This struggle was a great victory both politically and economically.

    In order to further consolidate the masses' fighting spirit, by 1931, we had restored and expanded the Party organizations in the northern district of Suide, the Dian district of Qingjian, the eastern district, the urban district, and other places. We adopted the forms of chalk teams and rural peddlers, using revolutionary songs, Yangko dances, dramas, and couplets to go to the countryside, publicizing that the Red Army and the workers' and peasants' government were the army and government of the workers and peasants themselves. The consciousness of the working people gradually increased. Having revolutionary demands, they criticized us, saying: "You only talk, but it's useless! To do something, you need guns. Paper flags can't accomplish great things!"

    Just at this time—in the spring of 1932, Gao Langting suddenly raised the red flag of the "Shaanxi-Gansu Guerrilla Ninth Detachment of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army" between Suide and Qingjian. We were greatly surprised and immediately sent more than ten Party members, including Zhang Chengzhong and Cui Zhengran, members of the Suide Southern District Committee, to pursue them. After more than a month of running around, they finally found them. From then on, this team became an armed force led by the Party.

    Starting with Three Guns

    May of the same year.

    We were preparing to attend an enlarged meeting of the Northern Shaanxi Special Committee to discuss launching armed struggle. One day, a porcelain peddler from the eastern district of Qingjian, carrying a load of porcelain, came to Tiejiaping Village in the southern district of Suide to find me. This person was dressed as a rural peddler, but his words and deeds had a student-like air. Seeing me, he put down his load and hurriedly took out a letter from his pocket. As expected, this porcelain peddler, named Wang Jude, was a student of the Fourth Normal School of Shaanxi Province. While selling opium in Shanxi, he bought a batch of weapons with Bai Xilin and returned to northern Shaanxi, intending to disarm the militia of Huayan Temple in Qingjian. However, due to the lack of Party leadership, he failed. Only three guns remained. Wang Jude understood this principle and decided to find the Communist Party. He first found Comrade Bai Shuxun (i.e., Bai Rubing), who wrote him a letter of introduction to find us.

    "I have three guns that have fallen into the hands of the Gelaohui," he said. "I can go and lure them here, wanting to get the guns into our hands, hoping to do things under the leadership of the Party..."

    At that time, Comrade Cui Zhengran had already been transferred back from Gao Langting's detachment to serve as the district committee. After discussion, it was decided that he would be responsible for seizing the guns. Cui Zhengran opened a small shop in the village, selling "dry ovens" and "roast chicken" as cover, which had always been the place where we held meetings and made contact. Although we were all very poor, we still scraped together some travel expenses for Wang Jude. Wang Jude's shoes were also so broken that his toes were exposed. I gave him my only pair of cloth shoes to wear. Soon, Wang Jude and Cui Zhengran seized these three guns and also won over a Shandong person who was very skilled with guns and relatively honest.

    At the same time, Cui Tianfu, Gao Langting, and I hurried to a rural village near Wulongpu in Jia County to attend an enlarged meeting of the Northern Shaanxi Special Committee. The meeting was held in Gao Luxiao's cave dwelling. More than thirty comrades attended. There was no light in the cave. We lit bean oil lamps day and night. We held meetings, rested, ate, slept, and relieved ourselves all here. Although it was summer, we were still cold wearing sheepskin coats in the cave. We held meetings for about a week, and we didn't even know what the village outside looked like. The meeting criticized the idea of passively waiting and decided to boldly mobilize the masses, launch guerrilla warfare, and create guerrilla areas and base areas. It was also decided to first establish a detachment in Anding, a second detachment in Suide and Qingjian, and a third detachment in Shenfu. The meeting also re-elected the leadership of the Special Committee, and newly absorbed comrades such as Zhang Dazhi, Gao Changjiu, and Cui Tianfu to participate in the Special Committee.

    However, as soon as the enlarged meeting of the Special Committee closed, while we were dispersing in different directions, due to a traitor's betrayal, Special Committee members Bi Hongbo (Weizhou), Gao Luxiao, and three other comrades were arrested. Comrades Ma Mingfang and Ma Wenrui ran out from the enemy's hail of bullets in broad daylight. The five arrested comrades were escorted to Suide and shot. They were all very brave comrades. At the time of execution, Comrade Bi Weizhou shouted slogans all the way. The enemy cut off his right arm, but he immediately raised his left arm and shouted: "Down with the warlords!" "Long live the Communist Party of China!"...

    This unfortunate incident, although it brought great losses and difficulties to the leadership of the Special Committee at the time, the comrades who attended the meeting in various counties had already taken the spirit of the meeting back, which did not greatly affect the task of launching guerrilla warfare and creating guerrilla areas, and they quickly took action.

    Our group left Jia County and rushed to Liujiawan in Suide overnight, intending to return to our small pharmacy (county committee office). But as soon as we arrived at the street entrance, a Party member stopped us and said: "Go quickly! The pharmacy has been sealed off, and they are arresting you!"

    We went directly to the southern district, arranged work for the district committee, and according to the decision of the enlarged meeting of the Special Committee, formed the Second Detachment with the three Mauser pistols obtained by Wang Jude and Cui Zhengran, and they were responsible for it.

    From then on, in the border area between Suide and Qingjian, this armed force consisting of only three guns actively engaged. First, they targeted the "grain contractors" and usurious landlords who aroused the greatest public outrage. In July, they killed Gao Zhengdong, the grain contractor, and the lackey bailiffs who collected the money; in August and September, they killed Xue Yuntong, the district chief of Xuejiamao, the usurer Cui Huacheng, and the gentry Bai ××. In this way, the guerrilla war in the Suide-Qingjian area was launched, and the Second Detachment was born in this vigorous mass struggle! And with the development of the mass struggle, it rapidly grew, and by 1934, it had expanded into the Second Regiment of the Eighty-Fourth Division of the Twenty-Seventh Army of the Red Army.

    Laba Festival Gathering

    Jiejiagou in Qingjian County is a larger town not far from the Yellow River.

    On the eighth day of the twelfth lunar month in 1933, the last market of the year—the Laba Festival Gathering—arrived. Because of the economic relations of the year, good or bad, had to be settled at this time, there were particularly many people attending the gathering. Landlords, local bullies, usurers, and yamen runners also took this opportunity to urge grain and force debts; many small vendors from Shanxi across the Yellow River also transported various local products, "New Year's goods," and foreign goods to attend the gathering. Therefore, our Party organization and guerrillas used this excellent mass occasion to distribute a large number of leaflets, exposing the crimes of local tyrants and evil gentry, publicizing that the Red Army and the workers' and peasants' government were the armed forces and political power of the workers and peasants themselves, and calling on the people to organize and arm themselves, overthrow local tyrants and evil gentry, overthrow the feudal system...

    The First Detachment of Anding failed in its military adventure and the assault on a fortified position, burying the remaining ten or so guns. After receiving the report, we immediately sent Zhang Aimin to lead more than ten comrades to form a Jianghu troupe (similar to the current Quyi troupe), disguised as storytellers to rush to Anding, take out the buried guns, and rush back to Qingjian overnight. The day before the Laba Festival Gathering, I disguised myself as a New Year picture seller and rushed to this place with them, staying in Wangjiashan, about ten miles away from Jiejiagou. The Second Detachment was also transferred to discuss the issue of returning the armed forces of the First Detachment to Anding to operate.

    Wangjiashan. It was the first village in Qingjian to be "publicly" supportive of the revolution. (Public means that everyone in the village agreed with the revolution, and we could operate openly.) Therefore, we planned to rest well during the day and transfer to Anding across the Wuding River at night. As the comrades were happily wiping their weapons, a team member accidentally fired his submachine gun with a "bang!" The captain criticized him: "Luckily, it was in a publicly supportive village, otherwise, you would have exposed our target."

    Another team member picked up the conversation and joked: "Captain, the gun went off because it wanted to eat people. This is a sign of fighting!"

    Before long, the enemy was discovered. Dozens of militiamen passed by on a small road next to the village. The team members wanted to open fire, but the captain stopped them. The team member who liked to joke sighed: "Hey! We can't fight again!"

    The sun slowly set over the mountain slope, and the people attending the gathering were already beginning to return. At this time, Bai Yuhua, a new Party member from Jiejiagou, ran over breathlessly and said: "Today's leaflets have caused a sensation among the people attending the gathering. Everyone says they are good, but the villagers also say: 'You only talk but don't do anything. There are so many evil local tyrants in the town today, why don't you kill them!? Why don't you take care of the lackeys who force grain and taxes!?'"

    Bai Yuhua's words ignited the fire in everyone's hearts. In fact, the "Laba Festival Gathering" brought together bullies from all directions, whom you couldn't even get together if you were hosting a banquet. Detachment leader Bai Xueshan looked at me, meaning: "What do you think we should do?" I said: "Let's all discuss it."

    As soon as I finished speaking, the team members scrambled to speak, and everyone unanimously agreed: This is "business" that has been delivered to our door, and we must do it. So, it was decided to prepare immediately, waiting for dusk to arrive.

    The sun set in the west, and the sky gradually darkened. By the time the lights were lit, the people attending the market had already dispersed. We divided into three groups and went down the mountain, surrounding all the courtyards where the local tyrants lived. That night, the wind was particularly strong, blowing snowflakes all over the ground, which stung our faces, but our young hearts were very hot. Not one of the local tyrants, evil gentry, or lackeys was missed. They were all caught. We warned those whose crimes were relatively minor. As for the evil bullies whom the peasants hated to the bone, we were not polite. We dragged them to the river beach and killed nine and a half—one was smashed half to death with a stone. When the people in the town saw that we not only said "Down with the local tyrants" but actually did it, they felt very happy and said: "Good riddance, killing these bad guys will give us poor people a breather..."

    The news that the "Laba Festival Gathering" had captured and killed a group of landlords and gentry greatly shocked the towns and cities far and wide, expanded the influence of the Communist Party and the Red Army, and raised the consciousness of the masses. This news, along with the small vendors from Shanxi who came to attend the gathering, spread like wildfire across the Yellow River, and the people of Shanxi also said: "Now the savior has arrived. There are many Red Army in northern Shaanxi, and they are very powerful! This team is really doing things for the poor..."

    Big Trouble in Xiaochazi Village

    In the spring and summer of 1934, I followed the Second Detachment to inspect work in the urban area of Qingjian County, staying in Xiaochazi Village, about ten miles from the county seat. Here, we held a district committee meeting to discuss how to carry out work in the urban area and "publicize" the villages in the urban area.

    Xiaochazi was not really small, with more than a hundred households, which was considered a large village in northern Shaanxi. The Party's work in this village had a good foundation. Even during the Great Revolution, this village had been very active. The masses were deeply influenced by the revolution. In 1934, it was almost a publicly supportive village. Therefore, as soon as we settled down, the village's "wireless telephone" [Note 1] was set up. As soon as the White Army in the city moved, we would know immediately. Everyone was very relieved, and no sentries were even posted.

    In this village, in addition to farming and agricultural production, sideline production was also very common. Whether it was grinding flour to feed pigs or making noodles, almost every household had a sideline. When the guerrillas came, the villagers welcomed them extremely and invited them to eat noodles in their homes. We were busy holding meetings and didn't have time to visit each household. Who knew that while we were holding a meeting, Dong, the White Army company commander, led a company of men from the river port on the Yellow River to Qingjian City to change defenses. We didn't expect the White Army to come from the Yellow River, and the enemy didn't know we were here. As the enemy entered the village, an old woman ran in in a panic: "Hurry! Go to the mountains, the White Army has entered the village!"

    As soon as the old woman finished speaking, gunfire rang out. Our guerrillas ran out of the cave dwellings with guns in all directions and started fighting with the White Army, fighting and seizing the mountain peaks. As I was packing up the documents and about to go out, bullets whizzed towards the courtyard, blocking the way out. At this time, thanks to a team member who had been won over from the White Army, he had combat experience and was very skilled with guns. Under his cover fire, we also rushed out and retreated to the mountains.

    After going up the mountain, the enemy couldn't figure out our details and didn't dare to advance rashly, so the two sides confronted each other on the mountain peaks for a day.

    At dusk, the White Army retreated to Qingjian City, and we also moved to a nearby mountain village to camp. In the evening, everyone gathered to discuss how to deal with the enemy, how to protect Xiaochazi Village from enemy destruction, and how to carry out the work of "publicizing" villages in the urban area. At this time, a team member who usually didn't like to talk, nicknamed "Stupid," came up with a clever plan. He said: "Tomorrow, the White Army will definitely come to Xiaochazi. Let's disguise ourselves as ordinary people and ambush in the village. If they don't come, then fine. If they come, we'll catch them off guard." We thought this method was very good, so we agreed with his opinion and arranged the work.

    The next day, the White Army really came. First, the militia regiment leader ran into the village with several militiamen to "enlist" [Note 2]. As soon as they entered the village, "Stupid" began to beat the gong and shouted at the top of his voice: "Villagers, the regiment leader wants to give a speech. Come out and listen quickly. The regiment leader said: Those who hide the Red Army without reporting will have their whole family killed. Those who hand them over will be forgiven!..."

    "Stupid"'s shout brought out the ambushed team members. Most of the guerrillas were farmers, and when they disguised themselves, they looked even more like peasants. Everyone pretended to be honest and came to listen to the speech, and suddenly surrounded the militia. First, they killed the militia regiment leader, and then they confiscated the militiamen's guns. When the White Army outside the village heard the gunshots, they knew the situation was not good and dared not rashly enter the village. We also immediately pulled the team to the mountains.

    The situation was very tense. After annihilating the militia that entered the village, the White Army conducted fire reconnaissance on us from Dachazi Village, three miles away. The people dared not stay in the village, fearing that the White Army would enter the village to burn and kill. They all helped the old and young, rolled up their bedding, and pulled their livestock, and followed us up the mountain. This was a lively scene. The children cried, the women shouted, and everyone stared at the guerrillas. I was extremely anxious in my heart. What should I do? I called the guerrillas to cover the entire village of old and young, hundreds of people, and transferred them to a more hidden mountain depression. After arranging the team, I gathered the villagers together for a meeting. First, I explained to the villagers: "Villagers, now the problem has become big. Now, there are only two roads in front of us: One is to return to the village and surrender to the White Army, allowing the enemy to slaughter us; the other is for the entire village of old and young to organize and make revolution! Do a good job of 'wireless telephone,' establish a Red Guard. Leave a small number of young and strong Red Guards to rectify those enemy spies and hooligans and protect the village. When the enemy comes, we will transfer. The rest of the men, women, old and young will go to visit relatives. Everyone is responsible for publicizing to their relatives and friends, so that every family will be on the side of the Red Army. Let's make all the surrounding villages red. When we have more people, we will have more strength, and the White Army will have no way..."

    Many people on the hillside showed joy, but some were still hesitant. Just as we were about to explain the principles more clearly, an old man suddenly stood up and said angrily: "What is there to hesitate about? The White Army just doesn't want us to live. Returning to the village to surrender is just waiting to die. Only organizing and making revolution is a way out..."

    "That's right! Let's make revolution! Let's all go to visit relatives!"

    "Let's make revolution to the end, make northern Shaanxi red, and fight with the Red Army and Gao Guizi!..."

    "............"

    The villagers were enraged. People who were originally timid, seeing many flying fists and spears, also decided to follow the guerrillas. At this time, a man in his thirties (a Party member), who seemed to have rich social experience, was afraid that the people would not be united and the news would leak out, so he took the opportunity to stand up and said: "If we want to do it, we can only have one mind. No one is allowed to change their mind halfway, and no one is allowed to betray their own people!..."

    "Needless to say, we will never compromise with the enemy!"

    "Whoever betrays will have their head cut off!"

    The masses' fighting spirit was really rising step by step. The entire village, men, women, old and young, four or five hundred people, took their families and dependents overnight, drove their livestock, and took small paths to their relatives' homes. The district committee also immediately notified the Party organizations in various villages to secretly guard the local tyrants and evil gentry, to treat the masses from Xiaochazi Village well, and to step up the work of "publicizing" the villages, organizing poor peasant associations and Red Guards. The Qingjian area had always been an area where guerrillas frequently operated, and the masses were highly aware. After such a commotion in Xiaochazi Village, the nearby villages quickly turned red.

    With the development of the guerrilla war, the guerrilla areas rapidly expanded. In the guerrilla areas of Anding, Suide, Qingjian, Shenmu, Fugu, Jia, and Wubao counties, township, district, and county Soviets were established. At the end of the year, the Shaanxi-Gansu Provincial Workers' and Peasants' Government was established. Mass organizations such as poor peasant leagues, Red Guards, and Young Pioneers were also universally and openly established. In this year, the First Detachment of Anding, the Second Detachment of Suide and Qingjian, the Third Detachment of Shenmu and Fugu, and the Fourth Detachment of Jia County and Wubao were reorganized into the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Regiments of the Red Army. When the Provincial Workers' and Peasants' Government was established in December, the Eighty-Fourth Division of the Twenty-Seventh Army of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army was established (later changed to the Eighty-First Division), and eighteen guerrilla detachments were established. From then on, the Party in the guerrilla areas changed from being secret and illegal to being open and legal.

    By 1935, this was a year of great development for the revolution in northern Shaanxi. After the guerrillas in northern Shaanxi were reorganized into the Eighty-Fourth Division of the Twenty-Seventh Army of the Red Army at the end of 1934, under the leadership of Comrade Liu Zhidan, they first annihilated a company of Gao Guizi's troops in Nanggoucha. Then, in cooperation with the main force of the Twenty-Sixth Army of the Red Army, they annihilated the enemy in the towns of Hekou, Gaojiecun, Dingxianying, Zhangjiayitai in Qingjian County, Mujiachua in Jia County, and Yangjiayuanzi in Anding County, by whole battalions, regiments, and brigades. Before the Twenty-Fifth Army of the Red Army entered Shaanxi, they occupied counties such as Yanchang, Yanchuan, Anding, Baoan, and Anzhai. (The Twenty-Fifth Army of the Red Army joined forces with the Twenty-Sixth and Twenty-Seventh Armies in Yongping on September 18, 1935.) They shattered the offensives and encirclements and suppressions of the warlords Gao Guizi, Guan Linzheng, Sun Chu, and Li Shengda against the Shaanxi-Gansu Soviet Area. Gao Guizi, who had not been hit because the main force of the guerrillas in northern Shaanxi went south to the Shaanxi-Gansu Soviet Area to join forces with the Twenty-Sixth Army of the Red Army, also panicked. He had originally sent an eight-character telegram to Chiang Kai-shek at this time, saying: "Not a single bullet fired, the red bandits have been pacified." He was simply extremely arrogant, his tail held high. Now, he had no choice but to panic and send a telegram to Chiang Kai-shek for help and to report the bad news. The original text of his telegram was: "Defense is extensive and troops are scarce, defense is impossible to prevent. If troops are not increased, northern Shaanxi will become the second Jiangxi!"

    [Note 1] Wireless telephone: A sentry was placed on each mountain peak, and we would receive news as soon as the enemy moved.

    [Note 2] Enlist: That is, the enemy came to recruit and surrender.

    斗争中成长
    ——回忆陕北红二团斗争片断
    铁道兵政治委员　中将　崔田民
    1927年大革命失败后，陕北刚刚发展起来的农民运动，同样遭到了反动派的血腥镇压，各地农民协会、自卫队都被解散了。
    1928、29年，陕北连年旱灾，赤地千里，颗粒未收，群众以树皮草根度口，真是斗米万钱，民不聊生。但是，国民党和陕北军阀井岳秀的苛捐杂税，不但没有减免，反而“包给”士绅土棍，这班家伙又加重一层收刮，农民更是苦不堪言。1928年秋冬前后，绥德、清涧各地农民，在党的抗粮抗税抗捐的号召下，有的数百人，有的千余人，纷纷进城请愿，但是因为组织不好，党的力量又过于薄弱，结果，被狡猾的伪县长一顿花言巧语，骗将回来。这次的斗争失败了，不但未得到任何好处，而且受了冻，挨了饿，贴了盘缠，毫无收获。但是得出一条经验：“农民斗争，不要进城。”
    秋灾易熬，春荒难度。1929年春荒十分严重，在这青黄不接之时，群众嗷嗷待哺。我们接受了28年抗粮斗争的失败教训，采取了组织起来，自己动手的办法。哪村有“义仓”就到哪村去，谁家的粮多就向谁家借。就这样，义仓打开了，粮食分到了，这个办法立刻受到广大群众的欢迎，人数越来越多，人多势也大了。把管仓的崔余六吓得病死了，把许多管仓的士绅土棍吓跑了，薛家峁的区长薛运统吓的跑到山上要跳崖……。这次的斗争，不仅帮助群众度过了春荒，同时揭露了军阀官僚、地主士绅的欺骗伎俩，扩大了共产党的影响，使党与群众之间，建立了进一步的联系。使这次斗争无论是在政治上或经济上，都是一个极大的胜利。
    为了使群众的斗争情绪进一步地巩固下去，到1931年，我们恢复和扩大了绥德北区、清涧店区、东区、城区等地党的组织，采取了粉笔队、农村小贩的形式，用革命歌曲、秧歌、话剧和对联下乡，宣传红军和工农政府是工人农民自己的军队和政府。劳动群众的觉悟逐步地提高了，有了革命的要求，就批评我们说：“你们光说不顶事呀！要干要有枪，纸旗旗干不了大事！”
    正在这时——1932年春天，高朗亭在绥德清涧之间，忽然打起了“中国工农红军陕北游击第九支队”的红旗。我们大吃一惊，连忙派绥德南区区委委员张承忠、崔正冉等十多个党员去追，经过了一个多月的奔波，才找到了他们。从此，这支队伍才成了党领导的一支武装。
    三支枪起家
    同年5月。
    我们正准备去参加讨论开展武装斗争的陕北特委扩大会议。有一天，清涧东区一个磁贩，担着担磁器到绥德南区铁笳坪村来找我。这个人浑身上下一副农村小贩装束，但言谈举止，却带有一股学生味道。见到我，只见他把担子一搁，忙从怀里掏出一封信。果然不出所料，这个磁贩，名叫王巨德，是陕西省立第四师范学校的学生，在山西贩大烟时，同白锡林买了一批武器回到陕北，想缴清涧花岩寺民团的武装，但因没有党的领导，失败了。只剩下三支枪。王巨德明白了这个道理就决心找共产党，首先找到了白树勋（即白如冰）同志，写了个介绍信来找我们。
    “我有三支枪落到哥老会的手里了。”他说，“我能去把他们逗来，想把枪掌握到我们手里，希望在党的领导下搞事情……。”
    当时，崔正冉同志已经由高朗亭支队调回担任区委。研究后，就确定由他负责缴枪。崔正冉在村里开了个小铺，卖些“干炉”“烧鸡”之类作掩护，一向是我们开会联络的地点。虽然我们都很穷，但仍给王巨德凑了些盘缠。王巨德的鞋子也破得不像样，脚指头都露在外面了，我将我唯一的一双布鞋给他穿了。不久，王巨德和崔正冉便把这三支枪缴到手，还争取了一个枪法很好、比较老实的山东人。
    与此同时，我和崔田夫、高朗亭等，赶到了葭县乌龙堡附近的一个农村里参加陕北特委的扩大会议。会议是在高禄孝家的套窑里开的，到会的有三十多个同志。窑洞里没有一点光线，不分昼夜地点着豆油灯，我们开会、休息、吃饭、睡觉、大小便都在这里。虽然是夏天，我们在窑里披着羊皮袄还冷。开了约一个星期的会，还不知道外面的村子是个什么样儿。会议批判了消极等待思想，决定放手发动群众，开展游击战争，创造游击区和根据地；并且决定先在安定建立一支队、绥德清涧建立二支队、神府建立三支队。会议还改选了特委领导机构，新吸收了张达志、高长久、崔田夫等同志参加了特委。
    可是，特委扩大会议刚闭会，我们正分途疏散的期间，由于叛徒告密，特委委员毕洪波（维舟）、高禄孝等五个同志被捕了，马明方、马文瑞等同志大白天从敌人枪林弹雨里跑了出来。被捕的五个同志押到绥德枪杀了，他们，都是很勇敢的同志。临刑时，毕维舟同志沿途高呼口号，敌人砍去了他的右臂，然而，他立刻举起左臂来，高呼着：“打倒军阀！”“中国共产党万岁！”……
    这一不幸事件，虽然当时给特委领导带来了很大的损失和困难，但是各县开会的同志已将会议的精神带回去了，对开展游击战争，创造游击区的任务影响不大，而且很快的行动起来了。
    我们这一路出了葭县，星夜赶到了绥德的刘家湾，打算回到我们开的一个小药铺（县委机关）去。那知道我们刚到街口，就有个党员拦住了我们，说：“快走，药铺给封啦，正在抓你们呢！”
    我们就直接跑到南区，向区委布置了工作，并根据特委扩大会的决定，把王巨德、崔正冉搞到的三支盒子枪组成了第二支队，并由他俩负责。
    从此，在绥德清涧的交界地区，这仅有三支枪组成的武装，积极地活动起来了。首先向民愤最大的“包粮的”高利贷地主们开刀。7月，杀了包粮的高正东及收款的狗腿衙役；8、9月，杀了薛家峁区长薛运统，高利贷崔化成，士绅白××。这样一来，绥清地区的游击战争开展起来了，二支队就在这样轰轰烈烈的群众斗争中，诞生了！并随着群众斗争的开展，迅速地壮大起来，到1934年，便扩大成为红军二十七军八十四师的第二团了。
    腊八大会
    清涧县的解家沟，是离黄河不远的一个较大的市镇。
    1933年腊月初八，一年最后的一次集市——腊八大会到了。因为一年来的经济关系，好歹都要在这个时候作个交代，所以赶会的人特别多。地主、豪绅、高利贷和衙役狗腿子们，也趁这个时候来催粮逼债；黄河对岸山西的许多小商贩，也贩运着各种土产“年货”洋货赶会来了。于是，我们的党组织和游击队，便利用这个绝好的群众场合，散发了大量的传单，揭发土豪劣绅的罪恶，宣传红军、工农政府是工人农民自己的武装和政权，号召人民群众组织起来，武装起来，打倒土豪劣绅，推翻封建制度……
    安定的一支队因为军事冒险，攻坚失败，把剩下的十余支枪埋了起来，我们接到报告后，立即派张爱民带十多个同志组成了一个江湖班子（类似现在的曲艺队），一路上用说唱作掩护赶去安定，将埋藏的枪支取出，星夜赶回了清涧。腊八会的前一天，我化装成一个卖年画的，和他们赶到这里，住在距解家沟十里左右的王家山，二支队也调来了，共同讨论将一支队的武装返回安定活动的问题。
    王家山。是清涧最先“公开”的一个村庄。（公开，就是全村人都赞成革命，我们可以公开活动。）因此，我们计划白天好好休息，夜晚西渡无定河向安定转移。同志们正兴高采烈地擦着武器，一个队员不小心，“砰！”的一声，冲锋手枪走火了，队长批评他：“幸亏是在公开的村庄，不然就叫你暴露目标了。”
    另一个队员却接过话头，开了个玩笑：“队长，枪走火是想吃人哩，这是打仗的预兆！”
     不一会，果然发现了敌人，好几十个民团从村旁小道上过去了。队员们要开枪，队长制止了他们。那个好开玩笑的队员叹了口气：“哎！又打不成了！”
    太阳慢慢地落下山坡，赶会的人们，有的已经开始往回返了。这时，解家沟的一个新党员白玉华同志气喘喘地跑了来，说：“今天的传单把赶会的人都轰动了，大家都说好，可是老乡们又说：‘你们光说不做，今天镇上那样多无恶不作的大土豪，你们怎么不杀！？有逼粮逼税的狗腿子，你们怎么不管！？’”
    白玉华同志一番话将大伙心里的火点燃了。实在，“腊八会”集中了四方恶霸，真是摆酒席也请不齐的。支队长白雪山用眼瞅着我，意思是：“你看怎么办好呢？”我说：“咱们大伙合计合计吧。”
    我刚说完，队员们就争先恐后你一言我一语的说起来了，大家一致认为：这是送上门的“生意”，不能不干。于是决定立即进行准备，只待黄昏到来。
    日落西山，天色渐暗。等到掌灯时分，赶集的人已经散了。我们便分三路下山，把土豪们住的院子全部围了起来。这夜，风特别大，吹起了遍地的雪花，扑在脸上冷飕飕的，但年青的我们，心却热得很。土豪恶棍狗腿子一个也未漏，统统捉住了。我们警告了民愤比较轻的，至于农民恨之入骨的恶霸，不客气，一家伙拖到河滩上杀了九个半——一个用石头砸了个半死。镇上人见到我们不光说“打倒土豪”硬是真干，心里确是万分痛快，说：“杀得好，杀了这些坏家伙，咱穷苦百姓也好松口气了……。”
    “腊八会”捕杀了一批地主豪绅，这消息使远近各城镇大大为之震动，扩大了共产党、红军的影响，提高了广大群众的觉悟，这消息，也随着来赶会的山西小商贩，像风似地传过了黄河，山西人民也说：“这下救星到啦，陕北有了许多红军，厉害得很呢！这队伍可真是给穷苦百姓办事情的……。”
    小岔子村出了大事情
    1934年春夏之交，我随着二支队到清涧县城区巡视工作，住在离县城约十里地的小岔子村。在这里，我们召开了区委会，讨论如何开展城区的工作，“公开”城区的村庄。
    小岔子其实并不算小，计有百余户人家，在陕北还算较大的村庄了。这个村里，党的工作很有基础，还在大革命时期，这个村就闹得轰轰烈烈的，广大群众受革命的影响很深，34年当时，差不多已经是公开的村庄了。因此，我们刚刚住下，村里的“无线电话”〔注一〕就布置好了，只要城里的白军一动，我们就立刻知道，大伙很放心，连警戒也未放。
    这个村里，人们除了种庄稼从事农业生产之外，副业生产也极为普遍。不是推粉喂猪，就是作挂面，差不多家家户户都有副业。游击队一来，老乡们欢迎极了，纷纷把游击队员请到自己家去吃挂面。我们忙着开会，顾不上到各家各户去串门。哪知道我们正开会的时候，白军董连长带着一连人，从黄河岸边的河口开来，路过小岔子去清涧城换防。我们没料到白军会从黄河边来，敌人也不知道我们在这里，敌人进村了，一位老大娘慌慌张张地跑进来：“快快！上山去，白军进村了！”
    老大娘的话刚落音，枪声响了。我们的游击队员提着枪四面八方从窑洞里跑出来，与白军干开了，一边打，一边抢占山头。我收拾好文件正要出门时，子弹呼呼地朝院落射来，封住了出路。这时，亏得一位从白军争取过来的队员，他有战斗经验，枪法很好，在他的火力掩护下，我们也冲了出来，撤到了山上。
    上山以后，敌人摸不清我们的底细，也不敢冒进，于是双方就在山头上对峙了一天。
    黄昏，白军退回清涧城了，我们也转移到附近的一个山村宿营。晚上，大家就在一起研究如何来对付敌人，怎样保护小岔子村不受敌人的摧残，开展“公开”城区村庄的工作。这时，一个平常最不爱讲话的队员，绰号叫做“笨人”的，想出了一条妙计。他说：“明天，白军一定要到小岔子来的，我们化装成老百姓埋伏在村子里，他不来便罢，要来，就打他个措手不及。”我们一想这办法很对，就同意了他的意见，布置了工作。
    第二天，白军果然来了，首先是民团团长领着几个团丁跑进村来“招安”〔注二〕。他们刚进村，“笨人”便敲起了锣来，扯开嗓门喊着：“老乡们，团长要训话，你们赶快出来听啦，团长说：隐藏红军不报的要杀全家，要交出来就既往不咎咧！……”
    “笨人”一喊，把埋伏好的队员都喊出来了。游击队的同志大多数是农民，再一化装，更像庄稼汉。大家装成老老实实来听训话的，一下子包围了民团。首先打死了民团团长，接着把团丁的枪也缴了，村外的白军一听枪响，知道情况不妙，更不敢冒然进村，我们也立刻把队伍拉到山上。
    情况很紧张了。把进村的民团歼灭了。白军在离我们三里地的大岔子村，向我们进行火力侦察。老百姓不敢在村里呆了，怕白军进村烧杀，纷纷扶老携幼，卷起铺盖，拉着牲口，跟我们上了山。这一下热闹了，娃娃哭，妇女叫，个个眼盯着游击队。我心里焦急万分，怎么办呢？便叫游击队掩护着全村老小几百口人，转移到一个较隐蔽的山洼里。把队伍布置好后，就把老乡们召集在一起开会，首先向老乡们说明：“老乡们，现在问题闹大了，如今摆在我们面前的，只有两条路：一条是回村去向白军投降，任敌人宰割；另一条是全村老小都组织起来，闹革命！把‘无线电话’搞好，成立赤卫队。留下少数的年青力壮的赤卫队去整治那些敌探流氓，保护村庄。敌人来了就转移。其余的男女老少都去走亲戚，每个人负责向自己的亲戚朋友宣传，让家家都向着红军，把左右附近的村庄都闹红，咱们人多力量也就大了，白军就没有办法……。”
    山坡上许多人脸上露出了喜色，但还有些人犹疑不定。我们刚要想再讲清楚道理，只见一位老汉忽地站起来，愤怒地说：“这有什么犹豫的，白军就是不叫咱们活，回村投降就是等死，只有组织起来闹革命才是一条活路……。”
    “对！闹起来，咱们都去走亲戚！”
    “闹到底，闹红陕北，跟上红军和高桂滋拼！……”
    “…………。”
    老乡们是激怒了，本来是胆小的人，看到许多飞舞的拳头、梭镖，也决心跟着游击队干。这时，有一个三十多岁的人（党员），看样子社会经验挺丰富，他恐怕人多心不齐，走漏了风声，就趁势站起来说道：“要干，咱们就只能有一个心眼，谁也不许中途变卦，谁也不许出卖自己人！……”
    “那还用说，绝不向敌人妥协！”
    “那个告密杀他的头！”
    群众的斗争情绪真是节节高涨，全村男女老少，四、五百口人就连夜携家带眷，赶着牲口，抄小路投各人的亲戚家去了。区委也立刻通知各村党的组织，把土豪劣绅暗地看守起来，好好接待小岔子村去的群众，加紧突击“公开”村庄的工作，组织贫农会、赤卫队。清涧一带原来就是游击队经常活动的地区，群众觉悟较高，经过小岔子村这样一闹，附近几个村庄，很快就全给闹红了。
    随着游击战争的开展，游击区迅速地扩大，在安定、绥德、清涧、神木、府谷、葭、吴堡等县游击区，建立了乡、区、县苏维埃。年底，成立了陕北省工农政府。贫农团、赤卫队、少先队等群众组织也普遍公开建立。就在这一年，安定的一支队、绥德清涧的二支队、神木、府谷的三支队、葭县吴堡的四支队，改编为红一、二、三、四团，到12月省工农政府成立时，就成立了中国工农红军第二十七军八十四师（后改为八十一师），并建立了十八个游击支队。从此，游击区的党，也就由秘密的、非法的变为公开的、合法的了。
    到1935年，这是陕北革命大发展的一年。陕北游击队在1934年底改编为红二十七军八十四师后，就在刘志丹同志的率领下，首战南沟岔歼灭高桂滋的一个连，随即，又配合红二十六军主力于清涧县河口镇，高杰村、定仙墕、张家屹台、葭县的慕家?、安定的杨家园子等处，整营整团整旅的歼灭敌人。并于红二十五军入陕前，占领了延长、延川、安定、保安、安寨等县。（红二十五军是1935年9月18日在永坪与二十六、二十七军会师的）粉碎了高桂滋、关麟征、孙楚、李生达等军阀对陕北苏区的进攻围剿。一度曾因为陕北游击队主力南下陕甘苏区，与红二十六军会合而未遭到打击的高桂滋，也慌了手脚了，他原来在这时曾给蒋介石发去八个字的电报、说什么：“一弹未发，赤匪已平。”简直骄傲的不得了，尾巴翘得老高，现在，却不能不张惶失措、手忙脚乱的向蒋介石发报求援报丧了。他的电报原文是：“防广兵单、防不胜防，若不增兵，陕北将成第二江西也！”
    〔注一〕无线电话：每个山头放一个哨，敌军一出动，我们就得到消息。
    〔注二〕招安：即敌人来招降。
