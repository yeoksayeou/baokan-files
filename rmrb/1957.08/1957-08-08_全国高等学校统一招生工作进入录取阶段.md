Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch: The national unified college entrance examination has entered the admission phase. Around August 23rd, colleges and universities across the country will issue admission notices to newly admitted students. At the same time, the admission committees in various regions will also issue rejection notices to candidates who were not admitted.

This year, the College Admissions Committee's criteria for admitting new students are based on the principles of ensuring political quality, academic level, physical condition, and fulfillment of the plan. In recent years, with continuous improvements in teaching and the quality of teaching in middle schools, there has been a good trend of gradually increasing academic examination scores of candidates compared to the past. Judging from the examination scores of graduates from three senior high schools with different levels in the Beijing examination area, the total average score of candidates applying for science and engineering majors this year is about four points higher than last year.

This year's source of candidates is relatively abundant, and the candidates' choices of majors are relatively dispersed. After admission according to the qualification standards and the candidates' preferences, it is estimated that there will not be many schools and majors with vacancies, and the number of vacancies in schools and majors with vacancies will be minimal. Therefore, according to the National College Admissions Committee's estimation, some schools are expected to re-solicit candidates' preferences. However, whether some colleges and universities will hold a second entrance examination according to this year's admission regulations will depend on whether schools that have not filled their quotas are unwilling to adopt the method of soliciting preferences and prefer to use the method of holding another entrance examination to complete the enrollment task. If some schools are willing to hold another entrance examination, the specific methods will be announced by the relevant colleges and universities in the newspapers. Schools that re-select preferences and schools that hold another examination will still adhere to the principle of selecting the best candidates. The notice for re-selecting preferences will be issued at the same time as the rejection notice.

    全国高等学校统一招生工作进入录取阶段
    新华社7日讯　全国高等学校统一招生已进入录取阶段。在8月23日左右，全国高等学校即可向录取的新生发出录取通知书。同时，各地区招生工作委员会也要向未录取的考生发出不录取通知书。
    今年高等学校招生委员会对于录取新生的标准是根据保证政治质量、学科水平、身体条件及完成计划的原则来确定的。由于近年来中学不断地改进教学、提高教学质量，今年考生的学科考试成绩与以往比较有逐年提高的好现象。从北京考区三种水平不同的高级中学的毕业生考试成绩来看，今年报考理工类考生的学科考试总平均成绩比去年约提高四分左右。
    今年的考生来源比较充裕，考生所填志愿又比较分散，按合格标准和考生志愿录取后，估计有缺额的学校和专业不会很多，有缺额的学校和专业所缺数额也会是极少的。因此，据全国高等学校招生委员会估计，重新征求考生志愿的学校估计会有一些，但是否有高等学校根据今年的招生规定举行第二次招生考试，将取决于没有录取满额的学校，不愿意采取征求志愿的办法，而愿意用再次举行招生考试的办法来完成招生任务。如有的学校愿意再次举行招生考试，具体办法将由有关的高等学校在报纸上公布。重新选填志愿的学校和再次举行考试的学校仍然要根据择优录取的原则。重新选填志愿的通知将和不录取通知书同时发出。
