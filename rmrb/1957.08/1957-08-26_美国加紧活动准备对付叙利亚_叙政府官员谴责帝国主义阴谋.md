Xinhua News Agency, August 25th, Damascus Dispatch: Syrian Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief and Chief of Staff, General Bizri, accused Lebanon on the 24th of "inciting criminal and subversive activities" in Syria.

　　When meeting with Lebanese reporters, Bizri said: "The Lebanese government is clearly determined to continue implementing a policy of friction." He said, however, that Syria has adopted a tolerant attitude towards Lebanon's activities and will not take actions that harm Lebanon.

　　When a reporter asked whether Syrian-Lebanese relations could improve, Bizri said: "Of course they can improve, if both sides recognize the existence of Israel and the true intentions of those who support it."

　　One reporter said that Lebanon adopted a pro-Western policy in order to protect itself from imperialism. Bizri said: "We only ask that Lebanon maintain and defend its own independence. It is unrealistic to say that Lebanon allows imperialism to dominate and interfere in its internal affairs out of fear of imperialism."

　　Referring to the US-engineered conspiracy to subvert the Syrian government, Bizri said, "There is concrete evidence of the meetings convened by the conspirators and their plans." Details of the conspiracy will be published in the newspapers in the next few days.

　　Xinhua News Agency, August 25th, Damascus Dispatch: Syrian Education Minister Sibai said on the 24th that US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Henderson's visit to Turkey was to "create a new conspiracy against Syria."

　　Sibai told a reporter from the Syrian "Banner" newspaper: "We believe that these conspiracies will surely be crushed, because the Syrian people and the people of other Arab countries are vigilant, and they will not allow anyone to strike at Arab nationalism."

　　Well-informed Syrian diplomatic sources told a reporter from the "Masses" newspaper that King Hussein of Jordan and King Faisal of Iraq are in Turkey discussing with Turkish Prime Minister Menderes joint actions to be taken against Syria.

　　These sources also said that the governments of Lebanon, Turkey, Iraq, and Jordan intend to strengthen their political offensive against Syria. They intend to slander Syria's relations with the Soviet Union, greatly weaken these countries' economic relations with Syria, try to limit diplomatic relations with the Syrian government, and greatly strengthen border crossing rules in order to disrupt normal traffic between Syria and the aforementioned countries.

　　Xinhua News Agency, August 25th, Istanbul Dispatch: US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Henderson arrived in Istanbul on the 24th and met with Turkish Prime Minister Menderes that afternoon. Henderson said after the meeting that the development of the Syrian situation was one of the issues they discussed.

　　On the same day, King Hussein of Jordan and King Faisal of Iraq held two meetings with the Turkish President and Prime Minister in Istanbul to discuss the Middle East situation.

　　According to Western news agencies, Henderson's sudden trip to Turkey was tasked with planning the countermeasures of the United States and "its friends" against Syria. These reports say that the United States currently intends to use pro-Western Arab countries around Syria to exert pressure on Syria and instigate subversive activities. Henderson first came to Turkey because he could immediately contact the Turkish Prime Minister and the King of Jordan and the King of Iraq, who were visiting Turkey. Turkey and Iraq are both members of the Baghdad Pact, and Jordan has openly sided with the United States since the coup that overthrew the nationalist government in April this year.

　　Henderson is known as an expert on US Middle East affairs. He represented the United States at the Baghdad Pact Council meeting in June this year.

　　Xinhua News Agency, August 25th, London Dispatch via Reuters: A committee of the Baghdad Pact Organization will meet in London on September 27 to discuss the Syrian situation. The United States will participate in the meeting together with the five participating countries of the Baghdad Pact—Britain, Turkey, Pakistan, Iran, and Iraq.

　　Prior to this, London diplomats had revealed that Western countries were preparing to use the Baghdad Pact's "Anti-Subversion Committee" to interfere in Syrian politics.

　　Although the United States has not formally joined the Baghdad Pact, it is a member of the treaty's "Anti-Subversion Committee" and "Military Committee."

    美国加紧活动准备对付叙利亚
　　叙政府官员谴责帝国主义阴谋
    据新华社25日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚武装部队总司令兼参谋长比兹里将军24日指责黎巴嫩在叙利亚“煽动犯罪和颠覆活动”。
    比兹里在接见黎巴嫩记者时说：“黎巴嫩政府显然是决心继续执行摩擦政策的。”他说，但是，叙利亚对黎巴嫩的活动采取了宽容态度，它不会采取损害黎巴嫩的行动。
    当记者问到叙黎关系是否能够改善时，比兹里说：“当然能够改善，如果双方都认识到以色列的存在以及那些支持它的人们的真正目的。”
    有一个记者说，黎巴嫩采取亲西方政策是为了保全自己免受帝国主义之害。比兹里说：“我们只要求黎巴嫩维护并保卫自己的独立。这样的说法是不现实的：黎巴嫩由于害怕帝国主义才促使它让帝国主义支配自己并干涉自己的内政。”
    谈到美国策动的颠覆叙利亚政府的阴谋时，比兹里说，“阴谋者召开的会议和他们的计划都有确实证据”。今后几天中将要在报上发表阴谋案的详细情况。
    新华社25日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚教育部长西巴伊24日说，美国副国务卿帮办汉德逊访问土耳其是要“制造反对叙利亚的新阴谋”。
    西巴伊对叙利亚“旗帜报”记者说：“我们相信这些阴谋是一定要被粉碎的，因为叙利亚人民和其它阿拉伯国家的人民正在警惕着，他们是不允许任何人打击阿拉伯民族主义的。”
    叙利亚消息灵通的外交界人士对“群众报”记者说，约旦国王侯赛因和伊拉克国王费萨尔正在土耳其同土耳其总理曼德列斯商谈要对叙利亚采取的共同行动。
    这些人士还说，黎巴嫩、土耳其、伊拉克和约旦四国的政府打算加强政治攻势来反对叙利亚。它们打算诽谤叙利亚同苏联的关系，大大削弱这些国家同叙利亚的经济关系，竭力限制同叙利亚政府的外交关系并且大大加强国境通行规则以便破坏叙利亚同上述国家之间的正常交通。
    新华社25日讯　伊斯坦布尔消息：美国副国务卿帮办汉德逊24日到达伊斯坦布尔，并且在当天下午会见了土耳其总理曼德列斯。汉德逊在会谈后说，叙利亚形势的发展是他们讨论的问题之一。
    同一天，约旦国王侯赛因、伊拉克国王费萨尔同土耳其总统和总理在伊斯坦布尔举行了两次会议，讨论中东局势。
    据西方通讯社透露，汉德逊突然去土耳其的任务是要策划美国和
  “它的朋友们”对付叙利亚的对策。这些消息说，美国目前打算利用叙利亚周围亲西方的阿拉伯国家来对叙利亚施加压力和策动颠覆活动。汉德逊首先来到土耳其，就是因为在那里可以立即同土耳其总理和正在土耳其访问的约旦国王、伊拉克国王接触。土耳其和伊拉克都是巴格达条约的成员国，约旦在今年4月发生推翻民族主义政府的政变后已经公开投靠美国。
    汉德逊被称为是美国中东事务的专家。他曾经在今年6月代表美国列席巴格达条约理事会会议。
    新华社25日讯　据路透社伦敦消息，巴格达条约组织的一个委员会将在9月27日在伦敦开会，讨论叙利亚局势。届时美国将和巴格达条约的五个参加国——英国、土耳其、巴基斯坦、伊朗和伊拉克一道参加会议。
    在这以前，伦敦外交人士曾经透露，西方国家正在准备利用巴格达条约的“反颠覆委员会”来干涉叙利亚政局。
    美国虽然没有正式参加巴格达条约，但是它是这个条约的“反颠覆委员会”和“军事委员会”的成员。
