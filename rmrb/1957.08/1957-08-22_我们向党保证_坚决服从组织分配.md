　　We Pledge to the Party
　　Resolutely Obey Organizational Assignments
    We are fifth-year students majoring in Engine Design at the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics. On the eve of leaving school and entering society, we pledge to the Party: We will resolutely obey organizational assignments.
    At the time of liberation, we were still young children in our teens, not understanding life and lacking knowledge. Over the past eight years, it is the Party that has nurtured our growth, taught us revolutionary principles, and enabled us to learn the skills to build our country.
    Now, we have completed our university studies, and the time has come for us to contribute our strength to socialist construction. We are the young generation cultivated by the Party. Wherever socialist construction needs us, we will certainly go. Obeying organizational assignments and voluntarily going to the most arduous jobs is our bounden duty.
    All students of Classes 2301-2303, graduating class of Beijing Institute of Aeronautics

　　我们向党保证
　　坚决服从组织分配
    我们是北京航空学院发动机设计专业五年级学生，在离开学校走向社会的前夕，我们向党保证：坚决服从组织分配。
    解放时，我们还是十几岁的年青娃娃，不懂得生活，也没有知识。八年来是党亲手抚育我们成长，教导我们懂得革命道理，学习了建设祖国的本领。
    现在我们已经结束了大学生活，为社会主义建设贡献力量的时候到了。我们是党亲手培养出来的年青一代，社会主义建设需要我们到哪里，我们就一定到哪里。服从组织分配，自愿走向最艰苦的工作岗位，是我们的天职。
    北京航空学院应届毕业生2301—2303班全体学生
