    Garlic Pretending to be a Daffodil
    Yan Ling
    Yesterday singing the white-faced role,
    Today singing the red-faced role;
    The face changes, but the heart doesn't,
    The more he sings, the more off-key he goes.
    During the rectification campaign, he spoke,
    Truly spicy and truly sour;
    During the anti-rightist campaign, he spoke,
    Lightly and faintly.
    When talking about "shortcomings,"
    Lively and vivid;
    When talking about achievements,
    Formulas and concepts.
    Originally garlic,
    Insisting on pretending to be a daffodil;
    The seeds haven't been changed,
    Transformation is difficult upon difficult.

    大蒜装水仙
    燕凌
    昨天唱白脸，
    今天唱红脸；
    脸变心没变，
    越唱越走板。
    整风他发言，
    真辣也真酸；
    反右他讲话，
    轻轻又淡淡。
    说起“缺点”来，
    活龙又活现；
    说起成绩来，
    公式加概念。
    本来是大蒜，
    偏要装水仙；
    种子没有换，
    要变难上难。
