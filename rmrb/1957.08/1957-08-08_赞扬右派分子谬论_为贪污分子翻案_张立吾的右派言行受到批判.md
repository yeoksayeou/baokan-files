Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 6th. Zhang Liwu, a member of the Shenyang Municipal People's Committee, Vice President of Northeast Institute of Technology, and probationary member of the Chinese Communist Party, has had his anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiracy foiled. In recent days, Party member cadres and faculty and staff members remaining at the Northeast Institute of Technology during the summer vacation have criticized his rightist words and deeds.

Zhang Liwu, who claimed to have followed the revolution for twenty years, actually smeared the Party, saying, "The Party is under the rule of dogmatism, without a single glimmer of light, just a bleak and desolate scene, as if you can't see any flowers or plants in the desert." This Zhang Liwu, who holds the position of member of the Municipal People's Committee and Vice President, even said that the Communist Party is a sectarian party, saying, "The fundamental problem of Northeast Institute of Technology is sectarianism. I am an example of being persecuted by sectarianism."

When rightist elements attacked the school, Zhang rushed around to various departments, adding fuel to the fire, and incited Liu Zhixin and others, the deputy director of academic affairs. He condoned Wang Tao, a corrupt element in the "Three-Anti" campaign, and Wang's older brother, Wang Wen-yue, to overturn their cases and attack the Party. Zhang Liwu also lavishly praised the speeches of the main anti-Party and anti-socialist rightist elements in Shenyang City. He also praised Xu Yetong (professor at Northeast Institute of Technology), who fired poisonous arrows at the Provincial Political Consultative Conference, as "the first bold person in Donggong who dared to uphold justice." Zhang Liwu believes that "the Party cannot lead higher education institutions."

    赞扬右派分子谬论　为贪污分子翻案
    张立吾的右派言行受到批判
    据新华社沈阳6日电　沈阳市人民委员会委员、东北工学院副院长、中共预备党员张立吾的反党反社会主义阴谋遭到破产。近几天，东北工学院党员干部和暑假留校教职员批判了他的右派言行。
    自称追随革命二十年的张立吾竟污蔑“党是在教条主义统治下，没有一点闪光，只是灰溜溜一片，好像在沙漠中看不见什么花草一样”。这位身为市人民委员会委员、副院长的张立吾竟说共产党是宗派主义的政党，说“东北工学院根本问题就是宗派主义、我就是被宗派主义迫害的一例”。
    当右派分子向学校进攻的时候，张奔走各系，火上加油，并向副教务长刘致信等人进行煽动。他纵容“三反”中的贪污分子王鞱和王的哥哥王文樾起来翻案，向党进攻。张立吾并对沈阳市反党反社会主义的主要右派分子的言论备加赞扬。他还赞扬在省政协会施放毒箭的徐冶同（东北工学院教授）为“东工第一个敢于主持正义的大胆人”。张立吾认为“党不能领导高等学校”。
