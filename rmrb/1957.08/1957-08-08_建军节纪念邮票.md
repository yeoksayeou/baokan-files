    Commemorative Stamps for Army Day
    This newspaper reports that, in order to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has decided to issue a set of four commemorative stamps entitled "The 30th Anniversary of the Founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army." Due to a rush in printing, the first and third stamps will be sold first on August 10th. These two stamps are the four-cent light purple "Nanchang Uprising" and the eight-cent tea-brown "Eighth Route Army Crossing the Yellow River." The other two stamps are the four-cent black-green "Jinggangshan Meeting" and the eight-cent black-gray "Liberation of Nanjing."
