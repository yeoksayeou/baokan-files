Xinhua News Agency, August 1st—According to revelations and evidence presented during seven large and small meetings of the Journalism Work Symposium from July 25th to August 1st, Wang Zhong, the director of the Journalism Department of Fudan University, who wears the cloak of a Communist Party member, is completely an agent of the bourgeois rightists in the people’s journalism and cultural education undertaking.

Wang Zhong's anti-Party, anti-Marxist-Leninist, bourgeois reactionary program is a so-called "Outline of Principles of Journalism" of about 50,000 words. In this work, Wang Zhong believes that newspapers are not a product of class struggle, that "reader needs" and "serving readers" are the nature of newspapers, also known as "commodity characteristics." As for the class nature of newspapers and newspapers as a tool of class struggle, Wang Zhong believes that this is forcibly added by political parties. Wang Zhong regards the Party spirit and the people's spirit of newspapers as opposing contradictions. Wang Zhong said that the People's Daily and all other provincial party committee newspapers are "grim-faced" and the editors of the newspapers are like "Puritans." He compares the Party newspaper to the "Dibao" and "official newspapers" of the ruling class in history. Wang Zhong believes that the Party spirit of newspapers is caused by people "treating newspapers as the Party's propaganda weapon." Wang Zhong said that the Party committee "restricts" newspapers. Newspapers are not "free" and become "widow's faces." To lift the "restrictions," it is necessary to overthrow what Wang Zhong calls "officialism, secretariatism," which is to abolish the Communist Party's leadership over newspapers and make Party newspapers degenerate. Wang Zhong demanded and propagated everywhere that newspapers should not "guide work." He believes that with more guidance in guiding economic construction, there is less "service," and the contradiction between "editing and selling newspapers" and "buying and reading newspapers" becomes sharp. Wang Zhong said that this is the result of "dogmatism" in the newspaper editorial department. Wang Zhong also advocated turning the People's Daily and the current provincial party committee newspapers into work reports and "internal bulletins," and establishing so-called mass "economic regional" newspapers. In fact, Wang Zhong's conspiracy is to isolate and attack the Party newspaper, and to advocate running some bourgeois fellow-traveler newspapers and social newspapers.

Wang Zhong's set of anti-Party journalism programs is by no means, as he himself claims, merely an academic study, but is systematically and organizationally promoted and disseminated in various news units, attempting to use his program as the guiding ideology of local Party newspapers, and to tamper with the political direction of Party newspapers. Last year, he led a "survey team" to the Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station, Wuxi Worker's Life Daily, Nanjing Xinhua Daily, Jinan Dazhong Daily, Qingdao Daily and other places to investigate the shortcomings of newspapers and so-called "reader needs." Wherever he went, he gave lectures and reports, peddling his program. During the investigation, he always exaggerated and magnified the shortcomings of the newspapers. During the investigation, he tried to win over people who resonated with him, and incited these people's dissatisfaction with the Party committee's leadership of the newspapers. After the investigation, he often exaggerated the shortcomings of the Party newspaper to the students, to prove that the current newspaper must be changed according to his theory. In May of this year, he came to Beijing to participate in the Journalism Work Symposium. At this meeting, many rightists made many reactionary remarks, which he greatly appreciated. On the way back to Shanghai, he went to Jinan and Nanjing to convey these reactionary remarks in the press.

Within the Journalism Department of Fudan University, Wang Zhong has also consistently wooed teachers and students, engaged in factional activities, and peddled his anti-Party journalism program. He encouraged teachers in the department to carry out teaching work in accordance with his program, to "endure hardship and plan for ten years," and to create a "school of thought" under his leadership. He advocated that graduates of the Journalism Department of Fudan University should be permanently assigned to news units in several provinces, so that they could frequently "contact" and "help" each other. He also encouraged his students to go to non-Party newspapers and local newspapers, saying that there was "a lot to be done" in these places, and told students not to enter large news organizations such as the People's Daily and Xinhua News Agency. He also often promoted to students how bad the Party spirit of newspapers is, and asked students to develop their personality. He often verbally abused the old cadres of the Communist Party in front of the students, saying that the old cadres have no culture and no knowledge. He also provocatively said that the Journalism Department of Peking University has become a colony and appendage of the Journalism Department of Renmin University of China, and said that Renmin University is a base of dogmatism.

Whenever he had the opportunity, Wang Zhong would find graduates of the Journalism Department of Fudan University who work in news units in various places to collude and win them over, and promote his reactionary program. In May of this year, when he was in Beijing, he had extensive contact with some Fudan University graduates from various news units in Beijing. Many of these students have been poisoned by Wang Zhong's reactionary ideas. Some people, because they want to develop their "personality," expressed dissatisfaction with their current positions in the People's Daily and Xinhua News Agency; some even ridiculed and slandered the Party's leadership over newspapers. When Wang Zhong heard these remarks, he provoked them even more, saying, "I told you a long time ago not to just think about entering large organizations like the People's Daily and Xinhua News Agency. You didn't listen, you deserve it."

Wang Zhong felt close to many rightists and certain people's rightist remarks. He openly said that he appreciates the bourgeois set of ideas. He also often said that he does not read the People's Daily, and when he reads the Liberation Daily, he also looks for "interesting" things. He really wants to read Shanghai's Xinmin Evening News and Wenhui Daily. He did not go to the Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Liberation Daily to understand some of the policies and principles concerning propaganda work, but often listened to the ambiguous conveyances of a lecturer in the Journalism Department who also worked part-time at Wenhui Daily.

At the Journalism Work Symposium, Wang Zhong was always evasive, stuttering, and said that his mistakes were only in academic thought, attempting to muddle through. People in the news industry are deeply dissatisfied with Wang Zhong's attitude. The Journalism Symposium will continue to systematically criticize Wang Zhong's anti-Party words and deeds, and is warning Wang Zhong to correct his attitude and make a serious confession.

    右派在新闻事业中的代理人
    王中的反党新闻学纲领受到抨击
    据新华社1日讯　根据新闻工作座谈会从7月25日到8月1日连续举行的七次大会和小会的揭露证实，披着共产党员外衣的复旦大学新闻系主任王中完全是资产阶级右派在人民新闻和文教事业中的代理人。
    王中的反党、反马克思列宁主义的资产阶级的反动纲领，是一本长约五万言的所谓“新闻学原理大纲”。在这本著作中，王中认为报纸不是阶级斗争的产物，认为“读者需要”和“为读者服务”是报纸的本性，又称为“商品性”。至于报纸的阶级性和报纸作为阶级斗争的工具，王中认为这是政党给硬加进去的。王中把报纸的党性和人民性看成是对立的矛盾。王中说人民日报及其它一切省委机关报是“满脸铁青”，报纸的编辑像“清教徒”。他把党报同历史上统治阶级的“邸报”、“官报”相提并论。王中认为，报纸的党性是由于人们“把报纸当作党的宣传武器”所造成的。王中说，党委“约束”、“限制”报纸。报纸不“自由”，变成了“寡妇脸”。要解除“约束”，就必须打倒王中所说的“机关性、书记性”，就是取消共产党对报纸的领导，使党报变质。王中要求并且到处宣传报纸不要“指导工作”，他认为多了指导经济建设的指导性，少了“服务性”，“编报卖”与“买报看”就成了尖锐的矛盾。王中说，这是报纸编辑部“教条主义”的结果。王中还主张把人民日报和现在的省委机关报变成工作报和“内部通报”，另成立所谓群众性的“经济区域”报。实际上王中的阴谋就是孤立和打击党报，提倡办一些资产阶级的同人报、社会报。
    王中对自己的一套反党的新闻学纲领，绝不是像他自己所声称的仅仅是作为一种学术研究，而是有计划有组织地在各地新闻单位进行宣扬、传播，企图用他的纲领来作为各地党报的指导思想，篡改党报的政治方向。去年他曾率领一个“调查组”到上海人民广播电台、无锡工人生活报、南京新华日报、济南大众日报、青岛日报等处调查报纸的缺点和所谓“读者的需要”，每到一地，他就讲演报告，贩卖他的纲领。在调查时对报纸的缺点总是加以渲染夸大。在调查中处处拉拢和他有共鸣的人，并煽动这些人对党委领导报纸的不满情绪。调查以后，他就经常在学生中夸大党报的缺点，来证明目前的报纸非照他的理论改变不可。今年5月，他来北京参加了新闻工作座谈会。在这次会上，许多右派分子发表许多反动的言论，他大为欣赏。回上海的途中，他又到济南、南京，在新闻界传达这些反动言论。
    在复旦大学新闻系内，王中也一贯拉拢师生，搞宗派活动，兜售他的反党的新闻学纲领。他鼓励系内教师按照他的纲领进行教学工作，要“卧薪尝胆搞十年”，在自己的领导下搞成一个“学派”。他主张复旦大学新闻系的毕业生要固定地分配给几个省的新闻单位，以便经常和他们互相“联系”互相“帮助”。他还鼓励他的学生到非党报纸和地方报纸去，说在这些地方“大有可为”，叫学生不要进人民日报、新华社等大新闻机关。他还经常在学生面前宣传报纸的党性如何不好，要学生发展个性。他经常对学生辱骂共产党的老干部，说老干部没有文化没有知识。他还带挑拨性说北京大学新闻专业已变成中国人民大学新闻系的殖民地、附属国，并且说人民大学是教条主义的大本营。
    王中一有机会，就找在各地新闻单位工作的复旦大学新闻系的毕业生进行串连拉拢，宣传他的反动纲领。今年5月，他在北京，就曾和北京各新闻单位的一些复旦大学毕业生有过广泛的接触。这些学生中有很多人受了王中的反动思想的毒害，有人因为要发展“个性”，对他们现在在人民日报、新华社的工作岗位表示不满；有人甚至对党对报纸的领导进行嘲笑、诋毁。王中在听到这些言论的时候，就更加以挑拨，他说“我老早说叫你们不要只想进人民日报、新华社这种大机关，你们不听，活该。”
    王中对许多右派分子以及某些人的右派言论他都感到亲切。他公开说他欣赏资产阶级的一套。他还常说，他是不看人民日报的，看解放日报也是寻找有“趣味”的事情，他真正愿意看的是上海的新民报和文汇报。一些关于宣传工作的方针政策，他不是到中共上海市委宣传部和解放日报去了解，而是经常听一个在文汇报兼职的新闻系讲师的似是而非的传达。
    在新闻工作座谈会上，王中始终躲躲闪闪，吞吞吐吐，说自己只是学术思想上的错误，企图蒙混过关。新闻界人士对王中的态度深为不满，新闻座谈会还要继续对王中的反党言行进行系统的批判，并正告王中端正态度，认真交代。
