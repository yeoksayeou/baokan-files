Rich and Colorful River Lantern and Fireworks Garden Party

　　This newspaper reports that last night, the sky over Beijing was clear and the air was relatively cool for an autumn evening. To enrich the cultural and recreational life of the capital's citizens, Beihai Park held a river lantern and fireworks garden party.

　　Watching river lanterns is a traditional custom for Beijing citizens. In the past, Beihai Park would release river lanterns every year on the 15th day of the 7th lunar month. This year, it was originally scheduled to be held twice in a row on the 29th and 30th, but the 29th night was suspended due to rain and postponed to September 2nd.

　　Thirty thousand citizens attended last night's garden party. It is said that this was the largest river lantern release since liberation. After nightfall, Beihai Park was brightly lit, as if it were daytime. Five thousand bright, colorful river lanterns floated on the lake with the wind, like brilliant constellations in the sky. The Beijing Fireworks Production Cooperative specially made fifteen kinds of fireworks, including the beautiful fireworks we saw during the "May Day" and National Day celebrations, as well as various traditional ancient fireworks, with novel and diverse patterns and brilliant colors, creating a dazzling display of light and fire that pierced the night sky.

　　While the fireworks and river lanterns illuminated each other, there was also classical music performed on the lake. In addition, there were rich and colorful performances of Beijing opera, Ping opera, folk art, shadow puppetry, movies, acrobatics, and other cultural programs to add to the fun. There was also a Xiangqi (Chinese chess) performance match between Beijing's famous players Zhang Dekui and Yang Changsheng. People dispersed joyfully until late at night.

　　丰富多采的河灯焰火游园晚会
    本报讯　昨夜，北京天高气爽，是入秋以来比较凉快的一个夜晚，北海公园为了丰富首都市民的文娱生活，举办了河灯焰火游园晚会。
    看河灯，是北京市民的固有习惯，过去每逢农历7月15日，北海公园照例要放河灯，今年原订在29日、30日连续举行两次，29日夜因下雨暂停，延期至9月2日继续举行。
    参加昨夜游园会的市民有三万人，据说这是解放后规模最大的一次放河灯。入夜后，北海公园灯光辉煌，如同白昼，五千盏明亮的五彩河灯，随风飘荡在海中，如同空中的灿烂星群。北京市花炮生产合作社特做的焰火有十五种，其中有我们在“五一”节和国庆节日看到的美丽礼花，还有民族传统的各种古老焰火，花样新奇繁多，彩色绚烂，火树银花，划破夜空。
    当焰火和河灯相映成辉时，在海中心还有水上古典音乐伴奏。并有丰富多采的京剧、评剧、曲艺、皮影、电影、杂耍等文艺节目助兴。还有北京的象棋名手张德魁和杨长生的象棋表演赛。直到深夜，人们才尽欢而散。
