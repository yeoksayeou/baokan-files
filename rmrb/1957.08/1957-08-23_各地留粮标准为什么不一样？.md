Why are grain retention standards different in different regions?

Some readers have written to inquire: The grain retention standards published for some regions are over 400 or 500 jin, while in other regions, the grain retention standard for farmers is only 360 jin of unprocessed grain per person per year, or even less than 360 jin. Why are the national grain ration standards for farmers different? Here is what we know in response:

The situation of different grain retention standards for farmers across the country exists not only between provinces, but also within certain provinces, between different regions. The reasons for this situation are that the amount of land and population, the varieties and yields of grain crops and harvest seasons, the impact of natural disasters on grain production, the labor conditions of farmers, the level of grain consumption in the past, and living habits are all different in different regions. In many regions, there have been differences in farmers' grain consumption historically. The grain retention standards set in 1955 were based on the general consumption level at that time, so the grain retention standards between provinces and even between counties within a province cannot be exactly the same. Take Hebei Province, for example. The population is relatively large, and the proportion of land used by farmers to grow cash crops is also relatively large. In addition, it has suffered from severe natural disasters for years. Therefore, the grain produced by farmers in the province each year is not enough for the entire province to eat, and the level of grain consumption has been relatively low historically and habitually. In recent years, production has developed and the grain consumption of farmers has improved to some extent; however, due to the limitations of low production levels and rapid population growth, it is still difficult to increase the current grain retention standard of 360 jin per person per year by much. The state has to transfer billions of jin of grain to Hebei Province from other grain-surplus areas every year to supply the needs of grain-deficient people. According to statistics, from July of last year to the end of June this year, the state transferred 4.23 billion jin of unprocessed grain from 24 provinces to Hebei Province, which accounts for 25.6% of the total grain output of Hebei Province. If the grain retention standard for farmers throughout the province is raised a little higher than the current 360 jin to align with the grain retention standards of other regions, then the state would need to increase the amount of grain transferred. Doing so, under the current situation of very low grain production levels in China and tight grain supplies for farmers in various regions, may affect the grain consumption needs of farmers in other regions, which is obviously difficult for the state to do.

Furthermore, the varieties of grain produced in different regions are also different. Some grain varieties have a relatively high conversion rate into finished grain (such as wheat, miscellaneous grains, and beans); while other grain varieties have a relatively low conversion rate into finished grain (such as rice). Therefore, the grain retention standards for farmers cannot be the same in different grain-producing areas. For example, Anhui Province stipulates that in areas producing rice, the grain retention standard per person per year is 450 to 490 jin of unprocessed grain; in areas mainly producing miscellaneous grains, it is 360 to 410 jin per person per year (if the unprocessed grain is converted into finished grain, it is only about 310 to 350 jin, which is not much different from the grain retention standard in Hebei Province).

It can be seen from this that it is practical for the state to formulate different grain retention standards according to the specific conditions of each region and in accordance with local conditions.

It should be explained that the grain retention standard stipulated by the state is only the minimum guarantee for the grain consumption level of farmers (except in the case of particularly severe disasters), and not the maximum limit for farmers' grain consumption. As long as farmers actively produce and increase grain production, the state will purchase 40% of the increased production, while the remaining 60% will be left for farmers to handle freely. In recent years, in many regions and agricultural cooperatives that have increased grain production (including Hebei Province), the actual amount of grain retained by farmers has exceeded the grain retention standard stipulated by the state. For example, when Hubei Province implemented the "three fixings" for grain in 1955, it stipulated that the grain retention standard per person per year was 530 jin (including seeds and livestock feed, the same below); last year, the province achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, increasing grain production by about 2.5 billion jin. Therefore, the actual amount of grain possessed per person per year reached more than 710 jin, which is more than 180 jin more than the grain retention standard. This fully demonstrates that in the future, with the gradual development of grain production in China, farmers will obtain more grain to improve their lives and develop production. From the perspective of farmers, they should also recognize that the improvement of grain consumption can only be based on the development and increase of grain production. Under the current situation where China's grain situation is not yet abundant, the state has already carried out many arduous tasks to ensure the basic food needs of farmers across the country and to avoid affecting farmers' production and life. If we unrealistically demand that the state universally raise the current grain retention standard and level it across the country, it is inappropriate and impossible to achieve.

### 各地留粮标准为什么不一样？

专栏：答读者问

　　各地留粮标准为什么不一样？
    一些读者来信询问：报上登载的有些地区的留粮标准是四百多斤、五百多斤，另有一些地区的农民，每人每年留粮标准却只有原粮三百六十斤，甚至不到三百六十斤，何以全国农民的粮食定量标准不一样呢？现就我们知道的一些情况，解答如下：
    全国各地农民留粮标准不一样的情形，不仅在省与省之间存在，就是在某些省内，地区与地区之间，也是存在的。产生这种情形的原因，是各地土地和人口多少、粮食作物品种产量和收获季节、自然灾害对粮食生产的影响、农民的劳动状况、以往用粮的水平以及生活习惯等等，都各不相同。许多地区，农民的用粮情况，在历史上就有差别。1955年所定的留粮标准是以当时一般的消费水平为根据的，所以省与省间乃至一省之内县与县间的留粮标准不能完全相同。拿河北省来说，人口比较多，农民种植经济作物的土地面积所占比例也较大，加以连年遭受严重的自然灾害，因此，全省农民每年生产的粮食，就不够全省人吃，粮食消费水平在历史上、在习惯上就比较低些。几年来，生产发展了，农民的粮食消费状况，有了一些改善；但终因生产水平低的限制，加以人口增殖很快，目前每人每年的留粮标准，仍难提高很多。国家每年要从其他余粮地区，调给河北省几十亿斤粮食，供应缺粮人民的需要。据统计，由去年7月到今年6月底止，国家从二十四个省调入河北省的原粮，就有四十二点三亿斤，这个数字，占河北全省粮食产量的25.6％。如果把全省农民的留粮标准，比现在规定的三百六十斤再提高一点，与其他地区的留粮标准拉平，那就需要国家再增加调入粮食。这样做，在目前我国粮食生产水平很低、各地农民用粮都很不宽裕的情况下，就可能影响到其他地区农民的吃粮需要，显然国家是难以做到的。
    再者，各地所产粮食的品种也不同。有些粮种，折合成品粮的数量比较高（如小麦、杂粮、豆类）；有些粮种折合成品粮的数量就比较低一些（如稻谷）。因此，农民的留粮标准，在不同产粮区，也不可能一样。例如安徽省规定：生产稻谷的地区，每人每年留粮标准为原粮四百五十至四百九十斤；生产杂粮为主的地区，每人每年三百六十——四百一十斤（如将原粮折为成品粮计算，亦只有三百一十——三百五十斤左右，与河北省的留粮标准相比，并无很大差别）。
    由此可见，国家根据各地具体情况，因地制宜，规定出不同的留粮标准，是切合实际的。
    应该说明：国家规定的留粮标准，只是农民粮食消费水平的最低保证（特大灾荒除外），而不是农民用粮的最高限额。只要农民积极生产，增产了粮食，国家除了增购增产部分的40％以外，其余60％都留给农民自己自由处理。近几年来，许多增产了粮食的地区和农业社（包括河北省），农民的实际留粮数量，都已超过了国家规定的留粮标准。如湖北省1955年实行粮食“三定”的时候，规定每人每年留粮标准为五百三十斤（包括种籽，牲畜饲料，下同）；去年全省获得了空前大丰收，增产粮食约二十五亿斤，因此，每人每年实际占有粮食达到七百一十多斤，比留粮标准多占有一百八十多斤。这就充分说明：今后随着我国粮食生产的逐步发展，农民将会得到更多的粮食，用以改善生活，发展生产。从农民来说，也应该认识：粮食消费状况的改善，只能建立在粮食生产发展和增产的基础上。在目前我国粮食状况还不宽裕的情况下，国家为了保证全国农民对基本口粮的需要，为了不影响农民的生产和生活，已经进行了许多艰苦的工作；如果再脱离实际地要求国家普遍提高目前的留粮标准，在全国范围内拉平，那是不应该的，也是不可能做得到的。
