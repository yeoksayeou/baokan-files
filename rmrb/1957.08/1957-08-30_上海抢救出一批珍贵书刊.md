Xinhua News Agency Dispatch:

    Shanghai has rescued and sorted out a batch of precious foreign-language books and periodicals that record the social, political, economic, and cultural aspects of the period around the October Socialist Revolution, a collection rarely seen in China.

    This batch of books and periodicals totals more than 70,000 volumes, including publications in Russian, Polish, English, French, and German from the late 18th century to the early 20th century. Among the more than 30,000 volumes that have been preliminarily sorted, many historical materials are found that record the three revolutions of great historical significance of the Soviet Communist Party—the bourgeois democratic revolution of 1905, the February Revolution of 1917, and the October Socialist Revolution; military operation maps and pictorials of the Russian army participating in World War I and the Russo-Japanese War; and historical materials that elaborate on the development of Russian capitalism and reflect the economic and cultural exchanges between China and Russia. Of particular importance are many revolutionary literature materials reflecting the fierce political struggle between the Bolshevik Party and anti-Leninist groups such as anarchists, Socialist-Revolutionaries, and Mensheviks on the eve of the October Revolution. In addition, there are various literary books with extremely exquisite cover designs and beautiful illustrations.

    This batch of books and periodicals is the collection of more than 40 old Russian private libraries in Siberia, Warsaw, and Northeast and North China, which have been transferred to Shanghai year by year. The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture has allocated this batch of books to the Shanghai Library, and the more than 30,000 volumes that have been preliminarily sorted will be available for readers to consult in advance.

    上海抢救出一批珍贵书刊
    国内罕见的一批记载十月社会主义革命前后社会政治经济和文化方面情况的外文书刊，现在已经由上海市文化局抢救整理出来。
    这批书刊共七万多册，包括俄文、波兰文、英文、法文、德文等五国文字，是十八世纪后期到二十世纪初期的出版物。从目前初步清理出来的三万多册书刊中，发现有不少记载苏联共产党具有伟大历史意义的三次革命——1905年资产阶级民主革命、1917年2月革命和十月社会主义革命的史料；俄军参加第一次世界大战和日俄战争的军事作战地图和画报，以及阐述俄国资本主义发展和体现中俄两国经济、文化交流的史料。其中值得特别重视的是许多反映十月革命前夜，布尔什维克党和无政府主义者、社会革命党人、孟什维克等反列宁主义集团展开激烈政治斗争的革命文献资料。此外，还有各种封面装帧极为精致并附优美插图的文艺书籍。
    这批书刊是逐年辗转流入上海的西伯利亚、华沙以及我国东北、华北等地四十多个旧俄私人图书馆的藏书。上海市文化局已将这批图书拨交上海图书馆，其中初步清理出来的三万多册将提前供来馆读者参阅。　（新华社讯）
