    Grand Ball
    Our Moscow dispatch, August 4th. The solemn Kremlin transformed into a beautiful ballroom on the evening of August 3rd. The scale of the ball was considerable: 15,000 young people from five continents participated. Soviet youth also hold balls in the Kremlin's halls every New Year. Obviously, even opening all the halls would not be enough to accommodate so many dancers, so the ball was moved outdoors. Searchlights shone brightly, and microphones broadcast cheerful music. Trumpeters blew their horns on the towers. Colorful fireworks soared into the sky. Couples of young men and women danced waltzes and other dances joyfully on the cobblestone square.

    盛大的舞会
    本报莫斯科4日电  庄严的克里姆林宫，8月3日晚上变成了美丽的舞会场。舞会规模大的可观：五大洲青年一万五千人参加了舞会。苏联青年每逢新年也在克里姆林宫大厅内举行舞会。显然，所有大厅都打开来也容纳不下这么多的舞客，所以舞会改在露天举行了。探照灯射出强烈的光芒，麦克风播送着愉快的音乐。号手们在塔楼上吹着号角。五颜六色的焰火飞向天空。一对对青年男女，在小石块铺的广场上狂欢地跳起华尔兹和别的舞。
