Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 13th - Cadres at all levels of leadership organs and departments in Hebei Province are implementing the policy of rectifying while correcting, and are actively improving their work.

According to preliminary statistics from the organs and factories and enterprises in Shijiazhuang, Tangshan, and Chengde, the masses have put forward a total of 1,200 criticisms and suggestions, of which more than 800 have been dealt with.

All levels of leadership organs have first improved the work that is directly related to the broad masses, and have established new working systems. In the past, when the Provincial Department of Agriculture inspected work, they mostly went to areas with convenient transportation and a good work foundation. After criticism from cadres, nearly 300 cadres were organized to go to marginal areas for investigation and research during the summer harvest and summer planting this time. The Minister and section chiefs of the Rural Work Department of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China also led three work groups to go deep into the townships and cooperatives to understand the problems in the grain work and the problems existing in the agricultural cooperatives. When the members of the Tangshan Prefectural Committee and the Changli County Committee of the Communist Party of China were helping the Changli Chengguan Vegetable Production Cooperative with production, they found that the prices of agricultural tools such as large hoes and shovels produced by handicraft cooperatives were too high. After recalculating the costs with five baking furnace cooperatives, the prices of 63 products were reduced by an average of 17.9%. Twenty units, including the Shijiazhuang Municipal People's Committee, have designated special personnel to be responsible for handling letters and visits from the masses.

The welfare issues of the broad masses of workers and staff, such as staff dormitories, living allowances, promotions, etc., in various organs and factories and enterprise units, have also absorbed the opinions of the masses and made appropriate adjustments and treatments.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 13th - Since the rectification campaign, the work style of leaders in many units in Jiangxi Province has changed, and their work has become more in-depth. The Vice President of the Provincial Higher People's Court recently led a work group to the People's Courts in Yichun, Fenyi, Fengcheng and other counties to conduct an in-depth inspection of many civil and criminal cases that have been tried and concluded, and to help and improve the policy level of lower-level trial personnel through inspection. Within the organs, research institutions have also been improved, specializing in handling work reports and requests for instructions from lower-level courts, changing the past phenomenon of not being able to deal with reports and requests for instructions from below in a timely manner. Several directors of the Department of Commerce now often go to various directly affiliated companies to inspect work and understand the situation. The four managers of the Shangrao Department Store spend half a day each week going to the warehouse to sort out and tidy up with the workers and staff, and have now sold out the goods that have been overstocked for more than a year.

In the past, patients in Nanchang City mostly concentrated in several provincial and municipal hospitals for medical treatment, so it was very crowded and inconvenient, while the business of grass-roots health centers and integrated Chinese medicine clinics was relatively light. Recently, after research by the Nanchang Municipal Health Bureau and relevant units, all grass-roots health centers and integrated Chinese medicine clinics have signed medical contracts with nearby factories, construction sites, enterprises, and handicraft cooperatives, and some units that originally signed medical contracts with provincial and municipal hospitals have also transferred them to these grass-roots medical units. Now, when the workers and staff of these units need to see a doctor, they no longer go to large hospitals to crowd, and they can register at any time and see a doctor on the same day, which they are all very satisfied with.

    首先改进同广大群众有密切关系的工作
    河北江西许多领导干部工作更深入了
    新华社保定13日电　河北省各级领导机关、部门贯彻执行边整边改的方针，积极改进工作。
    据石家庄、唐山、承德三市各机关和厂矿企业单位的初步统计，群众提出的批评和建议共一千二百件，已经处理的有八百多件。
    各级领导机关首先改进了同广大群众有直接关系的工作，并且建立起新的工作制度。省农业厅过去检查工作时，多半到交通条件方便、工作基础较好的地区去检查。经干部提出批评后，这次夏收夏种期间就组织近三百名干部到边沿地区进行调查研究。中共河北省委农村工作部部长、处长也率领三个工作组深入到乡和社，了解粮食工作中的问题和农业社存在的问题。中共唐山地委和昌黎县委委员们，在帮助昌黎城关蔬菜生产合作社生产时，发现手工业社生产的大镐、锄等农具价格过高。经过和五个烘炉社重新计算成本后，把六十三种产品的价格平均下调了17.9％。石家庄市人民委员会等二十个单位都确定专人负责处理群众来信来访工作。
    各地机关和厂矿企业单位对广大职工的福利问题如职工宿舍、生活补助，提职提级等问题，也吸取群众的意见，作了适当的调整和处理。
    据新华社南昌13日电　整风以来，江西省许多单位的领导作风已转变，工作更加深入。省高级人民法院副院长最近带领了工作组到宜春、分宜、丰城等县人民法院，深入检查很多已经审判结案的民、刑事案件，通过检查来帮助、提高下级审判人员的政策水平。在机关内部，也健全了研究机构，专门负责处理下级法院的工作报告、请示等材料，改变了过去对下面的报告和请示处理不及时的现象。商业厅的几个厅长，现在已经常到各直属公司检查工作，了解情况。上饶百货公司的四个经理每周以半天时间到仓库和职工一起清点整理，现在已把积压了一年多的商品销售出去了。
    南昌市过去病人看病多集中在几个省、市立医院，因此很拥挤、不方便，而基层卫生所和中医联合诊所的业务却又比较轻闲。最近经南昌市卫生局和有关单位研究以后，各基层卫生所和中医联合诊所都同附近的工厂、工地、企业和工艺合作社签订了医疗合同，一些原来同省、市医院签订医疗合同的单位也转交了这些基层医疗单位。现在，这些单位的职工要看病时已不再到大医院去拥挤，随时可以挂号，当日就诊，他们都很满意。
