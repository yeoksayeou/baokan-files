Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 24th. (Xinhua News Agency reporter Yu Huiyin reports): Peng Wenying, the principal member of the Zhang-Luo alliance in Shanghai and deputy chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, struck a "challenge" pose at the ongoing Shanghai Municipal People's Congress, clamoring to engage in a grand debate with the people's representatives. The result of this "grand debate," however, was that he was refuted into speechlessness, his reactionary features exposed even more clearly.

After the struggle against the bourgeois rightists began, Peng Wenying and his small clique agreed on three brilliant strategies to resist the movement: first, not to speak; second, to speak a little; and third, to have a grand debate. Over the past three months, the Shanghai Democratic League Municipal Committee Rectification Leadership Group held sixteen meetings of various sizes for Peng Wenying. Although he himself consistently remained silent or only spoke a little, his ugly features were fully exposed through everyone's comprehensive exposure and criticism. However, Peng Wenying stubbornly resisted, believing that he could not lose the grand debate.

Peng Wenying had ample opportunity to fully expound his views at this Shanghai Municipal People's Congress. During the debate, this cunning rightist denied a series of his anti-communist and anti-socialist remarks and actions during the period of "great blooming and contending," avoiding those he couldn't deny. In one of his speeches, which lasted two and a half hours, he repeatedly claimed to "support the Communist Party and socialism," and that his intention "was to help the Party improve its work." On the other hand, he trotted out a whole set of bourgeois fallacies on eleven issues, including the socialist economic system, socialist democracy, the leadership of the Party, the role of democratic parties, and cadre policy, continuing to attack the Communist Party.

	What Kind of Democracy Does He Worship?

Peng Wenying, with his status as a student who studied in the United States and had a "specialized study of political science," tirelessly spouted a set of fallacies on the issue of democracy, saying that "under the socialist system, there should be more democracy than in capitalism, but our country lacks experience, and the People's Congress and the CPPCC have insufficient democracy," and that "capitalist countries' parliaments have the right to question, which we don't, and we can absorb this." Hu Qi'an, associate professor of Fudan University, and others immediately pointed out that socialist democracy and bourgeois democracy are completely different things, and there is absolutely no difference merely in degree. Hu Qi'an cited various specific materials, such as the composition of members of parliaments in the United States and Britain, to show that parliaments in capitalist countries are only organizations representing a small group of monopoly capitalists. He said that as for the right to question, not to mention that the so-called right to question in capitalist countries' parliaments is a fraud in itself, the fact is that the people's representatives in our country have the right to question, which is clearly stipulated in Article 34 of the National People's Congress Organizational Law. Hu Qi'an read out this article on the spot.

Jiang Xuemo, associate professor of Fudan University, asked Peng Wenying whether he favored capitalist democracy or socialist democracy. Peng Wenying hypocritically said that he "can unhesitatingly" say that he "completely supports socialist democracy and absolutely does not support bourgeois democracy." Jiang Xuemo and others then exposed some of the things Peng Wenying had said at the end of March this year: "Democratic centralism makes people feel that democracy is restricted under the leadership of the Communist Party," "Now, internal problems among the people should not use great democracy but small democracy, which gives people the illusion that the framework of democracy is getting smaller and smaller." "The definition of bourgeois democracy should be that the regime is established on the basis of the people, while the Soviet Union and China belong to socialist democracy, so it is more appropriate to call it organized democracy." Jiang Xuemo questioned Peng Wenying: "Where do these words of yours support socialist democracy? They are completely slandering socialist democracy!" Wu Changming, a representative attending the meeting, then cited a set of even more blatant remarks Peng Wenying made at the CPPCC last year: "The Communist Party is even more powerful than the Kuomintang, creating a serious atmosphere of fearful silence among the masses, so the mentality of being a guest and speaking by looking at faces has emerged. If this continues, the result will be like when the Hungarian Communist Party put down its guns, and people will swarm up." At this time, the representatives questioned Peng Wenying why he slandered socialist democracy and beautified bourgeois democracy in this way.

Unable to deny the irrefutable facts, Peng Wenying admitted that he "exaggerated and beautified bourgeois democracy."

	What Role Did He Want the Democratic League to Play?

On the issue of the role of democratic parties, Peng Wenying said that he wanted to make the democratic parties play a greater role as assistants. He also said that this role has three aspects: unity and education, a bridging role, and mutual supervision. In answering the question of what the role of unity and education is, he said, "Naturally, it is to educate members to support the Party and socialism and to be loyal assistants of the Party."

Zong Weihui, a member of the Democratic League, immediately stood up and exposed him, saying: "You can see what kind of people you are uniting from the people you introduced into the League. Of the thirty people you introduced, three did not pass membership: one was a fugitive landlord; one had an unclear political background; and one was a grafter in the Three-Anti campaign. Of the two who were expelled from the League: one was a Central Statistics Bureau secret agent; and one was a local tyrant landlord. Among the twenty-five who are currently retained in the League, there are five rightists and many people who are dissatisfied with the Communist Party. How can such people support the Communist Party and support socialism! What is the purpose of you developing them?"

Tang Jiajie, a cadre of the Democratic League, also questioned Peng Wenying: Because some people from democratic parties actively participate in various political movements, he scolded the democratic parties as "hitmen" and "busy bodies." Is this standing in the position of an assistant to the Communist Party?

The representatives also exposed the fact that Peng Wenying used the opportunity of the people's representatives' inspection to set fires in state organs, factories, and other units, explaining that Peng Wenying's so-called "bridging role" was actually completely to sow discord. Peng Wenying's so-called "mutual supervision" and his fallacies at the beginning of this year, such as "one party in power, one party out of power, can compete with each other and supervise each other," actually meant to stand on an equal footing with the Communist Party, or even replace it.

	Isn't His Small Clique Anti-Communist?

On the most critical issue—the issue of the Zhang-Luo alliance's small clique in Shanghai—Peng Wenying adopted an attitude of flat denial and firm refusal to confess. He said that there was a small clique before 1952, but it did not oppose the Communist Party.

Chen Renbing, another principal member of this small clique, immediately exposed him, saying: "How can you say that our small clique is not anti-communist? The small clique often gathered to receive instructions from Luo Longji, discussing how to seize leadership, seize the League News (the Democratic League's organ publication), oppose the East China Executive Department of the Democratic League headquarters, which was implementing the correct line, and oppose the United Front Work Department. We wanted to oppose progressive elements within the League, even though many of them had not criticized us."

Peng Wenying, seeing that his old partner Chen Renbing had also stood up to expose him, was even more furious, making faces in the venue and adopting a rogue attitude. Everyone sternly criticized his attitude.

The representatives exposed that after 1952, Luo Longji came to Shanghai several times and summoned members of the small clique to hold meetings. During the "great blooming and contending," members of the small clique discussed how to divide the work and launch a frenzied attack on the Communist Party, discussed each other's speeches attacking the Communist Party, and jointly drafted Sun Dayu's list falsely accusing Communist Party members and progressive non-Party members of being counter-revolutionaries. After the anti-rightist struggle began, the small clique made a pact of mutual defense to resist confession. These facts all show that Peng Wenying's statement that "the small clique no longer exists" is a complete lie.

Peng Wenying also openly slandered our country's socialist economic system and praised the capitalist economic system, saying: "The planned economy is good, but it is not free. There are many benefits to planned supply, but you can't buy anything." "Under the socialist system, the quality of commodities is low, the specifications are uniform, and consumers have no right to choose, which is not as good as the power of capitalist consumers, such as the United States having customer comment books and a wide variety of goods." He took fountain pens as an example, saying that now fountain pens only come in black and are not distinguished by thickness. Hu Tiesheng, director of the Shanghai Municipal First Commercial Bureau, immediately brought four large boxes to Peng Wenying, proving that his words were groundless. Each of these four boxes contained more than twenty fountain pens, with different colors and styles. Hu Tiesheng said that before liberation, fountain pens only had eight specifications and twenty-seven varieties. Before the joint venture, the number increased to thirty-eight varieties, and now there are more than fifty varieties (some old specifications have been eliminated). In the past, many Chinese people used foreign pens, but now many foreign consumers love to use Chinese pens. Not only fountain pens, but also the varieties of various consumer goods such as floral cloth, rubber, enamelware, and handkerchiefs are constantly increasing, and the quality is constantly improving. You only see that the United States has customer comment books, but our general stores have customer comment books. Our commercial staff also go deep into the masses to understand the needs of consumers. Why can't you see this? Planned supply is to rationally distribute existing materials to ensure people's lives. The freedom for you to hoard goods for speculation and profiteering in the past is impossible today and will never be possible in the future.

	What Kind of Personnel System Did He Dream Of?

Peng Wenying also openly slandered the current cadre policy in the venue, saying that it was "using great talents for small tasks, using small talents for great tasks, using superior talents for inferior tasks, using inferior talents for superior tasks, using talents not for what they have studied, studying not for what they will use, using talents not for their strengths, using talents not for their wishes, having talent but no morality, having morality but no talent, having neither morality nor talent, having a position but no power, having no power but a position, having a position but no job, having a job but no position, having rewards but no punishments, having punishments but no rewards, and rewards and punishments being reversed." He also slandered that "New China has no freedom of the press, and newspapers are full of dry and dogmatic things, so now a university professor in China has less political knowledge than a landlady in the United States," and said that he would take "strikes of seeing, listening, speaking, writing, and thinking" to deal with the Party's propaganda and education, and other fallacies, which were all severely criticized by the representatives at the meeting.

The representatives also questioned Peng Wenying: You suggested that the Public Security Bureau release a large number of counter-revolutionaries, advocating that the old should be released, the young and strong should be released, the sick should be released, the technically skilled should be released, and senior intellectuals should be released. Who exactly do you still want to leave unreleased? Why are you so affectionate towards counter-revolutionaries?

Peng Wenying was refuted into silence at the meeting and admitted that the exposures by everyone were facts. But he insisted that his motives were good and that he was trying to help the Communist Party improve its work. His mistake was only that some of his remarks had problems in terms of wording, timing, occasion, and object, which objectively produced some bad effects, but he was definitely not anti-communist or anti-socialist. He also said that in the past, he talked less about the achievements, and asked to be given an opportunity to praise the fifteen aspects of the great achievements of New China at the People's Congress. Everyone immediately criticized his base two-faced tactics.

In order to show that he was not opposed to the Communist Party or socialism, Peng Wenying cited the titles of three articles he published in 1932 in the journal "Advocacy and Criticism," which was run by the rightist Wang Zaoshi, as proof. The titles of these three articles were: "The Road of Capitalism Is Impassable," "The Road of Communism Is Also Impassable," and "The Road of Socialism Is More Passable." Peng Wenying said triumphantly, "You see, haven't I been in favor of the socialist direction since 1932?"

Jiang Xuemo read out these self-bragging articles of Peng Wenying at the meeting. It turned out that in these articles, Peng Wenying attributed all the evils of the Kuomintang, such as "the separation of the KMT and the CCP and the interruption of the National Revolution," and even the Kuomintang's compromise with imperialism, to the communist movement, cursing the Communist Party for "killing, arson, and using bandits. The crimes of the Chinese Communist Party in these aspects cannot be forgiven by us!" "Communism opposes democratic politics and advocates class dictatorship." He also said absurdly that "the reluctant autocracy of the Chinese Kuomintang is already unbearable for the people. The serious autocracy of the Chinese Communist Party, wouldn't that be even more severe? In order to avoid this kind of oppression, the class to be oppressed must strike first and will unite and oppose it together, regardless of whether the interests are consistent or the views are the same, before the class dictatorship succeeds." The "socialist system," which Peng Wenying thought was more feasible, he believed should rely on "capitalists with vision, understanding of the big picture, and serving the country and the people" to achieve. This kind of socialism is "not just the ideology of one class." "Capitalists who enthusiastically support it are not overthrown, and private property enterprises can still be retained." He completely regarded the working class as a passive, benefactor-receiving class, saying, "After the implementation of socialism, all resistance disputes on the labor side will naturally not be a problem."

The representatives criticized Peng Wenying, saying that these articles not only do not show that he is not currently anti-Party and anti-socialist, but also show that he is an old-brand rightist.

After all kinds of fallacies were refuted, Peng Wenying again played the role of a "lost lamb" at the meeting. The representatives rebuked him in unison, saying: "You are not a kind lamb; you are a wolf grandmother in sheep's clothing!"

    正义的声音粉碎了邪说歪道
　　上海人民代表舌战彭文应
　　一层层透彻的道理，一件件确切的事实
    把章罗联盟这个凶恶爪牙驳得理屈词穷
    新华社上海24日电　新华社记者余辉音报道：章罗联盟在上海的首要分子、民盟上海市委副主任委员彭文应，在正在举行的上海市人代会上摆出一副“打擂台”的姿态，叫嚣要和人民代表们开展大辩论。而大辩论的结果，却是他自己被驳得理屈词穷，反动面目欲盖弥彰。
    反对资产阶级右派分子的斗争开始后，彭文应就和他的小集团分子商妥了抗拒这一运动的三条锦囊妙计：一是不讲话；二是讲一点；三是大辩论。三个月来，上海民盟市委整风领导小组为彭文应开过大小会议十六次，尽管他自己始终是不讲或只讲一点，但经过大家全面的揭发和批判，他的丑恶面目还是完全暴露了。但是，彭文应仍然负隅顽抗，认为大辩论他输不了。
    彭文应在这次上海市人代会上完全有机会充分阐述自己的论点。这个狡猾的右派分子在辩论会上对自己在大鸣大放期间一系列的反共反社会主义言行百般抵赖，赖不掉的就避而不谈。在他的一次长达二小时半的发言中，一面口口声声说自己是“拥护共产党，拥护社会主义”的，他的用意“是为了帮助党改进工作”；另一方面却就社会主义经济制度、社会主义民主、党的领导、民主党派的作用、干部政策等十一个问题，搬出一整套的资产阶级谬论，继续向共产党进攻。
　　他崇拜的是什么民主？
    彭文应以留学美国、对“政治学有专门研究”的身分，对民主问题滔滔不绝地发表了一套谬论，说“社会主义制度下，应该比资本主义有更多的民主，可是我国经验不够，人代会政协会民主都不够”，“资本主义国家议会有质询权，我们没有，可以加以吸收”。在座的复旦大学副教授胡其安等立刻指出，社会主义民主和资产阶级民主完全是两回事，绝不只是程度上的差别。胡其安引用了美国、英国议员的成分等各种具体材料说明资本主义国家议会只是一小撮垄断资本家的代表的组织。他说，关于质询权，且不谈资本主义国家议会所谓质询权本身就是一个骗局，事实上我国人民代表是有质询权的，这在全国人民代表大会组织法第三十四条有明文规定。胡其安当场宣读了这项条文。
    复旦大学副教授蒋学模问彭文应究竟是赞成资本主义民主还是赞成社会主义民主？彭文应假惺惺地说，他“可以毫不犹豫地”说他“完全赞成社会主义民主，决不赞成资产阶级民主”。蒋学模等接着揭露了彭文应在今年3月底说过的一些话：“民主集中制使人有在共产党领导下民主受限制之感”，“现在人民内部问题不要运用大民主而要小民主，这就给人一种错觉，即民主的框框愈来愈小了”。“资产阶级民主的定义，应是政权建立在人民的基础上，而苏联和中国属于社会主义民主，因此称为有组织的民主较妥”。蒋学模责问彭文应：“你这些话那里是赞成社会主义民主，完全是污蔑社会主义民主！”列席代表吴常铭接着举出彭文应去年在政协会上发表的一套更为露骨的话：“共产党比国民党还要厉害，在群众中制造出一种像可怕的沉默那样严重的气氛，于是作客思想、看脸色讲话都来了。这样下去，结果就会像匈牙利共产党放下枪杆时候那样，人们就一窝蜂的起来了。”这时，代表们纷纷质问彭文应为什么要这样诋毁社会主义民主？这样美化资产阶级民主？
    彭文应在确凿的事实面前抵赖不掉，承认他是“夸大和美化了资产阶级民主”。
　　他想使民盟起什么作用？
    在民主党派作用的问题上，彭文应说，他是想使民主党派多发挥一些助手作用。他还说，这种作用有三方面，即团结教育、桥梁作用和互相监督。在答复关于什么是团结教育作用的时候，他说“自然是教育成员拥护党和社会主义，作党的忠实助手”。
    民盟成员宗惟惠立刻站起来揭露他说：“从你介绍入盟的人中可以看出你团结的是什么样的人。由你介绍的三十人中，未通过入盟的三人：一个是逃亡地主；一个政治面貌不清；一个是三反中的贪污犯。被开除盟籍的二人：一个是中统特务；一个是恶霸地主。现在保留盟籍的二十五人中，就有五个右派分子，还有不少对共产党不满的人。这样的人怎能拥护共产党，拥护社会主义！你发展他们的目的是什么？”
    民盟干部汤家杰也质问彭文应：因为一些民主党派人士积极参加各项政治运动，他就骂民主党派是“打手”、“包打听”，这难道是站在共产党的助手的立场吗？
    代表们又揭露出彭文应利用人民代表视察机会，到国家机关、工厂等单位放火等事实，说明彭文应的所谓“桥梁作用”实际上完全是挑拨离间；彭文应所说的“相互监督”，以及他在今年年初说的“一党在朝，一党在野，可以互相竞争，相互监督”等谬论，实际上是要与共产党分庭抗礼，甚至取而代之。
　　他的小集团不是反共的吗？
    在最关键的问题——章罗联盟在上海的小集团的问题上，彭文应采取矢口否认、坚决不肯交代的态度。他说，小集团在1952年以前是有的，但并没有反对共产党。
    这个小集团的另一首要分子陈仁炳当即揭露他说：“怎么能说我们这个小集团不是反共的呢？小集团经常集会，接受罗隆基的指示，商量如何抓领导权，抓盟讯（民盟机关刊物），反对执行正确路线的民盟总部华东执行部，反对统战部。对盟内的进步分子，尽管其中有好些人并没有批评过我们，我们也要反对。”
    彭文应看到他的老伙伴陈仁炳也起来揭露他，更是怒不可遏，在会场上挤眉歪嘴摆出一股无赖相。大家严肃地指斥了他的这种态度。
    代表们揭露，1952年以后罗隆基数次到上海，都召集小集团的成员开会。大“鸣”大“放”期间，小集团分子商量如何分工对共产党发动猖狂进攻，商量彼此向共产党进攻的发言稿，并共同拟定孙大雨的诬指共产党员和党外进步人士为反革命分子的名单。反右派斗争开始后，小集团又订立攻守同盟，抗拒交代。这些事实都说明彭文应说的“小集团已不存在”完全是撒谎。
    彭文应又公然污蔑我国社会主义经济制度，赞扬资本主义经济制度说：“计划经济好，就是不自由，计划供应好处是不少，就是买不到东西”、“在社会主义制度下，商品质量低劣，规格一律，消费者没有选购权，不如资本主义消费者权力大，如美国有顾客意见簿，商品花色品种多”。他并以自来水笔为例，说现在的自来水笔只有黑色的一种，而且粗细不分。上海市第一商业局局长胡铁生当场拿出四个大盒送到彭文应面前，证明他的话是无中生有。这四大盒各有自来水笔二十多支，花色式样各不相同。胡铁生说，解放前自来水笔只有八种规格，二十七种品种，合营前增加到三十八种品种，现在有五十多种（部分老式规格已经剔除）。过去很多中国人用外国笔，现在很多外国消费者爱用中国笔。不仅是自来水笔，花布、橡胶、搪瓷、手帕等各种消费品的品种都在不断增加，质量不断提高。你只看到美国有顾客意见簿，我们的一般商店都有顾客意见簿，我们商业工作人员还深入群众了解消费者的需要，你为什么就看不到？计划供应是将已有物资进行合理的分配，以保障人民生活。像你过去囤积居奇、投机倒把的自由，今天是不可能有，将来也决不会有的。
　　他梦想什么人事制度？
    彭文应还在会场上公然污蔑现在的干部政策是“大材小用、小材大用、优材劣用、劣材优用、用非所学、学非所用、用非所长、用非所愿、有才无德、有德无才、德才俱无、有职无权、无权有职、有职无业、有业无职、有赏无罚、有罚无赏、赏罚颠倒”，污蔑“新中国没有新闻自由，报纸上全是枯燥和教条的东西，因此现在中国一个大学教授的政治知识还不如美国的一个房东太太”，并说出“要采取罢看、罢听、罢说、罢写、罢思”来对付党的宣传教育等种种谬论，代表们在会上逐一予以痛斥。
    代表们还质问彭文应：你建议公安局释放大批反革命分子，主张年老的要放，年青力壮的要放，有病的要放，有技术的要放，高级知识分子要放。你究竟还要留下什么人不放？你为什么对反革命分子这样有感情？
    彭文应在会上被驳得哑口无言，承认大家揭露的都是事实。但他一口咬住他的动机是好的，是为了帮助共产党改进工作。而他的错误只是有些话的提法、时间、场合、对象有问题，以致客观上起了一些不好的作用，决不是反共反社会主义。他还说，过去他对成绩部分谈得少，请给他一个机会在人代会上歌颂一下新中国的十五个方面的伟大成就。大家立刻指斥了他这种卑鄙的两面派手法。
    为了说明自己不是反对共产党、反对社会主义，彭文应举出1932年他从美国留学回国后在右派分子王造时主办的刊物“主张与批评”上发表的三篇文章的题目为证。这三篇文章的题目是：“资本主义之路不通”、“共产主义之路也不通”、“社会主义之路比较可通”。彭文应得意洋洋地说，你们看，我不是从1932年就已赞成社会主义方向了吗？
    蒋学模在会上宣读了彭文应自吹自擂的这几篇文章。原来彭文应在这些文章里把“国共分家与国民革命的中断”以至于国民党与帝国主义妥协等国民党的一切罪恶，都归之于共产主义运动，咒骂共产党“杀人、放火，利用土匪，中国共产党在这些方面的罪行，是不能得到我们的饶恕的！”“共产主义是反对民主政治，而主张阶级独裁。”他还荒谬地说，“中国国民党勉强的专制，人民已经受不了，中国共产党认真的专制，那岂不更要厉害。为避免这种压迫起见，将要被压迫的阶级，在那时，一定是先下手，并且会不管利益是否一致，主张是否相同，不等阶级专制成功，便已起来联盟共同反对。”彭文应认为比较可行的“社会主义制度”，在他看来是要依靠“有眼光、明大义、为国为民的资本家”来实现的。这种社会主义“不只是一个阶级的主义”，“对热心赞助的资本家并不打倒，私有财产企业仍可保留”。他把工人阶级完全作为被动的受恩赐的阶级，说“实行社会主义之后，劳工方面一切的反抗纠纷便自然而然的不成问题了”。
    代表们指斥彭文应说，这些文章不但不能说明他现在没有反党反社会主义，反而说明他是一个老牌的右派分子。
    种种谬论被驳倒以后，彭文应又在会上把自己扮成“迷途的羔羊”，代表们同声驳斥他说：“你那里是善良的羔羊，你是一个披着羊皮的狼外婆！”
