Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 16th. Why is the relocation of Jiaotong University facing so many obstacles? After several weeks of anti-rightist struggle, the faculty and students of Jiaotong University have found the crux of the problem: the reactionary clique headed by rightist Shen Sanduo, professor of the Department of Electrical Engineering, seized the opportunity to stir up trouble.

    As soon as the news of Jiaotong University's relocation was revealed, Shen Sanduo said, "The relocation issue will change in the future." Then he gathered some people who firmly opposed the relocation to form a reactionary clique, spreading rumors and sowing discord everywhere, saying that "the central ministries are not concerned about the relocation of Jiaotong University," it was just Principal Peng "going his own way."

    Shen Sanduo attended the State Council meeting in Beijing on the relocation of Jiaotong University. After returning to the school, he attacked those who supported the full relocation to Xi'an as reading the "Bible" and being "superstitious." He also incited people by saying: "Premier Zhou is a politician, with a political point of view; we are engaged in education, with an educational point of view, and we don't agree."

    At one meeting, as soon as Chen Daxie, the Dean of Studies, made a speech advocating relocation, Shen Sanduo flew into a rage and shouted, "Dean Chen revealed the intentions of the leadership. Now the key to the relocation issue lies with the leadership and the Ministry of Higher Education. Our discussion is a waste." He shouted repeatedly, "I've made a fool of myself." At several enlarged meetings of the school committee, he more aggressively forced Principal Peng Kang to immediately make a resolution not to relocate the university, and threatened, "If you don't make a resolution, you must say a sentence in the concluding remarks, that is, no one in the three days of meetings agreed to the relocation."

    When the relocation issue was delayed and could not be resolved due to their obstruction, the rightist Shen Sanduo and others thought that the Ministry of Higher Education and the school had been made "flustered and exasperated" and "unable to back down," so he gloated and clamored: "We don't want small democracy, but big democracy."

    After the anti-rightist struggle was launched, everyone saw through his conspiracy, his small group disintegrated, and it was revealed that Shen Sanduo had told members of his small group that he had planned to speak at a school committee meeting to disrupt the school's group discussion of the relocation issue. At one meeting, Shen Sanduo applauded the opinions against relocation, trying to create a unanimous opposition to relocation in order to undermine the principal. Many people also revealed Shen Sanduo's consistent anti-communist and anti-socialist words and deeds. Shen Sanduo once said, "Socialism is an old pot, very inefficient." He pointed to some small chimneys outside Jiaotong University and said, "Taking a picture of this is Chinese industrialization."

    At the same time as Shen Sanduo's opposition to the relocation, rightist Yuan Yiqun, member of the Jiusan Society and professor of the Department of Power Machinery, and communist rightists Pan Zhencang and Yang Weimin, etc., also used opposition to the relocation as a cover to echo Shen Sanduo's anti-communist clique. Yuan Yiqun used his position as chairman of the trade union department committee of the Department of Power Machinery to secretly convene meetings against the relocation, and actively brought people who did not agree with the relocation into the Jiusan Society to strengthen their momentum. Yuan Yiqun also clamored: "Jiaotong University relocating to Xi'an is like lighting gunpowder, it will explode at any time."

    Currently, the faculty and students of Jiaotong University are continuing to expose and fight against these rightists.

### 交通大学迁校问题为何阻碍重重？  原来是沈三多集团从中捣乱

    交通大学迁校问题为何阻碍重重？
    原来是沈三多集团从中捣乱
    新华社上海16日电  交通大学迁校问题为什么这样阻碍重重？经过几十天的反右派斗争后，交大广大师生找到了问题的症结所在，这就是以右派分子、电机系教授沈三多为首的反动小集团趁机兴风作浪的结果。
    交大迁校的事刚露风声，沈三多就说：“迁校问题将来要变。”接着他就拉拢一些坚决反对迁校的人结成反动小集团，到处造谣、挑拨，说什么“中央各部对交通大学迁校并不关心”，只是彭校长“一意孤行”。
    沈三多在北京参加了国务院召开关于交大迁校问题的会议，回到学校后就攻击赞成全迁西安的人是读“圣经”，是“迷信”；又煽惑说：“周总理是政治家，政治观点；我们是搞教育的，教育观点，合不来。”
    在一次会上，学校教务长陈大燮主张迁校的发言刚提出，沈三多即暴跳如雷，大叫“陈教务长透露了领导意图，现在迁校问题关键在于领导和高教部。我们讨论是白废。”他连声叫喊：“我做了傻瓜”。在几次校委扩大会上，他更气势汹汹地威逼校长彭康，要他立即作出不迁校的决议，并要挟说：“如果不作决议，也必须在结束语里说一句话，就是三天来的会议没有一个人同意迁校。”
    当迁校问题被他们多方阻碍迟迟不能解决的时候，右派分子沈三多等便以为高等教育部和学校已经被搞得“焦头烂额”、“骑虎难下”了，于是他又幸灾乐祸地叫嚷：“我们不会要小民主，而要大民主。”
    反右派斗争开展后大家识破了他的阴谋，他的小集团瓦解了，并揭露出：沈三多曾告诉他的小集团的分子，他曾有计划地在一次校委会上发言，准备打乱学校分组讨论迁校问题的步骤。在某次会议上，沈三多为反迁校的意见鼓掌，是企图造成一边倒来反对迁校，来拆校长的台。许多人还揭发出沈三多一贯反共反社会主义的言行，沈三多曾说，“社会主义是一只老爷锅炉，效率很低。”他曾指着交通大学外面一些小烟囱说：“把这个拍一张照片下来的话，就是中国工业化。”
    和沈三多反对迁校的活动同时，右派分子、九三学社成员、动力机械系教授袁轶群与共产党内右派分子潘震苍、杨为民等也以反对迁校为幌子，与沈三多反共小集团互相呼应。袁轶群利用他动力机械系工会部门委员会主席的职权，暗自召开反对迁校的会议，并积极把不赞成迁校的人拉入九三学社，以壮大声势。袁轶群还叫嚣说：“交大迁西安，犹如点火药，随时都会爆炸。”
    现在，交通大学师生对这些右派分子，仍在继续揭发和斗争中。
