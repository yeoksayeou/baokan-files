Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 10th: A Xinhua News Agency reporter commented on the anti-Rightist struggle situation of the democratic parties in the Wuhan area, saying: Most of the Rightist elements hidden in the democratic parties' organizations in the Wuhan area have fully revealed their ugly features and are besieged on all sides. Some democratic party organizations, after the anti-Rightist struggle, have begun to reverse their erroneous political direction.

During the period of Great Blooming and Contending, Rightist elements hidden within the democratic parties' organizations in the Wuhan area launched frenzied attacks on the Party in various aspects. Among them, the anti-Party and anti-socialist activities of the Rightist clique headed by Ma Zemin, Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League and Chairman of Hubei Province and Wuhan City, with Vice-Chairman Dai Jinsheng and Secretary-General Xiang Cuian participating, the Rightist clique of Wang Yiming, member of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association, the Geng Bozhao clique, member of the Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, as well as Yan Xunfu, Chairman of the Municipal Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, and Cheng Qianfan, member of the Jiusan Society and professor at Wuhan University, were the most vicious.

The Ma Zemin Rightist clique of the China Democratic League once turned the provincial and municipal organizations of the League into a base for implementing the instructions of the Zhang-Luo alliance to attack the Party and socialism, becoming the dominant anti-Party force in the Wuhan area. The Geng Bozhao reactionary clique clamored against the Communist Party's "great-party-ism" and attempted to seize leadership from the Party. Wang Yiming vigorously peddled Zhang Naiqi's private goods, while Cheng Qianfan masterminded the publication of a "Joint Declaration of Democratic Parties," encouraging students to "fight for freedom, democracy, and human rights" from the Party. It has now been verified that all the places where the attacks on the Party were the fiercest during the Great Blooming and Contending period were related to the criminal activities of these Rightist elements. Yang Huanrao, the head of the China Democratic League in Hanyang County and a henchman of Ma Zemin, was one of the masterminds of the counter-revolutionary riot that occurred at Hanyang No. 1 Middle School in mid-June.

During the Great Blooming and Contending period, these democratic parties took the opportunity to develop a large number of bad elements to join their organizations, attempting to increase their political capital for attacking the Party. In June, the China Democratic League developed six new members in a certain school, all of whom were dissatisfied with the Party. Some heads of the China Democratic League openly called on bad elements to join the League on the "front line" against the Party. Therefore, some democratic party organizations, under the control of Rightist elements at the time, once embarked on the road of betraying the people.

Since mid-June, members of the democratic parties have launched fierce counterattacks against these Rightist elements. The anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes of the Rightist elements were quickly exposed. Among these struggles, the struggle of the China Democratic League against the Ma Zemin Rightist clique was the most intense. They held a rally of more than 300 people and dozens of debates and forums, quickly suppressing the arrogance of the Rightist elements, and the Rightist elements' fallacies were refuted completely. The Rightist elements in other democratic parties have also gradually become isolated, some Rightist cliques have been broken, and some Rightist elements have expressed their willingness to bow their heads to the people and plead guilty.

After more than a month of struggle, the organizations of the democratic parties in Wuhan have begun to turn to the left, the left-wing forces have expanded, and in particular, the leadership of most of the democratic parties has been seized by progressive forces; and many people who originally thought that the anti-Rightist campaign was a tempest in a teapot have now awakened one after another, saying, "If this battle is not fought well, there is no hope for socialism," and actively participated in the struggle.

At present, the anti-Rightist struggle of some democratic parties has developed in depth.

However, the struggle of the democratic parties in the Wuhan area against the Rightist elements is still far from meeting the demands of the broad masses, and the development is also uneven. The sentimentalism and impatience of certain leading members are hindering the deepening of the movement and are detrimental to the struggle. Since the anti-Rightist struggle, the Jiusan Society and the China Association for Promoting Democracy have not been very active, and have not even carried out the necessary struggle against Cheng Qianfan, a Rightist backbone element with so many crimes. It is reported that the Wuhan organizations of the Jiusan Society and the China Association for Promoting Democracy are actively overcoming serious sentimentalism, and some have replaced Rightist elements who had infiltrated the leadership of the anti-Rightist struggle team, and have begun to reverse the past situation of inaction.

    打退了右派的猖狂进攻
    扭转了错误的政治方向
    新华社记者评述各民主党派武汉市组织反右派斗争形势
    新华社武汉10日电　新华社记者评述武汉地区民主党派反右派斗争情况说：武汉地区各民主党派内的右派分子大部已丑态毕露，四面楚歌。一些民主党派组织经过反右派斗争，已经开始扭转他们的错误的政治方向。
    在大鸣大放期间，暗藏在武汉地区民主党派组织内的右派分子在各个方面向党进行了猖狂的进攻。其中特别是以民盟中央常委、湖北省兼武汉市主任委员马哲民为首、有副主任委员戴今生、秘书长项粹安等人参加的右派集团，民建武汉市委委员王一鸣右派集团，民革省委委员耿伯钊集团，以及民革市委主任委员晏勋甫，九三学社成员、武汉大学教授程千帆等右派骨干分子的反党反社会主义活动最为恶毒。
    民盟的马哲民右派集团曾一度把省、市民盟组织变成执行章罗联盟指示向党向社会主义进攻的大本营，成了武汉地区反党的主导力量。耿伯钊这个反动集团则叫嚣反对共产党的“大党主义”，企图向党夺取领导权。王一鸣极力贩卖章乃器的私货，而程千帆则主谋发布了“民主党派联合宣言”，鼓动学生向党“争自由、争民主、争人权”。现在已经查明：凡在大鸣大放期间向党进攻最凶的地方，都与这些右派分子的罪恶活动有关。6月中旬汉阳第一中学发生的反革命暴乱事件，马哲民的爪牙、民盟汉阳县负责人杨焕尧就是这个事件的主谋人之一。
    在大鸣大放期间，这些民主党派趁机发展了大批坏分子参加组织，企图以此增强向党进攻的政治资本。民盟6月份在某一个学校中发展的六个盟员，全是对党不满的人，有的民盟组织负责人公开号召坏分子在反党的“火线”上入盟。因此，某些民主党派组织当时在右派分子掌握下，曾一度走上背叛人民的道路。
    6月中旬以来，各民主党派成员向这些右派分子展开了猛烈的反击。右派分子中反党反社会主义罪行迅速被揭发了出来。在这些斗争中以民盟对马哲民右派集团的斗争最为紧张。他们召开了三百多人的誓师大会和几十次辩论会、座谈会，迅速地把右派分子的嚣张气焰打了下去，右派分子的谬论被驳得体无完肤。其他民主党派内的右派分子也逐渐孤立，有一些右派集团已被攻破，有些右派分子表示愿意向人民低头请罪。
    经过一个多月的斗争，各民主党派在武汉的组织已经开始向左转，左派力量已经扩大，特别是大部民主党派的领导权已被进步力量掌握；而不少原来认为反右派是小题大作的人，现在已纷纷觉悟，说“不打好这一仗社会主义就没希望”，积极参加了斗争。
    目前，部分民主党派的反右派斗争已向纵深发展。
    但是，武汉地区各民主党派反对右派分子的斗争，离广大群众的要求还相差很远，发展也不平衡。某些领导成员的温情主义和急躁情绪阻碍着运动的深入，对斗争不利。九三和民进自反右派斗争以来，活动不多，连对程千帆这样罪恶多端的右派骨干分子都没有进行必要的斗争。据悉，最近九三和民进的武汉组织正积极克服严重的温情主义，有的撤换了混进反右派斗争领导队伍中的右派分子，开始扭转过去按兵不动的局面。
