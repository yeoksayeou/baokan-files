Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan. Jiangling County, Hubei Province, recently saw peasants expose and fight back against various sabotage activities by illegal landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries. Land and houses illegally seized by landlords through reversals have been taken back by the peasants. Some illegal landlords have been disqualified as probationary members of the cooperatives and placed under the cooperatives' supervision.

After the bourgeois rightists launched a frenzied attack on socialism, many landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and rightists in Jiangling County echoed them by spreading rumors, disrupting production, and even openly beating and scolding cadres, reversing settlements with peasants, and launching a frenzied attack on agricultural cooperatives. In Chonghe Township, eight landlord households reversed settlements with the peasants. Landlord Zhang Meizhong took back three tile-roofed houses from poor peasant Zhang Meichao that had been distributed to him during the land reform. Wu Shidian, who had been a bandit in the past, colluded with more than twenty landlords to form a small group specializing in spreading rumors and sabotage. A few cooperative members were deceived by these illegal landlords and demanded to withdraw from the cooperative.

In response to the class enemies' frantic attacks, all localities combined this with current production, organized large propaganda teams, and vigorously launched propaganda and education to counter the rightists. Under the counterattack of the masses in Chonghe Township, landlord Zhang Meizhong had to bow his head and admit his guilt, returning the three tile-roofed houses he had taken back through reversals. More than 120 cooperative members of the Manan Cooperative in Mashan Township angrily exposed and struggled against the illegal landlord Chen Yeqing, who had sabotaged farm tools and incited cooperative members against the leadership. Chen Yeqing has now been disqualified as a probationary member and placed under the cooperative's supervision.

Through this exposure and counterattack against the sabotage activities of illegal landlords and rich peasants, the broad masses of cadres and people in various localities once again received a profound education in class struggle. They criticized the past paralyzing thoughts that "landlords and rich peasants have joined the cooperatives, and collectivization has been achieved, so the class struggle is over," which greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses. In Zhuji Township, twenty-seven party members were unwilling to lead production and preferred to do business and take the capitalist road. During this self-examination, they all expressed their determination to lead production well. In the Xuxin Cooperative of Chonghe Township, the twenty-one households who originally wanted to withdraw from the cooperative are now determined not to withdraw.

    江陵县大张旗鼓展开宣传教育
    农民奋起夺回被倒算的房地
    据新华社武汉讯　湖北省江陵县农民最近揭发和回击了不法地主、富农和反革命分子的各种破坏活动，不法地主向农民倒算非法夺取的土地和房屋等已经被农民要回，有的不法地主被取消候补社员资格，改为合作社管制。
    资产阶级右派分子向社会主义展开猖狂进攻以后，江陵县不少地主、富农、反革命分子和右派分子相呼应，在农村中造谣惑众，破坏生产，甚至公开打骂干部，向农民倒算，向农业社发动了猖狂进攻。冲河乡共有八户地主向农民倒算。地主张美中向贫农张美超夺回了土地改革时分得的三间瓦房。过去曾当过土匪的吴士典和二十多个地主串连在一起，组成了一个小集团，专门造谣破坏。少数社员因受这些不法地主的欺骗而要求退社。
    针对阶级敌人的疯狂进攻，各地都结合当前生产，组织了大批宣传队伍，大张旗鼓地展开了反击右派分子的宣传教育。地主张美中在冲河乡群众的反击下，不得不低头认罪，退出了倒算的三间瓦房。马山乡马南社一百二十多个社员，愤怒地揭发和斗争了破坏农具、挑拨社员反对领导的不法地主陈业青，现在陈业青已被取消候补社员资格，改为合作社管制。
    经过这次揭发和反击不法地主、富农的破坏活动，各地广大干部和群众再一次受到了深刻的阶级斗争教育，批判了过去认为“地主富农入社了，合作化了，阶级斗争结束了”等麻痹思想，大大鼓舞了干部和群众的积极性。朱集乡原有二十七个党员不愿领导生产，而愿意做生意，走资本主义道路；这次在自我检查中都表示了要将生产领导好的决心。冲河乡绪心社原来要退社的二十一户社员，现在也决心不退社了。
