Liu Fengju's Old History
Liu Fengju, an associate professor at Lanzhou Medical College who boasted of being an "epidemiology expert," had recently pretended to apply for Party membership.

But after the start of the rectification movement, Liu Fengju formed an alliance with the rightist elements of the college, Ma Futing and Tang Jiachen, to form an anti-Party and anti-people group. He cursed like a shrew, scolding the leading comrades of the Central Ministry of Health as "imperial envoys," and falsely accusing the Party and government leaders of Lanzhou Medical College of being "feudal headmen" with "ice-cold faces and the temperament of a Force 12 typhoon." Then he gnashed his teeth and said, "The feudal headman leadership style of the medical college was brought by these leading cadres from the People's Liberation Army." In his eyes, the personnel department was the so-called "root of Party sectarianism," and therefore, it was necessary to "dig out this root." He falsely accused the leaders of the personnel department of being "supreme deans," "kings of hell," holding the "book of life and death," and the "list of deities," and "whoever they want to enshrine, they can."

On the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, Liu Fengju did not hesitate to spread rumors and confuse the public, openly speaking up for counter-revolutionaries. He falsely accused the Party's policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries as "hitting everything indiscriminately," and that the Party leaders "come down on whoever they don't like," resulting in "many people being wronged by the suppression of counter-revolutionaries." He distorted the Party's united front work as "only struggle, no unity."

Why did Liu Fengju hate the Communist Party so much? After the masses exposed him, his true colors were revealed. It turned out that during the Japanese invasion of China, Liu was appreciated by Yoshida, the captain of the Japanese Gendarmerie in Shijiazhuang, for his ability to flatter and ingratiate himself. Soon, with Yoshida's help, he opened the Tongshou Hospital and served as its president. Later, he became involved with Kasahara, a major in the Japanese Tianjin Gendarmerie, and Chen Luzhong and Guan Xishan, the chiefs of the Japanese puppet police station in Shijiazhuang. Relying on the power of these enemy and puppet traitors, he obtained the position of section chief in the Japanese puppet Tianjin Municipal Health Bureau. During this period, Liu Fengju was, as the masses reflected, a "popular" and "influential" figure. Whenever Liu himself or his family had a dispute with others, they would threaten to "send them to the special service department." After the Japanese occupied Guangzhou, Liu donated a large sum of money, obtained through exploitation, to "comfort the Imperial Army" and attended the Japanese "celebration of the Imperial Army's great victory." The local masses hated this lackey of the Japanese invaders and the scum of the Chinese nation to the bone.

After Japan surrendered, Liu Fengju joined Zhang Weixiang, a major general staff officer and big secret agent in the headquarters of the 11th War Zone of the Chiang Kai-shek army. Zhang issued a "certificate" and he immediately transformed himself into an "underground worker of the Kuomintang." During this period, he joined the big secret agent Gong Xuesui, the Kuomintang mayor of Dalian, and Wang Zhimin, a Central Statistics Bureau (CC Clique) secret agent, and gained the trust of these high-ranking Kuomintang secret agents. He was appointed as a "special commissioner" of the puppet government to "take over" Dalian; deceiving and extorting the people, committing all kinds of evil. (Attached picture)

    刘逢举的老底子
    兰州医学院副教授、自吹为“流行病学专家”的刘逢举，不久以前还假惺惺地申请入党。
    但整风运动开始后，刘逢举就和该院右派分子马馥庭、唐家琛的反党反人民集团结成联盟。他像泼妇骂街似的，骂中央卫生部的领导同志是“钦差大臣”，诬蔑兰州医学院党政领导为“封建把头”，“冰点以下的面孔，十二级台风的作风”。接着又咬牙切齿地说：“医学院封建把头的领导方式，是这些领导干部从人民解放军中带来的”。在他的眼里，人事部门是所谓党的“宗派主义的根子”，因此，就必须“挖掉这个根子”。他诬蔑人事部门的领导是“太上院长”，是“阎王爷”，掌握着“生死簿”、“封神榜”，“想封谁就封谁”。
    在肃反问题上，刘逢举不惜造谣惑众，公然为反革命张目。他诬蔑党的肃反政策是“乱打一起”，党的领导“看谁不顺眼，就来一下”，结果“肃反将好多人都冤枉了。”歪曲党的统一战线工作为“只有战，没有统”。
    刘逢举为什么这样仇恨共产党？经过群众的揭露，他的狐狸尾巴才暴露出来，原来日寇侵华期间，刘因善于阿谀逢迎，为石家庄日宪兵队长吉田所赏识，不久，在吉田的帮助下，开设了同寿医院并任院长。后又与日本驻天津宪兵队长笠原少佐及石家庄日伪警察所长陈履中、管锡山等挂上了钩，依靠这批敌伪汉奸的势力，获得了日伪天津市卫生局科长的职位。这个时期的刘逢举正如群众反映的是“吃得开”的“红人”。刘本人及其家人遇着和别人争执时，动辄以“送特务科”来威胁。日寇侵占广州后，刘以剥削的民脂民膏捐出巨款“慰问皇军”，并出席日寇“庆祝皇军大胜”大会。当地群众对这个日寇的奴才，中华民族的败类，是恨之入骨。
    日本投降后，刘逢举投奔蒋军第十一战区司令部长官处少将参谋、大特务张维湘门下，由张签发一张“证明”，他即一变而为“国民党地下工作人员”。在此期间他投奔大特务国民党大连市市长龚学遂、中统特务王治民等人，取得了这些国民党高级特务的信任，而被委任为伪“接收”大连市的政府“专员”；欺骗敲诈人民，无恶不作。（附图片）
