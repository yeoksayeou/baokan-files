    Anyue County Chef Conference
　　Promoting Sweet Potato Products to Save Fine Grains
    (Our report) The Anyue County in Sichuan Province recently held a county-wide chef representative conference. The conference focused on exchanging and promoting experiences in making sweet potato (red sweet potato) foods to save fine grains.
    Anyue County is a hilly area with a large sweet potato yield. Since sweet potatoes are not easy to transport, promoting sweet potato foods locally to save grain is a very important task. The chef of the No. 2 Cooperative Restaurant in Chengguan Town, Anyue County, introduced seventeen kinds of sweet potato products such as steamed buns, stuffed buns, noodles, sesame seed cakes, yuanzi (dumplings), flower rolls, and yellow cakes. These sweet potato products are inexpensive and of good quality, and the masses are very satisfied. (Yao Rong)

    安岳县厨师会议
　　推广甘薯制品节约细粮
    本报讯　四川省安岳县最近召开了一个全县厨师代表会议。会议着重交流与推广了制红苕（甘薯）食品，以节约细粮的经验。
    安岳县是丘陵地带，红苕产量很大。由于红苕不便于调运，所以在当地推广红苕食品，以节约粮食是非常重要的一项任务。安岳县城关镇第二合作食店的厨师介绍了用红苕制成馒头、包子、面条、烧饼、元子、花卷、黄糕等十七种花样的作法。这些红苕制品价廉物美，群众很满意。　（姚荣）
