    Tractor Factory Begins to Support the Countryside
    The Luoyang Tractor Factory, whose construction project is not yet completed, has now begun to support agricultural tractor stations in various regions. Currently, the factory is manufacturing 488 types of spare parts for the Det 54 and Stalin 80 tractors for the Shuangqiao Tractor Station in Beijing. By the time of this year's autumn harvest, more than 8,000 spare parts manufactured by the Luoyang Tractor Factory, used to repair and assemble tractors, will be directly used on China's agricultural production front.
    Before this, tractor stations in Xinxiang, Xingyang, and Luoyang Pingle in Henan Province had received some tractor parts from here. During the summer harvest and summer planting period, the tractors at the Pingle Tractor Station were damaged with parts such as the support wheel axle and support wheel cover. They requested the Luoyang Tractor Factory to produce them, but they did not have the necessary drawings and other technological data to produce these parts. The tractor factory workers used the broken parts as samples, drew the drawings, and rushed to produce more than 360 parts, ensuring the smooth progress of the summer harvest and summer planting at the Pingle Tractor Station.
    Currently, the last two workshops of the Luoyang Tractor Factory are under construction, and the production workshops are installing equipment. Nine workshops have already been put into production. The 736 pieces of equipment that have been successively put into operation have created the first batch of wealth for the country, worth more than 550,000 yuan. Seventeen units, including the Nanjing Chemical Plant, Hanyang Machinery Factory, the General Bureau of Water Conservancy, and the Shangyou Engineering Bureau, have successively placed orders with the tractor factory. The tractor factory manufactures gears, hydraulic presses, and strictly required raft track lifting and transportation equipment and other mechanical equipment for these units.

    拖拉机厂开始支援农村
    建厂工程尚未完成的洛阳拖拉机厂，现在已经开始支援各地农业拖拉机站了。目前，这个厂正在为北京双桥拖拉机站制造德特54型和斯大林80号拖拉机的四百八十八种备件。到今年秋收时节，由洛阳拖拉机厂制造的用来修配拖拉机的八千多个备件，将直接用在我国的农业生产战线上。
    在这以前，河南省新乡、荥阳、洛阳平乐等拖拉机站，曾在这里得到了拖拉机的部分零件。平乐拖拉机站的拖拉机，在夏收夏种期间损坏了支重轮轴和支重轮盖等零件，要求洛阳拖拉机厂制作，但是没有制作这些零件所必需的图纸和其他工艺资料。拖拉机厂工人就以坏了的零件为样品，绘出图纸，赶工制出三百六十多个零件，保证了平乐拖拉机站夏收夏种的顺利进行。
    目前，洛阳拖拉机厂的最后两个工场正在施工，生产工场在安装设备。有九个车间已经投入生产。陆续开动起来的七百三十六台设备，为国家创造的第一批财富，价值五十五万余元。南京化工厂、汉阳机械厂、水利总局、上犹工程局等十七个单位，已经先后向拖拉机厂定货。拖拉机厂为这些单位制造齿轮、水压机和要求严密的筏道起重运输设备等机械设备。
