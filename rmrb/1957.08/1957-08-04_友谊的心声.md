    Voices of Friendship
    To the Comrades of the People's Daily Editorial Department:
    Since my birth, I have never been abroad, and of course, I have never been to your country. I learned Chinese in Japan. Recently, I wrote a poem in Chinese. I am afraid that there are many places in this poem that do not conform to Chinese grammar. Even so, I believe this poem signifies the degree of concern that the Japanese people have for your country. If the people of your country can see from this the ardent love of our people for your country, I would be endlessly grateful.
                               Lin Maotaro, July 16th

    Beijing, I Really Want to See You
    Japan, Lin Maotaro
    Beijing, I have never seen you
    But my compatriots are flocking
    Like migratory birds flying to Beijing
    It is said that your face has greatly changed
    People are well-fed and energetic
    Truly worthy of being our example
    Beijing, I have never seen you
    In the past, I only knew "Rickshaw Boy’s" Beijing
    That dirty, chaotic city
  “Lao Zhang's Philosophy’s” Beijing
    The helpless city where the children of the landlord class went to study
    I have also heard that Beijing is a green city
    That can rival the beauty of Vienna
    You, beautiful city
    It is said that you have been completely renewed
    And have become a model for Asian and African countries
    I know
    Now you are related to the fate of Asian and African countries
    Shining like the sun in every corner
    Standing like a lighthouse on the stormy sea
    Peaceful coexistence, the Five Principles
    This has become the belief
        Of our country's peace-loving people
      Beijing, you are our ideal
      Since ancient times
    Our country has had close relations with your country
    This was the case in the past
      This should be the case now
      And it will certainly be the case in the future
      Our country's peace-loving people fly to Beijing one after another
      Like migratory birds
      Bringing the ardent
        Love of our people for your country
      Beijing, I have never seen you
    But I know how beautiful you are
      How magnificent you are
      Our lighthouse, Beijing
      I really want to see you

    I Met You Again on the Screen
    Dear Ms. Nobuko Otowa:
    I recently watched the Japanese films "Wolf" and "Epitome," and I was very happy to meet you again through the screen.
    In these films, you successfully created the images of Akiko, a widow who was forced to take risks and rob a mail truck due to the pressures of life, and Ginko, a Japanese geisha who was subjected to oppression and abuse. You once said: "For an actor, the most important thing is to grasp the character's personality. Only after paying a great deal of effort can the created character move people. Any idea of taking shortcuts is wrong." It is clear that, like the characters you created in other films, you put in a lot of effort when creating the characters in these two films. Your highly artistic creativity and delicate acting deeply infected Chinese audiences and tightly gripped their hearts. In the cinema, I heard low sobs; when the show ended, I also saw many women wiping their reddened eyes with handkerchiefs. These were tears of sympathy shed by Chinese audiences for the many Japanese women represented by Akiko and Ginko who were in dire straits! You are an ideal actor who is willing to serve the vast audience through your art. I believe you must be very happy to hear these words.
    Your name is not unfamiliar to Chinese audiences. Because we have not only seen you on the screen, but also met you when you came to China last year to participate in the "Japanese Film Week."
    Do you remember what happened last year at this time, on the night you met the audience at the "Great Light" cinema in Shanghai? As soon as you walked into the cinema, the audience applauded warmly. Thousands of hands, ah, reached out to you. You took a small package from one of them. You held it tightly in your hand, afraid of it being squeezed out. Later, when you opened it – it was a very unique peace dove pin! You also entrusted reporters to thank this unknown audience member through the newspaper. Do you know? This was a gift given to you by an ordinary Chinese female student. She transferred the beloved gift that others had given her to you in order to express the sincere friendship of the Chinese people towards the Japanese people. This small gift represents the heart of the Chinese people, ah!
    The waters of the Yangtze River and the Yellow River and the waters of the Edo River and the Tendō River all flow into the ocean, but the ocean cannot stop the desire of the people of China and Japan to strive for peace and promote friendship! Although diplomatic relations between the two countries have not yet been restored, peace and friendship do not require passports! Let the peace dove spread its wings of friendship, fly over the ocean, and connect the hearts of the Chinese and Japanese people more closely together!
    I hope that in the near future, I can see you not only on the screen, but also on the stage of our cinema.
    I wish you greater achievements in artistic creation!
                        Chinese Audience, Qu Mai, 1957.7.20, in Shanghai

    友谊的心声
    人民日报编辑同志：
    我自出生以来直到现在从没有出过国，当然也没有去过贵国。我的中国话是在日本国内学习的。最近我用中文写了一首诗。这首诗怕有许多地方不合中文文法。虽然如此，我相信这首诗标志着日本人民对贵国的关心程度。如果贵国人民从这里看得出我国人民对贵国的热烈爱戴的话，那就感激不尽了。
                               林茂太郎　7月16日
    北京，我真想看看你
    日本　林茂太郎北京，我从未见过你可是我的同胞成群结队像候鸟一般飞向北京据说你的面貌已大大改变人们丰衣足食，活泼有劲真值得作我们的榜样北京，我从未见过你过去只知道“骆驼祥子”的北京那肮脏、杂乱的城市
  “老张的哲学”的北京地主阶级子弟们游学的那无可奈何的城市还听说过北京是绿化的城市能媲美维也纳的美丽你，美丽的城市据说已万象更新已成为亚非国家的榜样我知道
    现在你关系亚非国家的命运
    像太阳一般照耀着一切角落
    像灯塔一般屹立在怒涛海面上
    和平共处、五项原则
    这已成为我国爱好和平人士的
        信念
      北京，你是我们的理想
      自古以来
    我国与贵国有密切的关系
    过去曾经是这样
      现在应该是这样
      将来也一定会是这样
      我国和平人士陆续飞到北京
      像候鸟一般
      带着我国人民对贵国的热烈
        爱戴
      北京，我从未见过你
    但是我知道，你是多么美丽
      你是多么雄伟
      我们的灯塔，北京
      我真想看看你（按：这首诗经本报编者略加修改）
    在银幕上又和你见面了
    亲爱的乙羽信子女士：
    最近看了日本故事片“狼”和“缩影”，很高兴地通过银幕，又跟你见面了。
    你在这些影片里成功地创造了为生活所迫，不得不铤而走险、拦劫邮车的寡妇——秋子和备受压迫和蹂躏的日本艺妓——银子的形象。你曾经说过：“对于一个演员来说，最重要的是要掌握角色的性格。只有在付出了巨大的劳动以后，创造的角色才能感动人，任何想走捷径的想法都是错误的。”显而易见，跟你在其他影片里创造的角色一样，在创造这两部影片里的角色时，你是付出了巨大的劳动的。你那高度艺术创造性和细腻的演技，深深地感染着中国观众，紧紧地抓住了中国观众的心。在电影院里，我听到低低的啜泣声；散场时我还看到不少妇女用手帕擦着哭红了的眼睛。这是中国观众对以秋子、银子为代表的许许多多处在水深火热中的日本妇女洒下的同情的热泪！你是一位有理想的、愿意通过自己的艺术为广大观众服务的演员，我相信，听了这些话你一定是很高兴的。
    你的名字对中国观众并不是陌生的。因为我们不仅在银幕上看到过你，而且在你去年来中国参加“日本电影周”时，还和你见过面。
    你还记得去年这个时候，在上海“大光明”电影院跟观众见面那天晚上的事情吗？你一走进电影院，观众们就热情地鼓起掌来了。千百双手呵，伸向你。你从其中的一双手接过一小包东西。你紧紧地抓在手心里，深怕被挤掉。后来一打开，——是一只很别致的和平鸽别针！你还曾委托记者，通过报纸向这位不知名的观众致过谢呢。你知道吗？这是一位普通的中国女学生送给你的礼物。她把别人送给她的、自己心爱的礼物转送给你，为的是表示中国人民对日本人民的真挚的友谊。这小小的礼物，代表着中国人民的心意呵！
    长江、黄河的水和江户川、天童川的水都流入海洋，可是海洋阻挡不住中日两国人民争取和平、增进友谊的愿望！尽管目前两国的邦交还没有恢复，但，和平和友谊并不需要护照！让和平鸽子展开友谊的翅膀，飞过海洋，把中日两国人民的心，更紧密地联结在一起吧！
    希望在不久的将来，不仅在银幕上、而在我们的电影院讲台上，能再一次地看到你。
    祝你在艺术创造上取得更大的成就！
                        中国观众　瞿麦　1957、7、20、于上海
