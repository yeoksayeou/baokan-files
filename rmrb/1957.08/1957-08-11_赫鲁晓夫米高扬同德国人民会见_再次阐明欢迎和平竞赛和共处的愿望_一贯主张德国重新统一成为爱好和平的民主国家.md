Xinhua News Agency, August 9th: TASS reports that members of the Soviet Party and Government delegation, Khrushchev, Gromyko, and others, arrived in Leipzig around midnight on August 8th. First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, Ulbricht, accompanied them. Despite the late hour, many citizens stood on the streets waiting for their arrival.

    A brief mass rally began. First Secretary of the Leipzig District Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, Fröhlich, expressed great joy at the visit of the Soviet guests to Leipzig.

    Khrushchev then spoke, pointing out that the German Democratic Republic is a forward post in the great family of socialist countries. The socialist construction in Germany is being carried out under the constant threat of hostile forces. Socialism is being consolidated under extremely difficult conditions, and this difficulty arises from the division of the country and from the many obstacles created by certain foreign forces who do not want to see Germany reunified into a peaceful and democratic country. Nevertheless, the working people of Germany have made significant achievements in strengthening the republic's economy.

    The Socialist Unity Party of Germany has played a significant role in this, steadfastly realizing the great ideals of Marxism-Leninism and the principles of proletarian internationalism. The working people of the German Democratic Republic believe, based on the facts, that the Socialist Unity Party of Germany has no other interests besides the interests of the German people.

    Khrushchev said: Reactionary groups swaggeringly attempt to intimidate the people of socialist countries. This is not a wise policy. We are not cowards, and we are fully prepared to welcome uninvited guests and deliver a fatal blow to any aggression against any socialist country.

    Speaking about the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems, Khrushchev said: We uphold peace precisely because we are unwaveringly confident in socialism and in its final victory. We are not afraid of competition with capitalism and are convinced that socialism will triumph over capitalism, whether in economic, cultural, or in the endeavor to create living standards that meet the beautiful aspirations of mankind.

    Now, when various systems exist, they should live together harmoniously and respect each other, each proving the superiority of its system. They should compete in peaceful creation, eliminating poverty and exploitation, and conquering nature, rather than in inventing increasingly new weapons of mass destruction. We firmly believe that a consolidated and lasting peace can be established. We Communists have always followed these principles. Every honest person will see how significant the Soviet Union's proposals to cease testing atomic and hydrogen bombs, ban these deadly weapons, destroy stockpiles of these weapons, and reduce conventional armaments and the size of armed forces are for maintaining peace. The fault that these urgent and important proposals have not yet been adopted does not lie with the Soviet Union.

    The Soviet Union and other socialist countries have not had, do not now have, any hostility towards other countries, including West Germany. We desire international peace. The Soviet Union believes that the friendship and mutual understanding between Germany and the Soviet Union is the most important guarantee of peace and security in Europe. If our two peoples can coexist peacefully in friendship and work together to safeguard peace in Europe, it will not be easy for imperialists to provoke a new war.

    Khrushchev then spoke about the reunification of Germany. He said: We have consistently advocated that the German people reunify their homeland into a peace-loving and democratic country as soon as possible. If such a Germany has not yet been established, it is only because the imperialist blocs do not want this unified, peace-loving Germany to appear. The only thing they want is for Germany to become their militaristic henchman in Europe.

    Khrushchev emphasized: Whether the imperialists can relaunch a new war depends in many ways on the German people. Therefore, under the current circumstances, all progressive forces of the German people, all those who truly cherish the interests of Germany, are doing their utmost to jointly curb the militaristic and revanchist forces that are gradually rising in West Germany. The peace-loving people of the world are expecting the German people, especially the working class of West Germany, to make every necessary effort to prevent the militarists from regaining control of the fate of the German people.

    A group of members of the Soviet Party and Government delegation composed of Mikoyan, Kumykin, and others, accompanied by Grotewohl, arrived in Sassnitz on the 9th, where they visited a large fisheries combine. They had sincere conversations with the workers. After the visit to the combine, a mass rally was held, at which Mikoyan spoke.

    Mikoyan said: The Soviet people are very familiar with the high-quality products of the young Stralsund shipbuilding industry. The reputation of state-owned enterprises in the German Democratic Republic is growing higher and higher, and the workers, technicians, engineers, and all working people of the German Democratic Republic have every reason to be proud of this.

    Speaking about the German people's just struggle for the unification of their homeland, Mikoyan pointed out: The German Democratic Republic's proposal to establish a German federation is a major contribution to creating realistic preconditions for resolving the national problem of the German people.

    He said: The Soviet people and the Soviet government support this wise proposal because it provides a realistic premise for unifying Germany on the basis of negotiations between the two Germanys and is in line with the interests of safeguarding peace in Europe.

    Speaking about the Bonn government's policy of atomic armament, he said: Launching an atomic war in Europe would mean, first and foremost, the destruction of important central cities in Germany and the devastation of the German population. Therefore, fighting against the preparation for an atomic war in Europe is the sacred duty of every European and every patriotic German.

    赫鲁晓夫米高扬同德国人民会见
    再次阐明欢迎和平竞赛和共处的愿望
    一贯主张德国重新统一成为爱好和平的民主国家
    据新华社9日讯　据塔斯社讯：苏联党和政府代表团团员赫鲁晓夫、葛罗米柯等人8日近午夜的时候到达了来比锡。德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希陪同他们一起前来。虽然时间这样晚，许多市民还是站在大街上等候他们到来。
    一个简短的群众大会开始了。德国统一社会党来比锡专区委员会第一书记弗勒利希对苏联客人访问来比锡表示非常高兴。
    赫鲁晓夫随后讲话。他指出：德意志民主共和国是社会主义国家大家庭中的一个前哨。德国的社会主义建设是在敌对势力的不断威胁下进行的。社会主义在极其困难的条件下日益巩固，这种困难的产生是由于国家分裂，由于某些不愿意看到德国统一成为一个和平和民主的国家的外国势力在制造重重的障碍。尽管如此，德国的劳动人民在加强共和国经济方面还是获得了重大的成就。
    德国统一社会党在其中起了重大的作用，它坚持不渝地实现着马克思列宁主义的伟大理想和无产阶级同国际主义的原则。德意志民主共和国的劳动人民根据事实相信，德国统一社会党除了德国人民的利益以外别无其他利益。
    赫鲁晓夫说：反动集团耀武扬威地企图吓倒社会主义国家的人民。这是不聪明的政策。我们不是胆小鬼，我们有充分的准备来迎接不速之客，给任何社会主义国家遭到的任何侵略以致命的回击。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到不同社会制度的国家的和平共处的问题时说：我们维护和平正是因为我们毫不动摇地相信社会主义、相信它的最后胜利。我们并不害怕同资本主义竞赛，而且确信，无论在经济、文化方面以及在创造符合人类美好愿望的生活水平的事业中进行竞赛，社会主义必将战胜资本主义。
    现在，当各种制度都存在的时候，彼此应该和睦地互相尊重，各自证明其制度的优越性，应该在和平创造、消灭贫穷和剥削、征服自然方面竞赛，而不是在发明越来越新的大规模毁灭性武器方面竞赛。我们坚信，巩固的持久和平是能够建立起来的。我们共产党始终遵循着这些原则。每一个正直的人都会看到，苏联关于停止试验原子弹和氢弹、禁止这种杀人武器、销毁这种武器的储备，裁减常规军备和武装部队人数等建议对维护和平有着何等的意义。这些迫切重要的建议至今未被采纳，其过失并不在于苏联。
    苏联和其他社会主义国家对别的国家，包括西德在内，过去没有，现在也没有任何敌意。我们希望国际和平。苏联认为，德国和苏联的友好以及相互了解是欧洲和平和安全的最重要的保证。如果我们两国人民能够友好地和平共处，一致努力为维护欧洲的和平而斗争的话，那么帝国主义者要想挑起新战争将是不容易的。
    赫鲁晓夫接着谈到德国统一的问题。他说：我们一贯主张，德国人民尽快地把自己的祖国重新统一成一个爱好和平的民主国家。如果说这样的德国到现在还没有建立的话，那只是因为帝国主义集团不希望有这个统一的爱好和平的德国出现。它们唯一希望的只是德国成为它们在欧洲的军国主义打手。
    赫鲁晓夫着重指出：帝国主义者能否重新发动新战争，在许多方面取决于德国人民。因此，在目前情况下，德国人民一切进步的力量，一切真正珍视德国利益的人，都竭力共同制止在西德逐渐抬头的军国主义和复仇主义势力。世界各国爱好和平的人民在期待德国人民，首先期待西德的工人阶级作一切必要的努力，不让军国主义者重新控制德国人民的命运。
    由米高扬、库米金等人组成的苏联党和政府代表团的一批团员由格罗提渥陪同，9日到达了萨斯尼支市，他们在那里参观了一个大的渔业联合厂。他们同工人进行了诚挚的谈话。在联合厂参观以后举行了一个群众大会，米高扬在会上讲了话。
    米高扬说：苏联人民很熟悉年青的斯特拉尔松造船工业的高级产品。德意志民主共和国国营企业的声誉愈来愈高了，德意志民主共和国的工人、技术员、工程师和全体劳动人民理应为此感到自豪。
    米高扬在谈到德国人民争取统一自己祖国的正义斗争时指出：德意志民主共和国政府关于建立德意志联邦的建议，是为解决德国人民的全国问题创造现实的先决条件的一大贡献。
    他说：苏联人民和苏联政府支持这种明智的建议，因为这种建议提供了现实的前提来在两个德国谈判的基础上统一德国，并且符合于保卫欧洲和平的利益。
    他在谈到波恩政府的原子武装政策时说：在欧洲发动原子战争，这就意味着，首先是德国的重要中心城市的毁灭以及德国居民的浩劫。所以，为反对在欧洲准备原子战争而斗争，是每一个欧洲人、每一个爱国的德国人的神圣职责。
