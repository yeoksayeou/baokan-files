Music Can Indeed Make Cows Produce More Milk

    Taiyuan City Workers' Dairy Farm, in order to increase milk production, began using a gramophone to play music records in the cowshed on July 6th, based on the news report "Indian Army Officer Plays Piano for Cows to Increase Milk" published in the newspaper. After ten days of experimentation, the milk production of all forty-five milk cows in the farm has significantly improved.

    Before and after the installation, the feeding management conditions of the farm remained unchanged, while the original average daily milk production of the forty-five milk cows was 889 jin. After the installation, the average daily milk production increased to 1,029 jin during the ten-day experiment, which is an average of 140 jin more per day than before the installation. In particular, the No. 55 hybrid cow in the farm, due to hearing pleasant records every time it was milked, concentrated its mind and listened attentively; therefore, its milk production increased from an average of more than 28 jin per day to more than 33 jin per day in the ten days before and after. If the broadcasting is stopped or the sound is too loud or too mixed (such as playing Peking opera records, etc.), the milk production will decrease. (Han Wenjie)

    音乐确能使牛多产奶
    太原市工人奶场，为提高产乳量，根据报上登载的“印度陆军军官对牛弹琴增加牛奶”的新闻后，于7月6日开始用电唱机对牛厩放送音乐唱片。经十天的试验，全场四十五头产奶牛，奶量都有显著的提高。
    该场在安装前后，饲养管理条件均未改变，而四十五头产奶牛原平均日产八百八十九斤。安装后，十天的试验平均日产奶增到一千零二十九斤，比安装前每日平均多产一百四十斤。特别是该场五十五号杂交牛，在每次挤奶时，由于听到和蔼愉快的唱片，精神集中，侧耳静听；因此，产乳量在前后十天内，由原平均日产二十八斤多增加到三十三斤多。如果停止放送或放的声音较大较杂的时候（如放京剧唱片等），产奶量就要下降。  （韩文杰）
