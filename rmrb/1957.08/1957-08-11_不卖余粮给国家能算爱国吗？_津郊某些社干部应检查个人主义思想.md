Is it patriotic to not sell surplus grain to the state?
Some commune cadres in the Tianjin suburbs should examine their individualistic thinking

(Our newspaper Tianjin, 10th dispatch) The plan for Tianjin suburban areas to purchase 8 million jin of wheat had only reached 6,669,000 jin by the 5th. One of the reasons the plan was not completed well is that some farmers have developed individualistic thinking, only caring about themselves and not the country. The state issued advance grain purchase funds long ago, but the Xingguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in the eastern suburbs harvested more than 50,000 jin of wheat, and the production team leaders were unwilling to sell a single grain to the state. The Lu Beikou Agricultural Cooperative in the western suburbs only completed half of its unified purchase task, and the members distributed the rest of the wheat as they harvested it. In the western suburbs, 80% of individual households did not sell wheat to the state according to regulations. The Jin Xing Agricultural Cooperative in the northern suburbs added impurities when selling wheat to the state. In Zhu Tang Township, 10% of the wheat sold to the state was mixed with sand. After being discovered, the commune cadres defiantly refused to sell, intending to distribute the wheat to the members. Currently, the leading bodies are preparing to conduct in-depth socialist education in the suburban rural areas to criticize capitalist thinking on the grain issue.

    不卖余粮给国家能算爱国吗？
    津郊某些社干部应检查个人主义思想
    本报天津10日电　天津市郊区统购小麦八百万斤的计划，到5日只完成六百六十六万九千斤。计划完成得不好，原因之一是某些农民滋长了只顾自己不顾国家的个人主义思想。国家早就发放了预购粮款，但东郊星光农业生产社收了五万多斤小麦，生产队长们一粒也不愿卖给国家。西郊路碑口农业社的统购任务只完成一半，其他的麦子社员们就随打随分了。西郊区有80％的单干户不按规定把麦子卖给国家。北郊区金星农业社卖麦子给国家时掺假。朱塘乡卖给国家的麦子中掺有10％砂土，被发现后，社干部就赌气不卖，要把麦子分给社员。目前，领导机关正准备在郊区农村深入开展社会主义教育，批判粮食问题上的资本主义思想。
