　　Xinhua News Agency, August 25th, London (TASS): Pam Dutt, Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee of the British Communist Party, published an article in the "Daily Worker" entitled "Do Not Interfere in Syria."

　　Dutt exposed the imperialists' conspiracy of aggression against Syria, saying: "All the familiar danger signals are appearing. The Hitler tactic of frantically shouting about 'communist danger' and 'Russian influence' has been adopted against this selected target. The US Sixth Fleet is being mobilized. Chauvinistic newspapers have begun major propaganda."

　　He emphasized that the imperialists are preparing to invade Syria because "Western monopolists want to profit from controlling oil resources. They are trying to subjugate the people of the Middle East and attempt to exploit them. Therefore, they hate Arab liberation and try to stop it."

　　Dutt concluded: "What concerns the people of all countries is to immediately smash this conspiracy against Syria. The peace of the Middle East and the national independence of the people of the Middle East are of vital importance to the people of Britain and the world."

　　不许干涉叙利亚
    英共副主席杜德撰文
　　新华社25日讯　据塔斯社伦敦24日电：英国共产党执行委员会副主席帕姆·杜德在“工人日报”上发表了一篇文章，题目是“不许干涉叙利亚”。
    杜德揭露帝国主义者对叙利亚的侵略阴谋说：“所有熟悉的危险信号都出现了。对这个被选作攻击对象的国家，采取了希特勒的策略，疯狂叫嚣‘共产主义危险’、‘俄国的影响’。美国第六舰队正在调动。沙文主义的报纸开始大事宣传”。
    他强调指出，帝国主义者准备侵略叙利亚是因为“西方垄断资本家想从控制石油资源中取得利润。他们企图使中东人民屈服，并且企图剥削他们。因此他们憎恨阿拉伯人解放，力图阻止这种解放。”
    杜德最后写道：“各国人民所关心的是立即粉碎这种反对叙利亚的阴谋。中东的和平和中东各国人民的民族独立对英国和世界各国人民来说，都有切身重大的关系”。
