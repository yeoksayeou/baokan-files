Xinhua News Agency, Jinhua, 17th: The seventeen counter-revolutionary bandits who attacked the CCP District Committee and District Public Office in Lipu District, Jinhua County, Zhejiang Province, last month have been sentenced to death and imprisonment by the Jinhua District Intermediate People's Court. In this attack, the district chief and the CCP District Committee Organization Committee member, among others, were seriously injured, and the district People's Bank branch was also robbed.

This counter-revolutionary group of thirty-two people was formed in mid-June this year. On July 16th, seventeen of them, led by bandit leader Feng Zhengcai, sneaked into Lipu Town with weapons such as broadswords and bamboo spears. Taking advantage of the fact that most of the district cadres were away at meetings, they attacked the CCP District Committee and District Public Office, wounding District Chief Jin Baiyou and others. They robbed a total of four rifles and wooden-shell guns, then rushed into the People's Bank branch, wounding accountant Shi Yusheng, and robbed 3,620 yuan in Renminbi. Feng Zhengcai and others even shouted counter-revolutionary slogans in the streets.

Most of the bandits fled to the mountains in neighboring counties after the crime, and some disguised themselves as peddlers, attempting to flee elsewhere. However, under the encirclement and suppression by the public security department and local garrison troops, all thirty-two bandits have been arrested. According to the local People's Procuratorate's prosecution of the first batch of seventeen criminals, the Jinhua District Intermediate People's Court publicly sentenced the principal offenders Feng Zhengcai and twelve others to death (which has been reported to the Supreme People's Court for review and approval) on the 14th and 15th. Other criminals were sentenced to life imprisonment and fixed-term imprisonment, respectively.

The vast majority of these bandits were counter-revolutionary elements, demobilized soldiers and bandits under surveillance, as well as criminals who had been punished for engaging in grain black market trading or tax evasion. The bandit leader Feng Zhengcai was a former puppet patrol officer. During the period when bourgeois rightists were launching a frenzied attack on the Communist Party and socialism, he and several other bandits believed that the time had come, and they carried out counter-revolutionary activities wildly. On the one hand, Feng Zhengcai and others collected right-wing remarks and rumors published in newspapers, such as "the Party's world" and "the relationship between the Communist Party and the masses is very tense," to incite the masses, and at the same time, they tried their best to recruit people to join.

An important reason why the counter-revolutionary bandits were able to succeed this time was the paralysis of some local public security personnel. Before the incident, the masses had reported to the county public security bureau that bandits were active in the vicinity, but the relevant public security personnel did not pay attention to it and take immediate measures.

    袭击区委  抢劫银行
    金华十七名反革命被严办
    新华社金华17日电  在上月袭击浙江省金华县澧浦区中共区委会和区公所的十七名反革命匪徒，已被金华地区中级人民法院分别判处死刑和徒刑。在这次袭击中，区长和中共区委组织委员等四人被击重伤，区里的人民银行营业所也被抢劫。
    这个有三十二人的反革命集团是在今年6月中旬组成的。7月16日，其中十七人在匪首冯正彩率领下，匿带扑刀、竹叶枪等凶器潜入澧浦镇，乘区里干部大部分在外开会的时候袭击中共区委会和区公所，把区长金柏友等砍伤，劫走步枪和木壳枪共四支，随后又冲进人民银行营业所把会计施余生击伤，抢去人民币三千六百二十元。冯正彩等最后还上街大呼反革命口号。
    大部分匪徒在作案后逃往邻近县份的山中，有的化装成小贩，企图外窜，但在公安部门和当地驻军的围剿下，三十二个匪徒已全部落网。金华地区中级人民法院根据当地人民检察院对第一批罪犯十七人的起诉，在14和15两日公开判处主犯冯正彩等十二人死刑（已报请最高人民法院审查批准）。对其他罪犯分别判处无期徒刑和有期徒刑。
    这伙匪徒绝大部分是被管制的反革命分子、兵痞和土匪，也有因从事粮食黑市买卖或偷税而受到惩办的犯罪分子。匪首冯正彩过去是伪巡官，在资产阶级右派分子向共产党和社会主义进行猖狂进攻期间，他和另外几个匪徒认为时机已到，便猖狂地进行反革命活动。冯正彩等一方面搜集报上刊登的“党天下”、“共产党与群众关系十分紧张”等右派言论和谣言向群众进行煽动，同时极力拉人入伙。
    反革命匪徒们这次能够得逞的一个重要原因是当地某些公安人员的麻痹。在案件发生前就有群众向县公安局报告附近有匪徒活动，但是有关的公安人员没有引起重视和立即采取措施。
