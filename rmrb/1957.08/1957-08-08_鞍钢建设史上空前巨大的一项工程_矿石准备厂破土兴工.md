Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 7th. A man-made iron ore joint enterprise – the Ore Preparation Plant – broke ground at the foot of the Dong Anshan Iron Mine. A large construction team, already gathered here, held a groundbreaking ceremony today.

The Ore Preparation Plant is an unprecedentedly huge project in the history of Anshan Iron and Steel construction. It has three basic production workshops – the ore crushing workshop, the flotation beneficiation workshop, and the sintering workshop. The first phase of the plant is expected to be completed by the end of next year. After completion, the man-made iron ore produced annually can be used to smelt 1.5 million tons of pig iron.

The main raw material for this plant will come from the large-scale Dong Anshan open-pit iron mine, which is under accelerated construction.

The design and equipment of this man-made iron ore joint enterprise are basically made by our own country. It is a new above-quota project added outside of China's first Five-Year Plan.

    鞍钢建设史上空前巨大的一项工程
    矿石准备厂破土兴工
    新华社鞍山7日电　一座人造富铁矿联合企业——矿石准备厂在东鞍山铁矿山脚下破土兴建。早已集中到这里的一支庞大的施工队伍，今天举行了开工典礼。
    矿石准备厂是鞍钢建设史上空前巨大的一项工程。它有着三个基本生产车间——矿石破碎车间、浮游选矿车间和烧结车间。这个厂的第一期工程预计明年底建成；建成以后，每年生产的人造富铁矿可以炼制一百五十万吨生铁。
    这个工厂的主要原料，将来自规模宏大的东鞍山露天铁矿；这个铁矿正在加速建设。
    这座人造富铁矿联合企业的设计和设备，基本上都是我国自行制作的。它是我国第一个五年计划以外新加的限额以上工程。
