Xinhua News Agency, August 19th: Materials provided by staff members of the Chinese Peking Union Medical College (PUMC) prove that the claim made by Li Zong'en, the president of PUMC and a bourgeois rightist, that PUMC "was better when it was run by the Americans, because the Communist Party's leadership is not good" is completely unfounded. These staff members said that PUMC has undergone fundamental changes since it was taken over by the people in 1951. These changes are manifested in the significant improvement of the staff members' political ideology, as well as in the great developments in medicine, teaching, research, and construction.

Many Staff Members Destroyed Pro-American and Worship-America Ideologies, and Their Political Awareness Continuously Improved

The former PUMC was one of the bastions of American imperialism's cultural aggression in China. People now call PUMC before 1951 "Old PUMC." During the "Old PUMC" period, many people's minds were permeated with pro-American, worship-America, and bourgeois ideologies. Since the takeover, the senior medical experts and other staff members of PUMC have experienced a series of political movements and democratic construction activities within the college, such as the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Campaigns, ideological remolding, and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. These movements destroyed pro-American and worship-America ideologies, clarified the distinction between the enemy and ourselves, and continuously improved political awareness. During the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, many people were proactive and diligent in their work, and nineteen professors and technicians were commended for their meritorious service. To date, fifteen outstanding senior medical experts have become glorious Communist Party members, and many others have actively applied to join the Chinese Communist Party.

In the Past, Patients Were Treated Only for the Wealthy Few; Now, the Volume of Medical Work Has Increased Significantly

The medical work of Old PUMC was promoted as "charity." At that time, whether poor patients could receive treatment or be hospitalized often depended on whether the patient's illness suited the interests and requirements of the doctors at the time. Doctors often deliberately delayed the treatment and recovery time of patients with special diseases for "research." The number of patients who were sacrificed under this kind of "research" is impossible to count. After PUMC was taken over by the people, it truly served the people, and thus the volume of medical work has greatly increased. Currently, the number of beds in PUMC has increased from 198 at the time of the takeover to 523. "Old PUMC" mainly treated the wealthy few. The average number of hospitalized patients per year was 4,752. After liberation, the service targets of PUMC expanded, and the number of hospitalized patients in the first half of this year alone reached 4,656. The number of outpatient visits in 1956 also increased by approximately 250 visits per day compared to 1934-1935, when "Old PUMC" had the highest number of patients in its history.

Patient Mortality Rate Has Decreased from 8.3% in the Past to 3.3%

In recent years, the quality of medical care at the Chinese PUMC has also been continuously improving. The patient mortality rate in 1956 decreased from 8.3% in 1934-1935 to 3.3%. Since 1951, no one has died from surgery among the 211 patients with renal tuberculosis who underwent nephrectomy. New medical techniques and surgeries are also being continuously promoted in various departments. Many difficult and complicated diseases have been treated and cured at PUMC. Chinese PUMC has also made many contributions in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, as well as in supporting or cooperating with fraternal hospitals. The nursing work at Chinese PUMC has also been improved accordingly. Nurses provide meticulous and proactive care to patients. Some patients have even written letters after discharge to express their praise and gratitude.

Nearly a Thousand Medical Cadres Have Been Trained, and 114 Research Topics Have Been Completed

In 1952, under the leadership of the Health Department of the Military Commission, the Chinese PUMC decided that its main task was to undertake advanced education for cadres, based on the urgent need to improve medical cadres nationwide, as well as on PUMC's teaching strength and equipment conditions. In recent years, PUMC has trained 937 medical cadres through advanced training and short-term training courses, and has also trained 245 medical students. After returning to their original units from 120 medical units across the country, some trainees have carried out work that could not be done in the past, and some have taken on leadership roles in one area. "Old PUMC" only trained 310 people in 22 years. Although the research work of "Old PUMC" was relatively prominent in the backward China at that time, most of it was for the purpose of publishing articles or "science for science's sake." Therefore, the content of the research was divorced from the people and divorced from China's actual situation. After the takeover, the various departments of PUMC began to conduct research work in a planned manner from 1955, and completed 114 research topics in two years. According to incomplete statistics, the teaching staff of PUMC has published a total of 252 articles since the takeover. In 1954, Professor Wu Yingkai and Doctors Xu Xiufeng, Feng Chuanyi, and Bu Guoxuan conducted research on the medical treatment of war injuries, and conducted a year-long study on late-stage war injuries. They wrote many papers and field surgery lectures, laying a certain academic foundation for field surgery in China. Last year, the article "Diagnosis of Acute Inflammation of Heterotopic Appendix" published by Professor of Surgery Zeng Xianjiu and Lecturer Wu Weiran is of great guiding significance for avoiding misdiagnosis of atypical acute appendicitis.

Human Resources and Equipment Have Been Greatly Replenished

PUMC has been greatly replenished in terms of human resources and materials since the takeover. In recent years, ten cadres at or above the associate professor level have joined PUMC. The old instruments left by "Old PUMC" numbered 506, most of which were old. In recent years, 554 new instruments have been added. Many staff members have also made many instruments themselves. Foreign journals and magazines are one of the necessary conditions for conducting scientific research. This year, PUMC has subscribed to 1,011 types of journals and magazines, and the library has a collection of 2,481 types, while before the takeover, only 450 types were subscribed to each year, and the library only had a collection of 1,600 types.

Since September last year, the Chinese PUMC has been led by the Ministry of Health, with scientific research as its main task. Coordinating and cooperating with the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, it will develop into the center of medical scientific research in China. The lies fabricated by rightist elements such as Li Zong'en are obviously malicious.

    从美帝文化侵略堡垒变成人民医疗机构
    协和医学院解放后在医疗、教学、研究和建设等方面已经起了根本变化
    据新华社19日讯　根据中国协和医学院工作人员提供的材料证明：中国协和医学院院长、资产阶级右派分子李宗恩叫嚣协和医学院“没有美国人办的时候好，原因是共产党领导得不好”的说法，是毫无根据的。这些工作人员说，协和医学院在1951年为人民接管以后，已经起了根本的变化，它表现在工作人员们的政治思想已经有了显著的提高；在医疗、教学、研究和建设等方面，也都有了很大发展。
    许多工作人员摧毁了亲美、崇美思想，政治觉悟不断提高
    原来的协和医学院是美帝国主义在中国进行文化侵略的堡垒之一，现在人们把1951年以前的协和医学院叫做“旧协和”。“旧协和”时期，许多人的脑子里浸透了亲美、崇美思想和资产阶级思想。自接管后，协和医学院的高级医学专家和其他工作人员经历了三反、五反、思想改造、肃反等一系列的政治运动和学院内部的民主建制活动，摧毁了亲美、崇美思想，划清了敌我界限，政治觉悟不断提高。在抗美援朝斗争中，许多人在工作上表现主动、积极，不辞劳苦，有十九名教授和技术人员等立了功。到目前为止，已有十五名优秀的高级医学专家成了光荣的共产党员，还有不少人也积极申请加入中国共产党。
    过去是为少数有钱人治病，现在医疗工作量有很大增加
    旧协和的医疗工作是以“慈善”来标榜的。当时穷苦病人是否能得到治疗或住院，却常常取决于病人的病是否合乎当时大夫们的兴趣和要求。当时的大夫们为了“研究”，常常故意延迟对有些患特殊疾病的病人的治疗和痊愈的时间。在这种“研究”下而被牺牲了的病人，是无法统计的。协和医学院由人民接管后，才真正做到为人民服务，因而医疗工作量有了很大增长。目前，协和医学院的病床已由接管时的一百九十八张增加到五百二十三张。“旧协和”主要为少数有钱人治病，平均每年住院的病人是四千七百五十二人，解放后，协和服务对象扩大，今年上半年的住院人数就达到了四千六百五十六人。1956年门诊人次也比“旧协和”历史上病人最多的1934—1935年大约每天增加二百五十人次。
    病人死亡率由过去的8.3％降到3.3％
    几年来，中国协和医学院的医疗质量也在不断地提高。1956年病人死亡率已由1934—1935年的8.3％降低到3.3％，从1951年以来对二百一十一例肾结核病人施行的肾切除术，没有一人因手术死亡。新的医疗技术和手术也在各科不断地推广。许多疑难病症在协和医学院得到了治疗和痊愈。中国协和医学院在抗美援朝运动中，以及支援或同兄弟医院合作方面，也作出了许多贡献。中国协和医学院的护理工作也相应地作了改进。护士对病人护理做到细致、主动。有的病人出院后还来信表扬和表示感谢。
    培养了近千名医务干部，完成了一百十四个研究题目
    1952年，中国协和医学院在军委卫生部领导下，根据全国医务干部迫切需要提高，以及根据协和医学院的教学力量与设备条件，决定协和医学院主要是担负干部进修教育的任务。几年来，协和医学院通过进修和短期训练班等形式，培养了九百三十七名医务干部，还培养了二百四十五名医学生。来自全国各地一百二十个医疗单位的进修生回到原单位后，有的开展了过去不能进行的工作，有的担任了一方面的领导工作。“旧协和”在二十二年中仅培养了三百一十人。“旧协和”的研究工作，在当时落后的中国虽然是比较突出的，但多数是为了发表文章，或是“为科学而科学”，因此研究的内容是脱离人民，脱离中国实际情况的。接管后的协和医学院，各科从1955年开始有计划地进行研究工作，两年中完成了一百一十四个研究题目。据不完全统计，接管后协和医学院教学人员所发表的文章共有二百五十二篇。1954年，吴英恺教授和徐秀凤、冯传宜、卜国弦大夫等进行了战伤外科医疗的研究，对于晚期战伤进行了为时一年的研究，写成了许多论文和野战外科讲义，为我国的野战外科在学术上打下了一定的基础。去年，外科教授曾宪九和讲师吴蔚然发表的“对异位阑尾急性炎症的诊断”一文，对于避免误诊非典型急性阑尾炎具有重要的指导意义。
    人力和设备方面都有很大补充
    协和医学院接管后在人力和物资方面都得到了很大的补充。几年来有十位副教授级以上的干部参加了协和医学院工作。“旧协和”所遗留的仪器有五百零六件，大部是陈旧的，几年来添置的新仪器就有五百五十四件。许多工作人员还自制了很多器械，各国的期刊杂志是进行科学研究的必要条件之一。今年协和医学院订有一千零十一种，图书馆收藏的有两千四百八十一种，而接管前每年订购四百五十种，图书馆收藏的也只有一千六百种。
    中国协和医学院自去年9月改由卫生部领导后，以科学研究为主要任务，与中国医学科学院协调合作，将发展成为我国医学科学研究的中心。右派分子李宗恩等所制造的一片谎言，显然是别有用心的。
