Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 12th: During this summer vacation, the Chiang Kai-shek clique has forced over ten thousand young men and women from various parts of Taiwan to undergo "combat training," and to go to Kinmen and Penghu, etc., to "serve" the Chiang army and put on "consolation performances" in order to "boost morale."

In addition to conducting widespread anti-communist and anti-people indoctrination, the Chiang Kai-shek clique is also forcing some of these over ten thousand youths who are forced to participate in "combat training" to participate in various combat exercises.

Those forced to participate in "combat training" include university and high school students, ethnic minority youths, and overseas Chinese youths, as well as young Boy Scouts. These youths and adolescents are subjected to great suffering during training. According to Taiwanese newspapers, Mao A-jin, a well-known female youth from a Taiwanese ethnic minority, was forced to participate in the so-called "military service team" despite suffering from a serious illness. Nearly a thousand Boy Scouts from Kaohsiung and other places who were forced to be transported to Penghu for training also saw some of their number fall ill. The food and lodging conditions for youths forced to train in various places are very poor. Newspapers say that students training in Hualien City are complaining incessantly.

    台湾万余青年
    被迫受“战斗训练”
    新华社广州12日电　今年暑假期间，蒋介石集团迫令台湾各地的一万多名青年男女，接受“战斗训练”，并且到金门和澎湖等地为蒋军“服务”和作“慰问表演”，以“鼓舞士气”。
    蒋介石集团对这一万多名被迫参加“战斗训练”的青年，除了普遍进行反共反人民的毒害教育以外，还强迫一部分青年参加各种战斗演习。
    被迫参加“战斗训练”的有大、中学校学生、少数民族青年和华侨青年，还有年少的童子军。这些青年和少年在受训中备受折磨。据台湾报纸透露，台湾少数民族中一个出名的女青年毛阿金，身害重病，也被迫带病参加所谓“军中服务队”。被迫运到澎湖去受训的高雄等地的近千名童子军，也有一部分人病倒。各地被迫受训的青年，食宿条件都非常恶劣。报纸说，在花莲市受训的学生人人叫苦连天。
