Xinhua News Agency, August 15th, New York dispatch: What is the current situation in the American literary scene? Some famous American writers and critics revealed some situations at the first national congress of writers and playwrights held by the Writers Union not long ago.

	Writers' Talents Have Nowhere to Be Displayed
	An important issue discussed by the four hundred delegates attending the conference was: Is there freedom of creation and democracy in the United States? The famous critic Brown gave a negative answer to this question in his speech. He said, "Although McCarthy is dead, there is no reason to believe that McCarthyism will not exist in the future under a new name or in another form (in the United States)." He said that the United States is pursuing a "brink of war policy," and "prosperity" is built on a military economy, and peace is not solid; under these circumstances, it is difficult to maintain "spiritual freedom."
	Brown pointed out that today in the United States "too many writers have compromised with the times," novels are experiencing "years of poor harvest," and drama is "harvesting even less."
	The historical novelist Catton also holds the same view. He said that the United States not only had an environment in the past that prevented writers from fully displaying their talents, and social and economic pressures that hindered writers' creation and forced them to follow principles that were incompatible with them, but "it is no exception now." He said that the monetary rewards, power, and social status that people who can write poetry, novels, or something else can obtain in the United States cannot keep up with those of the chairman of a large industrial company. And the writers who insist that the United States is the most perfect country of all countries receive much better rewards than those who think that the United States is still in some chaos and hope to loudly speak out about these chaotic phenomena. He pointed out that after the end of World War II, the requirement to maintain capitalist "orthodoxy" became very strong, and the United States was no longer willing to "entertain" ideas that were "not carefully examined." Writers who want to say what they want to say, writers who are unwilling to think "orthodoxly," may eventually have to discuss their past with some committees of Congress.
	The playwright Miller used his own personal experience to illustrate the situation of the American government limiting the democratic freedom of writers. He said, "For most of American history, the relationship between artists and government authorities can be said to be unsettling. The proportion of our colleagues who have been exiled and imprisoned, and accused of national crimes is larger than in any other profession."
	The famous black poet Langston Hughes especially pointed out the situation of black American writers suffering discrimination and insults in the United States. He said that the works of black writers are currently subject to special review. "Because they are black, they are often blacklisted."

	Writers' Labor is Not Respected
	Another topic discussed at the meeting was the life and creative motivation of writers.
	The historical novelist Catton said that what American publishers are desperately pursuing now are those books that have just appeared in the book catalog and are popular among readers; "It is often difficult for the works of beginner authors to find a place to be published... Therefore, writers often have to spend a lot of valuable time and energy trying to make a living before they can talk about writing."
	The famous playwright Hellman said that the most serious problem facing American writers today is that American society "is losing the respect it should have for writers' labor," and writers have begun to "compete with businessmen." Another famous playwright Hart also expressed the same view, saying that the history of the American Writers Union's activities for forty or fifty years is a "history of a long-term war with publishers and theater managers," "the characteristics of these forty or fifty years... are the full pursuit of profit."
	The television scriptwriter Arthur said very sadly, "Please look at me, what you see is less a writer and more an item registered on the Wall Street Exchange." He described how he started his writing career. He "was eager to write" and had already begun to write some short stories and even began to think about writing novels. But doing so made him get almost no income, and when he wanted to sell what he wrote, "despair came with it." As a result, he had to engage in writing television scripts for a "market that could not meet the demand."

	Pornographic Reading Materials Flood the Market
	The meeting also discussed the influence of psychiatry on American literature and art and the problem of the proliferation of yellow literature in the United States. Some romantic poets in the United States insisted that the reason why artists can "create" is because they have a "fixed idea," and some kind of "hostile force" "forces" them to "create." Bookstores and libraries are full of books written by so-called psycho-"analytical" writers, which analyze writers' works from the views of Freudianism and neo-Freudianism, from "sexual symbolism," "abnormal" views, and the like. Dr. Kubie, the so-called most famous psychoanalyst in the United States, also talked about this situation at the meeting, saying that American "artists seem to be creating in a certain realm between absolute reality and complete fantasy."
	The famous radio commentator Vander Cook mentioned that the United States is currently selling a large number of pornographic reading materials and as many "literary works" that are indistinguishable from pornography. In most cases, the covers that "decorate" low-priced publications (even classical works) are very attractive. The publishers of these books use images of naked or semi-naked women on the covers that are almost completely unrelated to the content of the books.

### 创作没有自由  生活没有保障  美国文艺界情况一团糟

    创作没有自由  生活没有保障
    美国文艺界情况一团糟
    据新华社15日讯  纽约消息：美国文艺界目前的情况是怎样的呢？美国一些著名作家和评论家在作家联盟不久前举行的作家和剧作家第一次全国代表大会上揭露了一些情况。
      作家才能无处发挥
    参加这个会议的四百名代表讨论的一个重要问题是：在美国有没有创作自由和民主？著名的评论家布朗在发言时对这个问题作了否定的回答。他说，“虽然麦卡锡已经离开人世，但是却没有理由认为麦卡锡主义今后不会以新的名称或者另一种形式（在美国）存在”。他说，美国正在奉行着“战争边缘政策”，“繁荣”建立在军事经济基础上，和平是不巩固的；在这种种情况下很难保持“精神上的自由”。
    布朗指出，今天美国“有太多的作家向时代妥协了”，小说正经历着“歉收的岁月”，而戏剧“歉收的更厉害”。
    历史小说家卡顿也持有同样的看法。他说，美国不但过去存在着使作家不能够充分发挥他们的天才的环境，存在着妨碍作家创造的和强迫作家遵循同他格格不入的准则的社会压力和经济压力，而且“现在也不例外”。他说，能够写诗、写小说或者写些其他什么东西的人，他所能得到的金钱报酬、势力和社会地位在美国是赶不上当大工业公司董事长的人的。而硬说在一切国家中美国是尽善尽美的一个国家的作家所得到的报酬又要比那些认为现在美国尚有些混乱并且希望大声疾呼地说出这些混乱现象的人得到的报酬要优厚得多。他指出，在第二次世界大战结束以后，保持资本主义“正统观念”的要求变得非常强烈，美国已经再不愿意“殷勤款待”那种“不经仔细审查”的思想了。想要说出自己想要说的话的作家，不愿意“正统地”思索的作家，到头来也可能迫不得已地与国会的一些委员会一起商讨自己的过去。
    剧作家米勒用他自己的切身经验说明了美国政府限制作家的民主自由的情况。他说，在“美国历史上的大部分时间内，艺术家和政府当局之间的关系可以说是使人不安的。我们的同行中被流放和监禁的，被指责为国家罪犯的人的比例比任何其他职业中都要大”。
    著名的黑人诗人兰斯顿·休斯特别指出美国黑人作家在美国受尽歧视和侮辱的情况。他说，黑人作家的作品目前要经过特别审查。“因为他们是黑人，所以常常被列入黑名单”。
      作家劳动无人尊重
    会议讨论的另一个题目是作家的生活和创作的动机。
    历史小说家卡顿说，目前美国的出版社拚命追求的是刚刚在图书目录中出现的在读者中间大受欢迎的那些书籍；“初学的作者的作品往往很难找到出版的地方……因此作家经常要用去许多宝贵时间和精力去设法谋求生活，而后才能谈到写作”。
    著名剧作家赫里蔓说，目前美国作家面临的最严重的问题是，美国社会“正在丧失对作家劳动应有的尊重”，而作家们已经开始“同商人竞赛”。另一个著名剧作家哈特也表示了同样的看法，他说，美国作家联盟四五十年来的活动史是一部“同出版商和剧院经理作长期战争的一部战争史”，“这四五十年的特点……是全力地追求利润”。
    电视剧本作家阿瑟十分沉痛地说，“请看看我，你们看到的与其说是作家，不如说是在华尔街交易所中登记的一个项目。”他叙述了他是如何开始自己的作家生涯的。他“曾渴望写作”，并且已经开始写一些短小的故事、甚至开始想写长篇小说。但是这样做使得他差不多没有得到什么收入，当他想出卖他所写的东西的时候，“绝望就跟着到来了”。结果他只好为一个“供不应求的市场”电视剧本从事写作。
      色情读物充斥市场
    会议也讨论了精神病学对美国文艺的影响和美国泛滥黄色文学的问题。美国一些浪漫派诗人们硬说，艺术家所以能“创作”，是因为他有一种“固定观念”，有某种
  “敌对力量”“强迫”他“创作”。书店和图书馆充斥着所谓心理“分析”作家创作的书籍，这些书是从弗洛伊德主义和新弗洛伊德主义观点，从“性的象征主义”，“反常”的观点以及诸如此类的观点来分析作家的作品。美国所谓最著名的心理分析专家居比博士在会上也谈到这种情况，他说，美国的“艺术家仿佛正在绝对现实和完全梦幻之间的某种境地进行创作”。
    著名的广播评论员范德考克提到，美国目前正在销售大量色情读物和同样多同色情难分彼此的“文学”。在大多数情况下，“装饰”低价发行的作品（甚至古典作品）的封面都带有很诱人注意的性质。这些书籍的出版者用对这些书的内容几乎完全无关的裸体或半裸体的女人像装饰封面。
