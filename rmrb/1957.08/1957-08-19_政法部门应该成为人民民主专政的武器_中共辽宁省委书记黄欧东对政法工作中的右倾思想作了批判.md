    Political and Legal Departments Should Become Weapons of the People's Democratic Dictatorship
    Huang Oudong, Secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee of the CPC, Criticizes Right-leaning Ideologies in Political and Legal Work

    (Our reporter Lu Hao) It is imperative to quickly and vigorously overcome right-leaning ideologies in political and legal departments, especially in the work of the Procuratorate, so that political and legal work truly becomes a powerful and sharp weapon for safeguarding the people's democratic dictatorship. This was stated by Huang Oudong, First Secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee of the CPC, at the Fourth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Provincial Party Committee, which concluded on the 14th of this month.

    In his speech on the political and legal work section, Huang Oudong focused on criticizing the right-leaning ideologies manifested in the work of the Liaoning Provincial Procuratorate. He said that the Liaoning Provincial Procuratorate's understanding of the principle of mutual restraint is very incomplete. Therefore, it not only fails to cooperate with other political and legal departments but sometimes plays a role in restraining and counteracting them. Our Procuratorate only emphasizes correcting unjust verdicts and does not pay attention to investigating omissions, which is not conducive to consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship. This situation must be fundamentally changed.

    The meeting conducted a serious criticism and self-criticism of the right-leaning ideologies existing in political and legal work. According to information reflected from various sources, the Liaoning Provincial Procuratorate has indeed done a lot of work in recent years; however, the right-leaning ideology in its work is also relatively serious. This is primarily manifested in the fact that some leading cadres of the Procuratorate have mistakenly understood the basic conclusion of the large-scale class struggle in the country as if the class struggle has already been extinguished. Therefore, the Procuratorate has shown numbness and lost vigilance in issues such as suppressing counter-revolutionaries and cracking down on criminal offenders. For example, the Shenyang Public Security Bureau discovered that criminal offenders in the North Market and South Station areas have been very rampant recently, but a responsible comrade of the city's Procuratorate took a jeep to look around and said there was no problem. Secondly, right-leaning ideology is manifested in the fact that some leading cadres of the Procuratorate have misinterpreted the principle of correctly handling contradictions among the people. Therefore, they fail to suppress those who should be suppressed and fail to arrest and prosecute those who should be arrested and prosecuted. Many cases are judged leniently for serious crimes, causing dissatisfaction among the people, while many leading cadres of the Procuratorate are indifferent and unmoved.

    Regarding the root causes of the right-leaning ideology in the Procuratorate, Huang Oudong said in his analysis that the main reason is that some leading cadres of our Procuratorate lack a correct assessment of the current political situation. They have long confined themselves to their offices, not contacting reality, not connecting with the masses, so they do not hear about some illegal and undisciplined things happening below and do not know about many improperly handled cases. This puts them in a very dangerous position. Huang Oudong continued: The struggle between the two roads—the socialist road and the capitalist road—in politics and ideology is unfolding intensely and deeply throughout the province. Political and legal work departments should, in accordance with the wishes of the people, strictly guard their positions and vigorously defend the achievements of socialism. Huang Oudong said: Political and legal departments, especially the provincial Procuratorate, should be determined to go deep among the masses, go deep into reality, and educate their cadres to humbly listen to the opinions of the masses in order to correct their mistakes more quickly. Huang Oudong also criticized the tendency of some political and legal departments to unilaterally emphasize the vertical system and attempt to break away from the leadership of the Party.

    政法部门应该成为人民民主专政的武器
    中共辽宁省委书记黄欧东对政法工作中的右倾思想作了批判
    本报讯　记者陆灏报道：必须迅速努力克服政法部门的，特别是检察院工作中的右倾思想，政法工作要真正成为维护人民民主专政的强大而锐利的武器。这是中共辽宁省委第一书记黄欧东在本月14日结束的省委第四次全体委员会议（扩大）上说的。
    黄欧东在关于政法工作部分的讲话中，着重地批判了辽宁省检察院工作中表现的右倾思想。他说，辽宁省检察院对互相制约的原则了解得很不全面，因此它不但不能和其他政法部门共同配合作战，反而有时候起了牵制和抵消的作用。我们的检察院只强调查冤，不注意查漏，这就不是有利于巩固人民民主专政的，这种情况一定要从根本上加以改变。
    会议对于政法工作中存在的右倾思想进行了严正的批评和自我批评。据各方面反映的情况来看，辽宁省检察院几年来的确做了很多工作；但是工作中的右倾思想也是比较严重的。这首先表现在某些检察院的领导干部把国内大规模的阶级斗争基本结束，错误地理解为阶级斗争好像已经熄灭了。因此在肃反、打击刑事犯等等问题上，检察院表现了麻木不仁，丧失了警惕。如沈阳市公安局发现北市场、南站的刑事犯，最近很嚣张，而该市检察院的一位负责同志坐了吉普车去看了一遍，却说没有问题。其次，右倾思想表现在某些检察院的领导干部曲解了对于正确处理人民内部矛盾的原则。因此，他们对待应该镇压的，不予镇压；应该逮捕法办的，不予逮捕法办。很多案件，重罪轻判，引起了人民群众的不满；而检察院的不少领导干部却不闻不问，无动于衷。
    关于检察院的右倾思想产生的根源问题，黄欧东在分析时说，主要是我们检察院的某些领导干部，对于目前的政治形势缺乏正确的估计。他们长期把自己关在办公室里，不接触实际，不联系群众，因此对于下边某些违法乱纪的事情听不到，对于很多处理不当的案件也不知道。这样，就使自己陷于一种非常危险的地步。黄欧东接着说：政治上、思想上的两条道路——社会主义道路和资本主义道路的斗争，正在全省激烈地深入地展开，政法工作部门应该按照人民的愿望，严守自己的阵地，有力地捍卫社会主义的成果。黄欧东说：政法部门，目前特别是省的检察院，应该下决心深入群众，深入实际，应该教育自己的干部虚心地听听群众的意见，才能更迅速改正自己的错误。黄欧东对于有些政法部门片面强调垂直系统，企图脱离党的领导的倾向，也进行了批评。
