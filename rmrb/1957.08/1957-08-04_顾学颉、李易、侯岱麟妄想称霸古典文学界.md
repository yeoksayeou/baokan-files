Gu Xuejie, Li Yi, and Hou Dailin Fantasize About Dominating the Classical Literature Circle

    (Our newspaper reports) According to the Beijing Daily, staff members of the People's Literature Publishing House exposed and counterattacked the frantic attacks on the Party by rightist elements Gu Xuejie, Li Yi, and Hou Dailin (all members of the Jiusan Society) in the classical literature editorial office of the publishing house.

    In early May, when the rectification movement had just begun, Gu Xuejie launched an attack by slandering the classical literature editorial office of the People's Literature Publishing House as being in a state of "paralysis and disunity." He said that this was the result of the anti-Rightist movement. Hou Dailin even sang the tune that "the anti-Rightist campaign is a ‘new rendition of Cao Cao's release’, determined to make everyone a counter-revolutionary." Gu Xuejie and Li Yi echoed each other, saying, "The state purchase and marketing system has messed things up." "The rectification movement is like sending officials to the countryside; the peasants will pick up their carrying poles." After the people of the whole country refuted Ge Peiqi to the point of utter disgrace, Gu Xuejie brazenly defended Ge, affirming that "Communists are killable."

    During the rectification movement, Gu, Li, and Hou used various despicable means to recruit people and start fires everywhere, using the legal Jiusan Society organization to carry out illegal conspiracies. With the vile style of old society politicians, they recruited people to join the Jiusan Society, saying that the Jiusan Society does not emphasize ideological transformation, and it is okay not to attend meetings; now it is about "helping with the rectification movement." They attempted to immediately establish a Jiusan Society group to create political capital and use it to attack the Party even more ferociously.

    In order to attack the Party's leadership, Gu Xuejie falsely accused the Party branch of "acting in self-interest and plotting to frame people." He said: The Party is worse than the fatuous emperors of feudal times, and Party members are all "mediocre people." To join the Party, one must first become a block of wood, flattering and obsequious. Hou Dailin also slandered, saying, "New Party members are all those who got in by bootlicking." The ultimate purpose of these slanders was the slogan proposed by Gu Xuejie: "Bring back the talented, and let the mediocre study," dreaming of negating achievements and achieving the goal of usurping the Party's leadership.

    Gu, Li, Hou, and others also fantasized about erasing the achievements of the Party's leadership in classical literature publishing.

    The ambitions of these rightist elements were not limited to usurping the leadership of the classical literature editorial office of the People's Literature Publishing House; they further proposed the slogan "To shoot a man, shoot his horse first; to capture the bandits, capture their chief first; first shoot He Qifang, then capture Guo Moruo," attempting to seize the world of classical literature. Under the control of this ambition, they further extensively contacted people inside and outside the publishing house, attempting to create an "authoritative journal" of classical literature—"Yiwen Zhi Quarterly," wanting to "enlist classical literature talents from all over the country," even including Wang Jingwei's secretary, but refusing to accept a single Communist Party member. Their painstaking efforts were the same as Zhang Bojun's desire to run the "China Forum." When they formally proposed it to the leaders of the People's Literature Publishing House, they claimed that "the Propaganda Department has already agreed," requesting to establish a publishing relationship with the publishing house, while vigorously soliciting manuscripts, attempting to use this magazine to overwhelm the two publications led by the Party, "Literary Research" and "Literary Heritage." Later, after inquiring with the Propaganda Department, it was not the case. They were originally Li Wanming's disciples, and they played a deceptive trick.

    The masses are now continuing to expose and criticize these rightist elements.

    顾学颉、李易、侯岱麟妄想称霸古典文学界
    本报讯　据北京日报报道：人民文学出版社工作人员揭发和反击了该社古典文学编辑室编辑右派分子顾学颉、李易、侯岱麟（都是九三学社成员）等人对党的猖狂进攻。
    5月上旬，整风运动刚开始时，顾学颉是以污蔑人民文学出版社古典文学编辑室“形成瘫痪状态、人心思散”的论调发起攻击的。他说，这是肃反运动带来的结果。侯岱麟更高唱“肃反是一出‘新捉放曹’，非要把每个人都搞成反革命不可”。顾学颉和李易一唱一和地说“统购统销搞糟了。”“整风如下放，农民就要拿起扁担来。”当全国人民把葛佩琦批驳得体无完肤之后，顾学颉还明目张胆地为葛辩护，肯定“共产党员是可杀的”。
    顾、李、侯在整风期间施展各种卑劣手段到处拉人放火，利用合法的九三学社组织，进行非法的阴谋活动。他们以旧社会政客的恶劣作风拉人加入九三学社，说九三学社不强调思想改造，不去开会也可以，现在就是“帮助整风”。他们企图立即成立一个九三学社的小组，造成政治资本，借以更凶恶地向党进攻。
    顾学颉为了攻击党的领导，诬称党支部“假公济私，阴谋陷害”。他说：党比封建时代的昏君还不如，党员都是“庸才”，要想入党，首先得变成木头，阿谀奉承，唯唯诺诺。侯岱麟也诽谤地说：“新党员都是拍马屁拍上去的”。他们这些污蔑的最后目的，就是顾学颉提出的“人才归队、庸才学习”的口号，梦想否定成绩，达到篡夺党的领导的目的。
    顾、李、侯等人还妄想抹煞党领导的古典文学出版工作的成绩。
    这些右派分子的野心，不只是篡夺人民文学出版社古典文学编辑室的领导权，他们更提出了“射人先射马，擒贼先擒王；先射何其芳，后擒郭沫若”的口号，企图要坐古典文学的天下。在这种野心的支配下，他们进一步在社内外大肆联络，企图创办一个古典文学的“权威杂志”——“艺文志季刊”，想要“网罗全国的古典文学人才”，甚至连汪精卫的秘书也包括在内，但是就不肯收容一个共产党员。其用心良苦，和章伯钧要办“中华论坛”同出一辙。当他们向人民文学出版社领导正式提出来的时候，声称“中宣部已经同意”，要求和社方建立出版关系，同时大肆组稿，企图用这个杂志来压倒党领导的“文学研究”、“文学遗产”两个刊物。后来向中宣部了解，并不是这么回事。他们原来是李万铭的徒弟，干了一场骗人的把戏。
    现在群众正在继续揭露和批判这些右派分子。
