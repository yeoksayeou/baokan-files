Wu Zuguang is Still Putting on Makeup
Film and Theater Circles Hold Meeting to Warn Him Not to Seek His Own Destruction

(Our Newspaper) Theatrical and film circles held a meeting on the 16th with more than 200 people to criticize the rightist Wu Zuguang. Wu Zuguang once again tried to muddle through with empty confessions at the meeting, arousing the unanimous anger of those present.

He Jingzhi pointed out: Wu Zuguang put a very big hat on himself in his speech, using a series of adjectives to denounce himself as "insidious, ugly, and cunning," "the most ugly and dirty typical bourgeois rightist," "a double-dealer," "a bully," "thoroughly reactionary," and so on. He also admitted to the "Second-Rate Hall" and the "small family," but he just wouldn't confess to specific facts. He actually only dressed himself up as a somewhat bourgeois individualist and liberal intellectual. He even portrayed himself as having certain cute and pitiful aspects. He Jingzhi said: Wu Zuguang is deceiving us, he has not yet resolved to surrender to the people! He Jingzhi solemnly warned Wu Zuguang: If he does not thoroughly expose his dark inner world of anti-Party and anti-socialist sentiment, and confess all the facts of the anti-Party activities of the right-wing group headed by him, he will not be able to get through this.

Li Zhihua said: Wu Zuguang is a political "double-dealer." Wu Zuguang used to collude with landlords, hooligans, and secret agents, and has never broken ties with them. He also actually gathered the remnants of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, inherited Hu Feng's reactionary mantle in literature and art, and tried to reverse the verdict on the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique! Recently, right-wing elements in literary and art circles have launched a frenzied attack on the Party in several areas, and Wu Zuguang is the commander-in-chief of one "army." In order to defend the socialist cause of literature and art, we must make Wu Zuguang make a thorough confession this time!

In the past, Wu Zuguang attacked the Chinese Opera School the most fiercely. Sun Shengwen, a teacher at the school, used irrefutable facts at the meeting to denounce this rightist for "speaking blindly with his eyes closed." He said that Wu Zuguang boasted that he had old acquaintances with the Fu Liancheng opera troupe, saying how badly today's opera school is run and how good the old opera troupe was. Then, does he know how Liu Shenglians died? Zhao Shengbao and Xiao Shengrui were both good students in the fourth class, so why did they die on the streets of Tianjin back then! He also refuted Wu Zuguang's vicious instigation of the relationship between veteran artists and the Party. Famous actors Qiu Shengrong and Li Yilan also used their personal experiences to denounce Wu Zuguang's vicious slander of the opera cause.

Qian Ganrong, a student at Peking University, exposed Wu Zuguang's anti-Party activities among college students at the meeting. Peking University students invited Wu Zuguang twice to introduce his writing experience. Wu Zuguang took the opportunity to traffic in private goods and spread poison to the students. He promoted his student life as a young master who skipped school to watch operas, slandered the current education system for "restricting" students, and making students "lacking in knowledge." Wu Zuguang said: "Today's college students are simply like middle school students, middle school students are like elementary school students, and elementary school students are like college students (because they have to present flowers, hold meetings, and welcome foreign guests)." Wu Zuguang's words had an extremely bad influence, and many students became his prisoners. Some students in the Chinese Department felt that they could not write because the school system "restricted" them, and they demanded "freedom of action." Some students even proposed the slogan "Cancel political courses as required courses." Wu Zuguang also promoted to Peking University students that the current film level is too low, saying that the current directors are not as good as his script supervisor in Hong Kong.

Ma Lu, Hu Sha and others also spoke at the meeting.

Tian Han said in his final speech: Wu Zuguang will not be able to pass this "checkpoint" if he is not honest like this. The debate will continue. Wu Zuguang should stop playing tricks and trying to figure out the bottom line. The bottom line is not with us, but with himself. The Party's policy is very clear: as long as right-wing elements make a thorough confession and correct their mistakes, the people will definitely save them, and they can still serve socialism again. If he refuses to confess, what awaits him is a self-destructive future. (Attached picture)

### 吴祖光还在给自己擦粉  影剧界集会正告他不要自寻绝路

    吴祖光还在给自己擦粉
    影剧界集会正告他不要自寻绝路
    本报讯  戏剧界、电影界人士二百多人16日集会，批判右派分子吴祖光。吴祖光在会上又一次以空空洞洞的交代来搪塞，激起了到会者一致的愤怒。
    贺敬之指出：吴祖光在发言中给自己戴了很大的帽子，用了一连串形容词，痛骂自己是“阴险的、丑恶的、狡猾的”、“最丑最脏的资产阶级右派分子的典型”、“两面派”“恶霸”“十足的反动思想”等等，也承认了“二流堂”“小家族”，但就是不交代具体事实。他实际只把自己打扮成为一个有些资产阶级个人主义和自由主义的文人罢了。他甚至还把自己描写得有某些可爱可怜之处。贺敬之说：吴祖光是在欺蒙我们，他还没有决心向人民投降！贺敬之严正忠告吴祖光：他若不彻底地揭露他反党反社会主义的黑暗的内心世界，交代以他为首的右派集团的反党活动的全部事实，他是休想过关的。
    李之华说：吴祖光是一个政治上的“两面派”。吴祖光从前和地主、流氓、特务勾结一起，一直没有和他们割断联系。他又实际集中了胡风反革命集团的残部，继承胡风在文艺上的反动衣钵，为胡风反革命集团翻案！最近以来，文艺界的右派分子在几个方面向党发动猖狂进攻，吴祖光是一个“方面军”的总指挥。为了捍卫社会主义的文艺事业，我们这一次一定要吴祖光彻底交代！
    过去吴祖光攻击得最凶的是中国戏曲学校。这个学校的教员孙盛文在会上用无可辩驳的事实痛斥这个右派分子“闭着眼瞎说”。他说吴祖光自夸同富连成科班有故交，说今天的戏校怎么办得坏，旧科班怎么好，那末，他可知道刘盛连们是怎么死的？赵盛璧、萧盛瑞都是四科的好学生，为什么当年死在天津卫的马路上！他又驳斥吴祖光恶毒地挑拨老艺人和党的关系。著名演员裘盛戎和李忆兰也用亲身经历痛斥吴祖光向戏曲事业的恶毒诬蔑。
    北京大学学生钱淦荣在会上揭发了吴祖光在大学生中进行的反党活动。北大学生曾两次请吴祖光去介绍写作经验。吴祖光却趁机向学生贩运私货，散布毒素。他向同学们宣传自己少年时候逃学去看戏的公子哥儿式的学生生活，污蔑现行教育制度“束缚”学生，使学生“知识十分缺乏”。吴祖光说：“现在的大学生简直像中学生，中学生像小学生，小学生倒像大学生（因为要献花、开会、迎接外宾）”。吴祖光的话起了极其恶劣的影响，不少同学作了他的俘虏。中文系有些同学就觉得，他们写不出东西，是由于学校制度“束缚”住了，要求“自由行动”，有的学生还提出了“取消政治课为必修课”的口号。吴祖光还向北大学生宣传现在的电影水平太低，说现在的导演还不如他在香港时候的场记。
    在会上发言的，还有马路、胡沙等人。
    田汉在最后发言说：吴祖光这样不老实，是过不了“关”的。辩论会还要开下去。吴祖光不要再耍花招，摸底了。底，不在我们而在他自己。党的政策，很明确的，右派分子只要彻底交代，改正错误，人民一定会挽救他，他还可以重新为社会主义服务。如果拒不交代，等着他的是自取毁灭的前途。（附图片）
