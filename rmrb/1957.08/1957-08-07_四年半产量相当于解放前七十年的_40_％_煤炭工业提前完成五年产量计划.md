Xinhua News Agency, 6th. China's coal industry has reached the last year's raw coal production level of the first Five-Year Plan five months ahead of schedule. According to preliminary statistics from the State Statistical Bureau, by the end of July, the national cumulative annual raw coal production had reached 114.105 million tons (excluding raw coal produced by handicrafts), exceeding the planned annual output of 1957 stipulated in the Five-Year Plan by 1.12 million tons; an increase of 50.577 million tons compared to the actual output in 1952; equivalent to more than 1.8 times the total coal output of 61.875 million tons in 1942, the highest production year in history before liberation.

In the first four years and seven months of the first Five-Year Plan, the cumulative output of raw coal was more than 410 million tons, which is equivalent to 40% of the total coal output (approximately 1.1 billion tons) in the seventy years from 1878, when the first mechanically hoisted mine was built in Kaiping, to the eve of the national liberation in 1949.

The commissioning of a large number of newly built, renovated, and restored mines is an important factor in the rapid development of China's coal industry. From 1953 to the first half of this year, the newly added production capacity due to the commissioning of a large number of mines across the country was 48.31 million tons, accounting for 61% of the total coal mine production capacity at the end of 1952. Among these newly added mines, in addition to eight of the most modern large-scale mines designed with the help of the Soviet Union, such as the Xing'an Platform of Hegang and the Ping'an Vertical Shaft of Fuxin, most of the others are small and medium-sized mines, so they can generally achieve the goal of low investment and rapid coal production. The commissioning of these mines has not only increased the production capacity of raw coal and extended the exploitation life of many existing production mines, but also changed the imbalance between regional supply and demand left over from old China. For example, the coal production in the Northwest and Southwest regions, which used to produce very little coal, will increase by two to three times this year compared with 1952, thereby creating favorable conditions for the development of industry and transportation in these regions.

While carrying out capital construction of a large number of mines, many existing production mines have also undergone comprehensive production reforms, increasing lifting, transportation, ventilation, and mining equipment, adopting advanced mining methods, and tapping production potential. Among them, calculated by the mines under the Ministry of Coal Industry, which account for more than 80% of the country's coal production, the proportion of using longwall and other new mining methods in the first half of this year accounted for 92.8% of the total coal production, an increase of 19.33% compared with 1952. Due to the implementation of this new mining method, the coal recovery rate has also increased from 76% in 1952 to 83.34%, exceeding the provisions of the first Five-Year Plan. Calculated by this item alone, the coal resources lost in the first half of this year were more than 4 million tons less than in 1952. At the same time, the production efficiency of coal mines in various places has also been greatly improved compared with the past. In the first half of this year, the average raw coal produced by each worker in a state-owned coal mine per working day increased by 0.344 tons compared with 1952, more than one and a half times higher than in 1949.

With the construction, renovation, and technical transformation of many mines, the production conditions underground in coal mines have been greatly improved. The degree of mechanization of coal transportation underground in state-owned coal mines has now reached more than 80%; the situation of heavy hand-picked coal mining, which was used extensively before liberation, basically no longer exists. About 35% of the coal was mined by pure mechanization in the first half of this year. At the same time, most coal mines have adopted mechanical ventilation, and 92% of the working faces in state-owned coal mines can get more than three cubic meters of fresh air per worker per minute.

### 四年半产量相当于解放前七十年的40％  煤炭工业提前完成五年产量计划

    四年半产量相当于解放前七十年的40％
    煤炭工业提前完成五年产量计划
    新华社6日讯　我国煤炭工业提前五个月达到了第一个五年计划最后一年的原煤产量水平。据国家统计局初步统计，到7月底，全国累计一年的原煤产量已经达到一万一千四百一十点五万吨（不包括手工业原煤产量，下同），超过五年计划中规定的1957年全年产量一百一十二万吨；比1952年实际产量增加五千零五十七点七万吨；相当于解放前历史上产量最高的一年——1942年全部煤产量六千一百八十七点五万吨的一点八倍多。
    在第一个五年计划的前四年又七个月中，原煤的累计产量共四亿一千多万吨，即相当于旧中国自1878年在开平开始建设第一对机械提升的矿井起，直到1949年全国解放前夕七十多年中全部煤产量（约十一亿吨左右）的40％。
    几年来大批新建、改建和恢复的矿井投入生产，是我国煤炭工业迅速发展的重要因素。从1953年到今年上半年，全国由于大批矿井投入生产而新增加的生产能力有四千八百三十一万吨，为1952年底全部煤矿生产能力的61％。在这些新增加的矿井中，除了鹤岗兴安台、阜新平安立井等八处是由苏联帮助我国设计的最现代化的大型矿井以外，其余大部分是中小型的矿井，因而一般都能达到投资少、出煤快的目的。由于这些矿井的投入生产，不仅增加了原煤的生产能力，延长了许多原有生产矿井的开采寿命，而且改变了旧中国遗留下来的地区供需不平衡的现象。如过去产煤很少的西北和西南两个地区，今年的煤炭产量就将比1952年提高二倍到三倍，从而为这些地区的工业和交通运输业的发展，创造了有利的条件。
    与大批矿井进行基本建设的同时，许多原有生产矿井也都进行了全面的生产改革，增加了提升、运输、通风、采掘等设备，采用先进的采煤方法，发挥了生产潜力。其中以占全国煤炭产量80％以上的煤炭工业部所属各矿计算，今年上半年采用长壁式等新法采煤的比重，就占全部煤炭产量92.8％，比1952年增加19.33％。由于这种新采煤法的推行，煤的回采率也从1952年的76％提高到83.34％，超过了第一个五年计划的规定。仅这一项计算，今年上半年少丢失的煤炭资源，比1952年减少了四百多万吨。同时各地煤矿的生产效率也比过去大大提高。今年上半年平均每个国营煤矿工人一个工作日生产的原煤，媲1952年增加零点三四四吨，比1949年提高一倍半以上。
    随着许多矿井的新建、改建和进行技术改造，目前煤矿井下的生产条件有了很大的改善。国营煤矿现在井下的运煤机械化程度，已经达到80％以上；解放前大量使用的笨重的手镐采煤的情况，基本上已经不存在了。今年上半年35％左右的煤是用纯机械化开采的。同时绝大多数煤矿都采用了机械通风，国营煤矿中92％的工作面每个工人每分钟能得到三立方公尺以上的新鲜空气。
