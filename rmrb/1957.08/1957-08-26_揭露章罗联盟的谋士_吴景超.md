Exposing Wu Jingchao, a Strategist of the Zhang-Luo Alliance
　　Xu Zhengfan

The rightist general Wu Jingchao was the leading figure in the Zhang-Luo Alliance's think tank. He participated in formulating the alliance's anti-socialist strategic plan and strived to implement it.

We know that the Zhang-Luo Alliance's anti-socialist strategy was: First, taking advantage of the Party's rectification movement, under the guise of "criticism," "supervision," and "contention," to set fires everywhere in the scientific, cultural, and educational circles, inciting teachers to lead students to the streets; second, to extend the fire to small merchants and vendors, so that students and citizens on the streets would unite, creating a chaotic situation; finally, under the banner of "cleaning up the mess," to make a pretentious appearance, attempting to replace the Communist Party and restore capitalism.

This vicious strategic plan, though only fully exposed recently, had long been the subject of efforts by the members of the Zhang-Luo Alliance to create conditions for its implementation before the great "blooming" and "contending." In this regard, Wu Jingchao certainly would not lag behind his "alliance brothers." Several major events are cited below as proof.

　　First Established "Meritorious Service"

First, to realize the anti-Party, anti-socialist conspiracy, bourgeois right-wing elements must control their organizations, turning them into bases for combat. Wu Jingchao had already recognized the significance of seizing the China Democratic League (CDL) into the hands of the Zhang-Luo Alliance. To control the CDL, the key lay in whether the right-wing within the League could unite, win over the centrists, and squeeze out the left-wing. To this end, Mr. and Mrs. Wu personally stepped forward, in their capacity as old friends of thirty years, to "earnestly advise" Luo Longji to maintain a good relationship with Zhang Bojun. Luo demonstrated his acceptance of this advice with practical actions. In the process of establishing this reactionary alliance, Wu Jingchao first established "meritorious service."

After the establishment of the Zhang-Luo Alliance, right-wing elements began to exclude the left-wing. In the process of implementing this conspiracy, Wu Jingchao's
  "merits" were equally undeniable. He participated in the grand chorus attacking Deng Chumin, cursing him as a "dogmatist"; participated in the offensive against the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CDL, attempting to drive away Wu Han and install Zeng Zhaolun; carried out the work of reorganizing the CDL Central Committee's Culture and Education Committee into a Culture and Education Department, getting rid of Chu Tunan and promoting Fei Xiaotong, with Wu Jingchao also internally designated as the first deputy minister.

In short, a series of "contributions" enabled Wu Jingchao, who had only been a member of the League for five years, to rise from a general member to a member of the CDL Central Committee's Culture and Education Committee, to a Central Committee member and Deputy Director of the Study Committee, and to be internally designated as the chief deputy minister of the Culture and Education Department, and to represent the CDL at the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). Truly, his official career was thriving, and he rose rapidly. This was the "reward" that the Zhang-Luo Alliance gave to its loyal strategist.

　　Building a Political Army for the Right-Wing

Second, in order to build an anti-socialist political army, Wu Jingchao and his comrades started from two aspects. On the one hand, they prepared to develop the organization of the China Democratic League at high speed. Zhang and Luo clamored to absorb one or two million new League members, to abolish the "defense zone system," so as to gather all those backward elements in various classes and strata who were dissatisfied with the new China. Wu Jingchao used his authority as the chairman of the CDL branch at the Renmin University of China (RUC) to try to implement the organizational line of the Zhang-Luo Alliance. He advocated breaking through the CDL's limit of only developing "upper-middle" (professors, lecturers) intellectuals, to find development targets among teaching assistants and over-aged Communist Youth League members, so as to have successors and "coexist for a long time" with the Communist Party. Thus, he recently developed right-wing elements such as Xu Mengxiong and Wang Yanzhen, and regarded Ge Peiqi, He An and other monsters and demons as objects for contact and cultivation.

On the other hand, he flattered the backward elements in the old intellectual circles and attacked the worker-peasant intellectuals. Luo Longji's two speeches, "My Understanding and Opinions on the Problems of Senior Intellectuals" and "Strengthening the Unity between Party and Non-Party Intellectuals," and Fei Xiaotong's two articles, "The Early Spring Weather of Intellectuals" and "'Early Spring' Before and After," fully exposed the Zhang-Luo Alliance's schemes in this regard. Wu Jingchao was one of the drafters of these four stinking articles. It can be seen that he played such an important role on this front.

It should also be pointed out that in order to win over the backward elements in the old intellectual circles, Wu Jingchao shamelessly applied powder and rouge to these people. He described them as perfect, believing that emphasizing ideological remolding was completely superfluous for this group of people. For example, he praised the right-wing element Li Jinghan to the sky. In the work of the CDL branch at the RUC, he consistently disregarded the ideological remolding of the League members, telling them: You must produce at least two scientific papers a year; everything else (referring to political study, ideological remolding) is nonsense. The reason why he was hostile to ideological remolding work was nothing more than fearing that the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of old intellectuals would be raised in the process of ideological remolding, thus undermining the foundation of the Zhang-Luo Alliance and hindering the establishment of their political army.

In order to gradually realize the anti-socialist strategic plan of the Zhang-Luo Alliance, he also suggested to Zhang and Luo face-to-face that a policy committee composed of various experts (i.e., old intellectuals) should be established in addition to the National People's Congress and the National Committee of the CPPCC, in order to cancel the Party's decision-making power. This suggestion was adopted by Zhang and Luo and developed into the notorious "Political Design Institute" and "Rehabilitation Committee."

Even more viciously, Wu Jingchao clamored everywhere, saying that there were two major difficulties in realizing "mutual supervision" and "hundred schools of thought contend": the first was the lack of their own news agency, and the second was the lack of data. Therefore, he advocated that democratic parties must have a news agency that could compete with the Xinhua News Agency, and fiercely criticized China's secrecy system as a feudal policy of deceiving the people, demanding that all confidential materials be made public to facilitate their attack on socialism.

　　Attempting to Restore Bourgeois Sociology

Third, at the symposium convened by "Contention" magazine in March this year, Wu Jingchao proposed that "it would be best to link the contention of a hundred schools of thought with the task of mutual supervision." This revealed his attempt to give academic contention the content of political struggle, so that bourgeois right-wingers could smuggle various private goods to occupy political positions and ideological fronts. Here, his conspiracy to oppose Marxism-Leninism and restore bourgeois sociology is cited as evidence.

In January this year, Wu Jingchao published a short article entitled "Does Sociology Still Have a Place in New China?" launching a tentative attack on Marxism-Leninism. On June 9, at the so-called "First Meeting of the Sociology Work Preparatory Committee," Wu actually took the lead in proposing to open a sociology department, and put forward a specific plan to establish departments in universities in the four major cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chengdu, stipulating that in Beijing, the RUC's Social Investigation and Research Office, the Central University for Nationalities, and Peking University should be used as strongholds for the restoration of sociology.

To restore bourgeois sociology, it is inevitable to oppose China's guiding ideology, Marxism-Leninism. Wu Jingchao smeared Marxism-Leninism as "dogmatism," cursed that "it has affected the world view of many people," and accused Marxists-Leninists of "blindly believing" in Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin and not daring to "criticize" their works, not daring to overthrow these "idols," thus becoming "dogmatists."

Everyone knows that the fundamental difference between Marxism-Leninism and dogmatism lies in their different attitudes towards practice. Wu Jingchao actually proposed to use whether one dares to oppose the classical writers of Marxism-Leninism as the dividing line between Marxism-Leninism and dogmatism. This way of posing the question exactly exposed that Wu Jingchao was originally committing the atrocity of murdering Marxism-Leninism under the guise of opposing so-called "dogmatism."

Wu Jingchao's words and deeds against Marxism-Leninism and restoring bourgeois sociology were not simply academic propositions and activities, but were making ideological and cadre preparations for the implementation of the Zhang-Luo Alliance's anti-socialist strategic plan.
  Taking the Lead in Firing on the School Party Committee System

Fourth, usurping the Party's leadership in the scientific, cultural, and educational circles was the first component of the Zhang-Luo Alliance's anti-socialist strategic plan, and controlling the universities was the first link in this component. Therefore, they felt that it was necessary to remove the bastion of the Party committee system. So Wu Jingchao took the lead in firing on the Party committee system.

As early as after the Party put forward "long-term coexistence, mutual supervision" last year, Wu Jingchao flaunted everywhere his set of various committees brought from the old Tsinghua University. On the one hand, he touted the superiority of his school affairs meetings, finance committees, personnel committees, etc., and on the other hand, he cursed that the Party committee system in universities had "insider information," "unspeakable things," and was "arbitrary and dictatorial," violating the spirit of Article 17 of China's Constitution. He wanted others to "logically" draw the conclusion that his set of committees must be used to replace the Party committee system.

Wu Jingchao's plan to subvert the Party committee system mainly had three poisonous schemes. First, any suggestions of the Party in the university must be based on the materials obtained from "Wu's" various committees' "investigation and research." Second, the suggestions put forward by the Party committee would only have legal effect and be ordered by the school administration to be implemented after being submitted to and passed by the school affairs meeting. Third, the CDL branch in each university (in fact, referring to the Zhang-Luo Alliance branch), through the reports of "League members" distributed in various committees, would understand and grasp the situation of the entire school, so as to replace the Party committee. In this way, under the combined attack, encirclement, and flanking attack of various large and small committees, the leadership of the Communist Party of China in universities would be "disintegrated" and eliminated completely. If Wu Jingchao's "wishful thinking" was realized, then naturally there would appear a feudal-style "headmaster ruling the school," a small handful of right-wing professors would monopolize everything in the school, run rampant, and use the universities as a hotbed for nurturing capitalism and a cadre manufacturing plant for the Zhang-Luo Alliance.

Because of the battle merit of firing the first shot against the Party committee system in universities, Wu Jingchao was assigned by the Zhang-Luo Alliance as one of the leaders of the group to eliminate the "Party committee responsibility system." It was in this group that the reactionary program "Our Suggestions on the Leadership System of Universities (Draft Manuscript)" was born. In this program, his shameless slanders against the Party committee system were further concretized; his ideas of establishing various committees were further developed. No wonder the drafter of this program, Huang Yaomian, had to declare that his "masterpiece" was mainly produced by synthesizing the views of Wu Jingchao and Tao Dayong.

　　Before and After the "June 6th" Conspiracy Meeting

Fifth, attending the "June 6th" conspiracy meeting as a strategist of the Zhang-Luo Alliance was the peak of Wu Jingchao's anti-Party and anti-socialist activities. This meeting was a meeting where bourgeois political careerists studied "the current situation and the tasks of the right-wing." At this murderous meeting, Wu Jingchao expressed his views on the situation, introduced Li Jinghan's reactionary fallacies of cursing the Party as Qin Shi Huang, ideological remolding as a violation of human rights, and new intellectuals as new bears, and attacked "Renda" as a "neither fish nor fowl," a dogmatic "fortress" that must be "destroyed." Finally, he also begged his master Zhang Bojun to instruct specific tasks based on the current situation.
      For Wu Jingchao, the first ten days of June was indeed an "extraordinary" ten days! Please see this activity schedule: On the 2nd, he participated in the report meeting of the five universities in Beijing convened by Zhang Bojun. On the 4th, he participated in and presided over the conspiracy meeting of the Central Committee of the CDL to abolish the Party committee system. On the 5th, he had a secret conversation with Fei Xiaotong, who had just met with Zhang Bojun. On the 6th, he attended the "June 6th" conspiracy meeting. On the 7th, he and Fei Xiaotong, who had just come from Zhang Bojun, made a pact of mutual defense, and lit a fire at the symposium of non-Party figures at the Renmin University of China. On the 8th, taking the opportunity to talk with Comrade Yu Yifu, he praised Chen Da and Li Jinghan, and defended Chu Anping's fallacy of "Party World." On the 9th, he participated in a meeting to conspire to restore bourgeois sociology, and on the same evening, he attempted to "convey" the so-called "Chairman Mao's instructions on abolishing the Party committee system" fabricated by Zhang Bojun at the enlarged meeting of the CDL "Renda" branch committee. During this period, he also engaged in some private collusion activities.

The process of participating in planning and implementing the anti-socialist strategic plan of the Zhang-Luo Alliance can clearly show several characteristics of Wu Jingchao's sinful activities: First, proactive and active. As long as Zhang and Luo come up with a bad idea, Wu is good at immediately turning it into a concrete plan and implementing it; second, planning and offering suggestions. On key issues, he is always skilled in proposing battle plans based on "leadership intentions"; third, far-sightedness. All the reactionary plans he designed always have a lot of pretexts, are deceptive, and have relatively thorough considerations for the steps of attack or retreat. These characteristics show that Wu Jingchao truly deserves to be a strategist and capable general of the Zhang-Luo Alliance.

    揭露章罗联盟的谋士——吴景超
　　许征帆
    右派大将吴景超，是章罗联盟智囊团里的头号人物。他参与这个联盟的反社会主义战略计划的制定，并力图实现它。
    我们知道，章罗联盟反社会主义的战略是：首先，趁党整风的时机，借“批评”、“监督”、“争鸣”之名，在科学文教界到处放火，煽动教师带领学生上街；其次，再把火放到小商小贩中去，使上了街的学生与市民结合起来，造成混乱的局面；最后，打着“收拾残局”的幌子，粉墨登场，妄想取共产党而代之，复辟资本主义。
    这个狠毒的战略计划，虽是最近才全盘暴露出来，但早在大“放”、大“鸣”之前，章罗联盟的成员已千方百计在为实现它创造条件。在这方面吴景超当然不会落后于自己的“盟兄”、“盟弟”。下面举出几件大事，作为证明。
      首立“汗马功劳”
    第一，要实现反党、反社会主义的阴谋，资产阶级右派分子，必须控制自己所在的组织，使它变质，成为作战的基地。吴景超已认识到把民盟抓到章罗联盟手中的意义。要掌握民盟，关键在于盟内的右派能否团结起来，争取中派，排挤左派。为此，吴氏夫妇亲自出马，以三十多年老朋友的身分“苦谏”罗隆基应与章伯钧搞好关系，罗用实际行动证明了他接受这种建议。在建立这个反动联盟过程中，吴景超首立“汗马功劳”。
    章罗联盟建立后，右派分子就开始了排斥左派的行动，在执行这一阴谋的过程中，吴景超的
  “功绩”同样是不可埋没的，他参与了攻击邓初民的大合唱，咒骂他是“教条主义者”；参加了进攻民盟北京市委会的活动，企图把吴晗撵走，让曾昭抡上台；进行了改组民盟中央文教委员会为文教部的工作，把楚图南搞下来，将费孝通捧上去，而吴景超也被内定为第一副部长。
    总之，一连串的“贡献”，使得仅仅有五年盟龄的吴景超，由一般的盟员，而民盟中央文教委员会委员，而中央委员兼学习委员会副主任委员，而内定为文教部首席副部长，并代表民盟出席全国政协。真是官运亨通，青云直上，这就是章罗联盟给自己的忠实的谋士的“报酬”。
      为右派筹建政治大军
    第二，为了建立一支反社会主义的政治大军，吴景超和他的同道们从两方面着手。一方面，准备高速度地发展民主同盟的组织。章罗叫嚣要吸收一两百万新盟员，要取消“防区制”，好把各阶级、各阶层中那些对新中国心怀不满的落后分子，都搜罗进去。吴景超利用了他的民盟中国人民大学支部主委的职权，力图贯彻章罗联盟的组织路线。他主张突破民盟只发展知识分子“中上层”（教授、讲师）的界限，要在助教以及超龄团员中找发展对象，以便有传种接代人，与共产党“长期共存”。于是他在最近竟发展了右派分子许孟雄、王衍臻等，并把葛佩琦、贺安等这些牛鬼蛇神作为联系与培养的对象。
    另一方面讨好旧知识界中的落后分子，打击工农知识分子。在罗隆基“我对高级知识分子问题的了解和意见”、“加强党与非党知识分子的团结”的两次发言里，在费孝通的“知识分子的早春天气”、“‘早春’前后”两篇文章里，充分暴露了章罗联盟在这个方面的鬼计。吴景超是这四篇臭气冲天的文章起草人之一。可见他在这条战线上是扮演着何等重要的角色。
    还应该指出，为了笼络旧知识界中的落后者，吴景超恬不知耻地给这部分人搽粉抹胭脂。把他们形容得完美无缺，认为强调思想改造对这伙人来说，完全是多余的。比如，他就把右派分子李景汉等捧上天。而在民盟中国人民大学支部工作中，他又一贯漠视盟员的思想改造工作，对盟员说：一年至少必须拿出两篇科学论文来，其他（指政治学习、思想改造）都是废话。他所以敌视思想改造工作，无非是害怕广大的旧知识分子在思想改造过程中社会主义觉悟提高，因而挖掉章罗联盟的墙脚，妨碍他们的政治大军的建立。
    为要逐步实现章罗联盟反社会主义的战略计划，他还当面向章罗建议，应该在全国人民代表大会、全国人民政治协商会议之外，再建立一个由各种专家（即旧知识分子）组成的政策委员会，以取消党的决策权。这个建议，得到章罗采纳，而发展成为臭名远扬的“政治设计院”和“平反委员会”。
    更恶毒的是吴景超到处嚷嚷，说什么要实现“互相监督”、“百家争鸣”有两大困难：头一个是没自己的通讯社，第二个是缺乏资料，因此，他主张民主党派必须有一个足以与新华社竞争的通讯机关，并痛骂我国的保密制度为封建愚民政策，要求一切保密资料公开，以方便他们对社会主义的进攻。
    企图复辟资产阶级社会学
    第三，在今年3月间“争鸣”杂志召开的座谈会上，吴景超提出“百家争鸣最好能与互相监督的任务联系起来。”这里透露了他企图将学术上的争鸣赋予政治斗争的内容，便于资产阶级右派偷运各种私货，以占领政治地盘与思想阵地。这里举出他反对马克思列宁主义，复辟资产阶级社会学的阴谋，作为证据。
    今年1月间，吴景超发表了“社会学在新中国还有地位吗？”的短文，对马克思列宁主义作了一次试探性的进攻。6月9日在所谓“社会学工作筹备委员会第一次会议”上，吴竟首先创议开设社会学学系，并提出首先在北京、上海、广州、成都这四大城市的大学建系的具体方案，规定在北京须以中国人民大学的社会调查研究室、中央民族学院、北京大学为复辟社会学的据点。
    要复辟资产阶级社会学，必然要反对我国的指导思想马克思列宁主义。吴景超诬蔑马克思列宁主义为“教条主义”，咒骂“它已经影响到许多人的世界观”，责备马克思列宁主义者“迷信”马恩列斯不敢“批判”他们的著作，不敢打倒这几个“偶像”，因而成为“教条主义”者。
    谁都知道，马克思列宁主义与教条主义的根本区别，在于它们对实践采取不同的态度。而吴景超竟提出以是否敢于反对马克思列宁主义经典著作家，作为马克思列宁主义或教条主义的分界线。这种问题的提法，正好暴露了吴景超原来是在反对所谓“教条主义”的幌子下干着谋杀马克思列宁主义的暴行。
    吴景超反对马克思列宁主义，复辟资产阶级社会学的言行，并不是什么单纯的学术主张与活动，而是在为实现章罗联盟反对社会主义战略计划作思想准备与干部准备。
  一马当先向学校党委制开火
    第四，篡夺党在科学与文教界的领导权，是章罗联盟反对社会主义战略计划的头一个组成部分，而控制各大学又是这一部分的第一个环节。因此他们觉得非扫除党委制这个碉堡不可。于是吴景超一马当先，向党委制开火。
    早在去年党提出“长期共存，互相监督”之后，吴景超就到处卖弄他那套从旧清华大学搬来的形形色色的委员会。他一方面吹嘘他那些校务会议、财务委员会，人事委员会等等的优越性，一方面咒骂高等学校中的党委制有“内幕”，有“见不得人的事”，“独断独行”，与我国宪法第十七条的精神相违背。他想让别人“逻辑”地得出必须以他那套委员会来代替党委制的结论。
    吴景超方案企图搞垮党委制的毒计主要有三条。其一，大学中党的任何建议，必须根据“吴记”的各种委员会“调查研究”所得的材料。其二，党委会提出的建议，只有在提交校务会议通过之后，才发生法律效力，命令学校行政当局付诸实施。其三，各大学中的民盟支委会（其实是指章罗联盟分店），通过分布在各种委员会中的“盟员”的汇报，了解并掌握全校情况，好取党委会而代之。这样，在各种各样、大大小小的委员会的上下夹攻、包抄侧击下，中国共产党在高等学校的领导权，就“化整为零”被消灭得一干二净。如果吴景超的“如意算盘”实现了，那自然要出现封建式的“把头治校”，一小撮右派教授垄断学校的一切，横行霸道，把各大学校作为哺育资本主义的温床和章罗联盟的干部制造所。
    由于向高等学校的党委制放出了第一枪的战功，吴景超被章罗联盟委派为消灭“党委负责制”小组的负责人之一，就在这个小组里，诞生了“我们对于高等学校领导制度的建议（草案草稿）”这个反动纲领。在这个纲领中，他诬蔑党委制的无耻谰言，得到了进一步的具体化；他的建立各种委员会的思想，有了进一步的发挥。无怪乎这个纲领的起草人黄药眠要声明，他的“杰作”主要是综合吴景超与陶大镛的主张而产生的。
    “六·六”阴谋会议前后
    第五，以章罗联盟谋士的身份，出席“六·六”阴谋会议，是吴景超反党、反社会主义活动的高峰。这个会是资产阶级政治野心家研究“目前的形势与右派的任务”的会议。在这个杀气腾腾的会上，吴景超发表对形势的看法，介绍了李景汉的咒骂党为秦始皇、思想改造为侵犯人权、新知识分子为新狗熊的反动谬论，并攻击“人大”为“四不像”，必须“摧毁”的教条主义“堡垒”，最后，他还恳求主子章伯钧根据当时的局势，指示具体的任务。
      6月上旬，对吴景超说来那的确是“不平凡”的一旬啊！请看这个活动日程表：二日，参加了章伯钧召开的北京五大学的汇报会。四日，参与主持民盟中央的取消党委制的阴谋会。五日，与刚刚见过章伯钧的费孝通密谈。六日，出席“六·六”阴谋会议。七日，和刚刚从章伯钧那儿来的费孝通订立攻守同盟，并在中国人民大学党外人士座谈会上点火。八日，借与于毅夫同志谈话的机会，替陈达、李景汉吹嘘，为储安平的“党天下”的谬论辩护。九日，参加阴谋复辟资产阶级社会学的会议，并在当天晚上企图在民盟“人大”支委扩大会议上，“传达”章伯钧?造的所谓“毛主席关于取消党委制的指示”。在这段时间里，还干了些私下串连的活动。
    参与策划与执行章罗联盟的反社会主义战略计划的过程，可以鲜明地看出吴景超的罪恶活动的几个特点：第一，主动积极。只要章罗一出个什么坏主意，吴善于立刻把它化为具体的方案、计划，付之执行；第二，设谋献策。在关键性的问题上，他总是精于根据“领导意图”提出作战计划；第三，深谋远虑。凡是他设计出来的各反动方案，幌子总是特别多，欺骗性大，而且进攻或退却的步骤，都有比较周密的考虑。这些特点说明吴景超真不愧为章罗联盟的谋士与干将。
