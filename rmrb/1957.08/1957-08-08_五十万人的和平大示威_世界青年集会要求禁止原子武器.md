　　Half a Million People in Peaceful Demonstration
　　——World Youth Assembly Demands Ban on Atomic Weapons
　　By our reporters Cheng Guangrui and Dai Feng

　　Kosmodemyanskaya, the mother of Soviet hero Zoya, and Nagata Hisako, a Japanese girl who was a victim of the atomic bomb, embraced warmly as soon as they met. Kosmodemyanskaya took off her white scarf and put it around Hisako's neck, then gently stroked Hisako's hair, holding her close. Hisako, deeply moved by this great maternal love, snuggled close to Kosmodemyanskaya, smiling with tears in her eyes...

　　This happened on August 6th at the rally for peace and friendship among youth of all countries held at Manege Square in Moscow. The 500,000 participants in the rally—youth from various countries participating in the festival and citizens of Moscow—could not help but be moved by this touching scene. They came here to rally on the twelfth anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima to express their common will: to strive for peace and friendship, to never allow war and atomic bombs to take away their loved ones again, and to never allow the people of any country to suffer the fate of Nagata Hisako!

　　It was an unforgettable night. Representatives of youth from various countries, holding flags and torches, and peace-loving Muscovites crowded Manege Square next to Red Square and all the surrounding streets. Some even stood on the rooftops of buildings next to the square. As night fell, the rally began. Two teams of young people walked onto the stage holding torches, handing one torch to a girl, who then lit a huge "peace torch" on the stage. The raging flames symbolized the endless struggle of youth from all countries for peace.

　　The first speaker was Nagata Hisako, a Japanese girl from Nagasaki, a historical witness to the atomic bomb disaster. She spoke of how the American atomic bomb took away her relatives and her happy life twelve years ago.

　　...That was August 9th, twelve years ago. The weather was so beautiful. The war had forced the school to close, so Hisako had to study at home. In the early morning, her mother went to work, stroking Hisako's shoulder as usual before leaving, and told her: "Study hard and don't run around." Ten-year-old Hisako watched her mother leave with round eyes, never knowing it would be their last goodbye! Not long after, there was a flash of blue light, the house collapsed, and Hisako immediately lost consciousness... When she was rescued, she felt dizzy and her nose was bleeding. She could no longer find her mother. Hisako has lived such a painful life in the twelve years since. Atomic disease has robbed her of her health. She is twenty-two years old this year, but she is still thin and small, and because her trachea is suffocated, she has to have a hole in her neck to breathe...

　　Nagata Hisako said that she was still lucky. Currently, there are more than 800,000 men and women in Japan suffering from more severe atomic diseases than her, and some of them die every day. Therefore, she firmly advocates banning atomic weapons. She said excitedly at the meeting: "Let us unite, let the people of the world unite to ban atomic weapons, so that there can be lasting peace."

　　Who can fail to pay tribute to this warrior who fights to ban atomic weapons? Who can fail to sympathize with this atomic disease patient? Kosmodemyanskaya and girls from the Soviet Union, China, and Africa walked onto the stage and warmly embraced Hisako. The applause of millions of people in the square thundered.

　　Also attending the meeting today were atomic bomb victims Hiroshi Tsunooka and Tetsuaki Kiyotsuka. On the morning of August 6th, twelve years ago, sixteen-year-old Tetsuaki Kiyotsuka and more than fifty other children were running and exercising in the street when American planes flew by. Soon, the atomic bomb fell, and Tetsuaki Kiyotsuka was thrown more than ten feet away by a black wind, his whole body on fire and unconscious. When he was rescued, only seven of the fifty-odd children were still breathing. He was one of the survivors. But the atomic bomb explosion affected his health, and the muscles on his chest were burned with layers of wrinkles. Later, he became a monk. He told us: "I came here so that my tragic experience will not be repeated on others."

　　Banning atomic weapons is the common will of the people and youth of all countries. Soviet hero, "footless flying general" Maresiev, and representatives from Britain, India, Canada, Japan, and other countries all expressed this will at the meeting. Listen to Maresiev's loud voice: "For a happy future, let us actively fight against atomic weapons and against instigating new wars." Listen to the call of Japanese representative Sano: "If you want to live a peaceful life, then join our struggle to stop atomic weapons!" How meaningful are the words of Canadian peace activist James Endicott: "A few hours ago, my eighth granddaughter was born at home. I think that in order to prevent radiation from entering her body, and to prevent radiation from entering the bodies of men and women in every corner of the world, the only way is to mobilize the masses to demand that their governments stop testing atomic and hydrogen bombs."

　　War, no! People need peace! When the screen on the stage showed the thick smoke of war and broken walls, it also showed eye-catching words in various languages: "No!" When the screen showed people boating, swimming, children dancing, workers studying—everywhere flowers blooming—it also showed "Peace" in various languages.

　　Songs, songs, everywhere are songs of peace! Listen to the Japanese youth singing "We will never allow the use of atomic bombs." This song is an indictment of the United States' use and testing of atomic weapons to kill the Japanese people:

　　"The fishing boats are all idle, the eyes of the boat owners are blind,
　　This is the tragedy caused by two atomic bombs,
　　People on land, people on the sea,
　　Beware! Don't let the third atomic bomb fall..."

　　Today this song resounds throughout Moscow, and also resounds throughout Hiroshima, and resounds throughout many cities in the world. Today many cities in the world are commemorating this painful day of "August 6th," protesting against the unwillingness of American imperialism to stop testing atomic weapons. While the meeting was being held in Moscow, the Japanese representatives suddenly received a telegram from their homeland. The telegram said: As long as atomic weapons are not banned, the song "We will never allow the use of atomic bombs" will never stop.

　　This song has not stopped, it echoes in the hearts of the 500,000 people who attended the meeting today! It flies with the white doves released by that lovely little girl in the Moscow night sky...

### 五十万人的和平大示威——世界青年集会要求禁止原子武器

    五十万人的和平大示威
    ——世界青年集会要求禁止原子武器
    本报记者　程光锐　戴枫
    苏联英雄卓娅的母亲科斯莫杰米扬斯卡娅和原子弹受害者、日本姑娘永田尚子，一个是失去女儿的母亲，一个是失去母亲的女儿，她们一见面就热烈地拥抱起来。科斯莫杰米扬斯卡娅取下自己的白围巾给尚子围上，然后用手轻轻地抚摸尚子的头发，把尚子搂在身边，对这种伟大的母爱无限激动的尚子紧紧地偎依在科斯莫杰米扬斯卡娅的身边，微笑着，两眼闪着泪花……。
    这件事发生在8月6日莫斯科练马广场举行的各国青年争取和平友谊大会上。大会五十万参加者——参加联欢节的各国青年和莫斯科的市民都不能不为这动人的情景所激动。他们在广岛原子弹爆炸十二周年这一天来到这里集会，就是为了表达他们共同的意志：争取和平与友谊，决不允许战争和原子弹再夺去他们的亲人，决不能再让各国人民遭受永田尚子的命运！
    这是一个令人难忘的夜晚，高举着旗帜和火把的各国青年代表们和爱好和平的莫斯科人把红场旁边的马乃热广场和广场附近的所有街道都挤得水泄不通，甚至有人站在广场旁边大楼的屋顶上。夜幕降临的时候大会开始了，两队青年手执火把走上讲台，把一支火把交给一个女孩，再由这个女孩把讲台上的一个巨大“和平火炬”点燃，熊熊的火焰燃烧着，这是各国青年争取和平、斗争不息的象征。
    第一个讲话的就是原子弹惨祸的历史见证人、来自长崎的日本姑娘永田尚子，她在讲出十二年前美国的原子弹如何夺去她的亲人和她的幸福生活。
    ……那是十二年前的8月9日，天气是那样的美好，战争迫使学校停了课，尚子只好在家温课，清早妈妈上班去，临走前照例抚摸着尚子的肩头，叮咛她：“好好念书，不要乱跑。”十岁的尚子睁着一双圆眼睛目送着自己的妈妈出门，谁知道这就是永别！不多一会，只见青光一闪，房屋倒塌，尚子立刻失去了知觉……。当她被人救醒过来的时候，只感到头昏，鼻子出血，她再也找不到妈妈了。以后的十二年尚子过着多么痛苦的日子，原子病使她失去了健康，她今年已经二十二岁了，可是长得又瘦又小，因为气管窒息了，不得不在脖子上开个洞来呼吸……。
    永田尚子说，她还算是侥幸的，目前日本还有八十多万男女害着比她更严重的原子病，而且每天都有一些人死亡。因此，她坚决主张禁止原子武器。她在这个大会上激动地说：“让我们团结起来吧，全世界的人民都为禁止原子武器团结起来，才能有永久的和平。”
    谁能不向这位为禁止原子武器而斗争的战士致敬？谁能不对这位原子病患者寄与同情？科斯莫杰米扬斯卡娅和苏联、中国、非洲的姑娘走到讲台上和尚子热烈拥抱，广场上千万人的掌声雷鸣。
    今天来参加大会的还有原子弹受害者纲冈弘、清胤彻昭。十二年前的8月6日清晨，十六岁的清胤彻昭和别的五十多个孩子在街上跑步、做操，这时飞来了美国的飞机，不久原子弹落下来，清胤彻昭被一阵黑风抛了一丈多远，混身着火，人事不省。等他被救醒过来的时候，五十多个孩子只有七个孩子还有点呼吸，他就是救活了的一个。但是原子弹的爆炸影响了他的健康，他胸前的肌肉被烧出了层层的折皱。后来他出家当了和尚，他对我们说：“我来到这里就是不让我的惨痛的遭遇再在别人身上重演。”
    禁止原子武器是各国人民和各国青年的共同意志。苏联英雄、“无脚飞将军”密烈西叶夫和英国、印度、加拿大、日本等国的代表都在大会上表达了这个意志，请听密烈西叶夫的洪亮的声音：“为了幸福的将来，我们积极起来为反对原子武器，为反对策动新战争而斗争。”请听日本代表左野的呼声：“如果想过和平的生活，那么就加入我们制止原子武器的斗争行列吧！”加拿大和平人士文幼章的话多么意味深长，他说：“几个钟头以前，我的家里诞生了第八个孙女儿，我想为了不让放射线侵入她的身体，也不让放射线侵入世界各个角落的男女们的身体，只有发动群众要求自己的政府停止原子弹和氢弹的试验。”
    战争，不行！人民需要和平！讲台的银幕上在映出战火的浓烟和断壁残垣的时候，同时用各国文字映出引人注目的字：“不行！”银幕上再映出人们划船、游泳，孩子们在跳舞，工人们在念书——到处是鲜花开放的时候，同时映出各种文字的“和平”。
    歌声，歌声，到处是和平的歌声！请听日本青年们合唱的“决不允许使用原子弹”的歌声。这首歌曲是控诉美国使用和试验原子武器杀害日本人民的：
      “渔船都闲着，船主人的眼睛都瞎了，
    这是两颗原子弹造成的惨祸，
    陆地上的人，海洋上的人，
    注意啊！不要让第三颗原子弹降落……”
    今天这歌声响彻了莫斯科，也响彻了广岛，响彻了世界上许多城市。今天世界上许多城市都在纪念“8月6日”这个沉痛的日子，抗议美帝国主义不愿停止试验原子武器。当莫斯科正在举行大会的时候，日本的代表们忽然接到了来自他们祖国的电报。电报上相约：原子武器一天不禁止，“决不允许使用原子弹”的歌声就一天不停。
    这歌声没有停止，它回响在今天参加大会的五十万人的心头！它随着那个可爱的小女孩放出的白鸽飞翔在莫斯科的夜空。……
