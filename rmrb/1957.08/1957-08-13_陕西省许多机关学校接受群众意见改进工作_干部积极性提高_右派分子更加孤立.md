Shaanxi Province's Many Organizations and Schools Accept Mass Opinions to Improve Work
Cadre Enthusiasm Increases; Rightists Become More Isolated

Xi'an, August 12th (Our Reporter Li Qian) -- Various organizations, enterprises, and schools in the Shaanxi area are beginning to address the major issues raised by the masses during the rectification movement.

The Civil Affairs Department previously had no one specifically responsible for handling letters and visits from the people, and the department leaders did not pay attention to it. This resulted in some problems reflected in the letters and visits from the people not being resolved for a long time. It has now been decided to assign five cadres to be responsible for handling letters and visits from the people, under the personal leadership of a department head.

Students at the Northwest Russian College, based on the current situation of an oversupply of Russian language cadres in the country, raised opinions about transferring to other majors, changing jobs, or transferring to other schools. After research and approval by the Higher Education Department, the school leaders decided that first- and second-year students, on a voluntary basis, could have half of them transfer to other majors or jobs. The school has now specially hired tutoring teachers to help students transferring to science and engineering majors to catch up.

The Northwest Industrial Construction Design Institute accepted mass opinions and improved its work system and procedures, thereby reducing the burden on the chief engineer and shortening the design time.

The Shaanxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative Council, based on the opinions raised by the masses, decided to abolish the section-level leadership set up in some departments, with the department heads directly responsible for leading various tasks. Many universities and colleges have also studied issues such as improving the academic system, teaching work, and graduate distribution.

Because various units have attached importance to improving their work during the anti-rightist struggle, it has encouraged the cadres' will to fight against rightists, increased everyone's work enthusiasm, and made the rightists even more isolated.

    陕西省许多机关学校接受群众意见改进工作
    干部积极性提高　右派分子更加孤立
    本报西安12日电　记者李茜报道：陕西地区各机关、企业、学校正着手解决群众在整风运动中提出来的重大问题。
    民政厅过去对人民来信来访工作无专人负责处理，厅的领导人也不过问，致使人民来信来访中反映的一些问题，很长时间得不到解决。现在决定抽出五个干部负责处理人民来信来访，由一个厅长亲自领导。
    西北俄专学生根据目前国家俄文干部供过于求的情况，提出转学、转业、转校的意见。该校领导经过研究并请高等教育部批准，决定一、二年级学生在自愿的原则下，可以有一半人转学转业。现在该校已专门聘请了辅导教师，帮助转理、工科的学生补课。
    西北工业建筑设计院接受群众意见，改进了工作制度和手续，因而既减少了总工程师的负担，也缩短了设计时间。
    陕西省供销社理事会根据群众提出的意见，决定取消了有些处内所设的科一级的领导，由处长直接负责领导各项工作。很多高等学校也研究了改进学制、教学工作和毕业生分配等问题。
    由于各单位在反右派斗争中重视改进工作，从而鼓舞了干部反右派斗争的意志，提高了大家的工作积极性，使右派分子更加孤立。
