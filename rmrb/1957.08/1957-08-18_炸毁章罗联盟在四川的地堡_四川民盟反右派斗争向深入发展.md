Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, August 17th: The anti-Rightist struggle within the China Democratic League (CDL) organizations at all levels in Sichuan Province has achieved preliminary victories. Many Rightist elements have bowed their heads in confession, and organizations at all levels are pursuing the victory.

Sichuan was one of the main "strongholds" of the Zhang-Luo clique. The Rightist clique headed by Pan Dakui, member of the CDL Central Committee and Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Committee, including his two right-hand men - Zhao Yiming, Deputy Secretary-General of the CDL Sichuan Provincial Committee, and Zhang Songtao, Secretary-General of the CDL Sichuan Provincial Committee and Chengdu Municipal Committee, seized control of the Sichuan CDL organization and launched a frenzied attack on the Communist Party. They contacted a group of followers, promoted and resolutely implemented the reactionary political program of the Zhang-Luo Alliance, and proposed a local political design institute scheme. They also sent people to the grassroots level to instigate trouble, actively implemented Zhang-Luo's "great development" policy, and advocated recruiting members regardless of political conditions. Under their influence, Chongqing and some counties and cities successively developed a batch of CDL members with historical political problems or those who had consistently been dissatisfied with the Communist Party.

As the struggle gradually deepened, from July onwards, many new Rightist elements were successively exposed in various government agencies, universities, and small and medium-sized cities. For example, Luo Zhongxin, member of the CDL Central Committee and Deputy Governor of Sichuan Province, Zhang Xueyan, member of the CDL Provincial Committee and Deputy Director of the Department of Justice, and Mu Jibo, the newly joined Deputy Director of the Sichuan Provincial Library, etc. They were consistently dissatisfied with the Communist Party, used various occasions to attack the Communist Party, and frequently engaged in small-group activities within the CDL, luring the backward and attacking leftist elements. From many revealed facts, they were all members of the intangible organization of the Pan Dakui clique.

In universities and colleges where the struggle was launched earlier, the ugly faces of the Rightist elements were exposed more thoroughly. For example, Zeng Shufan, Vice President of Sichuan University of Finance and Economics, Zhang Mosheng, Director of the Chinese Department of Sichuan University, Zhang Zehou, Director of the Chinese Department of Sichuan Normal College, and Yang Zhinong, Professor of Sichuan Agricultural College, etc. During the rectification campaign, these Rightist elements viciously attacked the committee system, saying that the Party Committee could not lead the school. Some even incited students to make trouble, attempting to create great democracy. For example, the student strike and petition that occurred at Sichuan Agricultural College due to the school relocation issue was instigated single-handedly by Rightist elements such as Yang Zhinong.

After mid-July, the faces of the Rightist elements in the CDL organizations of various small and medium-sized cities were also revealed one by one. Among them were Liu Shiyi in Neijiang, Zhang Jianbo in Xichang, Sheng Zerong in Leshan, and Zhang Mosheng in Nanchong. They were all responsible persons of the local CDL organizations. Many of them had been trained in the "CDL In-service Cadre Training Class" organized by Pan Dakui to cultivate arsonist backbones and resolutely implemented Pan Dakui's sinister instructions in small and medium-sized cities. During the "Great Blooming and Contending," Sheng Zerong convened twenty-two discussion meetings in middle schools and cultural and educational circles in Leshan County, launching a frenzied attack on the Communist Party.

After the ugly faces of these Rightist elements were exposed, the masses' understanding was improved. Leftist and middle-of-the-road elements among the CDL members actively participated in the struggle. Some wrote written materials overnight to expose the words and deeds of the Rightist elements, and some traveled from afar to the city to participate in meetings to expose the Rightist elements. When fighting against the Rightist element Han Wenwei, cadres from Mianyang, hundreds of miles away from Chengdu, also came to participate, making it impossible for Han Wenwei to quibble. After the struggle, the righteousness of the CDL organizations in various places has risen, and the Rightist elements have become isolated. The relationship between the CDL organizations in many schools and government agencies and the Communist Party organizations has become closer. Many people said that they received a profound education in this movement.

At present, the Sichuan branch of the Zhang-Luo clique has initially collapsed, and the movement is turning to greater depth. The Rightist elements have also begun to differentiate, confessing some activities of intangible organizations. However, some people are still watching and unwilling to confess thoroughly. The rectification leadership group of the CDL Provincial Committee is formulating steps to further develop the struggle.

    炸毁章罗联盟在四川的地堡
    四川民盟反右派斗争向深入发展
    新华社成都17日电  民盟四川省各级组织反右派斗争已经获得初步胜利。许多右派分子已低头认罪，各级组织正在乘胜追击。
    四川是章罗集团的主要“据点”之一。以民盟中央委员、四川省主任委员潘大逵为首的右派小集团，包括他的左右二膀——民盟四川省委副秘书长赵一明、民盟四川省委兼成都市委秘书主任张松涛，掌握四川盟组织向共产党展开了猖狂进攻。他们联系一批喽啰，宣传并坚决执行章罗联盟的反动政治纲领，提出了地方政治设计院方案。他们还派人到各基层去点火，积极执行章罗的“大发展”方针，主张不问政治条件，拉人入盟。在他们的影响下，重庆及一些县市都陆续发展了一批有历史政治问题或对共产党一贯不满的盟员。
    随着斗争的逐步深入，从7月份起，在各级机关、大专学校和中小城市陆续揭露出许多新的右派分子。例如，民盟中央委员、四川省副省长罗忠信，民盟省委委员、司法厅副厅长张雪岩以及新入盟的四川省图书馆副馆长穆济波等。他们一贯对共产党不满，利用各种场合向共产党进攻，还经常在盟内进行小集团活动，拉拢落后，打击左派分子。从许多揭发的事实看来，他们都是潘大逵集团无形组织的成员。
    在斗争开展较早的大专学校中，右派分子的丑恶面目暴露较为彻底。例如，四川财经学院副院长曾庶凡、四川大学中文系主任张默生、四川师范学院中文系主任张泽厚、四川农学院教授杨志农等。这些右派分子在整风期间恶毒地攻击党委制，说党委不能领导学校，有的甚至煽动学生闹事，企图制造大民主。例如，四川农学院因迁校问题而发生学生罢课请愿的事件，就是右派分子杨志农等一手煽动起来的。
    7月中旬以后，各个中、小城市民盟组织的右派分子的面貌也一一揭露出来。其中如内江的刘石夷、西昌的张剑波、乐山的盛泽荣、南充的张默生等。他们都是民盟地方组织的负责人，许多人都在潘大逵为培养放火骨干分子而主办的“民盟在职干部训练班”中受过训练，在中、小城市坚决执行潘大逵的阴谋指示。盛泽荣在“大鸣大放”中就在乐山县的中学及文教界召集了二十二个座谈会，向共产党进行了猖狂的进攻。
    这些右派分子的丑恶面目被揭露后，群众的认识都有了提高。盟员中的左派和中间分子都积极参加了斗争。有的人连夜写出书面材料揭露右派分子的言行，有的从远道赶赴城市参加会议揭发右派分子。当斗争右派分子韩文畦时，远离成都数百里的绵阳机关干部也赶来参加，使韩文畦无法狡辩。经过斗争后，各地盟组织的正气都上升了，右派分子都已经孤立起来。许多学校、机关中的民盟组织与共产党组织的关系密切了。许多人说，他们在这次运动中受到了一次深刻教育。
    目前，章罗集团四川分店已初步崩溃，运动正在转向深入。右派分子也开始分化，交代了一些无形组织的活动。但有些人尚在观望，不愿彻底交代。民盟省组织的整风领导小组正在拟定步骤，准备进一步展开斗争。
