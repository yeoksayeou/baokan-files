Wang Ruowang: Whose Fragrant Flower?
    Xuhui

    The facts are just as Chairman Mao said: "The two slogans, 'Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend,' are, in terms of their literal meaning, without class character. The proletariat can utilize them, the bourgeoisie can utilize them, and other people can utilize them. As for what constitutes a fragrant flower and what constitutes poisonous weeds, each class, stratum, and social group has its own view."

    Among the writers in Shanghai, Wang Ruowang has fully utilized these two slogans. During this rectification movement, he attended every meeting, spoke at every meeting, and always talked about "letting go" and "contending." He also made many reports and wrote a large number of articles. He was truly very active. Wang Ruowang is a Communist Party member who joined the Party in 1937 and has received more than 20 years of Party education. People have the right to expect him to release the fragrant flowers of the proletariat to fight against the poisonous weeds of the bourgeoisie.

    However, what exactly did Wang Ruowang release? Wang Ruowang and his supporters say they are fragrant flowers. Whose fragrant flowers are they, after all? Are they proletarian or bourgeois? This is a question that needs to be clarified.

    Let's take a look at his five essays: "Step-by-Step Defenses" (Wenhui Daily, April 26), "Separated by a Board" (Xinmin Evening News, May 7), "Explanation of 'Backward Elements'" (Wenhui Daily, May 20), "Not Right," "Raising Cattle, Taking Apprentices, and Others" (the former was submitted to Jiefang Daily on May 24, the latter on June 5, but neither was published).

    "Step-by-Step Defenses" was published when the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China was holding a series of forums for intellectuals. As everyone knows, the great blooming and contending in Shanghai began on April 13 with the publication of the Jiefang Daily editorial "We Approve of Letting Go." Wang Ruowang could not have been unaware that even those who were dissatisfied with socialism were cheering for "thawing" at this time. However, Wang Ruowang was not satisfied. He believed that there were still many people who opposed blooming and contending at this time. He said: These people "see that the tide of 'contending and letting go' is about to衝擊 [chōngjī] (assail) their jurisdiction, and a great chaos is bound to happen. They lack confidence in their own political and theoretical level and are unable to contend with others. The smartest way is to first build a dam and erect a wooden sign on the dam, writing four large characters: 'Do Not Talk About State Affairs,' so as to maintain the peaceful situation there." It is not difficult for people to see: the "peaceful situation" Wang Ruowang is referring to is the "one flower blooming alone," "one school contending alone," and "do not talk about state affairs" that he mentioned at the beginning of this article. In Wang Ruowang's view, our country is such a dark land enclosed by "dams."

    Wang Ruowang verbally criticized others for "step-by-step defenses." We admit that at that time, some comrades still had some one-sided and erroneous understandings of blooming and contending. The statement that Wang Ruowang criticized about "avoiding poisonous weeds" is indeed an erroneous argument, because poisonous weeds are bound to grow, and this cannot be avoided. However, even when criticizing this argument, Wang Ruowang believed that fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds are fundamentally indistinguishable. He said: "What you consider 'poisonous' often contains fragrance; what you consider 'fragrant' is often only suitable for your personal 'preference,' and may be insignificant." Therefore, he believes that mentioning "standpoint" "often falls into subjectivism and sectarianism."

    Starting from this position of not needing a position, he openly opposed newspapers and periodicals having a position, tone, and mainstream. He believes that whoever advocates that newspapers and periodicals should have a position, tone, and mainstream "does not truly support the 'Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend' policy." People cannot help but ask: What kind of tool is a newspaper after all? Is it not a tool of class struggle? In a class society, which newspaper does not have a position, tone, and mainstream? When the Guangming Daily and Wenhui Daily became tools for the Zhang-Luo alliance to oppose the Communist Party and socialism for a period of time, did they not take anti-communism and anti-socialism as their position, tone, and mainstream? Today, when our people are fighting for socialism, why shouldn't our newspapers and periodicals have a socialist position, tone, and mainstream, and become the standard-bearers of socialist thought? Why is mentioning socialism equated with not supporting the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy? Wang Ruowang believes that all these questions are not worth considering. On the contrary, he believes: "It is certainly not right for those engaged in literary and artistic work not to care about socialist construction, but can it not be allowed by the constitution? Please check which article in the constitution has such a provision?" He further stated: "There is also an argument that 'contending is good, but we must be careful not to violate the constitution.' May I ask: Has anyone violated the constitution in the process of contending? I dare say: No. Since there is none, isn't proposing the clause 'cannot violate the constitution' shooting at a target that isn't there? In my opinion, it is not only shooting at a target that isn't there, but also a means of preemptive defense." He believes that proposing that things that are not allowed by the constitution should not be done is "first using a fabricated hat to block other people's mouths." Wang Ruowang deliberately "forgot" that in Comrade Lu Dingyi's speech on "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," he clearly stated: "Our country already has a constitution, and abiding by the constitution is the duty of the people. This is the consistency within the people. That is to say, loving the motherland and supporting socialism should be consistent for all the people." Was Comrade Lu Dingyi also blocking other people's mouths when he gave this speech? Chairman Mao's six criteria for identifying fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds, "based on the principles of our country's constitution," are even less important in Wang Ruowang's eyes. Wang Ruowang closed his eyes and pretended not to see. Even as he wrote this article, the bourgeois rightists had openly violated the constitution and launched a frenzied attack on the Communist Party, the people, and socialism.

    Wang Ruowang's opposition to "step-by-step defenses" is essentially clearing the way for this attack. The Party teaches us that the struggle between socialism and capitalism in our country in the ideological field has not yet been truly resolved. The policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" is precisely a policy to promote the prosperity of socialist culture. It is by no means to weaken the position of Marxism in the ideological sphere, but to enable Marxists to train themselves, develop themselves, and expand their positions in the struggle against erroneous ideas. Wang Ruowang's demands are exactly the opposite. Even whether to engage in socialism or not, and whether to violate or support the constitution, cannot be interfered with, let alone mobilizing and organizing forces to solve the great task of defeating capitalism on the political and ideological fronts. What Wang Ruowang is asking of the proletariat is: to raise the white flag on its own position and allow capitalism to come and occupy it.

    The matter did not end there. In the essay "Separated by a Board," Wang Ruowang formally launched an attack on this position. He described the "wall" between the Party and the masses as so "mysterious and terrible": "This wall is made of a special material," "the fortifications are strict, and the cold air is pressing," "removing one wall, another wall appears," "like walking in the dark night, encountering a rainy day, some people will encounter a mysterious and terrible 'ghost hitting the wall.'" And this wall, "the materials used are neither bricks nor stones, nor cement, but products belonging to the realm of consciousness." Then, Wang Ruowang described the two sides of "this wall" for us. One side is the private manager, who is "trying his best to contribute a bit of strength to socialist construction, but feels unable to intervene," while the public representative is only "superficially perfunctory" and a two-faced person at heart. Wang Ruowang questioned us: "We hope that bourgeois people can gradually get rid of their 'two-facedness' every day," but our public representatives have "two-facedness," "how can we expect to transform the two-facedness of bourgeois people?" Here, Wang Ruowang and Zhang Naiqi saw the same problem from the same angle and reached the same conclusion. Both the working class and the bourgeoisie have two-facedness. The bourgeoisie is even more enthusiastic about socialism than the working class. The "special material" of the working class, namely Marxism, has created a "ghost hitting the wall." Therefore, the "board separation" should be removed, "first remove this tangible board wall, and then strive to eliminate the wall in the realm of consciousness." It is not difficult to understand that Wang Ruowang is not trying to transform the bourgeoisie according to the image of the proletariat, but to transform the working class in the realm of consciousness to be the same as the bourgeoisie. At that time, they will all become "one-sided," whether they are called "red bourgeoisie" or "red proletariat," it is all the same.

    Not only should there be no distinction between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, but also the original division between advanced elements, intermediate elements, and backward elements was a great crime of "cultivating sectarianism and creating estrangement between the masses and the Party." According to Wang Ruowang's "explanation," what is backward? "When Comrade Zhang has not fully understood a certain problem or a certain work, and has not consciously solved it; and Comrade Wang has understood this problem or this work and can solve it, then on this problem, in this work, Comrade Wang is more advanced than Comrade Zhang, and Comrade Zhang appears backward. But in other problems or work, perhaps Comrade Wang is backward, and Comrade Zhang is advanced. Therefore, one cannot designate that everything else is backward just because someone is backward in this matter. It should be admitted that everyone has times of 'backwardness' and everyone has positive factors." "Including Communist Party members." In the final analysis, "measuring progress and backwardness by political standards" has resulted in "confusion between black and white, ambiguity between right and wrong, the rise of evil, and the decline of righteousness." It's terrible. "Political standards" have made us so "backward." If it weren't for Wang Ruowang's "explanation," we wouldn't know how "backward" we would become. However, after listening to Wang Ruowang's heartfelt persuasion, I still don't understand: In terms of current events, are we wrong to divide rightists and leftists? If we don't divide them in this way, Wang Ruowang, as a Communist Party member, his words and actions are no different from those of rightists. Is this progress or backwardness? Is it saying that Wang Ruowang has "fully understood" and "consciously solved" "this problem, this work" of opposing the Party and socialism, and Wang Ruowang is "advanced" in "this problem, this work" of opposing the Party and socialism, and should not be called a "backward element," but should be called an "advanced element"? And those who support the Party and support socialism should be called "backward elements"? Only then can black and white be clear and right and wrong be clear?

    As the attack of the rightists became increasingly rampant, Wang Ruowang's activities became more "conscious" and "advanced." The forum of veteran workers held by the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions was immediately attacked by Wang Ruowang as soon as the news was published: "Not right." "Going to take it back." Readers will remember that at this forum, the workers realized from their own experience that the bourgeois rightists' remarks published in the newspapers were a challenge to the leadership of the working class and a challenge to the socialist road. The workers justly pointed out that our work achievements are the main aspect; they criticized Li Kangnian's proposal of "fixed interest for twenty years," pointing out that this precisely shows "they still lack the determination to transform themselves into self-reliant laborers"; they criticized the fallacy of "no need for public representatives," solemnly declaring: "If we don't need public representatives and let the private sector lead again, and call us back to the capitalist road, then none of us workers will agree." As soon as this news was published, it was immediately supported by millions of people who supported the leadership of the Communist Party and supported the socialist road. Wang Ruowang said: "This is the veteran workers singing a duet against the Communist Party." He also said: "Even if we sing a duet, we welcome it very much." This sentence is right. The veteran workers' duet is indeed sung with Wang Ruowang's "us."

    Wang Ruowang stood on his stage and lectured the veteran workers, saying: The past newspapers were "reporting good news but not bad news," and became "monotonous and one-sided newspapers." Now "our newspapers are closer to the truth." Only when the newspapers completely become tools of the rightists will they be considered completely "true" and "comprehensive." Therefore, he incited the workers: "You should also point out the shortcomings in our work together," "You can't deny other people's correct opinions with your own little feelings in your own factory"; "You don't have to put a hat on someone that they have no determination to transform themselves"; "Even without public representatives, we may not go back to the capitalist road." May I ask, has anyone ever rebuked veteran workers so rampantly?

    Wang Ruowang, at meetings inside and outside the Party, wantonly attacked "walls within the Party," slandered the suppression of counter-revolutionaries as sectarian struggles, and smeared the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Party as barbarians with no interest in art, who were of course unable to lead cultural and artistic work. On the one hand, he dressed himself up as a hero against sectarianism, and on the other hand, under the pseudonym "Yu Tian," he went to "Literary and Art News" to attack the Party member writer Sun Junqing, saying that Sun's "value has increased tenfold" due to Comrade Zhou Yang's praise and the key cultivation by the leadership. Using fabricated "facts," he basely attacked the Party's leadership.

    Wang Ruowang's duet has not yet finished. But he was cheered by the bourgeois rightists as soon as he appeared. His essays have become weapons for the rightists to attack the Party on many occasions. "Wang Ruowang spoke for us," this is the praise of the bourgeoisie. Wang Ruowang has fallen into the mud pit of the rightists. Isn't it already obvious to which family the "fragrant flowers" grown from this mud pit belong?

    王若望是谁家的香花
    徐汇
    事实正像毛主席所说：“百花齐放、百家争鸣这两个口号，就字面看，是没有阶级性的，无产阶级可以利用它们，资产阶级也可以利用它们，其他的人们也可以利用它们。所谓香花和毒草，各个阶级、阶层和社会集团也有各自的看法。”
    在上海的作家中，王若望是充分地利用了这两个口号的。在这次整风运动中，他是有会必到，到必发言，发言必谈“放”、“鸣”，还作了许多报告，写了大量的文章，真是积极得很。王若望是1937年入党的共产党员，受过党的二十多年的教育，人们有权希望他放出无产阶级的香花，去跟资产阶级的毒草作斗争。
    但是，王若望放出来的究竟是什么东西呢？王若望和他的拥护者说是香花。这香花，又究竟是那一家的，是无产阶级的，还是资产阶级的？这是一个需要弄明白的问题。
    让我们看一看他写的这五篇杂文：“步步设防”（4月26日文汇报）、“一板之隔”（5月7日新闻日报）、“释‘落后分子’”（5月20日文汇报）、“不对头”、“养牛、带徒弟及其他”（前者是5月24日、后者是6月5日给解放日报的，没有发表）。
    “步步设防”发表的时候，正是中共上海市委连续召开知识界座谈会的时候。大家知道，上海的大鸣、大放，是从4月13日解放日报发表“我们赞成放”的社论开始的。王若望不会不知道，就是那些对社会主义心怀不满的人，这时也欢呼“解冻”了。但是，王若望并不满足，他认为这时仍然有许多人反对鸣、放。他说：这些人“看到‘争鸣、争放’的潮流要冲激到他的管辖之下来了，势必要天下大乱，他对自己的政治理论水平又缺乏信心，无力去和别人争鸣，最聪明的办法就是先筑起堤坝来，在堤上树立一块木牌，写上四个大字：‘莫谈国事’，这样来维持他那里的太平局面”。人们不难看出：王若望所指的“太平局面”，就是他在这篇文章的开头所说的“一花独放”、“一家独鸣”、“莫谈国事”。在王若望看来，我们的国家就是这样一个用“堤坝”围起来的黑暗之邦。
    王若望口口声声斥责别人“步步设防”。我们承认，当时确实还有一些同志，对鸣、放还抱有若干片面的错误的了解。王若望所斥责的“避免毒草”的说法，确实是一种错误的论点，因为毒草是要长出来的，这是避免不了的。但是，就是在批判这一论点的时候，王若望却认为香花和毒草是根本无法区别的。他说：“你所认为‘毒’者，往往里面包含着香；你所认为‘香’者，往往仅仅适合你个人‘偏’爱，也许是不足道的货色。”因此，他认为提到“立场”，就“往往会陷入主观主义和宗派主义”。
    从这种不要立场的立场出发，他公开反对报刊要有立场、基调和主流，他认为谁主张报刊要有立场、基调和主流，就是“不真正拥护百花齐放、百家争鸣”。人们不禁要问：报刊到底是一种什么工具？难道它不是一种阶级斗争的工具吗？在阶级社会里，有哪一个报刊是没有立场、基调和主流的？光明日报和文汇报在一个时期成为章罗联盟的反共反社会主义的工具的时候，不是以反共反社会主义为立场、基调和主流的吗？在我们全国人民为社会主义而斗争的今天，我们的报刊为什么不应当有社会主义的立场、基调和主流，成为社会主义思想的旗手？为什么一提到社会主义，就是不拥护百花齐放、百家争鸣？王若望认为这一切问题都是不值得考虑的。相反地，他认为：“搞文艺工作的不管社会主义建设，当然不对，但也不能说宪法不允许吧？请查宪法上那一条有这种规定呢？”他更进一步地提出：“还有一种议论是说：‘争鸣是好的，但要注意决不要违犯宪法’。试问：我们有什么人在争鸣中违犯了宪法呢？我敢说：没有。既然没有，提出‘不得违反宪法’的条例岂不是无的放矢吗？依我看来，不仅是无的放矢，而且是一种预为设防的手段”。他认为提出总不能搞宪法不允许的事，就是“用一顶莫须有的帽子先堵住别人的嘴”。王若望故意地“忘记”了，在陆定一同志所作“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的讲话里，就曾经明确地说过：“我国已经有了宪法，遵守宪法是人民的义务，这就是人民内部的一致性。这就是说，爱祖国，拥护社会主义，是全国人民都应该一致的。”陆定一同志作这个讲话的时候，难道也是先堵住别人的嘴吗？毛主席“根据我国的宪法的原则”，提出了识别香花和毒草的六项标准，更不在王若望的眼里了。王若望竟自闭着眼睛装作看不见，就在他写这篇文章的时候，资产阶级右派已经公然违犯宪法，向共产党、向人民、向社会主义猖狂进攻了。
    王若望反对“步步设防”，实质上正是为这种进攻扫清道路。党教导我们：我国社会主义和资本主义之间，在意识形态方面的谁胜谁负的斗争，还没有真正解决。百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，正是促进社会主义文化繁荣的方针，它绝不是为了削弱马克思主义在思想界的地位，而是为了使马克思主义者在同错误思想的斗争中间，锻炼自己，发展自己，扩大自己的阵地。王若望所要求的却恰好相反，连搞不搞社会主义、违犯还是拥护宪法都不能过问，更不要说动员和组织力量，解决在政治战线和思想战线上战胜资本主义的伟大任务了。王若望要求无产阶级的是：在自己的阵地上升起白旗，听任资本主义前来占领。
    事情并没有结束。在“一板之隔”这篇杂文里，王若望就正式向这个阵地进攻了。他把党和群众之间的“墙”形容得是这样“神秘而又可怕”：“这道墙是用一种特别的材料造的”，“壁垒森严，寒气逼人”，“拆去一道墙，又出现了一道墙”，“如同黑夜里行路，又逢阴雨天，有人会遇到一种神秘的可怕的‘鬼打墙’一般”。而这道墙，“所用材料，既非砖石，又非水泥，而是属于意识方面的产品。”接着，王若望就给我们描写了“这道墙”的两边，一边是私方经理，一边是公方代表，私方经理是“竭力想给社会主义建设贡献出一分力量，但却感到插不上手”，而公方代表却是只在“表面上敷衍”、骨子里却是玩手腕的两面派。王若望责问我们：“我们天天希望资产阶级人士能够逐步改掉‘两面性’”，而我们的公方代表就有“两面性”，“这怎么能指望改造掉资产阶级人士的两面性呢？”在这里，王若望同章乃器从同一个角度、看到了同样的问题、得到了同一的结论。工人阶级同资产阶级都有两面性，资产阶级比工人阶级对社会主义的积极性还高些，工人阶级的“特殊材料”即马克思主义造成了“鬼打墙”。因此，应当去掉“一板之隔”，“先要拆去这道有形的板壁，然后再努力消除意识方面的墙”。不难了解，王若望在这里并不是要按无产阶级的面貌改造资产阶级，而是要工人阶级在意识方面也改造得同资产阶级一样。那时，都变成“一面性”了，叫作“红色资产阶级”、还是“红色无产阶级”，都是一样的。
    不但是资产阶级同无产阶级不应当划分界线，原来我们划分先进分子、中间分子、落后分子，也是犯了“培养宗派主义、造成群众对党隔阂”的大罪。据王若望的“释”，何谓落后？“当张同志对某个问题，某项工作，还没有完全懂得，还没有自觉地去解决它；而另外一位王同志对这个问题，这项工作却懂得了，而且能够解决它，那么在这个问题上，在这项工作中，王同志比张同志先进，张同志就显得落后了。可是在另外的问题或工作中，也许王同志又落后了，而张同志是先进的。所以不能因为某个人在这件事上表现出落后，就派定他其他的一切都落后了。应当承认：每个人都有‘落后’的时候，每个人都有积极的因素。”“包括共产党员在内”。归根到底，“以政治的标准来衡量先进和落后”，造成了“黑白不分，是非不明，邪气上升，正气下降。”真是不得了，“政治标准”竟自把我们弄得这么“落后”了，不经王若望这一“释”，还不知道要“落后”成什么样子。但是，听了王若望苦口婆心的劝说，我却仍然弄不懂：拿眼前的事情来说，我们划分右派、左派是不是又弄错了呢？如果不这样划分，王若望身为共产党员，言论行动却与右派无异，这到底是先进、还是落后呢？是不是说：王若望对反党、反社会主义“这个问题，这项工作”，已经“完全懂得”、并且“自觉地去解决它”，在反党反社会主义“这个问题、这项工作方面”，王若望是“先进”的，不应称为“落后分子”、应当称为“先进分子”？另外那些拥护党、拥护社会主义的人应称“落后分子”？这样才算黑白分明、是非分明？
    随着右派分子进攻的日益猖狂，王若望的活动也更加“自觉”和“先进”了。上海市工联召开的老工人座谈会，消息一发表，立刻受到了王若望的攻击：“不对头”。“要收了”。读者还会记得，在这个座谈会上，工人们从亲身的经验中认识到，报纸上发表的资产阶级右派的言论，是资产阶级右派向工人阶级领导权的挑战，是向社会主义道路的挑战，工人们公正地指出了我们的工作成绩是主要的；批判了李康年提出的“定息二十年”的主张，指出这正说明了“他们还缺乏把自己改造成为一个自食其力的劳动者的决心”；批判了“不要公方代表”的谬论，庄严地宣告：“不要公方代表，还让私方来领导，叫我们再回到资本主义道路上去，那我们工人谁也不会同意。”这条消息一发表，立刻受到拥护共产党领导、拥护社会主义道路的千百万人的支持。王若望却说：“这是老工人跟共产党唱对台戏”。他又说：“即使唱对台戏，我们也很欢迎”。这句话说对了，老工人的对台戏确实是同王若望的“我们”唱的。
    王若望站在他的戏台上教训老工人说：过去的报纸是“报喜不报忧”，成了“单调的片面性的报纸”，现在“我们的报纸更接近真实了”。当报纸完全变成右派的工具的时候，那才算完全“真实”、“全面”。因此，他煽动工人们：“你们也应当一同指出我们工作中的缺点”，“不能以自己工厂里的一点点感受就去否定别人的正确意见”；“不必先给人扣上一顶没有决心改造自己的帽子”；“即使没有公方代表，也未必会回到资本主义道路上去。”试问，还有那一个人曾经这样猖狂地训斥过老工人？
    王若望在党内外的会议上，大肆攻击“党内有墙”，诬蔑肃反是宗派斗争，把党的上海市委说成是对艺术毫无趣味的野人，当然是无法领导文化艺术的了。他一面把自己打扮成一个反宗派主义的英雄，一面化名“俞田”，到“文艺报”上去攻击党员作家孙峻青同志，说是孙由于周扬同志的表扬和领导上的重点培养而“身价十倍”，用捏造的“事实”，卑鄙地攻击党的领导。
    王若望的对台戏还没有唱完。但他一出场就受到了资产阶级右派分子的喝采。他的几篇杂文，成了右派分子在许多场合向党进攻的武器。“王若望替我们说话了”，这是资产阶级的赞语。王若望已经堕落到右派的泥坑，从这个泥坑里长出来的“香花”，到底是属于那一家的，不是已经很明显了吗？
