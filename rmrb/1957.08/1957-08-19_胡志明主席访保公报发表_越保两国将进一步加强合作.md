Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, August 18th: A joint communiqué on the visit of President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to Bulgaria was released here on the 17th.

The communiqué stated that during his visit to Bulgaria, President Ho Chi Minh held talks with Bulgarian state and party leaders. During the talks, both sides noted with satisfaction that cooperation between the two countries in the political, economic, and cultural fields is expanding daily, and they are determined to promote the further development of this cooperation based on the principle of mutual benefit. The basis of the talks was the desire to continuously strengthen the friendship between the peoples of Vietnam and Bulgaria, and to strengthen the unity of action among the countries of the socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union, which is a guarantee of world peace and the hope for human progress.

The two sides reached complete agreement on the exchange of views on the international situation. Both sides emphasized the need to strengthen the struggle for mutual understanding in international relations, and an important factor in this is the Soviet Union's proposal for the reduction of armed forces, the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, the immediate cessation of atomic weapons testing, and the implementation of collective security in Europe and Asia.

The representatives of Bulgaria expressed their full support for the legitimate desire of the Vietnamese people to peacefully reunify their country through general elections in accordance with the provisions of the 1954 Geneva Accords.
