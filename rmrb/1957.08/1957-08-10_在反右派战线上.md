On the Anti-Rightist Front

    Jilin Provincial People's Representatives Expose Wang Sunchu
    (Our report) Wang Sunchu, the rightist deputy director of the Jilin Provincial Department of Transportation, was exposed for his reactionary activities at a meeting of the Jilin Provincial People's Congress on the 1st. During the rectification campaign, Wang Sunchu wooed and incited some engineering and technical personnel to attack the Party Group and personnel department of the Department of Transportation. He denied the Party's leading role in engineering technology, slandered the personnel department as "advanced bricklayers for building walls, excavators for digging ditches," and "the source of sectarianism." He attacked the Party Group of the Department of Transportation as a "fortress," and he incited and wooed the rightists in the Department of Transportation to "tear down walls, fill in ditches, and open barbed wire fences" to destroy the "fortress."
    At the meeting, the representatives revealed that Wang Sunchu was a veteran Kuomintang member from 1926. When Shijiazhuang was liberated in 1948, he was captured and deserted, fleeing to the KMT-controlled area. In 1950, he had no choice but to accept a recruitment to work in the Northeast.

    Zhang Xijun Hostile to the Anti-Rightist Struggle
    Criticized at the People's Congress
    (Our report) The reactionary words and deeds of rightist Zhang Xijun were exposed at the second session of the Second Chongqing Municipal People's Congress.
    Zhang Xijun is a member of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party and the president of the First Chongqing Municipal Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine. He extremely hated the anti-rightist struggle. He once publicly said that he wanted to write an article entitled "Is it the Communist Party's Rectification or the Democratic Parties' Rectification?" and publish it.
    At this meeting, the representatives revealed that during the period of Great Blooming and Great contending, Zhang Xijun went everywhere to collect opinions from those who were dissatisfied with the Party and attacked the Party. Zhang Xijun also openly praised Zhang Bojun's "two-institute system" and Chu Anping's fallacy of "the Party's world." (Xinhua News Agency dispatch)

    Medical Workers of All Nationalities in Yunnan Province
    Denounce Rightist Zhou Zhenyun
    (Xinhua News Agency dispatch) Since late June, more than 2,000 medical workers of several ethnic groups, including Bai, Yi, Hui, and Han, in the health sector of Yunnan Province and Kunming City have used the achievements of border health undertakings to refute the reactionary remarks made by Zhou Zhenyun, the rightist deputy director of the Kunming Municipal Health Bureau, that the health work after liberation was like "Wang Xiaoer's New Year, getting worse every year," in fourteen forums and discussions. The person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Anti-epidemic Station said: "The ethnic minority areas in southern and western Yunnan were areas where malaria was extremely prevalent before liberation. Malaria took the lives of countless people, causing the destruction of famous cities such as Simao and Menglang. After liberation, the mortality rate of malaria decreased year by year, and by the end of 1956, it had dropped to 0.17%, and it is now decreasing further."

    Most Rightists in Yunnan Province's Universities and Colleges Bow Their Heads and Confess
    (Our report) The anti-rightist struggle in various universities and colleges in Yunnan Province has achieved basic victory. The vast majority of rightists are elements of the exploiting classes or come from exploiting-class families. Many of them are capitalists, landlords, and bureaucrats themselves.
    These rightists harbored strong class revenge sentiments and launched a frenzied attack by taking advantage of the Communist Party's rectification campaign.
    Beginning in mid-June, more than 8,000 faculty and staff members from four universities and colleges, under the leadership of the Party organizations in the schools, began the struggle to counterattack the rightists, exposing the true colors of the rightists, and most of them have bowed their heads and confessed.
