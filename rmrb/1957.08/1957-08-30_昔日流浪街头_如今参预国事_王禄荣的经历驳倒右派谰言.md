Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 28th. Wang Lurong, a student at Shanghai's Xuhui Middle School who was once a street urchin, used his own experiences at the Shanghai Municipal People's Congress meeting on the 27th to refute right-wing elements.

    He said, "As a youth, I absolutely cannot tolerate the right-wing elements' statements and actions that undermine socialism."

    He recalled the situation before liberation, saying, "My grandmother and mother both entered silk reeling factories as child laborers at the age of seven or eight, their hands soaking in boiling water every day to reel cocoons, scalding their skin raw. They worked hard for more than twelve hours a day, only earning forty cents. When the Japanese came, they bombed the silk factory and burned our house, leaving me to wander the streets, becoming a helpless street urchin."

    "To get a bite to eat, I worked as a waiter at a food stall, sold pancakes and fried dough sticks, and sold vegetables. I ate cold porridge and sour leftovers. Sometimes I couldn't even get that bite to eat. I wore ragged clothes and slept on the streets and in alleyways. Sometimes I was beaten and scolded by the police. We had only one way to survive: to steal, to rob, to commit crimes. At that time, how many eleven- or twelve-year-old children like me took the path of robbery for a living."

    "After liberation, the Communist Party saved us. The Party and the government used all their strength to care for us tens of thousands of homeless street children, sending us in batches to reformatories. There we had food and clothing, and we learned to read and write, sing and dance. For the first time, we lived like human beings, and for the first time, we enjoyed human warmth. Later, the Party sent us to various work and study posts. Some of us are already model workers, some are already university students, and some have even gone abroad to study."

    "In 1950, I worked as a correspondent at the Shanghai Farm Administration Bureau in the Subei Reclamation Area. Later, the organization took care of me because I was young and sent me to Xuhui District Middle School to study. During my five years of study, I received meticulous care from the Party. My tuition was completely free, and I received a student subsidy for meals. I didn't have to worry about anything myself. In the winter, I was given brand new cotton clothes. During those five years, I joined the Young Pioneers, then the Communist Youth League, and last year I gloriously joined the Chinese Communist Party. Last year, the Party and my classmates gave me the greatest honor by electing me as a representative to the Shanghai Municipal People's Congress. Without the leadership of the Party, could we have what we have today? Right-wing elements, on what basis do you say that the Party's leadership for the past eight years has been a complete mess? On what basis do you say that our country is not as good as Western democracies? On what basis do you say that the people's lives today are not as good as before?"

### 昔日流浪街头　如今参预国事　王禄荣的经历驳倒右派谰言

    昔日流浪街头　如今参预国事
　　王禄荣的经历驳倒右派谰言
    新华社上海28日电　曾经是流浪儿的上海市徐汇中学学生王禄荣在27日的上海市人民代表大会会议上，用自己的经历驳斥了右派分子。
    他说，我作为一个青年，决不能容忍右派分子破坏社会主义的言论和行动。
    他回忆解放前的情景说，我的外祖母、母亲都从七、八岁的时候就进缫丝厂当童工，双手天天泡在滚开的水中捞茧子，烫得皮破肉烂。一天辛辛苦苦工作十二小时以上，才挣得四毛钱。东洋人来了，炸了丝厂，又烧了我们的房子，使我流浪街头，成为一个无依无靠的流浪儿。
    为了混一口饭吃，我做过饭摊的伙计，卖过大饼油条，卖过菜。我吃的是冷粥馊饭。有时连这一口饭也吃不到，身上穿的是破烂的单衣，睡的是马路、弄堂。有时还要遭到巡捕的打骂，我们要活下去，只有一条路可走，就是去偷去抢，去犯罪。在当时有多少个像我一样的十一、二岁的孩子走上了抢劫为生的道路。
    解放了，是共产党救了我们。党和政府用一切力量来关怀我们这数万个无家可归的流浪儿，把我们一批批送到教养院。在那里我们有吃有穿，学习识字和唱歌跳舞。我们第一次过着人的生活，第一次享受到人间的温暖。后来党又把我们送到各个工作、学习岗位上，其中有的人已经是劳动模范，有的已经是大学生，有的还出国留学。
    我在1950年在苏北垦区上海农场管理局当了通讯员，后来组织上照顾我年纪小，送我到徐汇区中学读书。在五年的学习生活中，我受到党的无微不至的关怀，学费全免，伙食有助学金，一切都不用自己操心；到冬天又给我做好崭新的棉衣。五年中，我参加了少先队，又参加了共青团，并且在去年光荣地参加了中国共产党。去年党和同学们又给了我最大的荣誉，选我为上海市人民代表。没有党的领导，我们能有今天吗？右派分子，你们凭什么说解放八年党的领导一团糟，凭什么说我国不如西方民主，凭什么说今天人民生活不如从前。
