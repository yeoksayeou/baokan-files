Professor Wu Gengmin, who has been devoted to the study of vegetable cultivation in China for forty or fifty years, has recently completed a book of more than 500,000 words, "Chinese Vegetable Cultivation." This book has been published by the Science Press.

China's vast land and diverse climates, ranging from cold to temperate to hot, are suitable for the cultivation and growth of a variety of vegetables. For thousands of years, in order to meet the needs of life, the people have selected from within the country and introduced from abroad many kinds and varieties of vegetables suitable for local conditions and popular with the masses. This book describes more than 80 kinds of vegetables with commercial value currently cultivated in various parts of China. Among them, in addition to more than 30 kinds of major foreign vegetables that have been introduced and cultivated, such as sweet potatoes, potatoes, tomatoes, and onions, there are also more than 40 kinds of Chinese specialties that are rare or non-existent in foreign countries, such as Shandong cabbage, long-stemmed cabbage, mustard greens, kohlrabi, water spinach, chives, scallions, bamboo shoots, lettuce, amaranth, shepherd's purse, pickled mustard tuber, wild rice stem, cattail shoots, water chestnuts, water caltrop, winter melon, bean sprouts, straw mushrooms, daylily, loofah, edamame, and so on. Vegetables that have been cultivated for a long time in various parts of China often have multiple types and varieties. For example, radishes in Europe and America only have small, four-season varieties, but in China, in addition to small, four-season varieties, there are also winter radishes, spring radishes, and summer-autumn radishes, which can be cultivated and supplied in all seasons. The author provides a detailed introduction to vegetable cultivation techniques in China in this book. For example, in order to obtain early harvests, there is early-maturing cultivation; in order to extend the supply period, there is late-maturing cultivation; in order to reduce freezing in cold winter areas, there is protected cultivation, and so on. In addition, there are special cultivation methods for individual vegetables, such as soilless, light-shielded cultivation of bean sprouts, and the edible, black smut fungus parasitic cultivation of wild rice stems, all of which are achievements made by the working people of our country in vegetable cultivation through years of struggle with nature.

In this book, the author also provides a comprehensive description of the characteristics of various vegetables, the natural conditions for vegetable growth, the crops suitable for planting before and after them, as well as harvesting, storage, and seed collection methods.

    四、五十年来致力于我国蔬菜栽培研究的吴耕民教授，最近完成了一部五十多万字的著作“中国蔬菜栽培学”。这部书已经由科学出版社出版。
    我国广大的土地和寒温热多种气候，适宜于多种蔬菜的栽培和生长。几千年来，人民为满足生活上的需要，从国内选出和从国外引种的适于各地风土和群众喜爱的蔬菜种类、品种很多。这部书叙述了八十多种目前我国各地栽培的有商品价值的蔬菜，其中除有国外主要的并均已引入栽培的蔬菜如番薯（甘薯）、马铃薯、蕃茄、葱头等三十多种外，还有四十多种我国的特产是外国所少见或没有的，如山东大白菜、长梗白菜、芥菜、大头菜、水入菜、韭菜、大葱、竹笋、莴苣笋、苋菜、荠菜、榨菜、茭白、蒲菜、荸荠、菱、冬瓜、豆芽菜、草菇、金针菜、丝瓜、毛豆等等。凡经我国各地长期栽培的蔬菜，常有多种类型和多种品种。例如萝卜，欧美仅有四季小形种，但在我国除四季小形种外，还有冬萝卜、春萝卜和夏秋萝卜，可以四季栽培供应。著者在本书中对我国的蔬菜栽培技术作了详细的介绍。例如为求提早收获，有早熟栽培；为求延长供应时期，有晚熟栽培；为求在寒地冬季减除冰冻，有保护地栽培，等等。此外，对个别蔬菜还有施行特种栽培的，如豆芽菜的无土遮光栽培，茭白的食用、黑穗菌寄生栽培等，都是我国劳动人民多年同自然作斗争，在蔬菜栽培上获得的成就。
    著者在本书中对各种蔬菜的性状，蔬菜生长的自然条件和在它前后适于施种的作物以及收获、贮藏、采种方法等，也作了全面的叙述。
