This is Also a Kind of American Way of Life

　　In the United States, like in many other capitalist countries, the working people are under the exploitation and oppression of the bourgeoisie, living an increasingly impoverished life, and are often attacked by unemployment.
　　According to U.S. official estimates, in 1957, the number of unemployed people was 3.3 million, which did not include the tens of millions of partially unemployed people. The number of partially unemployed workers alone was 13 million. Even those workers who were fortunate enough to find a job, many of their incomes could not maintain the minimum living standard for a family. A report on the living conditions of low-wage residents across the country could not but admit that one-fifth of American households were living in very difficult conditions, with incomes 60% lower than the officially published minimum cost of living. In addition, 6.22 million single people were also living in dire straits, with incomes only enough to maintain a beggar-like existence. (Attached picture)

　　这也是一种美国生活方式
    在美国，像其他许多资本主义国家一样，劳动人民处在资产阶级的剥削和压迫下，过着日益穷困的生活，并经常受到失业的袭击。
    据美国官方估计，1957年失业人数有三百三十万，这并没包括成千万半失业的人数在内。半失业工人人数就有一千三百万人。就是那些侥幸求得一职的劳动者，有许多人的收入还不能维持一家的最低生活水平。一个关于全国低工资居民生活状况的报告也不能不承认。占美国总户数五分之一的人家，生活情况非常艰难，他们的收入比官方公布的最低生活费用要少60％。另外还有六百二十二万独身者的生活情况也困苦不堪，他们的收入只能维持乞丐般的生活。（附图片）
