Jiang Feng Destroys the Party's Policy on Traditional Chinese Painting
Starts Fires Everywhere, Attacks on Several Fronts, Crowns Himself King, and Consistently Resists Leadership

(Our Dispatch) The Ministry of Culture's symposium on art work continued on July 30th and August 1st. Figures in the art world continued to expose and criticize Jiang Feng's anti-Party words and deeds at the meeting.

Hua Junwu said that the Party previously criticized Jiang Feng because he violated the Party's policy on literature and art and the united front policy. Precisely because of this influence, in the past, for a considerable period of time, the art world did not pay enough attention to Chinese painting, the work of uniting Chinese painters was not done well, and publishing houses and literary and art periodicals rarely published and carried Chinese paintings. The Artists Association actually adopted a closed-door policy towards Chinese painters. Chinese painters did not receive the position they deserved in the leadership organs of the National Artists Association and local Artists Associations. Jiang Feng often used "academic issues" as a shield. Are these merely academic issues? Last April, the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee and the Party Group of the Ministry of Culture focused on criticizing this mistake. As a leader in the art world, Jiang Feng not only refused to correct his mistakes, but also insisted on violating the Party's policy, and even distorted and slandered the Party's policy, saying "now it's only about tradition, not revolution," is this also an academic issue?

Zhang Ding provided some facts about Jiang Feng's violation of the Party's principles at the Central Academy of Fine Arts. He said that in 1954, when I first arrived at the Department of Color and Ink Painting, the old Chinese painters were all studying sketching there, and they could not hold their heads high in the academy. Chinese painters could not independently formulate teaching plans and had to be approved by Western painting professors. Young teachers had very serious nihilistic ideas. They doubted whether there was anything to inherit from the national painting heritage and had no confidence in the future development of Chinese painting. Students had to be painstakingly mobilized to choose departments and subjects. That year, according to Jiang Feng's instructions, Li Zongjin organized a discussion meeting on Chinese painting by professors of the painting department. This meeting was actually an encirclement and suppression of Chinese painting. Jiang Feng and some people who agreed with him attempted to "transform" Chinese painting according to their methods. After that meeting, Chinese and Western painters became even less united. In fact, Chairman Mao had already given instructions on Chinese painting work at that time, but we didn't know, Jiang Feng didn't let us know. Comrade Zhou Yang's speech on Chinese painting issues at the National Artists Association Council, as well as Comrade Qian Junrui's suggestion on the "dual-track system" for Chinese painting teaching, were rejected by Comrade Jiang Feng. I was the Party branch secretary of the Department of Color and Ink Painting, but I couldn't hear the Party's voice in the department. Talking about the Party's policies on Chinese painting seemed illegal because it contradicted Jiang Feng's opinions. This spring, the Party Central Committee criticized Chen Qitong's articles, and Jiang Feng expressed his opposition. He said: "I used to agree with Chen Qitong, but now, my head is not a lantern and will not turn with the wind." He then put forward the so-called "revolutionary school" to oppose the Party's "blooming" policy.

Hong Bo revealed at the meeting that Jiang Feng had consistently disrespected the Party at the Central Academy of Fine Arts. Jiang Feng placed himself above the Party. He often colluded with people who had made mistakes to oppose their so-called sectarianism. Ai Zhongxin revealed that Jiang Feng's anti-Party sentiments had reached their peak recently. He said: "I am not afraid of Chairman Mao." He refused to attend the municipal party committee meeting; he didn't go to listen to Comrade Peng Zhen's report on the "blooming" policy even though he had received a ticket; recently, Premier Zhou spoke with figures in the literary and art world at Ziguang Pavilion, we urged him several times, but he resolutely refused to go.

More and more materials revealed at the meeting showed that Jiang Feng's anti-Party activities were connected to several lines. Deng Ye introduced at the meeting the truth about Jiang Feng inciting teachers and students to cause trouble at the East China Branch of the Academy of Fine Arts over the issue of relocation. The right-wing elements there, such as Jin Ye, attempted to usurp leadership, and their conspiracy activities were very rampant because they received Jiang Feng's direct support. Jiang Feng also incited Jin Ye to oppose the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee's investigation report. Chen Ruoju said that after the anti-rightist struggle was launched at the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts, the rightist Pang Xunqin reported the situation to Jiang Feng through his daughter Pang Tao (a Party member) and received Jiang Feng's support. Pang once said to Jiang Feng: "What should I do if someone says I am anti-Party?" Jiang Feng said, "Don't be afraid, I support you!" Qin Zheng, Shi Yi, Gu Hao and others revealed that Jiang Feng had personally gone deep into the oil painting training class, sculpture training class, and sculpture factory to carry out incitement against the Party's leadership. Jiang Feng also said: "I also have people in the Artists Association, I know everything they say and do." Hong Bo said that Yan Han of the Artists Association was one of the most active during the period when the rightists attacked the Party.

The meeting continued to reveal the large number of anti-Party and unfavorable to the Party and unfavorable to unity remarks that Jiang Feng spread regardless of the occasion and regardless of whether it was inside or outside the Party. Ye Qianyu said that due to the influence of Jiang Feng, many people in the art world had dissatisfaction with the Ministry of Culture. Ye Qianyu said that he himself was very dissatisfied with the "Ministry of Culture's cancellation of the Department of Color and Ink Painting." After listening to Hua Junwu's speech this time, he realized that he had been deceived by Jiang Feng. Qin Zheng said that once, Jiang Feng invited six students from the oil painting training class to his home for food and drinks. Jiang Feng told them a lot of fabricated stories about the Party Central Committee and the Party Group of the Artists Association, and attacked Premier Zhou, Zhou Yang, and Qian Junrui. Many of the content exaggerated by Jiang Feng in this conversation were later spread as news by several non-Party comrades. Jiang Feng once said to the students of the sculpture training class: "Zhou Yang rectified me during the Yan'an Rectification Movement; he is still rectifying me now. I am not afraid. This is 'political persecution'. I will fight to the end. I have a trump card, I have their old secrets." He also told the students: "The old Chinese painters in the past were all traitors. They used to oppress us, and now the Ministry of Culture still wants to let them oppress us!" He also said: "The leaders of the Ministry of Culture only know how to listen to the words of the superiors, and even a fart from the superiors is fragrant." Jiang Feng also said, "Chairman Mao only listens to one side of the story." According to Ai Zhongxin, Hong Bo, and others, Jiang Feng had a great fondness for the bourgeois parliamentary system, saying that it could play a restraining role. He was dissatisfied with the current electoral system in our country, believing that it was undemocratic.

Li Zongjin, a member of the China Democratic League, said at the meeting on the 1st that he played the role of gunner in Jiang Feng's activities to attack the Party, and also said, "After last April, Jiang Feng came to me more often." However, he did not explain the facts of his anti-Party activities. When he spoke, small notes were passed to the chairman's table one after another, asking him to explain the truth about how he acted as a "gunner."

The symposium will continue next Monday.

    江丰破坏党对国画的政策
    到处纵火，几条线分头进攻　自封为王，一贯抗拒领导
    本报讯　文化部召开的美术工作座谈会，在7月30日和8月1日继续举行。美术界人士在会上继续揭露和批判江丰的反党言行。
    华君武说，党以前批评江丰，是因为他违抗党的文艺政策和统一战线政策。正是主要由于这种影响，过去在相当长的时期内，美术界对中国画重视不够，团结国画家的工作没有作好，出版社、文艺刊物，很少出版和刊载国画作品。美协对国画家，实际上采取了关门主义态度，在全国美协及各地美协的领导机构内，国画家没有得到应得的地位。江丰常把“学术问题”作为挡箭牌，这些难道仅仅是学术问题吗？去年4月中央宣传部和文化部党组着重地批评了这种错误。作为美术界领导人的江丰，非但不愿改正错误，还坚持违抗党的政策，甚至歪曲和污蔑党的政策说“现在是只要传统，不要革命了”，难道这也是学术问题吗？
    张仃提供了江丰在中央美术学院违抗党的方针的一些事实。他说，1954年，我刚到彩墨画系时，老国画家们都在那里进修学习素描，他们在院内抬不起头来。国画家不能独立订教学计划，必须经过西画教授们的核准。青年教员虚无主义思想很严重，他们怀疑民族绘画遗产有什么可继承的，对国画发展的前途没有信心。同学们选系选科要煞费动员。那一年李宗津根据江丰的指示，组织了一次绘画系教授关于国画的讨论会，这次会实际上是对国画的一次围剿。江丰和同他主张一致的一些人，企图按照他们的方法“改造”国画。从那次会后，中西画家更不团结了。其实，那时毛主席关于国画工作早已有了指示，可是我们不知道，江丰不让我们知道。周扬同志在全国美协理事会上，关于国画问题的讲话，以及钱俊瑞同志关于国画教学“双轨制”的建议遭到江丰同志的拒绝。我是彩墨画系党支部书记，可是在系里听不到党的声音。谈到党在国画方面的方针政策，好像是非法的，因为这与江丰的意见相抵触。今年春天，党中央批评了陈其通等人的文章，江丰表示反对。他说：“我过去是同意陈其通的，现在，我的脑袋不是灯笼，也不会随风转。”他当时提出所谓“革命学派”来对抗党的“百花齐放”的方针。
    洪波在会上揭露了江丰在中央美术学院，一贯不尊重党，江丰把
  自己摆在党之上，他常常和犯过错误的人勾结一起，来反对他们所谓的宗派主义。艾中信揭发说：江丰的反党情绪，在最近期间，发展到了顶点。他说过：“毛主席我也不怕。”市委的会议，他拒绝参加；彭真同志作关于“百花齐放”政策的报告，发了票，他不去听；最近周总理在紫光阁同文艺界人士讲话，我们几次三番催他，他坚决不去。
    会上揭露的愈来愈多的材料说明，江丰的反党活动，联系着好几条线。邓野在会上介绍了江丰在华东美术分院就迁校问题煽动师生闹事的真相。那里的右派分子金冶等企图篡夺领导权的阴谋活动，因为得到江丰的直接支持，十分嚣张。江丰还煽动金冶反对浙江省委的调查报告。陈若菊说：中央工艺美术学院反右派斗争展开后，右派分子庞熏琴通过他女儿庞涛（党员）向江丰汇报情况，得到江丰的支持。庞曾对江丰说：“如果有人说我反党，怎么办？”江丰说，“不要怕，我支持你！”秦征、时宜、谷浩等揭发，江丰曾亲自深入到油画训练班、雕塑训练班和雕塑工厂进行反对党的领导的煽动。江丰还说过：“美协我也有人，他们一言一动，我都知道。”洪波说，美协的彦涵，就是在右派分子向党进攻期间最积极活动的一个。
    会上继续揭发江丰不择场合、不分党内党外，散布的大量反党的和不利于党、不利于团结的言论。叶浅予说，由于受了江丰的影响，美术界许多人对文化部有不满情绪。叶浅予说他本人对“文化部要取消彩墨画系”很为不满。这一次听了华君武的发言，才知道是受了江丰的欺骗。秦征说，有一次，江丰邀了油画训练班的六个学生，到他家里吃喝。江丰向他们讲了大量经过制造的关于党中央的、美协党组的事情，并且对周总理、周扬和钱俊瑞进行攻击。这次谈话的许多被江丰夸大了的内容，事后为几个非党同志当作新闻来传播。江丰曾向雕塑训练班的学生说：“延安整风时，周扬搞我；现在，还在搞。我不怕。这是‘政治陷害’。我要斗争到底。我有王牌，我有他们的老底。”他还向学生们说：“过去的老国画家都是汉奸，从前他们压在我们头上，现在文化部还要让他们压在我们头上！”还说：“文化部的领导只晓得听上面的话，上面放一个屁也是香的。”江丰还说，“毛主席偏听偏信。”据艾中信、洪波等揭发，江丰对资产阶级议会制很有好感，说可以起牵制作用。他对现在我国的选举制度不满，认为不民主。
    民盟盟员李宗津在1日的会上说，在江丰向党进攻的活动中，他起了炮手的作用，又说，“去年4月以后，江丰来找我的机会多了。”可是他并没有交代他的反党活动的事实。在他发言的时候，小条子一张接一张地递到主席台上，要求他交代怎么充当“炮手”的真相。
    座谈会将在下星期一继续举行。
