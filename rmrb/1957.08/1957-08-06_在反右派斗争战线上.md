On the Anti-Rightist Struggle Front

    Henan Democratic Parties' Organizations Deepen the Anti-Rightist Struggle at the Grassroots Level

    (Xinhua News Agency Special) Democratic parties' organizations in Henan Province have extensively launched the anti-Rightist struggle. The exposed Rightists Wang Yizhai (China Democratic League), Li Jingzhi (Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang), Zhang Jingwu (China Democratic League), Liu Jixue (Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang), Song Yuxiu (Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang), Wu Zhanggeng, Yu Pinsan (China National Democratic Construction Association) are the heads and key members of the Rightists in the local organizations of democratic parties in Henan Province.

    Some of these Rightist key members have lowered their heads and confessed their guilt, some are writing self-criticism materials, and some are being further exposed. A number of Rightists have also been exposed in the grassroots organizations of democratic parties in various places. At present, the leading core of the Leftists has been initially formed in the local organizations of various democratic parties in Henan Province. The anti-Rightist struggle is being universally deepened in various branches and groups.

    Luo Bin's Slander of Marxism-Leninism is Bitterly Denounced

    (Our newspaper's Lanzhou dispatch) All staff members of the Propaganda Department, the Department of Culture and Education, and the United Front Work Department of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China jointly held a meeting to launch a struggle against the Rightist Luo Bin within the Party. Luo Bin is the deputy director of the Intellectuals Office of the Propaganda Department. When the Rightists attacked the Party, he attacked Marxism-Leninism in the name of giving opinions to the Party. He slandered the study of Marxism-Leninism as "giving people a kind of spiritual slavery," and said that Marxism-Leninism is an old saying that appeared a hundred years ago, and now people who believe in Marxism-Leninism are like believers who are pious to the scriptures. Luo Bin also slandered the Gansu Provincial Party Committee, and he arbitrarily asserted: "From the secretary to the minister, they are all laymen in culture and art."

    Liu Womou's Conspiracy is Exposed

    (Our newspaper's Fuzhou dispatch, August 5th) The staff of the Fuzhou Shipping Administration Office of the Shipping Administration Bureau of the Fujian Provincial Department of Transportation have held more than ten meetings in the past few days to expose and criticize the reactionary remarks and deeds of Liu Womou, the Rightist deputy director of the office.

    Liu Womou maliciously compared the relationship between the Shipping Administration Bureau and the boat people to "the fisherman and the cormorant," saying that "the fisherman is holding the cormorant's throat too tightly." The state-owned transportation department allocated very few goods to the boat people, and the income of the wooden sailing boat transportation cooperative has been greatly reduced, plotting to incite the boat people to make trouble.

    At the meeting, the staff unanimously refuted Liu Womou's reactionary remarks. Lin Kaiming of the Provincial Shipping Administration Bureau refuted Liu Womou's absurd arguments with the fact that the state-owned allocation of goods to the boat people has increased over the years, and the labor remuneration of the members has increased year by year. Many people also angrily questioned Liu Womou's intention in consistently stirring up trouble and provoking relations between the Party and the masses.

    洛滨污蔑马列主义遭到痛斥
    本报兰州讯　中共甘肃省委宣传部、文教部、统战部的全体工作人员，联合举行大会，向党内右派分子洛滨展开斗争。洛滨是宣传部知识分子办公室副主任，在右派分子向党进攻的时候，他以向党提意见为名，攻击马列主义，他诬蔑马列主义学习是“给人一种精神奴役”，还说，马列主义是一百年以前就出现的陈词，而现在信仰马列主义的人仿佛教徒对教经的虔诚一般。洛滨还污蔑甘肃省委，他武断地肯定：“连书记带部长在文化艺术上都是外行。”
    刘我谋的阴谋被揭穿
    本报福州5日电　福建省交通厅航运管理局福州航运管理处职工，连日召开十多次会议，揭露和批判该处副处长右派分子刘我谋的反动言行。
    刘我谋曾恶意地把航管局与船民的关系比作“渔翁与鸬鹚”，说“渔翁把鸬鹚的喉咙卡得太紧”，国营运输部门分配给船民的货源很少，木帆船运输合作社收入大大减少了，阴谋煽动船民闹事。
    会上职工们一致驳斥了刘我谋的反动言论。省航管局林开明用历年来国营分配给船民的货源增加，社员的劳动报酬逐年提高等事实驳斥了刘我谋的荒谬论调。许多人还愤怒地质问刘我谋一贯搬弄是非、挑拨党群关系的用意何在。
