　　A Record of the Chunhua Pavilion Modelbook Steles
　　Dai Zhankui
    Last August, I visited the Xi'an Ancient Artifacts Exhibition Hall three times, and I lingered even more at the Forest of Steles there.
    The exhibition hall is converted from the old Prefectural School, and the old Prefectural School was the Imperial Academy of the Sui Dynasty, which was expanded and renovated during the Zhenguan period (630 AD) of the fourth year of the reign of Emperor Taizong of Tang. The academy houses the Stele of Confucius' Temple Hall, written by Yu Shinan in the ninth year of Wude (626 AD) of Emperor Gaozu of Tang, the Stone Platform Classic of Filial Piety, written in the second year of Tianbao (743 AD) of Emperor Minghuang, the Stone Wall Nine Classics presented by Zheng Tan and others in the second year of Kaicheng, Zhang Can's Five Classics Texts, and so on. Around the thirty-fifth year of Qianlong (1770) of Emperor Gaozong of Qing, Bi Yuan, the Governor of Shaanxi, said in his "Gazetteer of Famous Sites in Guanzhong":
    "…Furthermore, since the Song and Yuan Dynasties, the Prefectural School has moved all the steles and inscriptions that were abandoned in the suburbs, fields, temples, and monasteries to the school, so people at that time called it the Stele Cave, also known as the Forest of Steles. The steles, from Qin and Sui to Yuan, number about seventy kinds. …Since taking office, I have repeatedly ordered the relevant departments to build pavilions to protect them from wind and rain, and to prevent them from being damaged by neglect. The winding corridors and galleries are arranged in sequence, so that researchers can have something to see."
    Among the stele types, Bi Yuan did not mention the Chunhua Pavilion Modelbook steles. This may be because the collection in the Xi'an Forest of Steles is a re-engraved copy by Fei Jiazhu in the third year of Shunzhi (1646) of Emperor Shizu of Qing, based on the modelbook carved by the Su Prince's Mansion. In the mid-Qing Dynasty, Bi Yuan had not yet moved them to the Prefectural School at that time. The steles number one hundred and forty-five, all engraved on both sides, and stacked vertically with cement mortar and bricks. One of them is placed upside down, which may be due to oversight and failure to correct it at the time.
    The original Chunhua Secret Pavilion Modelbook was ordered by Emperor Taizong Zhao Guangyi of Song in the third year of Chunhua (992 AD) to have Wang Zhu copy the calligraphy of emperors and famous officials of past dynasties collected in the inner court onto wooden boards. The boards were kept in the inner court, and rubbings were distributed to various ministers. Half of the rubbings are seal, cursive, and regular scripts of emperors and famous officials; the other half are cursive scripts of the Two Wangs (Wang Xizhi and Wang Xianzhi). Less than a hundred years after their engraving, the versions were damaged and destroyed, and the original rubbings were not easy to obtain. From the Song to the Ming dynasties, many public and private copies were engraved. When Emperor Taizu Zhu Hongwu of Ming established his fiefdoms, he gave true rubbings to his son, Prince Zhuang of Su. In the forty-third year of Wanli (1615), the descendant of Prince Zhuang of Su, Prince Xian, ordered the original rubbings to be traced and re-engraved on stone, and placed in the Jiyuan Garden within the Su Prince's Mansion in Yunzhou. In late August, I went to Lanzhou and learned that the original stele engravings were stored in the Provincial No. 2 Middle School. This school was also converted from a Confucian temple, and the steles were stored on the three sides of the corridor eaves of the Sutra Depository behind the Confucian temple. They are arranged on wooden frames, in five horizontal rows. It is said that there are about two hundred stele engravings, but according to my count, there are only one hundred and twenty-five. They are also engraved on both sides, and roughly one-third or more are damaged, broken, or incomplete. The bottom row is wood-carved, the wood is firm, and the carving is exquisite, with occasional cracks. The exposed parts of the racks are slightly covered with paper; in terms of preservation, this cannot prevent wind and rain erosion.
    At that time, I made three suggestions to Governor Deng Baoshan: (1) Within the scope of the cultural relics museum in the Five Springs Mountain Scenic Area, the steles should be moved there, following the example of the Xi'an Forest of Steles; (2) The damaged ones should be repaired, and the missing ones should be meticulously copied according to the original rubbings; (3) The steles and inscriptions abandoned in the No. 2 Middle School and other places that have preservation value should be moved there. Governor Deng Baoshan expressed his agreement and said that the stone carvings written by Huai Su were also planned to be handled together. I have been back to Beijing for a year, and I don't know how this matter is progressing.

　　记淳化阁帖碑石
　　戴占奎
    去年八月，我曾到过西安古物陈列馆三次，对于那里的碑林更多留恋。
    陈列馆系旧府学改建，而旧府学就是隋时的国子监，贞观四年（630）间增修。监中藏有唐高祖武德九年（626）虞世南所书夫子庙堂碑，明皇天宝二年（743）所书石台孝经，开成二年郑覃等所进石壁九经，张参五经文字，等等。清高宗乾隆三十五年（1770）左右，陕西巡抚毕沅在他所纂“关中胜迹图志”中曾说：
    “……又府学自宋元以来，凡郊野寺观所有碑题刻石，委弃榛莽者皆舁至学中，故时人呼之为碑洞，亦谓之为碑林。其碑自秦隋至元，约计七十种。………自莅任以来，每饬有司增亭建立，勿为风雨所侵，亦勿令有侦仆之患，回廊曲榭，挨次比肩，庶考古者，得以有所观览也。”
    在碑种中，毕沅未曾提到淳化阁帖碑石。这可能是因为西安碑林所藏是清世祖顺治三年（1646）费甲铸氏依肃府刻本再摹刻的，而在清中叶，毕沅尚未将它们移到当时的府学。碑石计一百四十五方，都是两面刻，用水泥砂浆和砖直列砌置。中有一块倒置，这可能是由于当时疏忽且未校正所致。
    淳化秘阁帖原始本由宋太宗赵光义在淳化三年（992）取内府所藏历代帝王名臣法书命王著摹勒在木板上。板存内府，而以拓本分赐诸大臣。拓本一半是帝王名臣的篆、草、真字；另一半是二王（羲之、献之）的草书。刻成不到百年、版本残毁、而原拓本也不易得。由宋至明，公私复刻很多。明太祖朱洪武建藩时，曾将真拓本给他的儿子肃庄王。万历四十三年（1615），肃庄王后裔宪王命将原赐的拓本钩出，并复刻石上，置于芸州肃王府内的节园。八月下旬我到兰州，寻知原碑刻藏置在省立第二中学内。这所学校也系文庙改建，碑石藏在文庙后的藏经阁三面廊檐上。用木架排列，横成五行。据说碑刻约有二百块、但是据我所计只有一百二十五块。它们也都是两面刻，粗计损坏破裂不完整的约占三分之一以上。最下一列是木刻的，木质坚、刻工精，间有破裂。排架外露部分用纸略为遮盖；以保管论，这是不能避免风雨侵蚀的。
    当时，我曾向邓宝珊省长提了三点建议：（一）在五泉山风景区文物馆范围内，仿西安碑林办法将这些碑石移置；（二）已破损的修复，短缺的照原拓本精工摹刻；（三）第二中学内和其他各处所委弃而有保存价值的碑题刻石都应移到那里。邓宝珊省长深表同意，并说还有怀素所书的石刻也拟一并处理。我回京已一年了，不知此事进行如何。
