    Wen Hui Bao Employees Expose Rong Zhengchang
    (Dispatch from our newspaper) Employees of Shanghai's Wen Hui Bao and the Shanghai Peking Opera Company have recently held meetings for several days to expose and criticize the fact that Rong Zhengchang (member of the China Democratic League), a reporter for Wen Hui Bao, used the opportunity of the Party's rectification campaign to collude with right-wing elements of the China Democratic League inside and outside the newspaper to attack the Party.
    Wen Hui Bao employees revealed: The fires that Wen Hui Bao started in units such as the Shanghai People's Art Theater, the Shanghai Peking Opera Company, the Shanghai Film Studio, and the Shanghai Science and Education Film Studio were almost all started by Rong Zhengchang. Rong also accepted instructions from right-wing elements Xu Zhucheng and Song Yunbin and went to Hangzhou twice to start fires.
    Rong Zhengchang once said arrogantly at an interview meeting: "As long as my head is on my shoulders, I will report (referring to reports that start fires and oppose the Party)." Before Rong Zhengchang went to the Science and Education Film Studio to start a fire, the person in charge of the Science and Education Film Studio had told him: Zhao Guozhang (right-wing element) is dissatisfied with the Party. Rong insisted on going to Zhao frequently. He used Zhao to start a fire at the Science and Education Film Studio, deliberately writing reports that distorted the facts.
    Zhou Xinfang, Tong Zhiling, Li Yuru, Ji Yuliang, Jin Suwen and others from the Shanghai Peking Opera Company unanimously exposed that Rong Zhengchang's reports on the Peking Opera Company distorted the facts and fabricated things out of thin air.
    Rong Zhengchang has always hated the Party. Since the beginning of the anti-rightist struggle, he has continued to resist stubbornly and refuses to confess honestly. All employees of Wen Hui Bao want him to bow his head and confess his crimes thoroughly.

    文汇报职工揭发容正昌
    本报讯　上海文汇报和京剧院职工最近连日集会，揭发和批判文汇报记者容正昌（民盟盟员）利用党整风的机会，勾结报社内外的民盟右派分子向党进攻的事实。
    文汇报职工揭发：文汇报在上海人民艺术剧院、上海京剧院、上海电影制片厂、上海科学教育电影制片厂等单位放的火，差不多都是由容正昌去放的。容还接受右派分子徐铸成、宋云彬的指使，两次到杭州去放火。
    容正昌曾公开在采访会议上狂妄地说：“只要头长在我的身上，我就要报道，（指放火、反党的报道）”。容正昌到科影去放火之前，科影负责人曾告诉过他：赵国璋（右派分子）是对党不满的。容却偏偏经常去找赵。通过赵向科影放火，故意写出歪曲事实的报道。
    上海京剧院的周信芳、童芷苓、李玉茹、纪玉良、金素雯等人一致揭露容正昌对京剧院的报道是歪曲事实、无中生有。
    容正昌一贯仇视党，反右派斗争开始到现在，他仍负隅顽抗，不肯老实交代，文汇报全体职工要他低头伏罪，彻底交代。
