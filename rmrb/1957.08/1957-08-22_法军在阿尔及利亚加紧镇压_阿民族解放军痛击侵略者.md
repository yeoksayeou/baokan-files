Fierce battles have taken place in the departments of Oran and Constantine.

On August 17, French paratroopers, colonial troops, and security forces checked the documents of 3,000 people in Algiers, and about twenty Algerians were arrested. On August 18, French troops arrested 150 Algerians in the department of Constantine under the pretext that a vehicle of French police officers had been ambushed. In addition, the French military court in Algiers also sentenced two Algerian patriots to death. (Attached picture)
