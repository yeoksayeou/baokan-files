    An Analysis of the Anti-Party Conspiracy of the Zhang-Luo Alliance
    Zhu Xuefan
    In the struggle against the rightists, after investigations from various sources, it was discovered that the anti-Party activities of the Zhang-Luo alliance were particularly egregious. Based on my own study and participation in the struggle, I will write some personal views.
    Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji and other rightist elements, taking advantage of the Chinese Communist Party's rectification movement, launched a frenzied wave of attacks against the Party throughout the country. The Zhang-Luo anti-Party alliance was not formed during the Party's rectification period, but had secretly joined together as early as last year. Why did Zhang and Luo, who in the past had been fighting fiercely and unwilling to give way to each other within the Democratic League in order to seize leadership, yield to each other and collude to form an alliance last year?
    In addition to their common and consistent anti-communist ideological foundation, it was also because they misjudged the changes in the domestic and international situation in the past year. They mistakenly believed that the situation was developing greatly to the disadvantage of the Communist Party. So their tails were up. They attempted to create a rebellion in China similar to the Hungarian incident, and then come out to "clean up the mess." In order to conspire to do great things, Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji combined with each other and formed an anti-Party alliance. What exactly did this anti-Party alliance want to do?
　  (1) The Reactionary Political Program of the Zhang-Luo Alliance - They Wanted to Change Our Country's Socialist Path
    Socialism is the common ideal of the Chinese people's long-term revolutionary struggle, and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, it has become a living reality. It has transformed the poor, backward, semi-feudal, and semi-colonial old China into a new China that is independent, prosperous, free, democratic, and happy. Taking the socialist road is the inevitable law of China's historical development, and it cannot be changed by any small number of political ambitionists.
    Bourgeois right-wing elements do not think the same as the people. They do not think that socialism is so good, but they dare not openly slander socialism in front of the people. Under the insincere guise of "I love socialism," Zhang Bojun used obscure and ambiguous words to immediately say what was on his mind: "I also love democracy." Naturally, everyone loves democracy, but the question is what kind of democracy, bourgeois democracy or socialist democracy? What kind of democracy do Zhang and Luo love? They themselves have made it very clear. Zhang Bojun said: "American politics is democratic, but the economy is not democratic; the Soviet Union's economy is democratic, but the politics are not democratic." Luo Longji also sang the same tune: "Although bourgeois democracy has its shortcomings, it also has its advantages; although the proletarian dictatorship also has its advantages, it always feels like something is missing." Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji just wanted to build a capitalist superstructure on the socialist economic foundation. Since socialism does not conform to their ideals, and socialism and bourgeois democracy cannot be combined into a political hybrid, the conclusion can only be to eliminate socialism and restore capitalism.
        They Wanted to Abolish the People's Democratic Dictatorship System
    Why does Zhang Bojun love capitalist democracy so much? He answered this question in his speech when conveying Chairman Mao's Ten Great Policies to the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party. He said: Many people now say that capitalism is not good, but in fact, capitalism still has vitality. Why is it still vital? Because there is a multi-party system, a democratic system, a House of Representatives and a Senate, and a party in power and a party out of power. The method in capitalist countries is: if you can't do it, I'll do it; if I can't do it, you'll do it. The party in power scolds the party out of power, and the party out of power scolds the party in power, and this is "vitality." Our country is a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. It is not the two-house parliamentary system of capitalist countries, nor is it a system of rotation of power among various parties. Bourgeois right-wing elements believe that the political system of socialist countries is not democratic enough, or that it is not democratic enough. No wonder Zhang Bojun brazenly proposed the reactionary idea of establishing a "Political Design Institute" at a forum convened by the United Front Work Department.
    Zhang Bojun painstakingly wanted to set up a supreme institution, the "Political Design Institute," above the highest organ of state power—the National People's Congress. He wanted to give the democratic parties the power to veto the national policies and guidelines proposed by the Communist Party through the National People's Congress. This painstaking design was actually to overthrow the basic political system of the National People's Congress stipulated by our country's constitution.
    Why are bourgeois right-wing elements so deliberately trying to abolish the people's democratic dictatorship? This is easy to understand, because under the people's democratic dictatorship, only the people can fully enjoy broad democratic rights, while the enemies of socialism are deprived of their political rights and subjected to dictatorship. The right-wing elements believe that this is not democratic enough, and that democracy has been "damaged." So they appear as "defenders" of democracy, wanting to "make democracy develop soundly."
    They Wanted to Seize the Leadership of the Chinese Communist Party
    The right-wing elements know that to abolish the people's democratic dictatorship, they must abolish the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, because the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party is the basic guarantee for realizing the people's democratic dictatorship and building socialism.
      Since the Chinese Communist Party put forward the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" for the democratic parties last year, the bourgeois right-wing elements absurdly thought that they could raise the status of the democratic parties and confront the leading party on an equal footing. They were blinded by their interests and forgot that the people's democratic dictatorship is a class alliance under the leadership of the working class, and even more forgot that the political parties representing the interests of various classes must accept the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, which is a basic condition of the people's democratic dictatorship. Zhang Bojun said: "If the democratic parties progress, they don't need too much help from the United Front Work Department. Today, the democratic parties have political freedom and organizational independence, so they don't need to rely on the Communist Party in their work." According to him, "this is in line with the laws of the development of the times." At the national working conference of the Democratic League in April this year, he even arrogantly uttered the extremely reactionary words "Duke Zhou assisting King Cheng." He compared the democratic parties to King Cheng and the Chinese Communist Party to Duke Zhou. He said that King Cheng has now grown up, and if he is not allowed to be independent, the benefactor will become the enemy.
    The objective law of the development of the times is that whether it is the Democratic League that took the third road in the past, or the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party that was "three parts anti-Communist and seven parts anti-Chiang" in the past, they must ultimately accept the leadership of the Communist Party. Any democratic party that wants to break away from the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party will inevitably deviate from the socialist track and be spurned by the people of the whole country.
    They Oppose the Ideological Leadership of Marxism-Leninism
    Since the bourgeois right-wing elements oppose the Chinese Communist Party, which leads the people of the whole country in socialist construction, in politics, they will inevitably be unwilling to accept the scientific theory of Marxism-Leninism in ideology, because the Chinese Communist Party is a political party of the working class armed with Marxism-Leninism. Combining theory with China's specific conditions, it successfully ended the new democratic revolution and basically completed the socialist revolution.
    When the Chinese Communist Party put forward the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," the right-wing elements, in the name of opposing "dogmatism," shamelessly distorted and recklessly attacked Marxism-Leninism. Zhang Bojun said that Marxism-Leninism was worthless, not even as good as China's feudal culture thousands of years ago. When the CCP Central Committee called for studying Marxism-Leninism, he said: "I think the Book of Songs and the Analects are still useful, but Marxism-Leninism only has a few articles, and I am not interested in it, it is not worth studying." What did he want to do if he didn't want to study Marxism-Leninism? He said he wanted to create a set of "new humanism" and planned to stage a "Renaissance" in the new China. He repeatedly declared that he wanted to strive for "spiritual freedom" and especially emphasized "independent thinking." Luo Longji has always hated ideological remolding. He said: "I can write articles on Marxism-Leninism without studying it." In his view, "upright" intellectuals are those who retain bourgeois ideology. He even maliciously provoked the relationship between intellectuals and the Communist Party on this issue. He said that the distance between intellectuals and the Party was created by the ideological remolding movement. When he talked about the issue of intellectuals at the CPPCC, he did not help intellectuals from a positive perspective or strengthen ideological remolding, but catered to the backward consciousness of intellectuals, saying that they should be treated with "courtesy" and "visit their thatched cottages three times."
    The reason why bourgeois right-wing elements want to oppose studying Marxism-Leninism and oppose the ideological remolding movement is only to preserve the last ideological front of capitalism for the restoration of capitalism.
    They Oppose Proletarian Internationalism
    Since the Zhang-Luo alliance opposes the Chinese Communist Party and opposes Marxism-Leninism, then in their foreign relations, they will inevitably take the road of opposing the Soviet Union.
    Zhang Bojun's anti-Soviet ideas have been around for a long time, and have become more blatant in the past year. He said that the Soviet Union is no good at anything except heavy industry, and at the same time, he believes that the capitalist system still has a future. Therefore, where will the world ultimately go? He believes that it is still worth studying. Luo Longji has always hated the Soviet Union and followed a pro-American line. On the eve of the national liberation, he also proposed a policy of coordinated diplomacy and did not agree with leaning to the Soviet Union. After liberation, he still wanted to be anti-Soviet and pro-American. Especially after the Polish and Hungarian incidents, he was even more speculative about Zhang Bojun's anti-Soviet rhetoric.
    Opposing socialism, opposing the people's democratic dictatorship, opposing the leadership of the Communist Party, opposing the ideological leadership of Marxism-Leninism, and opposing proletarian internationalism are the extremely reactionary political programs of the Zhang-Luo alliance. Under this reactionary political program, they formed an alliance and launched conspiratorial activities in a meticulous, planned, and step-by-step manner starting last year.
    (2) The Strategic Policy of the Zhang-Luo Alliance to Attack the Party - Controlling and Developing Organizations, Expanding Political Capital
    In order to realize their sinister conspiracy against the Party and socialism, the Zhang-Luo alliance had long been actively preparing organizational forces, and once the time was ripe, they would launch a full-scale attack on the Party.
    After Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji formed an alliance, the first thing they wanted to do was to usurp the leadership of the Central Committee of the Democratic League, attempting to make Chairman Shen Junru retire as honorary chairman. Zhang Bojun would become the chairman and Luo Longji would become the executive vice chairman. In terms of personnel arrangements, they would squeeze out progressive elements and win over right-wing elements. They placed Zeng Zhaolun in the Cultural and Educational Committee and Fei Xiaotong in the Cultural and Educational Department in order to stir up trouble in the cultural and educational circles. At the same time, Zhang Bojun strengthened the leadership of right-wing elements in the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party. Regardless of others' opposition, he insisted on appointing Huang Qixiang as the vice chairman of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, and transferred Li Boqiu to Beijing to serve as the director of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party. In this way, a leading group of right-wing elements headed by Zhang Bojun, Huang, and Li was formed within the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party.
    From the time the Zhang-Luo alliance was formed, they clamored for the democratic parties to develop greatly, in order to find political capital for the capitalism they longed for. Zhang Bojun said: "The more members an organization has, the greater its strength, and the more money it can sell for." They wanted the democratic parties to develop to 1 or 2 million members, so that they could confront the Communist Party on an equal footing.
    How did the Zhang-Luo alliance implement their policy of great development? The methods and approaches were varied. Many were very bad. There was "grabbing famous brands," "casting a wide net," and "opening the door to the backward," etc. In order to win over some representative figures and raise the status of the democratic parties, they even spared no expense, using various means such as visiting their homes and inviting them to dinner, and promising that they would not have to write autobiographies or attend any meetings. In order to develop the organization, they could ignore the political affiliations of the objects of development, and they were also looking for people who were dissatisfied with the Communist Party everywhere. They adopted the "line" of accepting anyone who came, the more the better. Within the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, Zhang Bojun even recruited a group of people who had been subjected to labor reform and control to expand their "ranks."
    Seizing Newspapers and Periodicals as Tools for Anti-Party Activities
    While the Zhang-Luo alliance was developing greatly in organization, it was also expanding propaganda and agitation on the ideological front. They wanted to use newspapers to serve their despicable political purposes. In the two months that Chu Anping was the editor-in-chief of Guangming Daily, he tampered with the political orientation of this organ of the democratic parties. After Zhang Bojun appointed Chu Anping as the editor-in-chief of Guangming Daily, he planned to reorganize the personnel of the newspaper. Zhang Bojun also agreed to Luo Longji's introduction of the right-wing "theoretician" Chen Xingui to Guangming Daily as editor-in-chief, while Chu Anping served as the deputy director of the newspaper. Luo Longji also agreed to Zhang Bojun's proposal to organize an "advisory group" for Guangming Daily, composed of Luo Longji, Fei Xiaotong, Qian Weichang, and others. They consciously squeezed out Party members and CYL members within the newspaper and strengthened the forces of right-wing elements in order to turn the organ of the democratic parties into the organ of the Zhang-Luo alliance.
　　In addition to controlling Guangming Daily through Chu Anping, the Zhang-Luo alliance also controlled Shanghai's Wenhui Daily through the relationships of Luo Longji, Pu Xixiu, and Xu Zhucheng. Pu Xixiu often consulted with Luo Longji, and with Zhang Bojun during Luo Longji's absence abroad.
    The Zhang-Luo alliance not only seized newspapers, but also did not relax its grip on periodicals. They also seized the "Contending" monthly magazine prepared by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Democratic League and turned it into a political publication, which was used in coordination with the Guangming Daily and Wenhui Daily as a propaganda tool for the Zhang-Luo alliance against the Party, against the people, and against socialism.
    Setting Fires Everywhere and Attacking the Party
    The Zhang-Luo alliance's attack on the Party began by provoking the relationship between the cultural and educational circles, scientific and technical personnel, and the Party. They slandered the Party for being unable to lead intellectuals and unable to lead science and technology. While our country is in the process of realizing socialist industrialization, senior intellectuals and scientific and technical personnel will play an important role, but Zhang Luo provoked their relationship with the Party. In particular, they used a few relatively backward intellectuals who were dissatisfied with the past few movements, or who had opinions on their living treatment. The Zhang-Luo alliance deliberately spoke out for these people in order to win their favor, expand the organization and political influence of the anti-Party alliance, and use it as political capital for attacking the Party.
    Not long after the rectification movement began, they neither asked for instructions from Chairman Shen Junru nor consulted with the other two vice chairmen, and even without the decision of the Standing Committee, they used the name of the Central Committee of the Democratic League to set up four working groups: "Scientific Planning," "Party Committee System in Universities and Colleges," "Long-term Coexistence and Mutual Supervision," and "Having a Position but No Power." These working groups were all responsible for convening forums and drafting outlines by senior intellectuals of the Democratic League. Tao Dayong, one of the core members of the Zhang-Luo alliance, put forward the highest program and lowest program of "democratic school management," attempting to fundamentally abolish the party committee system in schools. Fei Xiaotong, Zeng Zhaolun, and Qian Weichang, core members of the Zhang-Luo alliance, put forward a program against the Party's leadership of science, negated the socialist education line, and provoked the relationship between the Party and scientists.
    The emergency meeting of six professors convened by Zhang Bojun at the Cultural Club of the CPPCC on June 6, including Zeng Zhaolun, Qian Weichang, Fei Xiaotong, Tao Dayong, Wu Jingchao, and Huang Yaomian, can be said to be the culmination of their anti-Party activities. They made an extremely absurd assessment of the current situation. They said that it is a tradition for Chinese intellectuals to make trouble. From the students of the Imperial College in the Han Dynasty to the May Fourth Movement, it was all started by students. Zhang Bojun said at the meeting: "If university students continue to make trouble like this, there may be an event like the Hungarian incident. If students take to the streets and get together with citizens, things will be difficult to handle." They believed that the Communist Party had "lost the hearts of the people" and that the Communist Party "can release but cannot take back, and it would take three million troops to take it back, but the hearts of the people have been lost." Therefore, they believed that it was time to speak to the Party, and they wanted to carry out political blackmail by helping the Party clean up the mess. The right-wing elements, dizzy with ambition,妄想动摇我国的人民民主政权, 真如蚍蜉撼大树, 未免太自不量力了。(foolishly dreamed of shaking our country's people's democratic regime, which is really like an ant trying to shake a big tree, it is too much to overestimate their abilities.)
    The Zhang-Luo alliance adopted the method of "breaking through a point and promoting the whole" to launch an attack on the Party. Beijing was one of the key targets of their attack.
    Advancing Separately, Plotting for Right-Wing Elements in Various Places to Attack the Party at the Same Time
    While the Central Committee of the Democratic League, under the control of the Zhang-Luo alliance, launched an offensive against the Party, the right-wing elements in the local organizations of the Democratic League also launched a frenzied attack on the Party from various places. The Luo Longji clique controlled many strongholds in the local organizations of the Democratic League, such as Chen Renbing and Peng Wenyin in Shanghai, Pan Dakui in the Southwest, Ma Zhemin in Hubei, Du Maizhi in Hunan, Jiang Zhenzhong in Zhejiang, Wang Wenguang in Taiyuan, and Chen Yangzhi in Qingdao, who all rose up to launch a frenzied attack on the Party at this time.
    Guangming Daily and Wenhui Daily, which were directly controlled by the Zhang-Luo alliance, sent additional reporters to major cities to set fires, and also went deep into the grassroots, deep into the counties, and deep into primary and secondary schools, disrupting the CCP's rectification steps, provoking the relationship between the Party and the masses, and creating social chaos.
    The Zhang-Luo alliance's attack on the Party had a division of labor. The Shanghai right-wing elements carried out activities according to the method of "talking about what they are good at." For example, Chen Renbing and Peng Wenyin seized the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Democratic League and the literary and art circles, Wang Zaoshi and Yang Zhaolong attacked judicial work, Lu Yi seized news work, and Sun Dayu and Xu Jie set fires in universities and colleges. They launched a five-pronged attack,妄想给共产党以“致命打击”。(妄想 - Vainly hoped) (hoped to give the Communist Party a "fatal blow.")
    There must be division of labor and steps. The first step was to use the mass airing of views to "骂倒一切" (ma dao yi qie - berate and overthrow everything), negate the great achievements of the socialist revolution and socialist construction. Anyone who said that "achievements are fundamental and shortcomings are secondary" would be labeled with a "dogmatist" hat. In a situation where they were only allowed to talk about shortcomings and not allowed to talk about achievements, they顛倒是非的乱骂一通(dian dao shi fei de luan ma yi tong - randomly cursed and berated by reversing right and wrong) , saying that the Five-Year Plan had been ruined, the unified purchase and sale system had been messed up, the people's lives were too hard, politics was not democratic enough, and the Party could not lead science, and so on.
    After they described the work led by the Party as pitch black, the second step was to "搬石头(ban shi tou - move a rock), "挂帅印(gua shuai yin - assume command)," and make the comrades who were leading work "下台(xia tai - step down)," that is, to say "you are no good" and only "let me come." Their final common goal was to replace the Party's leading position.
    The basic characteristic of the Zhang-Luo alliance's criminal activities is to use two-faced tactics anytime and anywhere, with one set of words and deeds in front of people and another set behind their backs. In a socialist country, it is not possible to openly oppose socialism, so they have to do things that undermine the cause of socialism under the smoke screen of "loving socialism," and they have to carry out anti-Party activities under the slogan of supporting the Communist Party. They are using legal organizations to carry out illegal activities. Even after the anti-rightist struggle began, they still wanted to use the old methods to deceive people in order to muddle through. When Zhang Bojun began his self-criticism, he said in his article "I Made Serious Mistakes in Politics" that he was "used by the rightists," as if he, the head of the rightists, was not a rightist. Luo Longji said in his "self-criticism": "Even if my bones are burned to ashes, you won't find any attempt to oppose the Party or oppose socialism," and he swore an oath: "If it is found, I am willing to be punished by the national law and the alliance's regulations." He also said that his problem was different from Zhang Bojun's, that he was "convinced in his heart but not in his mouth," so he said many wrong things; Zhang Bojun was "convinced in his mouth but not in his heart." These nonsense words, although they cannot deceive anyone, do reveal a bit of truth, that is, they are both typical two-faced people who do not mean what they say.
    (3) The Complete Bankruptcy of the Zhang-Luo Alliance
    Just as the Zhang-Luo alliance, blinded by their interests, and other right-wing elements launched a frenzied attack on the Party that reached its climax, the people of the whole country could no longer bear it. Workers, peasants, and progressive intellectuals rose up to speak out. The anti-rightist struggle in all regions, all organs and enterprises, all democratic parties, all academic and cultural groups, and educational institutions across the country unfolded widely with the momentum of overwhelming the mountains and overturning the seas. Because the broad masses of the people realized that this was a political struggle and ideological struggle between the two lines of the socialist road and the capitalist road, a struggle related to the life and death of the country.
    The criminal activities of the bourgeois right-wing elements that violated the interests of the people and undermined the cause of socialism, according to the nature of the problem, have obviously exceeded the scope of contradictions among the people and are a kind of antagonistic contradiction. However, up to today, the people are still lenient towards them. Premier Zhou has clearly pointed out in his government work report: "We hope that through the promotion of external forces, the experience of life, and their own awakening, the right-wing elements can repent and accept transformation. The door of socialist transformation is open to them." If Zhang, Luo, and other bourgeois right-wing elements attempt to use the government's lenient policy, adhere to their erroneous positions, refuse to bow their heads and admit their guilt, sincerely repent, want to play two-faced tactics again, avoid the important and dwell on the trivial, refuse to thoroughly explain all their erroneous words and deeds to the people, and attempt to muddle through, then they will be severing themselves from the people.

    章罗联盟反动阴谋的剖视
　　朱学范
    在反右派斗争中，经各方面的揭发，发现章罗联盟反党活动特别恶劣。根据我自己学习和参加斗争的体会，写一些个人的看法。
    章伯钧和罗隆基等右派分子，利用中国共产党整风的机会，在全国掀起对党疯狂进攻的浪潮。章、罗反党联盟，并不是在党整风时期才形成，而是早在去年就秘密结合起来了。为什么章、罗过去在民主同盟内部为了夺取领导权，一向勾心斗角、互不相让，而到了去年却会彼此让步，勾结起来结成联盟呢？
    除了他们有共同的一贯反共的思想基础而外，还因为他们错估了最近一年来国内外形势的变化，他们误认为形势发展得对共产党大大不利了。于是他们尾巴翘起来了。他们企图在中国也制造一次类似匈牙利的叛乱事件，然后由他们出来“收拾残局”。为了共谋大事，章伯钧和罗隆基互相结合起来，形成了反党联盟。他们这一反党联盟，究竟想搞些什么勾当呢？
　  （一）章罗联盟的反动政治纲领他们要改变我国社会主义的道路
    社会主义是中国人民长期革命斗争的共同理想，而在中国共产党的领导下已变成了活生生的现实。它使贫穷、落后、半封建、半殖民地的旧中国，变为独立、富强、自由、民主、幸福的新中国。走社会主义道路，是中国历史发展的必然规律，不是任何少数政治野心分子所能改变其进程的。
    资产阶级右派分子和人民的想法不一样，他们认为社会主义并不怎样美好，但是又不敢在人民面前公开诋毁社会主义不好。章伯钧在“我爱社会主义”言不由衷的幌子下，用晦涩的、模棱两可的字眼紧接着说出他的心里话：“我也爱民主”。民主自然人人爱，问题是爱何等样的民主，爱资产阶级的民主，还是爱社会主义的民主？章、罗爱的是什么样的民主呢？他们自己已经说的很清楚。章伯钧说：“美国政治民主，经济不民主；苏联经济民主，政治不民主”。罗隆基唱的也是同一个调子：“资产阶级民主虽有缺点，但也还有他的优点；无产阶级专政固然也有优点，但总觉得缺乏一点什么东西”。章伯钧、罗隆基就是妄想要在社会主义的经济基础上来建立资本主义的上层建筑。既然社会主义不合乎他们的理想，社会主义和资产阶级民主又不可能结合成为一个政治上的混血儿，结论就只能是消灭社会主义，让资本主义复辟。
        他们要取消人民民主专政制度
    为什么章伯钧这样爱好资本主义民主呢？他在农工民主党中央委员会传达毛主席十大方针时所说的话中，已答复了这个问题。他说：现在许多人说资本主义不好，事实上资本主义也还有活力。为什么还有活力？就因为有多党制，有民主制度，有众议院和参议院，有在朝党和在野党。资本主义国家的办法是：你不行，我来；我不行，你来。在朝的骂在野的，在野的骂在朝的，这就是“活力”。我国是以工人阶级为领导、工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政，不是资本主义国家的二院的议院制，不是各党轮流执政，资产阶级右派分子就认为社会主义国家的政治制度不民主，或者说，不够民主。无怪乎章伯钧在统战部召开的座谈会上竟狂妄地提出成立“政治设计院”的反动主张来了。
    章伯钧费尽心机想在国家最高权力机关——人民代表大会上面，设立一个太上机构“政治设计院”，想使民主党派有权否决共产党通过人民代表大会提出的国家政策方针，这种苦心设计实际上就是要推翻我国宪法所规定的人民代表大会的基本政治制度。
    资产阶级右派分子为什么这样处心积虑地要取消人民民主专政呢？这是容易理解的，因为在人民民主专政政权下，只有人民才能充分享受广泛的民主权利，而对于社会主义敌人则是剥夺他们的政治权利，实行专政的。右派分子认为这就不够民主，使民主受了“损害”。于是他们以民主“保卫者”的姿态出现，要“使民主得到健全发展”。
    他们要夺取中国共产党的领导权
    右派分子知道，要取消人民民主专政，就必须取消中国共产党的领导，因为中国共产党的领导，是实现人民民主专政，建设社会主义的基本保证。
      自从中国共产党去年提出各民主党派“长期共存、互相监督”的方针以后，资产阶级右派分子荒谬绝伦地以为可以抬高民主党派的身价，与领导党分庭抗礼了。他们利令智昏地忘记了人民民主专政是在工人阶级领导下的阶级联盟，更忘记了代表各阶级利益的政党必须接受中国共产党的领导是人民民主专政的一个基本条件。章伯钧说：“民主党派进步了，不要统战部过多的帮助。今天民主党派是政治自由、组织独立了，在工作上就不须依靠共产党。”据他说，“这是合乎时代发展规律的”。他在今年4月民盟全国工作会议上，竟然狂妄到说出“周公辅成王”这种极端反动的话来，他把民主党派比做成王，把中国共产党比做周公，他说现在成王已经长大，如果不再让他独立自主，恩人就会变成仇人。
    客观的时代发展规律是：不论过去走第三条路线的民主同盟也好，不论过去“三分反共，七分反蒋”的农工民主党也好，最后都必须接受共产党的领导。任何民主党派，如果要脱离中国共产党的领导，那就必然越出社会主义的轨道，因而为全国人民所唾弃。
    他们反对马列主义的思想领导
    资产阶级右派分子在政治上既然反对领导全国人民进行社会主义建设的中国共产党，在思想上就必然不愿接受马列主义的科学理论，因为中国共产党是以马列主义武装起来的工人阶级的政党，它运用了马列主义理论和中国的具体情况相结合，胜利地结束了新民主主义革命和基本上完成了社会主义革命。
    当中国共产党提出“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针后，右派分子就在反对“教条主义”的名义下，对马列主义进行无耻歪曲和放肆攻击。章伯钧把马列主义说得一钱不值，比中国几千年前的封建文化还不如，他在中共中央号召学习马列主义时说：“我认为诗经、论语还有用，马列主义只有那么几条，我就没有兴趣，不值一学”。他不想学马列主义想搞什么呢？他说想搞一套“新人文主义”，打算在新中国搞一套“文艺复兴”的把戏。他一再声言，要争取“精神自由”，并特别强调“独立思考”。罗隆基是向来讨厌思想改造的，他说：“我不学马列主义，也能写出马列主义的文章来”。在他看来，“正派的”知识分子，就是保留着资产阶级思想的人。他甚至在这个问题上恶意挑拨知识分子和共产党的关系，他说，知识分子和党的距离，是思想改造运动搞出来的。他在政协谈到知识分子问题时，不是从正面帮助知识分子，加强思想改造，而是迎合知识分子的落后意识，说什么要“礼贤下士”，“三顾茅庐”。
    资产阶级右派分子所以要反对学习马列主义，反对思想改造运动，只是为了要为资本主义复辟，保留资本主义最后一块思想阵地而已。
    他们反对无产阶级国际主义
    章罗联盟既然反对中国共产党，反对马克思列宁主义，那末在他们的对外关系上，就必然要走上反对苏联的道路。
    章伯钧的反苏思想是由来已久的，一年来更为露骨。他说苏联除了重工业外，什么也不行，同时认为资本主义制度还有前途，因此世界究竟到那里去？他认为还值得研究。罗隆基一贯仇视苏联，走亲美路线，在全国即将解放的前夕，他还提出协和外交政策，不赞成向苏联一边倒。解放后，还想反苏亲美。特别是波匈事件发生后，与章伯钧的反苏论调更为投机了。
    反对社会主义、反对人民民主专政、反对共产党的领导、反对马列主义的思想领导和反对无产阶级国际主义，这就是章罗联盟极端反动的政治纲领，在这个反动政治纲领下，他们结成了联盟，周密地有计划有步骤地从去年开始就展开阴谋活动。
    （二）章罗联盟向党进攻的策略方针控制和发展组织，扩张政治资本
    章罗联盟为了实现反党、反社会主义的罪恶阴谋，早就积极准备组织力量，一旦时机成熟，便全面发动向党进攻。
    章伯钧与罗隆基结成联盟后，首先是想篡夺民盟中央的领导机构，企图使沈钧儒主席退居为名誉主席。由章伯钧当主席，罗隆基当常务副主席。在人事安排上则排挤进步分子拉拢右派分子，他们把曾昭抡安插在文教委员会，把费孝通安放在文教部，以便在文教界兴风作浪。同时，章伯钧在农工民主党内加强右派领导力量。不顾别人的反对，坚持要黄琪翔任农工民主党的副主席，把李伯球调到北京来担任农工民主党北京市的主任委员。这样在农工民主党内便组成了以章伯钧为首的章、黄、李等右派分子领导集团。
    从章罗联盟形成时候起，他们就叫嚷着民主党派要大发展，为实现他们所向往着的资本主义找政治资本。章伯钧说：“组织成员越多，力量越大，就越能卖钱。”要民主党派发展到一、二百万成员，这样就可以和共产党分庭抗礼了。
    章罗联盟是怎样来贯彻执行他们大发展方针的呢？方式方法是多种多样的。很多是非常恶劣的。有“抓名牌”、“撒大网”、“向落后开门”等等。他们为了拉拢一些有代表性的人物，以抬高民主党派身价，甚至不惜工本，用登门拜访、请客吃饭等各种手段，答应可以不写自传、不参加任何会议为条件。为了发展组织，可以不问发展对象的政治面貌如何，还到处物色对共产党不满的人，他们采取来者不拒，多多益善的“路线”。在农工民主党内，章伯钧甚至收罗了一批被劳改和管制过的人来扩大他们的“阵容”。
    夺取报刊作为反党活动的工具
    章罗联盟在组织上的大发展的同时，也就是在思想战线上扩大宣传鼓动的时候，他们想利用报纸来为他们卑鄙的政治目的服务。在储安平任光明日报总编辑的两个月里，就篡改了这一各民主党派的机关报的政治方向。章伯钧在储安平到光明日报担任总编辑后，就计划对该报社进行人事改组。章伯钧又同意罗隆基介绍右派“理论家”陈新桂到光明日报社来当总编辑，而由储安平任报社副社长。罗隆基也同意章伯钧的主张，为光明日报组织一个“顾问团”，由罗隆基、费孝通、钱伟长等人组成，在报社内有意识的排挤党团员，加强右派分子的力量，要把民主党派的机关报，改变成为章罗联盟的机关报。　　章罗联盟通过储安平控制光明日报外，还由罗隆基通过浦熙修、徐铸成的关系控制了上海文汇报。浦熙修经常向罗隆基请示，在罗隆基出国期间则向章伯钧请示。
    章罗联盟不但夺取报纸，而且对刊物也不放松，他们还夺取了民盟北京市委筹备的“争鸣”月刊，并将它改为政治性刊物，以此配合光明和文汇两张报纸，作为章罗联盟反党、反人民、反社会主义的宣传工具。
    到处点火，向党进攻
    章罗联盟向党进攻先从挑拨文教界、科学技术人员与党的关系开始，他们诬蔑党不能领导知识分子，不能领导科学技术。当我国正在实现社会主义工业化的进程中，高级知识分子、科技人员将发挥重要作用，而章罗却从中挑拨他们与党的关系。特别是利用少数比较落后的，对过去几次运动存在着不满情绪的，或是在生活待遇上有意见的知识分子，章罗联盟故意替这些人呼冤叫屈，以博得这些人的好感，来扩大反党联盟的组织和政治影响，作为向党进攻的政治资本。
    整风开始不久，他们既不向沈钧儒主席请示报告，也不与其余两位副主席商量，更没有经过常委会决定，就用民盟中央名义设立了“科学规划”、“高等学校党委制”、“长期共存、互相监督”、“有职无权”四个工作组，这些工作组都由民盟的高级知识分子负责召集座谈和起草纲领。章罗联盟的核心之一陶大镛，提出“民主办校”的最高纲领和最低纲领，企图根本取消学校党委制。章罗联盟的核心分子费孝通、曾昭抡和钱伟长，提出反对党领导科学的纲领，否定社会主义教育路线，挑拨党与科学家的关系。
    6月6日，章伯钧在政协文化俱乐部召集曾昭抡、钱伟长、费孝通、陶大镛、吴景超、黄药眠等六教授的紧急会议，可说是他们反党活动达到登峰造极的地步了。他们对于当前形势作了一个极端荒谬的估计。他们说，中国知识分子闹事是有传统的，从汉朝的太学生到“五四”，都是学生闹起来的。章伯钧在会上说：“大学生这样闹下去，说不定会发生匈牙利那样事件。如果学生跑上街去，与市民搞在一起，事情就不好办了”。他们认为共产党已“失去人心”，以为共产党“能放不能收，要收就得三百万军队，但人心是失去了”。因此，他们认为到了可以向党讲话的时候了，他们想以帮助党收拾残局来进行政治讹诈。右派分子昏头昏脑妄想动摇我国的人民民主政权，真如蚍蜉撼大树，未免太自不量力了。
    章罗联盟向党发动进攻，采取了“突破一点，推动全面”的方法。北京就是他们进攻的重点之一。
    分头并进，策动各地右派同时向党进攻
    民盟中央在章罗联盟操纵下向党展开攻势的同时，民盟地方组织中的右派分子也从各地分头向党进攻起来。罗隆基小集团在民盟地方组织控制有很多据点，如陈仁炳和彭文应在上海，潘大逵在西南，马哲民在湖北，杜迈之在湖南，姜震中在浙江，王文光在太原，陈仰之在青岛，这时就都起来向党展开了疯狂的进攻。
    在章罗联盟直接控制下的光明日报和文汇报，加派记者到各大城市去点火，而且深入到基层，深入到县，深入到中小学校，打乱中共整风步骤，挑拨党群关系，造成社会混乱。
    章罗联盟向党进攻是有分工的，上海右派分子就是按照“说话不离本行”的方法进行活动的。如陈仁炳和彭文应抓民盟市委和文艺戏剧界，王造时和杨兆龙进攻司法工作，陆诒抓新闻工作，孙大雨和许杰在高等学校中放火。他们发动五路进攻，妄想给共产党以“致命打击”。
    有分工，还要有步骤。第一步是利用大鸣大放，“骂倒一切”，否定社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大成绩，谁要是说“成绩是基本的，缺点是次要的，就给他带上一顶‘教条主义’大帽子”。在只准说缺点，不准说成绩的情况下，就颠倒是非的乱骂一通，说什么五年计划搞坏啦，统购统销搞糟啦，人民生活太苦啦，政治不够民主啦，党不能领导科学啦，如此等等。
    他们把党领导的工作说成一团漆黑以后，第二步就是要“搬石头”，“挂帅印”，要做领导工作的党员同志“下台”，就是说“你不行”，只有“让我来”。他们最后的共同目标，是要取党的领导地位而代之。
    章罗联盟的罪恶活动的基本特点，是随时随地使用两面手法，当面是一套，背后又一套。在社会主义国家里，要公开反对社会主义是不行的，他们只好在“爱社会主义”的烟幕下，干破坏社会主义事业的勾当，他们只好在拥护共产党的口号下，进行反对共产党的活动。他们是利用合法组织，进行非法活动。即使是在反右派斗争开始以后，他们还想用老办法来迷惑人，以图蒙混过关。章伯钧在开始检查时，在“我在政治上犯了严重的错误”一文中，说他是“为右派分子所利用”，好像他这右派分子的头子还不是右派分子。罗隆基在他“检讨”时说：“把我的骨头烧成灰，也找不出反党，反社会主义的企图”，而且发誓赌咒说：“如果查出，愿受国法和盟章制裁”。他还说，他的问题和章伯钧的不一样，他是“心服口不服”，因而说错了很多话；章伯钧是“口服心不服”。这些胡言乱语，虽然欺骗不了任何人，但却也透露出一点真实，就是他们都是心口不一的两面派的典型。
    （三）章罗联盟的彻底破产
    正当章罗联盟利令智昏地和其他右派分子一同向党发动猖狂进攻达到高潮的时候，全国人民再也忍耐不下去了，工人、农民、进步知识分子纷纷起来说话了，在全国各个地区、各机关企业、各民主党派、各学术文化团体和教育机关中的反右派斗争，以排山倒海之势广泛展开了。因为广大人民认识到这是社会主义道路和资本主义道路两条路线的政治斗争和思想斗争，是关系到国家生死存亡的斗争。
    资产阶级右派分子进行违反人民利益、破坏社会主义事业的罪恶活动，按照问题的性质来说，显然已超出了人民内部矛盾的范围，是一种对抗性的矛盾，但是到今天为止，人民对他们还是宽大的。周总理在政府工作报告中已明确指出：“我们希望，经过外力的推动、生活的体验和自己的觉悟，右派分子能够憣然悔悟，接受改造。社会主义改造的大门对他们是开着的”。如果章、罗之流及其他资产阶级右派分子，企图利用政府的宽大政策，坚持自己的错误立场，不肯低头认罪，诚心悔改，再想玩弄一下两面派手法，避重就轻，不肯彻底向人民交代一切错误言行，企图蒙混“过关”，那就是自绝于人民。
