Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th. The Guangdong Provincial Organization of the China Democratic League recently exposed how Zhong Ping, a rightist backbone element and executor of the Zhang-Luo Alliance's conspiracy, used the Guangdong Provincial Organization of the China Democratic League to engage in anti-Communist Party and anti-socialist activities.

According to the exposure, Zhong Ping, in his capacity as Secretary-General and Director of the Organization Department of the Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, ignited fires everywhere during the period of Great Blooming and Great Contending to attack the Party. After attending the National Work Conference of the China Democratic League in April this year and returning to Guangzhou, he immediately convened a meeting to convey the anti-Party and anti-socialist program of the Zhang-Luo Alliance. Zhong Ping printed and distributed Zhang Bojun's distortion of Chairman Mao's talk on the school Party committee system to the grassroots level, and instructed his henchmen to clamor for the abolition of the Party committee system in universities. In addition to instructing the China Democratic League branches in Guangzhou's universities to specifically instigate dissatisfied people to attack the Party's leadership, Zhong Ping also prepared to "open up the situation properly" in secondary schools. He put forward inflammatory slogans within the League, claiming that they should "greatly bloom and greatly contend, bloom and contend on a small scale, and bloom and contend even if they don't want to," and said that "the organization can guarantee and support."

According to the exposure, Zhong Ping's manipulation of local organizations of the China Democratic League to carry out anti-Party and anti-socialist activities was all done according to his anti-Party clique's so-called method of "combining openness and secrecy." On the one hand, he openly used the name of the Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League to instruct lower-level organizations to "bloom and contend even if they don't want to"; on the other hand, he secretly directed his backbone elements, confidants, and henchmen to ignite fires everywhere. Zhong Ping secretly wrote a letter to his confidant, Li Shiqiang, Director of the Organization Department of the Zhanjiang Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, instructing him to collect "materials" against the Communist Party in local primary and secondary schools. Li then held fifteen consecutive forums in Zhanjiang to collect "materials," and according to the outline given to him by Zhong Ping, compiled the materials into a booklet and sent it to Zhong Ping. Zhong Ping also summoned Li Youjie, the leader of the Jiangmen Municipal Preparatory Committee of the China Democratic League and a backbone element of his anti-Party clique, gave him face-to-face instructions on how to attack the Party, and repeatedly encouraged Li, telling him "not to fall behind the situation."

Zhong Ping also actively implemented Zhang Bojun's policy of "great development." He proposed a plan to increase the number of League members in Guangdong from 1,000 last year to 4,000 this year.

According to the exposure, Zhong Ping organized an anti-Party clique as early as 1950, plotting to seize the leadership of the Guangdong Provincial Organization of the China Democratic League. His clique not only had an organization, a program, and a regular meeting system, but also put forward slogans such as "combining legality and illegality," and constantly attacked leading Party cadres and progressive forces within the League. After this anti-Party clique was initially discovered in 1953, Zhong Ping changed his past strategy of "personally going to the front line and launching a full-scale attack" to "entering invisibly and retreating invisibly" and "retreating in order to advance," and changed the way of holding meetings to using single-line contact more often in order to cover up. At the same time, he organized in the China Democratic League branches in South China Normal College, South China Agricultural College and other universities, as well as in Foshan, Jiangmen, Zhanjiang, Shantou, Shaoguan, Haikang and other counties and cities, trying to support right-wing elements who held leadership positions, or placing his own confidants and henchmen in leadership positions, in order to cultivate forces to seize the China Democratic League organization in an all-round way. During the re-election of the Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League last year, Zhong Ping purposefully nominated right-wing element Lin Kongxiang and Lü Yanhua and Zhu Jingtao, who could be used by him, as members of the Provincial Committee. Now these people have become vanguards who are doing their best to attack the Party.

    粉碎“公开与秘密相结合”的反党手法
    章罗联盟广东爪牙钟平现形
    据新华社广州16日电  民盟广东省组织最近揭露了章罗联盟阴谋的执行者、右派骨干分子钟平利用民盟广东省组织进行的反对共产党反对社会主义的活动。
    据揭露，钟平利用他民盟省委秘书长兼组织部长的职位在大鸣大放期间到处点火向党进攻。今年4月他参加民盟全国工作会议回广州后，就马上召开会议传达章罗联盟的反党反社会主义纲领。钟平把章伯钧歪曲毛主席关于学校党委制问题的谈话印发到基层去，并布置他的爪牙一齐叫嚣取消高等学校党委制。除了布置广州各高等学校民盟支部专门煽动对党不满的人攻击党的领导外，钟平还准备在中等学校“好好去打开局面”。他在盟内提出煽动性的口号，声称要“大放大鸣、小放大鸣、不放也大鸣”，并说“组织可以保证、撑腰”。
    据揭露，钟平操纵民盟地方组织进行反党反社会主义的勾当，都是按他的反党集团所谓“公开与秘密相结合”的方法进行的。一方面，他公开用民盟省委名义布置下层组织“不放也大鸣”；另方面则暗中指挥他的骨干、亲信及爪牙到处点火。钟平曾秘密写信布置他的亲信、民盟湛江市委组织部长李始强，在当地中小学搜集“材料”反对共产党。李就在湛江连续召开了十五次座谈会收集“材料”，并按钟平给他的提纲将材料整理成一本小册子，寄交钟平。钟平还曾召见他的反党集团骨干、民盟江门市筹委会主任委员李有杰，面授向党进攻的机宜，并且要李“不要落后于形势”，一再给李有杰打气。
    钟平还积极执行了章伯钧“大发展”的方针。他提出广东盟员要由去年的一千名发展到今年四千名的计划。
    据揭露，钟平在1950年就组织反党集团阴谋夺取民盟广东省组织的领导权。他的集团不仅有组织、有纲领、有定期会议制度，还提出了“合法与非法相结合”等口号，不断对党员领导干部和盟内进步力量加以打击。1953年，这个反党集团被初步发现后，钟平便把过去“亲自上火线，全面进攻”的策略，改变为“进得无形、退得无形”“以退为进”，并把开会活动方式变为多用单线联系，以掩人耳目。同时他在华南师范学院、华南农学院等高等学校民盟支部以及佛山、江门、湛江、汕头、韶关、海康等县市组织，设法支持掌握领导权的右派分子，或把自己的亲信和爪牙安插到领导位置上，以培植势力全面夺取民盟组织。在去年民盟省委改选时，钟平别有用心地提出右派分子林孔湘和可为他利用的吕燕华、朱静涛等人为省委委员。现在这些人都已成为竭力向党进攻的急先锋。
