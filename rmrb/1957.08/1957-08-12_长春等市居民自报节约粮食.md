Xinhua News Agency, 11th: Residents of cities such as Changchun, Jinan, Lanzhou, and Nanchang are actively saving grain.

    In Changchun City, nearly 80% of citizens have voluntarily reported grain savings. According to statistics, on average, each person saves 7.9 liang (approximately 395 grams) per month within the original fixed grain supply standard, totaling 457,000 jin (approximately 228,500 kilograms) of grain saved citywide each month. The grain supply situation in the city is currently normal.

    In Lanzhou City, the average monthly supply per person has decreased by more than two jin (approximately 1 kilogram) compared to half a year ago. The total supply in the city in June decreased by 7% compared to April. In May and June, the grain departments recovered more than 600,000 jin (approximately 300,000 kilograms) of surplus grain.

    In Nanchang City, in July, residents of factories, government offices, and street communities voluntarily returned more than 170,000 jin (approximately 85,000 kilograms) of grain they had saved to the state. The city's grain supply volume this month also decreased compared to June.

    Since the beginning of this year, provincial-level government offices in Shandong Province and government organizations and street residents in Jinan City have saved a total of 3.4 million jin (approximately 1.7 million kilograms) of grain, which has been successively returned to the grain departments.

    Since the beginning of this year, relevant departments in these cities have promoted the significance of saving grain to collective mess halls and residents, and some have rectified grain supply work. After the Changchun City Grain Bureau organized a large number of cadres to conduct publicity and education on saving grain in April and May, many street residents have formulated grain-saving covenants and family grain consumption plans, and some grain-saving cooking methods have emerged among government offices and residents. Lanzhou City has rectified the grain supply work of more than 2,000 collective mess halls in government offices, factories, mines, and schools. Many government offices no longer complain that the grain supply standards are insufficient, and some even have surplus grain; the phenomenon of grain waste caused by poor mess hall management is rarely seen.

    长春等市居民自报节约粮食
    新华社11日讯　长春、济南、兰州、南昌等城市居民积极节约粮食。
    长春市已有将近80％的市民自报节约粮食。据统计，平均每月每人在原定粮食供应标准内节约七两九，全市每月共可节约粮食四十五万七千斤。现在全市粮食供应情况正常。
    兰州市最近几个月以来，平均每人每月供应量比半年前减少两斤多。六月份全市总供应量比四月份减少7％。五、六两个月内，粮食部门收回余粮六十多万斤。
    南昌市各工厂、机关和街道居民7月份主动向国家缴回节约的粮食十七万多斤。这个月全市粮食供应量也比6月份有所下降。
    山东省省级机关和济南市各机关团体、街道居民，今年上半年共节约了粮食三百四十万斤，已陆续交回粮食部门。
    今年以来，这些城市的有关部门向集体伙食单位和居民宣传了节约粮食的意义，有的整顿了粮食供应工作。长春市粮食局在四、五月间组织大批干部进行节约粮食的宣传教育以后，已有很多街道居民订出节约粮食公约和家庭用粮计划，机关和居民中还出现了一些省粮的做饭方法。兰州市整顿了两千多个机关、厂矿和学校等集体伙食单位的粮食供应工作。许多机关不再喊叫粮食供应标准不够了，有的还有粮食剩余，因伙食管理不善而造成粮食浪费的现象已很少看见。
