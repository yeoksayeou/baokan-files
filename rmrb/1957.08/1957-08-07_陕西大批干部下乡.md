Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an – The socialist propaganda and education movement in Shaanxi Province has been gradually unfolding in the countryside. Leadership departments in various regions are drawing upon a group of cadres to deepen leadership and strengthen this work.

Recently, Lintong County dispatched eighty cadres, who have already been giving reports to members of various agricultural cooperatives. Hu County has gathered more than seven hundred cadres, providing them with training and preparing to send them deep into the countryside to conduct propaganda. The Shangluo Special District will also universally train propaganda cadres.

The counties of Weinan and Xingping will dispatch 190 county-level Party member leading cadres, who will not only give reports to farmers but also assist grassroots Party organizations in training cadres and organizing propaganda forces. The CCP Shangluo, Ankang, and Hanzhong District Committees have decided that responsible cadres will lead work teams deep into key townships and cooperatives, taking the first step to summarize experience in order to guide the movement.
