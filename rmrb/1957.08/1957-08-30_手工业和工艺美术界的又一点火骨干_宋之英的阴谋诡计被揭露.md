Another Arsonist in the Handicraft and Arts & Crafts Circles

　　Song Zhiying's Conspiratorial Tricks Exposed

　　(Our dispatch) Song Zhiying, another key figure ignited by Zhang Bojun in the handicraft and arts & crafts circles, has been exposed by the staff of the Central Handicraft Administration and the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Handicraft Cooperative.

　　Song Zhiying is the section chief of the Arts & Crafts Bureau of the All-China Handicraft Cooperative and the chairman of the China Democratic Party Light Industry Branch (including the Ministry of Light Industry, the Central Handicraft Administration, and the Beijing Handicraft Cooperative). He is a bourgeois reactionary political ambitious.

　　As soon as the rectification began, Song Zhiying carried out Zhang Bojun's instructions and, under the guise of helping the Party with rectification, viciously slandered the Communist Party, saying: "The Communist Party is in a terrible state; it must be rectified, or it will be ruined." He divided the cadres in the office into "four categories": except for a very few, other Party members were either arrogant and self-important, thought of themselves as the best, or ideologically conservative, dogmatic, and morally corrupt, and detached from the masses. He compared the Communist Party to the feudal tyrant Qin Shi Huang, saying that "three households can destroy Qin, and an ant can collapse a dam." He openly proposed to participate in the joint meetings of the bureau and the cooperative in the capacity of a "democratic party" and arrogantly said: "Our organization (referring to Zhang Bojun) has said that you must reply; otherwise, we will report it to Chairman Mao."

　　Song Zhiying repeatedly accepted the instructions of Zhang Bojun, Li Boqiu, and Li Jiansheng to carry out malicious large-scale development in the handicraft and arts & crafts circles. Their development policy was "demand progress, strive for the middle ground, and face the backward" and "three不怕's" (i.e., not afraid of backwardness, not afraid of unemployment, not afraid of complex histories). Among the four China Democratic Party members he developed in other units, two were Kuomintang Central Statistics Bureau and Military Intelligence Bureau agents, one had an unclear political history, and one was a drug dealer who had not yet served his full sentence. In the early stages of the rectification, he went around visiting people and developing the organization. He said to some people who had been investigated during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries: "If you join our organization, they will not dare to rectify you during the rectification; you will have an organization to support you."

　　Since the beginning of the anti-Rightist struggle, many people who had been deceived and won over by him have come forward to expose his conspiracies and tricks. Under the rational struggle of the masses, although Song Zhiying has also confessed to some problems, his confessions are not profound enough. The masses are currently further exposing and criticizing his reactionary words and deeds.

### 手工业和工艺美术界的又一点火骨干　宋之英的阴谋诡计被揭露

　　手工业和工艺美术界的又一点火骨干
　　宋之英的阴谋诡计被揭露
    本报讯　章伯钧在手工业及工艺美术界点火的另一个骨干宋之英，已经被中央手工业管理局、全国手工业合作总社筹委会的职工揭发出来了。
    宋之英是总社工艺美术局科长、农工民主党轻工业支部（包括轻工业部、中央手工业管理局、北京市手工业合作总社）主任委员，是一个资产阶级反动政治野心家。
    整风刚刚开始，宋之英就执行章伯钧的指示，在帮助党整风的幌子下，对共产党进行恶毒的污蔑说：“共产党糟透了，不整不得了”。他把机关的党员分成“四类”：除极少数外，其他党员不是老子天下第一、骄傲自大，就是思想保守、教条主义和品质恶劣、脱离群众。他把共产党比喻为封建暴虐的秦始皇，说“三户可以亡秦，一蚁可以溃穴”他公开提出要以“民主党派”身份参加局、社联席会议，而且狂妄地说：“我们的组织（指章伯钧）说了，要你们答复，否则就反映给毛主席。”
    宋之英屡次接受章伯钧、李伯球和李健生的指示在手工业及工艺美术界进行恶性大发展。他们的发展方针是“要求进步、争取中间、面向落后”和“三不怕”（即不怕落后、不怕失业、不怕历史复杂）。他在其他单位发展的四名农工民主党党员中，就有两名是国民党中统、军统特务分子，一名政治历史不清，一名是徒刑未满的贩毒犯。整风初期，他到处串门奔走，发展组织。他对某些在肃反中被审查过的人说：“你参加我们的组织，他们在整风中就不敢整你，有组织给你撑腰”。
    反右派斗争开始以来，许多被他欺骗、拉拢过的人都纷纷揭发他的阴谋诡计。在群众的说理斗争下，宋之英虽然也交代了一些问题，但极不深刻，目前群众正在进一步揭发和批判他的反动言行。
