Are Modern Newspapers Not a Product of Class Struggle?
——Historically Refuting Wang Zhong's Fallacies
Si Mu

When I was in Beijing attending the National Propaganda Work Conference, I heard that Wang Zhong had raised the issue of the dual nature of newspapers, emphasizing the so-called "commodity nature" of newspapers. I already suspected that this news department director, who is a Party member, was peddling something of dubious quality. After arriving in Shanghai, I read his lengthy "Outline of Principles of Journalism," which ran to fifty or sixty thousand words, with great patience. I discovered that he was hanging the signboard of Marxism and historical materialism, but peddling nothing but thoroughly cheap bourgeois journalistic wares. Wang Zhong's central aim is to negate the Marxist-Leninist scientific viewpoint that newspapers are tools of class struggle, thereby negating the Party's leadership over the press and providing a theoretical basis for rightists to tamper with the political direction of the people's press. To deny that newspapers are tools of class struggle, Wang Zhong flaunted his clumsy skills learned from the history of bourgeois journalism, attempting to prove from history and the origins of newspapers that the press is not a product of class struggle, but a so-called "social product," its emergence and development stemming from so-called "social needs." Although he dares not deny that the proletarian press, from its inception, appeared as a tool of class struggle, he then asserts: "This cannot be said of the bourgeois press." Moreover, regarding the proletarian press as a tool of class struggle, judging from Wang Zhong's sarcastic remarks about the "iron face" of Party newspapers, and his ridicule of the guiding nature of socialist newspapers, he really believes that emphasizing newspapers as tools of class struggle will only make newspapers bad, "odious," and unwanted by readers. Leaving aside other things, judging only from the part of his speech that scares people about the origin of the press, his argument is ambiguous and sophistical. His boasting cannot scare people, nor can it save himself.

In this regard, we find at least two major fallacies in Wang Zhong's arguments.

First, he distorts history. He asserts that it cannot be said that bourgeois newspapers appeared from the beginning as tools of class struggle. What is the basis for this statement? Although I don't have many journalism books at hand, by simply flipping through Ge Gongzhen's "History of Chinese Journalism" and one or two books on the history of newspapers and periodicals written by bourgeois scholars, we find that historical facts cannot serve as evidence for Wang Zhong's "twisted logic," but rather as evidence for the Marxist-Leninist truth that newspapers are tools of class struggle. For example, take the newspapers of Venice and other Italian cities in the late Middle Ages and early modern times mentioned by Wang Zhong, which were a kind of bourgeois newspaper in its embryonic state. Wang Zhong believes that the emergence of "handwritten news" at that time was "because Venice was a commercial port with many ships coming and going, and people needed to know when ships would sail and where they were going," as if it stemmed from purely commercial needs and had nothing to do with class struggle. Elsewhere, he simply says that big merchants and aristocrats bought "handwritten news" for business or to increase their knowledge, still unrelated to class struggle. But is this the case? Anyone with a little historical knowledge knows that in the Italian city-states of that time, there were sharp class struggles between feudal lords and the emerging bourgeoisie, such as merchants and bankers, and between the upper echelons of the cities and the working masses. Moreover, there were constant conflicts between cities or city-groups for dominance in overseas commerce, so the political situation was very unstable. It was precisely under these circumstances that the ruling class of the time was very concerned about external events, paying attention to all major events in the world, and sparing no expense to buy news. According to G. WEILL's "The Growth of Newspapers" (translated by Song Shanliang, published by Commercial Press), the Italian printed newspapers of the 15th century that have survived did not publish things like ship schedules or purely commercial news, but news about Turkish wars and other matters closely related to the commercial interests of the emerging Italian bourgeoisie. Wang Zhong, I ask you, is this kind of "social need" not a need of class struggle? After Martin Luther advocated the Reformation, the class struggle surrounding the Reformation—the struggle to establish a new bourgeois church to confront the feudal Catholic Church—used newspapers as a weapon even more. To resist the Reformation, the Pope ordered journalists not to speak, even cutting off their hands, tongues, and even hanging them. Wang Zhong also mentioned this kind of persecution suffered by journalists at that time in his speech on the "Outline of Principles of Journalism," but only attributed it to the "vulgarity" and "troublemaking" of journalists, while avoiding mentioning that this was class struggle. In order to deny the class nature of the press, Wang Zhong does not hesitate to distort history in this way. The word "vulgar" is used on Wang Zhong, but it is just right.

Speaking of the early bourgeois newspapers in China, Ge Gongzhen's "History of Chinese Journalism" clearly tells us that the newspapers run by foreign missionaries or foreign businessmen were of course weapons of imperialist cultural aggression against the Chinese people, and the official newspapers and periodicals run by the Manchu Qing government, such as the "Official Bookstore Gazette" and the "Current Affairs Official Gazette," were also related to the reform movement and the progressive movement initiated by the upper echelons of scholar-officials at that time. Later, privately-run newspapers sprang up, becoming the main political weapon for Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao's Reformist-Royalist faction and Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary faction to win over people's hearts. The newspapers of the two factions once engaged in fierce pen battles. Anyone who has dabbled in modern Chinese history remembers this historical fact. Unless Wang Zhong dares to deny that Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao's reform movement and Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary movement were class struggles, the statement that Chinese bourgeois newspapers appeared at the beginning as weapons of class struggle is irrefutable. It is strange that when Wang Zhong's speech talked about the types of newspapers in the late Qing Dynasty, he only mentioned the "Current Affairs News" and "South China Daily," which "emphasized political opinions," in a very simple way, while he talked a lot about the "Dianshizhai Pictorial," "Game News," and "Xiaolin News," which published a lot of social news and prostitute news (of course, these newspapers also played a role in corroding and numbing the people for the ruling class, and therefore were also an ideological weapon of class struggle), talking with relish. From here, we can not only see where Wang Zhong's "interest" lies, but also show how Wang Zhong is ulteriorly motivated.

Second, another absurd point of Wang Zhong's is that he believes that newspapers appear and develop in periods when the rule is relatively consolidated and class struggle is not acute, so he concludes: "If it is said that class struggle only produces newspapers, I don't think it is completely in line with the facts." He lists so-called facts to prove that sharp class struggles such as slave riots, peasant wars, and even the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom uprising did not "produce newspapers." Wang Zhong thinks that this point is very powerful and very clever, but in fact it just exposes that he is either completely ignorant of class struggle or deliberately distorts it. Anyone with a little Marxist-Leninist common sense knows that class struggle is carried out in the form of military, political, economic, and ideological struggles, and the newspaper as a tool of class struggle mainly refers to the fact that it provides a powerful weapon in the ideological struggle. However, the class struggle in Wang Zhong's mind seems to be limited to political struggle, especially military struggle. Only when slaves armed themselves against slave owners and feudal landlords suppressed peasant uprisings can it be considered a sharp class struggle. Therefore, if such a class struggle does not "produce" newspapers, he believes that newspapers are not products and tools of class struggle. In fact, when modern newspapers have the material conditions for their emergence, whether class struggle is acute or缓和, newspapers are used as ideological weapons of class struggle. As pointed out above, in the late Qing Dynasty, class struggle was sharp enough, and the newspapers run by the Chinese themselves emerged and developed as ideological weapons of class struggle, in coordination with the political and armed struggles of the reformists and revolutionaries of the upper echelons of scholar-officials and the emerging bourgeoisie at that time. Wang Zhong, can you deny that the "Current Affairs News," "New Citizen Journal," "Subao," and "Min Bao" at that time were not "produced" by sharp class struggle? As for Wang Zhong's claim that the development of newspapers is rather in the period when the ruling class has stabilized and class struggle has eased, even if it is in line with the facts, it cannot be used to deny the truth that newspapers are tools of class struggle. Because, after the bourgeoisie has gone through fierce class struggle—the bourgeois revolution—to seize power, in order to consolidate their rule, they will use newspapers as an ideological weapon to carry out class struggle, to carry out propaganda and deception for their economic exploitation and political oppression, which is very natural. On the other hand, with the victory of the bourgeois revolution and the adoption of capitalist production methods, it also breeds the proletariat and proletarian consciousness, causing the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the proletarian newspaper appears clearly as an ideological weapon of class struggle. In this way, the press has developed vigorously. Therefore, this historical fact of the development of the Western press just proves that modern newspapers are inseparable from class struggle.

It should be further pointed out that it is precisely because Wang Zhong deliberately distorts the theory of class struggle that he further distorts Chairman Mao's speech on the correct handling of contradictions among the people at the Supreme State Conference, saying that now that class struggle in our country has basically ended, if newspapers "are still engaged in class struggle there every day," then it is "absurd," "which is contrary to the situation of our entire country." In fact, it is not others who are "absurd" and "contrary to the situation of the entire country," but Wang Zhong himself. Today, when the anti-Rightist struggle has unfolded fiercely, everyone sees that although the socialist revolution has basically achieved victory and the large-scale, rapid-fire mass class struggle has basically ended, class struggle has not ended; on the economic front, the struggle between the two roads of capitalism and socialism has been decided, but the struggle between the two roads on the political and ideological fronts is still unfolding. Facts have proved that the bourgeois rightists are launching a frenzied attack in this regard, and Wang Zhong, this bourgeois rightist, is the vanguard of attacking us on the ideological front. He attempts to steal beams and exchange pillars under the cover of the distorted theory that class struggle has basically ended and newspapers are no longer tools of class struggle, to disarm us and seize the position of socialist newspapers. Under such circumstances, today's socialist newspapers, "still engaged in class struggle there every day," vigorously carrying out special struggles, launching a powerful counterattack against the rightists, and overthrowing Wang Zhong and all other rightists, are not only not "absurd" and not "contrary to the situation of our entire country," but also absolutely necessary and indispensable.

In a word, the modern press is essentially a tool of class struggle, an ideological weapon, which emerges as a tool of class struggle and develops with the development of class struggle. Wang Zhong cited scriptures and exhausted all his efforts from the history of journalism, but he could not deny this historical fact and truth. Wang Zhong wants to establish his anti-Marxist-Leninist news theory system and tamper with the political direction of the people's press. His ambition is not small. It is a pity that his "twisted logic" of distorting historical facts can be broken with one blow. The ants shake the big tree, which is ridiculous and immeasurable. However, the stinky hat of the rightist has been worn from now on, no matter how slippery he is, he cannot slip away.

    现代的报纸不是阶级斗争的产物吗？
    ——从历史上驳斥王中的谬论
    思慕
    在北京参加全国宣传工作会议的时候，就听说王中提出报纸的两重性问题，强调报纸的所谓
  “商品性”，已经怀疑这位身为党员的新闻系主任贩卖的不知是什么货色。到了上海后，我以很大的耐心读完了他的洋洋五、六万言的“新闻学原理大纲”，更发现他挂的是马克思主义、历史唯物主义的招牌，贩卖的却是十足的、廉价的资产阶级新闻学的私货。王中的中心目的是要否定报纸是阶级斗争工具的马克思列宁主义科学论点，从而否定党对新闻事业的领导，提供右派分子以理论的基础，来篡改人民新闻事业的政治方向。为了否定报纸是阶级斗争的工具，王中卖弄他从资产阶级新闻学史上学来的蹩脚本领，企图从历史上、从报纸的起源上论证新闻事业不是阶级斗争的产物，而是所谓“社会产物”，它的产生、发展是出自所谓“社会需要”。他虽然不敢不承认，无产阶级报纸一产生就是作为一个阶级斗争的工具出现的，但他接着就断定：“资产阶级报纸还不能够这样说”。而且，就作为无产阶级的阶级斗争工具来说，从王中挖苦党报的“铁青的面孔”，嘲笑社会主义报纸的指导性等等“怪话”看来，他实在是认为强调报纸是阶级斗争工具的说法，只会把报纸办坏，办得“面目可憎”，读者不要看。不要说别的，单从他的讲话中拿来吓唬人的论新闻事业的起源那一部分看来，他的论证也是似是而非、强词夺理，他的卖弄吓唬不了人，也救不了他自己。
    在这方面，我们发现王中至少有两个重大的谬误。
    第一是歪曲史实。他断定，并不能够说资产阶级的报纸是一开头就作为阶级斗争工具出现，这话有什么根据呢？我手头虽然没有几本新闻学的书，但只要把戈公振的“中国报学史”和一两本资产阶级新闻学者写的报刊史翻一下，我们就发现，史实并不能为王中的“歪道理”作见证，而恰好是为报纸是阶级斗争工具的马列主义真理作见证。比方以王中所提及的中世纪末近代初头的威尼斯等意大利城市的报纸来说，那是一种在萌芽状态中的资产阶级报纸。王中认为那时的“手抄新闻”的产生，是“因为威尼斯是一个商港，船来来往往的很多，人要知道什么时间开船，什么时间往那里去”，像是出自纯粹的商业需要，而同阶级斗争丝毫无关。在另一地方，他也只是说，大商人、大贵族收买“手抄新闻”，为了做生意，或增加知识，仍与阶级斗争无关。但事实是不是这样呢？稍微有点历史常识的人都知道，在当时的意大利城市共和国中，封建主和商人、银行家等新兴资产阶级之间，城市上层分子和劳动群众之间进行着尖锐的阶级斗争；而各城市或城市集团之间，为了争夺海外商业上的霸权，也不断发生冲突，因而政治很不稳定。正是在这种情况之下，当时的统治阶级对于外间事件非常关切，注意世界上所有重大的事件，不惜以重价购买消息。据淮尔G．WEILL著：“日报期刊史”（宋善良译，商务印书馆出版）所载，留存下来的十五世纪的意大利印刷报纸所刊载的并不是船期表一类的东西，或单纯商业新闻，而是和意大利新兴资产阶级的商业利益有密切关系的土耳其战事一类的消息。请问王中，这样的“社会需要”，难道不是阶级斗争的需要吗？到了马丁·路德倡导宗教改革以后，环绕着宗教改革的阶级斗争——为了与封建的天主教教会对抗而建立新的资产阶级教会的斗争，更是以报纸作为武器。罗马教皇为了抵抗宗教改革，曾迫令新闻记者不发言论，甚至将他们割手拔舌，以至绞死。王中在他的“新闻学原理大纲”的讲话中虽也提及当时新闻记者所受的这种迫害，但只归咎于新闻记者的“下流”和“挑拨是非”，却讳言这是阶级斗争。为了否定新闻事业的阶级性，王中不惜这样歪曲史实，“下流”两个字用在王中身上，倒是恰如其份呢。
    说到中国初期的资产阶级报纸，戈公振的“中国报学史”就明白告诉我们，最初外国教士或外商办的报纸固然是帝国主义对中国人民进行文化侵略的武器，满清官办的报刊，如“官书局报”、
  “时务官报”等也是和当时的上层士大夫所发起的维新运动、改良运动有关。其后，民办报纸风起云涌，成为康梁的维新保皇派和孙中山所领导的革命派争取人心的主要政治武器，两派的报纸并曾经展开剧烈的笔战，稍为涉猎过中国近代史的人都记得这段史实。除非王中敢于否认康梁的维新运动和孙中山的革命运动是阶级斗争，中国资产阶级报纸一开头是以阶级斗争的武器出现的说法，是无可辩驳的。奇怪的是：王中的讲话谈到清末报纸的类型时，只极其简单地提到“着重政治言论”的“时务报”和“南华日报”，而对于大登社会新闻、妓女新闻的“点石斋画报”、“游戏报”、“笑林报”等（固然，这些报纸也是替统治阶级发挥腐蚀和麻醉人民的作用，因而也是一种阶级斗争的思想武器）却大谈特谈，讲得口沫横飞，津津有味。从这里不但可以看到王中的“趣味”所在，而且也显出王中是怎样别有用心。
    第二，王中的另一个荒谬的论点，就是认为报纸是在统治较巩固、阶级斗争不尖锐的时期出现和发展的，因而他得出的结论是：“如果说阶级斗争才斗出报纸来，我认为不完全符合事实。”他列举所谓事实来证明历史上像奴隶暴动、农民战争以至太平天国起义那样的尖锐的阶级斗争都没有“斗出报纸来”。王中自以为这个论点很有力，很俏皮，其实却正暴露出，他如果对于阶级斗争不是完全无知就是故意曲解。稍有马列主义常识的人都知道，阶级斗争是采取军事、政治、经济和思想斗争的形式来进行的，而报纸作为阶级斗争的工具来说，主要是指在思想斗争方面它提供了有力的武器。可是，王中心目中的阶级斗争像是只局限于政治斗争、特别是军事斗争，只有奴隶武装反抗奴隶主、封建地主镇压农民暴动，才算是尖锐的阶级斗争。因而，如果这样的阶级斗争
  “斗”不出报纸来，他就认为报纸不是阶级斗争的产物和工具。事实上，当现代的报纸具备了它产生的物质条件的时候，不论是阶级斗争尖锐或缓和，报纸都是被用为阶级斗争的思想武器而出现的。如上头所指出，满清末年，阶级斗争是够尖锐的，中国人自己办的报纸就是作为阶级斗争的思想武器，配合着当时上层士大夫、新兴资产阶级的改良派和革命派的政治斗争和武装斗争而涌现的、发展的。请问王中，你能够否认当时的“时务报”、“新民丛报”、“苏报”、“民报”等不是尖锐的阶级斗争“斗”出来的吗？至于王中所提出的报纸的发展毋宁是在统治阶级已经稳定、阶级斗争已经缓和时期的说法，就算是符合事实，也不能据以来否定报纸是阶级斗争工具的真理。因为，在资产阶级经过激烈的阶级斗争——资产阶级革命——取得政权以后，为了巩固他们的统治，便大量运用报纸这个思想武器来进行阶级斗争，来为他们的经济剥削和政治压迫进行宣传、欺骗，这是很自然的。另一方面，随着资产阶级革命的胜利，资本主义生产方式的采用，也孕育着无产阶级和无产阶级意识，引起了无产阶级和资产阶级之间的斗争，无产阶级的报纸便鲜明地作为阶级斗争的思想武器而出现。这样，新闻事业便蓬勃地发展起来。因此，西方新闻事业发展的这种史实，正好证明现代的报纸是同阶级斗争分不开的。
    更要指出，正是由于王中对阶级斗争的学说故意曲解，他又进一步把毛主席在最高国务会议扩大会议上关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的讲话加以歪曲，说什么现在我国阶级斗争既已基本结束，如果报纸“还在那里天天搞阶级斗争”“那就荒唐”，“这与我们整个国家的形势抵触了”。其实“荒唐”的、“与整个国家的形势抵触的”不是别人而正是王中自己。在反右派斗争已经猛烈地展开的今天，大家都看到，虽然社会主义革命已经基本上取得胜利，大规模的急风暴雨式的群众性阶级斗争基本上结束，但阶级斗争还没有结束；在经济战线上，资本主义和社会主义两条道路上的斗争虽是胜负已定，但在政治和思想战线上两条道路的斗争还在展开。事实证明，资产阶级右派分子正是在这方面发动了猖狂的进攻，而王中这个资产阶级右派分子就是在思想战线上向我们进攻的急先锋，他企图在阶级斗争已经基本结束，报纸不再是阶级斗争工具的歪曲理论的掩护之下，偷梁换柱，解除我们的武装，来夺取社会主义报纸的阵地。在这样的形势之下，今天的社会主义报纸，“还在那里天天搞阶级斗争”，大搞特搞，向右派分子展开有力的反击，把王中和其他一切的右派分子斗垮，不但不是“荒唐”，不是“与我们整个国家形势抵触”，而且是绝对必要，非此不可的。
    一句话，现代的新闻事业，本质上是阶级斗争的工具、思想武器，是作为阶级斗争的工具而出现，随着阶级斗争的发展而发展的。王中从新闻学史上引经据典，费了九牛二虎之力，也并不能否定这个史实和真理。王中要建立他的反马列主义的新闻理论系统，篡改人民新闻事业的政治方向，雄心可不小。遗憾的是，他的歪曲史实的“歪道理”，一攻即破，蚍蜉撼大树，可笑不自量，但右派分子的臭帽子却从此戴定了，任他怎样滑头滑脑，也还是滑不了的。
