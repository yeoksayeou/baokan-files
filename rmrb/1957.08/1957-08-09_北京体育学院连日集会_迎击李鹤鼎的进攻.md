    Beijing Institute of Physical Education Holds Rallies for Days
    To Counter Li Heding's Attack
    (Our Newspaper) Beijing—Teachers, students, and staff of the Beijing Institute of Physical Education have been holding rallies for days to criticize Li Heding.
    Li Heding is the chairman of the China Democratic League branch at the Beijing Institute of Physical Education and a professor at the institute. He has consistently distorted and slandered the correct sports policy of New China, conflating the essence of sports in the old and new China. He claimed that "the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission focuses too much on competitions but too little on mass sports, making it no different from the old sports," and that "the Sports Commission's emphasis on competitions is only for a few people, for the leaders to enjoy watching."
    Li Heding also stirred up trouble everywhere, repeatedly instigating Tong Qingyuan, a controlled element from the Peking University Physical Education Research Group, to boldly "speak out" and "air views." The "Extraordinary Committee" in the Institute of Physical Education was a reactionary organization, but Li said it had "good intentions." Li Heding also told Ma John, "I'll have a car pick you up and take you to the city to 'speak out' and 'air views.'" Ma John said, "I have already discussed my opinions with Comrade Rong Gaotang." Afterwards, Li Heding spread rumors, saying, "Ma John said that the General Administration of Sport of China is not effective and that an association of sports workers should be established." He used this to drive a wedge between the Party and democratic figures.
    Li Heding also sowed discord between the Party and the masses. He said, "There are two kinds of cadres in the institute: one is the good cadre who works diligently and conscientiously, but has no authority; the other is the cadre who is 'hypocritical, incompetent, passive, irresponsible, and given to boasting and flattery, only good at talking but not at doing work'" (referring to Party members, League members, and activists). Li Heding comes from a landlord family and studied in the United States for five years. After returning to China in 1951, he worked at Beijing Normal University and has been antagonistic to the Party ever since, slandering, distorting, and vilifying the leading cadres of the Party. He said to people, "Everyone shouts 'Long live Chairman Mao,' I can't shout it, I don't have that kind of feeling."

### 北京体育学院连日集会  迎击李鹤鼎的进攻

    北京体育学院连日集会
    迎击李鹤鼎的进攻
    本报讯　北京体育学院师生员工连日集会，批判李鹤鼎。
    李鹤鼎是民盟北京体育学院支部主任委员，体育学院教授，他一向歪曲和污蔑新中国正确的体育方针，把新旧中国体育事业的本质混为一谈，说什么“国家体委搞竞赛过多，但对全民体育却管的过少，和旧体育没啥不同”，“体委重视竞赛只是为了少数人，为了首长爱看”。
    李鹤鼎还到处点火，三番五次煽动北京大学体育教研组被管制分子童清园，大胆“鸣”“放”。体育学院中的“非常委员会”是一个反动组织，李却说它是“目的良好”。李鹤鼎还对马约翰说，“有汽车接你去城里‘鸣’‘放’”，马约翰说，“我有意见已和荣高棠同志谈了。”李鹤鼎事后却造谣说，“马约翰说体总不起作用，要成立体育工作者协会。”他借此挑拨党和民主人士的关系。
    李鹤鼎还挑拨党群关系。他说“学院中有两种干部，一种是踏踏实实地埋头苦干的好干部，但有职无权；另一种是“虚伪、无能、消极怠工、不负责任、吹牛拍马的干部，光会说漂亮话，不会做工作”（指党团员及积极分子）。李鹤鼎是地主家庭出身，留学美国五年。1951年回国后，在北京师范大学工作，就一直与党对立，谩骂、歪曲和丑化党的领导干部。他对人说，“大家都喊毛主席万岁，我喊不出来，我没有那样的感情。”
