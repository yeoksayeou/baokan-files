    A Pile of Broken Gloves...
    Huang Deshu
    One day, when I was talking with Xu Jietang, the director of the Yuci City Cotton Weaving Production Cooperative in Shanxi Province, he said with a smile, "As the saying goes, necessity is the mother of invention. This spring, we couldn't buy yarn to knit gloves, so everyone studied whether the gloves used in the factory could still be used. After some research, we found that most of the used gloves were only torn at the thumb and index finger, and they could be used after being mended. At the beginning of March, the cooperative sent people to the Jingwei Textile Machinery Manufacturing Factory to buy more than two thousand pairs of greasy broken gloves. After washing and processing, they were able to weave and mend seven hundred and twenty pairs of gloves." These gloves sold for three yuan and five jiao per dozen, which was two yuan cheaper than a dozen new gloves.
    Xu Jietang said that this pile of broken gloves has now become a treasure. In addition to weaving new gloves, they also extracted more than fifty jin of rotten cotton thread to wipe the machines in the factory. As he was speaking, a middle-aged man came in, carrying a small iron bucket. The man said to Director Xu, "Sell us two jin of oil, please?"
    I was puzzled: "Why is the cotton weaving production cooperative selling oil?"
    The director of the cooperative seemed to see what I was thinking, and while saying to the comrade who was buying oil:
  "Okay," he explained to me, "This is also a 'by-product' of the broken gloves. Originally, there was oil in the broken gloves bought from the machinery factory. Before washing, a lot of machine oil can be extracted. Experiments have proved that this kind of oil is very good for wiping weaving machines, sock knitting machines and other machines."
    This is how the members of this production cooperative are responding to the call for building the country through diligence and thrift: turning a pile of broken gloves into three useful things, and also increasing their income by more than one hundred yuan. (Attached picture)
    What is the difference between these gloves and those woven with new yarn?

    一堆破手套……
    黄德淑
    一天，我同山西省榆次市棉织生产合作社的主任许杰堂谈话的时候，他笑着说：“俗话说急生智。今年春天我们买不到线织手套，大家就研究工厂里用过的手套还能不能用。一研究才发现用过的手套多半只破了大拇指和食指，织补一下都是可以用的。3月初，社里便派人到经纬纺织机械制造厂买来了两千多付油腻腻的破手套，经过洗涤加工，能织补出手套七百二十付。”这种手套每打卖三元五角，比每一打新手套便宜两元。
    许杰堂说，这一大堆破手套现在都成了宝贝了，除了织新手套外，还拆出五十多斤烂棉线来给工厂擦机器用。正说着，进来了一个中年男子，手里提着一个小铁筒，那人对许主任说：“卖给我们两斤油吧？”
    我心里纳闷：“怎么棉织生产社还卖油？”
    社主任好像看出了我的心思，一面对买油的同志说：
  “行。”一面给我解释说：“这也是破手套的‘副产品’。原来是从机器厂买来的破手套里有油，在拆洗以前可以提炼出不少机油来。试验证明，用这种油擦洗织布机、织袜机和其它机器都很好。”
    这个生产社的社员们，就是这样响应勤俭建国的号召的：把一堆破手套变成三种有用的东西，并且还增加了一百多元的收入。（附图片）
    这跟用新线织出来的手套有什么两样？
