Xinhua News Agency, August 29th: Syria's new Army Chief of Staff, Bizri, on August 28th, criticized the United States' action of mobilizing the Sixth Fleet stationed in the Mediterranean to intimidate Syria. He said: "We will defend our country to the last man. I am sure that world opinion will not remain silent about such a military adventure by the United States."

According to Reuters, Bizri said in a statement to reporters at the Syrian Army Headquarters office: "The United States may defeat Syria in a war, but it cannot occupy this country because every Syrian will fight to the last drop of blood to drive out the invaders."

Bizri ridiculed reports that Syria has at least 6,500 Soviet technicians and military experts, saying, "Why not say 7,000?" He then added: "We do not have thousands of Soviet experts here, not hundreds of experts, not more than fifty, not even more than twenty."

On the same day, Bizri issued an order to resume military training for the People's Resistance Organization in Damascus. Five training centers will be established for military training. The "People's Resistance Organization" was announced by the Syrian Ministry of Defense on August 11th of last year. When announcing the establishment of this organization, the Ministry of Defense called on the people to receive military training in order to deal with the imperialist conspiracy to harm Arab countries. This organization is a reserve force for the regular army, under the jurisdiction of the army. It began military training after Egypt was invaded, and military training ceased after the invasion ended.

　　叙陆军参谋长严斥美国挑衅
　  命令人民抵抗组织恢复军训
    本报综合报道　据新华社29讯：叙利亚新任陆军参谋长比兹里8月28日抨击美国调动驻地中海的第六舰队对叙利亚进行恫吓的行动。他说：“我们要捍卫我们的国家直到最后一个人。我确信，世界舆论对于美国进行这样一种军事冒险是不会保持缄默的。”
    据路透社报道，比兹里在叙利亚陆军总部办公室对记者发表的谈话中说：“美国也许会在一场战争中击败叙利亚，但是它无法占领这个国家，因为每一个叙利亚人将会战斗到最后一滴血来把侵略者赶走。”
    比兹里嘲笑了关于叙利亚至少有六千五百名苏联技术人员和军事专家的消息，他说，“为什么不说成是有七千人呢？”他接着又说：“我们这里没有上千的苏联专家，没有上百的专家，没有五十几名，甚至连二十几名也没有。”
    同一天，比兹里发布命令，恢复在大马士革市的人民抵抗组织的军事训练。为了进行军事训练，将设立五个训练中心。“人民抵抗组织”是叙利亚国防部在去年8月11日宣布成立的。国防部在宣布成立这个组织的时候号召人民接受军事训练，以便对付帝国主义危害阿拉伯国家的阴谋。这个组织是正规军的后备队，受陆军管辖，在埃及受到侵略以后开始受军事训练，侵略事件结束以后军事训练就停止了。
