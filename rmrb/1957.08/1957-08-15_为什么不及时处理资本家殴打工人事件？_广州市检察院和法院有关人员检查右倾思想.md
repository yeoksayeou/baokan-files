Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 14th: Some cadres in the Guangzhou municipal political and legal departments recently examined and criticized right-leaning thought in handling cases of illegal capitalists beating progressive workers, and immediately reversed this right-leaning tendency.

On June 18, Feng Zhu, a private manager of the Guangzhou West District Joint State-Private Yinghe Restaurant, and others, out of resentment towards worker Yan Zhuo for his usual supervision of their illegal activities, unreasonably beat Yan Zhuo severely, causing serious injuries. After the incident, the West District catering industry grassroots trade union, representing the interests of the workers, appealed to the West District People's Court for handling. However, the court neither fully believed the grassroots trade union's appeal nor conducted any investigation, and simply dismissed the case as a general civil matter, refusing to accept it. Later, Yan Zhuo himself wrote a letter appealing to the West District Court, but the West District Court still refused to accept it. The West District catering industry grassroots trade union later appealed to the West District People's Procuratorate, but the procurator general also regarded the case as an ordinary one, only handing it over to the investigation team for review, and then never inquired about it again. After investigation, Song Miaoyu (a member of the Chinese Communist Party), an investigator, proposed a personal handling opinion of "the criminal responsibility of Feng Zhu and other criminals should not be pursued" on the grounds that Yan Zhuo's injuries were not severe enough to cause disability. Until the Municipal Public Security Bureau was about to arrest the criminals Feng Zhu and others, the Municipal Procuratorate still disagreed with the arrest. Cadres of the North District and East District Courts of Guangzhou also had similar situations in handling cases of the same nature.

Because some cadres in the Guangzhou municipal political and legal departments did not handle such cases promptly according to national law, coupled with the influence of the rampant attacks on the Party by right-wing elements in various places, this fueled the arrogance of illegal capitalists in resisting reform and hating workers. In the past month or so, several such cases have occurred one after another in various districts of Guangzhou. The working masses are dissatisfied with the relevant departments' failure to handle such cases promptly.

Recently, relevant personnel of the Guangzhou Procuratorate and Court have examined the right-leaning thought shown in the handling of these cases. They have decided to resolutely handle cases of capitalist personnel hating and beating workers.

On the 14th, the Guangzhou Municipal People's Court sentenced Feng Zhu, the principal culprit and illegal capitalist who beat progressive worker Yan Zhuo, to eight years of imprisonment, and accomplices Feng Chun and Feng Rong were sentenced to three years and two years of imprisonment respectively.

### 为什么不及时处理资本家殴打工人事件？  广州市检察院和法院有关人员检查右倾思想

    为什么不及时处理资本家殴打工人事件？
    广州市检察院和法院有关人员检查右倾思想
    据新华社广州14日电　广州市政法部门的一部分干部，最近检查和批判了在处理不法资本家殴打进步工人案件中的右倾思想，并且立即扭转了这种右倾思想。
    6月18日，广州市西区公私合营应合饭店私方经理冯柱等，因痛恨工人严焯平时监督他们的不法行为，无理痛殴严焯，以致重伤。事发后，西区饮食业基层工会代表工人利益，上告西区人民法院请求处理。但法院既不充分相信基层工会的申诉，又不作任何调查，便简单地认为这个案件只是一般民事案件，不予受理。后来，严焯本人写信上诉西区法院，西区法院仍不受理。西区饮食业基层工会后来又上告西区人民检察院，但检察长也把这一案件看作平常案件，只是交侦查组审查，自己以后就一直不加过问。侦查组把办案的责任交给侦查员宋妙玉（中共党员），宋妙玉在调查以后，以严焯的伤势不致成残废为理由，提出了“不应追究冯柱等罪犯刑事责任”的个人处理意见。直到市公安局要逮捕凶犯冯柱等人前，市检察院仍提出不同意逮捕。广州市北区和东区法院干部在处理同样性质的案件中，也有类似情况。
    由于广州市政法部门一部分干部没有根据国法及时地处理这类案件，加上各地右派分子向党猖狂进攻的影响，这就助长了不法资本家抗拒改造、仇视工人的气焰。一个多月以来，广州各区接连发生了这类案件好几起。工人群众对有关部门不及时处理这类案件，是不满意的。
    最近，广州检察院和法院有关人员已经检查了在处理这些案件中所表现的右倾思想。他们已决定坚决地处理资方人员仇恨工人和殴打工人的案件。
    14日，广州市人民法院判处殴打进步工人严焯的主犯、不法资本家冯柱有期徒刑八年，帮凶冯纯和冯荣分别被判处有期徒刑三年和两年。
