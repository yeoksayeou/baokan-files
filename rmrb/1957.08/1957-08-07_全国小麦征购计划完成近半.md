Xinhua News Agency, 6th: The national wheat procurement work has completed nearly half of the planned amount.

According to statistics from the Ministry of Food, by July 25th, the wheat already stored accounted for more than 45% of the wheat procurement plan. About half of this was stored in the 25 days of July. Major wheat-producing provinces such as Shandong, Henan, and Anhui have completed 60% to 75% of their plans; Hebei Province has completed more than 50% of its plan; Jiangsu and Shaanxi provinces are below or far below half of their plans.

The quality of the wheat stored this year is better than last year. The grains are full, the moisture content does not exceed 14%, and impurities account for only 1%. The amount of wheat stored by July 25th has increased compared to the same period last year. However, the Ministry of Food believes that last year was a disaster year, and the wheat harvest season was late, while this year's harvest season was early, so the current amount of storage is actually not large. Compared with the same period in the normal year of 1955, the amount of storage has decreased by about 2 billion catties. Currently, the procurement progress is slow, and the procurement quantity is showing a downward trend.

Why is the wheat procurement progress slow this year, and the amount of storage not large? According to the Ministry of Food's analysis, heavy rain and floods in some areas have had some impact on wheat procurement work, but the more important issue is ideological. Some areas' farmers only see personal interests, not overall interests, and unrealistically demand further improvements in their lives, asking to sell less grain and keep more, or demanding higher grain retention standards, etc. These thoughts have seriously affected the smooth progress of the procurement work. Therefore, the Ministry of Food believes that to complete this year's wheat procurement plan, all parties still need to make arduous efforts, especially to strengthen ideological education in rural areas.

### 全国小麦征购计划完成近半

    全国小麦征购计划完成近半
    新华社6日讯　全国小麦征购工作完成了计划的近半数。
    据粮食部统计，到7月25日止，全国已入库的小麦占小麦征购计划的45％多。其中有一半左右是7月份二十五天内入库的。主要产麦区山东、河南、安徽等省完成了计划的60％到75％；河北省完成了计划的50％多；江苏、陕西等省不及或远不及计划的一半。
    今年已入库的小麦，比去年质量好。颗粒饱满，水份不超过14％，杂质仅占1％。到7月25日止小麦的入库量，和去年同期比较有所增加。但粮食部认为，去年是灾年，小麦收获季节晚，今年收获季节早，现在的入库量实际上是不多的。如和正常年的1955年同期比较，入库量减少了二十亿斤左右。目前，征购进度迟缓，征购数量有下降的趋势。
    为什么今年小麦征购进度迟缓，入库量不多呢？据粮食部分析，部分地区暴雨成灾，对小麦征购工作有些影响，但是更主要的是思想问题。有些地区农民只看到个人利益，看不到整体利益，脱离实际地要求进一步改善生活，对粮食要求少卖多分，或者要求提高留粮标准等。这些思想，严重地影响了征购工作的顺利进行。因此粮食部认为，要完成今年的小麦征购计划，各方面还需要做艰巨的努力，特别是要加强农村的思想教育工作。
