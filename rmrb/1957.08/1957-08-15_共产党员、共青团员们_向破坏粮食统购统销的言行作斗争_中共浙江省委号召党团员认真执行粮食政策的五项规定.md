Communist Party Members, Communist Youth League Members,
    Fight Against Words and Deeds that Undermine the Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain
    The CPC Zhejiang Provincial Committee Calls on Party and League Members to Conscientiously Implement the Five Provisions of the Grain Policy

    (Our newspaper, Hangzhou, 14th dispatch) The CPC Zhejiang Provincial Committee issued five provisions on August 9 regarding Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members taking the lead in implementing the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain and the "Three Fixes." The provisions state that currently, capitalist forces in the countryside are using methods such as concealing the area and yield of grain cultivation, falsely reporting the population, delaying grain purchase quotas, speculating in grain for profit, and claiming shortages when there are none, in order to undermine the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain. All Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members must resolutely defend socialism and ensure the implementation of the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain in this sharp struggle. To this end, Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members are required to strictly abide by the following five provisions:

    I. Resolutely implement the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain and the "Three Fixes," and fight against all kinds of thoughts and behaviors that violate the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain and the "Three Fixes." Never blindly listen to the clamor of various bad elements.

    II. Take the lead in mobilizing the agricultural production cooperatives and families to which they belong to complete the unified purchase and public grain tasks in accordance with the grain "Three Fixes" standards. Do not falsely report the amount of supply, and do not ask the state for more grain. Persuade and mobilize the surrounding masses to complete the unified purchase and public grain tasks, and ensure that the unified sales quotas are not exceeded.

    III. Report truthfully the grain planting area, yield, and population of the agricultural production cooperatives or families to which they belong, and never conceal or falsely report. Persuade and mobilize the surrounding masses to report the planting area, yield, and population truthfully, and resolutely fight against acts of concealing the true situation.

    IV. Model the observance of state regulations on grain market management, never use rations for sideline businesses, never sell grain, never buy or sell grain coupons, and never exchange grain for other commodities. Resolutely fight against black market speculation in grain.

    V. Educate their families to be careful and economical, and use grain in a planned way, ensuring that they have enough to eat and use within their own retained grain. Never ask the state to increase the supply beyond the grain "Three Fixes" retention amount, and resolutely fight against the phenomenon of wasting grain.

    本报杭州14日电　中共浙江省委在8月9日发出了关于共产党员、共青团员要带头执行粮食统购统销和“三定”政策的五项规定。规定说，现在农村资本主义势力正采用隐瞒粮食种植面积和产量、虚报人口、拖欠粮食征购任务、贩卖粮食投机牟利、不缺叫缺等办法来破坏粮食统购统销政策。所有共产党员和共青团员在这个尖锐的斗争中，必须坚决保卫社会主义、保证执行粮食统购统销政策。为此，要求共产党员、共青团员严格遵守以下五项规定。
    一、坚决执行粮食统购统销与“三定”政策，同各种违反粮食统购统销与“三定”政策的思想与行为作斗争，决不能盲目听信各种坏分子的叫嚣。
    二、要以身作则动员自己所属的农业生产合作社与家庭按照粮食“三定”标准，完成统购与公粮任务，不虚报供应量，不多要国家粮食。要说服与动员周围群众完成统购与公粮任务，保证不突破统销指标。
    三、要忠诚老实报告自己所属的农业生产合作社或家庭的粮食种植面积、产量、人口，决不隐瞒、虚报。要说服和动员周围群众实报种植面积、产量、人口，坚决同隐瞒真实情况的行为作斗争。
    四、要模范地遵守国家粮食市场管理的规定，决不拿口粮搞副业，决不贩卖粮食，决不买卖粮票，决不拿粮食调换其他商品，坚决同粮食的黑市投机活动作斗争。
    五、要教育自己的家庭精打细算，有计划的节约使用粮食，保证在自己的留粮以内够吃够用，决不在粮食“三定”留量以外要国家增加供应，坚决同浪费粮食的现象作斗争。
