Right-wing Struggle Has Begun to Penetrate Small and Medium-Sized Cities

The struggle against the rightists has begun to penetrate deeply into various small and medium-sized cities. Facts have proven that rightists also exist in small and medium-sized cities. Under the counterattack of the massive anti-rightist struggle, their reactionary words and deeds have been exposed.

    Nanchong: Zhang Mosheng, Zhang Chonggu, Wu Zhongfu
    △ Zhang Mosheng, Chairman of the Nanchong Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League in Sichuan, and Vice Chairmen Zhang Chonggu and Wu Zhongfu, were henchmen of Pan Dakui, the Sichuan agent of the Zhang-Luo Alliance. Wu Zhongfu slandered, saying: "Party rule is the root of sectarianism, and the proletarian dictatorship is the root of the three evils." "The Party's secrecy system is the basis for the growth of arrogance and complacency among Communist Party members."

    Xichong: Yang Chengyi
    △ Rightist Yang Chengyi is the Chairman of the Xichong County Branch of the China Democratic League and the Principal of Xichong Middle School. At the beginning of the rectification campaign, he clamored that the Communist Party was about to collapse, and he incited people to attack the Party. He said: "All the chaos originated in Beijing." He believed that the democratic parties should divide the world equally with the Communist Party, and his position and power should be the same as those of the Communist Party County Committee Secretary. He opposed the Communist Party developing Party members among intellectuals, shouting for the Party to withdraw from schools.

    Zigong City: Luo Xiaoyuan
    △ Luo Xiaoyuan, Chairman of the Zigong Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association and a member of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, was exposed in the anti-rightist struggle in the industrial and commercial circles of Zigong City as a rightist with a strong idea of changing the regime. He was worried about being unable to escape if Chiang Kai-shek returned even after becoming the Deputy Mayor; he publicly recited poems praising Chiang Kai-shek during last year's National Day. He opposed the Party's socialist transformation of private industry and commerce, and he spread rumors everywhere, encouraging the industrial and commercial circles to resist the transformation.

    Cang County: Zhang Yuxing, Wang Jianxin, Chi Pengqi
    △ Zhang Yuxing, Wang Jianxin, Chi Pengqi and others, teachers at Cang County No. 1 Middle School in Hebei, applauded and laughed after reading the speech of rightist leader Luo Longji at the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee, and took the newspaper to the branch secretary and said: "You should take a good look!" All the teachers and students of Cang County No. 1 Middle School spared three days during the tense examination period to counterattack the rightists in the school.

    Fucheng: Zhang Jixiang, Du Youhai
    △ Zhang Jixiang, a teacher at Fucheng Middle School in Hebei, called the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Office in the middle of the night after seeing Luo Longji's speech, questioning: "How did you come to a conclusion about me? I want to appeal to the Rehabilitation Committee!" Du Youhai shouted "It's really gratifying!" after reading Chu Anping's "Party Empire" speech and said to the Party member principal: "I won't offer any more opinions to you. Chu Anping's speech is also my speech."

    Botou: Zuo Wenzhou, Zhou Baitang
    △ Zuo Wenzhou and Zhou Baitang, students in the teacher training class of Botou City, Hebei, even compared Party members and League members to "four pests" during the rectification campaign, inciting students to "eliminate the Party and League organizations in the school."

    Yuncheng: Wang Shijie
    △ Kangjie Middle School in Yuncheng, Shanxi, has been exposing the reactionary remarks of Wang Shijie, a teacher in the Chinese language group of the school, for days. In the course of airing views, he put forward four reactionary programs in the name of the Chinese language group: "1. Resolutely reverse the errors of imitating Stalin's only class and only historical theories; 2. Strictly implement the freedom of speech stipulated in the Constitution; 3. Resolutely reverse the tendency of the Party branch becoming a prison and Party members becoming plainclothes police; 4. Quickly correct the errors and shortcomings of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries." The teachers of Kangjie Middle School refuted these four reactionary programs one by one; the students exposed the fact that he had consistently poisoned young people in teaching and peddled reactionary remarks. At the same time, workers, peasants and government cadres in Anyi County also participated in the struggle to counterattack Wang Shijie, using facts to criticize his slander of the Party and the state.
