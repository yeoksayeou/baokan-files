Urumqi City Units Actively Improve Work

    (Our newspaper dispatch) Urumqi City's various government offices and enterprises have paid attention to improving their work during the rectification movement. In the past, the procurement personnel dispatched to the interior of the country by the various specialized companies under the Commercial Department were mostly Han comrades, who were often unfamiliar with the commodities favored by ethnic minorities. Now, various companies are gradually increasing the number of ethnic minority procurement personnel. The Geological Survey Department of the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration Bureau had a large number of management personnel and surveyors in its field teams. Now, based on the suggestion of engineer Meng Ersheng, the Geological Survey Department has combined gravity, magnetism, and traverse surveys into a joint team, reducing the number of administrators, cooks, and surveyors, and also improving work efficiency. Of the 330 suggestions put forward by the workers of the August 1st Steel Plant in July, 45.3% have now been processed. Some of the 35 suggestions already processed by the Autonomous Region's First Engineering Company have had a positive effect on production. For example, after the transportation team's repair shop of this company reformed its work procedures and wage system, the car repair efficiency in June increased by 123% compared with the same period last year.

    乌鲁木齐市各单位积极改进工作
    本报讯  乌鲁木齐市各机关和企业单位在整风运动中注意改进工作。商业厅所属各专业公司过去派往关内的采购员，汉族同志较多，他们对少数民族所喜爱的商品往往不熟悉。现在各公司逐步增加了民族采购员。新疆石油管理局地质调查处所属各野外队管理人员和测工较多，现在根据工程师孟尔盛的建议，地质调查处将重力、磁力、导线测量合并为联队，减少了管理员、炊事员和测工，还提高了工效。八一钢铁厂的职工在7月份提出的三百三十件意见中现在已经处理了45.3％。自治区第一工程公司已经处理的三十五项建议中，有些建议对生产已起了积极的作用。像这个公司的运输队修理班改建了工序和工资制度后，6月份的修车效率比去年同期提高了123％。
