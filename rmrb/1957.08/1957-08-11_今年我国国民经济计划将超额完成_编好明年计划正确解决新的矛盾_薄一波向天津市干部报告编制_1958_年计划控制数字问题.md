Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 10th. After inspecting work in Tianjin, Vice Premier of the State Council Bo Yibo delivered a report to more than 1,000 leading cadres in the city on the morning of the 9th, concerning several issues in compiling the 1958 plan control figures.

Bo Yibo first pointed out that the execution of the 1957 national economic plan is basically good, and it is expected that the plan can be overfulfilled. Industrial production is expected to exceed the Five-Year Plan target by more than 13%. Steel production will increase from 1.349 million tons in 1952 to more than 5 million tons in 1957. Heavy-duty trucks and jet aircraft have long been produced in large quantities. Complete sets of 72,500-kilowatt hydroelectric power equipment, 25,000-kilowatt thermal power equipment, 2,500-ton hydraulic presses, complete sets of 700 mm rolling mills, 80-ton electric locomotives, 5,000-ton freighters, 40-horsepower tractors, etc., have been trial-produced and will begin production. Agricultural production is expected to exceed the Five-Year Plan target by 2.5%. Grain output will increase from 308.8 billion jin in 1952 to 382 billion jin in 1957. Cotton output will increase from 26.07 million dan in 1952 to 30 million dan. Basic construction is expected to exceed the Five-Year Plan target by 14%. During the first Five-Year Plan period, the number of construction units of factories and mines above the quota will reach 825, exceeding the original 694 by 131. The newly added production capacity expected in the five years, calculated by annual output, will increase raw coal by 45.28 million tons, electricity by 10.47 billion kilowatt-hours, petroleum by 1.265 million tons, pig iron by 3.094 million tons, steel by 2.17 million tons, cotton yarn by 1.61 million pieces, cotton cloth by 1.41 billion meters, machine-made paper by 215,000 tons, and machine-made sugar by 155,000 tons. On the basis of continuous development of production and continuous growth of basic construction, the scope of social employment has expanded, and the average wage of workers and staff is expected to increase by about 37% compared with 1952, exceeding the original planned target of 33%. The income of the vast majority of farmers has also increased considerably. We can say with certainty that China's first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy will be overfulfilled. The initial foundation of China's socialist industrialization will be established. China is basically able to build its own power stations, mining enterprises, medium-sized metallurgical enterprises, metal processing enterprises, chemical industry enterprises, and light industry enterprises with its own manufactured equipment. China has begun to equip its transportation departments, agricultural departments, and strengthen national defense with its own manufactured machinery. Every patriotic person is very happy about this prosperous scene of the motherland, but the bourgeois rightists hate it extremely. They say that China's socialist construction is terrible, the lives of the Chinese people have not improved, and they are even on the verge of starvation. The rightists vainly attempt to obliterate objective existence and drag the wheels of history backward, which is of course futile.

    Ten Issues in Next Year's Plan

Now we must start compiling the control figures for the 1958 national economic plan. 1958 is the first year of China's second Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy. The compilation of the 1958 national economic plan must be based on Chairman Mao's instructions on correctly handling contradictions among the people, the relevant principles and policies determined by the Party and the government, the experience in the implementation of the first Five-Year Plan, and the requirements for the long-term development of the national economy, so as to arrange various planned targets both actively and reliably, in order to correctly resolve the new contradictions that have emerged in China's national economic development.

The main contradiction newly emerging in the current development of China's national economy is that the development of consumer goods production cannot keep up with the needs of the development of the means of production, especially the development of agricultural production cannot keep up with the needs of the entire national economic development. At the same time, in the development of the means of production, the development of the raw materials industry cannot keep up with the needs of the development of the processing and manufacturing industry. Thus, a new contradiction has also emerged between the accumulation and consumption of China's national income: the improvement of the people's consumption level is slow, and most of the increased income of the country can only be used for accumulation. Correctly resolving the above-mentioned contradictions is the main task of compiling the 1958 national economic plan and the second Five-Year Plan period. Therefore, the guiding principle for compiling the 1958 plan control figures should be to implement the policy of attaching equal importance to the development of industry and agriculture, and to accelerate the development of agriculture; to actively develop the raw materials industry, especially to develop certain special and undersupplied raw materials industries; to continue to implement the policy of combining large, medium, and small enterprises and making full use of small industries and handicrafts; to pay attention to making the development of railway transportation adapt to the needs of production development; and to strengthen the regulatory role of foreign trade in domestic production and markets. At the same time, we should continue to economize on military and administrative expenses, reduce the standards and investment in non-productive construction, and further implement the Party's policy of building the country through diligence and thrift.

Bo Yibo then explained the above-mentioned principles, raised ten issues, and discussed them with everyone.

    Accelerate the Development of Agriculture

First, the issue of developing agricultural production. In 1958, investment in agricultural development should be appropriately increased. The state's investment in basic construction related to agricultural development, agricultural loans, and expenditure on undertakings should be considered in conjunction with the investment of agricultural production cooperatives themselves, and unified planning and appropriate arrangements should be implemented, so as to better exert the economic effect of investment in agriculture. The use of agricultural development investment mainly has four aspects: namely, water conservancy construction, drainage, land reclamation, and the development of chemical fertilizers. Only by doing a good job in these four aspects in a planned way can we further increase the yield per unit area and expand the cultivated area. In addition, in the development of agriculture, attention should be paid to appropriately grasping the proportional relationship between the planting area of food crops and technical crops. Judging from the current situation, it is more appropriate to maintain the cotton planting area at the level of 90 million mu. In the newly expanded cultivated area in the future, there should also be an appropriate proportion of cotton planting. At the same time, attention should be paid to not reducing and appropriately increasing the planting area of high-yield cotton fields in the existing cotton fields as much as possible. And we must vigorously correct the phenomenon of abandoning mountain farmland in some areas. The issue of developing agriculture is a particularly important issue in our country. Because agriculture can provide raw materials and markets for light industry, agriculture is an important market for many heavy industrial products, it is a basic condition for improving people's lives, it is an important source of national capital accumulation, and it is the main source of China's export goods at this stage. The development of agriculture can not only improve people's lives, but also promote the development of light and heavy industries.

    Actively Develop the Raw Materials Industry

Second, develop the raw materials industry. The main tasks of developing the raw materials industry are: on the one hand, to meet the needs of China's construction and development, and on the other hand, to increase the needs of exports. In meeting the needs of domestic construction, we should concentrate our efforts on developing industries such as chemical fertilizers and coal to promote agricultural development; at the same time, we should develop industries such as ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals, petroleum, salt, and alkali to meet the needs of the development of manufacturing industries, transportation machinery industries, and chemical industries. In expanding exports, the main thing is to increase the production of coal, pig iron, salt, non-ferrous metals, and non-metallic products, so as to appropriately increase the proportion of mineral exports and reduce the proportion of agricultural exports. All exported mineral products should be processed domestically as much as possible before being exported, so as to fully develop China's production undertakings. In the mining and processing of the raw materials industry, large enterprises should be combined with small and medium-sized enterprises, mechanized mining should be combined with manual mining, and state-owned mining should be combined with mass mining. It is possible to encourage relevant handicraft production cooperatives and agricultural production cooperatives (as a sideline) to open small coal mines, small iron mines, small non-ferrous metal mines, small non-metallic mines, small salt fields, and small alkali fields, etc., so as to give full play to China's abundant human resources to develop China's rich resources.

    Overall Arrangement of the Machinery Industry

Third, overall arrangement of the machinery industry. During the first Five-Year Plan period, China's machinery industry has developed rapidly; at the same time, the production capacity of some national defense industries has become possible to shift to civilian production, and the production of raw materials industries cannot fully meet the needs of the processing and manufacturing industries. Therefore, in the future, investment in the development of general machinery industries will be appropriately reduced, and efforts will be concentrated on developing heavy and precision machinery. For the existing machinery industry, it should be unified planned and appropriately arranged under the conditions of combining peacetime and wartime, specialization and collaboration, manufacturing and repair, mechanical departments and non-mechanical manufacturing departments, and the central and local governments, so as to give full play to its role. Products that are temporarily not needed by the society should be reduced as much as possible; products that are needed by the society should be actively increased, and efforts should be made to conduct trial production and production of new types of products, so as to strive to have the vast majority of machinery and equipment needed during the second Five-Year Plan period solved domestically.

    Appropriately Develop Light Industry

Fourth, develop light industry to appropriately meet the needs of the people. Due to the limitation of raw material supply, investment in light industry will be reduced in 1958. In view of the shortage of agricultural raw material production and the serious lack of timber, the development of the textile industry using agricultural raw materials and the paper industry and artificial fiber industry using timber as raw materials should be appropriately restricted in the future. However, various existing fiber raw materials in the country (such as cotton stalk skin, wild hemp, ramie, domestic silkworm silk, tussah silkworm silk, castor silkworm silk, etc.) should be fully utilized. Don't dislike it being little or troublesome, use as much as you have.

For the sugar and paper industries, appropriate development should be made according to the possibility of raw materials. For salt production, investment should be increased to meet domestic consumption and export needs.

The contradiction between the production and needs of light industrial consumer goods, especially cotton cloth and knitted goods, is quite tense. In order to solve this contradiction and appropriately meet the needs of the people, in addition to actively increasing the production of agricultural raw materials, it is an important task at present to vigorously strengthen socialist education for farmers, do a good job in purchasing, and increase the commercialization rate of agricultural products, especially the commercialization rate of grain and cotton.

    Correspondingly Develop Transportation

Fifth, develop transportation. Due to the development of industrial and agricultural production, especially the development of raw materials industry production and the increase in basic construction investment, transportation in 1958, especially in certain sections of railways and railway transportation in new industrial areas, will be very tense; at the same time, the transportation business of ports in the Yangtze River and Hainan Island will also be very tense, and investment in these areas must be increased and work in these areas must be strengthened. Local transportation is mainly solved by mobilizing the masses to use folk transportation tools.

    Actively and Flexibly Conduct Foreign Trade

Sixth, foreign trade. In view of the contradictions existing in the development of China's economic construction, especially the contradiction between the needs and supply possibilities of certain special raw materials, it is impossible to completely solve it domestically not only now but also in a fairly long period of time in the future. It must be adjusted through foreign trade to seek a solution. Our foreign trade plan must adapt to this new situation and adopt an active and flexible policy.

In terms of exports, we should actively increase the proportion of mineral and machinery product exports. For the export of mineral products, various departments should take effective measures to meet the requirements of exports in terms of quantity, variety, and specifications. Under the condition of not destroying mineral resources, various places should also appropriately increase some investment, actively develop local and folk mining industries, and increase the export of mineral products. Foreign trade departments should also actively organize exports and expand foreign markets according to the possibility of domestic machinery industry production. We should vigorously increase the proportion of secondary commodity exports. In this regard, the potential of various places is very large, especially for some scattered materials with export traditions, various places should vigorously organize production, collect and export, and gradually reduce the proportion of agricultural products and agricultural processed product exports. In terms of imports, we should try to reduce the import of machinery and equipment as much as possible. For machinery and equipment that can be produced domestically, even if the quality is lower than that of imported ones and the price is higher than that of imported ones, we should not import or import less, but should be supplied by domestic production. We should increase the import of certain special materials and light industrial raw materials that are lacking domestically. This is very necessary for promoting domestic production and arranging the market, and should be the main aspect of import trade in the future. We should also try to reduce the import of high-end consumer goods and other industrial finished products.

    Give Play to the Economic Effects of Investment

Seventh, give play to the economic effects of investment. In addition to the rational arrangement of investment proportions in various departments mentioned above, it is also very important to strive to increase the proportion of productive construction investment and greatly reduce the proportion of non-productive construction investment. In 1958, office buildings, auditoriums, guesthouses, etc. will not be built at all; dormitories, shops, cooperatives, banks, etc. should also not be built or built as little as possible, except for those that are absolutely necessary in new industrial areas. Regardless of productive and non-productive construction, the cost should be appropriately reduced under the principle of ensuring quality and applicability. In the aspect of non-productive construction, special attention should be paid. In order to give play to the economic effects of investment, the issue of the paid use of national funds should also be considered. In this way, we can promote the rational use of funds and truly implement economic accounting.

    Reasonably Organize the Economy

Eighth, reasonably organize the economy. The main thing is to do a good job in the cooperation of enterprises in the three aspects of supply, production, and sales. In the future, when examining the design of new enterprises, if there is no economic and reasonable cooperative relationship between supply, production, and sales, the construction project should not be approved. Among existing enterprises, the relationship between supply, production, and sales should also be appropriately fixed according to the principle of economic rationality. This is a huge task for rationally organizing the national economy. Only by doing a good job in this task can the production organization between departments be rationalized, can regional balance and rational transportation be truly achieved, can the current supply and sales relationship be greatly improved, and can the planning work be improved.

    Improve the Basic Construction Planning System

Ninth, improve the planning system of basic construction. At present, the planning system of basic construction is divided into two systems, the central and local governments, which often cause some unnecessary waste due to mutual discord and each going its own way. With the improvement of the entire system, in addition to appropriately increasing the proportion of local investment in the investment ratio between the central and local governments, a unified basic construction plan divided by region should also be compiled in the future, so that the local government can not only consider the rationality of local investment, but also consider the rationality of the investment of enterprises and institutions managed by the central government in the local area. Making the construction undertakings of the central and local governments closely integrated is of great benefit to mutual promotion and development.

    Implement the Policy of Building the Country Through Diligence and Thrift

Tenth, rationally use funds to implement the Party's policy of building the country through diligence and thrift. As mentioned earlier, because the production of consumer goods in our country cannot keep up with the needs of the development of the means of production, a new contradiction has emerged between the accumulation and consumption of national income. In order to correctly solve this contradiction, we must rationally use funds in accordance with the Party's policy of building the country through diligence and thrift. In the future, with the development of the national economy, our country will increase a certain amount of national income and fiscal revenue every year. For these incomes, we must first make a rational distribution between accumulation and consumption. However, because the growth of consumer goods production in our country is slow, which restricts the improvement of people's consumption level, most of the increased part of national income and national fiscal revenue each year can only be used for accumulation. However, there are contradictions between increasing fixed assets and increasing current assets for funds used for accumulation. Of course, excessively increasing current assets is not conducive to expanding the development of reproduction; and if excessively increasing investment in basic construction, it will increase the pressure on the market. The question now is how to implement the Party's policy of building the country through diligence and thrift and use these accumulated funds most effectively to overcome the weak links in China's economic development, especially to develop agriculture and raw materials industries. In this way, it will not only increase the pressure on the market, but also increase consumer goods and increase export goods, which is of great benefit to easing the pressure on the market and resolving the contradiction between accumulation and consumption.

Finally, Bo Yibo also emphasized the need to give full play to the role of industrial bases in coastal areas like Tianjin. He used the Tianjin Emerging Steel Plant, Tianjin Bicycle Factory, and Tianjin Sewing Machine Factory, which he had inspected, as examples to illustrate the possibility of better utilizing this industrial base. He hoped that the cadres working in Tianjin would make greater efforts for the Party and the country in this regard.

    今年我国国民经济计划将超额完成
    编好明年计划正确解决新的矛盾
    薄一波向天津市干部报告编制1958年计划控制数字问题
    新华社天津10日电　国务院副总理薄一波在天津视察工作以后，9日上午就编制1958年计划控制数字的几个问题向全市一千多名领导干部做了报告。
    薄一波首先指出：1957年度国民经济计划执行情况基本上是良好的，预计可以超额完成计划：工业生产预计将超过五年计划指标13％以上，钢铁的生产量将由1952年的一百三十四点九万吨提高到1957年的五百余万吨。载重汽车、喷气式飞机，早已大量生产，七万二千五百瓩的全套水力发电设备、二万五千瓩的全套火力发电设备、二千五百吨的水压机、七百公厘的全套轧钢机、八十吨的电机车、五千吨的货轮、四十马力的拖拉机等等，经过试制亦将开始生产。农业生产，预计将超过五年计划指标2.5％，粮食产量将由1952年的三千零八十八亿斤提高到1957年的三千八百二十亿斤，棉花产量将由1952年的二千六百零七万担，提高到三千万担。基本建设预计将超过五年计划指标14％。在第一个五年计划期间施工的限额以上的厂矿企业建设单位将达到八百二十五项，比原定的六百九十四项超过一百三十一项。五年预计新增加的生产能力，按每年的产量计算，原煤增加四千五百二十八万吨，电力增加一百零四点七亿度，石油增加一百二十六点五万吨，生铁增加三百零九点四万吨，钢铁增加二百一十七万吨，棉纱增加一百六十一万件，棉布增加十四点一亿公尺，机制纸增加二十一点五万吨，机制糖增加十五点五万吨。在生产不断发展，基本建设不断增长的基础上，社会就业面扩大了，职工的平均工资比1952年预计将增长37％左右，超过原定计划增长33％的指标。绝大多数农民的收入，也有相当的增加。我们完全可以这样说：我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划将要超额完成了。我国社会主义工业化的初步基础将要建立起来了。我国基本上已经能够用自己制造的设备，建设自己的电站、采矿企业、中型冶金企业、金属加工企业、化学工业企业和轻工业企业了。我国已经开始用自己制造的机械，装备自己的运输部门、农业部门和加强国防了。对于祖国这种欣欣向荣的景象，每个具有爱国心的人都是非常高兴的，但是资产阶级右派分子则极端仇恨。他们说：我国的社会主义建设糟透了，我国人民的生活没有什么改善，甚至处在饿死的边缘。右派分子妄想抹煞客观的存在，妄想把历史车轮往后拖，这当然是徒劳无功的。
    明年计划中的十个问题
    现在就要着手编制1958年度国民经济计划的控制数字了。1958年是我国发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的第一年。1958年度国民经济计划的编制，必须根据毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的指示，根据党和政府所确定的有关的方针政策，根据第一个五年计划执行过程中的经验和国民经济长远发展的要求，既积极又可靠地安排各项计划指标，以便正确地解决我国国民经济发展中所出现的新的矛盾。
    目前我国国民经济发展中新出现的主要矛盾是消费资料生产的发展赶不上生产资料生产发展的需要，特别是农业生产的发展赶不上整个国民经济发展的需要。同时，在生产资料的发展方面，原材料工业的发展又赶不上加工制造工业发展的需要。这样，在我国国民收入的积累同消费之间，也就出现了新的矛盾：人民消费水平的提高较慢，国家所增加的收入大部分只能用于积累。正确地解决上面所说的各种矛盾，是编制1958年度国民经济计划和第二个五年计划期中的主要任务。因此，编制1958年度计划控制数字的方针，应该是贯彻执行发展工业同发展农业并重的方针，加速农业的发展；积极地发展原材料工业、特别是发展某些特殊的和供应不足的原材料工业；继续贯彻执行大、中、小型企业相结合和充分利用小工业、手工业的政策；注意使铁路运输的发展适应于生产发展的需要；加强对外贸易对于国内生产和市场的调剂作用。同时，应该继续节俭军政费用，降低非生产性建设的标准和投资，进一步贯彻执行党的勤俭建国的方针。
    薄一波接着就上述方针，提出十个问题进行了说明，并同大家商榷。
    加速农业的发展
    第一是发展农业生产的问题。1958年应当适当地增加对于发展农业的投资。把国家对于有关发展农业的基本建设投资、农贷、事业费开支同农业生产合作社本身的投资结合起来考虑，实行统一规划、适当安排，这样，才能更好地发挥对农业投资的经济效果。发展农业投资的用途，主要有四个方面：即：兴修水利、排涝、开荒、发展化学肥料。只有有计划地做好这四个方面的工作，才能进一步提高单位面积产量和扩大耕地面积。此外，在发展农业方面，要注意适当掌握粮食作物同技术作物种植面积的比例关系。以目前的情况看，棉花的种植面积，以保持在九千万亩的水平上是比较适宜的。今后在新扩大的耕地面积中，也应有适当的比例种植棉花。同时，在现有的棉田中，注意尽量不减少并适当地增加高产区棉田的种植面积。并且要大力纠正某些地区废弃山区农田的现象。发展农业的问题，在我国是一个特别重要的问题。因为农业能为轻工业提供原料和市场，农业是许多重工业产品的重要市场，是改善人民生活的基本条件，是国家资金积累的重要来源，是现阶段我国出口物资的主要来源。农业发展了，不仅可以改善人民的生活，而且可以促进轻重工业的发展。
    积极发展原材料工业
    第二、发展原材料工业。发展原材料工业的主要任务在于：一方面满足我国建设发展的需要，另一方面增加出口的需要。在满足国内建设需要方面，应集中力量发展化肥、炭煤等工业，以促进农业的发展；同时发展黑色金属、有色金属、石油、盐碱等工业，以满足制造工业、运输机械工业、化学工业发展的需要。在扩大出口方面，主要是增加煤炭、生铁、食盐、有色金属和非金属产品的生产，以便适当地增加矿产量的出口比重，缩小农产品的出口比重。所有出口的矿产品，都要尽可能地在国内经过加工，再行出口，以充分发展我国的生产事业。在原材料工业的采掘和加工方面，应当是大型企业同中小型企业相结合，机械化开采同手工开采相结合，国家开采同群众开采相结合。可以提倡有关的手工业生产合作社、农业生产合作社（作为副业）来开小煤矿、小铁矿、小有色金属矿、小非金属矿、小盐场和小碱场等等，以充分发挥我国人力资源充足的条件来开发我国丰富的资源。
    统筹安排机械工业
    第三、统筹安排机械工业。在第一个五年计划期间，我国的机械工业有了迅速的发展；同时，一部分国防工业的生产能力已经有可能转向民用生产，而原材料工业的生产又不能充分满足加工制造工业的需要，因此，今后将适当地压缩对于发展一般机械工业的投资，而集中力量发展重型的和精密的机械。对于现有的机械工业，应当在平时和战时，专业和协作，制造和修理，机械部门和非机械制造部门，中央和地方相结合的条件之下，统一规划，适当安排，以充分发挥其作用。凡是社会上暂时不需要的产品，应当尽量压缩生产；凡是社会上需要的产品，应该积极增产，并且努力进行新种类产品的试制和生产，以争取在第二个五年计划期间所需的机器设备绝大部分由国内自行解决。
    适当发展轻工业
    第四、发展轻工业，适当地满足人民需要。由于原材料供应的限制，1958年对轻工业的投资将有所减少。鉴于农业原料生产不足和木材的严重缺乏，今后对于采用农业原料的纺织工业和采用木材为原料的造纸工业和人造纤维工业的发展，应作适当的限制。但对于国内现有的各种纤维原料（如棉杆皮、野麻、苎麻、家蚕丝、柞蚕丝、蓖麻蚕丝等）应充分加以利用。不要嫌少、嫌麻烦，要有多少就利用多少。
    对于食糖、造纸工业，应当根据原料的可能适当发展。对于盐的生产，要增加投资，以满足国内消费和出口的需要。
    轻工业消费品，尤其是棉布和针织品的生产同需要之间的矛盾是相当紧张的。为了解决这个矛盾，适当地满足人民的需要，除了积极增加农业原料的生产之外，大力加强对农民的社会主义教育，做好收购工作，提高农产品的商品率，特别是粮食和棉花的商品率，这是当前的一项重要任务。
    相应地发展交通运输
    第五、发展交通运输。由于工农业生产的发展，特别是原材料工业生产的发展和基本建设投资的增长，1958年的交通运输，特别是铁路的某些区段和新工业区的铁路运输，将很紧张；同时长江和海南岛港口的运输业务也很紧张，必须增加对于这些方面的投资和加强这些方面的工作。地方的交通运输，则主要通过发动群众使用民间运输工具的办法来解决。积极灵活进行对外贸易
    第六、对外贸易。鉴于我国经济建设发展中所存在的矛盾，特别是某些特殊的原材料的需要同供应可能之间的矛盾，不仅在现在而且在今后相当长的一个时期内也是不可能完全由国内解决的，必须经过对外贸易进行调剂，求得解决。我们的对外贸易计划，必须适应这种新的情况，采取积极灵活的方针。
    在出口方面，应该积极地提高矿产品和机械产品出口的比重。对于矿产品的出口，各部门应该采取有效措施，在数量上和品种规格上满足出口的要求。在不破坏矿产资源的条件下，各地也应该适当地增加一些投资，积极发展地方的和民间的采矿业，增加矿产品的出口，对外贸易部门还应该根据国内机械工业生产的可能，积极地组织出口，扩大国外市场。应该大力增加次要商品出口的比重。在这方面各地方的潜力是很大的，特别是对于一些有出口传统的零星分散的物资，各地应该大力组织生产，收集和出口，逐步地降低农产品和农产加工品出口的比重。在进口方面，应该尽量压缩机器设备的进口，凡是国内可以生产的机器设备，就是质量比进口的低和价格比进口的高，也应该不进口或少进口，而由国内生产供应。应该增加国内缺乏的某些特种器材和轻工业原材料的进口，这对于促进国内生产和安排市场是十分必需的，应该是今后进口贸易的主要方面。还应该尽量削减高级消费品及其它工业成品的进口。
    发挥投资的经济效果
    第七、发挥投资的经济效果。除了上面所说的合理安排各部门的投资比例关系之外，努力提高生产性建设投资的比重，大大压缩非生产性建设投资的比重，也是很重要的。1958年对于办公楼、大礼堂、招待所等一律不建；宿舍、商店、合作社、银行等，除新工业区十分必需者外，也应不建和尽量少建。无论生产性的和非生产性的建设，都应在保证质量和适用的原则之下，适当降低造价。在非生产性的建设方面，尤其要加以注意。为了发挥投资的经济效果，还应当考虑国家资金的有偿使用问题。这样，才能促进资金的合理使用，并且真正地贯彻执行经济核算。
    合理组织经济
    第八、合理组织经济。主要是搞好企业之间供产销三方面的协作。今后，在建设新企业审查设计的时候，如果在供产销之间没有取得经济而又合理的协作关系即不应当批准该项建设项目。在现有的企业之间，也应当根据经济合理的原则把供产销三方面的关系适当地固定化。这是合理地组织国民经济的一项巨大工作，只有做好了这项工作，才能使部门之间的生产组织合理化，才能真正地搞好地区平衡和合理运输，才能大大改善目前供销关系，才能把计划工作提高一步。
    改进基本建设计划体制
    第九、改进基本建设的计划体制。目前基本建设的计划体制，分中央和地方两个系统，常因互不通声气，各搞一套，造成某些不必要的浪费。随着整个体制的改进，除在中央同地方的投资比例关系上适当地增加对地方投资的比例之外，今后还应当编制分地区的统一的基本建设计划，使地方不仅能够考虑地方投资的合理性，而且也可能考虑当地中央所管的企业和事业单位投资的合理性。使中央的同地方的建设事业密切地结合起来。这对于相互促进发展是有很大的好处的。
    贯彻执行勤俭建国方针
    第十、合理运用资金贯彻执行党的勤俭建国的方针。前面说过，由于我国消费资料的生产赶不上生产资料生产发展的需要，因而在国民收入的积累同消费的分配之间出现了新的矛盾。为了正确地解决这一矛盾，就要根据党的勤俭建国的方针合理地运用资金。今后随着国民经济的发展，我国每年都将增加一定数量的国民收入以及财政收入。对于这些收入首先要在积累同消费之间进行合理分配。但是由于我国消费资料生产增长较慢，限制了人民的消费水平的提高，因此每年国民收入和国家财政收入的增加部分的大部分只能用于积累。但是用于积累的资金在增加固定资产和增加流动资产两个方面又存在着矛盾，当然过多地增加流动资产，是不利于扩大再生产的发展的；而如果过多地增加基本建设的投资，则又加大对于市场的压力。现在的问题是如何贯彻执行党的勤俭建国的方针，把这些积累资金最有效地用在克服我国经济发展的薄弱环节中去，特别是用在发展农业和原材料工业中去，这样，就不仅不会加大市场的压力，而且能够增加消费品，增加出口物资，这对于缓和市场的压力，解决积累和消费之间的矛盾是有很大的好处的。
    最后，薄一波还强调了要充分发挥像天津这样的沿海地区的工业基地的作用。他以视察过的天津新兴钢铁厂、天津自行车厂和天津缝纫机制造厂为例，说明了更好地利用这种工业基地的可能性。他希望天津工作的干部在这方面为党为国家作更大的努力。
