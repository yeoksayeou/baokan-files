　  To Enhance Friendly Cooperation and Understanding Between Germany and Poland
　　German Democratic Republic Establishes Cultural Center in Poland
    (Dispatch from our correspondent in Warsaw, August 28th) The German Democratic Republic Cultural and Information Center opened today in a beautifully decorated building in the center of Warsaw. The task of this center is to deepen the fraternal friendship between the German Democratic Republic and Poland, two neighboring countries, and to regularly introduce the achievements of the German Democratic Republic in technology, science, and culture to the Polish people.
    Observation here: This is a new way to strengthen friendship, cooperation, and understanding between socialist countries. This center has modern equipment and rich content. There is a cinema and music hall for screening scientific and technical films from the German Democratic Republic and holding concerts by German composers and performers. There is a conference hall where reports on various issues will be given. The three known report topics are: the threat of West German militarism, Agfacolor photography, and how to fight cancer. In addition, the center also has a library and reading room.
    The center's activities also include holding free German language classes and selling books and records, etc.
    It is understood that the establishment of such centers is reciprocal. There is already a Polish Cultural Office in Berlin, which will soon be expanded into a similar center.

　  增进德波两国友好合作和了解
　　民主德国在波兰设文化中心
    本报华沙28日电　民主德国文化和消息中心今天在华沙市中心一座装饰精美的建筑物里开幕。这个中心的任务是加深德意志民主共和国和波兰这两个近邻国家的兄弟般友谊，经常向波兰人民介绍民主德国在技术科学和文化方面的成就。
    此间观察：这是加强社会主义国家间的友谊、合作和了解的一种新形式。这个中心拥有现代化的设备和丰富的内容。这里有电影音乐厅供放映民主德国的科学技术电影和举行德国作曲家和演奏家的音乐会之用，有会议厅，这里将有各种问题的报告会，已知的三个报告的内容是：西德军国主义的威胁，阿克发彩色照相和怎样和癌作斗争。此外中心并设立图书馆和阅览室。
    这个中心的活动方式还有举办免费的德文教授班出售书籍和唱片等等。
    据了解这种中心的设立是互惠的。在柏林已经有波兰文化室，不久也将扩大到类似这样的中心。
