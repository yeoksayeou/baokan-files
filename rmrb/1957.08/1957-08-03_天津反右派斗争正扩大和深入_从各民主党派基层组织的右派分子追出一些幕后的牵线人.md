Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin Special Dispatch: The struggle against bourgeois rightists in Tianjin is gradually expanding and deepening.

    The anti-Rightist struggle in Tianjin began in mid-June, primarily among the upper echelons of the democratic parties and in universities. In early July, after studying the reports of Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou, the broad masses of cadres and intellectuals distinguished between right and wrong, drew clear lines of demarcation, and the movement vigorously unfolded. According to statistics, among the 151 units in the city where rightists have been discovered, 138 have already launched face-to-face struggles. Approximately 100,000 cadres and intellectuals have directly participated in this struggle. An ideological education movement criticizing bourgeois thought will also be carried out among factory workers, and preparations are actively underway. Ideological criticism in handicraft cooperatives is also about to begin.

    The combination of top-down and bottom-up anti-Rightist struggle has promoted the increasing depth of the struggle. The anti-Rightist struggle of democratic parties, initially hampered by weak leadership, only superficially criticized the speeches of Zhang Bojun and Zhang Naiqi. After the struggle penetrated the grassroots in mid-June, not only was a large number of rightists exposed at the grassroots level, but also the reactionary activities of the instigators behind the scenes—the responsible persons of the municipal-level organizations—were revealed. For example, through the struggle against Wang Guiqiu, Li Peiying, and Guan Songjian, members of the China Democratic League (CDL) group and engineers at the Tianjin Civil Architectural Design Institute, not only were Wang Guiqiu and others’ reactionary activities of slandering the Party organization and attempting to seize leadership of the design institute exposed, but also the anti-socialist and anti-Party conspiracies of the behind-the-scenes plotter—Wang Dachuan, Standing Committee member and Deputy Director of the Propaganda Committee of the CDL municipal committee. After launching a struggle against Wang Dachuan, rightists in the CDL grassroots organizations were exposed, such as Xiao Chuanjing, a rightist from the CDL branch of the Third Middle School, and rightists from the CDL group of the Dredging Company, both of whom had close ties with Wang Dachuan. Similarly, after exposing the conspiracy of Lei Aide and others, members of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party (CPWDP) branch of Tianjin Medical College, to seize leadership of the medical college, the reactionary activities of the behind-the-scenes instigator—Wu Menghui, Deputy Director of the Organization Department of the CPWDP Municipal Preparatory Committee—were exposed. At the same time, through the struggle against Yang Jishi, a member of the CPWDP Municipal Preparatory Committee, not only were his anti-socialist activities exposed, and further proof that Wu Menghui and others were Zhang Bojun's informants in Tianjin obtained, but also the anti-socialist activities of Huang Zhi, a rightist in the engineering and technical field, were exposed.

    With the deepening of the struggle, the masses gradually overcame their feelings of leniency and actively participated in the struggle. At the beginning of the struggle, medical personnel were very weak in their struggle against Yang Jishi due to considerations of affection, and many people still addressed him familiarly as "brother" when speaking. However, through the facts that were exposed, the eyes of the masses became brighter and brighter, and everyone actively launched a face-to-face struggle against Yang Jishi.

    After the masses' awareness increased, many units exposed new rightists in the course of the struggle. Recently, Heping District discovered five more rightists. A cadre from the Hebei District Taxation Bureau did not say a word during the "blooming and contending" period, but behind the scenes he made many vicious anti-Party remarks to cadres in other departments, saying that rising prices and shortages of materials were the result of agricultural collectivization and that these problems would not exist under private land ownership; that sectarianism was related to the social system, and the Party could not eliminate sectarianism even if it wanted to, etc. He also agreed with Zhang Naiqi's views. This rightist was recently exposed in the course of the deepening struggle.

    In order to ensure that both struggle and work are not neglected, and to facilitate the long-term persistence of this ideological struggle, relevant departments are making unified arrangements and deploying battles in conjunction with work, in order to further deepen the struggle and strive for complete victory.

### 天津反右派斗争正扩大和深入  从各民主党派基层组织的右派分子追出一些幕后的牵线人

    天津反右派斗争正扩大和深入
    从各民主党派基层组织的右派分子追出一些幕后的牵线人
    本报特约新华社天津讯　天津市反击资产阶级右派分子的斗争正在逐步扩大和深入。
    天津市反击右派的斗争是6月中旬首先在民主党派上层和高等学校内开始的。7月初，经过学习毛主席和周总理的报告，广大干部和知识分子辨明了是非、划清了界限，运动就蓬勃开展起来，据统计，在全市已发现右派分子的一百五十一个单位中，有一百三十八个单位已经展开了面对面的斗争。直接投入这一斗争的干部和知识分子约在十万人以上。在工厂职工中也将进行一次批判资产阶级思想的教育运动，目前正在积极进行准备工作。手工业合作社中的思想批判也即将开始。
    反右派斗争由上而下和由下而上地结合起来，促进了斗争的日益深入。民主党派的反右派斗争，在开始时由于领导无力，只是泛泛地批判了章伯钧、章乃器的言论。当6月中旬斗争深入到基层以后，不仅在基层揭露了大批的右派分子，而且从这里揭发出了幕后的指使者——市级组织负责人的反动活动。如天津市民用建筑设计院通过对民盟小组成员、工程师王桂丘、栗培英、关颂坚的斗争，不仅揭发了王桂丘等诬蔑党组织、企图夺取设计院的领导权的反动活动，而且揭露了幕后的牵线人——市民盟常委、宣传委员会副主任王大川的反社会主义和反党的阴谋；而在对王大川展开斗争后，又揭发出民盟基层组织中的右派分子，如第三中学民盟支部的右派分子肖传经和疏浚公司民盟小组的右派分子都和王大川有密切的联系。又如，在揭发了天津医学院农工民主党支部成员雷爱德等企图夺取医学院领导权的阴谋后，又揭露了幕后的指使者——农工市筹委组织处副处长吴孟晖的反动活动。同时，通过对农工党市筹委委员杨济时的斗争，不仅揭露了他本人的反社会主义活动和进一步证明了吴孟晖等是章伯钧在天津的坐探，而且揭发出了工程技术界右派分子黄植的反社会主义活动。
    随着斗争的深入，群众逐步克服温情主义，积极地参加斗争，医务界人士在斗争开始时，由于爱情面，对杨济时的斗争十分软弱无力，许多人发言还称兄道弟。但通过揭发出的事实，群众的眼睛愈来愈亮，大家都积极对杨济时展开了面对面的斗争。
    在群众觉悟提高之后，许多单位在斗争过程中揭发出了新的右派分子。和平区最近又发现了五名右派分子，河北区税务局一干部在鸣放时一言不发，但他却在背后和别的机关干部说了许多恶毒的反党言论，说什么物价涨、物资缺是农业合作化的结果，要是土地私有制就没有这些问题；宗派主义与社会制度有关，党不消灭宗派主义也不能消灭等等，并且同意章乃器的论调。这个右派分子最近在斗争深入的过程中被揭发了出来。
    为使斗争与工作两不误，便于长期把这一思想斗争坚持下去，有关部门正分别结合工作进行统一安排，部署战斗，以便进一步深入斗争，争取全胜。
