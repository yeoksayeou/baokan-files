Weekend by the Ma Bian River

On the 17th, a Saturday, after the rain had cleared, the roaring Ma Bian River (in Sichuan Province) began to calm down. At the joint club in Huangdan Township on the banks of the Ma Bian River, over two hundred workers gathered just as dusk fell. They were here surveying the Da(du River) Ma(bian River) hydropower station. At this moment, they were looking at picture books, playing chess, and playing cards, spending their unique weekend.

Before long, Guo Zhenyao, the captain of the Minjiang downstream survey team, led a comfort group to the club, bringing fruits, sweets, and letters of sympathy to the workers. At this time, driller Yu Ping'an said: "The tools are provided by the state, the consciousness is cultivated by the Party, and the body is nourished by the people. It is only right for us to contribute our strength." Amidst a burst of applause, Chen Tian, the oldest driller in the team, fifty-four years old, was pushed out to speak. He said: "Everyone can't let this old driller lose face. I guarantee to the team that I will complete the task." Everyone responded to him with friendly cheers.

It was already dark, and gas lamps hung high. The young men and women who loved to dance began to dance to the accompaniment of a band temporarily assembled by the team. Ma Zhonglian, the leader of the Neilie group of the first topographic team, became the most active person at the party. She played the accordion, danced, and sang. (Xinhua News Agency)

    马边河畔度周末
    17日是星期六，雨后初晴，咆哮的马边河（在四川省）水开始安静下来。在马边河畔的黄丹乡的联合俱乐部里，天刚黄昏就聚集了两百多工人。他们是在这里勘查大（渡河）马（边河）水电站的。此刻，他们在看连环图画、下象棋、打扑克牌，度着他们特有的周末。
    不一会，岷江下游勘查大队的大队长郭振耀率领慰问组来到俱乐部，为工人们带来了水果、糖食和慰问信。这时，钻探工人余平安说：“工具是国家供给的，觉悟是党培养的，肉体是人民养活的，我们出点力气是应该的。”在一阵鼓掌声中，全队年纪最大的、五十四岁的钻探工陈田师傅被推出来讲话。他说：“大伙儿可不能让我这个老钻工下不了台，我向大队保证完成任务。”大家以友爱的欢呼声回答他。
    天色已经黑了，煤气灯高悬起来。爱跳舞的小伙子和姑娘们，由队部临时凑集的乐队伴奏，开始跳舞。第一地形队内列组组长马中廉成了晚会的活跃人物。她一会儿拉手风琴，一会儿跳舞，一会儿唱歌。　（新华社）
