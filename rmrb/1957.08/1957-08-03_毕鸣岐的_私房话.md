Bi Mingqi's "Private Words"
By our reporter Zhong Lin

The bourgeois rightist Bi Mingqi had a "think tank" whose strategists were: Mi Luzhai, Zhao Tianjue, Xu Suhua, and Gao Youshan. In the in-depth anti-rightist struggle in Tianjin's industrial and commercial circles, Mi Luzhai and Zhao Tianjue defected and exposed some of Bi Mingqi's "private words," which can greatly help us understand the ugly face of the rightist Bi Mingqi.

On August 1, at the enlarged meeting of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce, according to the materials revealed by Mi Luzhai and Zhao Tianjue: After the Party Central Committee issued the rectification instructions, Bi Mingqi planned to attack. He said to his confidants that this opportunity must be seized and must not be relaxed. He sent out a group of confidants to investigate openly and secretly, specifically picking out the shortcomings of the leadership and the "masses'" dissatisfaction with the leadership as "bullets" to attack the Party. He also taught his confidants a set of "theories," saying that class relations no longer exist, and the bourgeoisie no longer has a negative side; anyone who says there is now is a dogmatist. After the attack plan was set, Bi Mingqi went to Beijing to fire cannons, asking his confidants to respond in Tianjin, and said that if there were no materials, they should read his articles. He also asked his confidants to find more people to speak out for their colleagues, and if anyone had concerns, they should say that they had Chairman Bi's support.

When the struggle to counter the rightists was launched across the country, and Bi Mingqi's reactionary remarks were also criticized, his "think tank" was very panicked. Xu Suhua traveled back and forth between Beijing and Tianjin: drafting false self-criticisms for Bi Mingqi in Beijing, testing the waters at the United Front Work Department, and inquiring about information at the Ministry of Foreign Trade; and also going to Tianjin to stabilize morale, cover up, and arrange a retreat. Xu Suhua told Bi Mingqi's confidants to spread the word that Chairman Bi had no major mistakes; he was just a little arrogant and complacent, and he made a very good self-criticism in Beijing, and some people were even learning from him! A certain central leader even shook his hand, and a certain leader also nodded to him; he will still be the deputy mayor of Tianjin, and he will still sit in the car, so please rest assured, Chairman Bi is really good.

However, Bi Mingqi's reactionary remarks were repeatedly criticized in Beijing, and Tianjin's industrial and commercial circles wanted him to go back and make a thorough explanation. Bi Mingqi returned to Tianjin and made several false self-criticisms, downplaying his errors, saying that he had no other mistakes, only those four articles had some minor problems. Many people exposed his boasting about Zhang Naiqi, his attempts to win people over to support Zhang Naiqi, and his reactionary words and deeds in Tianjin. Mi Luzhai and Zhao Tianjue further revealed that Bi Mingqi had always adopted double-dealing tactics and consistently engaged in anti-communist and anti-socialist words and deeds. Here are some examples:

During the "Five-Anti" movement, Mi Luzhai asked whether to confess about their concealment of enemy assets, but Bi Mingqi firmly refused to allow the confession, and this matter remains an unsolved case to this day. In front of people, Bi Mingqi said that the "Five-Anti" had great educational significance; in private, Bi Mingqi said that the "Five-Anti" hindered the enthusiasm of the industrial and commercial circles and was not worth the loss to the country.

During the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, Bi Mingqi went to Korea and said publicly that the Chinese and Korean soldiers were brave, but secretly praised the American army's power.

During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, he spread rumors to confuse the public, saying that there were no counter-revolutionaries anywhere! Regarding the Hu Feng issue, he distorted the facts and said that Zhou Yang was labeling Hu Feng, and that it was factional infighting in literary and art circles.

When the state implemented unified purchase and sale of grain, he said that this made the peasants unable to eat enough, and there was even less grain for feed, so it was difficult to buy pork even when queuing up. The grain supply for the urban population must be rationed, and the food consumption of capitalists and workers is different, so the grain ration is certainly different. Bi Mingqi provoked by saying that this was unequal, and that this was the same as the Japanese rationing system during the occupation period. Bi Mingqi said that agricultural cooperativization was not good, and floods washed away livestock and grain. He said that it was because no one cared about it after cooperativization, and it would not have happened if they were farming individually.

When the Party put forward the general line for the transition period, people said that the general line was a lighthouse, but Bi Mingqi said: "I can see the lighthouse, but my money is gone!"

Bi Mingqi raised his hand to pass the constitution, but gritted his teeth when he returned home, saying that one sentence in the Common Program was the basis for the "Five-Anti," and the constitution was even more powerful than the Common Program.

On the eve of the whole industry's joint state-private ownership, Mi Luzhai's wife said to Bi Mingqi: "You are really something! You can still get interest on the shares of the East Asia Company you bought." Bi replied: "What's so great, sooner or later it will all have to be given to them!"

When Asian and African countries held a meeting in Bandung, Kuomintang agents bombed a plane to murder a group of peace fighters. All the people in the country, Asia, Africa, and the world who loved peace were grieved and indignant. Bi Mingqi cheered for the agents' atrocities, saying that the Kuomintang agents were really capable!

When Kuomintang agents created riots in Kowloon, Hong Kong, Bi Mingqi said that the Kuomintang was really not simple, and the disturbances might develop to the mainland, and perhaps even turn into a major war.

Taiwan is China's territory, and the people of the whole country are determined to liberate Taiwan. Bi Mingqi said that Taiwan has the U.S. fleet, and liberation can only be an empty shout for a while.

    毕鸣岐的“私房话”
    本报记者　锺林
    资产阶级右派分子毕鸣岐有一个“智囊团”，军师们的名字是：米禄斋、赵天爵、许素华和高幼珊。在天津工商界深入开展的反右派斗争中，米禄斋、赵天爵倒戈起义，揭露了毕鸣岐的一些“私房话”，这些“私房话”很能帮助我们认识右派分子毕鸣岐的丑恶面目。
    8月1日，在民建天津市委和天津市工商联常委扩大会议上，据米禄斋和赵天爵揭露的材料说：党中央发布整风指示以后，毕鸣岐就策划进攻。他对亲信们说，这个机会要好好抓紧，千万不能放松。他撒出一批亲信，到处去明察暗访，专挑领导方面的毛病，和“群众”对领导不满的意见，作为进攻党的“子弹”。他还教给亲信们一套“理论”，说什么阶级关系早不存在，资产阶级已没有消极一面；谁要说现在还有，就说他是教条主义。进攻计划定好以后，毕鸣岐就到北京放炮，叫亲信们在天津响应，还说如果没有材料，就看他的文章。他还叫亲信们多找些人，替同行大鸣大放，要是谁有顾虑，就说有毕主委撑腰。
    当全国各地展开反击右派的斗争，毕鸣岐的反动言论也受到批判以后，他的“智囊团”非常恐慌。许素华往来京津道上：在北京给毕鸣岐起草假检讨，到统战部摸底，到外贸部探信；又到天津安定军心，打掩护安排退却。许素华叫毕鸣岐的亲信们散播说：毕主委没有什么大错；只不过有点骄傲自满，在北京检讨得很好，还有人向他学习哩！中央某首长还跟他握手，某首长也跟他点头；天津市副市长他还得当，小汽车也还在坐，请大家千万放心，毕主委真个不错。
    可是，毕鸣岐的反动言论在北京屡受批判，天津工商界又要他回去彻底交代。毕鸣岐回到天津，避重就轻地作了几次假检讨，他说他别无错误，就只是那四篇文章，出了一些小毛病。许多人揭露了他替章乃器吹嘘、拉人支持章乃器，以及他在天津的一些反动言行。米禄斋、赵天爵更揭露了毕鸣岐历来采取两面派的手法，一贯反共反社会主义的言行。现在列举一些如下：
    在“五反”运动的时候，关于他们隐匿敌产的事，米禄斋问交代不交代，毕鸣岐坚决不许交代，这事到如今也还是一桩悬案。在人前毕鸣岐说，“五反”教育意义很大；私下里毕鸣岐说，“五反”阻碍了工商界的积极性，对国家得不偿失。
    在抗美援朝的时候，毕鸣岐去朝鲜回来，公开说中朝战士英勇，背地里夸美国军队威风。
    肃反的时候他造谣惑众，说哪里有什么反革命！对胡风问题他歪曲说：是周扬给胡风扣帽子，是文艺界搞宗派斗争。
    国家实行粮食统购统销，他说这使农民吃不饱，更没有粮食作饲料，所以猪肉排队也难买到。城市人口的粮食供应要有定量，资本家和工人的食量不同，粮食定量当然也不同，毕鸣岐挑拨说这是不平等，说这跟沦陷时期日本人的配给制一个样。毕鸣岐说农业合作化不好，洪水冲走牲口和粮食，他说就因为合作化了没人管，要是单干就不会这样。
    党提出过渡时期的总路线，人们都说总路线是灯塔，毕鸣岐说：“灯塔我能看见，但我的钱却没有啦！”
    毕鸣岐举手通过宪法，回到家里却切齿咬牙，说共同纲领的一句话就是“五反”的根据，宪法比共同纲领更厉害。
    全行业公私合营前夕，米禄斋的妻子对毕鸣岐说：“你真行！买的东亚公司的股票也有利息可拿了。”毕回答说：“行什么，早晚不都得给了人家！”
    亚非国家在万隆举行会议的时候，国民党特务炸毁飞机谋害了一批和平战士，全国、全亚非和全世界爱好和平的人民莫不痛心疾首，毕鸣岐却为特务暴行喝采，说国民党特务真有办法！
    国民党特务在香港九龙制造暴乱，毕鸣岐说国民党真不简单，骚动可能发展到大陆上来，说不定还会变成一场大战。
    台湾是中国的领土，全国人民下决心一定要解放台湾，毕鸣岐却说台湾有美国舰队，说解放只能是空喊一阵。
