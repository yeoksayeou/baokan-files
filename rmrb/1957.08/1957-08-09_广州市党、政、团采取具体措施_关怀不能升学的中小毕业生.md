Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 8th: The list of admitted students to Guangzhou's secondary schools was released today. Leading organs have organized forces to go deep into the more than seven thousand middle and primary school graduates who were not admitted to conduct ideological education.

This year, Guangzhou's secondary schools admitted 23,483 students, an increase of more than 2,000 compared to last year. After the list was released today, Zhong Ming, Secretary of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Vice Mayor of Guangzhou, Zhang Qiguang, Deputy Director of the Guangzhou Municipal Education Bureau, and others, immediately went to various schools to guide school officials in conducting correct and patient education for students who were not admitted. Administrative leaders and heads of the Communist Youth League organizations in various schools also gave reports to students who were not admitted and held discussion meetings with them to help them correct their attitudes. Guangzhou No. 11 Middle School even mobilized all teachers to visit the homes of students who were not admitted to stabilize the emotions of students and parents.

The schools also conducted special work for those unadmitted students with more serious negative emotions. After the list was announced, the homeroom teachers and the Youth League cadres of the class personally escorted them home, comforted them, helped persuade parents to correctly treat the issue of their children not being admitted, and encouraged them to support their children's participation in labor.

For some orphans who are helpless and economically disadvantaged, and unadmitted students whose families are overseas or who have special family difficulties, the Guangzhou Municipal Education Bureau has decided to continue to allow them to enjoy student aid or be transferred to civil affairs departments for social relief. Relevant departments in Guangzhou are also actively arranging labor employment for this group of students.

    关怀不能升学的中小毕业生
    据新华社广州8日电　广州市中等学校录取生今天发榜，领导机关已组织力量深入未被录取的七千多中小学毕业生中进行思想教育。
    广州市各中等学校今年录取学生二万三千四百八十三名，比去年增加了二千多名。今天发榜后，中共广州市委书记、广州市副市长锺明，广州市教育局副局长张其光等，立刻亲往各学校，指导学校负责对没有录取的学生进行正确的和耐心的教育。各学校的行政领导人和共青团组织负责人也向未录取的学生作报告，和他们开座谈会，帮助他们端正态度。广州市第十一中学还动员了全体教师到未录取生的家里去，安定学生和家长的情绪。
    各学校对消极情绪比较严重的未录取学生，还进行了特别的工作，看榜后，班主任和班的共青团干部，亲自送他们回家，安慰他们，帮助说服家长正确地对待子女未被录取问题，鼓励他们支持子女参加劳动。
    对一些无依无靠、经济有困难的孤儿、和家在海外或家庭有特殊困难的未录取学生，广州市教育局决定，仍让他们享受助学金帮助，或转到民政部门给于社会救济。广州市有关部门也在积极地为这批学生安排劳动就业。
