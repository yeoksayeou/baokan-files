The True Situation of the Purge Movement in the Four Central Organs
    ——Refuting the Slanders of the Rightists Against the Purge Movement
    Xiao Ruoqin
    Rightist elements attempt to obliterate the achievements of the purge movement, exaggerating its shortcomings to a shocking degree. Such fabrications and exaggerations by the rightist elements cannot withstand the refutation of facts. Please see the true situation of the purge movement in the four central organs: the Ministry of Electric Power Industry, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the Ministry of Commerce, and the Ministry of Agriculture.
    Rightist elements say: "This purge movement led by the Party is a case of meddling in others' affairs," "Not a single genuine counter-revolutionary element was uncovered in this purge," and "This approach fails to distinguish between right and wrong, between the enemy and ourselves." What are the facts? Looking at these four organs, during the year-long purge movement, each organ cleared out approximately 1% of its total staff as counter-revolutionary elements and other bad elements. Among them, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry had 121, the Ministry of Electric Power Industry had 41, the Ministry of Commerce had 32, and the Ministry of Agriculture had 28. These included agents of the Kuomintang Military Intelligence Bureau, the Kuomintang Central Bureau of Investigation and Statistics, Japanese spies, and spies from other systems; key members of reactionary parties and groups; local bullies and bandits; traitors; renegades; and counter-revolutionary elements from reactionary military, government, police, and judicial systems. Among these counter-revolutionary elements, many were murderers stained with blood and resented by the people. Liu Ruqing, who was purged from the Jiaodian Company of the Ministry of Commerce, was such a counter-revolutionary element. During his tenure as the puppet county magistrate and garrison brigade commander of Zhecheng County, Henan Province, he repeatedly ordered the police to indiscriminately arrest working people and send them to Beijing, Datong, Mangshantou, and other places to build fortifications and mine coal for the Japanese invaders. In the winter of 1943 and the spring and autumn of 1944 alone, he arrested more than 300 people in four separate instances. Countless innocent people died after being arrested and subjected to humiliation. It is now known that at least eleven people died. Liu Ruqing also used various methods to plunder various materials for the Japanese invaders. Liu was praised by the Japanese invaders as a "model county magistrate." Wang Nianyuan, who was purged from the Textile Company of the Ministry of Commerce, was also a vicious counter-revolutionary element. During his tenure as the inspector of the police station under the Japanese puppet regime and the Kuomintang, he frequently arrested our revolutionary cadres and activists in the land reform movement. In October 1947, after landlords "accused" people of having been allocated property, Wang personally led the police to arrest the chairman of our peasants' salvation association, the vice-chairman of the women's salvation association, and twelve activists. After severely beating them, they were buried alive, shot, or imprisoned. Another example is Zhang Lin, who was purged from the Jiaodian Company of the Ministry of Commerce and was a renegade. In 1947, Zhang Lin colluded with Zhen Yuzhang, an agent of the Kuomintang Central Bureau of Investigation and Statistics, and introduced Zhen into the Party. Zhang Lin also betrayed the organization, causing serious damage to the Party's underground organization in Beijing, and 103 underground Party members and progressive elements close to the Party were arrested by the enemy. When the enemy tortured these Party members and progressive elements, Zhang also identified them in court. Some comrades secretly wrote and passed notes to encourage morale and uphold their integrity. Zhang then handed the notes over to the enemy. Zhang also gave speeches in prison to the progressive elements on the "atrocities of the Communist bandits," maliciously slandering the revolutionary movement. After liberation, Zhang infiltrated the revolutionary ranks, serving as the manager's secretary in the China Jiaodian Company, and also joined the Communist Youth League organization.
    Although many of these purged counter-revolutionary elements were counter-revolutionary elements from the past, they still harbored a deep-seated hatred for the Communist Party and socialism. They sought various opportunities to carry out sabotage, such as organizing anti-Party cliques, spreading reactionary remarks, provoking discord between the Party and the masses, creating work errors, and spreading rumors.
    Huang Liren, a counter-revolutionary element purged from the Beijing Hydroelectric Investigation and Design Institute, not only published reactionary articles in reactionary publications in Hong Kong after liberation but also organized an anti-Party clique within the organization, slandering and cursing the Party, the government, and all advanced things, touting the power of the atomic bomb, and praying for the arrival of a third world war. He said, "At that time, China will taste that flavor." He said he was "in the mainland, but his heart is in Taiwan." Another example is Ma Yanren, a counter-revolutionary element purged from the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, who infiltrated the Planning Department of the ministry and collected Party secrets in his work, such as the distribution, addresses, targets, product names, and uses of enterprises under the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the growth rate and cost reduction rate of the Ministry of Heavy Industry's Five-Year Plan, and the production processes and ore costs of some enterprises in the Northeast. These counter-revolutionary elements were like "time bombs" buried in our midst, ready to explode at any time. If we do not eliminate these people now, should we wait until they subvert socialism?
    Rightist elements also say: "The struggle against counter-revolutionaries used methods of forced confessions and believed them," and "They were catching shadows based on the wind, without any factual basis." They also say: "The purge movement created an atmosphere of suspicion, with everyone feeling insecure, greatly harming the enthusiasm of the masses." Let us look at the facts. Here, I will only introduce the investigation work in the purge, from which we can see that each organ adopted a serious, conscientious, and pragmatic attitude in the purge. Taking the Ministry of Electric Power Industry as an example, 500 cadres were sent out to conduct investigation work, and their footprints almost covered the entire country. In order to verify a fact, the comrades conducting the investigation went deep into remote areas and remote villages; in order to track down a clue, they traveled through several provinces, taking trains for days and nights; in order to verify a material, they rummaged through an entire room of archives. Xu Xiangxian of the Hydropower General Bureau of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry confessed during the purge that he had joined the Dianxi Guerrilla Force in 1944 and served as a lieutenant deputy group leader and personnel staff officer in the intelligence group. In order to clarify this matter, the bureau sent people to Yunnan to conduct an investigation, going to Qujing, Gejiu, Dali, Xiaguan, Longling, Tengchong, and other counties that the Dianxi Guerrilla Force had passed through, and finally found the commander, battalion commander, and detachment leader of the original Dianxi Guerrilla Force, clarifying the truth of the matter. In order to find out whether Zhang Buqian had participated in Yan Xishan's reactionary organization "Progress Society," the comrades conducting the investigation flipped through an entire room of archives and finally confirmed it.
    There are many such facts. This fully shows that the Party tried its best to investigate any clue of the objects being purged. However, the rightist elements attacked the Party again, saying that doing so was "not worth the candle" and "not worthwhile." What are the intentions of the rightist gentlemen? Isn't it very obvious?
    Let us look at the situation of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry. There was a cadre named Zhang Qilian in the Steel Industry Administration of this ministry. The organization originally had a document that he had participated in the preparatory committee of the Kuomintang Youth Party in Lingling County, Hunan Province, and it specified his age and native place. However, Zhang Qilian firmly denied it. After investigation, it was confirmed that the document actually belonged to the counter-revolutionary element Zhang Guoguang. When Zhang Guoguang applied for high school, he had fraudulently used Zhang Qilian's diploma. Therefore, when he was a member of the Youth Party Preparatory Committee, he continued to use Zhang Qilian's name, age, and native place. Thus, not only was a good person clarified, but also a genuine counter-revolutionary element was found.
    There are similar examples in the Ministry of Agriculture. For example, Mo Dingsen, the deputy chief agricultural technician of the Grain Bureau, was reported during the movement to be a "Kuomintang member"; others reported that when he was the director of the Zhejiang Agricultural Improvement Institute, he had persuaded our underground Party members to surrender; and others reported that he was a key member of the CC Clique and had close relations with the CC Clique leaders Zhu Jiahua, Zeng Yangfu, Jiang Jiamei, and others. Before the liberation of Hangzhou, he had held two "contingency meetings" with the puppet construction director to plan the retreat and deploy lurking agents. However, the ministry did not use this to deal with his problem but cautiously conducted an investigation, sending people to Hangzhou three times, conducting a check with more than 20 people, and consulting more than 20 years of archives stored in Nanjing, confirming that his history was clear.
    After the purge movement, did the political enthusiasm of the staff rise, or did they become depressed? Only facts can answer this question. Still taking the Ministry of Electric Power Industry as an example, through the purge, 1,400 people voluntarily confessed to the political history problems of varying degrees that they had concealed in the past, and more than 900 people reported counter-revolutionary and counter-revolutionary suspected problems. Among them, Liu Fengsheng, a comrade from the Beijing Electric Power Design Branch, whose father was a counter-revolutionary element who fled abroad after liberation for fear of punishment, came to Beijing to find Liu during the purge. Liu immediately reported to the public security organs and arrested him. Wen Guangji of the Beijing Electric Power Administration reported that his family was hiding short guns and bullets and assisted the public security organs in mobilizing his family to hand them over. In the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, 2,976 people voluntarily supplemented their political history problems during the purge, and 3,735 pieces of reporting materials were received. In addition, some people voluntarily handed over some weapons and ammunition during the purge movement. Many purge and investigation objects, after being reviewed, clarified their historical burdens that they had been carrying for many years and further approached the Party and improved their work enthusiasm. For example, Zhao Enxian of the Hydropower General Bureau had some historical sins and carried a burden for a long time. He was depressed all day long, and he didn't even shave his face or cut his hair. After clarifying the problem and giving him leniency, he was so excited that he cried bitterly. He said, "This has lifted a thousand pounds of burden." He was in good spirits, and his work efficiency doubled. Many such examples can be cited.
    Although some shortcomings also occurred in the purge movement of these several organs, they were by no means as described by the rightist elements, and they were only extremely minor compared with the above achievements. For example, the investigation work was insufficient in the early stage of the movement, and individual good people were wrongly struggled against; at one time, the shortcomings of crude struggle methods occurred in the movement. Furthermore, the ideological education for some comrades with political history problems was insufficient, or some problems were not handled properly, which affected these comrades from better exerting their enthusiasm. These were all corrected in a timely manner. The rightist elements deliberately rendered these shortcomings, and their intentions are very obvious. In addition, the phenomenon of counter-revolutionary elements slipping through the net also existed in the purge movement. For example, three counter-revolutionary elements who slipped through the net were found in the review of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry, including traitors who participated in the "no-man's land" with the Japanese puppets and counter-revolutionary elements who participated in the underground counter-revolutionary organization after liberation. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry was also the same. According to incomplete statistics from several units, after the end of the purge, four counter-revolutionary elements and one existing counter-revolutionary group case were found again.
    Are the achievements of the purge the main aspect, or are the shortcomings the main aspect? Let these facts draw a conclusion!

　　中央四个机关肃反运动的真实情况
    ——驳斥右派对肃反运动的污蔑
    肖若勤
    右派分子企图抹煞肃反运动的成绩，他们把肃反运动的缺点夸大到骇人听闻的程度。右派分子的这种捏造和夸大，是经不起事实的驳斥的。请看，下面是中央电力工业部、冶金工业部、商业部、农业部等四个机关肃反运动的真实情况。
    右派分子说：“这次党领导搞肃反运动是庸人自扰”“这次肃反没有真正打出来一个反革命分子”“这种做法是是非不分，敌我不分”事实怎样呢？从这四个机关来看，在历时一年的肃反运动中，每个机关都清查出来约占机关工作人员总数1％左右的反革命分子及其他坏分子。其中，冶金工业部一百二十一名，电力工业部四十一名，商业部三十二名，农业部二十八名。这里面有军统特务、中统特务、日本特务及其他系统的特务；有反动党团骨干；有恶霸土匪；有汉奸，有叛徒，有反动军政警宪中的反革命分子。在这些反革命分子中，有不少是血债累累、民愤极大的杀人凶犯。商业部交电公司清查出来的刘汝清就是这样的反革命分子。在他担任河南省柘城县日伪县长、警备大队长期间，曾多次指令警察乱抓劳动人民送往北京、大同、芒山头等地为日寇筑工事、挖煤。仅1943年冬、1944年春秋先后四次就抓了三百余人。这些无辜人民被抓后，不堪凌辱而死者不计其数，现已知道的就有十一人。刘汝清还用种种办法替日寇掠夺各种物资。刘曾被日寇誉为“模范县长”。商业部纺织品公司清查出来的王念元也是一个凶恶的反革命分子。在他担任日伪及国民党的警察所督察组长期间，经常逮捕我革命干部和土地改革中的积极分子。1947年10月地主“控告”被分了东西，王曾亲自带领警察，抓捕我农救会会长、妇救会副会长及积极分子十二人，毒打后，就活埋、枪毙或关押。又如商业部交电公司清查出来的张林，是个叛徒。1947年张林就勾结了中统局特务甄玉章，并把甄介绍入党。张林还出卖组织，党的北京地下组织因此遭受严重破坏，一百零三个地下党员和靠拢党的进步分子被敌人捕去。在敌人严刑烤打这些党员和进步分子时，张还当堂指认。有些同志密写传递纸条，鼓舞斗志，坚持气节，张便把纸条交给敌人。张还在狱中以“共匪暴行”为题给进步分子讲话，对革命运动进行恶毒的污蔑。解放后，张混进革命阵营，在中国交电公司担任经理秘书，并混进了青年团组织。
    清查出来的这些反革命分子中虽有不少是历史上的反革命分子，但是，他们对共产党、社会主义仍保持着刻骨的仇恨，他们寻找各种机会进行破坏，如：组织反党小集团，散布反动言论，挑拨党和群众的关系，制造工作差错，传播谣言……。
    北京水电勘察设计院清查出来的反革命分子黄立仁，解放后，除了在香港出版的反动刊物上发表反动文章外，还在机关内组织反动小集团，污蔑、咒骂党、政府和一切先进事物，吹嘘原子弹的威力，祈求第三次世界大战的到来。他说：“到那时候，中国就会吃到那滋味了，”他说他是“身在大陆，心在台湾”。又如冶金工业部清查出来的反革命分子马延訒，潜入该部计划司，在工作中搜集党的机密，如重工业部企业的分布、地址、目标、产品名称及用途，重工业部五年计划的上涨速度、成本降低率，东北一些企业的生产过程、矿石成本。这些反革命分子像“定时炸弹”一样地埋藏在我们中间，一遇时机，即行爆发。对于这些人，现在不去肃清他们，难道还要等到他们颠复了社会主义才算吗？
    右派分子还说：“斗争反革命是用了逼供信的方法”“捕风捉影，没有材料根据。”他们又说：“肃反运动形成草木皆兵，人人自危，大大伤害了群众的积极性。”让我们来看看事实。这里只介绍一下肃反中的调查工作的情况，从这里就可以看出各机关在肃反中是采取了严肃认真、实事求是的态度。以电力工业部为例，运动中曾派出五百名干部外出做调查工作，足迹几乎遍及全国。为了核对一个事实，调查的同志曾深入到边远地区和偏僻乡村；为了追搜一个线索，曾连跑几省，乘车几天几夜；为了证实一个材料，曾整整翻遍一屋子档案。电力工业部水电总局徐祥先在肃反中交代了他在1944年参加滇西游击队任谍报组中尉副组长及人事参谋的事，为了弄清这事，该局便派人到云南进行调查，先后到滇西游击队经过的曲靖、个旧、大理、下关、龙陵、腾冲等县，终于找到了原滇西游击队的司令、大队长、支队长等人，弄清了事情的真相。为了查清张步骞是否参加过阎锡山的反动组织“进步社”，调查的同志翻完了整整一屋子档案，最后终于证实。
    像这样的事实是不少的。这充分说明了党对于被清查的对象的任何一个线索都想尽一切办法追查清楚。但是右派分子却又攻击党说，这样做是“得不偿失”，“不值得”。右派先生们是何居心，难道不是十分明显吗？
    让我们再看看冶金工业部的情况吧。这个部的钢铁工业管理局有个干部叫张其廉，组织上原来掌握一份他参加湖南省零陵县青年党筹备委员的材料，而且写明了年龄和籍贯。但张其廉坚不承认，后经调查证实，原来这材料是反革命分子张国光的，张国光在投考高中时，曾冒用张其廉的文凭，因而，在当青年党筹备委员时，便继续沿用了张其廉的姓名、年龄和籍贯，至此不但弄清了好人，并且查获了真正的反革命分子。
    在农业部也有同样例子，如粮食局副总农业技师莫定森，在运动中，有人检举他是“国民党员”；又有人检举他在浙江农业改进所任所长时，劝过我地下党员自首；又有人检举他是CC骨干分子，与CC头子朱家骅、曾养甫、江家楣等人关系密切；杭州解放前夕，曾与伪建设厅长开过两次计划撤退和布置潜伏特务的“应变会”。但是，该部并未以此来处理他的问题，而是慎重地进行了调查，三次派人去杭州，通过二十多人进行了查对，并且调阅了南京保存的二十余年的档案材料，证实了他的历史是清楚的。
    肃反运动以后，工作人员政治热情高涨呢，还是意志消沉呢？也只有事实才能回答这个问题。仍以电力工业部为例，通过肃反有一千四百人自动坦白交代了过去隐瞒的大小不同的政治历史问题，有九百多人检举了反革命和反革命嫌疑问题。其中如北京电力设计分院刘凤笙同志，他父亲是个反革命分子，解放后畏罪潜逃在外，肃反中到北京来找刘，刘即报告公安机关逮捕归案。北京电业管理局温广济检举其家庭隐藏短枪和子弹，并且协助公安机关动员他家属交出。冶金工业部在肃反中有二千九百七十六人自动补充交代了自己的政治历史问题，收到三千七百三十五件检举材料。另外，在肃反运动中还有人自动交出一部分武器弹药。不少肃反清查对象经过审查被弄清了多年背着的历史包袱，也都进一步靠拢了党，提高了工作积极性。如水电总局赵恩諴有些历史罪恶，长期背包袱，整日意志消沉，平时连脸也不刮，头也不剃，弄清问题，给以宽大处理后，激动得痛哭了一场，他说：“这可丢下了千斤重担”精神愉快，工作效率提高了一倍。这样的例子还可以举出很多。
    在这几个机关的肃反运动中虽也产生了一些缺点，但这绝不如右派分子所形容的那样，它们比起上述成绩来只是极为次要的。如在运动初期调查工作不够，错斗了个别好人；运动中曾一度发生斗争方式粗暴的缺点，再如，对一些有政治历史问题的同志的思想教育不够，或一些问题处理不够妥当，影响了这些同志更好地发挥积极性，这些都及时进行了纠正。右派分子有意渲染这些缺点，其用心何在，是十分明显的。另外，在肃反运动中反革命分子漏网的现象也是存在的。如电力工业部在复查中就查出三个漏网的反革命分子，其中有参加日伪搞“无人区”的汉奸，也有解放后参加反革命地下组织的反革命分子。冶金工业部也是如此。据几个单位不完全统计，肃反结束以后，又查出反革命分子四起，现行反革命集团案一起。
    肃反成绩是主要的还是缺点是主要的？让这些事实来作结论吧！
