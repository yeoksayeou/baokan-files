Xinhua News Agency, 7th: To offset the production losses caused by flooding or drought in some farmlands in Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, and Fujian provinces, the majority of rural areas in these provinces are actively launching an over-production campaign to strive for a fall harvest.

In Henan Province, where the flooded area reached over 20 million mu, Party and government leading organs specifically studied the issue of launching an over-production campaign in non-disaster areas in late July. They demanded that non-disaster areas concentrate their efforts on eliminating weed infestation, applying additional fertilizer, and doing a good job in preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests, as well as drought and flood prevention. This campaign has now been launched successively in non-disaster areas throughout the province. In Anyang County, 315 out of 342 agricultural cooperatives have formulated over-production plans. More than 160,000 mu of land with missing seedlings and broken ridges have been replanted, and 35,000 mu of wasteland have been reclaimed. Other counties such as Tangyin and Queshan have also taken action.

The leading organs of Shandong Province have required that, in the over-production campaign, grain-producing areas throughout the province should strive to increase grain production by 10 jin per mu, cotton-producing areas should increase ginned cotton production by 5 jin, and each household should also store several jin of dried vegetables. In order to ensure the smooth development of this campaign, the Shandong Provincial People's Committee also held a telephone conference on August 2nd, attended by commissioners and agricultural section chiefs from various special districts. It instructed these areas to seize the current opportunity, try every means to tap all production potential, and requested each special district to immediately organize cadres to go deep into townships and cooperatives to assist in their work and lead the masses to quickly join the campaign. At the same time, they were to launch an over-production competition between cooperatives, teams, and groups.

After the leading organs of Anhui Province called for launching an over-production campaign in non-disaster areas, the three special districts of Bengbu, Lu'an, and Anqing have made plans to increase grain production by 300 million jin. This campaign has now been initially launched.

In order to make up for the fact that the total output of the spring and summer harvests in Fujian Province was lower than last year and to strive to complete this year's grain production plan, all four special districts in the province have studied and arranged work such as making full use of autumn idle land to expand crop planting and launching an autumn over-production campaign. Jinjiang Special District also convened a technical symposium attended by agricultural technicians and representatives of key agricultural cooperatives from six coastal counties, including Fuqing, Pingtan, Putian, and Hui'an, to study the technical issues of expanding crop planting in autumn idle fields and some specific measures in the work of preserving seedlings and ensuring harvests.

Huiyang Special District in Guangdong Province is also vigorously carrying out a late-season over-production campaign to compensate for the losses caused by early-season flooding.

Various regions in Hubei Province are carrying out a campaign to plant more and harvest more, striving for an all-round bumper harvest of various crops. In the three counties of Zhuxi, Fangxian, and Zhushan in Xiangyang Special District, where the campaign to plant more and harvest more has been carried out relatively well, a total of 190,000 mu have been intercropped, with an average increase of 100 jin of grain per household.

The counties of Shanxi Province are also actively implementing the instructions of the Provincial People's Committee on further taking measures to strive for a bumper agricultural harvest this year. Counties such as Anyi, Wuxiang, Gaoping, Quwo, and Xiyang in this province have formulated measures suitable to local conditions to ensure the completion of this year's production increase plan. At the same time, many responsible cadres of various counties have also gone deep into townships and cooperatives to conduct inspections and guidance.

While carrying out the over-production campaign in non-disaster areas, many disaster-stricken areas have also vigorously carried out drainage and replanting and production self-salvation campaigns. At present, the work of drainage and replanting in flood-stricken areas in Henan, Shandong, and Anhui provinces, and the work of drought resistance and seedling protection in drought-stricken areas in Hunan and Hebei provinces are also being carried out intensely.

    弥补受灾地区减产损失
    非灾区农民开展超额增产运动
    新华社7日讯　河南、山东、山西和福建等省的大部农村，正在积极开展超额增产运动，来弥补这些省一部分农田因受涝或受旱所造成的减产损失，并争取秋季丰收。
    涝灾面积达二千多万亩的河南省，党政领导机关在7月下旬就具体研究了在非灾区开展超额增产运动的问题，要求非灾区今后要集中力量消灭草荒、增施追肥和做好防治病虫害以及防旱防涝等工作。现在，这个运动已经在全省的非灾区先后展开。安阳县的三百四十二个农业社，已有三百一十五个社订出了超额增产计划。全县十六万多亩缺苗、断垅地已进行了补种并已开垦荒地三万五千亩，其他汤阴、确山等县也已经行动起来。
    山东省的领导机关要求全省非灾区在超额增产运动中，粮食产区每亩地要争取增产十斤粮食，棉产区要增产五斤籽棉，每户并且还要储备若干斤干菜。为了使这个运动得到顺利开展，山东省人民委员会在8月2日还召开了各专署专员、农业科长参加的电话会议，指示这些地区抓紧当前时机，想尽一切办法，挖掘一切增产潜力；并要求各专署立即组织干部深入乡、社帮助工作，领导群众迅速投入运动，同时发动社与社、队与队、组与组之间的超额增产竞赛。
    安徽省领导机关号召非灾区开展超额增产运动后，蚌埠、六安、安庆三个专区已作出计划，要求超额增产粮食三亿斤。现在，这一运动已初步开展起来。
    福建省为了弥补春收、夏收总产量不如去年，力争完成今年的粮食增产计划，目前全省已有四个专区研究布置了充分利用秋闲地扩种作物以及开展秋季超额增产运动等工作。晋江专区还召开了由福清、平潭、莆田、惠安等沿海六个县的农业技术干部和重点农业社代表参加的技术座谈会，研究了秋闲田扩种作物的技术问题和保种保收工作中一些具体措施。
    广东省的惠阳专区目前也正在大力开展晚造超额增产运动，以补早造受涝的损失。
    湖北省各地正在开展多种多收运动，争取各种作物全面大丰收。襄阳专区多种多收运动开展得较好的竹溪、房县、竹山三个县，共套种十九万亩，平均每户可多收粮食一百斤。
    山西省各县也在积极贯彻执行省人民委员会关于进一步采取措施，争取今年农业大丰收的指示，这个省的安邑、武乡、高平、曲沃和昔阳等县，已经因地制宜地制订了保证完成今年增产计划的措施。同时，各县的许多负责干部也已分别深入到乡社进行检查指导。
    在非灾区开展超额增产运动的同时，许多受灾地区也大力开展了排涝抢种和生产自救运动。目前，河南、山东、安徽等省受涝地区和湖南、河北干旱地区的排涝补种和抗旱保苗工作也正在紧张地进行。
