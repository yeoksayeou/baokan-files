　　(Our Dispatch) To meet the growing demands of industrial production and transportation in the Shenyang area, a modern hump-type train marshalling yard is under construction at the Sujiatun Railway Station in Shenyang.

In addition, some communication signals, electrical and other auxiliary equipment will be built. The entire project is expected to be completed in three years. (Wen Tianshen)
