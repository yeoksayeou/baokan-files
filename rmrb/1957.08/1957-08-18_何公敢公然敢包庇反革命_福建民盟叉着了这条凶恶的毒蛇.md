He Gonggan Dared to Publicly Shield Counter-Revolutionaries
Fujian Minmeng Impaled This Vicious Serpent

(Our dispatch) He Gonggan, a Fujian stronghold of the Zhang-Luo alliance, a rightist element who consistently opposed the Communist Party for decades, a member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League (Minmeng) and deputy chairman of the Fujian Provincial Committee, and director of the Fujian Provincial Department of Justice, has had his anti-Party and anti-people words and deeds thoroughly exposed at multiple meetings convened by the Minmeng provincial and municipal committees and the provincial Department of Justice. He Gonggan publicly spread the reactionary political proposition of so-called "democracy for all," opposing the people's democratic dictatorship, and viciously attempted to extend democracy to counter-revolutionaries and inmates undergoing reform through labor. As the director of the Justice Department, he believed that Wang Qinmei, a counter-revolutionary who killed revolutionary comrades, "only had backward words and deeds and should be released without charge." The Kuomintang secret agent Huang Guangyu also escaped to Hong Kong and then to Taiwan under his protection. Xie Xin, the mistress of Wang Tiaoxun, a counter-revolutionary element and spy ringleader who infiltrated Beijing Normal University, also came to his door in Beijing requesting He Gonggan to "rehabilitate" her.

He Gonggan also advocated developing capitalism and opposed socialist industrialization, saying that "Our country has little capital and a lack of talent, and we must use maximum profits to encourage capitalists to open factories." At the Minmeng National Work Conference, He Gonggan compared our construction of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway to Qin Shi Huang's construction of the Great Wall, portraying the construction of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway as a hardship imposed on the people.

He Gonggan has always boasted that he was a figure of "forty years of revolution," but according to Wu Congzheng, secretary-general of the Minmeng Provincial Committee, as early as twenty years ago, He Gonggan published articles in the "Xin Min Daily" in the Philippines opposing the Chinese Communist Party. In this article, He Gonggan shouted with gnashing teeth to "drive out" and "extinguish" the Communist Party.

In 1924, he founded the "Gu Jun Magazine" to promote fascism; in 1925, he organized the "Independent Youth Party" and openly clamored: "The Independent Party must prevent China's red movement and have the power of the Italian Squadristi and the spirit of the American Ku Klux Klan."

On the eve of liberation, he opposed the resolution passed by the Third Plenary Session of the Minmeng supporting the CCP's implementation of the land reform law. After liberation, He Gonggan had close contact with the secret agent Zheng Jianbai and Zhang Dongsun, and demanded that the Minmeng recognize the so-called Minmeng underground groups he had gathered together from some counter-revolutionary elements, attempting to preserve counter-revolutionary forces.

    何公敢公然敢包庇反革命
    福建民盟叉着了这条凶恶的毒蛇
    本报讯  章罗联盟的福建据点、数十年来一贯反共的右派分子、民盟中委兼福建省委副主委、福建省司法厅厅长何公敢的反党、反人民言行，在民盟省、市委和省司法厅分别召开的多次会议上，被彻底的揭露了。何公敢公然散布所谓“全民民主”的反对人民民主专政的反动政治主张，恶毒地企图把民主扩大到反革命、劳改犯身上去。作为一个司法厅长，他对一个杀死过革命同志的反革命分子王钦妹，竟认为“只有落后言行，应当无罪释放”；军统特务黄光裕也在他庇护之下，逃到香港转赴台湾；混进北京师大的反革命分子、特务头子王调勋的姘妇谢昕，在北京也找上门来要求何公敢为她“平反”。
    何公敢还主张发展资本主义，反对社会主义工业化，说什么“我国资金少，人材缺乏，要用最大利润鼓励资本家开办工厂”。在民盟全国工作会议上，何公敢将我们造鹰厦铁路和秦始皇造万里长城相比，把修建鹰厦铁路说成强加于人民的苦役。
    何公敢一向吹嘘自己是“革命四十年”的人物，但是，据民盟省委秘书长吴从征揭露，远在二十年前何公敢就在菲律宾出版的“新闽日报”发表反对中国共产党的文章。何公敢在这篇文章里咬牙切齿地狂喊“驱逐”、“扑灭”共产党。
    在1924年，他曾创办“孤军杂志”，宣扬法西斯主义；1925年组织“独立青年党”，并公开叫嚣：“独立党要防止中国的赤化运动，要有意大利棒喝团的威力和美国三K党的精神。”
    临解放时，他反对民盟三中全会通过拥护中共实施土地改革法的决议。解放后，何公敢通过特务郑建白和张东荪有过密切联系，并且要求民盟承认他所收罗的一些反革命分子组织所谓民盟地下小组，企图保存反革命势力。
