    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 7th August - The Sichuan Provincial Geological Bureau's exploration team is changing its past practice of only looking for large mines and ignoring small mines, and is actively providing local industries with mineral deposits suitable for small-scale mining.
    
    From the beginning of this year to the present, the Dadu River exploration team of this bureau has surveyed more than 50 mineral locations, and has successively provided local areas in Baoxing, Lushan, Yingjing and other counties with more than 10 zinc, copper, lead, nickel, iron and other mines. According to preliminary survey results, these small mineral deposits are simple to mine, require little investment, and yield quick results.
    
    Providing small mineral deposits for local industries is a new ancillary business that this bureau has developed this year after implementing the policy of combining large, medium, and small enterprises. Previously, the Sichuan Provincial Geological Bureau only explored mineral sources for the state that could be used to build large factories. This year, when they conducted a general survey in Baoxing County and found an antimony mine with reserves of more than 1,000 tons, they immediately notified the relevant local departments to find ways to exploit and utilize it.

    为地方工业找资源
    据新华社成都7日电　四川省地质局勘探队改变过去只找大矿不管小矿的作法，积极为地方工业提供适于小型开采的矿床。
    从今年开始到现在，这个局的大渡河勘探队察勘了矿点五十多处，先后在宝兴、芦山、荥经等县向地方提供出锌、铜、铅、镍、铁等矿共十多处。据初步勘测结果，开采这些小型矿床方法简便，投资少，收效快。
    为地方工业提供小型矿床，是这个局今年贯彻大、中、小企业相结合的方针以后，新开辟的一项附带业务。在此以前，四川省地质局只为国家勘探可以兴建大厂的矿源。他们今年在宝兴县普查到一蕴藏量有一千多吨的锑矿，就立即通知当地有关部门设法开采利用。
