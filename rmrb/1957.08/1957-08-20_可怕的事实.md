    Dreadful Facts
    In Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States, the increasing number of pregnant female students under the age of sixteen has become a serious problem in American education.
    According to a report by the director of the District's Bureau of Disease Control, from September 10, 1956, to April 10 of this year, a total of one hundred and ninety junior and high school female students under the age of sixteen applied for pregnancy certificates at the bureau's outpatient clinic in order to apply for leave from school. This number is ten times greater than that of the same period eight years ago. Among these pregnant girls, one was only ten years old, and seven were only eleven years old. The above is only a very incomplete statistic; as for the exact figures and the whereabouts of illegitimate children, the U.S. Bureau of Vital Statistics has no way of knowing.
    The main reasons for their pregnancies are difficult family lives, several families living together in one house, coupled with the influence of parents and social promiscuity.
    These pregnant female students receive no care or guarantee before or after childbirth. They have adverse psychological changes, and their schoolwork suffers. The number of cases of health damage due to induced abortions is increasing. Some people develop mental illnesses.

    可怕的事实
    在美国的首都华盛顿市哥伦比亚特别区，十六岁以下的女学生怀孕人数日益增多，这种伤风败俗的事情已经成为美国教育界一个严重的问题。
    根据该区疾病管理局局长的报告，自1956年9月10日起至今年4月10日止，在该局门诊部请领怀孕证明书以便申请停学的十六岁以下的中、小学女学生计达一百九十名。这个数目比八年前同时期增加了十倍。在这些怀孕的女孩子中，有一名年仅十岁，有七名年仅十一岁。以上仅为极不完全的统计，至于确实的数字与私生子的下落，美国出生统计局也没有办法掌握。
    她们怀孕的原因，主要是家庭生活困难，好几家同住在一所房子里，加上父母和社会上性生活混乱的影响。
    这些怀孕的女学生，在产前产后都没有任何照顾和保证。她们心理上发生了不良的变化，功课都学得不好。因为人工堕胎而损害了健康的情形越来越多。有的人得了神经病。　　　　　　（洪）
