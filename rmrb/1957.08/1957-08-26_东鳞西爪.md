　　Glimpses Here and There
    Shanghai Telephone to Adopt Six-Digit Numbers
    Starting September 1st, Shanghai's local telephone numbers will switch to six-digit numbers. This is a major technical reform of Shanghai's local telephone network and a new technological development in China's local telephone service.
    In the past, Shanghai had two parallel identical number systems in the urban and suburban areas, with three different dialing methods, and the first digit numbers were insufficient. After the telephone network is reconstructed with six-digit numbers, these problems will all be resolved, and the number of telephones that can be installed can also be greatly increased.

    A Hero of Safe Driving on Mountain Roads
    Yunnan's highways are known for their difficulty due to the many mountains and steep slopes. However, the Zhanyi Transportation General Station of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Transportation's Transportation Bureau already has thirty-two drivers who have safely driven more than 200,000 kilometers. Among them, Xiang Wenlin has already safely driven more than 244,000 kilometers. (Shui Mu)
    Unobstructed Navigation on the Middle and Lower Reaches of the Bailong River
    The improvement project of the middle and lower reaches of the Bailong River, one of Gansu Province's largest rivers, has recently been completed and has begun to be navigable. In the past, the middle and lower reaches of this river had many reefs and dangerous shoals, and ships or rafts had never been able to pass through smoothly in history. Since October last year, the Gansu Provincial Department of Transportation, in conjunction with relevant departments, has improved this waterway. From then on, hundreds of miles of the river channel in the middle and lower reaches of the Bailong River are unobstructed, and small motorboats carrying 100 to 200 tons can pass.

    上海电话改用六位号码
    上海的市内电话从9月1日起将改用六位号码。这是上海市内电话网的一项重大技术改革，也是我国市内电话事业技术上的一个新发展。
    过去，上海的电话在市区，郊区有两个平行的相同号码系统，有三种不同的拨号方法，而且首位号码不足。电话网改建六位号码以后，这些问题都得到解决，设置电话的数量也可大大增加。（周修庆）
    山路上安全驾驶的英雄
    云南的公路山多坡陡，以艰险著称。但是，云南省交通厅运输局沾益运输总站已经有三十二名驾驶员安全行驶了二十万公里以上。其中，向文林已经安全行驶了二十四万四千多公里。　（水木）
    白龙江中下游航行无阻
　　甘肃省最大的河流之一——白龙江中下游的整治工程，已在最近完成，并已开始通航。过去这条河流的中下游地区，礁石险滩很多，有史以来从未畅通过船只或皮筏。从去年10月起，甘肃省交通厅联合有关部门整治了这条航道。从此白龙江中下游数百里的河道畅通无阻，并可通行载重一、二百吨的小火轮。
