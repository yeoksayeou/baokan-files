Xinhua News Agency, Zhaoyuan, August 30th: The flood is still seriously threatening the San Zhao area—Zhaoyuan, Zhaodong, and Zhaozhou. This area is the gateway for the Songhua River flood peak to enter Heilongjiang Province. Moreover, the Nen River and the Second Songhua River converge in Zhaoyuan County before entering the main stream of the Songhua River. Therefore, Zhaoyuan County bears the brunt of the flood threat. Currently, a flood prevention army of 110,000 farmers and cadres in the San Zhao area is working intensely on the dikes of the Nen River and the Second Songhua River to fight the flood. In the past two days, the 26th and 27th, this flood prevention army has overcome the flood peaks arriving from the Nen River and the Second Songhua River. Now, this flood prevention army is raising and thickening the dikes and rushing to repair dangerous sections to block the upcoming flood peak once again.

Wang Yilun, Secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Zhao Qufei, Deputy Governor, who are directing the flood prevention efforts in Zhaoyuan, told Xinhua reporters: "The San Zhao area is an important grain-producing area in Heilongjiang Province. The safety of Zhaoyuan County is related to the safety of the lives and property of millions of people in the San Zhao area, and the harvest of hundreds of thousands of hectares of farmland. It even affects the supply of non-staple foods and commercial grain to Harbin. Therefore, the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party attaches great importance to the flood prevention work in the San Zhao area."

At present, a large amount of manpower and flood prevention materials allocated uniformly by the Heilongjiang Provincial Flood Control Headquarters are being transported to the San Zhao area every day by water, road, and rail. As of the 29th, nearly 70,000 migrant workers mobilized from Suihua, Zhaozhou, Shangzhi, and Hailun counties had begun to participate in various dike repair and emergency rescue work at the Zhaoyuan County flood prevention site. On the 28th, nearly 70,000 people went to work on the dikes. Part of the flood prevention materials, including straw bags, wooden poles, and grain, have also been transported, and the rest are being rushed to the area. The flood prevention struggle in the Zhaoyuan area has also received assistance from Soviet friends. The CT-504 and 507 cargo ships of the Soviet Heilongjiang Shipping Administration, which came to Heilongjiang Province to support flood prevention, helped transport 702 tons of grain, 60,000 straw bags, and thousands of mats from Harbin on the 28th.

    黑龙江三肇地区
　　干部群众积极和洪水搏斗
    新华社肇源30日电　洪水还严重威胁着三肇地区——肇源、肇东和肇州。这个地区是松花江洪峰进入黑龙江省的门户，而嫩江和第二松花江又是在肇源县境内汇合进入松花江干流，所以肇源县受洪水威胁是首当其冲。现在三肇地区的一支由十一万名农民和干部组织的防汛大军，正在嫩江和第二松花江的大堤上紧张地和洪水搏斗。这些防汛大军在26和27日两天中，已战胜了嫩江和第二松花江到来的洪峰。现在，这支防汛大军正在加高培厚堤坝、抢修险工，以阻挡即将到来的又一次洪峰。
    正在肇源指挥防汛斗争的中共黑龙江省委书记王一伦、副省长赵去非对新华社记者说：“三肇地区是黑龙江省一个重要产粮区。肇源县是否安全，关系着三肇地区千百万人民生命财产的安全，和数十万公顷农田的收成。甚至影响到哈尔滨市的副食品和商品粮的供应。因此，中共黑龙江省委对三肇地区的防汛工作异常重视。”
    目前，黑龙江省防汛指挥部统一调拨来的大批人力和防汛器材，每天都从水路、公路和铁路运往三肇地区，到29日止，仅肇源县防汛工地，由绥化、肇州、尚志和海伦等县动员来的近七万民工，已经开始参加修堤抢险的各种工作。28日上堤工作的就达近七万人之多，防汛器材中的草包、木杆以及粮食等，也已运到一部分，其它正在赶运。肇源地区的防汛斗争，还得到了苏联友人的帮助。前来黑龙江省支援防汛的苏联黑龙江航运管理局的CT五○四和五○七两只货船，在28日帮助从哈尔滨运来了七百零二吨粮食、六万条草包和数千张席子。
