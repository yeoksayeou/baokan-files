Debate on Two Grain Accounts
Dan Xiongfei Zou Guangjing
Recently, in the Changchong Cooperative of Sanyang Township, Pingjiang County, Hunan Province, two groups of people started a major debate based on two different grain accounts.

The first and third production teams of this cooperative have different natural conditions and living standards, and are divided into "rich villages" and "poor villages". The first team has 35 households, including 28 middle and well-to-do middle peasants. Their lives have always been better, and they are called "rich villages"; the third team has 42 households, including 35 poor peasants. Their lives were particularly difficult before liberation. Although their lives have improved year by year after liberation, they still have not caught up with the first team, so they are called "poor villages". These two villages (teams) have disputes on many issues. For example: during the agricultural cooperation, the "rich village" accused the "poor village" of having too few farm tools and cattle and was unwilling to run a cooperative together; in production, the "poor village" accused the "rich village" of starting work late, finishing early, and having too low efficiency; when paying national grain, the "poor village" wanted to be fast, and the "rich village" wanted to be slow; when selling surplus grain, the "rich village" wanted to sell less, and the "poor village" wanted to sell more; and so on. Recently, they had a dispute over the grain retention standard.

In early August, the work team publicized that the state would resolutely implement the "three fixings" and reasonably control sales of grain this year. Some people resolutely agreed with the state's policy, while others resolutely opposed it. There was much discussion and a great stir.

At this time, fourteen wealthy households in the "rich village," led by Zheng Wancheng, spent three days calculating a grain consumption account, which they sent to the work team and promoted among cooperative cadres and the masses. The account was as follows:
Year 	Households 	Population 	Total Grain Consumption (jin) 	Average per person (jin)
1948 	14 	49 	32,929 	672
1951 	14 	50 	35,000 	700
1954 	14 	48 	30,960 	645
1956 	14 	51 	28,407 	557

When promoting this account, they seized on two "central contents": one was "life has declined year by year since liberation, especially after cooperation it has become even harder"; and the other was "520 jin of grain is simply not enough to eat; our ancestors have never had enough with 520 jin." They also said that in the past year or two, they nominally retained grain according to the "three fixings" standard, but they set up many "ambushes" and actually consumed more grain than the retention standard. Therefore, some people shouted, "This year, we must retain at least 700 jin to have enough to eat."

This account received a response from some people. Some people, although disagreeing with retaining 700 jin, proposed different standards such as 550 jin, 600 jin, and 650 jin. This atmosphere prevailed for a time. Of the 330,000 jin of requisitioned grain that the cooperative should have delivered, they were unwilling to deliver any more after delivering 120,000 jin, and even put forward the requirement of "only handing over public grain, not selling surplus grain, and even not selling overproduction grain."

Why did some people want to retain so much grain? Was 520 jin of grain enough? The comrades of the work team went to the third team to discuss with the poor peasants. First, they held a forum for 22 poor peasant households, told everyone about the "rich village"'s grain consumption account, and asked everyone to express their opinions. The poor peasant Li Cuoqi calculated his own grain consumption last year. His family of six had a total of 3,047 jin of grain for rations and labor rewards. About 60 jin was eaten by a litter of piglets and chickens and ducks, and about 80 jin was eaten by guests. The whole family actually only ate about 2,900 jin, an average of 483 jin per person; and there was no shortage of grain until the new grain came in. Then, Huang Bosong, Cai Mengzhou, and more than a dozen other households calculated their accounts, and their per capita grain consumption had never exceeded 500 jin. Huang Bosong recalled that before liberation, when they relied on tenant farming for food, each person only received less than 300 jin of grain per year. Everyone felt that the "rich village"'s account was wrong. So someone suggested: Let's also calculate a few years' worth of accounts and compare them with theirs, let everyone judge, and see who is right and who is wrong. Their grain consumption account was as follows:

Year 	Households 	Population 	Total Actual Grain Consumption (jin) 	Average per person (jin)
1948 	22 	91 	29570 	325
1951 	22 	94 	42300 	459
1954 	22 	103 	50368 	489
1956 	22 	106 	53210 	502

They also raised two "central issues": one was that life was very hard before liberation, suffering from cold and hunger, but it had improved year by year after liberation, and now they didn't have to worry about food and clothing; the other was "always think of days without when you have days with," and as long as they saved grain, 520 jin was enough.

Two different groups of people calculated two different accounts, which were diametrically opposed, and launched a debate on who was right and who was wrong throughout the cooperative.

The rhetoric from the "rich households" was, "The poor peasants are fools, they don't eat good food, they eat seedlings (the main coarse grains locally)."

The "poor households" retorted: "Step by step up the stairs, you can't reach the sky in one step. While living the current life of plenty, you must also think about the days of hunger in the past."

The "rich households" said: "We have less grain than in the past, and we can't eat enough to be satisfied."

The "poor households" retorted: "You ate too much in the past, causing many people to go hungry; now most people have enough to eat, and in two or three years everyone will be able to eat as much grain as you did in the past. Now that we are eating enough, why aren't you eating enough?"

The "rich households" said: "We grow our own grain, why can't we eat more?"

The "poor households" replied: "In the past, we also grew our own grain, but we only ate 20-30%; now we eat 70-80%, isn't that reasonable? Besides, who is the state requisitioning grain for?"

The "rich households" had no words to say.

Huang Bosong, a poor peasant who was familiar with the family situation of well-to-do middle peasant Chen Dusheng, revealed the secrets of Chen's family: last year, his family used 300 jin of grain to feed pigs, 170 jin to feed chickens and ducks, and 210 jin to make fruit rice noodles. His family only eats rice and doesn't eat coarse grains, but often asks the government to supplement the sales of grain. Faced with the facts, Chen Dusheng bowed his head and admitted defeat. According to the exposure of more than 20 cooperative members, these 14 "rich households" wasted more than 7,100 jin of grain last year alone in their grain consumption account.

Now, the "rich village"'s grain consumption account has been denied by all the cooperative members; the "poor village"'s grain consumption account is engraved in everyone's hearts. Finally, they unanimously passed a resolution to "resolutely complete the 330,000 jin requisition task and sell 50,000 jin of overproduction grain to the state," ending the debate.

　　两笔粮食账的论战
　　单雄飞　邹光敬
    最近，在湖南平江县三阳乡的长冲社，两派人物以两笔不同的粮食账，开展了一场大论战。
    这个社的第一和第三两个生产队，自然条件和生活水平不同，有
  “富村”“穷村”之分。第一队三十五户中，有二十八户中农和富裕中农，生活一贯较好，称为“富村”；第三队四十二户中，有三十五户是贫农，解放前生活特别苦，解放后生活虽然逐年改善，但还是没赶上第一队，所以叫做“穷村”。这两个村（队），在很多问题上有争执。比如：在农业合作化时，“富村”指责“穷村”的农具耕牛少，不愿同办一个社；在生产中，“穷村”指责“富村”出工迟、收工早、工效太低；在交纳国家公粮时，“穷村”要快，“富村”要慢；在出售余粮时“富村”要少，“穷村”要多；等等。最近，他们在粮食留量标准上又发生了争执。
    8月初，工作组宣传今年国家将坚决执行“三定”和合理控制销量的粮食政策。对国家的政策，有的坚决赞成，有的坚决反对。议论纷纷，轰动一时。
    就在这时候，“富村”有以郑晚成为首的十四户富裕户，用三天工夫算出来的一笔用粮账，送给工作组，并在社干部和群众中间宣传。账是这样的：
  年度　户数　人口　全年共用粮（斤）　每人平均量（斤）
  1948　14　   49　      32，929　        672
  1951　14　   50　      35，000　        700
  1954　14　   48　      30，960　        645
  1956　14　   51　      28，407　        557
    他们在宣传这笔账的时候，抓住了两个“中心内容”：一是“解放后生活逐年下降了，特别在合作化后更苦了”；二是“五百二十斤留粮硬是不够吃；祖宗几代以来，五百二十斤从没吃够了的”。还说，去年前年名义上按“三定”标准留粮，但打了很多“埋伏”，实际用粮比留粮标准多。因此有人叫嚷，“今年起码要留七百斤才够吃”。
    这笔账得到了一部分人的呼应。有人虽不同意留七百斤，但提出了留五百五十斤、六百斤、六百五十斤等不同的标准。这种空气一时占了上风。社内应送交的三十三万斤征购粮，在送了十二万斤以后，不愿再送了，甚至提出了“只交公粮，不卖余粮，更不卖超产粮”的要求。
    为什么有人要留这样多口粮？究竟留粮五百二十斤够不够？工作组的同志到第三队找贫农商量。首先召开了二十二户贫农座谈会，把“富村”的用粮账告诉大家，要大家发表意见。贫农李撮奇将自己去年用粮数算了一算。他家六个人全年口粮和劳动奖励粮共分了三千零四十七斤。一窝小猪和鸡、鸭大概吃掉六十来斤，人来客去吃了八十来斤，全家实际只吃二千九百斤左右，每人平均四百八十三斤；吃到接新谷，并不少粮。接着，黄柏松、蔡梦周等十多户都算了账，每人用粮从来没有超过五百斤。黄柏松回忆，解放前靠佃田吃饭的时候，每人每年还合不到三百斤粮，大家都感到“富村”的账不对头。于是有人提议：我们也算几年的账同他们比一比，让大家来鉴定，看看谁是谁非。他们的用粮账是这样的：
    年度　户数　人口　全年实用粮（斤）　每人平均量（斤）
    1948 　22　 91     　29570　            325
    1951 　22　 94　     42300　            459
    1954　 22　 103　    50368　            489
    1956　 22　 106　    53210　            502
    他们也提出了两个“中心问题”：一是解放前生活很苦，挨冻挨饿，解放后逐年提高，现在吃的穿的不愁了；二是“常将有日思无日”，只要节约用粮，五百二十斤足够了。
    两种不同的人算出了两笔不同的账，针锋相对，在全社范围内开展了谁是谁非的辩论。
    来自“富户”的言论是，“贫农是傻瓜，吃饭不好，要吃苗（当地的主要杂粮）”。
    “穷户”反驳说：“脚踏楼梯步步高，要一步登天是不行的，过现在的饱日子，也要想想过去的饿日子。”
    “富户”说：“我们的粮食比过去少了，硬是吃不过瘾。”
    “穷户”反驳：“你们过去吃多了，叫很多人挨饿；现在绝大多数的人够吃了，再过两三年大家都可以吃你们过去那么多粮食了。现在我们吃得饱，你们为什么会不够吃呢？”
    “富户”说：“我们自己种的粮食，为什么不可以多吃点呢？”
    “穷户”的答复是：“过去也是我们自己种的粮食，可是自己只吃二三成；现在自己吃了七、八成，这不合理吗？再说，国家征购粮食，又是为了谁呢？”
    “富户”没有话说了。
    熟悉富裕中农陈督生家庭情况的贫农黄柏松揭穿了陈家的秘密：去年他家用三百斤粮食喂猪，一百七十斤喂鸡鸭，还用二百一十斤做果子米面。他家只吃大米不吃杂粮，却经常要求政府补销粮食。在事实面前，陈督生低头认输了。据二十多户社员揭发，原来这十四户“富户”的用粮账中，去年一年就浪费了七千一百多斤粮食。
    现在，“富村”的用粮账被全体社员否认了；“穷村”的用粮账，铭刻大家心间。最后，一致通过“坚决完成三十三万斤征购任务，并多卖五万斤超产粮给国家”的决议，结束了这场论战。
