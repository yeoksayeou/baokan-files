(Special dispatch from our newspaper's special correspondent, Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, August 14) Recently, grain black market activities in various parts of Shanxi Province have been rampant, seriously undermining the current grain unified purchase and sales system and the consolidation of agricultural cooperatives. According to the analysis made at the recent meeting of grain bureau chiefs of various special districts and key counties convened by the Shanxi Provincial Grain Bureau, the main sources of grain for the black market are the following six aspects: First, there are shortcomings in the grain distribution of agricultural cooperatives. In the past, the method of distributing grain equally per capita was used. Children and those with weak labor power could not finish eating their grain, and in addition to some waste, a large amount flowed into the black market. Second, some agricultural cooperatives, after distributing basic rations equally per capita, also took care of the members who worked well with surplus grain. They could not finish eating their grain, so they sold it to the black market at high prices. Third, the increased production was not accompanied by increased purchase, and even if some was purchased, there was still a large amount of surplus grain. Fourth, individual farmers did not hand in public grain or sell surplus grain. These individual households had a lot of surplus grain, and it all flowed into the "free market." Fifth, some people used unreasonable methods to defraud the state's unified sales grain, and then bought it cheaply and sold it dearly, or processed and made non-staple food products for speculation and profit. Sixth, agricultural cooperatives accumulated too much reserve grain. In the Datong area, agricultural cooperatives had at least 10,000 jin, and some had as much as 50,000 to 60,000 jin. Agricultural cooperatives generally distributed this surplus grain to members in the spring and autumn, causing members to have a large amount of grain added on top of their existing rations, creating a material basis for it to flow into the black market.

According to investigation materials from the Xin County area, black market grain prices are generally one to three times higher than market prices, and some are as high as seven to eight times. Grain dealers in the Datong area formed groups to purchase naked oats in Fengzhen, Inner Mongolia, and then sell them in various parts of northern Shanxi, making a profit of one to two times. Due to the rampant activities of the black market and the destruction of grain prices, Xin County and Anze County have failed to complete the unified purchase task every year and have over-sold state grain every month since the implementation of unified purchase and sales. In areas where black market activities are prevalent, many agricultural cooperative members are also enticed to go out to engage in individual side businesses and engage in grain speculation, the labor discipline within the cooperatives is lax, and the organization is not consolidated.

Investigation materials prove that it is not grain-deficient households who buy black market grain at high prices, but grain speculators, wealthy farmers in some special product areas, family members of workers and cadres who are not satisfied with the rations distributed in the countryside, as well as urban residents and other non-agricultural populations. Only a very small number of grain-deficient households buy black market grain as a temporary emergency measure due to shortcomings in the local grain unified sales supply.

In order to completely and thoroughly eradicate the grain black market and ensure unified purchase and sales and stable grain prices, various parts of Shanxi Province have begun to strengthen grain market management and eliminate the grain black market. First of all, in conjunction with the great debate on grain issues and the rectification of grain supply and marketing work, all localities are educating cadres and peasants about the harm of the grain black market to socialism, criticizing the right-leaning and negative emotions and practices of leading cadres in grain market management, criticizing the capitalist ideas of peasants who seek personal gain and engage in grain speculation that harms national interests. Secondly, the grain distribution and supply system is improved to block the aforementioned six channels and loopholes for grain to flow into the black market, and the policy of grain "three fixings," "quantitative determination per capita," and increased production and increased purchase is thoroughly implemented. At the same time, the supply of grain-deficient households is properly arranged, and efforts are made to adjust grain varieties to improve people's lives. Various localities have also begun to mobilize the broad masses and grain speculators to wage a resolute struggle. Grain speculation cases are handled in a timely manner, and grain speculators who violate the national economy and people's livelihood and endanger the cause of socialist construction are severely punished.

    彻底消灭粮食黑市
    山西着手加强粮食市场管理
    本报特约新华社太原14日电  山西各地最近粮食黑市活动猖獗，对目前粮食统购统销的进行和农业合作社的巩固起着严重的破坏作用。根据最近山西省粮食厅召开的各专区和重点县粮食局长会议上的分析，黑市粮食来源最主要的有下列六方面：第一是农业社粮食分配上有缺点。过去粮食沿用按人平均分配的办法，小孩多劳动弱的人粮食吃不完，除了浪费一些外，大量流入黑市。第二是有些农业社在平均按人分配基本口粮以后，又把多余的粮食照顾劳动好的社员，他们粮食吃不完，就以高价卖给黑市。第三是增产部分没有增购，有的增购了也还有大批余粮。第四是个体农户不缴公粮不卖余粮。这些单干户余粮很多，而且都流入“自由市场”。第五是某些人以无理取闹的方法，骗取国家统销粮，然后贱买贵卖，或加工制作副食品，投机牟利。第六是农业社积存机动粮过多。大同地区农业社少的一万斤以上，多的达到五六万斤。农业社大都在春秋两季把这些余粮分给社员，使社员在已有口粮的底子上，平空增加大批粮食，造成流入黑市的物质基础。
    根据忻县地区调查材料，黑市粮价一般都比市价高一到三倍，有的高到七八倍。大同地区粮贩成群合伙到内蒙古丰镇购买莜麦，然后到雁北各地出售，从中获利一倍到两倍。由于黑市的猖獗活动和粮价遭到破坏，忻县、安泽两县从实行统购统销以来，年年完不成统购任务，月月多销国家粮食。在黑市活动普遍的地方，还引诱许多农业社社员出外搞个人副业和从事粮食投机，社内劳动纪律松懈，组织不巩固。
    调查材料证明：出高价买黑市粮食的并不是缺粮户，而是粮食投机商贩，一些特产区的富裕农民，对农村分配的口粮不满足的工人和干部家属，以及城镇市民和其他非农业人口。只有极少数是由于当地粮食统销供应存在缺点，购买黑市粮食作临时救急用的缺粮户。
    为了全面彻底根绝粮食黑市，保证统购统销和粮价稳定。山西各地已在着手加强粮食市场管理，消灭粮食黑市。各地首先结合粮食问题大辩论和粮食供销整顿工作，向干部和农民进行粮食黑市对社会主义的危害性的教育，批判领导干部对粮食市场管理上的右倾消极情绪和作法，批判农民贪图个人利益从事危害国家利益的粮食投机活动和滋长着的资本主义思想。其次，从粮食分配和供应制度上加以改进，堵塞前述六个粮食流入黑市的孔道和漏洞，彻底执行粮食“三定”、“以人定量”和增产增购的政策。同时妥善作好缺粮户的供应和为改善人民生活而设法调剂粮食品种的工作。各地还着手发动广大群众和粮食投机者作坚决斗争。及时处理粮食投机案件，严厉打击违犯国计民生的和危害社会主义建设事业的粮食投机犯。
