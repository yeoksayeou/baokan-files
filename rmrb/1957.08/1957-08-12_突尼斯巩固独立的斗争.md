    Tunisia's Struggle to Consolidate Independence
    Yang Chongguang
    On July 25th, the Tunisian Constituent Assembly unanimously passed a resolution to depose the King of Tunisia and declare Tunisia a republic, thus ending the rule of the Hussein dynasty in Tunisia since 1705. This is a major event in Tunisian history following the declaration of independence last March. The establishment of the Tunisian Republic has been welcomed by the Tunisian people and the people of all countries. The Chinese government officially decided to recognize the Tunisian Republic on August 2nd.
    The Tunisian people, who gained independence after more than seventy years of arduous struggle, have taken a series of reform measures in the past year or so to consolidate national independence. These efforts have achieved preliminary success.
    The new national institutions of Tunisia have been established, and the Bourguiba government, formed the day after the declaration of independence, has taken control of the state power. A Tunisian army was established, and a national security force was also established to replace the former French gendarmerie. It abolished the administrative system of the French colonial rule and established fourteen new provinces with Tunisians as governors. At the same time, Tunisia carried out judicial reforms, implemented an electoral law in which women also have the right to vote, and abolished polygamy. At the beginning of this year, the representative of the reactionary landlord class, Yousef, was sentenced to death in absentia, greatly weakening the feudal forces. The government also promulgated laws abolishing royal privileges and confiscating illegally acquired royal property. All this prepared the conditions for the deposition of the king and the establishment of a republic.
    In its foreign policy, the Tunisian government follows the principles of the Bandung Conference, sending diplomatic envoys to several countries and participating in the United Nations, and has begun to play its role on the international political stage.
    These achievements encourage the Tunisian people to fight for further consolidation of independence. However, today, both politically and economically, the Tunisian people still face serious tasks, and there are still many difficulties on the road to consolidate independence.
    The Tunisian people have not forgotten that about 50,000 French troops are still stationed on their soil. Bourguiba once said: "We must not forget that there are still many obstacles in our path, and the most important of these is the presence of foreign troops on Tunisian territory." The French troops not only seriously endanger Tunisia's national independence and sovereignty, but also use Tunisian territory as an important base for attacking the Algerian National Liberation Army. In May and June of this year, French troops and Tunisian soldiers engaged in several large-scale armed conflicts. Residents of many Tunisian cities held large-scale demonstrations on June 9th to protest the continued stationing of French troops in Tunisian territory and demand the immediate withdrawal of French troops from Tunisia. The Tunisian government has also repeatedly sent notes to the French government, demanding a swift resolution of the relevant issues between the two countries, including the withdrawal of French troops.
    Seventy-five years of brutal rule by French colonialists has made Tunisia an economically backward agricultural country with a very weak industrial base. Tunisia has abundant natural resources, but these resources have fallen into the hands of foreign imperialists. Minerals, transportation, gas, water and electricity, manufacturing, and commerce are basically controlled by the French. According to statistics, out of the 311 enterprises with more than 50 workers, only 33 belong to Tunisians. Agriculture is no exception; the vast majority of the most fertile land is owned by large colonial development companies. French monopoly capital is doing its best to prevent political and economic reforms in Tunisia. French investment in Tunisia is being withdrawn in large quantities, and French credit and insurance businesses have stopped opening to Tunisia.
    Another evil consequence left over from colonial rule is the problem of unemployment. The economic conditions of workers, craftsmen, small farmers, and urban residents are mostly difficult. Nearly half of the men in the labor force (about 400,000) have no fixed income and are unemployed or semi-employed. Even workers who are employed have unstable lives. Therefore, Tunisian workers have launched strikes demanding higher wages, improved living conditions, and working conditions. At the request of agricultural workers, the government promulgated the Agricultural Labor Law in April 1956, but agricultural capitalists resisted this law and continued to threaten workers with dismissal. The government originally took some measures for the nationalization of railways, but it was opposed by capitalists, and it seems that the railway nationalization bill will be shelved.
    The Tunisian government has tried to seek foreign aid to ease some of the economic difficulties it faces domestically. The French government had agreed to give Tunisia a loan of 12.1 billion francs, but the French government suddenly announced on April 3rd that it would stop the loan for various reasons. In response to this decision by France, the Tunisian government decided on May 31st to take a series of new measures, including the establishment of its own tariff rates (in the past, Tunisia had a customs union with France) and the transfer of foreign exchange to the control of the Tunisian government (in the past, it was operated by France).
    The United States has long coveted Tunisia, a "strategically important region of the first order." As early as 1950, the United States obtained the right to establish military bases in Tunisia. After Tunisia declared independence, the United States showed even greater interest in it, attempting to take the opportunity to squeeze out French influence. On March 26th, the United States and Tunisia signed an agreement in which the United States promised to provide Tunisia with $5 million in aid in the form of "commodity lending." According to France's "Express" on April 12th of this year, the United States' loan was conditional. The condition was that Bourguiba try to persuade the Algerian National Liberation Front to compromise on the Algerian issue, and that Nixon try to persuade France to compromise, so that the French and Algerian sides could negotiate a ceasefire before the next session of the United Nations General Assembly.
    Why did the United States suddenly become a "peacemaker" to mediate the Algerian war? The original calculation of the United States was to put together a "Mediterranean Pact" outside of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, so as to form an anti-Soviet and anti-communist strategic system from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to the Baghdad Pact. Let's open the map and take a look. Spain, France, and Italy on the north side of the Mediterranean are already members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and Libya and Morocco on the south side have already built American military bases. If Tunisia and Algeria are added, then this chain can be strung together, and this "vacuum" area in North Africa can become the bag of the Eisenhower Doctrine.
    Another plan of US imperialism is to use Tunisia to organize a so-called North African Federation, so that the United States can replace France in North Africa. The current president of Tunisia was once the initiator of the North African Federation organization. The North African Federation organization was originally proposed by Tunisia, Morocco, and Algeria in order to jointly oppose colonial aggression, safeguard national independence, and support Algeria's struggle for independence. However, the United States is trying to control and use it in order to serve the war policy of US imperialism. It can be seen that US imperialism has become a new and more vicious enemy of the Tunisian people. The Tunisian people must maintain great vigilance against the various aggressive conspiracies of US imperialism in North Africa, especially the attempt to organize a new aggressive bloc - the Mediterranean Pact.
    The Tunisian national leader Bourguiba once said: "Independence is not our ultimate goal, it is only a beginning, it is only the first step." We believe that the Tunisian people, with their heroic tradition of anti-imperialist struggle, will continue to fight against new imperialist aggressive conspiracies and resolutely consolidate national independence!

    突尼斯巩固独立的斗争
　　杨重光
    7月25日，突尼斯制宪议会一致通过废黜突尼斯国王，宣布突尼斯为共和国，从而结束了1705年以来侯赛因王朝在突尼斯的统治。这是继去年3月宣布独立后突尼斯历史上的重大事件。突尼斯共和国的成立，受到了突尼斯人民和各国人民的欢迎。我国政府已于8月2日正式决定承认突尼斯共和国。
    经过七十多年的艰巨斗争而获得独立的突尼斯人民，在过去一年多时间内，曾采取了一系列改革的措施，来巩固民族独立。这些努力已经获得初步的成就。
    突尼斯新的国家机构建立起来了，在宣布独立后第二天组成的布尔吉巴政府掌握了国家政权。一支突尼斯军队建立了，一支国家保安队也建立起来代替了过去的法国宪兵。它废除了法国殖民统治时期的行政体制，新建了十四个以突尼斯人为省长的行省。同时，突尼斯进行了司法改革，实行了妇女也有投票权的选举法，废除了一夫多妻制。今年年初将反动的地主阶级的代表优素福缺席判处死刑，大大地削弱了封建势力。政府并公布法律，废除了王室特权，没收了王室非法取得的财产。这一切都为罢黜国王和建立共和政体准备了条件。
    突尼斯政府在外交政策上遵行万隆会议原则，向好几个国家派出了外交使节并参加了联合国，开始在国际政治舞台上发挥它的作用。
    这些成就鼓舞突尼斯人民为进一步巩固独立而斗争。但是，今天不论在政治上和经济上，在突尼斯人民面前还摆着严重的任务，在为巩固独立而斗争的道路上还有不少的困难。
    突尼斯人民没有忘记，有大约五万名法国军队至今还驻扎在他们的国土上。布尔吉巴曾经说：“不能忘记，在我们的道路上还有不少阻挠，而其中最重要的是在突尼斯领土上还驻有外国军队。”法国的驻军不仅严重危害着突尼斯的民族独立和主权完整，而且法帝国主义还把突尼斯的领土作为进攻阿尔及利亚民族解放军的重要据点。今年5、6月间，法国驻军和突尼斯士兵发生了多次规模相当大的武装冲突。突尼斯许多城市居民在6月9日举行了声势浩大的示威游行，抗议法军在突尼斯领土内继续驻扎，要求法军立即从突尼斯撤退。突尼斯政府也曾多次向法国政府发出照会，要求同法国迅速解决两国有关问题，包括撤退法国军队的问题在内。
    法国殖民者七十五年的残酷统治使突尼斯成为经济十分落后、工业基础极为薄弱的农业国。突尼斯拥有丰富的自然资源，可是这些富源都落在外国帝国主义之手，矿藏、交通运输、煤气、水电、制造业和商业基本上都受法国人的控制。据统计，在三百一十一家五十工人以上的企业里，只有三十三家是属于突尼斯人的。农业也不例外，绝大部分最肥沃的土地都为大殖民者的开发公司所有。法国垄断资本竭力阻止突尼斯在政治上和经济上的改革。法国在突尼斯的投资大量向外抽逃，法国的信贷、保险业务都停止向突尼斯开放。
    殖民统治遗留下来的另一恶果，是失业问题。工人、手工业者小农和城市居民，大部分的经济状况是困难的，差不多半数有劳动力的男人（约四十万人）没有固定收入，处于失业或半失业状态。即使在业的工人，生活也很不安定。因此，突尼斯工人进行了罢工斗争，要求提高工资、改善生活条件和工作条件。政府在农业工人的要求下，曾于1956年4月颁布了农业劳动法，但农业资本家对这个法律实行抵制，仍旧用解雇来威胁工人。政府对铁路的国有化措施原来曾采取一些办法，但遭到了资本家的反对，看来铁路国有化法案将搁置下来。
    突尼斯政府曾设法寻求外援来缓和国内在经济上所遇到的某些困难。法国政府曾同意给突尼斯借款，数目是一百二十一亿法郎，但法国政府于4月3日以种种借口突然宣布停止这笔借款了。针对法国这个决定，突尼斯政府在5月31日决定采取一系列新的措施，包括制定突尼斯自己的关税率（过去突尼斯同法国实行关税同盟），将外汇收归突尼斯政府掌握（过去由法国经营）。
    美国对于突尼斯这个“具有头等重要性的战略地区”是垂涎已久的，早在1950年，美国就取得了在突尼斯建立军事基地的权利。突尼斯宣布独立后，美国对它表示了更大的兴趣，企图趁机把法国势力排挤出去。3月26日美国和突尼斯签订了协定，美国答应以“商品贷予的方式”给突尼斯以五百万美元的援助。据今年4月12日法国“快报”透露，美国给予这笔贷款是有条件的，条件是由布尔吉巴设法说服阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线对阿尔及利亚问题让步，由尼克松设法说服法国让步，以便在下届联合国大会召开前法国和阿尔及利亚双方谈判停火。
    美国为什么突然做起“和事佬”来调停阿尔及利亚的战争呢？原来美国的如意算盘，是要在北大西洋公约以外，拼凑一个“地中海公约”，以便从北大西洋公约到巴格达条约形成一个反苏反共的战略体系。让我们打开地图来看一下，地中海北面的西班牙、法国和意大利已是北大西洋公约的成员，南边的利比亚和摩洛哥都已筑有美国的军事基地，如果再加上突尼斯和阿尔及利亚，那么这个链条就可串起来了，北非这个“真空”地带就可成为艾森豪威尔主义的囊中物了。
    美帝国主义的另一策划，是利用突尼斯出面组织所谓北非联邦，使美国在北非取法国而代之。突尼斯的现任总统曾是北非联邦组织的倡议者，北非联邦组织原为突尼斯、摩洛哥和阿尔及利亚，为了共同反对殖民侵略、维护民族独立和支持阿尔及利亚争取独立的斗争而提出的，但美国却企图加以控制和利用，以便为美帝国主义的战争政策服务。由此可见，美帝国主义已经成为突尼斯人民一个新的更凶恶的敌人。突尼斯人民对于美帝国主义在北非的各种侵略阴谋特别是企图组织新的侵略集团——地中海公约，不能不保持极大的警惕。
    突尼斯的国家领导人布尔吉巴曾经说：“独立不是我们的最终目标，这不过是一个开始，这不过是第一步。”我们相信，具有英勇的反帝斗争传统的突尼斯人民将会为继续反对帝国主义新的侵略阴谋、为坚决巩固民族独立而斗争！
