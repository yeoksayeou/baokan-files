“Only Calculating What Went Out, Not What Came In”

Recently, in the Ning'an Agricultural Cooperative of Xingning County, Guangdong Province, there was a major debate about two different perspectives. Some cooperative members said, "Farmers only support industrial construction, and the state does not help farmers." Is this statement correct? The cooperative director believed this statement was incorrect. He gave everyone a complete accounting: Last year, the entire cooperative had 22 students in universities, 202 students in middle schools, and 774 students in primary schools. The state paid 115,300 yuan annually for education expenses and cultural and health expenses for farmers, 11,970 yuan in agricultural loans, and 750 yuan in relief funds. Last year, the cooperative supported national construction with public grain valued at 18,329 yuan, taxes of 538 yuan, and the purchase of public bonds of 648 yuan, totaling only 19,515 yuan. Compared to the state's support for farmers, the difference is several times over. After this calculation, the cooperative members understood the truth. Li Xirong, an upper-middle peasant cooperative member who previously said the state was exploiting farmers, examined his own mistakes. However, some cooperative members raised another question: If our support for the state is less than the state's help to us, where does the state's construction funds come from? A staff member who had just returned to the cooperative from an enterprise explained to them: The funds for industrial construction mainly come from the accumulation of industrial production departments, commercial departments, and foreign trade, and farmers' support is only a part. This time, everyone understood. Previously, they only saw the public grain and taxes they paid, and forgot the many benefits from the state, only calculating what went out and not what came in.

　　“只计算了出去的，没有计算进来的”
    广东省兴宁县宁安农业社最近在进行两条道路的大辩论当中，有的社员说“只有农民支援工业建设，国家没有帮助农民”这话对不对呢？社主任认为这话不对，他给大家算了个总账：去年全社上学校读书的有大学生二十二人，中学生二百零二人，小学生七百七十四人，国家在这方面每年支付的教育经费和用于农民的文化卫生费用共十一万五千三百元，农业贷款一万一千九百七十元，救济款七百五十元。而去年全社支援国家建设的公粮折值一万八千三百二十九元，税收五百三十八元，购买公债六百四十八元，总共只有一万九千五百一十五元。和国家支援农民的数字对比起来，相差好几倍。这么一算，社员才明白了真相。原来说国家剥削农民的上中农社员李锡荣检讨了自己的错误。不过有的社员又提出了疑问：既然我们支援国家的少于国家帮助我们的，那么国家的建设资金又从何来呢？社里刚从企业回来的一个职员，向他们解释说：工业建设的资金主要是靠工业生产部门、商业部门和对外贸易等方面所积累得来的，农民的支援只是一部分。这一回，大家都认清了。以前只看见自己交的公粮税收，忘了国家多方面的好处，只计算出去的，没计算进来的。（房明）
