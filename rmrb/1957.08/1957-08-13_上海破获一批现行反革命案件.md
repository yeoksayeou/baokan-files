Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 12th: The Shanghai Public Security Bureau recently uncovered a batch of active counter-revolutionary cases.

Among these active counter-revolutionary cases, some counter-revolutionary elements conspired to organize armed support for rightists to carry out anti-socialist activities. The counter-revolutionary element Chen Shunliang, using the pseudonym Li Junyi, secretly plotted counter-revolutionary activities at the home of Huang Junsheng, a teacher and rightist at Caoyang Middle School, on July 18th. He also encouraged Huang to "hold his ground," collect a list of rightists, and formulate a plan of action. However, before Chen's conspiracy could be realized, teachers and students of Caoyang Middle School, as well as Huang Junsheng's mother-in-law, reported him to the public security organs.

Another counter-revolutionary element, Cheng Yuyue, began to win over people dissatisfied with the new society to organize a counter-revolutionary group from March and April of this year. In late May, he and his accomplice, He Jiansheng, discussed several times, plotting to use axes to kill police officers on duty on the road during a heavy rain in the middle of the night, seize their guns, plan to establish the "Chinese Workers' and Peasants' People's Army" and establish a "Workers' and Peasants' Party," and plot to establish a counter-revolutionary base area, preparing to join forces with the rightists for action. However, they were arrested by our public security department according to law just before they attempted to carry out their sabotage activities.

Among these cases, there are also dispatched special agents Lin Yuqiang, Gu Hongsheng and others who sneaked into the Shanghai area from Taiwan to collect military intelligence.

    上海破获一批现行反革命案件
    据新华社上海12日电　上海公安局最近破获一批现行反革命案件。
    在这些现行反革命案件中，有些反革命分子阴谋组织武装支持右派分子进行反社会主义活动。反革命分子陈顺梁化名李君忆，在7月18日到曹杨中学教员、右派分子黄浚思家中密谋进行反革命活动；并鼓动黄要“坚守阵地”，搜集右派分子的名单，制定一套行动计划。但在陈犯的密谋实现以前，曹杨中学的教师、学生以及黄浚思的岳母等就到公安机关检举了他。
    另外一名反革命分子程玉岳从今年3、4月起，就拉拢一些对新社会不满的人组织反革命集团。5月下旬他和同党何建胜几次商议，阴谋在深夜大雨中用斧砍死路上站岗民警，夺取枪枝，策划建立“中国工农人民军”和成立“工农党”，并阴谋建立反革命根据地，准备和右派分子取得联系后一起行动。但是他们在企图进行破坏活动前一刻就被我公安部门依法逮捕。
    在这些案件中，还有从台湾潜入上海地区搜集军事情报的派遣特务林玉强、顾洪生等人。
