The annual grain distribution issue for agricultural production cooperatives has once again been brought before rural work comrades and cooperative cadres. In many agricultural cooperatives in Yuanjiang County, Hunan, according to past methods, the basic grain ration was distributed equally, except for the increased grain production exceeding the "three fix" target, which was distributed according to labor. As long as it was not a cooperative with reduced production, whether it was a newborn infant or a strong, able-bodied full laborer, everyone received the same "grain according to the number of mouths." This method of distribution is inevitably unfair and unreasonable. Especially in cases where an agricultural cooperative's production increase is small or nonexistent, the degree of unfairness and unreasonableness becomes even more prominent. This year, the CCP Changde Prefectural Committee of Hunan Province sent a work team to conduct a "per capita quota" pilot project in the Renyi Agricultural Cooperative in Yuanjiang County. They explored a distribution method that is simple, easy to implement, and relatively reasonable.

The 8th Production Team of the Renyi Agricultural Cooperative has 150 people. Based on a basic grain ration of 520 catties per person, the total basic grain ration should be 78,000 catties, of which: Category 1 – children aged one to three with particularly small consumption: 14 people; Category 2 – people with general consumption: 108 people; Category 3 – able-bodied laborers with particularly large consumption: 28 people.

This team experimented with three formulas for distributing basic grain rations "per capita":

First formula: One category fixed, one category unchanged (distributing a basic grain ration of 520 catties), one category flexible. This method fixes the grain ration for children at 300 catties. This 300 catties is subtracted from the children's basic grain ration of 520 catties, and the difference is added to the basic grain ration of able-bodied laborers. The ration for general people is unchanged; this can be described as a method of "using the small to supplement the large."

As a result of this adjustment, able-bodied laborers can receive a basic grain ration of 630 catties, which is 110 catties more than the original allocation, and is completely sufficient.

Second formula: One category flexible, one category unchanged (distributing a basic grain ration of 520 catties), one category fixed. This method fixes the basic grain ration for able-bodied laborers at 600 catties. The original basic grain ration of 520 catties for able-bodied laborers is then subtracted from 600 catties, and the difference, 80 catties, multiplied by the number of able-bodied laborers, is taken from the children's basic grain ration. The ration for general people is unchanged; it is still a method of "using the small to supplement the large." However, this supplementation is limited, that is, it cannot exceed 80 catties.

With this adjustment, each child can receive an additional 60 catties, which can take care of families without able-bodied laborers. At the same time, since able-bodied laborers work harder, they also receive more grain from increased production bonuses, so raising their ration by only 80 catties is also reasonable.

Third formula: One category fixed, one category increased (exceeding the basic grain ration of 520 catties), one category fixed. This method fixes the basic grain ration for children at 300 catties, and the basic grain ration for able-bodied laborers at 600 catties. The principle for fixing the basic grain ration for these two populations is to ensure that the basic grain ration for the general population is only higher than or equal to 520 catties, and cannot be lower than 520 catties.

As a result of this adjustment, children's grain rations can be satisfied, the basic grain rations for able-bodied laborers can also be increased, and the basic grain rations for general people are also increased by 7.78 catties.

It seems that the first method allows able-bodied laborers to receive the most basic grain rations, and is suitable for cooperatives with fewer grain bonuses from increased production. The second method allows able-bodied laborers to receive fewer basic grain rations than the first method, and is suitable for cooperatives with more grain bonuses from increased production. The third method aims to ensure that able-bodied laborers receive more basic grain rations and that the basic grain rations for general people are also increased, but it is only suitable for cooperatives with more children; otherwise, it will not be feasible.

The above "per capita quota" method for distributing basic grain rations has three advantages: First, it adopts the principle of "using the small to supplement the large" and "using the surplus to make up for the deficiency." It is divided into only three categories, using the children's surplus to supplement the able-bodied laborers' deficiency, with the ration for general people unchanged. The method is simple and clear, and easily understood and mastered by the masses. Second, regardless of which of the above formulas is adopted, the basic grain ration for the general population, which accounts for 72% of the total team population, remains unchanged or is increased, while the basic grain ration for able-bodied laborers, which accounts for 18.7% of the total team population, is greatly increased, making it easily acceptable to the vast majority of the masses. Third, although the grain ration for children, who account for less than 10% of the total team population, is reduced to some extent, they can still receive a minimum of 300 catties and a maximum of 360 catties. Since these children are under three years old, 300 catties is sufficient to meet their needs.

This "per capita quota" method of distributing basic grain rations is very effective in saving grain.

    简易的“按人定量”分粮办法
    李俊国
    农业生产合作社一年一度的口粮分配问题，又提到了农村工作同志和社干部的面前来了。在湖南沅江县许多农业社里，按照过去的办法，除超过“三定”产量的增产部分粮食是按劳分配外，基本口粮是平均分配。只要不是减产社，无论是一个才生下的婴儿，或者是一个身强力壮的整劳力，都是一样的“计口授粮”。这种分法，未免太不公平合理。尤其是在某一农业社增产不多或者没有增产的情况下，不公平合理的程度就显得更加突出。今年，中共湖南省常德地委派了一个工作组，在沅江县人益农业社做了“按人定量”的试点工作，他们摸索出的分配方法简单易行，比较合理。
    人益农业社第八生产大队一百五十人，以每人基本口粮五百二十斤计算，应分基本口粮七万八千斤，其中：第一类——消耗量特别小的一至三岁的小孩十四人；第二类——消耗量一般的一百零八人；第三类——消耗量特别大的整劳力二十八人。
    这个队试验过“按人定量”分配基本口粮的三种公式：
    第一种公式：?类订住，?类不动（分基本口粮五百二十斤），?类灵活。这种方法是将小孩的口粮订住为三百斤，将这三百斤从小孩的基本口粮五百二十斤中减去，其差额添补在整劳力的基本口粮内去分，一般人的不动，可以说是“以小补大”的办法。
    这样调整的结果，整劳力可分得基本口粮六百三十斤，比原来分的多了一百一十斤，完全够吃了。
    第二种公式：?类灵活，?类不动（分基本口粮五百二十斤），?类订住。这种方法是将整劳力分配基本口粮订住为六百斤，再将整劳力原有的基本口粮五百二十斤从六百斤中减去，其差额为八十斤，乘以整劳力的人数，从小孩的基本口粮数字内分出来，一般人的不动，仍旧是“以小补大”的办法。不过这种补法有限制性，即不能超过八十斤。
    这样调整，每个小孩可多分六十斤，可以照顾那些无整劳力的家庭。同时，整劳力既然劳动强，增产分红口粮也就多，只调高八十斤，也是合理的。
    第三种公式：?类订住，?类上升（超基本口粮五百二十斤），?类订住。这种方法是将小孩的基本口粮订住为三百斤，整劳力的基本口粮订住为六百斤，订住这两种人口基本口粮数字的原则，就是要保证一般人口的基本口粮只能高于或等于五百二十斤，不能低于五百二十斤。
    这样调整的结果：小孩的口粮既能满足，整劳力的基本口粮也能增加，并且一般人的基本口粮也增加了七点七八斤。
    看来，第一种方法整劳力分得基本口粮最多，适宜于增产分红口粮较少的社；第二种方法整劳力分得基本口粮比第一种少些，适宜于增产分红口粮较多的社；第三种方法既要保证整劳力的基本口粮多些，又要保证一般人的基本口粮上升，只适宜于小孩较多的社，否则，就办不到。
    上述“按人定量”分配基本口粮的方法有三个优点：第一，采取“以小补大”，“有余补不足”的原则，只分三等，以小孩的有余补整劳力的不足，一般的不动，方法简单明白，群众容易了解，容易为群众所掌握。第二，无论采用上述那种公式分配，占全队总人数72％的一般人口基本口粮都不动，或有所提高，占全队总人数18.7％的整劳力却大大提高了基本口粮，容易为绝大多数群众所接受。第三，占全队总人数不及10％的小孩口粮虽然有所减少，但最低也可分到三百斤，最高达到三百六十斤。这些小孩既在三岁以下，三百斤已能满足需要。
    这种“按人定量”分配基本口粮的方法对节约粮食很有作用。
