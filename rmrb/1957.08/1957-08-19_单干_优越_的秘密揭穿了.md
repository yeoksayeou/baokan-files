In recent months, a fallacy has been circulating in some rural areas of Sichuan Province, claiming that individual farmers also have advantages. Some say there are "three advantages," some say there are "four advantages," and some even say "five advantages" or "six advantages." In summary, it boils down to two points: first, individual farmers eat more grain, and second, they have more pocket money. In areas where these fallacies are prevalent, it is true that some individual farmers eat much more grain and have much more pocket money than ordinary members of agricultural cooperatives. These individual farmers sometimes like to flaunt it in front of the cooperative members. For example, when cooperative members are eating coarse grains, some individual farmers deliberately carry their surplus fine grains to the doorsteps of these cooperative members to dry them in the sun. Some buy wine and meat, inviting neighboring cooperative members to eat at their homes, and after the meal, they ask meaningfully: "Can you afford such dishes and meals as cooperative members?" Landlords and rich peasants with ulterior motives often seize on these events to spread rumors and sow discord. A few cooperative members are confused by this phenomenon and even begin to waver, even wanting to go back to individual farming by withdrawing from the cooperative.

What exactly is going on? Do individual farmers really have advantages? The Jiangjin Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently conducted some investigations and research in places such as Pingqiao Village in Langshan Township, Jiangjin County, and found the answer to this question.

Pingqiao Village has a total of 180 peasant households, only nine of which are individual farmers. The fallacy that individual farmers have several major advantages has also been circulating here, but among the individual farmers, only a few households, such as Bai Bingcheng, Liu Desan, Zhang Changsheng, and Liu Shaohui, actually eat more grain and have more pocket money than ordinary cooperative members. On average, these households eat more than 100 jin of grain per year than cooperative members, and often have hundreds of yuan in income. In the investigation, the work team of the Jiangjin Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party first discovered that the production of individual farmers, especially the rate of increase in production in recent years, lags far behind that of agricultural cooperatives. This is a rice-producing area. Before the establishment of the cooperative, only one crop was grown each year, with an average yield of only over 400 jin per mu. Since last year, the agricultural cooperative has changed to growing two crops of rice; last year, the yield was over 500 jin per mu, and this year it can reach over 700 jin. Those individual farmers with strong labor power and horses still only grow one crop of rice, with yields generally maintained at around 500 jin per mu, and at best, just over 600 jin. Taking sideline production as an example, the average number of pigs raised by the two agricultural cooperatives in the village has reached three per household, while individual farmers average only one and a half per household.

If production is not better than that of agricultural cooperatives, where does the extra grain and money come from? The secret was quickly revealed. It turned out that after agricultural cooperation, some individual farmers saw that the district and township cadres were busy leading the work of the agricultural cooperatives and had no time to attend to other matters, so they used excuses to delay the annual payment of public grain and sell less of the unified purchase grain that should be sold. The district and township cadres had a one-sided understanding of the policy of uniting individual farmers, and therefore accommodated them. Over time, the grain they owed often went unpaid. Three individual farmer households in Pingqiao Village who eat more grain all owed state public grain, and did not sell enough of the unified purchase grain that should have been sold. Among them, Bai Bingcheng, who had the most stored grain, actually harvested 5,910 jin of grain last year, but falsely reported that he only had 2,611 jin. Even so, he still owed 480 jin of public grain and did not pay it. He not only did not sell surplus grain, but also demanded that the state supply him with 100 jin of grain. His family kept an average of 614 jin of grain per person, which is 164 jin more than ordinary cooperative members. In this way, these individual farmers did not produce much grain, but actually ate much more than ordinary cooperative members. The reason why some individual farmers have more pocket money is mainly because they engage in speculative business and evade some of the obligations they should fulfill to the state. Individual farmer Liu Shaohui abandoned production to traffic in piglets, buying them locally at a price of 5 jiao per jin and selling them in Guizhou Province at a high price of 1 yuan and 2 jiao per jin, earning a profit of 100 yuan in two trips. Bai Bingcheng earned more than 550 yuan a year from the fruit business alone. He did not do some of the service labor assigned to him by the state, and all of it was done for him by the agricultural cooperative.

After the origin of the "superiority" of individual farmers was announced, the cooperative members received a profound education. Many cooperative members suggested to the Party branch that in the future, while continuing to unite individual farmers, they should also strengthen education for them and not blindly accommodate them. Some people who had envied them became sober and said that Bai Bingcheng and others are taking the capitalist road, harming others to benefit themselves, and we cannot learn from them. With the help of the people, these individual farmer households also began to realize their mistakes, actively paying the public grain they owed, and two households even proposed joining the cooperative. Several landlords and rich peasant elements who used this opportunity to undermine the agricultural cooperative were finally exposed under the double attack of the cooperative members and individual farmers.

    单干“优越”的秘密揭穿了
    新华社记者　刘宗棠　喻权域
    近几个月来，四川省农村中有些地方流行着一种谬论，说单干户也有优越性。有的说有“三大优越性”，有的说有“四大优越性”，也有说“五大优越性”、“六大优越性”的。归纳起来，不外两点：一是单干户吃的粮食多，一是零花钱多。在这些谬论流行的地方，确实有些单干户的吃粮和零花钱比一般农业社社员多得多。这些单干户有时还喜欢在社员面前炫耀一番。如有的单干户在社员掺吃粗粮的时候，故意把自己多余的细粮挑到这些社员的门前翻晒；有的买酒割肉，邀请邻近社员来家吃饭，吃过后意味深长地问道：像这样的菜饭当社员的恐怕办不起吧？别有用心的地主、富农分子更是常常抓住这些事大肆宣扬，从中造谣挑拨。个别社员为这种现象所迷惑，竟动摇起来，甚至想回过头去退社单干。
    这究竟是怎么一回事呢？单干户真的也有优越性吗？中共江津地方委员会最近在江津县琅山乡平桥村等处作的一些调查研究，找出了这个问题的答案。
    平桥村共有一百八十户农民，只有九户是单干户。这里也曾流行过单干户有几大优越性的谬论，但单干户中真正比一般社员吃粮多、零花钱多的，只有白炳成、刘德三、张长生和刘绍辉等几户。这几户平均一年要比社员多吃一百多斤粮食，并且动辄有成百元的收入。中共江津地方委员会工作队在调查中首先发现的是，单干户的生产，特别是几年来增产的幅度，远落在农业社的后面。这里是水稻产区，建社前每年只种一季，每亩平均产量只有四百多斤。从去年起，农业社改种两季水稻；去年每亩产五百多斤，今年可以达到七百多斤。单干户中人强马壮的人家，至今还只种一季水稻，产量一般每亩保持在五百斤上下，搞得最好的也不过六百多斤。再拿副业生产来说，全村两个农业社养猪数量平均每户已达三只，单干户平均每户只有一只半。
    生产并不比农业社好，那么，多的粮食和钱是那里来的呢？秘密很快被揭穿了。原来农业合作化以后，有些单干户看到区、乡干部忙于领导农业社的工作，无暇他顾，便借故拖欠每年应缴的公粮和少卖应卖的统购粮。区、乡干部对团结单干户的政策理解片面，因而迁就他们。时间一久，他们拖欠的粮食常常不了了之。平桥村三户吃粮多的单干户都拖欠国家公粮，应卖的统购粮也没有卖够。其中存粮最多的白炳成，去年实收粮食五千九百一十斤，虚报说只有二千六百一十一斤。就这样，他还拖欠公粮四百八十斤不交。他不但不卖余粮，反而要求国家供应粮食一百斤。他全家平均每人留粮六百一十四斤，比一般社员多一百六十四斤。这样，这些单干户生产的粮食不多，实际吃到的却大大超过一般社员。有些单干户零花钱多的原因，主要是靠做投机生意和逃避对国家应尽的一些义务。单干户刘绍辉放下生产去贩运小猪，在本地以五角一斤的价格买进，到贵州省以每斤一元二角的高价卖出，两次就获利一百元。白炳成仅经营水果一项，每年收入五百五十多元。国家分配给他的一些勤务劳动，他都没有去做，全是由农业社代他做的。
    单干户“优越性”的来历公布后，社员们受到了一次深刻的教育。许多社员向党支部提出，今后既要继续团结单干户，也要对他们加强教育，不要一味迁就。有些羡慕过他们的人清醒了，说，白炳成他们走的是资本主义道路，损人利己，我们不能跟着他们学。这几户单干户在人们帮助下，也开始认识到自己的错误，积极缴纳拖欠的公粮，有两户还提出入社的要求。几个借此破坏农业社的地主、富农分子，在社员和单干户两面夹攻下，终于暴露出来了。
