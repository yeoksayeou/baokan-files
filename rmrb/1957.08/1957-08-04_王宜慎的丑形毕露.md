    Wang Yishen's Ugly Features Fully Exposed
    (Our report) According to the Shanxi Daily: Wang Yishen, a rightist element from the Shanxi People's Publishing House, attempted to seize leadership of the state-owned publishing house and篡改 its political direction. Recently, his reactionary face has been fully exposed under the denunciation of all employees.
    The rightist element Wang Yishen has long opposed the leadership of the Party. In this rectification movement, he has unleashed even more wild attacks and frantically assaulted the Party. Wang Yishen's anti-Party and anti-socialist spearhead is primarily aimed at the Party's policies and guidelines. He vigorously promoted the "superiority" of "Tongren Publishing House," claiming that he wanted to establish a "Tongren Publishing House" to "compete" with the state-owned publishing house. To achieve this goal, he attempted to negate the achievements of the Shanxi People's Publishing House. Furthermore, he "suggested" that each publishing house should determine its own scope of publication and not implement the central government's guidelines of popularization, localization, and serving the masses. He said that the current shortage and poor quality of publications are due to the "root cause" of this "three-ization".
    Wang Yishen also slandered the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement. He said, "The side effects of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries are significant, frustrating people's emotions." He expressed extreme dissatisfaction with the Party and the state's wage and cadre policies. He said that people's living standards have not improved since liberation, and are even worse than in the past.
    Wang Yishen also incited the masses to be dissatisfied with the Party. He vilified the Party branch committee's joint study of work as engaging in sectarian activities, and insulted activists as "sycophants" and "opportunists." In addition, Wang Yishen even妄想 to abolish the Party's leadership. He put forward a "suggestion" that the Party and the administration should be merged into one, with the administration making proposals and the administration implementing them. He also advocated that only the provincial party committee should be retained, and all grassroots Party organizations should be abolished.
    These reactionary remarks of the rightist element Wang Yishen have been sternly refuted by all the employees of the publishing house.

    王宜慎的丑形毕露
    本报讯　据山西日报报道：山西人民出版社右派分子王宜慎，企图夺取国家出版社的领导权，篡改国家出版社的政治方向。最近，在全社职工的揭发下，他的反动面目已经暴露无遗。
    右派分子王宜慎长期以来反对党的领导。在这次整风运动中，他更大放厥词，疯狂地向党进攻。王宜慎的反党反社会主义的矛头，首先是指向党的政策和方针的。他大肆鼓吹“同人出版社”的“优越性”，声言要创办“同人出版社”同国家出版社“竞争一下”。为了达到这个目的，他企图把山西人民出版社的成绩一笔抹煞。并且，“建议”各出版社自己确定出书范围，不要执行中央规定的通俗化、地方化、群众化的方针。他说，现在出版物又缺又滥，就是出在这个“三化”的“病根”上。
    王宜慎也诽谤肃反运动。他说，“肃反的副作用很大，挫伤了人们的情绪”。他对党和国家的工资、干部政策极表不满。他说，解放以来人民生活没有改善，甚至还不如过去。
    王宜慎还煽动群众对党不满。他污蔑党支部委员在一起研究工作是搞宗派活动，辱骂积极分子为“拍马屁”、“投机分子”。此外，王宜慎甚至妄想取消党的领导。他提出“建议”，要党和行政合而为一，由行政出主张，由行政去执行。并且主张只要留下省委，取消一切党的基层组织。
    右派分子王宜慎的这些反动言论，遭到了全社职工的严正驳斥。
