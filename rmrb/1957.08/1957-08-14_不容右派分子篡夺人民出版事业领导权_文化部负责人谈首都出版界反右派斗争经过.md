Xinhua News Agency, August 13th: The anti-Rightist struggle in the capital's publishing circles has been fully launched on the basis of an initial victory.

According to the person in charge of the Ministry of Culture, this anti-Rightist struggle is being carried out in a situation where the struggles in various grassroots units and the joint struggle of the publishing circles cooperate with each other, attacking from both inside and outside. Since the beginning of last month, the exposure and criticism of the reactionary words and deeds of the Rightists headed by Zeng Yanshu, Lan Jue, Hu Ming, and Xiao Qian have severely hit the Rightists in the publishing circles. In the fifty-six publishing houses in the capital (there are a total of one hundred and five publishing houses in the country), a number of Rightists or Rightist small groups have also been exposed, and fierce struggles have been carried out. Now the Rightists have begun to show signs of collapse, and the struggle is developing in depth, with the results gradually expanding.

The person in charge said that in order to tamper with the political direction of the publishing industry and seize leadership, the Rightists, on the one hand, spread rumors everywhere in society, fundamentally negating the direction and achievements of the publishing industry since liberation. On the other hand, they clamored in various publishing units that "laymen cannot lead experts," attempting to destroy the Party and the state's leadership over the publishing industry.

According to the exposed materials, the Rightists have set fire to all publishing units. For example, Feng Yidai, deputy director of the Chinese Literature Editorial Department of the Foreign Languages ​​Press and chairman of the China Democratic League branch, viciously attacked the Foreign Languages ​​Press as a "family world" of Party members, colluded with and used objects of the anti-suppression campaign to attack the Party, openly demanded the removal of Party member leading cadres, and was elated, preparing to "clean up the mess," spreading rumors that he would serve as deputy director of the Foreign Languages ​​Press. The Rightist clique composed of Shu Wu, Gu Xuejie, and Li Yi in the People's Literature Publishing House insulted the Party member leading cadres of the publishing house as "mediocre talents" who "should be sent to study," and put forward the slogan of "talent returning to the team," privately spreading rumors that non-Party writers would serve as the director. At the same time, they also actively prepared to organize so-called "colleague publications" and "art and literature chronicles" to be used as a retreat when the conspiracy to usurp the People's Literature Publishing House from the inside failed, to confront the classical literature publishing industry led by the Party. Qiu Kehui, deputy director of the People's Communications Publishing House and chairman of the Communications Department of the China Democratic League branch, was Zhang Bojun's "cultural strategist." On the one hand, he sang the high-pitched tune of "colleague publishing house" and "democratic management of the publishing house." On the other hand, he actively wooed responsible cadres and main editors of various departments to participate in the China Democratic League, attempting to completely turn the publishing house into Zhang Bojun's private property. Zhang Xichen of the Ancient Books Publishing House arrogantly fabricated the charges of Wang Naifu, the deputy director of the publishing house, and threatened the Publishing Administration Bureau to remove Wang from his post within a time limit. Liu Longguang, deputy director of the publishing department of the People's Publishing House and chairman of the branch of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, openly declared that the Party member leading cadres of the publishing house were all laymen, believing that "this is a major contradiction," and put forward the slogan of "editors running the publishing house" to abolish the Party's leadership. The anti-Party group headed by Lan Jue and Yu Gan of the Popular Reading Publishing House also advocated turning the "Current Affairs Manual" led by the Party into a "colleague publication" to get rid of the leadership of the Party and the state under the banner of "thoroughly reforming" the publishing industry. Jiang Zeyong, a Rightist of the Foreign Languages ​​Press, openly insulted "the Foreign Languages ​​Press like a medieval feudal aristocratic castle," and arrogantly called on "the people in the castle to 'wake up'," "rush out and converge with the 'masses'," to overthrow the Party.

Not only were the Rightists in the editorial and publishing departments of the publishing houses like this, but the attacks of the Rightists were also rampant in the book and periodical distribution, art design, and other departments for a time. For example, Cao Xinzhi, the leader of the design group of the Fine Arts Publishing House, once slandered the Fine Arts Publishing House as "bureaucratic plus petty bourgeois leadership," and openly demanded that Party member leading cadres step down and get off the sedan chair. He also colluded with Zhang Cizhong of the People's Publishing House, Sun Zheng of the World Knowledge Publishing House, Wei Shuishan of the Finance and Economics Publishing House, and Tang Qi and Lv Jian of the People's Literature Editorial Department to organize the "Bookbinding Association" and the "Bookbinding Design Joint Office" to implement capitalist management, attempting to monopolize the art and bookbinding design industry. Zhang Shiyang, deputy director of the Beijing Fourth Distribution Office of Xinhua Bookstore, was an alternate member of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy. In order to tamper with the political direction of the distribution office, he attempted to develop 50% of the cadres of the office, namely 300 people, into members of the China Association for Promoting Democracy.

The person in charge of the Ministry of Culture said that after the previous stage of struggle, the fallacies of the Rightist backbone elements have been basically defeated, and the ideological understanding of the vast number of publishing cadres has been improved.

The person in charge of the Ministry of Culture finally pointed out that the anti-Rightist struggle in various grassroots units is expanding its results, and the joint struggle in the capital's publishing circles will continue. The work of rectifying while reforming is also being actively carried out. In addition to the improvements that can be made immediately by various grassroots units, plans are being put forward for some more important issues related to the entire publishing work, and decisions are being prepared after discussion to be gradually implemented.

    不容右派分子篡夺人民出版事业领导权
    文化部负责人谈首都出版界反右派斗争经过
    据新华社13日讯　首都出版界的反右派斗争已经在初战胜利的基础上全面展开。
    据文化部负责人对记者说，这次反右派斗争，是在各个基层单位的斗争和出版界联合的斗争相互配合，内外夹攻的形势下进行的。从上月初开始对曾彦修、蓝珏、胡明、萧乾等为首的右派分子的反动言行展开的揭露和批判，给予了出版界的右派分子以严重的打击。在首都五十六个出版社中（全国共有出版社一百零五个），也都揭发出为数不等的右派分子或右派小集团，进行了激烈的斗争。现在右派分子已开始呈现溃退迹象，斗争正向深入发展，战果在逐步扩大中。
    这位负责人说，右派分子为了篡改出版事业的政治方向和夺取领导权，一方面在社会上到处散布空气，根本否定解放以来的出版事业的方针和成绩，另一方面在各出版单位中叫嚣“外行不能领导内行”，妄图把党和国家对出版事业的领导搞垮。
    根据揭发出的材料，右派分子在所有的出版单位都放了火。例如，外文出版社中国文学编辑部副主任和民盟支部主任委员冯亦代，恶毒地攻击外文出版社是党员的“家天下”，拉拢利用肃反被斗对象向党进攻，公开要求撤掉党员领导干部，并得意忘形，准备“收拾残局”，散布要由他担任外文出版社副社长的流言。人民文学出版社由舒芜、顾学颉、李易等人组成的右派小集团，辱骂这个社的党员领导干部都是
  “庸才”，“应该送去学习”，提出所谓“人才归队”的口号，私下散布要由非党作家担任社长。与此同时，他们还积极筹组所谓“同人刊物”“艺文志”，以便从内部篡夺人民文学出版社的阴谋不能得逞时，作为退身之计，与党所领导的古典文学出版事业相抗衡。人民交通出版社副社长、交通部民盟支部主任委员丘克辉是章伯钧的“文化策士”，他一方面高唱“同人出版社”、“民主办社”的滥调，一方面积极拉拢各科室负责干部和主要编辑参加民盟，企图把这个出版社完全变成章伯钧的私产。古籍出版社的章锡琛嚣张地捏造这个社副社长王乃夫的罪状，威胁出版事业管理局限期将王撤职。人民出版社出版部副主任、民主促进会支部主任委员刘龙光，公开扬言这个社党员领导干部全是外行，认为“这是一个主要矛盾”，提出了取消党的领导的“编辑办社”的口号。通俗读物出版社以蓝珏、于干等为首组成的右派反党集团，也打着“彻底改革”出版事业的旗号，主张把党所领导的“时事手册”变成“同人刊物”，摆脱党和国家的领导。外文出版社右派分子江泽墉，更公开辱骂“外文出版社像中世纪的封建贵族古堡”，狂妄地号召“古堡中的人们‘觉醒’过来”，“冲出去和‘群众’汇合”，把党冲垮。
    不但在出版社的编辑和出版等业务部门的右派分子如此，在书刊发行、美术设计等部门，右派分子的进攻，一时也很猖獗。譬如，美术出版社设计组组长曹辛之，曾诬蔑美术出版社是“官僚主义加小商人的领导”，公开要求党员领导干部下台下轿，他还和人民出版社的张慈中、世界知识出版社的孙正、财经出版社的卫水山、人民文学编辑部的唐祈和吕剑等相勾结，活动另外组织“书籍装帧协会”和“书籍装帧设计联合办公室”，实行资本主义的经营，企图垄断书籍的美术装帧设计事业。新华书店北京第四发行所副主任章士敭是民主促进会北京市委的候补委员，他为了篡改这个发行所的政治方向，曾企图将这个所50％的干部即三百人发展为民主促进会的会员。
    文化部负责人说，经过前一阶段的斗争，已经基本上将右派骨干分子的谬论击败，并且提高了广大出版界干部思想认识。
    文化部负责人最后指出，各基层单位的反右派斗争正在扩大战果，首都出版界的联合斗争将继续进行。边整边改的工作，也在积极进行，除各基层单位可以即行改进的已有改进外，有关整个出版工作方面若干较重要的问题，正在提出方案，准备经过讨论，作出决定，逐步予以实现。
