"Walking Out of the Bewildering Maze"
    An Interview with Biologist Tan Jiazhen

    By Our Correspondent Zhang Jing

　　At the Shanghai Natural Science Workers' Symposium on July 18th, Tan Jiazhen, a renowned Chinese biologist of the Morgan school, said with deep feeling: "In the early stages of the rectification campaign, I felt as if I had entered a bewildering maze. Unknowingly, some of my thoughts and remarks were in tune with those of the rightists. Only after the Party's enlightenment and education and my personal participation in the anti-rightist struggle did I realize that I had walked out of the maze."

　  That evening, I went to Mr. Tan's home, wanting to ask him to elaborate on the feelings he expressed during the day. When I arrived at Mr. Tan's residence, he was accompanying his youngest son, enjoying the cool of the evening in the courtyard. Our conversation began right there in the courtyard.

    Mr. Tan is very talkative and speaks in a very organized manner. After I explained my purpose, he began to speak eloquently.

    "When I attended the Central Propaganda Conference in Beijing, I listened to Chairman Mao's report on resolving contradictions among the people. At the time, I felt very excited and secretly harbored a fervent hope: that in the process of correctly resolving contradictions among the people, the unity between the Party and the people would become even closer.

    "But after returning to Shanghai, the atmosphere suddenly changed. Especially around the time of the Shanghai Propaganda Conference, there seemed to be an invisible pressure all around, a pressure that only allowed you to speak ill of the Party and its members, and forbade you from saying anything good about the Party. As the head of the China Democratic League branch at Fudan University, I would sometimes encounter friends within the League who would ask me: 'How is the 'releasing' going at Fudan? You must take the lead!' At League meetings, it also felt as if countless eyes were watching me, wanting me to take the lead in saying some angry words expressing dissatisfaction with the Party. At the League cadre mobilization meeting on May 14th, Shen Zhiyuan's inflammatory report had a very aggressive tone, as if one could not be a League member without speaking ill of the Party. What made a particularly deep impression was that at a municipal committee meeting of the China Democratic League, Xu Jie, the person in charge of the League at East China Normal University, introduced his experience of starting 'fires' with big-character posters at East China Normal University, and received praise from Shen Zhiyuan. Xu Jie also told me very proudly that only big-character posters could solve problems most effectively. At the time, I was confused. I didn't distinguish the nature and purpose of big-character posters. After returning to the university, I discussed with the Party committee about putting up big-character posters at Fudan. I vaguely thought that big-character posters were a form of helping the Party in the rectification campaign. As for the fact that rightists would use big-character posters to engage in 'great democracy,' inciting students to oppose the Party and socialism, I never even considered it.

    "Although external pressure had some influence on me, what was more important was that deep within my own thinking, I still retained bourgeois elements. Although I had complete trust in the Party politically, I had conflicts with the Party on academic and ideological matters, and I was also dissatisfied with some of the Party's specific policies. Therefore, some of my remarks during the 'airing of views' resonated with the rightists. The rightists denied the Party's leadership over science, and I also had doubts about the Party's leadership over science. I have always been very opposed to attaching labels of idealism and materialism to natural science. I remember at a meeting in Tianjin last year to discuss the teaching syllabus, some people insisted that Morgan's school of thought was idealistic and that Michurin and Lysenko's school of thought was materialistic. I was very repulsed by this at the time, and I always felt that the Party was being too arbitrary on scientific issues (this was later corrected at the genetics conference in Qingdao). Therefore, at a science symposium convened by the municipal Party committee on April 20th, I again proposed that to carry out academic debate, the labels of idealism must be removed. Looking back now, my saying this denied the struggle between materialism and idealism in the field of science, which in essence also denied the Party's leadership over science. Of course, indiscriminately labeling people with the label of idealism is a form of arbitrariness. But isn't it also a kind of arbitrariness to say in general terms that we should remove the labels of idealism?

    "At another symposium, I also one-sidedly exaggerated the Party's improper use of senior intellectuals, and even banged the table in excitement. Recalling it now, my mood at the time was very complex. On the one hand, I seemed to know that doing so was already violating my original intention of helping the Party in the rectification campaign, but on the other hand, I was also confused by some of the rightists' remarks, and I also wanted to take this opportunity to vent my personal dissatisfaction. But I never expected that the rightists would use my dissatisfaction to exaggerate and distort my remarks, using them as political capital to attack the Party.

    "What was even more dangerous was that during the most heated period of the airing of views, I had a private conversation with Comrade Wang Ling of the Party committee and informally suggested whether it would be possible to consider the Party and the democratic parties jointly establishing a rectification headquarters. My motivation at the time was that I saw that everyone was raising too many intense opinions against the Party, and I hoped to use the identity of the democratic parties to buffer the situation. Fortunately, Comrade Wang Ling did not express a definitive opinion at the time, and I did not insist. However, at the time, I did not realize that I had made any mistakes.

    "Just at this most dangerous moment, the Party extended a helping hand to me. On the eve of the counterattack against the rightists at Fudan, Comrade Yang Xiguang, the secretary of the Party committee, came to my home and had a sincere and lengthy conversation with me. He analyzed the situation of the rectification campaign, explaining the rightists' conspiracy to use the rectification campaign to oppose the Party and socialism, and also made it clear to me that publishing some extreme and one-sided remarks during the rectification campaign was fundamentally different from the rightists who had ulterior motives. At the same time, he also seriously criticized my proposal for the Party and the democratic parties to jointly establish a rectification headquarters as wrong. He said: 'The rightists are precisely trying to seize the leadership of the rectification campaign in order to stir up trouble and achieve their goal of overthrowing the Communist Party. Although your motives are different from theirs, if they are allowed to participate in the leadership of the rectification campaign, the consequences would be unimaginable.'

    "Comrade Yang Xiguang's words were like giving a feverish patient a cooling medicine, instantly awakening me from my stupor. I realized that I was indeed wrong, and at the same time, I subconsciously had a cowardly thought: to break away from the democratic parties and become a person who devoted himself to science without asking about politics!

    "But I still needed the Party's support. I discussed this idea with Comrade Yang Xiguang again, and he straightforwardly criticized the error of my idea. He said: 'In this struggle, everyone has to undergo a test. The real struggle is already in front of you. Your responsibility is to bravely stand up and meet it, not to escape, shrink back, people who are afraid of tempering will not make any progress.

    "These two conversations gave me great support and strength. I began to walk out of the bewildering maze set up by the rightists and decided to plunge into the fiery struggle against the rightists."

        ×　　×　　×

    I was about to ask Mr. Tan to continue talking about his feelings after participating in the anti-rightist struggle, but the talkative Mr. Tan quickly turned the topic to this issue without waiting for me to ask. He said with great emotion: "Participating in the struggle is not an easy thing either. At first, I was not very firm!

    "The struggle against the rightists in institutions of higher learning started earliest at our Fudan University. The targets of the struggle were first and foremost Chen Renbing and Sun Dayu of the China Democratic League. Originally, I didn't have a good impression of their usual words and deeds, but when the struggle started on the first day, I didn't seem to be so confident and justified. I was afraid that the masses would not support it, and I was afraid that the struggle would not unfold. Therefore, when I presided over the meeting, I was very timid, afraid of saying the wrong thing. However, the progress of the meeting did not go as I had estimated. Many people boldly exposed Chen Renbing and Sun Dayu's anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds. Undoubtedly, this was a very practical education for me. I began to feel that I was not isolated, and that the truth was on our side.

    "The in-depth development of the anti-rightist struggle and the large amount of materials exposed in the newspapers gradually made me see the ugly souls of those rightists. I thought that if the rightists were to come to power one day, what about socialist construction? What about the future of intellectuals? As soon as I thought of this, I developed hatred for the rightists emotionally. I was determined to fight them to the end."

    As he said this, Mr. Tan's voice became excited. At this time, hailstones the size of soybeans fell from the sky, but he didn't seem to notice. We moved the chairs to the reception room. Mr. Tan wiped the rain off his body and said with a sense of feeling: "This struggle is like this heavy rain. Although my clothes are wet, my mind has become clear."

    While Mr. Tan was busy arranging the seats, I roughly browsed this reception room. The room was not large, but it was simply and neatly furnished. A large photo of Chairman Mao was hanging on the wall. Mr. Tan saw me looking at this photo and talked to me about his impression of Chairman Mao's visit to Shanghai this time. He said: "That night, Chairman Mao specially invited some of us intellectuals to talk to him. As soon as he saw me entering the door, he shook my hand as if meeting an old friend and said repeatedly: 'You are the famous geneticist Mr. Tan Jiazhen! We are already old friends, old friends!' Then he asked me how my work was going? How was my health? I was deeply moved at the time. I thought that Chairman Mao had only met me twice in total, but he remembered my name so clearly, and he cared for me and was so kind as if I were an old friend. Looking at his kind face and listening to his earnest talk, a feeling of shame rose in my heart. I was ashamed that I had not been able to be a good assistant to the Party in this rectification campaign, and I had almost been pulled into a trap by the rightists. But I also felt very fortunate, fortunate that I had always maintained my trust in the Party and had always received the Party's support and help in this test, so that the China Democratic League at Fudan did not go astray in this serious struggle. In the future, I can only more conscientiously transform my standpoint and become a socialist scientific worker."

    Our conversation continued for more than two hours. When I said goodbye to Mr. Tan, the sound of rain outside had stopped, but the stars in the sky were denser than before. When Mr. Tan opened the door to see me out, he said meaningfully: "Now it's sunny again after the rain. Only those who have fought against wind and rain will feel how precious the clear sunny day is!"

    “从迷魂阵里走出来”
    访生物学家谈家桢先生
    本报记者　张竞
　　在7月18日上海自然科学工作者座谈会上，我国有名的摩尔根学派的生物学家谈家桢先生，深有感受地说：“整风初期，我好像进入了迷魂阵似的，自己的某些思想言论不知不觉的和右派分子合了拍子，经过党的启发教育和亲身参与反右派斗争，才觉得已从迷魂阵里走了出来。”
　  当天晚上，我到谈先生家里去，想请他详细谈谈白天所说的体会。我找到谈先生宿舍时，他正陪着最小的儿子在院子里乘凉。我们的谈话就在院子里开始了。
    谈先生很健谈，说话也很有条理，等我说明来意后，他就滔滔不绝地讲了起来。
    “我在北京参加中央宣传会议时，听了毛主席关于解决人民内部矛盾的报告，当时觉得很兴奋，私心里怀着一种热切的愿望：希望在正确地解决人民内部矛盾过程中，党和人民之间的团结，会更加亲密起来。
    “可是回到上海以后，气氛突然变了。尤其是上海宣传会议前后，周围好像有一股无形的压力，这种压力叫你只能说党和党员的坏话，不许说党的好话，我是复旦大学民盟支部的负责人，有时碰到盟内的朋友，人家就问我：‘复旦放得怎么样？你要带头呀！’盟内开会时，也觉得有无数眼睛盯着我，要我带头说一些气愤的对党不满的话。在5月14日的盟干部动员大会上，沈志远那篇煽动性的报告，很有一种咄咄逼人的味道，好像不说党的坏话，就不能做一个盟员。印象特别深的是在一次民盟市委的会议上，华东师大民盟负责人许杰介绍他在华东师大办大字报‘放火’的经验，得到了沈志远的赞扬。许杰还很得意地告诉我，只有办大字报最能解决问题。当时，我就被迷糊了，我并没有去辨别大字报的性质和目的，回校后，就和党委商量在复旦也搞起大字报来。我只是模糊的以为大字报是帮助党整风的一种形式，至于右派分子会利用大字报来搞‘大民主’，煽动学生反党反对社会主义，这一点，我却万万没有想到。
    “外部的压力对我虽有影响，但更重要的是在我自己的思想深处，也保留着资产阶级的东西，我在政治上虽然对党是完全信任的，但在学术思想上和党有抵触，对党的某些具体政策上，我也有不满意的地方，所以我在鸣、放中的有些言论，便和右派分子一拍即合了。右派分子否认党对科学的领导，我对党对科学的领导也有怀疑，我一直很反对在自然科学的头上加上唯心主义和唯物主义的帽子，记得去年在天津讨论教学大纲的会议上，有人硬把摩尔根的学派肯定是唯心的，把米丘林、李森科学派肯定是唯物的，我当时就非常反感，总觉得党在科学的问题上太武断了（后来在青岛的遗传学会议上纠正了）。因此，我在4月20日市委召开的科学座谈会上，又提出要在学术上展开争鸣，必须摘掉唯心主义的帽子。现在想起来，我讲这话是否认
  了唯物主义和唯心主义在科学领域中的斗争，实质上也就是否认了党对科学的领导。当然，不加分析地给人戴唯心主义的帽子，是一种武断。可是一概而论地说要摘掉唯心主义的帽子，不也是一种武断吗？
    “另一次座谈会上，我又片面地夸大了党对高级知识分子使用不当的情况，甚至激动得拍起桌子来。现在回忆起来，我当时的心情是很复杂的，一方面我似乎明知这样做已经违反了我帮助党整风的初衷，但另一方面又被右派分子的某些言论所迷惑，也想趁此机会发泄一下个人的不满。可是我万万想不到右派分子就利用我的这些不满，把我的言论夸大歪曲，作为向党进攻的政治资本。
      “更危险的是在鸣放最热烈的时期，我和党委王零同志个别交谈意见时，曾经非正式的提出是否可考虑党和民主党派共同成立整风指挥部。我当时的动机是因为看到大家对党的意见提得太激烈，希望以民主党派的身份来从中缓冲一下。幸亏当时王零同志未置可否，我也没有坚持。可是，当时我并没有觉察到自己有什么错误。
      “就在这最危险的关头，党向我伸出了援救的手，在复旦反击右派分子的前夕，党委书记杨西光同志到我家来，诚恳地和我作了一次长谈，他分析了整风的形势，说明右派分子正想利用整风反党反社会主义的阴谋，也很明确地告诉我整风中发表一些偏激的片面的言论是和别有用心的右派分子有根本区别的。同时他也很严肃地批评了我所提出的党和民主党派共同成立整风指挥部的要求是错误的，他说：‘右派分子正是想争夺整风的领导权，以便他们兴风作浪，达到他们整垮共产党的目的，你的动机虽和他们不一样，但如果让他们参加整风的领导，后果是不堪设想的。
      “杨西光同志的一席话，像给了一个发高热的病人下了一付清凉剂，使我顿时从昏迷中惊醒过来，我发现自己确实错了，同时还下意识地产生了一个懦弱的念头：脱离民主党派，做一个不问政治埋头钻研科学的人吧！
      “可是我还是需要党的支持。我把我的这个念头又和杨西光同志谈了，他很直爽地批评了我这个想法的错误。他说：“在这场斗争中，任何人都得经历一次考验，现实的斗争已经摆在你的面前，你的责任是勇敢地站起来迎接它，而不是逃避、畏缩，害怕锻炼的人，是不会有什么进步的。
      “这两次谈话，给了我很大的支持和力量，我开始从右派分子布设的迷魂阵里走出来，决心投入反右派的火热的斗争中去。”
        ×　　×　　×
    我正想请谈先生继续谈他在参加反右派斗争后的感想，健谈的谈先生不等我发问，很快就把话题转到这问题上来。他很感慨地说：“参加斗争也不是件容易的事，一开始我还不是很坚决的哩！
      “高等学校反击右派分子的斗争，我们复旦搞得最早，斗争的对象首先就是民盟的陈仁炳、孙大雨，本来我对他们平时的言行举止并没有好感，可是第一天开始斗争时，总好像不那么理直气壮，怕群众不支持，怕斗争展不开，所以主持会议时，心里很胆怯，生怕说错了话。可是，会议进展的情况并不如我所估计的那样，很多人都大胆地揭露了陈仁炳、孙大雨的反党、反社会主义的言行，无疑的这对我是一个很实际的教育，我开始感觉到自己并不孤立，而且真理是在我们这一边的。
      “反右派斗争的深入开展，和报纸上大量揭发出来的材料，使我逐渐看清了那些右派分子的丑恶的灵魂，我想假使有朝一日让右派分子来当朝执政，还谈什么社会主义的建设？谈什么知识分子的前途？一想到这里，就从感情上产生了对右派分子的仇恨，我下定决心，要和他们坚决斗争到底。”
      说到这里，谈先生的声音变得激动了。这时天上掉下黄豆大的雨点，他也好像没有觉得。我们把椅子搬到会客室里，谈先生一面擦着身上的雨水，一面若有所感地说：“这场斗争，就好像这场大雨似的，虽然衣服淋湿了，头脑可也清醒过来了。”
    趁着谈先生忙着安排坐椅的时候，我粗粗地浏览了一下这个会客室，屋子不大，陈设得却很简朴而整洁，墙上挂着一张毛主席的放大照相，谈先生见我注视着这张照片，他又和我谈起了毛主席这次来上海给他的印象。他说：“那天晚上，毛主席特地找了我们一些知识分子去谈心，他一见我进门，就如逢故友似的握着我的手连连地说：
  ‘你就是那位有名的遗传学家谈家桢先生吧！我们已经是老朋友，老朋友了！’接下去他又问我工作的怎么样？身体怎么样？我当时就受了很深的感动，我想毛主席总共只和我见过两次面，就那么清楚地记住了我的名字，而且把我当作老朋友那样的关怀、亲切。我看着他那样慈祥的面容，听着他那样恳切的谈吐，我心里油然升起了一种惭愧的感觉，我惭愧的是没有能在这次整风中做好党的助手，还险些儿被右派分子拉下了陷井。但是我又感到很幸运，幸运的是我始终保持着对党的信任，始终在这场考验中得到了党的支持和帮助，使复旦的民盟没有在这次严重的斗争中走到歧路上去。今后，我只有更认真地改造自己的立场、做一个社会主义的科学工作者。”
    我们的谈话继续了两个多小时，当我和谈先生告别的时候，外面的雨声已停，天空的星星却比前更密了。谈先生开门送我出来时，意味深长地说：“现在又是雨过天晴了，只有和风雨搏斗过的人，才更加觉得明朗的晴天是多么可贵！”
