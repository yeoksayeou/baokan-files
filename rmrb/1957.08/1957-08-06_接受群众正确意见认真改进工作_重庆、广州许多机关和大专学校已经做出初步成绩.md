Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, August 5th: Chongqing's various agencies and universities are actively improving their work based on the correct opinions raised by the masses during the rectification movement.

The Chongqing Municipal People's Committee, based on the opinions of non-Party figures regarding strengthening collective leadership, has formulated specific improvement measures: Members of the People's Committee can, based on their willingness and expertise, organize several groups to participate in the Municipal People's Committee's research on relevant major issues, read relevant documents, and can, through certain procedures, collectively or individually, regularly or irregularly, inspect the work of various departments under the municipality. The Municipal People's Procuratorate adopted suggestions on improving the connection between leadership and the masses; most sections and offices have eliminated the group leader level, and section chiefs personally review case files and examine evidence. The Municipal Health Bureau also stipulates that responsible cadres should regularly participate in outpatient, nursing, and vaccination work in hospitals. The Southwest Industrial Architectural Design Institute, based on mass opinions, has changed its method of reviewing blueprints.

Major universities have also taken a series of measures to improve shortcomings in their work.

Many units have also proactively improved phenomena such as the special treatment of some leading cadres and insufficient concern for the hardships of the masses. Responsible cadres of the Chongqing Commercial Bureau, Second Industrial Bureau, Finance Bureau, Labor Bureau, and more than a dozen other units have voluntarily given up some of their houses and furniture to alleviate the housing difficulties of employees. Some leading cadres from the Urban Services Bureau, Public Utilities Bureau, Supervision Bureau, Planning Commission, and other units have also voluntarily returned inappropriately subsidized expenses from the past.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 5th: Guangzhou's first batch of rectification units, in the struggle against bourgeois right-wing elements, continue to seriously handle the various well-intentioned criticisms and suggestions raised by the people and cadres during the rectification movement.

The municipal commercial departments, based on mass opinions, have strengthened the organization of goods, and the market supply situation has improved, with a slight decrease in the price of non-staple foods. Since July, various companies have also accepted mass opinions in the allocation of goods and have canceled the practice of bundling substandard goods.

The Guangzhou Municipal Party Committee has also sent the issues raised by industrial and commercial figures in the ten forums held by the Municipal Party Committee to relevant units for research and handling. Regulations have been made on 105 issues, such as the concurrent positions and salaries of private personnel, the viewing of documents by private personnel, and the scope of participation in meetings. After careful research, the industrial system has resolved 24 major and minor issues related to employee welfare. The Urban Construction Committee has also accepted mass opinions and reviewed past land use. The Port Authority has accepted the reasonable demands of the dockworkers and built sunshades on the wharves from Dongdi to Xidi, and helped more than 400 employee households repair their houses.

In the cultural field, the Municipal Culture Bureau, in order to solve the problems existing in the municipal Cantonese opera troupes, has decided to make a comprehensive adjustment to the Cantonese opera troupes. The Culture Bureau has also strengthened its guidance work for the cultural centers in various districts and has allocated 46,000 yuan to solve the problem of establishing small stages in most district cultural centers. The Municipal Sports Commission has resolved the problem raised by school teachers regarding the difficulty of participating in sports activities in sports venues. Various units have also handled some issues related to the living welfare of staff members.

The leading cadres of many units also frequently go deep into the lower levels to understand the work situation and talk with cadres, workers, and students. Every member of the Standing Committee of the Municipal Party Committee has directly established contact with some grassroots units. Leading cadres of the Municipal People's Committee, the People's Committees of various districts, the Municipal Public Security Bureau, the Municipal People's Court, and the Municipal People's Procuratorate have stipulated specific times and detailed methods for receiving the masses and listening to the opinions and requests of the people.
